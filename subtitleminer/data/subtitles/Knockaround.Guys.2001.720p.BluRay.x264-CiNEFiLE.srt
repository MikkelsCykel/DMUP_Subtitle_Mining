1
00:01:11,927 --> 00:01:13,338
Nervous, huh, kid?

2
00:01:48,338 --> 00:01:51,790
Matty,
when your father went away...

3
00:01:51,884 --> 00:01:54,256
I welcomed him asking me
to look after you.

4
00:01:54,344 --> 00:01:56,136
I considered it an honour.

5
00:01:56,221 --> 00:01:58,712
And not because
he was Benny Chains...

6
00:01:58,807 --> 00:02:02,306
or because your mother was
my sister, but because of you.

7
00:02:02,394 --> 00:02:04,967
Ever since you were
a little kid, you been nails--

8
00:02:05,063 --> 00:02:07,435
tough as fucking nails.

9
00:02:07,524 --> 00:02:10,276
When you go down there,
be decisive...

10
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,436
because that is
the motherfucker...

11
00:02:12,529 --> 00:02:16,147
who is responsible
for your pop being sent away.

12
00:02:17,701 --> 00:02:22,410
Matty, tonight is the night
that you become a man.

13
00:03:05,832 --> 00:03:08,786
This is all wrong.
Totally all wrong.

14
00:03:08,877 --> 00:03:11,961
Teddy, you know.
You got to know.

15
00:03:12,047 --> 00:03:15,997
Guys, this is Bobby Boulevard.

16
00:03:16,092 --> 00:03:18,381
That's the life, Matty.

17
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:21,139
It's always the guy
you don't want it to be.

18
00:03:21,223 --> 00:03:23,381
Hey, Matty.

19
00:03:23,475 --> 00:03:26,048
How you doin', kiddo?

20
00:03:26,144 --> 00:03:27,175
Hey, Bobby.

21
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:38,023
Oh, no, Matty. Matty, come on.

22
00:03:38,114 --> 00:03:42,492
Why would l want to rat
on anyone? No.

23
00:03:42,577 --> 00:03:45,151
Come on. Hey, hey, Matty...

24
00:03:45,247 --> 00:03:48,532
who taught you
the hook serve, huh?

25
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:51,626
Got you 7 points off your dad
first time you ever set foot...

26
00:03:51,711 --> 00:03:53,870
on a handball court
with him, huh? Who?

27
00:03:53,964 --> 00:03:55,873
You did, Bobby.

28
00:03:55,966 --> 00:03:59,833
You remember the time l got you
that bundle of "Hustlers," huh?

29
00:03:59,928 --> 00:04:02,004
You made a fuckin' fortune...

30
00:04:02,097 --> 00:04:04,136
selling 'em to those kids
at Aquinas Prep.

31
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:08,174
Wasn't me, l swear.
I'm no informant.

32
00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:11,685
Shut the fuck up!

33
00:04:19,197 --> 00:04:21,818
I feel better already.

34
00:04:21,908 --> 00:04:25,359
Come on, Matty. Now's the time
for stomach, son. OIK?

35
00:04:25,453 --> 00:04:28,988
You gotta decide,
does this guy live or die?

36
00:04:29,082 --> 00:04:30,956
Come on.

37
00:04:37,757 --> 00:04:40,842
Just give the trigger
a gentle squeeze.

38
00:05:03,783 --> 00:05:06,903
I'm sorry, Uncle Teddy.

39
00:05:09,205 --> 00:05:11,957
It's all right. It's fine.
Don't worry about it.

40
00:05:14,043 --> 00:05:19,204
Look, you're not cut out
for this. We know that now.

41
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,462
Go on outside.

42
00:05:30,226 --> 00:05:32,183
What are you gonna do to him?

43
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:36,184
Nothin' much.
Bang him around a little bit.

44
00:05:36,274 --> 00:05:38,148
Move him outta town.

45
00:05:38,234 --> 00:05:41,152
It's your fuckin'
lucky day, Bob.

46
00:05:42,947 --> 00:05:46,067
Go on. Here.
Make yourself a phone call.

47
00:06:26,365 --> 00:06:28,323
Sure. OIK, Jill.

48
00:06:28,409 --> 00:06:31,695
Right. I'll see you
at the stadium. Bye.

49
00:06:31,788 --> 00:06:34,742
So, Mr. Demaret.

50
00:06:34,832 --> 00:06:37,703
- Matty.
- Matty. Fine.

51
00:06:37,794 --> 00:06:40,960
So, personnel tells me you were
up for an assistant's Job...

52
00:06:41,047 --> 00:06:44,131
but you got Joanne over there
to convince me to meet with you.

53
00:06:44,217 --> 00:06:47,301
- So...
- Excuse me.

54
00:06:50,097 --> 00:06:53,466
So, l want to be an agent,
you know, a sports agent.

55
00:06:53,559 --> 00:06:56,346
And why am l gonna
make you that?

56
00:06:56,437 --> 00:06:58,015
Well, honestly, Mr. McCreedle...

57
00:06:58,105 --> 00:07:00,015
I think l been preparing for it
my whole life.

58
00:07:00,107 --> 00:07:02,230
When l was a kid,
l started going to ball games...

59
00:07:02,318 --> 00:07:04,394
and l remember spending
a lot of time alone...

60
00:07:04,487 --> 00:07:06,729
but l could always count on
ball season to keep me company.

61
00:07:06,822 --> 00:07:09,907
I had this uncle in the ushers
and ticket taker union...

62
00:07:09,992 --> 00:07:12,068
Local 176, so l got to know
all the ushers...

63
00:07:12,161 --> 00:07:14,154
at Yankee Stadium and Shea, too.

64
00:07:14,247 --> 00:07:16,156
Before l knew it,
l was wired at the Garden...

65
00:07:16,249 --> 00:07:18,206
and l never missed
a Rangers or a IKnick game.

66
00:07:18,292 --> 00:07:21,163
As far back as l can remember,
working with ball players...

67
00:07:21,254 --> 00:07:22,629
was really
all l ever wanted to do.

68
00:07:22,713 --> 00:07:27,506
Well. Good patter. Yeah,
let's see what's on the page.

69
00:07:32,431 --> 00:07:35,005
"Bachelor in sports marketing."

70
00:07:35,101 --> 00:07:38,849
- Work..."Ubonne Plumbing"?
- That's right.

71
00:07:38,938 --> 00:07:41,773
Now defunct.
You were the president.

72
00:07:43,693 --> 00:07:48,651
"White's Taxi and Livery."
Also president.

73
00:07:50,241 --> 00:07:52,946
"Gianda's Catering Hole."

74
00:07:56,998 --> 00:07:59,951
That's Benny Chains' place,
right?

75
00:08:00,042 --> 00:08:03,874
Yeah, that's correct.
He owns it.

76
00:08:03,963 --> 00:08:07,296
So, are you, like,
related to him?

77
00:08:07,383 --> 00:08:10,218
Yes, l am. He's my father.

78
00:08:12,638 --> 00:08:15,390
Well, that's
a pretty close relation.

79
00:08:17,435 --> 00:08:19,511
Well, you've got enthusiasm...

80
00:08:19,603 --> 00:08:22,355
but there's nothing in
your Job experience for me to--

81
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,109
- Listen, l know--
- No, l'm glad that you came in.

82
00:08:25,192 --> 00:08:27,232
I know what you're thinking,
because l've heard it before.

83
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:29,312
It's always
the same story for me.

84
00:08:29,405 --> 00:08:31,694
I get cold-cocked the minute
my father's name is mentioned.

85
00:08:31,782 --> 00:08:37,287
You gotta Just--
you can do this, all right?

86
00:08:37,371 --> 00:08:40,705
Look past the name
and Just hire yourself a guy...

87
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:43,413
who's gonna bust his hump
every day for you. Gimme a--

88
00:08:43,502 --> 00:08:47,500
Let me stop you right there.
You put on a good show...

89
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:50,128
but l think l know what
you're really trying to do here.

90
00:08:50,217 --> 00:08:53,052
You come on all nice
and respectable...

91
00:08:53,137 --> 00:08:56,257
then l hire you, and then
you lay the strong arm on me.

92
00:08:56,348 --> 00:08:57,511
Would you Just hear me out?

93
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,798
When my father started
this place...

94
00:08:58,893 --> 00:09:00,719
you know how many guys
like you and your father...

95
00:09:00,811 --> 00:09:02,186
tried to break off a piece?

96
00:09:02,271 --> 00:09:04,560
I'll tell you what he told them:
go whistle.

97
00:09:04,648 --> 00:09:06,024
All respect,
but you've got me wrong.

98
00:09:06,108 --> 00:09:07,650
Do l?

99
00:09:07,735 --> 00:09:12,646
I'm here for a Job, all right?
Just a fucking Job.

100
00:09:14,658 --> 00:09:16,450
In what prosecutors
are calling...

101
00:09:16,535 --> 00:09:18,611
a death knell
for organised crime...

102
00:09:18,704 --> 00:09:21,705
indictments have been
handed down across the board.

103
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:24,032
The government's case
is only the latest blow...

104
00:09:24,126 --> 00:09:26,202
to the weakening
power structure of--

105
00:09:46,106 --> 00:09:47,351
That's game!

106
00:09:49,443 --> 00:09:53,737
I set you up for that.
Nice fuckin' yonkas, Benny.

107
00:09:53,822 --> 00:09:57,191
Too good.
The man is too fucking good.

108
00:09:57,284 --> 00:09:59,775
That's why he is the boss.

109
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,448
Towel.

110
00:10:01,538 --> 00:10:04,575
You know why
your dad's so hard to beat?

111
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:08,118
Most guys let it bounce,
but Benny Chains anticipates.

112
00:10:08,212 --> 00:10:10,453
He charges, no hesitation.

113
00:10:12,132 --> 00:10:13,792
What's that, Manganaros?

114
00:10:13,884 --> 00:10:15,793
Yeah. I was in the city
on an interview.

115
00:10:15,886 --> 00:10:17,795
Got you guys
some of the good stuff.

116
00:10:17,888 --> 00:10:23,131
- Another sport agency?
- Yeah. Last one, too.

117
00:10:23,227 --> 00:10:26,596
Fuck 'em. You know, Teddy,
in the last year...

118
00:10:26,688 --> 00:10:28,847
I been to over fourteen
interviews.

119
00:10:28,941 --> 00:10:31,811
Various companies,
same result-- door slammin'.

120
00:10:31,902 --> 00:10:35,567
Listen, to those cocksuckers,
you are what we are.

121
00:10:35,656 --> 00:10:37,399
Yeah, well, they're right.

122
00:10:37,491 --> 00:10:39,530
It's time
l did something about it.

123
00:10:39,618 --> 00:10:42,156
- Hey, all right.
- Hey, the champ!

124
00:10:42,246 --> 00:10:43,444
What about another one?

125
00:10:43,539 --> 00:10:46,824
Jesus, that was quick.
Mercy rule?

126
00:10:46,917 --> 00:10:50,167
Well, you know, closed 'em out!

127
00:10:50,254 --> 00:10:53,171
The man was outclassed.
What can l tell ya?

128
00:10:53,257 --> 00:10:55,498
I got somethin' for ya.

129
00:10:55,592 --> 00:10:59,341
OIK, Just in time. Here.
Couple of scoots, huh?

130
00:11:01,223 --> 00:11:02,598
That from Cristian?

131
00:11:02,683 --> 00:11:08,223
Yeah. The man's a sport,
a gentle, likeable guy.

132
00:11:08,313 --> 00:11:11,599
I never paid a check
in his Joint in the old days.

133
00:11:11,692 --> 00:11:13,980
I feel half-bad
about collectin' this.

134
00:11:14,069 --> 00:11:15,397
So, why did you?

135
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:19,189
We got to.
We're collectin' everywhere.

136
00:11:19,283 --> 00:11:21,156
Guys supposed
to be comin' across...

137
00:11:21,243 --> 00:11:24,409
with a set amount every week
aren't hittin' their figures.

138
00:11:24,496 --> 00:11:26,453
How are we gonna
kick it up above...

139
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,579
if it doesn't flow
into us first?

140
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:31,584
You figure they're holdin' out
or Just not earnin'?

141
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:34,587
Not earnin'?
There is no not earnin'.

142
00:11:34,673 --> 00:11:36,464
You think people
stopped fuckin'...

143
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:38,792
and stopped bettin' and stopped
borrowin' this month?

144
00:11:38,885 --> 00:11:42,171
What the fuck's the matter
with you? You don't get it?

145
00:11:42,264 --> 00:11:45,514
Someone's stealing from us.

146
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,804
Look, Pop,
is there anything l can do?

147
00:11:48,895 --> 00:11:53,356
Nah. Nothin' for you to sweat.
We're workin' it out.

148
00:11:53,442 --> 00:11:56,478
Come on. Teddy,
would you help me out here?

149
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:57,850
You said it yourself.

150
00:11:57,946 --> 00:12:00,733
Outside of Brooklyn,
no one's gonna give me a shot.

151
00:12:00,824 --> 00:12:04,407
What are you complainin' about?
You drive a Cadillac.

152
00:12:04,494 --> 00:12:08,706
Look, Pop, l got a handle
on the low-level stuff...

153
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:11,198
keepin' the taxis running,
overseeing the crap games...

154
00:12:11,293 --> 00:12:13,250
the odd union meeting,
but it's time.

155
00:12:13,336 --> 00:12:15,294
I'm ready to step up.

156
00:12:17,048 --> 00:12:18,626
If you're Jammed up here...

157
00:12:18,717 --> 00:12:20,793
there's gotta be somethin'
l can do, right?

158
00:12:20,886 --> 00:12:26,556
You brought us the sandwiches!
What else can you do?

159
00:12:28,101 --> 00:12:29,809
Listen, l'll see you later.

160
00:12:43,533 --> 00:12:45,193
Hey, Tony.

161
00:12:47,996 --> 00:12:52,290
These ladies-- their check
is on us today, OIK?

162
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:53,953
Of course.

163
00:12:56,755 --> 00:13:00,835
For dessert,
you can go powder your noses.

164
00:13:00,926 --> 00:13:03,463
Just leave your numbers
with Tony.

165
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:07,256
Listen, Chris,
not for nothin'...

166
00:13:07,349 --> 00:13:09,590
but your old man's
not gonna like this.

167
00:13:09,684 --> 00:13:12,769
He says no more checks
on the arm for random broads.

168
00:13:12,854 --> 00:13:15,060
You're hurtin' him too much
ever since that bachelor list...

169
00:13:15,148 --> 00:13:17,057
came out in the "Post."

170
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:21,361
What do you want me to tell ya?
The ladies love me.

171
00:13:21,446 --> 00:13:22,726
What's up?

172
00:13:26,618 --> 00:13:29,987
Why is it every Junkie
thinks newspaper cleans glass?

173
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,989
Couldn't tell ya.

174
00:13:32,082 --> 00:13:34,205
Here ya go. Thanks, chief.

175
00:13:34,292 --> 00:13:36,961
No, don't do that.

176
00:13:37,045 --> 00:13:38,705
That's extortion,
for Christ's sake.

177
00:13:38,797 --> 00:13:41,751
The window's even dirtier
than it was before.

178
00:13:41,841 --> 00:13:44,130
Come on,
what's the matter with you?

179
00:13:44,219 --> 00:13:47,469
Guy's got the worst Job
in the world.

180
00:13:47,555 --> 00:13:51,767
Nah, worst Job has gotta be
mop boy at Show World.

181
00:13:51,851 --> 00:13:53,808
I'll tell you what,
l'm not moppin' up spooge...

182
00:13:53,895 --> 00:13:55,769
but it's not that fun
for me anymore.

183
00:13:55,855 --> 00:13:59,141
I never thought
l'd have a fuckin' Job.

184
00:13:59,234 --> 00:14:02,852
My father wants me to have
5 days a week-- Iunch and dinner.

185
00:14:02,946 --> 00:14:04,606
Man, when l was growin' up...

186
00:14:04,697 --> 00:14:07,402
I didn't see him running
no diner room lunch and dinner.

187
00:14:07,492 --> 00:14:08,951
You got that right.

188
00:14:09,035 --> 00:14:13,115
Man had crews running while
he sat there at the Bergen...

189
00:14:13,206 --> 00:14:15,163
sippin' his espresso
and countin' money.

190
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,954
Yeah, but he had to get out.
You know that.

191
00:14:18,044 --> 00:14:20,665
Another conviction,
he'd be gone for life, right?

192
00:14:20,755 --> 00:14:24,124
But he's still named Scarpa,
and where does that leave me?

193
00:14:24,217 --> 00:14:26,008
With a small piece
of a restaurant...

194
00:14:26,094 --> 00:14:28,336
and all the hassles
of his old life.

195
00:14:28,429 --> 00:14:35,143
Bad press. Fed surveillance.
Liquor board shakedowns.

196
00:14:35,228 --> 00:14:40,519
Not to mention people whispering
when we walk into a room.

197
00:14:40,608 --> 00:14:43,146
Face it, Chris.
To regular people...

198
00:14:43,236 --> 00:14:46,071
we're stone fucking goombahs,
you know?

199
00:14:46,155 --> 00:14:49,774
But to knockaround guys,
to our fathers...

200
00:14:49,867 --> 00:14:54,245
we're nothin'
but a couple of errand boys.

201
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:58,198
Shit. Sometimes l think
l ought to change my name.

202
00:14:58,293 --> 00:15:03,334
No, l need the name.
Gets me laid once a week...

203
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:05,546
at least.

204
00:15:25,027 --> 00:15:27,981
- Hey, Johnny Marbles.
- Matty.

205
00:15:28,072 --> 00:15:29,151
- Scarpa.
- What's up?

206
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,149
Almost bent my plane
on this Jet up there.

207
00:15:31,242 --> 00:15:34,492
Just dodged a goddamn Aer Lingus
air bus. Irish bastards!

208
00:15:34,579 --> 00:15:37,248
Why don't you stop flyin'
this bottom feeder...

209
00:15:37,331 --> 00:15:39,407
upgrade your pilot's rating
to Jets?

210
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,576
Sign me up.
Fly all over the world...

211
00:15:41,669 --> 00:15:44,041
work in a stewardess-rich
environment.

212
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:46,087
What l really need
is a shot with your father.

213
00:15:46,174 --> 00:15:48,131
I'm serious. Would you
talk to him for me?

214
00:15:48,217 --> 00:15:50,210
Tell him it's been a year since
anything's been up my nose.

215
00:15:51,554 --> 00:15:55,172
OIK, ten months, but l'm ready.
I'm locked down.

216
00:15:56,726 --> 00:16:00,059
- You ready to go, or what?
- Yeah. Where's Taylor?

217
00:17:03,709 --> 00:17:06,165
I got nothing for you,
my friend.

218
00:17:10,132 --> 00:17:12,504
I checked the meter
on my machines.

219
00:17:12,593 --> 00:17:14,336
Now, they've had plenty of play.

220
00:17:14,428 --> 00:17:16,753
I gave you that key
so you could borrow a little...

221
00:17:16,847 --> 00:17:19,517
float yourself for a few days.

222
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,051
But half that money is mine,
and l want it.

223
00:17:23,145 --> 00:17:25,470
What can l tell you, Taylor?
l run a business here.

224
00:17:25,564 --> 00:17:26,762
I have expenses.

225
00:17:26,857 --> 00:17:31,151
If l'm not paying fast enough
for you, turn 'em off.

226
00:17:31,237 --> 00:17:33,110
Take them out of the store.

227
00:17:57,179 --> 00:18:00,382
What the fuck are you doing?
Are you crazy?

228
00:18:00,474 --> 00:18:02,431
They're your own
fucking machines!

229
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:08,721
Don't do this to me, por favor.

230
00:18:13,237 --> 00:18:15,028
The milk guy's getting paid...

231
00:18:15,114 --> 00:18:16,774
the potato chip guy's
getting paid...

232
00:18:16,865 --> 00:18:18,146
the beer guy's getting paid...

233
00:18:18,242 --> 00:18:20,151
every-fucking-body's
getting paid...

234
00:18:20,244 --> 00:18:23,198
and you look through me?!
You fuck!

235
00:18:24,373 --> 00:18:26,412
I got it, l got it.
It's right here.

236
00:18:35,801 --> 00:18:38,043
Hey, Teddy. Good to see you.

237
00:18:38,137 --> 00:18:40,046
Hey, Deserve, we were
Just talking about you.

238
00:18:42,016 --> 00:18:46,179
Look at him. Teddy Deserve.

239
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:48,725
Guy gets kissed more
than a mezuzah.

240
00:18:55,779 --> 00:18:57,736
I'll see you later.

241
00:18:57,823 --> 00:19:01,192
One day, Taylor, you're gonna be
walking in here with Teddy.

242
00:19:01,285 --> 00:19:04,570
Nah. He'll use me
when it suits him...

243
00:19:04,663 --> 00:19:07,154
and he knows l'll do the work.

244
00:19:07,249 --> 00:19:10,001
But l don't get
carried away with it.

245
00:19:10,085 --> 00:19:14,546
My mother's a Jew, and you know
what that means to them.

246
00:19:14,631 --> 00:19:18,214
I saw your bit
on the handball court...

247
00:19:18,302 --> 00:19:21,137
you know,
talking about being ready.

248
00:19:21,221 --> 00:19:24,471
- You meant that shit, right?
- Yeah.

249
00:19:24,558 --> 00:19:27,179
'Cause we've been down
this road before, Matty.

250
00:19:27,269 --> 00:19:29,511
I was twelve years old, Teddy.

251
00:19:29,605 --> 00:19:31,811
How long are you going to keep
holding that against me, huh?

252
00:19:31,899 --> 00:19:35,149
Time to move past it.
You think so?

253
00:19:35,235 --> 00:19:38,153
- Fucking-A.
- So do l.

254
00:19:38,238 --> 00:19:40,314
And l told your father that.

255
00:19:40,407 --> 00:19:42,649
You did?

256
00:19:45,996 --> 00:19:50,124
Remember the problem
we were talking about?

257
00:19:50,209 --> 00:19:51,537
- Shortages?
- Right.

258
00:19:51,627 --> 00:19:53,750
Georgie Yarkus out in Spokane...

259
00:19:53,837 --> 00:19:56,293
is floating your father
some wood for a short term.

260
00:19:56,381 --> 00:19:59,169
Got to go get it,
but we got nobody we can trust.

261
00:19:59,259 --> 00:20:01,168
We're still hashing out
the details...

262
00:20:01,261 --> 00:20:05,010
- but you could be involved.
- Yeah?

263
00:20:05,098 --> 00:20:09,559
I done what l could, Matty.
It's on you to convince him.

264
00:20:11,188 --> 00:20:14,058
I'll see you later at the hall.

265
00:20:40,801 --> 00:20:43,292
Hey, look alive.

266
00:20:43,387 --> 00:20:45,593
- Evening, Matty.
- How you doing, man?

267
00:20:56,566 --> 00:20:58,524
Sounding good, Jimmy.
How you doing?

268
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:00,069
Hey, what's up, Matty?

269
00:21:00,153 --> 00:21:04,198
- Hey, how you doing, Joe?
- Hey, paying customers, Matty.

270
00:21:11,957 --> 00:21:13,367
- Hey, Vito.
- Hey, Matty.

271
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:15,451
- How you doing?
- Good.

272
00:21:15,544 --> 00:21:17,951
Pump it out, gentlemen.
Get your rent.

273
00:21:18,046 --> 00:21:21,130
There it is!
Come on, sweetheart!

274
00:21:21,216 --> 00:21:25,130
- Hey, Matty!
- Fellas. Hey.

275
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:27,509
Did you have a visit
from Tuxedo-Max?

276
00:21:27,597 --> 00:21:30,171
That's right.
Help yourself to a cummerbund.

277
00:21:33,019 --> 00:21:34,763
Twenty up! Twenty up!

278
00:21:34,855 --> 00:21:37,227
Come on.
Billy's babes need the bread.

279
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:44,525
You need this money picked up
from Yarkus in Spokane?

280
00:21:44,614 --> 00:21:46,322
I'm your guy.

281
00:21:46,408 --> 00:21:49,741
The answer's no.

282
00:21:49,828 --> 00:21:53,742
You get detected crossing state
lines with all that lumber...

283
00:21:53,832 --> 00:21:57,532
feds trace you back to me,
l'm fucked here.

284
00:21:57,627 --> 00:22:01,292
Listen, l can get this
done for you...

285
00:22:01,381 --> 00:22:04,298
'cause Marbles has got a plane.
He can fly out and pick it up.

286
00:22:04,384 --> 00:22:09,627
Better that way. Besides,
it's a simple fuckin' run.

287
00:22:09,723 --> 00:22:12,261
Hold on. Marbles?

288
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:15,020
He's half an idiot,
and that is the good half.

289
00:22:15,103 --> 00:22:17,012
Come on. He's in, he's out.

290
00:22:17,105 --> 00:22:20,059
Pop, listen to me. I swear
to God, he's turned it around.

291
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:23,316
And l'll oversee
the whole thing.

292
00:22:23,403 --> 00:22:26,653
Would you give me this much?
l can get this Job done.

293
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:31,283
Matty, l hate to knife you here,
but it's my experience:

294
00:22:31,369 --> 00:22:35,663
a guy gets something done
because he needs to.

295
00:22:35,749 --> 00:22:37,706
Now, maybe it's my doing.

296
00:22:37,792 --> 00:22:41,660
The way l raised ya,
privilege and such...

297
00:22:41,755 --> 00:22:43,831
but l'm having a hard time
figuring out...

298
00:22:43,923 --> 00:22:46,165
what it is you need.

299
00:22:46,259 --> 00:22:49,710
Not for nothin',
but most guys go in for it...

300
00:22:49,804 --> 00:22:53,553
'cause they don't got
no other way to survive.

301
00:22:59,272 --> 00:23:01,181
Well, neither do l.

302
00:23:06,988 --> 00:23:09,906
Listen, l got us
an opportunity, Marbles.

303
00:23:09,991 --> 00:23:13,442
You need to fly to Spokane.
Felts Field.

304
00:23:13,536 --> 00:23:16,288
There'll be a guy there
named Georgie Yarkus.

305
00:23:16,372 --> 00:23:19,991
He'll hand you a bag.
Don't look in the bag...

306
00:23:20,084 --> 00:23:22,622
don't open the bag,
don't let go of the bag.

307
00:23:22,712 --> 00:23:25,084
Only stop for fuel,
then get back in the plane...

308
00:23:25,173 --> 00:23:31,341
and fly straight home to me.
And don't fuck this up.

309
00:23:31,429 --> 00:23:35,296
Benny Chains said to tell you,
"Don't fuck this up."

310
00:23:35,391 --> 00:23:37,301
I know, only stop for gas.
Don't worry.

311
00:23:37,393 --> 00:23:39,053
I keep her on the barber pole
the whole way back.

312
00:24:04,337 --> 00:24:06,211
Come on, stay alert.

313
00:24:20,728 --> 00:24:22,721
Well, Just one.

314
00:25:23,833 --> 00:25:26,288
- Have a good flight.
- Thank you very much.

315
00:25:26,377 --> 00:25:28,749
- Hi, Louise.
- Sheriff.

316
00:25:28,838 --> 00:25:31,839
- How are you doing, Louise?
- Good, Donnie.

317
00:25:36,429 --> 00:25:40,841
- Yeah.
- Say it again, Tease.

318
00:25:40,933 --> 00:25:44,385
If l had mad moochie,
do you know what l'd buy?

319
00:25:44,478 --> 00:25:46,305
I believe l do, Decker.

320
00:25:46,397 --> 00:25:49,314
Doctor Go-Fast design
pro-model street luge.

321
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,935
- Carbon-fibre front fender.
- With the vibe-absorb seat.

322
00:25:53,029 --> 00:25:56,813
- Yeah. Z-roller trucks.
- Fuckin' boss speed, man.

323
00:26:10,338 --> 00:26:12,295
Even hyper super-mondo wheels.

324
00:26:12,381 --> 00:26:14,872
Definitely
super-mondo wheels, man.

325
00:26:19,346 --> 00:26:22,182
That don't look
store-bought to me, Stan.

326
00:26:22,266 --> 00:26:23,891
Nope, it's mariJuana, Donnie.

327
00:26:25,978 --> 00:26:30,391
- Want to deal with it now?
- Best l deal with it later.

328
00:26:45,122 --> 00:26:48,871
Hey. Fifty-four gallons.
Just top her off.

329
00:27:27,957 --> 00:27:30,911
I swear to Christ, Matty.
I swear to fuckin' Christ.

330
00:27:31,001 --> 00:27:32,330
What did you do?

331
00:27:32,419 --> 00:27:35,420
I swear to Christ. I didn't
turn my back for a second.

332
00:27:35,506 --> 00:27:37,379
What are you saying to me, huh?

333
00:27:37,466 --> 00:27:41,416
I stopped to get fuel. I don't
leave the bag in the plane...

334
00:27:41,512 --> 00:27:44,347
I'll tell you that much.
But these cops--

335
00:27:44,431 --> 00:27:46,009
Cops? What cops?!

336
00:27:47,518 --> 00:27:49,594
They looked right through me.

337
00:27:49,687 --> 00:27:52,937
It was like they knew every
thing l'd ever been guilty of.

338
00:27:53,023 --> 00:27:54,932
I couldn't double back
to the plane.

339
00:27:55,025 --> 00:27:58,690
It would've seemed too obvious.
I had to make a decision:

340
00:27:58,779 --> 00:28:02,278
walk right into 'em,
expose your father...

341
00:28:02,366 --> 00:28:03,741
or stash the bag.

342
00:28:16,755 --> 00:28:19,507
A few of the boys
were going down the way to--

343
00:28:19,591 --> 00:28:21,002
What? l'm not invited?

344
00:28:21,093 --> 00:28:23,216
No, l'll talk to you about that,
but l Just wanted...

345
00:28:23,303 --> 00:28:25,973
to extend to you, you know,
an invitation, 'cause l--

346
00:28:26,056 --> 00:28:30,101
Fifty-four gallons
of 100 octane low-lead, please.

347
00:28:31,603 --> 00:28:35,103
That'll be 116. 10, sir.

348
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:37,860
- Credit or--
- Cash. I'll pay cash.

349
00:28:50,038 --> 00:28:52,114
You Just keep the difference.

350
00:28:52,207 --> 00:28:56,620
Don't be ridiculous, sir.
Let me open my strongbox here.

351
00:28:58,964 --> 00:29:02,499
- One moment.
- No, it's gonna take too long.

352
00:29:02,593 --> 00:29:04,253
Why are you in such a rush?

353
00:29:08,473 --> 00:29:10,929
I got a schedule.

354
00:29:20,402 --> 00:29:22,110
Hey, this one ain't tagged.

355
00:29:33,874 --> 00:29:36,246
- I have your change.
- No, really, it's OIK.

356
00:29:36,335 --> 00:29:39,454
Take your change, son!

357
00:29:49,056 --> 00:29:53,184
We don't see too many hundred
dollar bills around here.

358
00:29:53,268 --> 00:29:57,729
That's one-seventeen...

359
00:29:57,814 --> 00:30:01,598
eighteen, nineteen, twenty.

360
00:30:01,693 --> 00:30:03,816
Forty, sixty...

361
00:30:15,957 --> 00:30:17,997
Long as they keep
moving through.

362
00:30:18,084 --> 00:30:21,453
- Where's that flight headed?
- Last flight of the day.

363
00:30:21,546 --> 00:30:24,333
The only place they fly
is Billings.

364
00:30:46,696 --> 00:30:50,990
Listen to me! Who the fuck
has the money, Marbles?!

365
00:30:51,076 --> 00:30:54,279
Matty, l have no idea.

366
00:31:19,521 --> 00:31:23,601
That road is total bacon, dude!

367
00:31:23,692 --> 00:31:25,768
That was sick!

368
00:31:27,904 --> 00:31:32,281
Fuck. All right,
where the hell are you?

369
00:31:32,367 --> 00:31:35,072
Wibaux, Montana.

370
00:31:39,332 --> 00:31:40,874
W- e-e-b-o--

371
00:31:40,959 --> 00:31:43,201
No, W-i-b-a-u-x.

372
00:31:43,294 --> 00:31:46,331
- X?
- Yeah, X.

373
00:31:46,423 --> 00:31:48,961
What do you want me to do now?

374
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:54,293
Don't do anything, OIK?
We're coming out.

375
00:32:14,451 --> 00:32:16,277
What are you doing?

376
00:32:16,369 --> 00:32:18,658
What are you,
a fucking ballerina now?

377
00:32:18,746 --> 00:32:21,154
No, it's t'ai chi. First off...

378
00:32:21,249 --> 00:32:23,574
I'm refining my centre,
and it stretches you out.

379
00:32:23,668 --> 00:32:26,835
I'm all crimped up from sleeping
in the fucking plane.

380
00:32:26,921 --> 00:32:28,830
Plus, it's a deadly art.

381
00:32:30,216 --> 00:32:32,375
You're a fucking hard-on.

382
00:32:32,468 --> 00:32:35,469
That hurt.
I absorbed the impact, though.

383
00:32:35,555 --> 00:32:37,429
Shut up, all right?

384
00:32:37,515 --> 00:32:40,053
I go on the line for you.
I give you a shot. For what?

385
00:32:40,143 --> 00:32:43,097
Jeez, Matty, l told you,
there were cops.

386
00:32:43,187 --> 00:32:45,097
It felt like a set up.
What can l tell you?

387
00:32:45,189 --> 00:32:47,016
Look, l know l fucked the dog
on this one--

388
00:32:47,108 --> 00:32:50,892
No, you didn't Just
fuck the dog. You fucked me.

389
00:32:50,987 --> 00:32:54,937
Matty, l swear, all right?
lf l have to work...

390
00:32:55,033 --> 00:32:56,824
the rest of my life,
l'll pay you back.

391
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:58,285
Where was the last place
you saw it?

392
00:32:58,369 --> 00:32:59,780
Right here.

393
00:32:59,871 --> 00:33:02,706
You told me not to take
my eyes off it. I didn't.

394
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:04,450
I thought it went to Billings.
I was wrong.

395
00:33:04,542 --> 00:33:06,369
But l scoped every passenger.
Crew, too.

396
00:33:06,461 --> 00:33:09,912
I watched every piece
of baggage come off.

397
00:33:10,006 --> 00:33:12,461
It's got to be here somewhere.

398
00:33:18,514 --> 00:33:20,590
I'm coming with, right?

399
00:33:20,683 --> 00:33:22,723
Do what the fuck you want.

400
00:33:27,857 --> 00:33:29,766
My friend here
lost a bag yesterday...

401
00:33:29,859 --> 00:33:31,270
and l was wondering
if you'd be so kind--

402
00:33:31,361 --> 00:33:35,109
Hey, you find that bag yet?

403
00:33:35,198 --> 00:33:39,907
Like l said last evening,
l am the lost and found...

404
00:33:39,994 --> 00:33:42,034
and no bags have been turned in.

405
00:33:42,121 --> 00:33:45,288
Louise, l know this is gonna
sound irregular...

406
00:33:45,374 --> 00:33:47,284
but what was in that bag
was extremely important.

407
00:33:47,376 --> 00:33:50,247
What l need from you is a list
of arriving passengers...

408
00:33:50,338 --> 00:33:52,212
airport staff, home addresses...

409
00:33:52,298 --> 00:33:53,673
phone numbers,
this sort of thing.

410
00:33:53,758 --> 00:33:56,961
Sir, that is quite impossible.

411
00:33:57,053 --> 00:33:59,888
Well, l'm willing to pay.

412
00:33:59,972 --> 00:34:02,179
What l can do
is call the sheriff...

413
00:34:02,266 --> 00:34:04,306
and ask him to help you
with your search.

414
00:34:04,393 --> 00:34:06,185
No, that's all right.

415
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:09,271
Could you tell me
who l can rent a car from?

416
00:34:09,357 --> 00:34:12,856
You're talkin' to her.

417
00:34:34,507 --> 00:34:37,508
Look at this place.

418
00:34:37,593 --> 00:34:40,511
Guys like us could be
running it in a week.

419
00:34:40,596 --> 00:34:42,256
First thing you do
in an open town...

420
00:34:42,348 --> 00:34:44,008
is the control the cart-out.

421
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,769
I'd put my name on every garbage
truck running through here.

422
00:34:46,852 --> 00:34:50,850
Listen,
someone's got that money.

423
00:34:52,692 --> 00:34:58,196
My uncle, he says we got
to announce ourselves to them...

424
00:34:58,281 --> 00:35:00,688
make them want to find us.

425
00:35:02,952 --> 00:35:05,158
Make them beg us
to take that money back...

426
00:35:05,246 --> 00:35:08,412
they're so scared, so long as
we leave them the fuck alone.

427
00:35:10,418 --> 00:35:15,329
OIK, how do we do that?

428
00:35:18,259 --> 00:35:20,928
I don't know.

429
00:35:22,221 --> 00:35:25,471
Like this:

430
00:35:25,558 --> 00:35:29,009
we find the toughest guy here...

431
00:35:29,103 --> 00:35:32,602
I mean, the worst guy they got.

432
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:37,815
The guy all the other guys
cross the street to avoid...

433
00:35:37,903 --> 00:35:41,438
and we glaze this tough guy...

434
00:35:41,532 --> 00:35:45,031
give him
the beating of his life...

435
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:48,452
way past the worst
he's ever given.

436
00:35:57,882 --> 00:36:00,717
Looks like they're multiplying,
Donnie.

437
00:36:00,801 --> 00:36:02,794
Best we keep on our toes.

438
00:36:05,848 --> 00:36:08,006
Let me take care of this.

439
00:36:14,565 --> 00:36:17,103
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

440
00:36:17,193 --> 00:36:21,854
Listen, l need some information.
I want you to take this.

441
00:36:21,947 --> 00:36:26,325
I can't break that.
Your tab only came to 14.30.

442
00:36:28,287 --> 00:36:30,244
Look, dear, what's your name?

443
00:36:32,917 --> 00:36:34,494
Bernadette.

444
00:36:34,585 --> 00:36:38,036
Bernadette. You Just tell me
where l can find...

445
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:40,336
a little trouble in this town.

446
00:36:40,424 --> 00:36:43,259
Used to be you would have
already found it.

447
00:36:43,344 --> 00:36:46,713
But since l'm taken...

448
00:36:46,805 --> 00:36:50,885
you could always try
the Shamrock tonight.

449
00:37:13,916 --> 00:37:16,585
It's like a fucking
homecoming over there.

450
00:37:16,668 --> 00:37:17,949
Are you kidding me?

451
00:37:18,045 --> 00:37:21,212
They got action here, Matty.
Legal fucking action.

452
00:37:22,883 --> 00:37:25,800
Grab a table. I got the beers.

453
00:37:32,309 --> 00:37:34,551
Hi there.
Do you boys need anything?

454
00:37:34,645 --> 00:37:39,188
No, we're good...very good.

455
00:37:41,401 --> 00:37:45,269
Listen, l'm looking for the guy
who runs this place.

456
00:37:45,364 --> 00:37:47,273
Owner lives up at Mile City.

457
00:37:47,366 --> 00:37:51,446
No, no, l mean, you know,
the guy who runs the place.

458
00:37:54,915 --> 00:37:58,118
I'm the night manager.
You sellin' somethin'?

459
00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:01,709
Never mind. Just give me
three beers, would you?

460
00:38:03,423 --> 00:38:05,250
Seven-fifty.

461
00:38:05,342 --> 00:38:07,714
Here. IKeep it.

462
00:38:16,144 --> 00:38:17,342
Hey, Gordy.

463
00:38:22,818 --> 00:38:26,317
Howdy, sidewinder.
Take your best shot.

464
00:38:27,447 --> 00:38:30,235
Gotcha.

465
00:38:30,325 --> 00:38:33,611
Howdy, sidewinder.
Take your best--

466
00:38:33,704 --> 00:38:34,866
Got me.

467
00:38:34,955 --> 00:38:37,244
Howdy, sidewinder. Take--

468
00:38:37,332 --> 00:38:38,495
Got me.

469
00:38:38,583 --> 00:38:42,202
You see anybody in here
with an unusually thick roll?

470
00:38:44,047 --> 00:38:46,289
Nah. I've been watching.

471
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:51,716
Who the fuck
are Brooks and Dunn?

472
00:38:51,805 --> 00:38:55,850
They're real good, aren't they?
They're Teri's favourite.

473
00:38:55,934 --> 00:38:58,639
Hey, Teri, come here.

474
00:38:58,729 --> 00:39:02,062
How are you, dear?
People really dance to this?

475
00:39:02,149 --> 00:39:03,940
- Sure.
- Show me.

476
00:39:04,025 --> 00:39:06,267
- Show you?
- Yeah, come on.

477
00:39:06,361 --> 00:39:10,275
All right.
It's easier than easy.

478
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:19,240
Jesus Christ.

479
00:39:21,334 --> 00:39:23,457
You dance good.
Where are you from?

480
00:39:23,545 --> 00:39:25,205
Brooklyn.

481
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,257
Oh, great.

482
00:39:30,343 --> 00:39:32,965
These are nice guys here, Gordy.
We were Just dancin'.

483
00:39:34,097 --> 00:39:35,757
Why don't you keep to yourself?

484
00:39:44,065 --> 00:39:46,023
Well, you were askin' about me.

485
00:39:46,109 --> 00:39:49,027
You got my attention now,
don't ya?

486
00:39:49,112 --> 00:39:54,070
You run this place? You the man?
You the guy l come to...

487
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:55,986
if l wanted to sort
some things out?

488
00:39:56,077 --> 00:40:00,075
No, l'm Brucker. I'm the guy
askin' what the fuck you want.

489
00:40:00,165 --> 00:40:02,916
I am also the guy decides
if you and your friends...

490
00:40:03,001 --> 00:40:05,539
walk the fuck outta here or not!

491
00:40:07,172 --> 00:40:08,749
Yeah, he'll do.

492
00:40:16,139 --> 00:40:17,966
Five hundred.

493
00:40:19,392 --> 00:40:21,883
Five hundred what, douche bag?

494
00:40:30,987 --> 00:40:33,110
Five hundred fights.

495
00:40:33,198 --> 00:40:36,567
That's the number l figured
when l was a kid.

496
00:40:38,328 --> 00:40:40,202
Five hundred street fights...

497
00:40:40,288 --> 00:40:43,739
and you can consider yourself
a legitimate tough guy.

498
00:40:43,833 --> 00:40:50,547
You need 'em for experience,
to develop leather skin.

499
00:40:50,632 --> 00:40:54,843
So l got started.
Of course, along the way...

500
00:40:54,928 --> 00:40:58,012
you stop thinkin'
about being tough and all that.

501
00:40:58,098 --> 00:41:01,301
It stops bein' the point.

502
00:41:01,393 --> 00:41:04,726
Get past
the silliness of it all.

503
00:41:04,813 --> 00:41:07,220
But then...

504
00:41:10,944 --> 00:41:14,028
after...

505
00:41:14,114 --> 00:41:17,364
you realise that's what you are.

506
00:41:19,786 --> 00:41:22,193
Look, l got no problem
with you, all right?

507
00:41:22,288 --> 00:41:24,080
I'll tell you,
you learn a lotta things...

508
00:41:24,165 --> 00:41:29,123
on the way to five hundred,
none more important than this...

509
00:41:39,764 --> 00:41:42,006
Son of a bitch.

510
00:42:51,711 --> 00:42:54,083
Listen to me.

511
00:42:54,172 --> 00:42:58,086
Before we walked in here
this was your town, right?

512
00:42:58,176 --> 00:43:00,749
Well, this is how
you get it back.

513
00:43:00,845 --> 00:43:03,170
Something of ours went missing.

514
00:43:03,264 --> 00:43:05,969
Whoever took it has gotta be
making it obvious...

515
00:43:06,058 --> 00:43:08,596
so l want you to find out who.

516
00:43:08,686 --> 00:43:13,099
When you do,
you come meet me at the motel.

517
00:43:33,169 --> 00:43:35,126
Do you really think
whoever's got the money...

518
00:43:35,213 --> 00:43:38,498
would be stupid enough
to Just geek around with it?

519
00:43:38,591 --> 00:43:40,630
Cool.

520
00:43:45,973 --> 00:43:48,013
- Chocodiles?
- Oh, yeah.

521
00:43:50,019 --> 00:43:51,846
That it?

522
00:43:54,148 --> 00:43:56,639
Where do you keep
your Cocoa Puffs?

523
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:07,651
Get that, will ya, Teddy?

524
00:44:07,745 --> 00:44:10,414
- Yeah?
- Hey, Teddy. It's me.

525
00:44:10,498 --> 00:44:14,578
It's you? lt's Matty.
Where the fuck have you been?

526
00:44:14,669 --> 00:44:17,539
I'm with Marbles. I'm trying
to take care of this thing.

527
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:20,121
But l figure it's pretty
much under control now.

528
00:44:20,216 --> 00:44:22,754
Don't piss down my back
and tell me it's raining.

529
00:44:22,843 --> 00:44:25,085
You tell me
what's really going on here.

530
00:44:25,179 --> 00:44:29,841
Hey, Pop, listen. I've had
a few complications, that's all.

531
00:44:29,934 --> 00:44:32,851
- Yeah, like what?
- Where are you exactly?

532
00:44:34,772 --> 00:44:38,057
- Look, l'll be home tomorrow.
- You'll be home?

533
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:40,688
I told you not
to fuckin' go anywhere.

534
00:44:40,778 --> 00:44:43,648
You got the bag with you
at least, right?

535
00:44:43,739 --> 00:44:46,574
Yeah. I'm going
to get it right now.

536
00:44:46,659 --> 00:44:48,070
You don't have the fuckin' bag?!

537
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,236
- Pop, listen--
- He begged me!

538
00:44:50,329 --> 00:44:51,492
It's under control,
l swear to you.

539
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:55,660
He begged me for this shot,
and you, you convinced me...

540
00:44:55,751 --> 00:44:57,791
to give it to him.

541
00:44:57,878 --> 00:44:59,787
Pop, would you listen to me?

542
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:02,205
I should have known
fuckin' better.

543
00:45:02,299 --> 00:45:03,462
Shit.

544
00:45:03,551 --> 00:45:06,884
Matty, that bag
is not full of nickels.

545
00:45:06,971 --> 00:45:09,259
It's got about
a half million dollars in it...

546
00:45:09,348 --> 00:45:11,506
and now your father
owes the guys above...

547
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:15,183
and Georgie fuckin' Yarkus.
If we don't get that bag back...

548
00:45:15,271 --> 00:45:19,103
in the next forty-eight hours,
it's the three Rs for us:

549
00:45:19,191 --> 00:45:22,228
the roof, the river,
or the revolver.

550
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:24,727
Get that fucking money.

551
00:45:24,822 --> 00:45:26,446
Yeah, l know. Teddy, listen...

552
00:45:26,532 --> 00:45:28,987
I've been trying
to deal with this--

553
00:45:29,952 --> 00:45:32,869
Fuck. Fuck!

554
00:45:41,964 --> 00:45:46,460
Clueless, do me a favour.
Call Santos over at the 504.

555
00:45:46,552 --> 00:45:49,506
- Air transport union?
- Yeah.

556
00:45:49,596 --> 00:45:52,847
We need a flight plan
and a tail number.

557
00:46:02,568 --> 00:46:05,438
Looks like more than the usual
Thursday night Macarena...

558
00:46:05,529 --> 00:46:08,863
- huh, Heslop?
- Yeah.

559
00:46:19,585 --> 00:46:22,076
Hey, Clute,
anybody been in here...

560
00:46:22,171 --> 00:46:24,792
spending
an unusual amount of cash?

561
00:46:24,882 --> 00:46:27,586
Yeah, these two little
skateboard punks.

562
00:46:27,676 --> 00:46:30,084
They wrecked
the beef Jerky display...

563
00:46:30,179 --> 00:46:32,385
stuff all over the floor.

564
00:46:51,492 --> 00:46:53,116
Hey, Gordy.

565
00:46:53,202 --> 00:46:55,953
That's a pretty fancy
new set-up you got there.

566
00:46:58,457 --> 00:47:01,244
Afraid l got some bad news
for you boys.

567
00:47:01,335 --> 00:47:03,956
IKinda like that scarrage
on your face--

568
00:47:04,046 --> 00:47:06,288
I ain't in the mood, Tease,
all right?

569
00:47:18,727 --> 00:47:23,056
Look at these fuckers.
Covered in camouflage...

570
00:47:23,148 --> 00:47:27,893
sitting out in the woods
all day, stakin' out a turkey.

571
00:47:30,948 --> 00:47:33,521
What do they need
to do that for?

572
00:47:33,617 --> 00:47:37,365
Go to fuckin' Graztiti's,
get a Butterball.

573
00:47:41,124 --> 00:47:43,117
You know, we were gonna go once.

574
00:47:45,087 --> 00:47:46,960
November 14, 1986.

575
00:47:47,047 --> 00:47:48,874
- Come on.
- Yeah.

576
00:47:50,676 --> 00:47:53,712
Just me and my pop,
goin' upstate for deer.

577
00:47:53,804 --> 00:47:59,972
I remember, l was gonna get
woken up at 4: 15 in the morning.

578
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:02,812
The knock came, all right.

579
00:48:02,896 --> 00:48:06,728
Whole fucking door
came off its hinges.

580
00:48:06,817 --> 00:48:09,652
OC task force, feds, NYPD.

581
00:48:11,279 --> 00:48:16,356
No. Didn't take any chances
with Benny Chains that night.

582
00:48:19,454 --> 00:48:23,286
You know, l always wondered
what it would have been like...

583
00:48:23,375 --> 00:48:26,127
if we had left
the night before, you know?

584
00:48:27,587 --> 00:48:32,961
At least have those couple days
together before he went in.

585
00:48:41,643 --> 00:48:43,351
Man, yes!

586
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:49,063
So this could've been you, huh?

587
00:48:51,653 --> 00:48:55,069
Yeah, the hat,
the face-net, the whole deal.

588
00:48:55,156 --> 00:48:58,027
A different way for me.
What can l tell you?

589
00:49:12,882 --> 00:49:15,634
I found out what you told me to.

590
00:49:45,123 --> 00:49:48,741
Hey, dude. You think
if we give 'em back the money...

591
00:49:48,835 --> 00:49:50,958
you think they'll let us go?

592
00:49:53,798 --> 00:49:55,957
I've been thinking, dude.

593
00:49:58,094 --> 00:49:59,339
You believe this?

594
00:50:01,806 --> 00:50:03,846
A couple of kids.

595
00:50:03,933 --> 00:50:06,092
Back home
you find a bag of dog shit...

596
00:50:06,186 --> 00:50:08,474
you go looking for
who it belongs to, right?

597
00:50:17,614 --> 00:50:20,069
- Donnie.
- Morning, Stan.

598
00:50:20,158 --> 00:50:24,369
- Back to the salt mines?
- Gotta make one stop first.

599
00:50:27,123 --> 00:50:28,867
All right, no, l see...

600
00:50:28,958 --> 00:50:33,038
it's a valid point
about splitting, dude.

601
00:50:33,129 --> 00:50:35,620
Could we not take
the luges with?

602
00:50:35,715 --> 00:50:38,586
No, man, they're too bulky.
We gotta sacrifice 'em.

603
00:50:38,676 --> 00:50:41,464
- But my stuff--
- Dude...

604
00:50:41,554 --> 00:50:43,547
we'll get you new stuff.

605
00:50:52,232 --> 00:50:53,477
Go time.

606
00:50:58,696 --> 00:51:00,855
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, shit.

607
00:51:04,744 --> 00:51:06,119
What the fuck is that?

608
00:51:08,164 --> 00:51:10,737
I knew you weren't sick,
you lying sack of shit.

609
00:51:10,833 --> 00:51:13,040
Fuck. Hey, Dad.

610
00:51:15,838 --> 00:51:18,045
Watch your mouth.

611
00:51:18,132 --> 00:51:20,802
- What's in the bag, son?
- I don't know, look.

612
00:51:22,011 --> 00:51:24,549
More of that reefer
l saw you smoking?

613
00:51:26,099 --> 00:51:27,379
Give me that!

614
00:51:28,685 --> 00:51:30,179
Fuck.

615
00:51:38,194 --> 00:51:40,103
Where'd you get this?

616
00:51:41,781 --> 00:51:44,354
Get in the house.
We're gonna talk about this.

617
00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:46,407
Get in the house.

618
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:54,909
We were rich once.

619
00:52:08,266 --> 00:52:11,302
Fuck!

620
00:52:14,063 --> 00:52:15,605
Son of a bitch.

621
00:52:23,114 --> 00:52:26,068
So, what do you think, Stan?
Wanna bring in the hypos...

622
00:52:26,159 --> 00:52:30,405
or call straight to the federal
bureau about the money?

623
00:52:31,956 --> 00:52:35,123
What l think is,
we work pretty darn hard, Don.

624
00:52:35,209 --> 00:52:39,289
Pretty darn hard.

625
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:41,207
That we do.

626
00:52:41,299 --> 00:52:44,632
And we work pretty cheap,
too, don't we?

627
00:52:49,223 --> 00:52:51,595
Stan?

628
00:52:51,684 --> 00:52:53,926
So, fifty-fifty clean.

629
00:52:54,020 --> 00:53:01,932
247 for you, 247. 5 for me.
That's sheriff tax.

630
00:53:04,697 --> 00:53:09,074
You know what, Stan?
Why don't you keep it all?

631
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:11,152
I'm more than
a little uncomfortable here.

632
00:53:11,245 --> 00:53:15,824
Your comfort
concerns me not a hitch.

633
00:53:17,752 --> 00:53:21,370
You're keeping your half
'cause you're in it with me.

634
00:53:23,299 --> 00:53:26,834
And we're partners, Donnie.

635
00:53:26,927 --> 00:53:29,465
Partners, OIK?

636
00:53:36,395 --> 00:53:39,230
It's one thing running around
here trying to track the bag...

637
00:53:39,315 --> 00:53:43,063
...but cops? That makes it
a different story for me.

638
00:53:43,152 --> 00:53:45,643
I'm not fuckin' around
with any cops.

639
00:53:45,738 --> 00:53:47,777
They start asking
where the cash came from...

640
00:53:47,865 --> 00:53:50,356
- how we gonna answer that?
- He's right.

641
00:53:50,451 --> 00:53:54,912
Well, l gotta do something.
'Cause in helping you...

642
00:53:54,997 --> 00:53:56,906
I might have killed my old man.

643
00:53:56,999 --> 00:54:00,617
How the fuck do you figure that?
All right, l lost the bag...

644
00:54:00,711 --> 00:54:02,289
but l ain't getting arrested
behind it.

645
00:54:02,379 --> 00:54:04,004
What good is that gonna do us?

646
00:54:04,089 --> 00:54:06,759
Arrested.
Can you believe this guy?

647
00:54:06,842 --> 00:54:08,751
That'd be the good news.

648
00:54:08,844 --> 00:54:11,514
That bag was like life support
for my father.

649
00:54:11,597 --> 00:54:14,302
He needed it yesterday.

650
00:54:35,204 --> 00:54:37,243
What can l do you for, boys?

651
00:54:37,331 --> 00:54:40,118
Well, l'd say about
a half a million, Sheriff.

652
00:54:40,209 --> 00:54:41,584
Is that so?

653
00:54:41,669 --> 00:54:45,749
See, my friends and l, we're
looking to get out of your town.

654
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:49,884
But before we do, there's
something we can't leave behind.

655
00:54:49,969 --> 00:54:52,008
This ain't the lost and found.

656
00:54:52,096 --> 00:54:55,262
People around here are real
careful with their property.

657
00:54:55,349 --> 00:54:58,136
You wouldn't wanna misplace
your cow or nothin'.

658
00:54:59,228 --> 00:55:03,060
You got some set of oysters
on you there, boy...

659
00:55:03,148 --> 00:55:05,686
walkin' in here like you belong.

660
00:55:08,445 --> 00:55:11,446
But be that as it may...

661
00:55:11,532 --> 00:55:14,201
you say you lost some money,
a high dollar amount.

662
00:55:14,284 --> 00:55:16,692
As a public servant, l'd like
to help you get it back.

663
00:55:20,082 --> 00:55:22,751
Why don't you tell me
what happened?

664
00:55:22,835 --> 00:55:27,046
Listen, why don't you and l Just
have a little word in private?

665
00:55:33,512 --> 00:55:35,386
Come on, son.

666
00:55:55,075 --> 00:55:57,032
You see,
where l come from, Sheriff...

667
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:00,986
there's what you call
the spirit of sharing.

668
00:56:01,081 --> 00:56:03,287
People help each other.

669
00:56:03,375 --> 00:56:05,118
But since l've been out here...

670
00:56:05,210 --> 00:56:07,666
I've picked up on
a real streak of independence.

671
00:56:07,754 --> 00:56:09,830
How's that?

672
00:56:09,923 --> 00:56:13,541
The way l see it, is you've
been watching my money for me...

673
00:56:13,635 --> 00:56:17,847
protecting it.
And l appreciate that. I do.

674
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:23,762
You and your partner have
an opportunity to profit here.

675
00:56:23,854 --> 00:56:26,559
You're driving mighty close
to the line now, Skip.

676
00:56:26,648 --> 00:56:28,974
Why don't you Just cut
the bullshit?

677
00:56:29,067 --> 00:56:31,819
Do you know who l am?

678
00:56:31,904 --> 00:56:34,026
Well, l could call Mary
down at the hotel...

679
00:56:34,114 --> 00:56:36,486
and have her read me
the registration.

680
00:56:36,575 --> 00:56:39,991
- Why don't you tell me?
- My name's Matty Demaret.

681
00:56:44,499 --> 00:56:47,417
Look, l don't normally
volunteer this much...

682
00:56:47,502 --> 00:56:49,875
but l'm gonna tell you
because it's important.

683
00:56:49,963 --> 00:56:52,419
I'm Benny Chains' son.

684
00:56:53,967 --> 00:56:56,339
Well, l don't know
no Benny the Chains...

685
00:56:56,428 --> 00:56:59,927
but let's Just say
there is this money--

686
00:57:00,015 --> 00:57:02,054
Look, l saw you take it
off the kids, all right?

687
00:57:02,142 --> 00:57:05,143
I know you fucking have it.
So what you and l have to do...

688
00:57:05,228 --> 00:57:08,182
is come to some sort
of understanding.

689
00:57:08,273 --> 00:57:10,432
All right.

690
00:57:10,525 --> 00:57:12,185
You understand this.

691
00:57:17,199 --> 00:57:19,950
Stand down! Stand down!

692
00:57:21,036 --> 00:57:22,660
Get back behind the counter.
Turn around.

693
00:57:26,750 --> 00:57:28,624
Turn around!

694
00:57:47,521 --> 00:57:49,928
IKeep it trained on him, Don.

695
00:58:03,078 --> 00:58:05,865
You had it coming,
you son of a bitch.

696
00:58:05,956 --> 00:58:09,740
Guy you arse-whupped in that bar
is a cousin of mine.

697
00:58:10,877 --> 00:58:14,626
By marriage. Get him up!

698
00:58:25,141 --> 00:58:28,427
Forget this shit, Marbles.
Straight to the airport.

699
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:30,892
Abso-fucking-lutely, man.
We oughta chalk this one up...

700
00:58:30,981 --> 00:58:34,396
in the loss column
and Just move on.

701
00:58:34,484 --> 00:58:38,482
Move on? Look at him!

702
00:58:38,571 --> 00:58:40,066
What are you gonna do?

703
00:58:43,743 --> 00:58:46,234
You're gonna kill
a couple of cops?

704
00:58:46,329 --> 00:58:48,037
Pull over.

705
00:58:48,123 --> 00:58:50,744
Marbles, pull over!

706
00:58:50,834 --> 00:58:54,250
Matty,
what if they call the feds?

707
00:58:54,337 --> 00:58:57,374
Look, if that sheriff
was gonna call the FBl...

708
00:58:57,465 --> 00:59:00,300
or anybody else,
he would've already.

709
00:59:00,385 --> 00:59:03,588
Taylor's P.O.
would've been pulled.

710
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:06,385
That whole fucking motel
would've been swarming with law.

711
00:59:06,474 --> 00:59:08,052
They would've
taken us into custody...

712
00:59:08,143 --> 00:59:11,097
the minute
we walked into that station.

713
00:59:11,187 --> 00:59:12,432
They don't want us
in the system...

714
00:59:12,522 --> 00:59:14,978
because they don't want anybody
else knowin' about the money.

715
00:59:15,066 --> 00:59:19,858
- What are you talking about?
- They're keeping the money.

716
00:59:24,075 --> 00:59:30,742
Look, you two can leave
if you want to.

717
00:59:34,085 --> 00:59:36,493
But l ain't goin' anywhere.

718
01:00:00,361 --> 01:00:02,650
Scarpa. Goddamn,
l've heard that name.

719
01:00:02,739 --> 01:00:04,648
Yeah, well, Bill IKurtis
was talking about him...

720
01:00:04,741 --> 01:00:06,817
on the history
of organised crime on A&E.

721
01:00:07,994 --> 01:00:12,323
- You get A&E with satellite?
- Yeah.

722
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:14,158
You think that's his kid?

723
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:16,741
Oh, yeah, l surely do.

724
01:00:19,297 --> 01:00:21,206
You know something else, Don?

725
01:00:21,299 --> 01:00:24,169
That Demaret kid
wasn't Just Jaw-wagging.

726
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:26,087
His daddy Benny Demaret...

727
01:00:26,179 --> 01:00:28,421
seems like he's Just under
the top guys.

728
01:00:28,514 --> 01:00:31,468
Holy shit, Stan. An underboss?

729
01:00:34,312 --> 01:00:36,554
Look, we're not
rousting Juvies here.

730
01:00:36,648 --> 01:00:38,770
They're not Just gonna
let this go, that kind of money.

731
01:00:38,858 --> 01:00:40,732
They're gonna call their uncles
and their fathers...

732
01:00:40,818 --> 01:00:42,360
and they're gonna come here
looking for the money.

733
01:00:42,445 --> 01:00:44,153
The place
is gonna be crawling with 'em.

734
01:00:44,238 --> 01:00:47,654
You're watching too darn much
of that satellite, Donnie.

735
01:00:50,078 --> 01:00:51,821
Nobody's comin'
to this marine's town...

736
01:00:51,913 --> 01:00:54,155
and doing a damn thing.

737
01:00:54,248 --> 01:00:57,036
Just think about it.
They can't Just call...

738
01:00:57,126 --> 01:00:59,498
and say they lost the money.
They'd have done it already.

739
01:00:59,587 --> 01:01:02,292
They do that, they end up
in a barrel of acid...

740
01:01:02,381 --> 01:01:04,837
or whatever else they do
with their bodies these days.

741
01:01:04,926 --> 01:01:06,088
I see what you're saying.

742
01:01:06,177 --> 01:01:08,383
I Just don't figure on them
leaving empty-handed.

743
01:01:12,183 --> 01:01:16,311
See, that's the thing.
We can't let 'em leave.

744
01:01:25,071 --> 01:01:28,274
I'll tell you one thing,
next time l see those fucks...

745
01:01:28,366 --> 01:01:30,524
I'm gonna be packin'.

746
01:01:30,618 --> 01:01:33,191
I keep a piece in my plane.

747
01:02:02,608 --> 01:02:04,815
I'm sorry, Johnny.

748
01:02:12,118 --> 01:02:15,487
That is a big Heartland Lodge
buck right there.

749
01:02:15,579 --> 01:02:16,908
Feature this.

750
01:02:16,998 --> 01:02:20,865
State senate thinks they can
tell me how to run my shop.

751
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:24,329
So, yeah, there is
a three-day waiting period...

752
01:02:24,422 --> 01:02:27,126
technically.
But that's mostly enforceable...

753
01:02:27,216 --> 01:02:30,667
for your garden variety
Latino stick-up men...

754
01:02:30,761 --> 01:02:34,261
which you boys
don't appear to be.

755
01:02:34,348 --> 01:02:36,637
No, sir. Definitely not.

756
01:02:36,726 --> 01:02:40,177
Listen, l appreciate
you moving this along for us.

757
01:02:40,271 --> 01:02:42,678
Here's a bill
for all your trouble.

758
01:02:57,705 --> 01:02:59,662
They trouble? l thought
they would be trouble.

759
01:02:59,749 --> 01:03:01,871
No. No. No trouble.
Ouestion 'em, mostly.

760
01:03:01,959 --> 01:03:03,418
Just question 'em.

761
01:03:03,502 --> 01:03:06,669
Just wanna
yoggle-doggle with 'em.

762
01:03:06,755 --> 01:03:09,626
You give me a call
if you see 'em.

763
01:03:09,717 --> 01:03:11,674
You sure nobody from out of town
has been here?

764
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:14,880
No. Oh, out of town.

765
01:03:14,972 --> 01:03:17,261
Yeah, John Heater
come up from Beach.

766
01:03:17,349 --> 01:03:19,472
Had a party goin' huntin'
up Big Timber.

767
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:23,474
- No strangers?
- No stranger than you.

768
01:04:01,685 --> 01:04:05,101
- I gotta say this one time.
- What's that?

769
01:04:07,608 --> 01:04:09,067
You and Scarpa
take the car and drive.

770
01:04:09,151 --> 01:04:12,235
Leave me here with Marbles.
It's his fault anyway.

771
01:04:12,321 --> 01:04:16,484
Are you serious?
No, there's no way.

772
01:04:16,575 --> 01:04:19,362
It's not even a choice.

773
01:04:19,453 --> 01:04:23,036
Matty, l'm not Just talking
about this little field trip.

774
01:04:23,123 --> 01:04:25,994
I'm talking about all of it.

775
01:04:28,879 --> 01:04:31,500
You had it right
in the first place.

776
01:04:31,590 --> 01:04:35,374
Looking for a regular Job,
being a citizen.

777
01:04:35,469 --> 01:04:38,174
I tried it, man.

778
01:04:40,140 --> 01:04:42,548
It's the only thing left now.

779
01:04:42,643 --> 01:04:44,849
You don't want a piece of this.

780
01:04:46,605 --> 01:04:49,178
Matty, for ninety-nine guys
out of a hundred...

781
01:04:49,274 --> 01:04:53,023
this is lose-lose.

782
01:04:53,112 --> 01:04:56,527
It's not like the way
it was thirty years ago.

783
01:04:56,615 --> 01:04:58,572
It's not like the stories
your uncle was telling us...

784
01:04:58,659 --> 01:05:00,117
when we were growing up.

785
01:05:00,202 --> 01:05:04,663
Now it's either a bullet
in the back of your head...

786
01:05:04,748 --> 01:05:07,239
or Jail for life.

787
01:05:13,090 --> 01:05:14,833
Just snap it back in there.

788
01:05:26,728 --> 01:05:30,512
So you know all this, but l
don't see you trying to get out.

789
01:05:30,607 --> 01:05:35,850
I said you. Come on,
we're talking about you, here.

790
01:05:49,251 --> 01:05:52,916
Sorry l got you into this,
Taylor.

791
01:05:53,005 --> 01:05:55,211
It's Just more
of the same for me.

792
01:05:55,299 --> 01:05:59,082
Just more of the same.

793
01:06:36,715 --> 01:06:40,665
You fellas are on a real
busman's holiday, aren't ya?

794
01:06:40,761 --> 01:06:42,171
Hey, look at you.

795
01:06:42,262 --> 01:06:46,473
You roll into town with
more guys than Sinatra, right?

796
01:06:48,185 --> 01:06:50,308
Teddy, l Just want you to know
how truly sorry l am.

797
01:06:50,395 --> 01:06:52,139
I know l fucked this up
right from the get...

798
01:06:52,230 --> 01:06:54,472
but l'm gonna do everything
l can to make it right.

799
01:06:55,984 --> 01:06:59,151
Marbles, that voice
is cutting right through me.

800
01:06:59,237 --> 01:07:02,606
You are unlikable.
If it wasn't for Matty...

801
01:07:02,699 --> 01:07:04,905
I'd love to kill you right now.

802
01:07:04,993 --> 01:07:08,409
As it is, l'd like to kick you
through the uprights...

803
01:07:08,496 --> 01:07:11,070
Iike a fuckin' field goal.

804
01:07:14,669 --> 01:07:17,077
So, where are we at?

805
01:07:21,051 --> 01:07:23,090
We've had a wrinkle.

806
01:07:29,517 --> 01:07:33,183
- Cops are involved.
- Dirty fuckin' cops.

807
01:07:33,271 --> 01:07:37,139
Yeah, he said cops.
They give you that makeover?

808
01:07:39,027 --> 01:07:42,610
They do nice work.

809
01:07:42,697 --> 01:07:45,449
- You want to talk inside?
- No. We're not gonna talk here.

810
01:07:45,533 --> 01:07:49,033
We'll go over the state line
into North Dakota.

811
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:53,118
If anybody's lookin', we don't
want 'em to find us yet.

812
01:07:54,459 --> 01:07:56,831
Sheriff Decker's a lifer.

813
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:59,043
Came from the military,
highly decorated.

814
01:07:59,130 --> 01:08:03,757
Been in office eighteen years.
The man controls the town.

815
01:08:03,843 --> 01:08:05,836
Good. A man
used to running things...

816
01:08:05,929 --> 01:08:08,005
gonna think he can run us, too.

817
01:08:10,850 --> 01:08:15,346
Marbles, pay the check.

818
01:08:15,438 --> 01:08:17,230
Matty, you ride with me.

819
01:08:31,996 --> 01:08:33,455
I gotta ask you something.

820
01:08:33,540 --> 01:08:35,616
None of my guys
would even be here...

821
01:08:35,708 --> 01:08:38,246
if they weren't trying
to help me out.

822
01:08:38,336 --> 01:08:41,041
They shouldn't suffer for that,
you know?

823
01:08:41,131 --> 01:08:43,337
If we get that money back...

824
01:08:43,424 --> 01:08:45,298
nothin' happens to Marbles,
all right?

825
01:08:47,095 --> 01:08:49,337
Used to be there was a way
to do things...

826
01:08:49,430 --> 01:08:50,593
and things got done.

827
01:08:50,682 --> 01:08:53,469
No room for whining,
no room for mistakes.

828
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:57,771
Now, everybody's feelings
are involved.

829
01:08:57,856 --> 01:09:01,022
A guy steps wrong now, he ends
up on the witness stand...

830
01:09:01,109 --> 01:09:04,063
or on the fuckin'
Barbara Walters.

831
01:09:07,657 --> 01:09:10,943
But l'll tell you what, Matty.
Since you're askin'...

832
01:09:11,035 --> 01:09:13,609
I'll give you a one-time-only.

833
01:09:13,705 --> 01:09:18,663
Nothing will happen
to your friend. OIK?

834
01:09:21,963 --> 01:09:23,208
Thanks.

835
01:09:25,466 --> 01:09:29,049
You know, this whole thing's
my fault, anyway.

836
01:09:29,137 --> 01:09:32,553
I figured
l wasn't a kid anymore.

837
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:36,887
- I figured l was ready for this.
- Age got nothin' to do with it.

838
01:09:36,978 --> 01:09:39,101
You take Taylor,
you put him in that basement...

839
01:09:39,188 --> 01:09:42,024
it don't matter if he's
a toddler or 103 years old.

840
01:09:42,108 --> 01:09:46,604
He's gonna pull that trigger,
and you're not...

841
01:09:46,696 --> 01:09:48,819
'cause you're not made that way.

842
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:58,616
And that's good, OIK?
Don't get down on yourself...

843
01:09:58,708 --> 01:10:00,914
and the sheriff
will surface soon.

844
01:10:01,002 --> 01:10:02,876
We'll sort the thing out.

845
01:10:14,265 --> 01:10:15,843
You might want to notch it
back there a notch.

846
01:10:15,933 --> 01:10:17,178
We got work tonight.

847
01:10:19,687 --> 01:10:22,095
I don't know, man.
I'm not feelin' ready.

848
01:10:29,071 --> 01:10:33,650
We ran a check. We know
who you are, Mr. Demaret.

849
01:10:33,743 --> 01:10:35,700
We're willing to deal.

850
01:10:35,786 --> 01:10:38,028
Don't want guys like you
unhappy.

851
01:10:38,122 --> 01:10:40,957
Good.
So let's get this done, then.

852
01:10:41,042 --> 01:10:43,248
I'll come down.

853
01:10:43,336 --> 01:10:45,874
No, l don't want you
walking into my station again.

854
01:10:45,963 --> 01:10:49,213
We meet tonight.
I'm off duty at twelve.

855
01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:51,458
Brickman's Meats.
It's past the tracks.

856
01:10:51,552 --> 01:10:55,052
- So why not now?
- I'll say when.

857
01:10:55,139 --> 01:10:57,298
Bring your friends
if you're worried.

858
01:10:57,391 --> 01:10:59,265
I'll tell you what.
I don't like the sound of this.

859
01:10:59,352 --> 01:11:01,344
If you want to see
your money again...

860
01:11:01,437 --> 01:11:03,809
that's where it's gonna be.

861
01:11:06,150 --> 01:11:07,977
You're not talkin' about
leavin' are ya?

862
01:11:08,069 --> 01:11:09,646
I am.

863
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:14,032
I think you should
come with me, cuz.

864
01:11:14,116 --> 01:11:15,990
Matty needs us.

865
01:11:16,077 --> 01:11:18,912
Matty's got
all the backup he needs.

866
01:11:18,996 --> 01:11:21,997
Bus rolls by the interstate
and goes to Billings at 11: 15.

867
01:11:22,083 --> 01:11:24,159
I booked us a room
at the Sheraton...

868
01:11:24,251 --> 01:11:25,959
back in New York
by tomorrow morning.

869
01:11:26,045 --> 01:11:28,002
My father works things out
with Benny Chains...

870
01:11:28,089 --> 01:11:31,505
six months from now,
nobody's gonna remember a thing.

871
01:11:35,721 --> 01:11:38,426
No chance. No fuckin' way.

872
01:11:38,516 --> 01:11:40,307
You're my first cousin...

873
01:11:40,393 --> 01:11:43,062
and l have
a responsibility to you.

874
01:11:43,145 --> 01:11:49,231
This whole thing is my fault.
It's my doing and l'm sticking.

875
01:11:51,487 --> 01:11:53,978
If you gotta go, you go.

876
01:12:16,095 --> 01:12:19,879
All right, let's go in and see
how we set this thing up.

877
01:12:22,059 --> 01:12:23,304
That makes it twenty.

878
01:12:28,774 --> 01:12:30,933
- How about a check?
- I go to cash it...

879
01:12:31,026 --> 01:12:33,268
you cancel it the minute
l walk out of town? Nah.

880
01:12:33,362 --> 01:12:36,031
- Borrow it from your friend.
- Hey...

881
01:12:36,115 --> 01:12:39,281
Mr. New York mile-a-minute,
why don't you shut your mouth?

882
01:12:39,368 --> 01:12:42,239
You're makin' my ears hurt.

883
01:12:42,329 --> 01:12:44,037
That'll be enough of that,
fellas.

884
01:12:44,123 --> 01:12:48,251
- Go on and have a drink.
- Ain't none of your business.

885
01:12:53,507 --> 01:12:56,591
You don't want me
to make it my business, huh?

886
01:13:00,055 --> 01:13:01,550
Believe me.

887
01:13:03,767 --> 01:13:05,048
Come on.

888
01:13:16,363 --> 01:13:18,356
Can you imagine
these hillbilly bastards...

889
01:13:18,449 --> 01:13:19,777
tryin' to be tough guys?

890
01:13:19,867 --> 01:13:23,816
Fuckin' great. Great to see
you guys throwin' in like that.

891
01:13:23,912 --> 01:13:26,071
I mean, l didn't expect
to see you so early.

892
01:13:26,165 --> 01:13:27,825
I thought we were
gonna meet later...

893
01:13:27,916 --> 01:13:31,202
but still, you guys were
like the goddamn cavalry.

894
01:13:31,295 --> 01:13:32,837
Where's Scarpa?

895
01:13:32,921 --> 01:13:35,210
He stepped out.
Why? What's goin' on?

896
01:13:40,763 --> 01:13:42,387
Where's your fucking cousin?

897
01:13:42,473 --> 01:13:45,343
Wait. Matty said
nothing would happen to me.

898
01:13:47,311 --> 01:13:50,644
- Check with Teddy.
- Who do you think sent us?

899
01:13:55,944 --> 01:13:59,278
Come on. Where's Scarpa?

900
01:13:59,364 --> 01:14:00,645
I don't know.

901
01:14:00,741 --> 01:14:03,030
This is no time
for bean shootin'.

902
01:14:05,329 --> 01:14:09,658
- Maybe he's at the hotel?
- We were at the hotel, Marbles.

903
01:14:17,883 --> 01:14:23,387
Well, then, l don't know
where the fuck he is.

904
01:14:33,523 --> 01:14:35,931
Well, l guess
it's Just you, then.

905
01:15:32,165 --> 01:15:35,451
Believe this?

906
01:15:35,544 --> 01:15:37,536
It's almost time.

907
01:15:37,629 --> 01:15:41,330
I'm telling you, Marbles
and Scarpa are bailin' on us.

908
01:15:41,425 --> 01:15:44,710
That's about the only thing
you can count on in this life.

909
01:15:48,056 --> 01:15:53,014
There's nobody wouldn't hurt you
if it helped them.

910
01:15:53,103 --> 01:15:55,060
Yeah, well, l know that now.

911
01:15:56,857 --> 01:16:00,308
You ready? Let's go.

912
01:17:28,198 --> 01:17:30,356
Shouldn't be long now, Donnie.

913
01:17:48,384 --> 01:17:51,255
We Just walk right into it.

914
01:17:51,346 --> 01:17:53,469
IKeep this guy talkin',
all right?

915
01:17:55,433 --> 01:17:59,846
Turn off the part of your brain
that thinks. Just react.

916
01:17:59,938 --> 01:18:02,476
It's gonna be a lot louder
than you can fuckin' believe...

917
01:18:02,565 --> 01:18:04,641
and you might not hit a thing.

918
01:18:18,623 --> 01:18:23,000
Come on. Over there.

919
01:18:27,674 --> 01:18:30,081
So, where are
the other two clowns?

920
01:18:30,176 --> 01:18:32,667
Where the fuck is my money?

921
01:18:32,762 --> 01:18:35,134
No, we want to see
the other two.

922
01:18:37,225 --> 01:18:40,095
Come to think of it,
we can find them later.

923
01:18:40,186 --> 01:18:43,436
Slow down, Farmer Brown.

924
01:18:43,523 --> 01:18:46,192
Jim, don't point
a fucking gun at me.

925
01:18:46,275 --> 01:18:48,849
- Fuck! l knew it!
- Shut up.

926
01:18:51,489 --> 01:18:54,739
I know you thought this was
a manageable situation...

927
01:18:54,826 --> 01:18:57,198
but some situations
are unmanageable.

928
01:18:57,286 --> 01:19:00,453
Now, is a dumb shit like you...

929
01:19:00,540 --> 01:19:03,031
at least smart enough
to bring the money?

930
01:19:19,976 --> 01:19:22,218
Hey, arsehole!

931
01:19:22,311 --> 01:19:24,351
Put 'em down.

932
01:19:26,065 --> 01:19:29,434
Put the guns down!

933
01:19:30,570 --> 01:19:32,479
What the fuck is he doin' here?

934
01:19:34,115 --> 01:19:36,321
Well, it's like this, Don.

935
01:19:36,409 --> 01:19:38,485
There's a lot of money
in the bag.

936
01:19:40,621 --> 01:19:41,950
Holy shit!

937
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:45,710
- Chris.
- Holy shit.

938
01:19:45,793 --> 01:19:49,328
- I thought you'd left us.
- No, l had to come back.

939
01:19:55,428 --> 01:19:57,420
Where's Marbles?

940
01:19:57,513 --> 01:19:59,257
What?
l thought he left with you.

941
01:19:59,348 --> 01:20:01,637
No.
He said he wouldn't leave.

942
01:21:02,620 --> 01:21:05,027
Let's see what we got here.

943
01:21:07,792 --> 01:21:10,627
It was you.

944
01:21:10,711 --> 01:21:13,914
- You came out here to do this.
- I know what l told you, kid...

945
01:21:14,006 --> 01:21:16,462
but nobody fucks up
like your friends did here...

946
01:21:16,550 --> 01:21:19,006
and comes out of it clean. No.

947
01:21:19,094 --> 01:21:22,878
Bullshit. You came out here
to take that money.

948
01:21:29,772 --> 01:21:33,983
There were never any shortages.
You're the one who's been...

949
01:21:34,068 --> 01:21:36,903
robbing from my father,
you son of a bitch.

950
01:21:36,987 --> 01:21:38,647
Matty, it's not like that.

951
01:21:38,739 --> 01:21:41,147
Stop fuckin' tellin' me
how it is, Teddy.

952
01:21:41,242 --> 01:21:44,693
My whole life,
you been tellin' me how it is.

953
01:21:44,787 --> 01:21:47,788
You've been lying to me.

954
01:21:47,873 --> 01:21:50,198
You put me in that basement
with Bobby Boulevard...

955
01:21:50,292 --> 01:21:52,368
'cause you knew
it would break me.

956
01:21:54,964 --> 01:21:57,336
You came here tonight
to kill me.

957
01:22:00,678 --> 01:22:02,717
Tell me l'm wrong.

958
01:22:02,805 --> 01:22:06,968
Go ahead. Tell me l'm wrong
about any of it.

959
01:22:08,852 --> 01:22:11,308
What the fuck
do you want to know?

960
01:22:11,397 --> 01:22:14,433
I did what l did.

961
01:22:15,526 --> 01:22:17,565
Walkin' off
that handball court...

962
01:22:17,653 --> 01:22:21,733
dumping game after game
to your fucking old man.

963
01:22:23,283 --> 01:22:25,905
Can l tell you,
l could beat his arse...

964
01:22:25,995 --> 01:22:30,288
carrying a lawn chair
in my left hand...

965
01:22:30,374 --> 01:22:34,039
so, yeah, now l'm takin' mine.

966
01:22:37,047 --> 01:22:40,048
- No, you're not.
- I'm not?

967
01:22:42,428 --> 01:22:46,924
What are you gonna do, Matty?
You gonna shoot me?

968
01:22:47,015 --> 01:22:49,008
You're not gonna shoot me.

969
01:22:53,856 --> 01:22:57,723
I got shoes
older than you, kid...

970
01:22:57,818 --> 01:22:59,360
and tougher, too.

971
01:23:38,817 --> 01:23:40,146
Taylor?

972
01:24:40,921 --> 01:24:42,331
There it is.

973
01:24:42,422 --> 01:24:44,166
Good.

974
01:24:44,257 --> 01:24:48,207
This'll finally get me out of
the shit that Teddy put me into.

975
01:24:48,303 --> 01:24:50,711
Yeah, that's good.

976
01:24:50,806 --> 01:24:55,135
Look,
l know l was wrong about you.

977
01:25:02,025 --> 01:25:08,028
Matty,
you can come in with me now.

978
01:25:12,035 --> 01:25:16,993
You know, there was a time
l really wanted to hear that.

979
01:25:17,082 --> 01:25:21,210
Ever since l was a kid,
l've been tryin' to live up...

980
01:25:21,294 --> 01:25:25,043
to what l thought
you wanted me to be.

981
01:25:25,131 --> 01:25:30,256
I fucked up my whole life
for it...for you.

982
01:25:30,345 --> 01:25:33,512
Matty, l thought
it was what you wanted.

983
01:25:33,598 --> 01:25:35,306
I never wanted you
in this thing.

984
01:25:35,392 --> 01:25:38,761
That's what you said, but you
know the truth, same as l do.

985
01:25:38,853 --> 01:25:42,982
You never once looked at me
like l was a man.

986
01:25:43,066 --> 01:25:48,191
You never would have, either,
if l hadn't have done this.

987
01:25:49,864 --> 01:25:51,904
I'm out.

988
01:25:58,665 --> 01:26:00,657
I'll see ya, Pop.

989
01:26:20,311 --> 01:26:22,518
You told him?

990
01:26:22,605 --> 01:26:26,271
Yeah, l did.

991
01:26:26,359 --> 01:26:30,439
Good.
You're finally done with it.

992
01:26:31,781 --> 01:26:33,774
Done with this, too.

993
01:26:37,203 --> 01:26:39,160
- What now?
- Now?

994
01:26:39,247 --> 01:26:41,038
Now we get the hell outta here.

995
01:26:42,038 --> 01:26:52,038
