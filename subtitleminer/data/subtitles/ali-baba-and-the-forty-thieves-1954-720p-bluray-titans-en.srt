1
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:33,365
(Dramatic music plays over dialogue)

2
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:05,082
O Mighty Khan, the city is ours.

3
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,834
And the Caliph?

4
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,003
We have searched all Baghdad.
The Caliph has escaped.

5
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:11,964
Find him!

6
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,174
Every day until he dies,

7
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,885
a hundred of his subjects
shall be tortured.

8
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:29,731
(Fires crackle)

9
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,578
(Squawks)

10
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,433
O Mighty Caliph,

11
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:07,811
O Defender of the Faithful,
praise be to Allah

12
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:10,230
that you have come safely
through the Mongol lines.

13
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,274
My defeat is heavy upon me, Cassim.

14
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,110
The very stones of Baghdad
cry out for vengeance.

15
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:17,529
Tell me,
where have you taken my son?

16
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:20,240
Ali is safely hidden in my own house.

17
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:21,533
Then let us go quickly.

18
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:24,328
With him I journey to Basra
to raise another army.

19
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,663
You go up against the Mongols
a second time?

20
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:28,290
They are powerful enemies, My Lord.

21
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:31,460
Well, do I know their power,
but I swear to you, Cassim,

22
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:33,670
by the power that Allah
has invested in me,

23
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:35,964
I will avenge my men
who have died this day.

24
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,342
My Lord, perhaps...

25
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:42,721
Perhaps it will not be necessary
to fight these Mongols again.

26
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:44,139
Other ways might be found.

27
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:46,683
Other ways?
Your meaning is not clear, Cassim.

28
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:48,435
If you will say the word, O Caliph,

29
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,854
I will arrange a meeting
between you and the Khan.

30
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,066
You and your nobles may be permitted
to live on in luxury.

31
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:57,319
To avoid further bloodshed,
we might arrange terms.

32
00:03:57,445 --> 00:04:00,530
Terms? There will be no terms,
except death to the Mongols.

33
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,866
Blood runs in the streets
of Baghdad, My Lord.

34
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:05,494
Aye, the blood of brave men
who died for freedom.

35
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,247
Yours is the counsel of a coward,
Prince Cassim.

36
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:10,958
Forgive me.

37
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,252
Come, take me to my son.

38
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:16,546
My Lord, it were best
I stay here with men

39
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,799
to guard the road
against a surprise attack.

40
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,717
Mahmoud knows the way.

41
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:24,346
You'll find dhows at my landing.
Everything is ready.

42
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:26,223
You have served me well,
Prince Cassim.

43
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:28,809
With the help of Allah,
we shall meet again in Baghdad.

44
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,686
Then you shall have your reward.

45
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:54,793
(Girl gasps)

46
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,003
Shh!

47
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,170
(Woman) Lady Amara!

48
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,714
Lady Amara!

49
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:00,757
Quick!

50
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:03,844
Out of your beds at this hour!

51
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,762
In a moment we will come, Nilah.

52
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:08,932
If Prince Cassim knew
that his daughter were up at this hour!

53
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:10,642
In a moment, I said.

54
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:13,145
In a moment! In a moment!

55
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,273
Now, before she changes
her mind again.

56
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,193
There. It is done.

57
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,405
Your blood has flowed into my arm
and mine into yours.

58
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:27,075
- But I'm afraid...
- You cannot be afraid now.

59
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:29,578
The blood of a Caliph
flows in your arm.

60
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,581
I'm afraid I'm going to be sick.

61
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:36,960
Is that not like a girl!
Sick at the sight of a little blood!

62
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:38,628
I...

63
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,714
I'm all right now, Ali.

64
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:44,384
We are pledged now, Amara.

65
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:52,476
It will go on forever,
like the ripples in the water.

66
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,561
Now we shall never be apart.

67
00:05:56,606 --> 00:06:03,445
Father!

68
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:04,905
My son!

69
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:11,161
Ali, we sail to Basra tonight.

70
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:12,245
(Amara) Ali!

71
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,872
Father!

72
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:16,583
Ali, you said
we would never part!

73
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,920
I'm sorry to take your playmate away,
little Amara.

74
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,672
- But you said...
- I said that we would never be apart.

75
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,883
And that is true,
for now, wherever I am,

76
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:28,095
some of my blood is with you,
and some of yours is with me.

77
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:32,265
That's all right for you to say,
but you are going to Basra.

78
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:42,651
So, my little son
grows into a man.

79
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:45,821
(Man) My Lord, the dhows are ready.
We await your coming.

80
00:06:58,835 --> 00:06:59,960
Ali.

81
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,383
Yes, Father?

82
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:09,719
My son, the future of Baghdad
depends upon this journey.

83
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:13,348
If we fail, our people will die
under the heel of the Khan.

84
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:16,726
But if we succeed, they will live
as a free people once more.

85
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:17,978
Yes, Father.

86
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:22,941
About your neck I place
the Royal Seal of Baghdad.

87
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:28,238
And if some evil should befall me,
you, my son, will rule in my place.

88
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,490
Remember this always,

89
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:33,827
while one of us lives, Baghdad lives.

90
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:37,873
I will never fail you
or Baghdad, Father.

91
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,055
My Lord!

92
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,309
Come ashore!

93
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:58,685
Come ashore at once!

94
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:01,271
Something has happened
Turn back, Mahmoud.

95
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:04,441
Turn back?
It may be a trick, My Lord.

96
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:07,527
Prince Cassim is our friend.
He may be in trouble.

97
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:12,449
Turn back!

98
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,655
Quickly! Over the side.

99
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,286
(Groans)

100
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:29,901
The Caliph of Baghdad.

101
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,736
You did not lie.

102
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:33,905
The Mighty Khan will reward you greatly.

103
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:38,994
And the boy? Where is the boy?

104
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:42,831
He must have drowned.

105
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,916
(Mahmoud) Fire the boats!

106
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,283
Close, oh Sesame!

107
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:01,868
(Echoes repeat)

108
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,265
Sesame...

109
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,477
Sesame?

110
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,606
(Shouts) Sesame!

111
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:34,609
(Echoes repeat)

112
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,033
Sesame.

113
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,577
Close, Sesame.

114
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,418
(Shouts) Open, oh Sesame!

115
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,919
(Echoes)

116
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:16,813
(Man 2) Baba!

117
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:21,568
We've caught a mouse.

118
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,111
Allah, defend us.

119
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:31,870
(Laughs) Your mouse has teeth.

120
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,788
Another move and you'll die!

121
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:36,749
Oh! O, spare me, little master!

122
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:40,420
Oh, here I lay
in the dust before you.

123
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,046
Oh, pity!

124
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:43,840
Let me go free, and I'll spare him.

125
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,383
The lad has spirit.

126
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:48,428
Now that you've got him,
what are you going to do with him?

127
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,221
I'll split his ears!

128
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:51,723
Cut him up in little pieces.

129
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:55,018
Tie him up by the thumbs!
That'll take the spirit out of him!

130
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:56,769
Put him down, I say!

131
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:59,814
This is no time forjesting.

132
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,233
The boy knows the secret of our cave.

133
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:04,652
- Then kill him!
- No...

134
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:06,112
It is best we keep him with us.

135
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,448
I'd join no band of thieves.

136
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,450
But I'll lead you against the Mongols.

137
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,577
The little mouse shall lead us!

138
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,746
The boy speaks like a king.

139
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,291
I wear the Seal of Baghdad.

140
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:25,340
By Allah! The boy speaks the truth!

141
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,052
You were right, Old Baba,
he does belong with us.

142
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:32,055
Anyone that could steal
that amulet is a thief indeed.

143
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,223
You are the cleverest thief among us.

144
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,560
I am no thief!
The Seal belongs to me.

145
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:40,605
My father, the Caliph,
gave it to me before he...

146
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,942
Before he died at the hands
of the Mongols.

147
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,610
The Caliph is dead?

148
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:48,780
Aye, he was betrayed
by Prince Cassim.

149
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:51,366
Now do you believe me?
Now will you follow me?

150
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,868
We have no love for the Mongols.

151
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:57,413
If they have stripped Baghdad
of everything worth stealing,

152
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:58,915
we will soon rob them.

153
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,833
- Eh, my men?
- (All) Aye!

154
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,585
We will ride together,

155
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:05,046
and you, Abdullah,
shall be his guard and protector.

156
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,715
Me, Abdullah?

157
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:10,927
The terror of Baghdad
nurse to a whimpering infant?

158
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,971
This boy will never whimper.

159
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:15,223
And should he go hungry,
you will starve.

160
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:17,642
Should he suffer,
you will be disembowelled.

161
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:20,436
Abdullah, the fastest rider,
the greatest swordsman,

162
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:22,397
the fiercest fighter!

163
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,441
And now I'm the nursemaid.

164
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:26,901
(Laughter)

165
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:29,862
If Allah had granted me a son,

166
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,865
I would have wished him
in your image.

167
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,077
I am known as Old Baba,

168
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:40,039
and we will call you Young Baba.

169
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,375
No, my name is Ali.

170
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:47,422
You are welcome, Ali Baba.

171
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:52,635
Ali Baba!

172
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:54,220

(Echoes)

200
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:02,390
(Man shouts) Baba! Baba!

201
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:15,069
Baba, a rich Mongol caravan,
camels by the score,

202
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:16,654
laden with wealth!

203
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,531
Where did you see such a caravan?

204
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:19,991
Camped beside the Pool of Midnight.

205
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:21,909
They bring wedding gifts from Basra.

206
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:25,329
There is a woman in the caravan.
She is betrothed to Hulagu Khan.

207
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:27,248
The betrothed of the Mighty Khan!

208
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:30,293
By Allah! That is
a prize worth taking.

209
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,295
And it is all ours for the asking.

210
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,046
Treasure like that is well guarded.

211
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,300
A few soldiers scattered about,
some aged camel drivers

212
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,135
and the slave girls
who attend the bride.

213
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,637
- There is your guards.
- To the Pool of Midnight!

214
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:44,432
No, wait! We must not rush
headlong into danger.

215
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:48,352
Does the little mouse fear
aged camel drivers and slave girls?

216
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:50,897
Surely Ali does not object
without a reason.

217
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:54,525
My son, let's hear your counsel.

218
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:56,986
Remember, there is a price
on our heads.

219
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:58,946
Aye, 10,000 pieces of gold.

220
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:01,240
Think you the Khan
would bring his own betrothed,

221
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:05,203
under the very shadow of our swords,
without his butchers guarding her?

222
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:07,163
You speak wisdom, my son.

223
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,290
Then let us move with caution.

224
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:13,586
The wealth of kings collected for us,
and all in one caravan!

225
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:16,297
Now we let it go
for fear of shadows.

226
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:18,257
We will take the caravan,

227
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:22,261
but, first, I will make certain
it is not a golden snare.

228
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:25,848
We will wait for your signal.
Abdullah, go with him.

229
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:30,269
Ten years! Still the nursemaid.

230
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:54,502
(Amara) Why am I forced to bear
the heat of the day inside my tent?

231
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:57,004
I am a prisoner in my own caravan.

232
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,966
Such was the order
of Hulagu Khan, My Lady.

233
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,176
But why?

234
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:06,764
Already the great Khan
guards you jealously, Lady Amara.

235
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:10,393
The beauty of his Queen
is not for the eyes of all men.

236
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:16,649
You forget, I am not yet
Queen of Baghdad.

237
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,819
Besides, who is there
to see me here?

238
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:23,114
A few old camel drivers
and a handful of guards.

239
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,158
It is not ours to question, My Lady.

240
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:33,541
Nalu!

241
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:35,668
Yes, My Lady.

242
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:40,506
You have lived
in the court of Baghdad.

243
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:43,509
Tell me, what is the Khan really like?

244
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,679
He is magnificent, My Lady.

245
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,472
He rules the world.

246
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:51,851
He is the greatest warrior
in all the land.

247
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,686
Ali Baba is greater.

248
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:56,105
Slave, you would be flogged

249
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:59,483
if your words reached
the ears of the great Khan.

250
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:05,031
We are camped beside
the Pool of Midnight, My Lady.

251
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:08,409
The water is clear
and blue and very cool.

252
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:11,412
Then I need not bear
this terrible heat any longer.

253
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:16,334
My Lady, you may not leave your tent.
The guard would not permit it.

254
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:20,046
Attract the attention
of the guards, Jamiel.

255
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,589
Give me your clothes.

256
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:23,090
But the order of the Khan!

257
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:25,718
Hulagu Khan is not yet my master.

258
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,219
Your clothes.

259
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:38,564
Wait here. I will signal.

260
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:42,860
Let me go! I haven't killed
a single Mongol all day!

261
00:22:58,126 --> 00:22:59,627
(Water splashes)

262
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:16,060
(Ali Baba) Hello.

263
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:21,607
Where are you?

264
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:26,195
I'm curious to see you.

265
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:28,906
I feed on the curiosity
of foolish men.

266
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:36,580
An evil genie in the pool.

267
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:38,165
I distract the thoughts of men

268
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:40,835
and lead them in
the ways of mischief.

269
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:43,045
I know the ways of mischief.

270
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:44,755
Come out and let me see you.

271
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:02,440
A confection of the gods!

272
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:05,985
Are you among the men in the caravan?

273
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,695
I haven't seen you before.

274
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:10,656
I'm a weary traveller
who also takes the road to Baghdad.

275
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:13,117
And your caravan rests
beside the Pool of Midnight?

276
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:14,660
Nay, I am alone.

277
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:16,203
I hope to join your caravan,

278
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:18,330
and so find protection
against the thieves.

279
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:19,999
Oh, that's not possible.

280
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:23,043
We carry the betrothed
of Hulagu Khan.

281
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,129
Now go away and let me dress.

282
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:33,596
What manner of woman is she
who marries the Khan?

283
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:36,974
Very much like any other woman.

284
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,767
Some find her beautiful.

285
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:53,991
If I had a thousand pieces of gold,
I would give them all for you.

286
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:56,160
A thousand pieces of gold?

287
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,538
That's not enough. My price is high.

288
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:04,418
My mistress awaits my coming.

289
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:06,795
Who may your mistress be

290
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:08,923
that you grudge me
a few minutes of your company?

291
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:13,594
She's the betrothed of Hulagu Khan.

292
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,471
Return to your mistress, then.

293
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:19,308
But know I shall come to you
under the stars.

294
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:22,436
And someday I will buy you
for my very own.

295
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:26,065
It is the duty of a slave
to please her master,

296
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:29,902
and if that master
be young and handsome,

297
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:31,529
so much the better.

298
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,242
Wait!

299
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,203
Tell me.

300
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,706
Would I be safe in your caravan?

301
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:47,628
- Is it well guarded?
- It is not guarded at all!

302
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:51,674
Who would dare rob
the betrothed of Hulagu Khan?

303
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,092
Who indeed?

304
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:56,887
(Tree branch breaks)

305
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:01,892
What are you...?

306
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,509
Abdullah!

307
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:38,470
It's a trap!
Ride for your life!

308
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,065
(Nalu) My Lady!
(Jamiel) You are not harmed?

309
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:52,443
- Are you all right?
- I'm safe.

310
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:55,529
Woman of the Mongols! Traitor!

311
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:10,896
- Well?
- We lost him. He was too far ahead.

312
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:14,775
One poor thief is a small catch!

313
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:20,280
But we'll take him back to Baghdad.

314
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:23,409
The people shall see what happens
to those who defy the Khan.

315
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:33,419
Jamiel.

316
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:35,462
Yes, My Lady?

317
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:37,506
What will they do to the thief?

318
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:40,467
They will make an example
for all Baghdad to see.

319
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:44,096
The whip and the rack,
mangled on the wheel perhaps.

320
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:46,890
He is one of the thieves, My Lady.
It is hard telling what they will do.

321
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:49,101
Can we not find
some way to help him?

322
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:51,270
Help an enemy of Hulagu Khan?

323
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:53,480
We must take care, My Lady.

324
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:57,943
Jamiel, somehow see to it
that he does not thirst.

325
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:19,715
Is one permitted to curse
that mangy thief?

326
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:27,055
Dog of a thief!
Ignominious son of a camel!

327
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,683
- Filthy scum!
- Why, you...

328
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,530
The ride across the desert
will be very hot.

329
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:45,949
Here is water
for your parched lips.

330
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:53,123
There are many in Baghdad who love
the followers of your leader, Ali Baba.

331
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:55,125
Allah be with you.

332
00:29:56,669 --> 00:30:00,547
May Allah send you warts
and give you bedbugs for company!

333
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:57,312
O Mighty Khan,

334
00:30:57,438 --> 00:31:01,149
Ruler of the World,
Master of the Universe,

335
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:03,569
my daughter, Lady Amara.

336
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:28,719
Know, O Mighty Khan,

337
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:31,680
that peace and happiness
will come once more to Baghdad

338
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:36,184
when the blood of my noble family
blends with that of the Mongols.

339
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:39,146
Because she's your daughter,
Prince Cassim,

340
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:42,441
there will be
a royal marriage ceremony.

341
00:31:58,124 --> 00:31:59,499
Nalu, you may go.

342
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:07,341
As the bride of Hulagu Khan,

343
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:09,927
you will one day rule the world,
my daughter.

344
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:12,721
And if I do not choose
to rule the world, Father?

345
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:14,181
We must face facts, Amara.

346
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:15,974
Once you are married to Hulagu,

347
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,727
my position in this court
will be made safe.

348
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:23,398
Must I be sacrificed for your position
in the court of this tyrant?

349
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:25,233
Amara!

350
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,403
For years I have planned
and worked for this.

351
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:31,740
I have suffered contempt
and humiliation at his hands.

352
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:33,825
That is why I have kept you in Basra.

353
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:36,536
Now that my dream
is about to be realised,

354
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:38,664
I will not see it shattered.

355
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:42,626
And if I refuse to marry the Khan?

356
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:45,128
Why not accept conditions
as they are, Amara?

357
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:52,219
This marriage brings wealth
and power and luxury.

358
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:55,555
Would you rather starve
and die for a lost cause?

359
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:58,266
That choice is easy.

360
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:01,853
When you look on the tortured bodies
of those who stood against the Khan,

361
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,730
you will know what it means to rebel.

362
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:07,025
When you know the agony
of a thousand deaths,

363
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:09,486
you will be glad
to accept my counsel.

364
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:13,615
Amara...

365
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:20,330
For your sake I have been
a slave to the whims of the Khan.

366
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:23,375
For you I have sacrificed
my dignity that...

367
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:26,128
That you may one day
reign in Baghdad.

368
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:28,839
Does all this mean nothing to you?

369
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:45,188
It is written that a daughter
must obey her father.

370
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:51,737
The wealth of the world
shall be yours, Amara.

371
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:54,281
Your slightest whims
shall be commands.

372
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:57,451
You will never regret
what you have done for me this day.

373
00:33:58,494 --> 00:34:00,078
The Khan calls for you,
Prince Cassim.

374
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:20,766
See how the thongs
cut his flesh, Cassim.

375
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:23,018
A thief bleeds as any other man.

376
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:27,439
And the hatred in his eyes, Cassim.

377
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:31,359
His gall bladder is like to burst
with the venom that is in him.

378
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,405
I have given the order for
your execution at noon tomorrow.

379
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:40,702
But if you tell me the hiding place
of the thieves of Ali Baba,

380
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:42,829
a way to freedom might be found.

381
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:45,123
Shall I trust the enemy
of my people?

382
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:48,585
Or the murderer of the Caliph?

383
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:08,688
Who are you?

384
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:11,858
I'm the sword hanging over your head.

385
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:17,823
By moonrise tomorrow,
you will be carrion for the vultures.

386
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:29,251
(Cassim) I know how to deal
with these men of Baghdad.

387
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:31,044
I will wring the secret from him.

388
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,671
Splendid!

389
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,056
The Royal Seal of Baghdad!

390
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:46,810
On your knees before it, you traitor!

391
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,314
I begin to see now.

392
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,608
You were not drowned.

393
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:58,530
You are Ali. Ali Baba the thief!

394
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:02,325
Ali, the son of Hassan!

395
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:05,245
Aye, Cassim, the son of Hassan,

396
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:07,372
the friend whom you betrayed
to the Mongols!

397
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:09,749
Hassan is dead. Speak no more of him.

398
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:13,879
His memory lives,
and I will avenge his death.

399
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,182
By noon tomorrow you will be dead.

400
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:26,892
Nay.

401
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:31,062
Tomorrow I will see the moon rise,
and yet another moonrise.

402
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:36,193
And in the end, I will point the way
for the vultures to find your body!

403
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:52,083
Jamiel, your eyes
will be burned from your head,

404
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,418
if you are discovered here.

405
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:57,380
I thought you'd like to know,
the thief is tied in the marketplace.

406
00:36:57,506 --> 00:36:59,090
He dies tomorrow.

407
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:01,551
What is that to me?

408
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:04,262
You would not let him die
cursing your name.

409
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,264
He thinks you led him into this trap.

410
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,058
What would you have me do?

411
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:10,477
You could have a word
with the prisoner.

412
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:11,978
Are you mad?

413
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:14,439
I cannot go to the marketplace
to speak to a thief.

414
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:17,317
This thief is a follower of Ali Baba.

415
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:21,071
He dies because he dared
to defy the Mongol tyrants.

416
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:23,782
Is he not worthy of your comfort?

417
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:27,953
He's a fool to die for a lost cause.

418
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,538
Should he then live a slave?

419
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:35,043
Is it better to live taxed
and trampled upon than to die a man?

420
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:39,172
I have known the tortures of chains,
as I know the value of freedom.

421
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:40,423
These thieves...

422
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:44,636
They will be remembered
long after the Mongols are driven out.

423
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:48,765
Oh, you will come, My Lady. Please.

424
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:38,857
Now you come to torment me,
beloved of the butcher.

425
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:41,609
Beloved of the...!

426
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:50,285
I came to tell you that I did not know
of the trap that was laid for you.

427
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,870
What does that matter?

428
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:54,122
The Mongols were hiding at the pool
and they took me.

429
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:56,249
I cannot let you die thinking

430
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:58,293
that I have delivered you
to the soldiers.

431
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:00,754
Hundreds die in Baghdad every day.

432
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,797
Why should one more matter?
And that one a thief?

433
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:06,092
Because hundreds die
and I can do nothing about it.

434
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:08,094
I want you to know
that I would never betray you,

435
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:11,598
or any follower of... of anyone.

436
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:14,559
Must you torture me with your lies?

437
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:19,397
Why would the future Queen of Baghdad
risk discovery to torture you?

438
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:21,983
Why should I come
to the marketplace to lie to a thief?

439
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:24,152
Why, indeed?

440
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:27,947
Except to trick me into telling you
the hiding place of Ali Baba.

441
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:30,200
Return to your butcher
and tell him that neither you

442
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:32,285
nor Cassim will ever
wring the secret from me!

443
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:53,556
(Horn blares an alarm signal)

444
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:47,444
(Trumpeting continues)

445
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:30,153
(Shouting)

446
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:06,481
Again you come before me
with evil tidings.

447
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:09,108
Again you tell me
these robbers have escaped.

448
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:17,200
I send troops there!
I send an expedition here!

449
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:20,370
I set traps for them.
And what happens?

450
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:24,541
My entire army is not capable
of dealing with forty thieves!

451
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:26,167
We outnumber them,
we ride them down,

452
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:29,337
we surround them, we charge,
only to face each other.

453
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:32,090
They disappear into thin air,
O Mighty One!

454
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:36,511
Craven liar! The truth is not in you.

455
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:39,931
And now they come within
the walls of Baghdad itself.

456
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:42,725
Under the nose of my own guards
they will ride into Baghdad

457
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:45,770
to rescue the only member
of their band we've ever captured!

458
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:48,439
And to steal the betrothed
of Hulagu Khan.

459
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:54,821
By the thousand one-eyed kings,
I will have their heads for it.

460
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:58,533
Their heads, or yours!

461
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:06,040
We must take him back
into the cave, Ali.

462
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:09,877
Nay, let me die as I have lived,

463
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:13,256
here in the open desert
under the stars.

464
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:17,218
A little wine, Old Baba.
It will strengthen you.

465
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:19,512
My strength is spent.

466
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:22,807
You will live to ride
with us again, Old Baba.

467
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:24,058
Many times.

468
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:26,352
You will ride again, my son.

469
00:43:26,478 --> 00:43:32,275
Again and again until the Mongols
are driven from Baghdad.

470
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:34,777
Without you to lead us,
we will never triumph.

471
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:38,489
For ten years you have led this band.

472
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:42,994
When he came to us we were thieves,

473
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:46,205
despised and feared by the people.

474
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:50,585
Now we are loved and honoured.

475
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:54,422
Shh. You tire yourself, Old Baba.

476
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:58,384
There are things I must say
before I leave you.

477
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:02,513
Return to Baghdad, my son.

478
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:05,975
You cannot escape your destiny.

479
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:09,937
Avenge your father
and free your people.

480
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:12,940
They must throw off the tyrant.

481
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:18,404
Remember, Abdullah,

482
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:21,032
you are still his nursemaid.

483
00:44:34,546 --> 00:44:39,592
Forty and one for all.

484
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:50,019
Allah be with you, my son.

485
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,476
We found a spy at the outpost
near the Great Rock.

486
00:45:30,602 --> 00:45:33,187
- What was he doing there?
- Following our trail.

487
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:44,198
I am no spy!

488
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:47,618
Release him.

489
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:53,791
I know not who you are,
but once you were very kind to me.

490
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:56,419
You brought me water
when I was a prisoner.

491
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:59,505
And it was your knife that
saved my life in the marketplace.

492
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:02,633
Why? Why did you do these things?

493
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,887
When I brought the water
to your cage in the caravan,

494
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:07,930
I did not know who you were,

495
00:46:08,056 --> 00:46:10,141
but I would have died
for any follower of Ali Baba.

496
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:13,644
She whom you serve
will soon be Queen in Baghdad.

497
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:15,688
Why should you be willing
to die for Ali Baba?

498
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:19,650
Because I have seen
what the Mongols do to our people,

499
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:22,779
and have heard the songs
that are sung in secret,

500
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:25,615
songs of praise for Ali Baba.

501
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:26,866
Let me join your band.

502
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:30,369
Are we a wandering tribe of nomads?

503
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:33,289
Do we collect lazy desert rats
as we go?

504
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:40,338
Desert rats did you say, Abdullah?

505
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:43,674
By the prophet,
I'll slice him to little pieces.

506
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:46,594
Your choice.

507
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:50,973
(Coughs and clears throat)

508
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:52,600
Sharp, aren't they?

509
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:55,353
I'll let you go this time.

510
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:57,855
Abdullah! The terror of Baghdad!

511
00:46:57,981 --> 00:46:59,190
(Laughter)

512
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:01,234
You're very clever with your knives.

513
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,736
But how do I know
you've not come from the Khan?

514
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:06,155
Set me a task that I may prove it.

515
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:07,824
(Abdullah)
Think you can trust him, Ali?

516
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:09,951
You can trust me
as you can trust your own eyes.

517
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:12,203
I will not fail you, Ali Baba.

518
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:13,871
Are you well known in Baghdad?

519
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:16,040
Aye. I can move freely
within the gates.

520
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:17,834
No one will question me.

521
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:22,046
Good. Then you shall deliver
my message to the Mighty Khan.

522
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:23,756
- The Khan?
- Aye.

523
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:27,009
I have written that if he delivers
Cassim to me by noon tomorrow,

524
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:29,387
I shall return him his bride.

525
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:32,515
Now we buy traitors
in the open market!

526
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:36,435
A female beauty
for the grand vizier!

527
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:39,397
The Khan must deliver Cassim
to his own riverbank estate.

528
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:40,898
We will await them there.

529
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:42,400
They'll set a trap for us, Ali.

530
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:44,652
Then we shall post sentries
to warn us.

531
00:47:44,778 --> 00:47:47,154
Go, and Allah be with you.

532
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:51,742
We must move quickly
before they have time to set a trap.

533
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:53,286
Abdullah, bring the girl.

534
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:56,372
Men, on to the house
of the traitor Cassim!

535
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:12,930
Close, oh Sesame!

536
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:14,807
(Echoes)

537
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:01,354
Why have you brought me here?

538
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,941
If all goes well, you'll be returned
to your beloved by noon tomorrow.

539
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:07,318
And if all doesn't go well...

540
00:49:08,403 --> 00:49:10,529
Why don't you kill me
and be done with it?

541
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:13,658
While we hold you alive,
the Khan must listen to our demands.

542
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:17,203
What have your demands
to do with me?

543
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:19,205
That is not yours to question, My Lady.

544
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:32,051
Where are you going?

545
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:35,638
Is one permitted to go
into one's own garden?

546
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:40,768
Yes.

547
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:47,233
Why do you give her all this freedom?

548
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:01,163
If you were her prisoner,

549
00:50:01,289 --> 00:50:04,667
she would serve you
baked, sliced and on a platter.

550
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:32,653
Strange are the fortunes of war
which place the thief

551
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:34,613
beside the Khan's beloved.

552
00:50:37,617 --> 00:50:40,745
I'm curious to know
why one so beautiful, so young,

553
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:43,622
should marry the ruthless Khan.

554
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:45,875
I shall be Queen in Baghdad.

555
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:51,422
Does that mean more to you than love,
more than happiness?

556
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:54,175
Why are you suddenly
so kind and gentle?

557
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:57,178
My memory is long.

558
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:59,764
I can recall a country
when the Mongol scourge

559
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:02,850
was nothing
but a fantastic nightmare.

560
00:51:02,976 --> 00:51:05,311
When the people lived
to dream and love.

561
00:51:06,688 --> 00:51:09,190
Not to torment and destroy.

562
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:13,110
Strange that Ali Baba
should speak of dreams.

563
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:16,822
A man without his dreams
withers and grows old.

564
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:22,828
In the midst of terror,
the memory of other days is sweet.

565
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:25,372
Aye.

566
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:30,044
There was a beautiful garden
where two children played.

567
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:33,130
The moonlight was reflected
on the water.

568
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:35,382
As it is reflected
in your eyes now.

569
00:51:43,308 --> 00:51:47,186
For a moment you made me forget
that you are Ali Baba, the thief.

570
00:51:49,314 --> 00:51:53,859
If these are to be my last moments,
let me live them in peace.

571
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:18,217
(Ali Baba) There. It is done.

572
00:52:18,343 --> 00:52:21,178
Your blood has flowed into my arm,
and mine into yours.

573
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:06,098
Call the guards!
Surround the palace!

574
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:18,944
What does it say?

575
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:22,072
- "To the...
- Read it!

576
00:53:23,658 --> 00:53:27,328
"To the Mongol Dog.
We will bargain with you.

577
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:30,497
"Your betrothed is our prisoner.
In exchange..."

578
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,084
Read it. Read it, I say!

579
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:37,546
"In exchange we want Cassim.

580
00:53:37,672 --> 00:53:39,715
"Cassim, who betrayed the Caliph.

581
00:53:39,841 --> 00:53:42,676
"Let him be brought to his own estate
before noon tomorrow,

582
00:53:42,802 --> 00:53:45,304
"then the woman will be
returned to you unharmed.

583
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:48,182
"Otherwise she dies."

584
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:51,477
It is signed with
the mark of Ali Baba.

585
00:53:53,813 --> 00:53:55,606
Can we not send soldiers
to the estate?

586
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:57,691
This may be our chance
to capture the thieves!

587
00:53:57,817 --> 00:54:00,861
He is no fool!
He will watch for every trick!

588
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:07,034
I leave the decision to you.
She is your own daughter.

589
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:10,955
Shall it be your life, or hers?

590
00:54:27,847 --> 00:54:29,723
Cassim does not come.

591
00:54:34,729 --> 00:54:36,438
He does not come.
Why do we wait?

592
00:54:36,564 --> 00:54:39,316
- Vengeance for Old Baba!
- Remember our pledge!

593
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:40,651
Listen.

594
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:47,283
(Shouting)

595
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:00,296
Why do you want to kill me?

596
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:03,340
To avenge the death
of our Old Baba.

597
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:05,259
What is the death
of your Old Baba to me?

598
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:06,468
(Jeering)

599
00:55:06,594 --> 00:55:09,138
He was our leader. He died
of wounds inflicted by the soldiers

600
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:11,098
of Hulagu Khan, your beloved.

601
00:55:11,224 --> 00:55:13,559
A life for a life, that is our law!

602
00:55:13,685 --> 00:55:15,519
(Jeering)

603
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:18,272
If you kill me, the great Khan
will send soldiers to take you.

604
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:20,441
For years the great Khan
has sent soldiers,

605
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:22,276
and he hasn't taken us yet.

606
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:23,569
(Jeering)

607
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:27,197
Silence! Have I given you nothing
in the past years?

608
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:30,159
Fighting and snarling
like a pack of curs!

609
00:55:30,285 --> 00:55:32,202
The men are tired of waiting.

610
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:35,748
You gave them your pledge.
The traitor has not come.

611
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:37,041
I have made my decision.

612
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:39,752
Then let me be the one
to carry it out for you.

613
00:55:39,878 --> 00:55:42,046
No. Jamiel shall do it.

614
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:48,302
I, Ali Baba?

615
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:50,220
You begged to follow me, Jamiel.

616
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:53,390
Ask anything else of me,
anything but this.

617
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:55,809
You will do as I say.
There's no better way to serve me.

618
00:55:55,935 --> 00:55:59,063
Coward! You would force
my own slave to...

619
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:01,106
Take her back to the Khan. Alive.

620
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:06,153
Alive? But our message to the Khan.
Our pledge.

621
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:08,947
(Jeering)

622
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:12,076
All night I lay awake,
telling myself she must die.

623
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:15,204
Now, I break my pledge.

624
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:17,873
Why must you weaken now?

625
00:56:17,999 --> 00:56:21,001
Whatever my reason,
she goes free.

626
00:56:21,127 --> 00:56:24,088
- But the Mongols will laugh at you.
- Let them laugh!

627
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:26,215
You have heard my decision.

628
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:37,726
If you want me
to leave the band, I will go.

629
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:40,187
Then I will fight you for her life.

630
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,192
Send her away if you must.

631
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:49,071
We cannot quarrel with you
over a woman.

632
00:56:53,618 --> 00:56:55,077
Now take her back to Baghdad.

633
00:57:01,334 --> 00:57:03,502
Now will you tell us
why you spared her?

634
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:26,608
Your blood has flowed into my arm,
and mine into yours.

635
00:57:28,361 --> 00:57:30,696
It will go on forever.

636
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:39,455
Your horses are waiting,
Prince Cassim.

637
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:42,499
By hard riding,
you can still arrive before noon.

638
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:45,878
Great Khan, for years
I have served you.

639
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:48,755
I sacrificed my honour,
I betrayed my friend,

640
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:51,508
and helped to deliver Baghdad
into your hands.

641
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:56,221
Would you sacrifice your daughter
to save your own miserable skin?

642
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:59,141
How do we know
he will keep his word?

643
00:57:59,267 --> 00:58:01,018
Thieves do not keep their bargains.

644
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:04,229
Ali Baba will slay Amara
and then kill me.

645
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:08,233
Have mercy, Mighty Khan!
Have mercy!

646
00:58:08,359 --> 00:58:11,278
The road of a conqueror
is never an easy one,

647
00:58:11,404 --> 00:58:15,157
but I find the hardest part of it
is trying to deal with you traitors.

648
00:58:16,075 --> 00:58:18,076
You are a breed apart.

649
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:24,249
Take him away!

650
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:29,505
See to it that he reaches
his estate before noon.

651
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:30,964
Mighty One.

652
00:58:34,427 --> 00:58:35,469
Father!

653
00:58:38,431 --> 00:58:40,224
Amara!

654
00:58:44,145 --> 00:58:46,146
- Father.
- Come here!

655
00:58:55,323 --> 00:58:59,326
Tell me, by what wiles did you secure
your release from the thieves?

656
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:02,454
I cannot explain it.

657
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:07,084
This morning Ali Baba
defied his men and set me free.

658
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:09,503
But he bargained
for the life of your father.

659
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:13,840
For the life of my father...

660
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:15,217
You were to die at noon,

661
00:59:15,343 --> 00:59:17,469
if he were not there
to take your place.

662
00:59:18,846 --> 00:59:20,222
What manner of woman are you

663
00:59:20,348 --> 00:59:22,391
that thieves and cut-throats
release you?

664
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:28,939
Why should he seek to kill you?

665
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:32,150
I saw how he hated you there
in the marketplace.

666
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:34,695
What is it between you
and this Ali Baba?

667
00:59:36,447 --> 00:59:37,739
Speak!

668
00:59:37,865 --> 00:59:39,408
Father.

669
00:59:40,618 --> 00:59:46,206
This... This Ali Baba is Ali,
the son of the Caliph.

670
00:59:52,213 --> 00:59:53,422
Ali!

671
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:57,301
You told me he was drowned.

672
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:58,927
We never found him.

673
00:59:59,053 --> 01:00:01,263
How do you know
he's the son of Hassan?

674
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:03,473
He wore the Royal Seal
of Baghdad about his neck.

675
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,517
Why didn't you tell me then?

676
01:00:05,643 --> 01:00:06,727
I thought he would die there,

677
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:08,353
and thus the threat to us
would be removed.

678
01:00:08,479 --> 01:00:10,731
But he lives!

679
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:13,775
And he will rally the scum
of Baghdad under his banner.

680
01:00:13,901 --> 01:00:16,903
Why did you not tell me?
You knew we were pledged.

681
01:00:17,488 --> 01:00:21,742
So... he would have double reason
for his revenge upon you.

682
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:24,536
They pledged themselves as children.

683
01:00:24,662 --> 01:00:26,705
Pledge?

684
01:00:26,831 --> 01:00:29,082
But the pledge
still burns in his heart.

685
01:00:29,208 --> 01:00:31,793
And it is stronger
than his hate of me.

686
01:00:32,587 --> 01:00:34,796
Our marriage will go on as planned.

687
01:00:34,922 --> 01:00:36,632
You do us great honour.

688
01:00:37,717 --> 01:00:39,676
No! It will not go on!

689
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:43,930
I cannot marry him now!

690
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:46,016
And you shan't force me to.

691
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:48,935
Now, now, Amara,
I think only of your happiness.

692
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:51,104
Were you thinking of my happiness

693
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:53,774
when you did not tell me
that Ali is alive?

694
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:56,318
You know how much
that pledge meant to me.

695
01:00:57,862 --> 01:01:00,155
- We will talk of this later, Amara.
- No!

696
01:01:01,574 --> 01:01:04,534
O Mighty Khan!
You have power and wealth.

697
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:06,370
You have only to command it,

698
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:08,497
and the most beautiful girls
in Baghdad

699
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:10,332
will be yours for the asking.

700
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:13,669
Surely you wouldn't want me,
knowing that I love Ali Baba.

701
01:01:18,549 --> 01:01:21,927
What is love compared
to what I have to offer you?

702
01:01:22,053 --> 01:01:23,845
I can make you a queen.

703
01:01:23,971 --> 01:01:26,723
I can give you silks, jewels,
wealth and power!

704
01:01:27,392 --> 01:01:30,977
The blood of Baghdad
would be on any gift you offered me.

705
01:01:32,063 --> 01:01:35,941
'Tis a pity one so lovely
should be confused by politics.

706
01:01:36,067 --> 01:01:39,861
Once I was confused.
I see clearly now.

707
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:42,864
Too clearly!

708
01:01:42,990 --> 01:01:45,409
Nothing you say or do will ever

709
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:48,537
induce me to marry
this Mongol tyrant!

710
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:01,049
Be gentle with her.
She's wild and headstrong.

711
01:02:01,175 --> 01:02:03,176
This has been a great shock.

712
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:08,390
But I can make her realise
the future lies in your hands.

713
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:17,149
Hurry! Take only what is necessary.
We have no time to lose.

714
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:21,236
- Did you find Jamiel?
- Yes, My Lady.

715
01:02:21,362 --> 01:02:24,030
- Everything is ready for you.
- Then let's go quickly.

716
01:02:25,658 --> 01:02:27,617
My Lady, come!

717
01:02:30,621 --> 01:02:31,997
Look!

718
01:02:40,006 --> 01:02:41,381
(Cassim groans)

719
01:03:06,824 --> 01:03:10,076
Your men torture my father.
What is the meaning of this?

720
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:18,418
Cut him down from the rack and...

721
01:03:19,754 --> 01:03:21,421
And I'll marry you.

722
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:30,806
Because he has served me well,
I will grant your wish.

723
01:03:31,516 --> 01:03:35,101
Only release him
and I'll do anything you ask.

724
01:03:49,325 --> 01:03:52,786
We shall be wed
on the festival of Ramadan.

725
01:03:52,912 --> 01:03:55,372
It will be a great holiday.

726
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:58,875
Princes and merchants will come
from every corner of the world.

727
01:04:00,044 --> 01:04:04,798
They shall bring rich gifts
in token of their servitude.

728
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:15,433
You are a master of trickery,
Prince Cassim.

729
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:18,520
There are times when trickery
is more powerful than force.

730
01:04:18,646 --> 01:04:20,021
(Man chuckles)

731
01:04:31,158 --> 01:04:32,534
Leave me.

732
01:04:38,916 --> 01:04:40,792
The horses are ready, My Lady.

733
01:04:40,918 --> 01:04:42,627
I cannot go, Jamiel.

734
01:04:42,753 --> 01:04:45,839
But now that you know
who Ali Baba really is...

735
01:04:45,965 --> 01:04:47,883
I have given my word.

736
01:04:48,009 --> 01:04:51,344
Hulagu Khan would've killed
my father if I had not promised.

737
01:04:52,805 --> 01:04:55,515
I will marry him
at the feast of Ramadan.

738
01:04:56,601 --> 01:04:59,102
It will be a great holiday.

739
01:04:59,228 --> 01:05:02,188
But, My Lady, what of Ali Baba?

740
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:05,191
Go to him, Jamiel.

741
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:08,862
Tell him I, too, remember
the pledge we sealed with our blood.

742
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:14,618
If he had only told me who he was,
I would have stayed with him.

743
01:05:15,328 --> 01:05:16,995
He will come to your rescue, My Lady.

744
01:05:17,121 --> 01:05:18,538
No, he must not.

745
01:05:19,373 --> 01:05:21,458
It may mean disaster for him,

746
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:24,169
and failure to the cause
for which he fights.

747
01:05:25,379 --> 01:05:29,591
And you, Jamiel,
you must stay with him.

748
01:05:29,717 --> 01:05:32,969
Your heart is there. Go quickly.

749
01:05:53,574 --> 01:05:56,493
And the slave, Jamiel,
leaves the palace, My Lord.

750
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:59,037
But he has not had time
to reach the outer gates.

751
01:05:59,163 --> 01:06:02,123
You see, O Mighty Khan,
I'm still useful to you.

752
01:06:02,249 --> 01:06:04,542
Your little spy
has done well, Cassim.

753
01:06:04,669 --> 01:06:06,252
Return to your mistress.

754
01:06:08,422 --> 01:06:09,631
I will send soldiers, great Khan,

755
01:06:09,757 --> 01:06:11,466
to bring the treacherous slave
before you.

756
01:06:11,592 --> 01:06:14,386
Make no move to stop him.
Let him go to Ali Baba.

757
01:06:15,429 --> 01:06:16,763
The thieves will come to the rescue,

758
01:06:16,889 --> 01:06:19,933
but this time
they will fall into our trap.

759
01:06:40,788 --> 01:06:42,288
Jamiel!

760
01:06:43,624 --> 01:06:45,291
Tell me of your lady.

761
01:06:45,418 --> 01:06:47,752
She learned from Prince Cassim
who you are.

762
01:06:47,878 --> 01:06:50,880
She said to tell you that she, too,
remembers your pledge.

763
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:53,299
Then why does she marry the Khan?

764
01:06:53,426 --> 01:06:54,801
She thought you were dead.

765
01:06:54,927 --> 01:06:58,388
- But she does not love the Mongol.
- No. She refused to marry him.

766
01:06:58,514 --> 01:07:02,100
But when he tortured her father,
she gave her consent.

767
01:07:02,226 --> 01:07:03,268
I will go to her.

768
01:07:03,394 --> 01:07:05,520
Why all this fuss about one woman?

769
01:07:05,646 --> 01:07:09,315
For a thousand pieces of gold,
you can buy the best in the market.

770
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:13,987
A thousand pieces of gold?
I bid my life for Lady Amara.

771
01:07:14,113 --> 01:07:17,615
For a man's country or his stomach,
he might bid his life,

772
01:07:17,742 --> 01:07:18,908
even for his horse.

773
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:21,828
Never, never for a woman.

774
01:07:23,205 --> 01:07:26,166
I do not ask the life
of a single thief to save her.

775
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:29,127
But if I choose to give my own,
it is between me and Allah.

776
01:07:29,253 --> 01:07:30,378
(Jamiel) I will go with you.

777
01:07:30,504 --> 01:07:32,547
What, you two would storm
the walls of Baghdad

778
01:07:32,673 --> 01:07:34,799
and attack the Mongol armies
single-handed?

779
01:07:34,925 --> 01:07:37,427
You would break into the palace
and carry off the wench?

780
01:07:37,553 --> 01:07:39,929
What do you possess? A magic carpet?

781
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:42,390
- When will the wedding be held?
- At the feast of Ramadan.

782
01:07:42,516 --> 01:07:43,558
And for entertainment,

783
01:07:43,684 --> 01:07:45,602
they'll chop the two of you
into little bits.

784
01:07:45,728 --> 01:07:47,353
There will be many guests
at the wedding.

785
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:49,272
One more will pass unnoticed.

786
01:07:54,945 --> 01:07:57,238
Then there'll be forty more
than they bargained for.

787
01:07:57,364 --> 01:07:58,323
Good.

788
01:07:58,449 --> 01:08:00,617
This is the hour
for which we have waited.

789
01:08:00,743 --> 01:08:03,703
This shall be our day
of reckoning with the Mongols.

790
01:08:03,829 --> 01:08:05,955
You're right. This is our hour.

791
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:09,042
With a single cast of the dice,
we will free Baghdad

792
01:08:09,168 --> 01:08:10,960
or we will die together.

793
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:14,089
We must disguise ourselves
if we are to enter the palace.

794
01:08:14,715 --> 01:08:18,301
Children of camels,
offspring of donkeys,

795
01:08:18,427 --> 01:08:20,929
paint your foolish faces!

796
01:08:21,055 --> 01:08:24,390
Dress your ugly bodies
to deceive the Mongols!

797
01:08:24,517 --> 01:08:27,769
This time we enter the palace!

798
01:08:27,895 --> 01:08:29,854
(Cheering)

799
01:08:34,276 --> 01:08:36,236
You must return
to Baghdad ahead of us.

800
01:08:36,362 --> 01:08:38,321
As sentry within their gates,

801
01:08:38,447 --> 01:08:41,199
you'll be able to warn us
should the Mongols become suspicious.

802
01:08:41,325 --> 01:08:44,285
As Caliph of all Baghdad,
I bow to you.

803
01:08:45,371 --> 01:08:48,581
I kept that a secret
until it was time to strike.

804
01:08:48,707 --> 01:08:51,209
Now all of Baghdad shall know.

805
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:01,803
Abdullah, you'd be a favourite
in any harem!

806
01:09:23,534 --> 01:09:27,370
Who do you see, you ill-mannered,
insignificant little ape?

807
01:09:27,496 --> 01:09:29,372
Why, Abdullah, of course.

808
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:33,459
Now whom do you see?

809
01:09:33,586 --> 01:09:37,297
- Who am I supposed to see?
- I'm disguised.

810
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:43,720
Who are you?
You are a stranger among us.

811
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:47,056
Truly I have never
laid eyes on you before.

812
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:49,267
It's a wonderful disguise, isn't it?

813
01:09:50,394 --> 01:09:52,520
It is black magic.

814
01:09:55,941 --> 01:09:58,318
He has changed
from Abdullah the thief

815
01:09:58,444 --> 01:10:00,695
to Abdullah the thief in a turban!

816
01:10:11,332 --> 01:10:12,373
Wait!

817
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:17,003
We must find some other way.

818
01:10:17,129 --> 01:10:19,214
We will fool no one
with our disguises.

819
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:21,549
Even a blind Mongol would know us.

820
01:10:24,136 --> 01:10:27,764
If a rich merchant from Basra
were to attend the wedding,

821
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:31,434
it would be fitting he bring
a rich gift for the invader.

822
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:41,110
By the stars in heaven,
this is what we shall do.

823
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:43,446
We will assemble forty huge jars,

824
01:10:43,572 --> 01:10:46,532
large enough to carry
forty weights of fragrant oil,

825
01:10:46,659 --> 01:10:49,577
and large enough
to carry forty thieves.

826
01:11:04,843 --> 01:11:05,927
My Lady!

827
01:11:06,053 --> 01:11:08,012
(Gasping)

828
01:11:10,015 --> 01:11:11,975
Jamiel! You cannot come in here.

829
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:14,185
I must talk to Lady Amara. Quickly!

830
01:11:32,204 --> 01:11:33,579
Go, please.

831
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:42,088
Why have you returned
against my orders?

832
01:11:42,214 --> 01:11:43,339
Because of Ali Baba.

833
01:11:43,465 --> 01:11:45,383
He bids you have courage.
He will come.

834
01:11:45,509 --> 01:11:48,344
No, no, he must not!
He must not try to save me.

835
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:51,514
They will kill him.
The Mongols would welcome an attack.

836
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:54,726
Ali Baba is not such a fool
as to attack the city openly.

837
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:01,232
There will be wonderful wedding gifts
brought to Baghdad.

838
01:12:01,358 --> 01:12:05,069
Among them will be forty jars of oil
from a rich merchant.

839
01:12:20,085 --> 01:12:21,252
She was spying on you, My Lady.

840
01:12:21,378 --> 01:12:24,839
No, no! I came only
to bring My Lady's dress.

841
01:12:25,632 --> 01:12:27,425
We can trust her.

842
01:12:27,551 --> 01:12:32,055
If she heard our words,
she will lock them in her heart.

843
01:12:32,181 --> 01:12:33,890
I have heard nothing,

844
01:12:34,016 --> 01:12:36,517
but I would die
before I would betray you.

845
01:12:37,978 --> 01:12:39,479
It grows late.

846
01:13:05,214 --> 01:13:08,591
- (Whispers) Today Ali Baba comes.
- Ali Baba?

847
01:13:08,717 --> 01:13:09,884
Today.

848
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:14,263
- Ali Baba comes today.
- Ali Baba!

849
01:13:15,808 --> 01:13:17,892
Great Khan,
many guests enter the city

850
01:13:18,018 --> 01:13:19,936
bringing rich gifts
to win your favour.

851
01:13:21,063 --> 01:13:22,688
You must challenge everyone.

852
01:13:22,815 --> 01:13:26,150
Each caravan that enters
the city must be carefully watched.

853
01:13:26,276 --> 01:13:27,819
Take no chances.

854
01:13:27,945 --> 01:13:31,781
The thieves are certain to try
some trick to gain admittance.

855
01:13:31,907 --> 01:13:34,492
I have spies everywhere, Mighty One.

856
01:13:34,618 --> 01:13:38,371
We will know the plans of Ali Baba
almost as soon as he does himself.

857
01:13:38,497 --> 01:13:40,164
Good.

858
01:13:40,290 --> 01:13:45,128
This time he will receive
a welcome he did not bargain for.

859
01:13:57,933 --> 01:13:59,976
Gifts for the Mighty Khan.

860
01:14:02,771 --> 01:14:04,188
Pass on!

861
01:14:14,908 --> 01:14:18,244
If you love Baghdad,
wait for the signal,

862
01:14:18,370 --> 01:14:20,997
and strike down
the Mongols for Ali Baba.

863
01:14:30,924 --> 01:14:32,550
Whose caravan is this?

864
01:14:33,302 --> 01:14:35,011
It is mine.

865
01:14:35,137 --> 01:14:37,889
I am Abu Radi, merchant of Basra.

866
01:14:45,689 --> 01:14:47,648
What is inside the jars?

867
01:14:47,774 --> 01:14:49,942
Oil. Oil for the Khan.

868
01:14:59,828 --> 01:15:01,662
If he uncovers the jar, he dies.

869
01:15:05,042 --> 01:15:07,001
It is a gift to celebrate the wedding.

870
01:15:10,839 --> 01:15:12,173
Pass on!

871
01:15:34,279 --> 01:15:36,280
(Fanfare)

872
01:15:39,034 --> 01:15:42,787
O Mighty Khan,
Haidar, Prince of El Samrah!

873
01:16:17,489 --> 01:16:19,991
Precious sapphires and topaz.

874
01:16:20,701 --> 01:16:22,910
Garnets and bloodstone.

875
01:16:23,036 --> 01:16:25,621
Vases from the ancient
temple of Isis

876
01:16:25,747 --> 01:16:27,331
for Your Highness.

877
01:16:30,961 --> 01:16:32,712
(Fanfare)

878
01:16:35,674 --> 01:16:38,801
Abu Radi, merchant of Basra!

879
01:17:16,965 --> 01:17:18,716
I, a lowly merchant,

880
01:17:18,842 --> 01:17:21,135
do plead with the Mighty Khan
for the privilege of adding

881
01:17:21,261 --> 01:17:24,722
my humble offerings
to those of his noble guests.

882
01:17:24,848 --> 01:17:28,309
In all the land,
there is no finer oil.

883
01:17:36,485 --> 01:17:39,904
Oil for your lamps,
oil to cook your feasts.

884
01:17:40,864 --> 01:17:43,741
Fragrant oils
to please your senses.

885
01:18:01,885 --> 01:18:03,761
I have waited for this moment.

886
01:18:04,554 --> 01:18:09,725
My spies told me that the thieves
entered the city in forty large jars.

887
01:18:09,851 --> 01:18:13,145
This merchant from Basra is Ali Baba.

888
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:19,485
No, wait, O Mighty Khan.
I have prepared entertainment.

889
01:18:19,611 --> 01:18:22,571
It will amuse you to see
the fate that is awaiting them.

890
01:18:23,824 --> 01:18:26,575
Excellent, Cassim. Excellent!

891
01:18:26,702 --> 01:18:28,619
(Fanfare)

892
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:32,665
Sada Gen, Chief of the Tartars!

893
01:19:01,236 --> 01:19:03,028
Come here.

894
01:19:20,881 --> 01:19:22,965
(Khan) Rubies, blood red,

895
01:19:23,091 --> 01:19:26,510
for the people of Baghdad
who stood in my way.

896
01:19:28,764 --> 01:19:32,475
And now, for your pleasure,
a most unusual bit of entertainment.

897
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:34,477
(Fanfare)

898
01:21:36,433 --> 01:21:38,517
What is the meaning of this grim jest?

899
01:21:38,643 --> 01:21:40,269
Seize him.

900
01:22:13,887 --> 01:22:20,142
Sand!

901
01:22:31,613 --> 01:22:34,698
Your spies discovered our plans,
and we discovered your spies.

902
01:22:36,076 --> 01:22:37,993
You have failed me.

903
01:22:41,331 --> 01:22:42,706
(Screams)

904
01:22:58,682 --> 01:23:00,683
You are my honoured guest.

905
01:23:00,809 --> 01:23:03,894
Now there will be entertainment
befitting your rank.

906
01:23:04,020 --> 01:23:07,773
You shall not die as a humble thief,

907
01:23:07,899 --> 01:23:10,109
but with all the honour
to which you are entitled.

908
01:23:10,235 --> 01:23:13,195
You will live through a thousand tortures.

909
01:23:13,321 --> 01:23:16,156
And you will pray
for the release of death!

910
01:23:18,118 --> 01:23:19,576
(Screaming)

911
01:23:33,425 --> 01:23:35,342
(Horn blares)

912
01:23:35,468 --> 01:23:38,762
On to the palace!
On to the palace!

913
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:31,774
Quickly! Come with me!

914
01:24:43,244 --> 01:24:45,037
(Shouting)

915
01:24:49,793 --> 01:24:51,835
(Banging)

916
01:24:51,961 --> 01:24:54,922
Open the gates, Amara,
for your people.

917
01:26:21,009 --> 01:26:22,885
Still the nursemaid.
