00:02:00,913 --> 00:02:04,166
- Lula loves her syrup.
- You have enough syrup.

2
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:06,919
Mrs. Butterworths
isn't a squirt bottle.

3
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:08,962
It's no big deal. You've had enough.

4
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:12,341
- Mom, these aren't brown enough.
- Do you want me to burn them?

5
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:14,760
No, but I just want them more brown.

6
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:17,304
Mikey, Mom's not a short order cook.

7
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:18,889
Eat up now.

8
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:23,185
Double knots?
We never did double knots.

9
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:26,230
- Sweetie, I can't get it.
- Don't use a fork.

10
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,982
No bubbles at the table.
Eat your breakfast first.

11
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:31,944
She's right, you know,
my eggs taste like bubbles now.

12
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:40,786
- Hurry up, honey, you'll be late.
- All right.

13
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:44,289
The van needs an inspection sticker.
Good luck.

14
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,338
Alrighty.

15
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,966
What's this?
Look who's hiding.

16
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:58,470
Mr. Dino...
and another weird stowaway.

17
00:02:58,554 --> 00:03:00,639
Okay, Nathan, no cereal in my thingie.

18
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:02,474
- Bye, sweetheart.
- Bye, honey.

19
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:03,725
Nathan!

20
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:39,845
- What's that?
- What?

21
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,096
That.

22
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,725
Maple syrup.

23
00:03:48,187 --> 00:03:52,566
Mmm, man! Can you believe
that comes from a tree?

24
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,359
Don't taste my pants.

25
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,195
I can't taste your pants?

26
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,030
Ever.

27
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,364
- Ever?
- No.

28
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:01,700
Well, don't spill maple syrup on them.

29
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:04,536
Just because it's there
doesn't mean you have to taste it.

30
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:06,663
- I like maple syrup.
- Not from my pants.

31
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,207
I love it.

32
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:15,339
How about this:
What if you had, like, an inkpad...

33
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:20,719
only instead of ink,
it was soaked in maple syrup.

34
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:23,263
Or peppermint.
Any flavor you wanted.

35
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:30,187
- And you just open up your little pad.
- Right.

36
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,857
And you press your finger on it
and then you taste your finger.

37
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:38,195
Peppermint. Any time of day.
Or cherry.

38
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:41,198
Wouldn't the pad get disgusting
after awhile?

39
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,741
Disgusting how?

40
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:45,744
I don't know. You keep touching it
with your filthy fingers.

41
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:49,581
Couple of days that flavor pad's like
some mattress you find at the dump.

42
00:04:50,374 --> 00:04:52,751
You're right. It's no good.

43
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:01,760
Tim.

44
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:05,347
- Did you get your performance chart?
- Yeah.

45
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,267
Well, look at mine. I don't get it.

46
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,394
Good. Fair. Fair. Good.

47
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:13,188
Then it falls into the red
in the focus department.

48
00:05:13,272 --> 00:05:16,984
Well, you know, Nick, that's because
you're a dreamer. You know?

49
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:21,154
- I'm not a dreamer.
- You're not the most focused person.

50
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:22,823
You're a dreamer.

51
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:26,243
Yeah. I'm a dreamer?

52
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:29,162
Hey, you want to feel something?
Come here.

53
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:31,248
Sit in this chair. Come here.

54
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,292
Okay.

55
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,793
Check this out.

56
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:38,839
Whoa.

57
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:41,425
- Sit back.
- Oh, this is some chair!

58
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:42,926
- Do you like it?
- Yeah.

59
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:44,511
Feel this.

60
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:47,347
What is that?

61
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:49,975
- Lumbar support.
- That is good.

62
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:54,271
- It's made especially for your spine.
- I like it.

63
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:57,232
Comes with the office.
And the promotion.

64
00:05:57,316 --> 00:06:00,527
- Right.
- Thinking of buying a swimming pool?

65
00:06:00,611 --> 00:06:02,321
- What, are you kidding?
- I am.

66
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:05,324
- Thinking bean-shaped.

67
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:08,827
Expensive. Bean-shaped?

68
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,957
Take a look at my performance chart.

69
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:17,836
Look at your focus. It's way up there.
It's in the yellow.

70
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:21,965
I'm telling you, you get your focus
even into the orange, just the orange...

71
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:24,301
I guarantee you can have
a chair like that.

72
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:26,220
- Really?
- And an office like this.

73
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,847
And a piano-shaped pool
if that's what you want.

74
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:31,725
It's all there for you.
All you got to do is focus.

75
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,435
Just work a little bit harder.

76
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:37,356
You can get bumped up to sandpaper
with me and the world opens up.

77
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,609
You know what, man?
You could really sack out in this thing.

78
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:44,071
I'm telling you, your numbers
aren't that bad. It's just focus.

79
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:48,492
If you put together everything else, you
got a really strong thing going on...

80
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:53,664
Nick. Nick!

81
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,960
- I got to get back to work.
- Yeah.

82
00:06:58,043 --> 00:06:59,878
- Good talk.
- Yeah, good talk.

83
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:03,173
- Remember what I said.
- Focus.

84
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:05,551
- Just get into orange.
- That's all I need.

85
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:08,053
Don't even worry about yellow,
just orange.

86
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:17,563
Do you ever just watch your hand?

87
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,022
No.

88
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:21,275
I was just looking at my hand today.

89
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:25,112
It was like a separate thing.

90
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:26,446
It was...

91
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:30,242
picking up papers.

92
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:34,496
It tapped on my desk.
It sat in my lap.

93
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,082
- It's like...
- Sorry.

94
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:39,418
It's like a...

95
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:41,170
It's like a sidekick.

96
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:44,423
My little ugly sidekick.
It was very odd.

97
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:04,610
Eww.

98
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:06,862
- Oh, oh!
- What?

99
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:09,531
- Oh!
- What?!

100
00:08:09,615 --> 00:08:11,116
How about this?

101
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:15,245
A spray can, see?
And you spray it on dog poo...

102
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:18,123
and the poo disappears.

103
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:20,083
- Disappears?
- Yes!

104
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,127
Where does it go?

105
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:24,171
Who knows? But the thing is...

106
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:27,257
you come up with something
that gets rid of dog turds,

107
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:30,636
you are home free, my friend.
Home free.

108
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:47,861
What?

109
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:49,363
Nothing.

110
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:53,116
Liposuction.

111
00:08:55,953 --> 00:08:58,247
You mean, where they suck the fat out?

112
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,415
There's a thing about it in here.

113
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:03,126
You're fine. You don't need
to get fat sucked out.

114
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:06,505
- If we had a little extra money...
- We don't have extra money.

115
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:08,882
- We have a little.
- Not to get fat sucked out.

116
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:13,637
Hello?

117
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:17,224
- Timmy. Timmy, check this out.
- What?

118
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:20,185
You know that invention of mine
that makes turds disappear?

119
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:23,272
I got a name for it.

120
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:25,399
Vapoorize.

121
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:29,862
Just like vaporize only you add an "o"
so you got "poo" right in the middle.

122
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:31,321
Yeah, I get it.

123
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:34,700
Do you see how perfect it is?
Maybe even underline the poo.

124
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,368
Va-poo-rize.

125
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:38,370
- All right.
- Vapoorize.

126
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:40,038
Goodbye.

127
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:41,874
- Nick?
- Mmm-hmm.

128
00:09:41,957 --> 00:09:44,293
- What did he want?
- Nothing.

129
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:47,546
Vapoorize.

130
00:09:49,882 --> 00:09:53,218
Next up, ladies
and gentlemen, Nathan Vanderpark.

131
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:56,889
- Go ahead, Nathan.
- All right.

132
00:09:56,972 --> 00:10:00,267
- Here we go, Nathan. Here we go.

133
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:04,062
- Almost.
- All right.

134
00:10:04,563 --> 00:10:07,065
- Nice try.
- All right, Nathan, let's...

135
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:09,484
Close one.

136
00:10:09,568 --> 00:10:12,529
Oh! Come... all right.

137
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:14,239
That's enough. Hey!

138
00:10:14,323 --> 00:10:16,116
Almost.

139
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,328
- We'll get them next time, no problem.
- Good job.

140
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:21,455
You know Dimitriov in research?

141
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:23,832
- Dimitriov?
- Yeah.

142
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:28,295
- Kind of big beard? Kind of strange?
- No.

143
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:30,839
- I told him about my invention.
- What invention?

144
00:10:30,923 --> 00:10:32,299
Vapoorize!

145
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:34,510
Nick, you got a cute name, that's it.

146
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:37,930
It's not an invention. It's an idea.
It's nothing.

147
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:41,016
Not according to Dimitriov.
He thinks I'm really on to something.

148
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,077
- Bravo!
- Good stuff.

149
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:02,287
- Good job.
- Good stuff.

150
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:06,291
You know what? I love this tent.
There's not one bug.

151
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,668
Guess what?

152
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:10,379
I went over to Dimitriov's
a couple nights ago.

153
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:12,422
We ran some experiments in his sink.

154
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:15,259
- He's having a ball with this thing.
- What thing?

155
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,302
You didn't tell Debbie
about my invention?

156
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:20,347
No, sorry, I didn't.
Go ahead. This is great.

157
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,100
Check it out.
It's a spray can, okay?

158
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:25,102
And you spray it on dog poo...

159
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:27,938
and the poo disappears.

160
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:32,442
That is an awesome invention.
I mean, we could sure use it.

161
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:36,488
It's not an invention. It's nothing.
I mean, how does it work?

162
00:11:36,572 --> 00:11:40,075
It's a spray can and you spray it on.

163
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:42,327
- Exactly.
- Right?

164
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:44,538
Yeah, I know.
But what makes it disappear?

165
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:46,331
Things don't just disappear.

166
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:49,126
I don't know, honey.
How does anything work?

167
00:11:49,168 --> 00:11:52,462
How does electricity work?
I think it's a great idea.

168
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:55,090
So do l. I think it's really exciting.

169
00:11:55,174 --> 00:11:57,176
- You're nuts.

170
00:11:57,259 --> 00:11:58,677
Dessert, everybody?

171
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,138
- I'm nuts. I'm crazy.
- You're crazy!

172
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:04,266
Hey, I have an invention.
Honey, I have an invention.

173
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:08,228
It's this button you press and
you sprout wings and you can fly.

174
00:12:08,312 --> 00:12:11,857
You can fly into outer space,
to the moon, to Jupiter if you like.

175
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:21,325
He's doing so well.

176
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:23,535
He's not doing anything.

177
00:12:23,619 --> 00:12:27,080
- Does he have any lines?
- No, honey, he's a tree.

178
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:30,417
Three months of rehearsal.

179
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:36,673
Dimitriov wants to know
if I want to take it to the next level.

180
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:39,843
Four thousand bucks.
You want to go in with me, 50/50?

181
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:43,597
I pray to God
you're kidding.

182
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,390
- Your invention?
- Yeah.

183
00:12:45,474 --> 00:12:49,561
We've been working with dry ice.
We've got something amazing.

184
00:12:49,645 --> 00:12:50,896
Nick, forget it.

185
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:55,567
No, wait a minute. $2,000.
We have that in our savings.

186
00:12:55,651 --> 00:12:56,860
Who knows?

187
00:12:56,902 --> 00:13:00,072
Shit doesn't just disappear.

188
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:01,865
It has to go somewhere.

189
00:13:01,907 --> 00:13:06,870
And it's not an invention, it's an idea.
It's a pie in the sky idea.

190
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:09,164
And I'll tell you,
as your best friend...

191
00:13:09,248 --> 00:13:12,668
I think you should
just pull out right now.

192
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:15,546
Don't waste your money.
You're gonna regret it.

193
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:17,047
"It's pie in the sky."

194
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:23,136
Where are the kids?
What's happening?

195
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,097
Honey?

196
00:13:28,267 --> 00:13:30,769
I have champagne glasses, too.

197
00:13:30,853 --> 00:13:32,312
All right!

198
00:13:32,396 --> 00:13:33,856
What's happening?

199
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:37,693
Okay, let me get it for you.
I'll do everything.

200
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:41,738
You just stay there and just relax
and get ready for the big stuff.

201
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,741
- We got it.

202
00:13:44,783 --> 00:13:46,159
- Exciting.
- Watch this.

203
00:13:46,243 --> 00:13:49,955
I'm so glad you guys are here!
This is Dimitriov.

204
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:52,791
- Meet our best friends in the universe.
- How do you do?

205
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:55,627
Give Tim the flash, Big D.

206
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:57,421
Okay. Here, take it.

207
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:58,630
Goggles.

208
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:02,259
Shine it right on her, buddy boy.

209
00:14:02,301 --> 00:14:03,927
"Her"?

210
00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:27,284
- You told me it would work and it did!
- Did you see that?!

211
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:30,495
It works.
It works like a charm.

212
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:38,003
Did you guys see that?

213
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:41,131
Get a camera.
There's nothing to shoot!

214
00:14:41,215 --> 00:14:46,053
Spray some on my butt
because I shat my pants. Yeah!

215
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:49,932
We are going to be so rich, Dimitriov!

216
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:52,142
Vapoorize!

217
00:14:56,188 --> 00:14:58,357
God, we are going
to be so rich!

218
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,822
No matter what kind of dog you have,
let's face it,

219
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:07,741
they all gotta do their "business."

220
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,660
Vapoorize!

221
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:11,036
That's right!

222
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:13,872
One spray: Problem solved.

223
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:15,666
Is this some kind of video trick?

224
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:17,042
No.

225
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:20,003
It's the miracle spray.
One spray and doggy doo disappears.

226
00:15:20,045 --> 00:15:23,048
No fuss, no muss, no tools,
no robot arm...

227
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:25,300
"How do I work it? I don't know!"

228
00:15:25,384 --> 00:15:27,386
- Too good to be true?
- No!

229
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:29,721
Because life is tough enough.

230
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:31,431
Now at stores everywhere.

231
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:31,723
Now at stores everywhere.

232
00:16:17,728 --> 00:16:20,272
Now's a good time
to break the big news.

233
00:16:22,316 --> 00:16:27,279
I have decided to run for Congress.

234
00:16:27,362 --> 00:16:28,780
Congress.

235
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:32,117
No, I'm serious.

236
00:16:32,201 --> 00:16:36,663
Yeah. I mean, not the big Congress,
of course, the little one.

237
00:16:36,747 --> 00:16:39,625
- "The little one."
- "The little one?"

238
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:43,545
Yeah. Actually, it might be
the state senate. I can't remember.

239
00:16:43,629 --> 00:16:46,089
Anyway, I'm super excited...

240
00:16:46,131 --> 00:16:48,759
because we are so lucky...

241
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:52,179
and we have so, so, so much.

242
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:54,765
And I feel like
we should give something back.

243
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:57,684
So, I've decided
I'm going to run for Congress

244
00:16:57,768 --> 00:17:00,062
or state senate or whatever.

245
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:04,149
And my main platform...

246
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:06,276
is going to be...

247
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:09,530
the environment.

248
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:13,951
State senate.

249
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:16,828
Environment, like the whole environment?

250
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:21,583
Yeah. I believe in all environments
and I'm going to say it.

251
00:17:22,835 --> 00:17:25,838
And now for dessert.

252
00:17:25,921 --> 00:17:27,965
Flan!

253
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:30,676
- Flan! Oh, boy!
- Whoo!

254
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:34,805
- Come on, kids, flan time!
- Get down here, the flan's here!

255
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:36,890
Flan, kids! Flan!

256
00:17:36,974 --> 00:17:38,559
I love flan. Do you?

257
00:17:38,642 --> 00:17:39,893
What is flan?

258
00:17:39,977 --> 00:17:42,062
My God, you're in for such a treat.

259
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:45,190
- You don't know flan?
- Eat your flan, buddy. Kids, flan!

260
00:17:45,274 --> 00:17:48,527
- Guys, flan's on the table!
- Flan!

261
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:49,862
Flan! Flan!

262
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:53,490
Flan! Yay, flan! Flan!

263
00:17:53,574 --> 00:17:55,367
What's flan?

264
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:58,245
"Jasper and Amos
shine the flashlight into the hole.

265
00:17:58,328 --> 00:18:02,833
"Staring up at them, tied and gagged,
was Louie the Grouch."

266
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,377
It's getting exciting, isn't it?

267
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:08,505
Boy, that flan was good.

268
00:18:08,547 --> 00:18:10,132
I wish we had flan.

269
00:18:18,223 --> 00:18:19,266
Dad?

270
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:21,018
Yeah?

271
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:23,437
Why are we getting the little,
itty-bitty pool?

272
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,980
It's not a little itty-bitty.

273
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:28,942
The square one's little itty-bitty.
We're getting the bean-shaped model.

274
00:18:29,026 --> 00:18:30,861
A little itty-bitty bean.

275
00:18:30,903 --> 00:18:35,115
It's not a little, itty-bitty bean.
It's an average-sized bean, Mikey.

276
00:18:35,199 --> 00:18:36,658
And I got news for you.

277
00:18:36,742 --> 00:18:40,787
There are kids in the world
who'd walk 50 miles through quicksand

278
00:18:40,871 --> 00:18:43,540
just to stick a toe in your pool.

279
00:18:43,582 --> 00:18:46,418
And I got news for you about beans too.

280
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:50,380
Some kids'd eat beans because they've
had nothing to eat their whole life,

281
00:18:50,422 --> 00:18:52,424
but leaves and bark and roots.

282
00:18:52,508 --> 00:18:56,553
And I guarantee you, none of them has
ever heard of your big, show-off flan,

283
00:18:56,637 --> 00:19:01,642
or flan or whatever you want to call it
that you got to have every night.

284
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:10,275
Two thousand dollars.
That's all it would've taken.

285
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:13,695
- It's okay, honey.
- Dad's just having a meltdown.

286
00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:16,031
Good night. Sleep tight.

287
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:16,782
- I don't like English muffins.
- Eat your cereal.

288
00:19:16,782 --> 00:19:19,117
- I don't like English muffins.
- Eat your cereal.

289
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:21,745
- Try different breakfast foods.
- I like pancakes.

290
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:24,623
- Tomorrow we'll have pancakes.
- Fine.

291
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,922
I don't want any more cereal.

292
00:19:31,964 --> 00:19:35,050
Eat up, otherwise you don't
get to play with Corky, okay?

293
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:42,599
- What?
- Nothing.

294
00:19:43,433 --> 00:19:45,310
Why are you always asking "what"?

295
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:47,688
- I'm not always asking "what."
- Yes, you are.

296
00:19:47,771 --> 00:19:49,314
It's true, Dad, you are.

297
00:19:49,398 --> 00:19:51,859
Well, because I know there's something.

298
00:19:51,942 --> 00:19:56,363
- And you know exactly what it is.
- Then why do you always say "nothing"?

299
00:19:56,446 --> 00:19:58,824
- Corky!
- Hold Lula's hand, honey.

300
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:04,329
- Corky!

301
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:05,998
So beautiful.

302
00:20:06,081 --> 00:20:08,500
Such a great horse, Corky.

303
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:10,627
Who's a good boy?

304
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:14,798
Corky's a sweet and gentle horse
and me and the kids love him.

305
00:20:14,882 --> 00:20:17,968
Corky happens to shit
the size of a breadbasket

306
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:21,054
in our yard every day
when he comes to visit.

307
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,555
What are you doing?

308
00:21:03,639 --> 00:21:06,225
Nothing. Nothing at all.

309
00:21:06,308 --> 00:21:12,105
I'm just throwing away some more
completely useless inventions.

310
00:21:13,815 --> 00:21:16,693
For chrissakes, Debbie, light?
Light?! Come on!

311
00:21:16,735 --> 00:21:19,071
Come on! This was shit.

312
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:23,075
You think Edison would've looked up
from his workbench at some shit spray?

313
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:25,077
Yes. Yes, I do.

314
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:28,539
Because, you see, a good invention
is a good invention!

315
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:31,458
I got news for you, sister.
Edison ain't looking up.

316
00:21:31,542 --> 00:21:34,878
Sister. Sister?!

317
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,296
I'm calling you sister.

318
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,966
You should be so lucky
to be my sister.

319
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:40,884
She knows what she's talking about.

320
00:21:40,926 --> 00:21:42,761
Windtalker, or whatever her name is.

321
00:21:42,845 --> 00:21:47,349
- Do not call her that. It's Windsong.
- Windsong. My mistake. Windsong.

322
00:21:47,432 --> 00:21:47,850
Knockety, knockety.
A-knock, knock, knock.

323
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:50,269
Knockety, knockety.
A-knock, knock, knock.

324
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:53,397
How's everybody doing?

325
00:21:57,818 --> 00:21:59,570
What a day, right?

326
00:21:59,611 --> 00:22:02,406
My God! Can you believe
the coffee that makes?

327
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:05,200
I knew you'd love it.
Let's go, tiger.

328
00:22:08,745 --> 00:22:11,957
Look who's here, will you please?

329
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:14,918
Look who's here. It's okay, poopie.

330
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,088
Have you been stealing apples again,
you little rascal?

331
00:22:18,172 --> 00:22:21,592
Listen, and I want you to be honest,
has Corky become a nuisance?

332
00:22:21,633 --> 00:22:22,968
- No.
- Not one bit.

333
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:25,262
Natalie says, "Keep the corral closed."

334
00:22:25,304 --> 00:22:28,640
But Corky's so crazy about your apples,
I don't know what to do.

335
00:22:28,724 --> 00:22:31,059
No more apples for you.
No more apples...

336
00:22:31,143 --> 00:22:35,105
I can't stop him. He loves your apples.
Are you sure he's not a problem?

337
00:22:35,147 --> 00:22:37,482
- Positive.
- You guys are so fantastic.

338
00:22:37,524 --> 00:22:40,402
Well, my buddy boy,
let's go shoot us some golf.

339
00:22:40,402 --> 00:22:40,819
Well, my buddy boy,
let's go shoot us some golf.

340
00:22:56,543 --> 00:22:58,921
I got something for you.
I'll be right back.

341
00:22:59,004 --> 00:23:01,590
- Nick, no. Please.
- Yes. You'll love it.

342
00:23:01,673 --> 00:23:04,009
You don't have to get me anything else.

343
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:13,477
When I hit it big,

344
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:17,105
everyone said I should buy a house
in Beverly Hills, Bel Air or Malibu.

345
00:23:17,189 --> 00:23:19,983
"Why you spending money
on a mansion in the Valley?"

346
00:23:20,025 --> 00:23:24,154
But I love my neighborhood, and being
across the street from my best friend.

347
00:23:24,238 --> 00:23:27,199
Do you see how it moves in the wind?
That's what I love.

348
00:23:28,867 --> 00:23:32,496
It flaps different than cheaper fabric.
Do you notice that?

349
00:23:33,664 --> 00:23:35,874
- Yeah.
- And it makes you feel better.

350
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:40,838
Nice fabric makes you feel better!
It's mind-blowing, isn't it?

351
00:23:40,879 --> 00:23:43,215
Nick, you buy us too much.

352
00:23:43,298 --> 00:23:47,719
Too much?! You're my best friend.
Nice things make life nicer.

353
00:23:49,638 --> 00:23:53,058
All right, let's take another look
at that follow-through.

354
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,020
I want the head down.

355
00:24:00,357 --> 00:24:01,733
That is nice, Nicky.

356
00:24:01,817 --> 00:24:03,861
- Right?
- Very nice.

357
00:24:03,902 --> 00:24:06,613
God Almighty, Mr. Dingman.

358
00:24:06,697 --> 00:24:09,366
Nick? Can I talk to you for a second?

359
00:24:12,077 --> 00:24:13,620
Just take a second.

360
00:24:15,747 --> 00:24:18,250
Can't it just be us?
You and me playing golf?

361
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:20,377
It's just, this is costing a fortune.

362
00:24:20,419 --> 00:24:23,130
Cut it out with this money thing.
It means nothing to me.

363
00:24:23,213 --> 00:24:24,464
Let's just enjoy it.

364
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,218
Why can't you come with us?

365
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,095
Because Daddy has to go to work.

366
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:32,598
You'll have a great time
at Aunt Nancy's.

367
00:24:32,681 --> 00:24:35,559
Aunt Windsong, and you know that.

368
00:24:36,393 --> 00:24:38,478
It's Aunt Windsong now.

369
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:47,237
Honey, you don't have to do this.
Really. Why do this?

370
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:51,200
Because I have to do this.
We have to do this.

371
00:24:51,283 --> 00:24:53,243
Something has to change.

372
00:24:53,285 --> 00:24:56,288
I can't look at you,
I can't look across the street.

373
00:24:56,371 --> 00:24:58,624
I'm running out of places to look.

374
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:02,461
The pool people
come tomorrow.

375
00:25:15,724 --> 00:25:18,644
Just wait and see this, Dad.

376
00:25:21,813 --> 00:25:23,774
Whoa! You the man.

377
00:25:23,857 --> 00:25:25,651
- You're the man.
- Yeah!

378
00:25:59,935 --> 00:26:02,020
Hey, Timmy, check this out!

379
00:26:02,104 --> 00:26:03,522
Yeah!

380
00:26:03,564 --> 00:26:05,983
Yah! Yah!

381
00:26:10,445 --> 00:26:12,114
Yah!

382
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:18,537
Mr. Dingman!

383
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:21,415
Mr. Parmenter wants to see you!
Section 1 1!

384
00:26:22,541 --> 00:26:25,502
You wanted to see me?

385
00:26:25,544 --> 00:26:27,629
You all right?

386
00:26:27,713 --> 00:26:28,755
What?

387
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:31,133
You seem distracted!

388
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:33,385
- What?
- Come on!

389
00:26:33,468 --> 00:26:36,513
Your performance chart's
pretty good until here.

390
00:26:36,597 --> 00:26:39,933
And then your focus
nosedives into the red.

391
00:26:40,017 --> 00:26:41,768
You see?

392
00:26:41,852 --> 00:26:46,106
Now, is there anything that happened
around here...

393
00:26:47,608 --> 00:26:50,277
you might like to talk about?

394
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,486
No.

395
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:53,697
- You sure?
- Yeah. No.

396
00:26:54,907 --> 00:26:56,533
Any reason?

397
00:26:56,617 --> 00:26:58,577
Reason? No, I can't think of...

398
00:26:58,619 --> 00:27:02,289
Any reason at all?

399
00:27:02,372 --> 00:27:07,377
No. No reason. No.
I mean, nothing I can think of.

400
00:27:07,461 --> 00:27:09,338
I mean...

401
00:27:09,421 --> 00:27:13,550
you know, other than every day
I get into my little shit-box car

402
00:27:13,634 --> 00:27:17,221
and there he is,
with the wind in his hair...

403
00:27:17,304 --> 00:27:19,765
on his great big shiny horse.

404
00:27:19,848 --> 00:27:24,394
And I drive off to do what?
To make sandpaper.

405
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:28,482
To make paper with sand on it.

406
00:27:30,692 --> 00:27:34,655
I'd love to see you try to turn your
weasely little mouth into a fake smile,

407
00:27:34,738 --> 00:27:36,657
day after day after day...

408
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:39,618
while waving toodly-fucking-do
to your best friend,

409
00:27:39,701 --> 00:27:43,330
who's rearing up on a big white horse
like he's the Lone Ranger.

410
00:27:43,413 --> 00:27:45,916
Then I'd like to see
your performance chart,

411
00:27:45,958 --> 00:27:48,794
you beady-eyed
little shrimp-boat bastard!

412
00:27:50,963 --> 00:27:53,090
Is that a reason?

413
00:27:56,802 --> 00:28:00,138
I mean, is that a reason?

414
00:28:20,659 --> 00:28:22,327
Hi.

415
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:27,708
I don't really drink,
but my family just left me

416
00:28:27,791 --> 00:28:30,919
and I got fired and I want a drink.

417
00:28:31,003 --> 00:28:36,341
So, if you could just give me whatever
you'd have if you wanted to drink.

418
00:28:37,676 --> 00:28:39,052
Please.

419
00:28:44,391 --> 00:28:45,851
Harsh.

420
00:28:48,854 --> 00:28:50,522
Abandoned.

421
00:28:50,856 --> 00:28:52,941
Fired.

422
00:28:55,027 --> 00:28:57,362
It's harsh, man.

423
00:29:00,532 --> 00:29:04,203
Know what the best job
I ever got fired from was?

424
00:29:07,706 --> 00:29:10,042
Pretzel kiosk.

425
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:13,962
Afternoon shift. Just loved it,
don't know why, just did.

426
00:29:14,046 --> 00:29:16,381
Could be the apron, who the hell knows?

427
00:29:16,465 --> 00:29:19,593
Or maybe the feeling of power you get
when there's a crowd.

428
00:29:19,676 --> 00:29:22,221
One hand rolls dough,
ties those babies off.

429
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:27,559
The other hand maybe works the soda,
refills the mustard. It's quite a thing.

430
00:29:27,643 --> 00:29:29,186
I'll tell you a secret.

431
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:32,606
If a pretzel is a quality pretzel,
you don't need salt.

432
00:29:32,689 --> 00:29:34,358
It's just a fact.

433
00:29:41,114 --> 00:29:42,533
How come?

434
00:29:43,325 --> 00:29:46,453
Your family up
and blew out of town on you?

435
00:29:47,913 --> 00:29:51,166
Thank you, but I don't really feel like
talking about it right now.

436
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:53,877
- Thank you.
- Okay.

437
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:56,672
So, how come you got canned?

438
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:01,009
It's a whole different topic.

439
00:30:02,177 --> 00:30:04,096
I just blew up.

440
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:08,600
Good for you, man. Good for you.
Good for you.

441
00:30:09,434 --> 00:30:12,271
- Who at?
- I blew up at my boss.

442
00:30:12,312 --> 00:30:15,023
Right on, brother. I hear you.

443
00:30:15,107 --> 00:30:17,526
Man, I hear you!

444
00:30:17,609 --> 00:30:20,779
What'd you go and blow up
at your boss for?

445
00:30:21,446 --> 00:30:26,410
You know, it's like
a long, complicated story.

446
00:30:26,451 --> 00:30:30,622
Well, that is sensational.
I'm the J-Man, by the way.

447
00:30:31,915 --> 00:30:33,417
- Tim.
- Tim.

448
00:30:33,458 --> 00:30:35,127
Ike.

449
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:37,129
Another round, please.

450
00:30:37,171 --> 00:30:40,424
Something fruity
for me and my friend, Tim.

451
00:30:40,465 --> 00:30:42,426
On the J-Man.

452
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:45,470
Okay, Tim...

453
00:30:45,971 --> 00:30:49,808
just let it tumble out
like circus freaks, man.

454
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:51,560
I'm here for you.

455
00:30:51,643 --> 00:30:54,354
The J-Man is zeroed in, okay?

456
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,773
Go.

457
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:00,736
Go.

458
00:31:00,819 --> 00:31:04,615
Well, I have this friend.
He's my best friend.

459
00:31:04,656 --> 00:31:07,367
I love the guy.
I mean, it's like we're, you know...

460
00:31:07,451 --> 00:31:10,454
Our families do everything together.

461
00:31:10,495 --> 00:31:13,665
- Used to go to work together every day.
- Keep it coming.

462
00:31:13,749 --> 00:31:16,210
And he'd have these stupid...

463
00:31:16,293 --> 00:31:18,670
He'd have these stupid ideas.

464
00:31:18,712 --> 00:31:20,797
Open your heart. Open your heart.

465
00:31:20,881 --> 00:31:23,133
Where does it come from?

466
00:31:23,175 --> 00:31:24,801
Shit.

467
00:31:24,843 --> 00:31:26,470
It's all from shit.

468
00:31:26,553 --> 00:31:29,515
You know who you are?
You're like that guy...

469
00:31:29,598 --> 00:31:31,850
Che, Che something.

470
00:31:31,934 --> 00:31:36,104
- "Che something"?
- Up with the people. People power.

471
00:31:36,188 --> 00:31:39,274
Or the kid that stole a chicken
with the golden eggs.

472
00:31:39,358 --> 00:31:40,984
What a fantastic chicken.

473
00:31:41,026 --> 00:31:44,196
Who's for the giant? Nobody.
You hear what I'm saying.

474
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:45,822
You're the hero.

475
00:31:45,906 --> 00:31:48,200
Forget Che! You're like Robin Hood.

476
00:31:48,283 --> 00:31:50,577
- Robin Hood? Really?
- Listen to me.

477
00:31:50,661 --> 00:31:54,248
Listen to me. Life's unfair.
It's a raw deal planet, Jack.

478
00:31:54,331 --> 00:31:57,000
You, my little dumbbell friend,
are Mr. Everyman

479
00:31:57,042 --> 00:32:01,171
and you don't even know it, which makes
you like the grand turbo Mr. Everyman.

480
00:32:01,255 --> 00:32:02,631
Honestly?

481
00:32:02,714 --> 00:32:04,007
Come on.

482
00:32:04,049 --> 00:32:07,177
You're like a great big dimwit.
You know that. Fantastic.

483
00:32:07,261 --> 00:32:08,762
Everyman Dimwit.

484
00:32:08,846 --> 00:32:12,516
That stinking family across the street.
Who wouldn't feel like you?

485
00:32:15,185 --> 00:32:18,230
I like you.
I'm glad I came in here.

486
00:32:18,313 --> 00:32:19,731
You know that?

487
00:32:19,773 --> 00:32:23,402
Ringlets! Give me a break.
Let me tell you a little story.

488
00:32:23,485 --> 00:32:25,028
When I was maybe 1 0,

489
00:32:25,112 --> 00:32:29,658
there was this kid across the street,
Ernie "Nice Kid."

490
00:32:29,741 --> 00:32:33,871
Ernie had everything.
Only kid around with a BB gun, okay?

491
00:32:33,912 --> 00:32:36,957
So one night I see
the whole family drive off.

492
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:41,295
What'd I do? I sneak across the street
and find the BB gun.

493
00:32:41,378 --> 00:32:45,841
I squeeze off maybe five, ten pot shots
at the windows...

494
00:32:45,924 --> 00:32:47,759
Hello. In my house.

495
00:32:47,801 --> 00:32:51,054
- In your house?
- Yes, you got...

496
00:32:51,096 --> 00:32:52,931
You squoze off to your house?

497
00:32:52,973 --> 00:32:55,434
You got it.
Next morning my old man gets up,

498
00:32:55,517 --> 00:32:59,229
sees all these little BB holes
in our windows.

499
00:32:59,271 --> 00:33:02,566
He marches across the street,
bangs on the door and Tim,

500
00:33:02,608 --> 00:33:04,526
my little bozo friend,

501
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:08,947
things changed big time
over there in Ernieville.

502
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:16,455
That's what you got to do!

503
00:33:16,538 --> 00:33:18,582
- What?
- Shake things up.

504
00:33:18,624 --> 00:33:20,667
Over there, man.
Shake them up.

505
00:33:20,751 --> 00:33:25,464
Make them think of something besides
the temperature in that candy-ass pool.

506
00:33:27,841 --> 00:33:31,303
- Shit, what time is it?
- What kind of question is that?

507
00:33:32,262 --> 00:33:35,224
I got to get back!
They can't build the pool!

508
00:33:36,058 --> 00:33:38,435
Ike, cab...

509
00:33:38,477 --> 00:33:40,604
on the J-Man.

510
00:33:40,646 --> 00:33:44,316
- Come on!

511
00:33:51,114 --> 00:33:52,115
Excuse me!

512
00:33:55,744 --> 00:33:57,162
Sir! Sir!

513
00:33:57,204 --> 00:33:58,789
You have to stop, please.

514
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:00,541
Here they come!

515
00:34:00,624 --> 00:34:02,501
- Whoo!
- Hi, Mom!

516
00:34:02,584 --> 00:34:04,795
Digging, no. We can't pay for the pool.

517
00:34:04,837 --> 00:34:07,339
We don't... we can't pay for the pool.

518
00:34:07,381 --> 00:34:09,800
No, no. Stop! Sir!
No mas!

519
00:34:09,842 --> 00:34:12,803
- Sir, I'll talk to the office.

520
00:34:13,303 --> 00:34:15,138
Good afternoon, Mr. Tim.

521
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:19,560
- Hi.
- You look really, really wonderful.

522
00:34:19,643 --> 00:34:23,313
And here is something from
your great friends across the street

523
00:34:23,355 --> 00:34:26,024
while your wonderful family is away.

524
00:34:34,867 --> 00:34:38,579
"Thought you might enjoy a taste
from our newly acquired vineyard."

525
00:35:02,102 --> 00:35:06,982
You got to shake things up.
Over there, man. Shake them up.

526
00:35:14,198 --> 00:35:16,283
Carousel of dreams.

527
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:20,579
Casa Corky.

528
00:35:21,622 --> 00:35:23,373
Casa Corky.

529
00:35:26,793 --> 00:35:28,587
Incredible.

530
00:35:28,629 --> 00:35:30,339
Incredible hedge work.

531
00:35:37,721 --> 00:35:39,723
You got to shake things up.

532
00:35:39,806 --> 00:35:41,934
Over there, man.
Shake them up.

533
00:35:42,017 --> 00:35:45,562
Shake things up.
Shake them up.

534
00:36:08,293 --> 00:36:09,920
Huh?

535
00:36:27,145 --> 00:36:28,188
Corky.

536
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:32,109
My God. How is this possible?

537
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:34,862
How could a little arrow
kill a big horse?

538
00:36:34,945 --> 00:36:37,239
Come on, Corky.
Corky, come on, come on.

539
00:36:37,322 --> 00:36:40,409
It's just a little arrow.
Come on, Corky.

540
00:36:40,492 --> 00:36:41,910
Giddy up, boy.

541
00:36:41,994 --> 00:36:44,121
Corky. Giddy up. Giddy up.

542
00:36:44,204 --> 00:36:46,164
Corky.

543
00:36:48,208 --> 00:36:50,377
Okay, Corky.

544
00:36:51,378 --> 00:36:53,672
Come on, boy. One, two.

545
00:36:53,714 --> 00:36:55,757
Come on.

546
00:36:55,841 --> 00:36:57,467
Shit.

547
00:36:57,551 --> 00:37:00,053
Shit. God.

548
00:37:02,055 --> 00:37:04,558
Come on, Corky.

549
00:38:02,574 --> 00:38:04,201
Hey.

550
00:38:07,829 --> 00:38:10,082
Cock-a-doodle-doo.

551
00:38:10,165 --> 00:38:13,293
Car return.
How's that for service?

552
00:38:13,377 --> 00:38:17,673
I'd probably still be driving a limo
if it wasn't for the hat.

553
00:38:17,756 --> 00:38:18,757
Hats.

554
00:38:18,841 --> 00:38:21,218
Hats make my head itch.

555
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:24,388
- What time is it?
- You got a time hang-up, don't you?

556
00:38:24,429 --> 00:38:25,931
Oh, God.

557
00:38:26,014 --> 00:38:28,559
- Look at me.
- I was thinking the same thing.

558
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,477
You are one big stinking pig, Tim.

559
00:38:30,561 --> 00:38:32,229
- How'd you get my keys?
- Keys?

560
00:38:32,271 --> 00:38:35,732
The J-Man don't usually need keys,
my little dumbbell pal.

561
00:38:35,774 --> 00:38:39,820
So, that's the place?

562
00:38:39,903 --> 00:38:43,615
Look at it. All from shit?
I see what you mean.

563
00:38:43,699 --> 00:38:47,160
I don't even live here and that place
is pulling my testicles up.

564
00:38:47,244 --> 00:38:50,080
I mean, literally,
they're actually coming up.

565
00:38:50,122 --> 00:38:52,249
You ever get that?

566
00:38:52,291 --> 00:38:53,792
I killed his horse.

567
00:38:53,834 --> 00:38:56,503
- What?
- I killed his horse.

568
00:38:56,587 --> 00:38:59,548
That story you were telling
about shaking things up...

569
00:38:59,631 --> 00:39:02,092
I went over there and
I shot this bow and arrow,

570
00:39:02,134 --> 00:39:05,679
and I shot at my house
and I hit his horse.

571
00:39:05,762 --> 00:39:07,472
He was eating apples in my yard.

572
00:39:07,556 --> 00:39:11,393
There was a hole because we were going
to have a pool and I buried him in it.

573
00:39:11,476 --> 00:39:14,771
- Well, now.
- Daddy! We're home!

574
00:39:14,813 --> 00:39:16,190
No!

575
00:39:20,819 --> 00:39:22,279
It's my family.

576
00:39:22,321 --> 00:39:23,614
- Hide!
- Hide?

577
00:39:23,655 --> 00:39:25,532
Hide! Hide.

578
00:39:25,616 --> 00:39:29,328
- Hide? Can't I just mosey off?
- No! Don't mosey off.

579
00:39:29,411 --> 00:39:31,788
No, you can't mosey off.
They'll see you!

580
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:34,166
- So?
- So? So, what are you doing here?

581
00:39:34,208 --> 00:39:36,293
Who are you?
You're some guy from a bar.

582
00:39:36,376 --> 00:39:40,547
What's wrong with...?
I'm the J-Man, bringing your car back.

583
00:39:40,631 --> 00:39:42,132
Daddy!

584
00:39:42,174 --> 00:39:44,051
- Hey, tiger!
- Daddy!

585
00:39:44,134 --> 00:39:47,429
- Hey, peanut.
- We all really missed you.

586
00:39:47,513 --> 00:39:51,058
You look terrible.
Honey, one question.

587
00:39:51,141 --> 00:39:54,269
What is at the heart of everything?
What I'm asking you is:

588
00:39:54,353 --> 00:39:57,689
What is at the heart of the heart
of the heart of the heart?

589
00:39:57,773 --> 00:40:00,817
Do you know what the answer is?
Self-love.

590
00:40:00,859 --> 00:40:04,071
Windsong told me that I have been
hating myself for resenting you.

591
00:40:04,154 --> 00:40:07,908
And you've been resenting yourself
for passing up on a big opportunity.

592
00:40:07,991 --> 00:40:11,328
What we need to do
is we need to focus on what we have.

593
00:40:12,955 --> 00:40:15,666
Hey! Oh, hey!

594
00:40:15,749 --> 00:40:18,043
This is... This guy...

595
00:40:18,085 --> 00:40:19,837
Honey...

596
00:40:19,878 --> 00:40:23,465
this is...
This man is the man...

597
00:40:24,633 --> 00:40:27,135
who was in the bathroom.
I didn't tell you.

598
00:40:31,306 --> 00:40:35,686
Honey... something happened
while you were gone, something bad.

599
00:40:35,727 --> 00:40:37,229
What?

600
00:40:37,271 --> 00:40:38,897
I'll take it from here, Tim.

601
00:40:40,399 --> 00:40:42,359
Mrs. Dingman...

602
00:40:42,401 --> 00:40:45,112
I'm Elmo Carp, pool rep.

603
00:40:45,195 --> 00:40:49,950
Your husband and I were up here
discussing your swimming pool options.

604
00:40:50,033 --> 00:40:51,910
- Swimming pool options?
- Yes.

605
00:40:51,994 --> 00:40:54,037
You see, we dug it,
we had to fill it back in.

606
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:57,624
We're sorry as heck.
Where do we go from here?

607
00:40:57,708 --> 00:41:00,544
That's the point we were at
when you barged in.

608
00:41:00,586 --> 00:41:03,505
I don't understand.
Fill it back in?

609
00:41:03,589 --> 00:41:06,800
So you mean we're not getting a pool?

610
00:41:06,884 --> 00:41:10,095
No, sonny boy, I'm afraid not.
Too many gosh darn pipes.

611
00:41:10,179 --> 00:41:11,555
- Pipes?
- Yes.

612
00:41:11,597 --> 00:41:13,849
Underground pipes in your yard,

613
00:41:13,932 --> 00:41:19,021
but I've intruded enough
on your little family reunion here.

614
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:20,814
I'll be on my way.

615
00:41:20,898 --> 00:41:23,775
And thanks for filthying up
your clothes,

616
00:41:23,817 --> 00:41:25,777
helping me fill in the big hole, Tim.

617
00:41:25,819 --> 00:41:29,072
Ma'am, your husband's
got the back of a coal miner.

618
00:41:29,114 --> 00:41:32,576
I know because I've mined coal.
See you.

619
00:41:41,084 --> 00:41:43,170
Something's happened to Corky.

620
00:41:43,253 --> 00:41:44,880
- What?
- Corky?

621
00:41:44,963 --> 00:41:47,424
- Have you seen Corky?
- I haven't seen Corky.

622
00:41:47,466 --> 00:41:49,343
- Corky's gone?
- Have you seen Corky?

623
00:41:49,426 --> 00:41:51,428
- I have not seen Corky.
- That's what I mean.

624
00:41:51,512 --> 00:41:54,014
We've been looking and looking.
Where could he be?

625
00:41:54,097 --> 00:41:57,601
- A great big horse, where?
- Nick, a horse can't just disappear.

626
00:41:57,643 --> 00:41:59,853
- He's got to be somewhere.
- Yeah, but where?

627
00:41:59,937 --> 00:42:03,106
Where? Where?
The kids are a mess.

628
00:42:03,148 --> 00:42:05,776
Wish me luck.

629
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:09,321
Corky!

630
00:42:09,404 --> 00:42:11,907
Corky, come on!

631
00:42:13,909 --> 00:42:17,079
Good afternoon.
My name is Natalie Vanderpark.

632
00:42:17,162 --> 00:42:19,498
I'm running for state senate
in your district.

633
00:42:19,581 --> 00:42:21,667
So I thought l'd
canvass the neighborhood

634
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:23,627
and introduce myself to everyone.

635
00:42:23,669 --> 00:42:25,504
Who it is, Mable?

636
00:42:25,546 --> 00:42:28,590
It's that woman running
for state senate, Carl.

637
00:42:29,258 --> 00:42:33,428
The shit lady? No way.
We're going with Shaunessey.

638
00:42:33,512 --> 00:42:35,055
Your opponent Shaunessey,

639
00:42:35,138 --> 00:42:37,724
he asked a good question
on the radio this morning.

640
00:42:37,808 --> 00:42:39,226
And what question was that?

641
00:42:39,309 --> 00:42:43,689
Well, didn't your husband get loaded
making turds disappear?

642
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:47,943
My husband invented Vapoorize,
if that's what you're referring to.

643
00:42:48,026 --> 00:42:50,529
That's what Shaunessey
was talking about.

644
00:42:50,612 --> 00:42:54,491
Where do all them turds go?
I mean, they got to be somewhere.

645
00:42:54,533 --> 00:42:57,035
First they're here,
then they're not here,

646
00:42:57,077 --> 00:42:58,579
and then they disappear.

647
00:42:58,662 --> 00:43:02,541
Where does the turd go to?
Really, tell me now.

648
00:43:26,106 --> 00:43:27,566
So long, everybody.

649
00:43:27,608 --> 00:43:29,860
- Bye, have a good day at work.
- Bye, Daddy.

650
00:43:29,943 --> 00:43:33,530
- Bye, honey.
- Good luck at the salt mines, Dad.

651
00:43:38,243 --> 00:43:39,745
Where am I going?

652
00:43:39,828 --> 00:43:42,039
Wait. Timmy, wait!

653
00:43:42,122 --> 00:43:44,708
Wait! God.

654
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:46,418
Timmy, I can't find him.

655
00:43:46,502 --> 00:43:48,962
I've been looking all night
and he's nowhere.

656
00:43:49,046 --> 00:43:51,298
I know he's just a horse, but...

657
00:43:51,381 --> 00:43:53,217
Corky.

658
00:43:53,258 --> 00:43:56,970
Corky! Where are you,
my Corky boy?

659
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:04,186
God, look at me.
This is crazy.

660
00:44:04,269 --> 00:44:07,064
Will you pass these out
down at 3M for me?

661
00:44:08,649 --> 00:44:13,695
I found some grooming hairs
in his tail brush.

662
00:44:13,779 --> 00:44:15,739
My God.

663
00:44:15,822 --> 00:44:18,283
- $50,000?
- It's pennies!

664
00:44:18,325 --> 00:44:22,412
It's pennies. Who cares?
Corky's my pal.

665
00:44:23,247 --> 00:44:29,211
He's my pal and I'd pay $50,000 to
find you if you were lost, wouldn't l?

666
00:44:29,294 --> 00:44:32,089
- Yeah.
- Wouldn't l?!

667
00:44:37,261 --> 00:44:39,221
- Okay.

668
00:44:39,304 --> 00:44:41,849
All right.
It's going to be okay.

669
00:44:41,849 --> 00:44:42,307
All right.
It's going to be okay.

670
00:45:14,882 --> 00:45:16,633
Are you insane?

671
00:45:16,675 --> 00:45:20,470
That is the most selfish thing
I ever heard in my life.

672
00:45:20,512 --> 00:45:24,641
The guy loves you, man.
You'd be killing your best friend.

673
00:45:24,683 --> 00:45:27,186
You killed his horse, right?
You killed his horse.

674
00:45:27,269 --> 00:45:30,480
Now you want to tell him?
You tell him.

675
00:45:30,522 --> 00:45:33,025
What about this?
We move the horse someplace else.

676
00:45:33,066 --> 00:45:37,321
I find it, I get the reward.
I'm bending over backwards here.

677
00:45:37,404 --> 00:45:39,489
How do we move a horse?

678
00:45:39,531 --> 00:45:41,825
We dig him up. We haul him off.

679
00:45:41,867 --> 00:45:45,913
No, I mean...
without anybody seeing us.

680
00:45:45,996 --> 00:45:47,831
You ever hear of night?

681
00:45:47,873 --> 00:45:50,834
What about the noise?
My family's right there.

682
00:45:50,876 --> 00:45:52,753
I don't want them to...

683
00:45:52,836 --> 00:45:55,005
You don't move the horse, I do,

684
00:45:55,047 --> 00:45:57,341
while you and your family
are enjoying nature,

685
00:45:57,424 --> 00:45:59,510
down at my cabin on the lake.

686
00:45:59,593 --> 00:46:02,679
- You have a cabin on the lake?
- What?

687
00:46:02,763 --> 00:46:04,765
You think I didn't have a childhood?

688
00:46:04,848 --> 00:46:08,268
Bunk beds, hiking trails, hooty owls.

689
00:46:09,686 --> 00:46:11,855
You can move a horse by yourself?

690
00:46:11,939 --> 00:46:15,234
For 50 grand.

691
00:46:19,446 --> 00:46:22,032
But I will say this:

692
00:46:22,908 --> 00:46:26,495
Knowing what I happen to know
about things buried,

693
00:46:26,578 --> 00:46:28,372
the sooner the better.

694
00:46:28,455 --> 00:46:31,124
- Hey, Deb?
- Mmm-hmm?

695
00:46:31,208 --> 00:46:33,460
How'd you like to go
to a nice cabin on a lake?

696
00:46:33,544 --> 00:46:36,255
- Cabin on a lake?
- Yeah.

697
00:46:36,338 --> 00:46:40,259
This guy at work offered his cabin.
It's supposed to be really nice.

698
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:43,762
- Who at work offered you this?
- Jackameyer.

699
00:46:43,804 --> 00:46:47,266
Jack... Jack Jackameyer.

700
00:46:47,349 --> 00:46:51,228
It's an hour from here
and it has all sorts of wildlife...

701
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:53,564
and hooty owls and stuff.

702
00:46:53,605 --> 00:46:55,607
Hiking trails.

703
00:46:56,692 --> 00:46:59,695
Where does the shit go?
We want to know!

704
00:46:59,778 --> 00:47:03,699
Where does the shit go?
We want to know!

705
00:47:03,782 --> 00:47:07,160
Where does the shit go?
We want to know!

706
00:47:35,606 --> 00:47:37,774
Pretty incredible, huh?

707
00:47:37,816 --> 00:47:40,986
Whoa!
Watch out. It's okay.

708
00:47:41,069 --> 00:47:42,446
What a spot.

709
00:47:42,529 --> 00:47:45,199
What do you mean, "what a spot"?
I mean, where...

710
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:51,455
He said it's just down at the end
of the private driveway.

711
00:47:51,538 --> 00:47:54,499
What private driveway?
This isn't a private driveway.

712
00:47:54,541 --> 00:47:57,503
This is pretty private, honey.
I mean, this is great.

713
00:47:57,586 --> 00:47:58,962
T alk about secluded.

714
00:47:59,004 --> 00:48:01,298
We've walked, like, a mile.

715
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:04,510
It's not a mile, honey. It seems longer
because it's so beautiful.

716
00:48:04,593 --> 00:48:06,970
Tim!

717
00:48:07,054 --> 00:48:10,265
- Mommy, where's Daddy?
- I don't know, honey.

718
00:48:10,349 --> 00:48:12,935
- I'm thirsty.
- Okay.

719
00:48:14,019 --> 00:48:17,981
- Tim!
- Whoo! I found it!

720
00:48:18,065 --> 00:48:21,860
It's a little sloping incline
down to the...

721
00:48:25,239 --> 00:48:27,491
This is it?

722
00:48:27,574 --> 00:48:29,660
You bet this is it.

723
00:48:30,536 --> 00:48:33,497
This is...
This is wild, huh, kids?

724
00:48:33,539 --> 00:48:37,209
Kind of like a... Like an old
gingerbread house in the woods.

725
00:48:37,292 --> 00:48:38,669
Where's the lake?

726
00:48:39,753 --> 00:48:42,798
I'll tell you what. Why don't
we check out the bunkhouse, okay?

727
00:48:42,881 --> 00:48:46,635
And then you guys can have a contest to
see who finds the lake first, all right?

728
00:48:46,718 --> 00:48:49,471
Winner gets 50 cents.
50 cents. Come on.

729
00:48:49,555 --> 00:48:51,014
Let's check it out.

730
00:48:56,728 --> 00:48:59,273
Okay. Weird smell.

731
00:48:59,356 --> 00:49:01,400
Let's hold our noses. Come on.

732
00:49:02,526 --> 00:49:04,319
It's okay, Mikey, come on in.

733
00:49:05,946 --> 00:49:07,614
- My God.
- It's okay.

734
00:49:07,698 --> 00:49:09,658
Just a little critter. Just...

735
00:49:09,741 --> 00:49:12,911
Don't touch it. He's dead.

736
00:49:17,624 --> 00:49:22,421
Under no circumstances
is this a lake.

737
00:49:25,716 --> 00:49:27,384
Maybe there's a tide.

738
00:49:27,426 --> 00:49:30,304
No one could ever find this lake.

739
00:49:30,387 --> 00:49:33,265
Congratulations,
you saved yourself 50 cents.

740
00:49:42,441 --> 00:49:44,359
What is that?

741
00:50:06,632 --> 00:50:07,966
Tim?

742
00:50:08,050 --> 00:50:10,052
Yes?

743
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:12,346
Tim?

744
00:50:13,305 --> 00:50:14,806
Yes?

745
00:50:14,848 --> 00:50:16,183
You're Tim?

746
00:50:16,266 --> 00:50:18,352
Yes, I'm Tim.

747
00:50:18,435 --> 00:50:20,646
The J-Man says, "Come quick."

748
00:50:20,729 --> 00:50:22,272
Come quick?

749
00:50:22,356 --> 00:50:24,483
Yeah, come quick.

750
00:50:24,566 --> 00:50:26,276
That's it.

751
00:50:26,318 --> 00:50:30,822
Now, when you see the J-Man,
you tell him we're even.

752
00:50:30,906 --> 00:50:35,202
And Bosco says,
"Up your ass with Mobil gas."

753
00:50:36,453 --> 00:50:37,621
Okay.

754
00:50:37,704 --> 00:50:39,665
What will you tell the J-Man?

755
00:50:39,748 --> 00:50:44,628
I'm going to tell him that Bosco
says we're even

756
00:50:44,670 --> 00:50:46,630
and up your ass with Mobil gas.

757
00:50:46,672 --> 00:50:48,173
Mobil gas.

758
00:50:55,722 --> 00:50:58,183
It's Jack's neighbor,
he needs some help.

759
00:50:58,267 --> 00:51:00,269
Neighbor?

760
00:51:00,352 --> 00:51:02,813
That's right, Bosco,
he's as nice as Jack,

761
00:51:02,896 --> 00:51:05,399
but his car's stuck
so I'm going to help him, okay?

762
00:51:05,482 --> 00:51:07,317
I didn't see any neighbors.

763
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:09,528
What? You think Bosco would lie?

764
00:51:09,611 --> 00:51:13,031
Why would Bosco lie?
I'll go get him right now if you want.

765
00:51:13,115 --> 00:51:15,117
Okay.

766
00:51:16,034 --> 00:51:17,536
- Okay?
- Yes.

767
00:51:17,578 --> 00:51:19,997
Yes, I'd like to ask him
about this hellhole.

768
00:51:20,038 --> 00:51:21,957
I don't want to bring him in.
He's big.

769
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:24,084
- You know, the floorboards.
- How big?

770
00:51:24,168 --> 00:51:25,127
- How big?
- Yes.

771
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:28,422
Big. He's like a bear of a guy
with, like, a little head.

772
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:31,717
I don't know what that means.

773
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:34,178
Look, I'm going to go help this guy

774
00:51:34,219 --> 00:51:37,848
because Windsong would sure
as hell help this guy. Okay?

775
00:51:37,931 --> 00:51:41,226
I'm going to be back.
Just go back to sleep, okay?

776
00:52:11,215 --> 00:52:13,842
- What's wrong?
- It's for you.

777
00:52:14,927 --> 00:52:16,887
Don't hassle me about crumbs, man,

778
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:19,806
because I am on
the edge of the edge.

779
00:52:21,475 --> 00:52:22,559
Hello?

780
00:52:22,601 --> 00:52:24,728
Natalie stormed out
of the bedroom.

781
00:52:24,811 --> 00:52:27,856
We had a terrible fight.
You got to come over here now.

782
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:29,816
I know you got your Army pal
over there.

783
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:32,486
I didn't know you were in the Army.
If I can come over...

784
00:52:32,569 --> 00:52:34,821
No, l' ll come there.

785
00:52:34,905 --> 00:52:37,574
- Okay, good. Thanks.
- No, no, no. I'll come over.

786
00:52:37,616 --> 00:52:40,077
I'll come there.
Here I come.

787
00:52:40,118 --> 00:52:42,329
I got to go across the street
for a second.

788
00:52:42,412 --> 00:52:44,957
That is incorrect. Follow me.

789
00:52:48,418 --> 00:52:50,879
This was no picnic, let me tell you.

790
00:52:50,963 --> 00:52:53,799
I had an '88 Ford flatbed

791
00:52:53,882 --> 00:52:56,385
all lined up
with a brand-new winch,

792
00:52:56,468 --> 00:52:59,596
but I fried it during the hot-wire,
goddamn it.

793
00:52:59,638 --> 00:53:03,559
Good thing Monk passed out,
or I'd never got this baby.

794
00:53:05,310 --> 00:53:06,937
Whoa.

795
00:53:06,979 --> 00:53:10,023
What in the shit is this?
What is it?

796
00:53:10,983 --> 00:53:15,654
It's winches, hoists, pulleys, blocks
and tackles. This kind of thing.

797
00:53:15,737 --> 00:53:19,366
You know how I got the idea? You know
those big things on Easter lsland?

798
00:53:19,449 --> 00:53:21,451
- Easter lsland?
- Huh?

799
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:22,619
Easter lsland?

800
00:53:22,703 --> 00:53:26,957
With this device, I can place that horse
on top of any object.

801
00:53:26,999 --> 00:53:29,668
That truck's too high.
You won't get the horse in there.

802
00:53:29,751 --> 00:53:33,172
You're like a specially trained
super agent. You know that?

803
00:53:33,255 --> 00:53:35,966
Why do you think I called you?
I was so pissed off.

804
00:53:36,008 --> 00:53:40,220
I nearly climbed back into your house
and smashed some plates.

805
00:53:41,430 --> 00:53:44,349
Stand warned, okay, stand warned.

806
00:53:44,433 --> 00:53:47,811
I have to go over there for a minute
or you don't get your money.

807
00:53:47,895 --> 00:53:49,396
- Do you want your money?
- Yes.

808
00:53:49,479 --> 00:53:53,483
Then put that horse on top of my van.
There's rope and tarp in the garage.

809
00:53:53,567 --> 00:53:56,695
- Put the horse on the van?
- Put the horse on the van.

810
00:53:56,778 --> 00:53:58,614
- Rope.
- Yeah, and be quiet.

811
00:53:58,697 --> 00:54:00,115
It's simple, okay?

812
00:54:00,199 --> 00:54:02,367
- All right? I'll be right back.
- Yeah.

813
00:54:04,077 --> 00:54:05,329
Hello, Mr. Tim.

814
00:54:05,412 --> 00:54:08,290
You're looking very sprightly
for the hour.

815
00:54:08,373 --> 00:54:12,044
We go up the stairs, please.
Right this way.

816
00:54:16,173 --> 00:54:18,300
I've never been in this part.

817
00:54:18,383 --> 00:54:21,929
They are practicing for the tournament.

818
00:54:26,808 --> 00:54:28,018
Come on!

819
00:54:28,101 --> 00:54:29,520
Yes!

820
00:54:29,603 --> 00:54:31,688
Who's your nanny?!

821
00:54:39,947 --> 00:54:41,448
Hey.

822
00:54:41,532 --> 00:54:43,242
Come.

823
00:54:45,702 --> 00:54:47,329
Come here.

824
00:54:48,247 --> 00:54:50,499
Right here, come on.

825
00:54:51,708 --> 00:54:55,045
You're incredible, do you know that?
You're an incredible friend.

826
00:54:56,547 --> 00:54:59,967
- What the hell was that?
- They're bowling next door.

827
00:55:00,050 --> 00:55:03,387
Getting ready for your tournament.
They're hitting strikes.

828
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:05,806
- She's been blaming me for Corky.
- Who?

829
00:55:05,889 --> 00:55:10,394
Natalie, she just kept blaming me
for Corky and making me feel guilty.

830
00:55:10,477 --> 00:55:12,563
Then she starts up with the shit thing.

831
00:55:12,646 --> 00:55:14,773
How do I know where the shit goes?!

832
00:55:14,857 --> 00:55:18,360
Then I tell her, "I'm going to Rome
tomorrow," and she freaks out!

833
00:55:18,443 --> 00:55:22,114
She has a complete flip out!
She flips out the room!

834
00:55:22,197 --> 00:55:24,241
- Where'd she go?
- I don't know.

835
00:55:24,283 --> 00:55:27,286
- Some other wing.

836
00:55:27,327 --> 00:55:30,664
But, buddy...
this ltaly thing is huge.

837
00:55:30,747 --> 00:55:33,584
It could seriously...
It could mean literally billions.

838
00:55:33,667 --> 00:55:37,629
You know what I think this is?
I think you just got to get some sleep.

839
00:55:37,713 --> 00:55:41,550
You got to shut everything down.
Get under the covers. Come on.

840
00:55:41,633 --> 00:55:44,303
Get under the covers.
Don't listen to anything.

841
00:55:44,386 --> 00:55:47,723
- Sometimes you think you hear things...
- You're a great friend.

842
00:55:50,475 --> 00:55:54,229
Sleep and it's going to be different
and don't wake up. Okay?

843
00:55:58,233 --> 00:55:59,902
# Valderi

844
00:55:59,985 --> 00:56:01,486
# Valdera

845
00:56:01,570 --> 00:56:03,071
# Valderi

846
00:56:03,155 --> 00:56:06,283
# Valdera ha ha ha...

847
00:56:06,366 --> 00:56:08,327
# Valderi

848
00:56:09,494 --> 00:56:10,954
Et cetera.

849
00:56:10,996 --> 00:56:12,623
What about here? Right here?

850
00:56:12,706 --> 00:56:14,958
You kidding? There's towns around.

851
00:56:15,042 --> 00:56:17,294
You want somebody else
finding my horse?

852
00:56:18,378 --> 00:56:20,214
There'll be towns everywhere.

853
00:56:20,297 --> 00:56:23,133
Hey, six months I drove
a yogurt truck, okay?

854
00:56:23,175 --> 00:56:24,968
This is my territory, Jack.

855
00:56:40,526 --> 00:56:42,653
What do you got up there?

856
00:56:43,612 --> 00:56:45,197
A sofa.

857
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,866
What kind of sofa?

858
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:49,535
Homemade.

859
00:56:57,292 --> 00:57:01,046
- Oh, my God. What is this?
- Troopers.

860
00:57:01,129 --> 00:57:03,674
Oh, no.

861
00:57:08,178 --> 00:57:09,638
The bridge is out.

862
00:57:09,721 --> 00:57:12,766
Follow the detour along the river
to the next bridge, all right?

863
00:57:12,850 --> 00:57:14,017
Thank you very much.

864
00:57:14,101 --> 00:57:16,061
- Have a good night.
- Let's go.

865
00:57:16,144 --> 00:57:18,647
He didn't notice the horse.

866
00:57:18,730 --> 00:57:23,235
Smokey didn't even notice
that we got a horse on the roof.

867
00:57:29,575 --> 00:57:33,203
- I can't believe he didn't see it.
- Dumb Smokey.

868
00:57:45,090 --> 00:57:48,135
- How about right here?
- No, it's not good.

869
00:57:48,218 --> 00:57:50,637
- What's wrong with here?
- It doesn't feel right.

870
00:57:50,721 --> 00:57:52,681
I hope it's very soon.

871
00:57:52,764 --> 00:57:56,226
I got to be back there.
It's going to be light out.

872
00:57:56,310 --> 00:58:00,063
They're asleep and don't know you left.
I'm doing you a favor doing this.

873
00:58:00,105 --> 00:58:02,191
How about here?
What's wrong with here?

874
00:58:02,274 --> 00:58:04,985
I dig up the horse, I haul it up,
I invent everything.

875
00:58:05,068 --> 00:58:07,529
Why do we have to do
what you want to do?

876
00:58:07,613 --> 00:58:10,115
- Corky's new home.
- This is not good for me.

877
00:58:10,157 --> 00:58:12,075
Forget it. This is it, right here.
Okay?

878
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:13,285
Bad vibe.

879
00:58:16,955 --> 00:58:19,416
Oh, no! He's gone!

880
00:58:21,752 --> 00:58:23,253
Where'd he go?!

881
00:58:23,337 --> 00:58:26,298
Did you hear anything?
Like a thump?

882
00:58:27,382 --> 00:58:29,593
Where did he go?

883
00:58:29,635 --> 00:58:31,762
Shit!

884
00:58:31,803 --> 00:58:35,265
- Did you check the knots?
- Knots? Who knows knots?

885
00:58:35,307 --> 00:58:38,268
- Not you.
- You know, I'm not Popeye.

886
00:58:38,310 --> 00:58:41,605
How did we not hear? How do you
not hear a horse fall off a car?

887
00:58:41,688 --> 00:58:44,191
Maybe he's not dead.
Maybe he ran away.

888
00:58:44,274 --> 00:58:48,362
It's raining so hard,
the horse might have fallen off

889
00:58:48,445 --> 00:58:51,323
and floated, who knows, into a ditch.

890
00:58:52,324 --> 00:58:55,786
There's a river that runs
along this road. He could be in it.

891
00:58:55,869 --> 00:58:58,455
Corky could be heading
for the open sea.

892
00:59:16,932 --> 00:59:20,602
My God, honey.
What time is it?

893
00:59:20,686 --> 00:59:22,813
It's okay.
Go back to sleep.

894
00:59:22,855 --> 00:59:24,565
Yeah?

895
00:59:24,648 --> 00:59:26,567
Did you solve the problem?

896
00:59:27,693 --> 00:59:29,695
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

897
00:59:29,736 --> 00:59:31,446
Actually...

898
00:59:33,574 --> 00:59:35,450
I think I did.

899
00:59:36,451 --> 00:59:41,456
# Gonna be a bright
Bright sunshiny day

900
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:43,584
Whoo!

901
00:59:43,667 --> 00:59:48,213
# Gonna be a bright
Bright sunshiny day

902
00:59:49,798 --> 00:59:53,051
- 
- Timmy! Telephone!

903
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:03,228
Good morning, Mr. Tim.

904
01:00:03,312 --> 01:00:04,563
I must say...

905
01:00:04,646 --> 01:00:07,858
you're looking fit as a fiddle
this morning, Mr. Tim.

906
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:10,360
Thanks.
I hear Mr. Nick wants to see me.

907
01:00:10,402 --> 01:00:11,945
Yes, I know.

908
01:00:12,029 --> 01:00:15,115
He's running in the woods.

909
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:18,327
I talked to the guys over at 3M.
I know you got canned.

910
01:00:18,410 --> 01:00:21,038
You've met Pete, right?
My trainer.

911
01:00:21,121 --> 01:00:24,082
Don't feel funny around Pete.
I got no secrets from Pete.

912
01:00:24,124 --> 01:00:26,043
- Do l, Pete?
- I don't think so.

913
01:00:26,084 --> 01:00:28,587
So here's the deal:
Buddy boy...

914
01:00:28,629 --> 01:00:32,382
that my little hearty
hi-ho Silver routine

915
01:00:32,424 --> 01:00:36,386
affected you like that,
all I can say is, I am such a jerk.

916
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:38,597
But it's the best thing
that ever happened,

917
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:41,642
because now I'll go kick ass in Rome.
And guess what?

918
01:00:41,725 --> 01:00:45,395
You, you unemployed bum,
you'll come kick ass with me.

919
01:00:45,479 --> 01:00:47,272
I want us to be partners.

920
01:00:47,356 --> 01:00:49,816
I want us to be equal again, man.

921
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:52,986
Why not? I mean, for crying out loud,
I've got a Pete.

922
01:00:53,070 --> 01:00:56,907
Why shouldn't you have a Pete?
Who wouldn't like having a Pete?

923
01:00:56,949 --> 01:01:00,160
So this is the deal.
From now on, you and me, 50/50.

924
01:01:00,244 --> 01:01:03,997
- 50/50?
- That's right. 50/50.

925
01:01:04,081 --> 01:01:07,751
I'll talk to my lawyer. Why didn't
I think of it sooner? It's awesome!

926
01:01:07,835 --> 01:01:11,588
Get the hell out of here,
the limo leaves in an hour and a half!

927
01:01:11,672 --> 01:01:14,466
Buddy boy! Let's go, buddy boy!

928
01:01:15,467 --> 01:01:19,221
All right. Come on. Now, pump it up.
I want full cardio blast now.

929
01:01:19,304 --> 01:01:21,473
- Let's go.
- Don't be shy.

930
01:01:22,391 --> 01:01:24,268
There you go.

931
01:01:25,018 --> 01:01:27,521
No, keep going! Keep it there!

932
01:01:30,315 --> 01:01:31,567
Crampers.

933
01:01:31,650 --> 01:01:33,652
- You all right?
- Crampers.

934
01:01:33,735 --> 01:01:35,904
I don't know, honey.
Do you want to do this?

935
01:01:35,988 --> 01:01:38,365
I mean, do we want to be part
of the shit industry?

936
01:01:38,448 --> 01:01:41,285
What about the heart of the heart
of the heart of the heart?

937
01:01:41,326 --> 01:01:45,247
I don't think this conflicts with that.
I mean, you know, there's...

938
01:01:45,330 --> 01:01:49,877
It's a lot of money and the heart
of the heart, and they're both...

939
01:01:51,545 --> 01:01:54,131
Still have the heart
with a lot of money.

940
01:01:54,214 --> 01:01:57,134
- I think. You know.
- You know what I think?

941
01:01:57,176 --> 01:02:01,013
I think I know what we should do.
We should just try it.

942
01:02:01,096 --> 01:02:02,723
- Try it!
- Yes.

943
01:02:02,806 --> 01:02:03,765
- Try it.
- Try it.

944
01:02:03,849 --> 01:02:05,475
Try it.

945
01:02:05,517 --> 01:02:08,061
- Try it. See how it feels.
- Try it.

946
01:02:10,063 --> 01:02:12,524
Oh, my God, I can't believe it!

947
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:18,322
- Bye, Daddy.
- We'll miss you.

948
01:02:18,405 --> 01:02:20,407
- We miss you already.
- I'll be home soon.

949
01:02:33,879 --> 01:02:36,048
Good to see you, captain.

950
01:02:44,723 --> 01:02:47,392
You know what I was thinking?
We should target zoos.

951
01:02:47,476 --> 01:02:48,810
Thank you, Denise. Zoos?

952
01:02:48,852 --> 01:02:51,772
Yeah, zoos. I mean, come on,
they're full of poop.

953
01:02:51,855 --> 01:02:54,858
I popped on the lnternet
just before we got on the plane.

954
01:02:54,942 --> 01:02:58,612
Did you know that an elephant goes,
like 1 00 pounds a day?

955
01:02:58,695 --> 01:03:02,783
Times that by seven, that's 700 pounds
of dung a week for one elephant.

956
01:03:02,866 --> 01:03:05,744
There's got to be thousands of zoos
in the world.

957
01:03:05,827 --> 01:03:09,831
That is really very good. Zoos.

958
01:03:09,915 --> 01:03:11,917
- I got another one for you.
- Yeah?

959
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,878
Travel industry.
We get into the travel industry.

960
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:18,090
I'm talking about little
travel-size Vapoorize.

961
01:03:18,173 --> 01:03:21,426
You mean,
like the cute little shampoo bottles?

962
01:03:21,510 --> 01:03:24,638
- Exactly.
- My God, that's so simple and awesome!

963
01:03:24,721 --> 01:03:27,057
You're on a trip.
You're walking through Venice.

964
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:29,810
You step in some dog doo.
So, what do you do?

965
01:03:29,893 --> 01:03:32,604
- You take out a travel-size Vapoorize.
- That's it!

966
01:03:32,688 --> 01:03:35,274
A little Velcro holster
you put on your belt.

967
01:03:35,357 --> 01:03:38,443
Right next to your cell phone,
your pager, your Vapoorize.

968
01:03:38,527 --> 01:03:41,738
You can walk the dog handsfree
and not worry about the Vapoorize.

969
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:42,865
I love a holster.

970
01:03:42,948 --> 01:03:45,242
- Accessorize with Vapoorize.
- Hold on.

971
01:03:45,325 --> 01:03:47,619
Hold on. Let me take it from here.

972
01:03:47,703 --> 01:03:49,997
# You're walkin' along

973
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:51,456
# A-doodley doo

974
01:03:51,540 --> 01:03:54,751
# All of a sudden
You stepped in poo!

975
01:03:54,835 --> 01:03:57,087
# You don't know what to do

976
01:03:57,129 --> 01:04:00,090
- What do you do?
- I don't know what to do.

977
01:04:01,675 --> 01:04:04,636
# Vapoorize, Vapoorize

978
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:08,557
- # Mountain-scented Vapoorize
- # doogah-doogah-doogah Vapoorize

979
01:04:08,599 --> 01:04:10,642
- What is the doogah?
- I thought there would be drums.

980
01:04:10,642 --> 01:04:12,352
- What is the doogah?
- I thought there would be drums.

981
01:04:31,371 --> 01:04:33,957
Come on. Look at this place.

982
01:04:34,041 --> 01:04:35,959
Go check out your bedroom.

983
01:04:40,506 --> 01:04:42,174
Whoo!

984
01:04:48,263 --> 01:04:49,431
Wow.

985
01:05:11,453 --> 01:05:13,038
Vapoorize.

986
01:05:36,728 --> 01:05:38,188
Shopping.

987
01:05:38,272 --> 01:05:40,482
Gucci.

988
01:05:41,233 --> 01:05:42,776
Here.

989
01:05:43,485 --> 01:05:46,238
This'll look great in the yard
next to the bug tent.

990
01:05:46,321 --> 01:05:50,450
Definitely. We'll take it.
It's great. Pay the man.

991
01:05:50,534 --> 01:05:54,204
It makes the whole house.
It makes the yard. With the sound.

992
01:05:54,288 --> 01:05:57,416
With the sound. It's ridiculous,
but that's what I love about it.

993
01:05:57,499 --> 01:05:58,542
I like this.

994
01:05:58,625 --> 01:06:01,795
...with the Dow off 1 1 and
the NASDAQ up five and a half.

995
01:06:01,879 --> 01:06:04,548
A rather sluggish day on Wall Street.

996
01:06:04,631 --> 01:06:08,302
On the international front, investors
are watching Vanderpark Enterprises.

997
01:06:08,385 --> 01:06:12,055
CEO, Nicholas Vanderpark and newly
appointed partner, Tim Dingman...

998
01:06:12,139 --> 01:06:14,975
arrive in Italy to introduce to Europe

999
01:06:15,058 --> 01:06:20,397
their complete line of fecal-removing
product that's been so successful here.

1000
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:23,150
The American entrepreneurs
have reason to be hopeful.

1001
01:06:23,233 --> 01:06:26,820
They were greeted with great enthusiasm
everywhere and fanfare.

1002
01:06:26,904 --> 01:06:30,991
Later, they'll be feted at a banquet
to be held in the presidential palace.

1003
01:06:39,499 --> 01:06:42,878
He says, "l noticed
when we climbed into the tub

1004
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:46,882
"our three penises were quite similar
in size and bulk."

1005
01:06:51,011 --> 01:06:54,264
He say, "And I thought to myself,

1006
01:06:54,306 --> 01:06:56,642
"'Good. Good."'

1007
01:06:58,101 --> 01:07:00,312
Envy is a funny, funny thing.

1008
01:07:04,650 --> 01:07:08,362
He says, "l remember when
I was a teenager,

1009
01:07:08,445 --> 01:07:11,782
"my friend Armando and I spent
the summer in New York.

1010
01:07:11,823 --> 01:07:13,784
"A sweet time of life."

1011
01:07:23,085 --> 01:07:24,962
The minister, he says,

1012
01:07:25,045 --> 01:07:29,341
"l must tell you, my friend Armando
had a hog like a freight train."

1013
01:07:29,424 --> 01:07:31,927
What a hog.

1014
01:07:38,976 --> 01:07:41,478
He says,
"And I must tell you secretly,

1015
01:07:41,562 --> 01:07:44,439
"Armando's freight-train-sized manhood

1016
01:07:44,481 --> 01:07:48,443
"made me, with a regular-size one,
quite miserable."

1017
01:07:51,530 --> 01:07:54,658
"Not all the time miserable,
of course, but sometimes."

1018
01:08:05,002 --> 01:08:08,380
This call has been
transferred to you.

1019
01:08:08,463 --> 01:08:10,591
Thank you.

1020
01:08:12,259 --> 01:08:13,302
Hello?

1021
01:08:13,385 --> 01:08:15,512
Turbo Everyman, my ass.

1022
01:08:15,596 --> 01:08:19,224
Where do you get off at?
I bought you drinks.

1023
01:08:19,308 --> 01:08:22,519
You vacation in my bungalow
and now you go jump ship.

1024
01:08:22,561 --> 01:08:24,897
Screw Robin Hood, you hear me?

1025
01:08:24,980 --> 01:08:28,192
Screw the Merry Men.
You're a stinko pinko.

1026
01:08:28,275 --> 01:08:30,027
Turncoat!

1027
01:08:30,110 --> 01:08:32,196
Here's what I do, Mr. Traitor.

1028
01:08:32,279 --> 01:08:36,200
Remember Lester? He pumped our gas
when we moved the sofa.

1029
01:08:36,283 --> 01:08:38,702
Not a tooth in his head, nice fella.

1030
01:08:38,744 --> 01:08:42,748
- Remember him now?
- I do. Yes.

1031
01:08:42,831 --> 01:08:48,212
Good. For $50,000
Lester keeps thinking it's a sofa.

1032
01:08:48,253 --> 01:08:50,631
And me and him don't spill the beans

1033
01:08:50,714 --> 01:08:53,550
to your hoity-toity pal
across the street.

1034
01:08:53,592 --> 01:08:57,888
Let's be very clear on this:
I want $50,000...

1035
01:08:57,971 --> 01:09:01,141
or I tell your friend
you killed his horse.

1036
01:09:20,827 --> 01:09:22,788
Debbie? Deb, I'm home.

1037
01:09:22,871 --> 01:09:26,583
Sweetheart, I've been liposucked.

1038
01:09:26,625 --> 01:09:30,087
Can you tell? Can you?
Does it look good?

1039
01:09:30,170 --> 01:09:34,591
Dr. Weitzman is supposed to be a genius
and it didn't even really hurt.

1040
01:09:34,633 --> 01:09:38,595
And that is not all.
Come. I am so excited.

1041
01:09:39,596 --> 01:09:41,849
Here's a little gift I bought for us.

1042
01:09:41,932 --> 01:09:44,768
A little 50/50 surprise.

1043
01:09:46,436 --> 01:09:48,647
- My big international partner.
- Debbie.

1044
01:09:48,730 --> 01:09:51,149
- Let's do it on the laundry.
- Where are the kids?!

1045
01:09:51,233 --> 01:09:53,402
At Mother's, honey. It's just us.

1046
01:09:53,485 --> 01:09:57,990
Come lie on the warm pile.
It's all clean out of the dryer.

1047
01:09:58,073 --> 01:10:01,034
I will lie with you
after I tell you something important.

1048
01:10:01,118 --> 01:10:05,956
I got drunk and by mistake killed Corky.
I buried him in the swimming pool hole.

1049
01:10:05,998 --> 01:10:09,084
The pool guy,
he's actually some bum I met at a bar.

1050
01:10:09,168 --> 01:10:10,794
Nick? Where does it go?

1051
01:10:10,878 --> 01:10:12,754
- What?
- The shit.

1052
01:10:12,796 --> 01:10:14,464
- Where does the shit go?
- Up.

1053
01:10:14,548 --> 01:10:17,217
Up is not good enough.
You'll have to do better than up.

1054
01:10:17,301 --> 01:10:20,387
- Up... and out.
- Out where?!

1055
01:10:20,470 --> 01:10:22,306
Up and out. Out. Up and out.

1056
01:10:22,347 --> 01:10:24,474
- Up and out?
- Up and out.

1057
01:10:24,558 --> 01:10:26,852
The bum wants $50,000
or he'll tell Nick.

1058
01:10:26,935 --> 01:10:29,897
- Then we won't get a chance to be rich.

1059
01:10:29,980 --> 01:10:32,232
Oh, my God.

1060
01:10:32,316 --> 01:10:33,817
Yes!

1061
01:10:33,901 --> 01:10:35,485
Go and pay the bum.

1062
01:10:35,569 --> 01:10:37,696
- Go pay the bum now.
- Go pay the bum?!

1063
01:10:38,530 --> 01:10:40,824
- Honey, I love you.
- I love you too.

1064
01:10:40,908 --> 01:10:42,534
- Bye.
- Oh!

1065
01:10:42,618 --> 01:10:43,702
What?

1066
01:10:43,785 --> 01:10:46,788
You don't know this guy.
He's not like other people, he's...

1067
01:10:46,830 --> 01:10:49,082
What if we pay him
and then he wants more?

1068
01:10:49,166 --> 01:10:52,002
Then we will give him more.

1069
01:10:52,085 --> 01:10:53,587
What if he wants more again?!

1070
01:10:53,670 --> 01:10:57,049
We'll give him more money because
we'll have enough money to give him.

1071
01:10:57,132 --> 01:11:00,260
But it'll never end with him.
He'll be in our lives forever.

1072
01:11:00,344 --> 01:11:03,597
Tim, if he tells Nick,
it'll all be over.

1073
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:05,724
You know, what else can we do?

1074
01:11:07,768 --> 01:11:09,770
We fess up.

1075
01:11:11,104 --> 01:11:13,774
- Fess up?
- Yeah.

1076
01:11:13,857 --> 01:11:16,902
Yeah. No, no, no. We fess up.
We fess up. We tell Nick.

1077
01:11:16,985 --> 01:11:19,112
We go and ask for forgiveness.

1078
01:11:19,196 --> 01:11:20,656
- Forgiveness?
- Yes.

1079
01:11:20,697 --> 01:11:24,159
- Honey, you killed his horse!
- I'm telling him everything.

1080
01:11:24,243 --> 01:11:27,746
No, sweetheart! Please.
Please don't do it to me.

1081
01:11:27,829 --> 01:11:31,875
I love my car in the garage.
It's got heated seats.

1082
01:11:31,959 --> 01:11:34,628
And I've got shoes. I've got bags.

1083
01:11:34,711 --> 01:11:36,839
- Knock, knock.
- Clothes.

1084
01:11:36,922 --> 01:11:39,508
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

1085
01:11:39,591 --> 01:11:41,260
Look at you two.

1086
01:11:41,343 --> 01:11:45,556
God, I'm so envious of you!
You've got to give Natalie a talk.

1087
01:11:45,597 --> 01:11:48,851
She's locked herself in the bathroom
and I want what you have so bad!

1088
01:11:48,892 --> 01:11:51,520
- I want some of that!
- Okay.

1089
01:11:51,603 --> 01:11:56,316
Shh! Don't say a word.
Not a word. Not a word. Okay?

1090
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:59,528
Everywhere I go,
they yell, "Where does the shit go?"

1091
01:11:59,570 --> 01:12:01,864
And we don't know!
What if my opponent's right?

1092
01:12:01,905 --> 01:12:04,241
- What if we are polluting?
- Natalie...

1093
01:12:04,324 --> 01:12:09,079
the only thing this guy Shaunessey's
got going for him is your own guilt.

1094
01:12:09,162 --> 01:12:10,664
Guilt that you're wealthy.

1095
01:12:10,747 --> 01:12:15,586
You know what, we're partners now
and we have money too.

1096
01:12:15,627 --> 01:12:17,713
You know what we'll do with ours?

1097
01:12:17,754 --> 01:12:22,885
We're going to sponsor the biggest rally
for you that this town has ever seen.

1098
01:12:22,968 --> 01:12:25,679
Then we'll throw out
this challenge:

1099
01:12:25,762 --> 01:12:31,894
We'll say that if anyone can say
that Vapoorize does damage to anything,

1100
01:12:31,935 --> 01:12:35,022
then Natalie Vanderpark will cease
to be a candidate.

1101
01:12:41,111 --> 01:12:44,990
May I suggest
we put on our dancing shoes?

1102
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:50,495
Honey! I love you.

1103
01:12:50,579 --> 01:12:53,081
So how was the flight?
Was it enjoyable?

1104
01:12:53,165 --> 01:12:56,084
Yeah, it was fine. It was very smooth.
Everything went fine.

1105
01:12:56,126 --> 01:12:58,962
Here's what I got to tell you.
We'll pay you the money, okay?

1106
01:12:59,046 --> 01:13:00,714
We got it all worked out.

1107
01:13:00,797 --> 01:13:03,592
That is sensational news,
my little gypsy roving friend.

1108
01:13:03,634 --> 01:13:07,679
But I've revised my thinking
about the $50,000 grand thing.

1109
01:13:07,763 --> 01:13:12,267
I can't accept that.
I mean, what are we, animals?

1110
01:13:12,351 --> 01:13:14,728
- What? No, we're not animals.
- No, of course not.

1111
01:13:14,811 --> 01:13:18,315
What we are is pals.
You slept in my bunk.

1112
01:13:18,398 --> 01:13:21,401
I ate some of your crackers.
We sang in the rain.

1113
01:13:21,485 --> 01:13:22,778
# Valderi

1114
01:13:22,819 --> 01:13:24,279
# Valdera

1115
01:13:25,697 --> 01:13:27,449
# Valderi

1116
01:13:28,116 --> 01:13:29,743
# Valdera ha ha ha...

1117
01:13:29,826 --> 01:13:31,411
Okay.

1118
01:13:33,163 --> 01:13:35,624
# My knapsack on my back

1119
01:13:35,666 --> 01:13:38,085
- Yes, I remember.
- That's when we were buddies.

1120
01:13:38,168 --> 01:13:40,295
Last week? Yeah. I remember.

1121
01:13:40,379 --> 01:13:44,967
So, what I'm saying is to hell
with the flat cash payout.

1122
01:13:45,050 --> 01:13:46,885
I say let's be partners.

1123
01:13:46,969 --> 01:13:48,846
- Partners?
- Why not?

1124
01:13:48,887 --> 01:13:51,056
- What do you mean "partners"?
- You, me...

1125
01:13:51,139 --> 01:13:54,059
your other so-called friend
in a cozy little triumvirate.

1126
01:13:54,142 --> 01:13:55,561
Am I using the word correctly?

1127
01:13:55,644 --> 01:13:59,189
Listen to me. We're not partners, okay?
How can we be partners?

1128
01:13:59,273 --> 01:14:01,733
We'll iron out the details
when I come over later.

1129
01:14:01,817 --> 01:14:04,361
- No.
- This evening. Who knows exactly when.

1130
01:14:04,444 --> 01:14:06,113
- You're not coming over here.
- Yes.

1131
01:14:06,196 --> 01:14:09,741
And don't you worry, buddy partner.
I'll smooth out the rough parts.

1132
01:14:09,825 --> 01:14:13,328
- You want to talk? Where are you?
- I'm coming over.

1133
01:14:13,370 --> 01:14:16,039
- You're not coming over.
- Don't you worry, buddy roll.

1134
01:14:16,123 --> 01:14:17,958
We'll put pen to paper. Bye-bye.

1135
01:14:18,041 --> 01:14:19,418
- Listen to me.
- Bye-bye.

1136
01:14:19,501 --> 01:14:22,379
There are no rough parts to smooth...
What? Hello?

1137
01:14:26,466 --> 01:14:27,926
Oh, God.

1138
01:14:28,010 --> 01:14:31,722
All right. I got to tell Nick.
I'm just going to tell him.

1139
01:14:48,947 --> 01:14:52,701
Come on, honey.
Start with your hips.

1140
01:14:53,493 --> 01:14:55,078
Come on.

1141
01:14:55,162 --> 01:14:56,705
Whoo!

1142
01:15:14,556 --> 01:15:14,640
Mr. Vanderpark!
Mr. Vanderpark!

1143
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:18,435
Mr. Vanderpark!
Mr. Vanderpark!

1144
01:15:18,477 --> 01:15:21,355
- The merry-go-round is acting up again.

1145
01:15:23,565 --> 01:15:26,527
I hate that thing. I hate it.

1146
01:15:26,610 --> 01:15:29,446
Timmy, I'm sorry,
we got to deal with it.

1147
01:15:33,951 --> 01:15:36,954
Nick, I gotta talk to you.
I did something really stupid.

1148
01:15:37,037 --> 01:15:40,499
You won't believe what happened.
The stupidest, most ridiculous thing.

1149
01:15:40,582 --> 01:15:42,251
That wife of yours was incredible.

1150
01:15:42,334 --> 01:15:45,963
But I don't care how much money
we make, don't buy one of these.

1151
01:15:46,046 --> 01:15:49,216
It's junk.
It just keeps speeding up for no reason.

1152
01:15:49,299 --> 01:15:53,887
- Nick, I got to talk to you.
- And the on/off button's in the middle!

1153
01:15:53,971 --> 01:15:57,057
- I did a horrible thing.
- The thing's in the middle.

1154
01:15:57,140 --> 01:16:00,143
- Here goes. All right, come on.
- Nick!

1155
01:16:06,650 --> 01:16:09,027
- Nick!

1156
01:16:25,669 --> 01:16:29,131
- Hang on!
- I can't hold on much longer!

1157
01:16:37,264 --> 01:16:39,266
- Nick, are you okay?
- Ribs.

1158
01:16:39,349 --> 01:16:41,393
Yeah. No, I'm fine.

1159
01:16:41,476 --> 01:16:42,853
Goddamned...

1160
01:16:42,895 --> 01:16:46,690
Bastard, bitch merry-go-round.
Stupid merry-go-round!

1161
01:16:46,773 --> 01:16:50,194
- I got to talk to you.
- Stupid, crappy, stupid thing.

1162
01:16:50,277 --> 01:16:52,946
I've been feeling guilty
for a long time.

1163
01:16:53,030 --> 01:16:56,533
- It's impossible to turn it off.
- I did something really stupid.

1164
01:16:56,617 --> 01:16:59,119
- I hate you, merry-go-round.
- Where's the switch?

1165
01:16:59,203 --> 01:17:03,040
It's in the middle of the thing.
It's impossible to turn off.

1166
01:17:03,123 --> 01:17:04,917
- Where's the button?
- In the middle.

1167
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,419
I'll turn it off, then we'll talk.

1168
01:17:07,503 --> 01:17:08,629
I'll get it.

1169
01:17:15,427 --> 01:17:17,513
- Whoa!
- Ow!

1170
01:17:17,596 --> 01:17:20,891
Oh! Oh! Timmy.

1171
01:17:20,933 --> 01:17:24,811
Man, are you all right?
Let me help you up there.

1172
01:17:24,895 --> 01:17:29,233
Come on, buddy. Come on, buddy.
Come on, buddy. All right.

1173
01:17:29,274 --> 01:17:30,817
- You okay? Yeah?
- Yeah.

1174
01:17:30,901 --> 01:17:35,531
It knocked the wind out of you.
You went flying off of that thing.

1175
01:17:35,614 --> 01:17:40,619
Now, listen. I don't want to let this
ruin our jolly feeling.

1176
01:17:40,702 --> 01:17:44,081
Let's go back in there
and talk about this fantastic rally.

1177
01:17:44,164 --> 01:17:47,334
- No, Nick. You see this bow and arrow?
- Yeah.

1178
01:17:47,417 --> 01:17:49,878
- One night...
- Yeah?

1179
01:17:50,921 --> 01:17:52,798
One night...

1180
01:17:52,881 --> 01:17:55,425
I'm so ashamed of this.
But one night...

1181
01:17:58,762 --> 01:18:01,890
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, man!

1182
01:18:01,932 --> 01:18:04,810
- I told you it was a piece of junk!
- I'm glad we weren't on it.

1183
01:18:04,893 --> 01:18:06,770
- What?
- I'm glad we weren't on it.

1184
01:18:06,854 --> 01:18:10,816
- I can't hear. Are your ears ringing?
- No.

1185
01:18:10,899 --> 01:18:14,570
Boy, mine are. What was it
you were saying, my fine friend?

1186
01:18:14,611 --> 01:18:17,739
What I was saying is that one night
I got drunk. All right?

1187
01:18:17,781 --> 01:18:20,784
Being drunk had nothing to do with it.
I can't even explain it.

1188
01:18:20,868 --> 01:18:24,663
Wait, you know what?
I'm thinking it's just one ear.

1189
01:18:24,746 --> 01:18:28,500
I hear you way better
when I turn like this. Talk to me.

1190
01:18:28,584 --> 01:18:31,879
That night I got drunk and
I was aiming this arrow at my house.

1191
01:18:31,962 --> 01:18:34,131
No, it's both ears.
What are you doing?

1192
01:18:34,214 --> 01:18:35,799
I'm trying to tell you.

1193
01:18:35,883 --> 01:18:38,427
I pulled it back, I aimed at the house,
I did this.

1194
01:18:38,468 --> 01:18:41,763
Nick, Nathan and Nellie
want you to kiss their boo-boos.

1195
01:18:41,805 --> 01:18:44,808
Wait, I heard that. I'm coming!

1196
01:18:44,892 --> 01:18:46,685
That was not a smart thing to do.

1197
01:18:46,768 --> 01:18:47,936
- I know!
- Come on.

1198
01:18:47,978 --> 01:18:50,814
No, Nick!
I got to tell...

1199
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:06,455
Oh, shit!

1200
01:19:09,082 --> 01:19:11,418
- Timmy, honey!
- What?!

1201
01:19:11,502 --> 01:19:12,628
Where are you?

1202
01:19:12,711 --> 01:19:16,882
Timmy. Honey, I got it.
Definitely in the hips.

1203
01:19:16,965 --> 01:19:18,884
Timmy, where have you been?

1204
01:19:18,967 --> 01:19:20,677
- I killed the bum.
- What?

1205
01:19:20,761 --> 01:19:21,970
The bum. I shot an arrow.

1206
01:19:22,054 --> 01:19:25,140
It went up, it went down.
It's in the bum. I killed him.

1207
01:19:25,182 --> 01:19:26,725
Come. Come.

1208
01:19:26,808 --> 01:19:29,311
- Did you work out a deal with him?
- No! He's dead.

1209
01:19:29,353 --> 01:19:32,314
It's in his back. The arrow.
I shot him. I killed him.

1210
01:19:32,356 --> 01:19:34,483
I killed a person!

1211
01:19:36,318 --> 01:19:39,988
What? Is this a joke?
I don't get your jokes sometimes.

1212
01:19:40,030 --> 01:19:43,116
And I'll tell you something:
I don't think it's always me.

1213
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:44,576
- Hurry up! Come on!
- Honey!

1214
01:19:44,660 --> 01:19:48,038
- Hurry. Get in the house.
- Let it go. Stop! What are you doing?

1215
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:49,873
Wait! He could be in the house.

1216
01:19:49,915 --> 01:19:53,710
- There's nobody there! God.
- Car! He's wounded! He's crazy!

1217
01:19:53,794 --> 01:19:57,464
- Honey, this is really insane.
- Get in! Get in!

1218
01:20:14,356 --> 01:20:15,983
Excuse me.

1219
01:20:16,066 --> 01:20:19,194
This'll take half a second.
Could you tell me...

1220
01:20:19,278 --> 01:20:21,572
what's sticking in my back, please?

1221
01:20:23,407 --> 01:20:25,450
- Arrow.
- Fricking nitwit.

1222
01:20:25,534 --> 01:20:30,539
Look, I'm being stalked
by a genuine madman, okay?

1223
01:20:30,581 --> 01:20:32,833
I'm talking about a black force here.

1224
01:20:32,916 --> 01:20:35,544
I hate spoiling the atmosphere,

1225
01:20:35,627 --> 01:20:39,965
but would you mind
tugging the arrow out?

1226
01:20:40,549 --> 01:20:44,970
I want you to stop the car.
Honey, stop the car right now!

1227
01:20:45,053 --> 01:20:48,807
- Look. The guy's crazy.
- There is no dead man!

1228
01:20:48,891 --> 01:20:50,684
He's a loose cannon.

1229
01:20:50,767 --> 01:20:53,562
- Excuse me.

1230
01:20:56,565 --> 01:20:59,359
Oh, my God, there is a bum
with an arrow.

1231
01:20:59,443 --> 01:21:01,486
He looks afraid of us.

1232
01:21:07,242 --> 01:21:10,287
You ever hear of "reach for the sky"?

1233
01:21:10,370 --> 01:21:13,415
You just shoot a guy in the back
with no warning.

1234
01:21:13,498 --> 01:21:15,125
That's right.

1235
01:21:15,209 --> 01:21:17,628
That's correct.
That's right. That's what I do.

1236
01:21:17,669 --> 01:21:19,713
Well, then, good God almighty,

1237
01:21:19,796 --> 01:21:23,133
we have entered, indeed,
into a dark day.

1238
01:21:24,176 --> 01:21:27,262
You got to talk to him.
We were pals.

1239
01:21:27,346 --> 01:21:29,932
Who shoots a pal in the back
with a bow and arrow?

1240
01:21:30,015 --> 01:21:32,768
- Over a couple of bucks.
- Me.

1241
01:21:32,809 --> 01:21:36,063
I'm an archer and I shoot arrows.

1242
01:21:36,146 --> 01:21:39,608
And I got more back
where they came from. My quiver.

1243
01:21:39,650 --> 01:21:42,027
Listen to me.
I just wanted what you wanted.

1244
01:21:42,110 --> 01:21:44,279
A little taste of the good life.

1245
01:21:44,321 --> 01:21:47,407
A little taste of honey.
Is that so bad? Is it?

1246
01:21:47,491 --> 01:21:50,202
But you win.

1247
01:21:50,285 --> 01:21:54,790
Man, I fold. I can see it:
Greed has hardened your heart.

1248
01:21:54,873 --> 01:21:57,501
And money's poisoned your soul.

1249
01:21:57,584 --> 01:21:59,294
I'm out of here.

1250
01:21:59,378 --> 01:22:02,339
There's nothing as dangerous
as large quantities of money.

1251
01:22:02,381 --> 01:22:06,468
That's why I've always remained an
independent contractor, an odd job man.

1252
01:22:06,510 --> 01:22:08,178
I want no part of this.

1253
01:22:09,263 --> 01:22:13,517
I stand before you, begging:
Take the arrow out of my back.

1254
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:15,561
You will never see me again.

1255
01:22:15,644 --> 01:22:20,065
Help me, God! Come on.

1256
01:22:20,148 --> 01:22:22,609
- Honey...

1257
01:22:22,693 --> 01:22:25,696
take the arrow out of his back.

1258
01:22:37,291 --> 01:22:39,126
Thank you.

1259
01:22:40,544 --> 01:22:44,131
- Thank you.
- Souvenir.

1260
01:23:40,646 --> 01:23:42,397
- Hey!
- Hey.

1261
01:23:43,774 --> 01:23:45,943
I couldn't sleep.
I got to talk to you.

1262
01:23:46,026 --> 01:23:47,569
Yeah, I got to talk to you too.

1263
01:23:47,653 --> 01:23:50,948
You know, this big rally tomorrow,
I'm a wreck about it.

1264
01:23:50,989 --> 01:23:54,368
I got to give a big speech.
I'm not a speech guy.

1265
01:23:54,451 --> 01:23:57,579
Are you kidding?
Come on, those infomercials you did.

1266
01:23:57,621 --> 01:23:59,206
You're great in front of people.

1267
01:23:59,289 --> 01:24:02,251
Really? You thought I was good?
You never said a word about it.

1268
01:24:03,293 --> 01:24:06,922
Because it was just another thing
of yours that made me miserable.

1269
01:24:07,005 --> 01:24:08,257
What?

1270
01:24:08,340 --> 01:24:10,801
This is what I have to talk
to you about. Sit down.

1271
01:24:15,013 --> 01:24:16,807
I killed Corky.

1272
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:19,768
You...

1273
01:24:23,105 --> 01:24:24,356
When?

1274
01:24:24,439 --> 01:24:27,776
Now, please, just don't say anything
till I'm done, all right?

1275
01:24:27,818 --> 01:24:30,195
The day that you gave me the wine,
remember?

1276
01:24:30,279 --> 01:24:32,614
I got drunk on the wine.

1277
01:24:32,656 --> 01:24:37,035
I actually was drunk from before.
I went into your yard and...

1278
01:24:49,214 --> 01:24:51,800
So that's it.
There you have it.

1279
01:24:53,385 --> 01:24:56,638
Well, you know, it sounds like
it was an accident.

1280
01:24:56,680 --> 01:24:59,224
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I should've told you.

1281
01:24:59,308 --> 01:25:02,227
That's the thing.
But I don't know what happened.

1282
01:25:02,311 --> 01:25:05,856
I felt guilty or something.

1283
01:25:05,939 --> 01:25:09,985
And I was just so wrapped up in the envy
that I felt for everything you had.

1284
01:25:10,068 --> 01:25:11,528
It's true what they say.

1285
01:25:11,612 --> 01:25:16,033
It's like a little green monster that
comes out and it just poisoned my head.

1286
01:25:16,074 --> 01:25:18,660
And, by the way, you did nothing wrong.

1287
01:25:18,744 --> 01:25:21,538
You followed your dream.
You did what you wanted to do.

1288
01:25:21,622 --> 01:25:24,666
I was always saying, "Don't do it."
You did it and it worked.

1289
01:25:24,708 --> 01:25:28,337
Look, you built a house, right?
That's all you did. You built a house.

1290
01:25:28,378 --> 01:25:31,924
I mean, it's a big house.
I mean, it's a really big house.

1291
01:25:32,007 --> 01:25:36,094
It's a large house.
It's a... I mean, it's...

1292
01:25:36,178 --> 01:25:39,973
It's gigantic, Nick.
It's the White House.

1293
01:25:40,057 --> 01:25:43,060
You built the White House here,
and we're in the shadow of it.

1294
01:25:43,143 --> 01:25:45,646
Literally, every day at 4:00,
we're in its shadow.

1295
01:25:45,729 --> 01:25:48,357
That's not your fault.
You wanted to be friends still,

1296
01:25:48,398 --> 01:25:50,317
you didn't want to move
and I love that.

1297
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:52,819
It was coming from such a good place,
but it was...

1298
01:25:52,903 --> 01:25:55,739
It really got to me because every day
I'd have to look at you,

1299
01:25:55,822 --> 01:25:57,658
and see you with all of this stuff.

1300
01:25:57,741 --> 01:26:01,870
You know, buy the yellow Lamborghini
that goes 500 miles an hour.

1301
01:26:01,954 --> 01:26:04,915
Have a bowling alley next to your room.
If I could do it, I would.

1302
01:26:04,957 --> 01:26:07,751
Everybody should have a merry-go-round.
Of course you should.

1303
01:26:07,835 --> 01:26:10,796
Jealousy, every day.
And it was just chewing me up.

1304
01:26:10,879 --> 01:26:14,174
Your kid's playing the concert piano,
my kid's banging trash cans.

1305
01:26:14,258 --> 01:26:15,968
And that has nothing to do with money.

1306
01:26:16,051 --> 01:26:19,137
That's just his musical ability.
That's a whole other thing.

1307
01:26:19,221 --> 01:26:22,558
You just gave to us. You gave
and you gave and you're so generous.

1308
01:26:22,599 --> 01:26:24,142
And what am I going to give you?

1309
01:26:24,226 --> 01:26:27,938
I gave you tube socks for Christmas
last year. That's not going to work.

1310
01:26:28,021 --> 01:26:30,065
- I like the socks.
- You gave us so much.

1311
01:26:30,107 --> 01:26:34,027
The coffee machine. It's a beautiful,
giant rocketship-sized coffee machine.

1312
01:26:34,111 --> 01:26:37,614
Debbie loved the coffee. I'll tell you
something, I never tasted it.

1313
01:26:37,698 --> 01:26:39,741
I wanted to tell you that.

1314
01:26:39,825 --> 01:26:42,327
I can't even tell you
I haven't tried the coffee.

1315
01:26:42,411 --> 01:26:44,830
Like I'll feel better
if I don't drink your coffee.

1316
01:26:44,913 --> 01:26:47,791
And you gave our kids flan.
All of a sudden my son's going,

1317
01:26:47,875 --> 01:26:49,585
"Daddy, where's the flan?"

1318
01:26:49,668 --> 01:26:52,796
It felt like a dagger in my heart
every time he'd request flan.

1319
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:54,381
It made me feel little.

1320
01:26:54,464 --> 01:26:57,342
I felt like a little man
who didn't like flan.

1321
01:26:57,426 --> 01:27:00,470
The horse was great, Nick.
Of course you should have a horse.

1322
01:27:00,554 --> 01:27:03,974
Does it have to be a white horse
that you come galloping up on,

1323
01:27:04,016 --> 01:27:05,893
and it neighs
and makes the whole thing?

1324
01:27:05,976 --> 01:27:10,314
Of course. Make it a beautiful horse
that I think, honestly, didn't like me.

1325
01:27:10,397 --> 01:27:13,192
It had nothing to do with anything,
I never clicked with it.

1326
01:27:13,275 --> 01:27:16,862
I think the horse sensed something.
I think "horse sense" is a real thing.

1327
01:27:16,945 --> 01:27:21,116
Because the horse had a feeling.
He came over and sensed the envy I felt.

1328
01:27:21,158 --> 01:27:25,037
He'd come over and eat the apples.
He'd see me and give me a weird look.

1329
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:29,541
I'm telling you. You know how sometimes
the side of a face and you get one eye?

1330
01:27:29,625 --> 01:27:32,586
He would keep the eye on me
and I knew he was thinking something.

1331
01:27:32,669 --> 01:27:36,131
That's unrelated to what happened
with the arrow. That was an accident.

1332
01:27:36,173 --> 01:27:39,134
I swear to God. I swear to God.
I couldn't do it if I tried.

1333
01:27:39,176 --> 01:27:44,056
I'm sorry about this.
I feel horrible. I feel bad.

1334
01:27:44,139 --> 01:27:47,809
I feel like I have this fountain
in my yard that I don't deserve.

1335
01:27:47,893 --> 01:27:50,020
I don't deserve to be your partner.

1336
01:27:51,104 --> 01:27:54,316
I don't deserve to be your friend.
I just...

1337
01:27:54,358 --> 01:27:57,110
Well, you know what, Tim?
You made a mistake.

1338
01:27:57,194 --> 01:27:59,821
You're human.
Everyone makes mistakes.

1339
01:28:00,364 --> 01:28:03,033
So what, man?
You're still my best friend.

1340
01:28:03,116 --> 01:28:05,494
- Really?
- Of course.

1341
01:28:07,162 --> 01:28:10,040
Of course. Come on, man.

1342
01:28:10,123 --> 01:28:12,084
It was a big mistake.

1343
01:28:12,167 --> 01:28:15,671
It was a big mistake.
It was a doozy.

1344
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:18,382
Corky.

1345
01:28:18,465 --> 01:28:21,176
- I'm sorry, Nick.
- No, no. It's okay.

1346
01:28:21,218 --> 01:28:23,512
I know how much
you loved him and l...

1347
01:28:23,554 --> 01:28:26,640
I did love Corky.

1348
01:28:26,723 --> 01:28:28,559
I never liked Corky.

1349
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:31,937
I mean, he's beautiful on the outside.
It's just something wasn't...

1350
01:28:32,020 --> 01:28:33,272
We're still partners.

1351
01:28:33,355 --> 01:28:36,525
There is no way you are getting out
of this partnership.

1352
01:28:36,567 --> 01:28:38,277
- Okay.
- Okay?

1353
01:28:38,360 --> 01:28:40,529
And I will see you tomorrow
at the big rally.

1354
01:28:42,072 --> 01:28:43,615
- Yeah.
- Good.

1355
01:28:44,950 --> 01:28:46,577
Big day.

1356
01:28:46,660 --> 01:28:48,495
Big day.

1357
01:28:48,579 --> 01:28:51,081
Poor Corky.
One little target arrow.

1358
01:28:51,164 --> 01:28:53,709
You wouldn't think that could kill
a great big horse.

1359
01:28:53,792 --> 01:28:55,544
That's exactly what I thought.

1360
01:28:55,586 --> 01:28:58,213
It's one little arrow
and when I shot the bum...

1361
01:28:58,255 --> 01:29:00,591
he hardly seemed to notice.

1362
01:29:02,259 --> 01:29:05,220
You know, that fountain
looked a lot better in Rome.

1363
01:29:07,931 --> 01:29:09,725
- Yeah.
- Well...

1364
01:29:09,766 --> 01:29:13,478
C'est la vie, as the Romans say.

1365
01:29:17,858 --> 01:29:20,402
On this beautiful, clear day,

1366
01:29:20,485 --> 01:29:23,906
I think it is appropriate
that we clear the air

1367
01:29:23,947 --> 01:29:31,079
of the toxic distortions that
my husband and, by association, myself,

1368
01:29:31,163 --> 01:29:36,793
are somehow poisoning our environment
in our efforts to purify it.

1369
01:29:36,877 --> 01:29:40,422
It's not true. No es verdad.

1370
01:29:41,924 --> 01:29:43,634
Ladies and gentlemen...

1371
01:29:43,717 --> 01:29:46,803
please help me welcome
Nick Vanderpark and Tim Dingman.

1372
01:30:01,902 --> 01:30:03,278
Thank you.

1373
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:06,990
Ladies and gentlemen, young people.

1374
01:30:07,658 --> 01:30:10,619
I stand here with my partner,
Tim Dingman...

1375
01:30:12,371 --> 01:30:13,956
That's right.

1376
01:30:15,582 --> 01:30:19,628
...grateful for this opportunity
to address the central question

1377
01:30:19,711 --> 01:30:25,300
posed in so many colorful
and eloquent variations.

1378
01:30:26,218 --> 01:30:31,348
Where is the shit?!

1379
01:30:34,434 --> 01:30:37,354
My God. Nick. Nick!

1380
01:30:37,396 --> 01:30:39,064
Corky?

1381
01:30:41,692 --> 01:30:44,987
Mr. and Mrs. Vanderpark,
sorry we had to perform an autopsy,

1382
01:30:45,028 --> 01:30:48,323
but when any large dead animal
comes in proximity with the public

1383
01:30:48,407 --> 01:30:51,034
it must be examined immediately
for health reasons.

1384
01:30:51,118 --> 01:30:54,204
I'm a little curious. Did you feed
your horse a lot of apples?

1385
01:30:54,288 --> 01:30:58,542
Our neighbors have an apple tree.
Corky loved their apples.

1386
01:30:58,625 --> 01:31:01,587
- Did he ever defecate in their yard?
- I imagine.

1387
01:31:02,838 --> 01:31:06,049
Can you tell me what you did
when the horse defecated in your yard?

1388
01:31:06,133 --> 01:31:10,345
We used Vapoorize
because Nick invented it.

1389
01:31:10,429 --> 01:31:12,723
We get crates of it for free.

1390
01:31:12,764 --> 01:31:14,516
Well...

1391
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:16,685
It's all making sense.

1392
01:31:18,854 --> 01:31:20,647
The horse was poisoned.

1393
01:31:20,731 --> 01:31:24,735
We did find a broken shaft of
a small target arrow in the sternum,

1394
01:31:24,818 --> 01:31:27,529
but that played no part
in the horse's death.

1395
01:31:27,571 --> 01:31:32,075
The horse died from the prolonged
ingesting of a certain chemical,

1396
01:31:32,159 --> 01:31:36,580
which by itself is harmless, but when
combined with certain fecal bacteria

1397
01:31:36,622 --> 01:31:38,707
becomes a lethal poison.

1398
01:31:40,209 --> 01:31:41,793
A little person?

1399
01:31:41,877 --> 01:31:44,254
Lethal poison.

1400
01:31:44,296 --> 01:31:48,926
That chemical is the ingredient in every
can of your so-called miracle invention.

1401
01:31:49,009 --> 01:31:51,512
He had enough of it literally
to kill a horse.

1402
01:31:55,140 --> 01:31:58,352
I am obligated, of course,
to report this to the EPA.

1403
01:32:00,062 --> 01:32:01,647
EPA?

1404
01:32:01,730 --> 01:32:03,190
Mmm-hmm.

1405
01:32:03,273 --> 01:32:06,944
Environmental Protection Agency?

1406
01:32:07,027 --> 01:32:10,447
Do you have to do that?
Right. You have to.

1407
01:32:12,866 --> 01:32:16,662
- It's all right.
- Every time without exception?

1408
01:32:26,839 --> 01:32:31,593
The next item, an extra
large bed that sleeps nine comfortably,

1409
01:32:31,635 --> 01:32:33,971
for, let's say, $1 00.

1410
01:32:34,054 --> 01:32:38,100
XL bed, sleeping nine.
Got to love it for $1 00.

1411
01:32:38,183 --> 01:32:42,896
$72 for this white statue of a man
on a horse with a spray can.

1412
01:32:42,980 --> 01:32:44,523
$72, anyone? No?

1413
01:32:45,816 --> 01:32:48,235
Anybody need a portable phone?
Everyone needs one.

1414
01:32:48,318 --> 01:32:50,863
You want one in your kitchen,
in your extra bedroom.

1415
01:32:50,946 --> 01:32:54,199
You got a portable phone right there.
It's going to go for $5.

1416
01:32:54,283 --> 01:32:55,826
The next thing is item 31.

1417
01:32:55,909 --> 01:33:00,289
I like this bug net. Why don't we
find out the estimated cost?

1418
01:33:00,956 --> 01:33:06,336
Oh, we've got two cases
of a semi-gourmet flan.

1419
01:33:06,378 --> 01:33:10,424
I believe that's some sort of
custard dish or something.

1420
01:33:10,507 --> 01:33:15,053
The semi-gourmet flan
is going to start the bidding at $4.

1421
01:33:15,137 --> 01:33:17,347
- Nick?
- Yeah.

1422
01:33:19,308 --> 01:33:21,894
I think I have an idea.

1423
01:33:21,977 --> 01:33:25,105
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Like a really big idea.

1424
01:33:25,189 --> 01:33:26,064
Really?

1425
01:33:26,148 --> 01:33:28,734
When you got your idea,
did you feel it immediately?

1426
01:33:28,817 --> 01:33:30,527
Oh, yeah. Right away.

1427
01:33:30,611 --> 01:33:32,613
You got one of those?
Like one of my ideas?

1428
01:33:32,696 --> 01:33:35,073
- I think so.
- What is it?

1429
01:33:41,705 --> 01:33:42,998
Yes!

1430
01:33:44,958 --> 01:33:47,628
Hey. Hey! Stop the auction!

1431
01:33:50,130 --> 01:33:54,551
You just cannot eat flan
and drive at the same time.

1432
01:33:54,593 --> 01:33:57,137
Look, I've got flan all over me.

1433
01:33:57,221 --> 01:33:59,598
Can't somebody come up
with a better idea?!

1434
01:33:59,681 --> 01:34:01,600
- We have.

1435
01:34:01,683 --> 01:34:03,143
That's right!

1436
01:34:03,894 --> 01:34:08,232
Be one of the millions enjoying the
taste sensation sweeping the nation.

1437
01:34:08,273 --> 01:34:10,275
Nick's talking about Pocket Flan!

1438
01:34:10,359 --> 01:34:11,777
Pocket Flan!

1439
01:34:12,819 --> 01:34:15,572
- No spoon, no mess!
- That's right.

1440
01:34:15,656 --> 01:34:17,074
Three simple steps, folks.

1441
01:34:17,157 --> 01:34:19,326
- Just flip it!
- Flip it!

1442
01:34:19,409 --> 01:34:21,245
- Squeeze it!
- Squeeze it!

1443
01:34:21,328 --> 01:34:23,205
Mmm.

1444
01:34:23,247 --> 01:34:25,791
- And enjoy.
- Enjoy!

1445
01:34:25,874 --> 01:34:28,544
Wait a second, Tim.
What was that name again?

1446
01:34:28,627 --> 01:34:30,587
Pocket Flan!

1447
01:34:30,671 --> 01:34:32,172
Isn't that just fantastic?

1448
01:34:32,256 --> 01:34:35,092
No, Nick, it's not fantastic.
It's flan-tastic.

1449
01:34:36,635 --> 01:34:39,930
Yeah, but, Tim, Nick, I have a question.

1450
01:34:39,972 --> 01:34:43,392
How about us
who are lactose-intolerant?

1451
01:34:43,433 --> 01:34:46,520
We've got a new soy-based Pocket Flan.

1452
01:35:37,821 --> 01:35:39,656
It's flan in a tube.

1453
01:35:39,698 --> 01:35:41,575
It's a little bit of happiness
in a tube.

1454
01:35:41,658 --> 01:35:43,452
Let's say I'm jogging.

1455
01:35:43,493 --> 01:35:47,956
I'm getting tired, I need a pick-me-up.
What am I going to do, get a candy bar?

1456
01:35:47,998 --> 01:35:51,335
Imagine if you're jogging
with some of this stuff.

1457
01:35:51,376 --> 01:35:53,462
What's going on?
It's not going to work.

1458
01:35:53,504 --> 01:35:56,423
Here's the other thing.
You're eating your flan, you're like:

1459
01:35:56,507 --> 01:35:57,508
"That's good.

1460
01:35:57,591 --> 01:36:00,802
"l want to get down there
where it's brown and super-sugary."

1461
01:36:00,844 --> 01:36:03,722
Where do you...? I can't...
In here we've mixed it up.

1462
01:36:03,805 --> 01:36:05,849
You've got all that. It's pre-mixed.

1463
01:36:05,933 --> 01:36:08,894
The brown is always part of it.
Even if you don't see it.

1464
01:36:08,977 --> 01:36:12,648
In the Tour de France, they're going
20 miles a day, going up mountains.

1465
01:36:12,731 --> 01:36:15,692
What do you think they pull out
of their Spandex bikini bottom

1466
01:36:15,734 --> 01:36:18,111
to squeeze into their mouth
when they want to eat?

1467
01:36:18,195 --> 01:36:21,532
- Pocket Flan!
- And here's another question.

1468
01:36:21,573 --> 01:36:24,493
What if I'm doing
some skydiving and I'm like:

1469
01:36:24,535 --> 01:36:27,162
"l got to get some...
I'm going to get some cornflakes.

1470
01:36:27,204 --> 01:36:30,290
"l don't have time for cornflakes.
I do have time for flan."

1471
01:36:30,374 --> 01:36:32,709
That's right.
I'd love to see this...

1472
01:36:33,669 --> 01:36:35,295
This has been vacuum-tested

1473
01:36:35,379 --> 01:36:38,340
to a depth of 200 feet
if you're scuba diving.

1474
01:36:38,423 --> 01:36:41,426
Just the other day I see
this kid walking down the street.

1475
01:36:41,510 --> 01:36:43,929
- He has the Pocket Flan. Right?
- Right.

1476
01:36:44,012 --> 01:36:47,391
He squeezes it... he's on a skateboard.
He squeezes it...

1477
01:36:47,432 --> 01:36:50,644
It arcs up. He goes like... and...

1478
01:36:50,727 --> 01:36:52,729
That's like a new skateboard trick.

1479
01:36:52,813 --> 01:36:56,149
Who here likes to drive?
You guys like to drive? Yeah.

1480
01:36:56,233 --> 01:36:59,069
Who here likes to drive race cars?
Anybody? All right.

1481
01:36:59,152 --> 01:37:01,029
I'm Captain Speedway,

1482
01:37:01,071 --> 01:37:06,201
and nothing tastes better at 200 miles
per hour than Pocket Flan.

1483
01:37:06,285 --> 01:37:10,581
Firemen. "l got to go save someone.
Maybe I need a little extra something."

1484
01:37:10,664 --> 01:37:13,876
"Where am I gonna put my hose?
I can't hold the hose and this thing.

1485
01:37:13,959 --> 01:37:15,961
- "Where's the hose go?

1486
01:37:16,044 --> 01:37:18,630
"l put a hose under my arm
and then I fight the fire."

1487
01:37:18,714 --> 01:37:21,091
This is on a serious note.

1488
01:37:21,175 --> 01:37:27,556
Recently we received a letter
from a woman, Gladys, who...

1489
01:37:28,640 --> 01:37:30,517
well, Pocket Flan saved her life.

1490
01:37:30,601 --> 01:37:33,270
- All right.

1491
01:37:33,353 --> 01:37:36,899
She was a backpacker.
She was stuck out in the woods...

1492
01:37:36,982 --> 01:37:39,484
and, by God, Pocket Flan...

1493
01:37:39,568 --> 01:37:41,653
I can't think of it.

1494
01:37:41,737 --> 01:37:45,407
I wanted to say some tearful thing,
but I couldn't think of a thing.
