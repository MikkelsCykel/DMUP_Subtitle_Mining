1
00:00:21,168 --> 00:00:24,331
For weeks, rumors have
spread across Mars...

2
00:00:24,404 --> 00:00:26,838
from outposts to settlements...

3
00:00:26,907 --> 00:00:29,000
from town to town.

4
00:00:29,076 --> 00:00:33,706
Something that had been buried for
centuries has just been uncovered.

5
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,274
And as this mysterious force
moves across the southern valley...

6
00:00:38,352 --> 00:00:40,946
it leaves behind only silence...

7
00:00:41,021 --> 00:00:42,784
and death.

8
00:02:33,967 --> 00:02:36,128
Take your seats, please.

9
00:02:46,813 --> 00:02:48,644
I just talked with the Cartel.

10
00:02:48,715 --> 00:02:50,706
They're concerned that the rumors
are getting out of control.

11
00:02:50,784 --> 00:02:53,651
They'd like to make a statement
in two hours.

12
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,985
Some of you may not know
we've had another incident.

13
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,115
At 1520 hours yesterday,
a freight train...

14
00:02:59,226 --> 00:03:01,558
Trans Marineris 74 Yankee...

15
00:03:01,628 --> 00:03:04,620
returned from the southern valley
on autopilot.

16
00:03:04,731 --> 00:03:07,291
Get to your security stations now!

17
00:03:17,277 --> 00:03:18,539
Let's move.

18
00:03:25,886 --> 00:03:28,878
Initial reports indicated
it was a ghost train.

19
00:03:28,955 --> 00:03:30,547
It appeared no one was aboard...

20
00:03:30,657 --> 00:03:34,093
until a single survivor was
discovered in the rear compartment.

21
00:03:34,194 --> 00:03:36,059
Call for a med tech backup.

22
00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:38,120
Lieutenant Melanie Ballard...

23
00:03:38,231 --> 00:03:41,325
second officer,
first squad of escort police.

24
00:03:41,401 --> 00:03:43,335
They were assigned
to transfer a prisoner...

25
00:03:43,403 --> 00:03:46,395
from the jail at Shining Canyon Mine
back here to Chryse.

26
00:03:47,707 --> 00:03:50,676
Lieutenant Ballard was taken
to hospital under guard.

27
00:03:51,411 --> 00:03:54,903
She had superficial wounds, but was
in otherwise good physical condition.

28
00:03:54,981 --> 00:03:58,883
However, traces of an illegal
substance, tetramonochloride...

29
00:03:58,952 --> 00:04:00,943
were found in her system.

30
00:04:02,956 --> 00:04:04,082
Bring her in, please.

31
00:04:17,137 --> 00:04:19,128
Lieutenant Ballard,
please be seated.

32
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:23,776
Do I get a lawyer, or don't police
officers have rights these days?

33
00:04:23,843 --> 00:04:27,210
Representation by counsel
won't be necessary.

34
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,181
Your rights are protected
by the Matronage.

35
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,877
You can speak freely.

36
00:04:31,952 --> 00:04:34,614
- Then I'm not being charged?
- Sit down, Lieutenant.

37
00:04:34,688 --> 00:04:36,178
This is a discovery hearing...

38
00:04:36,256 --> 00:04:39,453
and your presence is required
as ranking officer.

39
00:04:39,559 --> 00:04:41,720
I want your after-action report.

40
00:04:41,828 --> 00:04:45,127
Where's the rest of your team,
the prisoner you picked up?

41
00:04:45,198 --> 00:04:47,598
What happened at Shining Canyon?

42
00:04:48,902 --> 00:04:53,566
Last Friday at 1750, we were
slamming through a dust storm...

43
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,972
on the edge of the southern valley.

44
00:04:57,344 --> 00:04:59,175
74 Yankee was an ore hauler...

45
00:04:59,245 --> 00:05:01,509
servicing the mines
in the outer sector.

46
00:05:02,816 --> 00:05:06,411
My squad was hitching a ride
into Shining Canyon.

47
00:05:06,486 --> 00:05:08,113
You beat me.

48
00:05:08,788 --> 00:05:11,757
- Looks like you played tarts before.
- No, I've never done this.

49
00:05:12,659 --> 00:05:15,150
Let's spin 'em again.
One down and one up.

50
00:05:20,367 --> 00:05:22,096
Fuck me! The five of bats.

51
00:05:22,168 --> 00:05:24,762
You got the wheel up.
What's your wager?

52
00:05:24,838 --> 00:05:26,931
Five bucks.

53
00:05:33,446 --> 00:05:35,778
Helena? Hey.

54
00:05:35,849 --> 00:05:37,612
Sorry.

55
00:05:37,684 --> 00:05:40,414
Weather station's tracking a huge
storm across the southern sector...

56
00:05:40,487 --> 00:05:42,512
and we're right under it by now.

57
00:05:45,825 --> 00:05:48,259
- What's the mark on it?
- 3,200 kliks.

58
00:05:48,328 --> 00:05:50,523
We should be there by 1800.

59
00:05:56,436 --> 00:05:58,700
Just let me know
if you need anything.

60
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:52,181
You high?

61
00:06:53,426 --> 00:06:55,360
Fuck, Helena, it's just clear.

62
00:06:55,428 --> 00:06:58,363
I'll be straighter than this track
long before we hit the canyon.

63
00:06:58,465 --> 00:07:01,992
You better be. This prisoner
transfer is no sleepwalk.

64
00:07:02,068 --> 00:07:05,697
- We're picking up James Williams.
- You mean "Desolation" Williams?

65
00:07:05,772 --> 00:07:08,400
Cooling his heels
in the Shining Canyon jail.

66
00:07:08,475 --> 00:07:10,534
Deep solitary.

67
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:14,341
- What's the charge this time?
- Murder.

68
00:07:14,948 --> 00:07:18,111
The man's been up on murder three times.
He gets off every time on self-defense.

69
00:07:18,184 --> 00:07:21,119
It's different this time.
Sounds like he finally went psycho.

70
00:07:21,187 --> 00:07:24,350
Beaucoup corpses, all mutilated.

71
00:07:24,457 --> 00:07:27,824
Williams shows up at the mine
with some bizarre-ass story.

72
00:07:27,894 --> 00:07:31,830
Sends three officers to the medevac
before they locked him down.

73
00:07:31,931 --> 00:07:35,389
- You starting to see the picture?
- And all we got is you, me...

74
00:07:35,468 --> 00:07:37,595
and this new guy Jericho
and a couple of rookies?

75
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:39,968
What do you think
of Sergeant Jericho?

76
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:43,440
I was hoping we'd get a good,
solid woman we could count on.

77
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:45,876
I don't know.
I guess we'll see.

78
00:07:47,046 --> 00:07:49,742
Well...

79
00:07:49,816 --> 00:07:53,149
I need you straight, Melanie.

80
00:07:54,721 --> 00:07:57,281
Don't worry about that,
Commander.

81
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,449
I'm as straight as they come.

82
00:07:59,559 --> 00:08:01,527
Such a shame.

83
00:08:04,998 --> 00:08:06,761
Check on
our transfer schedule.

84
00:08:07,667 --> 00:08:10,295
Shining Canyon.

85
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:14,568
Shining Canyon,
this is Trans Marineris 74 Yankee.

86
00:08:14,641 --> 00:08:15,938
They ready for us?

87
00:08:16,009 --> 00:08:18,842
This storm's really kicking up a mess.
I can't get through to the tower.

88
00:08:18,912 --> 00:08:20,937
Here's your coffee, Mr. McSimms.
Three sugars and two whites.

89
00:08:21,014 --> 00:08:23,505
Just the way you like it.
You want some?

90
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:26,017
No, thanks.
How long?

91
00:08:27,387 --> 00:08:29,378
About 40.

92
00:08:29,455 --> 00:08:31,320
Shining Canyon.

93
00:08:31,424 --> 00:08:34,018
Shining Canyon, this is
Trans Marineris 74 Yankee.

94
00:08:34,127 --> 00:08:36,186
ETA, 40 minutes.

95
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:40,593
Everybody check your equipment.
I don't want any surprises.

96
00:08:43,002 --> 00:08:46,028
Is everything all right,
Lieutenant?

97
00:08:46,105 --> 00:08:49,370
I couldn't help but notice that charming
little scene with the queen bee.

98
00:08:49,442 --> 00:08:52,036
Yeah, well, you know how
the service is, Sergeant.

99
00:08:52,111 --> 00:08:55,512
She figures if I want to make captain,
I'll have to pay the price.

100
00:08:55,582 --> 00:08:58,449
Thing is, I don't give a damn
about wearing another bar.

101
00:08:58,518 --> 00:09:00,383
It could be that.

102
00:09:00,453 --> 00:09:03,650
Or maybe she just has
good taste in women.

103
00:09:03,756 --> 00:09:06,691
Sergeant, you are
seriously out of line.

104
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:08,784
I'd hate to spoil my record.

105
00:09:08,895 --> 00:09:13,332
All right. I know you think
you're some pretty tough hombres.

106
00:09:14,901 --> 00:09:17,995
You've had the best training.
You have the best gear.

107
00:09:18,071 --> 00:09:21,006
You probably think this is
some routine prisoner transfer.

108
00:09:21,074 --> 00:09:22,871
But that's what I want
to bang into your heads.

109
00:09:22,942 --> 00:09:25,137
There's nothing routine
about this prisoner.

110
00:09:25,211 --> 00:09:28,669
We are here to pick up
James "Desolation" Williams.

111
00:09:28,748 --> 00:09:31,546
I want you all jack-ready
and double tough.

112
00:09:54,307 --> 00:09:56,832
Officers, you can disembark here.

113
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:58,577
What time is departure?

114
00:09:58,645 --> 00:10:00,840
We need at least half an hour
to secure our prisoner.

115
00:10:00,914 --> 00:10:02,506
We got about
a four-hour turnaround...

116
00:10:02,582 --> 00:10:05,983
and we'll be back
at this spot at about 2200.

117
00:10:06,052 --> 00:10:07,952
You can re-board any time after that.

118
00:10:08,021 --> 00:10:10,353
See if you can raise
the yard master, will ya?

119
00:10:10,456 --> 00:10:14,517
Ed? Ed, you out there?

120
00:10:14,627 --> 00:10:16,219
Rookies, use your breathers.

121
00:10:16,329 --> 00:10:19,958
We're not gonna have air like Earth
for ten more years. Let's go.

122
00:10:43,856 --> 00:10:47,383
- God, I hate this thing.
- You'll get used to it.

123
00:10:47,493 --> 00:10:50,724
Two years ago, we were still
wearing full-face breathers.

124
00:10:50,797 --> 00:10:52,924
It takes about a month to get over
the headaches out here.

125
00:10:54,801 --> 00:10:58,897
So this is Shining Canyon?
God, what a dump.

126
00:10:58,972 --> 00:11:01,964
- First time in the boonies, rookie?
- Standard layout.

127
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:04,339
Just another shitty boomtown
like all the others.

128
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:06,139
Seen one, you can go home.

129
00:11:06,212 --> 00:11:08,180
You're always cold,
you can't get a decent shower...

130
00:11:08,247 --> 00:11:11,080
and they don't tell you
that a one-year contract here...

131
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:13,516
equals two years' Earth time.

132
00:11:13,586 --> 00:11:15,520
You gotta read the fine print.

133
00:11:22,295 --> 00:11:23,728
Where is everybody?

134
00:11:24,797 --> 00:11:27,766
Yeah. Friday night,
the place should be packed.

135
00:11:27,834 --> 00:11:30,826
A whole 12 hours before sun up,
and there's money to burn...

136
00:11:30,903 --> 00:11:34,361
whores to fuck
and drugs to take.

137
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,499
Instead, we got a graveyard.

138
00:11:38,478 --> 00:11:41,572
Maybe they're all inside,
spending their money.

139
00:11:41,647 --> 00:11:43,342
Mel, I'll get us squared away
at the rec-fac.

140
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:45,976
You and Sergeant Jericho
check in at the jail.

141
00:11:47,286 --> 00:11:49,447
Save some hot water for me.

142
00:11:52,658 --> 00:11:54,853
Where were you before Chryse?

143
00:11:54,961 --> 00:11:57,395
Utopia.

144
00:11:57,463 --> 00:11:59,829
It's the arse end of the universe.

145
00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:03,266
A penal camp full of
work-amnesty cutthroats.

146
00:12:03,336 --> 00:12:05,065
Sounds nasty...

147
00:12:05,138 --> 00:12:07,902
but you seem to be
holding together all right.

148
00:12:07,974 --> 00:12:10,442
What you see is nothing.

149
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:13,035
I have numerous
hidden talents.

150
00:12:29,529 --> 00:12:31,019
Need some help with that?

151
00:12:31,697 --> 00:12:34,495
You're persistent, aren't you?

152
00:12:34,567 --> 00:12:37,229
I've changed a few minds
in my time.

153
00:12:37,303 --> 00:12:40,500
There's not many
of us breeders around.

154
00:12:40,573 --> 00:12:43,736
I'd hate to miss a chance
to give it a go.

155
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:45,607
What do you say?

156
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,113
Hello!

157
00:12:56,989 --> 00:12:58,889
Anybody here?

158
00:13:15,475 --> 00:13:17,568
Officer to front desk.

159
00:13:28,121 --> 00:13:30,885
Well, hello, Mr. Williams.

160
00:13:35,461 --> 00:13:37,725
No one seems to be about.
What do you make of it?

161
00:13:37,797 --> 00:13:38,855
I don't know.

162
00:13:38,965 --> 00:13:41,263
Do you want me to pop the lock
and ask the prisoners?

163
00:13:41,334 --> 00:13:44,098
What do you mean, pop the lock?
That's a level-eight security door.

164
00:13:45,204 --> 00:13:48,571
I've got a mystical way with
locks and mechanical objects.

165
00:13:48,641 --> 00:13:50,836
There isn't a machine on Mars
that doesn't love me.

166
00:13:51,844 --> 00:13:54,506
How about we check with
the commander first?

167
00:13:58,217 --> 00:14:02,017
So what do you do for fun then?
Are you a gambler?

168
00:14:02,088 --> 00:14:06,684
No. I'm short-time, Sergeant.
I believe in saving my money.

169
00:14:08,161 --> 00:14:11,790
Don't worry about that.
I was gonna do it for free.

170
00:14:13,099 --> 00:14:15,226
Let me put it this way.

171
00:14:15,301 --> 00:14:17,667
Maybe I'd sleep with you
if you were the last man on Earth.

172
00:14:19,372 --> 00:14:21,397
But we're not on Earth.

173
00:14:25,144 --> 00:14:27,806
It's a voltage overload,
most likely.

174
00:14:28,548 --> 00:14:30,778
You want to check it out?

175
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:32,477
It's probably nothing.

176
00:14:33,819 --> 00:14:35,582
But on second thought--

177
00:15:20,099 --> 00:15:22,567
Police officer.
Anybody there?

178
00:15:49,695 --> 00:15:51,526
Shit!

179
00:16:08,581 --> 00:16:11,414
- This is not making me happy.
- It's time to get backup.

180
00:16:43,749 --> 00:16:46,946
Jesus Christ.
What are you doing?

181
00:16:48,287 --> 00:16:51,916
- I almost killed you.
- What's going on?

182
00:16:52,024 --> 00:16:55,653
- Rec-fac's a slaughterhouse.
- What?

183
00:16:55,761 --> 00:16:57,251
Slaughterhouse?

184
00:16:58,297 --> 00:17:02,996
That's the word Descanso used.
I didn't see it myself.

185
00:17:03,069 --> 00:17:04,798
According to what
Commander Braddock told me...

186
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:07,430
right after we first arrived
in Shining Canyon...

187
00:17:07,506 --> 00:17:11,465
she and the two rookies headed
towards the recreation facility.

188
00:17:11,544 --> 00:17:13,512
Mel, I'll get us squared away
at the rec-fac.

189
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:16,275
You and Sergeant Jericho
go and check in at the jail.

190
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:18,283
Save some hot water for me.

191
00:17:42,074 --> 00:17:45,009
Descanso, sweep left.

192
00:17:45,878 --> 00:17:47,812
Bashira, stick with me.

193
00:18:04,296 --> 00:18:06,196
Officer to train,
do you read?

194
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,530
The casino, barracks, dining hall,
rec center, no one alive anywhere.

195
00:18:13,272 --> 00:18:15,900
- Commander.
- What?

196
00:18:17,343 --> 00:18:21,245
- I can't reach the train.
- Well, keep trying.

197
00:18:25,284 --> 00:18:26,376
How are we doing?

198
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,585
I don't know. This thing
was built to stay locked.

199
00:18:29,655 --> 00:18:31,714
And Williams
is still locked up?

200
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:34,092
What do you mean?

201
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,924
Williams was arrested
on the suspicion of murdering...

202
00:18:36,996 --> 00:18:40,830
six rail workers and a payroll courier
up at Klik 305 Hub Station.

203
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:45,166
The bodies were hung and decapitated,
just like the bodies in the rec-fac.

204
00:18:46,639 --> 00:18:48,368
So how'd they pin that
on Desolation?

205
00:18:48,441 --> 00:18:50,136
He showed up here
with the courier's payroll.

206
00:18:50,209 --> 00:18:52,268
The cashier realized
it was a stolen scrip.

207
00:18:52,344 --> 00:18:54,335
They made the arrest.

208
00:18:54,413 --> 00:18:57,109
There's got to be a day log
here somewhere.

209
00:18:58,417 --> 00:18:59,816
Sergeant's desk.

210
00:19:09,195 --> 00:19:10,924
Here.

211
00:19:13,766 --> 00:19:16,929
Last night the mine called in
a work stoppage.

212
00:19:17,002 --> 00:19:19,493
Reported winds
gusting up to 60 knots.

213
00:19:19,572 --> 00:19:21,597
- Sixty?
- That's what it says.

214
00:19:22,274 --> 00:19:23,741
Anything else?

215
00:19:23,809 --> 00:19:26,744
Arrest for theft, then nothing.

216
00:19:29,114 --> 00:19:30,809
Got it.

217
00:19:56,575 --> 00:19:57,837
What's going on around here?

218
00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:01,676
We haven't had a meal
or a piss break in six hours.

219
00:20:01,747 --> 00:20:04,079
Descanso, open the door.

220
00:20:04,149 --> 00:20:06,447
All right, everybody, answer "here"
when I call your name.

221
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:08,146
- Akooshay.
- What?

222
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,812
Just answer "here."

223
00:20:09,889 --> 00:20:11,618
- Yeah.
- Zimmerman.

224
00:20:11,724 --> 00:20:13,658
I'm right in front of you.

225
00:20:13,726 --> 00:20:15,023
Benchley.

226
00:20:16,829 --> 00:20:20,162
- Who's that?
- She showed up last night.

227
00:20:21,133 --> 00:20:24,694
Checked herself in. Insisted on
being locked up here with us.

228
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:26,738
Well, wake her up, sunshine.

229
00:20:26,805 --> 00:20:28,898
Let's see what she has to say.

230
00:20:32,144 --> 00:20:34,305
Somebody wants to talk to you.

231
00:20:35,381 --> 00:20:38,214
- Who are you?
- Whitlock.

232
00:20:38,284 --> 00:20:40,912
What are you doing
in the holding tank, Whitlock?

233
00:20:42,454 --> 00:20:45,048
It's the only safe place
at the moment, okay?

234
00:20:45,157 --> 00:20:47,352
- Can I go back to sleep now?
- No, you can't!

235
00:20:47,459 --> 00:20:50,724
I need answers.
What's going on out there?

236
00:20:54,066 --> 00:20:55,499
What's your I.D.?

237
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:01,362
Dr. Arlene Whitlock.
I'm the Spec Six science officer...

238
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,274
in charge of the mining operation
at Drucker's Ridge.

239
00:21:05,978 --> 00:21:10,608
I left Drucker's about a week ago
with a weather balloon I'd modified.

240
00:21:10,683 --> 00:21:16,087
There was a disturbance in town.
It seemed prudent to get out.

241
00:21:16,155 --> 00:21:19,124
They said there was a riot
and the place was destroyed.

242
00:21:19,191 --> 00:21:21,125
Yeah, something like that.

243
00:21:21,193 --> 00:21:24,356
I was adrift for several days,
you know.

244
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:26,261
Ran out of food.

245
00:21:26,332 --> 00:21:29,768
I followed the railroad tracks
until I got here.

246
00:21:29,835 --> 00:21:31,666
Oh, shit.

247
00:21:31,737 --> 00:21:33,932
Then the storm forced me too low.

248
00:21:35,608 --> 00:21:37,838
I hit a windmill and crashed.

249
00:21:51,023 --> 00:21:53,491
And they were kind enough
to take me in here.

250
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:55,493
Well, wasn't that nice of them.

251
00:21:56,362 --> 00:22:00,298
Mel, Jericho,
go check out Williams.

252
00:22:00,399 --> 00:22:02,094
See if he knows anything
about this.

253
00:22:08,974 --> 00:22:12,842
Williams, do you know
what's going on outside?

254
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:20,317
Are you aware of
what's going on outside?

255
00:22:22,154 --> 00:22:26,113
Let's go. This asshole
doesn't know anything either.

256
00:22:40,339 --> 00:22:42,364
You got some balls, calling him
an asshole to his face.

257
00:22:42,441 --> 00:22:44,375
That's Desolation Williams.

258
00:22:44,443 --> 00:22:47,708
I heard he took out at least six when
they cornered him at Deimos Station.

259
00:22:48,881 --> 00:22:52,282
And this is eight inches.
You men love to exaggerate.

260
00:22:52,351 --> 00:22:53,818
Just goes with the territory.

261
00:22:54,787 --> 00:22:57,881
Yeah, well, in my case,
it's a bit different.

262
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:01,391
Perhaps a connoisseur like yourself
would appreciate what I have to offer.

263
00:23:27,986 --> 00:23:29,920
Go get the commander.

264
00:24:03,155 --> 00:24:05,089
Disarm her.

265
00:24:16,235 --> 00:24:18,396
Officer.

266
00:24:20,939 --> 00:24:23,840
It was almost like she was...

267
00:24:23,909 --> 00:24:26,400
possessed.

268
00:24:26,478 --> 00:24:28,844
Like there was some kind
of force inside her.

269
00:24:28,914 --> 00:24:32,907
- Who was she?
- She was a dispatch officer.

270
00:24:32,985 --> 00:24:35,920
We tried to make her comfortable.

271
00:24:35,988 --> 00:24:39,549
The rookies took her to a storage
room in the back of the jail.

272
00:24:39,658 --> 00:24:43,219
Then the commander and I went
back outside to look around town.

273
00:24:44,696 --> 00:24:48,996
- What do you think?
- That the science officer is lying.

274
00:24:49,067 --> 00:24:52,798
- Tell me again about Williams.
- I didn't read the full file.

275
00:24:52,871 --> 00:24:54,930
Caught him with the money,
but he said he didn't kill anybody.

276
00:24:55,007 --> 00:24:59,501
- Course. They all died off right.
- Then cut their own heads off?

277
00:25:25,938 --> 00:25:28,498
Put down your weapon!
Put it down!

278
00:25:30,209 --> 00:25:32,074
Call Jericho.

279
00:25:32,144 --> 00:25:33,975
Sergeant Jericho,
we need backup!

280
00:25:34,046 --> 00:25:36,037
We're 20 southwest
of the rec-fac.

281
00:25:36,114 --> 00:25:38,446
Don't open the door!
Don't let it out!

282
00:25:49,328 --> 00:25:51,091
Who goes there?

283
00:25:56,468 --> 00:25:58,663
I can't fight it!
It's in me!

284
00:26:05,377 --> 00:26:07,208
Commander Braddock!

285
00:26:22,561 --> 00:26:24,495
There's a man in there.
Open it.

286
00:26:27,733 --> 00:26:29,997
The lock is destroyed.
I gonna need a cutting torch.

287
00:26:30,068 --> 00:26:31,763
How long?

288
00:26:31,837 --> 00:26:33,964
At least half an hour,
maybe more.

289
00:26:35,407 --> 00:26:37,102
What the fuck
is going on here?

290
00:26:37,175 --> 00:26:39,268
He committed suicide.

291
00:26:39,344 --> 00:26:41,175
Before he slit his throat,
he yelled something...

292
00:26:41,246 --> 00:26:43,680
something like, "Stay away!

293
00:26:44,549 --> 00:26:48,610
Don't open the door.
Stay away."

294
00:26:50,122 --> 00:26:52,113
And now
the commander's gone.

295
00:27:04,369 --> 00:27:06,394
Maybe he was contagious.

296
00:27:07,739 --> 00:27:10,731
Or crazy.
I don't know.

297
00:27:10,809 --> 00:27:12,936
I say we take him at his word
and leave him locked in.

298
00:27:16,214 --> 00:27:19,980
Look, one of us has
to stay with the rookies.

299
00:27:20,052 --> 00:27:23,886
Why don't you go back to the jail?
I'll find the commander.

300
00:27:23,956 --> 00:27:26,686
Let's get the hell
out of this place.

301
00:27:26,792 --> 00:27:28,919
There's nothing we can do
for this guy.

302
00:27:30,796 --> 00:27:32,730
You're right.

303
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:34,766
Okay, let's go.

304
00:27:50,048 --> 00:27:52,744
Drop the weapon before
I cut this dyke bitch head off!.

305
00:27:52,818 --> 00:27:54,479
What the fuck happened?

306
00:27:54,553 --> 00:27:56,350
Bashira let him out
for some food.

307
00:27:56,421 --> 00:27:58,184
Let me guess.
You unshackled him.

308
00:28:00,993 --> 00:28:04,156
- What do you want, Williams?
- I wanna get the fuck out of here.

309
00:28:08,033 --> 00:28:10,092
We'll let you walk.
Just let the girl go.

310
00:28:10,168 --> 00:28:13,103
You think I'm falling for that shit?

311
00:28:13,171 --> 00:28:15,332
I can't let you take the rookie.

312
00:28:17,442 --> 00:28:20,707
Take me, okay?

313
00:28:26,451 --> 00:28:29,784
Put the gun down.
Put 'em down!

314
00:28:33,925 --> 00:28:35,392
Drop your gun, Descanso.

315
00:28:35,494 --> 00:28:37,462
Yeah, drop the gun, Descanso.

316
00:28:49,741 --> 00:28:52,972
Relax! Take it easy!

317
00:28:53,045 --> 00:28:55,309
Just relax, relax.

318
00:28:56,415 --> 00:28:59,816
- You'll get what you want.
- I know I'll get everything I want.

319
00:28:59,885 --> 00:29:01,318
Now let's go.

320
00:29:04,823 --> 00:29:08,088
Damn girl,
I like you already.

321
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:14,264
Shit.

322
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:20,164
You okay?

323
00:29:22,374 --> 00:29:24,342
Just swell.

324
00:29:25,644 --> 00:29:28,943
- Where's Williams?
- He took off out the air lock.

325
00:29:33,518 --> 00:29:35,145
He went into the clinic.

326
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,949
I saw him go in
not even two minutes ago.

327
00:29:37,022 --> 00:29:38,751
Let me guess.
He's got your shotgun, right?

328
00:29:38,857 --> 00:29:40,290
Couldn't help it.
He was too fast.

329
00:29:40,358 --> 00:29:42,223
He's still in there though.
I can see the back door from here.

330
00:29:42,294 --> 00:29:44,592
All right,
you two take the back door.

331
00:29:44,663 --> 00:29:48,565
I'll go in front and flush him out.
If he comes at you, shoot to kill.

332
00:31:33,872 --> 00:31:35,066
Now what?

333
00:31:45,417 --> 00:31:47,977
How the hell did that happen?

334
00:31:48,053 --> 00:31:50,715
- Let's go.
- Wait a minute.

335
00:31:51,423 --> 00:31:53,152
Looks like you're
coming with me now.

336
00:31:53,258 --> 00:31:57,058
You see what's going on out there.
You know I didn't kill nobody.

337
00:31:57,128 --> 00:32:00,894
- I said move it.
- I ain't going nowhere.

338
00:32:00,966 --> 00:32:03,594
I just saved your life.
You should let me go.

339
00:32:03,668 --> 00:32:06,193
And I saved yours.
Looks like we're even.

340
00:32:06,972 --> 00:32:09,532
Now move it!

341
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:40,304
Let me ask you something.

342
00:32:40,372 --> 00:32:44,103
If you're so innocent, how come we
found all that stolen flash on you?

343
00:32:45,243 --> 00:32:47,734
I didn't say I was innocent.

344
00:32:47,812 --> 00:32:49,871
I said I didn't kill nobody.

345
00:32:51,016 --> 00:32:53,610
Okay, let's say I believe you.

346
00:32:53,685 --> 00:32:56,347
What exactly happened
at K-305?

347
00:32:56,421 --> 00:32:58,321
I don't know.

348
00:32:58,423 --> 00:33:01,221
I was just changing trains
from Camp Sinai.

349
00:33:02,594 --> 00:33:05,722
Had a little time
to get me something to eat...

350
00:33:05,797 --> 00:33:07,992
so I went into the station.

351
00:33:46,838 --> 00:33:49,238
It was just lying there,
so you took it.

352
00:33:49,307 --> 00:33:51,434
You would have done
the same thing.

353
00:33:54,746 --> 00:33:57,943
See, that's where you're wrong.

354
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:00,985
I'm a cop, not a crook.

355
00:34:01,052 --> 00:34:06,012
It's a thin line between
a cop and a crook these days.

356
00:34:06,091 --> 00:34:08,150
You think it's a big difference
between you and me?

357
00:34:08,259 --> 00:34:11,251
You just got the woman
behind your bullshit.

358
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:15,825
Look at you.
You look high right now.

359
00:34:19,471 --> 00:34:22,372
You know
I saved your life out there.

360
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:25,739
So why don't you save mine
and let me out of here?

361
00:34:27,912 --> 00:34:29,345
Look...

362
00:34:30,982 --> 00:34:33,678
my job is to bring you back
to Chryse to stand trial.

363
00:34:34,686 --> 00:34:36,813
I don't think you did it.

364
00:34:36,888 --> 00:34:38,913
But that's not my call.

365
00:34:40,091 --> 00:34:42,559
So let's not make this any more
complicated than it has to be.

366
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:47,496
Yeah, it's gonna be
real complicated.

367
00:34:47,565 --> 00:34:49,362
You can believe that shit!

368
00:34:51,569 --> 00:34:54,094
I ain't going back!

369
00:34:54,773 --> 00:34:57,640
Soyou secured your prisoner.

370
00:34:57,709 --> 00:35:00,109
Where was your commanding
officer during this time?

371
00:35:00,178 --> 00:35:03,978
I can only report what
Sergeant Jericho told me later.

372
00:35:04,048 --> 00:35:05,811
After the man in the Rover
committed suicide...

373
00:35:05,884 --> 00:35:08,182
Jericho went looking
for the commander.

374
00:35:08,253 --> 00:35:10,312
Let's get the hell
out of this place.

375
00:35:10,388 --> 00:35:13,755
There's nothing we can do
for this guy.

376
00:35:13,858 --> 00:35:17,624
Yeah, you're right.
Let's go.

377
00:35:25,236 --> 00:35:27,170
Commander Braddock!

378
00:37:55,253 --> 00:37:58,381
Lieutenant,
we got a situation here.

379
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:02,125
Sergeant, you're breaking up.
I can hardly hear you.

380
00:38:02,927 --> 00:38:04,292
The commander's dead.

381
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:08,394
Everybody in the mine
has gone insane.

382
00:38:11,235 --> 00:38:13,203
Jericho, can you read?

383
00:38:21,479 --> 00:38:23,344
Hey, come on!
Let us out of here!

384
00:38:23,414 --> 00:38:25,405
Start at the beginning!

385
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:30,187
- I told you. I got here last night.
- Don't bullshit me!

386
00:38:30,254 --> 00:38:31,846
Lieutenant!

387
00:38:37,028 --> 00:38:39,462
What the hell is going on
out there?

388
00:38:42,867 --> 00:38:44,391
What?

389
00:38:46,337 --> 00:38:49,795
In semiarid regions on Earth,
there are certain organisms...

390
00:38:49,874 --> 00:38:52,900
that live in small pools
that are formed by the annual rains.

391
00:38:52,977 --> 00:38:55,571
When the pools dry up,
those organisms can't live.

392
00:38:55,647 --> 00:39:00,311
But they don't die either.
They go dormant below the surface...

393
00:39:00,385 --> 00:39:04,845
away from the hot sun
until the next rain cycle begins.

394
00:39:04,956 --> 00:39:07,186
Then they reemerge.

395
00:39:07,291 --> 00:39:09,054
I think something like that
is happening here.

396
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,025
I don't understand.

397
00:39:11,095 --> 00:39:13,996
Whatever used to live here,
we woke it up.

398
00:39:14,065 --> 00:39:16,465
It takes us, okay?

399
00:39:16,534 --> 00:39:19,332
I'm talking about
a kind of possession.

400
00:39:19,404 --> 00:39:21,804
Lieutenant, Sergeant Jericho
is on the radio.

401
00:39:21,873 --> 00:39:23,898
He said he found
three people out there.

402
00:39:23,975 --> 00:39:26,967
They're on their way in and
they got an ETA of five minutes.

403
00:39:27,045 --> 00:39:29,070
You should get on the radio
and talk to him.

404
00:39:29,147 --> 00:39:32,480
- He's found three people?
- That's what he said.

405
00:39:49,033 --> 00:39:51,194
- You okay?
- No.

406
00:39:51,269 --> 00:39:53,237
Something broken?

407
00:39:55,673 --> 00:39:58,642
I'm all right.

408
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:01,076
But it's out of the body now.

409
00:40:01,145 --> 00:40:03,477
Yeah, it's loose in here.

410
00:40:06,117 --> 00:40:08,176
Lieutenant,
sergeant's on the radio.

411
00:40:24,736 --> 00:40:27,864
Lieutenant, we're coming in.
Can you read me?

412
00:40:27,939 --> 00:40:31,875
- Sergeant, where are you?
- We're right down the street.

413
00:40:31,943 --> 00:40:33,911
We? Who's we?

414
00:40:33,978 --> 00:40:37,505
I found three people alive out here.
Come on. Open the door for us.

415
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:57,663
I tried to reach you on the radio.
Just you make sure that door is locked.

416
00:40:57,735 --> 00:40:59,362
There must be
200 of them fucking freaks...

417
00:40:59,437 --> 00:41:02,804
and any minute now
they'll be coming to kick our ass.

418
00:41:02,874 --> 00:41:07,470
Okay, relax.
Who are these guys?

419
00:41:07,545 --> 00:41:10,207
I found them hiding
up in the mine shed.

420
00:41:17,355 --> 00:41:21,223
Lieutenant,
we got a situation here.

421
00:41:21,325 --> 00:41:23,793
Sergeant, you're breaking up.
I can hardly hear you.

422
00:41:25,062 --> 00:41:27,326
The commander's dead.

423
00:41:28,466 --> 00:41:31,458
And everybody in the mine
has gone insane.

424
00:41:50,254 --> 00:41:52,188
Check the window!

425
00:42:02,633 --> 00:42:04,658
They didn't see him.
They're gone.

426
00:42:04,735 --> 00:42:08,432
- Who are you?
- Who are we? Who are you?

427
00:42:08,506 --> 00:42:12,806
- The man asked you a question.
- My name's Jericho.

428
00:42:12,877 --> 00:42:15,277
At least he's not one of them.

429
00:42:16,581 --> 00:42:21,018
What's happening out there?
Who the fuck are those clowns?

430
00:42:21,085 --> 00:42:22,985
What are they
all sparked up about?

431
00:42:23,054 --> 00:42:25,022
Used to be miners.

432
00:42:25,122 --> 00:42:27,522
Then everybody
in this place lost their mind.

433
00:42:27,592 --> 00:42:30,186
Running around,
chopping people's heads off.

434
00:42:32,029 --> 00:42:33,496
Ease up, man.

435
00:42:39,871 --> 00:42:42,772
We were up on the rim
when they called a work stoppage.

436
00:42:47,945 --> 00:42:50,846
- What are they doing?
- Shit, I don't know.

437
00:42:51,482 --> 00:42:54,576
Look at that. They're
knocking off early for the night.

438
00:42:54,652 --> 00:42:57,519
How will we sneak in on a shift change
if they knock off early for the night?

439
00:42:57,588 --> 00:43:00,352
Shut up!
What the hell is that?

440
00:43:05,796 --> 00:43:07,764
Let's get the hell out of here!

441
00:43:10,201 --> 00:43:12,863
We hid till the storm was over.

442
00:43:12,937 --> 00:43:16,202
Later, I went out
to take a look around.

443
00:43:16,274 --> 00:43:19,607
I thought they were all dead.

444
00:43:19,677 --> 00:43:23,238
Then some of them
started to come to.

445
00:43:23,314 --> 00:43:29,082
They walked around
like they were confused or lost.

446
00:43:29,153 --> 00:43:31,678
A few of them seemed okay.

447
00:43:31,756 --> 00:43:33,383
They was trying
to help the others.

448
00:43:34,492 --> 00:43:37,791
- Then they started changing.
- What do you mean?

449
00:43:38,896 --> 00:43:41,865
They act different,
stand different.

450
00:43:41,966 --> 00:43:45,299
Start cutting on themselves
for decoration.

451
00:43:45,369 --> 00:43:46,802
Filing their teeth.

452
00:43:48,072 --> 00:43:49,972
Making weapons.

453
00:43:52,176 --> 00:43:54,644
Killing the ones
who hadn't changed.

454
00:43:58,883 --> 00:44:03,786
Cutting people's faces off
and wearing them for masks.

455
00:44:12,563 --> 00:44:14,690
You lads got any weapons?

456
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,031
I mean real weapons.

457
00:44:18,102 --> 00:44:20,866
Only cops can have guns.

458
00:44:20,938 --> 00:44:23,168
There's some detonators
in them cases over there.

459
00:44:25,977 --> 00:44:28,343
Do you know
how these things work?

460
00:44:28,412 --> 00:44:31,074
I know you need dynamite
to use them.

461
00:44:31,148 --> 00:44:33,241
Okay, then.

462
00:44:33,317 --> 00:44:35,251
We take our prisoner
and we all get on the train.

463
00:44:35,319 --> 00:44:37,583
And what prisoner would that be?

464
00:44:37,655 --> 00:44:39,623
That doesn't concern you.

465
00:44:39,724 --> 00:44:41,555
If it's Desolation Williams...

466
00:44:43,194 --> 00:44:44,718
it concerns me very much.

467
00:44:44,829 --> 00:44:46,421
Now drop your weapon.

468
00:44:52,737 --> 00:44:56,104
All of you!
Weapons on the floor.

469
00:45:05,016 --> 00:45:08,952
So only cops have guns, eh?
You fucking pricks.

470
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:12,456
We lied.
Now go get Williams.

471
00:45:13,958 --> 00:45:15,892
I don't think so.

472
00:45:17,495 --> 00:45:19,861
What was that?

473
00:45:19,930 --> 00:45:22,763
- Fucking kill me.
- No problem.

474
00:45:22,833 --> 00:45:25,996
Look, will you two
stop fucking about?

475
00:45:30,041 --> 00:45:32,509
Lieutenant, let Williams out.

476
00:45:32,576 --> 00:45:34,066
Give me one good reason.

477
00:45:34,812 --> 00:45:37,144
I just gave you
about 200 good reasons...

478
00:45:37,214 --> 00:45:39,478
and they're probably outside
right now.

479
00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:41,484
It doesn't matter that Williams
is wanted for murder...

480
00:45:41,552 --> 00:45:44,180
and it doesn't matter
that this lot are scumbags.

481
00:45:44,255 --> 00:45:48,487
What matters right now is that
we stick together to get out of here.

482
00:45:48,592 --> 00:45:49,820
All of us...

483
00:45:49,927 --> 00:45:54,057
including Williams,
including them.

484
00:45:54,865 --> 00:45:58,596
Who are you calling scumbag,
motherfucker?

485
00:45:59,837 --> 00:46:03,364
Now quit with all your fucking
stalling and take us to Williams!

486
00:46:06,444 --> 00:46:09,038
I'll be goddamn.

487
00:46:11,615 --> 00:46:12,775
Finally.

488
00:46:12,850 --> 00:46:15,910
Man, this town done went crazy.

489
00:46:15,986 --> 00:46:18,648
We had to improvise.
You like it?

490
00:46:18,756 --> 00:46:20,223
I love it.

491
00:46:20,291 --> 00:46:22,225
I want you to let him out.

492
00:46:28,732 --> 00:46:31,064
What's up, D?

493
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:34,999
I'm still shackled.

494
00:46:35,072 --> 00:46:37,632
What, are you pigs on a fucking break?
Free him up.

495
00:46:42,379 --> 00:46:45,143
I knew you'd let me go.

496
00:46:48,452 --> 00:46:52,013
- It's been a long time.
- I didn't think y'all could do it.

497
00:46:52,123 --> 00:46:53,590
Piece of cake.

498
00:46:53,691 --> 00:46:55,955
It was my plan, Desolation.

499
00:46:57,561 --> 00:46:59,028
Fuck!

500
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:01,690
- I thought you was watching the door.
- I was!

501
00:47:01,765 --> 00:47:04,598
- Bitch, you better open this door.
- I don't think so.

502
00:47:04,668 --> 00:47:08,399
You don't open that door,
I'm gonna blow your head off.

503
00:47:08,472 --> 00:47:11,168
Then your asses will never get out.

504
00:47:11,242 --> 00:47:12,800
Someone will find you sometime...

505
00:47:12,877 --> 00:47:15,903
probably tied upside down in here
with your heads cut off.

506
00:47:17,014 --> 00:47:19,505
Tell your dogs to quit barking
so we can talk.

507
00:47:22,586 --> 00:47:24,679
Put 'em down.

508
00:47:27,057 --> 00:47:28,991
Put it down.

509
00:47:30,694 --> 00:47:33,060
Listen to me, Williams.

510
00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:35,530
We don't have a lot of time.

511
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:38,796
You need us and we need you.

512
00:47:38,869 --> 00:47:40,598
We've all seen
what's going on out there...

513
00:47:40,671 --> 00:47:43,538
and none of us is gonna survive
if we don't stick together.

514
00:47:43,607 --> 00:47:46,075
I need you to give me
your word...

515
00:47:46,143 --> 00:47:48,043
that if I open this door...

516
00:47:48,112 --> 00:47:51,604
you and your boys will stand by
my command at all times.

517
00:47:53,551 --> 00:47:55,485
I never give my word.

518
00:47:55,553 --> 00:47:58,021
It's okay.

519
00:47:58,088 --> 00:48:00,079
I never make deals
with criminals either.

520
00:48:04,328 --> 00:48:06,660
- You got it.
- What?

521
00:48:08,132 --> 00:48:09,724
You making deals with cops?

522
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:13,133
And you are too.
Give her your weapon.

523
00:48:14,572 --> 00:48:16,506
Everybody, give it up.

524
00:48:31,555 --> 00:48:33,853
Well, introduce us
to your friends.

525
00:48:33,958 --> 00:48:36,426
These my compadres.

526
00:48:41,865 --> 00:48:43,799
Uno must be the nice one.

527
00:48:45,236 --> 00:48:47,830
You got that right, Butchy.

528
00:48:47,905 --> 00:48:49,873
I'm not as nice as Desolation.

529
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:52,773
And I'll cut
your fucking titties off.

530
00:48:52,843 --> 00:48:55,471
Who's in charge here?

531
00:48:55,546 --> 00:48:56,979
You better let go of my arm.

532
00:48:57,047 --> 00:48:58,537
Who is in charge here?

533
00:48:58,616 --> 00:49:00,709
You! You!

534
00:49:04,054 --> 00:49:04,986
Shit!

535
00:49:12,463 --> 00:49:15,159
So, you just gonna stand there
and watch her break my shit.

536
00:49:15,232 --> 00:49:16,392
Yeah.

537
00:49:16,467 --> 00:49:20,233
And now that you're done mopping
the floor, get me a beer, killer.

538
00:49:20,304 --> 00:49:21,532
What's next?

539
00:49:22,339 --> 00:49:23,897
We get more deputies.

540
00:49:27,578 --> 00:49:29,842
You're deputized.

541
00:49:29,913 --> 00:49:31,972
Consider this
a martial law situation.

542
00:49:32,816 --> 00:49:34,249
Let's go.

543
00:49:41,625 --> 00:49:43,388
When did this start?

544
00:49:44,862 --> 00:49:47,831
It started a few minutes ago.

545
00:49:47,931 --> 00:49:51,423
- What should we do with him?
- We can't take him with us.

546
00:49:51,502 --> 00:49:53,697
Then here he stays.

547
00:50:26,870 --> 00:50:29,395
Guys, what is that?

548
00:50:29,473 --> 00:50:30,462
It's a Laffer.

549
00:50:30,541 --> 00:50:33,066
A black-market breather.

550
00:50:33,143 --> 00:50:35,577
It has a 15 percent
nitrous mix.

551
00:50:35,646 --> 00:50:38,080
It gets you high?

552
00:50:38,148 --> 00:50:40,446
It turns your brain
into Swiss cheese.

553
00:50:46,156 --> 00:50:49,216
- One gross of detonators.
- What are those good for?

554
00:50:49,326 --> 00:50:51,851
It would help
if we had some dynamite...

555
00:50:51,962 --> 00:50:53,896
but they make
a pretty good bang.

556
00:50:53,964 --> 00:50:57,764
We could put them in some food cans
or something, make some hand grenades.

557
00:50:57,835 --> 00:51:00,303
All right.
You got ten minutes.

558
00:51:05,509 --> 00:51:07,875
Easy.

559
00:51:07,945 --> 00:51:09,879
Here. Let me do it.

560
00:51:33,570 --> 00:51:35,435
That's beautiful.

561
00:51:37,408 --> 00:51:39,137
That's what you get, dumb-ass.

562
00:51:42,946 --> 00:51:44,880
You're gonna be okay
to do this?

563
00:51:52,756 --> 00:51:55,224
All right,
it's almost 2200 hours.

564
00:51:55,325 --> 00:51:57,259
Here's the plan,
short and simple.

565
00:51:57,361 --> 00:52:00,524
Descanso and Jericho take the lead.
Everybody else follows.

566
00:52:00,597 --> 00:52:02,758
It's about 50 meters
from here to the station.

567
00:52:02,833 --> 00:52:04,391
Bashira and I are in the rear.

568
00:52:04,468 --> 00:52:06,333
Any questions?

569
00:52:11,241 --> 00:52:13,175
Put your hand down.

570
00:52:25,622 --> 00:52:27,783
All clear.

571
00:52:27,891 --> 00:52:29,825
Let's do it!

572
00:52:43,874 --> 00:52:46,672
Hey, bro, I don't see
no motherfucking train.

573
00:52:47,744 --> 00:52:48,904
Hey, lady.

574
00:52:48,979 --> 00:52:50,606
We don't see no train.

575
00:52:53,183 --> 00:52:54,115
It'll be here.

576
00:52:55,219 --> 00:52:56,777
Come on. Let's go.

577
00:53:07,064 --> 00:53:08,031
That's the mine office.

578
00:53:13,070 --> 00:53:14,560
What are they doing?

579
00:53:14,638 --> 00:53:17,471
Looks like they're tearing the whole
town apart, building by building.

580
00:53:23,514 --> 00:53:25,277
Come on. Pick it up.

581
00:53:30,454 --> 00:53:31,887
Lieutenant.

582
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:36,158
Hold your fire.
Just keep on moving.

583
00:53:40,898 --> 00:53:42,559
Go!

584
00:53:54,311 --> 00:53:56,245
- Where's the train?
- I don't know.

585
00:53:56,313 --> 00:53:58,474
You don't know? What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

586
00:53:58,549 --> 00:54:00,483
Lieutenant Ballard to the train,
come in.

587
00:54:00,551 --> 00:54:03,315
Plan A is fucked up.
You got a plan B?

588
00:54:03,387 --> 00:54:05,719
Yeah. It's the same as plan A.

589
00:54:05,822 --> 00:54:08,518
You got any fresh ideas?

590
00:54:08,625 --> 00:54:10,752
Yeah. What we should have done
in the first place.

591
00:54:12,429 --> 00:54:13,794
Shit!

592
00:54:14,064 --> 00:54:16,032
Come on,
you mindless motherfuckers!

593
00:54:57,274 --> 00:55:00,038
- Second time I saved your life.
- Run a tab.

594
00:55:31,608 --> 00:55:33,542
Jericho, grenade!

595
00:56:19,990 --> 00:56:21,924
Come on, man. On your feet.
Let's move.

596
00:56:24,995 --> 00:56:25,927
Shit.

597
00:57:01,231 --> 00:57:02,163
Open that door.

598
00:57:15,679 --> 00:57:19,809
We sealed the air lock doors, and
Sergeant Jericho dismantled the lock.

599
00:57:20,717 --> 00:57:24,244
They couldn't open the door
from the outside, so we were safe...

600
00:57:24,321 --> 00:57:25,754
for a while.

601
00:57:27,958 --> 00:57:29,892
Get on the radio.
Try to reach the train.

602
00:57:32,863 --> 00:57:34,296
Where's your brother?

603
00:57:37,467 --> 00:57:40,061
- He didn't make it.
- Oh, God.

604
00:57:51,114 --> 00:57:53,048
Uno was your brother?

605
00:57:54,551 --> 00:57:55,711
Yeah.

606
00:58:35,792 --> 00:58:37,350
Look at him.

607
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:40,520
Whatever is inside of him
has waited a long time to get out.

608
00:58:41,364 --> 00:58:44,663
I didn't understand their design,
how they move.

609
00:58:44,734 --> 00:58:46,258
But it's got to be the wind.

610
00:58:46,336 --> 00:58:48,133
Yeah.

611
00:58:48,205 --> 00:58:49,763
Yeah, the wind takes them.

612
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:51,671
And then once their hosts die...

613
00:58:51,741 --> 00:58:55,768
they drift along the railroad tracks
from town to town, human to human.

614
00:58:56,780 --> 00:58:59,408
What a perfect creation.

615
00:58:59,482 --> 00:59:02,576
Vengeance on anything or anyone that
tries to lay claim to their planet.

616
00:59:08,425 --> 00:59:10,552
What did you see
at Drucker's Ridge?

617
00:59:16,466 --> 00:59:19,401
I was at the mine when
they called a work stoppage.

618
00:59:20,537 --> 00:59:24,234
It was a Section 740,
a "scientifically significant find."

619
00:59:38,154 --> 00:59:41,681
A 740 applies to any number
of things found on Mars.

620
00:59:41,791 --> 00:59:45,727
A biological organism, an indication
of water, things like that.

621
00:59:50,233 --> 00:59:53,999
After we dynamited the mountain,
we discovered an entrance.

622
00:59:54,070 --> 00:59:57,437
It was a tunnel
carved into the rock.

623
00:59:57,507 --> 01:00:00,374
it had been hidden underneath
the outer walls for centuries...

624
01:00:00,443 --> 01:00:03,879
and someone other than man
had carved it.

625
01:00:55,165 --> 01:00:56,826
Jesus!

626
01:00:59,569 --> 01:01:02,470
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know.

627
01:01:13,450 --> 01:01:15,384
Let's get the hell
out of here!

628
01:01:30,533 --> 01:01:32,899
It was me.

629
01:01:32,969 --> 01:01:35,961
I opened Pandora's box.
I let them out.

630
01:01:36,573 --> 01:01:38,165
I contacted the train.

631
01:01:38,241 --> 01:01:40,835
They're about three kliks north of town
on a decoupling spur.

632
01:01:40,910 --> 01:01:42,969
- They said the tracks are blocked.
- Can they get through?

633
01:01:43,046 --> 01:01:45,207
Yeah, they're working on it.

634
01:01:51,254 --> 01:01:53,154
- You okay?
- Yes.

635
01:01:53,223 --> 01:01:55,691
- Barricaded the rear door.
- Good.

636
01:01:55,759 --> 01:01:58,785
There's a maintenance courtyard out
the back enclosed by a five-meter wall.

637
01:01:58,895 --> 01:02:01,329
There's even
a Rover parked out there.

638
01:02:01,398 --> 01:02:03,923
Maybe we can make
a run for it.

639
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,093
No, we wait.

640
01:02:06,169 --> 01:02:08,729
Bashira got in touch with the train.
They're coming back for us.

641
01:02:21,718 --> 01:02:24,778
Well, if a train comin',
they better hurry up.

642
01:02:34,898 --> 01:02:37,264
What's the matter with you?
You did good out there.

643
01:02:38,601 --> 01:02:40,626
Yeah, right.

644
01:02:41,304 --> 01:02:43,397
It's a fucked-up situation.

645
01:02:44,808 --> 01:02:47,333
I never put too much faith in cops,
but you did all right.

646
01:02:51,614 --> 01:02:52,808
You trust me?

647
01:02:52,882 --> 01:02:54,679
Hell, no.

648
01:02:54,751 --> 01:02:57,720
I really don't understand you
at all, Desolation.

649
01:02:58,488 --> 01:03:00,649
The only one looking out
for me is me.

650
01:03:00,757 --> 01:03:02,281
Doesn't that bother you?

651
01:03:02,392 --> 01:03:04,360
Nothing bothers me.

652
01:03:06,729 --> 01:03:08,959
I stopped worrying
a long time ago.

653
01:03:09,032 --> 01:03:11,193
Don't you believe in anything?

654
01:03:14,704 --> 01:03:16,797
I believe in staying alive.

655
01:03:16,873 --> 01:03:18,898
Yeah, but for what?

656
01:03:20,343 --> 01:03:22,971
Stick around.
I might let you know one day.

657
01:03:24,647 --> 01:03:25,579
When?

658
01:03:26,549 --> 01:03:29,643
When the tide is high
and the water's rising.

659
01:03:42,932 --> 01:03:44,695
Doing okay in here?

660
01:03:49,672 --> 01:03:50,934
Check this out.

661
01:04:03,953 --> 01:04:07,150
- What about it?
- It's pretty solid.

662
01:04:07,257 --> 01:04:10,624
One way in and a back door out,
leading to the rear entrance.

663
01:04:16,466 --> 01:04:20,197
- A good sturdy door.
- So what's your point?

664
01:04:20,270 --> 01:04:23,933
It's rather cozy,
don't you think?

665
01:04:26,743 --> 01:04:29,371
I don't believe this.

666
01:04:29,445 --> 01:04:31,379
You lured me back here
to seduce me?

667
01:04:31,447 --> 01:04:35,110
Yeah, well, the way
things are going...

668
01:04:35,185 --> 01:04:38,177
I thought this might be
our last chance to--

669
01:04:38,254 --> 01:04:39,448
to dance.

670
01:04:42,926 --> 01:04:44,325
Yeah.

671
01:04:57,674 --> 01:05:00,165
Fuck him,
whatever the fuck he is.

672
01:05:09,385 --> 01:05:11,319
It's out of him.

673
01:05:13,423 --> 01:05:14,913
Everyone go! Get out!

674
01:05:17,994 --> 01:05:20,224
Let's take her out back.

675
01:05:20,296 --> 01:05:22,491
What the fuck do you mean?

676
01:05:22,565 --> 01:05:24,089
We aren't moving her anywhere.

677
01:05:24,167 --> 01:05:27,967
It's taking her over, man.
There's nothing we can do.

678
01:05:28,037 --> 01:05:29,504
Easy, man.

679
01:05:29,572 --> 01:05:32,632
I lost a brother in this.
That's not her.

680
01:05:36,579 --> 01:05:38,012
Come on.

681
01:05:48,057 --> 01:05:50,025
Let's put her down
before they hear us.

682
01:05:56,899 --> 01:05:58,833
This belongs to her.

683
01:05:59,902 --> 01:06:02,302
- Where did you get it?
- I stole it.

684
01:06:03,139 --> 01:06:05,403
Do you know what it is?

685
01:06:05,475 --> 01:06:06,806
It's her stash.

686
01:06:07,744 --> 01:06:10,372
This will mess
with anything in there.

687
01:06:14,350 --> 01:06:16,215
Bon voyage, Mel.

688
01:06:16,286 --> 01:06:18,220
Let's get the hell back in here.

689
01:07:39,569 --> 01:07:41,503
I will not.

690
01:07:56,552 --> 01:07:58,486
I was aware of having...

691
01:07:59,922 --> 01:08:01,355
thoughts...

692
01:08:02,959 --> 01:08:04,290
or memories.

693
01:08:04,827 --> 01:08:07,591
Like I'd been invaded
by something...

694
01:08:07,663 --> 01:08:10,496
and it was trying
to take me over.

695
01:08:10,566 --> 01:08:14,127
Something inside of me wouldn't let that
other thing take over and I fought it.

696
01:08:14,203 --> 01:08:17,434
I didn't know where I was at first,
and then it hit me.

697
01:08:17,507 --> 01:08:18,997
I was outside alone...

698
01:08:20,543 --> 01:08:21,976
unarmed.

699
01:09:48,297 --> 01:09:50,231
The back wall's been breached.

700
01:09:55,671 --> 01:09:57,605
Don't worry.
The back door's locked and secured.

701
01:09:59,141 --> 01:10:01,507
Let me in.

702
01:10:01,577 --> 01:10:03,909
It's me.

703
01:10:03,980 --> 01:10:06,107
Shit! It's Melanie!
Open the door!

704
01:10:06,182 --> 01:10:08,446
Looks like her to me.

705
01:10:08,518 --> 01:10:10,486
I haven't heard any of
these things speaking English.

706
01:10:11,954 --> 01:10:14,081
Come on, Williams. The tide's
getting high out here.

707
01:10:14,190 --> 01:10:16,283
Give me those keys.

708
01:10:16,392 --> 01:10:17,620
Come on!

709
01:10:22,398 --> 01:10:23,922
Is it you?

710
01:10:25,167 --> 01:10:26,600
Yes.

711
01:10:28,037 --> 01:10:29,470
It's me.

712
01:10:37,113 --> 01:10:38,637
I had a glimpse
of the Martians...

713
01:10:40,182 --> 01:10:42,980
of their minds,
of what they want.

714
01:10:43,052 --> 01:10:46,852
They won't rest short of the
destruction of any invading species.

715
01:10:48,190 --> 01:10:50,715
As far as they're concerned,
we are the invaders.

716
01:10:53,195 --> 01:10:55,129
Something's kicking out there.

717
01:11:03,372 --> 01:11:05,340
Shit. They made
a battering ram.

718
01:11:05,408 --> 01:11:07,876
Everybody to the rear
of the jail.

719
01:11:07,944 --> 01:11:09,878
Bashira, you and Jericho
go back to the storeroom.

720
01:11:09,946 --> 01:11:12,210
Load up on detonators.
You're the second line of defense.

721
01:11:12,281 --> 01:11:13,213
We stay here?

722
01:11:14,016 --> 01:11:16,814
We hold them off as long as we can,
then we fall back to the storeroom.

723
01:11:16,886 --> 01:11:20,822
Soon as we kill one of them, whatever
is inside is gonna come after us.

724
01:11:22,124 --> 01:11:23,182
I know.

725
01:11:23,292 --> 01:11:25,192
So if one of us gets possessed--

726
01:11:25,761 --> 01:11:26,693
Leave 'em.

727
01:12:07,336 --> 01:12:10,100
Here we go. Party time.

728
01:12:44,373 --> 01:12:45,772
- I'm out.
- I'm out.

729
01:12:52,481 --> 01:12:54,642
- Clear!
- Move! Move!

730
01:13:02,858 --> 01:13:03,950
Clear!

731
01:13:14,136 --> 01:13:15,763
- Clear! Clear!
- Stand clear!

732
01:13:23,479 --> 01:13:25,174
- Clear!
- Get out!

733
01:13:38,994 --> 01:13:40,962
- I got it.
- Take them out back.

734
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:45,531
Get out of here.

735
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:39,187
Come on!

736
01:14:39,255 --> 01:14:41,189
Come on! Let's go!

737
01:15:02,077 --> 01:15:04,045
Look for the train. See if you
can get someone on the radio.

738
01:15:04,113 --> 01:15:07,048
Jericho, get this thing started.
Whitlock, unlock the gate.

739
01:15:15,357 --> 01:15:17,291
Come on! Hurry up!

740
01:15:20,696 --> 01:15:22,391
The train's at the station.

741
01:15:23,332 --> 01:15:26,358
- Officer to train, do you read?
- Where the hell have you been?

742
01:15:26,435 --> 01:15:29,598
- Where the hell have you been?
- All right, Bashira, come down.

743
01:15:29,672 --> 01:15:32,197
All right, wait for us.
We're on our way.

744
01:15:33,642 --> 01:15:35,075
Let's go.

745
01:15:40,683 --> 01:15:41,615
Get in!

746
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:26,318
Get yourselves ready.

747
01:16:27,096 --> 01:16:28,028
Oh, my.

748
01:16:34,403 --> 01:16:36,837
Come on!

749
01:16:36,906 --> 01:16:39,397
Come on! Let's go!
Let's go! Come on!

750
01:16:40,476 --> 01:16:42,637
Come on!

751
01:16:42,711 --> 01:16:44,645
Okay, go! Go!

752
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:52,719
What the hell happened to you?

753
01:16:52,788 --> 01:16:55,052
We got trapped a couple of kliks
north of here, trying to off-load.

754
01:16:55,157 --> 01:16:56,454
I'll get us out of here.

755
01:17:11,106 --> 01:17:13,540
We've got to go back.

756
01:17:13,609 --> 01:17:16,635
Slow the train down outside of town,
then come to a complete stop.

757
01:17:18,747 --> 01:17:20,180
No way.

758
01:17:21,383 --> 01:17:25,251
- I'm giving you an order.
- I don't care. The answer's no.

759
01:17:28,524 --> 01:17:30,424
The answer's yes.

760
01:17:31,927 --> 01:17:33,758
Look...

761
01:17:33,829 --> 01:17:39,267
even if we get back to Chryse,
those things will just keep coming.

762
01:17:39,335 --> 01:17:41,269
We've got a chance here.

763
01:17:42,771 --> 01:17:45,569
We've got a chance to stop this thing
before it goes any further.

764
01:17:46,175 --> 01:17:48,735
This is about one thing--

765
01:17:48,811 --> 01:17:50,244
dominion.

766
01:17:51,613 --> 01:17:53,604
It's not their planet anymore.

767
01:17:54,516 --> 01:17:56,108
What about him?

768
01:17:56,185 --> 01:17:58,710
Isn't it our job
to take him back?

769
01:18:01,123 --> 01:18:03,683
Is he still a prisoner
or is he one of us?

770
01:18:05,427 --> 01:18:08,157
I can give a damn
about saving this planet.

771
01:18:09,264 --> 01:18:12,461
Seems like it's been after me
since the day I was born.

772
01:18:14,336 --> 01:18:17,134
If I'm gonna die,
I'm gonna die fighting...

773
01:18:17,206 --> 01:18:19,037
not running.

774
01:18:32,855 --> 01:18:35,983
If we blew up the nuclear
power station, what would happen?

775
01:18:36,091 --> 01:18:38,150
I mean, there'd be
a huge explosion, right?

776
01:18:38,260 --> 01:18:41,491
No, not unless you retract
the control rods and expose the core.

777
01:18:41,563 --> 01:18:42,996
Then what?

778
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:47,936
Then you'd have a small
atomic bomb going "boom."

779
01:18:50,039 --> 01:18:50,971
How small?

780
01:18:52,708 --> 01:18:55,973
I don't know. It'd blow out
a radius of a mile, maybe two.

781
01:19:00,516 --> 01:19:01,915
Would it kill them?

782
01:19:01,984 --> 01:19:04,452
It would certainly destroy
their human hosts, but as for them...

783
01:19:05,754 --> 01:19:06,914
I don't know.

784
01:19:10,793 --> 01:19:13,023
Jericho, can you get us in?

785
01:19:14,763 --> 01:19:16,196
I can try.

786
01:19:32,247 --> 01:19:34,112
The plan was simple.

787
01:19:34,183 --> 01:19:37,016
Sergeant Jericho, the science officer
and I jumped off the train...

788
01:19:37,086 --> 01:19:39,316
and headed towards
the powerplant.

789
01:19:39,388 --> 01:19:43,051
The others stayed aboard the train
as it backed into the station.

790
01:19:43,158 --> 01:19:45,058
The idea was they provide cover...

791
01:19:45,127 --> 01:19:48,824
and distract the Martians
as we set the charges in the plant.

792
01:19:48,897 --> 01:19:51,024
And they'd swing back, pick us up
and we'd all get as far away...

793
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:53,330
from Shining Canyon as we could
before the place blew.

794
01:19:53,402 --> 01:19:55,870
Like I said,
it was a simple plan.

795
01:19:56,939 --> 01:19:59,567
The only problem was, it didn't work
the way it was supposed to.

796
01:20:07,583 --> 01:20:10,143
- How are you doing,Jericho?
- I'm working on it.

797
01:20:10,219 --> 01:20:11,379
Hurry up.

798
01:20:26,668 --> 01:20:30,434
We've got to remove the waterjacket
and destroy the containment shell.

799
01:20:30,506 --> 01:20:32,030
Where do I put the dynamite?

800
01:20:48,257 --> 01:20:52,057
Officer to the train, they've
spotted us. Get your ass back here now.

801
01:21:56,391 --> 01:21:57,415
Yeah?

802
01:22:39,134 --> 01:22:40,567
Let's go.

803
01:23:27,949 --> 01:23:29,382
We've got to get out
of here fast.

804
01:23:29,451 --> 01:23:32,011
The Doc says the blast radius
could be up to two miles.

805
01:23:32,087 --> 01:23:34,351
- What does that mean?
- It means step on it.

806
01:23:56,011 --> 01:23:57,945
Stay here and keep it
full throttle.

807
01:23:58,013 --> 01:23:59,378
What are you gonna do?

808
01:23:59,448 --> 01:24:01,211
Lighten our load.

809
01:24:03,952 --> 01:24:06,443
I think there's some
more dynamite in the rear car.

810
01:26:30,699 --> 01:26:32,963
See you later,
you big motherfucker.

811
01:27:03,498 --> 01:27:04,658
You okay?

812
01:27:05,467 --> 01:27:06,399
Say your prayers.

813
01:27:41,603 --> 01:27:44,436
I didn't know
you was cut this deep.

814
01:27:45,607 --> 01:27:48,804
Should've taken care
of this hours ago.

815
01:27:49,477 --> 01:27:51,945
You do that like a pro.

816
01:27:52,013 --> 01:27:53,378
Yeah.

817
01:27:53,448 --> 01:27:55,939
Me and my brother
been through a lot of battles...

818
01:27:57,218 --> 01:27:59,243
ever since we was kids.

819
01:28:02,657 --> 01:28:05,490
I never thought I'd go to war
with somebody like you.

820
01:28:06,928 --> 01:28:10,625
I know when you get to Chryse, you'll
tell those people that I helped you...

821
01:28:11,700 --> 01:28:14,396
and I wasn't the cause
of all this mess around here.

822
01:28:15,570 --> 01:28:18,630
'Cause I know they're looking
for somebody to blame.

823
01:28:18,707 --> 01:28:21,232
I swear to you, Williams...

824
01:28:21,309 --> 01:28:25,302
as soon as I get back, I'm gonna tell my
superiors about this fucked-up planet.

825
01:28:26,448 --> 01:28:29,178
They'll drop the charges
as soon as they get the report.

826
01:28:36,558 --> 01:28:38,526
That ought to hold it.

827
01:28:38,627 --> 01:28:40,720
When you get there,
have somebody look at it.

828
01:28:41,830 --> 01:28:45,357
I couldn't get it perfect,
so it might leave a scar.

829
01:28:45,433 --> 01:28:46,764
I'm getting a collection.

830
01:28:46,835 --> 01:28:48,928
You'll be all right.

831
01:28:52,374 --> 01:28:54,308
- Comfortable?
- Yeah.

832
01:28:55,944 --> 01:28:57,878
I'll get you a blanket.

833
01:29:09,057 --> 01:29:11,082
What the hell are you doing?

834
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:13,694
Oh, this is where I get off.

835
01:29:13,762 --> 01:29:15,923
What are you talking about?

836
01:29:15,997 --> 01:29:19,933
We'll be in Chryse soon.
Can't let you turn me in.

837
01:29:21,903 --> 01:29:23,837
I can't let you walk.

838
01:29:28,476 --> 01:29:31,309
What you gonna do,
fucking shoot me?

839
01:29:39,621 --> 01:29:40,986
There's nowhere to run.

840
01:29:44,359 --> 01:29:46,452
Anywhere is better than hell.

841
01:29:49,497 --> 01:29:51,431
Catch you later.

842
01:29:54,836 --> 01:29:56,770
Yeah, right.

843
01:30:04,012 --> 01:30:05,445
Shit.

844
01:30:13,154 --> 01:30:15,452
And what happened to Williams?

845
01:30:15,557 --> 01:30:17,024
I don't know.

846
01:30:17,092 --> 01:30:18,992
When I woke up, he was gone.

847
01:30:19,060 --> 01:30:20,357
And you were handcuffed?

848
01:30:21,529 --> 01:30:23,463
Must've done it
while I slept.

849
01:30:24,532 --> 01:30:26,466
At that point,
I trusted him.

850
01:30:28,436 --> 01:30:30,495
That's all you have to tell us?

851
01:30:31,339 --> 01:30:33,273
That's all I know.

852
01:30:34,542 --> 01:30:38,137
All right, Lieutenant Ballard,
I suggest you get some rest.

853
01:30:38,213 --> 01:30:40,147
You're dismissed.

854
01:30:52,994 --> 01:30:57,658
Is our statement to the Cartel going to
be that Mars is being overrun by ghosts?

855
01:31:22,991 --> 01:31:24,959
Attention, all police personnel...

856
01:31:25,059 --> 01:31:27,391
report to your nearest
munitions station immediately...

857
01:31:27,462 --> 01:31:29,191
for weaponry assignment.

858
01:31:29,264 --> 01:31:32,290
A security breach has occurred
in the south quadrant.

859
01:31:32,367 --> 01:31:35,393
This is a level-ten emergency.

860
01:31:35,470 --> 01:31:40,237
All police personnel, report to your
division sergeant for assignment.

861
01:31:40,308 --> 01:31:43,766
All civilian personnel,
evacuate the streets immediately.

862
01:31:43,845 --> 01:31:46,609
Please remain indoors
until further instructed.

863
01:32:00,662 --> 01:32:01,594
Come on.

864
01:32:03,631 --> 01:32:06,828
Tide is up.
Time to stay alive.

865
01:32:18,546 --> 01:32:22,505
If you ever wanna come to the other
side, you'd make a hell of a crook.

866
01:32:22,584 --> 01:32:24,518
You'd make a hell of a cop.

867
01:32:27,188 --> 01:32:28,712
Let's just kick some ass.

868
01:32:29,712 --> 01:32:39,712
