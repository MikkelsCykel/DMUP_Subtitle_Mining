00:02:38,594 --> 00:02:40,353
Lucy, calm down.

2
00:02:40,929 --> 00:02:42,950
Lucy, calm down.

3
00:02:43,618 --> 00:02:46,164
I... I see something horrible happening.

4
00:02:50,495 --> 00:02:53,269
You're just having another nightmare.

5
00:02:57,331 --> 00:02:58,347
I'm scared.

6
00:02:58,413 --> 00:03:00,478
Relax... It's only a bad dream.

7
00:05:04,784 --> 00:05:09,320
Jonathan. You're working too hard.
It's not good for you.

8
00:05:09,996 --> 00:05:11,537
I'm worried about you.

9
00:06:02,287 --> 00:06:03,597
Good morning.

10
00:06:07,356 --> 00:06:10,740
Ah, Harker, please come up here.

11
00:06:17,745 --> 00:06:19,200
Yes, Mr. Renfield.

12
00:06:23,159 --> 00:06:25,151
I have a very important job for you.

13
00:06:27,118 --> 00:06:30,357
And I don't trust anyone else
to do it, but you.

14
00:06:31,101 --> 00:06:33,199
You're very kind, Mr. Renfield.

15
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:36,108
Count Dracula...

16
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,339
...he sent me a letter from Transylvania.

17
00:06:40,745 --> 00:06:43,418
He wants to buy a house around here.

18
00:06:44,772 --> 00:06:48,325
I'm aware that it's a long trip to
go there.

19
00:06:48,763 --> 00:06:50,132
Where is that?

20
00:06:51,437 --> 00:06:53,713
Somewhere over the
Carpathian mountains, isn't it?

21
00:06:53,841 --> 00:06:54,880
Yes...

22
00:06:56,166 --> 00:07:00,226
...and there will be a large commission.

23
00:07:00,869 --> 00:07:03,610
Oh, then I could get
a larger house for Lucy.

24
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,809
She deserves a nicer house.

25
00:07:08,211 --> 00:07:11,258
Well, this won't be easy.

26
00:07:12,002 --> 00:07:14,092
It'll take you a long time...

27
00:07:14,922 --> 00:07:18,069
...you'll sweat a lot...

28
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:20,994
...and perhaps you'll also...

29
00:07:22,652 --> 00:07:24,275
...spill some blood.

30
00:07:32,769 --> 00:07:35,645
It'll be good for me
to get out of the city...

31
00:07:39,296 --> 00:07:41,220
...get away from these canals...

32
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:44,637
...which go nowhere.

33
00:07:45,652 --> 00:07:47,243
Transylvania...

34
00:07:47,818 --> 00:07:51,032
...there it is, beyond the forest.

35
00:07:52,385 --> 00:07:54,246
It's a wonderful place.

36
00:07:55,397 --> 00:07:57,834
A little gloomy, maybe, but very exciting.

37
00:08:00,812 --> 00:08:03,541
The Count is looking
for a beautiful old house.

38
00:08:04,055 --> 00:08:07,204
I'm going to show him the big house,
near your place.

39
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:11,122
But it's been abandoned for years.
It looks like a haunted house.

40
00:08:11,765 --> 00:08:14,946
I'm sure he'll feel
very comfortable there.

41
00:08:16,232 --> 00:08:20,225
Anyway, we'll offer it to him.
I'd like you to leave soon.

42
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:22,323
Soon? You mean, today?

43
00:08:22,932 --> 00:08:27,976
Absolutely. I even prepared the papers.
It's bad business to let him wait.

44
00:08:32,132 --> 00:08:33,082
Very well.

45
00:08:34,021 --> 00:08:37,810
If you insist, I shall leave today.

46
00:08:43,293 --> 00:08:44,714
Today? Are you serious?

47
00:08:45,831 --> 00:08:47,691
Yes, to a castle in Transylvania.

48
00:08:48,165 --> 00:08:51,887
I hear it's a strange place infested with
wolves and people who see ghosts.

49
00:08:52,473 --> 00:08:53,926
Jonathan, it scares me...

50
00:08:54,315 --> 00:08:55,800
I don't want you to go.

51
00:08:55,864 --> 00:08:56,865
I'll be fine.

52
00:08:57,248 --> 00:08:58,561
You'll be in danger.

53
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:01,116
Don't go.

54
00:09:11,977 --> 00:09:16,004
Wolves. Bandits. And ghosts.

55
00:09:17,003 --> 00:09:20,174
Don't go. I won't allow it.

56
00:09:22,209 --> 00:09:26,518
Let's go to the ocean, now.
To the place where we fell in love.

57
00:09:30,172 --> 00:09:31,256
Lucy...

58
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:38,463
...I don't know.
Sometimes I feel so ignorant.

59
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:42,389
Jonathan, I really have to say this...

60
00:10:43,574 --> 00:10:46,551
...even if you think it comes from...

61
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:50,307
...the weak heart of a woman...

62
00:10:50,814 --> 00:10:52,270
...your wife.

63
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,063
Yes?

64
00:10:56,582 --> 00:10:59,451
It really comes from the strength
of my heart.

65
00:11:03,441 --> 00:11:05,220
I feel a kind of...

66
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:07,216
...dark force...

67
00:11:07,758 --> 00:11:09,992
...like a nameless deadly fear.

68
00:11:27,176 --> 00:11:29,201
Lucy is the dearest thing in the world
to me...

69
00:11:29,845 --> 00:11:32,281
...take care of her.

70
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,931
Mina, treat her as a sister.

71
00:11:40,267 --> 00:11:41,452
Yes.

72
00:14:16,325 --> 00:14:20,009
Innkeeper! Quick, my supper. I must go
to the castle of Count Dracula tonight.

73
00:14:40,001 --> 00:14:42,731
Are you really going there?

74
00:14:43,355 --> 00:14:44,869
Yes. Why?

75
00:14:45,988 --> 00:14:48,340
It's not a safe place.

76
00:14:48,405 --> 00:14:53,338
Why do you want to go there?

77
00:14:55,131 --> 00:15:02,916
At midnight evil spirits come out.
And people disappear without a trace.

78
00:15:02,981 --> 00:15:05,551
Oh, come on, that's all superstition.

79
00:15:05,912 --> 00:15:07,163
Not at all.

80
00:15:07,229 --> 00:15:11,640
Bad things will happen to you if you
go there.

81
00:15:11,706 --> 00:15:15,154
Besides, no coachman will dare
take you there...

82
00:15:15,222 --> 00:15:20,635
...your horse needs a rest
for several days.

83
00:15:21,515 --> 00:15:23,613
I'll find another horse.

84
00:15:26,981 --> 00:15:30,605
Don't go, sir.

85
00:15:31,529 --> 00:15:32,912
I know a few gypsies...

86
00:15:33,737 --> 00:15:38,201
...who have been on the other side...

87
00:15:39,948 --> 00:15:42,418
...and they can tell you.

88
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:22,006
He also says you shouldn't go there,
young man.

89
00:16:43,137 --> 00:16:49,508
He says there's a great chasm on the
way that swallows the unwary.

90
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:51,752
If that doesn't get you,
he says the towering crags will.

91
00:16:51,851 --> 00:16:52,792
And in the Borgo pass...

92
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:56,900
...the light suddenly divides and...

93
00:16:56,968 --> 00:17:01,909
...the land begins to rise
towards the heavens...

94
00:17:01,976 --> 00:17:04,819
...and then it drops. No one has ever
returned from that place.

95
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:25,721
The gypsies say that
no such castle exists there...

96
00:17:25,789 --> 00:17:28,733
...except maybe in the imagination
of man.

97
00:17:29,813 --> 00:17:34,075
There used to be a castle there. But
now it is a ghost castle. It's only a ruin.

98
00:17:35,067 --> 00:17:40,024
And whoever enters into that land of
phantoms is lost...

99
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:43,246
...and never returns.

100
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:36,448
Of vampires and bloodsuckers.

101
00:18:36,787 --> 00:18:43,986
Of corpses which devour their own flesh.
Of incubuses and succubuses.

102
00:18:44,218 --> 00:18:48,188
Of the living dead who follow strangers
in the night...

103
00:18:48,255 --> 00:18:51,400
...and attack them.
Hmm...

104
00:18:57,541 --> 00:19:01,783
Transylvania... Nosferatu,
beyond death...

105
00:19:03,611 --> 00:19:06,249
...a curse that will last till the end of time.

106
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:10,036
The curse of Nosferatu.

107
00:19:26,611 --> 00:19:28,506
Coachman, could you take me to
the Borgo pass?

108
00:19:28,574 --> 00:19:30,029
I'll pay you well.

109
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,600
There is no road to the Borgo pass.

110
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,948
But it's right there.

111
00:19:38,505 --> 00:19:40,062
I need your coach.

112
00:19:40,128 --> 00:19:42,016
I haven't got a coach.

113
00:19:44,999 --> 00:19:48,030
Then I'll take one of your horses.
I'll double the price.

114
00:19:48,129 --> 00:19:50,558
Sorry, sir, but I don't have any
horses. Don't you see?

115
00:19:57,191 --> 00:19:58,226
Well...

116
00:19:58,955 --> 00:20:01,574
I guess I'll have to walk there.

117
00:26:36,395 --> 00:26:38,760
Count Dracula?!

118
00:26:42,989 --> 00:26:46,889
I am Count Dracula.
Welcome to my castle.

119
00:26:47,623 --> 00:26:50,287
You must be Jonathan Harker.

120
00:26:50,353 --> 00:26:51,518
Yes.

121
00:26:53,304 --> 00:26:54,759
Come in.

122
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:59,821
The night is cold and you must be
tired and hungry.

123
00:27:39,646 --> 00:27:41,773
I've got the papers here.

124
00:27:43,738 --> 00:27:47,972
This is the layout of the house...

125
00:27:48,172 --> 00:27:50,305
...which I'm sure you'd like to see.

126
00:27:59,273 --> 00:28:02,374
Yes, yes.

127
00:28:04,608 --> 00:28:06,176
Please, help yourself.

128
00:28:07,163 --> 00:28:09,885
Please, I'm afraid
you must dine alone.

129
00:28:09,953 --> 00:28:14,064
It's nearly midnight and I
partake of nothing at this hour.

130
00:28:27,503 --> 00:28:31,205
Unfortunately, the servants
are not at our disposal.

131
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:37,088
So allow me to see
to your comfort.

132
00:29:28,341 --> 00:29:30,811
Listen.

133
00:29:34,614 --> 00:29:35,583
Listen.

134
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:39,554
The Children of the Night
make their music.

135
00:29:43,992 --> 00:29:46,095
Ah, young man...

136
00:29:47,083 --> 00:29:51,498
...you're like the villagers who cannot
place themselves in the soul of the hunter.

137
00:31:37,181 --> 00:31:39,653
The knife is old and could be dirty.

138
00:31:41,155 --> 00:31:43,727
It could give you blood poisoning.

139
00:31:44,361 --> 00:31:47,701
Please let me do it. It's the oldest
remedy in the world.

140
00:31:47,768 --> 00:31:50,673
Oh, forget it. It's hardly worth
mentioning. Just a little cut.

141
00:32:01,607 --> 00:32:04,146
You... you know...

142
00:32:05,248 --> 00:32:07,786
...it's only for the best.

143
00:32:46,949 --> 00:32:49,824
Let's sit down for a while.

144
00:32:57,843 --> 00:33:00,850
It's still many hours till dawn.

145
00:33:01,719 --> 00:33:04,559
And during the daytime
I am always away.

146
00:40:07,335 --> 00:40:09,289
Lucy, my love...

147
00:40:12,654 --> 00:40:15,635
...there is no postal service
from here...

148
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:22,267
...but I shall write a diary, preserving all
my thoughts and feelings for you.

149
00:40:22,468 --> 00:40:27,493
Last night after a tiresome journey,
I finally reached my destination...

150
00:40:28,396 --> 00:40:30,371
...the castle of Count Dracula.

151
00:40:31,166 --> 00:40:35,278
I had a bad dream,
but I hope it will pass.

152
00:40:35,642 --> 00:40:38,017
This castle is so strange.

153
00:40:38,954 --> 00:40:42,439
At times I wonder if it isn't
part of that dream.

154
00:40:42,539 --> 00:40:45,185
Everything about
it looks so unreal.

155
00:41:23,208 --> 00:41:26,880
I don't attach importance to the
sunshine anymore...

156
00:41:27,471 --> 00:41:30,117
...or to glittering fountains,
which youth is so fond of.

157
00:41:31,857 --> 00:41:34,338
I love the darkness
and the shadows.

158
00:41:36,146 --> 00:41:39,229
Where I can be alone
with my thoughts.

159
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:49,827
I am the descendent
of an old family.

160
00:41:54,372 --> 00:41:58,160
Time is an abyss, profound as
a thousand nights.

161
00:42:00,406 --> 00:42:02,883
Centuries come and go...

162
00:42:04,492 --> 00:42:07,808
...to be unable to grow old is terrible.

163
00:42:08,345 --> 00:42:12,165
That is not the worst. There are
things more horrible than that.

164
00:42:14,024 --> 00:42:17,827
Can you imagine enduring centuries...

165
00:42:18,865 --> 00:42:22,853
...experiencing the same futility
each day?

166
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:29,957
I'm glad you found such a large
old house for me.

167
00:42:30,023 --> 00:42:32,739
Very near your lodging,
I understand.

168
00:42:32,939 --> 00:42:35,268
Yes, it's just around the corner.

169
00:42:35,334 --> 00:42:37,259
Ah...

170
00:42:38,188 --> 00:42:40,345
...may I have a look
at the contract?

171
00:42:51,836 --> 00:42:52,773
What?...

172
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,555
What a lovely throat.

173
00:42:57,432 --> 00:43:00,094
It's my wife, Lucy.

174
00:43:04,244 --> 00:43:05,206
Your hand.

175
00:43:07,316 --> 00:43:08,988
Your hand is so cold.

176
00:43:11,669 --> 00:43:14,551
The document... the contract for
the house, I must sign it immediately.

177
00:43:16,663 --> 00:43:18,808
Yes, but we haven't
settled on a price.

178
00:43:18,875 --> 00:43:20,619
It doesn't matter
between gentlemen...

179
00:43:20,685 --> 00:43:22,695
...I accept whatever
you find just.

180
00:43:38,005 --> 00:43:41,290
How long did it take you
to get here from Wismar?

181
00:43:41,725 --> 00:43:42,899
Four weeks.

182
00:43:48,653 --> 00:43:49,782
I...

183
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:56,845
...it takes a while
to travel on land.

184
00:44:47,227 --> 00:44:50,844
From the seed of Belial is the
vampire born.

185
00:44:51,884 --> 00:44:55,202
He who feeds on the
blood of mankind...

186
00:44:55,839 --> 00:45:02,436
...who, unredeemed, taketh
his refuge in caves, tombs...

187
00:45:02,601 --> 00:45:07,982
...coffins filled with the
unblessed soil of cemeteries...

188
00:45:08,381 --> 00:45:11,497
...wherein the black death
has reaped its harvest...

189
00:45:12,188 --> 00:45:13,894
...the plague.

190
00:47:23,967 --> 00:47:25,644
Jonathan!

191
00:47:51,411 --> 00:47:53,826
She has a sudden fever.

192
00:47:56,421 --> 00:47:58,983
Her pulse is too fast.

193
00:48:00,745 --> 00:48:02,542
She needs to rest.

194
00:48:04,637 --> 00:48:08,053
Call me if you think
it is necessary...

195
00:48:08,657 --> 00:48:10,971
...but I don't think
it's something serious.

196
00:50:58,987 --> 00:51:01,472
Oh, God, he must
be going to Wismar.

197
00:51:01,969 --> 00:51:03,176
Lucy...

198
00:51:04,351 --> 00:51:06,667
Lucy's in danger.

199
00:51:07,171 --> 00:51:08,882
I've got to get out of here.

200
00:53:13,122 --> 00:53:14,762
It's strange...

201
00:53:17,661 --> 00:53:20,060
...but the papers
are all in order.

202
00:53:20,493 --> 00:53:24,557
Let me see them...
From Varna to Wismar.

203
00:53:24,657 --> 00:53:27,456
Garden soil for
botanical experiments.

204
00:53:30,485 --> 00:53:31,841
Open one of them.

205
00:53:33,517 --> 00:53:35,230
I want to make sure.

206
00:53:35,565 --> 00:53:36,807
This one.

207
00:54:04,448 --> 00:54:09,348
Mother Superior...
stop the black coffins.

208
00:55:04,368 --> 00:55:06,968
The patient who came yesterday
had a seizure.

209
00:55:07,034 --> 00:55:07,935
Which one?

210
00:55:08,002 --> 00:55:09,201
The one who had bitten a cow.

211
00:55:09,267 --> 00:55:10,199
Oh, yes.

212
00:55:10,266 --> 00:55:11,325
We put him in isolation.

213
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:12,727
I'll go with you.

214
00:55:15,983 --> 00:55:17,461
Blood is life.

215
00:55:22,195 --> 00:55:23,427
Blood is life.

216
00:55:23,495 --> 00:55:25,161
Has he done it for long?

217
00:55:25,229 --> 00:55:28,797
He has, and he also refuses food.

218
00:55:29,762 --> 00:55:30,995
Blood is life.

219
00:55:31,062 --> 00:55:32,530
Let's go.

220
00:55:35,193 --> 00:55:36,651
Help! Help me!

221
00:56:00,454 --> 00:56:01,413
Be quiet...

222
00:56:01,711 --> 00:56:03,691
I hear the sounds of sails
fluttering in the wind.

223
00:56:28,316 --> 00:56:29,728
Still, there's no letter from him.

224
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:32,974
But, don't worry, Lucy...

225
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:37,809
The mail from Transylvania
is very slow.

226
00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:41,111
Something has happened
to Jonathan.

227
00:56:41,813 --> 00:56:45,246
Have courage, Lucy. God is
listening to our prayers.

228
00:56:47,147 --> 00:56:50,973
God is far away
when we need him.

229
00:57:01,469 --> 00:57:04,171
Young man. You're not yet well.
You shouldn't travel.

230
00:57:04,237 --> 00:57:07,906
The black coffins... I must get
to Wismar before the coffins.

231
00:57:07,973 --> 00:57:11,176
You should at least wait for the
doctor. He'll be here tomorrow.

232
00:57:11,242 --> 00:57:15,471
Lucy, my wife, is in danger.
I must save her.

233
00:57:17,366 --> 00:57:19,248
The black coffins.

234
00:57:19,383 --> 00:57:21,193
Evil is on the way.

235
00:58:03,633 --> 00:58:09,575
I'm writing because I believe
there is a curse on my ship.

236
00:58:10,546 --> 00:58:16,284
One by one, four sailors and the
second mate have taken ill and died.

237
00:58:17,651 --> 00:58:21,321
Another sailor and our cook have
disappeared without a trace.

238
00:58:22,690 --> 00:58:28,928
A rumor of a mysterious stranger
on board scares everyone to death.

239
00:58:29,496 --> 00:58:35,839
We searched the boat and we found
nothing, except rats.

240
00:58:36,438 --> 00:58:39,442
We are maintaining our course.

241
00:58:39,542 --> 00:58:42,846
Northwest at 30 degrees.
The wind is steady. 12 knots.

242
00:59:04,535 --> 00:59:06,004
Mr. Renfield...

243
00:59:06,372 --> 00:59:11,311
...you sent my husband
to Transylvania...

244
00:59:12,244 --> 00:59:14,914
...and I haven't heard
from him in weeks.

245
00:59:15,114 --> 00:59:17,316
I'm very concerned...

246
00:59:18,785 --> 00:59:21,875
...I want to go there and look for him.

247
00:59:25,492 --> 00:59:28,529
Don't go yet.
My master is coming.

248
00:59:29,230 --> 00:59:31,064
Who did you say is coming?

249
00:59:31,832 --> 00:59:33,801
The Lord of the Rats.

250
00:59:35,436 --> 00:59:39,775
He's bringing with him thousands
and thousands of rats.

251
00:59:42,645 --> 00:59:47,138
Orderly, give him some more food.
I think we should leave now.

252
01:00:07,572 --> 01:00:08,541
The plague.

253
01:03:52,397 --> 01:03:54,166
The Master has arrived.

254
01:04:04,866 --> 01:04:06,702
The Master has arrived.

255
01:04:36,807 --> 01:04:38,712
Lay a gangplank across.

256
01:04:38,778 --> 01:04:40,816
We need to search the ship.

257
01:05:05,778 --> 01:05:07,048
Cut him loose.

258
01:05:26,363 --> 01:05:30,238
There's not a soul on board.
Just some freight.

259
01:05:31,307 --> 01:05:34,278
But there are rats everywhere.

260
01:05:34,478 --> 01:05:37,090
Here's the ship's log.

261
01:06:25,686 --> 01:06:28,180
It's truly a mystery.

262
01:06:30,050 --> 01:06:35,432
I think, gentlemen, that the ship's log
may give us a clue.

263
01:06:38,608 --> 01:06:44,890
Varna, June 6. Myself, the Captain, five
hands, two mates and a cook...

264
01:06:45,224 --> 01:06:47,430
...direction, the Dardanelles.

265
01:06:51,772 --> 01:06:53,408
Course westward.

266
01:06:53,743 --> 01:06:56,650
Today a third man died of a high fever.

267
01:06:57,218 --> 01:07:02,500
Last night, while on his watch,
a mate disappeared without a trace.

268
01:07:02,933 --> 01:07:06,376
June 20th. Course northward
towards Biscaya.

269
01:07:06,442 --> 01:07:08,415
Speed 40 knots. Tall waves.

270
01:07:08,482 --> 01:07:10,888
Fear grows among my men.

271
01:07:11,154 --> 01:07:15,936
Now only the first mate
and I remain alive.

272
01:07:16,169 --> 01:07:19,873
There are rats everywhere.
Could it be a plague?

273
01:07:22,948 --> 01:07:25,856
Go home quietly, please.

274
01:07:26,423 --> 01:07:29,032
Shut the doors and windows,
gentlemen.

275
01:11:50,969 --> 01:11:53,438
Gracious lady, we brought this man.

276
01:11:54,006 --> 01:11:56,416
He says he lives here.

277
01:11:56,783 --> 01:11:57,853
Lucy!

278
01:12:00,062 --> 01:12:01,266
Jonathan!

279
01:12:14,507 --> 01:12:16,195
Who is this woman?

280
01:12:27,030 --> 01:12:28,669
Bring him in, please.

281
01:12:42,589 --> 01:12:48,312
It looks like he's suffering
from brain fever.

282
01:12:55,001 --> 01:12:57,177
The sun is hurting my eyes.

283
01:13:14,176 --> 01:13:19,127
Dr. Van Helsing. Do you think
we've all gone mad...

284
01:13:19,697 --> 01:13:23,604
...and that one morning we'll all wake up
and find ourselves in straight-jackets?

285
01:15:50,137 --> 01:15:53,398
Excuse me for not knocking...

286
01:15:54,531 --> 01:15:56,695
...I am Count Dracula.

287
01:15:58,358 --> 01:16:00,416
I know who you are.

288
01:16:01,177 --> 01:16:04,722
I read Jonathan's diary.

289
01:16:05,993 --> 01:16:09,375
He wrote everything that went on
in your castle, while he was there.

290
01:16:10,010 --> 01:16:13,559
- Don't worry, he won't die.
- Yes...

291
01:16:14,497 --> 01:16:16,827
...he will. Death surrounds us.

292
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:20,090
We're all at his will.

293
01:16:25,375 --> 01:16:28,846
The rivers continue
to flow without us.

294
01:16:30,587 --> 01:16:32,561
Time flies by.

295
01:16:33,967 --> 01:16:35,876
Even the stars...

296
01:16:36,578 --> 01:16:40,157
...they wander towards us
in a very strange way.

297
01:16:41,655 --> 01:16:43,618
Only death is certain.

298
01:16:44,385 --> 01:16:46,349
Only death is cruel.

299
01:16:48,114 --> 01:16:51,067
Death is cruelty
against the unsuspecting.

300
01:16:51,635 --> 01:16:54,208
But that's not what I perceive as cruel.

301
01:16:55,246 --> 01:16:59,028
Cruel is when you can't die
even if you want to.

302
01:16:59,732 --> 01:17:02,310
Give me some of your love...

303
01:17:02,411 --> 01:17:05,051
...which you give Jonathan.

304
01:17:07,015 --> 01:17:08,679
I never will.

305
01:17:08,845 --> 01:17:12,608
I won't even give that love to God.

306
01:17:13,508 --> 01:17:15,862
If Jonathan can't have my love...

307
01:17:15,961 --> 01:17:17,729
...then, no one else will.

308
01:17:18,166 --> 01:17:20,140
If I wish, he'll recognize you again.

309
01:17:20,677 --> 01:17:24,025
But first, come and give me your love.

310
01:17:24,492 --> 01:17:26,937
Only then, will I give you
your husband back.

311
01:17:27,505 --> 01:17:29,011
And as for me...

312
01:17:30,643 --> 01:17:33,607
...the absence of love...

313
01:17:34,773 --> 01:17:38,469
...is the most abject pain.

314
01:17:40,128 --> 01:17:43,329
The power of my love
will bring him back to me.

315
01:17:45,269 --> 01:17:47,378
And you may be assured...

316
01:17:48,584 --> 01:17:50,559
...even the unthinkable will not
deter me...

317
01:17:50,692 --> 01:17:53,338
...that you want to lay for me.

318
01:18:08,891 --> 01:18:10,364
Good night.

319
01:19:11,817 --> 01:19:12,783
Stop!

320
01:19:16,314 --> 01:19:20,005
Help! Help!

321
01:19:40,308 --> 01:19:43,374
Nosferatu, the undead.

322
01:19:43,906 --> 01:19:48,335
He drinks the blood of his victims, and
turns them into phantoms of the night.

323
01:19:49,575 --> 01:19:53,157
Like a shadow, he has no reflection.

324
01:19:54,831 --> 01:19:58,040
He goes through walls and closed
doors...

325
01:19:58,339 --> 01:20:01,271
...as if they never existed.

326
01:20:01,837 --> 01:20:05,569
Like a bat, he wafts into dark bedrooms.

327
01:20:05,803 --> 01:20:11,023
Masquerading as a black wolf,
he hunts his fleeing victims.

328
01:20:11,391 --> 01:20:14,971
Abandon all hope,
you who cross his path.

329
01:20:26,065 --> 01:20:30,030
Yet even vampires, who are
considered unnatural creatures...

330
01:20:30,129 --> 01:20:34,061
...are subject to some laws of nature.

331
01:20:34,692 --> 01:20:37,588
The sight of the cross bans him.

332
01:20:38,056 --> 01:20:40,768
The consecrated host...

333
01:20:40,836 --> 01:20:46,694
...can bar his retreat.

334
01:20:47,527 --> 01:20:50,960
And if a pure hearted woman...

335
01:20:51,625 --> 01:20:54,291
...diverts his attention
from the cry of the cock...

336
01:20:54,659 --> 01:20:58,556
...the first light of day will obliterate him.

337
01:21:19,551 --> 01:21:22,519
What is your wish, Master?

338
01:21:27,342 --> 01:21:28,817
Go north...

339
01:21:31,059 --> 01:21:32,534
...to Riga.

340
01:21:34,008 --> 01:21:38,048
The army of rats and the Black Death
will follow you.

341
01:21:40,180 --> 01:21:42,279
Oh... Thy will be done.

342
01:21:42,381 --> 01:21:45,147
Amen...!
Amen...!

343
01:22:27,302 --> 01:22:30,169
The plague! The plague!
What are you doing here?

344
01:22:30,302 --> 01:22:31,968
I must talk to the town council.

345
01:22:32,068 --> 01:22:34,535
It's been dissolved.
It doesn't exist anymore.

346
01:22:34,969 --> 01:22:36,234
Then, I must see the mayor.

347
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:39,134
He's dead.
Go back home, as fast as you can.

348
01:22:40,194 --> 01:22:43,129
I know why this evil is happening!

349
01:22:43,968 --> 01:22:47,319
I know why this evil is happening!

350
01:22:48,156 --> 01:22:50,928
Why won't you listen to me?!

351
01:22:52,996 --> 01:22:55,128
I know the reason why.

352
01:23:14,355 --> 01:23:17,855
My child. It's all a figment
of your imagination.

353
01:23:18,357 --> 01:23:20,089
But Dr. Van Helsing...

354
01:23:20,889 --> 01:23:24,623
...you've read
Jonathan's diary.

355
01:23:25,190 --> 01:23:28,158
You've seen what has
happened to him.

356
01:23:28,790 --> 01:23:30,983
It's getting worse here every day.

357
01:23:31,115 --> 01:23:32,820
The plague. The rats.

358
01:23:36,036 --> 01:23:40,115
And this book about the vampires.

359
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:43,850
This book explains it.

360
01:23:46,317 --> 01:23:48,383
This is an enlightened century.

361
01:23:48,485 --> 01:23:52,418
Science has refuted the superstitions
you're talking about.

362
01:23:53,052 --> 01:23:54,945
I know it exists.

363
01:23:55,046 --> 01:23:57,779
I believe what I see with my own eyes.

364
01:23:58,182 --> 01:23:59,992
Faith... Faith...

365
01:24:00,495 --> 01:24:02,539
Yes, faith.

366
01:24:02,941 --> 01:24:05,042
Yes, faith, Dr. Van Helsing.

367
01:24:05,442 --> 01:24:06,443
Faith.

368
01:24:07,544 --> 01:24:10,611
Faith is the faculty in men...

369
01:24:10,710 --> 01:24:13,912
...which enables us to believe things...

370
01:24:13,978 --> 01:24:16,413
...we know to be untrue.

371
01:24:19,574 --> 01:24:22,911
You must come and help me
destroy this monster.

372
01:24:23,815 --> 01:24:25,892
We must look for him.

373
01:24:26,932 --> 01:24:29,303
Coffins have come by boat
from the Black Sea.

374
01:24:29,636 --> 01:24:32,604
We can search for them tonight,
and destroy them.

375
01:24:32,870 --> 01:24:37,506
My child, you need some rest.

376
01:24:38,205 --> 01:24:40,906
Your husband's condition has
worn you out.

377
01:24:41,174 --> 01:24:43,042
No, Dr. Van Helsing.
Tonight.

378
01:24:43,108 --> 01:24:47,134
I need to study this matter
scientifically.

379
01:24:47,235 --> 01:24:52,428
No! Tonight! There's no time to lose.

380
01:24:52,931 --> 01:24:56,998
Even a farmer knows that there's
a time to plant and a time to sow.

381
01:24:57,131 --> 01:25:01,901
He doesn't dig up the wheat to check
if it is growing.

382
01:25:01,966 --> 01:25:06,636
Only children playing farmers
would do such things.

383
01:25:12,464 --> 01:25:16,887
I guess I'll have to do this alone!

384
01:25:23,526 --> 01:25:25,292
Well, then.

385
01:25:57,392 --> 01:26:00,186
Mother Superior, my medicine.

386
01:26:12,046 --> 01:26:15,449
My lady, how exactly did we meet?

387
01:32:53,422 --> 01:32:54,391
Join us, please.

388
01:32:54,490 --> 01:32:57,162
Would you like a drink?
Be our guest.

389
01:32:57,696 --> 01:33:01,869
We've all contracted the plague. Let's
enjoy whatever time we have to live.

390
01:33:22,023 --> 01:33:25,428
Madam Lucy! Madam Lucy!
Open up!

391
01:33:28,499 --> 01:33:31,592
Come quickly to the Schraders...

392
01:33:32,126 --> 01:33:34,095
Something terrible has happened there.

393
01:34:02,895 --> 01:34:06,101
Lucy, calm down.

394
01:34:06,201 --> 01:34:09,540
You can come closer.
It is not the plague.

395
01:34:12,180 --> 01:34:15,752
My God! What happened?

396
01:34:16,085 --> 01:34:17,623
I don't know exactly.

397
01:34:17,722 --> 01:34:21,180
She was already dead, when I arrived.

398
01:34:22,679 --> 01:34:27,121
He lost his sanity over it,
he started to rave.

399
01:34:30,093 --> 01:34:34,502
We shall study this
matter scientifically...

400
01:34:34,569 --> 01:34:38,375
...without prejudice,
and without superstition.

401
01:34:41,514 --> 01:34:45,808
Enough! Enough. Stop acting like
you know everything.

402
01:34:47,104 --> 01:34:50,812
I know, now, what I've got to do.

403
01:35:21,418 --> 01:35:25,394
The consecrated host
bans the vampire.

404
01:35:48,016 --> 01:35:53,459
And if a pure hearted woman, diverts
his attention from the cry of the cock...

405
01:35:54,497 --> 01:35:57,870
...the first light of day will obliterate him.

406
01:42:26,762 --> 01:42:30,472
Too late. Oh, God...

407
01:42:30,539 --> 01:42:33,777
...if I had only listened to her.

408
01:42:43,565 --> 01:42:47,042
A stake and a hammer.

409
01:42:47,945 --> 01:42:51,321
I have to dispatch this demon forever.

410
01:43:05,722 --> 01:43:09,162
Stop. Don't do it!

411
01:43:40,442 --> 01:43:41,445
Van Helsing!

412
01:43:42,415 --> 01:43:44,051
Get him! Yes, him!

413
01:43:44,552 --> 01:43:46,527
That man has murdered the Count!

414
01:43:48,427 --> 01:43:49,925
Have you done that?

415
01:43:52,889 --> 01:43:54,279
With that stake?

416
01:43:54,512 --> 01:43:58,348
Yes...
But I had a good reason for doing it.

417
01:43:58,414 --> 01:43:59,919
That's for the courts to decide.

418
01:44:00,220 --> 01:44:02,862
You're under arrest, Dr. Van Helsing.

419
01:44:03,731 --> 01:44:04,901
Arrest this man.

420
01:44:06,039 --> 01:44:07,176
Arrest him?

421
01:44:07,377 --> 01:44:10,118
- I can't arrest him.
- Then get the police.

422
01:44:10,185 --> 01:44:11,953
The police don't exist anymore.

423
01:44:12,220 --> 01:44:14,285
Then take him to prison.

424
01:44:14,418 --> 01:44:16,749
There's no one there to guard him.

425
01:44:16,816 --> 01:44:18,777
It's your duty as a town employee
to handle it.

426
01:44:18,879 --> 01:44:20,906
I don't have a weapon.

427
01:44:21,005 --> 01:44:23,810
I don't care!
I want you to arrest this man!

428
01:44:24,712 --> 01:44:27,254
Where will you take me, then?

429
01:44:31,368 --> 01:44:33,140
I don't know where I'm taking you.

430
01:44:33,206 --> 01:44:36,548
Take me wherever you want.

431
01:44:39,012 --> 01:44:40,844
Don't just stand there.

432
01:44:41,945 --> 01:44:46,865
Get a broom. It's all dusty.

433
01:45:10,895 --> 01:45:14,435
Seal the room for
an official investigation.

434
01:45:15,304 --> 01:45:18,648
And bring me my horse.

435
01:45:18,983 --> 01:45:23,531
I have much to do.
Now!
