1
00:00:52,012 --> 00:00:54,503
Most people think of themselves
as individuals,

2
00:00:54,681 --> 00:00:56,763
that there's no-one
on the planet like them.

3
00:00:56,934 --> 00:00:58,925
This thought motivates them
to get out of bed,

4
00:00:59,102 --> 00:01:01,514
eat food, and walk around
like nothing's wrong.

5
00:01:01,688 --> 00:01:04,179
My name is Oliver Tate.

6
00:01:06,777 --> 00:01:08,859
# ALEX TURNER: Stuck On The Puzzle

7
00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:34,886
# I'm not the kind of fool
who's gonna sit and sing to you

8
00:01:36,098 --> 00:01:39,932
# About stars, girl

9
00:01:40,102 --> 00:01:42,218
# But last night I looked up

10
00:01:42,396 --> 00:01:46,514
# Into the dark half of the blue

11
00:01:47,109 --> 00:01:51,193
# And they'd gone backwards

12
00:01:54,449 --> 00:01:57,566
"What kind of young person am I?"

13
00:01:57,744 --> 00:02:00,360
That's the challenge.
We talk about challenges.

14
00:02:00,539 --> 00:02:03,497
Well, that's the challenge
I'm giving you this term.

15
00:02:03,667 --> 00:02:05,623
A gauntlet, so to speak.

16
00:02:05,794 --> 00:02:08,831
But this gauntlet is
also an opportunity.

17
00:02:09,006 --> 00:02:12,373
An opportunity for self-discovery.

18
00:02:12,551 --> 00:02:15,543
What do I mean by "self-discovery"?
Mark Pritchard?

19
00:02:16,305 --> 00:02:18,842
Having a wank, sir?

20
00:02:19,933 --> 00:02:22,299
Discovery of the self.

21
00:02:22,477 --> 00:02:24,342
Who am I?

22
00:02:24,521 --> 00:02:26,807
I find that the only way
to get through life

23
00:02:26,982 --> 00:02:30,474
is to picture myself
in an entirely disconnected reality.

24
00:02:31,153 --> 00:02:33,565
I often imagine
how people would react to my death.

25
00:02:35,157 --> 00:02:39,116
Mr Dunthorne's quavering voice
as he makes the announcement.

26
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,782
The shocked faces of my classmates.

27
00:02:44,374 --> 00:02:47,241
A playground bedecked with flowers.

28
00:02:48,253 --> 00:02:51,120
The empty stillness
of a school corridor.

29
00:02:52,382 --> 00:02:53,792
Local news analysis.

30
00:02:53,967 --> 00:02:56,754
Oliver Tate was a popular
and much-loved pupil.

31
00:02:56,928 --> 00:03:00,796
Many of the people I've spoken to here
referred to him as an example.

32
00:03:00,974 --> 00:03:03,090
He was so funny and so smart.

33
00:03:03,268 --> 00:03:05,884
He's gonna be really missed.
It's so bad. He's so young.

34
00:03:06,063 --> 00:03:07,599
Tear-streaked tributes.

35
00:03:10,859 --> 00:03:14,693
I just wanted to hug him.
I just wish I had.

36
00:03:14,863 --> 00:03:19,027
I wish I could have said goodbye,
but I never said anything to him.

37
00:03:19,201 --> 00:03:21,112
The steady stoicism of my parents.

38
00:03:21,286 --> 00:03:23,823
All the girls liked him.

39
00:03:24,873 --> 00:03:27,285
Other boys respected him,
looked up to him, I guess.

40
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:28,539
Candlelit vigils.

41
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:34,250
We are witnessing incredible,
unprecedented scenes of quiet devotion.

42
00:03:34,424 --> 00:03:39,794
Behind me a vigil that's been repeated
all over the country,

43
00:03:39,971 --> 00:03:44,214
A testimony to the love felt
for Oliver Tate

44
00:03:44,393 --> 00:03:47,351
and the loss felt by his friends...

45
00:03:47,521 --> 00:03:51,935
and, frankly, by Wales on the whole.

46
00:03:53,026 --> 00:03:55,392
And, finally, my glorious resurrection.

47
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:01,026
Don't ask how. Just know
that I'm now more powerful than ever.

48
00:04:05,622 --> 00:04:07,658
Let's get off.

49
00:04:28,061 --> 00:04:30,097
Zoe.

50
00:04:30,272 --> 00:04:33,230
Zoe, this is for you. It's yours.
It has your name on it. Take it.

51
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,140
- It's not mine.
- Please take it.

52
00:04:35,318 --> 00:04:38,276
That note seems fascinating,
Oliver Tate.

53
00:04:38,447 --> 00:04:40,779
You know the rules.
Stand up and read it out.

54
00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:44,862
I can't. It's Zoe's.
She gave it to me and I was gonna...

55
00:04:47,038 --> 00:04:49,996
Saved by the bell once again, Mr Tate.

56
00:04:50,167 --> 00:04:51,577
All right, take your time.

57
00:04:51,752 --> 00:04:55,370
I know you're all gagging
to get to double Biology but don't rush.

58
00:05:12,731 --> 00:05:16,895
Jordana Bevan's only real flaws
are her sporadic bouts of eczema.

59
00:05:17,694 --> 00:05:19,650
Other than that, she has many qualities.

60
00:05:20,405 --> 00:05:23,067
She never speaks about herself.
She could be anything.

61
00:05:23,241 --> 00:05:25,152
Perhaps she's a Fabian.

62
00:05:25,327 --> 00:05:28,319
That would make her a socialist
who advocates gradual change.

63
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:33,414
She's moderately unpopular, which
makes a romance between us more likely.

64
00:05:33,585 --> 00:05:36,748
She's also a girl - to be seen with her
would improve my street cred,

65
00:05:36,922 --> 00:05:38,662
which, though high, could be higher.

66
00:05:46,264 --> 00:05:48,255
Lastly, she's now single,

67
00:05:48,433 --> 00:05:51,925
cos Mark Pritchard cheated on her
with Abby Smuts at the school disco.

68
00:05:52,103 --> 00:05:56,016
The full extent of the betrayal
is still the subject of speculation.

69
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:01,443
Chips knows there's
nothing more attractive than a bully.

70
00:06:01,613 --> 00:06:03,820
He also knows that Zoe Preece
is a legitimate target

71
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:07,027
because she's overweight
and won't accept notes in class.

72
00:06:08,537 --> 00:06:10,778
Essentially, I disapprove of bullying.

73
00:06:11,581 --> 00:06:13,697
Jordana seems to enjoy it in moderation.

74
00:06:15,627 --> 00:06:18,664
I must not let my principles
stand in the way of progress.

75
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:20,955
I must be willing to adapt.

76
00:06:24,386 --> 00:06:25,842
Keep up, Tubs!

77
00:06:28,515 --> 00:06:30,506
This was the correct decision.

78
00:06:31,518 --> 00:06:33,099
Give it back now!

79
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:36,888
This was a vivid memory of youth that I
would cherish when I was old and frail.

80
00:06:37,065 --> 00:06:38,225
Oh!

81
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,140
Catch. Straight into the hands.

82
00:06:40,318 --> 00:06:43,651
We were working as a team,
testing each other's limits,

83
00:06:43,822 --> 00:06:47,485
challenging one another's bourgeois
assumptions of what was acceptable.

84
00:06:47,659 --> 00:06:49,820
Oh, grow up! Grow up!

85
00:06:50,495 --> 00:06:53,828
I knew that these events - although
hard to bear at this precise moment -

86
00:06:53,999 --> 00:06:57,162
would help build Zoe Preece's
character in the long term.

87
00:07:11,683 --> 00:07:12,798
Aargh!

88
00:07:20,609 --> 00:07:22,600
Wanker!

89
00:07:31,286 --> 00:07:32,867
Honestly, Zoe, it was an accident.

90
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:36,405
I mean, it was just unlucky that
you were there and that you fell in.

91
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:40,201
We were playing... sort of like a game.

92
00:07:41,671 --> 00:07:44,162
And you can replace the stuff
that was in your bag.

93
00:07:44,341 --> 00:07:47,424
- I'm not saying it's cheap...
- Fuck off and die!

94
00:07:54,601 --> 00:07:56,887
In many ways, I prefer my own company.

95
00:07:57,062 --> 00:07:58,893
It gives me time to think.

96
00:07:59,064 --> 00:08:02,727
I suppose it's a bit of an affectation,
but I often read the dictionary.

97
00:08:02,901 --> 00:08:07,019
My word for today is "flagitious",
which means wickedly shameful.

98
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,911
I live in a large house with my parents.

99
00:08:21,086 --> 00:08:23,828
They tell me that our area
has breathtaking scenery.

100
00:08:25,924 --> 00:08:28,085
I'm not sure I believe in scenery.

101
00:08:29,678 --> 00:08:32,294
However, the views allow me
to spy on our new neighbours.

102
00:08:32,472 --> 00:08:35,589
I don't know them yet but they
seem like terrible human beings.

103
00:08:39,354 --> 00:08:41,015
Ninjas.

104
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:47,772
My parents have not had sex
for seven months.

105
00:08:48,446 --> 00:08:51,779
I've been monitoring their intimacy
via the dimmer switch in their bedroom.

106
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:55,738
I know when they've been at it
because the dial will be set to halfway.

107
00:09:04,004 --> 00:09:07,246
I wish life could be more like
American soap operas.

108
00:09:07,424 --> 00:09:09,585
Then, whenever things got dramatic,

109
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:13,547
you could just fade the picture down
and pick things up again later.

110
00:09:17,767 --> 00:09:21,635
Can you tell your mother to hurry up?
I'll be waiting in the road.

111
00:09:24,691 --> 00:09:27,273
- You look nice.
- Thank you.

112
00:09:27,444 --> 00:09:30,186
Yeah, you look good for your age.
For a mum.

113
00:09:32,907 --> 00:09:34,863
Mum's getting the bus.

114
00:09:35,035 --> 00:09:37,868
So... I inherited it all.

115
00:09:38,038 --> 00:09:41,997
Well, er, it's been terrific.
Small world, all that.

116
00:09:42,167 --> 00:09:44,032
It's such a lovely area.

117
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:46,667
This used to be
Jill's grandmother's house, right?

118
00:09:46,838 --> 00:09:48,829
Yes.

119
00:09:49,007 --> 00:09:52,920
The hours we spent up in that room,
listening to records, hatching plans.

120
00:09:53,094 --> 00:09:55,961
Right, yes.
So are you going to be selling up?

121
00:09:56,139 --> 00:09:58,505
Just gonna let things
take their own path.

122
00:09:59,851 --> 00:10:02,137
- You have a good day, Lloyd.
- OK, cheers, Graham.

123
00:10:02,312 --> 00:10:04,177
- Give my love to Jill.
- Will do.

124
00:10:04,355 --> 00:10:06,346
- Ciao, Lloyd.
- Goodbye.

125
00:10:16,493 --> 00:10:18,404
- You go get 'em, killer.
- I will.

126
00:10:19,204 --> 00:10:21,946
As usual,
Dad drops me 800 yards from school.

127
00:10:22,123 --> 00:10:25,866
That way, I can slip in unnoticed,
like a torpedo.

128
00:10:26,044 --> 00:10:27,875
Watch your step, motherfucker! Ha-ha

129
00:10:28,046 --> 00:10:30,788
You've got to wake up.
How many times have I told you?

130
00:10:30,965 --> 00:10:32,705
- Ellis?
- Yes, sir.

131
00:10:32,884 --> 00:10:34,545
- Griffiths?
- Here, sir.

132
00:10:34,719 --> 00:10:36,084
- Harris?
- Yes, sir.

133
00:10:36,262 --> 00:10:37,752
- Davies?
- Yes, sir.

134
00:10:37,931 --> 00:10:39,546
- Morris?
- Sir.

135
00:10:39,724 --> 00:10:41,089
Preece?

136
00:10:41,267 --> 00:10:43,804
Preece? Anyone seen Zoe?

137
00:10:45,647 --> 00:10:48,013
- Tate?
- Yeah, present.

138
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:50,182
- Pritchard?
- Yes.

139
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,816
Smuts?

140
00:10:58,952 --> 00:11:00,567
Wanker!

141
00:11:00,745 --> 00:11:03,077
Zoe Preece hasn't been
in school for a while,

142
00:11:03,248 --> 00:11:07,241
so I've written a pamphlet
on how to break out of the victim cycle.

143
00:11:08,711 --> 00:11:11,453
I've also given her two examples
to inspire her.

144
00:11:11,631 --> 00:11:13,167
Firstly, Rhydian Bird,

145
00:11:13,341 --> 00:11:16,253
who pulled his trousers down to fart
and followed through,

146
00:11:16,427 --> 00:11:19,009
calling an unhealthy turd
onto the tarmac.

147
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:23,298
But instead of looking embarrassed,
he screamed with laughter and pointed.

148
00:11:23,476 --> 00:11:25,842
Nobody could tease him about it
cos he was so proud.

149
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,726
How do you even know all men read poems?

150
00:11:27,897 --> 00:11:30,138
All men do, unless you're gay.
Are you gay?

151
00:11:30,316 --> 00:11:32,773
Secondly, Chips.
He wasn't even considered hot

152
00:11:32,944 --> 00:11:36,232
until the Watkins twins stabbed him
in the back with compasses.

153
00:11:36,406 --> 00:11:38,647
He said nothing, showed no discomfort

154
00:11:38,825 --> 00:11:41,111
as his shirt blossomed
with blood poppies.

155
00:11:41,286 --> 00:11:44,699
His stoicism reminded me of the brave
men who died in the First World War.

156
00:11:45,456 --> 00:11:47,196
Chips is an outstanding bully.

157
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:50,959
He once made our Religious Education
teacher cry using only Blu-Tack.

158
00:11:51,129 --> 00:11:52,744
Right, now, now, now.

159
00:11:56,176 --> 00:11:57,791
I don't quite know what I am yet.

160
00:11:57,969 --> 00:11:59,925
I've tried smoking a pipe...

161
00:12:00,096 --> 00:12:01,757
., flipping coins...

162
00:12:01,931 --> 00:12:04,593
listening exclusively
to French crooners.

163
00:12:04,767 --> 00:12:07,554
Other times I go to the beach
and stare at the sea.

164
00:12:07,729 --> 00:12:10,516
Someone made a documentary
about a prominent thinker

165
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:12,646
who struggled with unspeakable loss.

166
00:12:12,817 --> 00:12:15,854
I've even had a brief hat phase.
But nothing stuck.

167
00:12:27,373 --> 00:12:28,988
- Gene.
- What?

168
00:12:29,167 --> 00:12:31,158
The most secure route
to Zoe is big Gene,

169
00:12:31,336 --> 00:12:34,954
who, over the last few months, has
become her only friend and confidante.

170
00:12:35,131 --> 00:12:37,042
Gene told me that Zoe had moved schools.

171
00:12:37,217 --> 00:12:39,483
She was very unhappy
because she was bullied

172
00:12:39,485 --> 00:12:41,426
and one boy even pushed her into a pond.

173
00:12:41,596 --> 00:12:43,427
Oh... I had no idea.

174
00:12:43,598 --> 00:12:46,635
I persuaded her to give Zoe the pamphlet
by saying it was a love letter.

175
00:12:46,809 --> 00:12:48,219
It's a big love letter.

176
00:12:48,394 --> 00:12:50,305
I've got a big heart.

177
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,472
Sometimes I wish there was a film crew
following my every move.

178
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:56,733
I imagine the camera craning up
as I walk away.

179
00:12:56,903 --> 00:12:58,564
But, unless things improve,

180
00:12:58,738 --> 00:13:02,777
the biopic of my life will only have
the budget for a zoom out.

181
00:13:18,007 --> 00:13:20,043
I feel bad, cutting into his head.

182
00:13:20,218 --> 00:13:21,879
Why? It's just a fucking frog.

183
00:13:22,053 --> 00:13:23,918
It's still a thing, though. It had life.

184
00:13:24,097 --> 00:13:26,053
Where do you think they get the frogs?

185
00:13:26,224 --> 00:13:28,306
I don't know.
Probably a lake or a river nearby.

186
00:13:28,476 --> 00:13:30,842
They probably have a guy that does it.
I could find out.

187
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,102
- I don't actually want to know.
- Neither do I.

188
00:13:33,273 --> 00:13:35,889
- I'm just saying. You asked...
- I wonder where Fat is.

189
00:13:36,067 --> 00:13:37,147
- Zoe?
- Mm.

190
00:13:37,318 --> 00:13:40,276
- She hasn't been in school for a while.
- I hadn't noticed.

191
00:13:40,446 --> 00:13:42,528
I thought you would have.
She leaves a big gap.

192
00:13:42,699 --> 00:13:44,064
She's not on my radar.

193
00:13:44,242 --> 00:13:46,904
- Is it cos we pushed her into the pond?
- I didn't push her.

194
00:13:47,078 --> 00:13:50,411
- Think she's weeping herself to death?
- I didn't push her.

195
00:13:50,581 --> 00:13:52,196
Maybe you should write to her.

196
00:13:53,084 --> 00:13:55,416
Maybe you should write her
a pamphlet or something.

197
00:13:55,586 --> 00:13:57,076
What do you think?

198
00:13:57,797 --> 00:13:59,253
What is this?

199
00:13:59,966 --> 00:14:01,422
What do you want from me?

200
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:05,176
Meet me under the railway bridge after
school and we'll take it from there.

201
00:14:07,432 --> 00:14:09,798
Bring a Polaroid camera and a diary.

202
00:14:10,643 --> 00:14:12,099
OK?

203
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,327
- Got the camera and the diary?
- Do you have the pamphlet?

204
00:14:32,498 --> 00:14:34,614
Give me the camera.

205
00:14:41,132 --> 00:14:43,123
OK.

206
00:14:47,513 --> 00:14:48,969
Now kneel down.

207
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:51,973
Please, Jordana... What is this?

208
00:14:52,143 --> 00:14:54,350
Kneel down.

209
00:15:00,485 --> 00:15:01,975
Close your eyes.

210
00:15:20,171 --> 00:15:22,332
We kissed until our lips felt swollen.

211
00:15:22,507 --> 00:15:26,170
Her mouth tasted of milk, Polo mints
and Dunhill International.

212
00:15:37,188 --> 00:15:40,851
OK. Now take out the diary
and write today's date.

213
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:50,031
Write a few paragraphs on how excited
you are to have kissed me.

214
00:15:50,201 --> 00:15:53,693
Mention what a dick Mark Pritchard is
and slag off Abby Sluts.

215
00:15:53,871 --> 00:15:56,453
- It's Smuts.
- Let's call her Sluts.

216
00:15:56,624 --> 00:15:59,366
I sit next to her in Geography,
so we're mates.

217
00:15:59,544 --> 00:16:01,500
I don't need your life story.

218
00:16:04,549 --> 00:16:07,712
Wow. You look mentally retarded.

219
00:16:07,885 --> 00:16:09,625
Have you ever kissed anyone before?

220
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:14,547
I had in fact only kissed
one person before - Zoe Preece.

221
00:16:14,725 --> 00:16:17,842
It was after the Cowboys And Indians
school disco.

222
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:21,057
I told her if we were going to do it,
we had to hide behind the refectory.

223
00:16:21,232 --> 00:16:23,393
Her tongue was blue
from blackcurrant squash.

224
00:16:23,568 --> 00:16:25,433
It smouldered in the cold.

225
00:16:26,404 --> 00:16:27,894
OK, I've done it.

226
00:16:33,953 --> 00:16:34,988
Good.

227
00:16:35,163 --> 00:16:37,028
- Can I have the pamphlet now?
- No.

228
00:16:37,206 --> 00:16:40,573
- What will you do with the photos?
- Leave them lying around school.

229
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:42,582
For people to accidentally find.

230
00:16:42,753 --> 00:16:44,118
Oh.

231
00:16:44,297 --> 00:16:45,833
What are you complaining about?

232
00:16:46,007 --> 00:16:48,714
This is conclusive proof
that you might not be gay.

233
00:16:48,885 --> 00:16:51,843
Gaylord! Gaylord! Gaylord! Gaylord!

234
00:16:52,013 --> 00:16:55,096
Gaylord! Gaylord! Gaylord! Gaylord!

235
00:16:57,268 --> 00:16:59,884
Come on, gay boy, take back
what you said about me!

236
00:17:00,062 --> 00:17:01,723
I take it back. I take it back.

237
00:17:01,898 --> 00:17:04,605
And admit that you're in fact a gaylord.

238
00:17:06,861 --> 00:17:08,817
No. Do not admit it.

239
00:17:08,988 --> 00:17:11,400
- Do not admit that.
- Shut up, Chips.

240
00:17:11,574 --> 00:17:13,610
Fine. I'm gay, I'm very gay.

241
00:17:16,996 --> 00:17:18,702
And Jordana's a slut.

242
00:17:20,082 --> 00:17:21,447
- Jordana is a slut.
- No.

243
00:17:21,626 --> 00:17:23,116
Say it. Say it!

244
00:17:23,294 --> 00:17:24,909
No.

245
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:27,954
Don't be a dick, Mark. Just let him go.

246
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:33,126
Fine. I'll let him go.

247
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,045
I'll let him go.

248
00:17:36,224 --> 00:17:39,091
If... he admits you're a slut.

249
00:17:39,268 --> 00:17:41,133
- Ooh.
- Just say it, gay boy.

250
00:17:41,312 --> 00:17:43,177
Say it.

251
00:17:54,492 --> 00:17:58,610
Why don't you go fuck yourself?
Fucking big gay.

252
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:03,827
I was completely overbalanced.

253
00:18:04,001 --> 00:18:07,619
It was luck, I'm gonna get him for this.
I'll bring him so much pain.

254
00:18:07,797 --> 00:18:10,163
Probably catch him like he caught me,
on the sly.

255
00:18:11,884 --> 00:18:13,795
Blood.

256
00:18:16,055 --> 00:18:18,842
- Are you gonna get up now?
- Yeah. Sorry, yeah.

257
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,282
- You've got scaly hands.
- It's eczema.

258
00:19:18,868 --> 00:19:21,359
Now that we had kissed
for non-blackmail purposes,

259
00:19:21,537 --> 00:19:24,529
I thought it gentlemanly
to escort Jordana home.

260
00:19:24,707 --> 00:19:28,074
When there, I asked if
she was my girlfriend now. And she said:

261
00:19:28,252 --> 00:19:30,243
I'll think about it.

262
00:19:32,214 --> 00:19:34,205
But what she meant was, yes.

263
00:19:34,925 --> 00:19:36,916
We are now as one.

264
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,651
Whenever I'm late home from school,

265
00:19:56,822 --> 00:20:00,030
my mother assumes I've been abducted
and left to drown in a lake.

266
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,651
There he is. Oliver?

267
00:20:03,412 --> 00:20:05,698
My mother is worried
that I have mental problems.

268
00:20:05,873 --> 00:20:08,285
I found a book about
teenage paranoid delusions

269
00:20:08,459 --> 00:20:11,041
during a routine search
of my parents' bedroom.

270
00:20:11,212 --> 00:20:14,420
After that, I started slipping
choice phrases into our conversation.

271
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:17,502
My body has been replaced by a shell.
My organs are made of stone.

272
00:20:17,677 --> 00:20:19,508
- I've been dead for years.
- Right.

273
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,612
My mother is naturally neurotic

274
00:20:21,801 --> 00:20:23,988
and in her youth even dreamed
of being an actress.

275
00:20:24,058 --> 00:20:28,051
Until she was told by a speech therapist
her tongue was too big for her mouth.

276
00:20:28,229 --> 00:20:32,518
Now she works for the council's Legal
and Democratic Services department.

277
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,356
One of the rules in her office

278
00:20:38,531 --> 00:20:40,522
- is that if it's your birthday...
- Ta-da.

279
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,316
.. you are held responsible
for bringing your own cake to work.

280
00:20:43,494 --> 00:20:45,530
- Happy birthday, Jill.
- Thank you.

281
00:20:47,456 --> 00:20:48,741
Oliver?

282
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,781
Oliver, come here.

283
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,496
Come here.

284
00:20:53,337 --> 00:20:55,328
Where are you going, Oliver?

285
00:20:59,093 --> 00:21:00,879
OK, sit up.

286
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:07,765
- Are you being victimised again?
- No. I'm never victimised.

287
00:21:07,935 --> 00:21:09,550
You were, in primary school and Cubs.

288
00:21:09,729 --> 00:21:11,845
- I don't remember.
- I do. There was a lot of crying.

289
00:21:12,022 --> 00:21:13,808
- Is it drug related?
- How?

290
00:21:13,983 --> 00:21:15,848
- I don't know. You tell me.
- It's not.

291
00:21:16,026 --> 00:21:17,891
- Your pupils are huge.
- It's dark.

292
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:20,857
- Is it self-harm?
- Why would I punch myself in the eye?

293
00:21:21,031 --> 00:21:23,773
- I really don't know.
- I wouldn't. This is stupid.

294
00:21:23,951 --> 00:21:26,818
I'm not going anywhere
until you tell me the truth.

295
00:21:28,748 --> 00:21:30,613
OK, I got into a fight.

296
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:33,203
I was defending the honour
of my girlfriend.

297
00:21:33,377 --> 00:21:34,833
OK, fine.

298
00:21:35,004 --> 00:21:36,960
You're not being serious, it's fine.

299
00:21:37,131 --> 00:21:38,996
No, I am. I have a girlfriend now.

300
00:21:39,175 --> 00:21:41,040
- Really?
- Yeah.

301
00:21:41,218 --> 00:21:42,628
- Do you?
- Yeah.

302
00:21:42,803 --> 00:21:44,259
- Really?
- Yeah.

303
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:46,295
Of course.

304
00:21:46,474 --> 00:21:48,806
Yes, of course. I mean,
why wouldn't... I didn't...

305
00:21:48,976 --> 00:21:51,888
- Did you think I was...
- No, I didn't. Come here.

306
00:21:58,611 --> 00:22:01,318
What a lovely little chat.
You're doing so well.

307
00:22:19,298 --> 00:22:20,253
So?

308
00:22:20,424 --> 00:22:22,289
K-nock, k-nock, can I come in?

309
00:22:22,468 --> 00:22:24,959
This was the happiest
I'd seen my father for years.

310
00:22:26,096 --> 00:22:29,338
Not too long ago, I discovered
an empty bottle of anti-depressants,

311
00:22:29,517 --> 00:22:32,133
during another routine search
of my parents' bedroom.

312
00:22:32,311 --> 00:22:35,348
My research indicates it all started
when he was sacked from his job

313
00:22:35,523 --> 00:22:37,434
presenting on the Open University.

314
00:22:37,608 --> 00:22:39,473
My father is a marine biologist,

315
00:22:39,652 --> 00:22:42,610
and introduced a segment
called Mysteries Of The Deep.

316
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,645
But he was an uneasy screen presence

317
00:22:44,824 --> 00:22:47,406
and never knew quite what to do
with his hands.

318
00:22:49,411 --> 00:22:51,823
After his dismissal,
he spent several days in bed,

319
00:22:51,997 --> 00:22:54,830
drinking hot lemon from the same mug
and never washing it,

320
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,956
a key sign of one of his downturns.

321
00:22:57,127 --> 00:22:59,209
Now he works at the local university,

322
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,336
doing a job he finds
difficult to explain

323
00:23:01,507 --> 00:23:04,499
to anyone without
a degree-level knowledge of fish.

324
00:23:08,389 --> 00:23:10,254
Listen, I hope you don't mind.

325
00:23:10,432 --> 00:23:13,344
But your mother informs me
that you have a girlfriend.

326
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:15,851
Is there anything
I can help you with there?

327
00:23:16,021 --> 00:23:17,761
I'm not sure yet. I'll let you know.

328
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,521
OK. All right.

329
00:23:19,692 --> 00:23:21,523
Yes. Er... listen...

330
00:23:21,694 --> 00:23:24,185
I know you think I'm very boring,
you know.

331
00:23:25,281 --> 00:23:29,650
But once... I ripped my vest off
in front of a woman

332
00:23:30,411 --> 00:23:33,073
and er... it was very effective,
actually.

333
00:23:33,247 --> 00:23:34,202
I know.

334
00:23:34,373 --> 00:23:36,705
It produced a very atavistic response.

335
00:23:36,876 --> 00:23:39,037
That's just something to bear in mind.

336
00:23:40,546 --> 00:23:44,334
And listen,
I made you a cassette recording.

337
00:23:44,967 --> 00:23:47,756
It's a compilation of songs
I used to listen to

338
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:50,382
during some
of my early formative relationships.

339
00:23:50,556 --> 00:23:52,717
Plus a couple of things
I thought you might dig.

340
00:23:52,892 --> 00:23:56,225
I think music can make things seem
a bit more real, sometimes,

341
00:23:56,395 --> 00:23:58,181
- if you know what I mean.
- Thanks.

342
00:23:58,355 --> 00:24:02,292
I've also included some break-up songs
towards the end,

343
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:04,769
just in case things don't work out.

344
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,280
Which, obviously, you know,
that isn't the aim,

345
00:24:07,458 --> 00:24:09,713
though, I'm gonna tell you,
it is likely.

346
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,191
Passion rarely lasts, I'm afraid.

347
00:24:12,786 --> 00:24:14,651
All right, well...

348
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:17,663
good night and erm... well done!

349
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:20,540
It's an achievement.
It really is, of sorts.

350
00:24:20,711 --> 00:24:21,791
Good night, son.

351
00:24:40,773 --> 00:24:43,606
# Tomorrow I'll be quicker

352
00:24:44,443 --> 00:24:47,480
# I'll stare
into the strobe light flicker

353
00:24:47,655 --> 00:24:50,567
# And afloat I'll stay

354
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:57,620
# But I'm quite all right hiding today

355
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:02,912
# Tomorrow I'll be faster

356
00:25:03,379 --> 00:25:06,621
# I'll catch what
I've been chasing after

357
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,791
# And have time to play

358
00:25:11,845 --> 00:25:16,805
# But I'm quite all right hiding today

359
00:25:19,436 --> 00:25:23,805
# And I will play the coconut shy

360
00:25:25,943 --> 00:25:28,810
# And win a prize even if it's rigged

361
00:25:28,988 --> 00:25:31,650
# I won't know when to stop

362
00:25:31,824 --> 00:25:33,985
# And you can leave off my lid

363
00:25:34,785 --> 00:25:38,152
# And I won't even lose my fizz

364
00:25:38,789 --> 00:25:42,782
# I'll be the polka dots type

365
00:25:43,836 --> 00:25:48,671
# I'll know the way back
if you know the way

366
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:55,549
# But if you are, I am quite all right

367
00:25:56,682 --> 00:26:00,174
# Hiding today

368
00:26:01,186 --> 00:26:04,519
Jordana and I enjoyed a glorious
atavistic fortnight of lovemaking,

369
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:06,931
humiliating teachers
and bullying the weak.

370
00:26:07,109 --> 00:26:10,601
I've already turned these moments
into the Super-8 footage of memory.

371
00:26:16,785 --> 00:26:19,697
# Tomorrow I'll be stronger

372
00:26:20,581 --> 00:26:22,367
# Running colourful

373
00:26:22,541 --> 00:26:26,375
# No longer just in black and white

374
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:33,583
# And quite all right hiding tonight

375
00:26:35,262 --> 00:26:40,632
# And I will have a game
on the coconut shy

376
00:26:42,603 --> 00:26:45,891
# And win a prize even if it's rigged

377
00:26:46,065 --> 00:26:50,729
# I won't know when to stop
and you can leave off my lid

378
00:26:50,903 --> 00:26:54,896
# And I won't even lose my fizz

379
00:26:55,282 --> 00:26:59,821
# I'll be the polka dots type

380
00:27:00,662 --> 00:27:05,531
# I'll probably swim through
a few lagoons

381
00:27:05,709 --> 00:27:07,574
# I'll have a spring in my step

382
00:27:07,753 --> 00:27:10,540
# And I'll get there soon

383
00:27:10,714 --> 00:27:13,877
# To sing you a happy tune

384
00:27:15,385 --> 00:27:17,250
# Tomorrow

385
00:27:17,429 --> 00:27:19,920
# And you'd better bring a change
of clothes

386
00:27:20,599 --> 00:27:25,969
# So we can sail our laughing pianos

387
00:27:27,106 --> 00:27:30,769
# Along a beam of light

388
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:40,112
# But I'm quite all right hiding tonight

389
00:27:45,541 --> 00:27:47,782
It's fucking ridiculous!
How long's it been?

390
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,621
Two weeks. It's fucking ridiculous!

391
00:27:49,795 --> 00:27:51,786
I'm not bothered.
We've as good as done it.

392
00:27:51,964 --> 00:27:54,956
Never take more than a week between
everything but and stuffing it in.

393
00:27:55,134 --> 00:27:56,965
She's taking the piss.
Keiron, back me up.

394
00:27:57,136 --> 00:27:59,047
- She's taking the piss, man.
- Thank you.

395
00:27:59,221 --> 00:28:01,212
Watch out, she's looking.

396
00:28:04,518 --> 00:28:06,383
Is she still looking?

397
00:28:06,562 --> 00:28:08,143
Yep.

398
00:28:09,356 --> 00:28:12,348
Jordana hates any place
that could be termed romantic.

399
00:28:12,526 --> 00:28:15,768
With this in mind, I took her to
one of my favourite industrial estates,

400
00:28:15,946 --> 00:28:17,937
for some quality one-on-one time.

401
00:28:26,999 --> 00:28:28,990
This is nice, isn't it?

402
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,325
Yeah, it's not bad.

403
00:28:32,504 --> 00:28:35,166
I mean, you know, we get on pretty well.

404
00:28:36,175 --> 00:28:38,166
JORDANA:

405
00:28:39,344 --> 00:28:41,630
And we're getting more
and more intimate.

406
00:28:41,805 --> 00:28:42,840
Intimate?

407
00:28:43,015 --> 00:28:46,178
Yeah, you know, we've done things.
We've been intimate.

408
00:28:47,186 --> 00:28:49,177
We have been intimate, yeah.

409
00:28:52,024 --> 00:28:54,436
My parents are going to the cinema
on Thursday,

410
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:57,352
It's a tradition.
They go every Thursday evening.

411
00:28:57,529 --> 00:28:59,520
So what I'm saying is, it's empty.

412
00:29:00,365 --> 00:29:02,697
The house. On Thursday.
The house is empty.

413
00:29:02,868 --> 00:29:05,109
On Thursday evening,
it's an empty house.

414
00:29:05,287 --> 00:29:07,152
So what do you think?

415
00:29:07,331 --> 00:29:10,118
Are you asking me to come round
and have sex with you?

416
00:29:10,292 --> 00:29:13,455
If I say yes, does that lessen
the chance of you wanting to?

417
00:29:13,629 --> 00:29:16,416
Before I answer that,
I just want to check one thing.

418
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:19,047
- Yeah, sure. What is it?
- It's quite serious.

419
00:29:19,218 --> 00:29:23,211
Of course, yeah. Go ahead, you should
be able to ask what you want to ask.

420
00:29:24,223 --> 00:29:25,884
Will the house be empty?

421
00:29:30,729 --> 00:29:32,720
Write down the reasons why I should.

422
00:29:46,912 --> 00:29:47,901
OK.

423
00:29:51,041 --> 00:29:53,908
It's Thursday. You're going to
the cinema? You should leave.

424
00:29:54,086 --> 00:29:55,917
Is that what you wear to lounge around?

425
00:29:56,088 --> 00:29:58,249
Your father doesn't want to go out
all of a sudden.

426
00:29:58,423 --> 00:30:01,506
I've been looking forward to it.
I didn't realise there'd be others.

427
00:30:01,677 --> 00:30:04,089
- They're our neighbours.
- Who, the ninjas?

428
00:30:04,263 --> 00:30:06,845
It's Thursday, our cinema night.
It's not a free-for-all.

429
00:30:07,015 --> 00:30:09,597
Do not call them ninjas, Oliver.
It's racist.

430
00:30:09,768 --> 00:30:10,928
He's white.

431
00:30:11,103 --> 00:30:13,264
They don't strike me
as big Eric Rohmer fans.

432
00:30:13,438 --> 00:30:16,601
Why don't the three of you just go
and see some tat at the Odeon?

433
00:30:16,775 --> 00:30:18,515
- I'll just stay in.
- You should both go.

434
00:30:18,694 --> 00:30:20,685
So rude, Lloyd.

435
00:30:23,282 --> 00:30:25,273
Oh, for God's sake.

436
00:30:35,168 --> 00:30:37,033
- Oh, Graham.
- Whoa!

437
00:30:37,212 --> 00:30:39,123
- Oh, not really...
- Hey.

438
00:30:39,298 --> 00:30:41,129
Oh, thanks.

439
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,291
Are you all right?

440
00:30:44,344 --> 00:30:45,800
Whoargh!

441
00:30:45,971 --> 00:30:47,211
You look lovely.

442
00:30:47,389 --> 00:30:49,801
- Thank you very much.
- Sorry I'm a bit early.

443
00:30:49,975 --> 00:30:53,638
It's just, there's a fantastic
noodle bar right next to the cinema.

444
00:30:53,812 --> 00:30:56,144
Kim-Lin and I would love to take
you and Lloyd,..

445
00:30:56,315 --> 00:30:58,146
- Ninjas.
- My treat.

446
00:30:58,317 --> 00:31:00,808
- Very sweet.
- No need to take two cars, right?

447
00:31:00,986 --> 00:31:02,476
Plenty of room in the van.

448
00:31:02,654 --> 00:31:05,145
Do you mind jumping in the back,
here, Lloyd?

449
00:31:07,993 --> 00:31:10,735
Hop right in there,
make yourself comfortable.

450
00:31:12,289 --> 00:31:14,280
All right there, buddy? Great.

451
00:32:29,282 --> 00:32:31,273
Thanks for living up a fucking hill.

452
00:32:33,453 --> 00:32:36,365
Sorry, I had to er... go to the toilet.

453
00:32:37,082 --> 00:32:39,073
I'm OK now. It doesn't matter.

454
00:32:40,252 --> 00:32:42,664
Just gonna top this up quickly.

455
00:32:43,505 --> 00:32:45,496
There we go.

456
00:32:47,092 --> 00:32:49,674
To us, and a wonderful evening
of lovemaking.

457
00:32:53,265 --> 00:32:54,880
Can you just get off my shoulders?

458
00:32:55,058 --> 00:32:57,049
I'm just directing you, just...

459
00:32:58,103 --> 00:33:01,721
Right, OK, just don't open them.
I'll tell you when. Stay there.

460
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,311
- What, now?
- Yeah.

461
00:33:10,323 --> 00:33:12,439
Fucking hell, you're a serial killer.

462
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:16,368
I'm sorry for that.
I didn't know whether you'd like it.

463
00:33:16,538 --> 00:33:18,824
But we can learn from it.
I've learned from it.

464
00:33:18,999 --> 00:33:22,162
I think you've learned from it.
Maybe we could start again.

465
00:33:22,335 --> 00:33:25,122
- I've gotta go home.
- OK, cool. You should go home.

466
00:33:25,297 --> 00:33:29,381
I'll give you this. It's just a letter
I was gonna give you. Just take it.

467
00:33:29,551 --> 00:33:31,542
It's nothing.

468
00:33:32,637 --> 00:33:34,548
- Sorry, but...
- No, no, I... Yeah...

469
00:33:34,723 --> 00:33:36,714
- You...
- OK, bye.

470
00:33:51,364 --> 00:33:54,356
Dear Jordana, thank you for letting me
explore your perfect body.

471
00:33:54,534 --> 00:33:55,649
I could drink your blood.

472
00:33:55,827 --> 00:33:58,990
You're the only person I would allow
to be shrunk to microscopic size

473
00:33:59,164 --> 00:34:01,405
and swim inside me
in a tiny submersible machine.

474
00:34:01,583 --> 00:34:04,325
We've lost our virginity
but it wasn't like losing anything.

475
00:34:04,503 --> 00:34:08,667
You're too good for me. You're too good
for anyone. Sincerely, Oliver.

476
00:34:53,093 --> 00:34:55,084
Don't get cocky.

477
00:35:09,526 --> 00:35:11,187
How was the film?

478
00:35:11,361 --> 00:35:12,692
I'm going to bed.

479
00:35:12,862 --> 00:35:15,399
It's nice to see something lightweight
once in a while,

480
00:35:15,574 --> 00:35:17,030
that you don't have to think about.

481
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,031
Relationships are tough, aren't they?

482
00:35:19,744 --> 00:35:21,735
You should be in bed, Oliver.

483
00:35:25,834 --> 00:35:29,247
Tonight, I stumbled across
an encyclopaedia entry on ultrasound.

484
00:35:29,421 --> 00:35:33,209
Ultrasound is a sound vibration
too high frequency to be audible.

485
00:35:33,383 --> 00:35:36,125
It was first developed to locate
submerged objects -

486
00:35:36,303 --> 00:35:40,091
submarines, depth charges,
Atlantis and such.

487
00:35:40,265 --> 00:35:42,221
Some animals, like bats,
dolphins and dogs

488
00:35:42,392 --> 00:35:44,724
can hear within the
ultrasonic frequency.

489
00:35:44,894 --> 00:35:46,885
But no human can.

490
00:35:47,063 --> 00:35:49,725
No-one can truly know
what anyone thinks or feels.

491
00:35:49,899 --> 00:35:51,890
What's inside Mum?

492
00:35:52,611 --> 00:35:53,976
What's inside Dad?

493
00:35:55,238 --> 00:35:56,899
What's inside Jordana?

494
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:01,487
We're all travelling under the radar,
undetected.

495
00:36:01,661 --> 00:36:03,652
And no-one can do a thing about it.

496
00:36:04,205 --> 00:36:07,288
- Any more word from Graham?
- Nothing to report, Jackie.

497
00:36:07,459 --> 00:36:10,121
- We went to the cinema as normal.
- How did that go?

498
00:36:10,295 --> 00:36:11,535
Awkward, of course.

499
00:36:11,713 --> 00:36:14,295
Lloyd sulked
because we watched Crocodile Dundee

500
00:36:14,466 --> 00:36:17,128
rather than one of his dark numbers,
I don't know.

501
00:36:17,302 --> 00:36:20,169
But I really laughed.
I thought it was very charming.

502
00:36:20,347 --> 00:36:23,931
And I could see why someone like her
would go for someone like him.

503
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:27,558
Graham is still very attractive.
He probably felt threatened.

504
00:36:27,729 --> 00:36:30,687
Lloyd is far too self-involved
to feel threatened, Jackie.

505
00:36:30,857 --> 00:36:32,722
He knows Graham was your first love...

506
00:36:32,901 --> 00:36:34,766
- He wasn't my first love.
- Come on.

507
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:36,309
- I was 18.
- Pardon?

508
00:36:36,488 --> 00:36:38,854
18. Look, I've got to go.
I'll call you back.

509
00:36:39,032 --> 00:36:41,114
Actually, I'll see you tomorrow, OK.

510
00:36:43,495 --> 00:36:45,110
Lloyd?

511
00:36:45,955 --> 00:36:47,820
Were you listening in to that?

512
00:36:47,999 --> 00:36:49,864
Sorry, what?

513
00:36:50,043 --> 00:36:52,329
I could hear you breathe, Lloyd.

514
00:36:58,426 --> 00:37:01,509
Why hadn't my parents told me
that Graham was Mum's first love?

515
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,968
No wonder their cinema outing
had ended in such a schism.

516
00:37:05,141 --> 00:37:07,883
I can only assume the subject
of wife-swapping was raised

517
00:37:08,061 --> 00:37:09,972
and Dad didn't feel emotionally ready.

518
00:37:10,897 --> 00:37:13,183
Is it possible that
Mum would cheat on Dad?

519
00:37:13,983 --> 00:37:15,268
Will they get divorced?

520
00:37:15,443 --> 00:37:16,649
They don't even row.

521
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,811
They just have discussions.

522
00:37:19,989 --> 00:37:22,651
I'm going to have to
increase my surveillance.

523
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:53,721
Good night, Oliver.

524
00:38:44,949 --> 00:38:46,940
Yargh, yargh, yargh!

525
00:38:48,286 --> 00:38:50,277
Yargh, yargh, yargh!

526
00:38:50,747 --> 00:38:51,987
Yargh!

527
00:39:07,138 --> 00:39:09,129
Thank you very much, Jeff.

528
00:39:09,933 --> 00:39:12,766
I got you these books.
They're really meaningful to me.

529
00:39:12,936 --> 00:39:16,053
This is Shakespeare's most mature work,
miles better than Hamlet.

530
00:39:16,231 --> 00:39:17,937
Just more developed thematically.

531
00:39:18,107 --> 00:39:21,816
And this is Nietzsche, one of the most
influential philosophers of modern time.

532
00:39:21,986 --> 00:39:24,978
I don't agree with all he says
but he makes some interesting points.

533
00:39:25,156 --> 00:39:28,740
And this is The Catcher In The Rye,
a great modern American novel.

534
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:30,775
Salinger's very influential.

535
00:39:30,954 --> 00:39:32,410
Why are you doing this?

536
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:36,118
I thought it'd be nice to get some
mutual interest, now we've had sex,

537
00:39:36,292 --> 00:39:38,578
other than spitting
and setting things on fire.

538
00:39:38,753 --> 00:39:40,618
Why would I want to be more like you?

539
00:39:40,797 --> 00:39:42,958
Just try not to crack the spines
or burn them.

540
00:39:43,132 --> 00:39:46,624
We should get in. It starts in an hour.
I want to get a good seat.

541
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:51,421
It's rude to leave a film
before it's finished.

542
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:52,839
- Who to?
- The film-makers.

543
00:39:53,017 --> 00:39:54,382
- How do they know?
- They just do.

544
00:39:54,561 --> 00:39:56,176
- How?
- They do.

545
00:39:56,354 --> 00:39:59,471
- There wasn't even any sound on it.
- There was never intended to be.

546
00:39:59,649 --> 00:40:01,765
- Then why did they write it?
- Kiss me.

547
00:40:02,652 --> 00:40:04,233
Get off me!

548
00:40:04,988 --> 00:40:07,354
- What are you doing?
- Just kiss me.

549
00:40:07,532 --> 00:40:09,739
Get the fuck off me, you freak.

550
00:40:14,831 --> 00:40:16,662
That was fucking ridiculous.

551
00:40:16,833 --> 00:40:18,243
"Kiss me!" Who says that?

552
00:40:18,418 --> 00:40:21,080
- It was a kiss. I tried to be romantic.
- What the fuck?

553
00:40:21,254 --> 00:40:23,711
- You were crushing my face.
- Yeah, in a romantic way.

554
00:40:23,882 --> 00:40:25,338
I'm not in the mood.

555
00:40:27,343 --> 00:40:30,085
It seems pretty clear
that Mum is having an affair.

556
00:40:30,263 --> 00:40:33,630
Why else would she be at the
hairdresser's with Graham the ninja?

557
00:40:33,808 --> 00:40:36,390
He probably makes sure
all his prospective sex partners

558
00:40:36,561 --> 00:40:39,769
are salon fresh before impregnating
them with a ninja love child.

559
00:40:39,939 --> 00:40:40,644
Cheers.

560
00:40:40,815 --> 00:40:44,273
Mum normally just gets a trim
from her work colleague Jackie.

561
00:40:44,861 --> 00:40:48,024
But now I think of it,
she did mention her hair the other day.

562
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:50,855
I used to have long hair like her.

563
00:40:51,034 --> 00:40:51,864
Hm?

564
00:40:52,035 --> 00:40:53,900
I used to have long hair, remember?

565
00:40:54,078 --> 00:40:55,943
Hm, yes.

566
00:40:56,122 --> 00:40:59,080
- Pretty, isn't she?
- I dunno.

567
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:01,241
Do you like my hair long?

568
00:41:01,878 --> 00:41:03,869
- Er...
- Or short like now?

569
00:41:05,006 --> 00:41:08,419
Well, you know... I like your hair
no matter how long it is.

570
00:41:08,593 --> 00:41:10,254
But did you prefer it long?

571
00:41:10,428 --> 00:41:11,793
Either way's good.

572
00:41:11,971 --> 00:41:13,256
No opinion.

573
00:41:13,431 --> 00:41:15,296
Well, it's up to you.

574
00:41:15,475 --> 00:41:18,012
So it wouldn't bother you
if I shaved it all off?

575
00:41:18,186 --> 00:41:19,551
Not if it made you happy.

576
00:41:19,729 --> 00:41:21,765
If you want to shave off your hair,
you should.

577
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:25,057
Why would I shave my hair off, Lloyd?
What a stupid idea.

578
00:41:26,819 --> 00:41:28,150
Yeah.

579
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,738
I can imagine my mum calmly leaving
one day while Dad helps her pack.

580
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:36,275
So er... got any plans?

581
00:41:36,454 --> 00:41:38,319
No, not really.

582
00:41:38,498 --> 00:41:40,363
No, just...

583
00:41:40,541 --> 00:41:42,532
see how it goes, really.

584
00:42:15,201 --> 00:42:17,567
Are you planning
on getting dressed today?

585
00:42:17,745 --> 00:42:20,202
- Do you want to take the car?
- That's fine.

586
00:42:20,373 --> 00:42:23,957
I'm going to work from home today
so if you want to take the car...

587
00:42:25,753 --> 00:42:28,540
I was planning on going to see
one of Graham's talks tonight.

588
00:42:28,715 --> 00:42:30,080
- OK.
- You don't mind?

589
00:42:30,258 --> 00:42:33,000
- Why would I mind?
- It just means I won't be in tonight.

590
00:42:33,177 --> 00:42:36,044
- I'll make sure I keep myself busy.
- Oliver, you coming?

591
00:42:36,222 --> 00:42:38,588
- I'd like a moment with my father.
- Lovely.

592
00:42:38,766 --> 00:42:40,757
I'll see you in the car.

593
00:42:45,606 --> 00:42:47,562
I think Mum might be having an affair.

594
00:42:47,734 --> 00:42:49,725
Can you turn the tap off, please?

595
00:42:51,195 --> 00:42:54,528
I saw her in town with Graham and heard
her on the phone talking about him.

596
00:42:54,699 --> 00:42:56,360
You shouldn't be spying on people.

597
00:42:56,534 --> 00:42:59,822
I just saw them and accidentally
picked up the phone. Aren't you worried?

598
00:42:59,996 --> 00:43:02,328
- Graham's an old friend of Mum's.
- They've met up.

599
00:43:02,498 --> 00:43:04,329
- Yes.
- So you're condoning this affair?

600
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:07,833
There is no affair. He's just
some bloke I stole your mother from.

601
00:43:08,004 --> 00:43:10,290
So you admit they have a history?

602
00:43:10,465 --> 00:43:12,922
I think you should
go to your mother now, OK?

603
00:43:18,473 --> 00:43:20,429
- Thanks, Mum.
- Just a second, we're early.

604
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:23,883
- How are things with Jordana?
- Fine.

605
00:43:24,062 --> 00:43:26,150
- You ever going to let us meet her?
- I Don't think so.

606
00:43:26,271 --> 00:43:27,801
Maybe if you get a terminal illness.

607
00:43:28,024 --> 00:43:30,015
So things are serious between you two?

608
00:43:30,193 --> 00:43:32,177
It may seem like a big deal now

609
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:34,154
but it probably won't matter
when you're my age.

610
00:43:34,246 --> 00:43:36,051
- What? 38?
- Just be careful.

611
00:43:36,162 --> 00:43:38,064
- I always use condoms.
- Good.

612
00:43:38,242 --> 00:43:41,826
You know that your dad and I
are going through a bit of a tough time.

613
00:43:41,996 --> 00:43:45,329
And I want you to know
we really appreciate you trying to help.

614
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:48,242
- I'm not trying to help.
- You're a loud whisperer.

615
00:43:48,419 --> 00:43:50,284
You shouldn't spy on people.

616
00:43:50,463 --> 00:43:52,328
Why have you been meeting Graham?

617
00:43:52,507 --> 00:43:56,466
Graham is an old friend and has had
relationship problems with Kim-Lin.

618
00:43:56,636 --> 00:43:58,501
He needed someone he could talk to.

619
00:43:58,679 --> 00:44:01,386
- So he might be single soon?
- Goodbye, Oliver.

620
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:07,305
- Mum?
- Yes?

621
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:08,890
Who would you save first in a fire,

622
00:44:09,065 --> 00:44:12,603
given the hypothetical situation that
Dad and I were equally hard to save?

623
00:44:13,236 --> 00:44:15,693
I'd go for you but I'd feel bad
for your father.

624
00:44:15,863 --> 00:44:17,728
OK.

625
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,745
- Kiss me!
- What?

626
00:44:35,925 --> 00:44:38,132
I still can't believe you
fucking said it.

627
00:44:38,302 --> 00:44:41,169
I did not say it in a high-pitched...
like a little mouse.

628
00:44:41,347 --> 00:44:43,429
- You cried it.
- Come on, we're late.

629
00:44:46,602 --> 00:44:49,514
- That gap gets smaller every day.
- What are you doing tonight?

630
00:44:49,689 --> 00:44:51,350
I'm busy tonight.

631
00:44:51,524 --> 00:44:52,934
Doing what?

632
00:44:53,109 --> 00:44:54,770
As in, I've got stuff to do. Busy.

633
00:44:54,944 --> 00:44:57,651
No, you never have anything to do.
What are you doing?

634
00:44:58,698 --> 00:45:00,689
What is light?

635
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:02,940
What is light?

636
00:45:04,745 --> 00:45:07,612
How important is light?

637
00:45:09,041 --> 00:45:11,123
OK, let's think about that for a minute.

638
00:45:11,294 --> 00:45:15,628
Cos it seems very basic and banal
but it's not. It's loaded.

639
00:45:15,798 --> 00:45:17,504
It's a bloody nail bomb.

640
00:45:18,384 --> 00:45:23,174
I think light is probably
the most important gift we have

641
00:45:23,347 --> 00:45:25,212
from the universe.

642
00:45:25,391 --> 00:45:28,679
And if you asked any intelligent
bloody writer,

643
00:45:29,478 --> 00:45:32,811
like Professor Hawking or anybody
of that ilk,

644
00:45:34,192 --> 00:45:36,183
he could talk to you...

645
00:45:36,736 --> 00:45:40,570
for about, I don't know, a year...

646
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:42,901
just about bloody light!

647
00:45:43,492 --> 00:45:46,984
We don't want to be in the dark,

648
00:45:47,163 --> 00:45:48,903
being fiddled with.

649
00:45:49,081 --> 00:45:50,946
That's for sure.

650
00:45:51,125 --> 00:45:52,990
How's my dad meant to compete?

651
00:45:53,169 --> 00:45:55,034
The only time I saw him enthral a room

652
00:45:55,213 --> 00:45:58,831
was when he gave a talk about
the disappearance of a giant sturgeon.

653
00:45:59,050 --> 00:46:01,883
Sturgeons are royal fish,
since the 14th century,

654
00:46:02,053 --> 00:46:04,385
and, if caught,
they do become property of the Crown.

655
00:46:04,555 --> 00:46:07,388
So, yes, we're treating the matter
as suspicious.

656
00:46:09,644 --> 00:46:11,430
How deep is the ocean?

657
00:46:11,604 --> 00:46:15,938
Seven miles at its deepest point, but
on average, six miles as a rule of thumb.

658
00:46:16,484 --> 00:46:18,349
But no fish could live down there.

659
00:46:18,527 --> 00:46:21,894
There's no light, of course,
and the pressure is far too great.

660
00:46:22,073 --> 00:46:24,564
Any human who found themselves
at that level,

661
00:46:24,742 --> 00:46:26,607
well, they would die immediately.

662
00:46:26,786 --> 00:46:29,528
They would implode.
They wouldn't stand a chance.

663
00:46:29,705 --> 00:46:31,570
But in answer to your question,

664
00:46:31,749 --> 00:46:34,206
the ocean is six miles deep.

665
00:46:37,588 --> 00:46:39,419
I am a prism.

666
00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:41,581
That's not mad.

667
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:45,172
OK? I am a prism, I am light.

668
00:46:45,888 --> 00:46:47,879
I am lucid.

669
00:46:48,474 --> 00:46:50,715
I am exciting and delicious.

670
00:46:50,893 --> 00:46:53,179
Thanks very much for today.
You've been fantastic.

671
00:47:07,618 --> 00:47:08,778
Well done.

672
00:47:08,953 --> 00:47:11,285
- It seemed to go pretty well.
- Oh, yes, yes.

673
00:47:11,455 --> 00:47:13,320
I think they...

674
00:47:13,499 --> 00:47:15,956
- They loved it.
- Did you enjoy it?

675
00:47:16,127 --> 00:47:17,788
Absolutely.

676
00:47:18,421 --> 00:47:19,957
A lot to take in.

677
00:47:20,131 --> 00:47:21,996
- But it was silly, right?
- No, no.

678
00:47:22,174 --> 00:47:24,085
- You think I'm silly?
- No, I don't.

679
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:26,842
- It's OK.
- I don't. I don't.

680
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,671
I didn't ask for this, Jill.

681
00:47:30,474 --> 00:47:33,637
This gift, it's...
It's like a burden to me.

682
00:47:33,811 --> 00:47:34,675
Sure.

683
00:47:34,854 --> 00:47:37,220
Yeah, you must be exhausted.

684
00:47:39,942 --> 00:47:41,807
I split up with Kim-Lin.

685
00:47:41,986 --> 00:47:43,977
Oh, no. Oh, dear.

686
00:47:44,155 --> 00:47:45,941
Let her go.

687
00:47:46,115 --> 00:47:48,356
- She was young, right?
- I'm really sorry.

688
00:47:48,534 --> 00:47:51,446
- It's all good.
- Anyway, I'd better... I'd better go.

689
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:53,656
- Gonna come next week?
- Er...

690
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:56,281
- I can?
- You'd better.

691
00:47:56,459 --> 00:47:58,791
Sure, I'll check my diary.

692
00:47:58,961 --> 00:48:01,543
- Bring Lloyd.
- Um...

693
00:48:01,714 --> 00:48:03,705
OK. I don't think it's really...

694
00:48:05,343 --> 00:48:06,924
.. his cup of... I'll ask.

695
00:48:07,094 --> 00:48:08,959
If you ask him...

696
00:48:09,138 --> 00:48:11,129
he will come.

697
00:48:14,185 --> 00:48:16,050
- I'll see what I can do.
- Right,

698
00:48:16,228 --> 00:48:18,935
- Thank you again. You're very good.
- Ciao, Jill.

699
00:48:19,106 --> 00:48:21,062
- Watch yourself.
- Thank you.

700
00:48:22,401 --> 00:48:24,392
Bye-bye.

701
00:48:34,288 --> 00:48:36,279
I'm watching you.

702
00:48:39,877 --> 00:48:42,368
And by being in balance
with the colours around them,

703
00:48:42,546 --> 00:48:44,753
with a healthy colour
glow around themselves,

704
00:48:44,924 --> 00:48:46,789
they're living a fulfilled life.

705
00:48:46,967 --> 00:48:52,382
So when you're in a crisis, it doesn't
feel like the waves are crashing on you,

706
00:48:52,848 --> 00:48:56,466
it feels like you can just stand
under those waves

707
00:48:56,644 --> 00:48:58,509
and let them do their business,

708
00:48:58,687 --> 00:49:03,772
and then get a towel and bloody dry
yourself off, and go about your day.

709
00:49:03,943 --> 00:49:05,353
That's what it means.

710
00:49:06,153 --> 00:49:07,563
My mum is the exact type of person

711
00:49:07,738 --> 00:49:10,150
who is susceptible
to this mystic bullshit.

712
00:49:10,324 --> 00:49:12,064
I can picture her
telling Jackie at work

713
00:49:12,243 --> 00:49:13,403
how it's a bit over the top

714
00:49:13,577 --> 00:49:15,067
but there's something in it.

715
00:49:15,246 --> 00:49:17,111
If my dad radiated a colour,

716
00:49:17,289 --> 00:49:19,325
it'd be ochre or eggshell.

717
00:49:20,543 --> 00:49:23,501
He knows the number for the pothole
helpline off by heart.

718
00:49:23,671 --> 00:49:26,663
It's about a foot in diameter.
It's a bit of a concern.

719
00:49:27,508 --> 00:49:28,588
Pothole.

720
00:49:28,759 --> 00:49:31,546
Yes, that's right, Lloyd Tate.
Oh, hi, how are you?

721
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:35,429
He was the first person in our village
to install double glazing.

722
00:49:38,602 --> 00:49:39,682
It's from Dad.

723
00:49:39,854 --> 00:49:41,719
He ruins every Christmas.

724
00:49:41,897 --> 00:49:43,888
It's a kettle.

725
00:49:45,109 --> 00:49:45,973
Great.

726
00:49:46,152 --> 00:49:48,564
.. how extraordinary they are.

727
00:49:49,405 --> 00:49:51,396
Because they've forgotten, right?

728
00:49:52,450 --> 00:49:55,032
Maybe it's time for Dad
to rip off his vest again.

729
00:49:55,202 --> 00:49:58,444
I mean, it's a bit over the top,
but I think there's something in it.

730
00:49:58,622 --> 00:50:00,283
Yes, yes. Good turnout, was it?

731
00:50:00,458 --> 00:50:02,039
I'm going out for a bit.

732
00:50:02,793 --> 00:50:06,331
The question was, do I tell Jordana
about this Graham situation?

733
00:50:06,505 --> 00:50:08,370
I mean, we'd had sex.

734
00:50:08,549 --> 00:50:11,416
Wouldn't it spoil things
if I suddenly got emotional?

735
00:50:14,805 --> 00:50:17,672
I decided to soften the blow
with some light arson.

736
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,596
You don't talk about your parents much.

737
00:50:24,773 --> 00:50:28,686
- I mean, do they get on?
- Yeah, they get on.

738
00:50:28,861 --> 00:50:30,394
Mine get on as well.

739
00:50:30,415 --> 00:50:33,030
It's good, isn't it?
It's important that they get on.

740
00:50:33,702 --> 00:50:36,264
So everything's fine at home,
everything's OK?

741
00:50:36,390 --> 00:50:37,820
Cos everything's fine with me.

742
00:50:39,038 --> 00:50:41,120
Actually, my mum's not well
at the moment.

743
00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:42,951
They get on, you know.

744
00:50:43,125 --> 00:50:44,706
That's the main thing.

745
00:50:45,669 --> 00:50:46,829
Yeah.

746
00:50:49,089 --> 00:50:51,205
Sorry, did you say your mum wasn't well?

747
00:50:51,383 --> 00:50:52,247
Yeah.

748
00:50:53,928 --> 00:50:55,919
Why, what's wrong?

749
00:50:56,764 --> 00:50:58,629
She's got...

750
00:50:58,807 --> 00:51:01,844
it's called... medulloblastoma.

751
00:51:06,607 --> 00:51:08,268
What does it mean?

752
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:11,351
It means she's got a brain tumour.

753
00:51:15,115 --> 00:51:16,525
Oh, no.

754
00:51:20,704 --> 00:51:23,456
Confiding in Jordana was now impossible.

755
00:51:24,258 --> 00:51:25,739
Her mother had cancer.

756
00:51:25,909 --> 00:51:28,402
And in the Top Trumps
of parental problems,

757
00:51:28,526 --> 00:51:30,594
cancer beats potential infidelity.

758
00:51:31,924 --> 00:51:34,210
I would have to
travel this road secretly,

759
00:51:34,385 --> 00:51:36,046
unaided,

760
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:37,960
a renegade,

761
00:51:38,138 --> 00:51:40,049
a solitary samurai.

762
00:52:14,091 --> 00:52:16,628
Things were a lot less fun since
Jordana's mother might die

763
00:52:16,802 --> 00:52:19,464
and my parents' marriage
started falling apart.

764
00:52:19,638 --> 00:52:22,254
I've been working on strategies
to solve both problems.

765
00:52:22,433 --> 00:52:25,971
I bought my dad some new aftershave,
but I'm drawing a blank on the cancer.

766
00:52:30,983 --> 00:52:34,191
You're fucked. Even if her mum
is terminal, it can still take ages.

767
00:52:34,361 --> 00:52:35,601
Please, Chip, shut up.

768
00:52:35,779 --> 00:52:37,519
This is not what you signed up for.

769
00:52:37,698 --> 00:52:40,531
This is about dipping your wick.
You've done that, game over.

770
00:52:40,701 --> 00:52:42,783
She'll be in no mood
to put out any more.

771
00:52:42,953 --> 00:52:44,363
No more Yuletide logging for you,

772
00:52:44,538 --> 00:52:47,780
unlike me, who shall be rolling in it
throughout the festive period.

773
00:52:47,958 --> 00:52:49,914
Do you actually pre-prepare these lines?

774
00:52:50,085 --> 00:52:51,950
I just split lines as they come to me.

775
00:52:52,129 --> 00:52:54,916
You've got to shut the shit down.
Keiron, get my back.

776
00:52:55,090 --> 00:52:56,921
- With extreme prejudice.
- Thank you.

777
00:52:57,092 --> 00:53:00,300
- Nothing's changed.
- Do what you want. Remember two things:

778
00:53:00,471 --> 00:53:02,302
one - treat 'em mean, keep 'em keen.

779
00:53:02,473 --> 00:53:04,338
Two - don't mix family and bush.

780
00:53:04,516 --> 00:53:07,804
Get the fuck out of here.
Merry Christmas. Have a good 'un.

781
00:53:09,021 --> 00:53:10,306
You all right?

782
00:53:10,481 --> 00:53:13,848
You've gotta shut this shit down.
It's fucking ridiculous.

783
00:53:18,322 --> 00:53:20,313
# ALEX TURNER: Glass In The Park

784
00:53:27,414 --> 00:53:29,996
# If there's glass in the park

785
00:53:31,251 --> 00:53:35,494
# Darling, I can't help but keep

786
00:53:36,048 --> 00:53:40,087
# Making appointments to sweep

787
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:44,094
# Beneath the climbing frame

788
00:53:46,016 --> 00:53:49,679
# If the sun's in your eyes

789
00:53:50,270 --> 00:53:54,513
# I'll tighten your blindfold, baby

790
00:53:55,109 --> 00:53:59,273
# Don't worry, your foot won't get cut

791
00:53:59,446 --> 00:54:02,938
# Strut carelessly

792
00:54:04,034 --> 00:54:06,741
I've been taking my duty as a boyfriend
seriously.

793
00:54:06,912 --> 00:54:09,699
Last night, I reread the book
I Only Want What's Best For You.

794
00:54:09,873 --> 00:54:11,363
I remembered a chapter that says:

795
00:54:20,459 --> 00:54:22,303
It's therefore in Jordana's interest

796
00:54:22,315 --> 00:54:24,421
that her dog dies before her mother does.

797
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:27,045
Then we can get things back on track.

798
00:54:33,564 --> 00:54:35,395
Oliver Tate.

799
00:54:35,566 --> 00:54:37,557
OK, calm down.

800
00:54:38,736 --> 00:54:41,603
What happened?

801
00:54:42,990 --> 00:54:45,197
There was no need
to poison Jordana's dog

802
00:54:45,367 --> 00:54:47,858
because Jordana's dog
had just been hit by a train.

803
00:54:48,036 --> 00:54:50,903
I scraped his remains
into the bin liner I'd brought.

804
00:54:51,081 --> 00:54:54,573
The death of a pet makes it easier
to accept the death of a parent.

805
00:54:54,752 --> 00:54:58,415
I could feel the tension between Jordana
and I start to slip away.

806
00:55:12,436 --> 00:55:13,300
Oh!

807
00:55:13,479 --> 00:55:15,640
No, of course, I'm sorry. I just...

808
00:55:15,814 --> 00:55:17,805
I thought...

809
00:55:19,985 --> 00:55:21,976
We should bury him.

810
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:24,941
No, I don't think we should.

811
00:55:25,115 --> 00:55:27,276
Foxes dig up dead animals and eat them.

812
00:55:28,619 --> 00:55:30,610
What should we do, then?

813
00:55:33,165 --> 00:55:35,907
Well, there's this thing the Vikings
used to do.

814
00:55:44,802 --> 00:55:46,667
Jude would like to meet you.

815
00:55:46,845 --> 00:55:48,551
- Who's Jude?
- My mum.

816
00:55:48,722 --> 00:55:50,462
Since when have you called her Jude?

817
00:55:50,641 --> 00:55:52,472
Since she might die in two weeks.

818
00:55:52,643 --> 00:55:53,928
Right.

819
00:55:54,978 --> 00:55:56,969
So, do you wanna come?

820
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:05,273
The Bevans had Christmas dinner early
in case it was the last one they had.

821
00:56:05,447 --> 00:56:07,654
I hoped it wouldn't be,
cos the turkey was quite dry

822
00:56:07,825 --> 00:56:10,362
and the spouts had turned mushy
and out of focus.

823
00:56:10,536 --> 00:56:11,821
This is crackin', love.

824
00:56:11,995 --> 00:56:13,656
Yeah, it's great. Thank you, Mrs Bevan.

825
00:56:13,831 --> 00:56:16,288
This is my last warning. It's Jude.

826
00:56:16,458 --> 00:56:19,746
So, I hear from my little girl
that you've stolen her heart.

827
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:20,625
Dad...

828
00:56:20,796 --> 00:56:23,538
Let me tell you,
if you're lucky enough to find an angel,

829
00:56:26,593 --> 00:56:29,005
hold onto her
with everything you've got.

830
00:56:30,597 --> 00:56:32,588
Oh, these fucking lights!

831
00:56:35,727 --> 00:56:37,718
Cheap shit.

832
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,391
Oh, come on.

833
00:56:44,361 --> 00:56:48,070
You're acting like I'm dead already.

834
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:49,525
Come on.

835
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:51,941
It'd take more than
some silly tumour to kill me.

836
00:56:52,119 --> 00:56:54,781
- It might not.
- Oh, come on, now. Don't be daft.

837
00:56:57,416 --> 00:56:59,407
- Sorry.
- All right.

838
00:57:00,002 --> 00:57:01,993
Oh, it's all right, darling. Ssh.

839
00:57:03,589 --> 00:57:04,704
- Come here.
- Sorry, love.

840
00:57:04,882 --> 00:57:06,088
Are you all right? Come on.

841
00:57:06,258 --> 00:57:07,623
- Come on.
- Sorry, sorry.

842
00:57:07,801 --> 00:57:08,540
Sorry.

843
00:57:08,719 --> 00:57:09,754
- All right?
- Yeah.

844
00:57:09,928 --> 00:57:12,044
I'm fine. I'm fine. Give us a cudge.

845
00:57:12,890 --> 00:57:14,551
Listen... Thank you.

846
00:57:14,725 --> 00:57:16,340
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

847
00:57:16,518 --> 00:57:19,806
Thank you for looking after Jordana,
for walking through the fire with her.

848
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:21,595
- Thank you. Appreciate it.
- No.

849
00:57:21,773 --> 00:57:23,980
- No, we both do.
- He's a good boy, isn't he?

850
00:57:24,151 --> 00:57:25,641
Part of the family now. Deal?

851
00:57:25,819 --> 00:57:27,104
- Deal?
- Deal.

852
00:57:27,279 --> 00:57:28,564
Family, deal.

853
00:57:28,739 --> 00:57:29,899
Deal, yes?

854
00:57:30,073 --> 00:57:32,109
There we fucking go.

855
00:57:52,930 --> 00:57:55,797
Maybe you should come to the hospital
this Friday.

856
00:57:57,059 --> 00:58:00,017
Mum will have had her operation by then
and we can visit.

857
00:58:00,187 --> 00:58:03,600
- If you felt like it.
- Er, Friday.

858
00:58:04,358 --> 00:58:06,019
I've got to do some Christmas shopping.

859
00:58:06,193 --> 00:58:07,603
- What?
- I always leave it too late.

860
00:58:07,778 --> 00:58:10,064
- I want to get you something good.
- Mother might die.

861
00:58:10,238 --> 00:58:11,273
- I know.
- Do you care,

862
00:58:11,448 --> 00:58:13,439
- or couldn't you give a fuck?
- I do, clearly.

863
00:58:13,617 --> 00:58:15,073
I'll come. When is it?

864
00:58:15,243 --> 00:58:16,983
Friday.

865
00:58:18,664 --> 00:58:19,904
Great, yeah.

866
00:58:20,082 --> 00:58:23,870
Yeah, Friday's good for me, actually.
Yeah, I can do that. Excellent.

867
00:58:24,044 --> 00:58:26,251
Your skin's better.
You're allergic to the dog.

868
00:58:27,047 --> 00:58:28,537
I'm eating better.

869
00:58:28,715 --> 00:58:30,125
Following Mum's special diet.

870
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:32,211
Is that because of the...

871
00:58:32,386 --> 00:58:34,251
We eat lots of ginger now.

872
00:58:34,429 --> 00:58:36,420
So, Friday.

873
00:58:37,099 --> 00:58:38,760
The visiting hours are six till eight.

874
00:58:38,934 --> 00:58:41,767
Got it. Six till eight.
I'll meet you there.

875
00:58:41,937 --> 00:58:43,068
OK.

876
00:58:43,939 --> 00:58:46,006
I'm sorry I'm like this.

877
00:58:46,566 --> 00:58:49,103
- I dunno. I'm sorry.
- No, it's fine.

878
00:58:49,277 --> 00:58:50,926
Don't think you have to wait. It's cold.

879
00:58:50,927 --> 00:58:52,724
No, it's fine. I'll wait.

880
00:58:53,448 --> 00:58:55,063
I've got you these matches.

881
00:58:55,242 --> 00:58:57,233
Your favourite.

882
00:58:58,704 --> 00:59:00,285
I noticed the way you light a match.

883
00:59:00,455 --> 00:59:02,992
The flame is the same shape
as a falling tear.

884
00:59:04,001 --> 00:59:06,083
I knew then it was too late to save her.

885
00:59:06,837 --> 00:59:08,919
She'd gone gooey in the middle.

886
00:59:09,089 --> 00:59:12,126
From now on she'll buy little gifts
for her favourite teachers

887
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:15,633
and she'll admire the scenery
and she'll buy soup for homeless people.

888
00:59:16,263 --> 00:59:18,675
And she'll never burn my leg here again.

889
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:24,221
- Maybe I will go. It's pretty cold.
- Yeah.

890
00:59:24,396 --> 00:59:26,432
OK.

891
00:59:35,073 --> 00:59:37,064
Good night.

892
00:59:53,341 --> 00:59:56,708
When I discovered
I could see these colours in people,

893
00:59:56,887 --> 01:00:00,004
it took a long time because I was
in such a state of anxiety.

894
01:00:00,182 --> 01:00:04,642
It was when I started to be comfortable
with it and stopped trying to resist it,

895
01:00:04,811 --> 01:00:06,676
it started to nourish me.

896
01:00:06,855 --> 01:00:09,267
And I could relax around it
and be in it.

897
01:00:09,441 --> 01:00:13,059
Then I started to make
more of an understanding of it.

898
01:00:18,366 --> 01:00:20,652
Well, it's um...

899
01:00:20,827 --> 01:00:22,818
It's interesting.

900
01:00:24,539 --> 01:00:27,155
He's really working that third eye,
isn't he?

901
01:00:28,085 --> 01:00:30,246
It's just a metaphor, Lloyd.

902
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:32,536
Oh, no, no, no. I mean, it's good, yes.

903
01:00:33,799 --> 01:00:35,960
I like the whole colour coding thing.

904
01:00:36,134 --> 01:00:39,171
Well, I'd like to go again.

905
01:00:39,346 --> 01:00:41,337
I'd like you to be there, so...

906
01:00:43,183 --> 01:00:46,971
- You want us to go?
- Yes, I do.

907
01:00:47,729 --> 01:00:49,139
Right.

908
01:00:49,314 --> 01:00:50,895
Do I have to bring shorts?

909
01:00:51,066 --> 01:00:55,059
- It's on this Friday, so...
- Right, OK, yeah.

910
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:00,231
What, are you coming or...

911
01:01:00,951 --> 01:01:03,988
Well, I'm intrigued, yeah.

912
01:01:04,162 --> 01:01:06,323
- For sure.
- This Friday. This Friday.

913
01:01:06,498 --> 01:01:07,533
- This Friday?
- Mm-hm.

914
01:01:07,707 --> 01:01:09,572
OK, yep, yep.

915
01:01:10,752 --> 01:01:12,993
- Thank you.
- Mm.

916
01:01:13,755 --> 01:01:15,336
Don't let me down. OK?

917
01:01:15,507 --> 01:01:18,749
The most fantastical way people
experience the Graham T Purvis system

918
01:01:18,927 --> 01:01:20,167
is to come to the seminar.

919
01:01:20,345 --> 01:01:22,336
Oliver, what are you doing?

920
01:01:24,182 --> 01:01:26,389
.. have been mind-blowing.
I've seen lives change.

921
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:28,551
It's just incredible.

922
01:01:29,187 --> 01:01:35,103
I wish on a global scale
that people could get the message.

923
01:01:35,277 --> 01:01:38,110
Wouldn't it be just wonderful?

924
01:01:40,448 --> 01:01:42,109
Friday...

925
01:01:42,284 --> 01:01:44,320
I'll be OK. I'll be...

926
01:01:44,494 --> 01:01:47,236
I'll be fine, I'll be all right.

927
01:01:47,414 --> 01:01:49,279
Yeah, I'll be OK.

928
01:01:49,457 --> 01:01:51,288
Yeah.

929
01:02:27,329 --> 01:02:29,320
You should go in.

930
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:37,345
Dad, aren't you going to Graham's thing?

931
01:03:37,524 --> 01:03:40,140
- Hm?
- Graham's thing. It's Friday.

932
01:03:40,318 --> 01:03:42,104
I thought you were going out.

933
01:03:42,279 --> 01:03:44,395
Yeah, I'm meant to be at the hospital.

934
01:03:44,572 --> 01:03:47,234
Well, you should get along then,
I suppose.

935
01:03:47,409 --> 01:03:49,616
Yeah. Yeah, I will. Yeah, I should go.

936
01:03:55,750 --> 01:03:57,741
Right, I'm off out.

937
01:03:59,254 --> 01:04:01,586
I'll see you, then.

938
01:04:03,091 --> 01:04:04,456
Bye.

939
01:04:08,972 --> 01:04:11,088
Dad, who would you save first
in a house fire,

940
01:04:11,266 --> 01:04:12,676
given the hypothetical situation

941
01:04:12,851 --> 01:04:15,092
that both Mum and I
were equally difficult to save?

942
01:04:15,270 --> 01:04:16,430
I'd save your mother first,

943
01:04:16,604 --> 01:04:20,267
so we had a better chance
of working together to save you.

944
01:04:34,581 --> 01:04:36,788
Do you often feel like this?

945
01:04:36,958 --> 01:04:38,118
Like what?

946
01:04:38,293 --> 01:04:41,376
- Tired?
- Down in the dumps.

947
01:04:43,256 --> 01:04:45,417
Quite often.

948
01:04:45,592 --> 01:04:47,583
How long for?

949
01:04:48,636 --> 01:04:51,002
Since I was about your age, I suppose.

950
01:04:51,181 --> 01:04:53,172
What does it feel like?

951
01:04:55,894 --> 01:04:57,885
Like being underwater.

952
01:04:58,688 --> 01:05:01,475
Is that why you
became a marine biologist?

953
01:05:01,649 --> 01:05:03,480
Maybe, yeah.

954
01:05:03,651 --> 01:05:05,642
Have you always liked fish?

955
01:05:06,863 --> 01:05:08,854
I suppose so.

956
01:05:09,657 --> 01:05:13,070
I just sort of drifted into it, really.
No pun intended.

957
01:05:13,244 --> 01:05:15,235
And does Mum mind?

958
01:05:16,664 --> 01:05:18,404
I think she'd rather I earnt more money.

959
01:05:18,583 --> 01:05:20,448
No, you being underwater.

960
01:05:20,627 --> 01:05:21,537
Oh.

961
01:05:21,711 --> 01:05:23,247
Yeah, no.

962
01:05:23,421 --> 01:05:25,662
I'm sure she'd rather I wasn't.

963
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:28,456
It's not very pleasant.

964
01:05:29,469 --> 01:05:31,505
The ocean is six miles deep, isn't it?

965
01:05:34,015 --> 01:05:36,006
Well remembered. Yeah.

966
01:05:40,814 --> 01:05:42,520
Could be Mum.

967
01:05:42,690 --> 01:05:44,555
Or Jordana.

968
01:06:25,586 --> 01:06:27,321
I haven't spoken to Jordana
about her mother

969
01:06:27,402 --> 01:06:29,555
because there's
only two possible outcomes.

970
01:06:29,590 --> 01:06:31,190
Either the operation was a success,

971
01:06:31,364 --> 01:06:34,276
in which case she'll be too relieved
to be angry with me for long,

972
01:06:34,451 --> 01:06:35,566
or her mother was dead,

973
01:06:35,743 --> 01:06:38,655
in which case she needs privacy
and time to grieve.

974
01:06:39,956 --> 01:06:42,823
During this brief hiatus,
I can help save my parents' marriage

975
01:06:43,001 --> 01:06:46,334
and then resume my duties
as the best boyfriend in the world.

976
01:07:11,696 --> 01:07:13,687
Oliver.

977
01:07:14,073 --> 01:07:15,028
Yes?

978
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:16,406
- What's this?
- I don't know.

979
01:07:16,576 --> 01:07:17,782
- What is this?
- A letter.

980
01:07:17,952 --> 01:07:19,783
- I don't know what's in it.
- I think you do.

981
01:07:19,954 --> 01:07:21,945
Why did you write this, Oliver?

982
01:07:22,749 --> 01:07:24,159
This isn't funny.

983
01:07:24,334 --> 01:07:26,700
If I did write it, and I'm not as yet
admitting that I did,

984
01:07:26,878 --> 01:07:29,039
it'd be because I spoke to Dad.
This is what he wants.

985
01:07:29,214 --> 01:07:31,796
- You spoke to Dad?
- He knows he's been imperfect.

986
01:07:31,966 --> 01:07:33,547
What did you talk about, Oliver?

987
01:07:33,718 --> 01:07:35,709
Listen,

988
01:07:36,679 --> 01:07:38,010
he still finds you attractive.

989
01:07:38,181 --> 01:07:40,172
He still wants to make love to you.

990
01:07:41,935 --> 01:07:43,095
Are you making this up?

991
01:07:43,269 --> 01:07:46,432
Me and Dad have discussed it.
We both want to make this marriage work.

992
01:07:46,606 --> 01:07:48,267
Are you with us?

993
01:08:34,279 --> 01:08:37,537
Going to the beach with Graham.
I will not be back tonight.

994
01:09:09,647 --> 01:09:12,684
On New Year's Eve,
everyone from town goes to the beach.

995
01:09:12,859 --> 01:09:15,441
Chip said, if a girl won't get off
with you on New Year's Eve,

996
01:09:15,612 --> 01:09:17,022
you may as well cut it off.

997
01:09:17,196 --> 01:09:19,387
I'm starting to think that
we may grow apart.

998
01:09:20,366 --> 01:09:22,327
I don't want a mystic ninja
as a stepdad.

999
01:09:22,601 --> 01:09:24,283
I don't want to be
from a broken home like Chip's,

1000
01:09:24,454 --> 01:09:25,916
wearing tracksuit tops instead of coats

1001
01:09:26,013 --> 01:09:28,708
and taking gateway drugs
in shopping malls.

1002
01:09:29,125 --> 01:09:30,740
I want my family back.

1003
01:09:30,918 --> 01:09:32,909
I don't want anything to change.

1004
01:10:28,476 --> 01:10:30,592
The celebrations are really kicking in,
right?

1005
01:10:30,770 --> 01:10:32,010
Yeah.

1006
01:10:32,188 --> 01:10:34,179
It distresses tiny animals.

1007
01:10:35,650 --> 01:10:36,890
- You can relax, right?
- Mm.

1008
01:10:37,068 --> 01:10:39,525
- There's some lovely massage oils.
- Great. OK.

1009
01:10:39,696 --> 01:10:41,027
In you get.

1010
01:10:41,197 --> 01:10:43,188
All right.

1011
01:11:31,748 --> 01:11:35,036
I have no idea what I'm hoping to
achieve by breaking into Graham's house.

1012
01:11:35,209 --> 01:11:37,245
I just want to give him
the idea that I'm deranged

1013
01:11:37,420 --> 01:11:39,411
and therefore capable of anything.

1014
01:11:39,589 --> 01:11:42,706
This will probably involve me urinating
or something.

1015
01:11:49,348 --> 01:11:51,464
I need a fucking drink.

1016
01:11:56,314 --> 01:11:58,020
I'm doing it. Just do it.

1017
01:11:58,191 --> 01:11:59,806
Just do it...

1018
01:11:59,984 --> 01:12:01,144
Just do it.

1019
01:12:12,205 --> 01:12:13,240
OK.

1020
01:12:13,414 --> 01:12:14,870
Feel my piss.

1021
01:12:15,541 --> 01:12:17,497
Oh, come on.

1022
01:12:17,668 --> 01:12:19,659
Come on.

1023
01:12:21,047 --> 01:12:23,208
Oh, for fuck...

1024
01:12:23,382 --> 01:12:25,373
Fuck.

1025
01:12:25,968 --> 01:12:27,083
It's fine.

1026
01:12:27,261 --> 01:12:29,252
Come on. Just...

1027
01:12:33,559 --> 01:12:36,175
Fucking piss on your face,
you fucking freak.

1028
01:12:39,398 --> 01:12:41,389
For fuck's sake, just come on.
Loosen up.

1029
01:12:48,908 --> 01:12:50,899
Oh, here we go.

1030
01:12:53,913 --> 01:12:55,153
OK, that'll do it.

1031
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:02,501
Jesus Christ.

1032
01:13:06,509 --> 01:13:08,045
Fuck.

1033
01:13:31,033 --> 01:13:33,024
Kim-Lin?

1034
01:13:35,162 --> 01:13:37,153
Is that you?

1035
01:13:38,332 --> 01:13:40,323
Do you still have a key?

1036
01:13:41,627 --> 01:13:43,618
That's very naughty.

1037
01:13:48,509 --> 01:13:50,500
Oh, this is fun, isn't it?

1038
01:13:52,263 --> 01:13:54,345
What kind of protest's this, then, eh?

1039
01:13:55,766 --> 01:13:57,222
Huh?

1040
01:13:57,393 --> 01:14:00,885
How much more of this bizarre behaviour
do I have to endure?

1041
01:14:12,992 --> 01:14:14,698
Nearly went red there.

1042
01:14:14,869 --> 01:14:16,985
Come on, up you get, sweetheart.

1043
01:14:17,163 --> 01:14:19,154
I'm just try...

1044
01:14:23,502 --> 01:14:25,333
My name is not Kim-Lin.

1045
01:14:25,504 --> 01:14:27,995
My name is Oliver Tate.

1046
01:14:34,430 --> 01:14:35,636
Hello.

1047
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:39,174
Hello.

1048
01:14:40,394 --> 01:14:42,385
Hello!

1049
01:14:51,197 --> 01:14:53,188
Knock, knock.

1050
01:14:54,825 --> 01:14:56,486
How are you feeling?

1051
01:14:56,661 --> 01:14:58,526
I saw Mum with Graham at the beach.

1052
01:14:58,704 --> 01:15:00,695
Mm. Mum told me everything.

1053
01:15:01,332 --> 01:15:03,698
Did she say she went into the van
with his face on it?

1054
01:15:03,876 --> 01:15:04,661
Yes.

1055
01:15:04,835 --> 01:15:07,201
Did she say what happened in the van
with his face on it?

1056
01:15:07,380 --> 01:15:08,369
Yes.

1057
01:15:08,547 --> 01:15:10,162
Aren't you angry?

1058
01:15:10,341 --> 01:15:12,206
Worse things have happened at sea, Ol.

1059
01:15:12,385 --> 01:15:14,876
- What did happen?
- That's between your mother and I.

1060
01:15:15,054 --> 01:15:17,010
Lloyd, I think it best we be honest.

1061
01:15:17,181 --> 01:15:18,466
Sweet pea,

1062
01:15:18,641 --> 01:15:20,632
I gave Graham a handjob.

1063
01:15:22,770 --> 01:15:25,432
Is there anything you'd like to say
about that?

1064
01:15:26,232 --> 01:15:28,097
- Lloyd, do you want to add anything?
- No.

1065
01:15:28,275 --> 01:15:32,644
OK. Well, I was drunk
and I was trying to relax Graham.

1066
01:15:32,822 --> 01:15:35,404
- It was a silly thing to do.
- Mm.

1067
01:15:35,908 --> 01:15:37,114
Thank you.

1068
01:15:37,284 --> 01:15:39,275
Your father and I have discussed it

1069
01:15:40,162 --> 01:15:44,201
and if it's OK with everyone,
that's the last we'll say about it.

1070
01:15:44,375 --> 01:15:46,240
OK? Thank you.

1071
01:15:46,419 --> 01:15:50,207
Is there anything
you'd like to talk about now, huh?

1072
01:15:52,258 --> 01:15:54,920
Me and Jordana
are having relationship problems.

1073
01:15:55,094 --> 01:15:57,460
- Oh.
- It's difficult.

1074
01:15:57,638 --> 01:16:00,004
I suppose it won't matter
when I'm 38 but...

1075
01:16:00,182 --> 01:16:01,422
I'm upset about it.

1076
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:03,261
You should be more angry with her.

1077
01:16:03,436 --> 01:16:05,427
Why would I be angry with Jordana?

1078
01:16:06,439 --> 01:16:07,645
Oh, you mean me.

1079
01:16:07,815 --> 01:16:09,351
Yes. No, no. Well, you know, I am.

1080
01:16:09,525 --> 01:16:11,516
Yeah, I'm upset.

1081
01:16:13,612 --> 01:16:15,728
We should go back to sleep, though.

1082
01:16:15,906 --> 01:16:17,362
Yeah.

1083
01:16:17,533 --> 01:16:18,657
We're not going to punish you now

1084
01:16:18,809 --> 01:16:21,305
but we're going to talk about
what you've done.

1085
01:16:21,387 --> 01:16:22,717
What about what you've done?

1086
01:16:22,805 --> 01:16:24,070
OK, don't push it, Ol.

1087
01:16:24,248 --> 01:16:27,456
Well, we'll talk about that too
but you should go back to sleep now, OK?

1088
01:16:27,626 --> 01:16:30,038
- OK.
- Mm?

1089
01:16:32,214 --> 01:16:34,205
Right.

1090
01:17:07,541 --> 01:17:09,581
Dear Oliver, I tried to tell you

1091
01:17:09,620 --> 01:17:10,712
but I figure
you'll only probably believe me

1092
01:17:10,825 --> 01:17:12,827
if it's in writing. It's over.

1093
01:17:13,005 --> 01:17:14,961
I enclose my lighter as a parting gift
for you.

1094
01:17:15,132 --> 01:17:17,464
Also, I think you should know,
I've found someone else.

1095
01:17:17,635 --> 01:17:19,842
When we're in school together,
try not to look upset.

1096
01:17:20,012 --> 01:17:22,003
I know you're a good actor.

1097
01:17:22,181 --> 01:17:26,299
PS: You were right about
my being allergic to dogs. I got tested.

1098
01:17:26,477 --> 01:17:29,219
Oh, and in case you're interested,
my mum's fine now.

1099
01:17:29,396 --> 01:17:31,637
Sorry if it made you feel awkward.

1100
01:17:39,031 --> 01:17:41,647
# ALEX TURNER:
It's Hard To Get Around The Wind

1101
01:17:44,954 --> 01:17:48,412
# It's like you're trying to
get to heaven in a hurry

1102
01:17:48,582 --> 01:17:51,494
# And the queue was shorter
than you thought it'd be

1103
01:17:51,669 --> 01:17:57,209
# And the doorman says,
You need to get a wrist band

1104
01:17:57,967 --> 01:18:01,380
# You got a lift between the pitfalls

1105
01:18:01,554 --> 01:18:04,796
# But you're looking like you're low
on energy

1106
01:18:04,974 --> 01:18:10,514
# Did you get out and walk
to ensure you'd miss the quicksand?

1107
01:18:11,689 --> 01:18:13,429
Could you tell her I called?

1108
01:18:13,607 --> 01:18:16,849
# Looking for a new place to begin
- It's Oliver. Oliver Tate.

1109
01:18:17,903 --> 01:18:19,689
Oh, yeah, she's got my number.

1110
01:18:19,864 --> 01:18:23,607
# Feeling like it's hard to understand

1111
01:18:25,411 --> 01:18:31,498
# But as long as you still
keep peppering the pill

1112
01:18:32,084 --> 01:18:37,044
# You'll find a way to spit it out again

1113
01:18:38,674 --> 01:18:44,761
# And even when you know
the way it's gonna blow

1114
01:18:46,682 --> 01:18:53,520
# It's hard to get around the wind

1115
01:18:53,772 --> 01:18:55,637
None of this will matter when I'm 38.

1116
01:18:55,816 --> 01:18:58,899
But it's been two months
since Jordana last spoke to me.

1117
01:18:59,069 --> 01:19:01,310
Her new boyfriend
has an incredibly long neck.

1118
01:19:04,450 --> 01:19:07,066
Just thinking
about giraffes makes me angry.

1119
01:19:08,746 --> 01:19:10,486
I wish I could hand in this excuse note.

1120
01:19:10,664 --> 01:19:11,779
"Dear Mr Davey,

1121
01:19:11,957 --> 01:19:14,949
Please may Oliver be excused
from class. His tiny heart is broken.

1122
01:19:15,127 --> 01:19:17,118
Yours sincerely, Lloyd Tate. "

1123
01:19:18,255 --> 01:19:20,541
# Stretching out the neck
on your evening

1124
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:24,133
# Trying to even out some deficit

1125
01:19:24,303 --> 01:19:29,798
# But it's sabre-toothed,
multi-ball confusion

1126
01:19:31,101 --> 01:19:34,639
# And you can shriek until you're hollow

1127
01:19:34,813 --> 01:19:37,805
# Or whisper it the other way

1128
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:43,273
# Trying to save the youth
without putting your shoes on

1129
01:19:45,866 --> 01:19:50,075
# Looking for a new place to begin

1130
01:19:52,998 --> 01:19:56,786
- Is he all right?
- He's fine. Just leave him.

1131
01:19:58,837 --> 01:20:04,377
# As long as you still
keep peppering the pill

1132
01:20:05,010 --> 01:20:09,970
# You'll find a way
to spit it out again

1133
01:20:11,642 --> 01:20:17,558
# And even when you know
the way it's gonna blow

1134
01:20:19,233 --> 01:20:23,192
# It's hard

1135
01:20:23,362 --> 01:20:28,106
# To get around the wind

1136
01:20:28,909 --> 01:20:32,777
In my other recurring dream,
I mentally rehearse the end scene.

1137
01:20:32,955 --> 01:20:35,913
The one where it's getting dark
and I mistake a girl for Jordana.

1138
01:20:36,083 --> 01:20:39,291
A girl with the exact same frame
and the exact same hair.

1139
01:20:39,461 --> 01:20:42,544
And when she turns around, I see
her face is nothing like Jordana's.

1140
01:20:42,715 --> 01:20:44,831
And she asks, "Do I know you?"

1141
01:20:45,009 --> 01:20:46,715
And I look traumatised and say...

1142
01:20:46,885 --> 01:20:48,500
No.

1143
01:20:48,679 --> 01:20:50,340
You don't know me.

1144
01:20:50,514 --> 01:20:52,550
You don't know me at all.

1145
01:20:54,143 --> 01:20:56,600
I think this will matter when I'm older,
when I'm 38.

1146
01:20:56,770 --> 01:20:59,102
- Don't you knock any more?
- Sorry, Oliver. What?

1147
01:20:59,273 --> 01:21:01,605
Jordana...
I think it will matter when I'm older.

1148
01:21:01,775 --> 01:21:03,140
Yeah, course it will.

1149
01:21:03,319 --> 01:21:05,355
OK, well... Good night.

1150
01:21:10,492 --> 01:21:13,780
# And I can hear you through my window

1151
01:21:13,954 --> 01:21:17,071
# But I'm never quite sure who is who

1152
01:21:17,249 --> 01:21:22,744
# But they want the world
on a dessert spoon

1153
01:21:24,048 --> 01:21:27,131
# It always sounds like they're fighting

1154
01:21:27,301 --> 01:21:30,919
# Or as if that's what
they're about to do

1155
01:21:31,096 --> 01:21:33,132
# It might not hurt now

1156
01:21:33,307 --> 01:21:36,674
# But it's gonna hurt soon

1157
01:21:48,197 --> 01:21:50,188
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1158
01:21:51,784 --> 01:21:54,025
You've got to be shitting me.

1159
01:21:54,328 --> 01:21:55,113
Pritchard.

1160
01:21:55,287 --> 01:21:57,619
Pritchard, take a look at this.
It's as funny as fuck.

1161
01:21:57,790 --> 01:22:00,076
All right, whose note is that?

1162
01:22:05,297 --> 01:22:08,039
It's mine.

1163
01:22:08,926 --> 01:22:11,918
Thank you, Oliver,
for your refreshing honesty.

1164
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:14,303
But you know the rules.
Up you come, read it out.

1165
01:23:00,477 --> 01:23:02,138
It was just a joke?

1166
01:23:02,312 --> 01:23:03,392
Yeah.

1167
01:23:03,564 --> 01:23:06,431
OK, well, as I say,
if it was just a joke then that's fine.

1168
01:23:06,608 --> 01:23:09,520
But if ever you have serious feelings

1169
01:23:09,695 --> 01:23:12,937
of, you know, difficulty

1170
01:23:13,115 --> 01:23:14,355
or sadness

1171
01:23:14,533 --> 01:23:17,866
or any negative feelings that you want
to talk about, feel free to come and...

1172
01:23:18,036 --> 01:23:19,196
I know, I know, yeah.

1173
01:23:19,371 --> 01:23:20,656
I can talk to you about that.

1174
01:23:20,831 --> 01:23:22,367
OK. I don't want to embarrass you

1175
01:23:22,541 --> 01:23:26,534
but I just wanted you to know that
I'm open to talking whenever you want.

1176
01:23:26,712 --> 01:23:27,827
Yeah. OK.

1177
01:23:28,005 --> 01:23:28,835
Cool.

1178
01:23:29,006 --> 01:23:30,371
Good.

1179
01:23:30,549 --> 01:23:32,915
Nice one, Ol. Nice one, you fuck-muppet.

1180
01:23:33,093 --> 01:23:36,051
Why write stuff like that? Perhaps
people are right and you are gay.

1181
01:23:36,221 --> 01:23:39,258
"Jordana, I love you. I want to
have your babies, get married. "

1182
01:23:39,433 --> 01:23:40,468
What the fuck?

1183
01:23:40,642 --> 01:23:44,385
- Fuck you, Chips.
- What the fuck are you up to, you fool?

1184
01:23:59,369 --> 01:24:00,404
What?

1185
01:24:00,579 --> 01:24:02,240
- You're a loser.
- Go and see the girl

1186
01:24:02,414 --> 01:24:04,200
- who doesn't like you.
- I'll be back.

1187
01:24:04,374 --> 01:24:05,989
I'll hit you in the face.

1188
01:24:10,464 --> 01:24:13,376
Can I have a word, please, in private,
without him?

1189
01:24:13,926 --> 01:24:15,257
I'm fine here.

1190
01:24:16,136 --> 01:24:17,672
Sorry I didn't come to the hospital.

1191
01:24:17,846 --> 01:24:19,507
I thought my parents were
going to split up

1192
01:24:19,681 --> 01:24:21,797
and I didn't want to look weak
or things to change.

1193
01:24:21,975 --> 01:24:24,341
My mum gave a hand-job to a mystic.

1194
01:24:27,773 --> 01:24:29,764
Look, I was frightened.

1195
01:24:30,275 --> 01:24:32,106
I'm full of regret.

1196
01:24:38,867 --> 01:24:41,449
This is the moment where you leave him
and come with me.

1197
01:24:45,874 --> 01:24:47,535
Is it?

1198
01:24:47,709 --> 01:24:49,540
Yeah.

1199
01:24:49,711 --> 01:24:51,702
Are you coming?

1200
01:24:54,591 --> 01:24:56,582
No.

1201
01:26:08,248 --> 01:26:11,206
I don't know if I've come of age
but I'm certainly older now.

1202
01:26:11,376 --> 01:26:14,960
I feel shrunken, as if there's
a tiny ancient Oliver Tate inside me

1203
01:26:15,130 --> 01:26:17,872
operating the levers of
a life-size Oliver-shaped shell.

1204
01:26:18,050 --> 01:26:20,211
A shell on which a decrepit picture show

1205
01:26:20,385 --> 01:26:22,376
replays the same handful of images.

1206
01:26:39,824 --> 01:26:41,418
Every night I come to the same place

1207
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:43,703
and wait till the sky catches up
with my mood.

1208
01:26:45,285 --> 01:26:46,741
The pattern is set.

1209
01:26:46,912 --> 01:26:50,279
This is, no doubt, the end.

1210
01:27:07,224 --> 01:27:08,304
Jordana!

1211
01:27:17,275 --> 01:27:18,981
Jordana!

1212
01:27:22,197 --> 01:27:24,062
It is you.

1213
01:27:24,241 --> 01:27:26,448
I didn't think it'd be you, I...

1214
01:27:27,536 --> 01:27:30,778
I thought it'd be like a film where
the girl turns round and it's not the...

1215
01:27:30,956 --> 01:27:32,492
You've got a new dog. You're allergic.

1216
01:27:32,666 --> 01:27:34,156
- Oliver.
- Where's your boyfriend?

1217
01:27:34,334 --> 01:27:35,619
He's not my boyfriend.

1218
01:27:35,794 --> 01:27:38,501
Your skin's looking bad, terrible.
It's probably the dog.

1219
01:27:38,672 --> 01:27:40,458
I don't care about my fucking skin.

1220
01:27:40,632 --> 01:27:43,715
- Why on earth did you get a new dog?
- Because I like dogs, OK?

1221
01:27:43,885 --> 01:27:45,466
Why are you such a total dick?

1222
01:27:45,637 --> 01:27:47,628
I don't know.

1223
01:27:48,765 --> 01:27:51,131
I was crying earlier.
My eyes are probably red.

1224
01:27:51,309 --> 01:27:52,344
They look fine.

1225
01:27:52,519 --> 01:27:54,601
No, well,
maybe they don't go red when I cry.

1226
01:27:54,771 --> 01:27:56,762
It happens to some.

1227
01:27:59,484 --> 01:28:01,315
You were horrible to me.

1228
01:28:03,488 --> 01:28:05,854
I know. I made a mistake.

1229
01:28:06,032 --> 01:28:08,569
I made a mistake.
What do you want me to say?

1230
01:28:13,623 --> 01:28:15,238
- Ask me how deep the ocean is.
- Shut up.

1231
01:28:15,417 --> 01:28:16,452
Go on, just ask me.

1232
01:28:16,626 --> 01:28:18,036
- Why?
- Because I know the answer.

1233
01:28:18,211 --> 01:28:19,917
- Oh, do you?
- Yeah. I do.

1234
01:28:20,088 --> 01:28:21,498
- How deep?
- I'm not going to say.

1235
01:28:21,673 --> 01:28:23,664
I'm broken-hearted.

1236
01:28:24,843 --> 01:28:26,925
- The ocean is six miles deep.
- Good.
