<i>Can you believe that? A musical version
of "Sweet Bird of Youth."</i>

2
00:01:26,354 --> 00:01:29,426
<i>- Who are they kidding?
- Thank God, you wanted to leave.</i>

3
00:01:29,514 --> 00:01:33,063
<i>Can you believe Madeline Ashton?
Talk about waking the dead.</i>

4
00:01:33,154 --> 00:01:35,588
I gotta get a drink.

5
00:01:47,154 --> 00:01:51,113
What do I see

6
00:01:51,154 --> 00:01:56,433
That's the question
I'm most afraid of

7
00:01:56,514 --> 00:02:05,627
<i>One that asks me
what I'm really made of</i>

8
00:02:07,674 --> 00:02:11,383
What do I see

9
00:02:11,474 --> 00:02:17,470
Much more
than a reflection

10
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:25,063
<i>A romance with
sheer perfection</i>

11
00:02:26,834 --> 00:02:30,110
I see me
I see me

12
00:02:30,194 --> 00:02:33,709
<i>Actress, woman
star and lover</i>

13
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:38,066
<i>Sister, sweetheart
slave and mother</i>

14
00:02:38,154 --> 00:02:39,792
I see me

15
00:02:39,834 --> 00:02:41,711
<i>And I like
what I see</i>

16
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:45,230
Virgin, temptress
dream of others

17
00:02:45,314 --> 00:02:47,623
Yes, it's me

18
00:02:47,674 --> 00:02:51,428
Yes, it's me

19
00:02:57,474 --> 00:03:00,705
- We see you
- You mean me

20
00:03:00,754 --> 00:03:04,224
Idol, goddess
shameless hussy

21
00:03:04,274 --> 00:03:08,586
<i>Diva, princess
lewd and lusty</i>

22
00:03:49,554 --> 00:03:52,466
She's sensational.

23
00:03:57,474 --> 00:04:00,830
That's not me
Can't be me

24
00:04:00,914 --> 00:04:04,224
- Angel devil
- You can trust me

25
00:04:04,274 --> 00:04:06,947
Mon ami

26
00:04:06,994 --> 00:04:09,144
I see

27
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:15,985
<i>Whoo-whoo</i>

28
00:04:18,394 --> 00:04:22,273
<i>Everywhere I look, baby
all I see is</i>

29
00:04:22,354 --> 00:04:24,106
- A contradiction
- Oh, come on

30
00:04:24,194 --> 00:04:25,832
- A bad addiction
- Knock it off

31
00:04:25,874 --> 00:04:29,469
<i>- Inspiration to a generation
- Now you're talkin'</i>

32
00:04:29,554 --> 00:04:31,943
That's you

33
00:04:32,034 --> 00:04:38,303
That's me

34
00:04:41,394 --> 00:04:43,350
<i>Wow!</i>

35
00:04:43,434 --> 00:04:46,028
Oh, boy!

36
00:04:46,114 --> 00:04:48,469
Whoo!

37
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:50,704
Whoo!

38
00:04:52,194 --> 00:04:56,073
<i>Wrinkled, wrinkled little star...</i>

39
00:04:56,114 --> 00:04:59,709
hope they never
see the scars.

40
00:05:05,234 --> 00:05:07,748
Your guests are here,
Miss Ashton.

41
00:05:07,794 --> 00:05:10,388
<i>A Miss Helen Sharp
with a gentleman.</i>

42
00:05:10,474 --> 00:05:13,625
<i>- Ahh. How's she look?
- Who?</i>

43
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:15,989
Helen, you idiot.

44
00:05:16,074 --> 00:05:18,668
<i>I don't know.
Smart, I guess, sort of classy.</i>

45
00:05:18,714 --> 00:05:21,387
<i>Classy? Really?
Compared to whom?</i>

46
00:05:21,474 --> 00:05:25,547
Oh, shit.

47
00:05:41,834 --> 00:05:43,392
Mad!

48
00:05:43,474 --> 00:05:45,908
Hel!

49
00:05:48,394 --> 00:05:51,192
<i>- I don't believe it.
- How are you?</i>

50
00:05:51,274 --> 00:05:53,230
<i>- It's been so long.
- I know.</i>

51
00:05:53,314 --> 00:05:56,112
<i>Don't you dare say how long.</i>

52
00:05:56,194 --> 00:05:59,186
Mad, I'd like you to meet...

53
00:05:59,274 --> 00:06:01,742
Dr. Ernest Menville, my fiance.

54
00:06:01,834 --> 00:06:03,825
<i>You were just wonderful.</i>

55
00:06:03,914 --> 00:06:06,587
Ernest Menville? Dr. Ernest Menville,
the plastic surgeon?

56
00:06:06,674 --> 00:06:10,747
<i>- Yes. You were so terrific!
- Ernest is quite a fan.</i>

57
00:06:10,834 --> 00:06:13,473
- I've read all about you.
- That dance number. Boy, oh, boy.

58
00:06:13,554 --> 00:06:16,910
- I can't believe I'm meeting you.
- He never mentioned a Madeline thing.

59
00:06:16,954 --> 00:06:21,789
- We're both huge fans.
- I'm sure he doesn't have a... thing.

60
00:06:21,874 --> 00:06:24,786
Do you?

61
00:06:24,874 --> 00:06:30,187
Well, I'm so happy
for you... both.

62
00:06:30,234 --> 00:06:34,068
<i>What ever happened to that,
um, writing thing?</i>

63
00:06:34,154 --> 00:06:38,033
<i>- Oh, well, um, I'm still trying.
- Helen, don't be modest.</i>

64
00:06:38,114 --> 00:06:42,392
<i>- She's a brilliant writer, Mrs. Ashton.
- Miss.</i>

65
00:06:42,474 --> 00:06:44,749
Tell me, Doctor...

66
00:06:44,794 --> 00:06:48,104
do you think that
I'm starting to need you?

67
00:06:50,714 --> 00:06:53,103
So...

68
00:06:54,634 --> 00:06:56,511
<i>have you two set a date?</i>

69
00:06:56,594 --> 00:06:58,824
<i>- Yes... we have.
- No, actually...</i>

70
00:07:00,314 --> 00:07:04,068
We see
the upper eyelid skin incision...

71
00:07:04,114 --> 00:07:07,424
from the medial canthus
to the lateral orbital margin.

72
00:07:07,474 --> 00:07:10,466
<i>There are two fat compartments
in the upper eyelid, three in the lower.</i>

73
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:13,074
Oops. Look at all this bleeding.

74
00:07:13,154 --> 00:07:17,272
Needle-tip cautery. Quickly, please.

75
00:07:22,554 --> 00:07:25,830
<i>For heaven's sake,
Helen, it was a dinner.</i>

76
00:07:25,874 --> 00:07:28,468
<i>The woman wanted
my professional opinion.</i>

77
00:07:28,554 --> 00:07:31,626
<i>Ernest, you don't know Madeline
the way I do.</i>

78
00:07:31,714 --> 00:07:35,263
<i>She wants you.
She wants you because you're mine.</i>

79
00:07:35,314 --> 00:07:37,669
I've lost men to her before.

80
00:07:37,714 --> 00:07:41,593
She just turns on that flash
and that glitter and they're gone.

81
00:07:41,674 --> 00:07:44,586
<i>That's why I wanted you to meet her
before we got married.</i>

82
00:07:44,674 --> 00:07:49,270
I just had to see if you could pass
the Madeline Ashton test.

83
00:07:49,354 --> 00:07:52,790
Please...
Please, don't fail.

84
00:07:52,874 --> 00:07:56,708
I couldn't
take it again.

85
00:07:56,754 --> 00:07:59,268
<i>I don't know
what I'd do.</i>

86
00:07:59,314 --> 00:08:03,387
<i>Do you know how
silly you're sounding?</i>

87
00:08:04,634 --> 00:08:06,625
Oh, darling,

88
00:08:06,674 --> 00:08:11,065
I have absolutely no interest
in Madeline Ashton.

89
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:31,024
Mrs. Helen Sharp? It's your landlord.
Open the door, please.

90
00:09:31,114 --> 00:09:33,912
<i>I know you're in there!</i>

91
00:09:33,994 --> 00:09:36,713
I have your final
eviction notice.

92
00:09:36,754 --> 00:09:38,745
If you don't come out,

93
00:09:38,834 --> 00:09:42,952
- I'm going to break the door.
- What are you doing here?

94
00:09:42,994 --> 00:09:46,225
<i>I have the police. If you don't open,
we're going to break the door.</i>

95
00:09:46,314 --> 00:09:50,990
- Well, speak!
- I'm going to charge you for it too.

96
00:09:51,074 --> 00:09:55,625
<i>- Lady, let's go.
- You heard what he said.</i>

97
00:09:59,794 --> 00:10:04,106
You're in trouble.

98
00:10:04,154 --> 00:10:08,272
Come on. Open it!

99
00:10:21,794 --> 00:10:25,787
Lady, listen.
You have the right to remain silent.

100
00:10:25,874 --> 00:10:28,183
If you give up the right
to remain silent...

101
00:10:28,274 --> 00:10:31,232
Are you nuts?

102
00:10:31,314 --> 00:10:33,544
Come on.
Get her outta here!

103
00:10:33,594 --> 00:10:35,664
So...

104
00:10:38,634 --> 00:10:40,625
<i>what about you, Helen?</i>

105
00:10:40,714 --> 00:10:44,423
<i>We haven't heard from you
in a while.</i>

106
00:10:44,474 --> 00:10:47,511
Is there anything...

107
00:10:47,594 --> 00:10:51,348
<i>you'd like to...
talk about... with the group?</i>

108
00:10:57,874 --> 00:10:59,751
Yes.

109
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:07,629
<i>I would like
to talk about...</i>

110
00:11:09,354 --> 00:11:10,833
Madeline...

111
00:11:10,874 --> 00:11:12,193
Ashton.

112
00:11:12,274 --> 00:11:14,390
Stop! Stop it!
Stop!

113
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:17,147
No! No!

114
00:11:22,674 --> 00:11:24,904
<i>Is this where we are, Helen?</i>

115
00:11:24,994 --> 00:11:28,225
Six months of therapy.
You're not one pound lighter.

116
00:11:28,274 --> 00:11:31,072
<i>And we are still talking
about Madeline Ashton!</i>

117
00:11:31,154 --> 00:11:34,749
- You think I enjoy talking about her?
- Do you think I enjoy it?

118
00:11:34,834 --> 00:11:37,712
<i>Is that what you think?
You better think again!</i>

119
00:11:37,754 --> 00:11:42,225
Oh, Helen,
for you to have a life,

120
00:11:42,314 --> 00:11:45,545
for any of us
to have a life,

121
00:11:45,634 --> 00:11:47,625
you have got to forget
about her.

122
00:11:47,714 --> 00:11:50,023
You have to erase her
from your mind.

123
00:11:50,074 --> 00:11:53,623
- You have to completely eliminate any...
- What?

124
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:56,592
You have to completely
eliminate...

125
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:59,063
You're right.

126
00:11:59,154 --> 00:12:00,428
What?

127
00:12:00,514 --> 00:12:04,143
You're absolutely right.

128
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:23,505
Yes?

129
00:12:23,594 --> 00:12:27,303
I have a delivery for Madeline Ashton
and Dr. Ernest Menville.

130
00:13:01,034 --> 00:13:03,309
Good morning, madam.

131
00:13:03,354 --> 00:13:07,108
You look
absolutely marvelous.

132
00:13:07,154 --> 00:13:09,463
<i>Hey, wait a minute.</i>

133
00:13:10,594 --> 00:13:12,903
Aren't you forgetting something?

134
00:13:12,994 --> 00:13:15,952
- It's only Thursday. I'm supposed to...
- Never mind.

135
00:13:16,034 --> 00:13:18,992
I think I need you
to say it every morning.

136
00:13:19,034 --> 00:13:21,104
<i>Very well.</i>

137
00:13:21,194 --> 00:13:23,628
Oh, madam,
you look younger every day.

138
00:13:23,714 --> 00:13:27,263
Thank you, Rose.
Thank you very much.

139
00:13:27,314 --> 00:13:29,384
<i>It's so sweet...
What is this?</i>

140
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:33,586
Your tickets for
Helen Sharp's book party.

141
00:13:33,674 --> 00:13:36,347
They just came.

142
00:13:36,434 --> 00:13:39,585
Helen Sharp's book party!

143
00:13:39,634 --> 00:13:42,512
- "Forever Young"?
- I like that title.

144
00:13:45,114 --> 00:13:48,663
Oh, forever young!
Right.

145
00:13:48,754 --> 00:13:51,632
And eternally fat!

146
00:13:51,714 --> 00:13:56,185
<i>Oh, clever little witch.
She sent seating assignments.</i>

147
00:13:57,514 --> 00:13:59,869
I find it very hard
to believe...

148
00:13:59,954 --> 00:14:03,629
that he got up early
and made his side of the bed.

149
00:14:03,714 --> 00:14:07,866
<i>- No, madam.
- So where did he sleep?</i>

150
00:14:07,954 --> 00:14:09,945
Again?

151
00:14:12,234 --> 00:14:16,022
<i>The beaver has always
been of interest to man.</i>

152
00:14:18,074 --> 00:14:21,191
<i>It is the second largest
rodent in the world.</i>

153
00:14:27,554 --> 00:14:30,193
Dr. Menville?

154
00:14:30,234 --> 00:14:34,386
Dr. Menville?

155
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:39,473
Is this an angel
I see before me?

156
00:14:39,554 --> 00:14:43,945
- Dr. Menville, you're so cute.
- Thank you, Rose.

157
00:14:49,074 --> 00:14:52,430
Oh!

158
00:14:52,514 --> 00:14:55,153
More vodka.

159
00:14:55,994 --> 00:14:58,303
An outstanding characteristic
of a beaver...

160
00:14:58,354 --> 00:15:01,790
is the large, flat tail.

161
00:15:08,994 --> 00:15:11,952
- Is it up yet?
- Yes, sir.

162
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,667
It's in the bath.

163
00:15:14,754 --> 00:15:19,145
<i>Your beeper was beeping.
It's Mr. Franklin again.</i>

164
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:32,022
Rose!
Oh, it's you.

165
00:15:32,114 --> 00:15:34,674
Fine, dear, thank you.
Like a rock.

166
00:15:34,754 --> 00:15:36,790
You're dressed.
Special occasion?

167
00:15:36,874 --> 00:15:38,705
- Work.
- Ghoul!

168
00:15:38,794 --> 00:15:41,672
Dr. Menville,
thank God.

169
00:15:41,714 --> 00:15:45,229
- I'm sorry to call at the last minute.
- Yes.

170
00:15:45,314 --> 00:15:49,592
<i>He's completely prepped. Our top staff
have been summoned and are waiting.</i>

171
00:15:49,674 --> 00:15:51,983
<i>Good, I'm sure he'll be fine.
Just calm down.</i>

172
00:15:52,074 --> 00:15:55,271
Calm? I am calm.
Everyone is calm here.

173
00:15:55,314 --> 00:15:57,748
- Who is it?
- Fernando Rivas, the actor.

174
00:15:57,834 --> 00:16:01,873
<i>He drowned in his hot tub.
Very bloated, very swollen.</i>

175
00:16:01,954 --> 00:16:04,946
<i>He was making love
to his new fiancee.</i>

176
00:16:05,034 --> 00:16:08,026
Eighteen years old,
from Cuba.

177
00:16:08,114 --> 00:16:10,753
He's got this expression of happiness
that is completely inappropriate.

178
00:16:10,834 --> 00:16:14,873
<i>Thank you, Mr. Franklin, we'll see
if we can't give him a little character,</i>

179
00:16:14,954 --> 00:16:16,592
a little depth.

180
00:16:16,674 --> 00:16:21,907
Depth? Oh, no, Dr. Menville, you can't
give him any character or depth.

181
00:16:21,994 --> 00:16:24,906
People have
to recognize him.

182
00:16:24,994 --> 00:16:28,703
<i>- Good afternoon, Miss Ashton.
- 3:00 with Anna.</i>

183
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:30,745
<i>Yes, I know.
You may go down.</i>

184
00:16:36,794 --> 00:16:40,582
<i>Miss Ashton, how are you?
So good to see you!</i>

185
00:16:40,634 --> 00:16:44,547
Listen, I've got a really
important party tonight.

186
00:16:44,594 --> 00:16:47,745
Really important.
You understand?

187
00:16:47,794 --> 00:16:51,264
<i>You will be the best one!</i>

188
00:16:51,314 --> 00:16:53,874
I have to be
better than that.

189
00:16:53,914 --> 00:16:55,950
I am sorry,
but the plasma separation...

190
00:16:56,034 --> 00:16:58,548
is a very traumatic
process to the body!

191
00:16:58,634 --> 00:17:01,023
Our policy
clearly prohibits...

192
00:17:01,074 --> 00:17:03,952
more than one
in a six-month period.

193
00:17:03,994 --> 00:17:06,428
So? It's been nearly
that long already.

194
00:17:06,514 --> 00:17:10,792
<i>Miss Ashton, you had one
three weeks ago.</i>

195
00:17:10,834 --> 00:17:14,270
<i>- How about a nice collagen buff?
- "A collagen buff"?</i>

196
00:17:14,354 --> 00:17:17,426
<i>You might as well ask me
to wash with soap and water!</i>

197
00:17:19,314 --> 00:17:22,112
Tonight is
very important to me.

198
00:17:22,194 --> 00:17:25,869
- I could do your makeup myself.
- Makeup is pointless!

199
00:17:25,954 --> 00:17:28,548
It does nothing anymore.

200
00:17:28,594 --> 00:17:30,789
Are you listening to me?
Do you even care?

201
00:17:30,834 --> 00:17:34,031
<i>You stand there with your 22-year-old
skin and your tits like rocks...</i>

202
00:17:34,074 --> 00:17:36,827
and laugh at me.

203
00:17:43,194 --> 00:17:45,344
Mmm.

204
00:17:45,394 --> 00:17:48,545
I could pay you extra.

205
00:17:49,634 --> 00:17:53,183
Something...
on a personal basis.

206
00:17:53,234 --> 00:17:55,953
<i>You know what I mean?
How about that?</i>

207
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:58,867
Money is no object.
It means nothing to me.

208
00:17:58,954 --> 00:18:01,263
Ahem.

209
00:18:01,354 --> 00:18:04,903
I'm sorry, Mr. Chagall.
I'm really, really sorry.

210
00:18:04,994 --> 00:18:07,713
<i>Anna, don't talk,
just go away.</i>

211
00:18:07,794 --> 00:18:10,103
Leave us alone, mmm?

212
00:18:10,194 --> 00:18:13,186
<i>- I don't want to look at you anymore.
- Oh, okay.</i>

213
00:18:13,234 --> 00:18:15,304
Thank you so much.

214
00:18:17,114 --> 00:18:19,628
Please.

215
00:18:21,274 --> 00:18:24,027
- I suppose I should apologize.
- Oh, no, no.

216
00:18:24,114 --> 00:18:28,585
I am very sensitive
to your torment.

217
00:18:28,634 --> 00:18:31,785
<i>- Excuse me?
- But unfortunately we are mere mortals.</i>

218
00:18:31,874 --> 00:18:37,028
<i>We are restricted by the...
laws of nature.</i>

219
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,986
<i>Well, what more
could one expect?</i>

220
00:18:40,074 --> 00:18:42,827
Mmm, mmm,
that depends.

221
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:48,113
I could not help but overhear your
little joke about money being no object.

222
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:50,992
<i>- That was no joke!
- I see.</i>

223
00:18:53,234 --> 00:18:55,509
<i>I wonder, Miss Ashton,</i>

224
00:18:55,594 --> 00:18:59,507
if perhaps you have
ever heard of...

225
00:19:01,594 --> 00:19:03,471
Lisle Von Rhuman?

226
00:19:03,554 --> 00:19:06,022
Ah... no.

227
00:19:06,074 --> 00:19:08,907
<i>No, of course you haven't.
Very few have.</i>

228
00:19:08,954 --> 00:19:10,990
Only a select group.

229
00:19:11,074 --> 00:19:13,872
She may be able to help you.

230
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,384
Here is her address.

231
00:19:17,474 --> 00:19:20,910
She accepts callers day...
and night.

232
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:22,347
Eh...

233
00:19:22,434 --> 00:19:26,552
It is a very, very select group,
you understand?

234
00:19:26,634 --> 00:19:28,943
Sure.

235
00:19:31,274 --> 00:19:34,983
I'm glad this happened,
Miss Ashton.

236
00:19:35,034 --> 00:19:39,186
We shall be seeing
more of you, I think.

237
00:19:39,274 --> 00:19:41,265
Yes, I think so.

238
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:49,624
Weirdo.

239
00:19:56,474 --> 00:19:59,386
Could you just
not breathe?

240
00:20:08,914 --> 00:20:11,951
<i>Jesus, what'd she do?
Hire extras?</i>

241
00:20:11,994 --> 00:20:13,871
Good evening.

242
00:20:16,474 --> 00:20:19,307
Evian, please.
No ice.

243
00:20:20,474 --> 00:20:22,783
- Dr. Menville?
- Yes.

244
00:20:22,834 --> 00:20:25,587
- Ernest Menville?
- Yes.

245
00:20:25,674 --> 00:20:29,747
<i>- Hi, I'm Vivian Adams.
- Hi, h-h-have we met?</i>

246
00:20:29,834 --> 00:20:32,143
Long ago. I never had
a chance to thank you...

247
00:20:32,234 --> 00:20:37,228
<i>for the spectacular job
you did with my Aunt Esther.</i>

248
00:20:37,274 --> 00:20:39,629
<i>Oh, well,
thank you very much.</i>

249
00:20:39,674 --> 00:20:42,313
Her color, her tone.

250
00:20:42,354 --> 00:20:46,233
- You even brought out her cheekbones.
- Well, that's my job.

251
00:20:46,314 --> 00:20:48,908
<i>It was almost a shame
to bury her.</i>

252
00:20:48,954 --> 00:20:51,149
<i>It's so sweet of you
to say that.</i>

253
00:20:51,194 --> 00:20:53,992
<i>Can I ask you
what your secret is?</i>

254
00:20:54,034 --> 00:20:56,104
Spray paint.

255
00:20:57,394 --> 00:21:01,831
You see, you can't just use
regular makeup on dead skin.

256
00:21:01,874 --> 00:21:03,751
The pores are too dry.

257
00:21:03,794 --> 00:21:06,672
You've gotta use a palette
and grind the stuff in.

258
00:21:06,754 --> 00:21:10,030
<i>One day I'm in the hardware store and
I think, "What about mannequin paint?"</i>

259
00:21:10,114 --> 00:21:14,744
<i>It's got its own chemical adhesive,
comes in a variety of flesh...</i>

260
00:21:16,034 --> 00:21:18,594
Excuse me!

261
00:21:33,874 --> 00:21:35,944
Have you seen her yet?

262
00:21:36,034 --> 00:21:40,027
What a joke. She's not even here.

263
00:21:41,714 --> 00:21:45,673
- Oh, look over there.
- Wh...

264
00:21:45,714 --> 00:21:50,185
<i>Oh, looks as though
she's lost a few pounds!</i>

265
00:21:55,634 --> 00:21:58,751
- We're leaving.
- Nonsense. Let's go talk to her.

266
00:21:58,834 --> 00:22:02,827
No. I'll talk to her.

267
00:22:04,234 --> 00:22:08,625
<i>I just want you to know
that I am at your disposal.</i>

268
00:22:08,714 --> 00:22:11,911
You can call me day or night.

269
00:22:11,954 --> 00:22:14,514
I did give you all my numbers?

270
00:22:27,394 --> 00:22:28,668
Mad?

271
00:22:28,754 --> 00:22:31,473
Hel!

272
00:22:37,354 --> 00:22:40,710
I don't believe it!

273
00:22:40,754 --> 00:22:45,874
Helen, darling, 12 years!
12 long years!

274
00:22:45,914 --> 00:22:49,145
<i>And look at you,
you have a... waist.</i>

275
00:22:49,234 --> 00:22:52,271
Oh, you haven't changed.

276
00:22:52,314 --> 00:22:55,306
<i>Gosh, I'm glad you came.
I didn't know if you would.</i>

277
00:22:55,394 --> 00:22:57,749
<i>I spoke to my P.R. woman
and she said,</i>

278
00:22:57,834 --> 00:23:00,632
"Madeline Ashton goes
to the opening of an envelope."

279
00:23:00,714 --> 00:23:03,353
Those people can be so cruel.

280
00:23:03,434 --> 00:23:06,585
I fired her.
Well, I almost fired her.

281
00:23:06,674 --> 00:23:08,869
<i>Well, that was
sweet of you, dear.</i>

282
00:23:08,914 --> 00:23:10,905
- Would you mind?
- Not at all.

283
00:23:10,994 --> 00:23:15,431
<i>- So, how's it been?
- Heaven, it's absolute heaven.</i>

284
00:23:15,474 --> 00:23:18,307
- Ernest is a dream.
- I'm so happy for you both.

285
00:23:18,354 --> 00:23:21,107
I often thought to myself
"I don't deserve this"...

286
00:23:21,194 --> 00:23:24,152
because it came
at your expense.

287
00:23:24,234 --> 00:23:27,624
And that thought
made me feel... terrible.

288
00:23:27,714 --> 00:23:30,831
<i>Listen, that was a long time ago.</i>

289
00:23:30,914 --> 00:23:34,987
<i>You didn't steal him.
He went to you.</i>

290
00:23:35,074 --> 00:23:38,032
<i>It wasn't you.
It was him.</i>

291
00:23:38,114 --> 00:23:40,912
<i>I want you to know something.</i>

292
00:23:40,954 --> 00:23:46,187
I have never ever blamed you.
Never!

293
00:23:54,354 --> 00:23:58,506
<i>- Do you believe how she looks?
- How old is she?</i>

294
00:23:58,594 --> 00:24:01,108
- Fifty.
- Fifty?

295
00:24:01,194 --> 00:24:03,469
You've gotta be kidding.

296
00:24:03,554 --> 00:24:06,944
<i>I wonder what
her secret is.</i>

297
00:24:28,154 --> 00:24:32,591
- Life has turned out as quite a party.
- You used to hate parties.

298
00:24:32,674 --> 00:24:35,746
<i>That was when I was old.
You should see me now.</i>

299
00:24:35,794 --> 00:24:39,070
<i>I didn't know
you were so unhappy.</i>

300
00:24:42,754 --> 00:24:45,143
Never could lie to you.

301
00:24:47,314 --> 00:24:51,512
<i>I know about the kind of...
work you're doing now.</i>

302
00:24:51,594 --> 00:24:53,664
<i>It's not work.</i>

303
00:24:53,714 --> 00:24:57,707
<i>I would sell my soul
to be able to operate again.</i>

304
00:24:57,794 --> 00:25:02,106
<i>- Oh, Helen, I've wasted my life.
- No, Ernest.</i>

305
00:25:02,194 --> 00:25:04,913
<i>She's wasted you.</i>

306
00:25:04,954 --> 00:25:07,832
She married
a brilliant surgeon...

307
00:25:07,914 --> 00:25:10,587
and turned him
into an undertaker.

308
00:25:10,674 --> 00:25:13,472
<i>I want you
to know something.</i>

309
00:25:13,554 --> 00:25:17,024
I have never blamed you
for leaving me.

310
00:25:17,074 --> 00:25:20,111
<i>I always knew it was her.</i>

311
00:25:20,194 --> 00:25:22,947
<i>She's a woman.</i>

312
00:25:22,994 --> 00:25:26,509
<i>A woman, Ernest.</i>

313
00:25:26,554 --> 00:25:28,749
<i>From Newark, for God's sakes.</i>

314
00:25:28,834 --> 00:25:33,954
<i>I will never forgive her
for what she's done to you.</i>

315
00:25:35,594 --> 00:25:37,550
Never.

316
00:26:07,634 --> 00:26:09,864
Dakota!

317
00:26:10,754 --> 00:26:13,222
Oh!

318
00:26:13,274 --> 00:26:15,151
Oh!

319
00:26:17,434 --> 00:26:19,186
<i>- What's wrong?
- Nothing.</i>

320
00:26:19,274 --> 00:26:21,230
<i>I didn't know
you were coming over.</i>

321
00:26:21,314 --> 00:26:23,782
- Oh, my God, you're not alone.
- Of course I am.

322
00:26:23,834 --> 00:26:26,507
- I'm completely alone.
- Dakota?

323
00:26:26,594 --> 00:26:29,631
<i>Actually, completely
isn't quite what I meant.</i>

324
00:26:29,714 --> 00:26:33,309
<i>- How dare you make me feel cheap!
- Madeline, I forgot.</i>

325
00:26:33,394 --> 00:26:36,272
- She's here to... She's here to fix...
- Who is she?

326
00:26:36,314 --> 00:26:39,067
- I'm trying to tell you...
- Who is the little piece of meat?

327
00:26:39,154 --> 00:26:42,271
<i>She's a friend of, of,
the guy who was here to...</i>

328
00:26:42,354 --> 00:26:46,108
- Jesus, at least lie quickly!
- I am trying to.

329
00:26:46,194 --> 00:26:51,632
Look, you gotta believe me.
This is perfectly innocent.

330
00:27:05,034 --> 00:27:06,911
Hey, hey, hey.

331
00:27:06,994 --> 00:27:09,224
<i>I'm sick of this shit,
you know that?</i>

332
00:27:09,274 --> 00:27:11,834
- I am doing you a favor here.
- Doing me a favor?

333
00:27:11,914 --> 00:27:15,065
- I gave you...
- Yeah, you gave, I gave. Big deal!

334
00:27:15,154 --> 00:27:17,714
<i>Somebody told me we look
ridiculous together.</i>

335
00:27:17,794 --> 00:27:20,103
<i>How do you think
that makes me feel?</i>

336
00:27:20,194 --> 00:27:22,424
You never think
about my feelings.

337
00:27:22,514 --> 00:27:25,711
<i>Go find someone
your own age, Madeline!</i>

338
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:32,703
Madeline! I need to speak
to Madeline at once!

339
00:28:33,794 --> 00:28:35,944
No.

340
00:28:38,874 --> 00:28:42,992
Madeline. I need to speak
to Madeline at once!

341
00:28:43,034 --> 00:28:45,025
Yeah.

342
00:29:23,634 --> 00:29:26,023
Geez.

343
00:29:43,714 --> 00:29:47,184
- Good evening. I hope it's not too...
- Not at all, Miss Ashton.

344
00:29:47,274 --> 00:29:49,868
Miss Von Rhuman's expecting you.

345
00:29:49,914 --> 00:29:52,189
She is?

346
00:30:01,234 --> 00:30:03,794
Wait here, please.

347
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:31,872
<i>Follow me, please.</i>

348
00:30:58,834 --> 00:31:01,792
Excuse me.

349
00:31:03,554 --> 00:31:06,193
I hoped you'd come.

350
00:31:06,234 --> 00:31:10,466
Make some room for my friend,
for Christ's sake!

351
00:31:10,514 --> 00:31:12,505
But...

352
00:31:15,034 --> 00:31:17,468
keep your ass handy.

353
00:31:25,834 --> 00:31:30,988
<i>May I say that
I've always thought yours...</i>

354
00:31:31,074 --> 00:31:35,829
to be one of the most
beautiful faces...

355
00:31:35,914 --> 00:31:39,304
ever to grace
the silver screen.

356
00:31:39,354 --> 00:31:40,582
Oh.

357
00:31:40,634 --> 00:31:42,750
And that husband of yours,

358
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:46,713
I can only say that
his reputation is unsurpassed.

359
00:31:46,794 --> 00:31:48,625
Oh.

360
00:31:48,714 --> 00:31:53,071
<i>I just arrived in town.
I follow the spring.</i>

361
00:31:53,114 --> 00:31:55,423
<i>I haven't seen an autumn
or winter in years.</i>

362
00:31:58,234 --> 00:32:00,702
We are creatures
of the spring, you and I.

363
00:32:00,754 --> 00:32:05,191
<i>Uh-huh. I'm not really
quite sure why I came.</i>

364
00:32:05,234 --> 00:32:08,431
You're scared as hell...
of yourself,

365
00:32:09,554 --> 00:32:13,069
<i>of the body you thought
you once knew.</i>

366
00:32:13,114 --> 00:32:15,548
I beg your pardon?

367
00:32:16,594 --> 00:32:19,950
<i>I am the one
who understands.</i>

368
00:32:20,034 --> 00:32:23,663
<i>I am the one
who knows your secret.</i>

369
00:32:25,794 --> 00:32:27,864
Who is it?

370
00:32:30,994 --> 00:32:34,350
Madeline.
I need to speak to Madeline.

371
00:32:34,394 --> 00:32:36,544
She's not here.

372
00:32:36,594 --> 00:32:39,631
Ah, thank God!

373
00:32:43,994 --> 00:32:47,703
<i>How did you get in?
I didn't hear the gate.</i>

374
00:32:49,794 --> 00:32:52,388
<i>I didn't want you to hear.</i>

375
00:32:52,434 --> 00:32:54,504
Ernest, ask me to go.

376
00:32:54,554 --> 00:32:57,307
Ask me to leave
this house immediately!

377
00:32:57,394 --> 00:33:00,067
<i>- You just got here.
- I know, I know.</i>

378
00:33:00,114 --> 00:33:03,629
<i>But it just took me a glimpse
and I was back where I started.</i>

379
00:33:03,674 --> 00:33:05,869
Where's that?

380
00:33:05,914 --> 00:33:09,111
<i>- Don't pretend you're not aware of it.
- Of what?</i>

381
00:33:09,194 --> 00:33:13,392
<i>You're a powerful
sexual being, Ernest.</i>

382
00:33:13,474 --> 00:33:15,146
I am?

383
00:33:15,194 --> 00:33:16,912
Yes, you are.

384
00:33:16,994 --> 00:33:19,986
If I never told you before,
it's because...

385
00:33:20,074 --> 00:33:23,350
<i>I wasn't the sort of girl
that could say the word...</i>

386
00:33:23,434 --> 00:33:26,824
<i>"sexual" without blushing.</i>

387
00:33:29,514 --> 00:33:31,903
<i>Well, I can now.</i>

388
00:33:33,554 --> 00:33:36,432
Sexual.

389
00:33:37,154 --> 00:33:39,622
Sensual.

390
00:33:41,114 --> 00:33:43,184
Sexy.

391
00:33:44,594 --> 00:33:47,267
Sex.

392
00:33:47,314 --> 00:33:50,192
Sex.

393
00:33:50,234 --> 00:33:52,190
Sex!

394
00:33:55,874 --> 00:34:00,265
<i>So warm, so full of life.</i>

395
00:34:00,354 --> 00:34:04,347
<i>And already
it ebbs away from you.</i>

396
00:34:04,434 --> 00:34:07,426
This is life's
ultimate cruelty.

397
00:34:07,474 --> 00:34:10,989
It offers us the taste
of youth and vitality...

398
00:34:11,074 --> 00:34:14,953
<i>and then makes us
witness our own decay.</i>

399
00:34:16,234 --> 00:34:18,464
<i>Well, it is
the natural law.</i>

400
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:20,903
<i>Screw the natural law!</i>

401
00:35:12,274 --> 00:35:14,708
What is that?

402
00:35:14,794 --> 00:35:18,833
What you came for.

403
00:35:18,914 --> 00:35:21,792
A touch of magic...

404
00:35:21,874 --> 00:35:25,992
<i>in this world
obsessed with science.</i>

405
00:35:27,754 --> 00:35:30,063
A tonic.

406
00:35:31,634 --> 00:35:33,864
A potion.

407
00:35:35,514 --> 00:35:37,391
What does it do?

408
00:35:37,474 --> 00:35:40,830
<i>How old would you guess I am?</i>

409
00:35:43,634 --> 00:35:46,592
<i>I wouldn't...</i>

410
00:35:46,674 --> 00:35:49,313
Come on.
Don't try to flatter me.

411
00:35:49,394 --> 00:35:51,783
Thirty eight.

412
00:35:52,754 --> 00:35:54,745
<i>Oh, twenty eight.
Twenty... three?</i>

413
00:35:54,834 --> 00:35:58,349
I am seventy-one years old.

414
00:35:58,434 --> 00:36:01,631
<i>That's what it does.</i>

415
00:36:01,714 --> 00:36:05,024
It stops the aging process
dead in its tracks...

416
00:36:05,074 --> 00:36:07,224
and forces it into retreat.

417
00:36:07,314 --> 00:36:11,865
<i>Drink that potion and you'll
never grow even one day older.</i>

418
00:36:11,954 --> 00:36:17,074
<i>Don't drink it...
and continue to watch yourself rot.</i>

419
00:36:17,914 --> 00:36:19,791
<i>How much is it?</i>

420
00:36:22,234 --> 00:36:26,022
The sordid topic of coin...

421
00:36:26,074 --> 00:36:28,713
I'm afraid is not so simple.

422
00:36:28,754 --> 00:36:32,952
The cost, you see,
it's different for everyone.

423
00:36:33,034 --> 00:36:36,185
<i>Well, for me, how much?</i>

424
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:55,749
Well, thank you very much.
I think I should be going.

425
00:36:55,794 --> 00:36:57,944
Sit!

426
00:37:12,274 --> 00:37:14,993
Hold out your hand.

427
00:37:18,514 --> 00:37:21,950
What are you, nuts?

428
00:37:22,034 --> 00:37:24,104
Watch.

429
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:52,143
Check okay?

430
00:37:52,234 --> 00:37:54,065
Fine.

431
00:37:54,154 --> 00:37:56,668
But you must make me a promise.

432
00:37:56,754 --> 00:37:59,473
<i>The secret that we share
must never become public.</i>

433
00:37:59,554 --> 00:38:02,068
You may continue your career
for ten years,

434
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:05,226
ten years of perfect,
unchanged beauty.

435
00:38:05,314 --> 00:38:09,830
But at the end of that time,
before people become suspicious,

436
00:38:09,874 --> 00:38:12,672
<i>you have to disappear
from public view forever.</i>

437
00:38:12,754 --> 00:38:14,824
You can retire.

438
00:38:14,914 --> 00:38:18,031
<i>You can stage
your own phony death...</i>

439
00:38:18,074 --> 00:38:20,542
or...

440
00:38:20,594 --> 00:38:23,984
as one of my clients
simply said,

441
00:38:24,074 --> 00:38:26,827
"I vant to be alone, yah."

442
00:38:26,914 --> 00:38:29,712
No! She's not!

443
00:38:30,834 --> 00:38:32,711
<i>Wow!</i>

444
00:38:57,914 --> 00:39:00,428
Bottoms up.

445
00:39:12,994 --> 00:39:16,907
<i>- Now, a warning.
- Now, a warning?</i>

446
00:39:16,994 --> 00:39:20,350
Take care of yourself.

447
00:39:20,434 --> 00:39:25,952
You and your body are going
to be together a long time.

448
00:39:26,034 --> 00:39:28,594
Be good to it.

449
00:39:30,234 --> 00:39:33,988
Siempre viva.
Live forever.

450
00:40:13,314 --> 00:40:17,273
I can't believe...
Did you...

451
00:40:17,354 --> 00:40:20,027
Oh... I'm a girl!

452
00:40:20,114 --> 00:40:23,265
Shh.

453
00:40:23,314 --> 00:40:26,511
<i>Ernest, oh, we gotta stop.</i>

454
00:40:26,594 --> 00:40:28,983
<i>I know we... I know we...</i>

455
00:40:29,074 --> 00:40:31,304
Really, Ernest. Oh.

456
00:40:31,394 --> 00:40:33,783
<i>Ernest, don't be angry with me.</i>

457
00:40:33,874 --> 00:40:37,071
I'm fighting this as hard
as I can, but just...

458
00:40:37,154 --> 00:40:38,746
Look at you!

459
00:40:41,074 --> 00:40:43,747
She's already destroyed
your career.

460
00:40:43,794 --> 00:40:46,308
<i>Now she's breaking
your heart,</i>

461
00:40:46,354 --> 00:40:48,993
stealing your pride,

462
00:40:49,074 --> 00:40:51,304
flaunting her lovers...

463
00:40:51,394 --> 00:40:52,668
<i>all over town.</i>

464
00:40:52,754 --> 00:40:54,585
<i>You know about that?</i>

465
00:40:54,674 --> 00:40:58,144
Everyone does.

466
00:40:58,194 --> 00:41:01,664
At the party,
people spoke of nothing else.

467
00:41:01,714 --> 00:41:04,433
<i>How can you love me, Helen?</i>

468
00:41:04,474 --> 00:41:08,672
<i>I've been so weak for so long.</i>

469
00:41:08,754 --> 00:41:12,224
I should've divorced Madeline
a long time ago.

470
00:41:14,474 --> 00:41:18,262
<i>By God, that is exactly
what I am going to do!</i>

471
00:41:18,354 --> 00:41:20,424
<i>The first thing
tomorrow morning,</i>

472
00:41:20,514 --> 00:41:23,790
<i>I am gonna go downtown and obtain
a divorce from Madeline Ashton.</i>

473
00:41:23,874 --> 00:41:27,628
- Ernest?
- Monday. At the very least Tuesday.

474
00:41:27,714 --> 00:41:31,389
Divorce?
In California?

475
00:41:31,474 --> 00:41:35,183
<i>That's exactly what
she wants you to do.</i>

476
00:41:35,274 --> 00:41:37,504
You have no talent
for poverty.

477
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:46,307
<i>You can't let her
get away with that.</i>

478
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:50,626
Then there's nothing
I can do.

479
00:41:52,434 --> 00:41:54,948
Oh, yes, there is.

480
00:41:58,954 --> 00:42:01,263
Listen to me, Ernest.

481
00:42:01,354 --> 00:42:05,711
<i>I've thought this through carefully,
and it's the only way.</i>

482
00:42:05,794 --> 00:42:09,389
<i>Tonight, while she's asleep,
you'll sneak downstairs quietly,</i>

483
00:42:09,434 --> 00:42:13,905
<i>and take one of each kind
of wine glass from the shelf.</i>

484
00:42:13,994 --> 00:42:16,303
Then you'll take
this Narconal...

485
00:42:16,394 --> 00:42:18,669
and lightly coat
each glass.

486
00:42:18,754 --> 00:42:22,667
<i>As you know, Narconal is a very
powerful alcohol-base tranquilizer,</i>

487
00:42:22,714 --> 00:42:24,591
<i>so you won't need much.</i>

488
00:42:24,674 --> 00:42:27,234
<i>Tomorrow, I'll call Madeline
to say good-bye.</i>

489
00:42:27,314 --> 00:42:32,024
- I'll get her to invite me to dinner.
- Why don't you come to dinner?

490
00:42:32,114 --> 00:42:35,948
<i>Then, at dinner,
we propose a toast.</i>

491
00:42:35,994 --> 00:42:38,189
<i>No matter which glass
she drinks from,</i>

492
00:42:38,234 --> 00:42:42,227
<i>Narconal will be
on the glass.</i>

493
00:42:42,314 --> 00:42:45,590
<i>You and I work together.
First, we finish dinner.</i>

494
00:42:45,674 --> 00:42:48,905
<i>Then we load her in the car,
take her to the top of Mulholland Drive,</i>

495
00:42:48,954 --> 00:42:53,903
<i>call the police and report we've seen a
drunk woman swerving close to the edge.</i>

496
00:42:53,994 --> 00:42:57,384
<i>Some drunk woman up here on Mulholland's
swerving dangerously close to the edge.</i>

497
00:42:57,474 --> 00:43:00,989
We'll sit her up
in the driver's seat...

498
00:43:01,074 --> 00:43:02,826
and make it look like
she's had...

499
00:43:02,914 --> 00:43:06,702
just a little bit
too much to drink.

500
00:43:06,794 --> 00:43:08,910
We drop the car into gear,

501
00:43:10,594 --> 00:43:13,313
<i>wedge her foot
down on the accelerator,</i>

502
00:43:14,834 --> 00:43:17,712
<i>clamp her hands
on the steering wheel...</i>

503
00:43:17,794 --> 00:43:20,592
<i>and send her on her way.</i>

504
00:43:31,074 --> 00:43:33,872
By the time
they perform the autopsy,

505
00:43:33,914 --> 00:43:36,474
<i>the Narconal will be
completely dissolved,</i>

506
00:43:36,554 --> 00:43:39,193
leaving only traces
of alcohol.

507
00:43:39,274 --> 00:43:43,506
She'll be classified
as just another drunk driver.

508
00:43:43,594 --> 00:43:48,907
- They'll check her blood alcohol...
- Point four-0. She had it coming.

509
00:43:48,954 --> 00:43:51,309
...and think
nothing more of it.

510
00:43:51,394 --> 00:43:55,910
The case is closed.
Madeline is dead.

511
00:43:55,954 --> 00:43:59,390
<i>And we're free!</i>

512
00:43:59,474 --> 00:44:02,147
<i>What are we saying?</i>

513
00:44:08,234 --> 00:44:11,988
<i>- We can't go through with this, Helen.
- It's the only way.</i>

514
00:44:12,074 --> 00:44:14,224
After she's gone,

515
00:44:14,314 --> 00:44:17,511
you can start your life
all over again.

516
00:44:17,554 --> 00:44:20,751
I can start my life
all over again.

517
00:44:20,834 --> 00:44:25,066
<i>Oh, we'll be so happy!</i>

518
00:44:27,634 --> 00:44:30,626
She's killing you.

519
00:44:32,274 --> 00:44:36,028
<i>So... it would be
self-defense.</i>

520
00:44:36,114 --> 00:44:39,470
Self-defense.

521
00:46:06,554 --> 00:46:09,864
My God, it's back!

522
00:46:19,034 --> 00:46:21,229
We have to talk.

523
00:46:21,274 --> 00:46:24,505
- Have another drink and go to bed.
- You'd like that.

524
00:46:24,594 --> 00:46:27,631
You'd like to see me drink
myself into an early grave.

525
00:46:27,674 --> 00:46:29,983
That is not going
to happen, by God!

526
00:46:30,034 --> 00:46:34,152
- You are not going to take my money!
- What are you talking about?

527
00:46:34,194 --> 00:46:37,311
<i>When was the last time
you worked, Madeline? A real job?</i>

528
00:46:37,394 --> 00:46:41,546
<i>Anything you had left, you owed me
a long time ago. Your face owed me.</i>

529
00:46:41,634 --> 00:46:44,023
You've changed your hair?

530
00:46:46,274 --> 00:46:48,265
What an eye.

531
00:46:48,354 --> 00:46:50,185
<i>Don't wait up.</i>

532
00:46:52,354 --> 00:46:54,549
Cheap.

533
00:46:57,354 --> 00:46:59,663
What did you say?

534
00:46:59,754 --> 00:47:02,507
<i>I called you cheap.
That's what I think of you.</i>

535
00:47:02,594 --> 00:47:04,550
Who do you think
you're talking to?

536
00:47:04,594 --> 00:47:07,154
You're a cheap,
tacky little tramp.

537
00:47:07,234 --> 00:47:09,429
Who do you think
you are?

538
00:47:09,514 --> 00:47:12,745
<i>- Nothing like the woman I married.
- You're nothing!</i>

539
00:47:12,834 --> 00:47:16,190
<i>- You're a broad!
- You're a tragic, boozy, flaccid clown.</i>

540
00:47:16,274 --> 00:47:19,949
- Watch it, Madeline.
- That's it. Flaccid.

541
00:47:19,994 --> 00:47:21,950
<i>- Watch what you say.
- Flaccid.</i>

542
00:47:22,034 --> 00:47:24,502
I don't have to take
this any longer!

543
00:47:24,594 --> 00:47:27,347
<i>You'll take everything I have to give!
You always have.</i>

544
00:47:27,434 --> 00:47:29,743
You're not even a man anymore.
And I need a man!

545
00:47:29,834 --> 00:47:33,793
<i>A real man, not some drunken,
broken-down flaccid undertaker...</i>

546
00:47:33,874 --> 00:47:36,911
<i>who is just as dead below
the waist as his clients are.</i>

547
00:47:36,954 --> 00:47:39,627
<i>Hey, I might have more fun
with one of your clients!</i>

548
00:47:39,674 --> 00:47:42,984
<i>At least I'd know I'd be
getting something stiff...</i>

549
00:47:59,234 --> 00:48:02,067
<i>Did you think that I was just going
to take it forever, Madeline?</i>

550
00:48:02,154 --> 00:48:03,587
Did you?

551
00:48:03,634 --> 00:48:06,706
You cruel, vicious,
loathsome bitch!

552
00:48:10,994 --> 00:48:14,111
Please? Please?

553
00:48:16,674 --> 00:48:19,711
Oh, God! Oh!

554
00:48:19,794 --> 00:48:23,628
- Madeline, I'm so sorry.
- Oh, help me! Help me!

555
00:48:26,114 --> 00:48:28,309
Hurry!

556
00:48:28,394 --> 00:48:30,464
<i>Help me!
Hurry up, you wimp!</i>

557
00:48:53,554 --> 00:48:55,465
Oh, boy.

558
00:49:01,434 --> 00:49:04,949
Oh, oh.

559
00:49:05,034 --> 00:49:06,990
Oh.

560
00:49:09,474 --> 00:49:12,352
Oh, boy!

561
00:49:38,434 --> 00:49:40,709
Oh, boy!

562
00:49:51,074 --> 00:49:53,190
Suite 1110, please.

563
00:49:53,234 --> 00:49:55,953
Helen, it's me, Ernest Menville!
I did it!

564
00:49:56,034 --> 00:49:58,229
I didn't think I'd be able to,
but I did it!

565
00:49:58,314 --> 00:50:01,306
<i>I pushed her down the stairs.
She is absolutely stone cold.</i>

566
00:50:01,394 --> 00:50:04,704
<i>She was saying the most
monstrous things and she's dead.</i>

567
00:50:04,754 --> 00:50:07,268
I just had this feeling inside
of me that I couldn't contain.

568
00:50:07,314 --> 00:50:09,953
We're free, Helen.
But I'm afraid I'm gonna burn in hell.

569
00:50:10,034 --> 00:50:12,753
Her neck is broken and
there's no pulse and she's dead.

570
00:50:12,834 --> 00:50:16,304
<i>Exactly which part of the plan
were you unclear on?</i>

571
00:50:16,394 --> 00:50:19,784
<i>- We went over it three times, Ernest.
- You don't understand.</i>

572
00:50:19,874 --> 00:50:23,549
<i>- Ernest, we went over it three times.
- You don't understand.</i>

573
00:50:23,634 --> 00:50:25,784
<i>It just happened.
It was an accident.</i>

574
00:50:25,874 --> 00:50:28,069
It's better than an accident. At least
it's gonna look like an accident.

575
00:50:28,114 --> 00:50:30,344
- Have you called the police?
- No, I called you first.

576
00:50:30,434 --> 00:50:33,710
<i>Ernest, you...
poor, sweet thing.</i>

577
00:50:33,754 --> 00:50:38,032
If the police check the phone records,
don't you think it'll look unusual...

578
00:50:38,114 --> 00:50:42,073
- That you called me before them?
- Oh, my God.

579
00:50:42,154 --> 00:50:44,543
- You're right.
- Of course I'm right!

580
00:50:44,594 --> 00:50:46,471
<i>- Should I call them right now?
- No.</i>

581
00:50:46,514 --> 00:50:49,984
<i>We have to decide what
you're going to say first.</i>

582
00:50:51,154 --> 00:50:53,588
- Well?
- I'm thinking.

583
00:50:54,714 --> 00:50:56,750
Okay, I've got it.
Where's the body?

584
00:50:56,834 --> 00:51:00,429
- At the foot of the stairs.
- Good. Don't move her.

585
00:51:00,514 --> 00:51:02,948
<i>- Soon as we hang up, call the police.
- Okay.</i>

586
00:51:02,994 --> 00:51:06,589
<i>Tell them you were on the phone with me
when you heard a terrible scream.</i>

587
00:51:06,674 --> 00:51:09,507
<i>You turned around and saw Madeline
fall down the stairs.</i>

588
00:51:09,554 --> 00:51:11,590
- Right. Perfect.
- Stick to that story.

589
00:51:11,634 --> 00:51:14,671
<i>If they check the phone records,
it'll confirm what you told them.</i>

590
00:51:14,754 --> 00:51:17,393
- Got it.
- What about the time of death?

591
00:51:17,474 --> 00:51:20,944
- Could they prove the call came after?
- No, no.

592
00:51:21,034 --> 00:51:23,992
<i>It's very difficult to determine
time of death within a few hours.</i>

593
00:51:24,074 --> 00:51:27,669
- It's not an exact science.
- Ernest? Ernest!

594
00:51:27,754 --> 00:51:32,145
<i>Ernest, you pushed me
down the stairs!</i>

595
00:51:37,314 --> 00:51:39,623
<i>Stay away from me!</i>

596
00:51:39,714 --> 00:51:42,228
<i>You bet I will!
Animal! Psycho!</i>

597
00:51:42,314 --> 00:51:45,192
- Don't come near me.
- Wife pusher!

598
00:51:45,234 --> 00:51:48,909
<i>Don't come near me,
follow me or talk to me.</i>

599
00:51:48,994 --> 00:51:51,189
I don't intend to.

600
00:51:51,634 --> 00:51:54,432
I just have to make
a telephone call.

601
00:51:57,754 --> 00:52:01,463
I just have to make
a telephone call.

602
00:52:01,554 --> 00:52:03,624
9-1-1, right?

603
00:52:06,714 --> 00:52:10,389
<i>You're in the shit house now, pal!</i>

604
00:52:11,394 --> 00:52:13,464
Madeline, look at yourself!

605
00:52:13,554 --> 00:52:16,273
- Huh?
- Look at yourself!

606
00:52:19,994 --> 00:52:22,189
Ernest!

607
00:52:22,274 --> 00:52:25,107
My ass!

608
00:52:25,194 --> 00:52:28,504
I can see...
my ass!

609
00:52:28,594 --> 00:52:33,349
<i>- Something's wrong with your neck too.
- I would say so.</i>

610
00:52:33,394 --> 00:52:37,945
<i>I would friggin' well say so!</i>

611
00:52:39,274 --> 00:52:42,186
Oh!
Are you okay, honey?

612
00:52:42,274 --> 00:52:44,947
Yeah. Oh.

613
00:52:48,594 --> 00:52:52,303
Ernest...

614
00:52:52,394 --> 00:52:54,589
<i>what's wrong with me?</i>

615
