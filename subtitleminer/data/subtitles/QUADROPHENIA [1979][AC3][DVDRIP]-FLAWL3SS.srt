You nicked 'em, didn't you?

812
00:53:25,098 --> 00:53:28,059
You're handling stolen goods.
I'll give you some more.

813

What about Pete, then?

815
00:53:48,802 --> 00:53:50,317
I'll worry about Pete.

816
00:53:51,044 --> 00:53:55,564
But if you tell him, I'll never
ever speak to you again, right?

817
00:53:59,052 --> 00:54:01,009
Don't worry. I won't tell him.

818
00:54:02,895 --> 00:54:05,617
And I'm still going down
to Brighton with him.

The only way you'll keep
that up is with lacquer.

842
00:55:16,728 --> 00:55:19,530
- No, no lacquer.
- Just a little?

843
00:55:19,612 --> 00:55:20,966
No, poofs wear lacquer.

844

I wear lacquer.

thing I haven't heard about?

Sopping wet trousers?

They're Levis.

Never mind what they are,
they're bleedin' wet!

Good morning, it's 6.01. Here
are the main points in the news.

899
00:57:59,288 --> 00:58:01,930
After yesterday's conference
session the Colonial Secretary

900
00:58:02,012 --> 00:58:06,088
commented that he hoped for
independence in Aden in a year.

901

The Bank Holiday started
in earnest last night,

902
00:58:08,977 --> 00:58:11,575
with motorists taking advantage
of the fine weather,

903
00:58:11,661 --> 00:58:13,301
heading towards
the South Coast resorts.

904
00:58:13,382 --> 00:58:16,583
Traffic was reported heavy on
the A127, the Southend road,

905
00:58:16,665 --> 00:58:20,502
and there were jams southbound
on the M1, causing long delays.

906
00:58:20,589 --> 00:58:23,152
Shopkeepers in the Brighton
area, fearing a reoccurrence

907
00:58:23,232 --> 00:58:26,432
of disturbances by groups of
rival youths in other resorts,

shutters last night.

01:30:57,358 --> 01:30:59,078
Another good customer
bites the dust.

1288
01:30:59,159 --> 01:31:02,872
We couldn't wait for you,
had to get back to our jobs.

1289
01:31:02,962 --> 01:31:06,403
Yeah, well, I ain't bothered.
I was with Ace and that.

1290
01:31:06,486 --> 01:31:08,639
Yeah, we went to court together.

1291
01:31:14,054 --> 01:31:15,010
Yeah.

1292
01:31:15,897 --> 01:31:16,852
Yeah.

1293
01:31:18,499 --> 01:31:20,695
Christ,
he's really weird tonight.

1294
01:31:20,780 --> 01:31:22,579
I couldn't give a shit.

1295
01:31:24,504 --> 01:31:25,460
Ferdy?

1296
01:31:25,947 --> 01:31:27,062
Jim?

1297
01:31:27,428 --> 01:31:28,908
You got any blues?

1298
01:31:28,988 --> 01:31:30,709
Yeah, how many you want?

1299
01:31:31,111 --> 01:31:32,704
Dunno. How many you got?

1300
01:31:32,792 --> 01:31:34,386
A ton. French blues.

1301
01:31:34,474 --> 01:31:35,591
I'll have the lot.

1302
01:31:35,676 --> 01:31:37,872
- What?
- You can't afford it!

1303
01:31:38,959 --> 01:31:40,791
Where'd you get all that, then?

1304
01:31:41,801 --> 01:31:43,395
Golden hand shake, innit?

1305
01:31:43,482 --> 01:31:44,837
Two weeks' money.

1306
01:31:44,923 --> 01:31:48,125
Told him to stuff the job
right up his arse.

1307
01:31:48,568 --> 01:31:50,959
[Ferdy]
You sure you want the whole bag?

1308
01:31:51,051 --> 01:31:53,169
Yeah. Why not, eh? Why not?

1309
01:31:53,252 --> 01:31:54,242
All right.

1310
01:31:54,334 --> 01:31:55,403
[Ferdy] A fiver.

1311
01:31:57,137 --> 01:31:58,173
Fiver.

1312
01:32:02,701 --> 01:32:04,854
What you gonna do with that lot?

1313
01:32:04,944 --> 01:32:06,902
Start a one-man riot?

1314
01:32:06,987 --> 01:32:08,056
Yeah. I might.

1315
01:32:09,629 --> 01:32:11,222
Why'd you chuck your job?

1316
01:32:11,310 --> 01:32:12,950
'Cos I felt like it.

1317
01:32:13,031 --> 01:32:14,706
Well, you're bleedin' nutty.

1318
01:32:14,793 --> 01:32:16,991
You was on a cushy number.

1319
01:32:17,077 --> 01:32:19,639
Look, don't give it
all that, right?

1320
01:32:19,719 --> 01:32:22,872
I just got fed up.
Fancied something outdoors.

1321
01:32:23,081 --> 01:32:24,436
So do I.

1322
01:32:26,486 --> 01:32:28,045
She's not bad, is she?

1323
01:32:28,127 --> 01:32:30,768
I found her by the road
in Brighton.

1324
01:33:09,247 --> 01:33:12,048
See you found yourself
a new little boy, then?

1325
01:33:15,293 --> 01:33:16,489
Hey, Jimmy?

1326
01:33:16,575 --> 01:33:18,533
Hope you find a new job.

1327
01:33:19,017 --> 01:33:20,292
0h, yeah?

1328
01:33:20,378 --> 01:33:23,453
I could get you a job
on the rubbish carts?

1329
01:33:24,862 --> 01:33:27,619
You're good at going
up and down in alleys.

1330
01:33:33,551 --> 01:33:35,508
[Shouting]

1331
01:33:41,038 --> 01:33:44,557
If I see you round 'ere again
I'll fuckin' kill you!

1332
01:33:44,641 --> 01:33:46,636
- Get off me!
- What's the matter?

1333
01:33:47,445 --> 01:33:48,595
You're not a face!

1334
01:33:48,687 --> 01:33:50,599
- Piss off!
- You piss off!

1335
01:33:50,688 --> 01:33:51,644
Forget her, Jimmy!

1336
01:33:51,729 --> 01:33:56,090
Shut up and piss off. You're all
wankers and cunts. Wankers!

1337
01:34:34,891 --> 01:34:36,724
[Knocks on door]

1338
01:34:40,698 --> 01:34:43,055
Jimmy!
Pack that in and clear off!

1339
01:34:43,139 --> 01:34:45,336
What d'you want,
you old spunker, eh?

1340
01:34:45,422 --> 01:34:49,180
[Shouts] Eh? What d'you
want? What d'you want?

1341
01:34:55,911 --> 01:34:58,031
I'll have you,
you little bastard!

1342
01:35:07,645 --> 01:35:08,795
[Mum] Are you mad?

1343
01:35:08,886 --> 01:35:11,642
What's the matter with you?
You're worse than he is!

1344
01:35:11,729 --> 01:35:12,684
Come on in!

1345
01:35:12,769 --> 01:35:14,568
[Dad]
You'll wake the whole street.

1346
01:35:14,651 --> 01:35:16,848
[Mum]
It's a bit late for that!

1347
01:35:16,933 --> 01:35:19,450
[Dad] If he comes
here again I'll kill him!

1348
01:35:19,536 --> 01:35:22,178
[Mum] Can't you
come in and talk about it?

1349
01:35:22,259 --> 01:35:24,570
Do they all have to know
our business?

1350
01:35:50,727 --> 01:35:52,081
[Dad coughs]

1351
01:36:56,110 --> 01:36:57,147
Hello, Steph.

1352
01:36:57,512 --> 01:36:59,152
What you doin' here?

1353
01:36:59,955 --> 01:37:01,390
I wanted to see you.

1354
01:37:01,476 --> 01:37:02,705
You've seen me, 0K?

1355
01:37:02,798 --> 01:37:04,597
Wait a minute, will ya?

1356
01:37:04,679 --> 01:37:06,797
What you gonna do? Beat me up?

1357
01:37:06,881 --> 01:37:09,000
What d'you want?
Come on, I'm late.

1358
01:37:10,205 --> 01:37:13,724
Well... I left home last night.

1359
01:37:13,808 --> 01:37:15,801
I kipped out, didn't I?

1360
01:37:15,890 --> 01:37:17,245
In some nuthouse?

1361
01:37:17,332 --> 01:37:19,052
Look, I ain't mad!

1362
01:37:19,134 --> 01:37:21,525
What is wrong with you, then?

1363
01:37:21,616 --> 01:37:22,606
Well, I dunno.

1364
01:37:22,697 --> 01:37:26,136
It's just...it seems like
everything's going backwards.

1365
01:37:26,220 --> 01:37:27,176
Steph?

1366
01:37:28,343 --> 01:37:31,702
You sure it's not you
going backwards?

1367
01:37:31,787 --> 01:37:35,384
No, it's just... I can't
think straight, that's all.

1368
01:37:35,469 --> 01:37:38,864
I mean, nothing seems right,
apart from Brighton.

1369
01:37:38,953 --> 01:37:43,075
Brighton was 0K, going to court
with the Ace and that.

1370
01:37:43,157 --> 01:37:45,593
I was a mod there, you know?

1371
01:37:45,680 --> 01:37:47,592
I mean, that's something,
innit, eh?

1372
01:37:47,681 --> 01:37:49,800
What are you talkin' about?

1373
01:37:49,884 --> 01:37:52,640
Brighton was a laugh,
that's why we went down there.

1374
01:37:53,527 --> 01:37:58,083
0h, yeah. And me and you, then?
Was that just a giggle?

1375
01:37:58,171 --> 01:37:59,652
0h, what do you think?

1376
01:38:00,855 --> 01:38:02,448
All right, so I fancied you.

1377
01:38:02,537 --> 01:38:05,417
We had it off.
But that don't mean nothin'.

1378
01:38:05,499 --> 01:38:07,173
It did to fuckin' me.

1379
01:38:07,261 --> 01:38:09,174
I can't help that, can I?

1380
01:38:09,263 --> 01:38:11,733
If I'd known you'd go mad,
I wouldn't have.

1381
01:38:11,825 --> 01:38:14,422
I told you, I ain't
fuckin' mad, right?

1382
01:38:14,508 --> 01:38:16,148
No, not much. Look at you?

1383
01:38:16,229 --> 01:38:19,305
0ne minute you're all right,
next minute you're going stupid.

1384
01:38:19,394 --> 01:38:22,867
You can't have a bit without
kicking your mates' head in.

1385
01:38:22,956 --> 01:38:25,473
Just leave me alone,
Jimmy! All right?

1386
01:38:25,559 --> 01:38:27,916
Steph, please. Steph, please!

1387
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:29,356

1395
01:38:55,548 --> 01:38:56,664
Look at this.

1396
01:38:56,749 --> 01:39:01,111
Ah, fuckin' hell!

It's on the floor now.
