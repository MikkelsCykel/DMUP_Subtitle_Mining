00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:37,153
- Ten and a half!
- Nine fifty!

2
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:43,327
- Twenty-five!
- I'll take it!

3
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:49,163
- How's July? July how?
- July's at 95 and a quarter.

4
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:51,203
Ninety-four and a half bid.
Hey, bonehead, moron!

5
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:55,967
- Moron? Moron this. At 95. At 95.
- Keep your pencil to yourself!

6
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:59,307
- 94 and 3 quarter bid for 300.
- Sold, 300!

7
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:04,816
- Buy 300, yes!
- 300, you idiot? Get out of my way.

8
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:11,857
300 lots of coffee futures?
You call that a hunch?

9
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:15,392
No, Richard. I call
that an opportunity.

10
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:19,055
300 lots in this market is not
an opportunity. It's a death wish.

11
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,362
- Oh, ye of little faith.
- No, no, no. Me of big mortgage.

12
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:26,336
- Hi, Maddy. What've you got?
- Flight 109 leaving J.F.K., 1:00 p. m.,

13
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:28,498
arriving Caracas
at 6:22 p. m.

14
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:30,508
- All right, all right.
- Aw, come on.

15
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,010
You're not still leaving,
after what you did in there?

16
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:37,515
I'm getting married to Charlotte.
I need the divorce from Patricia.

17
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:39,517
- Toiletries, shirts, socks-
- I don't believe this.

18
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:42,747
You're gonna leave me
with 5,100 tons of coffee?

19
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:47,690
Richard, I put up with you because
you're the best analyst on the Street.

20
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:49,352
You give me that same
patronizing little speech...

21
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:51,760
every time you play
one of your stupid hunches.

22
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:55,595
- Yeah? And what happens?
- I'm hospitalized, and the blood pressure medication is adjusted.

23
00:03:55,802 --> 00:04:00,364
Uplink. You'll overnight in Caracas,
then fly to Canaima the next morning.

24
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:03,033
Thanks.
See ya in two days.

25
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:07,442
Unbelievable.

26
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:24,463
This thing might be quicker
if you used both engines!

27
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:28,055
Senor Kromwell?

28
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:31,694
Senor Kromwell?

29
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:34,432
That'd be me, Michael Cromwell,
with a "C."

30
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:38,738
Senor Cromwell with a "C." I am Abe
Botero with a "B," your attorney-at-law.

31
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:43,111
I am outrageously pleased
to meet with you.

32
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:45,444
Abe, Abe.
Let me go.

33
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:48,452
My car is right over here.
Do you have any more luggage?

34
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:52,547
I travel kinda light, Abe. So,
what's the deal? Where is Patricia?

35
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:56,220
Uh, we received this letter
from your wife today.

36
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:59,230
Senora Cromwell says that
she could not come to Canaima,

37
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:01,664
- but she wants to get you to Lipo Lipo.
- Wait a second.

38
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:05,931
I travel 3,000 miles to get here. She
doesn't show up? What's that about?

39
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:08,769
Abe has a saying:

40
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,571
He who knows what a woman wants,
knows everything,

41
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:14,613
but not even God
knows that.

42
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:19,083
Okay. If that's the way she wants
to play it, she's not gonna get a dime.

43
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:29,927
If Cromwell should bother
to call, put him through to my office!

44
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:33,328
Has anybody seen that idiot Kempster
around here?

45
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:35,331
Kempster!

46
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:37,959
Michael, you have got
to get back here tomorrow.

47
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:40,130
Langston is going insane.
Where are you?

48
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:43,470
- I'm staying in the middle
of Nightmare on Bodega Street.

49
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:46,977
If you don't get here,
do I sell the coffee or do I hold it?

50
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,641
No, no, no, no. Do not sell the coffee
till I give you the go-ahead.

51
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,150
Call me on the uplink
as soon as London opens, all right?

52
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:56,221
- All right. Okay.
- Kempster!

53
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:27,685
Nah, I wouldn't do that.

54
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:30,483
Oh, and why not?

55
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:34,185
Oh!

56
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:06,124
Lipo Lipo. So nice
they named it twice.

57
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:11,354
Oh, my God.

58
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:13,557
She left me
for Gilligan's Island!

59
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:23,375
- Great. I'll be right back.
- Not long. I have an appointment.

60
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:28,038
You have an appointment? Well, if it's
the cable guy, you got plenty of time.

61
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:29,273
- Okay.
- Hi, um-

62
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:34,443
I'm-I'm Michael Cromwell. I'm
looking for Patricia Cromwell.

63
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:37,579
You know Patricia Cromwell?

64
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:40,090
She's a doctor.

65
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:44,323
No, a woman. Like me, but, but...

66
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,329
full-figured.

67
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,434
Paliku.

68
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:50,764
- Paliku.
- Pali who?

69
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,805
- Paliku.
- Paliku?

70
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,341
- Where is she?
- Paliku.

71
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,605
- Paliku! Paliku!
- Yes, I heard you. Okay, okay.

72
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,683
Patricia.

73
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,084
Mmm.

74
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:12,453
You look different.

75
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:16,422
Michael.
You made it.

76
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:19,292
Um, yes, I did.

77
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:32,108
You look good.

78
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:34,145
So do you.

79
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:36,841
- How've you been?
- Better. Much better.

80
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:39,611
Weren't you supposed
to meet me in Canaima last night?

81
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,983
Botako's having
her first litter.

82
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:44,716
- Congratulations.
- Not her.

83
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:48,623
This is Pontspie. Pontspie,

84
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:50,628
Mmm.

85
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:54,491
This is Botako.

86
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,865
As much as I hate
to spoil this joyous event,

87
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:00,632
I took an airplane from New York City.
I have a boat waiting.

88
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,231
You remember the divorce? Patricia?

89
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:06,004
- Patricia!
- Paliku.

90
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:09,138
My Pinare name is Paliku.
We pick our own names here.

91
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:13,685
Do you remember 12, 13 years ago,
maybe, when out of the blue,

92
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:17,244
we weren't even married a year,
and you walked out on me.

93
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,518
And now you want a divorce, and you
think I'm gonna hit you up for money.

94
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:23,094
We both want a divorce,
and aren't you?

95
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:27,859
- I don't want any money.
- Great! We can get to Caracas now.

96
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:31,334
That way we can sign divorce papers.
I can be back in New York by Friday.

97
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:34,838
Tomorrow is the Fanenteyou celebration.
I have to be here.

98
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:38,709
- Ooh.
- It's a male!

99
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:41,006
Ay!

100
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:43,946
As much as I'd like to stick around
for the circumcision,

101
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,779
I've got a canoe waiting,
and my boatman has an appointment.

102
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:53,187
- Your boatman is gone.
- What?

103
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:55,226
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Tell him to stop!

104
00:09:55,328 --> 00:10:00,527
- Hasta la vista.
- Hey, stop! You can't leave me here!

105
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:04,467
What you're doing is
very unprofessional!

106
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:15,238
Oh, no.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

107
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:18,078
Come back here!
Hey, hey, hey!

108
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:21,585
I'm gonna need all these clothes back,
right where they came from, all right?

109
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:24,212
Aw, this is a Braun!

110
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,991
- What about my boat?
- He'll be back. Couple of days.

111
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,065
Wh-What am I supposed
to do now?

112
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,600
The chief says you can spend the night
with the bachelors.

113
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:41,162
- I'm not staying with the bachelors.
- Or Pontspie offered her hut.

114
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,935
Mm-mmm.

115
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:47,274
Bring on the bachelors.

116
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,655
Come on, come on,
come on.

117
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:11,793
- Hungry?
- I am starving. Oh.

118
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:14,840
It's yellow-eared bat, a Pinare
specialty. It's made from the bladder.

119
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:18,933
Oh, bat bladder.
Holy Kaopectate! I don't think so.

120
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:23,877
- You might prefer the kara toka.
- Yeah, right.

121
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:28,510
- Chicken.
- I would prefer that. Thanks. Ready.

122
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:30,686
Excuse me.

123
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:34,520
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Michael, I have to talk to you.

124
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:38,687
- Patricia, let's not, okay?
- There's something that you don't know.

125
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:40,856
Yeah, like why
you left me.

126
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,302
- Because of the fifth phone line.
- What is that supposed to mean?

127
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:50,364
One morning some guy showed up at our
apartment to install a fifth phone line.

128
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:52,875
He asked if I was the receptionist.

129
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:55,139
And I realized that
I had lost you somehow.

130
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:59,183
I packed my things and I left you alone.
I figured you'd be happier that way.

131
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:02,345
- You thought this would make me happy?
- How long before you noticed I was gone?

132
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:04,355
- Why didn't you talk to me?
- Talk to you?

133
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:06,357
I spent six months
telling you I was unhappy.

134
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:09,223
It was a crazy time for me.
I just started working at L.T.G.

135
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:11,226
- Michael.
- I had a straddled position in sugar.

136
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:13,490
The price went up,
it skyrocketed, I'm shorted-

137
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:15,499
- Michael. Michael!
- What?

138
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:18,069
It's very hard for me
to tell you this, so please listen.

139
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:21,401
What choice do I have? I'm stuck here
with you and the Village People...

140
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,031
till you celebrate
Banana-fana-fo-fana.

141
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:28,239
- Hello, you.
- Ohhh.

142
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,349
Excuse me.
The real world calls.

143
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:34,916
Hello, you.

144
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:46,421
What I'm trying
to say is that-

145
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:49,227
- Look, I was right. I was right!
- I wasn't exactly alone when I left you.

146
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:52,361
- 97 and a quarter.
- Michael. Michael.

147
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:54,405
I'm with ya.
Coffee has gone crazy.

148
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:57,442
- I didn't know it, but I was...
- 97 and a quarter, 97, 97-

149
00:12:57,576 --> 00:13:00,943
- I'm gonna wait till 97 and a half.
- pregnant with your son.

150
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:05,710
'Cause it's gonna happen. Waitin'. Papa
is waitin'. Come to Papa, 97 and a half.

151
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:11,415
Sold for a tidy $300,000 profit.
God, it's good to be good!

152
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:14,789
- What'd she say?
- Hello, you.

153
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:16,792
Patricia-

154
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:20,831
All right, Patricia. What did I do?

155
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:24,458
I just told you that you had a son,
and you didn't even hear me.

156
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:27,902
- What are you talking about? What son?
- Your son.

157
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:31,465
The boy sitting next to the fire
over there is your son.

158
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:48,482
That is my son?

159
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:55,456
I must have started
a thousand letters to tell you,

160
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:58,332
but every one of them started with,
"I know you never wanted children. "

161
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,631
This is nuts. This is nuts.
This is unbelievable.

162
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:03,503
- I was confused-
- This is unforgivable!

163
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:07,169
I'm not asking you to forgive me, but he
didn't do anything, so don't blame him.

164
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:26,691
That's my son?

165
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,365
His name is Mimi Siku.

166
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:40,706
His name is what?

167
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:42,814
Mimi Siku.

168
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:45,213
Mimi Siku.

169
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:48,377
Roughly translated,
it means...

170
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,546
"Cat Piss. "

171
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:55,023
- He picked the name "Cat Piss"?
- He was six years old at the time.

172
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:57,152
It's a territorial thing.

173
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:59,231
- You sure he's mine?
- Positive.

174
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:02,994
He's got your nose,
and he thinks he's never wrong.

175
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:05,832
Hello, you.

176
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:08,566
No, no, no! Get away!
No! Don't touch that!

177
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:10,937
Don't touch that!
No, don't touch that!

178
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:12,941
Huh?

179
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:18,080
Oh.

180
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:22,682
You wouldn't happen to have a place
where I could stick that, would you?

181
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:25,916
Hello, you.

182
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:42,437
Talk about
your wind instruments.

183
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:50,976
Oh!

184
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:54,051
Oh, ease up on the fruit,
for God's sakes.

185
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,446
Mitsubishi!

186
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,558
Mimi Siku.

187
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:07,962
Hi, uh, Mimi Siku.
I'm Michael Cromwell.

188
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:12,662
Patricia- Paliku
tells me that, um,

189
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:17,003
that I'm your father.

190
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:21,168
That's a nice pot you have.

191
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,508
Do you understand
any English?

192
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:31,156
Well, Patricia- or Paliku- wanted me
to say something paternal to you.

193
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:34,919
I gotta admit, this isn't easy for me.
I don't have any regrets.

194
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:37,621
Well, I have regrets.

195
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:40,130
But then again-
# Too few to mention ## Ha!

196
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:31,712
Michael.

197
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:35,843
- You all right?
- Yes. Put air bags in these things.

198
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:42,324
What do you call this place again?
The Surface of the Sun?

199
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:44,487
Mimi said that you talked
to him last night.

200
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:48,294
I told him that I was his father,
and he said something in Indian,

201
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,460
and then he gave
a girl a pot.

202
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,334
Giving a pot here is like
giving flowers. It's a love gift.

203
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:58,508
He's very popular
with the girls.

204
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:02,569
- Maybe he is mine after all.
- He is yours.

205
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:05,683
Why don't you try again? He's going
out on the river. Go with him.

206
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:07,684
Maybe I can teach him
about commodities.

207
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:10,721
Based on what I learned
in the bachelor hut last night,

208
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:12,983
he could make a killing
in gas futures.

209
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:16,027
- Go.
- Is it the local fruit?

210
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:36,205
- Baboon! Baboon!
- Huh?

211
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:40,209
No, no, no, no.
Monkey.

212
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:42,879
Monkey.

213
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:46,149
Toona. Toona.

214
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,589
Oh.

215
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:50,594
Parasite.

216
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:54,325
No, uh, Mimi, um-
Water? Wa-

217
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,166
Piranha.

218
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:03,269
Cut, infection, death!

219
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:07,502
Oh.

220
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,443
Hoko. Hoko.

221
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:16,010
Hoko- bird.

222
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,783
Bird who can't sing:
Hoko Ono.

223
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:21,951
No, no, no.
Hoko is toucan.

224
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,857
Bird is pomoko.

225
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:29,463
- You speak English?
- Paliku taught me.

226
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:32,469
So, you understood
everything I said last night.

227
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,940
Is it much further?

228
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:46,313
These shoes
cost me $500. Whoa!

229
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:54,488
Hey, hey, hey!

230
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:57,653
Good shot!

231
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:03,500
Buradu.

232
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:05,160
Okay.

233
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:10,503
- Scared of snake?
- No, scared of snake bite.

234
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,742
Ugh.

235
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:17,911
Eww.

236
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:23,554
- This buradu is dead, right?
- Sleeping. We kill it before we eat it.

237
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:26,522
No, no, no, no.
I do not eat snake.

238
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:35,528
- Lizard guts.
- Actually, the snake filled me right up.

239
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:39,263
- No. I make it for you. Tastes good.
- Oh.

240
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:46,702
Now you here, you stay
with me all the time?

241
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:49,212
I'd like to, Mimi Siku,
but I can't.

242
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:51,282
Why?

243
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:56,448
I have a whole
'nother life where I live.

244
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,453
Another son?

245
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,616
No. You're
the only son I have.

246
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,888
- I'll teach you to hunt.
- Tomorrow I've got to go to my village.

247
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:07,727
I'm a trader.
That's what I do, okay?

248
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:11,734
This in your village,
yes?

249
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:14,067
Woman who hold fire
up sky's butt?

250
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:20,234
I've never had her described
quite like that.

251
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:22,404
Yes, she's
in my village.

252
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:24,948
We call her
the Statue of Liberty.

253
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:28,575
When I'm a man, will you take me
to Statue of Liberty?

254
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:30,587
Sure.
Why not? Yeah.

255
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:32,884
When you're a man, I'll take you
to the Statue of Liberty.

256
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:36,051
- Wakatepe?
- Wakatepe.

257
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:47,767
Sleep time.

258
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,675
Ugh.

259
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:19,499
Mimi, don't move!

260
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,030
Don't move! There's
a giant spider on you!

261
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,303
Don't move!
What's it doing?

262
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:29,812
Oh, great!
It's now comin' after me!

263
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:32,884
Damn, it's chasin' me.
Stop, stop, stop!

264
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:36,317
I don't want
to hurt you, but I will.

265
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:39,151
I will crush you
like... a bug!

266
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:43,327
Mimi, don't. No, no.
I can handle this.

267
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:45,988
Go to the village.
Save yourself!

268
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:03,647
No, no, don't!
Back! Jesus!

269
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:22,564
If you scream,
Myteka attack.

270
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:26,000
If you're calm,
Myteka nice.

271
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:29,870
- But kukuve always mean.
- Who's kukuve?

272
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:32,034
Huh?

273
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:38,879
This place is a nightmare!

274
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:51,555
Baboon! Baboon!

275
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:57,734
Nice turtle.

276
00:23:57,836 --> 00:23:59,633
Baboon! Baboon!

277
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:02,740
The hair on your chest
reminds them of a monkey.

278
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:04,741
"Baboon" is
your Pinare name.

279
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:07,209
Baboon? That's the best
they could come up with?

280
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:11,305
At first they wanted to go with
"Man Who Must Be Smarter Than He Looks. "

281
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,078
If we get to pick our own names,
I'd like to pick this:

282
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:16,746
"Man Who's Extremely
Well-Endowed. "

283
00:24:16,855 --> 00:24:18,755
Sorry.
It's already taken.

284
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:32,103
- What's he sayin' to them?
- The chief is telling the forest that Mimi's no longer a child.

285
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:03,633
- Are they finished?
- Almost.

286
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:06,932
But to become
a tribal leader someday,

287
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:10,303
Mimi has to perform a special task
that the chief will give to him.

288
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:15,311
He says he's
very proud of Mimi Siku,

289
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:17,711
and, as his father,
you should be too.

290
00:25:19,417 --> 00:25:21,977
Well, I am very proud of him,
considering the fact...

291
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:24,385
that I just found out
a couple days ago I had a son,

292
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:27,390
and I'm standing
about four feet from a witch doctor.

293
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:43,503
Mimi has the task of bringing fire
back from the Statue of Liberty.

294
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:45,974
Guy doesn't
kid around, does he?

295
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:48,511
You promised to take me
to New York when I become a man, Baboon.

296
00:25:48,613 --> 00:25:52,515
- And when you're a man, I will.
- In this tribe, he is a man,

297
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:56,018
and he wants to go now?

298
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:59,989
No. Tomorrow we fly to Caracas,
we sign the divorce papers.

299
00:26:00,091 --> 00:26:02,924
Then I get in a big, steel bird
and fly back to New York City.

300
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:07,020
- Yakuza.
- Did you promise to take him or not?

301
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:11,193
Maybe. Mimi Siku, I have to be back
on the exchange floor.

302
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:13,601
I'm gettin' married.
I cannot take you tomorrow.

303
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:16,434
Here, if you make
a promise, you keep it.

304
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:20,341
"Tomorrow," "Can't," "Maybe. "
These words don't mean anything to Mimi.

305
00:26:20,445 --> 00:26:23,778
You brought him down here to live
with the Pirates of the Caribbean.

306
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:25,382
Maybe you should have
taught him better English.

307
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:28,452
This is the most important day
in your son's life,

308
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:30,680
and he wanted you here
to share it with him,

309
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:33,553
and now you're going to humiliate him
in front of the whole tribe...

310
00:26:33,658 --> 00:26:36,286
by not keeping the first promise
you ever made to him?

311
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:40,455
Baboon, I-
I want to go.

312
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:45,400
Mimi Siku, I am-
I'm very sorry.

313
00:26:45,503 --> 00:26:48,131
You made
wakatepe with me.

314
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:21,767
Excuse me, Mr. Cromwell,

315
00:27:21,873 --> 00:27:26,105
but the young man you're with
is urinating on the exit door.

316
00:27:26,211 --> 00:27:28,611
Thank you.

317
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:38,913
Me happy to be
with you, Baboon.

318
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:45,428
Michael!
Michael!

319
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:48,328
All right, we gotta
get movin' here pretty-

320
00:27:48,466 --> 00:27:52,368
Get on. It's just a moving sidewalk.

321
00:27:54,205 --> 00:27:56,196
Michael!
Hey, Mike!

322
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,935
- Michael, how ya doin'?
- Richard, what are you doing here?

323
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:01,478
I told Langston you had a reason.
You do have a reason, right?

324
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:03,672
- For what?
- For holding on to the beans.

325
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:06,875
- What beans?
- The coffee beans.

326
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:09,043
- You didn't sell them?
- No.

327
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:12,179
I told you to sell them
at 97 and a half.

328
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:15,986
Oh, God,
I'm dead!

329
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:19,655
I'm gonna lose my house!
Where will my children live?

330
00:28:19,764 --> 00:28:22,289
Richard- Excuse me. Richard.

331
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,369
Why didn't ya sell?

332
00:28:25,503 --> 00:28:28,995
- 'Cause you didn't confirm, that's why!
- What?

333
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:31,803
- You did not confirm.
- What's coffee doin' now?

334
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:35,004
It's under 90 cents
and gone limit down.

335
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:40,349
I asked you- I told you
to sell it at 97 and a half,

336
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:42,420
and you can't do it 'cause
I didn't say "confirm"?

337
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,920
- You're an idiot!
- Look, for 15 years, Michael,

338
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:46,990
you say "sell,"
I say "confirm. "

339
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:49,026
Sell, confirm.
Sell, confirm.

340
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:52,756
You confirm, and I sell.
You didn't confirm, so I didn't sell.

341
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:55,024
Look, kid, I've given
to the rain forest, okay?

342
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:57,033
His name is Mimi Siku.

343
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:02,339
- He's my son.
- What do you mean, "son"?

344
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,102
You didn't have one
when you left here three days ago.

345
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:08,371
Well, apparently I did.

346
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,710
He's Patricia's son.

347
00:29:12,817 --> 00:29:16,014
He's Patricia
and my son.

348
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:23,860
- This your village, Baboon?
- Yep. This is my village.

349
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:26,863
It's big.

350
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:56,391
Where are all the animals?

351
00:29:56,494 --> 00:29:59,827
Up in their offices, where they work.

352
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:02,762
Cromwell!

353
00:30:02,867 --> 00:30:04,892
Okay.
Take a look at that.

354
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:08,063
Baboon must go
fight the chief.

355
00:30:08,173 --> 00:30:11,734
Look at this!
Cromwell, look at this.

356
00:30:11,843 --> 00:30:16,246
Coffee is at 88,
and it's dropping like a brick!

357
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:19,783
By tomorrow morning,
it could be 85 or lower.

358
00:30:19,884 --> 00:30:22,409
Just wait it out.
Something will happen.

359
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,250
- The market will turn around.
- But what if it doesn't?

360
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:26,983
You remember
what happened in '91?

361
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:29,355
You can't always depend
on a natural disaster.

362
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:32,520
It doesn't have to be a disaster.
We can hope for an assassination.

363
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,529
Would you
take it seriously for one minute?

364
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,327
- I'm trying to lighten this guy up.
- Stop it. Stop it!

365
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:38,458
Now, come on.
Behave yourselves here!

366
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:43,769
Something better happen fast, or I'm
gonna throw your butts out the window!

367
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:47,276
What do you hotshots
think about when you make these deals?

368
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:50,446
You seem to have forgotten,
Cromwell, that you...

369
00:30:50,548 --> 00:30:53,449
were investing
the company's money.

370
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:57,612
When you invest the company's money
and win, the company's behind you.

371
00:30:57,722 --> 00:31:03,285
But when you screw up like this, you're
both on the hook for any loss we take.

372
00:31:03,394 --> 00:31:06,522
- That would be over a million dollars.
- That's not my problem.

373
00:31:06,664 --> 00:31:08,928
And by the way, Cromwell,

374
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:13,970
when somebody is playing
with millions of dollars of my money,

375
00:31:14,072 --> 00:31:16,472
I generally like them
in the country.

376
00:31:16,574 --> 00:31:19,099
- This country!
- Stop yelling, please.

377
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,269
This is still my office.

378
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:24,815
I'll shout, I'll yell,
I'll scream as much as I want.

379
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:26,941
When I made you shareholders
in this company,

380
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:29,815
it was to share profits,
not losses!

381
00:31:29,921 --> 00:31:32,947
Not losses is right!
We're not here to share losses!

382
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:36,823
We're here
to share profits. Profits!

383
00:31:36,928 --> 00:31:40,557
Profits! Huh?

384
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:45,499
Look up! It's an alien circle
with Mickey Rourke's picture in it.

385
00:31:45,603 --> 00:31:47,901
Look, look,
look, look, look!

386
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:50,633
Up, up! Look!
Look up! Look up!

387
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:53,006
He just found out
that he has a son.

388
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:56,012
Look, look, look, look, look!

389
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:59,174
Stop shouting, Baboon.
Myteka kill chief.

390
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:02,014
Catch the damn spider,
will you, please?

391
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:06,853
Mm. I-I-I said I was gonna go fight
the chief, not kill the chief.

392
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:11,588
Around here, only... postal employees
kill chief. Do you understand?

393
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:21,371
Boy, whatever you do in Venezuela,
do not try the chili del fuego.

394
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:32,716
And I say we should just wait it out.

395
00:32:32,817 --> 00:32:35,217
You're insane. Langston is right.

396
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:38,721
We have to find a buyer for the coffee,
cut our losses and get out now.

397
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:44,053
Wow! Nice shot!

398
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:50,392
Put this away.

399
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:52,901
Would you give me a few moments with
Charlotte before you bring Mimi up?

400
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:54,972
All right.

401
00:33:00,044 --> 00:33:03,445
- Michael, you're back!
- Where's Brian? Brian, let's go.

402
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:06,517
Come on.
Come, come, come.

403
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:10,314
- Mmm.
- I missed you. You never called me.

404
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:14,624
We're here, but we're
not "here," okay?

405
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:17,923
Try to think of us as,
uh, furniture.

406
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:20,793
- Just act natural.
- So, did you miss me, darling?

407
00:33:22,066 --> 00:33:24,626
I missed you very much.

408
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:27,762
My pieces in the show were
such a hit that Ian-

409
00:33:27,872 --> 00:33:30,136
Michael Cromwell,
this is Ian Finch-Chumley.

410
00:33:30,241 --> 00:33:32,141
- Good to meet you, Ian.
- Hi, Michael.

411
00:33:32,243 --> 00:33:34,803
He's doing a profile on me
for the Fashion Channel.

412
00:33:34,912 --> 00:33:37,039
He'll be following me from now
through the spring collection,

413
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:39,172
and he'll be covering
the wedding as well.

414
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:41,478
Isn't that fabulous?

415
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:43,645
There's a Fashion Channel?

416
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:46,519
- Yeah.
- Forget the camera.

417
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:48,648
Just talk to me.
They're furniture.

418
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,285
Now, honey, did you
get everything settled?

419
00:33:53,498 --> 00:33:56,661
- Yeah.
- Yes! Oh!

420
00:33:56,768 --> 00:34:01,330
Actually, um- Actually, Patricia
was very reasonable.

421
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:06,502
So... what did
you bring me?

422
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:08,169
Ow!

423
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:10,975
So, Mimi,
how old are you?

424
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:14,848
The roots
of the Yomano tree...

425
00:34:14,952 --> 00:34:17,887
have broken ground
three times in my life.

426
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:21,355
So, I guess that
would make you around-

427
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:24,993
- Thirteen.
- Thirteen. Thirteen.

428
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:29,395
You know, I have a daughter
around that age. Karen.

429
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:31,866
Will I meet daughter?

430
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:34,403
Yeah, yeah. She's just up
at Charlotte's now.

431
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:36,336
She's trying on her dress
for the wedding.

432
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:40,541
- What are you doing?
- Feed Myteka.

433
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:42,545
What's Myteka?

434
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:52,888
- Are you upset?
- You brought back a child.

435
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:56,391
Everyone else I know comes back
from South America with a bag of coffee.

436
00:34:56,494 --> 00:34:58,394
Well, I have ten million
bags of coffee.

437
00:34:58,496 --> 00:35:00,760
I thought I'd bring back something
with a little less caffeine.

438
00:35:00,898 --> 00:35:03,765
I have a show to prepare
and a wedding to plan.

439
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:09,096
That's months away. Honey?

440
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:13,442
He's only gonna be here
for a short while.

441
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:22,218
- Mimi.
- Baboon.

442
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,618
- What have you done with Mr. Kempster?
- Excuse me. Michael.

443
00:35:24,755 --> 00:35:27,246
- Do you know who Myteka is?
- Daddy!

444
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:35,924
Karen. Look at you.
You look... beautiful.

445
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:38,934
Angel on table.

446
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:47,277
- Look at me. I'm smoking.
- The rain forest is a very hot issue.

447
00:35:47,378 --> 00:35:50,575
Being associated
with this, uh, jungle bloke,

448
00:35:50,681 --> 00:35:52,444
it can only help you.

449
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:55,417
Where's the rain forest?

450
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,819
Brian, find out
where the rain forest is.

451
00:35:58,956 --> 00:36:00,981
Right.

452
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,788
Oh!

453
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:07,763
Mimi Siku,
this is Charlotte,

454
00:36:07,865 --> 00:36:11,096
and, uh, Charlotte,
this is Mimi Siku.

455
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:13,295
It's a pleasure
to meet you, Mimi Siki.

456
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:15,338
- Mimi Siku.
- Mimi Siku.

457
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:18,499
- This your female, Baboon?
- This is my female.

458
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:21,806
And as his female,
I'd like to invite you...

459
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:24,381
to dinner tonight
with Fiona Gluckman.

460
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:28,645
She's the fashion editor
of Elle magazine.

461
00:36:28,753 --> 00:36:33,122
Very major. She wants to see
the sketches for my wedding trousseau.

462
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:37,217
And if you're available,
I'd love for you to join us.

463
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:40,159
Is there anything special
you like to eat?

464
00:36:40,264 --> 00:36:42,164
Lizard guts.

465
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:44,564
- Lizard guts?
- Yes, but very lean.

466
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:48,562
- Great earrings. Honey!
- Oh!

467
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:50,640
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Mimi, Mimi, Mimi.

468
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:52,709
Do you remember what we talked about,
using the toilet on the airplane?

469
00:36:52,843 --> 00:36:54,811
Let's continue to do that.

470
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:57,904
I will find the men's room for him,
and we will see you tonight.

471
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,245
Come on, Mimi.

472
00:37:02,753 --> 00:37:04,744
Will he be wearing
the loincloth to dinner?

473
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,823
I'll get him some clothes.

474
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:10,184
No, no, no, no.
Don't, don't, don't.

475
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:13,889
Before you pee, you lift the seat. After
you pee, you put the seat back down.

476
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:17,194
Females in tribe start war over this.
Many deaths.

477
00:37:20,871 --> 00:37:23,396
Oh, that's very good.
Very-

478
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:26,237
Bob Montgomery.
That's wonderful.

479
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:29,505
Listen. So, Bob, I'm standing
with Michael Cromwell,

480
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:32,208
and, you know, considering
our long history together,

481
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:34,841
you're the first person
we wanna make this offer to.

482
00:37:34,952 --> 00:37:39,286
Are you ready?
Fifty-one hundred tons of coffee beans.

483
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:45,691
- We're dead. Okay?
- Baboon!

484
00:37:45,796 --> 00:37:48,230
- Ah! He's doing a Fay Wray!
- Baboon!

485
00:37:48,332 --> 00:37:51,028
- Michael! Mumu!
- Mimi!

486
00:37:51,135 --> 00:37:53,262
- Come back inside!
- Statue of Liberty, Baboon.

487
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:55,895
- You do as I tell you.
- Get this!

488
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:58,407
- Come look!
- No, no, no! Come back here!

489
00:37:58,509 --> 00:38:01,740
- Mimi, Get back in here.
- Cool.

490
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:03,780
- Life happens around you!
- Move. Get outta my way.

491
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:06,405
Come on. Mimi!
Watch out, watch out, watch out.

492
00:38:06,517 --> 00:38:08,417
- Mimi! Mimi!
- Get the wide-angle lens!

493
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:10,453
Get out of the way, please!

494
00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:16,752
Mimi!
Wait, wait, wait!

495
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:32,275
Statue of Liberty, Baboon.
Statue not far, Baboon.

496
00:38:32,376 --> 00:38:34,901
Mimi, you stand right there.

497
00:38:35,012 --> 00:38:38,072
- We go now?
- We'll go tomorrow, okay?

498
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:43,943
Whoa. Ahhh.

499
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:46,148
People down there
so far from us.

500
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:49,123
I'd like to keep 'em
that way, okay?

501
00:38:49,226 --> 00:38:51,319
I'm gonna die up here.

502
00:38:51,462 --> 00:38:53,987
Nothing bad happened,
Baboon.

503
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:56,929
I just hate heights.

504
00:38:57,034 --> 00:38:58,763
Whoa.

505
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:00,928
Oh.

506
00:39:01,038 --> 00:39:03,302
Pinare secret:
Don't look down.

507
00:39:03,407 --> 00:39:06,604
Just for the record,
it's not that big a secret.

508
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:12,608
Yeah!

509
00:39:12,717 --> 00:39:15,811
Don't you ever, ever,
ever do that to me again!

510
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,356
When I tell you to do something,
I mean it. Do you understand me?

511
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:21,117
Mimi Siku sorry.

512
00:39:22,493 --> 00:39:24,393
Come on. Come on. Come on.

513
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:28,523
Mm, sorry.

514
00:39:30,568 --> 00:39:33,162
I was just worried about you out there.
I really was. All right?

515
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:35,295
Well, um,
we should go.

516
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:44,147
- Baboon scared?
- Yes, Baboon scared.

517
00:39:44,248 --> 00:39:46,409
Baboon not know
he could be so scared.

518
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,415
Baboon's pants
a little damp.

519
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:58,025
- Charlie, this is fabulous!
- Mimi, get down.

520
00:39:58,129 --> 00:40:02,031
When I saw the shoulders
on this gown, I plotzed.

521
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:05,102
I said to myself, "Fiona,

522
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,534
this- this is
the future of fashion. "

523
00:40:07,638 --> 00:40:10,072
Oh, no. Remember
what I told ya?

524
00:40:10,207 --> 00:40:12,175
Forks go on the left side.
This side.

525
00:40:12,276 --> 00:40:15,439
Small fork on the outside. Take your
knife, put it over next to the spoon.

526
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:18,070
The blade- The blade in.
Perfect.

527
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:20,683
Yeah. Might wanna work
on that one too.

528
00:40:20,785 --> 00:40:22,685
In Lipo Lipo,
we eat with hands.

529
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:25,221
In New York, New York,
we eat with forks.

530
00:40:25,322 --> 00:40:27,847
When are we gonna eat?
I'm famished!

531
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:30,426
A little champagne?

532
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:32,722
Gino, why don't you show her
the bridesmaids sketches?

533
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:34,855
Show me, show me,
show me, show me.

534
00:40:37,835 --> 00:40:40,565
Oh, I'm loving this!

535
00:40:41,672 --> 00:40:43,071
Ah!

536
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:45,904
What is taking so long
with the food?

537
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:47,910
I'll give them a call.

538
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:55,581
I don't eat meat, I don't eat dairy
or nightshade vegetables,

539
00:40:55,686 --> 00:40:58,416
and, of course,
I don't touch preservatives.

540
00:40:58,522 --> 00:41:01,286
Obviously.

541
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:03,985
- Cat fat.
- Mm-hmm.

542
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:07,928
- We eat cat.
- Excuse me?

543
00:41:08,032 --> 00:41:10,296
That must be the food.

544
00:41:10,434 --> 00:41:12,925
- Oh! Finally.
- Gino, Louis.

545
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:14,937
Coming.

546
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:17,098
We are not going
to eat the cat.

547
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:26,274
- Cat's job, feed people.
- No, not here.

548
00:41:26,383 --> 00:41:30,342
Here, cat's job is to sleep
and lick crotch.

549
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:35,187
Oh, Charlie,
it smells so good! I can't stand it!

550
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:37,521
Of course, this is much
too much for me.

551
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:39,652
Did they forget
my tiramisu?

552
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:46,127
- Oh, God!
- This much tasty.

553
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:48,671
Your female makes
good food, Baboon.

554
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:50,797
Oh!

555
00:41:50,908 --> 00:41:53,001
Oh, Louis,
you are such a cliche.

556
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:09,186
- You had no right to change the rules.
- What rules?

557
00:42:09,326 --> 00:42:11,294
When we talked about
having children,

558
00:42:11,395 --> 00:42:14,330
we agreed that you would be my child
and that I would be your child,

559
00:42:14,431 --> 00:42:17,457
and now I find out
that you've had a child all along.

560
00:42:17,568 --> 00:42:20,469
Wait a second. Are you saying
that I knew that I had a child?

561
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:23,472
Well, if I had a child,
I certainly would have known.

562
00:42:23,574 --> 00:42:27,010
Hello! You're a woman. Of course you'd
know. You're there when you have it!

563
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:32,014
There's no magical bond between a father
and son that spans the continents.

564
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:35,347
The only reason I know I have a child
is because you insisted-

565
00:42:35,452 --> 00:42:38,649
So now you're saying that you
having a child is my fault?

566
00:42:38,756 --> 00:42:40,815
- I don't think so, Michael.
- Mimi's just visiting.

567
00:42:40,925 --> 00:42:43,155
I wanna show him
a good time.

568
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:47,754
After that, he goes back home, and we
can go back to being the way we were-

569
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:51,026
entirely wrapped up
in ourselves.

570
00:42:51,135 --> 00:42:53,228
Promise?

571
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:48,421
Ow!

572
00:44:39,877 --> 00:44:43,005
My little darlings.

573
00:44:45,649 --> 00:44:50,848
Ah. Ooh. Are your
little bellies empty?

574
00:44:50,988 --> 00:44:52,979
Oh.

575
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:54,648
Bonjour.

576
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:58,858
Ah. Bonjour.

577
00:44:58,996 --> 00:45:02,625
We are all
so happy today, n'est-ce pas?

578
00:45:05,102 --> 00:45:07,127
What's goin' on up here?

579
00:45:07,237 --> 00:45:10,536
Did you- Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

580
00:45:10,674 --> 00:45:13,370
Go! Go!

581
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:16,638
Mimi, you can't do this. You do not
kill birds around here for breakfast.

582
00:45:16,747 --> 00:45:20,183
If you're hungry, ask me.
I bought some stuff for ya.

583
00:45:20,284 --> 00:45:22,844
This is what kids love.
Cap'n Crunch.

584
00:45:22,953 --> 00:45:25,148
What is?

585
00:45:25,255 --> 00:45:30,693
This is cereal. It's just corn,
brown sugar, yellow #5 and zinc oxide?

586
00:45:30,794 --> 00:45:33,763
They've added
a sunblock to it.

587
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:38,061
You pour this on this, and that's
your breakfast. Enjoy yourself.

588
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:44,840
Charlie. Come on.
Wake up, sweetheart.

589
00:45:44,942 --> 00:45:49,003
Wake up. Charlie.
Bloomingdale's burned down.

590
00:45:49,113 --> 00:45:51,377
What?

591
00:45:51,482 --> 00:45:53,541
Mimi's having breakfast
out in the kitchen.

592
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:55,880
I will be home
before lunch.

593
00:45:55,986 --> 00:45:58,386
- Bye.
- Wait.

594
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:02,755
I can't watch him.
Women's Wear is coming to the loft.

595
00:46:02,893 --> 00:46:05,521
You don't need to baby-sit him.
He'll be fine.

596
00:46:05,629 --> 00:46:07,529
Now go back to sleep.

597
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:14,866
Mmm.

598
00:46:14,972 --> 00:46:18,464
Mimi, I gotta get goin' here.
No. No!

599
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:20,577
This isn't- No.
No, it's not your fault.

600
00:46:20,677 --> 00:46:24,272
I didn't mention that you
usually put this in a bowl.

601
00:46:24,414 --> 00:46:26,279
When we go
to Statue of Liberty?

602
00:46:26,416 --> 00:46:28,748
- Uh, tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

603
00:46:28,852 --> 00:46:31,946
I know I told you
we were going today, but I can't today.

604
00:46:32,089 --> 00:46:34,956
I- I- The Baboon's makin'
some very big trades today.

605
00:46:35,092 --> 00:46:37,424
- Me go trade with Baboon.
- Baboon go alone.

606
00:46:37,528 --> 00:46:41,726
I'd like to be around you,
but, but I'm obligated to go.

607
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:44,567
What means "obligated"?

608
00:46:44,668 --> 00:46:46,932
Obligated.
It means...

609
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:51,767
when you do something that
you don't really wanna do.

610
00:46:51,875 --> 00:46:53,775
Okay.

611
00:46:56,046 --> 00:46:59,573
- Baboon obligated.
- And will you promise Baboon one thing?

612
00:46:59,683 --> 00:47:02,243
You won't shoot
any more animals?

613
00:47:05,022 --> 00:47:06,990
And don't eat the cat.

614
00:47:07,124 --> 00:47:09,752
I'll bring
food home.

615
00:47:39,056 --> 00:47:41,957
Myteka?
Myteka?

616
00:47:43,093 --> 00:47:44,993
Myteka?

617
00:47:46,096 --> 00:47:48,155
Myteka?

618
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,634
Myteka?

619
00:47:53,403 --> 00:47:55,496
Myteka?

620
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:58,640
Myteka.

621
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:02,310
Myteka.

622
00:48:07,584 --> 00:48:09,484
Myteka?

623
00:48:17,928 --> 00:48:20,522
Nice pushibushi.

624
00:48:20,631 --> 00:48:24,692
That is the last pushibushi you're gonna
see around here, you little savage!

625
00:48:34,478 --> 00:48:36,537
Hi, we're not here
right now. Leave a message.

626
00:48:36,647 --> 00:48:39,081
We'll call you right back.

627
00:48:39,216 --> 00:48:41,241
Charlie. Pick up. It's me.

628
00:48:43,153 --> 00:48:45,713
You're probably in the bathroom,
making yourself look beautiful.

629
00:48:45,822 --> 00:48:48,552
Um, I don't want you
feelin' trapped by Mimi.

630
00:48:48,659 --> 00:48:53,255
Try to open up to him.
Just don't leave him alone with the cat.

631
00:48:53,397 --> 00:48:55,297
I'll see you soon.
I love you. Bye.

632
00:48:59,803 --> 00:49:02,567
Michael, don't hang up!
Don't hang up! There's a spider!

633
00:49:04,741 --> 00:49:07,904
This can't be happening!
This is a penthouse apartment!

634
00:49:08,011 --> 00:49:12,573
# There's nothing to gain when
there's nothing to be lost #

635
00:49:15,185 --> 00:49:18,814
# There's nothing to gain if you
stay behind and count the cost #

636
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:26,562
# Make a decision you can be
who you can be you can be #

637
00:49:26,663 --> 00:49:31,225
# Tasting the fruit
Come to the liberty tree #

638
00:49:31,335 --> 00:49:33,269
# Someday #

639
00:49:36,873 --> 00:49:40,331
Help a guy out.
Spare change for food?

640
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:43,469
Help a guy out.
Spare change for food? Uh.

641
00:49:43,613 --> 00:49:45,911
- Eat.
- # Changin' your ways #

642
00:49:46,016 --> 00:49:48,780
- # Making those surrounding you #
- Hmm.

643
00:49:50,721 --> 00:49:53,815
# Changin' your ways
More than any man can do #

644
00:49:53,957 --> 00:49:55,925
Right!

645
00:49:56,026 --> 00:50:01,623
# Find your brothers and sisters who can
hear all the truth in what you say #

646
00:50:01,732 --> 00:50:04,166
- Much night fun.
- Honey, come on.

647
00:50:04,301 --> 00:50:09,295
- Mom!
- # They can support you when you're on your way today #

648
00:50:09,406 --> 00:50:13,638
# Your day
It's your day #

649
00:50:13,744 --> 00:50:15,939
- Right there.
- That way?

650
00:50:16,046 --> 00:50:17,673
- Right there.
- Thank you.
