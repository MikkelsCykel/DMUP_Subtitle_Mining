1
00:00:09,682 --> 00:00:11,217
My first...

2
00:00:11,317 --> 00:00:13,052
my last...

3
00:00:13,152 --> 00:00:15,586
my everything.

4
00:00:17,056 --> 00:00:19,392
And the answer to...

5
00:00:19,492 --> 00:00:22,188
all my dreams.

6
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:26,266
You're my sun...

7
00:00:26,366 --> 00:00:28,301
my moon...

8
00:00:28,401 --> 00:00:31,271
my guiding star.

9
00:00:31,371 --> 00:00:32,360
Sing!

10
00:00:36,409 --> 00:00:38,811
That's what you are.

11
00:00:38,911 --> 00:00:40,780
I know...

12
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,116
there's only...

13
00:00:43,216 --> 00:00:45,411
only one like you.

14
00:00:46,652 --> 00:00:48,721
There's no way...

15
00:00:48,821 --> 00:00:50,423
they could have made two.

16
00:00:50,523 --> 00:00:51,791
They couldn't have made two!

17
00:00:51,891 --> 00:00:53,559
You the only one!

18
00:00:53,659 --> 00:00:57,397
You're all I'm living for.

19
00:00:57,497 --> 00:01:00,833
Your love I'll keep forevermore.

20
00:01:00,933 --> 00:01:02,669
You're the first.

21
00:01:02,769 --> 00:01:04,437
You're the last.

22
00:01:04,537 --> 00:01:06,596
My everything.

23
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,334
Oh, shit!

24
00:01:26,058 --> 00:01:27,525
Go, man, go!

25
00:01:37,837 --> 00:01:39,305
What you got?

26
00:01:39,405 --> 00:01:40,807
Dodgers tickets,
Lakers tickets...

27
00:01:40,907 --> 00:01:44,043
and Phantom of the Opera
tickets.

28
00:01:44,143 --> 00:01:46,646
It's theater.
You ever been to the theater?

29
00:01:46,746 --> 00:01:47,914
What the hell wrong with you?

30
00:01:48,014 --> 00:01:50,450
Nobody give a damn
about Phantom of the Opera.

31
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:51,818
Franklin,
there's money in culture.

32
00:01:51,918 --> 00:01:53,252
Let me tell you something,
Roland.

33
00:01:53,352 --> 00:01:55,154
Black people
don't want to see that.

34
00:01:55,254 --> 00:01:57,790
Get me some good shit,
like Luther Vandross tickets.

35
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:59,892
Luther Vandross is not culture.

36
00:01:59,992 --> 00:02:01,794
Fuck culture!

37
00:02:01,894 --> 00:02:04,330
People complain about
these fucked up tickets.

38
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,698
You're making me look bad.

39
00:02:05,798 --> 00:02:08,935
Next time,
come up with some better stuff.

40
00:02:09,035 --> 00:02:10,303
OK.

41
00:02:10,403 --> 00:02:12,672
I'm not fuckin' with you.
I'm for real!

42
00:02:12,772 --> 00:02:13,673
You owe me.

43
00:02:13,773 --> 00:02:16,264
I don't owe you shit.

44
00:02:47,807 --> 00:02:48,941
Where have you been?

45
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:51,010
You're supposed to wash it,
not take it for a joyride.

46
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:53,279
Where you been?
I been looking for you.

47
00:02:53,379 --> 00:02:54,447
What?

48
00:02:54,547 --> 00:02:55,681
I've been looking for you.

49
00:02:55,781 --> 00:02:57,350
I'm glad I found you.

50
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:58,718
Get the hell on.

51
00:02:58,818 --> 00:03:00,683
That's him. Let's do this.

52
00:03:10,897 --> 00:03:12,298
I need two on the floor.

53
00:03:12,398 --> 00:03:14,734
I need $200.

54
00:03:14,834 --> 00:03:18,638
Same time. I don't know you.

55
00:03:18,738 --> 00:03:19,705
Willie.

56
00:03:19,805 --> 00:03:21,568
All righty.

57
00:03:26,612 --> 00:03:27,680
Get out of here.

58
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,482
Try to hide some of this.

59
00:03:29,582 --> 00:03:31,573
Keep it on the down-low.
You'll get a nigger busted.

60
00:03:34,487 --> 00:03:36,956
Get me locked up.

61
00:03:37,056 --> 00:03:38,990
Hurry up.

62
00:03:42,695 --> 00:03:45,698
-How we doing?
-What you need?

63
00:03:45,798 --> 00:03:48,734
Let me guess.
Two to the Phantom of the Opera?

64
00:03:48,834 --> 00:03:50,002
I've already seen it.

65
00:03:50,102 --> 00:03:51,704
Wait a minute.

66
00:03:51,804 --> 00:03:55,708
You that silly ass reporter
from the Channel Five News.

67
00:03:55,808 --> 00:03:57,009
Channel 12, actually.

68
00:03:57,109 --> 00:03:58,177
What's up?

69
00:03:58,277 --> 00:04:00,079
James Russell. How you doing?

70
00:04:00,179 --> 00:04:02,348
Wonder if we can talk to you
on camera.

71
00:04:02,448 --> 00:04:04,250
Julio, is that all right?

72
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:05,751
Whatever you want to do.

73
00:04:05,851 --> 00:04:06,919
Let's roll it.

74
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:08,187
Speed.

75
00:04:08,287 --> 00:04:10,687
-Wait a minute.
-Cut.

76
00:04:11,724 --> 00:04:14,284
Let me straighten out my shit.

77
00:04:16,896 --> 00:04:18,097
I'm ready. Let's go.

78
00:04:18,197 --> 00:04:20,099
You're ready? You sure?

79
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:21,689
I'm sure.

80
00:04:23,235 --> 00:04:25,438
This is James Russell...

81
00:04:25,538 --> 00:04:28,307
reporting on our city
and her crimes.

82
00:04:28,407 --> 00:04:32,778
I'm here talking
to the car wash hustler.

83
00:04:32,878 --> 00:04:35,248
You've got
quite an operation here.

84
00:04:35,348 --> 00:04:36,849
What is going on down here?

85
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:37,984
I'm a businessman.

86
00:04:38,084 --> 00:04:40,018
What the fuck you think
goin' on?

87
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,722
What?

88
00:04:42,822 --> 00:04:44,557
You can't use
that kind of language on TV.

89
00:04:44,657 --> 00:04:45,958
What language?

90
00:04:46,058 --> 00:04:47,226
Fuck.

91
00:04:47,326 --> 00:04:48,561
Fuck what?

92
00:04:48,661 --> 00:04:49,996
You cannot say "fuck"
on television.

93
00:04:50,096 --> 00:04:53,332
Fuck that.
You the one wanted an interview.

94
00:04:53,432 --> 00:04:55,368
Hurry up. I got shit to do.

95
00:04:55,468 --> 00:04:58,538
I got shit to do, also.

96
00:04:58,638 --> 00:04:59,539
Get on with it.

97
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:00,640
Speed.

98
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:04,443
This is James Russell reporting
on our city--

99
00:05:04,543 --> 00:05:05,811
Hey, Franklin!

100
00:05:05,911 --> 00:05:07,179
What's up?

101
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:08,481
I gotta go.

102
00:05:08,581 --> 00:05:10,816
Y'all do a commercial
or find somebody else.

103
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:12,440
What up, Carmine?

104
00:05:16,722 --> 00:05:19,058
I ain't seen you in a long time.

105
00:05:19,158 --> 00:05:20,682
Fucking cut!

106
00:05:23,462 --> 00:05:26,265
When am I gonna get my money?

107
00:05:26,365 --> 00:05:28,134
What money?

108
00:05:28,234 --> 00:05:29,468
Wait a minute.

109
00:05:29,568 --> 00:05:32,538
You're talking about
the money I owe you.

110
00:05:32,638 --> 00:05:34,040
I'm gonna pay you.

111
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,608
You know I'll pay you.

112
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:36,676
And I got your phone calls.

113
00:05:36,776 --> 00:05:41,380
When you call--
Somebody stole my phone.

114
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,469
Can you believe that shit?

115
00:05:53,693 --> 00:05:57,330
I don't like brothers,
and I don't like welchers.

116
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:00,166
Killing you would be double fun.

117
00:06:00,266 --> 00:06:01,901
Stop playing.

118
00:06:02,001 --> 00:06:04,570
What are you talking
about killing for?

119
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:07,073
If you kill me,
how am I gonna pay you?

120
00:06:07,173 --> 00:06:08,941
Open the door,
get out of my car...

121
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:10,776
get on the street,
and get my money.

122
00:06:10,876 --> 00:06:12,778
I'm gonna get it,
but don't leave mad.

123
00:06:12,878 --> 00:06:14,080
Give me a hug or something.

124
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,647
-Get out.
-A kiss?

125
00:06:23,022 --> 00:06:24,090
Franklin Hatchett?

126
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:26,626
He dead. They buried him
at the Compton cemetery.

127
00:06:26,726 --> 00:06:28,694
You're under arrest.

128
00:06:28,794 --> 00:06:30,896
What the fuck y'all doing?

129
00:06:30,996 --> 00:06:32,465
I didn't do shit!

130
00:06:32,565 --> 00:06:33,466
Nobody ever does.

131
00:06:33,566 --> 00:06:35,668
You have the right
to remain silent.

132
00:06:35,768 --> 00:06:37,136
Wait a minute.

133
00:06:37,236 --> 00:06:39,038
I'll give you $5.00
to let me out.

134
00:06:39,138 --> 00:06:41,374
Bribery, too?

135
00:06:41,474 --> 00:06:42,875
In the car.

136
00:06:42,975 --> 00:06:45,978
Watch my head.

137
00:06:46,078 --> 00:06:48,774
He offered me $5.00.

138
00:06:50,616 --> 00:06:53,819
Channel 5, help a brother out?

139
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,655
Geraldo!

140
00:06:55,755 --> 00:06:57,156
You ain't gonna do nothing?

141
00:06:57,256 --> 00:06:58,691
I'm gonna get your ass!

142
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:00,993
A serious crime.

143
00:07:01,093 --> 00:07:02,328
Justified punishment.

144
00:07:02,428 --> 00:07:04,597
This is James Russell reporting.

145
00:07:04,697 --> 00:07:06,187
Channel 12 News.

146
00:07:09,401 --> 00:07:10,561
We got him.

147
00:07:11,771 --> 00:07:13,539
We didn't get shit.

148
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:15,266
Let's get out of here.

149
00:07:17,042 --> 00:07:19,545
I am dead serious.
The po-po trippin'.

150
00:07:19,645 --> 00:07:20,846
Ever since that O.J. shit.

151
00:07:20,946 --> 00:07:22,281
I was rolling down the street,
wasn't doing nothing.

152
00:07:22,381 --> 00:07:23,883
They gonna pull me over.

153
00:07:23,983 --> 00:07:25,618
I was just living
ghetto fabulous.

154
00:07:25,718 --> 00:07:27,620
I had five of my finest hos--

155
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,821
Are you hot?

156
00:07:28,921 --> 00:07:30,923
A little,
but I was just chillin'.

157
00:07:31,023 --> 00:07:33,726
The cop pull behind me,
lights and everything--

158
00:07:33,826 --> 00:07:35,161
"Get out of the car."

159
00:07:35,261 --> 00:07:36,785
I said,
"I ain't gettin' out the car."

160
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:40,866
Then all my hos was scared.

161
00:07:40,966 --> 00:07:42,201
They was like, "We scared."

162
00:07:42,301 --> 00:07:43,402
They be saying stuff
like that.

163
00:07:43,502 --> 00:07:47,440
I was like, "I ain't stopping.
I ain't do nothing."

164
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,908
And he said, "Get out the car."

165
00:07:49,008 --> 00:07:51,477
I got out and said,
"What you calling backup for?

166
00:07:51,577 --> 00:07:53,379
"This is between me and you."

167
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:55,581
They got my license,
my registration, everything.

168
00:07:55,681 --> 00:07:57,450
You gotta talk to 'em.

169
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:58,651
Stop playing.

170
00:07:58,751 --> 00:08:01,287
He started trippin'.
That's when I slapped him.

171
00:08:01,387 --> 00:08:03,989
I put his handcuffs on him...

172
00:08:04,089 --> 00:08:05,324
put him in the back seat,
and said...

173
00:08:05,424 --> 00:08:06,659
"I'm gonna take your ass
to jail...

174
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:08,694
"'cause you're
the one trippin'."

175
00:08:08,794 --> 00:08:10,429
They put their hands on you?

176
00:08:10,529 --> 00:08:12,765
One dude tried to grab me
from the back.

177
00:08:12,865 --> 00:08:14,266
That's how they caught me.

178
00:08:14,366 --> 00:08:16,035
From the back? How they do it?

179
00:08:16,135 --> 00:08:19,271
They tried to grab me
like this, jack me up.

180
00:08:19,371 --> 00:08:20,306
Like that?

181
00:08:20,406 --> 00:08:23,375
They was grabbing.
They was trippin'.

182
00:08:23,475 --> 00:08:24,635
Like that.

183
00:08:27,046 --> 00:08:28,748
Get the hell off me!

184
00:08:28,848 --> 00:08:30,873
Where's your shirt at?

185
00:08:37,957 --> 00:08:38,946
Good-bye, sweetness.

186
00:08:42,228 --> 00:08:43,996
Where we going?

187
00:08:44,096 --> 00:08:47,066
Just leave me the fuck alone.

188
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:48,428
Who you talking to?

189
00:08:49,835 --> 00:08:50,995
What?

190
00:08:52,671 --> 00:08:56,232
Vacu fela culay, you Jerry-
Lewis-liking motherfucker.

191
00:09:11,624 --> 00:09:12,925
Let's move it.

192
00:09:13,025 --> 00:09:14,356
Let me borrow your gun.

193
00:09:23,569 --> 00:09:25,628
Come to the back of the bus.

194
00:09:28,274 --> 00:09:31,766
You shut up and sit down.

195
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,349
What the hell wrong with you?

196
00:09:37,449 --> 00:09:38,818
I don't play that shit.

197
00:09:38,918 --> 00:09:40,519
Check my police record.

198
00:09:40,619 --> 00:09:42,314
You don't know
who you're messin' with.

199
00:09:45,324 --> 00:09:47,560
You better come to the back
before you get hurt.

200
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,184
Play that shit.

201
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:56,060
Wait till we get off the bus.

202
00:09:57,403 --> 00:09:58,771
I'm gonna kick your ass!

203
00:09:58,871 --> 00:10:00,236
Shut up!

204
00:10:07,947 --> 00:10:11,584
Where you from?
That French part of Compton?

205
00:10:11,684 --> 00:10:13,752
What's that you claiming?

206
00:10:13,852 --> 00:10:15,688
You don't know
who you're messing with.

207
00:10:15,788 --> 00:10:20,059
I'm deep in the streets.
I slap people for fun.

208
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:21,994
That's what I do.

209
00:10:22,094 --> 00:10:24,585
You want to play rough?

210
00:10:29,301 --> 00:10:31,496
I kill for fun.

211
00:11:53,218 --> 00:11:54,553
I ain't scared to go to jail.

212
00:11:54,653 --> 00:11:57,523
Take me to jail.
Would you speed up, please?

213
00:11:57,623 --> 00:11:58,757
I want to go back.

214
00:11:58,857 --> 00:12:00,125
All my cousins in there.

215
00:12:00,225 --> 00:12:02,193
I want to see all my friends.

216
00:12:34,927 --> 00:12:36,690
What are you doing up there?

217
00:13:15,634 --> 00:13:16,692
Raymond!

218
00:13:20,506 --> 00:13:22,174
Debray.

219
00:13:22,274 --> 00:13:24,105
Let's get out of here.

220
00:13:25,944 --> 00:13:27,446
No time.
We'll take him with us.

221
00:13:27,546 --> 00:13:29,415
We gotta go together.
We're a team.

222
00:13:29,515 --> 00:13:30,812
Move!

223
00:13:56,475 --> 00:13:57,703
We made it.

224
00:13:59,545 --> 00:14:01,035
Everybody OK?

225
00:14:04,049 --> 00:14:05,117
What it is.

226
00:14:05,217 --> 00:14:06,452
Drop me off over there.

227
00:14:06,552 --> 00:14:07,920
My cousin's house coming up.

228
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:10,989
Hover over the roof.
Y'all don't even have to stop.

229
00:14:11,089 --> 00:14:12,357
I can be out of here.

230
00:14:12,457 --> 00:14:14,493
I know y'all probably
got shit to do--

231
00:14:14,593 --> 00:14:15,661
Shut up!

232
00:14:15,761 --> 00:14:17,888
You can drop a brother off.
Y'all don't need me.

233
00:14:39,318 --> 00:14:40,785
Fifteen million.

234
00:14:43,989 --> 00:14:45,791
Cut a brother in on that.

235
00:14:45,891 --> 00:14:47,559
Let me be down.

236
00:14:47,659 --> 00:14:49,194
We'll split it three ways.

237
00:14:49,294 --> 00:14:53,599
Seven for me, seven for you,
and you get whatever's left...

238
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:55,257
'cause you been trippin'
since I met you.

239
00:14:56,768 --> 00:14:58,770
What you doing with the ax?

240
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,072
Forget about what I said.

241
00:15:00,172 --> 00:15:02,474
I don't know shit about
no $15 million in no Jaguar.

242
00:15:02,574 --> 00:15:04,643
I don't even know where we at.
I got a bad memory.

243
00:15:04,743 --> 00:15:06,745
-Be still.
-Put the ax down.

244
00:15:06,845 --> 00:15:07,869
Don't move.

245
00:15:14,753 --> 00:15:16,588
What's wrong with you?

246
00:15:16,688 --> 00:15:18,178
Trying to cut
a brother's hand off.

247
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:22,227
Always trying to kill somebody.

248
00:15:22,327 --> 00:15:24,029
Why don't you try
loving somebody?

249
00:15:24,129 --> 00:15:25,994
What did you open the door for?

250
00:15:33,238 --> 00:15:36,041
Y'all trippin'.
You want some girls?

251
00:15:36,141 --> 00:15:38,666
I can get you any kind
of girl--black, Japanese.

252
00:15:41,046 --> 00:15:43,482
I can take you over
to my grandmama house.

253
00:15:43,582 --> 00:15:46,210
She cook you some chicken,
some cornbread, some poulet.

254
00:16:30,462 --> 00:16:31,863
It's cold.

255
00:16:31,963 --> 00:16:34,032
It's colder than a motherfucker.

256
00:16:34,132 --> 00:16:35,567
A serious crime.

257
00:16:35,667 --> 00:16:36,902
Justified punishment.

258
00:16:37,002 --> 00:16:40,339
This is James Russell
reporting.

259
00:16:40,439 --> 00:16:44,743
That's some hard-hitting stuff.
John Tesh school of journalism.

260
00:16:44,843 --> 00:16:47,579
Barclay, just watch it
one more time before you decide.

261
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:48,747
Why? Nobody else will.

262
00:16:48,847 --> 00:16:51,250
Who gives a rat's ass
about some two-bit hustler?

263
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:54,086
The people getting ripped off
give a rat's ass.

264
00:16:54,186 --> 00:16:56,722
You're just another walking
head shot, aren't you?

265
00:16:56,822 --> 00:17:00,626
Another pretty boy wanker
masquerading as a reporter.

266
00:17:00,726 --> 00:17:02,728
I don't need this bullshit.

267
00:17:02,828 --> 00:17:05,297
This is the skinny.
You're fired.

268
00:17:05,397 --> 00:17:07,490
Have your stuff out by Monday.

269
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,036
Be brief.

270
00:17:11,136 --> 00:17:14,640
What part of "you're fired"
don't you understand?

271
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:18,510
Not you, you asshole.
I'm talking to somebody else.

272
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:19,634
What?

273
00:17:20,912 --> 00:17:22,681
Tragedy and terror
strike the Southland.

274
00:17:22,781 --> 00:17:24,283
Good afternoon.

275
00:17:24,383 --> 00:17:26,752
A bus delivering prisoners from
the men's central lockup...

276
00:17:26,852 --> 00:17:29,288
to the Van Nuys courthouse
was destroyed...

277
00:17:29,388 --> 00:17:32,758
on the First Street bridge
in downtown Los Angeles.

278
00:17:32,858 --> 00:17:36,728
Fourteen prisoners and
two policemen were killed...

279
00:17:36,828 --> 00:17:40,465
in what authorities describe
as a commando-style raid.

280
00:17:40,565 --> 00:17:42,601
All bodies
have been accounted for...

281
00:17:42,701 --> 00:17:44,836
with the exception
of two prisoners.

282
00:17:44,936 --> 00:17:48,140
Witnesses saw the two men
boarding a helicopter...

283
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,808
shortly after the bus
exploded into flames.

284
00:17:49,908 --> 00:17:53,679
The two fugitives are wanted
in connection with the murders.

285
00:17:53,779 --> 00:17:56,373
This has got sweeps week
written all over it.

286
00:17:58,517 --> 00:18:00,747
Let me know how it turns out.

287
00:18:01,953 --> 00:18:06,925
On the left is a John Doe
police arrested at L.A.X...

288
00:18:07,025 --> 00:18:09,261
for possession
of a counterfeit passport.

289
00:18:09,361 --> 00:18:12,264
And on the right,
Franklin Maurice Hatchett...

290
00:18:12,364 --> 00:18:14,566
a local street hustler
with suspected gang ties...

291
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:15,934
who was en route to Van Nuys...

292
00:18:16,034 --> 00:18:19,404
to be arraigned on charges
of soliciting goods.

293
00:18:19,504 --> 00:18:22,708
The two fugitives
are considered dangerous.

294
00:18:22,808 --> 00:18:25,977
Fourteen prisoners due to face
a Van Nuys judge today...

295
00:18:26,077 --> 00:18:29,614
now face the ultimate
judgment day of all--

296
00:18:29,714 --> 00:18:32,205
one where sentencing comes
with no chance of reversal.

297
00:18:33,585 --> 00:18:35,212
Freeze!

298
00:18:40,725 --> 00:18:43,562
Come out with
your hands above your head!

299
00:18:43,662 --> 00:18:45,254
I'm gonna come out,
but I didn't do it!

300
00:18:46,932 --> 00:18:48,092
Don't shoot!

301
00:18:59,611 --> 00:19:01,579
I didn't kill no cops!

302
00:19:52,998 --> 00:19:54,158
Is this James Russell?

303
00:19:56,601 --> 00:19:58,068
I'm on my way.

304
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,913
I cannot wait for you
to eat my ass.

305
00:20:18,223 --> 00:20:20,487
Here it is.

306
00:20:30,735 --> 00:20:32,404
Good afternoon.
I'm Detective Pickett...

307
00:20:32,504 --> 00:20:33,672
and this is Williams.

308
00:20:33,772 --> 00:20:36,206
I wondered if we might chat
about Franklin Hatchett.

309
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:39,010
Franklin's not here.

310
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,846
We're dealing
with a multiple homicide.

311
00:20:40,946 --> 00:20:41,847
Would you just open the door?

312
00:20:41,947 --> 00:20:43,281
Excuse you?

313
00:20:43,381 --> 00:20:45,050
I'm sorry. Listen...

314
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:47,452
it would only take
a few minutes of your time.

315
00:20:47,552 --> 00:20:48,985
We'd really appreciate it.

316
00:20:50,121 --> 00:20:51,816
Please?

317
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:00,993
Thank you so much.

318
00:21:08,106 --> 00:21:09,835
When was the last time
you spoke to him?

319
00:21:11,476 --> 00:21:15,347
He left on the freak train
to Atlanta six weeks ago.

320
00:21:15,447 --> 00:21:18,450
I haven't seen him since.

321
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:20,819
Do you think this is funny?

322
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:22,687
I got a busload of bodies
and a couple dead cops...

323
00:21:22,787 --> 00:21:24,656
because of your gangbanger.

324
00:21:24,756 --> 00:21:26,057
Franklin ain't no banger.

325
00:21:26,157 --> 00:21:28,727
If I find out
you're helping him...

326
00:21:28,827 --> 00:21:30,428
I'm going
to make your life miserable.

327
00:21:30,528 --> 00:21:32,831
Back off, please.

328
00:21:32,931 --> 00:21:34,592
Treat the lady with respect.

329
00:21:36,234 --> 00:21:38,336
Can you help us out, Paula?

330
00:21:38,436 --> 00:21:41,339
I swear,
I don't know where he is.

331
00:21:41,439 --> 00:21:43,339
This is such bullshit!

332
00:21:45,176 --> 00:21:46,711
You know...

333
00:21:46,811 --> 00:21:48,480
It's OK.

334
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:51,349
All I'm saying is
if he tries to contact you...

335
00:21:51,449 --> 00:21:52,817
give me a call.

336
00:21:52,917 --> 00:21:55,420
It's so much better
if he turns himself in.

337
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,557
He stays out on the street,
he's gonna get himself killed.

338
00:21:58,657 --> 00:22:01,359
I'm trying to protect him.

339
00:22:01,459 --> 00:22:03,290
This is my card.

340
00:22:05,997 --> 00:22:07,430
Will you give me a holler?

341
00:22:10,435 --> 00:22:11,902
Thank you.

342
00:22:27,419 --> 00:22:29,487
Keep it running.

343
00:22:29,587 --> 00:22:31,612
This might be quick.

344
00:22:46,471 --> 00:22:47,631
White boy.

345
00:22:56,047 --> 00:22:57,549
What the fuck was that for?

346
00:22:57,649 --> 00:22:59,117
That's for getting me busted.

347
00:22:59,217 --> 00:23:00,552
What you bring a gun for?

348
00:23:00,652 --> 00:23:03,121
'Cause you're wanted for murder.

349
00:23:03,221 --> 00:23:04,723
I ain't murdered
no-goddamn-body.

350
00:23:04,823 --> 00:23:05,991
I don't know that.

351
00:23:06,091 --> 00:23:07,292
Now you know.

352
00:23:07,392 --> 00:23:09,027
'Cause if I could,
I'd murder your ass right now...

353
00:23:09,127 --> 00:23:10,629
coming down here with a gun.

354
00:23:10,729 --> 00:23:11,796
Guns don't kill people.

355
00:23:11,896 --> 00:23:14,165
Stupid motherfuckers
with guns kill people.

356
00:23:14,265 --> 00:23:16,001
I'm enlightened.

357
00:23:16,101 --> 00:23:17,602
Let me enlighten your ass.

358
00:23:17,702 --> 00:23:19,904
Bring your monkey ass up here.

359
00:23:20,004 --> 00:23:21,673
Got me running
all over goddamn town.

360
00:23:21,773 --> 00:23:23,942
People shooting at me and shit.

361
00:23:24,042 --> 00:23:26,077
You the one got me in this shit.

362
00:23:26,177 --> 00:23:28,668
Ought to kick your ass
in the head.

363
00:23:30,215 --> 00:23:31,483
Freezing.

364
00:23:31,583 --> 00:23:33,551
I know. I was
in the motherfucker earlier.

365
00:23:37,689 --> 00:23:40,625
Listen to me.
I want an exclusive.

366
00:23:40,725 --> 00:23:42,627
A what?

367
00:23:42,727 --> 00:23:44,562
The entire city
is looking for your ass.

368
00:23:44,662 --> 00:23:46,331
The cops want payback.

369
00:23:46,431 --> 00:23:49,200
How many times I got to tell you
I didn't kill no-goddamn-body?

370
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,825
Regardless,
they want your ass dead.

371
00:23:53,104 --> 00:23:55,240
Franklin, I will protect you.

372
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:58,476
I'll get you turned in,
let you tell your story...

373
00:23:58,576 --> 00:24:00,679
but I want the exclusive.

374
00:24:00,779 --> 00:24:04,783
I'll hide you for the weekend.
It'll all be over on Monday.

375
00:24:04,883 --> 00:24:06,685
I don't trust your ass.

376
00:24:06,785 --> 00:24:09,621
How I know this exclusive shit
gonna clear my name?

377
00:24:09,721 --> 00:24:11,256
I guess you don't.

378
00:24:11,356 --> 00:24:13,892
But without me,
you'll probably end up dead.

379
00:24:13,992 --> 00:24:16,327
They need someone to blame.

380
00:24:16,427 --> 00:24:17,689
Right now, it's you.

381
00:24:20,331 --> 00:24:21,800
What do you say?

382
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,536
I ain't staying
in this neighborhood.

383
00:24:24,636 --> 00:24:26,337
I can't stay here
for no two days.

384
00:24:26,437 --> 00:24:28,139
That's right. You can't.

385
00:24:28,239 --> 00:24:29,574
What you talkin' about?

386
00:24:29,674 --> 00:24:31,476
You're coming to my wedding.

387
00:24:31,576 --> 00:24:34,379
Your wedding? Shit! Hell, no.

388
00:24:34,479 --> 00:24:36,381
I ain't going nowhere.
Po-po looking for me.

389
00:24:36,481 --> 00:24:39,551
Trying to kill me?
Staying on the low-low.

390
00:24:39,651 --> 00:24:41,352
God damn.

391
00:24:41,452 --> 00:24:42,887
How you do that?

392
00:24:42,987 --> 00:24:44,489
Did a report once
on escape artists...

393
00:24:44,589 --> 00:24:46,758
and the women who love them.

394
00:24:46,858 --> 00:24:48,827
Teach me how to do that shit.

395
00:24:48,927 --> 00:24:50,028
There's no time.

396
00:24:50,128 --> 00:24:52,430
We got time.

397
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:56,968
I need you to take a shower,
shave, lose the earring...

398
00:24:57,068 --> 00:25:00,472
and, please, do something
about that hair of yours.

399
00:25:00,572 --> 00:25:02,707
What you talkin' about?
My 'do is tight.

400
00:25:02,807 --> 00:25:06,077
Every cop in the city
is looking for that tight 'do.

401
00:25:06,177 --> 00:25:09,080
I'll hook up the hair, but
I ain't touching the earring...

402
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,782
'cause I'm still a player!

403
00:25:10,882 --> 00:25:13,051
I'm gonna make a phone call.

404
00:25:13,151 --> 00:25:15,286
I don't think
there's any hot water left.

405
00:25:15,386 --> 00:25:16,454
What?

406
00:25:16,554 --> 00:25:18,389
You heard me.

407
00:25:18,489 --> 00:25:21,424
Punk-ass white boy.
This tub better be clean.

408
00:25:25,697 --> 00:25:26,765
Who is it?

409
00:25:26,865 --> 00:25:29,167
Barclay, it's James.
How you doing?

410
00:25:29,267 --> 00:25:31,636
I got Franklin Hatchett.

411
00:25:31,736 --> 00:25:34,439
Don't play games with me.

412
00:25:34,539 --> 00:25:36,441
Words like that give me
a stiffy.

413
00:25:36,541 --> 00:25:38,343
At my age, I can't waste them.

414
00:25:38,443 --> 00:25:42,539
I'm not kidding you.
He's at my place safe and sound.

415
00:25:44,315 --> 00:25:46,551
Congratulations.
You're rehired.

416
00:25:46,651 --> 00:25:48,553
I thought I was supposed
to clear out by Monday.

417
00:25:48,653 --> 00:25:50,054
Didn't you say that?

418
00:25:50,154 --> 00:25:53,258
You didn't really take
me seriously, did you?

419
00:25:53,358 --> 00:25:57,262
You're Pulitzer material.
I've always said that.

420
00:25:57,362 --> 00:25:59,931
I'll send a camera crew...

421
00:26:00,031 --> 00:26:02,567
down to the 20th precinct
in an hour.

422
00:26:02,667 --> 00:26:05,670
Not a chance. I'm going
to keep him until Monday.

423
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:06,971
For sweeps week.

424
00:26:07,071 --> 00:26:09,240
Don't be foolish.

425
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:11,242
A bird in the hand
is worth a 10-share...

426
00:26:11,342 --> 00:26:12,410
for the whole weekend.

427
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:15,146
Fuck you.

428
00:26:15,246 --> 00:26:17,215
This is my story,
and you know it.

429
00:26:17,315 --> 00:26:20,341
You're right. Monday it is.

430
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,221
Loser.

431
00:26:23,321 --> 00:26:24,222
Freeze!

432
00:26:24,322 --> 00:26:25,323
Vic Damone...

433
00:26:25,423 --> 00:26:27,992
Get your hands on the car!

434
00:26:28,092 --> 00:26:31,396
Vic Damone--
his music will last forever.

435
00:26:31,496 --> 00:26:35,200
What the hell is a Vic Damone?

436
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,235
Vic Damone's Greatest Hits...

437
00:26:37,335 --> 00:26:39,337
Ain't no greatest hit.
I ain't never heard it.

438
00:26:39,437 --> 00:26:40,839
He thrilled the world...

439
00:26:40,939 --> 00:26:43,041
when he married
actress Diahann Carroll.

440
00:26:43,141 --> 00:26:44,876
Now he'll thrill you again...

441
00:26:44,976 --> 00:26:47,512
How the hell an ltalian get
a fine black woman like that?

442
00:26:47,612 --> 00:26:50,248
The timeless hits
of Vic Damone.

443
00:26:50,348 --> 00:26:52,116
He can't sing.

444
00:26:52,216 --> 00:26:54,352
Only reason she married him
'cause he got money.

445
00:26:54,452 --> 00:26:55,783
Takin' all our sisters.

446
00:27:05,163 --> 00:27:06,564
I'm James Russell.

447
00:27:06,664 --> 00:27:08,132
Those stories
along with Andy Rooney...

448
00:27:08,232 --> 00:27:10,826
tonight on 60 minutes.

449
00:27:18,076 --> 00:27:19,043
I'm out the door.

450
00:27:19,143 --> 00:27:21,045
People are already showing up.

451
00:27:21,145 --> 00:27:23,648
I am so sorry.
Something important came up.

452
00:27:23,748 --> 00:27:25,817
More important
than our rehearsal dinner?

453
00:27:25,917 --> 00:27:27,252
Of course not.

454
00:27:27,352 --> 00:27:29,988
And I'm bringing
somebody with me.

455
00:27:30,088 --> 00:27:31,556
Who?

456
00:27:31,656 --> 00:27:34,192
Old, dear friend of mine
from college.

457
00:27:34,292 --> 00:27:36,194
Just kind of ran into him today.

458
00:27:36,294 --> 00:27:38,696
Are you all right?
You sound funny.

459
00:27:38,796 --> 00:27:41,299
I'm perfect.

460
00:27:41,399 --> 00:27:42,667
I'll see you soon.
I love you.

461
00:27:42,767 --> 00:27:44,335
I love you, too. Hurry up.

462
00:27:44,435 --> 00:27:47,336
Fuck me.

463
00:27:49,874 --> 00:27:52,810
I'm gonna start the car.
I'll meet you in the courtyard.

464
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:54,078
Kiss my ass!

465
00:27:54,178 --> 00:27:57,148
Find something that fits
then move your ass! We're late!

466
00:27:57,248 --> 00:28:00,411
This tub wasn't clean,
you dirty-ass white boy!

467
00:28:05,089 --> 00:28:06,658
You had to pick that one,
didn't you?

468
00:28:06,758 --> 00:28:07,992
This your ride?

469
00:28:08,092 --> 00:28:10,395
Yes, and that's my favorite
fucking suit you're wearing.

470
00:28:10,495 --> 00:28:12,030
I look good, don't l?

471
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:15,767
Don't get mad 'cause I look
better than you in your shit.

472
00:28:15,867 --> 00:28:18,269
I should be
Ebony Man of the Month.

473
00:28:18,369 --> 00:28:20,004
Is that something
to be proud of?

474
00:28:20,104 --> 00:28:22,407
You wouldn't know nothin'
about that with your goofy ass.

475
00:28:22,507 --> 00:28:26,177
You fuck up the suit,
and we got a problem.

476
00:28:26,277 --> 00:28:28,404
We already got a problem.

477
00:28:33,918 --> 00:28:35,653
Look at this shit!

478
00:28:35,753 --> 00:28:38,389
You hustlin' son of a bitch.

479
00:28:38,489 --> 00:28:39,891
Look who's talking.

480
00:28:39,991 --> 00:28:41,359
At least I've worked
for everything I have.

481
00:28:41,459 --> 00:28:44,595
You worked yourself
right into some rich pussy.

482
00:28:44,695 --> 00:28:46,564
No wonder you don't give
a damn if I'm innocent.

483
00:28:46,664 --> 00:28:48,032
Your ass gonna get
married and retire.

484
00:28:48,132 --> 00:28:50,668
Let's get things straight
about tonight's dinner.

485
00:28:50,768 --> 00:28:52,804
You don't speak
unless spoken to.

486
00:28:52,904 --> 00:28:54,806
You stay by my side.

487
00:28:54,906 --> 00:28:56,975
If you try
anything fucked up or funny...

488
00:28:57,075 --> 00:28:59,043
I will kill you myself.

489
00:28:59,143 --> 00:29:00,872
Just like you did
back on the docks?

490
00:29:03,981 --> 00:29:05,416
I will beat your ass.

491
00:29:05,516 --> 00:29:06,813
You ain't beatin' shit, homes.

492
00:29:12,657 --> 00:29:15,293
We went to Stanford,
which is where?

493
00:29:15,393 --> 00:29:16,961
How the hell I supposed to know?

494
00:29:17,061 --> 00:29:19,430
It's in the Bay Area, where you
graduated with honors in '88.

495
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:24,435
And your name tonight
is Jonathan Smith.

496
00:29:24,535 --> 00:29:25,670
Fuck the Jonathan Smith.

497
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:27,260
I'm me.

498
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,908
Do not say a word about
my fiancée's weight.

499
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:33,111
She's very sensitive about that.

500
00:29:33,211 --> 00:29:35,079
You must have one
of them fat-assed

501
00:29:35,179 --> 00:29:38,783
Taco Bell, McDonald-eatin',
big-booty-assed--

502
00:29:38,883 --> 00:29:39,784
Mr. Cipriani.

503
00:29:39,884 --> 00:29:41,285
How are you?

504
00:29:41,385 --> 00:29:43,154
How many times I got to
tell you? Call me Dad.

505
00:29:43,254 --> 00:29:45,757
-You're not getting nervous?
-Who wouldn't be?

506
00:29:45,857 --> 00:29:47,291
That's true. Who's this?

507
00:29:47,391 --> 00:29:49,227
This is
a very good friend of mine.

508
00:29:49,327 --> 00:29:50,419
Vic Damone.

509
00:29:51,796 --> 00:29:52,956
Junior.

510
00:29:55,066 --> 00:29:58,069
He's Diahann Carroll's kid
and Vic Damone's kid.

511
00:29:58,169 --> 00:29:59,570
So you're half and half ltalian.

512
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:02,340
Hey, paisan.

513
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,705
Me and your father?
Forget about it. Come here.

514
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:11,816
Mamma mia!

515
00:30:11,916 --> 00:30:14,385
God, your house...

516
00:30:14,485 --> 00:30:16,254
Magnifico!

517
00:30:16,354 --> 00:30:18,589
Molto bella!
Tutti frutti!

518
00:30:18,689 --> 00:30:20,625
Where'd you learn
to talk ltalian?

519
00:30:20,725 --> 00:30:22,393
Did Vic talk to you in ltalian
when you were a kid?

520
00:30:22,493 --> 00:30:23,561
All the time.

521
00:30:23,661 --> 00:30:25,129
Here she is!

522
00:30:25,229 --> 00:30:27,799
It's nice of you to show up.

523
00:30:27,899 --> 00:30:30,301
I'm terribly sorry.

524
00:30:30,401 --> 00:30:34,072
Fiancée Grace,
this is my friend Vic.

525
00:30:34,172 --> 00:30:36,470
You're phat.

526
00:30:43,648 --> 00:30:46,384
P-h-a-t--
Pretty, hot, and tempting.

527
00:30:46,484 --> 00:30:47,952
I'm stunned by your phatness.

528
00:30:48,052 --> 00:30:51,556
You're a lucky man to have
such a phat-ass fiancée.

529
00:30:51,656 --> 00:30:52,816
She fine.

530
00:30:53,824 --> 00:30:54,892
Thanks.

531
00:30:54,992 --> 00:30:55,981
You're welcome.

532
00:30:58,563 --> 00:30:59,964
You made it.

533
00:31:00,064 --> 00:31:01,966
I thought you'd be off
covering that prison escape...

534
00:31:02,066 --> 00:31:03,801
with the rest of
the low-life sensationalists.

535
00:31:03,901 --> 00:31:05,203
Mother, give it a rest.

536
00:31:05,303 --> 00:31:08,439
Actually, I am covering that
sort of indirectly, Mom.

537
00:31:08,539 --> 00:31:10,274
How many times do
I have to tell you...

538
00:31:10,374 --> 00:31:12,009
to call me Mrs. Cipriani?

539
00:31:12,109 --> 00:31:15,913
Connie, this is Vic Damone Jr.
He's Jimmy's good friend.

540
00:31:16,013 --> 00:31:18,449
Tell us what it was like
growing up in show biz.

541
00:31:18,549 --> 00:31:19,917
Everybody's interested.

542
00:31:20,017 --> 00:31:21,752
I had a lot of friends.

543
00:31:21,852 --> 00:31:24,555
Junior Walker Jr.,
Sammy Davis Jr. Jr.

544
00:31:24,655 --> 00:31:26,591
We hang out all the time.

545
00:31:26,691 --> 00:31:30,294
And what do you do now,
Mr. Damone Jr.?

546
00:31:30,394 --> 00:31:32,563
-I'm in--
-Sales.

547
00:31:32,663 --> 00:31:34,398
-Retail?
-Seats.

548
00:31:34,498 --> 00:31:35,833
On the stock exchange.

549
00:31:35,933 --> 00:31:37,668
-Broker?
-Ticket scalper.

550
00:31:37,768 --> 00:31:40,404
I can get you anything if you
let me know ahead of time.

551
00:31:40,504 --> 00:31:41,439
He's a funny guy.

552
00:31:41,539 --> 00:31:45,376
He's hysterical. Kills me.

553
00:31:45,476 --> 00:31:47,945
How about
some nice Dom Pérignon '85?

554
00:31:48,045 --> 00:31:50,639
How about some Colt .45?

555
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:55,286
Would you excuse me
for one second?

556
00:31:55,386 --> 00:31:56,819
I need to talk to you.

557
00:32:01,859 --> 00:32:03,827
What the fuck do you think
you're doing?

558
00:32:03,927 --> 00:32:06,297
I'm mingling
with the rich folks.

559
00:32:06,397 --> 00:32:08,666
I'm locking your ass
in the fucking closet...

560
00:32:08,766 --> 00:32:09,900
for the rest of the weekend.

561
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,602
Don't even start with me.

562
00:32:11,702 --> 00:32:13,537
You the one
brought me out here...

563
00:32:13,637 --> 00:32:15,840
in Beverly Hills mingling
with these uppity-ass people.

564
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:18,476
I'm wanted for murder,
my life on the line--

565
00:32:18,576 --> 00:32:19,941
What about my life?

566
00:32:21,378 --> 00:32:23,380
I'm lookin' at your life.

567
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:27,177
Grace! What's up?

568
00:32:28,252 --> 00:32:29,742
This is beautiful.

569
00:32:31,555 --> 00:32:33,491
I couldn't be happier
for you and James.

570
00:32:33,591 --> 00:32:35,860
It's about time
he settled down...

571
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,628
after all the women
he been through.

572
00:32:37,728 --> 00:32:39,363
And those twins in school
wasn't his.

573
00:32:39,463 --> 00:32:40,865
That was all a lie.

574
00:32:40,965 --> 00:32:42,366
He had a lot of women.

575
00:32:42,466 --> 00:32:43,968
He had all the women.

576
00:32:44,068 --> 00:32:47,505
All the women, all the guys,
I fucked them all.

577
00:32:47,605 --> 00:32:49,573
Here we go.

578
00:32:49,673 --> 00:32:51,442
I'd like to propose a toast.

579
00:32:51,542 --> 00:32:53,444
Ladies and gentlemen!

580
00:32:53,544 --> 00:32:55,813
Everybody!

581
00:32:55,913 --> 00:32:57,014
I'm going to propose a toast!

582
00:32:57,114 --> 00:32:58,706
This is Vic Damone's son.

583
00:33:04,021 --> 00:33:05,989
If you don't mind.

584
00:33:11,562 --> 00:33:15,521
You're James' first,
his last, his everything.

585
00:33:16,667 --> 00:33:18,464
And you're the answer
to all his dreams.

586
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:24,241
You're his sun, his moon,
his guiding star.

587
00:33:24,341 --> 00:33:26,177
You're kind of wonderful,
that's what you are.

588
00:33:26,277 --> 00:33:29,547
He knows
there's only one of you...

589
00:33:29,647 --> 00:33:31,882
Isn't that Barry White?

590
00:33:31,982 --> 00:33:35,042
There's no way
he could have made two.

591
00:33:36,587 --> 00:33:37,918
You're all he's living for.

592
00:33:39,356 --> 00:33:40,891
Your love...

593
00:33:40,991 --> 00:33:42,193
he'll keep forevermore.

594
00:33:42,293 --> 00:33:44,829
You're his first...

595
00:33:44,929 --> 00:33:47,164
his last...

596
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:48,822
his everything.

597
00:33:59,443 --> 00:34:00,878
That was beautiful.

598
00:34:00,978 --> 00:34:03,276
I do what I can do
when I can do it.

599
00:34:04,848 --> 00:34:06,713
Congratulations.

600
00:34:09,186 --> 00:34:11,021
You got a phone?

601
00:34:11,121 --> 00:34:12,281
Thank you.

602
00:34:13,857 --> 00:34:16,060
You can see
this kid is ltalian.

603
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,752
He feels deep.

604
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:34,245
Hey, baby, what's up?
It's me.

605
00:34:34,345 --> 00:34:35,813
Don't you "baby, it's me" me.

606
00:34:35,913 --> 00:34:38,449
I saw your ass on the news,
talking you killed some cop.

607
00:34:38,549 --> 00:34:39,450
What?

608
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:40,718
I just saw you on the news.

609
00:34:40,818 --> 00:34:42,586
I didn't kill nobody!

610
00:34:42,686 --> 00:34:44,288
You killed some cop!

611
00:34:44,388 --> 00:34:46,991
Once again, you are in trouble!
What did you do anyway?

612
00:34:47,091 --> 00:34:49,793
Don't yell at me!
Are you gonna let me talk?

613
00:34:49,893 --> 00:34:53,297
Listen!
Stop watching the goddamn news!

614
00:34:53,397 --> 00:34:54,798
Somebody set me up!

615
00:34:54,898 --> 00:34:56,467
Where have you been
for the last 24 hours?

616
00:34:56,567 --> 00:34:58,135
You better not be over
no girl's house!

617
00:34:58,235 --> 00:35:01,205
I ain't over
at no goddamn girl's house!

618
00:35:01,305 --> 00:35:03,841
I'm wanted! I ain't got time
to get no pussy!

619
00:35:03,941 --> 00:35:05,374
I ain't fuckin' nobody but you.

620
00:35:07,177 --> 00:35:09,013
What about this guy named
Carmine called here...

621
00:35:09,113 --> 00:35:12,708
saying he's gonna kill us
if you don't give him $25,000?

622
00:35:14,084 --> 00:35:16,153
I don't owe him
no goddamn $25,000!

623
00:35:16,253 --> 00:35:17,388
We got him.

624
00:35:17,488 --> 00:35:20,257
He's calling from
a 310 area code, a 274 prefix.

625
00:35:20,357 --> 00:35:21,892
What's he doing
in Beverly Hills?

626
00:35:21,992 --> 00:35:23,761
Lock the doors
and don't answer the phone...

627
00:35:23,861 --> 00:35:24,995
and get under the bed!

628
00:35:25,095 --> 00:35:26,497
I'm on my way!

629
00:35:26,597 --> 00:35:27,928
Get under the--

630
00:35:31,001 --> 00:35:33,804
Somebody bothering you?

631
00:35:33,904 --> 00:35:35,773
Everything's cool.

632
00:35:35,873 --> 00:35:38,309
Frank Sinatra Jr.
got in trouble again.

633
00:35:38,409 --> 00:35:40,277
They got it down
to a one-block radius.

634
00:35:40,377 --> 00:35:44,815
He's on Roxbury
between Sunset and Lexington.

635
00:35:44,915 --> 00:35:46,314
They're gonna check on it.

636
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:49,586
Where do you think you're going?

637
00:35:49,686 --> 00:35:51,455
I'm leaving. I'm out.

638
00:35:51,555 --> 00:35:52,756
You're out?

639
00:35:52,856 --> 00:35:54,756
Who'd you call, your partner?

640
00:35:55,292 --> 00:35:56,961
Partner? What the hell
you talkin' about?

641
00:35:57,061 --> 00:35:58,462
I called my girl.

642
00:35:58,562 --> 00:36:01,031
She's pregnant,
and she needs me, and I'm out.

643
00:36:01,131 --> 00:36:02,700
That is not part of our deal!

644
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,301
Damn our deal!

645
00:36:04,401 --> 00:36:05,803
I ain't dealin' my life away.

646
00:36:05,903 --> 00:36:09,139
Why you hustling me?
Why you won't just turn me in?

647
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:10,574
What you waitin' on?

648
00:36:10,674 --> 00:36:11,842
I thought so.

649
00:36:11,942 --> 00:36:13,177
This is bullshit.
You got me running--

650
00:36:13,277 --> 00:36:15,813
I'm helping you.
You gotta help me, too.

651
00:36:15,913 --> 00:36:17,281
I need your story
live on Monday.

652
00:36:17,381 --> 00:36:18,848
It's sweeps week.

653
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:21,318
Fuck sweeps week!

654
00:36:21,418 --> 00:36:22,653
I'm wanted for murder...

655
00:36:22,753 --> 00:36:24,755
you talking about
a goddamn broom !

656
00:36:24,855 --> 00:36:26,379
Get me a taxi!

657
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:34,657
What is your sweeps week thing
again?

658
00:36:37,101 --> 00:36:38,762
You didn't tell me
where you're going.

659
00:36:40,037 --> 00:36:41,805
You have to trust me.
I'm onto something big.

660
00:36:41,905 --> 00:36:43,307
What am I
going to tell everybody?

661
00:36:43,407 --> 00:36:44,541
You'll think of something.

662
00:36:44,641 --> 00:36:46,268
I'll be back
first thing in the morning.

663
00:36:48,645 --> 00:36:50,010
I love you.

664
00:36:53,984 --> 00:36:55,144
I know.

665
00:36:57,621 --> 00:36:58,889
You better not be lying to me.

666
00:36:58,989 --> 00:37:00,858
What the hell
I got to lie to you for?

667
00:37:00,958 --> 00:37:02,693
I happen to know
how your type operates.

668
00:37:02,793 --> 00:37:03,927
My type?

669
00:37:04,027 --> 00:37:05,262
Why the hell you take my type...

670
00:37:05,362 --> 00:37:07,464
to your goddamn dinner
rehearsal for a damn story?

671
00:37:07,564 --> 00:37:08,966
I'm stuck with you.

672
00:37:09,066 --> 00:37:10,901
I figured your white ass out.

673
00:37:11,001 --> 00:37:12,236
You have?

674
00:37:12,336 --> 00:37:13,370
You're full of shit.

675
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:15,773
You one desperate-ass
middle-class white boy...

676
00:37:15,873 --> 00:37:18,308
that don't give a damn who you
step on to get what you want.

677
00:37:18,408 --> 00:37:19,943
Get your priorities straight.

678
00:37:20,043 --> 00:37:20,944
My priorities?

679
00:37:21,044 --> 00:37:22,479
Your goddamn priorities.

680
00:37:22,579 --> 00:37:24,281
I'm not the one
wanted for murder.

681
00:37:24,381 --> 00:37:26,550
I'm sick
of your smart-ass comments.

682
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:28,352
You know I ain't murdered
no-goddamn-body.

683
00:37:28,452 --> 00:37:30,320
You the reason
why I'm in this shit.

684
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:32,656
I was minding my own business...

685
00:37:32,756 --> 00:37:34,925
Iiving ghetto fabulous,
I wasn't messin' with nobody.

686
00:37:35,025 --> 00:37:36,393
You fucked that up.

687
00:37:36,493 --> 00:37:38,695
You know how much money I was
making down at that car wash?

688
00:37:38,795 --> 00:37:40,330
A buck, 2.98?

689
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:42,232
I will slap the hell outta you.

690
00:37:42,332 --> 00:37:44,201
You don't know
who you messin' with.

691
00:37:44,301 --> 00:37:47,204
I don't even know
when I'm gonna slap somebody.

692
00:37:47,304 --> 00:37:49,339
I be like, "Why did I do that?"

693
00:37:49,439 --> 00:37:51,975
I don't know
when I be slappin' people.

694
00:37:52,075 --> 00:37:53,410
Keep messin' with me.
I'm dangerous.

695
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:54,945
I'm scared of myself.

696
00:37:55,045 --> 00:37:56,313
They call me "snap and pop..."

697
00:37:56,413 --> 00:37:58,382
'cause I'll snap
and pop your ass in the mouth.

698
00:37:58,482 --> 00:38:01,652
Don't mess with me.
Better watch your back.

699
00:38:01,752 --> 00:38:04,121
Even in the shower,
eatin' at picnics...

700
00:38:04,221 --> 00:38:05,950
you better watch your
goddamn back. Make a right.

701
00:38:10,894 --> 00:38:13,063
There's my crib.

702
00:38:13,163 --> 00:38:15,290
And there goes your stakeout.

703
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,368
Turn down here.
I know a shortcut.

704
00:38:28,145 --> 00:38:29,480
She just turned the lights out.

705
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:31,070
You're up, sport.

706
00:38:49,099 --> 00:38:50,801
What the hell is
wrong with you? It's me!

707
00:38:50,901 --> 00:38:53,270
Don't take that tone with me.

708
00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:56,106
I should crack
your thick-ass skull right now.

709
00:38:56,206 --> 00:38:57,808
Leaving me here all alone!

710
00:38:57,908 --> 00:38:59,810
Is this the kind of father
that you're gonna be?

711
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:01,945
I'll move back to Riverside.

712
00:39:02,045 --> 00:39:03,313
Don't think that I won't.

713
00:39:03,413 --> 00:39:04,815
Would you calm down?

714
00:39:04,915 --> 00:39:06,884
What's up with the hair
and that suit?

715
00:39:06,984 --> 00:39:09,019
You look like you stepped out
of a casket!

716
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:11,155
Calm down!

717
00:39:11,255 --> 00:39:13,657
You know I ain't killed nobody.

718
00:39:13,757 --> 00:39:15,122
It's me.

719
00:39:17,694 --> 00:39:18,762
You know I need you.

720
00:39:18,862 --> 00:39:21,231
Why you think
I came over here so fast?

721
00:39:21,331 --> 00:39:23,734
I'm worried about you.

722
00:39:23,834 --> 00:39:25,169
I'm sorry.

723
00:39:25,269 --> 00:39:26,463
You know I love you.

724
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:37,476
She just
turned the lights back on.

725
00:39:38,815 --> 00:39:40,584
Let's go.

726
00:39:40,684 --> 00:39:42,619
Who is this?

727
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:43,854
And what is he doing here?

728
00:39:43,954 --> 00:39:44,855
That's--

729
00:39:44,955 --> 00:39:46,089
James Russell,
Channel 12 News.

730
00:39:46,189 --> 00:39:48,025
The weatherman?
What are you doing with him?

731
00:39:48,125 --> 00:39:50,027
That's just my white friend.

732
00:39:50,127 --> 00:39:51,428
He gonna help me
get outta this mess.

733
00:39:51,528 --> 00:39:53,597
But what about Carmine
and the money you owe him?

734
00:39:53,697 --> 00:39:54,831
Don't worry about that
'cause he's lyin'.

735
00:39:54,931 --> 00:39:57,434
I do not owe him no $25,000!

736
00:39:57,534 --> 00:40:00,604
I owe him $7,000.
He added on interest.

737
00:40:00,704 --> 00:40:02,005
I don't even know why I asked.

738
00:40:02,105 --> 00:40:04,208
I'm sorry. Calm down.

739
00:40:04,308 --> 00:40:05,909
Don't worry about it.

740
00:40:06,009 --> 00:40:08,879
-How you doin'?
-I'm OK.

741
00:40:08,979 --> 00:40:10,047
How the baby doin'?

742
00:40:10,147 --> 00:40:11,148
He fine.

743
00:40:11,248 --> 00:40:12,449
How my baby boy doin'?

744
00:40:12,549 --> 00:40:14,551
You ain't
worrying about nothin'.

745
00:40:14,651 --> 00:40:17,921
My baby come out with two toes,
I'm gonna kick your ass.

746
00:40:18,021 --> 00:40:19,423
You've had the sonogram?

747
00:40:19,523 --> 00:40:20,591
-What?
-What?

748
00:40:20,691 --> 00:40:23,126
Sonogram? Did a three-part
exposé a few years back...

749
00:40:23,226 --> 00:40:24,228
on pre-natal health care.

750
00:40:24,328 --> 00:40:26,430
We discovered that not only--

751
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:27,898
Police. Open the door.

752
00:40:27,998 --> 00:40:30,100
We know you're in there.

753
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,401
In a minute!

754
00:40:31,501 --> 00:40:34,304
I don't know what else to say.

755
00:40:34,404 --> 00:40:35,839
Gimme your pager number.

756
00:40:35,939 --> 00:40:37,031
What for?

757
00:40:38,375 --> 00:40:40,611
Open this fucking door,
or we're gonna break it in!

758
00:40:40,711 --> 00:40:42,312
Anything go wrong, you page me.

759
00:40:42,412 --> 00:40:44,848
You can reach me there.
Everything gonna be all right.

760
00:40:44,948 --> 00:40:46,279
I'll take care of him.

761
00:40:50,454 --> 00:40:51,788
-Police!
-Wait a minute!

762
00:40:51,888 --> 00:40:54,224
Do you have a warrant?
What do you want?

763
00:40:54,324 --> 00:40:55,492
We want your boyfriend.

764
00:40:55,592 --> 00:40:57,160
Window!

765
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:58,662
You can't keep busting--

766
00:40:58,762 --> 00:40:59,751
Shut up!

767
00:41:05,102 --> 00:41:06,967
Wait for me!

768
00:41:16,747 --> 00:41:17,907
Come on!

769
00:41:33,296 --> 00:41:35,499
What the hell
are you shooting at?

770
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:37,801
He's a cop killer!

771
00:41:37,901 --> 00:41:39,569
Don't be
trying to kill everybody.

772
00:41:39,669 --> 00:41:41,899
For Christ's sake!

773
00:41:44,574 --> 00:41:46,343
Right here. This is it.

774
00:41:46,443 --> 00:41:47,603
Turn here.

775
00:41:51,882 --> 00:41:54,084
All you've been doing
is bitchin'...

776
00:41:54,184 --> 00:41:55,952
ever since we got together.

777
00:41:56,052 --> 00:41:58,455
So I'm bitching.
I'm not used to getting shot at.

778
00:41:58,555 --> 00:42:01,425
I'm not used to people getting
me into shit, so shut up.

779
00:42:01,525 --> 00:42:03,360
That French dude
who killed those cops...

780
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:05,429
had a stamp on his hand
from this club.

781
00:42:05,529 --> 00:42:06,963
A lot of Euro-trash
hang out here.

782
00:42:07,063 --> 00:42:08,231
We're gonna go in here.

783
00:42:08,331 --> 00:42:10,300
If we see him,
we're gonna call the cops...

784
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,391
get him busted,
and clear my name tonight.

785
00:42:15,539 --> 00:42:16,904
Can I handle this?

786
00:42:24,147 --> 00:42:26,450
Good evening.
James Russell, Channel 12 News.

787
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:28,452
We're doing
a report on local nightclubs.

788
00:42:28,552 --> 00:42:29,653
I'd like to ask you
a few questions.

789
00:42:29,753 --> 00:42:32,722
Oh, you're
the investigative reporter.

790
00:42:35,625 --> 00:42:36,526
Yes, I am.

791
00:42:36,626 --> 00:42:39,959
Get the fuck out of here.

792
00:42:48,371 --> 00:42:50,066
You got
a lot of pull in this town.

793
00:42:51,541 --> 00:42:53,276
I could do a report
on this shithole...

794
00:42:53,376 --> 00:42:54,502
that'd close it down forever.

795
00:42:55,679 --> 00:42:56,880
Fuck that.

796
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:58,315
If we can't go
to the Red Camel...

797
00:42:58,415 --> 00:42:59,416
Red Camel comes to us.

798
00:42:59,516 --> 00:43:00,717
What are you talking about?

799
00:43:00,817 --> 00:43:01,909
Just come on.

800
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:06,456
-Where are you going?
-Shut the hell up.

801
00:43:06,556 --> 00:43:08,114
Bring your ass on.

802
00:43:10,627 --> 00:43:11,889
Gimme a quarter.

803
00:43:13,296 --> 00:43:14,854
Hurry up and gimme a quarter!

804
00:43:25,008 --> 00:43:26,339
Who are you calling?

805
00:43:29,279 --> 00:43:32,549
It's Mike Vermishki.
Remember me?

806
00:43:32,649 --> 00:43:34,317
You done fucked with me
for the last time!

807
00:43:34,417 --> 00:43:36,186
There's a bomb in the building!

808
00:43:36,286 --> 00:43:38,811
That's right!
A goddamn bomb in the building!

809
00:43:40,423 --> 00:43:41,992
Get your ass out...

810
00:43:42,092 --> 00:43:43,252
Fuck you!

811
00:43:46,162 --> 00:43:48,932
There's a bomb in the building,
and it's fixin' to blow!

812
00:43:49,032 --> 00:43:52,035
You better get your ass out
right now!

813
00:43:52,135 --> 00:43:53,966
You have crossed the fucking--

814
00:43:55,972 --> 00:43:56,961
Watch this.

815
00:43:58,808 --> 00:44:01,912
Five, four, three...

816
00:44:02,012 --> 00:44:03,741
two, one.

817
00:44:06,349 --> 00:44:07,680
Move it!

818
00:44:08,585 --> 00:44:09,643
Voilà.

819
00:44:16,326 --> 00:44:18,462
That's him right there.
That's one right there.

820
00:44:18,562 --> 00:44:20,496
-You sure?
-I'm sure!

821
00:44:22,132 --> 00:44:23,497
That bitch fine.

822
00:44:24,634 --> 00:44:25,726
Wait a minute.

823
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,870
Let's go.

824
00:44:51,328 --> 00:44:52,795
This is crazy.

825
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:31,791
What the hell is--

826
00:47:25,482 --> 00:47:28,518
When we get in here,
you don't say nothin'.

827
00:47:28,618 --> 00:47:30,387
Only two white people
walked in here.

828
00:47:30,487 --> 00:47:32,522
Keep your mouth shut, you'll
be the first one to walk out.

829
00:47:32,622 --> 00:47:36,192
And another thing.
You ain't white, you mixed.

830
00:47:36,292 --> 00:47:39,227
Your mama black and your daddy
Puerto Rican if they ask you.

831
00:47:49,405 --> 00:47:50,473
What?

832
00:47:50,573 --> 00:47:52,942
Aaron here?
Franklin want to talk to him.

833
00:47:53,042 --> 00:47:55,612
Aaron don't know
no damn Franklin.

834
00:47:55,712 --> 00:47:57,113
How the hell you know?

835
00:47:57,213 --> 00:47:59,949
Tell him I was there when he
shot Baby Bro at MacArthur Park.

836
00:48:00,049 --> 00:48:01,384
Where'd he shoot Baby Bro?

837
00:48:01,484 --> 00:48:03,219
At MacArthur Park,
you big dumb--

838
00:48:03,319 --> 00:48:04,621
Where'd he shoot him?

839
00:48:04,721 --> 00:48:07,451
In the ass! Everybody know
he got shot in the ass!

840
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:11,795
Don't ever play me like that,
player-hater.

841
00:48:11,895 --> 00:48:13,697
I'm sorry.
I was just playin'.

842
00:48:13,797 --> 00:48:15,287
Black bastard.

843
00:48:19,769 --> 00:48:21,634
What's happening?

844
00:48:25,809 --> 00:48:27,110
What's up?

845
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:30,013
I tried calling you,
couldn't get through.

846
00:48:30,113 --> 00:48:31,481
But anyway, I need your help.

847
00:48:31,581 --> 00:48:33,149
I need some gats on credit.

848
00:48:33,249 --> 00:48:34,584
Again?

849
00:48:34,684 --> 00:48:37,353
Again? Last time,
you know that wasn't my mistake.

850
00:48:37,453 --> 00:48:38,688
That was Little Johnny
who fucked up the money.

851
00:48:38,788 --> 00:48:42,992
You know Little Johnny
is lnvisible Johnny now, right?

852
00:48:43,092 --> 00:48:45,929
I went to the funeral.
That was fucked up what you did.

853
00:48:46,029 --> 00:48:47,430
It was a closed casket
and everything.

854
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:48,724
But I appreciate this
if you do this.

855
00:48:51,301 --> 00:48:53,369
You get me two courtside...

856
00:48:53,469 --> 00:48:55,371
if it goes seven games,
on the floor...

857
00:48:55,471 --> 00:48:57,006
and I don't mean
behind the backboard.

858
00:48:57,106 --> 00:48:59,476
I gave you the wrong tickets
by mistake.

859
00:48:59,576 --> 00:49:02,312
It's done.
If it goes 700 games, I got you.

860
00:49:02,412 --> 00:49:03,902
Done.

861
00:49:05,715 --> 00:49:07,117
What the fuck is this shit?

862
00:49:07,217 --> 00:49:10,386
He's cool. He's just
a reporter from Channel 5 News.

863
00:49:10,486 --> 00:49:11,475
Reporter?

864
00:49:13,122 --> 00:49:14,357
What the hell--

865
00:49:14,457 --> 00:49:15,925
What's he reporting on,
my lifestyle?

866
00:49:16,025 --> 00:49:17,360
He gonna help me out!

867
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:19,596
Help you do what?

868
00:49:19,696 --> 00:49:21,064
Help me to clear my name!

869
00:49:21,164 --> 00:49:22,565
You fuck me up here...

870
00:49:22,665 --> 00:49:24,033
the only thing your name
is gonna be good for...

871
00:49:24,133 --> 00:49:25,468
is a goddamn tombstone.

872
00:49:25,568 --> 00:49:27,470
He don't know nothin'
about you. He here for me.

873
00:49:27,570 --> 00:49:29,731
He don't know nothin' about
the hos, guns, and drugs.

874
00:49:30,773 --> 00:49:32,308
I won't bring no shit
down on you.

875
00:49:32,408 --> 00:49:35,178
Look at me now.
How far we go back?

876
00:49:35,278 --> 00:49:36,880
Elementary?

877
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:38,572
Jump rope?

878
00:49:39,649 --> 00:49:41,014
Hide-and-go-seek?

879
00:49:42,085 --> 00:49:43,074
Pitty-pat?

880
00:49:44,621 --> 00:49:45,883
Red light, green light?

881
00:49:47,891 --> 00:49:51,494
What would our mamas say
see us like this?

882
00:49:51,594 --> 00:49:53,997
All the stuff we been through?

883
00:49:54,097 --> 00:49:55,655
We boys.

884
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:58,831
Cool?

885
00:50:03,006 --> 00:50:04,371
Come with me.

886
00:50:14,117 --> 00:50:15,846
So you say you got problems?

887
00:50:19,289 --> 00:50:21,621
Itty-bitty,
teeny-weeny problems.

888
00:50:22,959 --> 00:50:25,291
Big fat-ass problems.

889
00:50:27,463 --> 00:50:29,124
I got what you need.

890
00:50:30,466 --> 00:50:33,436
There's no itch that an...

891
00:50:33,536 --> 00:50:36,972
HK-MP5 can't scratch.

892
00:50:37,974 --> 00:50:40,877
Unless you want a...

893
00:50:40,977 --> 00:50:45,715
Uzi
with a Wilson suppresser on it.

894
00:50:45,815 --> 00:50:47,383
Very nice.

895
00:50:47,483 --> 00:50:48,885
Very...

896
00:50:48,985 --> 00:50:50,887
urban.

897
00:50:50,987 --> 00:50:53,590
I'd go with the Heckler & Koch.

898
00:50:53,690 --> 00:50:55,758
It's got a closed bolt,
as opposed to the Uzi.

899
00:50:55,858 --> 00:51:00,396
It's got a faster cyclic rate,
better sights, rear aperture.

900
00:51:00,496 --> 00:51:02,365
It's German,
as opposed to lsraeli.

901
00:51:02,465 --> 00:51:04,033
It's much more accurate than--

902
00:51:04,133 --> 00:51:05,760
Look, Dan Rather.

903
00:51:07,103 --> 00:51:08,938
You sure you not a cop?

904
00:51:09,038 --> 00:51:10,840
I'm sure I'm not a cop.

905
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:14,210
I did a report last year
on street weapons.

906
00:51:14,310 --> 00:51:16,212
If you don't shut up, the last
report you're gonna hear...

907
00:51:16,312 --> 00:51:18,948
is this Uzi
going off in your ass.

908
00:51:19,048 --> 00:51:21,417
I don't mean
to disrespect your shit...

909
00:51:21,517 --> 00:51:24,354
but this is too heavy.

910
00:51:24,454 --> 00:51:25,855
I need something lighter...

911
00:51:25,955 --> 00:51:27,857
'cause we're gonna be doing
a lot of running.

912
00:51:27,957 --> 00:51:29,826
See this here?
One or two of these.

913
00:51:29,926 --> 00:51:31,361
This is all I need.

914
00:51:31,461 --> 00:51:33,029
Couple of these, and I'm cool.

915
00:51:33,129 --> 00:51:34,596
I'll pay you back.
I'm good for it.

916
00:51:36,065 --> 00:51:37,166
What?

917
00:51:37,266 --> 00:51:39,903
Call me if you get in trouble.

918
00:51:40,003 --> 00:51:41,871
I'm gonna call you.
And thank you again.

919
00:51:41,971 --> 00:51:43,768
I'm gonna get you
that money soon.

920
00:51:53,249 --> 00:51:55,251
I just got
the lnterpol report back...

921
00:51:55,351 --> 00:51:57,387
on the John Doe they picked up
at the airport yesterday.

922
00:51:57,487 --> 00:51:59,389
This is our guy.
Raymond Villard.

923
00:51:59,489 --> 00:52:00,890
Last known residence: Belgium.

924
00:52:00,990 --> 00:52:02,825
He's wanted for killing a cop
in Paris...

925
00:52:02,925 --> 00:52:04,827
convicted of a jewelry heist
in London...

926
00:52:04,927 --> 00:52:06,896
wanted for killing someone else
in Cologne.

927
00:52:06,996 --> 00:52:08,331
It goes on and on.

928
00:52:08,431 --> 00:52:09,799
I don't think so.

929
00:52:09,899 --> 00:52:12,735
This guy could turn up laying
flat on his face in that bus.

930
00:52:12,835 --> 00:52:15,004
Forensics ain't done
with the bodies yet.

931
00:52:15,104 --> 00:52:17,040
I still think Hatchett's
our man.

932
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:18,341
Not according to this.

933
00:52:18,441 --> 00:52:20,076
Got a nice videotape
of your suspect here.

934
00:52:20,176 --> 00:52:22,111
It's from the security camera
in the deli.

935
00:52:22,211 --> 00:52:24,202
We'll see.

936
00:52:27,450 --> 00:52:29,352
And now a live report
from the scene.

937
00:52:29,452 --> 00:52:30,853
A cold-blooded murder...

938
00:52:30,953 --> 00:52:32,855
Iast night in a deli
here in downtown L.A.

939
00:52:32,955 --> 00:52:35,358
Homicide detectives have
identified the two gunmen...

940
00:52:35,458 --> 00:52:37,860
through the use
of a surveillance camera tape.

941
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:40,363
We're told they are
Franklin Maurice Hatchett...

942
00:52:40,463 --> 00:52:43,866
and an unnamed reporter
from Channel 12 News.

943
00:52:43,966 --> 00:52:45,368
Hatchett is already wanted...

944
00:52:45,468 --> 00:52:48,204
in connection with the death of
14 inmates and 2 policemen...

945
00:52:48,304 --> 00:52:50,707
during
a daring prison escape at--

946
00:52:50,807 --> 00:52:52,375
I have this late word just in.

947
00:52:52,475 --> 00:52:55,478
Police have released the name
of the second suspect...

948
00:52:55,578 --> 00:52:58,047
and he is James Russell
of Channel 12 News.

949
00:52:58,147 --> 00:53:00,850
We'll continue to update you
on this breaking story...

950
00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:02,051
as developments warrant.

951
00:53:02,151 --> 00:53:03,516
Now back to you in the studio.

952
00:53:05,521 --> 00:53:08,825
The eensy-weensy spider...

953
00:53:08,925 --> 00:53:12,495
walked up the waterspout.

954
00:53:12,595 --> 00:53:15,331
Down came the rain...

955
00:53:15,431 --> 00:53:16,566
And washed--

956
00:53:16,666 --> 00:53:18,468
How you doing?

957
00:53:18,568 --> 00:53:21,270
-Morning, folks.
-Have something to eat.

958
00:53:21,370 --> 00:53:22,839
I gotta talk to Grace.

959
00:53:22,939 --> 00:53:24,340
I'll take a little something.

960
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:26,342
I'm a little hungry.

961
00:53:26,442 --> 00:53:29,345
I was wondering when you was
gonna ask me to sit down.

962
00:53:29,445 --> 00:53:32,348
I think we're interrupting
a very tender breakfast here.

963
00:53:32,448 --> 00:53:33,783
That's cool. Is it cool?

964
00:53:33,883 --> 00:53:35,852
The kids say it's cool.

965
00:53:35,952 --> 00:53:38,187
Go take care
of your business with Grace.

966
00:53:38,287 --> 00:53:39,655
Talk to Grace
as long as you want.

967
00:53:39,755 --> 00:53:41,416
I'm gonna come and get you
when I'm through.

968
00:53:44,994 --> 00:53:46,829
I love it, man.
Nervous about the wedding.

969
00:53:46,929 --> 00:53:48,865
Best friend in the world.

970
00:53:48,965 --> 00:53:51,100
Did you tell Vic
I want him to call me?

971
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,869
He said
he was gonna call you soon.

972

-Thanks, Ma.

983
00:54:23,666 --> 00:54:25,964
That's how the rich stay rich.

984
00:54:27,537 --> 00:54:29,630
So how's the mistress
of the house this morning?

985
00:54:31,941 --> 00:54:34,977
I've never been
anybody's mistress.

986
00:54:35,077 --> 00:54:38,915
He was my first, my last,
my everything.

987
00:54:39,015 --> 00:54:40,607
Baby.

988
00:54:43,452 --> 00:54:44,942
Excuse me.

989
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,528
You pissed her off.

990
00:54:52,628 --> 00:54:53,788
She always like that?

991
00:54:54,997 --> 00:54:56,624
But she's worth it.

992
00:54:58,201 --> 00:55:00,369
What's going on? Oh, shit!

993
00:55:00,469 --> 00:55:01,537
What's in the paper?

994
00:55:01,637 --> 00:55:03,832
Nothing.

995
00:55:07,310 --> 00:55:09,210
So what'd you get the newlyweds

1002
00:55:29,432 --> 00:55:30,833
You gonna loan it to me?

1003
00:55:30,933 --> 00:55:32,335
I was just playing.

1004
00:55:32,435 --> 00:55:34,337
How many people sleep
in this bed?

1005
00:55:34,437 --> 00:55:37,840
Me and Connie. That's it.

1006
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:38,808
This is incredible.

1007
00:55:38,908 --> 00:55:40,810
Let me spend the night.

1008
00:55:40,910 --> 00:55:42,845

00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:45,769
This is it.

1011
00:55:52,622 --> 00:55:55,525
That's nice. That's tight.

1012
00:55:55,625 --> 00:55:57,693
That's nice, but...

1013
00:55:57,793 --> 00:55:59,283
What?

1014
00:56:00,763 --> 00:56:02,798
-What's the matter?
-Nothing. That's cool.

1015
00:56:02,898 --> 00:56:04,033
That's all right.

1016
00:56:04,133 --> 00:56:05,668
You hooking them up
on some Liberace-type shit.

1017
00:56:05,768 --> 00:56:07,170
What's wrong with it?

1018
00:56:07,270 --> 00:56:08,671
That's Bulgari.

1019
00:56:08,771 --> 00:56:09,897
Forget about it. It's cool.

1020
00:56:12,408 --> 00:56:13,898
They're not gonna like it?

1021
00:56:15,244 --> 00:56:17,146
You know something.

1022
00:56:17,246 --> 00:56:19,048
Did they say something to you?

1023
00:56:19,148 --> 00:56:20,816
Forget about it.
I can't be saying nothing.

1024
00:56:20,916 --> 00:56:22,351
I'm not in the family like that.

1025
00:56:22,451 --> 00:56:24,442
Be a friend. Tell me.

1026
00:56:27,256 --> 00:56:29,058
If I tell you this,
you can't them I told you.

1027
00:56:29,158 --> 00:56:30,785
Why would I do that?

1028
00:56:33,629 --> 00:56:36,098
I happen to know that
the newlyweds want a dope ride.

1029
00:56:36,198 --> 00:56:38,689
We don't do dope
in this family.

1030
00:56:39,835 --> 00:56:41,504
Not dope. A ride.

1031
00:56:41,604 --> 00:56:44,173
My chauffeur
will take them anywhere.

1032
00:56:44,273 --> 00:56:46,242
Not a ride. I mean a car.

1033
00:56:46,342 --> 00:56:48,511
Oh, a car.

1034
00:56:48,611 --> 00:56:50,346
I got a lot of cars.
Which one did they want?

1035
00:56:50,446 --> 00:56:51,814
They want the Bentley?
The Rolls?

1036
00:56:51,914 --> 00:56:53,849
Not any type of car.

1037
00:56:53,949 --> 00:56:56,315
They want a European type-X
racer car.

1038
00:56:57,987 --> 00:57:00,056
Where am I gonna get that
by tomorrow morning?

1039
00:57:00,156 --> 00:57:03,859
I think we can get one.
I know a place.

1040
00:57:03,959 --> 00:57:05,995
I'll take these back.

1041
00:57:06,095 --> 00:57:08,898
Why don't you let me keep them?
I'll give them back to you.

1042
00:57:08,998 --> 00:57:11,767
I'm just playing, unless
you're gonna let me keep it.

1043
00:57:11,867 --> 00:57:13,803
You brought a killer
into my parents' house!

1044
00:57:13,903 --> 00:57:15,304
Are you even listening to me?

1045
00:57:15,404 --> 00:57:17,306
Franklin may be
a lot of things...

1046
00:57:17,406 --> 00:57:18,808
but he is not a killer.

1047
00:57:18,908 --> 00:57:20,776
-Trust me on this one.
-I am trying.

1048
00:57:20,876 --> 00:57:22,645
We're supposed to be
in this together.

1049
00:57:22,745 --> 00:57:23,813
We are.

1050
00:57:23,913 --> 00:57:25,815
-What about tomorrow?
-I'll be here.

1051
00:57:25,915 --> 00:57:27,316
You are wanted for murder.

1052
00:57:27,416 --> 00:57:29,407
We can't get married
when you're wanted for murder.

1053
00:57:30,386 --> 00:57:31,546
You're right.

1054
00:57:34,357 --> 00:57:36,848
I'm telling you, we're gonna
have fun at the Auto Expo.

1055
00:57:37,727 --> 00:57:39,319
Oh, fuck me.

at this mechanical masterpiece.

1131
01:00:10,446 --> 01:00:11,580
Do I hear 140?

1132
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:16,152
The gentleman
who's welcoming all challengers.

1133
01:00:16,252 --> 01:00:17,653
Do I hear 145?

1134

One hundred and forty five

1135
01:00:19,722 --> 01:00:21,757
Suck my dick.

1136
01:00:21,857 --> 01:00:23,058
I believe that's 150.

1137
01:00:23,158 --> 01:00:24,560
What are you doing?

1138
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:25,594
Stop it.

1139
01:00:25,694 --> 01:00:27,096
Do I hear 155?

1140
01:00:27,196 --> 01:00:29,221
Still bidding strong now.

1141
01:00:30,199 --> 01:00:32,101

One hundred and sixty
is bid in time to my left now.

1143
01:00:33,536 --> 01:00:34,437
Who is this guy?

1144
01:00:34,537 --> 01:00:36,505
I don't know.
I gotta use the bathroom.

1145
01:00:36,605 --> 01:00:37,740
I'll be right back.

1146
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:39,137
We're in the middle of--

1147
01:00:40,075 --> 01:00:43,679
Who'll go 165,000?

1148
01:00:43,779 --> 01:00:45,047
Hello, police?

1149
01:00:45,147 --> 01:00:47,383
Y'all need to come out
to the auto auction right now.

1150
01:00:47,483 --> 01:00:48,851
The cop killer's down here.

1151
01:00:48,951 --> 01:00:51,887
They down here.
They shooting and shit.

1152
01:00:51,987 --> 01:00:53,289
Slapping people.
They acting a fool!

1153
01:00:53,389 --> 01:00:54,981
Cops wanna talk to you.
They on their way.

1154
01:00:57,092 --> 01:00:58,427
They wanna know
where to pick you up at.

1155
01:00:58,527 --> 01:00:59,495
You're dead.

1156
01:00:59,595 --> 01:01:02,431
The cops are on their way!
Hold up!

1157
01:01:02,531 --> 01:01:03,833
One of them dressed in black...

1158
01:01:03,933 --> 01:01:06,335
and the other one
dressed in a fucked-up tuxedo.

1159
01:01:06,435 --> 01:01:08,103
Hurry up!
People dying here!

1160
01:01:08,203 --> 01:01:11,036
One hundred and seventy five.
Still bidding strong.

1161
01:01:13,976 --> 01:01:16,345
Do I hear 180?

1162
01:01:16,445 --> 01:01:18,314
One hundred and eighty
is now the bid there.

1163
01:01:18,414 --> 01:01:19,938
One hundred and eighty five
thousand...

1164
01:01:20,950 --> 01:01:22,852
What the fuck is going on here?

1165
01:01:22,952 --> 01:01:24,854
What the hell
you doing down here?

1166
01:01:24,954 --> 01:01:28,858
You and I are gonna settle this
right here, right now.

1167
01:01:28,958 --> 01:01:32,194
Thanks to you,
I'm wanted for murder now, too.

1168
01:01:32,294 --> 01:01:33,696
I want some answers.

1169
01:01:33,796 --> 01:01:36,765
Me and Guy just down here
checking out some fly rides...

1170
01:01:36,865 --> 01:01:38,167
and macking some hos
and chillin'.

1171
01:01:38,267 --> 01:01:39,368
Imagine that.

1172
01:01:39,468 --> 01:01:41,871
Just like a "G" Dawg
on a fly tip...

1173
01:01:41,971 --> 01:01:44,807
flossin' with the posse,
cuttin' in the crib.

1174
01:01:44,907 --> 01:01:46,342
What the fuck does that mean?

1175
01:01:46,442 --> 01:01:47,877
I don't wanna have
to beat your ass...

1176
01:01:47,977 --> 01:01:49,444
but I will beat your ass!

1177
01:01:51,113 --> 01:01:52,848
Stay the fuck out of my face!

1178
01:01:52,948 --> 01:01:54,643
I'll be right back.

1179
01:01:57,186 --> 01:01:59,255
-You fucked up.
-You like that?

1180
01:01:59,355 --> 01:02:00,947
You done fucked up now!

1181
01:02:11,066 --> 01:02:12,167
Fucker.

1182
01:02:12,267 --> 01:02:13,666
Fuckin' with me?

1183
01:02:24,446 --> 01:02:27,438
Two hundred forty.
Do I hear 240,000?

1184
01:02:28,651 --> 01:02:30,915
Two hundred and forty thousand
bid there.

1185
01:02:33,389 --> 01:02:35,357
Two hundred and fifty thousand
if you wish, sir.

1186
01:02:37,426 --> 01:02:38,494
How you doing?

1187
01:02:38,594 --> 01:02:40,596
He won't give up.

1188
01:02:40,696 --> 01:02:42,364
Let's get out.

1189
01:02:42,464 --> 01:02:44,366
At 250,000, if you wish.

1190
01:02:44,466 --> 01:02:45,592
Fuck him.

1191
01:02:51,106 --> 01:02:53,442
Two hundred and fifty thousand
dollars!

1192
01:02:53,542 --> 01:02:56,636
Two hundred and fifty thousand
dollars is bid here.

1193
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:00,716
I believe
we've lost our competitor.

1194
01:03:00,816 --> 01:03:03,819
Two hundred and fifty
going once. Going twice.

1195
01:03:03,919 --> 01:03:06,188
Sold to the gentleman there.

1196
01:03:06,288 --> 01:03:07,482
Thank you very much.

1197
01:03:08,190 --> 01:03:09,817
You the man!

1198
01:03:12,795 --> 01:03:14,663
I'll meet you out front.

1199
01:03:14,763 --> 01:03:16,060
What?

1200
01:03:36,452 --> 01:03:38,215
Where you at?

1201
01:06:20,872 --> 01:06:22,032
Frenchy!

1202
01:06:31,216 --> 01:06:33,752
So this James is a murderer,
is that it?

1203
01:06:33,852 --> 01:06:36,021
No. James is innocent.

1204
01:06:36,121 --> 01:06:38,523
Is this other guy
Vic Damone's son, or isn't he?

1205
01:06:38,623 --> 01:06:39,758
I don't know.

1206
01:06:39,858 --> 01:06:41,627
So what are you telling me,
he's 100% moolie?

1207
01:06:41,727 --> 01:06:42,628
Who cares?

1208
01:06:42,728 --> 01:06:44,763
I had mom make him
a mozzarella omelet.

1209
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:46,865
That lying
son of a bitch bastard.

1210
01:06:46,965 --> 01:06:48,133
There's no wedding.

1211
01:06:48,233 --> 01:06:50,769
You're not gonna marry
this James.

1212
01:06:50,869 --> 01:06:52,704
But we've got 300 people
coming here tomorrow.

1213
01:06:52,804 --> 01:06:54,773
Good. They come here,
they eat, they drink...

1214
01:06:54,873 --> 01:06:55,907
they sing,
they go the fuck home!

1215
01:06:56,007 --> 01:06:57,776
And what am I supposed
to tell them?

1216
01:06:57,876 --> 01:06:59,778
You tell them that our Grace
was about to be married...

1217
01:06:59,878 --> 01:07:01,780
to some no-good,
limp-dick bastard!

1218
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:03,081
He is not limp-dicked.

1219
01:07:03,181 --> 01:07:04,983
I don't wanna hear that!

1220
01:07:05,083 --> 01:07:07,719
Please.
I love him, and I trust him.

1221
01:07:07,819 --> 01:07:09,221
Let's not jump to conclusions.

1222
01:07:09,321 --> 01:07:10,555
I'm gonna tell you something.

1223
01:07:10,655 --> 01:07:12,291
This James comes in here,
I break his legs.

1224
01:07:12,391 --> 01:07:14,693
And as far as Vic Damone Jr.--
That's not Vic Damone Jr.!

1225
01:07:14,793 --> 01:07:16,028
What the hell am I saying?

1226
01:07:16,128 --> 01:07:17,857
Have a drink.

1227
01:07:18,797 --> 01:07:19,957
Me, too.

1228
01:07:55,167 --> 01:07:56,868
You sure nobody followed you?

1229
01:07:56,968 --> 01:07:58,367
You sure?

1230
01:07:59,471 --> 01:08:00,995
Yes, nigger, I'm sure!

1231
01:08:03,308 --> 01:08:05,469
-Look under the table.
-What?

1232
01:08:08,413 --> 01:08:09,812
Look at that.

1233
01:08:11,249 --> 01:08:13,385
You done gone and done it now.

1234
01:08:13,485 --> 01:08:14,720
'Cause this scares me.

1235
01:08:14,820 --> 01:08:16,221
What you talking about?

1236
01:08:16,321 --> 01:08:18,223
This gonna take care of us
for the rest of our life.

1237
01:08:18,323 --> 01:08:19,791
We won't have to do shit else.

1238
01:08:19,891 --> 01:08:22,527
What we gonna do?
Where we gonna go?

1239
01:08:22,627 --> 01:08:26,231
We can go wherever the hell
we wanna go with this shit.

1240
01:08:26,331 --> 01:08:28,400
I was thinking about
buying a small country.

1241
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:30,469
This is wrong.

1242
01:08:30,569 --> 01:08:31,970
This is right!

1243
01:08:32,070 --> 01:08:34,239
It can't get no righter!

1244
01:08:34,339 --> 01:08:36,408
This is the only way
out of this shit I'm in.

1245
01:08:36,508 --> 01:08:38,210
Here's the number
for this policeman.

1246
01:08:38,310 --> 01:08:39,971
You want me to call the cops?

1247
01:08:41,713 --> 01:08:44,516
You want me to call them
so they can shoot me.

1248
01:08:44,616 --> 01:08:46,251
My baby ain't gonna be
no fugitive.

1249
01:08:46,351 --> 01:08:48,086
You don't wanna call the cops,
fine.

1250
01:08:48,186 --> 01:08:50,279
Maybe that reporter
can clear this whole thing up.

1251
01:08:54,860 --> 01:08:56,327
Fuck him.

1252
01:08:58,663 --> 01:09:02,064
And don't give me that look
'cause it ain't gonna work.

1253
01:09:03,668 --> 01:09:06,569
Don't even give me that look.
I see you looking at me.

1254
01:09:08,306 --> 01:09:10,297
One more time.

1255
01:09:11,309 --> 01:09:12,469
Think.

1256
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:16,939
Where are my diamonds?

1257
01:09:30,562 --> 01:09:31,824
Gimme a kiss.

1258
01:09:38,169 --> 01:09:39,271
Hey, James, that you?

1259
01:09:39,371 --> 01:09:43,608
I want the diamonds,
or your partner's dead.

1260
01:09:43,708 --> 01:09:45,210
Partner? I ain't got
no goddamn partner!

1261
01:09:45,310 --> 01:09:46,436
Who the fuck is this?

1262
01:09:47,512 --> 01:09:48,747
Listen to me.

1263
01:09:48,847 --> 01:09:50,582
I'm with some people
who've promised to kill me...

1264
01:09:50,682 --> 01:09:52,317
unless you give them
those diamonds...

1265
01:09:52,417 --> 01:09:54,252
the ones you forgot to mention!

1266
01:09:54,352 --> 01:09:55,420
What diamonds?

1267
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:57,789
The fucking diamonds,
you prick!

1268
01:09:57,889 --> 01:09:59,424
Medulla alagata.

1269
01:09:59,524 --> 01:10:00,725
What?

1270
01:10:00,825 --> 01:10:02,260
Tell them to shoot you
in the medulla alagata...

1271
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:04,596
right behind the ear.
You won't feel shit.

1272
01:10:04,696 --> 01:10:06,264
This isn't a joke.

1273
01:10:06,364 --> 01:10:08,229
I'm in some deep shit here.

1274
01:10:09,868 --> 01:10:11,269
Listen to me.

1275
01:10:11,369 --> 01:10:14,806
Three A.M.
Hangar number seven.

1276
01:10:14,906 --> 01:10:16,808
Long Beach airport.

1277
01:10:16,908 --> 01:10:19,811
Keep the diamonds
in the plastic bag.

1278
01:10:19,911 --> 01:10:20,946
They will be weighed.

1279
01:10:21,046 --> 01:10:22,080
Kiss my ass!

1280
01:10:22,180 --> 01:10:25,809
We meet where I say we meet,
French motherfucker.

1281
01:10:28,887 --> 01:10:30,377
What happened?

1282
01:10:31,890 --> 01:10:33,525
He hung up.

1283
01:10:33,625 --> 01:10:35,794
We meet on his turf,
then your ass be all alone.

1284
01:10:35,894 --> 01:10:38,797
Meet on my turf,
at least we got a chance.

1285
01:10:38,897 --> 01:10:40,387
He'll call back.

1286
01:10:42,901 --> 01:10:44,801
What'd I tell you?

1287
01:10:45,837 --> 01:10:47,272
All right, motherfucker,
this is the deal.

1288
01:10:47,372 --> 01:10:48,640
Watch your language!

1289
01:10:48,740 --> 01:10:51,309
Mama, I ain't know it you!

1290
01:10:51,409 --> 01:10:52,811
I ain't killed no cops.

1291
01:10:52,911 --> 01:10:54,312
Call me back.

1292
01:10:54,412 --> 01:10:56,314
Stop watching the news.

1293
01:10:56,414 --> 01:10:58,245
Don't be believing
everything on the news.

1294
01:11:03,355 --> 01:11:04,556
Who is this?

1295
01:11:04,656 --> 01:11:06,691
I'm listening.

1296
01:11:06,791 --> 01:11:08,760
This is the deal.

1297
01:11:08,860 --> 01:11:10,529
Fifty yard line,
Coliseum, three A.M.

1298
01:11:10,629 --> 01:11:12,230
And if Jimmy boy ain't alive...

1299
01:11:12,330 --> 01:11:13,854
you can kiss
them diamonds good-bye.

1300
01:11:14,866 --> 01:11:17,402
Tonight,
I'm gonna pay your ass off...

1301
01:11:17,502 --> 01:11:18,730
in diamonds.

1302
01:11:20,372 --> 01:11:22,774
Where's a piece of shit
like you get diamonds?

1303
01:11:22,874 --> 01:11:25,001
Coliseum, three A.M.

1304
01:11:28,179 --> 01:11:29,247
Williams.

1305
01:11:29,347 --> 01:11:30,507
Hey, cop.

1306
01:11:31,883 --> 01:11:33,285
This is Franklin Hatchett.

1307
01:11:33,385 --> 01:11:35,012
Meet me at the Coliseum,
three A.M.

1308
01:11:36,888 --> 01:11:37,789
Be there.

1309
01:11:37,889 --> 01:11:39,291
We'll be there.

1310
01:11:39,391 --> 01:11:42,294
That was Hatchett.
He wants to turn himself in.

1311
01:11:42,394 --> 01:11:43,795
I'm gonna go tell the captain.

1312
01:11:43,895 --> 01:11:45,297
No way, buddy.

1313
01:11:45,397 --> 01:11:47,299
This is our collar.
You and me. Us.

1314
01:11:47,399 --> 01:11:48,559
Let's go.

1315
01:12:01,413 --> 01:12:03,081
Roland, it's me.
Wake your old ass up.

1316
01:12:03,181 --> 01:12:04,115
What do you want?

1317
01:12:04,215 --> 01:12:05,917
I need you down at the booth
tonight.

1318
01:12:06,017 --> 01:12:07,644
I'm gonna owe you for this one.

1319
01:12:16,361 --> 01:12:17,862
Yo, Aaron?

1320
01:12:17,962 --> 01:12:19,264
Pick up the phone!

1321
01:12:19,364 --> 01:12:21,266
You said call you
if I need you.

1322
01:12:21,366 --> 01:12:22,767
I need you
at the Coliseum tonight.

1323
01:12:22,867 --> 01:12:24,528
Don't let a brother down.

1324
01:13:39,377 --> 01:13:41,546
Hatchett, drop the gun!

1325
01:13:41,646 --> 01:13:43,281
What the fuck y'all doing?

1326
01:13:43,381 --> 01:13:44,783
It's just for protection.

1327
01:13:44,883 --> 01:13:46,785
Don't you even scratch
your skinny, stanky ass...

1328
01:13:46,885 --> 01:13:48,520
or you're fucking dead.

1329
01:13:48,620 --> 01:13:50,021
Wait a minute!

1330
01:13:50,121 --> 01:13:51,756
I'm the motherfucker
who called y'all.

1331
01:13:51,856 --> 01:13:54,793
The dude you're looking
for is on his way.

1332
01:13:54,893 --> 01:13:56,294
Y'all just calm the fuck down.

1333
01:13:56,394 --> 01:13:58,296
Y'all gonna get medals
for this shit.

1334
01:13:58,396 --> 01:14:00,231
I'm helping y'all out.
Y'all trying to kill a nigger.

1335
01:14:00,331 --> 01:14:01,332
Hand over the gun!

1336
01:14:01,432 --> 01:14:03,068
I ain't handing over shit.

1337
01:14:03,168 --> 01:14:04,636
Hand over that gun right now.

1338
01:14:04,736 --> 01:14:06,304
How do I know y'all
ain't gonna shoot me?

1339
01:14:06,404 --> 01:14:08,139
I'm gonna shoot you
if you don't!

1340
01:14:08,239 --> 01:14:10,341
I'm gonna shoot, then!
We'll be dead motherfuckers!

1341
01:14:10,441 --> 01:14:12,432
-Hand over the gun!
-Shoot, then, shoot!

1342
01:14:14,879 --> 01:14:16,214
Shut the fuck up!

1343
01:14:16,314 --> 01:14:18,441
I ain't putting nothing down.

1344
01:14:20,318 --> 01:14:21,820
Nobody's gonna shoot you
if you hand me the gun.

1345
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:23,254
You gotta trust somebody.

1346
01:14:23,354 --> 01:14:24,255
I don't trust nobody.

1347
01:14:24,355 --> 01:14:25,757
Lower the gun.

1348
01:14:25,857 --> 01:14:27,258
You lower your gun.

1349
01:14:27,358 --> 01:14:28,560
Hand it over to me.

1350
01:14:28,660 --> 01:14:30,528
Nobody wants to die.

1351
01:14:30,628 --> 01:14:31,930
Come on, nice and easy.

1352
01:14:32,030 --> 01:14:33,765
Just hand me the gun.

1353
01:14:33,865 --> 01:14:35,767
If I give you the gun,
and he shoots me...

1354
01:14:35,867 --> 01:14:37,268
I'm gonna kick your ass.

1355
01:14:37,368 --> 01:14:39,063
He will not shoot you
if you give me the gun.

1356
01:14:41,272 --> 01:14:42,899
Control that white boy.

1357
01:14:45,210 --> 01:14:46,377
Backup's on the way...

1358
01:14:46,477 --> 01:14:49,310
and you're gonna tell me
where the diamonds are.

1359
01:14:51,216 --> 01:14:53,451
What are you talking about,
backup's on the way?

1360
01:14:53,551 --> 01:14:55,420
And whoever said something
about diamonds?

1361
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:57,112
Lieutenant, what the hell's
going on around here?

1362
01:15:06,564 --> 01:15:08,066
You son of a bitch.

1363
01:15:08,166 --> 01:15:10,368
You just killed my partner.

1364
01:15:10,468 --> 01:15:12,504
You just killed
your goddamn partner!

1365
01:15:12,604 --> 01:15:14,367
This is your gun.

1366
01:15:15,473 --> 01:15:17,031
Where are the diamonds?

1367
01:15:20,812 --> 01:15:23,406
You have my diamonds.

1368
01:15:50,975 --> 01:15:52,243
You three go that way.

1369
01:15:52,343 --> 01:15:53,711
You two go with Guido.

1370
01:15:53,811 --> 01:15:55,802
Find Franklin
and hold him for me.

1371
01:16:07,725 --> 01:16:09,594
Hey, Roland, wake up, man!

1372
01:16:09,694 --> 01:16:11,529
I know you're watching me!

1373
01:16:11,629 --> 01:16:12,864
These motherfuckers
are trying to kill me!

1374
01:16:12,964 --> 01:16:14,232
Wake the fuck up!

1375
01:16:14,332 --> 01:16:16,664
I need you right now!
Put me on the screen!

1376
01:16:20,672 --> 01:16:22,240
Bonjour, motherfucker.

1377
01:16:22,340 --> 01:16:24,375
Listen up. This is the deal.

1378
01:16:24,475 --> 01:16:26,477
Let my boy go, and
I'm gonna give you your shit.

1379
01:16:26,577 --> 01:16:28,046
So you can stop
fucking with me...

1380
01:16:28,146 --> 01:16:30,637
and take your old ass
back to France.

1381
01:16:32,951 --> 01:16:35,283
He does make a strong point.

1382
01:16:52,637 --> 01:16:53,626
Come on.

1383
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:04,082
Get up.

1384
01:17:04,182 --> 01:17:07,452
I got $15 million in diamonds.

1385
01:17:07,552 --> 01:17:09,921
Sounds to me like you
promised them to someone else.

1386
01:17:10,021 --> 01:17:11,890
I don't know
who the hell that is.

1387
01:17:11,990 --> 01:17:14,792
I know who it is,
but I didn't say...

1388
01:17:14,892 --> 01:17:17,629
we was the only people
that wanted the diamonds...

1389
01:17:17,729 --> 01:17:19,197
but I'm the only one
who know where they at.

1390
01:17:19,297 --> 01:17:20,999
I got a feeling
I put a bullet in your nuts...

1391
01:17:21,099 --> 01:17:22,867
you're gonna tell me
where they're at.

1392
01:17:22,967 --> 01:17:24,502
Stop playing.

1393
01:17:24,602 --> 01:17:26,104
You can't shoot
a nigger in his nuts.

1394
01:17:26,204 --> 01:17:27,228
I need my nuts.

1395
01:17:46,858 --> 01:17:49,160
If you kill me,
you won't find them diamonds.

1396
01:17:49,260 --> 01:17:51,596
You need me. Trust me.

1397
01:17:51,696 --> 01:17:52,897
Believe in me.

1398
01:17:52,997 --> 01:17:53,898
What about them?

1399
01:17:53,998 --> 01:17:55,900
Forget them.

1400
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,769
I figure for 10 million,
your boys will do their thing.

1401
01:17:57,869 --> 01:18:00,571
Ten million?
I thought it was 15 million.

1402
01:18:00,671 --> 01:18:03,041
What you think I'm doing
all this running around for?

1403
01:18:03,141 --> 01:18:04,275
I want some diamonds, too.

1404
01:18:04,375 --> 01:18:05,543
I ain't doing this shit
for free.

1405
01:18:05,643 --> 01:18:07,076
Look at your stingy ass.

1406
01:18:33,638 --> 01:18:37,199
The second we get those stones,
stick him.

1407
01:18:39,844 --> 01:18:40,833
Watch out!

1408
01:18:48,453 --> 01:18:49,943
One more step!

1409
01:18:52,490 --> 01:18:54,359
I was just going
to get diamonds.

1410
01:18:54,459 --> 01:18:55,756
Then get 'em for me now.

1411
01:19:15,346 --> 01:19:17,682
Fuse time, 20 seconds.

1412
01:19:17,782 --> 01:19:20,216
Or was it 10?

1413
01:19:41,973 --> 01:19:43,907
I'm ready for another close-up,
Mr. DeMille.

1414
01:19:47,445 --> 01:19:48,780
What the fuck's wrong with you?

1415
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:50,348
What you shootin' for?

1416
01:19:50,448 --> 01:19:53,017
I'm the only motherfucker that
know where the diamonds is...

1417
01:19:53,117 --> 01:19:54,719
so if you kill me,
you won't find 'em.

1418
01:19:54,819 --> 01:19:56,754
So tell your boys
to stop shooting...

1419
01:19:56,854 --> 01:19:58,219
or you ain't getting shit.

1420
01:21:25,743 --> 01:21:27,734
I want to report a shootout at--

1421
01:21:29,380 --> 01:21:30,779
I'll hold.

1422
01:21:47,164 --> 01:21:48,533
You're messing up everything.

1423
01:21:48,633 --> 01:21:50,328
Shut up and keep moving.

1424
01:21:54,005 --> 01:21:56,132
Who the fuck you shooting at?

1425
01:22:04,348 --> 01:22:06,441
I want those diamonds!

1426
01:22:16,227 --> 01:22:17,387
Come on!

1427
01:23:37,508 --> 01:23:41,312
First, I'm gonna shoot
your right knee.

1428
01:23:41,412 --> 01:23:44,615
Then I'm gonna shoot
the other one.

1429
01:23:44,715 --> 01:23:47,183
You got that, homey?

1430
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:52,112
Until you tell me
where my diamonds are.

1431
01:23:56,694 --> 01:23:58,252
That really must have hurt.

1432
01:24:02,700 --> 01:24:04,031
Kick his ass!

1433
01:24:08,906 --> 01:24:09,964
We gotta go.

1434
01:24:12,543 --> 01:24:15,876
Don't you ever say
I'm your goddamn homey!

1435
01:24:34,098 --> 01:24:35,099
OK, what?

1436
01:24:35,199 --> 01:24:37,301
OK, we done fucked up!

1437
01:24:37,401 --> 01:24:40,271
Listen.
I'm sorry I got you busted.

1438
01:24:40,371 --> 01:24:41,939
I want you to know,
for what it's worth...

1439
01:24:42,039 --> 01:24:44,842
I never doubted you.
Never once.

1440
01:24:44,942 --> 01:24:47,433
That ain't worth shit now
'cause we fixin' to die!

1441
01:24:48,312 --> 01:24:49,780
But thanks anyway.

1442
01:24:49,880 --> 01:24:51,279
You're welcome.

1443
01:24:53,818 --> 01:24:55,376
Hold this.

1444
01:25:23,514 --> 01:25:25,379
That was beautiful.

1445
01:25:27,084 --> 01:25:28,386
Follow me.

1446
01:25:28,486 --> 01:25:29,544
Let's go.

1447
01:25:40,764 --> 01:25:41,958
We almost there.

1448
01:26:07,258 --> 01:26:09,726
I get the feeling you stole from
the wrong bunch of bad guys.

1449
01:26:11,629 --> 01:26:15,766
You're right.
This shit ain't worth dying for.

1450
01:26:15,866 --> 01:26:17,163
I'm gonna give 'em
what they want.

1451
01:26:18,969 --> 01:26:20,231
Fuck this.

1452
01:26:32,716 --> 01:26:34,650
Sweet Jesus.

1453
01:26:40,024 --> 01:26:42,219
We surrender!

1454
01:26:43,294 --> 01:26:46,286
Stop, everybody!

1455
01:26:52,202 --> 01:26:53,430
We surrender!

1456
01:26:54,972 --> 01:26:56,337
We were just bullshitting.

1457
01:26:58,876 --> 01:27:00,400
I got your shit.

1458
01:27:01,512 --> 01:27:02,774
Is this what you want?

1459
01:27:13,157 --> 01:27:15,318
Come and get it!

1460
01:27:56,934 --> 01:27:58,458
Don't worry.

1461
01:27:59,803 --> 01:28:01,532
He won't get far.

1462
01:28:30,267 --> 01:28:31,969
And that's when
the L.A. Coliseum...

1463
01:28:32,069 --> 01:28:34,471
turned into a virtual war zone.

1464
01:28:34,571 --> 01:28:36,774
Among the dead,
Raymond Villard...

1465
01:28:36,874 --> 01:28:39,610
Ieader of a highly sophisticated
international smuggling ring...

1466
01:28:39,710 --> 01:28:42,746
and the man responsible
for Friday's prison break.

1467
01:28:42,846 --> 01:28:45,649
Also dead, LAPD detective
Bobby Pickett.

1468
01:28:45,749 --> 01:28:49,720
A dirty cop
who was Villard's inside man.

1469
01:28:49,820 --> 01:28:51,922
I have with me now
Franklin Hatchett...

1470
01:28:52,022 --> 01:28:53,791
the man once believed
to be responsible...

1471
01:28:53,891 --> 01:28:57,561
for the events and the chaos
that led to last night's mayhem.

1472
01:28:57,661 --> 01:28:59,129
Anything you'd like to add?

1473
01:28:59,229 --> 01:29:01,665
First of all,
I told y'all I was innocent.

1474
01:29:01,765 --> 01:29:03,133
For those y'all
that thought I was guilty...

1475
01:29:03,233 --> 01:29:04,401
y'all know what y'all can do.

1476
01:29:04,501 --> 01:29:05,603
Mama, I love you. I'm OK.

1477
01:29:05,703 --> 01:29:06,737
Paula, I love you, too.

1478
01:29:06,837 --> 01:29:07,972
I'm gonna be home later on.
We gonna party.

1479
01:29:08,072 --> 01:29:09,006
Cook some chicken
and some cornbread...

1480
01:29:09,106 --> 01:29:10,240
and some kool-aid...

1481
01:29:10,340 --> 01:29:12,376
and I'm gonna be back
at the car wash Monday morning.

1482
01:29:12,476 --> 01:29:14,912
Everything on sale,
half price. Peace out!

1483
01:29:15,012 --> 01:29:17,615
Thank you.

1484
01:29:17,715 --> 01:29:19,183
I'm James Russell.

1485
01:29:19,283 --> 01:29:21,683
This has been
a Channel 12 News exclusive.

1486
01:29:25,122 --> 01:29:27,391
If anyone can show just cause...

1487
01:29:27,491 --> 01:29:30,327
why this couple
should not be wed...

1488
01:29:30,427 --> 01:29:32,725
please speak now
or forever hold your peace.

1489
01:29:35,399 --> 01:29:36,866
The ring, please?

1490
01:29:45,309 --> 01:29:46,477
That's not the ring.

1491
01:29:46,577 --> 01:29:48,408
No shit.

1492
01:29:50,380 --> 01:29:52,049
Relax.

1493
01:29:52,149 --> 01:29:53,917
It's a wedding gift. Take it.

1494
01:29:54,017 --> 01:29:55,319
This is a sacred event.

1495
01:29:55,419 --> 01:29:57,444
I know it's sacred.
This is sacred, too.

1496
01:30:00,491 --> 01:30:02,059
Just take it. It's legal.

1497
01:30:02,159 --> 01:30:03,683
Don't nobody know about it.

1498
01:30:06,130 --> 01:30:07,698
How many did you keep?

1499
01:30:07,798 --> 01:30:08,699
Enough.

1500
01:30:08,799 --> 01:30:10,834
Now get married.

1501
01:30:10,934 --> 01:30:12,128
Take it.

1502
01:30:16,039 --> 01:30:17,708
Lord, forgive me.

1503
01:30:17,808 --> 01:30:19,366
He will.

1504
01:30:29,153 --> 01:30:30,984
You may now kiss the bride.

1505
01:30:31,984 --> 01:30:41,984
