1
00:00:42,485 --> 00:00:44,788
Daddy.

2
00:00:47,864 --> 00:00:50,102
Daddy, are you home?
Maybe he isn't.

3
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:52,376
Of course he is.
Daddy!

4
00:00:52,444 --> 00:00:55,064
Find him?

5
00:00:55,133 --> 00:00:59,391
Does it look like I found him,
Stanley? Well, I just thought...

6
00:01:04,387 --> 00:01:06,461
<i>Dad!</i>

7
00:01:07,846 --> 00:01:09,986
<i>Daddy.</i>

8
00:01:10,055 --> 00:01:14,400
<i>Don't worry about your father,
Barbara. I'm sure he's all right.</i>

9
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:16,330
Oh, I don't know.

10
00:01:18,061 --> 00:01:21,358
<i>Honey, I'm sure...
Daddy!</i>

11
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,783
Daddy, are you there?

12
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:27,437
We shouldn't have
left him alone.

13
00:01:27,507 --> 00:01:31,284
<i>He wanted to come here. Don't
get yourself all upset. Daddy!</i>

14
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:33,937
Honey. What...
Stanley!

15
00:01:34,008 --> 00:01:36,279
Okay, I'm coming. I'm coming! Daddy!

16
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,630
<i>I told you he should not be left alone.</i>

17
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,379
It's too big for one man in his
condition. He wanted to be left alone.

18
00:01:44,446 --> 00:01:47,547
You always take his side.
Daddy! Dad!

19
00:05:37,949 --> 00:05:39,411
Aaah!

20
00:06:22,779 --> 00:06:24,689
<i>Who are you? Your outfit? Where you going?</i>

21
00:06:24,764 --> 00:06:27,068
I don't know. You don't know? How come?

22
00:06:27,134 --> 00:06:29,983
I just moved up. Let me see your dog tags.

23
00:06:30,047 --> 00:06:31,936
Where are they?

24
00:06:32,001 --> 00:06:34,654
L... I can't find them.
He's a Kraut!

25
00:06:34,723 --> 00:06:36,546
He don't look like one.
I'm not! I'm an American.

26
00:06:36,613 --> 00:06:38,818
Prove it!
Prove it?

27
00:06:38,886 --> 00:06:41,309
Who plays third for the Tigers? The Tigers?

28
00:06:41,383 --> 00:06:44,419
<i>The Detroit Tigers.</i>

29
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:46,346
Who is it?
I don't know.

30
00:06:46,411 --> 00:06:48,267
Why ask him?
It came into my head.

31
00:06:48,332 --> 00:06:50,887
You guys go on without me.
Where's your weapon?

32
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:52,869
I don't have one.
Everybody's got one!

33
00:06:52,944 --> 00:06:56,459
I'm a chaplain. Assistant
chaplain. What's your name?

34
00:06:56,530 --> 00:07:00,307
Pilgrim. You know why
this got three sides on it?

35
00:07:00,373 --> 00:07:04,434
Makes a slit that don't
close up. Gee, that's great.

36
00:07:04,503 --> 00:07:07,375
A G.I. Knife makes a slit. Right.

37
00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:09,556
Slit closes up, right? Right.

38
00:07:09,627 --> 00:07:11,450
This makes
a three-sided slit.

39
00:07:11,516 --> 00:07:13,404
<i>It kills you.</i>

40
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:17,823
What's that?
Chaplain's assistant.

41
00:07:17,888 --> 00:07:20,443
No shit! What's your
name? His name's Pilgrim.

42
00:07:20,514 --> 00:07:22,850
You know how to pray?
Start praying!

43
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:27,197
Where are we, Corp? Belgium, stupid.

44
00:07:27,271 --> 00:07:30,754
You tell Paul Lazzaro where we
are! We're in the middle of Krauts!

45
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,681
You got us here.
Get us out!

46
00:07:32,746 --> 00:07:35,912
"Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

47
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:39,016
"Thy kingdom come. Thy will be
done on earth as it is in heaven.

48
00:07:39,087 --> 00:07:40,943
Give us this day our daily... "

49
00:07:41,008 --> 00:07:44,326
<i>Just beyond those trees
there's a farmhouse.</i>

50
00:07:44,402 --> 00:07:46,859
Go on without me.
I'll be all right.

51
00:07:46,932 --> 00:07:48,788
I'm gonna
scout that farmhouse.

52
00:07:48,853 --> 00:07:52,468
And if it's clear, I'll fire
my carbine three times spaced.

53
00:07:52,536 --> 00:07:54,392
Got it!

54
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:03,574
That son of a bitch
ditches us, I'll kill him.

55
00:08:03,647 --> 00:08:05,470
We could surrender.
What?

56
00:08:05,537 --> 00:08:08,124
We could surrender,
couldn't we?

57
00:08:08,194 --> 00:08:10,083
We'd just
have to stay here...

58
00:08:10,148 --> 00:08:13,795
Me and the corporal and the dago, we're
Americans! We don't surrender! Got that?

59
00:08:13,862 --> 00:08:16,384
He's took off.

60
00:08:29,072 --> 00:08:30,961
That corporal.

61
00:08:31,026 --> 00:08:34,159
He'll get back home
after the war.

62
00:08:34,227 --> 00:08:36,531
He'll be a big hero.

63
00:08:36,597 --> 00:08:39,446
Dames'll be climbin'
all over him.

64
00:08:39,512 --> 00:08:43,922
Couple of years go by, and one day
there's gonna be a knock on his door,

65
00:08:43,994 --> 00:08:46,844
and there'll be this stranger.

66
00:08:46,909 --> 00:08:50,970
"Paul Lazzaro sent me," the stranger
will say and shoot his pecker off.

67
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:55,385
<i>Stranger will give him a couple of seconds
to think about who Paul Lazzaro is...</i>

68
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:58,394
and what life's gonna be like
without a pecker,

69
00:08:58,468 --> 00:09:01,602
then he'll shoot him once
in the guts and walk away.

70
00:09:01,671 --> 00:09:03,461
Yes.

71
00:09:04,008 --> 00:09:07,687
<i>Billy, you time tripping again?</i>

72
00:09:07,754 --> 00:09:11,947
I can always tell, you know,
when you've been time tripping.

73
00:09:15,312 --> 00:09:17,834
You were back in the war,
weren't you?

74
00:09:19,634 --> 00:09:23,379
Time travel's a bitch for you,
isn't it? Particularly the war.

75
00:09:23,445 --> 00:09:26,579
I can't help it.

76
00:09:26,648 --> 00:09:31,702
Why don't we see if old Mother Montana
can't keep you stuck right here for awhile.

77
00:09:32,891 --> 00:09:36,691
How about a little kiss? A little kiss?

78
00:09:36,766 --> 00:09:38,458
- A little ki...
- A what?

79
00:09:38,528 --> 00:09:41,596
A little kiss.
- You fuckin' faggot!

80
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:44,034
What's the matter?
You fuckin' fairy!

81
00:09:47,365 --> 00:09:49,189
What's the matter, faggot?

82
00:09:49,254 --> 00:09:51,427
<i>I was thinkin' of a girl.
He wanted to kiss me.</i>

83
00:09:53,257 --> 00:09:55,648
I was imagining things
and I was...

84
00:09:58,701 --> 00:10:01,223
Krauts!

85
00:10:04,209 --> 00:10:07,342
<i>Stehen Sie auf.</i>

86
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:22,967
<i>Billy, you're wonderful.</i>

87
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:30,745
I'm so glad I waited.

88
00:10:30,818 --> 00:10:33,471
I'm glad
we waited too.

89
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:38,214
Otherwise, it wouldn't have seemed
the same tonight. No, it wouldn't.

90
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:42,593
It starts the whole marriage off
on the right foot.

91
00:10:42,667 --> 00:10:44,610
Yeah. Yeah.

92
00:10:46,766 --> 00:10:51,046
I know when you were in the war
you must have had experiences.

93
00:10:53,618 --> 00:10:57,549
Well... No, don't tell me
about them! It was wartime.

94
00:10:57,621 --> 00:11:01,933
Anyway, it's different for a man
than for a woman. I understand.

95
00:11:02,008 --> 00:11:03,919
Just so glad we waited.

96
00:11:03,993 --> 00:11:05,882
So am I.

97
00:11:09,437 --> 00:11:14,743
And you know what? I'm gonna
lose weight just for you, Billy.

98
00:11:14,816 --> 00:11:18,114
See.
Before I needed a reason,

99
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:21,410
and now...
I have one!

100
00:11:23,687 --> 00:11:29,058
Hey, Billy. I think we've
begun the life of a new hero.

101
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:36,261
How can you tell?
Because I'm a woman.

102
00:11:36,335 --> 00:11:38,726
Huh!

103
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:44,431
And you know what, Billy? What?

104
00:11:46,903 --> 00:11:50,680
I never thought
anybody would ever marry me.

105
00:11:52,282 --> 00:11:54,105
I did.

106
00:12:48,672 --> 00:12:51,095
Oh, Jesus!
Stay off my feet, will ya?

107
00:13:07,757 --> 00:13:11,534
Oh, walk right, will ya?
Gee, I'm sorry.

108
00:13:11,599 --> 00:13:16,207
You step on his feet again, you son
of a bitch, and I'll break your ass!

109
00:13:16,275 --> 00:13:18,927
<i>You hear me?</i>

110
00:13:18,996 --> 00:13:21,486
<i>Die blonde Haar.
Bringen Sie Marine.</i>

111
00:13:21,558 --> 00:13:24,560
<i>Over here.
Schnell!</i>

112
00:13:50,089 --> 00:13:53,288
Good. Hold it. Look out here
now. Can you get the sign in?

113
00:13:53,356 --> 00:13:55,627
The sign's in good. Okay, smile.

114
00:13:55,693 --> 00:13:58,761
<i>Looks good.
Hold it.</i>

115
00:13:58,831 --> 00:14:00,588
<i>Big smile now.
Big smile!</i>

116
00:14:00,657 --> 00:14:04,554
<i>Ja! Lacheln.
Lacheln. Lacheln. Ja.</i>

117
00:14:04,628 --> 00:14:08,787
<i>Hey, that's good.
Hold that kiss.</i>

118
00:14:08,854 --> 00:14:11,758
<i>We got it!</i>

119
00:14:19,421 --> 00:14:22,555
All you dog faces
from the 451 st over here.

120
00:14:22,624 --> 00:14:26,336
Fall in here. It's your old
colonel, boys. It's Wild Bob.

121
00:14:27,651 --> 00:14:29,889
<i>Four-fifty-first.</i>

122
00:14:29,957 --> 00:14:32,031
You from the 451 st?

123
00:14:32,102 --> 00:14:34,754
Some of you boys
must be from the 451 st.

124
00:14:34,823 --> 00:14:37,280
I know you, don't I?
What's your name?

125
00:14:37,353 --> 00:14:40,170
Pilgrim, sir. Pilgrim.
Of course! I remember you.

126
00:14:40,235 --> 00:14:42,604
Damn fine rifleman.
Fine rifleman, Pilgrim.

127
00:14:42,669 --> 00:14:44,775
One of the best
in the 451 st.

128
00:14:44,846 --> 00:14:47,663
First in peace,
first in war, and first...

129
00:14:49,938 --> 00:14:52,722
Get your hands off me! An
officer's place is with his men!

130
00:14:52,788 --> 00:14:57,013
My men need me, and I'm stayin' with
'em! Don't worry; it's your old colonel.

131
00:14:57,079 --> 00:14:59,535
Wild Bob is with you.
No formalities. At ease.

132
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:02,807
<i>By God, Wild Bob's
proud of you.</i>

133
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:06,139
There are dead Germans all over the
place wishin' to God they'd never...

134
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:14,746
I'm stayin' with my men.

135
00:15:14,819 --> 00:15:17,471
All right. All right.
God bless you, boys.

136
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,964
Bless you, boys.

137
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,783
By God, boy,
you're a good soldier.

138
00:15:23,849 --> 00:15:25,606
You'll come
through this all right.

139
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:28,873
And when you get to Cody,
Wyoming, just ask for Wild Bob.

140
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,244
We'll have one hell
of a reunion.

141
00:15:32,847 --> 00:15:37,553
God bless you, boys!
Bless ya, boys!

142
00:15:37,618 --> 00:15:41,876
A fag frolic in Wyoming. I'll be
there, Pilgrim, waitin' for you.

143
00:15:42,934 --> 00:15:44,757
Come on.

144
00:15:44,823 --> 00:15:50,261
This ain't so bad. I been in
a lot worse spots than this.

145
00:15:50,331 --> 00:15:52,667
Troy. Winter of'37.

146
00:15:52,732 --> 00:15:56,030
Cold?
I'll tell you!

147
00:15:56,095 --> 00:16:01,368
Or take the time Watkins and me decked
the yard bull at White River junction.

148
00:16:01,442 --> 00:16:04,827
Had us in the pen
for three weeks in our Skivvies.

149
00:16:04,901 --> 00:16:08,766
Would have had pneumonia
if we hadn't jumped the place.

150
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:12,999
<i>They took us up to Burlington
to check us out.</i>

151
00:16:13,066 --> 00:16:15,719
Last I heard, Joe
was somewheres on the Alagash.

152
00:16:15,788 --> 00:16:19,882
<i>You try that sometime, pal.</i>

153
00:16:19,951 --> 00:16:24,394
<i>You try that sometime
in February in 1934,</i>

154
00:16:24,466 --> 00:16:26,322
then see
if this is so bad.

155
00:16:26,387 --> 00:16:28,975
<i>There are plenty
of worse places.</i>

156
00:16:29,045 --> 00:16:30,901
Plenty of worse places.

157
00:16:33,977 --> 00:16:37,874
<i>He was at the top ofhis class
in optometry when this happened.</i>

158
00:16:37,947 --> 00:16:40,315
<i>I don't doubt it,
Mrs. Pilgrim.</i>

159
00:16:40,381 --> 00:16:42,771
<i>The doctor says
it's nervous exhaustion.</i>

160
00:16:42,846 --> 00:16:44,855
<i>Oh, I'm sure
that's all it is.</i>

161
00:16:44,928 --> 00:16:46,652
<i>I think it's the war.</i>

162
00:16:46,721 --> 00:16:49,571
That certainly could
have a lot to do with it.

163
00:16:49,635 --> 00:16:52,222
<i>But he had
some awful experiences.</i>

164
00:16:52,292 --> 00:16:54,661
<i>He was in Dresden
when it was bombed.</i>

165
00:16:54,726 --> 00:16:56,637
<i>His closest friend
was killed there.</i>

166
00:16:56,712 --> 00:16:59,201
<i>Oh, dreadful.
Dreadful.</i>

167
00:16:59,273 --> 00:17:02,439
And his father passed on
while Billy was in training.

168
00:17:02,507 --> 00:17:06,634
But I knew God would send
Billy home safe to me.

169
00:17:06,702 --> 00:17:09,574
<i>I prayed every night,
Mr. Rosewater.</i>

170
00:17:09,648 --> 00:17:12,170
<i>Even though we don't
belong to a church.</i>

171
00:17:12,242 --> 00:17:16,239
We're all
in God's hands, dear.

172
00:17:20,184 --> 00:17:23,252
Billy!
Billy, Mama's here.

173
00:17:23,322 --> 00:17:25,396
You can come out now.

174
00:17:28,157 --> 00:17:29,882
He's engaged
to a very rich girl.

175
00:17:29,951 --> 00:17:34,591
Her name's Valencia. Valencia
Merble. Her father's Lionel Merble.

176
00:17:34,658 --> 00:17:38,916
He owns the Ilium School of
Optometry where Billy was going.

177
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:43,326
He's building a brand-new home for
them on the lake for a wedding present.

178
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,085
<i>It's a surprise.</i>

179
00:17:46,153 --> 00:17:49,538
<i>Billy. Billy,
sweetheart.</i>

180
00:17:49,612 --> 00:17:52,461
The war is over.
You can come out now.

181
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:56,715
Pilgrim!
You killed me, Pilgrim.

182
00:17:57,617 --> 00:17:59,406
You son of a bitch.

183
00:17:59,475 --> 00:18:03,219
You call my mom and dad
in Pittsburgh, see.

184
00:18:03,285 --> 00:18:05,588
You tell them I died
and that you killed me!

185
00:18:11,899 --> 00:18:14,322
Weary.

186
00:18:16,318 --> 00:18:18,229
This is Paul Lazzaro, Weary.

187
00:18:18,303 --> 00:18:20,890
I'll get revenge for you.

188
00:18:20,961 --> 00:18:22,718
Lazzaro.
Yeah.

189
00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:32,996
Did I ever tell you what
happened to the dog? It's hot.

190
00:18:33,065 --> 00:18:36,416
Son of a bitch dog bit me.
So I got some steak,

191
00:18:36,492 --> 00:18:40,935
and I got this spring out of a clock, and
I cut that spring up into little pieces.

192
00:18:41,006 --> 00:18:45,614
I stuck it into the steak. Way inside. I
went to where they had that dog tied up.

193
00:18:45,682 --> 00:18:49,262
I said, "Hey, boy. I'm not mad.
Come on. Let's be friends. "

194
00:18:49,332 --> 00:18:53,164
And I threw him the steak, and I
waited around for around 10 minutes.

195
00:18:53,238 --> 00:18:57,944
And he started cryin', and the
blood spilled out of his mouth.

196
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:01,787
He tried to chew out
his own insides, and I said,

197
00:19:01,852 --> 00:19:04,188
"Hey, boy.

198
00:19:04,255 --> 00:19:08,316
That's me inside there
with those knives. "

199
00:19:08,385 --> 00:19:12,698
Anybody ask you
the sweetest thing in the world,

200
00:19:12,772 --> 00:19:14,628
it's revenge.

201
00:19:24,012 --> 00:19:26,534
Weary's dead, Pilgrim.

202
00:19:30,095 --> 00:19:32,585
The patient has been
suffering from trauma...

203
00:19:32,658 --> 00:19:35,562
which we think can be
treated by electric shock.

204
00:19:35,636 --> 00:19:37,492
Hello, Billy.
Hello.

205
00:19:37,557 --> 00:19:41,421
We've prescribed a series of 12,
and we're up to number seven.

206
00:19:41,495 --> 00:19:44,564
The patient was a prisoner of
war in Dresden when it was bombed.

207
00:19:44,634 --> 00:19:48,914
He claims that well over 100,000
people were burned to death in the fire.

208
00:19:48,989 --> 00:19:51,893
Worse than Hiroshima. And
since Billy was actually there,

209
00:19:51,967 --> 00:19:57,372
it's natural to assume that this has had a
contributing effect on his present condition.

210
00:19:57,443 --> 00:20:01,985
<i>He's ready, Doctor. You're
going to sleep now, Billy.</i>

211
00:21:09,907 --> 00:21:11,948
<i>Aufstiegen.</i>

212
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:14,292
<i>Was is los?
Arouse!</i>

213
00:21:14,358 --> 00:21:16,847
<i>Arouse!</i>

214
00:21:28,544 --> 00:21:30,367
<i>Schnell!</i>

215
00:22:47,701 --> 00:22:50,703
Name?
Paul Lazzaro.

216
00:22:50,775 --> 00:22:52,631
That's two z's.

217
00:22:52,696 --> 00:22:56,660
Parents? I don't got no
family. I said two z's.

218
00:22:56,732 --> 00:23:00,029
To whom we send the number in
case of death? Send it to him.

219
00:23:03,905 --> 00:23:06,557
This is your tag.
Don't forget it.

220
00:23:06,626 --> 00:23:09,246
<i>Ja, wohl.</i>

221
00:23:11,526 --> 00:23:13,414
<i>Name?</i>

222
00:23:13,478 --> 00:23:15,367
<i>Parents?</i>

223
00:23:15,432 --> 00:23:18,948
You want it now, Pilgrim? Or in
the morning? What do you want?

224
00:23:19,019 --> 00:23:21,639
<i>- Hey, hey! Why me?
- Aufstehen!</i>

225
00:23:21,709 --> 00:23:24,493
Oh, you're
on my list, pal.

226
00:23:24,558 --> 00:23:26,469
<i>- Aufstehen!
- Aufstehen.</i>

227
00:23:30,162 --> 00:23:33,939
Gear it down, fella. These
Germans can be awfully mean.

228
00:23:34,004 --> 00:23:36,494
Oh, yeah? Well, they don't know Paul Lazzaro.

229
00:23:36,567 --> 00:23:39,885
Listen. We Americans
have got to stick together.

230
00:23:39,961 --> 00:23:42,451
Who are you, pop?
I'm Edgar Derby.

231
00:23:42,523 --> 00:23:45,907
Yeah? Well, I got somethin'
for you to stick, Derby.

232
00:23:51,648 --> 00:23:55,360
All right. All right.

233
00:23:55,428 --> 00:23:59,227
Hey, you fuckin' goon! All
right. I'm takin' 'em off!

234
00:23:59,302 --> 00:24:03,363
Leave me alone! I'll take
'em off! I'm warnin' ya, pal.

235
00:24:06,795 --> 00:24:08,771
All right, son.
Over here.

236
00:24:16,498 --> 00:24:20,624
<i>Here we go, Billy boy. I'll take
you out. Time to sink or swim!</i>

237
00:24:20,692 --> 00:24:23,542
That's the way to do it,
Pilgrim. Best thing for him.

238
00:24:23,606 --> 00:24:26,608
By God, Pilgrim.
You're really gonna do it.

239
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:30,960
You bet your boots I'm gonna do it. His
mama's not gonna keep him all of his life.

240
00:24:31,035 --> 00:24:33,939
<i>My old man did the same to me.
Done me a world of good.</i>

241
00:24:34,013 --> 00:24:36,316
Oh, you betcha!
It's the only way!

242
00:24:36,383 --> 00:24:39,681
Well, this is it, Billy boy.
It's sink or swim!

243
00:24:39,745 --> 00:24:42,781
<i>And don't...</i>

244
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:48,805
<i>Billy?</i>

245
00:24:48,872 --> 00:24:50,728
<i>Billy?</i>

246
00:24:51,977 --> 00:24:53,833
<i>Billy!</i>

247
00:25:19,004 --> 00:25:21,821
Who are they?
They're Russian prisoners.

248
00:25:36,807 --> 00:25:40,225
# Hail, hail
the Yanks are here #

249
00:25:40,298 --> 00:25:43,878
<i>#Join the men from Dover

250
00:25:43,948 --> 00:25:47,726
#We bid you welcome here #

251
00:25:47,791 --> 00:25:52,267
<i># With a little food and cheer
you're welcome here #</i>

252
00:25:52,338 --> 00:25:55,471
#To share our food #

253
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:58,925
<i>#And cheer ##</i>

254
00:26:01,881 --> 00:26:03,890
Evening.
Come along inside.

255
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:05,970
We've organized
a little welcome.

256
00:26:06,043 --> 00:26:08,412
<i>We had a couple of days notice
of your arrival.</i>

257
00:26:08,477 --> 00:26:10,333
That gave us
an opportunity to prepare.

258
00:26:10,398 --> 00:26:13,783
Hear you had a pretty beastly time
in Bondem. Jerry put on quite a show.

259
00:26:13,857 --> 00:26:15,964
It can't last forever,
can it?

260
00:26:32,589 --> 00:26:36,683
- Where'd you get all this?
- Red Cross. Clerical error.

261
00:26:36,752 --> 00:26:39,656
They've been sending us 500
parcels a month instead of 50.

262
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:42,482
Three years now. We've
got rather a lot, actually.

263
00:26:42,548 --> 00:26:44,437
Shouldn't you tell 'em?

264
00:26:44,502 --> 00:26:46,194
Shouldn't you
give it back?

265
00:26:46,263 --> 00:26:50,968
Oh, Yank. You haven't been in
the fight very long, have you?

266
00:26:51,034 --> 00:26:54,746
Come along. I keep forgetting wars
have always been fought by children.

267
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:58,710
Where did you get this absurd
garment? They gave it to me.

268
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:00,672
Who?
The Germans.

269
00:27:00,737 --> 00:27:05,312
They didn't give you a coat, Yank, they
gave you an insult. Hey, son. Over here.

270
00:27:16,043 --> 00:27:17,954
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

271
00:27:18,029 --> 00:27:20,616
Jerry tried
to humiliate you.

272
00:27:20,686 --> 00:27:25,196
Now you must wear that coat as if you
were proud of it. Teach him a lesson.

273
00:27:26,675 --> 00:27:29,010
It's terribly important
that you understand that.

274
00:27:29,076 --> 00:27:32,656
It's been almost four years since I was
taken prisoner. True of most of us here.

275
00:27:32,726 --> 00:27:36,985
We haven't seen a woman or a child in all
of that time. Think about that for a minute.

276
00:27:38,651 --> 00:27:40,954
Want to know
how we survived?

277
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,876
Well, I'll tell you.

278
00:27:42,941 --> 00:27:44,885
The day that I was captured,

279
00:27:44,959 --> 00:27:46,815
I made a promise to myself:

280
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,500
I vowed each day I would
brush my teeth, shave my beard,

281
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:54,275
wash my hands and face before each
meal, evacuate my bowels with regularity.

282
00:27:54,341 --> 00:27:57,026
And do you know why?

283
00:27:58,535 --> 00:28:03,143
Because the war consists of
continual petty humiliations.

284
00:28:03,211 --> 00:28:06,956
And I for one was going to treat myself
with a good deal of self-respect and survive.

285
00:28:07,022 --> 00:28:09,195
Do you think
you can do it?

286
00:28:17,204 --> 00:28:20,949

00:29:18,334 --> 00:29:20,702
<i>Come on!
Come on, boy!</i>

302
00:29:20,767 --> 00:29:24,414
Come on. Jump in.
Come on. Jump!

303
00:29:24,481 --> 00:29:26,425
Attaboy!

304
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:30,114
Good dog, Spot.

305
00:29:30,182 --> 00:29:32,518
Good.

306
00:29:32,583 --> 00:29:34,821
Billy!

307
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:38,433
- Billy!
- Yeah?

308
00:29:38,507 --> 00:29:42,121
<i>- Supper time, hon.
- Be right in.</i>

309
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:45,356
<i>Spot, sit up.
#He looked for her uptown #</i>

310
00:29:45,424 --> 00:29:47,596
You think so?
Come on. Look at that!

311
00:29:47,666 --> 00:29:53,004
Now, roll over, Spot.
Atta, boy. Isn't he great?

312
00:29:53,077 --> 00:29:55,796
Where's daddy?
That's right.

313
00:29:55,863 --> 00:29:59,281
Where's mommy? Where's
mommy? Wh-Where's mommy?

314
00:29:59,354 --> 00:30:02,487
That's right.
Hi, Spot. Spot!

315
00:30:02,555 --> 00:30:07,610
<i>Oh, Billy! Get that goddamn mutt
out ofhere. Get him out ofhere. Out!</i>

316
00:30:09,504 --> 00:30:11,415
<i>Oh, poor Bobby.</i>

317
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:14,591
<i>I can't stand that animal! He's ruined
three carpets, two pairs of shoes...</i>

318
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,450
<i>He's driving me crazy.</i>

319
00:30:16,517 --> 00:30:23,362
<i>#For true love will come smiling through ##</i>

320
00:30:27,084 --> 00:30:30,283
You're okay, Spot.
You're okay.

321
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:35,147
You make a little mistake
now and then, but you're okay.

322
00:30:35,217 --> 00:30:37,106
You got heart.

323
00:30:40,149 --> 00:30:44,560
Yeah. Old Spot.

324
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:03,396
<i>Pilgrim.</i>

325
00:32:03,469 --> 00:32:06,406
<i>Pilgrim.</i>

326
00:32:06,479 --> 00:32:08,520
Pilgrim!

327
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,929
Can ya hear me, Pilgrim?

328
00:32:10,994 --> 00:32:13,101
Huh? Can ya
hear me, Pilgrim?

329
00:32:13,172 --> 00:32:15,759
When do you want it?
When do you want it?

330
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:18,767
You'll never know when it's gonna
happen. Maybe years. What's goin' on?

331
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,908
<i>- All right, son.
- This pork chop killed a friend.</i>

332
00:32:21,978 --> 00:32:23,801
- I didn't. I just...
- This man is sick.

333
00:32:23,868 --> 00:32:25,844
Yeah? Well, he's gonna be dead. Out.

334
00:32:25,917 --> 00:32:27,925
You wanna make the list?
Outside, Lazzarino.

335
00:32:27,998 --> 00:32:31,099
Lazzaro! L-
a- z... Out!

336
00:32:31,168 --> 00:32:34,945
You threaten this man again,
I'll break you in half.

337
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:43,780
<i>Don't ever answer the door.
You tell 'em what happens.</i>

338
00:32:43,848 --> 00:32:47,528
Nobody fucks around with
Paul Lazzaro. You tell 'em!

339
00:32:48,876 --> 00:32:51,628
Boy's all twisted up inside.

340
00:32:51,694 --> 00:32:53,583
Feelin' better?

341
00:32:53,648 --> 00:32:55,504
Yes, thank you.

342
00:32:55,569 --> 00:32:59,980
What's he got against you? He's got this
crazy idea I caused his friend's death.

343
00:33:00,052 --> 00:33:02,225
I didn't, I...
I'm sure you didn't.

344
00:33:03,254 --> 00:33:05,427
I'll talk some turkey
to that boy.

345
00:33:08,217 --> 00:33:11,765
- What happened to me?
- You passed out, and I brought you in here.

346
00:33:13,501 --> 00:33:16,951
Here. Try some of this.

347
00:33:17,023 --> 00:33:19,129
This will fix you up.

348
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,144
Kinda hot.

349
00:33:22,339 --> 00:33:24,195
Thank you.

350
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:30,658
- Attaboy. Taste
pretty good? - Uh-huh.

351
00:33:33,258 --> 00:33:38,379
You don't have to stay.
What the heck. Might as well.

352
00:33:38,446 --> 00:33:40,357
I got some food
back there.

353
00:33:40,431 --> 00:33:44,045
I don't mean to be impolite,
but how come you're in the army?

354
00:33:44,113 --> 00:33:47,694
I couldn't stay out. Not
with the Nazis and Japanese...

355
00:33:47,764 --> 00:33:49,870
threatening
to conquer the world.

356
00:33:49,941 --> 00:33:53,239
I've got a boy your age seeing
action in the South Pacific.

357
00:33:53,304 --> 00:33:55,957
Hey, that's really something. Yeah.

358
00:33:56,026 --> 00:33:59,640
I used to tell my students there's
a monster loose in the world.

359
00:33:59,708 --> 00:34:02,557
I got tired of telling them, and I joined up.

360
00:34:02,622 --> 00:34:04,892
I thought you were a teacher. Oh, come on.

361
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:07,809
You have that confidence
and a very good way with words.

362
00:34:07,873 --> 00:34:12,666
I'll tell you one thing. We don't mince
phraseologies at Boston Trade and Industrial.

363
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:17,222
Oh, boy.

364
00:34:17,288 --> 00:34:20,039
I wonder if my father
were still alive if, uh...

365
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:23,115
I don't think he would of.

366
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:25,767
Don't you ever
sell him short, son.

367
00:34:25,838 --> 00:34:27,781
Mom would never
have let him.

368
00:34:27,855 --> 00:34:30,988
You couldn't
blame her, could you?

369
00:34:31,057 --> 00:34:33,929
But then
I'm lucky, I guess.

370
00:34:34,004 --> 00:34:36,526
Margaret's a very
understanding woman.

371
00:34:36,597 --> 00:34:38,420
We were
childhood sweethearts.

372
00:34:38,486 --> 00:34:42,646
Hey, that's nice. You got a girl back home?

373
00:34:42,713 --> 00:34:44,569
No one special.

374
00:34:44,634 --> 00:34:46,905
Margaret's the only woman
I've ever known.

375
00:34:47,965 --> 00:34:50,203
There's Margaret.

376
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:52,279
Aw, she looks awful nice.

377
00:34:52,352 --> 00:34:55,649
She's just about everything
a man could ask for.

378
00:34:57,315 --> 00:34:59,226
Oh, oh. What's this?

379
00:35:01,317 --> 00:35:03,206
That's my mom
in our backyard.

380
00:35:04,648 --> 00:35:07,367
Oh, you have
a very nice-looking mother.

381
00:35:09,835 --> 00:35:11,844
Yeah, she is.
Very nice.

382
00:35:11,917 --> 00:35:15,018
That's a nice house too.
That's the back.

383
00:35:15,087 --> 00:35:17,642
It's a nice yard.

384
00:35:17,713 --> 00:35:19,601
Nice.

385
00:35:21,363 --> 00:35:23,219
When did you enlist?

386
00:35:24,629 --> 00:35:27,249
It wasn't quite like that. I was drafted. Oh?

387
00:35:27,319 --> 00:35:31,829
It's not that I didn't want to go,
I just wanted to finish school first.

388
00:35:31,899 --> 00:35:35,414
Where were you in school? First year
of the Ilium School of Optometry.

389
00:35:35,485 --> 00:35:37,821
An optometrist.
That's a very good field.

390
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:42,624
Yes, 'cause you're doing things for people,
and there'll always be a need for optometrists.

391
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:44,578
Boy, what you just said...

392
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:48,508
is a very good
philosophical way of life.

393
00:35:48,582 --> 00:35:51,366
What? I mean about filling
a need and helping people.

394
00:35:51,431 --> 00:35:55,329
Why, that's self-determination and free
enterprise backing itself up all the way.

395
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:58,121
That's why we're in Europe
stopping Hitler.

396
00:35:58,189 --> 00:36:00,394
My name's Edgar Derby, son.
What's yours?

397
00:36:00,462 --> 00:36:04,076
Billy Pilgrim. Billy, it's
nice to have you aboard.

398
00:36:04,144 --> 00:36:06,000
Thank you. You had enough of that?

399
00:36:06,066 --> 00:36:07,922
Yes, I did.
Thank you.

400
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:14,671
The English gave me
these boots for ya.

401
00:36:14,743 --> 00:36:19,253
Don't mind the silver paint. They
did that for a skit about Cinderella.

402
00:36:19,323 --> 00:36:23,734
It was darn funny. It was a lot of
singin' and dancin' and crazy stuff.

403
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:25,879
Yeah, I admire the English.

404
00:36:25,951 --> 00:36:29,566
They have a great
philosophical way of life.

405
00:36:29,634 --> 00:36:33,019
Keep themselves going. Putting
on shows. Gilbert and Sullivan.

406
00:36:33,092 --> 00:36:35,679
What's this?

407
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:39,428
<i>#She's his sweetheart #</i>

408
00:36:40,553 --> 00:36:42,944
<i>#He's her vow #
Happy anniversary.</i>

409
00:36:43,019 --> 00:36:46,337
<i>#He's her Billy #</i>

410
00:36:46,413 --> 00:36:50,409
<i>#She's his Val #
Oh, Billy!</i>

411
00:36:50,479 --> 00:36:54,027
<i># They were married # Your
diamond! Why did you do it?</i>

412
00:36:54,098 --> 00:36:57,166
<i>#Never to part ## When I go
on this diet just for you,</i>

413
00:36:57,236 --> 00:36:59,147
I'm going to be so sexy.

414
00:36:59,222 --> 00:37:03,087
I'll make you so happy.
Just wait and see.

415
00:37:03,161 --> 00:37:05,813
Look. Isn't it divine?

416
00:37:05,882 --> 00:37:07,956
Goodness!

417
00:37:08,027 --> 00:37:11,128
This diamond
has a story to it.

418
00:37:11,198 --> 00:37:14,910
Billy actually found it
in Germany during the war.

419
00:37:14,976 --> 00:37:18,327
Billy, tell 'em about it. Oh,
go ahead, darling, tell them.

420
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:22,114
<i>No. Billy's too modest, so I'll tell you.</i>

421
00:37:22,181 --> 00:37:23,873
<i>When he was a prisoner
in this...</i>

422
00:37:23,943 --> 00:37:26,148
Good boy, Billy.
Thanks.

423
00:37:26,216 --> 00:37:28,706
<i>They gave him
an awful coat to wear.</i>

424
00:37:30,282 --> 00:37:34,311
Congrats, Billy.
What was his name, hon?

425
00:37:34,381 --> 00:37:38,246
<i>Who? The one that was killed in Dresden.</i>

426
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,710
- Edgar Derby.
- Oh, that's right.

427
00:37:40,785 --> 00:37:43,307
Poor old Edgar Derby.
Oh, that was really awful.

428
00:37:43,379 --> 00:37:47,157
They shot him for, uh...
What was it, Billy?

429
00:37:48,439 --> 00:37:50,327
Well, anyway,
before that,

430
00:37:50,392 --> 00:37:54,585
<i>they found this diamond right
in the pocket of Billy's coat.</i>

431
00:37:54,651 --> 00:37:59,029
<i>Lord knows how it got there, and Lord
knows why somebody didn't find it before.</i>

432
00:37:59,102 --> 00:38:02,006
<i>It probably came
from some poor old Jew.</i>

433
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,936
<i>So many of them
have their money in diamonds.</i>

434
00:38:04,001 --> 00:38:07,299
Jesus, Dad!
I'm on the john.

435
00:38:07,364 --> 00:38:11,043
My, God, Robert. There's a party
downstairs. Why don't you lock the door?

436
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:13,927
'Cause Mom broke the lock
the last time I locked it.

437
00:38:13,992 --> 00:38:17,290
Can't I have any privacy?
What have you got there?

438
00:38:17,354 --> 00:38:19,210
Where?
There.

439
00:38:27,313 --> 00:38:31,210
Shouldn't be reading
that kind of junk, Robert.

440
00:38:31,284 --> 00:38:33,707
Jesus!

441
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:53,595
<i>Lads. Lads.
Hey, Billy!</i>

442
00:38:53,667 --> 00:38:57,412
<i>- Billy. Over here.
Can I have your attention?</i>

443
00:38:57,478 --> 00:38:59,814
<i>Please, please, please.</i>

444
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:03,656
<i>You're being transferred
to a camp in Dresden.</i>

445
00:39:03,722 --> 00:39:07,434
You're going to be leaving
for there this afternoon.

446
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,323
Actually, I'm
quite envious of you.

447
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:11,693
<i>Dresden is a beautiful city.</i>

448
00:39:11,759 --> 00:39:14,510
<i>Paid a visit there myself
before the war.</i>

449
00:39:14,577 --> 00:39:16,433
Besides being quite lovely,
it's quite safe.

450
00:39:16,498 --> 00:39:20,494
<i>It's an open city without war
industries or troop concentrations.</i>

451
00:39:20,565 --> 00:39:24,791
It's by far the safest place to
be until we get this all over with.

452
00:39:24,856 --> 00:39:29,136
Now then, you must elect a leader. He's
going to be in charge of all this group.

453
00:39:29,211 --> 00:39:31,351
<i>You'll all be under
his direct orders,</i>

454
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:34,073
<i>and he will be your line of
communication with the Germans.</i>

455
00:39:34,142 --> 00:39:35,998
<i>Nominations are now open.</i>

456
00:39:41,891 --> 00:39:44,162
You need a leader.

457
00:39:44,229 --> 00:39:46,532
I nominate
Paul Lazzaro.

458
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:49,317
<i>Lazzaro. Right.</i>

459
00:39:49,385 --> 00:39:51,459
Anyone else?

460
00:39:54,124 --> 00:39:57,355
<i>Well, then...
I nominate Edgar Derby.</i>

461
00:39:57,422 --> 00:39:59,693
<i>Anyone else?</i>

462
00:40:01,265 --> 00:40:03,535
<i>You'll be responsible,
to this man you elect,</i>

463
00:40:03,602 --> 00:40:06,572
and he'll be responsible
to the Germans.

464
00:40:06,645 --> 00:40:09,232
<i>So if you mess him up, he's
the one they're gonna be after.</i>

465
00:40:09,302 --> 00:40:13,745
Oh, yeah? Hey, pop, you
want it so bad; you got it.

466
00:40:13,817 --> 00:40:15,761
I un-nominate Lazzaro.

467
00:40:15,835 --> 00:40:18,968
<i>I don't think it will come
as a surprise to anyone...</i>

468
00:40:19,037 --> 00:40:22,301
when I introduce our Lion's Club
president for the coming year.

469
00:40:22,367 --> 00:40:24,441
Our own Billy Pilgrim.

470
00:40:28,547 --> 00:40:32,957
<i>- The floor's all yours. Good luck.
- Oh, shut up, will ya?</i>

471
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:38,883
<i>Thank you.</i>

472
00:40:38,955 --> 00:40:41,193
<i>Thank you.</i>

473
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:51,826
Thank you.

474
00:40:54,228 --> 00:40:56,084
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

475
00:40:57,751 --> 00:41:01,648
Thank you. Mr. Walters. Fellow Lions.

476
00:41:03,675 --> 00:41:07,573
I want you to know I will do
my best to live up to the...

477
00:41:07,645 --> 00:41:12,253
Confidence you've showed by "chosing"...
choose... by having chose me here today.

478
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:19,713
- Uh, and I know that
my first responsibility...

479
00:41:21,511 --> 00:41:24,480
Is to see that each of you
gets through this safely...

480
00:41:24,553 --> 00:41:26,791
<i>and are reunited
with your loved ones.</i>

481
00:41:30,028 --> 00:41:33,478
<i>I'd like to ask you... I know
we're all of different faiths,</i>

482
00:41:33,551 --> 00:41:35,887
but we're all Americans...

483
00:41:35,952 --> 00:41:38,442
<i>Oh, God.</i>

484
00:41:38,515 --> 00:41:40,785
To bow our heads together
and pray.

485
00:41:40,852 --> 00:41:42,795
<i>Oh, go take a flying fuck!</i>

486
00:41:42,869 --> 00:41:46,766
<i>If that isn't
the most obscene vulgar... Oh!</i>

487
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:49,111
<i>Is my bath ready,
Silvio?</i>

488
00:41:49,178 --> 00:41:51,034
Yes, Miss.

489
00:41:52,444 --> 00:41:54,234
My robe, Silvio.

490
00:41:54,301 --> 00:41:58,046
Honestly, to show this kind of junk
at a family drive-in. It's disgraceful!

491
00:41:58,112 --> 00:42:01,147
<i>Why do you avert your eyes
from me, Silvio?</i>

492
00:42:01,218 --> 00:42:05,280
<i>Why you wanted to take
the children to it is beyond me.</i>

493
00:42:05,349 --> 00:42:08,165
<i>Massalina can give you
salvation from... Oh, Robert!</i>

494
00:42:08,231 --> 00:42:12,260
You shouldn't see that! Mom! Hey!

495
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:15,048
Do you find Massalina
unattractive?

496
00:42:15,116 --> 00:42:16,840
- Oh, gross!
- Wow!

497
00:42:16,908 --> 00:42:20,806
<i>- That's enough!
- Jesus, Mom! They show more in health class.</i>

498
00:42:20,879 --> 00:42:22,855
Take us home. I don't want
to hear another word.

499
00:42:22,928 --> 00:42:25,385
<i>- Silvio. - Did
you hear me? - Shit!</i>

500
00:42:25,458 --> 00:42:29,258
I will not tolerate that kind of
language in front of me, goddamn it!

501
00:42:29,332 --> 00:42:32,334
<i>I am not going to subject
myself to that filth...</i>

502
00:42:32,407 --> 00:42:34,864
or allow my children
to be subjected to it.

503
00:42:34,937 --> 00:42:37,110
<i>Billy, I am talking to you!</i>

504
00:42:37,178 --> 00:42:38,870
Come on.

505
00:42:38,939 --> 00:42:43,219
<i>Silvio. Silvio.
Billy!</i>

506
00:42:43,423 --> 00:42:47,768
<i>Billy. Billy!
Come here.</i>

507
00:42:54,054 --> 00:42:57,471
See how you like this one.
"Dear Meg,

508
00:42:57,544 --> 00:43:02,665
"We're on our way to Dresden where we'll
have to do some work for the Germans.

509
00:43:02,732 --> 00:43:06,280
"It won't be war work because the
Geneva Convention prohibits that,

510
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:08,970
<i>"and besides, there isn't
any war production in Dresden.</i>

511
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:13,352
"Dresden is the town where our
little dancing figure came from.

512
00:43:13,426 --> 00:43:16,145
Remember the one thatJohnny
knocked off the table and broke?"

513
00:43:18,518 --> 00:43:22,133
"Dresden's never been bombed
because it isn't a military target,

514
00:43:22,201 --> 00:43:24,307
"so we'll be safe there.

515
00:43:24,378 --> 00:43:27,796
"Please write toJohnny
and give him all my love,

516
00:43:27,869 --> 00:43:31,581
<i>"and tell him I know we'll all
be back together again soon.</i>

517
00:43:31,647 --> 00:43:33,623
Tell him how proud
I am of him. "

518
00:43:46,729 --> 00:43:49,896
Where is he? Your boy's
in the car, Mr. Pilgrim.

519
00:43:49,964 --> 00:43:51,852
He's the only one
we actually caught.

520
00:43:51,917 --> 00:43:54,952
They knocked over 14 gravestones, all told.

521
00:43:55,023 --> 00:43:57,807
I can't understand
why he'd do such a thing.

522
00:43:57,872 --> 00:44:00,296
<i>Has he ever said anything
about Catholics?</i>

523
00:44:00,371 --> 00:44:04,301
<i>- I mean, has he anything against them?
- We've got Catholic friends.</i>

524
00:44:04,373 --> 00:44:08,370
What will the McNalley's think? What
are we going to say to the McNalley's?

525
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,830
Mr. Pilgrim,
if I could see you up here.

526
00:44:10,906 --> 00:44:13,209
My, God!
Why did he do it?

527
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:16,212
I don't want to take the
boy down to the station.

528
00:44:16,285 --> 00:44:18,174
It might be
embarrassing to you.

529
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:21,820
<i>- Maybe we could handle it in some other way.
- Thank you, Officer.</i>

530
00:44:21,889 --> 00:44:25,503
If you can get the damages from
the church, I'd pay for that.

531
00:44:25,571 --> 00:44:27,874
I'll see what I can do.

532
00:44:27,941 --> 00:44:32,352
And I'd like to show my appreciation by
giving you this for the policeman's fund.

533
00:44:32,424 --> 00:44:37,064
You don't have to do that, Mr.
Pilgrim, but it's very generous of you.

534
00:44:37,131 --> 00:44:40,582
<i>I'll call you after we've been able
to determine the extent of the damages.</i>

535
00:44:40,654 --> 00:44:42,957
What's the matter, Billy?

536
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,929
You must be the greatest father in the world.

537
00:44:50,068 --> 00:44:52,558
I love my son, Billy.

538
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:54,518
Guess that's all it takes.

539
00:44:56,024 --> 00:44:57,683
Hey, you guys.
We're there.

540
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:07,381
<i>It's beautiful.</i>

541
00:45:07,456 --> 00:45:11,233
I never saw anything like it. It's lovely.

542
00:45:11,298 --> 00:45:13,602
<i>It's the Land of Oz.</i>

543
00:45:44,473 --> 00:45:47,410
<i>Herr Kommandant.</i>

544
00:46:31,257 --> 00:46:34,074
<i>Where's kommandant?</i>

545
00:46:38,269 --> 00:46:42,396
<i>I'm the American kommandant.</i>

546
00:46:47,267 --> 00:46:49,123
These men...
I'm the American...

547
00:46:50,598 --> 00:46:52,574
Guess you better go.

548
00:46:52,647 --> 00:46:55,649
Okay, men. Everybody
on the other side.

549
00:46:58,603 --> 00:47:01,420
<i>Ich bin
the American kommandant.</i>

550
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:03,341
Perhaps you
understand English.

551
00:47:03,407 --> 00:47:06,343
Back at the camp, the men
chose me... Go back in line.

552
00:47:06,416 --> 00:47:10,575
I was told
to take charge.

553
00:47:10,644 --> 00:47:13,875
Okay, fellas.
Move out. Move out.

554
00:50:21,909 --> 00:50:24,594
<i>Don't fool around
with any oo-la-las.</i>

555
00:50:24,662 --> 00:50:27,152
<i>How can I cheat
with your old man around?</i>

556
00:50:27,225 --> 00:50:29,943
That won't be so hard.
We just make an agreement.

557
00:50:30,011 --> 00:50:32,882
You don't talk, and I don't
talk. Daddy, shame on you!

558
00:50:32,956 --> 00:50:35,675
Hey, come on, Billy.
We're on our way.

559
00:50:35,742 --> 00:50:39,060
- Bye-bye, Barb. - Bye,
Val. - Have a good time.

560
00:50:39,136 --> 00:50:43,394
Bye, sweetheart. Have a good
time. Bye. Bye, hon. Okay.

561
00:50:46,085 --> 00:50:48,509
Bye.

562
00:50:56,268 --> 00:50:58,178
I know there's
gonna be meetings,

563
00:50:58,253 --> 00:51:01,103
but I really mostly
want you to enjoy yourself.

564
00:51:01,167 --> 00:51:04,682
By God, you deserve it.
You really do.

565
00:51:04,753 --> 00:51:06,860
Want me to tell you
a secret, huh?

566
00:51:06,931 --> 00:51:09,650
I wouldn't tell anybody this,
of course, but...

567
00:51:09,717 --> 00:51:13,843
when Valencia brought you home and wanted to
marry you, to tell you the honest-to-God truth,

568
00:51:13,912 --> 00:51:16,335
I thought she'd brought home
a first-class loser!

569
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:18,833
<i>I really thought that.
But you proved me wrong.</i>

570
00:51:18,907 --> 00:51:21,527
<i>I'm the first
to admit it.</i>

571
00:51:21,597 --> 00:51:24,316
<i>You proved
old Lionel wrong.</i>

572
00:51:27,041 --> 00:51:28,897
Dad?

573
00:51:36,903 --> 00:51:38,846
<i>Fine family man,
and I'm...</i>

574
00:51:51,729 --> 00:51:55,080
The plane's gonna crash.
Oh, come on, Billy-boy!

575
00:51:55,155 --> 00:51:57,295
In 25 minutes,
the whole thing cracks up.

576
00:51:57,365 --> 00:51:59,822
You can't get out
of your seat!

577
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,409
Stop the plane. No one's
allowed in the cockpit, sir.

578
00:52:03,482 --> 00:52:07,576
It's gonna crash. I organized this charter;
I'm responsible... Do you want to be removed?

579
00:52:07,644 --> 00:52:10,428
But you don't understand! We've
got our clearance for the takeoff.

580
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:14,359
Everything's going to be all
right. Leave the driving to us.

581
00:52:14,433 --> 00:52:17,817
Lousy drunk son of a bitch! God,
I hate these charter flights.

582
00:52:29,419 --> 00:52:32,717
<i># Oh, there's a change in the weather,

you will say Schlachthof-funf.

599
00:53:54,757 --> 00:53:57,344
<i>Say it, please. Schlacht.
Schlacht.</i>

600
00:53:57,414 --> 00:54:00,547
- Hof.
- Hof.

601
00:54:00,617 --> 00:54:02,822
- Funf!
- Funf.

602
00:54:02,890 --> 00:54:08,229
- Schlachthof-funf.
- Schlachthof-funf.

603
00:54:08,302 --> 00:54:10,408
Schlachthof-funf.

604
00:54:25,785 --> 00:54:27,892
<i>Funf.</i>

605
00:54:29,244 --> 00:54:32,727
<i>Schlacht... hof...</i>

606
00:54:32,799 --> 00:54:34,655
<i>funf.</i>

607
00:54:37,986 --> 00:54:39,962
<i>Schlacht...</i>

608
00:54:40,035 --> 00:54:42,687
hof.

609
00:54:42,757 --> 00:54:46,055
Schlachthof-funf.

610
00:54:46,119 --> 00:54:48,903
Schlachthof-funf.

611
00:54:50,666 --> 00:54:53,483
Hof... funf.

612
00:54:53,548 --> 00:54:55,819
Schlachthof-funf.

613
00:55:01,042 --> 00:55:03,564
I'm coming, Billy!
I'm coming!

614
00:55:15,131 --> 00:55:18,067
I'm coming to you!

615
00:55:36,586 --> 00:55:40,166
<i>For God's sakes, lady! Why'd you jam
on your brakes? Look what you've done!</i>

616
00:55:40,236 --> 00:55:43,108
My Billy fell out
of a plane!

617
00:55:43,182 --> 00:55:46,414
You all right? I was on my way to
the hospital! I missed my entrance!

618
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:49,679
I'll drive you there. No!
It's in Vermont, stupid!

619
00:55:49,747 --> 00:55:51,853
Billy.

620
00:55:51,924 --> 00:55:54,861
Hey, let me see your
license! I haven't got time!

621
00:55:54,934 --> 00:55:58,035
You can't leave the scene
of an accident, lady!

622
00:55:59,257 --> 00:56:02,074
Your exhaust is shot to hell! Damn it, lady!

623
00:56:02,139 --> 00:56:06,485
<i>- You're goin'
the wrong way!</i>

624
00:56:19,046 --> 00:56:21,317
Get out of the way!

625
00:56:22,536 --> 00:56:24,326
<i>Goddamn!
Get outta the way!</i>

626
00:56:29,549 --> 00:56:32,900
<i>First she backed into me. Then
she went the wrong way and...</i>

627
00:56:34,033 --> 00:56:35,725
Oh, my God,
here she comes again.

628
00:57:03,204 --> 00:57:06,916
I'm coming to you,
Billy. I'm coming!

629
00:57:08,231 --> 00:57:09,093
<i>- Sweetheart. Honey?
- Hmm.</i>

630
00:57:10,248 --> 00:57:12,901
Huh? What? Wake up, wake up. Wake up!

631
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:14,827
What?

632
00:57:16,814 --> 00:57:19,783
Here.
What is this?

633
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:24,872
Billy! What is this?

634
00:57:24,947 --> 00:57:27,567
Follow it and find out.
Billy!

635
00:57:27,637 --> 00:57:31,087
Come on. Oh, Billy. You're
always up to something.

636
00:57:31,159 --> 00:57:33,943
You're wonderful.
Thank you. Beautiful!

637
00:57:34,009 --> 00:57:38,268
But did you make this bow? Never mind
the bow. Follow the yellow-brick road.

638
00:57:38,332 --> 00:57:40,243
Follow the yellow-brick road!

639
00:57:43,071 --> 00:57:46,935
Follow the yellow-brick road!
Oh, Billy! Come on. Follow it.

640
00:57:47,009 --> 00:57:49,345
Billy!

641
00:57:49,411 --> 00:57:51,617
Come on, Mama! Follow.

642
00:57:51,685 --> 00:57:53,574
Follow the yellow-brick road!

643
00:57:53,638 --> 00:57:56,509
<i>Mom! Come on down, Mom.
Did you really make this bow?</i>

644
00:57:56,584 --> 00:57:59,269
<i>Never mind.
Mom! Hurry!</i>

645
00:57:59,339 --> 00:58:01,991
I'm coming.
Robert!

646
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:05,358
<i>Mom, hurry.</i>

647
00:58:05,422 --> 00:58:09,101
Billy! Billy,
I can't go out like this.

648
00:58:09,169 --> 00:58:11,559
Of course you can.
Follow the golden thread.

649
00:58:13,651 --> 00:58:16,687
A Cadillac!
Oh, Billy!

650
00:58:16,758 --> 00:58:20,022
Happy birthday, hon.
Happy birthday, Mom!

651
00:58:22,266 --> 00:58:24,569
A Cadillac!
A white Cadillac!

652
00:58:24,635 --> 00:58:27,954
It's what I've
always wanted!

653
00:58:28,029 --> 00:58:29,853
Come on, Robert!

654
00:58:29,919 --> 00:58:32,026
I've always wanted
a white Cadillac!

655
00:58:32,097 --> 00:58:36,256
Oh, Billy. Oh, sweetheart.
And now you've got it.

656
00:58:36,323 --> 00:58:39,391
Oh, it's a little tight. You can
adjust the seat with this, see?

657
00:58:39,461 --> 00:58:41,667
Oh, no, no! That's too tight! Or backward.

658
00:58:41,735 --> 00:58:44,158
You can make it go up...
Oh, no! It's squishing me!

659
00:58:44,233 --> 00:58:47,017
Or down.
It's wonderful!

660
00:58:47,082 --> 00:58:52,006
I'm gonna lose weight! Oh, I'm really
gonna, Billy. I love you. I love you.

661
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:11,248
Get the stretcher! Quick!

662
00:59:38,381 --> 00:59:41,417
<i>- Was he alert in the emergency room?
- No, not very.</i>

663
00:59:41,487 --> 00:59:43,856
<i>His right eye was dilating
and his blood pressure was up.</i>

664
00:59:43,921 --> 00:59:45,744
<i>He seemed pretty drowsy.</i>

665
00:59:45,810 --> 00:59:47,917
<i>He's shaved
and prepped, Doctor.</i>

666
00:59:47,988 --> 00:59:51,121
Let's get the pressure off. Are
the instruments ready? Yes, Doctor.

667
00:59:53,527 --> 00:59:57,785
<i>Better get in quickly, Bill. His
right pupil no longer reacts to light.</i>

668
00:59:57,851 --> 00:59:59,226
Scalpel.

669
01:00:08,066 --> 01:00:09,922
<i>Cautery.</i>

670
01:00:16,007 --> 01:00:19,938
<i>Electric burr.</i>

671
01:00:22,251 --> 01:00:24,162
<i>Let me have some saline.</i>

672
01:00:24,236 --> 01:00:29,455
<i>Each day, you will recite your number
so we'll know how many men are here.</i>

673
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:33,199
There'll be no talkin'
to Germans unless talked to.

674
01:00:33,266 --> 01:00:35,569
When the war is over,
we'll talk.

675
01:00:35,636 --> 01:00:39,948
<i>Let's make another
burr hole right here.</i>

676
01:00:40,023 --> 01:00:43,342
<i>Each day, you will be given
a working assignment...</i>

677
01:00:43,417 --> 01:00:46,136
for factory,
cleaning or mail.

678
01:00:46,203 --> 01:00:48,823
But there is not going to be
any talking to German.

679
01:00:48,893 --> 01:00:51,764
<i>When you talk, you talk
to your guards only.</i>

680
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:55,137
<i>Blood pressure is falling off.</i>

681
01:00:56,418 --> 01:00:59,649
<i>Eins, zwei!
Eins, zwei! Eins, zwei!</i>

682
01:01:19,826 --> 01:01:21,802
<i>What are you giving him?</i>

683
01:01:21,875 --> 01:01:23,917
<i>I'm still giving him D5W.</i>

684
01:01:44,194 --> 01:01:47,131
<i>It looks like the pressure's
coming up now.</i>

685
01:01:47,205 --> 01:01:49,311
<i>Let's see how we do in
the next five or 10 minutes.</i>

686
01:02:05,424 --> 01:02:07,630
Mrs. Shaw?

687
01:02:07,698 --> 01:02:10,383
I'm Doctor Ellenbogen. Your
father's gonna be all right.

688
01:02:10,452 --> 01:02:14,251
It was very difficult, but
he came through in good shape.

689
01:02:14,326 --> 01:02:16,783
Stanley, he's gonna
be all right!

690
01:02:16,856 --> 01:02:19,924
Wonderful.
Did you find Mother?

691
01:02:19,994 --> 01:02:23,313
Well, it... it's crazy,
Barbara. L... I don't understand.

692
01:02:23,389 --> 01:02:25,878
What's crazy, Stanley?
Where's Mama?

693
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:28,253
Come on, honey.
L- Let's sit down.

694
01:02:30,498 --> 01:02:34,941
Listen. I think we'll take care of your
father till he's able to take care of himself.

695
01:02:35,012 --> 01:02:36,901
What are you talking about?

696
01:02:36,966 --> 01:02:39,619
Well, I looked all over
for your mom,

697
01:02:39,688 --> 01:02:41,729
and then I asked
one of the nurses.

698
01:02:41,801 --> 01:02:44,323
And they said that...

699
01:02:44,395 --> 01:02:47,397
that she died about
three hours ago.

700
01:02:47,469 --> 01:02:51,050
So I had to find out
if it was the right one.

701
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:53,096
And it was.

702
01:02:53,169 --> 01:02:55,058
She was.

703
01:02:59,029 --> 01:03:02,031
How?
I don't know, uh...

704
01:03:03,192 --> 01:03:05,365
She had some kind of
accident with the car...

705
01:03:05,434 --> 01:03:08,502
and got carbon monoxide
poisoning.

706
01:03:10,525 --> 01:03:12,501
But she drives a Cadillac!

707
01:03:12,574 --> 01:03:15,194
Honey, I don't know.
That's what they told me.

708
01:03:19,427 --> 01:03:21,533
Oh, God.

709
01:03:21,604 --> 01:03:23,908
I know. I know.

710
01:03:25,607 --> 01:03:28,773
<i>Hi, darling. How you feeling?</i>

711
01:03:28,841 --> 01:03:32,073
Dirty sons of bitches.
Bureaucratic bastards.

712
01:03:32,139 --> 01:03:34,858
They have the audacity to put me
in a room with a basket case.

713
01:03:34,925 --> 01:03:38,276
<i>- Theyjust don't have a private room, sweetheart.
- Well, I don't know...</i>

714
01:03:38,351 --> 01:03:40,207
Goddamn it, Lily!

715
01:03:40,272 --> 01:03:44,978
I'm gonna pepper your Radcliffe ass with
buckshot if I catch you smoking again!

716
01:03:45,044 --> 01:03:48,559
You better stay in condition
to keep up with B.C. Rumfoord.

717
01:03:48,630 --> 01:03:52,462
- You guys go on without me.
I'll be all right.

718
01:03:52,537 --> 01:03:55,059
<i>Christ. All he does
in his sleep...</i>

719
01:03:55,131 --> 01:03:57,784
is quit and surrender
and apologize.

720
01:03:57,853 --> 01:04:01,980
Shoot. I could carve
a better man out of a banana.

721
01:04:02,048 --> 01:04:03,904
Did you bring me those
books from Widener?

722
01:04:03,969 --> 01:04:08,249
<i>The boys at the Harvard Crimson
have a beautiful bit about you. Oh?</i>

723
01:04:08,324 --> 01:04:11,905
They call you the Red Baron
of military history...

724
01:04:11,974 --> 01:04:15,905
And want you
to get well soon.

725
01:04:15,977 --> 01:04:17,833
Those little bastards!

726
01:04:17,898 --> 01:04:21,064
The Truman statement
about Hiroshima is in here,

727
01:04:21,132 --> 01:04:23,916
and those eight
Army Air Force documents.

728
01:04:23,982 --> 01:04:25,838
Oh, yeah.

729
01:04:25,904 --> 01:04:29,835
<i>And the Irving book on Dresden. I was there.</i>

730
01:04:29,907 --> 01:04:33,422
<i>Honey, why did they keep Dresden
a secret for so long?</i>

731
01:04:33,493 --> 01:04:35,950
Oh, hell. For fear
a lot of bleeding hearts...

732
01:04:36,023 --> 01:04:38,512
would say bombing it
was a chickenshit thing to do.

733
01:04:38,584 --> 01:04:41,882
My book's gonna lay it
on the line, sweetheart.

734
01:04:41,947 --> 01:04:46,041
Nobody's gonna weep and wail over
Dresden after they read my book.

735
01:04:46,109 --> 01:04:49,428
I was there.

736
01:04:49,503 --> 01:04:52,572
What's he saying?
He said he was there.

737
01:04:52,642 --> 01:04:54,585
Says he was where?

738
01:04:54,659 --> 01:04:59,037
Dresden.
At Dresden, B. C!

739
01:05:03,369 --> 01:05:06,218
The hell with him.
Let him write his own book.

740
01:06:21,021 --> 01:06:23,390
<i>Schlachthof-funf.</i>

741
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:27,228
<i>What the hell is he saying now?</i>

742
01:06:27,298 --> 01:06:30,333
<i>Ich bin Amerikanische soldat.</i>

743
01:06:30,404 --> 01:06:32,228
Dresden.

744
01:06:35,816 --> 01:06:38,917
<i>Schlachthof-funf. You wanna know something?</i>

745
01:06:38,986 --> 01:06:42,566
We didn't start the last war;
the Nazis did.

746
01:06:42,637 --> 01:06:45,322
And 135,000 people
dying in Dresden...

747
01:06:45,390 --> 01:06:50,609
<i>does not seem so very much when put against
over five million Allies who had to die!</i>

748
01:06:50,674 --> 01:06:53,065
<i>And you just might remember that
when we were bombing Dresden,</i>

749
01:06:53,139 --> 01:06:56,851
<i>the Germans were sending V-1
and V-2 rockets into London,</i>

750
01:06:56,918 --> 01:06:59,221
<i>killing men,
women and children.</i>

751
01:06:59,287 --> 01:07:02,421
<i>Don't get so uptight.
Jesus!</i>

752
01:07:02,490 --> 01:07:06,933
<i>It gives me a pain:: Weeping over Dresden
and not give a damn about our own losses!</i>

753
01:07:07,005 --> 01:07:10,356
<i>Hey, what about Coventry?
What about Rotterdam?</i>

754
01:07:10,431 --> 01:07:13,183
<i>What about the extermination
camps the Germans were running?</i>

755
01:07:13,249 --> 01:07:15,706
<i>Gassing millions?</i>

756
01:07:49,626 --> 01:07:51,482
I want your attention.

757
01:08:07,366 --> 01:08:10,182
Attention, please.
You are having a visitor.

758
01:08:10,248 --> 01:08:13,152
Howard Campbell, Junior.

759
01:08:13,226 --> 01:08:16,643
I have just come back from the
Russian Front, so I'll make it short.

760
01:08:16,716 --> 01:08:20,013
I know how hungry you are.
Food's not much though, is it?

761
01:08:20,078 --> 01:08:23,429
<i>Food's terrifiic!
Almost as neat as your outfit!</i>

762
01:08:23,505 --> 01:08:26,059
Men, I have a proposition for you.

763
01:08:26,131 --> 01:08:29,646
How would you like to come back to
America after this war as heroes?

764
01:08:29,717 --> 01:08:32,337
Great, as long as I could
wear that fag outfit!

765
01:08:42,685 --> 01:08:46,779
Since you're so interested in my
outfit, I'll tell you what it's about.

766
01:08:46,848 --> 01:08:49,632
Blue is for the American sky.

767
01:08:49,699 --> 01:08:52,067
White is for the race that
pioneered that continent,

768
01:08:52,131 --> 01:08:56,674
cleared the forests, drained the
swamps, built the roads and the bridges.

769
01:08:56,743 --> 01:08:59,297
And the red is for the blood
of fine American boys...

770
01:08:59,368 --> 01:09:02,021
that's been shed
in defense of your freedom.

771
01:09:04,044 --> 01:09:07,843
I don't see you shedding
any blood, Campbell.

772
01:09:07,918 --> 01:09:11,019
<i>You all know that communism
is out to enslave the world.</i>

773
01:09:11,089 --> 01:09:14,288
And who's out there
trying to stop them?

774
01:09:14,355 --> 01:09:18,187
<i>The Germans! They're not your
enemies. They're your allies!</i>

775
01:09:18,262 --> 01:09:20,532
<i>Communism is the enemy
of all of us!</i>

776
01:09:20,599 --> 01:09:24,016
- I want volunteers for
the Free American Corps.

777
01:09:24,089 --> 01:09:27,288
<i>- Men who are willing to stand up to these commies.
- Sit down, Lazzaro!</i>

778
01:09:27,356 --> 01:09:30,008
<i>I didn't vote for you,
Derby. Good. Now, who's next?</i>

779
01:09:30,078 --> 01:09:33,877
<i>- If we don't stop them...
- Everybody to the air shelter.</i>

780
01:09:33,952 --> 01:09:37,150
Move. Let's go!
Get outta my way.

781
01:09:37,219 --> 01:09:40,417
There'll be no bombs. Churchill's
nephew lives in Dresden.

782
01:10:04,021 --> 01:10:06,062
Don't worry, soldier.

783
01:10:16,349 --> 01:10:19,613
Well, men, do I have
only one volunteer?

784
01:10:19,679 --> 01:10:23,992
Listen, pal. I only stood up back there to tell
you that one day your doorbell's gonna ring,

785
01:10:24,066 --> 01:10:26,107
and there's gonna be this guy
in a trench coat...

786
01:10:26,179 --> 01:10:28,832
We'll eat German craw for so
long, Campbell, because we have to.

787
01:10:28,902 --> 01:10:30,910
<i>But we'd rather die
than eat your dung,</i>

788
01:10:30,982 --> 01:10:33,122
which is sick and lousy
and foul!

789
01:10:33,193 --> 01:10:35,169
History will prove you
an ass.

790
01:10:39,597 --> 01:10:42,446
Oh, shit.

791
01:10:45,008 --> 01:10:46,952
No bombs,
eh, Campbell?

792
01:10:47,026 --> 01:10:48,936
You can't trust
theJews.

793
01:11:26,348 --> 01:11:28,521
Daddy, you should really
stay with us.

794
01:11:28,590 --> 01:11:30,631
And you shouldn't talk
about Mama...

795
01:11:30,703 --> 01:11:33,520
or the accident,
or even the war.

796
01:11:33,585 --> 01:11:36,620
I just wanna go home.
But we want you with us!

797
01:11:36,691 --> 01:11:38,995
I'll be fine.
Just for one night?

798
01:11:39,061 --> 01:11:41,616
No.
Oh, Daddy. Honestly!

799
01:11:58,850 --> 01:12:02,147
Daddy, you should
consider yourself lucky.

800
01:12:02,212 --> 01:12:05,281
Practically every optometrist
in Ilium was wiped out.

801
01:12:05,351 --> 01:12:07,556
<i>Stanley's been working
night and day for you.</i>

802
01:12:07,624 --> 01:12:10,146
Stinking old dog.

803
01:12:20,881 --> 01:12:24,429
Hello, Spot.
Yeah.

804
01:12:30,424 --> 01:12:32,115
Yeah.

805
01:12:32,185 --> 01:12:34,258
Daddy, honestly!

806
01:12:38,845 --> 01:12:42,622
<i>Won't you please change your
mind and come stay with us?</i>

807
01:12:42,687 --> 01:12:46,749
You'll be in this empty house
with that old dog.

808
01:12:46,819 --> 01:12:49,920
I'll be all right.
But, Daddy, be realistic.

809
01:12:49,989 --> 01:12:54,018
You just turned middle-aged. You've
got your whole life ahead of you.

810
01:12:54,088 --> 01:12:56,544
Good night, dear.

811
01:15:19,979 --> 01:15:23,975
Ja, schweine!
Verfluchen schweine!

812
01:16:29,753 --> 01:16:32,373
Mama!
Mama!

813
01:16:32,443 --> 01:16:34,266
Mama! Mama!

814
01:16:40,001 --> 01:16:42,009
<i>- Dad? Dad?
Papa!</i>

815
01:16:47,398 --> 01:16:50,215
Dad?

816
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:52,136
Robert?

817
01:16:54,442 --> 01:16:57,543
Hiya, Dad.
Hi, Spot.

818
01:16:59,245 --> 01:17:01,418
How did you get here?

819
01:17:01,487 --> 01:17:04,456
Well, they... They gave
me leave to visit Mom.

820
01:17:04,529 --> 01:17:07,663
But you know...
Sure, Dad. I know.

821
01:17:07,731 --> 01:17:11,508
That's why I'm here.
And to see you.

822
01:17:14,103 --> 01:17:18,481
How are you, Dad?
I'm fine.

823
01:17:18,554 --> 01:17:22,834
God, Dad. To think that
you lived. It's a miracle.

824
01:17:22,909 --> 01:17:25,693
Like one time when a chopper
got hit by Charlie,

825
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:27,833
just outside our camp.

826
01:17:27,904 --> 01:17:30,492
<i>It came down like,
like a stone.</i>

827
01:17:30,563 --> 01:17:32,736
<i>But the door gunner
walked away.</i>

828
01:17:34,245 --> 01:17:37,247
<i>Dad?</i>

829
01:17:37,319 --> 01:17:40,321
<i>Dad, I-I did the right
thing, joining up.</i>

830
01:17:40,393 --> 01:17:42,664
I'm sure you did, son.

831
01:17:42,731 --> 01:17:47,523
Aah, it's a lousy war, but sooner or
later it's gonna be us or the communists.

832
01:17:47,598 --> 01:17:49,705
<i>We've gotta stand up
to them somewhere.</i>

833
01:17:51,408 --> 01:17:53,264
<i>Dad?</i>

834
01:17:54,771 --> 01:17:56,714
Dad?

835
01:17:58,806 --> 01:18:02,638
I know you and Mom
worried about me a lot.

836
01:18:02,712 --> 01:18:04,786
I guess I haven't been
the best of sons.

837
01:18:04,857 --> 01:18:08,569
You've been just fine, Robert.
No, I... I know I was pretty wild,

838
01:18:08,637 --> 01:18:11,388
and I want to make up
for it.

839
01:18:11,454 --> 01:18:14,326
Remember that stuff
in the cemetery? Geez!

840
01:18:14,401 --> 01:18:17,119
I'm so ashamed of that now.
Really, I am.

841
01:18:18,371 --> 01:18:20,161
But I've changed
a lot, Dad.

842
01:18:22,117 --> 01:18:25,732
And I just hope I can make you
real proud of me from now on.

843
01:18:27,305 --> 01:18:29,162
You already have, Robert.

844
01:18:32,909 --> 01:18:35,945
Dad, will you come
to Mom's grave with me?

845
01:18:37,552 --> 01:18:40,107
I'm not ready yet.

846
01:18:40,178 --> 01:18:41,968
I know how you feel, Dad.

847
01:18:47,703 --> 01:18:50,126
I'm just not ready.

848
01:18:53,435 --> 01:18:55,291
Okay, Dad.

849
01:20:26,010 --> 01:20:27,920
What's happened?

850
01:20:30,172 --> 01:20:32,595
Where am I?

851
01:20:32,670 --> 01:20:35,988
<i>Welcome to the planet
Tralfamadore, Mr. Pilgrim.</i>

852
01:20:36,064 --> 01:20:37,975
Tralfam...

853
01:20:38,050 --> 01:20:41,151
<i>Tralfama...
Tralfamadore.</i>

854
01:20:41,220 --> 01:20:43,840
<i>Oh.</i>

855
01:20:45,575 --> 01:20:49,538
<i>How did I get here? There is no
"how,"Mr. Pilgrim. There is no why.</i>

856
01:20:49,609 --> 01:20:52,229
<i>The moment simply is.</i>

857
01:20:53,932 --> 01:20:56,202
<i>I don't understand.</i>

858
01:20:56,270 --> 01:21:00,102
<i>Where are you? Oh, you
can't see us, Mr. Pilgrim.</i>

859
01:21:00,176 --> 01:21:03,561
<i>We live in the fourth dimension.
But we can see you,</i>

860
01:21:03,635 --> 01:21:07,435
<i>and there are many important
Tralfamadorians here to welcome you.</i>

861
01:21:07,509 --> 01:21:11,953
<i>Oh. Well, uh,
how do you do?</i>

862
01:21:12,025 --> 01:21:15,540
<i>We hope that you'll find your
accommodations here suitable.</i>

863
01:21:15,611 --> 01:21:18,068
I have to stay here?

864
01:21:18,141 --> 01:21:20,696
<i>I'm afraid so.</i>

865
01:21:20,767 --> 01:21:24,566
You mean, I can't leave
of my own free will?

866
01:21:24,641 --> 01:21:29,346
<i>Mr. Pilgrim, we have visited 31
inhabited planets in the universe.</i>

867
01:21:29,412 --> 01:21:32,644
<i>We have studied reports
on a hundred more,</i>

868
01:21:32,711 --> 01:21:37,089
<i>and only on Earth
is there any talk of free will.</i>

869
01:21:40,107 --> 01:21:42,826
Well...
What'll I do?

870
01:21:46,415 --> 01:21:50,477
<i>You will aid in the removal
of the bodies.</i>

871
01:21:50,547 --> 01:21:53,363
<i>Those that are identifiable...</i>

872
01:21:53,429 --> 01:21:55,285
will be tagged.

873
01:21:55,350 --> 01:22:00,055
Their personal effects will be
tagged and given to an officer.

874
01:22:00,121 --> 01:22:02,741
<i>There will be
a classifiication...</i>

875
01:22:02,811 --> 01:22:04,667
according to the degree...

876
01:22:04,732 --> 01:22:07,483
that the victim
can be identified.

877
01:22:07,550 --> 01:22:09,591
Any looting or stealing...

878
01:22:09,664 --> 01:22:11,837
will be dealt with
by a firing squad.

879
01:22:11,905 --> 01:22:13,761
Follow me.

880
01:22:40,084 --> 01:22:42,453
<i>It looked like
the end of the world.</i>

881
01:22:42,518 --> 01:22:45,138
<i>What looked like the end
of the world, Mr. Pilgrim?</i>

882
01:22:45,208 --> 01:22:47,249
<i>Dresden, after the bombing.</i>

883
01:22:47,321 --> 01:22:49,974
<i>Don't be so egocentric.</i>

884
01:22:50,043 --> 01:22:53,111
<i>We know how the world ends, and
it has nothing to do with Earth,</i>

885
01:22:53,181 --> 01:22:55,386
<i>except that it
gets wiped out too.</i>

886
01:22:55,454 --> 01:22:58,107
<i>Really? How does it end?</i>

887
01:22:58,176 --> 01:23:00,545
<i>While we're experimenting
with new fuels,</i>

888
01:23:00,610 --> 01:23:04,704
<i>a Tralfamadorian test pilot
panics, presses the wrong button,</i>

889
01:23:04,773 --> 01:23:06,629
<i>and the whole universe
disappears.</i>

890
01:23:06,694 --> 01:23:09,063
<i>But you have to stop him!</i>

891
01:23:09,128 --> 01:23:11,650
<i>If you know this, can't you keep
the pilot from pressing...</i>

892
01:23:11,721 --> 01:23:15,335
<i>He has always pressed it,
and he always will.</i>

893
01:23:15,404 --> 01:23:18,755
<i>We always let him,
and we always will let him.</i>

894
01:23:18,831 --> 01:23:20,687
<i>The moment is structured
that way.</i>

895
01:23:57,576 --> 01:24:01,507
<i>Mr. Pilgrim, a pleasant way
to spend eternity...</i>

896
01:24:01,579 --> 01:24:06,317
<i>is to ignore the bad times
and concentrate on the good.</i>

897
01:24:15,061 --> 01:24:17,845
It's... It's all right!
It's all right!

898
01:24:17,910 --> 01:24:21,076
Will you be quiet, please?
Will you please be quiet?

899
01:24:21,144 --> 01:24:23,382
<i>Can't you see
you're frightening her?</i>

900
01:24:23,450 --> 01:24:25,721
<i>Who are you?</i>

901
01:24:25,787 --> 01:24:27,829
<i>Who are you?</i>

902
01:24:27,901 --> 01:24:31,133
My name's Pilgrim.
What's this scene?

903
01:24:31,199 --> 01:24:34,846
<i>- Where are we?
- We're on a distant planet.</i>

904
01:24:34,914 --> 01:24:36,737
<i>Are you mating now?</i>

905
01:24:39,013 --> 01:24:42,463
<i>What?
Have you mated?</i>

906
01:24:45,193 --> 01:24:47,049
Who are you?

907
01:24:47,114 --> 01:24:49,931
<i>I'm a Tralfamadorian,
Miss Wildhack.</i>

908
01:24:51,693 --> 01:24:55,143
<i>A what? You're on the planet
Tralfamadore, Miss Wildhack,</i>

909
01:24:55,215 --> 01:24:58,960
<i>423 billion miles from Earth.</i>

910
01:24:59,026 --> 01:25:00,882
Oh, Jesus.

911
01:25:04,758 --> 01:25:09,202
Hey, hey. Hey.

912
01:25:13,948 --> 01:25:16,852
You're okay?
Yes, thank you.

913
01:25:16,926 --> 01:25:19,546
When were you born? What month? What month?

914
01:25:19,616 --> 01:25:22,433
What month?
July.

915
01:25:22,498 --> 01:25:25,664
What day? The fourth. The fourth ofJuly.

916
01:25:25,732 --> 01:25:27,872
You're practical, straightforward,
with a belief in others...

917
01:25:27,942 --> 01:25:31,490
based on your own integrity
and almost compulsive honesty.

918
01:25:33,129 --> 01:25:35,749
You're a moon child!

919
01:25:35,819 --> 01:25:38,373
Oh, you're a moon child.
I'm a what?

920
01:25:38,444 --> 01:25:41,676
A moon child. That's your sign.

921
01:25:41,743 --> 01:25:46,448
Were you born in the morning or the afternoon?
It doesn't matter. I don't have my charts.

922
01:25:46,514 --> 01:25:50,227
Miss Wildhack? Would you
like something to wear?

923
01:25:50,293 --> 01:25:53,775
Oh, yes.
Thank you very much.

924
01:25:53,847 --> 01:25:57,592
Um...
I was, uh...

925
01:25:57,657 --> 01:26:02,232
I was down in Palm Springs at a
home of a producer friend of mine,

926
01:26:02,300 --> 01:26:04,506
<i>sunning myself
by the pool.</i>

927
01:26:04,575 --> 01:26:07,643
That's why I'm like this.
I don't want halter marks.

928
01:26:07,712 --> 01:26:10,976
Naturally. And...

929
01:26:11,043 --> 01:26:14,974
all of a sudden,
it was like a... a ray...

930
01:26:15,045 --> 01:26:17,283
This is all I can offer. Thank you.

931
01:26:17,351 --> 01:26:21,631
And... I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.

932
01:26:21,706 --> 01:26:24,708
Th-That's all there is.
And the next thing, I was...

933
01:26:24,780 --> 01:26:28,776
I was here.
What's it like up here?

934
01:26:28,846 --> 01:26:31,052
I don't know because
we can't leave the dome.

935
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:34,351
<i>The atmosphere of Tralfamadore
is cyanide.</i>

936
01:26:34,418 --> 01:26:37,682
<i>It would be fatal to you
if you left the dome.</i>

937
01:26:37,749 --> 01:26:39,538
This is it?

938
01:26:39,606 --> 01:26:43,253
I'm... afraid so.

939
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:46,105
<i>How long will they keep
us here? I don't know.</i>

940
01:26:46,171 --> 01:26:49,588
<i>You are here,
you have always been here,</i>

941
01:26:49,661 --> 01:26:52,445
<i>and you will
always be here.</i>

942
01:26:54,656 --> 01:26:57,375
Is he trying to blow
my mind?

943
01:26:57,442 --> 01:26:59,549
No, no, no.
It all makes sense in a way.

944
01:26:59,620 --> 01:27:02,589
<i>You see, in Tralfamadore...
Would you please mate now?</i>

945
01:27:06,248 --> 01:27:10,212
Look. We're not going to put on
a show for you. That's one thing.

946
01:27:10,283 --> 01:27:12,706
Another is I demand you get
Miss Wildhack some clothing.

947
01:27:12,781 --> 01:27:15,401
<i>If she's cold, we can always
regulate the temperature.</i>

948
01:27:15,470 --> 01:27:17,577
<i>Now, you get down to Earth
and get Miss Wildhack...</i>

949
01:27:17,648 --> 01:27:19,788
a complete wardrobe,
and one that fits!

950
01:27:19,858 --> 01:27:22,577
What's your size?
I take a 10.

951
01:27:22,643 --> 01:27:26,574
But I have to take it in here
and let it out a little here.

952
01:27:26,646 --> 01:27:29,648
So, they'll have to bring a needle
and thread. Did you hear that?

953
01:27:29,720 --> 01:27:32,951
<i>And remember, Miss Wildhack
is used to the best.</i>

954
01:27:33,018 --> 01:27:34,808
Thanks! Uh...

955
01:27:34,876 --> 01:27:37,977
- Billy.
- Billy.

956
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:48,705
Now we would like
the night canopy.

957
01:27:48,773 --> 01:27:50,629
<i>Why do you wish
the night canopy?</i>

958
01:27:50,695 --> 01:27:52,998
<i>Because we want it!
Will you mate?</i>

959
01:27:53,064 --> 01:27:56,678
<i>We hardly know each other! Do you mind
if we take time to get better acquainted?</i>

960
01:27:56,746 --> 01:27:59,366
<i>You are acting very unnaturally.</i>

961
01:27:59,436 --> 01:28:02,570
We would like
the night canopy.

962
01:28:02,638 --> 01:28:06,121
<i>Oh, very well.</i>

963
01:28:08,883 --> 01:28:11,470
Would you like to sit
on the couch?

964
01:28:12,533 --> 01:28:16,693
Where is it?
Here. Just take my hand.

965
01:28:16,760 --> 01:28:18,736
Ooh!
Ooh! I'm sorry.

966
01:28:18,810 --> 01:28:21,266
Um, that's all right.

967
01:28:25,566 --> 01:28:29,146
Careful.
Get away, Spot.

968
01:28:30,337 --> 01:28:33,471
He's not bothering me.
I like dogs.

969
01:28:33,539 --> 01:28:35,395
Come here, Spot.
Come on.

970
01:28:36,613 --> 01:28:39,648
It's pretty comfortable, isn't it? It's fine.

971
01:28:39,719 --> 01:28:42,656
They got everything
from Sears and Roebuck.

972
01:28:42,729 --> 01:28:46,244
I appreciate what you said
to them about me.

973
01:28:46,316 --> 01:28:49,864
Thank you, Miss Wildhack. Montana.

974
01:28:49,934 --> 01:28:52,653
Montana. You don't meet many gentlemen...

975
01:28:52,720 --> 01:28:54,827
in the entertainment
business.

976
01:28:54,898 --> 01:28:57,747
I'm an optometrist.
Oh.

977
01:28:57,811 --> 01:28:59,755
Would you like
to kiss me?

978
01:28:59,829 --> 01:29:01,685
Yes.

979
01:29:04,792 --> 01:29:06,834
You kiss nicely.

980
01:29:06,905 --> 01:29:09,591
Thank you.
Oh! Did I hurt you?

981
01:29:09,660 --> 01:29:12,509
Oh, no!
Oh!

982
01:29:14,591 --> 01:29:16,447
<i>Mr. Pilgrim?</i>

983
01:29:18,306 --> 01:29:20,162
<i>Miss Wildhack?</i>

984
01:29:22,180 --> 01:29:24,036
<i>Are you mating now?</i>

985
01:29:40,689 --> 01:29:42,730
Billy!

986
01:29:42,802 --> 01:29:45,356
Billy, look at this!

987
01:29:45,427 --> 01:29:49,172
Look at this! Perfect.
There's not a chip on it.

988
01:29:49,238 --> 01:29:52,339
It's exactly like the one we had at
home. The one your son Johnny broke?

989
01:29:52,408 --> 01:29:54,930
Yeah! How'd you
know about that?

990
01:29:55,002 --> 01:29:58,966
The letter you wrote home. Of
course. It's a miracle, isn't it?

991
01:29:59,037 --> 01:30:03,131
This little dancer survived
all this destruction.

992
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:06,715
Wait'll I bring it home. Can you
imagine how Meg's eyes will light up?

993
01:30:06,786 --> 01:30:08,576
<i>Arbeit!
She'll love it.</i>

994
01:30:08,643 --> 01:30:11,165
<i>Diener?</i>

995
01:30:11,237 --> 01:30:13,093
<i>Was haben sie da?</i>

996
01:30:13,159 --> 01:30:17,187
Oh, uh, look at this.

997
01:30:17,258 --> 01:30:20,391
I found this down there. There's not
a chip on it. It's pretty, isn't it?

998
01:30:20,460 --> 01:30:24,041
We had one like it.
Used to sit... Oh!

999
01:30:24,110 --> 01:30:28,204
What's the matter?

1000
01:30:38,552 --> 01:30:41,783
<i>Feuer!</i>

1001
01:30:43,612 --> 01:30:46,548
<i>Stop! Stop!</i>

1002
01:30:56,772 --> 01:31:00,768
Billy. Billy?
Billy?

1003
01:31:02,600 --> 01:31:04,838
Where were you, honey?

1004
01:31:08,652 --> 01:31:11,239
Billy? Do you like this?

1005
01:31:16,530 --> 01:31:19,915
- It's nice.
- It's, uh, not too tight?

1006
01:31:19,988 --> 01:31:23,602
<i>A little, maybe.</i>

1007
01:31:23,670 --> 01:31:25,427
I'm so big here.

1008
01:31:25,495 --> 01:31:28,661
I like it.

1009
01:31:28,729 --> 01:31:30,771
That's 'cause you're a man.

1010
01:31:32,157 --> 01:31:34,941
- I'm gonna have to let it out.
- I really think...

1011
01:31:35,006 --> 01:31:37,342
<i>Give me something to do.</i>

1012
01:31:39,745 --> 01:31:41,633
Oh. You like it too,
Spot. Huh?

1013
01:31:41,699 --> 01:31:44,319
He always growled
at my wife.

1014
01:31:45,541 --> 01:31:47,932
Do you miss her?

1015
01:31:51,081 --> 01:31:54,596
She died. Somebody smacked
into the rear of her car...

1016
01:31:54,667 --> 01:31:56,840
and the exhaust fell off.

1017
01:31:56,909 --> 01:31:58,885
She died of carbon monoxide
poisoning.

1018
01:31:58,958 --> 01:32:02,572
Wow. Like what
they have out there?

1019
01:32:02,641 --> 01:32:05,294
No. That's cyanide.
That's worse.

1020
01:32:05,363 --> 01:32:07,437
Oh, wow.

1021
01:32:08,725 --> 01:32:10,613
What did you love most
about her?

1022
01:32:15,993 --> 01:32:18,930
Her pancakes.

1023
01:32:20,541 --> 01:32:23,194
If we had a real stove,
Billy,

1024
01:32:23,263 --> 01:32:25,948
I'd make you an out-of-sight
macrobiotic souffl.

1025
01:32:26,016 --> 01:32:29,182
I'd like that.

1026
01:32:29,250 --> 01:32:31,707
And then...

1027
01:32:31,780 --> 01:32:34,914
we could think
about having your baby.

1028
01:32:40,330 --> 01:32:43,463
Could we have
the night canopy, please?

1029
01:32:50,641 --> 01:32:54,288
<i>Oh, Daddy! There is no such
planet as Trilaflamaduke!</i>

1030
01:32:54,356 --> 01:32:58,287
Dad, I think what Barbara and
I would really like to know...

1031
01:32:58,359 --> 01:33:00,302
Would you be willing
to see a psychiatrist?

1032
01:33:00,376 --> 01:33:03,957
Listen, I have a friend
who's not only a doctor,

1033
01:33:04,026 --> 01:33:05,750
but he's interested
in outer space.

1034
01:33:05,819 --> 01:33:08,723
Why don't the three of us
have lunch together today?

1035
01:33:08,797 --> 01:33:11,614
I'm not going to commit myself to
an institution. Dad, I wasn't...

1036
01:33:11,679 --> 01:33:15,610
If it weren't for Tralfamadore, I
might have needed an institution.

1037
01:33:17,155 --> 01:33:19,808
I don't need a doctor, Stanley.

1038
01:33:19,877 --> 01:33:21,766
On Tralfamadore you learn
that the world...

1039
01:33:21,830 --> 01:33:26,623
is just a collection of moments all
strung together in beautiful, random order.

1040
01:33:26,698 --> 01:33:30,857
And if we're going to survive, it's up to
us to concentrate on the good moments...

1041
01:33:30,924 --> 01:33:33,162
and ignore the bad.

1042
01:33:33,230 --> 01:33:34,987
Besides, I'm in love up there.

1043
01:33:35,055 --> 01:33:38,091
<i>You know, Dad, I'd really like
to have lunch with you today.</i>

1044
01:33:38,161 --> 01:33:40,814
I'll be very busy.

1045
01:33:42,292 --> 01:33:44,082
Montana's pregnant.

1046
01:33:46,551 --> 01:33:48,691
What's her name?

1047
01:33:48,761 --> 01:33:50,802
Montana Wildhack.

1048
01:33:50,874 --> 01:33:53,625
That's the Hollywood starlet
who disappeared, isn't it?

1049
01:33:53,692 --> 01:33:55,798
Oh, my God.

1050
01:33:55,869 --> 01:33:59,385
Dad! Hey, w-wait
a minute, Dad.

1051
01:33:59,456 --> 01:34:01,399
Dad, listen.

1052
01:34:01,473 --> 01:34:04,890

- If you go back and forth in time, do you go into the future too?

1053
01:34:04,963 --> 01:34:07,648
- Mm-hmm. Frequently.
- Well...

1054
01:34:07,718 --> 01:34:09,988
I mean, h-how far
do you go?

1055
01:34:10,055 --> 01:34:14,914
Do you actually go... All the way
to my death. I've seen it many times.

1056
01:34:14,986 --> 01:34:19,397
I died in Philadelphia, where I was giving
a speech on the subject ofTralfamadore.

1057
01:34:19,598 --> 01:34:24,074
You see, in Tralfamadore,
where I presently dwell,

1058
01:34:24,145 --> 01:34:26,001
life has no beginning,

1059
01:34:26,066 --> 01:34:29,778
no middle and no end.

1060
01:34:29,844 --> 01:34:31,951
For example,
many years ago...

1061
01:34:32,022 --> 01:34:35,090
a certain man promised
to have me killed.

1062
01:34:35,160 --> 01:34:39,571
He's an old man now,
living not far from here.

1063
01:34:39,643 --> 01:34:43,868
He's read all of the publicity
associated with my appearance.

1064
01:34:43,933 --> 01:34:47,351
He's insane, and tonight
he'll keep his promise.

1065
01:34:54,437 --> 01:34:56,381
If you protest,

1066
01:34:56,454 --> 01:34:59,107
if you think that death
is a terrible thing,

1067
01:34:59,176 --> 01:35:02,953
<i>then you have not understood
what I have said.</i>

1068
01:35:03,019 --> 01:35:05,191
<i>You see, it's time
for you to go home...</i>

1069
01:35:05,261 --> 01:35:08,394
<i>to your wives and children.</i>

1070
01:35:08,462 --> 01:35:12,327
<i>It's time for me to be dead
for a little while...</i>

1071
01:35:12,401 --> 01:35:14,257
and then live again.

1072
01:35:14,322 --> 01:35:18,962
I give you
the Tralfamadorian greeting:

1073
01:35:21,335 --> 01:35:24,239
"Hello. Farewell.

1074
01:35:25,818 --> 01:35:28,602
<i>"Hello.</i>

1075
01:35:28,668 --> 01:35:31,059
<i>"Farewell.</i>

1076
01:35:31,134 --> 01:35:33,623
"Eternally connected,

1077
01:35:33,695 --> 01:35:36,632
"eternally embracing.

1078
01:35:36,706 --> 01:35:39,074
"Hello.

1079
01:35:40,484 --> 01:35:42,907
Farewell. "

1080
01:35:45,575 --> 01:35:48,545
Nobody fucks around
with Paul Lazzaro!

1081
01:35:48,617 --> 01:35:51,008
<i>Do you hear me,
Pilgrim?</i>

1082
01:35:51,083 --> 01:35:53,802
<i>Pilgrim?</i>

1083
01:35:53,869 --> 01:35:56,172
<i>Pilgrim?</i>

1084
01:35:56,238 --> 01:35:58,312
<i>Hey, Pilgrim!
You hear me?</i>

1085
01:35:58,384 --> 01:36:02,894
<i>Pilgrim, get your ass over here
and give me a hand!</i>

1086
01:36:02,963 --> 01:36:06,227
What are you gonna do with
that? I'm gonna make a fortune!

1087
01:36:06,294 --> 01:36:08,150
Are you kidding?

1088
01:36:08,215 --> 01:36:10,999
Haven't you got enough
stuff? What if we get caught?

1089
01:36:11,065 --> 01:36:13,455
We ain't gonna get caught.
The Krauts have all left.

1090
01:36:13,530 --> 01:36:16,948
<i>If we don't steal it,
the Russians will.</i>

1091
01:36:17,020 --> 01:36:20,186
Let's get the fuck outta here! Wait!

1092
01:36:20,255 --> 01:36:23,071
Wait! Wait!
Wait! Wait!

1093
01:36:31,495 --> 01:36:33,635
I surrender!
I surrender!

1094
01:36:33,704 --> 01:36:37,121
I surrender!

1095
01:36:37,194 --> 01:36:39,050
I surrender!

1096
01:36:46,289 --> 01:36:48,909
I don't know.

1097
01:37:07,167 --> 01:37:10,071
<i>Billy? Billy?</i>

1098
01:37:10,145 --> 01:37:11,968
<i>Wejust had a baby!</i>

1099
01:37:17,510 --> 01:37:21,823
Billy. We've just had
a baby boy!

1100
01:37:21,896 --> 01:37:23,905
Look at him!

1101
01:37:23,978 --> 01:37:26,085
Isn't he beautiful?

1102
01:37:26,156 --> 01:37:28,808
Ahh. Yes. Isn't he incredibly beautiful?

1103
01:37:28,877 --> 01:37:31,181
He's perfect.
Every bit of him.

1104
01:37:33,264 --> 01:37:36,233
What shall we call him?
Billy, of course.

1105
01:37:36,306 --> 01:37:39,953
Anyway, even if he doesn't look too
much like you, he's got your name.

1106
01:37:40,021 --> 01:37:42,095
Hello.

1107
01:37:42,166 --> 01:37:45,299
Are you hungry? I think
he's hungry now. Mm-hmm.

1108
01:37:45,369 --> 01:37:49,146
You hungry? Huh?
Here. There it is.

1109
01:37:49,211 --> 01:37:51,482
Take it, take it.
Ouch!

1110
01:37:51,549 --> 01:37:54,169
Oh. Ah.
