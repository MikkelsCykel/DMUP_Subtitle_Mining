1
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:06,574
This is Evan Scabetta.

2
00:00:06,648 --> 00:00:11,585
I'm calling from Non-bottled Wine
Beverage Monthly, a new publication.

3
00:00:11,653 --> 00:00:14,213
I was just calling to inform you...

4
00:00:14,289 --> 00:00:19,022
that your product has been selected
as the best boxed wine on the market.

5
00:00:19,093 --> 00:00:21,823
That's right, so all of us
here at the magazine thought...

6
00:00:21,896 --> 00:00:26,299
you should go ahead and send over
a fuckin' shitload of it.

7
00:00:26,367 --> 00:00:28,733
Oh, we love it.
It's o good.

8
00:00:28,803 --> 00:00:31,067
- We like--
- Merlot.

9
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,274
We love the merlot.

10
00:00:34,342 --> 00:00:38,108
You're the best, Rita.
You always have been. Thank you.

11
00:00:38,179 --> 00:00:41,774
Allright, boys. We've done this before.
Let's do it again.

12
00:00:41,849 --> 00:00:45,785
Simple, easy, by the book.

13
00:00:45,853 --> 00:00:48,151
Meet back here in 20 minutes.

14
00:01:37,905 --> 00:01:40,237
Holden University.

15
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:42,538
This was our territory...

16
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:46,011
andh ere we were,
48 days away from a diploma...

17
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:49,015
that would open doors
for the rest of our lives.

18
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:52,348
We're one step closer
to the American dream.

19
00:01:53,588 --> 00:01:55,783
After today'ss cam.

20
00:02:35,963 --> 00:02:38,898
Hey there! Mission Sports!
Everybody smile for the camera!

21
00:02:38,966 --> 00:02:41,127
It's gonna be on tonight at 8:00.
Everybody smile!

22
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:44,501
Mission Sports
2-2 Bureau Sports Channel.

23
00:02:44,572 --> 00:02:47,336
One camera,
24-hour-a-day sports coverage.

24
00:02:47,408 --> 00:02:50,172
Yeah! Slow down. Slow down.

25
00:02:50,244 --> 00:02:52,576
You guys wanna be on TV?
Say hello to Mom!

26
00:03:15,336 --> 00:03:18,328
We're on 'em, we're on 'em.
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.

27
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:22,365
You're great. You look good.
Big strides. Smile for the camera.

28
00:03:40,561 --> 00:03:42,495
No athletics like amateur athletics.

29
00:03:42,563 --> 00:03:45,862
I see the Olympics for you, baby.
Everybody's a winner.

30
00:04:01,582 --> 00:04:03,447
Right here, right here!

31
00:04:04,952 --> 00:04:06,419
All runners cross the street!

32
00:04:18,099 --> 00:04:20,226
This way, this way, this way!

33
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:22,394
This is a different route.

34
00:04:34,448 --> 00:04:36,939
Beautiful! All right!
You're looking good!

35
00:04:49,964 --> 00:04:53,400
New route! This way!
Let's see the form! Big smiles!

36
00:04:53,467 --> 00:04:56,959
Everybody cross the street!
All runners cross the street!

37
00:04:57,038 --> 00:04:59,131
New route!

38
00:04:59,207 --> 00:05:01,732
- Watch where you're going, asshole!
- Oh, yeah.

39
00:05:13,154 --> 00:05:15,088
- My leg!
- I can't believe it!

40
00:05:15,156 --> 00:05:18,387
- Oh! You killed my tibia!
- Oh, my God.

41
00:05:18,459 --> 00:05:21,257
- What a travesty!
- Oh, Lord!

42
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:23,263
Jesus, this looks bad.

43
00:05:23,331 --> 00:05:27,563
He's never gonna make it. He's supposed
to work in a kibbutz this summer.

44
00:05:27,635 --> 00:05:31,162
- Whatever, but I didn't do anything.
- Have mercy on my leg!

45
00:05:31,239 --> 00:05:34,333
Keep lyin, buddy. We got it on tape.
I might just call that number.

46
00:05:34,408 --> 00:05:36,842
- I'm calling my supervisor.
- Call a doctor while you're at it.

47
00:05:36,911 --> 00:05:41,007
- Hey, I was in Desert Storm, mister!
- God, it hurts!

48
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,143
-Allofthis...
- You don't know anything about driving.

49
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:48,154
- topassa test.
- He broke my tibia!

50
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:50,656
He broke my tibia!

51
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:54,286
It's one ofour favorit scams--
the worm in the apple.

52
00:05:57,365 --> 00:05:59,697
which they kept under lock and key.

53
00:05:59,767 --> 00:06:02,031
Now, if you had an extra blue book...

54
00:06:02,103 --> 00:06:04,264
you could pretty much
get away with anything.

55
00:06:04,338 --> 00:06:08,570
And now, after this morning,
we had our very own supply.

56
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:12,379
Okay, people, this is the midterm.

57
00:06:12,446 --> 00:06:14,880
It is 30 percent of your grade.

58
00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:17,144
Now's the time to start panicking.

59
00:06:17,218 --> 00:06:20,654
For those ofyou who don't know me,
my name is Philip, I'm the head TA.

60
00:06:20,721 --> 00:06:23,713
If you don't know me,
that means you've never been to class.

61
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:26,817
Study materials
need to go under our desk...

62
00:06:26,894 --> 00:06:29,158
as my minions pass out
the test booklets.

63
00:06:29,897 --> 00:06:32,161
Game time. Let me get some booklets.
We need three.

64
00:06:32,233 --> 00:06:35,066
That means our textbooks
go under-- Exactly!

65
00:06:35,136 --> 00:06:37,070
It's not open book.

66
00:06:37,138 --> 00:06:39,436
We leftjunior high a long time ago.

67
00:06:41,876 --> 00:06:43,810
Don'tmake eye contact.

68
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,676
And our midterm...

69
00:06:47,748 --> 00:06:49,682
begins now.

70
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,685
I gotta take a test.
I gotta take a test.

71
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:57,389
Hi there.

72
00:07:01,228 --> 00:07:03,093
You're in my seat.

73
00:07:03,164 --> 00:07:05,428
- The seat was empty.
- I was getting test booklets.

74
00:07:05,499 --> 00:07:07,933
- Get out ofmy seat.
- We already have test booklets.

75
00:07:08,002 --> 00:07:10,937
Hi. Hello. Yeah.
See, the test booklets are out.

76
00:07:11,005 --> 00:07:13,530
So this conversation you're having
isn't taking place.

77
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:18,044
- He's in my seat, though.
- Exactly.

78
00:07:18,112 --> 00:07:21,604
And we're grownups, so we don't argue
over seats. Why don't we go over there.

79
00:07:24,952 --> 00:07:26,886
You just made my little black book.

80
00:07:28,422 --> 00:07:30,788
Okay, go sit. Go sit.

81
00:07:36,964 --> 00:07:39,228
Move, move, move.
You're late now. Move.

82
00:07:43,537 --> 00:07:46,062
- I'm sorry. Do you know him?
- No.

83
00:07:47,775 --> 00:07:49,970
- Good. Thank you.
- Eyes on my own paper.

84
00:07:50,945 --> 00:07:53,209
Joe Schmo has no answers for you.

85
00:07:54,382 --> 00:07:56,976
Man, this is a really hard test.
 
86
00:07:57,718 --> 00:07:59,879
I don't think I know
one of these damn answers.

87
00:07:59,954 --> 00:08:02,821
Good thing I'm not in this class.

88
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:05,358
See, I'm simply here
to copy the questions down.

89
00:08:09,663 --> 00:08:12,791
Look at me.
I'm ananonymous blender-inner.

90
00:08:18,172 --> 00:08:20,106
make the switch.

91
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:25,206
I leave the stolen bluebook
as a decoy.

92
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:28,442
And here?
Here's where I made my mistake.

93
00:08:28,516 --> 00:08:30,575
This is how it all started.

94
00:08:32,019 --> 00:08:34,351
But, I mean, look at her.

95
00:08:34,422 --> 00:08:37,357
That's the reason
I went to college.

96
00:08:41,762 --> 00:08:45,960
I wrote my number down in case you
wanna call me to talk about the test.

97
00:08:47,034 --> 00:08:48,934
Or just talk about anything.

98
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:53,604
I gotta go. Here's my number.
I want you to call me.

99
00:08:53,674 --> 00:08:56,609
You know, tell me
how the rest of the test went.

100
00:08:56,677 --> 00:08:59,111
- You know?
- Okay.

101
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,141
Just call me.

102
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:11,991
- I have to go to the bathroom.
- That's not allowed during the test.

103
00:09:12,059 --> 00:09:13,492
I really have to go.

104
00:09:14,462 --> 00:09:15,724
Tell you what.

105
00:09:20,835 --> 00:09:22,200
Explosive diarrhea.

106
00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:25,636
Okay, go. All right.
And leave that stuff there.

107
00:09:28,342 --> 00:09:30,708
Good luck.
I mean that.

108
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,809
What you just saw was cheating.

109
00:09:34,882 --> 00:09:38,818
Now I've got the questions, and
all my roommate needs are the answers.

110
00:09:38,886 --> 00:09:40,683
I just don't wanna get sloppy 600s.

111
00:09:41,288 --> 00:09:42,687
I told you,Jeff...

112
00:09:42,756 --> 00:09:47,216
you gotta work through gay porn
before they let you set foot in hetero.

113
00:09:47,294 --> 00:09:48,818
- Fellas.
- Really?

114
00:09:48,896 --> 00:09:52,263
Dave, is this true? You have to do gay
porn before you work in straight porn?

115
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:55,598
- True.
- What a dirty, despicable business.

116
00:09:55,669 --> 00:09:57,330
- How'd it go?
- It went well.

117
00:09:57,404 --> 00:10:00,100
I slipped in, I slipped out.
It was beautiful.

118
00:10:02,176 --> 00:10:04,610
- I was fuckin' invisible. Relax.
- You're sure?

119
00:10:04,678 --> 00:10:05,940
Yeah, I was invisible.

120
00:10:06,013 --> 00:10:10,746
Guys, this is like child's play.
A baby could do this work.

121
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:12,342
Don't get flashy, Karl.

122
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:14,717
Nothing higher than an A-minus,
or we dock you.

123
00:10:14,788 --> 00:10:17,188
Look, I'm just saying--

124
00:10:17,258 --> 00:10:21,752
We pay you because you do phenomenal
work, so fill out that physics test.

125
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:24,764
Maybe you wouldn't need someone
to fill out every test form...

126
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:28,359
if you stopped smoking these doobies,
smack joint heads.

127
00:10:28,435 --> 00:10:31,700
Don't be so smug, Karl.
There's a lot here you don't know about.

128
00:10:33,707 --> 00:10:36,301
No. That does not agree with me.

129
00:10:38,312 --> 00:10:41,804
Okay, harumph, it's over--
I saw that.

130
00:10:41,882 --> 00:10:44,407
Flip me off one more time,
I'm taking away the test.

131
00:10:44,485 --> 00:10:49,047
Pass 'em toyour left.
To your left!

132
00:10:49,123 --> 00:10:51,057
Quickly.

133
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:54,219
And you may leave.
I don't wanna see you anymore.

134
00:10:55,796 --> 00:10:57,730
Enjoy your vacation.

135
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:18,484
Okay, the test is over.
We're done here.

136
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:41,166
- So, how'd you do on the test?
- Oh, who knows?

137
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:45,008
- What, you don't care?
- I'm obsessing about this purity test.

138
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,741
- It's a magazine.
- I missed skank by two points.

139
00:11:47,815 --> 00:11:51,376
I don't think you have to
worry about that.

140
00:11:51,452 --> 00:11:52,817
Hey, hot boy.

141
00:11:52,886 --> 00:11:56,447
I thought that was your sexy ass.
Come here.

142
00:11:56,523 --> 00:11:58,957
Ooh, you guys are so fuckin' hot.

143
00:11:59,026 --> 00:12:01,460
- Give me some of that.
- Some of this?

144
00:12:04,732 --> 00:12:08,168
I was right.
You're a hard person to follow.

145
00:12:08,235 --> 00:12:12,365
I'm sorry, I don't think that
we've met before. I'm Angela.

146
00:12:13,407 --> 00:12:14,704
You like me?

147
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:16,709
We just took a test together.

148
00:12:20,481 --> 00:12:23,416
You guys must've been in a zone
when you were taking that test.

149
00:12:23,484 --> 00:12:25,884
- We sat right next to each other.
- Hey, what's going on?

150
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:27,648
How you guys doin'?

151
00:12:27,721 --> 00:12:29,655
- We're fine.
- Are you having a good day?

152
00:12:29,723 --> 00:12:30,655
- Yeah.
- Cool.

153
00:12:30,724 --> 00:12:33,750
You guys know where
Professor Markoe's office is?

154
00:12:35,529 --> 00:12:37,963
Yeah, Professor Markoe's office?

155
00:12:39,433 --> 00:12:41,458
I think it's
right the "F" over there.

156
00:12:41,535 --> 00:12:43,969
Can you see I'm having
a goddamn conversation?

157
00:12:44,038 --> 00:12:46,768
Just back off
and go do your stupid-ass thing.

158
00:12:49,843 --> 00:12:54,075
The factis, the midterm
has already been, and you missed it.

159
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,672
You guys mustnot
have heard me.

160
00:12:55,949 --> 00:12:59,510
I'm Sam Schechter.
I got hit by a truck today.

161
00:12:59,586 --> 00:13:01,520
I heard all of that.

162
00:13:01,588 --> 00:13:05,285
- What the heck is going on?
- Professor Markoe, thank God.

163
00:13:05,359 --> 00:13:08,294
Listen, I got hit by a truck today.

164
00:13:08,362 --> 00:13:10,626
All I want is to take the midterm.

165
00:13:10,698 --> 00:13:13,758
Hit by a truck?
Are you okay?

166
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,927
He got hit by a truck!

167
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,937
Okay, but is he all right?

168
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:22,533
I got hit by a truck.
I got a busted tibia.

169
00:13:23,644 --> 00:13:25,578
My rib cage is very tender.

170
00:13:27,147 --> 00:13:28,808
My testicle turned blue.

171
00:13:28,882 --> 00:13:33,581
Why don't you drop your trousers
and we'll examine 'em.

172
00:13:34,321 --> 00:13:38,553
The color of your balls won't change
the fact that you missed the midterm.

173
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:42,288
If it'll help me take the midterm,
I'm happy to show everyone my balls.

174
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:44,058
We don't wanna see that.

175
00:13:44,131 --> 00:13:46,463
Forget about looking at the balls.

176
00:13:46,533 --> 00:13:48,865
You're gonna take the midterm.

177
00:13:48,936 --> 00:13:52,497
And you are gonna let him
take it at your desk.

178
00:13:52,573 --> 00:13:55,565
-You'll have to move until he's through.
-I gotta take it somewhere.

179
00:13:55,642 --> 00:13:59,806
And I want you to give him
all the time he needs.

180
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,438
Good luck, kid.

181
00:14:03,584 --> 00:14:05,518
I'm tellin' you...

182
00:14:05,586 --> 00:14:07,520
tell that motherfucker to go.

183
00:14:07,588 --> 00:14:11,080
He is no damn good.
I bet he got crabs.

184
00:14:12,826 --> 00:14:16,193
Yeah, girl.
Put on my hot boots, get my groove on.

185
00:14:17,264 --> 00:14:18,856
- Yeah.
- Well, I'm finished.

186
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:22,994
Think I did pretty good.

187
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:25,997
Shotgun.

188
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:31,010
Boys, to a very successful operation.
Possibly one ofour last.

189
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:33,603
Which I masterminded, by the way.

190
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,012
We'll give you that.

191
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:39,849
It's not too soon, I say.
I think the well's sorta run dry.

192
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,854
Let's get the heck outta here.

193
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:43,856
- You're ready to go to law school?
- Absolutely.

194
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:47,655
Jeff's gonna get out too. He's gonna be
a financial master of the universe.

195
00:14:47,728 --> 00:14:50,959
- That'll help me get some fine bitches.
- It's time to move on, man.

196
00:14:51,031 --> 00:14:53,556
What do you have that's
better than this? This is great.

197
00:14:53,634 --> 00:14:55,568
This is great?
This is a shit heap.

198
00:14:55,636 --> 00:14:59,072
I gotta be honest. Best dorm on campus
doesn't excite me much anymore.

199
00:14:59,139 --> 00:15:03,041
Areyou kidding? It took four years to
build this place. This place is great.

200
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:06,409
You seem scared to move on 'cause you
don't know what to do with your life.

201
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,540
-It's okay if you're afraid to graduate.
-If you're afraid of the future.

202
00:15:09,616 --> 00:15:14,315
You know what? This is going nowhere.
Let's just celebrate our latest win.

203
00:15:14,388 --> 00:15:16,982
- Celebrate how?
- The usual way, of course.

204
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,970
The usual way.

205
00:16:09,042 --> 00:16:10,475
Lenny's.

206
00:16:10,544 --> 00:16:12,808
I'll get the birthday club cards.

207
00:16:15,782 --> 00:16:17,716
I say "happy,"
you say "birthday."

208
00:16:17,784 --> 00:16:18,808
- Happy.
- Birthday!

209
00:16:19,686 --> 00:16:21,381
When I say "birthday,"
you say "party." Birthday.

210
00:16:21,455 --> 00:16:22,319
Party!

211
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:25,986
- Let's say it. Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday!

212
00:16:26,059 --> 00:16:28,823
- Let's party...
- Hearty!

213
00:16:29,796 --> 00:16:30,888
Party hearty.

214
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:34,466
Here's to an A-minus, boys,
in physics.

215
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:37,333
- The easy way.
- That's right.

216
00:16:37,404 --> 00:16:40,498
That's Sam.
Sam cheats for convenience.

217
00:16:40,574 --> 00:16:43,509
At this school, if you can't
pass a foreign language exam...

218
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,781
on the otherside of campus.

219
00:16:51,718 --> 00:16:53,777
and never plans to.

220
00:16:53,854 --> 00:16:57,187
The classroom is being threatened
by fire. Run from this inferno.

221
00:16:57,257 --> 00:17:00,818
Quickly, quickly! Everyone!
You, last student, turn!

222
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:03,124
Good God, man,
what is wrong with you?

223
00:17:03,196 --> 00:17:05,630
You want to end up
like burnt breakfast toast?

224
00:17:09,603 --> 00:17:11,594
Your sacrifice puzzles and honors me.

225
00:17:11,672 --> 00:17:14,800
I must leave now. I am a coward.
Do not tell anyone.

226
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:18,003
It was Sam's idea toj oin forces.

227
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:20,012
Alone we werej ust a couple
of freshman cheaters...

228
00:17:20,714 --> 00:17:24,275
but together we were dangerous.

229
00:17:24,351 --> 00:17:26,842
I'm not an evil, lying genius.

230
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,981
I just happen to know a technique.
I callit "The Seed of Doubt. "

231
00:17:31,058 --> 00:17:32,719
I'm a commercial
airline pilot.

232
00:17:32,793 --> 00:17:36,559
Say it, repeat it, believe it.

233
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:37,562
Yeah, whatever.

234
00:17:37,631 --> 00:17:39,861
No, no,
I'm a commercial airline pilot.

235
00:17:43,704 --> 00:17:46,138
I, ladies...

236
00:17:46,206 --> 00:17:49,175
am a professional, commercial...

237
00:17:49,242 --> 00:17:52,234
airline pilot.

238
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,480
- Cool!
- Yeah.

239
00:17:55,549 --> 00:17:56,846
Is he a pilot too?

240
00:17:56,917 --> 00:17:58,748
F.B.I.

241
00:17:58,819 --> 00:18:00,116
I got the ugly one.

242
00:18:00,187 --> 00:18:04,089
Jeff bought in sophomore year.
He marches to a different drummer.

243
00:18:06,793 --> 00:18:09,023
He's just crazy.

244
00:18:09,096 --> 00:18:13,430
I don't want you to worry about
finishing the exam. No one ever does.

245
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,936
That's the way I designed it,
so just finish writing whenever you--

246
00:18:17,004 --> 00:18:21,031
Time's up! Okay, that's it. Time's up.
Close your books, stop writing.

247
00:18:21,808 --> 00:18:23,867
Come forward with your papers
immediately.

248
00:18:23,944 --> 00:18:25,935
Everybody in the back.

249
00:18:26,013 --> 00:18:28,447
Everybody all the way in the back.

250
00:18:28,515 --> 00:18:30,506
You. Yes, you.

251
00:18:30,584 --> 00:18:33,052
Little Red Riding Hood.
Congratulations.

252
00:18:34,054 --> 00:18:36,284
You just got an "F."
Come on up.

253
00:18:36,356 --> 00:18:39,382
There's always one in every crowd
who doesn't believe me.

254
00:18:39,459 --> 00:18:42,394
You can stop writing, sir. I don't care
if you have the cure for cancer.

255
00:18:42,462 --> 00:18:44,453
It's fruitless.
You will not pass.

256
00:18:45,866 --> 00:18:48,357
Sir, congratulations.
You have failed.

257
00:18:48,435 --> 00:18:51,768
- Do you even know my name?
- No, I don't knowyour name.

258
00:18:51,838 --> 00:18:53,806
No, you don't.

259
00:19:02,082 --> 00:19:04,550
What's your name?
What's your name?

260
00:19:04,618 --> 00:19:07,553
I've seen a lot of pornos in my day.
It's like a trade secret.

261
00:19:07,621 --> 00:19:09,612
Next time you're jackin' off,
you sit lndian style.

262
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,625
Believe what you want.
At least I get out some.

263
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:15,662
You go through more tissues
than a widow.

264
00:19:15,729 --> 00:19:17,128
What? It's true.

265
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:20,428
Who's the one who just said
I've seen a lot of porn?

266
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:24,630
You are a rabid consumer of porn.
They have your name on file.

267
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:27,970
You're the one who masturbates.
I'm not the--

268
00:19:28,675 --> 00:19:30,768
Happy birthday or whatever.

269
00:19:31,812 --> 00:19:32,972
What's up?

270
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:36,447
How'd you do on the test?

271
00:19:36,516 --> 00:19:38,746
Well, I fucked up
the gravitational constant.

272
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,447
Me too.

273
00:19:41,521 --> 00:19:43,455
What's your name again?

274
00:19:45,826 --> 00:19:47,919
Tom Weaver.

275
00:19:47,994 --> 00:19:50,827
Can we help you
with something, guy?

276
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:54,166
Oh, my God, how's your leg?

277
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:58,432
Obviously he's a lot better now.
Thanks for your concern.

278
00:19:58,505 --> 00:20:01,963
And if you're done
trying to hide the baloney pony...

279
00:20:02,042 --> 00:20:03,976
we've got some stuff to eat.

280
00:20:08,548 --> 00:20:10,539
Happy birthday.

281
00:20:10,617 --> 00:20:12,482
Yeah, dude.
Happy birthday, man.

282
00:20:12,552 --> 00:20:14,679
- Third one this week.
- I'm proud of you.

283
00:20:17,858 --> 00:20:20,326
- Who is that guy?
- He's just a bus boy.

284
00:20:42,082 --> 00:20:44,073
Gimme seven!

285
00:20:44,151 --> 00:20:47,484
Hey, you guys are about to
enter into a world of pain.

286
00:20:47,554 --> 00:20:50,717
You. I know what you did.
I was there. I saw it.

287
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:54,158
- Move, or you're gonna get hurt.
- It's that tweaked bus boy, man.

288
00:20:54,227 --> 00:20:57,458
I know what you did. I was sitting
right next to you. Remember me?

289
00:20:57,531 --> 00:21:00,466
Hey, shorty.
How's your leg feeling, buddy?

290
00:21:00,534 --> 00:21:03,401
You're playing awfully good
for having a broken leg.

291
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:06,906
Right, homeboy?
I'm not kiddin' around, bitch.

292
00:21:12,279 --> 00:21:15,578
Okay, let's see
the so-called proof.

293
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:20,848
I got the proof. You were there, Dave.
Dave Goodman, 555-01 22.

294
00:21:20,921 --> 00:21:22,786
This is nothin'.

295
00:21:22,856 --> 00:21:24,756
Keep it.
I got plenty of copies.

296
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:28,761
Of course, if this were to get out,
you guys would probably be expelled.

297
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:31,923
Do you really need a diploma? No.

298
00:21:31,998 --> 00:21:35,934
But, you know, if you wanted
to go to a law school, for instance...

299
00:21:36,002 --> 00:21:37,936
that'd be pretty tough.

300
00:21:38,004 --> 00:21:42,805
Or be hired by a prestigious financial
firm like Stockton, Upright & Falk.

301
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:45,537
I'm into that firm.

302
00:21:45,612 --> 00:21:47,273
I know. I saw your name
on the interview list.

303
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:50,578
Good luck getting that job.
They don't hire cheaters.

304
00:21:52,285 --> 00:21:54,617
Hey, wait!
Ethan, wait. Dave.

305
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:55,780
Dave, come on.

306
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:59,121
Okay. What do you want?

307
00:22:02,095 --> 00:22:03,585
I got a proposition for you.

308
00:22:03,663 --> 00:22:06,097
You're obviously amoral...

309
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:08,327
but certainly clever in your ways.

310
00:22:08,401 --> 00:22:11,165
And you, you may have some...

311
00:22:12,239 --> 00:22:14,673
people skills I may lack.

312
00:22:14,741 --> 00:22:17,505
What do you want? Money?
Free dry cleaning? Euro-pass?

313
00:22:17,577 --> 00:22:20,068
No, I don't--
A Euro-pass? No. No!

314
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:24,476
I want you to get me a girl.

315
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:26,849
- A girl.
- This is college!

316
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,979
Bag your own bitches.

317
00:22:29,055 --> 00:22:31,080
Angela's not a bitch!

318
00:22:33,493 --> 00:22:35,427
Take it easy, man!

319
00:22:36,296 --> 00:22:38,491
Let him go.
You gonna be good?

320
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:41,159
- Yes. Yes. Yes.
- Okay. Back away.

321
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:42,667
I have copies.

322
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:46,502
- I'm not afraid to expel you.
- Take it easy. Relax.

323
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:48,768
Give me a day.
I need to think about this.

324
00:22:48,842 --> 00:22:51,436
This is a tough one.
Just give us the night.

325
00:22:55,382 --> 00:22:58,681
They call me Cool Ethan.
I live in Heineraker Hall.

326
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,720
All right, cool.
We'll find you.

327
00:23:00,787 --> 00:23:02,448
All right?

328
00:23:06,693 --> 00:23:10,129
I didn't like being blackmailed
by "Cool Ethan"...

329
00:23:10,196 --> 00:23:12,630
but he did have good taste in women.

330
00:23:12,699 --> 00:23:16,863
Are you fucking insane?
This is a major breach of security.

331
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:19,633
This guy could have us
kicked out of college, man.

332
00:23:19,706 --> 00:23:22,140
Look, we will get him the girl.

333
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:24,301
Look, let me explain something to you.

334
00:23:24,377 --> 00:23:27,312
My college career
is a house of cards...

335
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:31,316
glued together with thousands of lies,
and now it's being threatened...

336
00:23:31,384 --> 00:23:33,682
- Shut up!
- by some schoolboy with a crush?

337
00:23:33,753 --> 00:23:35,687
We'll get him the girl.
Relax.

338
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:39,551
I've been watching you
everywhere you go.

339
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:42,561
Soon you're gonna be mine, aren't you?

340
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:45,996
Who's that? That's the most
beautiful girl in the world.

341
00:23:46,066 --> 00:23:48,000
I like you.

342
00:23:48,068 --> 00:23:50,832
Everything here,
you touched it, baby.

343
00:23:50,904 --> 00:23:55,341
We're gonna get married one day
and have 23 little kiddies.

344
00:23:55,408 --> 00:23:57,672
And I'm gonna get ajob
at Stockton, Upright & Falk...

345
00:23:57,744 --> 00:23:59,905
and be so rich that you're
gonna love me forever.

346
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,847
And we're gonna have sex
in my bedroom

347
00:24:08,088 --> 00:24:11,524
Guys, we're a team. Back me up.
What do you say, huh?

348
00:24:13,093 --> 00:24:16,256
Just promise me
this has nothing to do with the girl.

349
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:19,594
Hey, this has nothing
to do with the girl.

350
00:24:22,035 --> 00:24:25,232
Don'tyou fuckin'
"Seed of Doubt" us, man.

351
00:24:25,305 --> 00:24:27,466
This has nothing...

352
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,940
to do...

353
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,308
with the girl.

354
00:24:37,384 --> 00:24:39,318
Okay. I'll buy it.

355
00:24:39,386 --> 00:24:43,220
Thanks.Jeff, I got a job for you.
You'll start tomorrow.

356
00:24:43,289 --> 00:24:46,383
- Sam, come on. I know you're in.
- Fuck.

357
00:24:49,662 --> 00:24:51,596
Yo, wake up.

358
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,735
- I brought you coffee.
- I don't touch that stuff.

359
00:24:56,803 --> 00:24:58,464
- Can I come in?
- No.

360
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:01,803
No one comes into Ethan's room.
Ethan's rules.

361
00:25:04,677 --> 00:25:06,110
What's that smell?

362
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:09,842
Maybe it's the smell of your ass
getting kicked out of school.

363
00:25:09,916 --> 00:25:11,850
Well, enough of this gay banter.

364
00:25:11,918 --> 00:25:13,977
- We're gonna get you the girl.
- On what day?

365
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:16,488
Well, let's say on Monday.

366
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:18,922
- Tuesdays are better.
- Tuesdays--

367
00:25:18,992 --> 00:25:20,983
- It'll be a Tuesday.
- Great.

368
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:23,086
You're smart.
I like you.

369
00:25:23,163 --> 00:25:25,097
I'll probably give you a nickname.

370
00:25:29,235 --> 00:25:32,671
We needed a plan to get into
Angela's room, so Jeff knocked.

371
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:37,543
Yoo-hoo! It's Steve Pasternak
looking for Angela.

372
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:39,771
- Angela, please.
- Do I fuckin' know you?

373
00:25:39,846 --> 00:25:43,179
I lent Angela my notebook because
I take such "world-famous" notes.

374
00:25:43,249 --> 00:25:45,274
So I was wondering if I could--

375
00:25:45,351 --> 00:25:47,319
Are you busy with something?

376
00:25:47,387 --> 00:25:50,515
Yeah. I was masturbating.

377
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:55,027
Masturbating.
In the dorms.

378
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:58,656
Well, that's what you get
when you go to art school.

379
00:25:58,731 --> 00:26:01,791
What do you want, her room?
Right over there.

380
00:26:02,969 --> 00:26:06,461
- Thank you.
- Don't touch anything.

381
00:26:08,174 --> 00:26:11,075
So, do you know
what the book looks like?

382
00:26:11,144 --> 00:26:14,545
Let me tell you what it looks like.
It's a very distinctive note--

383
00:26:15,548 --> 00:26:17,539
Some of my notebook
had her handwriting in it.

384
00:26:32,065 --> 00:26:36,001
There's really nothing here.
Someone's going to have to make contact.

385
00:26:36,069 --> 00:26:38,003
I will break, I will enter...

386
00:26:38,071 --> 00:26:40,665
I will torch, I will shatter,
I will rifle...

387
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,674
I will pillage, I will probe...

388
00:26:42,742 --> 00:26:46,178
but I'm really not comfortable
just talking to a girl.

389
00:26:46,246 --> 00:26:48,180
You know what, boys?

390
00:26:48,248 --> 00:26:51,183
Why don'tyoujust
let me take care ofit?

391
00:26:51,251 --> 00:26:55,688
You treat a hot girl like dirt
and she'll stick to you like mud.

392
00:27:02,128 --> 00:27:05,256
Watch where you're going,
you skanky-ass bitch.

393
00:27:05,331 --> 00:27:07,026
- Cocksucker.
- Slut.

394
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,034
- Butt-wipe.
- Ho.

395
00:27:09,102 --> 00:27:10,797
Monkey boy.

396
00:27:18,311 --> 00:27:21,405
Maybe I should make the contact.
What do you think?

397
00:27:21,481 --> 00:27:22,607
Sam?

398
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:28,621
Swirling gases growing
hotter and hotter...

399
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:31,782
until it reaches
a critical temperature...

400
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:35,555
and transforms itself into
the most awesome sight in the universe.

401
00:27:35,628 --> 00:27:38,563
What is this sight called?
Anybody?

402
00:27:42,902 --> 00:27:45,803
Remember me? Dave.
I'm a friend of Ethan's.

403
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:47,806
- We're in the middle of class.
- You know. Cool Ethan.

404
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:52,777
Here.
These are for you. Hey.

405
00:27:52,845 --> 00:27:56,178
Look at the matches.
He's in the inside.

406
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:01,850
- That's Cool Ethan.
- I don't know who Ethan is.

407
00:28:01,921 --> 00:28:03,786
You don't know
who Cool Ethan is?

408
00:28:03,856 --> 00:28:06,154
You, our new friend
with the pipe.

409
00:28:08,261 --> 00:28:10,161
What's the formula
for finding critical mass?

410
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,697
Keep 'em.

411
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:17,502
True.

412
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:26,443
- I don't know, man.
- Hello, dark angel.

413
00:28:26,512 --> 00:28:29,276
Fuckin' dinner on a budget.

414
00:28:29,349 --> 00:28:30,441
What'd you guys get?

415
00:28:31,684 --> 00:28:35,142
I got some term papers, some E-mails
and this "dream guy" survey.

416
00:28:35,221 --> 00:28:38,281
- I don't know what it means.
- This shit is cheesier.

417
00:28:38,358 --> 00:28:40,292
You're right.

418
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:44,057
Dream guy, huh? "Intelligent,
good-looking, smart, funny."

419
00:28:45,131 --> 00:28:47,156
Sam, where'd you say she was from?

420
00:28:47,233 --> 00:28:48,860
She's a local.

421
00:28:49,969 --> 00:28:53,405
A local, huh? Looks like I'm gonna be
making a visit to the Patton's house.

422
00:28:57,877 --> 00:28:59,606
- Charles Patton?
- Yes.

423
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:01,442
Ron Mathius, US Census Bureau.

424
00:29:01,514 --> 00:29:03,414
You've been selected for
a personal information session.

425
00:29:03,483 --> 00:29:06,247
- Is that bad?
- No, that's good, sir.

426
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:10,221
- Aren't you young for government work?
- I'm not a GS-11 yet, no.

427
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,884
- I'm just a GS-4, but--
- GS-4!

428
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:14,893
- Shall we do it?
- Let's get it on.

429
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:17,429
- All right, then.
- Come in.

430
00:29:17,497 --> 00:29:19,931
We at the Census Bureau
like to dig a little deeper...

431
00:29:19,999 --> 00:29:22,524
find out the stuff thatjust
doesn't translate to paper--

432
00:29:22,602 --> 00:29:24,536
Wow! What a beautiful home.

433
00:29:24,604 --> 00:29:27,038
Well, then, you should
meet the decorator.

434
00:29:27,106 --> 00:29:30,132
Ron Mathius, Census Bureau,
my wife Valerie.

435
00:29:33,613 --> 00:29:36,309
- Great job. Yeah.
- Oh, thankyou.

436
00:29:36,382 --> 00:29:38,077
- Would you like a drink?
- Yes!

437
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:40,085
Well, you're gonna get a drink.

438
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:42,280
That's adorable.

439
00:29:43,089 --> 00:29:45,956
- This is your only female dependent?
- Yes.

440
00:29:46,025 --> 00:29:49,461
In that case, I'm gonna need
a passport, a birth certificate...

441
00:29:49,529 --> 00:29:53,625
social security number, diary,
vaccination reports and...

442
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,395
that pretty much wraps it up.

443
00:29:55,468 --> 00:29:59,302
- Okay, let me go see what I can find.
- That would be a really big help.

444
00:30:00,206 --> 00:30:01,639
Wonderful. Super.

445
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:04,776
He really is a sweet man.

446
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:06,778
- He's a sweetheart.
- Yeah.

447
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:08,780
He's great.

448
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:11,282
This is a very lovely house
you have here.

449
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:12,682
- Oh, thankyou.
- You're welcome.

450
00:30:12,752 --> 00:30:14,879
- I like to decorate.
- I can see that.

451
00:30:14,954 --> 00:30:16,945
- And I do my own gardening.
- Your own gardening?

452
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:19,048
- And decoupage.
- Decoupage?

453
00:30:19,125 --> 00:30:22,424
I love to suck cock.
And I arrange flowers too.

454
00:30:22,495 --> 00:30:24,895
Where's those school records, honey?

455
00:30:24,964 --> 00:30:27,899
In the back of her closet,
in the shoe box.

456
00:30:27,967 --> 00:30:31,232
Shoe box!
Yes! I knew that.

457
00:30:31,304 --> 00:30:32,965
Oh, shit.

458
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,472
What now?

459
00:30:36,909 --> 00:30:39,173
"My ideal guy has...

460
00:30:39,245 --> 00:30:42,180
childlike wonder, maturity...

461
00:30:42,248 --> 00:30:45,012
blue eyes, honesty...

462
00:30:45,084 --> 00:30:48,019
knows what to say
without being told."

463
00:30:49,589 --> 00:30:52,023
Does that sound
like anybody toyou?

464
00:30:52,091 --> 00:30:54,025
Forest Whitaker?

465
00:30:55,094 --> 00:30:56,857
Dave.

466
00:30:57,630 --> 00:30:59,962
What the hell areyou doing?

467
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:05,966
House rules. You don't make your own
drinks. Valerie makes your drinks.

468
00:31:06,038 --> 00:31:08,529
Where is Valerie?

469
00:31:08,608 --> 00:31:10,542
Well, whileyou're back there--

470
00:31:11,711 --> 00:31:13,645
He's not gonna sell us out
for a girl.

471
00:31:13,713 --> 00:31:15,772
- He might.
- I don't think he will.

472
00:31:15,848 --> 00:31:18,783
-He might.
-I know Dave, and I don't think he will.

473
00:31:18,851 --> 00:31:21,285
- Thankyou.
- Let me showyou--

474
00:31:21,354 --> 00:31:24,619
You know what? I know where the door is.
You have a pleasant day.

475
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:27,124
I'm gonna--
Thankyou. Good-bye.

476
00:31:27,193 --> 00:31:29,627
No, thankyou.
Thankyou for coming.

477
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:35,630
And where have you been hiding
all this time, my little monkey?

478
00:31:45,077 --> 00:31:49,013
I got lucky at her parents's house
and hit the motherlode of information.

479
00:31:49,081 --> 00:31:51,015
I mean, Angela was perfect--

480
00:31:51,083 --> 00:31:55,349
4.0 GPA, volunteer at a hospital
and a homeless shelter.

481
00:31:55,421 --> 00:31:58,356
I mean, the girl's
neve reven had a cavity.

482
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:03,492
Okay, I'm done. "X" marks the spot.
I'm here. Peace.

483
00:32:03,563 --> 00:32:06,157
Dudes, I'm breaking off
so I can find my homeys.

484
00:32:06,232 --> 00:32:08,200
- Whatever.
- Okay, cool.

485
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:14,205
- So, what's the status with the girl?
- Just a second.

486
00:32:14,273 --> 00:32:16,537
- Go with the hospital?
- Yeah.

487
00:32:17,944 --> 00:32:20,276
So she volunteers at this hospital--

488
00:32:20,346 --> 00:32:22,837
Nope. Oh, no. No hospitals.

489
00:32:22,915 --> 00:32:25,850
- No hospitals.
- You can talk to her at the hospital.

490
00:32:25,918 --> 00:32:27,749
What would me say?

491
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:30,084
You're right. She wouldn't like you.
So we're gonna trick her.

492
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:32,954
We're gonna tell her
you have a girlfriend.

493
00:32:33,025 --> 00:32:35,619
- It's less threatening.
- Find a new plan.

494
00:32:35,695 --> 00:32:38,630
I'm kicking you guys out unless
you find a new place. No hospitals.

495
00:32:38,698 --> 00:32:40,325
You're not getting me
to go to a hospital.

496
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:43,425
- It's a beautiful hospital.
- That's what they said before.

497
00:32:58,918 --> 00:33:01,011
- Angela, you're a big help.
- Thanks.

498
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:05,650
Ethan.

499
00:33:05,725 --> 00:33:07,215
Ethan. Right. From, um--

500
00:33:07,293 --> 00:33:09,784
- Physics.
- Yeah.

501
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:12,660
- How areyou?
- I'm cool.

502
00:33:12,732 --> 00:33:16,964
I didn't know that you
volunteered here at the hospital.

503
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:19,470
Well, I don't. I'm here
'cause you're here. Just kidding.

504
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:22,406
I just hate watching people suffer...

505
00:33:22,475 --> 00:33:25,535
so I figure why not put things
in perspective and help out, you know?

506
00:33:25,611 --> 00:33:28,307
My girlfriend's also a doctor
up in Boston. I think I love her.

507
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:30,315
- Oh, really?
- Yeah. You need any help?

508
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:36,355
Hi, Mrs. Van Graf.
I'm Angela, a student volunteer here.

509
00:33:36,422 --> 00:33:38,356
We brought you your lunch.

510
00:33:38,424 --> 00:33:40,790
Well, I don't want any lunch.

511
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:43,522
Okay, that's fine.
We don't have to have lunch.

512
00:33:43,596 --> 00:33:47,225
We could just have a conversation,
learn more about you.

513
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:50,633
- I'm Ethan.
- I don't want to talk either.

514
00:33:50,703 --> 00:33:52,671
I'm sure there's
a lot we could talk about.

515
00:33:52,738 --> 00:33:54,171
We could watch TV.

516
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:59,303
No, actually, I think maybe we should
learn more about Mrs. Van Grafhere.

517
00:33:59,378 --> 00:34:01,437
Like, are you from this area?

518
00:34:02,148 --> 00:34:03,376
Hell no.

519
00:34:03,449 --> 00:34:05,679
- I came here forwork.
- What did you do?

520
00:34:05,751 --> 00:34:07,514
I worked the docks.

521
00:34:08,287 --> 00:34:10,517
See? She worked on the docks.
That's fascinating.

522
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:13,150
I mean, most women weren't
the least bit interested--

523
00:34:13,225 --> 00:34:15,193
I used to be a whore.

524
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:25,468
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Holy-- Are you okay?

525
00:34:25,538 --> 00:34:27,165
- Are you okay?
- Get Dr. Danvers!

526
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:32,844
- Ethan's gonna take care of this.
- Go get Dr. Danvers!

527
00:34:32,912 --> 00:34:34,846
- I'll be right back.
- I'm gonna stay.

528
00:34:34,914 --> 00:34:36,905
I'm new, so bear with me.

529
00:34:36,983 --> 00:34:40,475
Oh, I'm so hot.
I'm overheating.

530
00:34:40,553 --> 00:34:42,987
- Do you need a Fresca?
- No, I don't need a Fresca.

531
00:34:43,055 --> 00:34:45,421
- What can I get you?
- A sponge bath.

532
00:34:45,491 --> 00:34:47,425
- Over there.
- A sponge bath?

533
00:34:47,493 --> 00:34:50,860
- Yeah.
- Well, I've only sponged myself, but--

534
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:53,262
- Sponge bath.
- Okay, here I come.

535
00:34:53,332 --> 00:34:55,266
Holy--

536
00:34:55,334 --> 00:34:58,394
Oh, sponge me.

537
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:01,269
Oh, so very hot.

538
00:35:02,274 --> 00:35:03,901
Is that better?

539
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:05,910
- Yes.
- You like that?

540
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:08,037
- You've got great hands.
- Oh, thank you.

541
00:35:08,114 --> 00:35:10,048
You've got a great rack.

542
00:35:10,116 --> 00:35:12,050
So, you're cooling off, right?

543
00:35:12,118 --> 00:35:14,245
No, I'm just getting hotter.

544
00:35:14,954 --> 00:35:17,445
- Okay, so,just on the boobies?
- Great sponger!

545
00:35:17,523 --> 00:35:20,686
- Wanna make sure we got everything.
- Oh, you got it.

546
00:35:21,627 --> 00:35:23,561
- What are you doing?
- Sponge bath.

547
00:35:23,629 --> 00:35:25,995
- That is against hospital regulation.
- Let a professional do that.

548
00:35:26,065 --> 00:35:29,557
- You're not supposed to be doing that.
- Put the sponge down.

549
00:35:29,635 --> 00:35:32,900
- This is his first day.
- The dirty old whore told me to do it.

550
00:35:32,972 --> 00:35:34,769
Get away from the patient!

551
00:35:37,309 --> 00:35:41,746
And then it just so happens that they
walk in when I'm sucking on her nipple.

552
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:46,484
So you fingered an old lady?

553
00:35:46,552 --> 00:35:49,146
She was asking for it.

554
00:35:49,221 --> 00:35:51,655
It's totally fixable
from where I'm standing.

555
00:35:51,724 --> 00:35:54,818
How hard can it be?
I mean, right, Sam?

556
00:35:54,894 --> 00:35:57,055
Dave, could you talk to Angela for me?

557
00:35:57,129 --> 00:35:59,063
Yeah, I could talk to her.

558
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:02,501
I was hoping you'd say that...

559
00:36:02,568 --> 00:36:05,503
'cause I'd really hate
to kick you guys out of school.

560
00:36:09,608 --> 00:36:12,475
All right, dudes.
See you later.

561
00:36:16,248 --> 00:36:17,374
You.

562
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:19,975
You were right.
We should study together.

563
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:22,577
- I never said that.
- It'd be a good idea.

564
00:36:22,655 --> 00:36:26,113
- So you use my notes, I do the work--
- I'm not gonna use your notes.

565
00:36:26,192 --> 00:36:29,127
To tell you the truth,
I've got a photographic memory.

566
00:36:29,195 --> 00:36:31,288
I mean,
I practically know everything.

567
00:36:31,363 --> 00:36:33,297
Try me.

568
00:36:33,365 --> 00:36:35,799
- We don't have to do this.
- Just try me.

569
00:36:35,868 --> 00:36:38,302
- Okay, what's the fastest land mammal?
- Cheetah.

570
00:36:39,638 --> 00:36:41,333
What's the only country
to straddle two continents?

571
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:42,965
Turkey. I got one.

572
00:36:43,042 --> 00:36:46,102
A guy and his son are driving
and they get in an accident.

573
00:36:46,178 --> 00:36:49,113
- They go to a hospital--
- And the mother was a doctor.

574
00:36:49,181 --> 00:36:50,944
You see? We got chemistry.

575
00:36:51,016 --> 00:36:52,779
Wow. Did you feel that?

576
00:36:52,852 --> 00:36:54,786
Yeah, it's electric.

577
00:36:56,989 --> 00:36:59,423
All right, there's
a study group Wednesday nights.

578
00:36:59,492 --> 00:37:01,426
507 Obal Hall.

579
00:37:03,863 --> 00:37:05,797
Put that in your photographic memory.

580
00:37:11,704 --> 00:37:15,231
- What about this?
- Is this a study group or a date?

581
00:37:16,408 --> 00:37:17,841
It's a study group.

582
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:21,505
I just invited that guy Dave.

583
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:24,515
Hypothetically, if there is no Ethan,
she's not your type?

584
00:37:24,583 --> 00:37:25,845
She's not my type.

585
00:37:25,918 --> 00:37:28,352
Her gorgeous face and pert
breasts disgust you, right?

586
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:30,854
The thing is, she's got this--

587
00:37:33,759 --> 00:37:36,694
Are you gettin'
the special tingle from this boy?

588
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:40,694
You're getting the special tingle!

589
00:37:40,766 --> 00:37:44,065
- It's not the tingle that worries me.
- What is it?

590
00:37:45,771 --> 00:37:46,863
It's the guy.

591
00:37:46,939 --> 00:37:48,736
You start to change for somebody...

592
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:50,605
and before long they change you.

593
00:37:50,676 --> 00:37:52,769
- You know, and this is--
- Right, right, right.

594
00:37:52,845 --> 00:37:54,870
- This is who I am.
- That's interesting.

595
00:37:54,947 --> 00:37:58,781
You know my policy. You gotta
show the boobs and work the ass.

596
00:37:59,718 --> 00:38:01,242
I have no boobs.

597
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,185
You're right.
We'll work the ass.

598
00:38:06,358 --> 00:38:09,293
-Hi, Angela.
-This is Dave. He's gonna study with us.

599
00:38:09,361 --> 00:38:11,056
Like David and Goliath.

600
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:14,122
You know, maybe you're
an expert in astrophysics...

601
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,134
but some ofus
could use some study time.

602
00:38:16,202 --> 00:38:19,069
Who really cares about this crap?

603
00:38:19,138 --> 00:38:21,629
About a billion Alpha Centaurians.

604
00:38:21,707 --> 00:38:26,076
I am so sick of people
sitting in a room...

605
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:30,515
studying and wasting the most
important years of their life...

606
00:38:30,583 --> 00:38:33,313
worrying about what some dipshit
is gonna say on a test.

607
00:38:33,385 --> 00:38:36,320
This is where it's at.
We should really get out.

608
00:38:36,388 --> 00:38:39,323
So, the concerns of the little people
don't apply to visionaries like you?

609
00:38:39,391 --> 00:38:43,487
It's wasn't you. It was the guys
in the room. It was hot in there and--

610
00:38:43,562 --> 00:38:47,498
- You're holding my hand.
- Well, we might hit a patch of ice.

611
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:54,798
- So I got this plan.
- What's the plan?

612
00:38:56,442 --> 00:39:01,004
I plan to take you to this place where
you can actually study the real thing...

613
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,378
and not what's in the textbook.

614
00:39:03,449 --> 00:39:04,939
What doyou say?

615
00:39:05,017 --> 00:39:07,485
- I'd say it's a good plan.
- All right, then.

616
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:10,784
What one's that?
The one that looks like the Death Star.

617
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:13,816
That's Castratia.

618
00:39:16,061 --> 00:39:19,997
The myth has it that she's the
most beautiful of all the goddesses...

619
00:39:20,065 --> 00:39:23,000
and any mortal man
who would try to court her...

620
00:39:23,068 --> 00:39:27,334
she would slice his manhood off.

621
00:39:29,008 --> 00:39:30,839
- Come on, no.
- No, seriously.

622
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,878
- No. Come on.
- Yes. Seriously.

623
00:39:32,945 --> 00:39:34,879
- Really?
- No.

624
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:07,379
You know what?
My arm's getting numb.

625
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:09,073
Oh, I'm sorry.

626
00:40:09,148 --> 00:40:11,082
- Sorry.
- That's okay. That's fine.

627
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:13,744
It does that, you know.

628
00:40:21,894 --> 00:40:24,328
Was that wrong?

629
00:40:24,396 --> 00:40:26,057
No. No, I mean--

630
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,194
Because-- I'm sorry.
I just thought that--

631
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:32,828
Let me just explain.

632
00:40:32,905 --> 00:40:34,668
I got this friend, and--

633
00:40:36,241 --> 00:40:38,835
He really likes you,
and I cannot do that to him.

634
00:40:38,911 --> 00:40:42,005
You're a very beautiful girl,
but, you know, he's--

635
00:40:42,081 --> 00:40:44,345
- I grew up with him--
- What friend?

636
00:40:44,416 --> 00:40:47,852
His name's Ethan. You don't know him?
Everybody knows him.

637
00:40:50,589 --> 00:40:51,681
I know Ethan.

638
00:40:51,757 --> 00:40:54,055
He's a great guy, and--

639
00:40:54,126 --> 00:40:58,563
I guess I just don't understand
what Ethan has to do with...

640
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:01,793
you and me.

641
00:41:01,867 --> 00:41:03,266
Give him a chance.

642
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:06,395
You'd really get along with him.

643
00:41:06,472 --> 00:41:08,406
You know, Cool Ethan.

644
00:41:11,643 --> 00:41:13,338
Okay, Dave.

645
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:17,111
She'll be comin' 'round the mountain
when she comes

646
00:41:18,484 --> 00:41:20,349
She'll be comin' 'round the mountain

647
00:41:20,419 --> 00:41:22,182
She'll be comin'
'round them ountain

648
00:41:22,254 --> 00:41:24,085
She'll be comin' 'round the mountain

649
00:41:24,156 --> 00:41:26,124
When she comes
Now you!

650
00:41:26,191 --> 00:41:27,590
She'll be ridin'six white horses

651
00:41:27,659 --> 00:41:29,149
When she comes

652
00:41:29,228 --> 00:41:30,786
She'll be riding six white horses

653
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:32,763
When she comes

654
00:41:32,831 --> 00:41:34,423
She'll be riding six white horses

655
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,434
She'll be riding
six white horses

656
00:41:36,502 --> 00:41:39,960
She'llberidingsix whitehorses

657
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:41,973
When she comes

658
00:41:44,009 --> 00:41:45,943
-Jeff, it's Dave.
- Yeah?

659
00:41:46,011 --> 00:41:48,309
- What were you doing?
- Nothing. Nothing at all.

660
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:51,247
Check out Ethan's schedule for me.
Where is he now?

661
00:41:51,316 --> 00:41:53,784
Yeah, he should be
heading for the library right now.

662
00:41:53,852 --> 00:41:56,286
- Awesome. Thanks, man.
- Don't worry about it.

663
00:41:58,390 --> 00:41:59,448
Where were we?

664
00:42:06,432 --> 00:42:08,297
You. Come here.

665
00:42:08,367 --> 00:42:10,801
Have you talked to her?
Does she understand?

666
00:42:10,869 --> 00:42:14,805
She was a little suspicious at first,
but I'm dealing with it.

667
00:42:14,873 --> 00:42:16,306
This is so "F"-ed up.

668
00:42:16,375 --> 00:42:19,310
You said you could get me a complete
profile ofwhat she wants in a guy.

669
00:42:19,378 --> 00:42:22,211
How do you know that she's "the one"?

670
00:42:22,281 --> 00:42:23,714
I just do.

671
00:42:23,782 --> 00:42:27,718
Besides the fact that she's beautiful,
smart and funny, how do you know?

672
00:42:29,288 --> 00:42:31,222
Because of the way she smiles.

673
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:33,224
Because of her smile.

674
00:42:33,292 --> 00:42:36,728
Because when I close my eyes all I see
is her face laughing and moving...

675
00:42:36,795 --> 00:42:40,026
and screaming and screaming
and screaming...

676
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:42,033
and screaming and screaming.

677
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:44,296
- I thought you said you loved her.
- Why do you care?

678
00:42:44,369 --> 00:42:46,929
- I'm just trying to figure it out.
- Yes, I love her!

679
00:42:47,005 --> 00:42:49,405
- Yes, I love her completely.
- You love her.

680
00:42:49,475 --> 00:42:51,033
And I hate her completely.

681
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:54,511
But that's something I want to work on
with just her, me and her together...

682
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:56,013
in a locked room.

683
00:42:56,081 --> 00:42:59,346
So bring me the girl, Dave,
or you and your friends are goin' down.

684
00:43:08,794 --> 00:43:10,489
We have plenty to eat.

685
00:43:10,562 --> 00:43:12,860
Vegetarians on this side,
meat over here.

686
00:43:12,931 --> 00:43:14,865
Hey, how are you, Bill?

687
00:43:14,933 --> 00:43:16,867
- How's everything going? Good?
- Okay.

688
00:43:16,935 --> 00:43:19,927
Angela? Weird!

689
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,374
Ethan, what are you doing here?

690
00:43:23,442 --> 00:43:26,673
Well, I'm in the food service industry
and I like bums, so it's kinda my duty.

691
00:43:26,745 --> 00:43:29,179
Okay.

692
00:43:29,248 --> 00:43:32,445
- Angela?
- Yeah. Hi. How areya?

693
00:43:32,518 --> 00:43:36,045
While I've got you here,
could I ask your advice on something?

694
00:43:36,121 --> 00:43:38,055
Yeah, sure. What's up?

695
00:43:38,123 --> 00:43:41,820
Well, it's kind of about
my girlfriend Stephanie.

696
00:43:41,894 --> 00:43:43,225
Oh, yeah, your girlfriend.

697
00:43:43,295 --> 00:43:46,230
I just need a woman's POV
on the whole "sitch."

698
00:43:46,298 --> 00:43:49,893
Actually, you know what?
Can I talk to you about something?

699
00:43:49,968 --> 00:43:50,900
Sure.

700
00:43:50,969 --> 00:43:54,905
I kinda wanted to talk to you
about us, if that's cool.

701
00:43:54,973 --> 00:43:56,907
Yeah, fine.

702
00:43:56,975 --> 00:43:58,909
I know you don't have
a girlfriend, Ethan.

703
00:43:58,977 --> 00:44:00,945
And I know that you like me.

704
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:04,141
You know, this is kinda--
Can I just be honest?

705
00:44:04,216 --> 00:44:06,241
Go ahead, go ahead.

706
00:44:07,386 --> 00:44:09,547
I really like someone else.

707
00:44:10,622 --> 00:44:12,556
Do you-- Did you--

708
00:44:12,624 --> 00:44:16,253
Oh, my God, I am so sorry.
I led you on.

709
00:44:17,329 --> 00:44:20,730
Angela, I like you as a friend.

710
00:44:20,799 --> 00:44:22,289
You're the sweetest thing.

711
00:44:22,367 --> 00:44:23,664
- Oh, my God.
- Really?

712
00:44:23,735 --> 00:44:25,669
Yes, you completely
misinterpreted everything.

713
00:44:25,737 --> 00:44:27,602
You're not my type.

714
00:44:27,673 --> 00:44:29,504
- Don't worry.
- God, I'm so embarrassed.

715
00:44:29,575 --> 00:44:31,509
It happens all the time.
It's cool.

716
00:44:31,577 --> 00:44:34,239
I'm really happy
that we got this cleared up...

717
00:44:34,313 --> 00:44:36,508
because the guy that I like
is your friend Dave.

718
00:44:36,582 --> 00:44:38,516
- Dave!
- Yeah!

719
00:44:38,584 --> 00:44:40,643
Fudge!

720
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:44,018
I can't stop thinking about him.
I can't shut up about him.

721
00:44:44,089 --> 00:44:46,319
I know!
You can't shut up about him!

722
00:44:46,391 --> 00:44:50,327
- You want me to go talk to him?
- Would you really?

723
00:44:50,395 --> 00:44:54,798
No problem. I'll put it in my book.
I'll say, "Talk to Dave about Angela."

724
00:44:54,866 --> 00:44:56,493
Don't worry.

725
00:44:56,568 --> 00:45:00,004
Come here. Let's get these lousy
sons of bitches something to eat, huh?

726
00:45:05,143 --> 00:45:09,375
Maybe she needs a little sponge bath.
She's so dirty.

727
00:45:09,448 --> 00:45:11,143
Put the underwear
on your head, Ethan!

728
00:45:11,216 --> 00:45:14,344
Please! Oh, Ethan,
put the underwear on your head!

729
00:45:14,419 --> 00:45:16,614
- No! No!
- I love it!

730
00:45:16,688 --> 00:45:18,986
You shut up, Dave!
You shut up, Dave!

731
00:45:19,057 --> 00:45:20,354
Does that feel good?

732
00:45:22,194 --> 00:45:24,321
Does that feel good?

733
00:45:24,396 --> 00:45:26,796
Ethan, what are you doing?

734
00:45:29,034 --> 00:45:31,366
I'm not gonna eat that shit,
you fuckin' retard.

735
00:45:32,404 --> 00:45:35,168
No one calls me a retard,
you freakin' hobo!

736
00:45:38,810 --> 00:45:39,902
Get his shoes!

737
00:45:43,448 --> 00:45:46,383
It's still 22 to 3, mine.

738
00:45:46,451 --> 00:45:48,612
I thinkwe could do better than that.

739
00:45:48,687 --> 00:45:50,621
Come on!

740
00:45:50,689 --> 00:45:53,123
What is that, man?
You wearing musk?

741
00:45:53,191 --> 00:45:56,718
Oh, yeah. I'm going to sing
with this band tonight.

742
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:59,355
- What? You don't sing.
- No, I sing.

743
00:45:59,431 --> 00:46:01,729
- Bullshit. You don't sing.
- I sing!

744
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,768
I sing.

745
00:46:03,835 --> 00:46:06,895
- If you sing, right now sing.
- I'm saving my voice.

746
00:46:10,442 --> 00:46:12,171
Hello! Hello!

747
00:46:12,244 --> 00:46:14,178
Reanna?

748
00:46:14,246 --> 00:46:17,738
- Ethan.
- Yup, and I've got gifts.

749
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:19,443
You just let yourself in?

750
00:46:19,518 --> 00:46:22,715
Angela, I feel really bad
about what happened today with the bums.

751
00:46:22,788 --> 00:46:25,416
Ethan, it's fine. Don't worry about it.
I'm already over it.

752
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:27,424
No, Angela, it's not okay.

753
00:46:29,494 --> 00:46:31,428
I'm bad!

754
00:46:33,498 --> 00:46:35,898
- That's really clever, Ethan.
- Take that. I got it foryou.

755
00:46:36,802 --> 00:46:39,896
I wanted to be sure that you and I
are best friends...

756
00:46:40,972 --> 00:46:42,906
gnome matterwhat.

757
00:46:42,974 --> 00:46:45,442
- Ethan, that's a troll.
- Gnome it's not.

758
00:46:47,479 --> 00:46:49,913
All right, I have to go now.

759
00:46:49,981 --> 00:46:50,913
Wait.

760
00:46:52,451 --> 00:46:55,386
One more thing.
A wee leprechaun.

761
00:46:55,454 --> 00:46:57,888
Okay, that one I don't get.

762
00:46:57,956 --> 00:46:59,651
I'll be your best friend...

763
00:46:59,725 --> 00:47:02,319
until you steal my pot of gold!

764
00:47:04,563 --> 00:47:06,121
Don't do that.

765
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:09,395
- I'm just kidding.
- Okay, time to go. Yeah.

766
00:47:09,468 --> 00:47:12,266
- Okay.
- Remember that favor?

767
00:47:12,337 --> 00:47:14,532
- Talking to Dave?
- Yeah.

768
00:47:14,606 --> 00:47:16,506
Don't. I'll handle it.

769
00:47:16,575 --> 00:47:19,100
I'm gonna see him tonight, so I think
it'll be better ifl handle it.

770
00:47:19,177 --> 00:47:21,111
Oh. You're gonna
see him right now?

771
00:47:21,179 --> 00:47:23,113
- Really?
- Yeah.

772
00:47:23,181 --> 00:47:26,116
Well, that frees me up.
Great.

773
00:47:26,184 --> 00:47:28,118
I hopeyou enjoy the presents--

774
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:42,522
Let me just take this moment
and say one thing.

775
00:47:42,601 --> 00:47:45,331
We have, like, three weeks
till the exam, and--

776
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:48,339
I wrote the damn mock exam!
I gave it to you!

777
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:50,341
"I wrote the mock exam"?

778
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:52,843
Hey, let's get out of here.

779
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:54,845
- No.
- Yeah.

780
00:47:54,913 --> 00:47:57,780
- No.
- No? Come on.

781
00:47:58,917 --> 00:48:00,748
Please?

782
00:48:00,819 --> 00:48:02,684
I'll take you somewhere.

783
00:48:32,818 --> 00:48:35,719
Oh, my God! Thank God!
I thought you were with Dave!

784
00:48:35,787 --> 00:48:37,254
Oh, baby.

785
00:48:40,258 --> 00:48:41,350
Yeah? So what?

786
00:49:44,656 --> 00:49:47,989
I don't know.
I don't want to stop loving you.

787
00:49:48,059 --> 00:49:50,254
I mean, where are you?

788
00:49:50,328 --> 00:49:52,796
Don't make me
put you under lock and key.

789
00:49:52,864 --> 00:49:54,798
I know you're a good girl.

790
00:49:54,866 --> 00:49:58,199
You'd better not be doing something
you're not supposed to.

791
00:49:58,270 --> 00:50:00,295
The big bad wolf's gonna find you.

792
00:50:13,485 --> 00:50:15,612
Been using a new shampoo?

793
00:50:20,926 --> 00:50:22,655
Play a little game!

794
00:50:23,762 --> 00:50:25,696
Duck, duck, goose, huh?

795
00:50:26,898 --> 00:50:28,957
Duck, duck...

796
00:50:29,034 --> 00:50:30,194
goose!

797
00:51:05,870 --> 00:51:07,804
Oh, shit.

798
00:51:07,872 --> 00:51:10,898
Something's wrong.

799
00:51:16,114 --> 00:51:18,412
-Jesus Christ.
- And we're back!

800
00:51:23,388 --> 00:51:25,049
I want to be polite...

801
00:51:25,123 --> 00:51:28,615
but how many decoupage gifts
can you receive?

802
00:51:28,693 --> 00:51:32,823
I don't know. I guess she makes
my dad happy. So what can I say?

803
00:51:32,897 --> 00:51:34,831
Soyou like living in the dorm?

804
00:51:34,899 --> 00:51:36,833
My God, I was so happy
to get out of the house.

805
00:51:36,901 --> 00:51:39,768
My stepmother drives me crazy.

806
00:51:39,838 --> 00:51:43,934
- My real mom lives in St. Louis.
- St. Louis?

807
00:51:44,009 --> 00:51:45,943
She's a Midwestern gal.

808
00:51:47,379 --> 00:51:48,676
That's great news.

809
00:51:49,881 --> 00:51:53,942
Really?
Tell me something about you.

810
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,254
What do you want to know?

811
00:51:57,322 --> 00:51:58,789
- A secret.
- A secret?

812
00:52:00,392 --> 00:52:03,759
- A secret, huh?
- I'm sure you have plenty.

813
00:52:03,828 --> 00:52:05,762
Got a few.

814
00:52:05,830 --> 00:52:09,288
- So tell me.
- Yeah, tell her, Dave.

815
00:52:09,367 --> 00:52:11,335
Tell her the real secret.

816
00:52:11,403 --> 00:52:16,067
Me and my friend,Jeff,
we can control the power on campus.

817
00:52:16,141 --> 00:52:19,076
How's that for a secret?
We hack into the power grids.

818
00:52:19,144 --> 00:52:22,409
Looks like I'm gonna have to pay
your friends a little visit, Dave.

819
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:25,415
Me and my friend, Jeff, we can
control the power on campus.

820
00:52:25,483 --> 00:52:29,214
How's that for a secret?
We hack into the powergrids.

821
00:52:29,287 --> 00:52:32,188
- Don't say a fucking word, Ethan.
- Look at that shot.

822
00:52:32,257 --> 00:52:34,191
He's "doing" his special lady.

823
00:52:34,259 --> 00:52:36,454
Shut the fuck up!

824
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:38,462
I don't want to see
any more, all right?

825
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:41,124
He's "f"-ing you.
He "f"-ed me.

826
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:43,599
And now I got a little movie
of him "f"-ing her.

827
00:52:43,668 --> 00:52:46,102
Dude, enough about Dave.
You don't know a thing about Dave.

828
00:52:46,171 --> 00:52:48,935
He betrayed you.
He stole my girl.

829
00:52:49,007 --> 00:52:52,272
He's not our friend.
What?

830
00:52:52,343 --> 00:52:54,072
Son ofa bitch!

831
00:52:54,145 --> 00:52:58,104
The little freak is right,
all right? Dave screwed us.

832
00:52:58,183 --> 00:53:01,516
He's not the only one who screwed us.
We're getting screwed by the system.

833
00:53:01,586 --> 00:53:05,647
The system that forces us guys
to like girls, all right?

834
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:09,057
We're getting pushed into this. What if
we just take the girls out of it?

835
00:53:09,127 --> 00:53:12,563
We can have our own system.
It's a countersystem.

836
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:16,122
Then you do things together--
You swim, you row, you boat...

837
00:53:16,201 --> 00:53:18,101
you eat, you stink.

838
00:53:18,169 --> 00:53:20,501
We can just be guys.
You can have sex--

839
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:24,201
You can do it, you know, many guys
at a time, but it's not gay.

840
00:53:24,275 --> 00:53:25,833
That's interesting.

841
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:27,844
I'm gonna go talk to
Dean Rattenbaugh about that...

842
00:53:27,912 --> 00:53:31,575
while I'm getting your ass expelled.

843
00:53:31,649 --> 00:53:33,640
- Come over here.
- What?

844
00:53:33,718 --> 00:53:35,276
Sit down.

845
00:53:41,559 --> 00:53:44,960
- Give me the tape.
- Oh, this tape?

846
00:53:47,365 --> 00:53:48,832
What do I get?

847
00:53:51,402 --> 00:53:53,336
This is everything
we have on Angela.

848
00:53:53,404 --> 00:53:55,565
How much of that did I work
to steal my own self?

849
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:57,631
Shut up.
I'm giving it to him.

850
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:02,076
Everything you need
to get the girl is in here.

851
00:54:02,981 --> 00:54:05,006
- On three.
- All right, on three.

852
00:54:05,083 --> 00:54:07,483
- One--
- If I could interject something here.

853
00:54:08,553 --> 00:54:10,487
I'm not gay, you know.

854
00:54:17,562 --> 00:54:20,793
I'm the kind of guy who will

855
00:54:20,865 --> 00:54:24,266
Not insist that
you go on the pill

856
00:54:24,335 --> 00:54:28,066
I'm cool with
splitting the bill

857
00:54:28,139 --> 00:54:30,369
-And I'll kill
- Oh, my God.

858
00:54:30,441 --> 00:54:32,602
- Who you wan tme to kill
- It's Ethan.

859
00:54:34,913 --> 00:54:37,381
Stay there.

860
00:54:37,448 --> 00:54:39,609
You and me

861
00:54:39,684 --> 00:54:42,517
- Hey, new-wave boy!
- Don't you see

862
00:54:42,587 --> 00:54:45,454
Shut the fuck up!

863
00:54:45,523 --> 00:54:48,117
- Don't you see
- Do we fucking know this guy?

864
00:54:48,193 --> 00:54:50,491
My heart is beat-beat-beating

865
00:54:50,562 --> 00:54:52,621
It's Ethan again.

866
00:54:52,697 --> 00:54:56,030
Oh, Angela

867
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:59,627
Oh, how I need you so

868
00:54:59,704 --> 00:55:02,969
'Cause your eyes
are like two shining blue

869
00:55:03,041 --> 00:55:06,010
Rockets in the night
come to take me away

870
00:55:06,077 --> 00:55:08,511
Come and fuck me, baby

871
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:11,048
He is so--

872
00:55:11,115 --> 00:55:13,379
And don't let me hurt you
just by accident

873
00:55:13,451 --> 00:55:15,419
- I probably won't, but
- Shut up!

874
00:55:18,122 --> 00:55:19,214
Fudge!

875
00:55:19,290 --> 00:55:21,588
Ethan, I appreciate
the effort, but--

876
00:55:21,659 --> 00:55:23,923
- I wrote this for you!
- What do you want?

877
00:55:23,995 --> 00:55:26,589
It's 2:00 in the morning.

878
00:55:26,664 --> 00:55:27,824
I wanna come up.

879
00:55:27,899 --> 00:55:30,925
- This has to end, right now.
- Invite him up.

880
00:55:31,002 --> 00:55:33,835
We'll make him clean
the fucking bathrooms.

881
00:55:33,905 --> 00:55:37,671
Besides, maybe he's good in bed.
The little ones always are. Come on.

882
00:55:39,410 --> 00:55:42,436
- Move.
- You can come up for one minute.

883
00:55:42,513 --> 00:55:43,775
Really?

884
00:55:50,688 --> 00:55:52,622
Guys? Hey, yo!

885
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:06,530
Wow!

886
00:56:14,245 --> 00:56:15,678
Love.

887
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:39,294
Okay. I'm going to
fix your nose...

888
00:56:39,370 --> 00:56:42,601
and we're going
to have a little talk, okay?

889
00:56:42,674 --> 00:56:44,369
Okay.

890
00:56:44,442 --> 00:56:47,900
This is not very manlike
ofme, is it?

891
00:56:47,979 --> 00:56:51,107
Ethan, it's a tiny cut.
It's no big deal.

892
00:56:53,017 --> 00:56:55,645
You're right.
It's just a cut on skin.

893
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:59,383
You're so awesome. Your room is
so awesome. Your phone is kick-ass.

894
00:56:59,457 --> 00:57:01,755
And you know what?
I love you.

895
00:57:06,230 --> 00:57:09,495
You and I are just friends.

896
00:57:09,567 --> 00:57:12,798
I have to make that clear to you,
because this cannot continue.

897
00:57:12,870 --> 00:57:14,861
You're still on
this whole Dave thing.

898
00:57:17,475 --> 00:57:19,238
Unbelievable.

899
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:22,108
It's not a Dave thing.

900
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:24,740
I'm in love with him.

901
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:26,750
Have you two been physical?

902
00:57:27,819 --> 00:57:30,413
You know what?

903
00:57:30,488 --> 00:57:31,750
That's it.

904
00:57:31,823 --> 00:57:35,452
What Dave and I do is none of your
business. It's time for you to leave.

905
00:57:35,526 --> 00:57:38,586
I was hoping you wouldn't
take it this far. Damn it!

906
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:40,096
Enough is enough!

907
00:57:40,164 --> 00:57:43,361
Will you quit breathing so loud?
I can't hear what he's saying.

908
00:57:43,434 --> 00:57:47,564
- God, I'm so scared for us.
- It's too late for this, you know?

909
00:57:47,638 --> 00:57:49,572
You've been duped
by the worst kind of con man.

910
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:51,198
When I fell in love with you...

911
00:57:51,275 --> 00:57:53,368
I knew I couldn't get you
because you're so beautiful.

912
00:57:53,444 --> 00:57:55,605
So I paid Dave and his goons
to get close toyou.

913
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,614
He put together
a dossier of information...

914
00:57:57,682 --> 00:57:59,274
which I studied every night.

915
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:01,284
I do not believe
what you're saying to me.

916
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:04,048
How do you think I know
your favorite animal is a monkey?

917
00:58:04,122 --> 00:58:07,455
- Ethan, shut up!
- I said, "Dave, stop. It's over.

918
00:58:07,525 --> 00:58:09,993
She is a lovely girl
with a pure heart.

919
00:58:10,061 --> 00:58:12,586
Don't taint her
with your octopus ink!"

920
00:58:12,663 --> 00:58:15,598
- Something is wrong with you.
- Nothing's wrong with me.

921
00:58:15,666 --> 00:58:18,533
- No, something--
- Bullshit.

922
00:58:18,603 --> 00:58:20,730
You know how he brags
about the power grids?

923
00:58:20,805 --> 00:58:23,171
That's how he's going
to talk about you.

924
00:58:23,241 --> 00:58:26,074
You're just another thing
for him to brag about.

925
00:58:26,144 --> 00:58:29,307
I'm not the kind of guy who would
rub this kind of proofin your face.

926
00:58:40,358 --> 00:58:41,689
Good Christ!

927
00:58:41,759 --> 00:58:43,693
- Stop.Just listen.
- You deserve that, asshole.

928
00:58:43,761 --> 00:58:45,820
- I can explain everything.
- Ethan explained everything.

929
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:48,388
- Don't listen to Ethan! He's psychotic!
- You are a fraud!

930
00:58:48,466 --> 00:58:50,525
You are a child!
You're manipulative!

931
00:58:50,601 --> 00:58:52,762
And worst of all,
you're a whore!

932
00:58:53,938 --> 00:58:55,929
I am not a whore.

933
00:58:56,007 --> 00:58:59,101
You used me
to make a hundred bucks.

934
00:58:59,177 --> 00:59:01,372
Angela, I didn't
do anything like that.

935
00:59:01,446 --> 00:59:04,609
- You didn't?
- I didn't.

936
00:59:04,682 --> 00:59:07,378
I didn't do anything wrong.

937
00:59:14,725 --> 00:59:17,990
Why did you steal
my E-mails, Dave?

938
00:59:25,636 --> 00:59:28,298
I came clean. And you should
have stopped when I asked--

939
00:59:28,372 --> 00:59:31,466
You told her I did it for money?
Huh, you little freak?

940
00:59:31,542 --> 00:59:33,009
What are you doing here anyways?

941
00:59:33,077 --> 00:59:37,070
I'm gonna ask you this right now
and I want you to answer me honestly.

942
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:41,377
Did you...

943
00:59:41,452 --> 00:59:43,386
or did you not...

944
00:59:44,822 --> 00:59:48,451
seduce me because of some deal
you had with Ethan?

945
00:59:48,526 --> 00:59:50,551
See, it wasn't
exactly like that.

946
00:59:50,628 --> 00:59:54,359
Dave, will you just answer yes or no?
Please, just answer me.

947
00:59:56,934 --> 00:59:58,868
- Yes.
- Oh, shit.

948
01:00:00,771 --> 01:00:04,400
Angela, you see?
I told you he was violent! Look!

949
01:00:04,475 --> 01:00:07,569
Angela, please, baby, please.

950
01:00:07,645 --> 01:00:09,772
Listen to me. Listen to me!

951
01:00:09,847 --> 01:00:12,111
This is not a good night for my nose.
I'm gonna go disinfect it.

952
01:00:17,321 --> 01:00:19,915
Well, I don't know about the punch
in the nose, but I think she likes me.

953
01:00:19,991 --> 01:00:21,925
You don't love her.

954
01:00:24,428 --> 01:00:26,362
I do tonight.

955
01:00:30,301 --> 01:00:32,235
Hey, do you have a condom?

956
01:00:36,874 --> 01:00:38,307
Fuck.

957
01:00:41,379 --> 01:00:44,177
I wantyou to get
this bad energy out.

958
01:00:44,248 --> 01:00:48,309
Ethan, I really don't feel like
being touched right now, okay?

959
01:00:48,386 --> 01:00:49,648
Thanks.

960
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:51,984
Then you need a jump-start.

961
01:00:54,225 --> 01:00:55,317
Clear!

962
01:00:56,794 --> 01:00:58,955
Clear! Clear!

963
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:00,463
Ethan, it's--

964
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:04,927
It's been kind of a long night.

965
01:01:05,002 --> 01:01:07,869
I don't want to kick a dead horse,
but that Dave...

966
01:01:09,106 --> 01:01:10,505
he's a bad dude.

967
01:01:10,575 --> 01:01:12,839
You made the right decision.

968
01:01:12,910 --> 01:01:15,003
Thanks for being honest.

969
01:01:16,581 --> 01:01:18,014
No problem.

970
01:01:20,685 --> 01:01:23,950
- I'm tired.
- I know. Me too.

971
01:01:24,021 --> 01:01:26,785
Move over.
Let's go to bed.

972
01:01:26,857 --> 01:01:28,290
Move over.

973
01:01:29,527 --> 01:01:31,859
How about you sleep on the couch?

974
01:01:33,898 --> 01:01:34,990
Okay.

975
01:01:35,066 --> 01:01:38,558
Shh, be quiet.
We're in my girlfriend's dorm.

976
01:01:40,104 --> 01:01:42,197
You wanna what?

977
01:01:42,273 --> 01:01:45,174
No, we shouldn't.

978
01:01:45,243 --> 01:01:48,076
Okay, but you be quiet,
hair doll.

979
01:01:51,382 --> 01:01:53,179
Like that?

980
01:01:53,251 --> 01:01:55,845
I said to her, or him,
I said--

981
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:59,447
- I can't believe you guys.
- Oh, you can't believe us?

982
01:01:59,523 --> 01:02:02,083
You know what? I can't believe you.
You betrayed our trust.

983
01:02:02,159 --> 01:02:05,253
-I did not betrayy ou!
-That's the one thing we had between us.

984
01:02:05,329 --> 01:02:08,423
- I did not betray anyone!
- But you said my name on that tape.

985
01:02:08,499 --> 01:02:09,830
What about that?

986
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:13,199
You might as well have
broadcast it to the whole campus.

987
01:02:13,271 --> 01:02:15,068
Man, I mean,
we can't do that to her.

988
01:02:15,139 --> 01:02:16,231
What?

989
01:02:16,307 --> 01:02:19,208
The guy is a stalker.
I mean, Ethan, he's nuts.

990
01:02:19,277 --> 01:02:22,269
- How was I supposed to know?
- You know what?

991
01:02:22,346 --> 01:02:23,643
Fuck you.

992
01:02:23,714 --> 01:02:26,979
I'm the one who took care of it.
You're out.

993
01:02:27,051 --> 01:02:29,542
I can't trust you anymore.
You're out.

994
01:02:32,623 --> 01:02:33,988
You sure did fuck up.

995
01:02:38,829 --> 01:02:42,731
Butyou didn't fuck up
so much as you fucked up.

996
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:45,428
You find somebody,
and it just feels right.

997
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:47,664
It's like fate.

998
01:02:47,738 --> 01:02:49,899
Exactly!
It was my fate to meet her.

999
01:02:49,974 --> 01:02:52,909
But it wasn't your fate
to be with her.

1000
01:02:52,977 --> 01:02:54,911
Unfortunately, my friend, fate...

1001
01:02:56,347 --> 01:02:58,645
has a different plan for you.

1002
01:02:58,716 --> 01:03:01,378
You will grow up,
go out into the world.

1003
01:03:01,452 --> 01:03:04,819
You'll forget all about
the things that happened here.

1004
01:03:04,889 --> 01:03:06,982
Ethan, Angela...

1005
01:03:07,058 --> 01:03:09,117
the shit we pulled.

1006
01:03:09,193 --> 01:03:11,559
Those hookers that
we thought were girls.

1007
01:03:11,629 --> 01:03:13,859
And you're going to
go out there...

1008
01:03:13,931 --> 01:03:16,764
and no one-- no one...

1009
01:03:16,834 --> 01:03:19,803
can shoot you down
because a woman one time...

1010
01:03:19,870 --> 01:03:23,431
stepped on your heart
and left a scar in its wake.

1011
01:03:23,507 --> 01:03:25,270
That is your fate, Dave.

1012
01:03:26,177 --> 01:03:28,611
Just as it is my fate...

1013
01:03:28,679 --> 01:03:31,204
to some day become shogun.

1014
01:03:44,128 --> 01:03:46,619
Fucking idiot!
Are you kidding me?

1015
01:03:50,968 --> 01:03:54,563
There goes Dave the liar.
I "f"-ed his old girlfriend.

1016
01:03:57,675 --> 01:04:00,872
- Oh, Ethan.
- Oh, Cameron.

1017
01:04:00,945 --> 01:04:03,914
- Oh, yeah!
- Baby, baby.

1018
01:04:03,981 --> 01:04:05,539
Boobies, boobies.

1019
01:04:07,985 --> 01:04:10,453
Stone-hard reality, Dave.

1020
01:04:10,521 --> 01:04:12,455
I asked you to stop.

1021
01:04:15,893 --> 01:04:18,361
Cameron!
Take off my pants.

1022
01:04:21,665 --> 01:04:23,656
Oh, no. That's my mom.

1023
01:05:06,577 --> 01:05:10,877
Is enough enough
Is enough enough

1024
01:05:13,384 --> 01:05:17,150
I saw the sign
When I opened up my eyes

1025
01:05:17,221 --> 01:05:18,620
I saw the sign

1026
01:05:20,791 --> 01:05:23,225
When I opened up my eyes
I saw the sign

1027
01:05:36,774 --> 01:05:41,177
No one's gonna drag you up to get
into the line where you belong

1028
01:05:41,245 --> 01:05:45,341
I saw the sign
I saw the sign

1029
01:05:48,752 --> 01:05:51,721
Guys, I saw the sign.

1030
01:05:51,789 --> 01:05:54,917
And it opened my eyes.
I gotta be with Angela.

1031
01:05:54,992 --> 01:05:58,587
- As your attorney, I can't advise that.
- I'm telling everything. That's it.

1032
01:05:58,662 --> 01:06:00,391
You guys have nothing
to worry about.

1033
01:06:00,464 --> 01:06:03,399
- You're serious about this, man?
- Dead serious.

1034
01:06:03,467 --> 01:06:05,162
I need to be with her.

1035
01:06:05,236 --> 01:06:07,830
Hey, you're not fucking
"seed of doubting" me now?

1036
01:06:07,905 --> 01:06:10,465
Sam, I'm not
going to lie anymore.

1037
01:06:11,642 --> 01:06:13,576
I'm done.

1038
01:06:15,045 --> 01:06:17,980
I have something to say to you.

1039
01:06:18,048 --> 01:06:22,451
And I think that it's important
that I say it out of the cage.

1040
01:06:28,459 --> 01:06:32,555
I think you're doing the right thing.
I've never seen you like this before.

1041
01:06:32,630 --> 01:06:35,656
You know what?
I've never felt like this before.

1042
01:06:35,733 --> 01:06:39,499
Listen, I blew up last night,
but I'm proud of you.

1043
01:06:39,570 --> 01:06:43,233
I wish I could back you up.
I'm not getting kicked out of college.

1044
01:06:43,307 --> 01:06:45,741
This is me.
You have to understand this.

1045
01:06:45,809 --> 01:06:48,642
You guys aren't going to pay for this.
I'm gonna do this myself.

1046
01:06:48,712 --> 01:06:50,942
I never would have given that stuff
to Ethan in a million years...

1047
01:06:51,015 --> 01:06:52,949
If I thought that you
felt this way.

1048
01:06:53,017 --> 01:06:54,644
You did what you had to do.
That's fine.

1049
01:06:54,718 --> 01:06:58,711
I guess I felt
a little bit jealous because...

1050
01:06:58,789 --> 01:07:01,451
you have a girlfriend now,
or whatever...

1051
01:07:01,525 --> 01:07:03,618
and I felt like I was left out.

1052
01:07:03,694 --> 01:07:05,628
Come on.

1053
01:07:05,696 --> 01:07:08,028
- Really?
- A little bit.

1054
01:07:08,098 --> 01:07:10,726
Come here. Give me a hug.
Got nothing but love for you.

1055
01:07:11,635 --> 01:07:15,071
Oh, one, two, three,
four hard nipples. Nope.

1056
01:07:15,139 --> 01:07:19,132
This is really weird. I never thought
we'd see the day when the team split up.

1057
01:07:20,477 --> 01:07:22,638
Wait. Not yet.

1058
01:07:22,713 --> 01:07:27,514
We don't split up yet. Cool Ethan?
He caught you cheating, right?

1059
01:07:27,585 --> 01:07:29,519
- Yeah.
- Right?

1060
01:07:29,587 --> 01:07:32,181
He's gunning for your job, right?

1061
01:07:32,256 --> 01:07:34,224
You know mywhole story.

1062
01:07:34,291 --> 01:07:35,519
You got his stuff?

1063
01:07:37,795 --> 01:07:41,595
One more job, guys.
I say we bury him.

1064
01:07:41,665 --> 01:07:44,190
But wait, you say.
How did we get Ethan's documents?

1065
01:07:44,268 --> 01:07:46,327
Allow me to refresh your memory.

1066
01:07:46,403 --> 01:07:48,769
When you only see two of us,
watch out.

1067
01:07:48,839 --> 01:07:53,003
Because the third one is probably
rifling through your shit.

1068
01:08:02,186 --> 01:08:04,313
It was time toput
ourgifts to use.

1069
01:08:04,388 --> 01:08:08,154
So we splitup into two groups
to take Ethan down.

1070
01:08:10,094 --> 01:08:13,120
First on the list,
Stockton, Ypright and Falk.

1071
01:08:14,465 --> 01:08:17,127
Ethan wanted to work there
more than anything.

1072
01:08:17,201 --> 01:08:19,533
So we thought
we'd lend him ahand.

1073
01:08:27,978 --> 01:08:31,914
Professor Markoe's?
Yes, the exam is today.

1074
01:08:31,982 --> 01:08:33,176
Back on up, slick.

1075
01:08:37,955 --> 01:08:40,788
Oh, God, I'm choking.

1076
01:08:40,858 --> 01:08:43,190
Oh, God, I'm choking!

1077
01:08:43,260 --> 01:08:44,955
God, he's choking
on a piece of steak.

1078
01:08:45,029 --> 01:08:47,190
I don't know what to tell you,
but I think Philip called this one in.

1079
01:08:47,264 --> 01:08:50,199
I run this office.
All of this is me.

1080
01:08:58,842 --> 01:09:00,969
- Oh, fuck.
- Are you all right?

1081
01:09:01,045 --> 01:09:03,138
I'm fine now. Thanks to you.

1082
01:09:03,213 --> 01:09:05,545
Thanks to this
fine, young gentleman.

1083
01:09:08,419 --> 01:09:11,047
If you just let me get in there, I'll
replace that mouse and be outta there--

1084
01:09:11,121 --> 01:09:12,850
Thank you. Fix it.

1085
01:09:12,923 --> 01:09:15,153
Wes Mann. I'm in emerging markets.
And you are?

1086
01:09:15,225 --> 01:09:19,719
Ethan Dulles. I'm actually only here
for an interview with Mr. Leonard.

1087
01:09:19,797 --> 01:09:23,733
Oh, well. Leonard Leonard
and I are very good friends.

1088
01:09:23,801 --> 01:09:25,496
I'm gonna march you
right up there.

1089
01:09:25,569 --> 01:09:27,730
Let me help you out.
You've had such a hard day.

1090
01:09:27,805 --> 01:09:30,899
I look good and everything, but I'm
still freaked out, 'cause of the meat.

1091
01:09:30,974 --> 01:09:33,408
So if you could
give me a little privacy.

1092
01:09:38,515 --> 01:09:40,483
Yes, this is a message
for Mr. Dulles.

1093
01:09:40,551 --> 01:09:44,282
This is Mr. Leonard's office in Human
Resources at Stockton, Upright and Falk.

1094
01:09:44,555 --> 01:09:47,422
- Good work down there, Mr. Dulles.
- You can call meJack.

1095
01:09:47,491 --> 01:09:49,254
Jack?

1096
01:09:49,326 --> 01:09:51,590
It says on here that
your first name is Ethan.

1097
01:09:52,663 --> 01:09:54,597
- Call me Jack.
- All right,Jack.

1098
01:09:54,665 --> 01:09:58,931
Jack, what one word
would you say...

1099
01:09:59,002 --> 01:10:00,970
describes yourself perfectly?

1100
01:10:05,175 --> 01:10:09,407
I'm gonna have to say slave
to the freaky-assed booby.

1101
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:10,811
That's not one word.

1102
01:10:10,881 --> 01:10:13,748
You know, Philip said
that you were available.

1103
01:10:13,817 --> 01:10:16,308
Hurry up, brownie,
cookie, whatever.

1104
01:10:16,386 --> 01:10:18,445
You get into this job because
you like to work with your hands.

1105
01:10:18,522 --> 01:10:20,786
I work with my--

1106
01:10:20,858 --> 01:10:23,918
I work with my hands all the time.
I mean, love to rub you down.

1107
01:10:23,994 --> 01:10:29,591
You ever had a massage with heated
stones? Like nothing you'd believe.

1108
01:10:29,666 --> 01:10:31,600
On your resume
under "activities"...

1109
01:10:31,668 --> 01:10:35,468
you have "smokin' blunts
with the homeys"...

1110
01:10:35,539 --> 01:10:38,269
and "bustin' caps in whitey."

1111
01:10:39,343 --> 01:10:41,470
Can you explain that?

1112
01:10:41,545 --> 01:10:43,513
Please come to
Mr. Leonard's office...

1113
01:10:43,580 --> 01:10:46,140
as soon as you possibly can
for your job interview.

1114
01:10:46,216 --> 01:10:47,808
- Thanks.
- Yes!

1115
01:10:47,885 --> 01:10:51,218
You know as well as I do
how I very well got the job.

1116
01:10:51,288 --> 01:10:53,882
You and me, boy,
we can handle shit, all right?

1117
01:10:53,957 --> 01:10:55,083
Right, right.

1118
01:10:59,663 --> 01:11:02,860
You watch Leonard Leonard
handle some shit.

1119
01:11:04,768 --> 01:11:06,599
Oh, Angela

1120
01:11:10,741 --> 01:11:12,675
Oh, how I need you so

1121
01:11:18,448 --> 01:11:20,279
I see what I wanted to do

1122
01:11:28,859 --> 01:11:30,622
Now

1123
01:11:45,442 --> 01:11:46,875
Yeah!

1124
01:11:51,048 --> 01:11:54,882
Stockton, Ypright andg et
those lousy cheaters expelled.

1125
01:11:57,020 --> 01:11:59,454
Ethan Dulles is waiting
in the lobby for me?

1126
01:12:00,557 --> 01:12:02,582
I don't-- What's the holdup?
I've been waiting a half-hour.

1127
01:12:02,659 --> 01:12:04,354
Still checking.

1128
01:12:04,428 --> 01:12:07,056
You let him in here and your ass
is grass, and I'm the lawn mower.

1129
01:12:08,498 --> 01:12:11,729
Actually, that appointment's
no longer on the books.

1130
01:12:11,802 --> 01:12:14,771
Okay, well, I'll just go
check the books. Bitch.

1131
01:12:14,838 --> 01:12:17,329
Heard you got a little smart
with Mr. Leonard.

1132
01:12:19,509 --> 01:12:21,067
Get him out of here now.

1133
01:12:21,144 --> 01:12:22,611
The lawnmower's waiting.

1134
01:12:22,679 --> 01:12:25,614
I want that punk
thrown out of this building.

1135
01:12:25,682 --> 01:12:28,617
I parked my wheel right out here.
I'm fine. Thanks, guys.

1136
01:12:29,820 --> 01:12:31,947
Can you believe that?

1137
01:12:39,329 --> 01:12:41,957
- Get him.
- Come here!

1138
01:12:43,367 --> 01:12:44,800
Help me!

1139
01:12:50,407 --> 01:12:53,137
This is the final exam.

1140
01:12:53,210 --> 01:12:57,271
From this point on there's
no talking, no study guides...

1141
01:12:57,347 --> 01:12:58,609
no exceptions.

1142
01:12:59,549 --> 01:13:03,542
You have three hours. That's it.
Pencils down after that.

1143
01:13:04,321 --> 01:13:07,654
Begin now.

1144
01:13:23,373 --> 01:13:25,773
Hi. Yeah, we're having
a test here. A final.

1145
01:13:25,842 --> 01:13:28,709
- Hold on. Just wait a second.
- I don't have a second.

1146
01:13:28,779 --> 01:13:29,837
Excuse me.

1147
01:13:31,148 --> 01:13:35,414
- We're having a test here.
- Just relax. This can't wait. Please.

1148
01:13:35,485 --> 01:13:37,282
- You can talk to her after the--
- Just relax.

1149
01:13:37,354 --> 01:13:41,381
These people are taking a test--
They are taking a final exam.

1150
01:13:41,458 --> 01:13:43,756
- Please just give me five minutes.
- Am I coming up there?

1151
01:13:43,827 --> 01:13:46,694
- Is that how it's gonna be?
- Just listen to me. Please.

1152
01:13:46,763 --> 01:13:49,891
Just give me one second.
Okay? Just one second.

1153
01:13:52,369 --> 01:13:54,963
- You think I'm a liar?
- Yeah.

1154
01:13:55,038 --> 01:13:57,370
Yeah. Well, I am a liar.

1155
01:13:58,875 --> 01:14:02,140
Ethan never paid me.
He blackmailed me.

1156
01:14:03,180 --> 01:14:05,705
I did it because
he caught me cheating.

1157
01:14:06,783 --> 01:14:08,842
What the fuck?

1158
01:14:11,388 --> 01:14:13,322
I am a cheater.

1159
01:14:14,591 --> 01:14:16,650
I have cheated my way
through high school.

1160
01:14:16,727 --> 01:14:18,922
I have cheated my way
through college.

1161
01:14:18,996 --> 01:14:20,861
I have cheated my way
through everything.

1162
01:14:20,931 --> 01:14:23,559
I don't think I've ever
taken a test honestly.

1163
01:14:23,633 --> 01:14:27,399
I've engineered blackouts.
I've done bomb threats.

1164
01:14:27,471 --> 01:14:30,872
I've hacked into the administration
network. I've done it all.

1165
01:14:30,941 --> 01:14:34,206
I mean, I think this is the first
legit thing I've ever done.

1166
01:14:35,278 --> 01:14:39,112
And there's no angle.
And there's definitely no scam.

1167
01:14:41,084 --> 01:14:45,282
I'm doing it because--
because I love you.

1168
01:14:45,355 --> 01:14:47,550
You love me?

1169
01:14:47,624 --> 01:14:49,285
I do love you.

1170
01:14:52,896 --> 01:14:55,888
I'm pretty sure
I'm in the wrong class.

1171
01:14:55,966 --> 01:15:01,165
But, I just gotta say,
that was really moving.

1172
01:15:02,105 --> 01:15:04,665
Well, honesty, folks.
Right?

1173
01:15:04,741 --> 01:15:07,835
Isn't that the most
important thing, honesty?

1174
01:15:07,911 --> 01:15:12,075
That's what it's all about. I didn't
understand that until I met you.

1175
01:15:13,750 --> 01:15:16,742
- That was beautiful.
- Thank you. Thank you.

1176
01:15:34,171 --> 01:15:36,264
Well, you'rej ust
Mr. Party Pants, aren't you?

1177
01:15:37,474 --> 01:15:39,635
You all think you know this man?

1178
01:15:39,709 --> 01:15:42,234
Well, I have in my hand
hard evidence...

1179
01:15:42,312 --> 01:15:45,839
that this man is,
in fact, a cheater!

1180
01:15:48,218 --> 01:15:50,880
Why are you clapping?
Why are you clapping?

1181
01:15:50,954 --> 01:15:52,945
Why are you clapping?

1182
01:15:54,724 --> 01:15:56,749
What the hell is this?

1183
01:15:59,262 --> 01:16:01,025
Well, Ethan,
I told her the truth.

1184
01:16:01,098 --> 01:16:03,726
And I told her I cheated
and I told her I loved her.

1185
01:16:05,068 --> 01:16:08,799
- You don't believe him, do you?
- I don't know.

1186
01:16:08,872 --> 01:16:11,340
I want to, Dave...

1187
01:16:11,408 --> 01:16:12,932
but I just can't.

1188
01:16:14,811 --> 01:16:17,075
- I don't wanna. I don't wanna!
- Shut up.

1189
01:16:17,147 --> 01:16:20,048
I couldn't take it anymore.
We're a team. You go down, we go down.

1190
01:16:20,117 --> 01:16:22,347
I don't think so.
Ifyou're not enrolled--

1191
01:16:22,419 --> 01:16:26,253
I am in the class. I'm Sam Schechter.
I got hit by a fucking bus.

1192
01:16:30,193 --> 01:16:32,252
He's telling you the truth.

1193
01:16:32,329 --> 01:16:35,093
I know he is, because he
got caught helping me cheat.

1194
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:39,936
It's a scam. Another scam.
You can't believe them.

1195
01:16:40,003 --> 01:16:42,437
Oh, another scam, huh?
That's interesting.

1196
01:16:42,506 --> 01:16:44,701
Listen, Angela, we took
this picture in Ethan's room.

1197
01:16:45,675 --> 01:16:47,609
If you don't want
to be with Dave, that's fine.

1198
01:16:47,677 --> 01:16:52,273
You might want to avoid getting hacked
up by "eyebrows" on your wedding night.

1199
01:16:52,349 --> 01:16:55,182
What is this?
That's a little weird.

1200
01:16:55,252 --> 01:16:58,710
- Let me see this one second.
- Could you explain that to me?

1201
01:16:58,788 --> 01:17:00,722
Ethan, what is that?

1202
01:17:00,790 --> 01:17:02,815
A picture I let the boys--

1203
01:17:02,893 --> 01:17:04,690
If you think that's weird,
one more thing.

1204
01:17:04,761 --> 01:17:05,887
This is good.

1205
01:17:07,764 --> 01:17:09,231
It's a hair doll.

1206
01:17:09,299 --> 01:17:11,392
Yeah. It's gross, right?

1207
01:17:11,468 --> 01:17:14,232
- Hereyou go.
- Ethan, what is this?

1208
01:17:14,304 --> 01:17:17,068
- Is this a hair doll?
- I didn't make that.

1209
01:17:17,140 --> 01:17:20,268
It fell out of your hair that way
and I want it back.

1210
01:17:20,343 --> 01:17:22,573
-It fell out this way? I don't think so.
-Give it back!

1211
01:17:22,646 --> 01:17:24,978
- I want it back!
- Give it back!

1212
01:17:26,783 --> 01:17:30,651
You're going down!
Why are you laughing?

1213
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:32,278
What?

1214
01:17:32,355 --> 01:17:34,619
- You have a cheater in your midst.
- Where?

1215
01:17:34,691 --> 01:17:36,784
You can't have her,
'cause I own her.

1216
01:17:36,860 --> 01:17:40,762
I'm gonna file criminal charges
on all your asses.

1217
01:17:40,830 --> 01:17:43,731
- He's holding a hair doll.
- I need the cheater's name.

1218
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:46,166
- He answers to Ethan.
- Ethan. Here.

1219
01:17:46,236 --> 01:17:49,069
I had a nickname for you. Want to know
what it was? I'm not gonna tell you.

1220
01:17:50,173 --> 01:17:52,937
- All right, it was "Laser."
- This one right here.

1221
01:17:53,009 --> 01:17:55,842
Hi, Ethan.
Can I see that paper?

1222
01:17:55,912 --> 01:17:58,972
Fine. Yes. Here, here.

1223
01:17:59,049 --> 01:18:00,175
Thankyou.

1224
01:18:00,250 --> 01:18:02,684
His name's right on there.
It's David.

1225
01:18:02,752 --> 01:18:04,219
Okay, Ethan.

1226
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:07,950
This is a copy ofthe final exam,
which is what we're taking right now.

1227
01:18:08,024 --> 01:18:10,083
That means you're in violation
of the honor code.

1228
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:11,354
It's not mine.

1229
01:18:11,428 --> 01:18:13,521
Youj ust handed it to me.

1230
01:18:13,597 --> 01:18:16,589
- Are you crazy?
- I think you're crazy.

1231
01:18:16,666 --> 01:18:18,429
What?

1232
01:18:19,636 --> 01:18:22,696
Give me that test.
You are mine, motherfucker!

1233
01:18:23,773 --> 01:18:26,207
You guys are fucking retarded.

1234
01:18:26,276 --> 01:18:27,641
You know what?

1235
01:18:27,711 --> 01:18:31,112
Why don't you shut your mouth,
you skanky-assed "bee-yatch."

1236
01:18:31,181 --> 01:18:33,581
- Fuckyou, cocksucker.
- Slut.

1237
01:18:33,650 --> 01:18:35,584
- Shithead.
- Ho.

1238
01:18:35,652 --> 01:18:37,085
Monkey boy.

1239
01:18:39,723 --> 01:18:41,884
So what do you say?

1240
01:18:43,059 --> 01:18:44,549
Do I have a chance?

1241
01:18:48,598 --> 01:18:49,826
Yes.

1242
01:18:49,899 --> 01:18:51,332
Come here, then.

1243
01:19:06,816 --> 01:19:10,013
Every now and then, we're all
given a perfect moment.

1244
01:19:11,288 --> 01:19:13,620
A moment where
everything makes sense.

1245
01:19:13,690 --> 01:19:16,557
A moment where everything
seems right andg ood...

1246
01:19:16,626 --> 01:19:19,356
and everything's gonna be okay.

1247
01:19:19,429 --> 01:19:21,727
If you can be kissing
a girl like Angela...

1248
01:19:21,798 --> 01:19:23,959
in the middle
of a moment like that...

1249
01:19:24,034 --> 01:19:27,060
well, you really got it made.

1250
01:19:28,738 --> 01:19:31,730
The university
took stern action.

1251
01:19:31,808 --> 01:19:34,333
We got kicked out of school.

1252
01:19:35,712 --> 01:19:37,646
Sam took it like a man.

1253
01:19:37,714 --> 01:19:39,579
I'm sorry!

1254
01:19:39,649 --> 01:19:42,277
I guess we all learned
a life lesson, except for Jeff.

1255
01:19:42,352 --> 01:19:44,843
Jeff learned a different lesson.

1256
01:19:44,921 --> 01:19:47,082
Jeff learned
how to print diplomas.

1257
01:19:48,591 --> 01:19:52,584
In the end, I guess I realized
you can't scam when it comes to love.

1258
01:19:52,662 --> 01:19:56,655
But still, guys like me,
Sam and Jeff...

1259
01:19:56,733 --> 01:19:58,963
we can't scam
our own natures either.

1260
01:19:59,035 --> 01:20:00,798
We're all still friends.

1261
01:20:00,870 --> 01:20:03,634
I'm still with Angela,
and I've never been happier.

1262
01:20:03,707 --> 01:20:05,004
It's strange.

1263
01:20:05,075 --> 01:20:08,738
You think you got life all figured out,
and it just keeps surprisingy ou.

1264
01:20:08,812 --> 01:20:12,270
And to think, I learned
how to be a better man...

1265
01:20:12,349 --> 01:20:14,408
from getting blackmailed
by that little freak--

1266
01:20:15,819 --> 01:20:17,252
CooI Ethan.

1267
01:20:21,324 --> 01:20:25,988
I love you, but I hate you

1268
01:20:26,062 --> 01:20:31,159
Which brings to mind
how much I loveyou

1269
01:20:31,234 --> 01:20:35,068
We could've worked this out
you know

1270
01:20:35,138 --> 01:20:40,576
In a little room
ln a little locked room

1271
01:20:40,643 --> 01:20:44,636
I'm sorry you had
to settle for Dave

1272
01:20:44,714 --> 01:20:49,151
The one-dimensional man

1273
01:20:49,219 --> 01:20:54,213
He's filed under "cocksucker"
in my little blackbook

1274
01:20:54,290 --> 01:20:59,159
Sweetness can rot your teeth

1275
01:20:59,229 --> 01:21:03,359
Bittersweet cacophony

1276
01:21:03,433 --> 01:21:06,766
But you hold the key

1277
01:21:06,836 --> 01:21:10,203
You hold the key

1278
01:21:10,273 --> 01:21:13,765
To my little locked room

1279
01:21:13,843 --> 01:21:19,577
You hold the key
You hold the key

1280
01:21:19,649 --> 01:21:24,518
To my little locked room

1281
01:21:24,587 --> 01:21:28,421
Please let me

1282
01:21:28,491 --> 01:21:30,925
Out soon

1283
01:21:33,196 --> 01:21:35,130
I love you.

1284
01:26:09,472 --> 01:26:11,565
I've never done a porno before.

1285
01:26:11,641 --> 01:26:13,575
Until now, bitch.
