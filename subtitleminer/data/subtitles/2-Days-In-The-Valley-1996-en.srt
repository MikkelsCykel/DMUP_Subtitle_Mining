00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,469
You know that first amount
of money you offered me...

3
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:41,478
you understand why
I had to turn you down?

4
00:00:42,824 --> 00:00:45,573
I made good money
when I worked.

5
00:00:45,639 --> 00:00:47,527
Yeah, I know,
where I live...

6
00:00:47,592 --> 00:00:49,796
it doesn't look
I'm that well off because...

7
00:00:51,047 --> 00:00:53,152
well, that's because
I was gambling.

8
00:00:53,223 --> 00:00:57,085
I was fucking sick and blew every dime
I made because I had a gambling habit.

9
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:00,605
But now I'm trying to do
the right thing.

10
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,101
Even though we never
worked together...

11
00:01:03,175 --> 00:01:05,597
I value this
in a relationship.

12
00:01:06,536 --> 00:01:09,056
But I won't work for nothing.

13
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,942
Sure, I can use the money...

14
00:01:12,008 --> 00:01:14,397
but I gotta be paid my quota.

15
00:01:15,496 --> 00:01:17,951
You understand that, don't you?

16
00:01:20,423 --> 00:01:22,790
How long since
you've worked, Dosmo?

17
00:01:24,263 --> 00:01:28,540
Hey, you go through a little
dry spell, what's it make?

18
00:01:30,887 --> 00:01:33,124
It makes you stronger.

19
00:01:34,183 --> 00:01:37,479
I'm okay. I always knew
I'd be back.

20
00:01:40,807 --> 00:01:42,662
What is it?

21
00:01:47,591 --> 00:01:49,827
Sounds like she's having
a bad dream.

22
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:10,208
Roy.

23
00:02:21,927 --> 00:02:24,228
I'm on my knees,
where you always wanted me to be.

24
00:02:25,606 --> 00:02:28,159
I never wanted you
on your knees, Roy.

25
00:02:31,014 --> 00:02:33,283
What do I do next,
beg or bark?

26
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:37,826
All right. Come on the bed.

27
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,485
Go to sleep on this side.

28
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,336
- My little worm.
- Don't call me that.

29
00:02:50,406 --> 00:02:53,505
But you were
my little worm, right?

30
00:02:53,574 --> 00:02:55,167
God!

31
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:58,779
Why did you come over?

32
00:02:58,854 --> 00:03:02,236
Because it's our anniversary.
I kept thinking of all the good times.

33
00:03:04,198 --> 00:03:06,336
So, you seeing someone?

34
00:03:06,405 --> 00:03:08,740
No. No one special.

35
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:11,164
How many girls are you seeing?

36
00:03:12,134 --> 00:03:13,475
No one.

37
00:03:16,038 --> 00:03:18,526
- Are you gonna try for '98?
- No.

38
00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:21,182
- What's so funny?
- He is.

39
00:03:24,101 --> 00:03:25,628
What's going on?

40
00:03:25,701 --> 00:03:27,937
He's trying to screw her.

41
00:03:28,006 --> 00:03:30,013
He's in her bed?

42
00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:34,139
When I saw you before I skated,
that's why I fell.

43
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:35,937
Tell me what the fuck's happening.

44
00:03:36,006 --> 00:03:37,086
Please!

45
00:03:37,158 --> 00:03:38,718
Come on, Becky. I miss you.

46
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:40,644
That's why I came over here.

47
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:44,353
Why are you doing this?
What are you doing here? You left me!

48
00:03:44,421 --> 00:03:46,309
I think I made a mistake.

49
00:03:46,373 --> 00:03:49,886
Who's the Norwegian bimbo you brought
to watch me race in Lillehammer?

50
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:52,771
Helga? Did she distract you?

51
00:03:52,837 --> 00:03:54,724
No. No, not at all.

52
00:03:54,789 --> 00:03:57,604
Out of the corner of my eye I saw
this giant, Viking blonde...

53
00:03:57,669 --> 00:03:59,774
with blue eyes
crawling all over you.

54
00:03:59,845 --> 00:04:04,384
Didn't distract me at all. Blocked it
out and came in fourth fucking again!

55
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:05,980
At least you came in fourth.

56
00:04:08,325 --> 00:04:10,561
Let's just go to sleep.

57
00:04:24,453 --> 00:04:27,006
This is a destructive relationship.
I'm not starting it again!

58
00:04:27,077 --> 00:04:29,313
Why am I getting turned on then?

59
00:04:31,973 --> 00:04:35,202
- I know you want it.
- Go call your Viking...

60
00:04:42,693 --> 00:04:44,416
Come on.

61
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:46,939
Becky, I think I'm still
in love with you. I do.

62
00:04:47,012 --> 00:04:51,005
Roy, stop it. I mean it.
Stop it.

63
00:04:55,012 --> 00:04:56,867
I'll throw you out.

64
00:05:00,452 --> 00:05:02,307
Good night.

65
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,875
Oh, God.

66
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:20,409
They're going back to sleep.
Let's go.

67
00:05:20,484 --> 00:05:22,011
What the fuck happened?

68
00:05:22,084 --> 00:05:26,394
Does every other word have to be "fuck"?
Is that the extent of your vocabulary?

69
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,631
It fucking bothers you?
I didn't fucking know.

70
00:06:06,468 --> 00:06:08,290
Very quietly.

71
00:06:09,443 --> 00:06:11,832
This ain't my first barbecue.

72
00:06:14,467 --> 00:06:17,085
You sure she don't have
a fucking dog?

73
00:06:18,115 --> 00:06:21,115
Tough guy like you
is afraid of dogs?

74
00:06:22,659 --> 00:06:24,601
I ain't afraid of them.

75
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:26,649
They just don't like me.

76
00:06:26,723 --> 00:06:30,301
I don't know what it is.
They always growl at me.

77
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:42,241
Teddy?

78
00:06:48,611 --> 00:06:50,466
You don't have the rent?

79
00:06:52,547 --> 00:06:54,849
What would you do
if you were me...

80
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:58,046
and I hadn't paid the rent
for four months?

81
00:06:59,938 --> 00:07:01,564
I would evict me.

82
00:07:02,595 --> 00:07:04,634
I don't wanna be
an asshole, Teddy.

83
00:07:04,738 --> 00:07:06,461
You're not an asshole, Evelyn.

84
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:08,385
I'll be gone tomorrow.

85
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:10,305
Where will you go?

86
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,792
Listen, there's one thing
you could do.

87
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:16,313
I may be moving around
for a while, and...

88
00:07:16,386 --> 00:07:18,274
would you look after Bogey?

89
00:07:18,338 --> 00:07:19,865
You're not giving him away?

90
00:07:25,442 --> 00:07:30,625
What about that agent you ate with once
a week? Couldn't he advance you money?

91
00:07:31,906 --> 00:07:34,110
He doesn't return my calls.

92
00:07:56,706 --> 00:08:00,600
Okay, little man,
one last walk to the park.

93
00:08:32,705 --> 00:08:33,850
Bang.

94
00:08:39,841 --> 00:08:42,426
When I do it,
I'll load it first.

95
00:09:51,168 --> 00:09:52,280
Is she out?

96
00:09:53,376 --> 00:09:54,750
Yeah.

97
00:09:54,816 --> 00:09:56,954
Okay, buddy, lay back.

98
00:10:01,215 --> 00:10:05,917
I'm gonna take the gun out of your
mouth, and you're gonna be quiet, right?

99
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,935
Otherwise I'm going to
have to pull the trigger.

100
00:10:12,031 --> 00:10:13,886
Open up.

101
00:10:15,136 --> 00:10:17,023
So I don't hurt the teeth.

102
00:10:29,215 --> 00:10:30,938
You mind if I smoke?

103
00:10:55,263 --> 00:10:57,947
You have one minute to decide
the rest of your life.

104
00:11:00,831 --> 00:11:03,068
I'm gonna ask you
three questions.

105
00:11:03,135 --> 00:11:05,623
If you lie, you die.

106
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,397
Let him sit up.

107
00:11:11,454 --> 00:11:12,665
Get comfortable.

108
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:17,662
All right.

109
00:11:19,103 --> 00:11:21,590
Forty-seven seconds.
First question.

110
00:11:21,695 --> 00:11:24,062
You met her in Lillehammer.
Who'd she say she was?

111
00:11:25,439 --> 00:11:26,486
Helga.

112
00:11:26,558 --> 00:11:27,987
Helga Svelgen.

113
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:30,103
Did Becky know about
your other business in Norway?

114
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:33,109
Did she know what you did there
besides fall down ice-skating?

115
00:11:34,046 --> 00:11:35,573
I don't know what you're talking...

116
00:11:35,647 --> 00:11:37,981
No use protecting Helga.
She's dead.

117
00:11:38,046 --> 00:11:39,421
Twenty-six seconds.

118
00:11:39,487 --> 00:11:41,658
Helga's dead?

119
00:11:43,775 --> 00:11:45,236
Oh, God!

120
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:50,546
- Can I see that picture?
- Shut your mouth and let me finish.

121
00:11:52,542 --> 00:11:55,062
This is the one
not to get wrong.

122
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:57,271
Was Helga the one
who approached you...

123
00:11:57,342 --> 00:12:00,473
on behalf of the North Koreans?

124
00:12:00,542 --> 00:12:02,779
You have 16 seconds left.

125
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:07,862
I don't know what you're talk...

126
00:12:07,933 --> 00:12:09,821
Just a moment. Was it Helga?

127
00:12:09,886 --> 00:12:12,733
If you don't admit that
she was your contact...

128
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:14,936
in the next ten seconds...

129
00:12:15,006 --> 00:12:16,217
nine...

130
00:12:16,926 --> 00:12:18,104
eight...

131
00:12:18,814 --> 00:12:19,893
seven...

132
00:12:19,998 --> 00:12:21,045
six...

133
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:24,314
five, four...

134
00:12:25,885 --> 00:12:27,195
three...

135
00:12:27,262 --> 00:12:28,691
two...

136
00:12:30,142 --> 00:12:31,451
Okay.

137
00:12:33,982 --> 00:12:35,476
She was my contact.

138
00:12:48,253 --> 00:12:50,108
This thing isn't about
a gambling debt?

139
00:12:52,957 --> 00:12:55,990
Shit! I just got a flat!

140
00:12:56,093 --> 00:12:57,587
Can you believe it?

141
00:12:57,694 --> 00:13:01,850
I'm on my way to a $300,000 commission,
and I just got a fucking flat!

142
00:13:02,621 --> 00:13:05,556
Call Triple-A right away.
Send them to Ventura and Woodman.

143
00:13:05,629 --> 00:13:07,702
Tell them to hurry.
There'll be a big tip waiting.

144
00:13:07,773 --> 00:13:09,180
Do you have enough cash?

145
00:13:09,245 --> 00:13:12,857
Tell Mr. Connelly I'll be there soon.
Apologize. You know what to say.

146
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:16,220
Go to my house and feed the dog.
Wait there till you hear from me.

147
00:13:16,285 --> 00:13:19,002
The thing is
I had plans tonight.

148
00:13:19,069 --> 00:13:21,753
I just assumed you never
have plans, Susan.

149
00:13:27,005 --> 00:13:28,467
Shit!

150
00:14:03,325 --> 00:14:06,074
Hey, what the fuck are you doing?
Get out of the street!

151
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:18,071
Please, help me.

152
00:14:35,612 --> 00:14:37,467
Hold it.

153
00:14:38,972 --> 00:14:40,466
Bitch.

154
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,608
Stop. Stop!

155
00:15:05,468 --> 00:15:09,210
That's my car!
He just stole my car!

156
00:15:16,571 --> 00:15:18,065
Teddy!

157
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:20,849
Teddy Peppers?

158
00:15:20,923 --> 00:15:22,778
Is that you?

159
00:15:24,379 --> 00:15:26,135
It's Ralph.

160
00:15:26,203 --> 00:15:28,275
It's Ralph Crupi.

161
00:15:28,347 --> 00:15:32,690
I did three days work on that feature
of yours called Lights Out.

162
00:15:33,915 --> 00:15:35,770
Oh, yeah, I remember.

163
00:15:35,835 --> 00:15:37,657
Boy, what a bomb that was.

164
00:15:37,723 --> 00:15:39,665
Have you worked since?

165
00:15:39,771 --> 00:15:42,160
Just kidding. Just kidding.

166
00:15:42,266 --> 00:15:45,747
That was one of two or three
in a row for you. I mean flops, bombs.

167
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:48,339
So what happens now?
You go back to TV?

168
00:15:48,411 --> 00:15:51,575
You must be thinking
you're losing touch with your audience.

169
00:15:52,443 --> 00:15:54,810
God, those critics were cruel.

170
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:57,111
I don't think I've ever
read reviews that terrible.

171
00:15:57,178 --> 00:16:00,026
What happened? I read the script.
I thought it was a drama.

172
00:16:00,091 --> 00:16:02,709
What was all that stuff
with the elephant in the middle?

173
00:16:02,778 --> 00:16:05,112
I know, it's a long story.

174
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:07,098
The studio fucked you over.

175
00:16:08,283 --> 00:16:11,545
Hey, you still have the same dog,
the terrier.

176
00:16:11,611 --> 00:16:15,921
This is another one.
That one was hit by a car.

177
00:16:15,994 --> 00:16:18,231
Oh, I'm sorry.

178
00:16:19,547 --> 00:16:21,914
I remember your wife...

179
00:16:21,978 --> 00:16:26,069
used to bring that other one around
the set when he was still a puppy.

180
00:16:27,642 --> 00:16:29,813
How is your wife?
She's an actress, right?

181
00:16:29,882 --> 00:16:30,962
We're divorced.

182
00:16:31,034 --> 00:16:34,383
Oh, God, I'm sorry,
'cause she is so pretty.

183
00:16:35,802 --> 00:16:37,875
I hope you get
another chance soon.

184
00:16:37,978 --> 00:16:40,760
Otherwise, I'll see you down
on the unemployment line.

185
00:16:40,826 --> 00:16:42,680
Just kidding.

186
00:17:40,665 --> 00:17:41,974
Feel good?

187
00:17:42,073 --> 00:17:44,790
Oh, yeah, it feels great.

188
00:17:44,857 --> 00:17:47,224
You live in California?

189
00:17:50,745 --> 00:17:52,152
Chicago.

190
00:17:52,217 --> 00:17:54,704
- Here for vacation?
- Mm-hmm.

191
00:17:57,273 --> 00:17:59,793
- Where are you from?
- Vietnam.

192
00:17:59,865 --> 00:18:01,720
Vietnam?

193
00:18:01,785 --> 00:18:03,989
I thought this was
a Japanese place.

194
00:18:04,057 --> 00:18:06,991
My mother's Vietnamese.
My father's Japanese.

195
00:18:07,065 --> 00:18:09,105
I'm, how you say...

196
00:18:10,169 --> 00:18:11,663
a mutt.

197
00:18:14,104 --> 00:18:17,301
No, you are not a mutt.

198
00:18:17,369 --> 00:18:20,216
You're a very beautiful girl.

199
00:18:20,281 --> 00:18:21,807
Thank you.

200
00:18:23,033 --> 00:18:24,375
Turn over, please.

201
00:18:36,376 --> 00:18:39,191
- Feel okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

202
00:18:46,264 --> 00:18:48,631
I do softer this side.

203
00:19:09,496 --> 00:19:11,023
You like?

204
00:19:12,503 --> 00:19:14,925
That feels very nice.

205
00:19:16,376 --> 00:19:18,743
Oh, you strong.

206
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,694
Nice body.

207
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,095
Oh, look at you, so big!

208
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:32,464
Finished.

209
00:19:35,736 --> 00:19:37,012
You're done?

210
00:19:37,783 --> 00:19:39,539
You want something else?

211
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:43,092
Like what?

212
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,436
Well, what you want?

213
00:19:46,455 --> 00:19:47,699
What could I get?

214
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:50,742
You been here before?

215
00:19:53,016 --> 00:19:55,154
I've been to
massage parlors before.

216
00:19:55,223 --> 00:19:58,125
Just not this one.
Didn't this place just open?

217
00:20:00,631 --> 00:20:02,704
You have nice eyes.

218
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:06,546
Yeah, it just open.

219
00:20:06,615 --> 00:20:08,524
What you want I do?

220
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,505
I'd like...

221
00:20:19,702 --> 00:20:20,946
What's the matter?

222
00:20:21,047 --> 00:20:23,894
I take too much time.
Next customer waiting.

223
00:20:23,959 --> 00:20:25,365
What you want I do?

224
00:20:27,767 --> 00:20:29,425
I should go.

225
00:20:29,495 --> 00:20:31,829
I gotta go.
I didn't realize the time.

226
00:20:31,895 --> 00:20:33,804
I gotta meet somebody.

227
00:20:33,879 --> 00:20:35,734
You want nothing else?

228
00:20:40,118 --> 00:20:41,645
No, thank you.

229
00:21:27,605 --> 00:21:29,329
What happened?

230
00:21:29,398 --> 00:21:32,627
Nothing. She didn't do anything.
Just a straight massage.

231
00:21:34,422 --> 00:21:37,172
- What?
- Maybe she made me as a cop.

232
00:21:39,029 --> 00:21:42,607
Are you trying to tell me that's
a legitimate Japanese therapy studio?

233
00:21:42,677 --> 00:21:45,809
No. I'm trying to tell you
that nothing happened.

234
00:21:45,878 --> 00:21:49,839
That place is definitely a hand job
house, and we're gonna raid it.

235
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:53,258
Every one of them slanty-eyed whores I
am gonna personally throw in the can...

236
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:55,667
and make sure
they're deported.

237
00:22:01,046 --> 00:22:04,177
Hey, Alvin,
can I ask you a question?

238
00:22:06,069 --> 00:22:09,931
I hate it when people ask me if
they can ask a question. Just ask it.

239
00:22:10,965 --> 00:22:12,459
Why do you hate Asians so much?

240
00:22:12,533 --> 00:22:15,849
I don't hate Asians.
I don't like whores.

241
00:22:20,821 --> 00:22:22,708
- Hey, Alvin?
- Just ask it.

242
00:22:22,773 --> 00:22:26,156
Okay. There are about a hundred
massage parlors in L.A.

243
00:22:26,229 --> 00:22:30,004
For years, Vice hasn't bothered
any of them. Why start now?

244
00:22:30,069 --> 00:22:31,978
Because this one's
in the Valley.

245
00:22:32,085 --> 00:22:33,808
All the others are downtown...

246
00:22:33,877 --> 00:22:37,423
or in Culver City or Santa Monica,
but this one's right in the Valley...

247
00:22:37,493 --> 00:22:39,827
and there are gonna be
no massage parlors in the Valley!

248
00:22:39,893 --> 00:22:42,544
I was born two miles from here.
I own a house in Studio City.

249
00:22:42,613 --> 00:22:45,580
This is a nice place to live.
I would like to keep it that way.

250
00:22:45,653 --> 00:22:47,595
That fuckin' place
opened four weeks ago...

251
00:22:47,669 --> 00:22:49,970
and it ain't gonna operate
a day after today.

252
00:22:50,037 --> 00:22:51,313
Does that answer your question?

253
00:22:55,157 --> 00:22:56,618
Good.

254
00:22:56,692 --> 00:22:58,667
I thought this was a thing
out of New York.

255
00:22:58,741 --> 00:23:01,708
I thought this was a bad guy
who welched on a bet.

256
00:23:02,773 --> 00:23:05,139
What was all this shit
about Koreans and spies?

257
00:23:06,196 --> 00:23:09,971
You know,
curiosity killed the cat.

258
00:23:11,477 --> 00:23:13,135
You're a real pisser,
aren't you?

259
00:23:13,204 --> 00:23:16,171
You like fucking with people's heads?
How did you find me?

260
00:23:17,044 --> 00:23:19,280
In the phone book
under "Washout."

261
00:23:21,685 --> 00:23:23,888
You know about that.

262
00:23:23,956 --> 00:23:27,666
Look, I'm grateful
for a chance at a...

263
00:23:29,172 --> 00:23:30,601
at a comeback.

264
00:23:31,636 --> 00:23:34,768
To tell you the truth, you know
what I was doing when you called?

265
00:23:34,868 --> 00:23:36,494
Flipping pizzas at Polly's.

266
00:23:37,908 --> 00:23:40,843
Who the fuck are you?
How come you know so much about me?

267
00:23:40,916 --> 00:23:44,178
I know more about you than
you know about yourself, "Dumbo."

268
00:23:44,244 --> 00:23:46,382
My name is Dosmo.

269
00:23:46,451 --> 00:23:48,361
Dosmo Pizzo.

270
00:24:01,652 --> 00:24:03,757
What do you know about me
that I don't know?

271
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,289
This is where you get out.

272
00:24:33,427 --> 00:24:35,467
Have a little coke.

273
00:24:53,267 --> 00:24:55,601
All done, honey?

274
00:24:55,667 --> 00:24:57,577
- What a buffoon.
- Roy?

275
00:24:57,651 --> 00:24:59,593
Dumbo, the pizza man.

276
00:25:00,531 --> 00:25:03,214
Roy's dead, right?
You killed him?

277
00:25:03,283 --> 00:25:05,966
- Why, you gonna miss him?
- Of course not.

278
00:25:06,034 --> 00:25:07,922
You didn't enjoy yourself
with him?

279
00:25:07,987 --> 00:25:09,842
We have to get out of here.

280
00:25:09,907 --> 00:25:12,111
You definitely didn't sleep
with Roy?

281
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:14,546
We're not going
through this again.

282
00:25:14,611 --> 00:25:15,953
What exactly did you do?

283
00:25:16,019 --> 00:25:18,091
We kissed, necked. That's all.

284
00:25:18,162 --> 00:25:19,723
- He didn't touch your breasts?
- No.

285
00:25:22,195 --> 00:25:26,864
I'm just telling you, if I found out
you were lying, I'd go crazy.

286
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:37,799
Don't go crazy, okay?
Now let's just go.

287
00:26:59,313 --> 00:27:02,160
I can walk by myself!

288
00:27:02,225 --> 00:27:04,778
- Let me help.
- I don't need it, all right?

289
00:27:04,849 --> 00:27:08,013
I'm not a cripple.
I'm just sore.

290
00:27:08,081 --> 00:27:10,154
Hot and sore.

291
00:27:10,225 --> 00:27:12,941
It must be 110 fucking degrees!

292
00:27:14,929 --> 00:27:16,717
What happened up there?

293
00:27:16,817 --> 00:27:20,429
A car fire. Some kids
blew up a car up there, I think.

294
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:36,046
Oh, shit.

295
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:37,935
A fucking dog!

296
00:27:44,528 --> 00:27:46,383
A dog! Fuck!

297
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,014
Do you have to follow
a special diet now too?

298
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,455
Yep.

299
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,749
No more dairy products,
no red meat...

300
00:28:00,816 --> 00:28:03,566
no milk, no nuts,
no coffee, no tea...

301
00:28:03,632 --> 00:28:05,487
no chocolate.

302
00:28:06,672 --> 00:28:08,527
- No sex.
- Are you kidding?

303
00:28:08,592 --> 00:28:10,697
I've got to drink three gallons
of water a day.

304
00:28:10,768 --> 00:28:13,256
I never want to be without
a glass of water in my hand.

305
00:28:13,328 --> 00:28:16,623
I have to be constantly
pouring water down my throat.

306
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,534
Where's the only joy
of my life?

307
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,414
He was by the pool
when I left.

308
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,796
You fed him last night?
Flavored his food with bacon?

309
00:28:29,872 --> 00:28:31,497
Yes.

310
00:28:31,567 --> 00:28:33,934
- Good girl.
- Me or the dog?

311
00:28:33,999 --> 00:28:36,585
The dog is a boy.

312
00:28:44,144 --> 00:28:45,420
Oh, shit!

313
00:28:45,488 --> 00:28:46,894
Sorry.

314
00:28:49,584 --> 00:28:52,039
Open the door
and let the air in.

315
00:28:52,143 --> 00:28:54,314
And let Mark in.

316
00:28:54,415 --> 00:28:59,816
Call the hospital. Find the name of
the fag who gave his credit card for me.

317
00:28:59,887 --> 00:29:04,011
I want to send him,
maybe, a Chagall lithograph.

318
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:05,989
That's very generous.

319
00:29:06,064 --> 00:29:07,918
Thanks.

320
00:29:07,983 --> 00:29:10,122
I owe this guy.

321
00:29:10,191 --> 00:29:12,046
He might have saved my life.

322
00:29:12,111 --> 00:29:14,118
You must still be sedated.

323
00:29:14,191 --> 00:29:17,901
You never gave me a Chagall print,
and I've worked for you for eight years.

324
00:29:19,247 --> 00:29:23,044
Susan, if you wanted,
I could give you something better.

325
00:29:25,678 --> 00:29:26,726
What?

326
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:31,374
With a little surgery,
you don't have to be that homely.

327
00:29:32,495 --> 00:29:36,205
I'd pay for implants and liposuction,
but don't take it as an insult.

328
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:39,694
You know how much I like you.

329
00:29:43,087 --> 00:29:45,094
I'll let your dog in.

330
00:29:45,167 --> 00:29:49,258
If you fixed yourself up,
you might meet a man.

331
00:29:52,974 --> 00:29:55,974
Hello, Audrey, it's me.

332
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:58,413
Your kidney stone-less
half-brother.

333
00:29:58,478 --> 00:30:00,333
That's right.
I had them last night.

334
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:03,944
Did Mom have kidney stones?
The urologist wanted to know.

335
00:30:04,015 --> 00:30:07,495
If you're checking your machine
before you leave work, just come on by.

336
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,117
I need a nurse.

337
00:30:12,111 --> 00:30:13,321
Susan?

338
00:30:14,446 --> 00:30:16,966
Susan, don't be so sensitive.

339
00:30:18,254 --> 00:30:19,815
Christ!

340
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:24,933
For God sakes, Susan.
Come back inside.

341
00:30:35,022 --> 00:30:36,266
Call him off!

342
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:37,610
Who are you?

343
00:30:38,606 --> 00:30:40,461
Call your fucking dog off!

344
00:30:40,526 --> 00:30:41,420
Mark!

345
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:44,299
Come here!

346
00:30:46,254 --> 00:30:48,523
Mark! Heel!

347
00:30:49,357 --> 00:30:50,852
Call him off!

348
00:30:50,925 --> 00:30:54,602
He's not vicious. He wants to fetch.
He's waiting for you to throw the gun.

349
00:30:55,534 --> 00:30:58,184
You better get over here...

350
00:30:58,253 --> 00:31:00,195
and drag him away,
or I'll shoot him.

351
00:31:01,293 --> 00:31:03,563
And then I'll shoot
the both of you too.

352
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:06,347
Do you have something to do with
that car that blew up on Mulholland?

353
00:31:06,414 --> 00:31:09,675
I was supposed to be
in the car.

354
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:14,411
There's a man that's gonna come looking
for me to finish the job he botched.

355
00:31:16,685 --> 00:31:19,303
- I'd like to borrow your car keys.
- Give him the keys.

356
00:31:25,837 --> 00:31:27,626
I'm going to pull him away.

357
00:31:29,037 --> 00:31:31,492
Good idea. Prick fuck.

358
00:31:32,589 --> 00:31:34,531
Fuck prick. Fuck you.

359
00:31:40,045 --> 00:31:41,867
God, are you ugly.

360
00:31:46,125 --> 00:31:47,947
Do I know you?

361
00:31:48,013 --> 00:31:49,922
- Me?
- You look familiar.

362
00:31:49,997 --> 00:31:52,102
- Susan, let him go.
- Susan what?

363
00:31:52,173 --> 00:31:54,758
Parish,
but I changed it from Pollutzo.

364
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:58,407
Pollutzo is a beautiful name.
You shouldn't have changed it.

365
00:32:01,196 --> 00:32:04,808
- You got a smoke?
- No, I don't smoke.

366
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:08,682
Look, I'm not a thief,
but I need money.

367
00:32:08,749 --> 00:32:10,636
I lost my wallet.

368
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,515
No, not yours. His.

369
00:32:14,669 --> 00:32:16,578
All I is have is about $40.

370
00:32:34,189 --> 00:32:36,098
It's crooked.

371
00:32:54,668 --> 00:32:56,162
Pollutzo?

372
00:33:04,844 --> 00:33:06,699
Shit! Shit!

373
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:16,034
Leave the dog outside.

374
00:33:17,035 --> 00:33:18,409
You two come in.

375
00:33:18,476 --> 00:33:20,330
Shut the door!

376
00:33:23,403 --> 00:33:26,054
You got anything to eat here?
I'm fucking starving.

377
00:33:26,124 --> 00:33:28,131
Got any pasta, marinara sauce?

378
00:33:28,203 --> 00:33:29,730
Any garlic?

379
00:33:29,804 --> 00:33:33,317
Why don't you just go?
Take the car and leave.

380
00:33:33,388 --> 00:33:34,914
You want us to cook for you?

381
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:39,144
No, no, I'll cook.

382
00:33:41,963 --> 00:33:44,997
You know, people don't realize
how important a minute is.

383
00:33:45,099 --> 00:33:48,328
So much life revolves
around a single minute.

384
00:33:49,643 --> 00:33:53,255
You have a minute egg,
minute waltz, Minute Rice.

385
00:33:54,507 --> 00:33:57,573
People are always demanding
you give them a minute.

386
00:33:57,643 --> 00:34:02,051
Nobody realizes how valuable it is
until they only have one left.

387
00:34:05,739 --> 00:34:07,332
Wait.

388
00:34:08,395 --> 00:34:10,370
Just stand there a minute.

389
00:34:12,299 --> 00:34:14,470
I just wanna look at you.

390
00:34:19,563 --> 00:34:22,824
God definitely broke the mold
after you, baby.

391
00:34:22,922 --> 00:34:25,573
Tell that to my modeling agency.

392
00:34:26,795 --> 00:34:28,650
Tell them yourself.

393
00:34:32,267 --> 00:34:34,689
You're not too tall.

394
00:34:35,722 --> 00:34:38,210
It's the world
that's too short.

395
00:34:54,410 --> 00:34:56,963
God, you are beautiful.

396
00:35:03,498 --> 00:35:06,694
You know,
when I asked Roy...

397
00:35:08,554 --> 00:35:11,336
if you approached him
on behalf of the North Koreans...

398
00:35:11,402 --> 00:35:14,697
and he had 16 seconds
to answer...

399
00:35:16,746 --> 00:35:19,047
I think he wet his bed.

400
00:35:21,066 --> 00:35:23,335
Why did you go through
that ridiculous story?

401
00:35:23,401 --> 00:35:25,573
Just to torture him?

402
00:35:27,722 --> 00:35:31,071
Sometimes I think you should've been
born during the Spanish Inquisition.

403
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:40,134
Your minute is up.

404
00:35:46,218 --> 00:35:48,160
Lay back.

405
00:35:48,265 --> 00:35:50,654
Don't put your hand
around my throat.

406
00:35:50,761 --> 00:35:52,322
I think you like it a little.

407
00:35:52,425 --> 00:35:54,694
No, I don't.
It makes me not trust you.

408
00:35:54,762 --> 00:35:56,354
You can trust me.

409
00:35:57,577 --> 00:35:59,650
You can always trust me.

410
00:36:05,193 --> 00:36:08,575
Just like I trusted you
with Roy.

411
00:36:08,649 --> 00:36:11,519
Which breast did he touch?
This one?

412
00:36:18,185 --> 00:36:20,454
He didn't have to touch either
the way it turned out.

413
00:36:21,352 --> 00:36:24,167
Why did you change your mind?

414
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:30,208
I thought the idea of the affair was
to lure him to the desert to kill him.

415
00:36:32,072 --> 00:36:35,488
But I know why you did it
at Becky's house.

416
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,989
Why?

417
00:36:40,137 --> 00:36:42,373
You got jealous.

418
00:36:42,441 --> 00:36:44,928
You let it get to you personally.

419
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,815
You've never done that before.

420
00:36:52,969 --> 00:36:55,489
I guess I must really
be in love with you.

421
00:37:25,352 --> 00:37:26,726
You got any rapini?

422
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,636
What is that?

423
00:37:29,704 --> 00:37:32,225
An Italian vegetable,
like broccoli.

424
00:37:32,296 --> 00:37:34,685
He doesn't have any.
I do the shopping.

425
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,899
Keep it in the house.
It's good for you.

426
00:37:36,968 --> 00:37:40,099
It's got a ton of vitamins
and minerals. Prevents cancer.

427
00:37:40,168 --> 00:37:42,557
I eat it on a daily basis.

428
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,494
What are your pants
stained with?

429
00:37:53,448 --> 00:37:55,204
Oh, yeah.

430
00:37:55,272 --> 00:37:57,857
I gotta borrow
a change of clothes.

431
00:37:57,959 --> 00:38:00,774
Why was that car
you were in blown up?

432
00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:02,694
Why does that man
want to kill you?

433
00:38:02,759 --> 00:38:05,247
What were you two
involved in?

434
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,043
You think I'm gonna tell you?

435
00:38:07,111 --> 00:38:11,235
He doesn't know. You don't know
why that man tried to kill you, do you?

436
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:15,173
You're a pretty smart cookie,
aren't you?

437
00:38:16,904 --> 00:38:19,293
Anybody in your family connected?

438
00:38:19,367 --> 00:38:21,953
No, I'm not from New York.
I grew up in Reseda.

439
00:38:24,039 --> 00:38:28,098
We got people out here.
We got people everywhere.

440
00:38:40,583 --> 00:38:42,438
You guys are hungry, right?

441
00:38:43,303 --> 00:38:44,797
Well, I could eat.

442
00:38:44,871 --> 00:38:46,911
Well, sit down.
It's almost ready.

443
00:38:48,615 --> 00:38:49,957
Don't do that!

444
00:38:52,359 --> 00:38:53,952
You sit in the chair.

445
00:38:58,759 --> 00:39:01,246
He's sitting on the floor.

446
00:39:01,351 --> 00:39:04,766
He's a rude little shit,
and that's his punishment.

447
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:08,482
I heard the comment you made before
while I was by the pool.

448
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:12,893
If you weren't injured,
you'd catch a beating.

449
00:39:12,967 --> 00:39:17,701
And don't listen to that plastic surgery
bullshit. You're very attractive.

450
00:39:18,598 --> 00:39:20,900
Don't change a thing.

451
00:39:20,967 --> 00:39:23,039
You don't think
I need a nose job?

452
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:25,412
Fuck no,
you don't need a nose job!

453
00:39:26,406 --> 00:39:28,959
Good, because she already had one.

454
00:39:30,246 --> 00:39:32,963
- Please!
- Oh, shit!

455
00:39:33,062 --> 00:39:36,258
Sit down on the floor.
By your window.

456
00:39:36,327 --> 00:39:37,952
By your dog!

457
00:39:38,022 --> 00:39:42,626
He doesn't mean anything by it. He's
naturally cruel. Don't take offense.

458
00:39:42,694 --> 00:39:47,615
While I'm here, you don't make no more
apologies for him. New rule, okay?

459
00:39:52,358 --> 00:39:53,568
Okay.

460
00:39:53,638 --> 00:39:57,893
As a matter of fact, you don't make
no apologies for nobody in your life...

461
00:39:57,957 --> 00:39:59,713
including yourself.

462
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:05,531
You mind serving?

463
00:40:36,902 --> 00:40:38,363
My God!

464
00:40:47,237 --> 00:40:50,368
Remember, you gotta have her
on tape propositioning you.

465
00:40:50,437 --> 00:40:52,412
Keep that earring toward her.

466
00:40:52,485 --> 00:40:55,551
You gotta negotiate a price.
Be specific.

467
00:40:55,621 --> 00:40:58,621
How much for a hand job,
blow job.

468
00:40:58,693 --> 00:41:01,540
If you don't get it on tape,
the DA won't prosecute.

469
00:41:03,045 --> 00:41:05,434
This goddamn fucking
air conditioner!

470
00:41:05,508 --> 00:41:08,378
Hottest day in the fucking Valley
and it breaks!

471
00:41:08,485 --> 00:41:10,143
What's the matter?

472
00:41:10,245 --> 00:41:11,587
Nothing.

473
00:41:11,653 --> 00:41:13,922
You don't look like
you're into this.

474
00:41:13,989 --> 00:41:18,212
I'm supposed to be excited
about busting a massage parlor?

475
00:41:18,277 --> 00:41:21,146
You really think closing this place
down is gonna have a major impact...

476
00:41:21,221 --> 00:41:22,847
on your precious Valley?

477
00:41:22,917 --> 00:41:24,411
These people spread disease.

478
00:41:26,021 --> 00:41:28,771
Oh, geez. Why am I justifying
your job to you?

479
00:41:28,837 --> 00:41:32,132
What the hell did you think you were
gonna do when you transferred to Vice?

480
00:41:32,196 --> 00:41:34,051
Wanna know what I think?

481
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:38,175
I was in that massage parlor,
and I liked that girl. Yeah.

482
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:40,962
Sweet kid. Woman who runs
the place...

483
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:44,803
probably gave her a ticket, brought
her over, working to pay her debt...

484
00:41:44,868 --> 00:41:48,643
She is a dick-head. We should bust her.
Absolutely, but not this kid.

485
00:41:48,708 --> 00:41:49,984
She's just...

486
00:41:50,052 --> 00:41:51,907
a victim of circumstance.

487
00:41:51,972 --> 00:41:53,860
You're a fucking bleeding-heart liberal.

488
00:41:53,924 --> 00:41:57,699
No, I'm not. I'm just fed up.

489
00:41:57,764 --> 00:42:00,960
I joined the force
to get into Homicide...

490
00:42:01,028 --> 00:42:02,817
to bust people who commit murder.

491
00:42:04,612 --> 00:42:07,165
I want to be a detective,
but I can't seem to make it happen.

492
00:42:07,236 --> 00:42:10,302
I can't get promoted into Homicide,
so I transfer around...

493
00:42:10,372 --> 00:42:12,990
from Robbery to Bunko
to Forgery to Vice.

494
00:42:13,092 --> 00:42:14,979
I spent ten years
banging around.

495
00:42:15,076 --> 00:42:17,564
I'm not doing
what I want to do.

496
00:42:21,507 --> 00:42:25,217
You ain't going in there.
You ain't gonna make this bust happen.

497
00:42:25,284 --> 00:42:27,488
You're gonna fuck it up.

498
00:42:29,252 --> 00:42:31,423
You're right.
I'm not going in there.

499
00:42:34,147 --> 00:42:35,195
24-10...

500
00:42:35,268 --> 00:42:36,674
this is AC-6.

501
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:38,649
We got a problem.

502
00:42:38,724 --> 00:42:42,040
- We are not going forward.
- Help, help.

503
00:42:46,371 --> 00:42:48,760
He's dead.
Somebody killed him.

504
00:42:49,828 --> 00:42:51,584
Do you have a car phone?

505
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:53,823
I need to call the police.

506
00:42:56,515 --> 00:42:58,719
Lady, we are the police.

507
00:43:06,307 --> 00:43:07,802
Bogey...

508
00:43:08,835 --> 00:43:10,362
come here.

509
00:44:04,674 --> 00:44:05,852
Shut up.

510
00:44:08,194 --> 00:44:10,082
Shut up!

511
00:44:10,146 --> 00:44:12,928
Somebody will find you
and take you.

512
00:44:13,954 --> 00:44:16,191
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

513
00:44:17,251 --> 00:44:19,389
You're a good boy.
You're the best boy.

514
00:44:19,458 --> 00:44:22,360
You'll have a nice house
and everything.

515
00:44:22,466 --> 00:44:24,375
Give papa a kiss.

516
00:45:06,465 --> 00:45:08,320
Hi, Jaime.

517
00:45:09,026 --> 00:45:10,880
How you doing?

518
00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:17,850
Shh.

519
00:45:26,753 --> 00:45:28,641
I'll miss you...

520
00:45:28,705 --> 00:45:30,560
like always.

521
00:45:35,841 --> 00:45:37,663
Bogey, come on.

522
00:45:37,729 --> 00:45:40,446
Excuse me? Miss?

523
00:45:42,113 --> 00:45:45,658
I was wondering if perhaps
you might want a dog?

524
00:45:45,728 --> 00:45:48,794
I have to move, and they don't
allow pets where I'm going.

525
00:45:48,864 --> 00:45:50,239
Then don't move.

526
00:45:50,305 --> 00:45:53,534
It's more complicated than that.
I have to leave the country.

527
00:45:55,809 --> 00:45:58,078
Oh, boy, it's hot today,
isn't it?

528
00:45:58,177 --> 00:46:00,926
I just came here from the Valley.
It's hell over there.

529
00:46:00,992 --> 00:46:04,473
The reason I stopped you, you being
a nurse, I thought, perhaps...

530
00:46:04,545 --> 00:46:07,741
one of the patients
at the hospital you work at...

531
00:46:07,808 --> 00:46:10,175
might be interested
in a companion.

532
00:46:11,904 --> 00:46:13,366
What do you do?

533
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,862
I'm a writer-director.

534
00:46:18,913 --> 00:46:20,506
Do you make war movies?

535
00:46:20,577 --> 00:46:23,446
War movies?
You like war movies?

536
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,375
Yeah, they're my favorites.

537
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,604
No, I never made a war movie,
though there's probably a lot of...

538
00:46:29,504 --> 00:46:32,635
great stories in this cemetery.

539
00:46:32,704 --> 00:46:34,679
My mother was a nurse
in World War Two.

540
00:46:36,992 --> 00:46:39,294
Did you lose a family member
to war?

541
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:42,175
I lost a friend.

542
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:45,720
Would I have seen something you've done?
I don't just see war movies.

543
00:46:45,792 --> 00:46:47,353
Arthur's Last Hope.

544
00:46:47,424 --> 00:46:50,042
It was a TV movie.
Did you see that?

545
00:46:50,751 --> 00:46:53,118
No, I didn't,
but I think I heard of it.

546
00:46:53,184 --> 00:46:55,485
What else have you done?

547
00:46:57,088 --> 00:46:59,935
Something called Lights Out.

548
00:47:00,032 --> 00:47:02,781
Lights Out? You did that?

549
00:47:03,647 --> 00:47:06,397
- You saw it?
- Yes, I did.

550
00:47:06,463 --> 00:47:09,943
It was very funny.
I was the only one laughing, but yeah.

551
00:47:10,015 --> 00:47:12,154
Were you the only one
in the theater?

552
00:47:13,343 --> 00:47:15,798
I still liked it. Especially
the part with the elephant.

553
00:47:15,871 --> 00:47:18,238
That was so unexpected.

554
00:47:18,303 --> 00:47:20,442
I'm very impressed.

555
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:25,748
- Ah, what's his name?
- Bogey.

556
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:27,869
I know it's trite.

557
00:47:27,936 --> 00:47:30,870
No, no, Humphrey Bogart made
two great war movies.

558
00:47:30,943 --> 00:47:32,831
- Across the Pacific and...
- Tokyo Joe.

559
00:47:41,279 --> 00:47:43,134
All right, I'll take him.

560
00:47:43,199 --> 00:47:45,304
You will?

561
00:47:47,071 --> 00:47:49,624
Are you sure you can't
postpone this trip?

562
00:47:52,927 --> 00:47:54,782
Here, take him.

563
00:47:59,262 --> 00:48:00,757
Thanks.

564
00:48:01,407 --> 00:48:03,262
Take it easy.

565
00:48:07,999 --> 00:48:09,788
Bye, Bogey.

566
00:48:18,782 --> 00:48:20,724
- Come here!
- Huh?

567
00:48:20,798 --> 00:48:23,962
I'm gonna introduce you.
Come on!

568
00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:25,656
Introduce me to who?

569
00:48:25,727 --> 00:48:28,760
To the fella I'm gonna
give the dog to.

570
00:48:28,830 --> 00:48:32,125
That way you'll feel better.
It's my brother.

571
00:48:33,950 --> 00:48:36,252
All right, okay.
Bogey, come on.

572
00:48:36,350 --> 00:48:38,838
We're gonna go for a ride
with the lady.

573
00:48:38,942 --> 00:48:41,757
He's got a puppy
that swims.

574
00:48:43,902 --> 00:48:46,804
- What's your name?
- Teddy. Teddy Peppers.

575
00:48:46,878 --> 00:48:50,358
- Audrey.
- Hi, Audrey, and thanks.

576
00:49:08,606 --> 00:49:10,515
Ain't you gonna eat?

577
00:49:10,622 --> 00:49:13,753
Not unless Mr. Hopper does, and he
won't eat unless he sits at the table.

578
00:49:13,822 --> 00:49:16,539
What's the matter with these forks?
What kind are these?

579
00:49:16,573 --> 00:49:18,362
You're the loyal type?

580
00:49:18,430 --> 00:49:20,121
I'm Italian.

581
00:49:24,542 --> 00:49:27,062
All right, get up.

582
00:49:29,246 --> 00:49:31,221
Bring a plate.

583
00:49:31,294 --> 00:49:33,749
Get up, up, up.

584
00:49:33,822 --> 00:49:35,676
Sit down.

585
00:49:38,653 --> 00:49:40,628
You expecting somebody?

586
00:49:40,733 --> 00:49:42,740
- It's my half-sister.
- Get rid of her!

587
00:49:42,845 --> 00:49:46,423
She won't leave. She's coming by
to see if I'm okay.

588
00:49:46,493 --> 00:49:48,882
She's a nurse.

589
00:49:48,990 --> 00:49:51,608
She's got a man with her.
He's holdin' a dog.

590
00:49:52,701 --> 00:49:54,806
Another fuckin' dog?

591
00:50:07,933 --> 00:50:10,202
I can't go in there.

592
00:50:11,389 --> 00:50:14,836
Okay. You're all right.
Just wait here.

593
00:50:14,941 --> 00:50:17,526
We're gonna take a quick look inside.
What's the matter?

594
00:50:17,629 --> 00:50:20,149
I'm really sore right here.

595
00:50:21,181 --> 00:50:25,556
Oh, my God! Look at that!
I'm bruised!

596
00:50:25,629 --> 00:50:27,963
- What is that?
- Looks like a little prick...

597
00:50:28,029 --> 00:50:29,883
from an injection.

598
00:50:29,949 --> 00:50:31,803
What kind of injection?

599
00:50:31,869 --> 00:50:34,105
I don't know.
Miss Foxx, you're all right.

600
00:50:34,173 --> 00:50:36,028
Wait here. We'll be right out.

601
00:50:36,093 --> 00:50:39,126
We'll take you to the station
and have a doctor look at that.

602
00:50:39,197 --> 00:50:42,011
Try and remain calm.
Breathe.

603
00:51:18,524 --> 00:51:20,434
Jesus Christ!

604
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:22,874
Shot him point blank
in the head.

605
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:27,155
- Don't touch anything!
- I wasn't going to, all right?

606
00:51:27,227 --> 00:51:29,082
- Let's go.
- Hold up.

607
00:51:29,147 --> 00:51:31,798
- We're not wasting our time here.
- I'd like to look around.

608
00:51:31,868 --> 00:51:33,690
We're gonna let Homicide do it.

609
00:51:33,756 --> 00:51:35,610
Fuck anything up
in this crime scene...

610
00:51:35,676 --> 00:51:38,937
Defense will use it against Prosecution
when they catch the fuck that did this.

611
00:51:39,003 --> 00:51:41,076
Come on, Wes.

612
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:46,234
- Let's go.
- Don't put your hand on me.

613
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:48,503
- Get downstairs.
- Get your fucking hand off me!

614
00:51:48,603 --> 00:51:51,538
- Keep pushing me.
- What?

615
00:51:51,643 --> 00:51:54,010
- Keep pushing me.
- What are you guys fighting about?

616
00:51:55,995 --> 00:51:56,889
Oh, God!

617
00:52:00,987 --> 00:52:04,336
Miss Foxx, where exactly were you
when this happened?

618
00:52:04,412 --> 00:52:06,997
I was lying right next to him.

619
00:52:08,059 --> 00:52:09,946
I mean, I think I was.

620
00:52:11,547 --> 00:52:13,751
- You think?
- I don't remember anything.

621
00:52:15,739 --> 00:52:18,041
We were sleeping last night and...

622
00:52:18,107 --> 00:52:20,376
He's my ex-husband.

623
00:52:20,476 --> 00:52:24,250
We fell asleep,
and when I woke up he was...

624
00:52:24,315 --> 00:52:26,388
Roy was lying...
Oh, God!

625
00:52:28,731 --> 00:52:30,673
I'm a little confused here.

626
00:52:30,747 --> 00:52:33,397
You say you slept next to him,
but you didn't hear a shot?

627
00:52:33,467 --> 00:52:37,209
Maybe that's what the injection was.
Stuck it in her, then used a silencer.

628
00:52:37,275 --> 00:52:39,184
Who would do this?

629
00:52:39,259 --> 00:52:41,398
- Do you know anyone...
- Let's go downstairs.

630
00:52:56,603 --> 00:52:58,937
- Miss Foxx?
- Come on.

631
00:52:59,003 --> 00:53:01,042
- Do you smoke?
- No.

632
00:53:01,114 --> 00:53:03,929
- Did your ex-husband?
- No. Why?

633
00:53:03,994 --> 00:53:07,343
- Do you have friends who smoke?
- I don't allow it in my house.

634
00:53:07,418 --> 00:53:10,614
- Why are you asking me?
- Because I found this in your bedroom.

635
00:53:10,683 --> 00:53:14,031
- Where was it?
- On the floor behind a hamper.

636
00:53:14,106 --> 00:53:17,106
It must be the killers.
It must belong to them.

637
00:53:19,131 --> 00:53:21,105
Put it back where you found it,
you idiot!

638
00:53:21,946 --> 00:53:23,223
What?

639
00:53:23,931 --> 00:53:26,964
That evidence might be part of
the crime, and you're moving it around.

640
00:53:27,067 --> 00:53:28,976
Put it back!

641
00:53:38,778 --> 00:53:41,233
All right, it's back.

642
00:53:43,545 --> 00:53:46,360
- Could we get out of here?
- Yes.

643
00:53:49,657 --> 00:53:52,625
Did you hear that?
She said it belonged to "them."

644
00:53:52,697 --> 00:53:55,632
- What?
- She said it belonged to "them."

645
00:53:55,706 --> 00:53:58,455
- What are you talking about?
- I held up the smokes...

646
00:53:58,553 --> 00:54:01,521
and she said, "It must be the killers.
It must belong to them."

647
00:54:01,626 --> 00:54:04,757
- Why would she say "them"?
- It's a figure of speech.

648
00:54:04,825 --> 00:54:08,142
Like when you find your car stolen,
you say, "They stole it."

649
00:54:08,217 --> 00:54:11,000
Or someone breaks into your house,
you say, "They robbed me."

650
00:54:11,066 --> 00:54:12,920
It's just a figure of speech.

651
00:54:12,986 --> 00:54:16,117
Your wanna-be detective brain
is working overtime.

652
00:54:21,626 --> 00:54:23,797
Can you wait?
He'll be right down.

653
00:54:23,865 --> 00:54:27,509
- I'll go up.
- No, no. He wanted you to wait.

654
00:54:27,609 --> 00:54:30,958
- Susan, why are you acting so strange?
- I'm not acting strange.

655
00:54:31,065 --> 00:54:34,775
I don't think Allan's
going to want another dog.

656
00:54:34,841 --> 00:54:37,329
Where's the swimming puppy?
Can we let him in?

657
00:54:37,402 --> 00:54:39,791
Let's just wait until
Allan comes down.

658
00:54:39,865 --> 00:54:44,372
Why don't you guys come over here
and sit on the couch?

659
00:54:44,441 --> 00:54:47,343
Just over here.
Do you want something to drink?

660
00:54:47,417 --> 00:54:49,838
Oh, I would love a scotch.

661
00:54:49,913 --> 00:54:53,296
Sure. I think we've got some.
Is Glenlivet all right?

662
00:54:53,369 --> 00:54:55,541
- Perfect.
- Audrey?

663
00:54:55,609 --> 00:54:58,991
I'm fine. Susan,
I'm wondering about you.

664
00:55:01,881 --> 00:55:04,630
- That won't fit.
- Why? Because it's expensive.

665
00:55:04,696 --> 00:55:06,191
It won't fit you!

666
00:55:06,297 --> 00:55:10,039
Fuckin' liar! Lie to me again,
and I'll knock your teeth out.

667
00:55:10,137 --> 00:55:13,039
- It's a 44.
- Some in there are 40 regulars.

668
00:55:13,113 --> 00:55:15,317
Oh, yeah?
Show me one!

669
00:55:15,385 --> 00:55:17,240
Ow, Jesus!

670
00:55:25,016 --> 00:55:28,661
They're at the cleaners.
But that suit's not gonna fit you.

671
00:55:28,729 --> 00:55:31,347
Oh, shit! Look what
you've done to my door!

672
00:55:31,416 --> 00:55:33,303
I only... Ouch!

673
00:55:34,745 --> 00:55:36,752
I had them fitted last month!

674
00:55:38,264 --> 00:55:41,428
That suit's not going to fit you!
I had the waist custom-tailored.

675
00:55:41,496 --> 00:55:43,798
I have a 32-inch waist.

676
00:55:50,584 --> 00:55:52,591
I'll fit into them.

677
00:55:57,976 --> 00:56:00,529
How do you get kidney stones?

678
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:03,916
- Too much calcium oxalate.
- Oh, yeah.

679
00:56:04,024 --> 00:56:07,373
One of the nurses thinks
it's caused by stress.

680
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:09,553
Fuck, then I probably got them.

681
00:56:20,375 --> 00:56:22,709
What do you got to be
stressed-out about?

682
00:56:24,152 --> 00:56:27,796
Big house, all this money,
all this art.

683
00:56:28,856 --> 00:56:30,481
It's all relative.

684
00:56:30,551 --> 00:56:33,519
Oh, you're lonely.
It's tough being rich.

685
00:56:33,592 --> 00:56:38,228
You can't find someone to love you
for who you are and not for your money.

686
00:56:38,327 --> 00:56:40,367
I wasn't born with a silver spoon
in my mouth.

687
00:56:40,472 --> 00:56:44,727
I spent a large part of my childhood
being brought up in a trailer park.

688
00:56:44,824 --> 00:56:46,929
My father abandoned us.

689
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,902
My mother couldn't afford
to send me to college!

690
00:56:49,976 --> 00:56:51,863
I might be an asshole...

691
00:56:51,927 --> 00:56:54,829
but I've worked hard
to become one.

692
00:56:54,903 --> 00:56:58,198
Well, you definitely
achieved your goal.

693
00:56:59,223 --> 00:57:01,525
How much do they pay you
for a hit?

694
00:57:01,591 --> 00:57:04,373
Two thousand? Five thousand?

695
00:57:05,303 --> 00:57:07,245
Five thousand dollars?

696
00:57:07,319 --> 00:57:09,872
What do I look like,
an amateur?

697
00:57:12,471 --> 00:57:15,023
You look very professional.

698
00:57:20,535 --> 00:57:23,699
So you'll be at this number, Miss Foxx,
if we need to get in touch?

699
00:57:23,767 --> 00:57:27,149
Yeah, I'll be at my girlfriend's,
the one who's picking me up.

700
00:57:27,222 --> 00:57:30,157
If you wanna go anywhere else,
let us know.

701
00:57:30,231 --> 00:57:31,605
And don't worry.

702
00:57:32,823 --> 00:57:37,046
When will they have, you know,
my urine analyzed?

703
00:57:37,111 --> 00:57:39,249
- We should have the results...
- Could you help me out here?

704
00:57:39,350 --> 00:57:40,757
What'd I tell you?

705
00:57:41,846 --> 00:57:45,262
As the doctor said, we're almost
certain it was a sedative of some kind.

706
00:57:45,366 --> 00:57:47,886
We're gonna find out who did this,
I promise you.

707
00:57:47,958 --> 00:57:50,227
It's just all so weird.

708
00:57:50,295 --> 00:57:53,164
There she is.
There's my girlfriend.

709
00:57:53,239 --> 00:57:56,435
Miss Foxx, do you have to go back
to your place for any reason?

710
00:57:56,502 --> 00:57:59,372
No. I never want
to go back there again.

711
00:58:00,726 --> 00:58:02,930
And call me Becky.

712
00:58:05,014 --> 00:58:06,868
If you think of anything, Becky...

713
00:58:06,934 --> 00:58:10,229
anything at all that you think might
help us, I want you to give me a call.

714
00:58:10,294 --> 00:58:13,491
I'm putting my home number on the back.
Call me anytime.

715
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:16,307
Day or night.
Even if it's just to talk.

716
00:58:16,374 --> 00:58:18,065
Thanks.

717
00:58:21,270 --> 00:58:23,125
You guys have been great.

718
00:58:28,726 --> 00:58:31,475
You weren't coming on to her now,
were you, Doug?

719
00:58:31,541 --> 00:58:33,745
Now what do you think?

720
00:58:33,813 --> 00:58:37,391
She's one hell of an athlete.
I watched her compete on TV.

721
00:58:37,461 --> 00:58:40,309
Did she ever medal?
I don't follow skiing.

722
00:58:40,374 --> 00:58:42,446
No, she just missed.

723
00:58:42,517 --> 00:58:44,622
Came in fourth
in the last two Olympics.

724
00:58:50,293 --> 00:58:51,537
How did it go?

725
00:58:52,438 --> 00:58:54,543
"How did it go?"

726
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:57,167
How could you kill Roy,
in my house...

727
00:58:57,238 --> 00:58:59,539
in my bed,
with me sleeping next to him?

728
00:58:59,605 --> 00:59:01,710
You were supposed to shoot him
at his place.

729
00:59:01,781 --> 00:59:04,148
We didn't tell you
where we were gonna do it.

730
00:59:04,213 --> 00:59:07,279
Lee didn't want you to know
when or where it was gonna happen.

731
00:59:07,349 --> 00:59:09,259
That way you're out of it.
You can't be connected.

732
00:59:09,333 --> 00:59:10,609
Can't be connected?

733
00:59:10,677 --> 00:59:14,289
- I was three inches away from him!
- That's why they can't put it together.

734
00:59:16,277 --> 00:59:19,506
- Did Lee drop a pack of cigarettes?
- Why?

735
00:59:19,573 --> 00:59:21,483
Because they kept asking me
about them.

736
00:59:21,589 --> 00:59:24,207
Yes, they were planted.
I'm not gonna tell you anything more.

737
00:59:24,277 --> 00:59:26,165
The less you know, the better.

738
00:59:26,261 --> 00:59:29,195
They asked; you answered honestly. You
don't know anybody who smokes them.

739
00:59:29,269 --> 00:59:30,927
That's the way
it's supposed to go.

740
00:59:32,117 --> 00:59:34,670
Lee knows what he's doing.
He's protecting you.

741
00:59:34,741 --> 00:59:36,116
Were you there too?

742
00:59:36,181 --> 00:59:39,442
Where's the money?
Lee wants you to bring the money.

743
00:59:39,509 --> 00:59:41,810
Well, we have
a little problem there.

744
00:59:41,876 --> 00:59:43,916
- What problem?
- It's in my house.

745
00:59:43,989 --> 00:59:47,819
- In your house?
- In a safe in the closet of my house!

746
00:59:47,925 --> 00:59:50,259
- Our 30,000 is in your closet?
- That's right.

747
00:59:50,324 --> 00:59:53,041
- How can you leave it lying around?
- Don't yell at me!

748
00:59:53,109 --> 00:59:55,443
You know, I'm just curious.

749
00:59:55,509 --> 00:59:59,022
This friend of yours who's buried
in the veterans' cemetery...

750
00:59:59,093 --> 01:00:01,002
I don't want to talk about him.

751
01:00:01,076 --> 01:00:02,931
I don't mean to be nosy.

752
01:00:04,341 --> 01:00:06,675
I just know what it takes
to get in there.

753
01:00:07,829 --> 01:00:11,920
There's a lot of heroes buried
in that place. Was your friend a hero?

754
01:00:14,805 --> 01:00:16,627
He wouldn't have
considered himself one.

755
01:00:17,652 --> 01:00:19,856
- You lose him in Vietnam?
- Yes.

756
01:00:19,956 --> 01:00:22,990
Now I don't really want
to talk about it anymore.

757
01:00:23,092 --> 01:00:25,514
Okay. Next subject.

758
01:00:33,076 --> 01:00:34,669
What are you gonna do?

759
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:38,056
I'm going to get our money. It's time
for us to say good-bye to California.

760
01:00:38,132 --> 01:00:39,987
We'd like to take
our money with us.

761
01:00:40,052 --> 01:00:42,354
But those detectives
are up at the house.

762
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:45,071
- No problem.
- What are you gonna do?

763
01:00:47,092 --> 01:00:49,197
I'm going to get our money.

764
01:00:49,268 --> 01:00:50,675
Then Helga and I...

765
01:00:50,739 --> 01:00:54,154
will say good-bye until you get
the check from his insurance company.

766
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:57,609
Then you'll contact us,
and we'll divide it in half.

767
01:00:57,715 --> 01:00:59,854
- Get packed. Have everything in the car.
- Okay, baby.

768
01:00:59,924 --> 01:01:02,258
I wish I knew you were
gonna kill Roy in my house.

769
01:01:02,323 --> 01:01:04,331
I would have wanted to discuss it.

770
01:01:04,404 --> 01:01:06,575
I've already been
through this with her.

771
01:01:11,155 --> 01:01:13,097
Look, darlin', it's over.

772
01:01:14,131 --> 01:01:16,040
There's no turnin' back.

773
01:01:20,819 --> 01:01:22,194
Stay calm.

774
01:01:23,379 --> 01:01:27,787
Follow the plan and everything
will happen as it should.

775
01:01:30,387 --> 01:01:33,900
Is there someone else in on this,
somebody I should know about?

776
01:01:38,387 --> 01:01:40,525
Why don't you tell me the truth?

777
01:01:40,595 --> 01:01:42,450
Why do you keep torturing me?

778
01:01:42,515 --> 01:01:45,679
Just tell her, Lee.
What's the difference?

779
01:02:02,867 --> 01:02:06,479
Since you've been such a good sport,
I'm gonna put your mind at ease...

780
01:02:06,547 --> 01:02:08,434
so you can sleep at night.

781
01:02:08,498 --> 01:02:10,408
Yes, there is
another person involved.

782
01:02:10,482 --> 01:02:14,312
He'll take the fall, but don't worry
about him talking because he's dead.

783
01:02:14,387 --> 01:02:16,874
Everything will lead back to him,
and it will appear as if...

784
01:02:16,946 --> 01:02:20,427
he was hired to kill your ex-husband
because of a drug deal gone bad.

785
01:02:22,290 --> 01:02:24,265
Now, you know almost everything.

786
01:02:28,562 --> 01:02:30,220
What else is there to know?

787
01:02:32,018 --> 01:02:33,425
Becky.

788
01:02:35,219 --> 01:02:36,560
Becky.

789
01:02:38,546 --> 01:02:41,962
We have to keep
some secrets from you, don't we?

790
01:02:42,034 --> 01:02:45,198
In case you forget to call us
when you get that insurance check.

791
01:02:45,266 --> 01:02:46,641
Exactly.

792
01:02:54,834 --> 01:02:56,241
He's coming.

793
01:03:02,642 --> 01:03:04,584
Everybody, sit down.

794
01:03:04,690 --> 01:03:06,577
What's going on?

795
01:03:06,674 --> 01:03:08,529
This guy's holding us hostage.

796
01:03:08,625 --> 01:03:10,000
Who is he?

797
01:03:10,066 --> 01:03:13,327
He won't tell us his name,
but I know him from somewhere.

798
01:03:13,394 --> 01:03:16,044
Everybody shut up.
Didn't I tell you to sit down?

799
01:03:20,242 --> 01:03:21,486
Be smart.

800
01:03:24,434 --> 01:03:25,863
Here's the situation.

801
01:03:25,938 --> 01:03:28,393
When it gets dark,
we're all gonna take a ride.

802
01:03:28,466 --> 01:03:32,240
- Not me! I have to lay down!
- Then you'll lay down in the trunk!

803
01:03:32,337 --> 01:03:35,152
- Goin' where?
- You'll see when we get there.

804
01:03:35,217 --> 01:03:37,389
I don't wanna shoot nobody...

805
01:03:39,026 --> 01:03:41,197
but I will if it becomes
a necessity.

806
01:03:41,265 --> 01:03:43,632
If everybody behaves,
nobody's gonna get hurt.

807
01:03:43,697 --> 01:03:45,552
Miss Pollutzo,
you're gonna drive.

808
01:03:45,617 --> 01:03:48,552
- Who's Pollutzo?
- That's my real last name.

809
01:03:48,625 --> 01:03:51,244
- How does he know?
- She told him.

810
01:03:51,314 --> 01:03:55,274
She's been with me for eight years.
I never knew she had another last name.

811
01:03:55,345 --> 01:03:58,509
He meets her, and five seconds later,
they're bosom buddies!

812
01:03:58,577 --> 01:04:01,447
- What are you doin'?
- I'm just taking some notes.

813
01:04:01,521 --> 01:04:05,034
- He's a television writer.
- Put the fuckin' pen down!

814
01:04:05,137 --> 01:04:06,697
Could you talk slower?

815
01:04:07,505 --> 01:04:10,222
- Don't!
- He's think I'm fuckin' around.

816
01:04:10,289 --> 01:04:12,874
You better tell him
I'm not fuckin' around, Susan.

817
01:04:16,977 --> 01:04:19,082
He's not fuckin' around.

818
01:04:19,153 --> 01:04:20,680
"He's not"...

819
01:04:21,905 --> 01:04:23,814
- Gimme back the pen.
- Sit the fuck down!

820
01:04:23,889 --> 01:04:25,831
- Gimme that back.
- Shut up!

821
01:04:25,905 --> 01:04:27,563
Sit the fuck down!

822
01:04:27,633 --> 01:04:29,542
Shut those fuckin' dogs up!

823
01:05:44,368 --> 01:05:45,774
Fore!

824
01:06:01,327 --> 01:06:02,985
Goddamn it!

825
01:06:06,031 --> 01:06:07,940
I've had it with you assholes.

826
01:06:08,015 --> 01:06:11,114
That is the third time
you've broken my fuckin' window!

827
01:06:11,183 --> 01:06:13,092
Whoa!

828
01:06:13,167 --> 01:06:15,142
Get out from behind that tree.

829
01:06:15,247 --> 01:06:17,451
Come out with your hands up!
I'm a police officer!

830
01:06:17,519 --> 01:06:20,203
It wasn't me. It was him.

831
01:06:20,271 --> 01:06:21,700
- Walk out!
- Where you going?

832
01:06:21,807 --> 01:06:24,840
- Walk out!
- Okay, I'm comin'.

833
01:06:27,407 --> 01:06:28,836
Don't shoot.

834
01:06:53,870 --> 01:06:55,463
Fuckin' hack.

835
01:09:24,812 --> 01:09:26,700
Son of a bitch.

836
01:09:31,628 --> 01:09:33,635
Son of a bitch.

837
01:09:37,324 --> 01:09:39,396
Son of a bitch!

838
01:09:53,260 --> 01:09:55,202
Aren't you and Lee engaged?

839
01:09:55,308 --> 01:09:56,617
Yeah.

840
01:09:57,772 --> 01:09:59,147
Why?

841
01:09:59,212 --> 01:10:01,929
It doesn't bother him
that you slept with Roy?

842
01:10:01,996 --> 01:10:04,232
I didn't sleep with Roy.

843
01:10:04,299 --> 01:10:06,885
And Lee believes that...
that you just fooled around?

844
01:10:08,076 --> 01:10:10,465
That really bothers you,
doesn't it?

845
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:14,980
No, I'll tell you what bothers me.
That he's gonna murder those detectives.

846
01:10:15,052 --> 01:10:17,638
- What do you care about them?
- Roy was one thing.

847
01:10:17,708 --> 01:10:21,024
He was a shit.
He treated me like shit. He was a rat.

848
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:24,744
He cheated on me our whole marriage,
and then he sued me for alimony.

849
01:10:24,811 --> 01:10:28,226
I was paying him alimony.
Did you know that? No.

850
01:10:28,332 --> 01:10:31,049
I don't give a shit about Roy.
But those detectives?

851
01:10:31,116 --> 01:10:34,377
They were nice to me. I don't want to be
a part of them being killed.

852
01:10:34,444 --> 01:10:37,127
Then you shouldn't have left
our money in your closet.

853
01:10:37,195 --> 01:10:40,807
How was I supposed to know
you were gonna shoot Roy in my house?

854
01:10:40,876 --> 01:10:43,778
- Don't raise your voice at me!
- Can't you call it off?

855
01:10:45,420 --> 01:10:47,459
Now lower your voice,
you little bitch.

856
01:10:50,187 --> 01:10:51,714
What did you call me?

857
01:10:52,619 --> 01:10:54,048
A bitch?

858
01:10:55,627 --> 01:10:57,537
Roy put up with a lot of shit too.

859
01:10:57,611 --> 01:11:01,408
You were never supportive of his career.
Yours always came first.

860
01:11:01,515 --> 01:11:04,995
You made your husband feel like shit.
That's why he cheated on you.

861
01:11:05,099 --> 01:11:06,692
He deserved alimony.

862
01:11:08,747 --> 01:11:12,576
You liked him.
You really liked him.

863
01:11:14,282 --> 01:11:17,479
Of course I liked him.
Roy was a likable guy.

864
01:11:20,011 --> 01:11:21,920
He knew how to treat a woman.

865
01:11:25,771 --> 01:11:28,934
How would you know?
You were never there.

866
01:11:29,003 --> 01:11:31,304
You were always too busy
training for your next event.

867
01:11:33,099 --> 01:11:35,848
That's why your husband
went to other women.

868
01:11:35,914 --> 01:11:38,281
His little "worm"...

869
01:11:38,346 --> 01:11:40,550
couldn't even satisfy him in bed.

870
01:11:55,338 --> 01:11:57,640
What the hell
are they doin' up there?

871
01:11:59,850 --> 01:12:02,021
Maybe that's how they make love
in Tarzana.

872
01:12:40,618 --> 01:12:41,862
You want walls?

873
01:13:15,305 --> 01:13:16,898
You bitch!

874
01:13:22,633 --> 01:13:24,575
Maybe she'll give you
skiing lessons.

875
01:13:26,217 --> 01:13:28,322
This girl is in great shape.

876
01:13:28,393 --> 01:13:30,662
She ought to be.
Look at all this equipment.

877
01:13:30,729 --> 01:13:34,406
In her bedroom.
Think she's a little obsessed?

878
01:13:34,473 --> 01:13:37,702
Hey, that's what it takes to win.
You gotta be obsessed.

879
01:13:38,761 --> 01:13:41,827
I admire her. She never won,
but she keeps on trying.

880
01:13:43,913 --> 01:13:45,920
You know what bothers me
about all this?

881
01:13:46,985 --> 01:13:49,952
This job is so clean,
so professional...

882
01:13:50,025 --> 01:13:51,934
but he leaves
an empty cigarette pack.

883
01:13:52,009 --> 01:13:55,784
I know we're Valley detectives,
but how stupid does he think we are?

884
01:13:56,968 --> 01:13:58,790
Unless he doesn't care.

885
01:14:09,352 --> 01:14:12,221
- You hear something?
- What?

886
01:14:12,328 --> 01:14:14,215
I'm gonna check downstairs.

887
01:14:47,303 --> 01:14:48,580
Carla?

888
01:15:41,415 --> 01:15:42,789
Hello?

889
01:15:45,319 --> 01:15:46,595
Hello.

890
01:15:48,615 --> 01:15:50,470
You guys up there?

891
01:15:52,199 --> 01:15:54,981
- Can I help you?
- Hi.

892
01:15:55,046 --> 01:15:57,501
I'm Van Nuys vice.

893
01:15:57,574 --> 01:16:00,706
My partner and I discovered
this crime scene this morning.

894
01:16:00,775 --> 01:16:01,854
Right.

895
01:16:02,982 --> 01:16:06,757
I thought I'd drop by
and see how things were going.

896
01:16:06,822 --> 01:16:10,270
- We're kind of busy right now.
- Right. Listen.

897
01:16:10,343 --> 01:16:13,310
I was curious.
You know that cigarette pack?

898
01:16:13,383 --> 01:16:15,292
- Did you find that?
- Yes, I did.

899
01:16:15,366 --> 01:16:18,214
- Good work.
- Well, thank you.

900
01:16:18,279 --> 01:16:21,148
Thanks.
It's interesting, actually.

901
01:16:21,255 --> 01:16:25,794
When I asked Miss Foxx about it,
her response was...

902
01:16:25,863 --> 01:16:29,605
"It must be the killers.
It must belong to them."

903
01:16:34,182 --> 01:16:35,459
What's your point?

904
01:16:36,806 --> 01:16:40,068
I think that Becky Foxx
might be in on this.

905
01:16:41,958 --> 01:16:43,965
- Really.
- Yes.

906
01:16:44,038 --> 01:16:46,111
Maybe she hired the hit men.

907
01:16:47,302 --> 01:16:48,512
I know.

908
01:16:48,582 --> 01:16:52,772
It sounds farfetched, but she
and the victim were recently divorced.

909
01:16:52,870 --> 01:16:57,147
Maybe that's something to check into.
Maybe the divorce was a messy thing.

910
01:16:57,254 --> 01:17:00,515
But the fact that she said "them,"
it bothers me.

911
01:17:00,581 --> 01:17:04,062
- What do you think?
- Interesting.

912
01:17:04,134 --> 01:17:07,516
It's reaching,
but worth consideration.

913
01:17:09,766 --> 01:17:12,865
Listen, would you be willing to do
a little legwork for us?

914
01:17:14,021 --> 01:17:17,469
Absolutely. You name it.
Anything. What do you need?

915
01:17:17,542 --> 01:17:19,451
I have to drive down
to the station...

916
01:17:19,525 --> 01:17:21,859
see if the lab has an I.D. Print
of the cigarette pack.

917
01:17:21,926 --> 01:17:24,064
Maybe you wanna ride along.
We could talk on the way.

918
01:17:24,166 --> 01:17:26,304
Maybe you could find out
who that divorce lawyer was.

919
01:17:26,405 --> 01:17:28,772
And I should check into
the insurance policies.

920
01:17:28,837 --> 01:17:31,074
A lot of times these couples
get divorced...

921
01:17:31,142 --> 01:17:34,273
and don't change the beneficiaries
on their policies right away.

922
01:17:34,341 --> 01:17:36,381
Good idea. Come on.

923
01:17:36,453 --> 01:17:37,980
Lee.

924
01:17:44,261 --> 01:17:47,295
Becky shot me.
That bitch shot me.

925
01:17:48,357 --> 01:17:49,634
Help!

926
01:17:51,845 --> 01:17:54,082
Let's go. Come on.

927
01:17:57,157 --> 01:17:59,012
I don't think so.

928
01:18:01,797 --> 01:18:04,830
Are you kiddin'?
You think I'm gonna shoot you?

929
01:18:04,900 --> 01:18:07,388
Go ahead. Shoot me.

930
01:18:08,421 --> 01:18:11,323
- Shoot me.
- Are you fucking crazy?

931
01:18:11,397 --> 01:18:13,982
I think he's suicidal.

932
01:18:14,052 --> 01:18:16,671
We all have our flaws.

933
01:18:16,741 --> 01:18:19,359
I had a bad feeling about you
right from the beginning.

934
01:18:21,028 --> 01:18:24,738
- What if I shoot her?
- You harm her, and I'll kill you...

935
01:18:24,804 --> 01:18:26,909
and I'm not fuckin' around!

936
01:18:26,980 --> 01:18:30,296
Point that gun somewhere else,
or you'll be sorry.

937
01:18:32,517 --> 01:18:33,858
You'll come with me?

938
01:18:34,949 --> 01:18:37,316
If you give me your word,
once we're safely out of the Valley...

939
01:18:37,381 --> 01:18:38,722
you'll let everybody go.

940
01:18:38,789 --> 01:18:41,920
You'd take this loser's word?
You can't believe him!

941
01:18:41,988 --> 01:18:43,963
I'll take his word over yours.

942
01:18:44,036 --> 01:18:46,589
It's been my experience,
more often than not...

943
01:18:46,660 --> 01:18:48,864
that a loser has more honor
than a winner.

944
01:18:51,940 --> 01:18:55,552
- I give you my word.
- Your word of honor?

945
01:18:58,564 --> 01:18:59,741
You got it.

946
01:19:01,540 --> 01:19:02,947
Come on, Bogey.

947
01:19:07,844 --> 01:19:10,714
I'm telling you, there's not
enough room in the car.

948
01:19:13,124 --> 01:19:15,841
Don't you start with me,
you little selfish prick...

949
01:19:15,908 --> 01:19:17,915
because you
I don't give a shit about!

950
01:19:17,988 --> 01:19:21,152
I can't go.
I'm in a lot of pain!

951
01:19:21,220 --> 01:19:23,391
Doctors compare the pain
of passing a kidney stone...

952
01:19:23,460 --> 01:19:25,697
to a woman
giving birth to a baby!

953
01:19:25,764 --> 01:19:27,869
Bouncing in the car will hurt.

954
01:19:27,940 --> 01:19:30,111
I've got to take painkillers
and lay down!

955
01:19:30,180 --> 01:19:33,049
Tell him, Audrey. You're a nurse.
Make him understand!

956
01:19:38,596 --> 01:19:40,930
He's out of pain now.
Let's go.

957
01:19:41,028 --> 01:19:42,882
Audrey, come on.

958
01:19:44,260 --> 01:19:46,780
As soon as I'm out of the Valley,
I'll let you all go.

959
01:19:46,852 --> 01:19:48,859
I really didn't
want to have to hit him.

960
01:19:48,931 --> 01:19:52,346
You lost your temper.
Sometimes that happens.

961
01:19:52,419 --> 01:19:55,354
When I was a kid,
once I got so mad at my father...

962
01:19:55,427 --> 01:19:57,532
'cause he didn't come to my...

963
01:19:57,603 --> 01:19:59,458
What didn't he come to?

964
01:19:59,523 --> 01:20:01,433
To my piano recital.

965
01:20:01,508 --> 01:20:03,417
I got so mad I...

966
01:20:05,859 --> 01:20:08,706
I set fire
to his favorite chair.

967
01:20:08,803 --> 01:20:11,618
Did you really?
Good for you.

968
01:20:11,683 --> 01:20:13,057
What's your name?

969
01:20:14,147 --> 01:20:15,423
Dosmo.

970
01:20:16,643 --> 01:20:19,774
- You still play the piano?
- Nah, I gave it up.

971
01:20:19,843 --> 01:20:22,527
Well, it's never too late
to start again.

972
01:20:22,595 --> 01:20:24,602
Let's get the hell outta here.

973
01:20:25,571 --> 01:20:27,065
You, in the back.

974
01:20:28,579 --> 01:20:30,008
In the front.

975
01:20:39,202 --> 01:20:41,984
- Am I dying?
- Is Becky dead?

976
01:20:45,347 --> 01:20:48,194
She ran. I shot at her.
I don't know if I hit her.

977
01:20:51,202 --> 01:20:52,763
It hurts.

978
01:20:53,858 --> 01:20:55,516
Please take me to a hospital.

979
01:21:02,083 --> 01:21:03,544
What are you doing?

980
01:21:04,578 --> 01:21:06,269
This is a tough decision for me.

981
01:21:07,970 --> 01:21:09,214
"Decision"?

982
01:21:10,434 --> 01:21:11,808
What decision?

983
01:21:23,170 --> 01:21:27,512
Honey, I love you. There's no other way.
I can't take you to a hospital.

984
01:21:27,586 --> 01:21:28,928
Understand?

985
01:21:37,186 --> 01:21:38,713
Give me a minute.

986
01:21:41,634 --> 01:21:44,219
You give everybody else a minute.

987
01:21:59,586 --> 01:22:03,448
Baby, the wound,
it's not as bad as it looks.

988
01:22:03,522 --> 01:22:05,431
No, you've lost too much blood.

989
01:22:06,402 --> 01:22:07,831
You're definitely dying.

990
01:22:10,817 --> 01:22:13,206
I'm doing you a favor
by finishing you off.

991
01:22:28,001 --> 01:22:30,106
Honey, just tell me the truth.

992
01:22:31,617 --> 01:22:33,112
I gotta know.

993
01:22:34,849 --> 01:22:36,704
Did you sleep with Roy?

994
01:22:41,665 --> 01:22:43,575
How can you ask me that?

995
01:22:45,761 --> 01:22:47,649
How can you ask me that now?

996
01:22:50,272 --> 01:22:52,127
You're right. I'm sorry.

997
01:22:57,185 --> 01:22:59,454
I gotta get outta here.

998
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:02,270
Just for the record,
I think you did sleep with him.

999
01:23:04,289 --> 01:23:06,460
Goddamn automatics!

1000
01:23:06,529 --> 01:23:08,733
Always jam!

1001
01:23:11,169 --> 01:23:12,543
Hold on a second.

1002
01:23:19,009 --> 01:23:20,951
You don't mind
if I borrow this, do you?

1003
01:23:41,536 --> 01:23:42,584
Hey, baby.

1004
01:23:51,968 --> 01:23:53,724
Help!

1005
01:23:54,752 --> 01:23:59,029
- Where we going?
- I'm gonna drop everybody in Pasadena.

1006
01:23:59,104 --> 01:24:01,111
Then you're gonna go
back to Brooklyn?

1007
01:24:01,184 --> 01:24:03,191
What's this?

1008
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:05,789
- Stop the car!
- Shut up!

1009
01:24:05,855 --> 01:24:08,376
- Stop the car!
- Keep goin'!

1010
01:24:08,448 --> 01:24:10,357
I'm a nurse.
I have to get out of the car!

1011
01:24:10,432 --> 01:24:13,083
- Shut up and just...
- Let her out.

1012
01:24:17,343 --> 01:24:20,540
- What happened?
- She came out of the bushes.

1013
01:24:21,856 --> 01:24:23,710
All right. It's okay.
Try to relax.

1014
01:24:23,776 --> 01:24:26,590
Just try to relax. That's it.
You can hold onto my hand.

1015
01:24:29,088 --> 01:24:30,975
That's it.
Everything's gonna be okay.

1016
01:24:32,351 --> 01:24:35,351
- What kind of language is that?
- Sounds Swedish.

1017
01:24:46,719 --> 01:24:48,694
Try to relax.
Everything's gonna be okay.

1018
01:24:48,767 --> 01:24:50,556
She's not gonna make it...

1019
01:24:50,623 --> 01:24:52,565
- Get out.
- What's going on?

1020
01:24:52,671 --> 01:24:55,126
- I need the car.
- I'm driving you.

1021
01:24:58,207 --> 01:24:59,832
Thank you, Teddy.

1022
01:24:59,903 --> 01:25:01,943
There you go.

1023
01:25:02,015 --> 01:25:03,990
Everything's gonna be okay.

1024
01:25:06,239 --> 01:25:07,994
All right. That's it.

1025
01:25:08,063 --> 01:25:09,972
Try to breathe.

1026
01:25:10,047 --> 01:25:13,014
That's a girl. Just relax.

1027
01:25:56,574 --> 01:25:58,232
Get the fuck down!

1028
01:25:58,334 --> 01:25:59,414
Down!

1029
01:26:06,206 --> 01:26:07,700
Get behind the car.

1030
01:26:09,758 --> 01:26:11,351
Stay the fuck down!

1031
01:26:21,406 --> 01:26:22,650
Go on.

1032
01:26:22,718 --> 01:26:26,646
Save him, 'cause the next shot's
gonna blow his brains out.

1033
01:26:26,717 --> 01:26:30,012
- Who is he?
- I'm a police officer.

1034
01:26:30,078 --> 01:26:31,507
Stay where you are.

1035
01:26:31,614 --> 01:26:33,686
Do not jeopardize
your safety for me.

1036
01:26:38,878 --> 01:26:40,852
Shoot a guy when he's down?

1037
01:26:40,925 --> 01:26:42,299
Where's your guts?

1038
01:26:51,422 --> 01:26:54,171
You can save him.
Go get him.

1039
01:26:55,293 --> 01:26:57,911
Fuck him.
I'm comin' to get you.

1040
01:27:00,893 --> 01:27:02,802
Come get me, Dumbo.

1041
01:27:02,909 --> 01:27:05,243
Stay where you are.
That's an order.

1042
01:27:08,445 --> 01:27:11,195
You motherfuckin' cowardly prick!

1043
01:27:15,933 --> 01:27:17,339
Come get me, Dumbo.

1044
01:27:30,332 --> 01:27:32,242
Dosmo, don't!
He'll kill you!

1045
01:27:58,396 --> 01:27:59,858
Boo!

1046
01:28:07,548 --> 01:28:08,825
Time's up.

1047
01:28:29,532 --> 01:28:31,387
You're a tricky son of a bitch.

1048
01:28:32,252 --> 01:28:33,845
You almost got away with it...

1049
01:28:33,916 --> 01:28:37,014
but that's your life,
isn't it, Dosmo?

1050
01:28:37,116 --> 01:28:39,538
Almost, but not quite.

1051
01:29:24,699 --> 01:29:26,226
Come on, Dosmo.

1052
01:29:32,379 --> 01:29:34,834
Dosmo, hurry!

1053
01:29:36,827 --> 01:29:38,104
Go.

1054
01:29:55,098 --> 01:29:56,953
Thank you.

1055
01:29:59,034 --> 01:30:00,463
Thank you.

1056
01:30:13,530 --> 01:30:14,937
You want this?

1057
01:30:20,954 --> 01:30:22,164
Nah.

1058
01:32:02,649 --> 01:32:04,558
You know, you do know me.

1059
01:32:05,689 --> 01:32:08,439
From Polly's Pizza
in Studio City.

1060
01:32:08,505 --> 01:32:09,715
You knew?

1061
01:32:09,784 --> 01:32:12,719
I realized it when you were cooking,
but I didn't want to say anything.

1062
01:32:12,793 --> 01:32:14,702
I didn't want to embarrass you.

1063
01:32:31,001 --> 01:32:32,408
You know...

1064
01:32:34,872 --> 01:32:39,761
this could be seed money
to open up a pizzeria in Brooklyn.

1065
01:32:39,832 --> 01:32:41,294
- Dosmo?
- What?

1066
01:32:44,697 --> 01:32:46,704
There's just one thing
that bothers me.

1067
01:32:46,776 --> 01:32:49,525
It's been bothering me
since we met.

1068
01:32:49,592 --> 01:32:53,586
Can I do something?
Don't get mad. Just try it.

1069
01:32:53,688 --> 01:32:54,866
What?

1070
01:32:58,712 --> 01:33:01,330
- Give me that!
- You really look better without it.

1071
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:03,472
Don't ever do that again.

1072
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:07,067
