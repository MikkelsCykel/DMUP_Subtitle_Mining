<i>My parents were born
into the good life.</i>

2
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:06,191
<i>Old money, blue blooded,
society sweethearts</i>

3
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:08,902
- Are you hoping for a boy or a girl?
- We'll be happy with whatever we have.

4
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:12,698
<i>Having played host to kings and queens
and other powers that be,</i>

5
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:16,451
<i>they were used to gracing
the pages of the society columns</i>

6
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:19,454
<i>So they welcomed
the attention...</i>

7
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:23,750
<i>On what they supposed would be
the happiest day of their lives.</i>

8
00:01:24,877 --> 00:01:26,336
Hang in there.
Hold on honey, you can do it.

9
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:30,090
Oh, my God!
I want to be sick! Oh, my God!

10
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:48,650
<i>But local legend had it</i>

11
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:52,112
<i>that a curse was put
on the Willhern family</i>

12
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,783
<i>When my great, great,
great grandfather Ralph...</i>

13
00:01:57,701 --> 00:02:01,455
<i>had a fling with a lowly
servant girl... Clara.</i>

14
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:05,125
<i>Who was soon eating
for two.</i>

15
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:09,296
<i>When he told his family of his plans
to marry Clara</i>

16
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:13,884
<i>He realised how silly
he'd been</i>

17
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:17,221
<i>Clara was after all
just a servant girl...</i>

18
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:19,598
<i>... and prone to rashes.</i>

19
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:23,060
<i>Sir Ralph married someone
more suitable.</i>

20
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:26,730
<i>And Clara...
fell off a cliff.</i>

21
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:31,902
<i>That night Clara's mother -
the town witch -</i>

22
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:34,196
<i>showed up on the
Wilhern lawn</i>

23
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:37,866
<i>determined to give these blue bloods
a taste of their own medicine.</i>

24
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:39,493
<i>She scattered about animal guts</i>

25
00:02:39,535 --> 00:02:44,748
<i>and commanded that the next Wilhern
daughter be born with the face of a pig.</i>

26
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:47,543
And only when one
of your own

27
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:51,004
kind claims this daughter as their own
'till death do they part'

28
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:53,423
will the curse be broken.

29
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:01,932
<i>Time passed,</i>

30
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:05,978
<i>and as luck would have it</i>

31
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,939
<i>the next five Wilhern brides</i>

32
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:11,942
<i>gave birth to all sons...</i>

33
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:15,696
<i>who fathered all sons...
who fathered all sons</i>

34
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:18,532
<i>... who fathered all sons.</i>

35
00:03:20,284 --> 00:03:25,956
<i>Finally, born to Ella and Leonard
Hugh Wilhern... a daughter.</i>

36
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:28,959
<i>A century of worry
for nothing.</i>

37
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,003
<i>Of course, what they didn't know</i>

38
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:34,464
<i>then was that Ella hadn't actually
given birth to a Wilhern.</i>

39
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:37,509
<i>She had given birth to... a Jones.</i>

40
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:43,223
<i>Which means that the first born
Wilhern girl...</i>

41
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:48,061
<i>... was me.</i>

42
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:15,047
Penelope.
Dear, sweet Penelope

43
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:18,050
I'd given up all hope

44
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,344
of ever finding a woman
who truly understands me.

45
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:24,932
I had given up all hope that is...
until I met you.

46
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:28,519
<i>I knew it.
He's the one.</i>

47
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:30,479
He just might be.

48
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:32,356
<i>You see...</i>

49
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:36,318
...like you, I felt imprisoned
most of my life.

50
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:44,034
Really?
...By what?

51
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,328
Your good looks
and your good name?

52
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,788
Yes, exactly.

53
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:51,750
- No one ever seems able to see past that.
- No one.

54
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:54,127
And Penelope.

55
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:57,714
Dear, sweet Penelope...

56
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,758
curse or no curse,

57
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,886
if I am more
than my name and my face...

58
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,849
well, then, surely you are
more than yours?

59
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:10,727
Let me in.

60
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,233
Penelope, let me in.

61
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:19,570
No!

62
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,071
Hi.

63
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:23,031
What...?

64
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,325
Help me! Help me!

65
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:29,788
She's a pig!

66
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:33,667
She's a killer pig!

67
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:36,253
Help me!
Somebody help!

68
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:39,882
Why, Penelope?
Why?

69
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:42,301
I'm not the one who ran mother.

70
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:47,014
Well, of course they run dear when you
spring yourself at them like that.

71
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:49,683
Do you think I showed your father
my mole on our third date?

72
00:05:49,725 --> 00:05:54,521
No dear, no. I had the good sense to wait
until after we were married.

73
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:56,273
I didn't show him my mole, mother.
I showed him my face.

74
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:14,333
Mom.

75
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:20,047
Oh, sweetheart.

76
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,800
He really liked you.

77
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:26,553
No, Mum, he really didn't.

78
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:30,724
He didn't like your nose, that's what he
didn't like. You're not your nose.

79
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:33,268
But, it... it is my nose.

80
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:36,980
No! It's your great, great,
great grandfathers nose.

81
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,609
On your father's side.
He did this to you... to us.

82
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:44,655
But you are not your nose.
You are not you.

83
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:46,657
You're, you're, you're...

84
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:51,745
somebody else inside just
waiting to come out.

85
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,957
<i>I had been reminded
over the years</i>

86
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:57,584
<i>that I was not the
only victim of the curse.</i>

87
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:02,005
<i>For starters along with my birth came
the knowledge of Aunt Ella's affair.</i>

88
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:10,931
Damn you, Ella!

89
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:19,606
<i>Even so no one suffered more
than my mother.</i>

90
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,985
- These things happen all the time.
- To who?

91
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:26,071
Did you know some children
are born with gills?

92
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:28,574
Gills, sweetheart,
like on a fish.

93
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:33,287
- So, can you cut it off?
- Strangest thing.

94
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:37,958
But the carotid artery appears to run
directly through the nose.

95
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,377
Or 'snout', as the case may be.

96
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,297
Making any attempt at removal
unfeasible.

97
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:45,048
The, caro... caro... what's that?

98
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:48,302
What's he saying, Franklin?
What, what's he saying?

99
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:53,307
She would die, sweetheart.
He is saying she would die.

100
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:56,643
I'm sorry.
The snout stays.

101
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,061
You...

102
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:01,648
Oh... that's not true.

103
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:07,321
<i>My mother meant well
She always meant well</i>

104
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:10,991
<i>And always did what she thought
best to protect me.</i>

105
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,076
<i>First, from reporters.</i>

106
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:14,870
What are you?

107
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,081
Ow, my eye!

108
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:23,003
<i>But with the public demanding to see the
face that had caused so much trouble.</i>

109
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:26,965
<i>My mother did what any
loving mother would do.</i>

110
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:29,343
<i>She faked my death.</i>

111
00:08:29,468 --> 00:08:33,639
Earth to earth
ashes to ashes. Dust to dust.

112
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:35,933
<i>And had me cremated.</i>

113
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:39,895
<i>So with the public left to mourn
with my tragic passing.</i>

114
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:43,232
<i>And with me safely hidden away
from the outside world.</i>

115
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:49,112
<i>Now she need only worry about
protecting me from my father.</i>

116
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:52,699
<i>Who was having trouble adapting
to the new morning menu.</i>

117
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:54,993
Why can't I have
bacon?

118
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,079
Because you love
oatmeal.

119
00:08:57,079 --> 00:08:58,997
Doesn't Daddy love oatmeal?
Yeah.

120
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:00,749
No, I love bacon.

121
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:04,294
<i>And from the insensitivity
of the new butler Jake.</i>

122
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:07,005
And this little piggy
stayed at home.

123
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:10,926
And this little piggy
had roast beef...

124
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:14,054
Jake! Oh, Jake. Stop it.
Oh, the poor baby.

125
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:18,892
<i>And occasionally she had to protect me,
even from myself.</i>

126
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:53,385
<i>So I did most of
my playing in my room...</i>

127
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:56,430
<i>Where I made my own friends.</i>

128
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:59,975
<i>And learnt to entertain myself.</i>

129
00:10:04,146 --> 00:10:07,691
<i>While my mother spent her every
waking hour preparing me.</i>

130
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,490
<i>Preparing me to be a suitable bride</i>

131
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:17,492
<i>for the man who
would break the curse.</i>

132
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:19,453
Quelle heure l'est-il?

133
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:23,874
<i>Then upon my eighteenth birthday
she hired Wanda</i>

134
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:25,584
<i>whose dating agency</i>

135
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:29,046
<i>catered to the best and the
brightest blue bloods.</i>

136
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:32,508
<i>In hopes of finding one.
One of my own kind</i>

137
00:10:32,925 --> 00:10:36,553
<i>Who would break the curse
by accepting me as I am.</i>

138
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:38,889
Hello.

139
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:50,150
<i>And upon their departure, they were
invited back to the house.</i>

140
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:54,196
<i>Where they were legally
gagged into secrecy.</i>

141
00:10:54,238 --> 00:10:55,864
<i>And so it went.</i>

142
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,330
<i>And it was just
a matter of time...</i>

143
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:07,334
<i>before my mother recognised the need
for certain adjustments.</i>

144
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:09,628
<i>Shatterproof glass...</i>

145
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,130
<i>And sneakers for Jake.</i>

146
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,467
<i>So you see today...</i>

147
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:17,344
She's a pig!

148
00:11:18,262 --> 00:11:21,515
<i>... was much like any other.
Except...</i>

149
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:24,184
- I couldn't catch him.
- Aah! I knew it.

150
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:26,103
<i>I always said we should
make them sign the gag</i>

151
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:27,896
<i>before they see her.
Not after.</i>

152
00:11:27,938 --> 00:11:29,648
<i>Don't worry.
We'll catch him.</i>

153
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,191
<i>We'd better.</i>

154
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:39,658
A snout?

155
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:44,246
And fangs.

156
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:50,627
Look, I know what I saw, alright?
Now, are you going to arrest her or not?

157
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:53,297
On what grounds?
Ugly blind date?

158
00:11:53,297 --> 00:11:56,341
If being ugly were a crime, I'd have to
arrest half the people in this city.

159
00:11:56,383 --> 00:12:00,304
I know what you're thinking.
The Wilherns, nice family right?

160
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:04,266
That's what I thought. And when
Penelope mentioned the curse

161
00:12:04,308 --> 00:12:08,187
I thought that was just a
figure of speech, yeah.

162
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:11,732
It's not a figure of speech.
And they're not nice.

163
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:16,153
I'm telling you if I hadn't of got out
of there when I did that...

164
00:12:16,195 --> 00:12:18,363
monster it would have
eaten me alive.

165
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:20,532
That's it.
Put him in holding over night.

166
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:21,241
Come on, mate.

167
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:23,660
What me?
No, you don't understand

168
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:25,954
I've come in to report her.

169
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:31,251
- Hey, wasn't that a Vanderman?
- Yeah, Edward.

170
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,130
That might be him...
no.

171
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:43,180
Okay, you know what? Edward should have
been home by now, don't you think?

172
00:12:43,347 --> 00:12:48,769
Hello, anybody? Will somebody
call my mother?

173
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:23,804
Rise and shine.

174
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:28,100
Up, up, up, up, up.

175
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:32,145
Come on, dear.
We're moving.

176
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:34,231
Franklin.

177
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:35,899
Mum?

178
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:38,402
- Up, up, up, up, up.
- What?

179
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:40,612
We're moving?

180
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:49,079
Where is Larry Bonsa?

181
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:53,250
Security.

182
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,752
Poor Edward.
I had no idea.

183
00:13:55,836 --> 00:13:57,421
No, not that.

184
00:13:57,504 --> 00:14:01,258
Hallucinations of a hideous pig
pig faced girl.

185
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:04,386
You do know who they're talking about?

186
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:09,391
Oh, I don't know. Could be any
number of women in this city.

187
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:12,603
I'm next in line for
chairman of the board.

188
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:16,273
Do you have any idea what a story
like this will do to me?

189
00:14:16,315 --> 00:14:19,109
What my father is going to do to me?

190
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,946
Well, that's not really my problem.

191
00:14:22,988 --> 00:14:30,120
Okay, I'm not a delusional maniac...
am I?

192
00:14:30,162 --> 00:14:33,707
No. So, either you
print a retraction

193
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:40,881
or so help me god I am going
to rip your guts out.

194
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:42,883
Security.

195
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:45,135
It'll be twenty five years
ago all over again.

196
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:49,306
Reporters popping out of draws.
Penelope will be exposed.

197
00:14:49,348 --> 00:14:52,059
And then... what chance do we have?

198
00:14:52,643 --> 00:14:55,395
- We could move to the beach.
- The beach is good.

199
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:58,065
- Or France?
- You could practise your French.

200
00:14:58,106 --> 00:15:00,150
I could practice my French.

201
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:04,738
Merci.

202
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:07,157
Bonjour. Je suis Penelope.

203
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:14,748
Never mind. I over reacted.
Wanda. Wanda!

204
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:20,504
I demand a retraction.
You have ruined my life!

205
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:23,090
I'm telling you she was
a pig. A pig!

206
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:27,261
I'm telling you she had a piggy snout
on her face and I'm not mad.

207
00:15:27,386 --> 00:15:29,763
Why will no one
believe me?

208
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:33,016
Wait, wait, hold, hold on there, Victor.

209
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:38,230
I believe that man is with me.

210
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:41,024
Huh? I am?

211
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:46,697
- Okay, well first there's Hubert Strauss.
- Good. Who else?

212
00:15:46,697 --> 00:15:48,115
- Beaux...
- Great.

213
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:49,575
- Jack...
- Fine.

214
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:51,285
...the Ripper?
- Super, who else?

215
00:15:51,285 --> 00:15:54,246
You know what? Why don't I just say,
'Here's twelve men. Trust me'.

216
00:15:54,288 --> 00:15:57,082
Terrific. Let's talk about the dowry.
I think we should double it.

217
00:15:57,124 --> 00:16:00,544
If they can't stand me now what makes
you think they'll be able to for double?

218
00:16:00,586 --> 00:16:04,381
- Oh, now, now with that attitude...
- Oh yeah, it's my attitude, mother.

219
00:16:06,175 --> 00:16:08,969
This guy's got a lot of potential.

220
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,181
I know he's going to look at her.

221
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:15,058
What do you think of this guy?
Do you like him?

222
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:18,562
Oh, sweetheart.

223
00:16:20,564 --> 00:16:24,276
I know, I know. It's not my face.

224
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:27,446
it's my great, great, great
grandfathers face

225
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:31,200
and he's not me, and I'm not him
and I'm not me.

226
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:32,993
And don't you forget it.

227
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:48,091
I gave my right eye
for that story.

228
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:52,346
And I got back squat.

229
00:16:52,471 --> 00:16:55,098
And that hideous woman
still gives me nightmares.

230
00:16:55,098 --> 00:16:56,642
I thought you never saw her?

231
00:16:56,683 --> 00:17:01,939
Hmm. No, not Penelope. Her mother.
I only caught a glimpse of the baby.

232
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,775
I thought my head
was playing tricks on me.

233
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:07,444
Well, thank God someone
believes me anyway.

234
00:17:07,486 --> 00:17:11,114
Unfortunately, my believing you isn't
going to do either one of us any good.

235
00:17:11,156 --> 00:17:14,993
We're going to need some proof
to clear both our names.

236
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:19,873
You think you can get back in there?

237
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:23,043
Oh, I don't... I don't know.

238
00:17:24,795 --> 00:17:26,463
I mean, if...

239
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:33,136
No.

240
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:37,391
- Are you sure? I just need one photo.
- I'm not going back in there.

241
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:39,476
Alright. Okay.

242
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:44,314
We're just going to have
find somebody who can.

243
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:46,066
Hook them up with the
agency that sent you.

244
00:17:46,108 --> 00:17:50,028
No, they only see old money, blue blood
types, it's part of the whole curse thing.

245
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:53,991
We're not going to find any blue bloods
to help us, they don't need the money.

246
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:57,244
No, but down and out
blue bloods do.

247
00:18:12,551 --> 00:18:14,136
Check.

248
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,014
Bet.

249
00:18:20,601 --> 00:18:22,769
Read 'em and weep,
losers.

250
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:24,104
Ah. crap!

251
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:32,779
You got a Maxwell Campion
playing here tonight?

252
00:18:32,821 --> 00:18:36,033
That's him there.
Poker table number five.

253
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:56,345
Hey, pal, wait up.

254
00:18:57,262 --> 00:18:58,430
Do I know you?

255
00:18:58,472 --> 00:19:01,767
No, but I know you.
Did a little research.

256
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:04,811
And it seems in a few short years
you've managed to gamble away

257
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:08,857
the fortune your family spent
generations building.

258
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:12,903
Hey, hear me out.
I'll make it worth your while.

259
00:19:12,945 --> 00:19:15,113
You got the wrong guy.

260
00:19:15,656 --> 00:19:18,450
Five thousand bucks worth your while?

261
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:24,456
We'll need your signature
on the last page.

262
00:19:24,498 --> 00:19:28,252
Just your standard gag.
You don't talk, we don't talk.

263
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:31,797
Just how ugly is this girl?

264
00:19:32,631 --> 00:19:34,716
I believe the young lady is waiting.

265
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:41,932
Wow, this guy is
wasting my time.

266
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:48,897
Oh, he's here.

267
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:52,943
- Hey, man, look, I'm sorry that I'm late.
- Alright, yeah. Take off the jacket.

268
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:56,405
Alright.

269
00:19:58,073 --> 00:19:58,782
Hey.

270
00:19:58,782 --> 00:20:00,784
Alright, now... hey you with me?

271
00:20:00,993 --> 00:20:04,872
Alright, the camera is in the lapel.
The rigging is in the sleeve. Put it on.

272
00:20:05,998 --> 00:20:07,249
Come on, it looks great on you.

273
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:10,794
Now to take a picture
you just raise either arm.

274
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:13,005
Not now.

275
00:20:13,005 --> 00:20:14,339
Alright. Look, I'm sorry, man.

276
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:17,384
Yeah, I know you are.
Did you have to gamble all night?

277
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:20,679
Yeah, I still had chips.
I'm good?

278
00:20:20,721 --> 00:20:22,681
Yeah. Let's... come on, let's go.

279
00:20:32,274 --> 00:20:34,234
Don't worry,
I'll get that.

280
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:35,944
And you are?

281
00:20:36,028 --> 00:20:38,614
I'm Max Campion
and the agency sent me.

282
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:42,701
- Oh, right. Campion.
- There you go... shit.

283
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:44,495
Excuse me?

284
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,915
God Damn!

285
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:21,907
Alright, dear, we've done as you asked.
They're all in the annexe.

286
00:21:21,949 --> 00:21:23,784
All of them?
All of them.

287
00:21:23,826 --> 00:21:27,412
But why you wouldn't rather talk to them
one at a time is beyond me.

288
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:30,958
I told you mother this way it will be easier
to weed out the unlikelys.

289
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:42,970
Hello, I'm Penelope.
And you must be?

290
00:21:46,098 --> 00:21:48,058
Late for tea?

291
00:21:50,561 --> 00:21:52,062
Jake!

292
00:21:53,605 --> 00:21:56,525
They're out, they're, they're running...
They've all seen her.

293
00:21:56,567 --> 00:21:58,819
Where's Max?

294
00:21:59,027 --> 00:22:00,779
Edward, do you see Max?

295
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:04,658
I don't see Max. He's not there.
There's no Max.

296
00:22:18,922 --> 00:22:21,008
- How could you?
- Just speeding things up.

297
00:22:21,008 --> 00:22:23,093
Oh, and now you're just going to
make a pig of yourself?

298
00:22:23,135 --> 00:22:25,721
- No, that's already been done for me.
- Stop it.

299
00:22:27,097 --> 00:22:29,600
That was the last of the ho-hos.

300
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,768
Where's your credit card?
I'm going to the store.

301
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:33,228
No, no, no don't you... hey!

302
00:22:33,353 --> 00:22:35,606
If you want more ho-ho's
I'll send Jake for some.

303
00:22:35,647 --> 00:22:37,733
I'm old enough
to get my own.

304
00:22:37,774 --> 00:22:39,776
Pick me up some cigarettes.

305
00:22:40,194 --> 00:22:42,696
Penelope,
just one man, one man.

306
00:22:42,696 --> 00:22:46,992
And he'll run too. They always run
why can't you accept that?

307
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:50,454
For seven years I've been
watching them run.

308
00:22:51,455 --> 00:22:55,334
Do you have any idea how that
makes me feel? Do you?

309
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:58,253
I'm sorry,
but we just can't quit.

310
00:22:58,295 --> 00:22:59,254
Yes we can because...

311
00:22:59,296 --> 00:23:02,257
no matter how much
I want to believe

312
00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:05,219
there's one man who
won't run away

313
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,720
one man who...

314
00:23:12,643 --> 00:23:16,188
Sweet loving angel of all
things merciful.

315
00:23:17,856 --> 00:23:19,399
Did he see?

316
00:23:19,441 --> 00:23:21,360
He must have.
He was there.

317
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:23,570
- Who is he?
- Who cares? Just go!

318
00:23:23,612 --> 00:23:24,821
- Yes, go.
- No, I can't...

319
00:23:24,863 --> 00:23:26,490
- Go!
- Go!

320
00:23:29,117 --> 00:23:30,786
Damn it.

321
00:23:37,751 --> 00:23:39,753
You're still here?

322
00:23:42,172 --> 00:23:44,424
Did you see?
See?

323
00:23:44,675 --> 00:23:47,052
You didn't see?
I didn't?

324
00:23:47,261 --> 00:23:49,972
Did you?
Did I what?

325
00:23:50,013 --> 00:23:53,433
Don't mess with me.
What? I'm messing with you?

326
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:55,602
Why are you still here?
Still?

327
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,939
Fine then,
why are you here?

328
00:23:58,981 --> 00:24:01,108
Look I'm sorry. Should I go?

329
00:24:07,281 --> 00:24:11,034
Are you a fan of George Rockham?

330
00:24:12,077 --> 00:24:13,453
Who?

331
00:24:14,997 --> 00:24:17,082
The book you've got in your jacket.

332
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:21,461
Oh, alright. You caught that, huh?

333
00:24:23,463 --> 00:24:27,384
Well... yeah.
Yeah, it's a great book.

334
00:24:28,635 --> 00:24:30,554
So you've read it?

335
00:24:31,388 --> 00:24:32,514
Well, yeah.

336
00:24:32,556 --> 00:24:35,184
Funny I thought that was the only
surviving copy.

337
00:24:35,225 --> 00:24:41,273
You know what? I meant to read it, but
the library was always out

338
00:24:46,153 --> 00:24:50,157
I saw it was a first edition
and I figured it might be worth something.

339
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,117
So you were stealing it?

340
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:56,163
Well... Yeah. I was stealing it.

341
00:24:57,748 --> 00:25:00,167
So, you're a fan of the money?

342
00:25:01,168 --> 00:25:05,881
I'm a big fan of the money.
Although, it doesn't much care for me.

343
00:25:05,923 --> 00:25:09,009
Well, maybe you and the money
weren't meant to be.

344
00:25:09,051 --> 00:25:12,137
Hey, I wouldn't go that far.
Jinx me.

345
00:25:14,348 --> 00:25:17,768
There are 326 first editions
in that room.

346
00:25:17,976 --> 00:25:21,605
Of those, 300 are worth
over 50,000.

347
00:25:22,147 --> 00:25:25,484
A dozen or so are worth
over 25,000.

348
00:25:26,026 --> 00:25:29,238
And I'm afraid there's only one
that's valued under a hundred.

349
00:25:29,363 --> 00:25:30,364
Only one, huh?

350
00:25:30,364 --> 00:25:34,785
A little novel, written by a little
nobody, that never amounted to anything.

351
00:25:35,786 --> 00:25:38,539
You don't say. Under a hundred?

352
00:25:39,248 --> 00:25:43,544
I'm afraid so. And...
I'm afraid that it's time for...

353
00:25:43,544 --> 00:25:46,463
- But it's your favourite just the same?
- What?

354
00:25:47,047 --> 00:25:49,132
I said,
'your favourite just the same'.

355
00:25:49,174 --> 00:25:50,509
I heard you.

356
00:25:55,806 --> 00:25:58,809
Top shelf,
third from the left,

357
00:25:58,851 --> 00:26:01,770
'Moby Dick'.
It's a first edition.

358
00:26:03,021 --> 00:26:05,941
But wait till I'm gone
or they'll see you.

359
00:26:06,358 --> 00:26:07,818
See me?

360
00:26:09,486 --> 00:26:10,737
What?

361
00:26:16,076 --> 00:26:17,411
Hello?

362
00:26:19,496 --> 00:26:21,165
<i>Hello?</i>

363
00:26:48,692 --> 00:26:50,027
Got ya!

364
00:26:53,488 --> 00:26:54,948
No?

365
00:27:00,287 --> 00:27:01,705
Penelope?

366
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,715
Penelope?

367
00:27:34,988 --> 00:27:36,865
Will you be back tomorrow?

368
00:27:37,074 --> 00:27:40,327
I knew it.
I knew you were there.

369
00:27:41,245 --> 00:27:42,496
Yeah.

370
00:27:51,755 --> 00:27:54,258
- He'll be back.
- He will.

371
00:27:58,846 --> 00:28:01,890
- So?
- I didn't get it.

372
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:04,184
How could you not get it,
half the men in this city...

373
00:28:04,226 --> 00:28:06,770
Relax.
I'm coming back tomorrow.

374
00:28:09,815 --> 00:28:10,858
Ow! Door.

375
00:28:11,483 --> 00:28:12,943
You better.

376
00:28:13,694 --> 00:28:15,112
See you tomorrow.

377
00:28:16,905 --> 00:28:18,448
Better.

378
00:28:30,878 --> 00:28:33,297
Sweetheart? What's wrong?

379
00:28:35,132 --> 00:28:38,468
I thought he just knew,
but it says it right here.

380
00:28:40,971 --> 00:28:42,556
Still he chose it.

381
00:28:42,598 --> 00:28:44,850
Of the 2,000 that aren't
your favourite,

382
00:28:44,892 --> 00:28:47,060
he chose the one that is.

383
00:29:35,526 --> 00:29:36,777
Alright. Alright.

384
00:29:57,005 --> 00:29:58,257
<i>Do you play?</i>

385
00:30:01,385 --> 00:30:03,679
I wish you'd stop
doing that.

386
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,305
- Do you play?
- The frog?

387
00:30:05,347 --> 00:30:08,809
No, no although I always meant
to pick it up.

388
00:30:08,976 --> 00:30:10,978
But you do play something.

389
00:30:13,272 --> 00:30:16,191
- What makes you say that?
- What do you play?

390
00:30:21,321 --> 00:30:22,739
Guess.

391
00:30:25,492 --> 00:30:27,119
Is this really necessary?

392
00:30:27,161 --> 00:30:29,413
She's finding
his instrument.

393
00:30:29,413 --> 00:30:32,040
Isn't that something a man
should do for himself?

394
00:30:32,166 --> 00:30:33,917
<i>And a one, and a two, and a one.</i>

395
00:30:34,126 --> 00:30:37,880
<i>You are my sunshine,
my only sunshine</i>

396
00:30:38,088 --> 00:30:42,342
<i>You make me happy
when skies are grey.</i>

397
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:46,221
<i>You'll never know, dear
dear how much I love you.</i>

398
00:30:46,263 --> 00:30:47,556
Are you even playing that?

399
00:30:47,598 --> 00:30:51,101
<i>So please don't take
my sunshine away.</i>

400
00:30:51,143 --> 00:30:53,312
- Okay, it's not the bass.
- No? No?

401
00:30:53,729 --> 00:30:55,564
- Try the drums.
- Alright.

402
00:30:55,606 --> 00:30:57,357
The drums, you play drums.

403
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:00,611
Okay.

404
00:31:04,281 --> 00:31:09,369
<i>So please don't take...
my sunshine away.</i>

405
00:31:09,578 --> 00:31:12,372
Okay, okay, no, no, no.
No more drums.

406
00:31:12,915 --> 00:31:16,251
No?
Not the drums, it's not the drums...

407
00:31:17,503 --> 00:31:18,462
<i>Alright!</i>

408
00:31:18,462 --> 00:31:20,130
Saxophone, saxophone!

409
00:31:20,547 --> 00:31:21,965
You want sax?

410
00:31:26,887 --> 00:31:30,224
One... two... one, two.

411
00:31:35,646 --> 00:31:39,149
Enough, stop. Stop, stop!

412
00:31:39,191 --> 00:31:42,653
- Enough.
- No? No, alright.

413
00:31:42,736 --> 00:31:44,905
Play the guitar.
The guitar.

414
00:31:45,155 --> 00:31:47,741
Guitar.
It's got to be the guitar.

415
00:31:54,414 --> 00:31:57,334
I don't think that's how
you play the guitar.

416
00:32:13,392 --> 00:32:19,231
Okay, stop, stop. stop!
Please stop, stop.

417
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:25,195
Oh, my.
That was, that was terrible.

418
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:26,071
Hey everybody, everybody wave.

419
00:32:26,113 --> 00:32:28,949
Everybody wave to Penelope
and take a bow, alright? And bow.

420
00:32:30,784 --> 00:32:34,121
I know, I know you guys
you were fantastic

421
00:32:34,246 --> 00:32:35,789
though come here.
Thank you so much for everything.

422
00:32:35,831 --> 00:32:37,374
Wait, wait
I'm not done guessing.

423
00:32:37,457 --> 00:32:41,628
Come on, enough about me.
What do you play?

424
00:32:45,215 --> 00:32:48,135
You want to be a hortomacultural what?

425
00:32:48,218 --> 00:32:51,471
A horticulturalist.
You know? Someone who works with plants.

426
00:32:51,638 --> 00:32:52,723
Right.

427
00:32:53,724 --> 00:32:54,850
Why is that funny?

428
00:32:54,892 --> 00:32:59,980
No plants are great. I just thought
of you as like... like a cop.

429
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:03,150
You know seeing as you've got
the whole interrogation thing down.

430
00:33:03,233 --> 00:33:05,319
Shut up, it's your move.

431
00:33:06,487 --> 00:33:08,030
Alright.

432
00:33:09,281 --> 00:33:12,242
- Oh, you really don't want to do that.
- Why not?

433
00:33:12,284 --> 00:33:15,579
- Because I'll kill her.
- What if I asked you not to?

434
00:33:15,621 --> 00:33:18,874
I'd still kill her.
You'd sort of be begging me to.

435
00:33:19,708 --> 00:33:22,753
So, beer.
You've never had a beer?

436
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,171
I've had a beer.

437
00:33:24,171 --> 00:33:26,256
- On tap?
- No, not on tap.

438
00:33:26,298 --> 00:33:28,342
Well, then you've never had a beer.

439
00:33:28,342 --> 00:33:30,969
- Your knight can't do that.
- My knight?

440
00:33:31,094 --> 00:33:33,180
- The horse.
- Alright.

441
00:33:35,974 --> 00:33:39,311
Hey, how about you and me heading down
to the Cloverdilly pub right now?

442
00:33:39,603 --> 00:33:41,522
Pub Cloverdilly?

443
00:33:41,688 --> 00:33:45,984
Best beer, best blues, some
of the best beer bums in town.

444
00:33:46,026 --> 00:33:48,070
Thanks, maybe later.

445
00:33:51,281 --> 00:33:53,075
Penelope, come on.

446
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,542
Come on, you've got to
get out of there sometime.

447
00:34:02,251 --> 00:34:03,377
Right?

448
00:34:05,379 --> 00:34:07,464
What are you waiting for?

449
00:34:26,233 --> 00:34:30,195
You know, truth is, you're...
you're not missing much.

450
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:36,743
Really?
The Cloverdilly pub sounds fun.

451
00:34:36,994 --> 00:34:39,079
Yeah, but... aside from that.

452
00:34:39,913 --> 00:34:44,168
And the street fairs? I hear they sell
really cool stuff right on the street.

453
00:34:44,501 --> 00:34:47,504
You know, the vendors themselves
are pretty cool too.

454
00:34:47,546 --> 00:34:50,007
- Oh, and the park?
- The park is great.

455
00:34:51,675 --> 00:34:53,302
I used to spend
every weekend there

456
00:34:53,343 --> 00:34:56,722
just hanging on a bench
writing stupid love songs...

457
00:34:56,763 --> 00:35:00,100
- People watching.
- Used to? You don't do that anymore?

458
00:35:04,813 --> 00:35:06,690
What are you doing instead?

459
00:35:11,487 --> 00:35:15,449
- Well, beating you at chess.
- I warned you I'd kill her.

460
00:35:15,491 --> 00:35:18,452
That's great because as soon as my guys
here have seen what you've done...

461
00:35:18,494 --> 00:35:20,120
The game will be over,
your queen will be dead.

462
00:35:20,162 --> 00:35:22,456
My king's still pretty active, you know?

463
00:35:22,539 --> 00:35:25,375
Once the queers dead
the kings useless.

464
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:29,213
- What's that about?
- I don't know?

465
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:33,717
Maybe he's too depressed to fight.
He really loved her you know?

466
00:35:37,888 --> 00:35:39,431
Yeah, I can see that.

467
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:44,436
My queen to yours,
checkmate.

468
00:35:44,728 --> 00:35:46,313
You got me.

469
00:36:07,084 --> 00:36:09,670
Man,
what is this guy doing?

470
00:36:10,003 --> 00:36:12,172
Wasting all my film.

471
00:36:12,381 --> 00:36:15,926
He's doing it on purpose.
He's going for the dowry.

472
00:36:15,968 --> 00:36:19,054
I wish I could find a girl
with a dowry.

473
00:36:19,596 --> 00:36:20,889
Give me a break.

474
00:36:20,931 --> 00:36:24,768
Why else would it be taking you so long?
She revealed herself to me straight away.

475
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:27,604
You know what?
I guess she liked you more.

476
00:36:28,355 --> 00:36:31,775
Why settle for five thousand when
you could get ten times that, right?

477
00:36:31,817 --> 00:36:35,946
Well, maybe you're forgetting -
I've seen her. She is grotesque.

478
00:36:35,988 --> 00:36:36,864
Shut him up.

479
00:36:36,864 --> 00:36:40,450
I'm talking un-kissable
ugly. Nightmare ugly.

480
00:36:41,285 --> 00:36:47,207
Listen you little worm. I know your
kind spoiled rotten mama's boy...

481
00:36:47,249 --> 00:36:49,293
God! He licked me.

482
00:36:49,334 --> 00:36:50,669
- Edward.
- What?

483
00:36:50,669 --> 00:36:52,212
Don't lick Max.

484
00:36:52,629 --> 00:36:53,672
Sorry.

485
00:36:54,214 --> 00:36:56,175
Listen you can't blame us
for being a little suspicious.

486
00:36:56,216 --> 00:36:59,928
- Fine, find someone else.
- Fine, give us back the money.

487
00:37:15,986 --> 00:37:18,989
It's starting. It's starting!
Would you come on!

488
00:37:20,657 --> 00:37:22,659
<i>Okay, I've got it. Piano.</i>

489
00:37:23,577 --> 00:37:27,039
You play the piano.
I bet my life on it.

490
00:37:27,331 --> 00:37:31,210
Alright, keep in mind;
'never bet a better'.

491
00:37:34,838 --> 00:37:37,049
Does he have another jacket?

492
00:37:42,179 --> 00:37:44,640
And a one, and a two and a one...

493
00:37:44,765 --> 00:37:48,810
<i>You are my sunshine...</i>

494
00:37:50,103 --> 00:37:53,607
<i>My only sunshine...</i>

495
00:37:54,358 --> 00:37:59,988
<i>You make me happy
No, it's B flat.</i>

496
00:38:04,993 --> 00:38:07,204
B flat on the right hand.

497
00:38:10,541 --> 00:38:12,709
No, right hand!

498
00:38:24,888 --> 00:38:29,059
You see, the left hand stays, and
the right hand plays the chord.

499
00:38:34,189 --> 00:38:36,567
- You see?
- Yeah, yeah. It's better.

500
00:39:19,943 --> 00:39:22,362
- Shit!
- I'm a monster.

501
00:39:22,571 --> 00:39:24,448
No, no your not,
Penelope!

502
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:37,794
Stay with Max.

503
00:39:39,796 --> 00:39:41,673
Darling, do not...
Please, do not...

504
00:39:41,673 --> 00:39:43,842
I told you! I told you!

505
00:39:43,884 --> 00:39:45,928
No, you ran.
It was you this time.

506
00:39:45,969 --> 00:39:47,679
- He said 'shit'
- Big shit.

507
00:39:47,721 --> 00:39:49,389
He said 'shit'
to me twice.

508
00:39:49,389 --> 00:39:51,642
And then he just stood there
staring at me.

509
00:39:51,683 --> 00:39:53,393
No one's ever just stood
there before.

510
00:39:53,435 --> 00:39:57,064
If you give the poor boy a chance to
adjust. I mean, put yourself in...

511
00:39:57,105 --> 00:40:01,652
What are you doing?
I told you to stay with him.

512
00:40:01,902 --> 00:40:04,154
You did?
I didn't hear you.

513
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:10,327
When you said,
'stay with Max'...

514
00:40:10,369 --> 00:40:11,745
I meant
stay with Max.

515
00:40:11,787 --> 00:40:13,997
You never said,
'Wanda, stay with him'.

516
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:19,503
<i>- I told you!
- I'm sorry I didn't hear you.</i>

517
00:40:23,382 --> 00:40:24,383
Mom?

518
00:40:24,424 --> 00:40:27,219
Don't worry, dear.
He couldn't have gone far

519
00:40:29,721 --> 00:40:32,099
- Did you get it?
- Yeah. Yeah, I got it.

520
00:40:35,352 --> 00:40:37,187
Hey, I needed that photo.

521
00:40:37,229 --> 00:40:40,566
She's not what Edward said she was.
You just leave her alone.

522
00:40:42,442 --> 00:40:43,777
Lemon?

523
00:40:47,114 --> 00:40:49,074
- Who is that?
- Lock the gate!

524
00:40:49,116 --> 00:40:50,993
No, don't, don't shut the gate!

525
00:40:55,164 --> 00:40:58,375
I got him, I got him.

526
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:02,546
Penelope, there's something
I have to tell you.

527
00:41:02,754 --> 00:41:04,631
- No, he's a spy.
- No... yes.

528
00:41:04,631 --> 00:41:06,592
Yes, he's a spy.
He's working for Lemon,

529
00:41:06,633 --> 00:41:08,886
The reporter who forced me
to bury you.

530
00:41:08,886 --> 00:41:10,971
- You said I was cremated.
- That too.

531
00:41:11,013 --> 00:41:13,807
I hope you were well paid, because
you just said goodbye to a fortune.

532
00:41:13,932 --> 00:41:16,977
Wait!
He's still one of your own kind.

533
00:41:16,977 --> 00:41:18,687
He could still break the curse.

534
00:41:18,729 --> 00:41:23,400
Max. I know this face
repulses you...

535
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:27,070
And I... and I wouldn't dream of
asking you to accept it.

536
00:41:27,279 --> 00:41:28,947
But this isn't me.

537
00:41:28,989 --> 00:41:32,910
The real me is inside here
somewhere just waiting to get out.

538
00:41:33,118 --> 00:41:35,162
And you can
make that happen.

539
00:41:35,204 --> 00:41:38,540
Once the curse is broken
I'll be just like anybody else.

540
00:41:38,582 --> 00:41:42,711
What if you're not?
What if the curse isn't broken.

541
00:41:43,003 --> 00:41:46,423
What if... what if the curse can
never be broken?

542
00:41:46,465 --> 00:41:49,801
Then I'll kill myself. I promise.
I promise I will.

543
00:41:50,511 --> 00:41:52,012
Marry me, Max.

544
00:41:56,058 --> 00:41:57,601
Marry me.

545
00:42:06,902 --> 00:42:08,153
I can't.

546
00:42:12,616 --> 00:42:13,659
Get out!

547
00:42:14,952 --> 00:42:16,078
- I'm...
- Get out!

548
00:42:16,787 --> 00:42:18,372
- Get out!
- Out!

549
00:42:18,997 --> 00:42:21,083
Right out!

550
00:42:45,482 --> 00:42:47,985
Okay,
this is what we're going to do...

551
00:42:48,026 --> 00:42:51,196
<i>I felt the rush
of a thousand heart breaks.</i>

552
00:42:51,655 --> 00:42:54,741
This is nothing we haven't been
through before.

553
00:42:55,075 --> 00:42:57,995
<i>Penelope,
we can do it again.</i>

554
00:43:00,289 --> 00:43:02,583
<i>I will never give up, sweetheart.</i>

555
00:43:04,168 --> 00:43:06,044
Never, Penelope!

556
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:14,595
<i>And I knew with all my heart
she meant it.</i>

557
00:44:25,666 --> 00:44:28,919
<i>We have both always
known there was no guarantee.</i>

558
00:44:28,961 --> 00:44:32,256
We have not both always known
that there was no guarantee.

559
00:44:32,297 --> 00:44:34,216
We have spent
so much time preparing her

560
00:44:34,258 --> 00:44:35,968
for the day things
would be different,

561
00:44:36,009 --> 00:44:39,012
we've never prepared her
for the day that they're not.

562
00:44:39,429 --> 00:44:43,308
Maybe we should stop all
this match making and...

563
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:45,811
give her a puppy. Hmm?

564
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:50,816
Sweetheart?
Penelope is that you?

565
00:44:50,858 --> 00:44:53,443
<i>Yes, mother. I'm just going
to make some cocoa.</i>

566
00:44:58,031 --> 00:44:59,575
A puppy.

567
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:06,373
- Okay.
- What can I say?

568
00:45:06,456 --> 00:45:10,919
I'm sorry you got stuck with me.
I'm sorry I dragged you down with me.

569
00:45:10,961 --> 00:45:15,424
I know I'm the bad blood.
I am the Wilhern. I know that.

570
00:45:15,465 --> 00:45:17,926
The curse is on me.
I am the curse.

571
00:45:17,968 --> 00:45:20,304
Me,. It's me, it's me I, me, me, me.

572
00:45:20,304 --> 00:45:24,308
Honey. Honey! I think your father
could use some cocoa too.

573
00:45:25,767 --> 00:45:27,227
<i>Okay mother.</i>

574
00:45:33,484 --> 00:45:36,570
Actually I might have
a cup too.

575
00:45:38,906 --> 00:45:40,240
Penelope?

576
00:46:28,413 --> 00:46:29,957
She's escaped.

577
00:46:31,333 --> 00:46:34,002
- Let's go.
- God, she's going to be coming after me.

578
00:46:34,044 --> 00:46:36,630
- Edward, you've got to control yourself.
- Quick!

579
00:47:08,328 --> 00:47:09,872
- What are you doing?
- We need help.

580
00:47:09,913 --> 00:47:12,207
Yes, I'd like to report
my daughter missing.

581
00:47:12,332 --> 00:47:14,293
Are you out of your mind?
What if they find her?

582
00:47:14,334 --> 00:47:16,170
For crying out loud Jessica!

583
00:48:45,092 --> 00:48:47,928
Okay, you know what? I can't hold it
any longer. Come with me.

584
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:50,764
I have to pee and I can't leave
you alone with the phones.

585
00:48:50,764 --> 00:48:52,474
You know dear,
there was a time...

586
00:48:52,516 --> 00:48:56,478
when I might have jumped at such
an invitation, but right now I can't.

587
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:04,278
- Hello
- Mum?

588
00:49:04,278 --> 00:49:07,072
<i>Hold the line, please.
- Mum?</i>

589
00:49:07,114 --> 00:49:09,700
<i>Collect call from Penelope...
- Yes, we'll accept</i>

590
00:49:09,741 --> 00:49:11,702
<i>- Mum?
Go ahead with your call, please.</i>

591
00:49:11,743 --> 00:49:12,744
Hello...

592
00:49:12,786 --> 00:49:15,205
<i>Penelope, what the hell
were you thinking?</i>

593
00:49:15,247 --> 00:49:17,499
<i>- Did anyone see you yet?
No... Mum, no</i>

594
00:49:17,541 --> 00:49:19,918
Good, good. Where are you?
We'll come and get you.

595
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:24,715
<i>I'm just calling to say that
I love you, and... goodbye.</i>

596
00:49:25,465 --> 00:49:27,134
<i>Penelope don't...</i>

597
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:36,310
At least we know
she's alright.

598
00:49:38,187 --> 00:49:41,940
- Don't you have to pee or something?
- No, dear, that was you.

599
00:50:16,683 --> 00:50:18,936
I can check you in over here.

600
00:50:23,106 --> 00:50:24,191
Hi...

601
00:50:24,191 --> 00:50:26,777
can I have a room, please?

602
00:50:26,985 --> 00:50:30,322
Shouldn't be a problem.
Room 8 is available.

603
00:50:30,364 --> 00:50:33,367
- Thank you.
- You don't want the room?

604
00:50:35,118 --> 00:50:36,870
No, I, I want the room.

605
00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:40,207
Then would you mind coming
back here so I can check you in?

606
00:50:43,252 --> 00:50:46,380
Thank you.
And how will you be paying for your room?

607
00:50:50,968 --> 00:50:52,636
Thank you, Jessica

608
00:51:37,264 --> 00:51:40,684
Okay, that's it for me, folks.
New dealer coming in.

609
00:51:54,573 --> 00:51:59,870
Erm, nostrils are bigger.
More... more piggy.

610
00:52:00,537 --> 00:52:03,540
Hey, hey. Guys, guys, come on.
We've got to wrap this up.

611
00:52:03,582 --> 00:52:06,251
I've got a deadline here.
We've got to go to print.

612
00:52:06,376 --> 00:52:09,379
- Crosser, crosser...
- Freakir Mona Lisa come on...

613
00:52:14,718 --> 00:52:17,638
- Your morning paper, madam.
- Oh, thanks, Jake.

614
00:52:18,889 --> 00:52:20,641
Holy magda! Aaaah!

615
00:52:25,229 --> 00:52:28,232
- Damn it, Edward!
- Dad, they all think I'm crazy.

616
00:52:28,273 --> 00:52:30,567
And this helps you?
How?

617
00:52:31,485 --> 00:52:35,239
You told me...
I thought this would prove...

618
00:52:36,824 --> 00:52:38,784
Try to remember I'm your son.

619
00:52:38,826 --> 00:52:41,995
That's exactly what
I'm trying to forget.

620
00:53:09,439 --> 00:53:11,733
Thank you, ma'am.
Gentlemen.

621
00:53:18,532 --> 00:53:21,326
So, how's everybody doing this fine day?

622
00:53:21,869 --> 00:53:23,162
I thought you
went home.

623
00:53:23,203 --> 00:53:27,040
I did. Slept for eight blissful hours,
fixed the kids breakfast,

624
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:32,379
kissed the wife goodbye, and, according
to the button, it's your blind.

625
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:38,635
You want to take your blind?

626
00:53:40,637 --> 00:53:42,472
Are you in or out?

627
00:53:42,472 --> 00:53:44,808
Hey, he's still
got chips. He's in.

628
00:54:02,075 --> 00:54:05,662
Just give him some time.
He's in. He'll come around.

629
00:54:11,502 --> 00:54:14,171
Yeah, I'll take another.
Make it a large one.

630
00:54:14,213 --> 00:54:16,673
Hey, he's still got chips.
He's in

631
00:54:48,622 --> 00:54:51,124
For starters, I'm going to need
a recent photograph.

632
00:54:51,124 --> 00:54:53,377
- No photographs.
- None whatsoever?

633
00:54:53,418 --> 00:54:56,004
No. The er... fire got them.

634
00:54:57,381 --> 00:54:59,883
OK,
a detailed description.

635
00:55:01,718 --> 00:55:04,763
Brown hair.

636
00:55:06,557 --> 00:55:09,059
Brown eyes.

637
00:55:11,019 --> 00:55:14,064
A unique... ly pleasant
personality.

638
00:55:14,064 --> 00:55:15,732
Think pig.

639
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:18,569
- So she's a fat girl?
- Not exactly.

640
00:55:18,610 --> 00:55:20,904
Jessica!
Not in front of company.

641
00:55:20,904 --> 00:55:22,990
Don't be silly.
He knows I didn't mean it.

642
00:55:23,031 --> 00:55:24,575
That's not true, madam.

643
00:55:24,616 --> 00:55:27,828
I may not have said anything,
but I was filing it away.

644
00:55:27,911 --> 00:55:29,872
So she's not exactly fat?

645
00:55:29,913 --> 00:55:33,542
Does any of this really matter?
Just go find her!

646
00:55:33,584 --> 00:55:37,171
Our daughter's out there somewhere,
lost and afraid

647
00:55:52,102 --> 00:55:54,271
You haven't given me anything to go on.

648
00:55:54,313 --> 00:55:57,483
No photographs, no friends,
no job, no hangouts...

649
00:55:57,524 --> 00:56:00,486
It's something like this,
but minus the fangs.

650
00:56:00,527 --> 00:56:03,447
- Franklin!
- Do you want to find her or not?

651
00:56:03,989 --> 00:56:05,782
Minus the fangs.

652
00:56:06,783 --> 00:56:09,119
They're certainly eye-grabbing.

653
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:11,371
Jake, purse.

654
00:56:14,416 --> 00:56:17,961
OK, you know what? Never mind.
How much do we owe you?

655
00:56:18,378 --> 00:56:20,130
Where's my...?

656
00:56:20,672 --> 00:56:22,883
Who took my wallet?!

657
00:56:47,991 --> 00:56:52,246
It's our daughter. Please help us.
Please, I'm begging you.

658
00:56:52,579 --> 00:56:55,833
What he's trying to say is,
give us the key now!

659
00:56:55,833 --> 00:56:57,084
I'm sorry, but...

660
00:56:57,084 --> 00:56:59,419
The room is registered
in my name with my...

661
00:56:59,461 --> 00:57:01,755
Who's the guest? Me.
That makes me the guest.

662
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:10,931
You two go on ahead.
Not real big on the fang thing.

663
00:57:18,355 --> 00:57:21,775
Well, at least we know
she's not starving.

664
00:57:49,303 --> 00:57:52,639
No, not... not just... not just any pig.

665
00:57:53,473 --> 00:57:56,602
You need to stop talking now.

666
00:57:58,896 --> 00:58:00,230
Hello?

667
00:58:01,315 --> 00:58:02,858
Yeah, that's right...

668
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:08,489
- Penelope?
- Who is this?

669
00:58:11,492 --> 00:58:13,494
That was Penelope on the...

670
00:58:16,413 --> 00:58:18,499
Sell her own picture?

671
00:58:19,958 --> 00:58:23,921
Er... then why did you hang up?

672
00:58:24,546 --> 00:58:27,466
Edward, what's... what's wrong with you?
Did you ever...?

673
00:58:38,185 --> 00:58:39,561
How did you know it was me?

674
00:58:39,603 --> 00:58:42,689
<i>Just a lucky guess. You have
something you want to sell us?</i>

675
00:58:42,731 --> 00:58:44,024
That's right.

676
00:58:44,149 --> 00:58:45,901
May I ask
why you are doing this?

677
00:58:45,943 --> 00:58:48,612
<i>What do you care?
You're getting a freak.</i>

678
00:58:48,654 --> 00:58:51,198
Hey, nobody said anything
about a freak.

679
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:54,159
<i>- Listen, do you want it or not?
- Sure. Yes.</i>

680
00:58:54,785 --> 00:58:57,287
Yes. Yes, I do. Thank you.

681
00:59:31,697 --> 00:59:34,825
- Look, Grandma, a pig!
- How nice.

682
01:00:33,550 --> 01:00:34,801
Fangs?

683
01:00:36,970 --> 01:00:38,972
There are no fangs.

684
01:00:43,310 --> 01:00:47,481
Well, she must just suck them back
Edward, you know, I've been thinking.

685
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:52,569
I know and you know.
Maybe that's enough.

686
01:00:52,611 --> 01:00:56,907
Lemon, half the people in this
city think I'm crazy.

687
01:00:58,033 --> 01:01:01,078
I've got to prove to them
that I'm not.

688
01:01:01,245 --> 01:01:04,081
I'm sorry.
I've got to do it.

689
01:01:06,250 --> 01:01:08,252
Ladies and gentlemen,

690
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:12,005
I give you
the pig-faced girl.

691
01:01:12,047 --> 01:01:14,091
You see? I'm not crazy.

692
01:01:14,174 --> 01:01:17,845
Am I crazy? You, am I crazy?
I'm not crazy.

693
01:01:32,109 --> 01:01:34,194
You weren't kidding!

694
01:01:46,206 --> 01:01:47,875
Can I get you something?

695
01:01:48,083 --> 01:01:50,460
Can I have a beer on tap,
please?

696
01:01:50,502 --> 01:01:52,462
Sure. You can have this one.

697
01:01:53,922 --> 01:01:55,465
Coming right up.

698
01:01:58,635 --> 01:02:01,430
- You're supposed to catch it.
- Oh, sorry.

699
01:02:04,892 --> 01:02:06,727
Are you ready now?

700
01:02:08,228 --> 01:02:10,314
- There you go.
- Thank you.

701
01:02:15,194 --> 01:02:16,653
Is there a problem?

702
01:02:18,405 --> 01:02:20,199
- Do you have any straws?
- Sure.

703
01:02:24,077 --> 01:02:25,329
There you go.

704
01:02:39,676 --> 01:02:40,844
That's half of what you gave me.

705
01:02:40,886 --> 01:02:43,347
You'll get the rest back
when I'm ready.

706
01:02:43,388 --> 01:02:45,849
- Let's just call it even.
- No, let's not.

707
01:02:46,058 --> 01:02:47,768
She's not some
freaking pay day.

708
01:02:47,810 --> 01:02:49,520
She sold me the photo herself.

709
01:02:50,437 --> 01:02:53,857
Yeah. Apparently, she's...
out there on her own,

710
01:02:54,691 --> 01:02:56,902
declaring her independence.

711
01:03:22,970 --> 01:03:24,638
- Hey there, Jack.
- Annie!

712
01:03:24,721 --> 01:03:27,224
Lucky you, last
delivery of the day.

713
01:03:27,474 --> 01:03:28,559
How are you doing?

714
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:29,309
Are you sure you really want to know,
or are you just asking?

715
01:03:30,978 --> 01:03:33,355
- I'm just asking.
- So I'm driving my Vespa,

716
01:03:33,397 --> 01:03:36,275
and this guy comes out of nowhere
and hits me. I go flying.

717
01:03:36,316 --> 01:03:39,153
I'm in the street and he's stands over
me and he's, like,

718
01:03:39,153 --> 01:03:40,779
'I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't see.

719
01:03:40,821 --> 01:03:44,158
How can he not see me, you know?
I'm on a Vespa with wings.

720
01:03:44,158 --> 01:03:47,244
I mean, right, you can see me.
You can see me, right?

721
01:03:47,786 --> 01:03:49,163
What?

722
01:03:49,246 --> 01:03:51,540
See? She can see me.

723
01:03:52,666 --> 01:03:55,043
You ought to sic Billy on him.

724
01:03:55,085 --> 01:03:57,796
Yeah, it's a little too late.
You've got to sign here.

725
01:03:57,838 --> 01:04:02,509
- Billy moved back to the burbs.
- Yeah? Sorry to hear it.

726
01:04:02,509 --> 01:04:05,179
Yeah. We had no business being together.
He was a picket fence kind of guy.

727
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:07,681
And, like, what guy looks at me
and thinks picket fence.

728
01:04:07,681 --> 01:04:11,977
Unless he's crazy, and I'm done
dating crazy, you know? Done.

729
01:04:12,186 --> 01:04:13,937
Unless it's meant to be.
Right?

730
01:04:13,979 --> 01:04:14,897
Yeah. Right.

731
01:04:15,022 --> 01:04:16,773
- Right?
- Right.

732
01:04:16,982 --> 01:04:20,027
I can't hear you with that
thing on your face.

733
01:04:22,196 --> 01:04:24,573
The usual.
On the house.

734
01:04:24,615 --> 01:04:26,992
Thanks, Jack.
You're the best.

735
01:04:27,034 --> 01:04:28,243
Cheers.

736
01:04:36,585 --> 01:04:40,130
So, what? Are you hiding from the law,
or is that a bad nose job?

737
01:04:40,172 --> 01:04:42,216
Mm-hm. Bad nose job.

738
01:04:45,052 --> 01:04:49,389
Do you mind me asking how much that
might cost somebody, like a nose job?

739
01:04:49,515 --> 01:04:51,600
- Oh, nothing.
- Free?

740
01:04:54,394 --> 01:04:58,065
I was just thinking maybe... getting a
little work done myself.

741
01:04:58,106 --> 01:04:59,817
A nose job?

742
01:04:59,817 --> 01:05:02,861
Yeah, kind of, but for like
for my ears, you know?

743
01:05:02,986 --> 01:05:06,740
They just, stick out up here a little on
the top. I mean, I'm no Penelope, but...

744
01:05:06,740 --> 01:05:10,244
No, you have beautiful ears.
Beautiful. They're beautiful.

745
01:05:10,285 --> 01:05:12,454
- What, are you drunk?
- I'm drunk.

746
01:05:14,540 --> 01:05:17,251
Hey, Jack, how about another round
for my pal, Scarfy, here?

747
01:05:17,292 --> 01:05:18,418
Coming up.

748
01:05:20,587 --> 01:05:22,673
What's a Vespa?

749
01:05:22,756 --> 01:05:25,676
What's a V...? You've never
ridden on a Vespa?

750
01:05:28,428 --> 01:05:31,932
- Hey, Sam, long time no see.
- Wow, look who's back.

751
01:05:33,433 --> 01:05:36,228
Look... have you seen the guys around?

752
01:05:36,270 --> 01:05:39,690
They're touring, opening for some
band who's supposed to be good.

753
01:05:39,731 --> 01:05:43,110
- No kidding? That's... that's great.
- What brings you back here?

754
01:05:43,152 --> 01:05:45,821
Oh, you know...
looking around.

755
01:05:46,113 --> 01:05:49,449
Actually, I thought it was maybe time
I started playing again.

756
01:05:49,491 --> 01:05:51,368
Yeah? Well, good luck with that, eh?

757
01:05:52,202 --> 01:05:54,663
Look, come on, Sam,
I wouldn't even ask if...

758
01:05:54,705 --> 01:05:58,625
You are joking, ain't you?
After all your no-shows?

759
01:05:58,667 --> 01:06:00,961
I only look stupid.

760
01:06:01,378 --> 01:06:05,632
Look, I messed up.
know, and I'm sorry.

761
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:10,220
Let's just say I didn't appreciate
a good thing when I had it.

762
01:06:10,262 --> 01:06:13,348
- Oh, and now you do?
- Now I do.

763
01:06:26,904 --> 01:06:29,072
Still got your scarf on.

764
01:06:32,242 --> 01:06:33,660
All right, hop on.

765
01:07:31,885 --> 01:07:33,720
All right, I gotta go down the street.

766
01:07:43,147 --> 01:07:44,898
Oi! Mozart!

767
01:07:46,066 --> 01:07:49,153
Yeah. Listen, I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.

768
01:07:49,194 --> 01:07:51,071
Don't muck about.

769
01:08:03,584 --> 01:08:05,836
You can take your whole face off.
My brother once was like,

770
01:08:05,836 --> 01:08:09,923
he was just riding his bicycle,
and he hit this, like, parked car,

771
01:08:09,965 --> 01:08:12,092
and he was so freaked out about
seeing his teeth in the hood,

772
01:08:12,134 --> 01:08:13,760
and, like, his whole face was bleeding

773
01:08:13,802 --> 01:08:17,222
then he got back on the bicycle
and he went to the movies...

774
01:08:18,682 --> 01:08:20,851
Look!
Helleborus orientalis.

775
01:08:20,851 --> 01:08:24,104
They're amazing.
They bloom even in the winter.

776
01:08:24,146 --> 01:08:25,230
Oh, that's cool.

777
01:08:25,272 --> 01:08:28,275
They just pop up without
any help from anyone.

778
01:08:29,109 --> 01:08:32,237
That's like my ex-boyfriend,
if you know what I mean.

779
01:08:34,448 --> 01:08:36,283
You know what I mean, right?

780
01:08:37,117 --> 01:08:38,702
Really?

781
01:08:39,953 --> 01:08:42,539
You don't get out much, do you?

782
01:08:43,290 --> 01:08:45,167
We should talk.

783
01:08:45,876 --> 01:08:48,045
- Another postcard.
- I don't care.

784
01:08:48,086 --> 01:08:50,172
- What's it say?
Went ice skating.

785
01:08:50,214 --> 01:08:51,715
Stop. I don't care.

786
01:08:51,715 --> 01:08:53,800
- Circus.
- It's been months.

787
01:08:54,343 --> 01:08:55,469
Zoo.

788
01:08:55,511 --> 01:08:58,514
How could she be doing all these
things without being seen?

789
01:08:58,555 --> 01:09:00,390
She can't! That's how.

790
01:09:01,642 --> 01:09:03,936
Oh, honey, what are we going to do?

791
01:09:10,317 --> 01:09:12,694
That's her scarf! Look.

792
01:09:32,297 --> 01:09:33,757
No, she went that...

793
01:09:44,184 --> 01:09:46,186
This is really good.

794
01:09:46,186 --> 01:09:49,106
Oh, great. You're here.
It's your turn to buy.

795
01:09:49,523 --> 01:09:51,608
All right, I lied.
I'll buy.

796
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:53,277
Oh, my God!

797
01:09:55,237 --> 01:09:58,157
Somebody pull this scarf off her.
She can't breathe.

798
01:10:38,489 --> 01:10:40,574
They're not running.

799
01:10:44,745 --> 01:10:48,081
Ah! No! Penelope, no!
No, no, no, dear! Turn away!

800
01:10:50,167 --> 01:10:51,752
She's coming out!

801
01:10:52,794 --> 01:10:54,588
There she is!

802
01:10:54,671 --> 01:10:58,509
Penelope, this way!
This way, Penelope!

803
01:10:59,593 --> 01:11:02,513
Is it true you were
chained up in the basement?

804
01:11:03,096 --> 01:11:04,348
Don't encourage them.

805
01:11:04,389 --> 01:11:07,267
Penelope, do you have
any other pig parts?

806
01:11:07,392 --> 01:11:10,312
With such a large nose, do you smell
better than the rest of us?

807
01:11:10,354 --> 01:11:12,189
I don't know. You tell me.

808
01:11:16,902 --> 01:11:18,654
Mom, can I borrow some money?
I'm running low.

809
01:11:18,695 --> 01:11:21,156
Absolutely not.
You get in that car.

810
01:11:21,865 --> 01:11:25,619
Mom, they want to know if you
chained me up in the basement.

811
01:11:26,578 --> 01:11:30,624
Like, after three weeks, I was like,
I knew something was up.

812
01:11:30,666 --> 01:11:32,292
Nose jobs only take
so long, you know.

813
01:11:32,334 --> 01:11:34,503
No, of course not.

814
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:37,214
- Bye, darling.
- Bye.

815
01:11:37,422 --> 01:11:38,549
Let it go, dear.

816
01:11:38,590 --> 01:11:41,051
Penelope, is there anything
you'd like to say to the public?

817
01:11:41,927 --> 01:11:43,053
Er... hi.

818
01:12:08,579 --> 01:12:10,372
Mr Vanderman!

819
01:12:11,123 --> 01:12:13,709
Is it true you attempted to file
assault charges against Penelope?

820
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:15,169
I've obtained
the police report.

821
01:12:15,210 --> 01:12:16,920
No comment, please.
Ladies and gentlemen.

822
01:12:16,962 --> 01:12:18,380
It's OK.
I can handle it.

823
01:12:18,422 --> 01:12:22,593
That woman, that thing,
belongs in a cage.

824
01:12:24,553 --> 01:12:26,847
- What a creep.
- Excuse me.

825
01:12:31,435 --> 01:12:33,020
Have you lost your mind?

826
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:35,606
You saw her.
She's a complete monster.

827
01:12:35,647 --> 01:12:37,774
The public loves this girl.

828
01:12:37,816 --> 01:12:40,819
- They don't know her like I do.
- We're a publicly traded company.

829
01:12:40,861 --> 01:12:43,614
We love what the public loves.
Get it?

830
01:12:46,116 --> 01:12:47,784
So, what are you saying?

831
01:12:47,784 --> 01:12:50,621
I'm saying you've got
to fix this.

832
01:12:50,829 --> 01:12:52,080
I don't know what you
expect me to do.

833
01:12:52,122 --> 01:12:54,374
Just fix it!

834
01:12:55,959 --> 01:12:57,920
Come on, Penelope,
you're on my team!

835
01:12:57,961 --> 01:12:59,796
OK, but I'm not very good.

836
01:13:03,050 --> 01:13:05,010
Come on, come on, come on.

837
01:13:14,478 --> 01:13:16,355
I told you
I wasn't very good.

838
01:13:19,483 --> 01:13:20,984
- Hi.
- Hi.

839
01:13:22,820 --> 01:13:25,322
You really did it, huh?

840
01:13:26,281 --> 01:13:32,955
I mean, er... you look great,
you know, really happy.

841
01:13:33,580 --> 01:13:34,832
Thanks.

842
01:13:36,834 --> 01:13:38,794
Yeah. You know, you inspired me.

843
01:13:39,628 --> 01:13:42,339
Doing what you did, going off
on your own like that.

844
01:13:42,673 --> 01:13:46,009
- I er... I'm not...
- I have to go.

845
01:13:46,510 --> 01:13:49,221
Yeah, sure. I just...

846
01:13:58,063 --> 01:13:59,106
Oh, darling, I am so glad
I found you!

847
01:13:59,148 --> 01:14:00,774
You must come home right now!

848
01:14:01,191 --> 01:14:03,152
I have the most
wonderful surprise.

849
01:14:03,193 --> 01:14:05,070
OK, Mom, but I really
should get back.

850
01:14:07,906 --> 01:14:08,699
Penelope. What is this?

851
01:14:08,699 --> 01:14:13,412
Listen, I'm sorry I ran
from my feelings.

852
01:14:14,163 --> 01:14:15,622
Oh, is that what you were running from?

853
01:14:15,622 --> 01:14:18,542
I was certain you were
running from me.

854
01:14:18,542 --> 01:14:20,586
Only my feelings
for you.

855
01:14:20,627 --> 01:14:24,131
- Is this a joke?
- Penelope, don't make the boy beg.

856
01:14:24,173 --> 01:14:26,717
Look at that face.
He can break the curse.

857
01:14:26,758 --> 01:14:29,261
But things are different now,
Mother. I...

858
01:14:29,303 --> 01:14:30,846
She's overwhelmed.

859
01:14:32,181 --> 01:14:35,100
Why? Because you're splattered
all over the newspapers?

860
01:14:35,142 --> 01:14:36,852
No, because I have friends.

861
01:14:36,894 --> 01:14:39,062
Those aren't friends, dear.
Those are fans.

862
01:14:39,104 --> 01:14:41,273
'Did you hear?
The pig speaks ten languages.'

863
01:14:41,273 --> 01:14:43,942
'Oh, look,
the pig can play the piano.'

864
01:14:44,067 --> 01:14:48,447
You're just a talking pig to
those people. A talking pig.

865
01:14:50,115 --> 01:14:53,243
Edward wants to marry you.

866
01:14:56,371 --> 01:15:00,250
Are you prepared to walk away from
your one and only chance?

867
01:15:00,250 --> 01:15:03,587
Our one and only chance
at a normal life?

868
01:15:13,138 --> 01:15:15,849
Will you marry me, Penelope?

869
01:15:29,738 --> 01:15:31,114
Hey, Lemon.

870
01:15:31,406 --> 01:15:36,829
I thought you might be able to help me
with this Max Campion story I'm doing.

871
01:15:37,371 --> 01:15:39,456
Well, what's the story?

872
01:15:39,456 --> 01:15:43,710
I'm doing this kind of riches to rags
to armed robbery story.

873
01:15:43,752 --> 01:15:45,921
Armed robbery?
Come on? Max Campion?

874
01:15:45,921 --> 01:15:49,132
Yeah. I just got the call.
He's already confessed.

875
01:15:51,218 --> 01:15:52,678
What?

876
01:16:02,688 --> 01:16:03,939
Pick it up.

877
01:16:07,276 --> 01:16:08,694
<i>You the lawyer
my mother sent?</i>

878
01:16:08,735 --> 01:16:11,446
<i>There's been a mistake.
I'm here to see Max Campion.</i>

879
01:16:11,488 --> 01:16:13,073
Yeah, hey, I'm Max Campion.

880
01:16:13,115 --> 01:16:15,492
<i>- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.</i>

881
01:16:15,534 --> 01:16:17,202
<i>No, Max Campion.</i>

882
01:16:17,202 --> 01:16:20,747
<i>I am not deaf. I can hear you.
I am Max Campion.</i>

883
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,376
<i>But you're...</i>

884
01:16:37,598 --> 01:16:42,311
<i>What about the guy
you play poker with?</i>

885
01:16:43,353 --> 01:16:48,025
<i>Shaggy hair,
er... medium build.</i>

886
01:16:48,150 --> 01:16:50,027
Doesn't know when to quit.

887
01:16:51,069 --> 01:16:53,238
<i>Ah! Er... is Johnny Martin.
- Johnny Martin?</i>

888
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:55,866
Johnny Martin.
Poor loser.

889
01:16:55,949 --> 01:16:59,620
<i>Get that down, Martin, in the
pirate pad there</i>

890
01:17:04,124 --> 01:17:05,751
Do you have...? Hey, don't!

891
01:17:23,060 --> 01:17:25,687
Oh, that was so wonderful.
Was it not wonderful?

892
01:17:25,729 --> 01:17:27,356
Yes, wonderful.

893
01:17:28,398 --> 01:17:30,025
We have to do this again.

894
01:17:30,067 --> 01:17:31,819
Now that we're
nearly family,

895
01:17:31,819 --> 01:17:33,695
I think this is just the beginning.

896
01:17:33,737 --> 01:17:35,697
- Yes. I'll fetch the limo.
- Good, good, good.

897
01:17:37,366 --> 01:17:39,451
Can I have my coat,
please?

898
01:17:39,576 --> 01:17:42,913
Oh, Franklin, we used to go out to the
theatre all the time. Why did we stop?

899
01:17:42,913 --> 01:17:45,374
I guess because we had an ugly daughter.

900
01:17:45,415 --> 01:17:47,793
It's true, Jessica.
We gave up everything

901
01:17:48,418 --> 01:17:50,420
because we had an ugly daughter.

902
01:17:50,420 --> 01:17:53,632
- Let me help you with that, sir.
- Thank you.

903
01:17:54,675 --> 01:17:56,969
- It's just over there.
- OK, we're going.

904
01:17:57,511 --> 01:17:59,930
- But my coat!
- Fine, we'll get you another one.

905
01:17:59,972 --> 01:18:02,391
Edward, what are you doing?
Where are we going?

906
01:18:02,599 --> 01:18:05,519
- Max.
- Hello, Penelope.

907
01:18:06,228 --> 01:18:07,729
We were just leaving.

908
01:18:07,729 --> 01:18:10,524
- Hey, how are things, Edward?
- Keep walking.

909
01:18:11,441 --> 01:18:14,278
I understand it got a bit grotesque
there for a while,

910
01:18:14,319 --> 01:18:15,279
even puke ugly.

911
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:17,823
- But... You two know each other?
- As a matter of fact, we do.

912
01:18:17,865 --> 01:18:19,283
Yale, wasn't it?

913
01:18:19,491 --> 01:18:22,703
No, I believe it was a Bedford,
a Bedford van to be...

914
01:18:22,744 --> 01:18:26,039
Stop!
Haven't you hurt her enough?

915
01:18:26,290 --> 01:18:28,250
- Bathroom. Now.
- Edward, I...

916
01:18:28,375 --> 01:18:31,378
- Why don't you let Edward handle this?
- But, Mother...

917
01:18:31,461 --> 01:18:32,504
You make me sick!

918
01:18:32,546 --> 01:18:36,717
Why? I'm giving her exactly
what she wants.

919
01:18:36,925 --> 01:18:39,928
And I don't see anybody else
lining up to do that.

920
01:18:39,970 --> 01:18:42,806
Oh, unless... unless you are.
Are you lining up?

921
01:18:42,848 --> 01:18:45,350
- That's not the point.
- Yeah, it is. Yes, it is the point!

922
01:18:46,727 --> 01:18:49,104
Look, if you want to go out there

923
01:18:49,146 --> 01:18:51,899
and tell her that the only man willing
to stand up and say, 'I do,'

924
01:18:52,024 --> 01:18:56,820
still gags at the thought of kissing her,
then be my guest,

925
01:18:57,863 --> 01:19:00,240
but it's not me
you'll be hurting.

926
01:19:01,408 --> 01:19:03,827
It's her, isn't it?

927
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:18,509
Johnny Martin.

928
01:19:20,719 --> 01:19:24,348
- Son of a plumber, huh?
- It sure took you long enough.

929
01:19:25,808 --> 01:19:28,018
Boy, you sure fooled me.

930
01:19:35,526 --> 01:19:39,780
So, it looks like you were
doing her a favour after all.

931
01:19:40,948 --> 01:19:43,742
- You seen this?
- Hmm. Cute couple.

932
01:19:44,159 --> 01:19:46,328
Yeah. Penelope and the beast.

933
01:19:46,453 --> 01:19:49,164
Hey, they're both getting
what they want, right?

934
01:19:49,206 --> 01:19:51,750
I know what he's getting.
What's she getting?

935
01:19:51,792 --> 01:19:55,128
Well, she's getting the day
she's waited for all her life,

936
01:19:55,128 --> 01:19:57,089
breaking the curse.

937
01:19:57,923 --> 01:20:00,551
Oh, you don't actually believe that,
do you?

938
01:20:00,717 --> 01:20:02,511
Well, don't you?

939
01:20:02,803 --> 01:20:06,056
What the hell have you been
chasing all these years?

940
01:20:06,140 --> 01:20:09,893
I don't know. A wounded ego
and a missing eye, I guess.

941
01:20:09,935 --> 01:20:11,979
Come on, a curse?

942
01:20:12,729 --> 01:20:16,483
Yeah. Who knows? You know, you spend
enough time around a poker table,

943
01:20:16,525 --> 01:20:19,194
you believe in all sorts of things.

944
01:20:19,236 --> 01:20:21,905
Hey, it's not too late
to stop Edward.

945
01:20:21,947 --> 01:20:23,657
That's what she wants.

946
01:20:24,199 --> 01:20:28,495
Wait. If getting married is all it takes
to break the 'ooh, the curse,'...

947
01:20:28,495 --> 01:20:29,788
why not you?

948
01:20:29,830 --> 01:20:32,666
- You're forgetting, man. I'm not Max.
- So?

949
01:20:33,584 --> 01:20:36,003
'One of their own kind'.

950
01:20:59,109 --> 01:21:02,571
Hey! Over here!
I saved you a seat! It's clean.

951
01:21:02,613 --> 01:21:04,656
Hey, Annie, look at you.

952
01:21:09,453 --> 01:21:11,622
Weddings are great, aren't they?

953
01:21:11,747 --> 01:21:14,374
Yeah. When they're
somebody else's.

954
01:21:14,374 --> 01:21:15,626
Jessica,
I need a word.

955
01:21:15,626 --> 01:21:16,210
Excuse me.

956
01:21:16,210 --> 01:21:18,420
What's the matter? Is there a problem?

957
01:21:20,506 --> 01:21:23,008
And Edward seems
really nice.

958
01:21:23,133 --> 01:21:24,968
Mom, I think I'm going to throw up.

959
01:21:25,010 --> 01:21:26,970
Just remember,
in a few minutes from now,

960
01:21:27,012 --> 01:21:29,556
the curse will be broken.

961
01:21:29,890 --> 01:21:33,727
There is no curse. The only one
cursed here is me.

962
01:21:40,734 --> 01:21:44,071
- For starters...
- Losing your eye was your own damn fault.

963
01:21:44,112 --> 01:21:46,365
- Now what?
- I just wanted to apologise.

964
01:21:46,406 --> 01:21:48,242
Apology not accepted.

965
01:21:49,368 --> 01:21:52,496
What?!
I have a wedding to go to!

966
01:21:53,330 --> 01:21:55,249
Meet Johnny Martin.

967
01:22:00,254 --> 01:22:02,631
I told you not to rush
the process.

968
01:22:02,673 --> 01:22:04,508
This doesn't change a thing.

969
01:22:04,591 --> 01:22:07,302
How can you say that?
Not only was Edward part of...

970
01:22:07,344 --> 01:22:10,514
As you yourself once said,
he's still one of our own kind.

971
01:22:10,556 --> 01:22:13,684
OK, fine. What about Max, or Johnny
or whatever his name is?

972
01:22:13,725 --> 01:22:14,268
What about him?

973
01:22:14,309 --> 01:22:16,603
Don't you think Penelope's
entitled to know?

974
01:22:16,645 --> 01:22:17,729
That he lied about everything?

975
01:22:17,771 --> 01:22:20,440
That he doesn't have the
power to break the curse.

976
01:22:20,482 --> 01:22:22,734
Why on earth would
she need to know that?

977
01:22:22,734 --> 01:22:26,530
Don't you see? Maybe that's
the only reason he said no.

978
01:22:26,905 --> 01:22:29,741
I don't know that. You don't know that.
But if that's true,

979
01:22:29,783 --> 01:22:32,786
God bless him,
he did the right thing.

980
01:22:33,287 --> 01:22:36,957
- Damn it, Jessica, I can't just...
- Leave it alone.

981
01:22:38,083 --> 01:22:40,711
Not that I'm not happy for her.
I'm really happy for her.

982
01:22:40,711 --> 01:22:41,920
You're happy for her, right?

983
01:22:41,962 --> 01:22:44,423
- If she's happy, I'm happy.
- Right.

984
01:22:44,464 --> 01:22:47,468
- Mom, I feel stupid.
- Oh, you don't look stupid.

985
01:22:47,509 --> 01:22:48,510
You look...

986
01:22:49,636 --> 01:22:52,055
You don't look stupid.

987
01:23:09,781 --> 01:23:12,409
<i>Do you, Edward Vanderman
take Penelope Wilher</i>

988
01:23:12,409 --> 01:23:15,412
<i>to be your lawfully wedded wife?</i>

989
01:23:16,163 --> 01:23:20,000
<i>To have and to hold,</i>

990
01:23:20,834 --> 01:23:23,754
for better or for worse
for richer or for poorer

991
01:23:23,795 --> 01:23:26,256
in sickness and in health.

992
01:23:26,799 --> 01:23:30,844
To love and to cherish
from this day forward

993
01:23:31,678 --> 01:23:34,181
until death do you part?

994
01:23:37,434 --> 01:23:38,560
I do.

995
01:23:41,396 --> 01:23:44,066
And do you, Penelope Wilhern,

996
01:23:44,942 --> 01:23:47,861
take Edward Humphrey
Vanderman III

997
01:23:48,028 --> 01:23:50,781
to be your lawfully wedded husband,

998
01:23:51,490 --> 01:23:56,578
to have and to hold,
for better or for worse

999
01:23:57,204 --> 01:24:01,291
for richer or for poorer,
in sickness and in health,

1000
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:06,088
to love and to cherish
from this day forward

1001
01:24:06,129 --> 01:24:08,590
until death do you part?

1002
01:24:35,701 --> 01:24:38,203
Nobody move!
She's fine!

1003
01:24:41,248 --> 01:24:44,251
Penelope, wait!
Penelope! Stop!

1004
01:24:45,586 --> 01:24:47,379
Look at me.

1005
01:24:47,421 --> 01:24:48,714
I am.
What is it, dear?

1006
01:24:48,755 --> 01:24:50,215
No, look at me.

1007
01:24:50,215 --> 01:24:53,927
I am! What?
I don't understand! What do you mean?

1008
01:24:55,512 --> 01:24:57,681
You... I'm sorry.

1009
01:25:02,394 --> 01:25:05,022
Penelope, it's not too late.

1010
01:25:05,105 --> 01:25:06,315
Go away, Mother!

1011
01:25:06,356 --> 01:25:08,317
<i>Honey, just think about
what you're doing.</i>

1012
01:25:08,358 --> 01:25:11,069
<i>This is the moment
we have worked so hard for.</i>

1013
01:25:11,069 --> 01:25:12,779
I said go away!

1014
01:25:12,821 --> 01:25:15,616
Sweetheart, please! Please!

1015
01:25:15,616 --> 01:25:18,785
We are one yes away
from a whole new life.

1016
01:25:18,952 --> 01:25:20,412
A whole new you!

1017
01:25:20,454 --> 01:25:22,706
But I don't want a whole new me,
Mother!

1018
01:25:22,748 --> 01:25:25,209
Sweetheart, please! Please!

1019
01:25:25,667 --> 01:25:28,462
I like myself the way I am.

1020
01:26:55,841 --> 01:26:58,135
It's not going to grow back.

1021
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:01,889
- What makes you think I...
- I miss it too.

1022
01:27:02,306 --> 01:27:05,142
And then I remember
you're still you.

1023
01:27:13,984 --> 01:27:15,235
Oh, Penelope...

1024
01:27:16,695 --> 01:27:19,740
'One of your own kind.'
I just assumed...

1025
01:27:20,574 --> 01:27:22,284
No, we all did, Mother.

1026
01:27:22,326 --> 01:27:24,578
No, dear.
No. Don't you see?

1027
01:27:24,620 --> 01:27:27,122
I could have broken
the curse years ago

1028
01:27:27,164 --> 01:27:29,625
if I'd just done my job
as your mother,

1029
01:27:29,666 --> 01:27:31,710
and loved you as my own.

1030
01:27:31,752 --> 01:27:34,213
You didn't know.
You didn't know.

1031
01:27:50,270 --> 01:27:51,522
Oh, look.

1032
01:27:53,106 --> 01:27:56,401
You know, darling, with the
carotid artery out of the way,

1033
01:27:56,735 --> 01:28:01,532
I think a little turn up might,
right there, be sweet. Look at that.

1034
01:28:01,615 --> 01:28:04,660
What?
You're crazy.

1035
01:28:07,287 --> 01:28:10,999
Oh, it's wrong for a young woman
to want to look her best?

1036
01:28:11,041 --> 01:28:12,793
That's not a bad thing...

1037
01:28:12,876 --> 01:28:15,045
What?
I'm being her mother.

1038
01:28:15,087 --> 01:28:17,589
That's what mothers do
with daughters!

1039
01:28:17,631 --> 01:28:19,967
They talk about how
to look prettier.

1040
01:28:19,967 --> 01:28:22,469
<i>Still, I felt sad
for my mother that day...</i>

1041
01:28:22,469 --> 01:28:25,139
Why are you turning it around?
Oh, now I'm the bad guy!

1042
01:28:25,180 --> 01:28:27,808
<i>... having to cope with so many
changes all at once.</i>

1043
01:28:27,850 --> 01:28:29,810
It all went back to shit!

1044
01:28:29,852 --> 01:28:31,645
<i>I was packing to go,</i>

1045
01:28:31,645 --> 01:28:35,107
and after 25 years
with the family...

1046
01:28:35,149 --> 01:28:38,318
Jake, where are you going?
Jake, I'm talking to you. Jake?

1047
01:28:38,360 --> 01:28:40,946
And why do you have that bag?
Jake! Don't be rude!

1048
01:28:40,988 --> 01:28:43,574
You turn around when
I'm talking to you, please.

1049
01:28:43,574 --> 01:28:45,325
I happen to be...

1050
01:28:57,754 --> 01:29:01,675
There, there, now. There, there.

1051
01:29:32,956 --> 01:29:37,044
<i>But I had my own changes
to cope with,</i>

1052
01:29:38,212 --> 01:29:40,047
<i>and, while I missed the face</i>

1053
01:29:40,088 --> 01:29:41,715
<i>that had caused
so much trouble...</i>

1054
01:29:44,968 --> 01:29:47,888
<i>... the world had
moved on.</i>

1055
01:29:50,891 --> 01:29:54,478
<i>... and I was determined
to find my own way,</i>

1056
01:29:55,604 --> 01:29:58,649
<i>and determined to always
follow my heart...</i>

1057
01:29:58,649 --> 01:30:00,734
Look! My daffodil bloomed!

1058
01:30:00,734 --> 01:30:03,737
And I found
Helleborus orientalis!

1059
01:30:04,655 --> 01:30:06,448
<i>... and my conscience.</i>

1060
01:30:07,991 --> 01:30:11,328
<i>Dear Edward, that first
day in the library,</i>

1061
01:30:11,370 --> 01:30:15,374
<i>you said that you too have felt
imprisoned most of your life.</i>

1062
01:30:15,415 --> 01:30:19,378
<i>Looking back, I now believe you
were speaking from your heart.</i>

1063
01:30:19,419 --> 01:30:22,381
<i>I fear I did you a terrible
disservice that day</i>

1064
01:30:22,422 --> 01:30:25,509
<i>I knew you would run
I wanted you to,</i>

1065
01:30:25,509 --> 01:30:29,513
<i>but perhaps if I had taken
the time to really listen to you,</i>

1066
01:30:29,680 --> 01:30:32,599
<i>maybe we could have helped
each other find our way.</i>

1067
01:30:32,599 --> 01:30:37,521
<i>I'm sorry. I hope this letter
and this ring finds you well.</i>

1068
01:30:45,112 --> 01:30:50,033
Edward? Edward? Your father wants
to know what you're doing in there.

1069
01:30:53,162 --> 01:30:54,997
<i>And then came Halloween.</i>

1070
01:30:55,038 --> 01:30:56,373
Okay, everybody. We're going to start
in about ten minutes, so I need you

1071
01:30:56,415 --> 01:30:58,292
all to go and get your costumes on. OK?

1072
01:30:59,209 --> 01:31:03,797
Just get changed and line up
by the front door as quick as possible.

1073
01:31:04,089 --> 01:31:06,091
Hey! Hey! No fighting.

1074
01:31:06,175 --> 01:31:09,178
- I can be whoever I want!
- Girls, please.

1075
01:31:09,219 --> 01:31:12,139
But she knew I was
going to be Penelope.

1076
01:31:14,558 --> 01:31:18,896
All right, girls, you're going to have to
go out with the rest of the class.

1077
01:31:18,937 --> 01:31:22,900
Go and line up. Come on, line up.
Get ready to go. Come on.

1078
01:31:24,026 --> 01:31:26,820
Alice?
Honey, what's wrong?

1079
01:31:27,070 --> 01:31:31,283
Everybody's Penelope,
and I'm a stupid static cling!

1080
01:31:31,325 --> 01:31:35,496
Oh... Well, frankly,
I find you quite refreshing.

1081
01:31:35,913 --> 01:31:40,000
Come on, sweetie. Stick with me
and we'll both make it through this.

1082
01:31:42,669 --> 01:31:45,005
Trick or treat!

1083
01:31:45,005 --> 01:31:46,423
Well, hello there.

1084
01:31:47,382 --> 01:31:51,345
- I love this one. These are my favourites.
- Jess, you're going to want to see this.

1085
01:31:51,553 --> 01:31:53,639
Is this too much?

1086
01:31:57,392 --> 01:31:58,852
Bye.

1087
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:10,447
<i>And then Wanda couldn't hold on
to the secret any longer.</i>

1088
01:32:35,556 --> 01:32:40,060
You're everywhere.
Are you freaking out or what?

1089
01:32:41,186 --> 01:32:43,897
- OK, 357.
- There it is.

1090
01:32:44,940 --> 01:32:46,316
Hold on.

1091
01:32:46,900 --> 01:32:48,402
What?

1092
01:32:49,236 --> 01:32:52,239
It's just kind of great
to see the old you.

1093
01:32:52,322 --> 01:32:54,950
- OK. All right, let's go.
- All right, here we go.

1094
01:32:56,076 --> 01:32:58,829
You can do this.
Are you ready?

1095
01:33:07,045 --> 01:33:08,839
Hi. Um... I...

1096
01:33:09,756 --> 01:33:14,011
She's gotta pee. You got a bathroom?
I'm going to get some punch.

1097
01:33:16,930 --> 01:33:21,518
Er... yeah. Yeah, sure. I guess it's OK.
Come on in.

1098
01:33:28,734 --> 01:33:30,819
<i>It looks like a good party.</i>

1099
01:33:32,488 --> 01:33:34,448
<i>Why aren't you at the party?</i>

1100
01:33:34,573 --> 01:33:36,366
I gotta pack.

1101
01:33:36,366 --> 01:33:38,202
So, are you moving?

1102
01:33:40,621 --> 01:33:45,709
Er... out-of-town job. I felt like
getting out of the city for a while.

1103
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:50,130
<i>Away from the crowds?</i>

1104
01:33:50,631 --> 01:33:53,634
Yeah, the crowds
at the poker tables.

1105
01:33:54,301 --> 01:33:56,136
Oh, so you're a gambler?

1106
01:33:56,261 --> 01:33:59,890
Ex.
Avoiding temptation.

1107
01:34:04,728 --> 01:34:05,854
Well, that's good.

1108
01:34:07,314 --> 01:34:08,649
Good for you. I er...

1109
01:34:10,234 --> 01:34:14,488
I had a friend once
who um... liked to gamble.

1110
01:34:14,613 --> 01:34:16,865
At least, well, I heard
he liked to gamble,

1111
01:34:16,907 --> 01:34:20,244
- And, he had to stay away from...
- Take off the mask.

1112
01:34:21,912 --> 01:34:23,247
What?

1113
01:34:24,832 --> 01:34:26,291
I'm sorry.

1114
01:34:28,377 --> 01:34:30,879
All Halloween,
I've been running into...

1115
01:34:31,004 --> 01:34:37,261
well, someone I used to know.
Sorry. Ridiculous.

1116
01:34:41,723 --> 01:34:45,269
This someone,
she meant a lot to you?

1117
01:34:47,563 --> 01:34:48,522
Yes.

1118
01:34:51,316 --> 01:34:52,568
Yes, she did.

1119
01:34:54,361 --> 01:34:55,904
What happened?

1120
01:34:58,282 --> 01:35:01,118
I couldn't give her
what she wanted.

1121
01:35:01,618 --> 01:35:03,412
What did she want?

1122
01:35:07,583 --> 01:35:09,126
To be free.

1123
01:35:10,794 --> 01:35:12,171
You shit!

1124
01:35:12,212 --> 01:35:16,049
You lied to me!
I guessed piano, and you said...

1125
01:35:24,475 --> 01:35:27,728
- Penelope, I'm sorry.
- I know.

1126
01:35:27,895 --> 01:35:31,231
No. I don't have the power
to break the curse.

1127
01:35:31,982 --> 01:35:35,527
It's OK.
It turns out that I did.

1128
01:35:36,987 --> 01:35:38,447
It's me, Max.

1129
01:35:40,407 --> 01:35:42,618
My name's Johnny.

1130
01:35:43,452 --> 01:35:48,665
I know. Johnny.
I'm still me.

1131
01:36:15,275 --> 01:36:16,944
<i>So, there we were.</i>

1132
01:36:19,029 --> 01:36:21,615
<i>And we lived happily
ever after.</i>

1133
01:36:23,784 --> 01:36:27,371
Well, happily ever after
so far at least.

1134
01:36:27,538 --> 01:36:29,873
I don't get it.
What does it mean?

1135
01:36:30,290 --> 01:36:34,211
- Well, what do you think it means?
- Rich people suck!

1136
01:36:34,628 --> 01:36:37,047
It's always the mother's fault.

1137
01:36:38,382 --> 01:36:40,259
We're all cursed?

1138
01:36:40,300 --> 01:36:44,138
It's not the power of the curse,
it's the power you give the curse.

1139
01:36:44,179 --> 01:36:47,474
- What did you say, Shrimp?
- He's not a shrimp, dummy.

1140
01:36:47,558 --> 01:36:50,477
- He is too a shrimp!
- Hey! That's not nice!

1141
01:36:51,311 --> 01:36:52,980
That's very good, Billy.

1142
01:36:53,814 --> 01:36:57,401
OK, they're serving snacks
down at the picnic tables.

1143
01:36:57,401 --> 01:36:59,570
Then, after break,
we'll go explore,

1144
01:36:59,611 --> 01:37:01,864
and see what you can collect.

1145
01:37:05,617 --> 01:37:07,411
Stay together.

1146
01:38:09,973 --> 01:38:11,016
