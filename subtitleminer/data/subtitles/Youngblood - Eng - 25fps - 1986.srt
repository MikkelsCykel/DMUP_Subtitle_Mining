1
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:19,850
Get 'em, Jack!

2
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:25,606
Yeah!

3
00:00:28,238 --> 00:00:31,690
- Come on! Up and down!
- Get the little runt!

4
00:00:37,414 --> 00:00:40,166
- Goddammit!
- (cheering)

5
00:00:40,292 --> 00:00:43,080
Go ahead, Bobby.

6
00:00:43,212 --> 00:00:46,332
(man) Hey, kids, cut it out. Come on.

7
00:00:46,465 --> 00:00:49,799
Break it up. Break it up. Kelly!

8
00:00:49,927 --> 00:00:54,056
Come on, Kelly. Break it up.
Cut it out. That's enough.

9
00:03:56,753 --> 00:04:01,499
I've been offered a tryout
with the Hamilton Mustangs.

10
00:04:03,636 --> 00:04:05,676
All right, Deaner.

11
00:04:05,805 --> 00:04:11,724
They came to one of my games. They've
got one spot open for their play-offs.

12
00:04:15,482 --> 00:04:19,397
- There's too much work to be done here.
- Dad, I can't wait any more.

13
00:04:19,528 --> 00:04:23,525
I gotta play junior if I'm ever gonna
play pro. All the scouts'll be there.

14
00:04:23,657 --> 00:04:27,441
I can't afford to hire someone
in your place.

15
00:04:28,704 --> 00:04:31,908
I figure maybe we could get a tractor
with my bonus money.

16
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:34,532
Yeah. Like with Kelly's bonus?

17
00:04:34,669 --> 00:04:40,874
All he ended up with was a stick in the eye
and a $2,000 doctor bill.

18
00:04:42,344 --> 00:04:45,262
I'll pick up the slack, Pop.

19
00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:48,924
Yeah, how long do you think that'll last?

20
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:54,387
I don't wanna be a goddamn farmer
the rest of my life.

21
00:04:55,859 --> 00:05:00,236
- He's just a smart-ass kid.
- We all were... for the first week.

22
00:05:00,363 --> 00:05:04,028
- He's so goddamn small.
- He'll grow.

23
00:05:04,159 --> 00:05:06,615
In a week?

24
00:05:06,745 --> 00:05:12,500
Let him go. He'll be back in two weeks
dragging his tail between his legs.

25
00:05:18,591 --> 00:05:22,720
(Kelly) Now, there's one thing
you're gonna have to learn.

26
00:05:23,555 --> 00:05:26,721
O Canada!

27
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:30,599
Our home and native land!

28
00:05:30,729 --> 00:05:33,731
True patriot love

29
00:05:33,858 --> 00:05:37,108
In all thy sons command

30
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:39,941
With glowing hearts we see thee rise

31
00:05:40,072 --> 00:05:43,157
Our True North strong and free!

32
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:51,663
(Kelly) Hamilton Arena.

33
00:05:58,926 --> 00:06:00,966
He scores!

34
00:06:04,891 --> 00:06:06,800
You wanna come in?

35
00:06:06,935 --> 00:06:10,434
What? Hold your fucking hand, huh?

36
00:06:14,151 --> 00:06:16,274
You're on your own.

37
00:06:19,031 --> 00:06:20,858
Hey.

38
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:29,948
Thanks.

39
00:06:30,084 --> 00:06:34,414
Forget it. You're worthless
around there anyway.

40
00:06:37,676 --> 00:06:40,084
Don't take any shit from them Canucks.

41
00:06:40,221 --> 00:06:44,170
To them, you're another wetback
crossin' the border to play their game.

42
00:06:44,308 --> 00:06:47,891
- They'll never catch me.
- They'll catch you.

43
00:07:04,789 --> 00:07:07,955
Where'd you get
these guys from, Ray? Mexico?

44
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:12,461
(Ray) We're only looking for one player.

45
00:07:12,589 --> 00:07:16,207
Like that sorry son of a bitch
who just tripped over the blue line?

46
00:07:33,694 --> 00:07:38,938
Carl Racki. Six feet, 198 pounds. Played
tier two in the Western League last year.

47
00:07:39,075 --> 00:07:46,206
15 goals, 22 assists and - whoo! -
378 minutes in penalties!

48
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:48,914
(whistle blows)

49
00:07:49,044 --> 00:07:51,583
(referee) Help out! Help out!

50
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:15,194
Dean Youngblood.
Five foot ten inches, 160 pounds.

51
00:08:15,323 --> 00:08:18,858
He's 17 years old.
He's an American kid from Stanton.

52
00:08:18,993 --> 00:08:23,206
Scored 92 goals this year so far
for the Stanton Flyers.

53
00:08:23,332 --> 00:08:26,831
125 assists and 14 minutes in penalties.

54
00:08:29,296 --> 00:08:31,752
That's Kelly's kid brother.

55
00:08:40,308 --> 00:08:42,550
Come on! Somebody hit the hot dog.

56
00:08:51,361 --> 00:08:55,573
- Why doesn't somebody hit him?
- They can't catch him.

57
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:00,245
Put Racki across from him.

58
00:09:39,372 --> 00:09:42,041
- Look at him.
- He's goin' for it.

59
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:52,671
- Stay down.
- Stay down.

60
00:09:53,094 --> 00:09:57,840
- Keep your head up, prick.
- Look where the puck is, asshole.

61
00:09:57,975 --> 00:10:00,264
Wanna go, pretty boy?

62
00:10:03,147 --> 00:10:05,851
Come on, come on, come on.

63
00:10:07,401 --> 00:10:09,643
Let's go.

64
00:10:14,951 --> 00:10:17,241
- He's outta here.
- Pup.

65
00:10:18,872 --> 00:10:21,161
(referee) Come on, take it easy.

66
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:23,699
Bring him down to the other end.
You all right?

67
00:10:23,836 --> 00:10:25,829
- Yeah.
- You sure?

68
00:10:26,631 --> 00:10:29,383
What do you think, Murray?

69
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:32,924
He fights like an old lady.

70
00:10:33,304 --> 00:10:35,676
("I'm A Real Man" by John Hiatt)

71
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:03,409
- Looks good for about six.
- (player) Six? Come on, ten.

72
00:11:03,545 --> 00:11:05,752
- Where's the doc?
- What doc?

73
00:11:05,881 --> 00:11:08,836
- The one who's gonna sew my eye.
- You're looking at him.

74
00:11:08,967 --> 00:11:10,877
(laughter)

75
00:11:13,222 --> 00:11:16,757
Let's see. Where is the little bugger?

76
00:11:16,893 --> 00:11:18,601
Here we go.

77
00:11:18,728 --> 00:11:23,189
I do needlepoint too.
That's one of mine.

78
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:24,858
Pretty good, huh?

79
00:11:24,985 --> 00:11:28,817
We got a team doctor
but he can't tie his shoelaces.

80
00:11:28,947 --> 00:11:32,281
A player gets cut,
he takes 30 minutes to close him up.

81
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:35,695
By that time, the guy's lost
15 minutes of the game.

82
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:40,706
So, anyway, Murray bought me this kit
and told me to learn.

83
00:11:40,835 --> 00:11:45,249
The first month
he stood beside me with a stopwatch.

84
00:11:46,175 --> 00:11:47,549
Yeah.

85
00:11:48,843 --> 00:11:53,471
Your eyes are better than mine.
Once I get it threaded, I'm OK.

86
00:11:53,599 --> 00:11:56,719
- (player) Mad butcher of Hamilton.
- Oh.

87
00:11:57,353 --> 00:12:00,888
I'm out of Novocain,
so this may hurt a little.

88
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,653
OK.

89
00:12:09,783 --> 00:12:11,823
Here we go.

90
00:12:27,135 --> 00:12:30,219
Nothing to it.
Just like zipping up your pants.

91
00:12:32,891 --> 00:12:35,299
Six stitches, five minutes.

92
00:12:35,436 --> 00:12:39,516
Pretty good. Next year
we'll have you doing transplants.

93
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:46,478
Get him a uniform.

94
00:12:46,614 --> 00:12:49,106
(player) Yeah, a nurse's uniform.

95
00:12:49,242 --> 00:12:52,409
Better make it extra small, Frazier.

96
00:12:57,626 --> 00:13:00,082
- (Murray) Can I talk to you?
- (Racki) Yeah.

97
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:04,423
I'm gonna go with the other kid. I need
someone who can put the puck in the net.

98
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,293
That pipsqueak?

99
00:13:06,427 --> 00:13:11,054
Maybe you can catch on with another
team. I only have one spot for the playoffs.

100
00:13:11,182 --> 00:13:17,055
- I kicked his ass all over the rink.
- But you're not as fast as he is.

101
00:13:17,188 --> 00:13:20,688
Don't worry. You'll be seeing me around.

102
00:13:22,194 --> 00:13:23,819
(players) Ooh!

103
00:13:27,241 --> 00:13:29,317
Save some of that for the ice, huh?

104
00:13:29,451 --> 00:13:33,200
All right. Mustangs out on the rink
in five minutes.

105
00:13:33,331 --> 00:13:35,787
(player) Go get him, killer.

106
00:13:49,181 --> 00:13:51,174
Shit!

107
00:14:02,738 --> 00:14:05,490
New uniforms for the playoffs?

108
00:14:08,952 --> 00:14:10,328
Nice.

109
00:14:23,385 --> 00:14:25,424
Fuck.

110
00:14:35,731 --> 00:14:38,982
The locker room is that way.

111
00:15:14,189 --> 00:15:18,567
I think he needs a shave.
What do you think, guys?

112
00:15:23,741 --> 00:15:27,241
- I already shaved.
- When? Last week?

113
00:15:29,664 --> 00:15:33,248
Don't think he knows what we mean.

114
00:15:35,254 --> 00:15:39,038
I think he's gonna do something funny.

115
00:15:39,174 --> 00:15:43,220
No. I think he's gonna... bolt!

116
00:15:44,931 --> 00:15:48,265
- You're goin' nowhere!
- On the table.

117
00:15:50,436 --> 00:15:52,975
Ding, ding! Paging Dr Sutton.

118
00:15:54,024 --> 00:15:56,942
The doctor is here. Scalpel.

119
00:15:57,069 --> 00:15:59,441
- Scalpel.
- Scalpel.

120
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:04,611
Go for it. You wanted a doctor.

121
00:16:05,161 --> 00:16:08,032
- Shaving cream.
- Shaving cream.

122
00:16:09,499 --> 00:16:15,454
Hold him still, boys. We don't want
another Victor Gunderson incident.

123
00:16:15,588 --> 00:16:19,752
Poor Victoria.
And he had so much potential.

124
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:25,135
Looky, looky!
This shouldn't take long at all.

125
00:16:28,644 --> 00:16:31,100
Press hard, Derek, it's really dull.

126
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,689
OK.

127
00:17:08,604 --> 00:17:10,015
Yes?

128
00:17:10,147 --> 00:17:13,232
You must be one of Murray's boys.

129
00:17:16,196 --> 00:17:18,235
Come on in.

130
00:17:22,786 --> 00:17:24,743
I swear to God,

131
00:17:24,871 --> 00:17:28,952
sometimes I don't know whether I'm
running a boarding house or a hospital.

132
00:17:29,085 --> 00:17:32,168
More of Mr Frazier's embroidery.

133
00:17:33,255 --> 00:17:36,210
- What's your name, honey?
- Excuse me.

134
00:17:36,342 --> 00:17:38,216
I'm Dean Youngblood.

135
00:17:38,344 --> 00:17:42,010
Right. I'll show you your room, Dean.

136
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:47,347
And then I'll show you the second most
important room in the house, the kitchen.

137
00:17:47,479 --> 00:17:50,564
By the way, I'm Miss McGill.

138
00:18:00,868 --> 00:18:02,861
(Miss McGill) Dean!

139
00:18:02,996 --> 00:18:04,989
Yep.

140
00:18:05,123 --> 00:18:07,662
Can you get the door, honey?

141
00:18:22,641 --> 00:18:27,185
I thought you might like a nice cup of tea.

142
00:18:27,313 --> 00:18:30,647
I do like all my boys to be comfortable.

143
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,816
There we are.

144
00:18:36,531 --> 00:18:39,402
Well, you're settling in, I see.

145
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,329
Goal.

146
00:18:46,877 --> 00:18:49,165
Shit. Excuse me.

147
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:54,456
It might be a little bit warm.
Here, we can let it cool down.

148
00:19:05,313 --> 00:19:07,555
You know, Dean,

149
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:13,360
I've been boarding hockey players
in this house for over ten years.

150
00:19:14,405 --> 00:19:16,979
These are some of my boys.

151
00:19:17,117 --> 00:19:20,154
Fred "The Hammer" Murphy.

152
00:19:20,287 --> 00:19:24,914
Defence. Six three, 210.

153
00:19:25,043 --> 00:19:27,081
Great thighs.

154
00:19:29,338 --> 00:19:32,459
Big shot from the point,
averaged only about 10 goals a year,

155
00:19:32,592 --> 00:19:35,380
but, boy, you remembered
every single one of them.

156
00:19:35,512 --> 00:19:40,470
St Louis, Detroit, Chicago, New York.

157
00:19:41,518 --> 00:19:44,472
They say he has an attitude problem.

158
00:19:44,605 --> 00:19:47,559
I always thought he was wonderful.

159
00:19:50,653 --> 00:19:53,524
(Miss McGill) One, two, three...

160
00:19:58,578 --> 00:20:00,702
She do it to me last year.

161
00:20:00,831 --> 00:20:03,701
She do it to me last night.

162
00:20:12,552 --> 00:20:16,596
The only thing better than
a glass of beer is tea with Miss McGill.

163
00:20:17,473 --> 00:20:18,718
Baf, baf, baf!

164
00:20:23,271 --> 00:20:26,392
Hey, I saw you try out.
You've got speed.

165
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:27,688
Thanks.

166
00:20:27,818 --> 00:20:30,225
Fast legs, slow fists.

167
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:32,936
- That guy suckered me.
- Poor baby.

168
00:20:33,073 --> 00:20:37,321
Maybe next time we can send you
a telegram. "Get ready for the right hook."

169
00:20:37,453 --> 00:20:40,159
Racki's brutal even for this league.

170
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:43,207
That man, he's fucking an animal.

171
00:20:44,627 --> 00:20:47,913
Hey, cheers! Miss McGill!

172
00:20:57,266 --> 00:21:01,015
A round of tequila.
Con limones de cojones!

173
00:21:14,451 --> 00:21:16,859
To the game
and getting out of this hick town.

174
00:21:16,996 --> 00:21:20,495
Thank God there is still a sport
for middle-sized white boys.

175
00:21:20,624 --> 00:21:21,953
Amen!

176
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:28,674
Lightweight.

177
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,500
- Learn to take a drink, man.
- Fuck, I'm sorry.

178
00:21:36,725 --> 00:21:38,765
Yo! Another round.

179
00:21:41,189 --> 00:21:43,810
Local talent at three o'clock.

180
00:21:43,942 --> 00:21:45,981
Anybody we know?

181
00:21:48,321 --> 00:21:51,406
You take the one with the moustache.

182
00:21:53,368 --> 00:21:56,702
- Ladies, hi.
- Hi.

183
00:21:56,831 --> 00:21:59,866
- Good to see you.
- Hi.

184
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,045
- I saw every game last year.
- I missed just one. That's cos I was sick.

185
00:22:04,171 --> 00:22:07,042
I missed three cos of haemorrhoids.

186
00:22:09,177 --> 00:22:13,590
What's so funny?
I had to have surgery. I'll show you.

187
00:22:13,723 --> 00:22:17,306
- Not right now, please.
- Maybe after a few more drinks.

188
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:18,764
Maureen.

189
00:22:36,122 --> 00:22:37,866
- Oh, look!
- What?

190
00:22:42,087 --> 00:22:46,002
- (Maureen) I don't see anything.
- No, I guess not.

191
00:22:48,136 --> 00:22:50,175
So, bottoms up?

192
00:22:56,561 --> 00:22:58,601
(screams)

193
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:15,866
I was wondering where those things were.

194
00:23:17,792 --> 00:23:22,953
- Yo! Two Bloody Marys!
- Tequila once again for the second time!

195
00:23:26,218 --> 00:23:28,044
Cheers.

196
00:23:28,762 --> 00:23:31,134
Cheers, man.

197
00:23:32,183 --> 00:23:34,639
(man) Hey, goddammit! Watch it!

198
00:23:42,318 --> 00:23:44,644
Ready?

199
00:23:44,779 --> 00:23:47,318
Cheers.

200
00:23:47,449 --> 00:23:51,448
(player) Cheers. Come on, let's go.
We're just gettin' started.

201
00:23:51,579 --> 00:23:53,618
Cheers!

202
00:24:08,221 --> 00:24:11,139
(whistle)

203
00:24:20,735 --> 00:24:23,273
Lookin' good, rookie!

204
00:24:45,428 --> 00:24:47,753
Fuck me.

205
00:25:11,706 --> 00:25:14,743
Youngblood and Sutton.

206
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:22,874
- (player) Eat him up, Derek.
- Go get him, Sutton.

207
00:25:24,136 --> 00:25:26,674
(Murray) Let's see who wants it!

208
00:25:38,527 --> 00:25:41,481
(player) Back to the pond, rookie!

209
00:25:47,453 --> 00:25:52,199
All right? Come on.
You better take a break.

210
00:25:52,333 --> 00:25:57,375
Want some milk and cookies
or something? How about a little nap?

211
00:25:59,049 --> 00:26:03,841
Can I ask you a question?
How'd you get so horseshit in one day?

212
00:26:04,888 --> 00:26:08,554
- Maybe I made a mistake about you.
- I don't think so.

213
00:26:08,684 --> 00:26:12,551
You better know so. This isn't
some recreational hockey league.

214
00:26:12,688 --> 00:26:16,936
If you wanna be here tomorrow,
you better show me more than right now.

215
00:26:17,068 --> 00:26:19,986
Get out there! Go!

216
00:26:45,098 --> 00:26:46,676
How was it?

217
00:26:46,809 --> 00:26:50,936
It's your type of film. You'd love it.

218
00:26:51,063 --> 00:26:55,013
- I can't stand the sight of blood.
- Unless it's your own, right?

219
00:26:55,151 --> 00:26:58,105
That's right.

220
00:26:58,237 --> 00:27:01,274
- Want some popcorn?
- Sure.

221
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,197
See you around.

222
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:02,179
Book of the Month selection?

223
00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:04,346
I guess.

224
00:28:09,397 --> 00:28:11,473
- Here.
- Heavy.

225
00:28:11,608 --> 00:28:16,567
And no pictures. I'll buy it for you.
It'll give you something to do on the bus.

226
00:28:16,697 --> 00:28:18,737
And in bed.

227
00:28:25,873 --> 00:28:27,913
Thank you.

228
00:28:28,042 --> 00:28:30,284
And this.

229
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,246
Thanks.

230
00:28:35,341 --> 00:28:39,387
I think all hockey players
should know how to read and write.

231
00:28:39,513 --> 00:28:42,467
- Ah, shit. The coach.
- Shit.

232
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,427
Dad.

233
00:28:45,602 --> 00:28:47,891
Dad?

234
00:28:48,022 --> 00:28:49,600
Fuck me.

235
00:28:52,527 --> 00:28:54,436
Hi, Dad.

236
00:28:54,988 --> 00:28:58,736
- What's going on here?
- We met at the theatre.

237
00:28:58,867 --> 00:29:03,944
Well, in front of the theatre.
We were there together. Separately.

238
00:29:04,081 --> 00:29:07,996
We went to the bookstore.
She bought me a book.

239
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:24,137
I see. Look, it's a quarter to ten.
You want a lift home?

240
00:29:28,482 --> 00:29:30,522
I'll be home later.

241
00:29:31,819 --> 00:29:33,859
10.30.

242
00:29:43,915 --> 00:29:48,163
I'm sorry. I probably got you into trouble.
I should have gone home with him.

243
00:29:48,295 --> 00:29:50,418
No.

244
00:29:50,547 --> 00:29:56,135
It's just been kinda hard
to meet people I can talk to up here.

245
00:29:56,262 --> 00:29:59,881
- Where's down there?
- The city.

246
00:30:00,016 --> 00:30:02,423
Buffalo?

247
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:05,431
- New York.
- Yeah.

248
00:30:05,563 --> 00:30:07,603
I've heard of it.

249
00:30:10,027 --> 00:30:14,985
I like a man who's been around.
I grew up there when Dad was playing.

250
00:30:15,115 --> 00:30:18,900
My mom's still there.
She's remarried to some jerk.

251
00:30:19,036 --> 00:30:21,492
Pardon me - rich jerk.

252
00:30:22,707 --> 00:30:25,163
I've only been up here a couple of years.

253
00:30:25,293 --> 00:30:29,125
You oughta spend a Saturday night
in Stanton sometime.

254
00:30:29,255 --> 00:30:31,747
No, thank you.

255
00:30:31,883 --> 00:30:34,457
It's not like Murray doesn't try.

256
00:30:34,595 --> 00:30:39,304
He made me stick boy for the team, then
he wouldn't let me into the locker room.

257
00:30:39,433 --> 00:30:41,758
I can't imagine why not.

258
00:30:41,894 --> 00:30:44,350
Now he's got me on the Zamboni.

259
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:49,523
My big goal in life is to do the ice
at Madison Square Garden.

260
00:30:50,612 --> 00:30:52,854
At least you have a reason to be here.

261
00:30:52,989 --> 00:30:55,315
Where else could I get
beaten up every day,

262
00:30:55,450 --> 00:31:00,908
treated like shit by a bunch of prima
donna Canadians, get my nuts shaved...

263
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,911
Don't worry.
It grows back.

264
00:31:05,836 --> 00:31:08,921
At least you still have your own teeth.

265
00:31:12,719 --> 00:31:14,130
Or don't you?

266
00:31:16,056 --> 00:31:18,629
Yep, still mine.

267
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:30,441
Look... I think you're real nice
and got a cute ass,

268
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:39,281
but I don't think it's a good idea
if we see each other. OK?

269
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:47,210
Thanks for the book.

270
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:50,839
Sure.

271
00:31:55,848 --> 00:31:59,134
You're sure you don't want me
to walk you home?

272
00:32:00,187 --> 00:32:01,764
No.

273
00:32:01,897 --> 00:32:04,602
It's kinda hard to get lost in this town.

274
00:32:22,877 --> 00:32:24,704
(rock music)

275
00:32:33,765 --> 00:32:37,596
- This'll hurt me more than it'll hurt you.
- Yeah, right.

276
00:32:50,157 --> 00:32:52,565
What's with the rose?

277
00:32:52,701 --> 00:32:55,822
Fan club. Toronto chapter.

278
00:32:55,955 --> 00:32:57,995
Yeah?

279
00:33:03,213 --> 00:33:04,672
Got any more?

280
00:33:11,764 --> 00:33:13,803
(music stops)

281
00:33:13,932 --> 00:33:15,972
(hairdryer buzzes)

282
00:33:21,316 --> 00:33:26,476
How can you be thinking about the game
when you're styling your hair?

283
00:33:29,241 --> 00:33:30,521
Shit.

284
00:33:32,369 --> 00:33:36,747
Sometimes I wonder
if players today have it in here.

285
00:33:36,874 --> 00:33:39,958
You know what Gordie Howe's
bonus was when he signed?

286
00:33:40,085 --> 00:33:42,541
A jacket. A team jacket.

287
00:33:42,672 --> 00:33:44,499
Lousy agent.

288
00:33:44,632 --> 00:33:50,836
Now everybody wants a 20-year no-cut
contract and a second home in Bora Bora.

289
00:33:50,972 --> 00:33:52,003
Where's that?

290
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,512
The way you looked at practice this week,

291
00:33:54,643 --> 00:33:59,519
you'll be lucky if you're drafted
by the Tallahassee Warthogs.

292
00:33:59,649 --> 00:34:03,598
You wanna go back to the farms?
And the mills and the mines?

293
00:34:03,736 --> 00:34:09,407
If you don't, you better start thinking
about this game right now.

294
00:34:11,661 --> 00:34:16,204
We'll start with Zeeny's line.
Hewitt and Weber on defence.

295
00:34:16,333 --> 00:34:19,369
Youngblood, take left wing
on Sutton's line.

296
00:34:21,714 --> 00:34:23,956
(cheering and whistling)

297
00:34:38,565 --> 00:34:40,605
Come on, Derek!

298
00:34:48,743 --> 00:34:49,739
Fuck!

299
00:34:59,921 --> 00:35:02,792
(ice hockey commentary on radio)

300
00:35:09,306 --> 00:35:12,758
Derek! Derek!

301
00:35:12,894 --> 00:35:15,100
Watch the offside.

302
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:16,772
(whistle)

303
00:35:22,737 --> 00:35:25,941
- Stay on side, Youngblood.
- Pass the puck.

304
00:35:27,243 --> 00:35:31,537
- Don't tell me when to pass the puck.
- You want me to slow down for you?

305
00:35:31,664 --> 00:35:34,119
Settle this family squabble
some other time.

306
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:37,999
I got another game to work next week,
if you don't mind.

307
00:35:38,129 --> 00:35:41,214
(player) Come on, ref! Drop it!

308
00:35:46,137 --> 00:35:48,177
Here, back.

309
00:35:52,061 --> 00:35:54,979
- Come on, I'm open.
- Don't play with it. Move it.

310
00:35:55,106 --> 00:35:57,229
Now!

311
00:35:59,694 --> 00:36:02,897
- Back! I'm open!
- Take it in!

312
00:36:03,031 --> 00:36:05,902
They look like they've been
skating together for years.

313
00:36:06,034 --> 00:36:10,743
Youngblood moves into the Toronto zone.
He's really showing some speed.

314
00:36:12,666 --> 00:36:14,208
(opponent) I got him!

315
00:36:14,335 --> 00:36:16,743
He moves to his left.
He skates around them.

316
00:36:19,048 --> 00:36:20,922
He's in alone on the goalie.

317
00:36:22,927 --> 00:36:25,881
- He scores!
- Way to go, Youngblood!

318
00:36:26,014 --> 00:36:28,090
(laughter)

319
00:36:29,184 --> 00:36:30,643
Shh!

320
00:36:30,769 --> 00:36:34,602
- Who's winning?
- Mustangs.

321
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:03,000
(PA) Scoring for Hamilton,
number ten, Dean Youngblood.

322
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:06,672
Assist from number nine, Derek Sutton.

323
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:08,848
Nice move, rookie.

324
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:15,225
Rossini, take Youngblood's next shift.

325
00:38:21,805 --> 00:38:22,968
Jessie.

326
00:38:39,366 --> 00:38:41,193
Oh! Agh!

327
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:00,298
Dean?

328
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:03,135
Is there any blood?

329
00:39:03,266 --> 00:39:05,972
You son of a bitch.

330
00:39:06,103 --> 00:39:11,144
Hockey players love the sight of blood.
Especially their own.

331
00:39:18,366 --> 00:39:20,774
I scored a goal.

332
00:39:21,577 --> 00:39:24,947
Really? I don't follow hockey.

333
00:39:25,081 --> 00:39:27,121
Or hockey players.

334
00:39:31,505 --> 00:39:35,087
You know, your dad benched me.

335
00:39:35,217 --> 00:39:38,052
Derek says it's because I'm seeing you.

336
00:39:42,225 --> 00:39:44,265
Maybe he's right.

337
00:39:46,229 --> 00:39:50,143
If I'm getting benched for something
I didn't do, I might as well do it.

338
00:39:50,275 --> 00:39:53,193
- Do what?
- Take you out.

339
00:39:55,990 --> 00:40:01,660
- Why do you think I'll go out with you?
- Cos your old man doesn't want you to.

340
00:40:03,998 --> 00:40:06,536
Sounds like a pretty good reason.

341
00:40:17,346 --> 00:40:19,386
(waltz music)

342
00:40:28,274 --> 00:40:32,059
It doesn't look like a Mustangs practice,
that's for sure.

343
00:40:32,195 --> 00:40:34,651
Is this where all the young people come?

344
00:40:34,781 --> 00:40:38,648
It's either this or Slumber Party Massacre.
Come on.

345
00:40:38,785 --> 00:40:43,744
Don't worry. I'll catch you if you fall.
Just hold onto the side and you'll be fine.

346
00:40:43,874 --> 00:40:45,914
There we go.

347
00:40:48,838 --> 00:40:51,126
There you go.
Looking better.

348
00:40:51,257 --> 00:40:53,297
Good. Keep going.

349
00:40:56,346 --> 00:40:59,550
- You're real coordinated.
- I'll play for New York someday.

350
00:40:59,683 --> 00:41:03,383
I think you oughta learn how to skate first.

351
00:41:05,939 --> 00:41:08,513
You two all right?

352
00:41:08,651 --> 00:41:11,486
Yeah, we're just fine.
It's his first time.

353
00:41:11,613 --> 00:41:16,073
You better stay alongside of the boards
or you're gonna get run over.

354
00:41:16,576 --> 00:41:18,616
OK.

355
00:41:20,622 --> 00:41:22,662
Come on.

356
00:41:28,839 --> 00:41:31,674
- (Dean) So, you can skate.
- (guard) Damn kids.

357
00:41:31,801 --> 00:41:34,374
Too bad for you, cos you're it.

358
00:41:49,528 --> 00:41:51,568
Hey, lady, slow down!

359
00:41:52,824 --> 00:41:54,899
(blows whistle)

360
00:41:58,997 --> 00:42:00,159
Gotcha!

361
00:42:29,196 --> 00:42:31,236
(Murray singing)

362
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,200
In here.

363
00:42:47,048 --> 00:42:48,163
Shit.

364
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:57,049
Great voice.

365
00:42:57,185 --> 00:42:59,223
Closet crooner.

366
00:43:02,398 --> 00:43:04,936
"Mad Dog" Murray Chadwick.

367
00:43:07,904 --> 00:43:09,447
Look.

368
00:43:09,573 --> 00:43:12,194
Second row.

369
00:43:12,325 --> 00:43:15,280
I used to go to all the games.

370
00:43:15,412 --> 00:43:18,781
Right next to the penalty box
so you could be near your old man.

371
00:43:18,916 --> 00:43:20,992
He never lost a fight, did he?

372
00:43:21,127 --> 00:43:28,126
He wasn't just some goon. I was there
when he got a goal in an all-star game.

373
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:37,223
All I remember is my dad
racing up the ice with the puck,

374
00:43:37,352 --> 00:43:42,394
got up to the blue line, cut across
the middle and then blasted it on the fly.

375
00:43:43,484 --> 00:43:46,854
Upper left-hand corner.
Goalie never moved.

376
00:43:46,988 --> 00:43:50,191
I thought you didn't follow hockey.
Or hockey players.

377
00:44:06,425 --> 00:44:08,465
What?

378
00:44:12,682 --> 00:44:15,683
Dean, what happens
if you don't make the pros?

379
00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:17,850
I'll make the pros.

380
00:44:17,979 --> 00:44:20,019
What if you don't?

381
00:44:22,651 --> 00:44:26,316
Ever since I was six years old,
I've been faster than anyone.

382
00:44:26,446 --> 00:44:31,821
Even kids three and four years older
than I was, they could never catch me.

383
00:44:31,953 --> 00:44:36,117
They used to try and beat the shit
out of me instead.

384
00:44:38,085 --> 00:44:40,160
We got this big pond on our farm.

385
00:44:40,295 --> 00:44:45,835
As soon as it would freeze over, me and
my brother Kelly would put on our skates.

386
00:44:45,968 --> 00:44:48,673
We'd stay out there all day long.

387
00:44:49,931 --> 00:44:55,221
It'd be dark by the time we got home. We
had to sit by the fire to thaw out our feet.

388
00:44:55,353 --> 00:44:58,556
My mom used to think we were crazy.

389
00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:01,857
I remember never wanting to come in
when I was young.

390
00:45:01,985 --> 00:45:06,029
When you were young.
How old do you think you are?

391
00:45:06,156 --> 00:45:11,862
17. If I don't sign a pro contract
in the next couple of years, I'm through.

392
00:45:11,996 --> 00:45:18,283
It's just the way it works. And I don't
wanna work in a goddamn mill or farm.

393
00:45:23,258 --> 00:45:26,093
What does your mother
think about all this?

394
00:45:26,219 --> 00:45:32,305
She left my dad and us about four years
ago. She doesn't know what's going on.

395
00:45:32,434 --> 00:45:33,893
I'm sorry.

396
00:45:36,731 --> 00:45:39,222
I guess she got tired of the farm too.

397
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:45,563
My brother and I got used to her being
gone, but I don't think my old man has.

398
00:45:55,084 --> 00:45:57,123
- Still hurt?
- No.

399
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:07,758
Maybe I will.

400
00:46:07,889 --> 00:46:09,928
Will what?

401
00:46:11,851 --> 00:46:14,722
Start following hockey again.

402
00:46:20,403 --> 00:46:22,442
(giggling)

403
00:46:29,704 --> 00:46:32,160
- Good book?
- Great writer.

404
00:46:43,469 --> 00:46:46,423
- It's a nice room.
- It's not bad.

405
00:46:46,555 --> 00:46:48,263
(bed springs creak)

406
00:46:48,391 --> 00:46:53,349
- Bed's a little creaky.
- Tell me about it. I use it every night.

407
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:55,520
To sleep on.

408
00:46:56,483 --> 00:46:58,523
Of course.

409
00:48:32,669 --> 00:48:34,709
(kettle whistles)

410
00:48:36,507 --> 00:48:40,636
("Get Ready" by Diana Ross
and the Supremes on radio)

411
00:49:03,787 --> 00:49:06,324
(hums along to radio)

412
00:50:08,731 --> 00:50:10,973
No, no! Don't!

413
00:50:28,294 --> 00:50:30,334
(Jessie) Stop it!

414
00:50:45,396 --> 00:50:47,436
Room service?

415
00:50:55,490 --> 00:50:56,865
(bell rings)

416
00:50:57,617 --> 00:50:59,657
God, he's good.

417
00:51:02,831 --> 00:51:05,286
What about a shot of tequila?

418
00:51:06,376 --> 00:51:07,787
No way.

419
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:15,085
So, did old lady McGill catch you before
or after you put the puck in the net?

420
00:51:19,891 --> 00:51:23,675
I would have loved to have seen
the look on her face.

421
00:51:25,105 --> 00:51:27,726
I think this is yours.

422
00:51:46,044 --> 00:51:47,159
(bell rings)

423
00:51:47,295 --> 00:51:49,335
Scores!

424
00:51:51,425 --> 00:51:55,090
So, does little boom-boom
have a crush on her?

425
00:51:56,472 --> 00:52:00,256
- Who? Miss McGill?
- Fuck you.

426
00:52:03,647 --> 00:52:07,146
- I guess I do.
- She is a fox.

427
00:52:20,247 --> 00:52:22,536
How long have the stitches been in?

428
00:52:22,667 --> 00:52:24,706
A week.

429
00:52:27,964 --> 00:52:30,003
Where you going?

430
00:52:30,133 --> 00:52:32,256
I'm gonna take 'em out.

431
00:52:32,385 --> 00:52:35,090
Why?

432
00:52:35,222 --> 00:52:38,259
You don't want stitches in Thunder Bay.

433
00:52:38,392 --> 00:52:40,718
How come?

434
00:52:40,853 --> 00:52:43,557
They see 'em,
they'll try to open you up again.

435
00:52:43,689 --> 00:52:46,145
- That's nice.
- Sit down.

436
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:54,316
Don't worry. I've only had
a couple of cases of beer.

437
00:53:00,415 --> 00:53:04,710
- You sure are a glutton for punishment.
- This wasn't my idea.

438
00:53:04,837 --> 00:53:10,080
I'm talking about taking out
Chadwick's only daughter. Hold still.

439
00:53:10,217 --> 00:53:13,135
I just looked at her once
and he benched me.

440
00:53:13,263 --> 00:53:15,932
You just want someone
to pass you the puck.

441
00:53:16,558 --> 00:53:20,508
Listen, little hot dog, I don't need you
to pass me the goddamn puck.

442
00:53:20,645 --> 00:53:24,145
I made 91 goals this year
before you showed up.

443
00:53:24,274 --> 00:53:28,522
Maybe you can play for
the Tallahassee Warthogs next year, boy.

444
00:53:32,117 --> 00:53:33,859
I don't give a shit where I play,

445
00:53:33,993 --> 00:53:38,454
as long as I go number one in the draft
and I sign the biggest contract I can.

446
00:53:38,581 --> 00:53:43,493
I've been busting my ass for four years
and I'm gonna get what's coming to me.

447
00:53:43,629 --> 00:53:48,291
I figure if I'm lucky, I can make
enough money to last me for a while.

448
00:53:48,425 --> 00:53:51,047
I'm not gonna be a lawyer or a doctor.

449
00:53:51,178 --> 00:53:53,218
That's for sure.

450
00:53:54,182 --> 00:53:56,851
I didn't even get to finish high school.

451
00:53:56,977 --> 00:54:01,104
But I can play the game, and so can you.

452
00:54:03,358 --> 00:54:06,692
But it's more than just skating fast
and shooting bullets.

453
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:10,901
You gotta understand,
they got us by the balls, Deaner.

454
00:54:11,033 --> 00:54:14,734
We all wanna play so bad.

455
00:54:14,870 --> 00:54:18,869
That's all you wanna do
when you're growing up.

456
00:54:19,959 --> 00:54:24,420
Then you realise
that it's more than just a game.

457
00:54:24,547 --> 00:54:28,130
You gotta play it according to their rules.

458
00:54:34,267 --> 00:54:36,805
Do you still like playing?

459
00:54:38,729 --> 00:54:40,769
Fucking love it.

460
00:54:55,873 --> 00:55:02,374
(PA) The Hamilton Mustangs, winners
of their semifinal series against Toronto.

461
00:55:03,297 --> 00:55:06,583
Sutton. Careful out there.
You'll get your hair messed up.

462
00:55:06,718 --> 00:55:09,256
Go hump your St Bernard, scumnuts.

463
00:55:13,934 --> 00:55:17,517
(spectator) Hewitt,
learned how to skate yet?

464
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:33,538
And now, returning home,
undefeated in their series against Calgary,

465
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:37,247
our own Thunder Bay Bombers!

466
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:47,052
I'll be a son of a bitch!

- Three blind mice.
- Yeah.

469
00:56:02,361 --> 00:56:06,441
The series should be a classic,
as the slick Mustangs face the Bombers,

470
00:56:06,573 --> 00:56:08,981
the most intimidating team
in junior hockey.

471
00:56:09,118 --> 00:56:13,068
Starting line-ups for tonight's game.
For the Mustangs...

472
00:56:13,206 --> 00:56:16,576
(Murray) Sutton, Harris and Lynch. Go!

473
00:56:19,295 --> 00:56:23,341
Left wing, Lynch,
and centre, Sutton.

474
00:56:23,467 --> 00:56:26,836
For the Bombers: In goal, Lexler.

475
00:56:26,971 --> 00:56:29,806
On defence, Brown and...

476
00:56:29,933 --> 00:56:33,977
Gentlemen, it's a big series.
Play it tough and play it clean.

477
00:56:34,103 --> 00:56:36,855
(spectator) Rip their eyes out!

478
00:56:52,373 --> 00:56:56,502
What I wanna know is
why you guys aren't in the Ice Follies?

479
00:56:56,628 --> 00:56:59,913
You're my Junior A hockey team.

480
00:57:00,048 --> 00:57:04,461
I never saw such a sorry
bunch of losers in my life!

481
00:57:04,595 --> 00:57:08,593
The big mistake I made
was letting Racki go.

482
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:13,728
He and the rest of them own you tonight.

483
00:57:13,854 --> 00:57:19,976
I got three bus tickets here to some
of your favourite Junior C hockey teams.

484
00:57:20,111 --> 00:57:22,151
Blind River,

485
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:25,279
Medicine Hat

486
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:28,534
and Squaw Island.

487
00:57:29,204 --> 00:57:36,085
If you don't want one of these - and I'll do
it too - you'd better start hitting out there!

488
00:57:36,211 --> 00:57:39,248
Let 'em know
you're in the same goddamn rink!

489
00:57:39,382 --> 00:57:45,836
I didn't drive up the fucking Arctic Circle
to get my ass kicked by these goons!

490
00:57:45,973 --> 00:57:51,845
First half you could skate around
with a carton of eggs and not break any.

491
00:57:51,979 --> 00:57:54,435
You're tougher than that.
You know it, I know it.

492
00:57:54,565 --> 00:57:57,566
We're in this together.
You're a team, a family.

493
00:57:57,693 --> 00:57:59,733
You wanna win?

494
00:58:01,322 --> 00:58:03,778
Start acting like one.

495
00:58:40,572 --> 00:58:42,898
Get out there!

496
00:58:48,999 --> 00:58:49,995
Let's go!

497
00:58:57,090 --> 00:59:00,341
Do it, do it!
Take your best shot!

498
00:59:02,096 --> 00:59:03,923
Hey, Youngblood!

499
00:59:46,059 --> 00:59:48,099
(siren)

500
01:00:18,970 --> 01:00:22,588
Youngblood, take left wing
from Naz in this period.

501
01:01:16,991 --> 01:01:18,450
Son of a bitch!

502
01:01:21,245 --> 01:01:25,574
(PA) Scoring for the Hamilton Mustangs,
number nine, Derek Sutton,

503
01:01:25,708 --> 01:01:29,789
on an assist from number ten,
Dean Youngblood.

504
01:01:29,921 --> 01:01:33,207
The rookie setting up Sutton
for his 93rd tally this year.

505
01:01:39,056 --> 01:01:40,965
(player) Go get him, Racki.

506
01:01:44,687 --> 01:01:47,724
(Murray) All right, move it, Derek!

507
01:01:52,278 --> 01:01:54,318
Shit!

508
01:02:17,889 --> 01:02:21,175
- I'm gonna carve you up, Racki.
- All right, settle down.

509
01:02:21,310 --> 01:02:24,430
He ain't hurt.
Get up, Racki.

510
01:02:24,563 --> 01:02:28,146
- Are you OK?
- Let's go, Hewitt. You got five for slash.

511
01:02:28,275 --> 01:02:31,111
- All right.
- What about the spear, man?

512
01:02:31,237 --> 01:02:35,401
- He's gonna get let Racki get away with it.
- What about the spear?

513
01:02:35,533 --> 01:02:39,995
You got two chances of winning this
argument - slim and none. Get in there.

514
01:02:40,122 --> 01:02:42,161
You got ten!

515
01:02:44,209 --> 01:02:46,783
Hey, Hannah, eat this!

516
01:02:49,006 --> 01:02:52,707
That's the match!
Get the animal outta here!

517
01:02:53,260 --> 01:02:56,630
Penalty against Hamilton,
number two, Duane Hewitt.

518
01:02:56,764 --> 01:02:59,220
- Take a shower, Hewitt!
- Fuck off!

519
01:03:00,435 --> 01:03:05,975
What about Racki? What is this? A tryout
for you, Hannah? You fucking blind?

520
01:03:06,107 --> 01:03:08,978
Next player penalty, Hamilton.

521
01:03:10,237 --> 01:03:13,238
Why don't you use these?
You're missing a good game.

522
01:03:13,366 --> 01:03:15,655
Get somebody in the box. Now.

523
01:03:15,785 --> 01:03:19,284
Look, lights. Ice.

524
01:03:19,413 --> 01:03:23,281
You wanna spend the rest of the night
in the locker room, keep it up.

525
01:03:23,418 --> 01:03:25,458
A red line.

526
01:03:34,388 --> 01:03:37,259
I'm gonna get that son of a bitch.

527
01:03:51,073 --> 01:03:55,320
Scoring for Thunder Bay,
his first goal in a Bomber uniform,

528
01:03:55,453 --> 01:03:57,990
number 20, Carl Racki.

529
01:03:58,122 --> 01:04:01,123
Assist to number two, Dick Paradise.

530
01:04:01,250 --> 01:04:04,834
- Chew on this, Chadwick.
- Chew on this, asshole.

531
01:04:06,673 --> 01:04:11,086
- Sutton, come on off the bench.
- I got a regular shift.

532
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:19,765
Chadwick, what'd you feed 'em for lunch?
Chicken sandwiches?

533
01:04:32,534 --> 01:04:34,361
Derek!

534
01:04:35,579 --> 01:04:38,248
Hit him, Coach!

535
01:04:38,373 --> 01:04:42,039
That's it. Relax and enjoy the game.

536
01:04:57,686 --> 01:04:59,726
Shoot it in!

537
01:05:02,524 --> 01:05:04,897
Youngblood!

538
01:05:05,027 --> 01:05:07,483
On the board!

539
01:05:47,406 --> 01:05:49,067
I got him!

540
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:51,239
Shit!

541
01:05:58,919 --> 01:06:00,164
All right, Youngblood!

542
01:06:00,295 --> 01:06:02,502
- All right!
- All right, Dean!

543
01:06:02,631 --> 01:06:08,551
Scoring for Hamilton, number ten,
Dean Youngblood, unassisted.

544
01:06:42,548 --> 01:06:45,122
Come on.

545
01:06:45,260 --> 01:06:47,716
- Jesus Christ.
- Ambulance.

546
01:07:20,631 --> 01:07:22,422
Oh, man.

547
01:07:37,191 --> 01:07:39,230
How are you feeling?

548
01:07:41,153 --> 01:07:43,443
- Cold.
- What?

549
01:07:43,573 --> 01:07:46,277
Cold.

550
01:07:46,409 --> 01:07:52,911
They put a plate in my head.
It feels like I'm still on the ice.

551
01:07:53,041 --> 01:07:56,707
It's like a filling for a tooth.

552
01:07:58,463 --> 01:08:01,630
Like a big, big, fucking filling.

553
01:08:22,198 --> 01:08:24,653
So what happened?

554
01:08:27,995 --> 01:08:30,950
Racki blindsided you.

555
01:08:32,876 --> 01:08:36,245
Did you get that son of a bitch for me?

556
01:08:47,391 --> 01:08:49,266
Yeah, I got him.

557
01:08:51,312 --> 01:08:53,352
All right.

558
01:08:54,315 --> 01:08:56,107
Boom-boom.

559
01:09:17,298 --> 01:09:20,999
Yeah, the doc seemed to know
what he was doing.

560
01:09:21,136 --> 01:09:23,923
He sure wasn't looking too good.

561
01:09:24,056 --> 01:09:26,808
I'm not sure about brain damage.

562
01:09:26,934 --> 01:09:29,685
You can't get a CAT scan
in that rock-bottom town.

563
01:09:29,811 --> 01:09:34,189
It's a damn shame. We're not gonna
get someone to take his place.

564
01:09:34,317 --> 01:09:38,445
One more game
and we would have had it wrapped up.

565
01:10:26,539 --> 01:10:29,991
- Don't hang 'em up. Put 'em on.
- (all protest)

566
01:10:30,127 --> 01:10:33,994
You heard me. Right now.
And no pucks. Contact drill.

567
01:10:34,131 --> 01:10:36,752
Contact drill?!

568
01:10:39,220 --> 01:10:43,928
You were lucky to win. Ten minutes
and they would have turned it around.

569
01:10:44,058 --> 01:10:47,926
So let's go.
Jordy, take centre for Sutton.

570
01:10:55,279 --> 01:10:58,398
You want somebody to dress you,
Youngblood?

571
01:10:58,532 --> 01:11:01,735
Get your gear on and get on the ice.

572
01:11:01,869 --> 01:11:03,909
Why?

573
01:11:08,126 --> 01:11:10,498
Because I said so, that's why.

574
01:11:10,628 --> 01:11:13,962
You wanna practise now?

575
01:11:14,090 --> 01:11:17,923
You're not on the ice in five minutes,
you're off the team.

576
01:11:30,567 --> 01:11:33,901
And just keep walking, Youngblood.

577
01:11:34,029 --> 01:11:36,816
All the way back to the farm.

578
01:11:42,913 --> 01:11:44,953
Come on, let's go.

579
01:12:15,948 --> 01:12:17,988
God.

580
01:12:22,623 --> 01:12:25,196
I should have done something.

581
01:12:26,793 --> 01:12:28,869
There's nothing you could have done.

582
01:12:29,004 --> 01:12:31,211
I could have hit Racki before he hit Derek.

583
01:12:31,340 --> 01:12:34,425
- You mean maim Racki?
- Why not? He deserved it.

584
01:12:34,552 --> 01:12:40,139
Dammit! You're all alike!
It means that you're no better than Racki.

585
01:12:40,266 --> 01:12:44,845
- Derek wouldn't be in the hospital.
- So maybe it's Racki in the hospital.

586
01:12:44,980 --> 01:12:47,436
Or maybe it's you, Dean.

587
01:12:48,609 --> 01:12:51,360
Maybe it's you
covered with bandages and tubes.

588
01:12:51,486 --> 01:12:53,563
Maybe it should be.

589
01:12:54,448 --> 01:12:57,319
God, what are you saying?

590
01:12:57,451 --> 01:13:01,201
I watched that game
and I saw Derek lying there on the ice.

591
01:13:01,331 --> 01:13:06,289
And I watched them take him out, and all I
could think about is what if it'd been you?

592
01:13:06,419 --> 01:13:09,337
What if it was you?
Why don't you just quit?

593
01:13:09,464 --> 01:13:14,257
I did! I walked off the team today.

594
01:13:16,889 --> 01:13:21,101
For the first time in my life,
I didn't wanna play.

595
01:13:23,313 --> 01:13:25,769
Dean, it's only a game.

596
01:13:29,444 --> 01:13:31,982
It's all I ever wanted to do.

597
01:14:28,257 --> 01:14:32,671
Gee, superstar,
you really showed 'em, didn't you?

598
01:14:36,641 --> 01:14:39,642
"All I ever wanted to do was play hockey."

599
01:14:43,357 --> 01:14:47,141
"But the guys on the other team
are real mean."

600
01:14:50,406 --> 01:14:53,491
"And the coach, the coach isn't fair."

601
01:14:57,789 --> 01:15:02,001
- "And my best friend's not feeling well."
- He's half-dead, you asshole!

602
01:15:02,127 --> 01:15:07,715
I don't give a fuck if he's all the way dead.
Does that mean you are too? Huh?

603
01:15:07,842 --> 01:15:10,333
I didn't bust my nuts
doing the work of two

604
01:15:10,470 --> 01:15:15,428
so you could come back
and whine about hard-luck stories.

605
01:15:15,558 --> 01:15:17,598
Would you rather spread manure

606
01:15:17,727 --> 01:15:21,061
or play hockey for 20,000 people
at Madison Square Garden?

607
01:15:21,189 --> 01:15:23,941
- Spread manure.
- You candy ass!

608
01:15:24,067 --> 01:15:29,406
I got down on my knees. I begged them
to let me play. With one eye!

609
01:15:32,493 --> 01:15:37,404
You think Derek would have hopped a bus
home if you cracked your skull open?

610
01:15:38,207 --> 01:15:39,203
Huh?

611
01:15:39,333 --> 01:15:44,411
There's no way. If you were so concerned
about him, you should have stuck around.

612
01:15:44,548 --> 01:15:47,335
You'd have had the rest of the series
to make Racki pay.

613
01:15:47,468 --> 01:15:52,046
That'd have done Derek a lot of good.
They're gonna kick Racki out anyway.

614
01:15:52,181 --> 01:15:58,516
Wake up, superstar. This is junior hockey
now. He'll sit out one game max.

615
01:16:01,358 --> 01:16:06,185
If anything, he's strengthened
his bargaining position with the pros.

616
01:16:07,239 --> 01:16:09,278
Fuck!

617
01:16:10,117 --> 01:16:14,364
And Chadwick is a real prick, huh?
He's the best coach in the league, Dean.

618
01:16:14,497 --> 01:16:17,533
He knows what it takes to be a pro.
You need it here.

619
01:16:19,085 --> 01:16:22,584
And you never quit. Ever!

620
01:16:28,845 --> 01:16:35,014
I was only kidding when I said you'd be
back dragging your butt in two weeks.

621
01:16:35,144 --> 01:16:39,224
I'm half-ready to call 'em up,
see if they'll let me take your place.

622
01:16:51,912 --> 01:16:57,072
You wouldn't have made it anyway.
All you could do was fight.

623
01:17:31,913 --> 01:17:33,952
Shit!

624
01:17:48,556 --> 01:17:49,836
Push! Push!

625
01:17:57,649 --> 01:17:59,688
Kelly, give me a minute.

626
01:18:08,578 --> 01:18:12,705
"Mustangs ran into a Pearl Harbor of sorts
last night at the home rink,

627
01:18:12,832 --> 01:18:15,038
when they were bombed off the ice

628
01:18:15,168 --> 01:18:19,213
by the rough-and-tumble visitors
from Thunder Bay."

629
01:18:19,339 --> 01:18:22,755
"The Bombers intimidated the Mustangs
from the drop of the puck,

630
01:18:22,884 --> 01:18:26,882
as they checked them
from one end of the ice to the other."

631
01:18:27,014 --> 01:18:30,300
"Without injured star Derek Sutton
and rookie Dean Youngblood,

632
01:18:30,434 --> 01:18:33,519
they were unable to stage
an offensive threat."

633
01:18:33,646 --> 01:18:36,730
"League officials announced
the suspension of a player."

634
01:18:36,857 --> 01:18:40,025
"It was ruled the defence man
Duane Hewitt of the Mustangs

635
01:18:40,153 --> 01:18:44,981
will be disqualified
for the final game next week."

636
01:18:47,786 --> 01:18:52,199
I don't see anything
about your buddy Racki in here.

637
01:19:24,701 --> 01:19:27,655
Just hit it, pillow hands.

638
01:19:33,252 --> 01:19:36,752
Don't worry. It's not gonna hit you back.

639
01:19:42,929 --> 01:19:45,502
Get your hands up high.

640
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:47,633
Keep 'em up there.

641
01:19:50,312 --> 01:19:53,182
You're gonna lead with your left.

642
01:19:56,568 --> 01:19:59,653
Jab. Setting him up for the big right.

643
01:20:02,367 --> 01:20:05,153
Here's a combination.

644
01:20:10,875 --> 01:20:14,577
Remember, though,
get that stick away from him first.

645
01:20:18,467 --> 01:20:20,506
You fuck!

646
01:20:29,645 --> 01:20:32,101
Go ahead.
Give it a shot.

647
01:20:43,535 --> 01:20:47,035
See how easy that is?
No harder, no faster.

648
01:20:47,164 --> 01:20:49,738
Jab, cross. Jab, cross.

649
01:20:51,002 --> 01:20:53,042
Go ahead. Try.

650
01:20:58,718 --> 01:21:00,711
Come on.

651
01:21:00,846 --> 01:21:02,922
His head's up here.

652
01:21:03,057 --> 01:21:04,966
Good. Jab right.

653
01:21:05,851 --> 01:21:07,594
Come up.

654
01:21:07,728 --> 01:21:10,184
Good. Move it around.

655
01:21:12,275 --> 01:21:14,314
Finish him.

656
01:23:04,812 --> 01:23:06,639
What are you doing here?

657
01:23:06,773 --> 01:23:10,059
If you're gonna go back,
I wanna make sure you're ready.

658
01:23:10,193 --> 01:23:12,981
- I'm ready.
- Oh, yeah?

659
01:23:14,531 --> 01:23:16,358
So hit me.

660
01:23:20,412 --> 01:23:22,619
I said hit me.

661
01:23:25,543 --> 01:23:29,208
Hit me.
What are you waiting for? Come on.

662
01:23:29,338 --> 01:23:32,423
Come on. What are you waiting for?

663
01:23:43,020 --> 01:23:47,896
You can learn to punch in the barn,
but you gotta learn to survive on the ice.

664
01:23:49,611 --> 01:23:54,356
Come on. There's a couple of things
I might be able to show you.

665
01:23:54,490 --> 01:24:00,327
You gotta be able to keep your balance,
hold a guy off, maybe take a few punches.

666
01:24:00,956 --> 01:24:04,041
Come on, grab me.
Grab me. Come on.

667
01:24:04,669 --> 01:24:07,289
Come on, kid.
Show me something.

668
01:24:07,421 --> 01:24:11,371
Show me something. Come on, kid,
show me something. Come on, kid.

669
01:24:16,848 --> 01:24:20,264
Christ, he's strong for a little guy.
Come on, kid.

670
01:24:20,393 --> 01:24:23,478
Come on, kid.
Go for the jersey.

671
01:24:23,605 --> 01:24:26,143
Goddammit! Pull it!

672
01:24:40,165 --> 01:24:42,835
Why didn't you help me before?

673
01:24:44,419 --> 01:24:46,626
Huh?

674
01:24:46,755 --> 01:24:49,211
Why did you wait?

675
01:24:50,843 --> 01:24:54,129
I didn't want another son hurt.

676
01:24:58,935 --> 01:25:03,893
Sometimes us old farts aren't so smart.

677
01:25:08,195 --> 01:25:10,234
So what else you got, Pop?

678
01:25:12,074 --> 01:25:14,399
There might be a trick or two.

679
01:25:34,015 --> 01:25:40,634
(PA) Let's hear a warm welcome for the
visiting team, the Thunder Bay Bombers.

680
01:25:52,242 --> 01:25:56,454
This is the final game in the
Canadian Junior Hockey Championship,

681
01:25:56,580 --> 01:25:59,748
the memorial cup going to the winner.

682
01:26:13,473 --> 01:26:16,095
Are you gonna let me in, Fraze?

683
01:26:16,226 --> 01:26:18,682
Let me get Murray. OK?

684
01:26:23,025 --> 01:26:26,228
Scratched from tonight's roster,
the following players:

685
01:26:26,362 --> 01:26:30,941
For Thunder Bay -
number 27, Dennis Turnbull.

686
01:26:31,075 --> 01:26:35,405
And for Hamilton -
number two, Duane Hewitt,

687
01:26:35,539 --> 01:26:41,375
number nine, Derek Sutton,
and number ten, Dean Youngblood.

688
01:26:44,131 --> 01:26:46,171
What are those for?

689
01:26:50,679 --> 01:26:52,471
I wanna play tonight.

690
01:26:52,598 --> 01:26:59,017
You're a scratch, or didn't you hear?
You walked off the team. You're through.

691
01:26:59,147 --> 01:27:02,232
- You need me.
- Think it's that easy?

692
01:27:06,280 --> 01:27:09,234
If I get by you, will you let me play?

693
01:27:11,369 --> 01:27:14,536
What makes you think you can get by me?

694
01:27:24,591 --> 01:27:26,631
(Derek) Let him in, Coach.

695
01:27:31,181 --> 01:27:34,052
Go ahead. Suit up.
I might use you.

696
01:27:50,911 --> 01:27:53,581
So you decided to be a hockey player.

697
01:27:54,915 --> 01:27:57,406
Yeah. I did.

698
01:27:59,170 --> 01:28:01,626
I figured you'd show.

699
01:28:05,677 --> 01:28:07,753
You gonna watch?

700
01:28:11,934 --> 01:28:14,935
No, I've never watched a game in my life.

701
01:28:20,109 --> 01:28:25,234
Listen, just forget about Racki, man.
He's not worth it.

702
01:28:25,365 --> 01:28:28,615
Just go out there
and win that fucking game.

703
01:28:35,918 --> 01:28:37,163
OK?

704
01:29:00,945 --> 01:29:06,106
I would like to remind the audience that
the consumption of alcohol is prohibited.

705
01:29:06,242 --> 01:29:11,699
Violators will be prosecuted.
Thank you for your cooperation.

706
01:29:23,427 --> 01:29:28,339
Ladies and gentlemen, number ten
for the Mustangs, Dean Youngblood,

707
01:29:28,474 --> 01:29:32,804
formerly a scratch,
will be in the line-up tonight.

708
01:29:37,776 --> 01:29:41,774
Last game, gentlemen.
Let's make it a good one.

709
01:30:20,822 --> 01:30:25,734
It's second period, Murray.
The kid's still sitting on the fucking bench.

710
01:30:51,773 --> 01:30:55,722
Scoring for the Thunder Bay Bombers,
number 20, Carl Racki,

711
01:30:55,860 --> 01:30:59,644
with assist going to number 15.

712
01:30:59,781 --> 01:31:02,319
Why the hell doesn't he put him in?

713
01:31:04,953 --> 01:31:07,408
Youngblood, take left wing.

714
01:31:09,625 --> 01:31:12,792
Youngblood, you forgot your helmet.

715
01:31:13,879 --> 01:31:16,205
It's about time, Chadwick!

716
01:31:29,647 --> 01:31:31,685
Come on, Youngblood!

717
01:31:46,748 --> 01:31:48,491
Huh? Huh?

718
01:31:48,625 --> 01:31:52,754
Scoring for the Mustangs,
number ten, Dean Youngblood,

719
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:56,544
with an assist going to
number four, Tom McCoy.

720
01:32:02,807 --> 01:32:04,847
Patrick. I got him.

721
01:32:12,651 --> 01:32:15,023
Hey! I'm open!

722
01:32:20,868 --> 01:32:25,411
Cheap shot, cheap shot.
Hannah, open your eyes!

723
01:32:29,461 --> 01:32:32,415
(Murray) It's a cheap shot.
You miss everything.

724
01:32:32,547 --> 01:32:34,753
Why don't you use that whistle?

725
01:32:34,883 --> 01:32:38,963
It's a five-minute major.
He's bleeding all over the ice.

726
01:32:39,096 --> 01:32:41,136
(Frazier) Easy.

727
01:32:44,936 --> 01:32:47,011
- Let me see.
- (player) Fucking animal.

728
01:32:47,146 --> 01:32:49,020
I gotta get him off.

729
01:32:52,235 --> 01:32:54,560
For fuck's sake, not now.

730
01:32:57,783 --> 01:32:59,822
You'll be all right.

731
01:33:15,385 --> 01:33:19,881
The momentum has shifted back to
the Bombers, mounting another attack...

732
01:33:20,015 --> 01:33:21,889
No nerve damage.

733
01:33:22,017 --> 01:33:24,972
You get a cap, it'll look as good as new.

734
01:33:43,498 --> 01:33:47,247
One period left.
One period away from winning it all

735
01:33:47,378 --> 01:33:52,882
or losing to these hackers with their
shit-eating grins and wrestling tactics,

736
01:33:53,008 --> 01:33:57,754
from remembering something the rest of
your life or something you wanna forget.

737
01:33:57,889 --> 01:34:01,721
How would you like to wake up at 3am
with the scoreboard flashing:

738
01:34:01,852 --> 01:34:05,683
Bombers 2 - Mustangs 1?

739
01:34:05,814 --> 01:34:08,222
Think about when
you're shaking their hands.

740
01:34:08,358 --> 01:34:13,436
You wanna be able to look them
dead in the eye, not down at their skates.

741
01:34:13,573 --> 01:34:15,612
Let's play some hockey!

742
01:34:22,665 --> 01:34:24,326
Shoot it, Dean!

743
01:34:28,464 --> 01:34:30,788
Why doesn't he hit him back?

744
01:34:43,187 --> 01:34:46,224
Stick him! Stick him in the head!

745
01:34:48,735 --> 01:34:52,187
What's the matter?
Leave your balls at home, Youngblood?

746
01:34:52,323 --> 01:34:55,193
Sit down and shut up, lard ass!

747
01:35:40,207 --> 01:35:45,367
Scoring again for the Mustangs, with
only ten seconds left in regulation time,

748
01:35:45,504 --> 01:35:49,087
Dean Youngblood, unassisted.

749
01:36:00,645 --> 01:36:02,685
There's the puck!

750
01:36:11,407 --> 01:36:13,779
Call it, Hannah!

751
01:36:14,744 --> 01:36:16,784
Call it, you meat head!

752
01:36:22,962 --> 01:36:27,754
You crazy, Hannah?
There's three seconds left. Is that a call?

753
01:36:27,883 --> 01:36:32,261
Attaboy, Hannah!
Attaboy! You're beautiful!

754
01:36:32,388 --> 01:36:34,262
- What are you calling?
- Penalty shot.

755
01:36:34,391 --> 01:36:35,422
I love you.

756
01:36:35,559 --> 01:36:37,930
- For what?
- Penalty shot, Hamilton.

757
01:36:38,061 --> 01:36:41,181
- Open your goddamn eyes.
- He tripped over his legs.

758
01:36:41,314 --> 01:36:44,518
- You pulled him down from behind.
- He took a dive.

759
01:36:44,651 --> 01:36:47,190
The rest of you guys
get to your benches.

760
01:36:47,321 --> 01:36:48,898
Get outta here, Hannah.

761
01:36:49,031 --> 01:36:54,986
Penalty shot awarded to the Mustangs,
number ten, Dean Youngblood.

762
01:36:55,121 --> 01:36:57,078
Son of a bitch.

763
01:36:59,835 --> 01:37:01,411
(whistle)

764
01:37:23,193 --> 01:37:25,649
Go on, Deaner. All yours.

765
01:39:04,135 --> 01:39:10,849
Scoring at 13:57 of the final period,
with only three seconds left in the game,

766
01:39:10,975 --> 01:39:16,563
for the Mustangs,
number ten, Dean Youngblood!

767
01:39:20,736 --> 01:39:24,235
Square off.
Keep your sticks down on the ice.

768
01:39:24,364 --> 01:39:25,479
Get it down.

769
01:39:25,616 --> 01:39:28,285
Rossini, take Youngblood out.

770
01:39:29,704 --> 01:39:31,744
Hold up, Hannah.

771
01:39:37,629 --> 01:39:40,334
No guts, Murray, eh?

772
01:39:46,472 --> 01:39:49,342
- I'm not coming off.
- The game's over.

773
01:39:49,475 --> 01:39:51,384
No, it's not.

774
01:39:52,395 --> 01:39:54,851
Murray, I'm not coming off.

775
01:39:54,981 --> 01:39:57,733
(Bombers' coach) Chadwick, quit stalling.

776
01:40:00,069 --> 01:40:02,109
Watch your stick.

777
01:40:15,252 --> 01:40:17,126
I got it.

778
01:40:34,315 --> 01:40:37,316
Let's go... pretty boy.

779
01:40:38,319 --> 01:40:39,861
Let's go.

780
01:40:56,171 --> 01:40:58,627
Get his stick away, Deaner!

781
01:40:59,675 --> 01:41:01,715
Come on!

782
01:41:12,856 --> 01:41:15,644
I'm gonna shove that stick
right up your ass.

783
01:41:15,775 --> 01:41:19,690
- What stick?
- If they wanna fight, let 'em go.

784
01:41:23,367 --> 01:41:26,120
Take your best shot, Youngblood.

785
01:41:37,883 --> 01:41:39,294
All right! Yes!

786
01:41:45,391 --> 01:41:48,262
- Let's go.
- Come on, tough guy.

787
01:41:48,394 --> 01:41:50,434
Come on.

788
01:41:52,733 --> 01:41:54,274
Come on, Racki.

789
01:42:08,332 --> 01:42:09,495
Get up!

790
01:42:11,377 --> 01:42:13,037
Shit.

791
01:42:13,171 --> 01:42:15,211
Way to go, Deaner!

792
01:42:16,383 --> 01:42:19,798
- Let me at him!
- (Dean) I'm waiting, Racki.

793
01:42:22,305 --> 01:42:24,594
Come on. Yeah!

794
01:42:50,628 --> 01:42:54,128
(Hannah) It's all over, boys.
Let's go home.

795
01:43:06,186 --> 01:43:08,226
Jessie! Jessie!

796
01:44:03,497 --> 01:44:07,081
Hey, Dean. Can I have your autograph?

797
01:44:09,755 --> 01:44:11,794
Sure.

798
01:44:17,554 --> 01:44:20,176
You guys got a pen or...?

799
01:44:20,307 --> 01:44:22,431
(all mumble) No.

800
01:44:27,023 --> 01:44:29,062
I have it.

801
01:44:32,571 --> 01:44:36,070
So how many goals
did you score last year?

802
01:44:36,200 --> 01:44:39,118
- None.
- None? Why not?

803
01:44:39,245 --> 01:44:41,071
Cos I'm a goalie.

804
01:44:43,207 --> 01:44:44,998
Right.

805
01:44:45,126 --> 01:44:48,661
What about you guys?
How many goals did you score last year?

806
01:44:48,797 --> 01:44:51,549
- I scored 30.
- Yeah? What about you?

807
01:44:51,675 --> 01:44:54,046
78.

808
01:44:54,177 --> 01:44:56,633
78, huh?

809
01:44:56,763 --> 01:45:00,678
You'll be playing
for the Mustangs next year.

810
01:45:01,435 --> 01:45:05,053
- Thanks a lot.
- Thanks a lot, Mr Youngblood.

811
01:45:07,233 --> 01:45:09,309
What about me, Mr Youngblood?

812
01:45:33,803 --> 01:45:36,638
You look like shit.

813
01:45:42,313 --> 01:45:44,768
But I love you anyway.

814
01:45:54,159 --> 01:45:55,985
I'm sorry.

815
01:45:56,410 --> 01:45:58,866
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

816
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:06,544
Are you all right?
- I'll be all right.
