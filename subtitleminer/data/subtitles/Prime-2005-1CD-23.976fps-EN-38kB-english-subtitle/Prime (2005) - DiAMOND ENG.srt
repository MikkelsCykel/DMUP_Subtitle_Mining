1
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:01,870
Oh, I'm sorry.

2
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:04,413
It's so hot in here...

3
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:07,317
and I can't figure
this stupid thing out.

4
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:11,052
I signed the papers.

5
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,017
Wow.

6
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:18,453
How are you feeling?

7
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:20,729
Terrible.

8
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:24,934
Francis was there.
Obviously, he was there.

9
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:28,039
It was really hard
to see him.

10
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:31,576
And he signed so fast.

11
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:35,302
I at least pretended
to look things over one last time.

12
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,539
He sounds terrified
to me.

13
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,944
It's going to
take a while.

14
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:42,977
I mean,
nine years, Rafi.

15
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:46,184
You can't just walk away
from that kind of time.

16
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:50,589
The crazy thing is...

17
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:55,064
I'm out of this marriage,
what, five minutes...

18
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:57,900
and all of a sudden
I just...

19
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:03,740
I find myself thinking about...

20
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,673
...a baby.

21
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:10,580
Why now? And why didn't I think
about this when I was married?

22
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:12,409
Well, I mean, you know...

23
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:16,216
...on a certain level,
you knew this wasn't the right man.

24
00:04:17,056 --> 00:04:19,183
So you were protecting yourself
in that way.

25
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,851
That was a good thing.

26
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,730
Oh, Rafi,
you're coming alive again.

27
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:27,226
You know,
you just want all the things...

28
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,167
...that you had to forget
that you could have.

29
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:33,467
That's a very good place
to move into.

30
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:36,769
And the baby thing
will happen...

31
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,039
...when it's the right time.

32
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:41,878
But just focus on the "now".

33
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:44,611
For now.

34
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:55,189
<i>Hey, Dave, it's Morris...</i>

35
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:57,454
<i>Listen, I got a favor
to ask you.</i>

36
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,589
<i>I went out with this girl
the other night.</i>

37
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:03,193
<i>And she told me never to call her again.
You know how that goes.</i>

38
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:05,703
<i>So I'm gonna need you
to come with me this time.</i>

39
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:07,569
<i>Don't freak out, all right?</i>

40
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,803
<i>I don't know how to get to Bay Ridge.
I'm not sure.</i>

41
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:12,135
<i>Bye.</i>

42
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:16,838
I don't understand
why I have to be a part of this.

43
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,713
You have an incurable sickness.

44
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:20,514
It's okay, though.
I understand.

45
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:22,417
But why am I being involved?

46
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,683
- How are you being involved?
- Because I'm in the car.

47
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:27,590
I'm going to be a witness to this.
That makes me an accessory.

48
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,890
- What, like a handbag?
- Morris.

49
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:31,725
So who's it this time?

50
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:34,198
You know what? Don't...
I don't wanna know. Don't tell me.

51
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:37,259
Her father's probably in
waste management or something.

52
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:40,306
What I would like to know is
why no girl will go out with you twice.

53
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:42,933
One date, it's over.
What do you do? What do you say?

54
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,170
You know,
it's a mystery to me, too.

55
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:52,476
Are you a hermaphrodite?
Do you have hantavirus?

56
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:54,443
This is it. Come on.

57
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:56,815
All right,
just make this quick.

58
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:58,652
I gotta meet Michelle
at the movies a little later.

59
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:01,216
- Michelle? God!
- Just make it quick.

60
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:24,142
- Hi.
- What the hell are you doing here?

61
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,845
I told you I never wanted
to see you again.

62
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:29,012
I just want to talk.
Just come out here and let's talk.

63
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:30,749
I can't believe
you came to my house.

64
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:32,848
- You have no respect for women.
- I don't, I'm sorry.

65
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:35,189
You hurt my feelings,
you piece of shit.

66
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:37,627
- Okay, okay!
- I can't believe you're here.

67
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,388
Okay? Okay?

68
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:41,160
- Mikey!
- Okay, I'm gonna go.

69
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,134
Joey, come out here!

70
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:45,898
Mikey! Joey! Come out here!
Mikey? Joey?

71
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:48,166
Go! Get in the car!
Get in the car!

72
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:51,074
Go, go, go!

73
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:58,545
Oh, shit!

74
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,120
It's not funny.

75
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:18,228
- Meeting Michelle.
- Yeah.

76
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:20,836
<i>What are you going to see,
Beaches?</i>

77
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:22,238
You're the wind
beneath my wings, Mo.

78
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:24,674
Hey, did you ever know
you were my hero?

79
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:26,839
- Have fun.
- All right, man.

80
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,842
Dave.

81
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,277
Randall.

82
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:37,515
No, no,
I remember your name.

83
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:38,750
- How you doing?
- Hi.

84
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:40,725
- What's going on?
- Nothing much.

85
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:46,687
This is my friend Katherine
and this is my friend Rafi.

86
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:49,830
- Hi.
- Hi.

87
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:52,670
So what are you doing here?

88
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:55,332
- Well, I thought I'd see a movie.
- Right.

89
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:57,569
Why? Are you embarrassed
to be seen with me?

90
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,304
- What?
- It's okay. Just tell me.

91
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:01,608
- My God, this kid is funny.
- Where did you get him?

92
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:06,448
Well, he works at Travelart
and we had that client...

93
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:07,577
Hey!

94
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:08,745
Hey.

95
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,487
- Randall.
- I'm sorry.

96
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:12,888
- Hi, Michelle!
- Michelle!

97
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,984
- You have your tickets yet?
- No, we're gonna get tickets.

98
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:16,153
- Are you seeing this?
- Yeah!

99
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:17,253
- You are?
- Yeah!

100
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,456
- That's great.
- We're...

101
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:21,659
- I'll see you in there.
- Okay, good. We'll be in...

102
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:24,331
Get in the bun.

103
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:26,899
Get in the bun.

104
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:44,655
It's locked.

105
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:48,148
What?

106
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,685
The door. It won't open.

107
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,823
So, does this
happen to you a lot?

108
00:08:57,837 --> 00:08:59,634
Actually, not often enough.

109
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:04,003
So what are we gonna do?

110
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:07,443
Wait till somebody comes out.

111
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:10,842
Right.

112
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,036
- Thank you.
- Yeah!

113
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,539
So, how long
have you guys been dating?

114
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:41,512
- Couple of weeks.
- We're not dating.

115
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,947
Okay. Next question.

116
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:46,382
I mean, we only went out twice
before this.

117
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:48,977
- Do you consider that dating?
- I guess I did.

118
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,249
I'm sorry.

119
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,823
I mean, to me,
dating sounds more serious.

120
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:56,623
Like you've already been going out
for a couple of months, like...

121
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:58,061
Maybe you don't
live together...

122
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,257
...but you definitely stay over
a couple of nights a week.

123
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,324
You don't worry about
who paid for the last meal anymore.

124
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:04,801
You've seen each other pee,
you know?

125
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,394
More serious kind of stuff.

126
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:08,269
Then what do you call this?

127
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:10,833
Well, that's it.

128
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,435
There are officially
no cute boys left here.

129
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:15,275
All right.
It's so nice to get out.

130
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:18,044
- It was nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

131
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:23,217
- Dave. Very nice to see you.
- Good night.

132
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,881
Bye. Nice to meet you.

133
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:42,063
One, two, three, four.

134
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,175
Just fucking call her.

135
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,390
<i>Hello.</i>

136
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,626
<i>Hello?</i>

137
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:31,048
<i>- Hello?
- Hi. It's Dave...</i>

138
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:32,849
Bloomberg.

139
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:34,950
Did you just call me?

140
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:37,220
Yes.

141
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,520
<i>We get disconnected?</i>

142
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:41,757
No.

143
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:44,500
Did you hang up?

144
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,001
Uh-huh.

145
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,737
They say it's better
to lie sometimes...

146
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:50,435
...but I can't really do that
when I'm this nervous.

147
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:52,807
I think I need to be
in a better place.

148
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,809
I like it better this way.
I've been around enough lying to say so.

149
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:58,281
<i>You had a lot of liars
in your life, huh?</i>

150
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:00,681
- What?
- Shit.

151
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:06,556
Would you like to go out
to dinner with me tomorrow?

152
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:10,456
David, I'm making a sandwich.
Do you want one?

153
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:12,120
No, I'm fine!

154
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:14,831
<i>- Who's that?
- That's my roommates.</i>

155
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,834
So, do you want
to have dinner?

156
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:21,266
<i>- Yes.
- Yeah?</i>

157
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:24,067
I'll call you tomorrow.

158
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:26,002
Okay.

159
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:28,705
Okay.

160
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:31,947
<i>- Bye.
- Bye.</i>

161
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:40,481
Okay, Grandma.

162
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:44,657
So, what kind of sandwich
are we talking about?

163
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:01,178
Hi, I'm here to see Rafi Gardet.
My name's Dave.

164
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:10,821
Raphael, it's Damien.

165
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:13,486
Yeah. There's a...

166
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:14,852
It's Dave.

167
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:16,758
Dave here to see you.

168
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,525
Okay.

169
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:23,525
She'll be right down.

170
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:38,507
Bubbles here, I like that.

171
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,718
It's a good touch.

172
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:48,382
Is that wool?
Looks itchy. Is it itchy?

173
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,589
I think it's the biggest
contradiction in the world.

174
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:20,716
Jews eat carp, okay?

175
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:23,125
Who eats carp?
They don't serve it in restaurants.

176
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:25,288
Have you ever seen carp
on a menu in your life?

177
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,264
Please, answer me honestly.

178
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,127
- No.
- No. You know why?

179
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:32,097
Because it's disgusting.

180
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:33,703
But for all this terrible food...

181
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:36,206
...you've never seen a people
so obsessed with it in your life.

182
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:38,505
It's a remnant.
I'll bet every immigrant group...

183
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:41,671
...that was displaced by World War II
puts a lot of emphasis on food.

184
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:43,112
I mean, it was scarce.

185
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:46,481
Carp is cheap, right?
It was probably a staple of their diet.

186
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:49,487
What is this, the History Channel?
You trying to kill this for me?

187
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,149
Come on.
Sorry. Fine, go ahead.

188
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:54,689
Okay, so my friend Morris...

189
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:12,105
So I think you're gonna love this place.
It's beautiful.

190
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:13,542
No one's ever there.

191
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:15,910
- Can I see some ID?
- Sure.

192
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:19,147
- Love when that happens.
- Yeah.

193
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,048
I wish I still got carded.

194
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,221
- Excuse me, Dave.
- Yes.

195
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:28,624
Quick question for you.
How old are you?

196
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:32,057
Actually, I don't speak Vietnamese.
Why do you ask?

197
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:34,759
- Are you being evasive?
- I am trying.

198
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,498
You know,
I don't tell my age.

199
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:39,969
I think people get way
too caught up with the number.

200
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,768
I'm 37.
Did you know that?

201
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:43,573
You know, I hadn't really
thought about it.

202
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:44,734
Sure you hadn't.

203
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:46,505
Look, I know you're a lot
younger than me.

204
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:49,046
I'd just like to know,
you know, how much.

205
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:51,449
Okay, let me guess.

206
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:55,184
- Twenty-nine.
- No.

207
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:57,789
Really? Older?

208
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,785
- You don't look 30 to me.
- Thanks.

209
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:04,359
I'm 23.

210
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:05,860
No, you're not.

211
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:09,090
I don't believe you.
Let me see the license.

212
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:17,668
Oh, my God. You're a child.

213
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:20,737
Taxi!
I have T-shirts older than you.

214
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,714
- They let me drive, okay?
- Yeah, with a parent in the car.

215
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:26,046
How come you seem
so much older to me?

216
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,913
I don't know.
I don't know if I can do this.

217
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,718
Come on.

218
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,354
- Can you hold this?
- Sure.

219
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:47,865
- Are we gonna get in trouble?
- I hope so.

220
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:08,625
This place is amazing.

221
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:12,388
I can't believe
I've walked by this for 15 years...

222
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:14,364
...and I didn't know it was here.

223
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:34,380
Let's have it.

224
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:36,380
What?

225
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,621
How did you know?

226
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,955
Okay. His name is David...

227
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:46,395
...and he's really, really nice.

228
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:48,126
I mean, sweet.

229
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,328
And I met him a few days ago
and he asked me out on a date.

230
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:54,304
And we went out to dinner...

231
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:57,070
...and we kissed.

232
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:58,675
I like beer.

233
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:02,946
- Good.
- I mean, no, I...

234
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:06,776
...I never used to. I had to learn,
'cause nobody in my family drinks.

235
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:09,377
You're lucky, 'cause everyone
in my family drinks.

236
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:11,923
No, I mean, my family,
they don't drink anything.

237
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,617
It's like Salt Lake City.

238
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:17,458
They'll have maybe a sip of wine
every Friday night, on the Sabbath.

239
00:18:18,063 --> 00:18:20,293
That's it, though,
and it's Manischewitz.

240
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:21,696
I've never had that.

241
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,064
You like High-C?

242
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:25,467
'Cause my mom,
she likes to keep the wine in the fridge...

243
00:18:25,537 --> 00:18:28,005
...and we'll still be drinking it
three months later.

244
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:30,974
- A good chardonnay can last...
- Yeah. It's red.

245
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:32,741
That's not good.

246
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:35,708
- Hey, by the way. Things to avoid.
- Okay.

247
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:38,112
Beginning sentences with,
"My mom. "

248
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:40,678
Right.

249
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:42,952
I'm all over it.

250
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:52,421
However old you are,
I have to say...

251
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:56,734
...I haven't had this much fun
in a really long time.

252
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:00,600
I'm glad I met you.

253
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:03,198
I gotta tell you...

254
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:06,676
...you're making me nervous in a way
I'm not really familiar with.

255
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:31,668
My God, Lisa, what am I doing?
I only got divorced last week.

256
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:34,068
Easy, easy. It's okay.

257
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:37,404
<i>You didn't tattoo his name
on your toochis, did you?</i>

258
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:42,136
Do you want
to save some of that for later?

259
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:48,048
What? What is it?

260
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:51,217
He's...

261
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:56,959
- ... he's only 27.
- And?

262
00:19:57,563 --> 00:20:00,794
What do you mean, "and"?
I mean, that's 10 years different.

263
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:02,695
He could be my brother.

264
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:05,430
If he were one year younger,
he could be your brother.

265
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:07,233
Aren't you embarrassed for me?
I mean...

266
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:11,003
...this just smells of
"pool boy at Sandals Resort. "

267
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,710
Oh, it's fine.
It might even do you some good...

268
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:19,307
...if you know what I mean.

269
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,352
- Lisa!
- What?

270
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:26,115
There's nothing to be ashamed of.
You're both at your sexual peak.

271
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:30,992
- So you approve?
- Yes!

272
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,861
Unequivocally.
Yes, this is good.

273
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:38,267
But it can't really go anywhere.
You know, I mean, he's...

274
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:40,199
...he's so young.

275
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:42,672
Yeah, but it's a little early
to be worrying about that.

276
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:46,370
And besides, you're not looking
to get married next week, right?

277
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:49,810
Enjoy your life a little bit.

278
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:52,047
You deserve this.

279
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:57,478
Twenty-seven.
Hell, I deserve this!

280
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:02,156
No, she's not Jewish.

281
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,721
Mom, I'm not trying to kill you.

282
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,993
Yes, I want you to be alive
to see your grandchildren.

283
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:13,394
Your Jewish grandchildren,
Mom.

284
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:17,367
No, I didn't know that you wanted
to be buried in Israel.

285
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:21,137
Mom, I'm not gonna talk about this
over the phone right now, okay?

286
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:22,805
I'll see you tomorrow.

287
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,341
I love you, too. Bye.

288
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:49,802
- Hey, Dave.
- Hi, D.

289
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,274
Where's Mom?

290
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:53,777
I told you
to hang it up, Dinah!

291
00:21:57,015 --> 00:21:58,482
Hey, guys.

292
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,381
You left the bathroom light on
this morning.

293
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:03,114
Jeff Rosenberg's son
got engaged yesterday.

294
00:22:03,355 --> 00:22:05,152
To a speech therapist.

295
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,528
<i>- Hey, boychik.
- Hi, Dad.</i>

296
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,829
We have to talk about
our last phone conversation.

297
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:24,501
Mom.
It's good to see you, too.

298
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:26,703
- I'm not kidding around.
- Okay, I can...

299
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:28,575
...can just tell
that this is gonna be...

300
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:30,638
...some sort of disciplinary action,
not a talk.

301
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:33,276
All right. We'll be sure
to make it a talk, then.

302
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,718
Now can you help your sister
set the table, please?

303
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:36,879
Sure.

304
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:39,116
And take the wine
out of the fridge.

305
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:43,620
- Has he called yet?
- The next night.

306
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:46,255
- Nice.
- I know. I'm not used to this.

307
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,761
Did you guys make a plan
to go out again?

308
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:50,392
He wanted to have dinner
with me tomorrow night.

309
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:52,061
But I have a flight
early Sunday morning.

310
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:54,071
When I told him
I had to go to Paris, he goes...

311
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:55,629
..."that's a bit drastic
for a bad date.

312
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,538
"Do you really need
to leave the country?"

313
00:22:57,609 --> 00:23:00,100
- This kid's funny.
- Please don't use that word.

314
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:02,373
Right, sorry.
He's humorous.

315
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:11,846
- What are you doing?
- Drinking.

316
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:14,118
- He's having Scotch.
- Mom, I'm 23. It's fine.

317
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:15,853
What, what, what?

318
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:19,590
<i>Tomorrow, gonna go to shul,
gonna pray that everybody...</i>

319
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:20,858
...is gonna have a happy...

320
00:23:20,932 --> 00:23:22,991
Dinah, you know,
since you told me about computers...

321
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,866
- Mom, let him finish.
- He's finished.

322
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:28,033
I've become so...

323
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:29,471
Then why do you
have to do this?

324
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:32,704
There are so many other women
that you could go out with.

325
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:36,003
And I've encouraged you
to branch out...

326
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,208
...in any other way
that you like, but just not this.

327
00:23:38,283 --> 00:23:39,750
Why do you have to do this?

328
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:41,183
What do you mean,
"do this"?

329
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,915
Do what?
Incur the wrath of God?

330
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:45,980
Why are you getting yourself
into trouble?

331
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:49,959
I'm not getting married, Mom.
I'm just seeing what's out there.

332
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:53,058
You make it out like we live
in the Warsaw ghetto.

333
00:23:53,131 --> 00:23:56,191
It's the Upper West Side.
We're strong in numbers here.

334
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,634
So you're still planning on
marrying someone Jewish?

335
00:23:58,703 --> 00:24:00,728
Yes. Sure. Okay?

336
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:05,304
But then I don't understand
why you need to go down this road.

337
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:07,311
You may end up
getting hurt for nothing.

338
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:09,370
Or worse, hurting her.

339
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:13,207
Don't you value
your culture and your history?

340
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,253
Well, it's not one
or the other, Mom.

341
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,981
But if you're
smart enough to know...

342
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:19,751
...that it makes sense to marry
someone from the same background...

343
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:21,656
...and it does, any of the studies
will show you that...

344
00:24:21,726 --> 00:24:23,193
...as far as
the divorce rates go.

345
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:25,058
Then you should be
smart enough to know...

346
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,098
...not to start something
where nothing can come of it.

347
00:24:27,165 --> 00:24:29,190
You're only going
to make a mess.

348
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:31,198
I can't even believe
what you're saying.

349
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:32,861
Do you hear
what you're saying?

350
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:34,633
- What?
- You're a therapist.

351
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:36,502
You would never tell that
to a patient.

352
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:38,008
Not true, not true.

353
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:40,237
I encourage my patients
to have relationships...

354
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:43,645
within their respective faiths.
It's easier.

355
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:48,116
I encourage them to go to mosque
or church or whatever.

356
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:53,389
I think religion is...

357
00:24:56,461 --> 00:24:58,361
...paramount in a person's life.

358
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:02,123
Okay, well, yes...

359
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:06,196
...but encouraging them
is different from discouraging them.

360
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,670
And I know that
you draw the line there.

361
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,970
Would you tell one of your patients
not to date someone...

362
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:12,566
...that they don't think
they're gonna marry...

363
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:14,771
Oh, quit asking me
what I tell my patients.

364
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,541
They're not my children.

365
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:20,107
How old is she?

366
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,551
- She's 27.
- What?

367
00:25:24,222 --> 00:25:27,487
She's four years older than you?
Oh, David.

368
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:30,624
Drop it now.
It's only going to end badly.

369
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:32,523
Maybe if you met her,
you might think...

370
00:25:32,597 --> 00:25:34,394
I'm not going to meet her.
Oh, my God.

371
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:35,592
Are you out of your mind?

372
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:37,066
Mom, do you...

373
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,234
You sound like
an after school special.

374
00:25:39,304 --> 00:25:40,601
Don't do this.

375
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:42,667
I'm doing it.

376
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:45,540
On your own then.

377
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:02,182
Hey, what's up, man?

378
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,021
Cool.

379
00:26:06,631 --> 00:26:09,156
Do you need anything or...
No?

380
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:12,993
- Go on up. She's expecting you.
- Thank you. Give me...

381
00:26:13,471 --> 00:26:15,405
Five? Thumbs up?

382
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:17,603
Smile? No?

383
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:19,608
We'll get there.

384
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:28,509
- Hi.
- Hi.

385
00:26:31,222 --> 00:26:32,416
Come on in.

386
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:40,097
- Thanks for the soup.
- Yeah.

387
00:26:40,165 --> 00:26:42,099
- It's chicken noodle.
- It's hot.

388
00:26:44,202 --> 00:26:45,294
Wow.

389
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:47,702
This place is huge.

390
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:50,167
I'm not even going to ask
what you pay.

391
00:26:50,241 --> 00:26:52,641
I don't want to know.
It's Rothko.

392
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:56,105
I've never seen this one before.
What year is this?

393
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:57,614
1954.

394
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:01,380
It's probably my single
favorite piece of art.

395
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,750
Yeah, I love how he never titled
any of his work.

396
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:09,125
It's beautiful. Luminous.

397
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:17,662
What is this?

398
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:19,968
<i>Sentimental Mood.</i>

399
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:26,042
- You never heard Coltrane before?
- No.

400
00:27:26,945 --> 00:27:29,345
- What, am I in trouble now?
- No!

401
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:31,346
No, it's just...

402
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:34,412
...he's a pretty famous
jazz musician.

403
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:39,656
Oh. So, is this that Negro music
that everybody's talking about?

404
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:41,316
'Cause I had no idea.

405
00:27:57,409 --> 00:27:59,502
I have to wake up
in five hours.

406
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:02,069
Do you want me to go?

407
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:06,008
Take off your sweater.

408
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:09,810
Wait.
Does this involve dancing?

409
00:28:09,888 --> 00:28:11,788
'Cause my corns,
they've been killing me and...

410
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,915
Take it off.
It's coming with me.

411
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:17,324
All right.

412
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:29,831
I really like her.

413
00:28:29,908 --> 00:28:32,069
She's only been gone two days,
she comes back tomorrow.

414
00:28:32,143 --> 00:28:34,543
I miss her already.
I never felt this before.

415
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:36,273
It's just 'cause
you haven't slept with her yet.

416
00:28:36,347 --> 00:28:38,144
No, that's definitely not it.

417
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:40,946
I really like her, man.
I don't know, I mean...

418
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:44,181
- ... I think I could love her.
- What?

419
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:46,519
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

420
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,251
Wait, what was I saying?

421
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:53,297
I don't know, man.
There is something about this girl...

422
00:28:53,364 --> 00:28:55,025
...ILike, you know that feeling
that you get...

423
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,658
...when you're in a room
with someone...

424
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,293
...and even though
you may not know them...

425
00:28:58,369 --> 00:28:59,563
...or understand them
completely.

426
00:28:59,637 --> 00:29:03,129
You just know that you're in
the presence of greatness?

427
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:05,774
- You know?
- Like when you come to my apartment.

428
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:07,744
And she old, man,
she a time-fighter.

429
00:29:07,812 --> 00:29:09,302
She's so fine, bro.

430
00:29:10,014 --> 00:29:11,038
I don't know.

431
00:29:11,116 --> 00:29:12,947
I just feel like it's gonna end badly,
I do.

432
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:14,882
- You sound like my mother.
- Yeah.

433
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:17,820
- Hey, Morris!
- All right!

434
00:29:19,724 --> 00:29:21,817
What the hell
am I listening to you for?

435
00:29:21,893 --> 00:29:23,827
I'm in a bakery
shopping for a pie...

436
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:25,385
...so you can put it
in some girl's face...

437
00:29:25,463 --> 00:29:27,158
...who wouldn't let you
get down her pants.

438
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:28,699
- When was the cream pie made?
- Today.

439
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:29,756
- Today?
- Yeah.

440
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:31,927
- Nice. I'll take that one.
- Awesome.

441
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:35,562
So what's with Dave?

442
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:38,366
Is he really serious
about this girl, or what?

443
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:39,569
I don't know.

444
00:29:39,644 --> 00:29:41,373
So what is she?
Catholic? Episcopalian?

445
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:42,913
I didn't ask.

446
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:45,345
Would you prefer
one denomination over another...

447
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:47,509
...as far as
the love of Christ goes?

448
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,422
- Your father's gonna flip.
- Yeah!

449
00:29:51,756 --> 00:29:54,247
And it's too bad
your mom isn't around for this.

450
00:29:54,325 --> 00:29:57,385
It would have gone over
real big with her, too.

451
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,789
So, what are we gonna do?

452
00:30:03,768 --> 00:30:05,258
I don't know.

453
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:26,582
<i>Have you ever had ikura
with quail egg?</i>

454
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,489
No. What is that?

455
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:30,893
I swear it's like having sex.

456
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:34,154
- That's a bold claim.
- You want to try it?

457
00:30:34,732 --> 00:30:36,461
How am I gonna say no now?

458
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:45,399
- That's amazing.
- I know.

459
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:48,905
What?

460
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:01,116
So, how was your trip?

461
00:31:01,392 --> 00:31:03,485
- Who cares?
- Okay.

462
00:31:39,697 --> 00:31:42,029
Well, this sounds really good.

463
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:44,799
That's what I'm hearing.

464
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,828
It was amazing.

465
00:31:47,105 --> 00:31:49,835
He's really very sweet.

466
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:54,801
I didn't have an orgasm,
though.

467
00:31:55,146 --> 00:31:56,545
Completely normal.

468
00:31:57,582 --> 00:32:00,073
There are
so many trust issues there.

469
00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:01,914
You just have to
give it time.

470
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:04,079
I'm willing to do the work.

471
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:05,588
God damn it.

472
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:10,017
Do you still worry
about his age?

473
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:11,322
Definitely.

474
00:32:11,396 --> 00:32:13,990
I mean, I was thinking last night,
there are some countries...

475
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:16,863
...where I could get
arrested for this. I mean, 23?

476
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:19,833
I thought you said he was 27.

477
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:22,333
Did I?

478
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:25,068
I did.

479
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:27,842
I'm sorry.

480
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,043
I lied to you about that.

481
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:32,878
Why do you think you lied?

482
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,179
I was...

483
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,716
I mean,
I am embarrassed by his age.

484
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,653
I mean, he's just so young.

485
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:42,057
What does he do?

486
00:32:42,493 --> 00:32:43,790
He's an artist.

487
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,054
I'm not an artist.

488
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:46,562
I thought you said
you were a painter.

489
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,895
No. I said I like to paint.

490
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:52,459
But it's a hobby.
I mean, you have to work, too.

491
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:55,705
He doesn't call himself that,
but that's what he is.

492
00:32:56,574 --> 00:32:58,701
He has some issue with it.

493
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:02,744
His family doesn't support him
in his work at all.

494
00:33:07,051 --> 00:33:08,518
Where does he live?

495
00:33:08,886 --> 00:33:11,480
Grand Street.
Lower East Side.

496
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:12,784
<i>I haven't been there yet.</i>

497
00:33:12,857 --> 00:33:15,826
<i>He has roommates,
and so I'm not exactly running over.</i>

498
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:21,591
Okay.

499
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,033
Our time is up.

500
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:26,866
And I will see you on...

501
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:29,837
...on Monday.

502
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,339
Of course.

503
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:34,172
Are you okay?

504
00:33:34,712 --> 00:33:36,577
Yes. No!

505
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:40,310
Yes. I mean, I'm fine
because I have to be somewhere.

506
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:43,517
Okay. Bye.
Bye.

507
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:55,127
Shit, shit, shit...

508
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:59,295
<i>shit, shit, shit, shit.</i>

509
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:26,491
Oh, shit.

510
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:30,259
So what the hell am I supposed
to do now, end treatment?

511
00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:32,000
Keep going?

512
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:35,498
Bring them in
for a couples session?

513
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:38,568
Well, if this doesn't
go anywhere...

514
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:41,077
And I really
don't think it will.

515
00:34:41,345 --> 00:34:44,075
Then you'll be relieved
you stayed with her now.

516
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:46,215
If you end her treatment...

517
00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:48,980
and they break up
after two weeks...

518
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:51,712
...you will not have
served her best interests.

519
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:55,884
So what are you saying?
That I should keep treating her?

520
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,723
If you think
it's just a fling, yes.

521
00:34:57,795 --> 00:35:00,992
But that sounds crazy.
Is that even ethical?

522
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,294
Your job is to help her.

523
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:06,135
That's your ethical boundary.

524
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,234
Okay.

525
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:15,869
Forgetting all the professional
implications of the moment...

526
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:18,037
...how are you feeling?

527
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:22,418
I'm a wreck.

528
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:25,916
I'm a wreck.

529
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:30,854
Rita, she's not even Jewish.

530
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:35,162
If she were Jewish...

531
00:35:35,566 --> 00:35:40,026
...would you feel better about
him dating a 37-year-old divorcée?

532
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,375
Where are we going?

533
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:53,141
I just gotta stop by work
for a second.

534
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:55,412
- What's up, Gil?
- Hey, what's up, Dave?

535
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:56,885
How you doing, man?
All right.

536
00:35:56,954 --> 00:35:58,615
- Did you set it up?
- Oh, yeah.

537
00:35:58,689 --> 00:35:59,747
- This is Rafi.
- Hi.

538
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:00,950
- Pleasure.
- Gil.

539
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,999
Oh, my God. This is amazing.

540
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,703
Come here.
Something else I want to show you.

541
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:32,018
You've gotta be kidding me.

542
00:37:27,645 --> 00:37:29,169
Go, go, go!

543
00:37:30,147 --> 00:37:31,876
Quit ignoring me!

544
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:33,940
Come on, Dave, I'm open.

545
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:37,952
Get it in there!

546
00:37:49,867 --> 00:37:52,358
Foul, man! Foul!
Stay off me. Stay off me.

547
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:54,404
I've told you twice now.
You've been warned.

548
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:08,374
Hi.

549
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:27,500
It's incredible.
It's amazing.

550
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:31,575
I'm sorry, your bra is showing.
Is it missing a button there?

551
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:34,944
No, no!
That's the way it is.

552
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,680
You were so right
about Jewish men.

553
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:40,574
I mean, so attentive.

554
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:43,784
But, I mean, of course you know.
You're married to one.

555
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:45,913
Yes, but he has ADD.

556
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:48,456
I just can't get over it.
I mean...

557
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,860
...I feel a little awkward
telling you this.

558
00:38:53,064 --> 00:38:55,589
But I can't tell anyone else.
This is so...

559
00:38:56,434 --> 00:39:01,201
We have had sex
on every surface of my apartment.

560
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,403
I mean,
I haven't had much sleep.

561
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:07,342
But he's just so eager
to please me...

562
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:09,709
...and I feel the same way
about him.

563
00:39:10,581 --> 00:39:12,606
He makes me
want to do things.

564
00:39:12,883 --> 00:39:15,408
I understand.
... that I've never...

565
00:39:15,753 --> 00:39:17,880
- ... wanted to do before.
- I got it.

566
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:20,552
You're gonna laugh...

567
00:39:20,624 --> 00:39:23,593
...but he didn't actually know
where the clitoris was.

568
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:25,786
Really?

569
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:30,629
- Did you show him?
- Of course.

570
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:32,862
I mean,
he's so uninhibited.

571
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:34,967
Just happy to learn.

572
00:39:35,272 --> 00:39:38,173
He hasn't had much experience.
He's only been with two other women.

573
00:39:38,242 --> 00:39:40,733
What? He's had sex with
two other women?

574
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:43,006
Yes.
Can you believe that's it?

575
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:46,243
Now I know why men go after
younger women.

576
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:48,379
There's something to it.

577
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:51,520
His youth, his body...

578
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:53,716
...his naiveté...

579
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:56,851
...his goddamn eagerness.
I mean...

580
00:39:58,529 --> 00:39:59,860
Isn't this great?

581
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:02,194
Yeah. It's amazing.

582
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:04,328
Listen.

583
00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:09,465
I just have to say this because
I'm too embarrassed to tell anyone else.

584
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,373
His penis...

585
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:15,974
...is so beautiful, I just...

586
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:18,673
...want to knit it a hat.

587
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:24,318
Did you ever think...

588
00:40:25,456 --> 00:40:27,356
...that I would be
this satisfied?

589
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:30,283
I mean, sexually.

590
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:32,456
Not like this.

591
00:40:34,231 --> 00:40:36,062
Are you using protection?

592
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:39,300
Oh, of course.
He brought it up. He's very responsible.

593
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:41,065
Oh, that's very good.

594
00:40:41,138 --> 00:40:43,129
- Is he neat?
- What?

595
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:46,766
Does he pick up after himself?
Does he make the bed in the morning?

596
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:49,074
Does he ask
before he uses the phone?

597
00:40:49,513 --> 00:40:51,174
Yes. Why?

598
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:56,080
Well, you can tell a lot
about a man from those things.

599
00:40:57,688 --> 00:40:58,814
Yeah, he's very neat.

600
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:00,982
I mean, he does have
some unusual habits, though.

601
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:03,584
Hey, I'm not trying
to freak you out here...

602
00:41:03,694 --> 00:41:05,889
...but these Q-Tips are amazing.

603
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:10,365
Guess what? You're freaking me out.
What are you talking about?

604
00:41:10,835 --> 00:41:12,496
We never had these growing up.

605
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:15,630
I saw them in my Mom's bathroom,
but we never used them.

606
00:41:19,009 --> 00:41:20,408
How'd you clean your ears?

607
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:24,005
Didn't.
Just towel-dried them, I guess.

608
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:27,407
- Let me see the Q-Tip.
- No.

609
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:30,616
Just get out of here.

610
00:41:32,723 --> 00:41:36,489
What kind of mother doesn't teach
their child how to clean their ears?

611
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:37,992
Pediatricians say...

612
00:41:38,062 --> 00:41:40,394
...that it is unhealthy
for children to use them...

613
00:41:40,464 --> 00:41:42,329
...because it can damage
the eardrum.

614
00:41:42,399 --> 00:41:45,232
And it has been shown
that a small amount of wax...

615
00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:48,100
...in the inner canal
helps protect against larger debris.

616
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:53,572
- I didn't know that.
- Well...

617
00:41:54,645 --> 00:41:55,805
Sorry.

618
00:42:00,885 --> 00:42:02,045
I'm sorry.

619
00:42:04,154 --> 00:42:05,553
Tell me what...

620
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:08,185
...what it is
that you're trying to say.

621
00:42:10,427 --> 00:42:13,123
I'm just worried about
where this is going.

622
00:42:14,265 --> 00:42:17,701
You know, I want to give
all of myself. Just let it go.

623
00:42:17,768 --> 00:42:19,099
It's so tempting.

624
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:21,435
I mean,
it's all he wants from me.

625
00:42:21,505 --> 00:42:25,441
Who wouldn't want all of you, Rafi?
You are an amazing woman.

626
00:42:25,776 --> 00:42:27,266
But then I think...

627
00:42:27,411 --> 00:42:31,347
...I mean, he's just too young
to handle the responsibility.

628
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:35,014
I'm scared
to put myself out like that.

629
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:39,556
That's a very mature
line of thought.

630
00:42:40,925 --> 00:42:43,587
I'm sure
his intentions are pure...

631
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:47,091
...but he doesn't sound like...

632
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:50,756
...he knows exactly what it is
he's getting into.

633
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:56,066
Do you think I should
just cut it off right now?

634
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:03,741
I'm not going to answer that.

635
00:43:08,285 --> 00:43:09,877
Look,
I don't want you to get...

636
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:11,888
...the wrong idea
about my family.

637
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:15,424
Sensitive subject?

638
00:43:17,528 --> 00:43:18,688
Maybe.

639
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:20,961
All right, look.

640
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:25,067
I've been having trouble
with my mom concerning you.

641
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:27,163
- Concerning me?
- Yeah.

642
00:43:28,005 --> 00:43:32,032
It's just... I wanted her
to meet you and she said no.

643
00:43:32,977 --> 00:43:35,138
That's sweet,
but don't you think...

644
00:43:35,212 --> 00:43:38,272
...it's a little early to be
introducing me to your mother?

645
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:47,716
- She said no? Why?
- I...

646
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:52,357
Look, she has a problem
with you not being Jewish.

647
00:43:53,497 --> 00:43:55,362
- She won't meet me?
- No.

648
00:43:55,432 --> 00:43:58,424
Why do you think I'm so upset?
We're not even speaking right now.

649
00:43:58,502 --> 00:44:01,266
Well, I don't understand.
I thought you said she was a therapist.

650
00:44:01,338 --> 00:44:03,533
I know.
How do you think I feel?

651
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:06,406
Didn't she meet
the black girl you dated?

652
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:07,637
No way.

653
00:44:07,711 --> 00:44:09,474
No, my mother
doesn't even know about that.

654
00:44:09,546 --> 00:44:11,480
<i>That was my bubi.
My dad's mom.</i>

655
00:44:15,953 --> 00:44:18,285
<i>- David, love.
- Hey, bubi.</i>

656
00:44:18,856 --> 00:44:21,347
I wanted you to meet
my girlfriend, Radjina.

657
00:44:21,425 --> 00:44:23,154
<i>Radjina, this is my bubi.</i>

658
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:24,958
Hi.

659
00:44:34,204 --> 00:44:35,535
Is she black?

660
00:44:40,477 --> 00:44:42,502
It's really not that funny,
okay?

661
00:44:42,946 --> 00:44:44,880
<i>My bubi died
three weeks later.</i>

662
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:47,150
And I know she didn't tell
anybody about Radjina...

663
00:44:47,217 --> 00:44:48,946
...but her reaction
and her subsequent death...

664
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:51,317
...let me know it might be
a good idea to keep that one quiet.

665
00:44:51,388 --> 00:44:53,481
I swear, I think she went
in the house after that...

666
00:44:53,557 --> 00:44:55,718
...and just hit herself
over the head with the frying pan.

667
00:44:55,793 --> 00:44:58,284
I mean, that's the image I get
whenever I'm doing something wrong.

668
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:01,263
Just her, like, whacking away
with the skillet.

669
00:45:03,834 --> 00:45:05,563
<i>I can say this much.</i>

670
00:45:06,103 --> 00:45:07,536
Age aside...

671
00:45:08,472 --> 00:45:11,532
...he gives me more
of what I really need...

672
00:45:11,608 --> 00:45:13,906
...than anyone else ever has.

673
00:45:15,979 --> 00:45:17,378
Real things.

674
00:45:18,248 --> 00:45:19,681
Things I never got.

675
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:23,019
It makes it hard
to harp on age...

676
00:45:23,087 --> 00:45:25,385
...or religion or anything,
because...

677
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:30,717
...I'm just happy.

678
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:36,691
Yeah.

679
00:45:50,214 --> 00:45:51,704
What's wrong, David?

680
00:45:52,483 --> 00:45:54,815
- I lost my job.
- I'm sorry.

681
00:45:55,285 --> 00:45:58,152
Did you hear Josh Friedman
got engaged to a chef?

682
00:45:58,222 --> 00:46:01,453
Yes, I heard.
Truffle matzo balls. Amazing.

683
00:46:02,459 --> 00:46:04,290
You better tell him
about the Kushners, Sam.

684
00:46:04,361 --> 00:46:07,728
We're trading apartments
with the Kushners, starting August 1st.

685
00:46:07,798 --> 00:46:09,060
In Miami?

686
00:46:09,466 --> 00:46:12,264
You have to find someplace else
to live while we're gone.

687
00:46:12,336 --> 00:46:15,305
Oh, come on. Not now.
This is the worst possible time.

688
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:17,732
And who goes
to Miami in August?

689
00:46:17,808 --> 00:46:18,968
That's what I said.

690
00:46:19,042 --> 00:46:20,304
Come on.
What are you talking about?

691
00:46:20,377 --> 00:46:21,776
It's beautiful
this time of year.

692
00:46:21,845 --> 00:46:25,747
Grandpa, it's a sauna down there
and it rains every single afternoon.

693
00:46:25,816 --> 00:46:27,750
The Kushners are taking you
for a ride.

694
00:46:27,818 --> 00:46:29,877
- I told you, Sam.
- Oh, what does he know?

695
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:31,944
It's a condominium.
We're going.

696
00:46:32,022 --> 00:46:34,752
What?
Condominium means no rain?

697
00:46:54,011 --> 00:46:56,172
Do you know
where Raphael Gardet is?

698
00:46:58,515 --> 00:47:00,813
My dad's got this great place
in Wainscott.

699
00:47:00,884 --> 00:47:04,183
There's a limo waiting,
so you won't have to take the Jitney.

700
00:47:04,888 --> 00:47:07,516
Excuse me.
Do you know where Raphael Gardet is?

701
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:10,657
- Who are you?
- I'm Dave.

702
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:12,526
Hi, Dave.

703
00:47:13,463 --> 00:47:15,192
Are you one of the models?

704
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,990
No. Are you the hairdresser?

705
00:47:18,068 --> 00:47:20,127
- Excuse me?
- I think you heard me.

706
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:22,237
Diana, eyes to me.

707
00:47:22,806 --> 00:47:24,034
That's great.

708
00:47:26,476 --> 00:47:28,171
Are you the hairdresser?

709
00:47:30,547 --> 00:47:33,277
That was good.
I really enjoyed that.

710
00:47:37,154 --> 00:47:39,622
I just asked him simply,
"Do you know where...

711
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:42,420
..."Raphael Gardet is?" And he gives me
all this attitude like I'm some...

712
00:47:42,492 --> 00:47:44,824
Whatever. Jesus, Dave.
It's so uncool.

713
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:46,692
The guy's a schmuck.
Schmuck?

714
00:47:46,763 --> 00:47:48,526
It's who I work for.

715
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:51,568
Who are you?
What are you thinking?

716
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:54,367
I got cut to
one day a week at work.

717
00:47:54,438 --> 00:47:56,429
Then I find out I gotta be
out of my place on Monday.

718
00:47:56,506 --> 00:47:58,406
I'm gonna be broke
in a month.

719
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:02,075
But I'm sorry, okay?

720
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:04,174
I am sorry.

721
00:48:10,587 --> 00:48:12,919
Okay, let's do something.
It's Friday night.

722
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:15,618
What do you want to do?
Start observing the Sabbath or something?

723
00:48:15,692 --> 00:48:16,681
No.

724
00:48:18,595 --> 00:48:21,120
I wanna know what a normal
Friday night was like for you...

725
00:48:21,198 --> 00:48:22,597
.. before you met me.

726
00:48:22,766 --> 00:48:25,098
I mean, you didn't sit
around fireplaces in The Village...

727
00:48:25,168 --> 00:48:26,863
...drinking merlot, did you?

728
00:48:27,271 --> 00:48:31,264
Actually, we stood around trash-can
fires in the Bowery drinking 40s.

729
00:48:35,545 --> 00:48:37,069
Come on.
What?

730
00:48:37,948 --> 00:48:40,610
I wanna know
what you did. Show me.

731
00:48:41,385 --> 00:48:43,046
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

732
00:49:17,154 --> 00:49:19,714
Let's go to your place.
We never go to your place.

733
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:22,122
I got roommates, Rafi.
Rafi...

734
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:25,423
I wanna see
your paintings.

735
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:28,522
You're not missing much.

736
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:30,664
Convenient and weak.

737
00:49:32,703 --> 00:49:34,694
I wanna go,
I wanna go right now.

738
00:49:34,771 --> 00:49:37,740
I want to see where you sleep
when you're not in my bed.

739
00:50:02,432 --> 00:50:03,899
This is nice.

740
00:50:12,476 --> 00:50:13,465
Kitchen.

741
00:50:13,543 --> 00:50:15,272
- Very grown-up.
- Yeah.

742
00:50:26,089 --> 00:50:27,647
- David?
- Yeah.

743
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:29,391
Who are your roommates?

744
00:50:29,659 --> 00:50:31,354
Is that you, David?

745
00:50:33,263 --> 00:50:35,493
Yes.
Go to sleep, Grandma.

746
00:50:40,003 --> 00:50:42,972
Come on. Give me a break.
It's embarrassing enough, all right?

747
00:50:44,341 --> 00:50:46,969
Where's the bathroom?
Bathroom's right there.

748
00:50:47,978 --> 00:50:51,573
- Did you eat?
- Yes, I ate. Good night.

749
00:51:09,332 --> 00:51:10,663
What are you doing?

750
00:51:11,435 --> 00:51:12,993
Stashing all your pornos?

751
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,903
Yeah, and all my posters
had to come down, too.

752
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:28,608
- Why are they all facing away?
- I don't know.

753
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:31,510
Who wants to look
at my paintings all day?

754
00:51:33,957 --> 00:51:35,515
We have to talk...

755
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:39,128
...about this thing you have
with your art.

756
00:51:39,196 --> 00:51:40,561
I mean, it's weird.

757
00:51:41,565 --> 00:51:44,056
It's like you think
it's a sin or something.

758
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:47,494
<i>Bubi?</i>

759
00:51:48,738 --> 00:51:50,535
I've decided
I'm gonna be an artist.

760
00:52:15,265 --> 00:52:16,391
Dave!

761
00:52:17,601 --> 00:52:19,034
You're really good.

762
00:52:19,402 --> 00:52:22,633
This is what you should be doing.
You've got to keep painting.

763
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:25,633
Yeah?

764
00:52:27,177 --> 00:52:28,542
It's not a life.

765
00:52:28,612 --> 00:52:31,240
Says who?
You're crazy.

766
00:52:55,205 --> 00:52:58,299
You're lucky. I'm just
paving the way for you.

767
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:02,078
This is the curse
of the eldest child.

768
00:53:02,646 --> 00:53:05,342
When it's all over
you'll be able to bring home Jay-Z.

769
00:53:05,415 --> 00:53:07,849
- Are you and Mom talking?
- Not really.

770
00:53:08,718 --> 00:53:10,845
She's just a different person
these days.

771
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:15,082
- What are you doing?
- I'm just dropping off some clothes.

772
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:17,053
You're not going to stay here?

773
00:53:17,827 --> 00:53:19,294
I'm going to Morris' place.

774
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:22,054
To tell you the truth,
I didn't even think you'd want me here.

775
00:53:22,132 --> 00:53:23,497
Don't be melodramatic.

776
00:53:23,633 --> 00:53:25,498
This is your home.
We're your family.

777
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:28,303
Even if
you did bring home Jay-D.

778
00:53:28,638 --> 00:53:29,866
It's Jay-Z, Mom.

779
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:34,807
- Whatever.
- Jay-B, Jay-D...

780
00:53:35,745 --> 00:53:38,305
I have a patient coming,
so be careful when you leave.

781
00:54:00,804 --> 00:54:05,002
Oh, I'm so sorry
to keep you waiting.

782
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:07,009
- Did I knock?
- Am I late?

783
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,708
I feel like I'm late.

784
00:54:12,349 --> 00:54:13,839
- But no.
- No!

785
00:54:14,384 --> 00:54:15,908
Sit, sit, sit.

786
00:54:17,787 --> 00:54:19,778
What is that?
A gun?

787
00:54:19,856 --> 00:54:21,517
No, it's a yoga mat.

788
00:54:28,031 --> 00:54:29,862
- He's moving in with me.
- What?

789
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:35,602
I thought you said...
Weren't you just saying...

790
00:54:35,672 --> 00:54:38,573
...that he couldn't provide you
with the things that you needed?

791
00:54:38,642 --> 00:54:40,109
I'm still unsure.

792
00:54:40,176 --> 00:54:42,167
But I think
I should just give it a shot.

793
00:54:42,712 --> 00:54:45,306
I mean, you always say,
"Just get messy in life.

794
00:54:45,382 --> 00:54:47,475
"At least you know
you're living. " Right?

795
00:54:48,385 --> 00:54:50,615
Besides, if he can't give me
what I need...

796
00:54:50,687 --> 00:54:52,985
...then I'll find out sooner
if he's living with me.

797
00:54:54,357 --> 00:54:56,757
- And he has nowhere to go.
- He said that?

798
00:54:57,761 --> 00:54:59,353
His best friend has a studio.

799
00:54:59,429 --> 00:55:02,523
He's not getting along
with his mother, so he can't go home.

800
00:55:03,333 --> 00:55:05,563
She hates me, by the way.
Did I tell you that?

801
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:07,963
No. You hadn't mentioned it.

802
00:55:08,038 --> 00:55:09,835
Yes, it's this
whole other thing...

803
00:55:09,906 --> 00:55:11,897
...that I'm trying
not to even think about.

804
00:55:12,742 --> 00:55:14,505
They say the children
of psychoanalysts...

805
00:55:14,577 --> 00:55:15,942
...are the most
screwed up of all.

806
00:55:16,513 --> 00:55:18,003
Yes, I had heard that.

807
00:55:18,915 --> 00:55:21,110
So he's moving in.

808
00:55:21,584 --> 00:55:22,881
I think it'll be fun.

809
00:55:22,952 --> 00:55:24,783
That's what you said
to do with this, right?

810
00:55:24,854 --> 00:55:26,822
I mean, just have fun.

811
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:29,383
That's right.
That's right.

812
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:30,891
What are you
looking at?

813
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,428
I... I forgot,
I have a book...

814
00:55:33,763 --> 00:55:37,494
A book...
A book I wanted to show you.

815
00:55:37,567 --> 00:55:38,898
Thought it might be...

816
00:55:38,968 --> 00:55:41,129
<i>"Lesbians
and the Kabbalah...</i>

817
00:55:41,204 --> 00:55:42,796
<i>"A Match Made in Heaven. "</i>

818
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:46,070
Wrong book.
Wrong book. Wrong...

819
00:55:46,142 --> 00:55:48,406
Oh, my.
Oh, well, never mind.

820
00:55:52,382 --> 00:55:54,612
Forget it.
I'm sorry.

821
00:56:02,625 --> 00:56:05,560
I am so late.

822
00:56:05,929 --> 00:56:07,556
I can't help it
if you parade around...

823
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:10,121
...fulfilling every working-girl
fantasy I've ever had.

824
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:13,700
You should wear a garbage bag
till you get to the elevator.

825
00:56:16,573 --> 00:56:18,302
Hey, are we still going
to the Hamptons Friday?

826
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:20,002
Yeah. See you.

827
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:06,748
Great.
Village People weekend.

828
00:57:07,357 --> 00:57:08,517
You'll be fine.

829
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:10,115
I've been grooming you
for this moment.

830
00:57:10,193 --> 00:57:14,653
A Bette Davis marathon on the
Turner Classic Network hardly qualifies.

831
00:57:14,731 --> 00:57:17,199
Hey, you guys, they're here.
Come on.

832
00:57:20,403 --> 00:57:23,429
- Hi. How are you?
- Hey, Jason.

833
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:27,004
- ou look great.
- You do, too.

834
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:28,700
- Dave, this is Jason.
- Hi.

835
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:30,245
Hi. We've heard
all about you.

836
00:57:30,313 --> 00:57:31,837
Hi.
Raphael!

837
00:57:32,715 --> 00:57:34,774
Hello.
Hello.

838
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:37,913
It's so good
to see you again.

839
00:57:38,254 --> 00:57:39,346
- How are you?
- I'm good.

840
00:57:39,422 --> 00:57:40,719
- How was the drive?
- It was good.

841
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:41,779
Good.
Brilliant.

842
00:57:41,858 --> 00:57:43,849
- Palmer, this is Dave.
- Hi.

843
00:57:43,927 --> 00:57:46,259
- How are you?
- Great. How are you doing?

844
00:57:46,329 --> 00:57:47,626
Great.
- Yeah?

845
00:57:47,697 --> 00:57:48,686
Is he okay? Or...

846
00:57:48,765 --> 00:57:52,223
Ignore him. He's just jealous
he didn't get into your pants first.

847
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:56,465
Hey, what's up?

848
00:57:56,573 --> 00:57:59,201
Oh, my God!
I am so sorry.

849
00:57:59,275 --> 00:58:01,402
- Alsayste,
- you junkie!

850
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:03,070
- It's so he won't bark.
- Are you okay?

851
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:04,408
Yeah.
I think I'm blind.

852
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:06,676
Oh, no.
Gotta call the pediatrician.

853
00:58:06,749 --> 00:58:08,080
All right, come on.

854
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,720
That stings.
That's terrible.

855
00:58:14,757 --> 00:58:16,657
This place is amazing.

856
00:58:17,527 --> 00:58:21,054
I mean, everything.
Every room is perfect.

857
00:58:22,232 --> 00:58:25,429
Look at this.
Even the beds are awesome.

858
00:58:28,238 --> 00:58:30,399
We're gonna have
vacation sex tonight.

859
00:58:30,473 --> 00:58:32,532
What's vacation sex, Dave?

860
00:58:32,976 --> 00:58:35,137
I don't know,
but you're gonna get it, girl.

861
00:58:37,547 --> 00:58:39,947
Look at this, even the breeze
coming through here.

862
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:41,176
This is perfect.

863
00:58:42,385 --> 00:58:43,818
Is it like this for all rich people?

864
00:58:43,887 --> 00:58:45,878
No, just gay rich people.

865
00:58:46,656 --> 00:58:48,214
- You're gonna get it.
- Oh, yeah?

866
00:58:48,625 --> 00:58:50,024
I'm gonna give it to you.

867
00:58:54,163 --> 00:58:55,858
Vacation sex, Dave?

868
00:59:00,937 --> 00:59:02,495
Please. You are the only...

869
00:59:02,572 --> 00:59:04,096
...registered gay Republican
in New York.

870
00:59:04,173 --> 00:59:05,538
It's just a tax thing.

871
00:59:05,608 --> 00:59:07,337
I'm to the left
on every other issue.

872
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:10,641
I still say the Democrats need their
own show pushing their own agenda.

873
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:12,772
No one would watch.
I mean, there's no blood.

874
00:59:12,849 --> 00:59:14,339
I'd watch that show.

875
00:59:14,417 --> 00:59:17,284
People would much rather watch
some liberal be humiliated...

876
00:59:17,353 --> 00:59:18,718
<i>on The O'Reilly Factor.</i>

877
00:59:20,123 --> 00:59:21,488
You should go on, Jason...

878
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:22,786
...and thoroughly
humiliate the man.

879
00:59:22,859 --> 00:59:24,486
Sure, he'd love me.

880
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:27,121
- Alsayste? Where is he?
- I'll get him.

881
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:36,933
- Fiddler on a hot tin roof.
- And so young. Have you carded him?

882
00:59:37,006 --> 00:59:39,406
Yes, unfortunately, I have.

883
00:59:39,475 --> 00:59:42,535
I think he's great. Smart and sweet.
Just needs a little seasoning.

884
00:59:42,612 --> 00:59:43,601
I think he's...

885
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:46,205
You don't get to say.
You're totally infatuated with him.

886
00:59:46,316 --> 00:59:48,648
Maybe,
but I'm still worried about you.

887
00:59:48,718 --> 00:59:51,710
He is so young and you're
obviously falling for him.

888
00:59:51,788 --> 00:59:54,154
So what? Fall.

889
00:59:54,223 --> 00:59:56,657
You look 10 years younger.
I've never seen you this happy.

890
00:59:56,726 --> 00:59:58,387
I'm just saying,
you want a baby...

891
00:59:58,461 --> 01:00:00,258
...and he is in no position
to give you that.

892
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:03,094
- You're on the clock, Rafi.
- Thanks, Randall. That's sweet.

893
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:05,760
Plus, he has this weird relationship
with his mother...

894
01:00:05,835 --> 01:00:08,963
...who wants him to marry
someone named Rivkah or Devorah.

895
01:00:09,038 --> 01:00:10,096
Randall, who asked you?

896
01:00:10,173 --> 01:00:11,401
Besides, I think it's interesting...

897
01:00:11,474 --> 01:00:12,941
...that you call
their relationship weird...

898
01:00:13,009 --> 01:00:15,000
...when all it is, is close.

899
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:16,772
We should all be so lucky.

900
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:20,274
Besides, your mother still thinks
you're straight, for Christ's sakes.

901
01:00:23,319 --> 01:00:26,015
So, Dave, do you care
if your kids are Jewish?

902
01:00:29,659 --> 01:00:31,092
I care if they're happy.

903
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:33,087
Good answer.

904
01:00:35,231 --> 01:00:36,892
So, what's up
with your friends?

905
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:39,059
This whole weekend felt
like a long audition.

906
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:41,660
- They're just worried about me.
- Worried about what?

907
01:00:41,738 --> 01:00:43,262
How old you are,
I mean...

908
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:46,033
...my wanting to have a child
at some point.

909
01:00:46,109 --> 01:00:47,736
Your moving in.

910
01:00:48,211 --> 01:00:50,202
And I'm just a little nervous,
that's all.

911
01:00:50,747 --> 01:00:53,944
You know how it is in New York.
Your apartment's all you have.

912
01:00:54,417 --> 01:00:57,250
A few hundred square feet
you can call your own.

913
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:10,298
The work's strong,
I mean, it's realistic portraits...

914
01:01:10,366 --> 01:01:12,459
...and he's only 23,
I was amazed.

915
01:01:12,535 --> 01:01:15,834
Sounds great. I'd really like
to take a look at his work.

916
01:01:16,406 --> 01:01:18,670
- Is he here?
- Yes, he is.

917
01:01:18,741 --> 01:01:20,038
- Great.
- He'd love that.

918
01:01:20,109 --> 01:01:21,201
- Let me go find him.
- Okay.

919
01:01:25,081 --> 01:01:26,446
I want you to see this.
Come here.

920
01:01:27,617 --> 01:01:28,743
Raphael.

921
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:31,119
- How are you, honey?
- How you doing?

922
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:32,381
- Good to see you.
- Nice to see you.

923
01:01:32,455 --> 01:01:33,854
Have you met
my friend Ann?

924
01:01:33,923 --> 01:01:34,981
Hi.

925
01:01:35,058 --> 01:01:36,423
Nice to meet you.
I've got my hands full.

926
01:01:36,492 --> 01:01:40,223
- You sure do. Gosh, she's beautiful.
- Thank you.

927
01:01:40,797 --> 01:01:42,458
- What's her name?
- Ella.

928
01:01:43,566 --> 01:01:45,397
You're so sweet.

929
01:01:46,235 --> 01:01:48,066
- How old is she?
- She's one.

930
01:01:48,137 --> 01:01:50,662
- Oh, my goodness.
- Yeah, she's a big girl.

931
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:52,173
Do you have any children?

932
01:01:52,241 --> 01:01:53,936
No, I don't have any children.

933
01:01:55,745 --> 01:01:59,010
She's just started walking.
She's holding onto the railing...

934
01:02:00,817 --> 01:02:02,614
Oh, she's so sweet.

935
01:02:15,298 --> 01:02:16,424
Hey, baby.

936
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:18,289
Hey!

937
01:02:19,602 --> 01:02:22,400
Do you know you have over
500 channels on this thing?

938
01:02:22,472 --> 01:02:24,565
I watched the Malaysian
Grand Prix today.

939
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:27,108
Really? That's amazing.

940
01:02:29,445 --> 01:02:31,675
Have you left the apartment
since this morning?

941
01:02:34,350 --> 01:02:36,341
No. Why?

942
01:02:37,854 --> 01:02:39,981
<i>He sits around all day
in my apartment.</i>

943
01:02:40,056 --> 01:02:42,183
I have zero privacy
when I go home.

944
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:44,624
This does not sound good.
He needs to get his own place.

945
01:02:44,694 --> 01:02:46,753
Yeah,
but he needs a job first.

946
01:02:46,829 --> 01:02:47,989
It's about time.

947
01:02:48,064 --> 01:02:50,225
I need to buy him
a birthday present this week.

948
01:02:50,299 --> 01:02:51,527
Do you have any ideas?

949
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:54,468
There's this Nintendo thing
he keeps on talking about and...

950
01:02:55,037 --> 01:02:56,561
Rafi, let me
ask you something.

951
01:02:57,673 --> 01:02:58,935
Do you like having sex?

952
01:03:03,913 --> 01:03:05,141
Don't get Nintendo.

953
01:03:11,354 --> 01:03:12,480
Are you coming to bed?

954
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:14,923
Yeah,
right after this game.

955
01:03:24,767 --> 01:03:26,291
Just for a sec.

956
01:03:26,435 --> 01:03:27,697
- Okay.
- What can it hurt?

957
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:30,432
- I've got to get back.
- We'll just look, all right?

958
01:03:36,279 --> 01:03:39,214
- How much is this?
- Much too much. Don't look.

959
01:03:39,282 --> 01:03:40,715
Don't even look.

960
01:04:04,774 --> 01:04:06,639
- May I help you?
- What?

961
01:04:07,310 --> 01:04:08,607
- May I...
- No.

962
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:38,072
- Jack.
- What?

963
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:39,402
- We have to go.
- Why?

964
01:04:39,475 --> 01:04:40,965
I have an appointment
I forgot about.

965
01:04:41,043 --> 01:04:43,739
- I thought you said you didn't...
- I just have to go, all right?

966
01:04:43,813 --> 01:04:45,110
- Why?
- Shit!

967
01:04:45,181 --> 01:04:46,808
- Get down, get down.
Why?

968
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:53,886
- It's a patient?
- No, it's my lover.

969
01:04:53,956 --> 01:04:55,981
Yes, it's a patient.
Just be quiet.

970
01:05:07,136 --> 01:05:10,264
- You're gonna have to explain this.
- You know I can't.

971
01:05:12,508 --> 01:05:14,942
Okay. You're scaring
some of the customers.

972
01:05:24,153 --> 01:05:25,780
Just dropped a contact.

973
01:05:32,695 --> 01:05:34,754
<i>I was married to a man
who couldn't love me.</i>

974
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:37,759
And now I'm with someone
who can love me...

975
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:41,931
...but he's not really a man.
At least, not all the time.

976
01:05:42,805 --> 01:05:44,272
I can see that.

977
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:48,606
Maybe if I give myself
to him completely...

978
01:05:49,245 --> 01:05:51,372
...he'll step up
in the ways I need him to.

979
01:05:51,714 --> 01:05:54,046
He said he knows
I'm not giving all of myself...

980
01:05:54,116 --> 01:05:55,515
...and it's unfair to us.

981
01:05:58,321 --> 01:06:01,381
I don't think
I can do this anymore.

982
01:06:02,525 --> 01:06:03,856
I'm sorry.

983
01:06:05,061 --> 01:06:06,790
I just can't.

984
01:06:07,063 --> 01:06:08,291
Do what?

985
01:06:15,137 --> 01:06:17,071
We need to talk, Rafi.

986
01:06:19,742 --> 01:06:20,834
Okay.

987
01:06:21,277 --> 01:06:22,710
He's my son.

988
01:06:23,946 --> 01:06:25,004
Who?

989
01:06:52,775 --> 01:06:55,266
Why does it say Lisa Metzger
on your door?

990
01:06:55,878 --> 01:06:57,903
Metzger is my maiden name.

991
01:07:01,817 --> 01:07:03,284
You betrayed me.

992
01:07:05,654 --> 01:07:06,746
Yes.

993
01:07:07,723 --> 01:07:09,486
I did betray your trust...

994
01:07:09,558 --> 01:07:12,891
...but I did it
to preserve our relationship.

995
01:07:12,962 --> 01:07:15,021
That seemed
more important to me.

996
01:07:16,365 --> 01:07:18,856
Is this what you call
preserving our relationship?

997
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:23,566
It seemed at the time
like the right thing to do.

998
01:07:24,206 --> 01:07:27,004
What do you mean, at the time?
How long have you known?

999
01:07:29,011 --> 01:07:30,740
Five weeks, four days.

1000
01:07:31,113 --> 01:07:34,105
I wanted to make sure
that it wasn't just a fling.

1001
01:07:34,183 --> 01:07:37,914
If it was, then we would
have been ableto continue, but...

1002
01:07:38,421 --> 01:07:40,321
Now we're having
a conversation...

1003
01:07:40,389 --> 01:07:43,415
...that will very likely end
our work together.

1004
01:07:44,026 --> 01:07:45,254
Can you see...

1005
01:07:45,327 --> 01:07:48,524
...that I wanted to avoid
having this conversation...

1006
01:07:50,266 --> 01:07:51,893
...for your benefit?

1007
01:07:52,034 --> 01:07:55,265
No. I think you did it
to control your son's life.

1008
01:07:55,337 --> 01:07:57,635
No. That's not true.
That is not true.

1009
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:01,100
I stayed in it just for you,
no other reason.

1010
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:02,672
I don't believe you.

1011
01:08:03,446 --> 01:08:06,040
That you could give me advice
to do as I please...

1012
01:08:07,149 --> 01:08:09,709
...and then not do the same
for your son is wrong.

1013
01:08:11,053 --> 01:08:12,884
I think you need
to look at that.

1014
01:08:13,222 --> 01:08:16,953
Thank you. I am working
on that with my therapist right now.

1015
01:08:19,395 --> 01:08:22,455
You let me talk to you
about his penis.

1016
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:28,302
Trust me, that was harder
for me than it was for you.

1017
01:08:30,072 --> 01:08:33,303
Up until a few weeks ago,
I didn't even think my son had a penis.

1018
01:08:36,912 --> 01:08:41,474
Do you realize your mother now knows
intimate details about your penis?

1019
01:08:42,818 --> 01:08:44,285
You told her
about my penis?

1020
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:46,982
Jesus, Rafi.

1021
01:08:47,056 --> 01:08:48,284
Excuse me...

1022
01:08:48,357 --> 01:08:50,917
I thought it was safe
to assume it wouldn't get back to her.

1023
01:08:51,427 --> 01:08:53,861
She better not use that
to get me home for Thanksgiving.

1024
01:08:54,964 --> 01:08:57,933
How can you make jokes?
What else am I gonna do?

1025
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,662
Get angry! Be outraged!

1026
01:09:00,736 --> 01:09:02,829
I am, okay?
I am angry.

1027
01:09:02,905 --> 01:09:04,600
I can't believe
she took it this far.

1028
01:09:04,673 --> 01:09:07,642
I'm just... I know that
she cares about the people she helps.

1029
01:09:07,710 --> 01:09:09,644
- And she cares a lot.
- What is wrong with you?

1030
01:09:09,712 --> 01:09:11,976
- I have to draw the line there.
- You're delusional.

1031
01:09:12,047 --> 01:09:14,072
She's just trying to control you.
She still is.

1032
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:15,708
Rafi, I'm not arguing with you.

1033
01:09:15,784 --> 01:09:18,753
I know she tries to
control me. I hate it. I do.

1034
01:09:19,588 --> 01:09:20,577
But...

1035
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:23,757
All I'm saying is,
she would never use you to do that.

1036
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:25,851
You are so naive.

1037
01:09:27,096 --> 01:09:30,122
How could you deceive her like that?
That was totally unethical!

1038
01:09:30,366 --> 01:09:34,462
How dare you? I care far more
about her well-being than you do.

1039
01:09:34,537 --> 01:09:38,132
That's evident by your choice
in continuing to see her.

1040
01:09:38,207 --> 01:09:39,265
<i>Mom.</i>

1041
01:09:39,808 --> 01:09:41,105
What are you going to do now?

1042
01:09:41,977 --> 01:09:43,035
Live a life.

1043
01:09:43,112 --> 01:09:44,909
<i>I hope you're making
the right decisions...</i>

1044
01:09:44,980 --> 01:09:47,107
<i>...because you've got
somebody else counting on you now.</i>

1045
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:49,481
That's fine. I can handle it.
I love her.

1046
01:09:49,552 --> 01:09:52,419
Great. Just don't come to me,
help you clean up the mess.

1047
01:09:52,488 --> 01:09:53,614
I won't.

1048
01:09:53,689 --> 01:09:56,522
I mean, there won't be
a mess to clean up, Mom.

1049
01:09:56,859 --> 01:09:59,089
And I didn't buy you Q-Tips...

1050
01:09:59,328 --> 01:10:01,796
...because I was trying
to protect your ears.

1051
01:10:12,908 --> 01:10:14,876
So what? She's just gonna
let you live there rent-free?

1052
01:10:14,944 --> 01:10:17,071
No, it ain't free.
I'm paying in other ways.

1053
01:10:17,146 --> 01:10:18,613
Oh, my God,
you're my hero.

1054
01:10:18,681 --> 01:10:20,239
No, it's not like that.

1055
01:10:20,316 --> 01:10:22,341
This whole thing with
my mother has just killed her.

1056
01:10:22,418 --> 01:10:24,852
She's, like, impossible
to live with these days.

1057
01:10:25,321 --> 01:10:27,687
This is it.
You wanna wait outside or...

1058
01:10:27,756 --> 01:10:30,156
No, I thought I'd stand
next to you with some paper towels.

1059
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:31,454
I'll meet you back at Rafi's.

1060
01:10:31,527 --> 01:10:32,619
I want you to
check out her place.

1061
01:10:32,695 --> 01:10:34,822
She's not going to be back
for a couple of hours.

1062
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:37,127
Can't believe
you haven't made Page Six yet.

1063
01:10:40,302 --> 01:10:42,327
- You know what? This place is sick.
- I know.

1064
01:10:42,404 --> 01:10:44,429
Now I understand
why you're taking all her shit.

1065
01:10:44,506 --> 01:10:45,803
That's not why.

1066
01:10:46,308 --> 01:10:49,573
I mean, I like living here,
but that's not the reason I'm with her.

1067
01:10:51,347 --> 01:10:55,215
Great apartment, friends with houses
in the Hamptons, art connections.

1068
01:10:55,284 --> 01:10:57,081
Those are good reasons.
You know what I mean?

1069
01:10:57,152 --> 01:10:58,380
- Shut up.
- What?

1070
01:10:58,454 --> 01:11:01,116
Come on, man, she's got you
tied up like it's Pelican Bay.

1071
01:11:02,391 --> 01:11:04,484
Seriously,
I barely even see you anymore.

1072
01:11:04,693 --> 01:11:07,491
You even said it. I'm only here right now
because she's not home.

1073
01:11:14,036 --> 01:11:15,230
Shit.

1074
01:11:15,304 --> 01:11:17,772
It's her. Come on.
You've got to hide.

1075
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,671
Are you serious?
I really can't be here?

1076
01:11:19,742 --> 01:11:21,437
- Yeah. No. Get in the closet.
- In the closet?

1077
01:11:21,510 --> 01:11:23,978
Get in the closet. She doesn't
like people in her living space.

1078
01:11:24,046 --> 01:11:25,673
Living space?
What the hell's living space?

1079
01:11:25,748 --> 01:11:27,682
Is the kitchen part of it?
Just get in the closet.

1080
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:28,739
Jesus Christ.

1081
01:11:35,591 --> 01:11:36,580
What's up?

1082
01:11:39,161 --> 01:11:40,992
What are you
doing home already?

1083
01:11:41,397 --> 01:11:43,592
Oh, I'm sorry.
Would you like me to leave?

1084
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:47,231
I thought you were hanging out
with Morris today.

1085
01:11:47,503 --> 01:11:50,404
Oh, yeah, drink that.
That's good stuff, huh?

1086
01:11:50,472 --> 01:11:52,201
I was. I mean, I am.

1087
01:11:52,708 --> 01:11:53,868
I mean, hanging out...

1088
01:11:53,942 --> 01:11:55,569
What's wrong with you?
You're acting weird.

1089
01:11:55,644 --> 01:11:58,010
Me? No, I'm fine.
You okay?

1090
01:12:01,216 --> 01:12:04,117
- Is there someone here?
- What? No.

1091
01:12:05,688 --> 01:12:07,713
Oh, my God, is there
someone here with you?

1092
01:12:15,230 --> 01:12:16,390
I'm allergic to...

1093
01:12:16,465 --> 01:12:18,365
- What is going on here?
- Okay, okay...

1094
01:12:19,301 --> 01:12:20,859
All right,
look.

1095
01:12:21,236 --> 01:12:23,761
We were only here for a few minutes.
Then I heard you coming...

1096
01:12:23,839 --> 01:12:26,069
...and I panicked,
and I told him to hide.

1097
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:28,367
- In the closet?
- I told him it was a bad idea.

1098
01:12:28,444 --> 01:12:30,275
Rafi, we were
only here just...

1099
01:12:30,346 --> 01:12:33,804
Long enough to have a beer
with your pie-throwing, sociopath friend?

1100
01:12:33,882 --> 01:12:37,249
- Wait. Hey, hey.
- No. Wait. I told him...

1101
01:12:37,786 --> 01:12:39,583
I told you not to come up,
but you forced me.

1102
01:12:39,655 --> 01:12:40,815
- No, you did not.
- You lie...

1103
01:12:40,889 --> 01:12:42,288
Wait, wait, wait.

1104
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:44,349
Is that better or worse
than a psychopath?

1105
01:12:44,426 --> 01:12:46,189
What is wrong with you?

1106
01:12:46,428 --> 01:12:48,419
I can't believe
I have to come home to this.

1107
01:12:48,497 --> 01:12:50,965
People hiding in the closet,
you're lying.

1108
01:12:51,033 --> 01:12:53,001
You're a goddamn preschooler,
Dave!

1109
01:12:53,068 --> 01:12:55,263
You've had me on lockdown
since the minute I moved in here.

1110
01:12:55,337 --> 01:12:56,326
- What?
- Yeah.

1111
01:12:56,405 --> 01:12:59,238
You tell me you want me here
and then you treat me like an inmate.

1112
01:12:59,308 --> 01:13:02,471
An inmate? I mean, you barely carry
your weight around here, Dave.

1113
01:13:02,544 --> 01:13:05,411
I do everything and
you can't even clean up the place.

1114
01:13:05,748 --> 01:13:07,181
The one thing I ask of you...

1115
01:13:07,249 --> 01:13:09,683
...is that you would tell me
when you bring someone here.

1116
01:13:09,752 --> 01:13:12,118
Rafi, this is not
such a big deal, okay?

1117
01:13:12,187 --> 01:13:13,518
You need to get over it.

1118
01:13:13,589 --> 01:13:15,955
I'm not Francis.

1119
01:13:16,024 --> 01:13:18,686
I'm not lying to you.
I'm not cheating on you.

1120
01:13:18,761 --> 01:13:20,626
- I'm definitelynot avoiding you.
- Thanks.

1121
01:13:20,696 --> 01:13:23,631
That's reassuring and in really,
really good taste.

1122
01:13:26,702 --> 01:13:28,226
You know what?
I...

1123
01:13:29,204 --> 01:13:30,466
...I can't do
this anymore.

1124
01:13:30,539 --> 01:13:32,302
You should get a dog
if you wanna give orders...

1125
01:13:32,374 --> 01:13:34,535
...'cause I really don't
give a shit anymore!

1126
01:13:35,878 --> 01:13:36,867
Let's go.

1127
01:13:55,364 --> 01:13:56,922
I missed you like crazy.

1128
01:14:03,005 --> 01:14:06,304
I think we need to take a break, Dave,
and start seeing other people.

1129
01:14:08,844 --> 01:14:09,936
What?

1130
01:14:13,115 --> 01:14:16,516
I can't do this.
This just isn't right for me...

1131
01:14:17,953 --> 01:14:19,853
...and I can't
trust you anymore.

1132
01:14:20,322 --> 01:14:22,586
I was only showing him
your place for a minute. I just...

1133
01:14:22,658 --> 01:14:23,989
It's not just that.

1134
01:14:28,497 --> 01:14:31,660
You're in no place
to give me what I need.

1135
01:14:33,035 --> 01:14:34,263
I get that.

1136
01:14:34,536 --> 01:14:36,527
And then this whole thing
with your mother...

1137
01:14:36,605 --> 01:14:38,163
...I don't even know
what to say about that.

1138
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:39,434
It's crazy.

1139
01:14:40,809 --> 01:14:42,868
But just think the reason
she stopped seeing you...

1140
01:14:42,945 --> 01:14:45,209
...is because she believes
that we're in love.

1141
01:14:51,753 --> 01:14:53,243
It's just...

1142
01:14:54,590 --> 01:14:57,058
It's just not gonna work out.
At least, not now.

1143
01:14:59,461 --> 01:15:00,894
So that's it?

1144
01:15:07,002 --> 01:15:08,094
Rafi.

1145
01:15:22,384 --> 01:15:24,375
You don't look as relieved
as you predicted.

1146
01:15:25,687 --> 01:15:28,315
Are you kidding?
I'm devastated.

1147
01:15:29,625 --> 01:15:33,994
I hurt my patient so that
she could have a relationship with my son.

1148
01:15:34,596 --> 01:15:35,927
And so what happens?

1149
01:15:36,498 --> 01:15:37,988
My son hurts my patient.

1150
01:15:39,301 --> 01:15:40,666
And now...

1151
01:15:41,103 --> 01:15:43,901
...my patient hurts my son.

1152
01:15:47,376 --> 01:15:50,106
I'm totally confused
about my part in this.

1153
01:15:50,178 --> 01:15:52,806
I think you did
the right thing, Lisa.

1154
01:15:53,348 --> 01:15:55,213
You know,
even love won't guarantee...

1155
01:15:55,284 --> 01:15:57,479
...that they're not going to
hurt one another.

1156
01:15:57,553 --> 01:16:00,351
If anything,
it just makes it a likelihood.

1157
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:16,003
Thanks for coming down.

1158
01:16:16,438 --> 01:16:18,463
Sorry the place
is such a mess.

1159
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:22,067
Rafi thought I'd like
your work and I trust her judgment.

1160
01:16:22,444 --> 01:16:24,036
Yeah, well, we broke up.

1161
01:16:25,447 --> 01:16:27,438
I'm sorry.
I didn't know.

1162
01:16:27,983 --> 01:16:30,850
- She didn't say anything about it?
- No.

1163
01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:43,058
These are great.

1164
01:16:43,332 --> 01:16:45,266
- Do you have a gallery?
- No.

1165
01:16:46,234 --> 01:16:47,724
How much for
the larger pieces?

1166
01:16:48,870 --> 01:16:50,565
I don't know.
I never sold one before.

1167
01:16:50,973 --> 01:16:53,134
I'll give you $1,000 each
for these two.

1168
01:16:53,275 --> 01:16:55,334
And I'll see what I can do
about getting you a show.

1169
01:16:58,614 --> 01:16:59,706
Done.

1170
01:17:01,883 --> 01:17:02,907
I don't believe it.

1171
01:17:02,985 --> 01:17:05,852
You're gonna be a huge painter
and I get to go along for the ride.

1172
01:17:08,256 --> 01:17:10,816
Maybe I can write this whole pie
thing off as performance art.

1173
01:17:10,892 --> 01:17:12,223
What do you think?

1174
01:17:13,028 --> 01:17:14,188
- Who you calling?
- Rafi.

1175
01:17:14,262 --> 01:17:15,923
- Why?
- I want to tell her how it went.

1176
01:17:15,998 --> 01:17:18,364
Plus I want to kick her a few bucks
for the time I spent there.

1177
01:17:18,433 --> 01:17:20,264
- She'll appreciate it.
- What am I, chopped liver?

1178
01:17:20,335 --> 01:17:22,667
I'm gonna pretend you didn't
say that. You're the reason...

1179
01:17:22,738 --> 01:17:24,638
<i>All right, all right.
I'm not in right now.</i>

1180
01:17:24,706 --> 01:17:26,435
Does this mean you're gonna get
your own place now?

1181
01:17:26,508 --> 01:17:27,770
<i>- Shut up.
- Thanks.</i>

1182
01:17:28,944 --> 01:17:31,378
Hey, Raff,
it's me again. Listen...

1183
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:34,014
...I have some amazing news
for you. Please pick up.

1184
01:17:35,050 --> 01:17:36,711
Rafi, Rafi.

1185
01:17:37,319 --> 01:17:38,479
Hello?

1186
01:18:15,824 --> 01:18:17,587
Why don't you call him, then?

1187
01:18:35,777 --> 01:18:39,338
I like it, man.
It's very The Early Years, you know?

1188
01:18:40,048 --> 01:18:42,243
A little roach problem,
but you can fix that.

1189
01:18:43,118 --> 01:18:45,552
It's gonna look good when A&E
comes to shoot the documentary.

1190
01:18:45,620 --> 01:18:46,780
He lived on
rugalach and macaroons...

1191
01:18:46,855 --> 01:18:48,584
...for the first four years
during his Blue Period...

1192
01:18:48,657 --> 01:18:49,715
Would you shut up?

1193
01:18:49,791 --> 01:18:50,815
...and then moved on
to the Louvre.

1194
01:18:50,892 --> 01:18:53,292
All right, Howard Hughes.
Tell me to shut up again. Get dressed.

1195
01:18:53,361 --> 01:18:54,487
Let's go.
Let's get it moving around.

1196
01:18:54,563 --> 01:18:56,087
I wanna go out.
I want you to look nice.

1197
01:18:56,164 --> 01:18:58,098
You've been shut in too long.
Let's go. Pick it up.

1198
01:19:07,943 --> 01:19:09,410
- We're with her.
- No, you're not.

1199
01:19:09,478 --> 01:19:11,412
What? Come on, man,
that's my girlfriend right there.

1200
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:12,504
Back off the rope.

1201
01:19:16,618 --> 01:19:17,607
Hey!

1202
01:19:21,690 --> 01:19:23,555
Hold the goddamn mayo.
You know that chick?

1203
01:19:23,625 --> 01:19:24,683
- Yeah. Don't point.
- Sorry.

1204
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:25,852
What's wrong?

1205
01:19:26,762 --> 01:19:28,093
We can't get in.

1206
01:19:28,163 --> 01:19:31,064
Hey, it's okay.
Come on. Let them in.

1207
01:19:36,171 --> 01:19:37,763
I love you, okay?
I really do.

1208
01:19:37,839 --> 01:19:40,137
But if you don't take
advantage of this situation...

1209
01:19:40,208 --> 01:19:42,438
...I'm gonna seriously
question your manhood.

1210
01:19:43,578 --> 01:19:44,943
I miss her.

1211
01:19:45,313 --> 01:19:46,871
Get over it, okay?

1212
01:19:46,948 --> 01:19:48,381
It's been two weeks.

1213
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:50,577
You don't think she's out here
doing the same thing?

1214
01:19:52,287 --> 01:19:54,619
I'm thinking
the pan-seared trout.

1215
01:19:55,724 --> 01:19:57,885
What about the salmon?
Looks good, too.

1216
01:19:59,194 --> 01:20:01,059
Do you think it's wild
or farm-raised?

1217
01:20:02,564 --> 01:20:05,032
- Do you like carp?
- No.

1218
01:20:11,573 --> 01:20:12,938
I wanna dance.

1219
01:20:13,275 --> 01:20:14,606
Go get to work, sister.

1220
01:20:15,076 --> 01:20:17,101
Come on, shake it
like a salt shaker. Go ahead.

1221
01:20:25,787 --> 01:20:27,254
What is that?

1222
01:20:27,956 --> 01:20:28,980
What is that? No, no.

1223
01:20:29,057 --> 01:20:32,356
That's like some Irene Cara shit.
She ought to be wearing leg warmers.

1224
01:20:32,627 --> 01:20:34,026
All right,
you gotta do damage control.

1225
01:20:34,095 --> 01:20:36,620
Yeah. This is not helping anybody.
- Go.

1226
01:20:42,103 --> 01:20:43,627
Have a drink, baby.

1227
01:20:50,478 --> 01:20:51,843
Feel better?

1228
01:20:52,681 --> 01:20:53,773
Much.

1229
01:20:56,351 --> 01:20:57,340
Yes!

1230
01:21:08,563 --> 01:21:10,428
I'm going to use
your toothbrush.

1231
01:21:10,498 --> 01:21:11,760
That's okay, right?

1232
01:21:13,235 --> 01:21:14,463
Oh, my God.

1233
01:21:15,036 --> 01:21:16,128
What?

1234
01:21:27,716 --> 01:21:28,842
Dave.

1235
01:21:29,584 --> 01:21:32,314
- Yeah.
- Do you believe in Jesus Christ?

1236
01:22:52,467 --> 01:22:53,627
You're painting.

1237
01:22:54,569 --> 01:22:55,900
I'm working.

1238
01:23:02,577 --> 01:23:04,568
I'm not doing this
to piss you off, Mom.

1239
01:23:04,646 --> 01:23:06,614
This is not
an act of rebellion.

1240
01:23:06,681 --> 01:23:08,581
I love her.
I'm trying to make it work.

1241
01:23:08,650 --> 01:23:09,674
I could really
use your help.

1242
01:23:09,751 --> 01:23:12,413
My help. Have you even
heard a word I've said?

1243
01:23:12,487 --> 01:23:13,784
I am out of this.

1244
01:23:15,223 --> 01:23:17,123
Just let me bring her over
Friday night.

1245
01:23:17,192 --> 01:23:19,092
Please. Mom,
I'm begging you.

1246
01:23:19,361 --> 01:23:20,919
She doesn't stop
talking about you.

1247
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:23,055
How much she misses you
and all this stuff.

1248
01:23:23,131 --> 01:23:24,758
Are you insane?

1249
01:23:25,667 --> 01:23:26,964
There is no way.

1250
01:23:59,367 --> 01:24:00,527
You okay?

1251
01:24:09,077 --> 01:24:10,908
Mom? We're here.

1252
01:24:14,582 --> 01:24:15,913
Rafi.

1253
01:24:22,957 --> 01:24:25,482
What?
What is it, sweetie?

1254
01:24:26,127 --> 01:24:27,617
I missed you.

1255
01:24:28,363 --> 01:24:30,092
Now I just realized
how much.

1256
01:24:34,035 --> 01:24:35,662
I missed you, too.

1257
01:24:36,171 --> 01:24:38,332
- Did you?
- Yes.

1258
01:24:38,940 --> 01:24:41,306
- Hello, sweetheart.
- Hi, Mom. Thank you.

1259
01:24:42,944 --> 01:24:44,969
- You look very nice.
- Okay.

1260
01:24:45,847 --> 01:24:47,007
Coats.

1261
01:24:48,516 --> 01:24:49,813
What? Oh, yeah.

1262
01:24:50,985 --> 01:24:53,180
- Jack.
- Ma, can Audrey come over?

1263
01:24:53,254 --> 01:24:55,814
No, no, no. Get off the phone.
Would you get off the phone?

1264
01:25:00,929 --> 01:25:03,227
All right, Dad,
this is Rafi.

1265
01:25:03,465 --> 01:25:04,727
- Hi.
- Hi.

1266
01:25:04,799 --> 01:25:06,232
- Nice to meet you.
- Very nice to meet you.

1267
01:25:06,301 --> 01:25:08,098
- This is my sister. D.
- Hi. Dinah.

1268
01:25:08,169 --> 01:25:09,796
- Hi.
- I like your dress.

1269
01:25:11,139 --> 01:25:12,731
- I heard so much about you.
- Yeah?

1270
01:25:13,074 --> 01:25:15,304
Hi, I'm Blanche.
She's my mother.

1271
01:25:15,376 --> 01:25:16,707
- And you are?
- Rafi.

1272
01:25:16,778 --> 01:25:19,042
- Rafi. What a nice name.
- Thank you.

1273
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:20,672
It's for Raphael,
actually.

1274
01:25:21,249 --> 01:25:22,614
Just like the painter.

1275
01:25:23,184 --> 01:25:25,516
- Painter?
- My husband, Sam.

1276
01:25:25,587 --> 01:25:27,418
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Hi, Sam. Nice to meet you.

1277
01:25:27,489 --> 01:25:28,581
Watch out for him.

1278
01:25:31,459 --> 01:25:32,585
That's the truth.

1279
01:25:32,660 --> 01:25:34,457
- Hope you're hungry.
- Yeah.

1280
01:25:35,463 --> 01:25:39,593
Oh, my... You shouldn't have.
Thank you.

1281
01:25:39,667 --> 01:25:42,602
Thank you very much.
What a cute bag.

1282
01:25:42,670 --> 01:25:44,900
- It's a nice bottle, too.
- Look at that.

1283
01:25:44,973 --> 01:25:47,874
If it gets cold enough,
we can drink it with dinner.

1284
01:25:47,942 --> 01:25:49,375
- Mom.
- Absolutely.

1285
01:25:49,444 --> 01:25:51,605
Put it in the freezer
for 10 minutes.

1286
01:25:52,180 --> 01:25:53,442
It'll be fine.

1287
01:25:57,218 --> 01:25:58,207
Thank you.

1288
01:25:58,286 --> 01:26:01,346
God bless my daughter. I honestly
don't know where I'd be without her.

1289
01:26:01,422 --> 01:26:03,583
In Brooklyn, Sam.
You'd be in Brooklyn.

1290
01:26:05,126 --> 01:26:06,991
This is you next to me.

1291
01:26:07,862 --> 01:26:09,955
- This is beautiful.
- You okay, Grandma?

1292
01:26:10,031 --> 01:26:12,864
Like I have a choice?
You're okay till you collapse.

1293
01:26:14,102 --> 01:26:16,002
I have to tell you
a wonderful story.

1294
01:26:16,804 --> 01:26:18,795
First time
I met my Blanche.

1295
01:26:19,274 --> 01:26:20,707
In the subway.

1296
01:26:20,775 --> 01:26:23,835
There used to be an elevated line
that ran across De Kalb Avenue.

1297
01:26:23,912 --> 01:26:25,379
I was on
one side of the car...

1298
01:26:25,446 --> 01:26:27,311
...she was on
the other side of the car.

1299
01:26:27,382 --> 01:26:30,408
And she is wearing the dopiest hat
you ever saw in your life.

1300
01:26:30,485 --> 01:26:31,747
She looked terrific.

1301
01:26:31,819 --> 01:26:33,753
I feel like I've heard
this story once before.

1302
01:26:33,821 --> 01:26:35,448
Only once?
You're lucky.

1303
01:26:38,893 --> 01:26:41,020
It's an adorable story.

1304
01:26:42,096 --> 01:26:43,120
I like this.

1305
01:26:43,198 --> 01:26:45,996
How great is it
that David sold his paintings?

1306
01:26:46,067 --> 01:26:48,900
Yes, we're so happy for him.

1307
01:26:48,970 --> 01:26:50,403
- Yeah, right.
- What?

1308
01:26:50,471 --> 01:26:52,268
I never thought
you had a chance in hell.

1309
01:26:52,340 --> 01:26:53,398
There you go.

1310
01:26:54,342 --> 01:26:57,106
Oh, Dad, really.
Anyway, you should...

1311
01:26:57,245 --> 01:26:59,304
You should all know that
this is what I'm gonna be doing...

1312
01:26:59,380 --> 01:27:00,506
...for the rest of my life.

1313
01:27:00,915 --> 01:27:02,143
Really?

1314
01:27:02,217 --> 01:27:04,412
No CPA. No law degree.

1315
01:27:05,153 --> 01:27:07,747
No, "Paging Dr. Bloomberg,"
Dad. This is it.

1316
01:27:07,822 --> 01:27:09,949
I suppose you can make
a living out of it.

1317
01:27:13,661 --> 01:27:17,097
So, I understand you're interested
in converting to Judaism.

1318
01:27:17,165 --> 01:27:19,360
Oh, my God.

1319
01:27:22,570 --> 01:27:24,538
- ood, thank you.
- Sure.

1320
01:27:27,175 --> 01:27:29,234
- Does this go in here?
- Yes.

1321
01:27:31,913 --> 01:27:33,710
Okay, good.
That's good.

1322
01:27:43,992 --> 01:27:47,553
This is very strange. Yes, it is...
- I would say, yeah.

1323
01:27:48,062 --> 01:27:52,260
Certainly never experienced
anything even remotely like it.

1324
01:27:54,569 --> 01:27:59,006
So now you've seen that
even your therapist has a crazy family.

1325
01:28:00,508 --> 01:28:03,238
Are you kidding?
This is what I never had.

1326
01:28:03,311 --> 01:28:06,906
You know, no grandparents.
No laughter around the dinner table.

1327
01:28:07,515 --> 01:28:09,176
No dinner, actually.

1328
01:28:16,891 --> 01:28:18,825
Thank you
for having me over.

1329
01:28:20,695 --> 01:28:22,856
I know this was
very difficult for you.

1330
01:28:23,131 --> 01:28:25,065
No, it wasn't difficult at all.

1331
01:28:35,443 --> 01:28:37,035
I think
you're great, Rafi.

1332
01:28:38,313 --> 01:28:39,905
I think you're great.

1333
01:28:40,648 --> 01:28:44,084
I know this is hard for you
to understand, but this isn't personal.

1334
01:28:44,652 --> 01:28:49,521
I just don't want my son
giving up on his faith so early.

1335
01:28:49,590 --> 01:28:51,080
But he wouldn't have to.

1336
01:28:51,326 --> 01:28:53,726
I would want my kids
to have a religious upbringing.

1337
01:28:53,795 --> 01:28:56,628
You know I didn't have one.
You always said I suffered from it.

1338
01:28:57,732 --> 01:28:59,359
Slow down. You...

1339
01:29:00,034 --> 01:29:02,559
Kids? With my son?

1340
01:29:03,905 --> 01:29:06,135
Rafi, think about
what you're saying.

1341
01:29:06,207 --> 01:29:07,538
I'm sorry.

1342
01:29:08,810 --> 01:29:11,404
Sometimes I forget
that you're his mother.

1343
01:29:12,947 --> 01:29:15,108
I still think of you
as my therapist.

1344
01:29:25,927 --> 01:29:27,326
What a mess, huh?

1345
01:29:29,831 --> 01:29:32,994
You know what else? He had, like
20 boxes of Q-Tips in his bathroom.

1346
01:29:33,067 --> 01:29:35,865
Meanwhile, the rest of
the place is a complete dump.

1347
01:29:37,071 --> 01:29:39,403
Wait a minute.
This is Dave you're talking about?

1348
01:29:39,874 --> 01:29:40,863
Rafi's Dave?

1349
01:29:40,942 --> 01:29:42,637
Yeah? So what?
They're broken up.

1350
01:29:42,777 --> 01:29:46,213
Listen to me, Sue.
Rafi and Dave are back together now.

1351
01:29:47,615 --> 01:29:50,049
Okay, so they're back together.
What's the big deal?

1352
01:29:50,118 --> 01:29:52,586
The big deal is,
it would kill her.

1353
01:29:52,653 --> 01:29:55,087
Okay. Jesus,
I won't say anything.

1354
01:29:56,090 --> 01:29:57,785
You won't say
anything about what?

1355
01:30:08,035 --> 01:30:09,024
Hey.

1356
01:30:16,411 --> 01:30:17,901
Did you sleep with Sue?

1357
01:30:19,881 --> 01:30:20,973
What?

1358
01:30:58,152 --> 01:30:59,176
You know what?

1359
01:30:59,253 --> 01:31:01,687
Just call her already and go back
to your own place, please.

1360
01:31:01,989 --> 01:31:04,150
I need quiet time. Thank you.

1361
01:31:04,592 --> 01:31:07,083
No, I'm not going to call her.
This is crazy.

1362
01:31:07,161 --> 01:31:08,628
She tells me
to see other people...

1363
01:31:08,696 --> 01:31:10,755
...and then she punishes me
for taking her advice?

1364
01:31:10,832 --> 01:31:12,163
Screw that.

1365
01:31:14,235 --> 01:31:18,695
You know what? Come on, even
I can see that it's not that you went out.

1366
01:31:19,073 --> 01:31:20,335
It's who
you went out with.

1367
01:31:22,243 --> 01:31:24,871
It's, like,
Learn Your Fucking Lesson Day around here.

1368
01:31:26,781 --> 01:31:28,214
Jesus Christ.

1369
01:31:39,093 --> 01:31:40,617
Lock the door, please.

1370
01:31:41,662 --> 01:31:42,822
Thank you.

1371
01:31:45,366 --> 01:31:48,460
Magnolia. Traitors.

1372
01:31:51,172 --> 01:31:55,438
<i>You have my total support
in whatever you want to do.</i>

1373
01:31:55,843 --> 01:31:58,710
<i>Then why do I feel like
you're still against this?</i>

1374
01:31:59,514 --> 01:32:03,678
<i>I'm not. I am worried.
I'm your mother.</i>

1375
01:32:03,751 --> 01:32:04,911
<i>That's my job.</i>

1376
01:32:05,152 --> 01:32:07,313
What if I decide
to go through with this?

1377
01:32:07,388 --> 01:32:11,757
Sweetheart, you clearly have
something special, you two.

1378
01:32:12,326 --> 01:32:15,784
I look at this relationship
and I think what it's done for you.

1379
01:32:16,864 --> 01:32:18,627
It's really...
It's great.

1380
01:32:20,134 --> 01:32:22,261
You are... I mean,
you've come into your own.

1381
01:32:22,336 --> 01:32:24,065
You're a painter.
I get that.

1382
01:32:24,639 --> 01:32:26,664
Rafi made me see that.

1383
01:32:28,042 --> 01:32:29,873
That is going to be your life.

1384
01:32:29,944 --> 01:32:32,742
- That's right.
- That's right. That's great.

1385
01:32:33,848 --> 01:32:37,181
But, David,
you have to try to hear this.

1386
01:32:37,885 --> 01:32:40,877
Love is not
always enough.

1387
01:32:41,389 --> 01:32:44,051
Not when you're talking about
marriage and children...

1388
01:32:44,125 --> 01:32:45,752
and joint checking accounts.

1389
01:32:45,826 --> 01:32:49,785
You're not supposed
to learn this lesson at 23, maybe...

1390
01:32:49,864 --> 01:32:53,356
...but you did get yourself
into a complicated situation.

1391
01:32:53,434 --> 01:32:54,458
Mom.

1392
01:32:57,305 --> 01:32:59,398
Relationships are work.

1393
01:32:59,473 --> 01:33:00,872
Children...

1394
01:33:01,909 --> 01:33:03,399
...are work.

1395
01:33:03,878 --> 01:33:07,211
And I'm not saying
love isn't important. It is, but...

1396
01:33:09,116 --> 01:33:12,279
- So what are you saying?
- I'm saying that...

1397
01:33:17,758 --> 01:33:20,989
Sometimes
you love and you learn.

1398
01:33:21,796 --> 01:33:23,320
And you...

1399
01:33:25,032 --> 01:33:26,294
...move on.

1400
01:33:28,703 --> 01:33:29,965
And that's okay.

1401
01:33:57,832 --> 01:33:59,163
Here we go.

1402
01:34:28,195 --> 01:34:29,184
Whoops.

1403
01:34:34,035 --> 01:34:35,400
I'm sorry.

1404
01:34:40,207 --> 01:34:41,265
And?

1405
01:34:41,509 --> 01:34:43,409
And it was a really...

1406
01:34:44,078 --> 01:34:46,774
...really bad call
and I wasn't thinking.

1407
01:34:47,248 --> 01:34:49,546
I'm so sorry, Rafi.
I'm just...

1408
01:34:49,950 --> 01:34:53,943
...learning this stuff as I go along,
but you gotta work with me here...

1409
01:34:54,021 --> 01:34:55,420
because...

1410
01:34:56,724 --> 01:34:58,191
Can we get a minute here?

1411
01:34:58,259 --> 01:34:59,783
No way.
I work here.

1412
01:35:00,795 --> 01:35:02,592
Fine. I'm going anyway.
Look.

1413
01:35:03,264 --> 01:35:06,495
Rafi, we might have
some things working against us...

1414
01:35:06,567 --> 01:35:10,401
...and I do screw up from time to time,
but so does everybody else.

1415
01:35:11,205 --> 01:35:13,366
The difference with me is
I am actively...

1416
01:35:13,441 --> 01:35:15,432
...I'm trying so hard
to get it right.

1417
01:35:16,010 --> 01:35:18,672
And I wanna be the man
that you see in me every so often.

1418
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:22,477
Okay, on leap years, fine.
But I wanna be that guy for you.

1419
01:35:23,718 --> 01:35:25,345
Bottom line is...

1420
01:35:26,220 --> 01:35:28,085
...I love you so much.

1421
01:35:32,093 --> 01:35:34,084
I'll figure it out, okay?

1422
01:35:35,296 --> 01:35:38,288
I'll get it. You just gotta
give me a chance.

1423
01:35:59,253 --> 01:36:01,778
- Are you sure about this?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

1424
01:36:01,856 --> 01:36:03,084
Why now?

1425
01:36:04,592 --> 01:36:06,651
'Cause you want this
more than anything in the world.

1426
01:36:07,161 --> 01:36:08,651
And I wanna
give it to you.

1427
01:36:10,564 --> 01:36:12,054
I wanna make
a baby with you.

1428
01:36:14,301 --> 01:36:15,529
I can't.

1429
01:36:18,239 --> 01:36:19,297
Why?

1430
01:36:21,142 --> 01:36:23,975
Because I love you
and I can't do this to you.

1431
01:36:24,311 --> 01:36:26,541
I don't understand.
What are you doing to me?

1432
01:36:27,581 --> 01:36:29,481
It actually feels really good.

1433
01:36:33,020 --> 01:36:34,180
I just can't.

1434
01:36:36,891 --> 01:36:38,381
I wanna give this to you.

1435
01:36:44,398 --> 01:36:45,888
I know you do.

1436
01:36:46,534 --> 01:36:49,298
And it's the sweetest gift
anyone's ever given me.

1437
01:36:51,272 --> 01:36:52,762
But it's not right for you.

1438
01:36:54,141 --> 01:36:55,574
You'll regret it.

1439
01:36:56,877 --> 01:36:58,174
You know this.

1440
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:01,707
The fact that
you're still willing...

1441
01:37:01,782 --> 01:37:04,376
...just shows how deep
your love goes.

1442
01:37:08,289 --> 01:37:10,416
That's the gift
I'm taking from you.

1443
01:38:06,981 --> 01:38:08,778
I think I only need to sell
one more painting...

1444
01:38:08,849 --> 01:38:10,316
...then I'll have enough
to get out of here.

1445
01:38:10,384 --> 01:38:12,079
What?
Where you gonna go?

1446
01:38:12,686 --> 01:38:16,122
I was thinking about somewhere in
Central America. Maybe El Salvador.

1447
01:38:16,357 --> 01:38:18,621
You're just gonna pick up
and go to El Salvador?

1448
01:38:19,593 --> 01:38:20,992
- Yeah.
- I don't understand.

1449
01:38:21,061 --> 01:38:23,928
You get there, you get off the plane.
How do you know where to go?

1450
01:38:24,231 --> 01:38:25,960
I don't.
I'm going to figure it out.

1451
01:38:26,033 --> 01:38:27,762
It's time for me
to try something like this.

1452
01:38:27,835 --> 01:38:29,359
I've never even left
the country before.

1453
01:38:29,436 --> 01:38:31,267
Excuse me.
What about Class Trip '98?

1454
01:38:31,705 --> 01:38:33,297
- What, Niagara Falls?
- Yeah.

1455
01:38:33,374 --> 01:38:35,205
- Come on, Morris.
- What?

1456
01:38:36,043 --> 01:38:38,637
- Well, man,what am I gonna do?
- You should come with me.

1457
01:38:38,712 --> 01:38:40,577
- No. El Salvador?
- Yeah.

1458
01:38:40,648 --> 01:38:42,878
<i>That's Noriega country, amigo.
I'm gonna pass on that.</i>

1459
01:38:42,950 --> 01:38:45,009
No, that's Panama,
and you might learn something.

1460
01:38:45,352 --> 01:38:46,876
I'm learning right here.

1461
01:38:46,954 --> 01:38:49,081
I went on a second date
with this girl the other night.

1462
01:38:49,356 --> 01:38:50,345
You're kidding me.

1463
01:38:50,424 --> 01:38:52,984
Yes, I am. But I had you
for a second, didn't I? I had you.

1464
01:38:53,060 --> 01:38:54,425
- Oh, shit.
- What?

1465
01:38:55,262 --> 01:38:57,560
- I forgot my hat at the restaurant.
- Oh, you schmuck.

1466
01:38:57,898 --> 01:38:59,991
- You want me to come with you?
- No, that's cool, I'll get it.

1467
01:39:00,067 --> 01:39:01,125
- All right, man.
- I love you, brother.

1468
01:39:01,201 --> 01:39:02,600
- 'll catch up with you.
- All right, man.

1469
01:39:21,388 --> 01:39:23,686
- You forgot your hat.
- Yeah.

1470
01:39:28,228 --> 01:39:29,627
- There you go.
- Thank you.
