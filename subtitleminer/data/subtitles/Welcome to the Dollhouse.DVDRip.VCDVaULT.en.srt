1
00:02:52,346 --> 00:02:54,371
Can I sit here?

2
00:02:59,954 --> 00:03:01,922
If you feel like it.

3
00:03:10,465 --> 00:03:12,729
Someone barfed there
fourth period.

4
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:37,958
Hi, Dawn.
Sorry to bother you.

5
00:03:38,025 --> 00:03:40,425
But we were just wondering,
are you a lesbian?

6
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,467
- Well, are you?
- No.

7
00:03:48,536 --> 00:03:51,972
Liar.
She made a pass at me.

8
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:57,142
Lesbo, lesbo, lesbo

9
00:03:57,945 --> 00:04:00,846
Lesbo, lesbo

10
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:15,153
Fag! You're a faggot!
Aren't you?

11
00:04:15,229 --> 00:04:18,790
"I'm a faggot."
Admit it. Say it.

12
00:04:20,067 --> 00:04:22,001
You look beautiful
in this suit, Troy.

13
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:24,799
- Look, get over here.
- Where the hell you going?

14
00:04:24,872 --> 00:04:28,205
You fuckin' faggot. You're a faggot,
aren't you, Troy-boy?

15
00:04:28,276 --> 00:04:29,834
Aren't you?

16
00:04:29,911 --> 00:04:33,312
Admit it. Say, "I'm a faggot."
Say it.

17
00:04:33,381 --> 00:04:36,145
- Say it, faggot. Say it!
- Say it.

18
00:04:36,217 --> 00:04:38,515
- I'm a faggot.
- Why don't you leave him alone?

19
00:04:38,586 --> 00:04:41,214
Hey, guys, watch out.
It's the Wienerdog!

20
00:04:41,289 --> 00:04:43,086
It's dogface.

21
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:45,057
You guys are such jerks.

22
00:04:45,126 --> 00:04:49,153
What's the matter, ugly?
You like faggots?

23
00:04:51,766 --> 00:04:54,234
Let's get out of here.
Her face is killing me.

24
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,295
Are you all right,
Troy?

25
00:04:59,373 --> 00:05:01,534
Leave me alone,
Wienerdog.

26
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,568
Hey, that didn't sound
too much like "Satisfaction."

27
00:05:35,643 --> 00:05:37,975
- Yeah, what's the matter, do you think?
- I don't know.

28
00:05:38,045 --> 00:05:40,843
It says B-flat.
I'm just playing what it says.

29
00:05:40,915 --> 00:05:42,940
Play me an "A."

30
00:05:46,821 --> 00:05:49,085
- This is bad.
- Yeah, we sound like shit.

31
00:05:49,156 --> 00:05:53,616
- I knew this band was gonna suck.
- What does "suck" mean?

32
00:05:53,694 --> 00:05:55,821
Missy, go play with Dawn.

33
00:05:57,999 --> 00:06:00,559
We've just got to practice more.
Hell, it's our first time.

34
00:06:00,635 --> 00:06:03,570
What do you think the Stones sounded
like the first time they practiced?

35
00:06:03,638 --> 00:06:05,196
Yeah.

36
00:06:05,273 --> 00:06:08,834
I'm gonna close the garage door
so we can get some privacy.

37
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,504
Let's take it from the top.

38
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:14,946
A one and a two
and a one, two, three, four!

39
00:06:22,857 --> 00:06:26,122
Toss-up question:
Spell the word "satellite. "

40
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:31,755
S-a-t-e-l-l-i-t-e.

41
00:06:31,832 --> 00:06:33,595
Correct. 20 points.

42
00:06:33,668 --> 00:06:35,761
You're not supposed to drink
in the TV room.

43
00:06:35,836 --> 00:06:39,328
- Drop dead, lesbo.
- Riverdale has 200.

44
00:06:39,407 --> 00:06:43,571
- London is located along which river?
- Mommy, Dawn called me "Iesbo."

45
00:06:43,644 --> 00:06:45,874
- Hold on, Rita.
- The Thames.

46
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,744
Oh, Dawn!

47
00:06:48,849 --> 00:06:51,784
Dawn, I want to speak
to you right now.

48
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,649
Stupid.

49
00:06:56,157 --> 00:06:57,886
Tattletale.

50
00:06:59,827 --> 00:07:02,921
- What did you call your sister?
- She was bothering me!

51
00:07:02,997 --> 00:07:06,865
I don't care what she was doing.
Now are you going to apologize?

52
00:07:06,934 --> 00:07:10,370
- Apologize or you're punished.
- But Mom, she was bothering me!

53
00:07:10,438 --> 00:07:13,532
- That's it! Go to your room!
- She's such a little brat!

54
00:07:13,607 --> 00:07:15,541
I don't want to hear it!
Go!

55
00:07:18,446 --> 00:07:22,212
- American Revolution.
- That's correct. You got all 40 points.

56
00:07:22,283 --> 00:07:24,080
Toss-up:
What organism is--

57
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:32,191
I love her little profile.
Let's go to the phones.

58
00:07:36,931 --> 00:07:41,698
- Hi, Missy. Is Dawn home?
- She can't play. She's punished.

59
00:08:36,123 --> 00:08:38,648
- Mrs. Grissom?
- Yes, Dawn?

60
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:42,594
- Brandon's trying to copy my answers.
- You lie!

61
00:08:42,663 --> 00:08:44,722
You were too,
and you know it!

62
00:08:45,933 --> 00:08:47,525
Quiet!

63
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:52,430
Dawn, Brandon,
you can see me here at 3:00.

64
00:08:52,506 --> 00:08:55,304
I'm giving you both detention.

65
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,147
Oh, hi.

66
00:09:17,031 --> 00:09:19,329
You didn't come in here
to wash your hands.

67
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,300
Y-Yes, I did.

68
00:09:21,368 --> 00:09:23,802
You came in here
to take a shit.

69
00:09:23,871 --> 00:09:26,931
N-No. Really.
I don't have to go.

70
00:09:27,007 --> 00:09:29,976
- My hands were dirty, that's all.
- Liar.

71
00:09:30,044 --> 00:09:33,013
I can smell you from here.

72
00:09:34,582 --> 00:09:36,482
- Please let me go.
- First...

73
00:09:37,885 --> 00:09:39,352
take a shit.

74
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:45,320
- But I'll be late for Science.
- Well, you're not leaving until you do.

75
00:09:45,392 --> 00:09:50,159
You know, Lolita, me and my neighbor
are starting this new club.

76
00:09:50,231 --> 00:09:53,359
And if you want,
you can be vice president.

77
00:09:54,001 --> 00:09:56,492
Fuck you.

78
00:09:56,570 --> 00:10:00,370
And I really wasn't the one
who was cheating. I'm innocent.

79
00:10:00,441 --> 00:10:04,502
I know.
You're always innocent.

80
00:10:04,578 --> 00:10:08,275
- And Brandon's always guilty.
- But Brandon was--

81
00:10:08,349 --> 00:10:11,841
You stay away from Brandon.
He's mine.

82
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:14,387
- Got it?
- Of course, but--

83
00:10:14,455 --> 00:10:15,922
But shit.

84
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,424
Now, go on.

85
00:10:22,396 --> 00:10:26,127
Leave it.
I want to make sure you shit.

86
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,260
I want to see it
with my own eyes.

87
00:10:29,336 --> 00:10:31,201
Why do you hate me?

88
00:10:31,272 --> 00:10:33,866
Because you're ugly.

89
00:11:34,034 --> 00:11:37,595
M-Mrs. Grissom,
I'm finished.

90
00:11:37,671 --> 00:11:39,969
Let me see.

91
00:12:03,063 --> 00:12:06,464
Mrs. Grissom,
can I take a retest?

92
00:12:06,533 --> 00:12:10,230
But I know I could have done better
if none of this had happened.

93
00:12:10,304 --> 00:12:13,296
- I was nervous.
- I said no, Dawn !

94
00:12:13,374 --> 00:12:18,038
But Mrs. Grissom, I really wasn't
the one who was cheating...

95
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:21,343
and if I could just
redo this test--

96
00:12:21,415 --> 00:12:23,576
Just once.
Please?

97
00:12:25,552 --> 00:12:29,249
- I'm better than a D-minus.
- Stop grade grubbing!

98
00:12:29,323 --> 00:12:32,053
Don't you have any dignity?

99
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,354
Now...

100
00:12:33,427 --> 00:12:36,396
I want you to write
a 100-word essay...

101
00:12:36,463 --> 00:12:41,059
on the subject of dignity
and hand it in to me by Friday.

102
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:43,797
You're excused.

103
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,254
She's got it so easy.

104
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,629
She'll always have it easy.

105
00:13:15,369 --> 00:13:17,735
Maybe she'll die.

106
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,002
You don't know
what it's like.

107
00:13:22,076 --> 00:13:25,068
- What?
- Junior high.

108
00:13:26,814 --> 00:13:30,978
-Do you think anyone will join our club?
-I don't want anyone to join.

109
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,184
I want to be popular.

110
00:13:38,726 --> 00:13:42,218
So I think I may have swung a pretty
good deal with Steve Rodgers today.

111
00:13:42,296 --> 00:13:44,958
- I think we got him.
- Who's Steve Rodgers?

112
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:49,196
Steve Rodgers is only
one of the most popular guys in class.

113
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:51,965
We get him, we'll get invited
to play everywhere:

114
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:56,373
sweet sixteens, school dances,
maybe even a gig on the road.

115
00:13:56,443 --> 00:13:58,934
- What does he play?
- Guitar, a little.

116
00:13:59,012 --> 00:14:02,448
But mainly, he sings.
But that's not the point.

117
00:14:02,516 --> 00:14:06,850
The point is, it's just exactly
what I needed for my college resume.

118
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:10,856
With this kind of extracurricular
activity, I'm gonna have it made.

119
00:14:10,924 --> 00:14:13,916
Maybe not the Big Three,
but an lvy at least.

120
00:14:13,994 --> 00:14:16,121
Well, we'll have to see
about those SATs.

121
00:14:16,196 --> 00:14:19,029
Mommy, could I join Mark's band?

122
00:14:19,099 --> 00:14:21,761
- Oh, sweetheart.
- I'm serious.

123
00:14:21,835 --> 00:14:24,235
And I think you should
send Dawn to a reformatory.

124
00:14:24,304 --> 00:14:27,137
She's always bothering me.

125
00:14:27,207 --> 00:14:30,802
Honey, you don't mean that.
Dawn loves you.

126
00:14:30,878 --> 00:14:35,247
No matter what she does,
she's your sister.

127
00:14:35,315 --> 00:14:39,718
Dawn, tell Missy that you're sorry
for bothering her and that you love her.

128
00:14:45,492 --> 00:14:48,825
- I'm not sorry.
- Stop acting like a baby.

129
00:14:48,896 --> 00:14:51,729
You're her older sister,
and Missy loves you.

130
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:55,166
- She does not.
- She does. Tell her you love her.

131
00:14:55,235 --> 00:14:57,465
- I love you.
- You do not!

132
00:14:57,538 --> 00:14:59,506
- I do too.
- You do not!

133
00:14:59,573 --> 00:15:03,703
You are not leaving this table until
you tell your sister that you love her!

134
00:15:22,696 --> 00:15:24,630
Go to bed.

135
00:15:32,406 --> 00:15:35,341
...this stupid doll.

136
00:15:45,085 --> 00:15:49,522
Sweet candy from a baby

137
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:54,186
I know you're Daddy's girl
but it don't worry me

138
00:15:54,261 --> 00:15:58,288
Won't you give me
some sweet candy

139
00:16:01,935 --> 00:16:03,869
Well, Dawn is very musical.

140
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:10,405
Yeah. No, I know.
No, she's going.

141
00:16:10,477 --> 00:16:14,038
I told her
she'll have a fabulous time.

142
00:16:14,114 --> 00:16:16,105
What kid doesn't want
to go to Disney World?

143
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:19,448
Right.

144
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:23,718
- Yes.
- Let's get a little wild

145
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:28,352
Let's get a little crazy

146
00:16:28,428 --> 00:16:32,990
Well, bump it up, sugar
Let me in

147
00:16:36,403 --> 00:16:40,601
You see, I know
you're Mama 's pearl

148
00:16:40,674 --> 00:16:44,940
You're a pearl
from the ocean of tears

149
00:16:45,012 --> 00:16:49,813
I'm gonna steal that pearl
when she don't see

150
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:54,445
Won't you give me some
sweet candy

151
00:17:19,446 --> 00:17:23,473
Gonna take candy
from a baby

152
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:27,919
Sweet candy from a baby

153
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:37,230
"Dignity.

154
00:17:37,297 --> 00:17:40,789
Dignity is an important quality
everyone should have.

155
00:17:40,867 --> 00:17:44,928
- Louder.
- That way, you will never grade grub.

156
00:17:45,005 --> 00:17:50,102
- Grade grubbing is bad...
- I said, "Louder"!

157
00:17:50,177 --> 00:17:54,273
because it means you're asking
for a grade you shouldn't get.

158
00:17:54,348 --> 00:17:58,114
Because if you got it, it wouldn't be
fair to everyone who didn't grade grub.

159
00:17:58,185 --> 00:18:00,244
We can't hear you!

160
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,050
It doesn't matter whether
you're a girl or a boy...

161
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:08,857
man or a child,
rich or poor, fat or thin.

162
00:18:08,929 --> 00:18:13,389
You should never be
a grade grubber.

163
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:17,528
Therefore, dignity is a good quality
everyone should have."

164
00:18:25,345 --> 00:18:26,710
Thank you.

165
00:18:28,882 --> 00:18:31,350
I am here
to talk to you today...

166
00:18:31,418 --> 00:18:35,445
about the dangers
of talking to strangers.

167
00:18:35,522 --> 00:18:38,082
For l, Mary Ellen Moriarty...

168
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:40,126
once talked to strangers...

169
00:18:41,194 --> 00:18:45,688
and that is how I became the innocent
victim of a brutal kidnapping.

170
00:18:46,433 --> 00:18:50,267
Almost one year ago,
I was a carefree teenager...

171
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:54,933
memorizing my lines for Hello, Dolly--
I was supposed to play Dolly--

172
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:57,101
when one day...

173
00:18:57,177 --> 00:19:00,669
a day that I will
never forget--

174
00:19:00,747 --> 00:19:02,772
I was walking home
from rehearsal.

175
00:19:02,849 --> 00:19:04,783
I'd missed my car pool.

176
00:19:05,852 --> 00:19:09,253
And I was waiting at the street corner
for the light to change.

177
00:19:10,891 --> 00:19:15,624
All of a sudden a dark car
pulled up beside me...

178
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:20,395
and a big man
stepped out.

179
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:22,899
He was older...

180
00:19:23,737 --> 00:19:25,762
and good looking.

181
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:26,897
And, um--

182
00:19:28,642 --> 00:19:31,110
And he had a tattoo
on his chest.

183
00:19:31,878 --> 00:19:34,642
And then the next thing
I know, he, um--

184
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:39,208
Students, I'm telling you
this story--

185
00:19:41,822 --> 00:19:45,258
Now what exactly
did you do, Dawn?

186
00:19:51,865 --> 00:19:55,801
- I shot a spitball.
- Speak up. I can't hear you.

187
00:19:55,869 --> 00:19:57,837
I shot a spitball.

188
00:19:57,904 --> 00:20:00,236
- You shot a what?
- She shot a spitball.

189
00:20:00,307 --> 00:20:03,435
- A teacher was almost blinded.
- I was fighting back.

190
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:05,808
Whoever told you
to fight back?

191
00:20:08,381 --> 00:20:11,612
Dawn, are you having
social problems?

192
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:14,447
Yes. She's got no friends.

193
00:20:14,521 --> 00:20:16,580
- I've got friends.
- Who?

194
00:20:18,058 --> 00:20:19,355
Ralphy.

195
00:20:21,027 --> 00:20:24,087
Case closed.
She's a loner.

196
00:20:25,732 --> 00:20:30,101
Dawn, let me put it to you straight.
We're not here to get you.

197
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:34,368
But you've got to understand,
you're in junior high now.

198
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:38,275
This goes in the computer
on your record.

199
00:20:39,146 --> 00:20:43,515
Couple of years, this kind of incident
goes on your college transcript.

200
00:20:44,584 --> 00:20:46,518
Any questions?

201
00:21:15,115 --> 00:21:17,549
Were you playing
with my dolls?

202
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,829
How's it going?

203
00:21:41,074 --> 00:21:43,702
How come you got here
so late?

204
00:21:43,777 --> 00:21:46,541
I don't know.
Am I late?

205
00:21:46,613 --> 00:21:48,843
Well, never mind.
Come on in.

206
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:06,961
-Is that your Computer Science notebook?
-What?

207
00:22:07,033 --> 00:22:08,625
Yeah.

208
00:22:50,944 --> 00:22:54,675
- Are you Mark's sister?
- Yeah.

209
00:22:58,084 --> 00:23:00,678
- You in junior high?
- Yeah.

210
00:23:04,491 --> 00:23:07,654
- Ben Frank?
- Yeah.

211
00:23:09,162 --> 00:23:11,130
You like it?

212
00:23:14,134 --> 00:23:16,796
Yeah, Ben Frank's pretty bad.

213
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:19,634
- You went there too?
- Oh, yeah.

214
00:23:19,706 --> 00:23:22,038
- I was almost expelled.
- Really?

215
00:23:22,108 --> 00:23:23,700
Why?

216
00:23:25,812 --> 00:23:29,304
- I hated it.
- Oh, God. Me too.

217
00:23:32,385 --> 00:23:34,819
Well, don't worry.
It's only three years.

218
00:23:39,526 --> 00:23:40,788
Steve--

219
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:43,255
Out.

220
00:23:47,934 --> 00:23:50,664
So did you get started
on the chapter?

221
00:23:50,737 --> 00:23:53,297
It's real important to
focus on it if you want--

222
00:24:04,951 --> 00:24:08,614
"Dear Mark, I thought long and hard...

223
00:24:08,688 --> 00:24:12,385
over what we discussed at camp
and talked about it with my mother.

224
00:24:12,459 --> 00:24:16,122
She agrees with me: Sex is
an important thing to experiment with...

225
00:24:16,196 --> 00:24:20,758
before marriage, but only if there is
a serious commitment on both ends.

226
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:23,268
This is my third letter
to you, and I'm going to assume...

227
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:25,702
that you do not want
to continue our relationship...

228
00:24:25,772 --> 00:24:29,469
if I do not hear back
from you within ten days.

229
00:24:29,542 --> 00:24:33,000
Sincerely,
Your (ex-?) girlfriend...

230
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:35,445
Naomi Hayes-Blatt.

231
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:38,916
P.S. I'm getting hooked up
to E-mail for my birthday.

232
00:24:38,985 --> 00:24:42,614
I'll let you know my address
as soon as it happens. "

233
00:24:45,625 --> 00:24:46,956
Yeah?

234
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:50,394
- What are you doing?
- Computer Science.

235
00:24:56,169 --> 00:24:58,603
Is Steve good
at Computer Science?

236
00:24:59,806 --> 00:25:03,037
He's fair. He's definitely
in the bottom quarter of the class...

237
00:25:03,109 --> 00:25:04,974
but he doesn't fail.

238
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:07,707
- Why do you think that is?
- Simple:

239
00:25:07,781 --> 00:25:10,545
Because he's lazy.
All he thinks about is girls.

240
00:25:14,921 --> 00:25:17,481
Do you think about girls?

241
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:20,720
Are you kidding?
I want to get into a good school.

242
00:25:20,794 --> 00:25:23,456
My future's, like, important.

243
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:26,590
Besides, none of the girls at school
are that pretty anyway.

244
00:25:26,666 --> 00:25:28,725
What about Maria Esposito?

245
00:25:30,003 --> 00:25:31,470
Gross.

246
00:25:32,305 --> 00:25:36,298
- Steve went out with her once.
- Yeah, well, Steve is horny.

247
00:25:37,143 --> 00:25:38,770
Really?

248
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:45,415
- How horny?
- He'd go out with anyone...

249
00:25:45,485 --> 00:25:47,646
as long as it was a girl
and willing.

250
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,154
Willing to do what exactly?

251
00:25:50,223 --> 00:25:52,088
Go all the way.

252
00:25:53,226 --> 00:25:55,660
You mean, have intercourse?

253
00:25:55,728 --> 00:25:57,662
Duh !

254
00:26:00,333 --> 00:26:02,801
Why? Are you in love
with him or something?

255
00:26:04,838 --> 00:26:09,298
But, Mark, when you say
he'd go out with any girl...

256
00:26:09,375 --> 00:26:11,809
as long as they're willing
to go all the way...

257
00:26:11,878 --> 00:26:14,312
does that mean they
have to also be pretty?

258
00:26:16,583 --> 00:26:19,051
You know Tammy Steinfeld,
from car pool?

259
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:22,350
- Yeah.
- Do you think she's pretty?

260
00:26:23,089 --> 00:26:24,681
Not that pretty really.

261
00:26:24,757 --> 00:26:27,783
Dawn, she's a dog,
and he did it with her.

262
00:26:27,861 --> 00:26:31,319
Has he ever done it with anyone
younger than high school?

263
00:26:31,397 --> 00:26:34,958
- You know Ginger Friedman?
- She used to be in my gym class.

264
00:26:35,034 --> 00:26:38,231
Well, why not
ask her about Steve?

265
00:26:48,047 --> 00:26:50,641
Be back in a second.
Don't move.

266
00:27:10,069 --> 00:27:14,096
um, Ginger?
Can I talk to you for a second?

267
00:27:14,741 --> 00:27:17,266
It's about Steve Rodgers.

268
00:27:19,312 --> 00:27:21,940
We gotta talk.

269
00:27:30,156 --> 00:27:33,853
So what do you know about me and Steve?
First, tell me who told you I knew him.

270
00:27:33,927 --> 00:27:37,055
- My brother.
- Who's your brother?

271
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:39,963
- Mark Wiener.
- Him? He's king of the nerds.

272
00:27:40,667 --> 00:27:44,603
I know, but he told me you used
to go out with Steve. Is it true?

273
00:27:44,671 --> 00:27:46,935
We fingerfucked.
Once, last spring.

274
00:27:47,006 --> 00:27:49,304
That's it.
It's all over now.

275
00:27:49,375 --> 00:27:51,240
What else?

276
00:27:52,979 --> 00:27:55,641
Well, I was wondering
if I might have a chance...

277
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:58,445
if he wanted
to go steady with me?

278
00:27:58,518 --> 00:28:00,110
- Not a chance.
- But--

279
00:28:00,787 --> 00:28:03,278
Sorry, Dawn, but that's
just the way it is.

280
00:28:03,356 --> 00:28:05,984
- You don't cut it.
- What if I wore something--

281
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:09,324
Dawn, look in the mirror.

282
00:28:19,305 --> 00:28:21,899
We fingerfucked.
Once, last spring.

283
00:28:21,975 --> 00:28:24,773
That's it.
It's all over now.

284
00:28:30,617 --> 00:28:34,053
- What are you doing in there?
- None of your business!

285
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:05,779
- Is Mark around?
- No. My mom took him shopping.

286
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:08,887
Shit.

287
00:29:09,489 --> 00:29:12,720
He'll be back real soon,
I'm pretty sure.

288
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:14,851
If you want, you can
come inside and wait.

289
00:29:16,929 --> 00:29:19,523
- You have anything to eat?
- Yeah. Follow me.

290
00:29:23,269 --> 00:29:25,260
You like Yodels?

291
00:29:25,338 --> 00:29:27,533
Yeah, sure.
What else you got?

292
00:29:27,607 --> 00:29:29,575
Ring Dings, Pop-Tarts,
Hawaiian Punch.

293
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:33,009
Whatever you want. We've got
some leftovers too, in the fridge.

294
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:36,879
- Yeah? Like what?
- We've got some fish sticks.

295
00:29:36,949 --> 00:29:38,883
All right.

296
00:29:41,754 --> 00:29:45,656
- I know how to make Jell-O.
- Whatever.

297
00:29:50,396 --> 00:29:52,956
You know,
I really like your music.

298
00:29:58,004 --> 00:30:01,997
I'm pouring you some Hawaiian Punch.
Is that all right?

299
00:30:02,075 --> 00:30:04,839
- Whatever.
- Here I come.

300
00:30:54,327 --> 00:30:56,261
You're not hungry?

301
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:01,198
You know,
I play the piano.

302
00:31:02,502 --> 00:31:04,231
Oh, yeah?

303
00:32:24,283 --> 00:32:26,581
Yeah,
that's pretty good.

304
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:31,956
I could have kept going,
but I sprained my finger yesterday.

305
00:32:32,024 --> 00:32:35,551
Yeah, well, you're still better
than Barry any day, that's for sure.

306
00:32:37,129 --> 00:32:40,030
- You think so?
- Oh, yeah.

307
00:32:40,099 --> 00:32:43,193
He ought to be
taking lessons from you.

308
00:32:43,269 --> 00:32:48,138
Yeah, well, I don't think I have time
to give lessons to Barry...

309
00:32:48,207 --> 00:32:52,041
but you want to see
my fingers?

310
00:32:53,446 --> 00:32:55,437
Yeah, I see 'em.

311
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:01,786
Shit.
I gotta get going.

312
00:33:02,421 --> 00:33:05,447
Please wait.
Can I play it for you one more time?

313
00:33:06,125 --> 00:33:08,184
This time with no mistakes.
Please?

314
00:33:08,261 --> 00:33:10,456
- We're home!
- We're home!

315
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:15,133
Where were you?

316
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:17,635
Getting groceries
with my mom and sister.

317
00:33:17,703 --> 00:33:20,536
- Do you know what time it is?
- Yeah.

318
00:33:20,606 --> 00:33:22,972
Do you know what time
you told me to be here?

319
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:25,636
- What?
- I've been waiting a half an hour.

320
00:33:25,711 --> 00:33:27,508
- What about the problems?
- We'll get to them now.

321
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,741
No, we won't.
I've been here--

322
00:33:34,954 --> 00:33:39,482
Hear me.
You will fall in love with me.

323
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:41,857
You will make love to me.

324
00:33:41,928 --> 00:33:45,159
You will take me away
from this place.

325
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:53,061
Love's a confusing thing

326
00:33:53,139 --> 00:33:56,404
In my suburban home

327
00:33:56,475 --> 00:33:59,672
I feel so alone

328
00:34:00,546 --> 00:34:03,242
I walk through sterile rooms

329
00:34:03,316 --> 00:34:06,581
There's voices in my head

330
00:34:06,652 --> 00:34:09,086
Or coming from the phone

331
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:17,987
I got a blow-up doll
and she looks like you

332
00:34:18,064 --> 00:34:19,998
Little girl

333
00:34:21,233 --> 00:34:24,930
Well, the two of us
have made a special world

334
00:34:25,004 --> 00:34:26,938
Little girl

335
00:34:28,374 --> 00:34:31,866
So welcome to the dollhouse

336
00:34:41,721 --> 00:34:44,656
- I got it all set up for you
- I got it all set up for you

337
00:34:58,404 --> 00:35:00,736
Hey, Steve, I think your singing was
a little flat that time.

338
00:35:02,875 --> 00:35:05,207
Barry, why don't you play
an "A" for Steve.

339
00:35:06,712 --> 00:35:09,374
You got that, Steve?

340
00:35:09,448 --> 00:35:11,814
Fuck this shit.

341
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:24,785
- What's got into him?
- He can't take criticism.

342
00:35:24,864 --> 00:35:29,164
- Great. There goes the band. Shit.
- Wait!

343
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:33,365
What do you want?

344
00:35:33,439 --> 00:35:35,839
- You can't just go.
- Why not?

345
00:35:35,908 --> 00:35:38,035
- The band needs you.
- Tough, I quit.

346
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:41,443
And you can tell your shitface brother
that I'd rather fail Computer Science...

347
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:43,880
than get any more help
from him!

348
00:36:01,667 --> 00:36:03,601
I can't believe
he just quit.

349
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:07,605
Well, he did, shitface.

350
00:36:13,312 --> 00:36:15,610
She's just lucky
she's a girl.

351
00:36:15,681 --> 00:36:17,615
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

352
00:36:26,859 --> 00:36:30,260
Do you think I'll get
into the Hummingbirds next year?

353
00:36:30,329 --> 00:36:32,490
Boys always get in.

354
00:36:33,999 --> 00:36:36,866
Do you think they'll go on a trip
to Disney World next year also?

355
00:36:36,936 --> 00:36:40,133
I don't know! Maybe. It depends.

356
00:36:40,206 --> 00:36:42,265
- On what?
- Hey, dogface.

357
00:36:42,341 --> 00:36:44,809
- Drop dead!
- Let's go.

358
00:36:44,877 --> 00:36:48,244
What's the matter, faggot?
ln a hurry to run home to Mommy?

359
00:36:48,314 --> 00:36:50,373
- Shut up.
- Make me, lesbo.

360
00:36:50,449 --> 00:36:52,644
- You think you're so cool.
- You think you're hot shit...

361
00:36:52,718 --> 00:36:54,583
but you're just cold diarrhea.

362
00:36:54,653 --> 00:36:56,985
- Ooh ! Listen to this faggot.
- Shut up.

363
00:36:57,056 --> 00:37:00,321
- Shut up, you assholes.
- Yeah, shut up.

364
00:37:00,392 --> 00:37:03,190
Man, if I were you, faggot,
I'd be shitting in my pants.

365
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:05,856
'Cause when you go to junior high, man,
I'm gonna smash...

366
00:37:05,931 --> 00:37:08,957
that little fairy face of yours
into a mushy pulp.

367
00:37:09,034 --> 00:37:11,764
At least he won't
stay back a year.

368
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:15,431
Retard.

369
00:37:32,925 --> 00:37:35,393
- Hey, Wiener.
- What do you want?

370
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:40,455
You better get ready 'cause
at 3:00 today, I'm going to rape you.

371
00:38:35,321 --> 00:38:37,812
Forget that ugly bitch.

372
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:41,625
Bug off.

373
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:44,561
You want to come over
to my house tonight?

374
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:47,121
Just get the fuck
away from me, okay?

375
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:49,724
Oh, come on.

376
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:52,629
Get the fuck off.

377
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,725
Nice try, bitch.

378
00:39:23,802 --> 00:39:27,670
- No, I was trying to meet you.
- Don't bullshit me, you ugly fuck!

379
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:30,004
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry for shit!

380
00:39:30,075 --> 00:39:33,169
- So you still think I'm a retard?
- No, you're not a retard.

381
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:35,179
Please stop.
You're hurting me.

382
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:39,941
Now strip.

383
00:39:40,019 --> 00:39:41,680
Strip.

384
00:39:51,797 --> 00:39:53,492
Bitch.

385
00:39:57,469 --> 00:40:00,165
Now, listen.
When your sister gets here, let me do...

386
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:03,367
the talking,
but back me up whatever l--

387
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:05,876
Oh, Dawn! Come join us.

388
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:08,106
We need your help.

389
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:10,808
- We're having a party.
- What for?

390
00:40:10,883 --> 00:40:13,511
Mom and Dad's 20th,
dinghead.

391
00:40:14,586 --> 00:40:16,952
I was talking with your dad,
and we thought...

392
00:40:17,022 --> 00:40:19,115
it would be a great idea
if this year...

393
00:40:19,191 --> 00:40:21,989
we celebrated our anniversary
in the backyard.

394
00:40:22,061 --> 00:40:26,020
We could set up tables,
and there'd be dancing.

395
00:40:26,098 --> 00:40:28,862
Mark's band is gonna be the music.
Your brother...

396
00:40:28,934 --> 00:40:32,199
has even promised
to write a song special for us.

397
00:40:32,271 --> 00:40:35,297
It's our 20th, you know.

398
00:40:35,374 --> 00:40:37,899
What do you think,
if we all pitch in together?

399
00:40:39,778 --> 00:40:42,372
Mom wants you to tear down
your clubhouse.

400
00:40:42,448 --> 00:40:44,746
But that's
the Special People Club!

401
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:48,514
Oh, honey, I know.

402
00:40:49,588 --> 00:40:52,352
But we really
need the space.

403
00:40:52,424 --> 00:40:55,916
And, besides, it's not
really very pretty, is it?

404
00:40:55,995 --> 00:41:00,056
And you're getting
a little old for clubhouses.

405
00:41:06,472 --> 00:41:08,406
Whom may I say is calling,
please?

406
00:41:09,475 --> 00:41:12,035
Certainly. Hold on a moment.
Dawn.

407
00:41:12,978 --> 00:41:14,912
It's for you.

408
00:41:16,782 --> 00:41:18,682
Hey, ugly.

409
00:41:20,452 --> 00:41:23,683
- Why'd you hurry off like that?
- I-l was in a rush.

410
00:41:23,756 --> 00:41:26,725
- Fuck you were. Tomorrow.
- Really, l--

411
00:41:26,792 --> 00:41:29,352
Same time, same place.

412
00:41:29,428 --> 00:41:33,558
You get raped.
Be there.

413
00:41:44,676 --> 00:41:47,270
So, who is this Brandon?

414
00:41:48,347 --> 00:41:50,679
Just this kid from school.

415
00:41:50,749 --> 00:41:52,842
Is he a nice boy?

416
00:41:52,918 --> 00:41:55,352
Yeah, he's okay.

417
00:42:19,244 --> 00:42:21,303
- You alone?
- Yeah.

418
00:42:23,315 --> 00:42:26,409
- What time do you have to be home by?
- 4:30.

419
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:31,852
Wait. I have something
I want you to do for me first.

420
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:34,154
Come on. This way.

421
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:37,657
And don't try anything stupid.

422
00:43:16,902 --> 00:43:19,268
Do you want me to lie down?

423
00:43:26,745 --> 00:43:29,475
- You want a smoke first?
- No, thanks.

424
00:43:29,548 --> 00:43:32,984
- Afraid?
- No, I just don't feel like it.

425
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:44,660
But I think marijuana
should be legalized.

426
00:43:48,634 --> 00:43:51,501
Why do you always
have to be such a cunt?

427
00:43:58,944 --> 00:44:01,538
I'm sorry.

428
00:44:01,613 --> 00:44:04,207
Brandon,
I don't mean to be a cunt.

429
00:44:05,651 --> 00:44:07,778
You know I've got a brother?

430
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:11,345
No, I never knew that.
What grade's he in?

431
00:44:11,423 --> 00:44:15,689
He's not in any grade.
He's retarded.

432
00:44:32,844 --> 00:44:34,709
I'm sorry.

433
00:44:35,781 --> 00:44:38,545
There's nothing
to be sorry about. He's a tough kid.

434
00:44:38,617 --> 00:44:40,949
He could beat you up
if he wanted.

435
00:44:44,156 --> 00:44:47,091
I'm sorry.
I mean-- Yeah.

436
00:45:02,541 --> 00:45:06,068
Brandon, are you still
going to rape me?

437
00:45:08,447 --> 00:45:10,608
What time is it?

438
00:45:10,682 --> 00:45:14,618
I don't know, but I guess
I don't have to be home yet.

439
00:45:14,686 --> 00:45:18,645
- Nah, there's not enough time.
- Thanks, Brandon.

440
00:45:18,724 --> 00:45:21,192
Yeah, but just remember:
This didn't happen.

441
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:23,592
I mean no one,
fuckin' no one--

442
00:45:23,662 --> 00:45:26,426
I won't tell anybody,
not a soul.

443
00:45:26,498 --> 00:45:30,161
'Cause if you do, I really will
rape you next time.

444
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:37,973
I have to tell you,
I'm very upset with you three.

445
00:45:38,043 --> 00:45:40,375
But, Mommy,
I didn't do anything wrong.

446
00:45:41,146 --> 00:45:44,707
I know.
Just Mark and Dawn.

447
00:45:44,783 --> 00:45:47,183
But, Mom, I already
spoke to Steve.

448
00:45:47,252 --> 00:45:49,379
- And did you apologize?
- Yes.

449
00:45:49,454 --> 00:45:52,821
I just had to promise to give him $200
for playing at your party.

450
00:45:52,891 --> 00:45:57,157
- Two hundred dollars?
- For chrissake, Harv, it's our 20th!

451
00:45:57,229 --> 00:46:00,130
He's coming by later
to go over some stuff with me.

452
00:46:00,198 --> 00:46:02,223
There's a big Computer Science test
tomorrow.

453
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:07,000
What about you, Dawn? Are you going
to tear down that mess in the backyard?

454
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:14,135
Dawn, I am talking to you.

455
00:46:17,049 --> 00:46:20,075
Dawn, listen to your mom
and forget about it.

456
00:46:21,186 --> 00:46:23,711
The clubhouse stands,
and that's final.

457
00:46:23,789 --> 00:46:27,782
Fine.
Have it your way.

458
00:46:29,628 --> 00:46:32,620
Be smart.
Make things easy on yourself.

459
00:46:38,270 --> 00:46:40,602
- Now, this I like.
- Where did you get it?

460
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:43,641
- The supermarket.
- I picked it out.

461
00:47:09,835 --> 00:47:13,134
Mom, since Dawn isn't eating hers,
can me and Mark split it?

462
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:15,537
Yeah, can we?

463
00:47:16,608 --> 00:47:18,337
Please?

464
00:47:34,326 --> 00:47:36,294
Go ahead.

465
00:47:47,439 --> 00:47:49,907
I'm gonna need your help
this weekend.

466
00:47:49,975 --> 00:47:54,105
- What do we have to do?
- Tear down that mess in the backyard.

467
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:25,132
- What do you think?
- I think--

468
00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:28,646
They're all so beautiful.

469
00:48:28,713 --> 00:48:31,079
They're from this summer.

470
00:48:31,149 --> 00:48:33,014
Who took them?

471
00:48:34,085 --> 00:48:38,044
uh, Valerie Mondello.
She's photo editor of the yearbook.

472
00:48:40,525 --> 00:48:42,720
Was she your girlfriend?

473
00:48:43,795 --> 00:48:45,922
For a few days.

474
00:48:47,265 --> 00:48:49,233
It was worth it, though,
don't you think?

475
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:50,928
Yes.

476
00:48:54,105 --> 00:48:57,074
I'm thinking of using this one
for my first album cover.

477
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:59,235
You're going to be
on a record?

478
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:03,042
It'll happen.
It's gotta happen.

479
00:49:04,282 --> 00:49:06,307
It's just
a question of time.

480
00:49:06,384 --> 00:49:08,443
You think
before graduation?

481
00:49:09,521 --> 00:49:11,489
Fuck graduation.

482
00:49:13,458 --> 00:49:16,222
- What about college?
- Fuck college.

483
00:49:16,294 --> 00:49:21,322
I'm just doing this Computer Science
shit with Mark for my parents.

484
00:49:21,399 --> 00:49:24,664
As soon as I make enough money,
I'm moving into the city.

485
00:49:25,737 --> 00:49:27,728
That's where
it's all happening.

486
00:49:30,775 --> 00:49:34,711
I found the disk.
Out.

487
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:39,450
What do you mean, "no"?
I said out.

488
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:42,544
Steve and I are talking.

489
00:49:42,621 --> 00:49:44,953
Come on, I said out.
Come on !

490
00:49:46,691 --> 00:49:49,216
- Mom!
- Leave her alone.

491
00:49:49,294 --> 00:49:51,057
This is my room.

492
00:49:51,129 --> 00:49:55,225
- So what? You're being a total fascist.
- What is it?

493
00:50:11,182 --> 00:50:14,208
Did you solve
any of the problems?

494
00:50:14,986 --> 00:50:18,422
Good morning, students.
All Hummingbird chorus members...

495
00:50:18,490 --> 00:50:20,617
going on the concert tour
to Disney World this year...

496
00:50:20,692 --> 00:50:24,788
must hand in signed permission slips
by this Friday, the latest.

497
00:50:26,031 --> 00:50:28,659
On a more worrisome note,
drugs were found...

498
00:50:28,733 --> 00:50:30,928
extinguished yesterday
in the boys' lavatory.

499
00:50:31,002 --> 00:50:36,372
Now, I want to remind you all that any
student caught using or selling drugs...

500
00:50:36,441 --> 00:50:42,277
will be immediately expelled from school
and dealt with by the police.

501
00:50:42,347 --> 00:50:45,214
There will be no exceptions.

502
00:50:45,283 --> 00:50:50,152
Drugs are illegal.
Just say no.

503
00:50:50,221 --> 00:50:52,621
Thank you
for your attention.

504
00:50:53,959 --> 00:50:56,655
- Mrs. Iannone?
- Yes, Cookie?

505
00:50:56,728 --> 00:50:59,492
- I have an announcement.
- Go ahead.

506
00:51:02,367 --> 00:51:06,428
For everyone coming to my birthday
party, remember to bring a bathing suit.

507
00:51:06,504 --> 00:51:09,029
That's all.

508
00:51:25,790 --> 00:51:29,521
- Hey, Cookie.
- What do you want?

509
00:51:29,594 --> 00:51:33,724
How come I wasn't invited?
Jed and Lance were.

510
00:51:34,532 --> 00:51:36,762
Oh, well, I really
would have, Brandon...

511
00:51:36,835 --> 00:51:39,167
but we needed an even number
of girls and boys...

512
00:51:39,237 --> 00:51:41,535
and if you were invited...

513
00:51:41,606 --> 00:51:44,166
there would be too many boys.

514
00:51:45,243 --> 00:51:49,202
Well, I got something for you.

515
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,579
- What is it?
- Open it up.

516
00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:08,158
I didn't eat my dessert
at lunch today.

517
00:52:08,233 --> 00:52:10,394
I saved it for you.

518
00:52:10,468 --> 00:52:13,096
Now can I come to
your birthday party this weekend?

519
00:52:13,171 --> 00:52:16,766
But Brandon,
this didn't even cost anything.

520
00:52:34,025 --> 00:52:36,687
- What are you looking at?
- N-Nothing.

521
00:53:33,818 --> 00:53:36,309
Sorry about your locker.

522
00:53:36,387 --> 00:53:41,222
It's okay. I mean, it's not really
mine anyway. It's the school's.

523
00:53:42,227 --> 00:53:45,128
Anyway, I hate those
stupid kinds of parties.

524
00:53:45,196 --> 00:53:47,221
They always treat you
like little kids.

525
00:53:47,298 --> 00:53:50,028
- She probably had a fucking magician.
- Yeah.

526
00:53:51,236 --> 00:53:54,262
I hate parties too.

527
00:53:54,339 --> 00:53:56,569
My parents are tearing
this down tomorrow.

528
00:53:56,641 --> 00:53:59,201
Fuck. What for?

529
00:53:59,277 --> 00:54:02,007
- Their anniversary.
- Assholes.

530
00:54:04,082 --> 00:54:06,676
- Where'd you get that cassette player?
- Ralphy gave it to me.

531
00:54:06,751 --> 00:54:08,810
- Why do you hang out with that faggot?
- Ralphy?

532
00:54:08,887 --> 00:54:11,082
- Yeah.
- Just because he's a faggot...

533
00:54:11,156 --> 00:54:13,090
doesn't mean he's an asshole.

534
00:54:14,159 --> 00:54:16,093
Yeah, maybe.

535
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:30,199
I can't be your girlfriend.

536
00:54:30,275 --> 00:54:32,106
Huh?

537
00:54:32,177 --> 00:54:35,237
I want to,
but I'm in love with someone else.

538
00:54:35,313 --> 00:54:37,713
- Who?
- You wouldn't know him.

539
00:54:37,782 --> 00:54:39,716
- What's his name?
- It's no one you know.

540
00:54:39,784 --> 00:54:41,843
- What's his name?
- He's older.

541
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:46,721
- What's his fucking name?
- Steve Rodgers. He's in high school.

542
00:54:46,791 --> 00:54:49,123
Brandon, wait!

543
00:54:50,595 --> 00:54:53,291
Where are you going?
We still have some Yodels left!

544
00:54:53,364 --> 00:54:55,355
Asshole.

545
00:55:10,348 --> 00:55:14,546
Don't feel bad, Dawn.
Brandon McCarthy's just a retard.

546
00:55:14,619 --> 00:55:16,553
Faggot!

547
00:55:26,497 --> 00:55:31,366
It was 20 years ago today

548
00:55:31,436 --> 00:55:36,703
When Harv and Marj were married

549
00:55:36,774 --> 00:55:41,768
There were three little twinkles
in their eyes

550
00:55:41,846 --> 00:55:47,751
When over the threshold
Marj was carried

551
00:55:50,088 --> 00:55:52,556
Harv and Marj
you're the greatest

552
00:55:52,624 --> 00:55:56,993
You're the greatest couple
the world has ever seen

553
00:55:57,061 --> 00:55:59,791
We love you both
We wish you the best

554
00:55:59,864 --> 00:56:02,492
Happy anniversary
great joy and happiness

555
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:05,934
Happy anniversary

556
00:56:06,004 --> 00:56:08,996
Happy anniversary to you

557
00:56:09,073 --> 00:56:12,304
Happy anniversary

558
00:56:12,377 --> 00:56:15,107
Happy anniversary to you

559
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:21,776
You're the king
of the breadwinners, Harv

560
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:28,450
And Marj
you're the queen of mothers

561
00:56:30,194 --> 00:56:33,493
Missy, Mark and Dawn

562
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:38,394
- Are your lucky
- Where's Dawn?

563
00:56:38,469 --> 00:56:42,769
- Son and daughters
- I don't know. Where is--

564
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:44,774
Rita, did you see Dawn?

565
00:56:44,842 --> 00:56:47,811
Happy anniversary

566
00:56:47,879 --> 00:56:50,848
Happy anniversary to you

567
00:56:50,915 --> 00:56:54,009
Happy anniversary

568
00:56:54,085 --> 00:56:58,579
Happy anniversary to you

569
00:57:10,601 --> 00:57:12,535
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

570
00:57:12,603 --> 00:57:15,163
Yeah?
Are you gonna lose your lunch?

571
00:57:28,019 --> 00:57:29,953
- Really? You think so?
- Oh, honey, would you--

572
00:57:30,021 --> 00:57:32,489
- Where's Steve?
- Hey, look who's here!

573
00:57:32,557 --> 00:57:35,390
- Where have you been?
- Leave me alone. I'm looking for Steve.

574
00:57:43,468 --> 00:57:45,493
- Where's Steve?
- I don't know. Leave me alone.

575
00:57:45,570 --> 00:57:48,266
I'm trying
to figure something out.

576
00:58:05,356 --> 00:58:08,416
- Where's Steve?
- In the garage.

577
00:58:16,768 --> 00:58:21,296
Steve! Open up!
Open up!

578
00:58:21,372 --> 00:58:24,671
- Hey, Dawn, what's up?
- I have to talk to you.

579
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:29,509
- What about?
- I was wondering if--

580
00:58:34,986 --> 00:58:38,945
Well, I've been thinking
seriously of building...

581
00:58:39,023 --> 00:58:41,355
another clubhouse,
and I wanted to know--

582
00:58:41,426 --> 00:58:44,589
Would you be interested in being
my first honorary member?

583
00:58:46,998 --> 00:58:49,466
What-What are you talking about?

584
00:58:49,534 --> 00:58:52,025
The Special People Club.

585
00:58:53,704 --> 00:58:55,103
"Special People"?

586
00:58:55,173 --> 00:58:57,198
What's the matter?

587
00:58:58,242 --> 00:59:00,176
Do you know what
"special people" means?

588
00:59:00,244 --> 00:59:02,041
What?

589
00:59:02,113 --> 00:59:06,106
"Special people" equals retarded.

590
00:59:06,184 --> 00:59:09,415
Your club is for retards.

591
00:59:22,767 --> 00:59:24,894
- Hey, Mommy, look!
- I see, honey.

592
00:59:24,969 --> 00:59:28,803
Oh, look at Missy!
Oh, God, you are so cute!

593
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:33,335
Oh, look at her dancing
with Mr. Kasdan!

594
00:59:33,411 --> 00:59:37,814
And look at me and Steve!
Steve really likes me.

595
00:59:37,882 --> 00:59:41,010
- Hey, I look pretty good there!
- You sound good too.

596
00:59:41,085 --> 00:59:44,213
Oh, Harv, we have
to get copies of this tape.

597
00:59:44,288 --> 00:59:47,086
Yeah. unfortunately,
Steve just quit the band.

598
00:59:47,158 --> 00:59:50,252
What? I just gave him $200.

599
00:59:50,328 --> 00:59:53,764
Didn't you just tell me he got an "A"
on his Computer Science final?

600
00:59:53,831 --> 00:59:56,664
It's not that.
He dropped out of school and left town.

601
00:59:56,734 --> 00:59:59,703
He wants to try making it
in New York as the next Jim Morrison.

602
00:59:59,770 --> 01:00:03,035
- Stupid idiot kid. He'll never make it.
- That's what I told him.

603
01:00:03,107 --> 01:00:05,905
-He'll never get into a good school now.
-No, he won't make it.

604
01:00:05,977 --> 01:00:07,342
- Never make it.
- Never.

605
01:00:13,784 --> 01:00:16,947
Mommy, let's watch it again!

606
01:01:40,638 --> 01:01:42,572
You're so lucky.

607
01:03:06,691 --> 01:03:09,285
Would you ask Brandon McCarthy
to step outside, please?

608
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:12,852
- Is something wrong?
- The police want to question him.

609
01:03:12,930 --> 01:03:14,864
Brandon,
come up here, please.

610
01:03:18,269 --> 01:03:19,463
Leave your test.

611
01:03:24,208 --> 01:03:26,642
Come along, Brandon.

612
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:31,571
Thank you, Martha.
Sorry for the interruption.

613
01:03:53,537 --> 01:03:56,768
I'm so glad I caught you.
Listen now, Dad just called.

614
01:03:56,841 --> 01:03:59,776
His car broke down, and I have
to pick him up at the car dealer.

615
01:03:59,844 --> 01:04:03,302
I've left a note in the kitchen
for Missy to give to Mrs. Golden...

616
01:04:03,381 --> 01:04:05,815
but in case she doesn't
see it when she gets in...

617
01:04:05,883 --> 01:04:08,477
tell her to get a ride home
from ballet with her.

618
01:04:08,552 --> 01:04:11,749
I won't be able to pick her up
like I told her I would.

619
01:04:11,822 --> 01:04:13,756
- Okay?
- Yeah.

620
01:04:13,824 --> 01:04:16,088
- Now you won't forget?
- No!

621
01:04:36,447 --> 01:04:38,540
And that means hungry for love.

622
01:04:38,616 --> 01:04:40,516
They haven't gotten enough love.

623
01:04:40,584 --> 01:04:42,779
They haven't gotten enough affection.

624
01:04:42,853 --> 01:04:46,289
They haven't gotten enough
attention from their partner...

625
01:04:46,357 --> 01:04:48,825
or from the people in their life.

626
01:04:48,893 --> 01:04:50,827
I like to think
of your relationship...

627
01:04:50,895 --> 01:04:52,829
as a living,
breathing thing.

628
01:04:52,897 --> 01:04:55,695
I have found that in my program
there are five things--

629
01:04:55,766 --> 01:04:57,791
I'll get it!

630
01:04:59,470 --> 01:05:03,031
Wiener residence.
Whom, may I ask, is calling, please?

631
01:05:04,975 --> 01:05:06,374
It's Ralphy.

632
01:05:06,444 --> 01:05:09,538
- Tell him I'm punished.
- But you're not punished.

633
01:05:09,613 --> 01:05:11,877
Well, I don't feel
like talking to him.

634
01:05:11,949 --> 01:05:15,715
But he's your friend.
So here.

635
01:05:15,786 --> 01:05:17,720
- Dawn.
- Hang it up!

636
01:05:17,788 --> 01:05:20,120
I don't want to speak
to that faggot!

637
01:05:20,191 --> 01:05:22,659
- But, Dawn--
- Hang it up!

638
01:05:22,726 --> 01:05:26,924
- But he's your friend.
- He is not! He's a spy and an asshole!

639
01:05:26,997 --> 01:05:29,261
- But, Dawn, Ralphy likes you.
- Yeah?

640
01:05:29,333 --> 01:05:32,860
Well, that's too bad, 'cause you can
tell him I hope he rots in hell!

641
01:05:32,937 --> 01:05:36,873
- Maybe you should say you're sorry.
- Fuck you!

642
01:05:43,247 --> 01:05:46,045
You know you're not supposed
to drink in the TV room.

643
01:05:48,619 --> 01:05:51,383
Oh, hey, Missy!

644
01:05:51,455 --> 01:05:53,047
What?

645
01:05:56,260 --> 01:05:57,852
Nothing.

646
01:06:20,851 --> 01:06:24,116
- Haven't seen her since 6:15.
- Long brown hair, blue eyes...

647
01:06:24,188 --> 01:06:26,122
Iast seen wearing
a pink leotard...

648
01:06:26,190 --> 01:06:29,956
pink ballet slippers
and a pink tutu.

649
01:06:30,027 --> 01:06:31,961
She has an older sister,
eleven and a half.

650
01:06:32,029 --> 01:06:33,963
She gave her the note
from her mother.

651
01:06:34,031 --> 01:06:35,965
She claims to have
given her the note.

652
01:06:36,033 --> 01:06:39,969
- Her sister says she gave her the note.
- Yeah, she claims to have.

653
01:06:43,841 --> 01:06:47,333
- This was taken last summer.
- You're not going to school today?

654
01:06:47,411 --> 01:06:51,313
- Mom's afraid I'll be kidnapped also.
- Yeah, right.

655
01:06:51,382 --> 01:06:53,316
What?

656
01:06:53,384 --> 01:06:55,318
Never mind.

657
01:07:04,161 --> 01:07:06,652
What do you think
they're looking around for?

658
01:07:06,730 --> 01:07:08,823
- Clues.
- But she's not here.

659
01:07:08,899 --> 01:07:10,491
Duh !

660
01:07:11,802 --> 01:07:14,430
Do you think
you can use that one?

661
01:07:23,948 --> 01:07:25,347
Excuse me, Sergeant.

662
01:07:27,051 --> 01:07:29,042
Do you think they'll find her?

663
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:32,646
- Are you the big sister?
- Yeah.

664
01:07:32,723 --> 01:07:36,022
- And you're the big brother?
- Yeah.

665
01:07:36,093 --> 01:07:39,460
Take whatever you need.
I just want my Missy.

666
01:07:39,530 --> 01:07:41,157
Excuse me.

667
01:07:47,204 --> 01:07:50,571
You know Dad's real sick. He's probably
gonna have to go to the hospital.

668
01:07:50,641 --> 01:07:52,973
- Why? What's wrong with him?
- The doctor's not sure...

669
01:07:53,043 --> 01:07:55,603
but Mom thinks it might be
a nervous breakdown.

670
01:07:55,679 --> 01:07:59,046
It's probably just his gallbladder.

671
01:07:59,116 --> 01:08:02,677
- I'll help, Mom.
- Thank you, Dawn. Here.

672
01:08:02,753 --> 01:08:05,347
Take that up to your father
while I talk to the sergeant.

673
01:08:05,422 --> 01:08:07,356
Sure, Mom.

674
01:08:23,340 --> 01:08:26,366
I brought you some tea.

675
01:08:26,443 --> 01:08:29,469
How are you feeling?

676
01:08:29,546 --> 01:08:32,606
Better?

677
01:08:32,683 --> 01:08:38,553
Well, don't worry, they'll find Missy.
I'm sure of it.

678
01:08:38,622 --> 01:08:42,922
And if they don't,
well, remember:

679
01:08:42,993 --> 01:08:45,894
You've still got me and Mark.

680
01:09:16,627 --> 01:09:19,824
Hello.
Want a bite?

681
01:09:22,499 --> 01:09:25,229
Tommy? Tommy!

682
01:09:26,470 --> 01:09:29,598
Go on,
get back in the kitchen.

683
01:09:29,673 --> 01:09:32,267
- Who are you?
- Dawn Wiener.

684
01:09:32,342 --> 01:09:36,244
- I'm a friend of Brandon McCarthy.
- What do you want?

685
01:09:36,313 --> 01:09:40,079
Well, I was wondering
if I could see Brandon.

686
01:09:40,150 --> 01:09:43,642
- How come you're not in school?
- My sister was kidnapped.

687
01:09:44,755 --> 01:09:47,155
My mom let me
stay home today.

688
01:09:47,224 --> 01:09:50,955
- What do you want with Brandon?
- I wanted to talk to him.

689
01:09:51,028 --> 01:09:55,692
What'd he do,
knock you up or something?

690
01:09:55,766 --> 01:09:58,701
Okay, then, go ahead.
You can go say good-bye to him.

691
01:09:58,769 --> 01:10:02,398
Go on,
up the stairs at the back.

692
01:10:02,473 --> 01:10:05,203
But you got just one hour,
then we're leaving.

693
01:10:05,275 --> 01:10:07,209
Thank you, Mr. McCarthy.

694
01:10:44,414 --> 01:10:46,644
Hi, Brandon.

695
01:10:47,951 --> 01:10:49,976
What are you doing here?

696
01:10:51,221 --> 01:10:55,658
I tried calling you, but my mom wouldn't
let me because my sister was kidnapped.

697
01:10:55,726 --> 01:10:58,422
Yeah, I heard.
So what do you want?

698
01:11:12,176 --> 01:11:15,111
I want to be your girlfriend.

699
01:11:15,179 --> 01:11:17,704
Too late.
I'm leaving.

700
01:11:18,982 --> 01:11:21,951
- Where are you going?
- None of your business.

701
01:11:22,019 --> 01:11:24,988
- Can I come along?
- No.

702
01:11:25,055 --> 01:11:30,652
- Are you gonna go back to school?
- No way, man.

703
01:11:30,727 --> 01:11:33,025
I'm not goin' to no
reformatory either.

704
01:11:33,096 --> 01:11:37,965
My dad thinks I'm goin', but he can
go to hell. I'm gettin' out of here.

705
01:11:39,570 --> 01:11:44,234
- You mean you're running away?
- Yep, to New York.

706
01:11:48,078 --> 01:11:51,309
- Does anybody know?
- No.

707
01:11:55,385 --> 01:11:57,819
Get off of me.

708
01:11:57,888 --> 01:12:00,448
I'm the one that
makes the first move.

709
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:12,232
- Now come on.
- R-R-Right now?

710
01:12:12,302 --> 01:12:14,236
Now or never.

711
01:12:14,304 --> 01:12:16,966
- But I can't now.
- Why not? What? Are you scared?

712
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:19,167
- No, but l--
- What?

713
01:12:19,243 --> 01:12:21,734
Can't you wait just a little longer?
I mean, I'm sure Mr. Edwards...

714
01:12:21,812 --> 01:12:24,838
will let you back in
if you stop dealing drugs.

715
01:12:24,915 --> 01:12:27,145
Who said I deal drugs?

716
01:12:27,217 --> 01:12:30,015
But, Brandon, everyone says--

717
01:12:32,222 --> 01:12:34,315
And you believe them all.

718
01:12:35,592 --> 01:12:38,823
You mean, you didn't?

719
01:12:39,997 --> 01:12:43,091
Asshole.
Jed's the one that deals.

720
01:12:43,166 --> 01:12:45,157
But, hey, don't feel bad.

721
01:12:45,235 --> 01:12:47,328
You're like everyone else.

722
01:12:47,404 --> 01:12:50,396
You think
I'm some lying asshole.

723
01:12:50,474 --> 01:12:54,171
And you know something, Dawn?
I don't give a fuck.

724
01:12:54,244 --> 01:12:57,304
I believe you.

725
01:12:57,381 --> 01:12:59,815
Gee, thanks.
I feel so much better.

726
01:12:59,883 --> 01:13:02,113
- But I really do!
- The fuck you do!

727
01:13:02,185 --> 01:13:04,119
Brandon, I do!

728
01:13:05,689 --> 01:13:08,487
- Lying piece of shit.
- Brandon, please wait.

729
01:13:08,558 --> 01:13:11,459
- I'm so sorry.
- Well, it's too late.

730
01:13:11,528 --> 01:13:15,123
I'm gettin' outta here. Who knows?
Maybe I will deal drugs now.

731
01:13:15,198 --> 01:13:18,361
You packed?
We're leaving in ten minutes!

732
01:13:21,672 --> 01:13:23,606
Well, you comin'?

733
01:13:26,810 --> 01:13:28,277
I can't.

734
01:13:30,414 --> 01:13:32,780
Brandon, wait!
Please don't go!

735
01:14:19,763 --> 01:14:21,697
So, how's Dad?

736
01:14:24,568 --> 01:14:26,729
They don't know yet.

737
01:14:26,803 --> 01:14:29,499
They're still
doing more testing.

738
01:14:29,573 --> 01:14:31,507
Can I visit him?

739
01:14:34,611 --> 01:14:37,671
What are you doing
tomorrow after school?

740
01:14:37,748 --> 01:14:41,081
Tomorrow's no good.
I've got a big Forensic Society debate.

741
01:14:41,151 --> 01:14:44,917
But I'm sure
I can get out of it.

742
01:14:44,988 --> 01:14:47,149
No, Mark.

743
01:14:47,224 --> 01:14:51,422
Go. I want you to.
It's important.

744
01:14:53,430 --> 01:14:56,422
Dawn can come with me
to the hospital...

745
01:14:56,500 --> 01:15:00,368
and I'll get your Aunt Phyllis
to stay by the phone.

746
01:15:02,139 --> 01:15:04,801
Hello? Yes.

747
01:15:11,448 --> 01:15:13,678
Oh.

748
01:15:13,750 --> 01:15:16,947
In Times Square?

749
01:15:18,388 --> 01:15:20,322
Are you sure?

750
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:25,592
Yes.

751
01:15:25,662 --> 01:15:27,596
Thank you.

752
01:15:32,602 --> 01:15:34,536
They found her tutu.

753
01:16:48,912 --> 01:16:51,881
Excuse me.
Have you seen my sister?

754
01:16:55,685 --> 01:16:59,314
Pardon me. Have you seen my sister?
Her name is Missy Wiener.

755
01:17:08,498 --> 01:17:12,366
Have you seen my sister?
Her name's Missy Wiener.

756
01:17:30,954 --> 01:17:33,889
Help! Dawn, help me!

757
01:17:33,957 --> 01:17:36,551
Help me!
Help me, Dawn!

758
01:17:36,626 --> 01:17:38,253
Help! Help!

759
01:17:43,066 --> 01:17:44,590
Wait! Wait!

760
01:17:44,668 --> 01:17:47,262
Stop! Stop!

761
01:17:47,337 --> 01:17:49,305
Let go of my sister!

762
01:17:59,716 --> 01:18:02,344
You're the best daughter
a mother could have!

763
01:18:02,419 --> 01:18:05,183
- I love you so much.
- I love you, Dawn.

764
01:18:05,255 --> 01:18:07,621
Me too.
I love you.

765
01:18:07,691 --> 01:18:11,183
- Oh, Dawn, I love you.
- Dawn, I love you!

766
01:18:11,261 --> 01:18:14,958
- And you know I've always loved you.
- Oh, Dawn, we love you!

767
01:18:46,763 --> 01:18:49,231
- Yeah, I'll accept.
- Hi, Mark?

768
01:18:49,299 --> 01:18:51,995
- It's Dawn.
- Ooh, are you in trouble.

769
01:18:52,068 --> 01:18:54,298
- Where are you?
- New York.

770
01:18:54,371 --> 01:18:57,135
- What are you doing there?
- I-l ran away.

771
01:18:57,207 --> 01:19:00,870
- Are you serious?
- Yeah. I thought I might find Missy.

772
01:19:00,944 --> 01:19:04,846
- Way to go.
- Is Mom real upset?

773
01:19:04,914 --> 01:19:07,747
Not really.
They found Missy this morning.

774
01:19:07,817 --> 01:19:10,411
- Is she dead?
- No, she's fine.

775
01:19:10,487 --> 01:19:12,478
It turns out Mr. Kasdan
kidnapped her.

776
01:19:12,555 --> 01:19:13,852
- Really?
- Yeah.

777
01:19:13,923 --> 01:19:16,858
Mrs. Kasdan is gonna
file for divorce now.

778
01:19:16,926 --> 01:19:18,860
Turns out he'd built this
little underground room...

779
01:19:18,928 --> 01:19:21,123
beneath the shuffleboard
court and kept her there.

780
01:19:21,197 --> 01:19:23,461
- Did he rape her?
- Nah.

781
01:19:23,533 --> 01:19:26,525
I think he videotaped her
doing some pirouettes, but that's it.

782
01:19:26,603 --> 01:19:28,730
Is she in the hospital?

783
01:19:28,805 --> 01:19:31,865
No, she's here.
She's the same.

784
01:19:31,941 --> 01:19:34,068
Actually, I think she may
have liked being there...

785
01:19:34,144 --> 01:19:37,602
'cause she had her own TV
and total control over the pusher.

786
01:19:37,681 --> 01:19:41,583
She also got to have as much candy
and McDonald's as she wanted.

787
01:19:41,651 --> 01:19:43,585
Can you get Mom?

788
01:19:43,653 --> 01:19:45,587
Yeah, hold on.

789
01:19:47,824 --> 01:19:49,758
Mom, it's Dawn.

790
01:19:49,826 --> 01:19:51,885
- Will you move?
- Where the fuck is Sam?

791
01:19:51,961 --> 01:19:53,895
Can you call back
a little later?

792
01:19:53,963 --> 01:19:57,592
- She's being interviewed.
- Okay.

793
01:20:05,542 --> 01:20:08,705
And now, students,
I'd like you to give your attention...

794
01:20:08,778 --> 01:20:11,645
to Dawn Wiener.

795
01:20:24,828 --> 01:20:30,061
"I'm standing here today to express
my and my family's thanks...

796
01:20:30,133 --> 01:20:34,729
for the support in helping us get
through this hor-- terrible ordeal.

797
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:40,571
If it hadn't been for your help
in providing the police...

798
01:20:40,643 --> 01:20:45,444
with the information leading
to the conviction of Joseph Kasdan...

799
01:20:45,515 --> 01:20:49,042
my sister might not
be here today.

800
01:20:49,119 --> 01:20:51,747
Your emotional
and moral support...

801
01:20:51,821 --> 01:20:55,222
has been invaluable.

802
01:20:55,291 --> 01:20:59,455
Missy has always been like
a sister to me...

803
01:20:59,529 --> 01:21:01,156
- Wienerdog!
- and a friend.

804
01:21:02,832 --> 01:21:06,598
- And now that she is safe and sound--
- Wienerdog!

805
01:21:06,669 --> 01:21:09,365
- Wienerdog!
- Wienerdog!

806
01:21:09,439 --> 01:21:12,806
And now that she's safe and sound--

807
01:21:23,686 --> 01:21:26,120
Quiet!

808
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:32,294
Go on, Dawn.

809
01:21:39,102 --> 01:21:43,869
I can rest easy in the knowledge that,
that Missy is fine.

810
01:21:43,940 --> 01:21:46,033
Thank you very much."

811
01:21:49,045 --> 01:21:51,172
...were unavailable for comment.

812
01:21:51,247 --> 01:21:53,181
Friends and neighbors, however,
shocked at his arrest...

813
01:21:53,249 --> 01:21:55,877
described Joseph Kasdan
as a regular family man...

814
01:21:55,952 --> 01:21:58,853
who would often dress up
as Santa at Christmastime.

815
01:21:58,922 --> 01:22:01,288
Now we bring you an exclusive
interview from our own--

816
01:22:01,357 --> 01:22:03,655
While you're at it,
can you get me another bag of popcorn?

817
01:22:03,726 --> 01:22:06,593
- And a glass of diet Coke.
- And Hawaiian Punch.

818
01:22:06,663 --> 01:22:10,064
- Okay.
- Did he touch you at all in any way?

819
01:22:10,133 --> 01:22:12,067
I don't know.

820
01:22:14,003 --> 01:22:17,700
Anyway, I bet you're happy
to be home with Mommy.

821
01:22:17,774 --> 01:22:19,708
Yes.

822
01:22:24,447 --> 01:22:27,905
Tell me, Mrs. Wiener, how did
you feel when you discovered--

823
01:22:30,353 --> 01:22:35,154
Mark, is eighth grade
better than seventh?

824
01:22:35,225 --> 01:22:37,716
Not really.

825
01:22:37,794 --> 01:22:39,728
What about ninth?

826
01:22:41,297 --> 01:22:43,322
All of junior high school sucks.

827
01:22:43,399 --> 01:22:47,893
High school's better. It's closer
to college. They'll call you names...

828
01:22:47,971 --> 01:22:50,701
but not as much to your face.

829
01:22:54,911 --> 01:22:58,711
How did you feel being kidnapped
and being held hostage?

830
01:22:58,781 --> 01:23:01,750
- Were you scared?
- No.

831
01:23:01,818 --> 01:23:06,312
- I don't want to go to Disney World.
- Don't be stupid.

832
01:23:06,389 --> 01:23:08,721
If nothing else, it'll look good
on your college resume.

833
01:23:18,301 --> 01:23:22,067
Look in the sky
at the tiny birds that fly

834
01:23:22,138 --> 01:23:26,006
With wings that move faster
than the eye can see

835
01:23:26,075 --> 01:23:30,068
Hummingbirds

836
01:23:30,146 --> 01:23:33,673
Hooray, Hurrah, Sis-boom-bah

837
01:23:33,750 --> 01:23:37,652
Now put on a smile, kids
Wipe off that frown

838
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:40,086
We're hummable Hummingbirds

839
01:23:40,156 --> 01:23:43,523
Happy and sunny birds
humming all day long

840
01:23:43,593 --> 01:23:47,825
Come and join us in our song

841
01:23:47,897 --> 01:23:49,831
Hum

842
01:23:49,899 --> 01:23:52,163
Hummable Hummingbirds
humming along, we are

843
01:23:52,235 --> 01:23:55,762
Hum hummable Hummingbirds

844
01:23:55,838 --> 01:23:59,069
We go up, up, up into the sky

845
01:23:59,142 --> 01:24:04,705
We're the Hummingbirds
of Benjamin Franklin Junior High
