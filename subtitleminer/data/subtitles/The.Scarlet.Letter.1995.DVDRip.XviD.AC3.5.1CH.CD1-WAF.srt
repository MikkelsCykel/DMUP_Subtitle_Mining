1
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,775
Chief Metacomet.

2
00:02:11,027 --> 00:02:11,976
Without

3
00:02:12,195 --> 00:02:15,231
your father's friendship,
none of us could have survived.

4
00:02:20,371 --> 00:02:22,612
My father should have let you

5
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,405
die!

6
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,296
You are

7
00:02:35,885 --> 00:02:37,260
the only one

8
00:02:38,304 --> 00:02:39,632
who comes to us

9
00:02:40,556 --> 00:02:41,931
with an open heart.

10
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,717
But your people have murdered

11
00:02:47,521 --> 00:02:48,600
my father

12
00:02:49,565 --> 00:02:50,893
with their lies!

13
00:03:29,561 --> 00:03:31,103
My name is Pearl.

14
00:03:31,646 --> 00:03:34,814
This is the story of
my mother, Hester Prynne.

15
00:03:35,401 --> 00:03:38,769
It was the year of our Lord 1666,

16
00:03:38,987 --> 00:03:42,357
when she arrived in the
Massachusetts Bay Colony

17
00:03:42,575 --> 00:03:46,358
filled with the hope that at last,
in this new world

18
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,747
would come the freedom to worship
without fear of persecution.

19
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,754
My esteemed colleague!

20
00:04:05,138 --> 00:04:07,047
Thy years of toil become thee!

21
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,429
Thy fame preceeds thee, sir.

22
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:11,633
Governor Bellingham,

23
00:04:12,561 --> 00:04:13,723
may I present

24
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:16,263
the Reverend Thomas Cheever.

25
00:04:16,482 --> 00:04:19,103
Welcome, sir.
It's a long voyage.

26
00:04:19,318 --> 00:04:21,394
3 months at sea,

27
00:04:21,696 --> 00:04:23,984
will either take away your faith,
or harden it to iron.

28
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:29,237
Allow me to introduce a woman
who's been travelling with us,

29
00:04:29,577 --> 00:04:31,570
- Mistress...
- Hester Prynne.

30
00:04:32,663 --> 00:04:33,909
I apologize for the coarseness

31
00:04:34,124 --> 00:04:35,499
of my hands, Mistress.

32
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:38,034
But here in the colonies,
everyone must work.

33
00:04:38,461 --> 00:04:40,370
I look forward to the hard work.

34
00:04:40,588 --> 00:04:44,372
It says id Psalm 92: "I will
triumph in the work of thy hands".

35
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:47,256
Thou canst quote the Scriptures.

36
00:04:48,179 --> 00:04:51,513
Aye, Reverendo, both Testaments.
My husband taught me.

37
00:04:51,766 --> 00:04:52,797
You must rest.

38
00:04:53,017 --> 00:04:55,259
Then I'll show you
what's been accomplished.

39
00:04:55,478 --> 00:04:56,343
I thank thee.

40
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:58,353
- Then it's Goodwife Prynne.
- Yes, yes.

41
00:05:00,524 --> 00:05:02,397
But I prefer to be called Hester.

42
00:05:02,651 --> 00:05:03,682
Welcome, Hester.

43
00:05:03,902 --> 00:05:05,941
I wish I could've seen it before,

44
00:05:06,154 --> 00:05:08,029
when it was wild and untouched.

45
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:19,532
Madam,

46
00:05:20,293 --> 00:05:23,957
you should use less lace
in your dressmaking.

47
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:28,925
Indeed, Reverend.

48
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,930
Master of us all,

49
00:05:41,981 --> 00:05:44,602
we give thanks for
another bountiful meal,

50
00:05:45,693 --> 00:05:48,230
and for newly arrived disciples,

51
00:05:48,862 --> 00:05:51,104
that share it with us this night.

52
00:05:53,575 --> 00:05:55,199
- Amen.
- Amen.

53
00:05:57,704 --> 00:05:58,653
So, Governor.

54
00:05:58,873 --> 00:06:02,407
I am impatient to know
how you fared with Metacomet.

55
00:06:04,127 --> 00:06:07,247
Well, Metacomet
isn't Massassoit, Major Dunsmuir.

56
00:06:07,714 --> 00:06:11,047
But if we respect the agreements
we made with his father,

57
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,415
we've nothing to fear.

58
00:06:13,636 --> 00:06:15,711
So we don't
grow complacent,

59
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:18,302
our wise God sends us a sign.

60
00:06:19,141 --> 00:06:20,257
When we sailed,

61
00:06:20,477 --> 00:06:23,347
your letters said we were
at peace with the savage.

62
00:06:24,856 --> 00:06:25,721
Well,

63
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:29,393
I fear the days of "peace"
with the Wampanoag is at an end.

64
00:06:29,943 --> 00:06:30,857
Major,

65
00:06:32,112 --> 00:06:34,520
we are frightening
our new arrival.

66
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:40,986
We hear much

67
00:06:41,204 --> 00:06:43,577
of your success
with the praying Indians.

68
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:46,710
I'm very eager to meet
Reverend Dimmesdale

69
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:48,246
and his converts.

70
00:06:49,045 --> 00:06:50,374
The runts of the litter.

71
00:06:51,089 --> 00:06:52,963
Dimmesdale's little treasures!

72
00:06:53,258 --> 00:06:55,001
Some of us
have other opinions.

73
00:06:57,178 --> 00:06:58,293
Mistress Prynne,

74
00:06:58,638 --> 00:07:01,045
I hope you'll stay with us

75
00:07:01,348 --> 00:07:02,973
until your husband's arrival.

76
00:07:03,392 --> 00:07:06,013
You're most kind,
but I intend to find

77
00:07:06,228 --> 00:07:07,973
a house of my own
as soon as possible.

78
00:07:17,781 --> 00:07:18,979
On thine own?

79
00:07:19,491 --> 00:07:20,404
Why, yes.

80
00:07:21,034 --> 00:07:24,119
It's not considered fitting
for a young woman to live alone.

81
00:07:24,913 --> 00:07:28,329
I've come first to prepare
a place for his arrival,

82
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:30,249
so that is what I intend to do.

83
00:07:30,585 --> 00:07:31,665
Mistress Prynne.

84
00:07:32,379 --> 00:07:36,293
The rules we live by may seem
arbitrary to a newcomer,

85
00:07:36,508 --> 00:07:39,045
but we have learnt
the hard way

86
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,754
that without absolute order,

87
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,422
we cannot hope to survive here.

88
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,431
Rules, Mistress Prynne.

89
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:46,882
Order.

90
00:07:48,144 --> 00:07:49,057
Survival.

91
00:07:49,645 --> 00:07:51,472
Would you have me
disobey my husband?

92
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:56,231
- I...
- Reverend, you might enjoy

93
00:07:56,444 --> 00:07:59,279
the company of my son, Brewster.

94
00:07:59,572 --> 00:08:01,399
He studied Divinity.

95
00:08:01,616 --> 00:08:03,573
Harvard wasn't good enough
for him,

96
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:06,073
so he came home to
make his fortune as a...

97
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:09,288
Minister's sons all moaning
the Lord's Prayer

98
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:10,867
in their sleep.

99
00:08:12,834 --> 00:08:14,625
Everyone must find his place.

100
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:19,664
- Morning, Mistress Prynne.
- Good morrow.

101
00:08:30,768 --> 00:08:33,935
So you intend on scandalising
the town!

102
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:35,012
Get up!

103
00:08:36,524 --> 00:08:37,270
Good!

104
00:08:39,651 --> 00:08:40,683
I confess,

105
00:08:40,903 --> 00:08:43,987
I feel alone in a
sea of conformists.

106
00:08:45,824 --> 00:08:47,616
Where should we begin our search?

107
00:08:47,951 --> 00:08:49,826
On the cliffs by the sea.

108
00:08:50,121 --> 00:08:51,829
No, it's out of the question.

109
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:53,620
Why?

110
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:56,325
No one's lived
by the sea

111
00:08:56,918 --> 00:08:59,326
since the Indians
wiped out Ballinger's Point.

112
00:08:59,712 --> 00:09:01,456
I say we start there.

113
00:09:02,965 --> 00:09:05,337
Well, if you've decided.

114
00:09:27,072 --> 00:09:28,780
Is that it, Brewster?

115
00:09:31,869 --> 00:09:33,447
It's beautiful.

116
00:10:00,939 --> 00:10:03,311
I tried to imagine
what herlife was like

117
00:10:03,524 --> 00:10:05,433
before she came
to the new world.

118
00:10:06,193 --> 00:10:08,067
Why did herhusband
send heron ahead,

119
00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:09,728
alone?

120
00:10:10,614 --> 00:10:12,653
Was it a test ofherloyalty,

121
00:10:12,908 --> 00:10:14,152
orherspirit?

122
00:10:15,286 --> 00:10:18,287
Or was it in his nature
to set traps

123
00:10:18,498 --> 00:10:21,285
forpeople in the hope
they would fall into them?

124
00:10:30,174 --> 00:10:31,206
It's perfect!

125
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:34,083
With a cart and a musket,
I could have a home here!

126
00:10:35,096 --> 00:10:36,804
A cart, a horse,

127
00:10:37,348 --> 00:10:38,759
a pitchfork, a plow.

128
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:41,216
I can think of better things

129
00:10:41,435 --> 00:10:43,393
to do with these pretty hands
than grow calluses on them.

130
00:10:44,355 --> 00:10:46,763
I'll need indentured labor,
at least two men.

131
00:10:47,191 --> 00:10:50,358
- The land needs draining.
- You are headstrong.

132
00:10:51,905 --> 00:10:53,564
Perhaps it runs in the blood.

133
00:10:54,282 --> 00:10:56,440
I'm told your father was too.

134
00:10:57,368 --> 00:10:58,447
Is it true

135
00:10:59,411 --> 00:11:02,945
he was in debt to your husband
and you were the payment?

136
00:11:05,877 --> 00:11:07,786
I've said something
to disturb you.

137
00:11:08,296 --> 00:11:09,244
I'm sorry.

138
00:11:10,005 --> 00:11:11,381
I'm truly sorry.

139
00:11:13,467 --> 00:11:15,625
God, thou art wondrous fair!

140
00:11:22,558 --> 00:11:23,508
That hurt!

141
00:11:24,019 --> 00:11:26,343
Good. It'll remind you
not to do it again.

142
00:11:28,481 --> 00:11:30,308
Faith?
Prudence?

143
00:11:44,997 --> 00:11:48,200
Did you hear Mistress Prynne
has a bathing tub?

144
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:50,705
What is she, French?

145
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,931
2 Shillings.
Will you bid 2 shillings?

146
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,888
2 and a half?

147
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:14,023
Come on, gentlemen,
do I have a bid for 3 shillings?

148
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:15,811
3 shillings?

149
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:17,854
3 shillings?

150
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,980
Anyone else?
Anyone else?

151
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:23,199
Going for 3 shillings.
Any other bids?

152
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,612
Sold to the gentleman
for 3 shillings.

153
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,905
- Next we have this other one,
- Those two.

154
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,122
How much time left
on their indenture?

155
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:32,792
About 3 years, but,

156
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:37,207
shouldn't your husband or father
be doing business with me?

157
00:12:37,547 --> 00:12:39,540
Is my money
no good to you, sir?

158
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,835
Your money's as fine as wine
in the sunshine, Mistress.

159
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:48,098
If you buy them at a just price,
I'll throw in the girl in red.

160
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,508
She's a slave!

161
00:12:50,727 --> 00:12:54,012
But she don't speak, if that
be a problem. Born that way.

162
00:12:56,274 --> 00:12:57,472
Name your just price.

163
00:13:35,687 --> 00:13:38,687
We'd best accompany you
if your going to the forest.

164
00:13:39,065 --> 00:13:41,770
Don't worry Mr Bobbin.
I shan't go far.

165
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:46,844
Mistress Prynne?
Mistress Prynne?

166
00:15:47,063 --> 00:15:48,142
Mistress Prynne?

167
00:15:48,356 --> 00:15:49,601
Where are you?

168
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:51,938
Mistress Prynne, where are you?

169
00:15:54,904 --> 00:15:56,648
I found her.

170
00:15:56,865 --> 00:15:58,028
- You did not.
- I did to.

171
00:15:58,241 --> 00:16:00,033
- You did not.
- I did to.

172
00:16:01,036 --> 00:16:01,865
Mistress Prynne,

173
00:16:02,787 --> 00:16:05,741
Have you forgotten
it is the Sabbath?

174
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,035
Of course not.
Forgive me.

175
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:13,248
We've come by especially
to bring you to church.

176
00:16:15,049 --> 00:16:16,757
Thank you, so much.

177
00:16:17,635 --> 00:16:19,177
Please, go on without me.

178
00:16:19,387 --> 00:16:21,296
I will follow at once.

179
00:16:21,555 --> 00:16:22,634
Make haste.

180
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:23,970
Yes, sir.

181
00:16:48,373 --> 00:16:49,404
All right, girl,

182
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:51,157
Come on.

183
00:17:03,928 --> 00:17:05,305
Oh goodnes!

184
00:17:07,517 --> 00:17:08,927
Back up. Back up.

185
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,137
Come on now, back up.

186
00:17:17,108 --> 00:17:19,480
Come on. Come on. Back up.

187
00:17:20,278 --> 00:17:21,227
Good morrow.

188
00:17:28,286 --> 00:17:29,911
May I be of assistance?

189
00:17:31,539 --> 00:17:33,117
Not from up there.

190
00:17:34,542 --> 00:17:35,455
Come on.

191
00:17:40,673 --> 00:17:42,665
Come on.
Steady. Steady.

192
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:53,890
I can't make this horse
understand me.

193
00:17:54,811 --> 00:17:56,721
Let me try.

194
00:17:59,316 --> 00:18:01,143
Come on, girl.

195
00:18:01,568 --> 00:18:02,943
Come on, back up!

196
00:18:04,029 --> 00:18:05,571
Come on, girl.

197
00:18:07,281 --> 00:18:09,238
Come on. Come on.

198
00:18:13,621 --> 00:18:15,864
I'm afraid you're in too deep.

199
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:18,917
She'll not make it.
Let me try this.

200
00:18:22,088 --> 00:18:24,246
I do hope you can get it free.

201
00:18:24,465 --> 00:18:27,216
I'm already late for the service,
and everyone's talking about me.

202
00:18:27,843 --> 00:18:31,426
I've been away and I'm quite
behind on local gossip.

203
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,254
I bought the old Newbury place
out on Ballinger's Point.

204
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:35,929
Then,

205
00:18:36,852 --> 00:18:38,559
I owe you an apology.

206
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,771
I've been trespassing.

207
00:18:41,982 --> 00:18:44,603
There's a place at the point
where I like to bath.

208
00:18:44,859 --> 00:18:47,612
Really? Well, I shan't charge
too steep a tariff.

209
00:18:49,615 --> 00:18:51,903
Come on, girl, back up!

210
00:18:52,826 --> 00:18:54,652
- Back up.
- One,

211
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:56,283
Two,

212
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:00,997
Two. Three.

213
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:10,009
I'm afraid this cart will be
stuck here until Sabbath next

214
00:19:10,218 --> 00:19:12,755
unless I gather hands to help.

215
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,714
Would you care to ride with me?

216
00:19:15,973 --> 00:19:17,550
On your horse, with you?

217
00:19:17,808 --> 00:19:19,847
Aye, unless you can ride.

218
00:19:21,312 --> 00:19:22,426
I can ride.

219
00:19:23,397 --> 00:19:26,231
You take my horse
and I'll take yours.

220
00:19:26,566 --> 00:19:30,101
There's a shortcut
to the meeting house,

221
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,779
but it's a difficult road.

222
00:19:32,656 --> 00:19:34,315
I shall manage, sir.

223
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:42,995
- Are you certain?
- Just you lead the way.

224
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:51,998
Come on! Come on!

225
00:20:07,772 --> 00:20:09,812
Come on! Come on!

226
00:20:26,207 --> 00:20:27,998
May God be with you.

227
00:20:28,667 --> 00:20:30,376
I'm sure he already is.

228
00:20:32,171 --> 00:20:34,080
But aren't you coming to...

229
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,817
Good Sabbath to ye all.

230
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:06,489
Friends,

231
00:21:07,164 --> 00:21:09,370
and fellow voyagers,

232
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:12,073
in the greatest of all dreams.

233
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:16,245
We've been singled out,
like Israel of old,

234
00:21:16,505 --> 00:21:18,296
to serve as a model.

235
00:21:19,299 --> 00:21:21,672
But if we are to succeed

236
00:21:22,011 --> 00:21:24,881
in building our new Jerusalem,

237
00:21:25,347 --> 00:21:27,969
our "City on a Hill",

238
00:21:29,185 --> 00:21:31,510
then the power of love,

239
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,890
yea, His Divine Love,

240
00:21:35,107 --> 00:21:37,777
we must bind our hearts as one!

241
00:21:38,486 --> 00:21:41,107
English and Indian,

242
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:44,485
gentry and indentured,
free man and slaves,

243
00:21:44,741 --> 00:21:46,733
and make of us

244
00:21:46,951 --> 00:21:49,074
an example for all the world,

245
00:21:49,287 --> 00:21:51,494
to marvel at and proclaim:

246
00:21:51,706 --> 00:21:53,035
"Here...

247
00:21:54,084 --> 00:21:57,001
is the measure of perfection!

248
00:21:57,421 --> 00:21:58,998
Here,

249
00:21:59,464 --> 00:22:01,540
lives God's own!"

250
00:22:02,133 --> 00:22:04,671
But we are not succeeding
in that test.

251
00:22:04,927 --> 00:22:07,548
We are failing!
And why?

252
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:10,468
Because we covet,
nay,

253
00:22:11,309 --> 00:22:14,678
we lust after
what is not ours.

254
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,935
Be it for the rich land
of our Indian brothers,

255
00:22:18,149 --> 00:22:20,521
be it for glory,

256
00:22:20,943 --> 00:22:23,647
for profits or for revenge.

257
00:22:23,904 --> 00:22:26,192
Need I read the secret

258
00:22:26,656 --> 00:22:28,733
of every heart?

259
00:22:28,951 --> 00:22:30,860
I will if you want.

260
00:22:31,078 --> 00:22:33,699
Yea, I will if you want.

261
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,203
I will lay open the secrets

262
00:22:36,416 --> 00:22:39,121
before the eyes of God!

263
00:22:39,544 --> 00:22:42,628
What thou lusteth after is my enemy,
sayeth the Lord God.

264
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:44,914
For only I shall consume thee,

265
00:22:45,509 --> 00:22:48,794
only I shall fill thee up.

266
00:22:49,804 --> 00:22:52,923
If thou failest to heed
my commandments,

267
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,097
then my fist

268
00:22:55,309 --> 00:22:58,309
shall descend on thee
like a stone!

269
00:22:59,396 --> 00:23:02,065
And thy sword shall cut thee
into bloody parts,

270
00:23:02,317 --> 00:23:04,393
and even thy memories
shall be sacrificed

271
00:23:04,611 --> 00:23:06,982
to the winds
for all time!

272
00:23:08,239 --> 00:23:09,816
May God bless you,

273
00:23:11,908 --> 00:23:14,031
each and every one of you.

274
00:23:15,453 --> 00:23:16,781
Amén.

275
00:23:17,372 --> 00:23:18,320
Amén.

276
00:23:19,499 --> 00:23:22,749
Allow me to present a newcomer
to our congregation,

277
00:23:22,961 --> 00:23:24,241
Mistress Roger Prynne.

278
00:23:25,046 --> 00:23:25,828
Mistress Roger?

279
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:29,167
Aye, her husband, a renowned
physician will join her before...

280
00:23:29,384 --> 00:23:31,507
Reverednd Dimmesdale and I
have already...

281
00:23:31,886 --> 00:23:34,840
I helped when her cart
got stuck in the woods.

282
00:23:37,225 --> 00:23:39,597
I greatly enjoyed your sermon.

283
00:23:40,102 --> 00:23:44,052
It's rare for a man so young
to speak with such passion.

284
00:23:45,399 --> 00:23:47,557
For some reason,

285
00:23:47,817 --> 00:23:49,940
I felt most inspired today.

286
00:23:50,404 --> 00:23:53,904
We welcome you and your husband
to our congregation.

287
00:23:57,077 --> 00:23:58,488
Mother! Mother!

288
00:24:10,089 --> 00:24:11,632
There you are, Hester.

289
00:24:11,841 --> 00:24:14,131
Meet my friend, Running Moose.
He's our schoolmaster.

290
00:24:14,344 --> 00:24:16,633
And I'm sure you'd like
some refreshment.

291
00:24:16,847 --> 00:24:19,515
Do you teach the English children
as well Mr Running Moose?

292
00:24:19,766 --> 00:24:22,054
They call me John or Johnny here.

293
00:24:22,268 --> 00:24:25,352
We try our best, but the English
are a bit slow-witted.

294
00:24:25,604 --> 00:24:27,015
Slow-witted?

295
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:30,565
Johnny's a bit of a jester,
but he was our first praying Indian.

296
00:24:31,402 --> 00:24:32,979
My best friend in the colony.

297
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,018
Arthur,

298
00:24:35,489 --> 00:24:38,360
- this is Mistress...
- We've already met.

299
00:24:39,326 --> 00:24:40,701
Excuse me.

300
00:24:47,126 --> 00:24:48,869
So like home.

301
00:24:49,586 --> 00:24:52,955
Yet beyond those trees
I suspect a savagery,

302
00:24:53,256 --> 00:24:55,248
of savage passions,

303
00:24:55,466 --> 00:24:57,791
dark and untamed.

304
00:24:58,886 --> 00:25:01,805
Reverend Dimmesdale,
have you met our young friend?

305
00:25:02,057 --> 00:25:03,635
Yes, we've met.

306
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:07,136
Mistress Prynne and I
traveled out on the same ship.

307
00:25:07,353 --> 00:25:09,227
I'm going to marry him one day.

308
00:25:09,439 --> 00:25:12,772
No you're not, I'm going to
aren't I Mistress Prynne?

309
00:25:12,983 --> 00:25:16,316
- Marry whom?
- Reverend Dimmesdale, of course!

310
00:25:35,296 --> 00:25:38,748
"A Short Description of the
Great and Last Judgement".

311
00:25:39,801 --> 00:25:43,252
Well, "Platform for
Church Discipline".

312
00:25:44,305 --> 00:25:46,463
They're all tracts!

313
00:25:53,773 --> 00:25:55,766
"The Goodwife's Manual... "

314
00:25:56,025 --> 00:25:57,056
for Animal Husbandry"

315
00:25:58,694 --> 00:26:00,521
I believe we've already met.

316
00:26:00,738 --> 00:26:03,063
Oh, yes, I...
I'm sorry, I didn't realize.

317
00:26:03,323 --> 00:26:05,197
I should have
announced my presence.

318
00:26:12,165 --> 00:26:13,660
What are you reading?

319
00:26:13,876 --> 00:26:16,581
- "Comus", it's by John
- John Milton.

320
00:26:16,795 --> 00:26:18,289
I know it. I've read it.

321
00:26:19,006 --> 00:26:19,835
Have you?

322
00:26:20,132 --> 00:26:22,373
I'm not all counterpanes
and coverlets.

323
00:26:22,634 --> 00:26:24,875
Every spare moment, I read.

324
00:26:26,137 --> 00:26:27,881
I'm the same.

325
00:26:28,139 --> 00:26:31,804
I've read every book in this room.
Some of them several times.

326
00:26:32,018 --> 00:26:34,555
Even "Manual for Animal Husbandry?"

327
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:36,513
A most exhiliarating read.

328
00:26:48,784 --> 00:26:52,366
So, did you truly
enjoy my sermon?

329
00:26:52,663 --> 00:26:55,200
Yes, it was most skilful.

330
00:26:55,415 --> 00:26:57,740
Clearly your congregation
reverences you.

331
00:26:57,959 --> 00:27:01,744
You liked it not. We don't
come up to London standards.

332
00:27:02,381 --> 00:27:05,417
To the contrary.
I was moved by your passion.

333
00:27:06,969 --> 00:27:07,917
And?

334
00:27:10,889 --> 00:27:11,719
Well,

335
00:27:14,892 --> 00:27:17,217
when your fist struck your hand,

336
00:27:17,436 --> 00:27:20,556
and sliced through the air
like a sword,

337
00:27:20,815 --> 00:27:22,854
I found myself wondering

338
00:27:23,275 --> 00:27:27,143
what manner of pain lay
beneath such forceful oratory.

339
00:27:29,198 --> 00:27:32,234
Your tongue knows no rules,
Mistress Prynne.

340
00:27:34,286 --> 00:27:36,160
And if it did, Reverend,

341
00:27:36,372 --> 00:27:37,996
what purpose would it serve?

342
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,825
And here I thought
comprehending God

343
00:27:42,043 --> 00:27:44,250
was to be my greatest challenge.

344
00:27:53,722 --> 00:27:54,801
Yes, Reverend?

345
00:27:55,891 --> 00:27:58,013
This morning in the forest,

346
00:27:58,435 --> 00:28:00,593
why did you not say
you were married?

347
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:02,887
Why did you not say
you were a minister?

348
00:28:04,565 --> 00:28:06,771
Good day, Mistress Prynne.

349
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:21,286
Good morrow, Mistress Prynne.

350
00:28:21,498 --> 00:28:22,411
Good morrow.

351
00:28:22,624 --> 00:28:24,498
You care for a cup of cider?

352
00:28:24,751 --> 00:28:27,243
We are your neighbours, it seems.

353
00:28:27,713 --> 00:28:30,168
Did you like the sermon
this morning?

354
00:28:30,549 --> 00:28:33,834
From where I sat it
seemed it did please thee.

355
00:28:34,636 --> 00:28:36,712
I liked it very much.

356
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:39,006
I thought the
young minister very...

357
00:28:39,224 --> 00:28:39,923
Handsome?

358
00:28:43,269 --> 00:28:44,812
Harriet Hibbons.

359
00:28:48,107 --> 00:28:49,222
Ruth?

360
00:28:51,277 --> 00:28:52,605
How do you do?

361
00:28:52,862 --> 00:28:55,186
Come and meet some of
the others who were not invited

362
00:28:55,447 --> 00:28:57,736
to the Governer's shindig.

363
00:28:58,033 --> 00:29:00,191
Sally Short, Mistress Prynne.

364
00:29:00,451 --> 00:29:01,200
How do you do?

365
00:29:01,413 --> 00:29:03,286
I was on the dock
when you arrived.

366
00:29:03,498 --> 00:29:04,908
Mary Rollins.

367
00:29:07,168 --> 00:29:10,204
Mary don't like to speak much.

368
00:29:10,462 --> 00:29:13,665
She's only been free from
the savages this half year.

369
00:29:13,882 --> 00:29:17,631
And Matona don't trust
the English, do you dear?

370
00:29:18,303 --> 00:29:19,928
Mistress Prynne?

371
00:29:20,222 --> 00:29:22,463
Thank you, no.
I never imbibe.

372
00:29:27,479 --> 00:29:29,767
You've gathered some fine
Balm of Gilead,

373
00:29:29,981 --> 00:29:31,808
Shepherd's Purse, yarrow.

374
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,644
You know your plants?

375
00:29:34,903 --> 00:29:36,895
I do. I recite "Culpepper"
by heart.

376
00:29:37,989 --> 00:29:39,317
Really?

377
00:29:43,368 --> 00:29:46,986
Then what would you use to
heal a bad burn?

378
00:29:47,372 --> 00:29:49,579
I've seen sweet fern work miracles,

379
00:29:49,792 --> 00:29:52,118
but Culpepper suggests blackberry
and red cedar.

380
00:29:52,462 --> 00:29:54,288
Well, you hear that.

381
00:29:56,382 --> 00:29:59,299
My husband has
a very large library

382
00:29:59,509 --> 00:30:01,003
and I was able to school myself.

383
00:30:02,137 --> 00:30:05,054
How do you like our new
Jerusalem?

384
00:30:06,307 --> 00:30:08,050
Sober enough for you?

385
00:30:11,646 --> 00:30:12,809
Aye,

386
00:30:13,815 --> 00:30:15,357
sober enough.

387
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:22,739
What I miss is the dancing.

388
00:30:23,115 --> 00:30:24,230
Dancing?

389
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:26,028
When first we came,

390
00:30:26,285 --> 00:30:28,823
they'd be dancing round
the maypole.

391
00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:31,529
Feast days we'd sing
bawdy songs.

392
00:30:31,749 --> 00:30:33,788
People weren't afraid
to play the fool.

393
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,290
We'd teach
the bears to dance.

394
00:30:36,504 --> 00:30:40,168
Now days, everybody getting more
and more sourfaced and ponderous.

395
00:30:40,924 --> 00:30:44,792
And a whipping post stands
where the mayppole used to be.

396
00:30:45,554 --> 00:30:49,254
But there's a few of us who
haven't forgotten to laugh.

397
00:30:53,603 --> 00:30:55,844
It's been a pleasure
meeting you all.

398
00:30:56,063 --> 00:30:58,139
I'm sorry I must take my leave,

399
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,811
but I don't want to be stuck
in the wilds at night.

400
00:31:02,029 --> 00:31:04,235
There are things that sound to me,

401
00:31:04,447 --> 00:31:06,772
the wilds at night are
my natural territory.

402
00:31:06,991 --> 00:31:09,564
Particulary when there's
a full moon.

403
00:31:09,827 --> 00:31:12,744
Do you try to frighten me
with this witch talk?

404
00:31:12,955 --> 00:31:14,781
Not so, Mistress Prynne.

405
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:19,496
But I can see
what others cannot.

406
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:22,501
Be a curse, to be sure,

407
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:25,878
but I know the hearts of men.

408
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:29,593
And what does my heart tell you?

409
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:34,803
You're a most comely woman.

410
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:39,304
Let a man tremble
who wins the hand of a maid,

411
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:44,274
but possesses not the
full passion of her heart.

412
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:50,563
My husband has nothing to fear.

413
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,616
Good day Mistress Hibbons.

414
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:59,448
Good day, Mistress Prynne.

415
00:32:20,979 --> 00:32:22,639
Good day, Goody Gotwick.

416
00:32:22,855 --> 00:32:25,312
I brought these for
Reverend Dimmesdale.

417
00:32:25,525 --> 00:32:28,098
The Reverend be occupied
with his work, Missus.

418
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:31,190
Leave them books on the table
and I'll be sure he gets them.

419
00:32:36,786 --> 00:32:38,363
Good morrow, Reverend.

420
00:32:38,621 --> 00:32:41,076
Good morrow, Mistress Prynne.

421
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:44,199
Knowing you hunger for new reading,

422
00:32:44,419 --> 00:32:46,625
I brought you some books.

423
00:32:49,506 --> 00:32:51,250
How courteous of you.

424
00:32:54,177 --> 00:32:55,208
Please.

425
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:06,386
I must apologize for my
forthrightness on Sabbath last.

426
00:33:06,898 --> 00:33:10,516
I've earned a few reprimands
for speaking too bluntly.

427
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:15,773
I owe an apology, too.

428
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,983
I can't understand why
I took such offence

429
00:33:21,662 --> 00:33:23,073
to such a simple comment.

430
00:33:25,917 --> 00:33:27,743
But I have wondered

431
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:30,829
how you were able

432
00:33:32,631 --> 00:33:34,090
to see so deeply

433
00:33:35,343 --> 00:33:36,457
into my nature.

434
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:39,215
Perhaps I'm a witch.

435
00:33:53,485 --> 00:33:55,691
I must be keeping you
from your chores.

436
00:33:56,738 --> 00:33:58,896
Thank you for the books.

437
00:33:59,157 --> 00:34:00,152
Good day.

438
00:34:01,576 --> 00:34:03,782
I'm sorry. My hands
are covered in ink.

439
00:34:05,287 --> 00:34:06,283
I've been

440
00:34:08,291 --> 00:34:11,458
hovered over
my translations all day.

441
00:34:11,878 --> 00:34:13,041
Translations?

442
00:34:13,296 --> 00:34:15,537
Aye. I'm attempting to

443
00:34:16,173 --> 00:34:19,423
translate the Bible into
the local Indian language,

444
00:34:19,635 --> 00:34:20,500
Algonquin.

445
00:34:21,053 --> 00:34:23,128
What an ambitious undertaking.

446
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:27,057
But I'm told the Indians don't want
to be guided by our Bible.

447
00:34:27,267 --> 00:34:29,011
That war with them is inevitable.

448
00:34:29,561 --> 00:34:31,637
Some think that way,
but they're wrong.

449
00:34:31,855 --> 00:34:34,940
The Indians, born from a
certain liberty,

450
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:37,059
take not easily
to bridle and bit.

451
00:34:38,862 --> 00:34:39,941
No man should.

452
00:34:41,531 --> 00:34:42,278
Well...

453
00:34:50,498 --> 00:34:51,446
What?

454
00:34:54,084 --> 00:34:54,784
What?

455
00:34:56,711 --> 00:34:58,836
You keep putting ink
on your face.

456
00:34:59,925 --> 00:35:00,838
Oh, I do.

457
00:35:08,932 --> 00:35:09,881
There you are.

458
00:35:15,104 --> 00:35:17,062
I do hope you enjoy
the books.

459
00:35:17,607 --> 00:35:19,232
Thank you.

460
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:21,559
Good day.

461
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,025
Good day.

462
00:35:51,766 --> 00:35:52,596
Mituba?

463
00:35:55,311 --> 00:35:59,011
'Tis only a bathing tub,
not a toy of Satan.

464
00:39:00,823 --> 00:39:02,151
Mistress Prynne?

465
00:39:05,911 --> 00:39:07,025
Reverend Dimmesdale!

466
00:39:08,038 --> 00:39:11,371
- You frightened me.
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

467
00:39:13,375 --> 00:39:14,954
It's a wonderful surprise.

468
00:39:18,422 --> 00:39:20,379
- It's beautiful.
- Yes, and frightening.

469
00:39:21,968 --> 00:39:23,795
Just as Eden must have been.

470
00:39:24,387 --> 00:39:25,762
So untouched.

471
00:39:27,556 --> 00:39:29,881
Does it not cry out
with it's promise,

472
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,224
that everything
can begin anew?

473
00:39:35,731 --> 00:39:37,391
I brought back your books.

474
00:39:38,358 --> 00:39:40,434
You couldn't have read them all
in four days.

475
00:39:40,652 --> 00:39:43,487
Oh no, I did.
I read most of them twice.

476
00:39:48,076 --> 00:39:48,990
Thank you.

477
00:39:50,579 --> 00:39:51,610
You're welcome.

478
00:39:53,206 --> 00:39:54,202
Farewell.

479
00:40:02,673 --> 00:40:03,586
Hester...

480
00:40:04,341 --> 00:40:06,169
I'm not the man I seem.

481
00:40:08,929 --> 00:40:12,465
I've lived here all my life,
my purpose clear.

482
00:40:13,351 --> 00:40:17,218
But now I'd risk everything,
my life, my ministry, my soul

483
00:40:17,688 --> 00:40:19,764
just to spend a few
moments alone with you.

484
00:40:21,775 --> 00:40:23,270
God help me, Hester.

485
00:40:23,778 --> 00:40:25,106
I love thee.

486
00:40:28,782 --> 00:40:31,023
God help me.
I love thee too.

487
00:40:35,205 --> 00:40:37,493
Oh God. Have we lost our way?

488
00:40:38,666 --> 00:40:39,448
No!

489
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:45,454
I dreamed of thee speaking
thy heart.

490
00:40:46,299 --> 00:40:49,216
I have prayed for it even as
I have dreaded it.

491
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:54,596
Was I alive before
I laid eyes on thee?

492
00:41:01,648 --> 00:41:02,810
What shall we do?

493
00:41:04,942 --> 00:41:06,021
I know not.

494
00:41:07,903 --> 00:41:09,860
Say something to end it,

495
00:41:10,572 --> 00:41:11,947
for I have not the power.

496
00:41:14,743 --> 00:41:15,739
Nor I.

497
00:41:23,168 --> 00:41:24,164
Nay!

498
00:41:26,212 --> 00:41:28,039
We could be hanged for this.

499
00:41:39,099 --> 00:41:41,424
I've put you in too much danger,

500
00:41:42,477 --> 00:41:45,562
and I must end it by walking away
and never speaking with you again.

501
00:41:53,781 --> 00:41:54,776
Go then.

502
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:57,945
Do as you promised.
