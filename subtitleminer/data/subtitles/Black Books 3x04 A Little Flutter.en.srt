2
00:00:33,007 --> 00:00:35,760
Bernard! It's nearly on! Come on.

3
00:00:35,807 --> 00:00:38,605
- What's on?
- It. Come on!

4
00:00:39,167 --> 00:00:43,957
You happy? You happy now?
Here's your goddamn book store.

5
00:00:44,007 --> 00:00:46,157
Nyuh nyuh nyuh nyuh nyuh.

6
00:00:46,207 --> 00:00:50,485
Hey, mister. You got anything
on armouries, weaponry?

7
00:00:50,527 --> 00:00:52,916
Military history is on your right.

8
00:00:52,967 --> 00:00:55,959
I don't want your little history grotto.

9
00:00:56,007 --> 00:01:00,637
I want modern warfare.
Infrared. Fallout. Kill zones.

10
00:01:00,687 --> 00:01:05,238
On your right. If you need help,
fire some rounds into the ceiling.

11
00:01:07,887 --> 00:01:09,286
Bernard...

12
00:01:09,327 --> 00:01:11,124
Ow!

13
00:01:15,567 --> 00:01:18,127
- £30.
- Hey, that's expensive!

14
00:01:18,167 --> 00:01:21,159
Will you shut up
and pay the Scotch man?

15
00:01:26,607 --> 00:01:28,598
Come on. Come on.

16
00:01:29,407 --> 00:01:31,557
Come on.

17
00:01:31,607 --> 00:01:34,075
- What?
- Come on!

18
00:01:35,407 --> 00:01:39,446
It's Grand National day.
Look, I got us a runner each.

19
00:01:39,487 --> 00:01:44,117
Is this what you spend your
pocket money on - filthy gambling?

20
00:01:44,167 --> 00:01:46,158
It's not really gambling.

21
00:01:46,207 --> 00:01:49,802
It's a moment when
the whole nation comes together,

22
00:01:49,847 --> 00:01:52,839
like the opening
of a Richard Curtis movie

23
00:01:52,887 --> 00:01:55,447
or the manhunt for a serial killer.

24
00:01:55,487 --> 00:01:58,843
You're Inner Space and I'm Herr Schmidt.

25
00:01:58,887 --> 00:02:00,878
Eh?

26
00:02:01,527 --> 00:02:04,564
And they're off! Look!
Come on, come on.

27
00:02:04,607 --> 00:02:08,236
Over they go.
Come on, boy, girl, or whatever you are.

28
00:02:08,287 --> 00:02:12,519
- Oh, he fell.
- What happens when they fall?

29
00:02:12,567 --> 00:02:17,004
They give them oats, then shoot them
in the head. But yours is still in.

30
00:02:17,047 --> 00:02:21,199
You put our money on
this circus of death. You disgust me!

31
00:02:23,887 --> 00:02:27,880
Come on! Come on!
Come on, you... Jimmy! Jimmy!

32
00:02:27,927 --> 00:02:29,485
Come on.

33
00:02:29,527 --> 00:02:33,236
'... at eight to one
wins the Grand National. '

34
00:02:34,567 --> 00:02:38,116
Bernard, you came second
but I put on an each-way bet.

35
00:02:38,167 --> 00:02:41,159
- That means you still win.
- I win?

36
00:02:42,087 --> 00:02:44,521
- How much?
- Well, let me see.

37
00:02:44,567 --> 00:02:48,958
It was 12-1, but it was
an each-way so...

38
00:02:49,767 --> 00:02:51,758
£1.50.

39
00:02:53,727 --> 00:02:57,720
- How do I collect it?
- You take the slip back. I'll do it.

40
00:02:57,767 --> 00:02:59,758
All right.

41
00:03:01,567 --> 00:03:04,639
- Now, listen.
- Wh...?

42
00:03:05,647 --> 00:03:09,322
Don't. Lose. This.

43
00:03:21,327 --> 00:03:24,478
Yah! All I need is some kind of system.

44
00:03:24,527 --> 00:03:26,961
Tuh! There's only one system -

45
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:30,238
bet, lose, borrow, steal,

46
00:03:30,287 --> 00:03:34,565
lose, take the drugs... lose, prison,

47
00:03:34,607 --> 00:03:36,598
death.

48
00:03:36,647 --> 00:03:39,207
Don't get pious, you started me off.

49
00:03:39,247 --> 00:03:42,762
That's just a flutter.
This is Satan's bingo.

50
00:03:42,807 --> 00:03:45,879
- Well, I was born to win.
- Oh, yeah?

51
00:03:45,927 --> 00:03:49,397
- All right, heads or tails?
- Heads.

52
00:03:49,447 --> 00:03:51,642
All right, I'll give you that one.

53
00:03:51,687 --> 00:03:54,121
- Right, here we go.
- Tails.

54
00:03:54,927 --> 00:03:57,236
You had two kisses from Lady Luck.

55
00:03:57,287 --> 00:04:00,324
Now she's gonna
knee you in the rattlers.

56
00:04:00,367 --> 00:04:03,484
- Tails.
- Yeah, but sooner or later...

57
00:04:04,047 --> 00:04:07,926
I'll run out of money.
Fran, have you got a pound?

58
00:04:07,967 --> 00:04:12,245
No. Can't waste money. Gotta get
a new outfit for my job interview.

59
00:04:12,287 --> 00:04:15,484
I'm feeling confident.
I'm gonna get this job.

60
00:04:15,527 --> 00:04:17,518
You don't stand a chance.

61
00:04:17,567 --> 00:04:21,242
Nobody would employ you
because you're unemployable.

62
00:04:21,287 --> 00:04:25,724
I'd like to help you but I can't,
because you're so totally useless.

63
00:04:28,407 --> 00:04:31,399
You could let me
do a couple of days here.

64
00:04:31,447 --> 00:04:33,881
Then I can say I'm currently working.

65
00:04:33,927 --> 00:04:36,395
We could work together. It'd be fun.

66
00:04:36,447 --> 00:04:40,440
We could read magazines and speculate
about famous people's sexuality.

67
00:04:40,487 --> 00:04:44,958
This place is already
riddled with life-sucking parasites.

68
00:04:45,007 --> 00:04:48,397
Oh, give me a job. Just till the interview.

69
00:04:48,447 --> 00:04:52,565
No, Fran, he's changed.
He's on the gee-gees now.

70
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,598
Bernard.

71
00:04:59,887 --> 00:05:01,684
Bernard!

72
00:05:02,727 --> 00:05:04,718
I bet you...

73
00:05:06,567 --> 00:05:10,719
20 quid I'm so hopeless
I never get another job ever.

74
00:05:11,607 --> 00:05:15,759
I'll give you a job.
You start tomorrow. Ha! Ha! Ha!

75
00:05:34,647 --> 00:05:37,115
- Colleague.
- Co-worker.

76
00:05:37,967 --> 00:05:43,246
Right. You, keep an eye on her.
And you, keep an eye on him.

77
00:05:43,287 --> 00:05:45,721
I've got a universe to master.

78
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,956
The boss is away. Even better!

79
00:05:50,007 --> 00:05:52,999
- I brought croissants.
- Hooray!

80
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:57,926
Aha... So, what did you see
on TV last night?

81
00:05:57,967 --> 00:06:01,801
Didn't watch it.
Don't watch much TV. What about you?

82
00:06:01,847 --> 00:06:03,758
No. Wasn't much on.

83
00:06:24,247 --> 00:06:29,560
"Please may I have a bet
on Via Appia in the Lingfield race

84
00:06:29,607 --> 00:06:33,156
"at 3:30 this afternoon? Thank you.

85
00:06:33,207 --> 00:06:36,836
"I will bet ten pounds
that this horse wins.

86
00:06:36,887 --> 00:06:40,846
"Here is my ten pounds. Thank you.

87
00:06:40,887 --> 00:06:46,245
"I hope it wins.
Yours faithfully, Bernard Black. "

88
00:06:56,247 --> 00:07:01,480
Now, this is the desk
and this is the chair.

89
00:07:01,527 --> 00:07:04,837
- I know. Now, I thought...
- Don't interrupt.

90
00:07:04,887 --> 00:07:08,641
This is the till and this stays on the desk.

91
00:07:08,687 --> 00:07:11,679
- The chair remains next to the desk.
- Stop.

92
00:07:11,727 --> 00:07:15,515
This is a woman who ran
her own business for years.

93
00:07:15,567 --> 00:07:19,446
- Come on, there's work to do.
- You're keen. I like that.

94
00:07:20,287 --> 00:07:23,916
But wait. This is the book.

95
00:07:25,287 --> 00:07:28,836
Now, when we make a sale,
it goes in the book.

96
00:07:28,887 --> 00:07:31,560
The title goes here, the cost goes here.

97
00:07:31,607 --> 00:07:33,996
At the end of the day, we add up.

98
00:07:35,527 --> 00:07:37,597
Where's the running total?

99
00:07:37,647 --> 00:07:41,481
- It... You don't need one.
- We'll keep a running total.

100
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:44,803
- There's no column for it.
- Yes, there is.

101
00:07:45,607 --> 00:07:49,122
The... the... the book! The book!

102
00:07:50,287 --> 00:07:52,676
Come on! Come on! Yes!

103
00:07:52,727 --> 00:07:56,436
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

104
00:07:56,487 --> 00:07:58,284
Bastard!

105
00:08:02,687 --> 00:08:04,962
- Bad day?
- No, it's good.

106
00:08:05,007 --> 00:08:07,237
I've had it with this caper.

107
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:11,360
So you haven't stuck anything
on Au Naturel in the five o'clock.

108
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:14,399
- Shame. Can't lose.
- Yeah, yeah.

109
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:23,197
Why can't it... we lose?

110
00:08:23,967 --> 00:08:28,358
It loves the soft. The jockey has
only eaten minted peas for a month

111
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:32,082
and they're trying
to put his house on the race.

112
00:08:36,527 --> 00:08:39,963
- Au Naturel in the five o'clock.
- That's 100-1.

113
00:08:40,007 --> 00:08:41,998
What? No, no.

114
00:08:43,647 --> 00:08:46,764
- Which horse, then?
- Erm... French Pie.

115
00:08:46,807 --> 00:08:50,800
You think it's the right decision -
you're giving me that look.

116
00:08:50,847 --> 00:08:54,999
Wryly amused and also
faintly disgusted and depressed.

117
00:08:55,047 --> 00:08:57,607
There you go, French Pie.

118
00:08:57,647 --> 00:09:01,720
'And it's Au Naturel,
the winner by six lengths.

119
00:09:01,767 --> 00:09:04,679
'Over to Newbury for the six o'clock. '

120
00:09:06,447 --> 00:09:10,122
You should have listened.
Still, no big thing, eh?

121
00:09:13,607 --> 00:09:17,759
- She drew a line with a big, blue...
- He's useless, he has no idea...

122
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:23,484
Silence! Nobody can speak
unless they're holding... this pencil.

123
00:09:23,527 --> 00:09:26,803
- May I have the pencil? I wish to speak.
- No.

124
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:31,963
Now, it has come
to my attention this morning,

125
00:09:32,007 --> 00:09:37,081
while reviewing my portfolio, that
I cannot afford to pay two employees.

126
00:09:37,127 --> 00:09:41,279
- That's not fair cos...
- An interesting situation.

127
00:09:43,407 --> 00:09:45,523
So, what I'm prepared to do is

128
00:09:45,567 --> 00:09:49,560
you can have a week in which
to sell as many books as possible.

129
00:09:49,607 --> 00:09:53,600
Whoever sells the most gets to keep
the one job I am offering.

130
00:09:53,647 --> 00:09:58,277
- That's not fair. I would...
- And the most important point is...

131
00:09:58,327 --> 00:10:02,115
Whenever you see me -
I can't stress this enough -

132
00:10:02,167 --> 00:10:06,922
you give me, immediately,
all the money.

133
00:10:06,967 --> 00:10:09,481
He has no idea what money looks like.

134
00:10:09,527 --> 00:10:11,802
She's messing up the whole system.

135
00:10:20,167 --> 00:10:22,965
- Bernard...
- It's not fair because...

136
00:10:41,487 --> 00:10:44,285
- I saw her first.
- The bitch is mine.

137
00:10:44,807 --> 00:10:46,798
Wuh...

138
00:10:48,687 --> 00:10:51,076
Hi. Can I help?

139
00:10:51,127 --> 00:10:55,678
- I'm looking for a light holiday read.
- Perhaps these may appeal.

140
00:10:56,407 --> 00:10:58,637
Browse me.

141
00:11:32,847 --> 00:11:34,838
Money. Now.

142
00:11:43,447 --> 00:11:47,076
It's my interview tomorrow,
so we have to shut the shop.

143
00:11:47,127 --> 00:11:50,244
- It's not fair otherwise.
- Objection!

144
00:11:50,287 --> 00:11:53,359
Upheld. Books must be sold,
money made.

145
00:11:53,407 --> 00:12:00,165
Ha! You're toast. T-O-E-A-R-S-T.
Toearst.

146
00:12:02,727 --> 00:12:04,718
All yours.

147
00:12:04,767 --> 00:12:08,476
- What's the next race?
- There's none. We're closing.

148
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:10,836
I can't stop now, I'm winning.

149
00:12:10,887 --> 00:12:13,879
We'll make our own race,
you against Pat.

150
00:12:13,927 --> 00:12:16,725
I'll put 60 quid on you,
you look nippy.

151
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,644
We're closing.

152
00:12:20,967 --> 00:12:23,481
It's always the same, isn't it?

153
00:12:23,527 --> 00:12:25,757
Just when you break your streak.

154
00:12:26,567 --> 00:12:29,400
- D'you ever play poker?
- Hm? No.

155
00:12:29,447 --> 00:12:32,325
No, I can never remember the rules.

156
00:12:33,287 --> 00:12:36,324
Although... No.

157
00:12:36,367 --> 00:12:40,918
- Shame. There's a game tomorrow.
- Really? Where? Near? Far? Where?

158
00:12:42,287 --> 00:12:44,721
Just... You know Dante's mini-cabs?

159
00:12:44,767 --> 00:12:47,759
- Yeah.
- It's big money. 9am.

160
00:12:47,807 --> 00:12:49,798
I'll see you there.

161
00:12:57,007 --> 00:12:59,362
- Who knows how to play poker?
- Me.

162
00:12:59,407 --> 00:13:02,843
You're gonna teach me.
I've got 12 hours to learn.

163
00:13:02,887 --> 00:13:05,242
- Who's got cards?
- Me. In my room.

164
00:13:05,287 --> 00:13:07,278
Good. You can play as well.

165
00:13:07,327 --> 00:13:09,602
- Who's doing nothing?
- Me.

166
00:13:09,647 --> 00:13:11,956
Good. You can fetch the cards.

167
00:13:12,007 --> 00:13:15,886
And then... I have spoken!

168
00:13:21,727 --> 00:13:24,116
OK, the first thing about poker...

169
00:13:24,167 --> 00:13:28,160
Wait. We need whisky,
like in the movies. And background jazz.

170
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:30,277
You. Mr guy. Whisky, jazz.

171
00:13:32,727 --> 00:13:38,006
Right. I've got a seven, a two,
two queens and a nine.

172
00:13:38,047 --> 00:13:40,402
Well, I've got... an ace.

173
00:13:41,327 --> 00:13:43,443
- And?
- And a king.

174
00:13:43,487 --> 00:13:45,478
And a two. And a seven.

175
00:13:45,527 --> 00:13:48,439
And... Mrs Bun, the baker's wife.

176
00:14:02,887 --> 00:14:07,278
- We'll say Mrs Bun is another ace.
- Hah! I win.

177
00:14:08,087 --> 00:14:11,443
- No, I win. Three of a kind.
- What's that?

178
00:14:11,487 --> 00:14:14,479
A pair, two pair,
three of a kind, a run, a flush,

179
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:17,564
full house, four of a kind,
straight flush, royal flush.

180
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:20,679
- How do you know all that?
- My grandad taught me.

181
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:24,640
Then my granny taught me how to cheat.
Before she got shot in Reno.

182
00:14:24,687 --> 00:14:30,319
- Teach me to cheat. It's quicker.
- It's not. You have to rig the deck.

183
00:14:43,607 --> 00:14:46,679
- You try.
- Yeah, well.

184
00:14:46,727 --> 00:14:49,480
That looked pretty easy, actually.

185
00:14:51,167 --> 00:14:53,442
Pull that and...

186
00:15:29,487 --> 00:15:31,478
Bernard. In you come.

187
00:15:32,647 --> 00:15:34,717
Everyone, this is Bernard.

188
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,122
Bernard, this is everyone.

189
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:39,522
This is Mickey "One Eye" Swayne.

190
00:15:39,567 --> 00:15:41,637
"Undertaker" Jones.

191
00:15:41,687 --> 00:15:45,077
- Lily "The Dazzler" Thompson.
- Hello.

192
00:15:45,127 --> 00:15:49,405
Jimmy "The Illustrated, Blind, Solid
Silver Bitch" Stakopopolips III.

193
00:15:50,727 --> 00:15:54,720
- Oh. Right.
- And Dave "Mouse Ear" Smith.

194
00:16:01,007 --> 00:16:04,682
Dealer's choice.
We're playing Lebanese Southern Cross.

195
00:16:04,727 --> 00:16:08,276
40/80 the ante, fives and twos are wilds.
No raising before the button.

196
00:16:08,327 --> 00:16:12,320
I don't want any show-boating,
coffee-housing, auntie's drawers.

197
00:16:12,367 --> 00:16:16,440
Minimum three aces to start.
Minimum bet one ton. Let's play.

198
00:16:18,367 --> 00:16:22,360
- I don't know if I'm ready for this.
- Just be sure I can see your cards.

199
00:16:22,407 --> 00:16:25,558
- I'll tell you when to bet.
- Would you?

200
00:16:27,127 --> 00:16:29,687
Thanks very much. Call again.

201
00:16:32,887 --> 00:16:35,401
Ah. Did you win or lose?

202
00:16:35,447 --> 00:16:37,517
It's hard to say.

203
00:16:37,567 --> 00:16:40,877
All right. Have you got
more money or less money?

204
00:16:40,927 --> 00:16:44,442
- That's complicated.
- You've got no money.

205
00:16:44,487 --> 00:16:45,886
Yeah.

206
00:16:47,127 --> 00:16:49,687
- What is the problem?
- No problem.

207
00:16:49,727 --> 00:16:54,596
If you want to put on a bet of one pound,
I'll be glad to accept that bet.

208
00:16:54,647 --> 00:16:57,525
As soon as you can find the other 93p.

209
00:17:01,407 --> 00:17:04,399
Bernard. Next game, three o'clock today.

210
00:17:04,447 --> 00:17:06,483
Forget it, I'm cleaned out.

211
00:17:06,527 --> 00:17:08,597
That's no big thing.

212
00:17:08,647 --> 00:17:13,198
Let's nip to my office, have a diet yogurt
and maybe I can help you out.

213
00:17:13,247 --> 00:17:15,886
No, I couldn't do that. No.

214
00:17:24,567 --> 00:17:28,480
- The thing is, mate, you need a bankroll.
- Yeah, I had some good cards.

215
00:17:28,527 --> 00:17:31,724
Just not in the right hand
or in the right order.

216
00:17:31,767 --> 00:17:35,760
Your moves were amazing. You kept
on losing but you kept on going.

217
00:17:35,807 --> 00:17:39,356
That's what makes a gambler.
That crowd were scared.

218
00:17:39,407 --> 00:17:42,399
- They've already got a nickname for you.
- Really?

219
00:17:42,447 --> 00:17:44,438
Usually it takes years.

220
00:17:44,487 --> 00:17:47,240
- What, like Tex or Doc or...?
- No.

221
00:17:47,287 --> 00:17:50,518
They call you The Gold Mine.

222
00:17:52,287 --> 00:17:55,802
Bernard, I can help you
but I need some cover.

223
00:17:55,847 --> 00:17:58,077
I don't have a car or anything.

224
00:17:58,127 --> 00:18:02,120
- Any stock or business concern?
- No. I...

225
00:18:02,927 --> 00:18:05,441
I dunno. A shop?

226
00:18:06,247 --> 00:18:08,522
Would... would a shop do?

227
00:18:08,567 --> 00:18:12,719
Well, seeing as it's you... sign there.

228
00:18:14,447 --> 00:18:16,722
How much should I borrow? Thousand?

229
00:18:16,767 --> 00:18:20,726
- Or 10,000.
- Or 10... 10,000.

230
00:18:29,367 --> 00:18:33,838
- Oh.
- We're closed. Oh, it's you. Sorry.

231
00:18:33,887 --> 00:18:36,117
Why aren't you selling books?

232
00:18:36,167 --> 00:18:38,442
My head'll explode if we do.

233
00:18:42,327 --> 00:18:44,636
You know what Bernard's done?

234
00:18:44,687 --> 00:18:46,962
He's played us off against each other

235
00:18:47,007 --> 00:18:50,317
- to feed his filthy habit.
- You're right.

236
00:18:50,367 --> 00:18:54,440
- How was the job interview?
- Oh, un... brilliant.

237
00:18:54,487 --> 00:18:58,526
Staying awake till 8am
drinking whisky and teaching poker

238
00:18:58,567 --> 00:19:00,842
was not strictly tactical.

239
00:19:00,887 --> 00:19:03,526
I fell asleep in the lobby.

240
00:19:03,567 --> 00:19:07,799
At least you didn't punch anyone
and puke up in your handbag.

241
00:19:18,847 --> 00:19:21,077
- Fold.
- Call.

242
00:19:23,047 --> 00:19:25,038
Hm.

243
00:19:26,487 --> 00:19:30,241
OK. A th... th... thousand.

244
00:19:32,047 --> 00:19:34,720
- Call it.
- Fold.

245
00:19:36,487 --> 00:19:40,082
- I'll call your grand.
- I'll call.

246
00:19:40,127 --> 00:19:42,118
Fold.

247
00:19:42,167 --> 00:19:44,362
Call.

248
00:19:49,407 --> 00:19:51,921
So, what have you got, big boy?

249
00:19:51,967 --> 00:19:54,197
These ones.

250
00:19:57,207 --> 00:20:00,722
They won't beat a full house,
aces on sevens.

251
00:20:06,127 --> 00:20:09,039
- Unlucky, Mouse.
- You out, then?

252
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:12,716
- No. Can you front me another 100?
- Piss off.

253
00:20:12,767 --> 00:20:15,361
- Come on, a hundred quid.
- No.

254
00:20:15,407 --> 00:20:19,605
You're out of the game now, Bernard.
You've got six hours to pay.

255
00:20:20,407 --> 00:20:25,322
So, it's the ten grand
plus 100%/% interest. That's 20.

256
00:20:25,367 --> 00:20:28,518
Or your shop. Or your legs.

257
00:20:39,487 --> 00:20:43,480
You know what'll happen?
He'll come in and he'll say...

258
00:20:43,527 --> 00:20:46,519
"Fran, Manny, help me. I'm in trouble. "

259
00:20:49,247 --> 00:20:53,001
- Fran, Manny, help me...
- Hi. Are you in trouble?

260
00:20:53,047 --> 00:20:56,835
Yeah. I have to find... 20 grand.

261
00:20:56,887 --> 00:20:58,878
In the next six hours.

262
00:20:58,927 --> 00:21:03,205
Or, er, get evicted from my shop.

263
00:21:03,247 --> 00:21:05,886
Or my legs. Erm...

264
00:21:05,927 --> 00:21:09,715
So don't... For now we'll just think.
We'll think...

265
00:21:09,767 --> 00:21:12,076
You happy now? We found it again.

266
00:21:12,127 --> 00:21:14,800
I don't like this book. I want a refund.

267
00:21:14,847 --> 00:21:18,999
No. Go away, we're closed!
Bugger off back to Australia!

268
00:21:22,087 --> 00:21:24,078
What am I gonna do?

269
00:21:24,127 --> 00:21:28,405
Manny, d'you still have those funny
sunglasses you got in Whitstable?

270
00:21:28,447 --> 00:21:31,644
Yeah, in the bathroom.
You think they're funny?

271
00:21:31,687 --> 00:21:33,962
I'm gonna be homeless. And short.

272
00:21:34,007 --> 00:21:36,885
- And you're chatting!
- Relax.

273
00:21:36,927 --> 00:21:39,122
Everything's gonna be fine.

274
00:21:44,807 --> 00:21:47,958
Look, a real English bookie's.

275
00:21:48,007 --> 00:21:51,761
You happy now?
All day long in Madame Tussaud's.

276
00:21:51,807 --> 00:21:54,799
I miss the action, yadda-yadda.

277
00:21:54,847 --> 00:21:59,875
What's this? This is no good.
What is this with the tiny televisions?

278
00:21:59,927 --> 00:22:02,600
Let's go someplace we can play cards.

279
00:22:02,647 --> 00:22:05,559
Why d'you wanna play cards? You lose.

280
00:22:05,607 --> 00:22:09,520
Ah, come on. I saw The Tower,
the goddamn queen.

281
00:22:09,567 --> 00:22:12,684
Hello. Sorry, I couldn't help overhearing.

282
00:22:12,727 --> 00:22:16,720
If you're interested,
there is a little game on this afternoon.

283
00:22:16,767 --> 00:22:20,282
Anything. Anything to make him shut up.

284
00:22:20,327 --> 00:22:23,558
Could I sit in to see
he doesn't lose too much?

285
00:22:23,607 --> 00:22:25,598
100 grand here, 100 grand there...

286
00:22:25,647 --> 00:22:28,639
- It adds up.
- That's not a problem.

287
00:22:37,007 --> 00:22:42,479
OK, you can have this on one condition.
You never... gamble again.

288
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:46,076
- OK, I won't. Give, give.
- Uh-uh-uh.

289
00:22:46,127 --> 00:22:50,279
You must swear that from now on
you will lead a wholesome life.

290
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:54,764
You will stick to a modest range
of breakfast wines.

291
00:22:54,807 --> 00:22:58,083
At table, you will use
at least a knife and a fork.

292
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:02,723
And your hand will fondle
not card nor dice nor the gelding.

293
00:23:02,767 --> 00:23:07,522
OK, OK. I swear! Can you come on?
I've got about 20 minutes

294
00:23:07,567 --> 00:23:11,606
before I'm scratching my stumps
in a cardboard box.

295
00:23:12,847 --> 00:23:16,965
Can I just say you were fantastic
back there?

296
00:23:17,007 --> 00:23:20,477
- Really? No, you were the star.
- No, you were.

297
00:23:20,527 --> 00:23:24,566
When I said, "What's that big,
famous clock by the river?"

298
00:23:24,607 --> 00:23:27,997
- And you said...
- I said, "You know, Big Bill. "

299
00:23:28,047 --> 00:23:30,038
That was class.

300
00:23:30,087 --> 00:23:33,875
And you, don't blow it, OK?
Just act casual.

301
00:23:33,927 --> 00:23:37,283
They don't call me The Gold Mine
for nothing.

302
00:23:39,927 --> 00:23:43,602
19,980, 20,000. All there.

303
00:23:44,407 --> 00:23:48,719
- Er... where'd you get it all from?
