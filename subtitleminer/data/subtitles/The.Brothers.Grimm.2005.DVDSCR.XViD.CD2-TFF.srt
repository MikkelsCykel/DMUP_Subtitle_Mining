00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,480
The story, it's happening to us now.

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:06,400
We're living it.
It's alive, it's real, it's breathing.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,200
And we can give it a happy ending.

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,480
Jake...

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,520
Angelika, we'll find your sisters.
All right? We'll bring them back.

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,760
Bring back her sisters?

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,080
Bring them back?

8
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,440
Bring them back with what?
Magic beans?

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,560
- Why do you say that?
- Magic beans don't work!

10
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,320
They don't bring people back to life.
They did not then and they will not now.

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,480
You go wait by the horses.

12
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,800
Jacob, wait by the horses.

13
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:47,440
- Sorry.
- He was doing what he thinks is right, Will.

14
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,360
He was trying to help.

15
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,320
- We can not fight the entire forest.
- You're just scared.

16
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,000
Just scared?

17
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,440
I'm terrified.
You should be too.

18
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,280
Don't you understand? The idea of going
back in there - nothing makes sense there.

19
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,560
It's like being inside Jake's head.

20
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,960
God, I hate him.
He makes me...

21
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,960
He drives me mad.

22
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,680
He makes you feel weak, doesn't he?

23
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,640
Yeah. He always has done.

24
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,440
The thing is, I can't...

25
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,520
Protect him.

26
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,200
My father thought
he could protect his family too, Will.

27

<i>(clears throat)</i>

28
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,280
Pah!

29
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,320
Jake. Jacob, come back.

30
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,080
Jake!

31
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,400
Come back, Jake!

32
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,360
You're a fool!

33
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,520
Now do you see?
I made that armor.

34
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,120
It's not magic, it's just shiny.

35
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,920
Oh, no!

36
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:17,400
This lovely <i>Fräulein</i>
will not be coming with you, <i>caro</i> storyboy.

37
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,000
She will be staying here with me.

38
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,960
It's all right, Will.
Just go. Go.

39
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,640
<i>(Jake)</i> What's this?
It's a mess, that's what it is.

40
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,360
It was hardly a snap, was it?

41
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,440
- More tension in the snap board.
- <i>(Bunst moans)</i>

42
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,280
- We need the trunks here now.
- What do you suppose I'm doing?

43
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:50,040
And this is the last time I'll ask you,
is the chuck basket secure?

44
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,080
- Yes, it's secure.
- It's secure.

45
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,040
Cor!

46
00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:00,760
So, if we find these 11 girls,
we don't get guillotined.

47
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,360
Can you believe, these bumpkins actually
think they were devoured by the forest?

48
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,360
- <i>(Bunst chuckles)</i>
- <i>(creaking)</i>

49
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,040
And what exactly do we think?

50
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,560
<i>(snapping and strange noises)</i>

51
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,240
- <i>(Jake)</i> All right. Positions, lads.
- Jake?

52
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,880
- <i>(Jake)</i> Check for takeoff.
- Jake!

53
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,200
- <i>(Jake)</i> Right, you ready? Steady it.
- Jake!

54
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,400
<i>(Jake)</i> And three, two, one. Takeoff.

55
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,680
- Woo-hoo!
- No!

56
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,360
Gargh! Oh!

57
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,600
Jake? Jake?

58
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,720
Jake?

59
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,680
Jacob?

60
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,200
<i>(Jake)</i> Dammit. Every time.

61
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,400
We need more height. And can we check
the alignment? The alignment is crucial.

62
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,880
Stop this now, Jacob.
You're going to kill yourself.

63
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,560
Oh, good. That's just great,
because then it will just be you, Will,

64
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,560
and you can have anything
and everything that you want.

65
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,880
What is it exactly you do want, Will, huh?

66
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,080
What? Is it Angelika?
You want her?

67
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,960
Fine. Take her, she's yours.

68
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:14,880
Is it the money? Take that. That's all you
seem to do these days, is take and take.

69
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,960
Jacob Grimm, you petulant child!

70
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,600
Argh! Oh!

71
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,760
- Ow!
- <i>(creaking)</i>

72
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,160
What was that? Something moved.
I saw something move. Did you?

73
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:33,040
D-d-d-don't ask.
Please don't ask me to look.

74
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:40,560
All my life I've studied these folk tales, Will,
and now I find one that's for real.

75
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,560
It's not beans.

76
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,520
It's real.

77
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,080
I mean, don't you understand?

78
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,640
I have to do this.

79
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,320
Ow! Agh!

80
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,280
All right, Jake.

81
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,720
What do you want me to do?

82
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,800
What? Honestly?

83
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,000
You're my brother.

84
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,320
I want you to believe in me.

85
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,640
I need you to help me.

86
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,440
All right, lads. Let's launch me off
into the flaming belly of hell.

87
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,280
Wait. I think you're overcomplicating it.

88
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,200
- What?
- A catapult's not gonna work.

89
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,640
Yeah, you're right.

90
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,760
- What other gear do we have?
- Uh...

91
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,480
- Huh!
- Well, there's the...

92
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:40,440
What about the flying-witch rig, with
a grapple and a hook to catch the window?

93
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,800
- Yeah.
- Good idea.

94
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,040
We haven't got a hook and grapple.

95
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,560
They'll have hooks at the village.
We'll ride like the wind.

96
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,960
- Will, we've got the hooks, right?
- We'll be no time at all.

97
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,640
No, I've got it.

98
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,160
Huh!

99
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,120
Oh, great!

100
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,200
This is suicide.

101
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,200
Probably.

Honest labor.

Uh... Will!

150
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,240
Will, it's strange,
there's twelve crypts.

151
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,880
And they're evenly spaced in a circle.

152

Yeah, it's like a clock face.

Easy. Easy.

All right, Will.
I'm going in, Will.

He's going in.

What's this? It's a crown.

It's a book of spells. Huh.

That's the blood moon.

I'll just try to be gentle.

Am I still the fairest of them all?

Tell me I am the fairest of them all.

Angelika?

You love her,

He doesn't love her.

Good timing. Nice disguise.

She's still there, Will.
She's still alive. She's up in the tower.

220
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,920
- For 500 years?
- Yeah, but they haven't been kind.

00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,240
- Grab the ax.
- Huh? Right.

222
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,920
They tricked her, Will.
They tricked her.

223
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,840
Because she has the spell for eternal life,
but not for youth, not youth.

224
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,880
So she'll rot for eternity, waiting for
someone to come and rescue her.

- Come on.
- Was that Sasha?

- It's this way, Will.
- No, no, it's not.

227
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,880
- It's that way. Grandmother Toad told me.
- What?

228
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,640
Trust the toad!

Come on!

230
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,480
Stand aside, Will.

231
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,280
It's the ax, Will.
It's enchanted as well.

232
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,240
Stop them!

233
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,240

She's not breathing.

239
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,840
- How can she not be breathing?
- It's impossible. I saw her walk.

240
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,080
There's no breath.
No pulse.

241

- Sasha.
- Cursed forever!

242

It has to do with the eclipse.

Listen to me.
We know why your forest is enchanted.

249
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,960
It's under the power of
the Thuringian queen.

250
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,760
She's stolen your girls for their youth,
for their beauty.

251
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,840
She needs twelve.
Sasha was meant to be the twelfth.

252
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,080
The queen needs one more
to make her spell work.

You're right. Clear out these children.
Get them to Malsburg or Frankfurt.

why were two compatriots of these men

And why would they not stop telling tales

These Grimms are thieves and liars.

Every demon they have killed
they have created.

00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,240
Look.

497
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,360
See? Hurry, Jacob.

498
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,600
The spell can be broken with a kiss...

499
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:55,640
- Yes, a kiss. A kiss, yes.
...of true love.

500
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:03,440
Make sure, in your heart, true love.

501
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:10,680
Or the kiss will be the kiss of death.

502
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,360
<i>(gasps)</i>

503
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:57,560
Yes.

504
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:08,520
- <i>(child #1)</i> Eva!
- <i>(child #</i>2 <i>)</i> Heidi!

505
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:09,920
<i>(Cavaldi)</i> Bingo!

506
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,800
- Lily!
- Elsie!

507
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:14,200
Angelika!

508
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:17,080
- Will.
- Hurry, <i>bambini</i>. Hurry.

509
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:25,520
Will. Come on, it's over now.
You can get up.

510
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,800
Will, the spell's broken.

511
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,920
Will?

512
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,040
We did it.

513
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,520
Will?

514
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,240
Will.

515
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:41,320
<i>(Cavaldi)</i> Perhaps another kiss.

516
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:49,280
Not you.

517
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,240
Hm?

518
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,240
Maybe you should give it a try, Angelika.

519
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:13,360
<i>(children laugh)</i>

520
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:17,040
I just had to know what that was like
before the story ended.

521
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:17,520
Will!

522
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:20,720
<i>(villagers cheer)</i>

523
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:23,720
<i>(children scream excitedly)</i>

524
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:35,960
Good people of Marbaden,
you have nothing further to fear,

525
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:39,360
because I and the Grimmies,

526
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:44,640
we have destroyed the dark heart of evil.

527
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,960
You are free!

528
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,600
<i>Grazie! Musica!</i>

529
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:53,600
<i>(German folk dance)</i>

530
00:46:56,360 --> 00:47:00,040
I would like to keep this.
It saved my life.

531
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,600
- Of course.
- <i>Grazie.</i>

532
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:05,000
And this, you should be
more careful about this.

533
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:08,920
- It's very good, but I think it'II...
- <i>(Jake)</i> Is that mine?

534
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:22,360
- Sorry I never believed in you.
- Well, I never believed in you either.

535
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,320
So you <i>are</i> brothers.

536
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:37,040
You're welcome here any time,
any time at all, Grimms. This is your home.

537
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:42,560
- I thought you ended up with the girl.
- You see that?

538
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,240
What? The sun?

539
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,400
- The day's not over yet.
- Yeah, right!

540
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:54,720
- Would you call this a turning point?
- I'd say we're on the verge.

541
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,400
- Really?
- The verge, Will.

542
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,240
That's fantastic.

543
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:01,280
Cos I've been thinking
of an alternative career path.

544
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,680
- One that uses all of our new expertise.
- Will.

545
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:06,480
- I haven't sorted it yet...
- Will, this is the real world.

546
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:09,440
We're men without a country,
we're enemies of the state,

547
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:11,720
and worst of all we haven't a single bean.

548
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:15,360
- It's a good name, though, isn't it?
- It's a damn good name.

549
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:17,440
Let's dance. Come on.

550
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,280
