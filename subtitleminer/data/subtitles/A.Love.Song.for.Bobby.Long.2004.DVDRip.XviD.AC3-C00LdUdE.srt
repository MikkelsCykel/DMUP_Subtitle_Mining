00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:27,780
What are you doing here?

2
00:01:27,887 --> 00:01:30,822
Georgianna went a half hour ago.
You're gonna miss it.

3
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,619
Put that on my tab.

4
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:34,825
Your bill.

5
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:37,862
"Tab" sounds like
y'all might pay it someday.

6
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:29,640
<i>Time was never a friend to Bobby Long.</i>

7
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:32,303
<i>It would conspire against him...</i>

8
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:36,781
<i>allow him to believe in a generous nature,</i>
<i>then rob him blind every time.</i>

9
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:44,452
<i>We had lost Lorraine, all of us...</i>

10
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,749
<i>but long before she died.</i>

11
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:02,601
You can't park here.
You'll get another ticket.

12
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:05,303
I don't see no signs, Miss Daisy.

13
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:15,686
It's all right.
I can walk to the curb from here.

14
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:19,191
Get me a beer.

15
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,917
You find a job?

16
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:48,250
You clean the fuck up?

17
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:50,953
That Bobby guy called again today.

18
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:56,025
- Again?
- He called a couple of days ago, remember?

19
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:58,730
No, you didn't tell me. What did he want?

20
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:02,732
He wanted to tell you about Lorraine.

21
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:05,026
What about her?

22
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:09,238
She died.

23
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:11,406
She what?

24
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:15,378
She's dead, all right? He called
because he thought you'd wanna know.

25
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:18,042
Lorraine died and you didn't tell me?

26
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:23,045
To Lorraine. <i>May she finally find peace.

27
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,587
So, now what?
Lorraine finally kick y'all out?

28
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,358
No.

29
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:40,105
She never would.
Besides, God wouldn't let that happen.

30
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:43,139
Really? And why not?

31
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:47,769
'Cause God knows me, and I know God.

32
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:49,839
Go.

33
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,875
Cecil's pretty torn up. <i>Make sure he eats.

34
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:55,554
I'll see you later.

35
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:02,417
She never meant nothing to you...

36
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:06,363
and you didn't mean a damn thing to her.
I didn't think you would care.

37
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,130
Come on, baby, stop.

38
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:14,367
Look, I'm sorry, all right?

39
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:18,671
Why don't you just cook me some dinner
and I'll go rent us a porno?

40
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:20,679
I have to go to a funeral, Lee...

41
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:24,046
unless I missed it
because you forgot to tell me...

42
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:28,554
that my mother is dead!
Fucking asshole. I am so out of here.

43
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:30,384
She was never your mother!

44
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:39,556
<i>Purslane? This is Bobby Long again.</i>

45
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:42,062
I don't know if you remember me...

46
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:48,099
but you missed your mama's funeral.

47
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:50,869
So long.

48
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:53,678
You got any smokes?

49
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:55,640
Sorry, sir.

50
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:01,980
- Y'all going down to Cecil's?
- In a minute.

51
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:04,682
- I'll see you guys.
- See you there.

52
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:07,923
You got a light?

53
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:10,485
- I thought you didn't have any.
- I don't.

54
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,027
Not for Junior.

55
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:17,895
He's got to cut down.
He's got fierce emphysema.

56
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:22,096
That cough sends shivers of mortality
down my spine.

57
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:25,974
"He'd make a lovely corpse,"
but I'll make no contribution.

58
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:29,648
Of course not. "Contribute only
to one's own death." That's my motto.

59
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:31,876
Did you get the girl? She know anything?

60
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:35,352
- "He'd make a lovely corpse."
- Come on, man. Charles Dickens.

61
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:38,315
Are you serious? It's <i>Martin Chuzzlewit.</i>

62
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:39,986
Smart-ass.

63
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:47,131
<i>New Orleans is a siren of a city.</i>

64
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,999
<i>A place of fables and illusion.</i>

65
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,495
<i>A place Lorraine had to escape from...</i>

66
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:56,064
<i>and Bobby and I had to escape to.</i>

67
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,970
<i>Away from Alabama...</i>

68
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:01,236
<i>away from lives</i>
<i>that no longer belonged to us.</i>

69
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:08,578
I thought she was getting better
that last time, I really did.

70
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,550
When was that?

71
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:14,220
- A few years ago, at least.
- It'll be six years, October.

72
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:16,727
Was it that long since we seen her?

73
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:18,263
Since you seen her.

74
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:23,228
We should have gone
to the hospital with you.

75
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:25,862
You should have done a lot of things.

76
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:45,543
Coming.

77
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:53,816
This Lorraine's house?

78
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,521
And who are you?

79
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:01,657
No one. I just live here.

80
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:06,066
Come on in.

81
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:18,943
Nice place.

82
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:22,484
Thanks. We try.

83
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:30,756
- You're not old enough to be Bobby.
- That's because I'm Lawson.

84
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:34,655
Okay.

85
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:41,338
I'm sorry about your mother.
You look a lot like her.

86
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:47,239
Sorry to wake you so early. It's barely noon.

87
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:54,375
Bobby. We got company, man. Wake up!

88
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:59,157
Honey, put your bags down. We don't bite.

89
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,058
- Juice?
- No.

90
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:06,531
<i>- B</i>obby, get up. She's here.
- Who?

91
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:08,226
- Pursey.
- Who?

92
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:10,368
The girl is here. Get up.

93
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:17,404
So, when's the funeral?

94
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:22,479
It was yesterday. It was real nice.

95
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:25,148
You should have been there, young lady.

96
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:27,708
That's your opinion.

97
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:30,819
You must be here for some reason.

98
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:35,589
I guess you already know
the deal on the house.

99
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:37,221
What deal?

100
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:41,024
- The house. Your mother owned it...
- The deal!

101
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:43,697
Let me tell you what the deal is.

102
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:47,136
The deal is that
Lorraine left the three of us the house.

103
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:50,573
Lawson and I are two-thirds,
and you are only one-third.

104
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:53,705
She did what?

105
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:56,611
Lawson and I have been living here
for some time.

106
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:59,082
Your mother hasn't lived here for years.

107
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:03,118
And I don't believe
that she thought you'd be interested.

108
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:05,521
Lorraine was great at being wrong.

109
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:11,186
Purslane, honey, we are here to stay.
This is our home.

110
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:13,292
It's no big deal...

111
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:17,893
Lorraine thinking I'd share this shithole
with two alcoholic strangers.

112
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:21,472
You are alcoholics, aren't you?

113
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,031
But we are not strangers.
We were her friends.

114
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,737
We took care of her.

115
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:30,075
And this shithole is just fine for us.

116
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:33,683
It's not suited for a girl like you.

117
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:38,554
I'm getting up out of bed now.
You can watch if you want.

118
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:40,489
It don't matter to me.

119
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:44,262
It seems hard to believe...

120
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:47,659
that you haven't seen a man naked before.

121
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:49,631
Not an old one.

122
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:56,300
I know that you're no innocent...

123
00:12:57,309 --> 00:13:00,437
because I spoke to that boyfriend of yours...

124
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:03,209
over on the Redneck Riviera.

125
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,716
You certainly didn't choose him
for his brains.

126
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,810
You don't know nothing about me.

127
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:13,825
I guess that will change
if we all became roommates, wouldn't it?

128
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:21,222
I'll see you later. I'm out of cigarettes.

129
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,230
My brand is on sale.

130
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,004
Good to see you again, Purslane.

131
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:30,670
All growed up.

132
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:47,892
He's not usually such a jackass.
He's just upset about Lorraine. We all are.

133
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:50,993
He's right, you know. I can't stay here.

134
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:56,032
It's pretty funny, actually.
My grandma was always talking about...

135
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:59,537
the pretty little house
Lorraine was fixing up for me...

136
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:04,967
and I guess
that was the Ernest & Julio talking.

137
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:06,409
It's fine.

138
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:10,713
- There's no real surprises here.
- The hospital sent her stuff.

139
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:15,884
Lorraine would want you to have these.

140
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,482
They went everywhere she did.

141
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,751
She loved those books.

142
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:29,592
I guess I could unload them
at a flea market or something.

143
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:37,106
- Here, I'll help you out.
- No, I'm fine.

144
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:47,049
I really did want to come to the funeral.
I just never got his message.

145
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:02,090
That girl looks so much like Lorraine.

146
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,863
I remember the first time
you took me to see her sing.

147
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:08,133
It was my first time in New Orleans.

148
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:12,774
I was so taken.

149
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:20,986
You were kind of sheltered.

150
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:23,280
Choked by that silver spoon.

151
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:27,482
I thought she was so beautiful.

152
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:29,756
She was.

153
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,593
What else can I get you boys?

154
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:47,901
Did anyone ever tell you that you smell
like a Parisian woman in springtime?

155
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:50,271
Every day, at least once. Y'all gonna eat?

156
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,207
The lawyer could get to her at any time.

157
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:55,269
So what?
The will says we can stay for a year.

158
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:57,476
Should I just come back?

159
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:01,679
Do you know how lethal the smell
of a Parisian woman in springtime is?

160
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:05,483
Not nearly as lethal as
a Louisiana woman who don't give a shit.

161
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:11,293
- Eggs and bacon, ma'am. Both of us.
- Cheese on our grits, darling. Please.

162
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:16,325
You are fucking shameless.

163
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:45,596
Why didn't you use the bed, sweetheart?

164
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:49,293
- Oh, God.
- I could have come in and cuddled with you.

165
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:51,728
That would have been fine with me.

166
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:55,965
- We could have spooned together.
- Save it.

167
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:58,909
Why'd you give her this?

168
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:07,281
This is stories of misfits...

169
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:12,385
invisible people. It's beautiful.

170
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:14,984
Have you ever read it?

171
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:18,459
Have you ever read any book?

172
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:21,826
Lorraine didn't know she was a poet.

173
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:26,232
I really do enjoy...

174
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:28,768
fostering inspiration.

175
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:32,701
Lawson's a writer. A fine one, too.

176
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:33,972
Really?

177
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,141
He's writing a book about me.

178
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,174
That's fascinating.

179
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:42,851
"Chapter 1:
I got up, I got drunk, I passed out.

180
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:47,183
- "Chapter 2: I got up, I got drunk..."
- Lovely and witty.

181
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:50,685
You're an embarrassment of riches,
little girl.

182
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:57,902
Which room is mine?

183
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:02,634
I'll need a place to stay,
and y'all said I had a right.

184
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:06,471
Just figured I'd stay here
until you get fed up and leave.

185
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:08,979
We are never leaving. Never!

186
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:12,847
- And don't even get it in your mind.
- She should have Lorraine's room.

187
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:16,011
- I'll stay out here. I'll bunk with you.
- Okay, fine.

188
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,782
Are you fucking crazy?

189
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:21,792
Better than her poking around
and finding out the truth.

190
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,795
She won't last.
You're gonna make sure of that.

191
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:28,932
Besides, you're always complaining
how your bed is so cold.

192
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:33,070
You're too skinny for me.

193
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:40,609
- So, y'all are really into books?
- They're mostly Bobby's.

194
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:44,340
- That's the plumage of an English professor.
- Him?

195
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:46,880
- A professor?
- Yeah, he was a good one.

196
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:49,379
And you, you're really a writer?

197
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,250
Bobby likes to think I am.

198
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:54,387
These boxes are all Lorraine's, so...

199
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:56,458
So what?

200
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,899
- I knew your mother pretty well.
- How well?

201
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:10,865
She was hard to understand,
but she kept the door to her heart open.

202
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:14,937
The way I heard it,
it was more of a revolving door, wasn't it?

203
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:50,204
Purslane Hominy Will.

204
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,706
How come you know my name?

205
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:56,974
I know a lot about you.

206
00:21:57,716 --> 00:22:01,152
Your mama and I were close
since we were young.

207
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,419
I helped name you.

208
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,685
Your mama thought you were golden...

209
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:10,487
so we named you
after yellow flowers and corn.

210
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:12,085
This is you here:

211
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:18,034
Pretty, golden purslane.

212
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:20,864
Purslane's really a weed, you know.

213
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:24,067
A neighbor told me when I was 9
and I ran over his tomato plants.

214
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:26,303
He said all gardeners hate purslane.

215
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:28,141
Yeah, and dandelions.

216
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:32,912
It doesn't stop kids
from making wishes on them.

217
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:35,519
Purslane's an axillary bloom.

218
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:38,616
It closes up when the sun goes down.

219
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,121
Thanks.

220
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,239
Damn.

221
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:09,583
Last time I saw you, you were teeny.

222
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:17,428
Is there anyone here who doesn't remember
me with Lorraine, or am I the only one?

223
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:21,432
She used to sing here. I was about your age.
She was something.

224
00:23:23,001 --> 00:23:25,902
- I'm so sorry.
- Don't be.

225
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:30,672
I'll have red beans and rice
and a beer, please.

226
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,140
I hear you'll be staying
at Bobby and Lawson's for a while?

227
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:37,147
No, I'll be staying at Lorraine's indefinitely.

228
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:42,477
- Will you be starting school in September?
- No.

229
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:45,421
I don't go to school. I waitress.
You need one?

230
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:47,788
No<i>, j</i>ust me and Uncle Earl.

231
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:53,297
They know you're not going to school?

232
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:57,495
They're all torn up about it. Ranks up there
with being out of vodka and cigarettes.

233
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:04,773
<i>Mother, go make my bed</i>

234
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:07,804
<i>Make it long and narrow</i>

235
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:12,305
<i>My true love died for me yesterday</i>

236
00:24:13,084 --> 00:24:16,611
<i>I shall die for him tomorrow</i>

237
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:22,560
<i>She was buried in the church house yard</i>

238
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:25,822
<i>And he was buried there beside her</i>

239
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:30,094
<i>And from his grave grew roses red</i>

240
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:34,429
<i>From hers grew greenbriers</i>

241
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:40,309
<i>They grew and they grew so very high</i>

242
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:43,503
<i>Till they could grow no higher</i>

243
00:24:44,182 --> 00:24:48,448
<i>And at the top grew a true lover's knot</i>

244
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:54,456
<i>Twined with greenbriers</i>

245
00:24:55,126 --> 00:24:59,859
Y'all, this is Lorraine's daughter, Pursey.
She's gonna stay with us for a while.

246
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:02,892
Come on in.

247
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:05,227
- You grew up real pretty.
- Thank you.

248
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:07,328
<i>Make yourself at home, darling.

249
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:11,608
I'm Ruthie. My gentleman friend, Ray.

250
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:13,840
Here 26 years.

251
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,906
Go on and relax, baby. Drink your beer.

252
00:25:17,382 --> 00:25:18,644
Find anything?

253
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:21,013
I filled out a few applications.

254
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:22,986
You let that fresh young thing
live with you?

255
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:24,646
She's fresh, all right.

256
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:29,557
I remember when there was a new one
every night. Y'all was pussy magnets.

257
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:33,153
Which one of y'all snores
like a goddamn train?

258
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:36,029
Bobby. If he's on his back,
you have to turn him over.

259
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:40,834
I saw this program on the Medical Channel
that you can cure people of snoring...

260
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:43,067
by cutting their throats open.

261
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:53,176
I believe that I do have a story
for you gentlemen.

262
00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:56,112
Quiet. Bobby's gonna tell a story.

263
00:25:56,254 --> 00:26:00,486
When I was growing up, I always hung
around boys a couple years older than me.

264
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:06,124
And this one summer,
I was, I don't know, 10 or 11.

265
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:11,665
And we were doing all the normal things
that boys in Alabama do.

266
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,033
We were fishing...

267
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:17,367
and playing ball,
and swimming, and beating off.

268
00:26:20,178 --> 00:26:24,114
But in addition to these activities
of an innocent childhood...

269
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:27,250
mine included a lot of talk...

270
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:32,314
about this wonderfully
elusive something called pussy.

271
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:35,583
I wasn't sure exactly what it was...

272
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:40,063
but I knew it was magical and very special
because of the way it was spoken about.

273
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,528
Always in a whisper.

274
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:46,897
I'd go through the fields
saying it to myself: "Pussy."

275
00:26:51,576 --> 00:26:53,601
One day, we was all...

276
00:26:54,212 --> 00:26:56,874
playing ball out in a broom sage field.

277
00:26:58,049 --> 00:27:00,847
And up rode Leroy Tuberville.

278
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:06,482
Now, Leroy was
an upstanding delinquent. Twelve.

279
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:11,659
And his shoulders were already broad,
and his fingers were stained with toba<i>cc</i>o.

280
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:16,899
And Leroy, he parked himself casually
by third base, and he went in his pocket...

281
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:21,934
and he pulled out something. He started
throwing it high in the air like that.

282
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,740
And I watched him play it cool...

283
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,643
his mysterious jewel going up and down.

284
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:33,046
I couldn't take it any longer. I had to ask.

285
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:35,245
"What's that you got there, Leroy?"

286
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:37,716
And everyone fell silent.

287
00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:43,087
And Leroy looked at me
with that nasty sideways grin...

288
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:47,828
and he said,
"It's a piece of pussy, Long. My very own."

289
00:27:49,734 --> 00:27:52,328
My face got hot, my breath quickened.

290
00:27:53,938 --> 00:27:58,807
There he was, with this perfect piece of girl,
tossing her up in the air.

291
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:04,112
And I watched, knowing that I had seen God
for the first time.

292
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:06,611
And I wanted her for my very own.

293
00:28:09,788 --> 00:28:13,155
But old Leroy popped his treasure
between his teeth...

294
00:28:13,758 --> 00:28:16,454
jumped on his bike grinning at me,
and rode off...

295
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:19,622
leaving us in a cloud of dust and desire.

296
00:28:20,231 --> 00:28:24,327
And it was in that tormented haze,
at the age of 10...

297
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:27,596
when I dedicated the rest of my life...

298
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:32,502
to finding my very own tiny piece
of love and wonder...

299
00:28:32,944 --> 00:28:35,435
that I could carry with me for eternity.

300
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:41,381
All right, that's it. I'm going home.

301
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:44,718
To Florida?

302
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:48,986
Now, look, be careful.

303
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:52,161
"We cannot tear out
a single page of our lives...

304
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,858
"but we can throw
the whole book in the fire."

305
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:57,424
George Sand.

306
00:28:57,669 --> 00:29:00,137
I thought that would be a hard one.

307
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:06,173
I don't feel right about lying to her.

308
00:29:08,012 --> 00:29:11,345
What would a teenage hussy want
with this place, anyway?

309
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:15,284
Said herself it was a shithole.
She's better off.

310
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:20,586
Besides, when you sell that book,
everything will change...

311
00:29:20,658 --> 00:29:21,852
Change?

312
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:26,263
We'll go to Paris, drink '61 Latour...

313
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:29,767
write bad poetry.
Yes, everything will be just perfect.

314
00:29:37,742 --> 00:29:42,236
"We die only once,
and for such a long time."

315
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:47,712
Moliére.

316
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:54,623
She's here, honey.

317
00:29:57,562 --> 00:29:59,928
I'll take better care of her this time.

318
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:09,067
See you tomorrow, darling.

319
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:20,543
Your mama used to come here a lot.

320
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:25,452
Why do you talk about her so much?

321
00:30:27,025 --> 00:30:28,822
Because I miss her, I guess.

322
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:32,694
Were you in love with her or something?

323
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:36,793
We all loved her.

324
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:42,763
- She knew how to reach people, you know?
- No, not really.

325
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:45,473
The night before my grandma died...

326
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:48,478
she warned me that
Lorraine would always be selfish.

327
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:51,313
She finally told me about my father.

328
00:30:53,451 --> 00:30:54,816
She did, did she?

329
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:57,311
Some sax player in Memphis.

330
00:30:58,056 --> 00:30:59,990
Pretty much a one-night stand.

331
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:06,360
I think Gran wanted me to know that when
she was gone, I'd be totally on my own.

332
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:08,496
She was right.

333
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:11,966
After she died,
I hardly ever heard from Lorraine.

334
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:14,571
Never even got a chance to hear her sing.

335
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:18,608
Your mama loved you, you know?
You meant the world to her.

336
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:30,254
She used to sit
right where you're sitting now.

337
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:31,954
Always writing.

338
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,957
Called this granddaddy the Tree of Life.

339
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:37,317
That's so corny.

340
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:52,970
- You're in the wrong appliance.
- What?

341
00:31:54,212 --> 00:31:57,704
To su<i>cc</i>eed in killing oneself,
one must be in the oven.

342
00:31:58,316 --> 00:32:01,376
God damn, girl. You woke up productive.

343
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:08,516
- Come see what Pursey did.
- Christ. Stop yelling.

344
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:14,188
I see what she didn't do: Leave.

345
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,561
She ain't gonna leave.

346
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:21,603
That's a really good look for you, too.

347
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,248
Good morning to y'all, too.

348
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:37,710
No school, I hear. What, you skip a grade?

349
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:41,884
A few. The 10th, 11th, and 12th.
Do you mind?

350
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:46,056
God, we are living under the same roof
as a goddamn dropout.

351
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:49,630
It takes one to mock one.
At least I can support myself.

352
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:54,195
Look, as long as
you're not lazing around here...

353
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:58,709
making Lawson lose his concentration,
I do not care what you do.

354
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:04,971
You got work to do.

355
00:33:05,249 --> 00:33:08,116
Do you have to go after her
like that, relentlessly?

356
00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:10,780
Do you want her to stick around?
Is that what you want?

357
00:33:10,855 --> 00:33:15,315
Has it ever o<i>cc</i>urred to you that if we help
her get on her feet, she might move on?

358
00:33:15,526 --> 00:33:17,084
How help her?

359
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:21,025
You want to help her out of
them tight little pants. That's what you want.

360
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:23,533
- Forget it, man, all right?
- Forgotten.

361
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:31,738
<i>A New Orleans summer</i>
<i>drowns in thick, dank stillness.</i>

362
00:33:40,451 --> 00:33:42,351
Come on, man, let's play gin.

363
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:45,389
- Can't you see us doing something here?
- To hell with you.

364
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:50,120
<i>Lorraine's house shrank with each</i>
<i>passing day, straining uneasy walls closer.</i>

365
00:34:01,572 --> 00:34:05,008
Turn that music off, girl!
Can't you see he's working?

366
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:20,650
Jesus H. Christ.

367
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:24,718
How long you gonna sit around here
smoking up our cigarette money?

368
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,693
Lawson said he didn't mind.

369
00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:31,095
Lawson's cigarettes are red. Mine are green.

370
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:34,529
You may not smoke green. Bobby's.

371
00:34:42,647 --> 00:34:46,174
What is that shit you are drinking?
God, it reeks.

372
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:48,715
This is beer and tomato juice.

373
00:34:48,953 --> 00:34:50,887
Breakfast of champions.

374
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:55,521
Champion fuckup, maybe.

375
00:34:56,194 --> 00:34:59,891
You know, girl, I have had
just about enough of your bad attitude.

376
00:35:00,665 --> 00:35:04,260
Whether you like it or not,
I am the senior male in this house...

377
00:35:04,335 --> 00:35:06,200
and you will respect me!

378
00:35:09,006 --> 00:35:12,407
We have been very patient
out of respect for Lorraine...

379
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:15,638
but you will not continue
to lay around here...

380
00:35:15,713 --> 00:35:18,147
and play parasite to our generosity.

381
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:22,577
Now, you must work
as if you're gonna live 100 years...

382
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:26,122
and pray as if you're gonna die tomorrow.

383
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:29,387
- What did you say?
<i>- B</i>en Franklin said it.

384
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,724
It probably meant something
coming from him.

385
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:34,162
You know damn well
I've been looking for a job.

386
00:35:34,232 --> 00:35:38,362
God, what do you do? Except shit around
and talk about how smart you used to be.

387
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:41,667
I am a professor. I am a troubadour. A poet.

388
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:44,435
And it's none of your damn business
how we live.

389
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:47,740
- You are responsible for your share.
<i>- M</i>y share?

390
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,575
You already live in my house for free.

391
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:52,047
- God, you should be grateful...
- This is our house!

392
00:35:52,116 --> 00:35:54,846
<i>Maybe you'd rather I earn money
bringing friends home.

393
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:58,320
Didn't Lorraine have to do that for a while?
Most junkies do.

394
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:01,118
God damn it!

395
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:03,285
Have you no respect for the dead?

396
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:05,822
That was your mother, Pursey.

397
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:13,134
Besides...

398
00:36:14,872 --> 00:36:17,602
we all know
that you ain't no angel of purity...

399
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:20,501
are you, little Purslane?

400
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,647
Did you ever have two men at once?
Have you?

401
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:29,447
That would buy a lot of cigarettes
in our house. It would, wouldn't it?

402
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,317
Fuck you!

403
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:35,587
You're supposed to be the senior male?
The grownup.

404
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:39,027
I'm just a girl. Don't you get that?

405
00:36:39,096 --> 00:36:43,260
I'm so sick of your high and mighty attitude
about poor, dead Lorraine.

406
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:46,201
You wanna teach me about respect?
Who respects you?

407
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:50,969
The wife who's smart enough to get rid
of you, or the kids you never fucking see?

408
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:54,505
What did I tell you about her?

409
00:36:56,113 --> 00:36:58,047
Oh, God!

410
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:57,430
You know, I know what y'all think of me.

411
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:01,737
- School just seemed like a waste of time.
- It's not.

412
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:06,416
I know that.
I'm not some dumb kid, you know.

413
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,981
I wanna be normal. It's just not my life.

414
00:38:10,921 --> 00:38:13,253
What is your life? What do you want?

415
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:16,560
If I could do anything?

416
00:38:20,364 --> 00:38:22,059
Promise you won't laugh?

417
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,963
I don't know if I can promise.

418
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:28,836
Well, I thought about maybe working
in a hospital or something...

419
00:38:29,006 --> 00:38:32,032
like being an x-ray technician
or something like that.

420
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:34,033
Okay.

421
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,740
- Can I ask why?
- I don't know.

422
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:42,511
I like the way bones look on a light box.

423
00:38:42,586 --> 00:38:45,885
They're like portraits, but on the inside.

424
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:50,386
I know it does sound totally stupid.

425
00:38:51,195 --> 00:38:53,527
No, it's not stupid.

426
00:39:05,776 --> 00:39:06,868
Hello?

427
00:39:08,112 --> 00:39:11,104
<i>Hello? Is anyone there?</i>

428
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:33,025
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

429
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:35,800
I keep forgetting
there's a woman in the house.

430
00:40:22,486 --> 00:40:23,953
Any sign of him?

431
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:26,649
Listen, Pursey, I need to tell you something.

432
00:40:28,492 --> 00:40:30,483
What, you worried about him?

433
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:37,262
What are you doing today?

434
00:40:37,868 --> 00:40:39,995
I thought I'd go down to the Quarter...

435
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:42,595
Iook for a job. I haven't tried there yet.

436
00:40:43,407 --> 00:40:45,807
Want someone to show you around?

437
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:03,692
- Give us a call next week.
- All right, thanks.

438
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:06,490
Well?

439
00:41:07,498 --> 00:41:10,433
<i>Maybe, but only part-time.

440
00:41:10,935 --> 00:41:14,063
It's not like you have rent.
You don't have to work full-time.

441
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:17,835
I need to get away
from Bobby full-time. Overtime.

442
00:41:18,442 --> 00:41:22,173
<i>Maybe I could help you get started

You can get your GE<i>D,</i> you know.

444
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:27,242
Sure I can. Then maybe I can go to Harvard.

445
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,278
<i>Maybe.

446
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:44,601
You know, you eat like shit?

447
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:46,669
You drink too much.

448
00:41:47,738 --> 00:41:48,727
Okay.

449
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:51,366
Would you let me read your book sometime?

450
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:53,535
- I don't think so.
- Why not?

451
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:57,636
<i>- M</i>ost of it ends up in the trash.
- How long you been writing it?

452
00:41:58,082 --> 00:42:00,209
Too long, and not long enough.

453
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:04,152
- Did you graduate from college?
- Yes, ma'am, I did.

454
00:42:04,221 --> 00:42:07,884
With the privilege of becoming
Bobby Long's teaching assistant.

455
00:42:09,126 --> 00:42:11,560
Why did y'all leave that school?

456
00:42:13,063 --> 00:42:16,328
It's complicated. So many reasons.

457
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,362
Tell me one.

458
00:42:22,306 --> 00:42:24,433
A lot happened real fast...

459
00:42:25,576 --> 00:42:27,373
and New Orleans, all this...

460
00:42:27,978 --> 00:42:30,344
it sort of seemed romantic at the time.

461
00:42:31,782 --> 00:42:32,976
Is it?

462
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:35,776
Is it romantic?

463
00:42:40,524 --> 00:42:42,287
It has its moments.

464
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:50,160
Would you really help me get my GED?

465
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:52,558
Yes, I really would.

466
00:42:53,837 --> 00:42:55,532
- Why?
- Why not?

467
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:57,897
Don't have anything else to do.

468
00:42:58,442 --> 00:43:00,740
Would you quit drinking so much?

469
00:43:02,112 --> 00:43:03,101
Why?

470
00:43:04,448 --> 00:43:07,315
Why not?
You don't have anything else to do.

471
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:13,618
All right.

472
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:16,790
All right.

473
00:43:37,915 --> 00:43:40,383
So, where is he, the son of a bitch?

474
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:45,587
Probably on some barstool somewhere,
whining about how misunderstood he is.

475
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:49,520
You've better things to do than waste
another day worrying about Bobby Long.

476
00:43:49,593 --> 00:43:52,653
He didn't. We had a nice day, didn't we?

477
00:43:54,832 --> 00:43:55,821
Yeah.

478
00:44:01,505 --> 00:44:03,996
Come on, darling, we better get home.

479
00:44:05,042 --> 00:44:06,600
See you at home.

480
00:44:12,883 --> 00:44:15,909
It must be getting pretty crowded for you,
only two rooms.

481
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:19,114
What about your work, sugar?
There's no privacy there.

482
00:44:19,189 --> 00:44:21,282
You could stay at my place.

483
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:25,160
Will you think about it?

484
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:35,934
I'm back.

485
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:40,333
Aren't you people glad to see me?

486
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:42,402
- No.
- You might have called.

487
00:44:43,213 --> 00:44:45,807
Well, then ask me. Say:

488
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:48,584
"Bobby, what have you brought me?"

489
00:44:52,723 --> 00:44:53,883
Biloxi?

490
00:44:55,793 --> 00:44:57,920
Video poker or nickel slots?

491
00:44:59,063 --> 00:45:01,361
<i>- Man, where's my car?
- I sold it.

492
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:04,731
Now, Pursey, go put some music on.
We're gonna celebrate.

493
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:10,140
- You what?
- I sold it. We didn't need a car.

494
00:45:10,607 --> 00:45:14,202
This is a single malt. When was the last time
you had a single malt?

495
00:45:14,278 --> 00:45:16,303
- For how much?
- $300.

496
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,543
You fucking sold my car for fucking $300?

497
00:45:19,616 --> 00:45:21,447
Have you lost
your goddamn mind completely?

498
00:45:21,518 --> 00:45:23,042
Just hold that punch.

499
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,878
Now, you remember...

500
00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:27,420
I have a broken face.

501
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:31,293
Now, I didn't have any money.

502
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:35,398
That's because your check is here.

503
00:45:35,499 --> 00:45:39,162
And this, too. From the lawyer.
It's time to tell her.

504
00:45:39,703 --> 00:45:42,900
I waited for you to get the...
What the fuck are you doing?

505
00:45:42,973 --> 00:45:46,932
You give me five minutes,
and then you do what you think is right.

506
00:45:50,881 --> 00:45:53,748
Well, look how nice
you changed everything.

507
00:45:55,552 --> 00:46:00,285
I'd have destroyed that TV weeks ago
if I'd known it would drive you to Steinbeck.

508
00:46:00,624 --> 00:46:03,184
All right, now, I have something to tell y'all.

509
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:04,921
Come on in, sit down.

510
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:08,154
Come on, man, sit...

511
00:46:08,665 --> 00:46:12,192
Will you stop grieving
about that hunk of shit and sit down?

512
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:13,531
I'll stand.

513
00:46:14,404 --> 00:46:16,201
All right<i>, c</i>lose your eyes.

514
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:20,904
- Close your eyes, man.
- I'm not closing my goddamn eyes.

515
00:46:20,978 --> 00:46:22,775
Come on, Lawson. Christ.

516
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:27,345
All right, now.

517
00:46:29,653 --> 00:46:31,644
You can open them now, darling.

518
00:46:32,556 --> 00:46:34,683
Courtesy of a lovely teacher...

519
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:38,694
whose heart once found Bobby Long
cause enough to skip a beat or two.

520
00:46:38,762 --> 00:46:42,289
"To certify that Purslane Hominy Will...

521
00:46:42,432 --> 00:46:45,299
"has su<i>cc</i>essfully completed
the 11th grade...

522
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:48,133
"and is recommended to the 12th grade."

523
00:46:48,772 --> 00:46:51,400
"Why stay we on earth except to grow?"

524
00:46:59,082 --> 00:47:00,447
Robert Browning.

525
00:47:00,517 --> 00:47:03,543
He's definitely your run-of-the-mill
senior-year poet.

526
00:47:04,521 --> 00:47:06,648
Is this really your idea of an apology...

527
00:47:06,723 --> 00:47:09,658
or are you just trying to one-up
his GED offer?

528
00:47:11,295 --> 00:47:12,694
Great minds.

529
00:47:18,569 --> 00:47:20,696
Come on, man.
Of course she takes a language.

530
00:47:20,771 --> 00:47:23,262
- You want to speak French, don't you?
- Don't be an ass.

531
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:26,309
You know that
she can't take French 1 as a senior.

532
00:47:26,443 --> 00:47:27,569
All right.

533
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:32,380
So we got English Lit, European History,
Geography, Psychology.

534
00:47:32,449 --> 00:47:34,041
We need one more.

535
00:47:34,585 --> 00:47:37,019
- I think Art Appreciation.
<i>- M</i>usic.

536
00:47:37,087 --> 00:47:39,555
- I think she'd like music.
- I'm not going.

537
00:47:43,327 --> 00:47:45,761
Well, God damn, it's already set up.

538
00:47:45,829 --> 00:47:48,992
Do you know how much I had to go through
for you for this?

539
00:47:49,066 --> 00:47:52,627
For me? You expect me to...
Come on. What's in it for you?

540
00:47:53,737 --> 00:47:56,797
Firstly, it'll get you out of the house,
for my sanity.

541
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:59,570
- That's what I thought.
- No, look.

542
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:02,607
You said something to me recently.
It got me thinking.

543
00:48:02,679 --> 00:48:04,806
You said, "I'm just a girl."

544
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:09,610
<i>Maybe I've grown too calloused
over the years, but you are just a girl.

545
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:14,347
Not unlike the students
that flowed through my classes years ago.

546
00:48:15,993 --> 00:48:18,621
And I know that
we must seem horrible to you...

547
00:48:18,695 --> 00:48:22,153
but we still got something to offer. We must.

548
00:48:24,801 --> 00:48:28,066
And besides,
I think we owe it to your mother.

549
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:32,200
And as hard is it is to believe...

550
00:48:32,643 --> 00:48:36,079
we, too, once were innocent children.

551
00:48:36,213 --> 00:48:38,113
You are such a shameless ham.

552
00:48:39,016 --> 00:48:41,280
What makes you think I could do this?

553
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:44,783
Because we know God, and God knows us.

554
00:48:45,355 --> 00:48:48,188
And he and Lorraine brought you here
for a reason.

555
00:48:49,393 --> 00:48:51,020
School starts in a month.

556
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:53,494
You can give us a chance. It might be fun.

557
00:48:53,563 --> 00:48:55,394
"Fun" is a stretch, don't you think?

558
00:48:55,465 --> 00:48:58,832
Listen, sweetheart,
that's one of your mama's songs.

559
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:02,031
That's beautiful.

560
00:49:06,143 --> 00:49:07,838
She'd be so proud.

561
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:00,588
What do you think of my face?

562
00:50:02,866 --> 00:50:05,357
See this bone? It's broken.

563
00:50:05,602 --> 00:50:07,229
But you can move it.

564
00:50:10,474 --> 00:50:12,169
How'd that happen?

565
00:50:13,076 --> 00:50:16,170
"Never fight fair with a stranger."
Arthur Miller.

566
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:18,837
That happened in a fight? You lost?

567
00:50:20,317 --> 00:50:22,683
Well, I lost a lot more than the fight.

568
00:50:24,988 --> 00:50:28,287
Does it take away from my appearance,
in your opinion, miss?

569
00:50:29,326 --> 00:50:31,453
I think you're still handsome.

570
00:50:31,728 --> 00:50:34,424
Well, aren't y'all sweet?

571
00:50:36,466 --> 00:50:39,367
Are you having sexual intercourse
with one another?

572
00:50:41,638 --> 00:50:44,869
- Okay<i>, D</i>r. Ruth, let's go.
- It's all right if you are.

573
00:50:45,142 --> 00:50:46,541
Sex is nice.

574
00:50:47,144 --> 00:50:49,544
Just remember to be kind to one another.

575
00:50:49,646 --> 00:50:53,605
And stay young as long as you can.
Your youth is fleeting. Be kind.

576
00:50:54,985 --> 00:50:56,782
We should start with memorization.

577
00:50:56,853 --> 00:50:59,253
I think we should stick to
the Socratic method.

578
00:50:59,322 --> 00:51:02,814
You do? Just exactly who is Plato
and who is Socrates...

579
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:05,088
in this arrangement?
Because I'll just stay out.

580
00:51:05,162 --> 00:51:07,130
You are Socrates, of course.

581
00:51:07,197 --> 00:51:09,688
- You are the Teacher.
- You're goddamn right I am.

582
00:51:09,766 --> 00:51:11,393
I wish y'all would just shut up...

583
00:51:11,468 --> 00:51:14,460
because if it's gonna be like this,
I ain't learning nothing.

584
00:51:14,538 --> 00:51:17,268
Girl, your English is fucking atrocious.

585
00:51:18,475 --> 00:51:20,375
Purslane Hominy, sit up.

586
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:22,439
Why can't I study in bed?

587
00:51:22,546 --> 00:51:24,878
It's so hot,
and this chair is so uncomfortable.

588
00:51:24,948 --> 00:51:28,543
It is not supposed to be comfortable.
It'll put your brain to sleep. Sit up.

589
00:51:28,618 --> 00:51:31,746
- It's just bad habits.
- You're talking to me about bad habits?

590
00:51:31,822 --> 00:51:34,484
Don't fuck with the Teacher, okay?

591
00:51:35,058 --> 00:51:39,051
Just tell me what is Nebraska's role
in American Literature? Go.

592
00:51:39,129 --> 00:51:43,327
- Shouldn't I be learning the state capitals?
<i>- B</i>ullshit. You'll learn what matters.

593
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:46,028
- Don't procrastinate.
<i>- B</i>y whatever do you mean?

594
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:48,765
I don't have a card for procrastinate.

595
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:51,137
You are just incorrigible.

596
00:51:58,048 --> 00:51:59,310
"Procrastinate.

597
00:51:59,549 --> 00:52:02,040
"To drag one's ass
in such a pathetic manner...

598
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:05,054
"as to ensure one's place in life as a loser."

599
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:07,420
Hey, who are you calling a loser?

600
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:10,089
- Fuck.
- Go.

601
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:12,594
All right, Nebraska.

602
00:52:12,696 --> 00:52:16,257
Home state of Willa Cather,
one of our first su<i>cc</i>essful female authors.

603
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:19,029
Or should I move east to Missouri,
where <i>Mark Twain...

604
00:52:19,102 --> 00:52:21,764
alias Samuel Clemens, was born,
or down south to Kansas...

605
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:23,965
where William Burroughs
spent his last years?

606
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,474
- Stop!
- Hey, man...

607
00:52:26,543 --> 00:52:29,273
I don't think they'll teach Burroughs
at Catholic school.

608
00:52:29,346 --> 00:52:30,836
Well, they ought to.

609
00:52:45,395 --> 00:52:47,886
Why don't you pour your old buddy a drink?

610
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:51,331
- We're out of juice.
- Well, what's in that glass?

611
00:52:52,402 --> 00:52:54,063
It doesn't have a smell.

612
00:52:54,137 --> 00:52:57,197
Well, God damn it,
pour some vodka in it then.

613
00:52:59,309 --> 00:53:01,539
- Go ahead.
- We gotta quit.

614
00:53:01,811 --> 00:53:05,941
I promised Pursey if she'd study.
I mean, look at us. We're worthless.

615
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:09,744
And when was that, that you quit?

616
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:13,554
Nineteen hours ago, when we were quizzing.

617
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:19,896
- Did you get some sleep?
- No.

618
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:26,767
There's no rush for her or for us...

619
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:30,837
so if you want to quit, take it slow.

620
00:53:31,675 --> 00:53:33,233
Now, trust me on this.

621
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:36,170
Take away the bottle, take away the genie.

622
00:54:33,303 --> 00:54:35,203
Hey, what are you doing here?

623
00:54:38,008 --> 00:54:40,738
I just thought I'd give Lawson a break.

624
00:54:41,011 --> 00:54:43,502
Let him use the bedroom.
Come on, sit down.

625
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:53,320
You look very pretty today, Purslane.

626
00:54:53,723 --> 00:54:56,886
No one calls me that
but my dead grandmother, but thanks.

627
00:54:57,193 --> 00:54:59,354
Now, you remember how to get there?

628
00:54:59,863 --> 00:55:03,424
I know where it is all right,
so I guess I should be going.

629
00:55:05,068 --> 00:55:06,262
You nervous?

630
00:55:07,237 --> 00:55:08,226
No.

631
00:55:10,874 --> 00:55:11,966
Yeah.

632
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:16,076
Want me to take the streetcar with you?

633
00:55:16,746 --> 00:55:18,373
No, I'll be okay.

634
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:23,718
Well, I know you'll just do fine.

635
00:55:24,187 --> 00:55:26,951
And we'll be right here
when you get back from school...

636
00:55:27,023 --> 00:55:28,820
to help you with your homework.

637
00:55:28,892 --> 00:55:31,520
Christ, you're really living
in some parallel universe.

638
00:55:31,594 --> 00:55:33,858
Me and "homework" in the same sentence.

639
00:55:41,871 --> 00:55:45,773
It's about to become you and "tardy"
in the same sentence, so...

640
00:56:01,925 --> 00:56:03,517
Think she'll come right home?

641
00:56:03,593 --> 00:56:06,255
Where else would a teenage girl go
but straight home...

642
00:56:06,329 --> 00:56:08,695
to her endlessly entertaining
middle-aged roommates?

643
00:56:08,765 --> 00:56:12,326
She's no picnic.
Tortures me with that noise.

644
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:17,165
That child should know
anything worth listening to is on vinyl.

645
00:56:17,941 --> 00:56:19,272
My kids knew it.

646
00:56:20,443 --> 00:56:23,276
I taught them. I was their father.

647
00:56:25,248 --> 00:56:26,476
You still are.

648
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:35,354
One day they'll understand,
when you finish that book.

649
00:56:39,362 --> 00:56:41,193
My kids don't even know me.

650
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:44,629
Shit<i>, c</i>an we do anything besides this?

651
00:56:44,701 --> 00:56:46,635
- Like what?
- Fuck if I know.

652
00:56:46,703 --> 00:56:49,695
- We could go fishing.
- You don't fish.

653
00:56:51,307 --> 00:56:52,934
<i>Maybe I should start...

654
00:56:54,844 --> 00:56:56,175
something.

655
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:59,044
<i>Maybe you should start working
on your damn book.

656
00:57:01,184 --> 00:57:03,550
I don't know the end of the story yet.

657
00:57:04,287 --> 00:57:07,313
Checkmate. Let's get out of here.
We're depressing me.

658
00:57:11,561 --> 00:57:13,529
You know, I wanna say something...

659
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:17,293
about life, because an unexamined life...

660
00:57:17,367 --> 00:57:20,461
- is simply a life...
- Not worth living.

661
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:23,629
Purslane, our prodigy has returned.

662
00:57:23,706 --> 00:57:25,731
Now, tell us everything.

663
00:57:27,877 --> 00:57:30,675
Honey, why did you leave school early?

664
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:35,611
I didn't belong there.

665
00:57:35,685 --> 00:57:39,621
I appreciate what y'all are doing,
but I'm not going back.

666
00:57:39,989 --> 00:57:41,115
What?

667
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:43,421
I really need a job.

668
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:49,621
- You can work here on the weekends, sugar.
- Really?

669
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:54,366
- Only if you're in school, though.
- Good one, Earl.

670
00:58:09,385 --> 00:58:12,286
<i>Autumn comes slowly in New Orleans.</i>

671
00:58:13,289 --> 00:58:15,484
<i>The grass remains a stubborn green...</i>

672
00:58:15,558 --> 00:58:18,118
<i>but the heat gives way to a gentle warmth.</i>

673
00:58:19,062 --> 00:58:21,758
<i>Pursey did begin to catch on in school.</i>

674
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:25,495
<i>She was surprised. We weren't.</i>

675
00:58:28,071 --> 00:58:31,905
<i>Winter arrived before we realized</i>
<i>the sunlit hours of summer had waned.</i>

676
00:58:37,981 --> 00:58:40,506
<i>Somehow, the wine began</i>
<i>to outlast the day...</i>

677
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:47,221
<i>and that was more than</i>
<i>anyone could have asked for.</i>

678
00:58:57,033 --> 00:59:01,060
Someone should have told them Creoles we
got something called winter in Louisiana.

679
00:59:01,137 --> 00:59:03,332
We might have improved
on their oversight...

680
00:59:03,406 --> 00:59:05,874
with this cool new invention called heat.

681
00:59:06,109 --> 00:59:09,101
- Pursey, where'd you put the vodka?
- You told me to hide it.

682
00:59:09,178 --> 00:59:11,669
I did. But where did you hide it?

683
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:13,940
I'm not supposed to tell you, remember?

684
00:59:14,017 --> 00:59:16,577
You don't do anything else I tell you to do.
Where is it?

685
00:59:16,653 --> 00:59:20,555
Lawson<i>, B</i>obby's trying to get me
to tell him where the vodka is again.

686
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:25,490
- It is Christmas.
- Whatever. It's under the back stairs.

687
00:59:26,696 --> 00:59:29,927
And I could have sworn
it was your turn to do the laundry.

688
00:59:29,999 --> 00:59:32,490
Don't forget to use the cuddly bear stuff.

689
01:00:01,364 --> 01:00:03,457
But you aren't a virgin, are you?

690
01:00:04,367 --> 01:00:07,165
You know, some people would call you
a disgusting old man...

691
01:00:07,236 --> 01:00:08,931
for your constant sexual harassment.

692
01:00:09,005 --> 01:00:12,463
I believe the term is "dirty old man,"
not "disgusting."

693
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:15,911
And you are a young, blooming bud.

694
01:00:16,179 --> 01:00:19,876
- Let me live vicariously. You aren't, are you?
- Are you?

695
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:22,042
Well, I have children.

696
01:00:22,919 --> 01:00:24,750
Why don't you ever see them?

697
01:00:25,021 --> 01:00:28,787
Well, that's a good question.
But you haven't answered mine.

698
01:00:29,092 --> 01:00:32,220
You know, I'm trying to be serious for once,
Bobby. God.

699
01:00:36,866 --> 01:00:40,358
The truth is, I wish I could see them.
I miss them like hell.

700
01:00:43,773 --> 01:00:46,708
It seems to me
if someone wanted to see their kids...

701
01:00:46,776 --> 01:00:50,177
then they damn well would,
unless they didn't give a shit.

702
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:54,840
How about you?

703
01:00:55,184 --> 01:00:58,984
Do you remember your mother
when y'all were living together?

704
01:01:03,026 --> 01:01:06,223
No, not really.

705
01:01:10,099 --> 01:01:13,227
I used to try to remember her.

706
01:01:16,606 --> 01:01:18,369
Anything about her.

707
01:01:19,942 --> 01:01:24,106
Like her voice, the way she smelled,
you know, anything.

708
01:01:25,815 --> 01:01:29,182
I used to think real hard...

709
01:01:29,252 --> 01:01:31,584
wanting memories.

710
01:01:32,422 --> 01:01:35,152
And I just started making them up.

711
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:42,854
That she was putting on her eye shadow
and talking to me in the mirror...

712
01:01:42,932 --> 01:01:43,921
or I'd pretend that...

713
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,959
she'd make me these perfect grilled cheeses
with the crusts cut off.

714
01:01:48,471 --> 01:01:51,770
I had all kinds of made-up memories.

715
01:01:52,408 --> 01:01:56,572
My favorite one was that
she'd take me to see her shows...

716
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:00,610
and I would be sitting on the side
with this nice man...

717
01:02:00,683 --> 01:02:03,743
who'd give me
all the Shirley Temples I wanted.

718
01:02:06,923 --> 01:02:09,187
I made up so many memories...

719
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:15,758
I actually started to believe
I was really remembering her.

720
01:02:19,335 --> 01:02:22,270
But she never came for me, so I just forgot.

721
01:02:23,106 --> 01:02:24,368
You know...

722
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:27,804
stopped pretending.

723
01:02:32,381 --> 01:02:34,246
Ho, ho, ho!

724
01:02:35,518 --> 01:02:38,919
- Is that a real tree?
- Lord, where did you get that?

725
01:02:39,555 --> 01:02:41,523
It fell off the back of a truck.

726
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:44,617
- Like hell it did.
- All right, maybe it was a Volvo.

727
01:02:44,694 --> 01:02:47,424
We should put it right up front
where everybody could see.

728
01:02:47,497 --> 01:02:48,589
Sure.

729
01:02:49,699 --> 01:02:51,826
Lawson, where's the laundry?

730
01:02:52,635 --> 01:02:53,727
Shit.

731
01:02:58,574 --> 01:03:02,510
"I remember the day I graduated
from protégé to confidant.

732
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:09,179
"He never meant to let me in on his secrets.

733
01:03:09,252 --> 01:03:11,516
"He thrived on his own mystery.

734
01:03:11,854 --> 01:03:14,084
"But once the first one was discovered...

735
01:03:14,157 --> 01:03:17,593
"it wasn't long before
there were none left between us.

736
01:03:18,661 --> 01:03:20,720
"I was on the back steps of the library...

737
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:24,324
"when I spotted his uniform,
a freshly laundered shirt...

738
01:03:24,734 --> 01:03:27,464
"the color of Easter, and that damn hat.

739
01:03:28,404 --> 01:03:31,032
"He strode across campus with purpose.

740
01:03:31,107 --> 01:03:33,541
"Everything about Tommy said ready."

741
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:37,170
- I'm Tommy<i>, j</i>ust so you can follow.
- Sounds just like you.

742
01:03:40,516 --> 01:03:42,643
"He almost skipped right passed me.

743
01:03:42,718 --> 01:03:45,812
"'Nice hat,' I said...

744
01:03:45,888 --> 01:03:48,618
"eliciting Tommy's notorious smile.

745
01:03:49,225 --> 01:03:53,525
"It was the same smile that he granted
to each woman that caught his eye.

746
01:03:53,596 --> 01:03:57,657
"The smile that served as an answer
to all undesirable questions.

747
01:03:57,733 --> 01:03:59,667
"Or the smile for one of his children...

748
01:03:59,735 --> 01:04:03,000
"whenever he found
a tiny hand reaching for his."

749
01:04:03,806 --> 01:04:05,205
That's nice...

750
01:04:05,908 --> 01:04:09,071
- but I think that might be a bad sentence.
- I think they all are.

751
01:04:09,145 --> 01:04:12,410
That's why they're hanging
from the goddamn Christmas tree.

752
01:04:12,481 --> 01:04:16,110
No, but it's just that, normally,
it's just not on...

753
01:04:17,486 --> 01:04:21,479
"Tommy took the stairs, two at a time,
bellowing, 'Well, God damn...

754
01:04:21,757 --> 01:04:24,851
"if it isn't the South's next great native son.'

755
01:04:25,161 --> 01:04:29,120
"I was only one of hundreds
who came religiously twice a week...

756
01:04:29,265 --> 01:04:33,497
"to be dazzled by the Professor,
each performance worthy of applause.

757
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:37,697
"Tommy, at the front of the hall,
waving his arms wildly...

758
01:04:37,773 --> 01:04:40,298
"as if mastering an imaginary lasso."

759
01:04:42,578 --> 01:04:46,173
- I like "lariat" better. I think you...
- I like "lasso."

760
01:04:49,986 --> 01:04:52,420
Years ago, you trusted my opinion.

761
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:55,080
Years ago, you were easier to trust.

762
01:05:48,077 --> 01:05:51,103
Thank y'all very much.
Have a Merry Christmas.

763
01:05:52,014 --> 01:05:55,415
Nobody can do the Alabama shuffle
as good as Bobby Long...

764
01:05:55,518 --> 01:05:58,009
but this sweet thing, she can move.

765
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:05,958
- Why can't you be this sweet all the time?
- Sure, and what would that get me?

766
01:06:06,896 --> 01:06:09,194
Pure, unadulterated joy.

767
01:06:09,298 --> 01:06:13,234
- You keep your lecherous eyes off our girl.
- What?

768
01:06:13,836 --> 01:06:17,670
She don't like me.
She likes Lawson better than she likes me.

769
01:06:19,408 --> 01:06:22,104
You like Lawson better than me, don't you?

770
01:06:23,879 --> 01:06:25,312
You're drunk.

771
01:06:25,381 --> 01:06:28,214
You know what, I am. I really am.

772
01:06:28,284 --> 01:06:31,651
But it's all right,
because Lawson is gonna take us home.

773
01:06:31,721 --> 01:06:34,315
Not tonight. I got him all to myself.

774
01:06:35,324 --> 01:06:37,884
You told them about the news, honey?

775
01:06:38,427 --> 01:06:41,021
We were just thinking
that maybe after the holidays...

776
01:06:41,097 --> 01:06:43,531
he could move in with me
and get some more work done.

777
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:46,432
It's just something that we kicked around.

778
01:06:58,981 --> 01:07:01,541
Lawson is not in love with you.

779
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:07,380
Bobby, I don't think
that's any of your damn business.

780
01:07:08,224 --> 01:07:12,092
I've seen him with a woman
that he can't get enough of.

781
01:07:12,762 --> 01:07:16,289
A woman that's crawled
into every molecule of his being...

782
01:07:16,499 --> 01:07:18,967
that consumed his every thought...

783
01:07:19,335 --> 01:07:22,896
and turned him into a creation
of devotion and obsession.

784
01:07:22,972 --> 01:07:25,463
I have the scars of that love on my face.

785
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:27,968
Have you told her about that?

786
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:31,480
Have you told her
about the difference between true love...

787
01:07:31,547 --> 01:07:33,742
and a warm bed to pass the time away?

788
01:07:33,816 --> 01:07:37,013
Cool it. Don't go after her.
I never said I was going anywhere.

789
01:07:37,086 --> 01:07:38,986
I only speak the truth.

790
01:07:40,289 --> 01:07:42,883
The woman deserves to know the truth.

791
01:07:45,761 --> 01:07:48,730
And you, you're free to do as you please.

792
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:54,392
Am I, really?

793
01:07:55,137 --> 01:07:56,798
Finally free?

794
01:08:00,810 --> 01:08:03,176
I want to say something on this o<i>cc</i>asion...

795
01:08:03,245 --> 01:08:07,306
where we're celebrating our love
and friendships with one another.

796
01:08:08,551 --> 01:08:11,679
"Friend by enemy I call you out

797
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:15,315
"You there, with a bad coin in your socket

798
01:08:15,391 --> 01:08:18,326
"You there, my friend with a winning air

799
01:08:19,395 --> 01:08:23,729
"Who palmed the lie on me when you looked
Brassily at my shyest secret

800
01:08:24,366 --> 01:08:27,130
"With my whole heart under your hammer

801
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:30,368
"That though I loved him for his faults

802
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:32,532
"As much as for his good

803
01:08:33,843 --> 01:08:36,710
"My friend were an enemy on stilts

804
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:39,179
"With his head in a cunning cloud"

805
01:08:45,454 --> 01:08:46,819
Bravo, man.

806
01:08:49,325 --> 01:08:53,659
Now, why don't you come out
and fucking say what you really mean?

807
01:08:54,997 --> 01:08:58,626
Does every word out of your mouth
have to be in character...

808
01:08:59,235 --> 01:09:02,932
or is that the idea:
<i>J</i>ust to be anybody but who you really are?

809
01:09:04,306 --> 01:09:07,867
You want to tell me
that you're disappointed in me?

810
01:09:08,577 --> 01:09:11,205
'Cause maybe I'm disappointed in you.

811
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:15,242
You know, I never asked
to write your damn book.

812
01:09:16,252 --> 01:09:19,483
Your redemption and my penance, right?

813
01:09:21,624 --> 01:09:23,148
Haven't I paid?

814
01:09:24,527 --> 01:09:27,087
Nine fucking years.

815
01:09:32,234 --> 01:09:34,828
I am sorry, all right?

816
01:09:35,304 --> 01:09:37,602
I am so fucking sorry.

817
01:09:41,677 --> 01:09:43,338
It's Dylan Thomas.

818
01:09:46,348 --> 01:09:48,509
<i>To Others Than You.</i>

819
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:55,786
That's an easy one.

820
01:10:08,304 --> 01:10:09,965
Good night<i>, B</i>obby.

821
01:10:58,687 --> 01:10:59,813
Shit.

822
01:11:16,839 --> 01:11:18,807
You okay? Can I come in?

823
01:11:30,486 --> 01:11:33,353
You really did a number on yourself
this time.

824
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:37,154
Lawson's gonna leave me right by myself.

825
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:40,021
I always knew it.

826
01:11:42,231 --> 01:11:43,698
I deserve it.

827
01:11:45,801 --> 01:11:47,598
I'm gonna die alone.

828
01:11:56,745 --> 01:11:58,303
He's not gonna leave you.

829
01:11:58,380 --> 01:11:59,972
- Yes, he is.
- No.

830
01:12:00,449 --> 01:12:02,144
He'll always be there for you.

831
01:12:02,217 --> 01:12:05,584
He cut up my story
and hung it on the Christmas tree.

832
01:12:18,734 --> 01:12:21,294
Honey, I peed myself.

833
01:12:22,204 --> 01:12:25,071
All right, let's get you into bed. Come on.

834
01:12:26,141 --> 01:12:27,631
Oh, God.

835
01:12:49,932 --> 01:12:51,832
It's so damn cold.

836
01:13:17,726 --> 01:13:19,057
How is he?

837
01:13:21,263 --> 01:13:23,823
- I think he peed blood.
- God damn it.

838
01:13:24,833 --> 01:13:27,233
I knew he wasn't himself tonight.

839
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:30,370
He's afraid of doctors.

840
01:13:30,973 --> 01:13:34,136
It's probably some bacterial thing.
It's nothing.

841
01:13:41,583 --> 01:13:44,711
- Are you gonna move out?
- No.

842
01:13:53,829 --> 01:13:55,820
Are you in love with her?

843
01:13:57,266 --> 01:13:58,324
No.

844
01:14:01,870 --> 01:14:03,531
She's really nice.

845
01:14:05,941 --> 01:14:07,499
Yeah, she is.

846
01:14:09,945 --> 01:14:11,970
Are you worried about him?

847
01:14:21,890 --> 01:14:23,755
What happened, Lawson?

848
01:14:33,802 --> 01:14:37,602
When I met Bobby,
he seemed absolutely larger than life.

849
01:14:39,842 --> 01:14:42,310
Did whatever the hell he wanted...

850
01:14:42,678 --> 01:14:45,670
but still he had the beautiful wife and kids.

851
01:14:46,381 --> 01:14:49,009
Students loved him. Faculty hated him.

852
01:14:50,118 --> 01:14:51,380
Women wanted him.

853
01:14:51,453 --> 01:14:54,616
Christ, he had me so convinced
of my own grand destiny...

854
01:14:54,690 --> 01:14:58,285
I may have fallen a little in love myself.

855
01:15:03,732 --> 01:15:05,757
We hung out all the time.

856
01:15:09,037 --> 01:15:13,098
There was a woman who I wanted to marry.

857
01:15:14,109 --> 01:15:16,771
Her friend fell for Bobby pretty hard.

858
01:15:18,247 --> 01:15:22,274
He started spending more time with us
than he was at home.

859
01:15:25,687 --> 01:15:28,952
One night,
their youngest had a Little League game.

860
01:15:31,627 --> 01:15:33,561
It was a double-header.

861
01:15:34,162 --> 01:15:38,064
So I convinced him to have drinks
with the girls first.

862
01:15:38,867 --> 01:15:41,563
Said I'd go to the game with him later.

863
01:15:42,738 --> 01:15:45,206
He kept on saying he had to leave.

864
01:15:45,941 --> 01:15:49,934
Somehow one drink became two,
and then three.

865
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:53,575
And then...

866
01:15:54,816 --> 01:15:57,717
this idiot, the dean's nephew...

867
01:15:58,020 --> 01:16:00,011
came in and announced...

868
01:16:02,291 --> 01:16:05,158
that he was sleeping with my girlfriend...

869
01:16:05,527 --> 01:16:07,495
and everyone knew but me.

870
01:16:09,097 --> 01:16:11,292
I went after him.

871
01:16:12,234 --> 01:16:13,599
He took a swing.

872
01:16:14,503 --> 01:16:16,061
Bobby stepped in...

873
01:16:16,138 --> 01:16:18,868
and he cracked Bobby's face wide open.

874
01:16:21,209 --> 01:16:25,168
Bobby went crazy.
He beat up that kid pretty bad.

875
01:16:30,185 --> 01:16:31,914
It'd just gotten so late.

876
01:16:33,755 --> 01:16:35,689
I knew Ben would be waiting.

877
01:16:38,727 --> 01:16:41,821
But when we got there, he was gone.

878
01:16:46,168 --> 01:16:47,465
Everyone was.

879
01:16:50,505 --> 01:16:52,769
He should never have been by himself.

880
01:16:55,877 --> 01:16:59,472
He was just a little boy, and it was so dark.

881
01:17:06,922 --> 01:17:08,981
There's too many people...

882
01:17:09,424 --> 01:17:11,517
in such a damn hurry on that road.

883
01:17:11,593 --> 01:17:14,118
There's no way
a driver could have seen him.

884
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:17,621
I mean, he was so little.

885
01:17:19,601 --> 01:17:21,933
And, God, he worshipped his dad.

886
01:17:27,342 --> 01:17:30,311
Juliette told Bobby to leave
and never come back.

887
01:17:31,213 --> 01:17:33,147
She needed a better man.

888
01:17:34,282 --> 01:17:36,113
That's how she put it.

889
01:17:40,522 --> 01:17:41,955
So you came here?

890
01:17:44,393 --> 01:17:48,420
Seemed like a good place to write.
It was far away...

891
01:17:51,566 --> 01:17:53,124
good universities.

892
01:17:54,036 --> 01:17:55,970
Bobby could start over.

893
01:17:57,606 --> 01:17:59,870
I thought I should be here with him.

894
01:18:01,276 --> 01:18:04,109
I mean, if it wasn't for me that night...

895
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:07,277
things might have...

896
01:18:12,421 --> 01:18:14,821
I don't know what happened, really.

897
01:18:16,291 --> 01:18:18,225
We read too many damn books.

898
01:18:21,263 --> 01:18:23,390
There's something about this city.

899
01:18:26,201 --> 01:18:27,293
That's all.

900
01:18:33,742 --> 01:18:35,676
You should get some sleep.

901
01:19:48,750 --> 01:19:51,048
I made you breakfast in mattress.

902
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:53,147
Thank you, ma'am.

903
01:19:55,824 --> 01:19:57,917
Have we heard from the man yet?

904
01:19:58,760 --> 01:20:00,921
No. Should we get him up first?

905
01:20:02,097 --> 01:20:04,531
Can you give me that shirt, please?

906
01:20:07,435 --> 01:20:08,561
Thank you.

907
01:20:33,762 --> 01:20:34,956
Nice hat.

908
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:41,534
Get up, old man.
I hear we gotta take you to a doctor.

909
01:20:41,603 --> 01:20:43,730
And get that off your pecker.

910
01:20:44,005 --> 01:20:46,974
What do you care?
You're slicing it up, anyway.

911
01:20:47,142 --> 01:20:50,202
It doesn't mean I want my book
getting the clap.

912
01:20:53,114 --> 01:20:56,550
I had the urge to read something likable
about myself.

913
01:20:57,786 --> 01:20:59,276
Find anything?

914
01:21:00,488 --> 01:21:01,819
Not really.

915
01:21:06,728 --> 01:21:10,391
I didn't mean to mess things up
between you and Georgianna.

916
01:21:13,201 --> 01:21:15,260
I didn't mean what I said.

917
01:21:16,938 --> 01:21:18,303
Oh, Christ.

918
01:21:18,406 --> 01:21:21,603
Last night was a blur.
I don't know what was said.

919
01:21:22,210 --> 01:21:24,110
And I don't want to remember.

920
01:21:25,247 --> 01:21:28,512
- Come on.
- Good, presents. Yay!

921
01:21:29,451 --> 01:21:30,816
Merry Christmas!

922
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:38,485
<i>It was our home that night, all of ours.</i>

923
01:21:39,694 --> 01:21:42,128
<i>We both knew we should tell her the truth...</i>

924
01:21:42,197 --> 01:21:44,859
<i>but every day felt like the wrong day.</i>

925
01:21:45,834 --> 01:21:49,531
<i>And Christmas is as good a day as any</i>
<i>to believe in fairy tales.</i>

926
01:21:57,379 --> 01:22:00,678
<i>That night reminded Bobby and me</i>
<i>of a time in our lives...</i>

927
01:22:00,749 --> 01:22:03,684
<i>we'd both chosen to forget until she arrived.</i>

928
01:22:04,953 --> 01:22:06,750
<i>It felt good to remember...</i>

929
01:22:08,323 --> 01:22:10,120
<i>if just for a little while.</i>

930
01:22:20,001 --> 01:22:21,400
I'm so full.

931
01:22:23,538 --> 01:22:25,563
<i>- M</i>e, too.
<i>- M</i>e, too.

932
01:22:28,610 --> 01:22:30,134
I wish it would snow.

933
01:22:31,279 --> 01:22:33,372
<i>- M</i>e, too.
<i>- M</i>e, too.

934
01:22:36,484 --> 01:22:37,951
But I love the rain.

935
01:22:39,354 --> 01:22:41,788
<i>- M</i>e, too.
<i>- M</i>e, too.

936
01:22:49,097 --> 01:22:51,588
Come on, man. You gotta piss sometime.

937
01:22:52,534 --> 01:22:54,934
Christ, I can't do it
while you're watching me.

938
01:22:55,003 --> 01:22:56,868
I've seen you piss a thousand times.

939
01:22:56,938 --> 01:22:59,463
Well, suddenly I am shy, okay?

940
01:22:59,841 --> 01:23:01,706
Piss right now.

941
01:23:03,845 --> 01:23:06,370
Christ, it's probably nothing, man.

942
01:23:11,252 --> 01:23:13,379
I've lived long enough anyhow.

943
01:23:15,957 --> 01:23:17,549
Lord, it's cold.

944
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:22,827
It's clear. I pissed clear.

945
01:23:22,897 --> 01:23:25,058
Like hell you did. Don't lie to me.

946
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:27,666
So it was a little pink. I'm not going.

947
01:23:38,847 --> 01:23:43,307
You got any short stories
you haven't destroyed by fire or scissor?

948
01:23:43,518 --> 01:23:46,282
My English final, I gotta write something...

949
01:23:46,354 --> 01:23:49,812
and read it in front of the entire class,
and there's no exceptions.

950
01:23:49,891 --> 01:23:52,359
- Fuck!
- So you're doing okay in English.

951
01:23:53,161 --> 01:23:56,130
I'm doing okay reading English.
I'm not a writer.

952
01:23:57,766 --> 01:24:00,166
- What the hell are you wearing?
- What do you care?

953
01:24:00,235 --> 01:24:03,204
It's Lorraine's.
You just let her stuff collect dust in there.

954
01:24:03,271 --> 01:24:05,796
You'd rather freeze
than wear your mama's clothes.

955
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:07,899
This robe and the person who wore it...

956
01:24:07,976 --> 01:24:11,434
is worth more than a hundred people
who don't appreciate them.

957
01:24:12,447 --> 01:24:13,914
Is something wrong?

958
01:24:14,149 --> 01:24:16,481
- You gonna tell her?
- Tell her what?

959
01:24:16,851 --> 01:24:20,548
We gotta take Bobby to the doctor.
He's still pissing blood.

960
01:24:20,789 --> 01:24:22,950
He's been putting it off for weeks.

961
01:24:27,495 --> 01:24:28,484
Okay.

962
01:24:29,330 --> 01:24:31,594
I hope you're not wearing
them lady underwear.

963
01:24:31,666 --> 01:24:34,794
I most certainly am. They're good luck.

964
01:24:35,670 --> 01:24:37,968
Besides, they're gonna
take them off anyway...

965
01:24:38,039 --> 01:24:40,439
and put one of them
backless numbers on me.

966
01:24:40,508 --> 01:24:42,203
Everybody's seen my peter.

967
01:24:42,277 --> 01:24:45,940
That's right.
Everyone just wants to see your peter.

968
01:24:46,481 --> 01:24:47,914
And my ass.

969
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:49,978
Let's go.

970
01:24:55,857 --> 01:25:00,157
What did I tell you?
Goddamn string draped over my ass.

971
01:25:24,986 --> 01:25:28,717
Where's Bobby? I made him
that andouille gumbo shit he loves.

972
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:31,224
They needed him for some more tests.

973
01:25:31,793 --> 01:25:34,387
- Is he all right?
- They think so.

974
01:25:34,896 --> 01:25:37,797
They just gotta look at his toe
and make sure.

975
01:25:39,334 --> 01:25:43,293
Well, then, maybe you might wanna
invite Georgianna over for dinner.

976
01:25:43,371 --> 01:25:47,034
I think she's working.
Is there an o<i>cc</i>asion I don't know about?

977
01:25:48,309 --> 01:25:49,799
I have a date.

978
01:25:50,778 --> 01:25:52,746
Really? That's a first.

979
01:25:54,115 --> 01:25:56,913
I figured it was about time I got a life.

980
01:25:58,953 --> 01:26:00,318
Great to hear it.

981
01:26:00,522 --> 01:26:02,319
- Is that a new dress?
- Yeah.

982
01:26:03,091 --> 01:26:04,581
Well, sort of.

983
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:09,719
I mean<i>, B</i>obby's right. There's no reason
to let Lorraine's clothes collect dust.

984
01:26:09,797 --> 01:26:13,563
She was really tiny.
You should have seen me trying to zip it up.

985
01:26:13,635 --> 01:26:15,933
Just make sure it stays zipped up.

986
01:26:17,138 --> 01:26:20,767
I'm a big girl, Lawson.
I have been for quite some time now.

987
01:26:26,414 --> 01:26:29,577
Hey, is that an SAT application?

988
01:26:29,651 --> 01:26:33,087
Yeah. My guidance counselor gave it to me.
I meant to throw it out.

989
01:26:33,154 --> 01:26:34,143
What?

990
01:26:34,222 --> 01:26:38,124
If she thinks your grades are good enough
for college, you go to college.

991
01:26:38,193 --> 01:26:41,458
- Well<i>, c</i>ollege costs money.
- There's financial aid.

992
01:26:42,297 --> 01:26:44,162
I might have to go away.

993
01:26:45,733 --> 01:26:47,098
You might.

994
01:26:48,937 --> 01:26:51,770
- I have to go.
- Isn't he picking you up?

995
01:26:52,273 --> 01:26:54,207
No. I'm meeting him somewhere.

996
01:26:54,609 --> 01:26:56,975
You can't walk home
from the streetcar alone.

997
01:26:57,045 --> 01:26:59,980
- Call me at Ray and Ruthie's and I'll...
- No, I'll get a ride.

998
01:27:00,048 --> 01:27:02,516
Besides, you should spend time alone
with Georgianna.

999
01:27:02,584 --> 01:27:06,042
You haven't stayed over there
since before Christmas, right?

1000
01:27:20,535 --> 01:27:23,629
You said you wanted to see more
of the New Orleans music scene.

1001
01:27:23,705 --> 01:27:26,105
I figure this is a good place to start.

1002
01:27:36,117 --> 01:27:37,880
- I know him.
- Really?

1003
01:27:55,570 --> 01:27:57,595
Hey, sugar, what are you doing here?

1004
01:27:57,672 --> 01:28:00,402
My friend Sean brought me.
Sean, this is Junior.

1005
01:28:00,475 --> 01:28:02,739
Great to meet you.
I've seen you play around, man.

1006
01:28:02,810 --> 01:28:06,610
You are great, man. Really, really great.

1007
01:28:07,582 --> 01:28:10,016
How come I didn't know
you were a badass sax player?

1008
01:28:10,084 --> 01:28:12,780
Well, I don't play much anymore, you know.

1009
01:28:13,221 --> 01:28:15,519
I mean, I don't have...

1010
01:28:17,058 --> 01:28:19,049
Don't got the lungs for it.

1011
01:28:19,127 --> 01:28:21,595
- How's Bobby?
<i>- B</i>etter than you sound.

1012
01:28:22,330 --> 01:28:25,993
- You sitting in again, or what?
- Tiny, there's somebody I want you to meet.

1013
01:28:26,067 --> 01:28:28,934
This can't be that sweet baby girl, Purslane.

1014
01:28:30,305 --> 01:28:33,172
- You don't remember me, do you?
- No, sorry.

1015
01:28:33,941 --> 01:28:35,806
When your mama used to play here...

1016
01:28:35,877 --> 01:28:39,040
she used to sit you right over there
on that stool.

1017
01:28:39,113 --> 01:28:40,705
And you was so cute.

1018
01:28:41,449 --> 01:28:44,612
See, my job was to keep you
full of Shirley Temples.

1019
01:28:45,119 --> 01:28:46,814
You remember that?

1020
01:28:46,888 --> 01:28:49,618
With Junior.
You used to play with Lorraine back then.

1021
01:28:49,691 --> 01:28:51,181
You were in the band, weren't you?

1022
01:28:51,259 --> 01:28:55,593
Yeah, she and Junior was our best night
here, when they wasn't bickering.

1023
01:28:57,031 --> 01:28:58,623
Little Purslane.

1024
01:28:58,700 --> 01:29:01,498
Look, you come back
and see old Tiny again, all right?

1025
01:29:01,569 --> 01:29:04,197
And the Shirley Temples on the house.

1026
01:29:04,639 --> 01:29:06,106
See you later, man.

1027
01:29:07,208 --> 01:29:09,369
You were really in Lorraine's band?

1028
01:29:11,446 --> 01:29:13,073
Of course I was.

1029
01:29:13,648 --> 01:29:17,345
I mean, everybody was at that time.
That's just how it was.

1030
01:29:19,654 --> 01:29:21,451
Lorraine and me...

1031
01:29:22,657 --> 01:29:25,148
we were close at one time.

1032
01:29:29,597 --> 01:29:32,157
I remember the last time
she wore that dress.

1033
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,298
It looks just as pretty on you.

1034
01:29:40,375 --> 01:29:41,740
I gotta go.

1035
01:29:42,543 --> 01:29:44,272
Glad you came, honey.

1036
01:29:46,981 --> 01:29:50,382
Why didn't you tell me
your mama was a singer? That's so cool.

1037
01:29:52,487 --> 01:29:54,751
I don't know. It was a long time ago.

1038
01:29:58,059 --> 01:30:00,584
You want a drink? I'm ready.

1039
01:30:15,042 --> 01:30:18,136
Jesus. Are you anxious to get home?

1040
01:30:18,713 --> 01:30:21,773
Unless you and Purslane
don't want me around anymore.

1041
01:30:21,849 --> 01:30:23,874
You finally figured us out.

1042
01:30:25,186 --> 01:30:27,654
- What's the verdict?
- I got a kidney infection.

1043
01:30:27,722 --> 01:30:29,883
They gave me some medicine.

1044
01:30:30,491 --> 01:30:32,152
Said I got to dry out.

1045
01:30:34,796 --> 01:30:36,263
What about the toe?

1046
01:30:36,364 --> 01:30:39,527
It's just a fungus. Got goop.

1047
01:30:41,736 --> 01:30:44,170
You're a lucky man.
You're gonna be all right.

1048
01:30:44,238 --> 01:30:46,638
Of course I am. But what if I wasn't?

1049
01:30:47,074 --> 01:30:48,439
What do you mean?

1050
01:30:48,509 --> 01:30:51,137
I saw you with Purslane on Christmas Eve.

1051
01:30:52,380 --> 01:30:56,316
- Are you sleeping with her, Lawson?
- No. How could you think that?

1052
01:30:57,185 --> 01:31:00,177
Because she's becoming more fetching
every day.

1053
01:31:00,621 --> 01:31:02,418
Because she's a young woman.

1054
01:31:02,590 --> 01:31:05,718
She's got a crush,
and we both know how nice that is.

1055
01:31:05,793 --> 01:31:08,421
- She's a kid<i>, B</i>obby.
- She's 18.

1056
01:31:09,597 --> 01:31:11,724
My wife was 18 when I met her.

1057
01:31:13,367 --> 01:31:15,335
It was love at first sight.

1058
01:31:16,170 --> 01:31:18,900
Nothing happened. That night...

1059
01:31:19,173 --> 01:31:21,368
things had gotten a little out of hand...

1060
01:31:21,442 --> 01:31:23,808
and I think she was
kind of frightened by it all.

1061
01:31:23,878 --> 01:31:25,903
She was feeling a bit lonely and cold.

1062
01:31:25,980 --> 01:31:29,040
Well, my guess is
that she wasn't the only one.

1063
01:31:30,318 --> 01:31:33,116
Just remember, she's Lorraine's daughter.

1064
01:31:36,491 --> 01:31:38,823
- You're jealous.
- Absolutely.

1065
01:31:40,995 --> 01:31:43,156
Shit, I ain't worth this much.

1066
01:31:45,700 --> 01:31:46,962
Fuck, no.

1067
01:31:53,808 --> 01:31:56,902
<i>Winter never feels truly at home</i>
<i>in New Orleans.</i>

1068
01:31:57,612 --> 01:32:00,376
<i>An unwelcome visitor</i>
<i>that shows up long enough...</i>

1069
01:32:00,448 --> 01:32:02,814
<i>to remind us of what we're missing...</i>

1070
01:32:02,884 --> 01:32:05,717
<i>and leaves us just in time</i>
<i>for us to forget again.</i>

1071
01:32:13,427 --> 01:32:15,657
Spring, and we're still here.

1072
01:32:19,834 --> 01:32:22,667
How about we grab a bottle of wine...

1073
01:32:23,304 --> 01:32:27,104
and go down to the river like we used to?
What do you think of that?

1074
01:32:27,174 --> 01:32:30,268
Remember that very generous girl
who used to skinny-dip?

1075
01:32:30,344 --> 01:32:32,938
- What was her name?
- I don't know.

1076
01:32:33,714 --> 01:32:35,579
She's born-again now.

1077
01:32:41,822 --> 01:32:44,791
Think we'll still be living together
in heaven?

1078
01:32:44,859 --> 01:32:48,226
If we make it to heaven,
then everybody will be there...

1079
01:32:48,296 --> 01:32:50,764
and I'll have my pick
of goddamn debauchers:

1080
01:32:50,831 --> 01:32:52,696
Byron, de Sade, Hemingway.

1081
01:32:52,767 --> 01:32:56,225
I'll be more fun
than all of them whiners put together.

1082
01:32:56,304 --> 01:32:58,204
Yes, I guess you would.

1083
01:32:59,106 --> 01:33:03,042
- I really think Pursey can get financial aid.
- Will you forget that?

1084
01:33:03,144 --> 01:33:07,410
She's gonna go off to some fancy school
after we taught her everything she knows.

1085
01:33:07,481 --> 01:33:10,109
We'll still be sitting here
getting older and uglier...

1086
01:33:10,184 --> 01:33:12,175
and any spring could be our last...

1087
01:33:12,253 --> 01:33:14,813
God damn it, I wanna go to the river now.

1088
01:33:16,190 --> 01:33:18,886
Why are you such a dramatic old bastard?

1089
01:33:19,994 --> 01:33:22,258
"I just want to breathe in every day.

1090
01:33:23,297 --> 01:33:26,994
"Happiness makes up in height
what it lacks in length."

1091
01:33:29,770 --> 01:33:32,739
- Robert Frost.
- Come on.

1092
01:33:33,541 --> 01:33:36,271
You know damn well she'll miss us
if she leaves.

1093
01:33:36,377 --> 01:33:39,540
If she leaves, she's gone.
Final chapter. End of story.

1094
01:33:39,614 --> 01:33:42,105
I want to go to the river now.

1095
01:33:44,752 --> 01:33:47,414
But I need peace and quiet.
I got so much to do...

1096
01:33:47,488 --> 01:33:51,515
to pull off this graduation. I gotta write
a short story, or poem, or something.

1097
01:33:51,592 --> 01:33:52,923
I can't think of anything.

1098
01:33:52,994 --> 01:33:55,656
- I'm gonna blow the whole thing.
- I know you.

1099
01:33:55,763 --> 01:33:58,630
- You'll be fine.
- I'll see you later.

1100
01:34:05,406 --> 01:34:06,703
Hey, babe.

1101
01:34:08,943 --> 01:34:11,070
I've been waiting for you all day.

1102
01:34:11,779 --> 01:34:14,748
Lee, what are you doing here?
How did you find me?

1103
01:34:14,815 --> 01:34:16,305
You smell nice.

1104
01:34:17,518 --> 01:34:20,146
Aren't you gonna ask me in?
I drove all night.

1105
01:34:20,221 --> 01:34:22,621
And I got you this.

1106
01:34:33,434 --> 01:34:35,561
This place really looks like you.

1107
01:34:36,771 --> 01:34:38,363
All those lady magazines...

1108
01:34:38,439 --> 01:34:41,203
I don't read those anymore.
I don't have the time.

1109
01:34:41,275 --> 01:34:43,869
What are you doing now? You waitressing?

1110
01:34:44,345 --> 01:34:47,007
No, I'm... It's none of your business.

1111
01:34:49,583 --> 01:34:52,677
<i>Man, you must be doing okay. No rent...

1112
01:34:52,753 --> 01:34:55,483
and this place definitely kicks ass
over the trailer.

1113
01:34:55,556 --> 01:34:58,252
- Lee, what do you want?
- What do you mean?

1114
01:34:58,826 --> 01:35:01,351
I just came up here
to make sure that you're safe...

1115
01:35:01,429 --> 01:35:05,092
- once Lorraine's fool friends get the boot.
- What are you talking about?

1116
01:35:05,166 --> 01:35:07,964
Those guys
that you had to share this place with.

1117
01:35:08,035 --> 01:35:10,333
How do you know who I live with?

1118
01:35:15,142 --> 01:35:17,406
Some lawyer sent you a letter.

1119
01:35:17,478 --> 01:35:19,708
Which you, of course, opened.

1120
01:35:25,519 --> 01:35:27,453
Their year is almost up...

1121
01:35:29,056 --> 01:35:32,025
and I've been trying really hard
to better myself.

1122
01:35:32,093 --> 01:35:35,688
- I've missed you so much...
- This letter says as of July 1...

1123
01:35:35,763 --> 01:35:38,561
- I'm the sole owner of this house.
- Yeah, I know.

1124
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:42,233
You didn't know that? Jesus Christ, man!

1125
01:35:42,303 --> 01:35:46,262
- Those fucking scumbag losers lied...
- They are not losers. They're my...

1126
01:35:47,108 --> 01:35:49,474
- They're your what?
- You cannot call them losers.

1127
01:35:49,543 --> 01:35:52,341
You think that... I have a real life now.
I go to school...

1128
01:35:52,413 --> 01:35:53,880
- A real life?
- Yeah.

1129
01:35:54,148 --> 01:35:57,345
As opposed to the piece- of-shit life
that we had?

1130
01:35:57,485 --> 01:36:00,318
And I guess you got some real men
in your real life, too.

1131
01:36:00,387 --> 01:36:03,481
Men who lie to girls
so they can have a roof over their heads?

1132
01:36:03,557 --> 01:36:04,649
- Fuck you!
- Or what?

1133
01:36:04,725 --> 01:36:07,660
Are they getting something else
for their trouble?

1134
01:36:08,829 --> 01:36:10,990
They used you, Purslane.

1135
01:36:11,198 --> 01:36:13,928
- Just like they used Lorraine.
- Get out.

1136
01:36:14,235 --> 01:36:17,762
That's just fine!
I came all the way up here to see you!

1137
01:36:19,774 --> 01:36:23,232
You're in school now.
That's some funny stuff.

1138
01:36:24,979 --> 01:36:27,470
I want you
to remember something, Purslane.

1139
01:36:27,848 --> 01:36:30,442
A weed is just a weed...

1140
01:36:31,852 --> 01:36:33,649
no matter how pretty the flower.

1141
01:36:33,721 --> 01:36:36,952
That's just fucking brilliant, Lee. Get out!

1142
01:36:48,869 --> 01:36:50,598
What the hell is going on?

1143
01:36:50,938 --> 01:36:53,406
She must be cleaning or something.

1144
01:36:54,708 --> 01:36:56,335
She locked the door.

1145
01:36:57,711 --> 01:36:59,576
Pursey, open up, honey.

1146
01:37:01,515 --> 01:37:03,039
Pursey, it's us.

1147
01:37:08,255 --> 01:37:09,984
Pursey, honey, open up.

1148
01:37:11,792 --> 01:37:15,626
- You locked the door.
- God damn it, I told you this would happen.

1149
01:37:15,729 --> 01:37:18,630
No. Oh, God. How?

1150
01:37:19,433 --> 01:37:21,663
Let's go. She needs some time.

1151
01:37:25,873 --> 01:37:28,341
Two goddamn days and no one's seen her.

1152
01:37:28,409 --> 01:37:30,343
She asked for the weekend off.

1153
01:37:31,812 --> 01:37:33,473
The trail is exhausted.

1154
01:37:34,381 --> 01:37:38,044
Ray said she came in early this morning.
Used the phone.

1155
01:37:38,285 --> 01:37:40,913
- She snuck past us?
- Probably on purpose.

1156
01:37:41,188 --> 01:37:44,453
You have not been very supportive
in this ordeal.

1157
01:37:46,460 --> 01:37:50,396
You're staying with me, aren't you?
You're welcome to go elsewhere.

1158
01:37:52,566 --> 01:37:54,193
I can rectify this.

1159
01:37:54,902 --> 01:37:58,599
Tomorrow she goes to school.
I'll set the alarm. Get up early.

1160
01:37:59,506 --> 01:38:01,133
Talk to her on the way.

1161
01:38:02,576 --> 01:38:04,476
Work this whole thing out.

1162
01:38:05,980 --> 01:38:07,743
We don't have an alarm.

1163
01:39:07,808 --> 01:39:10,777
Sweetheart, we've been waiting for you.

1164
01:39:16,450 --> 01:39:20,216
What do you think?
It's all your favorite colors.

1165
01:39:20,821 --> 01:39:24,348
And guess who helped?
We had Ray, and lke, and even Earl.

1166
01:39:33,400 --> 01:39:36,927
It'll probably add value to the selling price,
so thanks.

1167
01:40:14,041 --> 01:40:16,532
Don't know why you have to go so soon.

1168
01:40:17,611 --> 01:40:20,739
We'll still be friends.
It's them I wanna get away from.

1169
01:40:22,483 --> 01:40:24,508
You know they didn't mean to hurt you...

1170
01:40:24,585 --> 01:40:28,112
Why don't you start off in the kitchen?
I'll finish this.

1171
01:41:23,744 --> 01:41:25,268
<i>"My sweet Purslane...</i>

1172
01:41:26,113 --> 01:41:28,843
<i>"I am getting well and can't wait to see you.</i>

1173
01:41:29,550 --> 01:41:32,280
<i>"Time seems to stand still in these places...</i>

1174
01:41:32,352 --> 01:41:36,186
<i>"but somehow too much of it has passed,</i>
<i>and there's so much to say.</i>

1175
01:41:36,290 --> 01:41:40,556
<i>"I write to you always, but</i>
<i>never have the courage to send my letters.</i>

1176
01:41:40,761 --> 01:41:44,128
<i>"I want you to have them now</i>
<i>to give you our history.</i>

1177
01:41:44,965 --> 01:41:47,195
<i>"I'd like you to know your daddy...</i>

1178
01:41:47,267 --> 01:41:51,636
<i>"and to know that only I'm to blame for</i>
<i>the fact that he doesn't already know you.</i>

1179
01:41:53,073 --> 01:41:55,166
<i>"I wrote this song for you both."</i>

1180
01:42:11,291 --> 01:42:14,385
Honey, where do you want me
to put your glasses?

1181
01:42:18,765 --> 01:42:20,130
What's wrong?

1182
01:42:20,868 --> 01:42:24,599
How could you talk about her all the time
and never tell me this?

1183
01:42:29,543 --> 01:42:31,010
Is this true?

1184
01:42:36,316 --> 01:42:39,376
"Your singing touched my soul.
Bobby Long."

1185
01:42:42,022 --> 01:42:44,855
I always suspected, but she never told me.

1186
01:42:46,460 --> 01:42:48,428
I loved her first.

1187
01:42:48,495 --> 01:42:51,259
And Bobby got here,
and all hell broke loose.

1188
01:42:52,065 --> 01:42:54,056
Bobby was still married.

1189
01:42:55,302 --> 01:42:57,668
He never even knew how she felt.

1190
01:43:00,908 --> 01:43:03,274
She worked so hard to get clean.

1191
01:43:05,779 --> 01:43:10,682
And when she did, she came home
for a big show at the Howlin' Wolf.

1192
01:43:12,719 --> 01:43:13,947
This show?

1193
01:43:18,292 --> 01:43:19,919
The date's right.

1194
01:43:21,695 --> 01:43:24,528
She said your grandma would bring you up.

1195
01:43:28,302 --> 01:43:31,931
You never did show. He never did, either.

1196
01:43:32,839 --> 01:43:36,434
Boy, she was devastated
neither one of you was there.

1197
01:43:38,145 --> 01:43:39,612
"To my sweet Bobby.

1198
01:43:40,347 --> 01:43:44,408
"I am feeling better and coming home
to sing you a brand-new song.

1199
01:43:45,118 --> 01:43:49,316
"Please come. Someone I love will be there
and I want to introduce you."

1200
01:43:52,092 --> 01:43:53,992
This was you, darling.

1201
01:43:56,630 --> 01:43:58,097
You and Bobby.

1202
01:44:01,935 --> 01:44:03,163
I just...

1203
01:44:05,472 --> 01:44:07,167
I can't believe it.

1204
01:45:14,541 --> 01:45:17,009
Why do you keep drinking that shit?

1205
01:45:17,077 --> 01:45:20,308
Don't you know it's gonna kill you?
Didn't you watch Lorraine?

1206
01:45:20,380 --> 01:45:23,611
God, sometimes you make me
so fucking sick.

1207
01:45:23,717 --> 01:45:26,049
You're living in some fantasy world...

1208
01:45:26,119 --> 01:45:29,247
where life's a book
and no one takes responsibility for writing.

1209
01:45:29,323 --> 01:45:33,657
Every idiot knows that books are better
than life. That's why they're books!

1210
01:45:38,298 --> 01:45:41,392
Pursey, honey,
you go right ahead and be wicked.

1211
01:45:41,468 --> 01:45:42,958
We deserve it.

1212
01:45:43,670 --> 01:45:48,334
But when you're finished, why don't
we just all sit down and talk like a family?

1213
01:45:49,643 --> 01:45:51,167
Like a family.

1214
01:45:51,945 --> 01:45:54,209
Would that be like
that family you destroyed?

1215
01:45:54,281 --> 01:45:56,408
Are we just gonna be like that family?

1216
01:45:56,483 --> 01:46:00,510
'Cause the weird thing is that,
a<i>cc</i>ording to Lorraine, I am your family.

1217
01:46:06,193 --> 01:46:08,661
Couldn't you count to nine months?

1218
01:46:12,332 --> 01:46:15,961
I never understood
why she would want me to live with y'all...

1219
01:46:29,549 --> 01:46:31,346
but you're my father.

1220
01:46:44,331 --> 01:46:45,662
I just...

1221
01:46:54,141 --> 01:46:55,665
Did you love her?

1222
01:46:59,346 --> 01:47:03,680
- Did you love her?
- Yes, very much. But I just...

1223
01:47:07,354 --> 01:47:09,185
I wish we never knew.

1224
01:47:11,358 --> 01:47:14,088
No. Don't go, Pursey.

1225
01:47:16,363 --> 01:47:17,955
Don't walk away.

1226
01:47:18,031 --> 01:47:20,659
- It's too late.
- No, it's not too late.

1227
01:47:21,334 --> 01:47:24,826
You got me now, honey.
You're not alone anymore.

1228
01:47:27,941 --> 01:47:29,465
Let me be here.

1229
01:47:30,710 --> 01:47:32,905
What can I do? Tell me.

1230
01:47:36,049 --> 01:47:37,380
What, honey?

1231
01:47:37,451 --> 01:47:40,181
Remember when I told you
I made up memories about her?

1232
01:47:40,253 --> 01:47:41,242
Yes.

1233
01:47:43,957 --> 01:47:48,394
The really pathetic part was that
I used to make up memories about myself.

1234
01:47:49,162 --> 01:47:52,620
Like parents got lots of stories
about their kids.

1235
01:47:53,467 --> 01:47:57,961
You know, like, "Wasn't it cute when
Suzie couldn't say supercalifucking..."

1236
01:47:58,038 --> 01:47:59,300
Whatever.

1237
01:48:00,307 --> 01:48:03,606
I mean, people remember a lot of weird shit.

1238
01:48:03,677 --> 01:48:06,840
Like you probably got a ton of stories
about your kids, right?

1239
01:48:06,913 --> 01:48:08,244
Yes, I do.

1240
01:48:09,082 --> 01:48:12,279
Well, I kind of felt that maybe...

1241
01:48:13,086 --> 01:48:16,715
I used to do some cute or funny stuff
when I was little.

1242
01:48:17,824 --> 01:48:21,920
But the truth is nobody was really there
watching, were they?

1243
01:48:21,995 --> 01:48:26,227
Honey, I was there. Sweetheart, I was there.

1244
01:48:26,633 --> 01:48:29,693
I saw. It was never very long,
but I was there.

1245
01:48:31,571 --> 01:48:33,505
- Will you tell me about her?
- Yes.

1246
01:48:33,573 --> 01:48:35,939
- Every tiny thing about her?
- Oh, yes.

1247
01:48:36,009 --> 01:48:37,601
And about me, too?

1248
01:48:38,378 --> 01:48:41,905
'Cause I think I really need to know now.

1249
01:48:44,651 --> 01:48:45,640
Yes.

1250
01:48:46,119 --> 01:48:49,646
I don't want to sell our house.
I love our house. I just...

1251
01:48:49,723 --> 01:48:51,486
I was so mad at you.

1252
01:48:54,194 --> 01:48:55,661
I'm so sorry.

1253
01:49:07,807 --> 01:49:10,435
I don't remember how to do this.

1254
01:49:11,811 --> 01:49:13,540
I'll do it for you.

1255
01:49:14,381 --> 01:49:16,576
Shit, man. Your foot's blue.

1256
01:49:19,352 --> 01:49:23,721
I've been practicing wearing this shoe.
It's just numb, is all.

1257
01:49:31,431 --> 01:49:35,561
I don't want any reason for my daughter
to be ashamed of her daddy.

1258
01:49:36,102 --> 01:49:38,434
- Now, how do I look?
- Damn good.

1259
01:49:38,772 --> 01:49:42,765
- How do I look?
- Well, pretty good.

1260
01:49:44,144 --> 01:49:46,112
Your hair's sticking up.

1261
01:49:47,614 --> 01:49:49,081
There you go.

1262
01:49:54,654 --> 01:49:57,680
Good Lord, y'all look like regular taxpayers.

1263
01:49:57,757 --> 01:50:01,193
<i>- Maybe I ain't dressed appropriate.
- You look fine.

1264
01:50:01,261 --> 01:50:04,321
Your fly is down.
Come on, we're gonna be late.

1265
01:50:06,132 --> 01:50:08,965
Are you ready
to see our daughter graduate?

1266
01:50:09,269 --> 01:50:10,827
Yes, I am, sir.

1267
01:50:12,005 --> 01:50:15,532
- It's a day to count our blessings.
- Yes.

1268
01:51:18,972 --> 01:51:21,566
Quiet, everybody. Quiet down.

1269
01:51:22,208 --> 01:51:24,438
I'd like to propose a toast...

1270
01:51:25,345 --> 01:51:29,782
to my very beautiful daughter,
Purslane Hominy...

1271
01:51:30,383 --> 01:51:32,908
who is my very own golden girl.

1272
01:51:34,454 --> 01:51:38,914
Cecil mentioned earlier that today
was a day we should count our blessings.

1273
01:51:40,093 --> 01:51:43,688
And as I look around,
I see that there are many...

1274
01:51:44,364 --> 01:51:46,696
that I have not given credence to.

1275
01:51:48,802 --> 01:51:52,795
I am thankful for a God
that I had thought had given up on me...

1276
01:51:54,140 --> 01:51:57,667
and the love of a child who, God willing...

1277
01:51:59,012 --> 01:52:01,207
will be in college this fall.

1278
01:52:01,281 --> 01:52:05,445
And not no Vinegar Bend Junior College,
neither. My baby's smart.

1279
01:52:05,985 --> 01:52:07,919
Smarter than her old man.

1280
01:52:07,987 --> 01:52:09,955
That's for goddamn sure.

1281
01:52:10,957 --> 01:52:14,688
Pursey, honey, you have taught
this old fool a thing or two.

1282
01:52:14,861 --> 01:52:17,659
And in the glorious words of T.S. Eliot:

1283
01:52:19,099 --> 01:52:21,431
"We shall not cease exploration.

1284
01:52:23,203 --> 01:52:25,569
"And at the end of all our exploring...

1285
01:52:25,905 --> 01:52:28,965
"will be to arrive where we started...

1286
01:52:29,943 --> 01:52:32,810
"and know the place for the first time."

1287
01:52:34,347 --> 01:52:37,214
And that's what you've given your old man.

1288
01:52:38,718 --> 01:52:40,549
And he is forever grateful.

1289
01:52:41,154 --> 01:52:44,487
Now<i>, c</i>ome on up
and give your old man an Alabama shuffle.

1290
01:52:48,261 --> 01:52:50,752
Play that slow one that I asked for.

1291
01:54:06,906 --> 01:54:11,309
<i>Some people reach a place in time</i>
<i>where they've gone as far as they can...</i>

1292
01:54:11,477 --> 01:54:15,038
<i>the place where wives and jobs</i>
<i>collide with desire...</i>

1293
01:54:15,114 --> 01:54:18,845
<i>that which is unknowable,</i>
<i>and those who remain out of sight.</i>

1294
01:54:20,520 --> 01:54:23,978
<i>"See what is invisible,</i>
<i>and you will see what to write. "</i>

1295
01:54:25,825 --> 01:54:28,157
<i>That's how Bobby used to put it.</i>

1296
01:54:28,294 --> 01:54:31,559
<i>It was the invisible people</i>
<i>he wanted to live with.</i>

1297
01:54:31,664 --> 01:54:34,394
<i>The ones that we walk past every day.</i>

1298
01:54:34,467 --> 01:54:36,697
<i>The ones we sometimes become.</i>

1299
01:54:37,036 --> 01:54:40,870
<i>The ones in books</i>
<i>who live only in someone's mind's eye.</i>

1300
01:54:42,976 --> 01:54:46,639
<i>He was a man who was destined</i>
<i>to go through life and not around it.</i>

1301
01:54:47,480 --> 01:54:51,576
<i>A man who was sure the shortest path</i>
<i>to heaven was straight through hell.</i>

1302
01:54:53,553 --> 01:54:55,612
<i>But the truth of his handicap...</i>

1303
01:54:55,722 --> 01:55:00,386
<i>lay only in a mind both exalted</i>
<i>and crippled by too many stories...</i>

1304
01:55:00,927 --> 01:55:03,452
<i>and the path he chose to become one.</i>

1305
01:55:05,131 --> 01:55:09,033
<i>Bobby Long's tragic flaw</i>
<i>was his romance with all that he saw.</i>

1306
01:55:10,536 --> 01:55:14,097
<i>And I guess if people want to believe</i>
<i>in some form of justice...</i>

1307
01:55:14,173 --> 01:55:16,937
<i>then Bobby Long got his for a song.</i>
