00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:28,798
Are you all right?
Shit really hitted the fan.

2
00:00:29,207 --> 00:00:30,683
That's a whole different study.

3
00:00:30,683 --> 00:00:33,262
But if we knew that, we could...

4
00:00:33,263 --> 00:00:35,065
We don't know that!

5
00:00:35,151 --> 00:00:36,905
We gotta operate with
what we do know!

6
00:00:37,608 --> 00:00:40,202
- I'm still dreaming.
- No, you're not.

7
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:46,256
My turn with the coat.

8
00:00:46,568 --> 00:00:47,833
I'm triying to explain
exclusively the facts...

9
00:00:47,834 --> 00:00:52,149
The guys on the crew are going crazy.
A couple of 'em flown the coop already.

10
00:00:52,692 --> 00:00:55,927
I don't know how long
we can stay on the air!

11
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:02,857
Ok, check that camera!
Who has camera two?

12
00:01:03,165 --> 00:01:05,220
Who the hell's on camera 2,
a blind man?

13
00:01:07,521 --> 00:01:09,968
Roll the rescue...
Roll the rescue stations!

14
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:13,196
Got a report that half those stations
have been knocked out.

15
00:01:13,346 --> 00:01:16,062
- Get me another list!
- Sure, I'll just pull it outta my ass, right?

16
00:01:16,559 --> 00:01:17,231
I don't believe that, doctor.

17
00:01:17,232 --> 00:01:19,798
- Do you believe the dead are returning to life?
- I'm not so...

18
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:21,908
Do you believe the dead are returning
to life and attacking the living?

19
00:01:21,908 --> 00:01:23,916
I'm not so sure what
to believe, doctor

20
00:01:23,999 --> 00:01:26,466
All we get is what you people tell us.
And it's hard enough to believe...

21
00:01:26,727 --> 00:01:27,727
It's fact...! It's fact...!

22
00:01:27,728 --> 00:01:30,267
It's hard enough to believe
without you coming in here...

23
00:01:30,268 --> 00:01:33,073
You're not running a
talk-show here, Mr. Berman!

24
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:36,894
You can forget pitching an audience
the moral bullshit they wanna hear!

25
00:01:36,895 --> 00:01:38,919
You're talking about abandoning
any human code of behaviour...

26
00:01:42,767 --> 00:01:46,549
Frannie, get on the new list of rescue stations.
Charlie's receiving it on the emergency room.

27
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:51,567
- Rescue stations list?
- Half of those are inoperatives as of now.

28
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:55,235
Charlie, these are rescue stations.
We can't send people to inoperative rescue stations.

29
00:01:55,235 --> 00:01:58,570
We've had old information on the air
for the last 12 hours.

30
00:02:12,195 --> 00:02:14,261
- Kill the old ones.
- Givens wants to!

31
00:02:14,261 --> 00:02:15,798
Kill'em Dick! Tell
Givens to see me!

32
00:02:16,253 --> 00:02:19,365
... public figures like
yourself that this situation is been...

33
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:20,399
... you're
not telling me...

34
00:02:20,461 --> 00:02:21,497
... by the public

35
00:02:21,997 --> 00:02:23,337
You're not listening!

36
00:02:23,414 --> 00:02:26,304
You're not listening!
We've this situation for the last 3 weeks...

37
00:02:26,304 --> 00:02:28,146
What does it take?

38
00:02:28,151 --> 00:02:31,013
What does it take
to make people see?

39
00:02:31,016 --> 00:02:32,460
People aren't willing to accept
your solutions, doctor.

40
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,152
And I don't blame them!

41
00:02:34,345 --> 00:02:39,433
Every dead body that is not
exterminated becomes one of them.

42
00:02:39,462 --> 00:02:41,553
It gets up and kills.

43
00:02:41,553 --> 00:02:44,107
The people it kills
get up and kill!

44
00:02:48,122 --> 00:02:49,720
Dave!

45
00:02:54,445 --> 00:02:55,845
Sit down and type that up.

46
00:02:58,368 --> 00:03:00,031
You're dropping my question.
I think Foster is right. We're loosen it.

47
00:03:00,279 --> 00:03:02,109
Yeah, we're blowing it ourselves.

48
00:03:04,671 --> 00:03:07,061
A dead body must be exterminated.

49
00:03:07,151 --> 00:03:11,600
Either by destroying the brain or severing
the brain from the rest of the body.

50
00:03:11,937 --> 00:03:15,951
- You must be out of your mind!
- This situation must be controlled before is too late.

51
00:03:17,434 --> 00:03:19,015
...multiplying too rapidly!

52
00:03:19,497 --> 00:03:21,493
What the hell is going on?
Who kill those supers?

53
00:03:24,131 --> 00:03:25,710
Frannie, who told you to
kill those supers?

54
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,947
Nobody. I killed it.
They are outdated.

55
00:03:28,516 --> 00:03:29,194
Do you know you're on air?

56
00:03:29,671 --> 00:03:30,412
What the hell is going on?

57
00:03:30,902 --> 00:03:33,335
I want those supers on
the air all the time.

58
00:03:33,335 --> 00:03:35,811
Without those rescues
stations on screen...

59
00:03:35,811 --> 00:03:38,566
every minute people won't
watch us. So they'll tune out!

60
00:03:38,634 --> 00:03:42,600
Are you willing to murder people
by sending them out to
stations that haved closed down

61
00:03:42,813 --> 00:03:45,360
I want that list up on the screen
every minute that we're on the air!

62
00:03:45,585 --> 00:03:47,875
- Anybody need a ride?
- What the hell are you doing?

63
00:03:47,937 --> 00:03:49,387
Get back on this console!

64
00:03:49,883 --> 00:03:51,995
What is this? A news show or
a football game?

65
00:03:52,104 --> 00:03:53,637
Get that idiot off the air!

66
00:03:56,843 --> 00:03:58,834
Officer, stop those men!

67
00:03:59,075 --> 00:04:01,416
Lucas, get back on this console!

68
00:04:01,855 --> 00:04:03,053
Damn!

69
00:04:04,488 --> 00:04:06,175
Get somebody in here that
can run this thing.

70
00:04:06,672 --> 00:04:08,315
Get that fucking idiot off the air!

71
00:04:09,066 --> 00:04:10,420
Get that fucking idiot off the air!

72
00:04:10,421 --> 00:04:12,705
Triple pay!
We're staying on the air!

73
00:04:12,736 --> 00:04:15,248
Fuck off! Fuck off!

74
00:04:15,443 --> 00:04:19,486
Now, Doctor Foster. The public
needs facts. What do you have
to give us?

75
00:04:19,898 --> 00:04:22,713
They kill for one reason.
They kill for food.

76
00:04:23,213 --> 00:04:25,393
They eat their victims.
You understand that, Mr. Berman?

77
00:04:25,394 --> 00:04:27,341
That's what keeps them going.

78
00:04:27,897 --> 00:04:32,781
If we listened... If we dealt with
this phenomenom properly
without emotion.

79
00:04:32,781 --> 00:04:35,029
Without emotion!

80
00:04:35,161 --> 00:04:37,324
It wouldn't have come to this!

81
00:04:37,668 --> 00:04:43,709
There is a martial law state in Philadelphia,
as in all major cities in the country.

82
00:04:46,149 --> 00:04:47,613
Where's your badge?

83
00:04:47,724 --> 00:04:48,177
Take it easy...

84
00:04:48,677 --> 00:04:51,125
It's just crazy!
It's just completely insane!

85
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:56,621
Shit! I ain't...
Yeah, here's my badge.

86
00:04:56,622 --> 00:04:57,875
OK, you can go.

87
00:04:59,197 --> 00:05:01,613
Should we be unable
to check the spread.

88
00:05:01,614 --> 00:05:05,343
Because of the emotional attitude
of the citizens because these issues of morality.

89
00:05:05,344 --> 00:05:06,570
Jim, you take it!

90
00:05:06,571 --> 00:05:09,804
It is the order of the O.E.P...

91
00:05:09,805 --> 00:05:11,481
by command of the federal goverment...

92
00:05:11,482 --> 00:05:13,450
the president of the United States

93
00:05:13,451 --> 00:05:19,985
Citizens may no longer occupy private
residences no matter how safely protected...

94
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,188
or well stocked.

95
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:25,188
Citizens will be moved into central
areas of the city.

96
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:26,823
The bodies of the dead...

97
00:05:26,824 --> 00:05:31,494
will be delivered over to
special squads of the national guard...

98
00:05:31,495 --> 00:05:33,977
for organised disposition.

99
00:05:37,495 --> 00:05:39,658
Frannie, meet me on the roof
at 9 o'clock. We're getting out.

100
00:05:39,854 --> 00:05:40,659
I don't believe it...

101
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,183
We're gonna get out!
In the chopper.

102
00:05:42,184 --> 00:05:44,195
- Stephen, we can't. We got...
- Careful!

103
00:05:46,952 --> 00:05:48,857
- Nine p.m., all right.
- Stephen, we can't. We got...

104
00:05:49,193 --> 00:05:52,185
We got to nothing, Fran.
We've got to survive.

105
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:53,566
Somebody's got to survive.

106
00:05:53,567 --> 00:05:56,429
Now you'd be up stairs at 9.
Don't make me come lookin' for ya.

107
00:05:57,403 --> 00:06:01,259
Go ahead. We'll be off the air by midnight.
Emergency networks are taking over.

108
00:06:02,591 --> 00:06:06,138
Our responsability is finished.

109
00:06:13,681 --> 00:06:15,563
Martinez!

110
00:06:16,565 --> 00:06:20,199
You've been watching. You know we
got this building surrounded.

111
00:06:21,736 --> 00:06:26,056
The bastard's got them moved into
one building. Dumb little bastard!

112
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:27,741
Looks like they're really gonna
try to fight us.

113
00:06:30,006 --> 00:06:31,214
- C'mon!
- Martinez.

114
00:06:32,735 --> 00:06:35,939
People in this project
are your responsability.

115
00:06:36,082 --> 00:06:38,701
We don't want any of them hurt
and neither do you!

116
00:06:38,702 --> 00:06:40,338
I'm giving you 3 minutes, Martinez.

117
00:06:40,339 --> 00:06:43,300
I'm giving you 3 minutes, Martinez.

118
00:06:43,301 --> 00:06:46,073
Turn over your weapons
and surrender.

119
00:06:46,074 --> 00:06:47,752
There're no charges against you.

120
00:06:47,753 --> 00:06:51,215
There are no charges against you or
any of your people.

121
00:06:52,244 --> 00:06:53,244
Yet.

122
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,120
C'mon, Martinez.

123
00:06:56,121 --> 00:06:58,850
Yeah, C'mon Martinez. Show your
greasy little puerto rican ass...

124
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:00,038
so I can blow it right off.

125
00:07:01,273 --> 00:07:03,177
I'll blow all their asses off.

126
00:07:03,178 --> 00:07:07,902
Low life bastards. Blow all their
little low life puerto rican and
nigger asses rigth off!

127
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:11,134
- You're right?
- I'm right Roger.

128
00:07:11,135 --> 00:07:15,508
How the hell come we
stick with these low lifes in these
big ass fancy hotels anyway?

129
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:20,597
Shit man! This' better than I got.
You ain't gonna talk 'em outta here.
You gotta blow'em out!

130
00:07:20,598 --> 00:07:24,252
Just stay cool, ok? When you go
in there just don't pop off, all right?

131
00:07:24,613 --> 00:07:26,545
- I'll be ok.
- C'mon!

132
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:28,658
Let's get on with it!
This is a waste of my time!

133
00:07:29,594 --> 00:07:30,987
Let's go! Let's go!

134
00:07:36,136 --> 00:07:37,598
Move it! Move it!

135
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:38,786
Goddamitt!

136
00:07:40,869 --> 00:07:43,046
C'mon, you dumb bastards!
Come and get 'em!

137
00:07:43,179 --> 00:07:45,621
Bishop, try to kill a thousand pigs!

138
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:58,941
Get 'em out of the road!

139
00:07:59,975 --> 00:08:01,198
People, look out!

140
00:08:13,215 --> 00:08:14,644
Hold it!

141
00:08:19,002 --> 00:08:20,564
Don't go out there!

142
00:08:25,866 --> 00:08:26,560
Masks!

143
00:08:27,559 --> 00:08:30,174
Masks for the gas!
Masks for the gas!

144
00:08:35,578 --> 00:08:41,033
Work your way down.
C'mon, work your way down!

145
00:08:41,034 --> 00:08:43,637
One floor at a time.
Keep going!

146
00:08:43,638 --> 00:08:44,638
Hold 'em in the halls.
Hold 'em in the halls!

147
00:08:45,967 --> 00:08:46,958
- Stay there!
- Damn!

148
00:08:54,232 --> 00:08:57,783
James, slow down!
No, let me go!

149
00:08:59,561 --> 00:09:02,727
C'mon, you little bastards!

150
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,709
Wooley's gone ape shit, man!

151
00:09:13,175 --> 00:09:15,187
- Wooley!
- Hey, hey, hey!

152
00:09:16,381 --> 00:09:17,381
Gimme a hand!

153
00:09:19,447 --> 00:09:21,028
- Gimme a hand!
- Leave me alone, man!

154
00:09:25,323 --> 00:09:27,350
What the hell!
Leave me alone!

155
00:09:27,827 --> 00:09:28,815
Gimme a hand... Somebody...!

156
00:09:29,395 --> 00:09:30,882
Step away from him!

157
00:09:31,864 --> 00:09:34,470
Goddammit!... Help me.
He's crazy!

158
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,074
Step away from him.

159
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,749
Not that room!
Don't enter that room!

160
00:10:20,357 --> 00:10:21,984
Holy Christ!

161
00:10:23,701 --> 00:10:25,018
C'mon, for chrissake!

162
00:10:29,554 --> 00:10:30,862
Shoot him, man.

163
00:10:33,714 --> 00:10:36,393
Shoot him, man.
Shoot him in the head!

164
00:10:52,948 --> 00:10:54,400
It's one of them!

165
00:11:23,019 --> 00:11:25,173
- Miguelito!
- Shoot him!

166
00:11:25,174 --> 00:11:27,485
- Dios mío... Miguel!
- Hold it!

167
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:29,736
- Watch the girl!
- Miguel!

168
00:11:31,151 --> 00:11:33,824
Mi vida... Miguelito...

169
00:11:39,273 --> 00:11:42,048
Stand clear, for chrissake, stand clear!

170
00:12:07,063 --> 00:12:11,267
You're in still one piece
in body and soul, boy

171
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,847
You were in Woley's unit.
Wasn't you?

172
00:12:22,153 --> 00:12:27,184
I didn't see nothing.
I didn't see how he died.

173
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,078
You running?

174
00:13:08,004 --> 00:13:12,840
I don't mean because of Woley.
I mean 'cause of all this...

175
00:13:12,841 --> 00:13:14,552
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

176
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:22,071
Man, there's a lot of people runnin' out.

177
00:13:23,621 --> 00:13:25,726
I could run.

178
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:32,518
I could run rigth tonight.

179
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:47,192
Friend of mine got this helicopter.
He ask me to come with him.

180
00:13:48,274 --> 00:13:50,161
You think it's right to run?

181
00:13:59,982 --> 00:14:03,551
Señores, please to let me pass.

182
00:14:04,198 --> 00:14:05,848
Let's get him to the medics.

183
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:09,286
No, no please.

184
00:14:09,997 --> 00:14:14,525
Just let me pass. I go up to
seven floor to find my sister.

185
00:14:14,526 --> 00:14:16,344
Just let me pass.

186
00:14:16,345 --> 00:14:19,244
The people of 107 will do
what you wish now.

187
00:14:25,234 --> 00:14:33,830
Many have died on the streets last week.
In the basement of this building you find them.

188
00:14:34,138 --> 00:14:40,131
I have givem them the last rites.
Now... You do what you will.

189
00:14:40,132 --> 00:14:48,157
You're stronger than us. But sooner
I think they'll be stronger than you.

190
00:14:52,717 --> 00:15:01,203
When the dead walk, señores,
we must stop the killing... Or loose the war.

191
00:15:10,004 --> 00:15:13,580
C'mon open up!
Get in! Get in!

192
00:17:13,964 --> 00:17:15,670
Jesus Christ!

193
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:19,768
- Hey, you ok down there?
- Yeah

194
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:22,316
This must be where they
dumped 'em in. Huh?

195
00:17:23,289 --> 00:17:26,033
- You need more men?
- No is all done, man.

196
00:17:26,441 --> 00:17:28,417
Is all been done.

197
00:17:28,867 --> 00:17:31,149
Jesus Christ.

198
00:17:39,507 --> 00:17:42,687
Why did these people keep 'em here?

199
00:17:42,688 --> 00:17:47,241
'Cause they still believe
there's respect in dying.

200
00:18:03,011 --> 00:18:04,803
C'mon, I need you.

201
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:10,481
I don't see Roger. We'll
give him ten minutes.

202
00:18:10,482 --> 00:18:11,520
Steve!

203
00:18:15,522 --> 00:18:17,051
I know.

204
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:23,029
Just wait right here.

205
00:18:38,971 --> 00:18:43,369
Just like that. Like in the car.
Just hold her 'til she spits out right at you.

206
00:18:47,865 --> 00:18:49,663
Dispatch come in.

207
00:18:58,636 --> 00:19:01,301
Emergency call to Police Stop.

208
00:19:19,004 --> 00:19:21,967
Hello HQ, this is Police Stop.

209
00:19:22,638 --> 00:19:27,125
Operator's dead. Post abandon.

210
00:19:33,507 --> 00:19:34,986
Steven

211
00:19:37,003 --> 00:19:39,427
- I hope is Roger.
- What are you doing?

212
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:40,057
I'll be right there.

213
00:19:47,444 --> 00:19:48,869
Just stay cool.

214
00:19:49,859 --> 00:19:51,464
Hello.

215
00:19:51,465 --> 00:19:54,679
C'mon skipper.
They got friends coming.

216
00:20:00,207 --> 00:20:00,818
Who are you?

217
00:20:00,818 --> 00:20:03,279
- We're with J.A.S. We...
- About a minute and a half on the car.

218
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:10,527
Now wait a minute. We're
just here to refuel.

219
00:20:10,089 --> 00:20:14,292
Those men were already dead.
You were here... You know that.

220
00:20:14,292 --> 00:20:17,353
Hey, you're J.A.S. Traffic Watch.
Steve Andrews.

221
00:20:17,354 --> 00:20:19,204
Right. That's me.
I'm Steve Andrews.

222
00:20:19,205 --> 00:20:22,360
- Yep, no shit.
- We got a lot further in this bird, Skipper.

223
00:20:22,361 --> 00:20:23,541
Can't all fit.

224
00:20:23,769 --> 00:20:25,009
How many will that thing hold?

225
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:27,694
Hey man, I ain't nowhere in nothin'
I can't drive myself!

226
00:20:27,695 --> 00:20:32,552
That's true! Somethin' happens
to him and we'll be stuck!

227
00:20:32,553 --> 00:20:33,988
Stick with the boat!

228
00:20:33,989 --> 00:20:36,962
- We get a lot further in this bird!
- Hey that's a squad car!

229
00:20:37,846 --> 00:20:39,347
It's okay, we're police.

230
00:20:39,468 --> 00:20:42,308
Bullshit, man! Let's
get to the boat!

231
00:20:44,383 --> 00:20:46,556
You're runnin', ain't it?

232
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:50,104
You and your friends are runnin'
in the J.A.S. Traffic bird.

233
00:20:55,208 --> 00:21:00,227
- What's the problem, officer?
- Caught your friends here stealin' company gasoline.

234
00:21:00,555 --> 00:21:01,730
What do you mean friends?

235
00:21:01,731 --> 00:21:04,609
They know, Rog...
They runnin' to.

236
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:08,411
Now, it'd be crazy to start shootin'
one at another. Wouldn't it?

237
00:21:08,412 --> 00:21:09,525
Sure would.

238
00:21:23,412 --> 00:21:24,606
You guys are ok?

239
00:21:24,654 --> 00:21:26,129
Who's he?

240
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:28,901
His name is Peter. He's alright.
C'mon let's hustle.

241
00:21:31,396 --> 00:21:35,810
Hey, you guys. You better move out.
There's a report on the dock bein' knocked out.

242
00:21:35,811 --> 00:21:37,277
Right. Good luck squad!

243
00:21:37,278 --> 00:21:38,809
You sure this'll carry us all?

244
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:41,392
Little harder on the fuel,
but we'll be ok.

245
00:21:43,828 --> 00:21:46,089
Hey, you got any cigarettes?

246
00:21:47,116 --> 00:21:48,279
Any of you got cigarettes?

247
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:51,100
No, sorry.

248
00:21:52,361 --> 00:21:53,232
Where do you headed?

249
00:21:53,436 --> 00:21:56,991
Down river... We got an idea maybe we
can make it to the islands.

250
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,351
What islands?

251
00:21:59,216 --> 00:22:00,539
Any islands.

252
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,251
What about you?
Where you headed?

253
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,613
Straight up.

254
00:22:14,394 --> 00:22:15,857
Didn't have any cigarettes!

255
00:22:16,453 --> 00:22:18,930
- How do I have a cigarette?
- I don't know

256
00:22:18,931 --> 00:22:20,449
Hey, any of you got cigarettes?

257
00:22:32,805 --> 00:22:37,783
- How I gonna go to the islands
if I don't have cigarettes?

258
00:22:38,801 --> 00:22:40,082
Any of you leavin' people behind?

259
00:22:40,739 --> 00:22:41,934
An ex-husband.

260
00:22:41,935 --> 00:22:43,212
An ex-wife.

261
00:22:43,213 --> 00:22:44,287
You Peter?

262
00:22:44,443 --> 00:22:45,734
Some brothers.

263
00:22:59,427 --> 00:23:01,004
Those... real brothers?

264
00:23:03,357 --> 00:23:05,636
You know... real brothers
or street brothers?

265
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:09,399
Both.

266
00:23:11,009 --> 00:23:12,511
How many real ones?

267
00:23:13,401 --> 00:23:14,511
Two.

268
00:23:16,909 --> 00:23:18,766
Two?

269
00:23:23,248 --> 00:23:28,781
One's in jail... The other's a
pro ball player.

270
00:23:30,612 --> 00:23:33,251
But we catch up to each other
once in a while.

271
00:23:35,152 --> 00:23:36,700
Is he your man?

272
00:23:37,693 --> 00:23:39,821
Most of the time, yes.

273
00:23:42,134 --> 00:23:44,657
Just like to know
who everybody is.

274
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,044
Yeah, me too.

275
00:23:58,535 --> 00:24:00,059
Any more water?

276
00:24:06,744 --> 00:24:07,698
You know where we are?

277
00:24:08,699 --> 00:24:10,320
Yeah, I know exactly
where we are.

278
00:24:10,321 --> 00:24:11,516
Harrisburg?

279
00:24:11,517 --> 00:24:12,659
We passed it about an hour ago.

280
00:24:20,346 --> 00:24:23,390
Jesus. It's everywhere.

281
00:24:25,613 --> 00:24:27,233
Still pretty close to Johnston.

282
00:24:27,234 --> 00:24:29,938
Those rednecks are probably
enjoying the whole thing.

283
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,374
- Is that you again?
- My boy...!

284
00:24:38,375 --> 00:24:40,420
- Keep movin'! Keep movin'!
- Hey ya, check it out!

285
00:24:43,306 --> 00:24:46,106
I heard that by
10 o'clock we've briefing.

286
00:24:51,842 --> 00:24:52,883
I got a couple extra watches...

287
00:24:52,884 --> 00:24:53,945
Didn't they say when?

288
00:24:58,493 --> 00:25:00,847
Great job. You did a great job!

289
00:25:00,848 --> 00:25:01,834
Keep going, keep going.

290
00:25:28,584 --> 00:25:29,892
Look out! Behind you!

291
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:31,920
Down! Get out of the way!

292
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,482
There! Behind the white car!

293
00:25:38,385 --> 00:25:39,653
Get the gas tank.

294
00:25:52,267 --> 00:25:53,452
- Shit!
- Yeah!

295
00:25:54,309 --> 00:25:55,413
Hey, I got him!

296
00:25:57,299 --> 00:25:58,954
Fuck, I missed it!

297
00:26:03,345 --> 00:26:04,345
Yeah!

298
00:26:31,175 --> 00:26:34,009
Shit! Damn near empty!

299
00:26:34,123 --> 00:26:35,360
I got this one.

300
00:26:36,246 --> 00:26:38,530
There's a lot of private planes
in farm country like this.

301
00:26:39,529 --> 00:26:41,870
I guess they all hit the pumps
and they took off.

302
00:26:41,871 --> 00:26:42,658
Yeah, to where?

303
00:26:43,171 --> 00:26:43,854
Got some here.

304
00:26:44,886 --> 00:26:46,186
- Can you handle that?
- Yeah, I got it.

305
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,894
I'm gonna see what's left
in the hangars.

306
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,719
Bunch of junk!

307
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:02,778
Steve?

308
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,972
Fran, Run!

309
00:28:19,142 --> 00:28:20,142
Run!

310
00:28:47,457 --> 00:28:48,457
Run!

311
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,320
Roger!

312
00:30:51,153 --> 00:30:53,743
It's all right...

313
00:30:53,845 --> 00:30:54,845
Peter!

314
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:58,247
Right... Fuck!

315
00:31:16,115 --> 00:31:18,353
You never aim a gun at anyone, Mr.

316
00:31:19,969 --> 00:31:21,735
Peter, my god!
What are you doin'?

317
00:31:21,736 --> 00:31:24,268
Scary... Isn't it?

318
00:31:29,327 --> 00:31:30,327
Isn't it?

319
00:31:32,676 --> 00:31:33,676
C'mon.

320
00:31:46,219 --> 00:31:49,822
We gotta find fuel.
Maybe closer to Cleveland.

321
00:31:49,823 --> 00:31:51,769
No, we've gotta stay
out of the big cities.

322
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:53,908
If it's anything like Philly we
might never get out alive.

323
00:31:53,909 --> 00:31:55,663
We might never get out
of any place alive.

324
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:58,976
- We didn't almost get out of there.
- We're gettin' outta here fine!

325
00:31:59,135 --> 00:32:01,726
As long as there's not too many of
those things we can handle 'em easy.

326
00:32:01,727 --> 00:32:04,345
It wasn't one of "those things"
that nearly blew me away.

327
00:32:05,101 --> 00:32:07,091
We gotta stay in the sticks.

328
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:10,663
There's bound to be more little
private airports upstate.

329
00:32:10,664 --> 00:32:12,468
There's the locks along the Allgheny.

330
00:32:12,687 --> 00:32:14,895
Fuel stations there.
State. Private.

331
00:32:14,896 --> 00:32:17,052
Those are probably still manned.
We don't need those hassles either.

332
00:32:17,053 --> 00:32:18,868
They're just out after
scavengers and looters.

333
00:32:18,869 --> 00:32:20,638
Oh, you got the papers
for this limousine?

334
00:32:20,639 --> 00:32:22,829
I got J.A.S id.
And so does Fran.

335
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:25,361
Right! And we're out here
doin' traffic reports.

336
00:32:25,362 --> 00:32:26,738
Wake up, sucker!

337
00:32:26,739 --> 00:32:30,133
We're thieves and we're bad guys!
That's exactly what we are.

338
00:32:31,027 --> 00:32:32,596
We gotta find our own way.

339
00:32:32,597 --> 00:32:34,423
Jesus Christ! We don't even
know where we going

340
00:32:34,424 --> 00:32:37,267
We don't have food. We don't have
water. We don't even have a radio.

341
00:32:39,351 --> 00:32:41,365
Stephen you need to
get some sleep.

342
00:32:53,287 --> 00:32:54,464
What the hell is it?

343
00:32:54,844 --> 00:32:58,768
Looks like a... shopping center.
One of those big indoor lots.

344
00:33:38,913 --> 00:33:39,913
Oh my God!

345
00:33:39,914 --> 00:33:41,311
No chance. Forget it.
Let's get out of here!

346
00:33:41,312 --> 00:33:42,874
Wait a minute. They can't
get up here.

347
00:33:42,874 --> 00:33:44,497
Yeah, I we can't
go down there!

348
00:33:44,497 --> 00:33:45,799
Let's check it out.

349
00:34:10,235 --> 00:34:13,522
Most of the gates are down.
I don't think they can get into the stores.

350
00:34:13,523 --> 00:34:15,587
I haven't seen any of then
up on the second floor.

351
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:18,988
The big departments stores
usually use both floors.

352
00:34:18,989 --> 00:34:20,065
If we can ge it up top...

353
00:34:20,732 --> 00:34:21,732
Ok.

354
00:34:36,653 --> 00:34:39,678
Guess the power's not off in
this area. Could be nuclear.

355
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:42,529
What are they doing?
Why do they come here?

356
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:43,786
Some kind of instinct.

357
00:34:43,787 --> 00:34:46,873
Memory... Of what they
used to do.

358
00:34:48,146 --> 00:34:49,998
This was an important
place in their lives.

359
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:53,210
Hey... Look at this!

360
00:34:56,812 --> 00:34:58,724
These don't go down to the mall.

361
00:34:59,901 --> 00:35:01,134
What the hell is this?

362
00:35:08,396 --> 00:35:09,115
How do we get down there?

363
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:51,374
Ok, c'mon Fran, let go.

364
00:35:51,375 --> 00:35:52,859
Well, it's done.

365
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:56,620
Looks like a free lunch.

366
00:36:00,286 --> 00:36:01,477
Spam!

367
00:36:01,478 --> 00:36:03,014
Do you bring a can opener?

368
00:36:03,392 --> 00:36:05,010
No, I guess I didn't.

369
00:36:05,011 --> 00:36:06,798
Then don't knock it.
It got it's own key.

370
00:36:11,657 --> 00:36:12,640
What do you think?

371
00:36:14,523 --> 00:36:16,023
This is the only way up here.
What do you think?

372
00:36:49,931 --> 00:36:51,491
You better get some sleep too, buddy.

373
00:36:55,211 --> 00:36:58,193
There's an awful lot of stuff
down there that we could use.

374
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:01,634
I know it.

375
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:06,699
Big place. But they're pretty
spread down there.

376
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:08,955
I think we can out-run 'em

377
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:10,508
Hit and run?

378
00:37:10,509 --> 00:37:11,800
Hit and run.

379
00:37:13,741 --> 00:37:14,897
Are you crazy?

380
00:37:14,898 --> 00:37:17,684
This place could be a gold mine.
We gotta a least check it out.

381
00:37:17,983 --> 00:37:20,913
This is exactly what we're
trying to go away from... Look what...

382
00:37:20,914 --> 00:37:21,914
Stephen!

383
00:37:21,915 --> 00:37:24,021
Leave him be.
We're going ourselves.

384
00:37:25,068 --> 00:37:26,634
That's ready to shoot. Be careful.

385
00:37:26,635 --> 00:37:28,548
The trigger squeezes really easy...

386
00:37:28,549 --> 00:37:32,172
but the weapon'll kick you good
when it fires. Be ready for that!

387
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:35,707
Anyone but us comes up the stairs,
you guys take off in the machine.

388
00:37:41,203 --> 00:37:45,361
You'll probably hear some shooting.
Just don't panic, ok?

389
00:38:12,663 --> 00:38:13,689
Here.

390
00:38:49,444 --> 00:38:50,445
Keys to the kingdom.

391
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:53,074
Grab the walkie talkies.

392
00:39:38,895 --> 00:39:41,094
It's Christmas time down there, buddy.

393
00:39:41,095 --> 00:39:43,610
Fat city, brother. How we gonna work it?

394
00:39:45,054 --> 00:39:49,440
We get into one of the stores up here.
They'll probably have their own escalators.

395
00:39:49,441 --> 00:39:51,010
Let's check those keys.

396
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:53,292
Fifteen upper and lower.

397
00:39:54,093 --> 00:39:55,369
Right here.

398
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:56,562
How about a little music?

399
00:39:57,076 --> 00:39:57,794
What?

400
00:39:58,157 --> 00:39:59,383
Might cover the noise we make.

401
00:40:04,622 --> 00:40:07,650
Hit 'em all. Might as well
have power in everything.

402
00:40:07,651 --> 00:40:08,753
We might need it.

403
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:38,836
Stephen?

404
00:40:39,231 --> 00:40:40,231
Stephen!

405
00:41:33,838 --> 00:41:35,904
What do you think?
Bag it or try for it?

406
00:41:35,905 --> 00:41:37,242
- You game?
- I need lighter fuel.

407
00:41:37,243 --> 00:41:38,773
You got it.

408
00:41:50,578 --> 00:41:54,261
Jesus Christ! They're maniacs!

409
00:41:54,933 --> 00:41:56,280
Wait...

410
00:42:10,947 --> 00:42:12,107
Alright!

411
00:42:14,975 --> 00:42:16,111
C'mon!

412
00:42:19,261 --> 00:42:20,714
Stephen, don't go down there!

413
00:42:20,868 --> 00:42:22,069
- Bastard!
- What happen?

414
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:23,271
Don't open!

415
00:42:25,094 --> 00:42:26,396
Not working!

416
00:42:45,128 --> 00:42:46,128
C'mon!

417
00:42:55,709 --> 00:42:57,499
Don't open the door! C'mon!

418
00:43:05,523 --> 00:43:07,262
Let her go!
Take care of the other one!

419
00:43:19,683 --> 00:43:20,659
Stephen, for God sake!

420
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:23,520
We can't leave those
guys down there.

421
00:43:23,698 --> 00:43:27,155
Well... We're in.
Now how the hell we're gonna get back?

422
00:43:27,156 --> 00:43:29,718
Who the hell cares?
Let's go shopping first!

423
00:43:31,604 --> 00:43:32,947
Watch it! Watch it!

424
00:43:32,948 --> 00:43:36,720
Just let's get the stuff we need!
I'm gonna get us a television and a radio!

425
00:43:36,721 --> 00:43:39,810
Ok, find the goods.
I got them! I got them!

426
00:43:39,811 --> 00:43:40,812
Ok.

427
00:43:43,806 --> 00:43:44,695
I'm gonna need
at least a couple!

428
00:43:44,696 --> 00:43:45,655
Why not?

429
00:44:10,253 --> 00:44:12,564
Hey man, we can't carry all that shit.

430
00:44:13,827 --> 00:44:15,856
Oh, I see. We're just
gonna wheel right by 'em.

431
00:44:15,857 --> 00:44:22,030
We gonna try brother. We ain't doin' this for
the exercise. We might try to get what we can.

432
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:57,204
Alright. Let's go brother!
The old okey doke!

433
00:45:00,377 --> 00:45:03,296
- Hey, Ugly!
- Let's raise some hell... Hey... Hey...!

434
00:45:04,113 --> 00:45:05,902
- Come here champ! Come here!
- Over here... Hey... Hey...!

435
00:45:07,662 --> 00:45:10,610
- C'mon, over here!
- Over here! That's right!

436
00:45:10,611 --> 00:45:12,482
C'mon, C'mon...
C'mon, C'mon...!

437
00:45:18,198 --> 00:45:19,415
Alright, c'mon!

438
00:45:20,533 --> 00:45:22,021
C'mon... Over here...

439
00:45:25,135 --> 00:45:28,209
Just give it time...
give it time.

440
00:45:50,248 --> 00:45:52,672
Ok. They're coming.

441
00:45:52,885 --> 00:45:57,147
Go on up. Stay outta sight but
lemme know when is clear enough.

442
00:45:57,148 --> 00:45:58,219
- Ok.
- Ok.

443
00:46:00,624 --> 00:46:05,164
Come to papa! That's it.
Keep coming... Keep coming.

444
00:46:13,572 --> 00:46:15,599
Peter, it's good. Let's do it.

445
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:16,708
Is it clear?

446
00:46:16,709 --> 00:46:19,191
Not altogether... But they
spread out pretty good.

447
00:46:19,192 --> 00:46:21,584
- I think we can move the wagon.
- I'm comin'

448
00:46:56,555 --> 00:46:58,722
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know... Fuzz maybe?

449
00:46:58,723 --> 00:47:00,725
Or maybe flyboy. Where's it comin' from?

450
00:47:00,726 --> 00:47:01,726
I don't know. I can't tell.

451
00:47:54,188 --> 00:47:54,712
C'mon. Open up.

452
00:47:55,856 --> 00:47:58,777
- Maybe I'd go with you.
- Open up so I can get the wagon over!

453
00:47:58,778 --> 00:48:01,674
- If it's flyboy, let's get him on our side.
- Ok.

454
00:48:05,231 --> 00:48:07,795
- You just cover me good. You hear?
- You got it!

455
00:49:21,807 --> 00:49:23,691
Hold it flyboy!

456
00:49:23,692 --> 00:49:25,233
Don't go into the stairway!

457
00:49:27,368 --> 00:49:30,746
Don't open that door, baby.
You'll lead 'em right up with you.

458
00:49:31,458 --> 00:49:33,102
Run for it. Run this way.

459
00:49:38,397 --> 00:49:43,819
That's it. C'mon! Run...
Run... Run... C'mon!

460
00:49:44,962 --> 00:49:48,357
Now... Head for the department store.
Go!

461
00:50:12,016 --> 00:50:14,560
Ok, downstairs again...
Same trick... Let's go!

462
00:51:33,905 --> 00:51:36,584
- What do we do?
- Let them know we're here.

463
00:51:36,585 --> 00:51:40,856
Whoooo Hoooo!
C'mon. Let's go... Over here!

464
00:51:41,965 --> 00:51:44,406
You did alright this time, flyboy.
How about it?

465
00:51:45,852 --> 00:51:49,147
- Whooooo peeeee!
- Over here.

466
00:52:05,681 --> 00:52:10,396
Now is the time to make
savers in our weekend sales department.

467
00:52:17,096 --> 00:52:18,601
Jesus Christ!

468
00:52:18,602 --> 00:52:23,103
...dinning room fest
with a 40 by 60 burlap table...

469
00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:34,078
Why pay more when
the sales are open right here!

470
00:52:35,081 --> 00:52:37,303
We just gotta wait longer before we move.

471
00:52:37,304 --> 00:52:40,275
There's always the chance of some
of 'em stayin' up on the balcony.

472
00:52:40,276 --> 00:52:42,260
We can handle that.
We can break through 'em.

473
00:52:42,261 --> 00:52:46,204
If any of 'em see or hear us. They'll
just follow us up. It's not good.

474
00:52:46,205 --> 00:52:49,819
We can sure outrun 'em. Load up
what we can and get the hell outta here.

475
00:52:50,776 --> 00:52:52,743
I've been thinking...

476
00:52:52,744 --> 00:52:54,608
Maybe we got a good thing going here...

477
00:52:54,609 --> 00:52:57,768
- Maybe we shouldn't be in such a hurry to leave.
- Oh, man!

478
00:52:57,769 --> 00:53:01,002
If we could get back up there
without them catchin' on...

479
00:53:01,003 --> 00:53:04,909
We could hold up for a while.
At least long enough to catch a breath.

480
00:53:04,910 --> 00:53:07,140
Check out the radio. See what's hapenin'

481
00:53:07,141 --> 00:53:09,900
- Oh, man!
- There's some kind of passageway
over the top of the stores.

482
00:53:11,537 --> 00:53:13,935
I don't know if it's just heating
ducts or some kind of access.

483
00:53:15,776 --> 00:53:17,130
I saw 'em on a map.

484
00:53:19,687 --> 00:53:22,571
Upstairs... Let's go!

485
00:53:30,847 --> 00:53:31,750
Ceiling is just lighting grids!

486
00:53:33,086 --> 00:53:35,076
Is gotta be in this area.

487
00:53:35,077 --> 00:53:36,280
It's on the map!

488
00:53:36,281 --> 00:53:37,507
Elevator shaft...

489
00:53:45,383 --> 00:53:46,381
Hold the doors!

490
00:53:56,253 --> 00:54:00,298
It's here. You gonna need a screwdriver
or somethin' to stand on for down there.

491
00:54:00,299 --> 00:54:02,480
I know where the tools are.
Why don't you grab the stool over there?

492
00:54:12,311 --> 00:54:16,451
It's alright. We can get it off.
You found it, flyboy.

493
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:22,901
One stop shopping. Anything you
need right at your fingertips.

494
00:54:23,063 --> 00:54:25,305
- Phillips?
- Here you go.

495
00:54:39,882 --> 00:54:41,035
Stephen?

496
00:54:51,367 --> 00:54:53,305
Shit!

497
00:55:03,052 --> 00:55:04,638
Jesus!

498
00:55:04,639 --> 00:55:06,317
I seen it. C'mon.

499
00:57:07,863 --> 00:57:10,390
Don't shoot! They'll hear it downstairs!

500
00:57:47,439 --> 00:57:49,186
Looks like we're gonna be ok.

501
00:57:55,408 --> 00:57:57,761
You should see all the great
stuff we got, Frannie.

502
00:57:57,762 --> 00:58:00,965
All kinds of stuff...
This place is terrific!

503
00:58:00,966 --> 00:58:06,283
It's really esay to pick the profit.
All kinds of things...

504
00:58:06,284 --> 00:58:08,732
We really got it made in here... Frannie!

505
00:58:10,313 --> 00:58:11,831
Frannie?

506
00:58:22,585 --> 00:58:24,161
What the hell time is it, anyway?

507
00:58:24,162 --> 00:58:25,787
Not quite nine.

508
00:58:25,788 --> 00:58:26,931
And nothing?

509
00:58:26,932 --> 00:58:29,589
As long as we're getting the pattern
that's means they're sending the signal.

510
00:58:41,637 --> 00:58:46,405
No longer seek ocupancy
in private residences...

511
00:58:46,406 --> 00:58:50,224
... no matter how safe or
well protected they may be.

512
00:58:52,830 --> 00:58:57,317
... the president today is
a the congress...

513
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:02,548
Is she alright?
She looks blunt.

514
00:59:02,549 --> 00:59:05,963
- What do you expect?
- I mean, she really looks sick.

515
00:59:06,356 --> 00:59:07,422
Phisically.

516
00:59:07,423 --> 00:59:08,301
She's pregnant.

517
00:59:09,019 --> 00:59:12,057
... the communications with
Detroit had been knocked out...

518
00:59:15,905 --> 00:59:16,706
How long?

519
00:59:16,707 --> 00:59:18,136
Three and half, maybe four months.

520
00:59:18,159 --> 00:59:19,651
Jesus!

521
00:59:20,657 --> 00:59:22,841
Steve, maybe we should
try to get movin'

522
00:59:22,842 --> 00:59:23,933
We can deal with it.

523
00:59:23,934 --> 00:59:25,859
Yeah, but maybe she needs a
doctor or somethin'

524
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:28,633
We can deal with it!
Doesn't change a thing.

525
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:31,930
Do you wanna get
rid of it?

526
00:59:33,061 --> 00:59:36,771
- Huh?
- Do you want to abort?

527
00:59:38,149 --> 00:59:41,611
It's not too late.
And I know how.

528
01:00:14,071 --> 01:00:16,779
How your decisitions were made?

529
01:00:19,082 --> 01:00:21,885
Do you want to abort it?

530
01:00:22,995 --> 01:00:24,375
Do you?

531
01:00:28,561 --> 01:00:30,546
Somebody better sit
watch all the time.

532
01:00:30,547 --> 01:00:32,101
They'll never get through there.

533
01:00:32,102 --> 01:00:36,435
Enough of 'em will. And ain't just
them things we got to worry about.

534
01:00:36,436 --> 01:00:41,401
That chopper up there could give us
away if somebody comes messin' around.

535
01:00:41,402 --> 01:00:43,839
What are gonna do?
Land another pilot to fly it out.

536
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:47,033
They're not gonna mess with a little bird
like that. They got enough in their hands.

537
01:00:48,056 --> 01:00:50,393
So, I guess we forget
about Canada, right?

538
01:00:53,287 --> 01:00:55,150
Nobody cares about my vote.

539
01:00:55,151 --> 01:00:57,609
Oh, c'mon, Frannie
don't you sleeping.

540
01:00:57,610 --> 01:01:02,861
You know... I'm afraid... You're
hypnotised by this place... All of you!

541
01:01:02,862 --> 01:01:06,815
It's all so bright and neatly wrapped
that you don't see is a prison too!

542
01:01:06,816 --> 01:01:10,412
Stephen, just let's take what we
need and keep going.

543
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:15,879
Do you know how many times do we have
to land for fuel on our way up north?

544
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:18,917
Those things out there are everywhere.

545
01:01:19,866 --> 01:01:23,427
The authorities will give us just a
hard time... Maybe worse!

546
01:01:25,696 --> 01:01:27,202
Fran...

547
01:01:31,917 --> 01:01:36,907
We've got everything
we need right here.

548
01:01:46,737 --> 01:01:48,097
Let's get some sleep.

549
01:01:49,134 --> 01:01:55,331
... on other side, these creatures
function on a subconstious instinctal level...

550
01:01:55,332 --> 01:01:58,886
You were the one that want to
set up a house.

551
01:02:00,207 --> 01:02:02,740
... develops a chemical spray
from crop dusting airplanes...

552
01:02:02,741 --> 01:02:05,614
... that doesn't have
effects on human population...

553
01:02:05,615 --> 01:02:08,669
... normal question.
The first question is always...

554
01:02:08,670 --> 01:02:11,871
... are these cannibals?
No, they're not cannibals...

555
01:02:11,872 --> 01:02:17,264
... Cannibalism in the true sense of
the word implies an intraspecie activity...

556
01:02:17,265 --> 01:02:20,490
... these creatures cannot
be consider human...

557
01:02:20,491 --> 01:02:24,365
... they prey on humans.
they do not prey on each other!...

558
01:02:24,366 --> 01:02:30,491
... that's the difference. They attack...
They feed only on warm human flesh...

559
01:02:31,525 --> 01:02:36,295
... Intelligence? Seemingly little
or no reasoning power...

560
01:02:36,296 --> 01:02:42,154
... What basic skills remain are more like
remembered behaviours from normal life...

561
01:02:43,363 --> 01:02:46,126
... There are reports of these
creatures using tools...

562
01:02:46,127 --> 01:02:48,311
... but even these actions
are the most primitive...

563
01:02:48,312 --> 01:02:52,054
... the use of external articles
as bludgeons and so forth...

564
01:02:52,055 --> 01:02:57,188
... I might point out that even animals could
adopt the basic use of tools in this manner...

565
01:02:57,877 --> 01:03:04,289
... These creatures are nothing but
pure motorised instinct...

566
01:03:04,290 --> 01:03:09,541
... We must not be lulled by the concept that
these are our family members or our friends...

567
01:03:09,542 --> 01:03:13,223
... They are not. They would
not respond to such emotions...

568
01:03:13,224 --> 01:03:18,269
... They must be destroy on sight!...

569
01:03:20,299 --> 01:03:24,753
That was Dr. Miller Rush
from the O.E.P...

570
01:03:24,754 --> 01:03:30,442
... and... later on... hopefully today
we're not exactly sure yet...

571
01:03:30,443 --> 01:03:32,981
... I'm waiting for word on this
from some people...

572
01:03:32,982 --> 01:03:38,093
... we expected get him here for a
liveshow. An actual live interview...

573
01:03:38,094 --> 01:03:39,094
... so we can discuss things with him...

574
01:03:40,214 --> 01:03:42,624
The semis are big enough
to block the entrances.

575
01:03:42,625 --> 01:03:43,945
You sure we can start 'em?

576
01:03:43,946 --> 01:03:45,461
You haven't spent enough
time on the street.

577
01:03:45,462 --> 01:03:48,460
This report says they're
working on an analysis...

578
01:03:48,461 --> 01:03:50,300
... of this whole phenomenom...

579
01:03:50,301 --> 01:03:54,905
... from the point of view of a virus disease.
They've been doing various lab tests...

580
01:03:54,906 --> 01:03:58,054
... to see if the can deal
with it in that way...

581
01:03:58,055 --> 01:04:01,653
... and perhaps come up with some
kind of a workeable vaccine...

582
01:04:03,189 --> 01:04:04,175
Hey Fran.

583
01:04:04,753 --> 01:04:06,643
Acording to this report,
the problem they run into Atlanta...

584
01:04:06,644 --> 01:04:09,155
... is that there not are
specimens available...

585
01:04:09,718 --> 01:04:11,872
... it seems in that area
there aren't intact...

586
01:04:13,626 --> 01:04:18,642
... We have a film report
shot in Atlanta but it's not arrived...

587
01:04:19,996 --> 01:04:23,845
I would have made you coffee and
breakfast, but I don't have my pots and pans.

588
01:04:25,647 --> 01:04:30,651
Also... Wait a minute...
There is another report...

589
01:04:30,864 --> 01:04:32,396
May I say something?

590
01:04:32,646 --> 01:04:33,824
Shoot

591
01:04:35,436 --> 01:04:39,412
I'm sorry you found out I'm pregnant, because I don't wanna be treat differently than you'd treat each other

592
01:04:39,413 --> 01:04:41,166
Hey, Frannie, c'mon!

593
01:04:41,167 --> 01:04:43,261
And I'm not gonna be den mother
for you guys

594
01:04:44,530 --> 01:04:46,144
And I want to know what's going on...

595
01:04:46,144 --> 01:04:50,062
...And I want something to say about the plans.
There's four of us, ok?

596
01:04:50,063 --> 01:04:51,353
Jesus, Fran...

597
01:04:51,467 --> 01:04:52,753
Fair enough!

598
01:04:52,754 --> 01:04:54,636
Ok. Now what's goin' on?

599
01:04:54,803 --> 01:04:58,285
We're goin' out.
And you're not coming with us!

600
01:04:58,286 --> 01:05:01,226
And you won't come with us until
you'll learn how to handle yourself

601
01:05:04,957 --> 01:05:05,839
Something else...

602
01:05:08,049 --> 01:05:10,996
I don't know about you two,
but I wanna learn how to fly that helicopter

603
01:05:13,882 --> 01:05:17,160
If anything happens to you,
we have to be able to fly out of here

604
01:05:18,449 --> 01:05:20,163
She's right, man

605
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:23,815
C'mon. Let's go.

606
01:05:26,479 --> 01:05:29,257
And I don't want to believe
you're leaving me without a gun again

607
01:05:41,707 --> 01:05:44,182
I just might be able to
figure how to use it

608
01:05:47,392 --> 01:05:48,972
I'm sorry, Stephen

609
01:05:49,978 --> 01:05:51,587
It's alright. It's alright

610
01:05:52,258 --> 01:05:53,155
Stephen?

611
01:05:56,412 --> 01:05:57,320
Yeah?

612
01:05:58,843 --> 01:06:00,454
Be careful

613
01:06:02,330 --> 01:06:03,717
Yeah, we'll be alright

614
01:06:07,918 --> 01:06:12,197
In spite of everything you hear here
there's still some people with a sense of humour

615
01:06:19,112 --> 01:06:20,747
How about it?

616
01:06:20,883 --> 01:06:21,962
Gettin' it

617
01:06:33,187 --> 01:06:35,582
I'm not too sure of this thing.
I'll just ride pick up

618
01:06:35,583 --> 01:06:37,536
I grew up on one of these.
C'mon, let's go!

619
01:06:37,537 --> 01:06:38,537
Alright!

620
01:07:11,845 --> 01:07:15,126
Hey, your tail is to slow too?
Come in.

621
01:07:15,824 --> 01:07:18,548
You look my size when you're
sitting in that truck

622
01:07:20,686 --> 01:07:24,115
Well, I wanna know is how if we've both
have the same force together...

623
01:07:24,116 --> 01:07:25,116
...yours be so enlarge?,
You know

624
01:07:25,117 --> 01:07:27,887
Well, they told me it was
a midget force...

625
01:07:27,888 --> 01:07:29,727
They needed somebody
to look out you

626
01:07:30,866 --> 01:07:33,024
Hey, where's flyboy?
What's his twenty?

627
01:07:33,330 --> 01:07:36,191
I just hope he'll fly
off that roof or we fly zero!

628
01:07:46,570 --> 01:07:48,035
Ok, let's go! C'mon!

629
01:08:26,916 --> 01:08:28,108
C'mon, Roger, Come on!

630
01:08:29,709 --> 01:08:31,169
C'mon, c'mon, man!

631
01:09:17,768 --> 01:09:21,195
- Like a charm, uh? A Fucking charm!
- C'mon, man. Three more, baby!

632
01:10:00,245 --> 01:10:01,160
Roger!

633
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:10,890
C'mon, look, man!

634
01:10:16,128 --> 01:10:17,128
Look!

635
01:11:19,328 --> 01:11:20,577
Get its head up...

636
01:11:21,726 --> 01:11:23,364
Get its head up!

637
01:11:25,687 --> 01:11:27,417
Roger, get its head up, man!

638
01:11:52,530 --> 01:11:55,770
Get down! Stay down... I got it!

639
01:11:56,886 --> 01:11:58,269
Roger, move!

640
01:12:09,233 --> 01:12:10,711
Bastards

641
01:12:12,711 --> 01:12:14,861
You bastards

642
01:12:15,791 --> 01:12:17,034
Roger?

643
01:12:17,881 --> 01:12:19,129
We got 'em, buddy. Didn't we?

644
01:12:24,912 --> 01:12:27,601
We got this, man.
We got this by the ass!

645
01:12:33,268 --> 01:12:34,359
Roger?!

646
01:12:34,603 --> 01:12:38,069
C'mon, man! Get your head together!
We got a lot to do!

647
01:12:38,159 --> 01:12:40,941
Let's go, baby. Number two...

648
01:12:42,896 --> 01:12:44,084
You alright?

649
01:12:44,982 --> 01:12:47,367
Perfect, baby. Perfect!

650
01:13:57,976 --> 01:13:59,554
Come on, here!

651
01:14:18,648 --> 01:14:20,298
Let finish this. C'mon man!

652
01:14:23,417 --> 01:14:25,289
Roger, c'mon. C'mon man!

653
01:14:39,511 --> 01:14:42,526
Leave him, motherfuckers! Son of bitches!

654
01:14:55,905 --> 01:14:58,365
- Oh, God! Oh, Jesus!
- What?

655
01:14:59,603 --> 01:15:02,099
My bag. I left my goddam bag
in the other truck!

656
01:15:06,554 --> 01:15:09,390
Alright. You better screw
your head on.

657
01:15:09,391 --> 01:15:11,326
Yeah! C'mon, c'mon!
Let's go!

658
01:15:11,327 --> 01:15:17,055
I mean it, man! Now you're not just
playin' with your life, your playin' with mine!

659
01:15:17,608 --> 01:15:19,570
Now are you straight?

660
01:15:24,884 --> 01:15:26,221
Yeah

661
01:15:48,165 --> 01:15:50,335
Go, go, go!

662
01:15:51,274 --> 01:15:53,365
C'mon, Roger, come on!

663
01:16:04,621 --> 01:16:05,973
Watch it, man!

664
01:16:06,870 --> 01:16:07,632
Watch out, watch out!

665
01:16:13,630 --> 01:16:17,452
Roger watch it!
Damm!

666
01:16:57,758 --> 01:16:59,384
That's it, man

667
01:17:02,983 --> 01:17:04,757
- That's it
- Bullshit!

668
01:17:04,758 --> 01:17:06,077
We gotta deal with that leg!

669
01:17:06,078 --> 01:17:08,597
I'm dealin' with it... I'm just dealin' with
it fine! Don't you worry, buddy!

670
01:17:11,998 --> 01:17:14,816
There's a lot to get done before
you can afford to lose me

671
01:17:26,212 --> 01:17:28,895
It all depends on how many of
them are still inside

672
01:17:28,896 --> 01:17:31,185
There's one hell of a run
we gotta make

673
01:17:31,186 --> 01:17:35,136
If we have more flares,
or maybe some of those propane jobs

674
01:17:35,137 --> 01:17:38,357
Guns are first.
Guns and ammunition

675
01:17:52,192 --> 01:17:53,786
You sure you gonna make it?

676
01:17:56,941 --> 01:17:58,440
Just hurry up with that!

677
01:18:50,933 --> 01:18:52,664
Don't try to shoot
through those gates

678
01:18:52,665 --> 01:18:56,913
Openings are too small. Bullet will
wind up chasin' us around in here

679
01:18:57,782 --> 01:18:59,495
Don't worry. They can't
get through

680
01:19:13,798 --> 01:19:16,027
- Ain't it a crime
- What?

681
01:19:16,028 --> 01:19:18,402
The only person who could
ever miss with gun...

682
01:19:18,403 --> 01:19:20,722
... is the sucker with the
bread to buy it.

683
01:19:25,554 --> 01:19:27,914
You just wait
out there, sissies...

684
01:19:27,915 --> 01:19:32,476
... we comin'
And we ready!

685
01:20:06,432 --> 01:20:08,232
OK, let's go!

686
01:20:37,415 --> 01:20:39,770
OK, the door is open.
Push, push!

687
01:20:39,771 --> 01:20:41,395
That's it! Push! That's it!

688
01:20:55,262 --> 01:20:57,765
We're inside. C'mon, let's go!

689
01:21:07,445 --> 01:21:08,528
Hardware

690
01:21:10,306 --> 01:21:11,690
Look here, man... I'm...

691
01:21:11,691 --> 01:21:13,466
I know, shut up. Will you

692
01:21:27,259 --> 01:21:30,293
Alright. The toughest part
will be gettin' by these right here

693
01:21:30,294 --> 01:21:31,613
It's too far

694
01:21:31,614 --> 01:21:33,729
There's no backing up now

695
01:21:33,764 --> 01:21:35,690
We gotta lock those main doors

696
01:21:35,691 --> 01:21:38,264
We'll never make all four entrances.
It's too risky

697
01:21:38,265 --> 01:21:41,337
We'll make it. You just
be ready to open up for us

698
01:21:43,006 --> 01:21:45,626
Wait a minute!
The car!

699
01:21:45,627 --> 01:21:46,165
What?

700
01:21:46,166 --> 01:21:49,464
One of those car? Why don't
you use the car over there?

701
01:21:54,371 --> 01:21:55,779
You OK to start it?

702
01:21:56,524 --> 01:21:57,524
OK, let's go

703
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:11,667
Close the door. Close the door!

704
01:22:15,055 --> 01:22:16,832
The keys, Stephen... The keys!

705
01:22:28,446 --> 01:22:30,194
C'mon, man.
Get out of there!

706
01:22:31,981 --> 01:22:33,145
God dammit!

707
01:22:33,146 --> 01:22:34,709
Keep 'em! Just keep 'em!

708
01:22:34,710 --> 01:22:36,673
Lock yourself in there!

709
01:23:45,562 --> 01:23:46,651
Jump in the back!

710
01:23:56,947 --> 01:23:58,766
- You alright?
- Yeah

711
01:24:25,173 --> 01:24:27,864
- Keep 'em at large and I'll do the lock
- Gotcha!

712
01:24:42,597 --> 01:24:46,330
That's not 100%, but I don't
think they'll get through

713
01:24:46,331 --> 01:24:47,846
Can't they smash the glass?

714
01:24:47,847 --> 01:24:50,437
Safety stuff.
Pretty indestructible

715
01:24:50,438 --> 01:24:52,655
They got no leverage under the truck

716
01:24:52,656 --> 01:24:55,187
I hopin' they'll just go away
after they find they can't get in

717
01:24:55,797 --> 01:24:58,419
I'll get the alarms.
You get in the car

718
01:25:14,628 --> 01:25:18,080
We're OK. We got it made.
It's gonna work

719
01:25:47,445 --> 01:25:49,148
How many you figure are already in?

720
01:25:49,149 --> 01:25:51,355
I don't know.
Not too many

721
01:25:51,356 --> 01:25:53,340
We'll get 'em easy

722
01:25:53,341 --> 01:25:57,400
We get it all locked off.
Then we're goin' on a hunt!

723
01:27:41,272 --> 01:27:43,034
We put up the wall here

724
01:27:43,035 --> 01:27:44,757
This way we can still
get to the plumbing

725
01:27:44,758 --> 01:27:46,851
Why can't we just
board up the stairway?

726
01:27:46,852 --> 01:27:49,902
Sooner or later, it might
be a patrol through here

727
01:27:49,903 --> 01:27:51,901
Looters maybe...

728
01:27:51,902 --> 01:27:55,257
I don't want anybody to
even know that stairway exists

729
01:28:24,029 --> 01:28:26,001
I don't know what else to do?

730
01:28:26,613 --> 01:28:28,297
You're doin' fine

731
01:28:29,444 --> 01:28:32,271
His leg is awful.
The infection is spreading quickly

732
01:28:33,237 --> 01:28:35,756
Can't we do somethin'?
Can't we take him to a Med Unit?

733
01:28:35,969 --> 01:28:40,690
I've seen half a dozen
guys get bitten by those things...

734
01:28:40,691 --> 01:28:44,701
None of 'em lasted more
than three days

735
01:28:48,017 --> 01:28:49,443
Peter where are you?

736
01:28:50,707 --> 01:28:52,166
Right here, trooper

737
01:28:54,509 --> 01:28:57,039
We did it, didn't we?

738
01:28:57,039 --> 01:28:58,716
We whip 'em, didn't we?

739
01:28:58,717 --> 01:29:00,690
That's right Rog

740
01:29:00,691 --> 01:29:05,252
Didn't we? Didn't we whip 'em?

741
01:29:05,253 --> 01:29:06,975
We sure did, buddy

742
01:29:06,976 --> 01:29:11,463
We whipped 'em.
We whipped 'em good.

743
01:29:11,464 --> 01:29:15,257
We whipped 'em!
We got it all!

744
01:29:58,399 --> 01:30:00,843
Leave me alone. It's alright
It's my problem

745
01:30:00,844 --> 01:30:04,345
Just get out of here.
I don't want you here!

746
01:30:08,020 --> 01:30:11,494
I just don't want you
to see me like this

747
01:30:12,771 --> 01:30:15,044
Stephen get out. Please!

748
01:30:28,885 --> 01:30:32,126
This place is gonna be rotten

749
01:30:33,453 --> 01:30:35,865
We gotta cleaning up, brother

750
01:31:49,622 --> 01:31:51,896
You never know

751
01:33:22,231 --> 01:33:23,587
What do you think?

752
01:33:26,528 --> 01:33:28,028
Watch this!

753
01:34:58,810 --> 01:35:00,693
They're still here

754
01:35:00,694 --> 01:35:04,445
They're after us.
They know we're still in here

755
01:35:04,446 --> 01:35:06,149
They're after the place...

756
01:35:06,150 --> 01:35:10,417
They don't know why.
They just remember

757
01:35:10,418 --> 01:35:12,740
Remember that they
wanna be in here

758
01:35:12,741 --> 01:35:14,527
What the hell are they?

759
01:35:14,528 --> 01:35:18,858
They're us, that's all.
There's no more room in Hell

760
01:35:19,824 --> 01:35:21,574
What?

761
01:35:21,575 --> 01:35:24,236
Sometin' my grandad
used to tell us

762
01:35:24,237 --> 01:35:28,826
You know Macumba?
Voodoo...

763
01:35:28,827 --> 01:35:34,371
Grandady was a priest in Trinidad.
Used to tell us...

764
01:35:34,372 --> 01:35:37,133
When there's no more
room in Hell...

765
01:35:37,134 --> 01:35:40,279
The dead will walk the Earth

766
01:35:53,094 --> 01:35:54,901
Got him! Hurry up! C'mon!

767
01:36:34,968 --> 01:36:38,666
Go on... I'll stay with him

768
01:37:01,251 --> 01:37:03,725
You'll take care of me,
wouldn't you, Peter?

769
01:37:06,332 --> 01:37:08,721
You'll take care of me...
when I go

770
01:37:08,722 --> 01:37:12,016
Try to get some sleep.
Save your strenght

771
01:37:14,926 --> 01:37:19,481
I don't wanna be walkin'
around like that

772
01:37:21,499 --> 01:37:23,445
Peter?

773
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:26,000
Peter?!!

774
01:37:26,001 --> 01:37:27,001
Yeah, I'm here man!

775
01:37:33,242 --> 01:37:37,138
Don't do it, til you're sure
I am comin' back

776
01:37:41,808 --> 01:37:46,723
I'm gonna try not to...

777
01:37:46,724 --> 01:37:51,627
I'm gonna try no to...
come back

778
01:37:51,628 --> 01:37:55,395
I'm gonna try...

779
01:37:57,528 --> 01:38:01,176
... not to.

780
01:38:01,177 --> 01:38:04,477
They use...
maybe...

781
01:38:04,478 --> 01:38:07,192
five percent of the food
available on the human body

782
01:38:07,193 --> 01:38:09,346
... the kind of things...

783
01:38:09,347 --> 01:38:13,988
...with that food amount, the body
is usually intact enough

784
01:38:13,989 --> 01:38:15,544
...to be mobile when it revives

785
01:38:15,545 --> 01:38:17,600
What are you saying?
I mean... You scientists...

786
01:38:17,601 --> 01:38:20,301
- Dummies, dummies!
- What are you suggesting?

787
01:38:20,302 --> 01:38:24,511
Excuse me.
Listen, quiet! Quiet!

788
01:38:25,417 --> 01:38:27,898
One wonders what
is worth saving...

789
01:38:27,899 --> 01:38:29,431
...which is I do

790
01:38:30,203 --> 01:38:32,916
For all I know...
The brain is already dead...

791
01:38:32,917 --> 01:38:34,779
...is the idiots who still alive

792
01:38:36,756 --> 01:38:38,935
Can I speak it up how
to stay alive too?

793
01:38:38,936 --> 01:38:41,537
And I'm tryin' to help
you gentlemen

794
01:38:41,538 --> 01:38:44,242
And you can help.
But what you do take...

795
01:38:44,243 --> 01:38:47,243
- In a logical way...!
- ...is illogical!

796
01:38:47,244 --> 01:38:49,160
Illogical hell!

797
01:38:49,161 --> 01:38:54,852
Illogical hell! I'm showing you a way
that we can opt...

798
01:38:54,853 --> 01:38:57,597
... to pull supplies twenty times!

799
01:38:59,669 --> 01:39:01,407
To pull supplies for whom?

800
01:39:01,408 --> 01:39:04,388
For a whole specimen that is
walking around there...

801
01:39:04,389 --> 01:39:07,303
- ... in increasing numbers.
- We should feed 'em?

802
01:39:07,304 --> 01:39:08,835
What else we
should with 'em?

803
01:39:08,836 --> 01:39:10,890
Gimme an alternative!

804
01:39:10,891 --> 01:39:13,577
I thought you
scientists can come up with that?

805
01:39:13,578 --> 01:39:19,261
... actually, that way solve the problem of growing.
Feeding the oposition doesn't make any sense!

806
01:39:19,262 --> 01:39:22,091
Well I can think on one alternative

807
01:39:22,092 --> 01:39:23,818
I can think on another one, yes.

808
01:39:23,819 --> 01:39:28,173
Since they seem to congregate
in heavily populated areas...

809
01:39:28,174 --> 01:39:31,510
and since we haven`t touch
upon our nuclear resources

810
01:39:31,511 --> 01:39:33,652
why don't we drop a bomb
in all the big cities?

811
01:39:33,653 --> 01:39:36,355
- You probably can't be serious?
- I'm deadly serious! What are the choices?

812
01:39:36,356 --> 01:39:41,210
- What if they run out of food?
- They don't run out of food. That's the problem!

813
01:39:41,211 --> 01:39:44,186
And they won't run out of
food while we still alive

814
01:39:44,187 --> 01:39:48,029
This kind of things, you know,
things that we're talking about here...

815
01:39:48,030 --> 01:39:51,816
...sounds like just a bunch of
people talking crazy

816
01:39:51,817 --> 01:39:54,218
- This is not figthing...!
- ... without actually picture it out!

817
01:39:54,219 --> 01:39:57,419
This is not the
republic against the democrats...

818
01:39:57,420 --> 01:40:01,838
...that got us in a hole economically.
Or lead us to another war!

819
01:40:01,839 --> 01:40:05,424
... is more crucial that we go
down to the line, folks

820
01:40:05,740 --> 01:40:12,080
...we're down to the line. There are
no divisions upon 'em and the living...

821
01:40:12,081 --> 01:40:16,475
At least... At
least let him finish, please!

822
01:40:17,491 --> 01:40:19,614
It`s really all over, isn't it?

823
01:40:19,615 --> 01:40:22,340
...unemotional!

824
01:40:23,933 --> 01:40:26,854
...we got to remain rational

825
01:40:26,855 --> 01:40:34,956
- Logical... logical
- Scientist always think in those kinda turns...

826
01:40:34,957 --> 01:40:38,480
...if it doesn't work that way
that's not how people really are

827
01:40:38,481 --> 01:40:42,511
You've got
to remain logical. We've got to.

828
01:40:42,512 --> 01:40:46,480
There's no choice.
It has to be.

829
01:40:46,481 --> 01:40:49,583
It's gonna be that!

830
01:41:21,397 --> 01:41:22,439
Here it comes!

831
01:41:25,865 --> 01:41:29,125
- Oh nice!
- Wow!

832
01:41:29,126 --> 01:41:33,327
- Bon apetit!
- thank you!

833
01:41:33,328 --> 01:41:38,601
- Stephen?
- Thank you very much!

834
01:41:41,936 --> 01:41:44,151
Peter, what about you?
Where you goin'?

835
01:41:44,152 --> 01:41:47,222
This is just for the two of you

836
01:41:53,362 --> 01:41:55,318
Enjoy

837
01:42:50,292 --> 01:42:52,548
We can't Stephen. Not now

838
01:42:54,852 --> 01:42:56,229
But we will...

839
01:44:26,394 --> 01:44:28,920
Hey, when you finish the rove,
we wrapped it up the drugstore

840
01:47:03,437 --> 01:47:05,721
Attention, all shoppers...

841
01:47:05,722 --> 01:47:11,981
...if you have a 32,
we have a special treat for you...

842
01:47:11,982 --> 01:47:15,705
...if you purchase is in the
next half and hour

843
01:47:15,706 --> 01:47:18,634
...with an amount of
five dollars or more

844
01:47:18,635 --> 01:47:24,519
...we'll give you a bar
of Hard Candy free!

845
01:48:27,238 --> 01:48:30,384
There hasn't been a broadcast
fro three days. Why don't you give it up?

846
01:48:32,560 --> 01:48:35,066
They might come back on

847
01:49:17,935 --> 01:49:21,578
What have we done
to ourselves?

848
01:49:50,226 --> 01:49:53,142
OK, now easy... easy

849
01:49:56,565 --> 01:49:58,512
Stabilise it. That's right!

850
01:50:00,691 --> 01:50:04,446
Bring 'er down. Down, down.

851
01:50:07,506 --> 01:50:10,899
That's it! You got it!

852
01:50:11,505 --> 01:50:15,707
- Hon, you got it!
- Yeah, I did it!

853
01:50:20,015 --> 01:50:22,586
- Wow!
- They must get in through the roof

854
01:50:22,587 --> 01:50:23,917
Son of a bitch!

855
01:50:23,918 --> 01:50:27,598
- They have trucks blockin' all the entrances
- Yeah, trucks!

856
01:50:27,599 --> 01:50:30,089
No sweat!

857
01:50:30,090 --> 01:50:31,935
What do you think?

858
01:50:31,936 --> 01:50:34,630
Hit 'em now or tonight?

859
01:50:35,531 --> 01:50:37,829
Tonight

860
01:50:42,982 --> 01:50:47,483
Hey, we know you in there?
seen the helicopter on the roof...

861
01:50:54,504 --> 01:50:57,757
... how many of you in there?

862
01:51:00,843 --> 01:51:03,253
We know you're up there.
We seen the whirlybird on the roof

863
01:51:03,254 --> 01:51:07,472
Hey you guys shut up.
Cut it! Shut up!

864
01:51:07,473 --> 01:51:08,735
Raiders

865
01:51:08,736 --> 01:51:13,105
Could ya use some company
up there?

866
01:51:16,577 --> 01:51:19,910
- They know we're here, maybe we should...
- No chance

867
01:51:19,911 --> 01:51:23,617
Oh, change your mind...
Do you wanna try?

868
01:51:23,618 --> 01:51:26,115
Alright, cut. Cut, cut!

869
01:51:26,116 --> 01:51:33,274
Listen... How many of you in
there, anyway... there's three of us

870
01:51:35,209 --> 01:51:37,157
- What if...
- Quiet!

871
01:51:37,158 --> 01:51:40,683
- I think we should...
- Jesus Christ! Shut up and listen

872
01:51:40,684 --> 01:51:46,547
We don't like people who don't share.
You just fucked up real bad!

873
01:51:50,400 --> 01:51:51,723
Let's go

874
01:52:23,868 --> 01:52:24,926
It's time.
Let's go

875
01:52:40,539 --> 01:52:44,230
Just three, huh?

876
01:52:44,739 --> 01:52:46,703
Holy shit!

877
01:52:51,059 --> 01:52:54,365
They'll get in. They'll
move the trucks

878
01:52:54,764 --> 01:52:56,610
There's hundreds of those
creatures down there

879
01:52:56,611 --> 01:52:59,088
C'mon man, that's a
professional army

880
01:52:59,089 --> 01:53:03,063
Looks like they been survivin'
on the road all through this thing

881
01:53:03,064 --> 01:53:08,984
Well let's not make
it esay for 'em. Come on!

882
01:53:14,823 --> 01:53:15,941
What's happening?

883
01:53:15,942 --> 01:53:18,519
There's fifteen or twenty of 'em.
We're gonna shut off the gates

884
01:53:18,520 --> 01:53:20,649
- Stephen
- We're just gonna shut the gates

885
01:53:20,650 --> 01:53:22,258
They'll never know
we're here

886
01:53:36,594 --> 01:53:39,505
Downstairs first.
Got your talk box?

887
01:53:39,506 --> 01:53:40,890
- Yeah
- Keep it handy

888
01:54:54,263 --> 01:54:59,253
Shit... It's all taped up.
It's all ready for us

889
01:54:59,254 --> 01:55:03,782
What the hell are they doing? There's a
whole fucking glass latch and won't open!

890
01:55:03,783 --> 01:55:06,599
Yeah, everyone fucking
thinks like, Joe

891
01:55:07,862 --> 01:55:11,392
Hey, the whole damm gate
locks won't open

892
01:55:11,393 --> 01:55:13,809
Let's go blow the
goddammed gate locks!

893
01:55:13,810 --> 01:55:15,461
Watch that guy with the machine gun,
you won't believe it!

894
01:55:17,371 --> 01:55:18,382
Wacht out, dude!

895
01:55:36,732 --> 01:55:39,325
They're in, flyboy.
They're opening the outer locks

896
01:55:54,321 --> 01:55:59,639
When those doors will open, there's
gonna be a thousand zombies in here

897
01:55:59,640 --> 01:56:03,848
They're gonna have their
hands full

898
01:56:21,401 --> 01:56:23,387
Just let 'em fire it up!

899
01:56:23,388 --> 01:56:25,672
Get up on the balcony.
Stay out of sight.

900
01:56:25,673 --> 01:56:28,940
I'll meet you...
at the Information room

901
01:56:51,320 --> 01:56:54,835
Alright guys, look out for yoursefls.
It's good for us. Let's go!

902
01:58:13,493 --> 01:58:14,910
Hey you there!

903
01:58:16,299 --> 01:58:17,698
Hello

904
01:58:33,763 --> 01:58:35,570
Flyboy?

905
01:58:36,831 --> 01:58:38,501
Flyboy?

906
01:58:38,880 --> 01:58:40,733
Flyboy, where the hell
are you?

907
01:58:58,853 --> 01:59:00,134
C'mon man, you're too slow!

908
01:59:08,738 --> 01:59:12,772
It's ours.
We took it

909
01:59:12,773 --> 01:59:14,768
It's ours.

910
01:59:29,931 --> 01:59:32,976
What the hell are you doing playin' around,
let's go upstairs and doin' him

911
01:59:34,017 --> 01:59:37,322
Goddamit Flyboy,
what the hell are you doing?

912
01:59:56,444 --> 01:59:57,688
Just stay out of sight!

913
01:59:57,689 --> 01:59:59,940
They're after the place,
they don't care about us!

914
02:00:08,630 --> 02:00:12,016
Alright, dammit!
Now we got a war!

915
02:00:22,808 --> 02:00:24,575
Say goodbye creep

916
02:02:12,576 --> 02:02:15,074
Where the hell are you
gonna watch that thing?

917
02:02:15,075 --> 02:02:16,388
You alright, man

918
02:02:37,994 --> 02:02:39,996
He's upstairs. Let's go!

919
02:02:55,467 --> 02:02:57,365
C'mon, mother...

920
02:03:04,717 --> 02:03:06,987
- Where he go?
- I don't know. Come on!

921
02:03:26,056 --> 02:03:27,995
I see you!

922
02:03:45,597 --> 02:03:48,617
Peter? Peter?!

923
02:03:54,327 --> 02:03:56,936
Peter!

924
02:04:28,183 --> 02:04:31,061
- I know he's in there!
- Come on!

925
02:04:32,485 --> 02:04:38,072
Hey you! I see you up there!

926
02:04:38,073 --> 02:04:40,614
C'mon, let's go!
Let's get out of here

927
02:05:09,054 --> 02:05:11,210
Son of a bitch!

928
02:05:14,196 --> 02:05:15,822
C'mon man. Let's get
the hell out of here

929
02:06:40,032 --> 02:06:42,643
Peter? Peter are you there?

930
02:06:42,644 --> 02:06:44,027
Where the hell are you?

931
02:06:44,028 --> 02:06:45,189
The elevator

932
02:06:45,190 --> 02:06:48,444
Those things are all over the place.
Climb up top...

933
02:06:48,445 --> 02:06:51,371
I'll get you out the
grid on the shaft

938
02:09:50,473 --> 02:09:57,388
We'll just wait...
We'll just wait a while

939
02:10:25,901 --> 02:10:28,012
It's almos light.
Let's go

940
02:10:29,779 --> 02:10:33,007
He doesn't aswer the
radio for hours

941
02:10:37,100 --> 02:10:39,200
For God sake!

942
02:12:46,002 --> 02:12:52,109

946
02:13:18,842 --> 02:13:22,548
- Oh, Jesus Christ, Peter...

947
02:13:25,306 --> 02:13:28,909
I really don't

948
02:14:00,608 --> 02:14:01,851

02:14:01,852 --> 02:14:05,774

950
02:17:08,236 --> 02:17:11,385
How much fuel do we have?

951
02:17:09,730 --> 02:17:13,282
Not much

952
02:17:15,500 --> 02:17:16,734
