<i>The Zenith Team.</i>

2
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:46,042
<i>Five young superheroes</i>
<i>who fought to protect the world from evil.</i>

3
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:05,660
<i>Led by Captain Zoom</i>
<i>and his brother Concussion,</i>

4
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,234
<i>the team saved many lives.</i>

5
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:13,472
<i>Team Zenith.</i>

6
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:19,603
<i>Oh, and with the help of their sidekick,</i>
<i>Dr. Grant.</i>

7
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,414
<i>The government sought to enhance</i>
<i>the team's powers</i>

8
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:25,610
<i>using Gamma-13 radiation.</i>

9
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:31,150
<i>Zoom got faster and stronger,</i>

10
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:36,052
<i>but the Gamma turned Concussion</i>
<i>to the dark side.</i>

11
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:39,458
<i>He turned on his own team.</i>

12
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:48,367
<i>Zoom lost his powers</i>

13
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:50,569
<i>and his brother.</i>

14
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:12,026
<i>We're coming up now.</i>
<i>Prepare to deactivate cloaking device.</i>

15
00:02:20,406 --> 00:02:24,172
I told you not to call me
unless the world was going to end.

16
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:25,835
I <i>don't</i> know about the world ending,

17
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:28,142
but we've been tracking
a pan-dimensional anomaly

18
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:31,012
that seems to be moving toward
our time-space continuum.

19
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:34,076
Dr. Grant, I speak Greek, not geek.

20
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:35,886
Let me put it this way.

21
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:38,549
Concussion is still alive,
and <i>he's</i> coming back.

22
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,217
He was destroyed.

23
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:44,291
- Nope.
- We were there. We both saw it.

24
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:46,554
Nope.

25
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:50,361
<i>Twelve days and counting.</i>

26
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:52,136
The time has come.

27
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,039
<i>I'm</i> reactivating the Zenith Program.

28
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:59,934
Find me some kids.
Misfits, outcasts, weirdos.

29
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,879
Give me that file.

30
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,717
<i>Zoom's</i> the only one who can train them.

31
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:09,015
Now, get to Long Beach,

32
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:12,546
find him, evaluate his condition,
and bring him back here.

33
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:17,624
You know he <i>won't</i> cooperate.

34
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:20,860
You won the Nobel Prize, Doctor.
You'll think of something.

35
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:58,769
<i>Okay, he's looking. Come now.</i>

36
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:03,638
<i>There's</i> a car coming, lady.

37
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:06,573
Hey, look out.

38
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,310
Yeah, you're sure you're okay, huh?

39
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:16,046
- That guy almost killed me.
- Watch out for the

40
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:17,180
grease.

41
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,422
Should have told you
about those grease spots.

42
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:22,051
Come on, get up.

43
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:24,518
Grant?

44
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:26,856
- Hello, Zoom.
- <i>It's</i> Jack.

45
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:30,158
Okay, Jack.

46
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:32,861
<i>It's</i> good to see you.

47
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:35,003
Wow. You got old.

48
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:39,902
<i>It's</i> been, what, 30 years?

49
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:43,537
- What are you doing here, Grant?
- We're starting up a new team.

50
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,479
<i>Men's</i> slow-pitch softball?

51
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:50,116
No, a new Zenith team.

52
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:53,652
- You <i>can't</i> be serious.
- We are serious, Mr. Shepard.

53
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:56,422
- Why is the green dress talking?
- <i>I'm</i> a psychologist.

54
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:59,124
<i>I'm</i> sorry. This is Miss Holloway.
She works with me.

55
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:00,995
Yes, and despite the theatrics,

56
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:03,228
which were not my idea, by the way,

57
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,369
you're the only one who can help us.

58
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:07,429
You're the only superhero left.

59
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:10,836
<i>Somebody's</i> been giving you
the wrong information.

60
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,071
So, if you'll excuse me, I got work to do.

61
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,512
We're here to take you back,
not to invite you back.

62
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:18,550
And we're authorized to use
whatever means necessary.

63
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:21,083
- Grant, Grant, Grant.
- You <i>can't</i> shoot him.

64
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:24,247
- Nice.
- Sorry.

65
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:36,565
Trick or treat.

66
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:38,560
Here you go, sweetie.

67
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:42,238
Trick or treat.

68
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:49,174
- Thank you.
- Thanks a lot.

69
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:51,409
- Give it here, Howdy Doo-Doo.
- Bully.

70
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:02,954
Oh, my gosh.

71
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:07,225
Thank you.

72
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,569
I'll take that.

73
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:15,106
<i>She's</i> so weird.

74
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:17,034
Freak.

75
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,371
That was a good one.

76
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,961
Oh, my gosh.

77
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:40,599
What just happened?

78
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,258
How does my hair look?

79
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,336
Dylan.

80
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:57,245
Perhaps <i>you'd</i> like to come up
and finish <i>Newton's</i> equation?

81
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:00,175
I think Newton can finish his own equation.

82
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:02,981
Now, Dylan.

83
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:54,569
Yes.

84
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:11,986
Check it out.
<i>Lard-butt's</i> going to snap the board in half.

85
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:48,259
Wake up, Zoom.

86
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:51,763
Zoom? Welcome back to Area 52.

87
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,835
Thank you, Grant, for bringing me
back to a place

88
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:58,871
I've been avoiding for the last 30 years.

89
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,438
You have two choices as I understand it.

90
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:03,742
One is to stay here

91
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:06,300
and the other is to go directly to prison.

92
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:07,946
How long in prison?

93
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:11,606
We are also very happy to pay you $500,000.

94
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:16,921
You know you could've just said that
instead of shooting me with a dart.

95
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:19,915
Yes.

96
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,219
Mr. Shepard.

97
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:25,325
Mr. Shepard, I <i>can't</i> tell you how happy I am
that you've come aboard.

98
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,729
<i>It's</i> you.

99
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:31,431
Do you have an inner-ear problem
or something?

100
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:32,835
- Zoom...
- Jack.

101
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,365
Right, Jack.

102
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,308
Miss Holloway is our leading researcher
in the area of latent superhuman abilities.

103
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:40,538
She'll be in charge of
training the new Zenith team.

104
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:42,638
<i>She's</i> also quite a fan of yours.

105
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:47,047
I have every issue of
<i>Captain Zoom And His Amazing Team,</i>

106
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:49,417
most of them
still in their original plastic sleeves.

107
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:51,479
<i>That's</i> creepy.
But do you still have that green dress?

108
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:53,821
I even have the
fifth anniversary double issue,

109
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:55,588
<i>Zoom Vs. The Atomic Melt.</i>

110
00:09:55,661 --> 00:10:00,530
I have it in Japanese, German,
Farsi, Hindi and Braille.

111
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,325
How about that green dress? Still have that?

112
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:12,271
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention, please?

113
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:14,279
The return of Zoom.

114
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:21,483
Show of hands, who here does not live
with their mom in her basement?

115
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:30,927
We have assembled a group
of 10 special candidates.

116
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:33,691
The extent of their abilities is still unknown,

117
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:35,529
like it was when your team arrived.

118
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:37,899
We wanted your help
in choosing the ones with the best potential

119
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,062
for a new Zenith team.

120
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,572
Well, for half a million dollars
in cash and prizes

121
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,166
<i>let's</i> take a look at those contestants,
shall we?

122
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:56,184
What, are we forming a spelling bee?

123
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:58,655
I assure you, they are all quite gifted.

124
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:00,692
Gifted what? They're a bunch of kids.

125
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,854
And what power do they have? I <i>haven't</i>
read or heard about a Gamma event.

126
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:04,918
Well, there <i>weren't</i> any.

127
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:07,295
My studies in meta-human
psychophysiology

128
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:09,231
have made Gamma treatments obsolete.

129
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:12,065
I am quite confident
that we can develop their abilities

130
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:14,902
far beyond what was achieved
during the Gamma-13 days.

131
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:16,874
And we can do it safely

132
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:18,638
and naturally.

133
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:21,947
<i>I'm</i> sorry, I must've dozed off there
for a minute.

134
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,743
Times have changed, Zoom.

135
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:28,815
Well, <i>they'd</i> better be able to do
some mind-blowing stuff.

136
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:39,056
What is this? <i>She's</i> blinking fast.

137
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:42,291
- She was better in the audition.
- I am a little cooler.

138
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,729
Oh, dude.

139
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:56,114
Now you see him, now you don't.

140
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:57,711
How you doing?

141
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:14,195
Pass the hand sanitizer, please.

142
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:22,233
A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-l-J-K-L-M-N-O-P...

143
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:23,639
Stop that.

144
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:27,073
You're singing the alphabet.
<i>That's</i> not a power.

145
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:29,114
And your voice is average, <i>it's</i> not super.

146
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:30,705
It is, too, super.

147
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:43,187
Get another table in here, please.
Right away.

148
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:55,268
I see things.

149
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:57,101
Do you see dead people?

150
00:12:57,276 --> 00:13:00,609
I see that you suffer
from a massive inferiority complex.

151
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:03,648
I try to hide that so well.

152
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:08,820
<i>I'm</i> Jupiter the Gas Giant.

153
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:12,986
- Say, "Excuse <i>me."</i>
- Yikes.

154
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:21,565
Is he doing it,
or is he just naturally that chubby?

155
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,481
<i>It's</i> so cool.

156
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:02,734
Miss Holloway,

157
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:05,436
how would you like to introduce
our trainees to their new instructor?

158
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,308
I would love to. You ready?

159
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,538
- Yeah. I <i>can't</i> wait.
- Okay.

160
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:16,350
That is getting so old.

161
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:19,289
Well, considering you can read my mind,
I <i>don't</i> have many options.

162
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,826
I <i>can't</i> read your mind. I just feel stuff.

163
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:24,752
And you could stop hitting on me entirely.

164
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:27,228
No, I <i>can't</i> do that.

165
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:29,559
You and I are destiny.

166
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:35,529
Children, I would like to formally
introduce you to a very great man,

167
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:37,173
Mr. Jack Shepard.

168
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:44,142
Sorry. I <i>don't</i> remember eating that.

169
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:47,484
Great man or washed-up loser?

170
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:51,786
<i>It's</i> a fine line. What a nice kid.

171
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:55,452
Is the long hair and the James Dean angst
just a package with you?

172
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:58,860
Mr. Shepard is uniquely qualified
to be your new instructor.

173
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,389
And now he'll tell you why.

174
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,163
What?

175
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:04,735
Oh, yeah, kids,

176
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,598
do you have any idea
what you're doing here or why?

177
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:08,901
Me.

178
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:12,543
Come on. Come on. Me, me, me.

179
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:17,173
Me.

180
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:20,275
- All right, the little one.
- We were brought here in super secret

181
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:23,253
because we were selected
out of a huge group of kids

182
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:24,619
because we're really special

183
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,523
and they needed special kids
for a special course.

184
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:29,784
<i>That's</i> what Miss Holloway said.

185
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:34,232
I <i>don't</i> think I've ever heard anybody
use that many "specials" in a sentence.

186
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:38,202
She actually worked it in there
one more time than Collins did.

187
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:40,998
But <i>it's</i> all a lie.
We're here because we're different.

188
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:42,802
- We're not different.
- Come on. Chill out.

189
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,400
You can pick up a car, and you're six.
How different does it get?

190
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:47,877
- <i>Don't</i> tell her that.
- <i>Don't</i> be a jerk, man.

191
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,643
- What? Tucker, <i>I'm</i> not being a jerk.
- Children.

192
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,546
- Sorry.
- Okay, maybe this'll help.

193
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:59,953
I spent a lot of time here at Camp Secret

194
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:03,756
when I was just about your age.
And you know what?

195
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:05,420
It pretty much

196
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:07,429
- ruined my life.
- Mr. Shepard.

197
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:10,593
Hey, the military would like you to be
just like me.

198
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:13,103
You have to work hard and focus.

199
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:15,400
But most of all, most important,

200
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:19,137
you're going to need
massive doses of Gamma-13 emissions.

201
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:23,008
So <i>let's</i> wheel in that big machine
and zap the little guys, huh?

202
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:26,813
- <i>That's</i> not true. Mr. Shepard. Hallway.
- Right. <i>Let's</i> go to the hallway.

203
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:31,151
You guys want to slip into that lead
underwear, you wanna protect your privates.

204
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:33,957
Always the smart aleck.

205
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,753
But he is definitely the target, sir.

206
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:40,625
The center of the dimensional probing
is following Zoom here, from Long Beach.

207
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:44,066
We've finally found something
that Shepard excels at.

208
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:46,060
Being the bait.

209
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,196
If you <i>can't</i> get those kids
combat-ready in time,

210
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:53,472
I'll have to dose them with enough
Gamma-13 to sterilize a trailer park.

211
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,807
And if that should happen,
you can rest assured, sir,

212
00:16:56,882 --> 00:17:01,114
that I will do everything in my power
to make sure <i>it's</i> not my fault.

213
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:05,613
I told you.
We will not be dosing the children.

214
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:09,684
Based on what we have in there, I think
you might want to dose them just a little.

215
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:13,129
Come on. Drop them by a nuclear facility
and leave them there.

216
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,996
Or drop them off at the dentist and
have them x-rayed 200 or 300 times.

217
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:17,899
I <i>don't</i> think you understand
their sensitive condition.

218
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,801
What about my sensitive condition?

219
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,807
<i>I'm</i> being asked
to betray children for money.

220
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,136
- Are you done?
- I left a little pause there

221
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:30,010
in case you wanted to slip and fall again.

222
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:36,587
Grant, what am I doing here?

223
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:39,180
- Come on.
- Let me show you something.

224
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:44,388
Wow.

225
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,821
I made that suit for you.

226
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:51,100
Too bad you never got a chance to wear it.

227
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:54,936
- Welcome back, Zoom.
- <i>It's</i> Jack.

228
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:56,838
<i>It's</i> Zoom.

229
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,135
Wow.

230
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:02,040
<i>Where'd</i> you put... Is this...

231
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:10,015
Cool. Zoom comics.

232
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,421
Tucker, wait. Do not touch this.

233
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:16,286
This is a first edition.
<i>Don't</i> even touch the sleeve.

234
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:20,593
Now, everyone, please put on your
pH-balancing, antibacterial gloves.

235
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:25,497
Or not.

236
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:27,362
Why are you giving us these?

237
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,066
Well, <i>I'm</i> not giving them to you,

238
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:30,836
but <i>I'm</i> showing them to you

239
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:34,709
because yesterday you asked me
why Mr. Shepard was a great man.

240
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,872
Well,

241
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:38,172
this is why <i>he's</i> a great man.

242
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,480
Because he collects comic books?

243
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:43,885
No. Because he is the comic book.

244
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:47,117
Mr. Shepard is Captain Zoom.

245
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:50,188
And these comics are a record

246
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:54,962
of the incredible things that Zoom and
his amazing team did to protect mankind.

247
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:57,402
He was the leader of the Zenith team

248
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:01,303
faster than Quicksilver, the Flash
and Superman all together.

249
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,834
No way.

250
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:04,733
Way.

251
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:08,274
Zoom.

252
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:09,746
You're Captain Zoom.

253
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:12,909
- Can you eat fast, too?
- Zoom. Do something fast.

254
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,681
Well, I guess the <i>cat's</i> out of the bag, huh?

255
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:17,688
You <i>don't</i> look like a superhero.

256
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:20,247
I don't? Are you sure?

257
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,295
You know why?

258
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,328
Because <i>I'm</i> not a superhero.

259
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:28,195
<i>There's</i> no such thing as superheroes.

260
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:32,203
No matter what people told you around here,
you're not superheroes.

261
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:34,136
We're superheroes?

262
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,939
Awesome.

263
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:37,967
Yes.

264
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:40,841
You're definitely white kids, I'll tell you that.

265
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:46,576
- Yeah. What?
- Do we get names? And costumes?

266
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:50,710
- <i>I'm</i> sorry, <i>what's</i> your name again?
- Cindy Collins, age six.

267
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:53,815
Cindy Collins, age six. This <i>isn't</i> a parade.

268
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:57,251
Or a Girl Scout jamboree or some sleepover.

269
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:58,887
<i>It's</i> a military installation.

270
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:01,489
You get military stuff. Functional ware.

271
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:05,128
You see this? I used to be able
to move my entire body that fast.

272
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,338
So they put me
in a polycarbonate silicone suit.

273
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:09,931
That way I <i>didn't</i> vibrate out of my clothes.

274
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:11,805
You've got to stop doing that.

275
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:14,277
Can my superhero costume be a tutu?

276
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:15,745
Are you even trying to listen to me?

277
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:17,042
So what are they going to make us do?

278
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:20,050
I <i>don't</i> know, dude.
Let me think about that for just a minute.

279
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:22,746
And you're supposed to be training us.

280
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:27,088
Give me a break.
You can barely tie your shoes.

281
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:30,452
Come on, <i>let's</i> let Mr. Zoom
finish his oatmeal.

282
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:33,688
<i>It's</i> Cream of Wheat, dude.

283
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:39,170
<i>It's</i> remarkable. 2.5 tons per arm.

284
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:42,798
Wow, you shaved.

285
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:45,003
Wow, you noticed.

286
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:49,247
Would you believe that little girl
is holding 5 tons above her head?

287
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:51,680
- Look at that.
- Wait.

288
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,944
<i>Cindy, what are you wearing?</i>

289
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:54,645
<i>It's</i> my alter eggo.

290
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,982
<i>You mean your "alter ego"?</i>

291
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:57,646
<i>I'm</i> a princess.

292
00:20:57,889 --> 00:21:01,120
- Cindy, you're not a princess.
- But I look pretty.

293
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:04,660
Yeah, but pretty girls <i>don't</i> have any
real friends and they never get any respect.

294
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,595
Take Miss Holloway, for instance.

295
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:07,723
<i>Hey.</i>

296
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,003
Scatter.

297
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:18,610
Nice toss, Cindy. Really good.

298
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:22,113
Why <i>don't</i> you get a juice box
and a Rice Krispy treat?

299
00:21:48,206 --> 00:21:51,198
<i>It's</i> unbelievable.
<i>It's</i> as if <i>he's</i> not even there.

300
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:54,439
- Because <i>he's</i> not there.
- <i>He's</i> escaped again.

301
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,877
<i>Security, Code Dylan.</i>

302
00:21:57,449 --> 00:21:59,781
<i>I repeat, Code Dylan. Thank you.</i>

303
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:04,378
- I <i>don't</i> know why he does that.
- Because he <i>doesn't</i> like it here, Grant.

304
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:06,549
<i>Don't</i> know why not. <i>It's</i> good food.

305
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:10,026
Dr. Grant.
Tucker <i>won't</i> come out of the bullpen.

306
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:14,491
<i>It's</i> okay, Tucker.

307
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:17,330
I know you <i>don't</i> have any control
over this thing yet,

308
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:18,960
but can you please try to expand?

309
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:21,130
- I am trying, all right?
- You're wasting your time.

310
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:24,937
- Jack, you are undermining his confidence.
- What confidence?

311
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,676
<i>He's</i> a lazy little chubba bubba.

312
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:38,818
Hey, Marsha.
Exactly what part of him is this?

313
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:41,252
Help.

314
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:46,326
Hey there. Those kids
<i>aren't</i> going to be ready for anything.

315
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:48,764
Unless, of course,
you put Tucker in a vat of paint.

316
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:51,701
He swells up, you could do a room
in a couple of seconds. Other than that...

317
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:54,705
Well, maybe if you trained them at all...

318
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:58,507
Look, you know, it just might help
if I knew what I was training them for.

319
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:00,977
<i>I'm</i> sorry. I <i>don't</i> have time right now.
<i>I'm</i> late for a meeting.

320
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,513
Look out.

321
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:05,946
Oh, man... Hey, are you all right?

322
00:23:06,017 --> 00:23:08,008
- Yes.
- That was some fall.

323
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:12,452
You know, you're a nice woman.
But this whole program is a mistake.

324
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:16,390
The last thing the world needs is
a bunch of kids running around in costumes

325
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:18,725
thinking that they're heroes.

326
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:23,527
Sorry.

327
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,969
What happened to you?

328
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:29,302
What happened to the Sacred Oath?

329
00:23:29,374 --> 00:23:30,671
Issue number one.

330
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:35,145
<i>"Faster than fast. Truer than true.
In the pursuit of justice

331
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:38,546
- "there is no speed <i>limit."</i>
- There is no speed limit.

332
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:40,482
Yeah. Are you bipolar?

333
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,318
<i>It's</i> a comic book.

334
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:44,912
<i>It's</i> government propaganda.
They made it up.

335
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:47,356
- <i>I'm</i> sorry. <i>Who's</i> talking?
- To cover up.

336
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:51,121
It <i>wasn't</i> true.
<i>It's</i> not... None of that stuff is true.

337
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,629
It was true to me.

338
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:04,133
The brain scans do not correlate
with the <i>children's</i> test results.

339
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:07,110
They are subconsciously suppressing
their full abilities.

340
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:11,275
We face an imminent threat.
These kids have got to be ready now.

341
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:15,546
Sir, it might help
if I knew what the imminent threat was.

342
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:19,016
Sorry <i>I'm</i> late. I <i>didn't</i> get the memo.

343
00:24:20,058 --> 00:24:24,085
You know? But I heard the word
<i>"imminent threat."</i> What exactly...

344
00:24:24,162 --> 00:24:27,529
Hold it, Shepard. We're holding a meeting
for people who matter,

345
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:29,260
and Miss Holloway.

346
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:30,459
Well,

347
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:34,765
I think maybe a big bowl of prunes
might turn that frown upside down, General.

348
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:38,901
Guards, take him where the losers are
plotting another failure. He knows the way.

349
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:42,413
- Go to see your family, huh?
- Get him out of here now.

350
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:46,549
<i>Five days and counting.</i>

351
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:25,088
Scatter.

352
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:31,824
Holloway.

353
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:34,930
You mind telling me what was going on
between you and Larraby?

354
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,592
Jack, <i>it's</i> late.

355
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:40,104
I <i>can't</i> help those kids
unless I know <i>what's</i> going on.

356
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:47,005
You know, when they started talking
about bringing you in...

357
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:48,943
- Yeah?
...I was ecstatic.

358
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:53,742
Finally I would meet the only real superhero
left in the world.

359
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:55,809
Would you let that
superhero stuff go, please?

360
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:58,981
A hero who would fight for justice
at all costs.

361
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:02,918
I was a really Ionely,

362
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:05,452
kind of weird child.

363
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:07,493
Well, at least you know
you've grown out of that.

364
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:11,002
And the only comfort I found
was in reading about you.

365
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,130
<i>That's</i> because you're out of your mind.

366
00:26:14,205 --> 00:26:17,038
You gotta stop with this comic book stuff.

367
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:22,038
You know, the first thing you said to me
was that you're not a real superhero.

368
00:26:22,113 --> 00:26:24,638
- Right.
- Well, I <i>didn't</i> believe you then.

369
00:26:24,716 --> 00:26:27,810
But congratulations,
because you have convinced me.

370
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:29,820
You are nothing but a bitter man

371
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:33,824
happily getting paid to take your
resentments out on these children.

372
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:35,382
<i>It's</i> horrible.

373
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:41,889
All right, then.

374
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:45,765
We'll do this again.

375
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:50,397
Hey, that was a good meeting
last night, Grant.

376
00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:52,500
Yeah, it was cool.
It was just a simple staff meeting.

377
00:26:52,577 --> 00:26:54,101
<i>That's</i> what I thought, simple staff meeting,

378
00:26:54,212 --> 00:26:55,736
based on the way
I was shuffled out of there.

379
00:26:55,847 --> 00:26:57,041
So where we going?

380
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:58,514
We've got combat training tomorrow.

381
00:26:58,683 --> 00:27:01,743
We've got to get you into
some protective gear.

382
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:12,528
I <i>don't</i> want to hold your hand, thanks.
I <i>don't</i> want to hold your hand.

383
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:15,727
Let go of my hand.

384
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:18,701
<i>That's</i> quite painful.

385
00:27:19,537 --> 00:27:23,268
All right. I'll hold your hand. Careful.
And <i>what'd</i> I tell you about costumes?

386
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:26,174
<i>It's</i> not a costume. <i>It's</i> my perfective gear.

387
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:28,337
Yeah? <i>How's</i> a ballerina costume
going to protect you?

388
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:31,348
Are you crazy?
Who wants to hurt a ballerina?

389
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:34,682
Other ballerinas, Baryshnikov.

390
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:41,623
Wait a minute. No way.

391
00:27:42,427 --> 00:27:44,418
Is that you, Mr. Pibb?

392
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:46,291
You recognize me?

393
00:27:46,364 --> 00:27:48,423
How you doing, buddy? Give me five.

394
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,762
Mr. Pibb?

395
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:51,893
Yeah, <i>that's</i> the name we gave him.

396
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:54,461
We <i>didn't</i> have many friends down here,
so they built us one.

397
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:57,202
<i>He'd</i> go get you candy and sodas,
that sort of thing.

398
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:59,039
You were nice to him.

399
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:02,646
Do you have to touch things to,
like, understand them?

400
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:05,411
- Not always.
- <i>What's</i> he thinking about now?

401
00:28:05,483 --> 00:28:08,145
He thinks you've had an increase in mass.

402
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:09,948
Mr. Pibb.

403
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:13,184
<i>It's</i> impossible to know
what he thinks, Miss Jones.

404
00:28:13,258 --> 00:28:16,284
His program
is a rudimentary 15-megabyte system.

405
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,658
He has no thoughts.

406
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:20,289
I suppose you <i>don't</i> have thoughts
of what your life would be like

407
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,492
if you were a figure skater?

408
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:32,902
Well, then. I guess I'll leave you kids
in the capable hands of Jack Shepard.

409
00:28:33,244 --> 00:28:36,077
You do that, Grant. I'll take care of them.

410
00:28:36,614 --> 00:28:40,072
Mr. Pibb, is that old Rambler
still down in the hangar?

411
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:43,053
<i>Got the keys?</i>

412
00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:46,550
All right, come on, guys. Watch your heads.

413
00:28:46,624 --> 00:28:49,252
Come on, this way. Get over here.
Go over there.

414
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:52,455
All right, Pibb.
Knock off the security cameras.

415
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:55,129
Open the door.

416
00:28:56,267 --> 00:28:57,996
<i>Let's</i> go. Go, go, go.

417
00:28:59,971 --> 00:29:02,599
All right, stand right there. Ready?

418
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:08,577
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

419
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:17,052
<i>It's</i> the flying saucer from Area 51. It exists.

420
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:18,589
Look at that.

421
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:20,015
Wow.

422
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:23,151
We rebuilt it as best we could
after it crash-landed in the late '40s.

423
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:24,991
<i>It's</i> really awesome.

424
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:26,859
Yeah, <i>it's</i> amazing.

425
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:29,832
Yeah. <i>It's</i> really cool.

426
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:35,229
And is this <i>what's</i> going to take us
to all of our superhero gigs?

427
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,833
<i>I'm</i> getting goose bumps.

428
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:47,781
Got to stabilize this thing.

429
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:49,717
- Can I try?
- You want to drive?

430
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:50,948
Yeah, definitely.

431
00:29:51,022 --> 00:29:53,320
All right, just sit down there.

432
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:57,885
And you want to get your hands in that
green and blue slime.

433
00:29:57,962 --> 00:29:59,293
Right.

434
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:02,399
- Little gross in there, <i>isn't</i> it?
- Nasty, yeah.

435
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:03,900
Oh, boy.

436
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:07,266
- <i>Let's</i> make this thing rock.
- Yeah, how do you make it go faster?

437
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:11,206
Faster?
Therein lies the problem, guys, of the FE-12.

438
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,273
We never really figured this thing out.

439
00:30:13,344 --> 00:30:15,642
It only goes 20 miles an hour.

440
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:23,551
Maybe <i>there's</i> less to figure out
than there is to understand.

441
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:29,917
Hey, barbeque, to go.

442
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:34,760
Tucker, put the cow back.

443
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:35,822
But <i>I'm</i> hungry.

444
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,367
- Tucker.
- All right.

445
00:30:45,043 --> 00:30:46,670
Hey, hey, hey. Watch the...

446
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:49,612
...light pole.

447
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:54,477
<i>Hello. Welcome to Wendy's.</i>
<i>May I take your order, please?</i>

448
00:30:54,552 --> 00:30:56,520
- Classic Triple, lettuce, tomato.
- Get me one.

449
00:30:56,588 --> 00:30:59,648
Classic Triple, lettuce, tomato... I got it.

450
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:01,349
Classic...

451
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:04,088
- Can you see? Can you see this?
- No, <i>it's</i> all green and blurry.

452
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:05,925
- Extra fries.
- Hold on a second.

453
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:12,265
<i>I'm</i> going to have a...
What kind of toys do you have?

454
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:16,205
Chicken. Spicy Chicken Sandwich.
The other <i>order's</i> Crispy Nuggets.

455
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:18,265
- Is that it?
- Six Frosties.

456
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:20,004
Six Frosties. Chocolate.

457
00:31:20,078 --> 00:31:23,070
All right.
Now, <i>what's</i> everyone else drinking?

458
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:47,899
<i>We come in peace.</i>

459
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,540
Take me with you.

<i>a lot of people have seen</i>
<i>some type of flying saucer.</i>

462
00:32:02,553 --> 00:32:05,215
<i>I'm here with David right now,</i>
<i>who actually works at Wendy's.</i>

463
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:06,552
<i>David, can you tell us what you saw?</i>

464
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:10,185
<i>I saw the flying saucer. I saw it land.</i>
<i>I saw it make this noise that it made.</i>

465
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,195
<i>It went...</i>

466
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:14,231
<i>as it wobbled, and then...</i>

467
00:32:14,832 --> 00:32:16,959
<i>That's it. That's the way they sounded.</i>

468
00:32:17,035 --> 00:32:19,629
<i>- That's the way it was.</i>
<i>- And you actually saw the aliens? I mean...</i>

469
00:32:19,704 --> 00:32:22,901
<i>Well, it's not that...</i>
<i>The alien in the spaceship ordered from me.</i>

470
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:26,740
<i>You know, I don't know.</i>
<i>Maybe the spaceship runs on ice cream.</i>

471
00:32:26,844 --> 00:32:28,038
<i>That's my theory.</i>

472
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:31,047
<i>Because he ordered</i>
<i>a whole bunch of Frosties.</i>

473
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,080
Oh, no.

474
00:32:40,391 --> 00:32:42,188
Just go back and act like nothing happened.

475
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,922
We had a great day. <i>Let's</i> just
leave it at that. All right, you guys?

476
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:47,294
If I were you, Dylan, <i>I'd</i> disappear.
Hey, Marsha.

477
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:49,765
Mr. Shepard. How dare you?

478
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:54,697
- Do you even know what you've done?
- Yeah. I got you a hot chicken sandwich.

479
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:56,763
No, thank you.

480
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:58,233
Are you a vegetarian?

481
00:32:58,409 --> 00:33:01,901
You're supposed to be training these kids
for their first simulation.

482
00:33:01,946 --> 00:33:05,040
And instead, you're out gallivanting
in a stolen spaceship.

483
00:33:05,116 --> 00:33:06,845
Was I gallivanting?

484
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:10,685
Looks like the <i>saucer's</i> not the only
thing stuck in the '50s.

485
00:33:10,755 --> 00:33:12,484
You're probably 50.

486
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:25,769
<i>I'm</i> not a vegetarian.

487
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:29,469
<i>It's</i> a life choice. Nothing wrong with it.

488
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:54,729
Cindy.

489
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,824
Let go of my face, please.

490
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,737
What are you doing in here?

491
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:04,468
I had a bad dream.

492
00:34:07,011 --> 00:34:08,103
Well,

493
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:12,211
<i>I'm</i> sorry you had a bad dream.

494
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:16,183
<i>That's</i> easy to do here, I guess.

495
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:17,679
You...

496
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:25,821
- <i>Let's</i> walk you back to your room.
- Can I sleep here?

497
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:28,798
- Just for tonight?
- No, <i>that's</i> not a real good idea.

498
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:35,731
You <i>don't</i> want to stay here. I snore.

499
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:37,702
<i>I'm</i> quite gassy.

500
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:39,140
<i>I'm</i> scared.

501
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:42,913
Hello? Little help here?

502
00:34:47,985 --> 00:34:49,612
You want to stay on the couch?

503
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:51,314
Thanks, Mr. Zoom.

504
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:56,025
Can you let the light in?

505
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,186
Yeah.

506
00:34:57,862 --> 00:34:59,853
I'll leave the door open.

507
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:03,489
Because why would we want it dark
while we're sleeping?

508
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:09,566
Good night, Cindy.

509
00:35:13,911 --> 00:35:15,242
Mr. Zoom?

510
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:16,803
Cindy, please.

511
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:18,705
Am I different?

512
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:22,711
Yeah.

513
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:25,181
You know, but in a good way.

514
00:35:25,756 --> 00:35:26,848
I feel too different.

515
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:29,222
Yeah, <i>I'm</i> sure you do,
because you're wearing a rabbit outfit.

516
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:30,692
You gotta go to sleep, Cindy.

517
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:33,491
Is that why Mommy and Daddy
sent me here?

518
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:45,569
Listen.

519
00:35:46,577 --> 00:35:48,636
You were right the first day.

520
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:50,374
You're special.

521
00:35:50,448 --> 00:35:52,882
<i>There's</i> nobody in the world
that can do what you do.

522
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:54,611
Your parents, who love you very much,

523
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:58,416
they sent you here
so <i>you'd</i> learn how to use your difference

524
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:01,982
to help people.

525
00:36:06,964 --> 00:36:08,226
Good night.

526
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:34,722
Good night.

527
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:37,453
That was bolted to the wall.

528
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:50,567
<i>Welcome to our fully operational,</i>
<i>multi-platform J-1000 mission simulator.</i>

529
00:36:51,008 --> 00:36:54,205
<i>It is imperative</i>
<i>that you learn to avoid enemy fire.</i>

530
00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:55,610
A bit more advanced than in your day, eh?

531
00:36:55,646 --> 00:36:57,841
Yeah, in my day
we just had that British guy named Ben

532
00:36:58,015 --> 00:36:59,414
who threw sticks at us.

533
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:00,883
So what are the holes for?

534
00:37:00,952 --> 00:37:03,785
<i>It's</i> funny you should ask that.
<i>That's</i> the first question people ask.

535
00:37:03,854 --> 00:37:06,414
Our technician is Dick. Dick?

536
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,955
The holes are for firing the paintballs.

537
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,692
All right. <i>I'm</i> out of here.

538
00:37:12,763 --> 00:37:15,391
Oh, great. Another Code Dylan.

539
00:37:15,466 --> 00:37:17,559
He must like that isolation room.

540
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:20,331
<i>We'll have to proceed without Mr. West.</i>

541
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:25,633
The objective is to get the kids
to 70% combat capacity.

542
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:30,112
<i>I'm</i> going to start them off easily,
about 10%. What do you think? 10%?

543
00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:32,240
Yeah, yeah. That sounds great.

544
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:33,874
Dick, 10.

545
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:44,222
Children, your goal is to stop the simulator
by pressing that red button in the center.

546
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:46,263
How hard can that be?

547
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:47,991
I <i>don't</i> know.

548
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:01,978
Are you working on attraction or repulsion?

549
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:03,206
Watch.

550
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:06,780
Ready?

551
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,087
That would be attraction.

552
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:21,664
Oh, <i>I'm</i> sorry. I didn't...

553
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:23,627
Meanie.

554
00:38:23,934 --> 00:38:25,128
Oh, no.

555
00:38:51,595 --> 00:38:53,654
- Watch out.
- Look out.

556
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,134
<i>I'm</i> getting...

557
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:06,910
I want a name.

558
00:39:06,977 --> 00:39:09,377
Ten more, <i>that's</i> your name.

559
00:39:15,553 --> 00:39:17,111
Get me a name.

560
00:39:17,254 --> 00:39:20,155
Hey. How about nine more?
<i>There's</i> your name.

561
00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:47,016
Excuse me, Dr. Grant.

562
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,781
Sorry, Dr. Grant.

563
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:52,322
Why the rush, kids?

564
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:00,887
Watch out.

565
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:12,401
You see, it all works together
in a double helix.

566
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:14,945
So if you can manage to...

567
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:20,612
I've got a thing. If you could get the
double helix going, I'll be right back.

568
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:24,255
Think double helix.

569
00:40:25,656 --> 00:40:28,489
- That was ridiculous.
- That was really bad.

570
00:40:28,959 --> 00:40:30,756
I thought it was fun.

571
00:40:35,065 --> 00:40:38,057
Hey, guys. I shook down
our robot buddy, Mr. Pibb,

572
00:40:38,135 --> 00:40:39,864
and I got you some snacks.

573
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:42,030
I got mine already. Thanks.

574
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:46,271
You guys look like modern art.

575
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:50,546
Come on.
<i>How'd</i> you guys think the training went?

576
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:54,175
- Oh, please. Like you care.
- Hey. Chill out a little bit.

577
00:40:54,652 --> 00:40:57,177
<i>I'm</i> not the one that dropped you off
here at the military base, you know.

578
00:40:57,254 --> 00:41:01,315
No, you <i>didn't</i> drop us off here,
but you were supposed to teach us.

579
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:06,055
Thanks for all the training, Captain.

580
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:08,596
- You <i>don't</i> care about us.
- <i>She's</i> right.

581
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:13,303
I got hit with so many paintballs,
I've got more bruises than skin.

582
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:15,099
- Mr. Shepard?
- What?

583
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,501
You care about us,

584
00:41:18,008 --> 00:41:19,168
right?

585
00:41:21,846 --> 00:41:23,370
I brought cake.

586
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:27,113
<i>Don't</i> be fooled, Cindy.
He only cares about himself.

587
00:41:27,918 --> 00:41:29,613
Come here. <i>Let's</i> go get you cleaned up.

588
00:41:29,687 --> 00:41:31,279
Wait. Hey, look.

589
00:41:38,062 --> 00:41:39,154
Cake.

590
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,809
Smells like old socks in here.

591
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:54,435
Is he in there?

592
00:41:59,216 --> 00:42:01,582
Sucks being in here, <i>doesn't</i> it?

593
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:03,717
You know, Larraby actually knitted this.

594
00:42:03,787 --> 00:42:07,279
He and Grant, buck naked by a fire,
knit one, purl two.

595
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:10,594
They knitted this to contain people like us.

596
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:13,763
I got out of here three times.

597
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:16,698
And I'll bet Cindy could get out of here
whenever she wanted to.

598
00:42:16,767 --> 00:42:20,134
When I was her age, I used to just have
one leg work faster than the other.

599
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:21,967
I did this kind of fast hopping thing.

600
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,700
So you could skip?

601
00:42:23,774 --> 00:42:25,708
Hop. <i>Let's</i> go with hop.

602
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:29,108
One day, a bunch of my buddies
wanted to go down to the creek,

603
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:32,012
you know, to throw fish at each other,
paint our face. Guy stuff, you know.

604
00:42:32,082 --> 00:42:35,142
I wanted to go there so bad
that I concentrated

605
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:38,620
- and I just began to do my little...
- Skipping thing.

606
00:42:38,923 --> 00:42:40,185
Hopping.

607
00:42:41,025 --> 00:42:44,222
All of a sudden, man, I was there.
Boy, they noticed that.

608
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:46,320
And then other people noticed.

609
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:49,900
People like the Zenith Program,
they noticed.

610
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:53,965
So they dragged me and my...
They dragged me and my older brother...

611
00:42:54,038 --> 00:42:57,974
- I <i>didn't</i> know you had a brother.
- They dragged me here, and Grant,

612
00:42:58,042 --> 00:43:01,443
<i>I think he's had enough. Let him out.</i>
<i>Come on, Dylan.</i>

613
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:05,742
<i>This is Control.</i>

614
00:43:05,816 --> 00:43:08,182
This is Mr. Grant. You can release Dr. West.

615
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:11,244
<i>I'm</i> sorry. This is Dr. West.
Could you release Mr. Grant?

616
00:43:11,322 --> 00:43:13,415
<i>- Okay, you want us to release...</i>
- No, <i>don't</i> release Dr. Grant.

617
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:15,958
- Release Mr. West.
<i>- Wait, you want us... You just said...</i>

618
00:43:16,026 --> 00:43:18,290
- Just do what I say.
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

619
00:43:23,667 --> 00:43:25,897
<i>Two days and counting.</i>

620
00:43:31,508 --> 00:43:34,341
<i>I'm</i> pretty sure the ice <i>cream's</i> this way.

621
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:40,750
<i>"Outdoor Survival Simulator"?</i>

622
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,784
Sweet.

623
00:43:52,863 --> 00:43:54,694
This room is so cool.

624
00:43:57,901 --> 00:44:00,267
<i>What's</i> Dr. Grant doing in there?

625
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:01,730
Look.

626
00:44:02,506 --> 00:44:04,064
Close the door.

627
00:44:09,279 --> 00:44:10,405
Kids.

628
00:44:10,681 --> 00:44:13,582
Very good. <i>That's</i> great. <i>It's</i> closing up.

629
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:14,879
<i>Keep it open just a...</i>

630
00:44:14,952 --> 00:44:17,716
<i>It's</i> going... Oh, no, <i>it's</i> go... No, no.

631
00:44:18,422 --> 00:44:19,684
It closed.

632
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:22,920
<i>Good job.</i>
<i>Shouldn't you be in bed? Seriously.</i>

633
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:25,194
<i>Are you waiting for Peter Pan?</i>

634
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:27,595
<i>I'm</i> just kidding around. Tucker.

635
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:31,260
<i>Could you back off the control panel</i>
<i>a little bit? There are buttons on there</i>

636
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,098
I really <i>don't</i> want you to push,

637
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:34,535
<i>because...</i>

638
00:44:42,613 --> 00:44:45,446
I told you not to...
Why <i>didn't</i> you listen to me?

639
00:44:45,783 --> 00:44:46,977
<i>Okay, that's it.</i>

640
00:44:47,051 --> 00:44:51,351
Summer, I want you to open that door.
I want the rain to stop right away,

641
00:44:51,555 --> 00:44:52,647
<i>please.</i>

642
00:44:52,723 --> 00:44:54,554
You're making me very angry, children.

643
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:56,752
<i>This is not funny. This is not...</i>

644
00:45:03,934 --> 00:45:05,561
<i>What's</i> he doing?

645
00:45:05,936 --> 00:45:08,404
Press another button. Do not push button.

646
00:45:09,473 --> 00:45:11,065
I told you, no button.

647
00:45:12,276 --> 00:45:13,538
If you...

648
00:45:21,852 --> 00:45:23,217
<i>No more buttons.</i>

649
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:45,875
Do it, Cindy.

650
00:46:14,404 --> 00:46:16,429
Oh, nasty. Come on.

651
00:46:26,817 --> 00:46:30,344
It is the emotional core that is missing
in these <i>children's</i> lives.

652
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:33,116
<i>... that magnetizes so you can't move.</i>

653
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:36,023
<i>Put your head against these little diodes</i>
<i>and they give you</i>

654
00:46:36,093 --> 00:46:39,460
<i>13 times the lethal dose</i>

655
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:41,793
<i>of Gamma radiation.</i>

656
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:44,031
<i>And that made you more powerful?</i>

657
00:46:44,101 --> 00:46:45,932
Dylan, they're not going to put you in here.

658
00:46:46,003 --> 00:46:47,732
<i>That's</i> why <i>I'm</i> here.

659
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:50,365
To encourage your talents naturally.

660
00:46:51,708 --> 00:46:56,111
Dylan, <i>I'm</i> talking to you. Where do you go
when you fuzz out like that?

661
00:46:56,847 --> 00:46:57,836
I...

662
00:46:58,415 --> 00:47:01,976
You <i>don't</i> perchance get a little headache
over your eye when you do that, do you?

663
00:47:02,052 --> 00:47:03,212
Maybe.

664
00:47:03,287 --> 00:47:04,549
Maybe?

665
00:47:05,122 --> 00:47:06,316
Maybe.

666
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:09,015
Dylan, I got an idea.

667
00:47:09,259 --> 00:47:13,320
<i>I want you to think about Summer right now.</i>
<i>Stand here and see if you can find her.</i>

668
00:47:13,397 --> 00:47:15,490
<i>- But she's nowhere near here.</i>
<i>- I understand that.</i>

669
00:47:15,566 --> 00:47:19,832
Trust your instincts. Go down this hallway
in your mind and find her.

670
00:47:37,888 --> 00:47:39,515
<i>I'm</i> in her room.

671
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:41,352
No, I...

672
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,860
I can see her dancing.

673
00:47:48,465 --> 00:47:52,561
This is unbelievable. This is a real gift.
<i>It's</i> called mind-sight.

674
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:54,396
Look,

675
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:59,308
these kids are going to need a leader.
This team needs one.

676
00:47:59,576 --> 00:48:02,409
And a leader is someone
who can see the way.

677
00:48:02,446 --> 00:48:04,414
I think that may be you.

678
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:10,579
<i>And which one of the old team</i>
<i>had the mind-sight thing like me?</i>

679
00:48:10,654 --> 00:48:12,849
<i>- Oh, Marksman.</i>
<i>- Marksman.</i>

680
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:16,818
What happened to him?
And your girlfriend, Ace?

681
00:48:17,127 --> 00:48:20,688
They all lost their lives doing what they do,
being heroes.

682
00:48:20,764 --> 00:48:23,028
- Like in the comic book.
- Yeah.

683
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:27,435
So this killer, Concussion...
I thought that was all made up.

684
00:48:27,504 --> 00:48:29,438
Some of it was made up.

685
00:48:29,873 --> 00:48:34,071
So this maniac wiped out the whole team?

686
00:48:34,444 --> 00:48:37,811
It really <i>wasn't</i> his fault.
I mean, they made him into that.

687
00:48:37,881 --> 00:48:39,906
He was part of the team?

688
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:42,711
- Yeah.
- And you trusted him.

689
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:44,280
He was your friend, and he...

690
00:48:44,354 --> 00:48:47,448
You <i>don't</i> know what
you're talking about, okay?

691
00:48:48,792 --> 00:48:50,953
Concussion was your brother.

692
00:48:54,564 --> 00:48:56,361
His name was Connor.

693
00:50:05,869 --> 00:50:08,303
Summer, <i>what's</i> with the necklace?

694
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:13,670
It was the last thing my parents gave me
before they left.

695
00:50:13,877 --> 00:50:16,607
I guess they <i>couldn't</i> handle my powers.

696
00:50:19,783 --> 00:50:21,011
Can I...

697
00:50:35,665 --> 00:50:38,634
<i>I'm</i> sorry, Miss Holloway.
We <i>couldn't</i> find him anywhere.

698
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:40,329
Okay. Thank you.

699
00:50:43,173 --> 00:50:47,473
All right. Well, we'll just have
to proceed without Mr. Shepard today.

700
00:50:48,078 --> 00:50:50,069
If everyone will open up their books...

701
00:50:50,147 --> 00:50:52,911
Hey, sorry <i>I'm</i> late,
but I had to get my gang together.

702
00:50:52,983 --> 00:50:56,749
Make the measurements, guys.
<i>Don't</i> be afraid to tickle them.

703
00:50:59,623 --> 00:51:02,148
It almost looks like you're glad to see me.

704
00:51:03,126 --> 00:51:08,063
No, no, <i>I'm</i> not... <i>I'm</i> not glad to see you.
I mean, the children are glad to see you.

705
00:51:08,665 --> 00:51:12,863
And, well, I guess if they're glad to see you,
then <i>I'm</i> glad to see you. I <i>don't</i> know.

706
00:51:12,936 --> 00:51:14,460
Okay. <i>I'm</i> glad.

707
00:51:14,538 --> 00:51:16,028
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

708
00:51:16,106 --> 00:51:18,472
Well, anyway, kids,
this is what we're going to do.

709
00:51:18,542 --> 00:51:20,271
We're gonna continue
your physical training,

710
00:51:20,343 --> 00:51:22,277
along with your teamwork exercises,

711
00:51:22,345 --> 00:51:25,371
but to complement your internal strengths.

712
00:51:26,483 --> 00:51:29,043
- When do we get names?
- We'll deal with that, but right now,

713
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:31,053
most importantly,
I want to deal with the fundamentals,

714
00:51:31,121 --> 00:51:34,181
and <i>there's</i> two fundamentals,
control and execution.

715
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:36,817
Think about it. Control and execution.

716
00:51:36,893 --> 00:51:38,656
Come on, guys. Follow me.

717
00:51:44,501 --> 00:51:46,799
One. Two. Three.

718
00:51:57,848 --> 00:51:58,974
Pull.

719
00:52:01,318 --> 00:52:02,842
You all right?

720
00:52:02,919 --> 00:52:05,683
<i>He's</i> invented a super fabric for Tucker.

721
00:52:06,356 --> 00:52:08,119
Congratulations, Ed.

722
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:16,591
Yeah.

723
00:52:18,835 --> 00:52:23,499
The coolest, strongest, best time
you ever attracted or repelled something

724
00:52:23,573 --> 00:52:26,041
because whenever that was, it was just...

725
00:52:29,412 --> 00:52:30,743
Nailed it.

726
00:52:40,957 --> 00:52:42,185
Thanks.

727
00:52:54,237 --> 00:52:55,829
- I got it.
- Yes.

728
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:03,668
Yeah!

729
00:53:04,981 --> 00:53:06,744
Yeah, man. Nice job.

730
00:53:09,786 --> 00:53:11,549
Well, how are they?

731
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:14,555
They're enjoying their victory.

732
00:53:15,225 --> 00:53:17,591
- <i>It's</i> been quite a week for them.
- Yeah.

733
00:53:18,128 --> 00:53:20,460
Why the sudden change of heart?

734
00:53:22,666 --> 00:53:25,499
They're becoming a real team, those kids.

735
00:53:25,902 --> 00:53:30,339
And I <i>didn't</i> realize what an incredible team
I had until they were gone.

736
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:34,010
And <i>I'd</i> like them
to avoid that same mistake.

737
00:53:35,111 --> 00:53:36,203
Nuts?

738
00:53:36,613 --> 00:53:38,274
No. <i>It's</i> beautiful.

739
00:53:38,348 --> 00:53:40,509
No, I mean do you like nuts?

740
00:53:41,585 --> 00:53:43,018
Yes, please.

741
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:45,411
- There you go.
- Thank you.

742
00:53:45,789 --> 00:53:48,815
I think if <i>we'd</i> had someone
who cared about us

743
00:53:49,292 --> 00:53:52,090
and taught us to succeed as a family,

744
00:53:52,295 --> 00:53:57,198
things would've been different for Connor,
and certainly for the rest of the team.

745
00:53:57,767 --> 00:53:59,166
Somebody...

746
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:02,432
Somebody like you.

747
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:10,276
I <i>ain't</i> cleaning that up.

748
00:54:11,481 --> 00:54:14,917
<i>Our only hope lies</i>
<i>with Marsha and Zoom training the kids.</i>

749
00:54:14,985 --> 00:54:17,180
<i>You can't be considering Gamma radiation</i>

750
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:19,586
<i>after what happened to Zoom's brother?</i>

751
00:54:19,656 --> 00:54:22,750
<i>Concussion becoming evil</i>
<i>was a horrible result.</i>

752
00:54:26,162 --> 00:54:29,029
<i>He's coming for Zoom</i>
<i>sooner than I thought.</i>

753
00:54:29,899 --> 00:54:32,197
And this is where he'll emerge.

754
00:54:32,469 --> 00:54:36,735
These will allow you to see
the dimensional rift we've been tracking.

755
00:54:39,509 --> 00:54:41,977
<i>He's</i> more powerful than I thought.

756
00:54:42,512 --> 00:54:45,948
You better have a plan
that works this time, birdbrain.

757
00:54:46,016 --> 00:54:48,007
Well, the kids will have to distract him

758
00:54:48,084 --> 00:54:51,053
so that we can launch
the sonic net I've designed.

759
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:53,055
The net will capture him in such a way

760
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:55,853
that it causes him
to concuss back on himself.

761
00:54:55,892 --> 00:54:59,328
- Is that our only option?
- Well, if Zoom still had his powers,

762
00:54:59,496 --> 00:55:01,361
his speed could create a mega vortex

763
00:55:01,398 --> 00:55:05,357
which would trap Concussion and reverse
the dark effects of the Gamma radiation.

764
00:55:05,435 --> 00:55:07,266
How much time have we got?

765
00:55:08,104 --> 00:55:10,129
Forty-eight hours. Tops.

766
00:55:19,115 --> 00:55:20,605
Anybody home?

767
00:55:20,684 --> 00:55:21,946
- Hi.
- Hey.

768
00:55:22,252 --> 00:55:24,686
- Nothing to wear?
- <i>How'd</i> you guess?

769
00:55:25,789 --> 00:55:28,656
Come here. Maybe I have something for you.

770
00:55:32,462 --> 00:55:35,488
There it is. I knew it was in here somewhere.

771
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:37,557
Wow.

772
00:55:38,301 --> 00:55:39,393
Pretty.

773
00:55:43,773 --> 00:55:45,297
<i>That's</i> perfect.

774
00:55:45,375 --> 00:55:47,343
- Are you sure?
- Oh, yeah.

775
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:50,777
<i>It's</i> just one of many purchased
for dates that never happened.

776
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:53,748
Turned out to be Ionely nights
reading my comic books.

777
00:55:53,817 --> 00:55:55,944
In between the crying fits.

778
00:55:57,253 --> 00:55:59,414
It all started with my prom.

779
00:56:00,623 --> 00:56:05,060
I always thought the prom queen
should be the girl with the highest I.Q.

780
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:07,587
Now that would make sense.

781
00:56:29,285 --> 00:56:32,846
Finally, a woman without a lab coat.
We got a party now.

782
00:56:33,757 --> 00:56:35,554
You know, I like having you here.
<i>Don't</i> get me wrong.

783
00:56:35,625 --> 00:56:38,594
But <i>I'm</i> not sure Cindy
can handle the competition.

784
00:56:38,661 --> 00:56:42,757
- This is really nice of you.
- Well, they worked hard. They deserve this.

785
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:03,309
Look at Summer.

786
00:57:06,289 --> 00:57:07,586
- Hi.
- Hey.

787
00:57:08,391 --> 00:57:10,757
So, where are you going dressed like that?

788
00:57:10,827 --> 00:57:13,022
Why? Do I look stupid?

789
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:14,961
No, you look nice.

790
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:19,593
- Hi.
- Hey.

791
00:57:21,971 --> 00:57:24,701
- You like it?
- Yeah. You look beautiful.

792
00:57:26,476 --> 00:57:29,001
I thought your necklace looked a little bare,

793
00:57:29,078 --> 00:57:31,342
so I made this for you in R and D.

794
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:40,586
For everything I see in you,
and everything I don't.

795
00:57:44,694 --> 00:57:47,162
I think your powers are wonderful.

796
00:57:49,032 --> 00:57:50,966
<i>I'm</i> not that wonderful.

797
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:53,659
I mean, I just hope you're not disappointed

798
00:57:53,736 --> 00:57:56,500
with what you do or <i>don't</i> see from here.

799
00:57:57,373 --> 00:57:59,603
As long as I get to keep looking,

800
00:57:59,676 --> 00:58:02,611
I guarantee you I'll never be disappointed.

801
00:58:25,435 --> 00:58:27,266
Do you want to dance?

802
00:58:29,873 --> 00:58:30,931
Yes.

803
00:58:31,441 --> 00:58:34,842
Do you mind if we take these off?
Because you are so...

804
00:58:35,745 --> 00:58:36,939
blind.

805
00:58:37,413 --> 00:58:39,176
Whoa. Let me put these back on.

806
00:58:39,249 --> 00:58:40,773
No, <i>it's</i> okay.

807
00:58:41,885 --> 00:58:44,718
You'll just have to move a little closer.

808
00:58:47,757 --> 00:58:49,554
Still <i>can't</i> see you.

809
00:59:00,103 --> 00:59:02,537
What the hey is going on here?

810
00:59:02,605 --> 00:59:04,266
This room is off-limits.

811
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:07,571
Hey. Come on, Your Highness, calm down.
You're going to have a stroke.

812
00:59:07,644 --> 00:59:09,805
Look. Have a drink.
The kids are just having fun.

813
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:12,313
The kids want to have a little fun?
I like to have fun.

814
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:14,748
Kids, <i>let's</i> take a 10-mile run.

815
00:59:15,418 --> 00:59:18,819
Guards. Holloway.
Make sure it happens now. Move out.

816
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:23,288
Boy, for a straight guy, you're dramatic.

817
00:59:25,328 --> 00:59:26,852
<i>What's</i> all this stuff? What are you doing?

818
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:29,592
Something I should have done long ago.

819
00:59:32,835 --> 00:59:34,996
You're going to hurt these kids
like you hurt my team.

820
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:37,699
To meet my standards, whatever it takes.

821
00:59:37,774 --> 00:59:40,800
We'll be starting first thing in the morning.

822
00:59:46,616 --> 00:59:48,345
<i>Let's</i> get cracking.

823
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:56,716
Hey, guys. Everybody. Get up. Come on.
Get up.

824
00:59:58,494 --> 01:00:01,725
Come on, gorgeous. Hop up.
<i>Sleeping's</i> for wimps. Get up. Come on.

825
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:04,164
Come on. Come on.
Come on, come on. There you go.

826
01:00:04,233 --> 01:00:06,360
Everybody. Come on. Get up.

827
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:08,930
Hurry, before the guards see us.

828
01:00:09,005 --> 01:00:12,736
Good, good, good. Figured you guys
would be getting tired of sleeping.

829
01:00:12,809 --> 01:00:16,370
Come on. Tucker, come on, buddy, get up.
Roll that big potato out of bed.

830
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:19,904
Hit your light. There you go, come on.
Get up, get up.

831
01:00:21,651 --> 01:00:22,743
<i>What's</i> the matter with you?

832
01:00:22,819 --> 01:00:26,414
What time did you go to bed last night?
How tired can you guys...

833
01:00:26,589 --> 01:00:31,356
All right. Somebody brush his teeth,
get him in his outfit. <i>Let's</i> go. Come on.

834
01:00:32,195 --> 01:00:33,787
I said <i>let's</i> go.

835
01:00:52,415 --> 01:00:53,905
All right, all right.

836
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:57,316
What are you dressed as, Super-Poodle?
What is that?

837
01:00:59,689 --> 01:01:01,418
Where are we going?

838
01:01:02,291 --> 01:01:05,385
Oh, neat. An electrical panel.

839
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:13,098
<i>It's</i> a secret electrical panel.

840
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:14,329
Quiet.

841
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:17,434
Come on.

842
01:01:20,643 --> 01:01:23,578
<i>I'm</i> tired. <i>Let's</i> go back to bed.

843
01:01:23,646 --> 01:01:25,409
- <i>I'm</i> hungry.
- <i>I'm</i> cold.

844
01:01:25,481 --> 01:01:28,143
Stop whining. Superheroes <i>don't</i> whine.

845
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:32,818
Where are we?

846
01:01:32,889 --> 01:01:36,052
We are someplace
where the cameras <i>won't</i> see us.

847
01:01:37,927 --> 01:01:40,487
- Whoa, what is this?
- Are we getting our names?

848
01:01:40,563 --> 01:01:42,622
Finally, we get our names.

849
01:01:42,965 --> 01:01:45,024
Wait, I thought you said names <i>don't</i> matter.

850
01:01:45,101 --> 01:01:49,162
All right, all right. I was mistaken.
You want names? You got to have names.

851
01:01:49,238 --> 01:01:52,696
Chubby will now be called
<i>"The Incredible Bulk."</i>

852
01:01:52,742 --> 01:01:54,334
- Oh, dude.
- <i>That's</i> stupid.

853
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:57,403
You, the bully, <i>let's</i> call you "Strong <i>Girl."</i>

854
01:01:57,580 --> 01:02:00,071
- I want something pretty.
- That is pretty.

855
01:02:00,116 --> 01:02:01,674
- No, <i>it's</i> not.
- Yes, it is pretty.

856
01:02:01,751 --> 01:02:04,481
And for you, <i>let's</i> go with "Mental <i>Chick."</i>

857
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:06,613
- Mental Chick?
- I like that.

858
01:02:06,689 --> 01:02:08,156
- That is not funny.
- Yes, it is.

859
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:09,816
- I think <i>it's</i> good, 'cause you're...
- I like it.

860
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:11,484
<i>That's</i> terrible. You're not calling me that.

861
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:13,825
Yeah, Mental Chick and Invisiteen.

862
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:16,194
Whoa. No, that is terrible.

863
01:02:16,265 --> 01:02:18,495
- Come on. You're Mega-Boy.
- Mega-Boy?

864
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:20,195
- What do you call me?
- Houdini.

865
01:02:20,269 --> 01:02:22,203
- Houdini?
- You know? <i>He's</i> always escaping stuff.

866
01:02:22,271 --> 01:02:23,636
- Princess.
- Princess.

867
01:02:23,706 --> 01:02:26,072
- And <i>she's</i> Wonder.
- Thanks.

868
01:02:26,142 --> 01:02:29,441
All right, I give up. You guys want to
name yourselves, you've named yourselves.

869
01:02:29,512 --> 01:02:30,809
- Houdini.
- Princess.

870
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,347
- Wonder.
- Mega-Boy.

871
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:35,077
- Now we're a team.
- Now we're a family.

872
01:02:38,488 --> 01:02:40,217
And this family is getting out of here.

873
01:02:40,289 --> 01:02:42,189
<i>I'm</i> taking you someplace safe tonight.

874
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:44,590
- But we're heroes now.
- And we have names and everything.

875
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:46,628
I know you do.
You have names, you're heroes,

876
01:02:46,696 --> 01:02:48,857
but I think <i>it'd</i> be safer
if we just got out of here.

877
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:50,900
Take the FE-12, we can use that and...

878
01:02:52,835 --> 01:02:54,860
<i>What's</i> the matter, Dylan?

879
01:02:55,705 --> 01:02:57,468
<i>I'm in a hallway.</i>

880
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:59,432
Stay out of the <i>ladies'</i> room.

881
01:02:59,509 --> 01:03:01,943
<i>Okay, now, I'm in a control room.</i>

882
01:03:02,245 --> 01:03:06,045
<i>- What do you see?</i>
<i>- I see Dr. Grant and Larraby.</i>

883
01:03:06,716 --> 01:03:09,480
Tell me they're wearing <i>women's</i> dresses.

884
01:03:12,021 --> 01:03:14,489
<i>There's</i> frozen images on a screen.

885
01:03:17,393 --> 01:03:19,258
I know what they're training us for.

886
01:03:19,328 --> 01:03:20,454
What?

887
01:03:21,264 --> 01:03:22,754
Your brother.

888
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:26,728
<i>He's</i> alive. <i>He's</i> coming back.

889
01:03:32,041 --> 01:03:33,508
<i>That's</i> impossible.

890
01:03:33,576 --> 01:03:35,271
Stay out of sight.

891
01:03:38,181 --> 01:03:42,447
<i>General Larraby, it is only a matter</i>
<i>of moments before Concussion will be here.</i>

892
01:03:42,885 --> 01:03:47,288
<i>At 8:59 p.m., the portal broke through</i>
<i>the final dimension.</i>

893
01:03:50,693 --> 01:03:53,560
Wow. Just when I was beginning to like you.

894
01:03:53,629 --> 01:03:56,598
<i>"It's</i> all for the kids, helping them cope,

- What are you talking about?
- Stop the innocent routine, okay?

896
01:04:00,336 --> 01:04:01,462
What?

897
01:04:02,405 --> 01:04:03,497
Jack.

898

<i>That's</i> when we deploy the sonic net.

899

What the <i>hell's</i> going on?

900
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:12,041
Right now, my stomach flesh is burning.

901
01:04:12,114 --> 01:04:15,572
- Jack. Jack, can you talk to me?
- Not now, Holloway.

902
01:04:15,651 --> 01:04:17,414
Guards, get her out of here.

903
01:04:17,486 --> 01:04:20,546
My brother is alive? Why <i>didn't</i> you tell me?

904
01:04:21,123 --> 01:04:25,992
Well, you know... Is that a flock of birds
or my car alarm? Hold on a minute.

905
01:04:26,062 --> 01:04:28,758
We <i>didn't</i> tell you about Connor
because you <i>didn't</i> need to know.

906
01:04:28,831 --> 01:04:32,460
They're going to be heroes, Jack,
and heroes always do the right thing.

907
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:34,833
You're going to send these kids
up against Concussion?

908
01:04:34,904 --> 01:04:36,633
They'll never have a chance.

909
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:40,972
Not the way you've trained them.
Guards, take this bozo away.

They're prepping the Gamma-13.

01:05:48,911 --> 01:05:50,079
I <i>don't</i> know.

923
01:05:58,487 --> 01:06:00,250
Well, I'm...

924
01:06:01,557 --> 01:06:03,354
<i>I'm</i> afraid <i>it's</i> time.

925
01:06:07,763 --> 01:06:10,095
<i>I'm</i> so sorry about this. Truly.

926
01:06:10,299 --> 01:06:12,597
<i>It's</i> okay. We're used to being used.

927
01:06:12,668 --> 01:06:15,762
I know <i>there's</i> nothing I can do
to make this up to you,

928
01:06:15,838 --> 01:06:17,533
except possibly...

929
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:26,008
Tucker.

930
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:34,048
- That was awesome.
- Come on, <i>let's</i> go.

931
01:06:45,798 --> 01:06:47,925
Can I help you, Miss Jones?

932
01:06:50,670 --> 01:06:52,661
Put me down, Miss Jones.

933
01:06:56,676 --> 01:06:58,701
Man, that is so hot.

934
01:06:58,945 --> 01:07:00,435
You think so?

935
01:07:02,515 --> 01:07:05,245
- Hey, not bad. Nice work.
- Thanks.

936
01:07:05,985 --> 01:07:07,646
<i>Hasta luego,</i> man.

937
01:07:08,421 --> 01:07:10,218
I'll check this one.

938
01:07:10,857 --> 01:07:11,983
I think he's...

939
01:07:12,058 --> 01:07:13,821
- Where is he?
- I think <i>he's</i> over here.

940
01:07:13,893 --> 01:07:15,884
No. No. <i>He's</i> right here.

941
01:07:16,896 --> 01:07:20,229
Hey. Somebody call for a rescue party
with extra cheese?

942
01:07:20,566 --> 01:07:22,796
Hey, <i>it's</i> about time. Open the door.

943
01:07:22,869 --> 01:07:24,598
You want to do the honors?

944
01:07:28,107 --> 01:07:30,166
Hey, maybe something like,

945
01:07:30,443 --> 01:07:34,709
<i>"Stand back. We're going to break
the door <i>down"</i> could have been tossed out.

946
01:07:39,385 --> 01:07:43,651
You know <i>there's</i> a little green button
to the left that says, "Open"?

947
01:07:44,991 --> 01:07:46,822
- You all right?
- Yeah.

948
01:07:46,893 --> 01:07:50,385
- Wait. Why is she here?
- No, <i>it's</i> cool. <i>She's</i> one of us.

949
01:07:50,463 --> 01:07:52,658
- What do you mean, <i>she's</i> one of us?
- She blows.

950
01:07:52,732 --> 01:07:54,757
- Yeah.
- No, I mean she blows.

951
01:07:54,834 --> 01:07:56,529
Come on. Show him.

952
01:08:06,279 --> 01:08:07,405
So...

953
01:08:07,914 --> 01:08:09,541
So you've got powers?

954
01:08:09,615 --> 01:08:13,449
Remember I was kind of a weird child?
<i>That's</i> why I came here.

955
01:08:13,786 --> 01:08:15,117
Why <i>didn't</i> you say something?

956
01:08:15,187 --> 01:08:17,382
This is, like, great news.
You're like part of the family.

957
01:08:17,456 --> 01:08:20,448
- Dudes. Escape, remember?
- Right. <i>Let's</i> go.

958
01:08:23,129 --> 01:08:26,929
I want this done as fast and
efficiently as possible. Highest levels.

959
01:08:26,999 --> 01:08:28,296
Yes, sir.

960
01:08:28,501 --> 01:08:29,934
<i>What's</i> that?

961
01:08:30,303 --> 01:08:31,668
<i>What's</i> happening?

962
01:08:34,173 --> 01:08:36,733
Dylan. Open it up.

963
01:08:44,984 --> 01:08:48,715
- What are you doing?
- <i>I'm</i> saving the day. <i>That's</i> what I do.

964
01:08:50,222 --> 01:08:52,349
Summer, get us out of here.

965
01:08:58,030 --> 01:08:59,725
This is all wrong.

966
01:09:04,770 --> 01:09:06,465
This goes there

967
01:09:06,539 --> 01:09:09,201
and that, there.

968
01:09:10,076 --> 01:09:11,976
Hey, Dylan, get inside.

969
01:09:13,245 --> 01:09:14,644
Get inside.

970
01:09:18,517 --> 01:09:20,576
Shut the hangar doors.

971
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:23,618
Shut the hangar doors.

972
01:09:26,792 --> 01:09:27,884
Oh, boy.

973
01:09:30,963 --> 01:09:32,191
Summer.

974
01:09:35,968 --> 01:09:37,868
- We're hot to go.
- Yes.

975
01:09:39,639 --> 01:09:41,004
What about Jack?

976
01:09:56,355 --> 01:09:59,017
<i>T- minus 10 minutes.</i>

977
01:10:08,634 --> 01:10:11,262
<i>You got to drop me off here</i>
<i>and take the kids someplace safe.</i>

978
01:10:11,337 --> 01:10:13,532
- We're not leaving you.
- Well, then, wait here.

979
01:10:13,606 --> 01:10:15,870
At least do that. Wait for me.
Let me talk to my brother.

980
01:10:15,941 --> 01:10:17,135
This is between him and me.

981
01:10:17,209 --> 01:10:18,471
But we're family.

982
01:10:18,544 --> 01:10:21,012
Believe me. I know what <i>I'm</i> doing.

983
01:10:26,452 --> 01:10:28,352
I know what <i>I'm</i> doing.

984
01:10:30,256 --> 01:10:32,156
Yeah.

985
01:10:41,133 --> 01:10:43,294
What am I doing?

986
01:10:46,172 --> 01:10:48,640
Mr. Pibb, <i>Jack's</i> out there all alone.

987
01:10:48,708 --> 01:10:51,836
He needs our help.
Will you distract Concussion?

988
01:10:52,111 --> 01:10:53,339
Please?

989
01:11:14,633 --> 01:11:15,827
Connor.

990
01:11:18,104 --> 01:11:19,799
My God, it is you.

991
01:11:20,906 --> 01:11:23,500
Connor, <i>it's</i> me, Jack. <i>It's</i> Jack.

992
01:11:24,310 --> 01:11:26,335
Nobody wants to fight you.

993
01:11:27,246 --> 01:11:29,043
I just want to talk.

994
01:11:33,486 --> 01:11:34,578
Wow.

995
01:11:35,621 --> 01:11:37,612
- You got old, little brother.
- Yeah.

996
01:11:37,690 --> 01:11:40,659
Well, I guess I <i>didn't</i> have the advantage of

997
01:11:40,726 --> 01:11:43,286
living large in some dimensional rift
where I <i>don't</i> age...

998
01:11:43,362 --> 01:11:45,728
Living large? Try alone.

999
01:11:45,931 --> 01:11:48,491
Conscious only of being betrayed by you
in that living hell.

1000
01:11:48,567 --> 01:11:49,932
Betrayed? You took out the whole team.

1001
01:11:50,002 --> 01:11:52,903
You <i>shouldn't</i> have tried to stop me, Jackie.

1002
01:11:52,972 --> 01:11:54,200
Jackie?

1003
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:57,832
What did Mom tell you
about calling me Jackie?

1004
01:12:06,519 --> 01:12:08,077
That was good.

1005
01:12:08,154 --> 01:12:10,554
Boy, that... That smarts.

1006
01:12:13,926 --> 01:12:16,793
Well, you certainly <i>haven't</i>
lost your touch, brother.

1007
01:12:16,862 --> 01:12:18,796
Have you lost your powers, Jack?

1008
01:12:18,864 --> 01:12:20,092
Well...

1009
01:12:34,079 --> 01:12:36,343
You've got to stop doing that.

1010
01:12:38,150 --> 01:12:40,516
You have lost your powers, Jack.

1011
01:12:40,653 --> 01:12:43,520
Boy. Hey, are those new boots?

1012
01:12:44,190 --> 01:12:48,786
When you say lost my powers,
I think if I really looked, I could find them.

1013
01:12:53,566 --> 01:12:56,126
This is even better than I expected.

1014
01:13:00,306 --> 01:13:03,036
Load up the sonic net and prepare to fire.

1015
01:13:05,377 --> 01:13:08,540
This is it, Jack. I've waited 30 years for this.

1016
01:13:13,118 --> 01:13:14,244
Pibb?

1017
01:13:15,421 --> 01:13:16,547
Pibb?

1018
01:13:16,722 --> 01:13:20,749
Wow. They must have really dragged you
out of the mothballs, huh?

1019
01:13:26,465 --> 01:13:27,659
Steady.

1020
01:13:29,201 --> 01:13:31,863
Well, hope you got an army behind you.

1021
01:13:38,577 --> 01:13:40,704
Or a tiny girl in pigtails.

1022
01:13:41,614 --> 01:13:43,206
What is this, "Attack of the <i>Pre-schoolers"?</i>

1023
01:13:43,282 --> 01:13:45,648
These kids, they <i>don't</i> know what they're
doing, Connor. This is between you and me.

1024
01:13:45,718 --> 01:13:47,379
- So this is the new team, huh?
- Cindy, go back.

1025
01:13:47,453 --> 01:13:51,184
You just run up to the big bad guy
all willy-nilly now? Is that how it goes?

1026
01:13:51,257 --> 01:13:52,383
Fire.

1027
01:14:01,467 --> 01:14:03,662
- Cindy, run.
- No, no.

1028
01:14:03,736 --> 01:14:04,725
Zoom!

1029
01:14:11,610 --> 01:14:13,407
Cindy, are you okay?

1030
01:14:13,779 --> 01:14:17,340
Cindy, you're safe now.
You're okay. <i>It's</i> me. <i>It's</i> Jack.

1031
01:14:17,416 --> 01:14:19,714
Please, Cindy, <i>don't</i> do this to me.

1032
01:14:19,785 --> 01:14:22,345
You're all right. Come on, Princess.

1033
01:14:24,857 --> 01:14:27,052
Princess? <i>That's</i> me.

1034
01:14:28,661 --> 01:14:31,152
Mr. Shepard, you moved so fast.

1035
01:14:34,767 --> 01:14:36,200
Yes, I did.

1036
01:14:41,907 --> 01:14:44,637
I knew it.
I knew you <i>hadn't</i> lost your powers.

1037
01:14:44,710 --> 01:14:46,871
Guess I just needed a reason to use them.

1038
01:14:46,946 --> 01:14:49,414
Jack, <i>I'm</i> sorry. You were right, man.
We <i>weren't</i> ready.

1039
01:14:49,481 --> 01:14:51,915
Yeah, yeah. Come on.
You read the comic books.

1040
01:14:51,984 --> 01:14:54,714
Superhero secret, first plan never works.

1041
01:14:54,787 --> 01:14:57,153
<i>Is that it? Is that all you got?</i>

1042
01:14:57,556 --> 01:14:59,649
Not by a long shot, sonny-boy.

1043
01:15:02,561 --> 01:15:05,052
Stand back. No, no, no.
Everybody, get back.

1044
01:15:06,799 --> 01:15:09,734
Load up the second net and prepare to fire.

1045
01:15:09,802 --> 01:15:11,997
<i>That's</i> a fantastic idea, sir.

1046
01:15:12,071 --> 01:15:13,971
I wish we had a second net.

1047
01:15:14,039 --> 01:15:16,667
Why, you fumbling, bumbling bozo.

1048
01:15:27,286 --> 01:15:30,380
Okay, all right. You guys, wait right here.

1049
01:15:30,723 --> 01:15:33,453
I'll be back in a second, give or take.

1050
01:16:03,389 --> 01:16:05,084
Just like riding a bike.

1051
01:16:13,565 --> 01:16:16,762
Is that it?
Is there anyone else who can face me?

1052
01:16:17,002 --> 01:16:21,268
- <i>I'm</i> still standing here, you little twerp.
- Sir, I <i>wouldn't</i> do that.

1053
01:16:23,475 --> 01:16:25,136
<i>What's</i> that sound?

1054
01:16:27,846 --> 01:16:29,677
- Hey, it's...
- Jackie.

1055
01:16:35,220 --> 01:16:36,517
Actually,

1056
01:16:37,423 --> 01:16:38,754
<i>it's</i> Zoom.

1057
01:16:38,991 --> 01:16:41,755
- Suit looks good.
- Nice suit, lizard-boy.

1058
01:16:45,998 --> 01:16:47,625
<i>Let's</i> play ball.

1059
01:17:01,580 --> 01:17:03,343
- Zoom.
- Hey.

1060
01:17:06,819 --> 01:17:10,311
Hey, Connor.
You kind of suck at this, <i>don't</i> you, dude?

1061
01:17:38,684 --> 01:17:40,811
Oh, no. <i>He's</i> going to miss.

1062
01:17:53,799 --> 01:17:57,132
Zoom. We have a chance to save him.

1063
01:17:57,769 --> 01:18:00,169
You must close the vortex.

1064
01:18:01,106 --> 01:18:03,574
Must save Connor.

1065
01:18:25,764 --> 01:18:27,698
No.

1066
01:18:32,671 --> 01:18:33,899
Connor.

1067
01:18:52,958 --> 01:18:55,791
Connor, the vortex worked this time.

1068
01:18:56,995 --> 01:18:59,725
Maybe you can use your powers for good.

1069
01:19:01,733 --> 01:19:02,961
<i>I'm</i> sorry, Jack.

1070
01:19:03,035 --> 01:19:05,799
Give your little brother a hug. Come on.

1071
01:19:06,038 --> 01:19:07,938
Yeah. I got my brother back.

1072
01:19:08,006 --> 01:19:10,133
- We did it.
- Now <i>that's</i> what I call teamwork.

1073
01:19:10,209 --> 01:19:12,973
This is Connor. This is Dylan. Come on.

1074
01:19:13,111 --> 01:19:15,443
Welcome to the family, brother.

1075
01:19:16,181 --> 01:19:17,273
This is Marsha.

1076
01:19:17,349 --> 01:19:18,907
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.

1077
01:19:18,984 --> 01:19:21,009
- Hi. <i>What's</i> your name?
- Cindy.

1078
01:19:21,153 --> 01:19:22,381
- Cindy.
- Hey. Summer.

1079
01:19:23,989 --> 01:19:26,617
- <i>I'm</i> Tucker. <i>How's</i> it going?
- Tucker, hi.

1080
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:30,323
<i>Somebody's</i> going to have to drive
on the way back. We've got the...

1081
01:19:30,395 --> 01:19:31,953
Can I? Can I drive?

1082
01:19:32,030 --> 01:19:33,759
- Can she drive?
- Yeah, she can drive.

1083
01:19:33,832 --> 01:19:36,164
We got the FE-12 running again.
Remember the old saucer from back then?

1084
01:19:36,235 --> 01:19:38,669
Oh, yeah. Where is it? Out there? Oh, yeah.

1085
01:19:39,137 --> 01:19:40,661
Hold it, Zoom.

1086
01:19:45,978 --> 01:19:47,070
What?

1087
01:19:48,146 --> 01:19:49,807
What are you going to do now?

1088
01:19:49,881 --> 01:19:53,078
You know us heroes.
We always do the right thing.

1089
01:19:54,686 --> 01:19:57,154
Come on, Grant. We got work to do.

1090
01:20:06,431 --> 01:20:10,492
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair.

1091
01:20:10,836 --> 01:20:12,736
<i>It's</i> Princess Rapunzel.

1092
01:20:12,904 --> 01:20:14,166
Whatever.

1093
01:20:35,527 --> 01:20:36,653
Whoa.

1094
01:20:38,196 --> 01:20:39,561
My prince.

1095
01:20:46,104 --> 01:20:47,867
<i>That's</i> my Princess.

1096
01:21:30,849 --> 01:21:32,043
Ready.

1097
01:21:32,984 --> 01:21:34,246
Go, red.

1098
01:21:34,786 --> 01:21:37,482
Go, white. Go, red.

1099
01:21:38,256 --> 01:21:40,349
Fight. Fight. Fight.

1100
01:22:27,272 --> 01:22:31,038
<i>And so, Zoom was reunited with his brother</i>

1101
01:22:31,610 --> 01:22:33,510
<i>and a new Zenith team.</i>

1102
01:22:34,780 --> 01:22:36,748
<i>But they were more than a team.</i>

1103
01:22:36,815 --> 01:22:38,749
<i>They were a family.</i>

1104
01:22:40,118 --> 01:22:41,881
<i>Team Zenith.</i>

1105
01:22:56,401 --> 01:22:57,595
Marker.

1106
01:22:57,669 --> 01:22:58,966
I'll try one time bigger.

1107
01:22:59,037 --> 01:23:00,868
- No, <i>I'm</i> kidding.
- <i>I'm</i> kidding, I got it.

1108
01:23:00,939 --> 01:23:03,066
<i>I'm</i> quicker than you think.

1109
01:23:05,143 --> 01:23:07,634
We're funnier on TV.
Maybe <i>it's</i> the screen size.

1110
01:23:07,712 --> 01:23:09,612
- Lf you went like this.
- Rolling.

1111
01:23:09,681 --> 01:23:12,514
<i>We like to poo in our pants</i>

1112
01:23:13,051 --> 01:23:14,780
<i>We like to poo in our pants</i>

1113
01:23:14,853 --> 01:23:16,616
<i>That's</i> not in the script.

1114
01:23:17,689 --> 01:23:19,714
Look, dude, I <i>don't</i> know.

1115
01:23:23,161 --> 01:23:27,029
- I apologize.
- No, I want to do it just like that.

1116
01:23:27,532 --> 01:23:29,227
These... Have a sensitive condition?

1117
01:23:29,301 --> 01:23:31,360
Who knows? You're the one
<i>who's</i> supposed to say the stuff.

1118
01:23:31,436 --> 01:23:34,405
You're the one on camera.
Who cares about me? Shut up. I'll do it.

1119
01:23:34,473 --> 01:23:36,566
These children have a... Are in a...

1120
01:23:36,641 --> 01:23:38,302
All right. Sorry.

1121
01:23:40,378 --> 01:23:44,576
And you want these little lunatics
to be like me?

1122
01:23:46,885 --> 01:23:48,648
Now I've forgotten exactly what to say

1123
01:23:48,720 --> 01:23:51,245
because I was so in love with Courteney
for just a moment.

1124
01:23:51,323 --> 01:23:52,483
<i>Where's</i> Matt LeBlanc?
