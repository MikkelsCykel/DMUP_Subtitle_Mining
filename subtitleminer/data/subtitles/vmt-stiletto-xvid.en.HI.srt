How much is
enough, Nancy?

401
00:29:38,313 --> 00:29:40,804
I really didn't mean it that way.
I just...

402

I just worry about you. I don't
want anything to happen to you.

Raina, no.

<i>she got here.</i>

<i>And the night that she was supposed
to arrive, I was at home waiting</i>

<i>for this phone call. Virgil's guys were
going to the airport to pick her up.</i>

<i>They were gonna take her to a safe

<i>And that night came,</i>

925

and it passed.
And there was no phone call.

926

<i>Virgil's guy at the airport
said that she never arrived.</i>

And my aunt back home said that
she definitely got on the plane.

<i>And Virgil swore that he didn't
know what happened to her.</i>
