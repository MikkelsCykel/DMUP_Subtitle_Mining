1
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:36,028
Went through the crack--

2
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:38,503
Our twelfth edition of
the Psychic Friends Network--

3
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:39,527
Shea Stadium--

4
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,009
You're watching TV Time...

5
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,705
the only network
playing lots of old stuff...

6
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:48,009
in nothing but black and white.

7
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:52,316
Why, it's fun
for the whole family!

8
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:56,448
TV Time--
remember, you're soaking in it.

9
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:59,049
This Friday on TV Time...

10
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:02,255
Take the phone off the hook
and the plastic off the couch.

11
00:01:02,295 --> 00:01:06,231
That's right,
it's the Pleasantville marathon!

12
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:11,135
24 hours chocked full
of pure family values.

13
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:12,638
Featuring the warm greeting...

14
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:14,230
Honey, I'm home.

15
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:15,639
Proper nutrition...

16
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:16,733
Do you want some more cookies?

17
00:01:16,776 --> 00:01:19,836
And, of course, safe sex.

18
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:21,779
Why, it's a scrapbook...

19
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:23,976
of all your favorite
Pleasantville memories.

20
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:25,780
There's
"Trouble At The Barbershop..."

21
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:27,844
"Fireman For a Day..."

22
00:01:27,887 --> 00:01:29,047
"The Big Game..."

23
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,683
And who could forget
"Bud Gets a Job"?

24
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:33,191
So join all your favorites...

25
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:34,989
Mary Sue, Bud, George,
and Betty...

26
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:38,122
and oh, yes, Mr. Johnson
at the soda shop.

27
00:01:38,164 --> 00:01:39,358
But wait, there's more!

28
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:41,094
If you put
your thinking caps on...

29
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:44,126
you could win $1,000 in our
Pleasantville trivia contest...

30
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:47,105
plus a free trip to the
Pleasantville of your choice.

31
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:51,042
Flash-back
to kinder, gentler times...

32
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:52,772
on the Pleasantville marathon...

33
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:56,111
this Friday only on...

34
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:19,397
I mean, hi.

35
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,907
Look,
you probably don't think...

36
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:24,136
I should be asking you this.

37
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:26,111
I mean,
not knowing you well and all.

38
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:32,511
I--I mean, I know you.
Everybody knows you.

39
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:35,180
I just don't know you...
technically.

40
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:40,455
Anyhow...

41
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,688
I don't know what you're doing
this weekend...

42
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:45,197
but my mom's leaving town...

43
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:48,723
and she's letting me borrow
the car, so, you know...

44
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:01,009
Okey-dokey,
so just give me a call.

45
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:02,207
Let me know.

46
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:05,811
Bye.

47
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:08,013
For those of you going on
to college next year...

48
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:09,885
the chance of finding
a good job...

49
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:13,620
will actually decrease
by the time you graduate.

50
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,457
The available number
of entry-level jobs...

51
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:19,329
will drop 31%
over the next four years.

52
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:24,200
Median income for those jobs
will go down as well.

53
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:27,400
Obviously, my friends,
it's a competitive world...

54
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,705
and good grades
are your only ticket through.

55
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:32,335
In fact, by the year 2000...

56
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:35,575
...chance of contracting HIV
from a non-monogamous life...

57
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:38,209
will climb to 1 in 150.

58
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:42,551
The odds of dying in an auto
accident are only 1 in 2500.

59
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:44,318
Now,
this marks a drastic increase...

60
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:46,825
...from 14 years ago
when ozone depletion...

61
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:48,690
was at just 10%
of its current level.

62
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,923
By the time
you are 30 years old...

63
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:53,865
average global temperature
will have risen 2 1/2 degrees...

64
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,095
causing such
catastrophic consequences...

65
00:03:56,135 --> 00:04:00,731
as typhoons, floods,
widespread drought, and famine.

66
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:05,039
OK, who can tell me
what famine is?

67
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:16,552
Honey, I'm home.

68
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:22,891
Hello, darling.
How was your day?

69
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,397
Oh, swell.
You know, Mr. Connell says...

70
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,558
if things keep going
the way they are...

71
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,091
I might be seeing that promotion
sooner than I thought.

72
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:32,570
Oh, darling, that's wonderful.

73
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,903
I always knew you could do it.

74
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:39,975
Hey, pumpkin, what's that smell?
Is that your meat loaf?

75
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:41,412
It might be.

76
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:42,778
It might be.

77
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:45,283
Oh, pumpkin,
you sure know the way...

78
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:47,650
to this man's heart.

79
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:49,985
No, that was not the deal.

80
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:53,322
No, you have custody
first weekend of every month.

81
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:54,724
This is the first weekend.

82
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:57,389
No. I'm not gonna bail you out.

83
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,126
I'm going out of town
this weekend.

84
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,497
La Costa.

85
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:05,163
Barry, if I want to have a mud
bath with my new boyfriend...

86
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:06,933
that's my business, isn't it?

87
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,271
Hey, where are those kids?

88
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,140
Right behind you, Father.

89
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:13,611
Right behind you, Father.

90
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:18,140
Mother, Father, Bud has
a little surprise for you.

91
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:19,481
What's that, Bud?

92
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:21,146
First place in the science fair.

93
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:24,448
There were
lots of swell projects.

94
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,458
I guess
mine was just the swellest.

95
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:27,959
Darling, that's wonderful...

96
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,224
except there's
no such word as "swellest."

97
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:33,198
Well, gee whiz, Mom,
it wasn't the English fair.

98
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:37,396
No, that's not the point.

99
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:41,100
The point is,
you're supposed to see them.

100
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,631
Fine. See them another time.

101
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:46,377
What's a mother to do?

102
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:48,642
What's a mother to do?

103
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:02,954
OK, in the very first
Pleasantville episode...

104
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:04,690
whose window did Bud break...

105
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:06,699
when he was playing
with his father's golf clubs?

106
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:08,200
Easy. Mr. Jenkins.

107
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:10,668
What job did Mr. Jenkins have?

108
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:14,031
Salesman.

109
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:19,238
What did they name the cat
they found in the gutter?

110
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:20,677
Scout?

111
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:23,045
Marmalade.

112
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:25,676
All right, all right.

113
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,618
Here's one.

114
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:29,621
Why did their parents
come home early...

115
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:31,623
from their weekend at the lake?

116
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:36,294
'Cause Bud didn't
answer the phone...

117
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:38,126
and they were worried about him.

118
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:41,531
Man...you're unbelievable.

119
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:44,536
You'll win this thing for sure.
When is it on?

120
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:49,098
Marathon starts at 6:30,
contest is tomorrow at noon.

121
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:53,374
Thousand bucks, huh?
And it's on all night?

122
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,643
Of course. That's why
they call it a marathon.

123
00:06:58,217 --> 00:07:01,243
Oh, my God, he is so pathetic.

124
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:04,313
I can't believe
you're related to him.

125
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:05,722
Only on my parents' side.

126
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:08,090
Yeah, but you guys
are twins and stuff.

127
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:11,290
You must be from
the cool side of the uterus.

128
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,730
Oh, my God, here they come.

129
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:17,794
Oh, my God,
just don't do anything.

130
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:18,997
What?

131
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,714
Saw you at the mall yesterday.

132
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:32,047
Yeah, I saw you, too.

133
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:35,110
So, you gonna watch
the concert on MTV tonight?

134
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:37,281
Yeah. You?

135
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:44,322
My mom's gonna be out of town.

136
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:49,295
-Cool.
-Cool.

137
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:51,199
It was so amazing, Daph.

138
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:53,831
I was, like,
"My mom's gonna go out of town."

139
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:56,341
And he was like,
"Well, maybe we could..."

140
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:59,367
And I was, "Yeah, sure."
And he was, "Cool."

141
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:02,074
I know. He's so smart.

142
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:06,210
I'm thinking about that
red thing I got at the mall.

143
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:07,617
It's not slutty.

144
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:11,715
It's fun.

145
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:14,282
Well, hello,
he's not coming over to study.

146
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,794
Yeah, I know.

147
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:19,787
Well, sometimes
I'm jealous of you, too.

148
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:23,233
He's not homeless, Howard.
They don't say where he lives.

149
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,002
Well, it's a silly question.

150
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:31,069
Because nobody's homeless
in Pleasantville.

151
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,110
'Cause that's
just not what it's like.

152
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:41,053
Look, Howard, it's almost 6:30.

153
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:42,987
I gotta go.

154
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:12,477
-What are you doing?
-What are you doing?

155
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:16,181
Cut it out, David. Mark Davis
is gonna be here in minutes.

156
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:19,191
Great. The Pleasantville
marathon starts at 6:30.

157
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:22,160
I don't believe this!
He's gonna be here!

158
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:24,025
You can watch it upstairs.

159
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,327
Upstairs?!

160
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:28,424
It doesn't have any stereo!

161
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:34,869
Oh, my God.

162
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,534
Oh, my God!

163
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,739
David, stop stressing.
You can turn it on normally.

164
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:42,873
No, I can't. It's a new TV, Jen.

165
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,509
It doesn't work
without a remote.

166
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:47,109
Oh, my God, he's here!

167
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:57,220
TV repair.

168
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,594
TV repair?

169
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:00,064
Yeah. TV busted?

170
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:03,831
Well, here I am.

171
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:13,239
Holy cow, look at that.

172
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,247
Had a little disaster,
didn't you, fella?

173
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,612
Well, yeah, sort of.

174
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,913
Well, we'll get you fixed up
in no time.

175
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:23,083
I know how
I'd feel if mine went out.

176
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:26,819
Almost like losing a friend.

177
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:30,420
You know,
we didn't call any TV repair.

178
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:33,557
That makes it a lucky day
for both of us, doesn't it?

179
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,567
Do you think
you could do this soon?

180
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:37,899
-It's almost 6:30.
-What's the hurry?

181
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:40,462
Pleasantville marathon
starts at 6:30.

182
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:46,111
Pleasantville?
Gosh, I love that show.

183
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,612
Watched it for years.

184
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,480
That's not the reason.
I've got a date at 6:30.

185
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:52,984
Who did Muffin take
to the masquerade ball...

186
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:54,953
when her date came down
with the measles?

187
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:58,150
-Her father.
-That's right.

188
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:01,159
-And how'd she dress him?
-As Prince Charming.

189
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:04,651
Nice. Remember the one
where Bud lost his cousin...

190
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:07,962
when he was supposed
to be watching him?

191
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,763
What department store
did they go to?

192
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:12,270
-Mclntyre's.
-McGinty's.

193
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:15,102
No. Mclntyre's. Remember?

194
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:17,837
For the very best
in men's attire

195
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:20,937
Head right down to Mclntyre's

196
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,574
That's right.

197
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:29,751
Listen...

198
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:35,657
Why don't you take
this remote instead?

199
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,390
It's got a little more
oomph in it.

200
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,863
Oomph?

201
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:41,992
Sure.
Big beautiful set like that?

202
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:45,003
You want something that'll
put you right in the show.

203
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:52,334
It's great. We'll take it.

204
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:56,712
Thank you.

205
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:59,616
Well, I better get going.

206
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:01,085
Your show's almost on...

207
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,782
and it's almost time
for your date.

208
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:11,189
Take care now.

209
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:38,052
Whether it's on the track
at lndy...

210
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:41,251
or driving around the block,
only new Pennzoil...

211
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:42,920
For program information...

212
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:48,592
Honey, I'm home.

213
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:49,760
Great.

214
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:50,791
Let me see that.

215
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:52,235
No way.

216
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:07,279
Gee whiz, Mary Sue,
why can't I borrow your radio?

217
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:09,253
I promised Betty Jean
she could use it.

218
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,414
Do you mind?

219
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,651
This is only the most important
moment of my life!

220
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:14,682
Forget it, Jen!
I've waited a year for this!

221
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:17,457
Come on, David,
just give it to me!

222
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:19,862
-Forget it!
-No way, Bud!

223
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,731
Forget it, Mary Sue!

224
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:25,999
Come on, Bud!
It's mine! Give it back!

225
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:37,212
Oh, my God.

226
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:39,843
-What happened?
-I'm not sure.

227
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:44,313
Hi, Sport. Hi, Muffin.

228
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:46,881
Better get a move on.
You'll be late for school.

229
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:50,825
-What did you do?
-I don't know.

230
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:55,359
Look at me! I'm pasty!

231
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:57,164
Over here!

232
00:13:58,237 --> 00:14:00,432
Told you it was your lucky day.

233
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:02,770
I bet you thought
I was just a fan or something.

234
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:04,275
What happened?

235
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:07,006
A miracle. Every time
I thought I'd found someone...

236
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:08,980
they'd turn out
to disappoint me.

237
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:12,177
They'd know the early episodes,
but not the later ones.

238
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:15,676
They'd know all about Muffin,
but not about Bud.

239
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:17,120
What the hell is going on?

240
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:19,522
Can't talk like that here.

241
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:22,721
You're in...Well, you know.

242
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:25,855
Bud, Mary Sue,
breakfast is on the table.

243
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:28,025
We're in Pleasantville?

244
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:30,160
A dream come true, huh?

245
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,897
Listen, this really isn't funny.

246
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:34,462
I have a very important date
in five minutes!

247
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:36,633
You don't have to worry
about that anymore.

248
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:41,906
Bitch.

249
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:44,815
You have got to get us
out of here!

250
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:47,080
-Why would I do that?
-Because we don't belong!

251
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:50,748
Sure you do.
Mclntyre's department store...

252
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:52,757
their father dressed
as Prince Charming.

253
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,554
That was gorgeous, Bud.

254
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:57,494
-My name is David!
-Oh, God!

255
00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:00,327
This is a strange way of
showing your appreciation.

256
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:02,334
Hey, we appreciate it.
We really do.

257
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:04,268
We just want to go home now.

258
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:07,704
But you don't know how long I've
looked for someone like you.

259
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,073
I'm very disappointed.

260
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,510
In fact, I'm starting
to get a little upset.

261
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:15,172
No, don't get upset.

262
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:18,149
Well, wouldn't you?
You look for someone for years.

263
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:20,549
You pour your heart into it--

264
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,111
This is a privilege, you know!

265
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:25,680
I don't think I'd better
talk about this now.

266
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:27,191
Where are you going?

267
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:30,627
I don't think we should discuss
this until I'm composed.

268
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:32,130
Wait a minute!

269
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:34,655
Maybe in a while
when I'm not so emotional!

270
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:38,363
Give you a week or two
to change your attitude!

271
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:40,463
Come back!

272
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:41,803
Come back!

273
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,779
A week or two?

274
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:56,412
Oh, God.

275
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,685
What's gonna happen?

276
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:01,488
I don't know. It's not possible.
Is it possible?

277
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:04,894
Bud, Mary Sue,
your breakfast is getting cold.

278
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:07,660
It can't be possible.

279
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:20,440
Well, come on, kids.

280
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,846
You're not going to school
without breakfast inside you.

281
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:27,712
Forward march.

282
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,308
I just love you in that sweater,
Mary Sue.

283
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,640
It's so flattering.

284
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,270
Thanks.

285
00:16:57,249 --> 00:16:58,341
Morning, kids.

286
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:01,911
Better get a move on,
or you'll be late for school.

287
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:03,683
I don't believe this.

288
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:05,121
Neither do l.

289
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:07,387
Well, come on, dig in.

290
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:10,054
I put blueberries in them
just the way you like.

291
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,863
Well, come on, sweetie,
it's getting late.

292
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:19,662
Actually, I'm not hungry.

293
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:23,234
Nonsense, young lady.

294
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:26,073
You're gonna start your day off
with a nice, big breakfast.

295
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:28,204
Here we go. Sit down.

296
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:33,008
Here's some pancakes and eggs.

297
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:39,457
Sausage and
some good crisp bacon.

298
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,854
And, of course, a ham steak.

299
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:51,098
You eat on up,
then it's off to school.

300
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:00,611
Hurry, hurry.

301
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:12,615
I'm gonna hurl, David,
I swear to God.

302
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:14,353
Just take deep breaths.

303
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:18,159
It's all that animal fat.
I can feel it in my pores.

304
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:20,222
I still don't see why
we're doing this.

305
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,892
Because we're supposed
to be in school.

306
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,925
We're supposed to be at home.

307
00:18:23,969 --> 00:18:25,903
We're supposed to be in color!

308
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,064
Oh, God!

309
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,767
Hello, Bud.

310
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,775
Hello, Mr. Simpson.

311
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,607
Hear your dad's got a new car.

312
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:38,105
Oh, yeah. A Buick. It's swell.

313
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,209
Great.

314
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,711
Do you know that guy?

315
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:46,781
Yeah.
He owns the hardware store.

316
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:48,986
You listen to me
for just a minute!

317
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:52,121
I don't know what you've done,
but you better fix it!

318
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:54,598
I had a date with Mark Davis,
and I even bought new underwear!

319
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:57,602
We have to play along
until that guy shows up again.

320
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,126
Play along?

321
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:02,197
Yes! I am Bud Parker,
and you are Mary Sue.

322
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:06,073
No. I'm not gonna do it.

323
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,079
If I don't dress like this
for Mom...

324
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:09,444
I'm sure not gonna
do it for you!

325
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,449
We have no choice, Jen.

326
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,212
We are stuck here
until that guy shows up again.

327
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:15,117
Why can't we just explain it
to somebody?

328
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,815
To who?

329
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:31,168
Go! Go! Go!

330
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,971
Here, kitty.

331
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:48,878
Oh, God.

332
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:50,388
We are.

333
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:55,058
We're stuck in Nerdville.

334
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:03,662
I knew you'd pay a price
for this.

335
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,329
I knew you couldn't be
so hopelessly geek-ridden...

336
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:11,104
for so long without suffering
some really tragic consequences.

337
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:13,134
But it's just not fair.

338
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:16,409
I was getting really popular.

339
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:20,407
Debbie Russell transferred
to another school...

340
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:22,920
and my skin was really great
since March.

341
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:25,321
Mark Davis was finally starting
to come around.

342
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:26,517
Hello, Mary Sue.

343
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:34,891
What's all the commotion?
Where's the cat?

344
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:39,796
It's...

345
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:48,044
Right.

346
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:52,481
I'll see you at school,
Mary Sue.

347
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:03,722
Who's that?

348
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:08,096
Skip Martin,
captain of the basketball team.

349
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:10,033
Does he like me?

350
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,904
As a matter of fact, he does.

351
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,354
Those are my friends?

352
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:35,451
Peggy Jane, Lisa Anne,
Betty Jean.

353
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:37,928
Can we do any better?

354
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,454
I don't think so.

355
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:54,940
Last week, class, we discussed
the geography of Main Street.

356
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:59,246
This week we're going to be
talking about Elm Street.

357
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:02,185
Now, can anyone tell me
the difference...

358
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:05,053
between Elm Street
and Main Street?

359
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,250
Tommy.

360
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:08,316
It's not as long?

361
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,828
That's right, Tommy.
It's not as long.

362
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:13,660
Also, it only has houses...

363
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:17,931
so the geography of Main Street
is different...

364
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:20,460
than the geography
of Elm Street.

365
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:25,735
Yeah. What's outside
of Pleasantville?

366
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:35,315
I don't understand.

367
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:38,949
Outside of Pleasantville.

368
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,582
What's at
the end of Main Street?

369
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:45,854
Mary Sue, you should know
the answer to that.

370
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:50,493
The end of Main Street
is just the beginning again.

371
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:56,828
Come on, men, let's go!

372
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:03,169
That's it, men, keep it up.
Big game tomorrow.

373
00:24:16,254 --> 00:24:17,312
Hiya, Bud.

374
00:24:17,355 --> 00:24:18,322
Hiya, Skip.

375
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:19,721
Hiya, Bud.

376
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,093
Hiya, Skip.

377
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,254
Bud, can I ask you a question?

378
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:25,729
Sure.

379
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:28,528
Well...

380
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:31,001
If I was
to go up to your sister...

381
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:33,027
What I mean is,
if I was to go up to Mary Sue--

382
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:36,131
Oh, my God.
Are we in that episode?

383
00:24:36,174 --> 00:24:38,802
-What?
-I don't believe this.

384
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:40,004
What's the matter?

385
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:43,674
You want to ask her out tonight
and give her your school pin.

386
00:24:43,715 --> 00:24:45,205
Yeah. How'd you know?

387
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,787
Look, Skip, I don't think...

388
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:52,016
it's a real good time for that
right now.

389
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:54,287
What do you mean?

390
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:57,523
Well, what I mean is...

391
00:24:57,562 --> 00:25:00,656
Mary Sue's
a little different lately.

392
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:03,327
She won't go out with me?

393
00:25:03,368 --> 00:25:05,359
No, hey, I didn't say that.

394
00:25:05,403 --> 00:25:08,930
I don't know what I'd do
if she wouldn't go out with me.

395
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:30,285
Come here, guys.
Don't touch it. Stay back.

396
00:25:30,328 --> 00:25:32,819
I'm sure
we'll work something out.

397
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:35,992
-I thought you liked him.
-Yeah, but I don't know.

398
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:39,265
One date, Jen.
That's all I'm asking.

399
00:25:39,304 --> 00:25:41,135
If you don't go out
with this guy...

400
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:42,901
we could throw their whole
universe out of whack.

401
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:45,535
It's too weird, David.
This place gives me the creeps.

402
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:46,908
Did you know
the books are blank?

403
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:49,072
-What?
-I went in the library.

404
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:50,547
They have covers
and nothing inside of them.

405
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:52,413
What were you
doing in a library?

406
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:55,419
I got lost.
Oh, wait, look at this.

407
00:25:55,453 --> 00:25:57,921
Know why the firemen
only rescue cats out of trees?

408
00:25:57,956 --> 00:26:00,390
-Nothing burns around here.
-Jen, stop!

409
00:26:00,425 --> 00:26:04,122
They don't even need firemen!
I could really use a cigarette!

410
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:07,689
Jen, listen.
I will get us out of here.

411
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:10,098
I really will,
but if we don't play along...

412
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:12,535
we can alter
their whole existence...

413
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,505
and then we may never get home.

414
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:17,099
You really think
anybody's gonna notice...

415
00:26:17,142 --> 00:26:19,576
if I don't have
a chocolate malt with this guy?

416
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:24,407
You won't believe
what we just heard!

417
00:26:24,449 --> 00:26:28,180
-Skip's gonna ask you out!
-That's not all!

418
00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:30,983
He's gonna give you his pin!

419
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:37,091
Are you sure
I'm supposed to wear this?

420
00:26:37,128 --> 00:26:39,926
I could kill a guy
with these things.

421
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:41,455
It's in your closet.

422
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:43,524
I've worn kinky stuff before--

423
00:26:43,568 --> 00:26:46,503
-He won't notice anyway.
-Why not?

424
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:49,632
They just don't notice
that kind of thing around here.

425
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:53,735
-So what's the point?
-Jen, please.

426
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:56,246
Hello. I've got three pounds
of underwire on here.

427
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:59,341
Just go with the program.
I'm late for work.

428
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:00,646
Work?

429
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:16,195
Yeah, sorry.
I just had to help my folks...

430
00:27:16,234 --> 00:27:19,169
and then I couldn't find my hat.

431
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:21,798
I didn't know what to do.

432
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,774
What's wrong?

433
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:26,743
Well, I always
wipe down the counter...

434
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:29,406
and then you set out
the napkins and glasses...

435
00:27:29,447 --> 00:27:32,177
and then I make
the French fries.

436
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:36,176
But you didn't come
so I just kept on wiping.

437
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:43,425
I'm sorry.

438
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,465
You know,
if this ever happens again...

439
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:57,432
You can make the fries...

440
00:27:57,475 --> 00:27:59,568
even if I haven't put out
the napkins yet.

441
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,941
Thank you.

442
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:32,201
There aren't any cheeseburgers.

443
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:34,336
What?

444
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:37,542
Usually, I put out the burger
and you finish with the lettuce.

445
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:40,551
OK, listen.
Do you have the lettuce?

446
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,287
Have you cooked the burgers?

447
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:47,024
Put on the lettuce,
finish the burger...

448
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:49,117
and pretend it was me doing it
the whole time.

449
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:52,419
You can do it, really.

450
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:12,743
I sure am glad you said
you'd come out with me tonight.

451
00:29:12,784 --> 00:29:16,379
Well, gee whiz, Skip.
I sure am glad you asked me.

452
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:20,084
I don't know if I ever said this
to you before...

453
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:23,754
but I think you're just
about the keenest girl...

454
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:24,955
in the whole school.

455
00:29:24,996 --> 00:29:27,487
Really, Skip? The keenest?

456
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:29,397
Oh, yeah.

457
00:29:30,635 --> 00:29:33,069
What can I get you two?

458
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,231
I don't know, Bud.

459
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:38,174
I guess I'll have my usual
cheeseburger and a cherry Coke.

460
00:29:38,209 --> 00:29:43,112
I don't know, Bud.
I'll have a salad and an Evian.

461
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:47,511
Cheeseburger it is.

462
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:50,610
You see?

463
00:29:50,655 --> 00:29:53,419
The whole time we were in Civics
together...

464
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:56,086
I really wanted to come over
and sit next to you...

465
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:58,960
but you were always sat between
Lisa Anne and Peggy Jane.

466
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:03,366
And you always seemed
so smart and everything.

467
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:06,564
Like that report you did
on our town hall.

468
00:30:06,604 --> 00:30:10,005
Gosh. I didn't know
what I'd talk to you about.

469
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:14,705
Yeah. Well, sometimes
talking's overrated.

470
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:16,111
Don't you think?

471
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:20,616
Oh, right.

472
00:30:21,686 --> 00:30:24,883
So I know I haven't been steady
with anybody or anything...

473
00:30:24,923 --> 00:30:27,357
but I just don't want
to rush it.

474
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:29,917
There's kids that are even
holding hands already...

475
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:33,897
but I figure there's plenty
of time for that later on.

476
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:39,534
Can you excuse me
for just a second?

477
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:52,511
Oh, God.

478
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,184
Oh, God.

479
00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:59,349
-Did he give it to you?
-I bet he did.

480
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:00,982
I don't think he knows how.

481
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:03,994
I bet he's gonna take her
to Lovers Lane.

482
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:05,757
I bet he is.

483
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:08,265
I bet
he's even gonna hold her hand.

484
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:21,575
So, anyhow, I really wanted
to sit next to you in Civics--

485
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:24,013
-You want to get out of here?
-What?

486
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:25,845
Do you want to go somewhere?

487
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:28,250
But where could we go?

488
00:31:28,286 --> 00:31:29,981
Lovers Lane.

489
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:33,415
Lovers Lane?

490
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:37,485
Yeah, Lover's Lane.
You up for it?

491
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,054
Come on.

492
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:41,588
Come on.

493
00:31:49,507 --> 00:31:50,974
Oh, shit.

494
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:52,943
Jennifer!

495
00:31:52,977 --> 00:31:55,639
Jennifer, stop!

496
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,511
Stop!

497
00:31:57,548 --> 00:32:00,449
You can't do this, Jennifer!
He doesn't exist!

498
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:03,818
You can't do this to someone
who doesn't exist!

499
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:11,721
It sure is pretty.

500
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:15,790
Oh, yeah. Gorgeous.

501
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:19,530
To be honest, Mary Sue,
I didn't think you'd want...

502
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:22,164
to come here until we'd been
pinned for a little while.

503
00:32:22,206 --> 00:32:27,007
Oh, Skip, you can pin me
anytime you want to.

504
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:32,910
Or maybe I should just pin you.

505
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,681
That's silly, Mary Sue.

506
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,620
How could you possibly pin me?

507
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:01,809
Son, what's wrong?

508
00:33:01,846 --> 00:33:04,041
Have you seen Mary Sue?

509
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:06,516
No. She's still out with Skip.
Is something the matter?

510
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:09,384
No.
I was just worried about her.

511
00:33:16,694 --> 00:33:19,356
Bud, your sister's
getting older now.

512
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:22,025
She'll naturally
be going out with boys.

513
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,165
But she's a fine young woman.

514
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:28,263
She would never do anything
for us to be concerned about.

515
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:31,336
Honest.

516
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:51,317
I think I better go home now,
Mary Sue.

517
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:52,761
Why?

518
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:56,756
I think I might be ill.

519
00:33:56,801 --> 00:33:59,031
Something's happening to me.

520
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:01,937
That's supposed to happen.

521
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:05,032
It is?

522
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:07,510
Yeah. Trust me.

523
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,942
Do you want some more cookies?

524
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:15,077
No, thanks. I'm fine.

525
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:20,449
How about
some marshmallow rice squares?

526
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:21,924
Those are swell.

527
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:23,688
No, I'm fine, thank you.

528
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:27,864
-Who could that be?
-I've got it.

529
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:36,101
Hi. You took off so quick
I wasn't sure you were OK.

530
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:39,735
No, I'm fine.
I just had to get home early.

531
00:34:39,777 --> 00:34:43,144
You know how when we close up...

532
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:45,877
I close the register,
then you lower the blinds...

533
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:49,114
and I turn out the lights,
and we both lock the doors?

534
00:34:49,153 --> 00:34:53,021
Well, you weren't around
this time...

535
00:34:53,057 --> 00:34:58,324
so I did the whole thing
by myself.

536
00:34:58,362 --> 00:35:00,489
Wow.

537
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:05,799
And I didn't even do it
in the same order.

538
00:35:05,837 --> 00:35:09,500
First I lowered the blinds,
then I closed the register.

539
00:35:12,143 --> 00:35:14,976
Hello, Betty.

540
00:35:15,012 --> 00:35:17,037
Hello, Bill.

541
00:35:22,353 --> 00:35:25,186
OK, well, that's great.
Thank you for stopping by.

542
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:26,554
I appreciate it.

543
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:33,487
I'll see you tomorrow.

544
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:38,468
Well, gee, thanks, Skip.
I sure had a wonderful time.

545
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:43,269
Me, too.

546
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:45,298
Night.

547
00:36:01,459 --> 00:36:03,484
Hello, Mr. Johnson.

548
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:05,155
Oh, hello, Mary Sue.

549
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:09,432
-What did you do to him?
-Nothing.

550
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:12,766
What do you mean, "nothing"?
That's not nothing.

551
00:36:12,803 --> 00:36:16,239
Why don't you relax, Bud?
We had a nice time.

552
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:19,368
I am really sleepy,
and I have to wake up...

553
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:22,208
early in the morning
to go to school. Night.

554
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:08,889
Hi. Looks like it's gonna be
another beautiful sunny day.

555
00:37:08,926 --> 00:37:12,157
High 72, low 72,
not a cloud in the sky.

556
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:17,024
It's 8:00 in the morning.
Are you watching television?

557
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:47,761
Oh, no.

558
00:37:47,798 --> 00:37:49,527
Come on, men.
Let's get in positions.

559
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:52,502
We got a big game next week.
Let's go.

560
00:37:52,536 --> 00:37:53,764
Come on.

561
00:38:00,044 --> 00:38:02,911
Oh, my God.

562
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:06,347
You can't do this, Jennifer.
I warned you.

563
00:38:06,384 --> 00:38:07,976
So what's the big deal?

564
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:09,987
OK. They're not good
at basketball anymore.

565
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:12,285
Oh, my God. What a tragedy.

566
00:38:12,323 --> 00:38:13,449
You don't understand.

567
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:15,755
You're messing with
their whole goddam n universe.

568
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:17,784
Maybe it needs
to be messed with, David.

569
00:38:17,828 --> 00:38:19,261
Did that ever occur to you?

570
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,924
Hey, M.S., how you doing?

571
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,626
Cool, P.J., how you doing?

572
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:26,125
Cool. Cool.

573
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:27,296
Cool.

574
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:29,932
"Cool"? What are you
doing to these people?

575
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:32,807
-lf I don't, who will?
-But they're happy.

576
00:38:32,843 --> 00:38:36,074
Nobody is happy in a
poodle skirt and a sweater set.

577
00:38:37,682 --> 00:38:39,582
You really like this, don't you?

578
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:43,451
No, it's not like
you think it's funny or dorky.

579
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:45,614
You really like it.

580
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:47,180
No. You have it all wrong.

581
00:38:47,224 --> 00:38:48,816
I am personally mortified
to be your sister.

582
00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:50,827
You have no right
to do this to them.

583
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:52,658
David, listen to me
for just a minute.

584
00:38:52,697 --> 00:38:55,825
They don't want to be geeks.
They want to be attractive.

585
00:38:55,866 --> 00:38:58,198
They have a lot of potential.
They just don't know any better.

586
00:38:58,235 --> 00:38:59,862
They don't have
that kind of potential.

587
00:38:59,904 --> 00:39:02,202
Oh, yeah? Look at that.

588
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:08,543
Wow. What happened to your gum?

589
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:09,705
I gotta go.

590
00:39:09,747 --> 00:39:11,408
I'm gonna meet Skip
at the flagpole.

591
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:57,587
Well, I don't think
it's anything to worry about.

592
00:39:57,628 --> 00:40:00,096
You cut down on greasy
foods and chocolate.

593
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:02,190
You know, things like that.

594
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,997
It'll probably just clear up
on its own.

595
00:40:10,207 --> 00:40:12,471
Jesus Christ.

596
00:40:37,401 --> 00:40:39,961
Do you think we could have
two cheeseburgers...

597
00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:41,699
and some cherry Cokes?

598
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:45,904
I'll be right with you.

599
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:47,535
Thanks.

600
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:56,518
Two cheeseburgers,
two cherry Cokes.

601
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:02,087
There aren't any cheeseburgers.

602
00:41:05,262 --> 00:41:07,856
I thought
we talked about this.

603
00:41:07,898 --> 00:41:09,365
What's the point, Bud?

604
00:41:10,367 --> 00:41:13,495
You make hamburgers.
That is the point.

605
00:41:13,537 --> 00:41:15,471
No. I know I do.

606
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:19,272
It's always the same, you know?

607
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:22,006
Grill the bun, flip the meat,
melt the cheese.

608
00:41:22,046 --> 00:41:24,981
It never changes.
It never gets better or worse.

609
00:41:25,015 --> 00:41:26,949
OK, just listen for a second.

610
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:28,975
The other night when I closed
by myself, that was different.

611
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:31,078
Forget about that!

612
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:36,425
I really liked it, though.

613
00:41:38,462 --> 00:41:39,429
Come here.

614
00:41:44,201 --> 00:41:45,498
Look.

615
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:48,437
You can't always
like what you do.

616
00:41:48,472 --> 00:41:51,600
Sometimes you just gotta do it
because it's your job.

617
00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:54,736
And even if you don't like it,
you just gotta do it anyway.

618
00:41:54,778 --> 00:41:56,040
Why?

619
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,571
So they can have
their hamburgers!

620
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:01,407
I'm sorry.

621
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:02,851
You know what I really like?

622
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:05,981
-What's that?
-Christmas time.

623
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:08,719
See, every year on December 3...

624
00:42:08,759 --> 00:42:11,523
I get to paint the Christmas
decorations in the window...

625
00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:14,156
and every year I get to paint
a different thing.

626
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:16,723
Here, I'll show you.

627
00:42:22,439 --> 00:42:23,929
Wow. That's pretty good.

628
00:42:23,974 --> 00:42:25,839
Thanks, but this morning
I was thinking...

629
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:28,970
and I realized that I look
forward to it all year.

630
00:42:29,013 --> 00:42:31,106
And then I thought,
"Gee, that seems awfully silly.

631
00:42:31,148 --> 00:42:34,276
"lt seems like a long time
to wait for just one moment."

632
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:35,717
Don't you think?

633
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:39,052
Well, don't you?

634
00:42:39,089 --> 00:42:43,651
I think that you should try not
to think about that anymore.

635
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:48,155
I'll try that, then.

636
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:53,503
-Morning, Jim.
-How are you, Bill?

637
00:42:53,537 --> 00:42:56,028
Have they ever lost before?

638
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:58,303
Basketball?
No, they sure haven't.

639
00:42:58,342 --> 00:43:00,867
It just feels wrong, that's all.

640
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:03,072
Maybe that's where
they get that saying...

641
00:43:03,113 --> 00:43:04,876
"You can't win 'em all."

642
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:07,406
That's a good point, Ralph.
They do have that saying.

643
00:43:07,451 --> 00:43:11,046
But they do win 'em all.
They've always won 'em all.

644
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:14,785
Mr. Mayor, here. Go ahead.

645
00:43:14,825 --> 00:43:18,818
Don't be silly, Roy. I couldn't
possibly take your spot.

646
00:43:20,831 --> 00:43:24,096
What I want to know is,
if they've never lost before...

647
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:27,900
and they've never tied before,
isn't that winning 'em all?

648
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:31,135
He's right.
That's what you call it.

649
00:43:31,175 --> 00:43:33,609
Yeah, that's true.

650
00:43:33,644 --> 00:43:35,976
He said it would clear up
on its own...

651
00:43:36,013 --> 00:43:39,949
if she just stayed away
from fried foods and sweets.

652
00:43:39,984 --> 00:43:46,150
Except it's spread
to her lips now, too.

653
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:47,680
Oh, I don't know.

654
00:43:47,725 --> 00:43:50,956
And you say it was just red?

655
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:54,863
Well, you know, like real red.

656
00:43:54,898 --> 00:43:56,593
I know what you mean.

657
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:58,465
That's like this car
that was in front...

658
00:43:58,502 --> 00:44:00,402
of Bill Johnson's soda shop.

659
00:44:00,437 --> 00:44:03,634
I was going by it
and it looked green.

660
00:44:03,674 --> 00:44:06,802
Real green.
Have you seen him lately?

661
00:44:06,844 --> 00:44:08,641
I was getting my sewing machine
fixed across the street...

662
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:12,843
and he was sitting in the window
of his shop just staring.

663
00:44:12,883 --> 00:44:16,250
That is strange.

664
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:29,389
It's your bid, Betty.

665
00:44:39,109 --> 00:44:42,101
What goes on up at Lovers Lane?

666
00:44:43,447 --> 00:44:45,074
What do you mean?

667
00:44:45,115 --> 00:44:48,846
Well, you hear
these things lately--

668
00:44:48,886 --> 00:44:50,751
kids spending so much time
up there.

669
00:44:50,788 --> 00:44:54,451
Is it holding hands?
That kind of thing?

670
00:44:55,592 --> 00:44:57,719
That and...

671
00:44:58,796 --> 00:45:00,229
What?

672
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:03,492
It doesn't matter.

673
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:06,162
No. I want to know.

674
00:45:08,305 --> 00:45:11,604
Well...sex.

675
00:45:16,747 --> 00:45:18,237
What's sex?

676
00:45:24,455 --> 00:45:26,514
You sure you want to know this?

677
00:45:29,593 --> 00:45:32,289
Well...

678
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:34,388
You see, Mom...

679
00:45:34,431 --> 00:45:37,764
when two people really love
each other very, very much...

680
00:45:37,801 --> 00:45:40,269
and they want to share that...

681
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:50,611
Are you OK?

682
00:45:54,618 --> 00:45:56,950
It's just that...

683
00:45:58,188 --> 00:46:02,648
your father would never
do anything like that.

684
00:46:08,031 --> 00:46:12,331
Well, you know, Mom...

685
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:15,463
there are other ways
to enjoy yourself...

686
00:46:15,506 --> 00:46:17,736
without Dad.

687
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:35,854
Sweetie, you coming to bed?

688
00:46:37,327 --> 00:46:41,093
Yeah. I'm just going
to take a bath first.

689
00:47:17,568 --> 00:47:20,128
Oh, my goodness.

690
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:07,274
Oh, shit.

691
00:48:13,323 --> 00:48:14,790
Oh, God.

692
00:48:20,964 --> 00:48:22,898
Fire!

693
00:48:43,787 --> 00:48:45,516
Cat?

694
00:48:56,466 --> 00:48:58,366
OK, right here.

695
00:48:58,402 --> 00:49:00,700
All right, stop.

696
00:49:00,737 --> 00:49:02,170
Stop!

697
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:08,237
Where is it?

698
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:09,438
Whoa!

699
00:49:18,055 --> 00:49:20,615
Here, grab the nozzle.

700
00:49:20,657 --> 00:49:23,626
-But where's the cat?
-Just hold on tight.

701
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:25,924
Whoa!

702
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:28,989
So that's what these things do.

703
00:49:32,336 --> 00:49:35,965
In honor and in recognition
of your heroism...

704
00:49:36,006 --> 00:49:40,272
and with great appreciation from
the citizens of Pleasantville...

705
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:43,746
I am pleased to present you with
this special commendation...

706
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:46,044
from the Pleasantville
Chamber of Commerce.

707
00:50:10,207 --> 00:50:13,643
-That sure was swell.
-Thank you, Margaret.

708
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:17,204
I baked you
some of my oatmeal cookies.

709
00:50:17,247 --> 00:50:20,944
Oh, no.
You baked those for Whitey.

710
00:50:20,984 --> 00:50:23,282
No. I baked them for you.

711
00:50:24,621 --> 00:50:26,020
No. You baked them for Whitey.

712
00:50:26,056 --> 00:50:28,581
-I baked them for you.
-No--

713
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:31,594
No. I baked them for you.

714
00:50:34,631 --> 00:50:35,996
Thank you.

715
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,297
Sure.

716
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:18,965
What's going on?

717
00:51:19,009 --> 00:51:22,672
I'm not sure.
They want to ask you a question.

718
00:51:22,712 --> 00:51:24,805
I didn't really know
how to handle it.

719
00:51:33,123 --> 00:51:34,283
How you doing?

720
00:51:40,464 --> 00:51:43,297
You wanted to ask me something?

721
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:49,536
How'd you know about the fire?

722
00:51:49,573 --> 00:51:50,562
What?

723
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:56,541
How'd you know
how to put it out?

724
00:51:59,416 --> 00:52:04,581
Well, where I used to live,
that's just what firemen did.

725
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:09,251
And where's that?

726
00:52:15,332 --> 00:52:18,165
Outside of Pleasantville.

727
00:52:24,841 --> 00:52:27,139
What's outside of Pleasantville?

728
00:52:27,177 --> 00:52:30,772
It doesn't matter.
It's not important.

729
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:33,248
What's outside of Pleasantville?

730
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:57,306
There are some places...

731
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:01,333
that the road doesn't go
in a circle.

732
00:53:01,378 --> 00:53:04,313
There are some places
where the road keeps going.

733
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:05,712
Keeps going?

734
00:53:08,451 --> 00:53:09,884
Keeps going?

735
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:13,447
Yeah, it just keeps going.

736
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:16,948
It all keeps going.
Roads and rivers.

737
00:53:16,993 --> 00:53:18,858
Like the mighty Mississippi?

738
00:53:18,895 --> 00:53:20,089
What?

739
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:29,564
I thought the books were blank.

740
00:53:29,606 --> 00:53:31,096
They were.

741
00:53:32,609 --> 00:53:34,873
This was not my fault.

742
00:53:34,911 --> 00:53:36,378
When they asked me
what it was about...

743
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:39,348
I didn't remember because
I read it back in tenth grade.

744
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:40,906
When I told them
what I did remember...

745
00:53:40,951 --> 00:53:42,782
that's when the pages filled in.

746
00:53:42,819 --> 00:53:45,049
The pages filled in?

747
00:53:45,088 --> 00:53:48,080
But only up until the part
with the raft...

748
00:53:48,124 --> 00:53:49,921
'cause that's as far as I read.

749
00:53:51,661 --> 00:53:54,061
Do you know how it ends?

750
00:53:54,097 --> 00:53:56,793
-Yeah, I do.
-So how does it end?

751
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:07,171
Well, OK.

752
00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:09,178
Let's see,
they were running away--

753
00:54:09,212 --> 00:54:10,975
Huck and the slave.

754
00:54:11,014 --> 00:54:13,710
They were going up the river,
trying to get free.

755
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:16,913
And, in trying to get free...

756
00:54:16,953 --> 00:54:20,650
they see that
they're sort of free already.

757
00:54:26,229 --> 00:54:27,457
Oh, my God.

758
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:35,165
What about this one?

759
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:39,470
Oh, yeah. This is great.

760
00:54:39,509 --> 00:54:43,570
This kid Holden Caulfield.
He's a really lonely kid.

761
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:45,945
He gets kicked out
of boarding school.

762
00:55:05,568 --> 00:55:08,059
Look at 'em.

763
00:55:08,104 --> 00:55:10,072
It's spreadin'
all over the place.

764
00:55:10,106 --> 00:55:11,471
Look at her books.

765
00:55:12,509 --> 00:55:14,170
Look at her sweater.

766
00:55:15,378 --> 00:55:18,677
Going up to that lake
all the time is one thing...

767
00:55:18,715 --> 00:55:20,683
but now they're going
to a library?

768
00:55:20,717 --> 00:55:23,185
What's next?

769
00:55:25,455 --> 00:55:26,786
You're right.

770
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:29,917
Somebody ought
to do something about that.

771
00:55:35,932 --> 00:55:37,866
Soon.

772
00:55:44,074 --> 00:55:46,065
You're probably wondering...

773
00:55:46,109 --> 00:55:49,044
why I asked to stop by
and see you today.

774
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:52,014
I'm sure you've noticed
the same things we all have.

775
00:55:52,048 --> 00:55:55,916
Certain changes in the town.

776
00:55:55,952 --> 00:55:59,388
You know what I mean by changes?

777
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:01,952
Changes.

778
00:56:01,991 --> 00:56:03,925
Changes.

779
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:07,726
And I'm not just talking
about big stuff like the fire.

780
00:56:07,764 --> 00:56:10,426
It's the little things.
Did you hear about Bill Miller?

781
00:56:10,467 --> 00:56:11,798
No. What?

782
00:56:11,835 --> 00:56:14,133
Wife wants him
to get one of those new beds.

783
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:17,003
One of those big beds?

784
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:21,067
Oh, my gosh. What's he gonna do?

785
00:56:21,111 --> 00:56:23,170
I don't know. It's everywhere.

786
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:25,681
Bill Anderson's boy
just quit his job at the market.

787
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:27,046
Quit?

788
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:29,483
Just took his apron off right in
the middle of an order...

789
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:31,544
said,
"l don't feel like it anymore."

790
00:56:31,588 --> 00:56:33,579
Groceries all over the counter.

791
00:56:33,623 --> 00:56:36,057
Took 'em three hours
just to sort it out.

792
00:56:38,328 --> 00:56:42,094
Everybody
really likes you, George.

793
00:56:42,132 --> 00:56:44,692
-Well...
-No, they do.

794
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:47,635
Not just 'cause you're a good
bowler. People respect you.

795
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:49,695
Well, thank you.

796
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:52,469
It's important for them to see
someone they respect...

797
00:56:52,509 --> 00:56:54,443
stand up for what's right.

798
00:56:54,477 --> 00:56:57,207
If you love a place,
you can't just sit back...

799
00:56:57,247 --> 00:57:00,512
and watch this kind of thing
happen, can you?

800
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:02,518
No, of course not.

801
00:57:02,552 --> 00:57:05,544
That is why I want you
to be a member...

802
00:57:05,588 --> 00:57:07,783
of the Pleasantville
Chamber of Commerce.

803
00:57:09,993 --> 00:57:12,427
Oh, my gosh.

804
00:57:13,696 --> 00:57:15,493
I hardly know what to say.

805
00:57:17,333 --> 00:57:19,233
It's just like yours.

806
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:22,329
It is exactly like mine, George.

807
00:57:25,642 --> 00:57:27,303
You can start by saying yes.

808
00:57:29,212 --> 00:57:32,147
And by getting me one of
those swell pineapple kabobs.

809
00:57:32,182 --> 00:57:34,013
Well, sure. You bet!
