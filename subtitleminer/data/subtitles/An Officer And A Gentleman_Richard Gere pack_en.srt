00:01:13,366 --> 00:01:17,536
Passengers arriving
on Philippine Airlines flight 118,

2
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:20,623
welcome to Manila
International Airport.

3
00:01:27,672 --> 00:01:29,131
Hey.

4
00:01:36,222 --> 00:01:37,515
Hey, kid!

5
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:40,142
- Are you Zack?
- Yes, sir.

6
00:01:40,226 --> 00:01:42,269
I'm Byron. Nice to meet you.

7
00:01:44,647 --> 00:01:47,858
- Come on, let's get your bags, OK?
- Yes, sir.

8
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:56,409
Take your jacket off, kid.
It's hot here.

9
00:01:56,492 --> 00:01:59,745
This is the PI,
the Philippine Islands.

10
00:02:00,705 --> 00:02:04,125
Zack, I'm sorry about
what happened to your mom.

11
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:06,502
It must have been pretty rough.

12
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:12,466
I would have called you a lot sooner,
but I was out at sea.

13
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:15,636
I've been calling you
for four months.

14
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:22,601
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
I was out at sea for four months.

15
00:02:38,034 --> 00:02:41,996
All right, kid. These are
your mama-sans, Tiki and Maria.

16
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:44,040
Hello, Byron.

17
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:48,753
I want you to meet somebody.

18
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:52,006
This is my son, Zack.
Tiki, say hello.

19
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:53,799
Zack - Tiki and Maria.

20
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:56,052
- Hi, Zack.
- Hi, Zack.

21
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,146
I'm at sea three weeks
of every month.

22
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:09,023
When I'm back in port,

23
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:12,360
I don't have time
for this daddy stuff.

24
00:03:12,443 --> 00:03:13,652
That's OK, sir.

25
00:03:13,736 --> 00:03:16,989
You don't understand.
I'm too old for this.

26
00:03:17,073 --> 00:03:21,452
I don't care what the Navy says.
This is no place for kids.

27
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:25,122
Like I said on the telephone,
you're better off in Virginia.

28
00:03:25,206 --> 00:03:28,959
- I'm never going back!
- Maybe that's not for you to say!

29
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:32,129
God dammit!
Don't look at me that way!

30
00:03:32,213 --> 00:03:35,174
What happened to your mother
had nothing to do with me.

31
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:37,843
It did! You said you'd come back!
You promised!

32
00:03:37,927 --> 00:03:42,056
That's what she said?
That's a female lie. That's bullshit!

33
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:46,185
I found your letters
and read them after she did it!

34
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:50,398
You said you loved her,
and she believed you!

35
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:52,316
You're a liar!

36
00:04:21,262 --> 00:04:24,932
Hurry, grow up, boy.
I'll wait for you. Cherry boy.

37
00:04:25,016 --> 00:04:29,020
You want to go to school?
I'll teach you nice.

38
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,607
Chicken feet, monkey meat.
Come on, you buy.

39
00:04:33,691 --> 00:04:36,527
You buy. Monkey meat. You buy.

40
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:40,197
Hey, sailor. What ship are you from?

41
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:23,074
Hey! What are you doing?

42
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:25,618
Big spender, give us some money.

43
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:28,204
- I don't have any.
- Get it out!

44
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:29,538
No!

45
00:05:33,084 --> 00:05:34,877
Leave me alone!

46
00:05:38,214 --> 00:05:39,882
Leave me alone.

47
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:59,694
Holy shit.

48
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:04,365
Watch it. I got to heave.

49
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:06,492
Jesus Christ.

50
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:18,713
Give me a towel.

51
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:30,641
Pretty fuckin' wild.

52
00:06:31,267 --> 00:06:33,352
Holy shit.

53
00:06:34,854 --> 00:06:39,233
Not as wild as that night we banged
those three stewardesses in Manila.

54
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:44,030
Bet you didn't get it on like that
in that jerkwater college of yours.

55
00:06:53,164 --> 00:06:56,042
How long you going to
hang around Seattle?

56
00:06:57,835 --> 00:07:01,630
Get ready.
This one will blow you away.

57
00:07:01,714 --> 00:07:05,009
Nothing you do
is ever going to surprise me.

58
00:07:06,135 --> 00:07:09,597
- Tell me.
- I joined the Navy.

59
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:13,684
- You joined the Navy?
- That's right, I did.

60
00:07:14,894 --> 00:07:17,772
I'm on my way to Port Rainier,

61
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:20,566
this officer's training school
over there.

62
00:07:21,734 --> 00:07:26,197
- What for?
- Jets. I want to fly jets.

63
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:30,826
This place is only
a couple of hours from here.

64
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:34,205
Maybe you'll want to
visit me sometime, right?

65
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:39,126
- Who put that idea in your head?
- Nobody. Just come to me.

66
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:41,671
What's so funny?

67
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:46,592
You, man. It's like saying
you're running for president.

68
00:07:48,636 --> 00:07:50,846
Christ, look at yourself.

69
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:54,767
Officers don't have tattoos.

70
00:07:58,187 --> 00:08:01,524
- Look, I'll see you, man, all right?
- Yeah.

71
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:06,612
- Zack, come on, don't be pissed off.
- I'm not pissed off.

72
00:08:06,696 --> 00:08:09,740
You are pissed off. I'm on your side.

73
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:14,203
I don't want to see you do
something you'll regret.

74
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:19,625
You got to give up six fucking years
of your life if you want to fly.

75
00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:24,714
Six fucking years, with the most
uptight assholes on earth.

76
00:08:24,797 --> 00:08:29,051
Officers aren't like you and me.
They're a different breed.

77
00:08:29,135 --> 00:08:33,764
This sounds like you're afraid
you might have to salute me someday.

78
00:08:33,848 --> 00:08:36,600
Why would I be afraid to salute you?

79
00:08:36,684 --> 00:08:39,020
I don't know. It sounds that way.

80
00:08:39,103 --> 00:08:42,398
You want some fatherly bullshit -
a pat on the back.

81
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:44,775
From you? No. No.

82
00:08:46,652 --> 00:08:50,823
Thanks for my graduation present,
Byron. See you around.

83
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:54,785
Don't go away mad.
Hey, babe. Zack! Come on.

84
00:08:55,953 --> 00:08:57,663
Zack!

85
00:11:04,457 --> 00:11:06,083
Fall in!

86
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:09,337
I said fall in, you slimy worms!

87
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:12,256
Put your toes on that chalk line!

88
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:17,803
I said put your toes on the
chalk line, you slimy worms!

89
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:27,980
I don't believe what I'm seeing.

90
00:11:28,064 --> 00:11:31,650
Where you been all your lives,
at an orgy?

91
00:11:31,734 --> 00:11:35,946
Listening to Mick Jagger music and
bad-mouthing your country, I'll bet.

92
00:11:38,616 --> 00:11:43,287
Stop eyeballing me. You're not worthy
to look your superiors in the eye.

93
00:11:43,371 --> 00:11:46,540
Use your peripheral vision.
Understand?

94
00:11:46,624 --> 00:11:47,708
Yes, sir.

95
00:11:47,792 --> 00:11:51,754
When I say "understand",
I want the group to say, "Yes, sir!"

96
00:11:51,837 --> 00:11:53,506
- Understand?
- Yes, sir!

97
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:55,800
- Understand?
- Yes, sir!

98
00:11:55,883 --> 00:11:58,969
I know why most of you are here.

99
00:12:00,054 --> 00:12:01,972
I'm not stupid.

100
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:07,103
Before you get to sell what we teach
you over at United Airlines,

101
00:12:07,186 --> 00:12:11,232
got to give the Navy six years
of your life, sweet pea.

102
00:12:11,315 --> 00:12:16,862
Lots of things can happen in six
years. Another war could come up.

103
00:12:16,946 --> 00:12:20,950
If you're too peaceful a person
to napalm an enemy village,

104
00:12:21,033 --> 00:12:25,621
where there are women and children,
I'm going to find that out.

105
00:12:25,705 --> 00:12:27,540
- Understand?
- Yes, sir!

106
00:12:27,623 --> 00:12:30,209
- Understand?
- Yes, sir!

107
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:33,546
Hi, son.

108
00:12:34,296 --> 00:12:36,841
How you doing, sarge?

109
00:12:36,924 --> 00:12:40,469
- What did you call me?
- Beg your pardon?

110
00:12:40,553 --> 00:12:42,680
What did you call me, boy?

111
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:44,640
- Sarge.
- Before that.

112
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:47,143
Nothing before that.

113
00:12:47,226 --> 00:12:51,647
You said, "How are you?"
A ewe is a female sheep.

114
00:12:51,731 --> 00:12:55,026
- Is that what you think I am, boy?
- No.

115
00:12:55,109 --> 00:12:56,819
- No, sir!
- No, sir.

116
00:12:56,902 --> 00:12:58,863
- Louder, sweet pea!
- No, sir!

117
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:04,243
You want to fuck me?
That's why you called me a ewe?

118
00:13:04,326 --> 00:13:07,955
- Are you a queer?
- Hell no, sir!

119
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:11,375
- Where you from, boy?
- Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, sir.

120
00:13:13,127 --> 00:13:16,088
Only two things come out of Oklahoma.

121
00:13:16,172 --> 00:13:18,841
Steers and queers.

122
00:13:19,842 --> 00:13:21,844
Which one are you, boy?

123
00:13:23,429 --> 00:13:26,682
I don't see no horns.
You must be a queer.

124
00:13:26,766 --> 00:13:27,767
No, sir.

125
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,478
Stop whispering.
You're giving me a hard-on.

126
00:13:30,561 --> 00:13:32,063
No, sir!

127
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:43,074
You laughing at me, dickbrain?

128
00:13:43,908 --> 00:13:45,284
No, sir!

129
00:13:45,368 --> 00:13:47,870
Stop eyeballing me,

130
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:51,582
or I'll rip your eyeballs out
and skullfuck you to death.

131
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:52,667
Yes, sir!

132
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,585
What's your name, boy?

133
00:13:54,669 --> 00:13:57,505
Mayo. Zack Mayo, sir!

134
00:13:57,588 --> 00:13:59,882
How did you slip into this programme?

135
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:02,927
I didn't know the Navy
was so hard up.

136
00:14:09,392 --> 00:14:11,727
You got an injury there, Mayo?

137
00:14:12,687 --> 00:14:14,522
Not exactly, sir.

138
00:14:18,526 --> 00:14:22,947
Hey, this is really wonderful work.
Where did you get this, Mayo?

139
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:25,574
Subic Base, Philippines, sir.

140
00:14:25,658 --> 00:14:28,244
Thought I recognised the work.

141
00:14:30,997 --> 00:14:32,873
Be proud of them wings.

142
00:14:32,957 --> 00:14:37,878
They're the only ones you're going to
leave here with, Mayo-nnaise!

143
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:54,562
- What's your name, boy?
- Emiliano Santos Della Serra, sir.

144
00:14:54,645 --> 00:14:58,357
You don't say?
You a college boy, Della Serra?

145
00:14:58,441 --> 00:15:00,693
Yes, sir! Math major, sir.

146
00:15:00,776 --> 00:15:03,195
Graduated from Texas tech
with honours, sir!

147
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:04,822
I see.

148
00:15:05,865 --> 00:15:08,409
You see this cane, Della Serra?

149
00:15:08,492 --> 00:15:10,703
See the notches near the handle?

150
00:15:10,786 --> 00:15:15,416
There's a notch for every college
puke like you that I got to DOR.

151
00:15:15,499 --> 00:15:18,169
That's Drop On Request
from this program.

152
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:23,924
The first one I'm going to call
out of this class is you, Emiliano.

153
00:15:24,008 --> 00:15:27,845
I expect to lose half of you
before I'm finished.

154
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:31,474
I will use every means
necessary, fair and unfair,

155
00:15:31,557 --> 00:15:35,853
to trip you up, to expose your
weaknesses as a potential aviator

156
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:38,022
and as a human being, understand?

157
00:15:38,105 --> 00:15:39,732
Yes, sir!

158
00:15:39,815 --> 00:15:45,321
The price at the other end is
a flight education worth $1 million!

159
00:15:45,404 --> 00:15:48,199
But first, you got to get past me!

160
00:15:56,332 --> 00:15:59,001
Hey, Paula! It's 5:00!

161
00:15:59,085 --> 00:16:01,629
Where's the goddamn whistle?

162
00:16:04,548 --> 00:16:07,051
Oh, shit!

163
00:16:09,887 --> 00:16:12,515
Come on, Paula.
Let's go! Turn that thing off!

164
00:16:13,641 --> 00:16:15,101
Next!

165
00:16:15,935 --> 00:16:17,812
Oh, shit.

166
00:16:18,896 --> 00:16:20,398
What is that?

167
00:16:22,858 --> 00:16:26,779
This is my idea of an ass bandit.

168
00:16:26,862 --> 00:16:30,241
Wait till the girls see you,
scrotumhead.

169
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:31,909
Scrotumhead!

170
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:34,245
Think that's funny, don't you, boy?

171
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:38,708
Not all the obstacles that can trip
you up are on this base.

172
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:41,836
Let me tell you something
about the local girls.

173
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:44,296
Ever since there's been a base here,

174
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:47,425
there's been what you'd call
the Puget Sound Debs.

175
00:16:47,508 --> 00:16:51,887
The poor girls come across
the sound on the ferry every weekend

176
00:16:51,971 --> 00:16:54,598
with just one thing in mind,

177
00:16:54,682 --> 00:16:59,437
and that's to marry themselves
a naval aviator.

178
00:17:11,323 --> 00:17:13,701
A Puget Deb will tell you,

179
00:17:13,784 --> 00:17:15,578
"Don't you worry
about contraceptives.

180
00:17:15,661 --> 00:17:18,205
"I've got that all taken care of."

181
00:17:18,289 --> 00:17:20,666
Don't believe it, sweet pea.

182
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:24,962
A Puget Deb will do anything
and say anything to trap you.

183
00:17:25,046 --> 00:17:27,298
I know this sounds silly,

184
00:17:27,381 --> 00:17:30,468
especially in this
so-called modern age,

185
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:34,805
but you scuzzy college pukes should
watch out, because they're out there,

186
00:17:34,889 --> 00:17:38,142
and you, sweet peas,
are the answer to their dream!

187
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:57,912
Hurry up! On the double!

188
00:17:57,995 --> 00:18:00,915
You lard asses, I'm going to fix you!

189
00:18:00,998 --> 00:18:02,416
Get up in there!

190
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,002
Quick! On the double, Mayonnaise!

191
00:18:05,086 --> 00:18:06,837
Come on, Seeger.

192
00:18:06,921 --> 00:18:10,216
Little girl poopies to the left,
boys to the right!

193
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:12,218
Come on, let's go!

194
00:18:13,177 --> 00:18:16,389
What a motley bunch! Get in there!

195
00:18:16,931 --> 00:18:20,017
All right, quick! On the double!

196
00:18:22,228 --> 00:18:25,648
OK, here we go.

197
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:32,071
How's it going?

198
00:18:33,114 --> 00:18:35,241
You got to be kidding.

199
00:18:35,324 --> 00:18:38,577
How do they expect me
to get down there?

200
00:18:38,661 --> 00:18:41,914
One of you guys want to switch bunks?

201
00:18:41,998 --> 00:18:45,501
- They're assigned bunks, man.
- I don't think we can.

202
00:18:45,584 --> 00:18:48,004
Hey, Daniels, you're in there.

203
00:18:50,256 --> 00:18:52,216
Who the hell is that guy?

204
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:55,720
That's your mom and dad
for the next 13 weeks.

205
00:18:55,803 --> 00:19:00,099
Fall out! Get outside!
On the double! Come on out here!

206
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:03,227
Quick! Out the door! On the double!

207
00:19:04,854 --> 00:19:07,606
Quick! Quick! Quick!

208
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:09,233
More! More! More! More!

209
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:10,735
Give me 50.

210
00:19:10,818 --> 00:19:12,903
Give me 50. Count them!

211
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,619
Think there's any truth to what he
said about those girls, Puget Debs?

212
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,996
- Sure.
- Still?

213
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:27,376
Yeah. Should have warned you scuzzy
female types about the Puget Dudes.

214
00:19:28,461 --> 00:19:32,923
They say they're wearing rubbers, but
there's a hole bitten in the bottom.

215
00:19:33,007 --> 00:19:34,091
Very funny, Mayo...

216
00:19:34,175 --> 00:19:37,887
Seeger, Mayo, Worley!
Got enough energy to run them sewers,

217
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:42,767
get over there and give me 50!
On the double! Right now!

218
00:19:44,894 --> 00:19:48,314
All right, poopie asses,
get your faces on down there!

219
00:19:48,397 --> 00:19:52,026
You women better not expect
special privileges!

220
00:19:52,109 --> 00:19:57,114
You think flying a plane is just
sitting on a chair pushing buttons?

221
00:19:57,198 --> 00:20:00,660
Looks like you need a little
upper-body strength, Seeger!

222
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:08,167
All right, all right, get up.

223
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,377
Get up!

224
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:11,045
Step out!

225
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:16,967
Get back in line! You watch!

226
00:20:18,094 --> 00:20:21,764
Pilots off the Lexington should be
getting to the Officers Club now.

227
00:20:21,847 --> 00:20:24,266
You sure got the timetable down,
Lynette.

228
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:27,144
After three years,
you learn all the tricks.

229
00:20:27,228 --> 00:20:30,064
Did you see
that bodacious set of tatas?

230
00:20:30,147 --> 00:20:33,359
I brought the records
the social committee asked for.

231
00:20:33,484 --> 00:20:36,237
You didn't come all this way...

232
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,407
You're pissing me off, boys!

233
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:40,658
38...

234
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:41,867
39...

235
00:20:41,951 --> 00:20:46,205
The Blue Angels will be in soon.
I'll introduce you if you like.

236
00:20:46,288 --> 00:20:48,582
- Bye for now.
- Bye, bye.

237
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:51,252
Far fucking out!

238
00:20:51,335 --> 00:20:54,839
I've been wanting to meet
one of those Blue Angels!

239
00:20:54,922 --> 00:20:57,675
Look at those poopies.
Those poor guys.

240
00:20:57,758 --> 00:20:59,844
See you when you get liberty!

241
00:20:59,927 --> 00:21:02,638
It grows out about an inch by then!

242
00:21:02,722 --> 00:21:07,226
Ain't gonna be no liberty for you.
You'll be going home before then.

243
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:08,894
Start from one again!

244
00:21:08,978 --> 00:21:10,312
1...

245
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:11,981
2...

246
00:21:13,649 --> 00:21:16,318
Flyin' low and feelin' mean!

247
00:21:19,613 --> 00:21:22,575
Spot a family by the stream!

248
00:21:25,828 --> 00:21:28,789
Pickle a pair and hear 'em scream!

249
00:21:31,709 --> 00:21:34,295
Cos napalm sticks to kids!

250
00:21:36,964 --> 00:21:40,051
- That's disgusting!
- What are you doing here?

251
00:21:40,134 --> 00:21:41,927
Am I threatening you?

252
00:21:42,011 --> 00:21:45,264
Send you to war,
you'll get your ass shot down.

253
00:21:45,348 --> 00:21:48,976
Wouldn't mind being the first woman
to fly fighters in combat.

254
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:51,645
- Go in my place. Jets?
- All the way.

255
00:21:51,729 --> 00:21:54,023
- Mayo?
- Jets.

256
00:21:54,106 --> 00:21:58,444
Only two go to jets.
Who's going with me?

257
00:21:58,527 --> 00:21:59,820
- Me!
- Me!

258
00:21:59,904 --> 00:22:02,073
Talking in the ranks again.

259
00:22:02,156 --> 00:22:06,369
You three just added 2 miles
to this little hike...for everybody.

260
00:22:06,452 --> 00:22:07,995
Come on! Let's go!

261
00:22:08,788 --> 00:22:11,457
Family of gooks
are sittin' in a ditch!

262
00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:17,963
Little baby suckin'
on his mama's tit!

263
00:22:20,883 --> 00:22:24,303
Chemical firms don't give a shit!

264
00:22:27,098 --> 00:22:30,059
That napalm sticks to kids!

265
00:22:32,937 --> 00:22:35,564
Get up here! Up those stairs!

266
00:22:36,524 --> 00:22:38,442
Let's go! Come on!

267
00:22:42,947 --> 00:22:44,657
Move, move, move!

268
00:22:47,743 --> 00:22:49,870
Move it up here!

269
00:22:49,954 --> 00:22:52,915
Come on, let's go!

270
00:22:52,999 --> 00:22:54,875
Come on, let's go! Go!

271
00:22:54,959 --> 00:22:57,003
Get up here! Move!

272
00:22:57,086 --> 00:22:58,587
Get up here!

273
00:22:58,671 --> 00:23:00,965
Move it, candy pants!

274
00:23:01,048 --> 00:23:04,552
Double it up! Double it up! Move on!

275
00:23:13,894 --> 00:23:17,356
All right, everybody, up!
Up on your feet!

276
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,777
I don't want to see nothing
coming out your mouths either!

277
00:23:21,861 --> 00:23:25,448
Let's get in shape around here!
Stand straight up!

278
00:23:27,074 --> 00:23:29,368
Get out of the way!

279
00:23:29,452 --> 00:23:32,330
Lift your head and hold it high!

280
00:23:35,249 --> 00:23:38,169
The best in the regiment
is runnin' on by!

281
00:23:45,384 --> 00:23:49,597
That could be you at the end of
13 weeks... Those who might survive!

282
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,975
You don't deserve to look at them!

283
00:23:53,059 --> 00:23:55,061
Della Serra, turn you back!

284
00:23:55,144 --> 00:23:57,313
You are without a doubt

285
00:23:57,396 --> 00:24:00,483
the most pathetic class
I've ever been assigned to!

286
00:24:02,485 --> 00:24:06,614
You big chump. Four weeks, and you
still can't shine a damn buckle.

287
00:24:06,697 --> 00:24:08,699
Shoot me a Kotex, buddy.

288
00:24:10,242 --> 00:24:12,703
Be careful where you stick that.

289
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:21,003
- Five minutes to inspection, Mayo.
- Where's your money?

290
00:24:31,889 --> 00:24:33,182
Boonies.

291
00:24:34,725 --> 00:24:38,521
You better hope Foley
never finds out about that.

292
00:24:39,397 --> 00:24:41,232
Hey, Perryman.

293
00:24:42,483 --> 00:24:44,610
Look what I got here, man.

294
00:24:47,947 --> 00:24:51,534
Look at that. Look at them buckles.

295
00:24:51,617 --> 00:24:53,327
Look good, huh?

296
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,539
10 bucks. 15 for the boonies.

297
00:24:56,622 --> 00:24:58,749
Who's got 10 bucks?

298
00:24:58,833 --> 00:25:03,421
I spend every penny keeping
my old lady and kid in that motel.

299
00:25:03,504 --> 00:25:05,423
You're breaking my heart, Perryman.

300
00:25:05,506 --> 00:25:08,009
Who's doing this for you?

301
00:25:10,052 --> 00:25:11,887
Some enlisted guy, right?

302
00:25:14,724 --> 00:25:18,519
- Hey, tell me something.
- Watch the sheets, man.

303
00:25:18,602 --> 00:25:21,772
Is that piss-ass piece of change
you're making

304
00:25:21,856 --> 00:25:26,360
worth all of us getting kicked out
of here on an honours violation?

305
00:25:27,445 --> 00:25:30,448
I don't see anybody else
complaining about it, Perryman.

306
00:25:30,531 --> 00:25:32,033
Excuse me.

307
00:25:32,616 --> 00:25:34,493
Ready? Go!

308
00:26:02,897 --> 00:26:04,815
Look out, Worley, coming through.

309
00:26:04,899 --> 00:26:07,943
- The hell you say, son.
- Here I come.

310
00:26:10,154 --> 00:26:13,157
I'm putting my name on that wall.

311
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,784
Underneath mine.

312
00:26:14,867 --> 00:26:15,993
Fuck!

313
00:26:25,169 --> 00:26:27,004
Give me the rope!

314
00:26:28,714 --> 00:26:30,007
Shit!

315
00:26:35,721 --> 00:26:37,515
God damn, Mayonnaise!

316
00:26:49,026 --> 00:26:52,196
2:25. Not bad...for a beginner.

317
00:26:52,697 --> 00:26:54,490
Piece of cake.

318
00:26:54,573 --> 00:26:56,993
Let's go! Come on, Schneider!

319
00:26:57,076 --> 00:26:58,327
Come on, Schneider!

320
00:26:59,495 --> 00:27:01,080
Let's go! Let's go!

321
00:27:01,163 --> 00:27:03,416
Let's go! Let's go!

322
00:27:03,499 --> 00:27:05,167
Kick ass!

323
00:27:18,639 --> 00:27:21,767
Let's go!
You guys are bringing up the rear!

324
00:27:23,811 --> 00:27:28,649
You ain't getting out of here
till you get over that wall, Seeger!

325
00:27:28,733 --> 00:27:31,235
- I'll make it, sir!
- Hurry up!

326
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:35,323
Come on. Get over there!

327
00:27:36,949 --> 00:27:39,910
You really want to be a man, Seeger?

328
00:27:39,994 --> 00:27:43,789
You one of those girls didn't
get enough of daddy's attention

329
00:27:43,873 --> 00:27:47,376
cos he really wanted a son, Seeger?

330
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:51,630
That's it. That's what'll
beat you every time, Seeger -

331
00:27:51,714 --> 00:27:54,759
your mental attitude
is that of a female.

332
00:27:54,842 --> 00:27:57,219
Deep down under all that bullshit

333
00:27:57,303 --> 00:28:01,891
you're still thinking like
a second-class citizen, aren't you?

334
00:28:01,974 --> 00:28:04,602
You can never give orders to men!

335
00:28:04,685 --> 00:28:06,687
Walk around.

336
00:28:06,771 --> 00:28:09,857
Walk around, sugar britches.

337
00:28:11,025 --> 00:28:14,403
Bernoulli's equation gives us
the total amount of energy

338
00:28:14,487 --> 00:28:16,113
contained in the air flow.

339
00:28:16,197 --> 00:28:20,076
"P" is static pressure
in pounds per square foot.

340
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,788
"RHO" is air density
in slugs per cubic foot,

341
00:28:23,871 --> 00:28:27,333
and velocity is in feet per second.

342
00:28:27,416 --> 00:28:30,086
2,000 pounds per square foot...

343
00:28:49,105 --> 00:28:52,024
Let's see them.

344
00:28:52,108 --> 00:28:54,151
What about the buckles?

345
00:28:57,363 --> 00:29:00,449
OK. All right. 20 bucks, right?

346
00:29:02,034 --> 00:29:03,411
Hey, bud.

347
00:29:05,371 --> 00:29:06,831
Beat it.

348
00:29:08,332 --> 00:29:10,167
What are you laughing about?

349
00:29:10,251 --> 00:29:13,462
- I thought that's how you did it.
- Did what?

350
00:29:13,546 --> 00:29:15,923
Come on, Santy Claus.

351
00:29:16,757 --> 00:29:18,843
You won't tell anybody, will you?

352
00:29:18,926 --> 00:29:23,431
Not if you make it worth my while.
Free boonies for the duration.

353
00:29:23,514 --> 00:29:25,349
That's fair.

354
00:29:26,183 --> 00:29:29,854
Tell you what...
you get me through aerodynamics,

355
00:29:29,937 --> 00:29:32,982
you can write your own ticket,
my friend.

356
00:29:36,277 --> 00:29:37,945
You got a deal.

357
00:30:11,187 --> 00:30:14,273
George Jones, where are you
when we need you most?

358
00:30:23,407 --> 00:30:26,285
Hey, 2:00. Moving in. Della Serra.

359
00:30:27,536 --> 00:30:30,164
Radar's up. Scoping the target area.

360
00:30:33,167 --> 00:30:36,212
Zero in. Slick it back.

361
00:30:37,171 --> 00:30:40,883
Who'll be the lucky Deb?
Is it the blonde? The brunette?

362
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,595
Score! He got her.

363
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:47,682
My God, check Perryman.

364
00:30:47,765 --> 00:30:50,559
Five years of marriage,
still in love.

365
00:30:50,643 --> 00:30:52,395
That's what life's all about.

366
00:30:57,233 --> 00:30:59,193
Hey, Seeger!

367
00:31:03,656 --> 00:31:07,118
Remember those bodacious tatas
and her pal?

368
00:31:07,201 --> 00:31:09,745
Right there they are, bud.

369
00:31:11,122 --> 00:31:13,749
We ought to do something about it.

370
00:31:20,089 --> 00:31:25,970
Captain Graves, so nice to meet you.
The boys speak so highly of you.

371
00:31:26,053 --> 00:31:28,597
Lynette,
he has several people to meet.

372
00:31:28,681 --> 00:31:31,517
- I'm so sorry.
- Captain Rufferwell.

373
00:31:33,644 --> 00:31:34,854
Mrs Rufferwell!

374
00:31:34,937 --> 00:31:36,105
Hello, Captain.

375
00:31:37,898 --> 00:31:40,568
How are you? Nice to meet you.

376
00:31:40,651 --> 00:31:44,655
Could you introduce us
to these two young ladies, please?

377
00:31:44,739 --> 00:31:46,198
Paula, Lynette.

378
00:31:48,034 --> 00:31:49,452
Miss Paula Pokrifki,

379
00:31:49,535 --> 00:31:51,329
Miss Lynette Pomeroy,

380
00:31:51,412 --> 00:31:54,623
may I present
Officer Candidate Sid Worley

381
00:31:54,707 --> 00:31:57,168
and Officer Candidate Zachary Mayo.

382
00:31:58,753 --> 00:32:00,838
Well, I hope you have a good time.

383
00:32:03,549 --> 00:32:04,925
We already met.

384
00:32:05,009 --> 00:32:06,135
We did?

385
00:32:08,471 --> 00:32:11,432
You said it would
grow an inch by now.

386
00:32:12,516 --> 00:32:15,603
- That was you guys?
- Yeah.

387
00:32:20,232 --> 00:32:22,109
Would you like to dance?

388
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,861
Sure.

389
00:32:25,571 --> 00:32:28,658
It's grown out
more than an inch, pal.

390
00:32:41,128 --> 00:32:43,506
Would you like to get a drink?

391
00:32:43,589 --> 00:32:45,091
Sure.

392
00:32:45,174 --> 00:32:46,759
Let's go.

393
00:32:50,888 --> 00:32:53,557
What kind of a name is Pokrifki?

394
00:32:53,641 --> 00:32:56,811
Polish. What kind of a name is Mayo?

395
00:32:56,894 --> 00:32:59,271
Italian. My mom was Irish.

396
00:32:59,355 --> 00:33:00,815
No, thank you.

397
00:33:00,898 --> 00:33:03,442
I think I got her ears.

398
00:33:03,526 --> 00:33:05,486
The rest is all wop.

399
00:33:05,569 --> 00:33:07,947
Where are you from, Mayo the wop?

400
00:33:08,906 --> 00:33:10,950
Everywhere, nowhere...

401
00:33:11,367 --> 00:33:12,952
Paula the Polack.

402
00:33:13,869 --> 00:33:15,287
Seriously.

403
00:33:15,371 --> 00:33:18,040
Seriously. Seriously...

404
00:33:18,124 --> 00:33:21,210
My father's a rear admiral,
seventh fleet.

405
00:33:21,293 --> 00:33:22,837
You're kidding.

406
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,881
We lived in ports
all over the world...

407
00:33:25,965 --> 00:33:30,803
- Kathmandu...Moscow, Nairobi.
- Really?

408
00:33:30,886 --> 00:33:33,222
I've never been out of Washington.

409
00:33:35,057 --> 00:33:37,518
Wait a minute.
You're kidding me, right?

410
00:33:38,811 --> 00:33:41,981
We don't have any
naval bases in Moscow.

411
00:33:42,064 --> 00:33:45,192
- No.
- No. I didn't think so.

412
00:33:46,861 --> 00:33:50,323
So...you got a girl, Mayo the wop?

413
00:33:51,741 --> 00:33:53,284
No.

414
00:33:54,785 --> 00:33:57,038
I ain't looking for one either.

415
00:33:59,206 --> 00:34:01,667
What are you looking for?

416
00:34:07,048 --> 00:34:11,802
I've heard about these girls who
come here looking for a husband.

417
00:34:11,886 --> 00:34:16,932
- Not me.
- Yeah? Why are you here?

418
00:34:17,016 --> 00:34:20,811
To meet interesting people,
improve myself.

419
00:34:22,396 --> 00:34:24,815
What do you do, go to school?

420
00:34:24,899 --> 00:34:26,776
No, I got a job.

421
00:34:26,859 --> 00:34:30,905
I work over at National Paper.
It's a real good job.

422
00:34:30,988 --> 00:34:33,783
I'm going to save
enough money, travel.

423
00:34:33,866 --> 00:34:36,869
Think I'd like to go to Moscow.

424
00:34:42,208 --> 00:34:44,835
You been through
the Dilbert Dunker yet?

425
00:34:44,919 --> 00:34:48,089
No, but my father and brother
made it through.

426
00:34:48,172 --> 00:34:50,341
I guess I can, too.

427
00:34:50,424 --> 00:34:52,677
Is your brother a flier?

428
00:34:53,803 --> 00:34:56,597
He was. He got killed.

429
00:34:56,681 --> 00:34:59,558
- Vietnam?
- Yeah.

430
00:35:00,726 --> 00:35:03,312
My brother died over there, too.

431
00:35:03,396 --> 00:35:05,523
He wasn't a flier though.

432
00:35:06,857 --> 00:35:09,694
I was only 12 when it happened.

433
00:35:09,777 --> 00:35:12,154
I don't remember
that much about him.

434
00:35:14,031 --> 00:35:16,242
I sure remember Tommy.

435
00:35:17,284 --> 00:35:19,620
Mind if we talk
about something else?

436
00:35:22,039 --> 00:35:25,418
We don't have to talk
about anything at all.

437
00:36:03,789 --> 00:36:07,251
Do you think you'll make it
to getting your wings?

438
00:36:07,335 --> 00:36:12,298
Who knows? Guys a lot smarter than me
been dropping out like flies.

439
00:36:12,381 --> 00:36:15,384
You got to say you're going to do it.

440
00:36:15,468 --> 00:36:18,596
Got to programme yourself.
It'll happen.

441
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:21,349
You've just got to see
yourself making it.

442
00:36:21,432 --> 00:36:24,810
I read this article
in Cosmo about that.

443
00:36:25,853 --> 00:36:27,271
I swear.

444
00:36:29,315 --> 00:36:34,820
Paula...you are a very,
very pretty girl.

445
00:36:47,833 --> 00:36:50,628
Do you want to go somewhere else?

446
00:36:51,671 --> 00:36:52,838
Come on.

447
00:36:56,342 --> 00:36:57,802
Fall out, Worley.

448
00:37:10,106 --> 00:37:13,526
Something tells me you girls
have been here before.

449
00:37:13,609 --> 00:37:16,278
Whatever gave you that idea?

450
00:37:18,322 --> 00:37:21,909
Stop it! You're going to ruin it.

451
00:37:21,993 --> 00:37:23,244
I'm sorry.

452
00:37:23,327 --> 00:37:25,162
I'll do it.

453
00:37:31,669 --> 00:37:33,379
You sure this is OK?

454
00:37:34,505 --> 00:37:38,092
Don't worry.
I'll respect you in the morning.

455
00:37:39,343 --> 00:37:41,178
You're crazy, girl.

456
00:37:41,262 --> 00:37:43,305
You'll respect me!

457
00:37:53,899 --> 00:37:56,736
Couldn't wait to get out of there.

458
00:37:56,819 --> 00:38:00,740
- Didn't you like the band?
- Not much.

459
00:38:00,823 --> 00:38:03,242
You didn't like Tie a Yellow Ribbon?

460
00:38:03,326 --> 00:38:05,161
I thought their rendition's...

461
00:38:19,383 --> 00:38:21,761
Let's go down to the beach.

462
00:38:21,844 --> 00:38:23,721
That sounds good.

463
00:38:31,312 --> 00:38:33,147
Squad, halt!

464
00:38:34,065 --> 00:38:35,691
Fall out!

465
00:38:56,587 --> 00:38:59,215
Look at Foley. Do you believe it?

466
00:39:01,425 --> 00:39:02,802
Showboat.

467
00:39:02,885 --> 00:39:05,054
All right. Listen up.

468
00:39:05,137 --> 00:39:08,057
I'm the base martial arts instructor.

469
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:11,852
Those of you in 1-5
must desist thinking of me

470
00:39:11,936 --> 00:39:13,896
as the drill instructor for now.

471
00:39:13,979 --> 00:39:17,233
Just think of me...as the enemy.

472
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:19,860
Do you believe this guy?

473
00:39:19,944 --> 00:39:22,780
May I have a volunteer, please?

474
00:39:23,864 --> 00:39:24,865
Daniels.

475
00:39:24,949 --> 00:39:27,576
How about you? Get up here quick.

476
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,537
Put him in the hospital.

477
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:32,248
He can't touch me.
It's against the law.

478
00:39:32,331 --> 00:39:35,042
- Kick his ass.
- Come on, Topper!

479
00:39:35,126 --> 00:39:37,044
Come on up here, son.

480
00:39:37,962 --> 00:39:39,547
Hang tough, buddy!

481
00:39:42,466 --> 00:39:43,884
Hello, pussy.

482
00:39:44,802 --> 00:39:47,263
How bad do you want to survive?

483
00:39:47,346 --> 00:39:50,558
This Officer Candidate
doesn't understand the question, sir.

484
00:39:52,351 --> 00:39:55,062
Let's see
if I can clarify it a little bit.

485
00:39:59,275 --> 00:40:02,028
Want to survive
enough to stop me, pussy,

486
00:40:02,111 --> 00:40:05,781
or are you relying on my generosity,
my love of humanity,

487
00:40:05,865 --> 00:40:07,992
to stop me from killing you?

488
00:40:08,075 --> 00:40:09,368
I...breathe.

489
00:40:09,452 --> 00:40:11,370
Break loose.

490
00:40:11,954 --> 00:40:12,955
Break loose!

491
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:15,041
I...can't...breathe.

492
00:40:19,545 --> 00:40:21,505
Get away from here!

493
00:40:23,007 --> 00:40:26,010
You're not hurt.
I could have killed you.

494
00:40:26,093 --> 00:40:27,345
Move off.

495
00:40:28,637 --> 00:40:30,473
Get out of here!

496
00:40:30,556 --> 00:40:32,933
Hurry up. Get back to your seat!

497
00:40:35,311 --> 00:40:39,899
You think I was harsh
on your classmate, don't you?

498
00:40:39,982 --> 00:40:44,278
Wait until you get shot down
behind enemy lines somewhere,

499
00:40:44,362 --> 00:40:47,448
and the only thing
between you and a POW Camp

500
00:40:47,531 --> 00:40:49,909
is what you learn from me.

501
00:40:49,992 --> 00:40:51,994
Now that I got your attention,

502
00:40:52,078 --> 00:40:55,247
we shall proceed with the class.

503
00:41:15,893 --> 00:41:18,521
God, I hope she shows.

504
00:41:18,604 --> 00:41:21,190
She's going to show. She will show.

505
00:41:21,273 --> 00:41:25,653
A rich, socialite Okie like you
ought to be a big catch around here.

506
00:41:25,736 --> 00:41:27,154
Hey, I ain't rich.

507
00:41:27,238 --> 00:41:29,490
- You're an officer's kid.
- So what?

508
00:41:33,744 --> 00:41:35,955
Man, I spent six years

509
00:41:36,038 --> 00:41:39,875
living right on top of the
raunchiest whorehouse in the PI.

510
00:41:45,297 --> 00:41:47,717
"You want numbah one fucky-fucky?

511
00:41:50,428 --> 00:41:53,055
"Long time, short time.
$10! Cheap-cheap!"

512
00:41:53,139 --> 00:41:54,181
10 bucks?

513
00:41:54,265 --> 00:41:56,225
"10 dollah. 10 dollah!"

514
00:41:59,854 --> 00:42:02,565
Lynette, honey, how's it hanging?

515
00:42:02,648 --> 00:42:04,859
Don't drool on her, boy.

516
00:42:05,026 --> 00:42:06,986
- Hey, ladies.
- Hi.

517
00:42:12,074 --> 00:42:13,909
Pansy-ass flyboys.

518
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:22,752
I remember you. Mayo the wop.

519
00:42:23,836 --> 00:42:25,671
Yep, that's me.

520
00:42:28,132 --> 00:42:30,051
It's good to see you.

521
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:34,221
I was looking forward to it.

522
00:42:35,514 --> 00:42:38,100
- Me, too.
- Really?

523
00:42:38,184 --> 00:42:39,518
Yeah.

524
00:42:41,937 --> 00:42:43,356
Excuse me.

525
00:42:44,732 --> 00:42:49,695
You guys want to just hang out here,
or can I suggest an alternate plan?

526
00:42:50,446 --> 00:42:53,783
Like pick up a bottle
and go to the motel?

527
00:42:53,866 --> 00:42:55,701
Just like that, yeah.

528
00:42:56,952 --> 00:42:58,329
What do you think?

529
00:42:59,955 --> 00:43:02,124
I'll vote for a motel.

530
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:06,545
My kind of group.

531
00:43:10,341 --> 00:43:12,009
Troy, here they come.

532
00:43:16,555 --> 00:43:19,684
Well! Make way for the warmongers.

533
00:43:20,601 --> 00:43:22,478
What did you call us?

534
00:43:22,561 --> 00:43:26,065
I called you a warmonger.
Ain't that what you are?

535
00:43:26,148 --> 00:43:27,525
Yeah, right.

536
00:43:41,539 --> 00:43:43,833
I just want to ask you something.

537
00:43:43,916 --> 00:43:45,751
What do you want?

538
00:43:45,835 --> 00:43:51,674
You rich college boys come strutting
around in your ice cream outfits

539
00:43:51,757 --> 00:43:53,926
like you own the goddamned place.

540
00:43:54,760 --> 00:44:00,349
- I mean, who do you think you are?
- I don't want to fight you.

541
00:44:00,433 --> 00:44:04,437
I do not want to fight.
Go back inside and cool down.

542
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,605
I ain't finished talking, sailor boy!

543
00:44:07,815 --> 00:44:09,650
Get him, Troy.

544
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:17,158
Oh, God.

545
00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:21,370
Back off, man. That's enough, man.

546
00:44:21,454 --> 00:44:23,873
Holy shit! Check his nose!

547
00:44:27,668 --> 00:44:29,795
He broke his nose, man.

548
00:44:29,879 --> 00:44:32,256
- You asshole!
- Faggot!

549
00:44:33,424 --> 00:44:34,967
Come on, come on.

550
00:44:35,051 --> 00:44:39,180
God! I never seen anything
like that in my life.

551
00:44:39,263 --> 00:44:40,681
Did you see his nose?

552
00:44:40,765 --> 00:44:45,269
Lynette, will you just shut up
until we get to the motel? Please?

553
00:44:45,353 --> 00:44:47,730
Well, excuse me for living.

554
00:44:49,732 --> 00:44:51,400
Asshole!

555
00:44:53,819 --> 00:44:55,571
I should have walked away.

556
00:44:55,655 --> 00:44:58,449
Zack, he didn't give you a choice.

557
00:44:58,532 --> 00:45:01,035
A man's always got a choice.

558
00:45:12,922 --> 00:45:15,091
Where did you learn to fight?

559
00:45:15,174 --> 00:45:17,718
I don't want to talk about it.

560
00:45:17,802 --> 00:45:19,136
All right.

561
00:45:27,228 --> 00:45:31,190
It wouldn't kill you
to open up to me.

562
00:45:32,233 --> 00:45:35,277
What do you want? You want to fuck?

563
00:45:35,361 --> 00:45:40,282
Come here. Take your clothes off.
I'll give you a good fuck.

564
00:45:40,366 --> 00:45:41,826
Where's that coming from?

565
00:45:41,909 --> 00:45:44,954
- Get on the bed.
- I wouldn't fuck you now...

566
00:45:45,037 --> 00:45:47,206
Then get the hell out!

567
00:45:47,289 --> 00:45:49,625
Who do you think you're talking to?

568
00:45:49,709 --> 00:45:52,628
I'm not some whore
you brought in here.

569
00:45:52,712 --> 00:45:55,798
I'm trying to be your friend, Zack.

570
00:45:55,881 --> 00:45:58,592
Then be a friend. Get out of here.

571
00:45:58,676 --> 00:46:01,137
Fine. Fine.

572
00:46:02,596 --> 00:46:04,265
Man, you ain't nothing special.

573
00:46:04,348 --> 00:46:06,934
No manners.
You treat women like whores.

574
00:46:07,018 --> 00:46:11,230
If you ask me, you got no chance
of being no officer.

575
00:46:28,539 --> 00:46:29,874
It's OK.

576
00:46:29,957 --> 00:46:31,125
It's all right.

577
00:46:34,211 --> 00:46:35,713
I'm sorry.

578
00:46:38,132 --> 00:46:39,633
I'm sorry.

579
00:47:23,594 --> 00:47:27,014
- Are you hungry?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm starved.

580
00:47:37,024 --> 00:47:40,820
- Skivvies?
- Pretty sexy, huh?

581
00:47:41,946 --> 00:47:45,116
- Sporty.
- Control yourself, baby.

582
00:47:55,167 --> 00:47:56,627
Good!

583
00:48:08,264 --> 00:48:10,850
Look, Paula...

584
00:48:10,933 --> 00:48:16,897
I try real hard not to fool anybody
about who I am, what I want.

585
00:48:18,649 --> 00:48:21,902
I know who you are and what you want.

586
00:48:21,986 --> 00:48:24,447
And what do you want?

587
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:27,950
I want a good time until you leave.

588
00:48:28,993 --> 00:48:31,120
That's it?

589
00:48:37,126 --> 00:48:39,003
Hey!

590
00:48:39,086 --> 00:48:43,341
- Last night was incredible.
- I thought so, too.

591
00:48:46,552 --> 00:48:50,139
- Zack, am I your fantasy?
- What?

592
00:48:50,222 --> 00:48:52,266
I'm not getting serious on you.

593
00:48:52,350 --> 00:48:55,644
I dare you
not to fall in love with me.

594
00:48:55,728 --> 00:48:58,272
How can you resist? I'm like candy.

595
00:48:59,732 --> 00:49:01,817
You're better than candy.

596
00:49:01,901 --> 00:49:05,738
It's going to be hard
to get enough, very hard.

597
00:49:05,821 --> 00:49:07,323
Very hard!

598
00:49:07,406 --> 00:49:10,117
You're getting feisty on me,
you little polack.

599
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:12,244
You cocky polack!

600
00:49:27,301 --> 00:49:31,389
What do you do with a girl
when you're through with her?

601
00:49:31,472 --> 00:49:33,724
You say something or just disappear?

602
00:49:37,311 --> 00:49:39,313
I never had a girl.

603
00:49:48,364 --> 00:49:50,992
I forgot to thank you for breakfast.

604
00:49:51,075 --> 00:49:53,077
Any time, sailor.

605
00:49:58,958 --> 00:50:02,336
Heads up, Perryman.
When you hit the water,

606
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:06,549
you might get the wind
knocked out of you. Don't panic.

607
00:50:06,632 --> 00:50:08,509
You've got a second and a half

608
00:50:08,592 --> 00:50:12,179
before the cage is completely
underwater and upside down.

609
00:50:12,722 --> 00:50:14,557
Go, Joe!

610
00:50:22,106 --> 00:50:27,486
Now, the most important thing
is to watch your bubbles.

611
00:50:28,362 --> 00:50:31,449
When that cage flips upside down,
you'll be disoriented.

612
00:50:31,532 --> 00:50:35,161
You won't know what your bearings
are, like Perryman down there.

613
00:50:35,244 --> 00:50:38,622
The bubbles determine
which way is up.

614
00:50:40,166 --> 00:50:43,336
All right, time's up.
Go down for him.

615
00:50:43,878 --> 00:50:46,213
This is what happens if you panic.

616
00:50:46,297 --> 00:50:49,425
You can die there,
and this is a pool.

617
00:50:49,508 --> 00:50:53,929
Out in the pacific, you won't
have a frogman to save your ass.

618
00:51:00,186 --> 00:51:02,396
Totally unsatisfactory, Perryman.

619
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,690
Do it again.

620
00:51:05,399 --> 00:51:08,819
Two more chances to make it,
or you're out.

621
00:51:08,903 --> 00:51:10,488
All right. Next!

622
00:51:10,571 --> 00:51:12,698
Hold it. Change in order.

623
00:51:12,782 --> 00:51:17,995
Mayo...since you're hotshot
of the week, you're next.

624
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:19,497
Aye, aye, sir.

625
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:22,708
- Seeger, you're behind him.
- Yes, sir.

626
00:51:29,298 --> 00:51:33,552
You ought to be good at this, Mayo.
Something you can do alone.

627
00:51:33,636 --> 00:51:34,887
Take him up!

628
00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:38,224
You never know
when you'll trip up, Mayo.

629
00:51:39,475 --> 00:51:44,230
It could be some character flaw
that comes out under stress.

630
00:51:47,316 --> 00:51:48,734
Let's go, Joe!

631
00:52:10,131 --> 00:52:11,841
All right! Way to go!

632
00:52:11,924 --> 00:52:14,135
OK, Seeger. You're next.

633
00:52:14,218 --> 00:52:17,221
All right, Seeger, let's go.
Get a move on.

634
00:52:18,014 --> 00:52:19,765
Joe, take her up!

635
00:52:25,396 --> 00:52:27,690
Don't you cry, sugar britches!

636
00:52:28,441 --> 00:52:30,067
Go, Joe!

637
00:52:45,291 --> 00:52:47,335
All right, Seeger!

638
00:52:47,418 --> 00:52:48,961
All right.

639
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,429
Gosh, that was great!
Think they'd let us do it again?

640
00:53:01,057 --> 00:53:05,978
Not bad, Seeger. But you still
got to get over that wall.

641
00:53:08,522 --> 00:53:10,149
Next!

642
00:53:10,232 --> 00:53:11,859
Daniels, move it.

643
00:53:11,942 --> 00:53:13,903
It's just a joy ride.

644
00:53:20,743 --> 00:53:23,954
Does this hit with a plane's impact?

645
00:53:24,038 --> 00:53:26,165
It's nothing compared to a plane.

646
00:53:27,541 --> 00:53:29,627
Don't forget to watch the bubbles.

647
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:31,128
Take him up!

648
00:53:44,517 --> 00:53:47,770
All right, Daniels.
Let's have that thumbs up.

649
00:53:48,187 --> 00:53:51,190
Come on. Where's the thumbs up at?

650
00:53:52,525 --> 00:53:54,235
All right. Go, Joe!

651
00:54:16,716 --> 00:54:18,217
Take it easy.

652
00:54:34,275 --> 00:54:35,609
Pull it up!

653
00:54:35,735 --> 00:54:39,238
Can't get it!
It's gonna take a couple of seconds.

654
00:54:47,371 --> 00:54:48,998
Let me through!

655
00:54:56,213 --> 00:54:57,340
Grab him!

656
00:54:58,299 --> 00:55:00,009
All right. Pull him out!

657
00:55:00,843 --> 00:55:01,886
Hold him!

658
00:55:01,969 --> 00:55:04,597
Put him on his stomach!

659
00:55:05,723 --> 00:55:07,099
Take his helmet off!

660
00:55:07,183 --> 00:55:10,019
- God damn!
- Get it off.

661
00:55:10,102 --> 00:55:14,273
Christ! He killed himself.

662
00:55:14,357 --> 00:55:17,401
Somebody get me a corpsman.
On the double!

663
00:55:17,485 --> 00:55:18,569
Yes, sir!

664
00:55:19,487 --> 00:55:22,073
OK, everybody just stand back.

665
00:55:22,156 --> 00:55:23,407
Come on, Topper.

666
00:55:23,491 --> 00:55:25,618
- God!
- Come on.

667
00:55:25,701 --> 00:55:27,453
Come on, buddy.

668
00:55:30,748 --> 00:55:32,375
Come on, man.

669
00:55:32,458 --> 00:55:33,834
Come on, Topper.

670
00:55:33,918 --> 00:55:36,003
Come on. Come on.

671
00:55:38,089 --> 00:55:39,674
Breathe in.

672
00:55:40,758 --> 00:55:41,884
Hey!

673
00:55:41,967 --> 00:55:43,094
All right.

674
00:55:43,302 --> 00:55:45,262
All right!

675
00:55:46,138 --> 00:55:47,807
All right.

676
00:55:51,102 --> 00:55:53,270
That corpsman on the way?

677
00:55:58,109 --> 00:56:02,071
Stand back. Give him room. Get back.

678
00:56:03,739 --> 00:56:05,866
Somebody go check on that corpsman.

679
00:56:05,950 --> 00:56:08,619
He'll be all right. Take it easy.

680
00:56:16,043 --> 00:56:17,920
Prepare for inspection!

681
00:56:21,924 --> 00:56:23,259
Shit.

682
00:56:23,342 --> 00:56:25,886
I am not going to make it.

683
00:56:33,936 --> 00:56:35,604
Help me out, Sid.

684
00:56:35,688 --> 00:56:38,983
- Got a spare?
- My spare sucks.

685
00:56:39,066 --> 00:56:41,861
You know where the hardware store is.

686
00:56:41,944 --> 00:56:45,072
Zack, I need a buckle, man.

687
00:56:47,867 --> 00:56:49,702
I can't risk it.

688
00:56:49,785 --> 00:56:51,829
You got time. He's with the girls.

689
00:56:51,912 --> 00:56:53,622
Can't do it.

690
00:56:53,706 --> 00:56:57,835
I got to see my family.
I've got to get out this weekend.

691
00:56:57,918 --> 00:57:01,839
Wouldn't want you to get
an honour violation, Perryman.

692
00:57:03,299 --> 00:57:04,759
OK.

693
00:57:08,763 --> 00:57:10,639
Attention on deck!

694
00:57:22,526 --> 00:57:28,616
In every class, there's one joker
who thinks he's smarter than me.

695
00:57:30,493 --> 00:57:36,666
In this class, that happens
to be you...isn't it, Mayonnaise?

696
00:57:45,383 --> 00:57:49,011
Perryman, Worley...
let us have this room.

697
00:57:49,095 --> 00:57:50,805
On the double.

698
00:57:50,888 --> 00:57:53,808
- Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
- Stow it.

699
00:57:58,229 --> 00:57:59,563
Mayo...

700
00:57:59,647 --> 00:58:01,565
I want you DOR.

701
00:58:04,151 --> 00:58:05,736
No, sir.

702
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:08,489
You can kick me out,
I ain't quitting.

703
00:58:16,122 --> 00:58:17,957
Get into your fatigues, Mayo.

704
00:58:18,749 --> 00:58:22,003
By the end of this weekend,
you'll quit.

705
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:31,804
Casey Jones was a son of a bitch!

706
00:58:34,807 --> 00:58:37,518
Drove his train in a 30-foot ditch!

707
00:58:39,979 --> 00:58:42,565
Came on out with his dick in his hand

708
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:47,069
Said, "Listen, ladies,
I'm a hell of a man."

709
00:58:49,572 --> 00:58:52,616
Went to his room and lined up 100.

710
00:58:55,161 --> 00:58:57,580
Swore up and down
he'd fuck every one.

711
00:58:59,999 --> 00:59:02,710
Fucked 98
till his balls turned blue.

712
00:59:05,296 --> 00:59:07,590
Then he backed off, jacked off,
and fucked the other two!

713
00:59:10,509 --> 00:59:14,764
Wave goodbye to your buddies.
I forgot. You don't have buddies.

714
00:59:14,847 --> 00:59:16,599
Only customers.

715
00:59:17,141 --> 00:59:19,185
You having fun, Mayonnaise?

716
00:59:20,269 --> 00:59:21,479
Yes, sir!

717
00:59:21,562 --> 00:59:23,481
- Don't hear you!
- Yes, sir!

718
00:59:23,564 --> 00:59:24,565
All right!

719
00:59:26,942 --> 00:59:28,694
98...

720
00:59:30,196 --> 00:59:31,322
99...

721
00:59:31,405 --> 00:59:34,617
Get your face
all the way down in there!

722
00:59:37,411 --> 00:59:38,746
100.

723
00:59:40,122 --> 00:59:44,293
- Ready to quit now, Mayo?
- No, sir!

724
00:59:44,877 --> 00:59:46,671
Look over there, Mayo.

725
00:59:48,255 --> 00:59:50,007
Look at her.

726
00:59:50,091 --> 00:59:54,512
She decided to stay instead
of taking liberty this weekend.

727
00:59:54,595 --> 00:59:58,599
She may not make it, but
she's got more heart and character

728
00:59:58,683 --> 01:00:00,142
than you'll ever have!

729
01:00:00,226 --> 01:00:02,103
And stop eyeballing me, boy!

730
01:00:04,522 --> 01:00:07,858
Life's dealt you some shitty
cards, hasn't it?

731
01:00:07,942 --> 01:00:10,361
I'm doing all right, sir!

732
01:00:12,113 --> 01:00:13,406
6...

733
01:00:13,489 --> 01:00:17,243
Bullshit. I done some checking.

734
01:00:17,326 --> 01:00:19,286
I looked through your files.

735
01:00:19,370 --> 01:00:23,457
I know about your mama.
Don't you eyeball me.

736
01:00:23,541 --> 01:00:27,044
I know your father's an alcoholic
and a whore chaser.

737
01:00:27,628 --> 01:00:29,922
That's why you don't mesh, Mayo.

738
01:00:30,006 --> 01:00:33,759
Because deep down...
Don't you eyeball me, boy!

739
01:00:34,719 --> 01:00:37,221
Deep down inside...

740
01:00:37,304 --> 01:00:40,433
you know the others
are better than you!

741
01:00:40,516 --> 01:00:42,351
Isn't that right, Mayo?

742
01:00:42,435 --> 01:00:45,730
No, sir! No, sir!

743
01:00:49,859 --> 01:00:53,237
What's the matter? You getting tired?
I'm not tired.

744
01:00:53,321 --> 01:00:55,114
Move it, boy!

745
01:00:55,197 --> 01:00:57,658
This is where the fun starts!

746
01:00:58,576 --> 01:00:59,910
Move it!

747
01:00:59,994 --> 01:01:03,372
You got all day tomorrow
to look forward to!

748
01:01:12,048 --> 01:01:15,676
6 inches off the ground.
Give me 6 to 90.

749
01:01:18,429 --> 01:01:22,183
Hey, Mayo, why don't we quit
this little charade

750
01:01:22,266 --> 01:01:25,019
over a couple of beers at TJ's?

751
01:01:25,102 --> 01:01:28,939
You're as close
to being officer material as me.

752
01:01:29,023 --> 01:01:32,485
This candidate believes
he would make a good officer!

753
01:01:32,568 --> 01:01:37,990
You only give a shit about yourself.
All your classmates know it.

754
01:01:38,074 --> 01:01:42,244
Do you think they would trust you
behind the controls of a plane?

755
01:01:42,328 --> 01:01:47,792
You'd probably zipp off in my F-14
and sell it to the Cubans.

756
01:01:47,875 --> 01:01:50,753
No, sir! No, sir! I love my country.

757
01:01:50,836 --> 01:01:53,839
Sell it to the air force, Mayo.

758
01:01:56,092 --> 01:02:01,931
Why would a slick hustler like you
sign up for this abuse?

759
01:02:02,014 --> 01:02:03,808
I want to fly jets.

760
01:02:03,891 --> 01:02:05,977
My grandmama wants to fly jets.

761
01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:07,770
I've always wanted it!

762
01:02:07,853 --> 01:02:10,898
We're not talking about flying.
We're talking about character.

763
01:02:11,941 --> 01:02:13,567
I've changed, sir.

764
01:02:13,651 --> 01:02:16,737
- The hell you have.
- I've changed, sir!

765
01:02:16,821 --> 01:02:21,450
You've just polished your act.
You've shined it up!

766
01:02:21,534 --> 01:02:25,579
Tell me what I want to hear.
I want your DOR.

767
01:02:25,663 --> 01:02:28,666
I ain't going to quit.

768
01:02:28,749 --> 01:02:31,919
- Spell it! D-O-R.
- I ain't gonna quit!

769
01:02:32,003 --> 01:02:36,257
Then you and your daddy can get drunk
and go whore-chasing together!

770
01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:39,051
No, sir! I ain't going to quit!

771
01:02:39,135 --> 01:02:41,971
Then forget it. You're out!

772
01:02:42,054 --> 01:02:43,806
Don't you do it!

773
01:02:43,889 --> 01:02:45,641
Don't...you...

774
01:02:47,643 --> 01:02:50,021
I got nowhere else to go!

775
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:54,191
I got nowhere else to go!

776
01:03:01,615 --> 01:03:03,576
I ain't got nothing else.

777
01:03:07,121 --> 01:03:09,040
I got nothing else.

778
01:03:10,416 --> 01:03:14,337
All right, Mayo. On your feet.

779
01:03:37,151 --> 01:03:40,237
Come on, Mayo,
let's get back to the barracks.

780
01:03:40,321 --> 01:03:42,323
Hey, Foley!

781
01:03:42,406 --> 01:03:46,577
Zack, don't give up!
You got that queer on the run!

782
01:03:46,661 --> 01:03:48,579
Kiss this, Foley!

783
01:03:48,663 --> 01:03:51,582
Hang in there, Zack!
Remember the Tides Inn.

784
01:03:51,666 --> 01:03:53,125
Those friends of yours?

785
01:03:53,209 --> 01:03:56,170
- Don't give up, Mayo!
- Yes, sir.

786
01:03:56,253 --> 01:03:58,047
We're with you, Zack!

787
01:03:58,130 --> 01:04:00,383
Zack, you can make it!

788
01:04:01,092 --> 01:04:03,803
You got some urinals to clean.

789
01:04:03,886 --> 01:04:05,346
Move out.

790
01:04:05,429 --> 01:04:09,850
Hey, Foley's queer!
He got his balls shot off in the war!

791
01:04:27,034 --> 01:04:29,453
You're still here, Mayo?

792
01:04:45,803 --> 01:04:48,556
- Sid.
- Yeah?

793
01:04:50,933 --> 01:04:52,226
Thanks.

794
01:05:01,777 --> 01:05:03,195
Sid.

795
01:05:04,697 --> 01:05:06,115
Look at that.

796
01:05:10,536 --> 01:05:12,204
That son of a bitch.

797
01:07:00,896 --> 01:07:03,065
Want me to get a towel?

798
01:07:04,358 --> 01:07:06,319
I'll get one.

799
01:07:06,402 --> 01:07:08,738
I don't want you to move.

800
01:07:10,781 --> 01:07:14,702
Somebody's got to move sometime...
eventually.

801
01:07:16,954 --> 01:07:19,373
"They found them there weeks later,

802
01:07:19,457 --> 01:07:22,501
"shrivelled from lack
of food and water."

803
01:07:31,177 --> 01:07:32,678
Bye, Zachary.

804
01:07:43,731 --> 01:07:47,735
I laughed all week, thinking
about you guys on that boat.

805
01:07:48,819 --> 01:07:50,863
We were so drunk.

806
01:08:03,292 --> 01:08:06,003
Pretty sharp, Paula. Pretty sharp.

807
01:08:09,006 --> 01:08:11,258
I'd love to be one of those girls

808
01:08:11,342 --> 01:08:13,678
they're letting in
the flight programme.

809
01:08:13,761 --> 01:08:16,263
It would be a gas to fly.

810
01:08:16,347 --> 01:08:17,932
What's stopping you?

811
01:08:21,936 --> 01:08:25,022
You know what those magazines say.
It's just...

812
01:08:25,106 --> 01:08:29,193
I don't know.
It's not so easy for a girl.

813
01:08:29,276 --> 01:08:33,114
That's still no excuse
for not getting what you want.

814
01:08:33,531 --> 01:08:34,949
Just go get it.

815
01:08:38,911 --> 01:08:42,331
Who says I'm not going
after what I want?

816
01:08:44,083 --> 01:08:45,501
Not me.

817
01:08:48,337 --> 01:08:50,673
My mama's 39 years old.

818
01:08:51,298 --> 01:08:53,926
She still works over at that factory.

819
01:08:55,720 --> 01:09:00,349
Every time I look at her,
I know exactly what I don't want.

820
01:09:05,396 --> 01:09:07,273
My old lady...

821
01:09:09,692 --> 01:09:12,778
took a bottle of pills one day
when I was at school.

822
01:09:12,862 --> 01:09:14,155
Oh, God.

823
01:09:19,493 --> 01:09:22,038
The thing that got me about it...

824
01:09:25,374 --> 01:09:28,169
She didn't leave a note.
She didn't...

825
01:09:31,714 --> 01:09:34,175
Nothing. She just checked out.

826
01:09:38,721 --> 01:09:40,848
I always hated her for that.

827
01:09:42,892 --> 01:09:47,688
Oh, God. That must really hurt.

828
01:09:48,773 --> 01:09:52,526
Hurt? No. No.

829
01:09:52,610 --> 01:09:54,612
You're all alone in the world.

830
01:09:55,821 --> 01:09:59,742
Once you got that down,
nothing hurts anymore.

831
01:10:03,371 --> 01:10:08,000
I bet most people buy that line
when you feed it to them.

832
01:10:33,442 --> 01:10:37,113
Hey, are you really serious
about having him over?

833
01:10:37,196 --> 01:10:39,865
I haven't made up my mind yet.

834
01:10:40,992 --> 01:10:44,912
Paula...just how far
would you go to get Zack?

835
01:10:44,996 --> 01:10:48,666
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.

836
01:10:48,749 --> 01:10:51,544
Would you let yourself get pregnant?

837
01:10:51,752 --> 01:10:54,046
No way, Lynette. Would you?

838
01:10:55,423 --> 01:11:00,720
Well...I never used to think
I'd do something like that.

839
01:11:00,803 --> 01:11:02,513
But I don't know anymore.

840
01:11:02,596 --> 01:11:07,893
Nine weeks just ain't long enough
for a guy to fall in love with you.

841
01:11:07,977 --> 01:11:11,939
That doesn't justify trapping him
or getting pregnant.

842
01:11:12,023 --> 01:11:15,151
I can't believe you'd think that.
It's real backward.

843
01:11:15,234 --> 01:11:17,486
It ain't any more backward

844
01:11:17,570 --> 01:11:22,616
than the way these hotshot assholes
use us till they've had enough,

845
01:11:22,700 --> 01:11:25,202
then ditch us like we's trash.

846
01:11:25,411 --> 01:11:27,830
Don't you ever feel used, Paula?

847
01:11:27,913 --> 01:11:33,294
Don't you feel the sons of bitches
ought to be paying for our troubles?

848
01:11:33,377 --> 01:11:36,881
No. I never feel like that.

849
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:41,469
Well, I do.

850
01:11:58,694 --> 01:12:00,905
Thanks again for the flowers, Zack.

851
01:12:00,988 --> 01:12:04,200
It was my pleasure.

852
01:12:04,283 --> 01:12:07,411
Those are the most beautiful
things I've ever saw.

853
01:12:09,413 --> 01:12:11,707
Wipe that stuff off your mouth.

854
01:12:13,751 --> 01:12:15,044
Zack?

855
01:12:18,881 --> 01:12:20,591
This is great.

856
01:12:24,470 --> 01:12:25,763
Sir?

857
01:12:30,893 --> 01:12:33,437
How many more weeks till graduation?

858
01:12:33,521 --> 01:12:36,107
Three more. Three more weeks.

859
01:12:37,191 --> 01:12:39,402
Those are the roughest, aren't they?

860
01:12:39,485 --> 01:12:41,529
That's what they tell me.

861
01:12:51,163 --> 01:12:54,041
Sir, why are you staring at my food?

862
01:12:55,126 --> 01:12:57,294
Or are you staring at me?

863
01:12:57,378 --> 01:12:59,588
Staring at you.

864
01:12:59,672 --> 01:13:03,592
He doesn't mean anything by it.
Do you, Joe?

865
01:13:06,512 --> 01:13:08,973
No, I don't mean anything by it.

866
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:21,152
- Like some more chicken, Zack?
- No. No, thanks.

867
01:13:22,695 --> 01:13:25,573
I've had it.
I can't eat another bite.

868
01:13:25,656 --> 01:13:27,575
I'm stuffed, too.

869
01:13:27,658 --> 01:13:31,579
This is the best meal
I've had in a long time.

870
01:13:31,662 --> 01:13:35,249
Let's go, Zack. Thank you, Mama.

871
01:13:35,333 --> 01:13:38,044
- Thank you, Zack.
- Thanks again, ma'am.

872
01:13:39,545 --> 01:13:41,130
Go on and eat.

873
01:13:45,468 --> 01:13:47,094
Mama, Mama, Mama!

874
01:13:47,178 --> 01:13:50,139
I'm sorry. I'm so embarrassed, Zack.

875
01:13:50,222 --> 01:13:52,516
I shouldn't have brought you here.

876
01:13:53,768 --> 01:13:58,189
That's OK. A great free meal.
A nice, relaxing dinner.

877
01:14:01,150 --> 01:14:04,737
Those people are so uptight.
I felt so sorry for you.

878
01:14:04,820 --> 01:14:08,991
Don't. I'm used to it.
It's hereditary.

879
01:14:09,075 --> 01:14:14,288
After this, you go to basic flight
which is in Pensacola, right?

880
01:14:14,372 --> 01:14:16,957
Yeah, Pensacola.

881
01:14:17,917 --> 01:14:22,046
And...going to Beeville, Texas,
when I get jets.

882
01:14:24,715 --> 01:14:27,802
So, after that...
don't you think about...

883
01:14:27,885 --> 01:14:31,847
I mean, come on... What's after that?

884
01:14:31,931 --> 01:14:35,935
Family, kids...
Don't you think about all that?

885
01:14:37,478 --> 01:14:40,147
No.

886
01:14:40,231 --> 01:14:43,526
- Is that what you think about?
- Sometimes.

887
01:14:44,694 --> 01:14:48,781
If I could do a better job than them,
I'd love it.

888
01:14:49,490 --> 01:14:51,826
And what would you do different?

889
01:14:52,451 --> 01:14:53,786
Everything.

890
01:14:54,412 --> 01:14:57,498
First, I'd marry a man
I really loved.

891
01:14:59,291 --> 01:15:03,671
So why did your mom marry this guy
if she didn't love him?

892
01:15:03,754 --> 01:15:06,716
My real father wouldn't marry her.

893
01:15:07,675 --> 01:15:11,095
- Your real father?
- My real father.

894
01:15:11,178 --> 01:15:13,764
I want to show you my real father.

895
01:15:14,849 --> 01:15:16,350
Pop.

896
01:15:22,523 --> 01:15:26,944
Your real father
was an Officers Candidate like me?

897
01:15:27,653 --> 01:15:30,614
- About 22 years ago.
- Jesus.

898
01:15:31,949 --> 01:15:34,910
No wonder this guy was looking
at me funny.

899
01:15:34,994 --> 01:15:36,912
He always looks funny.

900
01:15:49,133 --> 01:15:52,136
It's about time
I got back to the wars.

901
01:15:52,219 --> 01:15:54,138
Yeah, I know, I know.

902
01:16:00,186 --> 01:16:02,521
Thank your mom for dinner, OK?

903
01:16:02,605 --> 01:16:05,566
- Great chicken, huh?
- I loved the chicken.

904
01:16:07,318 --> 01:16:11,030
If you get a chance,
why don't you call me?

905
01:16:11,113 --> 01:16:16,035
I have survival training this week,
so I can't make any promises.

906
01:16:16,118 --> 01:16:17,662
No promises.

907
01:16:19,121 --> 01:16:23,459
I didn't have to show you
that picture if I didn't want to.

908
01:16:23,542 --> 01:16:27,672
- I wanted to tell you that.
- I know. Bye, baby.

909
01:16:31,467 --> 01:16:34,512
- Be careful on that.
- Yeah.

910
01:17:15,052 --> 01:17:18,931
You and Paula still seeing
those flight candidates?

911
01:17:19,015 --> 01:17:21,267
Any reason we wouldn't be?

912
01:17:21,350 --> 01:17:26,272
It's 3:40 and you haven't said
what you're doing this weekend.

913
01:17:26,647 --> 01:17:30,985
Hi. I'd like to speak with Zack Mayo.
He's an AOC candidate.

914
01:17:32,945 --> 01:17:36,115
Could you look for him?
Tell him it's Paula.

915
01:17:36,198 --> 01:17:38,909
Liberty time, boys and girls.

916
01:17:40,786 --> 01:17:42,538
Fall out!

917
01:17:43,748 --> 01:17:45,499
Aye, aye, sir!

918
01:17:47,918 --> 01:17:50,963
- Where you going? Where's my bread?
- Forget that thing.

919
01:17:51,047 --> 01:17:52,840
Come on, Perryman. Come on.

920
01:17:52,923 --> 01:17:56,260
- Seeger, don't forget TJ's.
- I won't.

921
01:17:56,344 --> 01:17:59,805
Hey, Mayo! You got a phone call.
Somebody named Paula.

922
01:18:00,890 --> 01:18:02,725
Tell her I already split.

923
01:18:13,611 --> 01:18:16,072
I see. OK.

924
01:18:16,906 --> 01:18:20,409
Comes a time
right after survival training,

925
01:18:20,493 --> 01:18:23,579
they start thinking
they can make it without you.

926
01:18:23,663 --> 01:18:26,082
Suddenly, they stop calling.

927
01:18:26,165 --> 01:18:28,793
Suddenly, they own the goddamn world.

928
01:18:31,337 --> 01:18:33,839
They said that he already left.

929
01:18:34,965 --> 01:18:37,385
I don't think he did.

930
01:18:37,468 --> 01:18:40,262
He hasn't called by now,
he won't call.

931
01:18:40,346 --> 01:18:43,808
Bunny, just shut up!
You don't know so much.

932
01:18:43,891 --> 01:18:45,810
Clock me out, Lynette.

933
01:18:45,893 --> 01:18:48,479
Paula, what are you doing?

934
01:18:48,562 --> 01:18:51,524
May they all crash and burn.

935
01:18:56,153 --> 01:18:59,824
- Paula, wait! Where are you going?
- Let me go, Mama.

936
01:18:59,907 --> 01:19:02,952
You're going to look for Zack.
Don't do it.

937
01:19:03,035 --> 01:19:05,830
I love him. I can't let him go.

938
01:19:05,913 --> 01:19:07,623
How will you stop him?

939
01:19:07,707 --> 01:19:09,917
I don't know,
but I'll think of a way.

940
01:19:10,001 --> 01:19:11,877
- No!
- No?

941
01:19:11,961 --> 01:19:17,842
I can't let you do this.
Don't go. Please, don't go.

942
01:19:17,925 --> 01:19:20,177
What are you crying about?

943
01:19:21,595 --> 01:19:24,015
Cos I know what you're feeling!

944
01:19:24,098 --> 01:19:27,893
- What am I feeling?
- Don't do it. Let him go.

945
01:19:27,977 --> 01:19:30,521
Don't trick him or trap him.

946
01:19:30,604 --> 01:19:34,734
I wouldn't do that.
I'd never try to trap him.

947
01:19:34,817 --> 01:19:39,280
If you find him,
you'll say anything. You will.

948
01:19:39,363 --> 01:19:42,325
And God help you after that.

949
01:19:50,833 --> 01:19:52,710
Mama, you're right.

950
01:19:56,672 --> 01:20:01,969
Daddy, Zack's 2/10 of a second
off the obstacle course record.

951
01:20:02,053 --> 01:20:04,096
He'll break it before he leaves.

952
01:20:04,180 --> 01:20:07,642
Lucky you weren't
in the programme when I was.

953
01:20:07,725 --> 01:20:11,145
You couldn't quit
the way you can now.

954
01:20:11,228 --> 01:20:14,482
When I and my oldest boy
went through it,

955
01:20:14,565 --> 01:20:17,610
you bilged out, you became a swabby.

956
01:20:17,693 --> 01:20:20,237
That's real interesting, sir.

957
01:20:20,321 --> 01:20:24,033
How come you haven't written
Susan in over three weeks?

958
01:20:25,993 --> 01:20:30,956
We haven't had time to write anybody.
I've only written y'all once.

959
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:32,792
It's incredible.

960
01:20:34,627 --> 01:20:37,546
- Right?
- Yeah.

961
01:20:45,137 --> 01:20:48,891
- Who is this Susan?
- My girl back home.

962
01:20:48,975 --> 01:20:52,436
I'm marrying her
as soon I get out of here.

963
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:56,023
She was Tommy's girl.

964
01:20:56,107 --> 01:20:59,568
They were supposed to get
married before he got killed.

965
01:21:02,571 --> 01:21:07,284
I didn't want you to think
I was a shit for fucking Lynette.

966
01:21:07,368 --> 01:21:09,453
Man, I ain't your parents.

967
01:21:12,415 --> 01:21:14,333
Do you love this girl?

968
01:21:14,417 --> 01:21:17,962
Greatest chick you'll ever know.
She loves kids.

969
01:21:18,045 --> 01:21:21,382
Works with handicapped kids
every afternoon.

970
01:21:23,009 --> 01:21:27,680
That ain't what I'm talking about.
I asked you if you loved her.

971
01:21:27,763 --> 01:21:30,474
Everybody loves her.

972
01:21:30,558 --> 01:21:34,395
- I won't make that reunion tonight.
- Why not?

973
01:21:35,021 --> 01:21:37,523
I'm meeting Lynette at the Tides.

974
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:42,862
Best head in 52 states.
What can I do?

975
01:21:43,863 --> 01:21:45,489
No, no, no.

976
01:21:45,573 --> 01:21:48,826
You should've done what I did...
break it off clean,

977
01:21:48,909 --> 01:21:52,872
have it done with, over.
It's the best.

978
01:21:55,124 --> 01:21:57,918
She was torn up you didn't call her.

979
01:21:58,002 --> 01:22:00,463
I'm not supposed to tell you that.

980
01:22:07,970 --> 01:22:10,348
Women. Women, women, women.

981
01:22:12,516 --> 01:22:16,937
They say, "A lot of laughs,
no problems."

982
01:22:19,523 --> 01:22:22,485
Doesn't work that way, does it?

983
01:22:26,405 --> 01:22:29,158
Look out, TJ's! Here I come.

984
01:22:30,951 --> 01:22:32,828
See you later, man.

985
01:22:34,580 --> 01:22:38,167
I don't know
what you're smiling about, Perryman.

986
01:22:38,250 --> 01:22:40,086
You're lucky you're here.

987
01:22:40,169 --> 01:22:43,881
- What are you talking about?
- I still taste that bug.

988
01:22:43,964 --> 01:22:46,384
A toast. We made it. To survival.

989
01:22:46,467 --> 01:22:49,470
- To survival.
- To survival.

990
01:22:49,553 --> 01:22:51,263
In spite of Perryman.

991
01:22:52,765 --> 01:22:54,850
In spite of Foley.

992
01:22:55,434 --> 01:22:57,770
Is that your Deb over there?

993
01:23:10,533 --> 01:23:14,412
She's pulling rank on you.
That's a flight instructor.

994
01:23:36,058 --> 01:23:37,351
Back in a minute.

995
01:23:56,620 --> 01:23:58,664
What are you doing here?

996
01:23:59,749 --> 01:24:03,419
It was time for me to see
the legendary TJ's

997
01:24:03,502 --> 01:24:05,546
once before I left here.

998
01:24:08,799 --> 01:24:10,509
You come here a lot?

999
01:24:10,593 --> 01:24:13,054
I come here once in a while.

1000
01:24:16,015 --> 01:24:18,726
I'm sorry I didn't call you
this weekend.

1001
01:24:18,809 --> 01:24:21,103
This week has been unbelievable.

1002
01:24:21,187 --> 01:24:22,563
It's OK.

1003
01:24:22,647 --> 01:24:24,732
How did the survival training go?

1004
01:24:24,815 --> 01:24:27,526
- I survived.
- You survived. Obviously.

1005
01:24:29,612 --> 01:24:32,490
How was your week?

1006
01:24:32,573 --> 01:24:34,533
It was good.

1007
01:24:34,617 --> 01:24:37,453
I'm getting a raise
beginning of next month.

1008
01:24:37,536 --> 01:24:39,121
That's great.

1009
01:24:41,707 --> 01:24:44,377
You're graduating in a couple weeks?

1010
01:24:44,835 --> 01:24:46,170
Yeah.

1011
01:24:46,253 --> 01:24:49,215
I'm starting to believe I'll make it.

1012
01:24:49,298 --> 01:24:51,050
You'll make it.

1013
01:24:51,133 --> 01:24:54,720
I told you -
you saw it, and it happened.

1014
01:24:54,804 --> 01:24:56,764
Yeah, you told me.

1015
01:24:59,850 --> 01:25:03,312
I got to go, I have a date. So...

1016
01:25:04,355 --> 01:25:06,148
Look, there's something I wanted...

1017
01:25:08,442 --> 01:25:11,112
What?

1018
01:25:11,195 --> 01:25:13,739
I...I wanted to thank you.

1019
01:25:16,492 --> 01:25:19,203
I wouldn't have made it
through this crazy thing

1020
01:25:19,286 --> 01:25:22,289
if I didn't have something
to look forward to.

1021
01:25:22,373 --> 01:25:25,876
Don't thank me for nothing.
I had a good time.

1022
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:29,380
Good luck in Pensacola
with your flight training, and...

1023
01:25:30,631 --> 01:25:32,550
Get jets, huh?

1024
01:25:37,888 --> 01:25:39,640
I'll see you, Zack.

1025
01:25:48,983 --> 01:25:50,693
Give me another one.

1026
01:25:55,197 --> 01:25:57,908
In fact, give me the bottle.

1027
01:26:01,704 --> 01:26:04,081
Come here, baby doll.

1028
01:26:04,165 --> 01:26:05,624
Come here.

1029
01:26:09,545 --> 01:26:11,505
Come over here.

1030
01:26:12,882 --> 01:26:16,260
Sit down for a second.
I'll tell you something.

1031
01:26:22,892 --> 01:26:25,394
Had to have one more taste.

1032
01:26:25,478 --> 01:26:29,774
This stuff come in anything
besides strawberry?

1033
01:26:29,857 --> 01:26:32,777
I'll bring some coconut next time.

1034
01:26:38,824 --> 01:26:41,619
Sid...l've really got to go.

1035
01:26:47,541 --> 01:26:51,462
Shouldn't you have
got your period by now?

1036
01:26:51,545 --> 01:26:53,798
I'm a little late, that's all.

1037
01:26:56,425 --> 01:26:58,886
How late are you?

1038
01:26:58,970 --> 01:27:00,388
Why? What's the difference?

1039
01:27:00,471 --> 01:27:05,351
If anything happened,
it would be my responsibility.

1040
01:27:08,062 --> 01:27:10,523
Now, just exactly how late are you?

1041
01:27:10,606 --> 01:27:14,193
What do you care?
Suppose I was to get pregnant.

1042
01:27:14,276 --> 01:27:19,865
Just suppose. I'd never make you do
something you didn't want to do.

1043
01:27:19,949 --> 01:27:22,493
I know.

1044
01:27:22,576 --> 01:27:27,164
But that's not the only issue here.
There's more to it than that.

1045
01:27:27,248 --> 01:27:29,542
What other issue is there, Sid?

1046
01:27:35,214 --> 01:27:38,509
My responsibility as its father,
for one thing.

1047
01:27:38,592 --> 01:27:43,431
If I've got you pregnant,
I'll do the right thing by you.

1048
01:27:43,514 --> 01:27:49,228
I'll pay for the abortion,
be with you through it, comfort you.

1049
01:27:49,312 --> 01:27:52,315
We'd go through it together.

1050
01:27:54,859 --> 01:27:56,819
So how late are you?

1051
01:27:59,697 --> 01:28:02,575
Let's just wait
and see what happens, OK?

1052
01:28:05,953 --> 01:28:07,371
See you later.

1053
01:28:09,165 --> 01:28:10,458
I'll call you.

1054
01:28:10,541 --> 01:28:11,542
Fuck!

1055
01:28:13,210 --> 01:28:15,296
Last chance for the record!

1056
01:28:15,421 --> 01:28:16,839
Go!

1057
01:28:17,381 --> 01:28:19,759
This is it, Mayonnaise. Go!

1058
01:28:31,687 --> 01:28:32,980
Come on!

1059
01:28:33,064 --> 01:28:36,400
Go for it, Mayo!
Go get it! You got it!

1060
01:28:45,201 --> 01:28:47,119
Go, Mayo! Push it!

1061
01:28:47,203 --> 01:28:50,164
Put your name on that wall!

1062
01:28:58,506 --> 01:29:00,675
Mike, let's catch that animal!

1063
01:29:09,850 --> 01:29:11,560
Let's do this together, Seeger.

1064
01:29:19,485 --> 01:29:23,155
- Come on, Seeger.
- Forget it, just go for the record.

1065
01:29:30,579 --> 01:29:32,415
Come on! You got it!

1066
01:29:33,207 --> 01:29:34,792
Come on, man!

1067
01:29:34,875 --> 01:29:37,044
Hey! Where you going?

1068
01:29:37,128 --> 01:29:39,505
- Seeger, get up.
- Forget it.

1069
01:29:39,588 --> 01:29:44,552
You want jets? Then get up!
You're going over! Right here!

1070
01:29:46,220 --> 01:29:48,264
Three steps. Right, left, right.

1071
01:29:48,347 --> 01:29:50,850
Hand over hand. Walk the wall.

1072
01:29:50,933 --> 01:29:53,644
- Come on, Seeger.
- Ready? Let's go!

1073
01:29:53,728 --> 01:29:58,274
Left, right, pull!
Walk that wall, Seeger! Walk it!

1074
01:29:58,357 --> 01:30:01,944
Hand over hand!
Hand over hand! Walk it! Walk it!

1075
01:30:02,028 --> 01:30:06,032
Walk the wall! Seeger! Seeger, walk!

1076
01:30:06,115 --> 01:30:07,950
Seeger!

1077
01:30:08,034 --> 01:30:13,873
Don't you let go! You walk that wall!
Pull! Pull! Pull, Candidate Seeger!

1078
01:30:13,956 --> 01:30:18,461
Pull! One leg! You got it!
Pull over! Pull over!

1079
01:30:18,544 --> 01:30:21,922
Pull yourself over! All right!

1080
01:30:43,194 --> 01:30:44,612
Where's Sid?

1081
01:30:51,077 --> 01:30:53,329
What makes you think she's not lying?

1082
01:30:53,412 --> 01:30:56,624
She went to a doctor. She's pregnant.

1083
01:30:57,750 --> 01:30:59,752
So get an abortion.

1084
01:30:59,835 --> 01:31:03,798
I'd love to, believe me.
She won't even talk about it.

1085
01:31:03,881 --> 01:31:05,341
She's Catholic.

1086
01:31:05,424 --> 01:31:08,344
You're not marrying this girl.

1087
01:31:09,804 --> 01:31:14,058
If I don't, she'll have the baby
on her own somewhere.

1088
01:31:14,141 --> 01:31:16,185
Women do it all the time.

1089
01:31:16,268 --> 01:31:21,273
I can't let her have a kid
by herself. It's my kid, too.

1090
01:31:21,357 --> 01:31:23,025
You sure?

1091
01:31:24,610 --> 01:31:26,112
It's mine.

1092
01:31:33,536 --> 01:31:35,329
I'm sorry, all right?

1093
01:31:36,956 --> 01:31:41,127
What if Foley was right?
She got knocked up to trap you.

1094
01:31:41,210 --> 01:31:43,004
Is it still your responsibility?

1095
01:31:43,087 --> 01:31:44,588
That's not the point.

1096
01:31:44,672 --> 01:31:48,759
No matter how it happened,
the child would still be mine.

1097
01:31:48,843 --> 01:31:51,512
I wouldn't know
where it was or nothing.

1098
01:31:51,595 --> 01:31:54,432
Jesus Christ!
Is everything your responsibility?

1099
01:31:58,019 --> 01:32:02,565
Sit. Adjust. Pray. Attack.

1100
01:32:03,607 --> 01:32:06,152
It's like your brother
getting killed.

1101
01:32:06,235 --> 01:32:11,115
It's the same damn thing -
him getting killed instead of you.

1102
01:32:11,198 --> 01:32:13,826
That's why you promised
to marry Susan.

1103
01:32:13,909 --> 01:32:18,122
You do everything
out of some bullshit code of ethics.

1104
01:32:18,205 --> 01:32:23,544
It may be bullshit to you,
but I wasn't raised that way!

1105
01:32:23,627 --> 01:32:26,255
We're responsible
for the people in our lives.

1106
01:32:26,339 --> 01:32:29,133
That's all that separates us
from the animals!

1107
01:32:29,216 --> 01:32:31,010
I'm not like you, Mayo.

1108
01:32:31,093 --> 01:32:34,680
I can't shit on people
and sleep at night.

1109
01:32:34,764 --> 01:32:37,183
I say you're responsible
to yourself first.

1110
01:32:37,266 --> 01:32:39,060
If you can't handle that,

1111
01:32:39,143 --> 01:32:42,188
you got bigger problems
than making some girl pregnant!

1112
01:32:42,271 --> 01:32:44,440
Gentlemen, relax.

1113
01:33:02,124 --> 01:33:04,919
Without an oxygen mask
at 30,000 feet,

1114
01:33:05,002 --> 01:33:07,880
your insides will feel
like this rubber glove.

1115
01:33:07,964 --> 01:33:09,632
Your coordination deteriorates.

1116
01:33:09,715 --> 01:33:12,635
Even the most childlike exercises
seem impossible.

1117
01:33:12,718 --> 01:33:14,929
Look for the warning signs -

1118
01:33:15,012 --> 01:33:17,473
giddiness, shortness of breath,
claustrophobia.

1119
01:33:17,556 --> 01:33:20,017
They can hit you at any moment.

1120
01:33:20,101 --> 01:33:23,813
The instant you feel yourself
losing control, go back on oxygen.

1121
01:33:23,896 --> 01:33:26,023
That's the purpose of this drill.

1122
01:33:26,107 --> 01:33:28,275
Does everyone understand
the exercises?

1123
01:33:29,318 --> 01:33:32,780
OK, everybody set?
Let's see a thumbs up, please.

1124
01:33:33,739 --> 01:33:36,909
Very good. Everybody remove
your mask, please.

1125
01:33:36,993 --> 01:33:40,204
All right. Begin the exercises now.

1126
01:33:45,543 --> 01:33:46,877
Queen of diamonds.

1127
01:33:49,547 --> 01:33:51,299
Nine of diamonds.

1128
01:33:53,175 --> 01:33:55,886
If you have any problems,
put your mask on.

1129
01:33:56,512 --> 01:34:01,475
If you can't, raise your hand,
and the corpsman will assist you.

1130
01:34:01,559 --> 01:34:05,396
How you doing, Mayo and Seeger?
Having a little trouble?

1131
01:34:06,981 --> 01:34:09,525
Concentrate.
Try to make your palms meet.

1132
01:34:13,529 --> 01:34:14,947
Ace of spades.

1133
01:34:17,533 --> 01:34:19,577
How you doing down there, Worley?

1134
01:34:21,579 --> 01:34:23,372
Worley, are you all right?

1135
01:34:27,168 --> 01:34:30,296
- Worley, can you hear me?
- Ace of spades.

1136
01:34:30,379 --> 01:34:32,673
Worley, put your mask back on,
please.

1137
01:34:32,757 --> 01:34:34,592
Put your mask back on!

1138
01:34:34,675 --> 01:34:37,053
- Sid, you OK?
- Sid!

1139
01:34:37,136 --> 01:34:38,846
I got to get out.

1140
01:34:38,929 --> 01:34:42,683
Worley, sit down.
Corpsman, we got a problem.

1141
01:34:42,767 --> 01:34:45,102
I got to get out of here!

1142
01:34:45,186 --> 01:34:47,104
Corpsman, get that mask on.

1143
01:34:47,188 --> 01:34:48,522
It's all right.

1144
01:34:49,106 --> 01:34:52,985
Get out of here!
It's all right. Breathe! Breathe!

1145
01:34:53,069 --> 01:34:55,237
Mayo, they're watching!

1146
01:34:55,571 --> 01:34:57,907
We're going
to stabilise the pressure.

1147
01:34:57,990 --> 01:35:00,117
It's OK. All right. Everything's OK.

1148
01:35:01,160 --> 01:35:03,371
Everybody's watching you. Hold on.

1149
01:35:03,454 --> 01:35:07,083
We'll stabilise the pressure now.
Man the doors. One minute.

1150
01:35:07,166 --> 01:35:09,794
Stay where you are.
Leave your masks on!

1151
01:35:09,877 --> 01:35:11,712
- He's got it.
- He's fine.

1152
01:35:11,796 --> 01:35:15,841
He's OK. No problem. He's OK.

1153
01:35:17,218 --> 01:35:18,761
Colours!

1154
01:35:35,611 --> 01:35:37,154
Secure the halyard!

1155
01:35:40,616 --> 01:35:42,702
Charlie, take care of that.

1156
01:35:45,538 --> 01:35:48,499
What's going on?

1157
01:35:48,582 --> 01:35:50,751
You didn't kick him out?

1158
01:35:51,127 --> 01:35:54,130
Did he tell you what
he's been going through?

1159
01:35:54,213 --> 01:35:56,173
It doesn't matter.

1160
01:35:56,257 --> 01:36:01,345
What does matter is that
he freaked out at 25,000 feet.

1161
01:36:01,429 --> 01:36:03,264
That can't happen ever.

1162
01:36:03,347 --> 01:36:06,183
He's got a girl who's pregnant.

1163
01:36:06,267 --> 01:36:07,893
That don't matter.

1164
01:36:07,977 --> 01:36:11,522
Don't matter?
You've got two weeks left!

1165
01:36:11,605 --> 01:36:14,900
That can happen to you,
too, Mayonnaise.

1166
01:36:14,984 --> 01:36:17,028
He ain't bullshitting you, buddy.

1167
01:36:17,111 --> 01:36:19,530
I'm talking to you, motherfucker!

1168
01:36:19,739 --> 01:36:21,407
Don't fuck for you!

1169
01:36:21,490 --> 01:36:23,492
What did you call me?

1170
01:36:30,708 --> 01:36:33,419
I thought the DI's
were supposed to help.

1171
01:36:33,502 --> 01:36:36,130
What kind of a human being are you?

1172
01:36:36,213 --> 01:36:39,008
Lock it up or you'll go with him.

1173
01:36:39,091 --> 01:36:41,385
Go back to the barracks. Please?

1174
01:36:42,720 --> 01:36:46,849
I don't get this.
He's the best candidate in the class!

1175
01:36:47,975 --> 01:36:52,813
The best student, the best leader...
the best friend to everybody.

1176
01:36:52,897 --> 01:36:55,483
Can't you bend your goddamn rules?

1177
01:36:55,566 --> 01:36:59,070
He didn't ask me to DOR.
I went to him.

1178
01:36:59,153 --> 01:37:00,946
What are you talking about?

1179
01:37:01,030 --> 01:37:05,117
I'm glad it's over.
I was here for everybody but me.

1180
01:37:08,579 --> 01:37:11,040
I was here for my big brother.

1181
01:37:13,626 --> 01:37:15,002
Hey, buddy.

1182
01:37:15,586 --> 01:37:18,631
Sid, wait a minute. Sid!

1183
01:37:25,012 --> 01:37:27,556
Request permission to carry on...

1184
01:37:28,057 --> 01:37:29,183
Sir!

1185
01:37:30,142 --> 01:37:32,228
Get the fuck out of here.

1186
01:37:45,741 --> 01:37:50,121
- Yes, sir. Keep the change.
- Thanks, pal.

1187
01:37:54,834 --> 01:37:56,168
Lynette!

1188
01:38:01,215 --> 01:38:03,551
- Hi, baby.
- Hi, Sid.

1189
01:38:03,634 --> 01:38:05,136
Come here a minute.

1190
01:38:05,219 --> 01:38:07,722
What are you doing out of uniform?

1191
01:38:07,805 --> 01:38:10,975
- I got something.
- Wait. I look a mess.

1192
01:38:11,058 --> 01:38:13,811
All right, then.
If you don't want it...

1193
01:38:15,229 --> 01:38:18,524
All right. What?

1194
01:38:19,608 --> 01:38:23,029
- Well, if you don't want it.
- What?

1195
01:38:28,034 --> 01:38:29,952
Oh, my God!

1196
01:38:31,579 --> 01:38:34,999
Oh, my God. It's beautiful!

1197
01:38:35,082 --> 01:38:37,918
It cost my savings,
but what the fuck?

1198
01:38:38,002 --> 01:38:40,921
Oh, God! Sid!

1199
01:38:42,423 --> 01:38:44,550
So...does this mean...

1200
01:38:44,634 --> 01:38:47,928
Yes, ma'am! That's what it means!

1201
01:38:48,554 --> 01:38:50,514
Oh, Sid!

1202
01:38:50,765 --> 01:38:52,725
Let's do it right now!

1203
01:38:52,808 --> 01:38:55,728
I wonder where we'll get stationed?

1204
01:38:55,811 --> 01:38:59,273
I've always wanted to go to Hawaii!

1205
01:38:59,357 --> 01:39:02,860
Honey, we're not being
stationed anywhere. I DOR'd.

1206
01:39:04,570 --> 01:39:07,073
- You what?
- I DOR'd.

1207
01:39:08,115 --> 01:39:10,660
I wasn't cut out to be a pilot.

1208
01:39:10,743 --> 01:39:14,455
I was faking it. I've been
faking everything up to now.

1209
01:39:16,582 --> 01:39:18,626
But...

1210
01:39:18,709 --> 01:39:21,170
What'll we do? Where would we go?

1211
01:39:21,796 --> 01:39:23,339
Oklahoma.

1212
01:39:23,422 --> 01:39:26,634
I'll get my old job
back at JC Penney's.

1213
01:39:26,717 --> 01:39:29,470
Hell, in two years,
I'll be floor manager.

1214
01:39:30,763 --> 01:39:35,184
You're going to love Oklahoma.
You and mama will get along great.

1215
01:39:35,267 --> 01:39:38,354
Money might be tight,
so we'll live at home.

1216
01:39:38,437 --> 01:39:40,272
It's going to work out.

1217
01:39:40,356 --> 01:39:43,317
Sid... There's no baby.

1218
01:39:45,945 --> 01:39:47,446
What?

1219
01:39:52,952 --> 01:39:54,662
I'm not pregnant.

1220
01:39:57,748 --> 01:39:59,875
I got my period this morning.

1221
01:40:00,584 --> 01:40:03,004
There's no baby, Sid.

1222
01:40:07,633 --> 01:40:09,510
I'll be goddamned.

1223
01:40:28,863 --> 01:40:32,450
What do you say
we get married anyway?

1224
01:40:32,533 --> 01:40:35,119
I love you!

1225
01:40:35,202 --> 01:40:39,165
I don't think I really knew
that till just now, just this second.

1226
01:40:40,207 --> 01:40:45,713
I have never been happier in my life
than I have in the last seven weeks.

1227
01:40:45,796 --> 01:40:47,840
I've never felt so relaxed,

1228
01:40:47,923 --> 01:40:51,886
and I've never felt so loved
for who I really am.

1229
01:41:02,980 --> 01:41:05,733
Lynette, marry me.

1230
01:41:05,816 --> 01:41:08,903
Make me the happiest man
in the whole world.

1231
01:41:20,164 --> 01:41:22,083
I'm sorry, Sid.

1232
01:41:22,166 --> 01:41:24,377
But I don't want to marry you.

1233
01:41:28,172 --> 01:41:30,132
I really like you,

1234
01:41:30,216 --> 01:41:33,427
and we've had ourselves
some really great times,

1235
01:41:33,511 --> 01:41:35,554
but I thought you understood.

1236
01:41:36,722 --> 01:41:38,933
I want to marry a pilot.

1237
01:41:39,016 --> 01:41:44,522
I want to live my life overseas...
the wife of an aviator!

1238
01:41:52,154 --> 01:41:53,698
Damn you!

1239
01:41:53,990 --> 01:41:55,491
Goddamn you!

1240
01:41:56,784 --> 01:42:00,329
Nobody DORs after 11 weeks!

1241
01:42:00,413 --> 01:42:02,373
Nobody!

1242
01:42:17,096 --> 01:42:20,599
Hi, ma'am.
Have you seen Paula around?

1243
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:23,769
Paula!

1244
01:42:26,397 --> 01:42:30,943
I'm looking for Sid. He DOR'd
and split. Nobody's seen him since.

1245
01:42:31,027 --> 01:42:33,612
I don't know where to look.

1246
01:43:00,389 --> 01:43:02,475
- Same room?
- Yes, sir.

1247
01:43:04,101 --> 01:43:06,270
Number three.

1248
01:43:06,354 --> 01:43:08,898
Yep. That's the one.

1249
01:43:10,399 --> 01:43:13,194
- What do you think of this?
- Looks nice.

1250
01:43:14,654 --> 01:43:17,281
Watch this. I think you'll like it.

1251
01:43:40,763 --> 01:43:42,181
Damn it!

1252
01:43:48,062 --> 01:43:49,563
Shit.

1253
01:44:05,287 --> 01:44:06,580
Lynette.

1254
01:44:08,416 --> 01:44:11,544
- Has Sid been here?
- Already come and gone.

1255
01:44:12,253 --> 01:44:13,671
What happened?

1256
01:44:13,754 --> 01:44:18,301
Can you believe it?
He DOR'd in the 12th week.

1257
01:44:20,011 --> 01:44:21,846
How can you win?

1258
01:44:27,018 --> 01:44:28,894
Lynette...

1259
01:44:30,479 --> 01:44:33,858
What did you tell him about the baby?

1260
01:44:33,941 --> 01:44:37,361
That there isn't one...as of today.

1261
01:44:40,114 --> 01:44:42,325
I got my period this morning.

1262
01:44:47,913 --> 01:44:53,127
I couldn't believe it.
He still wanted to marry me.

1263
01:44:54,337 --> 01:44:57,798
- What did you say?
- I said no, of course.

1264
01:44:57,882 --> 01:45:03,763
I don't want no Okie from Muskogee.
I can get that right here.

1265
01:45:03,846 --> 01:45:05,765
You little bitch.

1266
01:45:07,183 --> 01:45:12,146
Who do you think you are, playing
with people like that? He loves you!

1267
01:45:12,229 --> 01:45:14,065
You shit on him!

1268
01:45:15,524 --> 01:45:18,527
You made up everything, didn't you?
There wasn't any baby.

1269
01:45:18,611 --> 01:45:23,949
Of course there was a baby!
I'd never lie about that!

1270
01:45:25,785 --> 01:45:27,411
Would I, Paula?

1271
01:45:35,795 --> 01:45:37,630
You little cunt.

1272
01:45:43,052 --> 01:45:44,887
God help you.

1273
01:45:45,429 --> 01:45:48,099
You're no different than I am, Paula.

1274
01:45:48,182 --> 01:45:51,352
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not!

1275
01:46:10,454 --> 01:46:13,666
- Let me see if he's here, OK?
- All right.

1276
01:46:19,463 --> 01:46:22,008
Seen Sid Worley around here?

1277
01:46:23,384 --> 01:46:25,219
Yeah, he's here.

1278
01:46:40,026 --> 01:46:41,485
Sid.

1279
01:46:44,071 --> 01:46:46,657
Sid.

1280
01:46:46,741 --> 01:46:48,909
Guy said he just got here.

1281
01:46:51,704 --> 01:46:52,955
Sid.

1282
01:46:58,919 --> 01:47:00,212
Sid?

1283
01:47:02,590 --> 01:47:04,050
Hey, man.

1284
01:47:10,556 --> 01:47:12,391
Sid, you OK?

1285
01:47:15,770 --> 01:47:17,188
Sid.

1286
01:47:22,401 --> 01:47:23,986
Shit!

1287
01:47:26,113 --> 01:47:27,531
God.

1288
01:47:34,622 --> 01:47:36,082
Call an ambulance.

1289
01:47:44,048 --> 01:47:45,383
God.

1290
01:47:50,972 --> 01:47:52,473
Call an ambulance.

1291
01:47:56,435 --> 01:48:00,481
You dumb, fucking Okie.
I was your friend.

1292
01:48:03,901 --> 01:48:07,905
Why didn't you come
and talk to me about it?

1293
01:48:09,198 --> 01:48:11,242
You didn't even try.

1294
01:48:15,788 --> 01:48:18,749
You didn't even say goodbye to me.

1295
01:49:00,708 --> 01:49:04,837
The base Chaplain said
he'd call Sid's parents.

1296
01:49:04,920 --> 01:49:07,506
Why can't I learn?

1297
01:49:07,590 --> 01:49:10,676
Just like her all over again.
Just like her.

1298
01:49:10,760 --> 01:49:15,222
Zack, don't do this to yourself.
You didn't kill your mother.

1299
01:49:15,306 --> 01:49:18,809
You didn't kill Sid.
They killed themselves.

1300
01:49:20,978 --> 01:49:23,648
There's nothing
you could have done about it.

1301
01:49:23,731 --> 01:49:28,110
I got to leave.
Want money for a cab or something?

1302
01:49:28,194 --> 01:49:30,196
I don't deserve that.

1303
01:49:30,279 --> 01:49:31,697
OK. All right.

1304
01:49:31,781 --> 01:49:34,659
You're not the only one
that's feeling awful.

1305
01:49:34,742 --> 01:49:39,455
Maybe I had something to do with it.
I knew what Lynette was doing.

1306
01:49:39,538 --> 01:49:45,586
Look, you got no problems!
Another class will come through soon.

1307
01:49:45,670 --> 01:49:48,214
You and Lynette...
right back into business!

1308
01:49:48,297 --> 01:49:53,177
That's not fair. I never lied to you.
I never did what Lynette's doing.

1309
01:49:54,470 --> 01:49:56,347
- I'm not Lynette.
- No.

1310
01:49:57,390 --> 01:50:01,310
I love you.
I've loved you since I met you.

1311
01:50:02,061 --> 01:50:04,021
Don't you understand?

1312
01:50:06,232 --> 01:50:11,070
No! I don't want you to love me!
I don't want anyone to love me.

1313
01:50:11,153 --> 01:50:12,905
I just want out!

1314
01:50:17,159 --> 01:50:19,286
I don't know, but it's been said!

1315
01:50:21,622 --> 01:50:23,874
Air Force wings are made of lead!

1316
01:50:26,085 --> 01:50:29,505
Left, right, left, right,
column right.

1317
01:50:29,588 --> 01:50:31,132
Turn!

1318
01:50:31,215 --> 01:50:33,092
I don't know, but I've been told.

1319
01:50:35,344 --> 01:50:37,305
Navy wings are made of gold!

1320
01:50:39,724 --> 01:50:41,183
Platoon...

1321
01:50:41,267 --> 01:50:42,476
Halt!

1322
01:50:43,519 --> 01:50:48,816
Sir, this Officer Candidate requests
permission to speak in private, sir!

1323
01:50:48,899 --> 01:50:52,320
The whole class knows about Worley.
We're sorry.

1324
01:50:53,988 --> 01:50:58,576
I bet you are.
I want to see you in private, sir.

1325
01:50:58,659 --> 01:51:01,370
- Not now. I'm busy.
- Now!

1326
01:51:01,454 --> 01:51:04,123
- Forward...
- Sir, I request permission...

1327
01:51:04,206 --> 01:51:07,627
Right, left. Right, left.
Right, left...left...

1328
01:51:07,710 --> 01:51:12,214
Sir, this candidate requests
permission to see you in private!

1329
01:51:12,298 --> 01:51:16,010
- Sir!
- Not now. I'm busy. Get cleaned up.

1330
01:51:17,803 --> 01:51:22,308
I don't need your shit!
I came back to quit! DOR!

1331
01:51:22,391 --> 01:51:24,435
Platoon...halt!

1332
01:51:24,518 --> 01:51:28,147
I don't need you.
I don't need the Navy!

1333
01:51:28,230 --> 01:51:29,982
I don't need anybody.

1334
01:51:30,066 --> 01:51:32,652
OK, Mayo. I see what you want.

1335
01:51:33,778 --> 01:51:37,573
You said you wanted
to meet me in private?

1336
01:51:37,657 --> 01:51:41,118
You got it! The blimp hangar. Now!

1337
01:51:41,202 --> 01:51:43,829
- Move it!
- You move it.

1338
01:51:43,913 --> 01:51:46,958
We ain't going there to talk, boy.

1339
01:51:47,041 --> 01:51:48,209
Move!

1340
01:51:51,170 --> 01:51:52,380
Fall out.

1341
01:51:53,339 --> 01:51:56,008
Fall out! This is between me and him.

1342
01:52:36,424 --> 01:52:38,092
All right, Mayo.

1343
01:52:40,928 --> 01:52:42,805
Let's see what you got.

1344
01:52:45,141 --> 01:52:46,892
Quiet.

1345
01:52:52,398 --> 01:52:54,025
You've had training, Mayon...

1346
01:52:59,155 --> 01:53:02,283
- Come on, Foley.
- Lookie, lookie here.

1347
01:53:30,978 --> 01:53:34,148
Your blood's as red as mine,
isn't it, Mayo?

1348
01:53:47,203 --> 01:53:49,705
Come on, come on. Get up!

1349
01:54:12,228 --> 01:54:13,604
Holy!

1350
01:54:36,836 --> 01:54:39,213
You can quit now, if you want to.

1351
01:54:40,047 --> 01:54:41,924
It's up to you.

1352
01:55:14,123 --> 01:55:16,667
Sir, the officers are present.

1353
01:55:17,793 --> 01:55:19,170
Guests, please rise.

1354
01:55:21,339 --> 01:55:26,385
Class 1581, raise your right hand
and repeat after me.

1355
01:55:26,469 --> 01:55:28,304
"I do solemnly swear...

1356
01:55:30,389 --> 01:55:31,974
"that I will support and defend

1357
01:55:32,183 --> 01:55:34,560
"the constitution
of the United States of America...

1358
01:55:39,482 --> 01:55:42,151
"against all enemies,
foreign and domestic.

1359
01:55:45,071 --> 01:55:47,823
"That I will bear true faith
and allegiance to the same.

1360
01:55:50,368 --> 01:55:52,536
"That I take this
obligation freely...

1361
01:55:55,122 --> 01:55:58,209
"without any mental reservation
or purpose of evasion.

1362
01:56:01,295 --> 01:56:03,881
"That I will well
and faithfully discharge...

1363
01:56:06,467 --> 01:56:10,346
"the duties of office
I am about to enter.

1364
01:56:14,058 --> 01:56:15,643
"So help me God."

1365
01:56:17,436 --> 01:56:19,021
Please, be seated.

1366
01:56:21,273 --> 01:56:24,902
- Gunnery Sergeant Foley.
- Sir!

1367
01:56:28,948 --> 01:56:30,574
Well done, Sergeant.

1368
01:56:31,742 --> 01:56:33,703
Thank you, sir.

1369
01:56:46,549 --> 01:56:52,388
Class...1-5-8-1... Fall out!

1370
01:56:54,056 --> 01:56:55,349
Aye, aye, sir!

1371
01:56:57,018 --> 01:56:59,353
Foley's fire-eaters finally finished!

1372
01:57:12,658 --> 01:57:15,244
What did you think of that, babe?

1373
01:57:15,328 --> 01:57:17,622
I did it! What did you think?

1374
01:57:17,705 --> 01:57:19,707
See you at the saluting ceremony.

1375
01:57:20,041 --> 01:57:21,959
Come on. Meet my family.

1376
01:57:22,043 --> 01:57:24,670
No. I'm going to get my first salute.

1377
01:57:35,431 --> 01:57:37,475
Congratulations, Ensign Chadwick.

1378
01:57:45,441 --> 01:57:49,362
- Congratulations, Ensign Seeger.
- Thank you, sir.

1379
01:57:49,445 --> 01:57:51,781
Gunnery Sergeant Ensign Seeger...

1380
01:57:53,574 --> 01:57:55,159
sir.

1381
01:58:06,712 --> 01:58:08,214
Congratulations, Ensign Mayo.

1382
01:58:13,010 --> 01:58:16,639
- I won't ever forget you, Sergeant.
- I know.

1383
01:58:17,723 --> 01:58:21,477
I wouldn't have made this
if it weren't for you.

1384
01:58:21,560 --> 01:58:23,729
Get the hell out of here.

1385
01:58:25,439 --> 01:58:27,149
Thank you, Sergeant.

1386
01:58:36,450 --> 01:58:40,288
Congratulations,
Ensign Della Serra.

1387
01:58:40,371 --> 01:58:41,998
Thank you, Sergeant.

1388
01:58:56,387 --> 01:59:01,017
When I say, "Understand",
the group will say, "Yes, sir!"

1389
01:59:01,100 --> 01:59:02,977
- Understand?
- Yes, sir!

1390
01:59:03,060 --> 01:59:04,979
- Understand?
- Yes, sir!

1391
01:59:05,062 --> 01:59:08,941
I don't believe what I'm seeing!
Where you been?

1392
01:59:09,025 --> 01:59:10,693
Listening to punk rock music

1393
01:59:10,776 --> 01:59:13,237
and bad-mouthing your country,
I'll bet!

1394
01:59:14,238 --> 01:59:17,199
- Where you from, boy?
- Tucson, Arizona, sir.

1395
01:59:17,283 --> 01:59:19,410
- Where?
- Tucson, Arizona, sir!

1396
01:59:19,493 --> 01:59:24,290
Two things come out of Arizona...
steers and queers!

1397
01:59:24,373 --> 01:59:29,003
Which are you? I don't see no horns,
so you must be queer.

1398
01:59:29,086 --> 01:59:30,713
No, sir!

1399
01:59:34,383 --> 01:59:37,803
I will use every means necessary,
fair and unfair, to trip you up!

1400
01:59:54,236 --> 01:59:57,782
Turn it, Bunny.
No! Back the other way.

1401
01:59:57,865 --> 02:00:00,868
Keep going, keep going. Tilt it...

1402
02:01:08,561 --> 02:01:10,646
Way to go, Paula!

1403
02:01:12,064 --> 02:01:13,649
Way to go!
