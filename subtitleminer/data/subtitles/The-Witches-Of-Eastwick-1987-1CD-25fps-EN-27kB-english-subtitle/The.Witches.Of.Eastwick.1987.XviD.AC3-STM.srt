1
00:02:01,891 --> 00:02:04,963
You don't have to come
if you don't want to.

2
00:02:05,651 --> 00:02:08,927
I want to,
but I have a million things to do first.

3
00:02:16,211 --> 00:02:17,564
Mom, what's this?

4
00:02:18,531 --> 00:02:20,920
- Peanut butter.
- Peanut butter and what?

5
00:02:21,251 --> 00:02:22,730
Peanut butter and jelly.

6
00:02:22,811 --> 00:02:25,006
What kind of jelly?

7
00:02:25,451 --> 00:02:26,679
Zucchini jelly.

8
00:03:19,811 --> 00:03:20,960
How we doing?

9
00:03:21,051 --> 00:03:23,246
We're doing fine, Walter. Just fine.

10
00:03:24,131 --> 00:03:26,691
I wish we could afford
to keep you full time.

11
00:03:27,011 --> 00:03:29,081
So do I, especially now.

12
00:03:30,171 --> 00:03:32,366
Is the divorce final yet?

13
00:03:33,091 --> 00:03:35,161
Yes, today. Thank you.

14
00:03:35,971 --> 00:03:40,442
Let's put our heads together and
maybe we can work something out.

15
00:03:51,811 --> 00:03:53,085
Horns up.

16
00:03:53,571 --> 00:03:56,290
One, two, three, four...

17
00:04:54,891 --> 00:04:58,600
We appreciate your taking the time
to be here with us today.

18
00:04:59,811 --> 00:05:02,405
A big hand for our most
prominent selectman...

19
00:05:02,571 --> 00:05:06,644
...or selectwoman or selectperson,
Felicia Alden.

20
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:11,521
Thank you, children and Miss Spofford.

21
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:14,569
I can see we have our work cut out for us?

22
00:05:22,691 --> 00:05:25,683
In these days of disintegrating values...

23
00:05:26,331 --> 00:05:28,083
...and lost mores...

24
00:05:28,451 --> 00:05:31,090
...when our children are exposed daily...

25
00:05:31,171 --> 00:05:36,040
...to the hazards of divorce,
separation and families torn asunder...

26
00:05:36,891 --> 00:05:39,564
...it's comforting to think back
to the days...

27
00:05:39,611 --> 00:05:42,808
...when a family like the Lenox family
strove together.

28
00:05:42,851 --> 00:05:46,560
The values of that time,
embodied in a man like Major Lenox...

29
00:05:46,811 --> 00:05:50,486
They were men
who labored all their lives...

30
00:05:50,691 --> 00:05:54,923
...so their children would be well-fed,
clothed and educated.

31
00:05:55,731 --> 00:05:58,199
The families went through
great hardship...

32
00:06:00,811 --> 00:06:02,802
...yet kept their honor...

33
00:06:03,131 --> 00:06:05,850
...their dignity and their faith in God.

34
00:06:06,731 --> 00:06:10,804
We are the same people;
the same body, the soul...

35
00:06:12,131 --> 00:06:15,760
...the hands and the feet of our fathers...

36
00:06:16,091 --> 00:06:19,128
...fighting the wars of modern vice.

37
00:06:19,611 --> 00:06:22,489
What was it that tied
these people together?

38
00:06:22,811 --> 00:06:24,881
What was it that made them...

39
00:06:25,211 --> 00:06:28,920
...not a loose gathering of individuals,
but a single bond?

40
00:06:29,211 --> 00:06:30,200
That bond...

41
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:34,364
...that held them together,
as it holds us together today.

42
00:06:34,771 --> 00:06:37,331
That bond that has stood every test...

43
00:06:38,011 --> 00:06:40,241
...is found deep in our consciousness.

44
00:06:40,411 --> 00:06:42,971
An abiding love of liberty.

45
00:06:44,091 --> 00:06:47,163
For love of liberty, our forbears...

46
00:06:47,371 --> 00:06:50,966
...colonists few in number
and with little to defend themselves...

47
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:53,885
...fought the war for independence...

48
00:06:54,371 --> 00:06:57,920
...what was then the world's
most powerful empire.

49
00:06:58,691 --> 00:07:00,204
For love of liberty...

50
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:03,283
...those who came before us
tamed a vast wilderness...

51
00:07:03,371 --> 00:07:05,202
...and braved hardships...

52
00:07:07,131 --> 00:07:10,203
...tamed a vast wilderness
and braved hardships...

53
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:13,044
...which at times were beyond the limit...

54
00:07:17,091 --> 00:07:21,687
Braved hardships, which at times were
beyond the limit of human endurance.

55
00:07:32,851 --> 00:07:35,490
Come on. Go with your mom. Go on.

56
00:07:38,611 --> 00:07:43,127
Liberty must not be taken for granted.
We thank God for our blessings...

57
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,162
Do you believe it's raining?

58
00:08:20,251 --> 00:08:21,400
Duh!

59
00:08:21,531 --> 00:08:23,169
I mean, since this morning.

60
00:08:23,251 --> 00:08:24,479
At least it shut Walter up.

61
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:27,290
The same boring, sanctimonious speech.

62
00:08:29,011 --> 00:08:32,606
I thought he'd go on forever.
I was praying for something to happen.

63
00:08:32,691 --> 00:08:35,410
- I was thinking the exact same thing.
- You were?

64
00:08:35,771 --> 00:08:40,242
I was thinking we're all wet and
how nice it would be to just leave.

65
00:08:42,651 --> 00:08:44,130
And then it rained.

66
00:08:44,211 --> 00:08:48,204
- He's a liar and a lech and he deserved it.
- I'm not talking about Walter.

67
00:08:49,051 --> 00:08:51,042
Don't you think it's strange that we were...

68
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:54,282
We're thinking the same thing
at the same time? So what?

69
00:08:54,491 --> 00:08:56,607
It won't get us on David Letterman.

70
00:08:56,891 --> 00:08:58,324
Let's have a drink.

71
00:08:58,491 --> 00:09:01,210
Good idea, Janey, party-baby!

72
00:09:15,131 --> 00:09:17,281
He made a pass at me last week, too.

73
00:09:19,051 --> 00:09:20,803
I can't stand to think about it.

74
00:09:20,891 --> 00:09:23,325
Be prepared. He does not give up easily.

75
00:09:23,491 --> 00:09:27,245
It was broad daylight and his wife
was standing ten feet away!

76
00:09:27,411 --> 00:09:28,480
Poor woman.

77
00:09:28,611 --> 00:09:32,843
Poor woman, my ass. Why does she
put up with it? The man is a Nazi.

78
00:09:34,611 --> 00:09:37,000
Do you think they still... you know?

79
00:09:37,251 --> 00:09:38,445
- Yes.
- Really.

80
00:09:39,491 --> 00:09:41,721
I hope his dick is bigger than his I.Q.

81
00:09:41,811 --> 00:09:44,405
- Once a week. He told me.
- He told you.

82
00:09:44,811 --> 00:09:47,245
Otherwise she starts throwing things.

83
00:09:47,411 --> 00:09:49,879
At least someone's getting
something once a week.

84
00:09:49,971 --> 00:09:51,324
Yes, heartburn.

85
00:09:52,731 --> 00:09:55,564
I keep forgetting
how many calories are in these.

86
00:09:55,731 --> 00:09:56,880
Two minutes on the lips...

87
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,927
...forever on the love handles.

88
00:10:03,891 --> 00:10:05,768
And congratulations.

89
00:10:06,811 --> 00:10:07,846
Thank you.

90
00:10:07,931 --> 00:10:10,320
Oh, God, I forgot. Your divorce.

91
00:10:10,451 --> 00:10:12,726
As of today, I'm a free woman.

92
00:10:13,131 --> 00:10:14,769
- Join the club.
- Thanks.

93
00:10:17,811 --> 00:10:19,085
Here I go again.

94
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:22,680
It's over, honey. You'll be okay.

95
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:26,010
It's a beginning, not an ending.
Right, Alex?

96
00:10:26,371 --> 00:10:28,839
Besides, we still have each other.

97
00:10:28,931 --> 00:10:30,967
Have some more martooni.

98
00:10:31,571 --> 00:10:33,448
- Did you bring the cards?
- Was I supposed to?

99
00:10:33,531 --> 00:10:36,728
- I have them.
- Okay, come on ladies, let's do it!

100
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:42,759
I feel like I'm being unfaithful...

101
00:10:42,811 --> 00:10:44,881
...even if I just... think about it.

102
00:10:47,011 --> 00:10:49,969
Monty deserted you
and left you with five kids.

103
00:10:50,411 --> 00:10:52,049
- Six.
- Don't start, Alex.

104
00:10:52,211 --> 00:10:55,089
Her husband left
'cause she has too many kids.

105
00:10:55,171 --> 00:10:56,126
That's his problem.

106
00:10:56,211 --> 00:10:57,439
You're oversimplifying.

107
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:59,123
Yours left 'cause you can't have any.

108
00:10:59,211 --> 00:11:01,281
You are definitely oversimplifying.

109
00:11:01,491 --> 00:11:02,970
That's not the point.

110
00:11:03,171 --> 00:11:05,321
What I'm saying is that it's not your fault.

111
00:11:05,411 --> 00:11:08,562
That doesn't matter.
It's just not that easy.

112
00:11:08,731 --> 00:11:11,404
We're too young to lock it up
and throw away the key.

113
00:11:11,491 --> 00:11:12,924
It's not natural.

114
00:11:13,571 --> 00:11:15,607
What are we doing with ourselves?

115
00:11:15,811 --> 00:11:18,644
Look, Ozzie's dead. I loved him.
He's dead.

116
00:11:18,971 --> 00:11:22,759
So I spend Thursday nights
with you two the rest of my life?

117
00:11:22,811 --> 00:11:26,360
I like our Thursday nights.
It's the only time I can relax.

118
00:11:26,771 --> 00:11:30,161
Sure: Quilting, macrame.
What did we do last Thursday night?

119
00:11:30,331 --> 00:11:32,162
Chinese aphrodisiac cooking.

120
00:11:32,571 --> 00:11:35,165
Stimulating.
We're not relaxing, we're hiding.

121
00:11:35,451 --> 00:11:37,248
- What from?
- Walter Neff.

122
00:11:37,331 --> 00:11:40,368
Fuck Walter Neff.
I'm not talking about him.

123
00:11:42,851 --> 00:11:45,843
All right, who should we be looking for?

124
00:11:46,491 --> 00:11:49,324
Somebody nice. Somebody you could like.

125
00:11:49,651 --> 00:11:51,801
Somebody with a brain.
Somebody you could talk to.

126
00:11:51,891 --> 00:11:54,325
Somebody you could
really be yourself with.

127
00:11:54,411 --> 00:11:57,005
<i>Someone to watch</i>

128
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,928
<i>Over me.</i>

129
00:12:00,611 --> 00:12:03,045
All right, I've had it with you two.

130
00:12:07,411 --> 00:12:10,130
He would definitely have to be
from out of town.

131
00:12:10,331 --> 00:12:12,686
Especially considering what's in town.

132
00:12:12,891 --> 00:12:15,610
A stranger. That would be interesting.

133
00:12:16,451 --> 00:12:19,443
A tall, dark prince traveling under a curse.

134
00:12:19,811 --> 00:12:21,244
In Eastwick?

135
00:12:21,651 --> 00:12:23,164
Romantic.

136
00:12:23,411 --> 00:12:26,323
A foreign prince on a big, black horse.

137
00:12:31,091 --> 00:12:33,241
If we're going to have it...

138
00:12:34,131 --> 00:12:35,723
...let's have it all.

139
00:12:46,491 --> 00:12:48,641
Handsome.
He should be really handsome.

140
00:12:48,731 --> 00:12:50,130
Not too handsome.

141
00:12:50,331 --> 00:12:51,605
Nice eyes.

142
00:12:51,731 --> 00:12:52,846
Nice ass.

143
00:13:05,611 --> 00:13:06,964
Huge.

144
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:09,770
I prefer small.

145
00:13:11,011 --> 00:13:12,603
Aesthetically, I prefer small.

146
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:16,445
Sam was huge and there were times
when I could not face it.

147
00:13:16,611 --> 00:13:18,920
I'm in the middle myself.

148
00:13:19,011 --> 00:13:21,605
But who cares? As long as it works, it's in.

149
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:51,524
It's a nice thought,
but wishing for it won't make it happen.

150
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:56,765
Men are not the answer to everything.

151
00:13:59,651 --> 00:14:02,802
So why do we always end up
talking about them?

152
00:14:31,331 --> 00:14:34,004
I said, some man bought
the Lenox mansion.

153
00:14:36,091 --> 00:14:37,843
Did you hear me?

154
00:14:38,051 --> 00:14:39,769
<i>Yeah. Who is he?</i>

155
00:14:40,011 --> 00:14:42,844
He's from New York, no wife, no family.

156
00:14:43,131 --> 00:14:46,806
He told the realtors he needed
all that room for his pianos.

157
00:14:47,171 --> 00:14:49,287
Apparently, he had a lot of pianos.

158
00:14:49,491 --> 00:14:51,959
How many pianos can one guy have?

159
00:14:52,251 --> 00:14:55,766
Don't you think it's kind of...
strange and funny?

160
00:14:56,211 --> 00:14:57,610
<i>What's his name?</i>

161
00:14:58,411 --> 00:15:00,720
You know, that's strange, too.

162
00:15:02,411 --> 00:15:04,242
<i>What's strange about his name?</i>

163
00:15:04,331 --> 00:15:07,562
They told me his name
for the column and I forgot it.

164
00:15:07,731 --> 00:15:10,529
So I called back and it's gone again.

165
00:15:11,011 --> 00:15:13,206
It's not like me to forget a name.

166
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:16,208
<i>It's the big news of the day...</i>

167
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:20,170
<i>... considering the history of the place.</i>
<i>I wonder if he knows.</i>

168
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:21,519
I don't know.

169
00:15:22,731 --> 00:15:24,722
Is that Clyde and Felicia?

170
00:15:32,091 --> 00:15:34,127
I have the culinary piece.

171
00:15:35,651 --> 00:15:39,007
"Cheeseburger pie"?
Is your column finished?

172
00:15:39,491 --> 00:15:43,928
Here's the track meet, births and
deaths, the senior citizens' news.

173
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:48,603
The toxic waste article
should be done this afternoon.

174
00:15:48,771 --> 00:15:50,250
This pie looks good.

175
00:15:50,331 --> 00:15:52,925
Did you hear someone bought
the Lenox mansion.

176
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:09,766
The house is landmark building.
They have no right to sell it.

177
00:16:10,091 --> 00:16:12,400
I can't do anything about that.

178
00:16:15,131 --> 00:16:16,484
You're too busy...

179
00:16:16,571 --> 00:16:18,846
...reporting on the horse trough...

180
00:16:18,891 --> 00:16:21,405
...and Herbie Prescott's trip to Bermuda.

181
00:16:22,491 --> 00:16:26,609
What's going to happen
to those birds now? Tell me that.

182
00:16:26,851 --> 00:16:28,762
- What birds?
- The snowy egrets.

183
00:16:30,371 --> 00:16:31,884
Where will they nest?

184
00:16:31,971 --> 00:16:33,199
I don't know.

185
00:16:34,691 --> 00:16:35,840
Exactly.

186
00:16:37,251 --> 00:16:39,128
Felicia, what's the matter?

187
00:16:41,971 --> 00:16:44,246
It's only a house. Why are you so upset?

188
00:16:44,331 --> 00:16:45,844
I have a feeling.

189
00:16:46,211 --> 00:16:48,122
The most terrible feeling.

190
00:16:48,731 --> 00:16:51,609
Something is happening. Something evil.

191
00:16:59,371 --> 00:17:02,010
I'm just glad they're selling.
I was starting to think...

192
00:17:02,091 --> 00:17:04,730
They're not selling, they sold.
Just like that.

193
00:17:05,131 --> 00:17:06,325
I don't understand.

194
00:17:06,411 --> 00:17:10,723
You know I adore the little creatures.
So unreal, and yet the detail.

195
00:17:11,051 --> 00:17:15,681
Little fingers and toes, little pudenda
making a bump. So sweet.

196
00:17:16,011 --> 00:17:19,367
But nobody's even looked
at them sideways in months.

197
00:17:19,691 --> 00:17:21,249
Then this morning...

198
00:17:21,611 --> 00:17:25,126
...this man appeared
out of absolutely nowhere.

199
00:17:25,251 --> 00:17:29,369
So charming.
Not really handsome, but... riveting.

200
00:17:29,771 --> 00:17:33,127
That's it. I was riveted.
I looked into his eyes...

201
00:17:33,771 --> 00:17:37,002
...and had thoughts I hadn't entertained
since World War II.

202
00:17:37,091 --> 00:17:39,127
I actually... blushed.

203
00:17:39,411 --> 00:17:40,321
Can you imagine?

204
00:17:40,411 --> 00:17:42,641
No, I mean, yeah. So he bought one?

205
00:17:43,211 --> 00:17:45,600
He bought all of them. Every single one.

206
00:17:46,091 --> 00:17:47,410
So who was he? A tourist?

207
00:17:47,491 --> 00:17:50,881
No, he just bought the Lenox house.
He's moving in.

208
00:17:51,691 --> 00:17:53,443
Do you remember his name?

209
00:17:53,611 --> 00:17:55,329
Of course. His name is...

210
00:17:59,531 --> 00:18:00,964
He told me.

211
00:18:01,611 --> 00:18:03,363
I wrote it down.

212
00:18:04,491 --> 00:18:05,526
It was...

213
00:18:06,091 --> 00:18:07,319
...foreign.

214
00:18:08,651 --> 00:18:10,084
It sounded, uh...

215
00:18:11,251 --> 00:18:14,766
It's right on the tip of my tongue,
but I can't...

216
00:18:19,051 --> 00:18:20,803
Isn't that diabolical?

217
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:13,603
What is that noise?

218
00:19:15,811 --> 00:19:17,449
I don't know.

219
00:20:16,571 --> 00:20:18,368
Bravis!

220
00:20:27,171 --> 00:20:29,082
He bought all of them?

221
00:20:29,131 --> 00:20:31,929
- And now he's here.
- Making goo-goo eyes at Jane.

222
00:20:31,971 --> 00:20:34,360
And the interview, too. How weird.

223
00:20:34,571 --> 00:20:38,325
Didn't I tell you?
Oh, it was after we talked.

224
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:41,608
The paper called him
and asked to interview him...

225
00:20:42,731 --> 00:20:44,961
About the house renovation and all.

226
00:20:45,011 --> 00:20:48,048
He said he'd love to be interviewed
and asked for me.

227
00:20:49,131 --> 00:20:51,884
I don't know why he wants me
to do the interview.

228
00:20:52,171 --> 00:20:54,639
- Who is he?
- He must have a name.

229
00:20:54,811 --> 00:20:56,483
I just can't remember it.

230
00:20:56,731 --> 00:20:58,403
Why would he ask for you?

231
00:20:58,691 --> 00:21:02,843
Because I'm good at it.
You act like I'm so stupid.

232
00:21:03,371 --> 00:21:05,123
He was in my shop.

233
00:21:05,411 --> 00:21:08,608
You're not stupid. But how does he know
who Sukie Ridgemont is?

234
00:21:08,691 --> 00:21:09,840
I don't know.

235
00:21:10,131 --> 00:21:12,850
He bought the Lenox estate just like that.

236
00:21:13,411 --> 00:21:15,971
He has some kind of a foreign name.

237
00:21:16,371 --> 00:21:18,441
Van something or other.

238
00:21:23,531 --> 00:21:25,123
How sweet.

239
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:28,170
They're from him. With a personal note.

240
00:21:28,931 --> 00:21:29,966
Just "D."

241
00:21:30,051 --> 00:21:31,769
Yeah, it starts with a "D."

242
00:21:31,851 --> 00:21:32,761
David?

243
00:21:32,971 --> 00:21:35,929
No. It has an "R" in it.

244
00:21:36,051 --> 00:21:37,086
Doberman?

245
00:21:37,571 --> 00:21:38,799
- Drake?
- Darren.

246
00:21:38,891 --> 00:21:42,361
It's "D" something, "R" something, "L."
Daryl!

247
00:21:45,091 --> 00:21:46,319
Van Horne.

248
00:21:46,731 --> 00:21:48,164
Daryl Van Horne.

249
00:21:48,491 --> 00:21:50,402
What kind of a name is that?

250
00:22:12,931 --> 00:22:14,523
Oh, Clyde, honey.

251
00:22:15,851 --> 00:22:17,762
I think I broke my leg.

252
00:23:08,331 --> 00:23:09,923
Looking for me?

253
00:23:12,331 --> 00:23:16,643
Are you looking for me?
Or is this just a happy coincidence?

254
00:23:16,971 --> 00:23:19,360
- Actually, I was...
- Just looking.

255
00:23:19,691 --> 00:23:21,761
Well, too bad.

256
00:23:22,091 --> 00:23:25,367
Have you seen any snowy egrets out here?

257
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:27,845
Neither have I.

258
00:23:28,091 --> 00:23:32,767
Not that I'd know a snowy egret if I was
pissing on one. You want some lunch?

259
00:23:33,931 --> 00:23:36,320
I think it's a little late in the season.

260
00:23:38,091 --> 00:23:39,001
For lunch?

261
00:23:39,091 --> 00:23:40,604
For pissing on birds.

262
00:23:49,611 --> 00:23:52,205
The local sculptress. The one who makes...

263
00:23:52,331 --> 00:23:54,083
...the booby dolls.

264
00:23:54,411 --> 00:23:55,924
They're just little...

265
00:23:56,331 --> 00:23:58,765
But... potent. Full of juice.

266
00:24:00,571 --> 00:24:04,007
Potent. You can feel it
when you pick them up.

267
00:24:04,171 --> 00:24:06,127
I sent a couple to New York.

268
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:09,681
I have a friend down there. Terrific fellow.

269
00:24:09,931 --> 00:24:13,128
He has a gallery.
I wanted to hear his opinion.

270
00:24:13,531 --> 00:24:16,329
Of course the scale is wrong. Get bigger.

271
00:24:16,411 --> 00:24:19,130
Let yourself go. Get some size into it.

272
00:24:20,731 --> 00:24:24,246
Do you like fish?
We're having fish for lunch.

273
00:24:43,211 --> 00:24:44,644
Interesting, huh?

274
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:48,162
Fidel, that's his name.

275
00:24:48,531 --> 00:24:51,250
Women love him. They're crazy about him.

276
00:24:52,011 --> 00:24:54,081
He has a big schlong.

277
00:24:54,491 --> 00:24:55,367
Huge.

278
00:24:55,611 --> 00:24:58,648
Well, there you are. Scale again. Size.

279
00:24:59,371 --> 00:25:01,931
Who knows, maybe it's a masculine thing.

280
00:25:01,971 --> 00:25:06,681
They say women don't care.
I'm in the middle myself. How about you?

281
00:25:07,771 --> 00:25:09,363
How about me, what?

282
00:25:09,451 --> 00:25:12,648
See, women are in touch
with different things.

283
00:25:12,891 --> 00:25:17,521
That's my opinion. It's not
a fashionable one right now, but fuck it!

284
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:22,329
I see men running around,
putting their dicks...

285
00:25:22,531 --> 00:25:25,284
...into everything,
trying to make something happen.

286
00:25:25,371 --> 00:25:29,205
But it's women who are the source,
the only power.

287
00:25:29,691 --> 00:25:31,921
Nature. Birth. Rebirth.

288
00:25:32,291 --> 00:25:34,202
Cliche. Cliche.

289
00:25:34,691 --> 00:25:36,602
Sure. But true.

290
00:25:37,451 --> 00:25:39,282
Why are you telling me this?

291
00:25:40,411 --> 00:25:43,448
You're an honest woman.
I'm being honest with you.

292
00:25:43,611 --> 00:25:46,171
I like women. I admire them.

293
00:25:47,051 --> 00:25:51,203
But if you want me to treat you
like a dumb twit, I will.

294
00:25:51,531 --> 00:25:53,681
But what for? You have brains.

295
00:25:54,731 --> 00:25:58,326
More than brains. But you don't know it.
Most women don't.

296
00:25:59,251 --> 00:26:00,570
Are you married?

297
00:26:00,651 --> 00:26:01,845
Good question!

298
00:26:01,891 --> 00:26:03,961
You see? Brains.

299
00:26:04,651 --> 00:26:07,529
The answer is no. I don't believe in it.

300
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:10,251
Good for the man. Lousy for the woman.

301
00:26:10,731 --> 00:26:14,485
She dies. She suffocates. I've seen it.

302
00:26:14,651 --> 00:26:18,485
Then the husband complains to everyone
that he's fucking a dead person.

303
00:26:18,851 --> 00:26:20,887
And he's the one who killed her.

304
00:26:23,371 --> 00:26:25,282
- Where is your husband?
- Dead.

305
00:26:25,611 --> 00:26:28,648
Sorry, but you're one of the lucky ones.

306
00:26:28,971 --> 00:26:32,964
When a woman unloads a husband
or a husband unloads a woman...

307
00:26:33,131 --> 00:26:36,806
...however it happens:
Death, desertion, divorce...

308
00:26:37,611 --> 00:26:41,684
When that happens, a woman blooms.
She blossoms.

309
00:26:42,451 --> 00:26:45,170
Like flowers. Like fruit.

310
00:26:45,811 --> 00:26:47,085
She is ripe.

311
00:26:48,051 --> 00:26:50,281
That's the woman for me.

312
00:26:57,771 --> 00:27:00,001
Would you like to see my house?

313
00:27:03,851 --> 00:27:05,921
In case anybody ever...

314
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:08,161
...needed any exercise...

315
00:27:08,651 --> 00:27:12,326
...the pool is right over there,
past the piano...

316
00:27:12,371 --> 00:27:14,760
...where the ballroom used to be.

317
00:27:15,211 --> 00:27:17,441
Interesting word..."ballroom."

318
00:27:17,931 --> 00:27:19,125
It's one of my favorites.

319
00:27:19,211 --> 00:27:21,122
Over there is, uh...

320
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:23,523
...my study.

321
00:27:28,651 --> 00:27:31,211
- This is my bedroom.
- Yes, it is.

322
00:27:31,451 --> 00:27:33,840
The Borgias once owned the bed.

323
00:27:34,891 --> 00:27:39,203
Of course, you have to pay for it
with your soul, but...

324
00:27:39,731 --> 00:27:42,404
...what the hell, I deserve a little luxury.

325
00:27:42,731 --> 00:27:44,961
You have to take care of yourself.

326
00:27:45,011 --> 00:27:47,650
No one will do that for you, will they?

327
00:27:55,091 --> 00:27:57,207
What do you think you're doing?

328
00:27:58,731 --> 00:28:03,043
Being as direct with you as I know how.
I thought you'd appreciate it.

329
00:28:05,211 --> 00:28:08,726
I always like a little pussy after lunch.
What do you say?

330
00:28:10,891 --> 00:28:12,722
Are you trying to seduce me?

331
00:28:12,971 --> 00:28:16,486
I wouldn't dream of seducing you,
Alexandra.

332
00:28:16,651 --> 00:28:18,881
I wouldn't insult your intelligence...

333
00:28:19,051 --> 00:28:22,088
...with anything as trivial as seduction.

334
00:28:22,731 --> 00:28:25,609
But, I would love to fuck you.

335
00:28:30,251 --> 00:28:33,880
I have to admit that I appreciate
your directness, Daryl.

336
00:28:34,451 --> 00:28:35,930
I will try to be as direct...

337
00:28:36,011 --> 00:28:38,366
...and honest with you as I possibly can be.

338
00:28:38,451 --> 00:28:39,566
I think...

339
00:28:40,651 --> 00:28:45,361
No, I am positive that you are the most
unattractive man I have ever met...

340
00:28:45,611 --> 00:28:47,090
...in my entire life.

341
00:28:47,171 --> 00:28:52,165
This afternoon, you have demonstrated
every loathsome characteristic...

342
00:28:52,251 --> 00:28:55,163
...of the male personality
and even discovered some new ones.

343
00:28:55,251 --> 00:28:58,368
You are physically repulsive,
intellectually retarded...

344
00:28:58,651 --> 00:29:03,281
...morally reprehensible, vulgar,
insensitive, selfish, stupid.

345
00:29:03,571 --> 00:29:06,608
You have no taste,
no sense of humor and you smell.

346
00:29:07,051 --> 00:29:09,929
You're not even interesting enough
to make me sick.

347
00:29:12,651 --> 00:29:15,529
Would you like to be
on top or the bottom?

348
00:29:17,291 --> 00:29:20,488
Good-bye Daryl,
and thank you for a lovely lunch.

349
00:29:20,811 --> 00:29:23,530
If that's the way you feel about it...

350
00:29:23,851 --> 00:29:26,126
...that's the way you feel about it.

351
00:29:26,411 --> 00:29:28,481
Is that the way you feel about it?

352
00:29:34,651 --> 00:29:35,879
Who are you?

353
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:38,970
Just your...

354
00:29:39,211 --> 00:29:41,441
...average horny little devil.

355
00:29:43,051 --> 00:29:44,530
I have to get home.

356
00:29:45,131 --> 00:29:47,520
What have you got to go home to?

357
00:29:47,611 --> 00:29:50,000
There isn't anybody there, is there?

358
00:29:50,571 --> 00:29:52,641
The kid will take care of herself.

359
00:29:53,131 --> 00:29:56,965
She'll eat and fall asleep
on the bed doing homework.

360
00:29:57,291 --> 00:29:58,883
I promise.

361
00:29:59,691 --> 00:30:01,443
And house cleaning.

362
00:30:01,771 --> 00:30:05,286
You clean up the dirt,
there's just more dirt tomorrow.

363
00:30:05,611 --> 00:30:08,808
Make the beds,
they just have to be made tomorrow.

364
00:30:08,891 --> 00:30:11,928
Wash the dishes.
There's more to wash tomorrow.

365
00:30:12,371 --> 00:30:14,282
- I have to make...
- Make dinner?

366
00:30:14,571 --> 00:30:16,163
It just gets eaten.

367
00:30:16,491 --> 00:30:18,322
You've done your best, Alex.

368
00:30:18,571 --> 00:30:22,246
You've done the wife bit,
the motherhood bit.

369
00:30:22,291 --> 00:30:25,328
The car pools, the vegetable garden...

370
00:30:25,771 --> 00:30:28,808
...needlepoint, the macrame potholders...

371
00:30:29,171 --> 00:30:32,083
...a cup of coffee with a neighbor
in the morning...

372
00:30:32,491 --> 00:30:36,166
...a couple of drinks, a couple of pills...

373
00:30:36,731 --> 00:30:38,961
...a little psychoanalysis...

374
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:41,763
Where are you now, Alex?

375
00:30:42,091 --> 00:30:44,651
Exactly where I want to be
and I'm doing fine.

376
00:30:44,771 --> 00:30:49,401
Pretending to be somebody else...
to be half of what you are.

377
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:52,320
How long can you last like that?

378
00:30:53,131 --> 00:30:55,929
The world keeps growing, and you feed it.

379
00:30:56,531 --> 00:30:58,647
But it doesn't feed you, does it?

380
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:02,121
It washes through you,
down the drain, wasted.

381
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:05,171
A woman is a hole,
isn't that what they say?

382
00:31:05,451 --> 00:31:08,807
All the futility of the world
pouring into her.

383
00:31:11,851 --> 00:31:15,844
How much can you take, Alex?
How much can you take...

384
00:31:16,331 --> 00:31:17,923
...before you snap?

385
00:31:19,851 --> 00:31:23,207
Lying on your bed, looking at the ceiling...

386
00:31:23,411 --> 00:31:25,288
...waiting for something to happen.

387
00:31:25,371 --> 00:31:29,842
And knowing all the time you
were meant for something better.

388
00:31:30,411 --> 00:31:32,003
Feeling it.

389
00:31:32,091 --> 00:31:33,683
Wanting it.

390
00:31:34,931 --> 00:31:36,569
Use me, Alex.

391
00:31:37,611 --> 00:31:38,885
Use me.

392
00:31:39,371 --> 00:31:41,601
Fill me up. I can take it.

393
00:31:41,811 --> 00:31:44,200
Make it happen. Don't wait.

394
00:31:45,291 --> 00:31:46,883
Time is the killer.

395
00:31:47,731 --> 00:31:49,289
Make it happen.

396
00:31:50,251 --> 00:31:52,003
Do it, Alex.

397
00:31:52,491 --> 00:31:53,924
Do it now.

398
00:32:50,091 --> 00:32:52,002
You sit there in that...

399
00:32:53,051 --> 00:32:55,440
...pathetic excuse of an office...

400
00:32:57,291 --> 00:32:58,883
...reporting gossip...

401
00:33:02,691 --> 00:33:04,761
...while under your very nose...

402
00:33:05,611 --> 00:33:06,885
...evil...

403
00:33:08,011 --> 00:33:09,922
...is doing its worst.

404
00:33:14,251 --> 00:33:16,003
You have no spine, Clyde.

405
00:33:17,851 --> 00:33:19,921
Not one ounce...

406
00:33:20,531 --> 00:33:21,759
...of morality.

407
00:33:22,891 --> 00:33:24,165
Christ!

408
00:33:24,651 --> 00:33:26,562
Even common sense.

409
00:33:28,891 --> 00:33:30,449
Nuclear holocaust.

410
00:33:30,731 --> 00:33:32,005
Murder.

411
00:33:32,171 --> 00:33:34,366
Rape. Apartheid!

412
00:33:35,691 --> 00:33:38,251
Why, these words mean nothing to you.

413
00:33:40,171 --> 00:33:42,082
It's just a local newspaper.

414
00:33:42,411 --> 00:33:44,163
It is local turpitude.

415
00:33:44,251 --> 00:33:48,244
You are a failure, Clyde!
You should be strung up...

416
00:33:48,291 --> 00:33:51,363
...along with that son of a bitch
who bought that house!

417
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:56,001
Call the nurse!

418
00:34:04,451 --> 00:34:05,770
I am in pain!

419
00:34:06,251 --> 00:34:08,970
- Then take the pill.
- I don't want to.

420
00:34:09,131 --> 00:34:11,520
I'm not going to force it on you.

421
00:34:12,691 --> 00:34:14,602
Is it Alzheimer's?

422
00:34:16,331 --> 00:34:19,050
It's the bone marrow.
When a bone breaks...

423
00:34:19,371 --> 00:34:23,683
...bits of fat get in the bloodstream
and the blood vessels of the brain.

424
00:34:24,011 --> 00:34:25,649
It affects the behavior.

425
00:34:25,731 --> 00:34:29,929
She's hysterical. She says things that
I don't know where they're coming from.

426
00:34:30,131 --> 00:34:31,200
It's the bone marrow?

427
00:34:31,291 --> 00:34:35,330
Yes. She'll be very upset.
She'll say terrible things.

428
00:34:35,851 --> 00:34:38,001
She may even be paranoid.

429
00:34:38,091 --> 00:34:40,810
It is perfectly normal. It will pass.

430
00:34:58,731 --> 00:35:00,642
What's happening to me, Clyde?

431
00:35:00,811 --> 00:35:02,563
It's all right, sweetheart.

432
00:35:05,771 --> 00:35:08,808
I open my mouth
and the strangest things come out.

433
00:35:10,651 --> 00:35:14,963
You've had a hard time and you're tired.
Try to sleep.

434
00:35:29,251 --> 00:35:31,481
Something is inside me, Clyde.

435
00:35:33,971 --> 00:35:36,360
Something is crawling inside me.

436
00:35:37,811 --> 00:35:39,005
I can feel it.

437
00:35:39,171 --> 00:35:40,445
Something evil.

438
00:35:41,571 --> 00:35:43,323
It's almost here.

439
00:35:46,531 --> 00:35:48,089
You!

440
00:35:48,451 --> 00:35:49,884
In there!

441
00:36:46,051 --> 00:36:47,643
At last we meet.

442
00:36:48,451 --> 00:36:50,043
Daryl Van Horne.

443
00:37:02,051 --> 00:37:03,325
Cream and sugar?

444
00:37:03,531 --> 00:37:04,759
Sugar.

445
00:37:05,451 --> 00:37:07,681
- One lump or two?
- Four.

446
00:37:08,491 --> 00:37:10,721
- Sweet tooth.
- Sweet everything.

447
00:37:10,851 --> 00:37:14,844
I'm a sugar junkie.
Sugar, chocolate, Coca-Cola...

448
00:37:15,531 --> 00:37:19,206
Uncontrollable appetite...
in every department.

449
00:37:21,451 --> 00:37:23,169
That's not good for you.

450
00:37:27,691 --> 00:37:29,283
It doesn't bother me.

451
00:37:29,611 --> 00:37:32,967
I have a supernatural constitution.
It's genetic.

452
00:37:33,571 --> 00:37:36,290
I don't hold on
this health consciousness shit.

453
00:37:36,651 --> 00:37:38,084
Pardon the language.

454
00:37:38,171 --> 00:37:39,923
I see guys, 60...

455
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:42,361
...70, breaking their balls...

456
00:37:43,051 --> 00:37:45,281
...to stay fit. What for?

457
00:37:45,611 --> 00:37:48,444
When I die, I want to be sick, not healthy.

458
00:37:49,291 --> 00:37:52,010
I suppose that's one way of looking at it.

459
00:37:55,051 --> 00:37:56,279
Do I make you nervous?

460
00:37:56,371 --> 00:37:57,645
Yes, you do!

461
00:37:58,091 --> 00:38:00,480
I'm sorry. I don't know why I said that.

462
00:38:01,611 --> 00:38:03,363
Truth is best.

463
00:38:04,171 --> 00:38:05,923
Yes, that's so true.

464
00:38:17,611 --> 00:38:19,522
So what brings you to Eastwick?

465
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:24,559
We're going to have a polite conversation.

466
00:38:24,771 --> 00:38:25,886
I'm sorry.

467
00:38:26,091 --> 00:38:27,683
No, I don't mind.

468
00:38:27,731 --> 00:38:31,326
I came to Eastwick
because I was drawn here.

469
00:38:32,331 --> 00:38:34,891
I needed a place to settle down and...

470
00:38:36,171 --> 00:38:37,729
...I liked the house.

471
00:38:38,731 --> 00:38:40,130
It has a history.

472
00:38:41,091 --> 00:38:42,046
Rubbish.

473
00:38:42,571 --> 00:38:44,163
No, it's true.

474
00:38:45,131 --> 00:38:47,850
They say they used to burn witches there.

475
00:38:49,131 --> 00:38:50,883
Hocus pocus.

476
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:53,282
The entire witchcraft scare...

477
00:38:53,771 --> 00:38:58,367
...as far back as the 14th century,
was started by the medical profession.

478
00:39:00,251 --> 00:39:01,764
They were trying to get the midwives...

479
00:39:01,851 --> 00:39:04,081
...out of the childbirthing business.

480
00:39:04,331 --> 00:39:08,483
That's what most of the women
they burned were. Midwives.

481
00:39:09,091 --> 00:39:10,285
Is that true?

482
00:39:11,211 --> 00:39:12,803
You better believe it.

483
00:39:12,971 --> 00:39:17,123
Just another example of male-dominated
professional society...

484
00:39:17,411 --> 00:39:21,404
...exploiting females
for their own selfish purposes.

485
00:39:22,251 --> 00:39:24,765
Men are such cocksuckers, aren't they?

486
00:39:27,691 --> 00:39:30,569
You don't have to answer that. It's true.

487
00:39:31,171 --> 00:39:33,401
Their dicks get limp...

488
00:39:33,451 --> 00:39:36,443
...when confronted by a powerful woman,
so what do they do?

489
00:39:36,531 --> 00:39:39,329
Call them witches.
Burn them, torture them...

490
00:39:39,691 --> 00:39:43,047
...until every woman is afraid.
Afraid of herself...

491
00:39:44,171 --> 00:39:45,923
...afraid of men.

492
00:39:46,251 --> 00:39:48,003
And all for what?

493
00:39:49,251 --> 00:39:51,481
Fear of losing their hard-on.

494
00:39:55,811 --> 00:39:57,529
Let's play some music.

495
00:40:33,451 --> 00:40:35,362
You play beautifully.

496
00:40:36,171 --> 00:40:38,241
Nothing compared to you.

497
00:40:38,571 --> 00:40:40,323
You're an artist.

498
00:40:40,491 --> 00:40:41,765
Intonation.

499
00:40:42,171 --> 00:40:44,287
Vibrato. Stretch.

500
00:40:44,811 --> 00:40:47,689
You think I'm crazy, but I know music.

501
00:40:48,011 --> 00:40:50,809
It's the one thing that makes me humble.

502
00:40:51,371 --> 00:40:54,408
Not prissy?
Our leader says my intonation is prissy.

503
00:40:54,491 --> 00:40:56,402
You have precision.

504
00:40:57,571 --> 00:41:02,042
Precision is not prissy.
Precision is the foundation of passion.

505
00:41:02,531 --> 00:41:05,409
Passion without precision... chaos.

506
00:41:06,011 --> 00:41:09,686
Look at your thumb.
Your sublime thumb position.

507
00:41:09,931 --> 00:41:12,161
You really keep the pressure on.

508
00:41:12,331 --> 00:41:14,561
Most men can't, but you...

509
00:41:15,131 --> 00:41:17,850
You have the most beautiful callus.

510
00:41:18,891 --> 00:41:20,483
This hand...

511
00:41:22,091 --> 00:41:25,447
This is your failure. Your bowing sucks.

512
00:41:27,211 --> 00:41:28,803
My bowing? Why?

513
00:41:31,611 --> 00:41:35,445
Your spiccato sounds like marcato.
Your legato like detache.

514
00:41:35,691 --> 00:41:40,003
You kill the passion. Let it go.
Why are you holding back?

515
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:42,765
These aren't just notes you're playing...

516
00:41:42,891 --> 00:41:45,610
...they're phrases. Human outcries.

517
00:41:45,771 --> 00:41:48,160
I understand that! And I practice!

518
00:41:48,651 --> 00:41:50,960
I practice until my fingers bleed!

519
00:41:52,011 --> 00:41:53,524
I know.

520
00:41:53,771 --> 00:41:56,808
It's the sixteenth notes in the allegro.
I can't do it!

521
00:41:57,131 --> 00:41:58,564
Yes, you can.

522
00:41:59,691 --> 00:42:01,204
It's no good.

523
00:42:04,811 --> 00:42:06,244
I don't have it.

524
00:42:06,491 --> 00:42:07,685
I can't do it.

525
00:42:07,931 --> 00:42:09,444
Yes, you can.

526
00:42:15,851 --> 00:42:17,125
Trust me.

527
00:42:18,011 --> 00:42:19,285
Trust me.

528
00:42:31,051 --> 00:42:32,484
Try it.

529
00:42:33,771 --> 00:42:35,204
Try it.

530
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:37,603
Let it go. What are you afraid of?

531
00:42:37,691 --> 00:42:40,569
You have great passion in you. Let it out!

532
00:42:41,131 --> 00:42:42,883
I can take it.

533
00:42:43,211 --> 00:42:44,644
I want it!

534
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:01,407
Yes, that's it.

535
00:43:04,971 --> 00:43:06,723
Breathe into it.

536
00:43:07,051 --> 00:43:08,962
Don't tighten up.

537
00:43:10,651 --> 00:43:12,721
Feel it. Hold it. Love it!

538
00:43:13,131 --> 00:43:14,405
That's it.

539
00:43:14,731 --> 00:43:16,244
That's right. Now!

540
00:43:24,731 --> 00:43:26,801
That's right. Do you feel that?

541
00:43:27,091 --> 00:43:29,651
Let it wash over you. Let it tickle you.

542
00:44:44,171 --> 00:44:45,604
Did you miss me?

543
00:44:49,291 --> 00:44:51,680
Do you want to listen to some tapes?

544
00:44:56,171 --> 00:44:57,763
I'm out here!

545
00:45:00,011 --> 00:45:01,524
- Let's go.
- What is that?

546
00:45:01,611 --> 00:45:05,604
We're going to be late.
Carol, the number is on the fridge!

547
00:45:06,411 --> 00:45:09,289
- But you're not dressed.
- I'm not naked.

548
00:45:11,451 --> 00:45:13,521
- I don't believe it!
- Neither do I!

549
00:45:13,691 --> 00:45:16,569
But I swear to God,
I couldn't walk for two days.

550
00:45:18,411 --> 00:45:21,130
His penis is amazing.
It bends the wrong way.

551
00:45:21,171 --> 00:45:23,241
The wrong...? Wait a minute!

552
00:45:23,691 --> 00:45:25,283
It bends like that!

553
00:45:25,531 --> 00:45:27,761
- You're terrible.
- No, I'm fabulous!

554
00:45:28,931 --> 00:45:31,126
But just because you went
to bed with him...

555
00:45:31,211 --> 00:45:34,248
No, it's not just that!
It's like he knows me.

556
00:45:34,491 --> 00:45:38,325
He knows everything!
I can't wait for you to meet him.

557
00:45:38,571 --> 00:45:42,883
And I can't wait for Jane to meet him!
Jane will love him!

558
00:45:50,491 --> 00:45:51,606
Is that you?

559
00:45:55,211 --> 00:45:57,281
Did you come to fix the plumbing?

560
00:45:57,531 --> 00:46:00,728
I didn't have time to change.
What's your excuse?

561
00:46:00,811 --> 00:46:02,802
I don't need one. I was invited.

562
00:46:02,891 --> 00:46:04,006
So was I.

563
00:46:06,251 --> 00:46:07,525
Darling!

564
00:46:08,651 --> 00:46:10,403
- Are we late?
- Not at all.

565
00:46:10,571 --> 00:46:12,050
Weren't we playing singles?

566
00:46:12,131 --> 00:46:14,440
- You don't play tennis.
- I do now.

567
00:46:15,691 --> 00:46:17,283
At last we meet.

568
00:46:20,171 --> 00:46:21,763
Let me...

569
00:46:22,371 --> 00:46:24,931
...Iook at those eyes of yours.

570
00:46:26,251 --> 00:46:28,811
You are a fertile creature, aren't you?

571
00:46:29,131 --> 00:46:30,280
Thank you, I think.

572
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:33,807
I'm reading that rag of a newspaper.
You are a genius.

573
00:46:34,411 --> 00:46:37,289
Wasted. Pearls before swine.

574
00:46:38,251 --> 00:46:42,085
When are we going to do our interview?
I love interviews.

575
00:46:43,211 --> 00:46:45,441
- They're so intimate.
- Anytime you say.

576
00:46:45,491 --> 00:46:48,847
Just the two of us,
banging away, head to head.

577
00:46:52,171 --> 00:46:53,365
But not today.

578
00:46:53,491 --> 00:46:56,324
Today is for tennis. Are you ready, ladies?

579
00:47:01,291 --> 00:47:02,883
What a day!

580
00:47:04,011 --> 00:47:05,763
What a day!

581
00:47:08,171 --> 00:47:10,082
Is that your perfume?

582
00:47:23,531 --> 00:47:25,044
Double fault!

583
00:47:25,291 --> 00:47:27,043
I'm not blind or deaf!

584
00:47:27,371 --> 00:47:28,963
You don't have to shout!

585
00:47:29,051 --> 00:47:31,770
We're all good friends. Let's play fair.

586
00:47:32,251 --> 00:47:35,448
I always play fair, okay? Love-forty, Jane.

587
00:47:37,611 --> 00:47:40,079
- What do you mean?
- Don't let them rattle you.

588
00:47:40,171 --> 00:47:42,731
They're just trying to get you. Let's go.

589
00:47:54,411 --> 00:47:56,322
Sorry, darling. Lost my head.

590
00:47:58,411 --> 00:47:59,844
Fault.

591
00:48:28,971 --> 00:48:30,563
I've got it!

592
00:48:34,971 --> 00:48:36,484
It's not coming down.

593
00:48:52,411 --> 00:48:53,605
Come on.

594
00:48:53,891 --> 00:48:55,961
Our game. Sukie serves.

595
00:49:30,331 --> 00:49:31,446
Stop!

596
00:50:08,491 --> 00:50:10,083
Good going, Daryl.

597
00:50:50,931 --> 00:50:52,523
Maleficio!

598
00:50:55,291 --> 00:50:56,724
This drink is strong. What is it?

599
00:50:56,811 --> 00:50:58,881
Rum... vodka...

600
00:50:59,851 --> 00:51:01,443
...brandy...

601
00:51:01,611 --> 00:51:02,885
...acid.

602
00:51:03,611 --> 00:51:05,124
I'm only kidding.

603
00:51:05,451 --> 00:51:08,329
I don't mind. Drugs have no effect on me.

604
00:51:08,811 --> 00:51:10,403
Neither does alcohol.

605
00:51:10,731 --> 00:51:13,450
It's true. It's boring, but it's true.

606
00:51:18,491 --> 00:51:20,721
Are you going to seduce me, too?

607
00:51:22,411 --> 00:51:23,526
Yes.

608
00:51:25,371 --> 00:51:26,645
How?

609
00:51:29,131 --> 00:51:30,484
I don't know.

610
00:51:32,771 --> 00:51:35,160
I should warn you. I get pregnant.

611
00:51:36,491 --> 00:51:39,369
I get pregnant all the time.
At the drop of a hat.

612
00:51:39,451 --> 00:51:41,681
From borrowing your toothbrush.

613
00:51:42,571 --> 00:51:44,482
I'll keep that in mind.

614
00:51:46,691 --> 00:51:48,329
That doesn't bother you?

615
00:51:53,131 --> 00:51:55,247
You're not like other men, are you?

616
00:51:55,851 --> 00:51:56,966
I'm not.

617
00:51:57,451 --> 00:52:01,763
Most men, well, my husband,
try to keep everything under control...

618
00:52:02,051 --> 00:52:04,281
...pretend everything is normal.

619
00:52:04,491 --> 00:52:08,484
Always rational,
always an explanation for everything.

620
00:52:09,131 --> 00:52:13,283
Men need that, don't they?
To feel... everything is solid.

621
00:52:13,531 --> 00:52:16,091
And the world just isn't like that.

622
00:52:16,811 --> 00:52:19,371
Certainly not with you three around.

623
00:52:36,251 --> 00:52:39,129
We're not so different from other women.

624
00:52:39,331 --> 00:52:41,401
Women are more natural, right?

625
00:52:41,731 --> 00:52:45,087
And nature is crazy,
no matter what science says.

626
00:52:47,491 --> 00:52:49,766
- So I don't mind.
- You don't mind what?

627
00:52:51,011 --> 00:52:55,163
I don't mind when peculiar things happen.
It's natural...

628
00:52:55,491 --> 00:52:57,925
...because the world is a peculiar place.

629
00:52:58,371 --> 00:53:00,601
And you're a very peculiar person.

630
00:53:01,851 --> 00:53:02,920
Thank you.

631
00:53:05,251 --> 00:53:07,446
I would love to be a woman.

632
00:53:08,731 --> 00:53:10,005
Really? Why?

633
00:53:10,371 --> 00:53:13,727
Just look what you can do
with your bodies.

634
00:53:14,211 --> 00:53:16,281
Make babies and...

635
00:53:17,251 --> 00:53:19,811
...make milk to feed the babies.

636
00:53:22,691 --> 00:53:24,602
If I could do that...

637
00:53:26,371 --> 00:53:28,282
Who are you, really?

638
00:53:30,851 --> 00:53:33,081
Anybody you want me to be.

639
00:56:02,211 --> 00:56:04,441
Look at what they can do.

640
00:56:05,891 --> 00:56:07,802
These are human beings.

641
00:56:18,051 --> 00:56:21,566
When you're a kid
and don't understand anything...

642
00:56:21,891 --> 00:56:24,928
...you think when you grow up
it will all make sense.

643
00:56:25,251 --> 00:56:28,288
Then when you grow up,
you keep waiting for the day.

644
00:56:28,371 --> 00:56:30,123
You think it ever happens?

645
00:56:32,011 --> 00:56:34,844
It starts when you open your eyes
and realize what the future...

646
00:56:34,931 --> 00:56:36,523
...has in store for you.

647
00:56:37,571 --> 00:56:40,927
And what do you see
when you open your eyes?

648
00:56:45,611 --> 00:56:47,841
It's a short life, isn't it?

649
00:56:49,131 --> 00:56:52,282
Sometimes I look in the mirror
and I see everything...

650
00:56:52,331 --> 00:56:54,481
...disintegrating faster and faster.

651
00:56:59,691 --> 00:57:01,602
I always see snakes.

652
00:57:01,931 --> 00:57:03,842
Hundreds of them.

653
00:57:04,331 --> 00:57:06,720
They crawl all over me and I disappear.

654
00:57:07,051 --> 00:57:09,281
Then I'm just not there anymore.

655
00:57:15,531 --> 00:57:19,524
I don't mind that it's a short life
or growing old or disappearing.

656
00:57:20,171 --> 00:57:24,005
It's the pain that scares me.
I don't know why there has to be...

657
00:57:24,651 --> 00:57:26,403
...so much pain.

658
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:34,568
We don't deal the deck down here,
we just...

659
00:57:34,891 --> 00:57:36,961
...play the percentages.

660
00:58:21,771 --> 00:58:22,886
Whores.

661
00:58:28,011 --> 00:58:29,285
Whores!

662
00:58:32,011 --> 00:58:33,285
Whores!

663
00:58:39,531 --> 00:58:41,123
Look around you.

664
00:58:41,931 --> 00:58:44,650
Look around you.
Do you see what's happening?

665
00:58:45,451 --> 00:58:46,884
In our town.

666
00:58:47,211 --> 00:58:49,122
In our very homes!

667
00:58:53,131 --> 00:58:55,850
You know who I'm talking about.
You know!

668
00:58:56,491 --> 00:58:59,847
You know what's going on in that house!
There is vice!

669
00:59:00,091 --> 00:59:01,570
There's perversions!

670
00:59:01,771 --> 00:59:03,363
Shamelessness!

671
00:59:03,931 --> 00:59:05,364
Cavorting...

672
00:59:05,771 --> 00:59:07,682
...with that... devil!

673
00:59:07,811 --> 00:59:09,722
She's fine. She's sick.

674
00:59:11,451 --> 00:59:14,249
No! Drugs! Drugs are next.

675
00:59:14,731 --> 00:59:15,846
Murder!

676
00:59:16,331 --> 00:59:17,605
Rape!

677
00:59:19,051 --> 00:59:20,245
Incest!

678
00:59:20,651 --> 00:59:22,243
Spanish flies!

679
00:59:22,651 --> 00:59:24,960
Dildos! Anal intercourse!

680
00:59:28,171 --> 00:59:29,923
Listen to me!

681
00:59:31,051 --> 00:59:32,006
Sorry!

682
00:59:49,931 --> 00:59:51,842
Let's go home, Felicia.

683
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:54,241
You employ one of them, Clyde.

684
00:59:54,491 --> 00:59:56,243
That's nobody's business.

685
00:59:57,451 --> 00:59:59,840
It is everybody's business!

686
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:04,650
You know, once... there was a paradise.

687
01:00:05,691 --> 01:00:08,489
Then a serpent came into that garden.

688
01:00:08,731 --> 01:00:11,529
For Christ's sake, Felicia, would you stop?

689
01:00:16,811 --> 01:00:19,200
I have nothing against a good fuck.

690
01:00:20,811 --> 01:00:22,961
But there is danger here.

691
01:00:24,971 --> 01:00:27,849
Somebody has to do something about it.

692
01:00:56,971 --> 01:00:58,245
Okay, stop.

693
01:00:58,731 --> 01:01:00,323
Stop! Stop.

694
01:01:05,291 --> 01:01:07,043
Let's get rid of the music.

695
01:01:08,011 --> 01:01:12,482
Throw it away! Get rid of it.
Let's get rid of the music.

696
01:01:14,891 --> 01:01:17,451
I want you all to close your eyes.

697
01:01:18,931 --> 01:01:20,808
Take a deep breath.

698
01:01:22,411 --> 01:01:24,003
Let it all out.

699
01:01:26,411 --> 01:01:28,561
Now we'll pick up our instruments...

700
01:01:29,811 --> 01:01:31,881
...and when I count to four...

701
01:01:32,451 --> 01:01:34,965
...we'll play the shit out of this thing.

702
01:01:45,771 --> 01:01:47,841
That's it, just relax.

703
01:01:49,291 --> 01:01:51,361
Take it easy. Good.

704
01:01:52,651 --> 01:01:53,925
Nice!

705
01:01:54,891 --> 01:01:56,165
Smile.

706
01:01:56,491 --> 01:01:58,721
Come on, smile, Martha.

707
01:02:10,731 --> 01:02:13,768
Just let it flow over you. Good.

708
01:02:17,451 --> 01:02:19,203
Let it tickle you now.

709
01:02:23,851 --> 01:02:26,240
You've got it now. Come on!

710
01:02:26,531 --> 01:02:27,725
It's yours!

711
01:02:41,131 --> 01:02:44,328
These aren't phrases,
these are human outcries!

712
01:03:09,611 --> 01:03:12,489
Double, double chocolate.
These are fabulous.

713
01:03:46,091 --> 01:03:48,207
Are you buying the paper or not?

714
01:03:49,931 --> 01:03:51,205
Slut.

715
01:03:53,171 --> 01:03:54,524
What did you say?

716
01:03:54,731 --> 01:03:56,005
You heard her.

717
01:04:11,051 --> 01:04:13,281
She's not wearing a bra.

718
01:04:14,611 --> 01:04:16,249
How could you do this?

719
01:04:16,331 --> 01:04:18,891
We didn't use any names
except for Van Horne.

720
01:04:18,931 --> 01:04:21,001
You don't know what goes on there.

721
01:04:21,331 --> 01:04:23,720
The whole town is talking about it.

722
01:04:23,851 --> 01:04:26,570
This is so unfair. It's also untrue.

723
01:04:28,211 --> 01:04:31,567
He filled in the wetlands
and ruined it for the birds.

724
01:04:31,851 --> 01:04:34,411
He altered the landmark building...

725
01:04:35,091 --> 01:04:37,605
...and the town is suing him for $2 million.

726
01:04:37,651 --> 01:04:39,721
How can you do this to me?

727
01:04:40,011 --> 01:04:43,208
I work very hard
and you know I'm a good writer.

728
01:04:48,011 --> 01:04:50,400
I don't own the newspaper, you know.

729
01:04:54,251 --> 01:04:56,162
It's Felicia, isn't it?

730
01:04:56,691 --> 01:04:57,806
She's a...

731
01:04:58,931 --> 01:05:00,250
...very sick woman.

732
01:05:00,331 --> 01:05:04,643
She's having a very bad time.
And I don't know what to do.

733
01:05:05,611 --> 01:05:07,522
I want her to see a doctor.

734
01:05:07,851 --> 01:05:11,366
Well, not a doctor, you know,
but a... doctor.

735
01:05:22,411 --> 01:05:24,800
We went to high school together.

736
01:05:26,571 --> 01:05:28,050
She was a catch.

737
01:05:30,091 --> 01:05:34,448
Ever since the accident,
she just hasn't been the same. And now...

738
01:05:39,531 --> 01:05:41,283
I'm so sorry, Clyde.

739
01:05:50,891 --> 01:05:52,370
What am I doing?

740
01:05:52,811 --> 01:05:54,130
Firing me.

741
01:05:59,531 --> 01:06:02,091
All these terrible things she says...

742
01:06:04,171 --> 01:06:06,082
...they're not true, are they?

743
01:06:09,451 --> 01:06:11,601
We should stop seeing each other.

744
01:06:11,691 --> 01:06:13,443
Let's not overreact.

745
01:06:14,251 --> 01:06:17,163
- I think we should.
- It's a small town, Daryl.

746
01:06:17,451 --> 01:06:20,284
We haven't done anything wrong.
Why stop seeing each other?

747
01:06:20,371 --> 01:06:22,248
Clyde says that Felicia has visions.

748
01:06:22,331 --> 01:06:23,650
Why women always have visions?

749
01:06:23,731 --> 01:06:25,881
She sees the devil here in Eastwick.

750
01:06:26,091 --> 01:06:29,128
If you were the devil,
would you come to Eastwick?

751
01:06:29,451 --> 01:06:31,567
Oh, I don't know.

752
01:06:31,731 --> 01:06:32,880
Poor Felicia.

753
01:06:32,971 --> 01:06:36,486
Poor Felicia?
She talked to all of my students' mothers.

754
01:06:36,531 --> 01:06:38,328
I had 12 cancellations this week.

755
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:40,879
People tell Carol her mother is a dyke.

756
01:06:40,971 --> 01:06:42,802
You're being sued for millions.

757
01:06:42,891 --> 01:06:44,483
That is inconvenient.

758
01:06:44,691 --> 01:06:47,251
She's not kidding
with her medieval morality.

759
01:06:47,691 --> 01:06:50,569
I think Sukie is right.
Maybe we should stop.

760
01:06:51,051 --> 01:06:52,086
Maybe she should stop.

761
01:06:52,171 --> 01:06:54,446
You can't be serious. We're a family.

762
01:06:54,731 --> 01:06:57,450
Just for a while until things settle down.

763
01:07:00,011 --> 01:07:01,922
Don't let her get to you.

764
01:07:02,251 --> 01:07:03,684
Have a cherry.

765
01:07:14,091 --> 01:07:17,766
They are selling pornography
at Schyler's News Shop.

766
01:07:18,891 --> 01:07:21,280
In the open. On the shelves.

767
01:07:21,611 --> 01:07:23,841
Children are looking at this...

768
01:07:26,731 --> 01:07:28,483
It's in broad daylight.

769
01:07:29,291 --> 01:07:32,010
I can't understand one word you're saying!

770
01:07:32,211 --> 01:07:34,406
They're standing in line...

771
01:07:41,451 --> 01:07:43,362
Filth in broad daylight.

772
01:07:53,611 --> 01:07:55,442
She made a scene at Schyler's.

773
01:07:55,531 --> 01:07:58,728
Grabbing magazines from kids
and chasing them.

774
01:07:59,371 --> 01:08:02,920
She's in pain. Clyde, too.
He started drinking again.

775
01:08:03,211 --> 01:08:06,169
She's twisted.
Getting to me through my kid is sick.

776
01:08:06,251 --> 01:08:09,209
- We could help.
- By putting her out of her misery.

777
01:08:09,291 --> 01:08:11,851
Please. They're lucky to have each other.

778
01:08:11,891 --> 01:08:15,201
If they don't appreciate that,
I have no sympathy.

779
01:08:15,691 --> 01:08:18,649
Easy for you to say.
You don't have kids or a family.

780
01:08:19,251 --> 01:08:22,721
You're my family. I don't want to lose it.

781
01:08:23,851 --> 01:08:26,570
I just can't stand to see you upset.

782
01:08:27,891 --> 01:08:30,086
You don't know what it does to me.

783
01:08:31,371 --> 01:08:33,282
I wish she would just go away.

784
01:08:35,371 --> 01:08:37,123
Have another cherry.

785
01:08:55,851 --> 01:08:57,921
He's trying to get inside me.

786
01:08:59,051 --> 01:09:00,609
He's trying to use me.

787
01:09:01,931 --> 01:09:04,161
And he's using these women, too.

788
01:09:05,931 --> 01:09:08,161
He wants to take our goodness.

789
01:09:13,131 --> 01:09:15,247
He wants to get inside me.

790
01:09:17,291 --> 01:09:18,883
Just like a man.

791
01:09:19,731 --> 01:09:21,323
Tickle, diddle.

792
01:09:26,731 --> 01:09:30,724
God made us in the image of goodness.
Look what we've become.

793
01:09:34,571 --> 01:09:36,323
Animals gone mad...

794
01:09:37,011 --> 01:09:39,889
...devouring the earth and each other.

795
01:09:41,651 --> 01:09:43,881
Eat, eat, eat, eat!

796
01:09:47,531 --> 01:09:49,647
Felicia, calm down.

797
01:09:58,851 --> 01:10:00,603
I know who he is, Clyde.

798
01:10:02,051 --> 01:10:03,643
Have another cherry.

799
01:10:16,411 --> 01:10:18,527
What have you been eating?

800
01:10:19,331 --> 01:10:21,083
Those poor women.

801
01:10:21,571 --> 01:10:23,163
I have to warn them.

802
01:10:29,731 --> 01:10:31,642
He'll propagate, Clyde.

803
01:10:33,571 --> 01:10:35,641
He will increase his number.

804
01:10:38,331 --> 01:10:41,243
Those women are going to bear him sons.

805
01:10:42,531 --> 01:10:46,444
He's going to take their love
and destroy the Earth with it.

806
01:11:06,371 --> 01:11:08,123
Let's call it a day.

807
01:12:26,051 --> 01:12:27,484
I don't believe it.

808
01:12:30,371 --> 01:12:32,441
I know him. He couldn't do this.

809
01:12:33,091 --> 01:12:35,651
Alex, don't you get it? God!

810
01:12:36,971 --> 01:12:38,040
Us!

811
01:12:39,171 --> 01:12:41,082
Last night, all that talk.

812
01:12:41,331 --> 01:12:43,083
Those were just words.

813
01:12:43,331 --> 01:12:46,209
They make things happen.
We make things happen.

814
01:12:46,451 --> 01:12:48,760
- We had nothing to do with this.
- Yes, we do!

815
01:12:48,851 --> 01:12:50,364
We should talk to Daryl.

816
01:12:50,451 --> 01:12:53,170
Why? Why do we have to do
everything Daryl says?

817
01:12:53,411 --> 01:12:54,639
She's right.

818
01:12:54,691 --> 01:12:57,410
Some man comes along
and nothing else matters!

819
01:12:57,731 --> 01:12:59,483
You are so dumb, Jane.

820
01:12:59,811 --> 01:13:02,962
- This is about us, not Daryl.
- Let's call him.

821
01:13:03,091 --> 01:13:05,730
Can't you stop thinking
from between your legs?

822
01:13:05,851 --> 01:13:07,079
You bitch!

823
01:13:08,691 --> 01:13:10,044
Shut up, Sukie!

824
01:13:52,691 --> 01:13:54,363
Anybody called?

825
01:14:41,571 --> 01:14:43,163
Remember me?

826
01:14:44,371 --> 01:14:45,520
How are you?

827
01:14:47,171 --> 01:14:49,207
I'm hanging in there.

828
01:14:49,291 --> 01:14:50,644
What do you want?

829
01:14:51,171 --> 01:14:54,208
Nothing. I just called to see how you are.

830
01:14:55,971 --> 01:14:58,201
<i>See how things were going.</i>

831
01:14:59,011 --> 01:15:00,285
I'm fine.

832
01:15:04,291 --> 01:15:07,488
I wanted to... see how you were.

833
01:15:09,091 --> 01:15:11,161
Make sure you were okay.

834
01:15:11,811 --> 01:15:15,645
Make sure you didn't have
any uncontrollable desire to see me.

835
01:15:16,811 --> 01:15:21,282
<i>In case you were missing me</i>
<i>and you were too embarrassed to call...</i>

836
01:15:21,491 --> 01:15:23,004
...I called first.

837
01:15:23,051 --> 01:15:26,646
Then you could feel superior
and see me at the same time.

838
01:15:28,371 --> 01:15:29,804
<i>What do you say?</i>

839
01:15:30,771 --> 01:15:33,968
I don't feel superior. I feel terrible.

840
01:15:35,611 --> 01:15:37,522
I feel terrible, too.

841
01:15:37,851 --> 01:15:41,048
If we both feel terrible,
can't we do something about it?

842
01:15:41,171 --> 01:15:42,650
What's going on here?

843
01:15:42,731 --> 01:15:45,803
Nobody's calling me.
Nobody's coming to see me.

844
01:15:47,451 --> 01:15:49,282
We need a little time, okay?

845
01:15:49,371 --> 01:15:52,727
No, it's not okay, Alex. I don't understand.

846
01:15:53,051 --> 01:15:55,690
Somebody died, Daryl. Felicia is dead!

847
01:15:59,291 --> 01:16:02,681
People die all the time.
She was in a bad way.

848
01:16:02,811 --> 01:16:04,881
What does that have to do with us?

849
01:16:06,011 --> 01:16:09,447
I can't talk to you.
Don't call me, because l...

850
01:16:09,691 --> 01:16:10,885
<i>Don't hang up!</i>

851
01:16:11,051 --> 01:16:14,407
Alex, don't do this! This is not fair!

852
01:16:53,051 --> 01:16:55,121
Happy birthday!

853
01:16:56,491 --> 01:16:58,004
It's not my birthday.

854
01:16:58,811 --> 01:16:59,800
It isn't?

855
01:17:00,891 --> 01:17:02,085
You sure?

856
01:17:05,691 --> 01:17:07,283
Well, what the hell.

857
01:17:08,251 --> 01:17:10,162
Happy whatever day.

858
01:17:10,491 --> 01:17:12,561
These are my favorite fruits.

859
01:17:13,051 --> 01:17:15,042
I can't accept those, Daryl.

860
01:17:21,691 --> 01:17:23,921
I'm freezing my nuts off out here.

861
01:17:24,171 --> 01:17:26,639
I can't ask you in, I'm sorry.

862
01:17:28,411 --> 01:17:31,448
Not even for a little while? Just to dry off.

863
01:17:33,051 --> 01:17:35,201
Talk to the kids maybe.

864
01:17:36,091 --> 01:17:38,321
No. You have to go away.

865
01:17:38,971 --> 01:17:42,486
You have to go away now!
I can't see you or talk to you.

866
01:17:42,811 --> 01:17:45,041
I'm sorry, Daryl, but I can't!

867
01:18:22,331 --> 01:18:23,446
Jane?

868
01:19:01,811 --> 01:19:03,244
What's wrong with me?

869
01:19:03,331 --> 01:19:05,640
Nothing. You're pregnant.

870
01:19:10,291 --> 01:19:11,883
Three or four weeks.

871
01:19:14,411 --> 01:19:15,890
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

872
01:19:18,611 --> 01:19:22,286
I thought something was really wrong.
Are you sure?

873
01:19:22,611 --> 01:19:24,522
Do you need a doctor?

874
01:19:26,291 --> 01:19:27,883
Thank you so much.

875
01:19:28,851 --> 01:19:30,921
Ms. Spofford, your clothes.

876
01:19:58,611 --> 01:20:00,203
I want to surprise him.

877
01:20:12,371 --> 01:20:14,601
<i>It's a short life, isn't it?</i>

878
01:20:15,851 --> 01:20:18,604
<i>I look in the mirror and see everything...</i>

879
01:20:19,251 --> 01:20:21,640
<i>... disintegrating faster and faster.</i>

880
01:20:23,531 --> 01:20:25,965
<i>It's a short life, isn't it?</i>

881
01:20:27,051 --> 01:20:30,123
<i>I look in the mirror and see everything...</i>

882
01:20:30,411 --> 01:20:32,527
<i>... disintegrating faster and faster.</i>

883
01:21:07,571 --> 01:21:10,131
<i>They crawl all over me and I disappear.</i>

884
01:21:10,451 --> 01:21:12,442
<i>Then I'm just not there anymore.</i>

885
01:21:12,691 --> 01:21:13,806
Alex!

886
01:21:15,651 --> 01:21:17,562
<i>I always see snakes.</i>

887
01:21:18,771 --> 01:21:20,682
<i>Hundreds of them.</i>

888
01:21:21,171 --> 01:21:25,289
<i>They crawl all over me and I disappear.</i>
<i>Then I'm just not there.</i>

889
01:22:08,051 --> 01:22:09,484
Alex, it's me.

890
01:22:11,251 --> 01:22:14,926
It's me. Just let it go. Let it go!
Look at me!

891
01:22:20,171 --> 01:22:23,402
<i>Pain scares me.</i>
<i>I don't know why there has to be...</i>

892
01:22:24,531 --> 01:22:25,964
<i>... so much pain.</i>

893
01:22:37,771 --> 01:22:40,046
<i>I don't know why there has to be...</i>

894
01:22:40,491 --> 01:22:42,083
<i>... so much pain.</i>

895
01:23:50,131 --> 01:23:51,723
Can we talk?

896
01:23:54,451 --> 01:23:58,080
She's still hemorrhaging.
We slowed it down, but...

897
01:23:58,291 --> 01:23:59,440
Will she be okay?

898
01:23:59,531 --> 01:24:02,568
If we knew what was wrong,
we'd have a chance.

899
01:24:02,811 --> 01:24:04,005
Can we see her?

900
01:24:04,531 --> 01:24:07,682
She's still in a lot of pain.
I can't give her anything...

901
01:24:07,731 --> 01:24:10,120
...until we know what we're dealing with.

902
01:24:10,371 --> 01:24:12,282
Okay. Go ahead.

903
01:24:17,971 --> 01:24:20,690
Sweetheart, the doctor says you'll be fine.

904
01:24:22,291 --> 01:24:24,521
He doesn't know what's going on.

905
01:24:33,171 --> 01:24:34,729
I'm pregnant.

906
01:24:37,931 --> 01:24:39,410
So am I.

907
01:24:47,411 --> 01:24:49,322
That son of a bitch.

908
01:24:53,611 --> 01:24:56,079
Make him stop, please. Make him stop.

909
01:24:56,291 --> 01:24:57,929
I will, honey. I will.

910
01:25:13,011 --> 01:25:15,081
Back off, Fidel!

911
01:25:30,651 --> 01:25:31,879
Alex?

912
01:25:32,811 --> 01:25:35,200
- Don't "Alex" me!
- What a nice surprise.

913
01:25:35,291 --> 01:25:37,202
What the hell do you think you're doing?

914
01:25:37,291 --> 01:25:40,089
I said: "What the hell
do you think you're doing?"

915
01:25:40,171 --> 01:25:41,763
A little housework.

916
01:25:42,931 --> 01:25:46,924
I send these shirts out
and they come back in pieces.

917
01:25:47,331 --> 01:25:48,889
Small town.

918
01:25:49,491 --> 01:25:51,083
Not enough Orientals.

919
01:25:51,251 --> 01:25:54,288
Fidel's all thumbs with this kind of thing.

920
01:25:54,771 --> 01:25:56,443
That just leaves me.

921
01:25:56,531 --> 01:25:59,762
I'm not talking about your damn laundry,
I'm talking about...

922
01:25:59,851 --> 01:26:01,842
...Sukie and Jane and me.

923
01:26:03,051 --> 01:26:07,647
Golly. You girls sure are
having a hard time, aren't you?

924
01:26:09,291 --> 01:26:10,883
Sukie is very ill.

925
01:26:13,611 --> 01:26:15,522
Well, I'm sorry to hear it.

926
01:26:15,731 --> 01:26:17,449
Then do something about it!

927
01:26:17,931 --> 01:26:20,843
Me? What can I do about it?

928
01:26:21,331 --> 01:26:23,561
It has nothing to do with me anymore.

929
01:26:23,851 --> 01:26:25,762
It does, and you know it does!

930
01:26:25,931 --> 01:26:27,364
No, I don't.

931
01:26:28,491 --> 01:26:32,450
All I know is we were friends
and the next day I was shut out.

932
01:26:32,811 --> 01:26:34,244
That's all I know.

933
01:26:35,011 --> 01:26:37,525
One minute I was
the answer to your prayers.

934
01:26:37,611 --> 01:26:41,126
Five minutes later,
no one would give me the time of day.

935
01:26:41,171 --> 01:26:44,243
Sukie could die!
Don't you understand that?

936
01:26:44,691 --> 01:26:48,047
- I can't help it.
- Yes, you can. Don't lie to me.

937
01:26:49,651 --> 01:26:51,403
You deserted me.

938
01:26:52,491 --> 01:26:53,640
We had a deal.

939
01:26:54,051 --> 01:26:56,007
- That's no reason...
- Yes, it is!

940
01:26:56,371 --> 01:26:57,884
You pissed me off!

941
01:26:58,251 --> 01:27:00,082
Was I supposed to take it like a man?

942
01:27:00,171 --> 01:27:01,524
I gave you everything I got!

943
01:27:01,611 --> 01:27:04,728
I gave you more than anybody ever has,
and what do I get in exchange?

944
01:27:04,811 --> 01:27:07,166
A little thank you? A little gratitude?

945
01:27:07,251 --> 01:27:08,445
I get screwed!

946
01:27:09,451 --> 01:27:11,919
Oh, cut the crap!
What do you want from us?

947
01:27:12,531 --> 01:27:15,443
I want somebody to do these shirts!

948
01:27:16,051 --> 01:27:19,930
I want somebody to pay attention to me!
I want some respect!

949
01:27:20,171 --> 01:27:23,527
I want somebody
to take care of me for a change!

950
01:27:23,771 --> 01:27:25,090
How about that?

951
01:27:25,851 --> 01:27:28,763
What do I want? Christ!

952
01:27:29,011 --> 01:27:31,730
What does any man want?

953
01:27:32,691 --> 01:27:34,283
A little affection.

954
01:27:35,011 --> 01:27:36,888
A little trust.

955
01:27:38,451 --> 01:27:39,804
Goddamn it.

956
01:27:40,291 --> 01:27:43,283
Everything I did... I did for you.

957
01:27:48,771 --> 01:27:50,363
I was wrong.

958
01:27:50,851 --> 01:27:52,125
Go ahead.

959
01:27:52,451 --> 01:27:56,729
Go back to your miserable little life.
Fuck me if I care!

960
01:27:57,091 --> 01:28:00,367
If that's what you want...
that's what you'll get.

961
01:28:01,251 --> 01:28:03,811
You are not the only three women
in the world.

962
01:28:06,131 --> 01:28:08,042
You're hurting people, Daryl.

963
01:28:09,571 --> 01:28:11,323
What you did for us was great.

964
01:28:11,411 --> 01:28:13,879
But you can't use your power
to hurt people.

965
01:28:15,571 --> 01:28:17,289
Don't you understand that?

966
01:28:20,211 --> 01:28:23,408
I want my family back together, that's all.

967
01:28:24,571 --> 01:28:25,640
You...

968
01:28:26,051 --> 01:28:27,564
...and Sukie...

969
01:28:27,771 --> 01:28:29,329
...and Jane.

970
01:28:30,131 --> 01:28:31,883
I couldn't hurt Sukie.

971
01:28:32,051 --> 01:28:34,485
I couldn't hurt any of you. How could I?

972
01:28:35,851 --> 01:28:37,045
I love you.

973
01:28:37,171 --> 01:28:38,968
You don't know what love is.

974
01:28:39,051 --> 01:28:41,087
I can learn. You could teach me.

975
01:28:41,771 --> 01:28:43,489
How hard can it be?

976
01:28:46,371 --> 01:28:47,486
Let's not fight.

977
01:28:47,571 --> 01:28:50,768
You can't win.
There's no way you can win.

978
01:28:51,291 --> 01:28:54,328
There's nothing to go back to,
even if you could win.

979
01:28:54,371 --> 01:28:55,690
Can't we just...

980
01:28:56,371 --> 01:28:58,931
...put this behind us and be friends?

981
01:29:09,651 --> 01:29:11,004
See?

982
01:29:11,251 --> 01:29:13,003
Isn't that nice?

983
01:29:15,331 --> 01:29:16,764
Tell the truth.

984
01:29:17,651 --> 01:29:20,688
You missed me a little bit, didn't you?

985
01:29:26,851 --> 01:29:29,001
Let's kiss and make it better.

986
01:29:31,251 --> 01:29:32,764
What do you say?

987
01:29:35,251 --> 01:29:37,321
What are we going to do with you?

988
01:29:44,011 --> 01:29:45,569
It stopped.

989
01:30:40,811 --> 01:30:42,608
Darling, you look perfect.

990
01:30:56,691 --> 01:30:58,283
You look gorgeous.

991
01:30:59,651 --> 01:31:00,925
Feeling better?

992
01:31:01,011 --> 01:31:04,526
Much better.
Everything's going to be much better.

993
01:31:50,291 --> 01:31:51,963
We're going to town.

994
01:31:52,531 --> 01:31:56,683
The ladies have a craving
for bagels and ice cream.

995
01:33:16,011 --> 01:33:17,922
Three pinches.

996
01:33:25,571 --> 01:33:27,084
I'd like, uh...

997
01:33:27,331 --> 01:33:31,483
...dozen bagels, a pound of gravlax and
what kind of ice cream do you have?

998
01:33:31,731 --> 01:33:33,881
No ice cream. The freezer's broken.

999
01:33:37,771 --> 01:33:40,365
I'll take the bread and the fish.

1000
01:33:47,331 --> 01:33:48,650
It doesn't look like him.

1001
01:33:48,731 --> 01:33:51,291
It doesn't have to. We know who it is.

1002
01:33:51,371 --> 01:33:54,169
He looks funny with no hair.

1003
01:33:54,851 --> 01:33:56,125
It won't hurt him, will it?

1004
01:33:56,211 --> 01:33:58,441
No. We just want to send him away.

1005
01:34:04,051 --> 01:34:06,360
No ice cream. Imagine that.

1006
01:34:06,931 --> 01:34:10,446
I'll go see if I can't get some.
You go shopping.

1007
01:34:14,771 --> 01:34:18,605
I said, "A tall, dark prince
traveling under a curse.

1008
01:34:18,931 --> 01:34:20,523
"Somebody nice.

1009
01:34:20,851 --> 01:34:22,921
"Somebody you could talk to."

1010
01:34:28,531 --> 01:34:31,728
I'd like some pistachio. That is pistachio?

1011
01:34:37,811 --> 01:34:39,881
And chocolate chocolate chip.

1012
01:34:43,091 --> 01:34:45,207
- Are you okay?
- No, my leg!

1013
01:34:48,211 --> 01:34:49,690
What is it?

1014
01:34:53,651 --> 01:34:55,050
What's the matter?

1015
01:34:57,171 --> 01:34:59,082
Are you having a heart attack?

1016
01:35:27,731 --> 01:35:29,323
Girls!

1017
01:35:30,651 --> 01:35:32,369
What are you doing?

1018
01:35:35,091 --> 01:35:37,207
Girls! Girls! Please, don't!

1019
01:36:11,611 --> 01:36:13,841
"Elijah fled to the mount of God.

1020
01:36:14,131 --> 01:36:17,567
"The Lord passed by and a great,
strong wind rent the mountains...

1021
01:36:17,651 --> 01:36:20,723
"...and breaked in pieces
the rocks before the Lord..."

1022
01:36:49,011 --> 01:36:50,285
Sorry.

1023
01:36:51,091 --> 01:36:53,002
Just having a little trouble.

1024
01:36:55,171 --> 01:36:57,890
A little... trouble at home.

1025
01:36:57,971 --> 01:37:00,041
A little domestic problem.

1026
01:37:08,371 --> 01:37:10,601
Nothing... to be alarmed at.

1027
01:37:14,291 --> 01:37:17,010
Just a little... female problem.

1028
01:37:32,211 --> 01:37:33,963
Don't pay any attention.

1029
01:37:34,491 --> 01:37:36,402
It's a cheap trick.

1030
01:37:36,691 --> 01:37:39,888
Anybody can do it.
I taught it to them myself.

1031
01:37:40,891 --> 01:37:43,246
Ungrateful little bitches, aren't they?

1032
01:37:43,891 --> 01:37:47,088
I want to ask you something.
You all go to church.

1033
01:37:47,411 --> 01:37:52,041
Do you think God knew what He
was doing when He created woman?

1034
01:37:53,531 --> 01:37:55,920
No shit! I really want to know.

1035
01:37:56,251 --> 01:37:59,243
Or do you think it was
one of His minor mistakes?

1036
01:37:59,451 --> 01:38:02,761
Like tidal waves! Earthquakes! Floods!

1037
01:38:04,251 --> 01:38:06,481
Do you think women are like that?

1038
01:38:22,771 --> 01:38:24,170
What's the matter?

1039
01:38:27,251 --> 01:38:29,811
You don't think God makes mistakes?

1040
01:38:31,891 --> 01:38:33,643
Of course He does.

1041
01:38:34,131 --> 01:38:36,201
We all make mistakes.

1042
01:38:38,771 --> 01:38:41,808
Of course, we make mistakes,
they call it evil.

1043
01:38:42,491 --> 01:38:46,484
When God makes mistakes,
they call it... nature.

1044
01:38:49,971 --> 01:38:51,563
So what do you think?

1045
01:38:51,771 --> 01:38:53,841
Women... a mistake?

1046
01:38:55,291 --> 01:38:58,647
Or did He do it to us on purpose?

1047
01:38:59,571 --> 01:39:01,163
I really want to know!

1048
01:39:01,651 --> 01:39:05,041
If it's a mistake,
maybe we can do something about it!

1049
01:39:05,331 --> 01:39:07,083
Find a cure!

1050
01:39:08,371 --> 01:39:10,123
Invent a vaccine.

1051
01:39:13,011 --> 01:39:15,286
Build up our immune systems.

1052
01:39:19,091 --> 01:39:21,651
Get a little exercise.

1053
01:39:25,331 --> 01:39:26,923
Twenty push-ups a day...

1054
01:39:27,091 --> 01:39:31,562
...and you never have to be afflicted
with women, ever again!

1055
01:40:02,291 --> 01:40:03,724
Okay, that's it.

1056
01:40:04,851 --> 01:40:06,523
How do we know it worked?

1057
01:40:06,771 --> 01:40:09,001
I guess we just wait and see.

1058
01:40:10,451 --> 01:40:12,681
My God, look at this place.

1059
01:40:14,411 --> 01:40:16,003
Just in case.

1060
01:43:47,851 --> 01:43:49,125
The doll.

1061
01:44:17,131 --> 01:44:18,883
Jane, laugh!

1062
01:47:13,691 --> 01:47:15,124
Come here.

1063
01:47:38,451 --> 01:47:41,488
Look at Fidel. What does he have for you?

1064
01:48:01,931 --> 01:48:03,205
Janey, stop it.

1065
01:48:05,451 --> 01:48:06,645
Just stop it.

1066
01:48:07,531 --> 01:48:09,601
I can think about him if I want to.

1067
01:48:09,691 --> 01:48:11,443
Not when we're all together.

1068
01:48:11,531 --> 01:48:13,408
I can't help it. I miss him.

1069
01:48:13,611 --> 01:48:15,522
I do, and so do you. Admit it.

1070
01:48:15,611 --> 01:48:17,124
Okay, we admit it.

1071
01:48:17,371 --> 01:48:18,963
Do you want him back?

1072
01:49:11,851 --> 01:49:13,364
<i>Take it easy.</i>

1073
01:49:13,451 --> 01:49:16,807
<i>We don't want the whole household</i>
<i>in here, do we?</i>

1074
01:49:17,291 --> 01:49:19,202
<i>That's it. Good boys.</i>

1075
01:49:19,451 --> 01:49:21,681
<i>We're going to do just fine.</i>

1076
01:49:23,451 --> 01:49:26,648
<i>Come to Daddy and give me a big kiss.</i>

1077
01:49:31,051 --> 01:49:32,245
<i>Come to Daddy.</i>

1078
01:49:45,211 --> 01:49:47,361
<i>Oh, ladies, come on.</i>
