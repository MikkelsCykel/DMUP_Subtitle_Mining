00:00:53,332 --> 00:00:54,542
Come on!

2
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,776
Let's go.

3
00:01:39,476 --> 00:01:42,608
Hey, Josh!
Hey, Josh! Hey!

4
00:01:43,572 --> 00:01:45,133
Wasn't he great?

5
00:01:53,556 --> 00:01:56,403
Let's go Red Sox, let's go!

6
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:06,164
Come on.
Let's go!

7
00:02:06,228 --> 00:02:07,504
Let's go!

8
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,664
Come on, Mom,
it's almost over.

9
00:02:15,732 --> 00:02:17,390
She wants to talk to you.

10
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:20,427
Ruth, the game's just going
a little long.

11
00:02:22,964 --> 00:02:24,273
No, we're gonna...
We're gonna...

12
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,802
You look good.

13
00:02:29,813 --> 00:02:33,741
We're going to be heading
out of here as soon

14
00:02:35,316 --> 00:02:36,778
Ruth,
I'll get him home.

15
00:02:43,284 --> 00:02:47,059
Okay, a super-heroic run
and a super-heroic throw!

16
00:02:49,525 --> 00:02:52,972
Oh! Super-heroic!
Oh, yeah!

17
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,453
Go!
What are you doing!

18
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:00,683
Hey, Dad, can I
change the station?

19
00:03:06,132 --> 00:03:08,074
Man, your mom
is gonna kill me.

20
00:03:08,148 --> 00:03:11,443
Hey, Mommy! Mommy!
Look what Josh got me!

21
00:03:11,508 --> 00:03:13,296
- What is it?
- Fireflies.

22
00:03:13,364 --> 00:03:15,055
Okay, sure. It was nice
to meet you. Bye.

23
00:03:15,124 --> 00:03:16,073
Bye.

24
00:03:16,149 --> 00:03:18,188
- You were excellent!
- Thanks, Mom.

25
00:03:18,772 --> 00:03:19,918
Beautiful.

26
00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:22,729
Look, I got fireflies.

27
00:03:22,804 --> 00:03:24,048
- Did you get nervous?
- Oh, look at that.

28
00:03:24,116 --> 00:03:25,458
- A little bit.
- Did you?

29
00:03:40,628 --> 00:03:46,127
I may not have
your musical talent,

30
00:03:46,196 --> 00:03:48,051
In the shower,
I do all right,

31
00:03:48,116 --> 00:03:51,247
No. That's a very bad
mental image.

32
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,053
Can I keep them at home?

33
00:03:55,124 --> 00:03:56,236
What's that?

34
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,452
The fireflies?

35
00:03:57,524 --> 00:03:59,859
I don't think so, sweetie.
They might die.

36
00:03:59,924 --> 00:04:00,971
Will they die in the jar?

37
00:04:01,044 --> 00:04:03,313
No, sweetheart.
We just can't keep them

38
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,136
We'll let them go
when we get home,

39
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:07,059
We'll let them go.

40
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:09,900
Here.

41
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,533
- Mommy?
- Yeah?

42
00:04:19,604 --> 00:04:21,099
I need to pee.

43
00:04:21,556 --> 00:04:24,207
Emma, why didn't you go
when we stopped for pizza?

44
00:04:24,276 --> 00:04:25,291
I didn't have to go then.

45
00:04:25,364 --> 00:04:27,633
That's all right.
I got to get

46
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,488
Okay, honey,
we'll stop.

47
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,162
Quick!

48
00:04:41,236 --> 00:04:42,578
Emma, wait.

49
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,370
You sell wiper fluid?

50
00:05:00,436 --> 00:05:02,346
Yeah, check the shelf.

51
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:14,672
Shit.

52
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,169
No! No! Oh, shit!

53
00:05:26,324 --> 00:05:27,436
Josh!

54
00:05:29,812 --> 00:05:30,827
Oh, God!

55
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,242
- Hey!
- Lou!

56
00:05:33,524 --> 00:05:35,629
Josh! Josh!

57
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,944
Oh, Dad!

58
00:05:37,012 --> 00:05:38,387
Oh, God! Oh!

59
00:05:40,276 --> 00:05:41,486
Oh, baby!

60
00:05:42,772 --> 00:05:46,068
Wait! Stop! Wait! Wait!

61
00:05:47,124 --> 00:05:48,237
We're okay.
My eye!

62
00:05:48,308 --> 00:05:49,355
It's okay, baby.

63
00:05:49,428 --> 00:05:50,638
What happened?

64
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:51,821
Nothing, we hit a log.

65
00:05:52,948 --> 00:05:55,053
You're gonna be all right.
Please don't cry.

66
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,773
Come on!
Come on, baby, breathe!

67
00:05:57,844 --> 00:05:58,792
Breathe. Come on.

68
00:05:58,868 --> 00:06:00,275
Where's Josh?

69
00:06:01,044 --> 00:06:02,538
- Josh?
- Grace!

70
00:06:03,316 --> 00:06:05,934
Oh, my God!
No! No, get back!

71
00:06:06,004 --> 00:06:06,986
Get her in the car!

72
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,620
Daddy, what's wrong?

73
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:12,525
Oh, come back to me.

74
00:06:12,596 --> 00:06:13,610
Get in the car!

75
00:06:13,684 --> 00:06:16,302
Please, please, baby,
come on. Come on.

76
00:06:16,756 --> 00:06:17,704
Oh!

77
00:06:23,636 --> 00:06:25,491
Dad, my eye! My eye!
I know, I know.

78
00:06:26,612 --> 00:06:27,921
Wait here,
I'll be back.

79
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:29,646
It really hurts.

80
00:06:34,452 --> 00:06:36,078
Hi, how much for these?
$1.50.

81
00:06:36,148 --> 00:06:38,253
Here.
Put these on your eye.

82
00:06:38,324 --> 00:06:39,884
Peas! Are you serious?
Put them on your eye!

83
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,573
No, I'm not putting
cold peas on my eye!

84
00:06:42,644 --> 00:06:45,961
Put them on your eye, Lou.
Don't give me a hard time!

85
00:06:56,084 --> 00:06:59,379
Mr. Learner, our sergeant
would like a word, please.

86
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,646
Are they putting him
in the ambulance?

87
00:07:09,684 --> 00:07:11,757
Is he going to be all right?

88
00:07:13,556 --> 00:07:14,930
Momma?
Huh?

89
00:07:15,796 --> 00:07:17,684
Is he gonna be okay?

90
00:07:21,556 --> 00:07:23,411
Your daddy's with him.

91
00:07:25,876 --> 00:07:29,488
Mr. Learner? The vehicle
that struck your son

92
00:07:29,556 --> 00:07:32,785
was traveling
from that direction,

93
00:07:33,908 --> 00:07:37,039
Sir? Can you describe
the vehicle for me?

94
00:07:38,548 --> 00:07:42,988
Um... It was a truck
or an SUV.

95
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,489
Okay.

96
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:48,077
Did you happen
to recognize the make

97
00:07:48,148 --> 00:07:53,385
It was dark blue.

98
00:07:56,116 --> 00:07:59,761
What about the driver, sir?
Could you describe the driver?

99
00:07:59,828 --> 00:08:01,421
I don't know.

100
00:08:02,004 --> 00:08:06,892
He had a hat on,
or something was obscured...

101
00:08:06,964 --> 00:08:08,622
Like a ball cap?

102
00:08:10,196 --> 00:08:11,690
I don't know.

103
00:08:12,947 --> 00:08:14,573
That's all right, sir.

104
00:08:14,644 --> 00:08:16,237
Okay, Mr. Learner.

105
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,922
We can continue this
tomorrow. All right?

106
00:08:18,996 --> 00:08:20,938
I'll get one of my guys
to drive you home.

107
00:08:21,012 --> 00:08:22,987
Wait, what about my son?

108
00:08:23,859 --> 00:08:25,420
I don't want
to leave him.

109
00:08:25,492 --> 00:08:28,492
Sir, it's a crime scene,
okay? I'll...

110
00:08:29,428 --> 00:08:32,242
I'll be here on your behalf,
sir. I'll stay with your boy

111
00:08:32,308 --> 00:08:34,795
See to it that he's treated
with the utmost respect.

112
00:08:34,868 --> 00:08:37,519
You have a wife
and a little girI, sir.

113
00:08:37,588 --> 00:08:40,883
It's important
that you go home now

114
00:08:47,924 --> 00:08:49,450
Is she okay?

115
00:08:49,524 --> 00:08:51,215
Where are we going?

116
00:08:53,236 --> 00:08:55,854
We have to go home.
We're going home?

117
00:08:56,628 --> 00:08:58,635
No...
We're going home?

118
00:09:01,716 --> 00:09:03,309
Please don't cry.

119
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,162
Norris, they're here!

120
00:09:25,268 --> 00:09:26,762
Where have you been?

121
00:09:26,836 --> 00:09:28,494
Calm down, Ruth.

122
00:09:30,196 --> 00:09:32,717
Oh, my God!
Come here, sweetheart.

123
00:09:32,788 --> 00:09:35,406
What happened to you?
Oh, my God, Lucas!

124
00:09:35,476 --> 00:09:39,666
Sweetheart, let me see that.
How did you do this?

125
00:09:39,732 --> 00:09:42,634
There was a log in the road
and we came around a bend

126
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:45,839
and we hit the log
and then his head

127
00:09:45,908 --> 00:09:47,152
Why wasn't he wearing
his seatbelt?

128
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,430
- He was wearing his seatbelt.
- Sorry, Mom.

129
00:09:48,499 --> 00:09:50,190
I took it off
to change the radio station.

130
00:09:50,259 --> 00:09:52,812
I didn't know he took it off. I
would've told him to put it back on.

131
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:54,411
Oh, sweetheart, let me see.
Can you open your eye?

132
00:09:54,484 --> 00:09:55,978
- No, it hurts.
- Oh.

133
00:09:56,052 --> 00:09:57,328
Look at his eye,
Norris.

134
00:09:57,396 --> 00:09:59,184
- Let me see that.
- Look,

135
00:09:59,252 --> 00:10:01,641
Oh, my God!
What happened?

136
00:10:01,716 --> 00:10:02,829
So where were you?

137
00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:04,842
We were at a game,
the game ran late!

138
00:10:04,915 --> 00:10:07,020
You know, one month
you have him for visitation,

139
00:10:07,091 --> 00:10:10,125
just one month, and you
bring him home like this!

140
00:10:10,196 --> 00:10:12,400
Every time
I cut you some slack,

141
00:10:12,468 --> 00:10:14,672
You cut me some slack?
You're calling me

142
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,201
every time I take him
out of the house!

143
00:10:16,276 --> 00:10:17,291
All right!
Give me a goddamn break!

144
00:10:17,364 --> 00:10:19,819
You don't want anymore
bother from me? Okay!

145
00:10:20,948 --> 00:10:22,955
Everybody take a step back.

146
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,802
Christ!
You have no idea

147
00:10:27,859 --> 00:10:29,103
Let's get that
cleaned up.

148
00:10:29,171 --> 00:10:31,277
Hey, Lou, you okay?

149
00:10:31,347 --> 00:10:33,736
Yeah, Dad.
I'll see you

150
00:10:34,196 --> 00:10:35,440
Yeah.

151
00:10:42,836 --> 00:10:44,494
Can you get the door?

152
00:10:44,564 --> 00:10:46,931
It's okay, honey,
we're home now.

153
00:11:05,012 --> 00:11:06,921
WOInformation.
What state, please?

154
00:11:06,996 --> 00:11:08,752
Connecticut.
What listing?

155
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,406
A police station in
Windham Harbor, please.

156
00:11:11,476 --> 00:11:13,166
One moment, please.

157
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:38,257
I need you to be
a brave girI for me, Emma.

158
00:11:39,124 --> 00:11:41,066
Josh isn't coming home.

159
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:46,161
He's not coming home?
Never?

160
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,903
He's with the angels now.

161
00:11:52,339 --> 00:11:54,162
Where's Mommy?
No, come here.

162
00:11:54,228 --> 00:11:55,340
Mommy!

163
00:11:57,172 --> 00:12:00,718
Mommy! Where's Mommy?

164
00:12:47,284 --> 00:12:49,007
<i>It's sunny in Windham Harbor.</i>

165
00:12:49,075 --> 00:12:51,497
<i>Temperature-wise,
up to 72 degrees.</i>

166
00:12:51,572 --> 00:12:53,775
<i>Winds from the northeast
of eight miles per hour.</i>

167
00:12:53,844 --> 00:12:55,818
<i>Clear skies
for the rest of the day.</i>

168
00:12:55,892 --> 00:13:00,431
<i>Tonight, expect a low
in the mid-50's, with clear</i>

169
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:05,163
<i>It's 7.00 a.m.
Now for the local news.</i>

170
00:13:05,236 --> 00:13:08,651
<i>Connecticut state troopers
are investigating a fatal accident...</i>

171
00:13:08,724 --> 00:13:12,172
<i>on Reservation Road
outside Windham Harbor last night.</i>

172
00:13:12,244 --> 00:13:14,032
<i>The victim
was a 10-year-old boy.</i>

173
00:13:14,099 --> 00:13:18,223
<i>State Police are anxious
to talk to the driver...</i>

174
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:21,008
<i>And they appeal to anyone
who may have been...</i>

175
00:13:21,075 --> 00:13:23,858
<i>between 8.45 and 9.15 p.m.</i>

176
00:14:38,036 --> 00:14:39,279
Where are you going?

177
00:14:39,348 --> 00:14:42,282
I have to see the police
and pick up the car.

178
00:14:42,707 --> 00:14:44,714
Can't they bring it here?

179
00:14:45,235 --> 00:14:47,472
I need to talk
to them anyways.

180
00:14:49,651 --> 00:14:51,986
Your mom should be here soon.

181
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:58,988
Don't be long.

182
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,237
I won't.

183
00:15:01,203 --> 00:15:02,730
I love you.

184
00:15:12,564 --> 00:15:13,993
16, Bridge Street.

185
00:15:31,315 --> 00:15:32,264
Thank you.

186
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:34,957
All right,
get the other side. Ready?

187
00:15:39,124 --> 00:15:40,334
Did you catch him?

188
00:15:40,404 --> 00:15:42,476
No, sir,
not yet, I'm afraid.

189
00:15:42,547 --> 00:15:45,362
'Cause I saw
an SUV out there.

190
00:15:45,427 --> 00:15:46,856
There. Right, there,
up on that truck.

191
00:15:46,931 --> 00:15:49,681
Oh, no. That's been there
since Saturday.

192
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:50,762
Right here, sir.

193
00:15:50,835 --> 00:15:52,843
Right there on that
chair right there.

194
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:55,054
But is that the make, though?

195
00:15:55,508 --> 00:15:58,857
Well, yeah. I mean,
dark, same shape.

196
00:16:04,275 --> 00:16:05,802
Keep the change.

197
00:16:13,171 --> 00:16:14,316
Hey.

198
00:16:15,668 --> 00:16:17,075
Hey, Dwight.

199
00:16:20,468 --> 00:16:21,744
Dwight.

200
00:16:22,803 --> 00:16:23,981
Yeah?

201
00:16:24,052 --> 00:16:25,677
Yeah, were you in court
this morning?

202
00:16:25,747 --> 00:16:28,268
No, the transmission went
on the Explorer,

203
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,893
so I spent the morning
dealing with that.

204
00:16:30,963 --> 00:16:33,102
How'd it go this weekend?

205
00:16:33,171 --> 00:16:35,146
This weekend?
It was okay.

206
00:16:35,859 --> 00:16:37,234
- Hey, Donna.
- Hey, Dwight.

207
00:16:37,299 --> 00:16:38,247
Yeah, why?

208
00:16:38,323 --> 00:16:39,370
Ruth called.

209
00:16:40,307 --> 00:16:42,031
Said you were late,
you were belligerent,

210
00:16:42,099 --> 00:16:43,986
and that you dropped Lucas off
with a black eye.

211
00:16:44,052 --> 00:16:47,051
Did she happen to tell you
that we were at the game

212
00:16:47,123 --> 00:16:49,971
so we were rushing home
and that's when

213
00:16:50,035 --> 00:16:52,904
so poor Lucas
hit his eye

214
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:54,441
I mean... And then...
So we show up at her place,

215
00:16:54,516 --> 00:16:56,785
and she's having
some kind of a shit fit.

216
00:16:56,852 --> 00:16:59,503
Look, buddy,
you can't get into

217
00:16:59,572 --> 00:17:02,888
If she drags you in front of
a judge again, you're screwed.

218
00:17:02,964 --> 00:17:04,524
You're right.

219
00:17:05,043 --> 00:17:07,596
Nora Fannelli's
in the waiting room.

220
00:17:07,667 --> 00:17:08,779
Fuck.

221
00:17:18,899 --> 00:17:20,906
Hi, Nora, how are you?

222
00:17:20,979 --> 00:17:24,176
Bored. I have been waiting
for 40 minutes.

223
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:27,178
Yeah, sorry.
I had some trouble

224
00:17:29,619 --> 00:17:32,489
You look good.
Have you lost some weight?

225
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:42,477
Except for the color,
they're all so similar.

226
00:17:44,692 --> 00:17:46,514
It just happened so fast.

227
00:17:46,579 --> 00:17:48,968
That's okay, sir,
take your time.

228
00:17:49,683 --> 00:17:52,139
I'm sure
it will come back to you.

229
00:17:52,211 --> 00:17:55,790
We investigated the crash site
and we collected

230
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,543
Perhaps some of those
may help us.

231
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:14,313
Do you recognize
that jar, sir?

232
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:17,837
It's a peanut jar.

233
00:18:19,667 --> 00:18:22,001
Josh collected
fireflies in it.

234
00:18:23,539 --> 00:18:26,223
Do you think that's maybe
why he got out of

235
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:28,200
To collect fireflies?

236
00:18:32,563 --> 00:18:34,221
To let them go.

237
00:18:42,739 --> 00:18:46,220
DONNA ON PHONE. Dwight,
your taxi's here to take you

238
00:18:59,283 --> 00:19:01,138
I don't want to do this,
Grandma.

239
00:19:01,203 --> 00:19:03,210
Oh, come on.
Sure you do.

240
00:19:04,372 --> 00:19:06,346
Hey, Dad.
Hey, baby.

241
00:19:07,219 --> 00:19:09,194
How are you?
I'm good.

242
00:19:09,684 --> 00:19:10,731
Ethan.

243
00:19:10,803 --> 00:19:14,065
Oh, I'm so sorry.
My poor daughter.

244
00:19:15,219 --> 00:19:16,975
I'm glad you're here.

245
00:19:17,939 --> 00:19:20,525
No, no, baby.
You stay with me.

246
00:19:20,596 --> 00:19:22,767
Okay.
We'll play some more,

247
00:19:22,835 --> 00:19:24,777
All right. Okay.
Okay.

248
00:19:25,396 --> 00:19:26,857
Is it my turn?
Yeah.

249
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:30,923
Hey.

250
00:19:34,835 --> 00:19:37,007
They get anyone?

251
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:39,082
They don't have
anything yet.

252
00:19:39,155 --> 00:19:40,103
Not anything?

253
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,324
Nothing.

254
00:19:47,155 --> 00:19:49,457
Did you remember
anything else?

255
00:19:52,243 --> 00:19:53,388
No.

256
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:55,409
Perhaps...

257
00:19:56,627 --> 00:19:57,674
I didn't have...

258
00:19:57,747 --> 00:19:59,918
I looked at the makes
of some cars

259
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:03,913
and they said
they sent some stuff

260
00:20:03,987 --> 00:20:05,810
and in a few days...

261
00:20:07,571 --> 00:20:10,092
Do you know
why he got out of the car?

262
00:20:19,187 --> 00:20:20,878
Ethan?
What?

263
00:20:21,939 --> 00:20:24,273
Let's not think
about it, Grace.

264
00:20:25,619 --> 00:20:26,732
Ethan?

265
00:20:26,803 --> 00:20:28,363
What do you
want to know, Grace?

266
00:20:32,179 --> 00:20:34,765
Why'd he get out
of the car, Ethan?

267
00:20:36,595 --> 00:20:39,344
They found
the peanut jar

268
00:20:42,003 --> 00:20:44,075
Oh, Jesus.
I know.

269
00:20:44,147 --> 00:20:45,576
Oh, Jesus.

270
00:20:45,684 --> 00:20:47,822
Oh, Jesus!
Grace, come here.

271
00:20:47,891 --> 00:20:50,258
Oh, God!
Come here. Come here.

272
00:20:50,323 --> 00:20:52,331
He was letting them go?

273
00:20:52,404 --> 00:20:53,483
Yes.

274
00:20:53,555 --> 00:20:56,490
But, Ethan, I told him!
No, no, no!

275
00:20:56,563 --> 00:20:58,505
Ethan, I told him
they were gonna die!

276
00:20:58,579 --> 00:20:59,659
Gracie, it's not your fault.

277
00:20:59,732 --> 00:21:01,641
No, no, no!
What's happening?

278
00:21:01,715 --> 00:21:03,176
Take Emma.
Ethan!

279
00:21:03,251 --> 00:21:05,226
Grace.
Oh, God!

280
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:06,859
Come here, baby.

281
00:21:06,931 --> 00:21:08,011
Come on.

282
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:09,992
Momma's gonna be
all right, okay?

283
00:21:10,067 --> 00:21:12,009
Come on, baby.
Come on.

284
00:21:48,915 --> 00:21:52,144
I'll get through
tomorrow, I promise.

285
00:21:52,211 --> 00:21:54,961
I'll be beside you
every moment. Okay?

286
00:21:59,827 --> 00:22:01,136
Come here.

287
00:22:01,651 --> 00:22:04,204
We're gonna
get through this

288
00:22:08,179 --> 00:22:10,797
I keep trying
to figure out what I did

289
00:22:10,867 --> 00:22:12,013
Don't.

290
00:22:14,899 --> 00:22:16,044
I'm so sorry.

291
00:22:16,115 --> 00:22:19,214
No, Grace,
you didn't do anything.

292
00:22:20,595 --> 00:22:22,667
Come on. Come on.
Come here.

293
00:22:24,819 --> 00:22:26,095
It's okay.

294
00:22:26,483 --> 00:22:27,793
Come here.

295
00:22:32,883 --> 00:22:36,909
And the loss of Josh
has touched the hearts

296
00:22:39,411 --> 00:22:44,627
Ethan, Grace and Emma,

297
00:22:45,587 --> 00:22:48,205
your Josh is an angel now.

298
00:22:49,779 --> 00:22:54,001
And for all of us,
he will remain

299
00:22:55,475 --> 00:23:01,618
Josh was a beautiful cellist
and today, his fellow cellists

300
00:23:02,803 --> 00:23:06,829
and his music teacher,
Ruth Wheldon,

301
00:23:48,819 --> 00:23:50,542
Oh, Jesus Christ!

302
00:24:33,971 --> 00:24:37,004
So how has this affected

303
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:41,385
The cable news channels
and your politicians

304
00:24:41,459 --> 00:24:42,669
How so, Kambiz?

305
00:24:42,739 --> 00:24:46,285
Well, they make you believe
you're a warrior nation

306
00:24:46,355 --> 00:24:49,551
I mean, your machinery
is tough, but this country

307
00:24:49,619 --> 00:24:52,008
That's bullshit. I mean,
we're fighting terrorism

308
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:53,741
We've never been stronger.

309
00:24:53,811 --> 00:24:54,891
You're from Connecticut.

310
00:24:54,963 --> 00:24:58,443
One of the most affluent,
comfortable,

311
00:24:58,515 --> 00:25:00,304
My people,
like the rest of the world,

312
00:25:00,371 --> 00:25:04,113
they come from a place... They
know about pain and suffering,

313
00:25:04,178 --> 00:25:07,495
Are you saying that
Persians and Africans

314
00:25:07,571 --> 00:25:10,156
I'm saying
these people live with pain

315
00:25:10,227 --> 00:25:11,536
and death every day.
You don't.

316
00:25:11,603 --> 00:25:12,880
You have become soft.

317
00:25:12,947 --> 00:25:17,038
It's about economics.
Poor African-Americans,

318
00:25:17,107 --> 00:25:18,863
We go through the same pain.

319
00:25:18,931 --> 00:25:22,673
I agree.
But most Americans

320
00:25:33,683 --> 00:25:35,145
I'm sorry, Professor.
No disrespect.

321
00:25:35,219 --> 00:25:38,317
No. It's a perfectly
valid point.

322
00:25:39,155 --> 00:25:43,083
So you're suggesting
that the media is in collusion

323
00:26:02,611 --> 00:26:03,821
Hey, boy.

324
00:26:05,427 --> 00:26:07,466
Hi, Mr. Learner.
Your wife's getting me

325
00:26:07,538 --> 00:26:08,967
Oh, good. How are you?

326
00:26:09,043 --> 00:26:12,174
Fine.
I brought some items.

327
00:26:14,963 --> 00:26:16,589
I forgot to ask
if you wanted milk.

328
00:26:16,659 --> 00:26:17,869
No, black is fine.
Thank you.

329
00:26:17,939 --> 00:26:19,794
Thank you very much.

330
00:26:24,978 --> 00:26:27,182
Well, we've made
some progress.

331
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:31,723
We've determined
that the SUV was fitted

332
00:26:31,794 --> 00:26:33,518
How do you know that?

333
00:26:33,587 --> 00:26:36,172
The autopsy indicates
a grill guard.

334
00:26:39,826 --> 00:26:44,398
Josh suffered a severe blow
to his rib cage,

335
00:26:44,467 --> 00:26:47,762
Unfortunately, one of them
pierced his heart.

336
00:26:47,827 --> 00:26:50,445
He died instantly.
There was no pain.

337
00:26:53,107 --> 00:26:56,555
So you're looking for
a dark SUV with a grill guard.

338
00:26:56,627 --> 00:26:59,016
- Anything more?
- How do you know?

339
00:27:01,587 --> 00:27:04,205
How do you know
that there was no pain?

340
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:07,628
Medical examiner
assured me.

341
00:27:10,227 --> 00:27:14,635
So the grill guard certainly
narrows our choices down

342
00:27:14,707 --> 00:27:17,325
We've also canvassed the area
and we set up checkpoints

343
00:27:17,395 --> 00:27:18,704
But it's been a week now.

344
00:27:18,771 --> 00:27:20,145
Yeah,
that's the point exactly.

345
00:27:20,211 --> 00:27:21,737
See, people
are creatures of habit.

346
00:27:21,811 --> 00:27:25,226
And we're hoping that someone
who travels that way

347
00:27:25,298 --> 00:27:26,989
and may have
some information

348
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:30,889
But nothing yet? I mean,
he could be out of the state.

349
00:27:30,962 --> 00:27:34,443
Have you contacted
out of state authorities

350
00:27:34,515 --> 00:27:36,719
What will happen to him
if you catch him?

351
00:27:36,787 --> 00:27:39,405
Well, he'll be prosecuted
to the full extent of the law.

352
00:27:39,475 --> 00:27:41,330
Which is what?

353
00:27:41,395 --> 00:27:43,118
Well, depending on
the circumstances,

354
00:27:43,186 --> 00:27:45,641
he could get as much
as 10 years.

355
00:27:50,483 --> 00:27:51,857
Ten years...

356
00:27:57,683 --> 00:28:00,912
What does "Depending on
the circumstances" mean?

357
00:28:00,978 --> 00:28:03,946
Well, a judge will take
certain sentencing criteria

358
00:28:04,019 --> 00:28:06,986
into account before
he assesses a sentence.

359
00:28:07,059 --> 00:28:09,393
There's a variety of factors
that would come into play.

360
00:28:09,458 --> 00:28:12,775
Sergeant Burke,
how many of these killers

361
00:28:13,651 --> 00:28:16,018
I don't know
the answer to that,

362
00:28:16,082 --> 00:28:17,740
But I can find out.

363
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:00,523
She's asleep now.

364
00:29:01,683 --> 00:29:03,952
Honey, I'm looking up
state law

365
00:29:04,019 --> 00:29:05,906
and there seem to be
so many legal loopholes.

366
00:29:05,971 --> 00:29:08,720
I don't know how
one makes sense of this.

367
00:29:11,506 --> 00:29:14,157
I think we're gonna need
some help.

368
00:29:21,683 --> 00:29:24,944
Can you get some groceries
tomorrow on your way home?

369
00:29:25,523 --> 00:29:27,017
Sure.

370
00:29:28,531 --> 00:29:31,214
You have to leave the house
soon, Grace.

371
00:29:32,051 --> 00:29:33,327
I can't.

372
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,076
Not yet.

373
00:29:41,938 --> 00:29:43,018
Okay.

374
00:29:48,531 --> 00:29:50,189
Let's go to bed.

375
00:29:51,315 --> 00:29:52,362
Okay.

376
00:30:07,475 --> 00:30:08,969
Hey, Donna,
do I have any messages?

377
00:30:09,043 --> 00:30:10,603
- Dwight.
- Hey.

378
00:30:11,634 --> 00:30:12,649
Have you got a minute?

379
00:30:12,723 --> 00:30:13,803
Yeah.

380
00:30:17,971 --> 00:30:20,753
This is
Professor Ethan Learner.

381
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,186
Good afternoon. Ethan.
My associate,

382
00:30:23,251 --> 00:30:24,429
Afternoon.

383
00:30:24,499 --> 00:30:27,881
Ethan lost his son
last week in that

384
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:30,634
I'm sure you heard about it.

385
00:30:30,707 --> 00:30:33,390
Yeah, yeah, I did.
I'm sorry about that.

386
00:30:34,963 --> 00:30:36,305
Thank you.

387
00:30:36,371 --> 00:30:38,476
And he feels
he needs our help.

388
00:30:38,547 --> 00:30:39,921
Okay, sure.

389
00:30:41,042 --> 00:30:44,687
Well, it's been over a week
and the police have nothing,

390
00:30:44,755 --> 00:30:47,722
or they aren't telling us
if they have anything.

391
00:30:48,818 --> 00:30:50,793
This is an initial report.

392
00:30:55,027 --> 00:30:57,678
I want you guys
to stay on top of them.

393
00:30:58,578 --> 00:31:03,532
I want this man found
and I want him

394
00:31:08,178 --> 00:31:09,739
Did you see him?

395
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:12,239
For an instant.

396
00:31:12,307 --> 00:31:15,176
Could you give
a description of him?

397
00:31:15,379 --> 00:31:17,201
I don't know. I...

398
00:31:18,515 --> 00:31:21,679
If I saw a photo,
maybe I would... I think...

399
00:31:22,738 --> 00:31:28,106
Okay. Look, right now our job
is to stay on top of

400
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:29,640
Light a fire
under their ass.

401
00:31:29,714 --> 00:31:32,943
Make sure they
prosecute the case properly

402
00:31:33,011 --> 00:31:35,498
You might also
want to think about

403
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:37,839
Which would entail what?

404
00:31:40,083 --> 00:31:44,938
A civil suit would be a suit
that you would take out

405
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:49,200
against the person
who... Who...

406
00:31:49,266 --> 00:31:50,695
The perpetrator.

407
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:52,079
Perpetrator.

408
00:31:52,146 --> 00:31:56,685
You'd file a civil suit
against the perpetrator for

409
00:31:58,579 --> 00:32:03,696
Also, you mentioned that
your son was struck by the

410
00:32:04,403 --> 00:32:07,436
I'm sorry to bring it up, but
a suit should be brought up

411
00:32:07,506 --> 00:32:11,696
Those things are dangerous.
They're for cattle ranches,

412
00:32:13,683 --> 00:32:16,017
So we'll get
all the relevant details

413
00:32:16,082 --> 00:32:17,904
from the coroner's office,

414
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:21,996
and I think Donna has
all your contact information,

415
00:32:22,739 --> 00:32:23,753
Yes.

416
00:32:23,826 --> 00:32:25,321
Okay.
Here are our cards.

417
00:32:25,394 --> 00:32:28,460
When we get
all the information,

418
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:31,564
Dwight here will be handling
all the day-to-day details

419
00:32:31,635 --> 00:32:34,537
So if you need to talk
to anybody, anytime,

420
00:32:34,611 --> 00:32:37,426
call Dwight.
I will. Thank you.

421
00:32:37,491 --> 00:32:38,985
Sure.

422
00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:41,710
Thanks for taking the time.
Absolutely.

423
00:32:42,258 --> 00:32:44,909
Listen, I just really
want to express how sorry

424
00:32:44,978 --> 00:32:48,294
Thanks, thanks.
... and we'll take care

425
00:32:49,619 --> 00:32:51,888
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

426
00:33:11,858 --> 00:33:13,549
Oh, hey,
there's your mom.

427
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:15,691
Oh, hey.
Sorry, I'm late.

428
00:33:15,762 --> 00:33:17,551
No problem.

429
00:33:17,618 --> 00:33:19,341
Sorry, sweetheart.

430
00:33:21,043 --> 00:33:23,563
Emma did such a great job
today. I wish you

431
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:24,943
Oh, me too.

432
00:33:25,522 --> 00:33:26,951
- I'll be right back.
- Where are you going?

433
00:33:27,026 --> 00:33:29,165
I have to give a book back.
Okay.

434
00:33:29,235 --> 00:33:31,853
Emma shows so much promise
on the piano.

435
00:33:32,498 --> 00:33:35,149
I would love to put her
in the school concert

436
00:33:35,218 --> 00:33:38,731
And I'd be willing to
offer her some free

437
00:33:38,802 --> 00:33:40,526
Oh, right, you don't
have to do that.

438
00:33:40,595 --> 00:33:42,220
Oh, I'd love to.

439
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:47,047
You know, maybe it will take
her mind off things.

440
00:33:47,123 --> 00:33:48,716
Well, why don't I ask her?

441
00:33:48,787 --> 00:33:49,834
Of course.

442
00:33:49,906 --> 00:33:52,361
And we'll talk about it.
Thanks, it's very generous

443
00:33:52,434 --> 00:33:54,573
Sure. See you. Bye.
Thanks for sitting with her.

444
00:33:54,643 --> 00:33:55,919
Play that piece for your mom.

445
00:33:55,986 --> 00:33:57,579
Okay, I will.

446
00:33:59,122 --> 00:34:01,162
You were late.
Sorry.

447
00:34:02,162 --> 00:34:05,872
Listen, um,
Mrs. Wheldon was wondering

448
00:34:05,938 --> 00:34:08,272
if you'd like to play
in the school concert.

449
00:34:09,234 --> 00:34:12,104
Maybe practice with her
after school.

450
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:14,961
You don't have to do anything
you don't want to do.

451
00:34:15,026 --> 00:34:17,644
Can you hear music
if you're in heaven?

452
00:34:20,115 --> 00:34:21,195
Yes.

453
00:34:22,258 --> 00:34:24,168
Okay, then. I'll do it.

454
00:34:37,266 --> 00:34:39,568
<i>This is the Red Sox year!</i>

455
00:34:39,634 --> 00:34:42,929
<i>We are going to see
the end of the curse...</i>

456
00:34:42,995 --> 00:34:43,943
What did I tell you?

457
00:34:52,306 --> 00:34:53,735
How you doing?
Mr. Arno?

458
00:34:53,811 --> 00:34:57,106
That's right.
Do you own

459
00:34:57,170 --> 00:35:00,137
No, I, uh...
What's this about?

460
00:35:01,426 --> 00:35:02,670
Routine investigation.

461
00:35:02,738 --> 00:35:04,265
We're checking on
those types of vehicles.

462
00:35:04,338 --> 00:35:07,721
Well, I had that car and then
the transmission went.

463
00:35:07,794 --> 00:35:10,183
So I gave it to
one of those charities.

464
00:35:10,258 --> 00:35:13,641
But I haven't gotten
a receipt from those guys yet.

465
00:35:13,715 --> 00:35:15,405
- Dad?
- Yeah?

466
00:35:15,474 --> 00:35:16,587
Is everything all right?

467
00:35:16,658 --> 00:35:19,887
Yeah, yeah, it's fine.
Go on, I'll be in in a minute.

468
00:35:21,426 --> 00:35:24,426
You turn
the plates in yet?

469
00:35:24,498 --> 00:35:27,564
Oh, God, I took them to work
and I just haven't had

470
00:35:27,634 --> 00:35:29,325
to get them out
to you guys.

471
00:35:29,394 --> 00:35:30,506
You better mail them in.

472
00:35:30,578 --> 00:35:31,756
All right.
I need to account for it.

473
00:35:31,826 --> 00:35:33,102
All right. Thank you,
Officer Murphy.

474
00:35:33,171 --> 00:35:34,731
Thank you.
Sure.

475
00:35:35,955 --> 00:35:37,842
This your new car?

476
00:35:37,906 --> 00:35:41,965
Oh, no, it's a rental.
I'm just using it until I

477
00:35:42,034 --> 00:35:43,790
Better move it
in the garage.

478
00:35:43,858 --> 00:35:46,673
That bird shit
will corrode the finish.

479
00:35:46,738 --> 00:35:48,975
Yeah, you're right.
Thank you.

480
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:57,130
Are you in trouble?

481
00:35:57,202 --> 00:35:59,439
Huh? No.
I just forgot

482
00:36:02,131 --> 00:36:03,821
What's he saying?

483
00:36:03,891 --> 00:36:06,607
He's talking about the series
and some highlights.

484
00:36:06,675 --> 00:36:08,878
Who does he say
is gonna win?

485
00:36:08,947 --> 00:36:12,296
You kidding me? The Red Sox,
what else would they say?

486
00:36:18,803 --> 00:36:21,388
<i>People keep saying you need to
find closure.</i>

487
00:36:21,458 --> 00:36:23,433
<i>There is no closure.</i>

488
00:36:23,506 --> 00:36:28,110
<i>There's only acceptance
and resignation.</i>

489
00:36:31,058 --> 00:36:32,619
<i>She was going to be
a pediatric searching.</i>

490
00:36:34,578 --> 00:36:36,782
<i>The judge kept
postponing the case</i>

491
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:40,527
<i>and meanwhile, this animal
was out on $5000 bail.</i>

492
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:46,348
<i>Well, the cop who led
the investigation knew.</i>

493
00:36:46,418 --> 00:36:50,444
<i>He told me, "You'll get
no justice in the courts.</i>

494
00:36:50,514 --> 00:36:54,092
<i>I'll never forget those words.
There's no justice</i>

495
00:36:54,162 --> 00:36:55,918
<i>There's only the law.</i>

496
00:36:56,786 --> 00:36:58,379
Get the light.

497
00:36:58,450 --> 00:36:59,825
Come on.

498
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:00,970
Game's on soon.

499
00:37:01,043 --> 00:37:04,556
Grab some of those
paper plates

500
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:10,574
Are you having fries?

501
00:37:12,786 --> 00:37:13,866
Dad?

502
00:37:14,514 --> 00:37:15,594
Yeah?

503
00:37:17,011 --> 00:37:19,858
I got suspended from school
for three days.

504
00:37:22,386 --> 00:37:23,728
Why?

505
00:37:23,794 --> 00:37:27,820
I got into a fight
with Paulie Ferrari

506
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:29,900
Stitches? How many?

507
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:31,083
Six, I think.

508
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:33,544
God damn it, Lou!
What the hell's

509
00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:34,829
Are you an idiot?

510
00:37:34,898 --> 00:37:37,353
What do you mean
you gave him stitches? Huh?

511
00:37:37,426 --> 00:37:39,946
What is wrong with you?
Stop yelling!

512
00:37:43,826 --> 00:37:45,233
All right.

513
00:37:46,098 --> 00:37:48,880
All right, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

514
00:37:49,362 --> 00:37:51,631
Sit down,
tell me what happened.

515
00:37:52,658 --> 00:37:54,797
The three of us
were in the hallway

516
00:37:54,866 --> 00:37:58,128
and Paulie had a water balloon
in his hand

517
00:37:58,194 --> 00:38:02,798
and he threw it at Benny,
but it hit Ms. Swanson,

518
00:38:02,866 --> 00:38:06,183
And she wanted to know
who threw it, but Paulie

519
00:38:06,258 --> 00:38:07,403
Okay.

520
00:38:08,146 --> 00:38:11,080
So we all had to have
after-school detention.

521
00:38:12,338 --> 00:38:14,793
All right, so how did
you get into a fight?

522
00:38:14,866 --> 00:38:16,622
I was calling him
a no-good coward.

523
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:18,762
We started fighting.

524
00:38:18,834 --> 00:38:20,111
Then he hit his head
on the ground.

525
00:38:20,178 --> 00:38:22,382
I don't want you
fighting, Lou.

526
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:23,857
You and Mom
fight all the time.

527
00:38:23,922 --> 00:38:26,639
I don't care, Luke.
Don't talk back to me.

528
00:38:26,706 --> 00:38:28,778
I don't want you fighting.
Look where it got us.

529
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:32,079
But... But he was
a no-good coward, Dad.

530
00:38:32,146 --> 00:38:33,575
Wasn't he?

531
00:38:35,602 --> 00:38:38,188
I don't care.
I don't care, Lou, okay?

532
00:38:38,258 --> 00:38:41,105
Paulie Ferrari
doesn't need you

533
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:44,399
for him to know that
he did something wrong,

534
00:38:44,466 --> 00:38:46,354
What'd your mother say?

535
00:38:47,858 --> 00:38:49,865
I can't watch the game.

536
00:38:49,938 --> 00:38:51,596
All right, go to your room.

537
00:38:51,666 --> 00:38:54,186
Can you just tell me
the scores every

538
00:38:54,258 --> 00:38:56,331
Get in your room.

539
00:38:56,402 --> 00:38:57,831
It's not fair.

540
00:39:02,482 --> 00:39:04,554
<i>Come on, Josh, let's go!</i>

541
00:39:04,626 --> 00:39:05,837
<i>I love you, Josh.</i>

542
00:39:05,906 --> 00:39:09,255
<i>- I love you too, Dad. Bye!
- Call me when you're done.</i>

543
00:40:12,786 --> 00:40:14,794
What's the score?

544
00:40:14,866 --> 00:40:17,768
Well, you never told me
I couldn't listen.

545
00:40:18,386 --> 00:40:20,753
Six to six.
Bottom of the eighth.

546
00:40:23,026 --> 00:40:24,881
Listen, I want to talk to you
about what you said to me

547
00:40:24,946 --> 00:40:27,182
about me
and your mom fighting.

548
00:40:29,266 --> 00:40:30,826
When I was a little kid,
I thought

549
00:40:30,898 --> 00:40:32,872
that's how men and women
behaved toward each other.

550
00:40:32,946 --> 00:40:36,623
Your grandpa had
a pretty bad temper

551
00:40:37,618 --> 00:40:40,138
and he would fly
off the handle at

552
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:42,315
Like if his soup was cold,
he'd hit the roof.

553
00:40:42,386 --> 00:40:45,452
And I was like you
where I wanted to...

554
00:40:48,242 --> 00:40:50,576
I wanted to step
in between them.

555
00:40:55,506 --> 00:41:00,492
But I knew if I did
that he would...

556
00:41:05,074 --> 00:41:08,784
And I... I hated him.

557
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:13,486
And I hated my mom
for crying all the time.

558
00:41:15,058 --> 00:41:19,815
And I blamed him
for a lot of my problems

559
00:41:25,138 --> 00:41:30,026
And I just don't want
you to feel that way

560
00:41:31,634 --> 00:41:33,576
Never, Dad. Never.

561
00:41:37,522 --> 00:41:40,719
Well, I don't know, Luke.
Sometimes things happen

562
00:41:40,786 --> 00:41:44,779
That are just
out of your control

563
00:41:45,554 --> 00:41:49,329
and you really want
to look around for

564
00:41:49,394 --> 00:41:53,835
and those are the times when
you just really got to

565
00:41:57,682 --> 00:41:59,243
Understand?

566
00:42:06,162 --> 00:42:08,813
You wanna go see
who's up to bat?

567
00:42:08,882 --> 00:42:10,311
Yeah. Thanks, Dad.

568
00:42:10,386 --> 00:42:13,004
Hey, hey.
That's all I get

569
00:42:13,074 --> 00:42:14,732
You're the best.

570
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:50,348
Sir, raise your hands
and step out of the vehicle!

571
00:43:57,074 --> 00:43:58,481
I got this.

572
00:43:59,282 --> 00:44:01,289
I'm being arrested
for taking a picture?

573
00:44:01,362 --> 00:44:03,664
Yes. You took photos
of a diplomat's home.

574
00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:05,770
Come here.
Thank you, guys.

575
00:44:07,282 --> 00:44:09,453
Listen, you can't be
doing this.

576
00:44:09,522 --> 00:44:11,888
Conducting
your own investigation.

577
00:44:11,954 --> 00:44:13,361
No one else is.

578
00:44:13,426 --> 00:44:15,498
That's not true.
Have a seat.

579
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:17,610
Right here.
Have a seat.

580
00:44:22,674 --> 00:44:24,496
We're canvassing
the area.

581
00:44:24,562 --> 00:44:26,188
We've gone to repair shops
and junkyards.

582
00:44:26,258 --> 00:44:28,298
We're doing everything
we possibly can.

583
00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:32,144
You have to understand,
Mr. Learner,

584
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:33,835
You didn't need much time
to arrest me.

585
00:44:33,906 --> 00:44:38,161
You practically had
a SWAT team surround me

586
00:44:38,226 --> 00:44:40,909
but nobody can seem to
find my son's killer!

587
00:44:40,978 --> 00:44:44,873
My son's innocent life
was snuffed out,

588
00:44:45,778 --> 00:44:50,285
and no one seems to notice
or to give a fuck!

589
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:52,077
That's not true, sir.

590
00:44:52,146 --> 00:44:53,869
We investigated
this vehicle.

591
00:44:53,938 --> 00:44:57,069
It was involved
in a fender bender

592
00:44:57,138 --> 00:44:58,447
Diplomatic plates!

593
00:44:58,514 --> 00:45:00,936
These guys can get away
with whatever they want,

594
00:45:01,009 --> 00:45:03,977
Sir, you know, I think
you need to calm down.

595
00:45:04,722 --> 00:45:06,544
We've been in touch
with your lawyers,

596
00:45:06,609 --> 00:45:10,919
and you have to believe me
that I want this guy

597
00:45:10,994 --> 00:45:12,685
Then get him.

598
00:45:14,801 --> 00:45:18,282
It was an accident,
but what I did

599
00:45:20,145 --> 00:45:23,560
I left that night
because I was afraid

600
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:28,367
And that's no excuse.

601
00:45:30,834 --> 00:45:33,103
I'm gonna go to prison.

602
00:45:35,282 --> 00:45:37,551
And I deserve to go to prison.

603
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:04,589
People are gonna talk
behind your back.

604
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:09,228
They're gonna say
hurtful things,

605
00:46:11,666 --> 00:46:16,041
but I just wanna urge you to
remember these days

606
00:46:16,114 --> 00:46:20,140
I feel like for the first time
I've been able

607
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:21,770
that you deserve,

608
00:46:29,202 --> 00:46:32,747
and they've really been
the most beautiful days

609
00:46:36,049 --> 00:46:38,602
And I just wanna say
I'm sorry, honey.

610
00:46:39,698 --> 00:46:42,153
I'm sorry
and I love you so much.

611
00:46:42,738 --> 00:46:44,745
And I hope that one day
when this is all over that

612
00:46:44,818 --> 00:46:47,982
we'll be able to get back
to where we are today.

613
00:46:50,962 --> 00:46:52,456
I love you.

614
00:47:07,569 --> 00:47:09,293
What are you doing?

615
00:47:09,874 --> 00:47:10,986
Hi.

616
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:16,300
I was just looking at
some of this stuff.

617
00:47:16,913 --> 00:47:19,433
I've been trying
to show you this.

618
00:47:22,546 --> 00:47:25,545
That's a chat room of people
who help to

619
00:47:25,617 --> 00:47:29,262
drunk drivers,
lenient judges.

620
00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:31,719
Here, let me show you this.

621
00:47:31,794 --> 00:47:35,241
I've been looking into
some other possibilities.

622
00:47:36,465 --> 00:47:38,604
What sort of possibilities?

623
00:47:39,282 --> 00:47:41,005
Of how to find this guy.

624
00:47:41,073 --> 00:47:43,594
I thought that was why
we got lawyers.

625
00:47:48,241 --> 00:47:50,575
Why are you doing this?

626
00:47:50,642 --> 00:47:54,504
Because it's been over a month
and no one else

627
00:47:55,410 --> 00:47:57,996
Please don't tell me
I have to defend myself

628
00:47:58,066 --> 00:48:00,237
As well as who?
Everybody.

629
00:48:00,306 --> 00:48:04,648
Everybody I talk to says,
"Move on, put it behind you,

630
00:48:04,721 --> 00:48:06,729
Why?
Why do they say that?

631
00:48:06,801 --> 00:48:08,590
People don't know
what to say.

632
00:48:08,657 --> 00:48:10,991
No. They've given up
on finding this guy

633
00:48:11,058 --> 00:48:12,967
and they want me to
resign myself to the fact

634
00:48:13,042 --> 00:48:15,431
that he's never
gonna be caught.

635
00:48:15,506 --> 00:48:16,815
Why should he
get away with it?

636
00:48:16,882 --> 00:48:19,184
He shouldn't
get away with it.

637
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:21,933
You think I want him
to get away with it?

638
00:48:24,113 --> 00:48:26,796
You've always been there
for us, Ethan.

639
00:48:28,177 --> 00:48:29,901
Don't abandon us now.

640
00:48:31,666 --> 00:48:35,277
That's what you think?
That I've abandoned you?

641
00:48:40,689 --> 00:48:42,696
Dinner's almost ready.

642
00:48:50,066 --> 00:48:51,243
Yes, sir?

643
00:48:51,313 --> 00:48:54,281
I'm here for
the Josh Learner case.

644
00:48:54,354 --> 00:48:56,841
The boy that was killed
on Reservation Road.

645
00:48:57,969 --> 00:48:59,246
Can I have your name, sir?

646
00:48:59,314 --> 00:49:00,623
It's Dwight Arno.

647
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:03,690
I have some important
information concerning...

648
00:49:03,762 --> 00:49:05,616
Hey, Jackie,
where's Emelda?

649
00:49:05,682 --> 00:49:07,340
I need a hand out here!
I'm dying!

650
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:08,839
She's on her break.
She'll be back in five.

651
00:49:08,914 --> 00:49:11,085
I'll get the case officer
for you, sir.

652
00:49:20,977 --> 00:49:22,384
Mr. Arno.

653
00:49:23,666 --> 00:49:25,902
What took you so long?
Come on.

654
00:49:26,769 --> 00:49:29,584
Steve called a while ago
and said you'd be

655
00:49:29,649 --> 00:49:31,307
We're just making sure
that your client doesn't have

656
00:49:31,377 --> 00:49:33,133
a reoccurrence of
the last incident.

657
00:49:33,201 --> 00:49:34,183
Hey, Sarge,
take a look at this.

658
00:49:34,257 --> 00:49:35,566
Last incident?

659
00:49:35,633 --> 00:49:38,895
Yeah, he's going around
photographing damaged SUVs.

660
00:49:38,961 --> 00:49:40,969
He scared the daylights
out of a Saudi diplomat.

661
00:49:41,042 --> 00:49:42,765
Lucky he didn't
get himself shot.

662
00:49:42,833 --> 00:49:46,379
Now he's got it in his head
somehow that the diplomat's

663
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:49,199
and there's a big cover-up.
It's a total mess.

664
00:49:49,265 --> 00:49:50,989
Sarge, I need you
to sign this report.

665
00:49:51,058 --> 00:49:53,032
Yeah, give me a minute.

666
00:49:53,105 --> 00:49:55,472
All right, here's
the reality of the case.

667
00:49:55,537 --> 00:49:58,254
We're three weeks into it
and we really don't have

668
00:49:58,321 --> 00:50:00,842
I got a dark-colored SUV
with a grill guard.

669
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:03,019
It's like finding
a needle in a haystack.

670
00:50:03,090 --> 00:50:05,032
To be frank with you,
if the guy doesn't walk

671
00:50:05,106 --> 00:50:08,815
and give himself up,
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to

672
00:50:08,881 --> 00:50:11,598
I'm hoping you can talk
to your client

673
00:50:11,666 --> 00:50:14,535
Yeah, listen, Sarge,
there's something else

674
00:50:14,610 --> 00:50:16,999
Hey, Joe.
Can you tell Sergeant Burke

675
00:50:17,074 --> 00:50:20,554
I'm so jammed up.
Listen, this is the file.

676
00:50:20,625 --> 00:50:22,119
The autopsy report
and everything.

677
00:50:22,193 --> 00:50:23,786
I'm gonna have
one of my guys

678
00:50:23,857 --> 00:50:27,272
and hand it off to you, okay?
I gotta run.

679
00:50:27,345 --> 00:50:29,963
Hey, Callaghan.
Can you copy this for Mr. Arno

680
00:50:30,033 --> 00:50:31,015
Yeah, sure thing, Sarge.

681
00:50:31,089 --> 00:50:33,325
Hey, Joe,
what was that number?

682
00:50:50,322 --> 00:50:52,558
<i>You have one</i>

683
00:50:53,297 --> 00:50:55,120
<i>First voice message.</i>

684
00:50:55,185 --> 00:50:59,658
<i>Mr. Arno,
it's Ethan again. I've</i>

685
00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:00,744
<i>Please call me back
when you can.</i>

686
00:51:00,817 --> 00:51:03,239
<i>Did you get my question
about diplomatic immunity?</i>

687
00:51:18,257 --> 00:51:19,534
Don't...

688
00:51:23,377 --> 00:51:24,904
Yes, uh...

689
00:51:26,545 --> 00:51:27,822
You okay?

690
00:51:27,889 --> 00:51:30,540
Yeah. I just had a dream.

691
00:52:14,481 --> 00:52:17,830
Wait. Just hold on.
Just give me a second.

692
00:52:22,130 --> 00:52:23,275
Shit.

693
00:52:23,921 --> 00:52:25,448
Wanna stop?

694
00:52:29,137 --> 00:52:30,544
It's okay.

695
00:52:34,033 --> 00:52:35,440
Look at me.

696
00:52:37,042 --> 00:52:38,667
- Honey?
- What?

697
00:52:40,721 --> 00:52:42,031
Is it me?

698
00:52:42,097 --> 00:52:43,341
What are you talking about?

699
00:52:46,386 --> 00:52:47,498
Do you blame me?

700
00:52:47,569 --> 00:52:49,456
Oh, Grace,
don't be ridiculous.

701
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:51,848
What are you
talking about?

702
00:52:51,921 --> 00:52:53,131
You won't even
look at me.

703
00:52:53,201 --> 00:52:55,722
What do you mean
I don't look at you?

704
00:53:00,049 --> 00:53:01,423
Why can't we
just talk about it?

705
00:53:01,489 --> 00:53:04,239
Oh, come on,
this isn't about you!

706
00:53:08,689 --> 00:53:10,478
It's the killer's fault!

707
00:53:10,545 --> 00:53:13,414
It's the son of a bitch
that stole our son away!

708
00:53:13,489 --> 00:53:15,398
That's who's to blame!

709
00:54:59,025 --> 00:55:00,967
Mommy. Mommy.

710
00:55:01,745 --> 00:55:03,469
What time is it?

711
00:55:04,401 --> 00:55:06,474
Dad's asleep downstairs.

712
00:55:07,857 --> 00:55:11,305
I'm going to be late
and there's nothing

713
00:55:12,913 --> 00:55:15,783
Well, that doesn't sound
very good, does it?

714
00:55:17,265 --> 00:55:18,606
Come here.

715
00:55:25,233 --> 00:55:27,622
Why don't we go down
together and see

716
00:55:27,697 --> 00:55:28,777
Okay.

717
00:55:30,193 --> 00:55:31,786
- Yeah?
- It's in my backpack.

718
00:55:31,857 --> 00:55:32,806
Okay.

719
00:55:32,881 --> 00:55:35,783
I'm gonna have piano lessons
this afternoon.

720
00:56:07,985 --> 00:56:09,960
Jake, high five.

721
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:12,204
Look at that,
he won't do it for me.

722
00:56:12,273 --> 00:56:13,866
High five.

723
00:56:13,937 --> 00:56:17,254
It's amazing.
You know the only one

724
00:56:24,977 --> 00:56:27,530
Hey, Dad! Dad!

725
00:56:27,601 --> 00:56:28,648
Yeah?

726
00:56:29,457 --> 00:56:31,312
Where are you going?

727
00:56:36,369 --> 00:56:37,416
Hey.

728
00:56:37,489 --> 00:56:38,951
You forgot where I live?

729
00:56:39,025 --> 00:56:42,538
Huh? No, I left my wallet
at the bank, so I was

730
00:56:42,609 --> 00:56:44,681
Got your books?

731
00:56:44,753 --> 00:56:45,833
- Yeah, I'll go get them.
- Hey, Ethan.

732
00:56:45,905 --> 00:56:47,247
Mr. Arno?

733
00:56:49,329 --> 00:56:50,703
What brings you here?

734
00:56:50,769 --> 00:56:53,136
Oh, my daughter
takes piano lessons

735
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:54,576
Oh, yeah, yeah.
She's good at that.

736
00:56:54,641 --> 00:56:55,917
That's your boy?

737
00:56:55,985 --> 00:56:57,741
Yeah, Ruth's...
Ruth's my ex-wife.

738
00:56:57,809 --> 00:56:58,857
Oh.

739
00:56:58,929 --> 00:57:01,198
Listen, I've left you
a number of messages.

740
00:57:01,265 --> 00:57:04,877
I'm sorry, you know,
I've been out of the office

741
00:57:04,945 --> 00:57:06,603
Well, when would be
a good time to get together

742
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:09,226
'cause there's some things
I'd like to talk about.

743
00:57:09,297 --> 00:57:13,094
Okay, well, let me talk
to Shelly and we'll try

744
00:57:13,169 --> 00:57:16,169
I'll be around this weekend
as well, so give me a call.

745
00:57:16,241 --> 00:57:19,918
Oh, I got my kid this weekend.
I don't get much time

746
00:57:19,985 --> 00:57:21,262
- Bye, Mr. Learner.
- Bye-bye.

747
00:57:21,329 --> 00:57:22,605
- Hey, Dad!
- Okay, well,

748
00:57:22,673 --> 00:57:23,850
- Have fun.
- Hey, baby.

749
00:57:23,921 --> 00:57:25,383
Bye, Mom.
See you, Emma.

750
00:57:25,457 --> 00:57:26,439
Bye, Lucas.

751
00:57:26,513 --> 00:57:28,814
Really good.
Keep practicing.

752
00:57:30,961 --> 00:57:32,521
I didn't know
you knew Dwight.

753
00:57:32,593 --> 00:57:34,349
Yeah, he's helping me
with some legal stuff.

754
00:57:34,417 --> 00:57:36,392
Good luck with that.

755
00:57:36,464 --> 00:57:37,926
All right, you take care.
Bye.

756
00:57:38,001 --> 00:57:39,692
See you.
Bye, Luke.

757
00:57:39,761 --> 00:57:42,411
Come on, honey,
we got to get your mom.

758
00:57:44,177 --> 00:57:47,472
So, your mom's teaching
music lessons again?

759
00:57:47,537 --> 00:57:50,853
Just that girI.
Her brother Josh

760
00:57:50,929 --> 00:57:53,067
In that car crash
the day we went to Fenway.

761
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:57,577
No, I don't think
it was the same day, man.

762
00:58:02,449 --> 00:58:04,237
Did you know that kid?

763
00:58:05,329 --> 00:58:09,038
I saw him around.
He was a bit of a dweeb,

764
00:58:10,064 --> 00:58:11,275
You know his dad?

765
00:58:11,345 --> 00:58:13,963
Huh? Yeah. I'm doing
some legal work for him.

766
00:58:16,497 --> 00:58:18,352
Did he say
anything about that?

767
00:58:18,417 --> 00:58:19,431
Like what, Dad?

768
00:58:19,505 --> 00:58:20,650
I don't know.

769
00:58:24,529 --> 00:58:28,457
So I was thinking,
I don't know, we get

770
00:58:28,529 --> 00:58:30,122
and some snacks.
What do you think?

771
00:58:30,193 --> 00:58:32,844
Sounds good.
But do you have money?

772
00:58:32,913 --> 00:58:35,662
Why? Did your mom tell you
I don't have any money again?

773
00:58:35,729 --> 00:58:38,511
No, you told me
you left your wallet

774
00:58:38,577 --> 00:58:41,195
Oh. No, no, no,
I got some extra cash.

775
00:58:43,312 --> 00:58:45,068
Let's go Red Sox.

776
00:58:47,633 --> 00:58:49,226
Okay, sit down.

777
00:58:54,321 --> 00:58:58,096
Do you think mom
would let me live with you

778
00:58:59,889 --> 00:59:02,888
I think that's a talk
for another day, buddy.

779
00:59:03,921 --> 00:59:06,409
All right,
we're missing the game.

780
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,619
Come on, guys.

781
00:59:26,609 --> 00:59:28,781
What is this? Wait.
What are you doing?

782
00:59:28,849 --> 00:59:30,158
Who said you could take this?

783
00:59:30,225 --> 00:59:33,225
Hey, hold on a minute.
Who said you could do this?

784
00:59:33,297 --> 00:59:34,507
Grace!

785
00:59:37,105 --> 00:59:39,080
What are you doing?
No, give me this!

786
00:59:39,153 --> 00:59:41,192
Let him take it.
No! No, he can't take this.

787
00:59:41,264 --> 00:59:43,152
Have I no say in this?

788
00:59:44,593 --> 00:59:46,087
Sure.
All of his stuff.

789
00:59:46,161 --> 00:59:49,063
Sure, if you wanna talk to me
now, you can have a say in it.

790
00:59:49,137 --> 00:59:51,242
Maybe you have some advice
for me. Maybe there's a tip...

791
00:59:51,313 --> 00:59:53,452
His clothes! His books!
... on the Internet

792
00:59:53,521 --> 00:59:54,830
His notebooks
with his writing?

793
00:59:54,897 --> 00:59:57,385
...that tells you
how to deal with

794
00:59:57,457 --> 00:59:58,504
Maybe they say
you should keep them...

795
00:59:58,577 --> 01:00:01,195
What are you talking about?
... hold on to them,

796
01:00:01,265 --> 01:00:04,396
Why wouldn't I be angry?
Why aren't you angry?

797
01:00:04,465 --> 01:00:06,504
Here's what I care about!
Yeah? What?

798
01:00:06,576 --> 01:00:08,486
My son is dead!

799
01:00:08,561 --> 01:00:10,982
He's not coming home to me!

800
01:00:11,057 --> 01:00:12,846
He's not coming home to me!

801
01:00:12,913 --> 01:00:15,117
I'm trying to figure out
how to live!

802
01:00:15,185 --> 01:00:16,810
How to not go crazy!

803
01:00:16,881 --> 01:00:19,336
Well, I'm not gonna
live my life knowing...

804
01:00:19,409 --> 01:00:23,304
...that our son's killer
is still out there!

805
01:00:23,377 --> 01:00:25,133
That's what I
can't live with!

806
01:00:25,201 --> 01:00:26,543
I don't see why
you can't see that!

807
01:00:26,609 --> 01:00:28,910
She needs looking after
and I need to look after her.

808
01:00:28,977 --> 01:00:32,108
If you can't help me
with that, then you get out!

809
01:00:38,385 --> 01:00:40,905
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

810
01:00:40,977 --> 01:00:42,799
Welcome to our fall concert.

811
01:00:42,864 --> 01:00:46,727
We've all worked very hard
on this, and so

812
01:01:22,865 --> 01:01:27,055
What do you get
when you cross poison ivy

813
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:28,811
A rash of good luck.

814
01:01:29,233 --> 01:01:30,248
That is correct.

815
01:01:30,321 --> 01:01:32,776
What do you call
a deer with no eyes?

816
01:01:32,849 --> 01:01:34,158
No ideer.

817
01:01:35,281 --> 01:01:38,281
What do you call a deer
with no eyes and no legs?

818
01:01:38,353 --> 01:01:39,946
Still no ideer.

819
01:01:40,625 --> 01:01:42,413
If a man speaks
in the middle of the forest

820
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:45,776
with no woman there
to hear him,

821
01:01:45,841 --> 01:01:46,986
Yes.

822
01:01:48,048 --> 01:01:49,096
Correct.

823
01:01:49,169 --> 01:01:53,260
If con is the opposite of pro,
then what is the opposite

824
01:01:54,449 --> 01:01:56,271
Congress!

825
01:01:56,337 --> 01:01:58,758
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is a draw!

826
01:02:07,248 --> 01:02:10,893
Our next performer
will be Emma Learner

827
01:02:18,993 --> 01:02:21,098
This is for my brother, Josh.

828
01:03:24,785 --> 01:03:27,654
I'm lucky to have such
smart women around me.

829
01:04:05,361 --> 01:04:07,914
It was so, so beautiful.

830
01:04:07,985 --> 01:04:09,097
Thank you, Mom.

831
01:04:09,168 --> 01:04:10,248
Thank you.

832
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:12,687
You were so good,
baby. Come here.

833
01:04:17,296 --> 01:04:19,085
Good night, Grace.
Take care.

834
01:04:19,153 --> 01:04:20,495
Not as good as you.

835
01:04:20,561 --> 01:04:22,982
So, maestro,
what's the next date?

836
01:04:23,056 --> 01:04:25,063
What, Lincoln Center
or Symphony Space?

837
01:04:25,136 --> 01:04:26,380
- Carnegie Hall?
- Dad, don't be silly.

838
01:04:26,448 --> 01:04:27,823
What? What?
I'm not being silly.

839
01:04:27,889 --> 01:04:30,442
Emma,
thank you so much.

840
01:04:30,513 --> 01:04:32,138
You're such
an inspiration.

841
01:04:32,208 --> 01:04:34,150
- Lou!
- You were wonderful.

842
01:04:36,977 --> 01:04:38,154
Lou!

843
01:04:38,224 --> 01:04:39,206
Oh, no, that's fine.

844
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:41,385
Our prayers were
with you the entire time.

845
01:04:41,456 --> 01:04:43,878
Your daughter is great.
Thank you.

846
01:04:44,784 --> 01:04:47,632
You must be very proud
of Emma tonight.

847
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:00,651
Hey, Lou!

848
01:05:12,657 --> 01:05:13,737
Lou!

849
01:05:22,097 --> 01:05:23,504
Ethan?

850
01:05:26,576 --> 01:05:31,083
Our composer's waiting.
She wants to go celebrate.

851
01:05:31,153 --> 01:05:33,292
I just feel nauseous.

852
01:05:34,416 --> 01:05:36,304
I got you a gift,
all right?

853
01:05:36,368 --> 01:05:37,481
Thanks, Dad.

854
01:05:37,553 --> 01:05:39,560
It's a Red Sox
yearbook.

855
01:05:39,633 --> 01:05:41,356
I love it.
Our boy, huh?

856
01:05:41,424 --> 01:05:43,334
Yeah.
You were great.

857
01:05:44,529 --> 01:05:46,950
All right.
All right, Norris.

858
01:05:47,024 --> 01:05:49,195
I'll see you, Ruth.
I'll see you Friday, right?

859
01:05:49,264 --> 01:05:51,053
Yeah. Friday.

860
01:05:51,857 --> 01:05:53,318
You were really good tonight.

861
01:05:53,392 --> 01:05:54,439
Thanks.

862
01:05:57,232 --> 01:05:58,923
See you.
Bye, Dad.

863
01:06:16,144 --> 01:06:17,159
Hey.

864
01:06:25,904 --> 01:06:27,944
I've been looking for you.

865
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,964
What happened tonight?

866
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:42,887
It was good.

867
01:06:44,848 --> 01:06:46,310
We were okay.

868
01:06:47,984 --> 01:06:51,083
We were okay
for a little while,

869
01:07:00,368 --> 01:07:02,987
Ethan, I don't know
how to get you back.

870
01:07:04,977 --> 01:07:06,799
Tell me what to do.

871
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:12,389
What happened?
What happened?

872
01:07:12,464 --> 01:07:14,024
Murder happened.

873
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:16,462
That's what happened.

874
01:07:21,809 --> 01:07:23,216
I love you.

875
01:07:25,008 --> 01:07:26,863
And I want to get help.

876
01:07:29,264 --> 01:07:31,403
I want us
to talk to someone.

877
01:07:33,681 --> 01:07:36,332
Okay. You wanna talk
to somebody, Grace?

878
01:07:36,976 --> 01:07:38,089
We'll talk to
whoever you want.

879
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:43,627
We can talk to the police,
lawyer, a therapist. I'll talk

880
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:46,728
Anything you want, okay?

881
01:07:49,776 --> 01:07:51,915
Now can I please be alone?

882
01:07:52,977 --> 01:07:54,919
Okay, Ethan. Okay.

883
01:08:22,033 --> 01:08:23,210
Hello?

884
01:08:24,144 --> 01:08:25,868
Oh, hi, Mr. Learner.

885
01:08:28,912 --> 01:08:30,767
No, no, I was running.

886
01:08:32,241 --> 01:08:33,702
Yeah, I'm free.

887
01:08:36,177 --> 01:08:38,697
Yeah, you wanna meet
at the office?

888
01:08:39,792 --> 01:08:40,937
Where?

889
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:05,927
Dwight. How are you?

890
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,407
Mr. Learner.

891
01:09:07,984 --> 01:09:10,123
Nice car.
Is it new?

892
01:09:10,192 --> 01:09:12,047
No. It's a rental.

893
01:09:13,296 --> 01:09:14,823
A rental?

894
01:09:17,936 --> 01:09:19,758
Been down here before?

895
01:09:20,368 --> 01:09:21,743
No, no.

896
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:24,847
Why do you ask?

897
01:09:24,912 --> 01:09:26,189
I just thought
maybe you'd come down

898
01:09:26,256 --> 01:09:27,979
and familiarize yourself
with the case.

899
01:09:28,048 --> 01:09:30,765
No. We have
a private investigator

900
01:09:30,832 --> 01:09:32,076
Yeah.

901
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:36,520
I've been down here a lot,
trying to put it together.

902
01:09:44,912 --> 01:09:47,367
This is where Josh was hit.

903
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:50,026
He came over here
to release fireflies.

904
01:09:51,152 --> 01:09:55,408
I guess he was
going to the woods

905
01:09:59,152 --> 01:10:02,534
And then from around
the bend... Here, turn around.

906
01:10:03,537 --> 01:10:05,325
From around the bend
the truck came.

907
01:10:05,392 --> 01:10:07,814
Report said
it was doing nearly 50.

908
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:12,007
Hit Josh here.

909
01:10:14,032 --> 01:10:19,434
And he hesitated
like he knew

910
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:22,920
but then just drove off.

911
01:10:26,288 --> 01:10:29,135
What kind of person
could do something like that?

912
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:35,529
I'm mean, what, was he drunk,
was he on drugs,

913
01:10:38,416 --> 01:10:42,158
How could you
just drive off?

914
01:10:50,416 --> 01:10:52,838
There's no way of knowing.

915
01:10:52,912 --> 01:10:55,530
When we get him,
we'll know.

916
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:09,356
The police have given up
on this case, haven't they?

917
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:11,654
No, not completely.

918
01:11:11,728 --> 01:11:14,630
The police are working
on a few things

919
01:11:15,888 --> 01:11:17,961
and I'm hopeful
that they'll have

920
01:11:20,112 --> 01:11:21,541
Like what?

921
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:28,229
Mr. Learner, I believe that
I'm gonna have something

922
01:11:31,536 --> 01:11:33,391
I'm tired of waiting.

923
01:11:34,512 --> 01:11:37,960
He's out there,
just laughing at me.

924
01:11:38,032 --> 01:11:39,788
Now understand this.

925
01:11:39,856 --> 01:11:41,416
I want this guy
to feel hunted.

926
01:11:41,488 --> 01:11:45,896
I want him to know that
no matter how long it takes,

927
01:11:47,216 --> 01:11:51,951
Your son, Lucas,
if somebody killed him,

928
01:11:54,128 --> 01:11:56,681
what would you
want to happen to them?

929
01:12:00,656 --> 01:12:02,958
I'd want to see him
go to prison.

930
01:12:03,024 --> 01:12:04,518
That's it?

931
01:12:05,712 --> 01:12:08,712
Knowing that he'll only
get a slap on the wrist?

932
01:12:11,088 --> 01:12:14,219
Mr. Learner, this is not
a conversation that I think

933
01:12:14,288 --> 01:12:17,005
you should be having
with your attorney.

934
01:12:20,176 --> 01:12:21,899
Maybe you're right.

935
01:12:24,976 --> 01:12:27,212
Thanks for meeting me
out here.

936
01:12:46,704 --> 01:12:49,224
Hey, Dwight.
Yeah, hey, Norris. Listen,

937
01:12:49,296 --> 01:12:50,790
Can you get her
for me, please?

938
01:12:50,864 --> 01:12:52,719
We're having a little shindig,
you know? A few friends.

939
01:12:52,784 --> 01:12:56,494
Yeah, listen, it's important.
Otherwise, I wouldn't be here.

940
01:12:56,560 --> 01:12:58,382
Sort of busy right now,
Dwight.

941
01:12:58,448 --> 01:13:01,514
Norris, I want to talk
to the mother of my kid, okay?

942
01:13:01,584 --> 01:13:04,039
All right, look,
take it easy. Just...

943
01:13:04,112 --> 01:13:05,606
Honey, is everything...
Hey, Ruth.

944
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:06,858
Dwight, what are you
doing here?

945
01:13:06,928 --> 01:13:08,237
Can I have
a word with you, please?

946
01:13:08,304 --> 01:13:09,548
It's not a good time.
We've got people over.

947
01:13:09,616 --> 01:13:11,209
Yeah, a shindig.

948
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:13,003
You can come back Saturday
if you want to talk.

949
01:13:13,072 --> 01:13:14,217
Listen, I need
a big favor from you.

950
01:13:14,288 --> 01:13:17,484
Can I just have
a word with you

951
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:20,073
Okay.

952
01:13:20,144 --> 01:13:22,086
Norris, do you mind
going to our guests?

953
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:23,687
It's okay.

954
01:13:26,224 --> 01:13:28,199
What is it, Dwight?

955
01:13:28,272 --> 01:13:32,550
Tomorrow's the first day
of the World Series. I want

956
01:13:32,624 --> 01:13:34,380
No. That's not
what the court ordered.

957
01:13:34,448 --> 01:13:37,611
Okay, can we just forget
about the whole court thing

958
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:39,949
Norris doesn't care
about the series.

959
01:13:40,016 --> 01:13:41,260
When is that
ever gonna happen again?

960
01:13:41,328 --> 01:13:42,822
I just want to
take him for the week.

961
01:13:42,896 --> 01:13:46,409
I'll get him to school
on time. Please. After that...

962
01:13:48,656 --> 01:13:51,623
After that,
I have to go away

963
01:13:51,696 --> 01:13:53,583
Jesus, Dwight,
you're always running away.

964
01:13:53,648 --> 01:13:56,582
Listen, you're always
telling me that I gotta take

965
01:13:56,656 --> 01:13:59,209
Well, that's what
I'm trying to do here, okay?

966
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:00,490
Let me have him.

967
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:05,350
Will you tell me
what's going on with you?

968
01:14:05,424 --> 01:14:09,614
I just wanna spend a week
with my son, okay?

969
01:14:11,983 --> 01:14:14,831
Jesus, Dwight. All right,
you can have him,

970
01:14:14,896 --> 01:14:16,238
Thank you.

971
01:14:17,072 --> 01:14:18,927
You know, I'm sorry.

972
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:25,127
I got to go.

973
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:26,215
Good night.

974
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:44,647
This is for you.

975
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:46,379
- Hey.
- Hi. How are you?

976
01:14:46,448 --> 01:14:49,481
Well, she played so
beautifully at the concert,

977
01:14:51,056 --> 01:14:54,089
Oh, hey, check it out.
They have a Halloween

978
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:56,494
You wanna go next week?

979
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:58,534
Let's talk about that
later, okay?

980
01:14:58,608 --> 01:15:00,713
I'll race you
to the hot dogs.

981
01:15:02,416 --> 01:15:04,837
Look at all this chocolate.

982
01:15:04,912 --> 01:15:05,894
Mr. Learner?

983
01:15:05,968 --> 01:15:08,750
No. None for me, thanks.
Please call me Ethan.

984
01:15:08,816 --> 01:15:10,605
I have some coffee
if you'd like it.

985
01:15:10,672 --> 01:15:12,527
Sure.
That would be great.

986
01:15:12,592 --> 01:15:16,105
I really hope that Emma
is going to stay

987
01:15:16,176 --> 01:15:18,827
now that
she's finished the concert.

988
01:15:18,896 --> 01:15:20,172
I'd like that.

989
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:22,313
You're so talented, honey.

990
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:25,455
Your son's quite
the Red Sox fan.

991
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:27,625
He must be excited
about the series coming up.

992
01:15:27,696 --> 01:15:30,085
Yeah. He and Dwight
are fanatics.

993
01:15:31,088 --> 01:15:32,943
He's over there right now.

994
01:15:33,008 --> 01:15:35,277
They're gonna watch
the game tonight together.

995
01:15:35,344 --> 01:15:36,871
Oh, Dwight lives nearby?

996
01:15:36,944 --> 01:15:38,089
Yeah.

997
01:15:39,824 --> 01:15:42,158
He's just over there
on Cove Road.

998
01:15:42,223 --> 01:15:45,257
He moved there
so that he could be

999
01:15:45,776 --> 01:15:47,150
Thank you.

1000
01:15:49,616 --> 01:15:52,616
These hotdogs are definitely
worse than before.

1001
01:15:55,055 --> 01:15:56,811
Worse, but better.

1002
01:15:58,864 --> 01:16:01,351
The Red Sox are gonna win
tonight, right, Dad?

1003
01:16:01,423 --> 01:16:02,405
You know it.

1004
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:04,782
So, how long were you
and Dwight together?

1005
01:16:04,848 --> 01:16:06,310
Eight years.

1006
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:10,341
Yeah, we had
a nickname for each other.

1007
01:16:10,415 --> 01:16:11,976
Nitro and Glycerin.

1008
01:16:12,048 --> 01:16:15,430
You could say
we had a kind of

1009
01:16:16,272 --> 01:16:18,312
So he had a bit of a temper?

1010
01:16:20,784 --> 01:16:22,474
Yeah. We both did.

1011
01:16:23,344 --> 01:16:24,359
More coffee?

1012
01:16:24,432 --> 01:16:27,334
No, that's all right.
We actually have to get going.

1013
01:16:27,408 --> 01:16:29,447
Can I just use
your restroom first?

1014
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:34,214
So, anyway, each one
could be a different animal.

1015
01:17:34,288 --> 01:17:37,387
Right, like if you
could have a horse, and then

1016
01:17:37,456 --> 01:17:38,950
Ready?

1017
01:17:39,024 --> 01:17:40,104
Yeah.

1018
01:17:41,232 --> 01:17:42,442
Listen.

1019
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:45,807
When the series is over,
I got to go away for a while.

1020
01:17:45,871 --> 01:17:48,238
Why?
There's just something

1021
01:17:48,304 --> 01:17:53,454
and I'm not going to
be able to see you

1022
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:55,560
So how long do you have
to go away for?

1023
01:17:55,632 --> 01:17:57,606
I don't know.
Let's wait and see.

1024
01:17:57,680 --> 01:18:00,102
Hey, we don't do so bad,
you and me.

1025
01:18:00,208 --> 01:18:01,769
We're all right.

1026
01:18:35,472 --> 01:18:40,557
Yes, hello, um...
I... I saw your ad on the Net.

1027
01:18:40,624 --> 01:18:41,704
Can I help you?

1028
01:18:41,776 --> 01:18:45,867
Yes, I'm looking for
a pistol. Something simple.

1029
01:18:47,696 --> 01:18:49,103
A revolver.

1030
01:18:57,072 --> 01:18:59,592
Hey, Dad! Sleep tight,
don't let the snakes bite!

1031
01:18:59,664 --> 01:19:02,315
Oh, that's funny.
That's funny.

1032
01:19:03,184 --> 01:19:04,972
I'll get you for that.

1033
01:19:14,608 --> 01:19:15,753
Shit.

1034
01:21:06,804 --> 01:21:08,560
Yeah!
That's it! That's it!

1035
01:21:08,660 --> 01:21:10,547
Yeah, you think
we could sweep?

1036
01:21:10,611 --> 01:21:14,124
I don't know. I think
if they could do it,

1037
01:21:14,195 --> 01:21:15,886
All right, it's bedtime.
Go on.

1038
01:21:15,955 --> 01:21:18,541
All right. Night, Dad.
Good night.

1039
01:21:18,612 --> 01:21:20,619
Get washed up.
I'll see you

1040
01:21:20,692 --> 01:21:23,507
<i>...in the middle of
this diamond at Busch Stadium</i>

1041
01:21:23,572 --> 01:21:25,427
<i>to go up three games to none.</i>

1042
01:22:36,084 --> 01:22:37,513
Mr. Learner?

1043
01:22:42,515 --> 01:22:43,660
Okay.

1044
01:22:47,987 --> 01:22:48,936
Dad?

1045
01:22:49,012 --> 01:22:51,150
That's my son.
That's my son.

1046
01:22:51,923 --> 01:22:53,931
Dad, what was that noise?

1047
01:22:54,004 --> 01:22:56,273
Lou, Lou,
it's just a stool.

1048
01:22:56,340 --> 01:22:58,729
It's a stool.
A stool fell down, honey.

1049
01:22:58,804 --> 01:23:02,251
Look, please,
let me just talk to him,

1050
01:23:03,220 --> 01:23:04,780
Okay,
we're going. Go.

1051
01:23:04,851 --> 01:23:06,378
Okay.

1052
01:23:06,804 --> 01:23:07,916
Okay.

1053
01:23:12,052 --> 01:23:13,546
Lou.

1054
01:23:13,620 --> 01:23:15,311
Dad, what was
that noise?

1055
01:23:15,380 --> 01:23:16,557
It was just the TV, okay?

1056
01:23:16,660 --> 01:23:18,416
I dropped a stool.
Go to bed, all right?

1057
01:23:18,483 --> 01:23:19,628
I have to pee anyway.

1058
01:23:19,699 --> 01:23:22,154
Oh, Jesus, Lou.
Just go to sleep, all right?

1059
01:23:22,227 --> 01:23:24,267
Dad, I really
have to pee.

1060
01:23:26,771 --> 01:23:28,560
All right, come on,
hurry, quick.

1061
01:23:28,628 --> 01:23:30,253
Come on, come on.

1062
01:23:32,724 --> 01:23:35,058
Come on, hurry up, Lou.
Come on.

1063
01:23:45,587 --> 01:23:49,362
Lou, come on, honey,
you got to get back to bed.

1064
01:23:49,427 --> 01:23:50,856
I'm coming.

1065
01:23:56,947 --> 01:23:58,125
Okay.

1066
01:23:58,611 --> 01:24:00,684
Get into bed.
Get in.

1067
01:24:01,811 --> 01:24:03,699
Good night.
Good night, Dad.

1068
01:24:03,763 --> 01:24:06,414
Get to bed.
You have a big day tomorrow.

1069
01:24:06,483 --> 01:24:07,628
I love you, Lou.

1070
01:24:07,699 --> 01:24:08,844
Love you, too.

1071
01:24:19,027 --> 01:24:20,402
Get back.

1072
01:24:21,684 --> 01:24:24,815
Outside. Just take me
out of the house.

1073
01:24:24,883 --> 01:24:26,825
Take me out of the house.

1074
01:24:29,427 --> 01:24:30,834
Look away.
Okay.

1075
01:24:30,899 --> 01:24:34,030
Put your arms together.
Go. Look away. Turn away.

1076
01:24:34,099 --> 01:24:36,336
Okay, go. That car.

1077
01:24:38,995 --> 01:24:40,751
Don't look. Just go.

1078
01:24:42,259 --> 01:24:44,463
Listen to me.
Don't do this.

1079
01:24:45,491 --> 01:24:46,701
Stay there.
Don't look at me.

1080
01:24:46,771 --> 01:24:48,910
Don't do this.
Turn around.

1081
01:24:49,683 --> 01:24:50,861
Take me to the police.

1082
01:24:50,932 --> 01:24:52,044
Take you to the police?

1083
01:24:52,115 --> 01:24:54,832
So you can weasel
your way out with

1084
01:24:54,899 --> 01:24:56,328
I swear to God,
you get in the...

1085
01:24:56,403 --> 01:24:57,679
Take me to the police,
Ethan.

1086
01:24:57,747 --> 01:24:59,308
Why? So you can fucking
deceive and manipulate?

1087
01:24:59,380 --> 01:25:01,649
Take me to the police. Take...

1088
01:26:08,755 --> 01:26:10,413
Get out.
Turn me in.

1089
01:26:10,483 --> 01:26:12,010
Just turn me in!

1090
01:26:12,819 --> 01:26:13,997
Get out.

1091
01:26:18,771 --> 01:26:21,804
Oh, God, don't shoot me.
Please don't shoot me.

1092
01:26:23,827 --> 01:26:27,373
Get out. Out!

1093
01:26:28,179 --> 01:26:30,001
Get out! Out!

1094
01:26:30,068 --> 01:26:31,016
Please don't shoot.

1095
01:26:31,091 --> 01:26:34,058
You fucking animal!
Get out or I'll kill you

1096
01:26:34,131 --> 01:26:35,473
Get out!

1097
01:26:36,788 --> 01:26:38,675
Come on, it was an accident.

1098
01:26:38,739 --> 01:26:41,423
Shut up. Shut up! Go.
Jesus Christ!

1099
01:26:47,571 --> 01:26:49,229
It was an accident.
It wasn't an accident.

1100
01:26:49,299 --> 01:26:51,023
You don't drive away
from an accident!

1101
01:26:51,092 --> 01:26:52,040
You just left!

1102
01:26:52,115 --> 01:26:53,391
I was scared!

1103
01:26:58,259 --> 01:27:00,845
I'm telling you,
don't do this.

1104
01:27:00,915 --> 01:27:04,330
Don't ruin your life
the way I've ruined mine.

1105
01:27:04,403 --> 01:27:05,930
Turn around.

1106
01:27:11,379 --> 01:27:13,419
You robbed me
of my life.

1107
01:27:14,132 --> 01:27:19,216
You left my boy
on the side of the road

1108
01:27:21,587 --> 01:27:23,921
You have ruined my family!

1109
01:27:26,227 --> 01:27:30,504
And you look at me in the face
and you deceive me

1110
01:27:32,179 --> 01:27:34,088
You deserve to die.

1111
01:27:34,163 --> 01:27:35,505
You killed my son!

1112
01:27:35,571 --> 01:27:37,197
You killed my son!

1113
01:27:40,723 --> 01:27:42,610
Stop it. Stop it!

1114
01:27:54,067 --> 01:27:57,100
It's over. It's over.

1115
01:28:06,643 --> 01:28:10,767
Get up. Get up. Get up!

1116
01:28:30,739 --> 01:28:32,746
You want me to kill myself?

1117
01:28:34,068 --> 01:28:36,107
Tell me to do it! Tell me!

1118
01:28:36,179 --> 01:28:39,660
Not a fucking day goes by
where I don't see

1119
01:28:39,731 --> 01:28:42,960
hitting my car
and going off into the dark!

1120
01:28:44,755 --> 01:28:46,643
I wish it were me.

1121
01:28:47,923 --> 01:28:50,792
Tell me to do it.
Please, tell me to do it.

1122
01:28:55,892 --> 01:28:58,347
Please, tell me to do it.

1123
01:29:03,091 --> 01:29:04,335
Please.

1124
01:29:05,939 --> 01:29:09,387
I'm dead anyway.
I'm dead.

1125
01:29:22,739 --> 01:29:25,554
Oh, God,
please don't leave me here!

1126
01:29:28,755 --> 01:29:32,781
Please forgive me.
Please forgive me.

1127
01:29:34,291 --> 01:29:35,633
I'm sorry.

1128
01:29:37,939 --> 01:29:39,346
I can't.

1129
01:29:40,403 --> 01:29:42,291
I can't. Please.

1130
01:30:38,131 --> 01:30:41,131
I miss him so much.

1131
01:30:42,387 --> 01:30:43,532
I know.

1132
01:30:45,011 --> 01:30:49,615
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

1133
01:30:55,027 --> 01:30:56,588
Let's go inside.

1134
01:31:05,459 --> 01:31:07,433
I left that night because...

1135
01:31:09,363 --> 01:31:12,396
...I was really afraid
that I was going to lose you.

1136
01:31:15,507 --> 01:31:17,197
That's no excuse.

1137
01:31:18,547 --> 01:31:20,335
What I did was wrong.

1138
01:31:21,587 --> 01:31:23,726
I'm going to be
going to prison

1139
01:31:23,795 --> 01:31:25,966
and I deserve to go to prison.

1140
01:31:27,859 --> 01:31:29,834
I just want you
to remember that

1141
01:31:29,907 --> 01:31:33,801
these last days that
we had together

1142
01:31:35,731 --> 01:31:37,771
and I feel like
I've been able to be

1143
01:31:37,843 --> 01:31:39,883
that you really deserve.

1144
01:31:41,587 --> 01:31:46,322
I guess what I'm just trying
to say is that I'm sorry.
