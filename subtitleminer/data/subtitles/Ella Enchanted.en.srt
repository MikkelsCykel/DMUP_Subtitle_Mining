<i>Fairy tales tell,
as their labels imply,</i>

2
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:31,657
<i>stories of magic, of creatures that fly.</i>

3
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:35,035
<i>With giants and dragons
and ogres and elves,</i>

4
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:39,039
<i>and inanimate objects
that speak for themselves.</i>

5
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:07,317
<i>There's romance and danger
and plotting of schemes.</i>

6
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:13,031
<i>There's good guys and bad guys
and some guys in between.</i>

7
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:19,413
<i>A fairy tale also reveals some sort of truth,</i>

8
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:23,083
<i>the perils of choices we face in our youth.</i>

9
00:01:25,878 --> 00:01:29,590
But our story today is different in theme,

10
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:33,760
for our hero had no choice,
or so it would seem.

11
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:45,355
<i>It starts with a fairy bestowing a spell.</i>

12
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:50,402
<i>This one's for a baby named Ella of Frell.</i>

13
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:01,538
Now, now, Ella. Mother's here.

14
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:07,586
There, now. Oh, dear Ella.

15
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:16,178
Oh, it's nothing a little burping won't cure.

16
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,140
- Up.
- There, now.

17
00:02:20,224 --> 00:02:22,935
Come on. All the way.

18
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,480
I gotta work on that.

19
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:27,981
<i>Whoa!</i>

20
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:30,234
<i>Hello, ladies!</i>

21
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:31,860
Lucinda!

22
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:36,782
- She gives the worst gifts.
- Not if she can't find the baby.

23
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:39,034
<i>Whoa!</i>

24
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:45,249
Ah!

25
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:49,294
Lucinda here. Fairy par excellence.

26
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:53,090
Now, where's the baby?

27
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:56,260
- Out walking.
- At her grandmother's.

28
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:58,512
- At her grandmother's.
- Out for a walk.

29
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:04,059
- She's walking, at her grandmother's.
- Either way, as you see, she's not here.

30
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:09,982
Oh, look. She's back.

31
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,111
All right.

32
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:18,991
What shall we give
this beautiful little child today?

33
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,618
- What's her name again?
- Ella.

34
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,661
Ah.

35
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:25,163
Ella of Frell.

36
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:30,544
Not a very well-behaved
little stinker, is she?

37
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,839
Quiet, please. I can't concentrate here.

38
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:38,844
Ella of Frell,
I give you the gift of obedience.

39
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:42,681
Now, go to sleep.

40
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:48,228
Now, wake up.

41
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:56,403
- lsn't it wonderful?
- No, it's terrible.

42
00:03:56,486 --> 00:04:00,199
It's a terrible gift to have to do
what you're told. Take it back.

43
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:02,534
I have a no-return policy.

44
00:04:02,618 --> 00:04:08,248
And if you're going to be ungrateful, I can
always turn her into a squirrel instead.

45
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:11,502
- A squirrel?
- No, obedience is a lovely gift.

46
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:14,463
Besides, you should thank me.

47
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:19,468
I've just given you the perfect child.

48
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:29,478
In spite of the spell,
Ella grew up strong of mind.

49
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:34,650
Her gift made her obedient,
but her heart made her kind.

50
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:36,902
Why don't you go back
to where you came from?

51
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:40,614
- Yeah.
- Areida. What a stupid name.

52
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:44,618
- Nobody wants you here.
- I do.

53
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:47,704
Bite me.

54
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:51,667
Did you just see what Ella did?

55
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:00,634
I made your favorite,
so dig in and stuff your face.

56
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,719
I'm gonna get forks.

57
00:05:05,848 --> 00:05:08,183
Sweetie, stop.

58
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:13,063
I always knew
something was wrong with me.

59
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:15,941
Can't you take the spell back?
You're a fairy.

60
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:18,068
I'm only a household fairy, honey.

61
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:21,029
Besides, according to fairy guidelines,

62
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:26,243
only the fairy who gave you the gift
can take it back, and we've begged her.

63
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:29,621
Not only that, but she said
she'd turn your mother into a squirrel

64
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:33,584
and take away my eternal youth
if we ever asked her again.

65
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,919
It's not fair.

66
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:39,840
I know, darling. I know.

67
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:43,719
<i>So Ella now knew
why she'd always obeyed.</i>

68
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:47,181
<i>But she never stopped fighting
to have things her way.</i>

69
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:50,851
Ella! Come practice your mandolin.

70
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:55,022
Fine, but I'll take
my own sweet time doing it.

71
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:57,024
Hurry up, now.

72
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:03,447
<i>As she struggled
to find a way out of her gift,</i>

73
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:08,535
<i>she had no way of knowing
something worse was adrift.</i>

74
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:10,996
Please get well, Mother.

75
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:13,790
Listen to me.

76
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:18,295
Only Mandy and I know about the gift.

77
00:06:18,337 --> 00:06:21,507
We've never even told your father.

78
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:25,886
And you must never tell anyone else.

79
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,933
- I don't want anyone using it against you.
- Mother, please.

80
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:36,730
Remember, no matter
what anyone says or tells you to do,

81
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:41,151
Look to yourself, Ella.

82
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:46,657
What's inside you
is stronger than any spell.

83
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:04,716
Take this, then I'll always be with you.

84
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,780
Ella.

85
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:29,908
Your father would like to speak to you.

86
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:34,955
- You're married?
- She has money, Ella.

87
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:37,291
And she's very fond of my title.

88
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:39,877
It was either get married or sell the house.

89
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,255
You'll adore Dame Olga,
and her two daughters.

90
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:45,924
She'll make a wonderful mother.

91
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:48,385
Well, a motherlike figure.

92
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:52,139
Look, I'm sure
you'll all be the best of friends.

93
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:57,144
Whoa!

94
00:08:01,607 --> 00:08:03,567
Is this the right address?

95
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,945
There must be some mistake.

96
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:09,031
My dear, welcome.

97
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:14,286
And these must be your lovely daughters.

98
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:18,832
My precious Hattie and my special Olive.

99
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,627
Oh.

100
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:24,922
- And you must be Ella.
- Pleased to meet you.

101
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:28,967
Yes. The house looks delightful.

102
00:08:29,051 --> 00:08:31,970
But I do seem to remember
that at the noblemen's convention

103
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:34,306
you said that you lived in a castle.

104
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:37,434
No, I said a man's home is his castle.

105
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:41,271
Hi. I'm Ella. Welcome to Frell.

106
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:45,275
What's with the prince pinups?

107
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:49,321
Hattie's president
of the Prince Char fan club.

108
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:55,285
Char and his uncle are responsible
for the segregation of the kingdom.

109
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:58,205
So? He's dreamy.

110
00:08:59,832 --> 00:09:02,334
Is this hutch meant to be a closet?

111
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,965
It's pathetic.

112
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:11,051
My clothes need more room than this.

113
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:15,848
- We'll have to use yours.
- Wha...?

114
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:18,684
Show it to us.

115
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:28,735
Oh.

116
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:32,739
It's so... quaint.

117
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:38,120
Almost like, well, it's just ugly, isn't it?

118
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,835
There's no room in here, either.

119
00:09:44,877 --> 00:09:48,755
We're gonna have to throw out
some of your gowns to make room.

120
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,885
- Wait. Get away from there!
- You get away.

121
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:57,681
Oh.

122
00:09:57,723 --> 00:10:01,602
What's this? I do actually like this.

123
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:03,770
Please don't touch it. It was my mother's.

124
00:10:03,854 --> 00:10:05,856
- Can I have it?
- No.

125
00:10:05,898 --> 00:10:08,150
Oh.

126
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:11,403
It can be your welcome gift to me.

127
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:14,823
Come on, hand it over.

128
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:18,702
Oh.

129
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,787
Aren't you accommodating.

130
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:28,003
The second I sell the last of these,
I'll be back. I promise.

131
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:31,006
I know it's not a great job,
not even a good job -

132
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:35,844
OK, even a monkey could do it -
but we need the money, Ella.

133
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:40,390
- I'll miss you, Father.
- I'll miss you, too.

134
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:52,945
Hey, Olive, we should call her
Ella the Smella from Frella.

135
00:10:57,616 --> 00:11:01,245
Elves, giants, ogres and humans
used to exist in harmony,

136
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:05,624
but when King Florian was killed,
allegedly by an ogre,

137
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:10,254
Sir Edgar saw it as an opportunity to exile
all nonhuman creatures to the forest,

138
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:12,840
keeping their land for himself.

139
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:17,761
Passionately put, Ella.
Give yourself a pat on the back.

140
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:20,931
Hattie?

141
00:11:20,973 --> 00:11:22,975
Oh.

142
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:31,316
What my unworthy opponent fails to realize

143
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:36,488
is Sir Edgar has done a fantastic job.

144
00:11:36,572 --> 00:11:38,574
He has driven the ogres out,

145
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:43,120
and he has put giants and elves to work
as laborers and entertainers.

146
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:45,747
Therefore, if it weren't for him,

147
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:49,585
we wouldn't have today's
thriving free-enterprise system.

148
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:54,131
It's only free because we've enslaved the
poor creatures and they work for nothing.

149
00:11:54,173 --> 00:11:59,928
Edgar is a monster, and I don't hold out
much hope for his nephew, either.

150
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:04,016
Well, that shows what you know,
aka nothing.

151
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:08,270
Prince Char will be the greatest king ever.

152
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:11,982
- Right, girls?
- Yeah.

153
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:16,653
I wonder if my opponent has based
her opinion on the prince's politics

154
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:19,823
or how cute she thinks his butt is.

155
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:25,329
Admit you're stupid
and don't know what you're talking about.

156
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:28,373
I'm stupid and I don't know
what I'm talking about.

157
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:30,918
Ella?

158
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:33,545
Anyway, in conclusion...

159
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:35,506
Hold your tongue, Ella.

160
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:37,883
Ella!

161
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:42,179
My tongue itches.

162
00:12:42,221 --> 00:12:46,892
If you're not going to take this
seriously, I declare Hattie the winner.

163
00:12:50,229 --> 00:12:52,189
Ya!

164
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:04,326
Uncle, do I have to go to this mall opening?

165
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:08,789
As heir to the throne,
it's your royal responsibility, Char.

166
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:13,293
- You are a public figure, after all.
- Yes, but you're the one in charge.

167
00:13:13,377 --> 00:13:16,296
Only for a little while longer.

168
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,715
Your coronation is next week.

169
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:21,844
You need to be out there
with the people, Char.

170
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:27,266
Yes, shaking hands and kissing babies.

171
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:31,895
Exactly, Heston.
So the people can learn to trust us.

172
00:13:31,937 --> 00:13:33,939
What's not to trust?

173
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:36,233
Nothing.

174
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:41,238
But while you've been away at school,
Char, the kingdom has been under siege.

175
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:45,158
In your absence,
the ogres have become impossible.

176
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:51,957
He's right. Even the giants have become
more and more treacherous.

177
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:55,085
But the giants have always been peaceful.

178
00:13:55,127 --> 00:14:00,674
The ogres were peaceful too,
until they ripped your father to shreds.

179
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:04,469
And I promised your father,
should anything happen to him,

180
00:14:04,553 --> 00:14:08,265
I would take care of you and the kingdom.

181
00:14:08,307 --> 00:14:13,562
And, well, I've kept my promise, haven't l?

182
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:15,647
Whoa!

183
00:14:15,731 --> 00:14:19,693
Likewise, you must keep
your promise to the people.

184
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:25,490
Now, let's put on a smile.
Remember, image is everything.

185
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:40,380
Thank you.

186
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:43,342
Thank you. Thank you.

187
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:48,096
It's wonderful to be here
in your charming town of... Frell.

188
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,682
Prince Charmont and l...

189
00:14:50,766 --> 00:14:53,685
We want Char! We want Char!

190
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:58,065
We want Char! We want Char!
We want Char!

191
00:14:58,148 --> 00:15:03,570
Now it is my great pleasure to welcome
my nephew, Prince Charmont.

192
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:16,333
- Say no to ogrecide!
- Stop the giant land grab!

193
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:19,086
- Say no to ogrecide!
- Stop the giant land grab!

194
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:21,839
- Say no to ogrecide!
- Stop the giant land grab!

195
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:26,385
- Say no to ogrecide!
- Ella! You are embarrassing us!

196
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:30,222
Go home now.

197
00:15:30,264 --> 00:15:32,641
I have to go. I'm sorry.

198
00:15:34,393 --> 00:15:36,228
I love you, Prince Char!

199
00:15:39,231 --> 00:15:42,025
Hey! Prince Char!

200
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:46,113
- Are you a fast runner?
- Not particularly, no. Why?

201
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:48,198
Get him!

202
00:15:59,585 --> 00:16:01,920
- Ow!
- Shush, shush, shush!

203
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:14,349
- Prince Charmont.
- Please, call me... call me Char.

204
00:16:14,433 --> 00:16:16,768
Sorry about that.
Occupational hazard.

205
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:20,147
- Allow me.
- I don't need your chivalry, thanks.

206
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:23,984
And I've no intention of curtsying,
either, so forget it.

207
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:29,031
You can curtsy or not. That's your choice.
There's really nothing I can do about it.

208
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:31,825
Except have you beheaded,
but that seems a bit extreme.

209
00:16:31,909 --> 00:16:34,495
Charming. Why don't you do
what your people usually do?

210
00:16:34,578 --> 00:16:37,581
Steal my land and destroy my livelihood.
If you'll excuse me...

211
00:16:37,623 --> 00:16:40,292
Wait a second. Come back here.

212
00:16:44,463 --> 00:16:45,422
Hm?

213
00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:47,799
What is your name?

214
00:16:47,883 --> 00:16:50,260
Ella of Frell.

215
00:16:50,302 --> 00:16:53,055
Well, Ella of Frell,

216
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:57,768
you're the first maiden I've met
who hasn't swooned at the sight of me.

217
00:16:57,851 --> 00:17:00,854
Then maybe I've done you some good.

218
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:06,818
Look, I've never stolen
anyone's land or livelihood.

219
00:17:06,902 --> 00:17:11,031
I want peace in the kingdom
as much as anyone.

220
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:14,868
So you have a new plan
once you take the crown?

221
00:17:14,952 --> 00:17:17,287
Well...

222
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:21,208
Sort of. Of course,
I couldn't reveal it to a subject.

223
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,585
That's what I thought.
You're all just the same.

224
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:26,922
You care more about your fan club
and your next jousting tournament.

225
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:32,010
No, actually, I've never been comfortable
with the whole adoring fan club thing.

226
00:17:32,094 --> 00:17:35,389
Perhaps that's why I find
your obvious disdain for me so refreshing.

227
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:39,560
Obvious? And I was trying
so hard to hide it.

228
00:17:43,856 --> 00:17:46,692
Where's my purse? It's back there.

229
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:49,945
Wait right there. I will get it.

230
00:18:04,376 --> 00:18:06,962
Prince Charmont!

231
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:16,930
Prince Charmont!

232
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:21,393
Your Highness.

233
00:18:25,898 --> 00:18:29,651
Are you crazy? Why didn't you move?

234
00:18:29,735 --> 00:18:35,616
I would have... were it not for your apparent
fascination with knocking me to the ground.

235
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:38,577
That's the second time today, you realize.

236
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,997
I'll try and be more considerate
next time I'm saving you.

237
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,043
Next time? What makes you think
we'll see each other again?

238
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:48,086
Well, won't we?

239
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:51,215
No.

240
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:55,511
Ella of Frell, you are not like other girls.

241
00:18:57,262 --> 00:18:59,389
You have no idea.

242
00:18:59,473 --> 00:19:01,975
Ella, come here.

243
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:12,945
Shouldn't you be at home
cleaning the fireplace, huh?

244
00:19:13,028 --> 00:19:15,489
Stop flirting with him.

245
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:18,909
It's me he's going to have at his coronation.

246
00:19:18,951 --> 00:19:23,247
Yeah, in the middle of the table
with an apple in your mouth.

247
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:26,291
Go back to the mall with Olive.

248
00:19:29,878 --> 00:19:32,422
- Ella.
- Oh.

249
00:19:32,464 --> 00:19:35,259
Don't bother with her. Ugh.

250
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:40,764
I'm the one you want.
I know everything about you.

251
00:19:40,848 --> 00:19:43,642
I've got posters of you, and pictures.

252
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:46,270
And when we used to live in Lamia,

253
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:52,901
I used to stand outside your castle and
watch you turn your lights on and off.

254
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:57,865
Tell Ella I'll be in touch.

255
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:04,454
Right. I'll see to that.

256
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:06,874
- Where were you?
- Oh.

257
00:20:06,957 --> 00:20:09,209
- I met the prince.
- You met the prince?

258
00:20:09,293 --> 00:20:11,962
I don't wanna talk about it.
Olive and Hattie were there.

259
00:20:12,004 --> 00:20:14,798
Hattie. Why do you always do
what Hattie tells you to do?

260
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,884
- I don't.
- Yes, you do.

261
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:19,219
- I don't.
- Tell the truth.

262
00:20:19,303 --> 00:20:20,804
Oh, I do.

263
00:20:20,888 --> 00:20:24,474
Olive, have you noticed
anything strange about Ella?

264
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:26,977
No, not really.

265
00:20:27,019 --> 00:20:32,024
Have you noticed it gets darker at night,
then lighter when the sun comes up?

266
00:20:32,107 --> 00:20:34,985
- That's because of Ella?
- Never mind.

267
00:20:35,027 --> 00:20:38,071
- You've been acting odd, even for you.
- What do you mean?

268
00:20:38,155 --> 00:20:41,366
- Oh... Don't let her see me.
- That's what I mean.

269
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:42,993
Aha.

270
00:20:43,035 --> 00:20:47,498
- Areida, no!
- Ella, come here.

271
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:49,583
I have to go.

272
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:57,007
- What?
- I need you to do me a little favor.

273
00:20:57,049 --> 00:20:58,884
Take that.

274
00:21:01,011 --> 00:21:04,389
Cool! Let me try! Take that.

275
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:08,185
And that potion bottle.

276
00:21:08,227 --> 00:21:10,354
OK! OK, that's enough.

277
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:15,984
I think that's for me to say, Ella.
We need one more thing.

278
00:21:16,068 --> 00:21:18,028
Take those.

279
00:21:21,907 --> 00:21:26,495
- Please don't make me do this.
- Well, since you said please...

280
00:21:26,578 --> 00:21:30,249
No. Take them. Take them!

281
00:21:32,209 --> 00:21:34,086
Run!

282
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:37,047
Stop that girl!

283
00:21:37,089 --> 00:21:40,717
Buy a squirrel sandwich.
Get 'em while they're hot.

284
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:42,886
Here. Keep the change.

285
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:44,972
Excuse me.

286
00:21:50,435 --> 00:21:52,896
Excuse me. Coming through.

287
00:21:52,938 --> 00:21:55,941
Try our new perfume.

288
00:21:56,024 --> 00:21:58,110
Thanks.

289
00:21:59,987 --> 00:22:02,906
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!

290
00:22:12,124 --> 00:22:13,959
Ella, bravo!

291
00:22:17,546 --> 00:22:19,548
Freeze!

292
00:22:28,932 --> 00:22:31,143
Put your hands together.

293
00:22:32,895 --> 00:22:35,230
You're under arrest.

294
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:42,613
A felon in my own family.
I could die from embarrassment.

295
00:22:42,654 --> 00:22:44,907
Promises, promises.

296
00:22:45,908 --> 00:22:49,203
- You are a disgrace.
- Maybe she was put up to it.

297
00:22:52,456 --> 00:22:56,835
Mandy's right, Mother. We were there.

298
00:22:56,877 --> 00:22:59,671
It really wasn't poor Ella's fault at all.

299
00:22:59,755 --> 00:23:01,882
She was forced to do it.

300
00:23:02,841 --> 00:23:06,345
So, Ella, who put you up to it?

301
00:23:06,428 --> 00:23:09,181
- Tell her it was Areida.
- Ar...

302
00:23:09,223 --> 00:23:13,393
I'm waiting. Tell me who's to blame.

303
00:23:15,521 --> 00:23:17,314
Areida.

304
00:23:17,356 --> 00:23:20,359
Areida! I might have guessed it.

305
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,405
- You are forbidden ever to see her again.
- What?

306
00:23:25,489 --> 00:23:26,865
Ella?

307
00:23:26,907 --> 00:23:29,326
How dare she come here now?

308
00:23:29,368 --> 00:23:33,831
Answer the door and tell her
that you never want to see her again.

309
00:23:33,914 --> 00:23:37,376
And tell her you could never be friends
with an Ayorthian.

310
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:40,379
- Dame Olga, there must be some mistake.
- Please, Dame Olga.

311
00:23:40,462 --> 00:23:43,298
Don't argue. Just do it.

312
00:23:48,512 --> 00:23:51,223
Thank goodness you're all right.

313
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,687
What's wrong?

314
00:24:00,524 --> 00:24:03,735
I never wanna see you again.

315
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:07,865
Ha-ha. Very funny.

316
00:24:13,078 --> 00:24:16,039
I don't understand.
We're best friends.

317
00:24:22,921 --> 00:24:27,551
I could never be friends with an Ayorthian.

318
00:24:31,471 --> 00:24:33,640
Just go.

319
00:24:41,857 --> 00:24:44,151
I've done terrible things before, Mandy,

320
00:24:44,234 --> 00:24:48,822
but this is the worst thing
the curse has ever made me do.

321
00:24:51,992 --> 00:24:54,620
I've gotta do it.

322
00:24:54,703 --> 00:24:59,750
I have got to find Lucinda
and get her to take back the curse.

323
00:25:02,085 --> 00:25:04,087
You're right.

324
00:25:05,714 --> 00:25:08,008
I have something to show you.

325
00:25:08,091 --> 00:25:11,094
This is gonna help you find her.

326
00:25:11,762 --> 00:25:14,473
I should have told you
about this years ago.

327
00:25:14,556 --> 00:25:17,518
- But I was a little embarrassed.
- Embarrassed? How?

328
00:25:17,601 --> 00:25:22,689
Well, as you know,
I'm not the most talented fairy.

329
00:25:23,649 --> 00:25:29,947
Anyway, this book...
is my boyfriend, Benny.

330
00:25:30,572 --> 00:25:31,949
Hey.

331
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:35,619
Pleased to meet you.
Pleased to meet anyone, quite frankly.

332
00:25:35,661 --> 00:25:39,706
You're the first introduction
I've had in 20 years.

333
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:43,168
- I've never seen anything like this.
- I know. No one has.

334
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:47,047
And I don't want them to,
cos then they might take him away.

335
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:53,762
It was an accident. I was just trying a spell
to trim his hair, and it went a little askew.

336
00:25:53,846 --> 00:25:56,974
I would have left her ages ago,
except I love her so darn much.

337
00:25:57,057 --> 00:25:59,393
Plus, I have no legs.

338
00:25:59,476 --> 00:26:01,979
I love you, too, my little Pooky Pages.

339
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:04,231
Not as much as I love you, Cuddlebuns.

340
00:26:04,314 --> 00:26:06,900
- I love you more.
- OK.

341
00:26:06,984 --> 00:26:09,695
Lots of love. Moving on.

342
00:26:10,195 --> 00:26:13,073
Well, I want you to take him with you.

343
00:26:13,157 --> 00:26:16,660
You mean I'm getting out of here?
Beyond these four walls?

344
00:26:16,702 --> 00:26:20,747
There are so many places in my pages
I've been wanting to visit.

345
00:26:20,831 --> 00:26:23,500
Wow. What is all this?

346
00:26:23,542 --> 00:26:26,837
- He knows everything.
- Thanks, sweetie, but not everything.

347
00:26:26,879 --> 00:26:29,256
If I did, I'd be a lot thicker.

348
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:31,341
Can he show me anything about Lucinda?

349
00:26:31,383 --> 00:26:36,096
- Can I show you anything about Lucinda?
- Watch this.

350
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,182
Show me Lucinda.

351
00:26:38,265 --> 00:26:40,100
Ta-da!

352
00:26:40,184 --> 00:26:42,853
Cool trick.

353
00:26:43,395 --> 00:26:46,440
Now, which Crockery Barn?
They're all over the kingdom.

354
00:26:46,523 --> 00:26:47,482
Ah.

355
00:26:47,566 --> 00:26:51,612
That's the glitch. He can't tell you where
a person is. He can just show you pictures.

356
00:26:51,695 --> 00:26:54,907
Like a crystal ball or a magic mirror.

357
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:58,744
Everything is so huge.
Is that a wedding registry?

358
00:26:59,578 --> 00:27:02,498
Duh! They're in Giantville.

359
00:27:03,415 --> 00:27:06,376
Look, she's going
to a wedding in Giantville.

360
00:27:06,418 --> 00:27:10,297
- Benny, we're going to Giantville.
- How exciting.

361
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:14,426
Ella, the girls and I need bouquets
for our portrait sitting tomorrow.

362
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:16,512
Go and pick some.

363
00:27:43,247 --> 00:27:45,249
Oh, my God!

364
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:51,755
So, as her stepfamily scratched
their newly found itches,

365
00:27:51,797 --> 00:27:56,009
Ella was off, glad to be rid of the... witches.

366
00:27:57,636 --> 00:27:59,972
Benny, can you show me a map
of the Forest of Pim?

367
00:28:00,055 --> 00:28:02,057
Of course.

368
00:28:03,684 --> 00:28:06,061
Whoa.

369
00:28:07,271 --> 00:28:11,441
According to this map,
if we head due east towards Monster Rock,

370
00:28:11,525 --> 00:28:13,569
we can cut half a day off our journey.

371
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:17,823
- What was that?
- Probably something that wants to eat us.

372
00:28:17,906 --> 00:28:19,825
Ouch!

373
00:28:19,867 --> 00:28:22,119
Somebody help me!

374
00:28:22,161 --> 00:28:25,789
- Wait a minute.
- Sing soprano, little man!

375
00:28:28,959 --> 00:28:30,043
Missed!

376
00:28:30,127 --> 00:28:33,297
What do you think
you're doing to that poor elf?

377
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,464
Oh.

378
00:28:34,548 --> 00:28:37,509
Who's this who thinks she's so tough?

379
00:28:39,636 --> 00:28:45,767
Look, I think it's only fair to warn you that
I'm practiced in the ancient art... of origami.

380
00:28:47,853 --> 00:28:49,855
Paper folding?

381
00:28:49,938 --> 00:28:52,482
I was hoping
you wouldn't know what that was.

382
00:28:52,524 --> 00:28:55,861
Don't let him scare you, sweetheart!
Kick his butt!

383
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:59,573
Don't let her do that.

384
00:28:59,656 --> 00:29:02,117
Now rabbit punch.

385
00:29:03,744 --> 00:29:08,290
Combo. Kneel. Front-step kick.
Dragon-roundhouse kick.

386
00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:11,627
This chick is nuts!

387
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:14,171
Let's get outta here.

388
00:29:14,213 --> 00:29:16,715
I think I'm gonna puke.

389
00:29:18,133 --> 00:29:20,385
Let me help you with that.

390
00:29:20,427 --> 00:29:23,722
I am gonna need
so much therapy after this.

391
00:29:24,598 --> 00:29:25,516
Oh!

392
00:29:25,557 --> 00:29:28,769
- Are you OK?
- No, I am not OK!

393
00:29:28,852 --> 00:29:32,022
I think I broke something,
or dislocated it, or...

394
00:29:33,065 --> 00:29:36,193
No, just a crick. Slannen of Pim.

395
00:29:37,569 --> 00:29:40,405
Ella of Frell. Nice to meet you.

396
00:29:43,408 --> 00:29:48,747
Well, if you're OK,
then I have to be going, but good luck.

397
00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:53,585
You're going? You can't walk in this wood
on your own. How about a bite to eat?

398
00:29:53,669 --> 00:29:56,338
That's very sweet,
but I'm on a tight schedule.

399
00:29:56,421 --> 00:30:00,050
Fine. Message received,
Miss "l Think I'm All That".

400
00:30:00,092 --> 00:30:03,554
- That's not what I meant at all.
- I extend the hand of friendship...

401
00:30:03,595 --> 00:30:06,640
- I am on a tight schedule. Were I not...
- Everybody's busy...

402
00:30:06,723 --> 00:30:11,812
- ...I would love to have dinner with you.
- Great! I've got a coupon.

403
00:30:16,525 --> 00:30:18,944
Slannen.

404
00:30:19,778 --> 00:30:24,032
If this is where you live,
why are we sneaking around?

405
00:30:24,116 --> 00:30:27,327
If they spot you, you'll be sorry.

406
00:30:27,411 --> 00:30:30,289
You know how all elves
are forced to sing and dance?

407
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:32,833
Yeah. So?

408
00:30:33,792 --> 00:30:36,420
Visitors!

409
00:30:36,503 --> 00:30:39,631
- Places, everyone.
- One, two, three, four!

410
00:30:39,715 --> 00:30:41,967
Run for it!

411
00:31:03,405 --> 00:31:05,741
Where are we going?

412
00:31:06,867 --> 00:31:08,869
I said get lost!

413
00:31:13,499 --> 00:31:14,833
Leave us alone!

414
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:18,003
Peace and quiet at last.

415
00:31:23,342 --> 00:31:24,468
Hit the road.

416
00:31:26,595 --> 00:31:28,597
Get outta here!

417
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,641
I need this.

418
00:31:30,724 --> 00:31:34,394
What is this, anyway? Ella's secret diary.

419
00:31:35,854 --> 00:31:39,149
Yes. Why don't you like music?

420
00:31:39,191 --> 00:31:44,696
That's right. Because elves are supposed
to be so happy and joyful all the time.

421
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:47,533
Singing and dancing for the man.

422
00:31:47,616 --> 00:31:49,827
I don't wanna be an entertainer.

423
00:31:49,868 --> 00:31:51,995
I wanna be a...

424
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:53,747
- What?
- Nothing.

425
00:31:53,831 --> 00:31:55,666
- What were you gonna say?
- It's silly.

426
00:31:55,707 --> 00:31:58,043
Please tell me.

427
00:31:58,126 --> 00:32:00,796
I wanna be a lawyer.

428
00:32:01,588 --> 00:32:04,049
- I guess in small-claims court.
- What is that?

429
00:32:04,132 --> 00:32:06,134
Nothing.

430
00:32:06,218 --> 00:32:09,346
- Why can't you be a lawyer?
- Hello?

431
00:32:09,429 --> 00:32:12,015
Elf.

432
00:32:12,057 --> 00:32:16,186
I forgot. The elfin restrictions
Sir Edgar passed.

433
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:20,858
No elf shall be engaged in any occupation
other than singing, juggling

434
00:32:20,899 --> 00:32:23,735
and/or tomfoolery.

435
00:32:23,819 --> 00:32:26,363
They're never gonna let me
go to law school.

436
00:32:26,405 --> 00:32:28,740
I'm never gonna get my day in court,

437
00:32:28,782 --> 00:32:31,118
never gonna stand
in front of the judge and say

438
00:32:31,201 --> 00:32:34,663
"You're out of order!
Permission to approach the bench?"

439
00:32:34,746 --> 00:32:36,748
- "l object!"
- No, I object.

440
00:32:36,832 --> 00:32:40,377
- I heard it there. It's coming from the book.
- No, it's not.

441
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,588
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's not.

442
00:32:43,547 --> 00:32:47,217
Great. I knew it. A talking book.

443
00:32:47,301 --> 00:32:52,264
Good. Because for a minute there,
I thought I was going crazy.

444
00:33:04,067 --> 00:33:07,446
- What are you doing with Ella's things?
- Just a little tidying up.

445
00:33:07,529 --> 00:33:11,158
- What's that?
- What? Nothing. It's personal.

446
00:33:15,329 --> 00:33:18,415
A letter for Ella?

447
00:33:18,457 --> 00:33:24,087
The prince's coronation ball.
He's invited that insolent little snip?

448
00:33:24,171 --> 00:33:28,133
Girls, go and dust off your ball gowns
and pack your bags.

449
00:33:28,217 --> 00:33:33,514
I think I may have found you
another chance at your future husband.

450
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,937
Yes!

451
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:49,863
So you can really show me anything
anywhere in the kingdom?

452
00:33:49,947 --> 00:33:54,827
You're kind of like a walking, talking
encyclopedia, except for the walking part.

453
00:33:54,868 --> 00:33:56,870
- Come on.
- What?

454
00:33:57,663 --> 00:33:59,665
What's going on?

455
00:33:59,748 --> 00:34:04,211
Edgar's soldiers rounding up elfin singers
to perform at the coronation.

456
00:34:04,294 --> 00:34:07,589
Get in. And you.

457
00:34:09,633 --> 00:34:12,511
Slannen, you've gotta go to Lamia
and petition the prince.

458
00:34:12,594 --> 00:34:15,514
- For what?
- To go to law school. You gotta stop this.

459
00:34:19,893 --> 00:34:22,855
You want me to go
to Lamia on my own?

460
00:34:22,896 --> 00:34:25,858
We're going to Giantville.
It's on the way. Come with us.

461
00:34:25,899 --> 00:34:29,695
The prince will never grant an audience
with an elf. They think we're a joke.

462
00:34:29,778 --> 00:34:35,242
I have met Prince Charmont, and I think
he might be different than his uncle.

463
00:34:35,325 --> 00:34:39,079
- Why? Cos he's a hunk?
- No.

464
00:34:39,163 --> 00:34:41,206
- What is he, about six foot?
- About.

465
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:44,877
Yeah, I hate the guy already.
I'm not wasting my time.

466
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,172
Lacking courage as well as height.

467
00:34:52,176 --> 00:34:55,846
Count me in.
Elves aren't that short, you know.

468
00:34:56,430 --> 00:35:00,100
That's just a myth created by that stupid
"Elves and the Shoemaker" story.

469
00:35:00,184 --> 00:35:03,020
- Do I look small enough to fit in a shoe?
- No.

470
00:35:03,061 --> 00:35:06,523
Stinking Grimm Brothers.
Are you sure he knows where he's going?

471
00:35:06,565 --> 00:35:09,902
Hey, I'm right here. Just cos I'm a book
doesn't mean I don't have ears.

472
00:35:09,943 --> 00:35:14,281
Boys, if you can't play nice,
you can't play together.

473
00:35:16,492 --> 00:35:21,538
Oh, no. The rustling always comes
before the screaming and the running.

474
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,415
I knew this was gonna happen.

475
00:35:23,499 --> 00:35:27,920
They'll just find pieces of us
scattered across the forest floor.

476
00:35:28,003 --> 00:35:34,009
Oh, a bunny. You know, the last known
case of a bunny attack was, well, never.

477
00:35:35,511 --> 00:35:38,514
It never hurts to be on your guard.

478
00:35:41,099 --> 00:35:44,353
Nobody panic, nobody panic.
I've got this in hand.

479
00:35:44,436 --> 00:35:45,562
Oi!

480
00:35:45,604 --> 00:35:47,940
You! Thumper!

481
00:35:48,023 --> 00:35:51,318
Out of the forest or no more carrots for you.

482
00:35:54,446 --> 00:35:57,157
I don't like carrots.

483
00:35:58,283 --> 00:36:01,870
How do you feel about rabbits,
cos one just went thataway.

484
00:36:01,954 --> 00:36:05,082
I am the ogre, Nish.

485
00:36:05,165 --> 00:36:10,629
How do you like to be eaten?
Baked, boiled, shish-kebabbed?

486
00:36:10,712 --> 00:36:13,298
How about free range?

487
00:36:15,133 --> 00:36:16,969
Stop! No!

488
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:20,305
Ella of Frell. Hi, how are you doing?

489
00:36:20,389 --> 00:36:25,269
I think there's been a big mistake here.
See, I'm pro-ogre.

490
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:26,812
Pro-ogre?

491
00:36:26,895 --> 00:36:30,816
Absolutely. I led a rally on your behalf
the other day. Maybe you heard about it.

492
00:36:30,899 --> 00:36:35,696
It'll only hurt for a moment, I promise.
I'm a fast eater.

493
00:36:37,656 --> 00:36:41,118
Slannen, Slannen!
Please, I want to help.

494
00:36:41,201 --> 00:36:43,787
Help? From a human?

495
00:36:44,538 --> 00:36:47,124
Humans took everything from us.

496
00:36:47,207 --> 00:36:51,128
I was an ogre of leisure, with a simple life.

497
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:54,339
- Next thing you know...
- Now, not this again.

498
00:36:54,423 --> 00:36:58,635
Nish, hurry up. I'm starving.

499
00:36:58,677 --> 00:37:01,388
Right, you, into the pot.

500
00:37:04,183 --> 00:37:07,227
Forget that.

501
00:37:08,979 --> 00:37:11,982
- Who are you?
- I am the ogre, Nish.

502
00:37:12,941 --> 00:37:16,403
We just did this. Didn't we just do this?

503
00:37:16,487 --> 00:37:19,573
All right, that's enough fun and games.

504
00:37:19,656 --> 00:37:22,910
Now, keep your mouth shut
and don't move.

505
00:37:28,373 --> 00:37:30,209
Is it boiling yet?

506
00:37:30,292 --> 00:37:32,711
It's not gonna boil
if you stand there looking at it.

507
00:37:32,794 --> 00:37:35,631
You couldn't show a picture
of a big ogre heading our way?

508
00:37:35,714 --> 00:37:38,383
- That would have been helpful.
- Oh! Oh!

509
00:37:38,467 --> 00:37:40,761
I think I see bubbles.

510
00:37:47,768 --> 00:37:50,229
Let her go!

511
00:38:03,951 --> 00:38:06,787
Untie yourself.

512
00:38:42,281 --> 00:38:44,825
Truce! Truce!

513
00:38:44,908 --> 00:38:47,035
Can't we just get along?

514
00:38:48,495 --> 00:38:51,206
Are you one of the monsters
who killed my father?

515
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:54,918
King Florian was a good man.
We lived in peace during his reign.

516
00:38:55,002 --> 00:38:57,337
Why would we kill him?

517
00:39:02,384 --> 00:39:05,220
I'll spare your lives
where you didn't spare his.

518
00:39:05,304 --> 00:39:09,224
You take your friends
and find breakfast elsewhere.

519
00:39:09,308 --> 00:39:11,768
We'll pick up something else on the way.

520
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:16,023
Anyway, you eat maiden,
an hour later you're hungry again.

521
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:25,324
What are you doing here,
with an elf for protection?

522
00:39:25,407 --> 00:39:27,826
Do you get a kick
out of near-death experiences?

523
00:39:27,868 --> 00:39:31,330
No. I was fine. I had things well in hand.

524
00:39:31,371 --> 00:39:34,583
I could see that, as you were dangling
over the boiling cauldron,

525
00:39:34,666 --> 00:39:37,669
no doubt lulling the ogres
into a false sense of security.

526
00:39:37,753 --> 00:39:41,465
Who's to say it wouldn't have worked
if you hadn't come barging in?

527
00:39:41,548 --> 00:39:45,719
I see the score currently stands
at chivalry two, gratitude zero.

528
00:39:45,802 --> 00:39:47,804
Look...

529
00:39:49,556 --> 00:39:52,518
You're right. I'm sorry.

530
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:55,896
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

531
00:39:55,979 --> 00:39:58,232
- You're bleeding.
- Hm?

532
00:39:58,315 --> 00:40:00,317
Oh, it's just a scratch.

533
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,570
You'd better let me help you with that.

534
00:40:10,202 --> 00:40:14,456
- So, will I live?
- I think the odds are in your favor.

535
00:40:15,374 --> 00:40:18,335
So... where were you headed?

536
00:40:18,377 --> 00:40:21,797
The giants' village for a wedding.
I'm meeting my godmother.

537
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,508
That's on our way back to Lamia.
We'll accompany you.

538
00:40:24,591 --> 00:40:26,260
That's not necessary.

539
00:40:26,343 --> 00:40:31,014
It makes it so much easier rescuing you
if I don't have to commute.

540
00:40:31,098 --> 00:40:38,313
I'm so glad I was here
for this interesting development.

541
00:40:39,439 --> 00:40:43,735
- Look, I really appreciate the offer, but...
- Are you crazy? Tell him to come with us.

542
00:40:43,819 --> 00:40:45,821
Come with us.

543
00:40:54,371 --> 00:40:59,168
So, traveling with an elf?
Your boyfriend couldn't make it?

544
00:40:59,251 --> 00:41:00,961
- No.
- Oh.

545
00:41:01,044 --> 00:41:03,547
- Because I don't have one.
- Oh.

546
00:41:05,382 --> 00:41:08,093
Your girlfriend doesn't mind
being left alone?

547
00:41:08,177 --> 00:41:10,429
- I don't have a girlfriend.
- Oh?

548
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:14,266
- I have many.
- Oh.

549
00:41:16,768 --> 00:41:21,356
I'm kidding. Shouldn't believe
everything you read in "Medieval Teen".

550
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,902
Excuse me. Excuse me.

551
00:41:24,985 --> 00:41:27,863
Prince Charmont, permission to speak?

552
00:41:28,947 --> 00:41:31,867
- Sure.
- You know the word coincidence?

553
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:35,787
It just so happens I was on my way
to meet a certain royal someone

554
00:41:35,871 --> 00:41:39,958
in order to discuss some career options
currently unavailable to...

555
00:41:40,042 --> 00:41:44,505
Slannen wants to petition the kingdom
for the right to become a lawyer.

556
00:41:44,588 --> 00:41:46,423
- A lawyer?
- Why not?

557
00:41:46,465 --> 00:41:50,427
There were no laws against it
when your father was king.

558
00:41:50,511 --> 00:41:53,597
That's not really my area of expertise.

559
00:41:53,639 --> 00:41:56,850
My advice to you
would be to talk to my uncle.

560
00:41:56,934 --> 00:41:59,645
I'm sure if you make a good argument,
he'll come round.

561
00:41:59,728 --> 00:42:04,274
Well, thank you for your... advice.

562
00:42:11,657 --> 00:42:15,118
- What?
- You're about to become king.

563
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:20,541
You'll have the power to make a difference
in the world and you don't even care.

564
00:42:20,624 --> 00:42:24,962
It's not like I asked to become king.
I've had no say in the matter.

565
00:42:25,003 --> 00:42:28,882
Well, thanks to your uncle, there are a lot
of people who have no say in the matter.

566
00:42:28,966 --> 00:42:32,010
Nobody should be forced to do things
they don't wanna do.

567
00:42:32,094 --> 00:42:34,763
Take it from somebody who knows.

568
00:42:36,473 --> 00:42:39,518
Ella! Ella!

569
00:42:55,868 --> 00:42:59,872
You're not finished yet.
You work until sundown.

570
00:43:03,208 --> 00:43:07,588
The giants have always been
gentle. Why are they treated like slaves?

571
00:43:07,671 --> 00:43:10,507
I'm sure my uncle doesn't know about this.

572
00:43:10,549 --> 00:43:12,551
He couldn't.

573
00:43:22,895 --> 00:43:25,772
Maybe you can get
to the bottom of this at the wedding.

574
00:43:25,856 --> 00:43:28,734
Maybe you can find
your godmother.

575
00:43:58,805 --> 00:44:00,682
Whoa.

576
00:44:01,975 --> 00:44:06,271
They're not so bad.
I thought they'd be all so big and scary.

577
00:44:09,399 --> 00:44:10,734
Didn't hurt.

578
00:44:10,776 --> 00:44:13,779
I hope this is a good idea.
They must hate the royal family.

579
00:44:13,862 --> 00:44:16,448
They'll respect your courage
at showing up here.

580
00:44:16,532 --> 00:44:21,078
Besides, they don't hold grudges.
They're bigger than that.

581
00:44:21,161 --> 00:44:24,248
Prince Charmont.
What are you doing here?

582
00:44:24,289 --> 00:44:26,708
No grudges, eh?

583
00:44:26,792 --> 00:44:31,755
Well, I thought that maybe this would be a
good time to possibly have a heart-to-heart.

584
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:37,177
But now I'm thinking I should come back
when there's been a little less drinking.

585
00:44:37,261 --> 00:44:41,265
He's here as a friend
to hear your complaints.

586
00:44:41,306 --> 00:44:43,684
Then welcome.

587
00:44:43,767 --> 00:44:47,271
I'm looking for someone.
My godmother, Lucinda.

588
00:44:47,312 --> 00:44:49,314
She was over there earlier.

589
00:44:53,819 --> 00:44:56,780
Thank you. I'll be right back.

590
00:45:02,995 --> 00:45:06,748
Excuse me. Is Lucinda Perriweather here?

591
00:45:06,832 --> 00:45:11,044
Too late, sweetheart.
She left about an hour ago.

592
00:45:11,128 --> 00:45:13,797
Do you know where I can find her?

593
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:17,301
Last I heard,
she was somewhere living in Lamia.

594
00:45:17,384 --> 00:45:20,095
Do you know where the bathroom is?

595
00:45:22,681 --> 00:45:25,350
Benny, show me Lucinda.

596
00:45:26,351 --> 00:45:28,687
Looks like she's getting an FWl.

597
00:45:28,729 --> 00:45:32,524
- FWl?
- Flying while intoxicated.

598
00:45:34,359 --> 00:45:36,695
- She could be anywhere.
- Ow!

599
00:45:36,778 --> 00:45:39,198
Sorry.

600
00:45:47,456 --> 00:45:49,458
Agh!

601
00:45:54,713 --> 00:45:56,340
Ooh.

602
00:45:56,423 --> 00:45:59,009
I'd no idea things were so bad.

603
00:45:59,051 --> 00:46:02,763
I promise, first thing after my coronation,
I'll help you buy your farms back.

604
00:46:02,846 --> 00:46:04,932
I'll hold you to that.

605
00:46:05,015 --> 00:46:07,518
- I'm sorry to interrupt.
- No problem. We were done.

606
00:46:07,601 --> 00:46:10,103
That's a fine young man you have here.

607
00:46:10,562 --> 00:46:14,274
He's not fine. I mean, mine. He is fine...

608
00:46:16,109 --> 00:46:17,694
Never mind.

609
00:46:17,736 --> 00:46:20,656
So have you seen Slannen?
We have to leave.

610
00:46:20,739 --> 00:46:23,867
My godmother's on some kind of bender.

611
00:46:23,909 --> 00:46:26,328
You can't leave now.
It's the middle of the night.

612
00:46:26,411 --> 00:46:29,748
You have to stay for the party.

613
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:32,125
OK, I'll stay.

614
00:46:33,418 --> 00:46:37,631
I appreciate your enthusiasm,
but you don't have to stay.

615
00:46:37,714 --> 00:46:41,927
I don't wanna make you do
anything you don't wanna do.

616
00:46:42,928 --> 00:46:46,265
Thank you, Char. For everything.

617
00:46:46,348 --> 00:46:48,350
So I'll see you around?

618
00:46:53,814 --> 00:46:56,316
But I wish you would stay.

619
00:47:00,529 --> 00:47:03,532
I guess one more night wouldn't hurt.

620
00:47:04,783 --> 00:47:07,911
Mmm. Yuck.

621
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:13,959
So you're looking
for your godmother Lucinda?

622
00:47:14,042 --> 00:47:18,088
She was supposed to be here,
and now I have no idea where she is,

623
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:21,967
and I need to find her
as soon as possible bec...

624
00:47:22,926 --> 00:47:25,888
Because I miss her.

625
00:47:26,972 --> 00:47:28,932
OK.

626
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:32,769
- Did you think of trying the hall of records?
- No.

627
00:47:32,853 --> 00:47:36,356
We have every year's census in the castle.

628
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:41,195
It's not open to everyone,
but I could probably pull a few strings.

629
00:47:41,278 --> 00:47:44,448
Char, I can't tell you
what that would mean to me.

630
00:47:44,531 --> 00:47:48,035
Well, then, it's settled.
You come with me to Lamia tomorrow.

631
00:47:48,118 --> 00:47:49,786
OK.

632
00:47:51,163 --> 00:47:52,998
- I gotta hide. They're after me.
- Who?

633
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:56,001
The giants.
They want me to sing. I don't sing!

634
00:47:56,043 --> 00:48:00,214
There he is. There's our little entertainer.

635
00:48:01,590 --> 00:48:07,846
Mr Koopooduk, I know you may find this
hard to believe, but Slannen doesn't sing.

636
00:48:07,888 --> 00:48:11,892
- Well, how about you, then?
- Me? Oh, no. I couldn't.

637
00:48:11,975 --> 00:48:15,229
- Now, come on.
- Please don't.

638
00:48:15,312 --> 00:48:17,481
Sing.

639
00:49:18,125 --> 00:49:20,752
Louder!

640
00:49:53,452 --> 00:49:55,787
Give it a little more soul!

641
00:50:21,313 --> 00:50:23,315
Dance!

642
00:51:55,699 --> 00:51:57,743
I love singers.

643
00:51:57,826 --> 00:52:00,037
Really?

644
00:52:00,078 --> 00:52:04,917
Because, you know,
being an elf, I love to sing.

645
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,753
You know, I hope
you don't mind me saying this,

646
00:52:07,836 --> 00:52:12,841
but you're much prettier
than I would have expected.

647
00:52:12,925 --> 00:52:17,387
Oh, I know. Giants are supposed
to be big, ugly and mean.

648
00:52:17,429 --> 00:52:20,724
It's because of stories
like "Jack and the Beanstalk".

649
00:52:20,766 --> 00:52:23,268
Stinking Grimm Brothers.

650
00:52:26,271 --> 00:52:29,149
I've seen weirder couples.

651
00:52:29,233 --> 00:52:33,320
None that immediately come to mind,
but still.

652
00:52:33,403 --> 00:52:37,241
My stepsister Hattie would die
if she knew I was here.

653
00:52:37,282 --> 00:52:39,660
She's the president
of your fan club, you know.

654
00:52:39,743 --> 00:52:42,913
Oh, Hattie, yes. Thank you.

655
00:52:42,996 --> 00:52:47,709
Now I know what name
to put on the restraining order.

656
00:52:47,793 --> 00:52:52,047
No, you're lucky.
I wish I had brothers and sisters.

657
00:52:52,965 --> 00:52:56,218
My mother passed away
before she had any more children and...

658
00:52:56,301 --> 00:52:58,762
My mother passed away, too.

659
00:53:01,223 --> 00:53:03,225
Oh.

660
00:53:03,976 --> 00:53:07,771
You know, she used to sing me
to sleep every night.

661
00:53:07,813 --> 00:53:13,777
My father used to sing to me,
loudly and very off-key, but...

662
00:53:13,819 --> 00:53:15,821
I still miss him.

663
00:53:15,904 --> 00:53:18,031
I have Edgar, I guess.

664
00:53:18,115 --> 00:53:22,244
He's not such a bad guy.
He risked his life to save my father.

665
00:53:22,327 --> 00:53:25,455
And he brought me up as his own son.

666
00:53:25,539 --> 00:53:27,833
I know you don't like his politics much,

667
00:53:27,875 --> 00:53:32,921
but I'm sure when I tell him about
the giants, he will correct the situation.

668
00:53:33,005 --> 00:53:35,757
Yeah, or you could.

669
00:53:35,841 --> 00:53:40,345
It took a lot of guts for you to come here.
Look at the way you smoothed things over.

670
00:53:40,429 --> 00:53:42,764
You're a natural at this.

671
00:53:44,016 --> 00:53:46,852
Wow, is that almost a compliment?

672
00:53:48,145 --> 00:53:53,609
Almost. Now, don't go getting a big head.
Your crown won't fit.

673
00:53:53,692 --> 00:53:56,695
You know what else?
Tomorrow I'm gonna go to my uncle

674
00:53:56,778 --> 00:53:59,823
and I'm gonna ask him
to repeal the elfin restrictions.

675
00:53:59,865 --> 00:54:04,703
Slannen will have his day in court,
if I have anything to say about it.

676
00:54:14,671 --> 00:54:18,842
I think you're gonna be
a great king someday.

677
00:54:18,926 --> 00:54:21,512
Your father would have been proud.

678
00:54:23,096 --> 00:54:25,432
Thanks.

679
00:54:28,685 --> 00:54:31,897
I think he would have really liked you.

680
00:54:39,571 --> 00:54:41,907
Kiss me.

681
00:54:48,330 --> 00:54:51,458
That wasn't an order, you know.

682
00:54:54,878 --> 00:54:57,214
I know.

683
00:55:34,126 --> 00:55:38,338
I want to look 25 at tonight's ball.
What do you suggest?

684
00:55:38,422 --> 00:55:40,424
A time machine?

685
00:55:40,507 --> 00:55:43,594
May I recommend our newest procedure?

686
00:55:44,553 --> 00:55:47,764
Bat faeces and oxen blood.

687
00:55:48,974 --> 00:55:50,976
Batox.

688
00:55:52,102 --> 00:55:55,272
Works wonders, although I do caution you,

689
00:55:55,314 --> 00:55:57,941
some people have
a temporarily bad reaction.

690
00:55:58,025 --> 00:56:01,487
- Olga.
- Peter, what are you doing here?

691
00:56:01,528 --> 00:56:05,782
I'm in town on business and heard
you were here. I came to see Ella.

692
00:56:05,824 --> 00:56:08,827
- Is Ella here?
- Of course. Where else would she be?

693
00:56:08,869 --> 00:56:14,458
She's... she's... with Hattie and Olive,
taking a tour of the castle.

694
00:56:20,005 --> 00:56:23,342
Next we move into the castle lobby.

695
00:56:23,383 --> 00:56:25,552
I can't believe it.

696
00:56:25,636 --> 00:56:29,014
Prince Char walked on this actual floor!

697
00:56:30,015 --> 00:56:32,976
Ladies, ladies, ladies!

698
00:56:33,018 --> 00:56:35,020
Stop tonguing the foyer.

699
00:56:37,189 --> 00:56:40,818
Show us where Char showers.

700
00:56:40,901 --> 00:56:43,862
I bet he showers naked!

701
00:56:54,790 --> 00:56:58,043
- Hold it, pipsqueak.
- I'm with the prince. And I'm not that short.

702
00:56:58,126 --> 00:57:00,921
- Are you singing at the coronation?
- Heck, no.

703
00:57:01,004 --> 00:57:03,757
No elves in the palace
unless they're performing.

704
00:57:03,841 --> 00:57:06,343
Discrimination. Intentional infliction of...

705
00:57:06,385 --> 00:57:08,470
Whoa!

706
00:57:11,056 --> 00:57:13,058
..bodily harm.

707
00:57:13,141 --> 00:57:16,895
These portraits
were recently commissioned

708
00:57:16,979 --> 00:57:20,607
in honor of tomorrow's coronation.

709
00:57:30,576 --> 00:57:33,370
Right, follow me.

710
00:57:33,453 --> 00:57:35,455
What are they doing here?

711
00:57:35,539 --> 00:57:39,543
I don't mean to rush, but now I really need
to find my godmother, and Slannen, too.

712
00:57:39,585 --> 00:57:42,880
- Where is he?
- My uncle'll send the guards to find him.

713
00:57:42,921 --> 00:57:47,134
Everything's gonna be fine.
Don't forget, you are with the future king.

714
00:57:47,217 --> 00:57:49,887
- Char.
- Hello, Uncle.

715
00:57:51,096 --> 00:57:53,432
I've been looking all over for you.

716
00:57:53,473 --> 00:57:57,478
And who might
this charming young lady be?

717
00:57:57,561 --> 00:58:01,565
This is Ella. Ella of Frell.

718
00:58:01,648 --> 00:58:03,859
Ella, this is my Uncle Edgar.

719
00:58:04,776 --> 00:58:09,448
And this is his... Heston.

720
00:58:09,865 --> 00:58:11,867
Hey.

721
00:58:12,868 --> 00:58:16,205
So, I trust your journey was pleasant?

722
00:58:16,288 --> 00:58:19,875
We had a little run-in with some ogres,
but Char got the best of them.

723
00:58:19,958 --> 00:58:22,503
You could have been killed.

724
00:58:22,586 --> 00:58:28,217
Ah, well. One just has to grin and bear it,
I always say. Grin and bear it.

725
00:58:30,969 --> 00:58:34,389
So, Char, might I trouble you
for a moment?

726
00:58:34,473 --> 00:58:38,143
The crown maker needs to see you
in your chambers for a fitting.

727
00:58:38,227 --> 00:58:44,358
Sure. I just have to take Ella to the...
to the hall of records.

728
00:58:45,150 --> 00:58:48,529
Yes, well, hop to it, then, both of you.

729
00:58:57,788 --> 00:59:01,750
You were right about that girl. Very odd.

730
00:59:01,834 --> 00:59:04,878
And I'm afraid she's been
filling our prince's head

731
00:59:04,962 --> 00:59:08,215
with dangerous new thoughts.

732
00:59:09,675 --> 00:59:14,721
Here's the latest census. Names are listed
first by location then species.

733
00:59:14,805 --> 00:59:16,682
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

734
00:59:16,723 --> 00:59:19,893
Sorry I couldn't be of more help,
but I don't have a census.

735
00:59:19,977 --> 00:59:24,606
I mean, look at the size of that thing.
I do have a restaurant guide.

736
00:59:24,690 --> 00:59:27,526
Lucinda, I hope you're in here.

737
00:59:37,327 --> 00:59:42,082
Ella has lots of interesting opinions about
the kingdom, Uncle. You should hear them.

738
00:59:42,166 --> 00:59:44,001
I can't wait.

739
00:59:44,042 --> 00:59:48,380
The giants' working conditions,
for instance. They're unbelievable.

740
00:59:48,463 --> 00:59:52,176
Luckily, I've talked to them
and they're definitely open for negotiation.

741
00:59:52,259 --> 00:59:58,265
The only negotiations between me and the
giants will be over our vegetable deliveries.

742
00:59:59,850 --> 01:00:01,727
Good one, sire.

743
01:00:01,768 --> 01:00:04,605
This isn't a joke, Uncle Edgar.

744
01:00:11,487 --> 01:00:14,072
We'll talk about it
after your coronation, yes?

745
01:00:14,156 --> 01:00:18,076
Fine, but we will talk.

746
01:00:18,118 --> 01:00:20,454
Of course.

747
01:00:23,707 --> 01:00:26,418
I... I'm going to ask her to marry me.

748
01:00:30,631 --> 01:00:35,928
Who? This... this Ella of Frell?

749
01:00:36,011 --> 01:00:40,015
Yes. Tonight, at the ball.

750
01:00:40,098 --> 01:00:43,936
At the same time and in the same place
as my father proposed to my mother.

751
01:00:43,977 --> 01:00:48,357
- Get off! Do you know who I am?
- Come with me.

752
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:53,278
- What now?
- Get off! Get off me!

753
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:57,783
So, Ella of Frell is your sister.

754
01:00:57,825 --> 01:01:00,828
- Stepsister, actually.
- Really?

755
01:01:02,454 --> 01:01:05,666
T ell me, what do you know about her?

756
01:01:05,749 --> 01:01:07,584
What's in it for me?

757
01:01:07,626 --> 01:01:13,048
How about that your eyeballs
remain inside your head?

758
01:01:16,593 --> 01:01:19,096
Now, now, Heston.

759
01:01:19,179 --> 01:01:23,559
We like these girls. They're our friends.

760
01:01:26,603 --> 01:01:29,439
I can't find anything in any of these books.

761
01:01:29,481 --> 01:01:31,817
Benny, show me Lucinda.

762
01:01:32,776 --> 01:01:35,070
No, still sacked out.

763
01:01:37,447 --> 01:01:39,950
I don't know where else to...

764
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:48,125
Dun Flyin Retirement Community
for Faeries?

765
01:01:49,376 --> 01:01:52,379
Why don't we just cut to the chase, hm?

766
01:01:53,630 --> 01:01:59,136
I might even be willing
to throw Prince Char into the deal.

767
01:01:59,219 --> 01:02:04,266
Let's see, now. After the coronation
he'll need to take a queen,

768
01:02:04,349 --> 01:02:09,521
and shall we say... his hand in marriage?

769
01:02:10,856 --> 01:02:13,484
Queen Olive.

770
01:02:14,943 --> 01:02:17,404
For the eldest daughter, of course.

771
01:02:20,407 --> 01:02:23,118
Ella does everything she's told.

772
01:02:23,202 --> 01:02:28,123
I don't know why, but she does.
She can't help it.

773
01:02:30,709 --> 01:02:32,044
Lucinda Perriweather,

774
01:02:32,085 --> 01:02:35,506
Dun Flyin Retirement Community
for Faeries, Lamia Heights.

775
01:02:35,547 --> 01:02:38,091
Benny! Benny, we got her.

776
01:02:38,175 --> 01:02:40,302
Hello, Ella.

777
01:02:43,514 --> 01:02:47,726
I hope you've found everything
to your satisfaction?

778
01:02:47,810 --> 01:02:51,605
- Yes, thank you.
- Good, good.

779
01:02:53,398 --> 01:02:57,236
Oh, dear. How clumsy of me. Pick it up.

780
01:03:00,322 --> 01:03:02,908
Very good.

781
01:03:02,991 --> 01:03:06,078
Now touch your toes.

782
01:03:06,161 --> 01:03:07,371
Oh, no.

783
01:03:07,454 --> 01:03:10,165
Oh, yes. And while you're about it,

784
01:03:10,249 --> 01:03:15,671
why don't you pat your head
and rub your tummy at the same time?

785
01:03:16,713 --> 01:03:19,216
Now jump up and down.

786
01:03:22,427 --> 01:03:25,347
- Please stop.
- Wait.

787
01:03:25,430 --> 01:03:28,100
Perhaps you know this one.

788
01:03:43,574 --> 01:03:45,576
This is fabulous!

789
01:03:45,617 --> 01:03:51,290
Hate to be a party pooper,
but, Edgar, evil plans, remember?

790
01:03:51,373 --> 01:03:53,876
Yes, you're right. OK, stop.

791
01:03:59,631 --> 01:04:05,596
As you know, tonight is the coronation ball.

792
01:04:07,139 --> 01:04:09,099
At some point,

793
01:04:09,183 --> 01:04:14,771
amidst your frolicking and romancing,

794
01:04:16,106 --> 01:04:21,445
Prince Char will sweep you away
to the hall of mirrors.

795
01:04:23,864 --> 01:04:28,035
Then, just before midnight,

796
01:04:28,118 --> 01:04:33,123
he will take you by the hand
and ask you a question.

797
01:04:35,083 --> 01:04:37,044
How do you know all this?

798
01:04:37,127 --> 01:04:40,130
We know everything, my dear.

799
01:04:40,214 --> 01:04:45,010
And the one thing we know
with most certainty

800
01:04:45,093 --> 01:04:50,349
is that at the stroke of midnight
you will take this dagger

801
01:04:50,432 --> 01:04:54,770
and plunge it
through his heart and kill him.

802
01:04:54,853 --> 01:04:56,814
No! No, I won't!

803
01:04:56,897 --> 01:04:59,399
Oh, yes, you will.

804
01:04:59,483 --> 01:05:03,028
You will, because I order you to.

805
01:05:11,078 --> 01:05:16,750
Actually, it's lucky you're here,
so I won't have to do it myself.

806
01:05:17,876 --> 01:05:20,504
You'd kill your own nephew?

807
01:05:20,587 --> 01:05:23,882
Why not? I killed my own brother.

808
01:05:23,966 --> 01:05:27,177
What? Why?

809
01:05:27,261 --> 01:05:30,931
- I want to be king.
- Duh!

810
01:05:31,014 --> 01:05:33,016
Now go.

811
01:05:35,102 --> 01:05:37,271
Wait.

812
01:05:37,354 --> 01:05:40,440
There's one more thing.

813
01:05:40,524 --> 01:05:44,570
You will tell no one of this plan.

814
01:05:56,123 --> 01:05:58,876
- Can I help you?
- I'm looking for Lucinda Perriweather.

815
01:05:58,959 --> 01:06:02,212
- It's kind of urgent.
- Sorry. She was kicked out last week.

816
01:06:02,254 --> 01:06:05,048
- Do you know where I could find her?
- Nope.

817
01:06:05,132 --> 01:06:10,012
You don't understand. If I don't find her,
something terrible's going to happen.

818
01:06:10,095 --> 01:06:13,432
Finding her would be something terrible.

819
01:06:19,354 --> 01:06:21,773
<i>Dear Char.</i>

820
01:06:21,815 --> 01:06:26,820
<i>This is the hardest thing I've ever
had to do, and I hope you'll understand.</i>

821
01:06:26,904 --> 01:06:29,948
<i>We can't be together.</i>

822
01:06:30,032 --> 01:06:32,826
<i>I can't tell you why.</i>

823
01:06:32,910 --> 01:06:36,580
<i>Please believe
that this is the only solution.</i>

824
01:06:36,622 --> 01:06:39,416
<i>I wish you the best.</i>

825
01:06:39,458 --> 01:06:43,086
<i>I really do believe
you're going to be a great king.</i>

826
01:06:43,170 --> 01:06:45,923
<i>Goodbye for ever. Ella.</i>

827
01:06:54,640 --> 01:07:00,771
<i>Now, if she stayed clear
of the prince until midnight had passed,</i>

828
01:07:00,813 --> 01:07:03,774
<i>then Char would be safe.</i>

829
01:07:03,816 --> 01:07:06,819
<i>But how long could that last?</i>

830
01:07:08,445 --> 01:07:11,323
Slannen, where have you been?

831
01:07:11,365 --> 01:07:13,575
What are you doing? Never mind.

832
01:07:13,659 --> 01:07:16,912
This may sound strange,
but there's something I need you to do.

833
01:07:20,791 --> 01:07:22,793
You are one freaky chick.

834
01:07:22,835 --> 01:07:27,047
I need you to go back into the forest and
rally all the elves and giants you can find.

835
01:07:27,130 --> 01:07:30,634
- You want me to go back in there?
- You'll need all the help you can get.

836
01:07:30,717 --> 01:07:34,471
Someone has to get into the castle, find
Benny and keep Char away from Edgar.

837
01:07:34,555 --> 01:07:38,142
- Why? What's going on?
- I already told you, I can't tell you.

838
01:07:38,225 --> 01:07:40,269
But if you don't,

839
01:07:40,352 --> 01:07:43,814
you might very well be stuck
singing "Kumbaya" the rest of your life.

840
01:07:43,897 --> 01:07:48,110
Fine! Into the forest of certain death
walks Slannen.

841
01:07:49,444 --> 01:07:52,072
- Thank you.
- Yeah, whatever.

842
01:08:25,105 --> 01:08:27,649
Where's your little friend?

843
01:08:27,733 --> 01:08:30,903
Yes. She should be here by now.

844
01:08:30,986 --> 01:08:33,655
I don't want to talk about her.

845
01:08:38,744 --> 01:08:41,163
Agh! Oh!

846
01:08:41,246 --> 01:08:43,499
Oh! Oh!

847
01:08:44,124 --> 01:08:46,460
Slannen, please hurry.

848
01:08:51,256 --> 01:08:53,509
Would you stop that?

849
01:08:53,592 --> 01:08:58,555
When you steal from here,
you are stealing from me now.

850
01:08:58,597 --> 01:09:03,352
- What do you mean?
- This is my future home, isn't it?

851
01:09:03,435 --> 01:09:05,979
Oh.

852
01:09:06,063 --> 01:09:09,566
Hi. I was just polishing...

853
01:09:11,610 --> 01:09:14,071
Would you... would you care to dance?

854
01:09:14,154 --> 01:09:18,158
Are you kidding?
That's all she ever talks about.

855
01:09:22,412 --> 01:09:24,748
You wanted to look younger.

856
01:09:24,790 --> 01:09:28,001
If you spent less time on your face
and more on your maternal duties,

857
01:09:28,085 --> 01:09:30,337
we'd know where Ella was right now.

858
01:09:43,851 --> 01:09:45,310
Ouch!

859
01:09:45,394 --> 01:09:47,396
Whoa!

860
01:09:48,564 --> 01:09:51,275
What the...?
This isn't the salad bar at Brelly's.

861
01:09:51,358 --> 01:09:54,194
Lucinda. Lucinda! Lucinda!

862
01:09:57,364 --> 01:10:01,326
Oh, my goodness. Do I know you, child?

863
01:10:01,410 --> 01:10:03,954
Ella of Frell. You gave me a gift.

864
01:10:03,996 --> 01:10:07,457
Oh, yes. I remember you.

865
01:10:07,499 --> 01:10:10,460
- The obedient one.
- I am so happy to see you.

866
01:10:10,502 --> 01:10:13,130
I have been looking everywhere for you.

867
01:10:13,172 --> 01:10:18,010
- I need you to take the gift back.
- Take it back? I don't think so.

868
01:10:18,093 --> 01:10:22,598
It's not that I'm not grateful for the gift.
I am, really.

869
01:10:22,681 --> 01:10:24,766
But because of the gift,

870
01:10:24,850 --> 01:10:30,189
I'm about to do something horrible
to this guy I really like and might even love.

871
01:10:30,230 --> 01:10:34,401
Girl, you out of your mind.
Everybody loves my gifts.

872
01:10:34,485 --> 01:10:38,155
Lucinda! Lucinda, I am begging you.

873
01:10:38,238 --> 01:10:41,867
I will do anything you ask.
Please take it back.

874
01:10:41,950 --> 01:10:44,536
You don't like my gift? Fine.

875
01:10:44,620 --> 01:10:47,873
Get rid of it yourself.
Don't blame me for your problems.

876
01:10:47,956 --> 01:10:51,376
- Did I chain your butt up to this tree, huh?
- Well...

877
01:10:51,418 --> 01:10:54,254
- Huh?
- But you...

878
01:10:54,338 --> 01:10:56,006
No.

879
01:10:56,757 --> 01:11:02,888
And, in fact, just to prove
what a gem I am... I'll unchain you.

880
01:11:02,971 --> 01:11:05,182
What? No! No!

881
01:11:07,684 --> 01:11:09,853
Aren't I fabulous?

882
01:11:09,937 --> 01:11:13,106
Now, look at you. A pretty girl like you
should be at the ball.

883
01:11:13,190 --> 01:11:16,360
- What?
- Go get down with the prince.

884
01:11:16,401 --> 01:11:20,113
- No, I can't go!
- Well, not dressed like that.

885
01:11:26,453 --> 01:11:30,165
Now, that's what I'm talking about.

886
01:11:30,249 --> 01:11:32,459
OK, that hurt.

887
01:11:32,543 --> 01:11:35,212
Give, give, give.

888
01:11:35,254 --> 01:11:37,381
You're welcome.

889
01:11:37,422 --> 01:11:39,550
Tell me about your sister.

890
01:11:39,633 --> 01:11:42,094
Olive? Idiot.

891
01:11:42,177 --> 01:11:44,513
- No, Ella.
- Oh.

892
01:11:46,098 --> 01:11:51,353
I don't wanna talk about her.
She's so dreary.

893
01:11:51,436 --> 01:11:54,815
- I just wanna talk about us.
- Us?

894
01:11:54,898 --> 01:11:59,027
It sounds even more wonderful
when you say it.

895
01:12:05,450 --> 01:12:07,619
Ow!

896
01:12:16,670 --> 01:12:21,175
Something tells me
she just couldn't stay away.

897
01:12:22,801 --> 01:12:24,803
- We need to talk.
- Char, please...

898
01:12:24,887 --> 01:12:28,223
Please tell me
you never wanna see me again.

899
01:12:29,224 --> 01:12:32,603
I will if you tell me that you don't love me.

900
01:12:32,644 --> 01:12:36,523
- It's not that.
- Then why did you write me that letter?

901
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:39,610
Tell me how you really feel about me.

902
01:12:42,112 --> 01:12:47,326
I love you. But I am wrong for you, Char.
I am wrong for the kingdom.

903
01:12:47,409 --> 01:12:51,371
Is that what this is about?
Ella, that's crazy.

904
01:12:52,831 --> 01:12:54,791
Come with me.

905
01:13:17,523 --> 01:13:19,817
The hall of mirrors?

906
01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:25,989
When I was little,
my father brought me in here.

907
01:13:26,073 --> 01:13:31,078
He told me to look in the mirror
and see myself as a great leader.

908
01:13:33,247 --> 01:13:35,999
Somehow, I never could.

909
01:13:36,083 --> 01:13:39,002
And then you come along.

910
01:13:39,044 --> 01:13:41,380
Ella, what's wrong?

911
01:13:42,881 --> 01:13:46,051
I wish I could tell you.
I wish I could tell you everything.

912
01:13:46,134 --> 01:13:49,054
These last few days have been so perfect.

913
01:13:49,138 --> 01:13:53,350
Well, except for the bit
where we almost got eaten by ogres.

914
01:13:53,392 --> 01:13:57,688
And you wrote me a letter
that ripped my heart out.

915
01:13:57,729 --> 01:14:00,399
And I had to dance with Hattie.

916
01:14:00,482 --> 01:14:04,153
But none of these things matter.

917
01:14:04,236 --> 01:14:06,446
We're together now.

918
01:14:06,530 --> 01:14:09,449
And when we're together, it's like magic.

919
01:14:13,078 --> 01:14:17,040
- I never want it to end.
- I know, I know.

920
01:14:17,082 --> 01:14:20,002
- And I feel the same, but...
- That's why I brought you here.

921
01:14:20,085 --> 01:14:24,464
- Char, please listen to me.
- Ella, I know. You're scared.

922
01:14:24,548 --> 01:14:27,718
I'm scared, too.

923
01:14:27,801 --> 01:14:30,679
This is... this is a big step.

924
01:14:37,853 --> 01:14:39,813
Ella...

925
01:14:39,897 --> 01:14:44,151
Ella of Frell, will you marry me?

926
01:14:47,613 --> 01:14:50,157
No, no, no, no, no!

927
01:14:50,741 --> 01:14:53,535
- No?
- No.

928
01:14:53,619 --> 01:14:56,497
I don't understand. What is it?

929
01:14:56,580 --> 01:14:59,249
My politics? Your family?

930
01:14:59,333 --> 01:15:04,421
Because those things aren't important.
What's important is what's in our hearts.

931
01:15:04,463 --> 01:15:07,257
If our love is strong,
we can conquer anything.

932
01:15:07,341 --> 01:15:09,843
I do love you, Char.

933
01:15:15,641 --> 01:15:19,937
<i>- Ella, come here.
- Don't argue. Just do it.</i>

934
01:15:20,020 --> 01:15:22,231
<i>- Take that.
- Keep your mouth shut.</i>

935
01:15:22,314 --> 01:15:24,358
<i>- Take those.
- Don't move.</i>

936
01:15:24,441 --> 01:15:28,445
<i>On the stroke of midnight
you will take this dagger</i>

937
01:15:28,487 --> 01:15:32,115
<i>and plunge it through his heart
and kill him.</i>

938
01:15:32,199 --> 01:15:37,955
<i>What's inside you
is stronger than any spell.</i>

939
01:15:41,208 --> 01:15:44,169
You will no longer be obedient.

940
01:15:44,253 --> 01:15:47,256
You will no longer be obedient!

941
01:15:57,182 --> 01:16:01,395
I'm free. I can't believe it. I'm free.

942
01:16:02,354 --> 01:16:04,648
You tried to kill me.

943
01:16:04,731 --> 01:16:06,692
Guards!

944
01:16:06,733 --> 01:16:08,735
- No, Char...
- Take her away.

945
01:16:08,819 --> 01:16:11,822
No, Char, please.
Please, Char, wait. No, Char!

946
01:16:11,905 --> 01:16:16,660
Char, please, wait.
I can explain! Please listen to me! Char!

947
01:16:17,369 --> 01:16:19,163
No, please. No! No!

948
01:16:19,204 --> 01:16:21,498
There's been a huge mistake.

949
01:16:22,583 --> 01:16:24,376
Please.

950
01:16:24,459 --> 01:16:26,879
Just listen. Please!

951
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:35,220
<i>You realize, of course,
she'll have to be put to death immediately.</i>

952
01:16:35,304 --> 01:16:39,224
I just don't understand.
Maybe I should go and talk to her.

953
01:16:39,308 --> 01:16:42,102
No. No, I forbid you to go down there.

954
01:16:42,186 --> 01:16:45,772
Your Highness,
your uncle didn't want to frighten you,

955
01:16:45,856 --> 01:16:49,735
but the secret police informed us
of a possible uprising.

956
01:16:49,776 --> 01:16:53,989
Those ogres in the forest,
they were after you.

957
01:16:54,907 --> 01:16:58,035
The girl was obviously part of the scheme.

958
01:16:58,076 --> 01:17:01,788
The ogres never planned to hurt her.

959
01:17:01,872 --> 01:17:05,209
She was just toying
with your emotions, Char,

960
01:17:05,250 --> 01:17:09,713
so she could get close to you
and commit the murder herself.

961
01:17:09,796 --> 01:17:12,424
I... I just don't believe it.

962
01:17:12,508 --> 01:17:15,844
Yes. Yes, it does seem quite fantastic.

963
01:17:19,223 --> 01:17:22,309
You let me worry about all this, hm?

964
01:17:22,392 --> 01:17:27,022
You just concentrate
on tomorrow's coronation.

965
01:17:28,941 --> 01:17:34,571
Sire, you know I've been working
with the Red Guard.

966
01:17:34,655 --> 01:17:40,160
Why not call them in now and take over
the whole kingdom like we planned?

967
01:17:40,244 --> 01:17:44,748
First we must find a way
to get rid of the prince.

968
01:17:44,790 --> 01:17:50,128
And I think I have
a pretty good idea how to do it.

969
01:18:03,684 --> 01:18:09,148
All right. We just have to find a way
to get past those guards.

970
01:18:09,189 --> 01:18:12,651
Help! Please,
somebody get me out of here!

971
01:18:12,734 --> 01:18:15,571
Benny? What's he doing here?

972
01:18:17,364 --> 01:18:18,615
Ugh!

973
01:18:18,657 --> 01:18:21,285
- Slannen, you've saved my life.
- Are you OK?

974
01:18:21,368 --> 01:18:25,080
- I could kiss you.
- I think a nice thank-you note is enough.

975
01:18:25,164 --> 01:18:27,166
I think Ella's in trouble.

976
01:18:27,249 --> 01:18:30,210
Something to do with Edgar.
We have to find her.

977
01:18:30,294 --> 01:18:32,629
Show me Ella.

978
01:18:34,423 --> 01:18:36,717
Edgar's done this?

979
01:18:37,718 --> 01:18:43,182
We've gotta go in there and stop him.
It'll take courage, bravery...

980
01:18:45,559 --> 01:18:49,855
I was gonna ask you
how you'd like to be eaten,

981
01:18:50,397 --> 01:18:53,984
but if it's Edgar you're after... count us in.

982
01:18:56,612 --> 01:18:59,239
Welcome aboard.

983
01:19:01,408 --> 01:19:03,494
Executioner coming through.

984
01:19:03,577 --> 01:19:05,579
Enter.

985
01:19:08,749 --> 01:19:12,794
- Help.
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.

986
01:19:29,478 --> 01:19:32,397
Open up. I'm Miss Frell's
legal representation.

987
01:19:32,439 --> 01:19:35,567
- Her what?
- Her lawyer, numbskull.

988
01:19:35,651 --> 01:19:38,028
If the gauntlet doesn't fit,
you must acquit.

989
01:19:38,070 --> 01:19:41,949
Now, open this door before I sue you
for everything you own.

990
01:19:42,032 --> 01:19:44,952
Now, move it! Come on! Come on!

991
01:19:45,035 --> 01:19:51,083
Thank you. Slannen of Pim is not an elf
easily drawn into a legal battle,

992
01:19:51,166 --> 01:19:56,672
but when faced with a challenge
to equality, freedom and civil liberties,

993
01:19:56,755 --> 01:20:00,300
this elf will draw the sword of justice.

994
01:20:00,384 --> 01:20:04,888
And, furthermore...
Excuse me, what is going on here?

995
01:20:05,514 --> 01:20:09,977
- Well, can we at least take him to go?
- Put the nice man down.

996
01:20:14,273 --> 01:20:16,567
- Slannen?
- Ella?

997
01:20:17,442 --> 01:20:19,444
Ella!

998
01:20:20,737 --> 01:20:22,906
- Slannen!
- Oh, Ella!

999
01:20:22,990 --> 01:20:24,658
- Benny!
- Are you OK?

1000
01:20:24,741 --> 01:20:27,995
I'm fine, but Char might not be.
Show me Edgar.

1001
01:20:29,121 --> 01:20:32,916
- That's Char's crown.
- He's poisoned it.

1002
01:20:32,958 --> 01:20:37,171
We gotta go. Come on. Come on, guys.
We got a coronation to crash.

1003
01:20:49,683 --> 01:20:52,686
People of Lamia.

1004
01:20:52,769 --> 01:20:57,649
Today is a very special day
for our kingdom.

1005
01:20:58,484 --> 01:21:04,740
For today you are here to witness
the crowning of a king.

1006
01:21:24,551 --> 01:21:26,887
Bring in the crown.

1007
01:21:57,292 --> 01:21:59,294
Drop that crown!

1008
01:22:01,421 --> 01:22:04,091
- Ella?
- Seize them!

1009
01:22:17,813 --> 01:22:20,232
It's payback time.

1010
01:22:22,109 --> 01:22:24,403
Charge!

1011
01:22:34,204 --> 01:22:35,372
Char!

1012
01:22:35,414 --> 01:22:38,750
Kill them, and anyone
who gets in your way.

1013
01:22:41,044 --> 01:22:42,921
Oh, my God!

1014
01:22:53,098 --> 01:22:55,100
No! No, no, no, no!

1015
01:22:58,937 --> 01:23:01,648
I can't believe I'm saving you,
after you tried to kill me.

1016
01:23:01,732 --> 01:23:03,775
I didn't try to kill you.

1017
01:23:03,859 --> 01:23:06,361
You get away from her!

1018
01:23:08,947 --> 01:23:10,866
- Take this!
- Hey!

1019
01:23:11,575 --> 01:23:16,747
That dagger you were about to plunge into
my back was an early wedding present?

1020
01:23:16,788 --> 01:23:18,832
Hello! Help!

1021
01:23:19,791 --> 01:23:21,960
Mandy! Help!

1022
01:23:22,878 --> 01:23:25,380
Fairies in kingdoms across the land,

1023
01:23:25,464 --> 01:23:29,551
please help me turn Benny
back into a man.

1024
01:23:32,805 --> 01:23:34,973
A pumpkin?

1025
01:23:36,099 --> 01:23:39,978
OK, maybe I did try to kill you,
but that wasn't me.

1026
01:23:41,188 --> 01:23:44,066
- What?
- Maybe it was me, but it wasn't my fault.

1027
01:23:57,162 --> 01:24:00,833
Then Edgar found out about the curse
and he ordered me to kill you.

1028
01:24:01,458 --> 01:24:03,460
So I had to break up with you,

1029
01:24:03,544 --> 01:24:08,048
even though I'm pretty sure that you're
the best thing that's ever happened to me.

1030
01:24:08,132 --> 01:24:11,552
That crown he's about to put
on your head, it's poisoned.

1031
01:24:11,635 --> 01:24:13,762
Duck.

1032
01:24:15,013 --> 01:24:16,515
Whoa.

1033
01:24:16,598 --> 01:24:20,018
- Edgar's trying to kill me?
- Yes. Hold on.

1034
01:24:22,020 --> 01:24:23,730
How vulgar!

1035
01:24:23,814 --> 01:24:27,109
Excuse me. Thank you.

1036
01:24:30,112 --> 01:24:33,157
Char, there's one more thing.

1037
01:24:34,992 --> 01:24:37,327
He killed your father.

1038
01:24:38,453 --> 01:24:41,582
What? That can't be true.

1039
01:24:41,665 --> 01:24:43,709
Well, of course it's not true.

1040
01:24:43,792 --> 01:24:50,549
Who are you gonna believe? This lying
little twit, or the man who raised you?

1041
01:24:58,265 --> 01:25:01,393
- He tried to kill Char!
- Get him!

1042
01:25:01,477 --> 01:25:03,020
Uh-oh.

1043
01:25:04,396 --> 01:25:07,691
Well, I guess that answers that question.

1044
01:25:07,733 --> 01:25:10,110
You vile little girl.

1045
01:25:11,195 --> 01:25:14,907
I should have disposed of you
when I had the chance.

1046
01:25:17,201 --> 01:25:19,369
You almost destroyed this kingdom.

1047
01:25:19,453 --> 01:25:23,332
You killed my father, your own brother.
How could you?

1048
01:25:23,415 --> 01:25:25,792
How could l?

1049
01:25:25,876 --> 01:25:30,672
I wanted something,
he was in my way, I got rid of him.

1050
01:25:34,927 --> 01:25:40,265
He wasn't fit to wear this crown,
and you're not fit to wear this crown.

1051
01:25:40,349 --> 01:25:43,477
This crown is mine.

1052
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:46,021
This kingdom is...

1053
01:25:47,940 --> 01:25:50,275
Oops.

1054
01:25:54,905 --> 01:25:57,241
We won't be needing that.

1055
01:26:08,210 --> 01:26:10,546
You saved my life.

1056
01:26:13,298 --> 01:26:16,093
Then we're even.

1057
01:26:16,135 --> 01:26:20,180
Ella! Ella, stop kissing him!

1058
01:26:21,682 --> 01:26:24,768
You are never to kiss him again.

1059
01:26:28,981 --> 01:26:32,067
You wanna bet?

1060
01:26:41,326 --> 01:26:43,662
Marry me?

1061
01:26:44,663 --> 01:26:48,167
- Now, that I'll do.
- Ah!

1062
01:26:55,674 --> 01:26:57,676
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

1063
01:27:08,312 --> 01:27:10,355
To a nation of equals.

1064
01:27:11,148 --> 01:27:13,650
To my good friends.

1065
01:27:16,612 --> 01:27:19,448
And to my true love, Ella.

1066
01:27:38,592 --> 01:27:42,554
So, such is the story of Ella of Frell,

1067
01:27:42,596 --> 01:27:45,891
a spunky young woman
once under a spell.

1068
01:27:45,974 --> 01:27:49,269
If there's one thing to learn,
it's you just can't go wrong

1069
01:27:49,353 --> 01:27:53,232
if you follow your heart
and end with a song.

1070
01:29:53,811 --> 01:29:56,146
Good luck, Ella!

1071
01:30:03,403 --> 01:30:07,866
<i>Now it's back to the real world,
all of you I must send,</i>

1072
01:30:07,950 --> 01:30:13,372
<i>for I've only two words left,
and they are: the end.</i>
