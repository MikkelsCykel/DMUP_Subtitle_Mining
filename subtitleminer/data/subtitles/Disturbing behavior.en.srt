1
00:03:56,325 --> 00:03:58,179
What is your deal?

2
00:03:59,365 --> 00:04:01,852
I got a big game on Friday.

3
00:04:03,365 --> 00:04:06,332
Look, it's no good.
I need my fluids.

4
00:04:07,621 --> 00:04:08,995
Your fluids?

5
00:04:09,061 --> 00:04:10,435
Yeah.

6
00:04:12,965 --> 00:04:15,070
Mary Jo, I'm curious.

7
00:04:15,141 --> 00:04:17,442
Why would you do
something like that?

8
00:04:18,885 --> 00:04:20,313
Why not?

9
00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:22,112
It's self-mutilation, really.

10
00:04:27,685 --> 00:04:31,132
Self-mutilate this, fluid boy.

11
00:04:45,765 --> 00:04:47,226
Good find, girl.

12
00:04:48,165 --> 00:04:49,539
Yeah.

13
00:04:50,405 --> 00:04:51,779
Who's that?

14
00:05:01,797 --> 00:05:04,098
Oh, shit. No.

15
00:05:28,357 --> 00:05:29,731
Slut.

16
00:05:38,341 --> 00:05:39,715
Andy.

17
00:05:44,741 --> 00:05:46,912
You want to step out
for a minute?

18
00:05:48,742 --> 00:05:51,076
You kids shouldn't be out
past curfew.

19
00:05:51,141 --> 00:05:55,897
Andy Effkin,
toast with the most.

20
00:05:57,029 --> 00:06:00,028
You like our chances
against Knight's Ridge?

21
00:06:00,101 --> 00:06:01,475
We should do fine.

22
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:04,355
Thrown for a loss.

23
00:06:04,421 --> 00:06:06,243
Is your arm okay
for the game?

24
00:06:07,397 --> 00:06:09,698
- It's good.
- Offensive line up to par?

25
00:06:09,765 --> 00:06:12,634
Son of a bitch.

26
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,506
Fuck.

27
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:24,093
Easy, Eff. Easy, buddy.

28
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:28,256
- I need my fluids.
- Give me the gun.

29
00:06:31,397 --> 00:06:32,803
Get out of here, now.

30
00:06:36,838 --> 00:06:38,660
What?

31
00:06:41,286 --> 00:06:42,944
You gotta be shittin' me.

32
00:06:44,133 --> 00:06:45,507
That's Mary Jo.

33
00:06:47,717 --> 00:06:52,735
Clarice, it's Cox.
We got a wet one here on the bluff.

34
00:07:11,173 --> 00:07:14,489
I just can't wait, Steve.

35
00:07:14,565 --> 00:07:15,939
To do what?

36
00:07:16,005 --> 00:07:20,544
To see my new room,
my new school, my new everything.

37
00:07:20,613 --> 00:07:21,987
Yeah, new everything.

38
00:07:23,653 --> 00:07:26,467
It's gonna be awesome.

39
00:07:26,533 --> 00:07:28,027
It's gonna be better.

40
00:07:28,101 --> 00:07:29,475
Way better.

41
00:07:30,438 --> 00:07:31,812
Come on.

42
00:08:08,709 --> 00:08:10,334
Looks like you're moving
to Cradle Bay.

43
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:14,235
- We sure are.
- Sure you'll like it here.

44
00:08:14,309 --> 00:08:17,920
- You'll never want to leave.
- You hear that?

45
00:08:48,038 --> 00:08:51,136
Hey, you. I thought
you were gonna help me.

46
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:54,783
Come on.

47
00:08:54,854 --> 00:08:56,228
Fridge.

48
00:08:56,294 --> 00:08:57,668
Thank you.

49
00:09:05,445 --> 00:09:06,819
You all right?

50
00:09:06,886 --> 00:09:08,260
Yeah.

51
00:09:08,325 --> 00:09:12,001
Just trying to put
some of this stuff away.

52
00:09:12,069 --> 00:09:13,629
Nervous?

53
00:09:14,662 --> 00:09:16,669
- About what?
- First day at school.

54
00:09:25,702 --> 00:09:27,076
Dad?

55
00:09:41,221 --> 00:09:43,609
What are you doing, dipshit? Don't
worry about snakes in the garden...

56
00:09:43,686 --> 00:09:45,180
when you got spiders
in your bed.

57
00:10:01,158 --> 00:10:03,613
"They had been so innocent
and little there.

58
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:06,817
And all beyond was
so unknown and great."

59
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:10,337
Very good, Trent.

60
00:10:10,406 --> 00:10:12,096
To wit, when Pip says this...

61
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:14,686
Dickens is speaking
of the joy of discovery...

62
00:10:14,758 --> 00:10:18,019
of newness, of change.

63
00:10:18,086 --> 00:10:20,093
Mr. Clark,
perhaps you can relate.

64
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:24,356
Mr. Clark is new to us from Chicago.
Do they read Dickens in Chicago?

65
00:10:27,397 --> 00:10:28,771
Dickie Atkinson.

66
00:10:29,925 --> 00:10:31,615
Welcome.

67
00:10:31,686 --> 00:10:34,653
Tell us why you're late.
Trouble with the camshaft?

68
00:10:34,725 --> 00:10:36,186
Like you know what one is.

69
00:10:36,262 --> 00:10:40,036
Somebody woke up on the wrong side
of the carburetor this morning.

70
00:10:40,102 --> 00:10:41,530
Peckerhead.

71
00:10:43,942 --> 00:10:47,073
What is...
if I may display my ignorance...

72
00:10:47,142 --> 00:10:49,760
a peckerhead?

73
00:10:50,822 --> 00:10:52,829
Why are you laughing, Whalen?

74
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,592
Nothing, Richard.

75
00:10:54,662 --> 00:10:57,117
I was just thinking
how ignorance kills.

76
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:00,637
- What does that mean?
- Exactly.

77
00:11:01,478 --> 00:11:03,070
You ass-kissing little fuck!

78
00:11:04,102 --> 00:11:05,956
Boys!

79
00:11:09,862 --> 00:11:14,750
Perhaps yet another little sojourn
to the principal will serve you well?

80
00:11:16,965 --> 00:11:19,834
Want to know what a peckerhead is?

81
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:23,041
- That's a peckerhead.
- Thank you for the clarification.

82
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:27,581
Please send Principal Weathers
our hosannas!

83
00:11:32,677 --> 00:11:38,044
"Youth is wholly experimental."
Robert Louis Stevenson.

84
00:11:56,646 --> 00:11:58,020
I know.

85
00:12:16,518 --> 00:12:18,525
These seats taken?

86
00:12:18,598 --> 00:12:20,124
No. Go ahead.

87
00:12:28,358 --> 00:12:30,397
I am Gavin. This is U.V.

88
00:12:32,198 --> 00:12:33,954
I'm Steve.

89
00:12:34,982 --> 00:12:36,356
Munchies.

90
00:12:38,534 --> 00:12:40,868
U.V. Has some primo weed.

91
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:44,960
We smoked a fatty during gym.

92
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:48,226
Check him out.
He looks almost tan.

93
00:12:49,574 --> 00:12:52,192
Hello, Lorna.
How are you today, my dear?

94
00:12:52,262 --> 00:12:55,578
- Drop dead.
- Contact.

95
00:12:55,654 --> 00:12:59,516
- Who's that?
- That is Lorna "Love-itis" Longley.

96
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:03,899
Fire of my loins, purveyor
of my every masturbatory fantasy.

97
00:13:07,174 --> 00:13:09,824
The entire female gender
is separated into two groups.

98
00:13:09,894 --> 00:13:13,690
Lorna comprises one group.
All of womankind comprises the other.

99
00:13:13,766 --> 00:13:15,424
You ever take her out?

100
00:13:17,606 --> 00:13:22,177
Alas, Lorna is largely untouchable
for someone of my social standing.

101
00:13:22,246 --> 00:13:23,652
What do you mean?

102
00:13:23,718 --> 00:13:26,751
It's a class system
here at C.B. High, Stevie Boy.

103
00:13:28,038 --> 00:13:30,143
Check it out.

104
00:13:30,214 --> 00:13:32,635
There you got
your motorheads, car jocks.

105
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:35,230
All the world's a gasket
and a lube job and a pack of Luckys.

106
00:13:35,303 --> 00:13:38,564
Music of choice: Posi-traction
overdrive, classic rock...

107
00:13:38,631 --> 00:13:41,445
Skynyrd, The Allmans, Bruce.

108
00:13:41,511 --> 00:13:43,998
Drug of choice:
Beer, Miller Genuine Draft.

109
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:45,924
Keggers can't be choosers.

110
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:48,161
Freaks who fix leaks.

111
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,968
Over here you have
your microgeeks...

112
00:13:52,038 --> 00:13:55,485
nerds, whiz kids
and various other bottom feeders.

113
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:59,355
Music of choice:
The sound of an Apple PC booting up.

114
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:02,015
Drug of choice: Stephen Hawking's
"A Brief History of Time"...

115
00:14:02,086 --> 00:14:04,474
and a cup of jasmine tea
on a Saturday night.

116
00:14:04,551 --> 00:14:07,365
Freaks that go squeak.

117
00:14:07,431 --> 00:14:09,886
Over there you have your skaters.

118
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:12,325
Riffin', ragin' kids
and their ramp tramps.

119
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:15,204
Baggy pants, Dickie wools,
doing 50-50 grinds...

120
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:18,237
with a gnarly grab finish
on a homemade halfpipe in the woods.

121
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:21,059
Music of choice:
The whack of a hacky sack.

122
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:25,317
Drug of choice: Ecstasy, E-tab.
Baby, longer lovin' through science.

123
00:14:25,382 --> 00:14:27,204
Freaks in sneaks.

124
00:14:28,551 --> 00:14:31,485
Here's where it gets really nasty.

125
00:14:31,558 --> 00:14:34,721
Lorna runs with that group there,
the Blue Ribbons.

126
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,375
- What's that?
- It's a community group of good kids.

127
00:14:37,447 --> 00:14:39,170
Have bake sales, car washes.

128
00:14:39,238 --> 00:14:41,921
- Kiss a lot of adult sphincter.
- Blue Robots.

129
00:14:41,991 --> 00:14:44,096
Here, here.

130
00:14:44,167 --> 00:14:47,941
Those three guys: Cradle Bay's answer
to Manson, McVeigh and O.J.

131
00:14:48,007 --> 00:14:50,854
Trent Whalen, Andy Effkin,
Robby Stewart.

132
00:14:50,918 --> 00:14:54,812
I bet you didn't know that toast
came in three flavors.

133
00:14:54,886 --> 00:14:58,977
This group's music of choice: The hum
of perfection, the buzz of ambition.

134
00:14:59,046 --> 00:15:02,177
Drug of choice:
Life, the pursuit of clean living...

135
00:15:02,247 --> 00:15:04,996
at the expense of all who sniffle
at the hem of their gowns.

136
00:15:05,062 --> 00:15:07,450
Freaks, so chic.

137
00:15:08,838 --> 00:15:10,910
Then you got kids
like me and U.V.

138
00:15:10,983 --> 00:15:13,917
Lames who like our metal heavy,
our Marlboros light.

139
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:18,878
Music of choice: Harvester of Sorrow,
Language of the Mad.

140
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:22,884
Drug of choice:
What do you got?

141
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:24,924
Freaks all week.

142
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:30,848
That's it.
Lesson over.

143
00:15:30,918 --> 00:15:33,503
Class dismembered.

144
00:15:33,575 --> 00:15:36,095
Welcome to Cradle Bay High,
Stevie Boy.

145
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:38,108
Welcome to my nightmare.

146
00:16:03,398 --> 00:16:06,431
- Why can't we help you with your math?
- Just leave me alone.

147
00:16:07,783 --> 00:16:09,605
Hello.

148
00:16:15,719 --> 00:16:17,147
Phlegm.

149
00:16:19,463 --> 00:16:23,391
P-h-l-e-m-g-h.

150
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:26,693
- Wrong.
- Let me see that.

151
00:16:26,758 --> 00:16:31,067
- What are you two doing?
- We're having a spelling bee.

152
00:16:32,518 --> 00:16:34,274
My brother Allen
was the best speller.

153
00:16:35,719 --> 00:16:38,174
- I thought your name was Steve.
- It is.

154
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:42,690
Allen's my brother who died.

155
00:16:42,758 --> 00:16:44,514
I have a grandfather who died.

156
00:16:44,582 --> 00:16:46,491
Why don't we change the subject?

157
00:16:48,582 --> 00:16:51,516
- Pass your plate.
- Why?

158
00:16:52,487 --> 00:16:54,079
- You know why.
- Nathan.

159
00:16:58,278 --> 00:17:01,376
Shannon, do you get yelled at if you
talk about your dead grandfather?

160
00:17:01,447 --> 00:17:03,868
Around here people go crazy
if you talk about a dead brother.

161
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:31,749
Hello?

162
00:17:35,303 --> 00:17:37,986
I'm here for the Mustang parts.

163
00:17:41,159 --> 00:17:42,620
What the fuck?

164
00:17:43,815 --> 00:17:45,375
What are you doing here?

165
00:17:48,294 --> 00:17:51,076
The troops shall set you free.

166
00:17:58,343 --> 00:17:59,717
What do you guys want?

167
00:17:59,783 --> 00:18:02,019
Sweet Dickie, we want you.

168
00:18:02,086 --> 00:18:03,995
We've got it for you, Richard.

169
00:18:04,071 --> 00:18:07,070
We've got all the winning numbers.

170
00:18:19,207 --> 00:18:22,719
We like to welcome all new students.
Standard procedure.

171
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:26,685
As soon as Dr. Caldicott arrives,
we can begin.

172
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:28,449
Doctor?

173
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:31,682
He's the resident faculty fellow,
an outstanding educator.

174
00:18:31,751 --> 00:18:34,401
He's been with us two years now.

175
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:36,804
Works with the students
in a counseling capacity.

176
00:18:36,871 --> 00:18:38,659
I think you'll like him.

177
00:18:40,967 --> 00:18:43,814
I'm sorry I'm late. Hi.
Edgar Caldicott.

178
00:18:43,879 --> 00:18:46,267
It's nice
to finally meet you.

179
00:18:46,343 --> 00:18:48,579
- Everything okay?
- Fine.

180
00:18:48,647 --> 00:18:52,291
Have you given any thought
to extracurricular activities or sports?

181
00:18:52,358 --> 00:18:54,016
Not really.

182
00:18:54,087 --> 00:18:57,731
- There's the Blue Ribbons.
- The Blue Ribbons?

183
00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:00,351
Yeah. They help each other
study and practice.

184
00:19:00,423 --> 00:19:02,594
It's a team effort.

185
00:19:02,663 --> 00:19:04,517
It's a motivational workshop,
really.

186
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:06,754
The Blue Ribboners have
truly been making the grade...

187
00:19:06,823 --> 00:19:09,310
and doing wonderful things
on the playing field.

188
00:19:11,943 --> 00:19:16,133
All of us here are aware
of the tragedy back in Chicago.

189
00:19:16,199 --> 00:19:19,547
- If there's anything we can do...
- I said everything's fine.

190
00:19:22,663 --> 00:19:26,721
Steven,
we know how tough it can be.

191
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,060
Whether or not you want
to be involved with the school...

192
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:30,687
we want to be involved with you.

193
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:34,271
- That's all the meeting is about.
- Okay.

194
00:19:34,343 --> 00:19:36,350
So go make some new friends.

195
00:20:21,767 --> 00:20:25,509
- Like that?
- What is it?

196
00:20:26,727 --> 00:20:28,898
It's bona fide jitterbug.

197
00:20:28,967 --> 00:20:32,414
It's my buddy, Rachel.
Cook's Ridge trash.

198
00:20:32,487 --> 00:20:37,538
She's a great chick,
but she's Cook's Ridge trash.

199
00:20:37,607 --> 00:20:38,981
Come on.

200
00:20:41,287 --> 00:20:42,879
Dancing queen.

201
00:20:44,647 --> 00:20:46,239
Rachel, this is Stevie Boy.

202
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:47,772
Good man.

203
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:50,018
This is Rachel.
Cook's ridge trash.

204
00:20:50,087 --> 00:20:51,461
Bite me.

205
00:20:59,528 --> 00:21:01,916
Wow,
appropriate sparks are flying.

206
00:21:01,991 --> 00:21:03,845
Somebody cue the power ballad.

207
00:21:03,911 --> 00:21:05,285
Fail to be a tumor, Gavin.

208
00:21:07,527 --> 00:21:11,836
What do you say we cruise town,
chase a case...

209
00:21:11,911 --> 00:21:15,555
hit the bluff
and drink some beer?

210
00:21:15,623 --> 00:21:19,845
Consecrate Stevie Boy's arrival
to this new and pathetic tank town.

211
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:23,259
- You down?
- Sounds razor.

212
00:21:23,335 --> 00:21:24,709
Stevie Boy?

213
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:28,642
Sure.

214
00:21:34,023 --> 00:21:37,154
Excuse me, sir.
Can you help me out?

215
00:21:37,224 --> 00:21:39,874
- What?
- I'm trying to buy some beer.

216
00:21:39,944 --> 00:21:43,555
I have the money and everything,
I'm just a month from...

217
00:21:43,623 --> 00:21:45,630
Get off my case, kid.

218
00:21:48,584 --> 00:21:51,551
You know,
the problem with America...

219
00:21:53,544 --> 00:21:56,358
is mankind's
abject unwillingness...

220
00:21:56,424 --> 00:21:59,620
to contribute
to the delinquency of minors.

221
00:22:01,191 --> 00:22:03,460
That was like the tenth guy.

222
00:22:09,223 --> 00:22:11,230
- Chug.
- What are you doing?

223
00:22:11,303 --> 00:22:15,645
- Chasing. Nobody's willing.
- Yeah?

224
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,436
Hello, Charles.
Cycle any anabolic goodies lately?

225
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:24,027
- You're funny, Strick.
- Thanks. I'm here all week.

226
00:22:24,104 --> 00:22:28,413
A couple of us are going to the Yogurt
Shoppe later, if you want to come by.

227
00:22:28,487 --> 00:22:31,553
The Yogurt Shoppe?
Yeah.

228
00:22:31,623 --> 00:22:36,194
You want to make an "active culture"
joke here or should I handle this one?

229
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:40,737
- See you later.
- Bye.

230
00:22:49,959 --> 00:22:52,130
- What?
- What?

231
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,712
You're actually flattered
that barn door has a thing for you?

232
00:22:55,784 --> 00:22:58,205
- Bullshit.
- Right.

233
00:23:06,823 --> 00:23:08,862
There's for the syrup.

234
00:23:08,935 --> 00:23:11,422
Is that the right one
for the orange juice?

235
00:23:11,496 --> 00:23:15,270
Where's the deodorant coupon?
It's here somewhere.

236
00:23:16,775 --> 00:23:19,774
- What does a hooker say after 12 hours?
- What?

237
00:23:23,591 --> 00:23:26,307
Clean up on aisle four.

238
00:23:45,256 --> 00:23:47,078
Sorry.

239
00:23:53,351 --> 00:23:55,739
Come here!

240
00:24:10,791 --> 00:24:12,165
Easy.

241
00:24:12,232 --> 00:24:14,653
Fuck!
You Blue Ribbon shithead!

242
00:24:25,768 --> 00:24:27,939
What was that all about?

243
00:24:28,007 --> 00:24:29,599
Toxic Jock Syndrome.

244
00:24:29,671 --> 00:24:33,118
- You'll be fine.
- Where's my shake?

245
00:24:44,552 --> 00:24:47,202
What the hell would make a kid
freak out like that?

246
00:24:47,271 --> 00:24:51,045
It has to be steroids.
All those jocks are into it.

247
00:24:51,112 --> 00:24:54,723
Kelly Connor saw Andy Effkin bite
the head off a kitten in a fit of rage.

248
00:24:54,791 --> 00:24:56,962
- No way.
- I'm serious.

249
00:24:57,032 --> 00:24:58,886
I think it's bullshit, though.

250
00:24:58,952 --> 00:25:01,799
It is not bullshit,
and it's not steroids.

251
00:25:01,863 --> 00:25:04,099
- Here we go.
- What?

252
00:25:04,168 --> 00:25:07,135
Gavin thinks some sinister force is
taking over the Cradle Bay meatheads.

253
00:25:07,208 --> 00:25:11,201
- You know what it is.
- A sinister force?

254
00:25:11,272 --> 00:25:14,654
You know, evil.
Nowhere to turn, no one to trust.

255
00:25:14,728 --> 00:25:18,502
- Fail to be a bitch.
- Fail to be a pucker-ass.

256
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,963
- What?
- Nothing.

257
00:25:37,544 --> 00:25:39,300
Let's go!

258
00:25:45,767 --> 00:25:48,101
Andy killed her.

259
00:25:48,168 --> 00:25:50,502
Everyone's saying she ran away.

260
00:25:51,688 --> 00:25:54,655
I saw her dead body,
but I can't prove it.

261
00:25:54,728 --> 00:25:58,819
- Those fuckers.
- Why didn't you go to the police?

262
00:25:58,888 --> 00:26:01,702
Cox was there, man.

263
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:04,418
The cop didn't do shit.

264
00:26:04,488 --> 00:26:06,593
Fuck, nobody listens to me.

265
00:26:08,072 --> 00:26:10,438
Cancer Corner.

266
00:26:10,504 --> 00:26:13,318
Best place in the school
to sneak a smoke.

267
00:26:30,824 --> 00:26:33,212
What are you shitbirds
doing down here?

268
00:26:33,288 --> 00:26:36,636
- Relax, Mr. Newberry.
- You ain't supposed to be down here!

269
00:26:36,712 --> 00:26:39,745
This is my friend, Steve.
He's new to the Bay.

270
00:26:42,344 --> 00:26:44,198
Gnaw, gnaw, gnaw.

271
00:26:53,864 --> 00:26:55,718
Drag marks.

272
00:26:55,784 --> 00:26:58,850
Drag marks of a rat's tail.

273
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,091
What have you got there?

274
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,461
It's an "E-rat-icator."

275
00:27:03,528 --> 00:27:07,008
Sounds are supposed
to scare the rats away.

276
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,633
- You hear that?
- Yeah.

277
00:27:13,704 --> 00:27:16,289
Scary, ain't it?

278
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:20,004
Piece of crap.
Doesn't work worth spit!

279
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:24,767
A dollar for everything
that didn't work worth spit.

280
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:29,411
Mr. Newberry has the Boo-Radley-
village-idiot-Quasimodo thing going.

281
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,367
- Don't you?
- What?

282
00:27:31,432 --> 00:27:33,090
And he's currently involved...

283
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:36,389
in a war against the rodent population
of Cradle Bay.

284
00:27:41,928 --> 00:27:44,000
Gotta fight them!

285
00:27:45,032 --> 00:27:46,493
Rats from the bay.

286
00:27:48,872 --> 00:27:53,127
Incoming! You think you can run,
but you can't hide!

287
00:27:59,496 --> 00:28:02,594
- A day at the master races.
- Check that out.

288
00:28:04,424 --> 00:28:05,765
Jesus.

289
00:28:07,176 --> 00:28:09,663
Is that Dickie?
What is he doing?

290
00:28:10,536 --> 00:28:12,902
He's one of them now, bud.

291
00:28:12,968 --> 00:28:15,139
He's a Blue Robot.

292
00:28:15,208 --> 00:28:17,117
Watch and learn.

293
00:28:17,192 --> 00:28:19,046
What the fuck?

294
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:27,164
They're peckerheads. Look at him.
He's killing his hard-on.

295
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,898
Fore!

296
00:28:28,968 --> 00:28:31,269
Maybe he turned over a new leaf.

297
00:28:31,337 --> 00:28:34,271
I would like to own the new leaf
concession here in Cradle Bay.

298
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,901
Did you tell Steve
about the murders?

299
00:28:40,968 --> 00:28:42,877
Steve is a disbeliever.

300
00:28:42,952 --> 00:28:47,686
The mysterious disappearance of Mary Jo
Copeland and Officer Kramer? Uh-huh.

301
00:28:47,752 --> 00:28:50,118
This is where he accuses me
of being paranoid.

302
00:28:50,185 --> 00:28:54,494
"Denial" ain't just
a river in Italy, bud.

303
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:58,630
Check your weed, boys.

304
00:28:58,696 --> 00:29:01,729
- You are beige, boy.
- See you, Rachel.

305
00:29:01,801 --> 00:29:03,459
Bye.

306
00:29:16,905 --> 00:29:20,221
Here's your chocolate sundae.
Hope you guys...

307
00:29:25,576 --> 00:29:27,266
Can I help you?

308
00:29:27,336 --> 00:29:30,085
Steven, good to see you, brother.

309
00:29:31,944 --> 00:29:33,318
Come sit down.

310
00:29:38,056 --> 00:29:41,503
Steven, this is Kathy, Andy...

311
00:29:41,576 --> 00:29:43,747
- Tom, Randi...
- Hi.

312
00:29:43,816 --> 00:29:46,150
Lorna, Chug.

313
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:48,835
You know Robby and Dickie.

314
00:29:48,904 --> 00:29:50,878
This is Steven.
Sit down.

315
00:29:50,952 --> 00:29:53,123
Steven's new to the Bay
from Chicago.

316
00:29:54,792 --> 00:29:57,923
- Do you like it here?
- Yeah, it's okay.

317
00:29:57,992 --> 00:30:00,642
You had friends in Chicago?

318
00:30:01,673 --> 00:30:03,101
Yeah.

319
00:30:04,809 --> 00:30:06,303
You can have friends here.

320
00:30:12,073 --> 00:30:14,560
Didn't you guys get in a fight
in English?

321
00:30:14,632 --> 00:30:16,486
We've made peace.

322
00:30:16,552 --> 00:30:18,886
That's what separates us
from the animals.

323
00:30:21,129 --> 00:30:22,241
Dirtbag alert.

324
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:31,905
- I gotta talk to you.
- Easy, slick. Steven's relaxing.

325
00:30:38,153 --> 00:30:43,041
The Yogurt Shoppe.
What the fuck is a "shoppy"?

326
00:30:43,112 --> 00:30:45,250
Why don't you
make like a tree and leave?

327
00:30:45,321 --> 00:30:48,320
Clever girl.
Come on, Steve.

328
00:30:48,392 --> 00:30:51,141
We get in one argument,
and you go bond with these guys?

329
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,988
What happened to you?
Did you eat too much flank steak?

330
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:08,322
- Let's go.
- You don't have to go, brother.

331
00:31:11,912 --> 00:31:13,286
I'm not your brother.

332
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:26,343
You wanted to tell me something?
Here I am. What?

333
00:31:26,409 --> 00:31:29,856
- They're hypnotized.
- What?

334
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:34,663
Maybe not hypnotized, but brainwashed,
lobotomized, programmed.

335
00:31:34,729 --> 00:31:38,340
Want proof?
Here. Here's proof.

336
00:31:40,008 --> 00:31:43,782
Look.
That's Robby, Randi, Trent.

337
00:31:43,848 --> 00:31:45,604
They used to be my friends.

338
00:31:48,585 --> 00:31:51,072
Maybe they got sick of your rap.
I can relate.

339
00:31:51,145 --> 00:31:53,959
I thought you'd say that. That is
the purpose of tonight's excursion.

340
00:31:54,025 --> 00:31:57,341
After tonight,
you'll strap on a hog and be a man.

341
00:32:06,184 --> 00:32:09,532
It's something that benefits everybody.
The Thespian Society, for example...

342
00:32:09,609 --> 00:32:12,838
Blue Ribbon meeting.
Every Monday.

343
00:32:12,904 --> 00:32:15,238
This is where the shit goes down.
Listen.

344
00:32:15,305 --> 00:32:18,436
By conducting the bake sale
in conjunction with the pep rally...

345
00:32:18,505 --> 00:32:23,774
we can be selling cakes and cookies
when school spirit is at its optimum.

346
00:32:23,849 --> 00:32:27,144
I had no idea
the evil was this pervasive.

347
00:32:28,105 --> 00:32:29,533
Jan, what's on your mind?

348
00:32:30,569 --> 00:32:33,154
This may sound strange, but...

349
00:32:33,224 --> 00:32:36,671
although we couldn't be more pleased
with Andrew's improved studies...

350
00:32:36,745 --> 00:32:40,519
he's become somewhat different...

351
00:32:40,585 --> 00:32:43,967
since returning from your weekend
enlightenment seminar.

352
00:32:44,041 --> 00:32:45,535
Different how?

353
00:32:45,609 --> 00:32:50,115
He seems unkind to almost everyone
outside of the club.

354
00:32:50,185 --> 00:32:53,381
I can understand your concern.
Let me address it.

355
00:32:53,449 --> 00:32:58,500
Kids being kids
have a tendency to overreact.

356
00:32:58,569 --> 00:33:01,056
We've found they go through
a brief period...

357
00:33:01,129 --> 00:33:03,976
of being,
shall we say, snobby.

358
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:08,928
But what it really is
is a feeling that's new to them.

359
00:33:09,001 --> 00:33:10,888
The feeling is pride.

360
00:33:10,952 --> 00:33:12,577
They're improved.

361
00:33:12,649 --> 00:33:17,253
When you soar with the eagles,
the pigeons below look pedestrian.

362
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:20,102
- Give it a little time.
- Dork.

363
00:33:20,169 --> 00:33:23,016
Now, a new candidate
has been nominated.

364
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,730
His parents have been counseled
and consented.

365
00:33:25,801 --> 00:33:27,972
Colleen, if you will.

366
00:33:30,345 --> 00:33:32,766
- Male, 17 years old...
- Superstar.

367
00:33:32,841 --> 00:33:35,207
Suspended four times
last school year.

368
00:33:35,273 --> 00:33:37,411
Parents feel
candidate is depressed...

369
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:41,440
spending too much time listening
to rock music and masturbating.

370
00:33:41,513 --> 00:33:44,065
- Candidate has a history of truancy...
- Poor son of a bitch.

371
00:33:44,137 --> 00:33:47,104
And a general lack of direction.

372
00:33:47,177 --> 00:33:52,065
Candidate is C-minus student,
yet has A-plus potential.

373
00:33:53,513 --> 00:33:54,887
All in favor?

374
00:33:58,537 --> 00:34:01,384
Great.
February candidate confirmed.

375
00:34:01,449 --> 00:34:04,034
- Training to begin ASAP.
- Shit.

376
00:34:04,105 --> 00:34:07,203
- What?
- Join me in welcoming to our circle...

377
00:34:07,273 --> 00:34:09,728
Ernest and Lucille Strick...

378
00:34:09,801 --> 00:34:12,703
the parents of our next superstar,
Gavin Strick.

379
00:34:15,017 --> 00:34:18,464
They want you to join their club.
Shine them on and blow them off.

380
00:34:18,537 --> 00:34:21,351
- What are they gonna do?
- You still don't get it.

381
00:34:21,417 --> 00:34:25,345
You still think this is
about blood drives and bake sales.

382
00:34:27,337 --> 00:34:28,711
Wait a second.

383
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:31,327
Maybe you should
lay off that shit.

384
00:34:31,401 --> 00:34:33,189
Maybe you should eat me.

385
00:34:33,257 --> 00:34:35,264
Yeah.

386
00:34:35,337 --> 00:34:40,421
This is huge.
Why don't you see this is fucking huge?

387
00:34:40,489 --> 00:34:43,041
Don't fucking "Gavin" me.
I'm a dead man.

388
00:34:43,112 --> 00:34:46,243
My parents sold me out.
You saw it. You were there.

389
00:34:46,313 --> 00:34:48,167
Why don't you see this?

390
00:34:49,832 --> 00:34:51,522
Stay at my house tonight.

391
00:34:57,353 --> 00:34:58,978
I have to go home.

392
00:34:59,049 --> 00:35:04,002
When I get there and they're waiting for
me, I'll smoke them all. You hear me?

393
00:35:04,073 --> 00:35:08,677
Everyone who's at my house:
Robby, Whalen, Caldicott, even my olds.

394
00:35:08,745 --> 00:35:11,200
- Give me the gun.
- No fucking way.

395
00:35:16,745 --> 00:35:19,232
- Let me have it!
- No! You're losing it!

396
00:35:19,305 --> 00:35:21,606
You'll wind up
shooting the paperboy.

397
00:35:23,593 --> 00:35:25,981
- Just go home.
- Give me my fucking gun.

398
00:35:31,466 --> 00:35:33,222
Good night.

399
00:35:36,169 --> 00:35:38,307
Don't leave me alone like this!

400
00:35:43,369 --> 00:35:44,743
Stevie Boy?

401
00:35:46,249 --> 00:35:50,504
I would have smoked them all.
Fuck, man.

402
00:36:20,809 --> 00:36:22,565
Wait a minute.

403
00:36:28,489 --> 00:36:30,081
- What is this?
- I don't believe...

404
00:36:30,153 --> 00:36:31,745
Show time.

405
00:36:39,305 --> 00:36:41,028
Who put the acid in my Spam?

406
00:36:55,786 --> 00:36:58,436
- Hello.
- What is up with this?

407
00:36:58,505 --> 00:37:00,195
I just want to apply myself.

408
00:37:00,265 --> 00:37:02,915
I think I'll get better results
on this side of the caf.

409
00:37:02,985 --> 00:37:05,952
Beat it, honey.
This is rarefied turf.

410
00:37:06,025 --> 00:37:07,879
Sluts need not apply.

411
00:37:09,865 --> 00:37:11,239
Later.

412
00:37:22,922 --> 00:37:24,482
How much do I owe you?

413
00:37:24,553 --> 00:37:28,164
- Treat yourself.
- Indeed.

414
00:37:35,721 --> 00:37:39,397
- Where you going?
- I'm going to talk to Gavin.

415
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:42,017
You're not wanted, Steven.
Just leave him be.

416
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:46,405
Get the fuck off me.

417
00:37:47,913 --> 00:37:49,538
Guys, come on.

418
00:37:51,722 --> 00:37:53,380
What's your maladjustment?

419
00:38:05,385 --> 00:38:06,846
You okay?

420
00:38:13,929 --> 00:38:15,783
Forget it! Stop it!

421
00:38:21,705 --> 00:38:22,784
That's enough!

422
00:38:38,281 --> 00:38:40,004
What happened to you?

423
00:38:41,322 --> 00:38:43,907
We shall overcome, Steven.

424
00:38:45,801 --> 00:38:49,892
- You okay?
- Man, fantastic.

425
00:39:00,361 --> 00:39:01,735
You'll see.

426
00:39:19,241 --> 00:39:20,767
Retard.

427
00:39:22,506 --> 00:39:23,880
Are you okay?

428
00:40:17,418 --> 00:40:19,425
What are you doing here?

429
00:40:19,498 --> 00:40:21,985
You're not supposed to be here.

430
00:40:22,057 --> 00:40:25,220
- I hate the caf.
- Everybody hates the caf.

431
00:40:26,314 --> 00:40:28,168
They hate the ketchup.

432
00:40:28,234 --> 00:40:29,760
I got...

433
00:40:29,833 --> 00:40:32,320
That's not good.

434
00:40:34,762 --> 00:40:36,485
Doesn't even look like ketchup.

435
00:40:36,553 --> 00:40:37,927
"Slaughterhouse-Five"?

436
00:40:37,994 --> 00:40:40,896
What? Give me that!

437
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:42,726
What the hell's the matter with you?

438
00:40:45,674 --> 00:40:49,602
You rats from the Bay.
You rats!

439
00:40:49,674 --> 00:40:51,364
Rats everywhere.

440
00:40:51,434 --> 00:40:55,045
You kids think you know everything!
You don't know nothing!

441
00:40:55,114 --> 00:40:56,968
Forget the rats.
It's all an act.

442
00:40:57,034 --> 00:40:59,205
- You don't know.
- It's all bullshit.

443
00:40:59,274 --> 00:41:01,761
Get away from me!

444
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:06,184
Brother!

445
00:41:20,586 --> 00:41:21,960
Wait.

446
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:27,718
Do you like Kurt Vonnegut?

447
00:41:41,066 --> 00:41:42,440
I don't get it.

448
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:48,835
Didn't you ever want
to just disappear, lunch boy?

449
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:51,304
Poof, you're gone.

450
00:41:52,586 --> 00:41:57,375
You'd be surprised
how interesting people become...

451
00:41:57,450 --> 00:42:00,264
when they think
you are really stupid.

452
00:42:31,242 --> 00:42:34,438
- Who is it?
- Calm down, Steven.

453
00:42:38,954 --> 00:42:41,637
Where you going, Steven?

454
00:42:41,706 --> 00:42:45,153
- There's nothing to be afraid of.
- Here is the light, Steven.

455
00:43:04,266 --> 00:43:05,640
Hello, Steven.

456
00:43:05,706 --> 00:43:07,134
What are you doing here?

457
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:10,886
- I'm tutoring Lindsay in Algebra.
- Where is she?

458
00:43:12,906 --> 00:43:15,655
- Where's my sister?
- She's upstairs sleeping.

459
00:43:15,722 --> 00:43:17,729
- Where are my parents?
- At a meeting.

460
00:43:17,802 --> 00:43:19,656
- What meeting?
- Steven, you're hurt.

461
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:23,333
- I'll live.
- Let me put something on that.

462
00:43:23,402 --> 00:43:24,776
It's fine.

463
00:43:26,922 --> 00:43:28,776
Maybe you should go.

464
00:43:30,122 --> 00:43:31,496
I mean it.

465
00:43:31,562 --> 00:43:35,817
- If that's what you want.
- Yeah.

466
00:43:35,882 --> 00:43:37,889
Can I go to the bathroom first?

467
00:43:38,922 --> 00:43:41,288
Sure.
It's around the corner.

468
00:43:41,354 --> 00:43:43,077
I know where it is.

469
00:43:43,146 --> 00:43:46,179
Of course you do. Everyone knows
where everything is around here.

470
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:49,598
Your sister's a great kid.
She's very special.

471
00:44:41,418 --> 00:44:42,879
Hello, Steven.

472
00:44:44,938 --> 00:44:48,832
- What are you doing?
- I'm not sure really.

473
00:44:50,635 --> 00:44:52,009
Go home, Lorna.

474
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:58,719
- You don't find me slightly attractive?
- You're very attractive.

475
00:44:58,794 --> 00:45:01,281
It's just that you're a Blue Ribbon
and I'm not.

476
00:45:01,354 --> 00:45:02,728
So...

477
00:45:07,915 --> 00:45:09,671
Wait a second.

478
00:45:13,034 --> 00:45:14,976
I'm not supposed
to be doing this.

479
00:45:16,555 --> 00:45:19,042
It's bad, wrong.

480
00:45:21,066 --> 00:45:23,400
It's not bad. It's...
Jesus Christ.

481
00:46:01,354 --> 00:46:05,761
I have to go home.
I have a big physics test tomorrow.

482
00:46:17,291 --> 00:46:18,817
After extracting the implant...

483
00:46:18,891 --> 00:46:22,186
I tested its integrity
to the optic nerve, and it was intact.

484
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:24,192
The chip is functioning properly.

485
00:46:24,267 --> 00:46:27,682
But I did find that excess stimulation
to the pineal gland...

486
00:46:27,754 --> 00:46:30,503
caused the dopamine levels
to go through the roof.

487
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:35,679
Every time one of these kids gets
a hard-on, they beat somebody with it.

488
00:46:35,754 --> 00:46:37,696
We could do a cingulotomy.

489
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:40,933
No. Cut a craniotomy flap.
I'll get elbow deep, see what happens.

490
00:46:41,002 --> 00:46:43,554
- What?
- Cut the bruises out of the banana.

491
00:46:43,626 --> 00:46:45,480
What about her parents?

492
00:46:45,546 --> 00:46:49,702
Tell them she'll be missing
cheerleading practice this week.

493
00:46:52,651 --> 00:46:55,618
Look. Cook's Ridge trash.

494
00:46:55,691 --> 00:46:59,881
Once you've all settled in,
I'm sure she'll fit in just fine.

495
00:46:59,946 --> 00:47:02,182
- Thanks, Dr. Caldicott.
- Did you hear that, Nancy?

496
00:47:02,251 --> 00:47:04,073
Yeah, Mom.

497
00:47:12,107 --> 00:47:14,441
Come on, let's go.
I gotta sell this bud.

498
00:47:14,506 --> 00:47:17,156
I got two customers left.

499
00:47:17,226 --> 00:47:20,357
If this keeps up,
I'll be the 7-Eleven guy.

500
00:47:22,347 --> 00:47:24,518
I'm gonna grab a smoke.

501
00:47:39,402 --> 00:47:43,111
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

502
00:47:49,707 --> 00:47:51,845
I saw you come down here,
Rachel.

503
00:47:51,915 --> 00:47:53,802
I just want
to ask you something.

504
00:48:02,635 --> 00:48:04,009
What do you want?

505
00:48:09,867 --> 00:48:12,201
I just want to know...

506
00:48:12,267 --> 00:48:14,983
It's me asking, not my friends.

507
00:48:18,027 --> 00:48:19,455
Will you go out with me?

508
00:48:23,531 --> 00:48:24,905
You're kidding, right?

509
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:29,321
Will you, please?

510
00:48:30,987 --> 00:48:32,481
No, Chug, I won't.

511
00:48:32,554 --> 00:48:34,179
Why not?

512
00:48:36,811 --> 00:48:38,217
How about this?

513
00:48:38,283 --> 00:48:41,479
You couldn't repulse me more if you
were made out of shit and maggots!

514
00:48:41,547 --> 00:48:43,303
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

515
00:48:43,370 --> 00:48:46,217
- You want to be that way?
- Stop it. I'll scream. I swear to God.

516
00:48:46,283 --> 00:48:47,657
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

517
00:48:47,723 --> 00:48:49,283
What will happen if you do?

518
00:48:49,355 --> 00:48:51,558
I'm a Blue Ribbon, baby.
Team captain.

519
00:48:51,627 --> 00:48:54,693
You're just a trashy,
tattooed love doll.

520
00:48:54,763 --> 00:48:57,697
Come on, Rae-Rae, give up
the plate for Chug. Come on!

521
00:49:00,587 --> 00:49:01,928
Fuck!

522
00:49:23,403 --> 00:49:24,897
Stop it!

523
00:49:46,283 --> 00:49:47,875
What you looking at, retard?

524
00:50:04,907 --> 00:50:06,281
Wow.

525
00:50:09,483 --> 00:50:12,549
I guess I just think
you should try and fit in.

526
00:50:12,619 --> 00:50:14,953
We're gonna be here
for a long time.

527
00:50:15,019 --> 00:50:16,873
You, me, Mom and Dad.

528
00:50:17,899 --> 00:50:19,273
And Chip and Dale.

529
00:50:24,075 --> 00:50:26,114
- What is this?
- What?

530
00:50:26,187 --> 00:50:28,096
- Where did you get this?
- I got it at school.

531
00:50:28,171 --> 00:50:30,887
They were handing them out.
We all got one.

532
00:50:35,275 --> 00:50:37,347
- Go inside.
- Why?

533
00:50:39,883 --> 00:50:43,199
- I said go inside!
- Spaz.

534
00:51:19,819 --> 00:51:23,114
- We should talk.
- Yeah.

535
00:51:25,355 --> 00:51:27,209
There's something
you need to see.

536
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:40,149
Rae, Gavin Strick here.

537
00:51:42,369 --> 00:51:44,223
Live and unplugged.

538
00:51:46,657 --> 00:51:49,591
Guess if you found this,
then you know.

539
00:51:51,042 --> 00:51:53,245
Am I hanging
with Trent and Robby...

540
00:51:53,314 --> 00:51:55,769
and the rest of the Robots?

541
00:51:56,993 --> 00:51:58,781
God, I hope not.

542
00:52:01,729 --> 00:52:05,503
I hit the vents tonight
when I split up with Stevie Boy.

543
00:52:05,569 --> 00:52:07,903
He doesn't believe.

544
00:52:07,970 --> 00:52:09,496
I went back to school...

545
00:52:09,569 --> 00:52:13,147
and I overheard Caldicott
talking to some wonk.

546
00:52:13,218 --> 00:52:16,120
Mentioned "Bishop Flats Eleven."

547
00:52:16,194 --> 00:52:19,870
Caldicott called them his children.

548
00:52:19,938 --> 00:52:22,621
Then he freaked out on the guy
and kicked him out of his office.

549
00:52:22,689 --> 00:52:24,696
So, I figure something's up
with that.

550
00:52:28,257 --> 00:52:32,632
Keep an eye on U.V. For me,
though I doubt they'll want him.

551
00:52:32,705 --> 00:52:36,599
I doubt they're interested
in the pigmentally challenged.

552
00:52:36,674 --> 00:52:38,048
That's not their style.

553
00:52:41,633 --> 00:52:43,999
I have to go get paranoid.

554
00:52:45,314 --> 00:52:46,688
This is Gavin Strick...

555
00:52:46,753 --> 00:52:50,779
reporting live
from The Reconstruction.

556
00:52:57,505 --> 00:52:59,359
I pulled this off the AMA database.

557
00:53:00,418 --> 00:53:01,792
Caldicott's last
place of employment...

558
00:53:01,857 --> 00:53:04,507
was across the bay
in Bishop Flats...

559
00:53:04,577 --> 00:53:06,399
at the Bellknop Psychiatric Facility.

560
00:53:07,457 --> 00:53:10,752
He spent seven years
doing neuropharmacology.

561
00:53:10,818 --> 00:53:12,192
Mind control.

562
00:53:16,034 --> 00:53:17,408
Next ferry's at 6:00.

563
00:53:19,906 --> 00:53:22,556
- Bishop Flats?
- You down for it?

564
00:53:29,441 --> 00:53:30,815
Razor.

565
00:53:30,882 --> 00:53:32,256
Let's go.

566
00:53:38,946 --> 00:53:42,241
- I miss Gavin. He's almost like a...
- A brother?

567
00:53:45,249 --> 00:53:47,103
Yeah, exactly.

568
00:53:55,234 --> 00:53:57,437
I had a brother.

569
00:53:59,074 --> 00:54:00,732
Sorry.

570
00:54:00,801 --> 00:54:05,176
His name was Allen.
He was a couple years older than me.

571
00:54:05,249 --> 00:54:08,827
If he had made it through his teens,
he would have been amazing.

572
00:54:10,049 --> 00:54:13,048
But he was always in pain.

573
00:54:16,642 --> 00:54:20,089
And eight months
to the day he shot himself...

574
00:54:20,161 --> 00:54:22,332
Dad said we were moving
to Cradle Bay...

575
00:54:26,466 --> 00:54:29,116
where everything
was gonna be all right.

576
00:54:33,345 --> 00:54:35,646
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't.

577
00:54:39,074 --> 00:54:40,502
Let's go.

578
00:54:56,162 --> 00:54:57,722
Maybe this isn't a good idea.

579
00:55:01,698 --> 00:55:03,224
Think of it
as our first date.

580
00:56:00,418 --> 00:56:02,806
That's why my toothes are clean.

581
00:56:07,362 --> 00:56:08,768
Be pretty...

582
00:56:08,834 --> 00:56:12,762
and do it just right.

583
00:56:21,474 --> 00:56:23,710
Children.

584
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:32,442
Meet the musical little creatures...

585
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:34,368
that hide among the flowers.

586
00:57:08,002 --> 00:57:09,376
Shut up.

587
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:28,792
Let's get out of here.

588
00:57:36,066 --> 00:57:37,920
It's Caldicott's daughter.

589
00:58:03,010 --> 00:58:05,148
His own daughter.

590
00:58:05,218 --> 00:58:08,087
How can nobody not know there's
something fucked up in Bishop Flat?

591
00:58:08,162 --> 00:58:10,911
Shit, his own daughter was in there.
Nobody's safe.

592
00:58:20,803 --> 00:58:23,453
The last ferry leaves at 11:30.

593
00:58:23,522 --> 00:58:25,529
Tell me you have a razor plan.

594
00:58:25,603 --> 00:58:30,491
- I am making this shit up as I go.
- Great.

595
00:58:38,722 --> 00:58:40,096
Shit.

596
00:58:58,562 --> 00:59:00,088
Hi, Officer Cox.

597
00:59:00,163 --> 00:59:01,951
Closing time, Frankie.

598
00:59:02,018 --> 00:59:04,254
Yeah, it's getting late.

599
00:59:04,322 --> 00:59:06,176
Just be cool.

600
00:59:10,211 --> 00:59:11,672
It's past curfew.

601
00:59:11,746 --> 00:59:13,600
She's driving me home.

602
00:59:15,490 --> 00:59:17,278
- From?
- Studying.

603
00:59:20,130 --> 00:59:21,918
Where are your books?

604
00:59:43,234 --> 00:59:46,332
- Evening, Officer.
- What are you doing?

605
00:59:46,402 --> 00:59:48,823
I'm getting rid of rats.

606
00:59:49,954 --> 00:59:54,656
The pink-eyed vermin
can't see for spit.

607
00:59:54,723 --> 00:59:56,249
Quarter a rat.

608
00:59:56,322 --> 00:59:59,617
Town council gives me
a quarter a rat.

609
01:00:00,835 --> 01:00:04,413
I'm going to be rich at this rate.
I'll be on...

610
01:00:04,483 --> 01:00:06,849
- "Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous."
- Moron.

611
01:00:10,274 --> 01:00:13,470
- Where are you going?
- Can we go now?

612
01:00:13,538 --> 01:00:15,959
Step out of the truck, now.

613
01:00:21,282 --> 01:00:23,670
- What are you doing?
- Hey!

614
01:00:24,739 --> 01:00:27,586
Let her go!
What do you want from us?

615
01:00:27,650 --> 01:00:29,537
Get in here.

616
01:00:35,203 --> 01:00:36,959
That's a big rat.

617
01:00:42,019 --> 01:00:46,525
Come on, get out of there!
What are you waiting for? Get!

618
01:00:53,123 --> 01:00:54,497
Let's get out of here.

619
01:01:03,843 --> 01:01:05,850
Come on, Steve.

620
01:01:16,515 --> 01:01:19,930
You have to trust me for now.
Do you trust me?

621
01:01:24,675 --> 01:01:26,201
Where are you going?

622
01:01:27,651 --> 01:01:30,684
I'm taking Lindsay away from here.
We're going back to Chicago.

623
01:01:30,754 --> 01:01:34,070
- Don't do this. You're scaring me.
- I'm scared too, Mom, believe me.

624
01:01:34,147 --> 01:01:36,994
Stevie, you have to know
we're here for you no matter what.

625
01:01:40,898 --> 01:01:44,061
- God, do you really mean that?
- Of course we do.

626
01:01:44,130 --> 01:01:49,312
- Then let's all go home.
- Steven, you are home.

627
01:01:49,379 --> 01:01:53,569
Cradle Bay is where you belong.
Here with your family.

628
01:01:53,634 --> 01:01:55,226
You signed me up
for the program?

629
01:01:55,298 --> 01:01:57,686
- We want what's best for you.
- What about what I want?

630
01:01:57,763 --> 01:02:00,545
Look, Steven,
do you really like the way you feel?

631
01:02:00,610 --> 01:02:02,682
Shut the fuck up!

632
01:02:02,755 --> 01:02:05,210
You sold me out.

633
01:02:05,283 --> 01:02:07,901
- We didn't. We just want you back.
- Steven, please...

634
01:02:07,971 --> 01:02:09,596
My name is Steve, okay?

635
01:02:09,667 --> 01:02:11,805
Nobody calls me Steven
except for them.

636
01:02:14,915 --> 01:02:16,954
Fine. Come on, Linds.

637
01:02:30,499 --> 01:02:32,702
May I have this dance?

638
01:02:32,771 --> 01:02:34,297
Where's Rachel?

639
01:02:34,371 --> 01:02:36,923
She's gone to an institute
of higher learning, Steven.

640
01:02:40,803 --> 01:02:43,999
- Help!
- Everything's under control.

641
01:02:44,899 --> 01:02:45,913
Who's your daddy?

642
01:03:02,531 --> 01:03:04,353
Respect yourself, Steven.

643
01:03:06,371 --> 01:03:08,225
Ice, ice, baby.

644
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:18,046
It's not what you think.

645
01:03:18,115 --> 01:03:20,416
It's a new kind of cool.

646
01:03:20,482 --> 01:03:22,587
You feel better, freer.

647
01:03:22,658 --> 01:03:25,276
I've never felt so alive
in my life.

648
01:03:25,347 --> 01:03:28,892
- It's humanity's sacred essence.
- A new and finer age.

649
01:03:28,963 --> 01:03:30,239
Go forward.

650
01:03:33,218 --> 01:03:34,974
Be the ball.

651
01:04:18,531 --> 01:04:20,636
People will know
when I get out of here.

652
01:04:20,707 --> 01:04:22,943
That's right, they will know.

653
01:04:23,011 --> 01:04:25,531
They'll know
because you'll be better.

654
01:04:27,811 --> 01:04:29,665
Adolescence is a minefield.

655
01:04:31,747 --> 01:04:36,056
But soon, you'll be fully equipped
to walk right through it.

656
01:04:36,131 --> 01:04:38,586
Yeah, straight A's
and a letter jacket.

657
01:04:38,659 --> 01:04:40,698
And every now and then,
you rape and kill.

658
01:04:40,771 --> 01:04:43,007
To cure cancer,
you gotta kill a few white mice.

659
01:04:44,163 --> 01:04:47,511
Meet the musical
little creatures...

660
01:04:47,587 --> 01:04:48,993
that hide among the flowers.

661
01:04:51,939 --> 01:04:53,793
That's a battle I didn't win.

662
01:04:56,803 --> 01:05:00,250
You'll be different.

663
01:05:00,323 --> 01:05:02,657
I know so much more now.

664
01:05:04,868 --> 01:05:07,682
She wasn't that bright
to begin with.

665
01:05:16,036 --> 01:05:18,141
Be all that's good.

666
01:05:18,211 --> 01:05:20,185
Stop fooling around.

667
01:05:20,259 --> 01:05:22,364
Let the light in.

668
01:05:29,635 --> 01:05:33,857
Be excellent.
You're number one. You're an ace.

669
01:05:35,043 --> 01:05:36,417
Achieve.

670
01:06:41,155 --> 01:06:43,009
You'll be okay.

671
01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:08,027
Going somewhere
with my custard, Steven?

672
01:07:11,107 --> 01:07:12,535
Let's go, Chug.

673
01:07:12,611 --> 01:07:15,327
That's my girl you got there.

674
01:07:15,395 --> 01:07:17,085
I can't let you take her.

675
01:07:25,891 --> 01:07:27,385
Come on! Get up!

676
01:07:37,315 --> 01:07:40,129
Come on, Rae-Rae,
give up the plate for old Chug.

677
01:07:55,555 --> 01:07:56,929
Come on.

678
01:08:12,676 --> 01:08:15,163
- Not so fast.
- What?

679
01:08:15,236 --> 01:08:17,308
What's the capital
of North Dakota?

680
01:08:17,379 --> 01:08:19,037
How the fuck should I know?

681
01:08:20,067 --> 01:08:22,074
Okay, you're cool.
Get in.

682
01:08:22,147 --> 01:08:25,725
We gotta book.
Early bird ferry's in 20 minutes.

683
01:08:40,771 --> 01:08:42,713
Shit, man.

684
01:09:00,772 --> 01:09:03,455
It's time
to leave mediocrity behind.

685
01:09:04,483 --> 01:09:05,944
Step up on the bus.

686
01:09:18,148 --> 01:09:19,522
What is it?

687
01:09:43,620 --> 01:09:45,954
Come and get it,
you blue bastards!

688
01:09:51,780 --> 01:09:53,722
What is going on?

689
01:09:54,980 --> 01:09:56,987
Come on.

690
01:09:57,060 --> 01:09:58,914
Get them to the ferry.

691
01:10:00,740 --> 01:10:02,594
I'll meet you down there.

692
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:07,707
Don't leave without me.

693
01:10:30,916 --> 01:10:33,371
- Lunch boy.
- What are you doing?

694
01:10:33,443 --> 01:10:38,494
We can't very well
have these shitbirds...

695
01:10:38,564 --> 01:10:40,418
graduating and going off
into the world.

696
01:10:41,284 --> 01:10:42,844
Maybe they can be helped.

697
01:10:42,916 --> 01:10:46,079
No, they can't.
And neither can I.

698
01:10:49,284 --> 01:10:52,415
Do good things, lunch boy.

699
01:11:04,644 --> 01:11:07,360
Hey, teacher!

700
01:11:09,124 --> 01:11:10,716
Leave those kids alone!

701
01:11:28,612 --> 01:11:32,441
It's over, you son of a bitch.
It's finished.

702
01:11:32,516 --> 01:11:33,890
"Finished"?

703
01:11:35,652 --> 01:11:37,375
There will always be other towns...

704
01:11:37,444 --> 01:11:39,713
and other troubled teens...

705
01:11:39,780 --> 01:11:41,241
and other worried parents.

706
01:11:41,316 --> 01:11:43,355
Science is God.

707
01:12:12,356 --> 01:12:14,210
Be the ball.

708
01:13:02,308 --> 01:13:06,334
- What happened?
- We're the only ones left.

709
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:12,354
So, what do we do now?

710
01:13:13,764 --> 01:13:15,618
We go home.

711
01:13:17,572 --> 01:13:19,033
And where's that?

712
01:13:21,508 --> 01:13:23,613
Wherever.

713
01:13:23,684 --> 01:13:25,626
Wherever we are.

714
01:13:29,796 --> 01:13:32,698
Appropriate sparks are flying.

715
01:13:34,277 --> 01:13:36,665
Somebody cue up
the power ballad, man.

716
01:13:54,980 --> 01:13:56,703
All right now, settle down.

717
01:13:56,772 --> 01:13:58,746
Turn that damn thing off.

718
01:13:58,820 --> 01:14:01,634
Now, y'all got a new student teacher
starting today.

719
01:14:01,700 --> 01:14:04,667
I want you to show him a little bit
more respect than the last one.

720
01:14:05,957 --> 01:14:07,331
Speak of the devil.

721
01:14:20,676 --> 01:14:23,905
Say hello to your
new student teacher, class.

722
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:27,994
They're all yours.

723
01:14:28,068 --> 01:14:29,496
Peckerhead.

724
01:14:34,085 --> 01:14:36,768
Hello, class.
Welcome.

725
01:19:58,149 --> 01:20:00,799
Be excellent.

726
01:20:00,869 --> 01:20:04,480
Yes. Wonderful.

727
01:20:07,109 --> 01:20:11,516
Meet the musical
little creatures...

728
01:20:11,589 --> 01:20:13,923
that hide in the flowers.

729
01:20:15,429 --> 01:20:16,803
Treat yourself.
