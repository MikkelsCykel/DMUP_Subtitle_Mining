2
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:46,969
Ah, little scoundrel.

3
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:51,271
There you are.
You are a bad boy.

4
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:55,247
Come on.
Hop on.

5
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,749
Like you always do.

6
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:12,361
Holy sacraments!
You'll kill yourself!

7
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:33,283
Only God knows how much
I loved you.

8
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,403
- Someone has died.
- Huh-uh.

9
00:02:56,442 --> 00:03:01,106
- It's Pentecost.
- No no, it must be a very big fish

10
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:04,241
if they are ringing
the cathedral bells.

11
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:08,282
Florentino, lay down.

12
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:12,147
Let's do it again.

13
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,285
Please?

14
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:17,990
Tolling like that must
be for a governor at least.

15
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,625
Or...

16
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,794
What?

17
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:27,930
What is it?

18
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:47,025
America, you must
go back to college.

19
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:51,291
My driver will take you.
There is something I have to do.

20
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:56,427
My deepest
sympathy.

21
00:03:57,604 --> 00:04:00,129
Your father
was a saint.

22
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:08,914
- My condolences.
- I'm so sorry.

23
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,679
We would still
have cholera

24
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:14,983
if it had not
been for him.

25
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:16,989
My sympathies,
Mrs. Urbino.

26
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:29,529
Let's go, Mom.

27
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:38,210
- See you all later, gentlemen.
- See you later.

28
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:41,145
Mama, I'll stay
if you want me to.

29
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:09,197
Fermina, I have waited

30
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:12,006
for this opportunity
for 51 years,

31
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:14,070
nine months
and four days.

32
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:19,576
That is how long
I have loved you,

33
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:22,213
from the first moment
I cast eyes on you until now.

34
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,591
I repeat
to you once again

35
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:30,528
my vow
of eternal fidelity

36
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:33,191
and everlasting love.

37
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,163
Florentino Ariza...

38
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:43,304
get out of here!

39
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:48,110
Get out!

40
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:53,541
And don't show your face again for
the years of life that are left to you.

41
00:05:57,056 --> 00:06:00,025
And I hope there are
very few of them.

42
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:32,450
Florentino Ariza!

43
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:39,886
Florentino!

44
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:43,953
Ah!

45
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:46,464
- That's not a telegram, Carlos.
- Come on, come on.

46
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:50,026
Deliver this, please,
to Senor Lorenzo Daza.

47
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:53,597
Old house,
Park of Evangels.

48
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:56,540
New in town,
a rough diamond.

49
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:59,977
Owns mules,
lots of mules.

50
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:02,105
Thank you, Lotario.

51
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:08,281
Thank you.

52
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:13,748
Yes yes, I'm coming.
I'm coming.

53
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:26,034
Last time you charged me
400 gold pesos,

54
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:29,269
that's double what I paid for this
whole abbey cloister... what?!

55
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:31,833
Senor Lorenzo Daza.

56
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:34,073
Yes.

57
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:41,482
Oh, good news.
Good news!

58
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,821
No reply.

59
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,826
Look at the shape
of the letter.

60
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,953
Not "U" but "A."

61
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:52,089
M-me...

62
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:55,931
M-m... me...

63
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:57,629
mis...

64
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:00,434
mist...

65
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:03,135
mistook...

66
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:05,541
Senor, Senor!

67
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:09,173
Tak... mistook...

68
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,809
mistake-taken...

69
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:13,842
Good.
Good.

70
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,547
Very good.

71
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,627
Mistook, mistake,

72
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:25,255
mistaken.

73
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:28,631
- What do you want?
- Look, I didn't do anything.

74
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:43,747
Don't you greet
your mother?

75
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:48,453
Florentino,
have you eaten?

76
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:50,580
Have you eaten?

77
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:00,455
"Fermina Daza,

78
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:02,262
for I have learned

79
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:05,930
that is your majestic

80
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:09,840
immortal name.

81
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:12,207
I write
this very short note

82
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:15,611
in order
to let you know...

83
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:19,449
that I love you."

84
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:21,919
- You haven't been to bed.
- Shh!

85
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,478
- Are you ill?
- No.

86
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:25,547
You are so pale, my son.
Are you sure?

87
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:28,116
- I'm not ill.
- Let me feel your head.

88
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,924
Let me feel your head.

89
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:33,796
What are you writing,
a book?

90
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,233
No, a letter.

91
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:40,102
All these pages,
and they're just one letter.

92
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,039
But what kind of a letter?

93
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:45,606
Holy Mother.

94
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:51,247
It is a love letter.

95
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:54,446
Oh, my son,
who is she?

96
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,081
Her name is...

97
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:00,892
Fermina Daza.

98
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:02,826
They're new in town.

99
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:05,592
Her mother is dead.
Her father owns mules.

100
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:09,897
And, Mama, I have discovered
the reason for my existence.

101
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:12,199
Don't talk such
nonsense, my son.

102
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:13,637
That's it!

103
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,834
Come on, come on,
come on.

104
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,866
But there is money in mules.

105
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:21,479
Does Fermina Daza
return your love?

106
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,141
"I've discovered..."

107
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,843
I don't know.
We haven't spoken.

108
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:26,852
That's why I'm writing
the letter.

109
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:29,320
If I can find the opportunity,
I'll give it to her,

110
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,255
but she's always
with her aunt.

111
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:35,283
Then you must
win over the aunt, not the girl.

112
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:43,625
It's him!
It is the telegram boy.

113
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:46,433
Walk on.

114
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,295
Eh-hh.

115
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:41,520
- Let me stand next to her.
- No!

116
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,800
Senorita Daza,

117
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:51,098
all I ask is that you accept
a letter from me.

118
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:53,128
- Not now.
- When?

119
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:55,333
Afterwards.

120
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:59,074
Corpus Christi.

121
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:03,076
- Corpus Christi.
- Amen.

122
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:26,333
Welcome, Fernando!

123
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:32,266
Papa, I'm going
to wish

124
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,745
Mother Superior
a happy Christmas.

125
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:42,888
This is the greatest moment
in my life.

126
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:44,651
Give it to me.

127
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:47,022
It was very long.
I made it shorter.

128
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:50,494
Wait!

129
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:52,588
It's a flower
of promising.

130
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:54,792
Go.

131
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:58,270
And don't see me again
until you hear from me.

132
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:30,964
My Holy Mother.
My Holy Mother.

133
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:33,301
It is cholera, my son.
It is cholera.

134
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:35,068
- No, Mama.
- My son!

135
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:38,167
I gave her the letter.

136
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,805
Now I must wait
for her reply.

137
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:47,444
Yeah.
Then enjoy your pain.

138
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:51,013
Take advantage of it now
while you are young.

139
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:54,548
And suffer, my son,
suffer all you can,

140
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:57,528
because these things don't
last your whole life.

141
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:02,523
May she answer soon.

142
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:06,404
She won't.

143
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,149
Florentino!

144
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:21,015
Florentino!

145
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:24,145
What the hell
you are doing?

146
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,991
It's not an American ship,
it's British.

147
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:30,928
It's the mail from Liverpool.
British.

148
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:35,030
Come here.

149
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:41,731
What is wrong with you?
This isn't love.

150
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,743
It's madness.
Give me, give me.

151
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:47,512
Up up up up.

152
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:51,047
No, wait wait.

153
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:56,053
Fly now, go.

154
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:01,583
What is wrong
with you?

155
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:10,365
You need to take
your mind off her.

156
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:12,427
Come with me
to the whorehouse if...

157
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:27,916
Yes?

158
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:30,387
Oh, how much is it
to send a telegram

159
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:31,980
to the village
of Piedras de Moler?

160
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:35,685
- Piedras de Moler?
- Uh-huh.

161
00:16:37,963 --> 00:16:40,295
Uh... let me see.

162
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:45,362
It's...
it's not on our list.

163
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:48,840
You don't... you don't
send telegrams to Piedras de Moler?

164
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,774
- No.
- Th... then...

165
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:59,346
good day to you.

166
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:07,447
Senorita!

167
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,742
"Dear Florentino Ariza...

168
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:27,473
I am sorry that I have

169
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:30,346
made you wait so long
for my reply.

170
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,782
I ask your forgiveness.

171
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:35,719
Please, write to me
again soon."

172
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:42,418
"Crowned goddess, I enclose

173
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:44,588
what I know is
a worthless memento.

174
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:48,396
I also write this verse
in honor of my love for you."

175
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:54,204
"I think of you every moment.

176
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:58,073
Now that spring is here,
thoughts of you fill me with life.

177
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:01,075
I will love you forever.

178
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:03,047
Forever."

179
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:48,393
Shh-hhh.

180
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:57,535
Shhh.

181
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:25,321
- It's him.
- Of course it's him.

182
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:31,834
- Senorita Escolastica?
- Shhh.

183
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:34,065
Senorita Escolastica,

184
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:38,042
please turn apart so I can talk
privately to the young lady.

185
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:40,544
I have something important
to ask her.

186
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:43,343
What impertinence!

187
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:46,180
There's nothing that has to do with her
that I cannot hear.

188
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:49,248
Then I will not
say anything.

189
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,017
But I warn you,

190
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:53,718
you will be responsible
for the consequences.

191
00:19:58,463 --> 00:20:01,626
- Fermina Daza.
- I am here.

192
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:03,692
We've written
too many letters

193
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:05,999
and too much time
has passed.

194
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:08,768
So now...

195
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:11,503
crowned goddess,

196
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,636
I make this vow.

197
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,671
I swear to you
my eternal fidelity

198
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,206
and everlasting love,

199
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:22,118
and I ask in all humility

200
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:26,284
to do me the great honor
of marrying me.

201
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,754
You...

202
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:32,889
you must give me time.

203
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:35,422
Fermina, say yes!

204
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:38,459
Fermina, I may not be married,
but I know about love.

205
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:40,061
Even if you're
dying of fear,

206
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:42,505
even if you are sorry later,
because whatever you do,

207
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:45,135
you will be sorry
all the rest of your life if you say no.

208
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:47,202
Believe me, I know
what I'm talking about.

209
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,421
Yes, very well.

210
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:02,757
I will marry you

211
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:05,194
if you... if you promise
not to make me eat

212
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,993
eggplant.

213
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:19,009
Who is he?
Who is he?

214
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:20,875
Who is he?

215
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:25,307
Who is this
Florentino Ariza?

216
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,045
Huh?

217
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:30,111
And Mother Superior
says that you write letters to him?

218
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:32,589
And you... you!

219
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:34,751
You are to blame.

220
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:52,907
No!

221
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:55,538
Aunt!

222
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,881
No!

223
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:08,916
No!

224
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:26,804
Daughter, daughter,
listen to your father.

225
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:29,405
Listen to your father.
Everything I do,

226
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:31,439
I do it because...

227
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:33,144
because I...

228
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,779
okay, I'll try.
I'll try, but...

229
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:39,313
but I have to... I have to ex...
I have to explain myself.

230
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:42,794
I have to explain myself.
It's difficult because I'm a plain man.

231
00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:48,623
But ever since
your mother died,

232
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:50,692
you've been...

233
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:52,863
you've been...

234
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:55,202
a daughter...
a daughter is a jewel.

235
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,209
Is a jewel. I'm...
I'm... I'm a rough diamond, but you're...

236
00:22:58,243 --> 00:23:01,610
you're...
you're the... the crown.

237
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:03,910
And I don't... I don't...
I don't work for me.

238
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:07,043
We didn't come here for me.
We came here for you.

239
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:09,212
For you!

240
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:11,415
But you don't know how...
just how beautiful you are.

241
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:13,117
You-you-you...
you're... you're...

242
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:16,685
you're much too beautiful
to marry a telegraph operator.

243
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:22,023
We have bigger fish to fry,
and believe me... believe me,

244
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:25,730
at your age,
love is an illusion.

245
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:31,899
Christ, by Christ I swear,

246
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:34,503
I swear,
I swear to Christ...

247
00:23:58,503 --> 00:24:00,562
Good morning,
good morning.

248
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:06,970
You and I must talk...
man to man.

249
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:15,310
Ahhhh.

250
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:18,811
When my wife died
I set myself one goal.

251
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:20,848
One goal...

252
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:23,861
to turn my daughter
into a great lady.

253
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:27,558
Now that's... that's a long road
to travel for a mule trader.

254
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:29,999
I've never had a drink
this early in the morning.

255
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:33,061
Better start now.
You're going to need it.

256
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:40,509
I came to this town
because...

257
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:43,343
well, here was the possibility
of a grand marriage.

258
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:46,282
Then an unforeseen
obstacle

259
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:49,185
to the plan that I have
fought for with my life...

260
00:24:50,188 --> 00:24:52,247
you.

261
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:56,220
So I've come to make
a polite request.

262
00:24:58,296 --> 00:25:00,287
Get out of our way.

263
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,493
Have you spoken to her?

264
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:04,832
None of that. None of that.
This is a matter for men

265
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:07,168
and it will be decided
by men.

266
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:11,040
Be that as it may,

267
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:14,102
I cannot answer without knowing
what she thinks.

268
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:17,813
Don't force me
to shoot you.

269
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:26,185
Shoot me.

270
00:25:26,224 --> 00:25:29,057
There is no greater glory
than to die for love.

271
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:33,631
Pack!

272
00:25:33,665 --> 00:25:36,225
- Where are we going?
- To our death!

273
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:38,634
You'd better explain.
I'm not leaving.

274
00:25:57,556 --> 00:26:00,024
Take it to him now.

275
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,097
- What is this?
- They leaving.

276
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:11,932
They going
to the country.

277
00:26:19,844 --> 00:26:22,813
- Hurry up!
- Where are you going?

278
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:24,508
He's taking me away.

279
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:25,607
- Sit down!
- Fermina.

280
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:27,948
Don't you dare
talk to him!

281
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:31,615
- Where are you talking her?
- He's taking me away!

282
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:34,056
Get out of our way.

283
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:35,889
Hyah!
Hyah!

284
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:41,392
Get back.
Get back.

285
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:47,160
¢Ü I think of you
every day ¢Ü

286
00:26:52,844 --> 00:26:56,974
¢Ü I think of you
a little bit more ¢Ü

287
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:07,023
¢Ü I tear my reason apart ¢Ü

288
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:16,700
¢Ü Something inside me
gets destroyed ¢Ü

289
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:21,938
C'mon, mule.

290
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:26,273
¢Ü I think of you
every day ¢Ü

291
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:36,080
¢Ü I think of you
a little bit more ¢Ü

292
00:27:41,192 --> 00:27:45,629
¢Ü And I keep
thinking of you ¢Ü

293
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:54,869
¢Ü And I keep
thinking. ¢Ü

294
00:27:59,978 --> 00:28:03,470
- That's bad. Five more.
- Take away all I have, right?

295
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:16,553
Aunt Fermina!

296
00:28:17,562 --> 00:28:19,257
Senora, may I help you?

297
00:28:19,297 --> 00:28:22,664
Hi, princess,
What are you here for?

298
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:29,937
Cousin Fermina?

299
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:33,610
I have a surprise for you.

300
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:49,958
Cousin.

301
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:10,404
He wants me to fix
a wedding date.

302
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:12,939
- Will you?
- Of course.

303
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:16,249
- Excuse me, Senoritas.
- Make it well into the future.

304
00:29:16,287 --> 00:29:20,485
Your father said he will
keep you here for a year at least.

305
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:23,324
A year is nothing.

306
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:26,554
We will exchange telegrams

307
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,930
as we used to exchange
letters.

308
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:32,360
And our love will triumph.

309
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:37,197
There is no man on Earth more
perfect than Florentino Ariza.

310
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:41,644
And you, Hildebranda,
are you in love?

311
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:49,046
A married man.

312
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:53,557
20 years older than me.

313
00:29:59,063 --> 00:30:01,531
Do you
exchange letters?

314
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:03,796
No.

315
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:06,804
Secret glances.

316
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:11,701
It all seems difficult
and impossible now,

317
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:16,180
but I just know that we must
learn to be happy without love.

318
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:18,409
And in spite of it.

319
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:20,576
Happy without love?

320
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:22,950
Yes.

321
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:25,947
Happy without love.

322
00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:30,390
I want to eat the tender flesh

323
00:30:30,428 --> 00:30:33,261
of every word
she has written to me

324
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:36,859
over and over.
I hope I survive.

325
00:30:36,901 --> 00:30:38,960
- But danger is everywhere.
- Fire!

326
00:30:40,438 --> 00:30:43,339
If the suffering of your own
heart doesn't kill you,

327
00:30:43,374 --> 00:30:47,174
the ever-recurring
civil war might.

328
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:49,339
And there is the disease

329
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:52,781
that comes between
the burst of bloodshed,

330
00:30:52,817 --> 00:30:55,843
the deadly choking embrace
of cholera.

331
00:30:55,887 --> 00:31:00,290
Dead collectors!
My daughter is...

332
00:31:00,325 --> 00:31:03,556
She is even more impossible
to predict than war.

333
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:05,563
She grabs hold,

334
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:08,065
then suddenly she lets go.

335
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:11,330
- Daddy! He's dead, too.
- She grabs hold,

336
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:13,234
she lets go.

337
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:22,711
Florentino!

338
00:31:22,747 --> 00:31:25,147
Up here!

339
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:44,725
Stop it, stop it.
It will be all three of you, I promise.

340
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:47,363
All in good time.

341
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:51,836
So which one
is it going to be?

342
00:31:51,876 --> 00:31:55,334
No no, my beloved
is returning soon.

343
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:58,372
I have to keep myself pure.

344
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,680
And I will only lose
my virginity for love.

345
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:02,913
Oooh.

346
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:06,321
That is such a bad idea.

347
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,259
Don't go, Florentino.

348
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:13,492
I will be back...
but not for some time.

349
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:16,830
Let's go, let's go.

350
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:41,521
So the worst years
of my life passed.

351
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:44,653
I counted the eternal minutes
one by one

352
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:46,630
as I waited for her return.

353
00:32:46,664 --> 00:32:48,928
But I do not mind.

354
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,993
I will keep watch
for all of eternity.

355
00:32:52,036 --> 00:32:55,597
I will keep watch
until I die if need be.

356
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:03,007
I stand vigil for her
beside the lighthouse.

357
00:33:03,047 --> 00:33:07,746
My heart is like the sea...
endless and everlasting,

358
00:33:07,785 --> 00:33:10,777
even while it is as turbulent
as the crashing waves.

359
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:14,420
Florentino, what are
you doing here?

360
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:17,986
Ricardo, the young lady I'm going
to marry is coming back tonight.

361
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:19,553
I'm waiting for her.

362
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:22,498
Come on.
Come on!

363
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:25,832
Ricardo the lighthouse keeper
is my only friend.

364
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:28,236
He does not understand.

365
00:33:28,272 --> 00:33:30,968
I must be here
to will her home.

366
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:45,914
I delegate to you the authority
to run this household...

367
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:50,153
and turn over to you
the keys to your life.

368
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:11,207
Crowned goddess, you are
the coming of the dawn.

369
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:14,741
Like spring, you have
returned to the one newborn.

370
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:32,297
Mom, Mom, there it is, Mom!
Yes, yes. Come on, come on.

371
00:34:32,336 --> 00:34:36,272
- That one, too? That one.
- No no, that one over there.

372
00:34:50,388 --> 00:34:52,083
Thank you.

373
00:34:54,459 --> 00:34:56,427
Coconut candy!

374
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,997
Sweets for your sweetie.

375
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,361
Coconut candy!

376
00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:09,598
The Arcade of Scribes is not
a place for a crowned goddess.

377
00:35:21,986 --> 00:35:24,045
No.

378
00:35:24,088 --> 00:35:26,852
No, please.

379
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:28,825
Forget it.

380
00:35:31,696 --> 00:35:33,994
Wh-wh-what do you mean
"forget it"?

381
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:38,792
I just...

382
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:41,066
I just realized

383
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:44,836
this... this moment
when I saw you.

384
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:46,070
What?

385
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:48,544
What did you realize?

386
00:35:51,516 --> 00:35:54,974
What is between us...

387
00:35:56,621 --> 00:35:59,283
is nothing more
than an illusion.

388
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:03,416
It... it clouded
my eyes.

389
00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:06,089
I'm so sorry.

390
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:13,364
You... you just...

391
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:15,395
realized it?

392
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:19,276
Yes.

393
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:24,146
The moment I saw you.

394
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:43,565
Make him well.

395
00:36:44,602 --> 00:36:47,298
Please.

396
00:36:57,381 --> 00:37:00,248
- Dr. Juvenal Urbino?
- He's a busy man.

397
00:37:00,284 --> 00:37:03,185
- This is urgent.
- No. Appointments only.

398
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:06,816
Cholera... my mistress
has cholera.

399
00:37:06,857 --> 00:37:09,553
No, you can't go up there.
You need to wear a mask.

400
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:17,728
I'm Hildebranda Sanchez,
the patient's cousin.

401
00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:20,259
She's upstairs.

402
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:27,573
I would like you to be present, please,
when I examine her.

403
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:29,705
Her father's with her.

404
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:34,814
Oh, thank you.
Thank you for coming.

405
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:36,615
I pray to God
you can do something.

406
00:37:36,654 --> 00:37:38,918
They say you know more
about cholera than a...

407
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:55,432
Under the tongue.

408
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:01,002
Vomiting?

409
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:03,013
How many times?
Once, twice?

410
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:04,674
Twice.

411
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:09,411
Diarrhea?

412
00:38:10,421 --> 00:38:12,821
- Severe?
- I don't...

413
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:14,449
- What?
- I... I don't know.

414
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:16,016
I've never had it before.

415
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:21,196
Sit up, please.

416
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:54,992
It is an intestinal
infection.

417
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:59,133
What?
It's not cholera?

418
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,001
No.
I'll prescribe medicine.

419
00:39:01,038 --> 00:39:04,439
Three days at home
and she'll be well again.

420
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:07,842
Did you hear that?
Oh.

421
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:12,041
Doctor, wait wait.

422
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:15,280
Doctor, wait! How did you learn
so much about cholera?

423
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:18,777
I, uh, studied in Paris
under Professor Proust.

424
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:21,519
All the things you've done
for the city... the clean water,

425
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:23,356
- closed sewage...
- Your daughter.

426
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:25,589
- Yes?
- She's very beautiful.

427
00:39:34,605 --> 00:39:36,903
Thank you.

428
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:54,587
Senorita.

429
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:57,593
I would like to, um...

430
00:39:57,628 --> 00:39:59,528
take your pulse.

431
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:15,342
Stick out
your tongue, please.

432
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:19,816
Mm-hmm.

433
00:40:22,486 --> 00:40:25,751
You are like a...
a new-sprung rose.

434
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:27,553
Thank you.

435
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,650
Do you like music?

436
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:31,490
What is the point
of that question?

437
00:40:31,529 --> 00:40:33,622
Music is important
for one's health.

438
00:40:39,403 --> 00:40:42,167
No! No, don't!
Doctor!

439
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:44,902
Do not go.
I saw it all.

440
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:46,671
I saw it all.

441
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:48,974
I... I told your daughter
that she is like a rose.

442
00:40:49,013 --> 00:40:51,174
True enough, but one
with too many thorns.

443
00:40:54,685 --> 00:40:57,620
Up up up!
You open that window and apologize.

444
00:40:57,655 --> 00:41:01,113
I have nothing to apologize for.
I closed the window to keep out the sun.

445
00:41:01,158 --> 00:41:03,149
Don't backtalk back to me, okay?
Do as I tell you.

446
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:11,263
Say something... now!

447
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:17,471
I offer you my most
heartfelt apology, sir.

448
00:41:21,178 --> 00:41:23,078
Her education.

449
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:35,951
Let me escort you
to the carriage.

450
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,364
Senor.

451
00:41:45,402 --> 00:41:48,030
I... I would like
your permission

452
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:50,006
to write
to your daughter.

453
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:54,572
Ahh.

454
00:41:58,415 --> 00:42:01,782
I will go and find her.
I won't let her go.

455
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:05,255
My destiny in life
is to love Fermina.

456
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:07,723
I will win her back.

457
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:14,096
Hildebranda, look!

458
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:18,398
Aye, beautiful!

459
00:42:18,435 --> 00:42:20,460
Mmmmm,
another one.

460
00:42:20,504 --> 00:42:22,972
Gala Placidia, I told you
not to accept it.

461
00:42:23,007 --> 00:42:25,407
Oh, I know that,
milady,

462
00:42:25,442 --> 00:42:29,037
but is hard to say
no to Dr. Urbino.

463
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:30,876
How many is that now?

464
00:42:30,915 --> 00:42:32,507
Seven.

465
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:36,042
- You must reply.
- We're not going to discuss it.

466
00:42:36,086 --> 00:42:37,815
We must hurry.

467
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:40,722
The Belgian photographer
is expecting us.

468
00:42:40,758 --> 00:42:42,851
Gala Placidia,
help us to dress.

469
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:45,862
Oh, yes, milady,
it is perfect.

470
00:42:56,173 --> 00:42:58,141
Ladies, very still.

471
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:03,244
I will count
to five now.

472
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:07,717
One, two, three...

473
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:10,686
four, five.

474
00:43:17,027 --> 00:43:19,860
One, two, three!

475
00:43:20,898 --> 00:43:22,923
Benny Centeno!

476
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:38,214
Benny, Benny, Benny...

477
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,822
Move aside!
Move aside!

478
00:43:52,863 --> 00:43:55,263
Benny!
Champion!

479
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:57,426
Please get in, I'll take you
wherever you want to go.

480
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:59,299
Benny, Benny, Benny!

481
00:44:20,357 --> 00:44:22,723
Who is Benny Centeno?

482
00:44:24,094 --> 00:44:27,689
He just won the boxing
championship in Panama.

483
00:44:27,731 --> 00:44:29,028
Oh.

484
00:44:29,066 --> 00:44:31,500
This is so nice.

485
00:44:31,535 --> 00:44:34,163
I could spend the rest
of my life here.

486
00:44:38,976 --> 00:44:41,968
Oh, ay, my boots
are killing me.

487
00:44:44,148 --> 00:44:46,639
I'll have to take them off.

488
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,311
I'll take off mine too.

489
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:50,047
Let's see who
finishes first.

490
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:56,052
Oh!

491
00:44:56,093 --> 00:44:57,685
Mmm.

492
00:44:57,728 --> 00:44:59,958
You won.
You won.

493
00:45:02,666 --> 00:45:05,396
But now I realize it
wasn't my boots at all.

494
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:09,503
It is this wire cage
under my skirt.

495
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,168
Hmm, nothing could
be simpler.

496
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:14,439
Take it off.

497
00:45:15,512 --> 00:45:17,742
I won't look.

498
00:45:20,417 --> 00:45:21,907
Ay!

499
00:45:23,821 --> 00:45:25,846
I am waiting.

500
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:27,550
We want to go home.

501
00:45:35,966 --> 00:45:37,957
Whoa whoa whoa.

502
00:45:42,606 --> 00:45:46,440
Read my letters.
I want your answer.

503
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:59,612
He's very beautiful.

504
00:45:59,656 --> 00:46:04,116
When he covered his eyes
and I saw his perfect teeth

505
00:46:04,161 --> 00:46:07,494
between those rosy lips,
I wanted...

506
00:46:07,531 --> 00:46:09,795
oooh, eeeoh.

507
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:16,429
I wanted to devour him
with kisses.

508
00:46:17,508 --> 00:46:20,033
What a whore you are.

509
00:46:40,764 --> 00:46:42,891
"Dear Senor Urbino,

510
00:46:42,933 --> 00:46:45,959
I give you my permission

511
00:46:46,003 --> 00:46:47,994
to speak to my father."

512
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:28,034
Senora.

513
00:47:28,078 --> 00:47:31,775
Forgive me for keeping
you waiting, Transito,

514
00:47:31,815 --> 00:47:33,908
but I have to practice
my singing.

515
00:47:33,951 --> 00:47:36,613
You never know when there's
going to be a funeral, eh?

516
00:47:36,653 --> 00:47:38,553
But, please please.

517
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:43,350
So...

518
00:47:43,393 --> 00:47:45,918
is there a problem?

519
00:47:45,963 --> 00:47:48,431
You get the money
I send each month?

520
00:47:48,465 --> 00:47:51,457
Thank you.
You are a kind man, Don Leo.

521
00:47:51,501 --> 00:47:53,765
I am not kind.
I am just,

522
00:47:53,804 --> 00:47:57,001
unlike my brother Pius.
Something had to be done.

523
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,498
Pius should have made
a proper provision for my son.

524
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:02,944
Well, he did not
and I did.

525
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:04,811
So?

526
00:48:04,848 --> 00:48:07,339
I've come...

527
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:10,285
to ask if
you can help him.

528
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,117
- Who?
- Your nephew.

529
00:48:12,155 --> 00:48:13,645
My son Florentino.

530
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:16,215
What kind of help?

531
00:48:18,695 --> 00:48:20,458
A job.

532
00:48:20,497 --> 00:48:22,692
Well, I thought he had a job
at the telegraph office.

533
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:25,497
Yes, but I'm asking you
to find him another job...

534
00:48:25,535 --> 00:48:28,299
any job, as long as
it's far away.

535
00:48:28,338 --> 00:48:30,772
Some port lost
in the jungle where...

536
00:48:30,807 --> 00:48:33,537
where there is no mail,
no telegraph.

537
00:48:35,946 --> 00:48:38,244
A broken heart.

538
00:48:38,282 --> 00:48:39,806
Yeah.

539
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,157
Hmm.

540
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:02,770
Hmmm.
How about Villa de Leyva?

541
00:49:02,806 --> 00:49:04,637
How far away is that?

542
00:49:06,043 --> 00:49:07,943
Oh...

543
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:13,606
about three weeks.

544
00:49:19,189 --> 00:49:21,350
I am nothing.

545
00:49:21,391 --> 00:49:23,791
I will not heal...

546
00:49:23,827 --> 00:49:26,352
not for all time.

547
00:49:26,396 --> 00:49:29,661
I'm struck by
the lightning of love

548
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,861
and burned beyond repair.

549
00:49:33,904 --> 00:49:36,464
She's a splinter that
cannot be pulled out.

550
00:49:36,506 --> 00:49:39,600
She's part of me,
everywhere I go.

551
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:41,736
Everywhere, she is.

552
00:49:51,888 --> 00:49:56,052
- Hello.
- Fermina.

553
00:50:11,908 --> 00:50:13,933
What are you doing?

554
00:50:15,278 --> 00:50:17,405
Turn off the light.

555
00:50:30,293 --> 00:50:32,261
I want...

556
00:50:32,295 --> 00:50:34,388
absolute darkness.

557
00:50:36,066 --> 00:50:38,330
You forget, Doctor,
this is the first time

558
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:40,097
I've slept
with a stranger.

559
00:50:46,843 --> 00:50:49,209
Do you love me?

560
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:51,840
Don't be frightened.

561
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:55,283
We are man and wife.

562
00:50:55,318 --> 00:50:57,548
I want you to love every...

563
00:50:57,587 --> 00:50:59,452
every moment
of our honeymoon.

564
00:51:01,792 --> 00:51:04,090
I can't wait
to show you Paris.

565
00:51:04,127 --> 00:51:06,357
It is a...

566
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:08,796
a city of love.

567
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:16,000
You have

568
00:51:16,039 --> 00:51:18,940
a beautiful smile.

569
00:51:18,975 --> 00:51:21,341
Thank you.

570
00:51:23,013 --> 00:51:25,106
I think my sense of smell

571
00:51:25,148 --> 00:51:27,878
is overdeveloped.

572
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:30,284
Well, that would be because
your olfactory organ's...

573
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:32,379
I'm sorry
I mentioned it.

574
00:51:44,134 --> 00:51:46,329
Shhh.

575
00:51:48,205 --> 00:51:50,173
Don't forget I have
met them before.

576
00:51:50,207 --> 00:51:52,732
I remember it
very well.

577
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:55,574
And I'm still angry.

578
00:52:17,367 --> 00:52:20,928
I've... I've never been able to
understand how your thing works.

579
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:27,739
How ugly it is.

580
00:52:30,714 --> 00:52:34,150
Even uglier than
a woman's thing.

581
00:52:34,184 --> 00:52:36,652
Yes.

582
00:52:36,686 --> 00:52:38,984
Besides, I think it has...

583
00:52:39,022 --> 00:52:41,149
too many bits on it.

584
00:52:41,191 --> 00:52:43,250
That's astounding.

585
00:52:43,293 --> 00:52:46,160
My doctoral thesis was
on the advantage...

586
00:52:46,196 --> 00:52:49,427
I don't want
a medical lesson.

587
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,866
No. No.

588
00:52:52,903 --> 00:52:56,031
This is going to be
a lesson in love.

589
00:53:15,292 --> 00:53:17,021
The black flag!

590
00:53:19,429 --> 00:53:22,193
That's the plague flag.
Give them a wide berth.

591
00:53:24,134 --> 00:53:26,602
Please, help us!

592
00:53:26,636 --> 00:53:29,161
Captain!

593
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:32,471
- They're dying of cholera!
- Cholera!

594
00:53:32,509 --> 00:53:35,444
Please!

595
00:53:35,478 --> 00:53:37,571
Good Heavens! Careful,
don't get too close...

596
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:40,543
Please, help us!

597
00:53:40,617 --> 00:53:43,552
Captain! Help us!

598
00:53:44,955 --> 00:53:46,286
Cholera!

599
00:53:46,323 --> 00:53:50,657
Help me! Please.

600
00:53:50,694 --> 00:53:51,888
Don't leave.

601
00:53:51,928 --> 00:53:54,158
God! What's that?

602
00:53:54,197 --> 00:53:56,995
Help me! Please!

603
00:54:02,172 --> 00:54:05,608
Keep her safe, protect her
from harm.

604
00:54:07,644 --> 00:54:10,112
Good night,
my crowned goddess.

605
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:01,260
Go go.
Go on and forget all about it.

606
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:03,129
This never happened.

607
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:27,916
Who occupies that cabin...
the middle one?

608
00:55:27,957 --> 00:55:30,517
- Three women.
- Three women?

609
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:34,758
They have three cabins
and they both connect together.

610
00:55:34,798 --> 00:55:37,062
It makes one big one.

611
00:55:39,069 --> 00:55:42,266
- Who are they, these women?
- I don't know.

612
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,208
- You go on.
- We'll see.

613
00:56:05,061 --> 00:56:08,189
- See her eyes?
- My, Rosalba.

614
00:56:08,231 --> 00:56:10,392
He looks very sweet.

615
00:56:10,433 --> 00:56:12,424
And so shy.

616
00:56:12,469 --> 00:56:14,630
It's the shy ones
you must look out for.

617
00:57:07,457 --> 00:57:11,120
- Carefully, it's fragile.
- Get out of the way.

618
00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:29,404
He's staring at you.

619
00:57:32,081 --> 00:57:33,776
Bye!

620
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:09,084
Fermina, my vow...

621
00:58:09,118 --> 00:58:12,519
I've broken my vow.

622
00:58:26,636 --> 00:58:29,230
You shouldn't have
come back, my son.

623
00:58:29,272 --> 00:58:31,536
I had to.

624
00:58:31,574 --> 00:58:33,667
Why?

625
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:35,701
Something happened and...

626
00:58:35,745 --> 00:58:38,646
I had to be near
Fermina again, Mama.

627
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:41,775
- That's all.
- But she's not here.

628
00:58:45,088 --> 00:58:47,648
What do you mean
she's not here?

629
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:51,353
She's in Paris
on her honeymoon.

630
00:58:51,394 --> 00:58:54,727
She'll be gone a long time...
more than one year.

631
00:58:56,332 --> 00:58:59,631
Maybe two years.

632
00:58:59,669 --> 00:59:02,263
- That's not true, Mama.
- It is true, my son.

633
00:59:02,305 --> 00:59:04,569
- No.
- It is true.

634
00:59:04,607 --> 00:59:06,837
At least two years.

635
00:59:12,315 --> 00:59:15,250
- No.
- No, Mama.

636
00:59:15,285 --> 00:59:17,549
Please don't cry.

637
00:59:17,587 --> 00:59:19,521
Oh.

638
00:59:21,991 --> 00:59:24,824
Please...
please don't waste your life.

639
00:59:26,262 --> 00:59:28,196
You must forget her.

640
00:59:30,099 --> 00:59:33,591
You must find someone else
who will help you forget.

641
00:59:33,636 --> 00:59:36,230
I can't forget, Mama.

642
00:59:36,272 --> 00:59:39,901
I will
never forget, Mama.

643
00:59:39,943 --> 00:59:42,309
I will never forget, Mama.

644
00:59:48,851 --> 00:59:52,218
Senora, senora!
Be careful! Senora!

645
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:55,156
- Senora.
- Come on, boys.

646
01:00:05,401 --> 01:00:08,165
Open fire!

647
01:00:10,673 --> 01:00:13,369
They destroyed my house,
Transito!

648
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:16,139
They destroyed my house.

649
01:00:16,179 --> 01:00:17,806
Come in.

650
01:00:17,847 --> 01:00:20,748
I need a bed...

651
01:00:20,783 --> 01:00:22,842
on the floor, anywhere.

652
01:00:22,885 --> 01:00:25,547
Just until I can
rebuild my house.

653
01:00:27,390 --> 01:00:30,382
Who knows how long
this war will last.

654
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:34,691
Come on, drink.

655
01:00:43,172 --> 01:00:45,106
You must stay here.

656
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:47,939
- So you have the room?
- No.

657
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:50,571
It is a shame.
My own bedroom is too small.

658
01:00:50,613 --> 01:00:53,275
But if you don't mind...

659
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:56,080
sharing with my son.

660
01:01:02,692 --> 01:01:04,353
Florentino?

661
01:01:04,394 --> 01:01:06,259
An emergency.

662
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:11,125
The Widow Nazaret,
her house has been damaged.

663
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:14,193
War has no respect
for anybody.

664
01:01:14,237 --> 01:01:17,536
She needs a bed.
You can sleep in your hammock.

665
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:26,639
I'm so scared!

666
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:29,208
If it wasn't enough
to lose my husband,

667
01:01:29,252 --> 01:01:32,710
now this.

668
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:39,525
He died three years ago.

669
01:01:51,474 --> 01:01:53,101
Help me, help me.

670
01:01:53,142 --> 01:01:55,667
My dead husband
always undid my laces.

671
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:57,737
Help me, please.

672
01:01:57,780 --> 01:02:00,214
Help me.

673
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:06,379
I've never been
in the same bed

674
01:02:06,422 --> 01:02:09,016
with any other man...

675
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:12,391
ay... other than
my dead husband.

676
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:17,957
He's in his coffin now

677
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,025
under the ground.

678
01:02:21,537 --> 01:02:23,505
I'm so happy!

679
01:02:23,539 --> 01:02:26,906
I'm happy
because only now

680
01:02:26,943 --> 01:02:28,535
do I know for certain

681
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:30,045
where he is

682
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:32,104
when he's not at...

683
01:02:32,148 --> 01:02:34,412
home!

684
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:49,425
Women.

685
01:02:55,905 --> 01:02:57,873
Number one...

686
01:03:00,643 --> 01:03:03,476
unknown lady in boat.

687
01:03:06,382 --> 01:03:08,577
The first...

688
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:10,586
wondrous...

689
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:14,817
explosion.

690
01:03:16,893 --> 01:03:19,487
Number two...

691
01:03:19,529 --> 01:03:21,588
the Widow Nazaret...

692
01:03:26,135 --> 01:03:28,763
while doing it,

693
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:30,773
only talks of
her dead husband.

694
01:03:33,242 --> 01:03:34,903
Number three...

695
01:03:37,346 --> 01:03:39,678
Esmeralda Arau...

696
01:03:39,715 --> 01:03:41,239
a skinny,
wiggling tadpole

697
01:03:41,284 --> 01:03:42,945
who'd walk me
through the ferns.

698
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:48,650
Number four...

699
01:03:48,691 --> 01:03:50,556
Maria Estevez...

700
01:03:50,593 --> 01:03:52,618
very dangerous.

701
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:54,459
We were so close
to the street,

702
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:56,397
anyone could
have heard us.

703
01:03:59,068 --> 01:04:01,093
This is the cure
for the pain

704
01:04:01,137 --> 01:04:02,764
of Fermina.

705
01:04:10,813 --> 01:04:12,576
What is it?

706
01:04:15,084 --> 01:04:17,609
Nothing, my son, nothing.

707
01:04:19,422 --> 01:04:21,322
- For a moment I...
- What?

708
01:04:22,325 --> 01:04:24,225
I didn't know
who you were.

709
01:04:25,561 --> 01:04:27,324
It happens to me
more and more,

710
01:04:27,363 --> 01:04:29,194
but it... it goes.

711
01:04:29,232 --> 01:04:31,359
Give me your hand.
Give me your hand.

712
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:33,197
Ma... I have work
to do, Mama.

713
01:04:34,604 --> 01:04:38,404
Work? What work?
You need to find a job and to get paid.

714
01:04:38,441 --> 01:04:40,534
I can't keep you forever.

715
01:04:41,611 --> 01:04:43,738
I... I... I have
something to tell you.

716
01:04:43,779 --> 01:04:46,009
You are going
to marry the widow.

717
01:04:46,048 --> 01:04:47,572
Oh, no.

718
01:04:47,617 --> 01:04:50,108
- What did you say?
- Ma... Mama...

719
01:04:50,152 --> 01:04:52,848
Did you say you had
something to tell me?

720
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:56,325
Yes, I honestly believe...

721
01:04:56,359 --> 01:04:58,657
I'm getting over the worst.

722
01:05:00,396 --> 01:05:01,988
What was her name again?

723
01:05:02,031 --> 01:05:04,499
Fermina.
Fermina.

724
01:05:04,533 --> 01:05:06,831
Fermina.

725
01:05:06,869 --> 01:05:08,496
I begin to feel free.

726
01:05:08,537 --> 01:05:11,005
The pain is gone.
It's gone.

727
01:05:19,715 --> 01:05:22,309
Now, it took Paris,
the city of love, to bring about

728
01:05:22,351 --> 01:05:24,911
this blessed
transformation.

729
01:05:24,954 --> 01:05:28,014
But here we are
amongst our dearest friends.

730
01:05:28,057 --> 01:05:30,821
We are happier than
you can know to be here.

731
01:05:32,361 --> 01:05:35,694
And furthermore,
we are overjoyed

732
01:05:35,731 --> 01:05:38,325
to no longer
be two, but three.

733
01:05:42,338 --> 01:05:45,933
The great purpose
of marriage has made itself clear to all

734
01:05:45,975 --> 01:05:48,671
and we thank you,
our dear friends, for your warmth

735
01:05:48,711 --> 01:05:50,872
and your congratulations.

736
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:20,566
Well, I was wondering
how long it would be

737
01:06:20,609 --> 01:06:22,372
before you came begging me.

738
01:06:22,411 --> 01:06:24,709
- What do you want?
- A job.

739
01:06:24,747 --> 01:06:26,044
I gave you a job...

740
01:06:26,082 --> 01:06:27,913
at Villa de Leyva
and you threw it away.

741
01:06:27,950 --> 01:06:29,542
It is different now.

742
01:06:29,585 --> 01:06:32,110
I want to be
rich like you.

743
01:06:32,154 --> 01:06:33,678
I am not rich.

744
01:06:33,723 --> 01:06:35,384
I'm a poor man with money

745
01:06:35,424 --> 01:06:37,051
which is not the same thing.

746
01:06:40,763 --> 01:06:43,459
Why do you
want to be rich?

747
01:06:43,499 --> 01:06:45,091
So that I can be
someone in society,

748
01:06:45,134 --> 01:06:49,036
I need... I need to be worthy
of a great lady I cannot stop loving.

749
01:06:50,072 --> 01:06:51,596
Who is she?

750
01:06:53,075 --> 01:06:54,940
Married?

751
01:06:54,977 --> 01:06:56,877
Yes, but I'm waiting
for her husband to die.

752
01:06:56,912 --> 01:06:58,038
Is he old?

753
01:06:58,080 --> 01:06:59,707
No, but I'll wait
for however long it takes.

754
01:06:59,749 --> 01:07:01,273
- You're crazy.
- Why?

755
01:07:01,317 --> 01:07:02,841
Because insanity
runs in the family.

756
01:07:02,885 --> 01:07:04,546
You take after
your father.

757
01:07:04,587 --> 01:07:07,078
You never knew him,
my brother Pius.

758
01:07:09,458 --> 01:07:11,892
You know what
his last words were?

759
01:07:11,927 --> 01:07:15,419
He said "The only regret I have
in dying is that I do not die for love."

760
01:07:19,068 --> 01:07:20,865
He said that?

761
01:07:20,903 --> 01:07:23,337
- He really said that?
- On his deathbed.

762
01:07:23,372 --> 01:07:26,034
Nevertheless, all his life he fucked
everything in sight.

763
01:07:28,511 --> 01:07:30,843
So...

764
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:33,610
you want a job in the River
Company of the Caribbean.

765
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:36,945
Yes, yes.

766
01:07:36,986 --> 01:07:39,181
Well, are you any good

767
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:41,018
at, um, writing letters?

768
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:42,922
I think so, I...

769
01:07:42,958 --> 01:07:44,653
I... I write poetry, too

770
01:07:44,693 --> 01:07:47,161
I enter a poem every year
in the Poetic Festival.

771
01:07:47,196 --> 01:07:49,528
I have never won, but...

772
01:07:49,565 --> 01:07:51,897
So, you have a way
with words, huh?

773
01:07:51,934 --> 01:07:53,697
- Yes.
- Good.

774
01:07:53,736 --> 01:07:55,795
Perhaps you can tell me

775
01:07:55,838 --> 01:07:57,567
what this means.

776
01:07:57,606 --> 01:07:59,096
On my birthday last year

777
01:07:59,141 --> 01:08:01,006
someone made
a speech in my honor.

778
01:08:01,043 --> 01:08:04,479
He said I suffered
from lucid dementia.

779
01:08:04,513 --> 01:08:06,003
Now what does that mean?

780
01:08:06,048 --> 01:08:09,074
Lucid dementia
means you are clearly crazy.

781
01:08:20,663 --> 01:08:22,722
I told you it
ran in the family.

782
01:08:26,202 --> 01:08:29,603
Start tomorrow.
Clerk to the board of directors.

783
01:08:30,906 --> 01:08:33,238
Tamales! Tamales!

784
01:08:33,275 --> 01:08:35,607
Magic inks.

785
01:08:35,644 --> 01:08:37,703
Very light blow.

786
01:08:37,746 --> 01:08:41,147
Invisible ink
for your secret letter.
