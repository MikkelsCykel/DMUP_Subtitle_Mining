2
00:01:04,405 --> 00:01:05,781
Miss Rahm?

3
00:01:18,169 --> 00:01:22,589
Thus, it is enough for today.
Mr. Rauch is visited.

4
00:01:41,317 --> 00:01:43,110
Armand Rauch?

5
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:51,618
I am Sophia Rahme
my mother was Famke Rahm.

6
00:01:52,578 --> 00:01:55,872
Her sister has
studied in Argentina.

7
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:01,002
I think I'm your cousin.

8
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:02,838
Cousin?

9
00:02:04,841 --> 00:02:09,594
My girl,
you still need to see.

10
00:02:13,516 --> 00:02:17,894
Tell me
how you found me.

11
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:26,236
It was not easy.
But now I'm here, Uncle.

12
00:02:26,863 --> 00:02:31,783
Or should I say, General? Thus,
nevertheless, Neurath General of the SS?

13
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:37,664
I called Rauch.
Armand Rauch.

14
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:44,337
Do you remember Mathieu Jonas?
You were glad when he died down.

15
00:02:44,881 --> 00:02:47,299
But he had a daughter.

16
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:53,346
This was my mother.

17
00:02:55,558 --> 00:03:00,020
And this was my father.

18
00:03:01,689 --> 00:03:06,067
And this soldier of them
liberated from the concentration camp.

19
00:03:07,278 --> 00:03:09,863
I saw them die while
to you and the others were looking for.

20
00:03:09,947 --> 00:03:14,159
Each time you feel pain,
for them.

21
00:03:14,243 --> 00:03:16,786
Jewish bitch, whore.

22
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:21,541
There is a reason
for you not to die.

23
00:03:21,626 --> 00:03:24,169
Liver Klaus Listener to me.

24
00:03:24,754 --> 00:03:29,841
If you give me Klaus Listener, I will
not suffocate with a pillow.

25
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:33,803
What a nerve.

26
00:03:34,555 --> 00:03:38,350
Still shaking your hands.

27
00:03:39,268 --> 00:03:40,810
I am helpless.

28
00:03:42,772 --> 00:03:44,356
Do it.

29
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:54,658
Typical.

30
00:03:55,451 --> 00:03:59,829
You know, there is a reason
why all this started.

31
00:03:59,914 --> 00:04:02,874
And now when I look at you as...

32
00:04:03,084 --> 00:04:08,421
I remember what it was.

33
00:04:13,803 --> 00:04:18,682
Well, but you are too proud to
not something to have withheld.

34
00:04:19,141 --> 00:04:20,725
Souvenirs?

35
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:51,298
Even if you find Klaus Ontario,
that nothing will change.

36
00:04:52,508 --> 00:04:55,844
You're too late.

37
00:04:58,014 --> 00:05:03,435
You do not know, eh?
-- What do you mean?

38
00:05:04,228 --> 00:05:08,064
Hunt Who is this?
Is he a scientist?

39
00:05:08,149 --> 00:05:12,068
Why do you finance his work in Europe?
Is Klaus Ener there?

40
00:05:12,153 --> 00:05:14,279
Answer the question.

41
00:05:14,405 --> 00:05:19,576
Do you still see yourself,
a child who plays detective.

42
00:05:20,328 --> 00:05:25,874
The Millennial Kingdom hides
really not for people like you.

43
00:05:26,167 --> 00:05:29,669
It is simply lurking
in the shade.

44
00:05:35,509 --> 00:05:39,179
Damn.
Come on, quietly.

45
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:43,224
Do not you dare to die.

46
00:05:58,032 --> 00:05:59,282
Damn.

47
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:51,126
Doctor?

48
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:56,256
They arrived.
We have them in sight.

49
00:06:57,967 --> 00:06:59,718
Herr Klaus Listener?

50
00:07:15,484 --> 00:07:17,193
EASTERN EUROPE

51
00:07:17,278 --> 00:07:19,320
Control unit, secure the location.

52
00:07:20,322 --> 00:07:22,574
The assault team is leading.

53
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:52,270
There are cartridge cases
and fresh blood.

54
00:07:52,354 --> 00:07:55,690
No sign of the searched or his team.

55
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:04,783
We are now approaching the machine room.

56
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:08,870
We see the engine room.

57
00:08:31,852 --> 00:08:35,733
We need them out of there.
-- It is too late, Josef.

58
00:08:40,903 --> 00:08:42,445
But the command is executed.

59
00:08:47,034 --> 00:08:52,372
Be happy Josef.
This is the beginning.

60
00:10:45,569 --> 00:10:48,738
I'm sorry,
I speak the language.

61
00:10:53,661 --> 00:10:55,203
Give me a break.

62
00:11:07,841 --> 00:11:10,259
I have money, take that...

63
00:11:11,261 --> 00:11:14,764
Enough.
Let her, Marius.

64
00:11:35,619 --> 00:11:38,413
Are you a journalist?
-- No.

65
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:44,210
Women now have not come here.
-- I am looking for this man.

66
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:48,047
He was here a week or two back
have been.

67
00:11:49,091 --> 00:11:50,717
Yes, he was here.

68
00:11:51,135 --> 00:11:54,220
He said some soldiers,
who were not from here.

69
00:11:54,304 --> 00:11:58,725
They went to the east.
-- To the east, so?

70
00:11:58,809 --> 00:12:03,146
Since you really can not go.
Do you see the families out there?

71
00:12:03,897 --> 00:12:07,692
They come from there. Their houses are
burned, their families killed.

72
00:12:08,277 --> 00:12:11,404
They talk about horrible things.

73
00:12:11,488 --> 00:12:14,240
Can Hunt via a different route
come back?

74
00:12:14,324 --> 00:12:17,326
He has not come back.
He's dead.

75
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,877
You look old.
-- Thank you.

76
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:31,799
Now you're here, I'd like a whiskey.
-- Two double.

77
00:12:33,177 --> 00:12:34,927
He pays.

78
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:42,268
Boy, she's grown.
-- It is long ago.

79
00:12:43,145 --> 00:12:47,774
And a lot has happened.
Where have you been?

80
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:50,151
Everywhere and nowhere.

81
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:55,406
I heard about Mathieu.
Horrible.

82
00:12:57,201 --> 00:13:01,829
A car accident, right?
-- Yes, it was an accident.

83
00:13:01,997 --> 00:13:04,791
That explains why Neurath
not lived long enough...

84
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:08,920
Paraguay to stand trial.
-- That was an accident.

85
00:13:09,004 --> 00:13:14,175
He supplied from Hunt, and now you're
here looking for Klaus Ontario, eh?

86
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:17,261
I'm on the right track.
Hunt is just like you.

87
00:13:17,888 --> 00:13:21,599
Looking for those weird magnets.
-- The unified field theory.

88
00:13:21,683 --> 00:13:24,644
Whatever.
-- Yes, he worked on the same.

89
00:13:24,728 --> 00:13:28,815
And you want not. Go home.
-- Absolutely not.

90
00:13:28,899 --> 00:13:33,653
Lena, have you ever listened to him?
This is real.

91
00:13:33,737 --> 00:13:37,240
This goes to the prize.
-- Geez.

92
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:44,080
Take a look.

93
00:13:48,085 --> 00:13:52,296
A reaction of NATO fighting
here in secret for two weeks.

94
00:14:57,321 --> 00:14:58,654
Mama?

95
00:14:59,615 --> 00:15:01,157
Still...

96
00:15:18,175 --> 00:15:21,510
A couple of guys dressed as...
-- You do not understand.

97
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:27,808
Götz, camp commander.
That bastard died in 1945.

98
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:37,360
He looks lively for a corpse.

99
00:15:42,324 --> 00:15:45,826
Klaus has Listener that?
Really?

100
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:50,206
It's not about old men
retirement homes, Lena.

101
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:54,293
You know where he is.
-- Go home.

102
00:15:54,378 --> 00:15:56,462
Forget it.
-- I've tried.

103
00:15:56,546 --> 00:15:59,799
Take me.
-- That I will not do.

104
00:15:59,967 --> 00:16:02,510
Klaus Ontario is the last. I
grabbed him and for me it's over.

105
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:07,265
Good luck.
It was nice to see you.

106
00:16:16,024 --> 00:16:17,108
So...

107
00:16:20,487 --> 00:16:25,533
How is the Listener Klaus succeeded?
They look like ghosts.

108
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:30,079
That sounds romantic but so far
of reality is not.

109
00:16:30,163 --> 00:16:35,710
Looky Klaus Listener's machine. This
you have the perfect army behind you.

110
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:39,297
He would force a special
treatment have given.

111
00:16:39,381 --> 00:16:40,423
Nice.

112
00:16:40,507 --> 00:16:45,094
A treatment in combination with
the magnetic field of the machine.

113
00:16:45,178 --> 00:16:48,639
Suddenly the men are not like us.

114
00:16:48,724 --> 00:16:52,893
Within the magnetic field, they do
what they want, bullets do nothing.

115
00:16:53,687 --> 00:16:56,439
This is three weeks reversed.

116
00:16:57,024 --> 00:17:00,443
Nothing unusual,
though it is a civil war.

117
00:17:00,527 --> 00:17:03,404
This is two weeks old
made after Hunt disappeared.

118
00:17:03,488 --> 00:17:06,532
This area
is an electromagnetic field.

119
00:17:06,616 --> 00:17:09,076
Vehicles, communications,
aircraft...

120
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:11,287
...anything with electronics
in it does nothing.

121
00:17:11,371 --> 00:17:16,083
It is exactly what Klaus Listener
was last stationed.

122
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,128
This is from three days ago.

123
00:17:19,296 --> 00:17:22,465
Now that it has a cross
-- section of 50 kilometers.

124
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:25,509
Götz and his men extend it.

125
00:17:25,969 --> 00:17:30,848
Where do they go? -- Everywhere,
that is what they want.

126
00:17:32,059 --> 00:17:34,518
The Millennial Kingdom...

127
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:43,194
Right. Here we go.

128
00:17:46,907 --> 00:17:48,949
Come on, let's go.

129
00:17:49,534 --> 00:17:52,578
What is going on? -- We have
a task force of the UN.

130
00:17:52,662 --> 00:17:56,082
We believe that chemical
weapons are used.

131
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:58,042
The population may have...

132
00:17:58,126 --> 00:18:01,712
this area for a short time left
because of their safety.

133
00:18:03,632 --> 00:18:04,673
Clear.

134
00:18:06,009 --> 00:18:08,427
We gotta go.
-- Chemical weapons?

135
00:18:08,553 --> 00:18:12,264
Bullshit. Why such a big
disclose secret...

136
00:18:12,349 --> 00:18:14,975
if you steal it for yourself?
-- They do not.

137
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,520
Many governments will
everything for free...

138
00:18:17,604 --> 00:18:20,940
Klaus to Ontario or the machine
access. We must go now.

139
00:18:21,024 --> 00:18:25,486
What would you do? The yield
donate to charity?

140
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:30,324
I have searched in Russia Klaus Listener,
and trusted the wrong people.

141
00:18:33,703 --> 00:18:38,416
Make sure you're not in jail
comes. It's cold.

142
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:42,336
After one year there were
suddenly two men of the embassy.

143
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:44,922
I thought that get me out of here.

144
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:48,717
But when they noticed I knew
nothing about the machine...

145
00:18:48,802 --> 00:18:50,678
...they let me rot.

146
00:18:50,804 --> 00:18:54,640
Nobody should such a powerful
thing in his possession.

147
00:18:56,017 --> 00:18:57,726
I just want Klaus Listener.

148
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,523
Klaus Sat Listener
in an underground bunker.

149
00:19:02,607 --> 00:19:05,568
If this card is correct,
it's two days of traveling.

150
00:19:05,652 --> 00:19:10,364
Why we have my equipment,
my car and my money?

151
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:15,828
We go to a camp of the militia.
I have a contact: Limak.

152
00:19:15,912 --> 00:19:19,331
For the right price he will
and his men serve as guides.

153
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:21,542
Do you trust him?
-- Of course not.

154
00:19:21,626 --> 00:19:25,337
But I do not go there
unaccompanied.

155
00:19:41,688 --> 00:19:44,190
It is still a mile.

156
00:19:44,274 --> 00:19:46,817
Turn left into a dirt road.

157
00:19:51,239 --> 00:19:52,948
Come on.

158
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:04,627
I think we're there.

159
00:20:04,753 --> 00:20:09,006
The field is expanding faster
than I thought.

160
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:33,113
Get your stuff. The faster
guidance we have, the better.

161
00:20:36,493 --> 00:20:38,827
Stitch, a camp of the militia.

162
00:20:40,914 --> 00:20:43,165
That is, are you ready?

163
00:20:54,719 --> 00:20:57,263
Limak.

164
00:21:04,479 --> 00:21:05,521
Come.

165
00:21:17,742 --> 00:21:20,536
Limak, damn.

166
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:34,133
Be still, hold your breath.

167
00:23:02,472 --> 00:23:04,765
We must continue.

168
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:13,816
Lena...

169
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:18,487
we must go.

170
00:23:27,122 --> 00:23:29,623
From this direction we have come.

171
00:23:30,959 --> 00:23:34,002
We can now to the blow
-- off.

172
00:23:34,421 --> 00:23:36,130
The car does nothing.

173
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:40,718
On foot, we can tomorrow
on the other side.

174
00:23:40,844 --> 00:23:43,011
Say it.

175
00:24:16,963 --> 00:24:19,423
Special forces.

176
00:24:23,303 --> 00:24:25,804
Look.

177
00:24:26,055 --> 00:24:29,475
An EMP, electromagnetic pulse.

178
00:24:30,018 --> 00:24:31,351
He fires off a beam of energy...

179
00:24:31,436 --> 00:24:35,731
that everything electrical within
destroy a certain distance. Handsome.

180
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:37,649
They want to get close...

181
00:24:37,734 --> 00:24:40,819
and destroy the machine.
-- Do we take him?

182
00:24:40,904 --> 00:24:43,947
We can use it in the bunker.
-- He is broken.

183
00:24:44,199 --> 00:24:46,700
We better go.

184
00:27:22,357 --> 00:27:24,274
What are these?

185
00:27:25,151 --> 00:27:28,987
The runic symbols.

186
00:27:32,867 --> 00:27:34,284
Here you go.

187
00:27:35,036 --> 00:27:40,874
There was a Nazi division with special
Weapons, called the Black Sun

188
00:27:41,584 --> 00:27:44,086
They use the symbol
in all their documents.

189
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:49,466
I think it's a code, a
password for the machine to send.

190
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:54,388
It has taken years on tight.
-- A decade or so.

191
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:58,767
I could at least choose.
Mathieu also.

192
00:27:59,602 --> 00:28:04,356
Have you ever wanted to do
something else? -- I do not know.

193
00:28:04,774 --> 00:28:07,693
At first I thought all families
did.

194
00:28:08,194 --> 00:28:12,155
In South America
Search for old men.

195
00:28:13,533 --> 00:28:19,329
And one evening,
I think I was ten...

196
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:22,165
sneaked into his room.

197
00:28:23,126 --> 00:28:26,128
He stood on the balcony crying.

198
00:28:26,713 --> 00:28:30,799
And on the bed were all those pictures.

199
00:28:33,261 --> 00:28:36,596
Klaus Listener and the others,
the things they had done.

200
00:28:38,099 --> 00:28:43,520
I had never seen him cry.
-- If you've caught Klaus Ener...

201
00:28:43,646 --> 00:28:45,522
what then?

202
00:28:47,984 --> 00:28:52,446
No idea.
Then I can choose in each case.

203
00:28:57,869 --> 00:29:00,704
There will always be somebody.

204
00:29:00,997 --> 00:29:05,542
Someone who does everything for power,
another Klaus Listener.

205
00:29:06,294 --> 00:29:11,131
People are like that.
-- The following is not my problem.

206
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:46,393
Damn it.
-- Road here, flight.

207
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:03,827
Come.
Lena?

208
00:31:07,707 --> 00:31:09,749
Godsamme.

209
00:31:10,251 --> 00:31:11,376
Inside.

210
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,930
Damn.

211
00:31:24,056 --> 00:31:26,099
Cover the right.
-- Cover the left.

212
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,102
No...

213
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:40,822
Faster, forward.

214
00:31:43,743 --> 00:31:44,868
Glen...

215
00:31:49,624 --> 00:31:52,375
Road here, walk.

216
00:31:52,501 --> 00:31:54,002
Hurry up.

217
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:00,508
Faster.

218
00:32:04,305 --> 00:32:09,559
Take cover, shoot.
-- Cover.

219
00:32:09,644 --> 00:32:11,561
Beware, friendly fire.

220
00:32:11,646 --> 00:32:14,147
Come on.
-- Fire with the EMP.

221
00:32:15,816 --> 00:32:18,235
Come on, do it now.
-- Contact.

222
00:32:23,616 --> 00:32:27,369
What are you waiting for?
I told you to fire.

223
00:32:27,453 --> 00:32:28,495
That is not the mission.

224
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:31,873
If we perish,
there is no longer mission.

225
00:33:24,719 --> 00:33:27,012
That was it.

226
00:33:34,353 --> 00:33:36,521
It'll be fine.

227
00:33:51,203 --> 00:33:53,621
Stay with me, pal.

228
00:34:17,396 --> 00:34:18,438
Damn.

229
00:34:18,522 --> 00:34:22,525
Are you going to do bold?
See, that was my buddy.

230
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:26,363
He died to save you.
Soon you see look like that.

231
00:34:26,447 --> 00:34:28,573
Relax.

232
00:34:30,076 --> 00:34:34,579
What are you doing in this enclosed area?
-- We are journalists.

233
00:34:34,663 --> 00:34:36,289
Yes?

234
00:34:39,085 --> 00:34:41,336
Against the wall.
Fingers.

235
00:34:41,796 --> 00:34:43,797
I'll take that.

236
00:34:45,007 --> 00:34:47,509
Legs apart.

237
00:34:48,302 --> 00:34:52,013
I see the error
or the operation failed completely?

238
00:34:52,098 --> 00:34:54,516
The physics teacher is dead.
What did he say again?

239
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,268
It's all or nothing,
You only get one chance.

240
00:34:57,353 --> 00:35:00,063
Don't blow not.
-- As if we had the choice.

241
00:35:00,147 --> 00:35:04,234
They are dead, and we go there too.
-- Shut up, Hall.

242
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:08,488
No press pass and no camera.

243
00:35:08,572 --> 00:35:12,659
But you know your story,
Mr. Wallace.

244
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:17,580
What I want to know,
is how he recognized you.

245
00:35:19,667 --> 00:35:23,503
He saw me for someone else.
-- It was a klotedag.

246
00:35:23,921 --> 00:35:26,756
Stop that bullshit.

247
00:35:26,841 --> 00:35:29,759
Shoot him, you know 't ever.
-- It is.

248
00:35:29,844 --> 00:35:33,099
Hall, put her in the eye.
-- Good. Hold on.

249
00:35:40,855 --> 00:35:43,356
I am engineer.

250
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:50,155
Are you a scientist?
Physical, surely?

251
00:35:50,573 --> 00:35:54,033
Is she your secretary?
-- I am looking for war criminals, Nazis.

252
00:35:54,118 --> 00:35:56,953
Then you're good here, darling.

253
00:35:57,037 --> 00:36:00,832
And here is what you want
get their hands on, right?

254
00:36:00,916 --> 00:36:05,753
And do not you?
Please, let me guess.

255
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:09,799
You warrant to stop the machine
and save the world.

256
00:36:09,884 --> 00:36:13,094
And bring so
Muir thought it worked.

257
00:36:13,179 --> 00:36:17,307
Firstly:
I recommend you go to nothing, asshole.

258
00:36:17,391 --> 00:36:20,477
Secondly,
how do you know he Muir called?

259
00:36:24,607 --> 00:36:25,690
Damn.

260
00:36:28,027 --> 00:36:29,194
Sucks.

261
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:35,116
You better talk.

262
00:36:35,951 --> 00:36:39,787
There are few specialists in this field.
-- That they say.

263
00:36:40,289 --> 00:36:42,665
So this is your lucky day.

264
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:46,169
Throw him in the car,
we have a new expert.

265
00:36:46,253 --> 00:36:47,712
One moment.

266
00:36:47,796 --> 00:36:50,673
Remember that this operation
of fell...

267
00:36:50,758 --> 00:36:53,426
when the second EMP failed.

268
00:36:53,511 --> 00:36:57,138
This operation is not over until
I tell you.

269
00:36:57,223 --> 00:36:59,849
You know what happens
if we do nothing.

270
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:07,857
Does that pulse magnetic field
deactivated?

271
00:37:07,942 --> 00:37:10,068
Then we can kill them.

272
00:37:10,152 --> 00:37:12,403
No, the EMP has a limited
scope.

273
00:37:12,488 --> 00:37:15,823
We had to close.
-- He's right.

274
00:37:15,908 --> 00:37:20,078
This device is good for
five or six miles at most.

275
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:24,040
How far are we from the goal?
-- Thirteen miles.

276
00:37:24,124 --> 00:37:27,252
The next ten kilometers
we can afknallen.

277
00:37:27,336 --> 00:37:29,003
Then you think thirteen kilometers...

278
00:37:29,088 --> 00:37:33,800
how my mission without that thing
may close, Mr. Wallace.

279
00:37:36,554 --> 00:37:39,931
Welcome to the emptier boy.
-- What a luck I have.

280
00:37:59,743 --> 00:38:02,161
Where do you go?

281
00:38:02,705 --> 00:38:05,832
No academic qualifications, no place.
-- View the.

282
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:10,628
A lady here leave neat.
-- We go.

283
00:38:10,713 --> 00:38:13,006
We encircle the bag.

284
00:38:16,635 --> 00:38:20,305
Find a safe place.
A basement, somewhere underground.

285
00:38:20,389 --> 00:38:23,975
With luck, the cavalry
within a day.

286
00:38:26,353 --> 00:38:28,646
If you remember way back...

287
00:38:28,772 --> 00:38:30,398
go back.

288
00:38:31,191 --> 00:38:32,775
Jesus...

289
00:39:08,354 --> 00:39:09,437
Sir...

290
00:39:10,439 --> 00:39:14,275
Bravo-- Charlie-- 4, this is 
the command. -- Go ahead.

291
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:18,446
There is a pulse in the field shot.
-- How close to the target?

292
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:21,366
Not close enough.
-- Can you see who it was?

293
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:24,327
The location indicates the Alpha team.

294
00:39:24,411 --> 00:39:26,579
But we're not sure.
-- And Team Beta?

295
00:39:26,664 --> 00:39:30,500
A mild rash five hours back.
Too little for a real shot.

296
00:39:30,584 --> 00:39:32,794
Previously a refusal.
-- Damn.

297
00:39:39,134 --> 00:39:42,845
If both teams are off,
we see our options.

298
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:47,100
There is still time.
-- Without EMP to nothing.

299
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:49,894
We need to go.
-- This is my battlefield.

300
00:39:49,978 --> 00:39:54,524
I decide on the deployment of nuclear
weapons. There is still time, we wait.

301
00:39:54,608 --> 00:39:56,442
Clear?

302
00:40:46,452 --> 00:40:50,079
No, it's not scary, nor stupid.

303
00:40:51,373 --> 00:40:54,250
No academic qualifications, no place.

304
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:58,463
At which university they
learn to push ups? Acorns.

305
00:43:25,068 --> 00:43:26,944
Come.

306
00:43:30,532 --> 00:43:33,659
Come out of the way.
-- Where is my notebook?

307
00:43:33,744 --> 00:43:36,495
Wait, my notebook.

308
00:43:36,622 --> 00:43:39,290
Further down dip.

309
00:43:43,086 --> 00:43:44,337
No...

310
00:43:49,468 --> 00:43:51,552
Let me go.

311
00:43:55,849 --> 00:43:58,309
No...

312
00:43:59,102 --> 00:44:01,604
I have had you not done anything?

313
00:45:43,915 --> 00:45:46,459
Nothing.
They are here.

314
00:45:50,964 --> 00:45:54,717
That he injected him?
What did he do?

315
00:45:56,845 --> 00:45:58,679
No idea.

316
00:45:59,264 --> 00:46:01,891
Maybe he wanted him
just like they make.

317
00:46:02,267 --> 00:46:04,560
Nazis are real bastards.

318
00:46:04,644 --> 00:46:07,813
Without my notebook
I can not do anything.

319
00:46:07,898 --> 00:46:10,691
Without the codes and symbols...
-- Zeik not.

320
00:46:10,776 --> 00:46:14,570
Without your balls
would you worse bleating.

321
00:46:16,573 --> 00:46:20,159
But you've worked there for years.
-- Jae very long.

322
00:46:20,243 --> 00:46:23,079
Therefore, I had just a notebook.

323
00:46:27,918 --> 00:46:30,836
Write down everything, okay?

324
00:46:34,841 --> 00:46:39,804
Dane this has taken time.
We must go faster.

325
00:46:41,723 --> 00:46:45,309
With you, I need to talk.

326
00:46:50,273 --> 00:46:53,067
What are you doing here?
-- Thanks for coming.

327
00:46:53,151 --> 00:46:58,030
If you just bothers me...
-- We must hurry.

328
00:46:58,115 --> 00:47:01,951
Then manage it before the big bang.
-- Blast?

329
00:47:04,788 --> 00:47:07,039
If it is not within the
prescribed time does...

330
00:47:07,124 --> 00:47:10,417
they assume that it fails
and they choose the latter option.

331
00:47:10,502 --> 00:47:13,587
Seven tonnes up.

332
00:47:20,095 --> 00:47:22,012
There are thousands
of people live here.

333
00:47:22,097 --> 00:47:25,099
And millions of people die
if we do not stop.

334
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:29,854
It should make us succeed.
To discuss what nobody.

335
00:47:31,231 --> 00:47:33,524
Wait, now she suddenly last?

336
00:47:37,445 --> 00:47:41,824
As a babysitter for Hansel and Gretel,
what madness.

337
00:48:16,359 --> 00:48:18,694
Here it should be.

338
00:48:55,565 --> 00:48:58,901
I had expected
that this printer would be.

339
00:48:59,194 --> 00:49:02,821
They celebrate feast elsewhere.
-- Yes, whether it is a perfect trap.

340
00:49:02,906 --> 00:49:07,368
The main entrance is in any case
the end of our career.

341
00:49:08,536 --> 00:49:12,414
Set the safe side, find the
Rear entry, you have five minutes.

342
00:49:13,875 --> 00:49:17,503
Do not forget:
I know the machine, not them.

343
00:49:17,587 --> 00:49:21,882
I try something. Can not run.
-- And Klaus Listener?

344
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:25,511
With him, you must pay.

345
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:31,558
Until now, the child,
now it is intense.

346
00:49:31,643 --> 00:49:35,396
If we strike
we do it as fast as possible.

347
00:49:40,193 --> 00:49:43,070
The field is empty.
-- Nothing, not even a rabbit hole.

348
00:49:43,154 --> 00:49:45,531
Carlisle left, right
-- Hall.

349
00:49:45,615 --> 00:49:49,827
Abbott, we take the center with the
girls. Position your at the doors.

350
00:50:03,341 --> 00:50:04,591
Keep going.

351
00:50:11,474 --> 00:50:12,933
Continue.

352
00:50:17,272 --> 00:50:21,025
What happened here?
-- Is not nut out.

353
00:50:21,109 --> 00:50:23,277
Looking for cables, in this thickness.

354
00:50:23,361 --> 00:50:27,156
That we should follow.
-- And then? Without EMP?

355
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:29,950
I must go to the command center.
-- Forward.

356
00:51:55,370 --> 00:51:57,496
That's him.

357
00:52:08,007 --> 00:52:09,425
Inside.

358
00:52:21,563 --> 00:52:23,939
He should be here his shit.

359
00:52:25,442 --> 00:52:30,279
Damn it.
-- He should be here.

360
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:34,283
The military intelligence
delivers again great work.

361
00:52:39,747 --> 00:52:43,125
That is...
This is Hunt's handwriting.

362
00:52:44,335 --> 00:52:47,087
Check this out.

363
00:52:54,596 --> 00:52:57,979
And Klaus Listener?

364
00:53:11,571 --> 00:53:13,614
Since there are even more.

365
00:53:23,791 --> 00:53:24,875
Here.

366
00:53:29,339 --> 00:53:31,256
Hunt's notes prove...

367
00:53:31,341 --> 00:53:33,926
that he only works
and solves problems.

368
00:53:34,093 --> 00:53:39,181
Klaus Listener is not been here.
-- Why?

369
00:53:39,265 --> 00:53:43,894
That is not logical.
-- Klaus Energy Hunt sent hither.

370
00:53:47,482 --> 00:53:52,027
Klaus Ener wanted or
could not be here.

371
00:53:52,654 --> 00:53:55,322
Hunt put everything in motion.

372
00:53:55,949 --> 00:54:00,911
Klaus Listener's men
search for daddy.

373
00:54:00,995 --> 00:54:05,459
There is a cell or something.
-- It's a cell.

374
00:54:08,002 --> 00:54:13,298
The energy of the motor there was
together since they were created.

375
00:54:39,909 --> 00:54:42,536
Always the right answers.

376
00:54:45,748 --> 00:54:48,375
Can you infer
where they have gone?

377
00:54:48,459 --> 00:54:53,130
Where does' t magnetic field
come from? -- No idea.

378
00:54:53,464 --> 00:54:56,592
The notes are those of
a lunatic. Look.

379
00:54:56,676 --> 00:54:59,720
Hunt also what they have done,
it was diabolical.

380
00:54:59,804 --> 00:55:03,473
Everything revolves around the field
and energy generation.

381
00:55:03,558 --> 00:55:06,268
I look at it again better.
-- No.

382
00:55:06,352 --> 00:55:09,605
Take as much as you can bear,
we leave here.

383
00:55:09,689 --> 00:55:13,859
This material is unheard important.
-- It was not a question.

384
00:55:28,124 --> 00:55:31,918
Ready?
-- I can not just go.

385
00:55:32,003 --> 00:55:35,881
About eight hours everything
here is completely charred.

386
00:55:35,965 --> 00:55:39,801
If we do not go
we are not at a safe distance.

387
00:55:40,928 --> 00:55:46,099
Take your pick.
-- I really thought I was close.

388
00:55:46,184 --> 00:55:50,145
It's been pretty
that you've met up here.

389
00:55:50,938 --> 00:55:52,981
The next time you pick it.

390
00:55:58,863 --> 00:56:01,239
Your friend Wallace is right.

391
00:56:01,616 --> 00:56:05,786
I had the machine safeguarding
and Klaus Listener nab.

392
00:56:06,537 --> 00:56:09,956
You have many powerful friends.

393
00:56:11,459 --> 00:56:14,836
Maybe I can
to some people imagine.

394
00:56:16,047 --> 00:56:17,506
Well?

395
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:23,762
Beware.

396
00:56:54,335 --> 00:56:58,839
Let go away there.
-- Make sure you get away.

397
00:56:59,382 --> 00:57:01,758
Coverage.
-- On the ground.

398
00:57:01,843 --> 00:57:03,719
Let go.

399
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:05,262
Road here.

400
00:57:05,346 --> 00:57:08,306
Not back inside, outside.

401
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:10,392
Sam...

402
00:57:39,255 --> 00:57:42,340
Time's up.
We gotta go.

403
00:57:53,936 --> 00:57:57,773
Regret it
you need the sector.

404
00:57:58,024 --> 00:58:00,901
We can send one.
Confirm, please.

405
00:58:00,985 --> 00:58:02,778
We need support.

406
00:58:04,655 --> 00:58:07,574
Send us reinforcements.
They break through.

407
00:58:07,658 --> 00:58:10,118
Sire contact with the enemy
the defenses.

408
00:58:10,203 --> 00:58:11,828
One mile east.

409
00:58:13,915 --> 00:58:16,625
That was it.

410
00:58:30,014 --> 00:58:34,142
He still had at least
can leave an address.

411
00:58:37,438 --> 00:58:39,856
Where would you place him?

412
00:58:48,241 --> 00:58:53,078
Lena, he is still here.
The machine is not moved.

413
00:58:53,204 --> 00:58:55,121
That's impossible...

414
00:58:55,206 --> 00:58:58,917
for he is always in the center
of the field that it generates.

415
00:58:59,001 --> 00:59:01,711
The map shows only other trees.

416
00:59:04,507 --> 00:59:08,218
This is really ridiculous.

417
00:59:09,095 --> 00:59:13,139
Have fun searching
to the secret room, darling.

418
00:59:13,224 --> 00:59:17,102
I 'm out for me under
terechtkom a mushroom cloud.

419
00:59:17,186 --> 00:59:19,020
The operation is not over yet.

420
00:59:19,105 --> 00:59:21,857
He is carefully hidden somewhere.

421
00:59:21,941 --> 00:59:27,362
Along with Elvis and the Easter Bunny.
-- He's right. We're ready.

422
00:59:27,446 --> 00:59:30,073
My hero.
-- Damn...

423
00:59:30,741 --> 00:59:34,411
Many people find that 'never give up
Him or Her romantic mentality.

424
00:59:34,495 --> 00:59:38,665
But I would prefer your head
rams against the wall.

425
00:59:38,749 --> 00:59:42,005
Macavoy is dead, the machine is
gone, this mission is over.

426
00:59:45,089 --> 00:59:48,508
You can not go, there is still a chance.
-- Yes?

427
00:59:48,593 --> 00:59:52,345
Since when you tell us
what to do, Princess?

428
00:59:52,430 --> 00:59:57,058
Danny, this is for tough guys.
We go off like a hare.

429
00:59:57,143 --> 01:00:01,062
And where? If you go now,
You can keep running.

430
01:00:01,147 --> 01:00:02,898
Because they do not stop.

431
01:00:02,982 --> 01:00:05,567
Not in the next village or country.

432
01:00:05,735 --> 01:00:10,780
We can only stop here.
-- Forget it.

433
01:00:11,866 --> 01:00:13,617
Let them go.

434
01:00:18,331 --> 01:00:22,792
He was right about you all.
Go to hell.

435
01:00:39,477 --> 01:00:40,936
Danny?

436
01:00:48,444 --> 01:00:50,236
Damn.

437
01:01:00,039 --> 01:01:01,081
Best.

438
01:01:01,415 --> 01:01:05,710
Look for an entrance,
for anything unusual.

439
01:01:05,795 --> 01:01:08,046
As if something just is.

440
01:01:08,130 --> 01:01:12,384
And lay a trail of breadcrumbs,
for if you get lost.

441
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:41,913
What is the most logical reason
to move it?

442
01:01:47,795 --> 01:01:50,630
Are you really sure?
-- Yes.

443
01:01:53,759 --> 01:01:55,635
Fucking shit.

444
01:01:57,179 --> 01:02:01,891
Was I 'm but smeared
but it was too late.

445
01:02:05,563 --> 01:02:08,023
Where are you right answers?

446
01:02:32,506 --> 01:02:35,425
We need this wall.

447
01:02:35,509 --> 01:02:37,343
But of course.

448
01:02:37,762 --> 01:02:41,806
Do you have a nervous breakdown?
Is that it?

449
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:48,188
Look for a panel
on the other side.

450
01:02:50,983 --> 01:02:53,443
This should be up there.

451
01:02:53,527 --> 01:02:57,405
It was written
when this door was still open.

452
01:02:57,490 --> 01:02:59,032
Here there is one.

453
01:03:02,036 --> 01:03:03,161
Good.

454
01:03:42,159 --> 01:03:45,203
This is a well hidden elevator.

455
01:03:49,917 --> 01:03:53,002
What do we do now?
-- What we always do.

456
01:03:53,462 --> 01:03:55,672
You light fires bullets.

457
01:03:59,093 --> 01:04:00,969
Once we're outside, you shoot them.

458
01:04:01,053 --> 01:04:05,140
Then the planes that we know
here and they blow the whole thing not.

459
01:04:06,809 --> 01:04:08,893
Stay alive, girls.

460
01:04:08,978 --> 01:04:13,356
Nobody believes me later
if you do not confirm.

461
01:04:22,825 --> 01:04:27,203
I go first, you follow.
And keep you quiet.

462
01:04:37,298 --> 01:04:40,175
Do you know how you use it?

463
01:07:02,192 --> 01:07:03,609
Wallace...

464
01:07:06,405 --> 01:07:07,488
That way.

465
01:08:35,953 --> 01:08:37,787
Here, take this.

466
01:08:49,925 --> 01:08:52,343
Come.
Damn.

467
01:09:06,650 --> 01:09:11,195
Let me go.
-- Small gypsy jew.

468
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:15,992
Hold on.
Let me go, damn bitch.

469
01:09:16,493 --> 01:09:19,245
No...

470
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:36,095
Come.

471
01:10:01,788 --> 01:10:05,093
Children.

472
01:10:21,558 --> 01:10:24,977
Here, this should be the control room.

473
01:10:30,192 --> 01:10:31,734
Fri

474
01:10:33,403 --> 01:10:37,823
Do you know what you're looking for?
-- A kind of schedule over the ministry.

475
01:10:43,830 --> 01:10:46,207
Here, good.

476
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:49,919
The machine and the expansion 
chambers are there...

477
01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:52,880
and from here to be sent.

478
01:10:53,090 --> 01:10:57,468
Here's the inside that divides it.
-- Can you do that?

479
01:10:58,637 --> 01:11:00,888
Yes, it works
as a pressure cooker.

480
01:11:00,973 --> 01:11:06,185
We maximize the ability
that generates the complex...

481
01:11:06,270 --> 01:11:11,148
and then block the energy drain.
We overload the system.

482
01:11:11,608 --> 01:11:13,901
That is our EMP.

483
01:11:25,372 --> 01:11:30,084
No, no. That's not fair.

484
01:11:30,168 --> 01:11:33,129
What is that?
-- Safety Vent.

485
01:11:37,301 --> 01:11:39,176
Handsome machine.

486
01:11:48,228 --> 01:11:51,439
That works well.
We're almost there.

487
01:11:53,442 --> 01:11:57,361
Stop it now goes.
-- What?

488
01:11:57,571 --> 01:12:01,657
The system is well designed,
it does not want me to destroy.

489
01:12:05,495 --> 01:12:07,204
Damn.

490
01:12:13,337 --> 01:12:17,423
You must go, I must stay here.
-- Only you know the machine.

491
01:12:17,507 --> 01:12:21,052
If I go, then, can we never
to fire off an EMP.

492
01:12:21,136 --> 01:12:24,513
If we wait until he has fired?
-- We can not do.

493
01:12:24,598 --> 01:12:27,224
If things go wrong,
we never come here.

494
01:12:27,309 --> 01:12:31,354
Here, if the pulse did not work 
try this. There is a kind face.

495
01:12:31,438 --> 01:12:35,941
Save it with a hammer or
whatever on. Forward.

496
01:12:36,068 --> 01:12:40,780
And take care of yourself.

497
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:58,422
Alright.

498
01:13:49,599 --> 01:13:52,230
Come. Well verdommee
cheap rattletrap.

499
01:15:05,717 --> 01:15:09,970
Is that Klaus Listener?
-- No. It is Hunt.

500
01:15:22,901 --> 01:15:25,694
Come, godsamme.

501
01:15:27,989 --> 01:15:29,406
Forward.

502
01:16:03,275 --> 01:16:04,900
Sieg Heil, bitch.

503
01:16:21,001 --> 01:16:23,627
It failed.

504
01:17:13,887 --> 01:17:15,763
Come, come on.

505
01:17:17,682 --> 01:17:21,435
I try to stop them.
You stay at the machine.

506
01:18:14,322 --> 01:18:16,323
Who are you?

507
01:18:19,703 --> 01:18:23,163
I'm here
Klaus Listener to stop it.

508
01:18:23,248 --> 01:18:26,333
Unfortunately, only I am here.

509
01:18:28,211 --> 01:18:31,964
Would you destroy the machine?
Bring me to.

510
01:18:41,141 --> 01:18:46,979
Try using the electromagnetic
pulse. She thinks I'm stupid.

511
01:18:47,063 --> 01:18:50,024
She is stupid.
They must protect the core.

512
01:18:55,780 --> 01:18:59,575
Stop the heart never.
Klaus Listener's secret.

513
01:19:00,285 --> 01:19:03,328
That never stop. Never.

514
01:19:31,858 --> 01:19:36,403
They forced you to help them.
-- Make the field larger.

515
01:19:37,530 --> 01:19:41,992
Bring them to Dad.
-- I know all about you.

516
01:19:42,452 --> 01:19:46,246
You are not like them.
Help them please do not.

517
01:19:46,331 --> 01:19:49,083
Begging is weak.
I've tried.

518
01:19:51,336 --> 01:19:54,963
I have earned.
I was arrogant.

519
01:19:55,173 --> 01:19:59,885
I wanted to unite the fields
and know how God thinks.

520
01:20:01,096 --> 01:20:04,723
I deserve pain.
Pain is what I know.

521
01:21:02,323 --> 01:21:04,867
Bugger anyway.

522
01:21:18,590 --> 01:21:19,882
I do not understand.

523
01:21:19,966 --> 01:21:24,469
But I have no choice, I must
to a nuclear attack questions.

524
01:21:24,554 --> 01:21:28,056
The light signal of Team Alpha.
-- Ignore it.

525
01:21:28,141 --> 01:21:32,436
Wait with nuclear weapons, but make
that bunker to the ground.

526
01:21:42,488 --> 01:21:45,949
And this? Can I use it?

527
01:21:46,409 --> 01:21:51,330
Unusable. Klaus Listener's secret.
-- Please, I can not.

528
01:21:51,414 --> 01:21:55,167
I do not know it,
and I do not understand.

529
01:21:56,336 --> 01:22:00,839
Two days back I thought that
it was what they had done.

530
01:22:00,924 --> 01:22:03,759
That is not true, what matters...

531
01:22:03,843 --> 01:22:08,055
is what they do.
There, in our world.

532
01:22:08,139 --> 01:22:11,141
The world consists of vibrating
particles, nothing else.

533
01:22:11,226 --> 01:22:13,352
No, there are people.

534
01:22:13,436 --> 01:22:17,606
Innocent people who die
what you wanted...

535
01:22:17,690 --> 01:22:20,317
you hunted and has unleashed.

536
01:22:30,536 --> 01:22:35,332
If you do not help me now...

537
01:22:37,043 --> 01:22:41,421
The love of power
is the demon of humanity.

538
01:22:46,678 --> 01:22:49,933
The heart drives him.
But the core is poetry.

539
01:22:54,978 --> 01:22:59,273
The Black Sun has built him.
Only they have the key.

540
01:24:58,726 --> 01:25:02,979
Gefeliciteerde you've just saved.
Where are the others?

541
01:25:03,231 --> 01:25:05,148
There somewhere.

542
01:25:05,233 --> 01:25:08,235
The rockets are fired,
the planes are coming.

543
01:25:08,319 --> 01:25:11,863
Why were they fired? -- Accidentally.
You learn from your mistakes.

544
01:25:11,948 --> 01:25:14,991
We have four minutes
this here is destroyed.

545
01:25:16,953 --> 01:25:18,537
On the ground.

546
01:26:23,728 --> 01:26:25,729
We must leave.

547
01:26:27,398 --> 01:26:28,648
Garnet.

548
01:26:33,779 --> 01:26:37,240
Come.
-- Right behind you.

549
01:29:28,412 --> 01:29:30,705
Here is command Zero.
-- Links Fri

550
01:29:30,790 --> 01:29:32,749
Certainly the statement.
-- Right Fri

551
01:29:32,958 --> 01:29:34,793
Attach over.

552
01:30:35,229 --> 01:30:37,147
Are you alone?

553
01:30:44,363 --> 01:30:47,741
The jets come.
We gotta go.

554
01:30:53,122 --> 01:30:57,959
Hopefully you very quickly.
Because this is really tight.

555
01:31:08,137 --> 01:31:12,265
Was it worth the trip?
-- Yes.

556
01:31:15,603 --> 01:31:17,645
But he did not make it.

557
01:31:33,829 --> 01:31:36,289
I'm sorry real Lena.

558
01:31:36,540 --> 01:31:41,127
In a war you can only one side
choose your own.

559
01:31:50,012 --> 01:31:55,058
ADOC, this is Dragon...
-- 60 meters, to fall.

560
01:31:55,267 --> 01:31:57,602
Got it, now go to the goal.

561
01:32:49,154 --> 01:32:53,032
Give your status on Falcon.
-- We are approaching the target.

562
01:32:53,117 --> 01:32:56,578
Damn it.

563
01:34:09,485 --> 01:34:13,404
It is an honor for me
to meet you.

564
01:34:14,239 --> 01:34:16,991
What do you want?

565
01:34:17,242 --> 01:34:22,705
The question is more what
you need, is not it?

566
01:34:24,792 --> 01:34:28,294
I've always wondered myself
why he was not there.

567
01:34:28,379 --> 01:34:32,548
A man who would give everything
be there as the Empire rises again.

568
01:34:33,175 --> 01:34:35,218
Why was he not?

569
01:34:35,636 --> 01:34:40,890
The truth is that he could not.
He is weak, he is dying.

570
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:45,395
Sure, you had a new machine
can build.

571
01:34:45,479 --> 01:34:49,485
But that one part
you could never recreate.

572
01:34:54,238 --> 01:34:56,489
Thus was it?

573
01:35:03,455 --> 01:35:07,250
You did not have to send Hunt.
Too many scruples.

574
01:35:07,334 --> 01:35:11,921
You have a lot
pragmatic someone.

575
01:35:13,257 --> 01:35:15,425
50 million seems reasonable.

576
01:35:16,176 --> 01:35:22,098
If you're thinking about me
to murder, you will notice...

577
01:35:22,182 --> 01:35:25,601
that some essential elements
are missing.

578
01:35:27,271 --> 01:35:30,815
You were the plan, right?
Old creep.

579
01:35:34,570 --> 01:35:36,946
See it, let's say 60 million.

580
01:35:37,448 --> 01:35:41,367
Relax, you fuck like you.

581
01:35:42,369 --> 01:35:47,415
Hold on. Perhaps there
by more parties offered.

582
01:35:48,167 --> 01:35:50,877
And you want a bit of struggle.

583
01:35:51,336 --> 01:35:52,962
Surprise.

584
01:35:53,255 --> 01:35:58,760
Risen from the dead.
-- Yes, the bunker is indestructible.

585
01:35:59,261 --> 01:36:05,016
It was nothing personal.
As I said, I'm sorry.

586
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:09,353
Was it true?
-- What do you mean?

587
01:36:09,813 --> 01:36:13,274
That they have more fun.

588
01:36:15,819 --> 01:36:20,114
I think you're right. There will always be
Klaus is a next Listener.

589
01:36:21,700 --> 01:36:25,620
He has a name on my list.
Now there are two.

590
01:36:26,622 --> 01:36:29,373
First I'm going after you.

591
01:36:30,375 --> 01:36:35,088
I wish you much success.
I made new friends.

592
01:36:35,756 --> 01:36:38,883
The war has widened,
young lady.

593
01:36:39,718 --> 01:36:44,263
What if we are behind you entering?
-- I will await you.
