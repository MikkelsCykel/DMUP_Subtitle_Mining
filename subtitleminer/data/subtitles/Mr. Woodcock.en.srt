1
00:00:30,063 --> 00:00:31,360
Ha!

2
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:29,585
What is this?

3
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,321
Uh!

4
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:41,764
Good hands, Nedderman.
Take a lap.

5
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:48,168
By itself, a basketball
is just a round sack of air.

6
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:50,275
Like many of you.

7
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,574
But in the hands of
someone properly trained...

8
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,136
in its use and skilled in its art...

9
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,774
this ball can do great things.

10
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:59,114
Oates, I can hear you
wheezing from here.

11
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:01,347
Take a lap. Lose the asthma.

12
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:04,714
To survive
outside these walls...

13
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:07,055
you need more than
just math and science.

14
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:08,390
The world does not stop...

15
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:09,918
for people who can spell
fancy words...

16
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,624
or tell you
the capital of Montana.

17
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:13,632
The capital of Montana, Watson?

18
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,725
- Helena?
- Who cares? Take a lap.

19
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:20,903
The only thing that matters
in this world, ladies, is strength.

20
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,465
Strength of body
and strength of mind.

21
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,772
Now if you're not
strong enough...

22
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,335
by the time you leave
these doors...

23
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:28,870
you may as well give up
and go home to your mommas.

24
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,451
Or grandma.
Put your hand down, Lewis.

25
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:36,148
We all know your parents died.
Give it a rest.

26
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,456
- Oh!
- Pick up the pace, Nedderman.

27
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:47,865
Well, Farley, it looks like you
forgot your gym clothes again.

28
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:49,425
No, sir, somebody--

29
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:51,027
It's a rhetorical question,
Farley.

30
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,560
- What?
- It's a rhetorical question.

31
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:54,596
That means you don't have
to answer it.

32
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:56,404
Because either
I already know the answer...

33
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:58,740
or I don't care
what your answer is.

34
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:00,405
You see, in my class, Farley...

35
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:03,904
everyone is required to wear
regulation gym shorts and shirt.

36
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,885
Gutierrez, go get the rentals.

37
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,081
Start changing.

38
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:11,420
- No, in line.
- What?

39
00:03:11,457 --> 00:03:13,220
See, the locker room
is reserved...

40
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:16,160
for people who brought
the appropriate attire.

41
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,426
- You change here.
- It's OK, John. Be strong.

42
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:20,989
No talking, Nedderman. 10 laps.

43
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,195
Take Wheezy with you.

44
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:26,503
Come on, let's go.

45
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:38,844
The rentals, Farley,
that's 25 cents.

46
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,547
- But somebody stole my--
- l--I didn't ask you a question, Farley.

47
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:43,556
- Not even a rhetorical one.
- Uh...

48
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,286
It seems to me
that someone needs a lesson...

49
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:48,157
in personal responsibility.

50
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:52,196
Not even one chin-up,
Farley?

51
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,460
Can't hang on!

52
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:55,262
You are a disgrace to fat...

53
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:58,793
gelatinous, out-of-shape
little kids the world over.

54
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:01,864
I don't tolerate losers
in my gymnasium.

55
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,775
- Are you gonna be a loser?
- No, sir.

56
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:08,406
Rhetorical, Farley.
I already know the answer.

57
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:10,245
Heads up, Nedderman.

58
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,378
Uh!

59
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:17,614
Don't you even think
about letting go.

60
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:19,386
Uh!

61
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,693
- You guys ready to let go?
- Yeah!

62
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:30,703
All right!

63
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:32,068
- Mr. Farley?
- Oh, sure. How you doing?

64
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,629
- All right, what's your name?
- Scott.

65
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:34,833
John, you don't have
time for this.

66
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:36,307
- Oh...
- Bye-bye.

67
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:37,400
I'm sorry, guys.

68
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:38,432
- Keep letting go.
- John! John!

69
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:44,449
OK, now remember they're
all potential stalkers.

70
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:46,111
Most want an autograph
and a handshake...

71
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:48,313
but some of them want an
autograph and a handshake...

72
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:50,083
and then they want to
take you home, tie you up...

73
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,886
and saw your feet off.

74
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:54,324
- Well, hi there.
- John Farley.

75
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,191
Your book saved my life.

76
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:58,493
I didn't do anything.
You did it.

77
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:00,761
All I did was
give you the raft.

78
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,529
- You had to inflate it yourself.
- Mm-hm.

79
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:06,800
Mr. Farley, I used to feel
ostracized because of my weight.

80
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:10,104
But with your help I'm starting
to get my self-confidence back.

81
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,542
Ha! That's a great story.

82
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:13,602
Why don't you check out
the free coffee and donuts?

83
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,170
Oh!

84
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:20,550
By letting go, do you mean we
should just forget everything?

85
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:22,747
My mom said he wouldn't drink
so much...

86
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:25,690
if he could just forget about that summer
in Uncle Lou's house.

87
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:27,625
Well, we all have
an Uncle Lou.

88
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,958
And we all drink
for different reasons.

89
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,830
Long day.

90
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:35,095
I don't even think I can hold
a pen anymore.

91
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:37,432
Let me give you the same advice
I gave Nelson Mandela...

92
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,370
on his last book tour.

93
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:41,236
Quit whining, you pussy.

94
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:43,742
- That's helpful.
- You have no idea...

95
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:45,471
the stuff that
I am saving you from.

96
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:48,275
Some shithole in Nebraska
wanted to give you...

97
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:51,943
their corn husk bucket
or something.

98
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:54,179
The Corn Cob Key?

99
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,950
Uh, is that what it is?
L--I don't know. "The Forest--

100
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:58,980
"...Meadow Nebraska
Chamber of Commerce...

101
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:03,519
"wishes to award Mr. John Farley
the Corn Cob Key to the City."

102
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:05,531
Oh, my God. This is my hometown.

103
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:07,829
- This is awesome. What did you tell them?
- I told them yes.

104
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,266
- Really?
- No.

105
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:10,394
Why? Wait.

106
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:13,496
Maggie, the Corn Cob Key
is a huge honor.

107
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,131
They hardly ever
give it out anymore...

108
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:17,267
but when they do it's the
highlight of the whole cornival.

109
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,338
I'm sorry.
Did you just say cornival?

110
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,144
Well, yeah. It's a farm town...

111
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:26,618
so, you know, every year
we have this big celebration.

112
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,447
Corn carnival. Cornival.

113
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:31,889
- Cornival.
- Maggie, you don't understand.

114
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:34,085
My mom was Corn Cob Queen
in 1970.

115
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:36,118
I mean, she still rides
in the parade every year.

116
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:38,596
- This will mean so much to her.
- Cornival?

117
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:40,360
You know what?
Call them back.

118
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,630
I could fly in tomorrow
and surprise her. It's perfect.

119
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:46,399
You would need a court order
to make me go see my mom.

120
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:50,273
This is different. Since my dad
died, I'm all she's got.

121
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:52,209
Oh, your dad's dead?

122
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,372
It's a major theme of my book.

123
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:57,781
The whole last chapter's
about how I let go of that pain.

124
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:02,213
You haven't read my book,
have you?

125
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:05,088
Well, there's no point now.
You just ruined the ending.

126
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:23,865
Hi, John!

127
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:31,975
Welcome home, John. Ha ha ha!

128
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:34,612
Luke Jessop, uh, Forest Meadow
Town Council.

129
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:38,146
We appreciate you taking time
out of your busy schedule...

130
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:40,182
to--to--to come home and see
the little people.

131
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:42,091
Thank you. This is great.

132
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,722
It's an honor to be considered
worthy of the Corn Cob Key.

133
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:46,322
Well, you've earned it, young--

134
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,630
Young man.
We are mighty proud of you.

135
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,230
So on behalf of--of--

136
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:56,764
Well, of all of us, John...

137
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,936
- Corn-gratulations!
- Ha ha ha!

138
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:20,490
...Famous award-winning corn chowder--

139
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:34,345
- Johnny! Oh, my God, you're here!
- Hey!

140
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,813
- How are you?
- Oh!

141
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:38,316
I heard your news and I tried to
call you but now you're here!

142
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,216
I was flying in.
I wanted to surprise you.

143
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:41,982
- Oh! I am so proud of you.
- Thank you, Mom.

144
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,613
How's it going?
Is the book tour good?

145
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:45,351
- Yeah, it's good.
- Are you having fun?

146
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:46,722
Yeah, I'm happy. You look great.

147
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:48,386
- Thanks.
- Yeah. You going somewhere?

148
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:50,224
Yeah. I have a date.

149
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:51,696
- Really?
- Yeah.

150
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:53,323
- A--Are you seeing someone?
- Yeah.

151
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,800
Oh, my God. That's fantastic.
For how long?

152
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:58,099
- 5 months.
- What? Why didn't you mention it?

153
00:08:58,137 --> 00:09:00,002
Oh, because you don't like
to hear when I have a date.

154
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,439
- Oh, well, so what's he like?
- Oh, he's great.

155
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:06,309
He's so handsome and he's--
he's sweet and consid--

156
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:09,075
- He's a gentleman.
- Oh, Mom, I'm so happy for you.

157
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:10,548
- Thanks.
- I can't wait to meet him.

158
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,847
- You know, you know him already.
- I do?

159
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:13,874
Yeah.

160
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,466
Mr. Woodcock?

161
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,638
Farley, I brought you
some daisies.

162
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:41,036
- Jasper!
- Sorry, I'm late, honey.

163
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:43,914
That's OK.

164
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,248
Uh, this is Johnny.

165
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:49,083
My son.
Do you remember him now?

166
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:50,748
No.

167
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,549
- But I've heard a lot.
- Hm.

168
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,027
It's not every day you get to
shake hands with a celebrity.

169
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:57,256
Ha ha ha!

170
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,793
- Uh, you ready for dinner?
- Mm-hm.

171
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,164
I don't know
about you...

172
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:04,260
but I've been thinking
about meat all day long.

173
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:10,798
I can't believe
you don't remember him.

174
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:12,276
He was the cutest kid.

175
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:14,336
About this high
with his chubby little cheeks.

176
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,508
- Mom.
- I had a lot of fat kids over the years.

177
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,609
Oh, he wasn't fat!

178
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:21,620
Wait a minute.

179
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:23,645
It's coming back to me.

180
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:25,884
You're not that kid
that got the squirts...

181
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:27,324
on the balance beam
that time, were you?

182
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,658
- Jasper.
- No.

183
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:33,563
Actually I remember you
pretty well.

184
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,760
You kinda gave me a lot of
personal attention back then.

185
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:38,861
- Aw.
- Well, I take a healthy interest in the kids.

186
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:40,735
Serves them well
later in life.

187
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:44,209
Oh, that's so true, that's
so true. And that is why...

188
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:48,270
they're making Jasper
the Educator of the Year.

189
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,805
- You're kidding!
- Why would she be kidding?

190
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:54,251
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!
You know what I just realized?

191
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:58,780
Both of my fellas are being
honored in the same week.

192
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:03,386
They're giving Johnny
the Corn Cob Key.

193
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,897
You're kidding.

194
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:09,765
So I'm doing laps at the Y
and he's in the next lane...

195
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:13,670
and all of a sudden my leg
seizes up and I go under.

196
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:17,301
It was a bad cramp.
And if I remember correctly...

197
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,334
I think it was about...

198
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:21,676
- Right here.
- Ha ha ha.

199
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:26,014
Ahem. So he saved
your life, then?

200
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:28,247
Well, it was
the shallow end.

201
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:30,187
You can drown
in six inches of water.

202
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:31,712
- That is so true.
- Hm.

203
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:34,282
Well, if you will
excuse me...

204
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:36,988
I am going to, uh,
the ladies room.

205
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,224
You boys behave yourself.

206
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:45,094
So what's your book about?

207
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:48,533
Oh. Um...

208
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:51,134
well, it teaches people how to
release painful memories...

209
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:53,372
so they can rebuild
their self-esteem.

210
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:55,277
It's called <i>Letting Go.</i>
<i>How To Get Past Your Past.</i>

211
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:57,646
I'm already past my past.

212
00:11:57,683 --> 00:12:00,277
That's why
it's called my past.

213
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:02,446
Well, some people
find my book helpful.

214
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:04,854
Lot of losers out there,
I guess.

215
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:11,828
Well, would you like
an espresso, er, cappuccino...?

216
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:13,889
- Um, a cup--
- Just the check.

217
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:16,299
Oh, OK.

218
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:18,936
Thanks, guys.

219
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:20,700
Um, my treat.

220
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,605
You're the guest.
I'll take care of it.

221
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:24,632
No, really, it's fine.

222
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:26,338
I can afford it.

223
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:28,107
So you're saying I can't?

224
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:31,005
No, of course not.

225
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:35,214
Well, then, why don't you take
your own advice and, uh, let go?

226
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:40,719
Thank you, Jasper.
That is so sweet.

227
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:44,393
Johnny, don't you have
something to say?

228
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:48,093
Thank you.

229
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:50,932
Don't mention it.

230
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,971
- Ha ha ha.
- I swear to God it's true.

231
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:58,465
No, no, no. No. No.
Thank you, honey.

232
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:02,208
No, I don't believe you.
You did not beat Santa Claus up.

233
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:04,773
- Stop it.
- I was 7 years old at the time.

234
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:07,081
And some kids at school told me
that there's no Santa Claus.

235
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,108
Uh-huh?

236
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:09,883
Well, on Christmas Eve
when I come downstairs...

237
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:11,822
and see some guy messing around
under the Christmas tree...

238
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:13,119
I go to my dad's closet...

239
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,148
- and get a three wood--
- Oh, no!

240
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:15,956
And next thing you know,
Uncle Bob's in the hospital.

241
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:18,225
No! Oh, poor Uncle Bob.

242
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:20,061
Ate the entire Christmas dinner
through a straw that year.

243
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:21,088
- No!
- Yeah.

244
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,602
What a great story.

245
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,661
Well, I guess we'd better
call it a night.

246
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:28,104
It's good to see you,
Mr. Woodcock.

247
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,541
Well, I guess I could let you
have her for one night, Farley.

248
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:33,044
Probably good for
the old hip flexor...

249
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:34,238
to take a night off anyway, huh?

250
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,942
- Jasper!
- Ha ha ha! Yeah.

251
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:41,043
That was a fun night.
Come on, you guys!

252
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:44,715
You guys! Ooooohhhhhh! Mmmm!

253
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:51,288
- I'll call you tomorrow, honey.
- OK.

254
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,729
- Farley.
- Yep.

255
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:54,392
Mr. Woodcock.

256
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,036
And he is just so easy to be with.

257
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:07,671
Last month...
we went camping.

258
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:09,738
- You hate camping.
- I know!

259
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:12,114
I mean, it was just the 2 of us for 3 days...

260
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:13,641
and it was heaven.

261
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,154
Ha ha ha. It was great.

262
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,587
Wow.

263
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:21,454
Johnny, um...

264
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:25,119
this is really the first guy
since your father...

265
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:28,531
that... has felt right.

266
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:32,031
I'll get you some milk.

267
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,570
Oh! Look what I've got.

268
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:41,677
Chocolate, please.

269
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,445
I had a lot of fat kids over the years.

270
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:48,715
- This is Johnny.
- A lot of fat kids.

271
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:49,880
Remember him now?

272
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:51,947
No. A lot of losers out there, I guess.

273
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:53,891
Arrgh!

274
00:14:57,863 --> 00:14:59,455
Probably good
for the old hip flexor...

275
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:01,762
to take a night off anyway, huh?
Ha ha ha!

276
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,358
When did you get here?

277
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:31,629
About 10 minutes after you said
good night to me.

278
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,567
Not even one chin-up, Farley?

279
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,867
You are a disgrace to fat...

280
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:43,272
gelatinous, out-of-shape
little kids the world over.

281
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,005
- Can I get a glass of water, please?
- Sure.

282
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,681
Son of a bitch!

283
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,954
- I'm sorry.
- John Farley?

284
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:07,094
- Nedderman?
- I can't believe it's really you!

285
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,293
I've read your book like 900 times...

286
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:10,461
and I'm not just saying this...

287
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:12,493
it's totally changed my life!

288
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:14,199
Really? That's great, man.

289
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:16,707
Hell, yeah.
I work here full-time...

290
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:19,370
and also I'm starting
my own pool cleaning business.

291
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:22,744
All I've got so far is a van but--but
at least it's a start, right?

292
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:24,612
Well, every journey
has to start somewhere.

293
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,710
Chapter 2.
You're totally right.

294
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:29,721
Totally right.

295
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:36,923
Can you believe it?
The Woodcock pan pizza?

296
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:39,021
What's next,
the Hitler calzone?

297
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:40,827
Yeah, well, you're never
gonna believe this.

298
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:43,164
Mr. Deepdish
is dating my mom.

299
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:46,069
Woodcock?
He's doing your mom?

300
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:48,073
- Wait. I wouldn't say doing--
- Hear that, Mitch?

301
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:49,802
Woodcock's slamming
his mom!

302
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,241
- You don't have to announce it.
- Hey, guys!

303
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:54,245
Check it out. Woodcock's
stuffing this dude's mom.

304
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:56,638
Woodcock's pounding your mom?

305
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,775
Hey, hey, guys, come on.
Show a little respect.

306
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:01,445
How would you feel if Woodcock
was porking your mom?

307
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:04,456
Woodcock's porking your mom!

308
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,390
- Woodcock's porking your mom!
- Hey, shut your trap...

309
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:08,154
or you're not getting
that cheesy bread!

310
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,457
I want my cheesy bread!

311
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:11,895
Then shut up!

312
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:14,660
Keep your mouth shut and you get
your cheesy bread, all right?

313
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:20,038
I'm sorry about that.
You want a slice on the house?

314
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:21,903
Sausage and onion.
Extra sauce, right?

315
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,737
No, I don't really eat
that stuff anymore.

316
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:26,404
Yeah, yeah, l--l--I'd probably
lose my appetite too...

317
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:28,504
if Woodcock was giving it
to my mom.

318
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,913
The guy is pure evil.

319
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:33,349
You know he killed Oates?

320
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,784
- What?
- Yeah.

321
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,414
Remember, Woodcock used to
make Oates do, like, 6 miles...

322
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:39,253
every day after school?

323
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:42,192
The guy had bad asthma, dude,
you can't just run through that.

324
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,923
Holy shit.
Well, when did he die?

325
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:48,023
A couple of years ago.
But it was all Woodcock.

326
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:50,966
Ah--

327
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:53,767
Man, look, we can't blame
Woodcock for Oates's choices.

328
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:56,240
Oates coulda stopped
running, right?

329
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:57,742
When you make
a blame sandwich...

330
00:17:57,776 --> 00:17:59,869
you gotta be prepared
to eat it yourself.

331
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,642
Chapter 10.
You're totally right.

332
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:05,912
So what are you gonna do?

333
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:09,284
I think it's time
Woodcock and I had a talk.

334
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:11,687
The shortest distance
between 2 people--

335
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:13,691
Communication.

336
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:16,819
God, you must get so laid.

337
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:23,231
Farley, pass the ball.

338
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,099
Not even one pull-up, Farley?

339
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:26,866
Are you gonna be a loser, Farley?

340
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:29,100
I don't tolerate losers
in my gymnasium.

341
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:32,304
Now, before we begin our
exploration of wiffleball...

342
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:35,108
I think a little equipment check
is in order.

343
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,844
Well, Dunningham?

344
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:40,943
Spread 'em, Dunningham.

345
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:48,685
That's OK. I don't need to
see the cup, Dunningham.

346
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:49,887
Keep it in your pants.

347
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:57,329
You see, ladies, it's important
that you come prepared to class.

348
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:59,132
Because when we're prepared...

349
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:02,368
then we're ready to face
life's challenges.

350
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:07,140
Well, Farley, let's see whether
or not you came prepared today.

351
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,804
Spread 'em.

352
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:17,221
Excuse me. Do you have
a visitors' pass?

353
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:20,023
Tracy Dettweiler?

354
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:24,518
- John Farley?
- Wh--You remember me?

355
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:26,588
Well, yeah, you're famous!

356
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:29,363
What are you doing here?

357
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:32,234
Oh, gee... what are you doing here?

358
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:34,466
Oh, l--I teach English.

359
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:35,996
- Wow.
- Ha ha ha!

360
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,941
I really wish I had you
as an English teacher.

361
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:39,807
I would have paid
way more attention in class.

362
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,973
Ha ha ha! Wait a minute.
What year were you in again?

363
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,347
Uh, same as you, actually.

364
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:47,113
- Really?
- Yeah. I was--

365
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:49,347
I was actually
your 7th grade lab partner.

366
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,714
Wait. Fat John?

367
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:55,226
- No way! Fat John!
- Yeah.

368
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,728
Yep, I was fat.

369
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:59,128
Ha ha ha!

370
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:01,359
Wow, you've changed a lot.

371
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,925
Yeah. Thank you.

372
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:06,199
You're welcome. A--And they're
giving you the Corn Cob Key.

373
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:08,502
- I mean, that's amazing.
- Nah, it's nothing.

374
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,600
Don't be modest.
L--l--I love your book.

375
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:14,407
I mean, you totally deserve
the award.

376
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:16,243
- Wh--Really?
- Yeah.

377
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:18,272
- Wow, thank you.
- Mm.

378
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:22,014
Say, listen, what are you doing
tonight? Do you want to, uh--um...

379
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,022
uh, a drink or go out for dinner
or something?

380
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,854
I'd... love to but l--I can't.

381
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,792
I've got cheerleading practice.

382
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:30,852
- That's awesome.
- No!

383
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,295
I'm the coach now.

384
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:33,923
- Oh, oh.
- Yeah.

385
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:36,400
Um, h--here's my number.

386
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:40,898
Call me.

387
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:43,237
- I will.
- OK. Bye.

388
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:44,902
Bye.

389
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:50,747
God, I'm so glad
I wrote that book!

390
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,587
According to my syllabus...

391
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:00,717
we should be
well into wrestling by now.

392
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,818
But because of
your lack of focus...

393
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:06,797
we've yet to get past
the fundamentals of kickball.

394
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:08,766
Kreamer, first rule of Bunting.

395
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,825
Um, do--don't--

396
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:13,133
There is no Bunting
in kickball, Kreamer.

397
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:15,639
Set of ten.

398
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:18,973
Henderson, is there a reason
why your shoe is untied?

399
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:21,275
- Um--
- You see on the kickball field...

400
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:23,281
a screw-up like that
can put you in a wheelchair.

401
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:24,873
You'll end up
writing your name...

402
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,281
with a pencil taped
to your head...

403
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:28,286
the rest of your life.
Set of ten.

404
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:33,357
Until you learn
the basics of any sport...

405
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:35,292
you cannot participate in it...

406
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:37,522
let alone excel in it.

407
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:39,655
What are you doing in my class?

408
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:41,256
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to interrupt.

409
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,200
Well, you did. Set of ten.

410
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:45,669
- What?
- It was a joke.

411
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:48,332
- What do you want?
- Maybe I should just come back.

412
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:54,236
Maybe you should spit it out now...

413
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:55,803
so I don't have to
explain to their parents...

414
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:58,077
why they didn't graduate on time.

415
00:21:58,116 --> 00:22:00,016
Well, I've just been feeling...

416
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:02,680
like there's been
some tension between us.

417
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:05,189
Like at dinner,
with the check, and uh...

418
00:22:05,223 --> 00:22:06,986
I guess I just
wanted to say...

419
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:09,994
that some of that
might have been my fault.

420
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:13,663
I'm sorry,
he seems to be in pain.

421
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:14,893
- Who?
- Him!

422
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:18,164
He's fine. Kreamer,
off your knees.

423
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:19,329
Well, he doesn't look fine.

424
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:20,861
Listen, I have
a class to teach...

425
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:23,466
so why don't you get to
your point, if you've got one?

426
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:27,569
I guess I just wanted
to say I'm sorry.

427
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:36,613
And I'm sure for your part
you're a little sorry too.

428
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:39,556
- I don't do sorry.
- What?

429
00:22:39,591 --> 00:22:42,583
Sorry is for criminals and
screw-ups and I'm neither one.

430
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:44,458
Get up, Henderson.

431
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:46,589
Not you, Kreamer.

432
00:22:46,631 --> 00:22:48,724
Now, if you don't mind...

433
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:51,065
these children
are in need of an education.

434
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:54,300
Schwartz, you better
fight your way...

435
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:55,806
past that stutter of yours...

436
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:58,571
and tell me about the pop fly
rule as it pertains to kickball.

437
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,775
W--Well, it--it--

438
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:04,076
It--

439
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:08,044
- When--
- S--s--s--s--s--s--s--set of ten.

440
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:12,750
Fine. My mom wants to date that
asshole, she can go right ahead.

441
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:16,022
Chapter 12. Never interfere
in other people's lives.

442
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:19,224
I don't think
Mr. Woodcock's right for you.

443
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:21,562
- Really?
- Yeah.

444
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,659
He's, um...

445
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:28,171
well, the truth is, he's not
a very nice person, Mom.

446
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:29,798
- He isn't?
- Do you remember when I used to...

447
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:31,866
come home crying
every day after school?

448
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,400
You were so sensitive.

449
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:35,276
That's why you're
so good at what you do.

450
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:36,940
It's not about being sensitive, Mom.

451
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:38,540
He made all of us miserable.

452
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:41,381
Sweetheart, you just
hated anything athletic.

453
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,354
You can't blame Jasper for that.

454
00:23:43,388 --> 00:23:45,185
You don't know him like I do.

455
00:23:45,223 --> 00:23:47,783
And you don't know him like I do.

456
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,361
- He touched me.
- What?

457
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:54,923
OK, that's not true.

458
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:56,900
But he's mean, and he's cruel.

459
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,960
Mom, I'm telling you,
he's still--

460
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:00,733
He's still what?

461
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:03,104
He's still teaching gym.

462
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:05,974
- Oh! What'd you bring me?
- Dinner.

463
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:09,503
Sorry I'm late. Had a long day.
Got a little behind.

464
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:14,178
Wow. Jasper grills
the best beef in Nebraska.

465
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:16,653
Well, I am known for my meat.

466
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:18,451
You only got 2 though,
sweetie.

467
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:22,119
I'm sorry. I guess it
must have slipped my mind.

468
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:26,587
John, you don't mind
running to the store, do you?

469
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:28,258
No.

470
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:31,031
Take your time.

471
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:38,175
"I'm known for my meat!"

472
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,508
"I'm known for my meat."

473
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:43,343
Actually, you're not known
for your meat, Woodcock.

474
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:45,076
You're known for emotionally crippling...

475
00:24:45,116 --> 00:24:47,050
an entire generation of children.

476
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:51,783
Dickhead!

477
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:06,229
Mom.

478
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:07,670
Sweetheart.

479
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:09,537
What's wrong?

480
00:25:09,574 --> 00:25:12,543
Jasper and I are no longer dating.

481
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:15,069
Oh.

482
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:17,980
That's so sad.

483
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:20,246
What happened?

484
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:23,481
We're engaged.

485
00:25:24,122 --> 00:25:25,612
Oh.

486
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:32,425
Have we heard
a congratulations yet?

487
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:35,900
Oh, I think he's in shock.

488
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:37,834
That's so good.

489
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,302
Oh, I'll get it.

490
00:25:39,337 --> 00:25:41,532
I wanna start spreading the news.

491
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,699
Mm.

492
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:48,238
Ha ha ha.

493
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:51,375
Hello?

494
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:56,248
Well, it looks like
I'm gonna be your new dad.

495
00:25:58,523 --> 00:26:01,287
Come on, Johnny.
Stay, help us celebrate.

496
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:03,191
Sorry, Mom.
Book tour emergency.

497
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,889
I have to get to the airport.

498
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:07,455
- You haven't eaten.
- L--I'll grab something on the way.

499
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:08,989
I love you, Mom.
It's great to see you.

500
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:10,524
I love you too.

501
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,230
Farley.

502
00:26:16,107 --> 00:26:17,597
Be safe.

503
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:29,376
Eenie, meanie, miney...

504
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:31,520
Farley.

505
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:36,861
There's no truer test
of the human spirit...

506
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:38,385
than wrestling.

507
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:45,396
That's called a takedown.

508
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:46,961
Get up, Farley.

509
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:48,870
There are many kinds
of takedowns.

510
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:51,774
Today, we're going to
cover some of my favorites.

511
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:54,404
This is called the head and arm.

512
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:57,615
This is called
the single leg sweep.

513
00:26:57,649 --> 00:26:59,310
You step and you sweep!

514
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:02,184
This is called
the fireman's throw.

515
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:05,451
Shoot the crotch,
collapse the hip and sling shot.

516
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:09,651
OK, Farley, you're up.

517
00:27:09,694 --> 00:27:11,321
What?

518
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:13,695
Put me on the mat.

519
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:15,393
Come on. You were paying
attention, weren't you?

520
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:17,060
Let's go.

521
00:27:19,604 --> 00:27:21,128
OK, take me down.

522
00:27:24,275 --> 00:27:27,711
You see there is no reason why
even a little porker like this...

523
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:29,373
shouldn't be able to take me
straight to the mat.

524
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:31,780
I once saw a 4-foot Laotian...

525
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,875
twist a 250lb Swede so hard...

526
00:27:33,918 --> 00:27:35,510
that he mopped
the bleachers with his blood.

527
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:37,350
The only reason I'm still standing...

528
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:39,857
is because you don't believe
in yourself, Farley!

529
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:41,654
You don't believe in yourself!

530
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:44,854
Stop the cab! Stop!

531
00:27:44,896 --> 00:27:47,763
Don't believe in myself, my ass!

532
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:49,664
I invented believing in yourself.

533
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:51,965
No way in hell this guy's gonna
run me out of my own house.

534
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:55,370
Wow. Woodcock's still
plowing your mom, huh?

535
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:57,341
He's marrying her.

536
00:27:57,375 --> 00:28:00,037
Wait, Woodcock's marrying your mom?

537
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:01,636
Ha ha ha. Dudes!

538
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,148
Don't even think about it!

539
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:05,706
Get me a pitcher!

540
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:09,686
What is that, Canadian bacon?

541
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:12,155
So I guess the talk didn't go very well?

542
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:15,091
God, can you imagine my family
with Woodcock in it?

543
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:18,027
A tie for Christmas, Farley?
Set of ten!

544
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:20,224
You didn't eat your vegetables?
Take a lap.

545
00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:23,200
You call that a grandchild?
Rhetorical question, Farley.

546
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:25,361
That sucks.
What are you gonna do?

547
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:27,337
I'm gonna kill Woodcock.

548
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:28,805
- And you're gonna help me.
- John.

549
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,035
I've already got 2 strikes
and I can't be a part of--

550
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:33,271
I'm just venting here. Is that
OK? Is it OK if a guy vents?

551
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:35,609
Yeah, sure, because I thought
you were serious.

552
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:37,547
Ha! I've got it.
I'm gonna break them up.

553
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:39,379
How are you gonna do that?

554
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:42,477
You see, I made a mistake before.

555
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,613
I let him take me out of my game.

556
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:47,648
But this time,
I'm gonna get inside his head...

557
00:28:47,692 --> 00:28:49,387
and spin him like a top.

558
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:54,057
That's good. I don't remember
anything like that in your book.

559
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:55,964
It's not in my book, Nedderman.

560
00:28:58,002 --> 00:28:59,902
- Hello.
- Hey, John.

561
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:02,065
- How's my favorite author?
- Hey, Maggie.

562
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:03,768
Hold on a second.

563
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:06,299
OK, Mommy time's over.

564
00:29:06,344 --> 00:29:07,333
But don't be sad.

565
00:29:07,378 --> 00:29:09,346
Yeah, uh, actually, I gotta
talk to you about that.

566
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:12,349
I know you have some kind of
corn chowder thing on Sunday...

567
00:29:12,383 --> 00:29:14,874
but look, I have amazing news.
Oprah...

568
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:17,353
is seriously considering
your book for the book club.

569
00:29:17,388 --> 00:29:19,652
It's unbelievable. I have you
on a 9:30 flight out...

570
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:21,625
and then I'll meet you on the
connecting flight in St. Louis.

571
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:23,058
Maggie, I can't.

572
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:25,562
- It's a long story but l--I can't.
- Knock it off!

573
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:28,259
- You can't what?
- I can't make it to Chicago.

574
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:30,893
My mom needs me. She's about
to marry the Antichrist.

575
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:34,132
Look, I don't care
if your granny's on fire.

576
00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:35,469
This is Oprah.

577
00:29:35,507 --> 00:29:36,940
She farts on a book...

578
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:38,909
and it magically
sells a million copies.

579
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:40,740
Just get your ass on that plane!

580
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:43,441
- Maggie, please, listen...
- Breaking up this phone call.

581
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:47,713
Get on... plane tomorrow.

582
00:29:47,752 --> 00:29:50,050
Hey! Where are you going?

583
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:52,955
W--Wait! Tell me more about your wife!

584
00:29:57,595 --> 00:29:59,119
Mom?

585
00:30:02,233 --> 00:30:05,532
See, I made a mistake before.
I let him take me off my game.

586
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:08,300
But this time I'm gonna get
inside his head...

587
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:09,704
and spin him like a top.

588
00:30:10,608 --> 00:30:12,337
Spin him like a top.

589
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:14,208
- Spin him like...
- Tickle machine!

590
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:16,679
No, no, no!
Not a tickle machine. No!

591
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:19,342
Oh, oh, stop it!

592
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:22,217
Oh, Jasper, mind--

593
00:30:24,689 --> 00:30:26,884
Who was that?
I think someone's in the house.

594
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:29,018
- Don't worry, I got it.
- Be careful.

595
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:34,055
Oh, shit!

596
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:38,264
No, no! Oh! Ow! Ow!

597
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:40,703
Ow, it's me! It's me! It's John!

598
00:30:40,738 --> 00:30:43,468
Stop! Ow! Stop! It's John, man!

599
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:46,204
- Oh! Johnny!
- What the hell, Woodcock?

600
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:48,474
Well, it was dark.
Instinct took over.

601
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,242
What about when I said,
"It's me! It's John!"

602
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:52,875
John's a very common name.
There could be a burglar named John.

603
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:55,044
What burglar shouts out
his own name?

604
00:30:55,086 --> 00:30:58,317
I'm sure it was an accident,
sweetie. L--um--

605
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:00,085
Honey, I thought you were in danger.

606
00:31:00,124 --> 00:31:01,955
Oh.

607
00:31:01,993 --> 00:31:04,359
Are you all right?

608
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:06,192
Yeah, I'm fine.

609
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:08,199
Well, uh, J--John,
what are you doing here?

610
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:09,495
I thought about it...

611
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,058
and I just didn't want
to disappoint you, Mom.

612
00:31:11,102 --> 00:31:14,697
Aw, that is so sweet.

613
00:31:14,739 --> 00:31:17,606
- Are you sure you're all right?
- Yeah, I'm great.

614
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:20,076
All right, well, then, um...

615
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:22,636
- we'll see you in the morning.
- Great.

616
00:31:23,314 --> 00:31:24,804
Come on, Jasper.

617
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:27,742
Farley.

618
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:15,356
So you really didn't know
it was me last night?

619
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,697
Well, that's what happens...

620
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:18,759
when you go sneaking around
someone else's house.

621
00:32:18,803 --> 00:32:20,270
What do you mean,
someone else's house?

622
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:21,795
Well, last time I checked, chief...

623
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:23,136
you don't live here anymore.

624
00:32:23,174 --> 00:32:25,005
That's not the point.

625
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:51,762
- Morning. Oh, no, sweetheart. Oh, my God.
- Sorry.

626
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:54,294
That is so rude. Don't do that.

627
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:55,738
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

628
00:32:55,773 --> 00:32:57,707
- I love you.
- Oh, thank you.

629
00:32:57,742 --> 00:32:59,733
Oh, I love you too.

630
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:02,109
- I love you so much.
- Aww. Thank you.

631
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:03,943
He's the best.

632
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,814
Well, if it isn't
the future Mrs. Woodcock.

633
00:33:06,851 --> 00:33:08,785
Aww.

634
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:12,654
Mmmmm. Mmmmmm.

635
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:14,689
Mmmm! Ha ha!

636
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:17,661
Hey, Jasper. How about we spend
the day together?

637
00:33:17,695 --> 00:33:19,356
Get to know each other better,
you know?

638
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:22,798
- What a great idea.
- Yeah.

639
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:26,802
Actually, I have a lot
on my plate today, John.

640
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,500
Oh, come on. We'll have fun.

641
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:32,338
- Mmm!
- I'll take a rain check.

642
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:33,674
Honey.

643
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,309
I'm glad we're doing this.

644
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:38,815
Getting to know each other better...

645
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,477
talking things out.

646
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:42,918
Conversation leads
to inspiration, right?

647
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,790
That's from my book.

648
00:33:46,824 --> 00:33:49,349
Ah, I'll get you a copy.

649
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:53,694
Look, I love my mom.
We're very, very close.

650
00:33:53,731 --> 00:33:55,722
Not in a weird way, of course.
Just close.

651
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:57,166
Listen, we could be pals.

652
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:59,533
We could be guys
that sit and watch foot--

653
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:02,801
...hanging loose at the gym.
To me, this is what life is about.

654
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,434
Now, I'm not saying there's
a problem here. I don't judge.

655
00:34:05,476 --> 00:34:07,535
You guys have only known
each other 5 months.

656
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:10,308
You've got your whole life
ahead of you. You could be kids.

657
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:12,509
I don't know what you guys
like to do...

658
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,575
but it's just
that's--that's what's important.

659
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:17,110
I'm just trying to tell you,
don't rush, OK?

660
00:34:17,155 --> 00:34:19,282
Don't rush your life.

661
00:34:19,323 --> 00:34:21,086
You know?

662
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,653
Running your mouth
doesn't count as exercise.

663
00:34:24,695 --> 00:34:26,424
You gonna work out or what?

664
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:17,007
I think you'll survive.

665
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:18,845
You're not showering?

666
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:21,147
No, no. I'm good.

667
00:35:21,185 --> 00:35:22,709
This is not France, Farley.

668
00:35:22,753 --> 00:35:24,345
Maybe you don't mind smelling
like a nut sack all day...

669
00:35:24,388 --> 00:35:26,515
but I gotta be in the car with you.

670
00:35:26,557 --> 00:35:29,958
There are kids in Africa
who'd kill for a shower.

671
00:35:31,028 --> 00:35:32,791
Come on, Farley. Move it.

672
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:35,688
You called me Farley.

673
00:35:35,733 --> 00:35:38,167
You used to call me that
when I was in your class.

674
00:35:38,202 --> 00:35:40,397
It's your name, isn't it?

675
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:42,303
You really don't remember me?

676
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,035
Well, with your innate athletic ability...

677
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:45,269
it's hard to believe, huh?

678
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:47,140
Do you remember what--

679
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:49,078
Simply rub the solution on your teeth...

680
00:35:49,113 --> 00:35:51,206
wait a few moments and then rinse.

681
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:55,947
- Morning, boys.
- Jasper, you old side-winder.

682
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,477
Come to get your ears lowered?

683
00:35:57,522 --> 00:35:59,285
Hey, you look like you could stand...

684
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:01,814
to have a little taken
off the top, you damn hippy.

685
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:03,224
Well, looks like you could stand...

686
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:05,889
to have a little taken off the
middle, you fat son of a bitch.

687
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:07,830
Ha ha ha!

688
00:36:07,865 --> 00:36:10,857
Hee hee hee.

689
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:13,200
You got an appointment?

690
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:15,603
- No, sir. I'm with him.
- Sit down, Farley.

691
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,699
God knows
you could use a little trim.

692
00:36:17,742 --> 00:36:19,004
- Ha ha ha!
- I don't know, Jasper.

693
00:36:19,043 --> 00:36:21,603
You think that boy
even knows what trim is?

694
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:23,637
Ha ha ha!

695
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:25,478
Sit down, Huckleberry.

696
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:28,849
- Maybe clean up the back a little bit.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

697
00:36:28,886 --> 00:36:32,447
So, Jasper.
How's that hell cat of yours doing?

698
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:35,152
- Yeah, she's keeping me young.
- Yes, she is.

699
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:37,161
- In the sack.
- Ha!

700
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:40,528
Yeah, well, I'm gonna make
an honest woman out of her.

701
00:36:40,565 --> 00:36:42,396
Thought you woulda learned
the first time.

702
00:36:42,433 --> 00:36:44,924
Yeah, guess not.

703
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:46,664
You never told me
you were married before.

704
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:49,673
Yeah, well, I never told you about
my kidney stones either. So what?

705
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:53,873
Whoa! What are you doing?

706
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:56,846
Well, don't have a hissy fit, Nancy!

707
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:59,247
It's just a pair of clippers.

708
00:37:03,754 --> 00:37:06,052
You knew they were gonna do that.

709
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:08,081
If you didn't want a haircut
you didn't have to get one.

710
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:10,116
This is not Russia.

711
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:22,000
- You're late, you fairy!
- How you doing, Dad?

712
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:25,065
All I do all day is watch <i>Judge</i>
<i>Joe Brown</i> and piss myself.

713
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:26,804
How the hell
do you think I'm doing?

714
00:37:26,844 --> 00:37:29,039
Wait, you have a father?

715
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,707
Yes, Farley, I'm not Jesus.

716
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:34,445
- Who is this genius?
- It's, uh, Beverly's kid.

717
00:37:34,485 --> 00:37:35,816
Looks like he got a little retard in him.

718
00:37:35,853 --> 00:37:37,047
Are you simple, boy?

719
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,885
- Ha ha ha.
- So, Dad...

720
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:41,721
- I'm getting married.
- Again?

721
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:42,783
So--Yes.

722
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:44,761
Didn't you screw that up enough
the first time?

723
00:37:44,795 --> 00:37:48,424
I'll give it 6 months. Oh, I'll
outlive this marriage. And you!

724
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:52,334
How down on her luck must your
momma be to marry a gym teacher?

725
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:55,999
She knows that he plays
hopscotch for a living, right?

726
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,133
- You think I'm funny, boy?
- No.

727
00:37:58,175 --> 00:38:00,109
- You want to wrestle me?
- Uh, no, thank you.

728
00:38:00,144 --> 00:38:01,839
Come on, wrestle an old man!

729
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:03,312
- Dad--
- Come on, cream puff!

730
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:06,578
My legs are as useless
as your little pecker, but come on!

731
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,608
- Dad, Dad--
- Come on!

732
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:11,315
I'm going to teach my class now.
Do you want to go to the pool?

733
00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:15,018
Water sports is
for girls and sodomites!

734
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:16,048
Sodomites.

735
00:38:16,093 --> 00:38:18,027
OK, I'll see you later, Dad.

736
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:20,758
- Well, it was a pleasure.
- Beat it, fruitcake!

737
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:23,494
He seems like a really nice guy.

738
00:38:23,534 --> 00:38:25,900
You want a shoe up your ass, Farley?

739
00:38:25,936 --> 00:38:27,028
No.

740
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:30,834
Robinson, go dump a bedpan.

741
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,779
OK, let's move it.

742
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:43,314
Get those arms up!

743
00:38:44,522 --> 00:38:46,854
Where's Palumbo?

744
00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:49,621
Palumbo, are you crippled and deaf?

745
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,093
Into the pool!

746
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,658
Palumbo, don't push me.

747
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:58,100
I think his hearing aid
is on the fritz.

748
00:38:58,135 --> 00:38:59,966
I didn't ask you, did I, Weaver?

749
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,164
Well, no, I guess not.

750
00:39:01,205 --> 00:39:03,469
Rhetorical question, Weaver.
Take a lap.

751
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:05,975
Oh. I was just trying to help!

752
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,910
Don't you think you're being
a little harsh with them?

753
00:39:07,945 --> 00:39:10,004
They're just old, Farley.
They're not pathetic.

754
00:39:10,047 --> 00:39:11,708
They enjoy a challenge.

755
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:16,043
Move those legs.

756
00:39:17,555 --> 00:39:19,819
I'm not gonna ask you again, Palumbo.

757
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:21,688
Lose the attitude.

758
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:24,126
Oh, you think this is funny?

759
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:26,220
All right, that's it, Palumbo.
It's go time.

760
00:39:26,263 --> 00:39:27,252
What the--

761
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:28,731
And Platts, don't think
I'm not watching you.

762
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:31,530
You're not the first person
in the world to get a hip replacement.

763
00:39:31,569 --> 00:39:33,867
Pick up the pace!

764
00:39:33,904 --> 00:39:36,270
OK, Palumbo,
this is your last chance.

765
00:39:38,576 --> 00:39:40,441
Oh, really? OK,
we'll do it your way, then.

766
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:42,605
- Whoa, whoa--
- Sink or swim, old man.

767
00:39:42,646 --> 00:39:44,841
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! No, no, no!
- Sink or swim!

768
00:39:46,283 --> 00:39:47,682
Jesus, are you insane?

769
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:49,208
He doesn't need your help, Farley.

770
00:39:49,253 --> 00:39:51,084
What the hell, man? Aah!

771
00:39:57,161 --> 00:39:59,152
Sir, it's all right.
I'm trying to help you.

772
00:39:59,196 --> 00:40:02,188
I'm trying to save your life!

773
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,860
Oh!

774
00:40:19,116 --> 00:40:20,310
Hm.

775
00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:30,221
Jackass!

776
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:34,823
Nice job, Scardusio.
Did you get any tongue?

777
00:40:34,865 --> 00:40:37,459
No, but I get better suction
without the choppers.

778
00:40:37,501 --> 00:40:39,230
Makes sense.

779
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:41,928
Oh!

780
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,635
Come on, Farley, let's saddle up.

781
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:50,237
I'm waiting for my clothes to dry.

782
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:54,615
- Hello?
- Hey, John.

783
00:40:54,652 --> 00:40:56,950
I'm on an airplane heading for Chicago.

784
00:40:56,987 --> 00:40:58,818
And you'll never guess
who's sitting next to me.

785
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:00,653
- Who?
- Nobody!

786
00:41:00,691 --> 00:41:03,489
Now where is your ass
and why isn't it in seat 2A?

787
00:41:04,228 --> 00:41:06,093
Man, just hold on a second.
I got another call.

788
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,859
- Hello?
- I got your message, dude.

789
00:41:07,898 --> 00:41:11,061
- What's going on?
- Hey. Hold on.

790
00:41:11,101 --> 00:41:14,036
You know, Mr. Woodcock,
I'm just gonna get myself home.

791
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:17,006
Suit yourself, Farley.
Just get some pants on.

792
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:18,975
This is not Miami.

793
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,735
Suddenly it makes sense.

794
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:26,708
Nedderman, Woodcock's
been married before.

795
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:28,513
Now, I need you to find out
who she is...

796
00:41:28,552 --> 00:41:29,712
and then pick me up at Alterman's.

797
00:41:29,753 --> 00:41:31,983
Right. The nursing home?

798
00:41:32,022 --> 00:41:33,751
Yeah, and bring me some underwear.

799
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:35,554
Some of mine?

800
00:41:35,593 --> 00:41:37,527
- Listen, Maggie.
- Hello?

801
00:41:37,561 --> 00:41:39,153
Everything's going to shit
right now, OK?

802
00:41:39,196 --> 00:41:40,185
I'm sorry. I'll call you tomorrow.

803
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:42,028
No, John, don't hang--

804
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:43,499
Asshole!

805
00:41:45,402 --> 00:41:48,667
Excuse me. Hi.
Could I get a real bottle, please?

806
00:41:48,706 --> 00:41:50,970
I'm an alcoholic, not a Barbie doll.

807
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,175
What happened to your head?

808
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:57,305
Just drive, Nedderman.

809
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:01,913
Her name is Sally Jensen.

810
00:42:01,952 --> 00:42:04,182
Oh, good work!
Let's go see her right now.

811
00:42:04,221 --> 00:42:05,688
Why?

812
00:42:05,723 --> 00:42:08,089
Well, think about it, Nedderman.

813
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:10,719
Who's more likely to have dirt
on Woodcock than his ex-wife?

814
00:42:10,761 --> 00:42:13,252
But in your book don't you say...

815
00:42:13,297 --> 00:42:15,492
digging up the past
muddies up the present?

816
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,433
Yes, I do...

817
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:18,958
but that's only true if the past...

818
00:42:19,003 --> 00:42:20,595
doesn't actually affect the present.

819
00:42:20,638 --> 00:42:22,503
Think about it, Nedderman.

820
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,633
If I can learn something
about Woodcock's past...

821
00:42:24,675 --> 00:42:28,111
that'll save my mom from future
heartache in the future...

822
00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:29,612
then I don't really have a choice...

823
00:42:29,647 --> 00:42:31,376
but to address it
in the present, right?

824
00:42:31,415 --> 00:42:33,406
L--Guess not.

825
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:35,350
Exactly.

826
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:40,552
Who is that?

827
00:42:40,591 --> 00:42:42,650
That's my brother, Clark.

828
00:42:48,032 --> 00:42:50,330
There it is.

829
00:42:50,367 --> 00:42:52,597
Home of the former Mrs. Woodcock.

830
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:54,735
All right. I'm going in.

831
00:42:54,772 --> 00:42:57,832
Nedderman, I need you
to find more dirt on Woodcock, all right?

832
00:42:57,875 --> 00:43:01,868
Think outside the box.
See the challenge, focus on it...

833
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:04,642
visualize, attack it
and then reuse it, OK?

834
00:43:04,682 --> 00:43:07,242
- You got me?
- L--I won't let you down, John. I promise.

835
00:43:07,284 --> 00:43:10,276
- Thanks for the underwear.
- Sorry if they're big.

836
00:43:14,792 --> 00:43:16,919
Hey, see if she has a pool!

837
00:43:16,961 --> 00:43:20,021
Or a koi pond!

838
00:43:20,064 --> 00:43:21,691
A fish tank?

839
00:43:21,732 --> 00:43:23,222
Nedderman.

840
00:43:26,503 --> 00:43:28,266
Sally Jensen?

841
00:43:29,573 --> 00:43:31,200
Who are you?

842
00:43:31,241 --> 00:43:33,971
Um, I'm John Farley.

843
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:36,807
Can I get you something to drink?

844
00:43:36,847 --> 00:43:39,748
I think I have a clean glass
around here somewhere.

845
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:41,683
No, I'm good, thanks.

846
00:43:47,024 --> 00:43:49,049
I love your book.

847
00:43:49,093 --> 00:43:51,584
Turned my life around.

848
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:55,562
Must be my lucky day.

849
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:58,864
Hometown hero in the flesh
right here in my own living room.

850
00:44:00,037 --> 00:44:02,005
What do you want?

851
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:05,600
I'm doing research...
for my next book.

852
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:08,339
If you don't mind my asking,
why did you divorce?

853
00:44:08,379 --> 00:44:10,142
Why do you think?

854
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:11,647
Infidelity.

855
00:44:11,682 --> 00:44:14,913
Over and over again.

856
00:44:14,952 --> 00:44:17,716
Should have broke it off
years earlier, but--

857
00:44:17,755 --> 00:44:19,052
But what?

858
00:44:19,089 --> 00:44:23,788
- The sex was amazing.
- Oh.

859
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:25,818
I'm telling you,
that man knows how to use...

860
00:44:25,863 --> 00:44:27,490
what the good Lord gave him.

861
00:44:27,531 --> 00:44:29,556
Oh, right. Thanks for that.

862
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:33,195
Once, I actually blacked out.

863
00:44:33,237 --> 00:44:38,072
Can you imagine blacking out
from sheer pleasure?

864
00:44:38,108 --> 00:44:42,772
Once I spoke Portuguese
and I don't even know the language.

865
00:44:42,813 --> 00:44:45,509
- OK, I think that's enough.
- Ha ha ha.

866
00:44:45,549 --> 00:44:47,642
Um, this has been very helpful...

867
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:49,346
and disturbing all at the same time.

868
00:44:49,386 --> 00:44:52,913
Why? Do you know Jasper?

869
00:44:52,956 --> 00:44:56,357
Actually I do. Uh, he was
a teacher of mine, years ago.

870
00:44:56,393 --> 00:44:58,987
And, uh, he's marrying my mom.

871
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:02,294
Saw him last week
at the coffee shop with her.

872
00:45:02,332 --> 00:45:04,732
A big-titted, blonde tramp.

873
00:45:04,768 --> 00:45:07,828
Sorry. No offense.

874
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:10,999
She looks awfully young
to be your mom.

875
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:13,202
- He's cheating on her.
- What?

876
00:45:13,243 --> 00:45:15,939
Yup. He cheated on his ex-wife.
That's why they got divorced.

877
00:45:15,979 --> 00:45:17,003
Now he's doing the same thing
to my mom...

878
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:20,107
with some big-titted, blonde tramp.

879
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:22,710
So that's great. So--So we just
gotta tell your mom now.

880
00:45:23,353 --> 00:45:24,820
No, I can't just tell her.

881
00:45:24,855 --> 00:45:26,220
She doesn't listen to me
when it comes to Woodcock.

882
00:45:26,256 --> 00:45:28,019
- We need proof.
- No problem.

883
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:29,923
We've been working on
some killer stuff on our end.

884
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,724
Good. Meet me at my place
as soon as possible.

885
00:45:36,934 --> 00:45:39,129
You wanted evidence, you got it.

886
00:45:39,169 --> 00:45:40,693
It may not prove Woodcock's cheating...

887
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:42,569
but it does prove he's a huge dick.

888
00:45:42,606 --> 00:45:44,540
What happened to his eye?

889
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:47,373
Look, don't worry about him.
He's fine.

890
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:51,643
When she sees this, man,
she'll come to her senses.

891
00:45:51,682 --> 00:45:55,118
No, Mr. Woodcock.
Please don't hurt me again.

892
00:45:55,152 --> 00:45:56,881
Aah!

893
00:45:58,188 --> 00:46:00,247
Ha ha ha. Well?

894
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:02,815
You threw a chair at your brother?

895
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:04,953
Weren't you watching?

896
00:46:04,995 --> 00:46:06,860
It wasn't me that threw
the chair at him...

897
00:46:06,897 --> 00:46:08,728
it was Woodcock
that threw the chair.

898
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:10,597
He said Woodcock.
Woodcock threw that chair!

899
00:46:10,634 --> 00:46:13,000
Honey? Hi, are you home?

900
00:46:13,036 --> 00:46:16,972
Oh, look, that's so nice.
You've got some friends over.

901
00:46:17,007 --> 00:46:18,406
Hi, I'm John's mom.

902
00:46:21,411 --> 00:46:23,402
Nedderman.

903
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:25,847
Nedderman.

904
00:46:25,883 --> 00:46:28,681
You remember him?
We were in the same class.

905
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:31,153
What happened to your head?

906
00:46:31,188 --> 00:46:32,883
Woodcock doesn't deserve her.

907
00:46:32,923 --> 00:46:35,187
Farley's mom is hot.
I mean, yes, she's old and shit...

908
00:46:35,225 --> 00:46:37,159
but God, I just want
to stick my face...

909
00:46:37,194 --> 00:46:40,391
between those great old titties
and go, "Brrrrrrr!

910
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:44,161
"Brrrrr!
Brrrrrrrr! Brrrrrrrrr!"

911
00:46:44,201 --> 00:46:45,930
Nedderman, turn it off.

912
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:48,733
...titties and go, "Brrrrrrr!"

913
00:46:49,673 --> 00:46:50,935
Big old--big old titties--

914
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:52,407
Big old titties--

915
00:46:52,442 --> 00:46:53,966
- Jasper.
- Brrrrrrrrr!

916
00:46:54,011 --> 00:46:55,171
Jasper!

917
00:46:56,980 --> 00:47:00,177
I meant that in the most
respectful way possible.

918
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,317
Run!

919
00:47:05,923 --> 00:47:07,618
Mrs. Farley!

920
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:09,523
You people are sick, Farley.

921
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:12,393
- I barely know those guys, Mom.
- OK--

922
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:17,890
Well--Let's just pretend
that never happened.

923
00:47:20,304 --> 00:47:22,898
Johnny, are you all right?

924
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:27,877
Jasper said that he thought
you seemed upset today.

925
00:47:27,911 --> 00:47:31,677
Oh! He did? Oh.

926
00:47:31,715 --> 00:47:35,617
Sweetie, look, I know
that it's not easy for you...

927
00:47:35,652 --> 00:47:37,984
to have a new man in our house.

928
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:39,579
But we're getting married...

929
00:47:39,623 --> 00:47:41,386
and he's gonna be part of our family.

930
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:47,626
All I want is for
just you two to get along.

931
00:47:47,664 --> 00:47:50,394
Is that asking too much?

932
00:47:50,434 --> 00:47:51,924
Could you try?

933
00:47:51,969 --> 00:47:53,493
For me?

934
00:47:55,172 --> 00:47:56,730
OK.

935
00:47:56,773 --> 00:47:59,173
- I love you, Mom.
- Oh, sweetie. I love you too.

936
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:02,042
- Thank you. Oh!
- Sorry.

937
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:04,411
Let's go to Cornival.
Let's have a good time tonight.

938
00:48:04,448 --> 00:48:06,780
Great. We'll have a great night.
All of us.

939
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:27,837
# My loves have some stories... #

940
00:48:29,172 --> 00:48:31,003
- Come on, tell me.
- No, forget it.

941
00:48:31,041 --> 00:48:32,668
No, I want to know!

942
00:48:32,709 --> 00:48:35,303
- Look, I'm embarrassed, OK?
- Oh!

943
00:48:35,345 --> 00:48:37,813
John, you can't just start
saying something and then stop.

944
00:48:37,848 --> 00:48:40,544
- Come on.
- Never mind, never mind.

945
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:42,745
John.

946
00:48:42,786 --> 00:48:44,981
Oh, all right. Um...

947
00:48:45,022 --> 00:48:49,982
I've had the biggest crush
on you since the 7th grade.

948
00:48:50,027 --> 00:48:54,259
Ha ha ha. And here we are!

949
00:48:54,298 --> 00:48:56,357
Yeah, here we are.

950
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,231
The cornival.

951
00:48:58,268 --> 00:49:01,237
- I'm glad you called.
- Yeah, me too.

952
00:49:02,506 --> 00:49:05,407
- Jasper! Let me do it.
- Lift it up. Keep it up high.

953
00:49:06,877 --> 00:49:08,606
Oh! Now you're cheating!

954
00:49:08,645 --> 00:49:12,775
Aw. You have to admit,
they're kind of cute together.

955
00:49:12,816 --> 00:49:14,511
You're kidding?

956
00:49:14,551 --> 00:49:17,645
No, your mom is beautiful.

957
00:49:17,688 --> 00:49:21,021
And Woodcock's kinda sexy,
you know.

958
00:49:21,058 --> 00:49:23,322
- Mr. Woodcock?
- Yeah.

959
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:27,319
I mean, just, I don't know,
the way he--he carries himself.

960
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:29,457
- What?
- There's just something about him.

961
00:49:29,499 --> 00:49:32,263
It's like this bravado
and... I don't know.

962
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:34,634
All the girls at school love him.
I mean, he's hilarious.

963
00:49:34,671 --> 00:49:36,332
One time he grabbed me by my--

964
00:49:36,373 --> 00:49:37,931
He coxes them
in the teachers' lounge.

965
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:40,307
He has this little game
that we play with his whistle.

966
00:49:40,344 --> 00:49:44,280
Actually, I've always kinda
had a crush on Woodcock.

967
00:49:46,883 --> 00:49:49,977
Wow! You--you wanna go?

968
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:51,544
Yeah, sure.

969
00:49:51,588 --> 00:49:53,556
That's cool, right?
You're not--you're not gonna eat that.

970
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,595
Hey, guys. How are you doing?

971
00:49:59,629 --> 00:50:01,995
Oh, good. I'm done.

972
00:50:02,032 --> 00:50:04,933
Um, why don't you two
play a little bit, huh?

973
00:50:04,968 --> 00:50:07,027
- I thought you wanted to win a panda.
- Oh, it's all right.

974
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:09,129
- I'll win you a panda, Mom.
- Oh!

975
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:12,005
- Sure you brought enough cash?
- Jasper.

976
00:50:12,042 --> 00:50:15,910
OK, so let's go get some cotton
candy and let the boys play.

977
00:50:15,946 --> 00:50:17,504
- Yeah.
- Good luck.

978
00:50:17,547 --> 00:50:19,947
Win me a puppy.

979
00:50:19,983 --> 00:50:22,315
- OK, Woodcock.
- Looks like we got a challenge.

980
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:24,479
- Let's play.
- Good luck, young man.

981
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:27,319
There you go, sir. Here we go!

982
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:29,291
Ha! Harder than it looks!

983
00:50:29,326 --> 00:50:31,487
Hey, nice shot!

984
00:50:32,229 --> 00:50:34,129
Try again, kid.

985
00:50:34,164 --> 00:50:36,860
We got a shooter, folks!

986
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:39,334
- Oh!
- Nice one, Farley.

987
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:41,860
- Damn it!
- Whoo!

988
00:50:41,905 --> 00:50:43,372
That's a winner right there.

989
00:50:43,407 --> 00:50:46,467
Looks like a panda to me, sir.
Nice job.

990
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:50,276
All right, kid.
Everybody's a winner. Ha ha ha!

991
00:50:51,615 --> 00:50:54,106
I've seen better shooting
at the special Olympics.

992
00:50:54,151 --> 00:50:57,552
- Basketball's not really my game.
- Really?

993
00:50:57,587 --> 00:50:59,919
What is your game?
Whac A Mole?

994
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:09,596
Stupid game!

995
00:51:09,633 --> 00:51:13,262
I just wanna warn you, Farley.
I'm a card-carrying member of the N.R.A.

996
00:51:13,303 --> 00:51:15,464
You don't have a prayer.

997
00:51:15,505 --> 00:51:17,370
Ready, gentlemen!

998
00:51:27,951 --> 00:51:30,886
- We have a winner!
- Don't be a sore loser.

999
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:32,718
I'm telling you,
my gun was messed up.

1000
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:34,883
It's never the gun, Farley,
it's always the hunter.

1001
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:37,325
"Corn-eating Corntest."

1002
00:51:38,829 --> 00:51:40,729
Oh, it's on.

1003
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:44,131
You're going down, Woodcock.

1004
00:51:44,167 --> 00:51:45,998
You must like
getting spanked, Farley.

1005
00:51:46,036 --> 00:51:48,027
- I guess it runs in the family.
- Here you go, boys.

1006
00:51:48,071 --> 00:51:49,129
Begin!

1007
00:51:49,172 --> 00:51:51,936
Oh, I shoulda known
that you'd be here.

1008
00:51:51,975 --> 00:51:55,968
You know, Johnny won this competition
what, 6 times in a row?

1009
00:51:56,012 --> 00:51:57,980
- 7. 7.
- When he was little. 7 times!

1010
00:51:58,014 --> 00:51:59,948
And against adults, too!

1011
00:51:59,983 --> 00:52:02,918
And here we go, corn-testants!
And may the best--

1012
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:05,649
Oh, they're getting ready to go
so we'll just go over here.

1013
00:52:05,689 --> 00:52:08,453
- Remember, half cobs do not count.
- Good luck!

1014
00:52:08,492 --> 00:52:11,052
See you, girls.
That's funny, Farley.

1015
00:52:11,094 --> 00:52:13,119
I didn't know fat kids
ate their vegetables.

1016
00:52:13,163 --> 00:52:14,994
Save it for the corn-test, old man.

1017
00:52:15,031 --> 00:52:16,464
- Ready for this?
- Yes!

1018
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,695
Are the corn-testants ready for this?

1019
00:52:18,735 --> 00:52:22,796
If you are ready, then get set...

1020
00:52:24,674 --> 00:52:26,938
There they go,
ladies and gentlemen...

1021
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:28,535
Iook at them gnaw on that corn!

1022
00:52:28,578 --> 00:52:30,603
Do you see those teeth?

1023
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:35,808
Half a cob doesn't count.

1024
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:40,456
Pretty good there, Farley?

1025
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:42,321
Keep it going. Look there.
Look at them go.

1026
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:43,986
You want to pace yourself, Farley.

1027
00:52:44,027 --> 00:52:46,621
Just let go, Woodcock.

1028
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:50,997
Great tension. Hey, hey, keep your hand off
your neighbor's cob!

1029
00:52:51,034 --> 00:52:53,195
Penalty!

1030
00:52:53,236 --> 00:52:55,033
All right, here we go.
Keep chewing that corn!

1031
00:52:56,873 --> 00:52:57,965
10 seconds left!

1032
00:52:58,008 --> 00:52:59,839
Coming down to the end now.

1033
00:52:59,876 --> 00:53:04,472
5, 4, 3...

1034
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:06,414
2, 1!

1035
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:23,431
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a winner!

1036
00:53:23,466 --> 00:53:26,594
And that winner is, again...

1037
00:53:26,636 --> 00:53:28,604
- John Farley!
- Whoo!

1038
00:53:28,638 --> 00:53:34,042
Ha ha ha! Yes! Whoo!
You got beat, sweetheart!

1039
00:53:34,077 --> 00:53:36,671
Whoo! Whoo!

1040
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:40,114
Whooooooo-hoo-hoo!
Whoo-whoo-whoo! Ha ha ha!

1041
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:44,587
Oh, yeah, baby! Whoo!
Whooo-hoo-hoo!

1042
00:53:44,621 --> 00:53:46,953
I'm the big winner. I win!

1043
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:50,050
I'm the big winner
'cause this is my house, bitch!

1044
00:53:50,093 --> 00:53:52,687
- Whoo-hoo!
- John Michael Farley!

1045
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:55,061
What has come over you?

1046
00:53:58,235 --> 00:53:59,702
Ugh!

1047
00:54:01,037 --> 00:54:04,438
It's OK, Farley.
I know how to cheer her up.

1048
00:54:04,474 --> 00:54:07,671
Do me a favor. Snag my bears.

1049
00:54:07,711 --> 00:54:11,238
Well, John, you really...
ate that corn.

1050
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:17,417
Thanks.

1051
00:54:36,573 --> 00:54:37,972
- Hello?
- Wake up!

1052
00:54:38,008 --> 00:54:40,033
I got something to show you.

1053
00:54:40,076 --> 00:54:42,010
Nedderman? What's going on?

1054
00:54:42,045 --> 00:54:43,706
And at 0800 hours...

1055
00:54:43,747 --> 00:54:45,510
a blonde chick
rolled up in that car...

1056
00:54:45,548 --> 00:54:46,981
and went into Woodcock's house.

1057
00:54:47,017 --> 00:54:51,647
How long you been
staking out his house?

1058
00:54:51,688 --> 00:54:53,622
17, 18 hours.

1059
00:54:56,192 --> 00:54:58,285
Hey... there she is!

1060
00:54:58,328 --> 00:55:02,321
- What?
- Oh, that son of a bitch!

1061
00:55:02,365 --> 00:55:04,162
What kind of asshole
would cheat on his wife...

1062
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,633
before he's even married?

1063
00:55:05,669 --> 00:55:07,967
The same kind of asshole that
would make a kid run laps...

1064
00:55:08,004 --> 00:55:09,767
until his nipples bleed.

1065
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:11,103
Shit!

1066
00:55:20,917 --> 00:55:23,477
Now, then.
We gotta go in there.

1067
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:26,648
Oh, bro, staking out
the guy's place is one thing...

1068
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:28,248
but breaking and entering,
that's another.

1069
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:30,657
Nedderman,
we need concrete proof.

1070
00:55:30,694 --> 00:55:31,991
John, I haven't shit my pants...

1071
00:55:32,028 --> 00:55:33,791
since the balance beam
in the 7th grade.

1072
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:36,196
L--l--I'd like to keep it that way.

1073
00:55:36,232 --> 00:55:37,893
And what about your book,
chapter 14?

1074
00:55:37,934 --> 00:55:40,528
"Respect other people's boundaries."

1075
00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:42,197
Wait, do you have the book with you?

1076
00:55:42,238 --> 00:55:43,535
Yeah.

1077
00:55:43,573 --> 00:55:44,733
Oh, great.

1078
00:55:46,076 --> 00:55:48,374
Let me see this. See.

1079
00:55:51,214 --> 00:55:54,149
Forget the book! Just forget it!

1080
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:57,448
I can't take this book anymore!

1081
00:55:57,487 --> 00:56:00,752
'Cause every 30 seconds you're
in my ear, like, wah, wah, wah!

1082
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:04,021
I can't do it, OK?
I wrote it, I know what's in it!

1083
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:07,029
It's crap! I'm done with it, OK?

1084
00:56:09,232 --> 00:56:10,460
What?

1085
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:12,559
Hey... it's Tracy.

1086
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:15,767
Hey, Tracy.

1087
00:56:15,805 --> 00:56:18,672
- How are you?
- Fine. Um...

1088
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:20,266
listen, John, about last night.

1089
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:23,677
You seem like you're in
a really weird place right now.

1090
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:27,945
Really? No, I feel great.

1091
00:56:27,984 --> 00:56:29,110
I really do.

1092
00:56:29,152 --> 00:56:32,315
Well, maybe you should
just call me...

1093
00:56:32,355 --> 00:56:35,518
when things are
a little more... stable?

1094
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:37,253
I think that'd be best.

1095
00:56:37,293 --> 00:56:39,318
Oh.

1096
00:56:39,362 --> 00:56:41,353
OK, um...

1097
00:56:42,665 --> 00:56:45,634
I respect your feelings
and your decision. L--

1098
00:56:45,668 --> 00:56:47,829
I'm sorry you feel that way.

1099
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:50,863
All right. Well,
take care of yourself, OK?

1100
00:56:52,275 --> 00:56:53,537
Yep, you too.

1101
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:54,975
Bye.

1102
00:56:55,011 --> 00:56:56,342
Bye.

1103
00:57:02,018 --> 00:57:03,417
OK, this is the plan.

1104
00:57:03,453 --> 00:57:04,977
We're gonna break into
Woodcock's place.

1105
00:57:05,021 --> 00:57:06,318
We're gonna plant
your video camera...

1106
00:57:06,356 --> 00:57:07,687
then we're gonna catch him
cheating on my mom...

1107
00:57:07,724 --> 00:57:09,385
and then we're gonna finish
this effing fiasco...

1108
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:11,121
once and for all, OK?

1109
00:57:11,161 --> 00:57:14,460
Right, Clark, give me
the minicam. You're on lookout.

1110
00:57:14,497 --> 00:57:17,159
Anything happens, honk the horn,
you understand me?

1111
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:35,880
Nedderman! It's open.

1112
00:57:46,596 --> 00:57:48,530
What the--

1113
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:53,997
- What are you doing?
- Sor--

1114
00:57:54,037 --> 00:57:55,868
I'm sorry. Sorry.

1115
00:57:55,905 --> 00:57:57,873
- Jesus.
- OK.

1116
00:58:19,929 --> 00:58:21,794
Hello, smoking gun.

1117
00:58:30,406 --> 00:58:32,374
Damn it, Clark!

1118
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:35,407
Oh, shit!

1119
00:58:37,914 --> 00:58:39,472
Nedderman?

1120
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:41,211
Nedderman!

1121
00:58:51,661 --> 00:58:53,595
Jasper, I'm still upset with you.

1122
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:55,894
I know, honey,
but you know how I get...

1123
00:58:55,932 --> 00:58:58,093
- when I don't have you to myself.
- Aah.

1124
00:58:58,134 --> 00:59:00,694
- I just need some... alone time.
- What about me?

1125
00:59:00,737 --> 00:59:03,865
Well, honey, it wouldn't be
alone time without you.

1126
00:59:03,907 --> 00:59:06,205
- You know what I mean!
- Ha ha ha!

1127
00:59:06,242 --> 00:59:09,109
Jasper, you charmer. Oh!

1128
00:59:09,145 --> 00:59:11,978
Mmmmmm!

1129
00:59:12,015 --> 00:59:15,143
Oh, honey. Oh, darling.

1130
00:59:15,184 --> 00:59:16,412
Bad boy!

1131
00:59:19,088 --> 00:59:22,057
- Feel good, baby?
- Yes! Yes!

1132
00:59:22,091 --> 00:59:23,581
Rhetorical question, Beverly!

1133
00:59:23,626 --> 00:59:26,151
- Oh, God! Oh, God!
- Oh, yeah!

1134
00:59:26,195 --> 00:59:28,186
- Feel the love!
- I don't want to black out again.

1135
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:30,096
The finish line's in sight, honey.

1136
00:59:35,438 --> 00:59:37,599
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

1137
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:40,541
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Yes!

1138
00:59:51,187 --> 00:59:53,712
That was way better than
anything on the internet.

1139
01:00:01,731 --> 01:00:03,198
Excuse me,
may I have your attention?

1140
01:00:03,232 --> 01:00:05,996
Uh, if everyone
would, uh... would grab a seat...

1141
01:00:06,035 --> 01:00:07,969
and I get the honorees up on stage...

1142
01:00:08,004 --> 01:00:09,301
we can get started.

1143
01:00:09,339 --> 01:00:12,900
For the past 26 years,
Jasper Woodcock's name...

1144
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:16,742
has been synonymous with
the words "physical education".

1145
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:18,178
Now, before we get
to the presentation...

1146
01:00:18,214 --> 01:00:19,511
let's hear from some of the people...

1147
01:00:19,549 --> 01:00:23,645
whose lives have been touched
by this great man.

1148
01:00:23,686 --> 01:00:25,313
Honey, where were you?

1149
01:00:25,355 --> 01:00:27,585
I thought you were gonna ride
with us. I was worried.

1150
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:30,821
Sorry, Mom.
L--I needed some alone time.

1151
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:32,828
Oh.

1152
01:00:32,862 --> 01:00:37,925
My name is Zoe. And last summer,
my cat Raisins ran away.

1153
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:41,733
That man found her. Her collar
was caught on a fence.

1154
01:00:41,771 --> 01:00:44,899
She was dead from stran--gulation.

1155
01:00:44,941 --> 01:00:46,875
But she's in heaven now.

1156
01:00:46,909 --> 01:00:49,605
Thank you for finding Raisins,
Mr. Woodcock.

1157
01:00:54,384 --> 01:00:55,851
You're kidding me.

1158
01:00:55,885 --> 01:00:57,250
When I was in his class...

1159
01:00:57,286 --> 01:00:59,948
Mr. Woodcock found a brick
of marijuana in my locker.

1160
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:03,550
He could have sent me
to the principal, but no.

1161
01:01:03,593 --> 01:01:05,652
He called the cops.

1162
01:01:05,695 --> 01:01:09,563
And instead of going to
detention I did 6 years in juvi.

1163
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:13,194
Where I found my lord
and savior, Jesus Christ.

1164
01:01:13,236 --> 01:01:14,396
Jesus Christ!

1165
01:01:14,437 --> 01:01:17,804
And I have been
mostly drug-free ever since.

1166
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:21,139
Thank you, Mr. Woodcock.

1167
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:23,611
"Mr. Woodcock is
one of the best teachers.

1168
01:01:23,646 --> 01:01:25,739
"He taught me how to play hard
and never give up.

1169
01:01:25,782 --> 01:01:31,118
"Because of him, I got
a scholarship to play football.

1170
01:01:31,154 --> 01:01:32,917
"In college."

1171
01:01:33,890 --> 01:01:36,552
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Woodcock.

1172
01:01:36,592 --> 01:01:38,150
What the fuck?

1173
01:01:39,062 --> 01:01:41,087
Woodcock never talks down to us.

1174
01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:43,098
He treats us just like everyone else.

1175
01:01:43,132 --> 01:01:45,032
I named my kid after Woodcock.

1176
01:01:45,635 --> 01:01:47,535
Woodcock taught me
how to be a man.

1177
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:49,333
Woodcock taught me
how to be a man.

1178
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:51,499
Woodcock taught me
how to be a man.

1179
01:01:52,241 --> 01:01:53,538
Woodcock taught me CPR.

1180
01:01:53,576 --> 01:01:55,271
- Woodcock saved my life.
- Bullshit!

1181
01:01:55,311 --> 01:01:56,300
- Woodcock--
- Woodcock--

1182
01:01:56,345 --> 01:01:57,334
- Woodcock--
- Woodcock--

1183
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:58,677
Woodcock--

1184
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:00,080
- Woodcock.
- Woodcock.

1185
01:02:00,116 --> 01:02:02,380
Jasper Woodcock.

1186
01:02:02,418 --> 01:02:04,443
Educator of the Year.

1187
01:02:15,765 --> 01:02:17,494
Go, Jasper!

1188
01:02:18,801 --> 01:02:21,099
Thanks a lot. Uh...

1189
01:02:22,371 --> 01:02:24,271
appreciate it.

1190
01:02:29,612 --> 01:02:31,011
Ha ha ha.

1191
01:02:31,047 --> 01:02:33,015
That's, uh--that's good stuff,
Jasper. Thank you.

1192
01:02:33,049 --> 01:02:34,107
Unbelievable!

1193
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:36,983
We have one more award to give out.

1194
01:02:39,889 --> 01:02:42,483
The Corn Cob Key.

1195
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:46,458
Given to those
who go off into the world...

1196
01:02:46,496 --> 01:02:48,987
and make Forest Meadow proud.

1197
01:02:49,031 --> 01:02:50,828
Right.

1198
01:02:50,867 --> 01:02:54,564
Ladies and gentlemen, John Farley!

1199
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:12,378
Ha ha ha.

1200
01:03:15,258 --> 01:03:17,726
Are you guys out of your minds?

1201
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:19,352
Ha ha ha.

1202
01:03:20,396 --> 01:03:23,263
Seriously. Am I the only one...

1203
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:24,527
that thinks that Woodcock's like...

1204
01:03:24,567 --> 01:03:26,194
the biggest asshole on the planet?

1205
01:03:33,376 --> 01:03:34,638
I mean, for 26 years...

1206
01:03:34,677 --> 01:03:37,441
this guy's been pelting children
with basketballs...

1207
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:38,708
at point-blank range.

1208
01:03:38,748 --> 01:03:40,375
And now you're giving him
an award for it?

1209
01:03:40,416 --> 01:03:42,509
- He should be in jail!
- Johnny. Johnny.

1210
01:03:42,552 --> 01:03:45,043
I mean, is there any question
that he strangled this girl's cat?

1211
01:03:45,087 --> 01:03:47,851
What--what was her name,
Raisins? Yeah, you know what?

1212
01:03:47,890 --> 01:03:50,381
Go home, dig up Raisins,
perform an autopsy on him...

1213
01:03:50,426 --> 01:03:52,986
you'll find out
it wasn't an accident.

1214
01:03:53,029 --> 01:03:56,021
Dogs don't strangle cats.
Sadistic gym teachers do.

1215
01:03:58,568 --> 01:03:59,398
OK.

1216
01:03:59,435 --> 01:04:01,596
Somebody put something
in the punch again this year!

1217
01:04:01,637 --> 01:04:03,901
Wait, wait. No, no, I'm serious!

1218
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:06,306
Look, he hates children.

1219
01:04:07,577 --> 01:04:09,442
He killed one of my classmates.

1220
01:04:09,478 --> 01:04:11,878
Yeah, after years of his abuse...

1221
01:04:11,914 --> 01:04:13,347
Trevor Oates took his own life...

1222
01:04:13,382 --> 01:04:15,407
and he died because of Woodcock.

1223
01:04:15,451 --> 01:04:17,681
No, I didn't.

1224
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:22,222
- Oates, I thought you were dead.
- No.

1225
01:04:22,258 --> 01:04:24,556
I had minor surgery a few years back.

1226
01:04:24,594 --> 01:04:27,927
You know, to help with my wheezing.

1227
01:04:29,465 --> 01:04:33,162
Whatever. Oates is alive.
Whoop-di-doo! Who gives a shit?

1228
01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:34,999
- Johnny.
- I'm sorry.

1229
01:04:35,037 --> 01:04:36,766
I'm sorry.
I know you hate to hear that.

1230
01:04:36,806 --> 01:04:38,467
He's not what you think.

1231
01:04:38,507 --> 01:04:40,532
You're brainwashed, people!

1232
01:04:40,576 --> 01:04:43,443
Oh, just ask his ex-wife
right there, Sally Jensen.

1233
01:04:43,479 --> 01:04:44,844
Tell them about all the man whoring...

1234
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:47,349
he did behind your back
when you were married.

1235
01:04:47,383 --> 01:04:49,908
Well, I think most of you know
I cheated on him.

1236
01:04:49,952 --> 01:04:52,250
I'm--I'm sorry. What?
You cheated on him?

1237
01:04:52,288 --> 01:04:55,883
A lot. I couldn't help it.
I was a sex addict.

1238
01:04:55,925 --> 01:04:57,017
Am.

1239
01:04:57,493 --> 01:04:58,983
Uh, was.

1240
01:05:00,363 --> 01:05:01,853
Am. Ha ha ha.

1241
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:03,024
Yeah.

1242
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:04,362
All right, let's go.

1243
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,960
That's enough.
That's enough of that!

1244
01:05:08,471 --> 01:05:10,905
- He's cheating on my mom!
- Johnny, sit down right now.

1245
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:13,306
- That's enough, Farley.
- I'm sorry, Mom.

1246
01:05:13,342 --> 01:05:14,900
You've been sneaking
behind my mom's back...

1247
01:05:14,944 --> 01:05:16,411
with that blonde whore...

1248
01:05:16,445 --> 01:05:19,141
right there, haven't you?

1249
01:05:19,181 --> 01:05:20,910
That's my realtor, you moron.

1250
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:24,044
I was trying to surprise
your mother with a new house.

1251
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:28,079
Well, how come I found
her panties in your bedroom?

1252
01:05:31,994 --> 01:05:34,087
Those are your mother's, Farley.

1253
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:35,961
Mom?

1254
01:05:35,998 --> 01:05:38,831
Yeah. OK, Farley, you and me,
out in the hallway right now.

1255
01:05:38,868 --> 01:05:40,267
Now!

1256
01:05:40,303 --> 01:05:42,271
- Uhh!
- You disrespectful little shit!

1257
01:05:42,305 --> 01:05:45,172
I'm gonna give you a good old-fashioned
Nebraska ass-whipping...

1258
01:05:45,207 --> 01:05:46,435
till you shit yourself.

1259
01:05:46,475 --> 01:05:47,874
Bring it, bro!

1260
01:05:47,910 --> 01:05:49,605
I don't know what I'm gonna
enjoy more tonight...

1261
01:05:49,645 --> 01:05:51,510
kicking your ass
or nailing your mother.

1262
01:05:51,547 --> 01:05:53,276
- Oh!
- Let go of my son, Jasper.

1263
01:05:55,985 --> 01:05:58,783
- Uh, Bev--
- Let go of my son.

1264
01:05:58,821 --> 01:06:00,755
- Bev, l--
- You two are unbelievable.

1265
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:04,317
You won't be civil even though
it hurts and humiliates me.

1266
01:06:15,471 --> 01:06:16,802
Mom!

1267
01:06:26,515 --> 01:06:28,813
Mom, are you OK?

1268
01:06:28,851 --> 01:06:31,411
Go away, John. Leave me alone.

1269
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:38,586
Maggie?

1270
01:06:38,627 --> 01:06:41,323
I have been carting around
your damn luggage since Denver!

1271
01:06:41,364 --> 01:06:44,697
Thanks to you blowing off the most
powerful woman in America...

1272
01:06:44,734 --> 01:06:47,202
Walden Books has canceled
the rest of your appearances.

1273
01:06:47,236 --> 01:06:49,602
- I don't believe this.
- I know.

1274
01:06:49,638 --> 01:06:52,300
If only someone had warned you!

1275
01:06:52,341 --> 01:06:54,571
- So it's over.
- No, not exactly.

1276
01:06:54,610 --> 01:06:56,601
When you hear about this,
you're gonna want to take me...

1277
01:06:56,645 --> 01:06:58,704
right here in your mommy's house.

1278
01:06:58,748 --> 01:07:00,648
But first I have to pee.
Where's the bathroom?

1279
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:03,151
You have indoor plumbing
in here, right?

1280
01:07:03,185 --> 01:07:04,777
It's not like you deserve
the extra effort...

1281
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:07,448
but since my reputation's
on the line, I called in a favor.

1282
01:07:07,490 --> 01:07:09,082
You're gonna do a remote interview...

1283
01:07:09,125 --> 01:07:10,683
on <i>The Tyra Banks Show!</i>

1284
01:07:10,726 --> 01:07:13,490
Tomorrow, 9am,
the diva of daytime talk...

1285
01:07:13,529 --> 01:07:15,326
is gonna talk to you live...

1286
01:07:15,364 --> 01:07:18,663
right from this dingy little
shithole you call home.

1287
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:20,931
Fine, good, whatever you need.

1288
01:07:22,705 --> 01:07:24,764
What I need is for you to focus...

1289
01:07:24,807 --> 01:07:27,173
get it together, and point me
to the nearest liquor store.

1290
01:07:27,209 --> 01:07:28,608
OK?

1291
01:07:32,114 --> 01:07:34,173
OK, Tyra Banks, very nice.

1292
01:07:34,216 --> 01:07:38,175
But if you do not know your shit
she will gut you like a fish.

1293
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:40,120
Oh, my Lord.

1294
01:07:42,458 --> 01:07:44,688
You look very beautiful, Mrs. Farley.

1295
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:45,853
Thank you.

1296
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:48,762
She does know what decade it is, right?

1297
01:07:48,798 --> 01:07:50,163
Mom, what are you doing?

1298
01:07:50,199 --> 01:07:52,861
- I'm going to Cornival.
- Ha ha ha.

1299
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:55,097
I'm sorry, you hicks
just crack me up.

1300
01:07:57,706 --> 01:07:59,333
Are you sure? I mean--

1301
01:07:59,375 --> 01:08:01,969
After last night, you know--

1302
01:08:02,011 --> 01:08:05,276
I have certain obligations.
I'm still the Corn Cob Queen.

1303
01:08:05,314 --> 01:08:09,614
- Ha ha ha.
- But you'll be by yourself.

1304
01:08:09,652 --> 01:08:12,212
John, I have been alone
on that float for 20 years.

1305
01:08:12,254 --> 01:08:14,313
I think I can handle it.

1306
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:17,322
Mom, I'm so sorry about last night.

1307
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:20,556
I... just totally lost my head.

1308
01:08:21,964 --> 01:08:24,762
Do you remember Mr. Spanger?

1309
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:26,734
He was the first man
that I tried to date...

1310
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:28,794
after your father died.
I think you were 6.

1311
01:08:28,838 --> 01:08:30,863
And you ran away
from the baby-sitter...

1312
01:08:30,906 --> 01:08:33,670
and we spent the entire night
trying to find you.

1313
01:08:33,709 --> 01:08:36,007
Yeah, I was under the sink.

1314
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:40,808
Well, every time a man asked me
out, you either got sick...

1315
01:08:40,850 --> 01:08:42,681
or you threw a tantrum...

1316
01:08:42,718 --> 01:08:49,385
or you egged the car, or you did
something until I just gave up.

1317
01:08:49,425 --> 01:08:53,691
Did you ever think of how I felt...

1318
01:08:53,729 --> 01:08:56,721
on my own all these years?

1319
01:08:58,033 --> 01:09:00,695
Uh, I guess...

1320
01:09:00,736 --> 01:09:02,795
I thought you... had me.

1321
01:09:06,375 --> 01:09:07,933
Oh.

1322
01:09:15,684 --> 01:09:17,345
All right, Mr. Farley. 20 seconds.

1323
01:09:17,386 --> 01:09:20,651
Hey, game face.
Let's put the hillbilly drama on hold.

1324
01:09:20,689 --> 01:09:23,487
America is waiting.
You look great.

1325
01:09:23,526 --> 01:09:26,017
- This is gonna be fun.
- 15 seconds.

1326
01:09:28,831 --> 01:09:31,493
- I can't do this.
- OK, I understand.

1327
01:09:31,534 --> 01:09:33,126
- That's fine.
- Really?

1328
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:34,602
Of course not!

1329
01:09:34,637 --> 01:09:37,128
Now sit your ass down
and get in front of the camera.

1330
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:39,698
Quiet on set.

1331
01:09:39,742 --> 01:09:44,270
- All right, people, we're on the air in 3, 2--
- Smile.

1332
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:47,676
When I read
my next guest's book...

1333
01:09:47,716 --> 01:09:50,549
I knew I had to have him
on <i>The Tyra Show.</i>

1334
01:09:50,586 --> 01:09:52,918
He's the best-selling author of
<i>Letting Go...</i>

1335
01:09:52,955 --> 01:09:55,219
<i>How To Get Past Your Past.</i>

1336
01:09:55,257 --> 01:09:58,317
Please welcome, via satellite
from Forest Meadow, Nebraska...

1337
01:09:58,360 --> 01:09:59,918
John Farley!

1338
01:09:59,962 --> 01:10:01,190
Hey, John, how you doing?

1339
01:10:01,230 --> 01:10:02,595
I feel great.

1340
01:10:02,631 --> 01:10:04,531
Well, good. You should.

1341
01:10:04,567 --> 01:10:05,727
I mean, your book is inspiring...

1342
01:10:05,768 --> 01:10:07,895
so many people across this country.

1343
01:10:07,937 --> 01:10:10,770
Who's been your biggest inspiration?

1344
01:10:10,806 --> 01:10:12,296
- Uh, my mom.
- Aah.

1345
01:10:12,341 --> 01:10:15,139
See, my mom is
my biggest inspiration too.

1346
01:10:15,177 --> 01:10:17,475
I mean, I would not be where
I am today were it not--

1347
01:10:17,513 --> 01:10:20,209
Johnny, do you ever think of...

1348
01:10:20,249 --> 01:10:24,083
what it was like for me
to be on my own all those years?

1349
01:10:24,119 --> 01:10:26,952
I mean, come on, you guys, give
it up for mommas everywhere!

1350
01:10:26,989 --> 01:10:28,251
Whoo!

1351
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:31,685
I'm--I'm sorry. I gotta go.

1352
01:10:38,334 --> 01:10:40,359
- John?
- You go back in there!

1353
01:10:40,402 --> 01:10:42,893
- No, I won't!
- Go in there and sell that goddamn book!

1354
01:10:42,938 --> 01:10:44,303
No, I won't! My mom needs me!

1355
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:45,739
I don't give a shit!

1356
01:10:45,774 --> 01:10:47,207
You're gonna go in there
and say something...

1357
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:48,972
or I'm gonna shove
my arm up your ass...

1358
01:10:49,011 --> 01:10:50,273
and work you like a puppet!

1359
01:10:50,312 --> 01:10:51,301
Let go of me!

1360
01:10:53,315 --> 01:10:55,180
Fine! Run, you pussy!

1361
01:10:55,217 --> 01:10:57,310
- Go back to your mommy!
- What a bitch!

1362
01:10:57,353 --> 01:11:00,322
See if I care!

1363
01:11:00,356 --> 01:11:01,550
Quiet, please!

1364
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:03,490
I don't know what to do!
I don't know what to do!

1365
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:09,294
Ha ha ha. OK, John, take care.
He's helping people.

1366
01:11:44,033 --> 01:11:46,900
- You back for more?
- Look.

1367
01:11:46,935 --> 01:11:49,199
I screwed up, OK?

1368
01:11:49,238 --> 01:11:50,865
Big time.

1369
01:11:50,906 --> 01:11:54,342
I shouldn't have meddled. L--

1370
01:11:54,376 --> 01:11:56,503
I'm... sorry.

1371
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:01,010
Are you wearing make-up?

1372
01:12:02,084 --> 01:12:04,382
The truth is...

1373
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:07,685
I did it because
I wanted my mom to be happy.

1374
01:12:07,723 --> 01:12:10,419
And as it turns out, the thing
that makes my mom happy...

1375
01:12:10,459 --> 01:12:12,051
unbelievably...

1376
01:12:12,094 --> 01:12:14,289
is you.

1377
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:15,991
It's too late.

1378
01:12:16,031 --> 01:12:18,124
She's made her mind up, Farley.

1379
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:20,727
What? My mom's the best thing
that's ever happened to you.

1380
01:12:20,769 --> 01:12:23,169
One day you'll date girls
and you'll understand.

1381
01:12:23,205 --> 01:12:25,935
Once a woman makes her mind up...

1382
01:12:25,974 --> 01:12:27,566
there's no changing it.

1383
01:12:27,609 --> 01:12:30,043
Oh, I get it. You're scared.

1384
01:12:30,079 --> 01:12:33,014
Your last marriage fell apart
because she was cheating on you.

1385
01:12:33,048 --> 01:12:36,540
Again and again and again.

1386
01:12:36,585 --> 01:12:39,748
The woman's a deviant, Farley.
Who cares?

1387
01:12:39,788 --> 01:12:42,518
So you're scared
of getting hurt again?

1388
01:12:42,558 --> 01:12:44,822
Hey, spare me
the self-help crap, OK?

1389
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:46,987
You're not a guru.
You're a spoiled little kid...

1390
01:12:47,029 --> 01:12:50,192
who can't seem to let go
of his momma's right tit.

1391
01:12:50,232 --> 01:12:51,859
Oh, yeah?

1392
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:54,027
Well, you're just
a pussy with a whistle!

1393
01:12:58,207 --> 01:12:59,799
Really?

1394
01:12:59,842 --> 01:13:01,673
You cocky little shit.

1395
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:03,268
Do you actually think
you're tougher than me?

1396
01:13:04,179 --> 01:13:07,273
Oh. Any time, any place.

1397
01:13:15,257 --> 01:13:17,350
Get the rentals, Farley.

1398
01:13:29,471 --> 01:13:31,371
Seems like old times, doesn't it?

1399
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:34,376
Yeah, well, a new day has come.

1400
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:36,207
Ooh!

1401
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:38,372
That was called a takedown, Farley.

1402
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:42,714
OK. So that's
how it's gonna be, huh?

1403
01:13:49,625 --> 01:13:51,149
Ah!

1404
01:13:51,193 --> 01:13:53,058
Yep, now I'm gonna bring it,
Woodcock.

1405
01:13:53,095 --> 01:13:55,427
You never shut up, do you?

1406
01:13:55,464 --> 01:13:57,523
Why don't you make me?

1407
01:14:02,037 --> 01:14:04,403
Time to earn your wings, Farley.

1408
01:14:05,607 --> 01:14:07,541
It's called a suplex, Farley.

1409
01:14:07,576 --> 01:14:09,168
It's one of my favorites.

1410
01:14:09,211 --> 01:14:11,543
Here's another one of my favorites.

1411
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:14,208
The Vietcong shuffle.

1412
01:14:14,249 --> 01:14:17,047
The reverse Vietcong shuffle!

1413
01:14:17,085 --> 01:14:18,916
Here comes the thunder, Woodcock!

1414
01:14:19,955 --> 01:14:20,944
Ooh!

1415
01:14:24,059 --> 01:14:26,186
Heads up, Farley.

1416
01:14:27,262 --> 01:14:29,492
- Say uncle!
- Pussy!

1417
01:14:29,531 --> 01:14:31,590
- Say it!
- Pussy!

1418
01:14:32,734 --> 01:14:33,758
Ow!

1419
01:14:37,206 --> 01:14:39,766
Russian headlock!

1420
01:14:39,808 --> 01:14:42,743
The gym teacher body slam!

1421
01:14:46,648 --> 01:14:48,081
Are you OK?

1422
01:14:48,116 --> 01:14:50,482
Rhetorical question, Woodcock!

1423
01:14:59,027 --> 01:15:01,723
You remember me now, don't you?

1424
01:15:01,763 --> 01:15:03,458
- Bitch!
- Uh! Uh!

1425
01:15:11,607 --> 01:15:13,302
Mr. Woodcock?

1426
01:15:15,844 --> 01:15:17,311
Oh, shit.

1427
01:15:27,556 --> 01:15:31,048
Got a white male, 50s,
possible concussion.

1428
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:34,185
What are those? Bite marks?

1429
01:15:34,229 --> 01:15:35,560
Uh...

1430
01:15:37,299 --> 01:15:39,631
Come on, Scooter.
Get that mask off of me.

1431
01:15:39,668 --> 01:15:42,159
Oh, thank God.
I thought I'd killed you.

1432
01:15:42,204 --> 01:15:45,367
You couldn't kill me with a shotgun
and a head start, Farley.

1433
01:15:45,407 --> 01:15:48,240
Said by the man flat on his back
in an ambulance.

1434
01:15:48,277 --> 01:15:53,340
Yeah, well, it's about time
you showed some backbone.

1435
01:15:53,382 --> 01:15:55,009
Is that a compliment?

1436
01:15:55,050 --> 01:15:56,210
Farley, I'm just saying...

1437
01:15:56,251 --> 01:15:59,220
that you showed some sack
out there today, OK?

1438
01:15:59,254 --> 01:16:00,744
Wow.

1439
01:16:00,789 --> 01:16:03,917
Maybe there is a human being
hiding in there somewhere.

1440
01:16:03,959 --> 01:16:06,860
I mean, seriously,
why can't you be nice to people?

1441
01:16:06,895 --> 01:16:10,524
Lt--it's not healthy being
such a dick all the time.

1442
01:16:10,566 --> 01:16:12,329
You're gonna end up like your dad...

1443
01:16:12,367 --> 01:16:15,234
just angry and bitter and alone.

1444
01:16:15,270 --> 01:16:18,034
If that's what you want, then
fine, but I don't think it is.

1445
01:16:18,073 --> 01:16:21,531
Now, right now, my mom is
on that float all by herself...

1446
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:24,045
really wishing that you
were up there with her.

1447
01:16:24,079 --> 01:16:26,570
The problem is...

1448
01:16:26,615 --> 01:16:30,176
I don't think you got
the backbone to win her back.

1449
01:16:30,218 --> 01:16:32,083
Oh, really?

1450
01:16:35,958 --> 01:16:37,653
Watch out!

1451
01:16:39,328 --> 01:16:41,387
Come on, Farley!
Step up the pace!

1452
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:43,295
I could if you weren't
such a fat ass!

1453
01:16:43,332 --> 01:16:45,425
Watch out! Excuse me!

1454
01:16:45,467 --> 01:16:46,991
- Keppen! You're off tempo!
- Aah!

1455
01:16:47,035 --> 01:16:49,230
- Watch out!
- You're flat, Mount-Gardner.

1456
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:51,296
- Excuse us! Hey!
- Oh!

1457
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:53,501
Excuse us!

1458
01:16:53,542 --> 01:16:54,634
Come on, Farley!

1459
01:16:54,676 --> 01:16:57,839
- Mom! Mom!
- Beverly! Beverly!

1460
01:16:57,879 --> 01:17:00,370
Oh, my God, what happened?

1461
01:17:00,415 --> 01:17:02,610
Jasper, why are you
on that gurney?

1462
01:17:02,651 --> 01:17:06,280
I don't know, honey,
but I'm here to say that...

1463
01:17:06,321 --> 01:17:08,016
I'm basically sorry.

1464
01:17:08,056 --> 01:17:09,819
Basically sorry?

1465
01:17:09,858 --> 01:17:12,418
Mom, for an emotional cripple
like Woodcock...

1466
01:17:12,461 --> 01:17:14,122
that's a huge step.

1467
01:17:14,162 --> 01:17:16,960
Listen, I'm the one
who should be apologizing, OK?

1468
01:17:16,999 --> 01:17:18,489
This is all my fault.

1469
01:17:18,533 --> 01:17:20,433
Just give it another shot.

1470
01:17:20,469 --> 01:17:22,369
'Cause my lungs
are about to explode.

1471
01:17:22,404 --> 01:17:24,634
Please, honey.

1472
01:17:29,911 --> 01:17:31,674
- Oh!
- Oh, my God!

1473
01:17:32,881 --> 01:17:34,906
Stop! Stop!

1474
01:17:36,284 --> 01:17:38,980
Mr. Woodcock!

1475
01:17:39,021 --> 01:17:40,716
You OK?

1476
01:17:40,756 --> 01:17:42,747
Nice work, Farley.

1477
01:17:42,791 --> 01:17:46,386
There's one pothole in this town
and you managed to find it.

1478
01:17:46,428 --> 01:17:48,658
Jasper! Oh, my God.

1479
01:17:48,697 --> 01:17:50,494
Oh, my God, Jasper.

1480
01:17:50,532 --> 01:17:52,591
Jasper.

1481
01:17:52,634 --> 01:17:54,625
Are you OK?

1482
01:17:58,807 --> 01:18:01,742
I'm sorry, Mom.

1483
01:18:01,777 --> 01:18:03,904
I thought I was doing
the right thing.

1484
01:18:03,945 --> 01:18:05,674
By killing him?

1485
01:18:05,714 --> 01:18:08,342
I called 911, didn't I?

1486
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:11,216
Ha ha ha. Yes.

1487
01:18:11,253 --> 01:18:14,051
For what it's worth,
I want you to be with Jasper.

1488
01:18:14,089 --> 01:18:17,217
- I don't believe you.
- I do. L--

1489
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:21,189
If it means anything at all...

1490
01:18:21,229 --> 01:18:22,924
you have my blessing.

1491
01:18:29,671 --> 01:18:31,730
You can see Mr. Woodcock now.

1492
01:18:36,945 --> 01:18:38,173
Listen, uh...

1493
01:18:40,315 --> 01:18:43,546
I just want to say I'm--I'm sorry...

1494
01:18:43,585 --> 01:18:46,782
About the "nailing your mother"
comment there.

1495
01:18:52,327 --> 01:18:53,658
That's it?

1496
01:18:54,696 --> 01:18:55,685
What do you mean?

1497
01:18:55,731 --> 01:18:57,528
I thought you would apologize for--

1498
01:18:57,566 --> 01:18:59,397
Mom, Mom.

1499
01:18:59,434 --> 01:19:03,632
I know this is gonna be hard for
you to believe, coming from me.

1500
01:19:03,672 --> 01:19:06,607
But Jasper is a good person.

1501
01:19:06,641 --> 01:19:09,132
You see, somewhere around the
time Jasper was choking me--

1502
01:19:09,177 --> 01:19:11,771
- Yeah, with your own foot.
- Right.

1503
01:19:11,813 --> 01:19:14,714
I had a revelation.

1504
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:16,809
You don't get past your past.

1505
01:19:16,852 --> 01:19:19,116
You embrace it.

1506
01:19:19,154 --> 01:19:21,088
And I'm not that fat little loser anymore...

1507
01:19:21,123 --> 01:19:22,647
and that's because he pushed me.

1508
01:19:22,691 --> 01:19:26,923
And, in a really weird way...

1509
01:19:26,962 --> 01:19:29,089
he's a big part of who I am today.

1510
01:19:32,033 --> 01:19:35,434
For Christ's sakes, it was just
a P.E. Class, you fruitcake.

1511
01:19:35,470 --> 01:19:37,665
- Jasper!
- Well, it was.

1512
01:19:40,675 --> 01:19:41,835
See?

1513
01:19:43,078 --> 01:19:44,875
Set of ten, Farley.

1514
01:19:44,913 --> 01:19:46,938
- What?
- Just joking.

1515
01:19:51,186 --> 01:19:54,986
# I see a bad moon rising #

1516
01:19:56,358 --> 01:19:59,816
# I see trouble on the way #

1517
01:20:01,897 --> 01:20:05,492
# I see earthquakes and lightning #

1518
01:20:07,235 --> 01:20:09,931
Merry Christmas, Woodcock.

1519
01:20:09,971 --> 01:20:11,962
Merry Christmas, Farley.

1520
01:20:14,576 --> 01:20:16,407
I read your book.

1521
01:20:16,444 --> 01:20:18,810
Really? What did you think?

1522
01:20:18,847 --> 01:20:21,475
Well, that part about, uh,
treating others...

1523
01:20:21,516 --> 01:20:23,484
how you want to be treated,
I guess that's all right.

1524
01:20:23,518 --> 01:20:26,851
Yeah, I sort of stole that
from the Bible, but...

1525
01:20:26,888 --> 01:20:28,788
I'll take credit for it.

1526
01:20:28,824 --> 01:20:31,622
The rest of it's pretty much crap.

1527
01:20:32,828 --> 01:20:34,625
What the hell, man?
That's my book!

1528
01:20:34,663 --> 01:20:36,221
It's my book, Farley.

1529
01:20:36,264 --> 01:20:38,960
You gave it to me.
I can do with it as I please.

1530
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:42,436
# I hear the voice
of rage and ruin #

1531
01:20:44,573 --> 01:20:46,837
# Don't go around tonight #

1532
01:20:46,875 --> 01:20:49,969
# Well, it's bound to
take your life #

1533
01:20:50,011 --> 01:20:53,071
Oh, hey. Look, your new book.

1534
01:20:53,114 --> 01:20:55,014
- Congrats, John.
- Let me see.

1535
01:20:55,050 --> 01:20:57,678
- Congratulations.
- Oh, my gosh. Look at that.

1536
01:20:58,620 --> 01:21:00,485
Oh, wow.

1537
01:21:00,522 --> 01:21:01,819
Yeah, it's
really, really good, John.

1538
01:21:01,857 --> 01:21:03,791
Wow, you read it?

1539
01:21:03,825 --> 01:21:05,759
Don't make me lie on Christmas.

1540
01:21:05,794 --> 01:21:07,523
Well, as long as we're
congratulating people...

1541
01:21:07,562 --> 01:21:09,325
Beverly and I have
a little announcement.

1542
01:21:09,364 --> 01:21:12,060
Recently, uh, one of my swimmers
took hold...

1543
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:13,089
Mm!

1544
01:21:13,134 --> 01:21:15,568
And, uh, your mother's got
a little Woodcock in her.

1545
01:21:17,672 --> 01:21:18,696
What?

1546
01:21:18,740 --> 01:21:20,867
You're gonna be
a big brother, Farley.

1547
01:21:22,277 --> 01:21:23,904
Just joking.

1548
01:21:35,056 --> 01:21:36,751
# It could be ten
but then again #

1549
01:21:36,791 --> 01:21:41,785
# I can't remember half an hour
since a quarter to four #

1550
01:21:41,830 --> 01:21:44,264
# Throw on your clothes,
the second side of <i>Surfer Rosa</i> #

1551
01:21:44,299 --> 01:21:47,496
# And you leave me
with my jaw on the floor #

1552
01:21:47,535 --> 01:21:48,866
# Hey! #

1553
01:21:51,006 --> 01:21:54,373
# Oh, just when you think
you're in control #

1554
01:21:54,409 --> 01:21:56,536
# Just when you think
you've got a hold #

1555
01:21:56,578 --> 01:21:58,307
# Just when you got on a roll #

1556
01:21:58,346 --> 01:22:01,577
# Oh, here it goes, here it
goes, here it goes again #

1557
01:22:01,616 --> 01:22:03,447
# Oh, here it goes again #

1558
01:22:03,485 --> 01:22:06,420
# I shoulda known, shoulda
known, shoulda known again #

1559
01:22:06,454 --> 01:22:09,287
# Oh, here it goes again #

1560
01:22:09,324 --> 01:22:11,485
# Oh, oh, here it goes again #

1561
01:22:14,696 --> 01:22:17,392
# It starts out easy, something
simple, something sleazy #

1562
01:22:17,432 --> 01:22:20,993
# Something inching
past the edge of reserve #

1563
01:22:21,036 --> 01:22:24,130
# Now through the lines
of cheap Venetian blinds #

1564
01:22:24,172 --> 01:22:26,800
# Your car is pulling
off of the curb #

1565
01:22:26,841 --> 01:22:28,331
# Hey! #

1566
01:22:30,445 --> 01:22:33,642
# Oh, just when you think
you're in control #

1567
01:22:33,682 --> 01:22:35,912
# Just when you think
you've got a hold #

1568
01:22:35,951 --> 01:22:37,851
# Just when you've got on a roll #

1569
01:22:37,886 --> 01:22:40,878
# Here it goes, here it goes,
here it goes again #

1570
01:22:40,922 --> 01:22:42,651
# Oh, here it goes again #

1571
01:22:42,691 --> 01:22:45,990
# I shoulda known, shoulda known,
shoulda known again #

1572
01:22:46,027 --> 01:22:47,824
# But here it goes again #

1573
01:22:47,862 --> 01:22:50,888
# Oh, here it goes,
oh, here it goes #

1574
01:22:50,932 --> 01:22:53,059
# Oh, here it goes again #

1575
01:22:53,101 --> 01:22:55,934
# Oh! Oh, here it goes again #
