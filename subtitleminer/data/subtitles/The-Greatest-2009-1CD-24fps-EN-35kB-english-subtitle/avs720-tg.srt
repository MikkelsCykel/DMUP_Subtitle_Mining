1
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:47,323
# Among the trees
and by the river #

2
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:50,853
# Lying there, my darling shivers #

3
00:00:50,956 --> 00:00:54,979
# In her sleep
she dreams of winter #

4
00:00:55,157 --> 00:00:56,918
# Whiter than her breast #

5
00:00:58,423 --> 00:01:02,287
# I feel her heart
move through her chest #

6
00:01:02,389 --> 00:01:05,822
# Warm and steady
as she rests #

7
00:01:05,923 --> 00:01:09,912
# Hear water ebbing
with her breath #

8
00:01:10,023 --> 00:01:12,887
# Lulling me to sleep #

9
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,717
# Ohh-ohh-ohh #

10
00:01:16,723 --> 00:01:20,053
# Ohh-ohh-ohh #

11
00:01:21,523 --> 00:01:23,853
# And here in the sky #

12
00:01:24,023 --> 00:01:28,512
# Lights flash before our eyes #

13
00:01:28,623 --> 00:01:32,680
# And I feel your warm hand #

14
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:35,948
# Slipping into mine #

15
00:01:36,055 --> 00:01:38,044
# And we lay... #

16
00:01:38,156 --> 00:01:40,384
You okay?

17
00:01:40,489 --> 00:01:44,251
# Will I come around? #

18
00:01:44,356 --> 00:01:53,846
# Do I know
what you are feeling now? #

19
00:01:59,055 --> 00:02:03,646
# This morning
we drove out of town #

20
00:02:03,822 --> 00:02:06,913
# Into the hills
and looking down #

21
00:02:07,022 --> 00:02:10,454
# Saw the ocean all around #

22
00:02:10,555 --> 00:02:12,612
# As far as we could see #

23
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:17,185
All right, I have a secret
to tell you.

24
00:02:17,288 --> 00:02:18,982
You're in the middle of the road.

25
00:02:19,122 --> 00:02:22,144
I know.
Do you wanna hear it?

26
00:02:22,321 --> 00:02:23,844
Do you wanna
move your car first?

27
00:02:24,022 --> 00:02:25,715
No, not really.

28
00:02:25,855 --> 00:02:27,218
Okay.

29
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:30,082
I just wanna tell you
one more thing.

30
00:02:30,255 --> 00:02:31,949
All right.

31
00:02:32,088 --> 00:02:33,019
What?

32
00:02:36,155 --> 00:02:38,087
That's not gonna be good.

33
00:02:38,755 --> 00:02:40,721
Okay, tell me.

34
00:02:45,021 --> 00:02:46,282
I've been in love with you...

35
00:03:28,654 --> 00:03:31,814
Hey, hey, hey.

36
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:35,243
Shh.

37
00:03:55,953 --> 00:03:57,816
John Muir said,

38
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:01,749
"Let children walk with nature.

39
00:04:01,853 --> 00:04:04,547
Let them see the beautiful
blendings and communions

40
00:04:04,653 --> 00:04:06,415
of death and life,

41
00:04:06,553 --> 00:04:09,917
their joyous, inseparable unity,

42
00:04:10,087 --> 00:04:14,349
and they will learn that death
is stingless indeed

43
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,452
and as beautiful as life. "

44
00:04:17,254 --> 00:04:19,344
That is my hope for Bennett,

45
00:04:19,553 --> 00:04:22,542
that this amazing young man,

46
00:04:22,653 --> 00:04:25,017
who was taken from us so suddenly,

47
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,447
who was so well-loved,

48
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:31,109
who was surrounded by everything
that was beautiful to him.

49
00:04:32,087 --> 00:04:35,246
It is in this spirit
that we return Bennett

50
00:04:35,386 --> 00:04:41,148
to that form from which God
miraculously created all life.

51
00:07:52,216 --> 00:07:53,682
Come on.
Open the door, Ryan.

52
00:07:53,817 --> 00:07:55,646
Hold on.

53
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:58,912
Come on.

54
00:07:59,016 --> 00:08:00,175
Just let me... Ryan.

55
00:08:00,283 --> 00:08:01,715
Just let me... Hey.

56
00:08:01,817 --> 00:08:03,975
Come on, buddy.
Let me in.

57
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:06,446
Jesus Christ, Ryan.

58
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:09,810
Open up some of these windows,
would ya?

59
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:11,007
I don't care what you say.

60
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:13,139
Next time you're gonna
let Gloria up here.

61
00:08:13,283 --> 00:08:14,249
Sorry.

62
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:17,373
Smells like something died
and went to heaven.

63
00:08:17,483 --> 00:08:19,108
I didn't know she was here.

64
00:08:19,216 --> 00:08:20,477
Well, she's not.

65
00:08:20,582 --> 00:08:24,708
But she's coming back very soon.

66
00:08:24,816 --> 00:08:26,043
Where have you been?

67
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:28,082
I've been here.

68
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:29,613
What, in the house?

69
00:08:29,782 --> 00:08:31,305
Yeah.

70
00:08:31,415 --> 00:08:33,608
Well, then just check in
from time to time, would you?

71
00:08:33,782 --> 00:08:35,407
Your mother's worried.

72
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:36,446
Okay.

73
00:08:37,616 --> 00:08:40,242
What I wanna know...
What I need to know is, um,

74
00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:45,680
what were the 17 minutes like
for my son?

75
00:08:45,849 --> 00:08:48,679
I don't know what to tell you,
Mrs. Brewer. I wasn't there.

76
00:08:48,782 --> 00:08:52,179
You've spoken with every doctor,
every nurse, every paramedic,

77
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:54,145
every fireman
that was on call that night.

78
00:08:54,249 --> 00:08:56,442
I don't know what other information
I can give you.

79
00:08:56,549 --> 00:08:57,913
What about Jordan Walker?

80
00:08:58,048 --> 00:08:59,514
Mr. Walker is still in a coma.

81
00:08:59,616 --> 00:09:02,138
I know, but I have
a surveillance tape,

82
00:09:02,249 --> 00:09:04,841
and in that tape
it looks as if they spoke,

83
00:09:04,948 --> 00:09:06,471
that they might have had
a conversation.

84
00:09:06,582 --> 00:09:09,639
Would he have been capable of having
a conversation with my son?

85
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:12,543
That depends on how slow
the bleeding in his brain was.

86
00:09:12,682 --> 00:09:15,738
Uh, I mean, it's possible

87
00:09:15,848 --> 00:09:18,246
that he could have stayed
conscious long enough

88
00:09:18,382 --> 00:09:20,348
to carry on a conversation.

89
00:09:20,482 --> 00:09:22,811
Then he would have been
the last person

90
00:09:22,915 --> 00:09:24,472
to speak to my son
before he died.

91
00:09:24,581 --> 00:09:26,013
Yes.

92
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:29,047
Uh, I have an appointment at 9:00.
I'm sorry.

93
00:09:29,149 --> 00:09:30,774
When do you think he'll wake up?

94
00:09:30,882 --> 00:09:34,007
Uh, as I've said numerous times
before, Mrs. Brewer,

95
00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:36,740
I have given you
all the answers that I know.

96
00:09:36,848 --> 00:09:39,314
But he could wake up.
I mean, what would be the signs?

97
00:09:39,414 --> 00:09:40,846
I'm sorry.

98
00:09:40,948 --> 00:09:43,005
Dr. Leonard, 2291.

99
00:09:45,581 --> 00:09:47,342
Allen?

100
00:09:50,248 --> 00:09:51,714
Allen?

101
00:09:53,781 --> 00:09:55,713
Hi. Hi.
How are you?

102
00:09:55,815 --> 00:10:00,406
I'm sorry. I had a head
full of numbers.

103
00:10:00,548 --> 00:10:04,275
Oh, you're sweating. Here.

104
00:10:04,381 --> 00:10:06,370
Uh...

105
00:10:06,515 --> 00:10:08,572
Yeah.

106
00:10:08,715 --> 00:10:10,578
Yeah, thank you.
You're right.

107
00:10:11,348 --> 00:10:14,337
I'll turn up the A.C.

108
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:17,938
Is this, uh...
Is this roster correct?

109
00:10:18,047 --> 00:10:20,411
'Cause I don't have Linda
down here for the summer.

110
00:10:20,515 --> 00:10:21,606
How are you?

111
00:10:21,714 --> 00:10:23,112
All right.

112
00:10:23,214 --> 00:10:25,476
You look like
you've forgotten to sleep.

113
00:10:26,448 --> 00:10:28,073
I'm all right. I'm fine.

114
00:10:28,181 --> 00:10:30,204
Thanks for the flowers.
They're not necessary.

115
00:10:30,348 --> 00:10:31,711
I wanted to call so many times.

116
00:10:31,814 --> 00:10:34,712
I didn't know what to do
in this situation.

117
00:10:34,847 --> 00:10:37,813
I just want to be strong
for Grace, that's all.

118
00:10:37,947 --> 00:10:40,708
- That's all I'm doing.
- Of course.

119
00:10:42,881 --> 00:10:46,109
So, we got, um...

120
00:10:46,214 --> 00:10:48,702
We got 30 students here.

121
00:10:48,847 --> 00:10:50,813
Ready and praying to graduate.

122
00:10:50,914 --> 00:10:54,209
Well, let's see what I can do, huh?

123
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:57,640
If you want anything,
anything at all,

124
00:10:57,747 --> 00:10:59,576
just let me know.

125
00:10:59,714 --> 00:11:01,976
I will.

126
00:11:27,147 --> 00:11:31,875
Ah! I read about
an interesting idea today.

127
00:11:32,713 --> 00:11:35,736
I even made a purchase.

128
00:11:37,713 --> 00:11:42,645
There seems to be a lot of research
on the Web about grief,

129
00:11:42,746 --> 00:11:47,804
and, uh, I stumbled across
a couple of interesting suggestions.

130
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,570
Oh, Allen, no, don't.

131
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:52,509
They suggested we use a bell.

132
00:12:03,412 --> 00:12:09,436
We can ring this
when we're missing Bennett

133
00:12:09,546 --> 00:12:13,273
or when we think about him.

134
00:12:16,412 --> 00:12:18,503
You can put it anywhere
in the house you like.

135
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:21,238
Can I see the bell?

136
00:13:28,878 --> 00:13:30,538
Hello.

137
00:13:30,645 --> 00:13:32,304
Hello.

138
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,470
- Rose, right?
- Yeah.

139
00:13:35,578 --> 00:13:38,203
Come on in.

140
00:13:38,311 --> 00:13:40,607
Just through here.

141
00:13:46,777 --> 00:13:49,300
Would you like some tea,
soda, water?

142
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:52,172
No, I'm fine. Thank you.
I'm sorry for just stopping by.

143
00:13:52,278 --> 00:13:53,743
No, no, not at all.
I'm glad you did.

144
00:13:53,878 --> 00:13:56,742
I've wanted to talk to you
since the service.

145
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:58,434
Uh, yeah, I know.

146
00:13:58,544 --> 00:14:00,669
I wish I could've given
your wife more answers.

147
00:14:00,777 --> 00:14:03,005
I know how much she wanted them.

148
00:14:03,145 --> 00:14:06,134
She certainly does want her answers.
She's very focused on the matter.

149
00:14:06,277 --> 00:14:08,800
But, well, it's only a matter of time.

150
00:14:08,944 --> 00:14:10,807
How are you feeling?

151
00:14:10,944 --> 00:14:13,603
Oh...

152
00:14:13,744 --> 00:14:15,642
Water.
Could I have some water?

153
00:14:15,744 --> 00:14:16,801
Yes, of course.

154
00:14:16,944 --> 00:14:19,808
Please, just sit down,
make yourself comfortable.

155
00:14:19,944 --> 00:14:22,239
I've been trying to figure out
how you knew Bennett.

156
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:24,308
Are you part
of Youth in Government?

157
00:14:24,444 --> 00:14:27,308
Uh, no.

158
00:14:27,444 --> 00:14:32,502
Ah, you must be an intern, then,
at the paper.

159
00:14:32,611 --> 00:14:33,871
No.

160
00:14:33,977 --> 00:14:36,466
No? Um, community service?

161
00:14:36,577 --> 00:14:39,065
Just tell me if I'm hot or cold.

162
00:14:39,244 --> 00:14:40,437
Cold.

163
00:14:40,544 --> 00:14:42,442
Well, not East Ivy.

164
00:14:42,611 --> 00:14:46,099
I don't think he held on to many
of his friends from his junior high.

165
00:14:46,277 --> 00:14:51,005
No, I'm the one he got pregnant.

166
00:14:52,543 --> 00:14:53,770
Excuse me?

167
00:14:53,943 --> 00:14:56,307
I'm pregnant.

168
00:14:58,443 --> 00:15:02,808
I'm sorry. I'm...
I don't understand.

169
00:15:02,977 --> 00:15:06,431
I'm three months pregnant.

170
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:15,037
Is it Bennett's?

171
00:15:18,877 --> 00:15:20,137
Yes.

172
00:15:23,977 --> 00:15:25,909
Are you sure?

173
00:15:28,076 --> 00:15:29,303
Yeah.

174
00:15:33,143 --> 00:15:34,473
Are you going to keep it?

175
00:15:40,009 --> 00:15:43,702
She told me
they only spent one night together.

176
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:46,240
I just can't believe
she has nowhere else to go.

177
00:15:46,343 --> 00:15:47,706
There must be somewhere
she can stay

178
00:15:47,809 --> 00:15:48,900
until the paternity test.

179
00:15:49,076 --> 00:15:52,133
Paternity test? I'm not putting
that poor girl through that.

180
00:15:52,309 --> 00:15:54,934
- Why are you defending her?
- I'm not defending her.

181
00:15:55,109 --> 00:15:57,098
I just don't see why she would
make something like this up.

182
00:15:57,209 --> 00:15:59,674
- Because she's 18 and broke.
- Well.

183
00:15:59,842 --> 00:16:02,172
I can't deal with this.
I just can't deal with this.

184
00:16:02,276 --> 00:16:05,106
Grace, Grace, Grace.
Come here. Come here.

185
00:16:05,209 --> 00:16:08,004
- We don't even know this girl.
- I know.

186
00:16:08,143 --> 00:16:10,665
But she seems like a nice girl.

187
00:16:10,809 --> 00:16:13,331
If it turns out to be his,
I'm not gonna be happy about it.

188
00:16:13,442 --> 00:16:16,670
I mean, I don't want everybody
thinking that we're blessed.

189
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,468
You don't think we're blessed,
do you?

190
00:16:18,575 --> 00:16:20,302
No, I don't.

191
00:16:20,408 --> 00:16:22,772
She's probably the one
that dyed his hair blue, too.

192
00:16:22,876 --> 00:16:24,171
He never would have done that.

193
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:26,639
Finish making the bed.
I'm gonna go down and gather...

194
00:16:26,742 --> 00:16:29,731
Wait, wait, wait. Why does
she have to come to our house?

195
00:16:29,876 --> 00:16:31,034
We're grieving.

196
00:16:31,142 --> 00:16:33,165
That's not gonna be good
for the baby.

197
00:16:33,308 --> 00:16:36,899
This must be her only choice.

198
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:56,766
Are you really pregnant?

199
00:16:58,275 --> 00:16:59,740
Yeah.

200
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:01,738
That figures.

201
00:17:01,841 --> 00:17:03,330
The one bad thing my brother does,

202
00:17:03,442 --> 00:17:06,965
and he's not even here
to get in trouble for it.

203
00:17:07,641 --> 00:17:08,107
I'm Rose.

204
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:09,867
I know, yeah.
I know who you are.

205
00:17:09,975 --> 00:17:13,237
My brother kept your yearbook photo
on his bedside table.

206
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,464
- He did?
- Yeah, and I wouldn't touch it,

207
00:17:15,641 --> 00:17:17,834
because he probably
jerked off to it every night.

208
00:17:19,508 --> 00:17:21,269
So you're his little brother.

209
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:23,407
Yeah, the fuck-up.

210
00:17:23,574 --> 00:17:25,699
He didn't tell you that?
He didn't tell you I was a fuck-up?

211
00:17:25,808 --> 00:17:28,831
No, he never said
you were fucked up.

212
00:17:29,008 --> 00:17:32,303
He was just being polite then.

213
00:17:32,474 --> 00:17:35,099
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Why?

214
00:17:35,241 --> 00:17:37,230
Do I not look like I'm okay?

215
00:17:37,374 --> 00:17:38,635
No, you seem a little jumpy.

216
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:42,604
I'm a little restless. Yeah.

217
00:17:50,307 --> 00:17:51,637
You have a fever.

218
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:54,865
I don't know why.
I feel fine.

219
00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:57,099
- Ryan?
- Yeah?

220
00:17:57,207 --> 00:17:59,832
My mom just checked into rehab.

221
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:03,633
Bananas and Gatorade should help.

222
00:18:03,773 --> 00:18:05,898
Yeah.

223
00:19:20,073 --> 00:19:21,333
What would you say

224
00:19:21,439 --> 00:19:23,065
if someone asked you
about this night?

225
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:30,401
Why do you want a compliment
from me so badly?

226
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:34,198
Because you haven't
given me anything.

227
00:19:34,305 --> 00:19:37,499
I've given you everything.

228
00:19:37,606 --> 00:19:40,367
Right, but I want more.

229
00:19:40,506 --> 00:19:44,836
I want to know
what you're thinking.

230
00:19:44,939 --> 00:19:47,131
Please?

231
00:19:48,405 --> 00:19:51,565
I would say...

232
00:19:56,072 --> 00:19:58,504
I would say...

233
00:20:10,005 --> 00:20:12,096
The greatest?

234
00:20:13,738 --> 00:20:15,670
I like that.

235
00:20:18,072 --> 00:20:20,368
I like those words.

236
00:20:49,138 --> 00:20:53,230
I want my baby.
He's just... He's...

237
00:20:53,404 --> 00:20:55,529
One appliance,
less than 1,500.

238
00:20:55,638 --> 00:20:58,160
Somebody help me
find my baby!

239
00:20:58,338 --> 00:21:00,395
Somebody help me find my baby!

240
00:21:00,505 --> 00:21:02,528
See, I don't know where he went.

241
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:05,263
Have you seen my baby?

242
00:21:05,371 --> 00:21:07,394
I can't find him.
I can't find him.

243
00:21:07,505 --> 00:21:09,732
- Calm, calm. Shh, shh.
- He's so small.

244
00:21:09,837 --> 00:21:12,303
He was right here,
and now I can't find him!

245
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:14,131
Come on, sweetheart.

246
00:21:35,804 --> 00:21:38,599
My mom takes walks
every night at 6:00.

247
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:40,497
I followed her two nights ago.

248
00:21:40,604 --> 00:21:42,866
She just circles the block
over and over again

249
00:21:42,971 --> 00:21:44,129
looking for James.

250
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,429
Hold that thought.

251
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:47,935
Hi. You must be Ryan.

252
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,127
Uh-huh.

253
00:21:49,303 --> 00:21:50,667
Come in, please.
Sit down.

254
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:56,161
We were just finishing up
with Latent.

255
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:59,327
Feel free to listen or join in,
whatever you're comfortable with.

256
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:00,493
Okay.

257
00:22:00,604 --> 00:22:02,160
Sorry, Latent.

258
00:22:03,504 --> 00:22:05,833
When I asked my dad
where she was the first night,

259
00:22:06,003 --> 00:22:07,731
he said she was looking for James.

260
00:22:07,836 --> 00:22:10,029
Sometimes she'll just run
to his bedroom

261
00:22:10,137 --> 00:22:11,228
and throw open the door,

262
00:22:11,337 --> 00:22:14,132
like she expects to see him sitting
at his computer or something.

263
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:17,536
Often parents
that didn't view the body,

264
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:19,125
like your mother,

265
00:22:19,303 --> 00:22:21,632
still look for their child in crowds.

266
00:22:21,736 --> 00:22:23,497
Sometimes they even think
they see them.

267
00:22:23,669 --> 00:22:26,067
It's normal, Latent.

268
00:22:26,203 --> 00:22:27,862
The best thing you can do
for your mother

269
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:29,833
is talk about it with her.

270
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:32,435
I think it could help.

271
00:22:34,402 --> 00:22:36,800
So, Ryan, hi.

272
00:22:36,903 --> 00:22:38,391
Hi.

273
00:22:38,569 --> 00:22:40,001
What brings you here?

274
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:42,068
Nothin'.

275
00:22:42,203 --> 00:22:44,862
I just thought it was
the normal thing to do.

276
00:22:45,003 --> 00:22:47,662
Are you experiencing
any symptoms of grief?

277
00:22:48,269 --> 00:22:50,394
No.

278
00:22:52,469 --> 00:22:56,265
Who are you here to see?
Jordan Walker.

279
00:22:57,436 --> 00:22:59,629
I don't know why
they can't get this right.

280
00:22:59,803 --> 00:23:01,701
He prefers the blinds open
during the day.

281
00:23:01,803 --> 00:23:03,666
Does he really?
Did he tell you that

282
00:23:03,769 --> 00:23:05,859
after he requested
the aquarium over there?

283
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:09,367
I just wanted a little life
in this room.

284
00:23:09,503 --> 00:23:15,663
Uh, decaf caramel macchiato,
extra foam.

285
00:23:15,802 --> 00:23:16,632
Sheila told me.

286
00:23:16,735 --> 00:23:17,928
If you're trying to bribe me

287
00:23:18,035 --> 00:23:19,592
into feeding that fish
on the weekend,

288
00:23:19,702 --> 00:23:20,600
it's not gonna work.

289
00:23:20,702 --> 00:23:23,964
No, it's fine.
I'll be here on the weekends.

290
00:23:28,302 --> 00:23:29,427
Thank you.

291
00:23:29,535 --> 00:23:31,229
You're welcome.

292
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:33,800
Oh, and, Toni, could you
ask Dr. Jacobson

293
00:23:33,902 --> 00:23:35,629
to stop in when he gets here?

294
00:23:35,735 --> 00:23:37,598
I have a few questions for him.

295
00:23:38,468 --> 00:23:41,060
- Right away.
- Thank you.

296
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:44,033
- You give him the balloons, okay?
- Yeah.

297
00:23:44,136 --> 00:23:46,897
Mrs. Rodriguez?
- Yes?

298
00:23:58,802 --> 00:24:01,734
She's cool. It's my dad.
He thinks it's stupid.

299
00:24:09,468 --> 00:24:12,400
You know, you don't have to share
if you don't want to.

300
00:24:12,535 --> 00:24:14,364
You can just listen.

301
00:24:14,502 --> 00:24:16,525
I highly recommend
not sharing, actually.

302
00:24:16,635 --> 00:24:20,158
These people
are like grief vultures.

303
00:24:20,268 --> 00:24:22,427
And why are you here?

304
00:24:22,535 --> 00:24:24,091
Nowhere else to go.

305
00:24:24,201 --> 00:24:25,757
And my sister Amy
blew her brains out

306
00:24:25,868 --> 00:24:26,959
while we were at church.

307
00:24:28,001 --> 00:24:29,967
Oh. I'm sorry.

308
00:24:30,101 --> 00:24:31,124
What about you?

309
00:24:31,301 --> 00:24:33,596
Oh, my brother, um...

310
00:24:33,701 --> 00:24:36,065
He died in a car accident.

311
00:24:36,168 --> 00:24:38,759
There are a ton
of car accidents here.

312
00:24:38,901 --> 00:24:42,026
Latent's brother was in a car.
So was Sarah's and Jason's.

313
00:24:42,135 --> 00:24:44,101
Uh, Hilary's sister O.D.'d,

314
00:24:44,268 --> 00:24:47,234
and Jeremy's brother died
before he was even born,

315
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,128
and he's, like, the most
dramatic one here.

316
00:24:49,234 --> 00:24:51,564
It's like, do you even
remember him?

317
00:24:51,701 --> 00:24:53,860
So, you're the only suicide?

318
00:24:53,968 --> 00:24:55,593
How do you know it wasn't murder?

319
00:24:57,001 --> 00:25:00,660
Because you just said
she blew her brains out.

320
00:25:00,801 --> 00:25:02,028
Oh.

321
00:25:02,134 --> 00:25:04,066
Yeah. Only a suicide.

322
00:25:04,167 --> 00:25:06,429
Really special.

323
00:25:06,534 --> 00:25:09,898
You know, it does get easier,
or more interesting,

324
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,160
all the different layers
of fucked-up-ness.

325
00:25:14,601 --> 00:25:18,556
I'm fine.
I'm doing okay, actually. Yeah.

326
00:25:18,734 --> 00:25:19,700
Well, even if you're not,

327
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,460
the groups are really good ways
to talk about it.

328
00:25:21,601 --> 00:25:24,123
Your friends are gonna start
avoiding you like the plague.

329
00:25:24,234 --> 00:25:26,291
I'm not even really
talking about it with them.

330
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,263
Well, then I'm really glad
you're here.

331
00:26:19,066 --> 00:26:21,294
Did you ever notice me at all

332
00:26:21,466 --> 00:26:23,091
any of those times
we passed each other?

333
00:26:23,199 --> 00:26:27,529
Did you at least recognize me
at some point?

334
00:26:27,633 --> 00:26:30,155
Keep your eyes closed.
I'm almost done.

335
00:26:30,266 --> 00:26:33,096
Okay, they're...
they're closed.

336
00:26:33,199 --> 00:26:35,290
They're shut.

337
00:26:35,399 --> 00:26:37,092
Good.

338
00:26:38,399 --> 00:26:44,729
So, you won, like, "Most Popular"
or "Best All-Around"

339
00:26:44,899 --> 00:26:48,229
or "Best Guy to Know," right?

340
00:26:48,366 --> 00:26:53,025
Uh, right, yeah.
It was just "Best All-Around. "

341
00:26:53,133 --> 00:26:55,564
So, you're a nice guy.

342
00:26:55,665 --> 00:26:57,824
I think so.

343
00:26:57,966 --> 00:27:01,454
Is that why you're here,
because you're nice to everyone?

344
00:27:03,432 --> 00:27:04,762
No.

345
00:27:19,398 --> 00:27:23,387
Okay, you don't look
like the prom king anymore.

346
00:27:24,398 --> 00:27:26,364
Oh, shit!

347
00:27:27,965 --> 00:27:29,431
My mom's gonna kill me.

348
00:27:29,532 --> 00:27:32,555
I think it suits you.

349
00:27:32,665 --> 00:27:33,631
Really?

350
00:27:33,731 --> 00:27:34,788
Yeah.

351
00:27:34,898 --> 00:27:36,159
You sure?

352
00:27:36,265 --> 00:27:38,094
Yeah.

353
00:27:41,499 --> 00:27:44,794
You're so pretty, Rose.

354
00:28:03,764 --> 00:28:06,252
Just let us know
if there's anything you can't eat.

355
00:28:06,364 --> 00:28:09,387
I can only imagine how sensitive
your stomach must be right now.

356
00:28:09,498 --> 00:28:12,157
Oh, I mostly just crave
bean burritos from Taco Bell.

357
00:28:13,264 --> 00:28:15,287
It was peanut butter
and bananas for Grace.

358
00:28:15,397 --> 00:28:16,488
- Really?
- Right?

359
00:28:16,598 --> 00:28:17,586
Right.

360
00:28:17,698 --> 00:28:19,288
When Grace delivered Ryan,

361
00:28:19,397 --> 00:28:21,761
we thought she was gonna
give birth to a banana split.

362
00:28:22,865 --> 00:28:25,626
That was Bennett, actually.

363
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:31,622
Ryan, how are you enjoying
your summer?

364
00:28:31,731 --> 00:28:32,991
Summer's over.

365
00:28:34,164 --> 00:28:36,687
Right.

366
00:28:36,797 --> 00:28:40,661
Don't know why I'm having
a hard time remembering that.

367
00:28:40,763 --> 00:28:43,752
Okay, here's another one.
How's school?

368
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,556
It's good.

369
00:28:45,663 --> 00:28:48,152
I got all the classes I wanted.

370
00:28:48,297 --> 00:28:50,660
Me and the guys hung out
after school, went swimming,

371
00:28:50,763 --> 00:28:52,786
and we might go see a movie later.

372
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:54,657
Excellent.

373
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:57,028
Why is it "excellent"?

374
00:28:57,164 --> 00:29:00,652
Well, seems like a nice way
to spend a day.

375
00:29:01,396 --> 00:29:04,294
All that's missing is a bean burrito.

376
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:17,962
I've got something for Rose.

377
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:19,562
Great. Let's see it.

378
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:20,787
So there's this Web site

379
00:29:20,897 --> 00:29:22,419
where you can take
two people's picture

380
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:24,928
and see what their unborn kid
looks like.

381
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:27,757
I took you and Bennett's
yearbook picture.

382
00:29:27,929 --> 00:29:28,952
According to them,

383
00:29:29,063 --> 00:29:31,791
your kid will definitely
be riding the short bus.

384
00:29:31,963 --> 00:29:34,088
- Ryan, that's not appropriate.
Let me see.

385
00:29:34,763 --> 00:29:36,990
Oh, look. Look!

386
00:29:37,163 --> 00:29:39,652
At least it sets the standards
pretty low, right?

387
00:29:39,829 --> 00:29:41,090
That's enough, Ryan.
Thank you.

388
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,355
You'll still love him, maybe.

389
00:29:42,463 --> 00:29:45,054
Look, he's got Bennett's eyes.

390
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:48,787
Anyone know if the weather's
gonna clear up for the weekend?

391
00:29:48,929 --> 00:29:51,327
Why do you do that? Why do you
always change the subject

392
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:52,827
when Bennett's name comes up?

393
00:29:52,996 --> 00:29:53,893
I don't.

394
00:29:54,063 --> 00:29:55,427
Yes, you do.

395
00:29:55,596 --> 00:29:58,062
- Grace.
- You do. Watch.

396
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,752
Did you dye our son's hair blue?

397
00:29:59,863 --> 00:30:01,726
Rose doesn't want to talk
about this at the table.

398
00:30:01,829 --> 00:30:03,556
- No, I...
- Why not? I just want to know.

399
00:30:03,662 --> 00:30:06,457
Grace, leave it alone.
Why make a point now?

400
00:30:06,562 --> 00:30:08,551
I'm not making a point.
I'm asking a question.

401
00:30:08,696 --> 00:30:11,491
Did you or did you not
dye our son's hair blue?

402
00:30:11,662 --> 00:30:12,593
I'm finished.

403
00:30:13,896 --> 00:30:14,725
Yes.

404
00:30:16,229 --> 00:30:18,195
You know,
when I went to the morgue,

405
00:30:18,295 --> 00:30:19,454
I didn't think it was him.

406
00:30:19,562 --> 00:30:21,460
I thought they got the wrong boy,

407
00:30:21,562 --> 00:30:24,722
because, I mean, our son
would never dye his hair blue.

408
00:30:24,863 --> 00:30:27,954
And I thought maybe
they made a mistake, and then...

409
00:30:28,162 --> 00:30:31,185
I saw his face, and...

410
00:30:31,295 --> 00:30:34,523
it was him, it was our son,

411
00:30:34,629 --> 00:30:37,992
and he was dead... again.

412
00:30:38,195 --> 00:30:41,922
It was like he died... twice.

413
00:30:42,562 --> 00:30:44,789
I'm sorry.

414
00:30:46,995 --> 00:30:49,154
You see, I didn't want
to make a point.

415
00:30:49,262 --> 00:30:52,558
I just... wanted to ask a question.

416
00:30:54,728 --> 00:30:56,422
I could come to your office hours,

417
00:30:56,529 --> 00:30:57,619
if that would be easier.

418
00:30:57,728 --> 00:31:01,354
No, no, don't do that, Dante.
Let's go again from the top.

419
00:31:01,461 --> 00:31:05,621
I'll come back tomorrow.
I'll just make an appointment.

420
00:31:12,862 --> 00:31:15,124
I'm fine.

421
00:31:15,229 --> 00:31:16,160
I'm fine.

422
00:31:18,394 --> 00:31:20,917
Maybe you should think
about taking a little more time off.

423
00:31:21,095 --> 00:31:22,958
I can find a midterm replacement.

424
00:31:23,062 --> 00:31:24,721
No, no. Don't do that. I'm fine.

425
00:31:24,828 --> 00:31:28,055
Just haven't had my morning coffee,
that's all.

426
00:31:30,928 --> 00:31:32,553
Will you have dinner
with me tonight?

427
00:31:32,661 --> 00:31:34,217
No strings attached.

428
00:31:34,328 --> 00:31:38,624
We used to be good friends.
Remember?

429
00:31:38,728 --> 00:31:42,751
L... I just need one night of sleep,
that's all.

430
00:31:42,861 --> 00:31:45,986
That's my problem.
I just need one night of sleep.

431
00:31:46,128 --> 00:31:48,720
What about the beach house?

432
00:31:48,827 --> 00:31:50,759
It certainly is a wonderful place

433
00:31:50,861 --> 00:31:54,157
to forget about the world
for a while.

434
00:31:56,727 --> 00:31:59,784
Grace loves the beach house.

435
00:32:01,827 --> 00:32:04,055
Right.

436
00:32:04,161 --> 00:32:07,752
Well, when Rick's mother died,

437
00:32:07,927 --> 00:32:09,950
I took the whole family
to Florida for two weeks.

438
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:12,289
It made a difference.

439
00:32:15,427 --> 00:32:19,917
I can't talk to you anymore.
You know that.

440
00:32:20,094 --> 00:32:24,549
I'm just trying to make sure
you're taking care of yourself.

441
00:32:25,061 --> 00:32:27,720
It's not always about Grace.

442
00:32:27,927 --> 00:32:30,222
Ryan, we're gonna go
to the beach house.

443
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,883
- When?
- I don't wanna hear about it.

444
00:32:31,994 --> 00:32:34,425
The decision's been made.
The whole family's going.

445
00:32:34,594 --> 00:32:36,822
I said, when?

446
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:40,790
Now. Today.

447
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,483
- Can I bring someone?
- Yeah. Sure. Who?

448
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:46,319
- Ashley.
- Fine. No drugs.

449
00:32:46,494 --> 00:32:49,187
Please, Dad. Why not?

450
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,688
I'm serious, Ryan. Okay?
Now help your mother pack.

451
00:32:52,793 --> 00:32:55,453
Do you think she wants a sample
before we go?

452
00:33:06,327 --> 00:33:08,190
Please, Grace.
Turn that off, would you?

453
00:33:08,327 --> 00:33:10,418
I don't understand
how the car crumpled like that.

454
00:33:10,526 --> 00:33:13,322
Maybe we should show this
to Bill again because, you know,

455
00:33:13,426 --> 00:33:15,654
maybe something was wrong
with the frame of the car.

456
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:17,725
There wasn't.

457
00:33:17,826 --> 00:33:20,451
And he gets out of his truck,

458
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,616
then he goes towards Bennett,
and he's...

459
00:33:22,726 --> 00:33:24,419
It looks like he speaks to him.
I mean, why...

460
00:33:24,526 --> 00:33:25,457
That's Ryan's sample.

461
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:27,525
If you want to test it,
he'd love you to test that.

462
00:33:27,626 --> 00:33:30,820
...talk to him.
And then he gives him his jacket.

463
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:35,187
Are you gonna
test the sample or not? Huh?

464
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,221
He was alive for 17 minutes.

465
00:33:40,326 --> 00:33:43,019
Aren't you just even
the slightest bit curious

466
00:33:43,126 --> 00:33:44,989
about what happened
in those 17 minutes?

467
00:33:45,092 --> 00:33:49,684
Oh, you know, maybe this is
a good time to stop the testing.

468
00:33:49,826 --> 00:33:52,291
You know?
I mean, Ryan's looking good.

469
00:33:52,392 --> 00:33:56,484
Best not push it.
What do you think?

470
00:33:56,593 --> 00:33:59,150
I think it's really important
to be consistent.

471
00:34:02,126 --> 00:34:03,921
All right.

472
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:08,716
I was just thinking that it's
too much for you, you know.

473
00:34:08,825 --> 00:34:11,485
It's fine. I'm fine. I can do it.

474
00:34:22,792 --> 00:34:25,917
You didn't take her
to the beach house, did you?

475
00:34:29,458 --> 00:34:31,924
Of course not.

476
00:34:37,458 --> 00:34:40,016
# Wrapped around each other #

477
00:34:41,091 --> 00:34:44,888
# Trying so hard to stay warm #

478
00:34:45,592 --> 00:34:48,387
# That first cold winter together #

479
00:34:50,758 --> 00:34:54,121
# Lying in each other's arms #

480
00:34:56,058 --> 00:34:59,218
# Watching those old movies #

481
00:34:59,391 --> 00:35:02,948
Mmm. This is a great song.

482
00:35:05,625 --> 00:35:07,988
Has anybody ever made love
to this song?

483
00:35:09,791 --> 00:35:11,689
Mom has.
She's laughing.

484
00:35:11,791 --> 00:35:14,485
# You were my leading lady #

485
00:35:14,657 --> 00:35:17,215
# We had it all #

486
00:35:19,258 --> 00:35:22,485
# Just like Bogie and Bacall #

487
00:35:23,724 --> 00:35:28,383
# Starring in our own late,
late show #

488
00:35:45,457 --> 00:35:48,321
Am I sitting on his bed?

489
00:35:48,424 --> 00:35:49,321
Yeah.

490
00:35:49,958 --> 00:35:51,446
- It's creepy.
- Yeah.

491
00:35:53,957 --> 00:35:55,116
Did you guys get along?

492
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:57,586
Uh... yeah.

493
00:35:57,757 --> 00:36:00,120
I mean, we did
when we were little.

494
00:36:00,224 --> 00:36:02,622
My mom says I used to follow him
around all the time.

495
00:36:02,724 --> 00:36:04,383
He is really cute.

496
00:36:04,491 --> 00:36:06,854
My mom thinks that he was
the greatest thing that ever lived,

497
00:36:06,957 --> 00:36:10,117
but, uh, he actually could be
a real cocksucker

498
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:12,313
when he wanted to.

499
00:36:12,457 --> 00:36:15,820
He won a lot of shit.

500
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:17,320
Yeah.

501
00:36:17,491 --> 00:36:19,457
Yeah, he did.

502
00:36:20,324 --> 00:36:22,290
You probably would have
wanted to date him.

503
00:36:22,457 --> 00:36:24,615
- No.
- Yeah, you would've.

504
00:36:24,723 --> 00:36:27,121
Trust me.
He had that effect on people.

505
00:36:27,224 --> 00:36:29,451
I think my mom even wanted
to date him sometimes.

506
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:33,947
What about you?

507
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:35,612
What about me?

508
00:36:35,756 --> 00:36:37,813
Who wants to date you?

509
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:42,587
I don't know.

510
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:43,986
Uh, you, maybe?

511
00:36:47,123 --> 00:36:48,919
Maybe.

512
00:36:52,456 --> 00:36:53,479
Gonna win!

513
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:56,920
Gonna beat you down there!
Then you're going in the water!

514
00:37:13,456 --> 00:37:16,944
Hi. Grace?
Do you have a minute?

515
00:37:17,056 --> 00:37:19,386
Uh, sure.

516
00:37:20,822 --> 00:37:23,754
Uh, I bought a book.

517
00:37:23,889 --> 00:37:26,253
I have this baby book,

518
00:37:26,356 --> 00:37:29,583
and there are so many questions
I don't know the answers to.

519
00:37:29,755 --> 00:37:32,812
And so, I was hoping you might
like to help me fill it out?

520
00:37:34,056 --> 00:37:35,544
Is now a bad time?

521
00:37:35,655 --> 00:37:37,382
It's fine.
What do you need?

522
00:37:37,489 --> 00:37:38,386
Um...

523
00:37:39,089 --> 00:37:41,680
Okay, let's see.

524
00:37:41,789 --> 00:37:43,550
Uh, his name.

525
00:37:43,655 --> 00:37:46,553
How did you come up
with Bennett's name?

526
00:37:46,655 --> 00:37:47,985
Tony Bennett.

527
00:37:48,155 --> 00:37:49,280
The singer?

528
00:37:49,455 --> 00:37:50,819
Mmm.

529
00:37:50,989 --> 00:37:52,477
Oh.

530
00:37:55,489 --> 00:37:57,785
I'm having a really hard time
thinking of baby names.

531
00:38:01,255 --> 00:38:04,346
Allen and I couldn't agree
on the girl's name.

532
00:38:04,455 --> 00:38:07,478
I wanted Ruby, and he wanted
something more traditional.

533
00:38:07,589 --> 00:38:11,112
Ruby. That's pretty.

534
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:13,085
So, I hope that helps you out.

535
00:38:13,188 --> 00:38:14,279
Do you wanna feel?

536
00:38:14,388 --> 00:38:16,751
You know, aren't you gonna go
swimming with everybody?

537
00:38:16,855 --> 00:38:19,617
He always kicks
when he hears your voice. Feel.

538
00:38:19,721 --> 00:38:22,552
- I'm fine, thanks.
- Please?

539
00:38:36,255 --> 00:38:37,948
It's strong.

540
00:38:38,122 --> 00:38:40,088
Yeah.

541
00:38:40,255 --> 00:38:42,550
Again.

542
00:38:47,921 --> 00:38:49,614
I never thought I'd get pregnant.

543
00:38:49,788 --> 00:38:52,151
I didn't even think
you could the first time.

544
00:38:52,254 --> 00:38:53,982
Who has that kind of luck?

545
00:38:55,988 --> 00:38:57,613
Think it was Bennett's first time?

546
00:38:57,788 --> 00:39:00,151
Yeah, I think so.

547
00:39:07,521 --> 00:39:09,487
It's funny, isn't it, that...

548
00:39:09,588 --> 00:39:11,985
you're the only one
who will talk about him with me?

549
00:39:12,154 --> 00:39:15,450
I'd love to, more than anything.
I have so many questions.

550
00:39:17,954 --> 00:39:20,580
I think you should go swimming.

551
00:39:21,654 --> 00:39:23,915
I'm Bennett.

552
00:39:24,087 --> 00:39:25,746
It's nice to meet you, Bennett.

553
00:39:25,854 --> 00:39:27,649
You too.

554
00:39:30,087 --> 00:39:31,575
- Okay.
- Hey, wait.

555
00:39:31,687 --> 00:39:34,619
- Where are you going to college?
- Barnard. You?

556
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,947
I thought you were going to N.Y.U.

557
00:39:36,054 --> 00:39:38,213
No, I'm going to Barnard.
They gave me a scholarship.

558
00:39:38,321 --> 00:39:39,184
All right. Great.

559
00:39:39,287 --> 00:39:41,150
Yeah, I'm going to Berkeley.

560
00:39:41,254 --> 00:39:43,549
No scholarship... yet.

561
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:52,719
I have to go to work
'cause I'm always really late.

562
00:39:52,854 --> 00:39:55,217
All right. Okay. Uh...

563
00:39:55,353 --> 00:39:57,216
Uh, please don't go.

564
00:39:57,353 --> 00:40:00,319
It's taken me, like, a year
to get the courage to talk to you.

565
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:03,284
Please don't go.

566
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:07,910
You've waited till 3:15
on the last day of school.

567
00:40:08,019 --> 00:40:12,213
Right. Yeah.
I never said I had good timing.

568
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,777
I have to go to work.

569
00:40:14,953 --> 00:40:18,386
Uh, can I maybe come...
Can I come with you?

570
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,645
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry. L...

571
00:40:22,752 --> 00:40:25,218
- Yeah.
- Yeah? You sure?

572
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,115
Yeah.

573
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:09,947
Ryan!

574
00:41:10,986 --> 00:41:11,974
Ryan!

575
00:41:13,652 --> 00:41:15,515
Ryan!

576
00:41:15,619 --> 00:41:16,585
Ryan!

577
00:41:16,686 --> 00:41:18,618
There's strong currents
out there! Back!

578
00:41:18,786 --> 00:41:20,809
Come out of the water!

579
00:41:20,985 --> 00:41:21,679
What?

580
00:41:21,786 --> 00:41:23,547
Don't question me!

581
00:41:23,719 --> 00:41:25,946
Don't! Just come out
of the water! Now!

582
00:41:26,119 --> 00:41:27,551
I know how to swim!

583
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:30,015
Goddamn it! Come out now!

584
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:32,449
Right now, and I mean it!

585
00:41:32,552 --> 00:41:36,745
Do you understand me?
Come out! Please!

586
00:41:36,852 --> 00:41:39,284
Goddamn it!
Come out now!

587
00:41:55,384 --> 00:41:56,372
What are you doing?

588
00:41:56,485 --> 00:41:58,678
You know what I was doing.
I know how to swim.

589
00:41:58,785 --> 00:42:00,876
You know better than that.

590
00:42:13,885 --> 00:42:15,578
Hey.

591
00:42:16,852 --> 00:42:18,078
Oh, hi. Hi.

592
00:42:18,184 --> 00:42:20,343
Hi.

593
00:42:20,451 --> 00:42:22,178
Did you swim?

594
00:42:23,718 --> 00:42:25,081
Yeah. Yeah, I...

595
00:42:25,184 --> 00:42:27,911
Yeah, I did. It was a...

596
00:42:28,017 --> 00:42:31,677
It was good. It was good.
A bit cold, but it was good.

597
00:42:32,718 --> 00:42:35,275
You okay?

598
00:42:35,384 --> 00:42:38,747
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.
I'm okay.

599
00:42:38,851 --> 00:42:40,147
Just fine.

600
00:42:41,551 --> 00:42:43,743
Nothing like an ocean breeze,
you know.

601
00:42:43,851 --> 00:42:47,783
I know. I always wanted
to live by the ocean.

602
00:42:47,884 --> 00:42:49,782
My mom thought it was
too close to the moon.

603
00:42:49,884 --> 00:42:50,747
Oh, that's a good one.

604
00:42:50,851 --> 00:42:52,510
Doesn't make any sense.

605
00:42:52,617 --> 00:42:53,605
No, not really.

606
00:42:53,784 --> 00:42:56,375
You know, your mother
is more than welcome

607
00:42:56,484 --> 00:42:58,416
to come and stay with us
if she wants.

608
00:42:58,517 --> 00:43:01,677
That wouldn't work.
My mom's not really sane.

609
00:43:01,784 --> 00:43:04,944
Oh, I don't think that would
scare anyone in our house.

610
00:43:06,051 --> 00:43:09,642
The truth is,
I haven't told her I'm pregnant.

611
00:43:14,317 --> 00:43:16,408
Why not?

612
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:20,380
Because she'll... she'll tell me
I've chosen the wrong path.

613
00:43:20,517 --> 00:43:22,483
I don't wanna hear that.

614
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:25,878
I don't think you've chosen
the wrong path.

615
00:43:26,016 --> 00:43:29,414
I'm not 100% sure why you chose it,
but I'm not sorry you did.

616
00:43:29,517 --> 00:43:30,948
I know there are other options.

617
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:33,414
Listen, we would have
supported you either way.

618
00:43:33,517 --> 00:43:34,880
I'm not against any of them.

619
00:43:35,016 --> 00:43:36,039
It's... Of course not.

620
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:38,139
It's just...
I don't know.

621
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:39,238
You don't have to...

622
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:40,509
No, I do know.

623
00:43:40,617 --> 00:43:43,810
Come here. Come here.
You don't have to know.

624
00:43:43,916 --> 00:43:46,109
You don't have to know.
It's okay.

625
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:49,444
We can talk about this
at another time and...

626
00:43:49,583 --> 00:43:52,640
Should we catch a movie?

627
00:44:03,449 --> 00:44:05,211
Ryan!

628
00:44:06,549 --> 00:44:08,310
Allen!

629
00:44:17,716 --> 00:44:19,944
Do you wanna see
my only party trick?

630
00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:20,674
Sure.

631
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:23,271
Okay. Hold that.

632
00:44:24,483 --> 00:44:26,142
Mm-hmm.

633
00:44:30,649 --> 00:44:31,842
Look at that.

634
00:44:33,416 --> 00:44:34,347
That's good.

635
00:44:34,449 --> 00:44:36,381
I've never actually
done that at a party.

636
00:44:36,516 --> 00:44:39,482
I wonder how that comes up
organically.

637
00:44:39,583 --> 00:44:42,105
Do you have any party tricks?

638
00:44:43,949 --> 00:44:45,279
Um...

639
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:48,870
I don't know if it counts,
but I never forget people's numbers.

640
00:44:49,015 --> 00:44:53,311
Hmm.
I... tend to memorize numbers.

641
00:44:53,483 --> 00:44:56,573
What are my numbers?

642
00:44:56,682 --> 00:45:03,377
Well, you have 18 years,
216 months, 864 weeks,

643
00:45:03,515 --> 00:45:06,209
25,920 days,

644
00:45:06,381 --> 00:45:11,212
311,040 hours.

645
00:45:11,315 --> 00:45:13,508
You came to our doorstep

646
00:45:13,648 --> 00:45:18,740
on 8-14-2008 at 4:30 p. m.

647
00:45:18,849 --> 00:45:23,213
Your due date is 2-12-2009,

648
00:45:23,381 --> 00:45:27,643
which leaves 119 more days,

649
00:45:27,782 --> 00:45:30,612
2,136 hours,

650
00:45:30,748 --> 00:45:35,442
128,160 minutes.

651
00:45:37,381 --> 00:45:40,472
And you have two heartbeats.

652
00:45:41,881 --> 00:45:45,177
As I get to know you,
I'll tell you more.

653
00:45:47,381 --> 00:45:50,541
That's a much better party trick.

654
00:45:56,914 --> 00:46:00,846
Price check
on register four, please.

655
00:46:08,914 --> 00:46:11,244
Jesus Christ!

656
00:46:13,414 --> 00:46:15,346
What happened?
Where's Grace?

657
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:16,970
She's fine.
She's out back, waiting.

658
00:46:17,081 --> 00:46:18,671
- My son?
- He's upstairs. He's fine.

659
00:46:18,781 --> 00:46:20,077
Okay.
What, exactly, happened?

660
00:46:20,181 --> 00:46:21,942
Your wife had a difficult time
at a grocery store

661
00:46:22,048 --> 00:46:23,274
and needed assistance.

662
00:46:23,414 --> 00:46:24,437
- And she's out the back?
- Yes.

663
00:46:24,547 --> 00:46:27,843
All right, thank you, officer.
This is Rose.

664
00:46:34,781 --> 00:46:36,144
Are you all right?

665
00:46:36,247 --> 00:46:38,406
I called a taxi.

666
00:46:38,514 --> 00:46:39,878
Why didn't you call me?

667
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:41,809
'Cause your phone was off.

668
00:46:43,047 --> 00:46:46,275
I'm sorry.
I was at the movies.

669
00:46:48,247 --> 00:46:50,008
You went to the movies?

670
00:46:50,114 --> 00:46:52,273
Yes, with Rose.

671
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:54,743
It was nice to get out.

672
00:47:00,447 --> 00:47:02,470
Well, how could you
turn your phone off?

673
00:47:02,646 --> 00:47:05,703
Grace, it was only
a couple of hours.

674
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:08,744
But anything can happen
in a couple of hours. Anything.

675
00:47:11,047 --> 00:47:12,876
What happened
at the grocery store?

676
00:47:13,913 --> 00:47:16,209
Was it a funny movie?
I mean, did you laugh?

677
00:47:16,379 --> 00:47:19,005
Or was it sad?
Did you cry?

678
00:47:19,114 --> 00:47:19,943
Ouch.

679
00:47:20,047 --> 00:47:23,274
Oh, God, Allen, don't do that.
I can't stand that "ouch" thing.

680
00:47:23,379 --> 00:47:24,208
Ouch.

681
00:47:24,313 --> 00:47:26,541
Really. I'm warning you.
Don't start with that.

682
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:29,044
I just wanna know what happened
at the grocery store. That's all.

683
00:47:29,146 --> 00:47:30,271
Well, I've got an idea for you.

684
00:47:30,379 --> 00:47:31,777
Why don't the two of you,
you and Rose,

685
00:47:31,947 --> 00:47:34,936
go off to Paris or Rome
or somewhere really romantic

686
00:47:35,046 --> 00:47:39,103
and just get a vacation
from all this death?

687
00:47:39,279 --> 00:47:41,541
Hey, hey.
That's not fair.

688
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,805
No, you know what's not fair?

689
00:47:43,946 --> 00:47:48,345
It's not fair that you can go
to the movies with her

690
00:47:48,446 --> 00:47:50,934
and I can't even pass
Bennett's favorite cereal.

691
00:47:51,079 --> 00:47:52,602
Come on, Grace, please.

692
00:47:52,713 --> 00:47:53,973
Just don't... don't do this.

693
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:55,602
- Don't... Just don't...
- Allen, stop it.

694
00:47:55,745 --> 00:47:58,143
- Goddamn it!
- Allen!

695
00:48:00,679 --> 00:48:02,645
Allen! Where are you going?

696
00:48:02,745 --> 00:48:04,768
No, don't!

697
00:48:08,612 --> 00:48:11,578
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

698
00:48:11,712 --> 00:48:14,270
Let me help you.
Let me help you.

699
00:48:21,046 --> 00:48:23,910
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

700
00:48:24,046 --> 00:48:26,409
I'm so sorry.

701
00:48:26,545 --> 00:48:27,340
I'm sorry.

702
00:48:29,179 --> 00:48:32,235
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

703
00:48:32,378 --> 00:48:36,174
I'm so sorry.
I really am sorry.

704
00:48:40,445 --> 00:48:42,843
I love you. I love you.

705
00:48:42,979 --> 00:48:46,035
I love you. I love you.

706
00:48:48,911 --> 00:48:53,139
Grace, I love you and no one else.
Do you understand me?

707
00:49:52,578 --> 00:49:53,941
I'm sorry.

708
00:49:54,044 --> 00:49:56,067
I'm so sorry I was gone so long.

709
00:49:56,211 --> 00:49:57,870
But I'm back now.

710
00:49:57,977 --> 00:50:00,170
And, oh, wonderful. Look.

711
00:50:00,311 --> 00:50:03,175
They can't even follow
the simplest instructions.

712
00:50:03,311 --> 00:50:07,766
How many times have I told them
that you need the light?

713
00:50:07,877 --> 00:50:13,139
But okay. Enough of that.
Let's read our Ellison again.

714
00:50:13,244 --> 00:50:15,335
I don't even remember
where we are.

715
00:50:15,478 --> 00:50:19,842
Is it the seventh
or the eighth chapter?

716
00:50:19,977 --> 00:50:21,840
Let's see.

717
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:23,499
Eighth chapter.

718
00:50:23,643 --> 00:50:26,666
You know, we're gonna finish
this whole summer reading list,

719
00:50:26,810 --> 00:50:28,776
which is a first.

720
00:50:29,577 --> 00:50:31,271
And I gotta tell you
that the high-school one

721
00:50:31,376 --> 00:50:33,399
is much more boring
than the college.

722
00:50:33,510 --> 00:50:35,806
Okay. Where were we?
Let's see.

723
00:50:35,910 --> 00:50:38,001
"He started toward me
as in a dream,

724
00:50:38,111 --> 00:50:40,009
trembling like the needle
of one of the gauges

725
00:50:40,111 --> 00:50:42,975
as he pointed toward the stairs,
his voice shrieking.

726
00:50:43,077 --> 00:50:46,270
I stared. Something seemed
to have gone wrong.

727
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:50,206
My reflexes"...

728
00:50:50,310 --> 00:50:56,106
You know, Allen...
he hasn't always been like this.

729
00:50:56,210 --> 00:50:59,836
I don't want you to judge him.
He's actually a very kind man.

730
00:50:59,976 --> 00:51:02,033
And you would see that
if you met him.

731
00:51:02,210 --> 00:51:08,109
He's never loved anyone less
than he should. Never.

732
00:51:10,310 --> 00:51:12,071
I want you to know that.

733
00:51:21,176 --> 00:51:24,336
It's just a phase. It's a phase
that we're going through. That's all.

734
00:51:24,477 --> 00:51:26,443
Just like any other.

735
00:51:26,542 --> 00:51:30,134
"'What's the matter? ', I stammered,
my voice low and my"...

736
00:51:30,243 --> 00:51:31,469
He's all yours.

737
00:51:31,609 --> 00:51:33,768
Wait, what's going on?
Wait a minute. What?

738
00:51:33,909 --> 00:51:36,670
- Mr. Walker's being moved.
- What? Where? Why?

739
00:51:36,776 --> 00:51:38,901
Mr. Walker has warrants
out for his arrest.

740
00:51:39,009 --> 00:51:41,941
We're taking him to County Hospital,
where there's 24-hour security.

741
00:51:42,043 --> 00:51:43,702
- Must be a mistake.
- There is no mistake.

742
00:51:43,843 --> 00:51:46,400
Stop it! What about all his things?
You... You...

743
00:51:46,576 --> 00:51:48,371
He's not gonna need any
of his things where he's going.

744
00:51:48,476 --> 00:51:50,533
He's gonna be so terrified
if he wakes up and doesn't have his...

745
00:51:50,676 --> 00:51:52,574
What do you think this kind of man
is gonna add to your life?

746
00:51:52,676 --> 00:51:53,505
Stop it! No...

747
00:51:53,609 --> 00:51:56,268
The minute he wakes up,
if he wakes up,

748
00:51:56,442 --> 00:51:58,465
he's being shipped
straight to Rikers.

749
00:51:58,642 --> 00:52:00,301
Are you gonna visit him there, too?

750
00:52:48,274 --> 00:52:50,467
I think Grace might be
having an affair.

751
00:52:52,208 --> 00:52:53,538
No.

752
00:52:53,708 --> 00:52:56,469
I wouldn't blame her if she was.

753
00:52:56,641 --> 00:52:58,539
I don't think she would do that.

754
00:53:02,408 --> 00:53:04,397
I did.

755
00:53:05,842 --> 00:53:07,831
I had one.

756
00:53:15,441 --> 00:53:17,634
I needed to know
that she loved me.

757
00:53:19,707 --> 00:53:24,538
Our entire married life,
I've always felt like...

758
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:27,834
we were on our first date.

759
00:53:27,941 --> 00:53:29,566
Hmm.

760
00:53:33,707 --> 00:53:36,071
I never deserved her.

761
00:53:36,907 --> 00:53:38,634
Never.

762
00:53:44,907 --> 00:53:46,463
Do you want to go
to a party with me?

763
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,168
There's three kegs.

764
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,570
- I don't think I'm dressed for this.
- Oh, don't worry.

765
00:54:02,674 --> 00:54:05,640
These people are
pretty nonjudgmental.

766
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:11,470
Oh, my God! You're huge!

767
00:54:12,307 --> 00:54:15,569
I didn't think it was possible
for you to stretch like that.

768
00:54:15,707 --> 00:54:18,298
Shea, this is Allen.
Allen, this is Shea.

769
00:54:18,407 --> 00:54:19,373
Hi. How are you?

770
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:21,267
Hi. Nice to meet you.

771
00:54:21,407 --> 00:54:23,134
Wait. You guys did realize
this was

772
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:26,400
a "Wear Something You'd Never
Be Caught Dead In" party, right?

773
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:29,404
No. But I'm wearing Grace's
old maternity clothes,

774
00:54:29,507 --> 00:54:30,733
so that kinda works out.

775
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:32,806
- And you?
- This is it.

776
00:54:34,073 --> 00:54:36,301
Well, you're actually
kind of perfect, so...

777
00:54:36,407 --> 00:54:37,531
Come on in.

778
00:54:37,706 --> 00:54:39,535
Come in.

779
00:54:39,706 --> 00:54:42,070
- Yeah, man!
- Oh, boy.

780
00:54:42,173 --> 00:54:44,570
- Right on.
- Oh...

781
00:54:44,773 --> 00:54:45,864
Hey, hey.

782
00:54:47,573 --> 00:54:50,903
I wouldn't be caught dead naked!

783
00:54:51,073 --> 00:54:52,766
Yeah!

784
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:57,802
Hey, um, are you a pregnant teen
or something?

785
00:54:57,906 --> 00:54:59,929
Yeah, I am.

786
00:55:00,107 --> 00:55:02,039
Do you live under a freeway

787
00:55:02,139 --> 00:55:03,867
and are gonna have
a homeless baby

788
00:55:03,973 --> 00:55:06,268
and use it to raise more money?

789
00:55:06,439 --> 00:55:08,530
No, I'm just a regular
pregnant teen.

790
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:10,730
Oh. Right on!

791
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:13,704
I wouldn't be caught dead
having a baby!

792
00:55:15,639 --> 00:55:18,730
Hey, is it okay if I just
come a little closer?

793
00:55:18,905 --> 00:55:22,167
Sit next to you guys for a second?
I just... I gotta tell you something.

794
00:55:27,905 --> 00:55:31,269
Dude, I'm on acid.

795
00:55:31,439 --> 00:55:33,836
I'm trippin', y'all.

796
00:55:33,972 --> 00:55:36,234
That's the way
Britney Spears would say it.

797
00:55:36,339 --> 00:55:38,066
She'd be like,
"I'm trippin', y'all. "

798
00:55:39,206 --> 00:55:40,263
- We can go somewhere else.
- Yeah.

799
00:55:40,439 --> 00:55:42,098
No, wait, wait.
Dude, wait. Stay.

800
00:55:42,206 --> 00:55:44,763
Say something familiar, man, please.
Just say something familiar.

801
00:55:44,905 --> 00:55:46,394
I'm just seeing too many ghosts.

802
00:55:50,172 --> 00:55:52,035
I don't know.
French fries.

803
00:55:52,206 --> 00:55:54,569
Yeah!

804
00:55:54,738 --> 00:55:58,034
- Mr. Bubble.
- Yeah.

805
00:56:00,172 --> 00:56:01,228
Monkeys.

806
00:56:02,505 --> 00:56:05,403
The ones that rip your balls off
for not sharing birthday cake,

807
00:56:05,505 --> 00:56:06,801
or the nice ones?

808
00:56:06,972 --> 00:56:08,767
No. The nice ones.

809
00:56:08,905 --> 00:56:10,564
Yeah!

810
00:56:24,772 --> 00:56:26,135
What... That's...

811
00:56:29,105 --> 00:56:30,002
"Go, baby, go. "

812
00:56:31,138 --> 00:56:33,104
Yeah!
Let's go.

813
00:56:33,271 --> 00:56:34,430
All right. Let's go.

814
00:56:35,605 --> 00:56:38,230
Bye.

815
00:56:38,938 --> 00:56:39,904
What'd you do?

816
00:56:40,004 --> 00:56:42,163
People signed my belly.

817
00:56:42,305 --> 00:56:42,998
Oh.

818
00:56:43,105 --> 00:56:45,435
It seemed sweet at the time.

819
00:56:45,571 --> 00:56:49,526
"Have a great summer.
Good luck with the new kid. "

820
00:56:51,504 --> 00:56:54,868
I was never into yearbooks.
Do you want to sign?

821
00:56:55,038 --> 00:56:58,333
Um... all right.

822
00:57:18,104 --> 00:57:19,695
Don't you think it might
just be easier

823
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:22,268
if you talked about it with Grace?

824
00:57:28,270 --> 00:57:30,327
Floodgates.

825
00:57:32,104 --> 00:57:34,899
I don't know what I'd do
if they opened.

826
00:57:37,037 --> 00:57:41,799
I'll talk about someone,
but it'll really be him.

827
00:57:42,437 --> 00:57:43,868
Why would you do that?

828
00:57:44,037 --> 00:57:46,628
Because there are things
I need to tell you.

829
00:57:49,736 --> 00:57:50,963
Okay.

830
00:57:51,070 --> 00:57:52,558
Okay.

831
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:56,534
I knew this boy.

832
00:57:56,670 --> 00:57:58,898
He was really wonderful to me.

833
00:57:59,070 --> 00:58:00,695
Is that okay?

834
00:58:01,536 --> 00:58:03,525
Yes.

835
00:58:03,636 --> 00:58:08,092
The first time I saw him
was in freshman English.

836
00:58:08,236 --> 00:58:10,930
He wore a baseball hat
on the first day of school,

837
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:13,036
and our teacher made him
take it off.

838
00:58:13,203 --> 00:58:17,465
And his hair was all pasted
on top of his head.

839
00:58:17,603 --> 00:58:20,068
And he smiled at me
while he tried to fix it.

840
00:58:20,236 --> 00:58:23,794
We watched each other after that.

841
00:58:23,903 --> 00:58:27,335
And I started to feel
like I knew him.

842
00:58:27,436 --> 00:58:29,402
I looked at his
yearbook picture so often,

843
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:32,196
I knew his face by heart.

844
00:58:32,303 --> 00:58:35,360
Our senior year, I took piano,

845
00:58:35,503 --> 00:58:37,366
and he had soccer,

846
00:58:37,503 --> 00:58:40,060
so we would pass each other
every day after school

847
00:58:40,203 --> 00:58:43,691
in the exact same spot.

848
00:58:43,936 --> 00:58:48,266
And it became something
I looked forward to,

849
00:58:48,436 --> 00:58:50,924
so much so that I could tell you
all the days he was absent,

850
00:58:51,036 --> 00:58:53,661
because those were the days
that I was disappointed.

851
00:58:53,769 --> 00:58:55,894
And sometimes
he would look at me.

852
00:58:56,069 --> 00:59:00,728
Sometimes he would turn away.

853
00:59:00,836 --> 00:59:03,996
And sometimes
it would be so intense

854
00:59:04,103 --> 00:59:05,659
that we would start looking
at each other

855
00:59:05,769 --> 00:59:09,496
from the very beginning
of the steps.

856
00:59:10,702 --> 00:59:13,532
And then on the last day,

857
00:59:13,635 --> 00:59:16,226
he talked to me.

858
00:59:17,136 --> 00:59:22,158
And everything he said was exactly
how I pictured it would be.

859
00:59:24,002 --> 00:59:26,467
And he felt the way he felt
in my dreams,

860
00:59:26,569 --> 00:59:29,364
and I thought everything
was happening

861
00:59:29,469 --> 00:59:33,492
exactly the way
it was supposed to.

862
00:59:35,635 --> 00:59:37,760
And I was the happiest
I've ever been...

863
00:59:37,868 --> 00:59:41,699
happy and scared
all at the same time.

864
00:59:43,368 --> 00:59:44,595
And if he had signed my belly,

865
00:59:44,702 --> 00:59:46,395
he would have written
something comforting.

866
00:59:53,901 --> 00:59:57,197
That's one of the most
difficult integrals

867
00:59:57,302 --> 01:00:00,325
I've ever solved.

868
01:00:01,302 --> 01:00:04,665
Took me three years to do it.

869
01:00:05,801 --> 01:00:08,824
And I was in love with him.

870
01:00:11,968 --> 01:00:14,559
That's why I'm keeping this baby.

871
01:00:14,734 --> 01:00:18,689
I was in love with him
for four years.

872
01:00:20,135 --> 01:00:22,532
I barely knew him,

873
01:00:22,668 --> 01:00:26,395
but everything
was exactly how I imagined it.

874
01:00:26,501 --> 01:00:31,524
Everything was
just how I pictured it.

875
01:00:31,701 --> 01:00:34,394
And I have to keep this baby.

876
01:00:36,401 --> 01:00:40,163
I think he was the love of my life.

877
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,932
I'm very tired.

878
01:01:13,101 --> 01:01:16,533
I can't fight it anymore.

879
01:01:20,667 --> 01:01:23,189
I'm so tired.

880
01:02:10,966 --> 01:02:13,989
My mom says it's cool.
Yeah.

881
01:02:15,933 --> 01:02:17,899
That was a good story.

882
01:02:18,033 --> 01:02:19,294
Thanks.

883
01:02:19,399 --> 01:02:21,263
No, I mean... I don't...
I don't mean it that way.

884
01:02:21,365 --> 01:02:23,025
I mean, it was good to hear.

885
01:02:23,166 --> 01:02:26,427
Not good for you,
but good for me, I guess.

886
01:02:27,499 --> 01:02:29,988
So what was
your brother's funeral like?

887
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:31,793
I don't remember.

888
01:02:31,899 --> 01:02:32,922
It's all just a blur?

889
01:02:33,033 --> 01:02:36,726
No, I really don't remember.
I was too fucked up.

890
01:02:36,866 --> 01:02:38,855
I didn't know you get high.

891
01:02:38,999 --> 01:02:40,521
I don't.

892
01:02:40,632 --> 01:02:42,757
My mom tests me every two weeks.

893
01:02:42,866 --> 01:02:44,764
It's pretty much
the only thing they do

894
01:02:44,866 --> 01:02:47,525
that proves they know I'm alive.

895
01:02:48,632 --> 01:02:50,598
Need a ride home?

896
01:02:50,699 --> 01:02:51,687
Yeah, sure.

897
01:02:54,566 --> 01:02:56,395
Baby is head down,

898
01:02:56,499 --> 01:02:59,953
which means
you're getting very close.

899
01:03:00,065 --> 01:03:02,122
How are you feeling,
Mr. Brewer?

900
01:03:03,299 --> 01:03:06,594
You look like
you could use some rest.

901
01:03:06,731 --> 01:03:09,788
Oh, I'm fine.
Thank you.

902
01:03:10,698 --> 01:03:12,460
How's the baby?

903
01:03:12,598 --> 01:03:15,564
Just where we want her
to be right now.

904
01:03:15,665 --> 01:03:16,722
It's a girl?

905
01:03:16,898 --> 01:03:19,023
I'm sorry.
I thought you knew.

906
01:03:19,199 --> 01:03:20,687
It's a girl?

907
01:03:20,865 --> 01:03:23,127
Oh, congratulations.

908
01:03:24,165 --> 01:03:25,926
Is she healthy?

909
01:03:26,099 --> 01:03:28,190
Doesn't get any stronger
than that heartbeat.

910
01:03:28,331 --> 01:03:30,559
You've taken
really good care of her.

911
01:03:30,731 --> 01:03:32,027
Oh, this is wonderful.

912
01:03:34,099 --> 01:03:38,622
This is wonderful.
Wonderful.

913
01:03:38,798 --> 01:03:41,696
Excuse me.

914
01:03:41,798 --> 01:03:44,195
It's wonderful.

915
01:03:44,331 --> 01:03:46,661
Okay. I'll be right back.

916
01:03:46,798 --> 01:03:49,355
A girl.
A girl. Okay.

917
01:04:01,931 --> 01:04:03,863
What is wrong with you?

918
01:04:03,997 --> 01:04:05,395
I just need a minute.

919
01:04:05,498 --> 01:04:07,725
So, take a minute.
I'm going back in.

920
01:04:07,831 --> 01:04:09,229
No.

921
01:04:10,198 --> 01:04:14,789
I don't want this baby, Allen.
I don't care if I sound horrible.

922
01:04:14,931 --> 01:04:16,090
You sound horrible.

923
01:04:16,198 --> 01:04:18,595
If Bennett were alive,
she never would have kept it.

924
01:04:18,697 --> 01:04:20,492
- I can't be grateful to her.
- You don't have to be.

925
01:04:20,597 --> 01:04:21,393
- I won't.
- Fine.

926
01:04:21,497 --> 01:04:22,929
- I won't do it. I won't.
- Don't. Don't.

927
01:04:23,031 --> 01:04:26,327
Don't do anything.
I don't care anymore.

928
01:04:26,430 --> 01:04:28,919
Don't I have the right
to tell you how I'm feeling?

929
01:04:30,164 --> 01:04:33,254
Not when everything you say
is sounding so ugly.

930
01:04:33,430 --> 01:04:34,953
You're right.
Losing a child is ugly.

931
01:04:35,064 --> 01:04:36,927
You don't have a patent on grief.

932
01:04:37,031 --> 01:04:38,758
You're not the only one
who knows how to do it.

933
01:04:38,864 --> 01:04:40,727
- Other people grieve.
- You don't.

934
01:04:40,831 --> 01:04:42,626
- You haven't shed a tear once.
- I'm gonna go back in.

935
01:04:42,730 --> 01:04:44,662
You used to get misty when
you would go to his sports events.

936
01:04:44,764 --> 01:04:46,559
Listen. Somebody has to
stand strong in this family.

937
01:04:46,664 --> 01:04:48,061
Somebody has to be together.

938
01:04:48,230 --> 01:04:50,355
If I fall apart, everything
goes to hell in a handbasket.

939
01:04:50,464 --> 01:04:53,123
Well, I am so sorry that I can't
handle anything but my grief,

940
01:04:53,230 --> 01:04:55,423
and I don't treat this family
like a goddamn army.

941
01:04:55,530 --> 01:04:57,995
It's not all about you
and your grief, Grace.

942
01:04:58,130 --> 01:05:01,290
There are people in our lives
who need our attention.

943
01:05:01,464 --> 01:05:04,123
Well, you don't give a puppy
to someone who's just lost their dog.

944
01:05:04,230 --> 01:05:05,526
You just don't do that.

945
01:05:05,630 --> 01:05:08,118
So what do we do?
Give her back? Hmm?

946
01:05:08,230 --> 01:05:09,786
Give her 20 bucks?
Wish her luck?

947
01:05:09,896 --> 01:05:12,419
Don't praise her like she's a gift
that was given to us,

948
01:05:12,530 --> 01:05:14,859
like it makes it okay
that our son is gone.

949
01:05:14,996 --> 01:05:16,621
It doesn't soften the blow.

950
01:05:16,796 --> 01:05:18,194
She does for me.

951
01:05:20,796 --> 01:05:22,387
Yeah.

952
01:05:22,563 --> 01:05:24,154
Oh, well, I'm so glad for you.

953
01:05:24,263 --> 01:05:27,786
I'm so glad that the girl that is
the reason our son is dead

954
01:05:27,896 --> 01:05:29,521
softens the blow for you.

955
01:05:29,696 --> 01:05:30,719
That's unfair.

956
01:05:30,830 --> 01:05:33,194
What was he doing
in the middle of the road?

957
01:05:33,362 --> 01:05:35,090
If he'd been with his friends,
if he'd been with us,

958
01:05:35,230 --> 01:05:36,923
would he have been
in the middle of the road?

959
01:05:37,030 --> 01:05:37,893
Answer me that.

960
01:05:37,996 --> 01:05:39,552
You don't know anything about it.

961
01:05:39,729 --> 01:05:43,161
You haven't made the slightest
effort to get to know this girl.

962
01:05:43,296 --> 01:05:45,762
I don't want to get to know her.
Why can't you understand that?

963
01:05:45,863 --> 01:05:47,488
It should have been her
that died that night.

964
01:05:47,596 --> 01:05:48,584
It should have been her!

965
01:06:19,262 --> 01:06:20,887
Hello?

966
01:06:21,962 --> 01:06:24,019
- Hi.
- Can I help you?

967
01:06:24,129 --> 01:06:27,617
Yeah. Ashley left
this scarf in my car.

968
01:06:27,795 --> 01:06:30,556
Um, who are you?

969
01:06:30,728 --> 01:06:33,354
I'm Amy. I live here.

970
01:06:33,528 --> 01:06:36,551
- Amy.
- Yeah.

971
01:06:38,162 --> 01:06:41,457
Ashley's older sister Amy?

972
01:06:43,595 --> 01:06:47,050
What'd she tell you?
I grabbed a live wire?

973
01:06:47,161 --> 01:06:49,354
Fell overboard
on our family cruise?

974
01:06:49,528 --> 01:06:50,926
What'd you tell him this time,
you freak?

975
01:06:51,029 --> 01:06:52,119
- Ryan...
- I'm telling Mom.

976
01:06:52,228 --> 01:06:53,353
- I hate you!
- Freak.

977
01:06:53,462 --> 01:06:56,622
Ryan! Ryan, please.
Wait. I can explain.

978
01:06:56,728 --> 01:06:58,523
- Ryan, please just listen to me!
- Uh-uh.

979
01:06:58,628 --> 01:07:00,526
Look. They don't pay
any attention to me in there.

980
01:07:00,628 --> 01:07:02,753
- I might as well be dead.
- You have no idea what it's like.

981
01:07:02,895 --> 01:07:05,087
- Yes, I do. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- No, you don't. No, you don't.

982
01:07:05,195 --> 01:07:06,956
You're a liar!
That's what you are!

983
01:07:07,095 --> 01:07:08,459
Look, it's all bad! Trust me!

984
01:07:08,562 --> 01:07:10,891
You have no idea what it's like!

985
01:07:11,061 --> 01:07:14,221
Say it! Say you have no idea
what it's like.

986
01:07:15,894 --> 01:07:18,520
I have no idea.

987
01:07:18,628 --> 01:07:19,888
Open the gate.

988
01:07:19,994 --> 01:07:21,324
Open the fucking gate!

989
01:07:21,428 --> 01:07:23,791
Ryan, look, please. I'm sorry.
I just wanted you to like me.

990
01:07:23,961 --> 01:07:25,620
Fuck you!

991
01:07:29,894 --> 01:07:31,519
Hello?

992
01:07:34,561 --> 01:07:36,118
Hello?

993
01:08:13,394 --> 01:08:18,656
# Wanderers this morning came by #

994
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:19,783
# Where did they go? #

995
01:08:19,893 --> 01:08:22,791
- What have you done?
- I called Gloria.

996
01:08:22,927 --> 01:08:24,484
You said we were
gonna talk about it!

997
01:08:24,594 --> 01:08:26,526
I couldn't live with the house
so neglected.

998
01:08:26,626 --> 01:08:29,184
Now, come on.
Please. Hey!

999
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:30,723
- Idiot!
- What is wrong with you, Grace?

1000
01:08:30,827 --> 01:08:32,191
- How could you do this?
- Come here a second.

1001
01:08:32,294 --> 01:08:33,554
Wait. Whoa. Whoa.
What is this?

1002
01:08:33,660 --> 01:08:34,523
Hey! Grace.

1003
01:08:34,626 --> 01:08:36,922
- You washed his shirt?
- Yeah.

1004
01:08:37,027 --> 01:08:39,118
- You're fired! Get out of here!
- Don't do this! Grace!

1005
01:08:39,227 --> 01:08:40,590
What are you doing?
Stop it!

1006
01:08:40,693 --> 01:08:41,352
I'm sorry.

1007
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:43,154
Grace.

1008
01:08:43,260 --> 01:08:45,487
You've erased him.
You did it on purpose.

1009
01:08:45,593 --> 01:08:47,150
What are you doing?
You're acting like a child.

1010
01:08:47,260 --> 01:08:48,486
I've done nothing like that at all.

1011
01:08:48,593 --> 01:08:52,151
I wanted to be able to see
his pictures and to smell him

1012
01:08:52,259 --> 01:08:53,350
now that he's gone.

1013
01:08:53,460 --> 01:08:54,721
Grace, he's here.

1014
01:08:54,893 --> 01:08:56,688
He isn't here!
He's dead! He's gone!

1015
01:08:56,793 --> 01:08:58,486
I know that, goddamn it!

1016
01:08:58,593 --> 01:08:59,820
Don't you...
Don't...

1017
01:08:59,927 --> 01:09:02,449
There's nothing to hold on to!
Don't you understand that?

1018
01:09:02,660 --> 01:09:06,251
Just shed one tear.

1019
01:09:06,359 --> 01:09:10,758
I mean, what is wrong with you?
Can't you just cry one tear?

1020
01:09:11,026 --> 01:09:14,186
# Dear shadow alive and well #

1021
01:09:16,126 --> 01:09:19,354
# How can the body die? #

1022
01:09:20,493 --> 01:09:24,255
# You tell me everything #

1023
01:09:24,359 --> 01:09:25,450
# Anything #

1024
01:09:26,792 --> 01:09:29,258
Allen? Allen?

1025
01:09:30,026 --> 01:09:32,890
Allen? I'm s... I'm sorry.

1026
01:09:34,625 --> 01:09:37,750
# Into town one morning I went #

1027
01:09:37,859 --> 01:09:39,552
Oh, my God, Allen.

1028
01:09:39,659 --> 01:09:44,819
# Staggering through
premonitions of my death #

1029
01:09:44,926 --> 01:09:47,653
# I don't see #

1030
01:09:49,259 --> 01:09:50,282
Mrs. Brewer?

1031
01:09:59,258 --> 01:10:01,622
He had all the symptoms
of a heart attack...

1032
01:10:01,792 --> 01:10:03,690
difficulty breathing,
tightness in his chest,

1033
01:10:03,826 --> 01:10:06,519
heartbeat changes, dizziness.

1034
01:10:06,625 --> 01:10:07,852
But it wasn't a heart attack?

1035
01:10:07,959 --> 01:10:10,857
Not as far as we can tell.
His E.K.G. Looks normal.

1036
01:10:10,959 --> 01:10:11,925
What was it?

1037
01:10:12,025 --> 01:10:14,514
Well, his body's under an incredible
amount of stress, Mrs. Brewer.

1038
01:10:14,625 --> 01:10:16,056
He has high blood pressure.

1039
01:10:16,158 --> 01:10:18,056
His sinuses have led
to an ear infection.

1040
01:10:18,158 --> 01:10:20,556
He's suffering
from extreme sleep deprivation.

1041
01:10:20,692 --> 01:10:22,681
But it was not a heart attack.

1042
01:10:22,825 --> 01:10:24,621
Sometimes patients
manifest real symptoms

1043
01:10:24,725 --> 01:10:29,157
because it's easier to feel
physical pain than emotional.

1044
01:10:51,858 --> 01:10:54,086
Ryan. I wasn't expecting you.

1045
01:10:55,058 --> 01:10:57,115
Can I share?

1046
01:10:57,258 --> 01:10:58,780
My... My, uh, story.

1047
01:10:58,891 --> 01:11:01,119
My whatever... whatever it is
you people do here.

1048
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:02,951
- Yes, of course.
- Okay.

1049
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:05,284
Um, where do I start?
Where do you want me to start?

1050
01:11:05,458 --> 01:11:06,981
- You start wherever you like.
- Okay.

1051
01:11:07,092 --> 01:11:08,785
Can I say my brother's an asshole?

1052
01:11:08,891 --> 01:11:10,447
You can say whatever you want.

1053
01:11:10,558 --> 01:11:12,683
Okay. My brother
is an asshole, right?

1054
01:11:12,791 --> 01:11:15,348
And now he's some fuckin'
martyr god now that he's dead.

1055
01:11:15,491 --> 01:11:17,956
He's dead, by the way.
He's... He's dead, right?

1056
01:11:18,124 --> 01:11:20,556
Did you not get a chance
to see the body?

1057
01:11:20,724 --> 01:11:23,315
I, um...
No, I was too fucked up.

1058
01:11:23,458 --> 01:11:25,583
My mom came in to get me,
and I couldn't even move.

1059
01:11:25,691 --> 01:11:29,054
I couldn't move my head.
So I didn't get to say good-bye.

1060
01:11:29,191 --> 01:11:31,316
I just, uh, laid there in my bed

1061
01:11:31,424 --> 01:11:33,185
thinking about all the attention
he was gonna get

1062
01:11:33,291 --> 01:11:34,279
whenever he came home,

1063
01:11:34,424 --> 01:11:37,015
and how all of his stupid friends
were gonna sign his cast

1064
01:11:37,157 --> 01:11:40,385
and how he'd probably get
a pity lay out of it.

1065
01:11:40,491 --> 01:11:45,150
So, um, I didn't get to say good-bye.

1066
01:11:45,257 --> 01:11:48,950
And now... You know,
the thing was about Bennett...

1067
01:11:49,124 --> 01:11:51,283
Um...

1068
01:11:51,391 --> 01:11:55,447
The thing was, he, um...

1069
01:12:01,857 --> 01:12:03,288
He...

1070
01:12:04,523 --> 01:12:07,353
He was never an asshole.

1071
01:12:09,790 --> 01:12:13,119
He was actually really cool to me.

1072
01:12:14,723 --> 01:12:16,916
And he could have ratted me out,
like, a thousand times,

1073
01:12:17,024 --> 01:12:19,751
and he never did.

1074
01:12:19,990 --> 01:12:22,581
Me and him used to do
all kinds of fun shit together,

1075
01:12:22,723 --> 01:12:26,348
and the truth is,
I wanted to be just like him.

1076
01:12:26,490 --> 01:12:29,615
I loved him more than anything.

1077
01:12:31,923 --> 01:12:36,878
And I was too fucked up
to say good-bye.

1078
01:12:38,356 --> 01:12:40,981
And in the end,
that's all I ever gave him,

1079
01:12:41,090 --> 01:12:42,988
was nothing.

1080
01:12:43,123 --> 01:12:46,816
Do you know how that feels
to have your one shot

1081
01:12:46,956 --> 01:12:50,252
and fuckin' just blow it?

1082
01:12:50,823 --> 01:12:55,153
It's gone. I'll never get
that chance again.

1083
01:12:58,256 --> 01:13:01,245
I just miss him so much.

1084
01:13:19,622 --> 01:13:22,247
- Hey, Mrs. Brewer.
- He woke up.

1085
01:13:22,422 --> 01:13:24,547
Yesterday morning.

1086
01:13:24,722 --> 01:13:27,586
Nobody called me.
Is he all right?

1087
01:13:27,689 --> 01:13:28,882
He seems okay.

1088
01:13:28,988 --> 01:13:31,954
He's getting transferred over
to Rikers in about 10 minutes.

1089
01:13:32,055 --> 01:13:33,987
Can I talk to him?

1090
01:13:34,089 --> 01:13:36,248
Make it quick.

1091
01:13:44,888 --> 01:13:45,876
Hello.

1092
01:13:48,122 --> 01:13:50,486
I'm Grace.

1093
01:13:50,588 --> 01:13:53,054
Brewer.

1094
01:13:53,155 --> 01:13:54,984
Bennett's mother.

1095
01:13:55,089 --> 01:13:57,419
The boy in the car.

1096
01:14:00,222 --> 01:14:01,778
So?

1097
01:14:01,955 --> 01:14:04,716
So, you were the last person
to see my son alive.

1098
01:14:04,822 --> 01:14:08,255
Yeah, well, I had the green.
I'm gonna sue your whole family.

1099
01:14:08,421 --> 01:14:10,217
You remember?

1100
01:14:13,721 --> 01:14:16,380
Um...

1101
01:14:16,488 --> 01:14:17,977
Are you feeling better?

1102
01:14:18,089 --> 01:14:22,111
Does it look like
I'm feeling fuckin' better? Huh?

1103
01:14:22,221 --> 01:14:24,051
Uh... Um...

1104
01:14:25,254 --> 01:14:27,982
I saw the surveillance video,

1105
01:14:28,121 --> 01:14:30,485
and it looks like
you spoke to my son,

1106
01:14:30,588 --> 01:14:34,315
like you comforted him
after the accident?

1107
01:14:34,455 --> 01:14:36,421
I didn't comfort anybody.
Okay?

1108
01:14:36,555 --> 01:14:41,419
Now, I got some other shit
on my mind, if you didn't notice.

1109
01:14:41,521 --> 01:14:44,975
Do you remember
if he was in pain?

1110
01:14:45,088 --> 01:14:47,054
I'm not doing this, lady.

1111
01:14:47,188 --> 01:14:49,983
I have waited a very long time
to talk to you. Please.

1112
01:14:50,088 --> 01:14:51,883
- Just go. Get out.
- No, please. I can't.

1113
01:14:51,987 --> 01:14:55,215
- Get out!
- I can't.

1114
01:14:56,555 --> 01:15:00,214
He didn't die a hero or anything,
if that's what you want to hear.

1115
01:15:00,388 --> 01:15:01,910
It isn't.

1116
01:15:10,987 --> 01:15:12,646
I don't know.

1117
01:15:12,754 --> 01:15:16,652
It happened.
It happened fast.

1118
01:15:16,754 --> 01:15:19,219
He asked me if it was his fault.

1119
01:15:19,387 --> 01:15:21,353
And then you told him
that it wasn't?

1120
01:15:21,454 --> 01:15:24,784
I told him not to worry about it.

1121
01:15:24,921 --> 01:15:26,216
And what else?

1122
01:15:28,054 --> 01:15:30,110
You really want
to know this, lady?

1123
01:15:30,220 --> 01:15:32,345
More than anything.

1124
01:15:35,921 --> 01:15:41,854
His body was caught in between
the front end of my truck

1125
01:15:41,953 --> 01:15:45,113
and his door.

1126
01:15:45,253 --> 01:15:48,844
There was so much crushed metal...
I don't know.

1127
01:15:48,953 --> 01:15:53,283
Maybe it was
holding him together.

1128
01:15:53,420 --> 01:15:54,680
I didn't want to move him.

1129
01:15:54,786 --> 01:15:58,344
I don't think I could
even if I tried. Uh...

1130
01:15:59,786 --> 01:16:03,684
His right arm
was so... far behind his body,

1131
01:16:03,786 --> 01:16:07,082
it looked like
it wasn't even attached.

1132
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:11,649
I never seen anything like it.

1133
01:16:11,786 --> 01:16:14,650
And I had to climb out
over the top of my truck, uh,

1134
01:16:14,753 --> 01:16:16,742
just to get to him.

1135
01:16:18,786 --> 01:16:20,376
I don't think he was in pain.

1136
01:16:20,486 --> 01:16:24,350
I just, uh, think he was cold.

1137
01:16:24,453 --> 01:16:26,646
And then you gave him your jacket?

1138
01:16:26,786 --> 01:16:29,343
Yeah, but it didn't make it
any better.

1139
01:16:29,519 --> 01:16:30,985
It was, um...

1140
01:16:31,087 --> 01:16:34,541
The... blood...

1141
01:16:34,653 --> 01:16:36,846
The blood was making him cold.

1142
01:16:37,419 --> 01:16:38,908
How much blood?

1143
01:16:41,886 --> 01:16:43,545
How much?

1144
01:16:43,653 --> 01:16:48,517
More than, uh, I've ever seen.

1145
01:16:51,286 --> 01:16:52,774
Was he scared?

1146
01:16:55,119 --> 01:16:56,778
Uh, I don't know.

1147
01:16:56,885 --> 01:17:01,545
I mean, there was, uh...
fluid everywhere, but...

1148
01:17:01,718 --> 01:17:03,707
A bunch of stuff coming out
of him, you know?

1149
01:17:05,019 --> 01:17:06,746
Uh...

1150
01:17:06,885 --> 01:17:10,045
He might have been crying,
I guess. I don't know.

1151
01:17:10,152 --> 01:17:12,811
Was he crying
because he was in pain,

1152
01:17:12,952 --> 01:17:15,474
or was he crying
because he was scared?

1153
01:17:15,618 --> 01:17:18,244
- What's the difference?
- Which one was it?

1154
01:17:18,418 --> 01:17:20,577
Scared, I guess.

1155
01:17:23,919 --> 01:17:27,113
Do you think
he knew he was dying?

1156
01:17:27,251 --> 01:17:29,979
Did he know he was dying?

1157
01:17:30,086 --> 01:17:32,711
He knew it was bad,

1158
01:17:32,852 --> 01:17:35,613
but it's not like we were talking
about God or anything.

1159
01:17:35,752 --> 01:17:38,877
I just told him,
"You listen for those sirens.

1160
01:17:40,051 --> 01:17:43,040
Once you hear the siren,
everything will be all right. "

1161
01:17:43,218 --> 01:17:46,378
Oh, God.

1162
01:17:46,518 --> 01:17:48,381
He needed me,
and I wasn't there.

1163
01:17:48,518 --> 01:17:51,972
I should have been there
to make sure that he wasn't afraid

1164
01:17:52,118 --> 01:17:55,516
and tell him that I loved him
and hold him and...

1165
01:17:55,618 --> 01:17:56,606
Hey, hey, hey.

1166
01:17:58,118 --> 01:18:00,243
Hey.

1167
01:18:00,418 --> 01:18:04,441
Hey, hey, uh, you want some,
uh, water or something?

1168
01:18:04,585 --> 01:18:06,982
He needed me,
and he called out for me,

1169
01:18:07,085 --> 01:18:08,449
and I wasn't even there.

1170
01:18:09,485 --> 01:18:11,178
Oh, he didn't call for you.

1171
01:18:11,351 --> 01:18:13,578
He called out for her
over and over again.

1172
01:18:13,717 --> 01:18:16,547
That, uh, girl in his car.

1173
01:18:18,651 --> 01:18:20,083
Rose?

1174
01:18:20,251 --> 01:18:22,217
Rose. All he cared about
was Rose...

1175
01:18:22,318 --> 01:18:24,442
if she was hurt,
if she was in pain,

1176
01:18:24,551 --> 01:18:26,346
if she was asking for him.

1177
01:18:26,484 --> 01:18:27,882
He kept telling me
over and over again,

1178
01:18:27,984 --> 01:18:30,007
"You've got to help her.
You should be taking care of her. "

1179
01:18:30,118 --> 01:18:34,277
But, uh, I thought she was dead.

1180
01:18:34,451 --> 01:18:35,678
He asked for Rose.

1181
01:18:35,784 --> 01:18:38,272
He even asked me
to turn up the radio.

1182
01:18:38,384 --> 01:18:41,010
This poor kid, he's got blood
coming out of his ears.

1183
01:18:41,184 --> 01:18:43,776
He wanted her to hear
this song that was playing.

1184
01:18:43,884 --> 01:18:48,543
He thought she might like to hear it.

1185
01:18:48,651 --> 01:18:51,617
I have to go.

1186
01:19:02,250 --> 01:19:06,182
Relax. You can stay here
as long as you want.

1187
01:19:06,350 --> 01:19:10,873
And, Rose, I've called my mom
from women's correctional facilities.

1188
01:19:10,983 --> 01:19:14,006
This is, like, tiny, I swear.

1189
01:19:18,650 --> 01:19:21,173
Hi. Lydia?

1190
01:19:21,317 --> 01:19:23,010
Yeah. Hi.
Uh, this is Shea.

1191
01:19:23,117 --> 01:19:24,707
I'm Rose's friend from work.

1192
01:19:24,817 --> 01:19:26,181
Tell her I'm okay.

1193
01:19:26,350 --> 01:19:27,576
Rose is absolutely fine,

1194
01:19:27,683 --> 01:19:31,706
and, um, she actually wants me
to tell you something which...

1195
01:19:31,817 --> 01:19:34,647
Okay. Well, we're not gonna need
a lot of your time, so...

1196
01:19:35,683 --> 01:19:37,581
Oh, I... I didn't know.

1197
01:19:38,750 --> 01:19:40,773
Um, she lost her job?

1198
01:19:40,950 --> 01:19:42,506
Ah.

1199
01:19:42,650 --> 01:19:45,673
And she only has 15 minutes left
on the phone.

1200
01:19:46,917 --> 01:19:49,610
Um, I'm really sorry
to hear about all that,

1201
01:19:49,716 --> 01:19:53,113
but, uh, Rose wants me
to tell you something,

1202
01:19:53,283 --> 01:19:56,044
which is that she is pregnant.

1203
01:19:57,650 --> 01:20:02,946
Yay! Um, I'd say just like
three or four months.

1204
01:20:03,116 --> 01:20:04,639
Yeah.
Oh, she's keeping it.

1205
01:20:04,750 --> 01:20:08,045
She put off Barnard for a year,
and, um...

1206
01:20:08,149 --> 01:20:11,377
Yeah. She's just, like,
handling it like a total Republican.

1207
01:20:11,550 --> 01:20:15,573
And, um, she wants you to know
that she is not at all scared.

1208
01:20:15,749 --> 01:20:19,238
And, uh, she's getting support
from the father's family and...

1209
01:20:19,349 --> 01:20:21,406
Um, I don't know.

1210
01:20:21,549 --> 01:20:24,777
I guess just whatever she needs.

1211
01:20:24,882 --> 01:20:25,745
Okay.

1212
01:20:25,916 --> 01:20:27,905
Um, she wants me
to ask you something.

1213
01:20:30,216 --> 01:20:34,080
Tell her it's okay
if she wants to come here.

1214
01:20:34,183 --> 01:20:35,739
Tell her it's fine.

1215
01:20:35,849 --> 01:20:38,077
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1216
01:20:39,248 --> 01:20:40,680
Uh...

1217
01:20:44,248 --> 01:20:46,180
What?

1218
01:20:47,016 --> 01:20:51,175
Um, she wants you to ask
for 10,000 up front.

1219
01:20:51,315 --> 01:20:54,475
She says that she'll come help you
if you can get the 10,000 now,

1220
01:20:54,582 --> 01:20:58,412
'cause, um, well, she thinks
it's what you'll need.

1221
01:21:06,682 --> 01:21:11,841
She seemed, like, really glad
to hear that you were doing okay.

1222
01:21:11,948 --> 01:21:13,811
That's fine.

1223
01:21:45,414 --> 01:21:48,006
Doctor said you could go?

1224
01:21:48,148 --> 01:21:49,807
Yeah.

1225
01:21:49,915 --> 01:21:51,346
Good.

1226
01:21:54,347 --> 01:21:56,540
You talked with Jordan Walker,
didn't you?

1227
01:22:00,281 --> 01:22:01,178
Yes.

1228
01:22:02,947 --> 01:22:04,675
What did you learn?

1229
01:22:12,781 --> 01:22:14,406
Bennett loved her, didn't he?

1230
01:22:23,448 --> 01:22:26,880
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

1231
01:22:29,547 --> 01:22:31,604
I wanted him to call for me.

1232
01:22:31,747 --> 01:22:33,975
Is that such a terrible thing?

1233
01:22:34,081 --> 01:22:37,535
I call for you.

1234
01:22:38,413 --> 01:22:42,278
I call for you every day.

1235
01:22:43,580 --> 01:22:46,274
I'm here now.

1236
01:22:46,380 --> 01:22:49,244
Oh, my God.

1237
01:22:49,413 --> 01:22:50,242
Poor baby.

1238
01:22:50,346 --> 01:22:54,540
- Oh, my God, my poor boy.
- It's okay. It's okay.

1239
01:22:54,647 --> 01:22:57,011
Oh, my poor, poor, poor,
poor boy.

1240
01:22:57,146 --> 01:22:59,010
Okay. It's all right.

1241
01:22:59,146 --> 01:23:00,373
It's okay.

1242
01:23:01,814 --> 01:23:03,643
Yes, it's okay.
All right.

1243
01:23:05,146 --> 01:23:07,305
Yes. It's all right.

1244
01:23:09,613 --> 01:23:13,477
I know. I know.
I know. I know.

1245
01:23:13,580 --> 01:23:15,739
It's okay. It's okay.
That's it.

1246
01:23:15,846 --> 01:23:17,971
I wasn't there
when he needed me the most.

1247
01:23:18,113 --> 01:23:20,739
Had I... I could... I could...
I could have saved him.

1248
01:23:20,879 --> 01:23:24,073
I could have saved him.
I could have saved him.

1249
01:23:24,213 --> 01:23:24,974
Allen...

1250
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:27,978
I had 17 minutes,
and I could have saved him, Grace.

1251
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:29,773
No. Listen to me.
Look at me. Allen.

1252
01:23:29,879 --> 01:23:31,505
Honey, you couldn't.
Listen to me.

1253
01:23:31,612 --> 01:23:34,238
It was a mistake.
It was a mistake.

1254
01:23:34,413 --> 01:23:36,379
He died on impact.
He didn't suffer at all.

1255
01:23:36,512 --> 01:23:38,376
You couldn't have done anything.

1256
01:23:38,512 --> 01:23:40,637
He didn't suffer.
There was no suffering.

1257
01:23:40,779 --> 01:23:44,575
There was nothing
you could have done to help him.

1258
01:23:44,679 --> 01:23:46,770
- Really.
- Oh, Grace.

1259
01:23:47,679 --> 01:23:49,645
Oh, Grace.

1260
01:23:49,746 --> 01:23:51,974
It's okay.

1261
01:23:52,779 --> 01:23:54,836
Oh.

1262
01:23:55,979 --> 01:23:57,535
It's okay.

1263
01:23:59,312 --> 01:24:04,007
Grace, we have to bring her home.

1264
01:24:04,112 --> 01:24:07,510
- We have to.
- Okay.

1265
01:24:32,279 --> 01:24:34,870
All the places
she could have gone.

1266
01:24:35,012 --> 01:24:36,478
I'm gonna go look for her.

1267
01:24:36,578 --> 01:24:38,908
We'll go with you.
Okay?

1268
01:24:39,012 --> 01:24:40,342
I'm ready. I'm okay.

1269
01:24:40,446 --> 01:24:42,707
Come on. Let's go.

1270
01:24:43,412 --> 01:24:44,139
Good work.

1271
01:24:44,245 --> 01:24:46,268
After you.
No, don't...

1272
01:24:57,012 --> 01:24:58,910
Shea.

1273
01:25:00,578 --> 01:25:02,544
Hi. It's Allen Brewer here.

1274
01:25:02,645 --> 01:25:05,577
Wow. You really would be
caught dead dressed like that.

1275
01:25:05,745 --> 01:25:08,404
- I'm looking for Rose.
- You lost her?

1276
01:25:09,745 --> 01:25:11,802
- In a way.
- I don't know where she is.

1277
01:25:11,912 --> 01:25:14,503
I'd like very much to find her.
We're very worried.

1278
01:25:14,611 --> 01:25:17,475
So, please, if you can
tell us something, at least...

1279
01:25:17,611 --> 01:25:19,839
It's about time.

1280
01:25:23,611 --> 01:25:24,372
All right.

1281
01:25:24,478 --> 01:25:26,671
Try the place
where they crashed.

1282
01:25:26,844 --> 01:25:28,401
She goes there in the afternoons.

1283
01:25:32,944 --> 01:25:34,570
Okay.

1284
01:26:03,078 --> 01:26:05,135
Rose!

1285
01:26:08,243 --> 01:26:10,209
- Rose! Wait!
Rose!

1286
01:26:10,310 --> 01:26:11,708
Rose!
Rose!

1287
01:26:19,944 --> 01:26:21,966
Don't worry, the baby is fine!

1288
01:26:22,110 --> 01:26:24,099
Rose, we were worried, okay?

1289
01:26:24,210 --> 01:26:25,869
Why? Why would you be
worried about me?

1290
01:26:26,043 --> 01:26:29,703
Because I'm reading old yearbooks
to try to learn about my baby's dad?

1291
01:26:29,876 --> 01:26:32,865
Where you going, huh?
Hey, look, you're gonna miss her.

1292
01:26:34,177 --> 01:26:35,938
Because the most disgusting stuff
I've ever seen

1293
01:26:36,077 --> 01:26:37,441
just came out of my body
on a bus?

1294
01:26:37,610 --> 01:26:39,473
Did your water break?
Are you in labor?

1295
01:26:39,610 --> 01:26:40,541
I'm fine!

1296
01:26:40,709 --> 01:26:45,108
Really wonderful progress, Rose.
A beautiful way to end the year.

1297
01:26:45,277 --> 01:26:47,334
We were concerned about you.
You just disappeared.

1298
01:26:47,510 --> 01:26:51,703
Don't worry. I can do anything,
and this baby will be okay.

1299
01:26:51,810 --> 01:26:53,106
Bennett!

1300
01:26:54,077 --> 01:26:56,508
Let us take you to the hospital,
and if it's too soon,

1301
01:26:56,609 --> 01:26:58,666
then we'll just, uh...
we'll take you home.

1302
01:27:01,810 --> 01:27:03,298
I don't want to go home.

1303
01:27:03,409 --> 01:27:06,171
I don't want my baby to grow up
in your messed-up home.

1304
01:27:06,276 --> 01:27:07,242
Am I supposed to raise her

1305
01:27:07,342 --> 01:27:09,036
without ever talking
about her father?

1306
01:27:09,143 --> 01:27:11,472
Tell her she can't even mention
his name in front of her grandfather

1307
01:27:11,576 --> 01:27:14,701
because he hasn't completely
acknowledged that he's dead?

1308
01:27:14,876 --> 01:27:16,899
Or worry at night
that her grandmother

1309
01:27:17,076 --> 01:27:18,269
is gonna smother her
in her sleep

1310
01:27:18,376 --> 01:27:20,433
because she'd rather
she didn't exist?

1311
01:27:20,543 --> 01:27:23,907
Or that her uncle will leave
urine samples next to her crib?

1312
01:27:25,376 --> 01:27:27,899
I'm sorry. That wasn't fair.
I like you, Ryan.

1313
01:27:29,476 --> 01:27:30,907
I like you, too.

1314
01:27:31,076 --> 01:27:32,542
Thank you.

1315
01:27:33,609 --> 01:27:37,041
Look, I promise I won't
smother her in her crib.

1316
01:27:37,209 --> 01:27:42,403
I know I wasn't very helpful to you
in your situation,

1317
01:27:42,576 --> 01:27:46,372
and if I had to do it again,
I would do it completely differently.

1318
01:27:48,608 --> 01:27:51,006
Rose.

1319
01:27:51,109 --> 01:27:52,904
Look.

1320
01:27:54,608 --> 01:27:57,574
Once you have this baby,
you'll understand

1321
01:27:57,675 --> 01:28:00,233
that the most horrible thing
that can happen to a mother

1322
01:28:00,342 --> 01:28:01,807
is to lose her child.

1323
01:28:08,375 --> 01:28:10,398
I'm sorry...

1324
01:28:11,809 --> 01:28:15,673
for what happened between us.

1325
01:28:15,775 --> 01:28:17,866
I really am.

1326
01:28:19,208 --> 01:28:21,367
Please, Rose.

1327
01:28:21,542 --> 01:28:26,031
Give us a chance here.
Just... Just get in the car with us.

1328
01:28:27,075 --> 01:28:28,905
Please.

1329
01:28:36,542 --> 01:28:38,837
I don't even know who he is.

1330
01:28:39,974 --> 01:28:41,997
What do you want to know?
We'll tell you.

1331
01:28:42,175 --> 01:28:45,539
I want to know everything
I would know if he was still alive.

1332
01:28:45,675 --> 01:28:47,664
I want more memories of him.

1333
01:28:49,808 --> 01:28:50,967
Yeah.

1334
01:28:51,075 --> 01:28:53,268
We'll tell you everything
you want to know about him.

1335
01:28:53,375 --> 01:28:55,840
We'll just keep talking
till the baby comes.

1336
01:28:59,475 --> 01:29:02,066
There's a picture of Bennett
on the track.

1337
01:29:02,908 --> 01:29:06,033
Was he fast?
Is my baby gonna be fast?

1338
01:29:06,208 --> 01:29:07,696
Yes.

1339
01:29:07,874 --> 01:29:09,272
How fast?

1340
01:29:10,407 --> 01:29:13,532
50-second 400-meter fast.

1341
01:29:14,574 --> 01:29:16,437
Wow.

1342
01:29:26,008 --> 01:29:29,462
Okay. Okay.

1343
01:29:30,507 --> 01:29:32,496
He was voted Best All-Around.

1344
01:29:32,607 --> 01:29:34,869
Why did they...
Why did people like him so much?

1345
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:38,233
Tell me!

1346
01:29:38,407 --> 01:29:41,168
Uh, because he was a nice guy.

1347
01:29:41,274 --> 01:29:44,502
In third grade
when his friend Jack got glasses,

1348
01:29:44,674 --> 01:29:47,572
Bennett felt so bad for him that
he took Allen's reading glasses...

1349
01:29:47,740 --> 01:29:48,831
- You remember?
- Mm-hmm.

1350
01:29:48,940 --> 01:29:50,167
And he wore them to school
the next day

1351
01:29:50,274 --> 01:29:51,570
so Jack wouldn't be the only one.

1352
01:29:51,740 --> 01:29:54,002
Okay. Okay.

1353
01:29:54,107 --> 01:29:56,369
Um, who's this girl he's with?

1354
01:29:56,474 --> 01:29:57,769
That is his prom date,

1355
01:29:57,873 --> 01:29:59,896
and he only went with her
because she gave good head.

1356
01:30:00,007 --> 01:30:01,268
- Ryan!
- That's true!

1357
01:30:01,374 --> 01:30:03,431
No, that's good. I like that.
That's information.

1358
01:30:03,540 --> 01:30:04,870
I think she was a very smart girl.

1359
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:08,165
They studied English lit together
one summer at Oxford.

1360
01:30:08,274 --> 01:30:09,705
- She gave good head.
- What else?

1361
01:30:09,873 --> 01:30:10,964
- Ryan!
- It's true. It's true.

1362
01:30:11,074 --> 01:30:13,006
What else? What else?
What else? What else?

1363
01:30:13,107 --> 01:30:14,595
He hated to have his picture taken.

1364
01:30:14,773 --> 01:30:17,568
Whenever I went to take his picture,
he'd always make this horrible face.

1365
01:30:17,673 --> 01:30:19,298
- What was the face?
- Oh, it was a...

1366
01:30:19,406 --> 01:30:21,304
Show me the face!

1367
01:30:21,406 --> 01:30:23,838
That's terrible.

1368
01:30:24,007 --> 01:30:26,165
He'd eat anything off his plate
as long as it was separated.

1369
01:30:26,273 --> 01:30:26,898
That's true.

1370
01:30:27,007 --> 01:30:28,597
He'd take all the toppings
off his pizza

1371
01:30:28,706 --> 01:30:29,729
and he'd eat 'em in order.

1372
01:30:29,873 --> 01:30:31,270
It was really...
It was really weird.

1373
01:30:31,373 --> 01:30:34,168
Well, he was a little O.C.D.,
but in a very sweet way, right?

1374
01:30:34,273 --> 01:30:35,296
Mm-hmm.
Very sweet.

1375
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:37,406
When he used to eat Cheerios,
he'd eat them in pairs

1376
01:30:37,506 --> 01:30:39,529
because he didn't want them
to be alone in his tummy.

1377
01:30:39,640 --> 01:30:40,537
Ah, God, this hurts!

1378
01:30:40,673 --> 01:30:42,298
I used to give him shit
for that all the time.

1379
01:30:42,406 --> 01:30:44,338
And he never flossed.

1380
01:30:44,440 --> 01:30:46,269
But he did wear an enormous
amount of cologne

1381
01:30:46,373 --> 01:30:47,361
once he discovered it,

1382
01:30:47,540 --> 01:30:49,369
and his room smelled
like a men's magazine.

1383
01:30:49,540 --> 01:30:52,165
Ow!

1384
01:30:52,273 --> 01:30:54,034
Oh! It's happening.

1385
01:30:54,139 --> 01:30:55,264
Yes, sweetie, it is.

1386
01:30:57,672 --> 01:30:59,298
I know, sweetie.
It's all right. It's all right.

1387
01:30:59,406 --> 01:31:01,997
Bennett lived for 18 years,
3 months, 7 days,

1388
01:31:02,106 --> 01:31:04,867
2 hours, 36 minutes.

1389
01:31:04,972 --> 01:31:09,098
He broke 6 bones in his lifetime
and had a 3.97 G.P.A.

1390
01:31:09,239 --> 01:31:11,568
He never had a girlfriend
before he met you.

1391
01:31:13,739 --> 01:31:17,831
His highest temperature was 104.3.

1392
01:31:17,972 --> 01:31:23,234
And uh, he knew how to count
before he said his first word.

1393
01:31:23,405 --> 01:31:24,735
Which was?

1394
01:31:26,139 --> 01:31:27,661
- Wow.
- Wow.

1395
01:31:29,806 --> 01:31:30,863
Thank you.

1396
01:31:30,972 --> 01:31:32,870
Of course.

1397
01:31:35,539 --> 01:31:37,596
Thank you.

1398
01:31:38,939 --> 01:31:41,995
You're doing great.
Just keep breathing.

1399
01:31:42,172 --> 01:31:44,229
That's it, sweetheart. Okay.
Squeeze my hand if you have to.

1400
01:31:45,739 --> 01:31:48,534
You're doing great. That's it.
Just keep breathing. That's it.

1401
01:31:48,705 --> 01:31:50,398
# Cryin' into your sleeves #

1402
01:31:50,505 --> 01:31:52,437
That's it.
We're gonna be there soon.

1403
01:31:52,539 --> 01:31:54,232
That's a girl.
You're doing great.

1404
01:31:54,338 --> 01:31:56,099
# 'Cause you miss
those lovin' arms #

1405
01:31:56,205 --> 01:31:59,103
It won't be long. That's a girl.
That's it. That's it.

1406
01:31:59,205 --> 01:32:02,330
# A lullaby keeps on playin' #

1407
01:32:03,771 --> 01:32:07,828
# You're thinkin' it's a dream #

1408
01:32:07,938 --> 01:32:12,268
# 'Cause you miss
those lovin' arms #

1409
01:32:12,439 --> 01:32:13,904
Oh, my God.

1410
01:32:17,738 --> 01:32:20,000
Her name is Ruby.

1411
01:32:22,538 --> 01:32:27,164
# And you've got a good mind
to pray #

1412
01:32:29,471 --> 01:32:32,665
# They say it's all part of his plan #

1413
01:32:32,771 --> 01:32:37,499
# But what if he's got
slippery hands? #

1414
01:32:41,304 --> 01:32:45,566
# Well, it's a sad face
you're wearin' #

1415
01:32:45,671 --> 01:32:48,569
# Like a burned-out sun #

1416
01:32:50,404 --> 01:32:55,268
# 'Cause you miss
those lovin' arms #

1417
01:32:58,738 --> 01:33:02,170
# You'd think a grown man
would care #

1418
01:33:02,337 --> 01:33:06,666
# About his bootlace undone #

1419
01:33:06,837 --> 01:33:12,065
# But you just miss
those lovin' arms #

1420
01:33:12,804 --> 01:33:19,464
# Yeah, you miss
those lovin' arms #

1421
01:33:21,737 --> 01:33:26,601
# And you got a good mind to pray #

1422
01:33:28,503 --> 01:33:31,867
# They say it's all part of his plan #

1423
01:33:31,970 --> 01:33:37,527
# But what if he's got
slippery hands? #

1424
01:33:37,703 --> 01:33:40,726
# Well, goddamn #

1425
01:33:40,904 --> 01:33:44,597
# You're a boy, not a man #

1426
01:33:45,770 --> 01:33:50,725
# When you miss those lovin' arms #

1427
01:33:56,804 --> 01:33:57,667
Hey.

1428
01:34:01,936 --> 01:34:03,368
Hi.

1429
01:34:04,370 --> 01:34:06,063
Hi.

1430
01:34:36,236 --> 01:34:39,497
# Everybody wants to know you #

1431
01:34:39,602 --> 01:34:42,727
# They float all around your head #

1432
01:34:42,836 --> 01:34:46,268
# Like a mobile #

1433
01:34:46,369 --> 01:34:50,096
# Hell, you don't know
what they're sayin' #

1434
01:34:50,202 --> 01:34:53,293
# Oh, but can't you tell #

1435
01:34:53,402 --> 01:34:56,493
# You're a golden egg #

1436
01:34:56,602 --> 01:35:01,898
# Of all the ways
I said your name #

1437
01:35:02,002 --> 01:35:06,662
# A hundred times,
but now it's changed #

1438
01:35:06,769 --> 01:35:11,394
# And little things
I didn't have #

1439
01:35:11,602 --> 01:35:14,193
# Are going off #

1440
01:35:14,335 --> 01:35:17,495
# Like bottle caps #

1441
01:35:17,602 --> 01:35:21,931
# A light,
catch a reflection #

1442
01:35:22,035 --> 01:35:27,058
# A cold night,
want some attention #

1443
01:35:27,269 --> 01:35:31,201
# I give without thinking #

1444
01:35:31,302 --> 01:35:34,597
# That's the way it is now #

1445
01:35:38,968 --> 01:35:43,627
# Soft spots,
our hearts made for breaking #

1446
01:35:43,735 --> 01:35:48,100
# Tie knots,
show me what you're making #

1447
01:35:48,201 --> 01:35:52,190
# We fight for a reason #

1448
01:35:52,401 --> 01:35:56,595
# Now it's off to bed #

1449
01:36:10,501 --> 01:36:15,899
# If I could help you
as much as I wanted to #

1450
01:36:20,967 --> 01:36:24,331
# But, hell, you don't know
what I'm sayin' #

1451
01:36:24,535 --> 01:36:27,433
# Oh, but can't you tell #

1452
01:36:27,634 --> 01:36:30,725
# I love you #

1453
01:36:30,934 --> 01:36:36,026
# Of all the ways
I said your name #

1454
01:36:36,134 --> 01:36:41,066
# A hundred times,
but now it's changed #

1455

1457
01:36:48,700 --> 01:36:52,064
# Like bottle caps #

1458
01:36:52,267 --> 01:36:57,427
# Going off like bottle caps #

1459
01:36:57,534 --> 01:37:02,023
# A light,
send a reflection #

1460
01:37:02,133 --> 01:37:07,122

want some attention #

1461
01:37:07,233 --> 01:37:11,097

our hearts made for breaking #

1464

# Tie knots,
show me what you're making #
