1
00:00:19,888 --> 00:00:21,910
My last ones

2
00:00:26,179 --> 00:00:28,199
Yeti!
Where are you?

3
00:00:28,256 --> 00:00:33,711
I need you!
Yeti! Come now, quick!

4
00:00:45,562 --> 00:00:47,583
Appearable snowman?

5
00:00:47,713 --> 00:00:50,338
The Tibetan called them Yeti.

6
00:00:59,841 --> 00:01:01,860
She speaks Yeti?

7
00:01:27,949 --> 00:01:31,036
Why do I always have to save the day?

8
00:01:37,073 --> 00:01:39,093
Get the other guy!

9
00:02:47,773 --> 00:02:49,796
You can die slow or you can die fast?

10
00:03:16,501 --> 00:03:19,330
Ya! I did it!

11
00:03:19,455 --> 00:03:21,475
Oh, man.
I did it.

12
00:03:22,184 --> 00:03:24,537
Time to retreat I think.

13
00:03:29,327 --> 00:03:30,649
I'm in your team.

14
00:03:30,699 --> 00:03:34,433
I'm a team player!
One for all, all for me, kind of thing?

15
00:03:35,033 --> 00:03:37,764
The dynamite, always dynamite!
We should

16
00:03:38,016 --> 00:03:39,733
get out of here..

17
00:03:54,576 --> 00:03:57,506
Wow, back off!
Back of!

18
00:04:27,254 --> 00:04:31,142
I hate mummies!
They never play fair.

19
00:04:38,281 --> 00:04:41,308
Dad!
What are you doing?

20
00:04:48,434 --> 00:04:52,172
Over here!
Over here, come on!

21
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,242
Shangri-La!!!

22
00:05:40,481 --> 00:05:42,501
That's a diamond.

23
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,902
I can use a diamond like that.

24
00:06:09,493 --> 00:06:10,702
Dad!

25
00:06:33,573 --> 00:06:35,594
Avalanche!

26
00:07:08,098 --> 00:07:10,116
Help!
Help me!

27
00:07:15,288 --> 00:07:17,310
Please, help me!

28
00:08:01,719 --> 00:08:04,751
I'm fine, and I'm still alive.

29
00:08:08,046 --> 00:08:10,367
Help me please, somebody help me?

30
00:08:11,603 --> 00:08:13,117
We're here!

31
00:08:14,563 --> 00:08:16,784
Mom, we're down here!

32
00:08:31,395 --> 00:08:32,909
Oh my god.

33
00:08:34,008 --> 00:08:38,049
We've got to take them to Shangri-La.
Now it's an only chance.

34
00:08:57,842 --> 00:08:59,457
We've made it!

35
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:17,855
The pool!

36
00:10:28,344 --> 00:10:29,656
Thank you.

37
00:10:30,979 --> 00:10:35,019
You must rest.
We'll take you into my chamber.

38
00:11:02,649 --> 00:11:06,385
Well it's not everyone that gets the brother all from the death.

39
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:16,924
Is this Shangri-La?

40
00:11:26,762 --> 00:11:30,804
I can live here.
Lots of opportunity

41
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:33,831
A casino.

42
00:11:56,152 --> 00:11:59,181
Now rest them all. Thank you.

43
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:02,912
How can you get involved in all of this?

44
00:12:02,994 --> 00:12:06,631
The emperor murdered the only man I've ever loved.

45
00:12:07,424 --> 00:12:09,140
Lin's father.

46
00:12:09,474 --> 00:12:11,496
I would have died too by his hand...

47
00:12:12,725 --> 00:12:16,765
...if the Yeti had not found me and brought me to this pool.

48
00:12:17,912 --> 00:12:21,851
How old is this happened?
Is is before the Christ?

49
00:12:24,598 --> 00:12:26,919
How long you've got in this tomb?

50
00:12:27,837 --> 00:12:29,856
Over two thousand years.

51
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,043
The emperor must never be allowed to reach the pool.

52
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:40,180
Or he will have the power to raise his army.

53
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:46,865
Once he becomes immortal, he can transform himself
into the most hedious creature ever seen.

54
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,181
I will check the first watch at the entrance.

55
00:12:58,517 --> 00:13:01,850
I have no problem dating an older woman.

56
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:05,786
I'm afraid we can't be together.

57
00:13:08,671 --> 00:13:09,884
Why?

58
00:13:10,747 --> 00:13:12,870
Because I'm gonna live forever.

59
00:13:14,256 --> 00:13:16,276
I don't want to watch you die.

60
00:13:17,806 --> 00:13:19,524
So what? That's it?

61
00:13:20,413 --> 00:13:22,431
You just gonna see the sideline for eternity.

62
00:13:23,434 --> 00:13:27,170
My mother has mourned of my father for the centuries.

63
00:13:27,293 --> 00:13:29,515
I don't know if my heart can bear it.

64
00:13:34,809 --> 00:13:37,032
People can live in entire lifetime if one want.

65
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:42,233
I want my parents to live everyday.

66
00:13:48,515 --> 00:13:51,341
Alex, your father is awake.
In up here.

67
00:14:08,163 --> 00:14:11,194
If this is heaven, it is pretty good so far.

68
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:23,615
Nice to see something has never changed.

69
00:14:40,497 --> 00:14:42,520
Go easy on him, he feels terrible.

70
00:14:48,906 --> 00:14:50,926
I saw you laying there, Dad.

71
00:14:52,938 --> 00:14:54,959
I've never been so scared in my life.

72
00:14:56,484 --> 00:14:58,501
Well, I'm get used two of us.

73
00:15:01,229 --> 00:15:04,662
You supposed to die.
You know you're Ricochet O'Connell, right?

74
00:15:04,772 --> 00:15:08,814
You beat up us around but you still stand in the end.

75
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:13,143
I really never thought a world without you.

76
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,773
The truth is

77
00:15:25,442 --> 00:15:26,957
I am just trying ...

78
00:15:29,507 --> 00:15:31,224
I am just ...

79
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,628
I am trying to be a good husband and I am trying to be a good parent

80
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:37,343
and the truth is I've been dropped the both.

81
00:15:39,162 --> 00:15:41,181
I've been a world greatest's son.

82
00:15:41,721 --> 00:15:44,047
I know it's good cause I  rise a family.

83
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:46,407
Come here.

84
00:15:50,252 --> 00:15:51,563
My boys.

85
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:31,861
Oh, no.
His power has been fully restored.

86
00:16:31,912 --> 00:16:33,629
Time to go.

87
00:17:11,814 --> 00:17:13,834
He is immortal.

88
00:17:42,408 --> 00:17:45,823
Hey you three any shape something son of a bitch.

89
00:18:23,938 --> 00:18:26,184
He is taking her back to his tomb ro raise his army.

90
00:18:26,234 --> 00:18:29,819
- Is there any faster way down from here?
- The Yeti. No help.

91
00:18:29,871 --> 00:18:31,857
But he's already on the air.
It will be too late.

92
00:18:31,907 --> 00:18:35,645
Mad Dog have quite three headed lizards anyday in the week.
Let's go

93
00:18:41,674 --> 00:18:43,694
Foreside, at nine o'clock.

94
00:18:52,135 --> 00:18:54,236
Should I quit drinking?

95
00:18:58,964 --> 00:19:02,803
Jonathan to Rick.
You've better get move on if you gonna be to the tomb.

96
00:19:03,061 --> 00:19:06,090
Just back here as fast you can reinforcement, not sight seeing.

97
00:19:09,779 --> 00:19:10,787
Here, Dad.

98
00:19:11,561 --> 00:19:13,581
Lent me?
Nice.

99
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:18,004
The terracotta army is not indestructible until  they cross the great wall.

100
00:19:18,784 --> 00:19:21,812
How it exactly we supposed send them of?

101
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:27,457
When the emperor build the wall he buried his enemies
underneath then curses souls to hold it up eternity.

102
00:19:27,507 --> 00:19:29,832
Most of them the conquered soldiers.

103
00:19:30,087 --> 00:19:32,409
I will call them to battle once again.

104
00:19:32,641 --> 00:19:37,389
My mark on altar, rise an army,  that sounds like a plan.

105
00:19:37,721 --> 00:19:39,033
Let's go.

106
00:20:15,568 --> 00:20:18,660
- Alex. Where he go?
- Where do you think?

107
00:22:20,489 --> 00:22:25,925
Open the gate of the past and free the souls of the wrong who he's damned.

108
00:22:34,424 --> 00:22:41,067
In the name of the ancesters and rightious,
I sacrifice my immortality and that's of my daughter

109
00:22:41,118 --> 00:22:43,139
so that you may rise this day.

110
00:22:55,441 --> 00:23:01,340
Bring down the rough of the oppressed on his emperor and all who follow him.

111
00:23:11,204 --> 00:23:14,233
I call of the hundreds, and the thousands,

112
00:23:14,234 --> 00:23:17,234
that you may rise up and seize this moment

113
00:23:18,145 --> 00:23:19,704
to take your victory

114
00:23:19,754 --> 00:23:21,488
to take your justice.

115
00:23:21,537 --> 00:23:23,559
And to take your revenge!

116
00:24:11,553 --> 00:24:12,763
These  are

117
00:24:12,865 --> 00:24:14,887
your good dead guys, right?

118
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:21,451
Zi Yuan sent us.

119
00:24:21,515 --> 00:24:23,105
Do we speak English?

120
00:24:23,156 --> 00:24:24,820
We're with Zi Yuan.

121
00:25:07,007 --> 00:25:08,825
It's coming.

122
00:25:59,463 --> 00:26:01,484
Welcome in twentieth century.

123
00:28:41,225 --> 00:28:43,648
I really hate mummies.

124
00:28:52,656 --> 00:28:53,865
Run!

125
00:29:40,761 --> 00:29:44,096
Die you mummy bastard!
Die!

126
00:29:44,243 --> 00:29:47,071
There's no call for the bad language.

127
00:30:19,684 --> 00:30:21,401
Have you regret, darling?

128
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:25,810
None, not ever.

129
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,915
- You OK?
- Yeah, sure.

130
00:30:37,221 --> 00:30:38,462
No problem

131
00:30:38,514 --> 00:30:40,534
We had completely under control.

132
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:45,903
This guy ever won a trick?

133
00:30:59,403 --> 00:31:01,726
Mother!
No!

134
00:31:03,915 --> 00:31:05,126
Mother.

135
00:31:22,728 --> 00:31:26,150
Hit this through his heart

136
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:30,751
You must still live.

137
00:31:31,587 --> 00:31:32,797
My daughter.

138
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:53,805
She said, through the heart

139
00:31:54,525 --> 00:31:56,037
Through the heart.

140
00:35:15,651 --> 00:35:18,681
Enough tricks!
Where is your honor?

141
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:23,462
Fight like a man.

142
00:36:02,791 --> 00:36:04,104
Devide...

143
00:36:06,076 --> 00:36:07,288
and conquere.

144
00:36:54,751 --> 00:36:56,466
Now you can rule...

145
00:36:56,853 --> 00:36:58,873
...in hell!

146
00:38:15,214 --> 00:38:17,373
Evening girls.
Looking well.

147
00:38:17,424 --> 00:38:19,234
Good evening Mr. Maguire.

148
00:38:22,156 --> 00:38:24,167
You dance great for an old lady.

149
00:38:24,488 --> 00:38:27,545
Someone told me to stop living on the sideline.

150
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:29,604
Well you sounds like the smart guy.

151
00:38:29,662 --> 00:38:30,971
He is.

152
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:23,780
Ciao-Ciao Shanghai,
Peru, here I come.
