1
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:02,848
Dubey!

2
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,642
Dubey!
- Not here.

3
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:08,270
Not here yet?
He's an impossible fellow!

4
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,856
Nearly 11:00. How to fix this?

5
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:30,042
He wants money
but doesn't want to work.

6
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,463
Dubeyji? Lalit Verma, who else?

7
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,673
Very kind of you to answer.

8
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:40,344
What's going on? No sign of anyone.

9
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:47,517
Fry the pakoras.
Tea for the master. Hurry!

10
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,861
God forbid it!
The wedding is so soon.

11
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:02,824
Hundreds of things to get tense about.

12
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,869
The marigold gate is falling apart.

13
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:08,288
The flowers are everywhere.
What's going on?

14
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:12,960
No need to get so upset, sir.

15
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:17,381
Flowers? What's a few flowers?

16
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:21,176
For you, I'll bring Kashmir's Mughal garden.

17
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,220
Just say the word.

18
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:26,014
I'm stranded in a traffic jam.

19
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,517
Enough! Get here on the double.

20
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:31,311
Ten minutes, exactly and approximately.

21
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,897
I can't phone and drive.

22
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,568
What's the idiot up to?

23
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:55,627
Where were you?

24
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,174
You're incredible.

25
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,488
The guests are on their way.

26
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,535
Did you? Out with the truth!

27
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,906
These are our laws.

28
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:51,868
Change the constitution,
then censorship will follow.

29
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,662
What do you think?

30
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:17,853
Let's hear some dialogue
from the new script.

31
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,062
Go ahead, please.

32
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,533
Give it to me.

33
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:34,536
Come on.

34
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,746
More, big boy. More.

35
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,125
I like it like that.

36
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:43,462
Big boy, I like it.

37
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,046
Give me more.

38
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:47,924
Come inside me.

39
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,969
Give it to me.

40
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:55,140
Come!

41
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,907
If he wants the works,

42
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:21,828
then he must get the cash out.

43
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:24,914
The one-rupee era is over.

44
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,584
Tea anyone?

45
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,336
Four teas.

46
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,379
- King Dubey!
- At your service.

47
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,048
Gracing us with your presence?

48
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,091
Your daughter is my daughter.
Why worry?

49
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:39,095
The wedding is in four days.

50
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,472
Today, the engagement.

51
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:42,223
The groom is on his way.

52
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,643
Want me to lose face?
- Important call.

53
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:45,935
Call my pager, damn it!

54
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,855
More important things to do?

55
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,274
Now you're an event manager.

56
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,360
Fix this now!
- Yadav!

57
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:55,111
Tameez-ud-din!

58
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,488
Lottery!

59
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,616
Get down. Fix it!

60
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:03,995
Insolent bums!
Want tea, do you? To work!

61
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,456
Right away!

62
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,210
Hi, Uncle!

63
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:14,047
King Dubey, move your van.

64
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:15,799
Move the van!

65
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:17,384
Where have you been?

66
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,312
How lovely!

67
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,650
Take it easy.

68
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,362
No, Ma.

69
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:23,867
I'll stop at the temple.
It may get late.

70
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:27,495
No, I won't eat at home.
I'll come late.

71
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:31,291
You can pack the food in the tiffin.

72
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:38,757
Forgive me.

73
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:53,354
Ma, leave the worrying
about the stock market to me.

74
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:55,774
I can deal with it.

75
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,819
Twelve rupees a minute
calling me on the mobile.

76
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:00,737
Hang up.

77
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:47,575
I saw cousin Aditi naked,
and I almost saw you naked too.

78
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,798
Enough.
Get dressed for the engagement.

79
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,986
What is it, my child?

80
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,907
In God's name,

81
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,660
what on earth is written here?

82
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:39,711
There is no such word, my child.

83
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,881
It's a spelling mistake.

84
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:48,136
There should be an L here.
It's "luxurious."

85
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,969
Brought the whiskey?

86
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,276
Anyone about?

87
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,196
Let's take the whiskey in.

88
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,822
Australian idiot - you!

89
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,747
We're hardly late.
You get tense for nothing.

90
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,596
Talk fast.
Can't catch the network.

91
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:16,432
Let me come down.

92
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:18,476
One minute!

93
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:22,355
Speak. No, no, no.

94
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:25,066
Yes, I'll be there.

95
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,904
That's correct. Take the advance.

96
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:34,492
Life's such a comedy.

97
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:38,204
No signal up there.
But there's one down here.

98
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:44,168
The virtuous virgin look
really suits me.

99
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,976
Breasts like baby mangoes.

100
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:03,855
The groom!

101
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:08,693
The groom's here!

102
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:19,287
Congratulations, Mr. Rai!

103
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,470
Pay your respects to Grandmother.

104
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,856
Look what I have for you.

105
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:13,609
Know why God arranged
your marriage in a hurry?

106
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:16,904
I told him I had to see
a great-grandson before dying.

107
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:18,114
He heard me!

108
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:25,288
How beautiful!

109
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:26,789
So fair and lovely.

110
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:29,500
Say hello to Hemant.

111
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:34,922
Enough!

112
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:41,554
I met C.L. only once,
and we got married right away!

113
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:51,439
Don't you feel like getting married?

114
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:19,383
Sweeten your mouths, my dears.

115
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:32,188
Just in time!

116
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:34,315
My dear brother-in-law!

117
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,108
Look at him.

118
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:00,383
What a complete idiot!

119
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:11,978
Calls my son an idiot,
then calls him a duffer.

120
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:13,646
Who does he think he is?

121
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,815
I'm not coming back to India.

122
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:40,006
My naughty niece,
couldn't you wait?

123
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:27,970
The motherfucker doesn't have
a dime to his name,

124
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:33,351
and he wants the White House theme
for his daughter's wedding!

125
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:37,063
How the fuck will that happen?

126
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:39,398
The swine hasn't any shit in him,

127
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:41,484
and he invites other pigs for dinner!

128
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:45,613
What?

129
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:48,324
- We need more ice.
- What?

130
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:53,788
I've told them once.

131
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:57,083
I've told them a thousand times
they'll need ice.

132
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,876
They never listen.

133
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:04,924
Now what?

134
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:08,469
Do you need some water?

135
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:11,305
Water?

136
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:20,481
Okay.

137
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,159
Fridge water or tap water?

138
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:39,583
Fridge water.

139
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:57,726
Our eyes made the right signal

140
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:02,940
And I found a partner for life

141
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:09,238
Shut up, you assholes!

142
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:16,203
I quit.

143
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,373
America makes everyone quit smoking.

144
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,749
The Rais are so cultured.

145
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:26,630
Speak a little English and you become
a very cultured family.

146
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:28,799
Rai!

147
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:54,575
Make her understand.

148
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:00,289
Lots of money in writing these days.

149
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:03,125
That girl who won the Booker Prize

150
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:06,462
became an overnight millionaire!

151
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:22,186
Two weddings in one!

152
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:30,319
I have anotherjoke.
Nonvegetarian!

153
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:39,828
Let me start rehearsing, then.

154
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:18,218
I won't listen to you
or to Ria's mother.

155
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:27,770
I can still work.

156
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:34,211
This is India's big problem.

157
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:40,384
Alice, has the fuse blown?

158
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:42,720
Alice! Get the phone.

159
00:28:58,194 --> 00:28:59,945
When are you arriving?

160
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:03,615
Yes, yes. She's here,
swinging on my shoulders.

161
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:05,951
The line's cut.

162
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:35,189
Sisterfucker, what a pain!

163
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:49,536
All the fuses have blown.

164
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:50,954
Pardon?

165
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:55,250
Which is the house fuse?

166
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:56,877
This one?

167
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,923
I'll fix it right away.

168
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:04,676
The light, a little closer, please.

169
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:10,265
A little to this side, please.

170
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:21,360
A little lower.

171
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,906
Your shadow is in the way.

172
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:29,618
A little closer.

173
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:02,359
Trying to say something?
It's hot today.

174
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:05,028
Switch it on. The power is back.

175
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,798
What a silly asshole I am.

176
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:06,358
Eat, Son, eat!

177
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:52,798
What is it?

178
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,215
Some gratitude.

179
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,218
We are so grateful, dear Pimmi.

180
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:48,270
This wedding is driving me crazy!

181
00:36:05,204 --> 00:36:07,080
Today will be a long day.

182
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:11,126
It's hot, too, after all that rain.

183
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:13,795
May I have...

184
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:16,089
a glass of water?

185
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,175
I'm very thirsty.

186
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:29,519
What is your good name?

187
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:34,983
It's an English name.

188
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:38,987
Where are you from?
- Bihar.

189
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:45,160
What's your name?

190
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,001
Parbatlal Kanhaiyalal Dubey.

191
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:57,005
But I've changed it to P.K. Dubey.

192
00:36:57,173 --> 00:37:01,635
But it makes people laugh.
In the city, they call me Dubeyji.

193
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,720
Parbatlal is a nice name.

194
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:18,777
They're newly printed.

195
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:23,114
I'm into event management.

196
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:27,244
It has the address to send mail
through the computer.

197
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,249
You know about it? Yes.

198
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:36,920
Keep it. Take some more.

199
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:39,339
This is fine.

200
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:52,894
Tell me you love me.

201
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:57,565
Have you seen the movie
Tell Me You Love Me?

202
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,192
Yes.

203
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:10,245
What happened?

204
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,247
Nothing happened.

205
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,917
I must be going.

206
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,899
Tell me something.

207
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:44,446
How many weddings
have I organized so far?

208
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:49,200
At least 150 or 175.

209
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:54,914
How come I'm not married yet?

210
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:01,296
My poor mother has grown old saying,

211
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:04,966
"Son, get me a daughter-in-law."

212
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:09,971
Now I've done my thinking.

213
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:14,142
I'll put an end
to my lonesome, vagabond life.

214
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:20,857
I'll find myself a decent, simple girl

215
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:24,444
and begin life as a family man.

216
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:30,867
The hope now is that
the next tent Dubey puts up

217
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:34,788
has Dubey entering as the groom.

218
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:37,499
Bravo!

219
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:40,335
I swear, pure genius!

220
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,129
Motherfucker.

221
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:47,092
Do I pay you to sit on your ass?
Get to work!

222
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:54,891
Coming, sir.

223
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:58,353
Not a minute of peace.

224
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:03,024
This is the limit. A white tent?

225
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:08,488
A white tent?

226
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:10,323
- Yes, sir.
- What's this "yes, sir"?

227
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:12,659
What's with the white tent?

228
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:17,163
This is the fashion these days.
Millennium style. Y2K dot.

229
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:18,706
Smart-ass!

230
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:22,252
A white tent!
Is this a wedding or a funeral?

231
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:25,880
I only have one daughter.
I don't want a white tent.

232
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:27,674
Put up a colorful tent.

233
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:29,384
Red, yellow, green, blue.

234
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:30,677
Okay. Yadav!

235
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:33,263
Get this down. It's not wanted.

236
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:34,889
He wants the old look.

237
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:36,599
Get it down.

238
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:39,018
What about the waterproofing?

239
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,854
It was never discussed.

240
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:42,689
What do you mean, Dubey?

241
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:46,693
The peacocks have stopped dancing.
It won't rain.

242
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:49,612
Peacocks? You've been smoking pot?

243
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:52,115
Okay, sir. Advance.

244
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:59,914
In foreign countries, deal is deal.

245
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,251
Look, sir.

246
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:06,588
See, everything in foreign style.
In writing.

247
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:09,257
The number of plates and spoons.

248
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:10,925
But no waterproofing.

249
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:13,344
You want more? Pay more.

250
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:16,598
How much?

251
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:27,692
$5,000.

252
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:31,571
I'm not a nonresident Indian.

253
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:35,492
Your garden is huge.
Well, your daughter is my daughter.

254
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:36,993
Advance, sir.

255
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:40,205
Today we work. Tomorrow, holiday.
Strike, day after.

256
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:43,833
Then our wedding.
- This is all I have now.

257
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:46,836
I'll give you the rest later.

258
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:49,839
This won't pay for a thing.

259
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:14,447
You'll fall sick.
A Popsicle, now?

260
00:42:16,575 --> 00:42:18,243
This one's for Hemant's sister.

261
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:21,120
You bought one
for his cousin in Bangalore?

262
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:22,956
So many cousins!

263
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,291
Look at this silk sari.

264
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:29,170
So smooth,
even a fly could slide on it.

265
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:33,758
Once your eyes behold its beauty,
the fly has gone.

266
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:36,511
It's too gaudy.

267
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:41,391
- Who's the bride?
- She's having a Popsicle outside.

268
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:00,743
Come!

269
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:46,140
Put them properly.

270
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:48,518
Over there.

271
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:50,186
All right.

272
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:06,285
Not a single flower in place yet.

273
00:46:58,273 --> 00:46:59,941
I knew it. She's a thief!

274
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:18,084
Motherfucker.

275
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:29,428
Motherfuckers!

276
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:32,181
She's not stealing. Fucking assholes!

277
00:47:55,747 --> 00:47:57,331
You don't come to golfthese days.

278
00:47:58,083 --> 00:48:00,251
I'm busy with my daughter's wedding.

279
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:20,313
How much do you need, pal?

280
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:21,397
$1 2,000.

281
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:34,368
A daughter's wedding,
that's what happens.

282
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:37,496
Or I'd be wiped out.

283
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:47,590
O women of the house

284
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:49,675
Decorate me with henna

285
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:58,935
Make these fair hands
beautiful with henna

286
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:08,277
Madhorama asks
which one shall we marry

287
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:13,741
Madhorama says
The Fat One

288
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:19,413
The Fat One needs
too large a bed to sleep on

289
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:28,005
- Let's drop her by the wayside
- Right on

290
00:49:30,258 --> 00:49:32,510
- We want another
- Right on

291
00:49:32,594 --> 00:49:34,762
We are fancy gentlemen

292
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:37,014
Brimming with lust and desire

293
00:49:37,182 --> 00:49:39,266
Life intoxicates us

294
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:43,813
Do I lie
- No way

295
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:56,283
Madhorama asks
which one shall we marry

296
00:49:58,036 --> 00:50:01,747
Madhorama says
The Fair One

297
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:07,628
The Fair One has the color of butter

298
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:13,300
She sleeps alone on the roof
as her lover pines for her below

299
00:50:13,468 --> 00:50:15,845
This is the one we'll have

300
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:17,805
This is the one we like

301
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:19,515
we will marry her

302
00:50:20,642 --> 00:50:24,478
Shashi, remember
when we were newlyweds?

303
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:26,313
Lalit and my brother would sleep.

304
00:50:26,481 --> 00:50:29,900
You'd come to my room
and tell me dirty jokes.

305
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:33,612
Your Lalit may have gone to sleep,

306
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:38,492
but my C.L. would never sleep,
nor would he let me sleep!

307
00:50:57,679 --> 00:51:00,389
Go! No men allowed!

308
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:08,647
Stick with me.
You'll have fun with me!

309
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:12,443
Cash in on the pleasures of life with me.

310
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:15,488
I'm giving birth!

311
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:22,995
Lemon juice. The henna's drying.

312
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:37,254
As I leave
for my father-in-law's house

313
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:43,177
I will take your dreams with me

314
00:53:55,857 --> 00:54:00,444
The gift of bracelets

315
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:05,532
Binds me in marriage

316
00:54:05,867 --> 00:54:11,413
My father, I leave
the palace of your love

317
00:54:11,873 --> 00:54:17,503
To become a stranger to you forever

318
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:26,822
How did they grow up so quickly?

319
00:58:40,808 --> 00:58:44,478
The Betrayal of your Erect Dick —
How does it feel?

320
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:55,567
Roll down the window.

321
01:00:57,362 --> 01:00:59,863
What are you doing here so late?

322
01:00:59,947 --> 01:01:01,615
None ofyour business.

323
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:03,450
Big words in English, eh?

324
01:01:03,534 --> 01:01:05,911
Should we take you to the station?

325
01:01:06,287 --> 01:01:07,954
Out. Out you come!

326
01:01:14,253 --> 01:01:16,088
Who do you thinkyou are?

327
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:17,923
You may have a bomb. Who knows?

328
01:01:20,134 --> 01:01:22,469
Get out right now.

329
01:01:23,471 --> 01:01:24,388
You too.

330
01:01:24,472 --> 01:01:26,682
Hands up. Bastard!

331
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:36,149
- Your time's up.
- Hands up, fucker!

332
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:38,902
- Home.
- Give it to me.

333
01:01:42,323 --> 01:01:44,491
A bride's henna-painted hands!

334
01:01:44,659 --> 01:01:46,118
You couldn't wait, eh?

335
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:51,915
Ifyou are in such a hurry,
come with me.

336
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:54,668
You'll be in for a treat.

337
01:02:04,011 --> 01:02:05,762
Shall I call your lover?

338
01:02:07,098 --> 01:02:08,140
Go get him.

339
01:02:08,766 --> 01:02:10,350
O hero!

340
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:14,521
Madam, stop!

341
01:02:18,359 --> 01:02:20,152
The bird has flown.

342
01:03:34,268 --> 01:03:35,936
Grab this, Lottery.

343
01:03:37,438 --> 01:03:38,438
Catch!

344
01:03:39,607 --> 01:03:40,607
Throw it!

345
01:03:46,405 --> 01:03:48,448
How should I arrange the colors?

346
01:03:48,616 --> 01:03:51,076
Any way you want.

347
01:03:54,205 --> 01:03:56,039
I'll nail it.

348
01:03:59,418 --> 01:04:01,628
Brothers, I'm going.

349
01:04:04,924 --> 01:04:06,007
Do without me.

350
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:08,927
- What's up?
- I'm not feeling well.

351
01:04:20,565 --> 01:04:22,691
I've worked with Dubeyji five years.

352
01:04:22,775 --> 01:04:24,651
I've never seen him like this.

353
01:04:24,735 --> 01:04:26,987
He isn't even eating marigolds.

354
01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:28,989
We must do something.

355
01:06:36,617 --> 01:06:37,659
Jaichandji!

356
01:06:37,743 --> 01:06:38,952
How's life?

357
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:42,163
I recognized you
at first glance, my friend.

358
01:06:43,416 --> 01:06:46,001
I haven't seen you around.
- I've been away for four years.

359
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:50,922
- What will you have?
- Two of your special teas.

360
01:06:51,090 --> 01:06:52,340
No sugar in mine.

361
01:06:52,425 --> 01:06:56,636
You've been brain washed by America.
No sugar, if you please.

362
01:06:57,805 --> 01:07:00,849
Yesterday, Naresh Sharma
was here from America.

363
01:07:00,933 --> 01:07:03,643
He wanted Sweet'N Low.
Can you imagine?

364
01:07:03,728 --> 01:07:05,645
We'll chat another time.

365
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:06,688
Absolutely.

366
01:09:14,775 --> 01:09:16,192
Move your bike, man.

367
01:09:18,445 --> 01:09:19,863
Move your bloody bike!

368
01:10:39,443 --> 01:10:41,194
He doesn't listen. I give up.

369
01:10:56,710 --> 01:10:58,253
Let's find him a nice boy.

370
01:11:08,847 --> 01:11:10,682
Our son will be a cook.

371
01:11:13,686 --> 01:11:14,727
A cook!

372
01:11:15,312 --> 01:11:17,689
He's just a kid.

373
01:11:28,784 --> 01:11:29,784
Yes, darling?

374
01:11:52,391 --> 01:11:54,475
You want to be an entertainer?

375
01:12:35,309 --> 01:12:37,310
Nothing has been decided.

376
01:13:02,961 --> 01:13:04,670
Son, listen to me.

377
01:13:27,236 --> 01:13:29,904
Alice, one minute.

378
01:13:31,448 --> 01:13:33,449
We wanted to talk to you.

379
01:13:33,659 --> 01:13:36,911
- We're sorry.
- We made a big mistake.

380
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:39,080
We didn't do it on purpose.

381
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:41,707
We couldn't see clearly.

382
01:13:41,875 --> 01:13:44,293
We made a mistake, Alice.

383
01:13:44,461 --> 01:13:47,505
We're sorry.

384
01:13:47,673 --> 01:13:49,090
It won't happen again.

385
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:10,166
Bravo! The stock has gone up.

386
01:17:10,917 --> 01:17:14,378
I told you before the stock would go up.

387
01:17:14,546 --> 01:17:18,007
But you thought your mother was a fool.

388
01:17:18,175 --> 01:17:20,760
That's what you had decided.

389
01:17:20,927 --> 01:17:23,971
"What does she know
about the stock market?"

390
01:17:24,139 --> 01:17:27,475
I knew it. It's up, isn't it?

391
01:17:28,018 --> 01:17:31,479
Now you go tomorrow
and sell the shares —

392
01:17:32,356 --> 01:17:33,606
Oh, God.

393
01:17:34,691 --> 01:17:37,026
What is the use of this money?

394
01:17:37,736 --> 01:17:41,155
I'll die before I see
the face ofa grandson.

395
01:17:41,698 --> 01:17:44,408
Your father's name
will sink without a trace.

396
01:17:45,410 --> 01:17:46,327
Listen.

397
01:17:46,787 --> 01:17:49,538
Did you tell the neighbors about the toilet?

398
01:17:49,831 --> 01:17:51,791
It's flooded again.

399
01:17:53,168 --> 01:17:55,586
What sin did I commit?

400
01:17:56,171 --> 01:17:58,547
You don't like any girl!

401
01:17:59,466 --> 01:18:02,009
Don't you feel like settling down?

402
01:18:03,470 --> 01:18:07,973
Ramesh is six months younger than you,
and he has two children.

403
01:18:08,266 --> 01:18:10,142
He earns halfwhat you do.

404
01:18:10,352 --> 01:18:14,980
Her mother shows off her grandsons
to make me jealous.

405
01:18:19,361 --> 01:18:22,029
Oh, God! Have you gone mad?

406
01:18:22,197 --> 01:18:24,281
Roaming about in your underwear!

407
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:57,708
After Partition,
we came here with nothing.

408
01:19:57,876 --> 01:19:59,835
Nowhere to go, no future.

409
01:20:00,003 --> 01:20:02,671
Tej's family looked after us.

410
01:20:02,964 --> 01:20:05,591
He educated us,
made us stand on our feet.

411
01:20:10,347 --> 01:20:13,015
There are no accounts between families.

412
01:20:13,183 --> 01:20:15,726
Now you're one of us.

413
01:20:15,811 --> 01:20:17,061
Welcome.

414
01:20:17,145 --> 01:20:20,564
"Your eyes brim with intoxication.

415
01:20:20,732 --> 01:20:23,943
Your skin glows
from the fragrance of rose petals."

416
01:20:32,577 --> 01:20:35,621
Don't take out
your parents' anger on me.

417
01:20:44,256 --> 01:20:48,175
May this enchanted evening glow forever.

418
01:21:57,787 --> 01:21:59,914
Bloody foreigner!

419
01:22:13,261 --> 01:22:16,764
"Only brave warriors fall
from their horses in battle.

420
01:22:17,849 --> 01:22:21,518
How can kneeling cowards
know what a fall is?"

421
01:24:02,203 --> 01:24:03,996
We're in-laws now.

422
01:24:57,509 --> 01:24:58,884
The idiot's dancing!

423
01:25:00,637 --> 01:25:01,929
Bravo!

424
01:25:52,981 --> 01:25:54,731
I love you, brother!

425
01:29:23,608 --> 01:29:26,610
You have listened
to everyone but Shashi.

426
01:29:31,532 --> 01:29:33,867
And now we present Shashiji!

427
01:29:36,204 --> 01:29:38,705
My throat is sore, but I'll try.

428
01:29:43,002 --> 01:29:44,503
Head straight here.

429
01:31:27,815 --> 01:31:29,107
Aliya, come.

430
01:31:30,401 --> 01:31:31,902
Troubling your mother?

431
01:32:01,098 --> 01:32:03,266
Did you see Tej Uncle?
That tall old man.

432
01:32:45,017 --> 01:32:46,851
Insolent, crazy girl!

433
01:35:36,230 --> 01:35:38,273
I'm falling, Pimmi. Hold me.

434
01:37:34,014 --> 01:37:35,807
Don't do this, my child.

435
01:37:37,351 --> 01:37:38,977
Let's go home.

436
01:38:00,541 --> 01:38:02,750
I don't understand. What can I do?

437
01:38:02,918 --> 01:38:05,336
You can do nothing, Uncle.

438
01:38:09,049 --> 01:38:10,675
Without you, the wedding can't happen.

439
01:38:31,780 --> 01:38:33,781
We are so indebted to them.

440
01:38:35,367 --> 01:38:37,035
Come home, I beg you.

441
01:38:37,953 --> 01:38:39,704
It's not your fault.

442
01:39:06,315 --> 01:39:07,941
Aren't you my little one?

443
01:39:26,752 --> 01:39:28,252
Everything will break.

444
01:40:22,725 --> 01:40:24,517
At the gentleman's feet.

445
01:40:54,923 --> 01:40:57,341
Come, darling.
Be blessed by your elders.

446
01:42:32,855 --> 01:42:34,981
You won't receive the groom.

447
01:43:00,174 --> 01:43:01,966
For such a small thing —

448
01:44:56,665 --> 01:44:57,623
Ready?

449
01:45:00,252 --> 01:45:02,753
The soaked in-laws are here.

450
01:45:06,967 --> 01:45:10,011
Verma family, forge ahead!

451
01:45:10,095 --> 01:45:11,721
Get drenched, bloody fools!

452
01:45:26,611 --> 01:45:27,820
Should I wear it?

453
01:45:33,869 --> 01:45:35,995
Take the groom in. He'll get wet.

454
01:46:00,437 --> 01:46:01,896
Be happy.

455
01:46:10,197 --> 01:46:14,408
Long live Mr. and Mrs. Dubey!

456
01:46:59,371 --> 01:47:01,247
Dubey and his lovely bride!

457
01:47:02,541 --> 01:47:05,376
It's your own tent.
You won't get wet.

458
01:47:25,355 --> 01:47:27,606
Fabulous waterproofing, Dubey!

459
01:47:53,216 --> 01:47:55,134
The bride is coming!

460
01:48:00,849 --> 01:48:01,932
Watch out!

461
01:48:03,768 --> 01:48:05,269
The wedding garlands!

462
01:48:24,206 --> 01:48:26,624
My son, Umang!

463
01:48:26,708 --> 01:48:30,169
My darling son, you're here!

464
01:48:38,929 --> 01:48:40,471
Bring on the music!

465
01:49:16,424 --> 01:49:18,968
We finally made an Indian out of you!

466
01:49:35,485 --> 01:49:38,696
Come on, Mrs. Dubey! Let's dance!
