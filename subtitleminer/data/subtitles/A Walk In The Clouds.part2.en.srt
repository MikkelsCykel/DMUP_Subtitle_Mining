1
00:00:03,592 --> 00:00:05,822
Of Victoria's life.

2
00:00:06,128 --> 00:00:10,087
Now that you are a part
of all this, a part of us...

3
00:00:11,233 --> 00:00:14,464
...it is the root of your life.

4
00:00:18,707 --> 00:00:23,076
You are an orphan no longer.

5
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:31,416
So you will stay with your family...

6
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,156
...while we harvest the fruit.

7
00:00:37,059 --> 00:00:41,257
It's a special time.
It's a time of magic!

8
00:00:43,432 --> 00:00:45,161
I really can't.

9
00:00:45,968 --> 00:00:47,526
I have commitments.

10
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:51,606
What about the commitments
to your family?

11
00:00:51,907 --> 00:00:57,243
- What can be more important than that?
- I would like to, really.

12
00:00:59,281 --> 00:01:00,771
But I can't.

13
00:01:05,421 --> 00:01:09,289
He said you would not stay.

14
00:01:10,292 --> 00:01:12,419
- Who did?
- Alberto.

15
00:01:12,828 --> 00:01:18,198
He said, "The first chance
that gringo gets...

16
00:01:18,767 --> 00:01:20,792
...he will leave her."

17
00:01:23,872 --> 00:01:27,103
- His exact words.
- I'm not leaving her...

18
00:01:27,376 --> 00:01:29,867
No, I understand.

19
00:01:30,145 --> 00:01:34,138
It's just my poor granddaughter.

20
00:01:34,783 --> 00:01:36,751
He will whip her with it.

21
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:41,922
She'll be the one to pay
for your "commitments."

22
00:01:42,191 --> 00:01:43,749
Such a pity.

23
00:01:45,894 --> 00:01:48,124
Such a sweet girl.

24
00:01:50,232 --> 00:01:54,862
- It's just the difference of a day.
- Our most important day.

25
00:01:55,137 --> 00:01:58,106
The day that makes
or breaks our fortunes.

26
00:01:58,373 --> 00:02:01,274
That's what he will throw up to her.

27
00:02:02,311 --> 00:02:04,802
For the rest of her life!

28
00:02:06,014 --> 00:02:07,948
I know...

29
00:02:08,317 --> 00:02:10,012
...my son.

30
00:02:16,358 --> 00:02:17,950
Don Pedro.

31
00:02:20,062 --> 00:02:21,290
You're right.

32
00:02:22,764 --> 00:02:25,824
It's only one day. I'll stay.

33
00:02:33,242 --> 00:02:34,436
Right.

34
00:02:37,179 --> 00:02:38,339
May I?

35
00:02:44,086 --> 00:02:49,046
It's a good thing. You have
no more chocolates to sell anyway.

36
00:03:00,969 --> 00:03:02,368
Come on.

37
00:03:19,154 --> 00:03:23,853
- I thought you were leaving.
- It's better for you if I stay.

38
00:03:24,126 --> 00:03:29,029
- At least until the harvest.
- Don't you have chocolates to sell?

39
00:03:30,499 --> 00:03:31,966
Family comes first.

40
00:03:37,506 --> 00:03:40,339
Hey, everybody. I'm home!

41
00:03:50,786 --> 00:03:52,686
Hiya, sis!

42
00:03:53,188 --> 00:03:54,917
Hi, Jose.

43
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:58,057
Hi, Grandpa.

44
00:04:00,329 --> 00:04:01,728
Hi, Grandma.

45
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:05,733
My favorite chili's ready?

46
00:04:09,371 --> 00:04:12,738
- Hi, Mom.
- At last!

47
00:04:14,009 --> 00:04:17,206
Hi, Pop. Sorry I'm late.

48
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:26,219
This is my husband, Paul Sutton.
Paul, my brother.

49
00:04:27,823 --> 00:04:29,723
You got hitched?

50
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:32,290
That's swell!

51
00:04:36,598 --> 00:04:40,534
Victoria Sutton. I like that.

52
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:45,438
- Welcome to the family. I'm Pete.
- Thanks.

53
00:04:48,243 --> 00:04:50,177
Who is "Pete"?

54
00:04:51,246 --> 00:04:53,976
- Pa, come on.
- I don't know any Pete.

55
00:04:54,249 --> 00:04:57,150
I pay a fortune
to Stanford University...

56
00:04:57,486 --> 00:05:00,580
...for a Pedro Alberto
Aragon Limantour.

57
00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:06,259
Maybe I'm paying for the wrong person,
and I should stop the check.

58
00:05:07,429 --> 00:05:10,796
- Glad to meet you, Pedro.
- Can we begin now?

59
00:05:13,101 --> 00:05:15,501
Make sure he knows what to do.

60
00:05:15,771 --> 00:05:20,538
We don't want him cutting himself
and getting blood on the grapes.

61
00:05:20,842 --> 00:05:23,333
It'll ruin the taste of the wine.

62
00:05:27,049 --> 00:05:29,176
Aren't you happy you stayed?

63
00:08:32,801 --> 00:08:34,325
Come on!

64
00:08:41,743 --> 00:08:44,974
- How do they feel?
- They're a little big.

65
00:08:45,247 --> 00:08:50,310
Like family, you must live in clothes
for a while before they fit.

66
00:08:50,585 --> 00:08:55,818
- But you are doing great.
- Not everyone would agree.

67
00:08:56,424 --> 00:08:59,860
It's not easy being in charge.
It wasn't for me.

68
00:09:00,528 --> 00:09:04,396
It's not easy for him.
Every man must find his own way.

69
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:10,002
But I have faith in my son.
And I have faith in you.

70
00:09:10,672 --> 00:09:12,537
But your fly is open.

71
00:09:37,465 --> 00:09:39,990
My wife's family, the Aztecs...

72
00:09:40,302 --> 00:09:43,396
...believe that you must
have permission...

73
00:09:43,672 --> 00:09:47,768
...of the four winds to harvest
what the earth gives.

74
00:09:53,315 --> 00:09:55,283
Isn't she beautiful?

75
00:10:08,897 --> 00:10:11,798
Come on, you're a married woman now!

76
00:10:12,534 --> 00:10:13,967
What about Pedro?

77
00:10:14,302 --> 00:10:17,567
- He's not married.
- Neither are we.

78
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:41,006
I want you more than anything.
You can't imagine how I want you.

79
00:13:41,442 --> 00:13:43,205
But I'm not free.

80
00:13:44,913 --> 00:13:46,972
I won't hurt you that way.

81
00:13:48,383 --> 00:13:49,680
I won't.

82
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,282
I'm sorry.

83
00:13:54,522 --> 00:13:55,716
I'm sorry.

84
00:14:47,842 --> 00:14:52,336
- We can lead the market, not chase it.
- Where's my hat?

85
00:14:52,614 --> 00:14:55,447
Raise money through
limited partnerships.

86
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:59,277
- Hi, Paul.
- Hi, Pedro. Good morning, Mr. Aragon.

87
00:14:59,854 --> 00:15:03,449
- So, what do you think, Pop?
- About what?

88
00:15:03,758 --> 00:15:07,125
Modernizing the operation,
limited partnerships?

89
00:15:07,462 --> 00:15:12,422
- A partner equals trouble.
- You can always borrow from the bank.

90
00:15:14,435 --> 00:15:19,771
Listen, just because you harvested
a few grapes doesn't give you a say.

91
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:23,067
Stick to your candy and keep
your nose out of our business.

92
00:15:25,246 --> 00:15:28,511
Now, tell me what's going on here.

93
00:15:28,816 --> 00:15:33,116
That you sleep one night on the floor,
the next on the couch?

94
00:15:33,421 --> 00:15:37,755
You'll use any excuse to make him
feel unwelcome, won't you?

95
00:15:38,026 --> 00:15:43,157
There's something wrong here.
This whole thing smells wrong.

96
00:15:43,364 --> 00:15:47,460
A girl comes home with
a husband nobody ever heard of...

97
00:15:47,769 --> 00:15:52,069
...with her suitcase as full
as when she went away.

98
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:56,037
Like she has no place else to go.
Where's my hat?

99
00:15:56,311 --> 00:15:59,872
You don't want me here? I'll leave.

100
00:16:00,148 --> 00:16:04,744
- Is that what you want?
- I want the truth.

101
00:16:05,019 --> 00:16:07,579
- That's what I want.
- No, you don't.

102
00:16:07,855 --> 00:16:11,347
The truth you want
is the truth according to you.

103
00:16:11,626 --> 00:16:14,220
That's the only truth you accept.

104
00:16:16,731 --> 00:16:18,289
Try me.

105
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,280
The truth is, she came home
because she loves her family.

106
00:16:41,089 --> 00:16:45,321
I told you, stay out of our business.

107
00:16:46,027 --> 00:16:48,120
She is my business.

108
00:16:50,832 --> 00:16:52,766
You were looking for this?

109
00:17:14,689 --> 00:17:16,316
Se<i>n</i>ora!

110
00:17:20,962 --> 00:17:23,453
Thank you, but I don't have time.

111
00:17:23,765 --> 00:17:27,861
- It smells!
- I have to leave. I have business.

112
00:17:28,202 --> 00:17:31,535
Don Pedro has finished
your business, no?

113
00:17:31,806 --> 00:17:35,708
And besides, you must see it through.

114
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:41,011
- See what through?
- Your fate. What brought you here.

115
00:17:41,282 --> 00:17:45,082
Nothing brought me here.
I brought me here.

116
00:18:00,668 --> 00:18:02,568
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

117
00:18:02,837 --> 00:18:06,034
- Let me help you.
- No, we had a plan.

118
00:18:06,307 --> 00:18:10,107
You were to stay one night
and go back to your wife.

119
00:18:10,411 --> 00:18:14,108
- Stick to the plan.
- I can't leave you like this.

120
00:18:14,415 --> 00:18:17,907
And tomorrow?
Will you stay tomorrow too?

121
00:18:18,252 --> 00:18:20,186
And the day after that?

122
00:18:21,088 --> 00:18:23,056
Go home, Paul.

123
00:18:23,591 --> 00:18:25,718
You still have a wife.

124
00:18:26,294 --> 00:18:29,127
- Here. Leave it at the station.
- Please.

125
00:18:29,464 --> 00:18:32,228
You can't help me anymore!

126
00:18:33,835 --> 00:18:35,928
No one can help me.

127
00:18:36,938 --> 00:18:38,929
It's not your problem.

128
00:18:45,346 --> 00:18:47,246
It's not my problem.

129
00:18:47,949 --> 00:18:49,541
I can't leave.

130
00:18:50,551 --> 00:18:51,813
I can't.

131
00:19:10,238 --> 00:19:13,173
Don't think just because
you married her...

132
00:19:13,474 --> 00:19:17,501
...any of this is yours.
If you married her at all.

133
00:19:18,312 --> 00:19:21,645
- What do you mean?
- I wasn't there.

134
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:26,080
I didn't see a wedding,
or even a wedding certificate.

135
00:19:30,224 --> 00:19:34,627
And don't think that just because
I speak with an accent...

136
00:19:34,929 --> 00:19:37,056
...I think with an accent.

137
00:19:38,399 --> 00:19:41,027
For the four years
that I've been at war...

138
00:19:41,369 --> 00:19:44,031
...I had to keep myself closed off.

139
00:19:44,906 --> 00:19:48,842
- What's your reason?
- What are you talking about?

140
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:53,308
- Reason for what?
- Shutting Victoria out of your heart.

141
00:19:53,781 --> 00:19:56,773
Can't you see how amazing she is?
How alive?

142
00:19:57,952 --> 00:20:02,218
I dream of getting the kind
of love she tries to give you.

143
00:20:03,357 --> 00:20:05,689
I would die for what you have.

144
00:20:08,429 --> 00:20:12,559
Why can't you just love her?
She's so easy to love.

145
00:20:13,067 --> 00:20:15,627
You know nothing about my daughter!

146
00:20:15,937 --> 00:20:17,632
You hear me? Nothing!

147
00:20:17,939 --> 00:20:20,840
I know that she is good and strong...

148
00:20:21,108 --> 00:20:26,011
...and deserves all the love this
world has to give. Can't you see?

149
00:20:26,347 --> 00:20:30,113
How wonderful,
how special she is?

150
00:20:30,551 --> 00:20:32,178
You see this?

151
00:20:32,553 --> 00:20:36,148
This land? This vineyard?

152
00:20:36,591 --> 00:20:40,960
This is 36<i>5</i> days a year.

153
00:20:41,596 --> 00:20:44,030
Who do you think I do this for?

154
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:45,964
For them.

155
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,460
All of them! I love my family!

156
00:20:50,738 --> 00:20:52,535
You should let them know.

157
00:21:19,967 --> 00:21:22,231
Paul? Hey, Paul.

158
00:21:23,838 --> 00:21:25,601
Brandy!

159
00:21:26,607 --> 00:21:27,869
The finest.

160
00:21:28,142 --> 00:21:31,600
I made it myself...

161
00:21:32,413 --> 00:21:34,540
...21 years ago.

162
00:21:34,849 --> 00:21:38,751
The secret about brandy is age.

163
00:21:39,086 --> 00:21:43,284
The secret of everything...

164
00:21:43,824 --> 00:21:45,291
...is age.

165
00:21:45,993 --> 00:21:48,928
<i>Hi</i>j<i>a,</i> are you all right?

166
00:21:50,031 --> 00:21:51,896
He only went to work.

167
00:21:52,199 --> 00:21:54,133
He will come back.

168
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:04,705
What the hell is that?

169
00:22:05,012 --> 00:22:06,639
My uniform.

170
00:22:08,449 --> 00:22:10,144
Of course.

171
00:22:10,518 --> 00:22:11,883
Newlyweds!

172
00:22:12,153 --> 00:22:16,249
What else do they do
but make love and war?

173
00:22:20,127 --> 00:22:22,960
- Did you talk to her?
- I tried.

174
00:22:23,297 --> 00:22:27,256
Wouldn't make a difference.
Talking between men and women...

175
00:22:27,568 --> 00:22:31,470
...never solves anything.
Where we think...

176
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:34,166
...they feel.

177
00:22:34,809 --> 00:22:39,644
They are creatures of the heart.

178
00:22:40,081 --> 00:22:42,447
Please, sit down.

179
00:22:43,884 --> 00:22:46,148
No, no. Please, come on.

180
00:22:46,487 --> 00:22:47,749
Give me that.

181
00:22:48,689 --> 00:22:52,682
- I'll miss my bus again.
- Make yourself comfortable.

182
00:22:52,993 --> 00:22:56,622
Tomorrow we go to the festival
for the wine blessing.

183
00:22:56,931 --> 00:22:58,831
The bus will be there.

184
00:22:59,166 --> 00:23:04,433
I have the perfect solution for you.

185
00:23:53,254 --> 00:23:54,414
Thank you.

186
00:23:54,722 --> 00:23:58,158
Isn't that the most romantic thing
you ever heard?

187
00:23:58,425 --> 00:24:02,361
- Maybe it loses a bit on translation.
- No, no.

188
00:24:09,403 --> 00:24:10,734
Now you sing.

189
00:24:19,413 --> 00:24:21,881
It's all right.

190
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:28,053
You did wonderful. Let's let
the experts do it themselves.

191
00:24:52,379 --> 00:24:55,906
You're a gringo.
Nice, but still a gringo.

192
00:24:56,217 --> 00:24:59,209
The heart you are talking to
is Mexican.

193
00:24:59,486 --> 00:25:03,422
You speak to it in
the language it understands.

194
00:25:03,724 --> 00:25:05,123
You...

195
00:25:07,728 --> 00:25:10,128
You be strong.

196
00:25:10,965 --> 00:25:13,092
You stand right here.

197
00:25:13,467 --> 00:25:14,934
Right here.

198
00:25:23,644 --> 00:25:25,839
No, no. You've had enough.

199
00:25:26,914 --> 00:25:30,008
All right. You boys,
wait for my signal.

200
00:26:11,592 --> 00:26:12,820
Alberto...

201
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,750
Listen.

202
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:56,701
You watch her window.
When the light comes on...

203
00:26:57,004 --> 00:26:59,268
...you are saved!

204
00:27:00,441 --> 00:27:02,375
Just watch the window.

205
00:27:10,851 --> 00:27:13,411
He seems to love her.

206
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:18,021
Maybe...

207
00:27:18,692 --> 00:27:21,126
...l've been too tough on him.

208
00:27:41,215 --> 00:27:42,807
What's the matter?

209
00:28:41,408 --> 00:28:43,171
Don't have too much fun.

210
00:28:43,544 --> 00:28:46,536
- Our bus leaves in 10 minutes.
- Thanks.

211
00:29:10,771 --> 00:29:13,569
The Aragons!
The Aragons are coming!

212
00:29:41,168 --> 00:29:43,329
Hello, how are you?

213
00:29:44,905 --> 00:29:46,702
- Marie Jose.
- <i>Padre.</i>

214
00:29:50,077 --> 00:29:53,103
I will now recite
the Blessing of the Harvest.

215
00:29:53,847 --> 00:29:58,284
We thank you, Lord, for bestowing
on us the bounty of thy harvest.

216
00:29:58,619 --> 00:30:03,852
We ask that each life here be blessed
with the full measure of love...

217
00:30:04,158 --> 00:30:05,682
...health and happiness...

218
00:30:05,993 --> 00:30:10,521
...that those who acknowledge God
justly deserve. Amen.

219
00:30:10,998 --> 00:30:12,192
Amen.

220
00:30:27,514 --> 00:30:29,641
Excellent!

221
00:30:49,836 --> 00:30:52,600
Your serenade was very beautiful.

222
00:30:54,641 --> 00:30:56,575
Will you toast with me?

223
00:31:01,348 --> 00:31:02,747
What do we toast to?

224
00:31:03,984 --> 00:31:06,350
To "what if."

225
00:31:08,822 --> 00:31:10,289
To "what if."

226
00:31:15,329 --> 00:31:16,318
Father Filipo...

227
00:31:16,663 --> 00:31:20,121
...may I introduce Paul Sutton,
my new son-in-law.

228
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:23,435
As you can see, a bona fide war hero.

229
00:31:24,037 --> 00:31:26,801
- He helped bring in the harvest.
- Papa.

230
00:31:27,341 --> 00:31:29,502
What? I can't be proud?

231
00:31:29,776 --> 00:31:33,507
- A blessed surprise. Congratulations!
- Thank you, Father.

232
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:35,611
I gave her First Communion.

233
00:31:35,916 --> 00:31:39,511
- Thought I'd give her in marriage.
- And you shall.

234
00:31:39,786 --> 00:31:43,950
City hall is not a proper place
to take your wedding vows.

235
00:31:44,258 --> 00:31:46,226
Not for my only daughter.

236
00:31:46,693 --> 00:31:48,957
Tonight... Listen to me!

237
00:31:49,296 --> 00:31:54,029
Tonight, I give my daughter's
hand in marriage...

238
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:56,199
...before the eyes of God.

239
00:31:56,536 --> 00:32:00,199
And I will take it
as a personal insult...

240
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:02,906
...if you all do not show up.

241
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:05,041
You are all invited!

242
00:32:05,312 --> 00:32:10,215
- Why are you doing this?
- A man can change his mind, can't he?

243
00:32:12,786 --> 00:32:15,186
- We must tell them.
- No.

244
00:32:15,489 --> 00:32:17,457
I have to tell them.

245
00:32:17,791 --> 00:32:20,225
I'm not scared now.

246
00:32:21,662 --> 00:32:23,129
Here.

247
00:32:27,434 --> 00:32:29,061
For the baby.

248
00:32:30,637 --> 00:32:32,036
A little present.

249
00:32:33,774 --> 00:32:37,904
- What did you get it for?
- Courage under fire.

250
00:32:40,514 --> 00:32:42,345
Paul Sutton...

251
00:32:42,649 --> 00:32:46,107
...you are the most honorable man
I have ever known.

252
00:34:10,103 --> 00:34:12,435
- Where to, soldier?
- San Francisco.

253
00:34:12,739 --> 00:34:16,368
I can get you as far as San Rafael.
Climb in.

254
00:34:17,177 --> 00:34:18,644
Thanks.

255
00:34:22,115 --> 00:34:25,551
- What you doing around here?
- Walking.

256
00:34:25,886 --> 00:34:27,012
Walking?

257
00:34:28,288 --> 00:34:29,778
In the clouds.

258
00:34:31,425 --> 00:34:33,859
Welcome back to earth.

259
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:46,887
- Who's there?
- It's me.

260
00:36:55,035 --> 00:36:57,265
- You read them.
- Yes, Paul...

261
00:36:57,571 --> 00:36:58,799
Betty?

262
00:37:00,206 --> 00:37:04,040
Listen, it wasn't gonna work,
for either of us.

263
00:37:04,377 --> 00:37:06,504
Had I read the letters sooner...

264
00:37:06,846 --> 00:37:10,680
We hardly knew each other.
We want different things.

265
00:37:10,951 --> 00:37:12,350
Who is it, Betty?

266
00:37:13,053 --> 00:37:15,681
I don't even like dogs!

267
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:19,620
It's not what it appears to be.

268
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:23,195
- Armisted?
- Paul, listen to me.

269
00:37:23,597 --> 00:37:26,498
It would have never worked for me.

270
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,325
- I'd be miserable!
- I came back...

271
00:37:29,636 --> 00:37:31,570
- You have a gun?
- I was ready.

272
00:37:31,905 --> 00:37:36,569
- Don't do anything crazy.
- I'll leave. Don't hit me!

273
00:37:37,744 --> 00:37:39,473
I'm not gonna hit you.

274
00:37:44,884 --> 00:37:46,146
Betty...

275
00:37:47,053 --> 00:37:49,044
We could still be friends.

276
00:37:50,056 --> 00:37:51,546
Friends?

277
00:37:53,627 --> 00:37:56,721
I thought an annulment
would be easiest.

278
00:38:04,004 --> 00:38:06,598
You just have to sign it.

279
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:14,738
I'm sorry, Paul.

280
00:38:30,296 --> 00:38:33,265
Paul, are you all right?

281
00:38:35,468 --> 00:38:37,026
Yeah.

282
00:38:38,505 --> 00:38:39,972
I'm fine!

283
00:39:53,913 --> 00:39:55,642
Mr. Aragon?

284
00:40:01,554 --> 00:40:03,044
Mr. Aragon.

285
00:40:11,431 --> 00:40:13,695
I owe you an apology, sir.

286
00:40:14,033 --> 00:40:17,469
- What I did was wrong.
- Get off my land!

287
00:40:17,804 --> 00:40:20,830
My intentions were to protect her.

288
00:40:21,141 --> 00:40:24,133
- Stay away from her.
- I can't.

289
00:40:24,444 --> 00:40:26,309
She's like the air to me.

290
00:40:26,646 --> 00:40:29,740
I'm asking you for her hand
in marriage.

291
00:40:30,049 --> 00:40:34,509
You are already married,
you son of a bitch!

292
00:40:34,888 --> 00:40:37,152
- My gun!
- Don Alberto?

293
00:40:37,423 --> 00:40:39,015
My gun! Now!

294
00:40:39,793 --> 00:40:44,856
My marriage wasn't meant to be.
It was a mistake. But it's over.

295
00:40:45,465 --> 00:40:48,332
- Annulled.
- You deceived me!

296
00:40:48,935 --> 00:40:51,870
In my own house! In my own bed!

297
00:40:52,305 --> 00:40:54,739
Stay away from her!

298
00:40:55,008 --> 00:40:59,342
I want to be with her
forever and take care of her.

299
00:40:59,646 --> 00:41:02,672
- Jose, my gun!
- Victoria!

300
00:41:04,584 --> 00:41:06,017
Paul?

301
00:41:06,653 --> 00:41:09,247
You made me a fool to everyone.

302
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:16,153
- It's not your child she carries!
- It will be if she'll have me.

303
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:20,094
I'll see you dead first!

304
00:41:20,934 --> 00:41:21,866
Paul!

305
00:41:29,876 --> 00:41:33,073
Stop! I love him!

306
00:41:33,379 --> 00:41:34,812
I love him!

307
00:41:41,788 --> 00:41:43,050
My God!

308
00:41:51,197 --> 00:41:52,391
Papa!

309
00:41:56,035 --> 00:41:57,832
What have I done?

310
00:42:16,589 --> 00:42:17,920
Drunk!

311
00:42:18,224 --> 00:42:19,156
Please!

312
00:43:04,771 --> 00:43:05,965
Let me go!

313
00:43:07,407 --> 00:43:08,533
Get away!

314
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:18,142
Lie down, Pedro!

315
00:43:18,451 --> 00:43:19,349
Don't run!

316
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:22,315
Lie down!

317
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:38,535
I'm all right!

318
00:44:54,414 --> 00:44:55,938
Papa?

319
00:44:59,752 --> 00:45:02,414
I was afraid.

320
00:45:05,892 --> 00:45:08,622
I was afraid of losing you.

321
00:45:12,565 --> 00:45:14,499
All of you.

322
00:45:20,406 --> 00:45:24,342
I didn't know any other way to love.

323
00:45:30,116 --> 00:45:32,209
Can you teach me?

324
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:38,049
Please, can you teach me?

325
00:46:01,414 --> 00:46:03,382
The fire burned through...

326
00:46:03,649 --> 00:46:05,583
...everything.

327
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:09,980
There's no root stock left...

328
00:46:10,223 --> 00:46:11,850
...to replant.

329
00:46:15,461 --> 00:46:17,224
<i>Las Nubes...</i>

330
00:46:19,665 --> 00:46:21,633
...is finished.

331
00:48:19,518 --> 00:48:21,782
Has it reached the inside?

332
00:48:39,071 --> 00:48:40,561
It's alive.

333
00:48:43,075 --> 00:48:44,235
It's alive.

334
00:48:44,910 --> 00:48:47,003
<i>Las Nubes</i> lives!

335
00:48:48,648 --> 00:48:50,172
We can plant!

336
00:48:57,123 --> 00:48:58,283
This...

337
00:48:58,991 --> 00:49:01,255
...is the root...

338
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:03,494
...of your life.

339
00:49:05,631 --> 00:49:09,067
The root of your family.

340
00:49:10,736 --> 00:49:13,261
You are bound to this land...

341
00:49:13,572 --> 00:49:15,767
...and to this family...

342
00:49:16,442 --> 00:49:18,103
...by commitment...

343
00:49:18,477 --> 00:49:19,944
...by honor...

344
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:23,377
...and by love.

345
00:49:25,251 --> 00:49:27,116
Plant it.

346
00:49:27,787 --> 00:49:29,550
It will grow.

347
00:49:33,492 --> 00:49:35,357
I don't know how.

348
00:49:40,366 --> 00:49:41,594
Victoria...

349
00:49:42,101 --> 00:49:43,932
...help your husband.

350
00:50:30,383 --> 00:50:32,943
It's beautiful!
