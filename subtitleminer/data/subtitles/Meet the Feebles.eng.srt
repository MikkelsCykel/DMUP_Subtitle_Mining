Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:08,617
Welcome to the newest,
the greatest...

3
00:00:08,779 --> 00:00:12,010
the most spectacular
show in entertainment history.

4
00:00:12,578 --> 00:00:18,847
Put your hands together for
the fabulous Feebles Variety Hour!

5
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:27,329
<i>Meet the Feebles,
meet the Feebles...</i>

6
00:00:28,337 --> 00:00:31,089
<i>We're not average ordinary people.</i>

7
00:00:31,216 --> 00:00:34,891
<i>Meet the Feebles,
meet the Feebles.</i>

8
00:00:37,616 --> 00:00:41,085
<i>Animal acts
and other attractions.</i>

9
00:00:41,335 --> 00:00:44,247
<i>Bring me a pussy
and I show you some action.</i>

10
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:45,568
<i>I'm a contortionist.</i>

11
00:00:45,694 --> 00:00:47,366
<i>A modernist.
An hippopotamus.</i>

12
00:00:47,494 --> 00:00:50,054
<i>Be sure we guarantee
to amuse you.</i>

13
00:00:50,174 --> 00:00:51,970
<i>Wait to meet the Feebles.</i>

14
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:54,210
<i>Meet the Feebles,
meet the Feebles.</i>

15
00:00:54,334 --> 00:00:57,325
<i>We're not average ordinary people.</i>

16
00:00:57,453 --> 00:01:03,846
<i>Meet the Feebles,
Meet the Feebles.</i>

17
00:01:04,292 --> 00:01:07,045
And now...

18
00:01:07,292 --> 00:01:09,681
here's...

19
00:01:10,492 --> 00:01:12,004
Harry.

20
00:01:12,171 --> 00:01:15,925
Yipeee! Ha ha!
Hi, folks!

21
00:01:16,051 --> 00:01:18,769
Welcome to the Feebles
Variety Hour.

22
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:21,802
Oh boy, what a line-up
we've got for you tonight.

23
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:27,089
But first, give a huge reception
to our very own Venus...

24
00:01:27,289 --> 00:01:31,601
that gorgeous hunk
of hippo-hood, Heidi!

25
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:40,601
<i>I'm Heidi, hi!</i>

26
00:01:40,727 --> 00:01:42,241
<i>I love you all.</i>

27
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:45,723
<i>You're as pretty as me,
but I'm the star.</i>

28
00:01:45,847 --> 00:01:48,725
<i>I put on my best,
my talents are huge.</i>

29
00:01:48,847 --> 00:01:50,723
<i>We've got a show...</i>

30
00:01:50,846 --> 00:01:53,758
<i>but it's about to start
to meet the Feebles.</i>

31
00:01:53,886 --> 00:01:55,239
<i>Meet the Feebles.</i>

32
00:01:55,366 --> 00:01:58,802
<i>We're not average
ordinary people.</i>

33
00:01:58,926 --> 00:02:02,758
<i>Meet the Feebles,
meet the Feebles.</i>

34
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:08,724
All right you fat slag,
move your ass!

35
00:02:10,284 --> 00:02:16,153
How dare you speak to me like that,
you horrible, spiteful little rat!

36
00:02:17,043 --> 00:02:20,115
I've heard better singing from
a mongoose with throat cancer.

37
00:02:20,243 --> 00:02:22,517
I won't stand for this treatment
any longer.

38
00:02:22,682 --> 00:02:25,913
I'm an artiste.
I demand respect.

39
00:02:26,042 --> 00:02:28,430
Artiste, that's a good one.

40
00:02:28,561 --> 00:02:30,393
That's it!
I've had enough!

41
00:02:30,522 --> 00:02:33,831
- I'm going straight to Bletch.
- You do that darling.

42
00:02:34,961 --> 00:02:36,838
What is going on over there?

43
00:02:36,701 --> 00:02:38,259
Heidi, where are you going?

44
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,859
Have you upset her again?

45
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,329
You know what happens
when she gets into a tizz.

46
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:45,098
The old cow's had it too good
for too long.

47
00:02:45,219 --> 00:02:48,256
Like it or not, Trevor,
she's the star of the show.

48
00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:50,210
There's no Feebles without Heidi.

49
00:02:50,659 --> 00:02:52,058
Come on everybody.

50
00:02:52,179 --> 00:02:54,454
We're going out live
in twelve hours.

51
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:59,246
Heaven forbid injecting
some urgency into this occasion...

52
00:02:59,378 --> 00:03:01,413
but for God's sake
get a move on!

53
00:03:02,378 --> 00:03:04,811
Have a good rehearsal, Miss Heidi.

54
00:03:10,856 --> 00:03:13,371
Bleeetch!

55
00:03:26,974 --> 00:03:27,963
Oh, shit!

56
00:03:28,094 --> 00:03:30,688
I was just about
to pop my cookies!

57
00:03:33,573 --> 00:03:38,328
Sorry, Heidi, I was just
finishing off some paperwork.

58
00:03:39,293 --> 00:03:41,568
Trevor's been insulting me.

59
00:03:41,693 --> 00:03:43,922
Why, that foul-mouthed little rodent.

60
00:03:44,092 --> 00:03:46,652
I'll give him a good talking to.

61
00:03:46,772 --> 00:03:49,161
If it happens again,
I shan't perform.

62
00:03:49,292 --> 00:03:51,760
There there Heidi,
don't upset yourself.

63
00:03:54,571 --> 00:03:56,323
Do I smell perfume?

64
00:03:56,931 --> 00:03:59,922
You're imagining things
my sweet.

65
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:03,599
Now you go and rest up.
Big night tonight.

66
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:06,279
Come to my room later on?

67
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:09,245
I'll try.

68
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:14,798
Oh God!
Women!

69
00:04:15,968 --> 00:04:18,278
When are you going to dump
that huckery moll?

70
00:04:18,369 --> 00:04:21,962
Huckery moll she may be,
but she's also our major drawcard.

71
00:04:22,087 --> 00:04:24,397
Show some guts, Bletch!
Get rid of her!

72
00:04:24,528 --> 00:04:27,803
- God, wouldn't like to!
- I'm not waiting around for ever.

73
00:04:27,927 --> 00:04:30,919
Don't worry, honey.
I'm working on it.

74
00:04:44,005 --> 00:04:47,281
Excuse me, please.
I wonder if you can help me.

75
00:04:47,964 --> 00:04:51,195
I've a letter here requesting me
to report to the stage manager.

76
00:04:51,484 --> 00:04:53,679
I'm busy.
Ask somebody else.

77
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:56,956
Oh, well, no... you see...

78
00:05:03,723 --> 00:05:07,476
Excuse me, sir.
I wonder if you can help.

79
00:05:07,562 --> 00:05:10,122
I've a letter here asking me
to report to the stage manager.

80
00:05:10,242 --> 00:05:11,311
I don't know man.

81
00:05:12,442 --> 00:05:14,477
It's been a hell of a day.

82
00:05:14,601 --> 00:05:16,751
I can feel a migraine coming on.

83
00:05:16,881 --> 00:05:19,076
I need a paracetamol.

84
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:33,949
Up here!

85
00:05:37,278 --> 00:05:39,428
New boy are you?
Looking for Arthur?

86
00:05:39,558 --> 00:05:41,196
Is he the stage manager?

87
00:05:41,318 --> 00:05:43,228
That's what he calls himself.

88
00:05:43,437 --> 00:05:46,395
You'll never find him.
I'll take you there.

89
00:05:46,557 --> 00:05:48,673
Thank you very much.

90
00:05:48,797 --> 00:05:52,675
I had an audition six months ago
and I've just got the confirmation...

91
00:05:52,796 --> 00:05:55,072
of my acceptance
into the Feeble Chorus.

92
00:05:55,197 --> 00:05:57,187
I tell you what, kiddo.

93
00:05:57,316 --> 00:05:58,794
It's not that crash hot.

94
00:05:58,915 --> 00:06:01,350
They run you ragged
and they pay's lousy.

95
00:06:01,876 --> 00:06:04,070
I'm not worried about the pay.

96
00:06:04,195 --> 00:06:07,107
It's an honour just to get a chance...

97
00:06:07,195 --> 00:06:08,832
to perform in the show.

98
00:06:08,954 --> 00:06:10,946
I've been an admirer
of the Feebles for such a long time.

99
00:06:11,075 --> 00:06:12,029
Yeah?

100
00:06:12,194 --> 00:06:15,663
You'll find it pretty tough
on the wages they dish out.

101
00:06:15,793 --> 00:06:19,024
But if you ever want to earn
a little extra on the side...

102
00:06:19,153 --> 00:06:22,589
I'm always interested
in little stories...

103
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:25,391
anything spicy
or even smutty.

104
00:06:26,472 --> 00:06:29,703
Hey Arthur!
There's a new boy to see you.

105
00:06:29,832 --> 00:06:31,787
There's more filth here
than in the city sewers.

106
00:06:31,911 --> 00:06:34,584
And I pay good money
for the right info.

107
00:06:34,711 --> 00:06:37,431
Here you go, kid.
Don't hesitate to get in touch.

108
00:06:39,231 --> 00:06:42,222
You must be Robert.
I've been expecting you.

109
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:44,022
Pleased to meet you sir.

110
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:47,108
Just call me Arthur.

111
00:06:47,229 --> 00:06:49,949
Here you don't want that, son.

112
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:55,026
He's a non-good muckraker
from the gutter press.

113
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:56,979
Got nothing better to do
than make up lies...

114
00:06:57,068 --> 00:06:59,947
and nasty stories about the cast.

115
00:07:01,108 --> 00:07:02,063
Ooh!

116
00:07:04,668 --> 00:07:07,579
That's Miss Heidi.
You'll have heard of her.

117
00:07:07,707 --> 00:07:11,461
I certainly have.
She's my favourite star.

118
00:07:14,826 --> 00:07:16,464
Excuse me, girls.

119
00:07:17,226 --> 00:07:19,693
Can I have your attention
for a minute?

120
00:07:19,825 --> 00:07:22,659
I'd like to introduce you all
to a new member of the chorus.

121
00:07:22,785 --> 00:07:26,539
I'm sure you'll do your best to make
him feel a part of the Feeble family.

122
00:07:27,225 --> 00:07:31,377
Come on, say hello Robert.
Don't be bashful.

123
00:07:31,545 --> 00:07:33,102
Oh, isn't he handsome?

124
00:07:33,224 --> 00:07:36,101
What a lovely set of quills!

125
00:07:39,983 --> 00:07:41,780
That's Lucille.

126
00:07:41,904 --> 00:07:44,337
She's just joined the chorus
as well.

127
00:07:44,463 --> 00:07:46,612
You two should get together
sometime.

128
00:07:46,862 --> 00:07:50,172
Is it true that long quills
are a sign of virility?

129
00:07:51,981 --> 00:07:53,654
Now look what you've done!

130
00:07:53,822 --> 00:07:56,494
You've gone and got him
all embarrassed.

131
00:07:57,941 --> 00:08:01,456
Come on Robert old son.
Uncurl, there's a good boy.

132
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,169
I think he fancies you, Lucy.

133
00:08:04,301 --> 00:08:06,530
Yes, it's true love all right.

134
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,890
See the way he looked at you.

135
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:12,375
Stop it!
He's just an old hedgehog!

136
00:08:13,739 --> 00:08:18,766
Get up your knees!
Put your head up!

137
00:08:19,138 --> 00:08:21,333
Don't forget to breath!

138
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:30,567
<i>Funny little sandhopper
basking in the sun...</i>

139
00:08:30,697 --> 00:08:32,927
<i>dancing and a-hopping
having lots of fun.</i>

140
00:08:33,057 --> 00:08:35,286
<i>Bit of sand landed
in that hopper's eye.</i>

141
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:37,725
<i>Little sandhopper said,
"My oh my"...</i>

142
00:08:37,856 --> 00:08:39,335
<i>I get one leg missing...</i>

143
00:08:40,096 --> 00:08:42,052
<i>one leg missing...</i>

144
00:08:42,656 --> 00:08:45,169
<i>I get one leg missing...</i>

145
00:08:45,295 --> 00:08:46,649
<i>How do I get around?</i>

146
00:08:47,335 --> 00:08:49,610
<i>Shiny shiny fishy
in the ocean blue.</i>

147
00:08:49,735 --> 00:08:52,203
<i>Swam into a sewage pipe,
pooh, pooh, pooh.</i>

148
00:08:52,335 --> 00:08:54,484
<i>Said "I'm in the shit,
better take a dive".</i>

149
00:08:54,614 --> 00:08:56,922
<i>Stuck his head out of the water
and began to jive.</i>

150
00:08:57,053 --> 00:08:58,407
<i>I got one leg missing...</i>

151
00:08:59,574 --> 00:09:00,926
<i>one leg missing...</i>

152
00:09:01,893 --> 00:09:04,088
<i>I got one leg missing...</i>

153
00:09:04,653 --> 00:09:05,881
<i>How do I get around?</i>

154
00:09:06,013 --> 00:09:06,967
<i>All right!</i>

155
00:09:15,132 --> 00:09:17,361
What are you doing here,
pincushion?

156
00:09:18,411 --> 00:09:20,925
I was just watching the chorus.

157
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:24,363
- You're the new boy, aren't you?
- Yes, I am.

158
00:09:24,651 --> 00:09:27,722
I just started today.
I'm Robert.

159
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:31,565
You may be Robert to your friends,
but you're fly shit to me.

160
00:09:32,729 --> 00:09:33,957
Piss off!

161
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:35,884
Yes, sir.

162
00:09:37,609 --> 00:09:40,076
Goddamn prickleback!

163
00:09:44,488 --> 00:09:45,887
<i>I got one leg missing...</i>

164
00:09:46,008 --> 00:09:48,124
<i>I got one leg missing...</i>

165
00:09:48,407 --> 00:09:51,366
<i>I got one leg missing.</i>

166
00:09:51,487 --> 00:09:52,556
<i>How do I get around?</i>

167
00:09:52,687 --> 00:09:56,201
That Lucille's got
a cute tush.

168
00:09:56,327 --> 00:10:00,205
I wouldn't mind giving her
a poke with the old pork sword.

169
00:10:00,686 --> 00:10:01,960
<i>I get one leg missing.</i>

170
00:10:02,046 --> 00:10:03,195
<i>How do I get around?</i>

171
00:10:13,005 --> 00:10:16,314
Trevor, please,
I need it, man.

172
00:10:16,724 --> 00:10:18,362
I need it.

173
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:20,553
I told you before,
it's coming.

174
00:10:20,683 --> 00:10:24,278
Yeah, but...
I got the shakes something bad.

175
00:10:24,403 --> 00:10:27,951
If I don't get a fix,
I won't be able to perform.

176
00:10:28,082 --> 00:10:29,914
Listen, it'll be here, all right?

177
00:10:30,043 --> 00:10:31,555
Stop bothering me.

178
00:10:31,762 --> 00:10:33,081
I can pay for it.

179
00:10:33,601 --> 00:10:36,435
Thanks froggy.
This'll cover what you owe me.

180
00:10:36,562 --> 00:10:38,199
But that's all I've got!

181
00:10:38,641 --> 00:10:42,759
Well, you'd better find
another fifty bucks before six.

182
00:10:42,881 --> 00:10:44,872
That's all I've got!

183
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,270
Thank you everybody.

184
00:11:03,398 --> 00:11:05,786
You've all mutilated
that number rather nicely.

185
00:11:06,037 --> 00:11:08,472
We'll have another shot at it
at two thirty...

186
00:11:08,558 --> 00:11:10,468
and perhaps put it out
of its misery.

187
00:11:13,917 --> 00:11:15,986
Excuse me, Mr. Bletch.

188
00:11:16,596 --> 00:11:17,552
Sir...

189
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,951
If I could have a minute
of your time.

190
00:11:20,076 --> 00:11:22,270
I've been waiting to see you
all day.

191
00:11:22,396 --> 00:11:25,546
I've got a smashing little routine
I think will go down a treat.

192
00:11:25,675 --> 00:11:27,871
So, you want to join the Feebles?

193
00:11:27,996 --> 00:11:29,633
Oh, rather!

194
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:33,794
Ok son, I'll give you one minute.
Impress me.

195
00:11:35,554 --> 00:11:37,943
It's one of my own compositions.

196
00:11:38,113 --> 00:11:42,265
It's called:
"Glad to Be a Guppy".

197
00:11:43,914 --> 00:11:47,622
<i>I'm a fishy little fellow
with a scaly sort of skin...</i>

198
00:11:47,753 --> 00:11:50,392
<i>and I frolic in the shadows
when the tide is coming in.</i>

199
00:11:51,592 --> 00:11:53,901
Is something the matter,
Mr. Bletch?

200
00:11:54,032 --> 00:11:57,069
I think I've got a cavity
in a rear molar.

201
00:11:57,192 --> 00:11:59,386
Would you mind
having a look for me?

202
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:00,739
Oh, Certainly.

203
00:12:01,511 --> 00:12:05,059
It's right at the back.

204
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:07,658
Oh, it's awful dark in here!

205
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:16,227
Went down a treat, all right.
Heh, heh!

206
00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:19,067
Hello, Lucille.

207
00:12:20,069 --> 00:12:22,185
You may not remember me.

208
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:24,902
My name is Robert
and I'd just like to say that...

209
00:12:25,108 --> 00:12:27,622
you're the most pretty girl
I've ever met.

210
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:32,138
I was wondering if you would like
to go to the movies tomorrow night.

211
00:12:32,268 --> 00:12:33,666
Those flowers are for you!

212
00:12:35,667 --> 00:12:38,386
Maybe I should give her
the flowers first.

213
00:12:39,546 --> 00:12:43,095
Gorblimey!
The poor little blighter's smitten!

214
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:49,060
Hi, these flowers are for you.
They are white roses.

215
00:12:49,425 --> 00:12:51,017
I hope you like them.

216
00:12:51,185 --> 00:12:53,652
You may not remember me,
but my name is Robert.

217
00:12:53,745 --> 00:12:56,099
I was wondering if you'd like
to go to the movies.

218
00:12:56,224 --> 00:12:59,853
I tried on the lace camisole
and it fitted perfectly.

219
00:13:02,343 --> 00:13:04,334
Hi, my name is...
movies...

220
00:13:04,504 --> 00:13:07,142
I'd like to Robert you with...

221
00:13:07,943 --> 00:13:13,062
Here Rob old son.
Come on in for a cup of tea.

222
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:21,935
When are we due on the course?

223
00:13:22,221 --> 00:13:26,009
One o'clock sharp.
It's all arranged.

224
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,730
How's your handicap, Barry?

225
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:34,858
She's at home baking a cake, boss.

226
00:14:01,496 --> 00:14:02,531
Heavens, Heidi!

227
00:14:02,616 --> 00:14:05,210
You haven't been exercising,
have you?

228
00:14:05,336 --> 00:14:08,532
All that excess flab must put
a terrible strain on your heart.

229
00:14:08,935 --> 00:14:13,133
If you're referring to my muscle tone,
it's never been better.

230
00:14:13,254 --> 00:14:16,053
You must have awful trouble
buying clothes.

231
00:14:16,175 --> 00:14:19,610
Still, at your age I suppose
you might as well let your figure go.

232
00:14:19,854 --> 00:14:23,323
How dare you insult me, you,
you cheap pussy?

233
00:14:24,533 --> 00:14:27,001
You shuddering great herbivore!

234
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:29,283
No wonder Bletch can't stand
the sight of you!

235
00:14:29,412 --> 00:14:31,369
You're lying!
He loves me!

236
00:14:31,493 --> 00:14:33,528
- He detests you!
- That's not true!

237
00:14:33,652 --> 00:14:36,246
You bore him to tears and
you're awful in bed.

238
00:14:37,332 --> 00:14:40,289
It's me he wants.
He can't get enough of me.

239
00:14:40,451 --> 00:14:41,407
Liar!

240
00:14:41,652 --> 00:14:43,323
If you weren't so stupid...

241
00:14:43,491 --> 00:14:46,084
you'd know we've been
having an affair for months.

242
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:51,000
You liar!
You liar!

243
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:53,722
Hey, good one!
You showed her!

244
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,966
Right, Robbie.
Now you got everything I told you.

245
00:15:01,089 --> 00:15:04,922
She's in there now,
so you give it your best shot.

246
00:15:05,408 --> 00:15:08,161
Are you sure that this is a good
idea?

247
00:15:08,288 --> 00:15:11,121
She'll love it.

248
00:15:19,167 --> 00:15:27,323
<i>You are my amour, what I adore.
Oh Lucille!</i>

249
00:15:28,605 --> 00:15:36,842
<i>This is the way that I must say
how my heart feels!</i>

250
00:15:36,965 --> 00:15:41,321
<i>Oh, Lucille!
Oh, Lucille!</i>

251
00:15:41,444 --> 00:15:44,913
<i>Oohh, Luc... ciii!</i>

252
00:15:48,363 --> 00:15:51,753
Keep going, keep going!
It's magic!

253
00:15:56,563 --> 00:15:59,759
<i>Under the light
of the Spanish moon...</i>

254
00:15:59,881 --> 00:16:05,194
<i>it's for love that I croon this tune,
Lucille...</i>

255
00:16:05,321 --> 00:16:07,038
<i>Lucille...</i>

256
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,835
<i>Lucille...</i>

257
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,748
I'm terribly sorry.
You must think I'm an idiot.

258
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,916
I should never have done this.

259
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,716
I promise you,
I shan't ever bother you again.

260
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:26,669
Robert... wait!

261
00:16:27,678 --> 00:16:30,112
How did you know
I love flamenco?

262
00:16:32,477 --> 00:16:37,597
That were beautiful,
just beautiful.

263
00:16:47,876 --> 00:16:49,831
Oh, God!

264
00:16:49,995 --> 00:16:52,031
How did you get in?

265
00:16:53,755 --> 00:16:56,952
Oh, no!
Not the cold cream!

266
00:16:57,075 --> 00:17:02,023
I told you guys before,
stay out of my room!

267
00:17:07,873 --> 00:17:09,431
Stay out!

268
00:17:19,432 --> 00:17:20,784
Flipping heck!

269
00:17:28,471 --> 00:17:32,941
What am I going to do now?

270
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:36,307
It took me six months
to train that lot.

271
00:17:43,308 --> 00:17:46,584
Not a bad little meat pattie.

272
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:55,626
Good shot, boss!

273
00:17:57,787 --> 00:17:59,777
Your shot, Cedric!

274
00:18:16,104 --> 00:18:18,539
O thought I told you
to wipe my clubs.

275
00:18:25,463 --> 00:18:28,183
Take that you bastard!

276
00:18:36,662 --> 00:18:37,617
Shit!

277
00:18:39,542 --> 00:18:42,214
I'm on form today!

278
00:18:43,662 --> 00:18:45,458
It's a lovely course.

279
00:18:45,621 --> 00:18:48,180
I'm tempted to join
the club myself.

280
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,656
No chance of that,
I'm afraid, Cedric.

281
00:18:50,821 --> 00:18:53,175
You mean they discriminate
against Scots?

282
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:56,412
No, we just don't like assholes
in the clubhouse.

283
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:01,331
Sid, it's really decent of you
to have me in for a lager...

284
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:05,369
after today's little mishap.

285
00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:08,338
No hard feelings Arthur.

286
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:10,370
It's just my bad luck.

287
00:19:10,658 --> 00:19:13,377
This sort of thing is
always happening to me.

288
00:19:13,937 --> 00:19:17,486
Did I tell you Sanyd's slapping
a paternity suit on me?

289
00:19:17,617 --> 00:19:18,572
Is that right?

290
00:19:18,737 --> 00:19:22,252
Yeah, she reckons that kid
she dropped is mine.

291
00:19:22,377 --> 00:19:24,207
I'd like to see her prove it, though.

292
00:19:24,336 --> 00:19:26,407
She's slept with half the chorus.

293
00:19:26,537 --> 00:19:27,651
Has he?

294
00:19:28,136 --> 00:19:29,966
She hasn't slept with me.

295
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:33,492
Oh, no.
I wasn't suggesting anything.

296
00:19:33,615 --> 00:19:38,086
Like you're a mate, Arthur.
I know I can trust you.

297
00:19:38,535 --> 00:19:41,651
Oh, Christ,
here she comes now.

298
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:51,282
Sidney, the date's been
set down as the 16th.

299
00:19:51,373 --> 00:19:54,888
If you don't appear in court,
it'll be held over until the 21st...

300
00:19:55,013 --> 00:19:58,642
at which time you'll be compelled
to provide a blood sample.

301
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:03,160
Sandy, why did you bring it here?
It's not mine!

302
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:05,646
You know it's not!

303
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:08,887
We'll let the court decide that,
shall we?

304
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:20,484
It's got your eyes, Sid.

305
00:20:47,686 --> 00:20:51,234
<i>You want a slice of the action
but you're not acting...</i>

306
00:20:52,926 --> 00:20:57,440
<i>You want a slice of the action
but you don't want to pay the price...</i>

307
00:20:58,605 --> 00:21:03,395
<i>You're going to end up in traction
if you don't take my advice.</i>

308
00:21:03,525 --> 00:21:05,992
<i>You want a piece of the pie...</i>

309
00:21:06,124 --> 00:21:08,159
<i>but you don't want
to share with me...</i>

310
00:21:09,884 --> 00:21:11,601
<i>You want a piece of that pie...</i>

311
00:21:11,723 --> 00:21:13,998
<i>but you'll never get
nothing for free.</i>

312
00:21:15,323 --> 00:21:17,233
<i>You better watch what you say...</i>

313
00:21:17,362 --> 00:21:19,479
<i>'cause that ain't my recipe.</i>

314
00:21:20,762 --> 00:21:23,229
<i>I'm hip to your lip...</i>

315
00:21:23,401 --> 00:21:24,835
<i>you'll see...</i>

316
00:21:26,242 --> 00:21:29,916
<i>You're just a low-down snake
with a two-time repartee.</i>

317
00:21:32,201 --> 00:21:36,273
<i>I'm hip to your jive,
but it don't sound hip to me.</i>

318
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:42,478
Say, who is that dame?

319
00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:46,354
That's Heidi.
Ain't she something?

320
00:21:46,479 --> 00:21:51,108
She's only been here a week
and already she's packing the joint.

321
00:21:51,238 --> 00:21:53,354
With a voice like that
she's going to go places!

322
00:21:54,198 --> 00:21:57,827
<i>You want a hot potato,
but baby you're just too cold.</i>

323
00:21:59,557 --> 00:22:03,436
<i>You want a hot potato
to go with your sausage roll.</i>

324
00:22:04,997 --> 00:22:08,591
<i>Don't look at me baby,
I'm much too hot to hold.</i>

325
00:22:10,476 --> 00:22:13,274
<i>I'm hip to your lip...</i>

326
00:22:13,396 --> 00:22:14,545
<i>you'll see...</i>

327
00:22:16,075 --> 00:22:17,827
Yeah!

328
00:22:19,515 --> 00:22:21,345
Thank you!

329
00:22:22,914 --> 00:22:26,065
From the gentleman
with the red carnation.

330
00:22:28,473 --> 00:22:30,544
So, you're from the East?

331
00:22:30,674 --> 00:22:33,141
I hear they've got some
great swamps out that way.

332
00:22:33,273 --> 00:22:36,390
What's a cute young think like you
doing in the big smoke?

333
00:22:36,753 --> 00:22:40,268
I'm not so young.
In two years I'll be eighteen.

334
00:22:40,353 --> 00:22:43,071
Really?
But you're so well developed...

335
00:22:43,752 --> 00:22:45,504
Vocally, I mean.

336
00:22:45,632 --> 00:22:48,623
My singing teachers said
I've enormous lung power.

337
00:22:48,751 --> 00:22:51,345
I like your style, Heidi.

338
00:22:51,791 --> 00:22:54,384
- Really?
- You've got a lot of class.

339
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:56,342
But that sometimes ain't enough.

340
00:22:56,471 --> 00:22:59,189
I seen a lot of girls like you
ruined in this town.

341
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:01,346
You need to make
the right connections,,,

342
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:02,983
and that's where I can help.

343
00:23:04,829 --> 00:23:06,421
Are you a producer?

344
00:23:06,548 --> 00:23:11,099
I am to be the best goddam producer
this town has ever seen.

345
00:23:11,228 --> 00:23:13,344
I got the contacts,
I got the capital...

346
00:23:13,468 --> 00:23:15,857
what I need is what you got:

347
00:23:15,988 --> 00:23:17,467
Talent!

348
00:23:17,788 --> 00:23:21,382
Heidi, I want to manage you.

349
00:23:22,767 --> 00:23:23,836
But...

350
00:23:24,287 --> 00:23:26,595
I don't even know who you are!

351
00:23:26,766 --> 00:23:29,997
They call me Bletch!

352
00:23:31,286 --> 00:23:35,802
Bletch!
What a lovely name!

353
00:23:36,765 --> 00:23:38,483
Tell me Heidi...

354
00:23:38,605 --> 00:23:42,484
do those lips kiss as good
as they sing?

355
00:23:47,324 --> 00:23:48,723
Bletch!

356
00:24:04,482 --> 00:24:06,757
Very nice, Mr. Bletch.

357
00:24:06,882 --> 00:24:10,669
Perhaps you'd like to inspect
my range of clubs.

358
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,639
It's good gear,
I can assure you.

359
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,478
O that I have no doubts.

360
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:26,112
It's good stuff boss.

361
00:24:26,959 --> 00:24:28,597
When can we expect delivery?

362
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:31,670
Meet Louie in the alleyway
at six.

363
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:44,230
Sorry.
A touch of the ptomaine.

364
00:24:51,316 --> 00:24:54,706
It must be all this fresh air.
It gives me hay fever.

365
00:24:59,035 --> 00:25:01,549
Bad luck old chap!

366
00:25:10,834 --> 00:25:12,153
What the?

367
00:25:13,113 --> 00:25:14,546
My apologies Cedric!

368
00:25:14,673 --> 00:25:16,823
I had a bone stuck in my throat.

369
00:25:17,353 --> 00:25:19,230
My game, I think.

370
00:25:19,552 --> 00:25:20,746
Shit!

371
00:25:21,032 --> 00:25:28,746
Did I pass the audition,
Mr. Bletch?

372
00:25:30,791 --> 00:25:35,182
Oh, harder Harry, oh!

373
00:25:35,311 --> 00:25:37,586
Oh, yes, yes, oh!

374
00:25:37,711 --> 00:25:38,826
Harry!

375
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:43,986
All those carrots
make me good in the dark.

376
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:46,623
But it feels so good!

377
00:25:46,789 --> 00:25:49,667
They don't call it "bunnylingus"
for nothing, sweetheart.

378
00:25:49,789 --> 00:25:52,461
What about me?
Are you going to service me too?

379
00:25:52,588 --> 00:25:55,148
Sure, climb on up and
I'll give you a valve grind.

380
00:25:56,788 --> 00:25:58,938
Hey!
Hold on a moment!

381
00:25:59,268 --> 00:26:00,781
What's going on?
I can't see.

382
00:26:03,027 --> 00:26:04,427
Goddamn pervert!

383
00:26:04,548 --> 00:26:05,741
Who was it, Harry?

384
00:26:05,867 --> 00:26:08,334
Just a little creep
with a bad case of jizm pressure.

385
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:10,742
How's your jizm pressure,
Harry?

386
00:26:10,867 --> 00:26:12,936
I can feel it coming on.

387
00:26:13,066 --> 00:26:16,297
Oh, boy,
it's going to be a gusher!

388
00:26:21,265 --> 00:26:23,825
Oh, no!

389
00:26:23,985 --> 00:26:28,136
No, no!

390
00:26:31,264 --> 00:26:33,902
No, help!

391
00:26:34,103 --> 00:26:35,456
Take that!

392
00:26:37,503 --> 00:26:39,812
Oh, no!

393
00:26:40,582 --> 00:26:42,653
Take that, you bitch!

394
00:26:43,263 --> 00:26:46,776
I beg you, please now stop it!

395
00:26:46,901 --> 00:26:48,620
Call me "sir", slut!

396
00:26:48,742 --> 00:26:49,697
Ow!

397
00:26:49,822 --> 00:26:55,054
Leave her alone!
Are you all right, madam?

398
00:26:55,181 --> 00:26:57,740
Cut!

399
00:26:58,581 --> 00:26:59,979
Jesus Christ!

400
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:03,888
You've a nasty habit of sticking
your nose in where it's not wanted.

401
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,056
I'm sorry.

402
00:27:06,179 --> 00:27:09,410
You ruined my take, kid.
I never do two takes!

403
00:27:09,899 --> 00:27:12,015
I didn't know it was a film.

404
00:27:12,219 --> 00:27:14,414
Hurry it up,
I'm freezing!

405
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:18,686
I'm sorry for interrupting.
I won't disturb you any longer.

406
00:27:19,378 --> 00:27:21,448
We'll skip the whipping.

407
00:27:21,538 --> 00:27:22,856
Let's move on to the blowjob.

408
00:27:22,977 --> 00:27:25,696
Where's the Masked Masochist?

409
00:27:26,417 --> 00:27:28,805
Oh Christ that's all I need!

410
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:29,965
He's carked!

411
00:27:30,096 --> 00:27:33,168
Didn't you realise
you were sitting on his face?

412
00:27:33,376 --> 00:27:37,164
I felt a bit uncomfortable, but
I thought it was my haemorrhoids.

413
00:27:37,296 --> 00:27:40,651
What the hell, maybe I can sell it
as a snuff movie.

414
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:51,125
You'll have to find a substitute.

415
00:27:51,254 --> 00:27:53,051
I don't do self abuse.

416
00:27:54,374 --> 00:27:58,764
No sorries, Daisy.
I know just the guy.

417
00:28:15,931 --> 00:28:19,844
What do you know!
It's Dennis on a smelly minge binge.

418
00:28:19,971 --> 00:28:23,360
Oh gosh! I was just looking
for the soap powder.

419
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:26,368
Sure, Dennis.
Have a whiff of these.

420
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:29,766
They've got
a real distinctive bouquet.

421
00:28:32,649 --> 00:28:35,288
Dennis,
we've got a little job for you.

422
00:29:16,883 --> 00:29:20,319
Oh my god!
Next!

423
00:29:34,042 --> 00:29:36,316
All right everybody,
from the top!

424
00:29:36,401 --> 00:29:37,436
Music, please!

425
00:30:21,195 --> 00:30:22,150
For Chrissake!

426
00:30:22,276 --> 00:30:25,267
What the hell was wrong
with that?

427
00:30:25,395 --> 00:30:28,467
Who is holding
that red pennant?

428
00:30:31,554 --> 00:30:32,703
Me sir.

429
00:30:32,834 --> 00:30:35,553
And what on earth do you think
you're doing?

430
00:30:35,674 --> 00:30:37,629
I'm patrolling the moat, sir.

431
00:30:37,793 --> 00:30:40,785
Patrolling the moat?
I see.

432
00:30:41,313 --> 00:30:45,067
You were instructed to stay
upstage left.

433
00:30:45,233 --> 00:30:48,508
Italian pennant bearers of
the XVll century were frequently...

434
00:30:48,632 --> 00:30:52,385
known to patrol the rampart
on the lookout for Turkish invaders.

435
00:30:52,511 --> 00:30:54,422
How very elucidating.

436
00:30:54,632 --> 00:30:56,508
I've been reading up on it, sir.

437
00:30:56,631 --> 00:30:58,349
My drama teacher at school
said...

438
00:30:58,431 --> 00:31:00,706
I should always research
a role thoroughly.

439
00:31:00,831 --> 00:31:03,025
Really?
Let me tell you something.

440
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:05,664
This is a television variety show...

441
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:08,304
not a homage to Soviet Realism!

442
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:10,660
I asked for a pennant,
not a pedant!

443
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:13,059
All right, again!
From the top!

444
00:31:23,228 --> 00:31:24,217
Excuse me!

445
00:31:24,588 --> 00:31:25,576
Stop!

446
00:31:25,707 --> 00:31:26,743
Shit!

447
00:31:26,868 --> 00:31:28,061
Oh, God!

448
00:31:28,187 --> 00:31:29,176
What is it?

449
00:31:29,747 --> 00:31:33,706
It's just I'm having trouble
with my motivation.

450
00:31:34,307 --> 00:31:36,774
I don't understand
why I would remain still...

451
00:31:36,866 --> 00:31:40,142
when the scene itself suggests
vigorous physical action...

452
00:31:40,426 --> 00:31:41,574
danger even.

453
00:31:41,705 --> 00:31:44,583
I suppose you'd like everyone
to stop singing...

454
00:31:44,785 --> 00:31:47,981
while you come forward to do
a little war dance centre stage.

455
00:31:48,104 --> 00:31:49,060
Is that it?

456
00:31:49,185 --> 00:31:50,981
Well, it had crossed my mind!

457
00:31:51,104 --> 00:31:52,457
My god!

458
00:31:52,584 --> 00:31:55,098
Sorry guy, I hate to interrupt,
but I don't think...

459
00:31:55,184 --> 00:31:57,981
the knife thrower's assistant
is going to pull through.

460
00:31:58,383 --> 00:32:00,738
Shall I cancel Winyard's act
entirely?

461
00:32:01,023 --> 00:32:02,581
I think not.

462
00:32:02,863 --> 00:32:05,536
I've got just the substitute.

463
00:32:10,742 --> 00:32:13,301
"Dennis Does Daisy!
Take 1.

464
00:32:13,421 --> 00:32:15,174
Dennis, drop your strides.

465
00:32:16,661 --> 00:32:18,777
Come on, come on,
the camera's rolling.

466
00:32:18,901 --> 00:32:20,698
Oh for Chrissake!

467
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,697
Is that the best you can do?

468
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:27,458
Trevor do something about this guy!

469
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,899
Come on, get aroused!

470
00:32:29,579 --> 00:32:30,534
I can't.

471
00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:33,457
Well, I'm not doing anything
until he cracks a fat.

472
00:32:33,579 --> 00:32:35,695
What's the matter?
Doesn't she turn you on?

473
00:32:36,739 --> 00:32:40,174
Here you go.
Will these help?

474
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:43,018
Oh god, not another panty-sniffer!

475
00:32:43,138 --> 00:32:45,651
He's going to want me
to piss in his mouth next.

476
00:32:45,777 --> 00:32:47,416
Ok kid, do your stuff.

477
00:32:48,737 --> 00:32:51,570
Oh yes!
Yes! ¡

478
00:32:52,176 --> 00:32:55,089
Oh, God!
It's terrible!

479
00:32:55,216 --> 00:32:58,129
I feel terrible!
What's happening to me?

480
00:32:58,257 --> 00:33:01,009
What's the matter, Harry?
Not feeling too well?

481
00:33:01,496 --> 00:33:03,406
What?
Who said that?

482
00:33:03,576 --> 00:33:05,293
It's all those last nights.

483
00:33:05,375 --> 00:33:08,048
Maybe you're not getting
enough vitamins.

484
00:33:10,295 --> 00:33:12,524
Care to join me for lunch?

485
00:33:16,974 --> 00:33:21,091
Hmm, carrots!
It's not one of yours, is it Harry?

486
00:33:21,293 --> 00:33:22,726
You are sick!

487
00:33:22,853 --> 00:33:25,162
No, Harry.
I think you are.

488
00:33:25,333 --> 00:33:27,289
Give me the rundown
on your symptoms.

489
00:33:27,413 --> 00:33:31,166
I ain't got nothing,
you shit-eating journo.

490
00:33:31,292 --> 00:33:34,408
You can't suppress the media,
Harry.

491
00:33:37,092 --> 00:33:40,799
Come on, you can tell me,
I'll be very discreet.

492
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:43,888
I'm as fit as a fiddle.
I feel fantastic.

493
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:45,921
And I'm sick and tired of your...

494
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:47,199
Hold it right there!

495
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:49,321
"I'm tired and I'm sick",
says Harry...

496
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:51,877
the Hare star of
the Feebles Variety Hour.

497
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:54,399
Sounds like the germs
of a good story.

498
00:33:54,569 --> 00:33:56,604
Leave me alone!

499
00:33:56,728 --> 00:33:58,208
You can't hide the truth.

500
00:33:58,329 --> 00:34:01,400
Whatever you've got, I'll find it out
or I'll make it up.

501
00:34:06,008 --> 00:34:09,125
This is going to be a great scoop!

502
00:34:12,407 --> 00:34:15,205
Jesus Trevor,
have you got the stuff?

503
00:34:15,327 --> 00:34:16,884
I'm hanging out, man.

504
00:34:17,046 --> 00:34:19,719
I'll get you the money tomorrow,
I promise.

505
00:34:19,886 --> 00:34:22,002
Hello, my name's Robert.

506
00:34:22,166 --> 00:34:25,397
- Are you the new supplier?
- I've been sent by the director...

507
00:34:25,526 --> 00:34:27,959
to assist you in your
knife-throwing routine.

508
00:34:29,244 --> 00:34:31,884
- Oh, shit!
- I wondered if you'd like to practice.

509
00:34:32,085 --> 00:34:35,316
No, I don't know, man,
I really don't know.

510
00:34:35,444 --> 00:34:38,004
It's not such a hot idea.

511
00:34:39,083 --> 00:34:41,995
- Have you got any smack?
- Smack?

512
00:34:42,123 --> 00:34:44,842
Horse, liquid sky,
skag...

513
00:34:44,963 --> 00:34:47,761
snow, coke, crack,
methadone...

514
00:34:47,883 --> 00:34:49,201
benzedrine, pinkies, San Ped...

515
00:34:49,362 --> 00:34:51,240
Morning Glory, nutmeg,
blue meanies...

516
00:34:51,323 --> 00:34:53,677
aspirin, Ados, paracetamol...

517
00:34:54,202 --> 00:34:56,112
Vicks Vapour Rub?

518
00:34:58,481 --> 00:35:01,711
Oh, you don't happen to be
an asthmatic by any chance?

519
00:35:02,881 --> 00:35:04,996
Could I borrow your huffer?

520
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,269
I don't take drugs of any sort.

521
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,039
I don't believe it's right
to abuse your body like that.

522
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,627
Oh, that's easy for you to say.

523
00:35:12,039 --> 00:35:14,314
You haven't been to hell and back.

524
00:35:14,439 --> 00:35:15,997
- Eh?
- Nam!

525
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:19,748
- You've been to Vietnam?
- I saw the worst of it, kid.

526
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:26,988
Tet Offensive 1968.

527
00:35:27,757 --> 00:35:30,317
Charlie had our backs
against the wall!

528
00:35:30,597 --> 00:35:32,667
There were six of us.

529
00:35:32,877 --> 00:35:34,595
No, there were five of us.

530
00:35:36,557 --> 00:35:41,346
Every gook north of Saigon
was drawing a bead on us.

531
00:35:58,514 --> 00:36:01,153
Winyard!
Cover me!

532
00:36:01,274 --> 00:36:03,628
Jim! ¡Jim!

533
00:36:16,831 --> 00:36:18,787
Thanks Jim, I owe you one!

534
00:36:18,911 --> 00:36:22,380
I wasn't about to see my best buddy
peppered with Charlie's lead.

535
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:29,021
Three weeks later...

536
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:32,778
we were on a routine patrol
north of Tai Pang.

537
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:35,299
Charlie was close...

538
00:36:35,509 --> 00:36:39,468
so close
you could almost smell him.

539
00:36:51,587 --> 00:36:52,986
Where's Eightball?

540
00:36:53,347 --> 00:36:54,905
We better go back and look for him.

541
00:37:04,665 --> 00:37:06,463
Eightball!
Thank God!

542
00:37:06,586 --> 00:37:09,179
We thought the gooks
had got you, Eightball.

543
00:37:13,145 --> 00:37:16,774
Drop your weapons and put your hands up
revisionist running dogs.

544
00:37:24,303 --> 00:37:27,739
In the days that followed
I wished a thousand times...

545
00:37:27,863 --> 00:37:31,138
that it was my head
on that stake.

546
00:37:31,262 --> 00:37:36,131
Re-education time
for fascist imperialists.

547
00:37:39,581 --> 00:37:41,173
You... read...

548
00:37:41,901 --> 00:37:43,857
You... read.

549
00:37:44,861 --> 00:37:48,091
I can't see, you bastards!

550
00:37:59,299 --> 00:38:02,177
We didn't see Chuck for two days.

551
00:38:02,298 --> 00:38:04,254
We thought he was a goner.

552
00:38:04,458 --> 00:38:08,212
But then on the third night
they brought him back to us.

553
00:38:13,297 --> 00:38:16,687
The bastards had taken his legs.

554
00:38:19,856 --> 00:38:23,007
I still say that private enterprise...

555
00:38:23,136 --> 00:38:26,093
is acceptable
at a village level...

556
00:38:26,216 --> 00:38:29,366
providing it is strictly controlled
by the party.

557
00:38:30,135 --> 00:38:35,003
We must not let petty
bourgeois aspirations...

558
00:38:35,134 --> 00:38:38,206
taint socialist pedagogy.

559
00:38:38,654 --> 00:38:42,966
Reform is the enemy
of revolution.

560
00:38:45,493 --> 00:38:49,168
The one hadn't finished with us yet.

561
00:38:49,293 --> 00:38:53,730
Their twisted communist minds
had devised one last torture.

562
00:39:29,288 --> 00:39:31,802
As I stared down
the muzzle of that gun...

563
00:39:31,928 --> 00:39:34,600
I thought of Chuck and Eightball...

564
00:39:34,767 --> 00:39:37,076
and the thousands of others
who had perished...

565
00:39:37,207 --> 00:39:40,516
in that godforsaken wilderness.

566
00:39:41,447 --> 00:39:44,006
I was not afraid to join them.

567
00:39:56,004 --> 00:39:57,483
Let's go out of here1

568
00:40:09,163 --> 00:40:10,198
Help me!

569
00:40:13,883 --> 00:40:15,952
Come on buddy, help me up!

570
00:40:17,522 --> 00:40:20,639
Winyard! Winyard!
Don't leave me!

571
00:40:20,762 --> 00:40:22,831
Please!
Dear god-no!

572
00:40:37,399 --> 00:40:41,358
It was six months before
I got out that Saigon hospital.

573
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:46,035
By then I was hooked
on every barbiturate known to man.

574
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:48,388
Gosh!
What an awful time you've had!

575
00:40:48,518 --> 00:40:49,746
Hey kid...

576
00:40:49,878 --> 00:40:54,189
you want to express your sympathy
in some kind of material away?

577
00:40:54,437 --> 00:40:55,836
How can I do that?

578
00:40:55,957 --> 00:40:57,788
Vietnam Vets Association.

579
00:40:58,437 --> 00:41:01,030
We're badly under-funded.

580
00:41:05,836 --> 00:41:08,828
Minimum donation fifty bucks.

581
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:13,914
Thanks, kid.

582
00:41:14,115 --> 00:41:16,628
The Association was in bad need...

583
00:41:16,754 --> 00:41:18,825
of a cash injection.

584
00:41:23,554 --> 00:41:26,909
Ooh! Ooh!
What an organ!

585
00:41:32,752 --> 00:41:36,745
Do you really think people
are interested in nasal sex?

586
00:41:36,872 --> 00:41:39,864
Sure boss.
It's the latest fad.

587
00:41:39,992 --> 00:41:41,141
You got a title?

588
00:41:41,272 --> 00:41:44,263
I thought:
"Dennis Does Daisy".

589
00:41:44,391 --> 00:41:45,949
Nah, that's lousy.

590
00:41:46,071 --> 00:41:49,107
Well how about:

591
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:51,544
"Anal Antics"?

592
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:52,989
Not bad.

593
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:54,748
It's got a certain ring to it.

594
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:57,668
It'll appeal to the intellectuals.

595
00:41:57,910 --> 00:42:00,298
Do you think it'll do as well as
our last release...

596
00:42:00,429 --> 00:42:02,181
and win the Hooker Prize?

597
00:42:04,509 --> 00:42:07,148
You know I'm worried
about Madame Bovine.

598
00:42:07,269 --> 00:42:09,782
We've lost money on
hr last two pictures.

599
00:42:09,908 --> 00:42:12,138
You want her replaced, boss?

600
00:42:12,268 --> 00:42:15,100
I think the public are tired
of big udders.

601
00:42:15,227 --> 00:42:17,980
Find someone young and petite.

602
00:42:21,466 --> 00:42:24,219
Sure thing, boss.

603
00:42:25,786 --> 00:42:27,298
Bring on the next act!

604
00:42:27,665 --> 00:42:30,180
It's the contortionist,
Arbee Bargwan.

605
00:42:30,306 --> 00:42:32,944
I told him he wasn't needed
for half an hour.

606
00:42:33,065 --> 00:42:34,623
He'll be meditating.

607
00:42:34,745 --> 00:42:37,338
Well you'll just have
to interrupt him, won't you?

608
00:42:38,384 --> 00:42:41,103
Never mind.
I'll get him myself.

609
00:42:47,063 --> 00:42:50,772
Arbee darling,
I hate to intrude upon nirvana...

610
00:42:50,903 --> 00:42:52,734
but you're needed on stage.

611
00:42:53,023 --> 00:42:57,174
Please don't interrupt me.
I am travelling on the astral plane.

612
00:42:58,942 --> 00:43:01,536
Perhaps you could change
your flight plan...

613
00:43:01,622 --> 00:43:04,215
and grace us mere mortals
with your presence.

614
00:43:04,341 --> 00:43:06,809
I'm impervious to your cynicism.

615
00:43:06,941 --> 00:43:09,659
Listen to me,
you double-jointed freak!

616
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:12,170
If you're not on stage
in five minutes...

617
00:43:12,301 --> 00:43:15,769
you can consider yourself permanently
disembodied from the show.

618
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:17,808
Hey!

619
00:43:46,376 --> 00:43:49,095
Oh good gracious, Harry!

620
00:43:49,296 --> 00:43:51,570
Somebody call a doctor!

621
00:43:52,055 --> 00:43:54,126
How are we feeling, Harry?

622
00:43:54,575 --> 00:43:58,726
I feel real bad, Doc.
What have I got.

623
00:43:58,854 --> 00:44:02,403
I'll do some tests,
but I don't hold out much hope.

624
00:44:02,534 --> 00:44:05,765
There's only one disease
that fits these symptoms.

625
00:44:05,894 --> 00:44:07,531
It's the big one, Harry.

626
00:44:07,653 --> 00:44:09,450
No!
Not the big one!

627
00:44:09,573 --> 00:44:12,041
I'll have to notify
the health authorities.

628
00:44:12,173 --> 00:44:14,288
They'll want a list of
your sexual partners...

629
00:44:14,372 --> 00:44:17,012
for the last twelve months.

630
00:44:17,132 --> 00:44:19,248
It can't be true!
It can't be!

631
00:44:19,412 --> 00:44:21,323
I've taken precautions!

632
00:44:22,132 --> 00:44:24,691
Ah, tell me Doc...

633
00:44:24,771 --> 00:44:26,966
how long have I got?

634
00:44:27,091 --> 00:44:28,763
It's difficult to tell...

635
00:44:28,971 --> 00:44:31,404
but with a case
as advanced as yours...

636
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:33,805
ten,
maybe twelve...

637
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:36,080
- Months?
- Hours.

638
00:44:36,609 --> 00:44:38,202
I'm sorry, Harry.

639
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:41,926
Doc, can you do me
one favour

640
00:44:42,049 --> 00:44:44,404
Sure Harry, shoot.

641
00:44:44,529 --> 00:44:48,727
Don't tell anyone.
Let me do the show tonight.

642
00:44:48,849 --> 00:44:50,327
OK Harry.

643
00:44:50,528 --> 00:44:54,760
I want to go out
with my reputation intact.

644
00:44:56,927 --> 00:44:59,236
Fat chance Harry!

645
00:45:00,967 --> 00:45:03,639
All right then Arbee,
thrill me!

646
00:45:11,286 --> 00:45:12,877
Hippy shit!

647
00:45:36,483 --> 00:45:41,191
Sorry Guv.
Should I start again?

648
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:43,199
Move on, move on.

649
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:06,598
Oh dear!

650
00:46:07,478 --> 00:46:09,231
Are you all right up there?

651
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:12,987
I seem to have stuck
my head up rectum.

652
00:46:16,198 --> 00:46:19,508
You mean it's not part of your act?
Pity.

653
00:46:19,638 --> 00:46:21,946
We could call it:
"Passage to India".

654
00:46:22,757 --> 00:46:24,793
Come on, come on, uncontort!

655
00:46:25,277 --> 00:46:27,107
Somebody help him!

656
00:46:27,236 --> 00:46:30,228
It's no good Guv,
he's stuck fast.

657
00:46:31,516 --> 00:46:35,475
I am in need of assistance here,
please.

658
00:46:35,676 --> 00:46:39,508
Oh god, this is it!
This is the last straw!

659
00:46:48,594 --> 00:46:49,662
Bletch!

660
00:46:49,993 --> 00:46:51,267
We've got to talk!

661
00:46:51,914 --> 00:46:53,471
We've got a crisis on our hands!

662
00:46:54,153 --> 00:46:56,222
Winyard's killed his assistant.

663
00:46:56,352 --> 00:46:57,672
Arbee's out of action...

664
00:46:57,793 --> 00:47:00,352
Sid's routine is
a complete write-off!!

665
00:47:00,632 --> 00:47:04,545
We've got no alternative but
to reinstate my song!

666
00:47:04,672 --> 00:47:05,626
No!

667
00:47:05,711 --> 00:47:06,780
Bletch, I'm sorry...

668
00:47:06,911 --> 00:47:09,266
but the show is
in a shambles!

669
00:47:09,391 --> 00:47:11,507
This is a family show,
for Chrissake!

670
00:47:11,591 --> 00:47:13,547
The network would never allow it.

671
00:47:13,671 --> 00:47:15,979
But it's a superb piece of song
and dance...

672
00:47:16,070 --> 00:47:18,378
It'll go down fabulously
with the public.

673
00:47:18,550 --> 00:47:20,745
I demand it be included!

674
00:47:21,110 --> 00:47:24,624
Keep your filthy paws
off my furniture!

675
00:47:25,389 --> 00:47:27,380
We've got a wonderful new
interpretation.

676
00:47:27,509 --> 00:47:30,342
It sort of goes like this.
Watch.

677
00:47:31,308 --> 00:47:33,583
The chorus come sin stage left...

678
00:47:34,668 --> 00:47:37,625
and there's a lovely little bit
with a piano...

679
00:47:37,827 --> 00:47:40,262
and that's where I come in
from upstage.

680
00:47:40,388 --> 00:47:42,059
And I sort of pirouette...

681
00:47:42,187 --> 00:47:44,461
and the strings are swirling
around me...

682
00:47:44,546 --> 00:47:45,900
and if you can imagine...

683
00:47:46,027 --> 00:47:48,904
and the cellos re coming in
and it's just...

684
00:47:49,946 --> 00:47:52,255
And I leap across la la!

685
00:47:53,945 --> 00:47:57,301
I say, Bletch,
put me down!

686
00:47:58,425 --> 00:48:01,815
I've had just about enough
of your goddamn compositions.

687
00:48:02,105 --> 00:48:06,063
Now get back on the stage
and do your job!

688
00:48:08,864 --> 00:48:11,457
It's your loss, Philistine!

689
00:48:11,743 --> 00:48:12,733
Faggot!

690
00:48:22,182 --> 00:48:27,209
Good morning, Frau Heidi!
What will it be today?

691
00:48:28,942 --> 00:48:31,375
Just one of those tiny truffles,
please.

692
00:48:34,381 --> 00:48:36,291
This one...

693
00:49:15,295 --> 00:49:17,412
Will that be all, Frau Heidi?

694
00:49:17,536 --> 00:49:19,207
Something to take away, maybe?

695
00:49:21,854 --> 00:49:23,686
The black forest cherry cake?

696
00:49:30,134 --> 00:49:34,126
Hi Harry!
Just doing a bit of undercover work.

697
00:49:34,253 --> 00:49:36,721
Heh!
That rash on your groin...

698
00:49:36,813 --> 00:49:38,006
Iooks pretty ugly...

699
00:49:38,132 --> 00:49:40,600
and don't taste too good neither.

700
00:49:40,892 --> 00:49:43,486
Get out of my bed, you parasite!

701
00:49:43,612 --> 00:49:46,126
Hold it right here, Harry.
That's great!

702
00:49:49,652 --> 00:49:51,721
Me nuts!

703
00:49:54,731 --> 00:49:57,290
I was sorry to hear
about your fatal disease.

704
00:49:57,410 --> 00:49:58,763
Do you have any comments?

705
00:49:58,890 --> 00:50:00,209
It's a slander,
it's libel!

706
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:02,525
I have no fatal disease!
I'm perfectly healthy!

707
00:50:04,809 --> 00:50:08,245
Let me just see what
Dr. Quack had to say.

708
00:50:08,369 --> 00:50:09,358
Quote:

709
00:50:10,729 --> 00:50:13,640
"There's only one disease
that fits these symptoms.

710
00:50:13,928 --> 00:50:15,646
It's the big one, Harry."

711
00:50:15,728 --> 00:50:16,843
Unquote.

712
00:50:18,848 --> 00:50:20,519
Move your hand away.

713
00:50:20,647 --> 00:50:22,797
I want some shots of real tears.

714
00:50:22,927 --> 00:50:24,724
Want do you want from me?
Money?

715
00:50:24,847 --> 00:50:27,042
I'll pay you anything.

716
00:50:27,167 --> 00:50:28,282
Sorry, Harry.

717
00:50:28,407 --> 00:50:30,874
You could never pay me
what this story's worth.

718
00:50:31,406 --> 00:50:32,759
Wait! Wait!

719
00:50:32,886 --> 00:50:35,274
I'll give you
my life insurance policy.

720
00:50:35,405 --> 00:50:37,715
Life insurance?
Now you're talking.

721
00:50:37,846 --> 00:50:40,882
Come over here,
I'll sign it over to you.

722
00:50:41,005 --> 00:50:43,838
Great, I'll be able to cash it
in this time tomorrow.

723
00:50:45,884 --> 00:50:47,317
Nice try, Harry!

724
00:50:47,444 --> 00:50:49,799
I've got to go, we both
have deadlines to meet.

725
00:50:49,924 --> 00:50:52,278
Get it, Harry?
"Deadline".

726
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:55,397
That's not a bad one.
Stop press!

727
00:50:55,523 --> 00:50:58,082
Hold the front page!
I got an exclusive!

728
00:51:08,121 --> 00:51:11,636
Here!
You stuck it in the wrong way round!

729
00:51:12,121 --> 00:51:16,034
I'm sorry.
I didn't know worms had nerves.

730
00:51:16,161 --> 00:51:19,709
Since the nightmare of Vietnam
he's been a hopeless drug addict.

731
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:23,350
It made me realise
just how lucky I am.

732
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:26,278
How lucky we both are!

733
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:31,638
I'm so glad we decided
to get engaged.

734
00:51:32,719 --> 00:51:34,515
Good luck for tonight, Lucy.

735
00:51:34,638 --> 00:51:36,674
- Are you nervous?
- Just a bit.

736
00:51:36,798 --> 00:51:37,867
Me too.

737
00:51:38,238 --> 00:51:40,512
Actually I'm terribly nervous.

738
00:51:41,037 --> 00:51:42,357
This is my first show.

739
00:51:42,438 --> 00:51:45,235
You'll be wonderful.
I know you will.

740
00:52:00,515 --> 00:52:02,630
I hope I'm not interrupting.

741
00:52:02,754 --> 00:52:05,030
I was just dressing
for the show.

742
00:52:05,155 --> 00:52:06,223
So I see.

743
00:52:06,354 --> 00:52:07,469
What do you want?

744
00:52:08,114 --> 00:52:10,184
A moment of your time.

745
00:52:10,394 --> 00:52:12,907
We've got something
to celebrate.

746
00:52:13,233 --> 00:52:15,542
- What's that?
- Your new career.

747
00:52:15,673 --> 00:52:19,347
Lucille, I'm going to put you
in the movies.

748
00:52:19,472 --> 00:52:20,667
Movies!

749
00:52:20,793 --> 00:52:22,987
I've been watching you
for some time.

750
00:52:23,072 --> 00:52:25,461
You've got
that indefinable something.

751
00:52:25,992 --> 00:52:27,948
Star quality!

752
00:52:28,711 --> 00:52:32,306
That's my real ambition,
to be in films!

753
00:52:32,431 --> 00:52:35,024
I've got a meaty part for you.

754
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:37,824
Will I have to audition?

755
00:52:37,951 --> 00:52:40,510
That's what I'm here for.

756
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:43,827
I feel woozy.

757
00:52:45,709 --> 00:52:48,507
Let me loosen your clothes.

758
00:52:48,629 --> 00:52:53,623
What beautiful white fur
you've got, my dear.

759
00:52:55,908 --> 00:52:57,262
Lucille, you left this...

760
00:52:57,389 --> 00:53:00,107
Hike!
Can't you see that we're busy?

761
00:53:00,548 --> 00:53:02,299
- Lucille!
- Oh, Jesus!

762
00:53:02,828 --> 00:53:05,944
- Robert!
- You've been drinking.

763
00:53:07,266 --> 00:53:10,179
It's OK.
I've finished with her anyway.

764
00:53:10,546 --> 00:53:14,095
Oh, go for your life, kid.
She's a real good ride.

765
00:53:14,706 --> 00:53:17,663
- How could you do this?
- Robert!

766
00:53:18,225 --> 00:53:20,659
Lucille, ho could you?

767
00:53:20,785 --> 00:53:22,662
No!
Robert!

768
00:53:23,185 --> 00:53:24,903
Wait!

769
00:53:25,465 --> 00:53:28,740
Where's she for God's sake?
Look at the time!

770
00:53:28,864 --> 00:53:31,856
It's all right, Guv.
Miss Heidi's arrived on stage.

771
00:53:31,984 --> 00:53:34,896
At last!
From the top!

772
00:53:45,583 --> 00:53:48,050
<i>On a magic night...</i>

773
00:53:48,502 --> 00:53:51,255
<i>when the way you feel...</i>

774
00:53:51,702 --> 00:53:53,737
<i>is a mystery...</i>

775
00:53:54,861 --> 00:53:57,659
<i>that will be revealed...</i>

776
00:53:57,821 --> 00:54:00,573
<i>Could be an angel...</i>

777
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:03,692
<i>from up above...</i>

778
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:08,096
<i>with a flower...</i>

779
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:10,335
<i>from the garden of love.</i>

780
00:54:13,379 --> 00:54:16,495
<i>Garden of love...</i>

781
00:54:24,298 --> 00:54:26,686
<i>On another day...</i>

782
00:54:26,817 --> 00:54:29,490
<i>it may come again...</i>

783
00:54:31,576 --> 00:54:33,612
<i>It's a Valentine...</i>

784
00:54:34,297 --> 00:54:36,014
<i>from a special friend.</i>

785
00:54:37,496 --> 00:54:39,612
<i>That certain someone...</i>

786
00:54:40,736 --> 00:54:42,771
<i>you'be been thinking of...</i>

787
00:54:43,775 --> 00:54:47,290
<i>with a flower from the garden...</i>

788
00:54:47,414 --> 00:54:50,487
<i>the garden of love...</i>

789
00:54:54,013 --> 00:54:58,689
<i>garden of love...</i>

790
00:55:03,213 --> 00:55:08,844
<i>There are mysteries
that no one knows...</i>

791
00:55:09,932 --> 00:55:14,482
<i>someone offers you
a simple rose...</i>

792
00:55:14,651 --> 00:55:18,849
<i>There's no limit to...</i>

793
00:55:47,687 --> 00:55:49,005
It wasn't my fault.

794
00:55:49,126 --> 00:55:51,959
You've been over-eating again

795
00:55:52,126 --> 00:55:53,081
No I haven't.

796
00:55:54,526 --> 00:55:58,121
There is black forest cherry cake
in your cleavage.

797
00:55:58,885 --> 00:56:00,239
How did that get there?

798
00:56:00,366 --> 00:56:02,674
You know what chocolate
does to your system.

799
00:56:03,205 --> 00:56:04,876
It was only a small wedge.

800
00:56:05,004 --> 00:56:07,200
Your contract states
you are forbidden...

801
00:56:07,285 --> 00:56:09,479
to eat gateaux
on the day of a performance.

802
00:56:09,564 --> 00:56:12,317
- I was depressed.
- You're depressed!

803
00:56:12,444 --> 00:56:16,323
We're going out live in three hours,
for godsake.

804
00:56:16,444 --> 00:56:19,674
Don't speak to me like that.
You don't understand.

805
00:56:19,803 --> 00:56:22,522
None of you understand!

806
00:56:23,683 --> 00:56:26,799
Bletch... Bletch...

807
00:56:27,123 --> 00:56:31,751
Suddenly I feel very very old.

808
00:56:36,321 --> 00:56:38,551
Bletch!
Don't you want to have me?

809
00:56:38,681 --> 00:56:40,160
I must talk to you.

810
00:56:40,281 --> 00:56:41,793
Say you love only me!

811
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,274
Don't you love me?

812
00:56:43,401 --> 00:56:45,356
Don't you, Bletch?

813
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:48,469
Oh... er...

814
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:50,396
Bletch?

815
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:02,873
No!

816
00:57:02,998 --> 00:57:04,829
Heidi!
It's not what you think.

817
00:57:05,278 --> 00:57:06,233
Heidi!

818
00:57:19,515 --> 00:57:21,472
Miss Heidi,
what on earth's the matter?

819
00:57:29,034 --> 00:57:30,433
Damn!

820
00:57:53,872 --> 00:57:55,748
What took you so long?

821
00:57:55,871 --> 00:57:58,339
We were starting to think
you weren't going to show.

822
00:57:58,551 --> 00:58:03,305
We had some trouble
with Customs snooping around.

823
00:58:03,510 --> 00:58:04,465
Is it all there?

824
00:58:04,590 --> 00:58:06,103
Yeah, yeah.
It's all there.

825
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:07,299
I've got to go.

826
00:58:07,430 --> 00:58:08,987
Not so fast.

827
00:58:09,270 --> 00:58:11,385
It's all there, I tell you.

828
00:58:11,789 --> 00:58:14,542
What's the hurry, Louie?

829
00:58:16,469 --> 00:58:19,905
It's one hundred per cent
pure-uncut.

830
00:58:20,029 --> 00:58:21,507
I'm sure it is.

831
00:58:21,628 --> 00:58:23,936
Barry, do me a line.

832
00:58:36,347 --> 00:58:38,416
Some contracts
for you to sign, Mr. Bletch.

833
00:58:39,466 --> 00:58:42,026
Here Dennis.
I've got a little treat for you.

834
00:58:43,425 --> 00:58:45,495
Don't mind if I do Mr. Bletch.

835
00:59:14,662 --> 00:59:15,696
Borax!

836
00:59:15,941 --> 00:59:18,171
Honest to God,
I didn't know.

837
00:59:18,301 --> 00:59:20,019
I'm as surprised as you are.

838
00:59:20,301 --> 00:59:23,258
Please Mr. Bletch,
let's talk about this.

839
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:25,178
I think that's a very good idea.

840
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:27,137
Where's the merchandise?

841
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:31,336
It's... it's...

842
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:33,131
Speak up.
I can't hear you.

843
00:59:34,499 --> 00:59:36,808
It's down on the docks.

844
00:59:36,939 --> 00:59:40,010
Mr. Big's shipping it out
tonight.

845
00:59:40,138 --> 00:59:41,333
Whereabouts on the docks?

846
00:59:42,698 --> 00:59:44,017
Shed 11.

847
00:59:44,138 --> 00:59:46,572
There, that wasn't so hard,
was it?

848
00:59:47,618 --> 00:59:51,007
What are we going to do
with all this borax?

849
00:59:51,737 --> 00:59:53,932
You seem a bit congested, Louie.

850
00:59:54,057 --> 00:59:56,571
Maybe your passages need
cleaning.

851
00:59:56,897 --> 00:59:58,568
I don't understand.

852
00:59:58,896 --> 01:00:00,488
Say "ah".

853
01:00:00,616 --> 01:00:02,732
Oh, no... no!

854
01:00:02,936 --> 01:00:06,325
No, Mr. Bletch, please!

855
01:00:16,014 --> 01:00:19,324
You liquidated him real good,
boss.

856
01:00:27,532 --> 01:00:31,127
I think it's time we paid out
Mr. Big a visit.

857
01:00:34,692 --> 01:00:35,727
Bletch...

858
01:00:36,172 --> 01:00:39,800
- I'm sorry, the show's off.
- What are you talking about?

859
01:00:39,931 --> 01:00:41,125
Heidi refuses to perform.

860
01:00:41,211 --> 01:00:44,885
The network won't proceed without her
and cancel the transmission.

861
01:00:44,971 --> 01:00:46,801
What do you mean?
Of course she'll perform.

862
01:00:46,890 --> 01:00:47,925
I'm sorry Bletch.

863
01:00:48,050 --> 01:00:51,645
She's locked herself in her room
and won't talk to anyone.

864
01:00:52,450 --> 01:00:54,679
Give me five minutes.

865
01:00:55,809 --> 01:00:58,198
It's all over.
Go home everybody.

866
01:00:58,329 --> 01:00:59,477
It's kaput.

867
01:00:59,608 --> 01:01:00,961
Finito!
Buggered!

868
01:01:01,089 --> 01:01:03,522
It's all off!

869
01:01:03,968 --> 01:01:07,040
Oh my goodness!
Steady me, Barton.

870
01:01:07,288 --> 01:01:10,006
I think I'm going to faint.

871
01:01:10,807 --> 01:01:14,038
Heidi!
It's Bletch!

872
01:01:20,886 --> 01:01:24,242
Heidi,
I want to make love to you.

873
01:01:24,366 --> 01:01:26,356
Oh, Bletch!

874
01:01:26,485 --> 01:01:31,001
You drive me crazy.
Come over here and undo my buttons!

875
01:01:34,005 --> 01:01:36,757
You mad impetuous brute!

876
01:01:37,803 --> 01:01:40,238
I knew you'd come.

877
01:02:02,961 --> 01:02:05,155
Somebody call the network.

878
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:08,590
The show will go on!

879
01:02:27,558 --> 01:02:31,630
So I got out my razor
and slit his throat.

880
01:02:31,757 --> 01:02:34,191
Then I buggered the bastard.

881
01:02:35,277 --> 01:02:36,755
Oh, strut Cedric.

882
01:02:36,876 --> 01:02:39,344
It's bad enough getting wasted,
but...

883
01:02:39,476 --> 01:02:43,594
to have your last living memory
being rooted by a Scots psychopath...

884
01:02:43,716 --> 01:02:46,752
it's what I call a real bummer,
mate.

885
01:02:47,155 --> 01:02:49,544
What's that?

886
01:02:50,995 --> 01:02:52,268
Bastards!

887
01:03:46,628 --> 01:03:49,347
I'm buggered!

888
01:03:53,987 --> 01:03:56,581
Right men, let's load up.

889
01:04:10,585 --> 01:04:12,303
That's the lot, boss.

890
01:04:12,865 --> 01:04:14,742
Time we made ourselves scarce.

891
01:04:23,663 --> 01:04:24,618
Aaah!

892
01:04:24,743 --> 01:04:26,461
Oh, no!

893
01:04:26,583 --> 01:04:30,291
Help me boss!

894
01:04:33,862 --> 01:04:35,613
Move it, Trevor!

895
01:04:39,461 --> 01:04:42,533
Oh Jesus!
Shit!

896
01:04:44,821 --> 01:04:46,458
Drive, for Chrissake!

897
01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:50,133
Plant boot!

898
01:04:56,219 --> 01:04:59,052
God I hate arachnids!

899
01:05:19,617 --> 01:05:21,686
Christ-it's Mr. Big!

900
01:05:24,255 --> 01:05:28,373
Hello Bletch.
Where are you going?

901
01:05:28,495 --> 01:05:31,407
I'm taking what's mine.
Don't try to stop us.

902
01:05:31,535 --> 01:05:35,653
You're out of your league,
little fella.

903
01:05:35,775 --> 01:05:38,368
Kiss your arse goodbye!

904
01:05:38,494 --> 01:05:39,449
Take him out Trevor.

905
01:05:48,893 --> 01:05:52,522
Change down Trevor,
the duodenum's pretty steep.

906
01:05:58,412 --> 01:06:00,322
Which way, boss?
Left or right?

907
01:06:00,411 --> 01:06:01,560
Follow the light.

908
01:06:10,010 --> 01:06:12,240
Get me back to the theatre
double quick!

909
01:06:12,370 --> 01:06:13,769
Sure thing, boss.

910
01:06:14,370 --> 01:06:17,441
I'll have to change my suit.
I'm covered in ambergris.

911
01:06:21,769 --> 01:06:23,964
Where's Harry?
He's meant to be here!

912
01:06:24,089 --> 01:06:26,363
Move the carrot to the left.
Have you focused the spot?

913
01:06:26,488 --> 01:06:28,365
Where's Harry for God's sake?

914
01:06:28,488 --> 01:06:30,763
Don't look like
Harry's going to perform.

915
01:06:30,888 --> 01:06:32,161
He's had a bad turn.

916
01:06:32,287 --> 01:06:33,515
No problem...

917
01:06:33,647 --> 01:06:35,956
We'll bring forward
"The Garden of Love".

918
01:06:36,087 --> 01:06:37,759
We're on a roll everybody.

919
01:06:38,446 --> 01:06:41,756
Miss Heidi, you look radiant.

920
01:06:41,886 --> 01:06:44,797
Dorothy, I feel radiant!

921
01:06:44,925 --> 01:06:48,042
Tonight will be
the performance of my life!

922
01:06:48,645 --> 01:06:51,284
- Kill me if you want to, Harry.
- It's too lat.

923
01:06:51,445 --> 01:06:54,641
It won't make any difference.
The story's already gone to press.

924
01:06:55,124 --> 01:06:57,877
You overgrown maggot!
You're bluffing!

925
01:06:58,004 --> 01:06:59,483
Am I Harry?

926
01:06:59,604 --> 01:07:01,161
Extra! Extra!
Read all about it!

927
01:07:01,283 --> 01:07:03,878
Famous Feeble has
death row sex disease!

928
01:07:04,044 --> 01:07:08,958
Congratulations,
you're front-page news.

929
01:07:09,363 --> 01:07:12,035
Extra, extra!
Read all about it!

930
01:07:12,603 --> 01:07:15,400
Extra!
¡Extra, extra!

931
01:07:15,522 --> 01:07:18,241
Sex disease strikes
Feeble fraternity.

932
01:07:18,362 --> 01:07:20,511
Thank you, ma'am.
Extra, extra!

933
01:07:20,641 --> 01:07:22,552
Sex disease...
Thank you, sir.

934
01:07:25,761 --> 01:07:28,639
Jesus Christ!
Do you know anything about this?

935
01:07:28,761 --> 01:07:30,113
Not a thing, boss.

936
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:34,028
Why couldn't that bed-hopping bunny
keep his member to himself?

937
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:35,912
Who wrote this crap?

938
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:37,677
I've got a good idea, boss.

939
01:07:37,839 --> 01:07:39,398
Find him!

940
01:07:40,959 --> 01:07:44,918
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention please.

941
01:07:45,239 --> 01:07:48,275
Welcome to the newest,
the greatest...

942
01:07:48,358 --> 01:07:50,747
the most spectacular show...

943
01:07:50,878 --> 01:07:52,913
in entertainment history.

944
01:07:53,037 --> 01:07:54,993
Put your hand together...,

945
01:07:55,118 --> 01:07:58,826
for the fabulous
Feebles Variety Hour!

946
01:08:04,076 --> 01:08:07,307
<i>Meet the Feebles,
meet the Feebles.</i>

947
01:08:07,916 --> 01:08:10,793
<i>We're not average ordinary people.</i>

948
01:08:10,915 --> 01:08:14,703
<i>Meet the Feebles,
meet the Feebles.</i>

949
01:08:15,075 --> 01:08:17,873
This is a historic moment, Arthur.

950
01:08:18,475 --> 01:08:22,149
Tonight we rocket
into superstardom!

951
01:08:22,274 --> 01:08:25,663
It's an honour to be a part of it,
Mr. Bletch.

952

<i>Be sure we guarantee
to amuse you.</i>

953
01:08:30,153 --> 01:08:32,029
<i>Meet the Feebles,
meet the Feebles.</i>

954
01:08:34,193 --> 01:08:37,548
Hey Trev,
I've got fifty bucks, man.

955
01:08:37,672 --> 01:08:39,628
I've got to have it.
I'm on real soon.

956
01:08:39,752 --> 01:08:42,902
This is serious, man.
Look at my hands.

957
01:08:43,191 --> 01:08:44,670
Come with me.

958
01:08:45,711 --> 01:08:46,746
Gorblimey!

959
01:08:46,871 --> 01:08:49,180
Is that a real Havana, Mr. Bletch?

960
01:08:49,311 --> 01:08:51,744
Would you like one, Arthur?

961
01:08:51,870 --> 01:08:53,189
Would I ever?

962
01:09:04,348 --> 01:09:07,658
Thanks a million, Mr. Bletch.
You're a scholar and a gent.

963
01:09:11,028 --> 01:09:14,417
I haven't had one of these
since my twenty first.

964
01:09:17,187 --> 01:09:21,180
It's a real man's smoke,
ain't it, Mr. Bletch?

965
01:09:44,784 --> 01:09:46,421
<i>On another day...</i>

966
01:09:47,663 --> 01:09:49,619
<i>it may come again...</i>

967
01:09:50,783 --> 01:09:53,376
<i>it's a Valentine...</i>

968
01:09:53,503 --> 01:09:56,221

969
01:09:57,302 --> 01:09:59,099
<i>that certain someone...</i>

970
01:10:00,142 --> 01:10:03,019
Bletch,
it's going fabulously!

971
01:10:03,141 --> 01:10:04,860
I've just heard
from the network.

972
01:10:05,142 --> 01:10:07,939
They've confirmed
a syndicated series!

973
01:10:08,061 --> 01:10:12,815
And the critics!
The critics are adoring it!

974
01:10:13,260 --> 01:10:16,172
A syndicated series, eh?

975
01:10:16,820 --> 01:10:18,650
Well done, Sebastian.

976
01:10:18,819 --> 01:10:20,970
I can see the headlines now.

977
01:10:21,220 --> 01:10:23,494
"Director's Artistic Genius...

978
01:10:23,619 --> 01:10:25,974
Makes Feeble Evening...

979
01:10:26,099 --> 01:10:28,248
Outstanding Success".

980
01:10:28,538 --> 01:10:30,654
I've got to go on!

981
01:10:30,778 --> 01:10:32,370
I've got to go on!

982
01:10:32,498 --> 01:10:34,216
My public loves me.

983
01:10:34,337 --> 01:10:36,293
I can't disappoint them.

984
01:10:37,338 --> 01:10:40,056
Robert, we have to talk.

985
01:10:40,177 --> 01:10:41,895
We've nothing to say each other.

986
01:10:42,097 --> 01:10:44,007
I want to tell you what happened.

987
01:10:44,136 --> 01:10:45,535
I thought you were nice.

988
01:10:45,656 --> 01:10:47,009
I am nice.

989
01:10:47,136 --> 01:10:49,252
No, you're not.
You're loose!

990
01:10:50,455 --> 01:10:52,446
- And you drink!
- No!

991
01:10:53,576 --> 01:10:55,770
You're nothing but
a loose lush, Lucille!

992
01:10:55,855 --> 01:10:58,813
And... I never want
to see you again.

993
01:11:06,054 --> 01:11:11,969
<i>The garden of love...</i>

994
01:11:23,131 --> 01:11:26,282
I say everyone,
who's the dirty person...

995
01:11:26,411 --> 01:11:30,689
who did the great big stinky poo
that's blocking up the toilet?

996
01:11:30,811 --> 01:11:34,041
God Trevor, must you be
so disgusting?

997
01:11:34,170 --> 01:11:35,728
Oh, choice!

998
01:11:45,129 --> 01:11:46,801
What are you doing?
Let me go!

999
01:11:47,569 --> 01:11:50,560
You've been telling stories again,
haven't you?

1000
01:11:50,808 --> 01:11:54,118
You got a problem with the article,
write to the editor.

1001
01:11:54,248 --> 01:11:56,044
That won't be necessary.

1002
01:11:56,167 --> 01:11:58,556
Help me!

1003
01:11:59,327 --> 01:12:02,797
What do you know, boss,
a left-wing reporter!

1004
01:12:02,927 --> 01:12:05,963
We can't have a biased press,
can we Trevor?

1005
01:12:06,086 --> 01:12:07,280
No boss.

1006
01:12:14,965 --> 01:12:17,922
Now that's what I call
an impartial journalist.

1007
01:12:31,803 --> 01:12:34,077
Hello Bletch!

1008
01:12:34,562 --> 01:12:37,360
Heidi!
What the hell are you doing here?

1009
01:12:37,482 --> 01:12:38,915
Congratulations!

1010
01:12:39,042 --> 01:12:41,920
The show is a wonderful success!

1011
01:12:42,242 --> 01:12:43,311
What do you want?

1012
01:12:43,442 --> 01:12:46,320
Our encounter this afternoon
was so brief!

1013
01:12:46,682 --> 01:12:50,070
I thought you might like
a second helping.

1014
01:12:51,041 --> 01:12:51,996
Heidi!

1015
01:12:52,121 --> 01:12:54,554
For Chrissake
put your dress back on!

1016
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:56,353
Come and sit next to me.

1017
01:12:56,720 --> 01:12:59,711
If it's too hot for you,
I can turn on the air conditioning.

1018
01:12:59,839 --> 01:13:03,673
I'm hot Bletch,
but not the way you think.

1019
01:13:04,759 --> 01:13:08,069
You're not feeling shy,
are you Bletch?

1020
01:13:10,198 --> 01:13:12,951
Do you remember that time
in Paris?

1021
01:13:13,078 --> 01:13:16,752
We didn't leave the hotel
for three whole days!

1022
01:13:16,877 --> 01:13:17,913
I remember all right.

1023
01:13:17,998 --> 01:13:20,465
I had to go to the hospital
with severe chafing.

1024
01:13:20,597 --> 01:13:21,950
Kiss me, Bletch!

1025
01:13:22,077 --> 01:13:24,750
Get away from me!
You shuddering mound of blubber!

1026
01:13:24,877 --> 01:13:27,993
Have you any idea
how revolting you look?

1027
01:13:28,116 --> 01:13:29,595
Bletch... no!

1028
01:13:29,716 --> 01:13:31,434
You disgust me!
Look at you!

1029
01:13:31,516 --> 01:13:34,394
You're old and you're fat...
and you smell bad...

1030
01:13:34,516 --> 01:13:35,470
Aggh!

1031
01:13:35,555 --> 01:13:36,510
No!

1032
01:13:36,635 --> 01:13:38,466
I was going to wait
till after the show...

1033
01:13:38,554 --> 01:13:40,034
but I might as well tell you now.

1034
01:13:40,155 --> 01:13:43,112
You're through with the Feebles!
I don't need you!

1035
01:13:43,234 --> 01:13:45,702
I've got a syndicated series...

1036
01:13:45,834 --> 01:13:48,143
and I'm grooming Samantha
to be the star.

1037
01:13:48,553 --> 01:13:49,588
No!

1038
01:13:49,713 --> 01:13:52,944
I hope you enjoyed tonight.
That was your last performance!

1039
01:13:53,073 --> 01:13:55,063
Now get out of here!

1040
01:14:30,428 --> 01:14:34,706
And now, someone
who needs no introduction.

1041
01:14:35,388 --> 01:14:37,617
Heeere's...

1042
01:14:37,747 --> 01:14:38,703
Well.

1043
01:14:38,828 --> 01:14:40,579
...Harry...

1044
01:14:59,864 --> 01:15:01,742
Yipiii!

1045
01:15:11,664 --> 01:15:13,016
Launch!

1046
01:15:13,583 --> 01:15:15,573
Come on!
Launch the carrot!

1047
01:15:19,262 --> 01:15:22,493
What am I going to do?
Oh my god!

1048
01:15:22,982 --> 01:15:25,541
Sidney, you're going to have
to fill in for a few minutes.

1049
01:15:25,981 --> 01:15:29,018
But... I've got to go the toilet.

1050
01:15:29,141 --> 01:15:30,540
Improvise!

1051
01:15:30,821 --> 01:15:31,969
Lmprovise!

1052
01:15:32,581 --> 01:15:35,811
But I've got a really weak bladder.

1053
01:15:38,380 --> 01:15:39,574
Say something!

1054
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:41,849
Go on, say something!
Anything!

1055
01:15:42,779 --> 01:15:46,408
The show is going really well,
I think.

1056
01:15:54,139 --> 01:15:56,493
Goodbye, Bletch.

1057
01:16:04,056 --> 01:16:07,810
We'll drop the barrel balancing act
and bring the knife throwing forward.

1058
01:16:07,936 --> 01:16:11,531
Where the hell is Winyard?
Why isn't anybody listening to me?

1059
01:16:12,216 --> 01:16:15,048
And so without further ado
please give a big hand...

1060
01:16:15,176 --> 01:16:17,814
for our fabulous knife thrower.

1061
01:16:17,935 --> 01:16:18,890
Sidney!

1062
01:16:20,015 --> 01:16:21,892
Oh, no!

1063
01:16:22,015 --> 01:16:24,084
You philandering bastard!

1064
01:16:24,174 --> 01:16:27,769
Sandy, not in front of all the people!

1065
01:16:27,894 --> 01:16:30,361
What I have to say
I want the world to know.

1066
01:16:30,693 --> 01:16:33,571
He may look like
a lovable old pachyderm...

1067
01:16:33,693 --> 01:16:35,126
but he's a steaming great shit!

1068
01:16:35,253 --> 01:16:36,971
I don't believe it!

1069
01:16:46,091 --> 01:16:49,970
Goodbye life!
Hello death!

1070
01:17:10,009 --> 01:17:14,001
Hey Seb!
God to see you, man.

1071
01:17:14,128 --> 01:17:16,596
Pull yourself together!
You're next up!

1072
01:17:17,568 --> 01:17:22,163
Have you ever noticed
the beautiful lighting in this toilet?

1073
01:17:22,887 --> 01:17:25,002
He used me to vent
his lustful passions...

1074
01:17:25,127 --> 01:17:27,595
but as soon as I was up the duff
it was another story.

1075
01:17:27,727 --> 01:17:31,037
He had his pleasure
and left me with this.

1076
01:17:31,166 --> 01:17:32,884
Dadda!

1077
01:17:33,006 --> 01:17:35,121
Seymour, run to Daddy.

1078
01:17:35,245 --> 01:17:36,884
Dadda! Dadda!

1079
01:17:37,006 --> 01:17:38,882
Oh, no!
Look, I've got to go.

1080
01:17:39,005 --> 01:17:40,677
I've got an urgent call of nature.

1081
01:17:41,805 --> 01:17:43,796
That's right, run away!

1082
01:17:43,925 --> 01:17:45,801
That's what you've always done.

1083
01:17:48,404 --> 01:17:51,440
I don't think I'm going to make it!

1084
01:17:54,723 --> 01:17:57,681
Oh yes, a good conditioner
works wonders on my coat.

1085
01:17:58,283 --> 01:18:00,671
Oh, Sid, no!

1086
01:18:00,802 --> 01:18:03,635
Oh sorry guys.
I was bursting.

1087
01:18:03,762 --> 01:18:04,911
Oh Sid-you bastard!

1088
01:18:05,002 --> 01:18:07,435
You're supposed to wait
till it's all clear!

1089
01:18:07,681 --> 01:18:09,832
Thanks a lot, Sid!
I'm on in five minutes.

1090
01:18:17,720 --> 01:18:20,837
Goodbye life!

1091
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:33,316
Oh, there it is!

1092
01:18:39,317 --> 01:18:41,878
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to interrupt.

1093
01:18:42,238 --> 01:18:43,989
Don't let me stop you.

1094
01:18:47,437 --> 01:18:50,234
I think you'll find
the safety catch is on.

1095
01:18:54,396 --> 01:18:58,752
Eat lead you man-stealing slut!

1096
01:19:15,353 --> 01:19:18,629
Oh yeah!
Hey, wow!

1097
01:19:19,113 --> 01:19:20,705
Amazing!

1098
01:19:25,632 --> 01:19:26,951
Bastard!

1099
01:19:30,512 --> 01:19:31,466
Bastard!

1100
01:19:37,350 --> 01:19:38,305
Ach!

1101
01:19:53,508 --> 01:19:56,307
That's it!
I'm left no alternative!

1102
01:19:56,429 --> 01:20:00,306
I don't care what Bletch says.
We're doing my song!

1103
01:20:00,427 --> 01:20:04,340
It's up to me to save the show,
as usual.

1104
01:20:04,587 --> 01:20:07,101
All right, everybody!
As we rehearsed!

1105
01:20:07,507 --> 01:20:09,065
Ah, please God!

1106
01:20:09,187 --> 01:20:12,577
I know I've been a bad bunny...

1107
01:20:12,707 --> 01:20:16,983
but if you make me well again
I promise... promise...

1108
01:20:17,065 --> 01:20:19,898
I'll be good
for the rest of my life.

1109
01:20:21,825 --> 01:20:23,781
- What?
- Hi Harry.

1110
01:20:23,905 --> 01:20:26,657
I've just received your test results...

1111
01:20:26,784 --> 01:20:28,059
and guess what...

1112
01:20:28,185 --> 01:20:30,857
- I made a boo boo.
- A boo boo?

1113
01:20:30,984 --> 01:20:33,019
Yeah Harry.
You're in the clear.

1114
01:20:33,384 --> 01:20:35,943
You just got a bad case
of bunny pox.

1115
01:20:36,543 --> 01:20:39,819
Take two aspirins
and stay in bed for a week.

1116
01:20:40,943 --> 01:20:42,660
I'll send you my bill.

1117
01:20:43,462 --> 01:20:46,420
Yippeee!

1118
01:20:46,582 --> 01:20:48,537
Yipeeee!

1119
01:20:48,701 --> 01:20:51,375
I'm in the clear everybody!

1120
01:20:51,502 --> 01:20:54,573
I haven't got it!
I haven't got myxamatosis!

1121
01:20:54,741 --> 01:20:56,060
I haven't got myx...

1122
01:21:04,499 --> 01:21:07,253
He wouldn't dare!

1123
01:21:07,819 --> 01:21:09,696
Oh Christ, he's not!

1124
01:21:09,899 --> 01:21:12,129
Oh yes he is, boss.

1125
01:21:19,698 --> 01:21:22,053
<i>Sodomy...</i>

1126
01:21:22,178 --> 01:21:23,770
<i>you must think it
very odd of me...</i>

1127
01:21:23,897 --> 01:21:26,616
<i>that I enjoy the act of sodomy.</i>

1128
01:21:26,737 --> 01:21:29,046
<i>You might call the wrath
of God on me...</i>

1129
01:21:29,177 --> 01:21:34,853
<i>but if you try it then you might agree
that you enjoy the act of sodomy.</i>

1130
01:21:40,535 --> 01:21:44,847
<i>Don't worry if you feel ashamed.
It's been around for years.</i>

1131
01:21:44,975 --> 01:21:48,364
<i>Thousands more than can be named
are interested in rears.</i>

1132
01:21:49,015 --> 01:21:51,528
<i>Don't worry about hell...</i>

1133
01:21:51,654 --> 01:21:53,723
<i>no harm will come to your soul.</i>

1134
01:21:53,853 --> 01:21:59,292
<i>We're not all Pentecostal,
but everybody's got an arsehole.</i>

1135
01:22:00,373 --> 01:22:03,170
<i>Let me tell you about sodomy.</i>

1136
01:22:03,292 --> 01:22:05,488
<i>You must think it very odd of me...</i>

1137
01:22:05,613 --> 01:22:08,331
<i>that I enjoy the act of sodomy.</i>

1138
01:22:08,452 --> 01:22:11,205
<i>You may call the wrath of God

1139
01:22:11,332 --> 01:22:16,803
<i>but if you try it then you might agree
that you enjoy the act of sodomy.</i>

1140
01:22:17,451 --> 01:22:22,160
<i>It might just improve your sex,
it's a hard act to follow.</i>

1141
01:22:22,290 --> 01:22:25,326
<i>A fact that fundamentalists
find difficult to swallow.</i>

1142
01:22:26,690 --> 01:22:28,123
<i>So join me as I sing...</i>

1143
01:22:28,250 --> 01:22:31,764
<i>of an activity that's fun.</i>

1144
01:22:31,889 --> 01:22:37,202
<i>Open up your ring
and try it front to bum.</i>

1145
01:22:37,329 --> 01:22:40,126
<i>Bum, bum, bum, bum...</i>

1146
01:22:40,248 --> 01:22:41,475
<i>Sodomy...</i>

1147
01:22:41,607 --> 01:22:44,202
<i>you must think it very odd of me...</i>

1148
01:22:44,328 --> 01:22:47,205
<i>that I enjoy the act of sodomy.</i>

1149
01:22:47,327 --> 01:22:50,125
<i>You might call the wrath of God

1150
01:22:50,247 --> 01:22:56,924
<i>but if you try it then you might agree
that you enjoy the act of sodomy.</i>

1151
01:23:01,005 --> 01:23:02,358
<i>Sodomy!</i>

1152
01:23:16,924 --> 01:23:18,675
- Trevor.
- Yes boss?

1153
01:23:18,803 --> 01:23:21,875
I want that fudge-packer eliminated.

1154
01:23:28,722 --> 01:23:30,552
Now put that gun down Heidi.

1155
01:23:31,082 --> 01:23:34,312
You're not solving anything
by massacring people.

1156
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:44,197
<i>Meet the Feebles,
meet the Feebles...</i>

1157
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:47,676
<i>we're not average ordinary people...</i>

1158
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:51,758
<i>Meet the Feebles,
meet the Feebles...</i>

1159
01:24:23,635 --> 01:24:24,863
My god!

1160
01:24:25,075 --> 01:24:27,430
Oh god no!

1161
01:25:08,870 --> 01:25:10,427
Seymour!

1162
01:25:11,309 --> 01:25:12,424
Seymour!

1163
01:25:15,269 --> 01:25:18,944
I'm coming!
Seymour!

1164
01:25:24,388 --> 01:25:26,947
Daddy...

1165
01:25:27,787 --> 01:25:30,620
Daddy is here!
Seymour!

1166
01:25:30,747 --> 01:25:33,340
Seymour!

1167
01:25:39,786 --> 01:25:41,742
Daddy!

1168
01:26:14,462 --> 01:26:16,691
I don't care what you've done,
Lucille.

1169
01:26:16,821 --> 01:26:18,777
I love you so very very much...

1170
01:26:18,941 --> 01:26:20,818
and I want you to marry me.

1171
01:26:20,941 --> 01:26:24,489
Oh Robert, I love you too!

1172
01:26:24,620 --> 01:26:27,009
I was never unfaithful,
it was Trevor.

1173
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:29,893
He drugged my drink
and tried to ravish me.

1174
01:26:30,460 --> 01:26:32,051
That dirty rat!

1175
01:26:36,699 --> 01:26:37,767
Heidi!

1176
01:26:40,499 --> 01:26:42,375
Put the gun down!

1177
01:27:17,854 --> 01:27:21,004
Heidi, for godsake!

1178
01:27:24,933 --> 01:27:29,006
Heidi, I still love you!

1179
01:27:34,452 --> 01:27:36,806
Bletch...

1180
01:27:47,850 --> 01:27:49,920
Kill her, Trevor!

1181
01:27:50,050 --> 01:27:52,085
Lt'll be a pleasure, boss.

1182
01:27:53,009 --> 01:27:55,000
You rotter!

1183
01:28:15,927 --> 01:28:17,564
Shit!

1184
01:28:33,964 --> 01:28:38,515
Miss Heidi,
I know you're a real star...

1185
01:28:38,644 --> 01:28:41,362
but I'm afraid I'm going to
have to dob you in.

1186
01:28:43,563 --> 01:28:46,600
Could you do
one last thing for me, Arthur?

1187
01:28:47,522 --> 01:28:49,400
Anything, Miss Heidi.

1188
01:28:51,482 --> 01:28:54,315
