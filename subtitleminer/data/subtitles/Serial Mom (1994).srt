00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:52,735
That's a nice dress you're wearing
this morning, Misty.

2
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:55,103
- Thanks, Dad.
- Want the entertainment section?

3
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,166
Not yet, Dad. Thanks.

4
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:59,575
- Got any donuts?
- Of course not, Chip.

5
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:02,171
- You know they're bad for the teeth.
- Always the dentist.

6
00:03:02,248 --> 00:03:03,943
Who wants fruit salad?

7
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,349
I do, please.

8
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:08,387
Misty, that's not gum
in your mouth, is it?

9
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:10,488
It's sugarless.

10
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:14,521
Misty, you know
how I hate gum.

11
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:18,223
- All that chomping and chewing.
- I'm sorry, Mom.

12
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:23,625
You think I can get 50 cents
for "Village People" on vinyl?

13
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,364
You might get a buck.

14
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:28,100
Carl can't believe how much
I make at swap meets.

15
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:31,974
- Who, may I ask, is Carl?
- Just a boy.

16
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,138
He's picking me up this morning.

17
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,148
Here we go again.

18
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,150
He's really cute!

19
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,209
Misty, cute is not enough.
You know that.

20
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:43,449
- She sure can pick 'em.
- He goes to college with me.

21
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:45,423
Leave her alone, Chip.

22
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:47,982
I think it's great
Misty's got a new beau.

23
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:50,026
Chip, honey?

24
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,327
Thanks, Mom.

25
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,395
Listen to this.

26
00:03:56,469 --> 00:04:00,098
"Hillside Strangler gets
his college degree in prison. "

27
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,440
- That's nice, dear.
- Nice?

28
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:05,101
He should have been executed!

29
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:09,042
Yeah. The death penalty.

30
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:10,878
He killed people, Mom.

31
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,441
We all have our bad days.

32
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,716
You'd probably date him.
"He's cute!"

33
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,281
All right. That's enough.

34
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:22,456
Dad, have you ever seen
"Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer"?

35
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:24,928
- Oh, sure, Chip.
- I most certainly have not!

36
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:28,726
You've been working
in that video shop too long.

37
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:31,795
Mind your own business.

38
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:35,136
It better hadn't be interfering
with your school work.

39
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,773
I do great in school, Dad.

40
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:41,143
Well, your mother has PTA today.

41
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:43,375
We'll see what your teacher
has to say.

42
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,314
Mom, I hate Mr. Stubbins.

43
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:48,877
Don't say "hate," dear.
"Hate" is a very serious word.

44
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:01,127
There!

45
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:04,392
Scrambled eggs anybody?

46
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,680
Mrs. Sutphin?

47
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:18,740
I'm Detective Pike.
This is Detective Gracey.

48
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,581
Come in.

49
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:27,959
I'm Dr. Eugene Sutphin. What
seems to be the trouble, officers?

50
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:31,087
- Is there a killer loose?
- No, son, nothing that exciting.

51
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:34,156
This is our son Chip
and our daughter Misty.

52
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:44,167
Officer, I'm sorry, but we don't allow
gum in this house.

53
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:46,968
Sorry, ma'am.

54
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,839
We're investigating
obscene phone calls...

55
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:53,852
and mail threats to a certain
Mrs. Dottie Hinkle.

56
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:56,786
- I know Dottie.
- She lives right down the street.

57
00:05:56,856 --> 00:06:00,257
- Could you take a look at this-
- And tell us who might be responsible?

58
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:04,194
I should warn you:
This note contains language.

59
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:12,233
Oh, my!

60
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:14,068
That is the limit!

61
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,573
Let me see!

62
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:18,701
No, son.
This is a matter for adults.

63
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,938
Officers, I have never even said
the "P" word out loud...

64
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:24,005
let alone written it down.

65
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:25,573
No woman would.

66
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:28,250
Officers...

67
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:29,845
life doesn't have to be ugly.

68
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:32,550
See. Look at the birds out there.

69
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,525
Listen to their call.

70
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:51,534
Chip, there's your ride.

71
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:55,076
I'm gonna be late for work.
Bye, honey.

72
00:06:57,683 --> 00:06:58,877
Hi, Scotty.

73
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:03,417
- Thanks for your time, everybody.
- Bye, Detective Pike.

74
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:07,119
- Hi, Birdie.
- Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Sutphin.

75
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,888
That's Birdie. She's a horror nut,
just like my son.

76
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:15,325
Birdie, this is Detective Gracey
and Detective Pike.

77
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:18,063
- Hiya, boys.
- Bye-bye, honey!

78
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:19,934
Good morning, Scott.

79
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,265
Misty, look what I got:
a Pee-Wee Herman doll.

80
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:25,333
Can you sell it for me
at the flea market?

81
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:28,676
Wow! Still in the box!
I sure can!

82
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:30,404
Oh, God.

83
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:32,474
Here comes Carl.

84
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:38,948
You must be Mrs. Sutphin.
Carl Pageant.

85
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:41,550
Oh, yes. Misty's date.

86
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,561
More of a friend, really.

87
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:46,658
- Take it easy, man.
- Bye.

88
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:49,424
See what Birdie gave me
to sell at the flea market?

89
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:51,026
That guy's a weirdo.
Come on. Let's go.

90
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:53,094
I'll take it.

91
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:56,932
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, honey.

92
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:58,874
Oh, detectives.

93
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:00,936
Here's something you should be
interested in:

94
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:03,447
a grown boy who doesn't wear
his seat belts.

95
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:14,149
Christ, that one's
Beaver Cleaver's mother.

96
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:18,161
Leave her alone.

97
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:21,792
Mrs. Sutphin's about as normal
and nice a lady as we're going to find.

98
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,743
Is this the Cocksucker residence?

99
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,084
Goddamn you,
stop calling here!

100
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:46,716
- Isn't this 4215 Pussy Way?
- You bitch!

101
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:49,727
Now let me check the zip code:
212-FUCK-YOU.

102
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:56,024
Beverly darling, you home?

103
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:59,435
The police are tracing this call
this very minute.

104
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:02,633
Well, Dottie Hinkle, then why
aren't they here, fuckface?

105
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,005
Fuck you!

106
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:10,939
Beverly, you home?

107
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:13,744
I know you are.

108
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:33,264
- Didn't I just say "fuck you"?
- I beg your pardon.

109
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,530
Who is this?

110
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:37,872
Mrs. Wilson
from the telephone company.

111
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:41,971
I understand you're having problems
with an obscene phone caller.

112
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:46,075
Yes, I am. I'm sorry, Mrs. Wilson,
but this is driving me crazy.

113
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:48,746
I've had my number changed
twice already.

114
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:50,880
I'm a divorced woman.
Please help me.

115
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:06,935
What exactly does
this sick individual say to you?

116
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,639
I can't say the words out loud.
I don't use bad language.

117
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:14,339
I know it's difficult, but we need
to know the exact words.

118
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:16,643
I'll try.

119
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:18,684
"Cocksucker. "
That's what she calls me.

120
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,151
Listen to your filthy mouth,
you fuckin' whore!

121
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,448
Goddamn you!

122
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:30,861
- Motherfucker!
- Cocksucker!

123
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:35,025
- Rosemary.
- Are you all right?

124
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:37,433
Yes, of course, I'm fine.

125
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:39,494
How nice. You remembered.

126
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:41,005
It's the least I could do.

127
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:44,068
I heard shouting.

128
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:47,872
It's that cable TV company.
You know how they are.

129
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:51,545
- Did you hear about poor Dottie Hinkle?
- Yes, I did.

130
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:54,848
It's terrifying. The police were
at my house this morning.

131
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:59,186
Now, who on earth would want
to harass poor Dottie Hinkle?

132
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:11,555
Mr. Stubbins, my son studies
every night.

133
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:14,064
He's trying as hard as he can!

134
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:17,227
Some teenagers just aren't
college material, Mrs. Taplotter.

135
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:19,134
It's nothing to cry over.

136
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:22,197
Now, there are other parents
waiting.

137
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,469
Thank you for taking the time
to come to PTA.

138
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,445
- Hi, Betty.
- Oh, hi, Beverly.

139
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:32,313
- I love your outfit.
- Thanks.

140
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:35,777
Liz Claiborne.

141
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:38,179
Well, Mrs. Sutphin,
where's that husband of yours?

142
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:41,317
Feeling a little down in the mouth?

143
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:46,825
Ralph, you're so funny.

144
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,962
Yes, right here.

145
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:02,912
I'm Paul Stubbins,
Chip's math teacher.

146
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:04,745
It's so nice to meet you.

147
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:07,479
Here's a little something I made.

148
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,655
Fruitcake. Thank you.

149
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:13,487
Have a seat.

150
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:15,683
Bon appétit.

151
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,460
Chip's off to a fine start this year.

152
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:20,795
He's focused, conscientious...

153
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:23,027
participates actively
in classroom discussions.

154
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:24,763
He's a good boy.

155
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:26,464
There is one big problem, though.

156
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:27,904
What is it?

157
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:31,500
His unhealthy obsession
with sick horror films.

158
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,504
Chip's assistant manager
at a video store.

159
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:38,573
That's no excuse
for a morbid imagination.

160
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,347
I caught him drawing this
in class last week.

161
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:46,016
- Is there a problem at home?
- Of course not!

162
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:49,720
Divorce? Alcoholic relative?

163
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:53,128
Tell me: Did Chip torture animals
when he was young?

164
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,826
No, he did not!

165
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:58,700
We are a loving
and supportive family.

166
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:01,865
Well, you're doing
something wrong.

167
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:03,738
I'd recommend therapy
for your son.

168
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:07,911
Thank you for taking the time
to come to PTA.

169
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,434
Watch this.

170
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:42,235
Scotty, watch this.

171
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:46,606
It's a sheep's tongue.

172
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:49,341
This shit is sickening!
Come on, put on some pussy.

173
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:50,643
Look, dickhead.

174
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:54,978
Blood feast.

175
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:57,318
The "Citizen Kane"
of gore movies.

176
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,958
I don't know what it is about today,
but I feel great!

177
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:08,022
- Cookie?
- Excuse me, Mrs. Sutphin!

178
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:09,928
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, Mrs. Sutphin.

179
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:11,492
Hi, guys.

180
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:16,205
- Look how fake that looks!
- Oh, you kids!

181
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:17,606
Here. Have a cookie
and run along home.

182
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:20,804
- But, Mom, the video's not over.
- Don't you "but Mom" me.

183
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:23,143
Mr. Stubbins seems to think
that these silly movies...

184
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:25,183
are interfering
with your schoolwork.

185
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,740
Oh, boy!

186
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,684
Mr. Stubbins sucks.

187
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:31,780
Man, that one made me puke!

188
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:33,757
It's supposed to make you puke.

189
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,623
You forgot something.

190
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:38,092
- Are we leaving?
- Yes, you are.

191
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:44,332
Bye, Birdie.
See ya, Scotty.

192
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:51,537
Now, Chip honey...

193
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:54,875
I know how hard it is
being a teenager.

194
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:59,178
I understand. I'm your mother,
and I love you.

195
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:02,453
Could we watch that scene again?

196
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,887
You know, the one where
he rips her heart out? Please?

197
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:19,535
Ladies and gentlemen,
the perfect meat loaf.

198
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:21,300
Looks good, Mom.

199
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,840
Nothing like a home-cooked meal,
honey.

200
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:26,241
Misty, I made you your favorite
sesame broccoli.

201
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:28,040
Carl says if I lose ten pounds
he'll take me...

202
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:31,173
to the University of Maryland
Memorial Day Beach Blast!

203
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,980
Honey, I think that's great
if you wanna lose weight...

204
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,543
but I think you should do it
for yourself...

205
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:37,646
not for some boy
you hardly even know.

206
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:40,583
Carl's a jerk!

207
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:42,593
He certainly drives like a jerk.

208
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:46,990
Carl makes me happy and that
threatens this family, doesn't it?

209
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,590
Doesn't threaten me, honey.
I'm happy.

210
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:50,567
I'm happy too.

211
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:52,263
We just want you to be happy.

212
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:55,534
I'm so happy I could shit.

213
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:59,077
You know how I hate
the brown word.

214
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:12,185
That's Rosemary.
Something must be wrong.

215
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:16,492
Turn on the news.

216
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:18,553
A teacher at your school
has been murdered!

217
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:19,756
- Murdered?
- Who?

218
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,566
A Mr. Stuber or Stubins.

219
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:25,694
Mr. Stubbins.
That's my math teacher!

220
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:29,806
Which channel?

221
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,570
It's on all of them.

222
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,207
Police claim the driver
of the hit-and-run vehicle...

223
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,182
ran down the teacher
in cold blood.

224
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:41,082
- Did you hear?
- What happened?

225
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:43,485
This is so cool.
It's just like a horror movie.

226
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:45,386
It's on. I'll call you back.

227
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:48,588
Mr. Paul Stubbins was
38 years old.

228
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,925
Whoever did this
should get the death penalty.

229
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:53,931
So far only one eyewitness
has surfaced.

230
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:55,990
Young lady, what did you see?

231
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:59,435
- It was a blue car.
- That's Lu-Ann Hodges.

232
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:01,473
- She's a stoner!
- A what?

233
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,167
A pothead.

234
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:04,732
A blue station wagon.

235
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,005
That's like your car, Beverly!

236
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:09,274
I'm not that bad a driver!

237
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:10,975
It was sickenin', man!

238
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:13,210
It flattened Mr. Stubbins
just like a pancake.

239
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,414
- God, man, puke time, man!
- Look at her hair.

240
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:20,714
Turn it off, honey.

241
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:24,662
Can't believe
Mr. Stubbins is dead.

242
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,755
You said you hated him.

243
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,426
He was an asshole,
but he didn't deserve to die.

244
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,475
I can't stop thinking
about that poor teacher.

245
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:45,946
Good night, honey.
Don't read too late.

246
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:48,916
We've got a big day
with the birds tomorrow.

247
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:51,547
I've identified
every little birdie...

248
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:54,353
we're gonna see tomorrow.

249
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:56,087
Night, honey.

250
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,466
Don't I get
a good-night kiss?

251
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:09,566
I thought with all the sadness
you wouldn't want to-

252
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:12,269
We have to concentrate
on life, Eugene.

253
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:20,383
It's all right with me.

254
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,081
You want to, honey?

255
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:32,560
- You think the kids are awake?
- We could be very quiet.

256
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:34,360
I love that you're my wife.

257
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:36,424
You're not so bad yourself,
cuckoo bird.

258
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:38,594
You bring me such peace.

259
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:52,582
Don't wake the kids!

260
00:20:57,856 --> 00:21:00,848
Honey, you're hot tonight!

261
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,083
Be quiet!

262
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:17,006
Honey, I'm ready...

263
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:18,667
now!

264
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:35,258
There's Dee Dee.
She's my favorite starling.

265
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,622
She's here every morning
for breakfast.

266
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:40,790
Well, honey, starlings are originally
from Europe. you know.

267
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:42,356
No wonder Dee Dee's hungry.

268
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:45,164
It's a long journey
all the way here to Baltimore.

269
00:21:57,716 --> 00:22:00,116
It's Ralph Sterner.
I've got a dental emergency here.

270
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:03,120
This goddamn tooth
is killing me.

271
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:05,418
Mr. Sterner,
if you'll just call my office...

272
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,458
I'm sure we can see you
on Monday.

273
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:09,255
Monday?

274
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:13,258
This is Betty Sterner.
He'll die by Monday!

275
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:16,529
The roots are infected.
He might have a heart attack.

276
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:20,469
All right. Ten o'clock.

277
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:22,029
I'm sorry, honey.

278
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:25,699
But the birds will still be there
next week.

279
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:27,438
It's okay.

280
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,139
I understand.

281
00:22:29,214 --> 00:22:30,545
I'll go fix breakfast.

282
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,692
God!

283
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:45,354
Mom, what's the matter?

284
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:46,988
It's just time to get up,
that's all.

285
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:48,726
Don't want you to be late
for work.

286
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,199
You scared me.

287
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:53,805
Honey, what's wrong?

288
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:57,808
I'm stood up.
I'll kill that bastard!

289
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:04,510
I mean it. He should be dead,
that lousy creep.

290
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:07,882
He told me he'd be here.
I'll kill him.

291
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:11,312
Don't use words
unless you mean them, honey.

292
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:18,491
- It's him!
- No, it's the police.

293
00:23:23,668 --> 00:23:25,033
Morning, officers.

294
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:27,867
Good morning, Mrs. Sutphin.

295
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:29,702
Hi, Detective Pike.

296
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:31,931
Morning.

297
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:36,280
I presume you know about the death
of Mr. Stubbins.

298
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:40,416
A fine man. A good teacher.

299
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,787
Contusions, fractures,
rupture of numerous vital organs.

300
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:47,381
What a mess.

301
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:51,856
No, honey, that's Scotty.

302
00:23:53,498 --> 00:23:55,432
Scotty who doesn't wear
his seat belts.

303
00:23:57,202 --> 00:23:58,794
Good morning, detectives.

304
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:01,365
"Nightmare On Calverton Court. "

305
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,567
"The Maryland Teacher Massacre. "

306
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:05,473
It's not funny, son.

307
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:07,701
Did you drive your car...

308
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,371
to the PTA meeting yesterday,
Mrs. Sutphin?

309
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,109
Yes, I did.

310
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:14,948
Detectives, what is this
all about?

311
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,147
I know this sounds weird,
Mr. Sutphin, but...

312
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:18,883
the Department of Motor Vehicles'
computer...

313
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:20,925
shows only one
blue station wagon...

314
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:23,825
registered to a parent
of any of Mr. Stubbins' pupils.

315
00:24:24,896 --> 00:24:27,262
Surely you don't think
Beverly was involved in this!

316
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:28,492
She did it!

317
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:30,933
Aimed the car right at him
and mowed him down!

318
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:34,437
Shut up, Scotty.

319
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:40,572
As I understand it,
the only eyewitness...

320
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:42,237
was a drug user.

321
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,680
I got somebody
you can run over, Mother.

322
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:49,147
That's a terrible thing to say!

323
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:51,746
Detectives, it's time for you
to leave.

324
00:24:52,757 --> 00:24:55,089
My wife knows nothing
about this terrible accident.

325
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,355
Murder, honey.

326
00:24:58,129 --> 00:25:00,120
Now here's a babe!

327
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:02,063
Let's see that, young man.

328
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:08,068
"P" as in-

329
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:10,004
"People who don't mind
their own business. "

330
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:11,736
Darling, it's Rosemary Ackerman's.

331
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:16,370
You can tell
by the subscription label.

332
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:19,315
I don't like to read about movies.
They're so violent.

333
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:23,085
Besides, I always recycle
my magazines.

334
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,151
Wait for me, boys!

335
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:34,884
Here. All rinsed
and ready to recycle.

336
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,827
- Good mornin', Mrs. Sutphin.
- Good morning, Gus, Sloppy.

337
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:40,456
You boys work so hard
for the environment...

338
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:41,931
I brought you something.

339
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,991
A little drink
never hurt anybody.

340
00:26:47,305 --> 00:26:48,795
Damn, that's good stuff!

341
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:52,633
Can you believe
that goddamn litter bugger?

342
00:26:53,645 --> 00:26:55,545
I have told her and told her...

343
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,605
it takes 90 to 100 years...

344
00:26:57,682 --> 00:26:59,047
for a tin can to decompose...

345
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:01,483
and she still won't recycle!

346
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:03,885
Cost the taxpayers
millions of dollars last year...

347
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:06,822
but she don't care nothin'
about the national budget.

348
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:09,916
I hate Mrs. Ackerman.

349
00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:12,964
- I hate her too!
- I hate her guts.

350
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:16,398
You know, somebody
ought to kill her.

351
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,129
Give her a...

352
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,162
happy face...

353
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,634
and then recycle her.

354
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:29,303
For the sake of this planet...

355
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:31,178
somebody just might.

356
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:35,478
But your boyfriend was convicted...

357
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:37,214
of killing twelve people.

358
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:38,778
I don't judge him.

359
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:42,349
I don't get it.
How can you love a mass murderer?

360
00:27:42,427 --> 00:27:45,157
Easy. He's handsome,
he's famous...

361
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:47,494
and we get conjugal visits.

362
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:50,334
Serial hags.

363
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:52,336
Women who love men
who mutilate.

364
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:55,635
- We'll be right back-
- Turn it off.

365
00:27:55,707 --> 00:27:57,231
Violence is everywhere
these days.

366
00:27:58,209 --> 00:28:01,940
It's just Beverly!
Come in.

367
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,947
She scared me!

368
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:06,842
Would you like a beer?

369
00:28:06,918 --> 00:28:09,478
No, not me.
Just a little coffee?

370
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:11,181
Dottie, I'm so sorry.

371
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:14,157
- I heard about your troubles.
- It's not fair!

372
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:23,330
Are those pussy willows?

373
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:25,335
Dried ones.

374
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:27,064
Aren't they pretty?

375
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:29,697
What did you just say?

376
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:32,738
Pussy willows, Dottie.

377
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:36,337
My goodness!

378
00:28:36,414 --> 00:28:38,405
- What are you doing?
- I didn't do it!

379
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:41,247
My Franklin Mint Faberge egg!

380
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:44,117
Dottie didn't mean to be so clumsy.
You're sorry, aren't you?

381
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:47,386
I did not break your egg!
She did!

382
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:49,654
Dottie, you could at least apologize.

383
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,559
I collect Franklin Mint!

384
00:28:51,629 --> 00:28:54,564
We'll go to the antique market
and find you another one.

385
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:58,591
Misty tells me there's a whole booth
filled with Franklin Mint stuff.

386
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:02,333
Dottie, you lock up, won't you?
I'll take care of poor Rosemary.

387
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,602
But I heard her voice.

388
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:06,371
It's her!

389
00:29:15,153 --> 00:29:18,145
Mr. Sterner, you've lost
a tiny filling.

390
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:21,215
I have to drill deeply enough
to remove all the decay.

391
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:23,283
All right, go ahead.
But be careful.

392
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:24,988
It really hurts.

393
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:28,826
Open. Wider.

394
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,258
Very wide.

395
00:29:42,847 --> 00:29:45,714
Mrs. Sterner,
you can't go back there.

396
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:51,119
Goddamn you! You're trying
to hurt me on purpose!

397
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:52,747
Are you okay, Ralph?

398
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:54,883
Mrs. Sterner, please stay
in the waiting room.

399
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:58,053
Help me, Betty! He's worse than
the dentist in "The Marathon Man"!

400
00:29:58,663 --> 00:30:00,153
I'm sorry to interrupt...

401
00:30:00,231 --> 00:30:05,225
but there are two police detectives
waiting to see you in your office.

402
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:08,061
Fine.

403
00:30:10,675 --> 00:30:12,802
Good morning.
What is it, officers?

404
00:30:12,877 --> 00:30:16,335
- My patient is waiting.
- Doctor, is your wife a big reader?

405
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:18,575
Bird books, mostly.

406
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,345
Like these we found
in her garbage?

407
00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:22,909
"Urge to Kill,"
"Mass Murder In Houston"?

408
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,217
I'm sure those are
my son Chip's books.

409
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:27,585
They're your wife's.
We checked.

410
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,650
She bought them at the...

411
00:30:29,727 --> 00:30:31,456
"Browse and Learn Bookshop"...

412
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:33,190
along with a few other titles.

413
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:35,255
"Helter Skelter,"
"Hunting Humans. "

414
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,858
MasterCard reference
number 7876...

415
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:39,699
dated February fifth.

416
00:30:40,705 --> 00:30:42,605
This is ridiculous!

417
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:45,643
Doctor Sutphin,
is your wife mental?

418
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:50,380
Damn these gnats!

419
00:30:50,448 --> 00:30:51,972
I hate them!

420
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:54,314
Always something, isn't it?
Can I help you?

421
00:30:56,287 --> 00:30:58,517
Thanks for not buying anything.

422
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:00,490
Misty, honey...

423
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:01,820
now, lighten up.

424
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:04,885
It's not the customer's fault
that Carl stood you up.

425
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:18,641
Young man,
this Faberge egg is chipped.

426
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,041
Yes, ma'am, it is.

427
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:22,079
I'll give you fifty dollars.

428
00:31:22,146 --> 00:31:23,977
That's a Franklin Mint piece.

429
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:25,777
One hundred dollars.

430
00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:30,083
Franklin Mint or not,
that's damaged goods.

431
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:51,203
- I'll take this instead.
- This is a nice one, huh?

432
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:53,403
It'll be cold before you know it.

433
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,039
Three dollars?

434
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:58,480
I guess that's
how I must have marked it.

435
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,760
Did you find your Franklin Mint egg,
Rosemary darling?

436
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:14,855
I saw one, but it was
really overpriced.

437
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:17,457
Want me to keep this
under the table for you?

438
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:19,901
If you don't mind.
It was on sale.

439
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:27,537
Franklin Mint!

440
00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:36,316
Honey, please...

441
00:32:36,387 --> 00:32:38,446
for my bedroom shelf.

442
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:42,416
Wrap it up for the little lady.

443
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:44,961
Here you go.

444
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:17,884
The Colts.

445
00:33:17,962 --> 00:33:19,452
Banner, please.

446
00:33:22,867 --> 00:33:25,461
Honey, I have to take a piss.

447
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,828
There you go.

448
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:10,465
Can't believe it.
Fuckin' Don Knotts!

449
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:12,202
He's the coolest.

450
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:15,068
Honey, look.

451
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:16,807
I made a killing.

452
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,551
Mom, watch the booth.
I want to see what's going on.

453
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:33,119
Sure.

454
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:37,858
I hope nothing's wrong.

455
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:40,999
You got some doo-doo
on your shoe.

456
00:35:47,778 --> 00:35:49,370
I hate that!

457
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:55,219
There was a lady
in the men's room, I swear!

458
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:57,220
A pretty little lady
in the stall right next to me.

459
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:29,845
That's $158.

460
00:36:30,254 --> 00:36:32,245
New York money
good enough for you?

461
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,423
Certainly.

462
00:36:39,997 --> 00:36:41,362
It's Carl.

463
00:36:41,432 --> 00:36:42,899
He's dead.

464
00:36:43,434 --> 00:36:44,833
How horrible.

465
00:36:44,902 --> 00:36:46,893
I just sold
the Pee-Wee Herman doll.

466
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:49,097
Didn't you hear me?

467
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:51,164
Someone murdered Carl
in the men's room.

468
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:52,971
I just saw his dead body!

469
00:36:55,012 --> 00:36:57,003
You got your wish, dear.

470
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,846
I didn't wish that.

471
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:03,554
I didn't want him dead.

472
00:37:59,377 --> 00:38:01,436
Beverly, it's me, Ted Bundy.

473
00:38:01,512 --> 00:38:04,208
It's late at night,
six days before my execution...

474
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:06,876
and it's lonely
here on Death Row.

475
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,420
Updating the story
of the hour...

476
00:38:10,488 --> 00:38:12,456
the young man brutally murdered
a short time ago...

477
00:38:12,523 --> 00:38:14,753
in the men's room
of the Antique Trader's Mart...

478
00:38:14,825 --> 00:38:18,693
has been identified as 22-year-old
Carl Pageant of Towson.

479
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:48,719
Our mother is Charles Manson!

480
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:51,552
I'm not kidding.

481
00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:53,290
Carl stood me up this morning...

482
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:55,161
and then he was murdered
at the flea market.

483
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:56,221
Murdered?

484
00:38:57,301 --> 00:39:00,270
You said you hated your teacher,
and he was murdered too.

485
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,431
I don't know.
Maybe Mom's nuts!

486
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:04,235
That's a cool idea, Misty.

487
00:39:04,308 --> 00:39:06,503
Let's make a gore movie
about Mom.

488
00:39:06,577 --> 00:39:08,568
Better yet, a TV series.

489
00:39:09,213 --> 00:39:11,238
Can I borrow your mother?
My aunt's coming over for dinner...

490
00:39:11,315 --> 00:39:13,374
and she's always
getting on my nerves.

491
00:39:13,451 --> 00:39:15,442
My stepfather's an asshole.
She could kill him.

492
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:17,783
How about Mrs. Ackerman?
We all hate her.

493
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:19,823
Who's gonna be
the next victim?

494
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:21,858
Stop it!

495
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:23,359
It's not funny!

496
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:24,985
Mom might do it.

497
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:28,398
Somebody else might die!

498
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:34,134
Dinner is served.

499
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:37,370
Let's say grace...

500
00:39:37,441 --> 00:39:39,272
and pray for the strength
to understand...

501
00:39:39,343 --> 00:39:41,937
the terrible tragedies
of the last few days.

502
00:39:42,012 --> 00:39:43,411
Amen to that.

503
00:39:44,281 --> 00:39:47,580
It's been a crazy day,
hasn't it?

504
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:54,052
Bless, O Lord, this food to our use
and ourself to Thy service.

505
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:55,251
Amen.

506
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:01,057
Hungry, honey?

507
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:04,397
Dottie Hinkle was right.
It is Beverly Sutphin.

508
00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:08,404
I saw blood right there
on the bottom of her shoes.

509
00:40:08,472 --> 00:40:09,962
Not exactly blood.

510
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:14,306
It was gore,
hanging there like a runny nose!

511
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:19,214
Nice as pie she was to me,
and then I hear her say it.

512
00:40:19,283 --> 00:40:20,580
Say what, ma'am?

513
00:40:21,786 --> 00:40:23,310
"Are those-"

514
00:40:23,387 --> 00:40:25,878
I can't say the word out loud.

515
00:40:25,956 --> 00:40:28,049
Could you tell a policewoman
the exact words she used?

516
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:29,558
Maybe.

517
00:40:32,963 --> 00:40:35,022
It's okay.
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

518
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:37,090
Come on. Let it out.

519
00:40:37,334 --> 00:40:40,098
"Pussy. " That's what she said to me.
"Pussy willows. "

520
00:40:47,044 --> 00:40:48,375
You know, Mom...

521
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,741
Scotty thinks you're the killer.

522
00:40:53,984 --> 00:40:55,144
Does he?

523
00:40:55,853 --> 00:40:57,684
For someone who doesn't wear
his seat belt...

524
00:40:57,755 --> 00:40:59,450
Scotty sure is nosy!

525
00:41:03,093 --> 00:41:04,560
Just a second.

526
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,391
She's gone!

527
00:41:46,871 --> 00:41:48,498
She's gonna kill Scotty!

528
00:41:48,572 --> 00:41:50,005
Get in the car, both of you.

529
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:51,871
You don't think she did it,
do you?

530
00:41:51,942 --> 00:41:54,137
I do. Mom's gone crazy!

531
00:41:54,211 --> 00:41:56,771
Your mother may have
some problems, that's all.

532
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:58,144
Come on. Hurry!

533
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,334
Detective Gracey
and all units...

534
00:42:21,405 --> 00:42:24,135
suspect's family headed east
on Calverton.

535
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:26,642
Repeat: east on Calverton.

536
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,109
Turn right on Timonium Road.

537
00:42:28,178 --> 00:42:29,839
- I will.
- Hurry!

538
00:43:10,321 --> 00:43:13,882
If Mom's psycho, Scotty will
still be okay, won't he?

539
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:16,415
We hope so, son.

540
00:43:17,194 --> 00:43:20,459
And no matter what your mother is,
we'll love her anyway.

541
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:30,160
This is Scotty's, Dad.

542
00:44:30,234 --> 00:44:32,259
His parents aren't home.
Come on.

543
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:57,024
What was that?

544
00:44:57,895 --> 00:44:59,385
I didn't hear anything.

545
00:45:00,964 --> 00:45:04,297
- Got any dessert?
- Dr. Sutphin said no sweets for you.

546
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:09,533
- What's he know?
- How to send a bill.

547
00:45:15,779 --> 00:45:17,440
I'll get the door.

548
00:45:18,816 --> 00:45:20,750
Suspect's family entering house.

549
00:45:20,818 --> 00:45:22,945
Send backup
to 400 Sycamore Street.

550
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:25,011
I have a feeling
old Mom's inside.

551
00:45:31,595 --> 00:45:33,256
Wheel...

552
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:34,797
Of...

553
00:45:34,865 --> 00:45:37,095
Fortune.

554
00:45:38,035 --> 00:45:40,196
Bill, "Wheel of Fortune" is on.

555
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:42,101
I'm still eatin'.

556
00:46:15,973 --> 00:46:18,203
Come on up, honey.

557
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:20,266
Before the kids get home.

558
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:32,949
- Ralph.
- What is it, Betty?

559
00:46:33,023 --> 00:46:35,423
I think we got mice
or something.

560
00:46:35,492 --> 00:46:37,483
No, we paid the exterminator.

561
00:47:02,186 --> 00:47:03,847
It's upstairs.

562
00:47:06,023 --> 00:47:08,014
I'm going in. Over.

563
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:14,420
It's the door on the left.

564
00:47:19,536 --> 00:47:21,026
Break it down!

565
00:47:25,976 --> 00:47:28,444
Police! Freeze!

566
00:47:32,816 --> 00:47:34,477
Betty, answer me!

567
00:47:51,501 --> 00:47:53,662
Help, police!

568
00:47:53,737 --> 00:47:55,728
Help me, please!

569
00:47:57,608 --> 00:47:59,041
Police!

570
00:48:01,945 --> 00:48:03,435
Help me, somebody!

571
00:48:13,657 --> 00:48:16,717
Home, sweet home.
Everything's fine, kids.

572
00:48:16,793 --> 00:48:19,956
I can't believe I thought
my own mother was a murderess.

573
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:21,657
I'm kind of disappointed
she isn't.

574
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:23,757
For a while it was like
being in the movies.

575
00:48:23,834 --> 00:48:26,029
Anybody for dessert?

576
00:48:26,103 --> 00:48:27,730
Strawberries.

577
00:48:45,222 --> 00:48:46,553
Let's go.

578
00:49:18,822 --> 00:49:20,813
Dad, you said
it would be okay.

579
00:49:20,891 --> 00:49:22,882
Make them go away.
This is embarrassing!

580
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,655
Just pay no attention
to the police.

581
00:49:24,728 --> 00:49:26,525
It's all a terrible mistake.

582
00:49:26,596 --> 00:49:28,996
Do you think
we'll get on "A Current Affair"?

583
00:49:35,205 --> 00:49:38,641
Sutphin family proceeding west
on Seminary Avenue. Over.

584
00:49:39,409 --> 00:49:41,536
Beverly ain't goin' nowhere
this time!

585
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:54,948
She's headed for church.

586
00:49:55,392 --> 00:49:58,520
- I say we nail her. Over.
- Negative.

587
00:49:58,595 --> 00:50:00,529
D.A. says no bust
until lab report is back...

588
00:50:00,597 --> 00:50:03,464
matching suspect's fingerprints
on "True Crime" books...

589
00:50:03,533 --> 00:50:05,797
with those on scissors
and fire poker.

590
00:50:05,902 --> 00:50:07,597
The senseless killing last night...

591
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:10,003
of a Towson couple,
Ralph and Betty Sterner...

592
00:50:10,073 --> 00:50:11,768
brings to a total of four murders...

593
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:14,174
police feel may have been
committed by Baltimore's...

594
00:50:14,244 --> 00:50:16,337
first serial killer.

595
00:50:17,214 --> 00:50:18,238
Beverly!

596
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:20,745
Not the Sterners!

597
00:50:20,817 --> 00:50:23,377
It's a shame! But they should have
brushed their teeth, shouldn't they?

598
00:50:24,488 --> 00:50:26,353
This just in:
Police Lieutenant Ronald Hadler...

599
00:50:26,423 --> 00:50:28,015
has publicly named a suspect...

600
00:50:28,091 --> 00:50:30,992
in the serial killer case,
and it's a shocker!

601
00:50:31,061 --> 00:50:34,394
She- that's right, she-
has been identified as...

602
00:50:34,464 --> 00:50:37,160
- Beverly R. Sutphin-
- Oh, really!

603
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:43,596
God! Now I'll never
get a boyfriend!

604
00:50:43,673 --> 00:50:46,335
Beverly, I've read
all about this.

605
00:50:47,277 --> 00:50:48,938
Is it menopause?

606
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:53,113
Tell me the truth, Mom.
Really, it's okay with me.

607
00:50:53,183 --> 00:50:54,844
Are you a serial killer?

608
00:50:54,918 --> 00:50:59,355
The only cereal I know anything
about is Rice Krispies!

609
00:51:08,765 --> 00:51:11,563
Don't worry. We're gonna get you
good psychiatric help.

610
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:38,655
Well, look at that!

611
00:51:38,728 --> 00:51:40,958
And in the house of God!

612
00:51:47,804 --> 00:51:49,135
Gus, Sloppy, hi.

613
00:51:52,642 --> 00:51:54,473
- Hey, what's up, Birdie?
- We said no, remember?

614
00:51:54,544 --> 00:51:57,843
Please, you can't talk to him.

615
00:51:57,914 --> 00:52:00,144
Stay with us, son.

616
00:52:00,217 --> 00:52:03,311
She's awful!
She can't stay here!

617
00:52:03,386 --> 00:52:04,944
Good morning, ladies.

618
00:52:08,725 --> 00:52:10,955
So, tell me, Mrs. Sutphin,
are you "Serial Mom"?

619
00:52:11,027 --> 00:52:12,858
- What?
- No comment!

620
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:15,090
"Serial Mom"?

621
00:52:16,733 --> 00:52:19,293
She's headed in. Over.

622
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:58,668
Please stand.

623
00:53:02,712 --> 00:53:06,648
Blessed be God,
Father, Son and Holy Spirit.

624
00:53:06,716 --> 00:53:08,479
And blessed be His kingdom...

625
00:53:08,552 --> 00:53:11,544
now and forever, amen.

626
00:53:11,621 --> 00:53:12,883
Alleluia!

627
00:53:12,956 --> 00:53:14,617
Christ is risen.

628
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:16,420
The Lord is risen indeed.

629
00:53:18,562 --> 00:53:21,360
Bless the Lord,
who forgiveth all our sins.

630
00:53:21,765 --> 00:53:23,494
This is Captain Lueker
from homicide.

631
00:53:23,567 --> 00:53:26,434
Lab reports confirm Sutphin
latent print of index finger...

632
00:53:26,503 --> 00:53:30,337
on "True Crime" books matches
those lifted from murder weapon.

633
00:53:30,407 --> 00:53:32,637
Bingo, boys!
Bust the bitch!

634
00:53:33,243 --> 00:53:34,835
Copy.

635
00:53:39,816 --> 00:53:42,979
Jesus said nothing
to condemn capital punishment...

636
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:45,044
as He hung on the cross...

637
00:53:45,121 --> 00:53:46,611
did He?

638
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:50,817
If ever there was a time
to go on record...

639
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:54,694
against the death penalty,
wasn't it that night?

640
00:53:56,466 --> 00:53:58,934
Capital punishment
is already the law...

641
00:53:59,002 --> 00:54:01,436
in the state of Maryland.

642
00:54:01,504 --> 00:54:03,404
So what are we waiting for...

643
00:54:03,473 --> 00:54:04,906
fellow Christians?

644
00:54:04,975 --> 00:54:07,034
Let's just do it.

645
00:54:11,448 --> 00:54:13,507
- How ya doin'?
- All standing.

646
00:54:15,785 --> 00:54:18,879
Let us pray
and humbly confess our sins...

647
00:54:18,955 --> 00:54:20,923
unto Almighty God.

648
00:54:20,991 --> 00:54:22,754
Most merciful God...

649
00:54:22,826 --> 00:54:24,726
we confess that we have sinned...

650
00:54:24,794 --> 00:54:27,627
against Thee
by what we have done...

651
00:54:27,697 --> 00:54:30,666
and by what we have left undone.

652
00:54:30,734 --> 00:54:32,634
We are truly sorry...

653
00:54:32,702 --> 00:54:35,193
and we humbly repent...

654
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:38,400
so that we may delight
in Thy will...

655
00:54:38,475 --> 00:54:42,741
and walk in Thy ways
to the glory of Thy name.

656
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:10,632
There she is!

657
00:55:18,715 --> 00:55:21,809
- Scotty's car. Come on!
- Mrs. Sutphin, hurry!

658
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:29,451
We'll show 'em, Mom.
We'll go on "60 Minutes. "

659
00:55:31,261 --> 00:55:33,252
You're bigger than Freddy
and Jason now...

660
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:35,093
only you're a real person!

661
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:37,190
Do you think I need a lawyer?

662
00:55:37,267 --> 00:55:40,065
You need an agent!

663
00:55:54,584 --> 00:55:56,575
- Is your wife a murderess?
- No comment!

664
00:55:56,653 --> 00:55:59,247
Please, my wife is missing.
I'm worried sick about her.

665
00:56:00,557 --> 00:56:02,388
Just a couple of shots, okay?

666
00:56:02,459 --> 00:56:04,450
I'm Howell Hawkins
from the "Baltimore Sun. "

667
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:08,357
Misty Sutphin,
get in this car!

668
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:29,708
We're tailing Sutphin
husband and daughter...

669
00:56:29,786 --> 00:56:31,777
but "Serial Mom"
is nowhere in sight.

670
00:56:31,855 --> 00:56:34,187
She got away, boys.
Goddamn it, find her!

671
00:56:35,158 --> 00:56:36,989
- In here, Mom.
- But Chip!

672
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,721
Come on, Mom,
I have to open.

673
00:56:38,795 --> 00:56:40,763
Now, this is so silly!

674
00:56:42,332 --> 00:56:43,822
Customers. Get the door.

675
00:56:48,138 --> 00:56:49,833
Good morning, Mrs. Jenson.

676
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:03,580
Haven't you had enough violence,
Chip Sutphin?

677
00:57:03,653 --> 00:57:07,453
- Turn that filth off.
- Sorry, ma'am.

678
00:57:07,524 --> 00:57:09,515
Do you have the musical
"Annie"?

679
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:11,526
Sure do.

680
00:57:12,228 --> 00:57:14,458
Did you bring back
"Ghost Dad"?

681
00:57:14,531 --> 00:57:16,158
Here you go.

682
00:57:16,232 --> 00:57:18,928
I just love Bill Cosby pictures.

683
00:57:19,002 --> 00:57:21,061
Mrs. Jenson, I've told you:

684
00:57:21,137 --> 00:57:23,731
You have to rewind the tapes
before returning them.

685
00:57:23,807 --> 00:57:24,967
Why?

686
00:57:25,041 --> 00:57:27,100
Because it's the rules.

687
00:57:27,177 --> 00:57:28,906
I don't feel like rewinding them.

688
00:57:30,013 --> 00:57:31,480
You see that sign?

689
00:57:31,548 --> 00:57:33,516
It's a dollar fine
for not rewinding...

690
00:57:33,583 --> 00:57:35,551
and this time
I'm gonna charge you.

691
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:38,143
$2.99 plus one dollar...

692
00:57:38,221 --> 00:57:39,916
is $3.99.

693
00:57:40,423 --> 00:57:43,620
Keep the change,
you son of a psycho!

694
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:45,827
What a bitch!

695
00:57:45,895 --> 00:57:48,386
It's the influence
of all those family films.

696
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:49,898
Right, Mom?

697
00:57:51,668 --> 00:57:54,000
- Mom?
- Mrs. Sutphin?

698
00:57:59,008 --> 00:58:00,908
Oh, shit!

699
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:02,308
- You don't think-
- She wouldn't!

700
00:58:02,378 --> 00:58:04,471
What's Mrs. Jenson's address?

701
00:58:04,547 --> 00:58:07,948
Jenkins- Jenson.
Emmy Lou Jenson, 19 Clark Avenue.

702
00:58:08,017 --> 00:58:10,952
That's right up the street.
Come on, just in case.

703
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:14,256
Come on, Birdie. Let's go.

704
00:59:00,937 --> 00:59:03,235
What is it, Sylvester?
A birdie?

705
00:59:03,306 --> 00:59:04,568
Shh.

706
00:59:04,641 --> 00:59:07,940
Mommy's watching "Annie. "

707
00:59:15,084 --> 00:59:17,143
Quiet, Sylvester.

708
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:18,482
Nobody's there.

709
00:59:20,857 --> 00:59:25,021
Come on. Lick Mommy's feet.
Get them all wet!

710
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:32,667
Come on!

711
00:59:36,506 --> 00:59:38,770
- Number 19.
- That's it.

712
00:59:38,841 --> 00:59:40,775
Come on.

713
00:59:45,315 --> 00:59:47,783
Over here.
Chip, over here.

714
00:59:55,525 --> 00:59:57,459
Come on.

715
01:00:18,214 --> 01:00:21,183
Get up there.
Is she in there?

716
01:00:43,072 --> 01:00:45,097
She's singing "Annie. "

717
01:01:30,386 --> 01:01:31,546
Rewind!

718
01:02:06,322 --> 01:02:07,721
Oh, my God!

719
01:02:12,695 --> 01:02:16,688
I saw blood, and it's brown!
It's not red, like in the horror movies!

720
01:02:16,766 --> 01:02:18,996
- Was Mom in there?
- No!

721
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:23,732
It wasn't like those gore movies
at all! It was real.

722
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:38,011
Come on. Cut through here.

723
01:02:49,132 --> 01:02:51,600
Wear your seat belt!

724
01:02:52,535 --> 01:02:54,366
It's a law!

725
01:03:04,914 --> 01:03:06,882
- Out, please.
- What the fuck-

726
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:08,940
Yes, ma'am.

727
01:03:22,431 --> 01:03:26,595
Dear God, I promise I'll never watch
another sex film again.

728
01:03:26,669 --> 01:03:29,001
I promise, I promise!

729
01:04:03,272 --> 01:04:04,603
Dad!

730
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:10,202
- Have you seen Mom?
- No. Have you?

731
01:04:18,187 --> 01:04:19,518
Oh, my God!

732
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:22,118
Get in!

733
01:04:39,008 --> 01:04:42,171
All units, Serial Mom's headed south
on Keswick. Proceed with caution.

734
01:04:42,245 --> 01:04:44,509
She is armed
and fucking nuts!

735
01:05:02,198 --> 01:05:04,428
Oh, shit!

736
01:05:30,026 --> 01:05:32,290
Let me in!

737
01:05:32,361 --> 01:05:34,454
- I.D.!
- Can I give it to you inside?

738
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:36,623
Nobody gets in without I.D.

739
01:05:39,235 --> 01:05:43,467
- Birth date?
- December 14, 1972.

740
01:05:43,539 --> 01:05:46,167
- Please!
- Okay, go ahead.

741
01:06:16,272 --> 01:06:18,638
Excuse me. Excuse me.

742
01:06:18,708 --> 01:06:21,142
- Hey, look, it's her.
- Who?

743
01:06:21,210 --> 01:06:23,337
It's the murder lady,
the one on TV.

744
01:06:23,412 --> 01:06:25,346
Cool. Is she in a band?

745
01:06:41,597 --> 01:06:44,760
The police are after me.
I better get going.

746
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:48,031
Hey, you're Serial Mom.

747
01:06:48,104 --> 01:06:50,265
Yes, I guess I am.

748
01:06:50,339 --> 01:06:51,863
Come on in, lady, quick.

749
01:07:01,117 --> 01:07:03,210
Coming through. Thank you.

750
01:07:13,062 --> 01:07:17,294
Excuse me, please.
Watch it there. Thank you.

751
01:07:24,306 --> 01:07:26,831
I think maybe
you better lock the car.

752
01:07:26,909 --> 01:07:28,877
- Can't stop now.
- Is my mom in there?

753
01:07:28,944 --> 01:07:30,536
Dad, look cool.
It's Hammerjacks.

754
01:07:34,583 --> 01:07:36,847
Excuse me.

755
01:07:40,156 --> 01:07:42,021
Kids, put me down!

756
01:07:53,769 --> 01:07:55,236
Put me down!

757
01:08:17,026 --> 01:08:19,119
Buckle up, Scotty.

758
01:08:22,731 --> 01:08:25,393
Mrs. Sutphin,
I'll wear my seat belt!

759
01:08:32,041 --> 01:08:33,770
Holy fucking shit!

760
01:09:00,002 --> 01:09:01,264
Hi.

761
01:09:11,347 --> 01:09:14,407
Move it! You're under arrest!

762
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:20,154
- Honey.
- Shut up.

763
01:09:39,508 --> 01:09:41,840
Serial Mom! Serial Mom!

764
01:10:00,696 --> 01:10:04,063
- Please, just let us through.
- Do you believe your wife's innocent?

765
01:10:04,133 --> 01:10:06,328
- She is!
- How does it feel to have a killer mom?

766
01:10:06,402 --> 01:10:08,927
Mr. Sutphin,
how does your wife feel?

767
01:10:09,004 --> 01:10:11,495
Beverly is devastated
by the charges against her.

768
01:10:20,683 --> 01:10:22,173
Didn't I see you at Hinckley?

769
01:10:22,251 --> 01:10:24,082
- I was there.
- I thought so.

770
01:10:24,153 --> 01:10:26,485
- My husband thought I was crazy.
- She is.

771
01:10:26,555 --> 01:10:29,922
Today we're covering day one
of the trial of Serial Mom-

772
01:10:29,992 --> 01:10:32,620
Here they come.

773
01:10:32,695 --> 01:10:36,825
"Stop the violence"? What is this?
Who are you working for?

774
01:10:44,139 --> 01:10:46,664
Quiet in the courtroom.
This court is now in session.

775
01:10:50,613 --> 01:10:54,549
Oh, hello, jury people.
I'm Beverly Sutphin. I like your jacket.

776
01:10:54,617 --> 01:10:58,053
Mrs. Sutphin, I said quiet.

777
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:01,521
Honey, hi. Oh, kids,
are you doing your homework?

778
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:04,559
You are accused
of multiple murders.

779
01:11:04,627 --> 01:11:06,686
This is a court of law,
not a coffee klatch.

780
01:11:06,762 --> 01:11:10,163
Mr. Nazlerod,
your opening statement.

781
01:11:10,232 --> 01:11:12,462
Thank you, Your Honor.

782
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:17,967
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen of
the jury. My name is Timothy Nazlerod...

783
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:20,031
and I hope we can be friends.

784
01:11:21,710 --> 01:11:26,340
I have to tell you at the outset
that this is not a pretty case.

785
01:11:26,415 --> 01:11:29,248
This defendant, Beverly Sutphin...

786
01:11:29,318 --> 01:11:31,309
is a woman evil to the core.

787
01:11:31,387 --> 01:11:33,912
A rotten apple, if you will...

788
01:11:33,989 --> 01:11:36,321
who, beyond any reasonable doubt...

789
01:11:36,392 --> 01:11:39,418
killed six innocent people.

790
01:11:39,495 --> 01:11:42,487
That's right.
She murdered them.

791
01:11:42,564 --> 01:11:44,862
Well, they sort of deserved it.

792
01:11:44,933 --> 01:11:49,734
Evilly and with full premeditation,
with a speeding car...

793
01:11:49,805 --> 01:11:51,898
a fire poker...

794
01:11:51,974 --> 01:11:54,135
a pair of scissors...

795
01:11:54,209 --> 01:11:56,871
a toppled air conditioner...

796
01:11:56,945 --> 01:11:59,914
the lethal flames
from an aerosol can...

797
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:02,143
and, yes...

798
01:12:02,217 --> 01:12:04,651
even a leg of lamb.

799
01:12:06,889 --> 01:12:10,086
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury...

800
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:12,525
this defendant...

801
01:12:12,594 --> 01:12:14,653
this Beverly Sutphin...

802
01:12:14,730 --> 01:12:16,789
she is not a woman.

803
01:12:17,866 --> 01:12:20,027
She is a monster.

804
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:25,064
Defense attorney,
your opening statement for the jury.

805
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:27,074
And let's not take
all day, either.

806
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:34,544
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm Herbie Hebden.

807
01:12:34,616 --> 01:12:37,084
And you and I have
a tough job ahead of us.

808
01:12:37,152 --> 01:12:41,020
I've known the Sutphin family
for 16 years.

809
01:12:41,090 --> 01:12:44,082
Dad- Eugene- He's my dentist.

810
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:47,526
Chip and Misty
played with my own children.

811
01:12:47,596 --> 01:12:51,123
But I found out that
I don't know Beverly Sutphin at all.

812
01:12:53,268 --> 01:12:56,999
No one really knows
Beverly Sutphin. You see-

813
01:13:07,783 --> 01:13:09,808
Beverly Sutphin is insane.

814
01:13:09,885 --> 01:13:14,481
She committed these terrible crimes,
but that doesn't make her a bad person.

815
01:13:14,556 --> 01:13:17,081
Your Honor, I would like
to make a motion.

816
01:13:17,159 --> 01:13:20,890
I wish to fire my attorney
and defend myself.

817
01:13:20,963 --> 01:13:24,922
Beverly Sutphin is not guilty
by reason of insanity.

818
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,492
Your Honor, I have the right to defend
myself. I've read the law books.

819
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:31,562
Ware vs. State, 1964...

820
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:35,235
and Chuwet vs. State, 1962.

821
01:13:35,310 --> 01:13:38,108
Mrs. Sutphin, the defendant
who has herself for a lawyer...

822
01:13:38,180 --> 01:13:39,647
has a fool for a client.

823
01:13:41,283 --> 01:13:43,012
Counsel, approach the bench.

824
01:13:45,854 --> 01:13:47,845
I don't think
this is a good idea.

825
01:13:47,923 --> 01:13:50,084
Oh, yeah?
No, it's okay.

826
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:52,992
That's my ruling.
Thank you very much.

827
01:13:53,061 --> 01:13:56,462
Mrs. Sutphin,
I have no legal choice...

828
01:13:56,532 --> 01:13:58,432
but to let you take over
as your own attorney.

829
01:14:00,235 --> 01:14:02,601
How do you plead?

830
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:07,607
Not guilty, Your Honor.

831
01:14:07,676 --> 01:14:09,439
Order! Order in the courtroom!

832
01:14:10,712 --> 01:14:13,374
Quiet down or
I'll clear this room out.

833
01:14:13,449 --> 01:14:16,418
I call to the stand...

834
01:14:16,485 --> 01:14:18,419
Dottie Hinkle.

835
01:14:31,967 --> 01:14:36,028
Raise your right hand, please.
Do you solemnly swear...

836
01:14:36,104 --> 01:14:39,562
that the testimony you are about to give
will be the whole truth?

837
01:14:39,641 --> 01:14:41,905
- I do.
- Thank you.

838
01:14:43,078 --> 01:14:47,242
Mrs. Hinkle, did you ever receive
any obscene telephone calls?

839
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:48,874
I certainly did.

840
01:14:48,951 --> 01:14:51,545
And did you recognize
the voice of the caller?

841
01:14:51,620 --> 01:14:56,557
Not at first. But then I heard the same
inflection in a voice at a gathering...

842
01:14:56,625 --> 01:14:58,650
and I put two and two together.

843
01:15:00,095 --> 01:15:02,086
Whose voice was it, Dottie?

844
01:15:02,164 --> 01:15:05,133
It was her, Beverly Sutphin...

845
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:06,690
sitting there.

846
01:15:06,768 --> 01:15:08,736
I'm lucky I'm not dead.

847
01:15:15,344 --> 01:15:19,007
- Mrs. Hinkle, do you drink?
- No, I don't.

848
01:15:19,081 --> 01:15:21,481
So you were not drunk
when you received...

849
01:15:21,550 --> 01:15:24,610
those allegedly obscene
phone calls?

850
01:15:24,686 --> 01:15:26,779
I certainly was not.

851
01:15:26,855 --> 01:15:29,323
You mean to tell me the day
I came over to Mrs. Ackerman's...

852
01:15:29,391 --> 01:15:32,827
the day you claim
you recognized my voice...

853
01:15:32,895 --> 01:15:34,522
you were not drinking?

854
01:15:34,596 --> 01:15:37,531
One beer with lunch
is hardly drinking.

855
01:15:39,635 --> 01:15:40,795
So you do drink?

856
01:15:40,869 --> 01:15:43,303
Socially, I'll have a beer.

857
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:46,466
So you admit you just lied?

858
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:49,010
No, I don't, you bitch!

859
01:15:49,077 --> 01:15:50,408
Watch your mouth.

860
01:15:53,649 --> 01:15:57,210
Did you see that?
She just said "Fuck you" to me.

861
01:15:57,286 --> 01:16:00,221
Let the record show
I am merely standing here.

862
01:16:00,289 --> 01:16:01,916
Fuck you too, you whore.

863
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:04,754
I'm warning you, Mrs. Hinkle.
One more obscenity...

864
01:16:04,826 --> 01:16:08,387
and I'm gonna charge you
with contempt of court!

865
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:12,424
Are you insane?

866
01:16:12,501 --> 01:16:14,492
No, I'm not, you motherfucker!

867
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:18,028
Mrs. Hinkle, I find you guilty
of contempt...

868
01:16:18,106 --> 01:16:21,735
and I sentence you to $1,000 fine
and five days in jail.

869
01:16:21,810 --> 01:16:23,641
You cocksucker!

870
01:16:23,712 --> 01:16:25,942
You lousy pig fucker!

871
01:16:26,014 --> 01:16:28,482
You bitch!
You ugly whore!

872
01:16:33,789 --> 01:16:36,519
Come on. They're going quickly.
Serial Mom T-shirts. Get them here.

873
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:39,425
Twelve dollars while they last,
plus tax. MasterCard or Visa.

874
01:16:39,494 --> 01:16:42,429
- I'll take two.
- All right, ma'am.

875
01:16:42,497 --> 01:16:45,864
I wish they'd had this
at the Kennedy kid trial.

876
01:16:45,934 --> 01:16:48,459
Sign right here.
Signature and home phone.

877
01:16:48,537 --> 01:16:53,201
You read it in the paper. Serial Mom-
she's Beverly Sutphin and she's my mom.

878
01:16:53,275 --> 01:16:56,403
You tell Geraldo to go to hell.

879
01:16:56,478 --> 01:17:00,209
I don't care what Jeffrey MacDonald's
people got. He's old news.

880
01:17:00,282 --> 01:17:02,773
We fly first class
or we don't do the show.

881
01:17:02,851 --> 01:17:06,309
- Are you Chip Sutphin?
- Hold on a sec.

882
01:17:06,388 --> 01:17:10,449
Yeah, I am, but you're gonna
have to speak with my agent.

883
01:17:10,525 --> 01:17:13,119
Your mom killed my brother.

884
01:17:13,195 --> 01:17:14,560
Come on!

885
01:17:15,797 --> 01:17:19,164
God! Geez, man!

886
01:17:19,234 --> 01:17:23,227
That's cool.
It's cool, all right?

887
01:17:23,305 --> 01:17:26,536
- You're Carl's brother, right?
- That's right.

888
01:17:26,608 --> 01:17:28,906
I'm sorry he's dead.

889
01:17:28,977 --> 01:17:32,936
- But have you signed off yet?
- TV or print?

890
01:17:33,015 --> 01:17:37,076
TV, man. Suzanne Somers is interested
in playing my mom.

891
01:17:38,387 --> 01:17:41,356
Who's gonna play my brother?

892
01:17:41,423 --> 01:17:43,414
I wonder if Jason Priestley's
available.

893
01:17:44,726 --> 01:17:47,991
Miss Hodges, could you
describe the car?

894
01:17:49,297 --> 01:17:53,529
The one you saw run over Mr. Stubbins
in cold blood.

895
01:17:53,602 --> 01:17:55,160
I seen that movie.

896
01:17:55,237 --> 01:17:56,829
It was on cable.

897
01:17:58,807 --> 01:18:01,241
Please, Miss Hodges.

898
01:18:01,309 --> 01:18:02,936
Could you-

899
01:18:03,011 --> 01:18:05,036
Could you describe it?

900
01:18:07,949 --> 01:18:10,247
Excuse me.

901
01:18:10,318 --> 01:18:14,550
Look, man. Like I told you,
it was blue.

902
01:18:14,623 --> 01:18:17,717
The car, not the driver.

903
01:18:21,196 --> 01:18:23,289
Look, it was just blue.

904
01:18:23,365 --> 01:18:24,832
You know...

905
01:18:27,636 --> 01:18:30,298
like blue.

906
01:18:36,978 --> 01:18:39,446
Here you go. Enjoy my book.

907
01:18:39,514 --> 01:18:41,880
Could you sign it
"To a future Serial Mom"?

908
01:18:41,950 --> 01:18:45,442
- Sure. You think she did it?
- I have reasonable doubt.

909
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:48,580
I feel like killing
a couple of people myself.

910
01:18:48,657 --> 01:18:50,249
Eight dollars, ma'am.

911
01:18:50,325 --> 01:18:53,419
And these books,
these disgusting books...

912
01:18:53,495 --> 01:18:57,795
that so lovingly describe
the sadistic acts of serial killers...

913
01:18:57,866 --> 01:19:00,266
where did you find
these books, Detective?

914
01:19:00,335 --> 01:19:03,600
In Beverly Sutphin's trash can.

915
01:19:03,672 --> 01:19:06,140
You may cross-examine,
Mrs. Sutphin.

916
01:19:06,208 --> 01:19:08,733
Thank you.

917
01:19:12,614 --> 01:19:14,377
Detective Gracey?

918
01:19:14,449 --> 01:19:18,078
If I were to look through your trash,
what reading materials would I find?

919
01:19:18,153 --> 01:19:21,020
Objection! Immaterial.

920
01:19:21,089 --> 01:19:22,249
You may answer.

921
01:19:24,426 --> 01:19:26,690
"Time", "Sports lllustrated"...

922
01:19:26,762 --> 01:19:28,252
"National Geographic. "

923
01:19:28,330 --> 01:19:30,127
My wife gets "Ladies' Home Journal. "

924
01:19:30,198 --> 01:19:34,294
Last night we found
in your trash can this magazine...

925
01:19:34,369 --> 01:19:36,360
"Chicks With Dicks. "

926
01:19:44,112 --> 01:19:46,637
Goddamn you.

927
01:19:46,715 --> 01:19:49,707
- That's trespassing!
- Never judge a person...

928
01:19:49,785 --> 01:19:52,049
by what they read, Detective.

929
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:54,452
Your witness, Mr. Nazlerod.

930
01:19:54,523 --> 01:19:58,653
I am a married man!
I hope they give you the gas chamber!

931
01:20:03,765 --> 01:20:06,529
The jury is instructed
to ignore the outburst of the witness.

932
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:11,166
I call to the stand
Rosemary Ackerman.

933
01:20:11,740 --> 01:20:14,834
Now, did you ever see
the fire poker again...

934
01:20:14,910 --> 01:20:17,708
after you left it
with Mrs. Sutphin?

935
01:20:17,779 --> 01:20:20,373
Yes. Thirty minutes later.

936
01:20:20,448 --> 01:20:24,714
It was covered with blood and gore,
and Carl Pageant was dead.

937
01:20:26,321 --> 01:20:28,152
No further questions.

938
01:20:30,926 --> 01:20:34,157
When you left me at the antique mart,
where did you go?

939
01:20:35,897 --> 01:20:39,663
- Browsing.
- Did Carl buy something you wanted?

940
01:20:39,734 --> 01:20:43,795
I didn't want that Faberge egg.
It was chipped.

941
01:20:43,872 --> 01:20:46,102
Carl Pageant died because of you,
didn't he?

942
01:20:46,174 --> 01:20:50,008
No. I would never hurt anybody.

943
01:20:50,078 --> 01:20:52,308
It was your "Premiere" magazine
with the letters cut out?

944
01:20:52,380 --> 01:20:55,213
Yes, but I lent it to-

945
01:20:55,283 --> 01:20:58,446
And they were your scissors that were
found in Mrs. Sterner's stomach?

946
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:01,011
Yes, but I didn't-

947
01:21:06,795 --> 01:21:09,059
Do you recycle?

948
01:21:22,611 --> 01:21:24,579
I don't have room
in my kitchen.

949
01:21:30,852 --> 01:21:34,117
Detective Pike, did you then proceed
to the stage area in Hammerjacks?

950
01:21:34,189 --> 01:21:38,057
Yes, I did. Scotty Barnhill was on fire
and fell to his knees in flames.

951
01:21:38,126 --> 01:21:39,753
Would this be what you saw?

952
01:21:39,828 --> 01:21:42,058
Yes, sir. A real barbecue.

953
01:21:42,130 --> 01:21:45,657
May I show this photo
to the jury, Your Honor?

954
01:21:45,734 --> 01:21:50,296
- Chip, she's here.
- They're entitled to see her handiwork.

955
01:22:02,550 --> 01:22:04,484
Excuse me.

956
01:22:06,554 --> 01:22:10,046
Your Honor, may the photograph please
be received into evidence...

957
01:22:10,125 --> 01:22:12,389
and shown to the jury?

958
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:14,655
Yes.

959
01:22:16,631 --> 01:22:20,260
Geez, that really is
Suzanne Somers.

960
01:22:21,670 --> 01:22:24,434
Oh, I loved you in
"Three's Company. "

961
01:22:24,506 --> 01:22:26,337
No further questions.

962
01:22:29,544 --> 01:22:32,945
I call to the stand Marvin Pickles.

963
01:22:39,354 --> 01:22:42,050
Mr. Pickles. Mr. Marvin Pickles.

964
01:22:44,059 --> 01:22:46,823
- Be right out.
- The judge is waiting for you.

965
01:22:50,432 --> 01:22:52,366
Come on. Get moving.

966
01:22:56,504 --> 01:22:58,301
State your name, please.

967
01:22:58,373 --> 01:23:00,398
Marvin A. Pickles.

968
01:23:00,475 --> 01:23:03,569
Were you in the men's room
at the Antique Traders' Mart...

969
01:23:03,645 --> 01:23:06,808
on Saturday, May 15?

970
01:23:06,881 --> 01:23:08,849
Yes, I was.

971
01:23:17,492 --> 01:23:20,689
Did you see anyone
in the booth next to you?

972
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:27,434
Excuse me.

973
01:23:27,502 --> 01:23:30,528
Mr. Pickles, did you see
anyone in the booth next to you?

974
01:23:30,605 --> 01:23:32,232
I'm not sure.

975
01:23:35,276 --> 01:23:36,971
What do you mean,
you're not sure?

976
01:23:37,045 --> 01:23:39,036
There was nobody next to me.

977
01:23:39,114 --> 01:23:41,844
Mr. Pickles, didn't you tell
the grand jury...

978
01:23:41,916 --> 01:23:44,714
that you looked down
and you saw a pair of ladies' shoes...

979
01:23:44,786 --> 01:23:46,879
in the booth next to you?

980
01:23:48,089 --> 01:23:50,182
I just said what you told me to.

981
01:23:52,293 --> 01:23:54,955
Perjury is a serious offense,
Mr. Pickles.

982
01:23:58,199 --> 01:23:59,723
I made it all up.

983
01:24:01,302 --> 01:24:04,430
I've never seen Beverly Sutphin
in my life.

984
01:24:04,506 --> 01:24:07,907
You'll pay for this,
Marvin Pickles.

985
01:24:09,844 --> 01:24:12,472
I'm turning your file
over to the vice squad.

986
01:24:18,353 --> 01:24:20,287
The prosecution rests.

987
01:24:26,828 --> 01:24:29,991
The prosecution has proven nothing,
Your Honor.

988
01:24:30,065 --> 01:24:32,499
The defense rests also.

989
01:24:37,639 --> 01:24:41,097
Order. Order in the courtroom.

990
01:24:43,311 --> 01:24:45,541
We'll take a ten-minute recess.

991
01:24:45,613 --> 01:24:48,013
Attorneys, be ready
with your closing arguments.

992
01:24:48,083 --> 01:24:52,543
Well, I feel that Beverly Sutphin
is an innocent woman...

993
01:24:52,620 --> 01:24:54,451
wrongly accused.

994
01:24:54,522 --> 01:24:59,550
A normal housewife trapped in the
nightmare of circumstantial evidence.

995
01:25:04,032 --> 01:25:05,363
There she is.

996
01:25:05,433 --> 01:25:06,923
Henrietta Lee Lucas...

997
01:25:07,001 --> 01:25:09,094
Joan Wayne Gacy.

998
01:25:09,170 --> 01:25:11,035
A new face...

999
01:25:11,106 --> 01:25:14,371
in the deck of serial killer
trading cards.

1000
01:25:16,044 --> 01:25:17,306
Find her guilty...

1001
01:25:17,378 --> 01:25:19,778
on all six counts...

1002
01:25:19,848 --> 01:25:21,782
of first-degree murder.

1003
01:25:21,850 --> 01:25:26,685
I only hope I can portray
Serial Mom's life on the TV screen...

1004
01:25:26,754 --> 01:25:29,416
with the proper dignity...

1005
01:25:29,491 --> 01:25:32,619
that this feminist heroine deserves.

1006
01:25:32,694 --> 01:25:34,992
Look at me.

1007
01:25:35,063 --> 01:25:38,260
I am as normal as all of you.

1008
01:25:40,368 --> 01:25:43,166
But I've been framed
by the police...

1009
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:47,608
and perjured against...

1010
01:25:47,675 --> 01:25:51,076
by the very people
I thought were my friends.

1011
01:25:51,146 --> 01:25:54,115
- All I ask of you...
- Stop that!

1012
01:25:54,182 --> 01:25:56,150
is that you have the courage...

1013
01:25:56,217 --> 01:25:59,448
to find me innocent
of these...

1014
01:25:59,521 --> 01:26:02,547
terribly untrue charges.

1015
01:26:02,624 --> 01:26:06,424
All I ask is that
you find me innocent...

1016
01:26:06,494 --> 01:26:09,895
of these terribly
untrue charges.

1017
01:26:28,483 --> 01:26:31,350
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
have you reached a verdict?

1018
01:26:31,419 --> 01:26:33,944
Yes, we have, Your Honor.

1019
01:26:37,692 --> 01:26:39,057
We find the defendant...

1020
01:26:39,127 --> 01:26:41,789
not guilty of all charges.

1021
01:26:47,602 --> 01:26:49,297
Way to go, Beverly!

1022
01:26:53,474 --> 01:26:55,408
I'm coming home!

1023
01:27:00,949 --> 01:27:02,541
What should I do?

1024
01:27:02,617 --> 01:27:04,983
I don't know.
Bring her home, I guess.

1025
01:27:05,053 --> 01:27:07,385
No more violence.

1026
01:27:07,455 --> 01:27:09,719
You think she'll like me?

1027
01:27:09,791 --> 01:27:11,816
Just be nice to her...

1028
01:27:11,893 --> 01:27:15,351
and try- try not to get
on her nerves.

1029
01:27:19,667 --> 01:27:21,897
She got off innocent!

1030
01:27:21,970 --> 01:27:24,165
Congratulations, Beverly.

1031
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:27,174
- I love you.
- Oh, I love you too.

1032
01:27:27,242 --> 01:27:30,905
Thank you all for coming.
Hi there, L.A.

1033
01:27:31,980 --> 01:27:33,675
Well, hello, New York.

1034
01:27:33,748 --> 01:27:36,216
Beverly, who does your hair?

1035
01:27:38,486 --> 01:27:40,920
Would you hold this for me, honey?

1036
01:27:40,989 --> 01:27:43,457
Excuse me. Mr. Sutphin,
can I ask you a question?

1037
01:27:43,524 --> 01:27:45,583
Did the system work?

1038
01:27:45,660 --> 01:27:47,787
Excuse me.
The rights have been sold.

1039
01:27:47,862 --> 01:27:49,796
We did it. We set her free.

1040
01:27:49,864 --> 01:27:51,957
I knew she was innocent
from the start.

1041
01:27:58,973 --> 01:28:01,567
You can't wear white shoes
after Labor Day.

1042
01:28:01,643 --> 01:28:04,806
- That's not true anymore.
- Yes, it is.

1043
01:28:04,879 --> 01:28:06,972
Didn't your mother
ever tell you?

1044
01:28:08,449 --> 01:28:10,212
Now you know.

1045
01:28:11,819 --> 01:28:16,051
No, please.
Fashion has changed.

1046
01:28:16,124 --> 01:28:17,785
No, it hasn't.

1047
01:28:19,427 --> 01:28:22,123
- Are you surprised?
- No comment.

1048
01:28:23,064 --> 01:28:24,656
Here I am, honey.

1049
01:28:24,732 --> 01:28:27,462
- Beverly, hi. I'm Suzanne Somers.
- Hello!

1050
01:28:27,535 --> 01:28:30,971
Mrs. Sutphin, can we get a shot of you
and Suzanne Somers?

1051
01:28:31,039 --> 01:28:34,304
Absolutely. Stand here.
What about a nice two-shot?

1052
01:28:34,375 --> 01:28:37,367
- No, Suzanne, I'd-
- Beverly, stand right here.

1053
01:28:37,445 --> 01:28:39,379
Okay, smile, Serial Mom.

1054
01:28:39,447 --> 01:28:42,245
Suzanne Somers,
this is my bad side!

1055
01:28:43,245 --> 01:28:53,245
