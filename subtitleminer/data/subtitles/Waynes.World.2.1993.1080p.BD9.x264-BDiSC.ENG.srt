1
00:00:38,812 --> 00:00:41,314
Extreme close-up!

2
00:00:47,821 --> 00:00:49,656
OK. All right.

3
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:53,493
All right. Here we are
in our new surroundings,

4
00:00:53,577 --> 00:00:57,581
the abandoned Acme doll factory
in downtown Aurora, Illinois.

5
00:00:57,664 --> 00:01:01,835
- An official babe lair.
- It'll be chick central.

6
00:01:01,918 --> 00:01:05,547
I feel sorry for guys
who still live with their parents.

7
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:09,176
OK. You've probably noticed
we're on early tonight.

8
00:01:09,301 --> 00:01:13,597
Usually, at this time on Aurora
Cable, you're watching Plant World.

9
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,724
They didn't want our 10:30 time slot.

10
00:01:15,807 --> 00:01:20,228
But we were able to talk Plant World
into changing with Cooking World.

11
00:01:20,312 --> 00:01:22,689
Although they didn't want to change.

12
00:01:22,773 --> 00:01:27,319
Fortunately, White Supremacy World
was cancelled and the trades worked.

13
00:01:27,402 --> 00:01:29,571
Finally, the reason we're on early

14
00:01:29,654 --> 00:01:33,241
is because we're going to a concert
tonight in Chicago.

15
00:01:33,325 --> 00:01:34,785
- Excellent.
- Yes.

16
00:01:34,868 --> 00:01:40,374
Did I mention
that we'll be seeing Aerosmith?

17
00:01:42,918 --> 00:01:46,171
Until next week,
good night and party on.

18
00:01:46,254 --> 00:01:48,590
- Party on, Wayne!
- Party on, Garth.

19
00:01:57,057 --> 00:01:59,267
And we're out.

20
00:01:59,351 --> 00:02:03,021
- All right! Let's move, people!
- All right. Garth!

21
00:02:03,105 --> 00:02:06,191
- To the Mirthmobile.
- The Mirthmobile!

22
00:02:15,075 --> 00:02:16,910
All right.

23
00:02:27,713 --> 00:02:33,260
Hi. I'm Wayne Campbell. Excellent.
Welcome to Wayne's World 2.

24
00:02:33,343 --> 00:02:35,887
Let me bring you up to speed.
Come on.

25
00:02:37,723 --> 00:02:41,727
There's a lot to tell you,
so let's take the scenic route.

26
00:02:45,605 --> 00:02:50,110
A year has passed. I'm a little older
and a little wiser.

27
00:02:50,193 --> 00:02:53,488
I'm starting to get hair
in really weird places.

28
00:02:53,572 --> 00:02:56,199
I feel like
I'm turning into Sasquatch.

29
00:02:56,283 --> 00:02:59,077
I still go out
with my girlfriend Cassandra.

30
00:02:59,161 --> 00:03:01,663
She's cutting a record demo
right now.

31
00:03:01,747 --> 00:03:06,376
Her career's really taking off.
You remember Cassandra, don't you?

32
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:17,554
What a babe. She'd give a dog a bone.

33
00:03:19,056 --> 00:03:22,392
But you know,
even though I live on my own now,

34
00:03:22,476 --> 00:03:26,605
everybody's really hassling me
to do something with my life.

35
00:03:26,688 --> 00:03:28,523
To become an adult.

36
00:03:28,607 --> 00:03:33,070
I feel like I'm in a John Hughes
"rites de passage" movie.

37
00:03:33,153 --> 00:03:36,698
But what I'd really like to do
is something extraordinary.

38
00:03:36,782 --> 00:03:42,454
Something big, something mega,
copious, capacious, cajunga.

39
00:03:42,537 --> 00:03:46,666
But I'll probably
end up working at Great America,

40
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,127
mopping up hurl and lung butter.

41
00:04:00,514 --> 00:04:03,683
You remember my best friend
Garth Algar, right?

42
00:04:04,684 --> 00:04:08,605
I almost forgot.
This year, Garth finally got pubes.

43
00:04:13,985 --> 00:04:17,072
You didn't tell them
about my pubes, did you?

44
00:04:17,155 --> 00:04:19,574
No. Of course not.

45
00:04:24,538 --> 00:04:27,457
You are listening to WPIG, the Pig.

46
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:33,463
- All rock, all the time.
- WPIG Aurora.

47
00:04:33,547 --> 00:04:38,093
Handsome Dan coming at you on the
short side of nine bells at WPIG,

48
00:04:38,176 --> 00:04:42,723
America's rock authority. What do you
say we check in with Mr Scream?

49
00:04:56,945 --> 00:05:00,907
God, Handsome Dan is so cool.
He must get a million chicks.

50
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,410
I bet he's totally studly and buffed.

51
00:05:03,493 --> 00:05:06,455
With that voice,
he's gotta be a babe magnet.

52
00:05:17,758 --> 00:05:20,135
Welcome to Mikita's.
How may I serve you?

53
00:05:20,761 --> 00:05:26,975
I'd like... rullers... ugar... ucks
and a Mikita... cup.

54
00:05:30,604 --> 00:05:32,606
And then a large... with... eam.

55
00:05:33,607 --> 00:05:37,277
And could I please have... elly
doughnut and...

56
00:05:37,361 --> 00:05:41,531
...raspberry and a... nge drink?
- What?

57
00:05:41,615 --> 00:05:45,911
- I'm sorry. And... eaker... oken.
- Let me recap the order.

58
00:05:45,994 --> 00:05:50,123
A cruller, two sugar pucks,
a large coffee with cream,

59
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:54,294
a raspberry jelly doughnut,
orange drink, a box of five-holes.

60
00:05:54,378 --> 00:05:58,256
- Yeah.
- Thank you. Drive around, please.

61
00:06:04,554 --> 00:06:07,974
I'm so psyched.
Aerosmith's gonna kick ass!

62
00:06:12,062 --> 00:06:15,440
But where are we supposed
to meet Cassandra?

63
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,985
Backstage laminates.

64
00:06:32,624 --> 00:06:34,000
Encore! Encore!

65
00:07:40,442 --> 00:07:42,861
Let's go!

66
00:07:46,615 --> 00:07:49,493
Garth! Somebody just grabbed my butt!

67
00:07:49,576 --> 00:07:54,081
- All right!
- I feel weird.

68
00:07:59,169 --> 00:08:02,255
It's like a thousand fingers
urging you to let go.

69
00:08:03,256 --> 00:08:07,511
- I'm having fun.
- Excellent!

70
00:08:24,611 --> 00:08:28,657
- You guys wail! You guys rule, man!
- Lunch is here!

71
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,993
- Dude looks like a lady...
- So do you!

72
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:38,792
All right! Coming by!

73
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:42,963
Excuse me!
Where is the backstage area?

74
00:08:53,557 --> 00:08:55,600
Excuse us. Excuse me.

75
00:09:02,691 --> 00:09:04,526
They're cool.

76
00:09:10,657 --> 00:09:15,120
- There she is. Cassandra!
- Campbell!

77
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:23,003
- Campbell!
- There she is.

78
00:09:23,086 --> 00:09:27,424
- Sorry we couldn't sit together.
- No troubles. Great concert!

79
00:09:27,507 --> 00:09:32,137
I want you to meet somebody.
This is Bobby Cahn of Sharp Records.

80
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,556
- Excellent
- Good to see you.

81
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:39,478
- Bobby's my record producer.
- We must drop by the studio.

82
00:09:39,561 --> 00:09:43,565
I don't have to tell you how
extremely talented Cassandra is.

83
00:09:43,648 --> 00:09:45,650
You've heard, you've seen, you know.

84
00:09:45,734 --> 00:09:50,822
Scott. I want you to meet someone.
Cassandra, this is Scott.

85
00:09:50,906 --> 00:09:53,825
- Hi.
- And Dwayne.

86
00:09:53,909 --> 00:09:55,952
- Actually, Wayne.
- Right.

87
00:09:56,036 --> 00:10:00,332
- Bobby says you're very talented.
- I was saying the same thing.

88
00:10:00,415 --> 00:10:03,043
I want to ask you something.

89
00:10:06,671 --> 00:10:11,009
- Don't you hate schmoozing?
- Yes. I just despise it.

90
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:16,056
Stand back, please!

91
00:10:21,269 --> 00:10:24,648
We're not worthy! We're not worthy!

92
00:10:24,731 --> 00:10:29,236
- You're worthy. Get up.
- You guys were excellent tonight.

93
00:10:29,319 --> 00:10:33,782
- Thanks a lot. We'll see you inside.
- We're planning on it.

94
00:10:37,035 --> 00:10:38,870
Excellent.

95
00:10:38,954 --> 00:10:41,915
Gotcha. Great. Hold on.

96
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:44,710
Excuse me.

97
00:10:50,006 --> 00:10:54,803
- Jeez. Wayne, look.
- Garth, it's Heather Locklear.

98
00:10:56,054 --> 00:10:59,599
And she's signalling to us!
There is a God.

99
00:10:59,683 --> 00:11:02,644
Heather be thy name.

100
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:08,734
- Bobby!
- Heather!

101
00:11:08,817 --> 00:11:12,946
- Are you coming?
- Yeah, we're...

102
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:14,990
- This is Cassandra.
- Hello.

103
00:11:15,073 --> 00:11:17,242
We're supposed to be in there.

104
00:11:17,325 --> 00:11:20,495
- No, you're not.
- My girlfriend's in there.

105
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:23,790
A lot of people's girlfriends
are in there.

106
00:11:23,874 --> 00:11:26,084
Denied.

107
00:11:46,188 --> 00:11:49,191
Hi! Where are you from?
I'm from Wilmette.

108
00:11:49,274 --> 00:11:52,986
I'm from Cicero.
Isn't it cool to be downtown?

109
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:56,114
Are you those guys
with that TV show in Aurora?

110
00:11:56,198 --> 00:11:59,076
- Wayne's World?
- Wayne's World!

111
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:03,080
- No!
- You guys sure look like 'em.

112
00:12:03,163 --> 00:12:06,958
If Wayne says we're not,
we're not, OK?

113
00:12:07,042 --> 00:12:10,295
How long does it take
to get here from Aurora?

114
00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:12,547
It takes me 40 minutes door to door.

115
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:16,385
My ma gave me a dollar and
dropped me off at the park-and-ride.

116
00:12:23,433 --> 00:12:25,560
Dogs. Dogs.

117
00:12:27,521 --> 00:12:31,692
...and Marilyn. Marilyn.

118
00:12:32,442 --> 00:12:36,571
I saw the creature.
I saw the creature...

119
00:13:26,663 --> 00:13:29,958
- Who are you?
- I'm Jim Morrison.

120
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:35,839
- Cool. Who's he?
- A weird naked Indian.

121
00:13:36,381 --> 00:13:38,216
Cool.

122
00:13:39,009 --> 00:13:40,844
Why have you brought me here?

123
00:13:40,927 --> 00:13:44,431
To help you find some answers, Wayne.

124
00:13:44,514 --> 00:13:47,476
- Answers to what?
- Ask me a question.

125
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:52,356
Two trains travelling at 60mph, one
from Chicago, one from Los Angeles...

126
00:13:52,439 --> 00:13:54,858
No. Ask me a question
about your life.

127
00:13:56,026 --> 00:13:59,029
What am I supposed to do
with my life?

128
00:13:59,112 --> 00:14:02,282
You should put on a concert
in Aurora, Wayne.

129
00:14:02,366 --> 00:14:08,038
- How will I get the bands to come?
- If you book them, they will come.

130
00:14:08,663 --> 00:14:11,291
But I don't know
how to put on a concert.

131
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:14,836
You must go to England and find a man
named Del Preston,

132
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,880
the greatest roadie that ever lived.

133
00:14:16,963 --> 00:14:19,966
He was with us in the good times
and the bad.

134
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:22,719
He'll help you. Any more questions?

135
00:14:22,803 --> 00:14:26,765
Will Garth ever get his
Sports Illustrated football phone?

136
00:14:26,848 --> 00:14:28,642
It was sent to the wrong house.

137
00:14:28,725 --> 00:14:32,688
It will arrive tomorrow with
the swimsuit issue and the video,

138
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:35,065
The Stanley Cup - 100 Years of Glory.

139
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,945
How do I get back?

140
00:14:40,028 --> 00:14:44,991
- Follow the weird naked Indian.
- Cool.

141
00:14:45,075 --> 00:14:47,536
Wake up, Wayne!

142
00:14:48,662 --> 00:14:55,001
Garth! I just had the most vivid
and powerful dream of my life.

143
00:14:55,085 --> 00:14:57,963
Last night, Jim Morrison spoke to me.

144
00:14:58,046 --> 00:15:02,342
He told me that the purpose
of my life was to put on a concert.

145
00:15:04,594 --> 00:15:07,973
Guess what finally came in the mail?

146
00:15:08,056 --> 00:15:10,517
I guess they sent it
to the wrong house.

147
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,020
My Sports Illustrated
football phone...

148
00:15:13,103 --> 00:15:15,772
- Oh, my God!
- Cool.

149
00:15:15,856 --> 00:15:19,735
My Sports Illustrated
swimsuit issue...

150
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:21,778
Oh, my God.

151
00:15:21,862 --> 00:15:26,033
...and the History of the
Stanley Cup - 100 Years of Glory.

152
00:15:26,116 --> 00:15:28,618
Garth, it's a sign!

153
00:15:29,953 --> 00:15:36,126
We will put on a concert.
Oh, yes. We will put on a concert.

154
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:53,101
This must be the place.

155
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:56,855
Maybe we should've called Cassandra
before we dropped by.

156
00:15:56,938 --> 00:16:01,360
Garth, it's us. No one'll hassle us.
Cassandra needs the encouragement.

157
00:16:07,074 --> 00:16:10,827
Excuse me, what are you guys
doing here in the street?

158
00:16:10,911 --> 00:16:13,997
I'm stacking these chickens
in the crates.

159
00:16:14,081 --> 00:16:16,666
Jim makes sure we have
plenty of watermelons.

160
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,794
You're selling watermelons.

161
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:22,798
No, we just make sure there's plenty
stacked. Just like the chickens.

162
00:16:23,006 --> 00:16:25,050
What do they do?

163
00:16:25,133 --> 00:16:28,553
They walk back and forth
with this plate-glass window.

164
00:16:28,637 --> 00:16:31,556
That's weird.

165
00:16:31,807 --> 00:16:35,894
You got to wonder if this is gonna
pay off later on.

166
00:16:46,822 --> 00:16:51,785
- Cool.
- It's OK.

167
00:16:51,868 --> 00:16:55,080
Maybe we ought to overdub a track
with Bobby. He can wail.

168
00:16:55,163 --> 00:16:58,834
Give them a few minutes.
They're working on it.

169
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:02,713
The label figures
you got three singles on this one.

170
00:17:02,796 --> 00:17:05,882
- They want you to come to the coast.
- Excellent.

171
00:17:05,966 --> 00:17:09,469
Not bad for a little girl
from Hong Kong.

172
00:17:14,683 --> 00:17:19,813
- What brings you here, Wayne?
- I had to tell Cassandra something.

173
00:17:19,896 --> 00:17:22,107
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

174
00:17:23,233 --> 00:17:28,196
Last night I had a dream. We're gonna
put on a concert in Aurora.

175
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,950
- That's a great idea.
- Yeah. It's a festival.

176
00:17:32,034 --> 00:17:34,953
- A festival?
- A festival. You heard the man.

177
00:17:35,037 --> 00:17:41,209
- Charming. What's it called?
- What's it called? It's called...

178
00:17:42,878 --> 00:17:44,880
It's called...

179
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:49,509
- It's called Waynestock.
- Waynestock.

180
00:17:49,593 --> 00:17:51,428
Who's going to be there?

181
00:17:55,265 --> 00:18:00,062
- Aerosmith and Pearl Jam.
- Who else?

182
00:18:02,397 --> 00:18:06,860
Me and Wayne.

183
00:18:06,943 --> 00:18:11,031
- And...
- And...

184
00:18:12,449 --> 00:18:15,827
- Van Halen.
- Van Halen. Who else?

185
00:18:15,911 --> 00:18:17,704
Yeah. Who else?

186
00:18:17,788 --> 00:18:22,709
An old man fashioning a kayak
out of a log?

187
00:18:22,793 --> 00:18:26,463
- What?
- No! Rip Taylor!

188
00:18:26,546 --> 00:18:28,507
Rip Taylor's gonna be there.

189
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:33,053
Rip Taylor? He's a God in my country.
He gets mobbed in the street.

190
00:18:33,136 --> 00:18:38,350
Great, cos he's gonna be there.
I thought maybe you could play, too.

191
00:18:38,433 --> 00:18:41,269
- I would be honoured.
- I wouldn't commit just yet.

192
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:44,064
You got some real gigs coming up.
Real gigs!

193
00:18:44,147 --> 00:18:46,024
Real gigs?

194
00:18:46,108 --> 00:18:49,653
Lx-nay on the condescension-ay
there, Chet.

195
00:18:50,821 --> 00:18:54,533
- Bobby, can I ask you a question?
- What is it, Garth?

196
00:18:55,742 --> 00:18:58,954
A sphincter says what?

197
00:19:00,914 --> 00:19:06,336
I said, a sphincter says what?

198
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:11,967
You want me to say "what",
like I don't get it. Is that it?

199
00:19:15,262 --> 00:19:17,097
Is that it?

200
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:22,144
Oh, dear. Last guy didn't get.
You big. You big.

201
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:25,230
We small... We better go.

202
00:19:25,313 --> 00:19:27,441
- Where are you going?
- England!

203
00:19:29,317 --> 00:19:32,738
I can't believe Paramount is paying
to fly us to England.

204
00:19:32,821 --> 00:19:34,865
I thought they'd use doubles.

205
00:19:34,948 --> 00:19:40,787
- Here we are at Piccadilly Circus.
- What a shitty circus.

206
00:19:40,871 --> 00:19:43,540
Good call. There's no animals
or clowns.

207
00:19:43,623 --> 00:19:47,461
What a rip-off.
Let's go to Buckingham Palace.

208
00:19:47,544 --> 00:19:52,090
Does Princess Di still live here?
She is such a babe.

209
00:19:58,638 --> 00:20:03,101
Did Jim Morrison give you
Del Preston's exact address?

210
00:20:03,185 --> 00:20:07,314
- He said exactly London, England.
- OK.

211
00:20:12,402 --> 00:20:14,946
I don't know about this, Wayne.

212
00:20:24,581 --> 00:20:28,585
- Del?
- Hello?

213
00:20:41,932 --> 00:20:46,853
- Are you Del Preston?
- I might be. Who are you?

214
00:20:46,937 --> 00:20:49,773
- My name's Wayne Campbell.
- I'm Garth Algar.

215
00:20:49,856 --> 00:20:54,403
That's terribly fascinating, mate,
but you woke me up.

216
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:56,196
How can you sleep like that?

217
00:20:56,279 --> 00:21:01,785
Listen, Sonny Jim, sleeping like this
will add 10 years to your life.

218
00:21:05,455 --> 00:21:09,584
I learned it from Keith Richards
when I toured with the Stones.

219
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:20,721
That may be why Keith cannot be
killed by conventional weapons.

220
00:21:22,931 --> 00:21:25,267
How can I be of assistance?

221
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:29,771
You're gonna think I'm nuts,
but someone visited me in a dream

222
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:31,898
and told me that Del Preston

223
00:21:31,982 --> 00:21:35,027
would help me put on a concert
in Aurora, Illinois.

224
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:36,611
A concert?

225
00:21:39,239 --> 00:21:44,453
I'm afraid you've been misinformed.
I don't do that any more.

226
00:21:47,456 --> 00:21:51,877
I'm just an old geezer.
What do I know about music today?

227
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:55,255
When I was working,
it was all bands like Eric Clapton

228
00:21:55,338 --> 00:21:57,174
and the Rolling Stones.

229
00:21:57,257 --> 00:22:01,178
It's not like the Grateful Dead
are still touring, is it?

230
00:22:01,261 --> 00:22:03,930
- Actually...
- Garth.

231
00:22:05,682 --> 00:22:09,019
Look at this scrapbook.

232
00:22:09,102 --> 00:22:13,190
- That's you with Led Zeppelin.
- Yeah.

233
00:22:13,273 --> 00:22:15,609
My old lady put that together.

234
00:22:15,692 --> 00:22:19,613
We must've toured every concert hall
and venue in America,

235
00:22:19,696 --> 00:22:21,907
me, my old lady and the road.

236
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:24,618
- Is that you and Bob Dylan?
- Yeah.

237
00:22:24,701 --> 00:22:27,371
- Who's the old lady?
- That's my old lady.

238
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:33,460
It was fun,
but those days are gone forever.

239
00:22:33,543 --> 00:22:36,838
But we came from America
just to talk to you.

240
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:40,258
I'm sorry.
I don't do concerts any more.

241
00:22:40,342 --> 00:22:42,177
Come on. Let's go.

242
00:22:44,221 --> 00:22:50,727
Well, I still think you led
a really cool life.

243
00:22:51,645 --> 00:22:54,898
- It was nice meeting you.
- I guess Jim was wrong.

244
00:22:57,567 --> 00:22:59,403
Hang about.

245
00:23:01,863 --> 00:23:04,366
Was it Jim Morrison?

246
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:08,787
- Yes!
- Did he have a naked Indian?

247
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:12,582
- Yes!
- I have to ask you...

248
00:23:12,666 --> 00:23:15,085
Didn't you think
it was a trifle unnecessary

249
00:23:15,168 --> 00:23:17,921
to see the crack
in the Indian's bottom?

250
00:23:18,004 --> 00:23:21,800
- Yes! Absolutely!
- I had the same dream.

251
00:23:25,595 --> 00:23:30,892
- Del, you'll really love Aurora.
- Who's Aurora, anyway?

252
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:35,981
Frank, this is Bobby.
Did you get the tape?

253
00:23:36,064 --> 00:23:41,069
What'd you think?
Definitely. She sounds great.

254
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:45,407
Yeah, the band is terrible.
It's a garage band.

255
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:48,160
They can't, I'm sure.

256
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:52,748
I'm working with them.
I'm still in this studio in Aurora.

257
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:54,791
What the hell you doing there?

258
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:57,252
- She wants to stay here.
- Why?

259
00:23:57,335 --> 00:24:00,881
Same reason they all want to stay,
she's got a boyfriend.

260
00:24:00,964 --> 00:24:04,843
Don't worry. I'll get rid
of the boyfriend and the band.

261
00:24:04,926 --> 00:24:07,387
I'd like to finish the album in LA.

262
00:24:07,471 --> 00:24:10,932
All right, Bobby.
Let's just get it done, OK?

263
00:24:14,811 --> 00:24:19,232
And there I am in Sri Lanka,
formerly Ceylon, at 3am,

264
00:24:19,316 --> 00:24:23,195
looking for 1,000 brown M&Ms
to fill a brandy glass,

265
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:26,281
or Ozzy
wouldn't go on stage that night.

266
00:24:26,365 --> 00:24:29,284
Jeff Beck pops his head
round the door

267
00:24:29,368 --> 00:24:33,288
and mentions there's a little
sweet shop on the edge of town.

268
00:24:33,372 --> 00:24:36,041
We go, and it's closed.

269
00:24:36,124 --> 00:24:39,628
There's me and Keith Moon
and David Crosby

270
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:42,631
breaking into this
little sweet shop, right?

271
00:24:42,714 --> 00:24:49,596
Instead of a guard dog, they've got
this bloody great big Bengal tiger.

272
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:54,643
I managed to take out the tiger
with a can of mace,

273
00:24:54,726 --> 00:24:59,481
but the shop owner and his son,
that's a different story altogether.

274
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:03,485
I had to beat them to death
with their own shoes.

275
00:25:05,946 --> 00:25:10,867
Nasty business, really,
but sure enough, I got the M&Ms,

276
00:25:10,951 --> 00:25:15,080
and Ozzy went on stage
and did a great show.

277
00:25:15,163 --> 00:25:17,499
That was excellent.

278
00:25:19,418 --> 00:25:22,921
To put on a really great rock show,

279
00:25:23,004 --> 00:25:26,591
like Knebworth in England
or Woodstock,

280
00:25:26,675 --> 00:25:31,138
there is only one place
you can do it, and that's here,

281
00:25:31,221 --> 00:25:36,601
at Adlai Stevenson Memorial Park,
in the playing fields.

282
00:25:36,685 --> 00:25:38,687
We better go check it out.

283
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:49,823
I hear you're putting on
some kind of concert.

284
00:25:49,906 --> 00:25:54,619
That's good. People need to be
entertained, need the distraction.

285
00:25:54,703 --> 00:25:58,999
I wish somebody'd do something
to block out the voices in my head,

286
00:25:59,082 --> 00:26:01,626
the voices that scream over and over,

287
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:06,173
"Why do they come to me to die?
Why do they come to me to die?"

288
00:26:25,067 --> 00:26:28,987
- What do we do now?
- Here. Let me look at it.

289
00:26:31,907 --> 00:26:33,742
Get the flashlight.

290
00:26:36,036 --> 00:26:41,500
OK. There's the main gate,
and here we are.

291
00:26:41,583 --> 00:26:44,628
- No, we're over here.
- I don't think so.

292
00:26:44,711 --> 00:26:48,173
We turned left at the gate,
so that would put us...

293
00:26:48,256 --> 00:26:51,093
Garth! Wait a minute.

294
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:54,596
I know where we are.
I'm pretty good with maps.

295
00:26:59,309 --> 00:27:02,145
- Listen.
- What?

296
00:27:08,068 --> 00:27:11,196
- Turn it off!
- I can't turn it off!

297
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,240
I can't turn it off!

298
00:27:20,455 --> 00:27:27,337
Waynestock? You'd purposely invite
rock 'n' roll into our community?

299
00:27:27,713 --> 00:27:30,674
What's wrong
with a little entertainment?

300
00:27:30,757 --> 00:27:33,176
Entertainment is fine, but this...

301
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:37,180
We have lots of big acts
that come through here.

302
00:27:37,264 --> 00:27:42,185
- Ice Capades, Tiny Toons, Kenny G...
- Kenny G?

303
00:27:56,074 --> 00:27:59,786
We don't even get
to apply for a permit?

304
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:04,166
We would love to put on
a rock concert... not!

305
00:28:08,712 --> 00:28:13,633
Betty Jo, could we have the permits
for a festival, please?

306
00:28:13,717 --> 00:28:18,722
Thank you. You must fill out
the necessary permit applications.

307
00:28:18,805 --> 00:28:22,642
Permit applications.

308
00:28:22,726 --> 00:28:25,896
- Here you go.
- Thank you, Betty Jo.

309
00:28:28,398 --> 00:28:33,320
Hey, you're the guy
that's on that Wayne World show.

310
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,573
- Betty Jo?
- Yeah?

311
00:28:36,656 --> 00:28:38,492
Thank you.

312
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:48,293
All right. Naturally, you'll need
the application for authorisation,

313
00:28:48,377 --> 00:28:53,298
approval from the guilds and unions,
you'll need some release forms,

314
00:28:53,382 --> 00:28:59,554
the decibel level... What?
Is something wrong?

315
00:29:00,597 --> 00:29:04,685
- What do you mean?
- It's my eye, isn't it?

316
00:29:04,768 --> 00:29:07,854
Why would we want to look
at your eye?

317
00:29:07,938 --> 00:29:10,982
Is there something wrong
with that weird eye?

318
00:29:11,066 --> 00:29:15,278
There's nothing wrong with my eye.
This one just has no pigment.

319
00:29:15,362 --> 00:29:18,990
I'm what you call a partial ocular
albino, but I'm fine with it.

320
00:29:19,074 --> 00:29:22,244
I have perfect 20-20 vision
with both eyes.

321
00:29:22,327 --> 00:29:25,497
You're serious about
putting on a rock concert?

322
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:29,000
Are you kidding?
I'd give my right eye.

323
00:29:30,627 --> 00:29:35,132
You realise there are certain
jurisdictions you'll need to follow.

324
00:29:35,215 --> 00:29:38,552
I'd like to think I have
an eye for details.

325
00:29:41,722 --> 00:29:45,809
I'm assuming you have the $5,000
occupancy permit,

326
00:29:45,892 --> 00:29:48,812
or you wouldn't even be here.

327
00:29:48,895 --> 00:29:54,109
Exsqueeze me? Baking powder?
$5,000 occupancy permit?

328
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:58,030
Yes, we have that, actually.
Piece of cake.

329
00:29:58,113 --> 00:30:01,992
Fine. Then all applications
must be filled out in triplicate

330
00:30:02,075 --> 00:30:07,873
and returned at least 10 working days
before the event, with the money.

331
00:30:07,956 --> 00:30:11,668
We'll run through these
with a fine-toothed comb,

332
00:30:11,752 --> 00:30:13,587
cross the Ts and dot the...

333
00:30:16,882 --> 00:30:19,885
...lower-case Js.

334
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:31,229
I keep falling over. Oh, no.
I'm falling over a lot.

335
00:30:31,313 --> 00:30:34,358
Damn these high heels.

336
00:30:40,113 --> 00:30:44,409
- Why do you go out with me?
- I love being with you.

337
00:30:44,493 --> 00:30:47,746
Most guys are jerks.
You're a good person.

338
00:30:50,457 --> 00:30:54,002
Wait. Let me show you
what I got at a garage sale.

339
00:30:54,086 --> 00:30:57,255
- Isn't that great? Heard of it?
- Exsqueeze me?

340
00:30:57,339 --> 00:31:02,344
Have I ever seen this before?
Everybody has Frampton Comes Alive.

341
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:05,347
If you lived in the suburbs,
you were issued it.

342
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:07,683
It came in the mail
with Tide samples.

343
00:31:07,766 --> 00:31:10,268
Look at this old one.
Gerry and the Pacemakers.

344
00:31:10,352 --> 00:31:15,357
That is old. I bet those guys
actually have pacemakers by now.

345
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,361
Can you believe they don't make vinyl
any more? It's weird, isn't it?

346
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:20,862
That is weird.

347
00:31:20,946 --> 00:31:22,948
Bobby said my album won't be on
vinyl.

348
00:31:23,031 --> 00:31:26,868
Bobby says...
Are you and Bobby having an affair?

349
00:31:26,952 --> 00:31:29,579
No, of course not.
Where did you hear that?

350
00:31:29,663 --> 00:31:34,042
You know how these things start...
one guy tells another guy something,

351
00:31:34,126 --> 00:31:38,338
then he tells two friends,
and they tell two friends,

352
00:31:38,422 --> 00:31:43,385
and they tell their friends,
and so on, and so on...

353
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:48,098
- You know how it goes.
- Honestly, I'm not having an affair.

354
00:31:48,181 --> 00:31:50,809
I'm nice to him
because he's my producer.

355
00:31:50,892 --> 00:31:55,647
If this deal falls through, I lose
my visa and I go back to Hong Kong.

356
00:31:55,731 --> 00:31:58,525
You have nothing to worry about.

357
00:31:58,608 --> 00:32:01,903
My dad's coming to visit.
I'd love you to meet him.

358
00:32:01,987 --> 00:32:04,906
Treat. I'm sure he'll just love me.

359
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:08,744
Yeah. If you're anything
like my old boyfriend.

360
00:32:11,121 --> 00:32:15,625
- I'm nothing like him.
- Then we're screwed.

361
00:32:15,709 --> 00:32:18,670
I haven't seen Garth in a while.
What's he up to?

362
00:32:18,754 --> 00:32:20,547
Garth's doing his laundry.

363
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:24,468
Too bad he doesn't
have a girlfriend to do his laundry.

364
00:32:24,551 --> 00:32:27,012
Yeah. Thanks for doing my laundry.

365
00:32:27,095 --> 00:32:30,349
How do you get my clothes so white
and fresh-smelling?

366
00:32:30,432 --> 00:32:33,810
It's an old Cantonese method
few people know about.

367
00:32:35,187 --> 00:32:41,360
Wait a minute.
Calgon? Ancient Chinese secret?

368
00:33:06,301 --> 00:33:09,137
- Hello.
- Hi.

369
00:33:10,305 --> 00:33:12,724
I don't recall
ever seeing you in here.

370
00:33:12,808 --> 00:33:16,478
Maybe it's because
it's my first time in here.

371
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:20,273
That's right. My mom used
to do all my laundry, but I do now.

372
00:33:20,357 --> 00:33:23,318
I'm what you call "sans parents".

373
00:33:24,695 --> 00:33:27,781
I can go to a movie
on a school night, like that.

374
00:33:30,367 --> 00:33:33,120
Welcome to the neighbourhood.

375
00:33:39,543 --> 00:33:42,295
Would you like
some red rope liquorice?

376
00:33:42,379 --> 00:33:44,172
Sure.

377
00:33:55,350 --> 00:34:00,647
- What's your name?
- Garth Algar. What's yours?

378
00:34:02,149 --> 00:34:05,902
- I'm Honey... Horne.
- Nice to meet you, Miss Horny.

379
00:34:05,986 --> 00:34:08,196
That's Hornée. It's French.

380
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:13,452
OK, Miss Hornée.

381
00:34:13,535 --> 00:34:17,664
Garth, would you like
to have dinner some night?

382
00:34:17,748 --> 00:34:20,083
I like to have dinner every night.

383
00:34:20,167 --> 00:34:24,379
No, I mean us. You and me.
Would you like to have dinner?

384
00:34:26,173 --> 00:34:28,050
A date?

385
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:33,805
Finally. It took, like, two hours.

386
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:55,786
I like 'em teeny and toasty.
So long.

387
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,748
- Bye.
- Bye.

388
00:35:00,874 --> 00:35:04,169
- Maybe we'll see each other around.
- Yeah. See you around.

389
00:35:07,297 --> 00:35:09,800
You forgot these.

390
00:35:21,353 --> 00:35:23,605
Good night, Cassandra. Good work.

391
00:35:23,689 --> 00:35:27,025
- Thanks. See you tomorrow.
- Good night.

392
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:32,823
I have got to get you to LA.
You are buried here.

393
00:35:32,906 --> 00:35:36,034
I like it here.
All my friends are here.

394
00:35:36,118 --> 00:35:39,037
- What time is it?
- 10:35.

395
00:35:39,121 --> 00:35:42,666
Damn. I missed the start
of Wayne's show.

396
00:35:42,749 --> 00:35:46,962
OK. We're in a doll factory, right?

397
00:35:47,045 --> 00:35:49,506
It reminds me
of that movie The Leprechaun,

398
00:35:49,589 --> 00:35:52,968
with that little guy that goes,
"I'm the leprechaun."

399
00:35:53,051 --> 00:35:56,888
- Garth, I'm the leprechaun!
- Cool it, OK?

400
00:35:56,972 --> 00:35:59,975
- I'm the leprechaun!
- Stop it, all right?

401
00:36:00,058 --> 00:36:02,561
Don't try and steal me pot o' gold.

402
00:36:02,644 --> 00:36:06,148
- Why do you like these guys?
- Because they're fun.

403
00:36:06,231 --> 00:36:08,775
If I wanted a guy
that was all ambition,

404
00:36:08,859 --> 00:36:12,738
I could've stayed in Hong Kong.
Those guys are 12 for 10 cents.

405
00:36:12,821 --> 00:36:16,074
- You mean a dime a dozen.
- Maybe where you shop.

406
00:36:16,158 --> 00:36:18,952
I think you underestimate them.
They're really sharp.

407
00:36:19,036 --> 00:36:21,997
- Stop it, leprechaun man!
- Garth, chill!

408
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,166
What did those monsters do to you?

409
00:36:24,249 --> 00:36:26,251
- I'm not...
- Sweetie. Sweetie.

410
00:36:26,334 --> 00:36:32,382
Come on, sweetie.
Come on. Pixie dust. Pixie dust.

411
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:35,260
Sweetie, it's me...

412
00:36:35,344 --> 00:36:37,387
- The leprechaun!
- No!

413
00:36:37,471 --> 00:36:39,431
I'm the leprechaun.

414
00:36:39,514 --> 00:36:42,100
Yeah. These guys, really sharp.

415
00:36:42,184 --> 00:36:46,104
I'm scared! Want to leave, but can't.

416
00:36:46,188 --> 00:36:48,648
- Want to move.
- Where you gonna move?

417
00:36:48,732 --> 00:36:50,650
- You gonna move to Ireland?
- No!

418
00:36:50,734 --> 00:36:51,735
Cos I'm the leprechaun...

419
00:36:53,612 --> 00:36:55,614
Wayne, we're here!

420
00:36:58,075 --> 00:37:00,994
Here. Let me get the gate for you.

421
00:37:01,078 --> 00:37:06,541
All righty. Come on in.
Nice digs, huh?

422
00:37:09,211 --> 00:37:11,254
Cassandra, you look hot.

423
00:37:13,382 --> 00:37:15,425
Sorry.

424
00:37:15,509 --> 00:37:19,429
I'd like you to meet
my father, Mr Wong.

425
00:37:19,513 --> 00:37:22,599
Please meet you acquaintance,
Wayne Campbell.

426
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:27,854
Allow me to speak
your native tongue, Mr Wong.

427
00:37:28,313 --> 00:37:31,775
You speak Cantonese very well,
but please, call me Jeff.

428
00:37:32,109 --> 00:37:35,404
Very well... Jeff.

429
00:37:35,737 --> 00:37:38,824
Wayne, I will be blunt.

430
00:37:38,907 --> 00:37:41,785
I do not want my daughter involved

431
00:37:41,868 --> 00:37:46,373
with a man whose life has
no direction.

432
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:50,460
- Father, please.
- Quiet. Adult speaking.

433
00:37:50,711 --> 00:37:52,587
With all respect, Jeff...

434
00:37:52,671 --> 00:37:55,716
In our culture, women are
allowed to make their own decisions.

435
00:37:56,007 --> 00:38:00,721
How dare you speak to me
in such an insolent tone.

436
00:38:00,804 --> 00:38:04,599
You have left me no choice
but to fight you.

437
00:38:05,225 --> 00:38:07,728
If we are to fight,
I think it would be better...

438
00:38:07,811 --> 00:38:10,480
if we were dubbed
and not in subtitles.

439
00:38:10,564 --> 00:38:15,277
Very well, if that is your custom.
Prepare to die.

440
00:38:36,381 --> 00:38:39,092
I know all seven animal styles.

441
00:38:39,176 --> 00:38:43,722
The crane. The stag.
The horse. The tiger.

442
00:38:43,805 --> 00:38:46,308
The bat. The rat. The monkey.

443
00:38:46,391 --> 00:38:50,020
The beetle.
I will take you, old man.

444
00:39:43,824 --> 00:39:46,368
Your tongue is quick. But your sword?

445
00:39:46,451 --> 00:39:49,454
- Oh, no.
- Wayne!

446
00:40:26,616 --> 00:40:30,037
Hello? Can we talk later?
This is not a good time.

447
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,664
Just a moment.
I've got call-waiting.

448
00:40:32,748 --> 00:40:34,041
Hello. Yes?

449
00:40:34,124 --> 00:40:37,085
Can I call you back?
I am on the other line.

450
00:40:38,378 --> 00:40:42,632
Yes, he received
a Sports Illustrated football phone.

451
00:41:01,526 --> 00:41:03,362
Wayne, no!

452
00:41:05,989 --> 00:41:10,118
You've impressed me.
You're worthy of my daughter.

453
00:41:13,663 --> 00:41:14,664
Excellent!

454
00:41:16,541 --> 00:41:19,002
We got a party tomorrow at Komrades.

455
00:41:19,086 --> 00:41:21,880
It's kind of a fundraiser
for Waynestock.

456
00:41:21,963 --> 00:41:26,259
Right. There'll be a $10
cover charge. It'll be a big party.

457
00:41:26,343 --> 00:41:30,347
Because it's at Komrades,
we're calling it a Communist party.

458
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:42,359
I remember one time
I was in a place like this.

459
00:41:42,442 --> 00:41:47,781
Sri Lanka. Formerly Ceylon.
It was about three in the morning.

460
00:41:47,864 --> 00:41:52,285
I was looking for 1,000 brown M&Ms
to fill a brandy glass,

461
00:41:52,369 --> 00:41:55,247
or Ozzy wouldn't go on stage
that night.

462
00:41:55,330 --> 00:41:58,834
Jeff Beck pops his head
round the door

463
00:41:58,917 --> 00:42:02,713
and mentions there's a little
sweet shop on the edge of town.

464
00:42:02,796 --> 00:42:06,216
- Wayne! Garth!
- Milton! How's it going?

465
00:42:06,299 --> 00:42:11,179
Awesome party!
Good tunes, good brew, good buddies.

466
00:42:11,263 --> 00:42:14,558
I feel great, man. I feel great!

467
00:42:14,641 --> 00:42:18,645
I don't know, man.
I hate my father. I hate my life.

468
00:42:18,729 --> 00:42:21,606
But I feel great. You guys are great.

469
00:42:23,483 --> 00:42:25,318
I'm gonna go pick a fight.

470
00:42:27,279 --> 00:42:29,990
He's gotten a lot better,
don't you think?

471
00:42:30,073 --> 00:42:32,826
- Way better.
- Yeah.

472
00:42:32,909 --> 00:42:37,205
- Thank you.
- We'll be back in a bit.

473
00:42:42,502 --> 00:42:46,256
- How's it going?
- Hi.

474
00:42:46,339 --> 00:42:48,508
It's looking good, Campbell.

475
00:42:48,592 --> 00:42:51,053
- I'll be at the bar.
- Good.

476
00:42:51,136 --> 00:42:53,638
I'm so glad you made it.
You look amazing!

477
00:42:54,097 --> 00:42:57,726
I see. Wait. I have great news.

478
00:42:57,809 --> 00:43:00,937
Bobby's taking me to LA
to do the final mix on my album.

479
00:43:01,021 --> 00:43:06,693
- Isn't that terrific?
- That's great. I'm ecstatic.

480
00:43:06,902 --> 00:43:10,989
I'm beside myself with joy.
Hooray for Hollywood.

481
00:43:11,073 --> 00:43:13,617
Living on your own has its perks.

482
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:16,912
Your mom doesn't tell you
to turn down the stereo.

483
00:43:16,995 --> 00:43:19,206
That's a real drag.

484
00:43:19,289 --> 00:43:23,668
Because moms genetically hate music
played at the appropriate level.

485
00:43:23,752 --> 00:43:26,421
And my dad, forget it.

486
00:43:26,505 --> 00:43:30,300
He'd ruin a Led Zeppelin
reunion concert.

487
00:43:30,384 --> 00:43:33,637
He hates music at the correct level.

488
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:38,600
But the shopkeeper and his son
was a different story altogether.

489
00:43:39,768 --> 00:43:44,022
I had to beat them to death
with their own shoes.

490
00:43:46,358 --> 00:43:49,403
- What's the deal with Bobby?
- Wayne?

491
00:43:49,486 --> 00:43:54,032
It's getting a little out of hand.
I think you better say something.

492
00:43:54,116 --> 00:43:57,869
Good call.
Everybody, I'd like to say something!

493
00:43:57,953 --> 00:44:01,415
Excuse me. Everybody,
can I get your attention?

494
00:44:01,498 --> 00:44:04,126
I'd like to say something.
Keep it down.

495
00:44:04,209 --> 00:44:07,754
We're really glad
you could all make it.

496
00:44:07,838 --> 00:44:13,427
We never knew we had so many friends
who believed in this concert idea.

497
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:17,222
When we first had this idea
of putting on this shindig,

498
00:44:17,305 --> 00:44:19,766
we didn't know if anyone would come.

499
00:44:19,850 --> 00:44:24,604
But look...
You're all here, pitching in.

500
00:44:24,688 --> 00:44:27,357
I promised myself I wouldn't cry.

501
00:44:32,404 --> 00:44:34,239
Party on!

502
00:45:22,579 --> 00:45:26,917
Garth, I'm starting to get
a bad feeling, man.

503
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,835
I think something's going on.

504
00:45:41,431 --> 00:45:46,186
Hello. Yes?
Is this Aerosmith's tour manager?

505
00:45:46,269 --> 00:45:49,981
It is? Hello.
My name is Wayne Campbell.

506
00:45:50,065 --> 00:45:52,984
You don't know me.
I'm not mental or anything,

507
00:45:53,068 --> 00:45:57,781
I'm putting on a concert in Aurora,
Illinois. Yes, I can hold.

508
00:45:57,864 --> 00:46:02,285
Del, look. For years I thought
this was a Mercedes emblem.

509
00:46:02,369 --> 00:46:05,455
Woodstock?
That was quite a show, man.

510
00:46:05,539 --> 00:46:09,292
- You were at Woodstock?
- Excellent. What was it like?

511
00:46:09,376 --> 00:46:15,632
It rained all morning and then it
cleared up in the afternoon.

512
00:46:15,716 --> 00:46:19,845
That's it. I almost remembered
something else, but it's gone.

513
00:46:19,928 --> 00:46:23,056
You can't remember what it was?
Still holding. I want...

514
00:46:24,683 --> 00:46:29,187
- Wayne, look what I made.
- Good work, my friend.

515
00:46:32,399 --> 00:46:34,693
You guys got the permit applications?

516
00:46:36,737 --> 00:46:38,572
Got the money?

517
00:46:39,781 --> 00:46:44,828
Good for you. Most people
just take them and never come back.

518
00:47:06,516 --> 00:47:09,227
Position 1 to Position 2.
Do you copy?

519
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:13,732
This is Position 2 in position.
Position 3, what's your position?

520
00:47:13,815 --> 00:47:16,360
Position 3. I read you.

521
00:47:16,443 --> 00:47:21,365
- Position 4, do you copy? Over.
- 4 copies. Back to Position 1. Over.

522
00:47:21,448 --> 00:47:24,868
I've to go to LA
for a couple of days.

523
00:47:24,951 --> 00:47:29,915
If you need anything...
I'm at this number.

524
00:47:37,547 --> 00:47:41,551
Position 1 to Position 2.
Did you see that?

525
00:47:41,635 --> 00:47:46,682
This is Position 2 in position!
Sorry, man. I didn't see anything.

526
00:47:49,184 --> 00:47:51,019
What is it?

527
00:47:54,690 --> 00:47:57,776
Abort! We have been identified!

528
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:04,658
Abandon positions!

529
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:11,373
Wayne, let's run away!

530
00:48:34,771 --> 00:48:38,859
Garth, it's locked! In here!

531
00:49:20,734 --> 00:49:22,235
Come on! Let's go!

532
00:49:46,009 --> 00:49:48,679
Do it, Miss Thing! Do it! Do it!

533
00:50:18,583 --> 00:50:20,627
Get it, girl! Get it, girl!

534
00:51:21,938 --> 00:51:26,068
What's the matter? You look like you
want to say something to me.

535
00:51:26,777 --> 00:51:30,530
- I think we should break up.
- What? Why?

536
00:51:30,614 --> 00:51:36,411
Because there comes a time when
people should go their separate ways.

537
00:51:36,495 --> 00:51:43,126
I mean, I've got Waynestock, you've
got your career and your producer,

538
00:51:43,210 --> 00:51:47,881
and I just think it's time
that we should see other people.

539
00:51:50,217 --> 00:51:52,219
I don't want to see other people.

540
00:51:52,302 --> 00:51:55,222
- What about Bobby?
- What about him?

541
00:51:55,305 --> 00:52:00,268
Come on! Do you think
I'm a gullibull or even a gullicalf?

542
00:52:00,352 --> 00:52:02,688
I've no idea
what you're talking about.

543
00:52:02,771 --> 00:52:06,650
Right! Come on, now!
What about these?

544
00:52:12,823 --> 00:52:16,451
- Where did these come from?
- I did a little detective work.

545
00:52:16,535 --> 00:52:20,455
- You did spy on me.
- Yes, I did.

546
00:52:24,042 --> 00:52:25,502
Easy.

547
00:52:26,837 --> 00:52:29,715
I think she took that well.

548
00:52:31,341 --> 00:52:33,218
Let's go.

549
00:52:36,304 --> 00:52:39,099
Ladies and gentlemen!

550
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:46,857
Your roadie training begins today.
It will not be easy.

551
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:51,236
You will get tired.
You will get blisters.

552
00:52:51,319 --> 00:52:56,992
You will get aches and pains.
But you will also get good.

553
00:52:59,494 --> 00:53:02,247
- Are you ready?
- Yes, sir!

554
00:53:02,330 --> 00:53:05,834
Roadies present
and accounted for, sir!

555
00:53:05,917 --> 00:53:07,753
Let's begin.

556
00:53:15,093 --> 00:53:17,679
Eye on the task! Come on. Let's go!

557
00:53:22,684 --> 00:53:25,062
Jesus! He's crazy!

558
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:30,025
They're getting better, Del. Look.

559
00:53:38,241 --> 00:53:40,744
Get that microphone!

560
00:53:46,875 --> 00:53:50,796
You're worthless!
You're less than nothing!

561
00:53:50,879 --> 00:53:54,132
What's keeping you here?
You don't belong here!

562
00:53:54,216 --> 00:54:00,097
- Why don't you just quit?
- Cos I got no place else to go!

563
00:54:19,199 --> 00:54:23,870
Thanks for coming in with me. I'm
always afraid to come in by myself.

564
00:54:31,044 --> 00:54:34,756
Come. Come on.

565
00:54:41,346 --> 00:54:43,682
Come on. Sit down.

566
00:54:46,685 --> 00:54:49,104
And I'll fix us a little drink, OK?

567
00:55:17,632 --> 00:55:20,927
There you are. An old-fashioned.

568
00:55:25,390 --> 00:55:28,185
This Coke's gone bad.

569
00:55:28,268 --> 00:55:33,065
I just love a man
with a sense of humour.

570
00:55:33,148 --> 00:55:35,192
- You know what I wish?
- What?

571
00:55:35,275 --> 00:55:39,863
I wish I could climb inside that big
brain of yours and just walk around.

572
00:55:39,946 --> 00:55:42,366
Really?

573
00:55:42,449 --> 00:55:44,409
- You know what I love?
- What?

574
00:55:44,493 --> 00:55:48,497
I love the way those big,
thick glasses magnify your pupils.

575
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:50,791
Look at me.

576
00:55:52,334 --> 00:55:56,046
I'll bet you like to be
in control. Tell me.

577
00:55:56,129 --> 00:56:01,802
When I was 17, my little sister tried
to borrow my Def Leppard record.

578
00:56:01,885 --> 00:56:06,598
- I said, "No way."
- That's just what I'm talking about.

579
00:56:08,684 --> 00:56:13,689
- Oh, my God. You're so limber.
- Don't you just love music?

580
00:56:20,362 --> 00:56:22,406
Do you have any Megadeth?

581
00:56:34,918 --> 00:56:40,257
- Come with me.
- I'm blind.

582
00:56:52,310 --> 00:56:54,479
I'm dancing.

583
00:56:57,691 --> 00:57:00,068
You're real squiggly.

584
00:57:05,323 --> 00:57:08,118
- Did you hurt yourself?
- Yeah.

585
00:57:08,201 --> 00:57:11,788
- Let me see. Oh. There.
- That's it. Yeah.

586
00:57:13,206 --> 00:57:17,461
Feel naughty. Feel naughty.
I thought I saw a puddy cat.

587
00:57:18,211 --> 00:57:20,714
Boldly go where no man
has gone before.

588
00:57:20,797 --> 00:57:24,676
- There's got to be a way to find...
- Take me, Garth.

589
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:27,721
Where?
I'm low on gas and you need a jacket.

590
00:57:27,804 --> 00:57:31,933
- I'm gonna be frank.
- OK. Can I still be Garth?

591
00:57:32,017 --> 00:57:34,269
Shut up and kiss me.

592
00:58:05,258 --> 00:58:08,512
Can I have some cocoa later?

593
00:58:16,561 --> 00:58:21,316
Good morning, darling.
I trust you slept well.

594
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:23,819
I hope I wasn't
too much of an animal.

595
00:58:25,987 --> 00:58:30,659
- Come. Hold me.
- You know I will.

596
00:58:34,496 --> 00:58:35,580
Party on.

597
00:58:37,457 --> 00:58:40,836
He's bobbing.
He's weaving. He winds up!

598
00:58:40,919 --> 00:58:43,630
Outside!

599
00:58:48,468 --> 00:58:51,722
- Are you all right?
- Women.

600
00:58:51,805 --> 00:58:55,934
I feel like I'm in the delete bin
of life, next to Mahogany Rush.

601
00:58:57,227 --> 00:59:02,315
I'm sorry.
Relationships aren't for the timid.

602
00:59:03,984 --> 00:59:06,278
And I should know.

603
00:59:07,738 --> 00:59:11,825
For I'm no longer a stranger
in the ways of the woman.

604
00:59:11,908 --> 00:59:15,871
All right, man, all right.
Good work, my friend.

605
00:59:15,954 --> 00:59:20,167
- On that note, game on.
- Game on!

606
00:59:21,668 --> 00:59:23,128
All right!

607
00:59:23,211 --> 00:59:28,925
He's wheeling. He's dealing.
He shoots! He scores!

608
00:59:29,009 --> 00:59:34,556
OK. Ladies and gentlemen, it takes
two people to run a concert.

609
00:59:35,307 --> 00:59:40,937
One backstage and one out front. Two.

610
00:59:41,813 --> 00:59:45,317
One man alone cannot do this.

611
00:59:46,401 --> 00:59:49,654
Wayne, you will run
the backstage team.

612
00:59:49,738 --> 00:59:55,285
Milton, you are the liaison
between Wayne's backstage team

613
00:59:55,369 --> 01:00:00,665
and Garth's frontstage team,
which includes myself in the booth.

614
01:00:00,749 --> 01:00:05,379
To the left and the right of
the stage are the machine gun nests,

615
01:00:05,462 --> 01:00:07,297
belt-fed M-60 Brownings.

616
01:00:07,381 --> 01:00:11,593
These babies tend to heat up,
so shoot in three-second bursts.

617
01:00:11,677 --> 01:00:14,304
In the event of capture,

618
01:00:14,388 --> 01:00:17,432
I will personally
distribute cyanide capsules,

619
01:00:17,516 --> 01:00:22,479
to be placed under the tongue
like so. Any questions?

620
01:00:22,688 --> 01:00:26,858
Yeah. I have a question.
When did you turn into a nut bar?

621
01:00:32,364 --> 01:00:34,741
Thank you, Mr Scream.

622
01:00:34,825 --> 01:00:37,953
In a minute I'll be joined
by Wayne and Garth,

623
01:00:38,036 --> 01:00:41,540
giving us the low-down
on the Waynestock concert.

624
01:00:41,623 --> 01:00:45,585
Hi. We're here to see Handsome Dan.
I'm Wayne Campbell.

625
01:00:45,669 --> 01:00:50,590
Ja. I know. We've been expecting you,
Wayne Campbell. I am Bjergen Kjergen.

626
01:00:50,674 --> 01:00:52,968
I love your accent.
Where are you from?

627
01:00:53,051 --> 01:00:56,805
- I am from Sweden.
- Really? Whereabouts in Sweden?

628
01:00:56,888 --> 01:00:59,057
Knuergen, near the Bjoergen Fjords.

629
01:00:59,141 --> 01:01:01,560
Nice to meet you, Bjergen Kjergen

630
01:01:01,643 --> 01:01:04,062
from Knuergen
near the Bjoergen Fjords.

631
01:01:04,146 --> 01:01:05,313
Knuergen.

632
01:01:05,397 --> 01:01:08,442
That's the Kluergen province,
near the Bibeurgen River.

633
01:01:08,525 --> 01:01:11,153
- Ja.
- Now correct me if I'm wrong.

634
01:01:11,236 --> 01:01:16,908
Your rainfall varies from 40 inches
in the winter to 200 in summer.

635
01:01:16,992 --> 01:01:19,786
And your chief export
is modular furniture.

636
01:01:19,870 --> 01:01:22,706
I did a project on Sweden
in the eighth grade.

637
01:01:22,789 --> 01:01:26,084
I am impressed with your quest
for knowledge.

638
01:01:26,168 --> 01:01:30,797
- Educated men are rare.
- I was up all night working on it.

639
01:01:30,881 --> 01:01:33,175
Then the next day in gym class,

640
01:01:33,258 --> 01:01:36,094
I was on the minitramp,
and I got diarrhoea.

641
01:01:38,347 --> 01:01:40,515
I really wish I hadn't told you that.

642
01:01:40,599 --> 01:01:45,062
I am sorry to hear of your illness,
but since you've sacrificed

643
01:01:45,145 --> 01:01:49,941
your health for knowledge of my
country, I find you very attractive.

644
01:01:50,025 --> 01:01:53,487
I hope to make love to you
in the near future.

645
01:01:55,989 --> 01:02:00,452
OK. All right. OK. All right.

646
01:02:00,535 --> 01:02:03,205
Dick Van Dyke Show.

647
01:02:06,375 --> 01:02:09,002
- Good work, my friend.
- Yeah.

648
01:02:12,047 --> 01:02:16,677
- Are you wearing Brut?
- Yes.

649
01:02:17,052 --> 01:02:20,222
My woman likes me in cologne.

650
01:02:20,347 --> 01:02:24,226
Wayne, Garth, let me get
my headset off. I'll be right out.

651
01:02:30,899 --> 01:02:33,527
Hi, Handsome Dan.
It's great to meet you.

652
01:02:34,444 --> 01:02:36,488
I'm not Handsome Dan.

653
01:02:42,494 --> 01:02:46,123
- Hi...
- Handsome Dan.

654
01:02:51,086 --> 01:02:54,631
Back with you on WPIG, maximum grunt.

655
01:02:56,383 --> 01:02:59,511
Our special guests,
Wayne Campbell, Garth Algar.

656
01:02:59,594 --> 01:03:01,263
Wayne's World, all right.

657
01:03:01,346 --> 01:03:04,975
Waynestock. Big event.
Everybody's excited.

658
01:03:05,058 --> 01:03:08,437
It's gonna be a big concert
at Adlai Stevenson Park.

659
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:11,189
It's gonna be a big party.

660
01:03:11,273 --> 01:03:14,109
- We got some great bands coming.
- Like Aerosmith.

661
01:03:16,153 --> 01:03:21,366
- There's still tickets left.
- Don't wait till the last minute.

662
01:03:21,450 --> 01:03:24,202
Cos it's a chance
for the city of Aurora...

663
01:03:25,495 --> 01:03:28,582
To do something...

664
01:03:28,665 --> 01:03:30,667
Fun.

665
01:03:30,751 --> 01:03:35,630
- And to put the city on the map.
- It's a lot of work.

666
01:03:35,714 --> 01:03:41,219
- Work is hard.
- You're not listening, are you?

667
01:03:41,303 --> 01:03:44,181
I could say anything,
like "you're a complete tool".

668
01:03:45,349 --> 01:03:50,479
You wouldn't hear,
cos you're a freak with a microphone.

669
01:03:50,562 --> 01:03:55,192
It's not challenging any more.
It's like shooting fish in a barrel.

670
01:03:55,275 --> 01:03:57,652
- True, sphincter boy?
- What? Oh.

671
01:03:57,736 --> 01:04:00,280
They're getting closer.

672
01:04:00,364 --> 01:04:04,368
Good information about Waynestock.
We'll be back after PIG sports.

673
01:04:04,451 --> 01:04:07,871
It's 16 minutes past the big hour.
Right, Mr Scream?

674
01:04:13,460 --> 01:04:16,880
Great. Good stuff.
I think people are getting cranked.

675
01:04:24,721 --> 01:04:30,435
- Hi. Bobby, it's Wayne Campbell.
- Wayne. How'd you get this number?

676
01:04:30,519 --> 01:04:33,939
It was written on the
back of a business card.

677
01:04:34,022 --> 01:04:39,027
I'm looking for Cassandra. I have to
talk to her. It's really important.

678
01:04:39,111 --> 01:04:40,696
No, I haven't seen her.

679
01:04:40,779 --> 01:04:44,282
She said she might come to LA.
She wasn't definite.

680
01:04:45,951 --> 01:04:48,245
If I hear anything,
I'll let you know.

681
01:04:48,328 --> 01:04:52,290
I have to go. I'm with someone.
I'm sorry I couldn't help.

682
01:04:52,374 --> 01:04:55,460
OK. Thanks. Bye.

683
01:04:58,588 --> 01:05:02,634
- Important call?
- Some small-time promoter.

684
01:05:10,392 --> 01:05:12,602
Let's get some lunch.

685
01:05:45,052 --> 01:05:48,513
What you're saying is that
Peter Lawford warned Kennedy

686
01:05:48,597 --> 01:05:51,600
not to mess with
the military-industrial complex.

687
01:05:51,683 --> 01:05:57,022
Yeah. Dig this, man...
J Edgar Hoover was one bad cat.

688
01:05:57,105 --> 01:06:00,609
I mean, he had a completely
different bag from Jack.

689
01:06:00,692 --> 01:06:05,364
He just couldn't groove. When two
cats can't groove to the same tune,

690
01:06:05,447 --> 01:06:08,700
one of them has to visit
the man upstairs.

691
01:06:08,784 --> 01:06:11,661
That's amazing, man. Excuse me.

692
01:06:11,745 --> 01:06:16,083
Wayne, I want you to meet a friend
of mine, Sammy Davis Jr.

693
01:06:16,166 --> 01:06:20,420
- Nice to meet you, Mr Jr.
- Nice to meet you, too, man.

694
01:06:20,504 --> 01:06:23,423
I gotta split.
I got some cats I gotta hang with.

695
01:06:23,507 --> 01:06:27,010
Bye, Sammy. He's a good man.

696
01:06:27,094 --> 01:06:30,222
And now, Wayne,
what can I do you for?

697
01:06:30,305 --> 01:06:32,766
Listen, Jim,
I'm really confused, OK?

698
01:06:32,849 --> 01:06:35,811
We haven't sold any tickets,
we have no bands,

699
01:06:35,894 --> 01:06:39,731
Garth is distracted by chicks,
I broke up with my girlfriend,

700
01:06:39,815 --> 01:06:43,151
and on top of all that,
Del's gone completely mental.

701
01:06:43,235 --> 01:06:47,322
To complete your journey, you have
to help some people along the way.

702
01:06:47,406 --> 01:06:50,784
This next little bit,
you'll have to go it alone.

703
01:06:50,867 --> 01:06:52,619
Keep the faith, my friend.

704
01:06:52,703 --> 01:06:58,041
If you book them, they will come.
Hey, Sammy, wait up.

705
01:06:59,793 --> 01:07:02,921
Jim, what if nobody shows up?

706
01:07:17,060 --> 01:07:20,814
Sand. Cool.

707
01:07:23,817 --> 01:07:28,071
Right. Right, Moe. I understand.

708
01:07:28,155 --> 01:07:31,450
- Nervous?
- A little.

709
01:07:31,533 --> 01:07:34,161
I've never been
on The Tonight Show before.

710
01:07:34,244 --> 01:07:36,705
Nothing to worry about.
After the show, I...

711
01:07:36,788 --> 01:07:39,666
I have to fly to Aurora.
I'm doing Waynestock.

712
01:07:39,750 --> 01:07:42,919
Waynestock?
What's this Waynestock thing?

713
01:07:43,003 --> 01:07:46,757
- Nothing. Something she has to do.
- Hold on a second, Moe.

714
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:50,969
Listen, Bobby's put together
some great musicians.

715
01:07:51,053 --> 01:07:55,557
You're making a great album.
Together, it can't miss.

716
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:58,018
You're in good hands. He's the best.

717
01:07:58,101 --> 01:08:01,605
You listen to Bobby
and you'll be a big star.

718
01:08:01,688 --> 01:08:05,359
A big star. Moe? Yeah.

719
01:08:07,444 --> 01:08:11,698
We're almost out of time,
but I'd just like to point out

720
01:08:11,782 --> 01:08:16,620
there are still plenty of excellent
Waynestock tickets still available.

721
01:08:16,703 --> 01:08:19,081
Actually, there are about 10,000

722
01:08:19,164 --> 01:08:22,292
excellent Waynestock
tickets still available.

723
01:08:22,376 --> 01:08:24,670
And I'd also
like to address a rumour.

724
01:08:24,753 --> 01:08:28,298
There's this rumour
that none of the bands have signed

725
01:08:28,382 --> 01:08:30,550
and probably no one's gonna show up.

726
01:08:30,634 --> 01:08:34,304
It's true that none of the bands
have signed.

727
01:08:34,388 --> 01:08:37,265
Jim Morrison
and his weird naked Indian friend

728
01:08:37,349 --> 01:08:41,687
visited me in the night and assured
me that all the bands will come.

729
01:08:41,770 --> 01:08:44,898
That's all the time
we have this week, so until then...

730
01:08:44,981 --> 01:08:47,859
- Party on, Garth.
- Party on, Wayne.

731
01:08:55,951 --> 01:08:58,745
- And we're clear.
- All right!

732
01:09:02,374 --> 01:09:06,920
I don't know if you should mention
that Jim Morrison thing any more.

733
01:09:07,004 --> 01:09:10,757
Yeah. It's just that people
have started to talk.

734
01:09:10,841 --> 01:09:12,384
They're saying things like,

735
01:09:12,467 --> 01:09:15,554
"Hey, there goes Garth
and his friend Wayne...

736
01:09:15,637 --> 01:09:18,265
"...the psychopath."

737
01:09:18,348 --> 01:09:21,560
It's embarrassing.
No offence or nothing.

738
01:09:21,643 --> 01:09:23,478
No. None taken.

739
01:09:26,064 --> 01:09:28,025
I believe this knife is yours.

740
01:09:30,944 --> 01:09:34,865
It's just that things
have started to look a little bleak.

741
01:09:34,948 --> 01:09:37,743
Bleak? What? Hey, no guff, Chet.

742
01:09:37,826 --> 01:09:41,580
Until you pointed that out,
it hadn't occurred to me.

743
01:09:41,663 --> 01:09:43,582
- Where you going?
- Mikita's.

744
01:09:43,665 --> 01:09:48,295
- The usual. Are you coming?
- No. You guys go and have fun.

745
01:09:48,378 --> 01:09:51,340
I'd probably end up
embarrassing you anyways.

746
01:09:51,423 --> 01:09:55,802
No, no. I'm just gonna to stay here
and lick the cat's butt.

747
01:09:59,222 --> 01:10:04,519
Just 15-20 minutes three times a week
can really make a difference...

748
01:10:04,603 --> 01:10:09,524
- And all the other products?
- Joe, you know the price. 29.95.

749
01:10:11,902 --> 01:10:15,113
And that song is from your album.

750
01:10:15,197 --> 01:10:18,408
Oh, man. She looks great.

751
01:10:18,492 --> 01:10:22,913
It should be out next month,
or we hope it will be.

752
01:10:22,996 --> 01:10:26,249
Who's we? Who are you looking at?
Let's see the guy.

753
01:10:26,333 --> 01:10:30,879
- That's Bobby Cahn, my producer.
- That fine-looking man?

754
01:10:30,962 --> 01:10:34,716
I'm in the wrong business.
I should be a record producer.

755
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:37,886
Then I'd have attractive
women smiling at me.

756
01:10:39,763 --> 01:10:45,143
She will be mine again. Oh, yes.
She will be mine again.

757
01:10:47,521 --> 01:10:50,565
- You were terrific. They loved you.
- You think so?

758
01:10:50,649 --> 01:10:53,068
Listen to them.
They loved you. Me, too.

759
01:10:53,151 --> 01:10:56,071
I didn't think I could
do it without my band.

760
01:10:56,154 --> 01:10:58,865
Your guys were so hot.
Damn, I had fun.

761
01:10:58,949 --> 01:11:01,451
- Good. Let's celebrate.
- OK.

762
01:11:01,535 --> 01:11:07,374
- Did you think about what I said?
- Yeah. I'm still thinking about it.

763
01:11:07,624 --> 01:11:11,753
- Give me a week?
- OK.

764
01:11:14,172 --> 01:11:16,675
W-what's the matter?
Is anything wrong?

765
01:11:20,887 --> 01:11:22,848
Garth, I'm so scared.

766
01:11:22,931 --> 01:11:25,976
What? Has someone hurt you?
I'll take care of it.

767
01:11:26,059 --> 01:11:28,061
I'm a grown-up now, you know.

768
01:11:28,145 --> 01:11:33,942
- It's... it's my husband.
- Your what?

769
01:11:34,026 --> 01:11:38,196
Darling. I meant to tell you,
but my divorce isn't final,

770
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:42,576
and he came over here yesterday,
and he was crazy, like an animal.

771
01:11:42,659 --> 01:11:47,831
- I wish someone would kill him.
- You mean, kill your husband?

772
01:11:47,914 --> 01:11:51,793
No! Don't say it.
You mustn't even think it.

773
01:11:51,877 --> 01:11:55,881
I mean, I know you love me,
but I won't let you kill my husband.

774
01:11:55,964 --> 01:11:59,593
Although I know you want to.
We both know you want to.

775
01:11:59,676 --> 01:12:04,806
Then you could have me any time
you want. And I do mean any time.

776
01:12:04,890 --> 01:12:09,436
Get me my cigarettes, would you,
lover? They're in my purse.

777
01:12:12,439 --> 01:12:14,274
I'm just so...

778
01:12:19,905 --> 01:12:22,157
That's a pretty big gun.

779
01:12:23,575 --> 01:12:27,621
Darling,
all this talk about killing

780
01:12:27,704 --> 01:12:31,708
and.45 magnums with the
clip filed down and the safety off.

781
01:12:31,792 --> 01:12:34,378
It's just all so confusing...

782
01:12:34,670 --> 01:12:38,173
I won't. I won't. I won't...

783
01:12:40,634 --> 01:12:43,887
- I won't let you.
- He is a dead man.

784
01:12:52,771 --> 01:12:54,815
No way.

785
01:12:57,734 --> 01:13:01,446
You know what? I got myself into
this, I'll get myself out of it.

786
01:13:01,530 --> 01:13:05,951
I'll take it on the chin
and be a man.

787
01:13:06,034 --> 01:13:10,414
Keep the faith.
If you book them, they will come.

788
01:13:11,873 --> 01:13:17,421
OK. All right, man. You got to stop
doing that, all right? Oh, man.

789
01:13:17,504 --> 01:13:23,093
- Hello, is anybody here? Hello.
- Oh, my God! Rip Taylor!

790
01:13:24,177 --> 01:13:27,431
You must be Wayne Campbell.
How are you?

791
01:13:27,514 --> 01:13:30,517
- Very good.
- This must be Waynestock.

792
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:32,144
Yes, it is.

793
01:13:32,227 --> 01:13:36,148
- It's rustic and bucolic, but cute.
- Thanks.

794
01:13:36,231 --> 01:13:39,901
How are you, pal? Better get ready
for the show. Get dressed.

795
01:13:39,985 --> 01:13:43,196
- You can see him?
- Of course I can.

796
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:46,491
How are you gonna miss
a half-naked Indian?

797
01:13:46,575 --> 01:13:51,038
- Rip Taylor, Garth Algar.
- Rip, you showed up. Cool.

798
01:13:51,121 --> 01:13:54,333
My people
got a call from you. Thank you.

799
01:13:54,416 --> 01:13:57,586
Before I could say no,
this guy came to me in a dream.

800
01:13:57,669 --> 01:14:02,591
I said, "Who are you?" He said,
"Jim Morrison. I'm a dead rock star."

801
01:14:02,674 --> 01:14:06,595
I said, "I'm not familiar with
your work." So he played The Doors.

802
01:14:06,678 --> 01:14:11,016
I said, "You're like a crooner
in the rock milieu, which I like."

803
01:14:11,099 --> 01:14:16,021
- Why is our order taking so long?
- He said, "You gotta do Waynestock."

804
01:14:16,104 --> 01:14:18,398
I figured, what the hey?

805
01:14:19,524 --> 01:14:22,110
- Hey, what's going on?
- Don't you know?

806
01:14:22,194 --> 01:14:24,196
- No.
- We're here for Waynestock.

807
01:14:24,279 --> 01:14:26,865
Same here, dude.
Really looking forward to it, too.

808
01:14:28,909 --> 01:14:30,535
Where did these people come from?

809
01:14:30,619 --> 01:14:33,413
We got to get back
to the playing fields.

810
01:14:44,299 --> 01:14:48,178
Have you seen Cassandra?
I know. It's weird.

811
01:14:48,261 --> 01:14:50,806
I don't know where she is, either.

812
01:14:50,889 --> 01:14:55,185
I know. I mean, she said she'd play,
and she never misses a gig.

813
01:14:55,268 --> 01:14:58,188
If you see her,
send her over to Waynestock.

814
01:14:58,271 --> 01:15:00,691
Thanks a lot, Chief.
All right, bye-bye.

815
01:15:00,774 --> 01:15:06,613
Wayne! Wayne!
Here's what's happening so far.

816
01:15:06,697 --> 01:15:10,283
People have started to show up,
but none of the bands are here.

817
01:15:10,367 --> 01:15:15,080
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to hurl.

818
01:15:15,163 --> 01:15:20,210
Garth, ix-nay on the url-hay.
Think! Where could Cassandra be?

819
01:15:24,506 --> 01:15:26,675
I think I had too much Jolt cola.

820
01:15:32,514 --> 01:15:33,515
Jeff, Wayne.

821
01:15:33,598 --> 01:15:36,018
I cannot find your daughter
and I'm troubled.

822
01:15:36,101 --> 01:15:39,813
My friend. I've chosen another
for my daughter.

823
01:15:39,896 --> 01:15:43,817
You are an excellent warrior,
but I require more in a son-in-law.

824
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:45,610
He has money.

825
01:15:45,694 --> 01:15:48,530
Name the one you have chosen!
He will die by my hand.

826
01:15:48,613 --> 01:15:50,574
He goes by the name of Bobby.

827
01:15:50,657 --> 01:15:53,785
He has offered security,
a career and a green card.

828
01:15:53,869 --> 01:15:55,829
I arranged the match myself.

829
01:15:55,912 --> 01:15:59,624
Though I am sure this will be
useless to you so late in the film,

830
01:15:59,708 --> 01:16:03,378
they'll be married at the
First Presbyterian Church.

831
01:16:03,462 --> 01:16:06,214
Sorry I could not invite you
to the wedding.

832
01:16:08,425 --> 01:16:11,094
It's OK. She's marrying Bobby.

833
01:16:14,765 --> 01:16:16,183
What are you doing?

834
01:16:16,266 --> 01:16:20,437
I'm out! I have to go find Cassandra
and tell her how I feel.

835
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:23,857
But I can't do the concert alone.
It takes two.

836
01:16:23,940 --> 01:16:28,195
You're right. I'm in.
But I love her! I'm freaking out!

837
01:16:28,278 --> 01:16:30,197
What am I gonna do?

838
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:33,825
Go get Cassandra.
Del and I will run the concert.

839
01:16:35,994 --> 01:16:40,499
Just get Cassandra and be back
before we start. Go, now!

840
01:16:50,258 --> 01:16:53,720
Now move it, people! Go! Go! Go!

841
01:16:54,846 --> 01:16:58,517
- Hi!
- I'm kind of busy now.

842
01:16:59,267 --> 01:17:04,606
I just wanted to know if you needed
anything from the permit office.

843
01:17:08,860 --> 01:17:12,030
That's a Unix book.

844
01:17:12,114 --> 01:17:15,283
- Yeah.
- Cool.

845
01:17:34,761 --> 01:17:37,764
All right, men.
Our work here is done.

846
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:42,686
Excellent.

847
01:18:29,524 --> 01:18:33,570
Where's the First Presbyterian Church
on Gordon Street?

848
01:18:34,446 --> 01:18:37,115
- Gordon Street!
- Oh, yeah.

849
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:41,578
I once knew a girl
who lived on Gordon Street...

850
01:18:41,662 --> 01:18:45,916
but that was a long time ago,
when I was young.

851
01:18:45,999 --> 01:18:50,671
Do we have to put up with this?
I mean, can't we get a better actor?

852
01:18:50,754 --> 01:18:54,466
I know it's a small part,
but we can do better than this.

853
01:18:59,888 --> 01:19:04,643
Gordon Street?
Oh, yes, Gordon Street.

854
01:19:04,726 --> 01:19:07,938
I once knew a girl
who lived on Gordon Street.

855
01:19:08,021 --> 01:19:11,775
Long time ago,
when I was a young man.

856
01:19:11,858 --> 01:19:14,861
Not a day passes
that I don't think of her,

857
01:19:14,945 --> 01:19:20,951
and the promise I made,
which I will always keep,

858
01:19:21,034 --> 01:19:25,205
that one perfect day
on Gordon Street.

859
01:19:25,288 --> 01:19:28,458
That's, five blocks up, two over.

860
01:19:30,669 --> 01:19:32,713
Thank you.

861
01:19:59,865 --> 01:20:04,619
- Welcome to Aurora!
- Eat me!

862
01:20:06,788 --> 01:20:10,625
Not just a place,
but a state of mind.

863
01:20:58,548 --> 01:21:01,385
Oh, Jesus. God, no.

864
01:21:09,685 --> 01:21:12,604
Hi. Sorry!

865
01:21:12,688 --> 01:21:15,857
Sorry, everybody! Wrong wedding!

866
01:21:15,941 --> 01:21:17,651
Who's he?

867
01:21:42,092 --> 01:21:44,970
Oh, Jesus. God, no.

868
01:21:50,308 --> 01:21:53,729
What an asshole!

869
01:22:10,454 --> 01:22:12,289
Son of a bitch!

870
01:22:13,790 --> 01:22:17,669
- Son of a bitch!
- Son of a bitch!

871
01:22:32,934 --> 01:22:35,520
You punk. You crazy punk.

872
01:23:13,809 --> 01:23:15,018
Stevenson Park! Step on it!

873
01:23:16,937 --> 01:23:23,985
- One, one, two, two, two.
- Check two! Check two!

874
01:23:24,069 --> 01:23:30,200
OK. We have some word that
there is some bad red rope liquorice

875
01:23:30,283 --> 01:23:32,953
circulating in the crowd.

876
01:23:33,036 --> 01:23:37,499
Repeat - stay away
from the red rope liquorice.

877
01:23:37,582 --> 01:23:44,172
Do not bite any off and chew it.
It could cause a dental emergency.

878
01:23:51,847 --> 01:23:53,807
Excuse me. Excuse me.

879
01:24:03,191 --> 01:24:06,987
- Guys, huh?
- Wayne, Cassandra, you made it!

880
01:24:08,864 --> 01:24:10,574
This is great!

881
01:24:14,119 --> 01:24:16,455
What'll we do?
The bands haven't showed.

882
01:24:16,538 --> 01:24:20,417
Jim Morrison said,
"If you book them, they will come."

883
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:22,586
It doesn't look too good.

884
01:24:25,464 --> 01:24:30,635
Jim? Jim!

885
01:24:35,265 --> 01:24:40,020
- We really are in the desert.
- Sh'yeah, no guff.

886
01:24:42,731 --> 01:24:47,194
- Jim Morrison.
- Told you so, man.

887
01:24:47,277 --> 01:24:51,531
- How can I help you?
- None of the bands have shown up.

888
01:24:51,615 --> 01:24:53,825
I know,
and they're not gonna show up.

889
01:24:53,909 --> 01:24:56,953
Then why were we
supposed to put on a concert?

890
01:24:57,037 --> 01:25:00,457
Because you had to try
and do something with your life.

891
01:25:00,540 --> 01:25:02,417
But it was a failure.

892
01:25:02,501 --> 01:25:04,294
Whether you won or lost,

893
01:25:04,378 --> 01:25:07,881
what's important is that
you gave it your best shot.

894
01:25:07,964 --> 01:25:09,341
Sorry, man.

895
01:25:09,424 --> 01:25:11,551
- OK.
- All right.

896
01:25:11,635 --> 01:25:15,597
You'll think of something.
It's your movie.

897
01:25:15,681 --> 01:25:18,183
Thanks a pantload, Chet.

898
01:25:20,102 --> 01:25:25,399
Wayne, where are we?
How do we get back?

899
01:25:45,836 --> 01:25:48,964
We don't want to end the movie
this way, do we?

900
01:25:49,047 --> 01:25:54,761
Good call. If we're gonna go down,
let's at least go down in glory.

901
01:25:54,845 --> 01:25:57,764
Let's do the
Thelma and Louise ending. Yeah!

902
01:26:11,111 --> 01:26:16,783
- Let's just keep going, Wayne.
- OK, Garth.

903
01:26:33,258 --> 01:26:36,303
We don't want to end
the movie like this.

904
01:26:36,386 --> 01:26:39,222
Yeah. Let's do the happy ending.

905
01:26:46,063 --> 01:26:48,357
The bands haven't shown up.
What'll we do?

906
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:50,859
What are we going to do, you guys?

907
01:27:09,711 --> 01:27:13,006
- You made it. Excellent!
- Welcome to Waynestock.

908
01:27:16,051 --> 01:27:17,678
All right.

909
01:27:56,925 --> 01:28:01,096
Jim, why was I supposed to
put on this concert?

910
01:28:01,179 --> 01:28:05,642
Because you had to learn
that it doesn't matter what you do,

911
01:28:05,726 --> 01:28:07,978
Cassandra loves you for who you are.

912
01:28:08,061 --> 01:28:13,775
And that being an adult
means facing responsibility,

913
01:28:13,859 --> 01:28:16,778
yet still taking the time
to have fun.

914
01:28:16,862 --> 01:28:20,490
Right. It's sort of like
coming home on Friday night

915
01:28:20,574 --> 01:28:22,826
and doing your homework right away,

916
01:28:22,909 --> 01:28:26,246
so your Saturday night
is free to just party.

917
01:28:26,330 --> 01:28:28,957
No, I like the way I said it better.

918
01:28:41,928 --> 01:28:44,056
Excuse me.

919
01:28:44,139 --> 01:28:47,517
Would you open the gate, please?
I have to get in there.

920
01:28:47,601 --> 01:28:50,729
- You can't come in.
- My girlfriend's in there.

921
01:28:50,812 --> 01:28:53,231
A lot of people's girlfriends
are in there.

922
01:31:44,361 --> 01:31:49,282
- Don't cry.
- Yeah, we're gonna clean it up. OK?

923
01:32:03,505 --> 01:32:07,426
- See?
- See?
