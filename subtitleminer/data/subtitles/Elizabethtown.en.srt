00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:38,956
Welcome back, boys.

2
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,460
<i>As somebody once said...</i>

3
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:45,754
<i>there's a difference between a failure...</i>

4
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:48,298
<i>and a fiasco.</i>

5
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:38,307
Watch your head.

6
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,354
I'm fine.

7
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:48,525
<i>A failure is simply the non-presence</i>
<i>of success.</i>

8
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:55,657
<i>Any fool can accomplish failure.</i>

9
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:56,950
I'm fine.

10
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:03,248
I'm fine.

11
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:04,875
What the hell's he doing here?

12
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:07,169
<i>But a fiasco...</i>

13
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:12,299
<i>A fiasco is a disaster</i>
<i>of mythic proportions.</i>

14
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:16,136
<i>A fiasco is a folktale told to others...</i>

15
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:19,556
<i>that makes other people</i>
<i>feel more alive...</i>

16
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:23,018
<i>because it didn't happen to them.</i>

17
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,103
I'm fine.

18
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:32,402
I'm fine.

19
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:34,738
I'll take you to Phil so you don't get lost.

20
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:40,077
<i>Mercury Worldwide Shoes,</i>
<i>which is actually Phil...</i>

21
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:44,748
<i>contains some of America's</i>
<i>finest artists' masterworks...</i>

22
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:49,253
<i>seen only by people</i>
<i>heading for very important meetings...</i>

23
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:50,879
<i>a promotion...</i>

24
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:52,756
<i>or otherwise.</i>

25
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:59,221
<i>"We are not just employees,"</i>
<i>as Phil once said.</i>

26
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:02,266
<i>"We are denizens of greatness."</i>

27
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:08,856
<i>Phil says, "The world is full of those</i>
<i>who achieve through negativity...</i>

28
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:10,315
<i>"or theft.</i>

29
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:13,402
<i>"We succeed through original thought."</i>

30
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:19,575
<i>A shoe is not just a shoe.</i>

31
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,910
<i>It connects us to the Earth.</i>

32
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,705
<i>The right shoe can transport us...</i>

33
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:27,749
<i>make us believe</i>
<i>we are capable of more.</i>

34
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:32,588
<i>But there are sacrifices</i>
<i>for a goal like pure greatness.</i>

35
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:36,258
<i>Like birthdays</i>
<i>or last Christmas with my family.</i>

36
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:39,094
...through Christ our Lord. Amen.

37
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,680
Dig in.
And no making fun of my cooking.

38
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:44,057
- This must be homemade.
- Oh, Dad.

39
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:46,643
<i>Though we sometimes celebrate</i>
<i>odd things at Mercury...</i>

40
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:49,396
<i>like the day the Italians invented rubber.</i>

41
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:52,357
<i>Which they didn't, of course.</i>
<i>But that's beside the point.</i>

42
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:54,568
Where exactly is Drew, anyway?

43
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:06,413
We've contained magic in a shoe!

44
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:16,632
<i>It was meant to approximate</i>
<i>walking on a cloud.</i>

45
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:30,938
Hey, if you ever need anything
around here...

46
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,689
I'm your girl.

47
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:50,040
<i>Any true student</i>
<i>of functional shoe design...</i>

48
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:52,501
<i>is also a student of Phil himself.</i>

49
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:54,378
<i>He is a master.</i>

50
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:58,006
<i>And Phil's innate wisdom</i>
<i>of what people want and need...</i>

51
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,384
<i>has never failed to date.</i>

52
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:01,635
I'm fine.

53
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:04,680
<i>He's also obsessed</i>
<i>with the number two.</i>

54
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:09,935
<i>These are Phil's prized</i>
<i>two Norman Rockwells.</i>

55
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:12,896
<i>The pair of paintings that once hung</i>
<i>outside the White House office...</i>

56
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,606
<i>of John F. Kennedy.</i>

57
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,442
<i>And yes, the two treasured doors...</i>

58
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:20,404
<i>Phil once purchased from a church</i>
<i>on vacation in Tunisia...</i>

59
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:24,449
<i>and had sent back home for a total cost</i>
<i>too enormous to mention.</i>

60
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,786
<i>$762,000.</i>

61
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:29,204
Each.

62
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,915
Just two more minutes
and I can send you in.

63
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,585
<i>Because we have a moment here...</i>

64
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:38,380
<i>let me tell you that I have</i>
<i>recently become a secret connoisseur...</i>

65
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:40,007
<i>of last looks.</i>

66
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,052
<i>You know the way people look at you</i>
<i>when they believe it's for the last time?</i>

67
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:47,389
<i>I've started collecting these looks and...</i>

68
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,183
Okay, he's ready for you.

69
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:55,898
<i>There's one right now.</i>

70
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:08,994
How are you, Drew?

71
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:13,957
I wanted to jump out of the window
of that helicopter...

72
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:16,084
and just splatter on the trees,
to tell you the truth.

73
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,669
Don't do that.

74
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,964
It's only money.

75
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:30,182
The American psyche is in turmoil,
Drew, and we have miscalculated.

76
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:31,725
I'm sorry.

77
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:36,605
I have no rulebook for this situation.

78
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:42,444
They tell me
that we are about to lose 972...

79
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,823
million dollars.

80
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:49,952
I am...

81
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:55,624
ill-equipped
in the philosophies of failure.

82
00:06:58,961 --> 00:07:00,003
Walk with me, Drew.

83
00:07:00,963 --> 00:07:02,714
My basketball team.

84
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:06,844
They don't even know yet.

85
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:13,600
My Global Environmental Watchdog
project will have to go.

86
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:16,603
Sweet people.

87
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:19,523
We could have saved the planet...

88
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:21,483
but...

89
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:25,863
How do I make the concept
of $972,000,000...

90
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:27,781
more real to you?

91
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:30,909
It's the operating budget
of a midsize country...

92
00:07:30,993 --> 00:07:32,619
a small civilization.

93
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:33,871
It's big!

94
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:36,790
It's so big...

95
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:41,628
you could round it off to a billion dollars.

96
00:07:47,176 --> 00:07:48,927
I cry a lot lately.

97
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:51,763
The promise of a global future...

98
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:54,850
pinned to a groundbreaking shoe,
your design...

99
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:58,270
with a new form of material,
launched this week to great fanfare.

100
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:03,275
And now, meeting a growing
international roar of laughter...

101
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:05,319
and rejection.

102
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:10,199
Enough to cause this memo...

103
00:08:12,743 --> 00:08:16,496
from Jeffrey Barlow, CEO of DCS.

104
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,458
"This once highly-anticipated product...

105
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:24,463
"may actually cause an entire
generation to return to bare feet."

106
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,599
We are about to enter...

107
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,852
a free-fall plunge.

108
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:43,815
And the sound you hear
is the sound of shit hitting the fan.

109
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:47,569
Globally.

110
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:50,280
You hear it?

111
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,954
I wish there was something I could do.

112
00:08:57,246 --> 00:08:59,623
Actually, there is.

113
00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:03,585
In a room downstairs is a reporter
from <i>Global Business Today.</i>

114
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:06,255
We need to make him understand...

115
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,715
we hired you
from our National Scholarship Program.

116
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:12,052
We supported,
invested in your brilliance.

117
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:14,930
This was a very creative endeavor...

118
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,975
and I think you should stand up...

119
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:22,813
for your incredible work.

120
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:29,736
You okay?

121
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:31,905
I'm...

122
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:42,332
It's a little bit like knowing the plane's
going down before anyone else, isn't it?

123
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,961
- When does this run, a week?
- A week.

124
00:09:46,295 --> 00:09:48,338
Come Sunday evening,
it'll be on the stands.

125
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:51,049
Any last words?

126
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,051
<i>And in that moment, I knew.</i>

127
00:09:53,135 --> 00:09:55,554
I know we hired you
at the last minute but...

128
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:56,847
<i>Success...</i>

129
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:01,727
<i>Success, not greatness...</i>

130
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:06,356
<i>was the only god</i>
<i>the entire world served.</i>

131
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:19,828
Home sweet home.

132
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:39,097
<i>Eight years. Night and day.</i>

133
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:40,682
<i>Can you imagine?</i>

134
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:44,394
<i>An entire life wrapped up in a shoe.</i>

135
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:34,505
Yello?

136
00:12:35,172 --> 00:12:36,715
Drew? It's your sister.

137
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,259
<i>I have some really bad news.</i>

138
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:41,929
Could you call me tomorrow?

139
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:44,097
No.

140
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:46,141
- Could you call me a little later?
<i>- No, honey.</i>

141
00:12:47,643 --> 00:12:49,102
Dad died!

142
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:54,650
<i>He had a heart attack back in Kentucky.</i>

143
00:12:57,653 --> 00:12:59,988
<i>He was still visiting Uncle Dale.</i>

144
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:03,450
Mom is in total shock.

145
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:06,203
You have to handle this.

146
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:08,914
<i>You're the oldest.</i>

147
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:12,251
You're the responsible one.

148
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:55,294
I don't know why he went to Kentucky.
I don't know what the attraction was.

149
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:56,378
He was born there.

150
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:57,838
They never liked me there.
They never have.

151
00:13:57,963 --> 00:13:59,256
Drew will take care of everything.

152
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:01,466
Honey, you understand I can't go
because of the baby.

153
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,677
- I'll be back in two days.
- I'll man the phones.

154
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:06,430
I'll always be the one
that snatched him away from them.

155
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:08,932
The two sides of this family
have never integrated well...

156
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:11,310
so don't expect to make a lot of friends
when you go there.

157
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:13,478
- Drew doesn't make friends, Mom.
- I have friends.

158
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:16,023
- Do you have the blue suit?
- I have the blue suit.

159
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:17,691
He loved that silly blue suit.

160
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:20,027
God only knows
if I made him truly happy.

161
00:14:20,152 --> 00:14:22,237
I'll call from Kentucky.
I'll be there in the morning.

162
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:23,864
- We have a plan!
- We have a plan...

163
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:25,115
and you hold your head up high...

164
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,285
because don't you forget, you go back
there as the most successful man...

165
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:30,495
in the history of this family.
Don't let them try anything.

166
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:33,040
Oh, my God. I have to call people.

167
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:35,334
I have to clean out the office,
I'm a widow!

168
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:39,171
We'll figure this out, we'll figure this out.
Just get Dad home. Hurry.

169
00:14:39,254 --> 00:14:43,592
I was still waiting for everything to start,
and now it's over.

170
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:47,221
I'll bring him home.

171
00:14:47,346 --> 00:14:49,973
Wait, wait! Stay close.
Come, come, come.

172
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:52,476
Now, what was it that Dad always said?

173
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:56,230
- If it wasn't this...
- It would be something else.

174
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:59,358
Now, you go.
You go and you make him proud.

175
00:14:59,483 --> 00:15:03,070
And you call and tell me
what's going on, okay? All right.

176
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,657
<i>I would go to Kentucky...</i>

177
00:15:06,782 --> 00:15:09,910
<i>put my father in the blue suit,</i>
<i>bring him home...</i>

178
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:12,746
<i>and then get back on that bike.</i>

179
00:15:13,664 --> 00:15:16,375
<i>Nothing would stop the plan.</i>

180
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:16,476
Sir.

181
00:16:17,603 --> 00:16:18,604
Sir.

182
00:16:19,897 --> 00:16:23,400
By flying this flight,
you've helped save all our jobs.

183
00:16:23,525 --> 00:16:26,486
Definitely mine.
Maybe even the entire airline.

184
00:16:27,196 --> 00:16:31,158
We would like to reward you
with a free seat in first class.

185
00:16:31,617 --> 00:16:32,659
I'm fine.

186
00:16:36,205 --> 00:16:39,041
Okay, let me try it like this.

187
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:41,585
I'm really tired.
Please don't make me keep walking...

188
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:44,421
all the way back down here
all night long.

189
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:53,222
Louisville, Kentucky, huh?
Home, business, or family?

190
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:54,932
My dad.

191
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:57,392
Where does he live in Louisville?

192
00:16:57,935 --> 00:16:59,436
Actually, he's near Louisville.

193
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:01,188
Louisville.

194
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:07,236
He's in Elizabethtown.

195
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:09,112
Oh, good.
I hope someone's driving you...

196
00:17:09,238 --> 00:17:13,659
'cause the roads around there
are hopelessly and gloriously confusing.

197
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,830
I'll keep that in mind.

198
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:24,920
I'll draw you a quick map.

199
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:30,884
I mean, I'm so happy we're sitting here
having this conversation...

200
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:32,970
at 3:00 a.m., or whatever time it is.

201
00:17:33,095 --> 00:17:36,431
You know, it's such a great time.
Everyone's sleeping but us.

202
00:17:36,557 --> 00:17:40,394
It's really nice to have a conversation
with you and that you're really listening.

203
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:42,563
<i>I feel like I can really talk to you...</i>

204
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:48,235
So, you want to get to 264,
and then you want to not miss 60B.

205
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:50,279
I'm going to be obnoxious about that.

206
00:17:50,404 --> 00:17:54,491
Bens are strangely delightful
and very intuitive.

207
00:17:54,783 --> 00:17:57,452
Complex. Almost too complex
to be around.

208
00:17:58,287 --> 00:18:00,873
- Do you know any Bens?
- I know one Ben.

209
00:18:01,957 --> 00:18:03,834
I'm a student of names.

210
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:06,545
For example, what's your dad's name?

211
00:18:06,712 --> 00:18:07,713
Mitchell.

212
00:18:07,796 --> 00:18:09,464
- Mitchell.
- Yeah.

213
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,093
Or Mitch?

214
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:16,430
Mitchell. Sometimes Mitch.

215
00:18:18,307 --> 00:18:20,100
Son of a Mitch.

216
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:23,437
And today I was fired by a Phil.

217
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:27,232
Phil? Phils are dangerous.

218
00:18:27,858 --> 00:18:30,110
Phils are less predictable than Bens.

219
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:38,660
And your girlfriend is a...

220
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:40,412
Ellen.

221
00:18:43,415 --> 00:18:45,876
- How's that going?
- Sort of a wait-and-see.

222
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:49,129
- Oh, yeah?
- But then I waited and I saw.

223
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:50,923
I was gonna say.

224
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:55,177
I have never had a good experience
with an Ellen or a Phil.

225
00:18:55,511 --> 00:18:58,847
- How about with a Mitch?
- Never met a Mitch I didn't like.

226
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:03,685
Fun. Full of life, you know?
You know what I mean when I say fun?

227
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:07,981
Like you want to be a part
of Mitch's club.

228
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:10,526
Am I close?

229
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:12,778
Close.

230
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,573
He's okay, right?

231
00:19:16,782 --> 00:19:18,492
Yeah. He's...

232
00:19:30,712 --> 00:19:32,005
He's fine.

233
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:39,221
You give him a big old hug for me.

234
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:45,394
I'm Claire, by the way.

235
00:19:45,686 --> 00:19:46,687
Drew.

236
00:19:46,812 --> 00:19:49,022
- Nice.
- Same to you.

237
00:19:49,481 --> 00:19:50,607
Please.

238
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:53,068
I'll let you sleep. Here's your map.

239
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:56,238
Let me take this.

240
00:19:58,198 --> 00:19:59,658
I can handle this.

241
00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:02,536
Let go.

242
00:20:29,438 --> 00:20:31,565
<i>I am not asleep.</i>

243
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:36,403
<i>I'm not.</i>

244
00:20:39,531 --> 00:20:42,242
<i>I won't really be able to sleep.</i>

245
00:20:42,451 --> 00:20:44,745
<i>I won't really be able to sleep.</i>

246
00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:47,372
Okay. Ready to go, Drew?

247
00:20:47,456 --> 00:20:48,957
<i>I'm not asleep.</i>

248
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:50,792
<i>Blue suit.</i>

249
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:52,252
<i>Losing the business.</i>

250
00:20:52,336 --> 00:20:53,420
<i>Louisville.</i>

251
00:20:53,545 --> 00:20:54,713
<i>I'm not asleep.</i>

252
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:56,089
<i>We'll go next year.</i>

253
00:20:56,215 --> 00:20:57,341
<i>Come back.</i>

254
00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:24,910
<i>One billion dollars.</i>

255
00:21:29,581 --> 00:21:30,916
Good morning.

256
00:21:31,834 --> 00:21:33,794
And congratulations, Drew.

257
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:36,964
You've earned your wings
as our ten millionth passenger.

258
00:21:37,172 --> 00:21:41,176
And here is a coupon
for any four-diamond hotel...

259
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:43,178
in the greater western Kentucky area.

260
00:21:44,346 --> 00:21:47,349
Better move quickly.
Lots of people behind you.

261
00:21:54,189 --> 00:21:56,441
- Well, thank you.
- Absolutely.

262
00:21:56,525 --> 00:21:58,151
And good luck with Ben.

263
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:03,073
Look, I know
I may never see you again...

264
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:06,451
but we are intrepid.

265
00:22:07,077 --> 00:22:08,537
We carry on.

266
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:19,464
Drew!

267
00:22:22,217 --> 00:22:25,345
Rental cars around the corner.
You'll see the signs.

268
00:22:25,429 --> 00:22:29,683
Bluegrass Parkway turns into exit 60B.
Don't forget, 60B.

269
00:22:30,267 --> 00:22:31,977
Okay. Thanks.

270
00:22:36,857 --> 00:22:38,525
You okay to drive?

271
00:22:39,401 --> 00:22:40,652
I'm fine.

272
00:22:42,654 --> 00:22:44,031
60B!

273
00:22:51,121 --> 00:22:52,581
60B!

274
00:23:53,475 --> 00:23:54,768
Uncle Dale.

275
00:23:55,185 --> 00:23:58,021
I'm in Louisville. Just landed.

276
00:23:58,438 --> 00:23:59,982
I'm on the road.

277
00:24:01,066 --> 00:24:03,360
60B. Yeah.

278
00:24:04,403 --> 00:24:05,821
I have a map.

279
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:12,703
And I'll be there by 2:00.

280
00:24:19,084 --> 00:24:20,502
I have the blue suit.

281
00:24:32,014 --> 00:24:33,515
Where's 60B?

282
00:24:36,351 --> 00:24:37,644
Shit, man.

283
00:24:39,688 --> 00:24:40,689
Oh, man!

284
00:24:41,064 --> 00:24:42,983
Did I miss 60B?

285
00:24:43,775 --> 00:24:46,153
Did I miss 60B?

286
00:24:46,862 --> 00:24:48,989
Did I miss 60B?

287
00:24:52,576 --> 00:24:55,162
Did I miss 60B?

288
00:25:01,668 --> 00:25:02,628
Elizabethtown.

289
00:25:04,004 --> 00:25:05,964
Elizabethtown! Yes!

290
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:10,677
Elizabethtown! We're in!
Oh, yeah. Okay!

291
00:26:44,146 --> 00:26:45,772
Oh, yeah.

292
00:26:48,984 --> 00:26:50,027
Jessie?

293
00:26:50,986 --> 00:26:52,112
Cuz.

294
00:26:57,326 --> 00:26:58,452
Cuz.

295
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:04,791
This loss will be met
by a hurricane of love.

296
00:27:11,673 --> 00:27:14,968
Charles Dean,
meet grown-up Drew Baylor.

297
00:27:15,427 --> 00:27:17,179
Drew, it's good to see you.

298
00:27:17,387 --> 00:27:19,097
Thank you. My condolences.

299
00:27:19,389 --> 00:27:21,642
And here's my dad, your Uncle Dale.

300
00:27:22,017 --> 00:27:23,852
Wonderful to see you again.

301
00:27:25,687 --> 00:27:28,190
Well, Drew, this is Mitch's plot.

302
00:27:29,191 --> 00:27:33,612
And it has been in your family
for 272 years.

303
00:27:34,696 --> 00:27:36,323
Now, I've endeavored...

304
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:40,536
to keep this area here
clear for your daddy.

305
00:27:41,662 --> 00:27:46,416
We're still discussing that issue.
There is a possibility of cremation.

306
00:27:51,505 --> 00:27:54,967
Now, here are some of your daddy's
personal things.

307
00:27:55,884 --> 00:27:57,719
The brown wallet.

308
00:27:58,178 --> 00:28:01,181
And here's his ring from West Point.

309
00:28:03,016 --> 00:28:05,978
Now I don't know how y'all feel
out there in California...

310
00:28:06,186 --> 00:28:09,064
but West Point sure does matter
around here.

311
00:28:09,398 --> 00:28:11,024
It matters a lot.

312
00:28:11,859 --> 00:28:14,319
Even though we now live in Oregon.

313
00:28:19,658 --> 00:28:21,285
Everybody.

314
00:28:21,493 --> 00:28:24,872
This is Mitch's boy from California.

315
00:28:25,247 --> 00:28:27,332
One of the California Baylors.

316
00:28:27,958 --> 00:28:29,251
This is Drew.

317
00:28:31,253 --> 00:28:35,757
And just like your daddy was,
we are all very excited...

318
00:28:36,592 --> 00:28:40,262
about your eight-year triumph
with that beautiful shoe.

319
00:28:49,938 --> 00:28:51,899
My condolences to all.

320
00:28:55,235 --> 00:28:58,572
No, sir. I'm not going to let you feel bad
'cause that was from your heart...

321
00:28:58,655 --> 00:29:00,741
but let them say condolences to you.

322
00:29:00,866 --> 00:29:04,661
- I thought condolences was...
- It's incoming. It's an incoming phrase.

323
00:29:28,143 --> 00:29:30,270
Did I not capture your daddy?

324
00:29:32,981 --> 00:29:35,067
I don't know what the word is.

325
00:29:35,984 --> 00:29:38,195
It's just a look I never saw before.

326
00:29:39,905 --> 00:29:41,198
What's the word?

327
00:29:42,658 --> 00:29:46,954
Drew, if you just move around a bit...

328
00:29:48,997 --> 00:29:51,124
you will see different aspects.

329
00:29:56,672 --> 00:29:58,215
Go ahead and cry.

330
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,230
<i>What's the word?</i>

331
00:30:34,543 --> 00:30:35,919
Whimsical.

332
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:40,632
The word is whimsical.

333
00:30:50,142 --> 00:30:51,101
Hey...

334
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,061
why not?

335
00:30:54,229 --> 00:30:55,689
Whimsical.

336
00:32:05,008 --> 00:32:07,886
- Turkey hash brown casserole.
- It's Russ!

337
00:32:12,641 --> 00:32:15,102
Aunt Dora, Aunt Dora.

338
00:32:17,521 --> 00:32:20,649
Aunt Dora, look what I found.

339
00:32:21,817 --> 00:32:24,361
Oh, my God!

340
00:32:27,698 --> 00:32:30,242
Look at Mitch's baby!

341
00:32:30,325 --> 00:32:33,245
You look just like your daddy.
And who's been feeding you?

342
00:32:33,579 --> 00:32:35,581
Wait just a minute. I gotta talk to Drew.

343
00:32:35,789 --> 00:32:38,959
- We hope you're gonna stay for a while.
- You're a credit to Etown.

344
00:32:43,505 --> 00:32:45,549
Sorry about your dad.

345
00:32:47,801 --> 00:32:49,052
This is your blood.

346
00:32:51,889 --> 00:32:55,642
And that's Samson, my son.
Clearly up to no good.

347
00:32:56,351 --> 00:32:57,394
Samson.

348
00:32:58,604 --> 00:33:02,065
Uncle Mitch always wanted us to meet.
Everybody says we look alike.

349
00:33:04,943 --> 00:33:07,529
Weird, huh? It's like looking in a mirror.

350
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:12,451
Hi, Drew. I'm Connie.
I was your daddy's first girlfriend and...

351
00:33:12,534 --> 00:33:14,536
Hi, Drew, I'm Charlie.

352
00:33:14,661 --> 00:33:16,496
- I'm a huge fan of shoes...
- My son. My son.

353
00:33:16,622 --> 00:33:18,332
...and the work you've done
in the shoe business.

354
00:33:18,415 --> 00:33:19,625
- We'll talk.
- Absolutely.

355
00:33:19,708 --> 00:33:21,960
We got memorial plans to discuss.

356
00:33:22,044 --> 00:33:24,379
Your daddy was one of my
10 most favorite people.

357
00:33:24,505 --> 00:33:26,465
Sure did miss him
when he went out West.

358
00:33:26,548 --> 00:33:28,383
Drew, I'm E. Russell Marlowe...

359
00:33:28,509 --> 00:33:30,844
with the American Legion
in Bardstown, Kentucky.

360
00:33:30,928 --> 00:33:33,180
Drew, I want to sign you up
with the American Legion...

361
00:33:33,263 --> 00:33:34,598
or the Sons of the Legion.

362
00:33:34,723 --> 00:33:39,019
And I got a hat that I want to give you
as a souvenir, in honor of your dad...

363
00:33:48,946 --> 00:33:51,365
Bill Banyon's not coming, is he?

364
00:33:51,448 --> 00:33:53,742
Bill Banyon is not coming.

365
00:34:08,006 --> 00:34:11,051
Bad dog! Stop that!

366
00:34:12,094 --> 00:34:13,554
Bad dog!

367
00:34:15,097 --> 00:34:16,723
- Samson?
- What a mess!

368
00:34:25,232 --> 00:34:26,859
So, come on in.

369
00:34:26,942 --> 00:34:30,195
You know, it's not every day I invite
good-looking men to my bedroom...

370
00:34:30,279 --> 00:34:33,156
but I just wanted you
to meet your family...

371
00:34:33,282 --> 00:34:34,992
the Baylors and the Conleys.

372
00:34:35,117 --> 00:34:37,244
Let's start with Dickey Conley.

373
00:34:37,369 --> 00:34:40,789
Now, he was an alcoholic.
He had a drinking problem.

374
00:34:40,914 --> 00:34:44,543
And he also had three nipples.
He had three nipples.

375
00:34:44,626 --> 00:34:46,670
And he was a poet.

376
00:34:52,801 --> 00:34:55,762
How's your mother, Drew, honey?
You know...

377
00:34:57,139 --> 00:34:59,850
I really should have a picture of her
in here.

378
00:34:59,975 --> 00:35:02,102
And this picture is...

379
00:35:02,269 --> 00:35:04,605
- Aunt Dora!
- Coming!

380
00:35:04,813 --> 00:35:09,359
Lena, just watch over it.
Two more minutes! I'm coming!

381
00:35:09,985 --> 00:35:12,529
This was the last picture taken
of your daddy.

382
00:35:12,654 --> 00:35:14,781
This was just three days ago, Drew.

383
00:35:14,865 --> 00:35:17,034
He was the most loving man.

384
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:19,119
- Dora!
- Coming!

385
00:35:19,244 --> 00:35:21,788
Honey, you stay as long as you need to.

386
00:35:48,941 --> 00:35:50,150
Samson.

387
00:35:55,197 --> 00:35:56,323
My God!

388
00:35:57,950 --> 00:35:59,535
- Oh, man.
- Was he driving that?

389
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:01,036
Samson, you all right, boy?

390
00:36:01,161 --> 00:36:02,871
- You all right?
- You all right?

391
00:36:03,956 --> 00:36:05,666
Oh, my God!

392
00:36:05,874 --> 00:36:08,627
Where the hell's his father?
That's what I want to know.

393
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,212
What happened?

394
00:36:10,295 --> 00:36:14,091
- Hey, who taught you how to drive?
- What the hell do you mean?

395
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,219
- What do you mean?
- You gotta keep your eye on him!

396
00:36:24,393 --> 00:36:25,394
So!

397
00:36:28,272 --> 00:36:31,775
Y'all obviously made a group decision
not to call and invite me.

398
00:36:37,447 --> 00:36:40,325
Hi! Bill Banyon. How are you?
Good to see you.

399
00:36:42,494 --> 00:36:44,913
Bill Banyon. How are you?
Good to see you.

400
00:36:45,956 --> 00:36:48,917
I hear Drew Baylor's here, is that right?
Hi, Connie, how are you?

401
00:36:49,042 --> 00:36:50,002
I'm fine.

402
00:36:51,211 --> 00:36:53,589
- Is this Samson?
- It is. This is Samson.

403
00:36:53,714 --> 00:36:56,466
Come here, Samson! How you doing?
Give me a big boy hug!

404
00:37:02,097 --> 00:37:03,724
I'm so sorry.

405
00:37:04,433 --> 00:37:08,395
I should just go over to the kitchen.
Good to see you. Cute kid.

406
00:37:09,271 --> 00:37:11,481
Drew, can I have your autograph,
please?

407
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,025
Of course.

408
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:22,284
Where can I find an original model
of Adidas SL 72s?

409
00:37:23,535 --> 00:37:26,121
That boy is looking for rules from you!

410
00:37:26,997 --> 00:37:28,707
Blame me, everybody does.

411
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:31,418
You can't be a kid and raise a kid.

412
00:37:31,627 --> 00:37:35,797
Dad, I'm taking this moment to tell you
that I'm untraditional.

413
00:37:35,923 --> 00:37:39,718
When we celebrate the life of Mitch,
we're gonna do it with no tears...

414
00:37:39,801 --> 00:37:43,388
we're gonna do it with excitement,
and I'll take care of everything.

415
00:37:43,472 --> 00:37:45,182
- All right.
- Hear, hear.

416
00:37:45,724 --> 00:37:49,603
We know what's up, and it's shoes.
We're so much alike!

417
00:37:49,728 --> 00:37:51,897
I teach him things
that everybody should know.

418
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:55,150
I teach him about Abraham Lincoln
and Ronnie Van Zant...

419
00:37:55,651 --> 00:37:59,279
because in my house,
they are both of equal importance.

420
00:38:00,614 --> 00:38:02,324
You don't get what I'm saying.

421
00:38:03,784 --> 00:38:07,496
You can't be buddies with your own son.

422
00:38:21,677 --> 00:38:24,972
Beautiful night. Does it ever cool off?

423
00:38:26,098 --> 00:38:29,685
No, this time of year,
it's hotter than the hinges of hell.

424
00:38:30,185 --> 00:38:31,895
We got stars, though.

425
00:38:44,575 --> 00:38:46,869
Gotta say I'm surprised your mom
didn't make it.

426
00:38:48,704 --> 00:38:50,706
Yeah, she's pretty broken up.

427
00:38:51,081 --> 00:38:53,417
She sends her love
to everybody, though.

428
00:38:54,168 --> 00:38:56,503
Yeah. I don't blame her.

429
00:38:57,004 --> 00:39:00,716
Around here, their favorite thing to do
is to get offended by something small...

430
00:39:00,841 --> 00:39:02,926
and hold on to it for 50 years.

431
00:39:03,677 --> 00:39:06,305
Of course, you and your dad were close.

432
00:39:07,222 --> 00:39:10,475
Very close.
And I knew him very, very well.

433
00:39:11,185 --> 00:39:12,644
He was my dad.

434
00:39:13,187 --> 00:39:16,523
We were actually going to drive here
together this year.

435
00:39:17,107 --> 00:39:20,527
Then it became next year and no.

436
00:39:22,446 --> 00:39:25,073
I knew him very well. Very, very well.

437
00:39:25,991 --> 00:39:27,117
Very well.

438
00:39:27,618 --> 00:39:30,579
Yeah, I don't know my dad very well,
either.

439
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:33,081
That was my band.

440
00:39:34,666 --> 00:39:39,379
This was the show we opened
for Lynyrd fucking Skynyrd.

441
00:39:40,589 --> 00:39:43,258
- Two of the original members.
- Cool.

442
00:39:46,929 --> 00:39:48,180
Ruckus.

443
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:51,683
Keep going.

444
00:39:52,226 --> 00:39:53,310
Keep going.

445
00:39:54,144 --> 00:39:56,980
Right below the reggae tribute.
Look at that.

446
00:39:58,857 --> 00:39:59,858
Ruckus.

447
00:40:00,275 --> 00:40:02,528
Well, we almost opened for them.

448
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:07,574
It's a really long story. We never played,
and we never played since.

449
00:40:08,492 --> 00:40:10,410
And now you fix computers.

450
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:16,917
<i>All those postcards I sent</i>
<i>to Birmingham</i>

451
00:40:18,168 --> 00:40:23,090
<i>All the way from those windows</i>
<i>of Amsterdam</i>

452
00:40:24,508 --> 00:40:28,762
<i>Copped a gram from Dapper Sam</i>

453
00:40:29,179 --> 00:40:33,725
<i>Just a four letter man in another jam</i>

454
00:40:34,476 --> 00:40:35,978
<i>Oh yeah</i>

455
00:41:32,284 --> 00:41:35,370
Welcome to the Louisville Brown Hotel.
How long will you be staying with us?

456
00:41:35,495 --> 00:41:36,705
Two nights.

457
00:41:37,372 --> 00:41:39,541
That coupon I have not seen.

458
00:41:39,875 --> 00:41:42,461
You with the Hasboro Wedding?
Chuck and Cindy?

459
00:41:42,586 --> 00:41:44,046
I'm leaving Friday.

460
00:41:45,047 --> 00:41:46,006
Okay.

461
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:50,302
Put it on my company card. Let it rip.

462
00:42:03,148 --> 00:42:04,816
We're not married yet.

463
00:42:06,151 --> 00:42:07,528
Hey, Rebecca.

464
00:42:07,653 --> 00:42:10,656
Don't change the schedule
or Cindy will freak out!

465
00:42:10,781 --> 00:42:12,991
She's been planning this for a year.

466
00:42:14,201 --> 00:42:17,579
Don't forget,
there's a rehearsal dinner in...

467
00:42:28,298 --> 00:42:29,842
Chuck and Cindy.

468
00:42:41,603 --> 00:42:42,938
"Lovin' life."

469
00:42:48,151 --> 00:42:50,153
Heather? Pick up, sis. I'm exhausted.

470
00:42:50,279 --> 00:42:54,116
I'm at the Brown Hotel in Louisville.
Call me on the cell.

471
00:42:54,908 --> 00:42:56,660
Hey, Mom, are you there?

472
00:43:01,832 --> 00:43:04,418
Ellen. Hey, it's Drew. Are you there?

473
00:43:08,046 --> 00:43:09,882
Call me back.

474
00:43:10,883 --> 00:43:14,136
Somebody call me back.

475
00:43:23,979 --> 00:43:27,316
<i>That's what happens to a man when he</i>
<i>lets a woman take over, George!</i>

476
00:43:28,609 --> 00:43:31,361
<i>You listen hard, laughing boy.</i>

477
00:43:38,702 --> 00:43:40,204
<i>Did you bring the stuff?</i>

478
00:43:44,124 --> 00:43:45,626
<i>No, Blinky, no!</i>

479
00:43:46,335 --> 00:43:50,005
<i>Here's a knife that you'll really like.</i>
<i>This is my chef's knife.</i>

480
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:53,759
<i>These knives are really razor sharp!</i>

481
00:43:54,635 --> 00:43:57,763
Claire Colburn. It's Drew Baylor.

482
00:43:57,930 --> 00:44:00,307
You don't have to call me back. It's...

483
00:44:01,558 --> 00:44:02,809
It's all good.

484
00:44:02,935 --> 00:44:04,770
What am I saying?
I don't even say, "It's all good."

485
00:44:05,646 --> 00:44:06,813
Good night.

486
00:44:15,864 --> 00:44:16,865
Yello.

487
00:44:16,949 --> 00:44:17,908
You have to come home.

488
00:44:18,033 --> 00:44:20,160
Mom has decided
that she wants to learn to cook.

489
00:44:20,661 --> 00:44:21,620
Oh, no.

490
00:44:22,037 --> 00:44:23,497
<i>I'll be home soon.</i>

491
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:24,831
Have you cried yet?

492
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:27,709
A little.

493
00:44:27,835 --> 00:44:30,128
When it happens, it's gonna be for days.

494
00:44:30,212 --> 00:44:32,714
You should come home.
She's out of control.

495
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,174
Wait a second. I'll be right back.

496
00:44:34,299 --> 00:44:36,093
- Please come home.
- Hello?

497
00:44:36,218 --> 00:44:38,387
Great to hear from you.
I didn't expect for you to call.

498
00:44:38,512 --> 00:44:40,848
Then again, I did leave
a few thousand numbers.

499
00:44:41,515 --> 00:44:43,684
It's Claire Colburn. American Airlines.

500
00:44:43,767 --> 00:44:46,353
- Claire. Can I call you right back?
- I'll hold.

501
00:44:46,562 --> 00:44:47,563
Okay.

502
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:50,190
- Hello.
- Please come home.

503
00:44:51,066 --> 00:44:54,361
I want to learn to cook,
I want to learn to laugh...

504
00:44:54,528 --> 00:44:55,779
and I want to tap dance.

505
00:44:55,904 --> 00:44:57,823
<i>It will be my salvation.</i>

506
00:44:58,407 --> 00:45:00,450
She won't stop moving, Drew!

507
00:45:00,576 --> 00:45:02,619
Heather, we need a decision here.

508
00:45:02,744 --> 00:45:04,538
What's your opinion
on the whole burial issue?

509
00:45:04,663 --> 00:45:06,874
Because there's a lot of people here
with big opinions!

510
00:45:06,999 --> 00:45:10,377
And there's a problem with the blue suit
that I can't put my finger on...

511
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:12,254
Wait, wait, wait.

512
00:45:12,379 --> 00:45:13,338
How you doing, Mom?

513
00:45:13,422 --> 00:45:15,507
Great. I'm great. We are gonna make it!

514
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,969
- Hello.
- Drew, it's Ellen. You called me?

515
00:45:19,761 --> 00:45:20,762
Ellen.

516
00:45:20,888 --> 00:45:24,349
<i>Ellen? Ellen,</i>
<i>thank you for calling me back!</i>

517
00:45:24,474 --> 00:45:26,393
I'm so happy you called.

518
00:45:28,103 --> 00:45:29,605
<i>Could you just hold on one second?</i>

519
00:45:30,314 --> 00:45:32,107
- Hello?
- You need to come home, Drew.

520
00:45:32,232 --> 00:45:34,109
I'll be right back. Hello?

521
00:45:34,234 --> 00:45:35,235
<i>Drew.</i>

522
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:39,114
Ellen, I called you about that
silly goodbye.

523
00:45:39,239 --> 00:45:40,407
Could you hold on for just one second?

524
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:42,201
Yeah, but I'm actually
on my way out to dinner.

525
00:45:42,284 --> 00:45:43,368
Just hold a second.

526
00:45:43,493 --> 00:45:44,828
- Can we...
- I'm just in the middle of...

527
00:45:44,953 --> 00:45:45,913
- See, I've gotta...
- Ellen.

528
00:45:46,038 --> 00:45:48,248
- Just call me later, okay?
- Don't go.

529
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:49,541
Okay.

530
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:52,961
Hello.

531
00:45:53,086 --> 00:45:55,214
- Hello, stranger.
- Claire, hold on.

532
00:45:55,297 --> 00:45:57,382
Here's what's great
about the Nashville airport.

533
00:45:57,466 --> 00:45:58,926
I just wanted to call you and thank you.

534
00:45:59,009 --> 00:46:00,260
So, you know, goodbye, thank you and...

535
00:46:00,344 --> 00:46:01,637
- I'll hold.
- Okay.

536
00:46:01,762 --> 00:46:02,721
<i>Hello?</i>

537
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:04,848
Cremated, don't you agree?

538
00:46:04,973 --> 00:46:07,100
Heather, they really love him here.

539
00:46:07,518 --> 00:46:11,063
They're not buying cremation.
They don't even acknowledge the word.

540
00:46:11,188 --> 00:46:12,606
But I need to call you right back.

541
00:46:12,981 --> 00:46:15,943
Is there anything more important
than the conversation we're having?

542
00:46:16,068 --> 00:46:18,070
I will call you right back.

543
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:20,614
No problem.
Just dial "hell" and I'll answer.

544
00:46:20,739 --> 00:46:23,617
I'll call you right back.

545
00:46:25,661 --> 00:46:26,954
I miss Dad.

546
00:46:30,207 --> 00:46:31,750
Was he a fun guy?

547
00:46:32,918 --> 00:46:34,628
Of course he was a fun guy.

548
00:46:34,753 --> 00:46:37,631
Especially in the last few years
when you got so busy.

549
00:46:40,467 --> 00:46:42,052
I'll call you right back.

550
00:46:45,889 --> 00:46:48,392
<i>- I know you're late for dinner.</i>
- I am late.

551
00:46:48,517 --> 00:46:50,435
- I'm in Kentucky.
- Drew.

552
00:46:52,187 --> 00:46:56,024
It was real and it was great,
and it was really great.

553
00:46:57,025 --> 00:47:00,404
<i>Call me anytime, okay? Goodbye.</i>

554
00:47:00,571 --> 00:47:05,200
<i>It's just goodbye, you know?</i>
<i>It's not "goodbye." It's just goodbye.</i>

555
00:47:05,826 --> 00:47:06,785
<i>Take care.</i>

556
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:09,413
Goodbye.

557
00:47:10,873 --> 00:47:11,874
Goodbye.

558
00:47:23,886 --> 00:47:24,720
Hello?

559
00:47:25,095 --> 00:47:27,806
Good Lord. Did I win the phone lottery?

560
00:47:28,348 --> 00:47:30,809
<i>Tell me about the Nashville airport.</i>

561
00:47:31,059 --> 00:47:34,188
I'm over it.
I'm actually almost home now.

562
00:47:34,354 --> 00:47:36,565
Were the roads as hellish as I told you?

563
00:47:37,274 --> 00:47:40,110
Claire, my dad's dead.

564
00:47:43,238 --> 00:47:44,406
I know.

565
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:47,367
You knew?

566
00:47:49,369 --> 00:47:51,038
I don't know a lot about everything...

567
00:47:51,121 --> 00:47:53,665
but I do know a lot about
the part of everything that I know...

568
00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:55,375
which is people.

569
00:47:55,918 --> 00:47:58,420
And I thought I was so mysterious.

570
00:47:58,837 --> 00:48:03,091
Trust me, everybody is less mysterious
than they think they are.

571
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:08,180
And they all know me,
and I don't know any of them...

572
00:48:08,263 --> 00:48:10,182
and I had never seen
a dead body before.

573
00:48:10,599 --> 00:48:13,769
To have never taken a solitary road trip
across country?

574
00:48:13,894 --> 00:48:18,315
I mean, everybody's gotta take
a road trip at least once in their lives.

575
00:48:18,607 --> 00:48:20,234
Just you and some music.

576
00:48:20,359 --> 00:48:24,947
You have no idea of the sheer volume
of my cousin's kid when he cries.

577
00:48:25,072 --> 00:48:27,658
I mean, I think there is definitely
a higher spirit.

578
00:48:27,783 --> 00:48:29,743
But I agree, what's left behind finally...

579
00:48:29,826 --> 00:48:31,703
are the impressions
you made on people.

580
00:48:34,081 --> 00:48:36,708
More important is to know where to go.

581
00:48:38,252 --> 00:48:40,546
You haven't traveled at all, have you?

582
00:48:40,671 --> 00:48:44,174
I just recently decided
that things really are black and white.

583
00:48:44,383 --> 00:48:46,802
And so, we all became helpers.

584
00:48:47,302 --> 00:48:50,848
Which I still can't help.
I can't help helping.

585
00:48:50,973 --> 00:48:53,767
Okay, I'll drive back home.
At least part of the way.

586
00:48:53,892 --> 00:48:55,769
I will take a road trip.

587
00:48:56,019 --> 00:48:57,980
<i>I was actually gonna go</i>
<i>with Mitch next year.</i>

588
00:48:58,105 --> 00:48:59,773
Why am I calling him Mitch?

589
00:49:00,065 --> 00:49:03,318
I spend so much time thinking
about all the answers to the problem...

590
00:49:03,443 --> 00:49:05,737
that I forget
what the problem actually was.

591
00:49:05,821 --> 00:49:08,615
If you're smart, you'll just wear your
shoes and never ask any questions.

592
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:09,867
Just enjoy your footwear.

593
00:49:09,992 --> 00:49:13,036
Do you ever just think,
"I'm fooling everybody"?

594
00:49:14,121 --> 00:49:15,539
You have no idea.

595
00:49:15,747 --> 00:49:17,958
Men see things in a box.

596
00:49:18,917 --> 00:49:21,253
And women see them in a round room.

597
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,423
Look at this. He was so young here.

598
00:49:29,261 --> 00:49:30,637
My mom.

599
00:49:31,471 --> 00:49:34,016
Not the one they wanted him to marry.

600
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:36,643
They met in an elevator.

601
00:49:37,352 --> 00:49:39,813
I think I've been asleep most of my life.

602
00:49:41,523 --> 00:49:42,774
Me, too.

603
00:50:07,007 --> 00:50:08,675
Good Lord!

604
00:50:24,107 --> 00:50:26,527
Do you want to have a beer
over the phone?

605
00:50:42,084 --> 00:50:43,544
Chuck and Cindy.

606
00:50:44,294 --> 00:50:46,421
<i>Cindy and Chuck.</i>

607
00:50:51,426 --> 00:50:53,679
I am currently stealing...

608
00:50:54,096 --> 00:50:58,141
Chuck and Cindy's wedding beer.

609
00:51:02,855 --> 00:51:04,857
You're a friend of Chuck's, right?

610
00:51:06,108 --> 00:51:08,944
- Yes.
- No, you're not. I'm Chuck.

611
00:51:10,404 --> 00:51:11,864
Of Chuck and Cindy?

612
00:51:12,281 --> 00:51:14,074
- Is that Chuck?
- It's Chuck.

613
00:51:14,741 --> 00:51:15,742
Who are you?

614
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:19,204
Drew Baylor. Your neighbor.

615
00:51:19,621 --> 00:51:21,707
- You're here for my wedding?
- No.

616
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:22,791
Business?

617
00:51:23,625 --> 00:51:26,253
My dad died. I'm here for his funeral.

618
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:30,215
I'm sorry. I can't...

619
00:51:31,884 --> 00:51:34,178
- That's hard.
- It is hard, yeah.

620
00:51:36,722 --> 00:51:38,599
- No, no, please.
- Shit!

621
00:51:39,224 --> 00:51:42,352
Please, no. No, no, Chuck. No, Chuck.

622
00:51:42,769 --> 00:51:44,229
Chuck, please.

623
00:51:53,530 --> 00:51:56,617
Death and life and death and life.

624
00:51:57,284 --> 00:51:59,244
Right next door to each other!

625
00:52:00,329 --> 00:52:02,247
There's a hair between them.

626
00:52:12,674 --> 00:52:16,845
We're here for the next three days.
If there's anything I can do for you...

627
00:52:21,183 --> 00:52:22,643
Chuck Hasboro.

628
00:52:23,519 --> 00:52:24,520
Hi, Claire.

629
00:52:24,728 --> 00:52:29,233
Look, if there's anything I can do
for you guys, okay? Anything.

630
00:52:29,566 --> 00:52:30,734
Thank you, Chuck.

631
00:52:31,485 --> 00:52:33,195
I love you, Claire.

632
00:52:40,327 --> 00:52:41,411
Okay.

633
00:52:42,621 --> 00:52:44,706
It's all about family, bro.

634
00:52:45,999 --> 00:52:47,209
Thank you, Chuck.

635
00:53:15,571 --> 00:53:17,698
<i>But they say it will hit you.</i>

636
00:53:17,823 --> 00:53:20,701
It could be 10 minutes
or it could be 10 years from now.

637
00:53:20,826 --> 00:53:24,162
So it's good that you talk about it,
or don't talk about it.

638
00:53:24,246 --> 00:53:28,667
Well, we have talked about it,
but that's what they say.

639
00:53:29,084 --> 00:53:30,335
That's what they say, huh?

640
00:53:30,419 --> 00:53:32,588
Yes, that's what they say.

641
00:53:33,338 --> 00:53:36,466
I've always wondered this.
Who are "they"?

642
00:53:36,967 --> 00:53:39,052
You know, "them."

643
00:53:39,428 --> 00:53:40,429
"Them."

644
00:53:41,054 --> 00:53:43,807
The inimitable collective "them."

645
00:53:44,266 --> 00:53:46,727
And who says we're supposed to listen
to them?

646
00:53:46,935 --> 00:53:48,187
They do!

647
00:53:51,607 --> 00:53:52,858
<i>Doesn't your ear hurt?</i>

648
00:53:53,775 --> 00:53:55,235
Yes, it does.

649
00:53:55,903 --> 00:53:58,697
<i>And I have to get up in two hours</i>
<i>and be charming.</i>

650
00:53:59,281 --> 00:54:00,741
I'm going to Hawaii.

651
00:54:01,992 --> 00:54:04,786
- You'll get there and have fun.
- I'll get there and sleep.

652
00:54:05,621 --> 00:54:09,166
It's just a little vacation
I traded routes for...

653
00:54:18,967 --> 00:54:20,552
I'll let you go.

654
00:54:21,053 --> 00:54:22,137
<i>Wait.</i>

655
00:54:25,307 --> 00:54:26,683
When will you be back?

656
00:54:29,978 --> 00:54:31,104
<i>Hello.</i>

657
00:54:36,318 --> 00:54:37,903
<i>You still there?</i>

658
00:54:39,571 --> 00:54:40,656
Yeah.

659
00:54:41,657 --> 00:54:45,452
I'm just wondering if this whole thing
is better on the phone.

660
00:54:46,203 --> 00:54:48,038
You're so much better on the phone.

661
00:54:48,705 --> 00:54:51,625
Maybe we should never
face each other again.

662
00:54:53,377 --> 00:54:54,920
I enjoyed this.

663
00:54:58,841 --> 00:55:01,844
<i>Hey, you're only 45 minutes away.</i>

664
00:55:04,346 --> 00:55:06,723
You want to meet halfway
and see the sunrise?

665
00:55:07,391 --> 00:55:10,435
<i>At this point,</i>
<i>it's probably easier to stay up.</i>

666
00:55:13,188 --> 00:55:14,273
You think so?

667
00:55:14,398 --> 00:55:16,692
I think that's what they say.

668
00:55:23,198 --> 00:55:24,950
<i>Hey, you still with me?</i>

669
00:55:25,325 --> 00:55:28,662
Yeah, I'm still here.

670
00:55:29,705 --> 00:55:32,165
- Take exit 43.
<i>- Okay.</i>

671
00:55:54,021 --> 00:55:55,355
I see your headlights.

672
00:56:00,611 --> 00:56:01,945
I see your red hat.

673
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:04,781
There you are.

674
00:56:34,603 --> 00:56:35,771
Hello.

675
00:56:36,605 --> 00:56:37,689
Hey.

676
00:56:50,869 --> 00:56:52,412
Should we hang up now?

677
00:56:58,001 --> 00:56:59,336
Follow me.

678
00:57:06,844 --> 00:57:08,011
We peaked on the phone.

679
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:10,222
- Yeah, I'm a little tired.
- Yeah, me too.

680
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:25,696
<i>Last looks.</i>

681
00:57:32,327 --> 00:57:34,079
Have fun in Hawaii.

682
00:57:36,206 --> 00:57:38,083
<i>There's one right now.</i>

683
00:57:38,292 --> 00:57:39,418
<i>Aloha.</i>

684
00:57:42,004 --> 00:57:43,088
<i>Aloha.</i>

685
00:58:01,148 --> 00:58:02,649
You will not defeat me.

686
00:58:10,782 --> 00:58:12,492
What are you doing?

687
00:58:15,495 --> 00:58:17,831
Mom, are you sure?

688
00:58:17,915 --> 00:58:21,668
Are you sure about the...
Are you sure about the cremation?

689
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:23,962
Honey, I don't know when
I'm going to crash...

690
00:58:24,046 --> 00:58:26,882
but as of right now,
we are learning about the car...

691
00:58:27,007 --> 00:58:30,886
and I'm learning organic cooking,
I'm gonna tap dance...

692
00:58:31,011 --> 00:58:33,764
and later on today,
I am going to fix the toilet.

693
00:58:33,847 --> 00:58:35,849
It is five minutes at a time.

694
00:58:35,933 --> 00:58:38,310
Do you all know about
out in California...

695
00:58:38,393 --> 00:58:40,062
how many people they cremate
out there?

696
00:58:40,187 --> 00:58:42,147
- No. How many?
- 80%, I read.

697
00:58:42,272 --> 00:58:43,857
- Get out!
- I'm not kidding you.

698
00:58:44,274 --> 00:58:46,568
Mom, I think you need to slow down.

699
00:58:46,693 --> 00:58:49,238
Look, everybody tells me
that I should take sedatives...

700
00:58:49,363 --> 00:58:51,448
but, hey, I am out here
and I'm making things happen.

701
00:58:51,532 --> 00:58:53,033
All forward motion counts.

702
00:58:53,116 --> 00:58:54,868
<i>Sweetheart,</i>
<i>when are you coming back?</i>

703
00:58:54,952 --> 00:58:56,662
There's a memorial this Saturday.

704
00:58:56,745 --> 00:58:59,831
Okay. And who's there helping you
plan all of this, sweetheart?

705
00:58:59,957 --> 00:59:02,376
Uncle Dale and Bill Banyon.

706
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:06,880
Bill Banyon is there?

707
00:59:07,548 --> 00:59:09,007
- Bill Banyon?
- Yeah.

708
00:59:09,091 --> 00:59:10,300
He is a con man.

709
00:59:10,384 --> 00:59:12,511
He swindled your father
out of thousands of dollars.

710
00:59:12,594 --> 00:59:14,263
<i>Seventeen years ago,</i>
<i>he did something...</i>

711
00:59:14,388 --> 00:59:17,182
which almost ruined this family
to its very core.

712
00:59:17,266 --> 00:59:18,225
Mother...

713
00:59:18,350 --> 00:59:20,644
Wrapping himself in the nobility
of your father's memory.

714
00:59:21,061 --> 00:59:23,188
- Boy, he's getting an earful.
- Boy, I'll tell you.

715
00:59:23,397 --> 00:59:25,816
Mother! Listen! Focus!

716
00:59:25,941 --> 00:59:27,109
Beware.

717
00:59:27,234 --> 00:59:30,070
I know it's all very charming
with the pickled things in jars...

718
00:59:30,195 --> 00:59:32,823
and the Southern charm
and the hams that hang in the garage...

719
00:59:32,906 --> 00:59:35,742
until they're so covered with mold
you could grow penicillin on them...

720
00:59:35,868 --> 00:59:37,578
Are you sure about the cremation?

721
00:59:37,911 --> 00:59:41,039
If Bill Banyon is there,
definitely cremation!

722
00:59:41,164 --> 00:59:44,209
<i>And you tell Bill Banyon, I'll be there.</i>

723
00:59:49,214 --> 00:59:50,215
Hello.

724
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:51,508
Aloha.

725
00:59:52,259 --> 00:59:54,011
I talked to my friend, Kendra...

726
00:59:54,094 --> 00:59:58,015
who had a girlfriend with a kid
who is exceedingly loud like Samson...

727
00:59:58,098 --> 01:00:02,561
and she's given me a videotape
that works absolute miracles.

728
01:00:03,270 --> 01:00:04,771
Hey, thanks, Claire.

729
01:00:05,439 --> 01:00:07,816
What, you're already tired of me?

730
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,527
I just haven't slept. I'm sorry.

731
01:00:11,612 --> 01:00:13,030
How's Hawaii?

732
01:00:14,656 --> 01:00:18,368
Well, I'm checking out this cute guy.

733
01:00:19,661 --> 01:00:20,996
Why are you telling me that?

734
01:00:28,795 --> 01:00:31,131
How could I leave you in distress?

735
01:00:32,508 --> 01:00:34,259
I'm taking you out.

736
01:00:37,638 --> 01:00:39,806
- I thought you were in Hawaii.
- What's this?

737
01:00:39,932 --> 01:00:42,434
"When cremation is your preference."

738
01:00:42,893 --> 01:00:45,229
I just got some brochures
I want you all to look at.

739
01:00:45,312 --> 01:00:47,773
And these are some choice of urns...

740
01:00:47,856 --> 01:00:49,858
available here
at the Cave Hill Cemetery.

741
01:00:49,983 --> 01:00:51,944
You can take them home and...

742
01:00:54,988 --> 01:00:57,199
You can look at those brochures and...

743
01:00:58,659 --> 01:01:01,495
Y'all can look at those,
take those home with you.

744
01:01:01,745 --> 01:01:03,372
Whatever makes you happy.

745
01:01:14,508 --> 01:01:16,969
<i>We are shopping for an urn.</i>

746
01:01:33,485 --> 01:01:36,780
And you can pick this up tomorrow
immediately following the procedure.

747
01:01:53,297 --> 01:01:55,007
<i>The Jim Morrison of Kentucky.</i>

748
01:02:40,135 --> 01:02:43,222
You're kind of great, Claire.
You do know that.

749
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:46,725
- Sort of amazing, even.
- Oh, come on!

750
01:02:47,267 --> 01:02:50,896
- I don't need an ice cream cone.
- It's not an ice cream cone.

751
01:02:52,189 --> 01:02:53,732
What's an ice cream cone?

752
01:02:54,107 --> 01:02:55,400
You know.

753
01:02:55,692 --> 01:02:57,861
"Here's a little something
to make you happy.

754
01:02:57,945 --> 01:03:00,906
"Something sweet that melts
in five minutes."

755
01:03:01,698 --> 01:03:05,494
I'm completely cool with anything
you want to say or not say.

756
01:03:06,036 --> 01:03:07,454
I don't need it.

757
01:03:08,288 --> 01:03:10,624
Besides, Ben is coming in tomorrow.

758
01:03:13,794 --> 01:03:16,630
- Do you want to hear my theory?
- Of course.

759
01:03:18,006 --> 01:03:21,552
You and I have a special talent,
and I saw it immediately.

760
01:03:22,469 --> 01:03:23,679
Tell me.

761
01:03:24,304 --> 01:03:26,390
We're the substitute people.

762
01:03:26,974 --> 01:03:28,433
The substitute people.

763
01:03:28,976 --> 01:03:31,311
I've been the substitute person
my whole life.

764
01:03:32,104 --> 01:03:35,190
I'm not an Ellen.
I never wanted to be an Ellen.

765
01:03:35,983 --> 01:03:39,319
And I'm not a Cindy, either.
Although Chucks love me.

766
01:03:40,487 --> 01:03:42,114
I'm sure they do.

767
01:03:43,031 --> 01:03:44,908
I like being alone too much.

768
01:03:45,284 --> 01:03:48,662
I mean, I'm with a guy who's married
to his academic career.

769
01:03:48,954 --> 01:03:51,915
I rarely see him.
And I'm the substitute person there.

770
01:03:52,499 --> 01:03:55,335
I like it that way. It's a lot less pressure.

771
01:03:58,130 --> 01:03:59,214
Here.

772
01:04:00,507 --> 01:04:02,509
Play this for the loudest kid in the world.

773
01:04:05,179 --> 01:04:07,431
I'm not used to girls like you.

774
01:04:08,056 --> 01:04:09,933
That's because I'm one of a kind.

775
01:04:10,309 --> 01:04:11,810
You don't have to make a joke.

776
01:04:13,353 --> 01:04:14,730
I like you without the jokes.

777
01:04:19,776 --> 01:04:21,320
Get some sleep.

778
01:04:22,029 --> 01:04:24,907
I have a personnel interview
tomorrow morning...

779
01:04:25,032 --> 01:04:28,869
and if I get transferred, Ben will die.

780
01:05:00,901 --> 01:05:02,694
Didn't it just feel better...

781
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:06,114
that we just didn't
do something impulsive?

782
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:07,824
- I mean...
- Yes.

783
01:05:09,910 --> 01:05:12,204
Now we actually have a shot
at being friends...

784
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:14,748
for the rest of our lives.

785
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:20,379
The rest of our lives.

786
01:05:28,512 --> 01:05:31,640
Okay, now for the celebration proper
we got the military bands...

787
01:05:31,723 --> 01:05:34,601
the right mix of seven speakers,
no crybabies...

788
01:05:34,685 --> 01:05:37,396
It's official. Paul, Doug and Rick
are flying in from Florida.

789
01:05:37,521 --> 01:05:40,399
Ruckus will reunite for this one evening.

790
01:05:44,987 --> 01:05:46,071
How we doing on balloons?

791
01:05:46,196 --> 01:05:47,990
I sent to Balloon City,
I got a bunch of them.

792
01:05:48,115 --> 01:05:50,617
And, Drew, my casket did come in
from Lexington...

793
01:05:50,742 --> 01:05:53,370
and I got to tell you, it's quite beautiful.

794
01:05:53,871 --> 01:05:56,748
Look, Drew, I am getting the question
constantly, okay?

795
01:05:56,874 --> 01:05:59,877
Why isn't he buried in Elizabethtown?

796
01:06:02,254 --> 01:06:04,381
It's not an insult to anybody here.

797
01:06:05,382 --> 01:06:07,384
Well, is there such a thing
as partial cremation?

798
01:06:08,385 --> 01:06:11,263
Bill Banyon, how can you even say
such a thing?

799
01:06:14,766 --> 01:06:16,560
I know you all love my dad.

800
01:06:17,519 --> 01:06:19,813
You can't dismiss my mother's wishes.

801
01:06:20,564 --> 01:06:22,065
And we're not from California.

802
01:06:22,316 --> 01:06:24,902
Jessie, can you do something
about your son?

803
01:06:25,777 --> 01:06:27,154
Yeah. All right.

804
01:06:27,362 --> 01:06:29,573
A couple of good ass-kickings
might be in line.

805
01:06:29,823 --> 01:06:31,742
I think what Charles Dean
wants to say...

806
01:06:31,867 --> 01:06:33,035
I know what he's saying.

807
01:06:41,210 --> 01:06:44,379
You all have different versions of him
that you love a lot.

808
01:06:46,465 --> 01:06:47,925
This is ours.

809
01:06:50,052 --> 01:06:53,430
My family's record of the last thing
he said on the subject.

810
01:06:54,431 --> 01:06:56,016
That's the plan.

811
01:06:56,433 --> 01:06:58,393
That is the way it's going to be, guys.

812
01:06:58,685 --> 01:07:00,187
Sprinkled at sea!

813
01:07:00,729 --> 01:07:01,772
Samson...

814
01:07:03,357 --> 01:07:05,984
And that's the decision from California.

815
01:07:09,571 --> 01:07:11,698
Shit. Oregon.

816
01:07:15,577 --> 01:07:17,371
We really are from Oregon.

817
01:07:18,664 --> 01:07:21,416
Don't make me come spank you.
Leave him alone!

818
01:07:28,966 --> 01:07:30,968
Jessie, I have something for you.

819
01:07:35,639 --> 01:07:38,809
Samson, we're gonna watch this.

820
01:07:42,104 --> 01:07:43,272
One second.

821
01:07:52,865 --> 01:07:55,409
<i>Hi. My name's Rusty.</i>

822
01:07:58,078 --> 01:08:00,122
<i>I helped build this house</i>
<i>a long time ago.</i>

823
01:08:00,622 --> 01:08:02,708
<i>But wood-eating insects</i>
<i>called termites...</i>

824
01:08:02,833 --> 01:08:05,711
<i>have compromised the integrity</i>
<i>of this once fine structure.</i>

825
01:08:05,836 --> 01:08:07,129
What's that sound?

826
01:08:07,462 --> 01:08:10,757
<i>So today, I'm gonna blow it up.</i>

827
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:14,970
Silence.

828
01:08:15,846 --> 01:08:17,055
<i>Now...</i>

829
01:08:18,098 --> 01:08:20,475
<i>if I blow this house up...</i>

830
01:08:21,435 --> 01:08:25,397
<i>will you promise to behave</i>
<i>and mind your mommy and daddy?</i>

831
01:08:25,856 --> 01:08:27,316
Yes!

832
01:08:40,037 --> 01:08:41,205
<i>Good.</i>

833
01:08:42,372 --> 01:08:43,707
<i>Let's blow it up.</i>

834
01:08:51,131 --> 01:08:53,634
<i>- Joe, we ready to go?</i>
<i>- Yeah, Rusty, light it up.</i>

835
01:08:58,013 --> 01:08:59,431
<i>Fire in the hole!</i>

836
01:09:00,182 --> 01:09:01,183
<i>Three...</i>

837
01:09:02,726 --> 01:09:03,769
<i>two...</i>

838
01:09:05,270 --> 01:09:06,313
<i>one.</i>

839
01:09:28,085 --> 01:09:30,170
<i>Now, let's build a new house.</i>

840
01:09:40,430 --> 01:09:44,351
Thank you
for taking an interest in Jessie.

841
01:09:56,822 --> 01:09:58,240
Feels good, doesn't it?

842
01:09:59,491 --> 01:10:01,326
It's like Mitch is here.

843
01:10:03,745 --> 01:10:06,582
I can see Mitch right now, so proud...

844
01:10:07,749 --> 01:10:09,084
in that blue suit.

845
01:10:11,587 --> 01:10:12,754
Can't you?

846
01:10:38,989 --> 01:10:41,033
Stop the cremation!

847
01:10:43,660 --> 01:10:46,246
Stop the cremation!

848
01:10:47,372 --> 01:10:50,125
- Stop the cremation!
- What the hell's going on, man?

849
01:10:50,501 --> 01:10:52,461
Hold on. Wait right here.

850
01:11:08,018 --> 01:11:09,311
I'm sorry.

851
01:11:19,196 --> 01:11:20,656
Here's your dad, man.

852
01:12:10,873 --> 01:12:11,832
I agree with her.

853
01:12:11,915 --> 01:12:14,459
It takes a year and a half
to plan a wedding properly.

854
01:12:14,668 --> 01:12:15,627
It does...

855
01:12:16,712 --> 01:12:18,630
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

856
01:12:19,089 --> 01:12:22,384
This is Claire.
I feel like I've known her my whole life.

857
01:12:22,593 --> 01:12:25,637
He was at my door last night yelling,
"Cindy, you get out here."

858
01:12:25,762 --> 01:12:29,391
And I was like, "Chuck, not tonight!
Not until we get married..."

859
01:12:33,896 --> 01:12:35,230
Is that...

860
01:12:36,857 --> 01:12:38,233
Hey, Mitch.

861
01:12:42,362 --> 01:12:43,864
So, what happened to Ben?

862
01:12:48,493 --> 01:12:52,581
There was a storm in Georgia.
They grounded all the planes.

863
01:12:52,789 --> 01:12:54,374
And he doesn't like to fly.

864
01:12:54,625 --> 01:12:57,503
And now they want him to speak
at some trustees event...

865
01:12:57,628 --> 01:12:59,421
and trot out some big ideas.

866
01:12:59,671 --> 01:13:01,840
Claire, I want to see you...

867
01:13:01,924 --> 01:13:04,760
on the tour of Maker's Mark tomorrow
at 10:00 a.m. Sharp.

868
01:13:04,885 --> 01:13:06,094
- All right?
- All right.

869
01:13:06,178 --> 01:13:08,388
I love this girl!

870
01:13:17,481 --> 01:13:18,774
You look great.

871
01:13:19,191 --> 01:13:20,442
I'm a mess.

872
01:13:20,901 --> 01:13:23,695
- You're crazy, Claire. You look amazing.
- Thank you.

873
01:13:23,820 --> 01:13:24,947
And this dress...

874
01:13:25,739 --> 01:13:28,033
Did well on the personnel interview,
though.

875
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:32,371
Right. The interview. I forgot.

876
01:13:32,746 --> 01:13:36,416
I know. I'm impossible to forget,
but I'm hard to remember.

877
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:45,592
Drew! Lovin' life, lovin' you.

878
01:13:46,844 --> 01:13:49,054
Hey, missed you
at the rehearsal dinner.

879
01:13:55,352 --> 01:13:56,895
- Claire?
- Yeah?

880
01:13:56,979 --> 01:13:59,481
Let's show Mitch the site
of his memorial.

881
01:14:14,538 --> 01:14:16,748
"Chuck and Cindy, the wedding!"

882
01:14:21,378 --> 01:14:22,671
Here you go, Dad.

883
01:14:28,302 --> 01:14:31,972
<i>Welcome to the annual meeting</i>
<i>of people who...</i>

884
01:14:32,556 --> 01:14:34,016
<i>annually meet!</i>

885
01:14:35,017 --> 01:14:38,604
<i>- And we'll see you all again next year.</i>
- Very nice. Come on.

886
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:43,483
I'm just going to say right now
what we're not saying...

887
01:14:43,567 --> 01:14:46,278
and let the chips fall, let the chips fall...

888
01:14:46,403 --> 01:14:49,031
let the chips fall where they may.

889
01:14:49,948 --> 01:14:54,453
Yes, I may be embarrassing myself,
but I'm just going to say it.

890
01:14:58,707 --> 01:15:00,792
<i>I like you!</i>

891
01:15:06,965 --> 01:15:07,966
<i>What?</i>

892
01:15:08,217 --> 01:15:09,927
I think you should eat something.

893
01:15:11,678 --> 01:15:14,932
I've been starving myself all week long!

894
01:15:15,724 --> 01:15:17,392
- For Ben.
- Man, I'm gonna eat.

895
01:15:17,726 --> 01:15:19,561
- We'll eat in my room.
- Room service?

896
01:15:20,187 --> 01:15:23,690
I want cheese
and cheese-related things.

897
01:15:23,774 --> 01:15:26,985
No, eggs and fries.
With cheese on everything.

898
01:15:27,194 --> 01:15:29,780
- Cheese it is.
- Cheese and Coca-Cola.

899
01:15:31,114 --> 01:15:32,282
And don't worry.

900
01:15:32,407 --> 01:15:36,078
Because as great as you look tonight,
you are safe with me.

901
01:15:36,703 --> 01:15:39,998
Of course, it's safe. It's a full moon.

902
01:15:41,959 --> 01:15:44,586
- I look good.
- You do look good.

903
01:15:44,670 --> 01:15:46,129
I'm wearing these clothes. I mean...

904
01:15:46,255 --> 01:15:47,923
Have you ever had unlucky clothes?

905
01:15:48,507 --> 01:15:49,716
This dress that you like?

906
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:52,261
Good things have not happened to me
in this dress.

907
01:15:52,386 --> 01:15:54,638
But I saw it tonight and I said:

908
01:15:55,013 --> 01:15:56,932
"I'm gonna give you one more chance."

909
01:15:57,099 --> 01:16:00,143
And I refuse to be let down
by this dress again.

910
01:16:02,938 --> 01:16:04,481
Anyway, forget all that.

911
01:16:05,691 --> 01:16:10,153
You're here, and we're together,
and it's a get-out-of-jail-free card.

912
01:16:10,529 --> 01:16:12,030
It's almost midnight.

913
01:16:12,114 --> 01:16:15,951
Life cannot be so cruel
that we don't deserve to be together...

914
01:16:16,493 --> 01:16:17,661
to eat.

915
01:16:21,081 --> 01:16:23,750
- Hi, Chuck.
- Hey, Cindy.

916
01:16:29,506 --> 01:16:31,800
Wait. Where's Mitch?

917
01:16:33,010 --> 01:16:34,928
I left him in the ballroom.

918
01:16:52,321 --> 01:16:54,573
I'm sorry Ben missed the flight.

919
01:16:57,618 --> 01:16:58,911
He forgot?

920
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:03,916
No storm in Georgia. No trustees.

921
01:17:05,167 --> 01:17:07,002
No big ideas.

922
01:17:09,254 --> 01:17:11,507
- What a fucking jerk.
- He's not a jerk.

923
01:17:11,632 --> 01:17:15,385
He's a brilliant man who gives himself
permission to be preoccupied.

924
01:17:17,012 --> 01:17:18,138
Come on.

925
01:17:19,223 --> 01:17:22,309
You know, there is nothing greater
than deciding in your life...

926
01:17:22,392 --> 01:17:25,312
that things maybe really are
black and white!

927
01:17:25,646 --> 01:17:28,524
And this guy, Ben,
who clearly takes you for granted...

928
01:17:28,649 --> 01:17:31,443
who serially takes advantage of you,
is bad!

929
01:17:31,527 --> 01:17:34,863
And what I am saying is good.
See what I mean?

930
01:17:36,573 --> 01:17:38,742
You shouldn't be the substitute
for anybody.

931
01:17:40,369 --> 01:17:44,831
This guy should be right here,
right now, doing this.

932
01:17:56,844 --> 01:17:58,053
Maybe so.

933
01:18:02,391 --> 01:18:05,060
He's lucky I'm not
the right person for you.

934
01:18:09,648 --> 01:18:13,151
I know why it's not you, but just tell me...

935
01:18:15,362 --> 01:18:17,364
so I can see it from your perspective.

936
01:18:19,741 --> 01:18:21,785
See, I know what you deserve.

937
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:26,957
What do I deserve?

938
01:18:29,376 --> 01:18:30,836
You deserve...

939
01:18:34,631 --> 01:18:36,091
You deserve...

940
01:18:40,929 --> 01:18:42,848
You deserve...

941
01:18:49,980 --> 01:18:51,565
a guy who says:

942
01:18:54,735 --> 01:18:57,112
"I can't imagine a world without you.

943
01:18:59,615 --> 01:19:02,117
"We will start a winery when we are 70.

944
01:19:04,244 --> 01:19:08,498
"We will snowboard every December,
and one year take our kids.

945
01:19:10,667 --> 01:19:13,045
"And we will always have
the twin red Lexuses...

946
01:19:13,462 --> 01:19:16,423
"with the license plates reading:
'Chuck and Cindy."'

947
01:19:19,301 --> 01:19:22,596
You deserve all this and more.

948
01:19:24,598 --> 01:19:26,350
It's not you, I know.

949
01:19:41,031 --> 01:19:44,743
- Please don't take this as rejection.
- I really don't.

950
01:19:53,752 --> 01:19:57,464
<i>Ben's very lucky. All we did was kiss.</i>

951
01:19:58,841 --> 01:20:03,220
<i>Most of the sex I've had in my life</i>
<i>was not as personal as that kiss.</i>

952
01:20:26,285 --> 01:20:28,662
I'm putting on my shoes now.

953
01:20:35,377 --> 01:20:37,713
Excuse me. Sorry.

954
01:20:56,565 --> 01:20:58,901
I'm walking out the door...

955
01:20:59,860 --> 01:21:01,695
in last night's clothes.

956
01:21:05,991 --> 01:21:08,785
"Hey, Claire. Don't leave.

957
01:21:08,911 --> 01:21:11,496
"Stay. Let's have breakfast."

958
01:21:22,883 --> 01:21:26,261
I will miss your lips
and everything attached to them.

959
01:21:31,183 --> 01:21:32,643
See you, Mitch.

960
01:22:00,462 --> 01:22:02,172
Claire, you slut!

961
01:22:02,381 --> 01:22:05,092
- Claire! Swear to God!
- Claire!

962
01:22:25,487 --> 01:22:26,697
Wait up!

963
01:22:28,365 --> 01:22:31,535
Just tell me you love me
and get it over with.

964
01:22:32,369 --> 01:22:35,956
Claire, I'm just going to say this
because you deserve it.

965
01:22:36,039 --> 01:22:39,126
It's not easy for me, but here goes.

966
01:22:42,337 --> 01:22:43,755
Four days ago...

967
01:22:44,089 --> 01:22:47,676
I lost a major
American shoe company...

968
01:22:50,053 --> 01:22:54,558
Frankly, you could round it off
to one billion dollars!

969
01:22:55,267 --> 01:22:58,520
And by tomorrow afternoon,
everyone will know.

970
01:22:59,146 --> 01:23:02,900
Something's gonna be published
that pinpoints me as the most...

971
01:23:03,609 --> 01:23:07,362
spectacular failure in the history
of my profession...

972
01:23:07,446 --> 01:23:08,906
which is all I know how to do.

973
01:23:09,031 --> 01:23:13,327
And I've been here this whole time
trying to be responsible and charming...

974
01:23:13,410 --> 01:23:15,621
and live up to this success...

975
01:23:16,496 --> 01:23:18,207
that doesn't exist.

976
01:23:18,874 --> 01:23:20,626
All I really want...

977
01:23:22,586 --> 01:23:25,839
is to not be here.

978
01:23:28,759 --> 01:23:30,052
I'm sorry.

979
01:23:30,802 --> 01:23:35,599
I have a very dark appointment
with destiny.

980
01:23:36,433 --> 01:23:38,018
That's my secret.

981
01:23:39,228 --> 01:23:40,812
That's who I am.

982
01:23:42,564 --> 01:23:43,899
That's it?

983
01:23:44,233 --> 01:23:45,817
Yes, that's it.

984
01:23:47,069 --> 01:23:49,655
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

985
01:23:50,822 --> 01:23:55,661
I guess I just thought a small part of you
might be a small bit sad to see me go.

986
01:23:55,994 --> 01:23:58,872
But I guess this is all mostly
about a shoe.

987
01:23:59,248 --> 01:24:01,083
Of course, I'm sad about you.

988
01:24:01,250 --> 01:24:03,585
But this is just a little bit bigger
than you and me!

989
01:24:03,669 --> 01:24:07,589
And by the way, I didn't say million.
I said billion!

990
01:24:09,758 --> 01:24:11,385
A billion dollars!

991
01:24:13,387 --> 01:24:14,930
That's a lot of million!

992
01:24:17,891 --> 01:24:19,351
So, you failed.

993
01:24:21,061 --> 01:24:25,399
- No, you don't get it.
- All right, you really failed.

994
01:24:26,108 --> 01:24:30,946
You failed, you failed, you failed.

995
01:24:33,031 --> 01:24:35,450
You failed, you failed, you...

996
01:24:38,412 --> 01:24:40,330
You think I care about that?

997
01:24:42,416 --> 01:24:43,959
I do understand.

998
01:24:46,295 --> 01:24:49,256
You're an artist, man.
Your job is to break through barriers.

999
01:24:49,381 --> 01:24:51,592
Not accept blame and bow and say:

1000
01:24:51,675 --> 01:24:53,844
"Thank you, I'm a loser,
I'll go away now."

1001
01:24:53,969 --> 01:24:56,597
"Phil's mean to me..." So what?

1002
01:24:56,680 --> 01:24:57,764
I don't cry.

1003
01:24:57,890 --> 01:24:59,641
You want to be really great?

1004
01:25:00,392 --> 01:25:04,479
Then have the courage to fail big
and stick around.

1005
01:25:04,605 --> 01:25:06,982
Make them wonder
why you're still smiling.

1006
01:25:10,194 --> 01:25:12,321
That's true greatness to me.

1007
01:25:14,031 --> 01:25:14,990
But...

1008
01:25:16,408 --> 01:25:18,785
don't listen to me, I'm a Claire.

1009
01:25:20,829 --> 01:25:23,415
- Well, thank you, Claire.
- You're welcome.

1010
01:25:23,540 --> 01:25:26,585
Now would you quit
trying to break up with me?

1011
01:25:26,668 --> 01:25:29,087
You're always trying
to break up with me...

1012
01:25:29,171 --> 01:25:31,298
and we're not even together.

1013
01:25:32,341 --> 01:25:33,550
I know.

1014
01:25:35,260 --> 01:25:36,303
Wait.

1015
01:25:37,930 --> 01:25:38,972
We're not?

1016
01:25:43,018 --> 01:25:44,520
Of course not.

1017
01:25:45,020 --> 01:25:47,648
We're the substitute people, remember?

1018
01:25:54,613 --> 01:25:57,574
I'll see you at Mitch's memorial,
if I can make it.

1019
01:26:37,364 --> 01:26:41,243
All right, when I give you the signal
pull the pulley slowly across.

1020
01:26:41,326 --> 01:26:43,537
All right, slow and soulful.

1021
01:26:43,787 --> 01:26:45,831
Will do. Slow and soulful.

1022
01:26:50,210 --> 01:26:52,504
- She came!
- That is her.

1023
01:26:52,588 --> 01:26:54,715
That is her. That's Hollie.

1024
01:26:54,798 --> 01:26:56,091
Hollie!

1025
01:26:56,550 --> 01:26:59,303
- Hollie.
- It's really good to see you.

1026
01:26:59,469 --> 01:27:02,556
- You look more beautiful than ever.
- Thank you.

1027
01:27:31,793 --> 01:27:35,506
<i>Mitch wrote letters.</i>
<i>Never once sent an e-mail.</i>

1028
01:27:37,257 --> 01:27:39,343
<i>He was always there for me.</i>

1029
01:27:39,468 --> 01:27:41,303
<i>Where are you, Mitch?</i>

1030
01:27:41,512 --> 01:27:43,096
<i>And I loved him.</i>

1031
01:27:44,681 --> 01:27:46,099
<i>And y'all know that.</i>

1032
01:27:47,976 --> 01:27:49,603
<i>I loved him!</i>

1033
01:27:49,937 --> 01:27:52,523
<i>Even though he moved to California...</i>

1034
01:27:53,690 --> 01:27:57,653
<i>God love him,</i>
<i>he always came back to his roots.</i>

1035
01:27:57,903 --> 01:28:00,572
<i>And I will miss his laugh.</i>

1036
01:28:00,906 --> 01:28:03,408
<i>I don't have anything funny to say.</i>

1037
01:28:04,326 --> 01:28:07,037
<i>And I don't have a funny story to tell.</i>

1038
01:28:07,788 --> 01:28:11,834
<i>I will tell you, it wasn't easy for Mitch</i>
<i>to leave the military...</i>

1039
01:28:12,417 --> 01:28:14,920
<i>and start over again in California.</i>

1040
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:33,021
<i>And I apologize, per se,</i>
<i>for my role in that deal, per se.</i>

1041
01:28:33,689 --> 01:28:36,066
<i>And to all of you</i>
<i>who put this evening together...</i>

1042
01:28:36,191 --> 01:28:38,861
<i>it has gone beautifully, and thank you.</i>

1043
01:28:39,486 --> 01:28:42,906
- Lena, it hasn't hit him yet.
- It will. It will.

1044
01:28:43,198 --> 01:28:45,075
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

1045
01:28:45,742 --> 01:28:47,160
<i>Hollie Baylor.</i>

1046
01:28:52,165 --> 01:28:54,334
I want you to stay awake for this,
all right?

1047
01:29:13,270 --> 01:29:15,063
<i>I'm a little nervous.</i>

1048
01:29:16,023 --> 01:29:17,608
<i>But here we are.</i>

1049
01:29:18,817 --> 01:29:20,319
<i>It's been a while.</i>

1050
01:29:25,574 --> 01:29:28,911
<i>There was this shorthand</i>
<i>of a long marriage.</i>

1051
01:29:30,287 --> 01:29:33,540
<i>We were complete opposites,</i>
<i>and it worked.</i>

1052
01:29:37,044 --> 01:29:38,921
<i>The plan was to send...</i>

1053
01:29:40,631 --> 01:29:42,925
<i>my son to represent the family.</i>

1054
01:29:44,468 --> 01:29:46,720
<i>I was terrified</i>
<i>that you would look at me and see...</i>

1055
01:29:46,803 --> 01:29:50,766
<i>that woman from California</i>
<i>who took him away.</i>

1056
01:29:51,642 --> 01:29:54,937
<i>Even though we only lived in California</i>
<i>as a family...</i>

1057
01:29:55,062 --> 01:29:57,272
<i>for 18 months, 27 years ago...</i>

1058
01:29:59,233 --> 01:30:02,361
<i>I always... felt it.</i>

1059
01:30:04,154 --> 01:30:08,617
<i>All because I was standing</i>
<i>in an elevator in Tokyo...</i>

1060
01:30:08,742 --> 01:30:12,246
<i>and this handsome captain walked in...</i>

1061
01:30:12,913 --> 01:30:15,290
<i>on his way home to Elizabethtown.</i>

1062
01:30:15,958 --> 01:30:19,920
<i>And he was engaged. And so was I.</i>

1063
01:30:22,840 --> 01:30:26,301
<i>And somehow I hijacked him</i>
<i>and took him to Disneyland!</i>

1064
01:30:33,267 --> 01:30:35,769
<i>But something happened between us...</i>

1065
01:30:37,145 --> 01:30:39,314
<i>that was not part of the plan.</i>

1066
01:30:42,234 --> 01:30:44,152
<i>We were in love.</i>

1067
01:30:51,076 --> 01:30:54,663
<i>Let me tell you a little bit about life</i>
<i>without Mitch.</i>

1068
01:30:56,248 --> 01:30:59,877
<i>I wanted to get to know</i>
<i>about Mitch's car...</i>

1069
01:31:00,002 --> 01:31:01,962
<i>and it actually ate me.</i>

1070
01:31:02,754 --> 01:31:05,757
<i>I went to the bank</i>
<i>and the teller looked at me strangely...</i>

1071
01:31:05,841 --> 01:31:08,051
<i>and I got home</i>
<i>and I looked at myself in the mirror...</i>

1072
01:31:08,177 --> 01:31:10,137
<i>and my face was still green</i>
<i>from a facial mask...</i>

1073
01:31:10,220 --> 01:31:12,514
<i>that I had forgotten to take off.</i>

1074
01:31:12,639 --> 01:31:15,601
<i>And I called our insurance man</i>
<i>of 30 years...</i>

1075
01:31:15,684 --> 01:31:19,730
<i>whose son Mitch had actually helped</i>
<i>to get into West Point...</i>

1076
01:31:19,855 --> 01:31:23,025
<i>to tell him that Mitch was gone.</i>

1077
01:31:23,734 --> 01:31:26,528
<i>He didn't call me back for two days.</i>

1078
01:31:28,739 --> 01:31:32,910
<i>The car, the bank, the insurance man,</i>
<i>the world.</i>

1079
01:31:33,035 --> 01:31:35,287
<i>I mean, nobody truly cared.</i>

1080
01:31:39,249 --> 01:31:40,667
<i>Not like us.</i>

1081
01:31:43,879 --> 01:31:46,089
<i>I always wanted to learn to tap dance...</i>

1082
01:31:46,215 --> 01:31:48,008
<i>so I took tap dance lessons.</i>

1083
01:31:48,133 --> 01:31:49,885
<i>And I wanted to learn... Yeah, I did.</i>

1084
01:31:50,010 --> 01:31:52,054
<i>And I wanted to learn</i>
<i>to cook organically...</i>

1085
01:31:52,179 --> 01:31:53,847
<i>and so I attempted that.</i>

1086
01:31:55,557 --> 01:31:58,185
<i>And I fixed the toilet.</i>

1087
01:32:00,812 --> 01:32:02,606
<i>Yeah. All by myself.</i>

1088
01:32:04,274 --> 01:32:07,402
<i>And I wanted to learn to laugh.</i>

1089
01:32:10,072 --> 01:32:13,158
<i>Why couldn't I be funnier</i>
<i>when Mitch was alive?</i>

1090
01:32:13,408 --> 01:32:16,954
<i>But you know, I figured it out.</i>
<i>It takes time to be funny...</i>

1091
01:32:17,079 --> 01:32:21,500
<i>and it takes time to extract joy from life.</i>

1092
01:32:23,460 --> 01:32:25,337
<i>So I enrolled in comedy school.</i>

1093
01:32:28,549 --> 01:32:30,926
<i>Yeah, I did. I know, I know.</i>

1094
01:32:31,051 --> 01:32:33,971
<i>I was the oldest one in the class.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

1095
01:32:35,055 --> 01:32:38,517
<i>And we were told to tell a story.</i>

1096
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:40,978
<i>Something true,</i>
<i>something that really happened to us.</i>

1097
01:32:41,103 --> 01:32:45,816
<i>So I got up there</i>
<i>and I talked about my husband...</i>

1098
01:32:47,192 --> 01:32:49,319
<i>and the love he left behind.</i>

1099
01:32:54,324 --> 01:32:56,410
<i>A few days after Mitch died...</i>

1100
01:32:56,493 --> 01:33:00,122
<i>I was walking through the yard</i>
<i>and I saw our neighbor...</i>

1101
01:33:00,455 --> 01:33:03,542
<i>who was a very good friend</i>
<i>of Mitch's, Bob...</i>

1102
01:33:04,126 --> 01:33:06,253
<i>and he saw me coming</i>
<i>through the gate...</i>

1103
01:33:07,838 --> 01:33:12,134
<i>and he said,</i>
<i>"I am so sorry for your loss."</i>

1104
01:33:12,676 --> 01:33:15,762
<i>And I knew that he needed</i>
<i>to feel that loss, too...</i>

1105
01:33:15,846 --> 01:33:17,931
<i>and to share it,</i>
<i>and I wanted to help him.</i>

1106
01:33:19,641 --> 01:33:22,728
<i>And he put his arms around me,</i>
<i>he cradled me...</i>

1107
01:33:22,811 --> 01:33:25,522
<i>and his embrace tightened.</i>

1108
01:33:26,398 --> 01:33:30,652
<i>Finally, here was somebody</i>
<i>who truly cared.</i>

1109
01:33:32,905 --> 01:33:35,073
<i>And then...</i>

1110
01:33:36,617 --> 01:33:39,453
<i>I felt something else.</i>

1111
01:33:51,715 --> 01:33:54,760
<i>Something huge.</i>

1112
01:34:01,433 --> 01:34:03,519
<i>Let's just say it, let's just say it!</i>

1113
01:34:03,644 --> 01:34:04,853
<i>A boner.</i>

1114
01:34:09,274 --> 01:34:10,484
<i>I know.</i>

1115
01:34:14,988 --> 01:34:17,366
<i>A boner, that's what I get.</i>

1116
01:34:17,449 --> 01:34:20,452
<i>That's what I get</i>
<i>for trying to do everything myself.</i>

1117
01:34:20,536 --> 01:34:22,871
<i>Boner Bob, my neighbor.</i>

1118
01:34:34,591 --> 01:34:36,260
<i>Oh, dear.</i>

1119
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:46,103
<i>He rooted for all of you.</i>

1120
01:34:51,942 --> 01:34:53,277
<i>I love you.</i>

1121
01:34:54,069 --> 01:34:56,530
<i>This is for you, your favorite song...</i>

1122
01:34:59,283 --> 01:35:01,076
<i>on a Saturday night.</i>

1123
01:37:02,239 --> 01:37:04,366
Well, you really brought
everybody together...

1124
01:37:04,491 --> 01:37:06,201
I'll give you that.

1125
01:37:19,298 --> 01:37:21,341
I have this thing for you.

1126
01:37:25,220 --> 01:37:27,097
It's a very unique map.

1127
01:37:29,391 --> 01:37:31,268
It's for your road trip home.

1128
01:37:31,685 --> 01:37:33,145
Right, a map.

1129
01:37:36,231 --> 01:37:38,108
You promised. Remember?

1130
01:37:39,318 --> 01:37:41,695
No. No, I do, I remember.

1131
01:37:52,080 --> 01:37:53,957
This is for you, Mitch.

1132
01:38:26,281 --> 01:38:27,824
<i>Free Bird,</i> huh?

1133
01:38:31,495 --> 01:38:33,789
- Well, I better get back to...
- Ben.

1134
01:38:37,709 --> 01:38:39,461
He finally made it.

1135
01:38:42,339 --> 01:38:44,132
Does Ben even exist?

1136
01:38:53,475 --> 01:38:56,687
Just call me when you get home...

1137
01:38:57,563 --> 01:38:59,064
and not until.

1138
01:39:00,107 --> 01:39:03,193
I want you to get into the deep...

1139
01:39:03,610 --> 01:39:06,864
beautiful melancholy
of everything that's happened.

1140
01:39:14,955 --> 01:39:16,582
It's a great map.

1141
01:40:01,710 --> 01:40:03,337
- Jessie!
- Just keep going!

1142
01:40:34,952 --> 01:40:36,328
Oh, my God!

1143
01:40:59,935 --> 01:41:03,438
I am a licensed flight attendant!
Use this exit, please!

1144
01:41:28,672 --> 01:41:31,633
<i>As a specialist</i>
<i>in the field of last looks...</i>

1145
01:41:32,801 --> 01:41:36,138
<i>this one was pretty iconically Claire.</i>

1146
01:41:58,160 --> 01:42:01,163
Friends and neighbors,
we are gathered here...

1147
01:42:01,663 --> 01:42:05,292
to say our final goodbyes
to our dear friend...

1148
01:42:05,959 --> 01:42:07,127
Mitch.

1149
01:42:43,372 --> 01:42:44,414
Come on, General.

1150
01:42:57,970 --> 01:43:00,055
<i>The route of Claire's map...</i>

1151
01:43:00,722 --> 01:43:04,017
<i>with accompanying music</i>
<i>and detailed instructions...</i>

1152
01:43:04,434 --> 01:43:07,479
<i>would take 42 hours...</i>

1153
01:43:08,146 --> 01:43:09,648
<i>and 11 minutes.</i>

1154
01:43:10,649 --> 01:43:11,733
"Turn on ignition."

1155
01:43:27,875 --> 01:43:30,544
<i>"Begin your journey</i>
<i>and do not skip ahead."</i>

1156
01:43:55,777 --> 01:43:57,362
<i>She had laid out the entire road trip...</i>

1157
01:43:58,572 --> 01:44:00,866
<i>and timed it to music</i>
<i>she herself had put on CDs.</i>

1158
01:44:06,622 --> 01:44:10,209
<i>The songs, of course,</i>
<i>were classic mix tape songs.</i>

1159
01:44:10,292 --> 01:44:12,127
<i>About her, of course.</i>

1160
01:44:13,253 --> 01:44:16,381
<i>And the rich flurry</i>
<i>of our almost romance.</i>

1161
01:44:27,809 --> 01:44:28,936
<i>60B.</i>

1162
01:44:41,073 --> 01:44:42,866
<i>This is The Hombres.</i>

1163
01:44:55,128 --> 01:44:58,549
<i>And she had even provided music</i>
<i>for what would happen next.</i>

1164
01:45:02,511 --> 01:45:03,804
<i>Down to the minute.</i>

1165
01:45:29,955 --> 01:45:33,500
<i>You have five minutes to wallow</i>
<i>in the delicious misery.</i>

1166
01:45:33,876 --> 01:45:37,337
<i>Enjoy it, embrace it, discard it...</i>

1167
01:45:39,882 --> 01:45:41,008
<i>and proceed.</i>

1168
01:45:51,894 --> 01:45:55,355
<i>Here is a river</i>
<i>leading to the Mississippi.</i>

1169
01:45:58,233 --> 01:46:00,861
<i>"This is America," she wrote.</i>

1170
01:46:01,695 --> 01:46:05,032
<i>And if everybody gets a vote</i>
<i>where their Mitch gets buried...</i>

1171
01:46:06,658 --> 01:46:09,453
<i>here are a few</i>
<i>where my Mitch gets buried.</i>

1172
01:46:09,786 --> 01:46:11,246
<i>Or scattered.</i>

1173
01:46:26,762 --> 01:46:30,224
<i>"Pause for 30 minutes</i>
<i>for the greatest chili in the world."</i>

1174
01:46:32,434 --> 01:46:34,436
<i>And elsewhere in Memphis.</i>

1175
01:46:48,200 --> 01:46:50,744
<i>This would be a good time</i>
<i>to stop in at Earnestine & Hazel's...</i>

1176
01:46:51,995 --> 01:46:53,372
<i>and say hello to Russ.</i>

1177
01:46:53,455 --> 01:46:54,623
How you doing?

1178
01:46:54,748 --> 01:46:57,918
<i>He's hung onto the place</i>

<i>He'll tell you a few stories.</i>

1180
01:47:05,467 --> 01:47:08,804
Look. Look at this. That's the blues!

1181
01:47:11,723 --> 01:47:14,977
<i>And just around the corner,</i>
<i>the Lorraine Motel.</i>

1182
01:47:19,022 --> 01:47:23,318
<i>The hotel balcony where</i>
<i>Martin Luther King drew his last breath.</i>

1183
01:48:05,235 --> 01:48:08,447
<i>His death was only the beginning</i>
<i>of his victory.</i>

1184
01:48:11,074 --> 01:48:13,660
<i>You go across the bridge</i>
<i>traversing Mark Twain's muse...</i>

1185
01:48:13,785 --> 01:48:15,412
<i>Jeff Buckley's funeral bed...</i>

1186
01:48:15,537 --> 01:48:17,331
<i>as the night air</i>
<i>whips through your hair...</i>

1187

<i>around your face,</i>
<i>and out the other window.</i>

1188
01:48:19,333 --> 01:48:23,712
<i>You can feel the soul of that dark water</i>
<i>even as you arrive on the other side.</i>

1189
01:48:47,069 --> 01:48:49,530
<i>Some music needs air.</i>

1190
01:48:50,364 --> 01:48:52,199
<i>Roll down your window.</i>

1191
01:49:04,920 --> 01:49:07,089
- All right! Good!
- I love you, Daddy.

1192
01:49:07,214 --> 01:49:09,883
<i>I love you too, Drew.</i>
<i>Where do you want to go?</i>

1193
01:49:09,967 --> 01:49:11,426
<i>- Tucky.</i>
<i>- Kentucky?</i>

1194
01:49:36,326 --> 01:49:37,786
<i>Good morning.</i>

1196
01:49:51,717 --> 01:49:53,385
<i>The Survivor Tree.</i>

1197
01:49:53,886 --> 01:49:57,055
<i>It's my favorite tree in the world.</i>

1198
01:49:57,973 --> 01:49:59,766
<i>And I like trees.</i>

1199

You with your many almost-great

Oh, God.

1207
01:51:25,727 --> 01:51:27,896
Both of us working so hard...

for what?

1209
01:51:35,070 --> 01:51:37,823
We should have taken this trip
years ago.

1210

And the fact that I wanna go home
and kill myself is really not your fault.

1211
