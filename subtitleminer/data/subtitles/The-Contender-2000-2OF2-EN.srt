00:00:01,473 --> 00:00:05,335
for her activities
in college.

2
00:00:05,409 --> 00:00:08,475
I didn't hear about this.

3
00:00:08,545 --> 00:00:12,320
Well, it's, uh...
It's, um...

4
00:00:12,385 --> 00:00:15,800
It'll be in...
tomorrow afternoon's edition.

5
00:00:15,873 --> 00:00:18,077
Just in time for the congressman
to make his statement...

6
00:00:18,145 --> 00:00:23,230
and just in time for it to stick in
the minds of Americans over the weekend.

7
00:00:23,297 --> 00:00:25,818
Wh... What's the source?
Where'd they get the story?

8
00:00:25,889 --> 00:00:30,112
- Unnamed sources
close to the investigation.
- I see.

9
00:00:33,857 --> 00:00:35,548
Al.

10
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:37,473
- Al!
- Yes?

11
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:42,491
We can, um... Let's...

12
00:00:42,561 --> 00:00:46,139
<i>Let's dot the I's, cross the T's
on this one later.</i>

13
00:00:46,209 --> 00:00:48,348
All right, thank you.

14
00:00:49,377 --> 00:00:51,232
I, uh...

15
00:00:51,297 --> 00:00:56,512
I think I have some self-righteous
indignation coming my way.

16
00:00:56,578 --> 00:00:59,196
Well, is there any truth
whatsoever to the story?

17
00:00:59,266 --> 00:01:03,128
- There will be an investigation.
- She's gonna have the truth on her side.

18
00:01:03,202 --> 00:01:05,885
- She's gonna deny it and
make us all look like fools.
- Let her.

19
00:01:05,953 --> 00:01:09,783
Let her deny just that part
of the story.

20
00:01:09,857 --> 00:01:13,086
- Hold here.
- What? Oh.

21
00:01:13,154 --> 00:01:16,023
That's all right.
I can do that myself. Yeah.

22
00:01:16,097 --> 00:01:17,788
Thank you.

23
00:01:17,858 --> 00:01:22,527
<i>- America Live is not in
the circus business.
- Pete's always fair.</i>

24
00:01:22,593 --> 00:01:25,375
<i>Should I hear anything in this?</i>

25
00:01:25,442 --> 00:01:27,198
<i>You're gonna be vice president.</i>

26
00:01:27,265 --> 00:01:29,272
<i>- You'll talk about
legitimate issues of concern.
- Right.</i>

27
00:01:29,345 --> 00:01:31,200
Where is the senator's monitor?

28
00:01:31,265 --> 00:01:33,240
There is no monitor for her.
She'll hear Pete in the earpiece.

29
00:01:33,313 --> 00:01:35,648
That is a piece of shit.
We talked about this, Ray.

30
00:01:35,713 --> 00:01:38,909
<i>If Peter's gonna be able to see her,
she has to be able to see him.</i>

31
00:01:38,977 --> 00:01:41,279
- He's got a sensory advantage over her.
- You wanna pull her?

32
00:01:41,345 --> 00:01:43,996
I'm not talking about pulling her.
I'm just saying it's bullshit.

33
00:01:44,065 --> 00:01:48,026
She was just great in the hearings
today. Cool and collected.

34
00:01:48,097 --> 00:01:49,952
- Steve Poullet.
- Hi.

35
00:01:53,473 --> 00:01:56,507
Should I hear anything?
Oh, I got it. Okay, great.

36
00:01:56,577 --> 00:01:58,431
Oh, it's that one.
Yeah, I know.

37
00:01:58,497 --> 00:02:01,496
Can't hear...
Yeah, right, got it.

38
00:02:01,568 --> 00:02:04,416
<i>Okay, I've got
the intro now.</i>

39
00:02:12,545 --> 00:02:14,933
Thank you for having me, Peter.

40
00:02:16,161 --> 00:02:18,681
Sure, that'd be fine.

41
00:02:20,768 --> 00:02:23,899
Well, it has been
a taxing experience...

42
00:02:23,969 --> 00:02:27,481
<i>but if we're forced to take
the voters out of the equation...</i>

43
00:02:27,552 --> 00:02:32,735
<i>I think that the vetting system
by simple necessity must be arduous.</i>

44
00:02:36,609 --> 00:02:38,681
Mmm.

45
00:02:38,753 --> 00:02:41,175
<i>I have to plead motherhood
on that one, Pete...</i>

46
00:02:41,248 --> 00:02:43,103
<i>but I not only served
on the Foreign Relations Committee...</i>

47
00:02:43,168 --> 00:02:47,641
<i>I sponsored the Hanson-Fineman Bill
which readjusted the War Powers Act...</i>

48
00:02:47,712 --> 00:02:51,193
<i>to allow the executive to respond
to state-sponsored terrorism...</i>

49
00:02:51,265 --> 00:02:54,613
like that of Iraq, Libya,
North Korea, for instance.

50
00:02:54,688 --> 00:02:57,077
But rather than boring you
with my résumé...

51
00:02:57,152 --> 00:03:01,462
I'd rather answer your questions
on specific issues of foreign policy.

52
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,702
I suppose I could ask you, Mr. Crenshaw,
how you'd feel in the same situation.

53
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,288
Why would I answer that for you?
Sorry. It's simply a privacy issue.

54
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,707
Look, I won't address issues
of sexuality in a hearing room...

55
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:26,012
or on national television
or anywhere else for that matter.

56
00:03:27,968 --> 00:03:32,092
<i>- Where's the control room
for America Live?
- Down the hall.</i>

57
00:03:32,161 --> 00:03:34,495
<i>Excuse me.
The control room for America Live?</i>

58
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,757
- Where is the fucking control room?
- Right down there.

59
00:03:37,824 --> 00:03:39,929
Fuck!

60
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,171
Down here, down here, down here!

61
00:03:45,632 --> 00:03:47,737
Don't tell me
we're gettin' sandbagged!

62
00:03:47,808 --> 00:03:51,321
We're getting sandbagged! I knew
you couldn't trust this fucking guy!

63
00:03:51,392 --> 00:03:54,807
<i>Senator Hanson,
do you recognize Mr. Poullet?</i>

64
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:58,360
Un, no. I don't have a monitor,
so I can't see him.

65
00:03:58,432 --> 00:04:00,799
<i> The truth is,
Lainey and I had that one incident.</i>

66
00:04:00,863 --> 00:04:03,449
<i>I don't believe we ever
saw each other again after that.</i>

67
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,520
To her credit, she was very drunk
when she had sex...

68
00:04:06,592 --> 00:04:08,414
with my friends,
uh, my brothers and I.

69
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,302
A sandbag is what it is.
He's fucking your friend.

70
00:04:13,376 --> 00:04:16,507
He has obviously infiltrated
your show.

71
00:04:16,575 --> 00:04:19,707
Mrs. Hanson, you still have not taken
a stand on the accuracy of this report.

72
00:04:19,776 --> 00:04:23,453
<i>It's very accurate,
and those photos are accurate too.</i>

73
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,007
We had them on the frat house
bulletin board for months.

74
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:27,934
We called that
"Life in the Sex Laine."

75
00:04:27,999 --> 00:04:32,342
- What are we gonna do now?
- We're gonna sue him.

76
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:36,212
I will not dignify those remarks
or your questions with a response.

77
00:04:36,287 --> 00:04:38,175
Good evening.

78
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,928
<i>The guy's a jerk. We're never gonna
put our people on that show again.</i>

79
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,735
Some asshole called in
and made this idiot claim.

80
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,385
Hell, they've gotta investigate.

81
00:04:51,455 --> 00:04:53,560
The whole situation's
a son of a bitch.

82
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:56,119
<i>I would like to start
by saying...</i>

83
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:59,420
<i>that much has been made of the reports
in the press of an investigation...</i>

84
00:04:59,487 --> 00:05:02,716
<i>into the possible...
possible, I say again...</i>

85
00:05:02,783 --> 00:05:06,329
criminal behavior
on the part of the nominee.

86
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:10,774
This committee will wait
for a report from the FBI...

87
00:05:10,847 --> 00:05:13,847
<i>before taking this matter up.</i>

88
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:18,327
However, I'll once again afford
the nominee an opportunity to respond.

89
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:21,596
I, too, will wait for the FBI report
before responding.

90
00:05:21,663 --> 00:05:24,598
<i>Madam Senator.</i>

91
00:05:24,671 --> 00:05:28,152
Tell us a little bit about your family.
You have a son.

92
00:05:28,223 --> 00:05:31,157
Mm-hmm. Yes, I have
one six-year-old boy, Timothy.

93
00:05:31,231 --> 00:05:33,206
<i>That's a very nice age.</i>

94
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:36,574
<i>Now, I see here
that when you...</i>

95
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,705
had Timothy,
you were absent from your duty...

96
00:05:39,775 --> 00:05:42,328
for a few months'
maternity leave.

97
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:47,450
<i>- It's the right of every mother
to be able to take maternity...
- Paid maternity leave.</i>

98
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:50,389
Yes. I don't believe we should penalize
our citizens for having children.

99
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:55,132
<i>I think I'm on safe ground saying that
valuing motherhood is quite nonpartisan.</i>

100
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,284
<i>- Um, were you to get pregnant again...</i>

101
00:06:00,351 --> 00:06:02,969
do you plan
to take maternity leave?

102
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,781
Um, I've not given that
any consideration.

103
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:09,716
<i>No? Are you still able
to bear children?</i>

104
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:11,547
Yes, I am...
I believe, yes, I am.

105
00:06:11,615 --> 00:06:14,070
<i>Yet you have not given
this matter any consideration.</i>

106
00:06:14,143 --> 00:06:17,591
Perhaps that means...
No, strike that.

107
00:06:20,991 --> 00:06:23,260
Madam Senator...

108
00:06:23,327 --> 00:06:28,662
let us assume you ascended
to the presidency...

109
00:06:28,735 --> 00:06:32,248
and you were to have a child
during your term.

110
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,807
Would you cede your duties
to your vice president and for how long?

111
00:06:34,878 --> 00:06:37,846
<i>Mr. Chairman, would the chair
expect to have the designate
assure this committee...</i>

112
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,432
<i>that she would have her tubes tied
before she assume office?</i>

113
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:45,725
<i>- Mr. Chairman, I humbly
request a point of order.
- You will be afforded one.</i>

114
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:49,086
<i>- With all due respect...
- You will be afforded one
when I am finished.</i>

115
00:06:49,151 --> 00:06:53,307
<i>The truth is that while we have
not put a seal on the concept
of having another child...</i>

116
00:06:53,374 --> 00:06:55,447
my husband and I practice
birth control.

117
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:58,236
Mm-hmm.

118
00:07:02,782 --> 00:07:07,638
Okay, I would
now like to...

119
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:10,874
<i>enter the arena of loyalty.</i>

120
00:07:10,942 --> 00:07:14,837
Loyalty is a revered quality
among vice presidents. Would you agree?

121
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:18,009
<i>- Yes, very much so. Yes.
- Yet you chose to officially move...</i>

122
00:07:18,078 --> 00:07:22,999
from the Republican to the
Democratic party when you left
the House to run for the Senate.

123
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:26,714
I view switching parties as a testament
to my loyalty to my country.

124
00:07:26,782 --> 00:07:32,150
I felt that the Republican party
had shifted from the ideals that
I cherished through my youth.

125
00:07:32,222 --> 00:07:35,222
As a Republican,
did you ever...

126
00:07:35,294 --> 00:07:38,228
vote along party lines
but against your own beliefs?

127
00:07:38,302 --> 00:07:39,676
No, never.

128
00:07:39,742 --> 00:07:41,596
<i>- You still believe in
every vote you made?
- Yes.</i>

129
00:07:41,662 --> 00:07:44,728
<i>- Including your vote
to impeach President Clinton?
- Yes, I do.</i>

130
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,652
That was an issue of fairness.

131
00:07:46,718 --> 00:07:50,580
The president,
as commander in chief, stood by...

132
00:07:50,654 --> 00:07:55,323
<i>while several military officers,
including candidates for the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs...</i>

133
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,725
<i>were prosecuted for adultery
or were not permitted...</i>

134
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,644
to advance their careers.

135
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:05,045
I am opposed to making adultery,
or even lying about it,
a crime in our armed forces.

136
00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:09,242
But while it is a law,
it should be enforced
without consideration of rank...

137
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:12,027
<i>even if that rank
is commander in chief.</i>

138
00:08:12,094 --> 00:08:16,567
Perhaps the senator is unaware
that commander in chief
is not actually a military rank.

139
00:08:16,638 --> 00:08:18,492
<i>I am aware of that.</i>

140
00:08:18,558 --> 00:08:24,154
What I think we can say
of President Clinton is that he
was not guilty but responsible.

141
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:31,900
"Not guilty but responsible."

142
00:08:31,966 --> 00:08:35,315
I am...
I like that.

143
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:38,903
I, uh, I-I may, uh... I may use that.

144
00:08:38,973 --> 00:08:41,690
<i>- If you wish, you can go ahead.
- Thank you.</i>

145
00:08:41,758 --> 00:08:46,230
<i>When...
When considering you
for the vice presidency...</i>

146
00:08:46,301 --> 00:08:50,873
we must also consider your worthiness
as commander in chief.

147
00:08:50,941 --> 00:08:52,403
<i>- Would you agree?
- Yes, I do.</i>

148
00:08:52,478 --> 00:08:54,485
<i>In that case, given your feelings
on the matter...</i>

149
00:08:54,558 --> 00:08:56,663
have you ever
committed adultery?

150
00:08:56,734 --> 00:08:58,457
<i>- No, I have not.
- No?</i>

151
00:08:58,525 --> 00:09:03,032
You're quite sure? Madam Senator, you
understand that, uh, you are under oath.

152
00:09:03,102 --> 00:09:07,063
Yes, I understand that, between the two
of us, I'm the one that's under oath.

153
00:09:07,134 --> 00:09:10,876
<i>When you guys go before
the Antitrust Committee,
don't you want Hank on your side?</i>

154
00:09:10,941 --> 00:09:13,275
<i>Sure, but not at any price.</i>

155
00:09:13,341 --> 00:09:15,316
Last time we spoke,
you were sitting where you are now.

156
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:18,553
Hank was sitting where Len is.
You started telling him
what a shame it would be...

157
00:09:18,621 --> 00:09:21,752
if the refrigeration systems
on the trucks went out.

158
00:09:21,821 --> 00:09:23,894
Hank's a hothead,
and he took that as a threat.

159
00:09:23,966 --> 00:09:25,820
If we were threatening him,
he'd know it.

160
00:09:25,886 --> 00:09:28,252
That's what I thought,
but now we have some massaging to do.

161
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:29,976
Hank's gotta be treated
with kid gloves.

162
00:09:30,045 --> 00:09:33,176
<i>- Senator Hanson?
Congressman Webster's here to see you.
- Sorry. Yep?</i>

163
00:09:33,245 --> 00:09:35,514
- Guess we got our ten minutes.
- Okay, send him in.

164
00:09:35,581 --> 00:09:39,411
No, I want to resolve this.
I do. Just give me a few minutes.

165
00:09:39,485 --> 00:09:42,616
If you want something to drink,
Jerry will take care of you.

166
00:09:42,685 --> 00:09:46,230
- We're gonna get back into this?
- We will. We will.

167
00:09:49,533 --> 00:09:53,494
Senator, you want me to sit in?
Make sure the congressman's
clear on everything?

168
00:09:53,565 --> 00:09:57,111
<i>We'll be fine. Won't we, Mr. Webster?
We'll be all right. Thanks.</i>

169
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:01,144
Proud of yourself?

170
00:10:06,461 --> 00:10:09,396
So, what can I do for you,
Mr. Webster?

171
00:10:09,469 --> 00:10:12,251
I'm sure you're wondering
why I'm here.

172
00:10:12,317 --> 00:10:14,837
I think you're here because you want
to know why I'm not fighting back.

173
00:10:14,908 --> 00:10:19,284
<i>Because despite it all, you've got
some odd sense of fair play.</i>

174
00:10:19,356 --> 00:10:23,033
You're kicking my ass.
It's gone from feeling like
easy pickings to out-and-out bullying.

175
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,719
I feel like there should be
some back and forth between us,
you and the committee.

176
00:10:25,789 --> 00:10:29,138
<i>I'll give you back and forth on Social
Security, relations with Israel...</i>

177
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:33,784
on the Dow Jones, the census,
almost everything, but not this.

178
00:10:33,852 --> 00:10:37,747
No, not my personal life.
It's just nobody's business.

179
00:10:37,821 --> 00:10:40,723
That's not what the people
will tell you; the people will
tell you it is their business...

180
00:10:40,797 --> 00:10:43,514
that you're setting standards
of morality for their children.

181
00:10:43,581 --> 00:10:45,719
Especially their girls.

182
00:10:45,788 --> 00:10:47,676
Have you ever heard
of Isaac Lamm?

183
00:10:47,741 --> 00:10:51,996
<i>- Isaac Lamm? No.
- He was the first one
to come before HUAC...</i>

184
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,165
the House Un-American
Activities Committee.

185
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:58,393
He was also the first one to name names,
first to cooperate with the government.

186
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,347
The dominoes fell from there.

187
00:11:00,413 --> 00:11:02,933
<i>Careers crushed,
families destroyed.</i>

188
00:11:03,004 --> 00:11:07,576
Just imagine, Mr. Webster,
if Mr. Lamm had just said,
"Fuck you," to the committee.

189
00:11:07,645 --> 00:11:09,652
Imagine how much harder
he would've made it for them.

190
00:11:09,724 --> 00:11:14,001
Are you accusing the committee
of sexual McCarthyism?

191
00:11:14,076 --> 00:11:17,818
Well, it's not necessary
to make the accusation.

192
00:11:17,884 --> 00:11:21,529
Oh, I just can't respond
to the committee's lightly
veiled accusations...

193
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:23,735
because it's not okay
for them to be made.

194
00:11:23,804 --> 00:11:28,409
Or maybe you can't respond
because the answers you have
to give are too embarrassing.

195
00:11:29,725 --> 00:11:31,612
You know what?

196
00:11:31,676 --> 00:11:33,531
You're young.

197
00:11:33,596 --> 00:11:35,484
That's okay. That's okay.
You're young.

198
00:11:35,548 --> 00:11:40,534
I'm gonna choose to be amused
by your naiveté, give you
the benefit of the doubt.

199
00:11:40,604 --> 00:11:43,025
I'm gonna spell it out
for you even more clearly.

200
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,107
If I were a man,
nobody would care...

201
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,482
how many sexual partners
I had in college.

202
00:11:47,548 --> 00:11:51,858
<i>And if it's not relevant for a man,
it's not relevant for a woman.</i>

203
00:11:53,596 --> 00:11:57,720
Jerry, send the folks back in, please.
I gotta finish this up.

204
00:11:57,788 --> 00:12:00,690
<i>He's not a bad man.</i>

205
00:12:00,764 --> 00:12:02,967
<i>He believes in what he's doing.</i>

206
00:12:03,036 --> 00:12:05,370
<i>There's an odd sort
of integrity there.</i>

207
00:12:05,436 --> 00:12:07,291
<i>But in this business,
with so much at stake...</i>

208
00:12:07,356 --> 00:12:11,829
it's not enough to believe
in yourself, you have to be right.

209
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:16,722
This is an ideological rape
of all women.

210
00:12:16,796 --> 00:12:19,763
- Timmy, that's a little too high.
- Okay, Mommy.

211
00:12:19,836 --> 00:12:22,618
Thank you, sweetie.

212
00:12:22,683 --> 00:12:26,709
Well, then I'll survive it
for all of us.

213
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:31,002
<i>Tomorrow morning Congressman Marshall
is gonna ask you questions.</i>

214
00:12:31,068 --> 00:12:32,978
He's going to hit you
with abortion.

215
00:12:33,051 --> 00:12:36,532
I promise you that Shelly will find
some way to call you a baby killer.

216
00:12:36,604 --> 00:12:40,564
<i>We're ready for him.
Our position papers are first-rate.</i>

217
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:43,221
<i>- Every one of them.
- You let him finish.</i>

218
00:12:43,292 --> 00:12:47,864
Then you look him in the eye
and you ask him...

219
00:12:47,932 --> 00:12:51,477
"Mr. Runyon, 20 years ago
your wife Maggie had an abortion.

220
00:12:51,547 --> 00:12:53,555
Do you think her a murderer?"

221
00:12:56,091 --> 00:12:58,458
<i>He's a hypocrite.</i>

222
00:12:58,523 --> 00:13:01,752
No, he's not.
Shelly has no idea.

223
00:13:04,187 --> 00:13:06,554
Are you saying you would appoint
a Supreme Court justice...

224
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,653
<i>based on his being pro-choice?</i>

225
00:13:09,723 --> 00:13:13,913
Mr. Marshall, the vice president
does not appoint Supreme Court justices.

226
00:13:13,979 --> 00:13:17,809
Should you succeed the president
or even advise the president?

227
00:13:17,883 --> 00:13:20,753
I would be inclined,
though not without flexibility...

228
00:13:20,828 --> 00:13:24,537
to disregard any man or woman who is
pro-life from serving on the High Court.

229
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:29,491
So you would allow a personal political
belief to enter into such a decision?

230
00:13:29,563 --> 00:13:32,149
Abortion isn't
a constitutional issue.

231
00:13:32,219 --> 00:13:34,586
The fine ladies and gentlemen
who serve on the Supreme Court...

232
00:13:34,651 --> 00:13:36,506
which is now stacked
with right-wing appointees...

233
00:13:36,571 --> 00:13:41,143
have no business deciding whether women
have to resort to back-alley abortions...

234
00:13:41,211 --> 00:13:45,040
You mean they have no business
deciding whether women have
a license to commit murder.

235
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:47,319
<i>Mr. Marshall, your time has expired.</i>

236
00:13:47,387 --> 00:13:52,472
Sir, if the distinguished "gentlelady"
from Ohio would answer the question...

237
00:13:52,539 --> 00:13:55,027
<i>I think the lady has made clear
her propensity for abortion.</i>

238
00:13:55,099 --> 00:14:00,336
<i>- Come on, Mr. Runyon!
- Mr. Lewis, you do not
have speaking privileges.</i>

239
00:14:00,411 --> 00:14:03,378
Mr. Chairman, I find your term,
"propensity for abortion"...

240
00:14:03,451 --> 00:14:05,338
misrepresentative of my position.

241
00:14:05,402 --> 00:14:08,719
I have a propensity
for a woman's right to choose.

242
00:14:08,795 --> 00:14:11,794
<i>- To abort a child!
- A fetus.</i>

243
00:14:11,867 --> 00:14:16,123
To kill a baby
as it grows in the womb.

244
00:14:18,075 --> 00:14:20,344
Personally, Senator...

245
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:25,364
I do not believe that it is
the right of our citizens...

246
00:14:25,435 --> 00:14:30,169
to... to butcher
a defenseless human being simply...

247
00:14:30,235 --> 00:14:33,682
simply as a matter of choice.

248
00:14:33,754 --> 00:14:37,202
At the risk of my own future,
I tell you this:

249
00:14:37,275 --> 00:14:39,347
If you support the right...

250
00:14:39,418 --> 00:14:43,030
<i>of a woman to choose,
you are supporting...</i>

251
00:14:43,098 --> 00:14:47,833
nothing less than
a-a-a holocaust of the unborn.

252
00:14:47,898 --> 00:14:51,346
Mr. Chairman,
are you calling me...

253
00:15:16,058 --> 00:15:18,676
I believe my position
on this issue is clear.

254
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:23,317
Yes, madam,
it most certainly is.

255
00:15:27,099 --> 00:15:29,270
God, I love this game.

256
00:15:31,674 --> 00:15:34,576
When she tries to tell me
how to do it, I do it my way.

257
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:38,578
Then she comes back and changes it
afterwards, and that way...

258
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:41,912
Jeez.

259
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:46,261
Good one, sir.

260
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:49,200
You're an all-weather golfer,
I see.

261
00:15:49,274 --> 00:15:51,129
What kind of stick
you using there?

262
00:15:51,194 --> 00:15:54,096
- It's a putting stick.
- Right, putting stick.

263
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:57,040
When I asked for you last week,
they said you were in Vegas.

264
00:15:57,114 --> 00:15:59,798
- Business, sir.
- Vegas is business?

265
00:15:59,866 --> 00:16:02,713
I did blow
a roll of quarters.

266
00:16:02,778 --> 00:16:04,632
Will you excuse us?

267
00:16:12,474 --> 00:16:15,736
- How's that cough doing?
- Aah.

268
00:16:17,722 --> 00:16:20,592
That's her casino account balance.

269
00:16:20,665 --> 00:16:24,943
She offered to take her sorority sister
to Vegas, her treat.

270
00:16:27,962 --> 00:16:32,915
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth and nothing
but the truth so help you God?

271
00:16:32,986 --> 00:16:34,873
I do.

272
00:16:37,306 --> 00:16:40,273
<i>Please state your name
for the record.</i>

273
00:16:40,346 --> 00:16:44,568
Cynthia C-H-A-R-L-T-O-N Lee.

274
00:16:44,634 --> 00:16:47,895
<i>Thank you.
Please be seated.</i>

275
00:16:49,402 --> 00:16:54,934
<i>We will start the questioning
with Mr. Skakle.</i>

276
00:16:55,002 --> 00:16:58,198
<i>Mr. Skakle, the five-minute rule
is in effect.</i>

277
00:16:58,265 --> 00:17:00,916
<i>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</i>

278
00:17:00,985 --> 00:17:03,440
<i>Miss Lee.</i>

279
00:17:03,513 --> 00:17:07,157
Miss Lee, hello. I'm over here.
Thank you for joining us.

280
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:10,771
Now, you are under subpoena,
is that correct?

281
00:17:10,841 --> 00:17:12,816
Yes.

282
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:16,850
<i>- Miss Lee, could you speak
directly into the mike?
- Yes.</i>

283
00:17:16,921 --> 00:17:20,085
<i>I understand you're nervous, but believe
me when I tell you you're among friends.</i>

284
00:17:21,721 --> 00:17:23,925
<i>Miss Lee, you are not married.</i>

285
00:17:23,993 --> 00:17:26,481
No... No.

286
00:17:26,553 --> 00:17:29,138
<i>- No, I'm not.
- But you once were.</i>

287
00:17:29,209 --> 00:17:31,762
I was married
to William Hanson.

288
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:34,965
<i>- Who is now married to the nominee.
- Yes.</i>

289
00:17:35,034 --> 00:17:39,190
He married Laine after our divorce.
It was about seven years ago.

290
00:17:39,257 --> 00:17:42,007
<i>Divorce. Right.
I've read your divorce papers.</i>

291
00:17:42,073 --> 00:17:46,328
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
that by the way is tab 76.</i>

292
00:17:46,393 --> 00:17:49,110
<i>They cite
irreconcilable differences.</i>

293
00:17:49,177 --> 00:17:53,400
<i>Could you tell us, what were
those irreconcilable differences?</i>

294
00:17:53,465 --> 00:17:55,287
I can't really pinpoint them.

295
00:17:55,353 --> 00:17:59,149
<i>- Was your husband
physically violent to you?
- No.</i>

296
00:17:59,225 --> 00:18:03,316
<i>Did you have financial
disagreements or disagreements
over how to raise your kids?</i>

297
00:18:03,385 --> 00:18:05,272
We didn't have children.

298
00:18:05,337 --> 00:18:09,647
<i>- Were there infidelities?
- Yes. There was one.</i>

299
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:13,333
<i>Is it safe to say that this infidelity
precipitated the divorce?</i>

300
00:18:16,505 --> 00:18:20,531
Miss Lee, please answer
the question verbally. Was that a yes?

301
00:18:20,601 --> 00:18:23,601
Yes, it was.
It was a yes.

302
00:18:23,673 --> 00:18:26,488
<i>- Did you, ma'am, have the affair?
- No.</i>

303
00:18:26,553 --> 00:18:29,073
- It was your husband then?
- Yes.

304
00:18:29,145 --> 00:18:32,309
Will...
Will was in charge...

305
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:36,850
<i>of Laine Billings's
first senatorial campaign.</i>

306
00:18:36,921 --> 00:18:38,863
He was with her all the time.

307
00:18:38,937 --> 00:18:42,515
Are you suggesting the senator,
the nominee, had an affair
with your husband?

308
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,601
- Once again, Miss Lee...
- I'm sorry. Yes. Yes, yes.

309
00:18:47,673 --> 00:18:49,527
<i>Thank you.</i>

310
00:18:49,593 --> 00:18:51,731
Did the nominee know
Mr. Hanson was married?

311
00:18:53,497 --> 00:18:56,596
Laine was my friend.
My good, good friend.

312
00:18:56,665 --> 00:18:59,599
<i>Miss Lee, would you explain
to this committee as you
did in your deposition...</i>

313
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:04,047
<i>how you discovered
that the nominee was involved...</i>

314
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,389
in an affair
with your husband?

315
00:19:06,456 --> 00:19:09,588
Yes. Um...

316
00:19:09,657 --> 00:19:12,952
On the night of the elections,
I was at home.

317
00:19:13,016 --> 00:19:15,187
I had the flu.

318
00:19:15,256 --> 00:19:20,078
I was watching TV, watching Laine
about to make her acceptance speech.

319
00:19:22,456 --> 00:19:24,595
I was very sad
that I couldn't be there.

320
00:19:24,665 --> 00:19:28,210
It was a triumph
for Laine and my husband.

321
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:32,055
<i>She was up at the podium.
Will was by her side.</i>

322
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,509
<i>He was holding her hand
in victory.</i>

323
00:19:34,584 --> 00:19:37,072
<i>On the other side
of Laine...</i>

324
00:19:37,144 --> 00:19:40,406
<i>she was just sort of clasping
that person's hand.</i>

325
00:19:40,472 --> 00:19:43,768
<i>But with Will...</i>

326
00:19:43,832 --> 00:19:46,385
their hands were interlaced.

327
00:19:46,456 --> 00:19:49,620
It was odd
that I noticed it, but...

328
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:52,470
Um, my doorbell rang.

329
00:19:52,536 --> 00:19:55,503
I answered the door,
and there was a gentleman there...

330
00:19:55,576 --> 00:19:59,504
dressed very nicely,
he had a yellow tie on.

331
00:19:59,576 --> 00:20:01,715
He had papers for me.

332
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:04,686
<i>- Papers? I'm sorry.
- Separation papers.</i>

333
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:09,266
<i>Since the committee
chose to humiliate a private woman
in the most public possible setting...</i>

334
00:20:09,336 --> 00:20:12,020
I would like to apologize
to her alike...

335
00:20:12,088 --> 00:20:15,666
and I will also do so privately
when she allows me to do so.

336
00:20:15,736 --> 00:20:19,926
Um, what I did to Miss Lee
was wrong.

337
00:20:19,992 --> 00:20:22,742
It was not done out of malice.
Indeed the opposite.

338
00:20:22,808 --> 00:20:25,710
Um...

339
00:20:25,784 --> 00:20:30,006
love is an involuntary reflex,
and I fell victim to it.

340
00:20:30,072 --> 00:20:34,130
Um, I deeply regret
causing Cynthia pain...

341
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:37,996
and it is especially saddening
for me because...

342
00:20:38,072 --> 00:20:41,388
of how close we once were.

343
00:20:41,464 --> 00:20:45,392
And whether or not the affair
that Will and I had...

344
00:20:45,464 --> 00:20:48,115
should have any bearing on my assuming
office is for the committee to decide.

345
00:20:48,184 --> 00:20:52,919
I dare not assume that I have
the objective wisdom to make
that determination. Thank you.

346
00:20:52,984 --> 00:20:56,333
- Senator,
are you suggesting the public...
- Okay, she's had a long day.

347
00:20:56,408 --> 00:20:58,036
You know what she's going through.
Come on, come on.

348
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:59,664
You know what she's going through.
Come on, come on.

349
00:20:59,735 --> 00:21:01,743
She was your best friend.

350
00:21:01,816 --> 00:21:06,006
<i>Runyon deposed Will's
ex-wife today, and, uh...</i>

351
00:21:06,072 --> 00:21:08,439
she stated that Will and I
had had an affair...

352
00:21:08,504 --> 00:21:11,700
She saw her fucking holding hands,
interlocked fingers with this gal...

353
00:21:11,767 --> 00:21:13,622
and she knew
that she'd been fucking him.

354
00:21:13,687 --> 00:21:15,597
That's what she said.

355
00:21:15,672 --> 00:21:18,039
<i>- I'm sorry.
- It's a bad beat.</i>

356
00:21:18,104 --> 00:21:22,893
I'm not sure that I get
the point of all this.

357
00:21:22,967 --> 00:21:26,644
- You said under oath
that you never committed adultery.
- That's right.

358
00:21:26,711 --> 00:21:30,027
<i>- You perjured yourself.
- I didn't commit adultery.</i>

359
00:21:30,103 --> 00:21:31,794
- You were fucking Will
when he was married.
- All right.

360
00:21:31,863 --> 00:21:35,791
<i>Even the most loose definition
of committing adultery
would not include that.</i>

361
00:21:35,863 --> 00:21:38,230
Goddamn it, she's right.
You're right.

362
00:21:38,295 --> 00:21:41,873
<i>In order for it to be
committing adultery, she'd have
to be married at the time.</i>

363
00:21:41,943 --> 00:21:43,798
<i>You're nitpicking
in reverse now.</i>

364
00:21:43,863 --> 00:21:45,968
<i>Your husband may have been
an adulterer. You're not. Fine.</i>

365
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:50,709
What you are is a sex-crazed,
home-wrecking machine.
The female Warren Beatty.

366
00:21:50,775 --> 00:21:54,037
Runyon knows
that you're clean of the perjury...

367
00:21:54,103 --> 00:21:57,932
but he's got the world thinking you're
something out of a bad soap opera.

368
00:21:58,007 --> 00:22:02,764
You've goddamned crystallized
the difference between being
guilty and being responsible.

369
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:04,879
Are you asking me
to step down, sir?

370
00:22:04,951 --> 00:22:09,228
No, it's not gonna be
that easy for you, and it's not
gonna be that easy for them.

371
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:14,864
They caught you being
a human being. That's all.

372
00:22:16,983 --> 00:22:19,121
I'll die before Shelly Runyon
checkmates me.

373
00:22:19,191 --> 00:22:22,803
<i>I think the president's trying to say
the Sitting Bull routine isn't working.</i>

374
00:22:22,871 --> 00:22:26,166
- The Sitting Bull routine?
- No!

375
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:32,021
Fight back.

376
00:22:32,086 --> 00:22:36,080
Show them Laine Hanson isn't gonna take
their shit. Take the fight out of 'em.

377
00:22:36,151 --> 00:22:37,907
- What's the process?
- Confess.

378
00:22:37,975 --> 00:22:40,626
<i>- Confess?
- Yeah, confess.
- Confess.</i>

379
00:22:40,695 --> 00:22:43,182
Confess to the gang-bang.
Confess to all of it.

380
00:22:43,254 --> 00:22:46,767
<i>- Look what it did
for Clinton with Flowers.
- Play it any way you want.</i>

381
00:22:46,838 --> 00:22:48,627
It didn't hurt his numbers.
It improved his numbers.

382
00:22:48,695 --> 00:22:51,990
Show indignation about how a man
would never have to go through
hell for having done this.

383
00:22:52,054 --> 00:22:54,476
<i>Confess and demonstrate
to the young women of America...</i>

384
00:22:54,551 --> 00:22:59,733
<i>how such sexual impropriety
can ruin their lives.</i>

385
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:04,588
Confess and preach about the dangers
that alcohol can bring to you.

386
00:23:04,663 --> 00:23:06,735
For God's sakes, just confess!

387
00:23:06,806 --> 00:23:10,603
I understand, Kermit, truly.

388
00:23:12,118 --> 00:23:14,988
I understand, and you know what?
It's really nobody's business.

389
00:23:15,063 --> 00:23:18,740
<i>Well, it is
our fucking business!</i>

390
00:23:30,071 --> 00:23:31,925
Listen, Laine...

391
00:23:32,951 --> 00:23:35,536
I don't care who you fucked...

392
00:23:35,606 --> 00:23:38,803
and how many times
in how many positions...

393
00:23:38,871 --> 00:23:41,969
as long as it doesn't threaten
the administration.

394
00:23:44,502 --> 00:23:47,633
<i>You can be cavalier
on your own dime.</i>

395
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,965
Mr. President.

396
00:24:04,758 --> 00:24:10,387
I am fully prepared
to step down...

397
00:24:10,454 --> 00:24:13,268
but my personal life...

398
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:16,978
and my past...

399
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:20,206
are just that.

400
00:24:20,278 --> 00:24:23,922
But I will do
whatever you say.

401
00:24:27,574 --> 00:24:33,291
Show them why Laine Hanson is my nominee
with your closing statement.

402
00:24:33,366 --> 00:24:35,504
Mr. Chairman...

403
00:24:35,573 --> 00:24:38,770
ladies and gentlemen
of the committee:

404
00:24:38,838 --> 00:24:43,278
Uh, remarkably enough, it seems
that I have some explaining to do.

405
00:24:43,349 --> 00:24:47,059
So...
let me be absolutely clear.

406
00:24:53,653 --> 00:24:57,330
I stand for a woman's right
to choose.

407
00:24:57,397 --> 00:25:01,292
I stand for the elimination
of the death penalty.

408
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:04,268
I stand for a strong
and growing armed forces...

409
00:25:04,342 --> 00:25:08,171
because we must stomp out genocide
on this planet...

410
00:25:08,246 --> 00:25:11,759
and I believe that that
is a cause worth dying for.

411
00:25:13,238 --> 00:25:17,678
I stand for seeing every gun
taken out of every home. Period.

412
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:22,572
I stand for making
the selling of cigarettes
to our youth a federal offense.

413
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:27,599
I stand for term limits
and campaign reform.

414
00:25:27,669 --> 00:25:32,208
And, Mr. Chairman, I stand for
the separation of church and state...

415
00:25:32,277 --> 00:25:36,947
and the reason that I stand
for that is the same reason that
I believe our forefathers did.

416
00:25:37,013 --> 00:25:40,177
It is not there to protect religion
from the grasp of government...

417
00:25:40,245 --> 00:25:44,435
but to protect our government
from the grasp of religious fanaticism.

418
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:46,989
I may be an atheist...

419
00:25:47,061 --> 00:25:51,217
but that does not mean I do not
go to church; I do go to church.

420
00:25:51,285 --> 00:25:54,668
The church I go to is the one
that emancipated the slaves...

421
00:25:54,741 --> 00:25:57,108
that gave women
the right to vote.

422
00:25:57,173 --> 00:26:02,191
It gave us every freedom
that we hold dear.

423
00:26:02,261 --> 00:26:05,873
My church is this very chapel
of democracy that we sit in together...

424
00:26:05,941 --> 00:26:08,975
and I do not need God to tell me
what are my moral absolutes.

425
00:26:09,045 --> 00:26:11,249
I need my heart,
my brain and this church.

426
00:26:17,429 --> 00:26:19,468
Get in there, get in there.

427
00:26:20,981 --> 00:26:24,429
Oh, shoot!
Come on, come on, come on!

428
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:28,145
- Senator? Oh...
- Hello, Freshman.

429
00:26:28,213 --> 00:26:30,417
Senator, I just wanted
to steal a couple of seconds.

430
00:26:30,485 --> 00:26:33,518
What? See what whores do
on their time off?

431
00:26:36,853 --> 00:26:40,114
Listen,
I know the things I've done.

432
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:43,180
They may not have been nice
or considered politically savvy...

433
00:26:43,252 --> 00:26:47,181
but they have served the greater good
and they have been honest.

434
00:26:47,253 --> 00:26:48,943
Okay.

435
00:26:49,012 --> 00:26:51,533
Look, I know
you're not a whore.

436
00:26:51,605 --> 00:26:53,776
<i>- I'm not gonna talk about it.
- I know. You're not talking about it.</i>

437
00:26:56,117 --> 00:26:58,321
Somebody else
has come forward.

438
00:26:58,389 --> 00:27:01,520
Somebody else from the night
of the incident sent me this letter.

439
00:27:01,588 --> 00:27:03,443
<i>They didn't send it to me.
They sent it to the committee.</i>

440
00:27:03,508 --> 00:27:05,930
<i>I just happen to be in charge
of all the correspondence.</i>

441
00:27:06,005 --> 00:27:09,550
I don't think you can keep quiet
about what's in there.

442
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:13,843
Mr. Runyon has a copy,
and now so do you.

443
00:27:13,909 --> 00:27:17,040
<i>I beg you, Senator,
to deal with this.</i>

444
00:27:19,509 --> 00:27:22,062
- How long is this flight?
- About an hour and 40 minutes.

445
00:27:22,133 --> 00:27:26,126
POTUS is scheduled to address
the American Legion on the third.

446
00:27:26,196 --> 00:27:28,847
<i>- American Legion? Who approved that?
- I don't know.</i>

447
00:27:28,916 --> 00:27:31,436
- I thought he had
the D.A.R. Dinner that night.
- We have a five-hour window.

448
00:27:31,508 --> 00:27:33,199
- Hey, Chuck.
- Hey, Kermit.

449
00:27:33,268 --> 00:27:35,123
Did you get the AP reports?

450
00:27:35,188 --> 00:27:39,727
- What's that?
- POTUS's poll numbers are down 23%.

451
00:27:39,796 --> 00:27:43,506
- And Hanson's in the low 30s.
- Get in there.
I'll talk to you in a minute.

452
00:27:43,572 --> 00:27:46,354
- Are you Willomina?
- Yes, sir.

453
00:27:48,052 --> 00:27:49,907
You asked to see me?

454
00:27:49,972 --> 00:27:53,136
- Is this your handiwork?
- Yes, sir.

455
00:27:53,204 --> 00:27:57,132
- How many people have seen this?
- I gave it only to the director.

456
00:27:57,204 --> 00:28:00,783
- And who have you talked to about this?
- Nobody.

457
00:28:00,852 --> 00:28:03,502
Not a husband? Boyfriend?

458
00:28:03,572 --> 00:28:07,598
- Grandma in Kalamazoo?
- No, sir. Nobody.

459
00:28:07,668 --> 00:28:10,985
<i>- Keep it that way.
- Yes, sir.</i>

460
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:13,777
You did a good job,
Special Agent.

461
00:28:16,148 --> 00:28:21,778
Sir! Uh, sir, I just... I just wanted
to ask, ask you. Um, well...

462
00:28:21,844 --> 00:28:24,462
Are you gonna dump her?

463
00:28:24,532 --> 00:28:27,282
<i>Sir, this may be really,
really inappropriate...</i>

464
00:28:27,348 --> 00:28:29,901
but if that's what you guys
are thinking...

465
00:28:29,972 --> 00:28:33,452
<i>Please, you can't do it.
She's hope.</i>

466
00:28:33,524 --> 00:28:37,070
Hope that the standards...
That there is no double standard.

467
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:39,627
Hope that the goals
can be the same.

468
00:28:41,044 --> 00:28:43,826
You know what?
You're goddamn right.

469
00:28:44,852 --> 00:28:48,016
That was absolutely inappropriate.

470
00:28:48,084 --> 00:28:50,320
Robertson.

471
00:29:02,963 --> 00:29:05,419
<i>I wouldn't take it too hard.</i>

472
00:29:05,491 --> 00:29:07,499
<i>It's not exactly fair
when six foxes and one chicken...</i>

473
00:29:07,572 --> 00:29:10,222
<i>are voting on
what to have for dinner.</i>

474
00:29:10,291 --> 00:29:14,034
<i> Well, that's not
playing fair. I'll give you that.</i>

475
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,238
<i>You want an oatmeal cookie?</i>

476
00:29:16,307 --> 00:29:17,900
<i>- Trevor?
- I'm getting them, sir.</i>

477
00:29:17,971 --> 00:29:22,095
<i>I find these giant raisins...
Well, you'll see.</i>

478
00:29:22,163 --> 00:29:24,170
Taste like grapes.

479
00:29:30,355 --> 00:29:33,770
Shelly, you really made
a mess of things for me.

480
00:29:33,843 --> 00:29:36,080
You sure did clobber me.

481
00:29:39,283 --> 00:29:43,625
Isn't it possible, sir,
that I was... that I was acting...

482
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:45,936
<i>- in the best interests
of the United States?
- No.</i>

483
00:29:46,003 --> 00:29:48,337
It's not possible.

484
00:29:48,403 --> 00:29:51,665
That's what pisses me off. It's all
about retribution for Hartford.

485
00:29:51,731 --> 00:29:54,120
Thank you, Trevor.
That'll be all.

486
00:29:54,195 --> 00:29:58,123
- Go ahead. Try this. It's wonderful.
- No.

487
00:29:58,195 --> 00:30:02,385
I may have taken the presidency
from you, but you one-upped me.

488
00:30:02,451 --> 00:30:05,386
You took away my legacy.

489
00:30:05,459 --> 00:30:08,655
I look at her and I see someone who
has proven the capacity for disloyalty.

490
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:10,633
Or the capacity
for seeing the light.

491
00:30:12,627 --> 00:30:14,699
We're both sticking
to our guns.

492
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:17,706
The difference is...
mine are loaded.

493
00:30:17,779 --> 00:30:22,863
<i>Look, it doesn't matter, does it?
She's not being confirmed.</i>

494
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:26,891
We can talk for days
about greatness and leadership...

495
00:30:26,963 --> 00:30:29,385
<i>but Laine Hanson
will not be confirmed.</i>

496
00:30:29,459 --> 00:30:32,720
I have seven from your side
who are giving her the ax.

497
00:30:32,786 --> 00:30:34,674
Oh, indeed, the ax?

498
00:30:34,739 --> 00:30:36,594
<i>We can go through
the process of a vote.</i>

499
00:30:36,659 --> 00:30:38,186
<i>You can waste time...</i>

500
00:30:38,259 --> 00:30:42,830
and suffer the humiliation,
or... or we can just move on.

501
00:30:42,898 --> 00:30:44,873
<i>- There's a lot of good folk
to choose from.
- Who?</i>

502
00:30:44,947 --> 00:30:47,118
Who can I be certain
you'll confirm?

503
00:30:47,186 --> 00:30:51,147
The man you wanted in the first place:
Jack Hathaway.

504
00:30:53,267 --> 00:30:55,121
Shelly.

505
00:30:56,659 --> 00:30:58,546
<i>Good man.</i>

506
00:31:08,883 --> 00:31:11,817
Okay, Shelly...

507
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:16,712
I'll give you Governor Jack Hathaway,
but I wanna make damn sure...

508
00:31:16,787 --> 00:31:20,016
<i>- you'll give him a smooth ride.
- My word. There's a reason
they call me Honest Shell.</i>

509
00:31:20,082 --> 00:31:23,857
Irony, Shelly.
I want an insurance policy.

510
00:31:23,922 --> 00:31:26,704
I want a piece of the rock.
I wanna make sure...

511
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:28,974
<i>you're not gonna pull
some kind of baloney out of your hat...</i>

512
00:31:29,042 --> 00:31:31,214
<i>and make a mockery
of my administration again.</i>

513
00:31:31,283 --> 00:31:33,672
<i>Listen. This is
what I'm gonna do.</i>

514
00:31:35,954 --> 00:31:40,362
I'm gonna ask Mrs. Hanson and
Mr. Hathaway up to the Oval Office...

515
00:31:40,434 --> 00:31:42,921
before the D.A.R. Banquet
tomorrow night.

516
00:31:42,994 --> 00:31:45,099
<i>I want you there as well,
but, Shelly...</i>

517
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:49,032
before then, I need you
to marry yourself to this guy.

518
00:31:49,106 --> 00:31:53,230
<i>I need you to make a public statement
that makes his sinking your sinking.</i>

519
00:31:53,298 --> 00:31:55,753
<i>- Otherwise...
- But I'm not sure I can...</i>

520
00:31:55,826 --> 00:31:59,055
Let's make this confirmation
fast and furious.

521
00:31:59,122 --> 00:32:01,872
- Help me save face on this one.
- Okay.

522
00:32:15,282 --> 00:32:19,144
<i>Oh, man. Mr. Runyon,
prefer I take you around back?</i>

523
00:32:19,218 --> 00:32:22,993
<i>- No, I'll be fine.
- Yes, sir.</i>

524
00:32:33,202 --> 00:32:38,188
How do you respond to the rumors
that Mrs. Hanson has withdrawn her name?

525
00:32:38,258 --> 00:32:40,167
That is a rumor
I've not yet heard.

526
00:32:40,242 --> 00:32:42,544
Have you heard about the possibility
of Governor Hathaway...

527
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:46,090
- returning to the list
of vice presidential...
- Governor Hathaway is a fine man.

528
00:32:46,162 --> 00:32:48,399
<i>Will he have a smoother ride
than Mrs. Hanson?</i>

529
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:50,887
Let me go on record
as saying...

530
00:32:50,962 --> 00:32:54,508
that in my opinion there is
no man alive... no Democrat alive...

531
00:32:54,578 --> 00:32:57,295
who could bring...

532
00:32:57,362 --> 00:33:01,006
more integrity
to the office of the vice presidency.

533
00:33:01,073 --> 00:33:04,389
I would stake my career...

534
00:33:04,465 --> 00:33:08,938
on Governor Hathaway's, uh,
smooth and efficient confirmation.

535
00:33:09,009 --> 00:33:11,824
<i>As for Laine Hanson...</i>

536
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:15,337
<i>- Got everybody, Glenda?
- Yes, sir. He says you can
go in whenever you're ready.</i>

537
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,548
- Great. Hello, Jack.
- Kermit.

538
00:33:17,617 --> 00:33:21,327
- Fiona, you're looking
particularly fetching this evening.
- Thank you, sir.

539
00:33:21,393 --> 00:33:24,808
- I believe this is the first one
of these affairs for you, right?
- Yes.

540
00:33:24,881 --> 00:33:27,434
- My 37th.
- You look great.

541
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:30,188
- Hello, Shelly.
- Newman.

542
00:33:30,257 --> 00:33:34,797
Everybody would understand if you
wanted to delay for two weeks.

543
00:33:34,866 --> 00:33:38,062
I'm not sure I could stomach
another two weeks.

544
00:33:39,089 --> 00:33:42,024
Oh, Jack.

545
00:33:42,098 --> 00:33:45,643
- Jerry. Good.
- How are you?

546
00:33:45,713 --> 00:33:47,688
Mr. Hanson.

547
00:33:48,881 --> 00:33:51,750
<i>- Gentlemen. Jack.
- Mr. President.</i>

548
00:33:51,825 --> 00:33:53,865
There he is! Shelly!

549
00:33:53,937 --> 00:33:56,042
Hello, Mr. President.

550
00:33:56,113 --> 00:33:58,055
Uh, you know what?

551
00:33:58,129 --> 00:34:00,617
Before we get started...

552
00:34:00,689 --> 00:34:02,991
I can't stomach the idea...

553
00:34:03,057 --> 00:34:05,927
of touching that chichi food we always
get served at these state dinners.

554
00:34:06,001 --> 00:34:07,855
<i>- Glenda?
- Yes, sir?</i>

555
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:10,888
<i>Could we put together a grilled
cheese sandwich? Muenster on rye.</i>

556
00:34:10,961 --> 00:34:12,935
<i>Right away.</i>

557
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:15,213
Oh, sorry. Where are my manners?
You guys want anything?

558
00:34:15,281 --> 00:34:17,867
- No, thank you, sir.
- Shelly?

559
00:34:17,937 --> 00:34:19,944
<i>Jesus, uh, Shell,
those were some...</i>

560
00:34:20,017 --> 00:34:23,465
very nice things
you said about Jack.

561
00:34:25,361 --> 00:34:29,289
Jack, there. I understand
that you two have never met.

562
00:34:29,361 --> 00:34:31,979
<i>- Laine Hanson, Jack Hathaway.
- It's a pleasure.</i>

563
00:34:32,049 --> 00:34:33,904
- I'm quite in awe of you.
- Thank you.

564
00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:37,994
<i>Mr. President?</i>

565
00:34:38,065 --> 00:34:42,407
<i>- Yes, Glenda?
- Sir, the kitchen's
all out of Muenster.</i>

566
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,506
Really? Wow.
Well, um, let's get on that.

567
00:34:46,576 --> 00:34:49,838
<i>We don't want the wheels
coming off the wagon.</i>

568
00:34:57,488 --> 00:35:01,034
This is, uh...

569
00:35:01,105 --> 00:35:05,676
This is quite an event.
Here we are. Quite a sad event.

570
00:35:05,745 --> 00:35:07,654
- Mr. President, if I may?
- Yes, please.

571
00:35:07,729 --> 00:35:11,373
A short while ago,
you told me that you thought
I might be the future of the party.

572
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,407
<i>I know that these
are tough times...</i>

573
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,335
and the future is uncertain...

574
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,946
but I'm very pleased to think
that I might be able to help
make things a little smoother.

575
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:26,182
The future, yes.
Well, there is one thing...

576
00:35:26,256 --> 00:35:29,868
quite certain
about the future.

577
00:35:31,377 --> 00:35:34,060
- What's that?
- Sir?

578
00:35:34,128 --> 00:35:36,430
- You have the right to remain silent...
- Fred.

579
00:35:36,496 --> 00:35:40,719
- I have to read him his rights.
- Fred, the governor,
he knows his rights.

580
00:35:40,785 --> 00:35:44,582
You know your rights, right, Jack?
You don't have to humiliate him.

581
00:35:44,656 --> 00:35:47,023
You fucked up, buddy.

582
00:35:47,088 --> 00:35:51,212
<i>- The girl, do you know what she was?
- What girl?</i>

583
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,215
- The girl in the river.
- She was a paralegal.

584
00:35:54,288 --> 00:35:57,583
- Before that.
- She was military. Fourteen Golf.

585
00:35:57,648 --> 00:36:01,926
<i>We found the money that you put
in her account at the Bellagio.</i>

586
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,034
- Two hundred thousand dollars.
- And that ad in...

587
00:36:05,104 --> 00:36:07,438
<i>- Soldier of Fortune.
- Yeah, Soldier of Fortune.</i>

588
00:36:07,504 --> 00:36:09,839
I don't mind confessing,
I am at a total fucking loss.

589
00:36:09,904 --> 00:36:13,995
Shelly, he paid her
to go off the fucking bridge.

590
00:36:14,064 --> 00:36:17,293
<i>He paid her to save her.</i>

591
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,215
Jesus Christ.

592
00:36:21,328 --> 00:36:24,143
- Shelly, maybe I...
- You shouldn't say anything.

593
00:36:24,208 --> 00:36:28,812
<i>- Jack, look, we respect...
- You're going to have
to come with me now.</i>

594
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,051
Fred. We respect you.

595
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,989
We're trying to make this go
as smoothly as it possibly can.

596
00:36:34,064 --> 00:36:36,202
I know you meant no harm.

597
00:36:36,271 --> 00:36:39,468
- Hell, I don't even know...
What would the charge be?
- Negligent homicide.

598
00:36:39,536 --> 00:36:43,791
Oh, negligent homicide.

599
00:36:43,856 --> 00:36:45,765
Sir.

600
00:36:47,216 --> 00:36:49,583
- Good luck, Mrs. Hanson.
- You too.

601
00:36:49,648 --> 00:36:52,779
Who doesn't want
a shortcut to greatness?

602
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:10,535
Oh, it's a goddamn shame
about the Muenster.

603
00:37:20,816 --> 00:37:22,670
Mr. President.

604
00:37:22,736 --> 00:37:24,907
<i>Yeah, Shelly?</i>

605
00:37:24,975 --> 00:37:27,047
You set me up.

606
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,974
Just this once.

607
00:37:32,944 --> 00:37:35,213
For the record, sir...

608
00:37:35,279 --> 00:37:39,370
I find what you did
to be manipulative...

609
00:37:39,439 --> 00:37:42,473
Mr. Chairman, let's just say...

610
00:37:42,544 --> 00:37:45,577
"I'm guilty
but not responsible," hmm?

611
00:37:46,896 --> 00:37:51,500
<i>Shelly, you needn't worry
about us exposing the fact...</i>

612
00:37:51,567 --> 00:37:53,989
<i>that you leaked all that horrible
material about Laine on the Internet.</i>

613
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:58,733
We know that you were
just following your heart.

614
00:37:59,727 --> 00:38:01,767
Yeah, Hartford,
it was a tough one.

615
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:03,912
But... Well, it doesn't
make a difference.

616
00:38:03,983 --> 00:38:07,660
- She still is who she is.
- Yes, she is.

617
00:38:07,727 --> 00:38:10,094
<i>And you are who you are.</i>

618
00:38:12,527 --> 00:38:14,501
You're still coming
to the banquet, aren't you?

619
00:38:14,575 --> 00:38:17,292
Because I'd love to see you.
Is your wife in town?

620
00:38:21,167 --> 00:38:24,134
May I introduce
tonight's honoree, Miss Barr?

621
00:38:24,207 --> 00:38:26,956
- Congressman Webster.
- Honor, madam.

622
00:38:27,023 --> 00:38:30,186
And, Congressman,
you know the senator, of course.

623
00:38:30,254 --> 00:38:32,807
We go about two feet back.

624
00:38:32,878 --> 00:38:35,912
I asked them to have you seated
at my table tonight.

625
00:38:35,983 --> 00:38:39,877
- If you want to break bread with me.
- Absolutely.

626
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:42,568
- Don't eat all the hors d'oeuvres.
- Shark steak sandwiches?

627
00:38:42,638 --> 00:38:44,711
Yeah. Save me some.

628
00:38:47,759 --> 00:38:51,785
Last time I shared one of these,
it was with the president of Russia.

629
00:38:51,855 --> 00:38:56,841
Or maybe it was the kid
who won Wimbledon for the second time.

630
00:38:56,911 --> 00:38:58,853
I'm honored, sir.

631
00:39:01,007 --> 00:39:03,974
You're not supposed to inhale.

632
00:39:04,047 --> 00:39:07,178
Maybe that's the first thing
you should've told me.

633
00:39:09,262 --> 00:39:11,880
Recognize this affidavit?

634
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:13,892
Where'd you get that, sir?

635
00:39:13,966 --> 00:39:16,388
Where you got yours.

636
00:39:16,463 --> 00:39:19,180
Where Shelly Runyon got his.

637
00:39:19,247 --> 00:39:21,800
From Mr. Webster.

638
00:39:23,022 --> 00:39:25,478
He may not know
his right from his left...

639
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:28,452
but apparently
he does know right from wrong.

640
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:32,139
I understand you
even less now, Senator.

641
00:39:32,206 --> 00:39:35,435
- You are an enigma wrapped in a riddle.
- Wrapped in a riddle.

642
00:39:35,502 --> 00:39:38,634
Watch your step, Senator.

643
00:39:43,118 --> 00:39:46,860
What if I told you that I'm just
busting at the seams...

644
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:50,538
to know what exactly
happened that night...

645
00:39:50,606 --> 00:39:54,086
to hear the truth
from your own lips?

646
00:39:54,158 --> 00:39:57,257
Totally off the record.

647
00:39:57,326 --> 00:40:02,596
Not between the president
and the senator, but between
the president and Laine.

648
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:06,248
Better than that.
Between Jackson and Laine.

649
00:40:17,742 --> 00:40:22,019
Well, I had just turned 18
when I got to college...

650
00:40:22,094 --> 00:40:25,061
and I had never been
away from home, not really.

651
00:40:25,134 --> 00:40:30,535
And I was immediately...
I was immediately lonely.

652
00:40:30,605 --> 00:40:34,118
And that's when
the sorority kicked in.

653
00:40:34,189 --> 00:40:36,131
I wanted them,
they wanted me.

654
00:40:36,206 --> 00:40:38,377
I was the daughter of the governor,
for chrissake.

655
00:40:38,446 --> 00:40:41,609
- True blue catch.
- I guess so.

656
00:40:41,677 --> 00:40:46,380
And like any other sorority,
they have an initiation, a rush.

657
00:40:46,446 --> 00:40:51,497
And they have this girl, this woman
that Runyon deposed, Patty LaVamere.

658
00:40:51,566 --> 00:40:53,770
She runs the sorority,
and she gives it to me straight:

659
00:40:53,838 --> 00:40:59,501
If I wanna be in, I have to go to
their brother fraternity and have sex...

660
00:40:59,565 --> 00:41:02,435
with two boys.

661
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:04,484
What a coup for them, huh?

662
00:41:04,557 --> 00:41:08,070
Daughter of a big-time Republican
doing a frat house?

663
00:41:08,142 --> 00:41:10,989
But I say,
"There's no chance."

664
00:41:11,054 --> 00:41:13,836
- The whole thing was pretty hairy.
- I bet.

665
00:41:13,902 --> 00:41:16,869
But six beers later,
I'm talking a different tune...

666
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:19,527
so off we go
to the frat house.

667
00:41:19,598 --> 00:41:22,053
Half the girls were there,
about a zillion boys.

668
00:41:22,126 --> 00:41:26,730
They're cheering my name.
"Laine! Laine! Laine!"

669
00:41:26,797 --> 00:41:30,180
And I'm just stumbling around.

670
00:41:32,269 --> 00:41:36,328
Eventually I just say,
"I'm gonna go for it."

671
00:41:36,397 --> 00:41:40,740
If getting laid is a common initiation
for boys in the frat...

672
00:41:40,813 --> 00:41:43,781
then why not for us, right?

673
00:41:43,854 --> 00:41:47,814
- You're asking me?
- No, I'm not.

674
00:41:47,885 --> 00:41:51,049
Oh, sorry.
Sorry. Go ahead.

675
00:41:51,117 --> 00:41:53,288
That's okay.

676
00:41:54,701 --> 00:41:57,156
So they send me
into this room.

677
00:41:57,229 --> 00:42:00,426
It's dark and dim.
There are these two guys.

678
00:42:00,493 --> 00:42:03,908
They both have towels
wrapped around their waists.

679
00:42:03,981 --> 00:42:08,999
And the first guy,
he slips his towel off.

680
00:42:09,069 --> 00:42:12,746
And I see his thing, and...

681
00:42:12,813 --> 00:42:15,912
I take it in my hand...

682
00:42:15,981 --> 00:42:18,883
and I say...

683
00:42:20,493 --> 00:42:25,250
- It was the first thing
that came into my head.
- What did you say?

684
00:42:25,325 --> 00:42:27,659
I said,
"I'm sorry, I don't smoke."

685
00:42:30,733 --> 00:42:33,799
And then I just got
the hell out of there.

686
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:37,515
You okay, sir?

687
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:42,599
Oh, no, I'm just thinking what I'd pay
to be back in college again.

688
00:42:45,421 --> 00:42:49,643
The next day, the campus
was rampant with word...

689
00:42:49,708 --> 00:42:51,650
that I had been
the center of a gang-bang.

690
00:42:51,724 --> 00:42:53,732
I mean, the governor's daughter.

691
00:42:53,804 --> 00:42:56,936
Let me tell you.
That's one hell of a bell to un-ring.

692
00:42:57,005 --> 00:42:59,655
- What about the photographs?
- Not me.

693
00:42:59,725 --> 00:43:02,146
I never took my clothes off.

694
00:43:02,221 --> 00:43:05,287
Even if I had, I've got
this big birthmark on my right thigh...

695
00:43:05,357 --> 00:43:08,074
that the lady with the lovely physique
in the photo lacks.

696
00:43:08,141 --> 00:43:12,297
- No witnesses?
- Pure urban legend.

697
00:43:12,365 --> 00:43:15,398
A little bit of wishful thinking
thrown in, I think.

698
00:43:16,205 --> 00:43:18,758
You know, Laine...

699
00:43:18,828 --> 00:43:22,985
you could've looked those pricks
in the eye and told them the truth.

700
00:43:23,052 --> 00:43:25,441
Under oath. Told them
they were full of shit.

701
00:43:25,517 --> 00:43:29,673
And barring that,
you could've at least told me.

702
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:34,475
But see, it really wasn't any of your
business either, and it still isn't.

703
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:37,889
There's something about
almost puking on a Havana...

704
00:43:37,964 --> 00:43:40,233
that just turns a girl...
to blush.

705
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:44,457
This letter from Jack Bennet...

706
00:43:44,524 --> 00:43:49,542
and Larry Bellows, affidavit, I guess,
that you got from Webster.

707
00:43:49,612 --> 00:43:52,646
It pretty much says
that nothing happened that night.

708
00:43:52,716 --> 00:43:56,709
- They're ready
to come forward to be deposed.
- That's very good of them.

709
00:43:56,780 --> 00:44:00,195
So, that's it. The end.
Good guys win.

710
00:44:00,268 --> 00:44:03,432
I'm gonna call a press conference
tomorrow, read that letter...

711
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:07,973
and damn it if you don't have
the fastest confirmation on record.

712
00:44:08,044 --> 00:44:09,899
No, sir.

713
00:44:09,964 --> 00:44:12,452
"No, sir"?
What, "No, sir"?

714
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:17,030
I would prefer that we not
have the press conference, sir.

715
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:20,329
Laine, maybe you've been out
of law school too long.

716
00:44:20,396 --> 00:44:23,429
- This is what they call
exculpatory evidence.
- Yes, I realize that.

717
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:27,242
- This is your ticket to wherever
history is gonna take you.
- Yes.

718
00:44:27,308 --> 00:44:30,886
But principles only mean
something if you stick by them
when they're inconvenient.

719
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:35,210
If I ever did
answer the questions...

720
00:44:35,276 --> 00:44:38,821
you know,
even to exonerate myself...

721
00:44:38,891 --> 00:44:42,372
that would mean that it was
okay for them to have been
asked in the first place...

722
00:44:42,444 --> 00:44:44,298
and it isn't.

723
00:44:44,364 --> 00:44:46,982
- You would sacrifice your reputation?
- Yes, I would.

724
00:44:47,052 --> 00:44:50,434
People have sacrificed
a lot more for a lot less.

725
00:44:52,491 --> 00:44:56,550
- We've got him! We have Goliath.
- Sir, are you all right, sir?

726
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:59,936
- It's okay, guys. Busted.
- POTUS is secure.

727
00:45:00,267 --> 00:45:03,431
<i>Of course, the president addressing
a joint session of Congress...</i>

728
00:45:03,499 --> 00:45:05,834
<i>is always unusual,
always an event.</i>

729
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:08,682
<i>This speech is scheduled
to begin momentarily.</i>

730
00:45:08,747 --> 00:45:12,009
<i>We understand the president
has arrived at the U.S. Capitol.</i>

731
00:45:12,076 --> 00:45:15,425
I don't care if I never
see any of these guys again.

732
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:19,755
<i> Sources in the White House
have told us that the president...</i>

733
00:45:19,819 --> 00:45:23,299
<i>- It's gonna be okay.
- Does intend to withdraw the name
of Senator Laine B. Hanson...</i>

734
00:45:23,371 --> 00:45:28,074
I still have a year and a half on
my term. That's a long time to recover.

735
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:33,377
<i>- Then there's always...
- Given the stunning charges
made against Governor Hathaway...</i>

736
00:45:33,452 --> 00:45:37,445
<i>- Laine, honey, it's gonna be fine.
- Those on the inside are suggesting...</i>

737
00:45:37,515 --> 00:45:39,403
<i>- It's gonna be okay.
- The president will designate...</i>

738
00:45:39,467 --> 00:45:42,598
<i>- Ambassador Francis J. Malloy
as his number two.
- Yeah, thanks.</i>

739
00:45:43,947 --> 00:45:46,086
Pace me at five to ten, okay?

740
00:45:49,195 --> 00:45:53,832
<i>... after the greeting
of the president of the United States.</i>

741
00:45:53,899 --> 00:45:57,576
<i>Mr. Speaker, the president
of the United States of America.</i>

742
00:47:09,899 --> 00:47:12,266
<i>Thank you.</i>

743
00:47:14,570 --> 00:47:19,688
Napoleon once said,
when asked to explain the lack
of great statesmen in the world...

744
00:47:19,755 --> 00:47:22,144
that, "to get power...

745
00:47:22,219 --> 00:47:25,568
you need to display
absolute pettiness.

746
00:47:25,642 --> 00:47:29,571
To exercise power,
you need to show true greatness."

747
00:47:29,642 --> 00:47:34,018
<i>Such pettiness and such greatness
are rarely found in one person.</i>

748
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:37,386
<i>I look upon the events
of the past weeks...</i>

749
00:47:37,450 --> 00:47:41,094
<i>and I've never come so to grips
with that quotation.</i>

750
00:47:41,162 --> 00:47:43,399
So, ladies and gentlemen
of this Congress...

751
00:47:43,466 --> 00:47:48,649
it pains my soul to tell you
that you have brought blood
and shame under this great dome.

752
00:47:48,714 --> 00:47:52,991
Your leadership has raised
the stakes of hate to a level...

753
00:47:53,066 --> 00:47:57,441
where we can no longer separate
the demagogue from the truly inspired.

754
00:47:57,514 --> 00:48:02,631
And believe this,
there are traitors among us.

755
00:48:02,698 --> 00:48:07,106
<i>And I'm not talking about those of you
who sided against your party leadership.</i>

756
00:48:07,178 --> 00:48:10,975
<i>I'm talking about those of you
who were patriots to your party...</i>

757
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:14,530
but traitors
to the necessary end result:

758
00:48:14,602 --> 00:48:17,701
<i>That of righteousness,
the truth...</i>

759
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:22,887
the concept of making
the American dream blind to gender.

760
00:48:22,954 --> 00:48:27,177
<i>And you know,
I am not free of blame.</i>

761
00:48:27,242 --> 00:48:29,544
Right from the start
I should've come down here...

762
00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:32,709
pointed a finger your way...

763
00:48:32,778 --> 00:48:34,785
<i>pointed a finger your way...</i>

764
00:48:34,858 --> 00:48:38,240
<i>and asked you,
"Have you no decency, sir?"</i>

765
00:48:40,010 --> 00:48:42,977
<i>Yesterday...</i>

766
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:45,286
I met...

767
00:48:45,353 --> 00:48:48,037
<i>Mr. Runyon...</i>

768
00:48:48,106 --> 00:48:51,073
you may walk out on me,
you may walk out on this body...

769
00:48:51,146 --> 00:48:55,783
but you cannot walk out
on the will of the American people.

770
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:58,719
<i>Americans are a good people,
they're a just people, Mr. Runyon...</i>

771
00:48:58,793 --> 00:49:02,405
and they will forgive you,
but they will not forget.

772
00:49:02,474 --> 00:49:04,994
Hate and ego
have no place residing...

773
00:49:05,065 --> 00:49:09,538
in what my good friend Laine Hanson
calls the chapel of democracy.

774
00:49:09,609 --> 00:49:11,431
<i>So, let me make one thing clear.</i>

775
00:49:11,498 --> 00:49:15,840
<i>You come at us with whatever weapons
that you have in your arsenal...</i>

776
00:49:15,914 --> 00:49:18,565
but there is
no weapon as powerful...

777
00:49:18,634 --> 00:49:22,049
as that of an idea
whose time has come.

778
00:49:22,122 --> 00:49:26,050
A woman will serve in the highest level
of the Executive. Simple as that.

779
00:49:26,122 --> 00:49:29,286
<i>Yesterday...</i>

780
00:49:29,354 --> 00:49:32,769
I spoke with Laine Hanson.

781
00:49:32,842 --> 00:49:36,038
I told her that she could decide
her own destiny.

782
00:49:36,105 --> 00:49:38,953
If she wanted to continue
her fight for confirmation...

783
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:42,563
that I would stand beside her.

784
00:49:42,634 --> 00:49:45,383
She has asked me
to allow her to step aside.

785
00:49:45,449 --> 00:49:49,922
<i>She told me that she wanted
my administration to end on a note...</i>

786
00:49:49,993 --> 00:49:53,539
of triumph
and not controversy.

787
00:49:53,610 --> 00:49:58,912
Understand, those of you who worked
to bring Laine Hanson down...

788
00:49:58,985 --> 00:50:02,465
that she asked to have her name
withdrawn from consideration...

789
00:50:02,537 --> 00:50:06,247
not because she isn't great,
but because she isn't petty.

790
00:50:06,313 --> 00:50:09,761
<i>Because those two
conflicting leadership traits...</i>

791
00:50:09,833 --> 00:50:13,411
<i>could not live as one
within her body or her soul.</i>

792
00:50:13,481 --> 00:50:16,797
Greatness.
It comes in many forms.

793
00:50:16,873 --> 00:50:20,615
Sometimes it comes in the form
of sacrifice. That's the loneliest form.

794
00:50:20,681 --> 00:50:24,904
<i>Now, it turns out
that Laine Hanson is a woman...</i>

795
00:50:24,969 --> 00:50:28,318
an American
of devout principle...

796
00:50:28,393 --> 00:50:31,295
<i>and she has inspired me
to act alike...</i>

797
00:50:31,369 --> 00:50:36,387
and I cannot accept
Senator Hanson's withdrawal.

798
00:50:36,457 --> 00:50:41,509
<i>And I'm now calling for an immediate
vote of confirmation of Laine Hanson.</i>

799
00:50:41,577 --> 00:50:43,464
And, Mr. Speaker...

800
00:50:43,529 --> 00:50:47,839
I would like to make this
a live roll call.

801
00:50:47,913 --> 00:50:50,596
I want to see the faces
of those of you...

802
00:50:50,664 --> 00:50:53,698
who would eliminate the possibility
of greatness in American leadership...

803
00:50:53,769 --> 00:50:57,827
because of half-truths,
lies and innuendoes.

804
00:50:57,897 --> 00:51:00,799
I will not be deterred
by partisanship.

805
00:51:00,872 --> 00:51:02,727
I will not be deterred
by misogyny.

806
00:51:02,792 --> 00:51:05,181
<i>I will not be deterred
by hate.</i>

807
00:51:05,257 --> 00:51:08,291
You have now come face-to-face
with my will.

808
00:51:09,321 --> 00:51:12,452
<i>Confirm my nominee,
heal this nation...</i>

809
00:51:12,521 --> 00:51:16,482
and let the American people
explode into this new millennium...

810
00:51:16,553 --> 00:51:21,539
with the exhilaration of being true
to the glory of this democracy.

811
00:51:21,609 --> 00:51:23,299
Thank you.

812
00:52:07,368 --> 00:52:10,237
How's that for a swan song?

813
00:52:10,312 --> 00:52:12,614
You're back, Laine.

814
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:15,582
Yeah, I know.

815
00:52:16,582 --> 00:52:26,582
