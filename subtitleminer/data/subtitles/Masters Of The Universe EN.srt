<i>At the center of the universe...</i>

2
00:00:41,925 --> 00:00:44,393
<i>...at the border between
the light and the dark...</i>

3
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,429
<i>...stands Castle Greyskull.</i>

4
00:00:47,197 --> 00:00:49,688
<i>For countless ages
the Sorceress of Greyskull...</i>

5
00:00:49,766 --> 00:00:52,200
<i>...has kept this universe in harmony...</i>

6
00:00:52,535 --> 00:00:55,095
<i>...but the armies of darkness do not rest...</i>

7
00:00:55,271 --> 00:00:58,707
<i>...and the capture of Greyskull
is ever most in their minds.</i>

8
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:02,904
<i>For to those that control Greyskull
will come the power...</i>

9
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:05,375
<i>...the power to be supreme...</i>

10
00:01:05,448 --> 00:01:07,416
<i>...the power to be almighty...</i>

11
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,008
<i>...the power to be...</i>

12
00:01:09,252 --> 00:01:11,846
<i>...masters of the universe.</i>

13
00:03:09,138 --> 00:03:11,072
Report, Evil-Lyn. Speak!

14
00:03:11,307 --> 00:03:13,366
We have sealed the gates to the city.

15
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:17,504
The castle is secure and we are closing in
on the Thenurian as we speak.

16
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:20,811
- Yes! Yes! And He-Man?
- He continues to lead the resistance.

17
00:03:20,884 --> 00:03:24,251
I assure you,
we will have him before the day is out.

18
00:03:25,521 --> 00:03:29,355
I want him kneeling at my feet.

19
00:03:30,493 --> 00:03:33,189
After all this time...

20
00:03:33,496 --> 00:03:35,828
...Greyskull is ours.

21
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:37,223
No!

22
00:03:43,873 --> 00:03:45,397
Mine.

23
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:55,384
Someone is speaking to me.

24
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,452
Yes...

25
00:03:59,422 --> 00:04:00,912
...Sorceress.

26
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,753
My lovely prisoner.

27
00:04:03,126 --> 00:04:05,390
My prisoner at last.

28
00:04:07,797 --> 00:04:08,786
I've won!

29
00:04:09,933 --> 00:04:10,991
I've won.

30
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:15,570
The darkness is rising to embrace you.

31
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:19,604
The dark can embrace the light,
but never eclipse it.

32
00:04:20,143 --> 00:04:22,111
You have not won yet, Skeletor.

33
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:23,770
He-Man is still alive.

34
00:04:23,913 --> 00:04:25,676
- I can feel it!
- Really?

35
00:04:26,549 --> 00:04:28,414
How sensitive you are.

36
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:30,579
Can you feel...

37
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,809
...this!

38
00:04:42,665 --> 00:04:45,156
Evil-Lyn, activate the holosphere.

39
00:04:48,771 --> 00:04:50,261
People of Eternia...

40
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,040
...the war is over.

41
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:55,905
<i>My forces are victorious.</i>

42
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:59,646
<i>The Sorceress of Greyskull is my prisoner...</i>

43
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:03,079
<i>...and her powers
are now joined with mine.</i>

44
00:05:03,686 --> 00:05:06,678
<i>Let this be my first decree:</i>

45
00:05:07,123 --> 00:05:10,854
<i>Those who do not
pledge themselves to me...</i>

46
00:05:11,094 --> 00:05:14,257
<i>...shall be destroyed.</i>

47
00:05:14,697 --> 00:05:17,530
<i>The new age begins.</i>

48
00:06:23,066 --> 00:06:25,227
He-Man! Thank the Sorceress you're alive!

49
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:26,529
I've been looking for you!

50
00:06:34,444 --> 00:06:35,604
Greyskull...

51
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:36,972
It was terrible.

52
00:06:37,046 --> 00:06:38,513
How many units are left?

53
00:06:38,581 --> 00:06:39,605
Not many.

54
00:06:39,849 --> 00:06:41,578
All of us were scattered.

55
00:06:41,784 --> 00:06:44,150
Suddenly, they were everywhere.

56
00:06:44,587 --> 00:06:45,485
Chaos.

57
00:06:45,555 --> 00:06:46,749
Someone betrayed us.

58
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:47,915
Help!

59
00:06:48,124 --> 00:06:49,113
Help!

60
00:06:49,258 --> 00:06:51,123
- Get me out of this!
- It's all right.

61
00:06:52,762 --> 00:06:56,528
Help! Somebody!

62
00:06:56,732 --> 00:06:59,257
- Help!
- All right, we heard you.

63
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:01,428
- Pull the pole out.
- Careful!

64
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,597
- Thank the Sorceress.
- Here you come.

65
00:07:08,377 --> 00:07:09,537
Who are you?

66
00:07:10,746 --> 00:07:12,907
I am Gwildor of Thenur...

67
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:14,976
...locksmith and inventor.

68
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:18,180
Skeletor's forces were hunting me down.

69
00:07:18,254 --> 00:07:20,779
A million blessings upon you
for saving my life.

70
00:07:21,257 --> 00:07:24,590
No blessing is necessary.
Any foe of Skeletor is a friend of ours.

71
00:07:25,561 --> 00:07:27,688
Now, why are you so important
to Skeletor?

72
00:07:29,632 --> 00:07:30,621
Help me.

73
00:07:35,004 --> 00:07:36,232
I'd better show you.

74
00:07:36,305 --> 00:07:37,829
Please, come with me.

75
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,713
I remember the days
we didn't have to lock our doors.

76
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:51,081
Those days will come back. Oh, yes.

77
00:07:59,095 --> 00:08:01,427
Enter, enter.

78
00:08:02,598 --> 00:08:03,895
Come in. Come in.

79
00:08:03,966 --> 00:08:05,695
Welcome to my home.

80
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,362
Come on.

81
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:25,747
Now, you ask...

82
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,083
...why Skeletor asks for me:

83
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,555
Because of my invention.

84
00:08:32,628 --> 00:08:34,789
Because of this.

85
00:08:37,633 --> 00:08:39,498
Now I wish I hadn't created it.

86
00:08:39,569 --> 00:08:42,936
Skeletor wants me killed
so I can't make another one.

87
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:46,597
If he knew I had this prototype...

88
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:48,402
What is it?

89
00:08:48,678 --> 00:08:50,043
What does it do?

90
00:08:52,315 --> 00:08:53,680
I call it...

91
00:08:54,517 --> 00:08:56,451
...the "Cosmic Key."

92
00:09:01,023 --> 00:09:03,856
It is the most unique key in the universe.

93
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,424
The tones it generates...

94
00:09:06,562 --> 00:09:09,463
...can open a doorway to anywhere.

95
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:10,663
Anywhere?

96
00:09:10,733 --> 00:09:11,700
Exactly.

97
00:09:12,435 --> 00:09:14,903
One simply computes gravitonic tones...

98
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:17,337
...for a specific destination...

99
00:09:17,406 --> 00:09:19,306
...activates the energizer and--

100
00:09:19,508 --> 00:09:22,534
And that's how Skeletor's troops
got into the city and surprised us.

101
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,644
Yes.

102
00:09:29,018 --> 00:09:30,713
I'm afraid so.

103
00:09:31,087 --> 00:09:33,282
You little worm.

104
00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:36,057
- Don't you realize what you've done?
- Easy, Teela.

105
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:37,057
He didn't know.

106
00:09:37,126 --> 00:09:39,424
That's right. How could I know?

107
00:09:39,528 --> 00:09:41,655
We Thenurians are a peaceful race.

108
00:09:41,931 --> 00:09:43,796
Trusting in every way.

109
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,129
A woman came to see me.

110
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,904
Said she heard about my fame
as a locksmith.

111
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,504
She seemed interested in my work.

112
00:09:54,577 --> 00:09:56,875
How could I know
she was from Snake Mountain?

113
00:09:56,946 --> 00:09:59,380
- She was beautiful.
- That would be Evil-Lyn.

114
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:01,881
She tricked me. She stole the Key!

115
00:10:02,118 --> 00:10:03,244
Gwildor...

116
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:06,412
...can this device of yours
get us into Greyskull?

117
00:10:06,489 --> 00:10:07,387
Certainly.

118
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,222
To the Sorceress?

119
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:13,055
Those were the first coordinates
I calculated before she came.

120
00:10:13,262 --> 00:10:15,025
- Good!
- We can't, we can't.

121
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:17,529
If we disturb the gravitonic waves...

122
00:10:17,667 --> 00:10:19,760
...Skeletor's key will locate us.

123
00:10:20,836 --> 00:10:22,736
Sounds like he's already located us.

124
00:10:24,173 --> 00:10:25,834
Warlord, to the point!

125
00:10:28,911 --> 00:10:30,674
No, not that way.

126
00:10:30,913 --> 00:10:32,778
This way, the secret passage.

127
00:10:33,349 --> 00:10:35,544
- Hurry! Hurry!
- Look.

128
00:10:36,485 --> 00:10:38,919
In the corner, there. Let's move.

129
00:10:38,988 --> 00:10:40,785
Gwildor, where does this lead?

130
00:10:40,856 --> 00:10:43,154
To the caverns underneath Greyskull.

131
00:10:43,526 --> 00:10:44,788
Ionize!

132
00:10:46,195 --> 00:10:47,253
Gwildor, hurry.

133
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:49,127
- Yes, yes.
- Come on!

134
00:10:49,765 --> 00:10:51,562
I don't like adventures.

135
00:11:03,479 --> 00:11:05,003
Secure the room!

136
00:11:05,214 --> 00:11:06,203
Hurry!

137
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,215
Find the Key!

138
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:12,510
Tear this place apart!

139
00:11:22,298 --> 00:11:24,289
He-Man, we made it! Look.

140
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,496
I know he's here waiting for us.

141
00:11:26,569 --> 00:11:28,799
- You're right. It's too quiet.
- Look.

142
00:11:29,038 --> 00:11:30,335
The Sorceress.

143
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,029
Come on!

144
00:11:33,209 --> 00:11:34,574
Gwildor, hurry.

145
00:11:37,747 --> 00:11:39,214
- Be careful.
- Quiet.

146
00:11:59,402 --> 00:12:00,494
Sorceress?

147
00:12:02,505 --> 00:12:04,029
Sorceress, we'll free you.

148
00:12:04,106 --> 00:12:07,166
Skeletor has imprisoned me
within this energy field...

149
00:12:07,443 --> 00:12:09,411
...which only he can dissolve.

150
00:12:10,613 --> 00:12:14,743
- You are in danger here. You must leave.
- We won't leave without you, Sorceress.

151
00:12:14,884 --> 00:12:17,409
Gwildor, can your key open the door
to this force field?

152
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:19,044
- Of course.
- Then do it now.

153
00:12:19,355 --> 00:12:21,949
- It'll take time.
- Let's get started then.

154
00:12:22,024 --> 00:12:23,719
Gwildor, over here.

155
00:12:25,027 --> 00:12:26,494
I have to take a reading...

156
00:12:26,695 --> 00:12:28,822
...and compute the gravitonic tones.

157
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,397
He's taking your power.

158
00:12:30,466 --> 00:12:33,128
I can withstand him until moonrise.

159
00:12:34,136 --> 00:12:36,969
Until the Great Eye opens on the universe.

160
00:12:37,973 --> 00:12:39,031
They're coming!

161
00:12:39,975 --> 00:12:42,341
Gwildor, get back there. Keep working.

162
00:12:44,046 --> 00:12:45,206
Come on! Come on!

163
00:13:11,674 --> 00:13:14,507
Everything comes to he who waits.

164
00:13:16,912 --> 00:13:18,641
And I have waited...

165
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:23,147
...so very long for this moment.

166
00:13:23,786 --> 00:13:25,151
Let her go.

167
00:13:25,354 --> 00:13:26,719
I don't think so.

168
00:13:27,523 --> 00:13:28,512
No.

169
00:13:29,758 --> 00:13:32,989
While she remains imprisoned
within this field...

170
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,493
...her powers increase my own...

171
00:13:35,598 --> 00:13:38,089
...and when the moon reaches its zenith...

172
00:13:38,467 --> 00:13:40,697
...the Great Eye will open...

173
00:13:40,769 --> 00:13:43,670
...and all the powers of Greyskull...

174
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:45,900
...will be bestowed upon me.

175
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,540
Your wondrous Sorceress...

176
00:13:48,944 --> 00:13:50,411
...will die!

177
00:13:50,479 --> 00:13:52,208
You dare threaten her life!

178
00:13:52,381 --> 00:13:54,178
I dare anything!

179
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,710
I am Skeletor.

180
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:59,114
Throw down your weapons...

181
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:01,480
...and pledge yourselves to me...

182
00:14:01,724 --> 00:14:03,385
...or you will join her.

183
00:14:03,659 --> 00:14:05,786
It's not her you want, it's me.

184
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,953
It's always been between us.

185
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,086
Silence!

186
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,734
It's the locksmith.

187
00:14:12,968 --> 00:14:15,562
- The little worm has another key!
- What?

188
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:17,469
No.

189
00:14:18,741 --> 00:14:19,799
Kill him!

190
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,100
Take cover, Gwildor!

191
00:14:23,245 --> 00:14:24,473
Keep working!

192
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,592
Gwildor...

193
00:14:45,901 --> 00:14:47,869
...will that key get us out of here?

194
00:14:48,003 --> 00:14:50,437
It will! But where?

195
00:14:50,506 --> 00:14:52,406
Anywhere! Just do it fast!

196
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:54,066
Yes, yes.

197
00:14:59,381 --> 00:15:00,405
It's working!

198
00:15:11,026 --> 00:15:12,152
Man-At-Arms.

199
00:15:12,227 --> 00:15:14,161
Teela! I did it!

200
00:15:16,632 --> 00:15:18,532
The door! It's open! Let's go!

201
00:15:18,601 --> 00:15:19,397
He-Man!

202
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:21,469
No! I won't leave her!

203
00:15:21,737 --> 00:15:24,638
But you must.
Eternia needs you alive, He-Man.

204
00:15:24,707 --> 00:15:26,231
You still have until moonrise.

205
00:15:26,308 --> 00:15:27,206
Go!

206
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,546
He-Man, let's move!

207
00:15:33,616 --> 00:15:34,776
Come on, go!

208
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,110
Come on, Gwildor!

209
00:15:38,887 --> 00:15:39,615
Stop him!

210
00:15:41,624 --> 00:15:43,717
Gwildor, come on!

211
00:15:43,792 --> 00:15:45,817
The door! The door!

212
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:53,395
Gwildor!

213
00:15:54,103 --> 00:15:54,865
My Key!

214
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:57,268
The Key! Get the Key!

215
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:15,882
Find them.

216
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:17,518
Trace them!

217
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:20,829
I want them and the Key hunted down
and brought to me.

218
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:23,364
It looked as if he was punching the keys
at random.

219
00:16:23,432 --> 00:16:26,868
- There's no way to tell where they went.
- Monitor the frequencies!

220
00:16:27,002 --> 00:16:29,664
Wherever they are, they'll use it again.

221
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:31,706
When they do, lock it in.

222
00:16:31,774 --> 00:16:35,642
He-Man lives and possesses that Key.

223
00:16:35,878 --> 00:16:39,939
I must possess all, or I possess nothing!

224
00:16:40,516 --> 00:16:42,074
Find them.

225
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,510
Are you all right?

226
00:17:20,823 --> 00:17:23,519
Trust a Thenurian to find
a soft place to land.

227
00:17:26,862 --> 00:17:28,159
Thank you.

228
00:17:28,397 --> 00:17:31,525
I could have suffocated
in that loathsome stuff.

229
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,100
Stop complaining. It's only mud.

230
00:17:34,737 --> 00:17:37,968
That's easy to say
when you don't have clogged gill slits.

231
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,139
No!

232
00:17:41,744 --> 00:17:43,006
I'm sorry.

233
00:17:44,947 --> 00:17:45,936
Gwildor.

234
00:17:46,014 --> 00:17:47,948
We must get back to Eternia.

235
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:52,480
If you're through clearing your gill slits,
maybe you can tell us where we are?

236
00:17:52,788 --> 00:17:54,312
We could be anywhere.

237
00:17:54,389 --> 00:17:56,254
Any planet in the galaxy.

238
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:58,626
Any planet in a thousand galaxies.

239
00:17:59,094 --> 00:18:01,722
I had no time to renominalize
my coordinates.

240
00:18:02,464 --> 00:18:05,627
You got us here, you Thenurian wurbat,
now you get us home!

241
00:18:05,701 --> 00:18:08,192
Calm down.
Now we're all in this together.

242
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:10,737
How can he get us home
if we don't know where we are?

243
00:18:10,806 --> 00:18:12,398
I'm not a Torktum, you know.

244
00:18:12,474 --> 00:18:16,035
I wouldn't build a device
that didn't store its home coordinates.

245
00:18:16,645 --> 00:18:18,112
All we have to do...

246
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,707
...is punch the energizer switch and...

247
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:30,390
Where is the Key?

248
00:18:30,726 --> 00:18:32,023
Perimeter search.

249
00:18:32,127 --> 00:18:33,594
Each of us take a sector.

250
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,352
What's that?

251
00:18:44,807 --> 00:18:46,069
Scan the area.

252
00:18:49,978 --> 00:18:51,104
Alien life form.

253
00:18:51,647 --> 00:18:52,341
Big.

254
00:18:52,481 --> 00:18:53,812
- Let me blast it.
- Wait.

255
00:18:53,949 --> 00:18:55,211
It might be intelligent life.

256
00:18:58,954 --> 00:19:01,081
By the Sorceress, it's ugly.

257
00:19:01,857 --> 00:19:03,119
It seems harmless.

258
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:08,791
What a hideous cry.

259
00:19:09,665 --> 00:19:12,133
Maybe I can communicate
with the poor creature.

260
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,701
Gwildor.

261
00:19:17,172 --> 00:19:19,299
Gwildor, we have very little time.

262
00:19:19,374 --> 00:19:23,003
He-Man, I show .84 chromons
until moonrise at Greyskull.

263
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:25,706
- We better find the Key and fast.
- What's your plan?

264
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:29,209
When we find the Key, Gwildor
will set the coordinates for Greyskull.

265
00:19:29,284 --> 00:19:30,808
We'll use the element of surprise.

266
00:19:30,886 --> 00:19:32,820
We'll drop right into the throne room...

267
00:19:32,888 --> 00:19:35,516
...fight off 2,000 or 3,000
of Skeletor's crack troops...

268
00:19:35,657 --> 00:19:38,387
...break into the force field
and free the Sorceress.

269
00:19:38,627 --> 00:19:39,889
If we're going to split up...

270
00:19:39,962 --> 00:19:42,260
...we'd better synchronize
our personal locators.

271
00:19:42,464 --> 00:19:44,329
You both ready? And...

272
00:19:44,566 --> 00:19:45,897
If you find the Key...

273
00:19:46,034 --> 00:19:48,059
...activate the sourcing signal.

274
00:19:48,704 --> 00:19:50,638
- Good journey.
- Good journey.

275
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:02,539
Gwildor.

276
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,816
I'm going. I'm going.

277
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:13,192
Thanks. Come again.

278
00:20:13,262 --> 00:20:14,661
Sure thing, ma'am.

279
00:20:14,763 --> 00:20:17,698
Billy, get off that game
and get Daddy some napkins.

280
00:20:18,667 --> 00:20:22,296
I never thought I'd feel sad
doing that for the very last time.

281
00:20:22,504 --> 00:20:25,530
Don't worry, Julie.
They've got fast food in Jersey.

282
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:26,869
Thanks a lot.

283
00:20:28,443 --> 00:20:31,970
I got a going-away present for you,
but it isn't wrapped.

284
00:20:32,047 --> 00:20:34,811
- You didn't have to do that.
- It isn't even in a box.

285
00:20:34,883 --> 00:20:38,080
It's a piece of advice,
and I pray to God you listen to it.

286
00:20:39,788 --> 00:20:44,418
If you break up with Kevin Corrigan,
you will regret it for the rest of your life.

287
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,791
Monica, this is not the 7th grade anymore.

288
00:20:47,296 --> 00:20:50,788
Kevin's changed. I've changed.
Everything's different now.

289
00:20:50,966 --> 00:20:52,831
Fine. Except for two things.

290
00:20:52,968 --> 00:20:55,630
A: you still love him
and B: he still loves you.

291
00:20:55,704 --> 00:20:58,070
Kevin doesn't need me
or my problems right now.

292
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,265
I just feel if I stayed--

293
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:03,903
Julie, I know it's hard right now...

294
00:21:03,979 --> 00:21:05,810
...but you don't have to move away.

295
00:21:06,315 --> 00:21:09,307
- Yes, I do. - Your folks would
have wanted you to stay.

296
00:21:10,619 --> 00:21:14,385
The best thing for me to do right now
is to get 3,000 miles away from Kevin...

297
00:21:14,456 --> 00:21:17,948
...my house, this town and everything,
and just start out fresh.

298
00:21:20,262 --> 00:21:21,320
That's Kevin.

299
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,997
I'm going to miss you.

300
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:34,774
So, what time's your bus to the airport?

301
00:21:35,177 --> 00:21:36,974
- 8:30.
- Great.

302
00:21:37,179 --> 00:21:39,113
You can make my sound check, right?

303
00:21:40,415 --> 00:21:41,507
Yes?

304
00:21:41,783 --> 00:21:45,219
- Yes, I'll make your sound check.
- All right.

305
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:47,650
I brought us dinner.

306
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,691
Oh boy, Robby's Ribs.

307
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:52,624
I thought it was something different
for a change.

308
00:21:53,428 --> 00:21:56,420
Yeah, well, it's not very romantic
for our last date.

309
00:22:00,769 --> 00:22:03,260
Look, Julie,
why don't you take a later flight...

310
00:22:03,338 --> 00:22:05,932
Kevin, don't start that again.

311
00:22:06,675 --> 00:22:07,733
We decided.

312
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:11,371
Okay.

313
00:22:13,281 --> 00:22:16,808
<i>Kevin, I'd like to go to the cemetery
to say goodbye to my parents.</i>

314
00:22:16,952 --> 00:22:19,011
<i>Yeah, sure.</i>

315
00:22:39,408 --> 00:22:41,137
Don't ever sneak up on me like that.

316
00:22:41,209 --> 00:22:43,700
This is my sector.
You're not supposed to be here.

317
00:22:43,979 --> 00:22:46,413
An old soldier learns to follow his nose.

318
00:22:46,581 --> 00:22:49,607
- Father, you're always hungry.
- I'm not always hungry.

319
00:22:50,018 --> 00:22:53,476
During the Siege of Kreyf,
30 days without rations.

320
00:22:54,222 --> 00:22:57,089
Father, the Sorceress.
We must find the Key!

321
00:22:57,159 --> 00:23:00,287
We're not going to save Eternia
if we die of starvation.

322
00:23:00,929 --> 00:23:02,328
Wait. Look.

323
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:06,699
I was doing that
before you were even born.

324
00:23:06,768 --> 00:23:09,362
Not the natives, Father.
There, in the bushes.

325
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:21,905
Gwildor.

326
00:23:36,064 --> 00:23:37,463
Holding out on us, huh?

327
00:23:38,934 --> 00:23:41,732
Just in time. I was going to share.

328
00:23:43,238 --> 00:23:44,500
Sure you were.

329
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:48,164
Teela.

330
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:51,573
Good food.

331
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:54,743
Yes, I've never tasted anything like it.

332
00:23:56,051 --> 00:23:58,713
I wonder why they put the food
on these little white sticks.

333
00:23:59,387 --> 00:24:00,581
Those are rib bones.

334
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:07,593
This used to be an animal?

335
00:24:14,503 --> 00:24:16,266
What a barbaric world.

336
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:18,236
Never think while you're hungry.

337
00:24:18,507 --> 00:24:20,907
I think we've wasted enough time.

338
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:23,503
We better get back to our sectors.

339
00:24:26,181 --> 00:24:26,772
Gwildor?

340
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:29,846
It tasted good.

341
00:24:30,185 --> 00:24:31,152
Gwildor.

342
00:24:31,686 --> 00:24:33,449
I'm going. I'm going.

343
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:38,249
I never told anyone this before:

344
00:24:39,294 --> 00:24:40,955
It's my fault they died.

345
00:24:42,664 --> 00:24:43,961
Julie, come on.

346
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:49,666
It was a plane crash.
Those things just happen.

347
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,664
You don't understand.

348
00:24:55,443 --> 00:24:58,241
We were all supposed to go
to the beach that day.

349
00:24:59,214 --> 00:25:02,980
But I said I had to study because
I wanted to spend the day with you.

350
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,945
So they took the plane to Catalina instead.

351
00:25:09,057 --> 00:25:10,354
Come on.

352
00:25:14,629 --> 00:25:18,565
Your mom and dad wouldn't want you
to blame yourself all the rest of your life.

353
00:25:19,701 --> 00:25:20,793
Would they?

354
00:25:21,136 --> 00:25:22,125
No.

355
00:25:30,845 --> 00:25:32,745
I wish I could change things.

356
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:36,617
But you can't.

357
00:25:37,586 --> 00:25:39,781
That only happens in fairy tales.

358
00:25:47,862 --> 00:25:49,090
What is that?

359
00:25:50,498 --> 00:25:53,331
- Julie, be careful!
- But, Kev, look at this thing.

360
00:25:55,203 --> 00:25:56,898
That is incredible. What is it?

361
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:59,065
I don't know.
Someone must have dropped it.

362
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:02,007
Dropped it, are you kidding?
Look at the size of that hole!

363
00:26:02,077 --> 00:26:04,204
It's like it fell out of the sky or something.

364
00:26:06,615 --> 00:26:09,175
This is one of those
new Japanese synthesizers.

365
00:26:09,351 --> 00:26:11,080
- Here, let me try it.
- Okay.

366
00:26:14,256 --> 00:26:15,553
Listen to this!

367
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,056
This is hot.

368
00:26:20,128 --> 00:26:22,323
We've got to turn this in to the caretaker.

369
00:26:22,397 --> 00:26:25,798
No way, come on, are you kidding?
He'd just keep this for himself.

370
00:26:31,139 --> 00:26:33,164
The Cosmic Key has been activated.

371
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:35,070
We have a bearing on them.

372
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,738
How accurate?

373
00:26:37,379 --> 00:26:38,846
Within a parsec eon.

374
00:26:40,548 --> 00:26:45,383
The next time they use the Key,
lock in the source and open a doorway.

375
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,717
Shall I prepare a full battalion?

376
00:26:47,789 --> 00:26:49,416
No. It may be a trap.

377
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:52,489
We'll send an advance group.

378
00:26:52,794 --> 00:26:54,785
Assemble the mercenaries.

379
00:26:57,565 --> 00:26:59,465
Have faith, Sorceress.

380
00:27:00,302 --> 00:27:02,099
You won't be lonely long.

381
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:24,881
Julie...

382
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,155
...here, listen to this.

383
00:27:32,801 --> 00:27:34,029
What do you think?

384
00:27:34,102 --> 00:27:35,330
Sounds great.

385
00:27:36,705 --> 00:27:37,865
Okay.

386
00:27:39,341 --> 00:27:41,935
I want to see what this thing can really do.

387
00:27:42,377 --> 00:27:45,471
<i>Test, test, test. Hello, test.</i>

388
00:27:46,881 --> 00:27:48,212
Here, hold that.

389
00:27:49,317 --> 00:27:50,716
What are you going to do?

390
00:27:50,785 --> 00:27:53,686
I'm going to amp this baby up.
See how it sounds.

391
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,716
All right, are you ready?

392
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:57,048
Hold on.

393
00:27:58,326 --> 00:27:59,793
All right, here goes.

394
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:17,177
I can't believe it.

395
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,279
Override complete.

396
00:28:20,648 --> 00:28:23,344
We're locking in
on the Key's source of origin.

397
00:28:23,418 --> 00:28:25,147
Very good. Excellent.

398
00:28:25,553 --> 00:28:27,783
You are too easily pleased, Evil-Lyn.

399
00:28:28,156 --> 00:28:30,989
Have you forgotten time is of the essence?

400
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,949
Show me!

401
00:28:38,199 --> 00:28:40,167
There! That's close enough.

402
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:44,501
Have you assembled the mercenaries?

403
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:46,998
Here, and awaiting your command.

404
00:28:48,243 --> 00:28:51,337
I have selected your finest warriors.

405
00:28:52,347 --> 00:28:53,314
Blade.

406
00:28:56,551 --> 00:28:57,540
Saurod.

407
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:02,683
The Beastman.

408
00:29:05,427 --> 00:29:06,587
And Karg.

409
00:29:12,534 --> 00:29:14,468
A curious quartet.

410
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:18,334
He-Man has slipped away from me.

411
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,507
I want him back.

412
00:29:20,942 --> 00:29:23,376
This must happen before moonrise.

413
00:29:23,878 --> 00:29:27,006
Now, you are to go through to this world
to where they are hiding.

414
00:29:27,081 --> 00:29:28,105
Find the Key.

415
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:31,675
Do as you wish with the others,
but bring He-Man back alive.

416
00:29:33,288 --> 00:29:36,189
- You do understand?
- Yes, Lord.

417
00:29:37,258 --> 00:29:38,156
Good.

418
00:29:40,462 --> 00:29:42,828
Open the door. Do not fail me.

419
00:29:46,668 --> 00:29:47,794
I can't believe this thing!

420
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:49,860
I mean, did you see those lights?

421
00:29:49,938 --> 00:29:52,168
Look, we've got to take this
down to Charlie.

422
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,073
- He's got to know what this is.
- No, you go ahead.

423
00:29:55,443 --> 00:29:59,504
This sounds really strange,
but I want to spend some time here alone.

424
00:29:59,581 --> 00:30:02,982
Say goodbye to the place.
I'm not going to be here for graduation.

425
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:06,551
Look, Julie. I'll just go by Charlie's later.

426
00:30:06,621 --> 00:30:08,282
No, go ahead, I promise.

427
00:30:08,423 --> 00:30:09,651
Are you sure?

428
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:13,755
Okay, all right.
I'll be gone 15 minutes tops, all right?

429
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:16,860
- Don't let anybody in here except Carl.
- All right.

430
00:30:17,465 --> 00:30:18,693
You hear me?

431
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:21,828
- I'll guard this stuff for you.
- All right, 'bye.

432
00:30:57,071 --> 00:30:57,799
Carl?

433
00:31:11,019 --> 00:31:12,145
Carl, is that you?

434
00:31:13,087 --> 00:31:15,055
- Blade!
- Yes, sir, no sign of the Key.

435
00:31:15,223 --> 00:31:17,589
Scan the perimeter!
No one in, no one out!

436
00:31:17,992 --> 00:31:20,927
Kevin, if this is some kind of joke,
it's really not funny.

437
00:31:23,331 --> 00:31:25,458
Listen, you kids can't just come in here.

438
00:31:27,335 --> 00:31:28,893
Don't kill him yet!

439
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:39,678
Leave him alone!

440
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:48,019
Somebody help me!

441
00:31:49,123 --> 00:31:51,489
No! No! Take her alive!

442
00:31:51,626 --> 00:31:53,116
She may know where the Key is!

443
00:31:57,198 --> 00:31:59,063
That way! Go around!

444
00:32:14,983 --> 00:32:16,780
- I've got you, pretty!
- No!

445
00:32:19,287 --> 00:32:20,879
Let go! Stay away from me!

446
00:32:21,255 --> 00:32:22,244
Let go!

447
00:32:23,057 --> 00:32:24,046
Get her!

448
00:32:28,663 --> 00:32:29,595
She's mine!

449
00:32:40,742 --> 00:32:41,766
Stop her!

450
00:32:47,982 --> 00:32:50,644
Move, you animals! Go! Go!

451
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:55,682
Find her! Find her!

452
00:33:05,166 --> 00:33:06,360
Help me!

453
00:33:06,701 --> 00:33:08,225
Help me!

454
00:33:12,607 --> 00:33:14,268
Somebody help me!

455
00:33:16,177 --> 00:33:17,644
Oh God, help!

456
00:33:23,151 --> 00:33:25,642
She's in there! This way!

457
00:33:36,998 --> 00:33:39,489
She's in here somewhere! Find her!

458
00:33:48,209 --> 00:33:49,437
Get away from me!

459
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:50,636
It's all right!

460
00:33:50,712 --> 00:33:53,579
It's all right.
Don't be afraid, I won't hurt you.

461
00:33:54,015 --> 00:33:55,778
What are you running from?

462
00:33:56,984 --> 00:33:58,918
I'm running from these...

463
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,652
- ...monsters.
- Easy, easy.

464
00:34:01,723 --> 00:34:03,953
- Creatures.
- I'll take care of it.

465
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:07,522
Look in there!

466
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:11,859
Look up that way.

467
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,099
Search over there!

468
00:34:15,703 --> 00:34:17,466
- You! Over there!
- No!

469
00:34:18,339 --> 00:34:20,034
Search in there! Hurry!

470
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:28,372
Here, take this.

471
00:34:29,283 --> 00:34:30,773
Protect yourself.

472
00:34:34,689 --> 00:34:36,054
She's over here.

473
00:34:36,758 --> 00:34:37,850
This way.

474
00:35:17,799 --> 00:35:18,458
No!

475
00:35:38,352 --> 00:35:40,445
I've waited a long time for this.

476
00:35:56,804 --> 00:35:57,793
My sword!

477
00:36:03,311 --> 00:36:04,141
Pretty!

478
00:36:24,966 --> 00:36:27,958
Retreat! Retreat!

479
00:36:37,645 --> 00:36:40,443
Follow them!
They must have a doorway to Eternia!

480
00:36:40,815 --> 00:36:42,180
Are you all right?

481
00:36:43,851 --> 00:36:45,842
They're gone now. You're safe.

482
00:36:46,087 --> 00:36:48,021
You're safe. Do you understand?

483
00:36:50,524 --> 00:36:51,456
Good.

484
00:36:51,525 --> 00:36:55,484
I know you've been through a great deal,
but I need your help.

485
00:37:06,374 --> 00:37:07,363
Charlie!

486
00:37:08,175 --> 00:37:09,164
Charlie!

487
00:37:09,944 --> 00:37:11,502
Kev, how are you?

488
00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:13,740
Turn that down, turn that down.

489
00:37:14,181 --> 00:37:16,012
Look, wait until you see this.

490
00:37:16,083 --> 00:37:19,246
I heard you were good last night
at Club Zero.

491
00:37:19,754 --> 00:37:23,747
Thanks. We're going to be better tonight.
I want you to take a look at this baby.

492
00:37:25,026 --> 00:37:26,288
All right, here.

493
00:37:28,262 --> 00:37:29,490
What do you think?

494
00:37:29,563 --> 00:37:31,463
I've seen these before.

495
00:37:31,899 --> 00:37:33,196
- You have?
- Yeah.

496
00:37:33,367 --> 00:37:34,561
It's Japanese.

497
00:37:34,635 --> 00:37:36,296
No, no, no.

498
00:37:36,537 --> 00:37:38,630
I don't think so. Here, look.

499
00:37:39,106 --> 00:37:41,404
Press a few of these buttons. Go ahead.

500
00:37:45,279 --> 00:37:47,509
Now press that red button in the front.

501
00:37:47,581 --> 00:37:48,570
Go ahead.

502
00:37:57,091 --> 00:37:59,582
Far out. Fantastic.

503
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:07,364
You know, I guess if you've seen one,
you've seen them all, right?

504
00:38:07,835 --> 00:38:10,303
Thanks a lot, Charlie. I'll talk to you later.

505
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:12,896
Come back here. Where'd you get that?

506
00:38:12,974 --> 00:38:15,568
- Do you want to sell it?
- I don't want to sell it.

507
00:38:15,643 --> 00:38:17,508
I found this at Laurelwood.

508
00:38:17,578 --> 00:38:19,136
You would not believe it.

509
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:21,773
It was like, it was lying in this huge crater.

510
00:38:21,849 --> 00:38:24,340
I was just hoping
you'd know something about it.

511
00:38:24,418 --> 00:38:26,045
I never saw anything like it.

512
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,610
We've got to figure out--

513
00:38:27,755 --> 00:38:28,915
What's that?

514
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:31,248
D sharp.

515
00:38:31,926 --> 00:38:33,325
Mr. Perfect Pitch.

516
00:38:37,031 --> 00:38:38,965
All hell's breaking loose out there.

517
00:38:39,033 --> 00:38:40,523
Let's see what's up.

518
00:38:43,104 --> 00:38:46,540
<i>All units, Code 6.
Proceed to Central High School.</i>

519
00:38:46,607 --> 00:38:48,768
<i>Fire and vandalism. Possible arson.</i>

520
00:38:48,943 --> 00:38:51,343
<i>Repeat: All units, Code 6.</i>

521
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:54,104
<i>Proceed to Central High School.
Fire and vandalism.</i>

522
00:38:54,181 --> 00:38:55,808
Julie's in there.

523
00:38:56,951 --> 00:39:00,352
Our only hope of defeating Skeletor
is to find the Cosmic Key.

524
00:39:00,988 --> 00:39:04,014
Now those creatures were after you
for a reason, Julie.

525
00:39:04,125 --> 00:39:05,490
Have you seen it?

526
00:39:06,227 --> 00:39:08,195
It's this large. It has lights on it.

527
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:09,957
Wait a minute, I have seen that.

528
00:39:10,031 --> 00:39:14,229
My boyfriend and I found this thing
that had light and music coming out of it.

529
00:39:14,301 --> 00:39:15,734
That's it. Where is it?

530
00:39:16,237 --> 00:39:17,204
Kevin has it.

531
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:19,364
He's in terrible danger. Let's go.

532
00:39:48,702 --> 00:39:51,728
- Carl, what happened?
- You don't never want to know.

533
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:54,873
Wait, listen to me. Carl, where is Julie?

534
00:39:55,076 --> 00:39:56,703
What happened to Julie?

535
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:06,752
- Where you going?
- My girlfriend's in there.

536
00:40:06,887 --> 00:40:07,945
We swept the place.

537
00:40:08,022 --> 00:40:10,490
The only person we found in there
was the janitor.

538
00:40:10,591 --> 00:40:13,424
You don't understand.
I just left her here 10 minutes ago.

539
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:15,894
We went through there with a police dog.

540
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:18,794
The only stuff we found in there
was right there.

541
00:40:19,633 --> 00:40:22,363
Dear God, that's Julie's.
Where'd you find this?

542
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:24,164
Where do you think we found it?

543
00:40:24,238 --> 00:40:27,901
We got vandalism, arson,
we have bad stuff going on around here.

544
00:40:27,975 --> 00:40:31,433
- What do you know about it?
- I don't know anything about it.

545
00:40:31,745 --> 00:40:34,213
You're the cop.
Why aren't you out looking for her?

546
00:40:34,281 --> 00:40:35,748
What does she look like?

547
00:40:35,883 --> 00:40:38,283
Look, she's about 5' 5"...

548
00:40:38,619 --> 00:40:42,146
...she's got short, dark hair,
she was wearing a pink sweater.

549
00:40:43,557 --> 00:40:46,185
Is that all you're going to do,
you're going to write?

550
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:47,852
Why aren't you out doing something?

551
00:40:47,928 --> 00:40:51,762
I'll do something.
I'll take you for a little ride. Let's go.

552
00:40:52,233 --> 00:40:56,329
- What are you doing, arresting me?
- We're going to go look for your girlfriend.

553
00:40:56,403 --> 00:40:58,997
We'll try her house first.
I bet you know where that is.

554
00:40:59,073 --> 00:41:00,199
Harry, do me a favor.

555
00:41:00,274 --> 00:41:03,505
Take that down to properties,
give me a full report, okay?

556
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:07,578
Keep the coffee hot.
Looks like it's going to be a long night.

557
00:41:07,648 --> 00:41:09,946
Come on, guys, let's pull it out.

558
00:41:13,988 --> 00:41:15,478
He-Man, they got away.

559
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:17,214
Easy, Julie.

560
00:41:17,525 --> 00:41:18,787
What happened?

561
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:22,151
These are friends of mine:
Teela and her father, Duncan.

562
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:24,857
- Man-At-Arms to Eternian High Command.
- This is Julie.

563
00:41:25,166 --> 00:41:27,157
She knows who has the Key
and wants to help us.

564
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:27,859
Good.

565
00:41:27,935 --> 00:41:30,733
- Did you have any luck?
- Not as much as you, apparently.

566
00:41:31,038 --> 00:41:33,233
We tracked them spinward, 40 metrons.

567
00:41:33,307 --> 00:41:34,740
And then they disappeared.

568
00:41:34,808 --> 00:41:36,275
They're only a scouting party.

569
00:41:36,343 --> 00:41:38,743
Let's find that Key
before they return in full force.

570
00:41:38,812 --> 00:41:40,643
- Julie, which way?
- This way.

571
00:41:45,319 --> 00:41:47,116
Take arms! Full power!

572
00:41:48,822 --> 00:41:49,789
Ready!

573
00:41:52,126 --> 00:41:55,425
Native transportation.
A primitive land boat.

574
00:41:55,629 --> 00:41:57,028
Enter, enter.

575
00:41:57,198 --> 00:41:58,187
Gwildor.

576
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:00,400
Well done, Gwildor.

577
00:42:02,169 --> 00:42:05,434
It was an inefficient combustible system,
but I fixed it.

578
00:42:05,506 --> 00:42:08,737
It runs on lucrenos now.
No hydrocarbons needed.

579
00:42:22,156 --> 00:42:23,487
Why is there still resistance?

580
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:30,422
The people must know that I am Greyskull.

581
00:42:31,432 --> 00:42:34,629
I depend upon you for these things.

582
00:42:35,369 --> 00:42:36,859
You know that.

583
00:42:38,372 --> 00:42:39,600
The people...

584
00:42:40,874 --> 00:42:42,842
...wait for He-Man.

585
00:42:43,444 --> 00:42:46,072
They believe that he will return
to lead them.

586
00:42:47,748 --> 00:42:49,682
For you to rule completely...

587
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:52,714
...he must be destroyed.

588
00:42:53,587 --> 00:42:55,054
He-Man.

589
00:42:55,522 --> 00:42:58,855
If I kill him, I make him a martyr, a saint.

590
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:01,760
No, I want him broken.

591
00:43:22,383 --> 00:43:23,509
Where is the Key?

592
00:43:24,551 --> 00:43:25,449
We...

593
00:43:26,253 --> 00:43:28,448
...traced the Key's signal...

594
00:43:29,323 --> 00:43:32,156
...but were unable to take possession of it.

595
00:43:32,793 --> 00:43:34,192
Is that all?

596
00:43:34,261 --> 00:43:38,994
We fought with the Eternians,
but we were outnumbered.

597
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,527
We thought it wise to return alive...

598
00:43:41,602 --> 00:43:43,866
...and gather a larger force.

599
00:43:44,138 --> 00:43:45,435
So, He-Man's free?

600
00:43:54,081 --> 00:43:57,710
You are all aware of the penalty for failure?

601
00:43:58,152 --> 00:44:02,020
Give me one more chance, Lord Skeletor,
and we will succeed!

602
00:44:02,356 --> 00:44:05,792
I am not in the giving vein this day.

603
00:44:20,974 --> 00:44:22,236
Get away!

604
00:44:24,178 --> 00:44:27,477
He begs your forgiveness as do we all.

605
00:44:27,648 --> 00:44:31,243
We live only to serve you.

606
00:44:31,652 --> 00:44:33,950
It would be a pity to waste their talents.

607
00:44:34,021 --> 00:44:35,955
Save your pity for yourself...

608
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:37,553
...if you fail!

609
00:44:38,292 --> 00:44:41,659
Take them and whatever troops
and resources you need.

610
00:44:42,029 --> 00:44:43,894
I was not suggesting that I go.

611
00:44:43,964 --> 00:44:46,159
Then you should not have spoken.

612
00:44:46,367 --> 00:44:47,664
Leave immediately.

613
00:44:47,868 --> 00:44:51,269
When you find the Key,
send the sourcing signal...

614
00:44:51,338 --> 00:44:55,570
...and an attack force will join you
or I will follow.

615
00:45:00,581 --> 00:45:01,411
Go!

616
00:45:19,233 --> 00:45:21,428
Maybe your girlfriend's here.
The lights are on.

617
00:45:21,502 --> 00:45:24,562
No. They just leave that on
to scare off the burglars.

618
00:45:24,738 --> 00:45:25,932
Let's go see.

619
00:45:32,413 --> 00:45:33,846
Not so fast, kid.

620
00:45:41,255 --> 00:45:42,017
Hello?

621
00:45:42,289 --> 00:45:43,483
Kevin, thank God it's you.

622
00:45:45,192 --> 00:45:46,716
Julie's not here right now.

623
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:49,292
Kevin, this is Julie. What's going on?

624
00:45:49,763 --> 00:45:53,995
It's good to hear your voice, too,
but I've been really worried about Julie.

625
00:45:54,635 --> 00:45:56,796
Kevin, is someone there? Are you okay?

626
00:45:56,870 --> 00:45:59,270
Yeah. That's what I thought, too.

627
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:02,600
This is important.
I know you can't talk, just say yes or no.

628
00:46:02,876 --> 00:46:04,867
Do you still have that thing we found?

629
00:46:08,415 --> 00:46:09,507
Thank God.

630
00:46:09,883 --> 00:46:13,944
All right, listen. Don't do anything.
I have so much to explain to you.

631
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:17,787
Just stay there, we'll be right there.
Stay put, all right?

632
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:19,659
I love you.

633
00:46:19,726 --> 00:46:20,658
<i>'Bye.</i>

634
00:46:21,094 --> 00:46:24,359
- If you talk to Julie, could you tell her--
- Wait a minute.

635
00:46:24,431 --> 00:46:26,922
This is the police, who is this?
Who is this?

636
00:46:28,101 --> 00:46:31,161
- Who were you talking to?
- It was just a friend of Julie's.

637
00:46:31,238 --> 00:46:33,263
- Say, are you hungry?
- No.

638
00:46:34,341 --> 00:46:37,037
You were talking about this thing,
weren't you?

639
00:46:41,782 --> 00:46:44,046
- What is this thing?
- It's a synthesizer.

640
00:46:46,587 --> 00:46:50,023
- How does this thing work?
- Just press these buttons right here.

641
00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:52,183
- Like this?
- Careful, careful!

642
00:46:59,032 --> 00:47:01,057
Do you want to know something, kid?

643
00:47:02,469 --> 00:47:04,460
I don't think this is any synthesizer.

644
00:47:22,556 --> 00:47:24,353
This is where they ambushed us.

645
00:47:24,458 --> 00:47:26,016
We didn't have a chance.

646
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:27,583
We'll see. Scanner.

647
00:47:36,236 --> 00:47:37,669
I see only He-Man.

648
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:41,832
Where are the forces that you spoke of?

649
00:47:45,779 --> 00:47:47,474
And a native girl.

650
00:47:48,582 --> 00:47:51,380
It must have been she
who tipped the scales against you.

651
00:47:54,087 --> 00:47:55,486
Outnumbered?

652
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:58,883
Outclassed is more like it.

653
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:00,517
The Key has been activated.

654
00:48:00,727 --> 00:48:01,989
Lock onto the signal.

655
00:48:03,163 --> 00:48:05,222
It's close. About 10 metrons.

656
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:08,898
You want to see what it does,
press the red button down at the bottom.

657
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:10,334
What? This one?

658
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:15,741
Holy smokes.

659
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:19,806
What are you, a magician?

660
00:48:20,847 --> 00:48:22,644
How do you stop this?

661
00:48:32,359 --> 00:48:34,827
What's a kid like you
doing with something like that?

662
00:48:34,895 --> 00:48:36,556
Come on. It's my instrument.

663
00:48:37,464 --> 00:48:40,160
Let me heat this up
and I'll show you, okay?

664
00:48:41,301 --> 00:48:44,065
We're getting interference.
They're jamming the signal.

665
00:48:44,137 --> 00:48:46,867
Locate the source of the jamming
and destroy it.

666
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:50,032
It's difficult, like nothing I've seen before.

667
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:51,236
Destroy it.

668
00:48:52,145 --> 00:48:53,009
Now!

669
00:48:56,950 --> 00:48:58,281
Watch out!

670
00:49:01,722 --> 00:49:06,250
The source of interference is destroyed.
We have a clear signal from the Key.

671
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,828
Lock it in. We'll track it from the air.

672
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:12,263
You, turkey! Sit down!

673
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,930
- No more crapping around. What's this?
- I don't know.

674
00:49:16,003 --> 00:49:19,837
I got vandalism and arson,
I got stuff blowing up in my face...

675
00:49:19,906 --> 00:49:22,636
- You better know something.
- I found it, okay?

676
00:49:23,076 --> 00:49:25,101
You found it?
You don't know who the owner is?

677
00:49:25,178 --> 00:49:26,008
No.

678
00:49:26,513 --> 00:49:29,641
I was going to put a note
down in Charlie's music store.

679
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:31,183
You know what I'll do?

680
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:34,183
I'll take this to the station
and put it on the computer.

681
00:49:34,254 --> 00:49:36,722
I'll check to see if it's reported stolen.

682
00:49:36,790 --> 00:49:38,724
For the last time, kid,
where'd you find this?

683
00:49:41,595 --> 00:49:43,085
Laurelwood Cemetery.

684
00:49:43,697 --> 00:49:45,324
It was in a flowerbed.

685
00:49:45,999 --> 00:49:48,797
Look, if you don't believe me,
go ask Charlie, all right?

686
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:50,999
- Go ahead, ask him.
- Boy...

687
00:49:52,372 --> 00:49:53,805
...I just may do that.

688
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:55,534
You can't just take that.

689
00:49:56,043 --> 00:49:57,101
You watch me.

690
00:49:57,277 --> 00:50:00,144
Don't worry about your girlfriend.
We got an APB out on her.

691
00:50:00,213 --> 00:50:01,407
She won't get far.

692
00:50:01,481 --> 00:50:03,949
As far as this thing is concerned,
don't worry about it.

693
00:50:04,017 --> 00:50:06,577
If your story checks out, you'll get it back.

694
00:50:08,155 --> 00:50:08,985
If...

695
00:50:35,015 --> 00:50:36,141
Get out of here!

696
00:50:36,316 --> 00:50:38,443
Get out of here! Get out of here!

697
00:50:50,664 --> 00:50:52,461
What do you want from me?

698
00:50:54,101 --> 00:50:55,193
No!

699
00:50:56,002 --> 00:50:57,094
Leave him.

700
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:05,278
You have the Cosmic Key.
Tell us where it is!

701
00:51:05,445 --> 00:51:07,572
I don't know what you are talking about.

702
00:51:07,681 --> 00:51:09,774
- Let me persuade him.
- No.

703
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:11,610
The collar.

704
00:51:16,790 --> 00:51:17,779
Please.

705
00:51:17,958 --> 00:51:20,051
Look, I don't know what you want.

706
00:51:24,231 --> 00:51:25,220
Now...

707
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:29,192
...you will answer my questions.

708
00:51:31,238 --> 00:51:32,102
<i>Yes.</i>

709
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:34,304
Yes.

710
00:51:54,561 --> 00:51:56,028
Have you seen...

711
00:51:57,097 --> 00:51:58,564
...this object?

712
00:52:05,005 --> 00:52:05,869
<i>Yes.</i>

713
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:08,838
Where is it?

714
00:52:10,477 --> 00:52:11,808
<i>It was taken from me.</i>

715
00:52:12,145 --> 00:52:13,305
Who took it?

716
00:52:15,582 --> 00:52:16,776
<i>A policeman.</i>

717
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:19,412
Where is he now?

718
00:52:20,253 --> 00:52:21,515
<i>I don't know.</i>

719
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:24,284
<i>He just left.</i>

720
00:52:24,591 --> 00:52:26,991
We should be able
to track the Key from the air.

721
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:28,125
Yes.

722
00:52:30,864 --> 00:52:32,991
Prepare the Transport immediately.

723
00:52:36,870 --> 00:52:40,033
Wait! Evil-Lyn, I found this.

724
00:52:40,807 --> 00:52:44,470
This is the native girl
who is helping He-Man.

725
00:52:44,978 --> 00:52:46,570
This may prove useful.

726
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:48,905
Into the Transport. Move.

727
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:54,446
Move it out! Move!

728
00:53:44,204 --> 00:53:45,398
- Fan out!
- Moving!

729
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:47,337
Looks like Skeletor got here before us.

730
00:53:47,407 --> 00:53:49,398
- It's all clear over here.
- Stay ready.

731
00:53:50,277 --> 00:53:51,244
Kevin.

732
00:53:52,746 --> 00:53:54,646
My God, Kevin, are you all right?

733
00:53:54,915 --> 00:53:56,314
He's bleeding.

734
00:53:56,416 --> 00:53:57,576
What happened?

735
00:53:57,851 --> 00:54:01,048
<i>They asked me for the Key,
but I didn't have it.</i>

736
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:02,618
The Cosmic Key.

737
00:54:02,722 --> 00:54:04,622
Kevin, did they take it?

738
00:54:05,725 --> 00:54:06,623
<i>No.</i>

739
00:54:07,961 --> 00:54:09,553
<i>A policeman took it.</i>

740
00:54:09,729 --> 00:54:10,991
Where's he now?

741
00:54:11,264 --> 00:54:12,731
What is this thing?

742
00:54:12,799 --> 00:54:15,267
- What's the matter with him?
- Skeletor's work.

743
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:17,394
The Collar of Aldruber.
They were questioning him.

744
00:54:17,470 --> 00:54:20,064
- I'll have it off in a moment.
- He'll be all right.

745
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:21,630
Who put this on you?

746
00:54:22,475 --> 00:54:23,703
<i>A woman.</i>

747
00:54:24,711 --> 00:54:27,236
<i>- Strange eyes.
- Evil-Lyn. She's here.</i>

748
00:54:28,148 --> 00:54:31,117
From the looks of this place
she definitely wasn't alone.

749
00:54:32,652 --> 00:54:34,051
Are you all right?

750
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:36,844
Julie!

751
00:54:37,324 --> 00:54:38,951
Julie, get out of here!

752
00:54:39,192 --> 00:54:40,090
Now!

753
00:54:41,828 --> 00:54:42,692
Damn!

754
00:54:42,762 --> 00:54:45,253
- Kevin, these are my friends!
- Your friends!

755
00:54:46,833 --> 00:54:49,859
Will somebody tell me
what the hell is going on here?

756
00:54:49,936 --> 00:54:52,461
These creatures come in
and start to beat the crap--

757
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:53,870
Kevin, listen to me!

758
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:56,170
These people are fighting
against the others.

759
00:54:56,242 --> 00:54:58,870
- They saved my life, now trust me.
- Trust you?

760
00:54:58,945 --> 00:55:01,345
Julie, I swear to God, these...

761
00:55:01,581 --> 00:55:02,980
..."things" come in here...

762
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:04,846
I mean, look at this place!

763
00:55:05,685 --> 00:55:06,845
Look. Look.

764
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:08,351
Native clothing.

765
00:55:08,588 --> 00:55:10,579
Lots of it, all over the place.

766
00:55:11,658 --> 00:55:14,491
If we dress like this,
no one will recognize us.

767
00:55:14,794 --> 00:55:16,125
What the hell is that?

768
00:55:16,196 --> 00:55:17,060
See?

769
00:55:17,530 --> 00:55:18,827
That's Gwildor.

770
00:55:19,065 --> 00:55:21,033
Kevin, I'll explain to you as we go.

771
00:55:21,101 --> 00:55:23,365
We've got to help these people
find the Key.

772
00:55:23,436 --> 00:55:25,870
- Are you well enough to go with us?
- Go with you?

773
00:55:25,939 --> 00:55:29,102
Tell us where that policeman was headed
and we'll take it from there.

774
00:55:29,175 --> 00:55:30,164
Kevin, please.

775
00:55:30,377 --> 00:55:32,675
I wish I'd never seen that damn thing.

776
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,206
Okay, look.

777
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:37,713
He said he was going
to Charlie's Music Store.

778
00:55:38,485 --> 00:55:40,248
It's at Landmark Mall.

779
00:55:40,453 --> 00:55:41,943
Can you show us the way?

780
00:55:42,288 --> 00:55:43,414
- Of course!
- No!

781
00:55:53,566 --> 00:55:56,296
Charlie, the kid said you know
about this kind of stuff.

782
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:58,764
You don't think this could be Russian?

783
00:56:14,587 --> 00:56:17,283
What do you know?
The mountain comes to Mohammed.

784
00:56:21,861 --> 00:56:25,388
How come I get this feeling
I've been looking for you all night?

785
00:56:25,732 --> 00:56:28,030
I believe you have something
that belongs to us.

786
00:56:28,101 --> 00:56:30,968
Let me guess. That music gizmo there?

787
00:56:31,104 --> 00:56:32,332
Freeze! All of you!

788
00:56:33,873 --> 00:56:35,568
Choice, really choice.

789
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:37,109
What's this, a circus act?

790
00:56:37,177 --> 00:56:39,202
Someone give me some answers here.

791
00:56:39,279 --> 00:56:42,271
- Let's start with you, Blondie.
- We 're not your enemies.

792
00:56:42,348 --> 00:56:44,908
If you'd just give us that,
we would be very grateful.

793
00:56:45,118 --> 00:56:47,382
You ain't getting nothing,
till I get some answers.

794
00:56:47,454 --> 00:56:50,685
- He-Man, someone's following us!
- What the hell is that?

795
00:56:50,890 --> 00:56:53,757
Neutrino Drive,
18 metrons and closing fast.

796
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:55,521
- It's them.
- At 10!

797
00:56:55,595 --> 00:56:57,187
They've locked in on the Key.

798
00:56:58,031 --> 00:56:59,464
Drop your weapons or I--

799
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:01,367
He-Man!

800
00:57:02,402 --> 00:57:05,530
Gwildor, how long to calculate
the coordinates and take us home?

801
00:57:05,605 --> 00:57:08,403
I don't know.
The keys have all been moved.

802
00:57:08,641 --> 00:57:10,438
Boy, are you people in trouble.

803
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:12,774
He-Man, .61 chromons until moonrise.

804
00:57:12,879 --> 00:57:14,710
Teela, take these people in the back.

805
00:57:14,781 --> 00:57:16,806
- Let's go.
- You can't order me around.

806
00:57:16,883 --> 00:57:20,341
If you'd rather stay and face
Evil-Lyn's commandos, that's fine with me.

807
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:22,650
Believe me, sir, you wouldn't.

808
00:57:26,493 --> 00:57:27,517
Evil-Lyn!

809
00:57:28,328 --> 00:57:30,091
Just as the signal indicated...

810
00:57:30,163 --> 00:57:32,825
...the natives and the Key
are within the structure, but--

811
00:57:32,899 --> 00:57:33,923
Yes, Karg?

812
00:57:34,167 --> 00:57:35,361
He-Man!

813
00:57:36,402 --> 00:57:39,166
The Eternians have already arrived.

814
00:57:39,973 --> 00:57:42,441
Beastman,
full force attack at my command.

815
00:57:42,976 --> 00:57:44,375
Karg, Blade...

816
00:57:44,744 --> 00:57:45,836
...follow me.

817
00:57:52,852 --> 00:57:54,217
How do you feel?

818
00:57:54,854 --> 00:57:56,446
I'm feeling a little hungry.

819
00:58:01,528 --> 00:58:05,658
- Gwildor, you've got to hurry.
- Yes, I'm working as fast as I can.

820
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:08,868
There.

821
00:58:10,336 --> 00:58:13,271
There's Greyskull, and that puts us...

822
00:58:14,407 --> 00:58:15,999
...there, but we have to be...

823
00:58:16,409 --> 00:58:17,433
...there.

824
00:58:17,777 --> 00:58:19,642
Twenty metrons forward...

825
00:58:19,779 --> 00:58:21,474
...if we want to break through...

826
00:58:21,548 --> 00:58:24,847
...the barrier of the Sorceress's force field.

827
00:58:25,285 --> 00:58:27,947
Wait a minute. I don't understand.

828
00:58:28,188 --> 00:58:30,486
Now, what are you trying to do?

829
00:58:31,291 --> 00:58:33,282
The universe is music, Kevin.

830
00:58:34,694 --> 00:58:36,286
This is really weird, huh?

831
00:58:36,629 --> 00:58:38,859
<i>Reminds me of
Invasion of the Body Snatchers.</i>

832
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:42,026
The part where the pods started taking
over people's bodies...

833
00:58:42,101 --> 00:58:44,296
...and you don't know who are the pods
and who are the bodies.

834
00:58:44,370 --> 00:58:45,302
Shut up.

835
00:58:45,838 --> 00:58:47,271
They're psychos, Corrigan.

836
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:50,867
We've stumbled on some
loony fringe group, some kind of cult.

837
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:55,975
Our guests are arriving.

838
00:59:30,917 --> 00:59:32,384
Gwildor, how much longer?

839
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:34,779
I don't know. I don't know.

840
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:37,218
I'd give all the chalconite in Fribillian...

841
00:59:37,323 --> 00:59:40,850
...if I could only spend two units
with a master Songmaker.

842
00:59:48,201 --> 00:59:50,897
- You think they don't like us?
- No, they're just lonely.

843
00:59:50,970 --> 00:59:52,198
They miss us.

844
00:59:53,506 --> 00:59:54,370
Go!

845
01:00:19,198 --> 01:00:20,187
He-Man!

846
01:00:32,845 --> 01:00:35,507
What the hell is going on out there?
World War III?

847
01:00:36,416 --> 01:00:39,544
Aren't those your buddies out there
getting their heads blown off?

848
01:00:40,853 --> 01:00:43,253
Kevin, you know how to use one of these?

849
01:00:43,323 --> 01:00:46,121
Don't let him out of sight.
Guard the Key with your life.

850
01:00:46,192 --> 01:00:48,660
If anyone comes near, blast him.
Do you understand?

851
01:00:58,137 --> 01:00:59,798
They're killing each other out there!

852
01:01:03,609 --> 01:01:04,803
Is Gwildor ready?

853
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:06,674
Not yet. The room's secure.

854
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:09,613
Anyway, it sounded like you needed
a woman's touch out here.

855
01:01:15,421 --> 01:01:16,683
Woman-At-Arms.

856
01:01:17,857 --> 01:01:19,848
Give me the gun, kid.

857
01:01:20,059 --> 01:01:21,151
Come on, give me the gun.

858
01:01:21,494 --> 01:01:23,223
Don't you get it, Lubic?

859
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:25,492
This is for real.

860
01:01:25,798 --> 01:01:27,493
She meant what she said.

861
01:01:27,667 --> 01:01:29,794
- I said, give me the gun.
- No!

862
01:01:30,203 --> 01:01:33,866
Look, we've come this far.
We're not giving up until they get home!

863
01:01:34,674 --> 01:01:36,574
Don't stop, Gwildor.

864
01:01:37,710 --> 01:01:41,476
Don't say I didn't give you a chance.
When this is over, you're going to jail:

865
01:01:41,547 --> 01:01:45,039
Accessory to assault, resisting arrest,
endangering lives.

866
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:50,112
I guarantee, you and all your buddies,
I'm going to put you away for 850 years!

867
01:01:50,990 --> 01:01:52,890
What are you looking at, Shorty?

868
01:01:54,060 --> 01:01:56,995
Mark my words, Corrigan,
you're going to jail, you hear me?

869
01:01:57,063 --> 01:01:59,531
Yeah, Lubic, I hear you.
Lubic, listen to me.

870
01:02:11,043 --> 01:02:12,442
Just relax, okay?

871
01:02:13,045 --> 01:02:16,173
- Gwildor, you need anything?
- Give me that thing!

872
01:02:17,750 --> 01:02:19,342
Kevin, stop it!

873
01:02:23,156 --> 01:02:25,647
Watch that gun! You're going to get hurt!

874
01:02:43,309 --> 01:02:44,105
Mother?

875
01:02:44,210 --> 01:02:45,609
Yes, darling, it's me.

876
01:02:46,379 --> 01:02:47,505
But the plane...

877
01:02:47,980 --> 01:02:50,540
I'm so sorry
you had to go through that, Julie...

878
01:02:50,683 --> 01:02:52,150
...but we had to disappear.

879
01:02:52,485 --> 01:02:54,851
We're doing very important,
very secret work.

880
01:02:55,221 --> 01:02:57,382
Honey, I've missed you so much!

881
01:03:03,896 --> 01:03:05,363
I don't believe it!

882
01:03:06,365 --> 01:03:07,229
Mom.

883
01:03:08,134 --> 01:03:09,226
Listen, darling.

884
01:03:09,302 --> 01:03:11,930
Your new friends are tied up
with the work we're doing...

885
01:03:12,004 --> 01:03:14,029
...and they have something we want.

886
01:03:14,106 --> 01:03:15,630
That shiny metal thing...

887
01:03:15,908 --> 01:03:17,705
...with the blinking lights.

888
01:03:17,777 --> 01:03:19,404
Will you get it for us?

889
01:03:21,214 --> 01:03:22,203
Charlie!

890
01:03:24,250 --> 01:03:25,114
Charlie!

891
01:03:32,458 --> 01:03:33,720
You moron kid!

892
01:03:33,926 --> 01:03:35,518
What's wrong with you?

893
01:03:39,031 --> 01:03:40,225
I don't believe it!

894
01:03:40,299 --> 01:03:43,791
I've got a lot of serious work to do!
You're acting like Torktums!

895
01:03:46,339 --> 01:03:48,170
Julie. Where's Julie?

896
01:03:49,475 --> 01:03:51,409
Kevin, you won't believe this.

897
01:03:51,811 --> 01:03:52,835
They're alive!

898
01:03:53,045 --> 01:03:55,013
What's the matter with you?
Where were you?

899
01:03:59,218 --> 01:04:00,048
Julie!

900
01:04:03,022 --> 01:04:04,148
The Key! The Key!

901
01:04:13,799 --> 01:04:15,494
Thank you, my darling.

902
01:04:17,503 --> 01:04:18,470
No!

903
01:04:19,972 --> 01:04:20,961
Julie!

904
01:04:39,859 --> 01:04:41,156
Where are they going?

905
01:04:43,563 --> 01:04:44,757
Teela! He-Man!

906
01:04:44,830 --> 01:04:45,797
Hurry!

907
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:49,189
The Key.

908
01:04:49,535 --> 01:04:51,332
- That way.
- Bring Gwildor!

909
01:04:52,204 --> 01:04:53,364
Hold them!

910
01:04:54,740 --> 01:04:55,604
Down!

911
01:05:02,782 --> 01:05:05,046
- That woman took the Key!
- Let's move!

912
01:05:06,252 --> 01:05:07,514
Gwildor, come on!

913
01:05:07,687 --> 01:05:09,552
I'm going! I'm going!

914
01:05:14,327 --> 01:05:16,318
Charlie, you got a gun in here?

915
01:05:17,063 --> 01:05:19,031
A gun, a gun! For holdups.

916
01:05:19,098 --> 01:05:22,659
- In the front room, under the counter.
- You got one? Go. Let's go.

917
01:05:24,971 --> 01:05:25,960
Oh, my God.

918
01:05:26,505 --> 01:05:27,494
My store...

919
01:05:28,407 --> 01:05:29,374
...my keyboards...

920
01:05:29,442 --> 01:05:31,740
Look at this place. Look at those guys.

921
01:05:32,144 --> 01:05:34,442
This is an invasion. Give me the gun.

922
01:05:35,181 --> 01:05:37,308
Give me the gun!

923
01:05:40,086 --> 01:05:41,451
Stay right there!

924
01:05:41,988 --> 01:05:42,955
No problem.

925
01:05:45,791 --> 01:05:47,588
Police! Nobody move!

926
01:06:02,408 --> 01:06:03,466
Holy shit!

927
01:06:04,510 --> 01:06:06,705
I think I'm going to need some backup.

928
01:06:15,454 --> 01:06:16,921
Ready to transport.

929
01:06:17,590 --> 01:06:19,751
I will send the signal to Skeletor.

930
01:06:36,776 --> 01:06:38,141
What's happening?

931
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:39,734
Hurry, keep moving!

932
01:06:41,914 --> 01:06:44,474
The Key. Someone's opening a door.

933
01:06:45,051 --> 01:06:47,178
A very big door!

934
01:06:47,253 --> 01:06:49,312
- Cover your eyes!
- What's that?

935
01:06:49,388 --> 01:06:52,186
- This way, hurry!
- Into the alleyway, hurry!

936
01:06:52,291 --> 01:06:54,191
- Let's go!
- By the Sorceress!

937
01:06:54,627 --> 01:06:55,457
Come on!

938
01:06:56,796 --> 01:06:58,058
It's him!

939
01:08:06,398 --> 01:08:07,763
Contact Evil-Lyn.

940
01:08:10,669 --> 01:08:13,194
<i>Evil-Lyn, Skeletor demands a report.</i>

941
01:08:19,678 --> 01:08:21,373
I have the Key, my Lord.

942
01:08:22,414 --> 01:08:24,006
The natives are fools.

943
01:08:24,450 --> 01:08:26,748
Weak, and easily controlled.

944
01:08:26,819 --> 01:08:28,184
- They are--
- And He-Man?

945
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:30,481
He has eluded us.

946
01:08:31,056 --> 01:08:32,353
That will be all.

947
01:08:35,494 --> 01:08:37,894
Air Centurians, find him!

948
01:08:45,538 --> 01:08:46,766
Come on!

949
01:08:48,607 --> 01:08:49,574
Hurry!

950
01:08:49,775 --> 01:08:50,901
Air Centurians!

951
01:08:51,277 --> 01:08:52,141
Down!

952
01:09:03,122 --> 01:09:05,852
- Quick, he'll be back!
- All right, let's move! Come on!

953
01:09:09,728 --> 01:09:11,525
- Come on!
- They're coming.

954
01:09:12,031 --> 01:09:13,293
- This way!
- Hurry!

955
01:09:17,269 --> 01:09:18,497
- On the roof!
- Hurry!

956
01:09:18,571 --> 01:09:20,004
Go! Go!

957
01:09:26,612 --> 01:09:29,137
- They're turning around to come back!
- Keep moving!

958
01:09:34,486 --> 01:09:36,613
Gwildor, your grappler, give it to me.

959
01:09:36,689 --> 01:09:37,883
There, on the roof!

960
01:09:39,992 --> 01:09:42,290
Hurry! Go!

961
01:09:59,645 --> 01:10:02,170
- Where's He-Man?
- There!

962
01:10:39,451 --> 01:10:40,213
Fire!

963
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:45,184
He must not use that Key.

964
01:11:46,418 --> 01:11:48,352
Centurian, lead him to me.

965
01:11:50,222 --> 01:11:51,689
What do you say, Gwildor?

966
01:11:51,857 --> 01:11:54,621
Any signal from the Key?
There's got to be something!

967
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:56,853
Unfortunately, no.

968
01:11:57,162 --> 01:11:58,151
Nothing!

969
01:11:59,665 --> 01:12:01,257
He should be here by now.

970
01:12:01,333 --> 01:12:04,700
I'm not worried about He-Man.
He knows how to take care of himself.

971
01:12:04,770 --> 01:12:08,171
I'm more worried about
getting us out of here before they find us.

972
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:10,674
I only have two numbers left.

973
01:12:11,043 --> 01:12:14,308
Once we get the Key back,
we'll be gone within two pretons.

974
01:12:15,114 --> 01:12:17,548
I think not, Gwildor.

975
01:12:26,692 --> 01:12:30,287
Not the way to treat your beloved ruler.

976
01:12:31,163 --> 01:12:34,621
Throw down your weapons or you die.

977
01:12:47,713 --> 01:12:48,873
Gwildor...

978
01:12:49,681 --> 01:12:51,444
...you minute minion.

979
01:12:51,984 --> 01:12:54,475
I have you to thank for all these troubles.

980
01:12:54,586 --> 01:12:55,450
Why?

981
01:12:55,788 --> 01:12:58,484
I had such grand plans for you.

982
01:12:58,557 --> 01:13:03,392
I would never knowingly serve
the Lord of Snake Mountain.

983
01:13:04,129 --> 01:13:05,824
Wait till He-Man arrives.

984
01:13:06,265 --> 01:13:07,459
He'll see to you!

985
01:13:08,167 --> 01:13:09,156
Really?

986
01:13:09,902 --> 01:13:11,995
I expect him at any moment.

987
01:13:12,504 --> 01:13:13,596
Take them!

988
01:13:35,861 --> 01:13:36,793
Torktums!

989
01:13:52,478 --> 01:13:54,776
He-Man, no! It's a trap!

990
01:13:56,548 --> 01:13:57,480
Julie!

991
01:14:02,788 --> 01:14:03,618
No!

992
01:14:04,990 --> 01:14:05,957
Kevin!

993
01:14:43,028 --> 01:14:44,859
Stay where you are, He-Man!

994
01:14:45,864 --> 01:14:47,263
One more move...

995
01:14:47,633 --> 01:14:50,625
...and your friends will not live
to see another day.

996
01:14:53,438 --> 01:14:54,962
It's going to be all right.

997
01:14:57,342 --> 01:14:58,832
I give you a choice.

998
01:14:59,678 --> 01:15:02,909
Return with me to Eternia as my slave...

999
01:15:03,081 --> 01:15:05,174
...and save their despicable lives...

1000
01:15:05,417 --> 01:15:09,820
...or perish with them
on this primitive and tasteless planet.

1001
01:15:11,423 --> 01:15:13,687
Surrender your sword!

1002
01:15:20,599 --> 01:15:21,588
He-Man, no!

1003
01:15:23,402 --> 01:15:25,097
Teela, I have no choice.

1004
01:15:25,504 --> 01:15:26,903
This is our fight.

1005
01:15:27,506 --> 01:15:29,371
I don't want innocent people to die.

1006
01:15:29,541 --> 01:15:31,202
Well said, He-Man.

1007
01:15:32,844 --> 01:15:33,776
How noble.

1008
01:15:38,850 --> 01:15:40,078
Take care of them.

1009
01:15:40,419 --> 01:15:41,647
Good journey.

1010
01:15:42,487 --> 01:15:43,715
Good journey.

1011
01:15:49,561 --> 01:15:51,085
What about them, sir?

1012
01:15:54,700 --> 01:15:56,065
Leave them alone.

1013
01:15:57,736 --> 01:15:59,499
He-Man is my slave.

1014
01:15:59,805 --> 01:16:02,831
As long as I let them live
he is bound by his word.

1015
01:16:03,008 --> 01:16:04,407
Let them rot.

1016
01:16:06,044 --> 01:16:07,409
Let them rot.

1017
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:16,919
Let me look at her, Kevin.

1018
01:16:16,989 --> 01:16:20,618
- What's wrong with her?
- This is Skeletor's particular gift.

1019
01:16:20,826 --> 01:16:23,317
- Gwildor, we need to get back to Eternia.
- Immediately.

1020
01:16:23,395 --> 01:16:27,092
There's little chance of that.
The power core's melted down.

1021
01:16:27,532 --> 01:16:30,592
The tones are erased
from the Key's memory.

1022
01:16:32,471 --> 01:16:35,269
There's no way home. No way.

1023
01:16:52,324 --> 01:16:53,313
Here...

1024
01:16:53,558 --> 01:16:55,150
...cover her with this.

1025
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:56,327
Teela?

1026
01:16:56,628 --> 01:16:58,220
She's burning up.

1027
01:16:58,330 --> 01:17:01,231
We've got to get her some water.
There's a fountain down below.

1028
01:17:01,300 --> 01:17:02,198
Good.

1029
01:17:10,742 --> 01:17:11,834
Okay, let's go!

1030
01:17:11,910 --> 01:17:15,778
- I'll 'take the west perimeter.
- Unit 3, keep coming from there!

1031
01:17:15,847 --> 01:17:17,109
Okay, Lubic.

1032
01:17:17,349 --> 01:17:19,442
- Where's the army?
- Will you shut up!

1033
01:17:19,785 --> 01:17:23,983
They were here I'm telling you.
It was the damnedest thing you ever saw.

1034
01:17:24,423 --> 01:17:27,256
- Everybody, follow me.
- Let's go, guys.

1035
01:17:32,731 --> 01:17:34,096
Let me see this.

1036
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:42,966
Oh, my God.

1037
01:17:49,715 --> 01:17:53,242
- What's going to happen to her?
- The poison's already in her blood, Kevin.

1038
01:17:53,318 --> 01:17:56,810
- The wound will keep growing...
- Only our Sorceress can heal her now.

1039
01:17:56,888 --> 01:17:58,253
I'm sorry, Kevin.

1040
01:18:02,027 --> 01:18:04,996
Don't be sorry,
just find a way to get us back.

1041
01:18:05,664 --> 01:18:07,689
I mean, there's got to be a way.

1042
01:18:09,634 --> 01:18:10,566
Isn't there?

1043
01:18:15,474 --> 01:18:16,463
Gwildor?

1044
01:18:19,277 --> 01:18:20,175
No.

1045
01:18:21,646 --> 01:18:23,113
You see, Kevin...

1046
01:18:23,982 --> 01:18:27,645
...opening a dimensional door
is relatively easy.

1047
01:18:28,553 --> 01:18:30,350
But the tones, Kevin...

1048
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:34,324
...the tones that were stored
in this Cosmic Key...

1049
01:18:34,593 --> 01:18:36,322
...were completely erased.

1050
01:18:36,428 --> 01:18:38,191
Skeletor knew what he was doing.

1051
01:18:38,764 --> 01:18:42,325
Even if I could fix it,
we could search for a thousand years...

1052
01:18:42,401 --> 01:18:45,336
...and never find the tones
that would take us home.

1053
01:18:45,971 --> 01:18:48,064
But wait a minute. The tones?

1054
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:51,632
You mean the melody the Key played
every time we pressed the red button?

1055
01:18:53,412 --> 01:18:54,674
Wait a minute.

1056
01:18:57,282 --> 01:18:58,647
What is it, Kevin?

1057
01:19:04,022 --> 01:19:06,286
God, I wish that thing would shut up.

1058
01:19:10,095 --> 01:19:11,062
Thanks.

1059
01:19:21,273 --> 01:19:23,741
Wait a minute, I've got it. I've got it.

1060
01:19:29,514 --> 01:19:31,982
That's it! How did you do that?

1061
01:19:33,251 --> 01:19:37,187
If I hear a tune a couple of times,
I can usually remember it.

1062
01:19:37,756 --> 01:19:40,554
It had a good hook.
I was going to use it in one if my songs.

1063
01:19:40,625 --> 01:19:41,683
Songs?

1064
01:19:41,993 --> 01:19:44,461
Why didn't you tell me
you were a Songmaker?

1065
01:19:44,563 --> 01:19:45,928
Are you a master?

1066
01:19:46,131 --> 01:19:49,032
Yes, you are. I know that.

1067
01:19:50,802 --> 01:19:52,770
That's why the Fates brought us here.

1068
01:19:53,438 --> 01:19:55,133
The final chord, Kevin.

1069
01:19:55,574 --> 01:19:57,701
Twenty metrons poleward.

1070
01:19:59,144 --> 01:20:00,805
Pull it out of the air for us.

1071
01:20:07,686 --> 01:20:09,551
You've got the wrong Songmaker.

1072
01:20:09,955 --> 01:20:13,049
I'm just a stupid keyboard player
in a high school band.

1073
01:20:13,258 --> 01:20:14,953
There's a million of me.

1074
01:20:18,964 --> 01:20:20,659
Only one of you, Kevin.

1075
01:20:21,766 --> 01:20:23,461
Only one of anybody.

1076
01:20:27,072 --> 01:20:28,471
Listen to me, boy.

1077
01:20:29,107 --> 01:20:30,597
In half a chromon...

1078
01:20:30,876 --> 01:20:33,470
...we're not going to have a sorceress
to go home to.

1079
01:20:33,545 --> 01:20:37,037
So if you know how to do something
with that thing, then you do it.

1080
01:20:38,783 --> 01:20:42,981
Gwildor, Kevin knows the tones.
Can you get us home or can't you?

1081
01:20:47,926 --> 01:20:48,858
Yes.

1082
01:20:50,061 --> 01:20:51,722
Yes, I think I can.

1083
01:20:53,865 --> 01:20:55,355
I need a few things.

1084
01:20:56,201 --> 01:20:58,169
A bossonic tesseract.

1085
01:20:58,503 --> 01:20:59,492
Right here.

1086
01:20:59,571 --> 01:21:01,539
An octode rectifier.

1087
01:21:01,673 --> 01:21:03,197
I have an octode rectifier.

1088
01:21:03,341 --> 01:21:07,141
- And something to play the tones on.
- I'll get a keyboard from Charlie's.

1089
01:21:08,313 --> 01:21:10,781
- Take care of her.
- I will.

1090
01:21:39,177 --> 01:21:40,075
I win.

1091
01:21:44,215 --> 01:21:45,204
How long?

1092
01:21:45,517 --> 01:21:47,712
Half a preton until moonrise.

1093
01:21:47,953 --> 01:21:50,046
Do you hear, Sorceress?

1094
01:21:51,022 --> 01:21:52,853
The final moment has come.

1095
01:21:53,959 --> 01:21:56,257
All the forces of Greyskull...

1096
01:21:56,328 --> 01:21:59,786
...all the powers of the universe,
will be vested in me!

1097
01:22:00,665 --> 01:22:01,529
Me!

1098
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:05,733
And you will cease to exist.

1099
01:22:06,371 --> 01:22:09,670
It is not too late to undo this madness.

1100
01:22:10,141 --> 01:22:11,369
Madness?

1101
01:22:11,977 --> 01:22:16,880
I demand the destitution,
shame and loneliness of scorn.

1102
01:22:17,482 --> 01:22:20,042
It is my destiny. It is my right.

1103
01:22:20,151 --> 01:22:22,381
Nothing will deter me from it.

1104
01:22:23,021 --> 01:22:25,455
Men who crave power...

1105
01:22:26,191 --> 01:22:29,319
...look back over the mistakes
of their lives...

1106
01:22:29,861 --> 01:22:31,488
...pile them all together...

1107
01:22:31,763 --> 01:22:34,527
...and call it destiny.

1108
01:22:38,236 --> 01:22:41,137
Thank you for that bit of philosophy,
Sorceress.

1109
01:22:41,206 --> 01:22:43,197
Here is my response.

1110
01:22:47,145 --> 01:22:48,840
Yes, Sorceress.

1111
01:22:49,714 --> 01:22:51,079
The sword of Greyskull.

1112
01:22:53,118 --> 01:22:54,142
Mine!

1113
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:04,460
Now, and forever!

1114
01:23:10,301 --> 01:23:11,563
Your champion.

1115
01:23:23,181 --> 01:23:25,308
Witness this moment, He-Man.

1116
01:23:26,351 --> 01:23:28,945
This moment
when the powers of Greyskull...

1117
01:23:29,020 --> 01:23:31,215
...will become mine for eternity.

1118
01:23:31,589 --> 01:23:36,049
Our lifelong battle is ending at last
in the only way it could.

1119
01:23:36,161 --> 01:23:38,061
Holosphere standing by.

1120
01:23:39,330 --> 01:23:41,730
When the Great Eye opens...

1121
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:46,869
...the people of Eternia
shall see you kneeling to me...

1122
01:23:47,005 --> 01:23:48,802
...just before you die.

1123
01:23:49,708 --> 01:23:51,403
I'll never kneel to you!

1124
01:23:51,643 --> 01:23:54,339
Yes, you will! Yes, you will!

1125
01:23:54,979 --> 01:23:59,746
Or I shall reap
unforgettable harm upon you!

1126
01:24:20,638 --> 01:24:23,869
Lubic, let me drive you home
so you can get a little rest.

1127
01:24:25,610 --> 01:24:28,408
I was in Korea.
I never saw anything like this.

1128
01:24:30,248 --> 01:24:31,840
It's him! That's him!

1129
01:24:31,950 --> 01:24:33,383
Not again.

1130
01:24:33,885 --> 01:24:35,352
Come on, we're moving in.

1131
01:24:49,467 --> 01:24:50,491
I got it.

1132
01:24:51,369 --> 01:24:53,269
- How is she?
- The same, Kevin.

1133
01:24:53,438 --> 01:24:55,770
This should give us the tones we need.

1134
01:24:55,907 --> 01:24:56,839
How?

1135
01:24:57,609 --> 01:24:58,940
Just press the keys.

1136
01:24:59,077 --> 01:25:01,272
Keys? What keys?

1137
01:25:02,247 --> 01:25:03,908
No, no, no. Here.

1138
01:25:08,286 --> 01:25:09,412
Excellent!

1139
01:25:15,727 --> 01:25:17,217
Wonderful!

1140
01:25:18,029 --> 01:25:21,021
You never told me you had
sonic keys in this world.

1141
01:25:21,232 --> 01:25:22,597
I just hope it helps, Gwildor.

1142
01:25:22,667 --> 01:25:24,635
- Thank you, Kevin.
- It's okay.

1143
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:31,533
I'll have this ready in a preton.

1144
01:25:33,411 --> 01:25:35,436
Kevin, please don't leave me.

1145
01:25:37,515 --> 01:25:39,142
I promise you, Julie...

1146
01:25:41,119 --> 01:25:42,814
...I'll never leave you.

1147
01:25:44,255 --> 01:25:45,153
Never.

1148
01:25:51,729 --> 01:25:52,991
I love you.

1149
01:25:56,267 --> 01:25:57,393
I love you.

1150
01:26:05,410 --> 01:26:06,399
Enough.

1151
01:26:09,214 --> 01:26:10,841
Where is your strength?

1152
01:26:11,316 --> 01:26:12,681
Where has it gone?

1153
01:26:13,151 --> 01:26:14,880
Look at your precious Sorceress.

1154
01:26:15,153 --> 01:26:18,281
An old crone. Weak. Withering.

1155
01:26:18,990 --> 01:26:19,979
Dying.

1156
01:26:21,826 --> 01:26:24,056
Are you ready to kneel now...

1157
01:26:24,629 --> 01:26:26,494
...proud warrior?

1158
01:26:26,898 --> 01:26:28,763
The moon rises to its apex.

1159
01:26:32,370 --> 01:26:33,530
Do you hear?

1160
01:26:37,075 --> 01:26:39,509
The alpha and the omega.

1161
01:26:40,445 --> 01:26:42,606
Death and rebirth...

1162
01:26:43,281 --> 01:26:45,647
...and as you die...

1163
01:26:46,451 --> 01:26:51,252
...so will I be reborn!

1164
01:27:01,532 --> 01:27:03,363
What're they doing over there?

1165
01:27:03,701 --> 01:27:05,396
We've got to stop this fast.

1166
01:27:07,472 --> 01:27:09,940
Stay here and cover me. Spread out.

1167
01:27:10,041 --> 01:27:12,168
- And wait for my signal.
- Yes, sir.

1168
01:27:13,044 --> 01:27:14,807
These guys are mine.

1169
01:27:17,849 --> 01:27:19,510
<i>People of Eternia!</i>

1170
01:27:20,585 --> 01:27:24,487
<i>I stand before the Great Eye
of the Galaxy...</i>

1171
01:27:25,390 --> 01:27:28,120
<i>...chosen by destiny...</i>

1172
01:27:28,192 --> 01:27:30,956
<i>...to receive the powers of Greyskull.</i>

1173
01:27:31,930 --> 01:27:35,832
This inevitable moment will transpire
before your eyes...

1174
01:27:36,134 --> 01:27:39,763
...even as He-Man himself
bears witness to it.

1175
01:27:39,938 --> 01:27:41,405
<i>The Eye opens!</i>

1176
01:27:41,706 --> 01:27:45,506
Now I, Skeletor...

1177
01:27:46,911 --> 01:27:49,846
...am Master of the Universe!

1178
01:27:52,984 --> 01:27:54,110
Yes!

1179
01:28:10,501 --> 01:28:11,331
Yes!

1180
01:28:12,503 --> 01:28:13,663
I feel it.

1181
01:28:15,640 --> 01:28:18,006
The power fills me.

1182
01:28:18,977 --> 01:28:19,966
Yes!

1183
01:28:20,979 --> 01:28:22,970
I feel the Universe...

1184
01:28:23,281 --> 01:28:24,509
...within me.

1185
01:28:26,584 --> 01:28:28,848
I am a part of the Cosmos.

1186
01:28:29,187 --> 01:28:30,654
Its energy flows...

1187
01:28:31,055 --> 01:28:32,545
...flows through me.

1188
01:28:36,394 --> 01:28:38,453
Of what consequence are you now?

1189
01:28:38,930 --> 01:28:41,057
This planet, these people...

1190
01:28:41,432 --> 01:28:43,491
...they are nothing to me!

1191
01:28:43,668 --> 01:28:45,533
The Universe is power!

1192
01:28:46,437 --> 01:28:49,804
Pure, unstoppable power!

1193
01:28:49,907 --> 01:28:53,365
And I am the force! I am that power!

1194
01:28:55,680 --> 01:28:58,342
Kneel before your master!

1195
01:29:00,385 --> 01:29:01,579
Fool!

1196
01:29:02,286 --> 01:29:04,948
You are no longer my equal.

1197
01:29:05,923 --> 01:29:07,857
I am more than man.

1198
01:29:08,659 --> 01:29:10,217
More than life!

1199
01:29:10,962 --> 01:29:11,860
I...

1200
01:29:11,963 --> 01:29:12,952
...am...

1201
01:29:14,132 --> 01:29:15,099
...God!

1202
01:29:37,021 --> 01:29:38,113
Now...

1203
01:29:39,323 --> 01:29:41,416
...you will...

1204
01:29:41,826 --> 01:29:42,918
...kneel!

1205
01:29:45,963 --> 01:29:47,430
Kneel!

1206
01:29:49,467 --> 01:29:50,991
Are you ready, Kevin?

1207
01:29:53,337 --> 01:29:55,532
I'm going to set the power.
Now here goes.

1208
01:30:02,413 --> 01:30:04,540
Now, Kevin, now!

1209
01:30:13,624 --> 01:30:15,251
Freeze! Nobody move!

1210
01:30:15,460 --> 01:30:16,859
You're all under arrest!

1211
01:30:17,061 --> 01:30:19,586
Throw down your weapons,
place your hands on your heads!

1212
01:30:19,664 --> 01:30:23,259
- You have the right to remain silent--
- Lubic, you don't understand!

1213
01:30:23,434 --> 01:30:26,164
- We've got to get back.
- Nobody's going anywhere!

1214
01:30:32,677 --> 01:30:33,974
Where are they?

1215
01:30:35,213 --> 01:30:37,704
Where are your friends now?

1216
01:30:39,217 --> 01:30:42,744
Tell me about the loneliness of good,
He-Man.

1217
01:30:43,521 --> 01:30:44,783
Is it equal...

1218
01:30:44,989 --> 01:30:47,219
...to the loneliness of evil?

1219
01:31:12,283 --> 01:31:13,307
Holy shit!

1220
01:31:13,584 --> 01:31:16,144
- We did it!
- Gwildor, get down!

1221
01:31:16,220 --> 01:31:17,209
Destroy them!

1222
01:31:18,356 --> 01:31:19,482
Take cover!

1223
01:31:28,166 --> 01:31:30,828
- You promised not to hurt them!
- I lied.

1224
01:31:31,702 --> 01:31:33,897
Farewell, He-Man.

1225
01:31:36,240 --> 01:31:37,298
Lock him!

1226
01:31:39,577 --> 01:31:41,670
Get him! Get him!

1227
01:31:42,547 --> 01:31:45,277
Give He-Man some cover action.
Kevin, watch the rear!

1228
01:31:45,349 --> 01:31:47,749
You! Watch the forward position!

1229
01:31:47,885 --> 01:31:50,752
Will somebody tell me
what the hell's going on around here?

1230
01:31:50,821 --> 01:31:52,948
I feel like I'm in the twilight zone.

1231
01:31:53,024 --> 01:31:56,289
Lubic, this is for real. Just get down!

1232
01:31:58,896 --> 01:32:01,228
Nobody takes pot shots at Lubic!

1233
01:32:01,799 --> 01:32:04,768
All right, freakos, you want to play games?
Then let's play!

1234
01:32:08,339 --> 01:32:09,829
Come on, you mother!

1235
01:32:18,749 --> 01:32:21,149
No! Don't kill him! I want him alive!

1236
01:33:11,135 --> 01:33:13,194
You cannot hide from me!

1237
01:33:41,232 --> 01:33:42,529
Karg, prepare the battle station.

1238
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:45,125
Surely you won't leave
with Skeletor still...

1239
01:33:45,903 --> 01:33:46,892
Yes.

1240
01:33:47,238 --> 01:33:48,637
Warlord, let's go.

1241
01:33:50,474 --> 01:33:51,668
Signal the retreat.

1242
01:34:01,919 --> 01:34:02,749
No!

1243
01:34:12,630 --> 01:34:15,428
I have the power!

1244
01:34:19,637 --> 01:34:20,604
You!

1245
01:34:21,339 --> 01:34:25,571
You will no longer stand
between me and my destiny!

1246
01:34:25,643 --> 01:34:26,803
But I will!

1247
01:34:27,311 --> 01:34:29,711
I told you it was always been between us.

1248
01:34:29,880 --> 01:34:33,714
I ache to smash you out of existence!

1249
01:34:33,884 --> 01:34:37,342
To drive your cursed face
from my memory forever!

1250
01:34:37,421 --> 01:34:42,358
- Enough talk!
- Yes! Let this be our final battle!

1251
01:35:40,284 --> 01:35:41,376
Skeletor...

1252
01:35:45,723 --> 01:35:46,712
...it's over.

1253
01:35:47,091 --> 01:35:48,080
Yes.

1254
01:35:51,195 --> 01:35:52,184
For you!

1255
01:36:31,101 --> 01:36:32,193
He did it!

1256
01:36:32,636 --> 01:36:33,625
He-Man!

1257
01:36:34,104 --> 01:36:35,264
Victory!

1258
01:36:35,339 --> 01:36:36,397
Victory!

1259
01:36:45,082 --> 01:36:46,071
Victory.

1260
01:36:48,819 --> 01:36:50,480
Lubic, look at you.

1261
01:36:51,322 --> 01:36:52,914
So you're really going to stay here?

1262
01:36:52,990 --> 01:36:55,356
Are you kidding?
What am I going back there for?

1263
01:36:55,426 --> 01:36:58,190
And look what I got here. I got a castle.

1264
01:36:58,662 --> 01:37:01,790
I got a view, I got clean air,
I got a beautiful woman.

1265
01:37:03,901 --> 01:37:05,596
Some kind of retirement, huh?

1266
01:37:11,942 --> 01:37:13,807
Julie, keep this with you...

1267
01:37:14,445 --> 01:37:16,811
...and Eternia will always be near.

1268
01:37:20,651 --> 01:37:21,743
Thank you.

1269
01:37:24,221 --> 01:37:26,246
I guess this is really goodbye?

1270
01:37:28,158 --> 01:37:29,147
He-Man...

1271
01:37:30,294 --> 01:37:32,125
...Teela, Man-At-Arms.

1272
01:37:32,196 --> 01:37:34,289
Don't. Don't say goodbye.

1273
01:37:36,567 --> 01:37:38,034
Say, "Good journey."

1274
01:37:40,738 --> 01:37:42,831
There's an old Eternian saying:

1275
01:37:43,707 --> 01:37:45,231
"Live the journey...

1276
01:37:45,309 --> 01:37:48,039
"...for every destination
is but a doorway to another."

1277
01:37:49,880 --> 01:37:50,869
Good journey.

1278
01:37:55,152 --> 01:37:56,380
Good journey.

1279
01:38:04,595 --> 01:38:05,960
Take care, Julie.

1280
01:38:07,898 --> 01:38:10,093
- You look after her, now.
- I will.

1281
01:38:10,601 --> 01:38:12,228
Activate the Doorway, Gwildor.

1282
01:38:13,137 --> 01:38:16,834
Are you sure you don't want to go back
in your planet's history?

1283
01:38:17,174 --> 01:38:19,904
I could take you back in time
to the past or future.

1284
01:38:20,077 --> 01:38:22,671
No. Look, Gwildor, that's okay.
Just send us home.

1285
01:38:22,746 --> 01:38:24,304
We better get home, Gwildor.

1286
01:38:39,063 --> 01:38:42,931
- Good journey, Julie.
- Good journey, Gwildor.

1287
01:38:49,707 --> 01:38:51,106
Good journey!

1288
01:39:00,150 --> 01:39:02,141
Gwildor! Wait! Send us back--

1289
01:39:48,599 --> 01:39:49,759
Mom! Dad!

1290
01:39:50,234 --> 01:39:52,759
- You're up bright and early.
- You're all right!

1291
01:39:52,836 --> 01:39:54,463
What's this all about?

1292
01:39:54,772 --> 01:39:57,502
I love you both so much.
I don't ever want to lose you.

1293
01:39:57,574 --> 01:40:00,372
We're just going away for the day.
We'll be back tonight.

1294
01:40:00,477 --> 01:40:01,307
No!

1295
01:40:02,046 --> 01:40:05,447
I changed my mind. I really do want to go
to the beach with you today.

1296
01:40:05,516 --> 01:40:06,983
Don't go to Catalina, okay?

1297
01:40:07,051 --> 01:40:09,246
Don't be silly, honey.
Stay home and study.

1298
01:40:09,386 --> 01:40:10,978
Mom, Dad, please!

1299
01:40:11,922 --> 01:40:13,856
Don't get on that plane today.

1300
01:40:14,858 --> 01:40:16,382
I have a terrible feeling.

1301
01:40:16,460 --> 01:40:19,361
But Julie, your father's an excellent pilot.
It's a short trip.

1302
01:40:19,430 --> 01:40:20,260
No!

1303
01:40:22,933 --> 01:40:24,161
Julie! Julie!

1304
01:40:24,802 --> 01:40:26,929
- Put those keys back.
- I love you.

1305
01:40:27,004 --> 01:40:29,495
Julie, where are you going?
Come back here.

1306
01:40:33,243 --> 01:40:34,403
Julie!

1307
01:40:34,912 --> 01:40:35,901
Kevin!

1308
01:40:42,419 --> 01:40:45,911
- Don't let your parents get on that plane.
- I already stopped them.

1309
01:40:47,257 --> 01:40:48,383
Wait a minute.

1310
01:40:49,493 --> 01:40:50,653
You know?

1311
01:40:53,897 --> 01:40:55,626
We were there.

1312
01:41:00,838 --> 01:41:02,032
Eternia.

1313
01:41:13,083 --> 01:41:16,416
I have the power!

1314
01:45:22,432 --> 01:45:23,899
I'll be back.

1315
01:45:24,899 --> 01:45:34,899
