1
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:25,324
Eat me, asshole.

2
00:00:28,411 --> 00:00:30,163
Careful, now.

3
00:00:30,413 --> 00:00:33,666
Come on, bird. Come on.

4
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:34,959
Please, baby.

5
00:00:35,209 --> 00:00:35,918
Dickhead.

6
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:39,380
See Daddy smiling?

7
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:40,465
Come on.

8
00:00:40,715 --> 00:00:44,552
Bring your feathery ass here. Come on.

9
00:01:17,752 --> 00:01:20,171
-Explosion caused that?
-No.

10
00:01:20,421 --> 00:01:26,094
Nothing in here could've blown
with enough force to move that damn sub.

11
00:01:26,344 --> 00:01:28,638
Whatever. It's junk.

12
00:01:28,888 --> 00:01:34,685
We could all just dive in
and see who makes it to the top.

13
00:01:36,646 --> 00:01:40,066
Isn't that the old Aquatica spirit, Dr. Susie?

14
00:01:40,316 --> 00:01:44,028
Just dive in.

15
00:01:45,196 --> 00:01:47,365
You could go first, to lead by example.

16
00:01:47,615 --> 00:01:49,158
He was my best friend, Janice.

17
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:50,576
I'm not going in the water.

18
00:01:50,827 --> 00:01:53,746
-No way, man! The sharks are in there.
-Listen!

19
00:01:53,996 --> 00:01:58,167
We put these on. They help
fight hypothermia. That's a start.

20
00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:01,045
And unless someone's got a better idea...

21
00:02:01,295 --> 00:02:04,757
...we're going to have to swim out of here.

22
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:26,988
This isn't happening.

23
00:02:49,677 --> 00:02:53,806
I'm not Daniel when he faced the lion!

24
00:02:58,102 --> 00:03:00,772
So I appreciate the irony, Lord!

25
00:03:01,022 --> 00:03:04,525
"Cook dies in his own oven!"

26
00:03:04,901 --> 00:03:09,238
But I've got other plans!

27
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,070
You ate my bird.

28
00:03:59,956 --> 00:04:00,998
Was that the surface?

29
00:04:01,249 --> 00:04:05,628
No, the vibrations are too deep.
That was from inside.

30
00:04:14,679 --> 00:04:16,139
I wouldn't get that close.

31
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:18,266
Just a suggestion.

32
00:04:18,516 --> 00:04:21,185
Water's murky. We might make it.

33
00:04:21,436 --> 00:04:25,356
No way! No, we won't!

34
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:28,151
It's 230 feet...

35
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:32,071
...from the lagoon floor
to the lagoon surface!

36
00:04:32,321 --> 00:04:35,033
The average human swims
two feet per second.

37
00:04:35,283 --> 00:04:38,327
The average shark swims
50 feet per second.

38
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:41,748
There's no way I'm getting into that pool!

39
00:04:41,998 --> 00:04:45,043
What we have here is
your basic maintenance ladder.

40
00:04:45,293 --> 00:04:47,086
This leads up to the surface.

41
00:04:47,336 --> 00:04:50,381
I love you, Scoggs. I really do!

42
00:04:50,631 --> 00:04:53,676
Why do I feel a "but" coming on?

43
00:04:53,718 --> 00:04:56,596
But we don't know what shape
the surface level is in.

44
00:04:56,846 --> 00:04:58,264
The shaft is air-locked.

45
00:04:58,514 --> 00:05:01,601
But if the explosion breached the shaft
at surface level...

46
00:05:01,851 --> 00:05:04,437
...we won't have enough pressure
to stabilize the wet pool.

47
00:05:04,687 --> 00:05:09,108
If the pool isn't stabilized,
there's tons of ocean dying to get in.

48
00:05:09,358 --> 00:05:11,402
You'll bring the whole facility down.

49
00:05:11,652 --> 00:05:13,488
We're better off with the sharks.

50
00:05:13,738 --> 00:05:16,074
You want to swim with your fishes?
Go ahead!

51
00:05:16,324 --> 00:05:18,659
I'm opening this door
and climbing out of here!

52
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:21,579
-The hell you are!
-I don't work for you anymore!

53
00:05:21,829 --> 00:05:23,790
-I don't have to take orders!
-Enough!

54
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:28,211
That's enough now, from all of you!

55
00:05:30,755 --> 00:05:32,673
You think water's fast?

56
00:05:32,924 --> 00:05:37,428
You should see ice.
It moves like it has a mind.

57
00:05:37,678 --> 00:05:43,226
Like it knows it killed the world once.
It got a taste for murder.

58
00:05:43,267 --> 00:05:45,228
When the avalanche came...

59
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:48,648
...it took us a week to climb out.

60
00:05:48,898 --> 00:05:53,528
And somewhere we lost hope.

61
00:05:53,861 --> 00:05:57,990
I don't know when we turned
on each other.

62
00:05:58,241 --> 00:05:59,826
I just know...

63
00:06:00,076 --> 00:06:03,663
...that seven of us survived the slide...

64
00:06:03,913 --> 00:06:07,709
...and only five made it out.

65
00:06:08,626 --> 00:06:12,505
Now, we took an oath
that I'm breaking now.

66
00:06:12,755 --> 00:06:16,634
Swore that we'd say it was the snow
that killed the other two.

67
00:06:16,884 --> 00:06:19,011
But it wasn't.

68
00:06:19,262 --> 00:06:22,140
Nature can be lethal.

69
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:26,602
But it doesn't hold a candle to man.

70
00:06:27,729 --> 00:06:32,442
You've seen how bad things can get
and how quick they can get that way.

71
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:35,111
Well, they can get a whole lot worse.

72
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:39,741
So we're not going to fight anymore!

73
00:06:39,991 --> 00:06:45,496
We're going to pull together
and find a way to get out of here!

74
00:06:45,747 --> 00:06:49,751
First, we're going to seal off this pool!

75
00:07:03,264 --> 00:07:06,392
Oh, my God.

76
00:07:15,777 --> 00:07:18,029
It just ate him.

77
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:21,282
It just ate him. Christ!

78
00:07:21,532 --> 00:07:23,242
I'm not moving.

79
00:07:23,493 --> 00:07:25,536
I'm not moving. Someone will come.

80
00:07:25,787 --> 00:07:29,540
They'll come and they'll get us,
and we'll be fine.

81
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,959
No. I'm not moving.

82
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:37,340
Listen, Tom, what is the precise
structural failure limit for Aquatica?

83
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:38,591
3,200 tons.

84
00:07:38,841 --> 00:07:44,555
What happens when we get more
than 3,200 tons of water in this rig?

85
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:50,770
The support struts go first.
Their tolerance is about seven tons.

86
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:53,064
They'll crack like toothpicks.

87
00:07:53,314 --> 00:07:58,444
The walls will buckle. They can't handle
more than 10 tons of pressure.

88
00:08:04,367 --> 00:08:07,787
You want to be here for that?

89
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:16,629
Hell, no.

90
00:08:19,424 --> 00:08:23,386
The moment of truth. Again.

91
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,695
Go! Go! Go!

92
00:09:32,914 --> 00:09:35,625
I got you.

93
00:09:39,629 --> 00:09:42,840
It's burning!

94
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:50,431
The elevator's blocking the top.

95
00:09:50,681 --> 00:09:55,478
If we make it to Level 1,
we can take the stairs out.

96
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:31,305
Let's get out of here!

97
00:10:31,556 --> 00:10:34,684
Go! Go!

98
00:10:36,477 --> 00:10:37,854
What are you doing?

99
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:41,107
If they break through,
water will bring them right to us.

100
00:10:41,357 --> 00:10:44,652
Level 2 is only partially flooded.
If I can get that door open...

101
00:10:44,902 --> 00:10:49,699
...the water will run off there,
buy us some time.

102
00:10:50,908 --> 00:10:52,952
Big, real big.

103
00:10:53,202 --> 00:10:56,748
-What's that?
-The size of your brass balls.

104
00:10:56,998 --> 00:11:00,043
Be careful.

105
00:11:08,051 --> 00:11:10,678
Go!

106
00:12:50,361 --> 00:12:53,364
Jan, stay there!

107
00:12:59,787 --> 00:13:01,205
Get me out of here, Carter!

108
00:13:01,456 --> 00:13:02,999
I don't want to die!

109
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:06,794
Grab my hand! Come on!

110
00:13:06,878 --> 00:13:08,254
I can't!

111
00:13:08,504 --> 00:13:11,382
I can't reach!

112
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:15,803
-Take it!
-I can't reach!

113
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:06,187
Can you reach that door above you?

114
00:14:08,523 --> 00:14:10,817
It's too high.

115
00:14:11,067 --> 00:14:14,112
It's too high.

116
00:14:34,757 --> 00:14:38,636
Sharks probably flooded that level too.

117
00:15:10,168 --> 00:15:13,046
Good thing you came to this side.
The other side's underwater.

118
00:15:13,296 --> 00:15:16,174
-We didn't exactly plan it.
-Yeah, it wasn't planned.

119
00:15:16,424 --> 00:15:19,844
Are you all that made it?

120
00:15:25,141 --> 00:15:26,350
We did it.

121
00:15:26,601 --> 00:15:29,812
We're on Level 1.
We can take the stairs to the surface.

122
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:32,106
The stairs are flooded. Trust me, I know.

123
00:15:32,357 --> 00:15:34,817
Are you sure?

124
00:15:35,068 --> 00:15:39,197
Give us a goddamn break, can't You?

125
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:51,626
He always answers.

126
00:15:51,876 --> 00:15:56,589
Sometimes, the answer you get
isn't the answer you want.

127
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:02,387
We're 60 feet from the surface.

128
00:16:02,637 --> 00:16:06,391
There's an emergency hatch
on this level, right?

129
00:16:06,641 --> 00:16:09,060
This level has bilge pumps on it
for storm runoff.

130
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:14,273
If we re-route the emergency generators,
we could drain a stairway.

131
00:16:14,524 --> 00:16:15,775
You sure?

132
00:16:16,025 --> 00:16:19,195
Who you going to trust?

133
00:16:21,239 --> 00:16:22,782
-You.
-That's right.

134
00:16:23,032 --> 00:16:26,077
You trust me.

135
00:16:34,085 --> 00:16:36,713
We had poker here tomorrow night.

136
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:40,425
She'd always draw to the inside straight
when she could've stuck with a pair.

137
00:16:40,675 --> 00:16:43,720
Big dreams.

138
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:53,730
Even in death: Standards.

139
00:16:54,188 --> 00:16:59,152
Jan was a healthy girl.
Something in here has to run on batteries.

140
00:16:59,402 --> 00:17:03,281
-Nice.
-Where would a girl keep her...

141
00:17:03,531 --> 00:17:04,365
...thing?

142
00:17:04,615 --> 00:17:07,326
What's the matter with you?

143
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:16,502
My skin's starting to hemorrhage.

144
00:17:16,753 --> 00:17:20,214
The sharks smell the blood.

145
00:17:20,465 --> 00:17:21,799
This'll coat it with oil.

146
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:25,845
Look, Carter, what you said down there...

147
00:17:26,095 --> 00:17:29,182
...maybe you were right.

148
00:17:29,432 --> 00:17:32,852
Everything I've done...

149
00:17:33,394 --> 00:17:36,439
...I don't think I could've done it
without you.

150
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:41,986
I know, Susan. That's the problem.

151
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,614
Four a.m.

152
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:45,990
I know.

153
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,369
One night feels like a whole week.

154
00:17:49,619 --> 00:17:51,204
Relativity.

155
00:17:51,454 --> 00:17:52,705
What do you mean?

156
00:17:52,955 --> 00:17:55,625
Einstein's theory of relativity.

157
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:59,587
Grab hold of a hot pan,
a second can seem like an hour.

158
00:17:59,837 --> 00:18:02,173
Put your hands on a hot woman...

159
00:18:02,423 --> 00:18:04,634
...an hour can seem like a second.

160
00:18:04,884 --> 00:18:08,262
It's all relative.

161
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:16,813
I spent four years at Cal Tech. That's
the best physics explanation I've heard.

162
00:18:18,314 --> 00:18:21,150
It works.

163
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:22,819
You stay with the doc.

164
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:25,655
Me and Scoggs are going to try
to get to the wet lab...

165
00:18:25,905 --> 00:18:29,367
...drain that stairwell.

166
00:18:31,536 --> 00:18:34,872
-Preach?
-What?

167
00:18:35,456 --> 00:18:39,168
Would you zip me up, please?

168
00:19:09,073 --> 00:19:11,492
We got one, there's two sharks left...

169
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:14,954
...and you and the doc are doing
a little bathroom love.

170
00:19:15,204 --> 00:19:19,375
They got a pill for what's wrong with you?

171
00:19:28,426 --> 00:19:32,597
I need to get some things
from my quarters. Research data.

172
00:19:32,847 --> 00:19:35,266
The tests, they worked.

173
00:19:35,516 --> 00:19:41,022
So much death around us,
to risk any more life for some numbers....

174
00:19:41,356 --> 00:19:46,110
Without that data, everyone dying
isn't just tragic, it's useless.

175
00:19:46,361 --> 00:19:50,239
Death is always useless, Doctor.

176
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:02,710
This is it.

177
00:20:06,881 --> 00:20:10,510
Stay here. I'll be back before you know it.

178
00:21:20,246 --> 00:21:21,956
What's going on?

179
00:21:22,206 --> 00:21:24,167
What the hell's going on? What is that?

180
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:25,835
It's okay!

181
00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:28,046
-What is that?
-We're all right!

182
00:21:28,296 --> 00:21:32,341
-What the fuck?
-It's okay.

183
00:21:34,343 --> 00:21:36,763
I thought you were coming back for me.

184
00:21:37,013 --> 00:21:39,932
One of your monitors is blocking the panel.

185
00:21:40,183 --> 00:21:42,143
You want to help me move it?

186
00:21:42,393 --> 00:21:46,439
I say we do everything right together.

187
00:21:46,647 --> 00:21:49,275
Right together.

188
00:22:02,246 --> 00:22:04,290
<i>Hello.</i>

189
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:07,251
My name is Sherman Dudley...

190
00:22:07,502 --> 00:22:12,298
...and if this message finds you,
I did not survive, so this is my legacy.

191
00:22:12,548 --> 00:22:16,719
<i>I have loved the pulpit
and I have loved the bottle.</i>

192
00:22:16,969 --> 00:22:21,349
<i>I did my best to be a good husband,
a f ather.</i>

193
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:24,268
I came up wanting.

194
00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:28,022
So what do I have to say to you?

195
00:22:28,272 --> 00:22:32,318
What mark do I have to leave behind?

196
00:22:36,781 --> 00:22:40,034
<i>We'll begin with the perfect omelet,
made with two eggs, not three.</i>

197
00:22:40,284 --> 00:22:44,997
<i>Amateurs often add milk for density.
This is a mistake.</i>

198
00:25:19,027 --> 00:25:21,904
Come on!

199
00:25:53,186 --> 00:25:56,606
I got you. Come on.

200
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:12,121
Damn you, Scoggs.

201
00:26:21,506 --> 00:26:24,550
Where's Susan?

202
00:26:25,635 --> 00:26:26,511
I'm done.

203
00:26:26,761 --> 00:26:31,933
Brothers never make it out
of situations like this. Not ever!

204
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,591
Did you do it?

205
00:30:33,841 --> 00:30:36,844
Where's Scoggins?

206
00:30:38,388 --> 00:30:41,057
I hate to interrupt this moment
of burgeoning intimacy...

207
00:30:41,307 --> 00:30:44,686
...but can we get the fuck out of here?

208
00:30:54,195 --> 00:30:56,030
-Is this the only way?
-Exits are flooded.

209
00:30:56,280 --> 00:31:00,535
Whole place is sinking.
It's this way or no way at all.

210
00:31:00,785 --> 00:31:03,204
You can bring on the good news
anytime now.

211
00:31:03,454 --> 00:31:07,166
Sharks are attracted to churning water,
bright colors.

212
00:31:07,417 --> 00:31:11,087
These extinguishers will be a distraction.

213
00:31:11,337 --> 00:31:12,630
What about us?

214
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,760
The vest'll bring you up too fast.
Your lungs'll pop like a balloon.

215
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:19,971
You weren't the sunny kid in your class.

216
00:31:20,221 --> 00:31:22,807
I never went to class.

217
00:31:23,057 --> 00:31:25,393
How far to the surface? Sixty feet?

218
00:31:25,643 --> 00:31:26,561
There's nothing to it.

219
00:31:26,811 --> 00:31:31,399
Exhale on the way up,
and get the hell out of the water.

220
00:31:31,649 --> 00:31:35,737
I got to equalize the pressure
before we blow the air lock.

221
00:31:35,987 --> 00:31:39,073
I got to let the room fill up with water.

222
00:31:39,323 --> 00:31:42,368
It'll only take a few seconds.

223
00:31:42,618 --> 00:31:44,996
You ready?

224
00:31:45,246 --> 00:31:46,998
No.

225
00:31:47,248 --> 00:31:49,876
Not in the least.

226
00:32:07,393 --> 00:32:10,063
"Though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...

227
00:32:10,313 --> 00:32:11,689
"...I shall fear no evil...

228
00:32:11,939 --> 00:32:13,232
"...for Thou art with me...

229
00:32:13,483 --> 00:32:15,777
"...Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me.

230
00:32:16,027 --> 00:32:20,406
<i>"Surely goodness and mercy shall
follow me all the days of my life... "</i>

231
00:32:20,656 --> 00:32:22,450
<i>...because I carry a big stick...</i>

232
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:25,161
<i>...and I'm the meanest motherfucker
in the valley.</i>

233
00:32:25,411 --> 00:32:28,456
<i>Two sharks down, Lord.
One demon fish to go.</i>

234
00:32:28,706 --> 00:32:29,999
Can I get an "amen"?

235
00:32:30,249 --> 00:32:30,917
Amen!

236
00:32:31,167 --> 00:32:34,170
-I can't hear you!
-Amen!

237
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,588
Give me an "amen"!

238
00:32:35,838 --> 00:32:39,384
-Stay with us, Lord!
-Amen.

239
00:32:40,927 --> 00:32:43,262
Okay, hold on three! Ready?

240
00:32:43,513 --> 00:32:47,183
One! Two! Three!

241
00:34:21,778 --> 00:34:24,572
Swim!

242
00:35:01,067 --> 00:35:03,945
Oh, my God!

243
00:35:40,273 --> 00:35:43,735
It's the devil, you know.

244
00:35:53,536 --> 00:35:57,790
He'll be okay if we can get out of here.

245
00:36:08,301 --> 00:36:09,969
Son of a bitch.

246
00:36:10,219 --> 00:36:11,179
What?

247
00:36:11,429 --> 00:36:17,352
Those fences are titanium underneath,
but on top, they're just plain steel.

248
00:36:18,186 --> 00:36:21,064
They've been herding us,
pushing us where they want.

249
00:36:21,314 --> 00:36:25,193
Using us to flood the facility.

250
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,987
Oh, my God.

251
00:36:28,237 --> 00:36:29,864
That's the answer to the riddle.

252
00:36:30,114 --> 00:36:34,118
Because that's what
an 8,000-pound mako thinks about.

253
00:36:34,369 --> 00:36:37,497
About freedom.

254
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:41,501
About the deep blue sea.

255
00:36:42,919 --> 00:36:46,255
We have to kill her.

256
00:36:47,006 --> 00:36:51,969
That's the first real smart thing
you've said all day.

257
00:36:54,972 --> 00:36:57,767
Here we go.

258
00:37:13,741 --> 00:37:16,828
Let's go.

259
00:37:25,712 --> 00:37:31,008
We ought to get 2.5 sticks of dynamite
out of these flares.

260
00:37:35,012 --> 00:37:37,515
From up here, you ought to be able
to see me spear it.

261
00:37:37,765 --> 00:37:40,309
When I do, you take this end of this cable...

262
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,229
...hook it up to the positive side
of the boat battery.

263
00:37:43,479 --> 00:37:46,399
And boom!

264
00:38:21,642 --> 00:38:23,895
Damn! I can't get her!

265
00:38:24,145 --> 00:38:27,523
She's too far away!

266
00:38:27,815 --> 00:38:29,984
I know how to get her.

267
00:38:30,234 --> 00:38:32,528
How?

268
00:38:32,779 --> 00:38:35,323
Bait.

269
00:38:48,211 --> 00:38:50,713
She may be the smartest animal
in the world...

270
00:38:50,963 --> 00:38:55,009
...but she's still just an animal.

271
00:38:55,009 --> 00:38:57,970
Come to Mama.

272
00:39:10,358 --> 00:39:13,111
No!

273
00:39:15,863 --> 00:39:18,741
Susan, don't!

274
00:39:33,506 --> 00:39:36,718
Get out of the water!

275
00:41:29,706 --> 00:41:31,040
All right, Lord....

276
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:32,792
Shoot it, Preach!

277
00:41:33,042 --> 00:41:34,502
This is for Scoggins.

278
00:41:34,752 --> 00:41:37,422
Shoot it!

279
00:41:42,969 --> 00:41:45,763
Damn!

280
00:41:49,726 --> 00:41:52,186
Blow it, Preach! Blow it!

281
00:41:52,437 --> 00:41:53,604
The battery!

282
00:41:53,855 --> 00:41:56,691
Blow it!

283
00:41:59,277 --> 00:42:02,405
Do it!

284
00:43:03,049 --> 00:43:06,386
Bring me some sushi!

285
00:43:29,909 --> 00:43:31,536
Forty-five-foot shark...

286
00:43:31,786 --> 00:43:33,579
...and you hit me.

287
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:35,581
Nice.

288
00:43:35,832 --> 00:43:40,503
Could've been worse.
I could've let him eat your ass.

289
00:43:46,259 --> 00:43:48,636
Carter, we're sinking, right?

290
00:43:48,886 --> 00:43:50,680
Yeah.

291
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:54,142
Let me ask you something.

292
00:43:54,392 --> 00:43:56,978
Are you sure it was just three sharks?

293
00:43:57,228 --> 00:43:59,856
Yeah.

294
00:44:08,614 --> 00:44:12,035
That's more like it.

295
00:44:18,624 --> 00:44:21,419
Here comes the next shift.

296
00:44:21,669 --> 00:44:23,379
Let me tell you, man...

297
00:44:23,629 --> 00:44:27,008
...I quit this job.

298
00:44:29,635 --> 00:44:32,221
Take me back to the ghetto.

299
00:44:32,472 --> 00:44:35,350
Amen.
