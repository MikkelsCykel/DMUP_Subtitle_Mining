1
00:00:23,897 --> 00:00:27,234
The battle between the Darkness
and the Light has waged eternal,

2
00:00:27,275 --> 00:00:30,570
their armies fueled by
souls harvested on Earth.

3
00:00:30,612 --> 00:00:34,517
The Lord of Darkness, Malebolgia,
has sent a lieutenant...

4
00:00:34,537 --> 00:00:37,786
to recruit men who will
help destroy the world...

5
00:00:37,828 --> 00:00:40,705
in exchange for wealth and power...

6
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,543
and provide enough souls
to complete his army...

7
00:00:44,584 --> 00:00:48,131
and allow Armageddon to begin.

8
00:00:48,727 --> 00:00:52,926
All Malebolgia needs now
is a great soldier,

9
00:00:52,968 --> 00:00:56,633
someone to lead his hordes
to the gates of Heaven...

10
00:00:56,653 --> 00:00:58,390
and burn them down.

11
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:17,946
Like him, I killed in the name of good,

12
00:03:18,611 --> 00:03:22,442
but the violence of my life, pulled
my soul towards the darkness.

13
00:03:23,093 --> 00:03:25,638
But I fought and freed my soul.

14
00:03:27,723 --> 00:03:31,256
Now I watch for others like me.

15
00:03:32,185 --> 00:03:35,044
Men are the ones who
create evil on Earth.

16
00:03:35,207 --> 00:03:38,723
It is the choices they make
that enslave their souls.

17
00:03:40,233 --> 00:03:43,257
This is the test.

18
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:07,401
Josef as-Amifar, the leader of the
Algerian Revolutionary Front...

19
00:06:07,421 --> 00:06:10,642
was killed yesterday along
with 26 innocent civilians...

20
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:13,552
in a vicious rocket attack
at an airport in Hong Kong.

21
00:06:13,813 --> 00:06:16,680
There has been an outpouring
of anti-U. S. sentiments...

22
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,056
sweeping across the globe.

23
00:06:18,575 --> 00:06:19,884
Protesters in Libya,

24
00:06:19,904 --> 00:06:21,495
Bosnia, France, Moscow...

25
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:22,465
and the United States...

26
00:06:22,485 --> 00:06:24,185
are joining together to denounce this....

27
00:06:24,347 --> 00:06:26,131
Simmons is the best.

28
00:06:26,398 --> 00:06:28,192
Simmons is not the problem!

29
00:06:28,352 --> 00:06:30,386
He's overseas killing the bad guys...

30
00:06:30,406 --> 00:06:32,834
Like the hero that he thinks he is.

31
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,667
We made a deal, Wynn.

32
00:06:34,798 --> 00:06:37,538
Where the hell is the ultimate
weapon you promised us?

33
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,512
This isn't a game we're playing.

34
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,268
Engineering a biological
weapon is an exact science.

35
00:06:43,288 --> 00:06:45,805
You want it done right,
you do it my way.

36
00:06:45,825 --> 00:06:48,883
This five-year plan of yours
just chaps my buttocks.

37
00:06:48,924 --> 00:06:51,343
I'm making you a guarantee.

38
00:06:51,385 --> 00:06:54,718
All you have to do is keep
certain agencies off my back...

39
00:06:54,738 --> 00:06:57,152
and make damn sure I get all
that I've been promised.

40
00:06:57,172 --> 00:07:00,519
This is me you're taking to.
If I say you're the man, you're the man.

41
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:03,814
You do for me, and in no time
you'll be running this place.

42
00:07:04,158 --> 00:07:07,276
And when the big piñata
breaks, you'll get it all.

43
00:07:07,433 --> 00:07:10,070
Just make sure you keep
your end of the bargain.

44
00:07:12,414 --> 00:07:13,449
P.S...

45
00:07:13,776 --> 00:07:16,130
There's one more item
on our "to do" list.

46
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:18,605
It requires your personal attention.

47
00:07:18,745 --> 00:07:21,832
We need you to help recruit a
very special soldier for us.

48
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:25,065
Your all-time favorite
killer, Al Simmons.

49
00:07:25,628 --> 00:07:29,229
Simmons? He's doing a
great job where he is.

50
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:30,488
Why do you want him?

51
00:07:30,508 --> 00:07:33,052
Why do you people always question?

52
00:07:33,072 --> 00:07:37,284
Why ask "Why", when "How"
is so much more fun?

53
00:07:47,936 --> 00:07:50,086
Oh... not again.

54
00:07:52,521 --> 00:07:54,314
- Hey, Wanda, do me a favor.
- Yeah?

55
00:07:54,356 --> 00:07:55,691
Buy your man a watch.

56
00:07:55,733 --> 00:07:57,990
He's on his way out.
Do me a favor.

57
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:58,902
What's that?

58
00:07:58,944 --> 00:08:00,704
Make sure he's back for
dinner tomorrow night.

59
00:08:00,724 --> 00:08:01,662
I'll do my best.

60
00:08:01,682 --> 00:08:04,199
Make sure he's back for
dinner, tomorrow night, Terry.

61
00:08:04,241 --> 00:08:05,242
Yes, ma'am.

62
00:08:17,755 --> 00:08:19,089
Hey, Spaz.

63
00:08:19,516 --> 00:08:21,216
Same routine, all right?

64
00:08:21,258 --> 00:08:23,019
Guard the house.
Guard Wanda.

65
00:08:24,219 --> 00:08:25,637
Great guard dog.

66
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:34,058
Here.

67
00:08:37,441 --> 00:08:39,556
Hey, Al, what happened last night?

68
00:08:39,576 --> 00:08:40,731
Look at this.

69
00:08:40,986 --> 00:08:42,780
What a friggin' mess.

70
00:08:42,821 --> 00:08:44,615
We were supposed to be
taking out the bad guys,

71
00:08:44,656 --> 00:08:46,075
not innocent bystanders.

72
00:08:46,453 --> 00:08:48,160
Another Jason Wynn special.

73
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:50,135
What do you mean?

74
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:53,244
Seems like an awful lot of Wynn's
ops have screwed the pooch lately.

75
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,752
Don't worry, Al. Lighten up.
I got your back.

76
00:08:58,921 --> 00:09:00,947
Semper Fi.
Good to go.

77
00:09:02,687 --> 00:09:03,814
All right.

78
00:09:18,732 --> 00:09:20,859
I'm gonna keep my eye on Wynn.

79
00:09:25,989 --> 00:09:27,533
Vehicle secure.

80
00:09:36,667 --> 00:09:40,278
The airport kill zone was supposed
to be clear of civilians.

81
00:09:40,629 --> 00:09:43,632
An unfortunate, but
necessary sacrifice.

82
00:09:43,918 --> 00:09:47,177
You want someone filling
body bags, you send Priest.

83
00:09:47,693 --> 00:09:49,680
If you can't handle it, I will.

84
00:09:52,182 --> 00:09:55,533
I will send whoever,
wherever I choose.

85
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:58,480
You will follow orders,
and do your job.

86
00:09:58,522 --> 00:10:00,023
Got a problem with that, soldier?

87
00:10:00,408 --> 00:10:02,164
Yes, I do, sir...

88
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:04,695
and I want out.

89
00:10:05,988 --> 00:10:08,071
I always knew you'd lose your nerve.

90
00:10:09,324 --> 00:10:11,368
You don't quit us, son.

91
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,829
We are not the U.S. Postal Service.

92
00:10:17,532 --> 00:10:19,793
Have you read your profile recently?

93
00:10:19,835 --> 00:10:22,111
You are a borderline psychopath,

94
00:10:22,346 --> 00:10:24,214
perfect for government service.

95
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:29,053
No guilt, no fear!
You're a killing machine.

96
00:10:30,012 --> 00:10:32,306
- You're wrong about me, Wynn.
- Am I?

97
00:10:33,557 --> 00:10:37,166
Have you ever stopped to consider that
you won't be happy doing anything else?

98
00:10:37,186 --> 00:10:38,979
I made up my mind.

99
00:10:39,021 --> 00:10:41,098
Nothing I can say to
make you change it?

100
00:10:41,699 --> 00:10:42,680
Nothing.

101
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,175
All right.

102
00:10:45,694 --> 00:10:47,212
I'll arrange for your transfer...

103
00:10:47,232 --> 00:10:49,579
right after we've run
this last operation.

104
00:10:50,281 --> 00:10:53,744
North Korean refinery secretly
producing biological weapons.

105
00:10:54,953 --> 00:10:57,159
It's up to us to take out the plant...

106
00:10:57,289 --> 00:11:00,918
and carefully destroy all
the biochemical viruses.

107
00:11:03,393 --> 00:11:05,422
Come on, son.
This is top priority.

108
00:11:09,885 --> 00:11:11,345
Let's get it over with.

109
00:12:26,762 --> 00:12:28,764
What the hell is going on here?

110
00:12:29,184 --> 00:12:29,991
Wynn!

111
00:12:30,104 --> 00:12:32,142
Priorities have changed, Al.

112
00:12:32,298 --> 00:12:34,629
There's a town less than
a mile away from here.

113
00:12:34,798 --> 00:12:37,303
If you release the virus,
they'll all die.

114
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:41,768
A town with approximately
8,000 experimental hosts.

115
00:12:41,908 --> 00:12:44,029
Are you out of your damn mind?

116
00:12:44,071 --> 00:12:45,865
I'm not gonna let you do this.

117
00:12:53,543 --> 00:12:55,541
Looks like I'm up for a promotion.

118
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:57,570
You wipe his ass, too?

119
00:13:01,957 --> 00:13:03,788
You son of a bitch.

120
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:06,200
You knew what was going on all along.

121
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,387
I do believe he's catching on.

122
00:13:12,902 --> 00:13:15,154
Enjoy your retirement, old friend.

123
00:13:15,196 --> 00:13:18,278
Oh, and by the way, don't
worry about Wanda.

124
00:13:19,349 --> 00:13:21,104
I'll take good care of her.

125
00:13:22,424 --> 00:13:25,344
You touch her, and you're a dead man.

126
00:13:26,784 --> 00:13:28,409
You're the dead man.

127
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:37,675
See you later, Al.

128
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:04,451
Wanda!

129
00:14:28,943 --> 00:14:32,308
Aw, look who was left
in the oven too long.

130
00:14:34,157 --> 00:14:36,159
I told him well-done, not burnt.

131
00:14:36,969 --> 00:14:38,828
Their gonna have fun with you.

132
00:14:41,289 --> 00:14:41,974
Boo!

133
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:10,878
Hey, mister, you don't look so good.

134
00:16:11,863 --> 00:16:13,459
Hey, mister, you thirsty?

135
00:16:14,877 --> 00:16:16,248
Hey, mister, you thirsty?

136
00:16:17,873 --> 00:16:18,830
Get the...

137
00:16:19,985 --> 00:16:21,488
Get lost, kid.

138
00:16:25,632 --> 00:16:27,687
What are you looking at, old man?

139
00:16:29,735 --> 00:16:31,040
You tell me.

140
00:16:33,736 --> 00:16:35,868
You've been gone a long time, friend.

141
00:16:36,237 --> 00:16:37,947
What are you talking about?

142
00:16:37,989 --> 00:16:39,365
Where am I?

143
00:16:39,407 --> 00:16:41,390
Rat city.
Part of the alley.

144
00:16:41,673 --> 00:16:42,903
I sleep over there.

145
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:47,624
This is a holy place.
All are welcome here.

146
00:16:47,665 --> 00:16:49,000
Here, Zack, here.

147
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:51,836
Yeah, right.

148
00:16:54,345 --> 00:16:58,458
I've seen worse faces, mister.
My dad used to work for a mortician.

149
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:03,979
Thanks, kid.
I feel much better now.

150
00:17:44,606 --> 00:17:46,691
Don't loiter!
Let's go! Let's go!

151
00:17:57,074 --> 00:18:01,093
You're welcome to join us...
if you choose.

152
00:18:06,134 --> 00:18:07,580
I got a home.

153
00:18:20,484 --> 00:18:23,407
A new spawn has emerged
from the darkness.

154
00:18:24,546 --> 00:18:26,226
Reborn on Earth...

155
00:18:27,058 --> 00:18:29,818
drawn to the alley by
an unknown force...

156
00:18:29,838 --> 00:18:32,681
his necroplasmic body
wracked by pain...

157
00:18:32,701 --> 00:18:34,611
his memories fragmented.

158
00:18:34,846 --> 00:18:37,766
To him, North Korea was moments ago.

159
00:18:37,926 --> 00:18:42,381
But Malebolgia kept him secluded
in darkness five long years...

160
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:45,755
while things on Earth
changed in ways...

161
00:18:45,775 --> 00:18:49,044
that will only feed his anger
and desire for revenge.

162
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,848
He sets out to reclaim his humanity.

163
00:18:54,693 --> 00:18:58,233
How much is left remains to be seen.

164
00:19:19,797 --> 00:19:21,252
One...

165
00:19:21,272 --> 00:19:22,745
two...

166
00:19:22,765 --> 00:19:24,896
three!

167
00:19:31,307 --> 00:19:32,724
Wanda!

168
00:19:36,399 --> 00:19:38,192
I don't have a choice.

169
00:19:38,234 --> 00:19:40,653
I'll always love you...

170
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,377
forever.

171
00:19:44,423 --> 00:19:45,982
- How's this doing?
- I don't know...

172
00:19:46,002 --> 00:19:48,297
I'm gonna get the troops
some more lemonade, OK?

173
00:19:52,855 --> 00:19:54,023
I'll take some.

174
00:20:09,903 --> 00:20:11,189
Spaz.

175
00:20:13,905 --> 00:20:15,961
They say it's a trick, but it's snot.

176
00:20:16,787 --> 00:20:18,825
Ah!
I'm amazing, aren't I?!

177
00:20:19,228 --> 00:20:21,097
Hey, little girl, where you going?

178
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,904
Want some candy?

179
00:20:30,615 --> 00:20:31,826
Cyan!

180
00:20:33,289 --> 00:20:36,684
You OK, baby? Huh, huh?
Terry! Terry!

181
00:20:36,704 --> 00:20:38,454
I like children... fried.

182
00:20:39,737 --> 00:20:40,528
Terry!

183
00:20:41,672 --> 00:20:42,855
Wanda...

184
00:20:44,113 --> 00:20:45,127
What's going on?

185
00:20:45,147 --> 00:20:47,219
I came out here and this man
was lying next to Cyan.

186
00:20:47,822 --> 00:20:49,327
- Are you OK, honey?
- Uh huh.

187
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:51,349
What are you doing back here, huh?

188
00:20:52,383 --> 00:20:53,409
What is it?

189
00:20:54,832 --> 00:20:57,245
Beat it, 'fore I call the cops, huh.
Come on, get outta here.

190
00:20:57,265 --> 00:21:00,255
Oh, there you are.
I've been looking everywhere for you.

191
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:03,945
Bad Crispy! Bad Crispy!

192
00:21:03,986 --> 00:21:05,637
Clown not like.

193
00:21:06,497 --> 00:21:08,149
Sorry for the turbulence, folks.

194
00:21:08,169 --> 00:21:09,833
He's harmless.
He's safe as milk.

195
00:21:09,853 --> 00:21:11,833
Just a freak accident
with some Jiffy Pop.

196
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:14,477
All right, that's it. Just get your stuff,
get out of here and take him with you.

197
00:21:14,497 --> 00:21:17,616
Oh, what an adorable little girl.

198
00:21:17,636 --> 00:21:19,543
Oh, look at her...
Can I keep her?

199
00:21:19,585 --> 00:21:20,444
Hey.

200
00:21:20,464 --> 00:21:23,124
Oh, of course not.
No pets allowed.

201
00:21:23,798 --> 00:21:26,401
A little something for lovely here?

202
00:21:26,608 --> 00:21:28,012
Baby exorcist.

203
00:21:29,138 --> 00:21:31,777
All right!
Come on, my barbecued friend.

204
00:21:32,925 --> 00:21:36,136
Don't want to keep that side order
of potato salad waiting, now do we?

205
00:21:40,418 --> 00:21:41,310
Terry...

206
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:44,764
- He knew my name.
- Are you sure?

207
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,740
Come on.
Let's get the kids inside.

208
00:21:56,372 --> 00:21:57,540
You can't get married.

209
00:21:57,582 --> 00:22:00,018
Wanda's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

210
00:22:00,038 --> 00:22:01,502
I'm there for you, buddy.

211
00:22:01,544 --> 00:22:03,421
This is my last mission.

212
00:22:03,462 --> 00:22:04,630
Wait for me.

213
00:22:04,672 --> 00:22:06,215
I just don't want to lose you, baby.

214
00:22:06,257 --> 00:22:09,462
You will never lose me.
I promise.

215
00:22:13,535 --> 00:22:16,539
Oh, yes we are...
Master and I are going to have words.

216
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:19,020
He knows I hate clowns.
God, I hate 'em.

217
00:22:19,061 --> 00:22:20,141
I hate 'em all.

218
00:22:20,161 --> 00:22:22,189
I hate Bozo, Ronald, Chuckles...

219
00:22:22,231 --> 00:22:26,360
with their freakin' dumb noses
and their lousy party hats!

220
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:31,449
I don't mind being
short, fat, and ugly,

221
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:32,869
but the pay sucks!

222
00:22:37,888 --> 00:22:39,312
What? Hey!

223
00:22:39,597 --> 00:22:41,128
Easy with that face.
I'm eating.

224
00:22:42,354 --> 00:22:44,412
Oops. A wet one.

225
00:22:44,825 --> 00:22:47,379
I hope I didn't stain my underwear.

226
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,654
Look at that.
Skid marks.

227
00:22:50,674 --> 00:22:52,807
Get away from me, you freak.

228
00:22:53,474 --> 00:22:56,868
Oh, coming from a monster,
that really hurts my feelings.

229
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:59,121
Hey, come back here, bacon face.

230
00:22:59,438 --> 00:23:01,091
I'm not done with you yet.

231
00:23:01,777 --> 00:23:04,556
Feels like my skin
is about to explode.

232
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:09,214
That's your viral necroplasm
going through its larval stage.

233
00:23:09,942 --> 00:23:10,966
Move over.

234
00:23:11,895 --> 00:23:13,969
Pretty soon you're gonna
get hair in funny places,

235
00:23:13,989 --> 00:23:15,887
and you're gonna start
thinking about girls.

236
00:23:17,305 --> 00:23:19,305
Tell me about it.
Talk to me.

237
00:23:20,348 --> 00:23:22,630
Just get me to a hospital.

238
00:23:22,733 --> 00:23:24,020
A hospital?

239
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:27,938
Have you looked in a mirror,
lately, burnt man walking?

240
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:32,033
Even the entire cast of "ER"
couldn't put you back together again.

241
00:23:32,293 --> 00:23:33,920
How do I put this to you?

242
00:23:34,016 --> 00:23:35,547
You're, ah, pushing up daisies.

243
00:23:35,567 --> 00:23:37,406
You're in permanent nap time.

244
00:23:37,566 --> 00:23:40,483
You're fertilizer.
Hey, is any of this sinking in?

245
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:41,713
You're dead.

246
00:23:41,733 --> 00:23:44,504
D-e-d. Dead.

247
00:23:45,492 --> 00:23:47,577
I guess five years
feeding earthworms...

248
00:23:47,597 --> 00:23:49,990
has eaten what little
brain there was in there.

249
00:23:52,771 --> 00:23:55,065
What are you?

250
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:00,255
Well, allow me to
kick-start your memory.

251
00:24:00,275 --> 00:24:03,198
Hang on.
These flashbacks can be killers.

252
00:24:04,092 --> 00:24:05,492
You're the dead man.

253
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:31,044
This is the bargain.

254
00:24:31,086 --> 00:24:36,299
If you lead my army, you
can see Wanda again.

255
00:24:39,578 --> 00:24:42,226
What is your answer?

256
00:24:42,502 --> 00:24:43,507
Yes!..

257
00:24:43,713 --> 00:24:46,248
Yes, I will lead your army!

258
00:24:46,268 --> 00:24:47,602
Anything for Wanda!

259
00:24:50,407 --> 00:24:55,110
If you fail me, you will die!

260
00:24:55,944 --> 00:25:01,283
Avenge your murder!
Kill Jason Wynn!

261
00:25:03,462 --> 00:25:06,570
Foul Malebolgia spent five
years preparing the Earth...

262
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:08,251
for your arrival, mister.

263
00:25:08,271 --> 00:25:10,429
A little death,
a little destruction...

264
00:25:10,449 --> 00:25:12,024
perfect marriage.

265
00:25:12,756 --> 00:25:14,324
Speaking of marriage...

266
00:25:14,344 --> 00:25:16,590
guess who's not your wifeola anymore?

267
00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:20,594
And the winners are: Wanda and Terry.

268
00:25:20,635 --> 00:25:22,776
Multiplying like rabbits.

269
00:25:22,907 --> 00:25:24,953
And jumpin' and pumpin'...

270
00:25:24,973 --> 00:25:26,646
and doin' it and...

271
00:25:26,666 --> 00:25:29,313
You stay away from her.

272
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:30,561
I don't want Wanda.

273
00:25:30,581 --> 00:25:32,643
I want you to take care of Wynn.

274
00:25:32,663 --> 00:25:35,986
And then you and the army can
kick some angelic buttocks.

275
00:25:36,891 --> 00:25:38,844
And in return for your services,

276
00:25:38,966 --> 00:25:40,478
we'll get Wanda back for you.

277
00:25:40,498 --> 00:25:42,544
Heck, you could have every
Wanda on the planet.

278
00:25:42,564 --> 00:25:44,580
Why settle for leftovers, huh?

279
00:25:46,203 --> 00:25:48,785
I like this guy.
Oh, you kill me!

280
00:25:48,805 --> 00:25:51,282
Go ahead, stud.

281
00:25:51,988 --> 00:25:54,659
This is all some
sadistic game of Wynn's.

282
00:25:55,462 --> 00:25:57,071
And when I catch him...

283
00:25:57,216 --> 00:25:59,628
he's gonna wish he had killed
me when he had the chance.

284
00:25:59,648 --> 00:26:01,766
That's it!
That's the spirit.

285
00:26:01,786 --> 00:26:04,175
Just think of me as
your guardian angel.

286
00:26:04,335 --> 00:26:05,997
The clown from Hell.

287
00:26:06,166 --> 00:26:08,455
You're Jimmy Stewart,
and I'm Clarence.

288
00:26:08,558 --> 00:26:11,694
"Uh, well, well, every
time somebody farts,

289
00:26:11,714 --> 00:26:13,854
"a demon gets his wings, ah..."

290
00:26:14,587 --> 00:26:15,919
Oops, twins.

291
00:26:16,531 --> 00:26:19,789
Get away from me, you
foul-smelling maggot!

292
00:26:19,809 --> 00:26:22,174
Well, you still don't get
it, do you, Amnesia Boy?

293
00:26:22,418 --> 00:26:24,449
We're gonna have to
dig a little deeper.

294
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:32,234
What is this?

295
00:26:32,735 --> 00:26:36,092
This is where old folks
go after Florida, son.

296
00:26:36,251 --> 00:26:37,829
What is that you say?

297
00:26:37,849 --> 00:26:39,908
Can I dig up my body now?

298
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:42,897
Why, certainly.
Of course you can.

299
00:26:42,917 --> 00:26:45,433
If you strike oil, half of it is mine.

300
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:49,000
Start digging.

301
00:26:49,282 --> 00:26:56,805
I command the forces of darkness
to bestow their powers unto me!

302
00:27:01,436 --> 00:27:03,820
Told you we needed to
watch the Exorcist.

303
00:27:04,112 --> 00:27:07,282
Hey, how 'bout we get back
to that sacri-fighting idea?

304
00:27:07,612 --> 00:27:09,038
You know what I need here, man?

305
00:27:09,058 --> 00:27:10,824
A fresh skull, man!

306
00:27:11,873 --> 00:27:13,160
Yeah, you.
A fresh skull...

307
00:27:13,201 --> 00:27:14,916
- Get away!
- A fresh skull!

308
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:57,537
A little bit more dead inside.

309
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:04,562
Noooooo!....

310
00:28:04,582 --> 00:28:06,932
Oh, come on.
You scream like a girl.

311
00:28:06,952 --> 00:28:08,246
Do it like this.

312
00:28:12,383 --> 00:28:15,108
Someone's a little angry 'cause
they died and went to...

313
00:28:15,149 --> 00:28:17,697
Hello, my mutant, hello, my carcass,

314
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,110
hello, my bug-infested corpse.

315
00:28:20,241 --> 00:28:22,457
Did, like, Satan send you guys?

316
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:25,707
How come God hogs up all
the good followers,

317
00:28:25,727 --> 00:28:26,911
and we get all the retards?

318
00:28:26,931 --> 00:28:28,602
Hey, what's up with that face?

319
00:28:28,622 --> 00:28:30,367
Get your hands off me!

320
00:28:42,292 --> 00:28:43,303
Help.

321
00:28:46,272 --> 00:28:47,437
What is that?

322
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:00,186
Look, it's so big.
That thing...

323
00:29:01,226 --> 00:29:04,507
Shocked and amazed at the
wonders of necroflesh?

324
00:29:05,695 --> 00:29:06,773
You're not alone.

325
00:29:06,815 --> 00:29:07,864
For a limited time only,

326
00:29:07,884 --> 00:29:10,427
you, too, can have this
handsome epidermis...

327
00:29:10,447 --> 00:29:14,490
for the eensy price of your
soul and a butt load of pain.

328
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:17,325
- Let's get out of here!
- Oh, my God!

329
00:29:17,813 --> 00:29:20,370
I hate weekend Satanists, don't you?

330
00:29:20,953 --> 00:29:23,592
Look at you.
Look at you...

331
00:29:23,901 --> 00:29:28,545
From spawn larva to full-fledged
Hellspawn in record time.

332
00:29:29,794 --> 00:29:32,301
What... is this?

333
00:29:32,321 --> 00:29:35,096
Oh, boy, you were tied to the tracks,

334
00:29:35,116 --> 00:29:38,776
and that stupid train just kept
running over you, now, didn't it?

335
00:29:38,796 --> 00:29:40,098
Running over you.

336
00:29:41,269 --> 00:29:44,151
Name of the people and things of Hell,

337
00:29:44,171 --> 00:29:45,588
I dub thee...

338
00:29:46,396 --> 00:29:49,803
Spawn!
General of Hell's armies!

339
00:29:49,823 --> 00:29:51,860
Arise, Your Crispness!

340
00:29:52,148 --> 00:29:54,796
Arise, Duke of Deep-Fried!

341
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:56,302
Sultan of Sizzling!

342
00:29:56,556 --> 00:29:58,838
Emir of Ooey-Gooey!

343
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:01,692
All right, so I suck as a clown.
Bite me.

344
00:30:01,899 --> 00:30:06,117
Now look, do your job, and I'll be
the first to kiss your black butt,

345
00:30:06,268 --> 00:30:07,901
but if you can't hack it,

346
00:30:08,293 --> 00:30:10,589
I'll gladly FedEx your
worthless carcass...

347
00:30:10,609 --> 00:30:11,745
back to the frying pan,

348
00:30:11,765 --> 00:30:14,214
where Malebolgia will be
waiting for both of us.

349
00:30:17,614 --> 00:30:19,659
You'll wake up the dead.
Ooh, that's you.

350
00:30:20,206 --> 00:30:22,610
You know, dead people
can still die, Shreky.

351
00:30:22,729 --> 00:30:24,767
All I got to do is cut off your head.

352
00:30:25,727 --> 00:30:27,011
Oh, God.

353
00:30:28,053 --> 00:30:31,119
Did you have to use the "G" word?
La, la, la, la, la, la, la...

354
00:30:31,232 --> 00:30:32,471
Wanda...

355
00:30:33,943 --> 00:30:35,564
What have I done?

356
00:30:42,516 --> 00:30:44,601
You done with this Hallmark moment?

357
00:30:44,704 --> 00:30:47,862
Cos I can't take any more of
this sentimental crap. Come on.

358
00:30:50,293 --> 00:30:52,504
I'll come back when
your armor hardens.

359
00:30:52,545 --> 00:30:54,798
Don't play with it.
You'll go blind.

360
00:30:55,548 --> 00:30:57,959
I have a few more
details to attend to,

361
00:30:57,979 --> 00:30:59,844
and then we can play.

362
00:31:05,563 --> 00:31:06,605
Yuck!

363
00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:08,446
I hate anchovies.

364
00:31:20,569 --> 00:31:23,865
Um, I tastes so good, I
could kick some puppies!

365
00:31:25,198 --> 00:31:25,949
Good!

366
00:31:40,197 --> 00:31:42,064
This freak stuff's
gonna come in handy...

367
00:31:42,084 --> 00:31:43,830
when I get my hands on Wynn.

368
00:31:44,478 --> 00:31:46,450
You're letting them get to you.

369
00:31:47,751 --> 00:31:48,924
Easy, friend.

370
00:31:49,093 --> 00:31:51,408
Every choice has its consequences.

371
00:31:53,116 --> 00:31:54,421
Who are you?

372
00:31:57,201 --> 00:31:59,764
An assassin... like you.

373
00:32:00,506 --> 00:32:03,742
Only, I killed for the Kingdom
of Saxony, 500 years ago.

374
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:06,099
I am Cogliostro.

375
00:32:06,537 --> 00:32:09,289
That's all you need to know...
for now.

376
00:32:09,738 --> 00:32:12,386
Are there any normal
people left on Earth?

377
00:32:12,987 --> 00:32:15,974
Or is everyone just back from Hell?

378
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,958
How do you address the
accusations from some...

379
00:32:55,978 --> 00:32:58,526
quarters that the CIA
only acts to protect...

380
00:32:58,546 --> 00:33:00,261
protect the government's
economic interests...

381
00:33:00,281 --> 00:33:01,488
in the regions of conflict?

382
00:33:01,831 --> 00:33:03,933
I think the government
has been as attentive...

383
00:33:03,953 --> 00:33:06,638
to the sensitivities of the
nations involved, as possible.

384
00:33:07,051 --> 00:33:10,289
Since the unfortunate incident
in Southeast Asia last week,

385
00:33:10,309 --> 00:33:12,933
Director Wynn has been meeting
with several world leaders...

386
00:33:13,064 --> 00:33:14,647
in an attempt to quell
the proliferation...

387
00:33:14,667 --> 00:33:15,795
of global conflicts.

388
00:33:15,815 --> 00:33:17,983
And has this produced
any positive results?

389
00:33:18,003 --> 00:33:21,289
I heard that last week's peace summit
between the Arabs and Israelis was...

390
00:33:22,155 --> 00:33:24,415
Fitzgerald may be a
spineless bureaucrat,

391
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:26,670
but he's doing a great P.R. job for me.

392
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:28,735
Whole world is going to
Hell in a hand basket.

393
00:33:28,755 --> 00:33:32,195
But, thanks to him, he's just
another story on the 5:00 news.

394
00:33:32,561 --> 00:33:34,543
Like lambs to the slaughter.

395
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,815
The best is yet to come.

396
00:33:42,334 --> 00:33:43,546
There it is, Jess.

397
00:33:44,212 --> 00:33:45,358
Finally ready.

398
00:33:45,808 --> 00:33:47,010
HEAT-16.

399
00:33:47,711 --> 00:33:50,350
Makes the Ebola virus
look like a skin rash.

400
00:33:51,467 --> 00:33:54,414
That North Korean biochemical
operation really paid off.

401
00:33:54,818 --> 00:33:58,275
We have harvested the ultimate
weapon from those diseased bodies,

402
00:33:58,527 --> 00:34:00,611
now we have the only vaccine.

403
00:34:02,794 --> 00:34:04,897
- Was there ever any doubt?
- Never.

404
00:34:05,156 --> 00:34:07,933
Now we have weapons in place
to disperse HEAT-16...

405
00:34:07,953 --> 00:34:10,684
over half of this godforsaken globe.

406
00:34:11,023 --> 00:34:13,520
Soon the whole world
will be at my command.

407
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:15,660
Anyone who refuses to
join my consorte...

408
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,333
he won't be around to argue.

409
00:34:53,256 --> 00:34:55,341
Time to get reacquainted, Jason.

410
00:34:56,342 --> 00:34:59,033
Director Wynn, Terry
Fitzgerald is here.

411
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,480
Send him in.

412
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:04,642
Speak of the devil. Come in, Terry.
Good to see you.

413
00:35:04,888 --> 00:35:06,699
- Director, the car is waiting downstairs.
- Good.

414
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:08,990
- You know Agent Priest.
- Yes.

415
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:11,065
Could I have a word with you...
alone?

416
00:35:11,107 --> 00:35:13,133
Of course.
Would you excuse us, my dear?

417
00:35:16,797 --> 00:35:18,281
Glad you dropped by, son.

418
00:35:18,323 --> 00:35:21,097
I been meaning to commend you on
the way you've handled the media.

419
00:35:21,117 --> 00:35:23,300
Those rumors about me were
becoming a real headache.

420
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,217
- Let's have a drink.
- Thank you.

421
00:35:26,758 --> 00:35:28,730
I know we've been
covering up problems...

422
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:30,645
with our missions overseas.

423
00:35:31,304 --> 00:35:33,505
I really can't keep
lying like this, sir.

424
00:35:33,629 --> 00:35:36,216
Lying? Really?

425
00:35:37,037 --> 00:35:38,551
I'd like to put a team together,

426
00:35:38,593 --> 00:35:41,509
analyze the field op data,
get to the bottom of it.

427
00:35:41,529 --> 00:35:43,834
But you're not an
analyst anymore, Terry.

428
00:35:43,854 --> 00:35:46,372
Well, there's no reason
not to take a look, sir.

429
00:35:46,392 --> 00:35:49,136
- On the contrary.
- Beg your pardon?

430
00:35:49,789 --> 00:35:54,400
Tell me...
how are Cyan and Wanda?

431
00:35:55,913 --> 00:35:58,238
Little girl just had a
birthday, didn't she?

432
00:35:58,776 --> 00:35:59,978
They're both fine.

433
00:35:59,998 --> 00:36:01,405
I'm glad to hear that.

434
00:36:01,699 --> 00:36:03,555
Now, let's get something straight.

435
00:36:04,147 --> 00:36:06,579
I run this organization
the way I see fit,

436
00:36:06,758 --> 00:36:10,100
and I will do whatever is
necessary to keep it that way.

437
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:13,586
Your job is to make damn sure
the public agrees with me.

438
00:36:13,628 --> 00:36:14,908
That clear enough?

439
00:36:15,334 --> 00:36:17,090
- Yes
- Good.

440
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:26,474
The car is waiting.

441
00:37:16,816 --> 00:37:18,651
Achmed and Abdullah.

442
00:37:18,693 --> 00:37:20,102
Achmed, my friend.

443
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,382
Abdullah, good to see you.

444
00:37:23,368 --> 00:37:24,199
Up.

445
00:37:28,803 --> 00:37:29,873
This one here.

446
00:37:30,155 --> 00:37:31,695
- Excuse us.
- No...but...

447
00:37:49,935 --> 00:37:51,976
Excuse me, sir.
Urgent call.

448
00:37:52,536 --> 00:37:53,503
Gentlemen...

449
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:55,522
Have you made a decision?

450
00:37:55,563 --> 00:37:57,807
Your HEAT-16 test was very impressive.

451
00:37:57,827 --> 00:38:00,735
Tell, me, how do you control
delivery of the weapon?

452
00:38:00,777 --> 00:38:02,987
The latest in nanotechnology.

453
00:38:03,029 --> 00:38:06,241
Let me assure you, gentlemen,
the weapon is problem-free.

454
00:38:06,261 --> 00:38:09,015
We've already placed orders
with several of our allies.

455
00:38:09,761 --> 00:38:12,872
You're becoming quite a
powerful man, Mr Wynn.

456
00:38:12,914 --> 00:38:15,790
Your consortium will soon
rival the United Nations.

457
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:16,793
Not at all, sir.

458
00:38:16,835 --> 00:38:19,045
I'm just a facilitator.
Thank you.

459
00:38:19,227 --> 00:38:21,302
My partners are the beneficiaries.

460
00:38:21,798 --> 00:38:23,508
To my partners, gentlemen.

461
00:38:26,307 --> 00:38:28,334
- Fitzgerald.
- Code red security breach, sir.

462
00:38:28,354 --> 00:38:29,536
- Where?
- At the armory.

463
00:38:29,556 --> 00:38:30,804
A detail's en-route.

464
00:38:30,824 --> 00:38:33,115
I'm on my way.
Damn it.

465
00:38:34,436 --> 00:38:36,072
Agent Priest has arrived.

466
00:38:47,349 --> 00:38:48,491
Wait here.

467
00:38:49,064 --> 00:38:51,391
There's been a break-in
at A-6, the armory.

468
00:38:51,683 --> 00:38:53,054
- Who?
- We don't know.

469
00:38:53,074 --> 00:38:55,039
There's a security detail
downstairs with Priest.

470
00:38:55,151 --> 00:38:56,587
Let's get out of here.

471
00:39:13,099 --> 00:39:14,720
You!

472
00:39:18,625 --> 00:39:19,780
Who are you?

473
00:39:21,149 --> 00:39:22,992
What's the matter, Jason?

474
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:25,585
You don't recognize
your own handiwork?

475
00:39:27,096 --> 00:39:30,880
You left me to die in that
bio-chem plant, remember?

476
00:39:31,566 --> 00:39:32,561
Simmons!

477
00:39:34,337 --> 00:39:36,247
You sent me to Hell, Jason!

478
00:39:36,712 --> 00:39:38,787
I'm here to return the favor!

479
00:39:45,122 --> 00:39:46,623
I trusted you.

480
00:39:47,074 --> 00:39:49,474
- Jesus.
- How could you marry Wanda?

481
00:39:49,656 --> 00:39:51,027
How could you?

482
00:39:51,469 --> 00:39:54,465
Al, when you died...

483
00:39:55,548 --> 00:39:57,384
Wanda was devastated.

484
00:39:59,071 --> 00:40:00,743
Do you know about Cyan?

485
00:40:05,453 --> 00:40:07,321
Time to die, Jason.

486
00:40:13,233 --> 00:40:15,454
Nice outfit, asshole.

487
00:40:31,632 --> 00:40:33,133
Damn.

488
00:40:35,552 --> 00:40:36,971
What the hell is that?

489
00:40:37,345 --> 00:40:38,697
It's Simmons!

490
00:40:38,895 --> 00:40:40,349
What are you talking about?

491
00:40:40,391 --> 00:40:42,014
That thing is Simmons!

492
00:40:42,034 --> 00:40:43,978
I want you to nail him, now!

493
00:41:25,193 --> 00:41:28,446
It's a little early for
Halloween, Simmons.

494
00:41:28,488 --> 00:41:31,903
Where you're going,
every day's Halloween.

495
00:41:35,754 --> 00:41:37,905
You don't have the guts.

496
00:41:44,833 --> 00:41:45,983
You're right.

497
00:41:46,184 --> 00:41:47,554
Coming, coming.

498
00:41:47,574 --> 00:41:50,222
Will that be the same or
separate checks, lady?

499
00:41:51,752 --> 00:41:54,493
Just when I was getting sick
of you whining about Wanda,

500
00:41:54,513 --> 00:41:56,025
you do us proud.

501
00:41:56,176 --> 00:41:58,348
So congrats on your first mission.

502
00:41:58,608 --> 00:41:59,926
Go ahead, inspect 'em.

503
00:42:35,414 --> 00:42:36,522
Hell yeah!

504
00:42:48,694 --> 00:42:50,567
Shoot on sight.

505
00:42:50,667 --> 00:42:53,006
I say again- shoot on sight.

506
00:42:53,047 --> 00:42:54,497
Get a light on him!

507
00:42:56,884 --> 00:42:57,844
There!

508
00:43:18,897 --> 00:43:20,632
- You see him?
- No, sir!

509
00:43:23,201 --> 00:43:24,852
Where the hell'd he go?

510
00:43:30,334 --> 00:43:31,658
Negative, sir!

511
00:43:42,055 --> 00:43:44,555
- There he is!
- All right! Take him!

512
00:44:29,811 --> 00:44:31,474
All right, what have
we got here, fellas?

513
00:44:31,494 --> 00:44:33,203
Gunshot wound to the head, Doc.

514
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:35,149
Ah, she's dead.

515
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:36,827
- Come on.
- All right.

516
00:44:36,977 --> 00:44:37,963
Let's go!

517
00:44:39,432 --> 00:44:40,447
Easy.

518
00:44:41,442 --> 00:44:42,493
Yup...there.

519
00:44:43,245 --> 00:44:44,297
That's it!

520
00:44:45,653 --> 00:44:47,663
Yeah, make some room here.
Make some room!

521
00:44:50,551 --> 00:44:52,955
- Put her around the back.
- Keep her on back.

522
00:45:00,135 --> 00:45:02,295
Why didn't you warn me about Simmons?

523
00:45:02,315 --> 00:45:04,608
Spawn was ready sooner
than I expected,

524
00:45:04,628 --> 00:45:06,821
so don't get your panties in a wad.

525
00:45:06,981 --> 00:45:08,417
Always bitching at me...

526
00:45:08,437 --> 00:45:09,976
"Why didn't you tell
me about Simmons?"

527
00:45:10,018 --> 00:45:11,603
"Why didn't you tell me
it was going to hurt?"

528
00:45:11,644 --> 00:45:12,943
"Am I going to go to Hell?"

529
00:45:13,056 --> 00:45:15,356
Oh, grow up, you sniveling ninny.

530
00:45:15,398 --> 00:45:17,317
At least you had fun compared to them.

531
00:45:17,496 --> 00:45:18,302
Fun?

532
00:45:18,322 --> 00:45:21,299
- Does this look like Playland to you?
- No.

533
00:45:21,319 --> 00:45:23,822
No, he killed Jessica!
He damn near killed me!

534
00:45:23,842 --> 00:45:25,993
You say that like it's a bad thing.

535
00:45:27,011 --> 00:45:30,663
No, Jerky.
Jerky, Spawn's a big idiot.

536
00:45:30,705 --> 00:45:32,498
Look, he's been through Hell.

537
00:45:34,872 --> 00:45:37,342
As soon as he finishes
one more little detail,

538
00:45:37,586 --> 00:45:39,267
he'll be ready to join us.

539
00:45:39,492 --> 00:45:41,128
Now, I've done my part.

540
00:45:41,362 --> 00:45:43,728
How about yours?
How we doing on your front?

541
00:45:45,937 --> 00:45:47,918
HEAT-16 is ready to go.

542
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:51,026
It better be, bozo.
It better be.

543
00:45:51,311 --> 00:45:52,635
The armies ready.

544
00:45:52,937 --> 00:45:54,525
The Spawn's ready.

545
00:45:54,567 --> 00:45:56,484
The HEAT-16 completes the picture.

546
00:45:56,504 --> 00:45:58,196
Congrat-a-freak-a-lations.

547
00:45:58,216 --> 00:46:00,213
What's Simmons got
to do with all this?

548
00:46:00,233 --> 00:46:03,798
Oh, he's just the highest-scoring
killer of all time, that's all.

549
00:46:03,818 --> 00:46:06,597
If we hadn't recruited him, the
other side would have, musclehead.

550
00:46:06,857 --> 00:46:09,567
Odjiguy, almost forgot again.

551
00:46:09,857 --> 00:46:12,017
Memo from Brimstone Breath...

552
00:46:12,505 --> 00:46:15,012
we're gonna rig a
fancy-schmancy device...

553
00:46:15,032 --> 00:46:17,802
that connects your heartbeat
to the HEAT-16 bomb,

554
00:46:17,822 --> 00:46:21,177
so if your heart stops
ticking, the bomb goes off.

555
00:46:21,290 --> 00:46:22,783
We don't want any
smart-ass fruitcake...

556
00:46:22,803 --> 00:46:24,530
taking you out ahead of schedule.

557
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:27,409
Sort of an insurance policy
from the good hands people.

558
00:46:27,429 --> 00:46:29,503
That's a good idea.
I like that.

559
00:46:29,523 --> 00:46:32,996
Now I want your special attention
dealing with Spawn, you hear me?

560
00:46:33,016 --> 00:46:35,012
- Gladly.
- Good.

561
00:46:35,181 --> 00:46:36,308
Now, stay sharp.

562
00:46:36,328 --> 00:46:37,604
The night is young.

563
00:46:37,782 --> 00:46:39,033
Ladies?

564
00:46:41,337 --> 00:46:42,557
Ooh, Clownie.

565
00:46:42,745 --> 00:46:43,871
Ah, yes.

566
00:46:43,913 --> 00:46:46,445
Have you ever been to a
clown's pink playpen?

567
00:46:46,583 --> 00:46:48,620
Well, I think it's about time.

568
00:46:50,061 --> 00:46:53,272
Oh, it's all good, baby.
It's all good, yeah.

569
00:46:53,292 --> 00:46:55,142
When all the world is mine,

570
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:59,429
I will personally fry your lard-ass.

571
00:47:02,098 --> 00:47:03,011
As you've seen,

572
00:47:03,031 --> 00:47:06,019
the terrible North Korean
biochemical disaster...

573
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:08,813
unleashed a whole
host of new diseases.

574
00:47:08,855 --> 00:47:10,898
Ten thousand people died
in the first month...

575
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:12,955
after the disaster five years ago.

576
00:47:12,975 --> 00:47:16,237
Since then, millions of people have
contracted these fatal diseases:

577
00:47:16,279 --> 00:47:18,901
Diphtheria, cholera, smallpox.

578
00:47:19,108 --> 00:47:21,034
Diseases that had been
virtually wiped out.

579
00:47:21,075 --> 00:47:23,756
Thought I was getting rid
of the world's vermin,

580
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:26,320
and I turn out to be one of them.

581
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:28,303
...death.
With outbreaks around the world...

582
00:47:28,583 --> 00:47:31,419
and the number of sick and dying
children continues to grow.

583
00:47:35,878 --> 00:47:37,216
It's up to us to put an end...

584
00:47:37,258 --> 00:47:39,927
to the suffering of these
innocent children.

585
00:47:39,969 --> 00:47:41,066
Spaz!

586
00:47:49,062 --> 00:47:50,480
What happened to you?

587
00:47:51,564 --> 00:47:54,734
I was playing with
Spaz, and I fell down.

588
00:47:54,776 --> 00:47:56,215
Are you all right?

589
00:47:56,235 --> 00:47:58,863
Yeah, I'm OK.

590
00:48:00,448 --> 00:48:03,951
Wow.
Your face is weird.

591
00:48:06,579 --> 00:48:08,289
Cool.

592
00:48:08,331 --> 00:48:09,791
What's your name?

593
00:48:11,959 --> 00:48:13,086
Spawn.

594
00:48:13,127 --> 00:48:14,921
I'm Cyan.

595
00:48:16,881 --> 00:48:18,738
You have your mother's eyes.

596
00:48:18,758 --> 00:48:22,512
I knew her a long time ago.

597
00:48:22,553 --> 00:48:25,056
Let's get you back to your mother.

598
00:48:25,098 --> 00:48:27,141
My, my, my.

599
00:48:27,183 --> 00:48:28,768
What a pretty little dress.

600
00:48:28,810 --> 00:48:32,438
I wonder if she's got it in my size?

601
00:48:33,523 --> 00:48:35,066
Spawnie, Spawnie, he's our man.

602
00:48:35,108 --> 00:48:37,090
If he can't kill'em, no one can.

603
00:48:37,110 --> 00:48:39,092
Yay, Spawnie!

604
00:48:39,112 --> 00:48:42,281
"S" to the "p" to the
"a" to the "awn. "

605
00:48:42,323 --> 00:48:43,866
Go, Spawnie, go, Spawnie!

606
00:48:46,869 --> 00:48:48,997
You fool!

607
00:48:49,038 --> 00:48:51,270
I put you on Earth...

608
00:48:51,290 --> 00:48:54,752
to make sure Spawn keeps
his end of the bargain.

609
00:48:54,794 --> 00:48:57,422
Why'd you pick him to
lead the army anyway?

610
00:48:57,463 --> 00:48:58,444
What are you thinking?

611
00:48:58,464 --> 00:49:00,258
It should be me.

612
00:49:00,299 --> 00:49:02,093
I had the tenure.

613
00:49:02,135 --> 00:49:05,513
It's not fair!
It's not fair!

614
00:49:05,555 --> 00:49:07,787
And that's exactly the kind of talk...

615
00:49:07,807 --> 00:49:10,435
we don't tolerate around
here, right, boss?

616
00:49:10,476 --> 00:49:11,978
Enough!

617
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:13,771
Spawn must choose...

618
00:49:13,813 --> 00:49:17,275
to murder Wynn and release the virus.

619
00:49:17,316 --> 00:49:21,529
Then my army will be complete.

620
00:49:21,571 --> 00:49:22,905
Now, now, boss...

621
00:49:22,947 --> 00:49:25,616
This is your last chance.

622
00:49:26,826 --> 00:49:28,036
Thank you.

623
00:49:31,247 --> 00:49:34,125
Excuse me.
Cyan!

624
00:49:35,585 --> 00:49:38,963
Honey, didn't I tell you
not to leave my sight?

625
00:49:39,005 --> 00:49:42,759
I was playing with
Spaz, and I fell down,

626
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:45,303
and Spawn came and helped me.

627
00:49:45,345 --> 00:49:47,597
You're not supposed to
talk to strangers, either.

628
00:49:47,638 --> 00:49:49,599
Spawn's not a stranger, Mommy.

629
00:49:51,516 --> 00:49:52,540
Wanda!

630
00:49:53,269 --> 00:49:55,980
- We're going home, right now.
- What's going on, Terry?

631
00:49:57,075 --> 00:49:58,383
Terry, what is going on?

632
00:49:58,403 --> 00:49:59,998
- Explain later.
- No, explain now!

633
00:50:00,018 --> 00:50:02,664
I'm not going through this again...
No secrets!

634
00:50:03,096 --> 00:50:05,528
There was trouble at the reception.
Wynn was attacked.

635
00:50:05,932 --> 00:50:07,450
I don't wanna take any chances.

636
00:50:09,632 --> 00:50:10,620
Trust me.

637
00:50:14,036 --> 00:50:14,919
OK.

638
00:50:26,132 --> 00:50:27,470
Go home.

639
00:50:31,184 --> 00:50:32,799
Fix your seat belt, honey.

640
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:35,905
What the hell is going on?

641
00:50:35,925 --> 00:50:38,310
Daddy, what about Spaz?

642
00:50:40,971 --> 00:50:42,041
Spaz?

643
00:50:44,332 --> 00:50:45,134
Spaz!

644
00:50:45,154 --> 00:50:46,627
Go home, Spaz.

645
00:50:47,896 --> 00:50:48,516
Spazy!

646
00:50:49,314 --> 00:50:50,064
Spaz!

647
00:50:51,239 --> 00:50:53,689
Honey, he knows the way back
home better than we do.

648
00:50:54,656 --> 00:50:56,887
- OK?
- OK.

649
00:50:58,459 --> 00:50:59,669
Let's go, Terry.

650
00:51:10,596 --> 00:51:13,016
You don't want to be where I'm going.

651
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:19,767
OK, but it's your funeral.

652
00:51:39,792 --> 00:51:41,586
What the hell are you doing, boy?

653
00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:43,713
You puking up decent food?

654
00:51:43,755 --> 00:51:44,922
It's rotten.

655
00:51:46,984 --> 00:51:47,980
Tastes fine to me.

656
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,012
You think we eat so good you can
just spit up what you like, huh?

657
00:51:51,032 --> 00:51:53,639
- No.
- Now, don't talk back to me.

658
00:51:59,576 --> 00:52:01,313
Eat this!

659
00:52:09,899 --> 00:52:12,433
No, don't!
He's my dad.

660
00:52:25,081 --> 00:52:26,624
Keep away from him.

661
00:52:30,383 --> 00:52:31,510
B.P. and heart rate?

662
00:52:31,530 --> 00:52:34,242
One-thirty-four over
77, heart rate, 60.

663
00:52:34,571 --> 00:52:36,862
Let's increase
the flow to 3.5.

664
00:52:40,221 --> 00:52:41,871
We're ready for the monitor.

665
00:52:45,005 --> 00:52:46,782
I'm gonna make a small incision...

666
00:52:46,802 --> 00:52:49,402
so that we can insert
this heart monitor.

667
00:52:49,422 --> 00:52:51,972
You're going to feel a slight pinch.

668
00:53:21,867 --> 00:53:26,158
Whoa, awesome hardware.
What are you gonna do with it?

669
00:53:26,178 --> 00:53:28,331
Throw someone a going-away party.

670
00:53:30,230 --> 00:53:31,417
Need any help?

671
00:53:32,607 --> 00:53:33,902
Listen, kid...

672
00:53:34,466 --> 00:53:36,409
I'm not looking to make friends.

673
00:53:42,379 --> 00:53:43,121
Hey!

674
00:53:45,870 --> 00:53:47,892
- What's your name?
- Zack.

675
00:53:49,224 --> 00:53:50,567
I'm Al.

676
00:53:51,525 --> 00:53:52,710
That's Spaz.

677
00:53:53,523 --> 00:53:54,612
Hi, Spaz!

678
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:55,656
Hey...

679
00:53:57,027 --> 00:53:57,853
Yeah!

680
00:54:01,787 --> 00:54:03,458
Breathe normally, Director.

681
00:54:07,474 --> 00:54:10,145
The system is now operational.

682
00:54:10,648 --> 00:54:12,517
As per your orders, Director Wynn,

683
00:54:12,667 --> 00:54:15,249
if your vital signs
flat-line for any reason,

684
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:18,892
the device will up-link and
detonate the HEAT-16 bombs.

685
00:54:19,487 --> 00:54:21,467
No one would dare kill you.

686
00:54:21,906 --> 00:54:24,040
Good work, Doc.

687
00:54:26,257 --> 00:54:28,210
What a double cross.

688
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:32,182
First I got Wynn to kill Spawn
and create the HEAT-16 bomb.

689
00:54:32,202 --> 00:54:35,562
Now I get Spawn to murder
Wynn and release the virus.

690
00:54:36,713 --> 00:54:39,174
If all goes well, this
should hurt like hell.

691
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:44,515
I can't believe I actually
got Wynn to get operated.

692
00:54:44,535 --> 00:54:46,021
What a maroon.

693
00:54:46,149 --> 00:54:48,757
It's going to send the
Earth into a tailspin...

694
00:54:48,777 --> 00:54:51,048
of death and destruction.

695
00:55:01,893 --> 00:55:03,152
It's time.

696
00:55:07,184 --> 00:55:12,082
You know, sometimes I wake up at night,
down in the alley, and wonder...

697
00:55:13,166 --> 00:55:14,584
Is this Hell?

698
00:55:14,983 --> 00:55:16,399
Not yet...

699
00:55:16,945 --> 00:55:18,354
but soon.

700
00:55:19,227 --> 00:55:20,354
Heads up.

701
00:55:22,008 --> 00:55:23,218
Hah, got one.

702
00:55:24,476 --> 00:55:26,608
So who's your new friend, Spawn?

703
00:55:26,748 --> 00:55:28,598
- Get out of here, Zack.
- But...

704
00:55:28,618 --> 00:55:29,725
Go!

705
00:55:37,649 --> 00:55:38,751
Miss me?

706
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:41,737
Here's Clownie!

707
00:55:43,641 --> 00:55:47,534
So...It was you who
told Wynn to kill me.

708
00:55:47,575 --> 00:55:49,557
Guilty as charged.

709
00:55:50,364 --> 00:55:52,831
Before I blow your
fat circus ass away,

710
00:55:52,872 --> 00:55:55,417
I wanna know why you picked
me to lead your war.

711
00:55:55,458 --> 00:55:59,111
Well, well, if it isn't Curious Crispy.

712
00:55:59,928 --> 00:56:03,532
Your DNA spelled DOA.
We just nursed it along.

713
00:56:03,552 --> 00:56:07,365
All those assassin missions were
just training for what's coming.

714
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:10,484
Let's get down to business.

715
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:14,009
Wynn's finally got that
HEAT-16 virus bomb working.

716
00:56:14,029 --> 00:56:15,249
Made especially for you.

717
00:56:15,269 --> 00:56:17,952
Get things started with a
big, wet, infectious...

718
00:56:17,972 --> 00:56:19,399
Kabomb!

719
00:56:19,643 --> 00:56:24,228
And all you have to do is just
lead us to the holy land,

720
00:56:24,508 --> 00:56:26,499
so we can burn it down!

721
00:56:29,163 --> 00:56:31,755
You filthy
little piece of vermin.

722
00:56:31,877 --> 00:56:34,938
What makes you think I
would join your army?

723
00:56:34,958 --> 00:56:37,608
You can take your army and shove it.

724
00:56:37,628 --> 00:56:39,091
Sounds like a country song...

725
00:56:39,111 --> 00:56:41,890
"You take the army of yours and shove it."
You take that.

726
00:56:42,153 --> 00:56:44,598
Oh, oh, you got that, "I want
to beat the fat little man"...

727
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,099
Look in your eye.

728
00:56:50,029 --> 00:56:52,479
I'm going to cut you into 50 pieces...

729
00:56:52,499 --> 00:56:54,545
and mail you to every state.

730
00:56:55,024 --> 00:56:57,611
I'm gonna take your intestines and...

731
00:57:00,107 --> 00:57:02,802
I don't know how you put
up with all this crap.

732
00:57:04,274 --> 00:57:05,850
You're a bigger fool than I thought...

733
00:57:05,870 --> 00:57:08,377
if you think you're going
to wreck my plans.

734
00:57:08,397 --> 00:57:10,874
You're gonna do just what you promised.

735
00:57:10,916 --> 00:57:12,535
Put down my dog.

736
00:57:13,014 --> 00:57:14,638
Nice doggie.

737
00:57:14,658 --> 00:57:16,516
Heel, fetch...

738
00:57:16,925 --> 00:57:18,465
No, I got it.

739
00:57:20,174 --> 00:57:21,582
Play dead!

740
00:57:29,684 --> 00:57:31,686
You want to do it the hard way?

741
00:57:32,255 --> 00:57:33,644
I warned you.

742
00:57:33,664 --> 00:57:36,746
I'm just gonna have to
teach you a lesson.

743
00:57:37,108 --> 00:57:39,485
No more clowning around.

744
00:57:39,505 --> 00:57:41,400
I'm not the vindicator...

745
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:43,344
or the victimizer...

746
00:57:43,364 --> 00:57:46,380
or the vaporizer, or the vibrator!

747
00:57:47,285 --> 00:57:48,506
I'm...

748
00:57:49,226 --> 00:57:51,714
the violator!

749
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:51,477
Oh, good Lord!

750
00:58:52,078 --> 00:58:53,224
Mom!

751
00:58:57,101 --> 00:58:58,942
Ain't staying around for this!

752
00:59:55,113 --> 00:59:57,170
- It ain't safe here!
- What?

753
01:00:07,631 --> 01:00:09,106
We're going.

754
01:01:21,423 --> 01:01:24,652
Violator, one, Spawnie-boy, zero.

755
01:01:30,769 --> 01:01:34,227
You've been violated, girlie-man, huh?

756
01:01:34,553 --> 01:01:36,585
I could have killed you like that.

757
01:01:37,323 --> 01:01:40,420
Twinkle, twinkle, little Spawn.

758
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:41,908
Gosh, you look like crap.

759
01:01:41,928 --> 01:01:44,716
Go fertilize my lawn.

760
01:01:44,913 --> 01:01:47,354
What, you're not excited yet?

761
01:01:47,374 --> 01:01:50,318
Helter-skelter's coming
down with or without you.

762
01:01:50,496 --> 01:01:54,462
Either you lead the army, or Wynn
plays hockey with Wanda's head.

763
01:01:55,069 --> 01:01:58,271
"Hey, Wanda, come on, how about giving
me some of that sweet stuff, baby. "

764
01:01:58,291 --> 01:02:02,716
"Oh, no.
Oh, please, Wynn, don't, please."

765
01:02:02,736 --> 01:02:04,939
"Somebody help me, now. "

766
01:02:04,959 --> 01:02:08,164
You...
Stay away from her.

767
01:02:08,859 --> 01:02:09,938
Your choice.

768
01:02:10,127 --> 01:02:11,852
See you at Wanda's.

769
01:02:11,872 --> 01:02:13,393
Don't be late.

770
01:02:15,658 --> 01:02:18,402
Wynn and Wanda sitting in a tree,

771
01:02:18,422 --> 01:02:22,098
L-i-c-k-i-n-g.

772
01:02:25,305 --> 01:02:27,904
It seems he truth has
taken its toll on you.

773
01:02:29,225 --> 01:02:31,125
I'm gonna nail that asshole.

774
01:02:31,145 --> 01:02:33,273
You still haven't learned.

775
01:02:57,017 --> 01:02:58,668
Clearance granted.

776
01:03:07,833 --> 01:03:10,444
Downloading secure files.

777
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:12,566
Yes!

778
01:03:19,289 --> 01:03:20,660
Gotcha, Jason.

779
01:03:24,122 --> 01:03:26,053
I can't afford to be wrong.

780
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:37,110
Still with us, I see.

781
01:03:46,266 --> 01:03:48,766
Don't worry, Dad, the
ambulance is here.

782
01:03:52,061 --> 01:03:53,563
Your vengeance...

783
01:03:53,979 --> 01:03:55,159
their pain.

784
01:03:55,439 --> 01:03:58,233
Wynn, Wanda...
None of this is worth the cost.

785
01:03:59,952 --> 01:04:02,637
Those are the only things
that matter to me now.

786
01:04:03,864 --> 01:04:05,314
Al Simmons is dead.

787
01:04:05,741 --> 01:04:06,975
Let him go.

788
01:04:07,660 --> 01:04:09,806
I am Simmons, old man!

789
01:04:15,181 --> 01:04:16,664
You're Spawn now,

790
01:04:17,246 --> 01:04:20,044
but that doesn't mean you
have to be what they want.

791
01:04:29,876 --> 01:04:32,167
You're still letting them get to you.

792
01:04:32,187 --> 01:04:33,360
Your anger's your weakness.

793
01:04:33,380 --> 01:04:37,079
And they'll use it to rob you
of any humanity you have left.

794
01:04:37,239 --> 01:04:39,030
Al Simmons knew that violence...

795
01:04:39,050 --> 01:04:42,466
only makes for more pain and suffering,
no matter which side gives the orders.

796
01:04:42,486 --> 01:04:44,363
He tried to leave off killing,

797
01:04:44,405 --> 01:04:46,349
give himself a second chance.

798
01:04:47,147 --> 01:04:48,620
Your old life is gone.

799
01:04:49,063 --> 01:04:50,138
Accept that.

800
01:04:52,612 --> 01:04:54,343
I still love Wanda.

801
01:04:54,567 --> 01:04:56,125
Put her in the past.

802
01:04:56,567 --> 01:04:58,529
It's the only way you can be free.

803
01:04:58,717 --> 01:05:00,970
She's the only reason I'm here.

804
01:05:05,392 --> 01:05:07,214
The war between Heaven and Hell...

805
01:05:07,505 --> 01:05:09,590
depends on the choices we make,

806
01:05:09,918 --> 01:05:12,472
and those choices require sacrifice.

807
01:05:13,365 --> 01:05:14,665
That's the test.

808
01:05:15,087 --> 01:05:15,810
Hey!

809
01:05:22,468 --> 01:05:24,693
I didn't know this
was going to happen.

810
01:05:26,693 --> 01:05:29,033
I'm gonna nail that dirtbag!

811
01:05:46,412 --> 01:05:48,018
Kiss it good-bye, Clown.

812
01:05:48,038 --> 01:05:51,513
This is just what they want.
You're playing their game.

813
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:54,508
Then I'll play dirty.

814
01:05:54,528 --> 01:05:57,811
- Guns are useless.
- You got a better idea?

815
01:06:13,035 --> 01:06:14,216
I might.

816
01:06:19,157 --> 01:06:22,565
You see, you've been using
your armor only by reflex.

817
01:06:22,753 --> 01:06:24,800
You must learn to control it.

818
01:06:24,820 --> 01:06:27,383
It has trillions of neuroconnections.

819
01:06:27,424 --> 01:06:30,307
They're a living extension
of your own instincts,

820
01:06:30,327 --> 01:06:33,302
instantly translating your thought...

821
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:35,471
into physical reality,

822
01:06:35,491 --> 01:06:38,866
so long as you stay clear and focused.

823
01:06:40,829 --> 01:06:44,200
- So... that's how it works.
- Yes.

824
01:06:52,740 --> 01:06:54,796
- Cool!
- Now try your chains.

825
01:07:01,693 --> 01:07:03,947
You must visualize your objective.

826
01:07:03,967 --> 01:07:05,177
The armor does the rest.

827
01:07:05,197 --> 01:07:07,534
All right, Yoda.
Just wait a second.

828
01:07:09,591 --> 01:07:10,755
You ready?

829
01:07:12,962 --> 01:07:14,135
All right, go!

830
01:07:21,614 --> 01:07:22,797
Not bad.

831
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:26,036
Don't get cocky.

832
01:07:26,141 --> 01:07:27,962
You've a lot more to learn.

833
01:07:28,569 --> 01:07:30,752
Your cape has its own powers.

834
01:07:30,911 --> 01:07:32,990
I have to get to Wanda's, old man.

835
01:07:37,362 --> 01:07:38,648
Take care of your powers.

836
01:07:38,668 --> 01:07:41,709
When you drain them, you die.

837
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:44,123
No guts, no glory.

838
01:07:47,714 --> 01:07:49,103
You're catching on.

839
01:07:50,793 --> 01:07:52,531
Won't be needing this.

840
01:07:58,585 --> 01:08:00,867
I want you to return Spaz to me.

841
01:08:01,308 --> 01:08:03,853
No matter how you find him.
Understand?

842
01:08:08,373 --> 01:08:12,589
Hey! Hey, come back!
Get back here!

843
01:08:12,609 --> 01:08:13,744
Now...

844
01:08:14,438 --> 01:08:16,363
the final test.

845
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:30,000
Get out of my way!

846
01:08:32,995 --> 01:08:34,924
I'm gonna get Spawn so worked up,

847
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:37,159
he'll kill Wynn without blinking.

848
01:08:40,628 --> 01:08:41,568
When I'm done with you,

849
01:08:41,588 --> 01:08:44,144
they're gonna change
your name to "Stite. "

850
01:08:54,914 --> 01:08:56,557
Look, Ma, no hands!

851
01:09:15,872 --> 01:09:17,045
I love the smell...

852
01:09:17,065 --> 01:09:19,336
of burning asphalt in the morning!

853
01:09:27,084 --> 01:09:30,149
Send a boy to do a
clown's job, will they?

854
01:09:32,578 --> 01:09:36,118
It's an honor to be a
Hellspawn, you hear me?

855
01:09:46,377 --> 01:09:48,167
Hey, that's not fair!

856
01:09:51,157 --> 01:09:53,654
Time for some necro-goo!

857
01:09:55,799 --> 01:09:59,553
Open wide and say "Aaagh!"

858
01:10:41,931 --> 01:10:43,743
See you at Wanda's!

859
01:11:16,515 --> 01:11:18,712
Reading secure files.

860
01:11:24,346 --> 01:11:25,742
Christ.

861
01:11:26,473 --> 01:11:28,689
Wynn is out of his mind.

862
01:11:49,217 --> 01:11:50,598
Wanda.

863
01:11:53,208 --> 01:11:55,044
I'm thirsty.

864
01:11:57,319 --> 01:11:59,000
OK, baby.

865
01:11:59,902 --> 01:12:01,620
You want some water?

866
01:12:03,488 --> 01:12:05,432
Establishing connection.

867
01:12:07,269 --> 01:12:08,433
What have you got?

868
01:12:08,453 --> 01:12:11,541
Black bag ops, assassination
lists, everything.

869
01:12:11,926 --> 01:12:14,563
Wynn's been using A-6 to
run a criminal consortium.

870
01:12:14,605 --> 01:12:17,655
He's got some biological weapon.
Calls it HEAT-16.

871
01:12:17,999 --> 01:12:19,210
and it's all there?

872
01:12:19,230 --> 01:12:20,966
Cos I want to get it
on tonight's news.

873
01:12:20,986 --> 01:12:22,838
I'm e-mailing you a copy.

874
01:12:22,969 --> 01:12:25,683
It should be enough to bury Wynn.
Let me know if it gets through.

875
01:12:25,786 --> 01:12:26,528
Great.

876
01:12:30,826 --> 01:12:31,690
Daddy?

877
01:12:32,610 --> 01:12:34,000
Hey, sweetheart.

878
01:12:39,496 --> 01:12:40,951
What are you doing here?

879
01:12:43,524 --> 01:12:45,468
Some unfinished business.

880
01:12:48,656 --> 01:12:51,323
Ah, you disappoint me, Terry.

881
01:12:56,098 --> 01:12:57,877
You can't release the virus.

882
01:12:57,919 --> 01:12:59,629
Millions of people will die.

883
01:12:59,671 --> 01:13:01,704
Only those who refuse to join me.

884
01:13:01,744 --> 01:13:05,789
Whatever it is you want,
just take it and go.

885
01:13:06,169 --> 01:13:07,583
I intend to.

886
01:13:12,357 --> 01:13:13,408
Let's go.

887
01:13:17,828 --> 01:13:19,002
On the floor.

888
01:13:20,025 --> 01:13:23,452
The kid stays with me.
Answer the door.

889
01:13:25,350 --> 01:13:26,307
Go on.

890
01:13:28,356 --> 01:13:30,027
It's all right, sweetheart.

891
01:13:35,662 --> 01:13:37,029
Peek-a-boo.

892
01:13:37,071 --> 01:13:39,277
I see you.

893
01:13:41,254 --> 01:13:43,911
You know how hard this place
is to find in the dark?

894
01:13:43,952 --> 01:13:46,952
It's times like these I
appreciate being a midget.

895
01:13:48,457 --> 01:13:51,865
Ohh...
Hello, Cyan. Remember me?

896
01:13:55,506 --> 01:13:58,020
You were at my birthday party.

897
01:13:58,292 --> 01:14:00,273
No duh.

898
01:14:00,686 --> 01:14:02,179
What are you, a regular Einstein?

899
01:14:02,221 --> 01:14:03,659
You sure know how to raise them...

900
01:14:03,679 --> 01:14:05,617
- ...Don't you?
- Don't you touch her.

901
01:14:06,490 --> 01:14:07,893
Back off, hero.

902
01:14:09,061 --> 01:14:11,146
I'm back by popular demand.

903
01:14:11,268 --> 01:14:13,775
Big as life and twice as rotten.

904
01:14:23,578 --> 01:14:25,587
Does wonders for my asthma.

905
01:14:26,893 --> 01:14:28,372
Where's Spawn?

906
01:14:28,564 --> 01:14:30,082
Let's cut the crap.

907
01:14:30,397 --> 01:14:33,168
Spawn's on his way.
You ready to play?

908
01:14:33,561 --> 01:14:34,920
Of course I am.

909
01:14:34,962 --> 01:14:37,008
Wynn, you better be.

910
01:14:41,969 --> 01:14:44,805
You don't know how much
your heart means to me.

911
01:14:46,415 --> 01:14:47,410
Boo!

912
01:14:49,866 --> 01:14:51,125
Bring 'em, Jerky.

913
01:14:51,612 --> 01:14:52,479
Come on.

914
01:15:22,359 --> 01:15:24,556
-Wanda!
- Help me, please.

915
01:15:25,974 --> 01:15:27,306
Careful.

916
01:15:27,347 --> 01:15:30,476
Don't make me nervous.
I might nick something vital.

917
01:15:30,576 --> 01:15:33,046
You touch her, and you die slow.

918
01:15:33,066 --> 01:15:34,088
All right, Spawn.

919
01:15:34,313 --> 01:15:36,190
No more fun and games.

920
01:15:36,210 --> 01:15:39,459
Either you join Hell's
army, or she dies...

921
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:42,331
I will rip your heart out!
Let her go!

922
01:15:42,782 --> 01:15:44,294
So what's it gonna be?

923
01:15:45,543 --> 01:15:47,138
Time's running out.

924
01:15:51,628 --> 01:15:53,929
- Too late.
- No!

925
01:15:58,942 --> 01:15:59,929
Wanda.

926
01:16:15,158 --> 01:16:16,999
No!

927
01:16:17,761 --> 01:16:19,387
It's all your fault, Spawn.

928
01:16:19,985 --> 01:16:22,349
She was doing fine till you showed up.

929
01:16:22,545 --> 01:16:25,143
Now you've got nothing left to lose.

930
01:16:25,419 --> 01:16:27,757
For a soulless corpse!

931
01:16:28,188 --> 01:16:29,297
Nothing!

932
01:16:31,258 --> 01:16:32,692
You're wrong.

933
01:16:36,648 --> 01:16:38,406
I still got you.

934
01:16:48,088 --> 01:16:51,638
Cyan...
Don't be afraid.

935
01:16:55,944 --> 01:16:58,836
- You can't kill me.
- Is that right?

936
01:16:58,856 --> 01:17:01,484
If my heart stops, then
the virus is released,

937
01:17:01,504 --> 01:17:03,014
and everybody in the world dies.

938
01:17:03,034 --> 01:17:05,260
Like you said...

939
01:17:05,372 --> 01:17:07,710
I've got nothing else to lose.

940
01:17:15,977 --> 01:17:18,154
That's right.
Feel the burn.

941
01:17:18,174 --> 01:17:20,530
Get used to it, cos it's payback time.

942
01:17:20,690 --> 01:17:22,586
See you in Hell, Jason.

943
01:17:29,949 --> 01:17:32,425
If you kill me, you kill her!

944
01:18:06,323 --> 01:18:08,755
I'm through doing Hell's dirty work.

945
01:18:21,576 --> 01:18:24,686
You worthless bag of...

946
01:18:25,933 --> 01:18:27,980
How could you let him kill me?

947
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:32,333
Me, the most important thing in
your entire freakin' universe!

948
01:18:32,438 --> 01:18:35,338
You pansy bacon-crisp!

949
01:18:40,194 --> 01:18:42,166
You should have killed him!

950
01:18:42,186 --> 01:18:45,706
Popped his head like a zit.

951
01:18:46,673 --> 01:18:49,227
It feels... so good.

952
01:18:49,588 --> 01:18:53,090
And feel that butt.
It feels so... hairy.

953
01:18:54,583 --> 01:18:55,457
Oops!

954
01:18:56,614 --> 01:18:58,570
OK, joke's over.

955
01:18:58,910 --> 01:19:01,609
You shoulda killed Jason
when you had the chance.

956
01:19:01,629 --> 01:19:02,680
Never.

957
01:19:02,700 --> 01:19:03,395
Never?

958
01:19:03,415 --> 01:19:05,971
What do you mean never?
Never?

959
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:09,575
Do you know how hard I've
been working on this?

960
01:19:09,595 --> 01:19:12,994
You set me up, you malignant sow!

961
01:19:14,018 --> 01:19:16,976
What do you think you got the
pacemaker for, turkey, huh?

962
01:19:16,996 --> 01:19:18,310
Your perfect attendance record,

963
01:19:18,330 --> 01:19:20,638
you spoon-sucking dipstick!

964
01:19:20,768 --> 01:19:22,566
I was counting on Spawn killing you.

965
01:19:22,586 --> 01:19:23,665
Then you would get his soul...

966
01:19:23,685 --> 01:19:26,088
and kick-start the apocalypse now.

967
01:19:26,395 --> 01:19:27,660
Can't trust anybody.

968
01:19:28,076 --> 01:19:31,005
I say destroy the cosmos,
ask questions later.

969
01:19:31,897 --> 01:19:33,018
But first...

970
01:19:33,794 --> 01:19:37,879
first, I wanna slaughter
each and every one of you.

971
01:19:39,341 --> 01:19:43,416
And then I wanna have a
little crème de Wanda.

972
01:19:46,808 --> 01:19:49,343
I'm gonna let you watch, too.

973
01:19:51,508 --> 01:19:52,883
Yummy yum.

974
01:19:59,485 --> 01:20:01,738
Umm, tastes like chicken.

975
01:20:05,146 --> 01:20:06,831
Mind if I cut in?

976
01:20:06,851 --> 01:20:08,690
Cogliostro!

977
01:20:09,366 --> 01:20:11,309
Come and get me!

978
01:20:11,569 --> 01:20:13,238
Suckers!

979
01:20:23,289 --> 01:20:24,790
He'll be back.

980
01:20:26,208 --> 01:20:28,002
Concentrate on healing.

981
01:20:28,438 --> 01:20:29,518
Come on!

982
01:20:34,203 --> 01:20:37,856
I may not be able to
hold him off alone.

983
01:20:39,848 --> 01:20:42,379
Come on down to my world!

984
01:21:08,115 --> 01:21:10,763
All right, you overgrown gecko...

985
01:21:11,364 --> 01:21:13,551
Come and get your throat cut.

986
01:23:05,331 --> 01:23:08,853
If you won't lead my army,

987
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:12,158
then you must die.

988
01:23:15,070 --> 01:23:16,187
Never!

989
01:23:16,207 --> 01:23:19,268
Bring me Spawn's head.

990
01:23:53,912 --> 01:23:56,719
You will never escape me.

991
01:24:20,431 --> 01:24:22,037
It's all right now, baby.

992
01:24:28,367 --> 01:24:29,452
Come on.

993
01:24:38,188 --> 01:24:39,071
You all right?

994
01:24:39,336 --> 01:24:41,204
They belong together.

995
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,258
There's no place for me here.

996
01:24:47,177 --> 01:24:49,017
Maybe you're the one after all.

997
01:24:50,698 --> 01:24:53,590
You were checking me out
from the start, weren't you?

998
01:24:54,635 --> 01:24:56,228
I'm too old for this.

999
01:24:56,523 --> 01:24:58,194
Not as quick as I used to be.

1000
01:24:59,020 --> 01:25:00,858
I've fought this war long enough.

1001
01:25:00,878 --> 01:25:02,818
It's time for someone to take over.

1002
01:25:03,308 --> 01:25:05,289
What if I sided with Clown?

1003
01:25:06,739 --> 01:25:07,985
I'd have killed you.

1004
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:12,023
Right.

1005
01:25:13,266 --> 01:25:14,346
Spaz!

1006
01:25:21,633 --> 01:25:24,225
- I followed him here.
- Thanks, kid.

1007
01:25:29,222 --> 01:25:30,067
Spaz?

1008
01:26:01,852 --> 01:26:03,242
Use your armor!

1009
01:26:08,552 --> 01:26:09,967
Concentrate!

1010
01:26:13,103 --> 01:26:14,870
Bite this!

1011
01:26:20,101 --> 01:26:21,726
Cut off his head!

1012
01:26:37,686 --> 01:26:39,563
You're gonna pay for this.

1013
01:26:41,273 --> 01:26:43,076
It's not over yet.

1014
01:26:43,638 --> 01:26:45,140
I'll gum you to death.

1015
01:26:45,160 --> 01:26:46,248
I'll bite ya!

1016
01:26:47,932 --> 01:26:51,117
Hey, Wanda, what do you think
about my little head, huh?

1017
01:26:55,225 --> 01:26:57,280
This is your last chance to join up.

1018
01:26:57,300 --> 01:26:58,374
Think about it.

1019
01:26:58,765 --> 01:26:59,732
Come on.

1020
01:27:05,263 --> 01:27:06,821
You'll pay for this.

1021
01:27:06,841 --> 01:27:09,051
Give my regards to your boss.

1022
01:27:09,498 --> 01:27:11,188
Tell him he's next.

1023
01:27:15,191 --> 01:27:17,126
Bow down, now.

1024
01:27:19,163 --> 01:27:23,023
I'm gonna die!

1025
01:27:23,065 --> 01:27:25,280
Not bad for a dead man.

1026
01:27:25,893 --> 01:27:28,745
Oh...
Beginner's luck.

1027
01:27:35,883 --> 01:27:38,520
Mr Fitzgerald, is it true that the
documents you've uncovered...

1028
01:27:38,540 --> 01:27:39,667
implicate Jason Wynn?

1029
01:27:39,687 --> 01:27:43,554
Yes, that's correct. For the past five
years, I unwittingly participated...

1030
01:27:43,574 --> 01:27:46,039
in Jason Wynn's illegal
manipulation of the A-6...

1031
01:27:46,059 --> 01:27:48,875
in order to further his own personal
ambitions for a worldwide power.

1032
01:27:48,895 --> 01:27:50,301
Sir, what caused you
so long to respond?

1033
01:27:50,342 --> 01:27:53,540
Mr Fitzgerald, the HEAT-16 bombs,
are they still a danger?

1034
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:56,519
The entire HEAT-16 weapon system
has already been destroyed.

1035
01:27:58,885 --> 01:28:00,603
Do you have any further comments?

1036
01:28:00,772 --> 01:28:02,752
Something I should have
done a long time ago.

1037
01:28:02,772 --> 01:28:05,045
The documents that I released
to all media outlets...

1038
01:28:05,065 --> 01:28:06,525
will take care of all the
rest of your questions.

1039
01:28:06,567 --> 01:28:07,544
Thank you.

1040
01:28:07,564 --> 01:28:10,400
Thank you. Natalie Ford
reporting live with CNB.

1041
01:28:48,142 --> 01:28:49,466
Spawn has stopped...

1042
01:28:49,486 --> 01:28:52,321
Malebolgia's plans to
destroy the Earth.

1043
01:28:53,504 --> 01:28:55,457
The choice has been made.

1044
01:28:57,513 --> 01:28:59,053
For now.

1045
01:36:07,493 --> 01:36:09,474
Synced with VisualSubSync.
