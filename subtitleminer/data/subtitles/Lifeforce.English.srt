1
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:45,398
August 9, 2:30 p.m.
Greenwich Mean Time.

2
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,736
The H.M.S. Churchill,
outward bound.

3
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:50,605
On board: a joint
British-American space team.

4
00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:55,046
Their mission: to intercept and study
the comet bearing Dr. Halley's name.

5
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:59,051
The Churchill is the first spacecraft
equipped with the Nerva engine.

6
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,917
It propels the Churchill
with constant acceleration...

7
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:05,651
enough to create Earth-type gravity for
the first time on an extended flight.

8
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:10,025
The Churchill is on course
for its rendezvous.

9
00:02:10,096 --> 00:02:12,860
- Sir, this is odd.
- What?

10
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:14,490
I'm getting a small radar
cross section...

11
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:17,730
just ahead of the nucleus
in the coma of the comet.

12
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:22,036
I've got it too. Check the length.
It's at the limit of my scan angle.

13
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:24,201
- What's going on?
- You run an equipment check?

14
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:25,904
Every five minutes.

15
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,880
- Radar states 150 miles.
- 150 miles what?

16
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:31,883
- Length.
- 150 miles long?

17
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:34,913
What's 150 miles long?

18
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,649
It's a radar trace.

19
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:40,250
- Something in the coma of the comet.
- Show me.

20
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:43,727
- E.G.R. is confirmed.
- Looks good.

21
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:45,229
E.G.R. is optimal.

22
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:46,856
Track three on three.

23
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:48,366
Roger.

24
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:51,369
What's its height?

25
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:54,736
I've got a vertical reading
of two miles at least.

26
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:57,173
Ambient temperature: six degrees.

27
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:59,609
Less than two percent traces
of manganese, titanium--

28
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,112
Try and raise base.

29
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:04,014
Tell them we have an artificial
object out here hidden--

30
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:07,849
- Are you sure you want to say "hidden"?
- It's located in the head of the comet.

31
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:10,685
Keep sending that
until they acknowledge.

32
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:12,520
Use a secured downlink.

33
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:15,618
Sorry, Commander, everything's
been swamped by the coma winds.

34
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,754
We can't get anything back to base.

35
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,855
How long is the blackout period?

36
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:21,958
All the way.

37
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,045
What are you gonna do?

38
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:37,548
Go on in.

39
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:42,183
We're only gonna get one chance,
Derebridge.

40
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:47,218
That thing won't be back
for another 76 years...

41
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:49,887
and we'll both be dead.

42
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:52,056
We have to take a look now.

43
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:05,106
- Shut down Nerva.
- Shutting down.

44
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:07,009
Down.

45
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:21,860
- Solar panels retracted.
- Check. Give me a readout, Bob.

46
00:04:57,263 --> 00:04:59,561
Executing E.V.A. maneuver.

47
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:15,339
Where do you suppose
this thing came from?

48
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:20,617
- Was it exploring the comet?
- Come on, guys, let's do it.

49
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:24,014
The surface looks badly pitted.

50
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:27,184
In that case,
it's been here a long time.

51
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,353
It's derelict, whatever it is.

52
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:32,523
Stand by, Churchill.
We're going in.

53
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:35,863
Roger, Carlsen.
We copy. We have you going in.

54
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:44,035
Churchill, it looks like
some giant artery, organic.

55
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,874
I almost have the feeling
I've been here before.

56
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,713
Oh, boy.

57
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:01,826
This is incredible.

58
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:05,159
I hope you can appreciate
the scale of this on the video.

59
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:07,825
Roger. We're getting it.
It's all on tape.

60
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:13,271
Oh, shit.

61
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:16,331
Whoa. Here they are.

62
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:26,484
Churchill...

63
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:29,612
it looks like we found the occupants
of the ship.

64
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:34,925
They look like giant bats.

65
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:49,800
- There must be hundreds of them.
- Thousands.

66
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:52,140
Dead, I hope.

67
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:10,318
Looks prehistoric.

68
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,205
It's completely desiccated.

69
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:29,438
- Crumbles.
- Y es, it would.

70
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:32,746
All the fluid's been lost
to space over the years.

71
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:44,052
We'll bag this one,
take it with us.

72
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,930
We're deploying
the specimen bag.

73
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:06,984
Jesus.

74
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:09,783
What the hell is that?

75
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:11,822
Commander...

76
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:14,257
the ship has just deployed a--

77
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:18,354
It looks like some sort
of big structure that's just unfolding.

78
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,955
It's enormous.

79
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,394
God, what is it?

80
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,876
We must get out of here.

81
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:34,845
Nobody's going anywhere.
Stay where you are.

82
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:39,514
Churchill, this is Carlsen.
What's happening out there?

83
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:41,280
The thing stopped opening.

84
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:45,586
The only way to describe it is
it's like a giant umbrella.

85
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:49,594
Good God.
It's absolutely enormous.

86
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:51,459
What's it doing now?

87
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:53,998
Nothing, sir.

88
00:08:57,937 --> 00:08:59,598
It's stopped opening.

89
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:01,902
It's just sitting there.

90
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:05,842
- Can you tell what it's made of?
- Not metal.

91
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:07,709
It's radar transparent.

92
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:11,612
Okay.

93
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:13,914
If it starts up again,
let me know.

94
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:16,386
Any activity out there.
You understand?

95
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:17,888
Y es, sir.

96
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:28,032
That's where we're going.

97
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,484
There's something there.

98
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:31,860
Commander, this is Churchill.

99
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:34,900
We're losing our signal.
We've lost V.T.R.

100
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,696
Come in, Commander!

101
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:58,056
Three bodies.

102
00:10:58,124 --> 00:11:00,183
Perfectly preserved.

103
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:05,622
They look to me
to be like an--

104
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:08,690
Something's happening to me.

105
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:11,202
What's wrong with me?

106
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:28,385
Commander, come in.

107
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:31,389
This is Churchill.
Do you copy?

108
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:39,056
They seem to be in some sort
of suspended animation or sleep.

109
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:40,598
Hold on.
We're coming down.

110
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:06,782
Churchill, if you read...

111
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:10,022
there are two nude males
and one female.

112
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:14,658
This is Churchill.
We have no picture. Come in, Tom.

113
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:19,637
Churchill,
I said we found a young girl.

114
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:22,572
"Girl"? You mean human?

115
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:25,041
Definitely humanoid.

116
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:27,045
I'd say she's perfect.

117
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:30,549
I've been in space for six months.
She looks perfect to me.

118
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:40,416
- Derebridge, what's wrong?
- What's wrong?

119
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:57,435
- How many do you want to take back?
- I say we take back all three...

120
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:00,673
and one of the dead things
in the other chamber.

121
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:04,546
Let's see if we can break them free.

122
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:27,537
Churchill, come in.
This is Mission Control, Great Britain.

123
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:29,540
Do you copy?

124
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:32,304
If they're going to pick us up,
they should get us this close.

125
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:34,608
Simply aren't receiving,
Dr. Bukovsky.

126
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,706
Automatic circuits don't even respond.

127
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:40,978
They're radio dead.

128
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:44,887
Christ, I hope it's just
their communications.

129
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:58,298
How's their orbit look?

130
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:01,806
You can see it's stable,
but they're slightly off.

131
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:03,307
They should have adjusted
coming in...

132
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:04,933
but they haven't.

133
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,443
What do you make of that?

134
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,878
It would appear that
they set their course...

135
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:12,384
just after they left the comet
and haven't updated it since.

136
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:22,089
- The Columbia?
- The Columbia.

137
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:25,358
We have a liftoff.

138
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,193
Tower cleared.

139
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,013
Control, this is Columbia.

140
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:47,109
Are we cleared
to initiate docking procedure?

141
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:49,711
Go ahead, Columbia.
You are looking good.

142
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:52,256
Stand by for soft dock.

143
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:54,858
Soft dock.

144
00:14:57,963 --> 00:14:59,396
Soft dock confirmed.

145
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:14,901
Columbia,
the ship's completely gutted.

146
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,464
Oh, my God.

147
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:20,774
Houston, we have a problem.
There's been a fire.

148
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:29,514
I'll take a look in the tug bay.
You two, try the top deck.

149
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,142
Columbia, they're all dead.

150
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:02,644
Nothing down here, Columbia.
I'm going into the tug bay.

151
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:07,424
I'll get the tapes.

152
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,823
Somner...

153
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,383
there's something you ought to see
in the tug bay.

154
00:17:58,177 --> 00:18:02,671
I see.
How did you open the girl's case?

155
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,477
We didn't, Minister.

156
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:08,350
We were talking about how to get it open
when it popped open of its own accord.

157
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,719
- Did you X-ray the crystal cases?
- We're not certain they're crystal.

158
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:15,248
The casings are not metallic.
I'm not even sure they're organic.

159
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:18,922
The casing is right there
in front of us without being there...

160
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:21,431
- if that makes any sense.
- And the bodies?

161
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:24,158
We're going to do
our first dissection now.

162
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:28,969
Provided, of course,
that Dr. Fallada agrees they're dead.

163
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:36,838
I don't know that I am qualified
to pass judgment on alien death.

164
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:39,179
You would agree that
they're less alive than we are?

165
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:45,355
Yesterday in Hong Kong,
gold closed lower.

166
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:48,291
In light trading
on European currency markets...

167
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,193
the pound closed mixed against
the dollar and West German marks.

168
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:56,525
There will be a full market report
after the late news.

169
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:59,935
This is James Graham
reporting from the city.

170
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:01,939
Now back to the newsroom.

171
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:11,113
Halley's Comet is now
dominating the northern sky...

172
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:13,651
stretching over 100 million miles
across the heavens...

173
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:16,882
occupying one-sixth
of the entire visible horizon.

174
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:19,253
On this exceptionally clear night...

175
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:22,987
a group of enthusiasts are commemorating
Dr. Edmund Halley's great prediction...

176
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:26,997
by holding an outdoor watching from
his original observatory at Greenwich.

177
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:28,999
Our viewers may be interested
to know...

178
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:32,764
that comets were once considered
to be hargingers of evil.

179
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,671
One of the earliest words
for comet was "disaster"...

180
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:38,073
which in Latin means "evil star."

181
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:42,170
It may indeed be an evil star
for the deep space probe Churchill.

182
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:45,876
There's still no word from Her Majesty's
government as to the fate of the crew...

183
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:47,782
whether they're alive or dead.

184
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,548
We can only await
further developments--

185
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,690
Use my body.

186
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:51,220
- Where's the girl?
- She's gone.

187
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,333
I saw her.

188
00:24:00,906 --> 00:24:02,737
She did that.

189
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:08,811
- Security.
- Hello. Professor Fallada here.

190
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,973
I'm calling
at Dr. Bukovsky's orders.

191
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:14,917
- Get me the duty security captain now.
- Yes, sir.

192
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:16,419
Don't worry.

193
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:19,855
A naked girl is not going
to get out of this complex.

194
00:24:57,496 --> 00:25:01,398
Four-nine to Control. You'll
never believe what I'm looking at.

195
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:07,601
- Control, can you say that again?
- I believe you heard me.

196
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:10,835
There's a girl on the loose
in the building. She must not leave.

197
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:13,571
Pardon me, but I thought you said
she was naked.

198
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:16,512
That's right. That's what I said.
Surely, you can find her.

199
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:18,515
Must be some kind of joke.

200
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:25,822
Don't believe it.

201
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,521
All right, miss,
just stay where you are.

202
00:25:30,595 --> 00:25:32,563
You heard them.
They said grab her.

203
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:35,691
Take it easy, mate.
She's not in her right mind.

204
00:25:35,767 --> 00:25:39,203
Control, we have located the girl
in the main lobby.

205
00:25:40,605 --> 00:25:42,436
That's it. Come on.

206
00:25:43,742 --> 00:25:45,767
- Yes?
- We've located the girl, sir.

207
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:48,244
- Where?
- She's downstairs in the main lobby.

208
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:50,110
Right.

209
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:54,515
She's in the main lobby.
You all right to go down there?

210
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,018
Nice and easy.

211
00:25:58,089 --> 00:26:01,718
Come on.
Come to me.

212
00:26:01,793 --> 00:26:03,761
Come to Daddy.

213
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:16,396
Make it stop.

214
00:26:16,474 --> 00:26:19,034
Come on!
Let's get her!

215
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:07,655
- Are you all right, mate?
- Y eah.

216
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:35,846
All nonmilitary personnel
please clear the area.

217
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:40,254
I repeat: Everybody who has
no business to be here...

218
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:44,261
please clear the area
for your own safety.

219
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,092
This is a police announcement.

220
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:52,900
Sorry, gentlemen,
no photographs, please.

221
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:56,202
It's all right.

222
00:27:56,274 --> 00:28:00,506
- Which of you is Dr. Bukovsky?
- I am.

223
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:03,706
- I'm Colonel Caine.
- From the S.A.S.?

224
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:07,775
That last remark is not for publication.
This is a D notice situation.

225
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:23,666
Not too close.

226
00:28:27,405 --> 00:28:31,000
And this was murder, you say?

227
00:28:36,414 --> 00:28:39,008
Tell me again
how the girl overpowered you.

228
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:42,685
She--

229
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:49,185
It was the most overwhelmingly
feminine presence I've ever encountered.

230
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:53,689
- I was drawn to her on a level that--
- Was it sexual?

231
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:57,701
Yes, overwhelmingly so.

232
00:28:57,769 --> 00:29:01,728
And horrible.
Loss of control.

233
00:29:01,806 --> 00:29:03,797
The guard was dead
when you came into the room?

234
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:07,242
- You found him as he is now?
- Yeah.

235
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:10,543
And the girl came from the ship
Churchill?

236
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:12,139
Uh-huh.

237
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:15,709
She spoke to you, in English?

238
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:17,311
That's right.

239
00:29:17,388 --> 00:29:20,152
How would she know English?

240
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:24,161
Going back, you say the ship's tapes
were destroyed in the fire.

241
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:26,163
They weren't destroyed
in the fire.

242
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:28,825
That's what we were told
to tell the public. They were erased.

243
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,333
"Erased"?

244
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:32,665
Also, the Churchill's escape pod
is missing.

245
00:29:32,737 --> 00:29:35,365
- Did someone escape?
- We don't know.

246
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,499
Unfortunately, the condition
of the bodies...

247
00:29:37,575 --> 00:29:40,169
make an accurate count
impossible.

248
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:42,509
Could the heat from the fire
have launched the pod?

249
00:29:46,584 --> 00:29:48,518
What started the fire?

250
00:29:51,156 --> 00:29:56,025
The ship's oxygen system ignited.
It was a terribly hot fire.

251
00:29:56,094 --> 00:30:00,963
Y et you say the three cases
containing the bodies were untouched.

252
00:30:01,032 --> 00:30:03,193
- That's correct.
- Where were they found?

253
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:05,532
In the bay
where the space tug was stored.

254
00:30:05,603 --> 00:30:07,696
Where everything else was charred.

255
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:12,038
Incredible, is it not?

256
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:19,610
- Have you examined the cases?
- Using every technique we have.

257
00:30:19,684 --> 00:30:21,914
X-ray scans of the cases
yield only blurred images.

258
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:26,889
-What does that mean?
-They're not precisely physical objects.

259
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:28,926
More like a force field.

260
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:33,054
We're a bit out of our depth here.
The whole thing is--

261
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:36,066
Yes, I know, incredible.

262
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:41,029
Have they done an autopsy yet
on the guard? I suppose not.

263
00:30:41,105 --> 00:30:42,538
What about your two other bodies?

264
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:47,535
Colonel, may I be excused?

265
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:50,240
I seem to be feeling
a little more nauseous than I thought.

266
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:51,748
Y es, of course.

267
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:03,394
I noticed from your door, Dr. Fallada,
that your area is biochemistry.

268
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:06,863
But I understand
your real interest is--

269
00:31:06,931 --> 00:31:09,195
Death, Colonel Caine.
Correct.

270
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:11,201
Thanatology is the name for it.

271
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:13,703
Death for you
is a bureaucratic problem.

272
00:31:13,771 --> 00:31:16,365
Who did it? When?
Why did they do it?

273
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:19,035
- Am I correct?
- And for you?

274
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:22,045
I'm fascinated by death itself:

275
00:31:22,113 --> 00:31:25,344
what happens as we die, when we die,
what happens after we die.

276
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:27,714
- You mean life after death?
- Yes.

277
00:31:27,785 --> 00:31:33,223
- Is there life after death?
- Do you really want to know?

278
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:41,690
But to answer your question,
yes, I think there is.

279
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:45,566
If I am correct, the lifeforce
is conserved always...

280
00:31:45,637 --> 00:31:47,605
and in all things,
even after death.

281
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:50,436
You think that applies
to what's happened here tonight?

282
00:31:50,508 --> 00:31:53,909
Yes, I do.

283
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:57,414
I think that girl, creature...

284
00:31:57,482 --> 00:32:00,178
drained energy, lifeforce...

285
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:04,847
partially from Bukovsky
and totally from the guard.

286
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:08,620
- A vampire?
- It could be described that way.

287
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:10,684
In a sense, we're all vampires.

288
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:14,323
We drain energy
from other life-forms.

289
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:17,527
The difference is one of degree.

290
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:20,469
That girl was no girl.

291
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:24,497
She is totally alien to this planet
and our life-form...

292
00:32:24,575 --> 00:32:26,668
and totally dangerous.

293
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:05,548
Jesus.

294
00:33:07,251 --> 00:33:11,187
- Do you believe those blokes are alive?
- I'm not paid to believe nothing.

295
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:16,026
I believe they're alive.

296
00:33:19,263 --> 00:33:21,424
Don't look bloody dead to me.

297
00:34:15,453 --> 00:34:18,286
We've had some trouble,
but everything's under control.

298
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:20,449
I think you better
come down here.

299
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:22,516
Yes, sir.
Very good, sir.

300
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:41,935
It would appear these two
are no longer dangerous.

301
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:46,450
There is certainly no possiblity
of doing a full autopsy on them.

302
00:34:46,517 --> 00:34:48,451
I would like
to examine the guard.

303
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:50,248
Have they started the autopsy
on the guard yet?

304
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:51,754
I believe so, sir.

305
00:34:54,992 --> 00:34:59,452
This is an autopsy on the body of a
young man, dead approximately two hours.

306
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:01,691
- Did you say he was about twenty?
- Y es, that's correct.

307
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:11,500
Get the colonel down here!

308
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:09,659
Put him in an isolation cell,
quickly!

309
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:30,036
I had no idea
it could be passed on.

310
00:37:30,114 --> 00:37:32,082
What do you suggest?

311
00:37:32,149 --> 00:37:34,549
I would recommend that you
place this body in another cell.

312
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:37,247
It was two hours ago
that the guard was attacked.

313
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:40,381
I won't be at all surprised
if we're seeing a pattern here.

314
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:42,392
- Do as he says, Kelly.
- Y es, sir.

315
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,394
Also, I want the two other male bodies
that were shot.

316
00:37:44,462 --> 00:37:46,396
Collect the pieces
and watch them.

317
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:49,627
- Get me the Home Secretary now.
- Sir.

318
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,362
- Call for the colonel, sir.
- Sir, you have a call.

319
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,333
I'll be right there.

320
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:02,538
They've just found a body in Hyde Park.
A naked girl.

321
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:05,138
They say she's
in an indescribable condition.

322
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:07,150
Could that be your girl?

323
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:10,814
- Well?
- That's not her.

324
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:12,822
Inspector,
what about the two boys?

325
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:15,859
They were in the park earlier, sir.

326
00:38:15,926 --> 00:38:20,363
We saw her, I think, earlier.

327
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:23,491
Any rate,
that looks like her hair.

328
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:25,296
- What a mess.
- Was she alone?

329
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:27,394
No, that's why we noticed her.

330
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:30,497
She was with a dark-haired girl,
real good-looking and all.

331
00:38:30,574 --> 00:38:32,439
Didn't have a lot
of clothes on either.

332
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:34,444
We thought they might be--
Well, you know.

333
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:37,345
Y es. Did you see where
the dark-haired girl went?

334
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:40,077
No, we didn't.

335
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,449
We angled on back
to see if maybe we could...

336
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,683
you know,
see them doing something.

337
00:38:45,756 --> 00:38:47,883
- That's when we found her.
- How long ago was that?

338
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:50,950
- Half an hour ago.
- This lad phoned us, and we called you.

339
00:38:51,028 --> 00:38:53,155
Y es. Thank you, lnspector.

340
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,798
Obviously, the work of the girl.

341
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:01,702
Could we have this body sent back
to the center with the others?

342
00:39:01,772 --> 00:39:03,706
Y es, I suppose that's a good idea.

343
00:39:03,774 --> 00:39:06,299
Inspector, let me know
if you find anything else.

344
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:08,971
- We'll be taking her back with us.
- Very good, sir.

345
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:13,115
Now she has clothes.

346
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,286
There's something
I want you to see, sir.

347
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:31,925
Dr. Hans Fallada, Sir Percy
Hestlestine, the Home Secretary.

348
00:39:32,002 --> 00:39:34,994
You're just in time.

349
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:37,063
It's exactly two hours.

350
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,853
This is the guard who was originally
overcome by the space girl.

351
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:31,486
As I feared,
once transformed...

352
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:34,190
the victims need regular infusions
of energy...

353
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:36,756
- otherwise--
- Otherwise what?

354
00:41:00,524 --> 00:41:04,824
Oh, my God. Dear God.

355
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:10,824
And we have the pathologist
who was attacked by the guard.

356
00:41:20,277 --> 00:41:23,178
- See?
- He, too, needs feeding.

357
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:43,189
The same thing will happen
to that girl we found in the park...

358
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:44,700
in about one hour.

359
00:43:06,116 --> 00:43:09,779
Good Lord! Goodness!

360
00:43:16,393 --> 00:43:17,826
She's the last?

361
00:43:17,895 --> 00:43:20,557
- Have there been any further reports?
- No, sir.

362
00:43:20,631 --> 00:43:23,122
We're set up to get the calls here
the instant one comes in.

363
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,963
- What?
- Nothing.

364
00:43:25,035 --> 00:43:28,664
You say these creatures
were brought back from the Churchill?

365
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:31,731
Yes, sir, but not this one.
She's a victim of the creatures.

366
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:34,972
Yes, but where did
the Churchill acquire them?

367
00:43:35,045 --> 00:43:37,343
We have no way of determining that
at present.

368
00:43:37,414 --> 00:43:39,575
- Perhaps that's all changing.
- What?

369
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:42,414
I've just received a call
from the J.P.L. in Pasadena.

370
00:43:42,486 --> 00:43:44,750
The goldstone tracking disc
has just picked up something...

371
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:49,418
they think is Churchill's escape pod
reentering the Earth's atmosphere.

372
00:43:49,493 --> 00:43:52,155
- Where?
- Texas.

373
00:44:26,096 --> 00:44:29,554
Where?
Walter Reed Army Hospital?

374
00:44:29,633 --> 00:44:33,000
Is he hurt? Just exhausted.

375
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:35,004
Get him the hell over here!

376
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:40,143
Colonel Carlsen?
They're expecting you, sir.

377
00:44:42,646 --> 00:44:44,079
Colonel Carlsen, sir.

378
00:44:45,315 --> 00:44:46,748
Tom.

379
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:53,289
I thought you were dead.

380
00:44:54,992 --> 00:44:58,894
Allow me to introduce Colonel Caine
of the Special Air Services.

381
00:44:58,962 --> 00:45:00,395
How do you do?

382
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:02,932
- You already know Dr. Fallada.
- Colonel.

383
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:06,135
Take a seat.

384
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,674
I'm sorry to drag you over here
like this.

385
00:45:12,743 --> 00:45:15,803
I'm sure you'd rather be recuperating
with a pretty nurse.

386
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:21,074
We've got to know what happened
on the Churchill.

387
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:22,709
Yes, of course.

388
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:29,423
It may be very difficult
for you...

389
00:45:29,493 --> 00:45:32,087
to accept what
I'm going to say.

390
00:45:32,162 --> 00:45:35,256
We'll have very little difficulty
believing anything you have to tell us.

391
00:45:35,332 --> 00:45:38,631
- Do go on.
- You know something?

392
00:45:38,702 --> 00:45:41,728
There was a fire
aboard the Churchill.

393
00:45:41,805 --> 00:45:44,535
You might be interested to know that
the bodies of the three humanoids...

394
00:45:44,608 --> 00:45:46,576
were not destroyed in that fire.

395
00:45:46,643 --> 00:45:49,111
They survived in their cases.

396
00:45:49,179 --> 00:45:52,410
They were brought down here to London,
and the female has escaped.

397
00:45:52,483 --> 00:45:54,417
She's killed three people already.

398
00:45:55,886 --> 00:45:57,376
Oh, my God.

399
00:45:58,989 --> 00:46:01,583
So whatever you have to tell us
is rather pressing.

400
00:46:01,658 --> 00:46:04,627
Please, tell us what happened.

401
00:46:07,397 --> 00:46:09,991
We found the bodies
aboard the alien spacecraft.

402
00:46:10,067 --> 00:46:11,466
What alien spacecraft?

403
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:16,732
Colonel,
take it from the beginning.

404
00:46:16,807 --> 00:46:21,005
Assume we know nothing,
which is understating the matter.

405
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:26,211
We approached within 9,000 miles
of Halley's Comet...

406
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:32,354
when we detected an object
in the comet's coma.

407
00:46:32,422 --> 00:46:37,359
After we discovered the bodies,
we transferred them to the Churchill.

408
00:46:37,427 --> 00:46:41,454
We have the three humanoid creatures
and one of the bat-like things.

409
00:46:41,532 --> 00:46:44,660
This is Churchill.
We copy. Welcome back.

410
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,669
Have you gotten through
to Earth yet, Rawlings?

411
00:46:46,737 --> 00:46:50,036
No, sir, and the tail
of the comet's heating up.

412
00:46:54,912 --> 00:46:58,279
- What's the matter, Derebridge?
- I don't know, Tom.

413
00:46:58,348 --> 00:47:00,111
I feel drained.

414
00:47:00,184 --> 00:47:01,651
Do you?

415
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:06,047
I feel invigorated.
You okay?

416
00:47:07,257 --> 00:47:10,852
- Yeah. I'm fine.
- Okay.

417
00:47:14,097 --> 00:47:16,657
Everybody back
to their stations.

418
00:47:17,968 --> 00:47:19,902
Let's get the hell out of here.

419
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:27,739
On the trip back to Earth,
the crew began to die...

420
00:47:27,811 --> 00:47:29,745
one by one.

421
00:47:34,952 --> 00:47:36,476
Rawlings...

422
00:47:36,553 --> 00:47:38,544
the radio officer,
was the first to go.

423
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:53,061
Rawlings denied any knowledge
of what he had done.

424
00:47:53,136 --> 00:47:55,195
I don't remember.

425
00:47:59,109 --> 00:48:02,601
Besides myself, you're the only one
who has been up here in the last hour.

426
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:06,641
I've been feeling weak recently...

427
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:09,151
not myself.

428
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:12,211
Just don't remember.

429
00:48:28,338 --> 00:48:31,136
We found Rawlings' body
the next day.

430
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:41,583
Exactly how...

431
00:48:41,652 --> 00:48:43,950
did he die, Colonel?

432
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:46,990
The life just drained out of him.

433
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:53,729
One by one...

434
00:48:56,833 --> 00:48:58,858
the rest of the crew
began to die.

435
00:49:02,572 --> 00:49:04,005
Somehow...

436
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:08,444
I don't know how...

437
00:49:11,148 --> 00:49:12,809
I held out.

438
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:19,380
It just seemed
to be a matter of will.

439
00:49:21,091 --> 00:49:23,025
I always thought--

440
00:49:27,431 --> 00:49:28,864
The girl--

441
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:33,467
Y es? The girl?

442
00:49:39,242 --> 00:49:41,642
I can't remember.

443
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:57,055
What I remember next...

444
00:49:57,127 --> 00:50:00,324
is the view
out of the observation window...

445
00:50:00,397 --> 00:50:02,695
coming into Earth's orbit.

446
00:50:04,468 --> 00:50:07,767
I couldn't expose the world
to what we'd brought back with us.

447
00:51:28,485 --> 00:51:30,817
I was determined
to destroy them all.

448
00:51:57,948 --> 00:52:00,712
It was the hardest thing I ever did.

449
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:03,014
We understand.

450
00:52:03,086 --> 00:52:05,020
It must have taken great courage
to try and make--

451
00:52:05,088 --> 00:52:07,022
No, you don't understand.

452
00:52:08,225 --> 00:52:11,422
Part of me didn't want to leave.

453
00:52:11,495 --> 00:52:14,521
She killed all my friends,
and I still didn't want to leave.

454
00:52:15,765 --> 00:52:17,960
Leaving her was the hardest thing
I ever did.

455
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:25,036
Colonel Carlsen looks exhausted to me.

456
00:52:25,108 --> 00:52:28,441
We should allow him to get some sleep,
continue with this later.

457
00:52:28,512 --> 00:52:29,945
Very well.

458
00:52:32,182 --> 00:52:33,615
Thank you, Colonel.

459
00:53:00,644 --> 00:53:03,738
NASA tracking and ours...

460
00:53:03,813 --> 00:53:07,613
have just reported an unusual structure
leaving Halley's Comet.

461
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:09,117
It's headed for us.

462
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:10,653
What is it?

463
00:53:11,788 --> 00:53:13,380
Radar ranging reports the object...

464
00:53:13,456 --> 00:53:17,392
is a needlelike shape,
150 miles long.

465
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:19,928
Its present course projects out
into a perfect Earth orbit...

466
00:53:19,996 --> 00:53:22,931
in a little more than two days.

467
00:53:22,999 --> 00:53:25,934
I've just received a call
from the Prime Minister.

468
00:53:27,237 --> 00:53:29,432
There's going to be a meeting
at Downing Street.

469
00:53:29,506 --> 00:53:31,133
Prime Minister wants answers.

470
00:53:57,834 --> 00:53:59,768
Close your eyes.

471
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:09,878
You're giving me your life.

472
00:54:19,623 --> 00:54:21,250
You're taking it.

473
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:29,554
You're draining me.

474
00:55:29,626 --> 00:55:32,561
You're taking too much of me.

475
00:55:59,322 --> 00:56:01,449
It was just a dream.

476
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:05,358
- What dream?
- The girl-- She visited me.

477
00:56:05,428 --> 00:56:07,521
Visited you? How?

478
00:56:07,597 --> 00:56:09,030
In my mind.

479
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:17,433
She has some kind
of mental contact with me.

480
00:56:17,507 --> 00:56:19,065
She's draining me.

481
00:56:19,142 --> 00:56:21,076
Tell us about the dream.

482
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:24,907
I can't. It's gone.

483
00:56:24,981 --> 00:56:26,812
It's faded.

484
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:28,316
I can't remember.

485
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:30,012
Have you ever been hypnotized?

486
00:56:32,188 --> 00:56:34,452
Do you mind if I try?

487
00:56:34,524 --> 00:56:37,459
Yeah, let's try it.

488
00:56:37,527 --> 00:56:42,658
- Not now. He's too exhausted.
- Fine. In the morning.

489
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:46,759
Just stare at it until your eyes
feel tired, then close them.

490
00:56:46,836 --> 00:56:51,967
You'll feel very tired,
very sleepy.

491
00:56:52,041 --> 00:56:57,877
She seems to speak to me
in my dreams.

492
00:57:00,283 --> 00:57:01,716
She--

493
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:04,553
The girl--

494
00:57:04,621 --> 00:57:06,054
I feel--

495
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:10,548
What do you feel for her?

496
00:57:10,627 --> 00:57:13,289
I feel very...

497
00:57:13,363 --> 00:57:15,160
close to her.

498
00:57:15,231 --> 00:57:18,325
Is she in touch with you?

499
00:57:18,401 --> 00:57:20,892
I feel...

500
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:23,564
as if my mind...

501
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:26,234
is not entirely my own.

502
00:57:26,309 --> 00:57:29,836
If she is in contact
with your mind...

503
00:57:29,913 --> 00:57:32,609
perhaps you are in contact
with hers.

504
00:57:32,682 --> 00:57:34,206
Can you see her?

505
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:36,946
Can you see where she is?

506
00:57:37,884 --> 00:57:39,317
Y es.

507
00:57:39,386 --> 00:57:41,411
Where is she now?

508
00:57:41,488 --> 00:57:44,924
A place.
I don't know the name of it.

509
00:57:44,991 --> 00:57:46,583
She's walking.

510
00:57:47,994 --> 00:57:50,588
She has a different face...

511
00:57:50,664 --> 00:57:52,256
but it's her.

512
00:57:52,332 --> 00:57:54,596
"A different face"?
How can that be?

513
00:57:54,668 --> 00:57:57,603
She's using a different body.

514
00:57:57,671 --> 00:58:00,765
- What is she doing?
- She's looking for a man.

515
00:58:00,841 --> 00:58:02,672
What man?

516
00:58:02,742 --> 00:58:06,269
Any man.
A healthy man.

517
00:58:06,346 --> 00:58:09,440
Does she intend to kill him?

518
00:58:09,516 --> 00:58:12,110
- Why not?
- She's afraid of being caught.

519
00:58:12,185 --> 00:58:15,450
- How could she be caught?
- The body would give her away.

520
00:58:15,522 --> 00:58:17,615
What is she hoping to do?

521
00:58:17,691 --> 00:58:20,285
She wants to...

522
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:23,124
draw some energy from him.

523
00:58:23,196 --> 00:58:24,788
Not enough to kill him.

524
00:58:24,865 --> 00:58:28,301
- She can do that?
- Y es.

525
00:58:28,368 --> 00:58:31,166
There's another mind.

526
00:58:31,238 --> 00:58:33,297
Y es.

527
00:58:33,373 --> 00:58:35,102
The girl's name...

528
00:58:35,175 --> 00:58:36,802
is Ellen.

529
00:58:36,877 --> 00:58:38,811
There are two people
in one body?

530
00:58:38,879 --> 00:58:41,370
Two minds?

531
00:58:41,448 --> 00:58:44,178
Ellen and the vampire?

532
00:58:44,251 --> 00:58:45,684
Yes.

533
00:58:48,321 --> 00:58:50,915
She's watching a man.

534
00:58:50,991 --> 00:58:52,754
What is the man doing?

535
00:58:52,826 --> 00:58:57,422
He's parked,
doing something with his car.

536
00:58:59,232 --> 00:59:01,427
Get the license number.

537
00:59:01,501 --> 00:59:04,937
Can you see the license number
of his car?

538
00:59:05,005 --> 00:59:06,438
Y es.

539
00:59:07,741 --> 00:59:09,174
Read it out.

540
00:59:09,242 --> 00:59:11,437
FMC...

541
00:59:13,113 --> 00:59:16,048
129E...

542
00:59:16,116 --> 00:59:18,846
or R.

543
00:59:18,919 --> 00:59:21,786
What is the make of the car?

544
00:59:23,690 --> 00:59:26,124
A white Volvo.

545
00:59:29,362 --> 00:59:31,660
What is she doing now?

546
00:59:33,033 --> 00:59:34,591
They're driving now.

547
00:59:34,668 --> 00:59:37,569
Does she ask him his name?

548
00:59:37,637 --> 00:59:42,574
She's pulling her skirt...

549
00:59:43,977 --> 00:59:45,740
over her knees.

550
00:59:46,813 --> 00:59:48,246
She's--

551
00:59:49,316 --> 00:59:50,749
He's...

552
00:59:52,152 --> 00:59:54,086
putting his...

553
00:59:56,656 --> 01:00:00,922
hand on her leg.

554
01:00:16,209 --> 01:00:19,610
FMC129E or possibly R...

555
01:00:19,679 --> 01:00:21,772
belonging to a white Volvo.

556
01:00:21,848 --> 01:00:24,612
The driver of the car
picked up a girl named Ellen.

557
01:00:24,684 --> 01:00:27,619
I have to know who the girl is
and where we can find her.

558
01:00:27,687 --> 01:00:29,780
She's connected with the case.

559
01:00:29,856 --> 01:00:32,950
I can't explain over an open line.
Thank you.

560
01:00:34,527 --> 01:00:36,791
Do you think he's telling the truth
about the girl?

561
01:00:36,863 --> 01:00:38,797
We'll soon see.

562
01:00:38,865 --> 01:00:43,234
How brilliant, if she is moving
from body to body, mind to mind...

563
01:00:43,303 --> 01:00:46,898
taking only a small amount
of energy from each victim.

564
01:00:46,973 --> 01:00:49,908
It would make sense
that we're finding no new victims.

565
01:00:49,976 --> 01:00:51,944
She's hoping to leave no trail.

566
01:00:52,012 --> 01:00:56,415
If the girl is no longer in her
original body, where is her body?

567
01:00:57,484 --> 01:01:00,578
- Hidden.
- Let's find it.

568
01:01:01,821 --> 01:01:04,085
Supposing you're right
about all of this.

569
01:01:04,157 --> 01:01:07,649
What about that ship up there?
What's it doing?

570
01:01:07,727 --> 01:01:11,959
We can't know that,
but we've got to assume the worst.

571
01:01:12,032 --> 01:01:14,091
Maybe they're like
the vampires of legend.

572
01:01:14,167 --> 01:01:16,101
How's that?

573
01:01:16,169 --> 01:01:19,935
They would carry their Earth
with them, in their coffins.

574
01:01:20,006 --> 01:01:21,997
Wouldn't they?

575
01:01:24,344 --> 01:01:27,438
- We have the feed from Hawaii.
- Here it comes.

576
01:01:27,514 --> 01:01:33,350
- Put it on screen number one.
- Coming in 240,000 miles.

577
01:01:34,954 --> 01:01:38,082
My God, it's immense.

578
01:01:57,477 --> 01:02:01,573
Hugh, do you have that skin tissue
sample I asked for?

579
01:02:01,648 --> 01:02:03,411
Good.

580
01:02:03,483 --> 01:02:06,418
Of course, I'll follow
containment procedure.

581
01:02:06,486 --> 01:02:07,919
He's here now.

582
01:02:07,987 --> 01:02:10,421
Send in that soldier, please.

583
01:02:13,827 --> 01:02:15,260
Thank you.

584
01:02:49,462 --> 01:02:53,558
One moment, Sergeant.
Thank you for coming.

585
01:02:53,633 --> 01:02:55,897
I'll be with you shortly.

586
01:03:05,979 --> 01:03:08,413
Bloody awful job, chasing that car.

587
01:03:08,481 --> 01:03:11,575
It belongs to a man named
Ned Price who lives in Y orkshire.

588
01:03:11,651 --> 01:03:14,586
- We have him under detention now.
- What about the girl?

589
01:03:14,654 --> 01:03:18,090
The girl he picked up
was a nurse named Ellen, as you said.

590
01:03:18,158 --> 01:03:20,752
Ellen something.
He doesn't know her other name.

591
01:03:20,827 --> 01:03:24,923
He dropped her at Thurlstone Hospital
after spending the afternoon with her.

592
01:03:24,998 --> 01:03:29,435
He was reluctant to talk about it.
The man's totally exhausted.

593
01:03:29,502 --> 01:03:32,767
Isn't Thurlstone an asylum
of some sort?

594
01:03:32,839 --> 01:03:35,899
Y es, for the criminally insane.

595
01:03:57,797 --> 01:04:02,734
How do you do? I'm Dr. Armstrong,
director of the hospital.

596
01:04:02,802 --> 01:04:04,736
Come with me to my office.

597
01:04:09,309 --> 01:04:12,073
- It's a cold night.
- Bitterly cold.

598
01:04:13,146 --> 01:04:15,910
This is the nurses' house.

599
01:04:15,982 --> 01:04:18,746
Ellen Donaldson is number five.

600
01:04:18,818 --> 01:04:20,410
Thank you.

601
01:04:20,487 --> 01:04:22,921
Shouldn't I come up
and introduce you?

602
01:04:22,989 --> 01:04:24,923
- I'd rather you didn't.
- Come along, Dr. Armstrong.

603
01:04:24,991 --> 01:04:27,425
You and I have several matters
to discuss.

604
01:04:32,665 --> 01:04:34,428
Yes? Who is it?

605
01:04:34,501 --> 01:04:37,527
My name's Colin Caine.
Dr. Armstrong brought me over.

606
01:04:37,604 --> 01:04:40,539
I'd like to talk to you.
May I come in?

607
01:04:49,949 --> 01:04:51,382
Yes?

608
01:04:53,286 --> 01:04:55,720
- What do you want?
- My name is Colin Caine.

609
01:04:55,788 --> 01:04:58,723
This is Colonel Carlsen,
United States Air Force.

610
01:04:58,791 --> 01:05:03,228
May we come in and talk to you?
We have seen Dr. Armstrong.

611
01:05:12,305 --> 01:05:14,239
May I sit down?

612
01:05:17,310 --> 01:05:21,144
I want to ask about the man you spent
the afternoon with, Ned Price.

613
01:05:23,816 --> 01:05:26,649
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-I think you do.

614
01:05:26,719 --> 01:05:29,813
- Let me see your hand.
- Beg your pardon?

615
01:05:34,294 --> 01:05:36,285
You're in there, aren't you?

616
01:05:38,565 --> 01:05:41,125
- I don't know.
- Tell me.

617
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:49,374
It's gone from her.
It's in another body now.

618
01:05:49,442 --> 01:05:53,208
- How do you know that?
- I can see it, in her mind.

619
01:05:54,914 --> 01:05:58,714
She's resisting.
I'll have to force her to tell me.

620
01:05:58,785 --> 01:06:02,721
Despite appearances,
this woman is a masochist.

621
01:06:02,789 --> 01:06:04,256
An extreme masochist.

622
01:06:04,324 --> 01:06:06,724
She wants me
to force the name out of her.

623
01:06:06,793 --> 01:06:09,557
She wants me to hurt her.

624
01:06:09,629 --> 01:06:14,293
I can see the images in her mind.
Do you want to stay?

625
01:06:14,367 --> 01:06:18,463
- Otherwise, wait outside!
- Not at all. I am a natural voyeur.

626
01:06:23,343 --> 01:06:25,277
Are you in there?

627
01:06:34,153 --> 01:06:35,643
Are you there?

628
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:41,993
Let go.

629
01:06:43,262 --> 01:06:44,786
Now.

630
01:07:37,483 --> 01:07:38,916
Well?

631
01:07:38,985 --> 01:07:41,078
I've got a physical description.

632
01:07:48,327 --> 01:07:50,761
You better send someone
to look after Nurse Donaldson.

633
01:07:50,830 --> 01:07:52,263
Is she all right?

634
01:07:52,331 --> 01:07:54,822
If I described one of the inmates
to you, could you identify him?

635
01:07:54,901 --> 01:07:56,368
Possibly.

636
01:07:56,436 --> 01:08:00,668
Big man, fat, gray hair,
birthmark on his face.

637
01:08:00,740 --> 01:08:04,733
Jeffrey Sykes, the child murderer.
Where did you get his description?

638
01:08:04,811 --> 01:08:09,271
- Where is he now?
- He's in solitary confinement.

639
01:08:09,348 --> 01:08:10,975
He's been naughty.

640
01:08:11,050 --> 01:08:13,951
- What is this about?
- What we're looking for has moved.

641
01:08:14,020 --> 01:08:17,114
- We could be here some time.
- I better call London.

642
01:08:17,190 --> 01:08:19,954
- May I use your telephone, Doctor?
- Certainly.

643
01:08:20,026 --> 01:08:23,462
- We have to see Sykes now.
- Couldn't this wait until the morning?

644
01:08:24,864 --> 01:08:26,957
All right, I'll arrange it.

645
01:08:27,033 --> 01:08:29,297
Anything to oblige, Commander.

646
01:08:35,875 --> 01:08:37,900
I wish this were not so mysterious.

647
01:08:37,977 --> 01:08:41,413
If the police are involved,
haven't I a right to know?

648
01:08:41,481 --> 01:08:44,575
If you're going to start
messing about with my patients--

649
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:49,918
Dr. Armstrong, I sympathize
with your position, of course.

650
01:08:49,989 --> 01:08:54,085
However, I can tell you
it is a matter of national security.

651
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:55,593
I see.

652
01:08:55,661 --> 01:08:58,755
But don't you think
that I should be present...

653
01:08:58,831 --> 01:09:00,924
to represent the interests
of my patient?

654
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,763
- You see--
- Can I talk to you for a second?

655
01:09:02,835 --> 01:09:04,268
Of course.

656
01:09:05,371 --> 01:09:08,101
The man has the l.Q.
of a child of four.

657
01:09:08,174 --> 01:09:11,769
That's a decision I shall have
to defer to Colonel Caine.

658
01:09:11,844 --> 01:09:15,109
Yes, of course, you can come along.
Can we start now?

659
01:09:15,181 --> 01:09:19,174
- What are you going to do to him?
- I'd like to hypnotize him.

660
01:09:23,022 --> 01:09:24,614
What's that?

661
01:09:24,690 --> 01:09:26,624
Pentothal and morphine.

662
01:09:26,692 --> 01:09:30,458
Recommended for pre-hypnosis
and patient management.

663
01:09:41,474 --> 01:09:45,240
Well, he seems quiet.

664
01:09:45,311 --> 01:09:47,575
- We're ready when you are.
- Lamson.

665
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:49,080
Sir.

666
01:10:12,338 --> 01:10:14,431
Can the injection be dangerous?

667
01:10:14,507 --> 01:10:16,702
He should have no difficulty
tolerating it.

668
01:10:16,776 --> 01:10:18,835
There's always a risk, sir.

669
01:10:18,911 --> 01:10:20,879
May I have that?

670
01:10:22,748 --> 01:10:24,613
I'll wake him up.

671
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:29,285
- What are you doing?
- Stay where you are.

672
01:10:29,355 --> 01:10:32,620
He's sick, Lamson.
Help us. I can't explain now.

673
01:10:35,962 --> 01:10:37,395
There's our killer, Sir Percy.

674
01:11:06,993 --> 01:11:09,325
It's madness.

675
01:11:10,529 --> 01:11:12,895
I want to question him.
Where can we take him?

676
01:11:12,965 --> 01:11:14,432
Up the ramp, sir.

677
01:11:33,686 --> 01:11:35,779
We need to be alone.

678
01:11:44,463 --> 01:11:46,454
How did you know it was him?

679
01:11:46,532 --> 01:11:50,901
In the nurses' quarters,
he touched me on the shoulder.

680
01:11:50,970 --> 01:11:52,665
I saw into his mind.

681
01:11:53,806 --> 01:11:55,239
What?

682
01:11:55,308 --> 01:11:58,744
The colonel is able to see
into the minds of people...

683
01:11:58,811 --> 01:12:02,645
who have been possessed
by the girl creature, sir.

684
01:12:02,715 --> 01:12:07,846
It happens when I touch them.
Let's get him on the table.

685
01:12:16,662 --> 01:12:18,095
How--

686
01:12:19,332 --> 01:12:21,596
How do you know
she's still inside Armstrong?

687
01:12:21,667 --> 01:12:23,726
What's to prevent her
from moving to someone else?

688
01:12:23,803 --> 01:12:25,430
She's trapped.

689
01:12:26,672 --> 01:12:28,469
I can feel that.

690
01:12:28,541 --> 01:12:30,099
Are you sure?

691
01:12:37,183 --> 01:12:39,242
- Lamson.
- Sir?

692
01:12:39,318 --> 01:12:44,517
- Bring me another dose of the drug.
- One dose is usually enough.

693
01:12:44,590 --> 01:12:48,151
This is not a usual situation.
How long does this stuff last?

694
01:12:48,227 --> 01:12:51,253
A dose like that?
A couple of hours.

695
01:12:51,330 --> 01:12:54,390
We'll definitely need more.

696
01:12:54,467 --> 01:12:57,129
- Bring me three doses.
- Three?

697
01:12:57,203 --> 01:13:01,162
I'll take responsibility.
Just get on with it.

698
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:03,071
Y es, sir.

699
01:13:04,977 --> 01:13:06,569
Is a second dose safe?

700
01:13:06,645 --> 01:13:08,738
Surely it can strain his heart.

701
01:13:08,814 --> 01:13:13,911
Look, you don't know
what we're dealing with here.

702
01:13:13,986 --> 01:13:18,423
If he slips out from under,
she'll escape.

703
01:13:34,006 --> 01:13:35,940
Can you hear me?

704
01:13:38,277 --> 01:13:41,713
If you can hear me,
just say yes.

705
01:13:46,919 --> 01:13:50,218
It won't let me...

706
01:13:52,458 --> 01:13:53,891
talk to you.

707
01:14:15,981 --> 01:14:18,245
Can you see
what's holding you prisoner?

708
01:14:21,821 --> 01:14:24,756
Yes. She--

709
01:14:24,824 --> 01:14:27,918
Tell her she has to talk to me!

710
01:14:28,994 --> 01:14:30,427
Yes?

711
01:14:32,832 --> 01:14:35,096
I brought the Pentothal.

712
01:14:35,167 --> 01:14:37,032
Thanks. That will be all.

713
01:14:44,443 --> 01:14:45,876
Hold him.

714
01:14:53,452 --> 01:14:54,942
There's no need for that.

715
01:15:13,939 --> 01:15:17,875
You in there?
Can you still hear me?

716
01:15:20,312 --> 01:15:23,179
Can you get into his mind,
her mind?

717
01:15:23,249 --> 01:15:24,978
Not with this drug.
It's like a wall.

718
01:15:25,050 --> 01:15:27,746
Perhaps you've given him too much.

719
01:15:27,820 --> 01:15:29,287
Shut up!

720
01:15:34,160 --> 01:15:36,924
Listen, you bitch...

721
01:15:36,996 --> 01:15:39,965
I'll keep you in this state
for weeks if I have to.

722
01:15:40,032 --> 01:15:41,659
Now, you talk to me.

723
01:15:41,734 --> 01:15:43,668
Carlsen, be with me.

724
01:15:44,937 --> 01:15:48,134
- What do you want from me?
- I love you.

725
01:15:52,077 --> 01:15:53,874
What are you?

726
01:15:53,946 --> 01:15:57,541
Why are you so human, so perfect?

727
01:15:58,651 --> 01:16:00,619
What are the bird creatures
on the ship?

728
01:16:00,686 --> 01:16:03,553
Our bodies are unimportant.

729
01:16:03,622 --> 01:16:07,581
As you and your men approached
in your ship...

730
01:16:07,660 --> 01:16:10,060
we changed them for you.

731
01:16:10,129 --> 01:16:12,791
We entered your minds...

732
01:16:12,865 --> 01:16:15,561
and found there new bodies.

733
01:16:15,634 --> 01:16:18,194
I took my shape from your mind.

734
01:16:19,271 --> 01:16:22,263
I took your language.

735
01:16:22,341 --> 01:16:25,071
I became the woman I found there...

736
01:16:25,144 --> 01:16:29,547
in your deepest thoughts,
your deepest needs.

737
01:16:30,816 --> 01:16:34,149
I am the feminine in your mind.

738
01:16:40,092 --> 01:16:42,686
Where are you?

739
01:16:42,761 --> 01:16:44,194
Where's your body?

740
01:16:45,397 --> 01:16:47,524
Let me go!

741
01:16:54,573 --> 01:16:56,336
Touch me, Carlsen.

742
01:18:33,539 --> 01:18:35,473
- It's already spreading.
- How?

743
01:18:35,541 --> 01:18:37,566
- You didn't stop it. It's too late.
- That's impossible.

744
01:18:37,643 --> 01:18:39,577
We've only been half a step
behind her all the way.

745
01:18:39,645 --> 01:18:41,579
This gentleman stopped breathing.

746
01:18:43,015 --> 01:18:44,949
There's no pulse either.

747
01:18:55,327 --> 01:18:56,760
I think his neck is broken.

748
01:19:00,833 --> 01:19:04,269
Prepare a stretcher for Sir Percy
and one for Dr. Armstrong.

749
01:19:04,336 --> 01:19:06,600
Prepare all your remaining doses
of the drug for travel.

750
01:19:06,672 --> 01:19:08,105
Yes, sir.

751
01:19:15,347 --> 01:19:18,783
You said the thing hadn't stopped,
it was still spreading.

752
01:19:18,851 --> 01:19:22,116
- Why did you say that?
- I don't know.

753
01:19:22,187 --> 01:19:25,623
Could the girl have been deliberately
leading us away from London?

754
01:19:25,691 --> 01:19:27,852
Did we find all of her victims?

755
01:19:29,128 --> 01:19:32,097
If there are others
besides the girl in the park--

756
01:19:32,164 --> 01:19:35,065
- The thing would spread.
- In a chain reaction...

757
01:19:35,134 --> 01:19:37,398
geometrically,
until, by now--

758
01:19:39,104 --> 01:19:40,537
Christ.

759
01:20:14,006 --> 01:20:17,772
Lieutenant, can we use the radio
to reach the S.R.C. in London?

760
01:20:17,843 --> 01:20:21,279
Just a moment, sir.
There's something coming through.

761
01:20:21,346 --> 01:20:23,712
It is the S.R.C.
for you and Carlsen.

762
01:20:27,019 --> 01:20:28,452
Go ahead.

763
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:31,455
Can you hear me?

764
01:20:31,523 --> 01:20:34,617
Fallada, speak up!
I can't hear you!

765
01:20:35,694 --> 01:20:38,720
The two males didn't die.

766
01:20:38,797 --> 01:20:41,391
They jumped to the bodies
of the two soldiers who shot them...

767
01:20:41,467 --> 01:20:44,903
and transformed the soldiers' bodies
into their own likenesses.

768
01:20:44,970 --> 01:20:46,904
That's the difference
between them and their victims.

769
01:20:46,972 --> 01:20:51,341
Their victims can't leave their bodies.
Only the original three can do that.

770
01:20:51,410 --> 01:20:54,573
- But I've killed one of them.
- One of which?

771
01:20:54,646 --> 01:20:56,910
One of the two male vampires.

772
01:20:56,982 --> 01:21:01,544
- One of the transformed ones.
- How did you kill him?

773
01:21:01,620 --> 01:21:03,747
The old way, Carlsen.

774
01:21:03,822 --> 01:21:07,918
A leaded metal shaft
penetrating not through the heart...

775
01:21:07,993 --> 01:21:12,089
but through the energy center
two inches below the heart.

776
01:21:12,164 --> 01:21:15,258
Not steel, but leaded iron.

777
01:21:15,334 --> 01:21:17,097
Right, Carlsen?

778
01:21:18,337 --> 01:21:21,773
- Are you there?
- Y es.

779
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:24,900
Carlsen, and you, too, Caine...

780
01:21:24,977 --> 01:21:26,911
it is my belief...

781
01:21:26,979 --> 01:21:31,609
that the vampires of legend
came from creatures such as these.

782
01:21:31,683 --> 01:21:34,914
Perhaps even
from these very creatures.

783
01:21:34,987 --> 01:21:37,547
I know it sounds incredible.

784
01:21:39,458 --> 01:21:41,085
Do you hear me?

785
01:21:41,159 --> 01:21:45,528
It's more than a belief.
It's true.

786
01:21:46,765 --> 01:21:48,426
They visited Earth before.

787
01:21:50,469 --> 01:21:53,802
- What about the other male?
- He's free.

788
01:21:55,140 --> 01:21:57,404
- You have the girl?
- Yes.

789
01:21:57,476 --> 01:22:01,139
- We'll be there soon. Hold on.
- We'll try.

790
01:22:04,383 --> 01:22:06,715
- This came while you were talking.
- What is it?

791
01:22:06,785 --> 01:22:10,585
A scrambled cryptograph to Sir Percy
from the Prime Minister.

792
01:22:10,656 --> 01:22:13,591
We're to proceed directly
to the citadel at Whitehall.

793
01:22:55,300 --> 01:22:56,927
Lieutenant, the controls!

794
01:23:11,049 --> 01:23:13,040
We've lost her.
She's gone!

795
01:23:13,118 --> 01:23:17,077
- Where?
- Her body's in London.

796
01:23:17,155 --> 01:23:19,089
Where in London?

797
01:23:21,827 --> 01:23:25,194
You've got to tell me
what really happened on the Churchill.

798
01:23:27,666 --> 01:23:30,760
It wasn't Rawlings
who destroyed the radio equipment...

799
01:23:30,836 --> 01:23:32,599
and the ship's tapes.

800
01:23:33,672 --> 01:23:35,902
- It was me.
- Why?

801
01:23:35,974 --> 01:23:39,535
I didn't want the Churchill
to be able to reach Earth.

802
01:23:39,611 --> 01:23:42,205
And if it did, I didn't want anyone
to know what happened.

803
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:43,713
What did happen?

804
01:23:44,783 --> 01:23:48,879
I opened her sealed
animation case.

805
01:23:48,954 --> 01:23:53,721
Either I did it
or she did it.

806
01:23:53,792 --> 01:23:56,226
I couldn't help myself.

807
01:23:56,294 --> 01:23:58,387
I've never experienced such--

808
01:24:00,298 --> 01:24:03,563
I was in love on a level
you've never known.

809
01:24:09,307 --> 01:24:12,071
It terrifies me.

810
01:24:12,144 --> 01:24:14,738
My memory plays tricks on me.

811
01:24:18,150 --> 01:24:20,084
She was calling me.

812
01:24:21,153 --> 01:24:24,919
Her power was spiritual.

813
01:24:55,787 --> 01:24:57,721
She wanted me, Caine.

814
01:25:02,294 --> 01:25:03,955
It was more than spiritual.

815
01:25:17,476 --> 01:25:19,876
She took some of my energy.

816
01:25:22,514 --> 01:25:25,244
And she gave me
some of her energy.

817
01:25:32,824 --> 01:25:36,760
They must have been living
off of each other when we found them.

818
01:25:36,828 --> 01:25:39,422
There were only three of them left.

819
01:25:41,099 --> 01:25:45,502
She killed all of my men,
one by one.

820
01:25:47,272 --> 01:25:49,172
But I survived.

821
01:25:50,275 --> 01:25:54,006
She wanted me to survive.
She chose me!

822
01:25:55,614 --> 01:25:57,047
Why?

823
01:25:58,216 --> 01:26:01,379
She's not human.
She's not a woman.

824
01:26:01,453 --> 01:26:03,387
She'll destroy you.

825
01:26:05,290 --> 01:26:07,884
She's destroyed worlds.

826
01:26:07,959 --> 01:26:09,893
There's something
you might want to hear, sir.

827
01:26:09,961 --> 01:26:12,521
A special bulletin
from the BBC.

828
01:26:13,799 --> 01:26:15,733
Tonight London is on the brink...

829
01:26:15,801 --> 01:26:17,894
of the worst devastation
since the blitz.

830
01:26:17,969 --> 01:26:23,236
I can see large areas of the city
burning out of control.

831
01:26:23,308 --> 01:26:25,902
Thousands of people are now rampaging
through the streets...

832
01:26:25,977 --> 01:26:29,913
in a frenzied last effort
to avoid the plague.

833
01:26:29,981 --> 01:26:32,575
Martial law has been enforced now
for three hours...

834
01:26:32,651 --> 01:26:35,211
but it hasn't stemmed
what is obviously--

835
01:27:29,307 --> 01:27:31,707
- Yes, we've been expecting you.
- Thank you. Carry on.

836
01:27:31,776 --> 01:27:34,370
- Hurry over, Sergeant.
- Right, sir.

837
01:27:34,446 --> 01:27:36,744
- Go around the other side.
- Right.

838
01:27:45,557 --> 01:27:47,582
Is everything ready
for the cabinet to evacuate?

839
01:27:47,659 --> 01:27:50,753
- Yes, everything.
- Please take a seat, gentlemen.

840
01:27:54,733 --> 01:28:00,103
Sir, I have Colonel Caine
and Colonel Carlsen here for you.

841
01:28:00,171 --> 01:28:01,798
Very good.

842
01:28:01,873 --> 01:28:05,741
The Prime Minister will see you shortly.
Would you care for tea while you wait?

843
01:28:05,810 --> 01:28:10,076
- Our business is rather urgent.
- The Prime Minister understands that.

844
01:28:11,182 --> 01:28:12,615
- Gentlemen.
- Prime Minister.

845
01:28:12,684 --> 01:28:14,276
I'm Colonel Caine,
Special Air Service...

846
01:28:14,352 --> 01:28:17,116
and I'm sure you've heard
of Colonel Carlsen of the Churchill.

847
01:28:17,188 --> 01:28:18,621
Y es, indeed.

848
01:28:18,690 --> 01:28:21,352
Gentlemen, I look forward
to hearing your report.

849
01:28:21,426 --> 01:28:23,417
By the way,
where is Sir Percy?

850
01:28:23,495 --> 01:28:25,019
Dead, I'm afraid.

851
01:28:25,096 --> 01:28:26,961
Oh, that's a great pity.

852
01:28:27,032 --> 01:28:31,264
Sir, we have information
regarding the object in space...

853
01:28:31,336 --> 01:28:33,964
- which is bearing down on the Earth--
- Yes, gentlemen.

854
01:28:34,039 --> 01:28:36,803
If you'll excuse me
just for a moment.

855
01:28:36,875 --> 01:28:39,400
Miss Haversham,
please come this way.

856
01:28:40,979 --> 01:28:42,571
Here, for a moment.

857
01:28:42,647 --> 01:28:44,581
I'll be back, gentlemen.

858
01:29:00,732 --> 01:29:02,165
Please.

859
01:29:11,676 --> 01:29:13,610
Somebody get the doctor immediately.

860
01:29:18,516 --> 01:29:20,313
We need a doctor over here.

861
01:29:34,466 --> 01:29:36,161
Go!

862
01:30:03,461 --> 01:30:06,692
- Do you have any weapons aboard?
- No, sir!

863
01:30:06,765 --> 01:30:09,063
- There is a flare pistol, sir.
- Where is it?

864
01:30:09,134 --> 01:30:11,295
Close the breach
and it's ready to fire!

865
01:30:11,369 --> 01:30:12,961
Get him!

866
01:30:18,843 --> 01:30:22,438
While you were with the Prime Minister,
I had a call from base operations.

867
01:30:22,514 --> 01:30:25,779
The city is now under martial law.
We've been placed under NATO command.

868
01:30:25,850 --> 01:30:27,283
- NATO?
- Yes, sir.

869
01:30:27,352 --> 01:30:30,617
My unit's been mobilized
to a staging area at Blackheath.

870
01:30:30,688 --> 01:30:33,486
Land at the S.R.C.
We've got to talk to Fallada.

871
01:30:33,558 --> 01:30:37,392
I'm to land at Blackheath.
The city's under air quarantine.

872
01:30:37,462 --> 01:30:39,487
If we don't do as they say,
they'll shoot us down.

873
01:30:45,670 --> 01:30:48,901
Zero, this is X-ray 318 requesting
clearance to land. Over.

874
01:30:48,973 --> 01:30:52,067
Zero, roger.
X-ray 318, you are clear to land.

875
01:31:01,853 --> 01:31:05,414
Come away from the aircraft!
You are under quarantine!

876
01:31:07,325 --> 01:31:08,519
Over here, please, sir.

877
01:31:10,228 --> 01:31:12,423
Don't come any closer!
Stop there!

878
01:31:12,497 --> 01:31:14,658
I want to talk
to your commanding officer.

879
01:31:14,732 --> 01:31:16,757
I am Colonel Caine,
Special Air Service...

880
01:31:16,835 --> 01:31:21,465
and this man is Colonel Tom Carlsen,
United States Air Force...

881
01:31:21,539 --> 01:31:23,234
and former commander
of the Churchill.

882
01:31:27,512 --> 01:31:30,447
Is Dr. Hans Fallada here
from the S.R.C.?

883
01:31:30,515 --> 01:31:34,281
- He knows who we are.
- No, not that I know of.

884
01:31:34,352 --> 01:31:36,513
Has anybody heard of him?

885
01:31:36,588 --> 01:31:38,556
He must still be in London.

886
01:31:38,623 --> 01:31:40,818
Colonel, what exactly do you know
about what's happening there?

887
01:31:40,892 --> 01:31:46,387
All we know for certain is that
a terrible plague is sweeping London.

888
01:31:46,464 --> 01:31:49,297
The incubation period
appears to be two hours.

889
01:31:49,367 --> 01:31:53,861
Until that time has elapsed,
I cannot release you from this compound.

890
01:31:53,938 --> 01:31:57,169
We know what the plague is.
We are not infected.

891
01:31:57,242 --> 01:32:00,575
I know what I'm talking about!
We're wasting valuable time!

892
01:32:01,880 --> 01:32:03,575
We have totally isolated London...

893
01:32:03,648 --> 01:32:06,242
in order to stop further contagion.

894
01:32:06,317 --> 01:32:09,753
If that fails, and the surrounding
areas are threatened...

895
01:32:09,821 --> 01:32:12,016
Yes?

896
01:32:12,090 --> 01:32:15,617
sterilization by thermonuclear device
has been approved.

897
01:32:17,328 --> 01:32:20,195
We have this from General Ames
in Brussels.

898
01:32:20,265 --> 01:32:25,396
He's coming up with that decision
in just under three hours.

899
01:32:25,470 --> 01:32:28,098
Have you heard anything
about the ship?

900
01:32:28,173 --> 01:32:31,074
- "The ship"?
- The thing from Halley's Comet.

901
01:32:34,012 --> 01:32:37,641
It's parked itself in a geostationary
orbit directly over London.

902
01:32:56,668 --> 01:33:02,573
All those little blue lights going up
toward the clouds are human souls.

903
01:33:03,808 --> 01:33:06,936
- How do you know that?
- I feel it.

904
01:33:07,011 --> 01:33:11,710
The process of conversion releases
a life energy that can be collected.

905
01:33:11,783 --> 01:33:13,250
"Collected"?

906
01:33:14,485 --> 01:33:18,478
Is that what the umbrella is?
A collector?

907
01:33:18,556 --> 01:33:22,390
The energy doesn't go free.
It goes up there.

908
01:33:43,615 --> 01:33:46,675
The male vampire is collecting
life energy...

909
01:33:46,751 --> 01:33:51,211
but he has to send it through her
to get it up to the collector.

910
01:33:52,957 --> 01:33:54,891
Where is she?

911
01:33:56,561 --> 01:33:57,994
Over there.

912
01:33:59,464 --> 01:34:02,228
I get flashes
coming from her body.

913
01:34:02,300 --> 01:34:06,566
It's sensitive to its environment.
It picks up things.

914
01:34:06,638 --> 01:34:10,074
- Can you find her?
- If I can get across to the city.

915
01:34:11,309 --> 01:34:12,742
What about the male?

916
01:34:12,810 --> 01:34:15,574
He'll come if he senses I found her.

917
01:34:15,647 --> 01:34:18,741
She's drawing me.

918
01:34:18,816 --> 01:34:20,579
I've got to go.

919
01:34:22,086 --> 01:34:23,576
Why?

920
01:34:23,655 --> 01:34:26,590
She wants back
the energy she gave me.

921
01:34:29,661 --> 01:34:32,687
When they take on a new life-form...

922
01:34:32,764 --> 01:34:35,927
they have to learn
from that life-form.

923
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:37,865
Mate with it, in a sense.

924
01:34:40,271 --> 01:34:42,205
The girl chose me.

925
01:34:44,108 --> 01:34:47,703
But when she mixed with me,
she gave me a part of herself.

926
01:34:50,448 --> 01:34:52,541
Now she wants that part back.

927
01:34:53,851 --> 01:34:56,718
Is there any sign of activity
in your sector? Over.

928
01:34:56,788 --> 01:35:00,383
- No, sir.
- Okay, keep me posted. Over.

929
01:35:00,458 --> 01:35:03,894
Colonel, listen to me. Carlsen
believes he can locate the source.

930
01:35:03,961 --> 01:35:05,724
There are only two carriers.

931
01:35:05,797 --> 01:35:09,392
If we can destroy them, it may not
be necessary to destroy London.

932
01:35:09,467 --> 01:35:12,061
But we only have
an hour and a half.

933
01:35:13,304 --> 01:35:14,896
Cease firing!

934
01:35:16,307 --> 01:35:19,401
Where's Carlsen?

935
01:35:19,477 --> 01:35:21,741
He knocked over two of my men
and took an armored land rover.

936
01:35:21,813 --> 01:35:23,747
Did he say where he was going?

937
01:35:23,815 --> 01:35:26,909
He wanted to know where
the Space Research Center was.

938
01:35:26,984 --> 01:35:28,918
Rogers told him,
then I was on the ground.

939
01:35:28,986 --> 01:35:31,079
- Right. Whose car is this?
- That?

940
01:35:31,155 --> 01:35:33,180
- That's the colonel's.
- Give me the keys.

941
01:35:33,257 --> 01:35:36,988
- What?
- I'm commandeering the car!

942
01:35:37,061 --> 01:35:38,494
Give it to him.

943
01:35:39,997 --> 01:35:41,294
And your side arm.

944
01:35:44,936 --> 01:35:47,370
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

945
01:35:48,639 --> 01:35:51,164
Once you're inside there,
we can't allow you out.

946
01:35:54,979 --> 01:35:56,674
- Watch out!
- He's going in!

947
01:36:01,285 --> 01:36:03,378
Colonel Caine, S.A.S.
I'm crossing the river.

948
01:36:03,454 --> 01:36:05,888
- You don't want to go in there.
- I know I don't.

949
01:36:07,959 --> 01:36:11,395
Get them gates in position!
Secure this post! Move!

950
01:40:12,503 --> 01:40:14,437
I'm glad to see you alive.

951
01:40:15,506 --> 01:40:18,236
I reciprocate the sentiment.

952
01:40:18,309 --> 01:40:22,143
- Is he really dead this time?
- The only way they can be killed.

953
01:40:31,489 --> 01:40:34,117
- Where's Bukovsky?
- Dead.

954
01:40:35,359 --> 01:40:38,726
- How?
- Like the rest.

955
01:40:40,831 --> 01:40:43,061
How did you survive?

956
01:40:46,971 --> 01:40:51,237
- You're looking for Carlsen.
- Has he been here?

957
01:40:51,308 --> 01:40:53,902
No. Perhaps he misled you.

958
01:40:53,978 --> 01:40:57,277
- What do you know about it?
- I've been doing some more work.

959
01:40:57,348 --> 01:41:01,409
- Go on.
- I've discovered...

960
01:41:01,485 --> 01:41:04,682
there is life after death.

961
01:41:04,755 --> 01:41:09,920
-How do you know?
-There is a certain mental transference.

962
01:41:09,994 --> 01:41:14,158
Telepathy occurs between
the vampires and their victims.

963
01:41:16,834 --> 01:41:21,134
- Carlsen is after the girl.
- How did you know that?

964
01:41:24,341 --> 01:41:27,777
- I seem to sense it.
- Where is she?

965
01:41:30,681 --> 01:41:32,615
Don't you know?

966
01:41:35,519 --> 01:41:38,454
- Carlsen knows.
- Where?

967
01:41:38,522 --> 01:41:42,219
She's in the cathedral.

968
01:41:42,293 --> 01:41:45,228
She's been there
since she escaped.

969
01:41:45,296 --> 01:41:48,231
Rather a nice touch,
don't you think?

970
01:41:48,299 --> 01:41:51,393
The crypt of kings and queens.

971
01:41:51,469 --> 01:41:53,061
Stay where you are.

972
01:42:13,157 --> 01:42:14,749
Here I go.

973
01:43:32,303 --> 01:43:34,294
I knew you would come.

974
01:44:18,616 --> 01:44:20,049
I'm here.

975
01:44:20,117 --> 01:44:23,177
Now can this madness end?

976
01:44:24,154 --> 01:44:26,088
Come.

977
01:44:26,156 --> 01:44:27,851
Be with me.

978
01:44:29,159 --> 01:44:31,059
I need you.

979
01:44:31,128 --> 01:44:33,596
It was always intended...

980
01:44:33,664 --> 01:44:35,325
you should find us...

981
01:44:35,399 --> 01:44:37,959
and bring us to Earth.

982
01:44:44,808 --> 01:44:49,040
The web of destiny
carries your blood and soul...

983
01:44:49,113 --> 01:44:52,640
back to the genesis
of my life-form.

984
01:44:58,956 --> 01:45:00,583
Come with me.

985
01:48:12,549 --> 01:48:16,280
It will be much less terrifying
if you just come to me.

986
01:48:21,758 --> 01:48:23,385
I'll do just that.

987
01:49:51,148 --> 01:49:52,581
What are these feelings?

988
01:49:52,649 --> 01:49:56,585
Why do I feel so close to you,
need you?

989
01:49:56,653 --> 01:50:01,113
Because you're one of us.
You always have been.

990
01:50:01,191 --> 01:50:03,159
You're like me.
Be with me.

991
01:50:16,006 --> 01:50:18,941
Just a little more.

992
01:50:19,941 --> 01:50:29,941
