00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,312
Jesus!

2
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,757
Asshole!

3
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,872
Did you see that?
He pulled right out in front of me!

4
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,872
I took my eyes off the road
for a second, but come on!

5
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,878
Maybe it's time we take a break.

6
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,478
I'll pull over the next chance we get.

7
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,711
Nice car.

8
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,518
Thanks.

9
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,670
You got your air, CD...

10
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,919
...leather.

11
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,713
You sprung for the whole nine yards.

12
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:48,876
I guess so. But I suppose that rig of
yours is what you really need out here.

13
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,911
Why would you want that piece of shit
when you got a ride like this?

14
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:04,836
- What you need out here is a CB radio.
- Yeah, is that right?

15
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,353
If you use a CB, you need a handle.

16
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,637
Yours could be "Shit-for-Brains."

17
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,872
Do you even care
that you damn near killed us?

18
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,715
I didn't see you.
You pulled out in front of me.

19
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,874
- Like hell I did! I saw what happened!
- Let's just forget this, okay?

20
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,879
I'm sorry it ever happened.
I don't want any trouble.

21
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,278
No, I bet you don't.

22
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,953
Howdy, ma'am. Ought to be
more careful who you ride with.

23
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,915
- What was that all about?
- Nothing. The guy in the truck.

24
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,920
He thinks I tried to hit him.

25
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,833
Come on, let's go.

26
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,668
- Do you want me to drive?
- Later. Just get in.

27
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,832
- I promise not to sideswipe anyone.
- Just get in.

28
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,876
I'm kidding.

29
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,638
You getting ready
for the Grand Prix?

30
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,916
What did you get?

31
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,716
Junk food fiesta. Let's see...

32
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,633
Sno Balls...

33
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,952
...Yoo-hoo and MoonPies.

34
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,908
- Can you believe they still make this?
- It's gourmet cuisine around here.

35
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,110
This is crazy. Look at this.

36
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,673
It says, "If you win
this mail-in contest...

37
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:12,508
...you can choose between $90,000
or 90,000 donuts."

38
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,635
What would you do
with 90,000 donuts?

39
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,953
I don't know. Sell them for
30 cents each and pay off this car.

40
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,510
No kidding.

41
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,713
Ninety thousand dollars.

42
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,996
That'd solve some problems.

43
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,833
What the hell?

44
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,633
- What did you do?
- Nothing. I...

45
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,877
Hang on. I can't steer.

46
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,071
Unbelievable.

47
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,151
- Perfect.
- Out of range?

48
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,158
So much for taking the scenic route.

49
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,990
- The baffle gasket's burned out.
- What?

50
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:53,910
- It's connected to the connecting rod.
- Oh, God, shut up!

51
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,758
Oh, man! Can you believe this?

52
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:01,839
- This could be our worst decision ever.
- What are you doing?

53
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:05,953
No, just listen.
We're changing jobs, right?

54
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,715
Our finances are pretty well fucked.

55
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:14,795
And we're in the middle of nowhere.
Yeah, this is our worst decision.

56
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,872
Get out of here! You're bugging me.

57
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,629
Okay, good luck,
because I'm going to California.

58
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,713
No problem.
Just leave me the MoonPies.

59
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,670
- And the donuts!
- No, there's a car.

60
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,871
Christ, not these guys.

61
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,870
Assholes.

62
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,151
Jeff?

63
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,837
What the hell's..?

64
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,236
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.

65
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,996
This isn't good.

66
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,878
- Hi. You folks all right?
- Fine. Our car broke down.

67
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:01,111
I saw that.
I'll help you push it off the road.

68
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,995
Thanks for the help.
Honey, you want to steer?

69
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,029
Massachusetts plates.
You folks on vacation?

70
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,992
No, we're moving.

71
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,870
- Oh, yeah? Whereabouts?
- San Diego.

72
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:24,397
Do you think we can use your CB
to radio a tow truck?

73
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,715
I blew a fuse on it this morning.
I'll fix it at the truck stop at l-40.

74
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,236
- How far is that?
- About 60 miles.

75
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,951
I was just driving along
and she quit on me.

76
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,953
Belts, battery's working.

77
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,876
It used to be, you'd kick it and it
would start. Now they got computers.

78
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,077
- It is a new car.
- You know, that could be it.

79
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,757
You been riding it pretty hard?
They tend to overheat when they're new.

80
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,877
Well, yeah, a little, but not...

81
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:03,878
Tell you what. I can give you a ride
to Belle's, a diner five miles down.

82
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,868
They've got a pay phone.
You can call a tow truck.

83
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,838
That's nice of you,
but I think you got it.

84
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,550
We'll just let her cool off a bit.
Thanks. We really appreciate it.

85
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,839
- I wish you luck getting it started.
- Thanks a lot.

86
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:24,879
- Honey.
- He's right. It's just overheated.

87
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,878
What if it's not?
We'd be stuck out here.

88
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,552
No, but just give it some time,
let it cool off. We'll be all right.

89
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:39,197
It's getting pretty toasty out here.
Are you sure you wanna blow this ride?

90
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,795
No, but...

91
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,269
I don't want to leave the car alone.

92
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:50,594
What if I take the ride, call the tow
truck and order a nice, cold iced tea?

93
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,917
- And I stay with a nice, hot car?
- Right.

94
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,276
Right.

95
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,868
- Sure you're all right?
- I'll be fine.

96
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,478
Excuse me.

97
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,189
- Can I take you up on that ride?
- Sure, step on up.

98
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:18,557
- Your husband doesn't want to come?
- No, he's gonna stay with the car.

99
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,989
What the hell?

100
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,398
Tow truck, my ass.

101
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:29,394
Excuse me. I was supposed
to meet my wife here.

102
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:36,475
She's dark-haired, about 5'5",
wearing a white Benetton sweater.

103
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,796
- White what?
- Benetton sweater.

104
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:44,111
Hank, your order's up! I'm pretty
busy here. People come and go.

105
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:49,229
This was within the last half-hour.
She may have been with a trucker.

106
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,116
A guy wearing a baseball cap,
driving a big 18-wheeler.

107
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,992
Doesn't ring a bell.

108
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,350
You sure?

109
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,518
This man's looking for his wife.
Dark hair, white button-on sweater...

110
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,272
...traveling with a guy wearing a cap.
Has anybody seen them?

111
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,039
Looks like she got away
from you, cowboy.

112
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:23,031
You think maybe she left a message
with one of your other employees?

113
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:27,558
Don't see how that's possible.
I'm the only one that works here.

114
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:35,233
- Is there another Belle's Diner?
- No sirree! Definitely not.

115
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:19,636
She and I must have gotten our signals
crossed. How far is the next town?

116
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,789
About 20 miles.

117
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,236
Can you do me a favor?
If my wife, Amy, comes in...

118
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,234
...tell her I was here
and to stay put till I get back.

119
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,233
- Could you do that, please?
- Yeah, okay.

120
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,598
Thanks.

121
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,871
Pull over!

122
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,474
Pull over!

123
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,591
I don't believe it.

124
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,111
Jesus!

125
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,677
Christ!

126
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,471
Hey, man.

127
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,555
- What are you doing?
- Trying to stop you. Didn't you see me?

128
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,756
- Yeah.
- Well?

129
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:42,159
Never mind. I'm looking for my wife.
Where is she?

130
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,675
How should I know where your wife is?

131
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,192
I'm the guy with the Jeep.
You gave her a ride to Belle's Diner.

132
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,674
Not me. Sorry.

133
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,873
Sorry? This was like a half-hour ago.
You don't remember?

134
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:59,677
Look, I've never seen you before
in my life.

135
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,669
What are you doing?

136
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,753
Amy?

137
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,869
Amy, are you in there?

138
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,189
Look, I don't know what you want...

139
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,677
I want my wife back!
Now what have you done..?

140
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:30,879
- Officer, I need your help.
- What's the problem?

141
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:35,871
- He's done something with my wife.
- Calm down, sir. What's going on?

142
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:40,590
I don't know. Last I saw her,
she was with this guy, in his truck.

143
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:45,237
- Now he says he never saw her!
- I don't know what he's talking about.

144
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,869
- Don't lie, you son of a bitch!
- Calm down!

145
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,199
- Now tell me exactly what happened.
- Okay, all right.

146
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:56,479
Our car broke down.
He stopped, offered to help...

147
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,349
...and took my wife to a pay phone.
But she never showed up!

148
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,679
- What do you have to say about this?
- Officer, I don't know.

149
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,317
He runs me off the road
and starts hollering about his wife.

150
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,438
I swear, I've never seen him before.

151
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,591
- You didn't give his wife a ride?
- No.

152
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,717
He's lying!

153
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,949
- Sir, may I search your truck?
- Hell yes. Go ahead.

154
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,871
My name's Red Barr. All my permits
are current. You can see them.

155
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,879
That's not necessary. Stand back
behind the line, both of you.

156
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:12,869
I need to see your license
and registration, please.

157
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,874
- Are those yours?
- Yeah.

158
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,911
My personal stuff.
You want to take a look?

159
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,672
No.

160
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:50,435
I think we're done here.
You're free to go.

161
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,917
Wait, that's it?
You won't question him anymore?

162
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:58,911
I've searched the truck. There's
no evidence of suspicious activity.

163
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,920
Maybe you confused my truck
with another.

164
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,710
- Go to hell! Let me see that!
- Hold on a second!

165
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,839
You want to get arrested?
The man's got a point here.

166
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:13,913
This is a plain-looking truck.
Looks like a lot of trucks.

167
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,113
Maybe you did get them mixed up.

168
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,716
You stay put.

169
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,871
Mr. Taylor?

170
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,711
Come on.

171
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,159
It was him. It was this truck.

172
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,876
I can see that.
Did you get a license plate number?

173
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,911
What? No!

174
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:58,759
- How about the information on the door?
- I wasn't paying attention. Come on!

175
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,793
Mr. Taylor, did you have a beef
with your wife today?

176
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,194
What's that got to do with anything?

177
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,553
Is there a possibility
she could have left you?

178
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:17,197
I don't believe this.
My wife did not leave me!

179
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:21,798
You put two people in a car
long enough, they'll go at it.

180
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:26,590
I've seen men dump their women
on the roadside and vice versa.

181
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:32,153
Officer, I'd really like to stay and
help, but I got a long haul to Fresno.

182
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,512
Go ahead.
I appreciate your cooperation.

183
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,115
This is insane. Officer, please.

184
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:43,554
I've got his information. If I need to
find him later, I know where to look.

185
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,718
Sir.

186
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,033
Much obliged.

187
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:58,592
No hard feelings. I really do hope
you find your wife. Thanks.

188
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,878
Mr. Taylor, you want to come with me?

189
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,110
I believe you that she's missing.

190
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:41,872
Maybe you got confused about
which truck. I'm trying to help.

191
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:47,151
The town of Brackett is 31 miles away.
My deputy's name is Len Carver.

192
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:51,269
He'll help you if you want
to report your wife missing.

193
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:57,752
<i>Sheriff, Mrs. Gilbert's locked out</i>
<i>of her trailer. Can you help her?</i>

194
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,872
- 10-4. Tell her I'm on my way.
<i>- Will do.</i>

195
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:04,077
Mr. Taylor, do yourself a favor...

196
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,951
...go see my deputy.

197
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,239
- Is this a recent picture?
- Yes, a couple months old.

198
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,959
Her hair's the same?

199
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,875
Yeah.

200
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:48,159
Well, we'll certainly
do our best, Mr. Taylor.

201
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,234
Over 100,000 people go missing
in this country every year.

202
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:57,879
Runaways, deadbeat dads, dropouts,
folks hiding from the IRS...

203
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:04,759
...all vanishing without a trace. We get
these kinds of pictures all the time.

204
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,793
I'm not saying your wife
is one of them. I hope not.

205
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,078
Unless there's a ransom demand
or evidence of forced abduction...

206
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:17,438
...the FBI won't even look at
your case until it's been 24 hours.

207
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:21,948
Nevertheless, we'll certainly
keep our eyes peeled.

208
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,871
Mr. Taylor...

209
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:36,950
...why don't you go to Belle's? Get
a cup of coffee, wait for your wife.

210
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:41,438
If anything comes up,
I'll contact you. How's that sound?

211
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,159
Yeah.

212
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:11,154
- Did my wife come in?
- Didn't see her.

213
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,073
You didn't see her
or she didn't come in?

214
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:18,029
Like I said last time,
maybe she was in, maybe she wasn't.

215
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:21,431
All I'm saying is
that I didn't see her.

216
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:35,194
It ain't none of my business, but if
I was you, I'd check the ladies' room.

217
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,839
Amy?

218
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,153
Amy!

219
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,872
I'll be right with you, cowboy.

220
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:42,157
- I want to see your order slips.
- What?

221
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,845
You write down the names.
Let me see.

222
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,953
Are you nuts?
I don't have to show you jackshit!

223
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:54,035
If my wife came in here,
then her name's in that pile.

224
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,994
You calling me a liar?

225
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,597
Let me see these fucking slips!

226
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,629
Mister, I've had
just about enough of you.

227
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,871
<i>- Operator.</i>
- Sheriff's office.

228
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,311
<i>- One moment, please.</i>
- Come on!

229
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,994
My name's Billy.

230
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:50,391
You the fella looking for his wife?

231
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,554
Yes!

232
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,358
Yeah, how'd you know?
Did you see her?

233
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:00,878
Have you seen her? Please,
if you know something, tell me.

234
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,509
- I seen her, maybe.
- Where? When?

235
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:08,232
Inside, a little while ago.

236
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,954
- She came in on a truck.
- Right.

237
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,913
- A big semi.
- Then what?

238
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:20,070
Well, then she left on another truck.

239
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,111
With who?

240
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:27,676
With some men.
They think I'm a dummy, but I ain't.

241
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,996
I'll get my trucker's license.

242
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:35,189
This is very important.
Did you see where they took my wife?

243
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:42,749
- Route 7, north. Up by the river.
- By the river? Where?

244
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:50,074
They don't tell me that kind of thing.

245
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:54,558
Who doesn't? The bartender?
The men in the truck?

246
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,876
I ain't talking to you no more.

247
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:02,996
Come with me to the police. If you tell
them what you saw, they can help me.

248
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:06,914
- Well, now you the dummy.
- What's that supposed to mean?

249
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:12,399
Don't you get it?
Police is the ones in on it.

250
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,557
Work, goddamn it.

251
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:41,712
Hello! Steve, this is Jeffrey Taylor,
you remember? Right.

252
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,589
Don't put me on hold, please!
Listen, I need a favor.

253
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:49,190
I gotta talk to that friend of yours
at the FBI.

254
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:53,393
Right. It's about Amy.
Something's happened to...

255
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:56,916
I think she's been...
She's missing! I think she's...

256
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,236
Hello? Fuck!

257
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,639
Hello! Steve? Yeah.
No, don't call me back!

258
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:10,431
Steve! Steve! Shit!

259
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,837
What..?

260
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,031
- Get out of the car now!
- Oh, shit!

261
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,349
Son of a bitch!

262
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,876
Son of a bitch!

263
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,475
What do you want?!

264
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,316
He's getting away!

265
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:25,714
- What the hell's going on?
- He got away, went down the river.

266
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:04,955
Yeah, we're pulling it out now.

267
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:09,473
- Careful. It's gonna come loose.
- I got it.

268
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,871
This is what happens
when you get one without the other.

269
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:18,552
- How do we explain this to Warren?
- I ain't gonna.

270
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,872
Hey, you all right?

271
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:42,829
According to your wife, you got a pile
of cash in your bank account.

272
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,871
Is that true?

273
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,875
- There's some, yeah.
- Well, "some" just don't cut it.

274
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:54,956
She gave us an exact dollar amount.
I want that same figure from you.

275
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:59,759
There are different accounts.
The balance fluctuates. I don't...

276
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,313
Fluctuates, my ass.

277
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:05,035
If some hotshot like you ain't
watching his bottom line...

278
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,398
...it'd be the first time in history.

279
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,631
What do you think, Earl?

280
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:15,879
I think we've been lied to.
He ain't no goddamn donut king.

281
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:20,551
The slut lied to save her ass.
Piece of shit. I'm gonna do him.

282
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,478
Ninety thousand.

283
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,756
Ninety thousand dollars.

284
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,593
Now you crawl your ass out of there.

285
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:56,790
You're a tough man
to get ahold of, Jeffrey.

286
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,916
What do you want?

287
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,994
It's not what I want,
it's what you want.

288
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,437
How bad do you want it?
It is gonna cost you.

289
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,153
I can't show it to you now...

290
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:12,839
...but it's about 5'5", 115 pounds,
three or four of that just pure tit.

291
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:16,873
Nice, curly, brown hair
upstairs and down.

292
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,871
Interested?

293
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,513
Why?

294
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,878
What does this..? Why us?

295
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,875
Bring him up here.

296
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,189
The town of Brackett, Jeff.

297
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,672
It's a two-bit shithole
in the middle of nowhere.

298
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,873
See the bank down there?

299
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,873
You're gonna tell the manager
to express-wire...

300
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:54,870
...$90,000 from your bank account
in Boston. Cash.

301
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,155
How do I know she's still alive?

302
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,790
Shut up!

303
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,999
Come on, Jeff.

304
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,873
I need you to pay attention.

305
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,873
You see that building with
the flagpole coming out the top?

306
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,878
- Yeah.
- That's the sheriff's station.

307
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:24,954
There are two cops. One has desk duty,
the other is patrolling the foothills.

308
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,872
A minute ago, Billy here...

309
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,919
...called in an accident
on the l-40 connector.

310
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:34,550
See? There he goes.

311
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,479
It will take him 20 minutes
to get there...

312
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:42,878
...10 to see there's no accident,
and 20 to get back. That's 50 minutes.

313
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:47,072
That is exactly the amount of time
you have to get my money.

314
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,873
Before you get any ideas
about calling in the cavalry...

315
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,758
...remember, we'll be watching you.

316
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:00,917
We're gonna be listening
on those scanners.

317
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:03,236
And if we see anything unusual...

318
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:08,754
...an unmarked car, a plane, one human
being who even smells like a cop...

319
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,872
...you can just keep
your fucking money, Jeff...

320
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:15,071
...and I'll send you pieces of her
from time to time.

321
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,639
Billy.

322
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,555
Give him the jacket.

323
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,912
Go on. Put it on, Jeff.

324
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:30,908
You can't go into a bank looking
like that, now, can you?

325
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:36,870
We don't have to do this, because
I can get you the money, I swear.

326
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,316
I promise you.
Just let my wife go, please.

327
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:45,749
Forty-nine minutes, Jeff.
Time to get the show on the road.

328
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:40,639
Here's my driver's license
and credit card, if you need it.

329
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:44,958
The account number from my bank
in Boston. How long will this take?

330
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:47,196
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

331
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,868
I only have $5000 in that account.

332
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:53,037
How much can you advance me
on my credit card?

333
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:56,755
My card has a $6000 limit,
can you advance me that?

334
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:02,876
No, I'm sorry, I can't. The limit
for non-customers is $500 a day.

335
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:08,429
Sir, are you sure you're all right?

336
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,717
Yeah, I'm fine.

337
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,231
Just transfer the money, okay?

338
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:36,838
I'm gonna tell you something.

339
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:41,079
What I'm about to tell you...

340
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:45,949
You can't call anyone,
do you understand?

341
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,879
Yes.

342
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:53,790
Whatever happens,
just keep writing on that pad.

343
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:56,872
Please, now, just keep writing.

344
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:02,869
They're probably watching now.
They have police scanners.

345
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:06,271
The whole town's under surveillance.

346
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:12,876
If I don't walk out of here with...

347
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,434
Excuse me. You the manager?

348
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:18,991
- Yes, I am.
- I was told to see you about a loan.

349
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:21,279
Certainly.

350
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:24,790
If you would just take a seat.

351
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:38,237
Yes?

352
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:52,476
Just forget it.
I had a car accident, a minor one.

353
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,871
I'm just kind of...

354
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,508
How long is this gonna take?

355
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:02,954
It will... Well, it's going
to take a few minutes.

356
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:14,872
Yeah, I'm calling
regarding account number...

357
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:19,830
...9- 8-2-5-8-1-0-3.

358
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,509
Jeffrey Taylor.

359
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,878
Shit.

360
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:55,953
It's me.

361
00:48:56,160 --> 00:49:00,039
<i>No shit. I can see that.</i>
<i>How much you got?</i>

362
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,988
The whole thing. Ninety thousand.

363
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:07,553
<i>That's good.</i>

364
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:13,232
<i>Start walking toward the main road</i>
<i>and get in the first car that stops.</i>

365
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:15,551
When do I see my wife?

366
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:19,389
<i>Soon enough, Jeff.</i>
<i>Just start walking.</i>

367
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:31,072
Just throw the money
right up here on the seat.

368
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:34,158
No. First you tell me where she is.

369
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:37,955
Wrong, asshole.
First you give me the money...

370
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:43,195
...unless you want me to shoot your
ass dead right here on the highway.

371
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,151
Turn around.

372
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,630
Do it!

373
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:14,038
Put your hands behind you.

374
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,800
Step toward the truck.

375
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:31,589
Get up in the truck. On your knees.
Get in here, goddamn it!

376
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:52,236
I gave you the money, now let her go.

377
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:55,713
What the hell..?

378
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:07,638
Yeah, it's a done deal.

379
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:12,195
I'm heading in. Yeah, I got you.

380
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:22,428
You gotta be the dumbest
motherfucker yet.

381
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:25,393
Think we picked you
out of the clear blue?

382
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:29,673
Shiny, new car.
Massachusetts plates.

383
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:32,519
It'll probably be a week
before anybody misses you.

384
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:36,634
You should have a bumper
sticker that goes with that car:

385
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:40,515
"Rich Assholes Looking for Trouble."

386
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:59,431
I wish I had been there to see
your face when your car seized up.

387
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:04,829
Maybe you'll learn not to leave your
hood open when you go in the store.

388
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:23,196
What the hell is that?

389
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:30,671
These ain't nothing but goddamn
singles! You lying son of a...

390
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:15,949
Shit!

391
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:30,393
Hey! What are you doing in there?

392
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:38,757
Where is she?

393
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:41,872
- Fuck you.
- No, fuck you!

394
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,870
You like that? How about this?

395
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:49,749
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

396
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:52,713
The fuck you don't know!

397
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:56,874
Stop. Stop.

398
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:00,433
What's that?
You really want me to stop?

399
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:03,996
Because I'll bet this baby stops
on a fucking dime!

400
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:18,759
What the hell?

401
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:28,431
- Where is she?!
- With Billy.

402
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:29,993
- Where?
- Driving around.

403
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,549
Bullshit!

404
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:37,795
I'm in pursuit of a black Ford pickup
truck. Contact the state police.

405
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:41,376
We're headed northbound, Highway 31.
I need backup.

406
00:55:41,411 --> 00:55:44,872
- Where were you taking the money?
- The truck stop.

407
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:49,789
- Where exactly?
- On the main highway. The Texaco.

408
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:54,317
Son of a bitch!

409
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:56,996
Help me. My wife's been kidnapped.

410
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:58,913
- Drop the gun!
- You got it.

411
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:01,595
- Get down!
- I know where she is.

412
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:03,597
Get on the ground! Do it!

413
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:07,548
I'm down. Listen to me. He's in on it.

414
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:10,877
They kidnapped my wife.
There's four of them.

415
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:15,113
- They have her at a Texaco truck stop.
- Shut up!

416
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:19,953
- You in the pickup, you all right?
- You have to believe me.

417
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:22,590
- Yes, I'm okay.
- Can you get out?

418
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,711
Yes. Please don't shoot me.

419
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,030
There's a bag with money in there!

420
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,829
Face down, spread eagle and shut up!

421
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:33,038
Get out, damn it!

422
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:35,118
Goddamn it, listen to me!

423
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:36,873
Shut the fuck up!

424
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:50,155
Hey, shit-for-brains.

425
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:13,036
Shots fired.

426
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:16,590
Officer down.

427
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:23,189
Suspect identified.

428
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:30,192
<i>This is state police dispatch.</i>
<i>What is your 20?</i>

429
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:34,880
- Get an ambulance. He's been shot.
<i>- Who is this?</i>

430
00:57:34,915 --> 00:57:38,156
<i>- Sheriff, can you respond?</i>
- They're coming.

431
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:45,429
<i>Sheriff, hang on.</i>
<i>We're getting you an ambulance.</i>

432
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:51,630
<i>All units. Officer down.</i>
<i>Repeat, officer down.</i>

433
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:10,874
I don't know. He was supposed
to be here half an hour ago.

434
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:14,555
I heard a report about a cop down.

435
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:18,639
I'm leaving. There's too much heat
around here. Stay off the airwaves.

436
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:20,876
Get his wife. Meet me at the barn.

437
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:24,112
I don't care if we have
to drive all night.

438
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:17,429
- Daddy, you're home!
- Hey, Deke! Miss me?

439
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:21,350
Deke, get back to bed.
I expected you back next week.

440
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:26,395
I finished early and now I'm home.
Al and Billy are coming over.

441
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:29,154
It's 6 a.m.
Can't they come another time?

442
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:32,392
We got stuff to do.
It'll take a few hours.

443
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:35,273
Go in and make breakfast.
Hey, Deke!

444
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:39,869
- Wanna open the barn for your dad?
- Okay.

445
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:11,874
Hey, Dekey. Thanks.

446
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:15,675
Hey, I got something for you.
Ready?

447
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:18,440
Here you go, son. Look at that.

448
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:20,870
- Cool!
- Cool.

449
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:23,435
A real Swiss Army knife.

450
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:25,631
Good boy.

451
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:07,598
Deke?

452
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:10,151
Deke, you back there?

453
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:04,832
If I never see another couple
from Massachusetts, it'll be too soon.

454
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:07,952
We've got a lot of work to do.
Any word on Earl?

455
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:09,832
- Not a thing.
- Me neither.

456
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:12,838
We gotta get this stuff off the truck.

457
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:16,999
Anything that can trace us back
to that fuck, we get rid of.

458
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:19,839
Anything, Billy. You got that?

459
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:29,593
You should have gotten that jerk
at the same time as his wife.

460
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,791
He wouldn't get in the truck.

461
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,276
I suppose you'd just chase him
with a gun. Idiot.

462
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:39,712
You should have gotten rid of them
like that couple in Ohio.

463
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:44,635
So we stay out of the area
for a couple months. Big deal.

464
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:48,395
Al! Come on.

465
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:56,791
All right, honey. Time to get up.

466
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,594
- Let's go!
- Come on, move it!

467
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:02,470
Get up!

468
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:04,798
Dead?

469
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:09,309
Must have died from
the exhaust, huh? Suicide!

470
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:12,632
Couldn't be any cleaner than that,
could you?

471
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:18,039
Get that plastic, we'll bury her
out back before sunup. Let's go.

472
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:28,192
Jesus! Goddamn!

473
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:31,473
Scared me half to death!

474
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:34,069
Let me do her. I'll cut her head off.

475
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:37,192
- Warren, you in there?
- Shit, it's my wife.

476
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:40,517
- Cover her. Put her in the freezer.
- Warren?

477
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:42,591
Be right there, Arleen.

478
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:02,239
She's a feisty one, isn't she?

479
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:07,628
That's right, lady.
You just keep it up.

480
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:19,275
Don't give me any trouble. Goddamn it!
Cut your fucking squirming!

481
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:22,278
Come on, baby,
it's not as bad as it sounds.

482
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:27,270
It'll take you 10 minutes to suck all
that air out. You won't even feel it.

483
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:37,434
Come on, fellas, come on.

484
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:41,878
Let's go eat!

485
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:54,634
Hey, Mrs. C.

486
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:58,116
Are you coming to breakfast?
I've been calling you.

487
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:01,357
We sure could use
some of them pancakes.

488
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:34,314
Hey, Billy! Come in the house!

489
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:27,311
It must have weighed 10 pounds.

490
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:31,069
It starts reaching out
to the highway patrol cop.

491
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:34,952
Reaches way out for the...

492
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:39,033
Give me the key.

493
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:43,632
- Mister...
- Don't "mister" me, you son of a bitch!

494
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:46,877
My wife is locked in a hole
in your fucking barn!

495
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:50,629
Give me the key,
or I'll blow your fucking head off!

496
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:53,758
- What's going on?
- I don't know. Stay calm.

497
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:58,112
Your husband's a murderer and
a kidnapper. Give me the fucking key!

498
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:00,715
Freeze, mister.

499
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:09,350
You don't wanna do that, kid.
Put the gun down.

500
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:14,953
Don't listen to him, Deke.
You just keep that gun right on him.

501
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:17,635
Dad keeps his rifle
loaded all the time...

502
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:20,752
...in case I need to protect Mommy
when he's away.

503
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:24,873
- I understand. I won't hurt your mom.
- He's lying, Deke.

504
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:27,713
Now go on, son.

505
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:29,871
Squeeze that trigger. Go on.

506
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:32,556
- Don't listen to him.
- Go on.

507
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:37,629
- Don't listen to him. He's wrong.
- Do what I say. Squeeze the trigger.

508
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:41,879
Put it down, Deke.
Nothing's gonna happen.

509
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:43,758
Do it!

510
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:46,711
Goddamn!

511
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:49,996
Don't move!

512
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:53,871
Nobody move!

513
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:57,950
Get out here, kid!
Get over by your mom.

514
01:13:58,160 --> 01:13:59,957
It's all right.

515
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:03,636
Get over there! Get over there!

516
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:05,999
Shit!

517
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:09,871
All right.

518
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:13,189
Stick together
and get out that door.

519
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:15,835
Move it! Get out of here!
Move it!

520
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:18,872
Turn around. Turn around!

521
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:25,912
Open it.

522
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:40,872
Get down there
and open that freezer up.

523
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:47,552
- Warren, what is this?
- Just pull the chain, Arleen.

524
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:54,158
Open it!

525
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:02,879
You better pray she's alive.

526
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:15,950
You made it, baby. Come on.

527
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:18,799
Get away from me!

528
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:22,879
Come on, honey. Come on up.
Come on, honey.

529
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:25,712
It's all right.

530
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:32,595
You son of a bitch, get down there!
All of you! Get down there!

531
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:35,716
It's okay.

532
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:42,599
You remember this.
No matter where you go...

533
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:45,149
You fuck!

534
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:56,716
It's all right. It's all right.

535
01:15:56,880 --> 01:16:00,793
Now listen to me, Amy.
Honey, listen to me.

536
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:04,873
There's one more still out there,
you understand?

537
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:07,798
We need to get out of here fast.

538
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:20,599
Shit!

539
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:35,634
- Can you make it to that pickup truck?
- Okay.

540
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:37,313
Come on.

541
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:00,874
Okay, come on!

542
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:04,914
- Help!
- Billy! Billy!

543
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:15,797
- We gotta find those keys.
- Okay.

544
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:23,879
I'm Jeffrey Taylor.
This is an emergency.

545
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,879
I need the police. Someone's
trying to kill me and my wife!

546
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:31,077
I don't know the address.
We're on a farm.

547
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:34,392
Just start tracing this call.

548
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:35,835
Got them!

549
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:42,713
Get away!

550
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:53,390
Come on. Come on.

551
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:57,076
Give me the keys!

552
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:09,836
Come on!

553
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:11,793
Go!

554
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:30,318
Do you see him?

555
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:33,114
- Do you see him?
- No.

556
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:45,871
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

557
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:48,950
Look out! Look out!

558
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:51,918
Son of a bitch!

559
01:18:57,280 --> 01:18:59,271
Want some? Come on!

560
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:27,871
- Watch out!
- Hang on!

561
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:37,038
Fuck!

562
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:44,876
Fucker! You're gonna die!

563
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:21,471
Shit! I'm out!

564
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:48,873
- Jesus!
- No! No!

565
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:03,634
Go, Jeff!

566
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:10,551
- I can't get out!
- We gotta go!

567
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:13,872
I can't get out! I can't get out!

568
01:22:33,160 --> 01:22:34,354
Help!

569
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:41,312
Don't move. Don't move.

570
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:53,915
I'm gonna get you out now.

571
01:23:55,160 --> 01:23:59,153
Come here. Come on, come on.
All right.

572
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:03,755
Pull! Pull!

573
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,798
That's it! Come on, pull!

574
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:16,471
Are you all right?

575
