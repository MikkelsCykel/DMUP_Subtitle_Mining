00:01:18,292 --> 00:01:20,089
You're a big venue now.

2
00:01:21,896 --> 00:01:26,094
Global commerce,
sports franchises...

3
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,593
chit-chat cafes.

4
00:01:29,704 --> 00:01:32,298
But you don't get it
because you don't see it.

5
00:01:33,207 --> 00:01:35,402
Life is not what you think it is.

6
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:41,209
Because of guys like us...
you can go on thinking it...

7
00:01:41,315 --> 00:01:43,408
'til reality sets in.

8
00:01:45,019 --> 00:01:47,010
Reality's a motherfucker.

9
00:01:51,525 --> 00:01:53,925
The first thing you do
when it hits you...

10
00:01:54,328 --> 00:01:56,125
is wonder where we are.

11
00:01:57,231 --> 00:01:59,028
We do our shit.

12
00:01:59,934 --> 00:02:01,424
You do yours.

13
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:07,269
But remember...
it's a dirty world.

14
00:02:08,476 --> 00:02:12,674
And without us,
it'd be a whole lot dirtier.

15
00:02:14,181 --> 00:02:15,876
Welcome to Edison.

16
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:26,089
Heads up.
2 harbor cops just showed up.

17
00:02:26,193 --> 00:02:29,287
We got problems in here.
If they come into bank, shoot 'em.

18
00:02:31,399 --> 00:02:35,392
Any units near 12th and Plaza,
respond to an alarm at Plaza Bank.

19
00:02:35,503 --> 00:02:37,095
Approach with caution.

20
00:02:37,505 --> 00:02:38,995
We got it.

21
00:02:39,206 --> 00:02:40,696
What was that?

22
00:02:44,011 --> 00:02:46,809
You're outta your fuckin mind.
You know that? Fuck!

23
00:02:53,521 --> 00:02:55,614
- You want onions with that?
- Yeah.

24
00:02:55,823 --> 00:02:57,313
There you go.

25
00:03:21,282 --> 00:03:23,375
- Stay down!
- Stay down!

26
00:03:37,498 --> 00:03:38,988
Go.

27
00:04:08,963 --> 00:04:10,453
Get in the car!

28
00:04:10,664 --> 00:04:13,064
What are you doing?
Get in the car!

29
00:04:48,502 --> 00:04:51,300
Stay calm.
I know you're hurt.

30
00:05:06,453 --> 00:05:09,047
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

31
00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:13,756
Okay buddy.

32
00:05:13,861 --> 00:05:16,056
I know you're hurt.
Get you to your feet, okay?

33
00:05:17,264 --> 00:05:19,459
All your friends are dead,
fuckhead.

34
00:05:20,968 --> 00:05:22,959
It's just me and you now.

35
00:05:26,674 --> 00:05:30,269
Come on GI Joe.
Come out and play.

36
00:05:35,883 --> 00:05:37,373
Come on.

37
00:05:49,396 --> 00:05:53,799
Drop the gun, walk away,
or I'll kill her.

38
00:05:59,406 --> 00:06:03,740
Close your eyes, sweetheart.
You don't wanna see this.

39
00:06:24,264 --> 00:06:28,360
It's okay, come on.
Come on, it's okay.

40
00:06:29,069 --> 00:06:30,764
Just a flesh wound.

41
00:06:31,071 --> 00:06:32,971
It's okay.
You're alright.

42
00:06:38,278 --> 00:06:39,973
It's okay, baby.
It's okay.

43
00:06:40,481 --> 00:06:42,779
That bad man's not gonna
hurt you any more.

44
00:06:43,183 --> 00:06:44,673
It's okay.

45
00:07:09,043 --> 00:07:10,340
On your knees!
Come on!

46
00:07:10,444 --> 00:07:10,842
What's goin' on?

47
00:07:10,944 --> 00:07:13,435
- Lock your fingers behind!
- Put your hands behind your head.

48
00:07:13,547 --> 00:07:15,139
Come on crack whores!

49
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:19,144
Look at that China White, baby.
Look at that China fuckin' White.

50
00:07:19,253 --> 00:07:21,949
That's my money, too.
That's all my money.

51
00:07:22,056 --> 00:07:25,753
- Motherfucker.
- Okay, fuckhead. You squatters?

52
00:07:25,859 --> 00:07:26,757
Fuck you talkin' about?

53
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,452
- You own this house?
- No.

54
00:07:28,562 --> 00:07:29,756
- What about you?
- No.

55
00:07:29,863 --> 00:07:31,353
- You got a lease?
- No.

56
00:07:31,465 --> 00:07:34,957
You got a mortgage?
You guys fucked up tonight.

57
00:07:35,069 --> 00:07:36,969
Don't look at me.
Don't fuckin' look at me.

58
00:07:37,071 --> 00:07:38,663
Okay, this is how it works.

59
00:07:38,772 --> 00:07:42,173
You never saw us.
And we never saw you.

60
00:07:42,276 --> 00:07:44,870
The world just keeps turnin'.

61
00:07:44,978 --> 00:07:47,173
- You ain't takin' us in?
- Nah.

62
00:07:47,281 --> 00:07:48,976
Got to all school.

63
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:51,074
We answer up, get capped
for losin' that shit.

64
00:07:51,185 --> 00:07:53,278
Yeah, maybe you should
leave town.

65
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:58,781
Motha' fuckers.

66
00:07:58,892 --> 00:08:02,726
We'll get his license.
Rat his ass out to the Feds.

67
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:05,128
Tired of this bullshit.
Fuck that.

68
00:08:05,232 --> 00:08:06,722
Welcome to the majors.

69
00:08:07,334 --> 00:08:09,632
It gets easier after the first one.

70
00:08:24,852 --> 00:08:26,342
Him.

71
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:33,549
Rafe.

72
00:09:02,623 --> 00:09:04,113
Not ready, bro?

73
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:12,025
I'll take care of this shit.

74
00:09:14,535 --> 00:09:17,436
The fuck?
Oh, you motherfucker.

75
00:09:18,138 --> 00:09:22,734
You fuckin' spit at me?
I'll fuckin' kill you!

76
00:09:23,143 --> 00:09:24,633
Aw, Jesus.

77
00:09:25,646 --> 00:09:31,141
Jesus.
Jesus.

78
00:09:31,251 --> 00:09:34,550
Oh, Jesus, Jesus,
Jesus, Jesus.

79
00:09:36,356 --> 00:09:37,345
Come on.

80
00:09:37,457 --> 00:09:40,153
Come on. Stop cryin'.

81
00:09:42,162 --> 00:09:44,153
I haven't seen you
around here before.

82
00:09:44,264 --> 00:09:44,855
Who are you?

83
00:09:44,965 --> 00:09:48,867
Isiaha Charles.
I just moved here with my mom.

84
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:51,160
Who's he to you?

85
00:09:53,073 --> 00:09:55,769
I just met him.
He gave me a job.

86
00:09:58,278 --> 00:09:59,768
Where'd you do time?

87
00:10:00,781 --> 00:10:02,476
I've never done time.

88
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:04,676
- You never did time?
- No.

89
00:10:11,091 --> 00:10:14,492
Oh, that is good shit.

90
00:10:18,098 --> 00:10:19,588
You want some?

91
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,699
I'm good.

92
00:10:21,802 --> 00:10:24,100
All right.
This is how it's gonna work.

93
00:10:24,204 --> 00:10:28,504
Your buddy was smokin' crack
and he got fuckin' crazy...

94
00:10:28,609 --> 00:10:30,509
and he came at you with a knife.

95
00:10:35,415 --> 00:10:37,212
Now tell me what happened.

96
00:10:38,518 --> 00:10:42,818
My buddy, he got fuckin' crazy...

97
00:10:47,527 --> 00:10:49,722
and he came after me
with a knife.

98
00:10:50,731 --> 00:10:53,325
Which is when Lazerov
and I entered the domicile

99
00:10:53,433 --> 00:10:56,527
in response to
a domestic disturbance...

100
00:10:57,838 --> 00:11:00,432
and saw the defendant fire
one round from a bulldog.

101
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,474
- Is this that bulldog You refer to?
- Yes.

102
00:11:02,576 --> 00:11:05,773
- Is this the knife You pried from
the deceased's hand? - Yes

103
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:08,473
- What was he doing with him?
- Something to stab the defendant.

104
00:11:08,582 --> 00:11:14,487
Now after the deceased deceased
did the defendant resist?

105
00:11:14,588 --> 00:11:16,886
- No.
- Did he say anything?

106
00:11:19,593 --> 00:11:21,891
He cried, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.

107
00:11:22,095 --> 00:11:25,087
Cried?
What do you mean he cried?

108
00:11:31,905 --> 00:11:33,395
What do you mean he cried?

109
00:11:33,507 --> 00:11:35,202
He cried.
Jesus, Jesus.

110
00:11:35,309 --> 00:11:36,298
That's enough.

111
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:40,210
- Jesus. Oh my God.
- That's enough, Officer Deed.

112
00:11:40,314 --> 00:11:41,804
You may step down.

113
00:11:51,224 --> 00:11:52,714
Thank you.

114
00:11:54,528 --> 00:11:58,828
That'll be a 10 minute recess.
We'll reconvene at quarter past.

115
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,770
- What the hell was that?
- Testifying.

116
00:12:05,872 --> 00:12:07,863
- To the Second Coming?
- Back off.

117
00:12:07,975 --> 00:12:09,465
Officer Deed?

118
00:12:09,876 --> 00:12:11,366
Officer Deed.

119
00:12:11,979 --> 00:12:12,968
Yeah.

120
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,878
- Why'd he thank you?
- Who are you?

121
00:12:15,983 --> 00:12:17,678
Josh Pollack.
Heights Herald.

122
00:12:17,784 --> 00:12:20,685
- The Jewish handout?
- It's a community weekly.

123
00:12:20,787 --> 00:12:23,085
The guy is Jewish?
You're shittin' me.

124
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:24,880
I don't know he's Jewish.

125
00:12:25,492 --> 00:12:26,982
And, what do you care?

126
00:12:27,294 --> 00:12:30,286
You busted him in Ashtown,
that's adjacent to the Heights.

127
00:12:31,999 --> 00:12:36,402
Tell our Jewish friends not to worry.
They can still walk to worship.

128
00:12:40,507 --> 00:12:42,202
So why'd he say thank you?

129
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:46,208
It's a manslaughter
and possession beef.

130
00:12:46,313 --> 00:12:49,305
- It could've been murder.
- So Why did FRAT catch this?

131
00:12:51,618 --> 00:12:52,414
Talk to public affairs.

132
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:54,919
Officer Deed, can you tell me why
FRAT is cruising the streets?

133
00:12:55,022 --> 00:12:58,514
Talk to public affairs.

134
00:13:02,029 --> 00:13:03,462
Guy thanked you?

135
00:13:26,486 --> 00:13:29,887
Jack-off.
I hate that fuckin' guy.

136
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:33,787
- Who's that?
- Wallace. Pussy.

137
00:13:41,902 --> 00:13:43,392
Hey.

138
00:13:43,703 --> 00:13:45,500
How'd court go, Frank?

139
00:13:46,706 --> 00:13:49,800
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.

140
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:53,309
- Something I should know?
- No. Same old, Same old.

141
00:13:53,413 --> 00:13:55,506
Deed's first murder testimony.

142
00:13:56,116 --> 00:13:58,812
Yep, weapons possession
18 months.

143
00:13:59,119 --> 00:14:03,556
Rafe. Inspection Monday?
Be sure you're there.

144
00:14:33,386 --> 00:14:34,876
Pollack.

145
00:14:35,589 --> 00:14:37,079
Pollack!

146
00:14:41,495 --> 00:14:42,985
Pollack.

147
00:14:43,497 --> 00:14:44,589
Yes, sir?

148
00:14:44,698 --> 00:14:46,188
What are you doing?

149
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,492
Article on the murder trial.

150
00:14:50,303 --> 00:14:52,999
I told you to put the verdict
on the police blotter.

151
00:14:53,106 --> 00:14:55,700
That's a sentence, not a tome.

152
00:14:55,809 --> 00:14:57,208
It's a legitimate story.

153
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:59,210
Then find a legitimate paper
to publish it.

154
00:14:59,312 --> 00:15:02,110
All I want is the verdict, okay?

155
00:15:06,953 --> 00:15:08,443
Fraud.

156
00:15:10,457 --> 00:15:12,152
Sorry, did you say something?

157
00:15:15,262 --> 00:15:16,854
No, sir. I didn't.

158
00:15:18,465 --> 00:15:19,955
That's what I thought.

159
00:15:25,071 --> 00:15:27,562
Actually I said fraud.

160
00:15:34,181 --> 00:15:35,671
Did you now?

161
00:15:37,584 --> 00:15:40,178
You know why The Times
won't hire you Pollack?

162
00:15:41,087 --> 00:15:42,577
You don't do the work.

163
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:46,084
A thousand words, not a single
fact except for the verdict.

164
00:15:46,193 --> 00:15:48,491
Everything else is supposition.

165
00:15:48,595 --> 00:15:50,290
FRAT wouldn't talk to me.

166
00:15:51,097 --> 00:15:54,498
So the point of covert police
work is not to talk about it.

167
00:15:54,601 --> 00:15:56,592
This incident is public record, sir.

168
00:15:56,703 --> 00:16:00,104
Involving undercover police
who like to keep a low profile,

169
00:16:00,207 --> 00:16:01,504
so they can sleep at night.

170
00:16:01,608 --> 00:16:03,542
You can't imply nefarious activity

171
00:16:03,643 --> 00:16:06,043
because a felon whispered
thank you to one of them.

172
00:16:06,146 --> 00:16:07,841
I qualified it with a question.

173
00:16:07,948 --> 00:16:09,438
You qualified...

174
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:14,347
Watch my lips, son.
You're not qualified to qualify.

175
00:16:14,654 --> 00:16:16,053
Nobody cares what you think.

176
00:16:16,156 --> 00:16:20,149
Only what you know and that's
diddly 'cause you don't do the work!

177
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:24,060
Unfortunate this is about as well
written as you are uninformed.

178
00:16:24,965 --> 00:16:26,455
You know what?

179
00:16:26,967 --> 00:16:30,664
I think you should try novels.
You're fired.

180
00:16:47,187 --> 00:16:49,382
This isn't a real paper anyway.

181
00:16:49,489 --> 00:16:52,583
Perfect for you.
Lazy little shit.

182
00:16:54,194 --> 00:16:55,786
Get out while you can.

183
00:16:57,697 --> 00:16:59,187
Shit.

184
00:17:43,476 --> 00:17:45,467
Rafe.
Don't make yourself crazy.

185
00:17:45,578 --> 00:17:47,170
You're gonna give
yourself a hernia.

186
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,975
Come on. Let's go to bed.

187
00:17:55,488 --> 00:17:58,787
You want the free range
Chicken Kiev with potatoes

188
00:17:58,892 --> 00:18:02,419
or vegetables over risotto
in a bell pepper sauce?

189
00:18:02,529 --> 00:18:06,226
I'd like a meal prepared to order,
not manufactured for distribution.

190
00:18:07,534 --> 00:18:09,024
Ashford was right.

191
00:18:10,337 --> 00:18:11,531
About what?

192
00:18:11,638 --> 00:18:14,038
All this articulate conjecture
wrapped around one fact.

193
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:17,541
- Isiaha Charles, illegal weapons
possession. /- Right.

194
00:18:17,644 --> 00:18:20,841
- 8 words if you count the preposition.
- Another critic.

195
00:18:20,947 --> 00:18:23,245
- You asked me to read it.
- It was mistake.

196
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:25,045
Because I agree with him?

197
00:18:29,456 --> 00:18:30,252
Come on, sweetie.

198
00:18:30,357 --> 00:18:34,453
You know I thought being fired
was the highlight of my day.

199
00:18:39,866 --> 00:18:41,265
You're great sex.

200
00:18:41,368 --> 00:18:45,464
But imperious and penniless
are serious social handicaps

201
00:18:45,572 --> 00:18:48,370
and you should stick
with your strengths.

202
00:18:51,077 --> 00:18:53,068
I was hoping for sympathy.

203
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,770
Poor baby.

204
00:18:56,883 --> 00:18:58,783
Well, that woulda worked.

205
00:18:58,885 --> 00:19:00,580
Yeah, that's bullshit.

206
00:19:14,834 --> 00:19:16,324
Rafe.

207
00:19:17,937 --> 00:19:19,427
Talk to me, please.

208
00:19:22,542 --> 00:19:26,638
- Is It your headaches again?
- Leave It alone, please.

209
00:19:26,946 --> 00:19:28,538
I said I'm okay.

210
00:19:33,353 --> 00:19:34,752
What's wrong with you?
I'm worried.

211
00:19:34,854 --> 00:19:38,551
I'm okay. I'm all right.

212
00:19:48,468 --> 00:19:49,958
I'm gonna take a ride.

213
00:19:51,971 --> 00:19:54,462
Rafe please,
you need to get help.

214
00:20:09,589 --> 00:20:11,682
He couldn't'a done better,
believe me.

215
00:20:22,702 --> 00:20:24,397
Hey, Rafe, what's up?

216
00:20:24,504 --> 00:20:26,199
You're almost a no-show
for inspection.

217
00:20:26,306 --> 00:20:28,103
Oh, no no.
I had dinner at Maria's.

218
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:30,005
I thought you were ending that.

219
00:20:31,211 --> 00:20:32,508
I am gonna process ending it.

220
00:20:32,612 --> 00:20:36,013
You can get inspected every day of
the week, Rafe, if you need it.

221
00:20:37,517 --> 00:20:39,508
But there are no exceptions.

222
00:20:39,819 --> 00:20:41,514
I need your commitment.

223
00:20:44,224 --> 00:20:47,819
I made my commitment.
That's for sure.

224
00:20:49,729 --> 00:20:52,823
All right.
Let's go have some fun.

225
00:20:58,037 --> 00:21:00,028
- Say hello to Marilyn.
- Hey, Marilyn.

226
00:21:00,139 --> 00:21:03,870
Hey, hero.
The girls'll be happy to see you.

227
00:21:08,982 --> 00:21:11,473
He's making me
a little bit nervous.

228
00:21:49,122 --> 00:21:50,817
You stalking me now?

229
00:21:51,524 --> 00:21:54,322
- I'm not lazy.
- You're stoned.

230
00:21:54,427 --> 00:21:56,827
And you are a vision
of temperance.

231
00:22:18,384 --> 00:22:21,683
- This Is Cambodia.
- It was Kampuchea at the time.

232
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:26,286
Wow. I knew you used
to be somebody but

233
00:22:26,392 --> 00:22:29,486
- You're burying the lead, kid.
- Come on man, I'm a good writer.

234
00:22:29,596 --> 00:22:30,290
So what?

235
00:22:30,396 --> 00:22:32,091
That builds strong papers.

236
00:22:32,198 --> 00:22:34,393
- And this story Is impor...
- Pollack.

237
00:22:34,601 --> 00:22:36,000
I don't publish stories.

238
00:22:36,102 --> 00:22:40,903
I publish coupons for merchants who
don't kidnap competition,

239
00:22:41,007 --> 00:22:43,999
bomb busses
or immolate themselves.

240
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:47,206
- Am I wrong about the story?
- What do I know?

241
00:22:47,313 --> 00:22:49,804
- Help me get It right.
- Do the work.

242
00:22:50,717 --> 00:22:54,619
I was in court, I took notes
and tried to talk to FRAT.

243
00:22:54,721 --> 00:22:56,621
Talk to the defendant, huh?

244
00:22:56,723 --> 00:22:58,213
He's in Longworth.

245
00:22:58,324 --> 00:23:00,121
Afraid to visit prison?

246
00:23:00,226 --> 00:23:03,559
How am I talk to somebody who
knows the defendant well.

247
00:23:03,663 --> 00:23:05,961
How about visiting the scene of
the crime, make an assessment.

248
00:23:06,065 --> 00:23:07,555
Okay.

249
00:23:09,569 --> 00:23:12,766
- You're right.
- As if I need your affirmation.

250
00:23:15,875 --> 00:23:18,673
I'm not telling you to do this.
I'm telling you not to.

251
00:23:19,278 --> 00:23:20,768
Could be dangerous.

252
00:23:21,481 --> 00:23:23,073
Will you help me or not?

253
00:23:25,084 --> 00:23:27,382
Why the sudden urge
to get this right?

254
00:23:28,087 --> 00:23:29,782
My girlfriend read it.

255
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:32,580
Agreed with you.

256
00:23:34,093 --> 00:23:37,790
Right.
You're doin' this for pussy.

257
00:23:38,398 --> 00:23:41,799
- Well I wouldn't put it that way.
- For Pussy.

258
00:23:45,505 --> 00:23:46,995
What happened to you?

259
00:23:47,907 --> 00:23:49,898
Don't talk to the system.

260
00:23:50,209 --> 00:23:52,109
What the hell does that mean?

261
00:23:53,012 --> 00:23:54,502
Make up somethin'.

262
00:24:48,201 --> 00:24:49,691
5:52 a.m.

263
00:24:54,507 --> 00:24:58,409
The call was for a D and D,
domestic disturbance.

264
00:24:58,511 --> 00:25:01,002
We knocked.
Couldn't be heard over the shouting.

265
00:25:01,114 --> 00:25:04,242
Well the time, 5:52 a.m.

266
00:25:07,954 --> 00:25:10,946
5: 17, 6: 10.

267
00:25:12,859 --> 00:25:14,349
There's no 5:52.

268
00:25:20,566 --> 00:25:22,261
No report that date and address.

269
00:25:22,368 --> 00:25:26,464
Filed by a Sergeant Francis Lazerov,
or an Officer Raphael Deed.

270
00:25:26,572 --> 00:25:29,473
- FRAT files aren't public record.
- Why?

271
00:25:29,575 --> 00:25:32,373
- We can't speak for FRAT.
- Who can?

272
00:25:33,479 --> 00:25:34,468
FRAT.

273
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:37,981
Even if you were with a real paper
I wouldn't talk to you. That's Policy.

274
00:25:38,084 --> 00:25:40,177
It's public record, Captain Tilman.

275
00:25:40,586 --> 00:25:43,578
It's trial and conviction.
Not us, alright?

276
00:25:43,689 --> 00:25:45,179
Here we go.

277
00:25:46,692 --> 00:25:50,184
If you're gonna turn every beef
between two losers into headlines

278
00:25:50,296 --> 00:25:54,892
that's gonna seriously compromise
our ability to social deviancy.

279
00:25:55,401 --> 00:25:59,394
You know, we might as well
pack it up and close shop.

280
00:25:59,605 --> 00:26:02,438
Screw John Q. Citizen.
Is that what you want?

281
00:26:03,242 --> 00:26:04,732
I don't think so.

282
00:26:05,845 --> 00:26:06,937
Have a good one.

283
00:26:07,046 --> 00:26:08,536
- Bern!
- Sir.

284
00:26:08,648 --> 00:26:12,948
It's Capt. Tilman, head of First
Response Assault & Tactical Unit.

285
00:26:13,052 --> 00:26:14,451
Thanks a large part
to this gentleman

286
00:26:14,554 --> 00:26:17,648
we're looking at an 82% reduction
in homicides, 69 in felonies,

287
00:26:17,757 --> 00:26:19,657
71 in sexual assault.

288
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:22,455
With those number we can have
early intervention program.

289
00:26:22,562 --> 00:26:26,054
In fact I see a day when
we won't need courts at all.

290
00:26:29,468 --> 00:26:31,265
- Hi.
- No, You Stay away.

291
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:35,363
No. I'm just looking for
somebody. Ms. Melba Charles?

292
00:26:35,875 --> 00:26:37,365
She lives here, right?

293
00:26:38,477 --> 00:26:39,967
She's over there.

294
00:26:56,495 --> 00:26:57,985
Oh, Jesus.

295
00:27:25,658 --> 00:27:29,458
Isiaha Charles?
I'm Josh Pollack, I'm a writer.

296
00:27:29,662 --> 00:27:33,063
- I was at your trial.
- Oh, Yeah.

297
00:27:33,165 --> 00:27:34,655
Here.

298
00:27:40,573 --> 00:27:42,063
Listen.

299
00:27:42,775 --> 00:27:46,472
After Officer Deed testified,
you said thank you.

300
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:49,470
Why?

301
00:27:51,183 --> 00:27:53,174
I can't talk about the trial.

302
00:27:55,187 --> 00:27:56,882
Can we talk about you?

303
00:27:57,890 --> 00:27:59,585
Who you were before this?

304
00:28:01,394 --> 00:28:05,228
By the way, I'm very sorry
about your mother.

305
00:28:06,732 --> 00:28:08,222
What about my mother?

306
00:28:08,434 --> 00:28:09,924
Her stroke.

307
00:28:10,236 --> 00:28:11,726
Stroke?

308
00:28:13,239 --> 00:28:16,436
- You don't know.
- Whoa, when?

309
00:28:16,842 --> 00:28:19,436
- A few days ago, I guess.
- How bad of a stroke?

310
00:28:20,446 --> 00:28:22,141
Is my mother a vegetable?

311
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:25,440
I'm sorry.

312
00:28:25,952 --> 00:28:27,442
Oh, Mama.

313
00:28:29,155 --> 00:28:31,146
Motherfuckers!

314
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:37,261
A'ight, look.
You gotta get me outta here.

315
00:28:37,363 --> 00:28:38,557
You gotta get me to my mother.

316
00:28:38,664 --> 00:28:40,461
- I can't.
- No, You can.

317
00:28:40,566 --> 00:28:44,263
If you get me out of here, I'll tell you
everything you want about the trial.

318
00:28:45,571 --> 00:28:48,165
- I don't know how.
- The way they capped Rook.

319
00:28:48,274 --> 00:28:50,572
- What?
- Stole the crack, the 40 G's.

320
00:28:50,676 --> 00:28:53,770
Made up that shit about the knife.
I'll tell you all of that.

321
00:28:56,182 --> 00:28:57,672
Ma...

322
00:28:59,085 --> 00:29:00,575
I love you.

323
00:29:00,786 --> 00:29:02,253
You hang on.

324
00:29:03,422 --> 00:29:05,014
I'll be home soon.

325
00:29:06,826 --> 00:29:08,316
I promise.

326
00:29:12,932 --> 00:29:15,730
You get this to her.
You promise me.

327
00:29:23,342 --> 00:29:24,832
Fuck!

328
00:29:27,546 --> 00:29:29,036
I'm sorry.

329
00:29:41,961 --> 00:29:43,451
Mrs. Charles.

330
00:29:44,663 --> 00:29:48,759
Ma, I love you.
You hang on.

331
00:29:49,368 --> 00:29:52,462
I'll be home soon.
I promise.

332
00:30:06,786 --> 00:30:09,482
You call me now?
I'm not your personal editor.

333
00:30:09,588 --> 00:30:11,078
Just read this.

334
00:30:54,934 --> 00:30:56,424
This is a Pulitzer.

335
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:59,026
What's it for?

336
00:30:59,238 --> 00:31:01,638
Blowing the judging committee.
What do you think?

337
00:31:02,575 --> 00:31:04,975
You saw Isiaha's arrest report?

338
00:31:05,578 --> 00:31:07,170
Copies of the court transcript.

339
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:10,180
- No mention of cash, coke or guns?
- No.

340
00:31:10,282 --> 00:31:13,274
- The emergency dispatch?
- The copy's there.

341
00:31:13,786 --> 00:31:17,483
There's no record of a 911
that time, date, address.

342
00:31:18,991 --> 00:31:23,690
You talked to the District Attorney,
the Public Defender, Judge.

343
00:31:24,396 --> 00:31:26,387
You told me not to
talk to the system.

344
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,690
What do you think?

345
00:31:30,302 --> 00:31:32,793
It could dismantle the
department when it's done.

346
00:31:32,905 --> 00:31:34,395
What's missing?

347
00:31:35,307 --> 00:31:37,104
The other side of the story.

348
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:39,402
They're murderers.

349
00:31:40,112 --> 00:31:42,307
If you believe Isiaha Charles.

350
00:31:43,015 --> 00:31:44,915
You won't publish it as is?

351
00:31:45,117 --> 00:31:46,914
I won't publish it at all.

352
00:31:47,219 --> 00:31:49,710
But The Times will if you
get the department's side.

353
00:31:49,822 --> 00:31:52,313
The department?
They're murderers.

354
00:31:54,627 --> 00:31:57,118
Right.
You're doing this for pussy.

355
00:32:02,368 --> 00:32:04,165
I'm doin' it for this.

356
00:32:10,776 --> 00:32:12,767
Fourth estate, Pollack.

357
00:32:13,879 --> 00:32:17,781
It's the only job protected by
the Constitution, and this is why.

358
00:32:18,284 --> 00:32:19,774
This is tyranny.

359
00:32:19,985 --> 00:32:22,783
When you see it
you're obligated to yell.

360
00:32:22,988 --> 00:32:25,980
A risk you're unwilling to take,
and I don't blame you.

361
00:32:26,692 --> 00:32:30,594
In your new enlightenment I'll take
you back to the Herald,

362
00:32:30,696 --> 00:32:34,393
but don't call yourself a journalist.

363
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,400
The coupon king has spoken.

364
00:32:39,205 --> 00:32:40,695
Good night, Pollack.

365
00:32:42,208 --> 00:32:44,506
Oh, here, take this with you.

366
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:48,204
Go on, leave. Leave.

367
00:33:28,988 --> 00:33:30,478
Go.

368
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:32,480
- Get the door.
- Got it.

369
00:33:57,516 --> 00:34:00,508
You move, you die!
Spread 'em! Spread 'em!

370
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,960
- Here.
- Against the wall.

371
00:34:10,362 --> 00:34:11,852
Hey Deed!

372
00:34:12,665 --> 00:34:14,462
I got somethin' for ya!

373
00:34:14,767 --> 00:34:16,257
Come on, baseball.

374
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:19,360
Watch your step!

375
00:34:21,573 --> 00:34:23,063
Fuck.

376
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:30,177
Shut up, gimme your other hand.

377
00:34:32,384 --> 00:34:34,284
Shut up.
All right, let's go.

378
00:34:36,588 --> 00:34:39,386
Bern, I owe you... Anything

379
00:34:39,491 --> 00:34:42,790
Not now, not here.
Girls, come out everybody come out.

380
00:34:42,895 --> 00:34:44,385
- Laz.
- Yeah.

381
00:34:44,797 --> 00:34:46,389
Take the girls out.
I'm going downstairs.

382
00:34:46,498 --> 00:34:47,988
- Party at my house.
- Line up Here.

383
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,897
- Let's go.
- Come on, sweetie.

384
00:34:51,804 --> 00:34:53,999
Come on.
Come on.

385
00:34:55,908 --> 00:34:57,307
Here ya go, cupcake.

386
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:59,302
The fuck am I gonna do with this?

387
00:35:01,113 --> 00:35:03,445
I thought you gave up
muckraking, Moses.

388
00:35:05,451 --> 00:35:06,941
It's Pollack's story.

389
00:35:11,056 --> 00:35:13,149
You heard of anything
like this, Levon?

390
00:35:13,258 --> 00:35:15,749
Sure all the time.
From felons.

391
00:35:15,861 --> 00:35:17,351
Well, there it is.

392
00:35:17,963 --> 00:35:21,763
D.A. 's office doesn't comment on
unsubstantiated accusations.

393
00:35:22,768 --> 00:35:25,566
Why don't you come back
when you have specifics?

394
00:35:25,971 --> 00:35:29,168
- We can't be more specific.
- What are We talking about?

395
00:35:29,274 --> 00:35:32,072
Innuendo? Hearsay?

396
00:35:33,779 --> 00:35:37,977
D.A. Needs names.
Otherwise the office can't respond.

397
00:35:38,584 --> 00:35:42,987
Jack, when did you start referring
to yourself as an inanimate object?

398
00:35:46,492 --> 00:35:48,392
You run a community weekly Moses

399
00:35:48,494 --> 00:35:53,796
and I'll always have time for you
but now that time is up.

400
00:35:55,701 --> 00:35:57,191
Mr. Pollack.

401
00:35:57,403 --> 00:36:00,304
Mr. Reigert. Mr. Wallace.

402
00:36:03,041 --> 00:36:05,236
These aren't the good old days,
Moses.

403
00:36:05,644 --> 00:36:07,441
They never were, Jack.

404
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:13,150
- Why wouldn't you give him
- Huh-uh.

405
00:36:13,252 --> 00:36:15,345
- If You were to just
- Not now.

406
00:36:17,055 --> 00:36:18,750
Ashford doesn't come here easily.

407
00:36:18,857 --> 00:36:21,849
He didn't have anything
specific or actual either.

408
00:36:22,461 --> 00:36:25,259
Ignore it.
I'm not insulting Tilman with this.

409
00:36:25,364 --> 00:36:26,854
Yeah, it's Jack.

410
00:36:27,166 --> 00:36:28,656
Can you come on over?

411
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:33,368
- Why weren't you more specific?
- You have a source to protect.

412
00:36:33,472 --> 00:36:35,372
I was that vague, you fired me.

413
00:36:36,175 --> 00:36:39,576
Do you know how
pervasive this is?

414
00:36:39,878 --> 00:36:41,072
Are you think they're involved?

415
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:43,671
I don't know who's involved,
and neither do you.

416
00:36:44,183 --> 00:36:46,083
Than why did we
even come here?

417
00:36:46,385 --> 00:36:49,183
Levon Wallace,
city's best investigator.

418
00:36:49,288 --> 00:36:51,984
If the story holds up
he'll confirm it.

419
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:53,580
What do we do now?

420
00:36:54,993 --> 00:36:57,985
I publish coupons.
You should look for a job.

421
00:36:58,096 --> 00:37:00,189
- Mr. Ashford
- Look, kid.

422
00:37:00,299 --> 00:37:05,134
You've got a story, access to the
D.A. And his best investigator.

423
00:37:05,237 --> 00:37:08,434
If you can't make a career of that
you don't belong in this business.

424
00:37:10,242 --> 00:37:11,231
Mr. Ashford.

425
00:37:11,343 --> 00:37:14,540
Stop the Mister. Okay?
I'm outta this game.

426
00:37:14,847 --> 00:37:17,338
And your late night visits irk me.

427
00:37:17,649 --> 00:37:19,048
If Wallace confirms your story,

428
00:37:19,151 --> 00:37:22,746
then you have to put the question
to Tilman, Lazerov, and Deed.

429
00:37:22,855 --> 00:37:26,256
Use a phone.
And pray they don't take the call.

430
00:37:28,861 --> 00:37:29,850
Moses!

431
00:37:29,962 --> 00:37:32,954
Look, kid.
It's Friday.

432
00:37:33,065 --> 00:37:36,364
Go do what you're supposed to do.
Go get laid, for christ sake.

433
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:00,988
- Outta the way.
- I wasn't doin' a thing.

434
00:38:01,093 --> 00:38:02,526
Yeah, whatever.

435
00:38:06,431 --> 00:38:09,423
- Look out.
- All right!

436
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:27,841
Hey.
Just here to dance.

437
00:38:29,755 --> 00:38:31,245
Have a good time.

438
00:39:04,623 --> 00:39:06,113
What?

439
00:39:07,225 --> 00:39:12,128
Oh, my God...
Poppy.

440
00:39:37,556 --> 00:39:39,046
Pollack.

441
00:39:41,059 --> 00:39:43,653
- Who's that?
- He's a reporter.

442
00:39:46,865 --> 00:39:48,355
We have to go.

443
00:39:48,467 --> 00:39:50,458
- Why?
- We have to go.

444
00:39:57,075 --> 00:40:00,476
- That's the guy from your story.
- Shh.

445
00:40:01,279 --> 00:40:03,474
He's kinda cute, right?

446
00:40:03,882 --> 00:40:05,281
Are you dating other people?

447
00:40:05,384 --> 00:40:07,477
Don't worry. Looks like
he just got engaged.

448
00:40:07,586 --> 00:40:10,282
I saw that.
Tough break for you.

449
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:16,484
You never put a face on it do you?
Once published, it will ruin his life.

450
00:40:16,595 --> 00:40:18,392
I'm not ruining his life.

451
00:40:18,597 --> 00:40:22,590
I said your story.
God, it is always about you, right?

452
00:40:23,301 --> 00:40:26,202
I do think about that. Okay.

453
00:40:26,605 --> 00:40:28,698
I think about ruining somebody's
life.

454
00:40:28,807 --> 00:40:30,297
You're not gonna get
self-absorbed and mopey?

455
00:40:30,409 --> 00:40:32,809
Don't get all soft and mopey

456
00:40:37,616 --> 00:40:39,413
Hey, what are you doing?

457
00:40:41,319 --> 00:40:43,617
- What happened?
- Come on. Move it!

458
00:40:46,224 --> 00:40:47,714
Get outta the way!

459
00:40:50,128 --> 00:40:51,618
Move! Move!

460
00:41:02,974 --> 00:41:04,669
Don't move, help's comin'.

461
00:41:04,776 --> 00:41:06,266
Aw, fuck.

462
00:41:07,479 --> 00:41:11,677
Officer Deed, Edison P. D. I have 2
down outside the Plaza Nightclub.

463
00:41:12,584 --> 00:41:13,881
I have a medical bracelet here.

464
00:41:13,985 --> 00:41:18,388
It says serum prothrombin
conversion, blood type O.

465
00:41:22,594 --> 00:41:23,390
Stay still, buddy. Help's comin'.

466
00:41:23,495 --> 00:41:25,986
- She needs help.
- I know. Stay still.

467
00:41:44,616 --> 00:41:46,106
You okay?

468
00:41:47,619 --> 00:41:49,109
Yeah.

469
00:42:48,213 --> 00:42:50,204
Hell. Shit.

470
00:42:56,121 --> 00:42:57,611
Wallace?

471
00:42:57,722 --> 00:42:59,713
You ever answer your
fucking phone?

472
00:42:59,825 --> 00:43:00,120
You?

473
00:43:00,225 --> 00:43:01,624
I've been up all night.

474
00:43:01,726 --> 00:43:05,355
Pollack got the shit kicked up
last night, so did Willow.

475
00:43:05,463 --> 00:43:06,760
What? Who?

476
00:43:06,865 --> 00:43:10,062
His girlfriend.
They're in the hospital.

477
00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:13,760
How bad?

478
00:43:14,973 --> 00:43:16,463
She's in a coma.

479
00:43:17,275 --> 00:43:22,269
She's got factor seven deficiency.
It's a blood disorder.

480
00:43:23,281 --> 00:43:25,772
They don't know how
she's gonna survive.

481
00:43:26,484 --> 00:43:27,974
And Pollack?

482
00:43:28,687 --> 00:43:30,780
Took a beating but he'll be all right.

483
00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:33,080
Mugged?

484
00:43:33,992 --> 00:43:35,482
Warned.

485
00:43:51,009 --> 00:43:52,499
Who are you?

486
00:43:54,813 --> 00:43:57,008
Deed. Edison P. D.
Who are you?

487
00:44:00,018 --> 00:44:02,452
- You don't wanna be here.
- Who are you?

488
00:44:03,154 --> 00:44:05,748
Moses Ashford,
I own the paper he works for.

489
00:44:09,561 --> 00:44:12,052
- How bad Is he?
- He's banged up.

490
00:44:12,364 --> 00:44:14,559
Sedated. Do you care?

491
00:44:20,872 --> 00:44:23,170
- Tell him somethin'?
- Tell him What?

492
00:44:23,275 --> 00:44:24,867
Tell him I have nothing
to do with this.

493
00:44:24,976 --> 00:44:27,376
- With What?
- You gonna Tell him or not?

494
00:44:37,589 --> 00:44:39,079
Officer Deed.

495
00:44:41,993 --> 00:44:43,893
Is there any hope for you, son?

496
00:44:46,598 --> 00:44:48,088
No.

497
00:44:50,201 --> 00:44:51,190
Let go.

498
00:44:51,303 --> 00:44:53,203
- What are you doin'?
- Go me.

499
00:45:00,412 --> 00:45:02,107
It's not safe for him here.

500
00:45:02,647 --> 00:45:04,137
Move him somewhere safe.

501
00:45:12,958 --> 00:45:14,448
Come in.

502
00:45:17,862 --> 00:45:20,057
Make yourself as
comfortable as you can.

503
00:45:20,165 --> 00:45:23,566
The market will deliver.
It's on Wallace's tab.

504
00:45:23,668 --> 00:45:26,967
You have run of the house,
but, no matches.

505
00:45:27,072 --> 00:45:29,563
- No fire at All near the barn.
- You told me.

506
00:45:29,674 --> 00:45:32,268
All that dry hay could catch fire.

507
00:45:32,377 --> 00:45:36,279
This place has been in
Wallace's family for years.

508
00:45:36,381 --> 00:45:37,370
Why do I have to stay here?

509
00:45:37,482 --> 00:45:40,178
You don't have to stay here.
Take a plane, go home to mommy.

510
00:45:40,285 --> 00:45:41,377
I wanna be near Willow.

511
00:45:41,486 --> 00:45:43,579
Believe me, it's safer
both of you if you're here.

512
00:45:43,688 --> 00:45:45,383
When I publish.

513
00:45:45,490 --> 00:45:46,980
You can't publish.

514
00:45:47,792 --> 00:45:50,090
- Why not?
- Look at what they did to me!

515
00:45:50,996 --> 00:45:54,898
Serious journalism doesn't
look so good up close, huh?

516
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:59,302
It's a little hard to tell with this large
thing hanging over my eye, thanks.

517
00:46:01,006 --> 00:46:02,633
So who's a fraud now?

518
00:46:02,741 --> 00:46:05,437
You know what? You don't
even know what it's like.

519
00:46:08,346 --> 00:46:09,643
Life's a bitch, ain't it?

520
00:46:09,748 --> 00:46:14,151
Think you can swim, then it's oh
shit, where are my water wings?

521
00:46:14,252 --> 00:46:15,947
This isn't from swimming pool.

522
00:46:16,054 --> 00:46:18,454
No, this is what you aspire to.

523
00:46:19,257 --> 00:46:21,248
You want a prize?
Here's your shot.

524
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:26,460
See when you asked Charles
to tell you his story you committed.

525
00:46:26,664 --> 00:46:30,760
Now you have a moral duty.
People depending on you.

526
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:35,462
Doesn't get any better than that, kid.

527
00:46:38,276 --> 00:46:41,370
Hey, why are you doin'
this to me?

528
00:46:41,579 --> 00:46:44,673
Cause you did it to me.
I'll call you later.

529
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:52,940
How can I help you, Frank?

530
00:47:53,352 --> 00:47:54,944
Why were you at that club?

531
00:47:57,055 --> 00:48:01,253
Yoga, exercises, aerobics.
What do you think? I was dancin'.

532
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:01,849
Dancin'?

533
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:04,292
Yeah. It's a dance club, Frank.

534
00:48:04,396 --> 00:48:06,887
I'm fuckin' James Brown.
Watch me.

535
00:48:07,499 --> 00:48:08,989
- Ow!
- Yeah, I feel good.

536
00:48:09,101 --> 00:48:11,899
- I got soul.
- Neck bones, candy ass.

537
00:48:12,004 --> 00:48:15,804
- Right, Right, right. Right.
- Oh.

538
00:48:17,409 --> 00:48:19,400
- After You clocked out...
- Hm?

539
00:48:19,511 --> 00:48:21,411
- Tilman got a call.
- Right.

540
00:48:21,513 --> 00:48:23,606
That Herald reporter was
makin' noise at the Hall.

541
00:48:23,715 --> 00:48:27,811
Nothin' hardcore but
he had to come to Jesus.

542
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:30,112
The girl need one, too?

543
00:48:32,524 --> 00:48:33,923
I didn't know
she had bad blood.

544
00:48:34,026 --> 00:48:36,426
- I figured She was a bonus.
- Right.

545
00:48:36,528 --> 00:48:40,328
Gave him a sermon, he's pissed
chapter and verse the girlfriend.

546
00:48:40,432 --> 00:48:43,629
- He won't be gettin' dumb now.
- Yeah.

547
00:48:43,735 --> 00:48:45,225
This is from Tilman.

548
00:48:46,738 --> 00:48:49,332
- You gotta worry.
- Right.

549
00:48:49,641 --> 00:48:52,337
Pollack.
The kid's got nothin'.

550
00:48:52,444 --> 00:48:53,934
His source.

551
00:48:55,447 --> 00:48:56,937
Who?

552
00:48:58,150 --> 00:49:00,948
Your Jesus buddy got
shanked at Longworth.

553
00:49:04,089 --> 00:49:05,579
Drive safe.

554
00:49:41,827 --> 00:49:43,317
Fuck.

555
00:49:46,031 --> 00:49:47,623
Who the hell told you?

556
00:49:47,733 --> 00:49:51,430
Lazerov said it came from you.
I went to the hospital, went in there.

557
00:49:52,137 --> 00:49:54,037
And I saw a some guy,
I don't know who it was.

558
00:49:54,139 --> 00:49:58,838
And I was Deed.
Deed was talking to him I left.

559
00:49:58,944 --> 00:50:02,243
Lazerov said?
When did that start?

560
00:50:02,347 --> 00:50:03,336
Please, give me a break.

561
00:50:03,448 --> 00:50:05,143
- Give You a break?
- You know What Lazerov said

562
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:07,650
Can you over the hospital he's
taking you and Wu to the hospital,

563
00:50:07,753 --> 00:50:09,243
nobody's calling me,
nobody's saying anything.

564
00:50:09,354 --> 00:50:10,946
I thought you knew.
It's not up to me.

565
00:50:11,056 --> 00:50:12,148
How do I know?

566
00:50:12,257 --> 00:50:13,053
Oh, shit.

567
00:50:13,158 --> 00:50:13,852
Well thank you.

568
00:50:13,959 --> 00:50:19,659
Thanks for dropping by
and laying this shit on me.

569
00:50:21,867 --> 00:50:23,266
Hospital security.

570
00:50:24,269 --> 00:50:26,260
- Lazerov?
- You got that For me?

571
00:50:26,671 --> 00:50:29,572
Yeah, Pollack was released
to Wallace and Ashford.

572
00:50:29,674 --> 00:50:31,164
What'd you get?

573
00:50:32,077 --> 00:50:33,874
Nothin' that can't be mitigated.

574
00:50:34,279 --> 00:50:38,477
Except maybe the photos,
taken before help arrived.

575
00:50:40,285 --> 00:50:42,583
And there's a bad news.

576
00:50:43,989 --> 00:50:46,184
- Charles Is dead.
- What?

577
00:50:46,291 --> 00:50:47,690
Knifed at Longworth.

578
00:50:47,793 --> 00:50:51,889
Great. If Charles is dead,
we got nothin'.

579
00:50:52,697 --> 00:50:54,392
We got a bigger problem.

580
00:50:56,401 --> 00:51:00,804
FRAT collars dealers
with drugs, guns, flesh.

581
00:51:01,106 --> 00:51:02,539
Guilty verdicts.

582
00:51:02,841 --> 00:51:05,332
Whatever FRAT confiscates,
FRAT keeps.

583
00:51:05,444 --> 00:51:09,540
$12 million cash
in the past 5 years.

584
00:51:09,948 --> 00:51:14,044
Six million dollars for ordnance.
Four million for surveillance.

585
00:51:14,152 --> 00:51:17,553
Tilman overpays by two,
three, 400 percent.

586
00:51:17,656 --> 00:51:19,647
But take a look at
who he's buying from.

587
00:51:19,758 --> 00:51:21,248
Surveillance from midland.

588
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:24,055
PC's from high tower.
Arms from Phoenix.

589
00:51:24,162 --> 00:51:27,154
Oh, Digi-Vector
they built FRAT's website.

590
00:51:28,767 --> 00:51:31,565
They own sports teams.

591
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:33,968
Car dealerships.
Retail chains.

592
00:51:34,072 --> 00:51:35,061
City's leadership.

593
00:51:35,173 --> 00:51:40,167
And the founders of
the Better Edison Foundation.

594
00:51:40,278 --> 00:51:41,370
When did this pop up?

595
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:45,075
It hasn't yet.
Official opening's next week.

596
00:51:47,886 --> 00:51:49,285
Reigert.

597
00:51:49,387 --> 00:51:51,685
It's a political action committee.

598
00:51:51,790 --> 00:51:54,588
The overpayments
end up right here.

599
00:51:54,693 --> 00:51:55,591
Money laundering.

600
00:51:55,694 --> 00:51:58,595
Yeah well, we're not gonna
find any memos on that.

601
00:51:59,197 --> 00:52:02,928
You showed me the bones
of a covert fascist state.

602
00:52:06,438 --> 00:52:07,336
Methodist Hospital.

603
00:52:07,439 --> 00:52:11,034
Hi, I'm checking on a patient,
Willow Summerfield.

604
00:52:11,143 --> 00:52:12,735
Are you a relative?

605
00:52:12,844 --> 00:52:15,540
I'm a friend.
I was in the hospital with her.

606
00:52:15,647 --> 00:52:17,842
Oh. One moment.

607
00:52:23,355 --> 00:52:24,845
Shit.

608
00:52:29,161 --> 00:52:30,856
Just spread it out here.

609
00:52:34,366 --> 00:52:35,663
FRAT's basic profile.

610
00:52:35,767 --> 00:52:40,761
Six-two, 200 plus pounds.
Perfect rifle, pistol scores...

611
00:52:40,872 --> 00:52:45,673
each one of 'em prior to joining
FRAT had three physical...

612
00:52:45,777 --> 00:52:47,472
fights in their jackets.

613
00:52:47,579 --> 00:52:49,376
None are married, no kids.

614
00:52:49,481 --> 00:52:53,076
The night Pollack was attacked,
he was there.

615
00:52:53,185 --> 00:52:55,779
- Why Is that a surprise.
- He was with a girl.

616
00:52:56,188 --> 00:53:00,090
She kept lookin' at an engagement
ring like she just got it.

617
00:53:01,193 --> 00:53:02,626
So two things.

618
00:53:03,728 --> 00:53:09,530
You don't take your honey to
a tune-up and FRAT don't marry.

619
00:53:27,852 --> 00:53:29,342
Come on.

620
00:54:12,631 --> 00:54:16,829
I really like living alone but,
I'm beginning to think...

621
00:54:16,935 --> 00:54:18,425
What?

622
00:54:19,137 --> 00:54:21,731
I think I need a woman in my life.

623
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:24,031
Well, shit, don't look at me.

624
00:54:25,944 --> 00:54:27,434
He's not answerin'.

625
00:54:34,853 --> 00:54:36,252
You dialed the wrong number.

626
00:54:36,354 --> 00:54:39,050
I know my number,
I dialed it twice.

627
00:54:40,859 --> 00:54:42,349
He's gone.

628
00:55:45,657 --> 00:55:47,454
Motherfucker!

629
00:55:54,966 --> 00:55:57,059
Damn it. Why don't I
call the County Sheriff?

630
00:55:57,268 --> 00:56:00,169
The County Sheriff is Tilman's
duck hunting partner.

631
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:17,110
There. There.

632
00:56:27,932 --> 00:56:29,126
Josh!

633
00:56:29,234 --> 00:56:30,531
What the fuck are you doing?

634
00:56:30,635 --> 00:56:35,038
Lazerov was at the farm!
I blew up that bastard's car.

635
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:37,030
You blew up his car.

636
00:56:37,242 --> 00:56:38,732
He was gonna kill me.

637
00:56:39,043 --> 00:56:40,533
Jesus Christ.

638
00:56:41,246 --> 00:56:43,737
Well Tilman'll rein Lazerov
in for goin' to my house

639
00:56:43,848 --> 00:56:47,249
but it doesn't mean you're safe.
He's homicidal.

640
00:56:47,352 --> 00:56:49,047
He's killed 6 in the line of duty.

641
00:56:49,154 --> 00:56:51,645
Six? And he's still
wearing a badge?

642
00:56:51,756 --> 00:56:55,658
That was 15 years ago when Edison
was the murder capital of America.

643
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:58,160
When our biggest industry was
the production of crystal meth

644
00:56:58,263 --> 00:57:03,291
and when drive-bys were a sport.
That was before you came back.

645
00:57:08,807 --> 00:57:11,708
Did you see Deed give a girl
an engagement ring?

646
00:57:11,810 --> 00:57:14,608
Yeah.
Why is that important?

647
00:57:14,813 --> 00:57:17,304
No member of FRAT's
ever been married.

648
00:57:18,016 --> 00:57:19,210
So?

649
00:57:19,317 --> 00:57:22,115
It may be the only hook
we have to hang our hat on.

650
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:24,915
- Isiaha Charles can
- Charles's dead.

651
00:57:25,023 --> 00:57:27,423
- What?
- He was knifed in prison.

652
00:57:32,130 --> 00:57:33,927
Jesus Christ.

653
00:57:35,834 --> 00:57:37,734
Your work ever ruin a life?

654
00:57:41,639 --> 00:57:43,129
Did it?

655
00:57:43,341 --> 00:57:47,539
You do this job right you'll
ruin lives, celebrate murderers.

656
00:57:48,046 --> 00:57:50,640
They'll give you
a Pulitzer Prize for it.

657
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:54,548
I need you to reach out to Deed.

658
00:57:58,156 --> 00:58:01,956
Look, you don't have
to do this with your life.

659
00:58:02,393 --> 00:58:05,885
But if you're going to,
now is when you decide.

660
00:58:18,309 --> 00:58:19,606
- Who Is this?
- It's Pollak.

661
00:58:19,711 --> 00:58:21,008
What the fuck do you want it?

662
00:58:21,112 --> 00:58:22,704
Meet me at Blunts.

663
00:58:39,931 --> 00:58:42,422
Damn, Francis,
you are outta control.

664
00:58:43,234 --> 00:58:44,826
You are outta control, Francis.

665
00:58:44,936 --> 00:58:47,837
I thought you said you
wanted fear of God put in this guy.

666
00:58:47,939 --> 00:58:50,430
So you thought that extended
to his girlfriend?

667
00:58:50,542 --> 00:58:51,338
I just thought.

668
00:58:51,442 --> 00:58:55,538
No, you didn't think.
You acted on impulse.

669
00:58:56,948 --> 00:59:01,442
I've had to preach to a spouse,
but only after due consideration.

670
00:59:01,553 --> 00:59:03,282
Do consideration.

671
00:59:03,388 --> 00:59:06,789
You enlisted Marilyn, Wu and you
went to that hospital on impulse!

672
00:59:06,891 --> 00:59:08,381
And now this!

673
00:59:08,593 --> 00:59:10,288
The fuckin' punk was
writin' a story about me.

674
00:59:10,395 --> 00:59:12,693
There is no story, Francis!

675
00:59:13,097 --> 00:59:17,796
It's a bunch of allegations made
by a convicted felon who is dead.

676
00:59:18,303 --> 00:59:19,600
And that's where it
woulda stayed had you

677
00:59:19,704 --> 00:59:23,196
not dragged it to the front door
of Lee Wallace's family farm.

678
00:59:23,308 --> 00:59:27,404
Instead of a kid makin' his first foray
into the world of journalism.

679
00:59:27,512 --> 00:59:32,108
I got a seasoned investigator
up my ass probing FRAT business.

680
00:59:32,817 --> 00:59:35,718
This is gonna require
all my attention.

681
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:38,821
Until it's resolved,
you're desk-bound.

682
00:59:50,234 --> 00:59:52,429
You're takin' Wallace's side?

683
00:59:53,438 --> 00:59:54,029
No.

684
00:59:54,138 --> 00:59:55,935
He's a fuckin' poser.

685
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:59,237
Rodeo clown with Santa Fe
string tie bullshit.

686
00:59:59,344 --> 01:00:03,440
Gimme a break. I've done everything
you asked me to do.

687
01:00:03,548 --> 01:00:05,038
Yes.

688
01:00:07,151 --> 01:00:10,552
He pissed on the idea
of FRAT since the beginning.

689
01:00:10,655 --> 01:00:11,849
That's politics.

690
01:00:11,956 --> 01:00:14,254
15 fuckin' years
I'm on the streets.

691
01:00:14,359 --> 01:00:16,350
Gettin' rid of the cancer
that was killin' this town!

692
01:00:16,461 --> 01:00:19,658
Fifteen years ago, Edison
needed brute force to survive.

693
01:00:19,764 --> 01:00:23,860
Now, it needs finesse,
hardly your strong suit!

694
01:00:23,968 --> 01:00:25,560
I've done everything.

695
01:00:26,771 --> 01:00:30,468
Every fuckin' thing
that you asked me to do.

696
01:00:30,575 --> 01:00:31,974
Yes.

697
01:00:32,076 --> 01:00:33,373
And now what?

698
01:00:33,478 --> 01:00:35,275
You're gonna throw me
in the fuckin' garbage?

699
01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:39,282
I'm on your side.
Let's just go get in the car.

700
01:00:39,684 --> 01:00:42,881
It's not fuckin' right
you takin' his side.

701
01:00:42,987 --> 01:00:43,976
I'm on your side.

702
01:00:44,088 --> 01:00:48,286
It's not right you takin' his side.

703
01:00:48,393 --> 01:00:48,984
I'm not...

704
01:00:49,093 --> 01:00:52,893
It's not fuckin' right
you takin' his side!

705
01:00:53,798 --> 01:00:55,891
It's not fuckin' right!

706
01:01:03,941 --> 01:01:05,431
Francis.

707
01:01:06,744 --> 01:01:08,735
You're my guy,
you're number one with me.

708
01:01:08,846 --> 01:01:12,543
Since day one.
What are you doin'?

709
01:01:12,750 --> 01:01:14,741
You're my guy okay?

710
01:01:15,253 --> 01:01:18,154
Let's get in the car
and get the fuck outta here.

711
01:01:20,758 --> 01:01:21,952
Straight up?

712
01:01:22,060 --> 01:01:23,652
That's no bullshit.

713
01:01:26,164 --> 01:01:28,564
Let's just go get in the car,
all right?

714
01:01:29,067 --> 01:01:30,557
And cut the shit.

715
01:01:33,771 --> 01:01:38,174
- Let's get in the car.
- I'm sorry. I just need to sleep.

716
01:01:41,879 --> 01:01:43,369
Yeah.

717
01:02:04,936 --> 01:02:06,528
Smooth operator.

718
01:02:08,239 --> 01:02:09,433
I'm in the book.

719
01:02:09,540 --> 01:02:10,734
Your line
may be tapped.

720
01:02:10,842 --> 01:02:11,536
Are you?

721
01:02:11,642 --> 01:02:12,734
No.

722
01:02:14,545 --> 01:02:16,137
I'm not wired.

723
01:02:18,049 --> 01:02:19,346
You're shakin'.

724
01:02:19,450 --> 01:02:21,042
Well I'm scared shitless.

725
01:02:23,154 --> 01:02:25,349
I didn't do that to you.

726
01:02:27,759 --> 01:02:29,351
Now where are they?

727
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:30,552
Down the street.

728
01:02:30,661 --> 01:02:32,253
And who are they?

729
01:02:50,982 --> 01:02:52,677
You should teach.

730
01:02:55,286 --> 01:02:56,480
What?

731
01:02:57,488 --> 01:02:59,683
You said you needed a woman

732
01:02:59,791 --> 01:03:01,088
The only guys your age I know...

733
01:03:01,192 --> 01:03:03,922
havin' sex regularly
are college professors.

734
01:03:13,237 --> 01:03:14,932
This is who I am.

735
01:03:17,742 --> 01:03:19,642
When's it hit the paper?

736
01:03:21,746 --> 01:03:25,648
An officer of the court
wants to believe this story.

737
01:03:26,450 --> 01:03:30,250
An aberration in a life that
has a chance of having value.

738
01:03:30,655 --> 01:03:32,850
Man, my life is over.

739
01:03:33,357 --> 01:03:34,346
- Come on.
- What?

740
01:03:34,458 --> 01:03:35,948
Let's go on back.

741
01:03:37,662 --> 01:03:40,961
Sit down.
Have a seat.

742
01:03:48,472 --> 01:03:49,666
Let's go.

743
01:03:52,877 --> 01:03:55,471
What do you mean
your life is over?

744
01:03:55,580 --> 01:03:57,878
You have a beautiful fianc.

745
01:03:58,983 --> 01:04:00,075
Yeah.

746
01:04:02,420 --> 01:04:04,911
So you'd walk
from that for prison?

747
01:04:06,123 --> 01:04:08,921
I'm not seein'
a lotta options.

748
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:11,718
The guys out there...

749
01:04:11,829 --> 01:04:15,731
they think you got caught up in
this before you knew what it was.

750
01:04:19,437 --> 01:04:20,836
I knew.

751
01:04:21,939 --> 01:04:24,032
They think you
can get immunity.

752
01:04:24,141 --> 01:04:26,939
They want you to tell your
story to a superior court judge.

753
01:04:27,044 --> 01:04:30,036
Force Reigert and Tilman to resign.

754
01:04:30,147 --> 01:04:32,240
Edison'll clean up its own mess.

755
01:04:32,350 --> 01:04:35,547
You think the
court's not involved?

756
01:04:35,653 --> 01:04:38,144
Un-fucking-believable.

757
01:04:39,056 --> 01:04:41,854
Is anybody not
corrupt in this town?

758
01:04:41,959 --> 01:04:43,654
I don't know... you?

759
01:04:47,965 --> 01:04:50,559
If it goes to justice...

760
01:04:50,668 --> 01:04:53,159
- be the guy to take it.
- Why?

761
01:04:54,872 --> 01:04:57,272
Well I thought you were in love.

762
01:04:58,276 --> 01:05:00,176
She can do better.

763
01:05:00,978 --> 01:05:02,502
Can you?

764
01:05:12,223 --> 01:05:15,215
I was studyin' plumbin'
when you called.

765
01:05:16,928 --> 01:05:19,829
- I mean...
- Nice.

766
01:05:20,932 --> 01:05:24,527
You know, I like to
think about that

767
01:05:24,635 --> 01:05:29,436
comin' home to Maria
huggin' my children.

768
01:05:29,540 --> 01:05:32,134
Just livin' a normal life.

769
01:05:39,150 --> 01:05:40,549
Wha's up?

770
01:05:43,220 --> 01:05:48,658
What happened to her.

771
01:05:51,162 --> 01:05:54,563
- She didn't deserve this.
- You're right.

772
01:06:30,835 --> 01:06:33,030
It was a righteous offer.

773
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:38,635
This is gonna get ugly.

774
01:06:54,058 --> 01:06:56,458
No, no.
Let him go.

775
01:08:19,110 --> 01:08:21,908
Just got a call
from Hanson at FBI.

776
01:08:22,012 --> 01:08:25,311
Justice is setting
up a task force.

777
01:08:25,416 --> 01:08:27,714
Sturm und drang.

778
01:08:27,818 --> 01:08:32,312
If they had anything, they'd be
arresting, not searching.

779
01:08:32,623 --> 01:08:34,022
And will they find anything?

780
01:08:34,125 --> 01:08:37,117
- This isn't connected to you.
- You're connected to me.

781
01:08:37,228 --> 01:08:39,526
And you're under a microscope.

782
01:08:39,630 --> 01:08:43,828
Because of your...
your reckless behavior.

783
01:08:43,934 --> 01:08:46,835
The girl's picture will
be everywhere tomorrow.

784
01:08:46,937 --> 01:08:48,837
Wallace and Ashford
already know somethin's up.

785
01:08:48,939 --> 01:08:51,339
If that kid's article
links me and Better Edison to

786
01:08:51,442 --> 01:08:55,139
I am the reason that
this city is what it is.

787
01:08:55,246 --> 01:08:58,545
This? This doesn't
get near to you.

788
01:08:58,649 --> 01:09:02,676
Yeah well...
I wish I had your certainty.

789
01:09:07,691 --> 01:09:09,386
FBI.
This is a Federal warrant.

790
01:09:09,493 --> 01:09:12,394
We're taking all
FRAT evidence files.

791
01:09:29,013 --> 01:09:30,810
In my office.

792
01:09:41,825 --> 01:09:45,727
They have impounded your car.
Or what's left of it.

793
01:09:45,829 --> 01:09:48,730
Anything that you need to
tell me right now, Laz?

794
01:09:50,634 --> 01:09:52,329
No, Captain.

795
01:09:52,436 --> 01:09:55,837
Sit on it then,
till O-one hundred.

796
01:09:58,042 --> 01:09:59,236
Go.

797
01:10:02,046 --> 01:10:03,741
Goddamn phones everywhere.

798
01:10:03,847 --> 01:10:05,439
Fuckin' yid from the Herald.

799
01:10:05,549 --> 01:10:08,643
- You don't know that.
- Bullshit. He was makin' noise.

800
01:10:08,752 --> 01:10:09,548
And you

801
01:10:09,653 --> 01:10:13,248
with your Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
beggin' to be looked at.

802
01:10:13,357 --> 01:10:15,655
You say anything to Maria?

803
01:10:15,759 --> 01:10:19,251
You flap your lips and
she could come to Jesus, too.

804
01:11:27,264 --> 01:11:30,062
Get his keys.

805
01:11:30,167 --> 01:11:32,362
And call nine-one-one.

806
01:11:58,395 --> 01:12:00,090
Tilman shot Lazerov.

807
01:12:00,197 --> 01:12:01,892
Lazerov's dead.

808
01:12:01,999 --> 01:12:05,935
Apparently Lazerov attempted
to shoot Deed. Tilman intervened.

809
01:12:06,036 --> 01:12:08,436
Well Tilman just served up.

810
01:12:08,539 --> 01:12:09,733
Dammit.

811
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:11,330
Come on.
No, wait, Lee.

812
01:12:11,442 --> 01:12:13,239
- What's the point, Moe?
- Wait a minute.

813
01:12:13,344 --> 01:12:15,335
Forget it, Moe!
Forget the whole thing.

814
01:12:15,446 --> 01:12:16,538
This isn't going anywhere.

815
01:12:16,647 --> 01:12:17,944
Bullshit.

816
01:12:18,048 --> 01:12:21,245
- Pollack!
- This shit isn't over.

817
01:12:21,552 --> 01:12:22,246
What are you doing?

818
01:12:22,353 --> 01:12:24,947
Isiaha's dead.
Willow's in a fucking coma?

819
01:12:25,055 --> 01:12:26,352
I'll publish myself

820
01:12:26,457 --> 01:12:30,154
if I have to copy it at Kinko's
and pass it out on the street corner.

821
01:12:32,262 --> 01:12:36,062
It's a fucking disaster.
A fucking disaster!!

822
01:12:36,467 --> 01:12:39,664
We were on the short list
for the Republican Convention.

823
01:12:39,770 --> 01:12:42,466
The summer fucking Olympics!!

824
01:12:42,673 --> 01:12:45,665
And now we're look at
a Federal consent decree?

825
01:12:45,776 --> 01:12:49,872
There's a dead body
outside my fucking office!!

826
01:12:49,980 --> 01:12:52,574
The fuck are we gonna do?

827
01:12:52,683 --> 01:12:56,175
It kinda puts a little crimp in your
Better Edison thing, doesn't it?

828
01:12:56,286 --> 01:12:57,776
We gotta do something
about him, Lee.

829
01:12:57,888 --> 01:12:58,877
Who, Tilman?

830
01:12:58,989 --> 01:13:02,425
Well... there it is.
You know. Yeah.

831
01:13:02,526 --> 01:13:04,517
What about you, Jack?

832
01:13:04,628 --> 01:13:06,118
Huh? Me?

833
01:13:06,230 --> 01:13:08,630
Yeah you.

834
01:13:11,735 --> 01:13:14,932
What are we gonna do about you?

835
01:13:15,038 --> 01:13:20,340
Well... I'll be fine.
Thanks for asking.

836
01:14:20,337 --> 01:14:22,737
All units... All units
please respond.

837
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:25,240
We have a five-twelve
at 6th and Main.

838
01:14:25,342 --> 01:14:27,742
All units.
All units please respond.

839
01:14:27,845 --> 01:14:30,541
We have a five-twelve at 6th and
Main.

840
01:14:30,647 --> 01:14:33,741
Copy that dispatch.
This is two-six responding.

841
01:14:44,261 --> 01:14:45,159
Hello?

842
01:14:45,262 --> 01:14:48,459
It's me. Meet me at the courthouse
tomorrow morning at nine.

843
01:14:48,565 --> 01:14:50,157
Rafe please talk

844
01:14:50,968 --> 01:14:52,959
Hello? Rafe?

845
01:15:06,216 --> 01:15:07,410
Josh?

846
01:15:08,619 --> 01:15:12,020
- Maria?
- Yeah. Green. Hi.

847
01:15:12,122 --> 01:15:16,422
Thank you for helping Raphael get
over his fear of doing this.

848
01:15:18,228 --> 01:15:19,320
I'm Hector, Maria's father.

849
01:15:19,429 --> 01:15:20,726
- Hi.
- Yeah.

850
01:15:20,831 --> 01:15:21,525
Where's Rafe?

851
01:15:21,632 --> 01:15:23,827
He's changing in
the men's room. Yeah.

852
01:15:23,934 --> 01:15:25,629
- Okay.
- Okay.

853
01:15:28,739 --> 01:15:29,933
Rafe?

854
01:15:30,741 --> 01:15:31,639
Rafe?

855
01:15:31,742 --> 01:15:33,437
Yeah, I'm out here!

856
01:15:42,252 --> 01:15:44,049
What's goin' on, man?

857
01:15:47,057 --> 01:15:48,649
What are ya doin'?

858
01:15:53,063 --> 01:15:54,758
It's crazy, man.

859
01:15:55,065 --> 01:15:56,760
Tilman shot.

860
01:15:56,867 --> 01:15:57,765
Yeah, I know.

861
01:15:57,868 --> 01:16:00,860
And your first reaction
is 'let's get married'?

862
01:16:00,971 --> 01:16:02,302
It's what she wants.

863
01:16:02,406 --> 01:16:04,101
That's her.

864
01:16:04,207 --> 01:16:06,607
Hey, why are you doin' it?

865
01:16:07,411 --> 01:16:09,003
Death benefits.

866
01:16:14,117 --> 01:16:15,607
What' this?

867
01:16:15,719 --> 01:16:17,619
It's the rest of your story.

868
01:16:20,524 --> 01:16:22,515
Are you sure?

869
01:16:22,626 --> 01:16:24,218
Am I sure of what?

870
01:16:24,328 --> 01:16:28,025
Are you sure you want this,
and I want you to think about it.

871
01:16:28,131 --> 01:16:32,124
Something goes wrong your
whole world comes crashin' down.

872
01:16:32,235 --> 01:16:34,226
And mine, too.

873
01:16:37,140 --> 01:16:38,937
What do you think?

874
01:16:40,844 --> 01:16:43,540
I say write your fuckin' story.

875
01:16:45,849 --> 01:16:47,840
Thank you.

876
01:16:47,951 --> 01:16:49,543
Just remember.

877
01:16:50,954 --> 01:16:55,857
These guys don't fuck around.

878
01:16:56,159 --> 01:16:58,059
They're relentless.

879
01:16:59,663 --> 01:17:00,857
Keep your head down.

880
01:17:00,964 --> 01:17:02,397
And your door locked.

881
01:17:02,499 --> 01:17:03,591
Thank you.

882
01:17:07,004 --> 01:17:10,599
Come on, I gotta get married,
come on. Let's get out.

883
01:17:54,651 --> 01:17:56,551
Rafe. Come in.

884
01:17:56,653 --> 01:17:58,450
- Hey, Rafe.
- Wha's up, man?

885
01:17:58,555 --> 01:18:01,547
Rafe. Sit down.

886
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,594
This is a police file photo
Pollack's girlfriend

887
01:18:12,703 --> 01:18:15,194
at the Lazerov's come to
Jesus talk.

888
01:18:17,708 --> 01:18:22,509
And there it is. The enemy
you can't beat a photograph.

889
01:18:22,612 --> 01:18:26,104
Ashford's printing this as
a tease to polics story on FRAT.

890
01:18:26,216 --> 01:18:29,413
So we say Charles is a liar.

891
01:18:29,519 --> 01:18:32,716
He'd say anything to go home
and visit his dying mother, right?

892
01:18:32,823 --> 01:18:34,518
Whatever discrepancies
there are between

893
01:18:34,624 --> 01:18:36,819
his testimony and what's
actually in the police locker

894
01:18:36,927 --> 01:18:41,227
will be offset when the Feds find the
drugs we planted in 's house.

895
01:18:41,331 --> 01:18:44,129
You rammed the door
to compromise its security.

896
01:18:44,234 --> 01:18:48,534
Keep the junkies from using
the place as a shooting gallery.

897
01:18:48,638 --> 01:18:51,334
Lazerov was unstable.

898
01:18:51,441 --> 01:18:53,136
So the Feds' will buy that.

899
01:18:53,243 --> 01:18:55,234
All that's left is Pollack.

900
01:18:57,347 --> 01:18:58,541
Pollack?

901
01:19:04,387 --> 01:19:05,684
He's a kid.

902
01:19:09,793 --> 01:19:14,492
Justice needs the case closed.

903
01:19:14,598 --> 01:19:16,896
So we give 'em.

904
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:20,299
Herald needs its advertisers,
I can handle that.

905
01:19:20,403 --> 01:19:22,598
But this kid Pollack?

906
01:19:22,806 --> 01:19:26,401
This kid polic is
like a pup with a bone.

907
01:19:26,510 --> 01:19:27,807
He doesn't wanna hear
there's no meat on it,

908
01:19:27,911 --> 01:19:30,903
he just keeps gnawin'
and gnawin' and gnawin'.

909
01:19:31,715 --> 01:19:32,807
So...

910
01:19:34,918 --> 01:19:37,512
Polic has to see the man.

911
01:19:44,528 --> 01:19:46,428
It's a partner's duty.

912
01:19:50,233 --> 01:19:52,428
To Laz?

913
01:19:52,536 --> 01:19:55,528
To Laz.

914
01:20:13,056 --> 01:20:14,148
What?!

915
01:20:14,758 --> 01:20:16,658
What? What?

916
01:20:16,760 --> 01:20:18,751
You know what.

917
01:20:18,862 --> 01:20:20,659
You know exactly what.

918
01:20:20,764 --> 01:20:22,561
You're the only one
that can put an end to this now.

919
01:20:22,666 --> 01:20:25,066
I go to Justice, what I'm dealing
with threatens the people I love.

920
01:20:25,168 --> 01:20:26,157
What's the matter with you?

921
01:20:26,269 --> 01:20:27,258
You're havin' an
argument with yourself.

922
01:20:27,370 --> 01:20:30,066
- Don't talk to me like I was
- I said It was a righteous offer...

923
01:20:30,173 --> 01:20:31,071
but I'm not takin' it.

924
01:20:31,174 --> 01:20:32,869
You're not listening.

925
01:20:37,581 --> 01:20:40,482
I'm not talkin' about my offer.

926
01:20:40,584 --> 01:20:42,484
I didn't say go to Justice.

927
01:20:42,586 --> 01:20:47,990
I said you're the only one who can
put an end to this. Didn't I?

928
01:20:48,091 --> 01:20:49,683
Yes you did

929
01:20:54,297 --> 01:20:55,992
Yes you did.

930
01:21:15,151 --> 01:21:17,949
Hello, you've reached the
answering machine for...

931
01:21:18,054 --> 01:21:19,351
Moses Ashford.

932
01:21:19,456 --> 01:21:22,050
Please leave a message at the tone.

933
01:21:22,659 --> 01:21:25,753
Hey, it's Josh.
You're not gonna believe this.

934
01:21:25,862 --> 01:21:28,763
I just got a hold of
the evidence we need on FRAT.

935
01:21:28,865 --> 01:21:31,766
Listen, I don't wanna talk
over the phone, but

936
01:21:31,868 --> 01:21:34,166
Moses, you're gonna
wanna see this.

937
01:21:34,271 --> 01:21:37,172
I'm layin' out the story now
and then I'll email it to you.

938
01:21:37,274 --> 01:21:40,971
Oh, and I'm also Fed-Ex'ing
hardcopies to all the big papers.

939
01:21:41,077 --> 01:21:42,567
I'll talk to you later.

940
01:22:06,336 --> 01:22:07,928
You've got email.

941
01:23:22,445 --> 01:23:24,345
Right.

942
01:23:24,447 --> 01:23:25,937
Yes, I know.

943
01:23:26,349 --> 01:23:30,251
Yeah, I emailed it last night
but I'll mail a hardcopy to be safe...

944
01:23:30,353 --> 01:23:33,254
so let me get your
address right now.

945
01:23:37,460 --> 01:23:40,861
Okay, right,
perfect

946
01:23:40,964 --> 01:23:43,558
Okay, it's on its way.
Thank you. Bye-bye.

947
01:24:07,223 --> 01:24:08,713
Fuck.

948
01:24:38,655 --> 01:24:39,849
What're you doing?

949
01:24:44,461 --> 01:24:45,553
In the car!

950
01:24:45,962 --> 01:24:47,953
In the car!
Move! Get in!

951
01:25:10,019 --> 01:25:11,008
Oh my god.

952
01:25:14,124 --> 01:25:15,113
Shit!

953
01:25:21,030 --> 01:25:21,826
Fuck!

954
01:25:33,243 --> 01:25:34,232
Fuck.

955
01:25:37,447 --> 01:25:39,039
We're gonna fuckin' die.

956
01:25:46,756 --> 01:25:47,654
Move it!

957
01:25:48,158 --> 01:25:48,954
Go!

958
01:25:51,561 --> 01:25:52,858
Open fire!

959
01:25:55,365 --> 01:25:57,265
- Go! Go! Go!
- What?

960
01:25:57,867 --> 01:25:59,357
Go! Go!

961
01:26:10,413 --> 01:26:12,404
Go to the warehouse!

962
01:27:16,312 --> 01:27:17,301
Look out!

963
01:28:15,505 --> 01:28:17,200
Fuck!
Fuck!

964
01:28:19,208 --> 01:28:20,197
Jeez

965
01:28:20,410 --> 01:28:21,707
Hold your fire!

966
01:28:27,116 --> 01:28:28,606
You hear me Deed?

967
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:34,217
Let's stop all this alright?
We don't have to do this.

968
01:28:34,324 --> 01:28:35,814
All I want is the kid.

969
01:28:35,925 --> 01:28:38,120
You hear me?
All I want is that kid.

970
01:28:38,227 --> 01:28:42,721
Tell him whatever
it is, you won

971
01:28:44,133 --> 01:28:48,126
and we can come to an extremely
agreeable solution here.

972
01:28:48,237 --> 01:28:51,035
Same deal you gave Lazerov?

973
01:28:51,140 --> 01:28:53,233
Motherfucker.

974
01:28:55,044 --> 01:28:58,138
The fuck is wrong with you!

975
01:28:58,247 --> 01:29:00,044
Let's finish this thing.

976
01:29:08,391 --> 01:29:10,484
You go.
I'll light this up!

977
01:29:11,694 --> 01:29:13,594
Move! Move!

978
01:29:33,716 --> 01:29:35,115
Drop 'em.

979
01:29:35,318 --> 01:29:37,718
Get up.
Get up.

980
01:29:41,524 --> 01:29:42,718
He's down!

981
01:29:48,231 --> 01:29:50,825
Hey Rafe!
Come on out now.

982
01:29:50,933 --> 01:29:52,628
It's over!
I got your boy here.

983
01:29:52,735 --> 01:29:57,434
Come on, Rafe. Get out where
I can see you, Rafe.

984
01:29:57,540 --> 01:30:01,533
I'll kill him now
I don't see you!

985
01:30:01,644 --> 01:30:03,134
Get out a here!

986
01:30:08,151 --> 01:30:11,348
We're finished.
It's over we're done.

987
01:30:11,554 --> 01:30:13,545
You're goddamn right it's over.

988
01:30:13,656 --> 01:30:16,955
- Put It down.
- FRAT's over.

989
01:30:18,060 --> 01:30:19,755
Everybody's dead.

990
01:30:19,862 --> 01:30:21,955
Everybody's dead because of you!

991
01:30:22,064 --> 01:30:25,261
Because you couldn't do
what you were supposed to do.

992
01:30:25,368 --> 01:30:28,769
Put a bullet in this
fucker and his story.

993
01:30:28,871 --> 01:30:31,271
Well you do it now, Rafe.

994
01:30:32,575 --> 01:30:36,773
Put a bullet in his fuckin' head.
Do what I tell you.

995
01:30:36,879 --> 01:30:40,576
We walk away,
forget about this shit.

996
01:30:40,683 --> 01:30:41,581
You kill him.

997
01:30:41,684 --> 01:30:43,584
Right now you do
as you're told.

998
01:30:43,686 --> 01:30:48,282
Do it!
You do it!

999
01:30:48,391 --> 01:30:51,690
Because if you don't, I will.

1000
01:30:54,297 --> 01:30:55,389
- Duck.
- What?

1001
01:31:14,951 --> 01:31:16,851
Keep your door
locked, kid

1002
01:31:46,182 --> 01:31:47,672
Now not for another 15 minutes.

1003
01:31:47,783 --> 01:31:49,876
Don't say anything.
I'll be there in a minute.

1004
01:31:51,287 --> 01:31:53,084
Where have you been?

1005
01:31:53,189 --> 01:31:54,884
Laying out Polllack's story.

1006
01:31:54,991 --> 01:31:58,688
Yeah, well, the story changed.

1007
01:32:02,231 --> 01:32:03,721
And Deed wasn't here.

1008
01:32:03,833 --> 01:32:06,927
Detective Wallace.
D.A. Reigert's here.

1009
01:32:15,344 --> 01:32:16,538
Tilman?

1010
01:32:33,663 --> 01:32:35,460
Why are they here?

1011
01:32:36,265 --> 01:32:37,664
They're reporters.

1012
01:32:37,767 --> 01:32:39,359
The press is on the other side.

1013
01:32:39,468 --> 01:32:42,960
And material witnesses
to the dissension in FRAT.

1014
01:32:43,072 --> 01:32:44,266
Right.

1015
01:32:44,373 --> 01:32:46,773
Not much for the FBI
to work with, is there?

1016
01:32:46,876 --> 01:32:49,174
No they'll probably
close up shop.

1017
01:32:56,686 --> 01:32:58,677
This kind of story...

1018
01:32:59,589 --> 01:33:04,526
not really in the Herald's
wheelhouse, is it Moses?

1019
01:33:04,627 --> 01:33:06,424
No it's not.

1020
01:33:06,529 --> 01:33:08,121
No.

1021
01:33:12,735 --> 01:33:15,329
Tilman have any last words?

1022
01:33:19,642 --> 01:33:23,942
Well, there it is.
Good day, gentlemen.

1023
01:33:24,146 --> 01:33:27,240
He said there was agreement
between the D.A. 's office...

1024
01:33:27,350 --> 01:33:31,446
and judges regarding
FRAT related prosecutions.

1025
01:33:31,554 --> 01:33:34,352
That the cash evidence from
criminal trials wound up in the

1026
01:33:34,457 --> 01:33:39,053
Better Edison Foundation
for your political campaign.

1027
01:33:39,161 --> 01:33:42,858
That laundering this
money was systematic.

1028
01:33:42,965 --> 01:33:45,365
That principals from
Midland, Hightower

1029
01:33:45,468 --> 01:33:48,665
and other companies
were involved.

1030
01:33:49,572 --> 01:33:51,369
He said all that?

1031
01:33:56,579 --> 01:33:59,173
And that was
unmitigated slander.

1032
01:33:59,281 --> 01:34:00,578
I'm gonna go with it

1033
01:34:00,683 --> 01:34:05,017
if you run for any elected or
appointed office in this state.

1034
01:34:05,721 --> 01:34:09,919
Broke as you are, you think
that's a smart thing to do?

1035
01:34:10,026 --> 01:34:15,225
Now, Jack, did I get broke
doin' the smart thing?

1036
01:34:33,349 --> 01:34:36,944
In the night, when no
reporters were around to cover it

1037
01:34:37,053 --> 01:34:40,045
Wallace removed all
evidence of Better Edison.

1038
01:34:43,359 --> 01:34:45,350
Will are recovered.

1039
01:34:45,461 --> 01:34:48,760
Indeed, he got into
another line of work.

1040
01:34:48,864 --> 01:34:52,664
It would have violated a sacred
trust to turn him in to the law.

1041
01:34:52,768 --> 01:34:55,066
And the law already knew.

1042
01:34:55,171 --> 01:34:57,867
Justice is a lot
like journalism.

1043
01:34:59,175 --> 01:35:02,110
Sometimes the most
important questions

1044
01:35:02,211 --> 01:35:05,112
are the ones you
decide not to ask.
