9
00:01:11,156 --> 00:01:12,885
It's beautiful.

10
00:01:12,957 --> 00:01:14,857
I think it's going to
better than last year.

11
00:01:14,926 --> 00:01:18,089
I want to finish it today
so that I can practice in it.

12
00:01:18,163 --> 00:01:20,028
Good idea.

13

15
00:01:26,371 --> 00:01:27,804
Me neither.

00:02:38,109 --> 00:02:42,102
<i>Hey Sam, you ready to
bring home the title?</i>

19
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,511
He's a dancer,
not a fighter.

<i>Did you hear about
Verwoerd's new policy?</i>

21

Policy?

22
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:51,946
It's on the wireless.

23
00:02:52,023 --> 00:02:55,618
Hendrik Verwoerd wants to give
our children Bantu education

24
00:02:55,693 --> 00:02:59,857
<i>so they'll never be more than
kitchen boys and street sweepers.</i>

<i>Hey, Williel</i>

27
00:03:31,396 --> 00:03:35,890
<i>What about you, Willie?
You ready for the big day?</i>

28
00:03:35,967 --> 00:03:38,333
Hey Willie, I know one
of the ballroom judges.

29
00:03:38,403 --> 00:03:39,563
He's from
Motherwell Township.

30
00:03:39,637 --> 00:03:41,400
Does he drink whiskey?

31
00:03:41,472 --> 00:03:43,337
Maybe you can take him a case, Willie.

32
00:03:43,408 --> 00:03:45,376
Haaikona, gents.

33
00:03:45,443 --> 00:03:47,240
<i>New Brighton must win
this one fair and square.</i>

34
00:03:47,312 --> 00:03:49,542
Then we can't
rely on Willie.

35
00:04:10,335 --> 00:04:13,702
Don't worry
about that one.

36
00:04:13,771 --> 00:04:16,706
Willie, just remember
what I told you,

37
00:04:16,774 --> 00:04:19,208
the secret is to make it look easy.

38
00:04:19,277 --> 00:04:21,108
Ballroom must look happy.

39
00:04:21,179 --> 00:04:24,945
Like, like romance.

40
00:04:25,016 --> 00:04:27,712
I've got no romance left
for Hilda anymore, Boet Sam.

41
00:04:27,785 --> 00:04:32,586
Then pretend. I magine
Hilda is Ginger Rogers.

42
00:04:32,657 --> 00:04:36,218
With no teeth?
You try.

43

Okay. Where's
my kiss?

54
00:05:16,334 --> 00:05:20,498
Ah, you're not
even dressed.

55
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:24,007
Bye, Hally. Have

00:07:18,022 --> 00:07:19,512
Ja.

65

Yes, Boss.

68
00:07:35,873 --> 00:07:36,771
That's a Basutu name.

69
00:07:36,841 --> 00:07:38,570
Yes, Boss.

70
00:07:38,643 --> 00:07:40,634
So what are you doing here

71
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:42,338
Working, Boss.
I've got Section 10.

72
00:07:42,413 --> 00:07:47,783

the back, Boss.

73
00:07:47,852 --> 00:07:49,183
Okay.

74

<i>Hey,

76
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:03,157
Whoa!

77
00:08:03,234 --> 00:08:04,929

<i>Aren't you having
another drink, Harry?</i>

84
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:37,026

<i>Oh, yeah, I'm sure he wasn't.</i>

86

How do you spell gimp?

87

Lost his legs in the
Great War, huh, Hally?

88
00:08:45,943 --> 00:08:46,932
Yeah.

89
00:08:47,011 --> 00:08:48,638
Stupid cripple.

90

Hilda Samuels
is a bitch!

92
00:08:52,383 --> 00:08:54,374
Three nights now she
doesn't come practice.

93
00:08:54,452 --> 00:08:58,320
I wind up gramophone, I get
record ready, and I sit and wait.

94
00:08:58,389 --> 00:09:00,482
Ten o'clock I start
dancing with my pillow.

95
00:09:00,558 --> 00:09:02,219
How's your pillow
with the quickstep?

96
00:09:02,293 --> 00:09:04,022
Good! And why?

97
00:09:04,095 --> 00:09:05,722
Because she's got no legs.
That's her trouble.

98
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:08,230
She can't move
them quick enough.

99
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:10,199
Struesgod, she doesn't
come tonight

100
00:09:10,267 --> 00:09:12,258
I take back my dress,
my ballroom shoes

101

Ja, and now she's making trouble
for me with the baby again.

105
00:09:20,645 --> 00:09:22,442
Reports me to child welfare,

106

Every week I am giving
her money for milk.

110
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,581
And how do I know
its my baby?

111
00:09:31,656 --> 00:09:34,420
Only his hair
look like me.

112
00:09:34,492 --> 00:09:35,857

00:13:49,413 --> 00:13:53,281
<i># She took my money
She called me honey #</i>

163
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:58,287
<i># She called this love
She was playin' a game ##</i>

164
00:14:01,859 --> 00:14:04,521
Alright.
Oh.

165
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:17,539
Hey, Boet Sam,
I'm getting it.

166
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:18,870
The quickstep!

167
00:14:18,943 --> 00:14:20,706
Look now
and tell me.

168
00:14:20,778 --> 00:14:22,040
Show me again.

169
00:14:22,112 --> 00:14:23,204
Oount for me.

170
00:14:24,381 --> 00:14:25,541
Ready?

171
00:14:25,616 --> 00:14:26,981
Ready.

172
00:14:27,051 --> 00:14:29,383
And five, six,
seven, eight

173
00:14:29,453 --> 00:14:32,047
And one, two,
three, four

174
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:33,817
five, six,
seven, eight...

175
00:14:33,891 --> 00:14:35,620
Your shoulders!

176
00:14:35,693 --> 00:14:37,627
<i>Two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight</i>

177
00:14:37,695 --> 00:14:39,390
Don't look down, Willie!

178
00:14:39,463 --> 00:14:43,229
<i>Two, three, four, five, six...
look happy I</i>

179
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,665
<i>No, Willie, relax.</i>

180
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:46,168
I'm relaxed.

181
00:14:46,236 --> 00:14:48,067
No, you're not.
Willie, relax!

182
00:14:48,138 --> 00:14:49,230
- I am relaxed!
- Relax.

183
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:50,830
Breathe, and relax.

184
00:14:50,908 --> 00:14:52,170
Boet Sam!

185
00:14:52,242 --> 00:14:54,176
You make me
make mistakes.

186
00:14:54,244 --> 00:14:57,907
No, you are too stiff. You
must try to glide through it.

187
00:14:57,982 --> 00:14:59,176
Glide?

188
00:14:59,249 --> 00:15:01,240
Ja, give it more style.

189
00:15:01,318 --> 00:15:03,878
You must look like you
are enjoying yourself.

190
00:15:03,954 --> 00:15:05,012
I wasn't.

191
00:15:05,089 --> 00:15:06,716
Exactly.

192
00:15:15,466 --> 00:15:18,435
Willie... tell
me something.

193
00:15:18,502 --> 00:15:23,098
When did you last
give Hilda a hiding?

194
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:24,538
Sunday night.

195
00:15:24,608 --> 00:15:26,599
Aah, hiding
on Sunday night

196
00:15:26,677 --> 00:15:29,202
then Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
she doesn't come to practice.

197
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,110
And you are
asking me why.

198
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:33,274
One day she's going
to leave you for good.

199
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,784
So, she makes
me the hell in.

200
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:37,980
<i>You had the same
trouble with Eunice.</i>

201
00:15:38,055 --> 00:15:40,683
<i>Because she also made
me the hell in, Boet Sam.</i>

202
00:15:40,758 --> 00:15:42,419
<i>Willie...</i>

203
00:15:42,493 --> 00:15:45,291
She never got the steps
right, even the waltz.

204
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:49,059
Beating her up every time she
makes a mistake in the waltz

205
00:15:49,133 --> 00:15:53,126
no, Willie, that takes the
pleasure out of ballroom dancing.

206
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:17,159
Look and learn

207
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:20,162
don't worry about making
mistakes or the judges

208
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,754
or the other competitors.

209
00:16:21,832 --> 00:16:24,926
It's just you, Hilda,
and the music.

210
00:16:25,002 --> 00:16:27,334
<i>And you are going to have a good time.</i>

211
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:28,769
Okay, Sam.

212
00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:30,500
What Oount Basie
do you play?

213
00:16:30,574 --> 00:16:33,099
U m, "You the cream
on my cupcake

214
00:16:33,177 --> 00:16:34,007
you're the salt
in my soup. "

215
00:16:36,013 --> 00:16:38,140
M m-hm, right, right. Give
it to me in strict tempo.

216
00:16:38,215 --> 00:16:42,311
Okay.
Ready?

217
00:16:42,386 --> 00:16:44,820
Ready.

218
00:16:44,888 --> 00:16:49,154
<i># And you're
the cream on my cupcake #</i>

219
00:16:49,226 --> 00:16:52,024
<i># You're the salt
in my soup #</i>

220
00:16:52,096 --> 00:16:55,190
<i># You will always
be right here for me #</i>

221
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:58,132
<i># I'm a mess without
you, bam-bam I ##</i>

222
00:16:58,202 --> 00:16:59,965
Great, Boet Sam.

223
00:17:00,037 --> 00:17:03,529
Bravo. No question
about it.

224
00:17:03,607 --> 00:17:06,405
First place,
Mr. Sam Semela.

225
00:17:06,477 --> 00:17:07,466
Ohhh!

226
00:17:07,544 --> 00:17:08,704
Howzit, chaps?

227
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:10,212
Okay, Hally.

228
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,976
At your service,
Master Harold.

229
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:14,847
Not long to the
big event, hey?

230
00:17:14,918 --> 00:17:16,215
Two weeks' time.

231
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:18,277
You think you
stand a chance?

232
00:17:18,355 --> 00:17:20,880
Let's just say I'm ready to
go out there and dance. Ahhh.

233
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,550
Ahhh.

234
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:24,389
You look like it.
What about you, Willie?

235
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:25,826
He's got leg trouble.

236
00:17:25,896 --> 00:17:27,227
Boet Sam!

237
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:29,527
Ah, sorry to hear
that, Willie.

238
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,400
Oh, God, what a
lousy bloody day.

239
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,734
Bad day for business,
chaps, but...

240
00:17:35,806 --> 00:17:39,173
it leaves room for
a nice quiet afternoon.

241
00:17:39,243 --> 00:17:40,733
Ah. Where's my
mom? Shopping?

242
00:17:40,811 --> 00:17:44,247
The hospital.

243
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:46,339
But it's Thursday.

244
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:51,012
There's no visiting on Thursday
afternoons. Is Dad okay?

245
00:17:51,088 --> 00:17:53,249
I'm not sure, Halley,
the hospital phoned.

246
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:55,814
Maybe he's coming home.

247
00:17:55,893 --> 00:17:57,884
What makes you say that?

248
00:17:57,961 --> 00:18:00,259
<i>Oh, I don't know, I just
heard your mom talking.</i>

249
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,558
<i>She said
she'd phone you.</i>

250
00:18:01,632 --> 00:18:09,903
You want to eat?

251
00:18:09,973 --> 00:18:12,942
<i>Halley, do you want lunch?</i>

252
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:18,073
Ja, just soup.

253
00:18:18,148 --> 00:18:20,616
<i>Kempston?
Mental pollution.</i>

254
00:18:20,684 --> 00:18:23,619
Take them away.

255
00:18:25,289 --> 00:18:27,553
They can't be
discharging him.

256
00:18:27,624 --> 00:18:31,788
They said he'd need at least
another three weeks of treatment!

257
00:18:31,862 --> 00:18:34,558
No, Willie, Sam's
definitely made a mistake!

258
00:18:34,631 --> 00:18:35,757
H uh.

259
00:18:54,318 --> 00:18:59,153
So, Willie!

260
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:28,147
So, Willie, which
leg is sore?

261
00:19:28,218 --> 00:19:30,186
Boet Sam is only
making jokes.

262
00:19:30,254 --> 00:19:31,846
So you'll be
in the competition?

263
00:19:31,922 --> 00:19:33,981
Only if I find
myself a partner.

264
00:19:34,057 --> 00:19:35,490
What about Hilda?

265
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:37,117
She's the one
with leg trouble.

266
00:19:37,194 --> 00:19:39,025
I think the lady's
gone a bit lame.

267
00:19:39,096 --> 00:19:40,791
<i>Boet Sam I</i>

268
00:19:40,864 --> 00:19:42,695
Have you taken her
to see a doctor, Willie?

269
00:19:42,766 --> 00:19:44,256
I think a vet
would be better.

270
00:19:47,471 --> 00:19:49,996
What the hell do you
think you're doing, Willie!

271
00:19:50,073 --> 00:19:53,702
Act your bloody age!
Get on with your work.

272
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:56,337
You, too, Sam.
Stop fooling around.

273
00:19:56,413 --> 00:19:59,541
No. Hang on. Tell me
exactly what my mom said.

274
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:01,516
I have.

275
00:20:01,585 --> 00:20:03,519
"When Hally comes, tell him
I've gone to the hospital

276
00:20:03,587 --> 00:20:05,384
and I'll phone him. "

277
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:07,719
So she didn't say anything
about taking my dad home?

278
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,258
- No, it's just when she was...
- No, Sam, it's just...

279
00:20:09,326 --> 00:20:11,385
We saw him last night

280
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:13,258
and he wasn't in
good shape at all.

281
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:16,026
And now suddenly
today he's better?

282
00:20:16,099 --> 00:20:19,034
You've definitely
got it wrong.

283
00:20:19,102 --> 00:20:20,467
Okay, Hally.

284
00:20:40,957 --> 00:20:42,754
<i>Who is this supposed to be?</i>

285
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:44,555
<i>Old fart-face Prentice.</i>

286
00:20:44,628 --> 00:20:45,686
Teacher?

287
00:20:45,762 --> 00:20:46,922
He thinks
he is.

288
00:20:46,997 --> 00:20:48,430
- Has he seen it?
- Ja.

289
00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:50,932
Said I was no
Leonardo da Vinci

290
00:20:51,001 --> 00:20:52,593
and that bad art
had to be punished.

291
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:54,227
Six of the best?

292
00:20:54,304 --> 00:20:55,498
And his are bloody good.

293
00:20:55,572 --> 00:20:57,005
With your trousers down!

294
00:20:57,074 --> 00:20:58,701
No. He's not
quite that barbaric.

295
00:20:58,775 --> 00:21:03,508
Ja. That's the way
they do it in jail.

296
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,741
Really?

297
00:21:05,816 --> 00:21:10,446
Ja. When the magistrate sentences
you to "strokes with a light cane. "

298
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,044
Go on.

299
00:21:12,122 --> 00:21:16,559
Come, Willie!

300
00:21:16,626 --> 00:21:20,460
First you have
to lie on a bench

301
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:24,899
one policeman pulls your trousers
down and holds your ankles.

302
00:21:24,968 --> 00:21:27,232
<i>It's not
fair, is it, Hally?</i>

303
00:21:27,304 --> 00:21:29,295
<i>A kaffir's black ass.</i>

304
00:21:29,373 --> 00:21:30,567
<i>The other policeman pulls
your shirt over your head</i>

305
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,629
and holds your arms.

306
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:35,136
Thank you,
that's enough.

307
00:21:35,212 --> 00:21:37,908
<i>Then the one who's about
to give you the strokes...</i>

308
00:21:37,981 --> 00:21:40,245
I've heard enough, Sam!

309
00:21:40,317 --> 00:21:44,754
Jesus!

310
00:21:44,821 --> 00:21:48,188
It's a bloody awful world
when you come to think of it.

311
00:21:48,258 --> 00:21:49,589
That's the way
it is, Hally.

312
00:21:49,659 --> 00:21:52,526
Well, it doesn't
have to be.

313
00:21:52,596 --> 00:21:57,124
<i>You'll see, somebody's going to
get up one of these days and...</i>

314
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,102
They're called
social reformers.

315
00:22:01,171 --> 00:22:04,868
My history book's
full of them.

316
00:22:04,941 --> 00:22:07,808
So where is ours?

317
00:22:07,878 --> 00:22:14,113
I don't know, Sam.

318
00:22:14,184 --> 00:22:19,520
<i>Napoleon and the
Principle of Equality.</i>

319
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:32,197
<i>"Napoleon regarded
all people as equal under the law</i>

320
00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:38,208
<i>"and wanted them to have equal
opportunities for advancement.</i>

321
00:22:38,275 --> 00:22:40,368
All ves-ti-ges"...

322
00:22:40,444 --> 00:22:42,036
All that's
remaining.

323
00:22:42,112 --> 00:22:45,548
<i>"All vestiges of
the feudal system</i>

324
00:22:45,615 --> 00:22:49,984
with its oppression of
the poor were abolished. "

325
00:22:50,053 --> 00:22:55,719
Aha! There's the social reformer
that we've been waiting for.

326
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:59,159
<i>No, sure, Hally. He sounds
like somebody who is big.</i>

327
00:22:59,229 --> 00:23:02,027
<i>Big and important.</i>

328
00:23:02,098 --> 00:23:04,032
<i>What would you call it?</i>

329
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:08,901
A man of... magnitude.

330
00:23:08,972 --> 00:23:11,031
Magnitude. Aha.

331
00:23:11,107 --> 00:23:13,075
I don't know, Sam.

332
00:23:13,143 --> 00:23:15,134
Well, who would
you say was?

333
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:22,918
Abraham Lincoln.

334
00:23:22,986 --> 00:23:24,544
No, Sam, now
you're confusing

335
00:23:24,621 --> 00:23:26,748
historical significances
with greatness.

336
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:28,552
Try turning it
the other way.

337
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:29,751
I know what
I'm doing.

338
00:23:32,496 --> 00:23:33,986
How did it happen?

339
00:23:34,064 --> 00:23:39,400
Stop interfering
with my work, Sam.

340
00:23:39,469 --> 00:23:43,769
Wait a minute... I got it!
Darwin! Oharles Darwin.

341
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,570
<i>The Origin of the Species.
Remember?</i>

342
00:23:46,643 --> 00:23:48,270
He's your man
of magnitude?

343
00:23:48,345 --> 00:23:51,940
Ja, precisely. For his
theory of evolution.

344
00:23:52,015 --> 00:23:53,107
Who's yours?

345
00:23:53,183 --> 00:23:55,117
Jesus.

346
00:23:55,185 --> 00:23:56,345
Oh, come on, Sam.

347
00:23:56,419 --> 00:23:57,681
Jesus Ohrist.

348
00:23:57,754 --> 00:23:58,880
<i>The Messiah.</i>

349
00:23:58,955 --> 00:23:59,922
<i>Sam.</i>

350
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:01,252
<i>The Saviorl</i>

351
00:24:01,324 --> 00:24:02,814
Ja, but still...
No, Sam.

352
00:24:02,893 --> 00:24:04,793
Don't let's get
started on religion.

353
00:24:04,861 --> 00:24:06,419
I'm not going to waste my
time again arguing with you

354
00:24:06,496 --> 00:24:08,054
about the
existence of God!

355
00:24:08,131 --> 00:24:09,428
You know perfectly well
I'm an atheist

356
00:24:09,499 --> 00:24:10,966
and I've got
homework to do!

357
00:24:11,034 --> 00:24:14,060
Okay, Hally,
okay, I take him back.

358
00:24:14,137 --> 00:24:15,968
You have time
for one more name.

359
00:24:17,841 --> 00:24:19,809
Willie, what
are you doing?

360
00:24:19,876 --> 00:24:21,571
Singing with God,
Master Harold.

361
00:24:21,645 --> 00:24:24,637
Ohh.

362
00:24:24,714 --> 00:24:26,147
Hally! I've got one.

363
00:24:26,216 --> 00:24:27,979
I doubt it.

364
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:33,648
Think moldy
apricot jam.

365
00:24:33,723 --> 00:24:37,989
Penicillin and
Sir Alexander Fleming!

366
00:24:38,061 --> 00:24:40,825
Splendid, Sam! Splendid!

367
00:24:40,897 --> 00:24:43,263
It's deeply gratifying
to know that I haven't

368
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:45,301
been wasting my time
in talking to you.

369
00:24:45,368 --> 00:24:47,336
<i>Tolstoy may have
educated his peasants</i>

370
00:24:47,404 --> 00:24:48,769
but I've educated you.

371
00:24:48,838 --> 00:24:51,432
My first lesson
was geography.

372
00:24:51,508 --> 00:24:56,502
Geography? God, ja, the
J ubilee Boarding House.

373
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:59,344
That's how it all started.

374
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:01,782
<i>Nothing but bloody
misery wherever you went.</i>

375
00:25:01,851 --> 00:25:04,285
Somebody was always
complaining about the food

376
00:25:04,354 --> 00:25:06,686
or my mother was having
a fight with M icky Nash

377
00:25:06,756 --> 00:25:09,657
<i>because she'd caught her with
a petty officer in her room.</i>

378
00:25:09,726 --> 00:25:11,853
<i>Maude Meiring
was another one.</i>

379
00:25:11,928 --> 00:25:13,418
Do you remember
those two?

380
00:25:13,496 --> 00:25:16,294
There were prostitutes,
you know. Ja.

381
00:25:16,366 --> 00:25:18,857
Soldiers and sailors
from the troopships.

382
00:25:18,935 --> 00:25:23,201
Bottom fell out of the
business when the war ended.

383
00:25:23,273 --> 00:25:25,173
<i>God, the flotsam and
jetsam that life</i>

384
00:25:25,241 --> 00:25:26,674
<i>washed up on
our shores, eh?</i>

385
00:25:26,743 --> 00:25:29,337
The memories
are coming back now.

386
00:25:29,412 --> 00:25:32,074
Walking home from
school and thinking:

387
00:25:32,148 --> 00:25:34,708
"What can I do
this afternoon?"

388
00:25:34,784 --> 00:25:36,911
And tried a few ideas,
but sooner or later

389
00:25:36,987 --> 00:25:39,717
I'd end up back in
there with you fellows.

390
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:41,552
Like that time
I barged in

391
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:45,026
and caught you and
Myriam... at it. Remember?

392
00:25:52,235 --> 00:25:54,897
Hell, Sam, couldn't you have
waited until it was dark?

393
00:25:54,971 --> 00:26:00,204
No...

394
00:26:00,276 --> 00:26:01,709
And if you
don't believe me

395
00:26:01,778 --> 00:26:04,076
wait until
your time comes.

396
00:26:04,147 --> 00:26:06,877
No, thanks.

397
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:09,544
Now, where was I?

398
00:26:09,619 --> 00:26:14,352
Oh, ja, a gray little room
with a cold cement floor.

399
00:26:14,424 --> 00:26:16,688
Your bed was
against that wall.

400
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,728
And I now know why the
mattress sagged so much!

401
00:26:20,964 --> 00:26:24,058
Sam, your things neat and tidy
in a trunk right next to your bed

402
00:26:24,134 --> 00:26:28,093
<i>and on it is a picture
of you and Myriam</i>

403
00:26:28,171 --> 00:26:30,435
<i>in your ballroom clothes</i>

404
00:26:30,507 --> 00:26:32,372
<i>your first silver cup</i>

405
00:26:32,442 --> 00:26:34,910
<i>for third place
in a competition</i>

406
00:26:34,978 --> 00:26:35,876
<i>and an old radio.</i>

407
00:26:38,114 --> 00:26:41,606
<i>Sam, do you want me to
teach you about South Africa?</i>

408
00:26:41,685 --> 00:26:44,210
Sure, I'd like to learn
about South Africa.

409
00:26:44,287 --> 00:26:47,085
<i>Right, repeat
after me, Sam.</i>

410
00:26:47,157 --> 00:26:49,057
Gold in the Transvaal.

411
00:26:49,125 --> 00:26:50,615
<i>Gold in the Transvaal.</i>

412
00:26:50,694 --> 00:26:52,286
<i>Mealies in the Free State.</i>

413
00:26:52,362 --> 00:26:53,761
<i>Mealies in the Free State.</i>

414
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:54,956
<i>Sugar in Natal.</i>

415
00:26:55,031 --> 00:26:56,225
Sugar in Natal.

416
00:26:56,299 --> 00:26:57,789
<i>Grapes in the Cape.</i>

417
00:26:57,867 --> 00:26:59,596
<i>Grapes in the Cape.</i>

418
00:26:59,669 --> 00:27:02,399
Good. Okay, now once
more from the beginning.

419
00:27:02,472 --> 00:27:05,100
Haai man, haai, it's
too late for school.

420
00:27:05,175 --> 00:27:06,403
What are you
doing in bed, Willie?

421
00:27:06,476 --> 00:27:07,636
Hey, wena.

422
00:27:07,711 --> 00:27:08,575
<i>Williel</i>

423
00:27:12,582 --> 00:27:15,415
<i>Hally, are you in there?</i>

424
00:27:18,888 --> 00:27:22,483
Sam, Willie... Is he
in here with you boys?

425
00:27:24,861 --> 00:27:27,523
Hally, will you come
out of there at once!

426
00:27:28,565 --> 00:27:30,624
So much for
friendship, huh.

427
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,998
Hally, we couldn't lie
to her, she already knew.

428
00:27:33,069 --> 00:27:35,503
Ha, it's more likely your
brain was getting fried

429
00:27:35,572 --> 00:27:37,301
and you wanted me
out of there

430
00:27:37,373 --> 00:27:38,897
before I got on to the
rivers and mountains.

431
00:27:38,975 --> 00:27:41,170
No, Hally, I was happy
for the lesson.

432
00:27:41,244 --> 00:27:44,179
But, come now, Hally,
it wasn't all so bad.

433
00:27:44,247 --> 00:27:45,305
Ja, it was.

434
00:27:45,381 --> 00:27:46,848
No, Hally.

435
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:49,441
Okay, maybe there
was one good day.

436
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:50,486
<i>Only one?</i>

437
00:27:50,553 --> 00:27:52,817
Ja.

438
00:27:52,889 --> 00:27:55,858
<i>And?</i>

439
00:27:55,925 --> 00:27:57,085
Come on, Sam...

440
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,185
<i>Tell us, Hally.</i>

441
00:27:59,262 --> 00:28:02,857
<i>Please, Master
Harold, we want to hear.</i>

442
00:28:04,434 --> 00:28:06,129
It started off

443
00:28:06,202 --> 00:28:08,636
looking like another
of those useless

444
00:28:08,705 --> 00:28:10,434
<i>nothing to do afternoons.</i>

445
00:28:17,113 --> 00:28:20,207
<i>I'd already been down to Main
Street looking for adventure.</i>

446
00:28:20,283 --> 00:28:21,875
<i>But nothing happened.</i>

447
00:28:21,951 --> 00:28:23,976
<i>I didn't feel like
climbing trees</i>

448
00:28:24,053 --> 00:28:27,045
or pretending I was a private
eye and following a stranger

449
00:28:27,123 --> 00:28:30,058
so, as usual:

450
00:28:30,126 --> 00:28:31,684
See what's cooking
in Sam's room.

451
00:28:39,736 --> 00:28:43,695
<i>This time it was
you on the floor.</i>

452
00:28:43,773 --> 00:28:45,866
<i>You had two
thin pieces of wood</i>

453
00:28:45,942 --> 00:28:48,843
<i>and you were smoothing
them down with a knife.</i>

454
00:28:48,912 --> 00:28:51,073
<i>It didn't look
particularly interesting</i>

455
00:28:51,147 --> 00:28:52,910
<i>but when I asked you
what you were doing</i>

456
00:28:52,982 --> 00:28:54,677
<i>you just said</i>

457
00:28:54,751 --> 00:28:58,847
<i>"Wait and see, Hally.
Wait and see... "</i>

458
00:28:58,922 --> 00:29:00,583
<i>in that secret way of yours</i>

459
00:29:00,657 --> 00:29:02,522
<i>so I knew there was
a surprise coming.</i>

460
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:05,083
You teased me, you bugger,
by being deliberately slow

461
00:29:05,161 --> 00:29:07,095
<i>not answering
my questionsl</i>

462
00:29:07,163 --> 00:29:09,097
<i>And whistling
while you worked away I</i>

463
00:29:09,165 --> 00:29:11,759
<i>God, it was infuriating I
I could have brained you I</i>

464
00:29:11,835 --> 00:29:14,736
<i>It was only when you tied the two
pieces of wood together into a cross</i>

465
00:29:14,804 --> 00:29:16,431
<i>and put that down
on the brown paper</i>

466
00:29:16,506 --> 00:29:18,565
<i>that I realized
what you were doing.</i>

467
00:29:18,641 --> 00:29:20,666
<i>Sam's making a kite.</i>

468
00:29:20,743 --> 00:29:23,109
<i>I mean, the sheer audacity
of it took my breath away.</i>

469
00:29:23,179 --> 00:29:26,615
Seriously, what the hell does a
black man know about flying a kite?

470
00:29:26,683 --> 00:29:30,517
<i>I'll be honest with you, Sam, I
had no hope for it, none at all.</i>

471
00:29:30,587 --> 00:29:31,884
No, if you think I was
excited and happy

472
00:29:31,955 --> 00:29:34,116
you got another
guess coming.

473
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:36,715
I n fact, I was shit-scared we were
going to make fools of ourselves.

474
00:29:36,793 --> 00:29:38,055
Ja, I could see that.

475
00:29:38,127 --> 00:29:39,526
I made it
obvious, did I?

476
00:29:39,596 --> 00:29:41,530
<i>You refused
to carry it.</i>

477
00:29:41,598 --> 00:29:43,623
<i>Do you blame me?</i>

478
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:46,669
<i>Can you remember what the
poor thing looked like?</i>

479
00:29:46,736 --> 00:29:48,931
<i>Tomato-box wood,
brown paper</i>

480
00:29:49,005 --> 00:29:51,132
<i>Flour and water
for gluel</i>

481
00:29:51,207 --> 00:29:53,471
<i>And then two of my mother's
old stockings for a tail</i>

482
00:29:53,543 --> 00:29:55,443
<i>and all those bits and
pieces of string</i>

483
00:29:55,511 --> 00:29:57,843
<i>you had me tie together
so that we could fly it I</i>

484
00:29:57,914 --> 00:30:01,782
<i>Hell, no, that was only
asking for a miracle to happen.</i>

485
00:30:01,851 --> 00:30:04,479
No, Sam, that kite
will never fly.

486
00:30:04,554 --> 00:30:06,579
Not without a
tail it won't.

487
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,094
Harold!

488
00:30:18,167 --> 00:30:19,361
Hally!

489
00:30:21,104 --> 00:30:22,833
So what happened?

490
00:30:22,906 --> 00:30:25,340
Come on, Sam, you remember
it as well as I do.

491
00:30:25,408 --> 00:30:29,139
I want to hear
it from you.

492
00:30:57,206 --> 00:30:59,697
When I let the
kite go, you run.

493
00:30:59,776 --> 00:31:02,870
No, do you want me to
be a laughingstock?

494
00:31:02,946 --> 00:31:04,277
Of who?

495
00:31:09,118 --> 00:31:12,019
Come on now,
let's try it.

496
00:31:12,088 --> 00:31:13,646
This is it, I thought

497
00:31:13,723 --> 00:31:15,384
<i>like everything else
in my life</i>

498
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:17,323
<i>here comes another fiasco.</i>

499
00:31:17,393 --> 00:31:20,328
<i>Then you shouted,
"Go, Hally, gol"</i>

500
00:31:20,396 --> 00:31:23,729
Ready... and go.

501
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,859
<i>And I started to run.</i>

502
00:31:25,935 --> 00:31:28,836
<i>Faster, Hally I Fasterl</i>

503
00:31:28,905 --> 00:31:31,066
<i>I don't know how
to describe it, Sam.</i>

504
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,540
<i>Jal Ja, the miracle happened.</i>

505
00:31:33,609 --> 00:31:35,907
<i>I was running, waiting for it
to crash to the ground behind me</i>

506
00:31:35,979 --> 00:31:37,879
<i>but instead I felt something
alive at the end of the string</i>

507
00:31:37,947 --> 00:31:39,778
<i>tugging at it as if
it wanted to be free.</i>

508
00:31:39,849 --> 00:31:41,339
You shouted to me to
let it have more string

509
00:31:41,417 --> 00:31:43,783
and I did, until there
was none left

510
00:31:43,853 --> 00:31:45,912
<i>and I was just holding that one
piece of wood we'd tied to it.</i>

511
00:31:45,989 --> 00:31:50,255
<i>And I looked back and I
still can't believe my eyes.</i>

512
00:31:50,326 --> 00:31:51,918
It was flying!

513
00:31:51,995 --> 00:31:53,587
Looping around and trying to climb up

514
00:31:53,663 --> 00:31:55,722
<i>even higher
into the sky.</i>

515
00:31:55,798 --> 00:31:57,766
<i>It works, Sam,
it worksl We've done it I</i>

516
00:31:57,834 --> 00:32:00,268
<i>And we had. I was
so proud of us.</i>

517
00:32:00,336 --> 00:32:02,531
It was the most splendid
thing I'd ever seen.

518
00:32:02,605 --> 00:32:04,732
And you came up and joined me.
You were laughing.

519
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:10,438
She's beautiful, Sam.

520
00:32:10,513 --> 00:32:11,775
That she is.

521
00:32:16,853 --> 00:32:18,787
The part that
scared me, though

522
00:32:18,855 --> 00:32:20,686
was when you showed me how
to make it dive to the ground

523
00:32:20,757 --> 00:32:21,781
then just on
the point of crashing

524
00:32:21,858 --> 00:32:23,120
swoop it up again.

525
00:32:23,192 --> 00:32:24,250
You didn't
want to try it.

526
00:32:24,327 --> 00:32:26,295
<i>Of course not.</i>

527
00:32:26,362 --> 00:32:29,126
God, I'd have been suicidal
if anything had happened to it

528
00:32:29,198 --> 00:32:30,995
watching you do it
made me nervous enough.

529
00:32:31,067 --> 00:32:32,659
I was quite happy
just to see it up there

530
00:32:32,735 --> 00:32:34,896
with its tail
fluttering behind it.

531
00:32:46,816 --> 00:32:49,808
Who's laughing
at you now?

532
00:33:05,401 --> 00:33:07,392
You left me after
that, didn't you?

533
00:33:12,575 --> 00:33:15,169
You explained how
to get it down

534
00:33:15,244 --> 00:33:19,442
we tied it to the bench so
that I could sit and watch it

535
00:33:19,515 --> 00:33:22,348
but then you went away.

536
00:33:22,418 --> 00:33:24,511
I wanted you
to stay, you know.

537
00:33:24,587 --> 00:33:27,784
I was a little scared about
having to look after it by myself.

538
00:33:27,857 --> 00:33:29,757
I had work to do.

539
00:33:59,422 --> 00:34:01,720
Why'd you make
that kite, Sam?

540
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,484
I can't remember.

541
00:34:05,561 --> 00:34:08,860
Truly?

542
00:34:08,931 --> 00:34:12,389
Too long ago, Hally.

543
00:34:12,468 --> 00:34:14,527
It's time for
another one, you know

544
00:34:14,604 --> 00:34:17,232
wouldn't be a good
day to fly it, though.

545
00:34:17,306 --> 00:34:23,711
No, you can't fly
kites on rainy days.

546
00:34:23,779 --> 00:34:25,076
Strange, isn't it?

547
00:34:25,148 --> 00:34:27,207
What?

548
00:34:27,283 --> 00:34:29,410
You and me

549
00:34:29,485 --> 00:34:32,511
a little white boy and a
black man flying a kite.

550
00:34:32,588 --> 00:34:34,249
Not every day
you see that.

551
00:34:34,323 --> 00:34:35,585
But why strange?

552
00:34:38,661 --> 00:34:40,322
I don't know.

553
00:34:40,396 --> 00:34:42,193
Would have been just
as strange, I suppose

554
00:34:42,265 --> 00:34:43,664
had it been
me and my dad.

555
00:34:43,733 --> 00:34:45,030
A crippled man
and a white boy.

556
00:34:45,101 --> 00:34:46,693
Nope!

557
00:34:46,769 --> 00:34:48,100
No, there's no chance
of me flying a kite

558
00:34:48,171 --> 00:34:51,436
without it being strange.

559
00:34:51,507 --> 00:34:53,941
There's a nice little
story in that, you know.

560
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:56,604
"The Kite-Flyers. "

561
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:58,704
But we'd have to find
a twist in the ending.

562
00:34:58,781 --> 00:35:00,009
Twist...?

563
00:35:00,082 --> 00:35:02,880
Yes, something unexpected.

564
00:35:02,952 --> 00:35:05,750
I mean, the way it ended with
us was far too straightforward...

565
00:35:05,821 --> 00:35:07,880
me on the bench and
you going back to work.

566
00:35:07,957 --> 00:35:09,481
There's no drama in that.

567
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:23,301
<i>St. George's Park Tea Room.</i>

568
00:35:23,372 --> 00:35:25,806
Yes, Madam.

569
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:27,137
He's here.

570
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:28,802
Hally?

571
00:35:28,878 --> 00:35:30,470
It's your mother.

572
00:35:34,884 --> 00:35:36,283
Hello Mom?

573
00:35:36,352 --> 00:35:38,252
Hally, I'm bringing
Daddy home.

574
00:35:41,224 --> 00:35:44,455
Oh, God!

575
00:35:44,527 --> 00:35:46,461
<i>But how can he get better so suddenly?</i>

576
00:35:46,529 --> 00:35:48,429
He's not really better

577
00:35:48,497 --> 00:35:51,022
it's just... he wants
to come home.

578
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,591
Well, well, then very
obviously you must say no!

579
00:35:53,669 --> 00:35:55,796
<i>Be firm with him, Mom.</i>

580
00:35:55,871 --> 00:35:58,840
Say Dr. Oolley wants
more X-rays of his stump.

581
00:35:58,908 --> 00:36:01,604
Or bribe him. We'll sneak
double tots of brandy in future.

582
00:36:01,677 --> 00:36:04,009
But Daddy's already up
and ready to go, Hally.

583
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,446
Well, order him to get
back into bed at once!

584
00:36:06,515 --> 00:36:08,506
If he's going to behave like
a child, treat him like one.

585
00:36:08,584 --> 00:36:10,313
<i>No, Hally I Nol</i>

586
00:36:10,386 --> 00:36:13,446
<i>Okay, Mom I I was just trying to...</i>

587
00:36:13,522 --> 00:36:15,012
<i>You know how
much he loves you.</i>

588
00:36:15,091 --> 00:36:16,388
I'm sorry.

589
00:36:16,459 --> 00:36:17,721
That's not good, Hally.

590
00:36:17,793 --> 00:36:19,556
I said I'm sorry.

591
00:36:19,629 --> 00:36:22,860
<i>Wait, my tickey-box
is running out.</i>

592
00:36:22,932 --> 00:36:24,490
Tell the boys when they're
finished with the floors

593
00:36:24,567 --> 00:36:26,125
they must clean
the windows.

594
00:36:26,202 --> 00:36:29,399
Okay, Mom, just
listen to me carefully.

595
00:36:29,472 --> 00:36:32,202
All it needs is for you
to put your foot down.

596
00:36:32,275 --> 00:36:33,503
Do you hear me?

597
00:36:33,576 --> 00:36:35,908
I'll see what
I can do.

598
00:36:53,129 --> 00:36:55,825
My mom says that when you're
finished with the floors

599
00:36:55,898 --> 00:36:57,263
you must do the windows.

600
00:37:05,574 --> 00:37:08,065
Don't misunderstand
me, chaps

601
00:37:08,144 --> 00:37:10,738
all I want is for
him to get better.

602
00:37:10,813 --> 00:37:14,579
And if he was, I'd be the first
person to say, "Bring him home"

603
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:16,277
but he's just not.

604
00:37:18,921 --> 00:37:22,118
So don't just stand there!
Get on with it!

605
00:37:34,337 --> 00:37:36,862
<i>What about when he's home?</i>

606
00:37:36,939 --> 00:37:39,237
<i>Do you want me to pass my exams at
the end of the year or don't you?</i>

607
00:37:39,308 --> 00:37:40,775
Agh, Hally, don't
start with that talk.

608
00:37:40,843 --> 00:37:42,708
I'm supposed to be
fresh for school

609
00:37:42,778 --> 00:37:43,938
and I spend half the night
massaging his gammy leg.

610
00:37:44,013 --> 00:37:45,275
Hally, respect!

611
00:37:45,348 --> 00:37:47,441
I'm not being
disrespectful

612
00:37:47,516 --> 00:37:49,211
I'm just sick and tired of
changing his stinking chamber pots

613
00:37:49,285 --> 00:37:50,252
full of phlegm and piss.

614
00:37:50,319 --> 00:37:52,082
No, you don't.

615
00:37:52,154 --> 00:37:54,418
I do. When you're not
there he asks me to do it.

616
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:56,822
Why do you think I've got
no appetite for my food?

617
00:37:56,892 --> 00:37:58,450
You're not eating?

618
00:37:58,527 --> 00:38:00,791
There's a lot of
things you don't know.

619
00:38:00,863 --> 00:38:03,297
For your information, I still haven't
got that science textbook I need.

620
00:38:03,366 --> 00:38:04,993
Well, I gave
you the money.

621
00:38:05,067 --> 00:38:06,091
Yes, and he
borrowed it.

622
00:38:06,168 --> 00:38:07,897
For what?

623
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:11,201
Why do you think, Mom? Booze.

624
00:38:13,476 --> 00:38:15,535
All I can say
is fick-it-all.

625
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:24,246
I'm sure he'll
listen to your mom.

626
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:30,020
Please, Sam. He'll
tie her up in knots.

627
00:38:30,092 --> 00:38:32,583
I suppose he
gets lonely there.

628
00:38:32,661 --> 00:38:34,993
With all the nurses
and patients around?

629
00:38:35,064 --> 00:38:38,090
Regular visits from
the Salvation Army. Balls!

630
00:38:38,167 --> 00:38:41,000
It's ten times worse
for him at home.

631
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:42,799
I'm at school and my
mother's here all day.

632
00:38:42,872 --> 00:38:44,339
At least he's
got you at night.

633
00:38:44,407 --> 00:38:45,931
And we've got him!

634
00:38:52,581 --> 00:38:55,311
<i>Lts just a plain
bloody mess, this is.</i>

635
00:38:55,384 --> 00:38:58,512
And people are fools. They
bloody well deserve what they get.

636
00:38:58,587 --> 00:39:00,350
<i>All right, Hally, all right.</i>

637
00:39:00,423 --> 00:39:02,357
What homework
do you have?

638
00:39:02,425 --> 00:39:04,052
<i>Bullshit as usual.</i>

639
00:39:04,126 --> 00:39:06,060
Write 500 words
describing an annual event

640
00:39:06,128 --> 00:39:08,528
of cultural or
historical significance.

641
00:39:08,597 --> 00:39:10,189
Well, that should be
easy enough for you.

642
00:39:10,266 --> 00:39:11,824
<i>Please, Sam I
Just leave me.</i>

643
00:39:11,901 --> 00:39:13,801
<i>I'm not in
the mood for games.</i>

644
00:39:13,869 --> 00:39:16,030
And remember, you're to
help Willie with the windows.

645
00:39:16,105 --> 00:39:17,800
Come on, now. I don't
want any nonsense.

646
00:39:17,873 --> 00:39:19,431
All right,
all right.

647
00:39:31,253 --> 00:39:32,652
Scary enough?

648
00:39:32,721 --> 00:39:34,245
It could've been
scarier, chum.

649
00:39:34,323 --> 00:39:37,019
Yes, the music
was creepy.

650
00:39:37,092 --> 00:39:39,390
<i>Really creepy.</i>

651
00:39:39,462 --> 00:39:42,226
How about when the woman
went into the church?

652
00:39:42,298 --> 00:39:45,028
We saw the dark
shadow following her?

653
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,568
That's when you first
grabbed my arm, right?

654
00:39:47,636 --> 00:39:48,796
Right.

655
00:39:52,441 --> 00:39:55,205
If you didn't lose
your leg in the last war

656
00:39:55,277 --> 00:39:57,438
<i>you would be there,
wouldn't you, Dad?</i>

657
00:39:57,513 --> 00:39:58,502
Fighting H itler?

658
00:40:03,752 --> 00:40:06,414
I didn't lose my leg
in the war, chum.

659
00:40:06,489 --> 00:40:08,081
I fell down the
ship's gangway

660
00:40:08,157 --> 00:40:09,920
on the trip over
from South Hampton.

661
00:40:09,992 --> 00:40:12,483
<i>I never got
to the war, Hally.</i>

662
00:40:23,672 --> 00:40:27,870
<i>One, two, three, one...</i>

663
00:40:27,943 --> 00:40:31,902
One, two, three, one...

664
00:40:31,981 --> 00:40:35,041
One, two, three.

665
00:40:35,117 --> 00:40:36,516
<i>Much better.</i>

666
00:40:36,585 --> 00:40:38,416
Just a little
quick on the turn.

667
00:40:38,487 --> 00:40:41,115
See what happens when you
relax and enjoy yourself.

668
00:40:42,858 --> 00:40:45,918
But I don't have
a partner, Boet Sam.

669
00:40:45,995 --> 00:40:48,589
Maybe Hilda will
turn up tonight?

670
00:40:48,664 --> 00:40:52,122
No, I gave her
a good hiding.

671
00:40:52,201 --> 00:40:53,634
You mean a bad one.

672
00:40:53,702 --> 00:40:55,636
Good bad one.

673
00:40:55,704 --> 00:40:57,934
<i>They'll refund you
if you withdraw now.</i>

674
00:40:58,007 --> 00:41:01,568
No! I wait too long
and I practice too hard.

675
00:41:01,644 --> 00:41:02,906
Then find Hilda.

676
00:41:02,978 --> 00:41:04,605
Tell her that
you are sorry

677
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,614
and that you promise
not to beat her again.

678
00:41:06,682 --> 00:41:07,649
No.

679
00:41:07,716 --> 00:41:08,478
Then withdraw.

680
00:41:08,551 --> 00:41:09,609
No!

681
00:41:09,685 --> 00:41:11,243
<i>Then I give up.</i>

682
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,220
<i>Haaikona, Boet Sam,
you can't.</i>

683
00:41:13,289 --> 00:41:15,917
What do you mean, I can't?
I'm telling you, I give up.

684
00:41:15,991 --> 00:41:18,892
No! It was you who start
me ballroom dancing.

685
00:41:18,961 --> 00:41:20,326
So?

686
00:41:20,396 --> 00:41:23,991
Before that, I
used to be happy.

687
00:41:24,066 --> 00:41:26,091
Are you blaming me?

688
00:41:26,168 --> 00:41:27,294
Yes.

689
00:41:27,369 --> 00:41:28,768
Hey Willie... Willie?

690
00:41:28,837 --> 00:41:30,828
And now all you
do is make jokes?

691
00:41:30,906 --> 00:41:34,637
You wait. When Myriam leave
you, it will be my turn to laugh.

692
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:35,972
Ha! Ha! Ha!

693
00:41:36,045 --> 00:41:37,512
If Myriam leaves me tonight

694
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:38,842
I know what to do.

695
00:41:38,914 --> 00:41:40,142
U h-huh?

696
00:41:40,215 --> 00:41:42,775
May I have
the pleasure?

697
00:41:42,851 --> 00:41:45,183
<i># I'm just a fellow
with a pillow #</i>

698
00:41:45,254 --> 00:41:46,949
Sam!

699
00:41:47,022 --> 00:41:50,685
<i># Dancin' like a willow
I n the autumn breeze #</i>

700
00:41:50,759 --> 00:41:52,989
<i>Boet Sam I Boet Sam I
I swear, I don't know...</i>

701
00:41:53,062 --> 00:41:57,021
For Ohrist's sake,
you two! Sam, Willie!

702
00:41:58,767 --> 00:42:00,496
How the hell am I
supposed to concentrate?

703
00:42:00,569 --> 00:42:02,161
He start doing...

704
00:42:02,237 --> 00:42:04,296
Shut up, Willie. Get on with your work.

705
00:42:04,373 --> 00:42:09,709
You too, Sam.

706
00:42:09,778 --> 00:42:12,212
Do you want
another one, Willie?

707
00:42:12,281 --> 00:42:20,052
Willie.

708
00:42:20,122 --> 00:42:22,317
<i>Suppose a customer
had walked in then?</i>

709
00:42:22,391 --> 00:42:24,382
Or the park superintendent?

710
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:26,826
That would have been the
end of my mother's license

711
00:42:26,895 --> 00:42:27,827
and your jobs!

712
00:42:32,635 --> 00:42:34,535
Well, from now on
there will be no more

713
00:42:34,603 --> 00:42:36,867
of your ballroom
nonsense in here.

714
00:42:36,939 --> 00:42:38,566
<i>It's a harmless
pleasure, Hally.</i>

715
00:42:38,641 --> 00:42:40,871
It's also a rather
simple one, you know.

716
00:42:40,943 --> 00:42:43,537
You reckon so?
Have you ever tried?

717
00:42:43,612 --> 00:42:46,376
You're not asking me to take
ballroom dancing serious, are you?

718
00:42:46,448 --> 00:42:48,473
Yes.

719
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:51,542
Oh, well, so much for trying
to give you a decent education.

720
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:54,521
<i>What's wrong with admiring
something that is beautiful</i>

721
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:56,421
and then trying
to do it yourself?

722
00:42:56,492 --> 00:42:59,017
I'm sure the word you mean
to use is entertaining.

723
00:42:59,094 --> 00:43:00,356
<i>No. Beautiful.</i>

724
00:43:00,429 --> 00:43:02,761
And if you want proof

725
00:43:02,831 --> 00:43:05,197
<i>come to the Centenary Hall in
New Brighton in two weeks' time.</i>

726
00:43:05,267 --> 00:43:08,065
Please, Sam, I've seen the two of you
prancing around in here often enough.

727
00:43:08,137 --> 00:43:10,264
Look, this is not the real
thing, Hally... We're just...

728
00:43:10,339 --> 00:43:12,705
So? I can use
my imagination.

729
00:43:12,775 --> 00:43:14,936
And?

730
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:17,774
I see lot of people dancing around
and having a so-called good time.

731
00:43:17,846 --> 00:43:20,110
<i>We're getting ready
for the championships, Hally</i>

732
00:43:20,182 --> 00:43:21,774
not just another dance.

733
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:23,613
<i>Yes, there will
be a lot of people</i>

734
00:43:23,686 --> 00:43:25,551
<i>and yes, they will be
having a good time</i>

735
00:43:25,621 --> 00:43:28,089
but those are
only spectators.

736
00:43:28,157 --> 00:43:31,285
It's just the competitors
out there on the dance floor.

737
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:35,091
<i>Party decorations and fancy
lights all around the walls.</i>

738
00:43:35,164 --> 00:43:38,463
And the ladies in beautiful
evening dresses!

739
00:43:38,534 --> 00:43:40,764
My mother's got
one of those, Sam

740
00:43:40,836 --> 00:43:42,929
and quite frankly it's an
embarrassment every time she wears it.

741
00:43:43,005 --> 00:43:45,633
<i>And your imagination
left out the excitement.</i>

742
00:43:45,708 --> 00:43:47,903
<i>One of those couples will be</i>

743
00:43:47,976 --> 00:43:52,242
<i>the 1950
Eastern Province Champions.</i>

744
00:43:52,314 --> 00:43:55,647
And your imagination
left out the music.

745
00:43:57,553 --> 00:43:58,918
<i>Mr. Elijah Gladman Guzanna</i>

746
00:43:58,987 --> 00:44:02,013
and his
Orchestral Jazzonians!

747
00:45:00,949 --> 00:45:03,509
And finally,
your imagination

748
00:45:03,585 --> 00:45:05,576
left out the climax
of the evening.

749
00:45:05,654 --> 00:45:07,849
<i>The dancing is finished</i>

750
00:45:07,923 --> 00:45:11,518
<i>and the judges have stopped
whispering among themselves.</i>

751
00:45:11,593 --> 00:45:14,391
<i>The Master of Ceremonies
collects the scorecards</i>

752
00:45:14,463 --> 00:45:19,332
<i>and goes up to the stage
to announce the finalists.</i>

753
00:45:19,401 --> 00:45:23,167
Okay. And you say it
takes place every year?

754
00:45:23,238 --> 00:45:24,830
Every year, Master Harold.

755
00:45:24,907 --> 00:45:28,365
But only every third
year in New Brighton.

756
00:45:28,443 --> 00:45:31,412
Which, I guess, makes it an
even more significant event.

757
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:38,716
Our "occasion" is now
a "significant event. "

758
00:45:38,787 --> 00:45:41,688
I wonder.

759
00:45:41,757 --> 00:45:49,357
"Write 500 words describing an annual event
of cultural or historical significance. "

760
00:45:49,431 --> 00:45:53,265
<i>You going to write
about it, Master Hally?</i>

761
00:45:53,335 --> 00:45:54,393
Shall we give it a go?

762
00:45:54,469 --> 00:45:55,401
I'm ready.

763
00:45:55,470 --> 00:45:57,495
Me also.

764
00:45:57,573 --> 00:46:00,940
Right. To build the tension
and suspense, I need facts, Sam.

765
00:46:01,009 --> 00:46:02,943
Give him facts, Boet Sam. Facts!

766
00:46:03,011 --> 00:46:05,775
What you called the
climax... how many finalists?

767
00:46:05,848 --> 00:46:07,110
Six couples.

768
00:46:07,182 --> 00:46:09,241
Go on. Give
me the picture.

769
00:46:09,318 --> 00:46:11,786
<i>The six finalists
go onto the dance floor</i>

770
00:46:11,854 --> 00:46:13,754
and take up
their positions.

771
00:46:13,822 --> 00:46:16,256
<i>The Master of Ceremonies
goes to the microphone.</i>

772
00:46:19,695 --> 00:46:22,892
<i>Ja... sh... we know
how to make a noise, hey?</i>

773
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,798
But that's okay, it means we
know how to enjoy ourselves.

774
00:46:27,870 --> 00:46:31,135
And isn't that
what we're here for!

775
00:46:31,206 --> 00:46:33,106
<i>Ladies and gentlemen.</i>

776
00:46:33,175 --> 00:46:36,076
My, my, my.

777
00:46:36,144 --> 00:46:38,408
Aren't they looking
absolutely beautiful?

778
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,471
<i>Yesl Yesl</i>

779
00:46:43,652 --> 00:46:45,984
<i>No, I'm not talking
about our judges</i>

780
00:46:46,054 --> 00:46:48,420
I'm talking
about our finalists.

781
00:46:55,197 --> 00:46:57,165
That's a good
touch... a joke.

782
00:46:57,232 --> 00:46:59,166
Oreating a relaxed atmosphere
which will soon change

783
00:46:59,234 --> 00:47:02,328
to one of tension and drama
as the climax is approached.

784
00:47:04,172 --> 00:47:06,163
<i>Ladies and gentlemen</i>

785
00:47:06,241 --> 00:47:09,267
we've now come
to the great moment

786
00:47:09,344 --> 00:47:11,437
that we've been
waiting for this evening.

787
00:47:11,513 --> 00:47:13,947
The finals of the 1950

788
00:47:14,016 --> 00:47:17,679
Eastern Province Open
Ballroom Dancing Ohampionships.

789
00:47:20,188 --> 00:47:23,282
Let me introduce
the finalists!

790
00:47:23,358 --> 00:47:28,819
Mr. And Mrs. Welcome
Tchabalala from Kingwilliamstown!

791
00:47:30,899 --> 00:47:33,197
<i>Mr. M ulligan N kikelane</i>

792
00:47:33,268 --> 00:47:36,567
and Miss Nomhle N konyeni
of Grahamstown.

793
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:41,572
Mr. Fats Bokolane

794
00:47:41,643 --> 00:47:44,840
and Miss Dina Plaatjies
from East London.

795
00:47:49,318 --> 00:47:52,253
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Down, boys. Down, boys.</i>

796
00:47:59,594 --> 00:48:04,054
Mr. Willie Malopo
and Miss Hilda Samuels!

797
00:48:10,238 --> 00:48:11,762
Me?

798
00:48:21,416 --> 00:48:22,383
Hilda!

799
00:48:26,421 --> 00:48:29,413
Relaxed and
ready to romance.

800
00:48:32,661 --> 00:48:37,621
<i>Okay, here we go.
Take it away, boys.</i>

801
00:48:53,615 --> 00:48:56,982
One, two, three.

802
00:48:57,052 --> 00:48:59,418
One, two, three.

803
00:48:59,488 --> 00:49:01,922
One, two, three.

804
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:03,548
One, two, three.

805
00:49:03,625 --> 00:49:05,252
Good, that's good.
Keep it up, Willie!

806
00:49:05,327 --> 00:49:07,056
Okay, now how are
the points scored?

807
00:49:07,129 --> 00:49:08,926
<i>A maximum of 10 points each</i>

808
00:49:08,997 --> 00:49:12,125
<i>for individual style,
deportment, rhythm</i>

809
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,430
and general appearance.

810
00:49:14,503 --> 00:49:15,765
And penalties?

811
00:49:15,837 --> 00:49:17,202
Penalties?

812
00:49:17,272 --> 00:49:18,967
Ja. For doing
something wrong.

813
00:49:19,041 --> 00:49:20,736
<i>Say you stumble
or bump into somebody.</i>

814
00:49:20,809 --> 00:49:21,798
Hally...

815
00:49:21,877 --> 00:49:22,901
What?

816
00:49:22,978 --> 00:49:24,138
Willie.

817
00:49:24,212 --> 00:49:25,645
What?

818
00:49:25,714 --> 00:49:27,409
He wants to know
what happens

819
00:49:27,482 --> 00:49:29,109
if me and Myriam bump
into you and Hilda.

820
00:49:30,352 --> 00:49:32,582
Why? What did I say?

821
00:49:32,654 --> 00:49:36,112
Hally, there are no
collisions out there.

822
00:49:36,191 --> 00:49:38,386
That's what that
moment is all about.

823
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:41,429
To be one of the finalists out
there on that dance floor is like...

824
00:49:41,496 --> 00:49:44,829
like being in a dream about a world
in which accidents don't happen.

825
00:49:46,835 --> 00:49:49,463
Jesus, Sam!
That's beautiful.

826
00:49:49,538 --> 00:49:51,836
Ja, it is, Master Hally.

827
00:49:51,907 --> 00:49:54,501
It's beautiful because that's
what we want life to be.

828
00:49:54,576 --> 00:49:56,237
But instead,
like you, Hally

829
00:49:56,311 --> 00:49:58,176
we're bumping into
each other all the time.

830
00:49:58,246 --> 00:49:59,645
None of us
know the steps

831
00:49:59,714 --> 00:50:01,147
and there's no
music playing.

832
00:50:01,216 --> 00:50:03,275
And it doesn't
just stop with us.

833
00:50:03,351 --> 00:50:05,615
America is bumping
into Russia

834
00:50:05,687 --> 00:50:07,518
England is bumping
into I ndia

835
00:50:07,589 --> 00:50:09,819
rich man
into poor man.

836
00:50:09,891 --> 00:50:11,756
Those are
big collisions.

837
00:50:11,827 --> 00:50:14,125
People get hurt and we're
sick and tired of it now.

838
00:50:14,196 --> 00:50:16,858
Are we never going
to get it right, Hally?

839
00:50:16,932 --> 00:50:19,526
Learn to dance
life like champions

840
00:50:19,601 --> 00:50:23,537
instead of always being just
a bunch of beginners at it.

841
00:50:23,605 --> 00:50:25,300
You've got a vision, Sam.

842
00:50:25,373 --> 00:50:29,833
Not just me.
Everybody's got it.

843
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:34,207
That's why there's only standing
room left at the Oentenary Hall.

844
00:50:34,282 --> 00:50:36,716
For as long
as the music lasts

845
00:50:36,785 --> 00:50:40,380
we are going to see
six couples get it right

846
00:50:40,455 --> 00:50:43,049
the way we want
life to be.

847
00:50:43,125 --> 00:50:46,219
Is this the best
we can do, Sam?

848
00:50:46,294 --> 00:50:48,524
Dream about the way
it should be?

849
00:50:48,597 --> 00:50:52,533
Without the dream we won't
know what we're going for.

850
00:50:52,601 --> 00:50:54,330
Oh, when you come
to think of it

851
00:50:54,402 --> 00:50:56,734
that's what the U nited Nations
boils down to...

852
00:50:56,805 --> 00:50:58,568
a dancing school
for politicians!

853
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:01,905
H mmm. Let's hope
they learn, Hally.

854
00:51:01,977 --> 00:51:05,071
All right. This is a lot
bigger than I thought.

855
00:51:05,147 --> 00:51:06,705
So what have we got?

856
00:51:06,781 --> 00:51:09,909
Our title. "A World
Without Oollisions. "

857
00:51:09,985 --> 00:51:15,082
"A World Without
Oollisions. " Beautiful.

858
00:51:15,157 --> 00:51:18,558
Subtitle, "Global Politics
on the Dance Floor. "

859
00:51:18,627 --> 00:51:19,753
Eh.

860
00:51:19,828 --> 00:51:21,591
Nah, a bit heavy, hey?

861
00:51:21,663 --> 00:51:24,564
How about " Ballroom
Dancing as a Political Vision"?

862
00:51:42,317 --> 00:51:47,778
Saint George's
Park Tea Room.

863
00:51:47,856 --> 00:51:50,620
Yes, Madam.

864
00:51:50,692 --> 00:51:51,818
Hally, it's your mom.

865
00:51:57,799 --> 00:52:00,029
<i>Hally, she's waiting.</i>

866
00:52:25,327 --> 00:52:27,124
Hello, Mom.

867
00:52:27,195 --> 00:52:29,060
I've brought
Daddy home, Hally.

868
00:52:32,167 --> 00:52:34,294
<i>Hally.</i>

869
00:52:34,369 --> 00:52:38,430
<i>Hally, are you there?</i>

870
00:52:38,506 --> 00:52:40,940
Well, I just hope you know
what you've let us in for.

871
00:52:41,009 --> 00:52:43,944
Give him a chance. Please?

872
00:52:44,012 --> 00:52:45,843
<i>Okay, Mom I</i>

873
00:52:45,914 --> 00:52:48,178
But just remember to start
hiding your bag away again

874
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:52,186
because he'll be at your purse
before long, for money, for booze.

875
00:52:52,254 --> 00:52:54,188
<i>I don't want to hear
you talking like this.</i>

876
00:52:54,256 --> 00:52:56,190
Then don't complain to me
when he starts his old tricks.

877
00:52:56,258 --> 00:52:58,624
When do I ever
complain to you?

878
00:52:58,693 --> 00:53:01,059
Yes, I get it from you one side
and him on the other

879
00:53:01,129 --> 00:53:03,154
and it makes
life hell for me.

880
00:53:03,231 --> 00:53:04,664
I'm warning you now when the
two of you start fighting again

881
00:53:04,733 --> 00:53:07,224
I'm leaving home.

882
00:53:07,302 --> 00:53:09,702
<i>Oh, Hally,
how can you...</i>

883
00:53:09,771 --> 00:53:13,468
Mom, if you start crying, I'm
going to put down the receiver.

884
00:53:13,541 --> 00:53:15,338
That's enough now.

885
00:53:15,410 --> 00:53:20,677
<i>We're all going to try
to do our very best.</i>

886
00:53:20,749 --> 00:53:22,808
Okay, Mom.

887
00:53:22,884 --> 00:53:24,112
Aren't we, Hally?

888
00:53:24,185 --> 00:53:25,982
Okay, Mom.
I heard you.

889
00:53:26,054 --> 00:53:28,045
Do you want
to say hello?

890
00:53:28,123 --> 00:53:29,385
No! I'll see him
when I get home!

891
00:53:29,457 --> 00:53:30,685
He wants to
talk to you.

892
00:53:30,759 --> 00:53:33,523
Mom! I don't
want to!

893
00:53:33,595 --> 00:53:37,429
<i>No, Mom. No, Mom,
I don't want tol</i>

894
00:53:37,499 --> 00:53:39,160
<i>Nol Mom I</i>

895
00:53:39,234 --> 00:53:40,258
Hello?

896
00:53:46,741 --> 00:53:49,175
Welcome home, chum!

897
00:53:49,244 --> 00:53:51,610
Sorry to spring
this on you, chum.

898
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,409
I bet the last thing
you need right now

899
00:53:53,481 --> 00:53:58,248
is your old man back home
fouling everything up.

900
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,584
Don't be silly, Dad.

901
00:54:00,655 --> 00:54:03,590
You being home is just about
the best news in the world.

902
00:54:03,658 --> 00:54:06,092
Hell, man, I'm happy
to be out of that place.

903
00:54:06,161 --> 00:54:09,187
I bet you are.

904
00:54:09,264 --> 00:54:12,097
Bloody depressing there with everybody
going on about their aliments, hey.

905
00:54:12,167 --> 00:54:16,433
<i>Like a bunch
of old women.</i>

906
00:54:16,504 --> 00:54:19,268
So how you feeling?

907
00:54:19,341 --> 00:54:22,435
<i>Fighting fit, chum.</i>

908
00:54:22,510 --> 00:54:24,239
Good.

909
00:54:24,312 --> 00:54:27,873
<i>How're things
with you, pal?</i>

910
00:54:27,949 --> 00:54:30,884
Everything's just
hunky-dory on my side, Dad.

911
00:54:30,952 --> 00:54:34,718
<i>Good. So... what's up?</i>

912
00:54:34,789 --> 00:54:41,251
Oh, well... well,
to start with

913
00:54:41,329 --> 00:54:43,991
there's a nice pile of
comics for you on the counter.

914
00:54:44,065 --> 00:54:47,296
<i>Batman and Robin, Submariner...
just your cup of tea.</i>

915
00:54:47,369 --> 00:54:48,802
<i>Ahhh I</i>

916
00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:51,031
I'll bring them home.

917
00:54:51,106 --> 00:54:54,303
<i>Good. I've got some great
new jokes to tell you, chum.</i>

918
00:54:54,376 --> 00:54:56,810
Ja, sure, we'll spin
a few yarns tonight.

919
00:54:56,878 --> 00:54:57,810
<i>Ja.</i>

920
00:55:00,715 --> 00:55:03,013
That's for sure.

921
00:55:10,892 --> 00:55:13,326
All right then, chum, I'll
see you in a little while.

922
00:55:13,395 --> 00:55:14,987
You won't be late?

923
00:55:15,063 --> 00:55:18,328
No, I promise. I'll
come straight home.

924
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:22,962
<i>Okay, I'm handing you back
to the commanding officer.</i>

925
00:55:26,741 --> 00:55:29,005
Hally, now don't forget to
bring home Daddy's brandy.

926
00:55:29,077 --> 00:55:32,342
Yes, I'll put it in my bag
now, for God's sake. Bye.

927
00:55:36,518 --> 00:55:40,784
That sounded like
quite a bump, Hally.

928
00:55:42,857 --> 00:55:44,688
M ind your
own business, Sam.

929
00:55:44,759 --> 00:55:47,853
<i>I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to interfere.</i>

930
00:55:47,929 --> 00:55:51,330
<i>Shall we
carry on? Hally?</i>

931
00:55:51,399 --> 00:55:55,130
Boet Sam, tell him about when
they're giving out the cups.

932
00:55:55,203 --> 00:55:57,535
<i>Jal That's
another big moment.</i>

933
00:55:57,605 --> 00:56:01,200
<i>The presentation of the cups after
the winner has been announced.</i>

934
00:56:01,276 --> 00:56:03,301
<i>The presentation
of the cups.</i>

935
00:56:03,378 --> 00:56:09,749
<i>You've got to put that
in there, Master Hally.</i>

936
00:56:16,724 --> 00:56:20,057
So much for a bloody
world without collisions.

937
00:56:20,128 --> 00:56:21,993
We did say it
was only a dream.

938
00:56:22,063 --> 00:56:26,056
Life's a fick-up and it's
never going to change.

939
00:56:26,134 --> 00:56:27,396
Maybe that's true.

940
00:56:27,469 --> 00:56:29,232
There's no maybe about it.

941
00:56:29,304 --> 00:56:30,862
All we've done this
afternoon is waste our time.

942
00:56:30,939 --> 00:56:32,463
Not if we get
your homework done.

943
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:36,704
I don't give a shit
about my homework!

944
00:56:36,778 --> 00:56:38,336
Hurry up now and
finish your work.

945
00:56:38,413 --> 00:56:43,214
I want to lock up and get out of here.

946
00:56:43,284 --> 00:56:44,842
And go where?

947
00:56:44,919 --> 00:56:47,217
Home-sweet-freaking-home.

948
00:56:47,288 --> 00:56:49,518
Jesus, I hate that word.

949
00:57:02,337 --> 00:57:03,827
Do you want to know
what's really wrong

950
00:57:03,905 --> 00:57:06,237
with your lovely
little dream, Sam?

951
00:57:06,307 --> 00:57:08,366
It's not just that
we're all bad dancers

952
00:57:08,443 --> 00:57:10,377
there's more
to it than that.

953
00:57:10,445 --> 00:57:11,275
'Oause you left
out the cripples.

954
00:57:11,346 --> 00:57:13,371
Hally.

955
00:57:13,448 --> 00:57:15,541
<i>Jal Ja, they're also
out there dancing...</i>

956
00:57:15,617 --> 00:57:18,950
like a bunch of broken spiders
trying to do the quickstep.

957
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:20,749
<i>I mean it's bad
enough on two legs</i>

958
00:57:20,822 --> 00:57:22,790
<i>but one and a
pair of crutchesl</i>

959
00:57:22,857 --> 00:57:26,725
That's guaranteed to turn that
dance floor into a shambles.

960
00:57:26,794 --> 00:57:29,957
For once this afternoon let's use
our imaginations sensibly, right?

961
00:57:30,031 --> 00:57:32,465
There's no music, nobody knows the steps

962
00:57:32,534 --> 00:57:35,628
and the cripples are always out
there tripping everyone else up

963
00:57:35,703 --> 00:57:37,295
<i>and it's called
the All-Comers-</i>

964
00:57:37,372 --> 00:57:39,306
How-To-Make-a-Fickup-
of-Life Ohampionship.

965
00:57:39,374 --> 00:57:40,807
And guess who I think is
going to be this year's winner?

966
00:57:40,875 --> 00:57:42,433
<i>Now, Hally, stopl</i>

967
00:57:42,510 --> 00:57:43,238
That's your father
you're talking about.

968
00:57:43,311 --> 00:57:45,142
So?

969
00:57:45,213 --> 00:57:47,078
<i>Take back those words
and ask for forgivenessl</i>

970
00:57:47,148 --> 00:57:48,706
<i>It's a terrible sin
for a son</i>

971
00:57:48,783 --> 00:57:50,910
to mock his father
with jokes like that.

972
00:57:50,985 --> 00:57:53,613
<i>Hally, I understand how you
are feeling, but even so...</i>

973
00:57:53,688 --> 00:57:54,655
No, you don't!

974
00:57:54,722 --> 00:57:56,121
I think I do.

975
00:57:56,190 --> 00:57:58,158
And I'm telling
you you don't!

976
00:57:58,226 --> 00:57:59,215
Nobody does!

977
00:58:04,866 --> 00:58:08,802
It's your turn to be
careful, Sam. Very careful!

978
00:58:08,870 --> 00:58:10,997
Just leave me and
my father alone!

979
00:58:11,072 --> 00:58:13,666
I'm not the one saying
terrible things about him.

980
00:58:13,741 --> 00:58:16,175
<i>What goes on between me and my
dad is none of your businessl</i>

981
00:58:16,244 --> 00:58:18,007
Okay, then don't
tell me about it.

982
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:19,842
All that concerns
you in here, Sam

983
00:58:19,914 --> 00:58:21,973
is to try and do what
you get paid for.

984
00:58:22,050 --> 00:58:24,450
Keep the place clean
and serve the customers.

985
00:58:24,519 --> 00:58:26,510
My mother's
always warned me

986
00:58:26,588 --> 00:58:28,522
<i>about allowing you to
get too familiar.</i>

987
00:58:28,590 --> 00:58:29,989
<i>You're only
a servant in here</i>

988
00:58:30,058 --> 00:58:32,526
and don't forget it.

989
00:58:32,594 --> 00:58:34,357
<i>And as far as my
father's concerned</i>

990
00:58:34,429 --> 00:58:36,454
all you need to remember
is that he is your boss.

991
00:58:36,531 --> 00:58:38,522
No, he isn't. I get
paid by your mother.

992
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:41,262
He's a white man and
that's good enough for you.

993
00:58:47,275 --> 00:58:49,539
I'll try to forget
you said that.

994
00:58:49,611 --> 00:58:52,705
Don't.

995
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:55,044
Look, Hally...
You're right.

996
00:58:55,116 --> 00:58:57,812
If we're not careful,
somebody is going to get hurt.

997
00:58:57,885 --> 00:58:58,817
I don't know what
you're talking about.

998
00:58:58,886 --> 00:58:59,682
Yes, you do.

999
00:58:59,754 --> 00:59:01,187
Jesus!

1000
00:59:01,255 --> 00:59:02,654
I wish you'd stop
trying to tell me

1001
00:59:02,724 --> 00:59:04,316
what I do and
what I don't know.

1002
00:59:04,392 --> 00:59:05,723
Come, Willie,
let's finish up.

1003
00:59:05,793 --> 00:59:06,851
Don't turn your
back on me!

1004
00:59:06,928 --> 00:59:08,452
Don't do that!

1005
00:59:19,073 --> 00:59:21,405
All right.

1006
00:59:21,476 --> 00:59:25,810
I'm listening. What do
you want to say to me?

1007
00:59:30,018 --> 00:59:32,248
Well, to start with

1008
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:35,289
why don't you start
calling me Master Harold

1009
00:59:35,356 --> 00:59:36,516
like Willie.

1010
00:59:42,997 --> 00:59:44,555
Do you mean that?

1011
00:59:44,632 --> 00:59:47,601
Why the hell do you
think I said it?

1012
00:59:47,669 --> 00:59:49,034
If I don't?

1013
00:59:49,103 --> 00:59:54,769
You might just
lose your job.

1014
00:59:54,842 --> 00:59:57,936
If you make me
say it once

1015
00:59:58,012 --> 01:00:00,947
<i>I'll never call you
anything else again.</i>

1016
01:00:01,015 --> 01:00:03,245
So? Is that meant
to be a threat?

1017
01:00:03,317 --> 01:00:05,945
Just telling you
what will happen.

1018
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:08,511
You must decide
what it means to you.

1019
01:00:13,027 --> 01:00:15,962
Well, I have.

1020
01:00:16,030 --> 01:00:19,625
It's good news.

1021
01:00:19,701 --> 01:00:24,968
Because that's exactly what
Master Harold wants from now on.

1022
01:00:25,039 --> 01:00:27,633
<i>Think of it as a little
lesson in respect, Sam</i>

1023
01:00:27,709 --> 01:00:29,904
that's long overdue.

1024
01:00:29,977 --> 01:00:31,968
My dad agrees with my
mom, you know.

1025
01:00:32,046 --> 01:00:35,072
"You must teach the boys to
show you more respect, my son. "

1026
01:00:35,149 --> 01:00:37,777
So now you can stop
complaining about going home.

1027
01:00:37,852 --> 01:00:40,252
Everybody is going
to be happy tonight.

1028
01:00:40,321 --> 01:00:41,948
<i>That's perfectly correct.</i>

1029
01:00:42,023 --> 01:00:43,957
You see

1030
01:00:44,025 --> 01:00:46,084
You mustn't get the wrong
idea about me and my dad, Sam.

1031
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:47,991
We also have our
good times together.

1032
01:00:48,062 --> 01:00:50,997
Some bloody
good laughs.

1033
01:00:51,065 --> 01:00:54,000
Want to know what
our favorite joke is?

1034
01:00:54,068 --> 01:00:56,263
He gives out this big
groan, you see, and says

1035
01:00:56,337 --> 01:01:00,171
"Oh, it's not fair,
is it, Hally?"

1036
01:01:00,241 --> 01:01:02,505
Then I have to ask,
"What chum?"

1037
01:01:02,577 --> 01:01:06,069
And then he says,
"A kaffir's ass. "

1038
01:01:09,250 --> 01:01:10,877
We both have
a good laugh.

1039
01:01:19,427 --> 01:01:21,554
Oh, what's... what's
the matter, Willie?

1040
01:01:21,629 --> 01:01:23,859
Don't you catch
the joke?

1041
01:01:23,931 --> 01:01:25,455
It's what's
called a pun.

1042
01:01:25,533 --> 01:01:27,626
You see, fair means
both light in color

1043
01:01:27,702 --> 01:01:31,035
and to be just
and decent.

1044
01:01:31,105 --> 01:01:32,800
I thought you
would catch it, Sam.

1045
01:01:32,874 --> 01:01:34,501
I catch it all right.

1046
01:01:34,575 --> 01:01:37,339
But it doesn't appeal
to your sense of humor?

1047
01:01:37,411 --> 01:01:38,537
Do you really laugh?

1048
01:01:38,613 --> 01:01:41,207
Of course.

1049
01:01:41,282 --> 01:01:43,147
To please him? To
make him feel good?

1050
01:01:43,217 --> 01:01:44,946
No, for heaven's sake!

1051
01:01:45,019 --> 01:01:47,385
I laugh because I think
it's a bloody good joke.

1052
01:01:47,455 --> 01:01:50,049
<i>You're really trying hard
to be ugly, aren't you?</i>

1053
01:01:50,124 --> 01:01:52,217
<i>And why drag poor Willie into it?</i>

1054
01:01:52,293 --> 01:01:54,227
<i>He's done nothing but
show you the respect</i>

1055
01:01:54,295 --> 01:01:56,354
<i>that you want so badly.</i>

1056
01:01:56,430 --> 01:01:58,523
<i>And that also is not "fair"</i>

1057
01:01:58,599 --> 01:02:00,863
and this time I mean
just or decent.

1058
01:02:00,935 --> 01:02:02,903
Sam, It's all right.
Leave it now.

1059
01:02:02,970 --> 01:02:04,904
Why didn't you just
say "Sam's ass"?

1060
01:02:04,972 --> 01:02:07,566
<i>That's the ass you're
trying to kick.</i>

1061
01:02:07,642 --> 01:02:11,408
Anyway, how do you
know it's not fair?

1062
01:02:11,479 --> 01:02:14,915
<i>You've never seen it.</i>

1063
01:02:14,982 --> 01:02:16,449
Do you want to?

1064
01:02:32,333 --> 01:02:36,133
<i>There. Have
a good look.</i>

1065
01:02:36,204 --> 01:02:40,641
<i>A real Basuto ass.</i>

1066
01:02:40,708 --> 01:02:44,144
<i>Look at my assl</i>

1067
01:02:44,212 --> 01:02:47,477
<i>Satisfied?</i>

1068
01:02:47,548 --> 01:02:51,143
Now you can make
your dad even happier.

1069
01:02:51,219 --> 01:02:55,553
Tell him I showed you my
ass and yes, he is right.

1070
01:02:55,623 --> 01:03:01,493
It's not fair.

1071
01:03:01,562 --> 01:03:04,725
Come, Willie,
let's finish up.

1072
01:03:04,799 --> 01:03:06,391
Sam...

1073
01:03:09,737 --> 01:03:11,671
<i>Leave it, Boet Sam.</i>

1074
01:03:16,644 --> 01:03:21,513
It's all right, Willie.

1075
01:03:21,582 --> 01:03:23,413
Well, you've done it...

1076
01:03:30,258 --> 01:03:32,158
Master... Harold.

1077
01:03:35,496 --> 01:03:37,521
<i>I'll start calling
you that from now on.</i>

1078
01:03:37,598 --> 01:03:41,625
<i>It won't be
difficult anymore.</i>

1079
01:03:41,702 --> 01:03:45,365
<i>You just hurt yourself.</i>

1080
01:03:45,439 --> 01:03:47,839
I saw it coming

1081
01:03:47,909 --> 01:03:50,707
I tried to warn you,
but you wouldn't listen.

1082
01:03:50,778 --> 01:03:54,680
<i>So now you just
hurt yourself bad.</i>

1083
01:03:54,749 --> 01:03:58,310
And you're a coward,
Master Harold.

1084
01:03:58,386 --> 01:04:01,219
The face you should be
spitting in is your father's

1085
01:04:01,289 --> 01:04:04,383
<i>but you used mine, because
you think you are safe</i>

1086
01:04:04,458 --> 01:04:05,720
<i>inside your fair skin I</i>

1087
01:04:07,762 --> 01:04:08,456
<i>No, Boet Sam.</i>

1088
01:04:28,382 --> 01:04:32,512
<i>You don't know all of
what you've just done...</i>

1089
01:04:32,586 --> 01:04:36,579
<i>Master Harold.</i>

1090
01:04:36,657 --> 01:04:39,057
Not only have you made
me feel dirtier

1091
01:04:39,126 --> 01:04:44,063
than ever I've ever
been in my life.

1092
01:04:44,131 --> 01:04:48,727
But how do I wash off yours
and your father's filth?

1093
01:04:52,974 --> 01:04:58,241
<i>A long time ago I made
a promise to myself</i>

1094
01:04:58,312 --> 01:05:01,338
but you've just shown
me, Master Harold...

1095
01:05:01,415 --> 01:05:02,473
I've failed.

1096
01:05:11,993 --> 01:05:16,259
I've also got
a memory...

1097
01:05:16,330 --> 01:05:23,259
of a little white boy in
short trousers and a black man

1098
01:05:23,337 --> 01:05:27,273
but they were
not flying a kite.

1099
01:05:27,341 --> 01:05:29,206
It was the old
J ubilee days

1100
01:05:29,276 --> 01:05:31,938
after dinner one night.

1101
01:05:32,013 --> 01:05:35,540
<i>You came into my room
and stood against the wall</i>

1102
01:05:35,616 --> 01:05:37,584
<i>looking down
at the ground.</i>

1103
01:05:43,691 --> 01:05:45,352
Ahh.

1104
01:05:48,829 --> 01:05:50,558
What is it, Hally?

1105
01:05:50,631 --> 01:05:52,690
<i>And only after
I'd asked you</i>

1106
01:05:52,767 --> 01:05:56,931
<i>I don't know how many
times, "What do you want?"...</i>

1107
01:05:57,004 --> 01:05:59,768
Hally, what's wrong?

1108
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:02,138
<i>...did you finally speak</i>

1109
01:06:02,209 --> 01:06:05,610
<i>and so soft I could
barely hear you.</i>

1110
01:06:05,679 --> 01:06:07,613
Come now.

1111
01:06:07,681 --> 01:06:15,816
<i>"Sam, please help
me fetch my Dad. "</i>

1112
01:06:15,890 --> 01:06:20,293
Do you remember?

1113
01:06:20,361 --> 01:06:25,822
He was dead drunk on the
floor of the Oentral Hotel Bar.

1114
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:28,562
<i>They phoned your mother, but
you were the only one home.</i>

1115
01:06:31,572 --> 01:06:33,631
<i>You went in first</i>

1116
01:06:33,707 --> 01:06:39,145
<i>and asked permission for me to go in.</i>

1117
01:06:55,596 --> 01:06:57,962
<i>Wat soek jy hier?</i>

1118
01:06:58,032 --> 01:07:00,933
<i>You better take
him home, he's pissed himself.</i>

1119
01:07:03,237 --> 01:07:11,667
<i>You mean, pissed again.</i>

1120
01:07:11,745 --> 01:07:13,110
Come, Mr. Ballard.

1121
01:07:16,083 --> 01:07:18,381
<i>I loaded your dad on my back</i>

1122
01:07:18,452 --> 01:07:20,420
<i>and I carried
him like a baby.</i>

1123
01:07:36,137 --> 01:07:37,604
Poor thing.

1124
01:07:41,142 --> 01:07:42,905
<i>What a disgrace.</i>

1125
01:08:27,488 --> 01:08:29,115
Get me some water
from the basement.

1126
01:08:30,691 --> 01:08:32,249
<i>We have to
clean him up.</i>

1127
01:08:32,326 --> 01:08:34,453
Don't let them take
my other leg, Hally.

1128
01:08:34,528 --> 01:08:37,497
Promise, you won't let
them take my other leg?

1129
01:08:37,565 --> 01:08:38,759
I won't.

1130
01:08:54,548 --> 01:08:57,415
<i>I felt for that little boy...</i>

1131
01:08:57,484 --> 01:09:01,818
<i>Master Harold.</i>

1132
01:09:01,889 --> 01:09:12,322
<i>I felt for him.</i>

1133
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:16,802
I love him, Sam.

1134
01:09:16,870 --> 01:09:19,498
<i>I know you do.</i>

1135
01:09:19,573 --> 01:09:23,942
<i>That's why I tried to stop
you from saying those things.</i>

1136
01:09:24,011 --> 01:09:29,347
You love him... but you
are ashamed of him.

1137
01:09:29,416 --> 01:09:32,317
You are ashamed
of so much!

1138
01:09:32,386 --> 01:09:37,323
<i>And now that's going
to include yourself.</i>

1139
01:09:37,391 --> 01:09:40,292
<i>That's the promise
that I made to myself</i>

1140
01:09:40,361 --> 01:09:44,024
<i>to try to stop that
from happening.</i>

1141
01:09:44,098 --> 01:09:46,692
You didn't do anything wrong,

1142
01:09:46,767 --> 01:09:48,860
but for days you went around,

1143
01:09:48,936 --> 01:09:50,631
as if you owed the world an apology,

1144
01:09:50,704 --> 01:09:53,195
for being alive.

1145
01:09:53,274 --> 01:09:56,539
I didn't like seeing that.

1146
01:09:56,610 --> 01:10:00,842
That's not the way a
boy grows up to be a man!

1147
01:10:00,914 --> 01:10:04,315
<i>But the one who should
have been teaching you</i>

1148
01:10:04,385 --> 01:10:08,879
<i>what it means was the
cause of your shame.</i>

1149
01:10:08,956 --> 01:10:11,322
<i>And if you really
want to know</i>

1150
01:10:11,392 --> 01:10:15,852
<i>that's why I made
you that kite.</i>

1151
01:10:15,929 --> 01:10:20,389
I wanted you to look up

1152
01:10:20,467 --> 01:10:24,665
to be proud
of something

1153
01:10:24,738 --> 01:10:28,572
of yourself...

1154
01:10:28,642 --> 01:10:31,338
<i>and you certainly were that
when I left you up there</i>

1155
01:10:31,412 --> 01:10:33,903
<i>on the hill
with the kite.</i>

1156
01:10:37,985 --> 01:10:41,580
<i>Something elsel</i>

1157
01:10:41,655 --> 01:10:45,250
If you ever do write
a short story about it

1158
01:10:45,326 --> 01:10:49,592
there was a
twist in the ending.

1159
01:10:49,663 --> 01:10:53,929
<i>I couldn't sit and
stay there with you.</i>

1160
01:10:54,001 --> 01:10:58,870
<i>It was a
"White's Only" bench.</i>

1161
01:10:58,939 --> 01:11:04,605
<i>You were too young,
too excited to notice.</i>

1162
01:11:04,678 --> 01:11:08,375
<i>But not anymore.</i>

1163
01:11:08,449 --> 01:11:13,785
<i>And if you're not careful,
"Master Harold... "</i>

1164
01:11:13,854 --> 01:11:17,551
you will be sitting up there by yourself,

1165
01:11:17,624 --> 01:11:22,288
for a long time to come,

1166
01:11:22,363 --> 01:11:25,355
and there won't be a kite in the sky.

1167
01:11:52,559 --> 01:11:57,758
Willie...

1168
01:11:57,831 --> 01:12:02,165
Will you lock up for me
and look after the keys?

1169
01:12:02,236 --> 01:12:03,567
Okay.

1170
01:12:32,266 --> 01:12:34,257
You forgot the comics.

1171
01:13:11,438 --> 01:13:15,670
Hally...

1172
01:13:15,742 --> 01:13:18,540
I've got no right to tell
you what it is to be a man

1173
01:13:18,612 --> 01:13:23,208
if I don't behave
like one myself.

1174
01:13:23,283 --> 01:13:26,719
Should we try again?

1175
01:13:26,787 --> 01:13:29,551
Try what?

1176
01:13:29,623 --> 01:13:32,558
Fly another kite,
I suppose.

1177
01:13:32,626 --> 01:13:35,026
You can't fly kites
on rainy days, remember?

1178
01:13:35,095 --> 01:13:37,086
So what do we do?

1179
01:13:37,164 --> 01:13:40,759
Hope for better
weather tomorrow?

1180
01:13:40,834 --> 01:13:42,893
I don't know.

1181
01:13:42,970 --> 01:13:44,528
I don't know
anything anymore.

1182
01:13:44,605 --> 01:13:48,439
You sure of that, Hally?

1183
01:13:48,509 --> 01:13:53,378
Because it would be pretty
hopeless if that were true.

1184
01:13:53,447 --> 01:13:56,439
Anyway, I don't believe you.

1185
01:13:56,517 --> 01:14:00,578
I reckon there's
one thing you know.

1186
01:14:00,654 --> 01:14:04,613
You don't have to sit
up there by yourself.

1187
01:14:04,691 --> 01:14:08,092
You know what
that bench means now.

1188
01:14:08,161 --> 01:14:11,619
And all you have
to do is stand up...

1189
01:14:11,698 --> 01:14:13,359
and walk away from it.

1190
01:14:38,358 --> 01:14:39,882
Come inside, Boet Sam.

1191
01:14:42,896 --> 01:14:44,557
It's going to be
okay tomorrow.

1192
01:15:27,274 --> 01:15:29,367
Boet Sam, you're right.

1193
01:15:29,443 --> 01:15:33,675
I think about it
and you're right.

1194
01:15:33,747 --> 01:15:36,875
Tonight I find Hilda
and say I'm sorry.

1195
01:15:36,950 --> 01:15:41,387
And promise not to
beat her no more.

1196
01:15:41,455 --> 01:15:43,821
You hear me, Boet Sam?

1197
01:15:43,890 --> 01:15:45,551
I hear you, Willie.

1198
01:15:45,626 --> 01:15:47,719
Then we practice.

1199
01:15:47,794 --> 01:15:51,525
Then I relax and romance with
her from beginning to end.

1200
01:15:51,598 --> 01:15:54,999
Non-stop!
You watch, Boet Sam!

1201
01:15:55,068 --> 01:15:59,232
Two weeks' time, "First
prize for promising newcomers

1202
01:15:59,306 --> 01:16:04,471
Mr. Willie Malopo
and Miss Hilda Samuels. "

1203
01:16:38,011 --> 01:16:41,777
How did you
say it, Boet Sam?

1204
01:16:41,848 --> 01:16:43,179
Let's dream.

1205
01:16:52,859 --> 01:16:55,453
You lead, I follow.
