1
00:01:32,893 --> 00:01:34,156
- Mr. Vale.
- Yes.

2
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:35,526
I'm Barbara Watson.

3
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:36,529
Yes. Come in.

4
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:37,587
Thank you.

5
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,590
Hmm.

6
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:44,300
Ah. May I take your coat?

7
00:01:44,372 --> 00:01:45,534
No, thank you.

8
00:01:45,607 --> 00:01:46,540
Uh...

9
00:01:46,608 --> 00:01:48,338
would you like something to drink?

10
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:49,400
No.

11
00:01:51,446 --> 00:01:52,539
Shall we get started?

12
00:01:52,614 --> 00:01:53,604
Uh, okay.

13
00:02:06,462 --> 00:02:08,227
Let's try it again.

14
00:02:08,297 --> 00:02:09,560
The same thing?

15
00:02:09,632 --> 00:02:11,226
Yes.

16
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,893
And remember...

17
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:15,270
fingers curved like a tunnel.

18
00:02:15,338 --> 00:02:16,328
Okay.

19
00:02:24,982 --> 00:02:26,143
Don't flatten.

20
00:02:27,651 --> 00:02:29,951
Make room for the train.

21
00:02:31,022 --> 00:02:32,012
What?

22
00:02:33,091 --> 00:02:34,582
It's something I tell my kids.

23
00:02:34,658 --> 00:02:38,599
If the fingers are curved, like this,

24
00:02:38,663 --> 00:02:42,660
then there's room for the train
to pass through the tunnel.

25
00:02:47,338 --> 00:02:48,932
Thank you.

26
00:02:49,008 --> 00:02:50,601
Uh, next Tuesday, then, same time?

27
00:02:50,675 --> 00:02:54,616
No. Uh, I don't think
I'm going to continue with our lessons.

28
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,909
Oh, no.

29
00:02:57,116 --> 00:02:58,106
You're giving up?

30
00:02:59,118 --> 00:03:00,246
No.

31
00:03:01,687 --> 00:03:03,281
Oh.

32
00:03:03,355 --> 00:03:04,948
Okay.

33
00:03:05,025 --> 00:03:06,050
Well...

34
00:03:06,126 --> 00:03:07,059
good-bye.

35
00:03:07,127 --> 00:03:08,356
Good-bye.

36
00:03:10,196 --> 00:03:11,631
Uh, Mr. Vale.

37
00:03:11,698 --> 00:03:12,631
May I ask?

38
00:03:12,699 --> 00:03:15,432
How many teachers
have you had before me?

39
00:03:17,037 --> 00:03:17,970
Four.

40
00:03:18,038 --> 00:03:19,268
Well, for what it's worth,

41
00:03:19,339 --> 00:03:22,641
learning an instrument
at your age is difficult,

42
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:27,515
especially if you don't possess
a natural gift for it.

43
00:03:27,581 --> 00:03:30,018
I'm not saying this to be mean.

44
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:36,724
But if you do decide to give up,
I'd really like to buy your piano.

45
00:03:38,726 --> 00:03:39,716
Okay.

46
00:03:52,407 --> 00:03:55,003
Each stage of experience
is really the exception to the rule

47
00:03:55,078 --> 00:03:56,478
because the conditions there

48
00:03:56,545 --> 00:04:00,679
that made trade mobilization
to the Middle East successful

49
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,745
weren't present
in the developing countries.

50
00:04:09,726 --> 00:04:10,716
Yes?

51
00:04:13,097 --> 00:04:14,122
Hi.

52
00:04:14,198 --> 00:04:15,496
Come in.

53
00:04:26,443 --> 00:04:29,039
Paper. Uh, sorry it's late.

54
00:04:30,281 --> 00:04:31,271
Why is it late?

55
00:04:32,316 --> 00:04:34,787
I had some personal
issues to deal with.

56
00:04:38,123 --> 00:04:40,218
I'm sorry, but I can't accept it now.

57
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,723
I mean, I... I really had a...

58
00:04:43,795 --> 00:04:44,785
I'm sorry.

59
00:04:58,477 --> 00:05:02,417
Uh, you know you still haven't given us
the syllabus yet?

60
00:05:02,481 --> 00:05:03,813
I know.

61
00:05:39,188 --> 00:05:40,850
Yeah?

62
00:05:42,191 --> 00:05:43,216
Hello, Walter.

63
00:05:43,292 --> 00:05:44,225
Hi, Charles.

64
00:05:44,293 --> 00:05:45,386
You got a sec?

65
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,485
Sure.

66
00:05:47,596 --> 00:05:48,791
Walter, Shelley can't make it down

67
00:05:48,864 --> 00:05:50,800
to the NYU conference
to present your paper.

68
00:05:50,866 --> 00:05:52,631
I'm gonna need you to cover for her.

69
00:05:52,801 --> 00:05:54,498
Why can't she go?

70
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:57,599
She's been put on bed rest
till she has the baby.

71
00:05:57,673 --> 00:06:00,804
I wish I could, but now is not
a good time, Charles.

72
00:06:00,877 --> 00:06:03,473
Well, I understand,
but you co-authored the paper,

73
00:06:03,545 --> 00:06:04,604
and the Dean wants it presented.

74
00:06:04,681 --> 00:06:05,979
He wants to keep
Shelley on track for tenure.

75
00:06:06,249 --> 00:06:09,416
I just don't think I can,
with the start of classes and my book.

76
00:06:10,487 --> 00:06:12,889
You're only teaching one class, Walter.

77
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:14,983
So I can stay focused on my book.

78
00:06:17,995 --> 00:06:19,691
Charles, I would really rather not go.

79
00:06:19,764 --> 00:06:23,328
Well, I'm sorry, but there really
isn't another option at this point.

80
00:06:27,838 --> 00:06:29,933
Charles, the truth is...

81
00:06:30,007 --> 00:06:31,874
this is really Shelley's paper.

82
00:06:31,942 --> 00:06:35,006
I just agreed to co-author it
because she asked me to.

83
00:06:36,681 --> 00:06:39,016
I'm not really prepared to present it.

84
00:06:40,018 --> 00:06:41,316
Now, look, Walter,
you can take it up

85
00:06:41,386 --> 00:06:42,548
with the Dean if you want,

86
00:06:42,621 --> 00:06:47,028
but as your friend, I wouldn't advise it,
not with that argument.

87
00:08:58,665 --> 00:08:59,655
Hello?

88
00:09:59,996 --> 00:10:01,659
Aah! Aah! Aah! Get out!

89
00:10:01,731 --> 00:10:04,100
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Get out!

90
00:10:04,167 --> 00:10:05,157
You stay away from me!

91
00:10:05,235 --> 00:10:07,068
You leave me alone!

92
00:10:07,137 --> 00:10:09,004
No. I... It's... It's okay. I... I'm...

93
00:10:09,072 --> 00:10:10,507
It's not okay! My boyfriend is coming!

94
00:10:10,575 --> 00:10:12,511
I'm... I'm... I'm not going to hurt you.

95
00:10:12,577 --> 00:10:14,604
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

96
00:10:14,678 --> 00:10:16,078
This is my apartment.

97
00:10:16,147 --> 00:10:17,638
This apartment does
not belong to you!

98
00:10:17,714 --> 00:10:19,513
- How did you get in here?
- My name is Walter Vale.

99
00:10:19,584 --> 00:10:21,577
- I have keys! This is my apartment!
- What the fuck!

100
00:10:21,652 --> 00:10:23,885
Ow! Ow! God! Aah! Please!

101
00:10:23,955 --> 00:10:25,184
- Zainab!
- I'm in here!

102
00:10:25,256 --> 00:10:26,691
- Shut up!
- Aah!

103
00:10:26,758 --> 00:10:28,489
- Shut up!
- All ri... Okay. Okay.

104
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,619
Okay. Okay.

105
00:10:29,694 --> 00:10:30,719
Who are you?

106
00:10:30,795 --> 00:10:31,990
<i>Qu'est-ce que c'est ça?</i>

107
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,191
<i>Ça va?</i>

108
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:34,198
<i>Oui, ça va.</i>

109
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:35,199
<i>C'est qui?</i>

110
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:36,530
<i>J'étais dans mon bain.</i>

111
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:37,661
<i>Lui, il était là.</i>

112
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:39,764
- Did you touch her?
- What?

113
00:10:39,838 --> 00:10:41,033
- Motherfucker, did you touch her?
- No! No! No!

114
00:10:41,106 --> 00:10:42,574
<i>Il ne m'a pas touchée.</i>

115
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,839
<i>Mais comme il est entré,</i>
<i>il a dit qu'il avait la clé.</i>

116
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,539
Do you have keys?

117
00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:48,206
Yes, of course I have keys.
This is my apartment.

118
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:50,545
- Show me your keys.
- All right.

119
00:10:50,617 --> 00:10:51,812
Here.

120
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:53,217
I've had this apartment for 25 years.

121
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:54,720
So why haven't you been here?

122
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:57,623
Because I live in Connecticut.
I haven't been down here in a very long time.

123
00:10:58,625 --> 00:10:59,753
Are you friends with Ivan?

124
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:01,625
Ivan. I don't... Who's Ivan?

125
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:05,289
I'm sure he's called the police!

126
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,064
- Did you call the police?
- No.

127
00:11:08,135 --> 00:11:09,967
- You did not call the police?
- No.

128
00:11:14,141 --> 00:11:15,234
And you don't know Ivan?

129
00:11:15,309 --> 00:11:16,744
No. Who is he?

130
00:11:16,811 --> 00:11:18,245
- He rented us this place.
- I don't know him.

131
00:11:18,312 --> 00:11:20,943
He said it belongs
to his friend who is out of town.

132
00:11:21,015 --> 00:11:22,005
I don't know who he is.

133
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:23,814
This is my apartment. I assure you.

134
00:11:26,655 --> 00:11:28,056
Shit!

135
00:11:28,123 --> 00:11:30,320
<i>Je t'ai déjà dit</i>
<i>de faire confiance à personne.</i>

136
00:11:30,592 --> 00:11:32,118
<i>T'as jamais signé</i>
<i>un contrat.</i>

137
00:11:36,331 --> 00:11:37,264
Shit.

138
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:39,323
Hey, look.

139
00:11:42,003 --> 00:11:44,099
We don't want any trouble.

140
00:11:44,173 --> 00:11:45,835
We will get out of your apartment.

141
00:11:48,177 --> 00:11:50,079
Here. Take your keys.

142
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,774
It's all a mistake. I'm sorry.

143
00:11:52,849 --> 00:11:53,782
Okay.

144
00:11:54,851 --> 00:11:55,784
We will leave. Okay?

145
00:11:55,852 --> 00:11:57,344
Yeah, okay.

146
00:12:15,707 --> 00:12:17,005
How long have you lived here?

147
00:12:17,074 --> 00:12:18,771
Two months.

148
00:12:18,842 --> 00:12:20,368
We will pay you if you want.

149
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:27,244
Yes, so, uh, we will go.

150
00:12:27,318 --> 00:12:28,981
I'm sorry, again.

151
00:12:29,054 --> 00:12:30,386
Thank you for understanding.

152
00:12:38,964 --> 00:12:39,954
Go get the valise.

153
00:12:41,667 --> 00:12:42,657
Okay, okay.

154
00:12:46,238 --> 00:12:47,206
Good-bye.

155
00:12:47,273 --> 00:12:48,401
Good-bye.

156
00:13:45,301 --> 00:13:46,394
Tarek.

157
00:13:46,469 --> 00:13:47,961
- Tarek.
- What?

158
00:13:52,475 --> 00:13:54,969
Uh... you left this in the apartment.

159
00:13:55,979 --> 00:13:56,969
Thanks.

160
00:14:02,152 --> 00:14:03,745
So you know where
you're staying tonight?

161
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:08,153
Yeah, sure. We're goin' to some friends'.

162
00:14:31,517 --> 00:14:33,453
You like classical music, huh?

163
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,421
Yes.

164
00:14:35,488 --> 00:14:36,956
Me, too.

165
00:14:37,022 --> 00:14:38,150
Do you play the piano?

166
00:14:38,224 --> 00:14:39,989
No.

167
00:14:40,059 --> 00:14:40,992
Do you?

168
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,793
Me? No. I play the djembe.

169
00:14:44,798 --> 00:14:45,526
Hmm.

170
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:47,860
Okay. Good night.

171
00:14:49,035 --> 00:14:51,973
And thanks again for letting us stay.

172
00:14:52,038 --> 00:14:55,102
Um... you saved me a lot of trouble,
if you know what I mean.

173
00:14:55,175 --> 00:14:58,807
We'll be out of your way
in a couple of days. Okay?

174
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,314
Good night.

175
00:15:23,237 --> 00:15:24,501
Good morning.

176
00:15:24,573 --> 00:15:25,563
Good morning.

177
00:15:27,576 --> 00:15:29,512
I made some coffee.

178
00:15:29,578 --> 00:15:30,568
Thank you.

179
00:15:31,914 --> 00:15:36,356
And... have a good day.

180
00:15:36,418 --> 00:15:37,408
Good-bye.

181
00:15:50,266 --> 00:15:51,495
Walter Vale.

182
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:56,529
Thank you.

183
00:15:56,607 --> 00:15:58,440
And that will be on the last day
of the conference.

184
00:15:58,509 --> 00:16:00,205
I hope you can all attend.

185
00:16:00,277 --> 00:16:03,546
And now I'd like to welcome
my distinguished colleague

186
00:16:03,614 --> 00:16:05,846
and the winner
of the John Bates Clark Award...

187
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:07,613
Professor Stephen Kriegman.

188
00:16:17,429 --> 00:16:18,419
Thank you, Shiva.

189
00:16:39,318 --> 00:16:40,251
Thank you.

190
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,253
Excuse me.

191
00:16:41,321 --> 00:16:42,254
Yes?

192
00:16:42,321 --> 00:16:43,254
Mr. Vale?

193
00:16:43,322 --> 00:16:44,415
Yes.

194
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:47,428
Oh, my goodness. How are you?

195
00:16:47,493 --> 00:16:48,928
It's me.

196
00:16:48,996 --> 00:16:51,262
Jacob Koningsberg.
Do you remember me?

197
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:53,494
- I'm sorry.
I... I used to live on the third floor

198
00:16:53,567 --> 00:16:56,003
- with my mother.
Your wife used to give me piano lessons.

199
00:16:57,004 --> 00:16:58,598
Oh, right, right.

200
00:16:58,672 --> 00:17:00,608
How are you?

201
00:17:00,674 --> 00:17:02,610
Oh, my goodness.
I haven't seen you in so long.

202
00:17:02,676 --> 00:17:04,613
We thought that you
sold the place.

203
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:05,612
You haven't met Sprinkles.

204
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,445
This is Sprinkles. Say hello.

205
00:17:07,515 --> 00:17:08,676
Hello. How is your wife?

206
00:17:10,018 --> 00:17:11,612
Oh, my wife passed away.

207
00:17:13,188 --> 00:17:14,520
Oh, I'm sorry.

208
00:17:16,025 --> 00:17:19,327
I'm very sorry.
My... My condolences to you.

209
00:17:19,394 --> 00:17:21,023
She was a lovely woman.

210
00:17:21,097 --> 00:17:24,502
Honestly, I could
listen to her play piano for hours.

211
00:17:24,567 --> 00:17:25,660
How is your mother?

212
00:17:26,702 --> 00:17:29,104
My mother is fine.
Thank you very much.

213
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:31,164
Thank you for asking. She's in Florida.

214
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,642
So I'm living alone now, and it's nice,

215
00:17:33,709 --> 00:17:36,647
but I tell you, there are so many
new people in this building,

216
00:17:36,712 --> 00:17:39,445
- and Mr. Sprinkles and I...
- It's nice to see you again, Jacob.

217
00:17:40,449 --> 00:17:41,474
It's good to see you.

218
00:17:41,551 --> 00:17:42,712
Good to see you. Welcome home.

219
00:17:42,986 --> 00:17:44,249
Thank you.

220
00:17:44,321 --> 00:17:45,550
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

221
00:17:56,734 --> 00:17:58,100
Stop it.

222
00:17:58,168 --> 00:17:59,329
Come on, honey.

223
00:18:08,746 --> 00:18:10,375
We find that,
under these circumstances,

224
00:18:10,448 --> 00:18:13,181
financial globalization
can be beneficial.

225
00:18:13,251 --> 00:18:16,314
Empirically, it's good institution
and quality of government

226
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:18,517
that will allow third world countries

227
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,753
to benefit and harvest
the fruits of globalization.

228
00:19:09,144 --> 00:19:10,738
Great stuff, huh?

229
00:19:10,812 --> 00:19:12,805
Maybe we should have 'em
come play inside.

230
00:19:14,316 --> 00:19:15,716
Uh, you coming?

231
00:19:15,784 --> 00:19:18,085
In a minute. Uh, I gotta make a call.

232
00:19:18,154 --> 00:19:19,747
- Oh. Uh, see you inside.
- Okay.

233
00:19:43,847 --> 00:19:45,578
- ##
- Hey, Walter.

234
00:19:45,649 --> 00:19:46,776
Welcome home.

235
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:47,840
Hi.

236
00:19:51,855 --> 00:19:53,085
How was the conference?

237
00:19:53,157 --> 00:19:54,682
It was fine.

238
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,796
Sorry about the pants. I...

239
00:19:57,862 --> 00:19:59,855
I've been practicing
like this since I was a kid.

240
00:20:07,872 --> 00:20:09,808
You... You don't have
to stop practicing.

241
00:20:09,874 --> 00:20:12,175
Really? it won't bother you?

242
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:14,578
- No. It's fine.
- Great.

243
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,884
Hey, uh, Zainab's going to make dinner,

244
00:20:25,158 --> 00:20:26,888
if you want to eat with us later.

245
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:29,722
Okay. Thank you.

246
00:20:44,544 --> 00:20:46,845
I'm sorry.
That was my mother in Michigan.

247
00:20:46,914 --> 00:20:50,854
If I don't call her every day,
she thinks something happened to me.

248
00:20:50,918 --> 00:20:52,581
Yeah, I'll have a bit. Thanks.

249
00:20:53,588 --> 00:20:54,783
You sure you won't have some?

250
00:20:54,855 --> 00:20:55,914
I don't drink.

251
00:20:57,158 --> 00:20:59,391
She's a good Muslim. I'm a bad one.

252
00:21:00,595 --> 00:21:01,858
Are you finished?

253
00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:03,866
Yes. Uh... can I help you?

254
00:21:03,932 --> 00:21:06,870
No. Please.
It's the least I can do.

255
00:21:06,935 --> 00:21:09,269
Well, thank you for dinner.
It was very good.

256
00:21:09,338 --> 00:21:10,932
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

257
00:21:12,774 --> 00:21:14,710
So what's the conference about?

258
00:21:14,776 --> 00:21:16,871
Economic growth
in developing nations.

259
00:21:16,945 --> 00:21:19,678
That's us. Syria, Senegal.

260
00:21:21,783 --> 00:21:22,877
So have you written some books?

261
00:21:22,952 --> 00:21:24,888
Three, and I'm working on a fourth.

262
00:21:24,954 --> 00:21:26,548
- Four books.
- Mm-hmm.

263
00:21:26,622 --> 00:21:28,854
Wow. That's great.

264
00:21:30,626 --> 00:21:32,892
My father was a writer. A journalist.

265
00:21:32,962 --> 00:21:34,522
Is he still writing?

266
00:21:34,597 --> 00:21:38,662
No. He died before we left Syria,
almost nine years ago.

267
00:21:38,735 --> 00:21:39,725
Sorry.

268
00:21:40,738 --> 00:21:42,229
Me, too.

269
00:21:42,306 --> 00:21:43,673
- Tarek.
- Mmm.

270
00:21:44,975 --> 00:21:47,572
Mmm. We have to go.

271
00:21:47,644 --> 00:21:48,873
I have a gig.

272
00:21:51,316 --> 00:21:52,909
Walter, you can come if you want.

273
00:21:52,983 --> 00:21:55,682
Oh, no. I've got some work
I have to get done. Thank you.

274
00:21:55,753 --> 00:21:57,620
Okay. Well, maybe another time.

275
00:21:57,688 --> 00:21:58,679
Okay.

276
00:22:01,326 --> 00:22:02,989
- Bye.
- Good-bye.

277
00:22:17,677 --> 00:22:20,444
You know, you are very sexy
when you're mad at me.

278
00:22:25,518 --> 00:22:26,508
Hello?

279
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,683
If you don't mind, I think I will come.

280
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:33,452
Cool.

281
00:22:33,526 --> 00:22:34,859
Let me get my coat.

282
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,050
Hohh!

283
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:18,901
He's very good.

284
00:23:19,908 --> 00:23:20,898
Yes.

285
00:23:21,911 --> 00:23:24,074
- The whole band's very good.
- Yes.

286
00:23:32,922 --> 00:23:34,551
I'm sorry, guys.

287
00:23:34,624 --> 00:23:35,557
Yeah, well, let's go.

288
00:23:35,625 --> 00:23:37,026
Very good.

289
00:23:37,094 --> 00:23:38,027
Really? You liked it?

290
00:23:38,095 --> 00:23:39,028
Yeah. It was very good.

291
00:23:39,096 --> 00:23:40,359
I was not sure.

292
00:23:40,431 --> 00:23:42,594
I thought it's too loud and you know.

293
00:24:24,977 --> 00:24:26,138
Tarek?

294
00:24:41,161 --> 00:24:42,094
Oh.

295
00:24:42,162 --> 00:24:43,927
Hi.

296
00:24:43,997 --> 00:24:45,933
Sounded good, Walter.

297
00:24:45,999 --> 00:24:47,093
I'm sorry. I...

298
00:24:47,168 --> 00:24:48,761
No. Don't be sorry.

299
00:24:48,836 --> 00:24:50,169
That's what it's there for.

300
00:24:51,506 --> 00:24:52,907
I was lying

301
00:24:52,974 --> 00:24:54,033
on my bed, listening to my music,

302
00:24:54,108 --> 00:24:55,771
and then I was, like...

303
00:24:55,844 --> 00:24:57,438
what's that crazy rhythm I'm hearing?

304
00:25:00,181 --> 00:25:03,177
Sit. Come on. I'll show you.

305
00:25:13,028 --> 00:25:15,021
Just put your feet flat on the ground.

306
00:25:17,199 --> 00:25:19,500
Now take the drum
between your legs like this.

307
00:25:23,206 --> 00:25:25,837
Now you want to take
the inside edge off the ground

308
00:25:25,909 --> 00:25:27,502
with your ankles, like this.

309
00:25:29,045 --> 00:25:30,480
Great.

310
00:25:30,548 --> 00:25:32,141
You're okay?

311
00:25:32,215 --> 00:25:33,912
Okay.

312
00:25:33,984 --> 00:25:35,043
Okay.

313
00:25:35,118 --> 00:25:36,781
Now, Walter, I know
you're a very smart man,

314
00:25:36,853 --> 00:25:40,156
but with a drum
you have to remember not to think.

315
00:25:40,224 --> 00:25:42,160
Thinking just screws it up. Okay?

316
00:25:42,226 --> 00:25:43,524
Okay.

317
00:25:43,593 --> 00:25:45,153
Now, give it a couple of bangs.

318
00:25:49,567 --> 00:25:51,092
Not so hard. You're not angry at it.

319
00:25:51,169 --> 00:25:52,763
Okay. I'm sorry.

320
00:25:54,239 --> 00:25:55,229
Okay.

321
00:25:59,244 --> 00:26:01,180
Better. Did you think?

322
00:26:01,246 --> 00:26:02,179
No.

323
00:26:02,247 --> 00:26:03,944
Good.

324
00:26:04,016 --> 00:26:05,679
Now, one more thing, Walter.

325
00:26:05,751 --> 00:26:08,187
You listen to classical music,
so you think in fours.

326
00:26:08,253 --> 00:26:10,190
1, 2, 3, 4.

327
00:26:10,256 --> 00:26:12,522
Dah, dah, dah, dah.

328
00:26:12,592 --> 00:26:13,685
This is an African drum,

329
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:15,160
so we're gonna be playing in threes.

330
00:26:15,228 --> 00:26:16,196
Tak tak tak.

331
00:26:16,262 --> 00:26:17,754
You have to forget your classical.

332
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:19,857
Leave it behind. Tak tak tak.

333
00:26:19,932 --> 00:26:21,195
1, 2, 3.

334
00:26:21,267 --> 00:26:22,257
Come on, follow me.

335
00:26:23,269 --> 00:26:24,533
Tak tak tak.

336
00:26:24,605 --> 00:26:25,664
Tak tak tak.

337
00:26:25,738 --> 00:26:27,104
1, 2, 3.

338
00:26:31,111 --> 00:26:32,204
Don't worry. Start again.

339
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:33,212
Good.

340
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,270
Don't worry.

341
00:26:35,716 --> 00:26:36,707
Again.

342
00:26:42,289 --> 00:26:43,279
Good.

343
00:26:46,127 --> 00:26:47,823
You got it.

344
00:26:47,895 --> 00:26:49,228
Go...

345
00:26:49,297 --> 00:26:50,788
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.

346
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,859
Don't worry. Go again.

347
00:26:59,609 --> 00:27:00,599
Good.

348
00:27:03,646 --> 00:27:04,614
That's it.

349
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,877
Now, keep it going, and I'll do this.

350
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:16,024
There you go.

351
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:17,721
1...

352
00:27:17,794 --> 00:27:18,784
1...

353
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:28,761
Hohh!

354
00:28:05,377 --> 00:28:06,310
Hello.

355
00:28:06,378 --> 00:28:08,143
Hi.

356
00:28:09,382 --> 00:28:10,315
Is Tarek home?

357
00:28:10,383 --> 00:28:14,323
Uh, no. He, uh...
he went to look at another apartment.

358
00:28:15,722 --> 00:28:16,815
Are you okay?

359
00:28:16,889 --> 00:28:18,324
Yes.

360
00:28:18,391 --> 00:28:21,124
Tarek's been giving me drum lessons,
and I was just practicing.

361
00:28:26,066 --> 00:28:28,799
Don't worry. I'll keep my pants on.

362
00:28:30,237 --> 00:28:31,227
What?

363
00:28:32,239 --> 00:28:33,639
Nothing.

364
00:28:33,707 --> 00:28:35,074
It's just that earlier, uh...

365
00:28:36,877 --> 00:28:38,402
No, nothing.

366
00:29:28,966 --> 00:29:30,400
Which is due, in large part,

367
00:29:30,467 --> 00:29:33,405
to the delay in African infrastructure

368
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:36,875
and the slowdown on steel imports.

369
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:52,218
Hey, Walter!

370
00:30:06,005 --> 00:30:07,166
How did the presentation go?

371
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:08,172
Oh, fine. Thanks.

372
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,470
Cool.

373
00:30:10,477 --> 00:30:11,410
- You ready?
- Yeah.

374
00:30:11,478 --> 00:30:12,411
Let's go.

375
00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:14,278
- Can you grab this drum?
- Yeah.

376
00:30:14,347 --> 00:30:15,280
Okay.

377
00:30:15,348 --> 00:30:17,979
You might want to take off
your, uh, name tag.

378
00:30:18,051 --> 00:30:19,041
Oh, okay.

379
00:30:23,023 --> 00:30:23,956
You hungry?

380
00:30:24,024 --> 00:30:25,458
Yeah, I'm starving.

381
00:30:25,526 --> 00:30:26,459
You like shawarmas?

382
00:30:26,527 --> 00:30:28,257
Yeah, I like sharmas.

383
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:31,021
Shawarmas.

384
00:30:35,536 --> 00:30:38,303
Here. This is for you.

385
00:30:38,372 --> 00:30:39,431
For letting us stay.

386
00:30:39,507 --> 00:30:40,806
Oh. Thank you.

387
00:30:43,377 --> 00:30:45,405
It's Fela Kuti. You know him?

388
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,812
Nope.

389
00:30:46,882 --> 00:30:48,283
- You don't know Fela?
- No.

390
00:30:49,384 --> 00:30:51,820
Then, Walter, you're in for a treat.

391
00:30:51,887 --> 00:30:53,481
He started the whole Afrobeat movement.

392
00:30:53,555 --> 00:30:56,425
Oh, and his drummer, Tony Allen,
was just... whoo, scary, man.

393
00:30:56,491 --> 00:30:58,962
You want to play drums,
you have to listen to this.

394
00:30:59,028 --> 00:31:00,291
Okay. I will.

395
00:31:03,231 --> 00:31:04,825
Ooh.

396
00:31:04,901 --> 00:31:06,165
Did you make these?

397
00:31:06,236 --> 00:31:07,499
Yes, I made these.

398
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:08,833
Ooh.

399
00:31:08,905 --> 00:31:10,499
- How much?
- Which one?

400
00:31:10,573 --> 00:31:13,010
Mmm...

401
00:31:13,076 --> 00:31:14,101
this one.

402
00:31:15,111 --> 00:31:16,842
That's $35.

403
00:31:16,914 --> 00:31:18,007
Will you take 30?

404
00:31:18,081 --> 00:31:19,106
No. 35.

405
00:31:19,182 --> 00:31:20,481
Okay.

406
00:31:20,551 --> 00:31:23,044
My daughter will think this is very cool.

407
00:31:24,087 --> 00:31:25,852
Where are you from?

408
00:31:25,923 --> 00:31:26,891
Senegal.

409
00:31:26,958 --> 00:31:29,520
Oh, I was in Cape Town
two summers ago.

410
00:31:29,593 --> 00:31:31,358
It is so beautiful.

411
00:31:32,463 --> 00:31:34,262
- Thank you very much.
- What's your name?

412
00:31:35,432 --> 00:31:36,526
Uh, Zainab.

413
00:31:36,601 --> 00:31:38,035
Zainab!

414
00:31:38,102 --> 00:31:39,092
So pretty.

415
00:31:40,104 --> 00:31:41,596
- Thank you.
- Your change.

416
00:31:47,612 --> 00:31:50,881
How far is Senegal from Cape Town?

417
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,581
About 8,000 kilometers.

418
00:31:54,887 --> 00:31:57,290
I told this guy yesterday
I was from Israel.

419
00:31:57,356 --> 00:31:59,952
He asked if I ever visited the Holy Land.

420
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:04,496
Hey, look who it is!

421
00:32:04,563 --> 00:32:05,496
- Zev.
- What's up, Tarek?

422
00:32:05,564 --> 00:32:06,497
How are you, man?

423
00:32:06,565 --> 00:32:07,498
Good, man.

424
00:32:07,567 --> 00:32:08,500
Hey, honey.

425
00:32:08,568 --> 00:32:10,196
Hi. Hi, Walter.

426
00:32:10,269 --> 00:32:11,202
Hi.

427
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:12,329
Her stuff is great, right?

428
00:32:12,406 --> 00:32:13,567
Beautiful.

429
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,439
She made me this.

430
00:32:15,509 --> 00:32:16,568
It's very nice.

431
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:19,477
So Walter and I
are goin' up to the park

432
00:32:19,546 --> 00:32:21,573
to play for a little bit, okay?

433
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:23,413
Tarek. Remember I told you

434
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:25,214
we have to pick up
my new table today?

435
00:32:25,285 --> 00:32:27,312
He said he'll only hold it for today.

436
00:32:27,387 --> 00:32:28,583
Oh, I know, I know. No problem.

437
00:32:28,656 --> 00:32:32,289
Tarek, you always say "No problem,"
and then you are late or you forget.

438
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,589
I know. I... I will not be long.

439
00:32:33,661 --> 00:32:36,098
We will go up and play,
and we'll come back to help you.

440
00:32:37,665 --> 00:32:39,658
It's a promise, <i>habibti.</i>

441
00:32:42,004 --> 00:32:44,669
It's always <i>habibti</i>
when you want to win, huh?

442
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:45,930
Good-bye.

443
00:32:48,176 --> 00:32:49,109
Bye.

444
00:32:49,177 --> 00:32:51,114
He closes at 5 p.m., Tarek.

445
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,239
No Arab time.

446
00:32:52,314 --> 00:32:53,977
No, not Arab time.

447
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:55,643
Real time, <i>habibti.</i>

448
00:32:57,352 --> 00:32:59,151
Don't <i>habibti</i> me, man.

449
00:32:59,221 --> 00:33:00,348
What does <i>habibti</i> mean?

450
00:33:00,422 --> 00:33:02,655
<i>Habibti?</i> It means "beloved one."

451
00:33:03,927 --> 00:33:05,624
Does she know that?

452
00:33:15,205 --> 00:33:17,642
I always wanted to play down here.

453
00:33:17,708 --> 00:33:19,541
It's supposed to be good money.

454
00:33:20,544 --> 00:33:21,534
Why haven't you?

455
00:33:25,383 --> 00:33:27,148
Maybe we could do it together...

456
00:33:27,219 --> 00:33:28,482
split the profits.

457
00:33:39,564 --> 00:33:40,532
What do you think?

458
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:42,501
I think I'll just watch.

459
00:33:42,567 --> 00:33:43,660
Come on, Walter, it's easy.

460
00:33:43,735 --> 00:33:45,329
You just wait until you feel it.

461
00:33:47,239 --> 00:33:48,172
Yeah, let's go.

462
00:33:48,241 --> 00:33:49,300
Oh...

463
00:35:50,535 --> 00:35:51,594
That was fun, right?

464
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:52,798
Oh, yeah.

465
00:35:52,872 --> 00:35:53,805
How are your hands?

466
00:35:53,873 --> 00:35:54,806
They're...

467
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:59,475
Oh, shit. We have to get home.

468
00:35:59,545 --> 00:36:00,638
Zainab's gonna kill me.

469
00:36:00,713 --> 00:36:02,148
I'm on Arab time again.

470
00:36:02,216 --> 00:36:03,479
What is Arab time?

471
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:05,645
It means I'm late by an hour.

472
00:36:05,718 --> 00:36:06,811
All Arabs are late by an hour.

473
00:36:06,887 --> 00:36:08,823
It's genetic. We can't help it.

474
00:36:18,699 --> 00:36:20,328
I think that's our train.

475
00:36:20,402 --> 00:36:21,335
I'm gonna need a token.

476
00:36:21,402 --> 00:36:22,427
No, I got you. I got you.

477
00:36:22,503 --> 00:36:23,904
Here's our train. Come.

478
00:36:28,843 --> 00:36:30,836
Here, I got you. Let...

479
00:36:37,186 --> 00:36:38,449
I'm stuck, man.

480
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,749
Here, take it.

481
00:36:47,363 --> 00:36:48,353
This way, please.

482
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:49,456
What are you doing?

483
00:36:49,532 --> 00:36:50,465
NYPD.

484
00:36:50,533 --> 00:36:51,626
Step this way, please.

485
00:36:51,701 --> 00:36:53,364
Police? What do you want?

486
00:36:53,436 --> 00:36:54,563
You jumped the turnstile, man.

487
00:36:54,637 --> 00:36:56,402
I did not jump it. I paid.

488
00:36:56,472 --> 00:36:58,169
Sir, he... he paid... Please.

489
00:36:58,241 --> 00:36:59,368
But he paid...

490
00:36:59,442 --> 00:37:00,775
Sir, stand over there!

491
00:37:04,948 --> 00:37:06,918
Got anything else, Tarek?

492
00:37:07,184 --> 00:37:08,414
No. Where you from?

493
00:37:08,485 --> 00:37:10,682
I'm from Syria. Why?

494
00:37:10,754 --> 00:37:12,621
What's in the bag?

495
00:37:12,689 --> 00:37:13,714
It's my drum.

496
00:37:19,797 --> 00:37:22,267
Put this back in your pocket, please, sir.

497
00:37:22,333 --> 00:37:23,461
Step over here.

498
00:37:23,534 --> 00:37:24,900
- Why? I'm sorry...
- Step over here, please.

499
00:37:24,969 --> 00:37:26,529
What did I do?

500
00:37:26,604 --> 00:37:28,403
Oh, come on. Come on.

501
00:37:31,977 --> 00:37:33,879
- I don't think that's necessary.
- Yeah, well, we do.

502
00:37:33,946 --> 00:37:34,936
You can come down to the station

503
00:37:35,214 --> 00:37:36,375
- and make a statement if you want.
- But he didn't...

504
00:37:36,448 --> 00:37:37,917
Sir! That's all I'm saying!

505
00:37:37,983 --> 00:37:40,921
Now, step back,
or we're gonna take you in, too.

506
00:37:40,986 --> 00:37:42,888
Where are you taking him?

507
00:37:42,955 --> 00:37:43,923
10th Precinct.

508
00:37:43,989 --> 00:37:45,925
Walter, take the drum.

509
00:37:45,991 --> 00:37:47,984
Tell Zainab what happened,
but don't let her come.

510
00:37:48,261 --> 00:37:49,661
I will call you.

511
00:37:51,998 --> 00:37:53,432
Don't let her come.

512
00:38:19,026 --> 00:38:19,959
Where's Tarek?

513
00:38:22,029 --> 00:38:23,020
He was arrested.

514
00:38:24,699 --> 00:38:25,826
What?

515
00:38:25,901 --> 00:38:27,460
Yes.

516
00:38:27,535 --> 00:38:28,628
In the subway.

517
00:38:28,703 --> 00:38:30,467
Arrested?

518
00:38:30,538 --> 00:38:32,634
It was just a misunderstanding.

519
00:38:32,708 --> 00:38:34,701
They said he'd be
released later tonight.

520
00:38:38,713 --> 00:38:40,046
How could this happen?

521
00:38:41,284 --> 00:38:43,516
He knows better.
He wouldn't do anything wrong.

522
00:38:43,585 --> 00:38:44,986
No, he didn't.

523
00:38:45,054 --> 00:38:46,488
He didn't.

524
00:38:46,555 --> 00:38:47,956
I'm sure it'll be okay.

525
00:38:49,725 --> 00:38:51,592
No, it won't be okay.

526
00:38:51,661 --> 00:38:54,599
No, I went down to the precinct
and made a statement.

527
00:38:54,664 --> 00:38:55,654
That doesn't matter.

528
00:38:57,067 --> 00:38:59,003
We are illegal.

529
00:38:59,069 --> 00:39:00,834
We are not citizens.

530
00:39:00,904 --> 00:39:02,429
And when they find out, they're going to...

531
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:04,664
Excuse me.

532
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:29,032
Well?

533
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,033
They moved him.

534
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:31,034
To where?

535
00:39:31,103 --> 00:39:32,867
To a detention center in Queens.

536
00:39:32,937 --> 00:39:35,374
He was turned over to Immigration.

537
00:39:35,441 --> 00:39:37,878
They said we can see him
tomorrow night.

538
00:39:37,943 --> 00:39:39,913
Visiting hours are 5 to 10.

539
00:39:39,979 --> 00:39:42,381
I cannot visit that place.

540
00:39:42,449 --> 00:39:43,917
I'll end up there, too.

541
00:40:08,809 --> 00:40:09,869
Zainab?

542
00:40:13,147 --> 00:40:14,080
Yes.

543
00:40:14,148 --> 00:40:16,745
I brought some Chinese food home,
if you'd like to eat.

544
00:40:16,818 --> 00:40:18,685
Oh, no, thank you. I'm not hungry.

545
00:40:18,753 --> 00:40:22,989
Okay. Well, if you change your mind,
I'll leave some in the fridge.

546
00:40:23,057 --> 00:40:24,048
Thank you.

547
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:26,890
Have you heard from Tarek?

548
00:40:27,896 --> 00:40:29,889
No. Not yet.

549
00:40:29,965 --> 00:40:32,630
Oh. Well...

550
00:40:32,701 --> 00:40:34,603
I made an appointment
with an immigration attorney

551
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:36,104
for tomorrow morning at 11.

552
00:40:36,171 --> 00:40:37,470
No. We can't afford that.

553
00:40:37,539 --> 00:40:38,734
That's okay.

554
00:40:42,845 --> 00:40:44,144
Thank you, Walter.

555
00:40:47,183 --> 00:40:48,173
Walter.

556
00:40:51,187 --> 00:40:53,454
I was in detention...

557
00:40:53,524 --> 00:40:57,157
when I first arrived, for five months.

558
00:40:58,828 --> 00:40:59,956
How did you get out?

559
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:05,770
They... closed the facility
and released some of the women.

560
00:41:05,836 --> 00:41:07,829
They didn't release any of the men.

561
00:41:09,874 --> 00:41:11,103
We'll get him out.

562
00:41:14,212 --> 00:41:15,145
Good night.

563
00:41:15,213 --> 00:41:16,476
Good night.

564
00:42:18,947 --> 00:42:19,937
Okay.

565
00:42:21,283 --> 00:42:22,273
Yeah.

566
00:42:24,786 --> 00:42:25,776
Okay.

567
00:42:27,289 --> 00:42:28,757
Sir, that detainee has been moved.

568
00:42:28,823 --> 00:42:30,725
He was here yesterday.

569
00:42:30,793 --> 00:42:32,227
Well, he's not here now.
That's all I know.

570
00:42:32,294 --> 00:42:34,925
You can call I.C.
The number's on the wall.

571
00:42:34,997 --> 00:42:35,930
Where?

572
00:42:35,998 --> 00:42:38,731
On the wall by the phone
and the water fountain.

573
00:42:38,801 --> 00:42:39,791
Next.

574
00:42:41,137 --> 00:42:42,799
Sir, step aside, please.

575
00:42:48,144 --> 00:42:51,082
Hi. I'm here to see Tarek Khalil.

576
00:42:51,147 --> 00:42:52,582
Have you been here before?

577
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:53,640
No, sir.

578
00:42:55,151 --> 00:42:56,244
Hello?

579
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,913
May I see your driver's license, please?

580
00:42:58,922 --> 00:43:00,255
Yes, it is. Um...

581
00:43:00,324 --> 00:43:02,089
the one you...

582
00:43:58,385 --> 00:44:00,321
Hi, <i>papito.</i>

583
00:44:01,388 --> 00:44:02,378
Hi.

584
00:44:05,727 --> 00:44:07,321
Walter. Thank you for coming.

585
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:09,365
Of course.

586
00:44:09,631 --> 00:44:11,692
How is Zainab?

587
00:44:11,766 --> 00:44:14,169
She's upset. Um...

588
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:17,002
I have a... a letter from her.

589
00:44:17,072 --> 00:44:18,335
Oh, you can't give it to me.

590
00:44:18,406 --> 00:44:21,003
It has to be sent to me by mail.

591
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:23,339
Oh.

592
00:44:23,412 --> 00:44:25,405
But... But you can put it up to the glass.

593
00:44:26,415 --> 00:44:27,348
Go ahead. Open it up

594
00:44:27,416 --> 00:44:29,682
and press it up to the glass
so I can read it.

595
00:44:31,053 --> 00:44:32,886
It's okay. It's allowed.

596
00:44:44,735 --> 00:44:46,899
You want to say hello to <i>papá?</i>

597
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,376
Oh...

598
00:44:58,449 --> 00:45:00,008
Thank you, Walter.

599
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,349
So how are they treating you?

600
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:08,283
It's very depressing here.

601
00:45:10,461 --> 00:45:11,394
There's no privacy.

602
00:45:11,462 --> 00:45:12,726
The lights are always on.

603
00:45:14,298 --> 00:45:15,324
You need anything?

604
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,802
No. I just want to get out of here.

605
00:45:19,137 --> 00:45:22,007
Well... Zainab and I met
with a lawyer today.

606
00:45:22,074 --> 00:45:24,010
Yes? What did he say?

607
00:45:24,076 --> 00:45:26,741
Well, he's... he's gonna
stop by tomorrow and see you.

608
00:45:29,148 --> 00:45:33,783
Tarek. Zainab said
that you were denied asylum.

609
00:45:33,853 --> 00:45:35,413
You mean when we came here?

610
00:45:35,488 --> 00:45:36,956
Yeah.

611
00:45:37,023 --> 00:45:39,493
Did you go to your deportation hearing?

612
00:45:39,759 --> 00:45:41,251
Yeah.

613
00:45:41,327 --> 00:45:42,420
In Michigan.

614
00:45:42,495 --> 00:45:44,192
Yeah. We did everything they told us to.

615
00:45:44,264 --> 00:45:45,493
Okay.

616
00:45:47,468 --> 00:45:48,902
Let's go, man. You gotta get off.

617
00:45:48,968 --> 00:45:50,437
Bed count.

618
00:45:50,504 --> 00:45:52,097
I have to go.

619
00:45:52,172 --> 00:45:54,938
They have to do a bed count.

620
00:45:55,009 --> 00:45:56,807
Usually, I can visit for one hour.

621
00:45:56,878 --> 00:45:57,937
Could you come tomorrow?

622
00:45:58,012 --> 00:46:00,380
- I will. Yeah.
- Good.

623
00:46:00,448 --> 00:46:01,781
Good-bye, my friend.

624
00:46:01,850 --> 00:46:02,840
Good-bye.

625
00:46:14,529 --> 00:46:15,462
I'll see you tomorrow.

626
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:17,193
Okay. Bye.

627
00:46:23,038 --> 00:46:24,803
Walter, I'm going to leave now.

628
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:28,471
I have a cousin who lives in the Bronx.

629
00:46:28,544 --> 00:46:31,038
I'm going to go
stay with him for now.

630
00:46:32,248 --> 00:46:33,979
You don't have to go.
You can stay here.

631
00:46:35,384 --> 00:46:37,047
I think it's better I leave.

632
00:46:38,054 --> 00:46:41,516
Um... you know how to reach me
if you need to.

633
00:46:45,395 --> 00:46:48,299
Is it okay if I leave
Tarek's things here for now?

634
00:46:49,299 --> 00:46:54,173
Uh, my cousin's place is...
not very big.

635
00:46:55,238 --> 00:46:56,468
Yes, of course.

636
00:46:57,575 --> 00:46:58,804
Thank you.

637
00:47:20,899 --> 00:47:21,889
Hello?

638
00:47:23,202 --> 00:47:24,602
Oh. Hi, Charles.

639
00:47:26,105 --> 00:47:28,098
Oh. Wait. I'm sorry. Wha... What?

640
00:47:29,943 --> 00:47:31,845
Yeah. The conference went very well.

641
00:47:31,911 --> 00:47:33,380
Yes.

642
00:47:33,446 --> 00:47:37,044
No, uh, actually, I'm still in New York,
and I'm doing some research for my book.

643
00:47:37,117 --> 00:47:38,380
Why?

644
00:47:39,452 --> 00:47:41,081
When's the meeting?

645
00:47:41,154 --> 00:47:42,554
Wha...

646
00:47:42,622 --> 00:47:43,555
Oh. Okay.

647
00:47:43,623 --> 00:47:45,890
All right. I... I'll, um...

648
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:48,396
I'll leave first thing tomorrow.

649
00:47:48,462 --> 00:47:51,228
Yeah. I'll see you at 3. Bye.

650
00:48:01,309 --> 00:48:03,302
I thought you said
you went to the hearing.

651
00:48:03,377 --> 00:48:05,074
We did. I remember it.

652
00:48:05,147 --> 00:48:07,584
Well, then why is there
a final order out on you?

653
00:48:07,649 --> 00:48:09,243
He didn't know yet. He just said

654
00:48:09,318 --> 00:48:12,290
that unless they can find a way
to reopen the case quickly,

655
00:48:12,354 --> 00:48:13,583
they're going to deport me.

656
00:48:15,157 --> 00:48:17,423
I don't even understand it.

657
00:48:17,492 --> 00:48:20,430
Walter, there are guys
who have been in here for years.

658
00:48:20,495 --> 00:48:22,260
I can't do that, Walter. I'll go crazy.

659
00:48:22,331 --> 00:48:25,600
He's trying to deal with the case
as quickly as possible.

660
00:48:25,668 --> 00:48:27,604
I know. I know. It's...

661
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:29,139
It's just...

662
00:48:30,206 --> 00:48:32,472
Look, maybe we
should call your mother.

663
00:48:32,542 --> 00:48:35,982
No. No. I don't want her to worry.

664
00:48:37,513 --> 00:48:38,503
Yeah.

665
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:44,489
Tarek, um...

666
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:47,622
I have to go back to Connecticut.

667
00:48:47,691 --> 00:48:49,126
When?

668
00:48:49,193 --> 00:48:50,456
Tomorrow.

669
00:48:50,527 --> 00:48:52,998
But I'll be reachable
by phone if you need anything.

670
00:48:53,064 --> 00:48:56,298
And I'll be back to visit. It's not far.

671
00:48:56,366 --> 00:48:57,630
Okay.

672
00:48:57,702 --> 00:48:59,136
Just please...

673
00:48:59,203 --> 00:49:00,638
don't forget about me in here.

674
00:49:00,705 --> 00:49:02,368
No, I won't.

675
00:49:06,045 --> 00:49:07,638
So have you been practicing?

676
00:49:07,712 --> 00:49:09,648
Yes.

677
00:49:09,714 --> 00:49:11,547
You should go back to the drum circle.

678
00:49:11,616 --> 00:49:12,642
No.

679
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:17,715
Okay, but listen to that Fela CD.
That will help you.

680
00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:19,721
- I promise.
- I will. I will.

681
00:49:22,229 --> 00:49:24,529
So show me what you...
you've been working on.

682
00:49:24,597 --> 00:49:26,328
What?

683
00:49:26,399 --> 00:49:28,232
Show me. Why not?

684
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:29,268
Here?

685
00:49:29,335 --> 00:49:31,396
Come on. I need some music, man.

686
00:49:32,739 --> 00:49:34,675
Don't worry. They can't arrest you.

687
00:49:34,741 --> 00:49:36,209
At least, not yet.

688
00:49:37,744 --> 00:49:38,734
Mmm...

689
00:49:39,012 --> 00:49:40,140
Come on.

690
00:50:01,602 --> 00:50:02,695
Good.

691
00:50:07,776 --> 00:50:09,769
Oh, no. An elbow.

692
00:50:33,137 --> 00:50:34,196
Hello.

693
00:50:34,271 --> 00:50:35,239
Oh, I'm sorry. I must've got

694
00:50:35,306 --> 00:50:37,743
- the wrong apartment.
- Can I help you?

695
00:50:37,808 --> 00:50:39,333
I'm looking for my son.

696
00:50:39,409 --> 00:50:40,571
Excuse me.

697
00:50:40,644 --> 00:50:42,807
Uh, are...
are you Tarek's mother?

698
00:50:44,548 --> 00:50:45,538
Yes.

699
00:50:45,616 --> 00:50:49,078
Well, this is Tarek's apartment.

700
00:50:49,154 --> 00:50:50,247
I j...

701
00:50:50,321 --> 00:50:51,812
I share the apartment with him.

702
00:50:53,491 --> 00:50:55,586
He didn't mention
that he lived with someone.

703
00:50:56,828 --> 00:50:58,353
Well, I'm not here very often.

704
00:50:58,429 --> 00:50:59,830
I... I live in Connecticut.

705
00:51:00,832 --> 00:51:02,597
Is Tarek here?

706
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:05,765
No. He's not here now.

707
00:51:05,837 --> 00:51:07,830
Uh, come in... please.

708
00:51:10,675 --> 00:51:11,837
Please.

709
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:15,239
Thank you.

710
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:25,456
Oh, my name is Walter. Walter Vale.

711
00:51:25,525 --> 00:51:27,290
I'm... I'm Mouna Khalil.

712
00:51:27,361 --> 00:51:29,388
I'm sorry to show up unannounced.

713
00:51:30,563 --> 00:51:32,260
My son hasn't called me for five days.

714
00:51:32,332 --> 00:51:34,860
I keep trying his cell phone,
but he doesn't answer.

715
00:51:36,536 --> 00:51:37,799
Would you like to sit down?

716
00:51:37,871 --> 00:51:38,861
Thank you.

717
00:51:57,226 --> 00:51:58,819
Mr. Vale?

718
00:51:58,893 --> 00:52:00,362
Is my son all right?

719
00:52:00,428 --> 00:52:01,418
Yes.

720
00:52:02,898 --> 00:52:04,230
He's been arrested.

721
00:52:06,401 --> 00:52:08,634
He's being held in a detention center.

722
00:52:09,738 --> 00:52:10,671
Where?

723
00:52:10,739 --> 00:52:11,832
In Queens.

724
00:52:11,907 --> 00:52:14,242
Uh, they're tying to deport him.

725
00:52:18,747 --> 00:52:19,841
How did this happen?

726
00:52:19,916 --> 00:52:22,854
He was stopped in a subway station.

727
00:52:22,919 --> 00:52:25,891
Uh... he didn't... didn't
do anything wrong.

728
00:52:28,925 --> 00:52:30,918
I'd like to go there, to Queens.

729
00:52:32,596 --> 00:52:33,586
Okay.

730
00:52:34,931 --> 00:52:37,368
But, Mrs. Khalil, um, the lawyer m...

731
00:52:38,936 --> 00:52:41,304
Uh, I just don't
think it's possible for you...

732
00:52:41,372 --> 00:52:44,709
Mr. Vale, I know I cannot visit Tarek.

733
00:52:44,776 --> 00:52:47,771
I just want to see the place
where they're holding him.

734
00:52:49,614 --> 00:52:50,604
Okay.

735
00:52:51,782 --> 00:52:52,875
I can take you there.

736
00:52:52,951 --> 00:52:54,419
Thank you.

737
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:57,953
Could we go now?

738
00:53:17,810 --> 00:53:20,280
So have you been
to New York before, Mrs. Khalil?

739
00:53:20,346 --> 00:53:24,480
No. Tarek wanted to come to New York
to play music.

740
00:53:24,550 --> 00:53:26,679
I did not want him to, but...

741
00:53:27,687 --> 00:53:29,281
Do you have
any children, Mr. Vale?

742
00:53:29,356 --> 00:53:31,519
A son. He lives in London.

743
00:53:31,591 --> 00:53:33,619
And your wife?

744
00:53:33,694 --> 00:53:35,596
My wife passed away.

745
00:53:35,662 --> 00:53:36,652
I'm sorry.

746
00:53:43,638 --> 00:53:44,628
That's it.

747
00:53:46,341 --> 00:53:48,675
- This is where the prison is?
- Mm-hmm.

748
00:53:48,743 --> 00:53:50,770
It doesn't look like a prison.

749
00:53:50,845 --> 00:53:52,336
I think that's the point.

750
00:53:54,682 --> 00:53:56,447
How many people are in there?

751
00:53:56,518 --> 00:53:58,385
Tarek said about 300.

752
00:54:00,021 --> 00:54:01,456
There's, uh...

753
00:54:01,523 --> 00:54:03,015
There's a coffee shop on that corner.

754
00:54:03,292 --> 00:54:05,023
- It's not very nice.
- I'll wait there.

755
00:54:41,899 --> 00:54:43,994
Walter. I thought you were leaving.

756
00:54:44,068 --> 00:54:45,058
I was.

757
00:54:47,406 --> 00:54:48,806
Tarek, your mother is here.

758
00:54:48,873 --> 00:54:51,002
What? My mother? Where?

759
00:54:51,075 --> 00:54:52,908
She's waiting outside.

760
00:54:54,746 --> 00:54:55,679
When did she arrive?

761
00:54:55,746 --> 00:54:56,679
Today.

762
00:54:56,748 --> 00:54:58,844
Man. Why did she come?

763
00:54:58,917 --> 00:55:00,317
She can do nothing for me.

764
00:55:00,386 --> 00:55:02,857
Well, she said
she hadn't heard from you.

765
00:55:04,756 --> 00:55:07,022
Walter, listen to me.

766
00:55:07,092 --> 00:55:08,527
She... She can't stay here.

767
00:55:08,594 --> 00:55:10,587
She doesn't know
anyone in New York.

768
00:55:10,662 --> 00:55:13,327
I'm sorry, but you must get her
to go back to Michigan.

769
00:55:15,101 --> 00:55:17,698
Okay. Okay, I'll try.

770
00:55:17,770 --> 00:55:19,033
Thank you, Walter.

771
00:55:20,773 --> 00:55:22,105
I have a note from her.

772
00:55:39,628 --> 00:55:40,789
Need anything else?

773
00:55:42,129 --> 00:55:43,462
No, thank you.

774
00:56:28,178 --> 00:56:29,111
Hello, sir.

775
00:56:29,179 --> 00:56:30,169
Hi.

776
00:56:32,783 --> 00:56:33,773
How is he?

777
00:56:33,851 --> 00:56:35,445
Oh, he's good. He's good.

778
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,615
Um... but...

779
00:56:37,689 --> 00:56:40,183
he's very concerned
about you being here.

780
00:56:42,193 --> 00:56:43,787
I will not leave.

781
00:56:46,197 --> 00:56:48,498
Mrs. Khalil, I don't... I don't think

782
00:56:48,566 --> 00:56:50,125
your being in New York will do any good

783
00:56:50,201 --> 00:56:52,103
because we have a very good lawyer
working on Tarek's...

784
00:56:52,171 --> 00:56:53,469
Mr. Vale.

785
00:56:53,539 --> 00:56:55,509
I will not go back to Michigan

786
00:56:55,574 --> 00:56:58,478
knowing that my son is in that building.

787
00:57:00,212 --> 00:57:02,205
Even if I can't see him...

788
00:57:03,215 --> 00:57:04,707
I will stay here.

789
00:57:10,557 --> 00:57:11,616
Shall we go?

790
00:57:15,929 --> 00:57:17,454
Uh madame?

791
00:57:23,570 --> 00:57:24,560
Bye.

792
00:57:33,081 --> 00:57:34,174
Mr. Vale?

793
00:57:35,916 --> 00:57:37,111
I'm leaving now.

794
00:57:37,184 --> 00:57:39,177
Thank you for your help.

795
00:57:39,253 --> 00:57:40,552
Where are you going?

796
00:57:41,590 --> 00:57:42,888
I'll find a hotel.

797
00:57:42,957 --> 00:57:45,690
You can stay here.
You can use Tarek's room.

798
00:57:47,095 --> 00:57:49,931
Thank you for your offer,
but I cannot accept it.

799
00:57:49,998 --> 00:57:51,523
I don't want to impose on you.

800
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,194
You're not imposing.

801
00:57:53,268 --> 00:57:55,762
Please. I would like you to stay.

802
00:57:56,773 --> 00:57:57,763
Thank you.

803
00:57:58,774 --> 00:57:59,935
But I will manage.

804
00:58:04,614 --> 00:58:06,049
Good-bye.

805
00:58:06,115 --> 00:58:07,242
Good-bye.

806
00:58:24,301 --> 00:58:26,294
Um... Mrs... Mrs. Khalil?

807
00:58:28,305 --> 00:58:29,295
Please.

808
00:58:30,642 --> 00:58:32,578
I was with Tarek
when he was arrested.

809
00:58:32,644 --> 00:58:35,582
He was in the subway
in the first place because of me.

810
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:36,637
So...

811
00:58:37,649 --> 00:58:38,878
please.

812
00:58:39,884 --> 00:58:41,319
Even if it's just for one night.

813
00:58:54,834 --> 00:58:57,328
Um, the bathroom is across the hall.

814
00:58:58,337 --> 00:58:59,270
Thank you, Mr. Vale.

815
00:58:59,338 --> 00:59:02,276
No. Call me Walter.

816
00:59:02,341 --> 00:59:03,331
And I'm Mouna.

817
00:59:04,845 --> 00:59:06,576
So... do you need anything else?

818
00:59:06,646 --> 00:59:07,739
No, thank you.

819
00:59:09,182 --> 00:59:11,278
Well... good night.

820
00:59:11,351 --> 00:59:12,341
Good night.

821
00:59:51,059 --> 00:59:52,220
Okay?

822
00:59:57,332 --> 00:59:58,391
Bye.

823
01:00:10,413 --> 01:00:12,280
Oh. Good morning.

824
01:00:12,349 --> 01:00:13,282
Morning.

825
01:00:13,349 --> 01:00:14,408
Mmhh...

826
01:00:19,423 --> 01:00:20,857
Tarek says hello.

827
01:00:21,926 --> 01:00:23,361
How is he?

828
01:00:23,427 --> 01:00:24,919
I can't really tell.

829
01:00:28,432 --> 01:00:30,368
He wants me to leave.

830
01:00:33,772 --> 01:00:37,212
Well... you're welcome to stay here
as long as you need to.

831
01:00:37,275 --> 01:00:38,208
Thank you.

832
01:00:38,276 --> 01:00:39,972
That's very generous of you.

833
01:00:40,046 --> 01:00:42,882
Well... thank you for the paper.

834
01:00:42,948 --> 01:00:43,973
You're welcome.

835
01:01:02,468 --> 01:01:05,406
Do you spend a lot of time in the city?

836
01:01:05,471 --> 01:01:08,238
No, no. Not really.

837
01:01:08,307 --> 01:01:11,405
I'm just here
presenting a paper at a conference.

838
01:01:11,478 --> 01:01:13,243
Well...

839
01:01:13,313 --> 01:01:14,246
You wrote it?

840
01:01:14,314 --> 01:01:15,304
Mm-hmm.

841
01:01:16,483 --> 01:01:17,815
Congratulations.

842
01:01:22,322 --> 01:01:24,258
I co-authored it, really.

843
01:01:31,132 --> 01:01:32,498
And what happened after the hearing?

844
01:01:33,735 --> 01:01:35,831
We appealed. It took two years.

845
01:01:35,904 --> 01:01:37,202
And your appeal was denied?

846
01:01:37,272 --> 01:01:38,764
Yes.

847
01:01:38,841 --> 01:01:41,107
And did they send you
your bag-and-baggage letter?

848
01:01:41,176 --> 01:01:42,907
- No.
- What's that?

849
01:01:42,977 --> 01:01:45,949
Basically, it tells you
where to show up and be deported.

850
01:01:46,014 --> 01:01:47,004
But you didn't receive it?

851
01:01:48,184 --> 01:01:50,279
No. I would remember this.

852
01:01:50,352 --> 01:01:51,786
Did you move?

853
01:01:51,854 --> 01:01:53,380
Eventually, we had to.

854
01:01:53,455 --> 01:01:55,448
But we had our mail advanced.

855
01:01:55,524 --> 01:01:58,462
Is it possible that it
just never got there?

856
01:01:58,528 --> 01:01:59,962
Yeah, it's happened before.

857
01:02:00,029 --> 01:02:02,466
And pre-9/11, it wasn't much of a priority
trackin' people down,

858
01:02:02,532 --> 01:02:06,027
but if you got it and you just ignored it,
then there's nothing I can do.

859
01:02:09,206 --> 01:02:11,142
So... you can help him.

860
01:02:11,207 --> 01:02:12,972
I'm gonna try.

861
01:02:13,044 --> 01:02:14,775
But you should know it's still a long shot.

862
01:02:14,845 --> 01:02:16,245
The government's approach
has changed radically.

863
01:02:16,313 --> 01:02:17,475
It's very black and white now.

864
01:02:17,548 --> 01:02:19,073
Either you belong, or you don't.

865
01:02:19,150 --> 01:02:21,986
Tarek's lucky.
Most of them don't even have lawyers.

866
01:02:22,052 --> 01:02:23,282
Lucky.

867
01:02:23,354 --> 01:02:24,913
Relatively speaking.

868
01:02:24,990 --> 01:02:26,424
We just have to move quickly

869
01:02:26,491 --> 01:02:28,484
to get an emergency stay,
and then we'll stick with a motion

870
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:30,290
to reopen, pending his green card application.

871
01:02:30,361 --> 01:02:31,351
Yeah?

872
01:02:33,197 --> 01:02:34,130
Okay.

873
01:02:35,199 --> 01:02:36,964
Can you explain
what that means, please?

874
01:02:37,034 --> 01:02:38,833
Actually, I don't have
the time right now.

875
01:02:38,904 --> 01:02:41,205
I'm sorry.
I have to be in court very shortly.

876
01:02:41,273 --> 01:02:42,502
How long will he be in detention?

877
01:02:42,574 --> 01:02:46,344
I can't predict that. I am sorry,
but I am gonna have to wrap this up.

878
01:02:46,411 --> 01:02:49,578
Do you have any children, Mr. Shah?

879
01:02:51,250 --> 01:02:53,517
Yeah. Two kids.

880
01:02:53,586 --> 01:02:55,214
And for what it's worth,
my uncle was deported

881
01:02:55,288 --> 01:02:57,520
after raising a family here for 23 years.

882
01:02:58,525 --> 01:03:01,520
If I can get your son out... I will.

883
01:03:02,830 --> 01:03:03,820
Thank you.

884
01:03:08,569 --> 01:03:09,559
Where are you from?

885
01:03:10,604 --> 01:03:11,594
Queens.

886
01:03:14,275 --> 01:03:15,538
Which one is she?

887
01:03:15,609 --> 01:03:16,542
The one closest to us.

888
01:03:16,610 --> 01:03:18,512
That black woman?

889
01:03:18,579 --> 01:03:19,512
Mm-hmm.

890
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:20,513
That is Zainab?

891
01:03:20,581 --> 01:03:21,571
Mm-hmm.

892
01:03:23,952 --> 01:03:25,284
She's very black.

893
01:03:26,287 --> 01:03:27,277
Mm-hmm.

894
01:03:35,463 --> 01:03:36,590
Zainab.

895
01:03:37,967 --> 01:03:39,458
Oh. Hi, Walter.

896
01:03:39,534 --> 01:03:41,903
Uh, Zainab, this is Mouna Khalil...

897
01:03:41,971 --> 01:03:43,565
Tarek's mother.

898
01:03:43,639 --> 01:03:44,902
- Oh...
- Hello, Zainab.

899
01:03:44,974 --> 01:03:46,237
Oh, I...

900
01:03:46,309 --> 01:03:48,438
It's a pleasure
to meet you, Mrs. Khalil.

901
01:03:48,511 --> 01:03:49,501
You, too.

902
01:03:50,546 --> 01:03:52,983
Uh... I'm s... I'm sorry.

903
01:03:53,049 --> 01:03:54,574
I... I didn't know
you were coming.

904
01:03:54,650 --> 01:03:56,643
Neither did I.

905
01:04:00,657 --> 01:04:02,923
Your jewelry is very nice.

906
01:04:02,993 --> 01:04:04,257
Oh.

907
01:04:04,327 --> 01:04:05,556
Oh, thank you.

908
01:04:08,665 --> 01:04:11,228
Do you think we can go out
for a cup of tea sometime?

909
01:04:11,301 --> 01:04:13,271
Oh... yeah.

910
01:04:13,336 --> 01:04:14,599
We could go right now.

911
01:04:14,672 --> 01:04:17,610
I... I am...
I'm just watching Zev's table,

912
01:04:17,675 --> 01:04:19,907
but I... um...

913
01:04:19,977 --> 01:04:23,678
I just need to... find someone to...

914
01:04:30,521 --> 01:04:31,614
Hey.

915
01:04:31,690 --> 01:04:32,680
Hi.

916
01:04:36,695 --> 01:04:38,220
Is it a necklace?

917
01:04:38,297 --> 01:04:39,424
I think so.

918
01:04:41,201 --> 01:04:42,692
I like that one in the front.

919
01:04:44,370 --> 01:04:45,360
Um...

920
01:04:46,505 --> 01:04:47,700
It's all handmade.

921
01:04:49,375 --> 01:04:50,400
Ooh.

922
01:04:51,510 --> 01:04:54,483
I've lived here for two years,

923
01:04:54,547 --> 01:04:57,177
and I was in France
for a year before that.

924
01:04:58,384 --> 01:04:59,477
Do you miss home?

925
01:04:59,552 --> 01:05:01,989
Yes, sometimes.

926
01:05:03,256 --> 01:05:04,724
But I don't want to live there.

927
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:07,721
Do you miss Syria?

928
01:05:10,064 --> 01:05:11,431
Sometimes, too.

929
01:05:13,067 --> 01:05:15,003
I miss Damascus...

930
01:05:15,069 --> 01:05:16,094
the smell.

931
01:05:18,406 --> 01:05:20,239
But this is my home now.

932
01:05:22,410 --> 01:05:23,743
When did you meet Walter?

933
01:05:24,012 --> 01:05:26,175
Walter? Uh...

934
01:05:26,248 --> 01:05:28,651
about ten days ago.

935
01:05:28,717 --> 01:05:31,051
Ten days? That's all?

936
01:05:31,118 --> 01:05:32,519
Mm-hmm.

937
01:05:33,755 --> 01:05:35,520
How did you meet him?

938
01:05:35,590 --> 01:05:36,580
Uh...

939
01:05:37,759 --> 01:05:39,490
through Tarek's friend.

940
01:05:39,561 --> 01:05:42,032
Ivan. That's how we
ended up living there.

941
01:05:42,098 --> 01:05:44,159
You live there, too?

942
01:05:45,301 --> 01:05:46,770
Just for a little while.

943
01:05:47,770 --> 01:05:48,760
Oh.

944
01:05:56,279 --> 01:05:58,716
So... have you spoken to Tarek?

945
01:05:58,782 --> 01:06:00,546
Yes.

946
01:06:00,617 --> 01:06:02,210
He called me this morning.

947
01:06:02,285 --> 01:06:04,016
He sounded in a good spirit.

948
01:06:06,290 --> 01:06:08,385
I was so afraid this was going to happen.

949
01:06:10,128 --> 01:06:12,360
Tarek used to tease me
that I worry too much.

950
01:06:12,429 --> 01:06:13,419
But now...

951
01:06:15,733 --> 01:06:17,669
I just don't know what to do.

952
01:06:19,471 --> 01:06:21,133
I miss him so much.

953
01:06:23,475 --> 01:06:24,500
I'm sorry.

954
01:06:29,814 --> 01:06:30,805
Zainab.

955
01:06:32,317 --> 01:06:34,184
I'd like you to do something for me.

956
01:06:34,253 --> 01:06:38,091
I'd like you to show me
something you and Tarek like to do,

957
01:06:38,157 --> 01:06:39,592
somewhere you like to go.

958
01:06:40,826 --> 01:06:42,557
Like what?

959
01:06:43,596 --> 01:06:45,259
Whatever you like.

960
01:06:45,331 --> 01:06:47,426
Okay.

961
01:06:47,499 --> 01:06:48,832
Okay.

962
01:07:04,852 --> 01:07:06,582
So what is in Staten Island?

963
01:07:07,587 --> 01:07:08,783
I don't know.

964
01:07:08,856 --> 01:07:11,258
We would just go there
and then come back.

965
01:07:11,325 --> 01:07:12,350
We never got off.

966
01:07:12,427 --> 01:07:13,417
Why?

967
01:07:14,862 --> 01:07:15,795
It was free.

968
01:07:15,863 --> 01:07:18,096
We felt like we were going somewhere.

969
01:07:19,533 --> 01:07:23,132
Oh. That's where the Twin Towers were.

970
01:07:23,205 --> 01:07:26,109
I never saw them, but... Tarek did.

971
01:07:27,142 --> 01:07:28,303
Oh. And...

972
01:07:28,377 --> 01:07:29,846
there's the Statue.

973
01:07:30,112 --> 01:07:32,139
And behind that is Ellis Island.

974
01:07:33,249 --> 01:07:36,813
Sometimes Tarek would point at the Statue
and jump up and down

975
01:07:36,885 --> 01:07:39,618
like we're arriving
in New York for the first time.

976
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:43,292
It was very funny.

977
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:47,831
Can you go up in the Statue?

978
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:49,491
Oh, yeah.

979
01:07:49,566 --> 01:07:50,556
I think so.

980
01:07:51,734 --> 01:07:52,793
You haven't been there?

981
01:07:52,869 --> 01:07:53,802
No.

982
01:07:53,870 --> 01:07:54,803
Never?

983
01:07:54,871 --> 01:07:55,839
Nope.

984
01:07:55,906 --> 01:07:57,534
Oh.

985
01:07:58,541 --> 01:07:59,840
Excuse me.

986
01:07:59,910 --> 01:08:00,900
Hello?

987
01:08:01,912 --> 01:08:02,902
Hey, Charles.

988
01:08:04,248 --> 01:08:05,307
What's that?

989
01:08:05,383 --> 01:08:08,583
Um, yeah. I'm still in New York.

990
01:08:10,255 --> 01:08:12,555
I'm sorry, Charles.
I couldn't make it back yesterday.

991
01:08:13,624 --> 01:08:16,255
I said I couldn't make it back!

992
01:08:16,327 --> 01:08:17,728
Well, I'm on a boat.

993
01:08:18,730 --> 01:08:19,823
A boat!

994
01:08:19,898 --> 01:08:22,392
Listen, Charles, I'll explain it to you
when I see you.

995
01:08:22,468 --> 01:08:24,198
But I have to go now,
so I'll call you back.

996
01:08:24,269 --> 01:08:25,260
Bye.

997
01:08:36,949 --> 01:08:38,315
You went on the ferry?

998
01:08:38,383 --> 01:08:39,351
Yes.

999
01:08:39,418 --> 01:08:40,511
No.

1000
01:08:40,587 --> 01:08:42,180
- My mother, too?
- She liked it.

1001
01:08:44,491 --> 01:08:47,895
You know that they don't even have
an outside space here.

1002
01:08:47,961 --> 01:08:50,261
They just have a room
with its roof cut out.

1003
01:08:50,330 --> 01:08:51,559
Really?

1004
01:08:51,630 --> 01:08:53,965
Some crazy stuff, man.

1005
01:08:55,802 --> 01:08:57,236
And they seemed to get along...

1006
01:08:57,304 --> 01:08:58,237
Zainab and my mother?

1007
01:08:58,305 --> 01:09:01,301
Yes. I think your mother
likes her very much.

1008
01:09:04,312 --> 01:09:05,906
My mother's not going home, is she?

1009
01:09:05,980 --> 01:09:07,973
I don't think so.

1010
01:09:09,750 --> 01:09:11,617
I know she's thinking about my father.

1011
01:09:12,820 --> 01:09:13,810
Why?

1012
01:09:16,325 --> 01:09:17,918
He spent seven years in jail in Syria

1013
01:09:17,992 --> 01:09:19,985
because of something
he wrote in the newspaper.

1014
01:09:21,330 --> 01:09:24,792
By the time
they released him, he was very sick.

1015
01:09:26,502 --> 01:09:28,769
He died two months later.

1016
01:09:28,837 --> 01:09:30,328
That's why we moved here.

1017
01:09:34,510 --> 01:09:35,944
Would you like a glass of wine?

1018
01:09:36,011 --> 01:09:37,674
No, thank you.

1019
01:09:48,858 --> 01:09:51,260
Mouna. Um...

1020
01:09:51,329 --> 01:09:55,963
I need to go back to Connecticut
tomorrow, for work. I told Tarek.

1021
01:09:56,033 --> 01:09:57,626
How long will you be gone?

1022
01:09:57,701 --> 01:09:59,762
Um, I don't know yet. I...

1023
01:10:01,038 --> 01:10:03,703
I'll try to get back
and visit him as soon as I can.

1024
01:10:05,709 --> 01:10:08,806
Walter, you don't have
to keep visiting him.

1025
01:10:08,879 --> 01:10:10,040
I'm sure you're busy.

1026
01:10:13,718 --> 01:10:15,051
I'll see what I can do.

1027
01:10:21,726 --> 01:10:22,989
Dinner will be ready soon.

1028
01:10:23,061 --> 01:10:24,758
Oh. Okay.

1029
01:10:38,077 --> 01:10:40,571
Walter. Do you go to Broadway?

1030
01:10:41,682 --> 01:10:42,672
No, not really.

1031
01:10:44,418 --> 01:10:45,613
Tarek sent me the CD

1032
01:10:49,390 --> 01:10:51,087
I think I know every word.

1033
01:10:58,098 --> 01:10:59,829
Tarek is teaching me the drum.

1034
01:11:00,834 --> 01:11:02,701
Really? How is that going?

1035
01:11:03,704 --> 01:11:05,037
Well, I... I sound a lot better

1036
01:11:05,106 --> 01:11:06,506
when he's playing with me.

1037
01:11:12,447 --> 01:11:13,746
How's your teaching?

1038
01:11:14,783 --> 01:11:15,716
My teaching?

1039
01:11:15,783 --> 01:11:16,716
Yes.

1040
01:11:16,784 --> 01:11:17,774
It's fine.

1041
01:11:18,786 --> 01:11:20,449
How many classes do you have?

1042
01:11:21,789 --> 01:11:24,784
Well, I have a lighter schedule
so I can focus on my book.

1043
01:11:25,793 --> 01:11:26,887
Your book?

1044
01:11:26,962 --> 01:11:28,123
What is it about?

1045
01:11:29,632 --> 01:11:33,595
Well, it... covers quite a bit,
so it's hard to explain.

1046
01:11:33,669 --> 01:11:35,069
You're almost finished?

1047
01:11:35,137 --> 01:11:36,902
I'm close.

1048
01:11:36,972 --> 01:11:37,962
Ahem.

1049
01:11:40,644 --> 01:11:42,773
You don't like
to talk about your work?

1050
01:11:42,846 --> 01:11:44,782
Mmm, it's, uh... just not a process

1051
01:11:44,848 --> 01:11:47,478
that's easy to talk about
with somebody who's not a writer.

1052
01:11:52,656 --> 01:11:53,646
Oh.

1053
01:11:59,664 --> 01:12:01,156
I shouldn't have
spoken to you like that.

1054
01:12:02,834 --> 01:12:03,824
It's okay.

1055
01:12:24,189 --> 01:12:25,954
- I'll get it, sir.
- Thanks.

1056
01:12:27,527 --> 01:12:28,620
Well...

1057
01:12:28,695 --> 01:12:31,633
um, you have my number
if you need anything.

1058
01:12:31,698 --> 01:12:33,965
Thank you. I'll be fine.

1059
01:12:35,702 --> 01:12:36,635
Here.

1060
01:12:36,702 --> 01:12:38,137
Thank you.

1061
01:12:38,204 --> 01:12:39,137
Have a safe trip.

1062
01:12:39,205 --> 01:12:40,468
Thanks.

1063
01:12:40,541 --> 01:12:41,474
Good-bye.

1064
01:12:41,542 --> 01:12:43,135
Good-bye.

1065
01:13:18,581 --> 01:13:19,640
Good afternoon.

1066
01:13:26,255 --> 01:13:28,521
Hi, Mouna. It's Walter.

1067
01:13:28,591 --> 01:13:32,258
Uh, no. I was, uh, just checking in
to make sure everything was okay.

1068
01:13:33,929 --> 01:13:35,227
Okay. Oh, good.

1069
01:13:35,499 --> 01:13:37,560
Uh, you know... working.

1070
01:13:40,936 --> 01:13:43,203
Okay. So... good.

1071
01:13:44,708 --> 01:13:46,610
Good night.

1072
01:15:27,850 --> 01:15:28,876
Walter.

1073
01:15:29,886 --> 01:15:31,081
Hello.

1074
01:15:31,153 --> 01:15:33,214
I didn't expect you so soon.

1075
01:15:34,223 --> 01:15:36,125
Um, I just was cleaning a bit.

1076
01:15:41,231 --> 01:15:42,995
I love this CD.

1077
01:15:44,068 --> 01:15:45,093
Is it your wife?

1078
01:15:45,169 --> 01:15:46,194
Yes.

1079
01:15:47,338 --> 01:15:48,830
She was beautiful.

1080
01:15:48,906 --> 01:15:49,999
Thank you.

1081
01:15:53,745 --> 01:15:54,804
These are different glasses?

1082
01:15:54,878 --> 01:15:55,937
Mm-hmm.

1083
01:15:56,014 --> 01:15:56,947
They're new?

1084
01:15:57,014 --> 01:15:58,176
They are, yeah.

1085
01:15:58,250 --> 01:16:00,014
They're nice.

1086
01:16:00,085 --> 01:16:01,178
Thank you.

1087
01:16:03,923 --> 01:16:05,984
I was going to cook some lunch.

1088
01:16:06,058 --> 01:16:07,048
Are you hungry?

1089
01:16:07,125 --> 01:16:09,357
Yes. That would be nice.

1090
01:16:09,427 --> 01:16:10,862
Okay.

1091
01:16:19,105 --> 01:16:20,038
Mouna?

1092
01:16:20,105 --> 01:16:21,164
Yes.

1093
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:23,210
Mmm, I was wondering.

1094
01:16:23,275 --> 01:16:24,801
Um, uh, Thursday night.

1095
01:16:24,878 --> 01:16:26,039
Do you have any plans?

1096
01:16:27,413 --> 01:16:30,386
No, Walter. I have no plans.

1097
01:16:30,450 --> 01:16:34,185
Okay. Well, then, I thought...
maybe we might do something.

1098
01:16:35,789 --> 01:16:36,951
Okay.

1099
01:16:37,959 --> 01:16:38,949
Okay.

1100
01:16:46,801 --> 01:16:48,828
- They keep moving people.
- To where?

1101
01:16:48,903 --> 01:16:52,070
I don't know. I think
to other detention centers.

1102
01:16:52,139 --> 01:16:53,869
Two Moroccan guys were just moved.

1103
01:16:53,942 --> 01:16:55,410
They had no idea.

1104
01:16:55,476 --> 01:16:57,173
Suddenly, they were just gone.

1105
01:16:57,245 --> 01:16:59,238
Has anyone said anything to you?

1106
01:16:59,313 --> 01:17:01,146
No. No one in here knows anything.

1107
01:17:03,117 --> 01:17:04,107
This is not fair.

1108
01:17:05,152 --> 01:17:06,849
I am not a criminal.

1109
01:17:06,922 --> 01:17:09,223
I have committed no crime.

1110
01:17:09,291 --> 01:17:10,418
What do they think?

1111
01:17:10,492 --> 01:17:12,428
I'm a terrorist?

1112
01:17:12,494 --> 01:17:14,361
There are no terrorists in here.

1113
01:17:14,430 --> 01:17:16,400
The terrorists have money.
They have support.

1114
01:17:16,465 --> 01:17:17,433
This is just not fair.

1115
01:17:17,499 --> 01:17:20,495
- I know.
- How do you know? You're out there.

1116
01:17:35,351 --> 01:17:37,321
I'm sorry. I... Um...

1117
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:51,134
I sit in here at night, and...

1118
01:17:52,804 --> 01:17:54,467
I keep thinking about Zainab.

1119
01:17:58,343 --> 01:18:01,440
I just want to live my life
and play my music.

1120
01:18:05,217 --> 01:18:06,549
What's so wrong about that?

1121
01:18:14,393 --> 01:18:15,452
Okay.

1122
01:18:16,462 --> 01:18:17,487
Okay. Please do.

1123
01:18:17,563 --> 01:18:18,496
Yeah. Thank you.

1124
01:18:18,564 --> 01:18:19,554
Okay. Bye.

1125
01:18:22,002 --> 01:18:22,992
What did he say?

1126
01:18:23,069 --> 01:18:25,505
That he'd make some calls,

1127
01:18:25,571 --> 01:18:28,510
but they can move him
to another facility at their discretion.

1128
01:18:28,575 --> 01:18:31,137
What facility? Where?

1129
01:18:31,210 --> 01:18:33,306
He said it could be anywhere.

1130
01:18:33,380 --> 01:18:35,509
Upstate Pennsylvania.

1131
01:18:35,582 --> 01:18:37,518
There's even one in Louisiana.

1132
01:18:37,584 --> 01:18:39,178
Louisiana?

1133
01:18:39,253 --> 01:18:40,516
Where they had the floods?

1134
01:18:40,587 --> 01:18:41,577
Mm-hmm.

1135
01:18:41,856 --> 01:18:42,983
But that's too far.

1136
01:18:43,057 --> 01:18:44,252
Yeah.

1137
01:18:46,594 --> 01:18:48,324
Did the lawyer say anything else?

1138
01:18:48,396 --> 01:18:50,593
No. He didn't know anything else.

1139
01:18:54,436 --> 01:18:56,429
It's just like Syria.

1140
01:19:45,157 --> 01:19:46,250
Okay.

1141
01:19:46,324 --> 01:19:48,191
Bye, <i>habibti.</i> Good-bye.

1142
01:19:55,332 --> 01:19:56,596
Sorry to keep you waiting.

1143
01:19:56,668 --> 01:19:58,467
That's okay. How is he?

1144
01:19:58,537 --> 01:20:00,439
He says hello.

1145
01:20:00,505 --> 01:20:03,204
He wants to make sure
you're practicing your drum.

1146
01:20:03,276 --> 01:20:05,337
I am. So...

1147
01:20:06,345 --> 01:20:07,404
You look very nice.

1148
01:20:08,413 --> 01:20:09,939
Thank you.

1149
01:20:10,016 --> 01:20:11,211
You, too.

1150
01:20:11,283 --> 01:20:12,684
Thank you.

1151
01:20:32,206 --> 01:20:34,233
Okay. That's good.

1152
01:20:35,242 --> 01:20:36,175
Thank you, sir.

1153
01:20:37,711 --> 01:20:39,010
You ready?

1154
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:39,979
For what?

1155
01:20:40,048 --> 01:20:41,175
Well...

1156
01:20:41,248 --> 01:20:43,616
uh, I thought we'd go see this.

1157
01:20:45,687 --> 01:20:46,655
Really?

1158
01:20:46,721 --> 01:20:48,314
Yeah.

1159
01:20:48,389 --> 01:20:49,322
Now?

1160
01:20:49,390 --> 01:20:50,722
Yeah. Is that okay?

1161
01:20:52,228 --> 01:20:54,460
Yes. That's wonderful.

1162
01:20:55,530 --> 01:20:56,463
Thank you.

1163
01:20:56,531 --> 01:20:58,091
I'm so excited.

1164
01:20:59,367 --> 01:21:01,530
Okay. Don't move.

1165
01:21:32,269 --> 01:21:33,237
You know...

1166
01:21:33,304 --> 01:21:36,470
I think that show
was really kind of scary.

1167
01:21:36,539 --> 01:21:38,099
It was a little scary. Yeah.

1168
01:21:38,176 --> 01:21:39,337
Yeah.

1169
01:21:41,212 --> 01:21:42,145
Are you finished?

1170
01:21:42,213 --> 01:21:43,682
Yes. Thank you.

1171
01:21:43,748 --> 01:21:44,681
How was everything?

1172
01:21:44,749 --> 01:21:46,548
- Great.
- Very good.

1173
01:21:46,617 --> 01:21:49,350
Actually, I think
I'd like a glass of wine, please.

1174
01:21:49,421 --> 01:21:51,152
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't even think to ask.

1175
01:21:51,223 --> 01:21:52,714
It's okay.

1176
01:21:52,791 --> 01:21:55,193
It's not every night
that you see <i>The Phantom.</i>

1177
01:21:56,227 --> 01:21:57,320
I'll have a Cabernet.

1178
01:21:57,395 --> 01:21:58,328
Cabernet.

1179
01:21:58,398 --> 01:21:59,330
Two, please.

1180
01:21:59,398 --> 01:22:00,593
Excellent.

1181
01:22:00,666 --> 01:22:04,367
Well, I haven't been to the theater
in a long time. Me, neither.

1182
01:22:04,436 --> 01:22:07,738
There's a place in Syria called Malula.

1183
01:22:07,806 --> 01:22:10,676
It's a very big outdoor theater.

1184
01:22:10,743 --> 01:22:11,733
It's beautiful.

1185
01:22:11,811 --> 01:22:15,409
We used to take Tarek there
to see concerts.

1186
01:22:15,481 --> 01:22:18,111
- Here you go. Two Cabernets.
- Thank you.

1187
01:22:18,184 --> 01:22:19,813
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1188
01:22:20,820 --> 01:22:21,753
Well.

1189
01:22:21,821 --> 01:22:23,757
Cheers.

1190
01:22:30,164 --> 01:22:31,393
Mmm.

1191
01:22:31,464 --> 01:22:33,731
Mouna. Um...

1192
01:22:35,669 --> 01:22:38,766
I'm taking a leave of absence...
uh, for the rest of the semester.

1193
01:22:38,839 --> 01:22:39,772
Ahem.

1194
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:41,742
Really? Why?

1195
01:22:41,809 --> 01:22:45,271
Well, I thought I might
spend some more time in New York.

1196
01:22:47,315 --> 01:22:50,584
Walter, you don't
have to do this. You're busy.

1197
01:22:50,652 --> 01:22:52,383
No, I want to.

1198
01:22:53,388 --> 01:22:54,788
But you have to be in Connecticut.

1199
01:22:54,856 --> 01:22:57,293
You have your teaching, your book.

1200
01:22:57,360 --> 01:22:59,421
No, it's fine. Really.

1201
01:22:59,495 --> 01:23:02,467
This is not your problem, Walter.

1202
01:23:03,498 --> 01:23:05,491
It's okay that you're busy.

1203
01:23:08,204 --> 01:23:09,366
I'm not busy.

1204
01:23:11,208 --> 01:23:13,303
Not at all.

1205
01:23:13,377 --> 01:23:17,340
The truth is I haven't done any real work
in a very long time.

1206
01:23:17,414 --> 01:23:20,215
But you just
presented your paper at the conference.

1207
01:23:20,284 --> 01:23:22,778
No. No. No, I didn't even write it.

1208
01:23:22,853 --> 01:23:23,878
I just read it.

1209
01:23:26,556 --> 01:23:28,583
I've been teaching
the same course for 20 years,

1210
01:23:28,658 --> 01:23:30,890
and it... doesn't mean anything to me.

1211
01:23:31,895 --> 01:23:33,364
None of it does.

1212
01:23:36,401 --> 01:23:37,460
I pretend.

1213
01:23:40,738 --> 01:23:43,733
I pretend that I'm busy,
that I'm working, that I'm writing.

1214
01:23:47,579 --> 01:23:49,242
I'm not doing anything.

1215
01:23:55,586 --> 01:23:56,646
I'm sorry.

1216
01:23:57,656 --> 01:23:58,919
Don't be.

1217
01:23:59,191 --> 01:24:01,924
I really appreciate you telling me this.

1218
01:24:08,268 --> 01:24:09,634
Um, Walter.

1219
01:24:11,271 --> 01:24:13,400
What would you do if you didn't teach?

1220
01:24:16,610 --> 01:24:17,942
I don't know.

1221
01:24:18,211 --> 01:24:20,944
It's kind of exciting not to know.

1222
01:24:25,953 --> 01:24:27,444
What time is it?

1223
01:24:27,521 --> 01:24:29,218
Uh, 12:30.

1224
01:24:29,290 --> 01:24:30,884
My God. Is it?

1225
01:24:30,958 --> 01:24:33,555
Yeah. I think that happens
a lot in New York.

1226
01:24:33,627 --> 01:24:34,959
It's...

1227
01:24:35,963 --> 01:24:37,557
Thank you, Walter.

1228
01:24:37,631 --> 01:24:39,692
It was a lovely evening.

1229
01:24:39,767 --> 01:24:43,263
It's the most fun I had in a long time.

1230
01:24:43,338 --> 01:24:45,832
Yeah, I told Tarek
I was taking you tonight, and I did.

1231
01:24:45,908 --> 01:24:47,741
I think he was happy about it.

1232
01:24:48,877 --> 01:24:49,810
Thank you.

1233
01:24:54,650 --> 01:24:55,583
Good night.

1234
01:24:55,651 --> 01:24:56,641
Good night.

1235
01:25:29,687 --> 01:25:31,782
There's a message from Tarek.
Something's wrong.

1236
01:25:31,855 --> 01:25:33,484
What did he say?

1237
01:25:33,557 --> 01:25:35,823
He said they were moving him.
He didn't know what it meant.

1238
01:25:35,894 --> 01:25:37,021
We should go.

1239
01:25:42,867 --> 01:25:44,962
Okay. When do you expect him?

1240
01:25:45,036 --> 01:25:46,471
All right. When he gets in,

1241
01:25:46,539 --> 01:25:48,007
could you have him
call me as soon as possible?

1242
01:25:48,274 --> 01:25:50,540
Uh, please.
It's an emergency. Thank you.

1243
01:25:50,609 --> 01:25:52,306
God, he's still in court.

1244
01:25:52,378 --> 01:25:54,906
Come on, come on,
come on. Can you hurry?

1245
01:25:54,980 --> 01:25:56,642
Sorry, sir.

1246
01:25:56,715 --> 01:25:58,047
I hate this feeling.

1247
01:26:25,079 --> 01:26:28,347
Um... I'm here for bed 38... Tarek Khalil.

1248
01:26:28,416 --> 01:26:30,511
Visiting hours start at 5 p.m.

1249
01:26:30,584 --> 01:26:31,848
What? I'm sorry. Excuse me?

1250
01:26:31,919 --> 01:26:33,980
- Visiting hours are at 5 p.m.
- Oh. Um,

1251
01:26:34,055 --> 01:26:35,080
it... I... I understand.

1252
01:26:35,356 --> 01:26:37,019
But this is e... extremely urgent.

1253
01:26:37,091 --> 01:26:38,355
Could you please check for me?

1254
01:26:41,095 --> 01:26:42,860
Thank you, sir. I appreciate it.

1255
01:26:46,101 --> 01:26:48,094
He is no longer with us.

1256
01:26:49,571 --> 01:26:51,473
Well... wh...

1257
01:26:51,541 --> 01:26:52,566
What does that mean?

1258
01:26:52,641 --> 01:26:54,668
I'm not sure.

1259
01:26:54,743 --> 01:26:55,938
What do you mean you're not su...?

1260
01:26:56,011 --> 01:27:00,043
I mean was he moved to another facility,
another state, what?

1261
01:27:00,116 --> 01:27:01,049
I don't know.

1262
01:27:01,117 --> 01:27:04,385
I just know that that detainee
is no longer at the facility.

1263
01:27:04,454 --> 01:27:07,894
Well, coul... could you please find
someone who... who does know?

1264
01:27:07,957 --> 01:27:09,118
I would appreciate it.

1265
01:27:10,427 --> 01:27:11,588
- Hold on.
- Thank you.

1266
01:27:11,661 --> 01:27:13,027
Thank you very much.

1267
01:27:14,030 --> 01:27:16,057
Yes. Khalil. 38?

1268
01:27:19,136 --> 01:27:20,627
Okay.

1269
01:27:20,704 --> 01:27:21,729
Yes.

1270
01:27:24,475 --> 01:27:25,910
- Sir?
- Yes? Did you find him?

1271
01:27:25,976 --> 01:27:27,069
He's been removed.

1272
01:27:27,144 --> 01:27:28,408
Removed to where?

1273
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:29,709
Deported.

1274
01:27:29,780 --> 01:27:31,009
Deported?

1275
01:27:32,484 --> 01:27:33,474
When?

1276
01:27:34,486 --> 01:27:35,978
He was deported this morning.

1277
01:27:36,988 --> 01:27:38,149
How can that be?

1278
01:27:39,157 --> 01:27:40,147
No, he...

1279
01:27:47,833 --> 01:27:50,168
Um... sir, is, uh...

1280
01:27:51,170 --> 01:27:53,106
Is there any way that I could contact him?

1281
01:27:53,172 --> 01:27:55,108
I don't think so.

1282
01:27:55,174 --> 01:27:57,975
You don't think so.
What kind of an answer is that?

1283
01:27:58,044 --> 01:28:01,107
I'm sorry, sir.
That's all the information that I have.

1284
01:28:01,180 --> 01:28:02,113
Okay.

1285
01:28:02,181 --> 01:28:04,414
Now, please step away from the window?

1286
01:28:06,152 --> 01:28:09,057
You can contact I.C.
if you have any further questions.

1287
01:28:09,122 --> 01:28:10,522
The number's on the wall.

1288
01:28:13,026 --> 01:28:14,119
Sir?

1289
01:28:14,194 --> 01:28:16,187
Step away from the window, please?

1290
01:28:18,699 --> 01:28:23,971
Sir. For the last time,
step away from the window.

1291
01:28:51,901 --> 01:28:54,668
You can't just take people away like that.

1292
01:28:54,738 --> 01:28:56,172
Do you hear me?

1293
01:28:56,238 --> 01:28:59,541
He was a good man, a good person.

1294
01:29:00,577 --> 01:29:02,069
It's not fair!

1295
01:29:03,580 --> 01:29:05,847
We are not just helpless children!

1296
01:29:07,083 --> 01:29:08,244
He had a life!

1297
01:29:10,253 --> 01:29:11,517
Do you hear me?

1298
01:29:11,589 --> 01:29:14,116
Do... I mean do you hear me?

1299
01:29:16,092 --> 01:29:18,188
What's the matter with you?

1300
01:29:18,262 --> 01:29:19,195
Walter.

1301
01:29:19,263 --> 01:29:20,253
What?

1302
01:29:25,603 --> 01:29:26,936
Let's go.

1303
01:29:32,277 --> 01:29:33,711
Let's go.

1304
01:29:33,779 --> 01:29:35,271
There is nothing we can do.

1305
01:29:37,949 --> 01:29:39,281
Let's go, please?

1306
01:30:02,141 --> 01:30:04,077
He did nothing wrong.

1307
01:31:25,396 --> 01:31:26,659
Are you okay?

1308
01:31:33,405 --> 01:31:37,175
Walter, I need to go back to Syria.

1309
01:31:37,242 --> 01:31:39,178
I should be there for Tarek.

1310
01:31:40,746 --> 01:31:42,010
When are you going?

1311
01:31:42,081 --> 01:31:43,640
Tomorrow.

1312
01:31:43,716 --> 01:31:46,984
It's best for me to be there
as soon as possible.

1313
01:31:49,087 --> 01:31:51,250
You won't be able to come back.

1314
01:31:53,426 --> 01:31:54,416
I know.

1315
01:31:58,098 --> 01:31:59,123
Good night.

1316
01:32:02,101 --> 01:32:03,091
Mouna?

1317
01:32:05,773 --> 01:32:06,763
I'm sorry.

1318
01:32:07,775 --> 01:32:09,438
I am so sorry.

1319
01:32:20,121 --> 01:32:21,111
Yes?

1320
01:33:02,332 --> 01:33:04,894
It's my fault what happened to Tarek.

1321
01:33:07,437 --> 01:33:11,172
We did receive the letter
telling us to leave.

1322
01:33:13,510 --> 01:33:15,036
I threw it away.

1323
01:33:17,849 --> 01:33:19,010
I never told him.

1324
01:33:38,037 --> 01:33:41,408
We were here for three years
before the letter arrived.

1325
01:33:44,376 --> 01:33:45,868
I had found a job.

1326
01:33:48,380 --> 01:33:50,282
Tarek was in school.

1327
01:33:53,386 --> 01:33:56,324
Everybody told me not to worry...

1328
01:33:56,389 --> 01:33:58,416
the government didn't care.

1329
01:34:00,193 --> 01:34:02,060
And it appeared to be true.

1330
01:34:05,065 --> 01:34:06,090
And then...

1331
01:34:07,902 --> 01:34:09,234
