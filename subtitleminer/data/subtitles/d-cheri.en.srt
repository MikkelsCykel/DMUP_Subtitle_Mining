<i>We may think ourselves</i>
<i>familiar in this day and age</i>

2
00:00:47,475 --> 00:00:50,007
<i>with the notion that</i>
<i>whores of every description</i>

3
00:00:50,143 --> 00:00:52,634
<i>can very easily</i>
<i>achieve fame and fortune.</i>

4
00:00:52,776 --> 00:00:54,765
<i>But towards the end of the 19th century</i>

5
00:00:54,909 --> 00:00:59,001
<i>in what came to be known in France</i>
<i>as the belle époque,</i>

6
00:00:59,143 --> 00:01:02,939
<i>a select group of courtesans</i>
<i>became, for a short period,</i>

7
00:01:03,076 --> 00:01:08,168
<i>the most celebrated and powerful women</i>
<i>in the long history of prostitution.</i>

8
00:01:09,842 --> 00:01:14,638
<i>There was Émilienne D'Alençon,</i>
<i>who fancied herself as an actress,</i>

9
00:01:14,776 --> 00:01:16,106
<i>but was better known as the woman</i>

10
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:20,039
<i>who'd all but bankrupted</i>
<i>King Leopold II of Belgium.</i>

11
00:01:21,876 --> 00:01:23,341
<i>There was Liane de Pougy,</i>

12
00:01:23,475 --> 00:01:25,839
<i>who, when shown</i>
<i>a million and a half francs worth of jewels</i>

13
00:01:25,976 --> 00:01:27,532
<i>by her lover of the moment</i>

14
00:01:27,676 --> 00:01:29,699
<i>became paralyzed with indecision.</i>

15
00:01:29,842 --> 00:01:33,138
<i>Thus,</i>
<i>obliging him to buy her the entire display.</i>

16
00:01:33,275 --> 00:01:36,208
<i>She later became a nun.</i>

17
00:01:36,609 --> 00:01:37,973
<i>There was La Belle Otero,</i>

18
00:01:38,109 --> 00:01:40,666
<i>Spanish dancer, provoker of suicides</i>

19
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:44,003
<i>and lover of at least</i>
<i>six crowned European monarchs,</i>

20
00:01:44,143 --> 00:01:45,802
<i>whose breasts served as models</i>

21
00:01:45,943 --> 00:01:49,875
<i>for the cupolas</i>
<i>on the new Carlton Hotel at Cannes.</i>

22
00:01:52,842 --> 00:01:55,740
<i>And there was Lea de Lonval.</i>

23
00:01:55,876 --> 00:01:57,501
<i>Born Leone Vallon,</i>

24
00:01:57,642 --> 00:02:01,040
<i>envied by many</i>
<i>as the most beautiful of all.</i>

25
00:02:01,176 --> 00:02:02,539
<i>Her good sense had enabled her</i>

26
00:02:02,676 --> 00:02:05,938
<i>to avoid the most dangerous hazard</i>
<i>facing those of her profession,</i>

27
00:02:06,076 --> 00:02:08,735
<i>namely falling in love.</i>

28
00:02:10,342 --> 00:02:12,808
<i>Now, with the departure</i>
<i>of her most recent lover</i>

29
00:02:12,943 --> 00:02:14,499
<i>to his Russian estates,</i>

30
00:02:14,642 --> 00:02:18,972
<i>Lea, aware that she was not far away</i>
<i>from being a certain age</i>

31
00:02:19,109 --> 00:02:23,268
<i>was beginning to entertain the idea</i>
<i>of retiring.</i>

32
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:26,273
Is there anything in the world
more wonderful

33
00:02:26,409 --> 00:02:30,865
than a bed all to oneself?

34
00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:34,773
- Good night, madame.
- Mm, good night, Rose.

35
00:02:39,542 --> 00:02:41,371
<i>Headquarters of the belle époque</i>

36
00:02:41,509 --> 00:02:42,805
<i>was Maxim's restaurant</i>

37
00:02:42,943 --> 00:02:45,704
<i>whose maître d'</i>
<i>possessed an indispensable notebook</i>

38
00:02:45,842 --> 00:02:49,239
<i>containing a long list of names</i>
<i>of available women.</i>

39
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:51,171
More Pommery.

40
00:02:51,309 --> 00:02:53,867
Pommery is on its way, Fred.

41
00:02:54,342 --> 00:02:56,308
<i>One of his most regular customers</i>

42
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:59,136
<i>was Fred Peloux, known as Chéri,</i>

43
00:02:59,275 --> 00:03:04,799
<i>the rich but neglected son</i>
<i>of another celebrated courtesan.</i>

44
00:03:09,143 --> 00:03:13,007
<i>As the only child of a woman</i>
<i>focused obsessively on her career,</i>

45
00:03:13,143 --> 00:03:18,370
<i>Chéri had led a solitary</i>
<i>and often confusing life.</i>

46
00:03:18,809 --> 00:03:20,934
<i>Now, at the age of 19,</i>

47
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:24,735
<i>truth be told, after several years</i>
<i>of conscientious debauchery,</i>

48
00:03:24,876 --> 00:03:27,899
<i>he was exhausted enough</i>
<i>to be starting himself to think longingly</i>

49
00:03:28,043 --> 00:03:29,906
<i>of the notion of retirement.</i>

50
00:03:45,275 --> 00:03:46,400
<i>Every so often,</i>

51
00:03:46,542 --> 00:03:49,565
<i>Lea de Lonval found it necessary</i>
<i>to rise early</i>

52
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:53,073
<i>and prepare herself</i>
<i>as if for gladiatorial combat.</i>

53
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:57,108
Oh, Rose, why did I agree to have lunch
with that dreadful woman

54
00:03:57,242 --> 00:04:00,538
in that hideous mausoleum?

55
00:04:04,142 --> 00:04:07,870
To the Palace of Varieties, Ernest.

56
00:04:10,676 --> 00:04:11,767
<i>Like most women</i>

57
00:04:11,909 --> 00:04:14,466
<i>who have devoted their lives</i>
<i>to various forms of love</i>

58
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:18,169
<i>and been ostracized from polite society</i>
<i>as a result,</i>

59
00:04:18,309 --> 00:04:24,333
<i>Lea now found herself confined</i>
<i>to an extremely narrow circle of friends.</i>

60
00:04:27,609 --> 00:04:30,769
<i>Today, she was visiting</i>
<i>her former colleague, Charlotte,</i>

61
00:04:30,909 --> 00:04:33,466
<i>once one</i>
<i>of her most ruthless competitors,</i>

62
00:04:33,609 --> 00:04:35,905
<i>a woman of legendary astuteness</i>
<i>and skill</i>

63
00:04:36,043 --> 00:04:39,975
<i>at extracting immense sums</i>
<i>from her clients.</i>

64
00:04:40,108 --> 00:04:41,870
<i>Normally ravenous for gossip,</i>

65
00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:47,236
<i>today Charlotte was preoccupied</i>
<i>with a particular problem of her own.</i>

66
00:04:48,275 --> 00:04:50,503
That child will be the death of me.

67
00:04:50,642 --> 00:04:54,006
- The death of me.
- Charlotte, that child is 19.

68
00:04:54,142 --> 00:04:57,131
Can you remember
what a gorgeous little boy he was?

69
00:04:57,275 --> 00:04:58,707
All those curls.

70
00:05:00,043 --> 00:05:02,235
I expect I remember better than you.

71
00:05:02,642 --> 00:05:04,904
I can't imagine what you mean.

72
00:05:05,676 --> 00:05:08,198
Sometimes I wonder
if it's the same person.

73
00:05:08,342 --> 00:05:10,274
Black circles under his eyes.

74
00:05:10,409 --> 00:05:13,035
Doesn't get up
till the middle of the afternoon.

75
00:05:13,175 --> 00:05:16,664
Never stopped nagging me
until I bought him a new motorcar.

76
00:05:17,142 --> 00:05:20,040
And I used to think of myself
as such a happy mother.

77
00:05:20,175 --> 00:05:22,471
We all have our cross to bear.

78
00:05:22,609 --> 00:05:23,802
To tell you the truth,

79
00:05:23,943 --> 00:05:26,000
I was hoping
you might have a word with him.

80
00:05:26,142 --> 00:05:27,199
I?

81
00:05:27,342 --> 00:05:29,968
He's always thought of you
as a kind of godmother.

82
00:05:30,108 --> 00:05:32,370
He pays no attention to me anymore.

83
00:05:32,509 --> 00:05:34,873
But I'm sure he'll listen
to anything you have to say.

84
00:05:37,976 --> 00:05:40,635
"No more than ten cigarettes a day,"
he said.

85
00:05:40,776 --> 00:05:43,742
And brandy only at the weekend.
He said it was my heart.

86
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:45,569
So there is one.

87
00:05:49,542 --> 00:05:53,440
- Nounoune.
- Chéri.

88
00:05:54,209 --> 00:05:56,767
What time do you call this
to be making an appearance?

89
00:05:56,909 --> 00:05:59,272
- Oh, my God, who's that?
- Don't start that.

90
00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:02,705
Ah, yes, you're my mother, aren't you?

91
00:06:02,842 --> 00:06:06,433
I vaguely remember meeting you
a few times when I was little.

92
00:06:06,576 --> 00:06:08,098
That's not at all amusing.

93
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:10,333
I was told you were seen in a bar
last week

94
00:06:10,475 --> 00:06:11,997
sitting on old Lili's knee.

95
00:06:12,142 --> 00:06:14,472
Don't be ridiculous.
Lili hasn't got any knees.

96
00:06:14,609 --> 00:06:16,336
They disappeared years ago.

97
00:06:16,475 --> 00:06:17,566
You see what I mean?

98
00:06:17,976 --> 00:06:19,134
Show me your tongue.

99
00:06:21,876 --> 00:06:23,239
You shouldn't drink gin.

100
00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:28,238
- Or brandy.
- Well, it wouldn't be polite

101
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:31,136
to let my mother drink alone,
now would it?

102
00:06:31,576 --> 00:06:32,973
You don't look at all well.

103
00:06:33,108 --> 00:06:36,597
You're quite right, Lea.
He's a bag of bones. A bag of bones.

104
00:06:36,742 --> 00:06:38,833
- I feel fine.
- You're a bad color.

105
00:06:38,975 --> 00:06:41,134
Distinctly green about the gills.

106
00:06:42,042 --> 00:06:44,941
I meant to ask you,
my dear, are you free on Sunday?

107
00:06:45,075 --> 00:06:47,303
No, I'm going down
to my house in Normandy tomorrow.

108
00:06:47,442 --> 00:06:49,567
- With Speleieff?
- No, that's over.

109
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:53,266
Speleieff's gone back to Russia.
Do concentrate.

110
00:06:53,409 --> 00:06:54,636
Your memory, Chéri.

111
00:06:54,776 --> 00:06:57,435
We went to the farewell dinner
a couple of months ago.

112
00:06:57,576 --> 00:06:59,201
Ah, yes. We had langoustine.

113
00:06:59,342 --> 00:07:01,501
I could just do with a plate of them now.

114
00:07:01,642 --> 00:07:06,165
One minute he won't eat,
the next he's asking for langoustine.

115
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:09,300
Which one are you taking to Normandy
with you?

116
00:07:10,642 --> 00:07:12,232
I'm going on my own.

117
00:07:12,975 --> 00:07:14,737
Nice to be so rich.

118
00:07:14,876 --> 00:07:16,637
You're welcome to come if you like.

119
00:07:16,776 --> 00:07:20,606
There's nothing to do there
but eat, drink and sleep.

120
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:24,274
Where is this place?

121
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:30,671
It's just down the coast from Honfleur.

122
00:07:34,742 --> 00:07:37,037
I'm so exhausted all the time.

123
00:07:37,175 --> 00:07:40,266
I said you don't look at all well.

124
00:07:41,642 --> 00:07:43,608
Pfft, pfft, pfft!

125
00:07:43,876 --> 00:07:46,398
Do you good
to spend some time in the country.

126
00:07:46,542 --> 00:07:47,599
Just simple things.

127
00:07:47,742 --> 00:07:50,003
Grilled chicken,
strawberries and cream.

128
00:07:50,142 --> 00:07:51,472
No women.

129
00:07:51,609 --> 00:07:53,734
- No women? Sounds irresistible.
- Ha-ha-ha.

130
00:07:57,075 --> 00:08:01,098
Has anyone ever explained to you
why your eyes are so beautiful?

131
00:08:01,242 --> 00:08:02,299
No.

132
00:08:02,442 --> 00:08:04,999
It's because they're shaped like a sole.

133
00:08:06,709 --> 00:08:09,334
Like a sole, the fish.

134
00:08:09,809 --> 00:08:13,332
This end, you see, by your nose
is the head of the sole.

135
00:08:13,475 --> 00:08:15,407
And the upper curve is the back.

136
00:08:15,542 --> 00:08:19,030
And the lower line here is the flat belly.

137
00:08:19,175 --> 00:08:20,664
- I see.
- Yes.

138
00:08:20,809 --> 00:08:24,536
If it were curved under the eyes
as well as above it,

139
00:08:24,676 --> 00:08:26,301
it would be shaped like a flounder.

140
00:08:26,442 --> 00:08:27,738
And then you would look stupid.

141
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:31,308
Well, well,
you learn something every day.

142
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:36,841
These are heavy.

143
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:38,601
Yes.

144
00:08:42,442 --> 00:08:43,567
Mm.

145
00:08:43,709 --> 00:08:46,902
Why did I start calling you Nounoune,
can you remember?

146
00:08:47,042 --> 00:08:48,099
I don't know.

147
00:08:48,242 --> 00:08:51,436
You were 6 at the time
and not disposed to discuss your reasons.

148
00:08:51,576 --> 00:08:53,303
Is that when you christened me Chéri?

149
00:08:53,442 --> 00:08:57,807
Well, I expect I thought
one good nickname deserved another.

150
00:09:00,108 --> 00:09:01,802
Kiss me.

151
00:09:05,242 --> 00:09:06,867
Kiss me.

152
00:09:20,275 --> 00:09:23,673
I'm not sure that was very intelligent.

153
00:09:27,342 --> 00:09:29,672
Oh, what? Oh...?

154
00:09:29,808 --> 00:09:32,138
You think I've never kissed
a handsome mouth before?

155
00:09:32,676 --> 00:09:36,301
You think
that's going to make me lose control?

156
00:09:37,142 --> 00:09:39,108
I mean, even if we were to...

157
00:09:39,242 --> 00:09:42,231
Not that I can see that happening.

158
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:44,603
Well, you raised the subject.

159
00:09:48,342 --> 00:09:51,274
Let's say no more about this, shall we?

160
00:10:08,142 --> 00:10:11,165
The garden smells beautiful
this evening.

161
00:10:13,409 --> 00:10:15,637
It's the rose acacia.

162
00:10:25,175 --> 00:10:26,300
Come here.

163
00:12:06,908 --> 00:12:09,136
Mm.

164
00:12:30,175 --> 00:12:31,902
Nounoune.

165
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:49,638
- Don't lose your temper.
- I'm not.

166
00:12:49,775 --> 00:12:51,900
Yes. Fatal mistake for a boxer.

167
00:12:52,042 --> 00:12:53,632
- I'm not a boxer.
- Come on.

168
00:12:53,775 --> 00:12:56,105
- Come on.
- Unh. Unh!

169
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:58,307
No, you're not.

170
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:07,932
I've known your mother
since she was in the Corps de Ballet.

171
00:13:08,342 --> 00:13:12,399
I first met her
when she was just beginning to realize

172
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:16,633
that art lovers are a more reliable source
of income than art.

173
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:22,838
I can't honestly say I've ever liked her.

174
00:13:22,975 --> 00:13:24,907
Nobody does.

175
00:13:31,075 --> 00:13:32,302
Ah!

176
00:13:34,641 --> 00:13:37,540
But you know our profession.

177
00:13:37,675 --> 00:13:41,573
We're really not able
to make friends outside of it.

178
00:13:43,209 --> 00:13:46,198
Women who do what we do,

179
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:51,640
no one else would ever understand.

180
00:13:55,475 --> 00:13:57,565
Say something.

181
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:59,106
What?

182
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:01,773
Tell me something about yourself.

183
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:05,074
Nothing to tell.

184
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:07,939
Uh...!

185
00:14:23,108 --> 00:14:25,438
He'll never make a boxer.

186
00:14:26,008 --> 00:14:29,236
I didn't take him on for his boxing skills,
Patron.

187
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,499
No, of course you didn't.

188
00:14:31,641 --> 00:14:33,903
It's strange.

189
00:14:34,309 --> 00:14:35,501
I can't describe it.

190
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:40,199
It's like being in bed
with an African or a Chinese.

191
00:14:40,342 --> 00:14:43,637
Not that I've ever had that experience.

192
00:14:43,775 --> 00:14:46,333
Oh, I'm sorry, Patron,
am I embarrassing you?

193
00:14:46,474 --> 00:14:47,735
Not at all, madame.

194
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:49,171
I can't criticize his character,

195
00:14:49,309 --> 00:14:51,570
mainly because
he doesn't seem to have one.

196
00:14:52,442 --> 00:14:54,737
All the other young men
I've had to do with

197
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:59,205
can't wait to tell you
all their innermost secrets.

198
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:02,438
He never says a word.

199
00:15:02,575 --> 00:15:07,406
There's something about him,
something mysterious, I can't explain.

200
00:15:10,508 --> 00:15:12,531
We were just talking about you.

201
00:15:12,675 --> 00:15:14,301
If I were a woman, Monsieur Chéri,

202
00:15:14,442 --> 00:15:17,635
I think I'd say,
"I'll come back in ten years time."

203
00:15:20,942 --> 00:15:23,170
Wouldn't do you much good, would it?

204
00:15:25,808 --> 00:15:27,569
Do you enjoy being spiteful?

205
00:15:28,342 --> 00:15:31,172
I always find it cheers me up, yes.

206
00:15:32,175 --> 00:15:37,505
Few weeks, Patron. Just a few weeks,
then I'll send him on his way.

207
00:15:38,209 --> 00:15:39,606
<i>But she didn't,</i>

208
00:15:39,741 --> 00:15:42,935
<i>and six years later</i>
<i>they were still together.</i>

209
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:44,768
<i>This was something</i>
<i>of a surprise to her,</i>

210
00:15:44,908 --> 00:15:46,806
<i>but the truth is</i>
<i>she felt entirely comfortable</i>

211
00:15:46,942 --> 00:15:49,340
<i>with a companion</i>
<i>so embedded in her own milieu</i>

212
00:15:49,474 --> 00:15:52,736
<i>that he required of her</i>
<i>no pretence whatsoever.</i>

213
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:54,068
<i>Both of them were dimly aware</i>

214
00:15:54,209 --> 00:15:56,936
<i>that this state of affairs</i>
<i>could not go on indefinitely.</i>

215
00:15:57,075 --> 00:16:01,064
<i>But for now, they were lulled</i>
<i>by the soothing routines of habit.</i>

216
00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:02,266
<i>Every so often,</i>

217
00:16:02,408 --> 00:16:06,431
<i>a disapproving world would draw attention</i>
<i>to the unsuitability of their life together.</i>

218
00:16:06,575 --> 00:16:07,632
<i>They would take note,</i>

219
00:16:07,775 --> 00:16:09,139
<i>and then once again fall back</i>

220
00:16:09,275 --> 00:16:12,434
<i>into the comfortable bickering</i>
<i>of an old married couple.</i>

221
00:16:13,075 --> 00:16:14,438
Can I have it?

222
00:16:14,575 --> 00:16:16,666
It looks just as good on me
as it does on you.

223
00:16:19,508 --> 00:16:23,600
Ugh, take if off,
you'll wear out the thread.

224
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:26,870
Whoever it was gave you these,
he wasn't kidding.

225
00:16:27,008 --> 00:16:29,940
Did you hear what I said? Take it off.

226
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:32,998
It'd make a wonderful wedding present.

227
00:16:33,142 --> 00:16:35,074
Who for?
- For me.

228
00:16:35,209 --> 00:16:37,800
Who do you think for? For me.

229
00:16:38,474 --> 00:16:40,100
You're just scared I'll make off with it.

230
00:16:40,242 --> 00:16:42,003
No, but I know you.

231
00:16:42,142 --> 00:16:46,471
If I were to offer it to you,
you're quite capable of accepting.

232
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:51,673
Well, why wouldn't I?

233
00:16:52,342 --> 00:16:54,069
You can't say I don't look good in them.

234
00:16:54,741 --> 00:16:56,764
If I did, you wouldn't believe me.

235
00:16:58,408 --> 00:17:00,431
Don't scrunch up your nose like that
when you laugh.

236
00:17:00,575 --> 00:17:03,598
- You'll give yourself wrinkles.
- Not for a while.

237
00:17:05,641 --> 00:17:09,403
You know, you can look
really ugly sometimes, you know that?

238
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:11,564
You're lying.

239
00:17:17,474 --> 00:17:18,997
- It's a minority view.
- Ha, ha.

240
00:17:21,942 --> 00:17:25,033
- No, none of that this morning.
- Yes.

241
00:17:25,175 --> 00:17:28,629
No, you're having lunch with the harpy,
your mother.

242
00:17:28,775 --> 00:17:31,264
Oh, God. And it's already 20 to 12.

243
00:17:31,408 --> 00:17:33,204
- Are you coming?
- No, I've been let off.

244
00:17:33,341 --> 00:17:34,739
I wasn't invited.

245
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:36,136
- Really?
- Mm.

246
00:17:36,275 --> 00:17:38,173
Strange.

247
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:40,570
I thought so too.

248
00:17:42,308 --> 00:17:43,934
I've been ordered to join you for tea.

249
00:17:46,008 --> 00:17:47,871
Marie Laure is coming.

250
00:17:48,008 --> 00:17:50,872
With that ghastly daughter of hers.

251
00:17:51,008 --> 00:17:52,997
Her daughter is very pretty.

252
00:17:53,142 --> 00:17:56,733
And clever enough
not to be as pretty as Marie Laure.

253
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,807
If you say so.

254
00:17:59,341 --> 00:18:02,172
Rose. Run my bath.

255
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:09,564
Ugh, I hate it when you wear a veil.

256
00:18:10,142 --> 00:18:12,903
Really, have you no manners?

257
00:18:13,341 --> 00:18:16,330
Never reproach a woman
for wearing a veil.

258
00:18:17,008 --> 00:18:18,496
She always has her reasons.

259
00:18:18,641 --> 00:18:21,130
Marie Laure, as beautiful as ever.

260
00:18:21,274 --> 00:18:23,797
Lea, I don't know if you remember
my daughter, Edmée.

261
00:18:23,942 --> 00:18:25,373
Of course, I do.

262
00:18:25,508 --> 00:18:28,031
- Have you left school?
- Well, of course she has.

263
00:18:28,175 --> 00:18:30,436
What would a lovely girl of 19
want with school?

264
00:18:30,575 --> 00:18:31,768
- Eighteen.
- Eighteen.

265
00:18:31,908 --> 00:18:33,204
Eighteen. That's what I meant.

266
00:18:33,341 --> 00:18:35,432
Marie Laure,
you're one of the only women I know

267
00:18:35,575 --> 00:18:38,439
- who could carry off that color.
- Ha, ha.

268
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:42,940
- Well, I think it's time we were going.
- Surely not. It's still early.

269
00:18:43,075 --> 00:18:45,234
No, well,
the child is not very used to company.

270
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:48,034
Only because she's had to lead
such a solitary life.

271
00:18:48,175 --> 00:18:50,367
Why don't you all come to lunch
on Thursday.

272
00:18:50,508 --> 00:18:52,838
- I can do that.
- I'll have to check.

273
00:18:52,975 --> 00:18:55,702
- Say goodbye, Edmée.
- Chéri will show you out.

274
00:18:55,841 --> 00:18:57,238
On your feet, lazybones.

275
00:18:57,374 --> 00:18:59,567
Lovely to see you.

276
00:19:07,641 --> 00:19:10,199
Delightful pair. Delightful.

277
00:19:10,341 --> 00:19:12,534
Marie Laure certainly looks magnificent.

278
00:19:12,675 --> 00:19:14,903
Yes, she was very beautiful in her day.

279
00:19:15,042 --> 00:19:18,031
And she can carry off
that awful color of puce.

280
00:19:18,175 --> 00:19:21,005
I suppose she's right
about Edmée being 18.

281
00:19:21,142 --> 00:19:24,699
Yes, she had her the year
after she got that enormous pink diamond

282
00:19:24,841 --> 00:19:27,238
out of Khalil Bey and left him flat.

283
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:30,602
We always thought that singing teacher
must be the father, didn't we?

284
00:19:31,942 --> 00:19:34,305
Shall we take a turn
around the grounds?

285
00:19:38,308 --> 00:19:40,240
I need to have a word with you
about Chéri.

286
00:19:40,374 --> 00:19:42,102
- I thought as much.
- Ha, ha.

287
00:19:42,241 --> 00:19:44,469
As you know,
I've never stood in your way.

288
00:19:44,608 --> 00:19:46,733
On the contrary,
I've always been grateful to you.

289
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:49,966
- So I should hope. He's cost me enough.
- Ha-ha-ha.

290
00:19:50,274 --> 00:19:53,070
You know me.
I'm very content with my lot.

291
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:54,834
I have everything I need.

292
00:19:54,975 --> 00:19:57,338
Not that we haven't worked hard for it,
both of us.

293
00:19:57,474 --> 00:19:58,997
- You know what I'm saying.
- Mm.

294
00:19:59,142 --> 00:20:00,539
But lately...

295
00:20:00,675 --> 00:20:02,641
- Yes?
- I've been thinking about what's missing

296
00:20:02,775 --> 00:20:03,832
from my life.

297
00:20:03,975 --> 00:20:05,032
Oh, not love, surely?

298
00:20:05,174 --> 00:20:07,333
You're always saying how happy you are
to be rid of it.

299
00:20:07,474 --> 00:20:09,838
Ah, ha, goodness, yes.

300
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:13,270
No,
I mean something altogether different.

301
00:20:14,841 --> 00:20:16,238
Grandchildren.

302
00:20:20,341 --> 00:20:22,069
Grandchildren?

303
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:24,800
I'm arranging a marriage for Chéri.

304
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:29,566
- Has he been told?
- Of course, he has.

305
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:32,173
- Hasn't he said anything to you?
- No.

306
00:20:32,308 --> 00:20:35,433
Ha, ha, oh, what a dreadful boy he is.

307
00:20:35,575 --> 00:20:37,598
I mean,
of course, it's not as if there's any rush.

308
00:20:38,575 --> 00:20:40,632
Oh, you mean,
it's not happening right away?

309
00:20:40,775 --> 00:20:41,832
Oh, good heavens, no.

310
00:20:41,975 --> 00:20:43,941
End of next month.

311
00:20:45,075 --> 00:20:48,234
Ah. You've made a deal
with Marie Laure.

312
00:20:48,374 --> 00:20:50,306
It wasn't easy.

313
00:20:50,441 --> 00:20:53,134
She's hard as nails, that one.
Hard as nails.

314
00:20:53,274 --> 00:20:54,638
She wanted separate bank accounts.

315
00:20:54,775 --> 00:20:56,434
- Can you imagine?
- Easily.

316
00:20:56,575 --> 00:20:58,165
Anyway, it's all arranged now.

317
00:20:58,308 --> 00:21:00,399
What a wonderful life
they're going to have.

318
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:03,939
- Youth, beauty, money.
- Ha-ha-ha.

319
00:21:04,075 --> 00:21:05,665
What's so funny?

320
00:21:05,808 --> 00:21:10,206
You're throwing Edmée to Chéri
like a Christian to the lions,

321
00:21:10,341 --> 00:21:12,500
and you think she's going to have
a wonderful life?

322
00:21:12,641 --> 00:21:15,402
Wh...? What do you mean?
He's the kindest, sweetest...

323
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:17,530
- What do you know about him?
- I'm his mother.

324
00:21:17,675 --> 00:21:19,641
Since when?

325
00:21:19,975 --> 00:21:21,406
I'm sorry, Lea.

326
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:23,973
I'm sorry. How very clumsy of me.

327
00:21:24,107 --> 00:21:25,698
- I've upset you.
- Not in the least.

328
00:21:25,841 --> 00:21:29,364
- Well, naturally, it's come as a shock.
- No, Charlotte, not at all.

329
00:21:29,508 --> 00:21:32,303
I've been expecting it.
I've been expecting it for years.

330
00:21:32,441 --> 00:21:34,407
I've been expecting you
to come and take him away,

331
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:37,030
and hand him over
to some other loose woman.

332
00:21:37,174 --> 00:21:40,470
Oh, Lea, that's a very ugly expression.

333
00:21:40,608 --> 00:21:42,733
I don't think so.

334
00:21:45,741 --> 00:21:48,536
You have nothing to worry about,
Charlotte.

335
00:21:49,042 --> 00:21:52,405
You're getting him back
in very good condition.

336
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:55,405
I've kept him away from opium,
and cocaine

337
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:58,030
and the cheaper sort of drink.

338
00:21:58,408 --> 00:22:01,374
I believe you'll find
he's a credit to both of us.

339
00:22:01,508 --> 00:22:03,269
I'm sure.

340
00:22:03,408 --> 00:22:06,636
It doesn't mean that little girl
is going to be able to handle him.

341
00:22:06,775 --> 00:22:09,570
- Young women have their methods.
- You may be right.

342
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:12,538
- I can't say I remember.
- Ha.

343
00:22:12,975 --> 00:22:14,964
You were worried,
weren't you, Charlotte?

344
00:22:15,107 --> 00:22:16,733
Admit it.

345
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:19,670
You were afraid
I was going to bleed all over you.

346
00:22:19,808 --> 00:22:22,399
I was only afraid of one thing.

347
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:25,803
- That I might cause you suffering.
- Ha-ha-ha.

348
00:22:25,942 --> 00:22:28,032
Oh, that's right. Laugh at me.

349
00:22:28,174 --> 00:22:30,333
Laugh at me
and call me an old romantic.

350
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:32,463
All I want
is to see the young people happy.

351
00:22:32,608 --> 00:22:35,574
Oh, you always were
disgustingly sentimental.

352
00:22:35,708 --> 00:22:39,265
Oh, come here. Oh.

353
00:22:46,308 --> 00:22:48,968
You smell so good.

354
00:22:49,441 --> 00:22:50,498
Don't you find,

355
00:22:50,641 --> 00:22:56,232
now the skin's a little less firm,
it holds perfume so much better?

356
00:23:07,608 --> 00:23:10,039
The least you could have done
was tell me yourself.

357
00:23:10,174 --> 00:23:12,333
She wanted to tell you.

358
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:15,304
She thought it would come better
from her.

359
00:23:21,708 --> 00:23:24,003
You and your mother
have been cooking this up for months.

360
00:23:24,141 --> 00:23:27,130
- Why are you giving me a hard time?
- Because you're a coward.

361
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,067
How much is she worth?

362
00:23:32,208 --> 00:23:33,572
A million and a half.

363
00:23:35,107 --> 00:23:37,767
- From her father?
- How should I know?

364
00:23:37,908 --> 00:23:40,135
She doesn't know who her father is
any more than I do.

365
00:23:40,274 --> 00:23:43,866
All I know is,
she's worth a million an a half.

366
00:23:44,007 --> 00:23:47,098
- And you?
- Oh, I'm worth far more than that.

367
00:23:47,241 --> 00:23:50,639
So you'll have more than enough.

368
00:23:51,074 --> 00:23:53,336
More than enough?

369
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:56,864
You and I don't think about money
the same way, Nounoune.

370
00:23:57,007 --> 00:24:01,269
How much do you think you've saved
while I've been paying for everything?

371
00:24:01,408 --> 00:24:04,431
Fifty thousand a year? Sixty?

372
00:24:04,575 --> 00:24:07,097
Multiplied by six.

373
00:24:08,041 --> 00:24:10,007
Haven't I been worth it?

374
00:24:21,575 --> 00:24:24,938
Anyway, she certainly is very pretty.

375
00:24:26,775 --> 00:24:29,138
She seems quite bright.

376
00:24:31,308 --> 00:24:33,069
What's your impression?

377
00:24:33,208 --> 00:24:35,197
I have no idea.

378
00:24:35,341 --> 00:24:37,500
I expect I'll find out sooner or later.

379
00:24:37,641 --> 00:24:40,368
How does she feel about you?

380
00:24:42,941 --> 00:24:45,737
She admires me.

381
00:24:46,308 --> 00:24:48,706
Loves me as far as I can tell.

382
00:24:48,841 --> 00:24:50,807
- She doesn't say much.
- Mm.

383
00:24:51,141 --> 00:24:53,471
- What about you?
- I didn't say anything.

384
00:24:54,308 --> 00:24:57,502
I see, it's a real love match.

385
00:24:57,641 --> 00:25:00,607
Why do we have to talk about her?
You're the one I'm worried about.

386
00:25:00,741 --> 00:25:03,332
Me? Why?

387
00:25:03,474 --> 00:25:07,839
- What are you going to do?
- What am I going to do?

388
00:25:07,974 --> 00:25:11,600
What, do you mean,
what am I going to do now?

389
00:25:37,974 --> 00:25:40,338
You're so beautiful.

390
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:46,407
A good body lasts a long time.

391
00:25:47,041 --> 00:25:49,564
Everyone knows that.

392
00:26:01,974 --> 00:26:03,963
Are you going to be all right?

393
00:26:04,107 --> 00:26:06,039
Of course I am.

394
00:26:06,174 --> 00:26:10,038
It'll be wonderful not to find
all the towels floating in 6 inches of water

395
00:26:10,174 --> 00:26:13,867
every time I come into the bathroom.

396
00:26:14,007 --> 00:26:16,633
I think I'll have it redecorated.

397
00:26:19,641 --> 00:26:21,072
What do you expect me to do?

398
00:26:21,208 --> 00:26:23,265
Go and pine away in Normandy?

399
00:26:23,408 --> 00:26:24,873
Stop dyeing my hair?

400
00:26:25,007 --> 00:26:26,633
- Is that what you want?
- Yes.

401
00:26:26,774 --> 00:26:28,967
You're not the first young man
I've said goodbye to.

402
00:26:29,107 --> 00:26:32,834
Yes, I know, but what I thought might
be appropriate is if I were the last.

403
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:34,829
I'm only thinking of you.

404
00:26:36,807 --> 00:26:38,171
If it's any consolation,

405
00:26:38,308 --> 00:26:40,967
I've been with you longer
than anyone else in my life.

406
00:26:41,107 --> 00:26:44,073
And I've certainly never devoted
as much time and consideration

407
00:26:44,208 --> 00:26:46,299
to the end of any of my affairs.

408
00:26:46,441 --> 00:26:49,737
But you can't expect me
to curl up and die.

409
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:53,163
When is the wedding, anyway?

410
00:26:53,308 --> 00:26:55,638
September the 25th.

411
00:26:56,274 --> 00:26:58,137
You seem very casual about it.

412
00:26:58,274 --> 00:26:59,830
Why not? It's all been arranged.

413
00:27:00,241 --> 00:27:03,207
Ceremony at 2.
Reception at mother's house.

414
00:27:03,341 --> 00:27:05,966
Sleeper to Italy.
Honeymoon by the lakes.

415
00:27:06,107 --> 00:27:08,471
- Do people still go to the lakes?
- They do.

416
00:27:08,608 --> 00:27:12,506
- And what about the girl?
- What about her? She'll be there.

417
00:27:12,907 --> 00:27:15,271
And I won't be.

418
00:27:16,974 --> 00:27:19,497
Nounoune, you'll always be there.

419
00:27:20,041 --> 00:27:21,973
I mean,
you know, in case I need anything.

420
00:27:24,408 --> 00:27:26,737
You are to be kind to her,
do you hear me?

421
00:27:27,907 --> 00:27:30,237
Don't make her suffer.

422
00:27:30,374 --> 00:27:32,636
It's her turn now.

423
00:27:33,141 --> 00:27:35,164
Mine is over.

424
00:27:35,608 --> 00:27:36,937
That's not what I want.

425
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,271
Oh, I'm afraid, from now on,

426
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:43,896
what you want
has very little to do with anything.

427
00:27:48,241 --> 00:27:50,173
We'll get Rose to help you pack.

428
00:27:50,575 --> 00:27:52,097
What? Why?

429
00:27:52,241 --> 00:27:55,503
You're getting married next month.
There will be a lot of preparations,

430
00:27:55,641 --> 00:27:58,198
which you'll need to be making
from home.

431
00:27:58,341 --> 00:27:59,398
But...

432
00:27:59,541 --> 00:28:03,598
Can you imagine how rich I'm going to be
when I don't have to pay for you anymore?

433
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,070
What about my replacement?

434
00:28:05,208 --> 00:28:08,402
Oh, some loose change
and a packet of cigarettes.

435
00:28:08,541 --> 00:28:12,734
And a Kir Royal on Sundays,
if he behaves himself.

436
00:28:25,241 --> 00:28:26,729
Say something.

437
00:28:27,274 --> 00:28:29,502
- Nounoune.
- What?

438
00:28:30,974 --> 00:28:32,997
Just say something.

439
00:28:36,508 --> 00:28:37,633
Come on.

440
00:28:37,774 --> 00:28:40,536
Let's go shopping one last time.

441
00:28:40,674 --> 00:28:41,731
What for?

442
00:28:41,874 --> 00:28:44,397
Your wedding present, of course.

443
00:28:44,541 --> 00:28:47,904
There is a big pink pearl at Schwabe's.

444
00:28:48,041 --> 00:28:50,234
Ha, ha, pink?

445
00:28:50,374 --> 00:28:54,999
Ah, let's go for something
a little more masculine, shall we?

446
00:28:55,141 --> 00:28:57,073
A regular white pearl.

447
00:28:57,208 --> 00:28:59,901
I think I know the very one.

448
00:29:10,674 --> 00:29:12,334
Amen.

449
00:30:04,541 --> 00:30:05,767
What do you think?

450
00:30:06,174 --> 00:30:08,140
Beautiful.

451
00:30:10,374 --> 00:30:11,771
When did you get this?

452
00:30:11,907 --> 00:30:13,600
Today.

453
00:30:16,074 --> 00:30:18,665
Isn't that a little flaw?

454
00:30:18,807 --> 00:30:21,898
It's tiny. You have a very good eye.

455
00:30:22,041 --> 00:30:23,666
I've been very well-trained.

456
00:30:23,807 --> 00:30:26,637
Wonderful color, isn't it?

457
00:30:27,241 --> 00:30:29,139
Does this mean
there's someone new in your life?

458
00:30:30,041 --> 00:30:33,132
No, I bought it myself.

459
00:30:33,341 --> 00:30:36,273
Eleven thousand six hundred.

460
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:39,166
Now, ladies and gentlemen.

461
00:30:39,308 --> 00:30:40,933
Ready?

462
00:30:42,107 --> 00:30:43,437
Oh!

463
00:30:44,408 --> 00:30:46,067
I'm so sorry I have to rush off.

464
00:30:46,208 --> 00:30:49,072
Goodbye, Edmée. Fred.

465
00:30:49,208 --> 00:30:50,867
Enjoy yourselves in Italy.

466
00:30:51,007 --> 00:30:52,496
Bye.

467
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:57,273
I suppose we're lucky
she got off her back for a couple of hours.

468
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,266
Darling.

469
00:31:05,408 --> 00:31:07,737
Wonderful to see you.

470
00:31:09,374 --> 00:31:11,703
I must have been sad before
like this, Rose.

471
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,703
Can you remember?

472
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,863
After little Lequellec, perhaps?

473
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:18,473
No, madame,
it was Monsieur Bacciocchi.

474
00:31:18,607 --> 00:31:19,766
Oh.

475
00:31:19,907 --> 00:31:23,703
- You cried for days.
- I was only 28 then.

476
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,738
My mistake was keeping Chéri
for six years.

477
00:31:26,874 --> 00:31:28,170
Being with someone for six years

478
00:31:28,308 --> 00:31:31,103
is like following your husband
to the colonies.

479
00:31:31,241 --> 00:31:33,832
Time you come back, you've forgotten
what you're supposed to wear,

480
00:31:33,974 --> 00:31:36,769
and nobody remembers who you are.

481
00:31:36,907 --> 00:31:38,839
Do you mind opening the window?

482
00:31:38,974 --> 00:31:40,167
Is that a good idea?

483
00:31:40,308 --> 00:31:42,035
It's really stuffy in here.

484
00:31:42,174 --> 00:31:43,969
I don't like doing it.

485
00:31:44,107 --> 00:31:45,868
It would be so easy for somebody
to climb in.

486
00:31:46,007 --> 00:31:48,996
Oh, promises, promises.

487
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,238
I'm sure I should be telling you lovebirds
something,

488
00:32:00,374 --> 00:32:02,703
but I can't think for the life of me what.

489
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,897
Hardly surprising.

490
00:32:04,041 --> 00:32:08,030
Isn't this the first time
anyone's ever been married in our family?

491
00:32:08,374 --> 00:32:10,635
Goodbye, darling.

492
00:32:10,774 --> 00:32:12,740
Goodbye.

493
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:15,699
All aboard.

494
00:32:16,507 --> 00:32:17,632
Goodbye, darling.

495
00:32:18,574 --> 00:32:20,563
Goodbye.

496
00:34:09,174 --> 00:34:11,662
How old are you anyway?

497
00:34:12,473 --> 00:34:15,530
I told you, I'm 19 in January.

498
00:34:16,607 --> 00:34:18,505
It's obscene.

499
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,538
Well, you're only 25.

500
00:34:26,807 --> 00:34:29,602
Twenty-five years old.

501
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:34,205
I don't know why I find it shocking
that you're so much younger than me.

502
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:39,330
You have such beautiful eyes, Fred.

503
00:34:42,274 --> 00:34:44,637
Yes. Do you know why?

504
00:34:44,774 --> 00:34:46,865
Is it because I love them?

505
00:34:47,307 --> 00:34:48,466
No, it's not.

506
00:34:48,874 --> 00:34:52,328
It's because my eye
is shaped like a sole.

507
00:35:20,074 --> 00:35:21,937
When you're finished with that hat,
Madame Lea,

508
00:35:22,074 --> 00:35:23,131
I hope you'll think of me.

509
00:35:23,273 --> 00:35:24,899
That blue one that you gave me,
remember?

510
00:35:25,041 --> 00:35:26,370
It lasted me two years.

511
00:35:26,507 --> 00:35:29,268
I can just see you in that hat, Aldonza.

512
00:35:29,407 --> 00:35:31,339
I hope you don't run
into any pregnant women.

513
00:35:31,473 --> 00:35:33,234
I know what suits me,
thank you very much.

514
00:35:33,373 --> 00:35:36,169
I wore a hat very like that
when I danced <i>Sylvia</i>

515
00:35:36,307 --> 00:35:39,138
at the Turkish gala in the '89 exhibition.

516
00:35:39,273 --> 00:35:40,739
Do you remember, Charlotte?

517
00:35:40,874 --> 00:35:43,601
No, I left halfway through the evening
with Count Orloff,

518
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,501
and didn't get back for two years.

519
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:48,800
I don't know how you could go off
like that with a strange man.

520
00:35:48,941 --> 00:35:50,770
All men are strange.

521
00:35:51,141 --> 00:35:53,265
Hear, hear.
- Yes, but I mean to say...

522
00:35:53,407 --> 00:35:55,396
Shut up and deal.

523
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:57,972
Ow, oh! My arthritis.

524
00:35:58,107 --> 00:36:02,300
And to think I used
to have the most beautiful hands.

525
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:06,930
King Alfonso XII used to drink
from my cupped palms.

526
00:36:07,074 --> 00:36:09,972
He called them
his mother-of-pearl seashells.

527
00:36:10,107 --> 00:36:12,164
I always thought
he was one of the duller kings.

528
00:36:12,307 --> 00:36:15,001
He adored my hair,
down below my knees.

529
00:36:15,141 --> 00:36:16,697
Monsieur de Thou, the deputy,

530
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:20,704
used to say there was enough hair
to carpet the stairway to heaven.

531
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,499
- And now what's left?
- A very nice wig.

532
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,469
Are you all right, Lea, my dear?

533
00:36:25,607 --> 00:36:27,664
You don't seem quite your usual self.

534
00:36:27,807 --> 00:36:29,137
No, I'm fine.

535
00:36:29,273 --> 00:36:31,103
Except for having eaten that vast meal.

536
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,604
I'm going to have to go on a diet.

537
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:36,171
- Oh. Haven't you suffered enough?
- What...?

538
00:36:38,974 --> 00:36:40,269
Oh, you mean that.

539
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:42,703
No, I wish it worked that way.

540
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,931
I'd give up any number of young men
if it meant I could lose a few kilos.

541
00:36:47,473 --> 00:36:50,303
You're amazing, Lea.
There's nobody like you.

542
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,167
Keep your eyes on the cards.

543
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,906
Have you ever seen weather
like this in October?

544
00:36:56,041 --> 00:36:57,870
You're right, it's extraordinary.

545
00:36:58,007 --> 00:37:02,064
And if it's like this here, just imagine
what it must be like in Italy.

546
00:37:05,041 --> 00:37:06,233
Are you all right, my dear?

547
00:37:06,373 --> 00:37:08,999
I'm just going
to get a breath of fresh air.

548
00:37:55,907 --> 00:37:57,532
Lea. Lea.

549
00:37:57,674 --> 00:37:59,765
Come back, they've arrived.

550
00:37:59,907 --> 00:38:00,964
Who?

551
00:38:01,106 --> 00:38:02,766
The happy couple.

552
00:38:06,807 --> 00:38:09,069
Lea. Lea, darling, it's been,

553
00:38:09,207 --> 00:38:10,332
mm, ages.

554
00:38:10,473 --> 00:38:13,132
And this is Prince Guido,
the love of my life.

555
00:38:13,273 --> 00:38:14,364
Perhaps you've already met.

556
00:38:14,507 --> 00:38:16,769
- Yes, of course, of course, madame.
- No, don't slobber.

557
00:38:16,907 --> 00:38:18,532
Oh, he's gorgeous, isn't he?

558
00:38:18,674 --> 00:38:21,105
A touch of restraint
wouldn't come amiss, Lili.

559
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,399
No, no, Baronne,
don't be such a curmudgeon.

560
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:24,767
Please, sit.

561
00:38:24,907 --> 00:38:27,532
They're very sweet together.

562
00:38:27,674 --> 00:38:29,367
They remind me of the children.

563
00:38:29,507 --> 00:38:31,302
That's why we came,
to ask how they were.

564
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,804
- How was the wedding?
- Glorious, glorious.

565
00:38:33,941 --> 00:38:36,964
A riot of orange blossom,
and the bride looked like a dream.

566
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:38,800
A Madonna. A Madonna.

567
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:41,270
And my boy was walking on air.

568
00:38:41,407 --> 00:38:43,373
What news of the honeymoon?

569
00:38:43,507 --> 00:38:45,769
- Italy, the lakes.
- Oh, idyllic.

570
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:50,100
Yes, I remember when General Petrescu
took me to Florence and Venice.

571
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,468
- In a coach?
- No, no, by train.

572
00:38:52,607 --> 00:38:55,801
Weren't they horribly uncomfortable,
those early trains?

573
00:38:55,941 --> 00:38:58,930
Not like the ones
my Chéri and Edmée have been taking.

574
00:38:59,073 --> 00:39:01,904
Don't you have any more colorful details
for us?

575
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,233
Oh. I can't think what you mean.

576
00:39:04,373 --> 00:39:06,896
I'm sorry, it's my weakness.

577
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,438
Guido will tell you that I adore it
when he talks dirty.

578
00:39:10,574 --> 00:39:13,062
Speaking of which,
do we think that Marie Laure

579
00:39:13,207 --> 00:39:15,173
gave the bride any words of advice?

580
00:39:15,307 --> 00:39:16,967
Marie Laure couldn't wait to get away.

581
00:39:17,106 --> 00:39:19,732
I wouldn't think she'd ever had
such a thing as a conversation

582
00:39:19,874 --> 00:39:21,737
with her daughter in her life.

583
00:39:21,874 --> 00:39:26,169
Then did no one give the poor
little thing her instructions for newlyweds?

584
00:39:26,307 --> 00:39:30,399
In this day and age, Lili,
people know what they're doing.

585
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:32,904
At least, my Chéri does.

586
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,301
Doesn't he, darling?

587
00:39:35,307 --> 00:39:37,739
Of course, Guido and I
would get married tomorrow

588
00:39:37,874 --> 00:39:39,203
if he were of age.

589
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:40,533
Really, Lili?

590
00:39:40,674 --> 00:39:43,606
Then I'd be a real princess,
wouldn't I, Guido?

591
00:39:46,307 --> 00:39:48,796
He always calls me his <i>principessa.</i>

592
00:39:48,941 --> 00:39:50,429
Don't you, darling?

593
00:39:50,574 --> 00:39:53,540
The only problem is his father.

594
00:39:53,674 --> 00:39:56,162
My father is the duke of Parese.

595
00:39:56,307 --> 00:39:58,899
He says if I marry Lili,
he'll put me in a convent.

596
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,472
- A convent?
- Sounds delicious.

597
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:03,368
Oh, come here, my darling.

598
00:40:03,507 --> 00:40:06,302
Come and kiss me. Mm!

599
00:40:07,207 --> 00:40:10,401
Oh, yes. Ha-ha-ha.

600
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,729
- Oh!
- Oh, I'm sorry.

601
00:40:12,874 --> 00:40:14,897
Don't worry.
It's good luck, spilling a glass.

602
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,563
Unless, of course, it's colored glass.

603
00:40:16,707 --> 00:40:17,764
I have to leave.

604
00:40:17,907 --> 00:40:19,270
Why? Where's the fire?

605
00:40:19,407 --> 00:40:23,032
Well, I'm not sure
there's a delicate answer to that.

606
00:40:23,173 --> 00:40:24,571
You don't mean...?

607
00:40:24,707 --> 00:40:26,195
What? Already?

608
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,431
Thank you for lunch.

609
00:40:27,574 --> 00:40:29,506
You can't leave us
in suspense like this.

610
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:30,799
No, tell us, tell us.

611
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:32,270
You've got to tell us everything.

612
00:40:32,407 --> 00:40:34,873
No, it's too early in the day.
It has to be a secret.

613
00:40:35,006 --> 00:40:36,302
What? Wha...?

614
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,031
For the time being at least.

615
00:40:39,874 --> 00:40:41,396
Wha...?

616
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:54,563
Good evening, madame.

617
00:40:59,574 --> 00:41:02,301
I'll need a fire in my room tonight, Rose.

618
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,497
The heat is on, madame, but of course.

619
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,503
And I'll need a hot water bottle as well.

620
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,799
Just some toast and grapes for dinner.

621
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:12,065
Tell Marcel to do me
that chocolate with an egg yolk beaten in.

622
00:41:12,207 --> 00:41:14,070
Yes, madame.

623
00:41:47,607 --> 00:41:48,936
Mm!

624
00:42:05,173 --> 00:42:08,162
Chéri.

625
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:34,435
You're up very early this morning,
madame.

626
00:42:34,574 --> 00:42:36,164
Are you all right?

627
00:42:36,307 --> 00:42:37,568
Not really.

628
00:42:37,707 --> 00:42:39,002
What's the matter?

629
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:42,129
You know, age.

630
00:42:48,873 --> 00:42:50,601
You know what we're going to do,
Rose?

631
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:54,802
We're going to get in the car
and drive down to Biarritz.

632
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:56,770
Towards the sun.

633
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,502
<i>My dear Charlotte,</i>

634
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:12,765
<i>I'm sorry to slip away</i>
<i>without saying a proper goodbye.</i>

635
00:43:12,906 --> 00:43:16,236
<i>I am probably making</i>
<i>a complete fool of myself.</i>

636
00:43:16,373 --> 00:43:17,838
<i>But then again, why not?</i>

637
00:43:17,973 --> 00:43:19,269
<i>Life is short.</i>

638
00:43:19,407 --> 00:43:21,600
<i>Let's do our best to enjoy it.</i>

639
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:24,672
<i>Remember me to the boy</i>
<i>when he comes back.</i>

640
00:43:24,806 --> 00:43:28,466
<i>P.S., don't bother</i>
<i>to try bribing my butler.</i>

641
00:43:28,607 --> 00:43:34,005
<i>No one in my household</i>
<i>knows anything about this escapade.</i>

642
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:37,937
So, what did he say?

643
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:40,766
He said that he wasn't going
to be able to come along to see us

644
00:43:40,906 --> 00:43:42,769
for at least another 18 months.

645
00:43:44,073 --> 00:43:45,198
Madame.

646
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:49,738
<i>The Hotel Grand Palais</i>
<i>in Biarritz had, for some years now,</i>

647
00:43:49,873 --> 00:43:52,567
<i>been a happy hunting ground</i>
<i>for Lea and her like.</i>

648
00:43:52,707 --> 00:43:53,797
Put those over there.

649
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:57,031
<i>A place where you might</i>
<i>easily find yourself shoulder to shoulder</i>

650
00:43:57,173 --> 00:43:59,298
<i>with the British prime minister.</i>

651
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:03,804
<i>Or in some more intimate posture,</i>
<i>with the Prince of Wales.</i>

652
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:09,831
<i>However, this time, it was not a customer</i>
<i>Lea was on the lookout for,</i>

653
00:44:09,973 --> 00:44:12,303
<i>it was a consolation.</i>

654
00:44:33,473 --> 00:44:35,836
Madam, monsieur.

655
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,429
Have you seen Jocelyn?

656
00:45:21,739 --> 00:45:25,331
Won't you join my son and me
for a pot of tea, madame?

657
00:45:25,607 --> 00:45:29,596
That's so kind. I'd be delighted.

658
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:40,402
Welcome home, darling.

659
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:41,869
How are you?

660
00:45:42,006 --> 00:45:44,598
How are you?
Let me have a look at you.

661
00:45:44,739 --> 00:45:46,330
Oh, you're not looking at all well.

662
00:45:46,473 --> 00:45:50,166
- Two days on the train. I'm fine.
- Are you all right, dear?

663
00:45:50,307 --> 00:45:52,330
I've been feeling a bit tired.
- Good, good.

664
00:45:52,473 --> 00:45:54,371
But you must tell me
what's the matter with him.

665
00:45:54,507 --> 00:45:58,996
Have you been looking after him properly?
He's looking positively sinister.

666
00:46:14,273 --> 00:46:17,670
Thank you.
Thank you for a most wonderful evening.

667
00:46:22,606 --> 00:46:26,369
I don't suppose you'd care
for a nightcap, would you?

668
00:46:40,773 --> 00:46:42,296
Ah.

669
00:46:42,773 --> 00:46:44,671
What was the date on the letter?

670
00:46:44,806 --> 00:46:48,761
- What letter is that, darling?
- The letter from Lea, as you well know.

671
00:46:48,906 --> 00:46:51,065
Oh, I'm not sure.

672
00:46:51,207 --> 00:46:53,832
Sometime
around the beginning of October.

673
00:46:53,973 --> 00:46:56,996
And you say you don't know who it is?

674
00:46:57,140 --> 00:46:58,401
Who what is, my love?

675
00:46:59,806 --> 00:47:01,965
The man she went away with.

676
00:47:02,106 --> 00:47:03,402
This is the thing.

677
00:47:04,273 --> 00:47:07,262
Nobody knows. A total mystery.

678
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:08,633
Of course, you know me.

679
00:47:08,773 --> 00:47:11,467
I've been able to make a few inquiries.

680
00:47:11,606 --> 00:47:12,765
And?

681
00:47:13,639 --> 00:47:17,094
He's young. Very young, I'm told.

682
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:20,070
Not someone you'd boast about,
but very...

683
00:47:20,207 --> 00:47:24,230
Mm. You know, handsome.

684
00:47:30,573 --> 00:47:33,472
Be some muscle-bound boxer
if I know anything.

685
00:47:34,839 --> 00:47:37,862
Good to have some decent coffee
at last after all that Italian muck.

686
00:47:38,839 --> 00:47:40,237
Do you like my new outfit?

687
00:47:40,606 --> 00:47:42,266
How do I look in this bonnet?

688
00:47:42,873 --> 00:47:46,237
Like an old convict.
Enough to give anyone a fright.

689
00:47:49,073 --> 00:47:50,936
Oh, it goes without saying

690
00:47:51,073 --> 00:47:53,164
you're welcome to stay here
as long as you like.

691
00:47:53,307 --> 00:47:54,533
As long as you like.

692
00:47:54,673 --> 00:47:58,401
I can't stay here.
I'm allergic to rag and bone shops.

693
00:47:58,539 --> 00:48:00,301
I don't know where else
you're going to stay.

694
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:03,803
They haven't nearly finished
your house.

695
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:13,237
Bastard builder says it's going
to take another four months.

696
00:48:13,373 --> 00:48:15,565
Look at them. Four months.

697
00:48:15,706 --> 00:48:17,332
Pull away.

698
00:48:19,407 --> 00:48:22,430
- Fred?
- What?

699
00:48:22,806 --> 00:48:25,295
Doesn't she live near here?

700
00:48:25,739 --> 00:48:27,830
Other side of the park.

701
00:48:28,806 --> 00:48:31,398
You go back.
I have just thought of something.

702
00:48:35,373 --> 00:48:38,339
- All right, Marcel?
- Monsieur Peloux.

703
00:48:38,739 --> 00:48:42,137
- Hard at work as ever.
- Very nice to see you again, sir.

704
00:48:42,273 --> 00:48:44,500
I hope madame is well.

705
00:48:45,106 --> 00:48:47,936
Couldn't really tell you, sir.
We've only had the odd postcard.

706
00:48:48,073 --> 00:48:50,595
- Where from?
- Not rightly sure, sir.

707
00:48:50,739 --> 00:48:53,103
We send all her mail to the lawyer
and he forwards it.

708
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:03,605
Money between us, sir?
There's no need for that.

709
00:49:04,673 --> 00:49:08,071
Anyway, can't tell you what I don't know.

710
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,229
I could give you the name
of madame's lawyer.

711
00:49:10,373 --> 00:49:12,100
No, it's all right.

712
00:49:13,606 --> 00:49:16,436
- When will she be back?
- No idea, sir.

713
00:49:16,573 --> 00:49:18,335
Whenever she feels like it.

714
00:49:18,739 --> 00:49:21,899
We keep the place ticking over
just in case.

715
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:24,199
But, you know,
I wouldn't be in the least surprised

716
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:25,703
if you said to me now:

717
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:27,998
"There she is
coming around the corner."

718
00:49:37,806 --> 00:49:42,239
So finally,
the whole thing was just up to mother.

719
00:49:42,373 --> 00:49:45,032
But I found it so powerful.

720
00:49:45,173 --> 00:49:47,604
- It was so powerful. Moving.
- Yes.

721
00:49:47,739 --> 00:49:50,500
To my core,
I've never had an experience like it.

722
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:53,728
I'll go and see how cook is doing
with the duck.

723
00:49:53,873 --> 00:49:56,464
We'll have to try
and put a bit of flesh on you, Lea.

724
00:49:56,606 --> 00:49:58,902
You're a bag of bones.

725
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:02,767
Are you having trouble with your memory,
Madame Peloux? Occasional blackouts?

726
00:50:02,906 --> 00:50:05,667
- What can you mean?
- You called Edmée Lea.

727
00:50:05,806 --> 00:50:08,295
It's the third time you've done it today.

728
00:50:08,439 --> 00:50:09,496
Don't mind me, dear.

729
00:50:09,639 --> 00:50:12,730
I have so much on my mind,
I can scarcely remember my own name.

730
00:50:12,873 --> 00:50:15,498
No one's ever as busy as the person
with nothing to do.

731
00:50:22,173 --> 00:50:24,434
Perhaps you should send her
on a rest cure.

732
00:50:24,973 --> 00:50:26,632
Thank you for defending me.

733
00:50:26,773 --> 00:50:30,364
Or was it her you were defending,
my predecessor?

734
00:50:33,372 --> 00:50:36,134
You're not scared
of my illustrious mother, are you?

735
00:50:36,273 --> 00:50:38,262
When a door slams,
it can give you a shock.

736
00:50:39,106 --> 00:50:42,004
But it's not as frightening as the snake
that slides under the door.

737
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:43,435
You mean, your mother?

738
00:50:43,573 --> 00:50:45,539
I don't know
if you could call her a mother.

739
00:50:45,673 --> 00:50:47,798
She never noticed me
until I started to look pretty,

740
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:50,133
and then she couldn't wait
to get rid of me.

741
00:50:51,273 --> 00:50:53,636
I just got left
with all Madame Peloux's friends.

742
00:50:53,773 --> 00:50:55,932
That's why I know how to do petit point.

743
00:50:56,073 --> 00:50:58,937
Or, look, old Madame Aldonza
from the ballet

744
00:50:59,073 --> 00:51:01,971
showed me how to do
an entrechat quatre.

745
00:51:12,773 --> 00:51:16,001
So I suppose we're both orphans, really.

746
00:51:18,173 --> 00:51:20,071
Yes, that's right.

747
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:24,867
Orphans.

748
00:51:30,906 --> 00:51:33,303
Chéri, what's the matter?

749
00:51:36,839 --> 00:51:38,805
You called me Chéri.

750
00:51:39,539 --> 00:51:41,562
Well, you're frightening me.

751
00:51:42,306 --> 00:51:44,295
Are you all right, Fred?

752
00:51:45,606 --> 00:51:48,868
Yes, it's just the thought
of our being orphans, that's all.

753
00:52:20,306 --> 00:52:23,534
Why do you always turn your back
on me?

754
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:32,872
You haven't been listening
to a word I've been saying.

755
00:52:33,006 --> 00:52:34,403
What?

756
00:52:35,773 --> 00:52:37,636
You never listen to what anyone says.

757
00:52:40,639 --> 00:52:43,332
I expect you were thinking
about your Lea.

758
00:52:45,106 --> 00:52:47,731
Yes, as a matter of fact I was.

759
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:11,828
I hate you.

760
00:53:12,372 --> 00:53:15,066
You don't love me. You never loved me.

761
00:53:15,206 --> 00:53:19,161
You're hardly even aware I exist.
You're a degenerate.

762
00:53:20,172 --> 00:53:23,297
All you ever think about
is that old woman.

763
00:53:31,306 --> 00:53:35,932
- I'm sorry you find me so boring.
- It's not that.

764
00:53:36,073 --> 00:53:38,664
- It's just I have no idea what it is you want.
- What I want?

765
00:53:38,806 --> 00:53:40,102
- Listen.
- No.

766
00:53:40,239 --> 00:53:41,967
No, I don't want one of your lectures.

767
00:53:42,106 --> 00:53:44,970
I don't want to be told
why I'm too young to know what's going on

768
00:53:45,106 --> 00:53:47,663
or why your eye is shaped like a mullet.

769
00:53:47,806 --> 00:53:48,965
A sole.

770
00:53:53,606 --> 00:53:57,004
I just can't understand
why you're so aggrieved.

771
00:53:58,272 --> 00:54:00,966
Do I go out on my own in the evening?

772
00:54:01,739 --> 00:54:03,602
Do I sleep in a separate bedroom?

773
00:54:05,206 --> 00:54:08,105
- Am I having an affair?
- How would I know?

774
00:54:09,573 --> 00:54:12,505
Don't you like the way I make love
to you?

775
00:54:15,339 --> 00:54:17,703
You call that love?

776
00:54:17,873 --> 00:54:19,930
Oh, God.

777
00:54:20,073 --> 00:54:21,971
Oh, my God.

778
00:54:24,006 --> 00:54:27,460
Mm, oh, my God. Oh, God.

779
00:54:28,139 --> 00:54:31,469
Oh, God. Mm. Mm.

780
00:54:32,206 --> 00:54:33,638
<i>At times of insecurity,</i>

781
00:54:33,773 --> 00:54:36,705
<i>Chéri's instinct was to return</i>
<i>like a homing pigeon</i>

782
00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:39,032
<i>to the familiar distractions of Maxim's.</i>

783
00:54:39,172 --> 00:54:41,297
Good evening.
Is the Vicomte Desmond in this evening?

784
00:54:41,439 --> 00:54:42,496
Chéri.

785
00:54:42,639 --> 00:54:45,071
<i>The impersonal friendship,</i>
<i>the exaggerated laughter,</i>

786
00:54:45,206 --> 00:54:48,138
<i>the clink of glasses</i>
<i>and the sound of gypsy violins.</i>

787
00:54:48,272 --> 00:54:49,966
Fred. Well, well, well.

788
00:54:50,105 --> 00:54:51,935
Mind if I join you?
- Delighted.

789
00:54:52,072 --> 00:54:54,095
What are you drinking now
you're an old married man?

790
00:54:54,239 --> 00:54:55,296
Chamomile tea?

791
00:54:55,439 --> 00:54:57,132
Pommery as usual.

792
00:54:57,272 --> 00:54:58,636
Something else to get you started?

793
00:54:58,773 --> 00:55:01,898
Pommery first. Pommery last.

794
00:55:16,072 --> 00:55:17,436
Can I ask you a favor?

795
00:55:17,573 --> 00:55:19,471
Of course. What?

796
00:55:19,606 --> 00:55:22,902
Make a call to Neuilly.
Ask for my mother.

797
00:55:23,039 --> 00:55:24,903
Tell her I'm having dinner with you.

798
00:55:25,039 --> 00:55:28,006
Suppose I get Madame Peloux,
your wife.

799
00:55:28,139 --> 00:55:31,333
Tell her the same thing.
She's very well-trained.

800
00:55:31,906 --> 00:55:34,633
Who is that woman staring at me?

801
00:55:34,906 --> 00:55:36,531
You know, that's La Loupiote.

802
00:55:36,673 --> 00:55:42,004
A friend of Lea's or a colleague,
I suppose, once upon a time.

803
00:56:02,005 --> 00:56:03,904
You didn't even say hello to me.

804
00:56:04,039 --> 00:56:06,335
Hello. How are you?

805
00:56:07,339 --> 00:56:09,737
Some people have all the luck,
don't they?

806
00:56:09,873 --> 00:56:13,305
Pretty as a picture and rolling in money.

807
00:56:23,606 --> 00:56:26,071
All the luck and no clue
what to do with it.

808
00:56:29,573 --> 00:56:31,505
Get off home back to your mommy.

809
00:56:32,773 --> 00:56:34,568
Poor boy.

810
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:41,737
Evening, monsieur.

811
00:56:48,139 --> 00:56:50,469
It was a splendid evening.

812
00:56:50,773 --> 00:56:53,330
I thought we were going out.

813
00:56:53,472 --> 00:56:56,336
- I'm going up to bed.
- Oh?

814
00:56:58,439 --> 00:57:00,996
I'm going to take a room here.

815
00:57:03,606 --> 00:57:05,196
You go.

816
00:57:12,239 --> 00:57:15,103
And how long will you be staying,
monsieur?

817
00:57:15,539 --> 00:57:17,402
I don't know.

818
00:57:17,873 --> 00:57:20,805
Let's just take it one day at a time,
shall we?

819
00:58:31,939 --> 00:58:35,531
Shall I introduce you to the English girl?

820
00:58:36,639 --> 00:58:38,104
No.

821
00:58:40,139 --> 00:58:44,595
I tell you,
she knows some amazing tricks.

822
00:58:45,739 --> 00:58:47,136
I said no.

823
00:58:50,105 --> 00:58:52,935
Can I do something for you, my dear?

824
00:58:53,072 --> 00:58:55,265
Shall I make you a pipe?

825
00:58:57,806 --> 00:58:59,431
No, thank you.

826
00:58:59,573 --> 00:59:02,061
I'll have some cocaine.

827
00:59:06,673 --> 00:59:08,934
I'm so sorry.

828
00:59:09,739 --> 00:59:12,034
I know what the trouble is.

829
00:59:12,172 --> 00:59:14,400
You have everything
you can possibly want.

830
00:59:15,905 --> 00:59:18,394
And none of it means a thing.

831
00:59:25,105 --> 00:59:28,128
The thing is, I don't know where she is.

832
00:59:29,339 --> 00:59:31,271
Or who she's with.

833
00:59:38,272 --> 00:59:39,897
It's all right, you don't need to worry.

834
00:59:46,573 --> 00:59:47,766
They're fake.

835
01:00:35,905 --> 01:00:37,768
I'll go.

836
01:00:47,472 --> 01:00:48,699
What is it?

837
01:00:48,838 --> 01:00:51,703
Lea. May I come up and see you?

838
01:00:51,838 --> 01:00:52,895
I'm busy.

839
01:00:53,905 --> 01:00:55,098
Just for a few minutes.

840
01:00:55,239 --> 01:00:57,171
I don't think so. Not this evening.

841
01:00:57,772 --> 01:00:59,432
Later perhaps.
At the end of the evening.

842
01:00:59,939 --> 01:01:02,405
Give my regards to your mother.

843
01:01:18,573 --> 01:01:20,004
Oh, it's you.

844
01:01:22,172 --> 01:01:24,001
How long is this going to go on?

845
01:01:24,139 --> 01:01:26,162
I don't know.

846
01:01:26,306 --> 01:01:28,135
It's been nearly three weeks now.

847
01:01:28,272 --> 01:01:30,737
Poor little Edmée is frantic with worry.

848
01:01:30,872 --> 01:01:33,566
On the contrary,
her letter was extremely calm.

849
01:01:33,705 --> 01:01:35,569
What letter? Show it to me.

850
01:01:35,705 --> 01:01:37,671
- I threw it away.
- Ugh.

851
01:01:37,805 --> 01:01:41,999
But she said she'd wait to hear from me
and sent regards from all your friends.

852
01:01:42,905 --> 01:01:45,303
Looks like Marie Laure
really did bring her up properly.

853
01:01:45,439 --> 01:01:46,802
Oh, you'll be the death of me.

854
01:01:46,939 --> 01:01:48,928
I strongly doubt it.

855
01:01:53,239 --> 01:01:55,603
Who is it, my darling?

856
01:01:55,772 --> 01:01:58,102
You can tell me.

857
01:02:13,406 --> 01:02:14,599
Rose.

858
01:02:14,738 --> 01:02:16,727
It's a postcard from old Lili.

859
01:02:16,872 --> 01:02:21,998
Chéri, Monsieur Peloux, has run off.

860
01:02:22,139 --> 01:02:24,537
Oh, he's left his wife.

861
01:02:24,805 --> 01:02:28,669
Can't say it comes
as any surprise to me, madame.

862
01:02:29,172 --> 01:02:31,763
I dare say the divorce will be more fun
than the wedding.

863
01:02:36,105 --> 01:02:38,900
That goes straight up to madame's room.

864
01:02:40,072 --> 01:02:41,799
- Straighten that one.
- Right.

865
01:02:49,539 --> 01:02:51,095
Bring that bag up.

866
01:02:51,239 --> 01:02:52,898
Come along.

867
01:03:19,672 --> 01:03:21,400
Francois.

868
01:03:22,072 --> 01:03:24,163
Francois.

869
01:03:26,672 --> 01:03:27,729
Monsieur.

870
01:03:28,772 --> 01:03:31,295
Take this lot into the house for me,
would you?

871
01:03:34,072 --> 01:03:36,038
They're for Madame Peloux.

872
01:03:39,705 --> 01:03:41,433
My wife.

873
01:03:58,805 --> 01:04:00,668
Are you back now?

874
01:04:02,905 --> 01:04:04,428
Yes.

875
01:04:05,972 --> 01:04:07,461
Yes.

876
01:04:09,905 --> 01:04:11,700
Back for good.

877
01:04:25,972 --> 01:04:28,370
Three hundred and twenty francs
for Vaseline.

878
01:04:28,505 --> 01:04:31,336
What does Ernest do? Drink it?

879
01:04:33,805 --> 01:04:35,566
We ought to burn all of these.

880
01:04:42,772 --> 01:04:47,137
Twice yesterday,
I thought I saw Chéri on the street.

881
01:04:52,206 --> 01:04:54,728
Do you think he'll ever come back?

882
01:04:54,872 --> 01:04:57,168
I couldn't say, madame.

883
01:04:58,072 --> 01:04:59,299
Do you want him to?

884
01:04:59,439 --> 01:05:01,734
No, I saved him once.

885
01:05:01,872 --> 01:05:04,702
I couldn't do it all over again.

886
01:05:08,206 --> 01:05:09,865
Do you think I should change my hair?

887
01:05:19,605 --> 01:05:21,094
Madame.

888
01:05:33,339 --> 01:05:34,634
- Charlotte.
- Lea.

889
01:05:34,772 --> 01:05:37,829
You're back home.
And Chéri's back home as well.

890
01:05:37,972 --> 01:05:40,529
Back with his lovely wife.

891
01:05:40,905 --> 01:05:42,427
The young couple
are happier than ever.

892
01:05:42,572 --> 01:05:46,027
So all is well with the world.

893
01:05:48,738 --> 01:05:50,295
I don't know if you heard.

894
01:05:50,438 --> 01:05:52,996
But he disappeared on us
for weeks on end.

895
01:05:53,405 --> 01:05:55,395
We had no idea where he was.

896
01:05:55,538 --> 01:05:57,970
We were worried sick.

897
01:05:58,105 --> 01:05:59,832
Anyway, that's all in the past.

898
01:05:59,972 --> 01:06:01,199
What a relief.

899
01:06:01,339 --> 01:06:05,566
I must say, my dear.
You look more beautiful than ever.

900
01:06:06,772 --> 01:06:09,364
I don't know how you manage it.

901
01:06:09,505 --> 01:06:12,131
But, of course, you know,
Chéri was just sowing a few wild oats.

902
01:06:12,272 --> 01:06:13,737
Is that so?

903
01:06:13,872 --> 01:06:15,565
I wouldn't dream of blaming you,

904
01:06:15,705 --> 01:06:17,228
but you had such a tight hold on him.

905
01:06:17,372 --> 01:06:19,564
With any luck,
he'll have got it out of his system.

906
01:06:19,705 --> 01:06:21,830
That's exactly what I said
to his little wife.

907
01:06:21,972 --> 01:06:23,597
I must say, she was astonishing.

908
01:06:23,738 --> 01:06:25,931
Of course, she was very lucky
to have me there with her.

909
01:06:26,072 --> 01:06:27,628
You took the words out of my mouth.

910
01:06:27,772 --> 01:06:29,965
Even so, my dear,
she behaved like a saint.

911
01:06:30,105 --> 01:06:32,969
Sweetness and light.
Sweetness and light.

912
01:06:33,105 --> 01:06:34,365
Patience on a monument.

913
01:06:34,505 --> 01:06:36,733
- Not one single word of reproach.
- Frightening.

914
01:06:36,872 --> 01:06:38,770
And when he came back, all smiles,

915
01:06:38,905 --> 01:06:40,996
as if he'd just got in
from a stroll in the park,

916
01:06:41,139 --> 01:06:44,003
she didn't open her mouth.
They just headed straight for the bedroom.

917
01:06:44,672 --> 01:06:46,968
I can promise you,
for the next hour and a half,

918
01:06:47,105 --> 01:06:50,003
there wasn't a woman in the world
happier than me.

919
01:06:50,405 --> 01:06:52,394
Except possibly Edmée.

920
01:06:54,206 --> 01:06:56,104
Oh, no. Ha-ha-ha.

921
01:06:56,505 --> 01:06:59,835
I don't think Edmée's very keen
on all that. Ha, ha.

922
01:06:59,972 --> 01:07:02,802
Bit of a cold fish, I'd say.
Like her mother.

923
01:07:03,638 --> 01:07:05,070
Is that right?

924
01:07:05,206 --> 01:07:08,569
Anyway, the important thing
is that he's now ready to settle down.

925
01:07:08,705 --> 01:07:09,830
Love his house.

926
01:07:09,972 --> 01:07:13,495
He'll take care of his money
and he'll adore his children.

927
01:07:15,239 --> 01:07:17,932
Well, you don't have to make it sound
quite so depressing.

928
01:07:27,005 --> 01:07:29,630
This cognac is 74 years old.

929
01:07:29,772 --> 01:07:32,034
Oh, must be appallingly expensive.

930
01:07:32,172 --> 01:07:35,934
Lotte, that's sweet of you
to be concerned.

931
01:07:36,072 --> 01:07:40,800
You wouldn't be if you knew how much my
oil stocks had gone up this last quarter.

932
01:07:41,139 --> 01:07:43,071
You never told me you were in oil.

933
01:07:43,206 --> 01:07:46,296
You were wrapped up
in your matrimonial arrangements.

934
01:07:46,438 --> 01:07:49,269
Not too wrapped up
to miss buying into Compressed Fuels.

935
01:07:49,405 --> 01:07:52,303
Well, and you never told me either.

936
01:07:54,471 --> 01:07:57,767
The last thing I wanted was to barge in
on your new love affair.

937
01:07:57,905 --> 01:08:00,496
How is all that, by the way?
Still happy?

938
01:08:00,638 --> 01:08:02,627
- Very.
- Do you have a photo?

939
01:08:02,772 --> 01:08:05,068
Your spies haven't come up
with anything, then?

940
01:08:05,206 --> 01:08:06,933
Oh, what spies?

941
01:08:07,072 --> 01:08:09,129
You know I never listen to gossip.

942
01:08:09,271 --> 01:08:11,067
But Chéri said to me this morning,
just as l...

943
01:08:11,206 --> 01:08:12,263
He knew you were coming?

944
01:08:12,405 --> 01:08:13,598
Of course.

945
01:08:15,572 --> 01:08:16,902
Why should that make you blush?

946
01:08:17,805 --> 01:08:19,828
So you told him I was back?

947
01:08:19,972 --> 01:08:21,165
No.

948
01:08:21,305 --> 01:08:23,169
He told me.

949
01:08:23,305 --> 01:08:24,430
He sent me.

950
01:08:25,172 --> 01:08:28,331
He was so anxious
to have some news of you.

951
01:08:29,305 --> 01:08:31,135
What do you expect?

952
01:08:31,271 --> 01:08:34,260
How could he forget a woman like you?

953
01:08:34,838 --> 01:08:38,463
If you want my opinion,
you've only to lift a finger...

954
01:08:38,605 --> 01:08:40,935
I don't want your opinion.

955
01:08:48,405 --> 01:08:51,997
That woman always makes me feel
so grubby.

956
01:08:52,139 --> 01:08:55,071
I can't stop myself
from going down to her level.

957
01:08:55,206 --> 01:08:56,899
She's always been a troublemaker.

958
01:08:57,039 --> 01:08:59,903
I landed a good few blows today.

959
01:09:00,039 --> 01:09:04,232
We're like two dogs
fighting over an old slipper.

960
01:09:04,605 --> 01:09:06,230
She made me realize something.

961
01:09:06,371 --> 01:09:09,531
When we parted, Chéri and I,

962
01:09:09,672 --> 01:09:15,071
we each lost the only
really honorable thing in our lives.

963
01:09:20,738 --> 01:09:25,761
Beautiful handles, don't you think,
for such an old vase?

964
01:09:25,905 --> 01:09:27,700
Yes, madame.

965
01:09:31,172 --> 01:09:34,968
Maybe I should start a business.
What do you think?

966
01:09:36,538 --> 01:09:38,470
Aline Mesmacker
opened that restaurant.

967
01:09:38,605 --> 01:09:41,298
Apparently, she's making a fortune.

968
01:09:41,638 --> 01:09:43,695
Or I could finance Khun.

969
01:09:43,838 --> 01:09:47,395
I know he wants
to open his own fashion house.

970
01:09:47,538 --> 01:09:53,164
Ugh, what am I talking about?
I've always hated the idea of working.

971
01:09:53,638 --> 01:09:56,433
This was my only place of business.

972
01:09:56,572 --> 01:09:59,936
And the customers have all gone.

973
01:10:08,338 --> 01:10:09,804
It's after midnight.

974
01:10:11,939 --> 01:10:14,030
Go see who it is.

975
01:10:17,072 --> 01:10:18,129
Monsieur Peloux.

976
01:10:18,271 --> 01:10:20,362
There's something
I have to talk to her about.

977
01:10:20,505 --> 01:10:22,630
Madame would be ready
to see you in the morning.

978
01:10:22,772 --> 01:10:25,567
Shan't be more than five minutes.
- Monsieur, please.

979
01:10:26,605 --> 01:10:27,935
Monsieur, no. Please don't go up.

980
01:10:28,072 --> 01:10:30,230
Out of my way, Rose.
- No, monsieur, please.

981
01:10:30,371 --> 01:10:31,564
No. Madame...

982
01:10:31,705 --> 01:10:34,603
No, Madame is not here...
Monsieur, no.

983
01:10:35,005 --> 01:10:36,470
No.

984
01:10:36,905 --> 01:10:38,268
Madame...

985
01:10:38,405 --> 01:10:40,997
I'll deal with this, Rose.

986
01:10:43,738 --> 01:10:46,295
You might, at least, take your hat off.

987
01:10:48,905 --> 01:10:51,666
- May I sit down?
- If you want to.

988
01:10:55,405 --> 01:10:56,735
Do you mind if I smoke?

989
01:10:57,939 --> 01:10:59,996
Do what you like.

990
01:11:02,905 --> 01:11:03,962
Marcel let me in.

991
01:11:04,104 --> 01:11:05,331
Well, why wouldn't he have?

992
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:08,699
You expect me to change my staff
every time you get married?

993
01:11:08,838 --> 01:11:11,998
- No, all I meant was...
- How long were you intending to stay?

994
01:11:12,138 --> 01:11:14,071
Please note I haven't asked you
what you mean

995
01:11:14,205 --> 01:11:16,398
by bursting in on me
in the middle of the night.

996
01:11:16,805 --> 01:11:20,067
- You can ask, if you like.
- No, I'm not interested.

997
01:11:21,538 --> 01:11:24,595
So you don't even want to know
why I'm here?

998
01:11:26,205 --> 01:11:28,228
I've come back.

999
01:11:29,738 --> 01:11:34,295
It never occurred to you that barging
in like this might be embarrassing?

1000
01:11:35,838 --> 01:11:37,599
You understand what I'm saying?

1001
01:11:43,071 --> 01:11:45,594
Your friend's not back yet.
Is that what you mean?

1002
01:11:45,738 --> 01:11:47,226
That's not of your bus...

1003
01:11:47,371 --> 01:11:49,564
Not in there. How many times?

1004
01:11:52,638 --> 01:11:54,433
What's this?

1005
01:11:54,572 --> 01:11:57,333
- An emerald.
- I can see it's an emerald. I'm not blind.

1006
01:11:57,471 --> 01:11:59,937
What I mean is, who gave it to you?

1007
01:12:00,071 --> 01:12:01,128
No one you know.

1008
01:12:01,271 --> 01:12:03,567
It's beautiful, isn't it?

1009
01:12:03,705 --> 01:12:05,830
Everyone admires it. Everywhere I go...

1010
01:12:05,972 --> 01:12:08,028
That's enough.

1011
01:12:11,905 --> 01:12:13,598
- What are you doing?
- Calling the police.

1012
01:12:13,738 --> 01:12:15,636
Don't be ridiculous.

1013
01:12:26,104 --> 01:12:28,003
Nounoune.

1014
01:12:31,238 --> 01:12:33,466
Oh, Nounoune.

1015
01:12:35,205 --> 01:12:36,831
Say you're sorry.

1016
01:12:36,972 --> 01:12:38,631
Why should I?

1017
01:12:38,772 --> 01:12:41,329
It's that or leave the house.

1018
01:12:42,972 --> 01:12:44,665
- Sorry.
- I can't hear you.

1019
01:12:44,805 --> 01:12:46,065
I'm sorry.

1020
01:12:47,438 --> 01:12:49,301
That's better.

1021
01:12:50,038 --> 01:12:52,266
What's the matter?

1022
01:12:53,038 --> 01:12:54,163
What's happened?

1023
01:12:54,305 --> 01:12:57,669
Nothing's happened.
I've come back, that's all.

1024
01:13:00,772 --> 01:13:02,795
Nounoune.

1025
01:13:14,872 --> 01:13:16,633
Shh.

1026
01:13:21,838 --> 01:13:23,565
So, then...

1027
01:13:25,371 --> 01:13:26,996
Do you love me?

1028
01:13:27,138 --> 01:13:28,866
Yes.

1029
01:13:29,738 --> 01:13:31,260
Yes.

1030
01:13:31,405 --> 01:13:32,894
Yes.

1031
01:13:44,138 --> 01:13:46,161
Do you have a lover?

1032
01:13:48,371 --> 01:13:50,530
Do you or do you not have a lover?

1033
01:13:50,672 --> 01:13:52,262
No.

1034
01:13:53,238 --> 01:13:55,534
Except for you.

1035
01:13:56,405 --> 01:13:58,633
I love you.

1036
01:14:31,572 --> 01:14:33,435
You're awake.

1037
01:14:33,572 --> 01:14:35,299
So are you.

1038
01:14:35,805 --> 01:14:38,236
- What time is it?
- What difference does it make?

1039
01:14:38,371 --> 01:14:41,360
I don't know yet.
- You're back.

1040
01:14:44,371 --> 01:14:46,701
Tell me. Ahem.

1041
01:14:47,971 --> 01:14:50,096
Uh, tomorrow...

1042
01:14:50,238 --> 01:14:53,398
Don't worry, I'll take care of everything.

1043
01:14:54,538 --> 01:14:56,197
Mm?

1044
01:14:56,871 --> 01:15:00,031
We'll try to be as discrete as we can,

1045
01:15:00,171 --> 01:15:04,160
causing as little scandal or suffering
as possible.

1046
01:15:04,305 --> 01:15:08,032
We'd better go back down south
for a few months.

1047
01:15:08,171 --> 01:15:12,035
Somewhere peaceful
so we can look at each other.

1048
01:15:13,238 --> 01:15:17,193
You just go back to sleep
and leave it all to me.

1049
01:15:29,938 --> 01:15:31,632
All right.

1050
01:15:32,138 --> 01:15:33,865
Thank you.

1051
01:15:35,338 --> 01:15:37,634
No, that's too late.

1052
01:15:43,038 --> 01:15:45,470
Isn't there something earlier?

1053
01:15:57,138 --> 01:16:00,468
Isn't there one at noon or 12:30?

1054
01:16:02,738 --> 01:16:05,033
No, that's too early.

1055
01:16:15,071 --> 01:16:16,298
All right, then.

1056
01:16:16,438 --> 01:16:19,529
Two for 3:15, first class.

1057
01:16:20,004 --> 01:16:21,493
Thank you.

1058
01:16:41,238 --> 01:16:43,295
- More to eat?
- No, thanks.

1059
01:16:44,305 --> 01:16:45,827
- Not hungry?
- Not really.

1060
01:16:45,971 --> 01:16:47,130
Take your rhubarb pills.

1061
01:16:47,271 --> 01:16:48,464
I wish you wouldn't fuss.

1062
01:16:54,371 --> 01:16:55,428
We need to talk.

1063
01:16:55,572 --> 01:16:58,060
Let's get it over with, shall we?

1064
01:16:58,672 --> 01:17:00,729
You've come back,

1065
01:17:01,071 --> 01:17:03,663
that's the important thing.

1066
01:17:04,605 --> 01:17:07,798
How could I ever have thought
you were just like all the others?

1067
01:17:07,938 --> 01:17:11,302
Why didn't I realize you were the one?

1068
01:17:11,438 --> 01:17:12,801
The only one.

1069
01:17:12,938 --> 01:17:15,836
The love that comes along only once.

1070
01:17:19,771 --> 01:17:22,431
Now, let's be practical.

1071
01:17:22,572 --> 01:17:25,697
Are you willing to leave
all the arrangements to me?

1072
01:17:26,737 --> 01:17:29,965
Oh, how are we going
to let them know?

1073
01:17:30,371 --> 01:17:33,166
A letter is probably the best way.

1074
01:17:33,305 --> 01:17:35,793
Quite short and to the point,
I should think.

1075
01:17:36,572 --> 01:17:37,901
I'll help you write it.

1076
01:17:38,438 --> 01:17:40,461
We need to get some of your things
before we leave.

1077
01:17:40,605 --> 01:17:41,968
I hope your mother will cooperate.

1078
01:17:42,104 --> 01:17:44,070
Will you stop pulling at the skin
on your toe.

1079
01:17:44,771 --> 01:17:47,862
That's the way
to get an ingrown toenail.

1080
01:17:50,605 --> 01:17:53,503
Don't you have anything
to contribute to this discussion?

1081
01:17:53,638 --> 01:17:55,069
You're like a 12-year-old.

1082
01:17:55,205 --> 01:17:58,069
With you, Nounoune, I'm likely to stay
that way for the rest of my life.

1083
01:17:59,438 --> 01:18:01,063
What do you mean?

1084
01:18:01,205 --> 01:18:02,932
What I say.

1085
01:18:03,071 --> 01:18:05,299
It's true, isn't it? You can't deny it.

1086
01:18:06,804 --> 01:18:10,237
Most people would be pleased
to have the secret to eternal youth.

1087
01:18:11,737 --> 01:18:13,431
Its part of your charm, stupid.

1088
01:18:13,572 --> 01:18:15,595
I don't know why you're complaining
to me about it.

1089
01:18:15,737 --> 01:18:16,964
I'm complaining to you about it

1090
01:18:17,104 --> 01:18:19,536
because if I am like a 12-year-old,
it's your fault.

1091
01:18:19,671 --> 01:18:21,535
My fault?

1092
01:18:23,038 --> 01:18:24,265
Oh, my poor Nounoune.

1093
01:18:24,405 --> 01:18:25,598
I can do without your pity.

1094
01:18:25,737 --> 01:18:28,363
What did you mean, my fault?

1095
01:18:28,737 --> 01:18:31,203
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.

1096
01:18:32,271 --> 01:18:35,169
It's just that, for me, you were always...

1097
01:18:35,704 --> 01:18:37,670
I was always?

1098
01:18:40,871 --> 01:18:44,497
You sound as if you're reading the eulogy
at my funeral.

1099
01:18:53,305 --> 01:18:58,431
You think you can go on drifting back
and forth between Edmée and me?

1100
01:18:59,737 --> 01:19:01,294
Is that what you have in mind?

1101
01:19:05,938 --> 01:19:08,336
Well, if it is,

1102
01:19:08,471 --> 01:19:12,426
you'll have to learn to look
a good deal less guilty than that.

1103
01:19:12,971 --> 01:19:16,199
Unless she's a lot stupider
than I take her for.

1104
01:19:16,338 --> 01:19:19,735
Or perhaps you think you can get your
mother to keep her under lock and key

1105
01:19:19,871 --> 01:19:23,633
while you wander around
doing what you feel like.

1106
01:19:24,305 --> 01:19:26,328
She's not gonna put up with it forever,
you know?

1107
01:19:26,471 --> 01:19:28,698
Don't forget,
she's Marie Laure's daughter.

1108
01:19:28,837 --> 01:19:31,360
The poison's bound to come out
somehow or another.

1109
01:19:31,505 --> 01:19:33,061
- She may be a...
- Stop it, Nounoune.

1110
01:19:33,538 --> 01:19:36,003
I can't allow you to ruin my idea of you.

1111
01:19:36,371 --> 01:19:37,496
What?

1112
01:19:37,637 --> 01:19:40,069
Talking like that,
you sound like my mother!

1113
01:19:42,438 --> 01:19:44,301
Before I got married, you said to me:

1114
01:19:44,438 --> 01:19:46,733
"Be kind to her, try not to let her suffer."

1115
01:19:46,871 --> 01:19:49,429
That's what you're like.
You're a good person.

1116
01:19:49,971 --> 01:19:53,664
Even last night you said
you hoped I hadn't done something cruel.

1117
01:19:53,804 --> 01:19:55,895
You're above all that!

1118
01:19:59,371 --> 01:20:01,337
Nounoune.

1119
01:20:02,505 --> 01:20:04,834
That's why I've always loved you.

1120
01:20:06,637 --> 01:20:08,126
Why did you come back?

1121
01:20:12,405 --> 01:20:15,064
- I was just starting...
- Well, I wasn't.

1122
01:20:16,938 --> 01:20:17,995
Neither was I.

1123
01:20:20,871 --> 01:20:23,531
I came back

1124
01:20:24,205 --> 01:20:25,898
because I couldn't go on without you.

1125
01:20:29,271 --> 01:20:33,635
You have no idea what my life's
been like these past few weeks.

1126
01:20:34,737 --> 01:20:38,295
Now I know what it is to suffer
because of a woman.

1127
01:20:40,871 --> 01:20:44,633
When I found out you were back,
I was so relieved.

1128
01:20:44,771 --> 01:20:47,067
I thought I could go home.

1129
01:20:47,205 --> 01:20:49,568
Everything would be all right.

1130
01:20:50,537 --> 01:20:53,470
But all I could think about was...

1131
01:20:54,305 --> 01:20:57,702
And then last night,
I came back here and...

1132
01:20:58,471 --> 01:21:00,334
You came back here and...

1133
01:21:04,971 --> 01:21:07,562
You found an old woman.

1134
01:21:15,771 --> 01:21:19,498
Yes, you found an old woman.

1135
01:21:20,904 --> 01:21:22,699
Don't cry. Why are you crying?

1136
01:21:22,837 --> 01:21:25,894
I'm so grateful to you.

1137
01:21:26,305 --> 01:21:27,793
Were you really in love with me?

1138
01:21:27,938 --> 01:21:31,234
Did you really think
I was such a good person?

1139
01:21:32,837 --> 01:21:35,598
If I had been a truly good person,
I'd have made a man of you

1140
01:21:35,737 --> 01:21:40,669
instead of thinking of nothing
but your pleasure and my happiness.

1141
01:21:41,871 --> 01:21:45,201
I wouldn't have kept you all to myself.

1142
01:21:45,804 --> 01:21:47,929
Look at me.

1143
01:21:52,671 --> 01:21:54,637
You're right.

1144
01:21:55,271 --> 01:21:59,294
The qualities you lack,
I expect it is my fault.

1145
01:21:59,437 --> 01:22:05,268
But 30 years of easy living
does make you very vulnerable.

1146
01:22:06,704 --> 01:22:10,761
So no, I never did talk to you
about the future.

1147
01:22:11,271 --> 01:22:13,169
Forgive me.

1148
01:22:13,737 --> 01:22:17,226
I loved you as if we were going
to die the same day.

1149
01:22:18,938 --> 01:22:22,461
I carried you in my heart
for such a long time.

1150
01:22:23,737 --> 01:22:29,136
I forgot you were going to have
to carry your own burdens.

1151
01:22:30,271 --> 01:22:32,532
A young wife.

1152
01:22:33,338 --> 01:22:35,963
Perhaps even a child.

1153
01:22:38,104 --> 01:22:39,933
And so

1154
01:22:41,338 --> 01:22:43,565
you're going to suffer.

1155
01:22:44,404 --> 01:22:46,734
You're going to miss me.

1156
01:22:47,205 --> 01:22:52,694
And you're going to have
to try to find enough wisdom and tolerance

1157
01:22:52,837 --> 01:22:54,962
not to cause suffering to others.

1158
01:22:59,238 --> 01:23:01,204
The thing is,

1159
01:23:01,971 --> 01:23:05,425
now you've had a taste of youth.

1160
01:23:06,404 --> 01:23:11,462
It's never satisfying,
but you'll always want to go back for more.

1161
01:23:17,271 --> 01:23:19,328
You must go.

1162
01:23:21,470 --> 01:23:22,800
I love you.

1163
01:23:22,938 --> 01:23:25,200
But it's too late.

1164
01:23:28,038 --> 01:23:30,197
So get dressed.

1165
01:23:30,338 --> 01:23:32,565
And go away now.

1166
01:24:22,804 --> 01:24:24,963
<i>Chéri felt capsized,</i>

1167
01:24:25,104 --> 01:24:29,468
<i>as if he'd been present</i>
<i>at some irreversible catastrophe.</i>

1168
01:24:35,871 --> 01:24:39,803
<i>And, indeed, far sooner than he</i>
<i>or anyone else could have predicted,</i>

1169
01:24:39,938 --> 01:24:43,301
<i>the belle époque itself</i>
<i>was swept away utterly by a war</i>

1170
01:24:43,437 --> 01:24:47,733
<i>in which he fought</i>
<i>and from which he returned unharmed.</i>

1171
01:24:55,270 --> 01:24:57,429
He's going to come back.

1172
01:25:07,437 --> 01:25:10,335
<i>At the same time,</i>
<i>he was unable to suppress a sense</i>

1173
01:25:10,470 --> 01:25:14,198
<i>that he had escaped from something,</i>
<i>that he was a free man again,</i>

1174
01:25:14,337 --> 01:25:19,202
<i>a feeling he eventually came</i>
<i>to realize was entirely misguided.</i>

1175
01:25:19,337 --> 01:25:21,599
<i>It was many years</i>
<i>before he understood</i>

1176
01:25:21,737 --> 01:25:24,464
<i>that both of them</i>
<i>had been quite unjustly punished.</i>

1177
01:25:24,604 --> 01:25:27,365
<i>Lea, for having been born</i>
<i>so many years before him.</i>

1178
01:25:27,504 --> 01:25:29,527
<i>And Chéri, for having failed to grasp</i>

1179
01:25:29,671 --> 01:25:34,262
<i>that Lea was the only woman</i>
<i>he would ever be able to love.</i>

1180
01:25:40,704 --> 01:25:43,932

<i>that this was the case,</i>

1181
01:25:44,071 --> 01:25:46,434
<i>he looked out his old service revolver</i>

1182
01:25:46,571 --> 01:25:49,230
<i>and put a bullet in his brain.</i>
