00:01:04,813 --> 00:01:06,773
Shit.

2
00:01:50,066 --> 00:01:52,611
- A little late.
- Yeah, tell me about it.

3
00:01:54,529 --> 00:01:58,366
I'm all out of spares.
Should have been home hours ago.

4
00:02:14,257 --> 00:02:17,260
That's got it.

5
00:02:17,344 --> 00:02:20,597
Thanks.
See you in a half hour.

6
00:02:21,556 --> 00:02:23,683
Open up.

7
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,403
Get me out of this trap!

8
00:02:57,133 --> 00:02:59,928
Hey, Louie!

9
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:16,903
- Give my regards to Broadway.
- What'd I tell you about
screwing around with my books?

10
00:03:17,028 --> 00:03:19,406
I didn't touch your fag rags,
you understand?

11
00:03:19,531 --> 00:03:22,617
Who the hell else touched them then?
There's only you and me in here.

12
00:03:22,742 --> 00:03:26,580
- Piss off!
- Hey, man, don't fuckin'
tell me to piss off.

13
00:03:26,663 --> 00:03:28,790
I just did, asshole.

14
00:03:34,296 --> 00:03:36,173
Come on.
Come on, big cowboy.

15
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,974
- We got a problem in 1 7.
Better get down there.
- Hey, Billy. Billy, get him good.

16
00:03:53,982 --> 00:03:57,235
- Come on!
- Get ya down there!

17
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,780
- Kick the shit out of him!
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

18
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,710
Hey! Hey!
What's going on in there?

19
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:20,842
Kill the mother!

20
00:04:26,097 --> 00:04:27,974
Do it!

21
00:04:31,895 --> 00:04:34,189
Help!

22
00:04:34,314 --> 00:04:36,191
Oh, God!

23
00:04:36,316 --> 00:04:38,860
Get off!

24
00:04:38,944 --> 00:04:41,863
Die, you fucker!
You son of a bitch!

25
00:04:41,947 --> 00:04:46,660
I'm coming after you!
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

26
00:04:46,743 --> 00:04:48,453
You goddam scum!
I'll kill you!

27
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:56,711
God!

28
00:04:56,837 --> 00:04:59,589
Will you take it easy?

29
00:05:02,217 --> 00:05:04,177
Put him up here.

30
00:05:04,302 --> 00:05:07,222
Numbnuts!

31
00:05:07,305 --> 00:05:10,183
Fuck you.

32
00:05:12,477 --> 00:05:14,771
Don't move.

33
00:05:14,896 --> 00:05:18,149
Doc, keep your shoes
in one place, man.

34
00:05:21,736 --> 00:05:24,573
Fuck you too.

35
00:05:25,657 --> 00:05:28,493
Come on.
Get on the table.

36
00:05:28,577 --> 00:05:32,581
Hey. Hey!
Stick, we gotta go!

37
00:05:32,664 --> 00:05:35,208
I want to ask you a question.
Do you think it's humane...

38
00:05:35,292 --> 00:05:39,462
to pump perfectly sane prisoners
full of fiiloxin and thorazine?

39
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,967
Come on, man.
Let's get out of here.

40
00:05:46,511 --> 00:05:48,722
All right,
we got three minutes.

41
00:06:35,268 --> 00:06:37,145
Let go.
Let go, man.

42
00:06:46,696 --> 00:06:49,699
Get in the box.
Get in the box!

43
00:08:16,536 --> 00:08:19,206
- Okay. See you next week.
- Right.

44
00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:22,000
- Good night.
- Good night. Thanks.

45
00:08:49,402 --> 00:08:51,696
Are we out?

46
00:08:52,864 --> 00:08:54,658
- We out?
- Yeah.

47
00:08:58,662 --> 00:09:00,622
Yeah?

48
00:09:07,796 --> 00:09:12,092
- Who's this?
- Uh, that's, uh, Maria McGuire.

49
00:09:12,217 --> 00:09:14,344
She came a couple of times
to visit Montgomery.

50
00:09:14,427 --> 00:09:17,931
222 1 Speck Road, Seattle.
Is that address current?

51
00:09:18,014 --> 00:09:19,891
I hope so.
That's all we got.

52
00:09:19,975 --> 00:09:23,061
May I, uh--
Thank you.

53
00:09:24,563 --> 00:09:30,068
Hey, you want these eggs hot?
You want me freeze them?
Come on. Pick them up. Thank you.

54
00:09:30,151 --> 00:09:33,029
- See the game last night?
- No, no. I missed it.

55
00:09:33,113 --> 00:09:36,533
Whoa. Don't get your hands
too close to his mouth.

56
00:09:36,616 --> 00:09:38,827
Anything else?

57
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:42,497
- Yeah, I'd like another
cup of coffee, please.
- Okay.

58
00:09:42,622 --> 00:09:46,293
- And I'd like a side order of sausage.
- You bet.

59
00:09:46,418 --> 00:09:49,171
- How long has he been in there?
- About ten minutes.

60
00:09:59,681 --> 00:10:03,101
- That is disgusting.
- Really?

61
00:10:05,145 --> 00:10:07,606
My God. Do you eat like that
in front of your mother?

62
00:10:07,731 --> 00:10:10,817
- It's an old family custom.
- Well, I'll tell ya, it's not healthy.

63
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:14,654
You gotta take your time.
Do you have any idea what that
does to your digestive system?

64
00:10:14,738 --> 00:10:17,032
No, but I'm afraid
you're gonna tell me.

65
00:10:17,115 --> 00:10:19,951
You've got to savour
the qualities of the cuisine.

66
00:10:20,035 --> 00:10:22,954
First the smell--
Oh, for Christ's sake--

67
00:10:23,038 --> 00:10:25,665
There he is. Come on. Let's go.
Pay the cheque.

68
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:32,005
Come on. Let's get the forklift up here.
Come on. Let's go.

69
00:10:37,302 --> 00:10:39,679
There he is.

70
00:10:57,405 --> 00:10:59,699
All right, he's not here.
You check upstairs. I'll take the docks.

71
00:10:59,783 --> 00:11:04,496
Oh, no, no. I picked up the cheque.
You take the fiish.

72
00:11:05,664 --> 00:11:08,375
Oh, shit.

73
00:11:57,841 --> 00:12:02,470
You're under arrest!
You have the right to remain silent.

74
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:05,557
Oh, shit!

75
00:12:46,598 --> 00:12:49,351
Oh, shit!

76
00:12:51,019 --> 00:12:54,356
Bill!

77
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:01,821
Bill!

78
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,992
Stop! Police!

79
00:13:09,037 --> 00:13:11,164
Bill!

80
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:24,177
Pardon me. Excuse me.
Sorry. My fault.

81
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:28,014
Sorry. Oh, God.

82
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:49,369
What do you think you're doin'?

83
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:57,502
- Hey!
- Freeze!

84
00:13:57,627 --> 00:14:02,090
Lace your fiingers above your head
and turn around towards me real slow.

85
00:14:02,215 --> 00:14:04,885
Now you're under arrest.

86
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:08,763
Get back!

87
00:14:24,487 --> 00:14:27,324
Chris!

88
00:14:27,407 --> 00:14:30,285
Oh, God, I hate this part.

89
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:44,591
I'm on fire

90
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,181
Desire

91
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:06,112
- Took you long enough.
- It's my one desire

92
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:10,242
- Desire to win
- Free air, man. Free air.

93
00:15:10,325 --> 00:15:13,078
- I'm gonna say it again, say it again
- You don't know what this means.
- It's my one

94
00:15:13,161 --> 00:15:16,748
- You have no idea.
- Yeah. Let's move.
- Desire

95
00:15:39,437 --> 00:15:41,398
Hi, Bernie.
I'd like some prints.

96
00:15:41,481 --> 00:15:44,734
And there's some blood on the blade.
I'd like to have it typed.
Thank you very much.

97
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:48,405
What is that smell?
Chris?

98
00:15:48,488 --> 00:15:51,992
Oh, oh, oh, oh, looks like somebody's
been in a fiight,Jack.

99
00:15:52,075 --> 00:15:55,745
What? Nobody in cuffs here?
That must mean something.

100
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:58,665
No, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait
a minute. I think that means that, uh...

101
00:15:58,748 --> 00:16:00,709
somebody got their ass kicked.

102
00:16:00,792 --> 00:16:04,462
Complaints.
I'm Bernie.

103
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:08,216
- Okay.
- God, you stink.

104
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:13,013
Hey, guys. Captain wants to
see you in his offiice ASAP.

105
00:16:13,096 --> 00:16:17,017
ASAP? I'd like to take a shower fiirst.
What do you say?

106
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,935
- Please.
- I wish you would.

107
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:22,772
But by the sound of his voice,
I think he'll see you as is.

108
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:25,233
Go ahead! Get out!

109
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,277
Uh, wait a minute, chuckles.

110
00:16:27,402 --> 00:16:32,616
- Captain wants to see you too.
- What'd you do now?

111
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:38,371
What the hell happened to you?
Looks like you got your ass kicked?

112
00:16:38,496 --> 00:16:42,334
No, no, don't sit there, no.
Shut the door.

113
00:16:42,417 --> 00:16:46,463
Gentlemen, this is Agent Thomas Lusk
from the regional FBI headquarters.

114
00:16:46,546 --> 00:16:48,507
- Detective Bill Reimers.
- Hey, Billy.

115
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:53,929
- There's, uh, Chris Lecce over there.
Uh, Phil Coldshank.
- Pleasure, sir.

116
00:16:54,012 --> 00:16:56,681
- And, uh,Jack Pismo.
- Right on.

117
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:59,518
''Right on.''
He said, ''Right on.''

118
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:02,687
Now, the FBI has requested some help
over the next couple of weeks.

119
00:17:02,812 --> 00:17:05,190
So for now,
your cases have been reassigned.

120
00:17:05,273 --> 00:17:09,653
- Whoa, whoa, reassigned?
- Wait a minute. Bill and I are close
to breaking this thing--
- A forklift, wasn't it?

121
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,907
From now on,
you're working full-time on this.

122
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:16,910
- Kleenex, please.
- In the drawer there.

123
00:17:16,993 --> 00:17:21,289
Mr, uh, Lusk
is in charge of this operation,
so I'll let him do the talking.

124
00:17:21,414 --> 00:17:25,961
Yeah, I-I don't know if
you're familiar with Montgomery,
but, uh, just in case you're not.

125
00:17:26,044 --> 00:17:28,338
Two years ago he killed
one of our agents.

126
00:17:28,463 --> 00:17:30,590
He should have had the chair,
but he had a sharp attorney...

127
00:17:30,715 --> 00:17:34,302
and the local police were a little too
zealous in their pursuit of evidence.

128
00:17:34,427 --> 00:17:37,681
- A plea bargain kept him from frying.
- Yo!
- Sorry.

129
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:40,892
Just busted out of Stonehurst,
didn't he? Killed a guard?

130
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:45,772
Yeah, he and his cousin
crossed into Wyoming, ditched
their truck and had a car waiting.

131
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:50,151
- If he's in Wyoming, why are you here?
- Well, we think he'll head for Mexico,
but he has friends here.

132
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:52,821
So we're setting up
a half a dozen stake-outs.

133
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:56,992
Now, uh, we'll handle
the important ones, but, uh,
since we're a little short on help...

134
00:17:57,075 --> 00:17:59,035
uh, your men will take the others.

135
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,621
- Of course.
- Who we watching?

136
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:04,666
Oh, he has an old girlfriend here. He
hasn't seen her for a year and a half.

137
00:18:04,749 --> 00:18:09,379
Her name is Maria McGuire.
Now, you'll be watching her house...

138
00:18:09,462 --> 00:18:13,133
and the Second Precinct will take her
at the restaurant where she works.

139
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:16,845
Here are the keys
to the apartment we rented across
the street from where she lives.

140
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,514
Now, we're gonna have
to move on this one quick.

141
00:18:19,639 --> 00:18:25,061
I-- I know it's short notice,
but this is real bad people we're after.

142
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:29,691
- Do we, uh, get a bug?
- Hopefully within 24 hours.

143
00:18:29,816 --> 00:18:32,569
Uh, just one other thing.

144
00:18:32,652 --> 00:18:36,239
If you spot Montgomery, report it.
Nothing more.

145
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:39,201
Remember,
this is an FBI operation.

146
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,411
Wait a second.
Wait a second.

147
00:18:41,536 --> 00:18:45,457
Excuse me, Captain.
There's something a little ripe here.
Let me-- Let me ask you a question.

148
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:48,335
What you're asking is that
you'd like us to sit on our butts...

149
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:51,505
on some low-priority shit detail...

150
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:55,425
on the off chance that we're gonna run
across some ''bad people.''

151
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:58,929
And then what are we supposed to do?
We're supposed to give you a jingle...

152
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:01,765
so that you can make the arrest
and get the keys to the city?

153
00:19:01,848 --> 00:19:06,228
Excuse me, Captain. I'm sorry.
I don't like to sound negative,
but this is bullshit.

154
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,564
I'm a cop.
You understand me?

155
00:19:09,689 --> 00:19:12,651
I'm not a security guard.

156
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:15,737
I see some ''bad people''...

157
00:19:15,862 --> 00:19:19,616
I'm gonna be a little too busy
to, uh, make a phone call.

158
00:19:19,699 --> 00:19:22,619
Hope the attitude
doesn't affect the performance.

159
00:19:22,702 --> 00:19:25,163
- Would you like to see
how this attitude--
- Are you through, Mr Lecce?

160
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,000
We'll call.

161
00:19:36,591 --> 00:19:38,802
- What an asshole.
- Defiinitely.

162
00:19:38,885 --> 00:19:42,389
Hey! Hey! I don't want to hear
that kind of crap.

163
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:45,016
And I don't want to hear that
someone else heard it either, got it?

164
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:49,187
Now, this is a 24-hour surveillance.
Jack and Phil will take the day shift.

165
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:54,234
- Chris and Bill the nights.
Same routine as last time.
- Aw,Jesus.

166
00:19:54,317 --> 00:19:58,363
- Something bothering you, Mr Coldshank?
- No, no.

167
00:19:58,446 --> 00:20:02,909
Don't bullshit me.
What's on your so-called mind?

168
00:20:03,034 --> 00:20:07,664
Well, if it's all the same to you, sir,
uh, I'd just as soon not be on
a stake-out with them again.

169
00:20:07,747 --> 00:20:09,958
- Hear, hear, sir.
- Why?

170
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:13,503
- Why?
- Yeah. Why?

171
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:18,884
- Chris and Bill are slobs, sir.
No, no. No, no, no.
- The worst. The worst.

172
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:22,470
The last stake-out that Jack and I
were on with them, they never once
cleaned up after themselves.

173
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:25,307
- I mean, look at them. Smell them.
- Lick my left one, buddy.

174
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,350
- You left cigar butts
all over the place.
- Oh, please.

175
00:20:27,475 --> 00:20:31,563
- You guys never once changed the toilet
paper. What, you don't wipe yourself?
- You are disgusting.

176
00:20:31,646 --> 00:20:34,107
- You are fiilth.
- Hey, what about his dog?

177
00:20:34,232 --> 00:20:37,569
- He let his dog
piss all over the carpet.
- Hey, that's a goddam lie!

178
00:20:37,652 --> 00:20:41,072
Come on, come on, come on, come on!
Don't blame it on the dog.
Phil did all the pissing.

179
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:44,659
- How'd you like me to piss on you?
- Sit down!
- You see this?
- Sit down!

180
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:47,370
- Think I broke my zipper.
- That's enough.

181
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:51,541
Now, this is not an invitation
to a prom, boys.

182
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:54,336
I don't give a shit
if you don't like the date.

183
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:58,089
Now, you gentlemen are going to
watch this broad until the fat lady
sings or I say different.

184
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:01,843
And if you fuck this up,
I'm gonna take your nuts...

185
00:21:01,968 --> 00:21:05,722
and tie 'em in a knot
and run 'em through my shredder.

186
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:07,724
- Captain?
- Yeah?

187
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:11,353
- Phil doesn't have any nuts, sir.
- Get out. Get out. Get out.

188
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:13,772
Downwind, please. Please.

189
00:21:24,407 --> 00:21:27,911
All right, that's hers.

190
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:31,456
And we're there.

191
00:21:34,417 --> 00:21:36,378
Home, sweet home.

192
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:45,178
I don't know. I just hope
the place has got some heat.

193
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:48,598
- Carol's okay with all this, isn't she?
- Yeah.

194
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:53,395
Bonnie's gonna kill me if
she ever fiinds out we're gonna
be here for a couple of weeks.

195
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:57,399
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's off to work we go

196
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:02,153
Oh, God.

197
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:13,331
Lucy!
You got some explaining to do.

198
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:19,045
Very attractive. Yeah.
I think Jason lives here.

199
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:30,223
- What a nightmare.
- Really.

200
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:33,560
What the hell did we do
to deserve this?

201
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:36,479
I think it was that stripper
we sent to the captain on his birthday.

202
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:39,274
I told you we should have
sent the woman.

203
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:42,235
Yeah, I think you're right.
I screwed up.

204
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:49,826
- Hello?
- Hello, baby.

205
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:53,121
- Hi. Where are you?
- Well, right now,
I am freezing my butt off...

206
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:56,208
staring through a telescope
at a house on Speck Road.

207
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,460
Didn't anyone ever tell you
that's against the law?

208
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:00,545
- Yeah, right.
- No personal calls, no personal calls.

209
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:02,797
Chris and I got a stake-out,
the night shift.

210
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:06,510
That does it. I'm crossing
the captain off the Christmas list.

211
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:09,638
Yeah.

212
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:12,724
- Uh, Chris says hi.
- That's nice.

213
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:15,685
- So how long is this one
supposed to take?
- Couple of weeks.

214
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:19,439
A couple of weeks? Jeffrey will be
full grown next time you see him.

215
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,608
Yeah, I know.
I hope he remembers me.

216
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:24,319
All right, listen, I gotta go, okay?
All right, I love you.

217
00:23:24,402 --> 00:23:27,072
- I love you too.
- Be good. Bye.

218
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:29,282
Bye-bye.

219
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:32,244
Pizza.

220
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:34,871
I think we're in luck.

221
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:37,624
We got every room covered,
except the bathroom.

222
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:42,170
- Hey, you know,
maybe you should call Bonnie.
- She'll only yell. I'm not in the mood.

223
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:46,800
- Well, I can call her.
You want me to call?
- No, no, no. That's okay.
I-I can call her.

224
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:50,762
I can take care of my own love life,
thank you very much. Get away. Get away.

225
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:53,515
She's probably in bed
with some other guy.

226
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,642
- Poor bastard.
- Poor bastard.

227
00:23:57,811 --> 00:24:02,107
- So, who we watching anyway?
- Uh, Miss Maria Guadalupe--

228
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,901
- Guadalupe.
- McGuire.

229
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:09,072
Irish-Mexican. A waitress going to night
school, but apparently not this quarter.

230
00:24:09,155 --> 00:24:13,201
She drives a 1 980 Volkswagen.
Lives alone.

231
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:17,205
- Nothing.
- Long, brown hair. Brown eyes.

232
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:20,792
- Five-foot-six. Too tall.
- Too tall. For us anyway.

233
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:23,837
Oh, and the moment
we've all been waiting for--

234
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,591
31 3 pounds.

235
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,843
31 3 pounds?
Let me see that.

236
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:32,888
- I would imagine that's fully clothed.
- Oh, my God!

237
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:37,517
Oh, she could be the house.
This is disgusting.

238
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,352
I hate this job.

239
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:48,653
- ''They're dustin' off
the hot seat for me.''
- On the Waterfront.

240
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:52,240
- Who said it?
- Um, Lee J. Cobb.

241
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:56,286
All right, uh, 1 6th president
of the United States?

242
00:24:56,369 --> 00:25:00,540
- Uh, I don't know.
- I'll give you a hint.

243
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:02,751
- Abe Lincoln.
- Right, right.

244
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:05,962
Okay, okay, what movie?
What movie? Um--

245
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:08,590
''Well, this was not
a boating accident.''

246
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:10,759
- I don't know.
- Oh, you're hopeless.

247
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:15,639
- Fifteenth president
of the United States?
- Um, I don't know. Fillmore?

248
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:17,766
Buchanan.
Give me another one.

249
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:20,519
- 1 980 Volkswagen, right?
- Right.

250
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:26,066
The rock's in the sock.
We got some movement, buddy.

251
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:33,823
This is Guadalupe?

252
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,081
Turn around.

253
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,670
I think she's gone on a diet.

254
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:51,216
- Are you gonna shoot pictures
or draw some from memory?
- Right, right, right,
right, right, right.

255
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:55,595
Excuse me. Pardon me. Excuse me.
Pardon me, pardon me. Excuse me.
My fault. There you go. There you go.

256
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,433
God, she's cute.

257
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:08,316
- It's 2:30.
- Better make some notes.

258
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:17,200
She's, uh, walking into the kitchen.

259
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:23,456
- Now she's walking across the room.
- Where's she goin'?

260
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,834
Looks to be the bedroom.

261
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:33,175
- What's she doin'?
- Uh, looks like, uh--

262
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,635
Like what?

263
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,680
Like she's undressing.

264
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:45,061
My God!

265
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:51,443
Oh, wow. Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

266
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:54,946
- No, no, no.
No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No!
- No! No! No! No! No!

267
00:26:56,698 --> 00:27:02,245
- ''To protect and to serve.''
- Oh, oh, oh, I love my job so much.

268
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:31,024
Jack,Jack.
Winston, take a break.

269
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:36,404
- Good dog. You like that?
- What? You teach him that?

270
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:38,823
- That's good. That's good.
- Yesterday. Yesterday. Yeah.

271
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:51,711
Oh, sh--
Will you stop that?

272
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:55,298
Such a kid sometimes.

273
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:58,552
Oh, yeah. Finally.

274
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:03,807
She came in at 2:30 in the morning.
She hasn't been up since. Goodbye.

275
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:06,893
Just replace what you steal,
all right?

276
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:11,022
What a dump.

277
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:14,401
- Looks like your place, huh, Phil?
- Funny.

278
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:17,904
- Watch Winston, will ya?
I'm gonna go take a break.
- All right.

279
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:32,252
- It's started.
- Cute.

280
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:35,338
Very cute! Amateurs.

281
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,579
Are you kidding me?

282
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,737
Are you kidding me?

283
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:15,146
- Yeah?
- So, the answer to the quiz...

284
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:18,733
why didn't Bonnie answer the phone
is that she's moved out.

285
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,448
Do you know what time it is?

286
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:28,118
Yeah, I know what time it is. What do
you want to do, go back to sleep?

287
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:33,039
I already tried that.
It's too goddam light.

288
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:36,001
Well, then pull the shades.

289
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:39,337
I can't.
She took 'em.

290
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:44,426
She took the shades?

291
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:48,722
She paid for 'em.

292
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:51,474
Sorry I didn't get the phone.

293
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:54,352
All right, what do you want me to do?
Let you go back to sleep?

294
00:30:54,436 --> 00:30:57,522
Um, no, no.

295
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:04,571
Look, there's nothing you can
do about it right now anyway.

296
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:12,579
- Did you crack the seal yet?
- Nope.

297
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:16,082
- Well, then, put it back.
- Okay, Dad.

298
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:22,088
Oh, oh, good news.
We, uh-- We get the phone bug tonight.

299
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:25,884
Yippee.
Kiss Carol for me.

300
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:32,349
Lower. Goodbye.

301
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:34,976
- How's Chris?
- Okay.

302
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:38,021
- And how are you?
- I'm tired.

303
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:41,691
- Tired?
- Hmm. Not that tired.

304
00:31:57,207 --> 00:32:00,794
I was lookin'over your shoulder

305
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:05,674
You were next to me, oh

306
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:09,219
You ever think about
what happens after you die?

307
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:12,264
After I die? Yeah.

308
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:16,726
You know what's gonna happen?
I'm gonna be reincarnated...

309
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:19,563
as a judge.

310
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:22,732
All right, forget it.
Bad topic.

311
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:26,695
So, I want to get paid, right?
Figure she still has your money?

312
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:30,490
- Oh, I know she's still got my money.
- How do you know? You haven't seen her
in a year and a half.

313
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:34,035
Because she doesn't even know
she's got it.

314
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,288
Look, no one knows you more than me

315
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,233
...over to Peter's. I'm sure he'll
have some money for bail or something.

316
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:08,195
I-I'm gonna come over to your house now,
okay? I fjust-- No, Mom.

317
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:11,865
Mom, I'm hanging up right now,
all right? Goodbye.

318
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:20,207
We were born to love

319
00:33:22,209 --> 00:33:24,753
- Operator.
- Operator. Yeah.
Can you give me, uh, Seattle--

320
00:33:24,878 --> 00:33:28,048
I mean, um, area code 206?

321
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,719
- Yeah, what?
- Don't you ever say hello?

322
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:35,263
- You ready?
- I'm ready when you are, C.B.

323
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:37,641
Okay, let her answer
before you cut 'em.

324
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:52,572
I-- I don't know.

325
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:56,952
- What did you do?
- Yeah? What is it?

326
00:33:57,035 --> 00:34:00,622
- Como esta, Maria?
- Hello?

327
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:03,917
- Now you're a stranger to me
- Guess who this is.

328
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:09,130
Hello? Hello? Hello?

329
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:11,174
Hello?

330
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:32,362
Hi. I'm sorry to disturb you.
I'm from the phone company.

331
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:34,489
Apparently there's a line problem
in the neighbourhood.

332
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:36,867
- Seriously?
- Yeah. Isn't there something wrong
with your phone?

333
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:40,829
Yeah, my phone's dead. I just
can't believe you're already here.

334
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:46,501
Oh, well, we got a lot of calls,
you know. Whole neighbourhood's down.

335
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:51,631
Well, um, you know, it's really
not a very good time for me right now.
I have to be going.

336
00:34:51,715 --> 00:34:54,259
I understand, I understand. I-It would
only take a couple of minutes.

337
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:58,180
- But if it would be a lot easier,
I guess we could come back next week.
- Uh, wait a minute.

338
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:04,186
I'll bet if I don't have it
fiixed now, it'll be another
couple of weeks or something?

339
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:08,398
- No! No, no. Five days max.
- Five days?

340
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:11,651
Come on, Maria.
How can you resist him?

341
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:15,864
- Okay, if it doesn't take too long,
come on in.
- All right. Be out of your way
in just a second.

342
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:18,825
- Bingo.
- There we go.

343
00:35:18,909 --> 00:35:21,578
Not bad for an old fart.

344
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:27,167
- There's one phone over there
and another in the bedroom.
- Okey-dokey.

345
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:30,170
- Be out of your way as fast as I can.
- Okay.

346
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:51,399
Hi, sailor.

347
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:58,156
She's in the bedroom tidying up,
trying to make a good impression.

348
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:03,954
Oops, don't look under the bed.

349
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:06,873
Okay, okay,
now she's comin'back.

350
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:12,504
Okay, all checked out here.

351
00:36:12,629 --> 00:36:14,840
- Want to show me the next one?
- Sure.

352
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:32,440
Hi. And now a word
from our sponsors.

353
00:36:32,566 --> 00:36:35,277
She's, uh, in the kitchen,
just in case you were wondering.

354
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:50,417
What's that?

355
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:57,924
Now is no time to be pausing
for the news, Chris.

356
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:04,472
W-What are you doin'?
Where you goin'?

357
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:09,519
Chris, she is in the house.
Stop screwing around, for Christ's sake.

358
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:12,647
If you blow this
and we get busted--

359
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:17,444
God damn it, Chris. Come on.
Stop messing around.

360
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:21,323
Chris, she--
She's right there, for Christ's sake.

361
00:37:21,448 --> 00:37:24,242
Chris. Chris, she's comin'.
Chris, she's comin'. She's comin'!

362
00:37:24,326 --> 00:37:28,163
Chris, God damn it!
Jesus Christ!

363
00:37:28,288 --> 00:37:31,374
Look, I really can't wait any more.
Uh, I'm sorry.

364
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:35,837
- Problem?
- Uh, my--

365
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:39,883
My brother is in a lot
of trouble right now. He's down
with the police at the station.

366
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:42,886
And there's bail
I have to take care of and I--

367
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:45,764
- Something serious?
- Yeah, I think it is.

368
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:47,807
Could you come back
tomorrow maybe or--

369
00:37:47,933 --> 00:37:50,685
- I'm done.
- It's fiixed?

370
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:53,063
Well, the problem isn't in the phone.
I think it's out on the pole.

371
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:57,192
- I'm gonna have to check outside.
- Oh.

372
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:01,947
Well, thanks a lot.

373
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:07,369
I'm in love, Bill.

374
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:11,581
I'm leaving you.
It happens to one out of every six men.

375
00:38:11,665 --> 00:38:14,918
I have to face up
to my heterosexuality.

376
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:18,088
But don't worry.
You'll be well provided for.

377
00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:20,215
What the hell were you doin'?

378
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,884
What do you mean,
what was I doin'? I was putting
in a bug, for crying out loud.

379
00:38:22,968 --> 00:38:27,764
Oh, really? Is that what that was? Huh?
Well, I don't call goin' through that
woman's drawers puttin' in a goddam bug.

380
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:32,519
Oh, calm down.
Don't blow a bowel, okay?

381
00:38:32,602 --> 00:38:35,689
For crying out loud.
I thought I saw something...

382
00:38:35,772 --> 00:38:39,526
in her bureau that would tell us whether
or not she talked to Montgomery.

383
00:38:42,612 --> 00:38:45,532
Yeah, she's gone.

384
00:38:45,615 --> 00:38:49,536
Give me the flashlight. I'm gonna
go back in there and check it out.

385
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:53,957
- Come on.
- No, no, no, no, no.

386
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:56,751
- No?
- No! Chris, this is the feds' party.

387
00:38:56,835 --> 00:39:00,672
I am not gonna get my ass canned
for illegal procedure.

388
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:05,719
''This is the feds' party.
I'm not gonna get my ass canned
for illegal procedure.''

389
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:09,598
Give me the goddam flashlight!
And nothing's gonna happen to you.

390
00:39:09,723 --> 00:39:13,226
The worst thing that they could
do to you is that they could
suspend you for, what, three years?

391
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,603
Oh, that's great.

392
00:39:15,437 --> 00:39:19,441
I'm kidding!Jesus, man,
nobody knows when I'm kidding.

393
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:22,068
I'm only making a little joke,
a little humour.

394
00:39:22,152 --> 00:39:24,029
What a boner.

395
00:39:35,332 --> 00:39:38,001
- You there?
- You in?

396
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:41,546
- I'm in.
- Then hurry up.

397
00:39:56,353 --> 00:39:59,689
Car!

398
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:06,404
- I'm sorry. Sorry.
- Are you kidding me?

399
00:40:06,488 --> 00:40:09,115
You're sorry?
You're making me very nervous.

400
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:11,868
Oh, I'm making you nervous?
That's a hoot.

401
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:26,383
Okay, I think I got something
real important here.

402
00:40:27,634 --> 00:40:29,678
A bunch of letters here
all from Montgomery...

403
00:40:29,803 --> 00:40:34,349
and, uh, the last one dated
about four months ago.

404
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:38,270
''Dear Maria--
First you stop coming to visit me...

405
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:41,064
and now you won't
even answer my letters.

406
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:45,443
I understand you're lonely.
I hear you're seeing a couple of guys.

407
00:40:45,527 --> 00:40:50,490
Sometimes I get so mad that I could
wipe out a whole planet...

408
00:40:50,574 --> 00:40:53,076
and enjoy myself doing it.''

409
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:56,037
Now, how could she have dumped
a charmer like him?

410
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:03,003
All right, take this down.
I think we got something to check out.

411
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:05,589
He-- He apparently has a buddy...

412
00:41:05,714 --> 00:41:09,759
with the initials ''B.C. ''
right here in Seattle.

413
00:41:09,843 --> 00:41:12,053
Seems to work on the docks.

414
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:17,142
Uh, now he's talking to her
about some furniture...

415
00:41:17,267 --> 00:41:19,978
he bought her for a present.

416
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:22,189
Does she still have it?

417
00:41:22,314 --> 00:41:26,693
Apparently he got it for her birthday.
It's very important to him.

418
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:34,367
- Holy shit!
- What?

419
00:41:34,451 --> 00:41:37,537
Get out of the house.
Get out of the fucking house, man.

420
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:39,623
She's right there.
She's at the stairs!

421
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:46,588
- Are you fucking with me?
- No, I'm not fucking with you.
Get out of the house!

422
00:42:07,192 --> 00:42:08,735
Come on, Chris.

423
00:43:03,415 --> 00:43:05,542
What are you, crazy?

424
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:07,669
At night

425
00:43:07,794 --> 00:43:11,381
When you turn off all the lights

426
00:43:11,464 --> 00:43:15,218
There's no place that you can hide

427
00:43:15,302 --> 00:43:18,972
No, no
The rhythm is gonna get you

428
00:43:21,391 --> 00:43:24,477
Rhythm is gonna get you
Rhythm is gonna get you

429
00:43:24,603 --> 00:43:28,982
- What is going on in there?
- Rhythm is gonna get you

430
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:31,776
- Where the hell are you?
- Rhythm is gonna get you

431
00:43:32,903 --> 00:43:34,779
Tonight

432
00:43:44,831 --> 00:43:46,875
Rhythm is gonna get you

433
00:43:50,003 --> 00:43:52,380
Tonight

434
00:43:54,257 --> 00:43:55,717
Jesus!

435
00:44:15,946 --> 00:44:19,699
Sergeant Bernie?
Yeah, this is Chris Lecce.

436
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:22,369
I'm fiine. Fine. How are you?

437
00:44:22,452 --> 00:44:27,165
Great. I want you to run a make
on a guy named Reynaldo McGuire.

438
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:30,544
Yeah, fiind out any priors,
anything at all.

439
00:44:30,669 --> 00:44:32,295
Thanks.

440
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:35,173
Oh, just enjoying my day off.

441
00:44:35,298 --> 00:44:37,259
Bye.

442
00:44:40,136 --> 00:44:42,097
Oh, come on.
There is no way, Chris.

443
00:44:42,222 --> 00:44:45,392
- There is no way that one bullet
could have done all that damage
and ended up intact.
- No way? No way?

444
00:44:45,517 --> 00:44:50,397
- What does ''no way'' mean?
- One bullet came from the grassy knoll,
the other from the Texas Schoolbook
Depository. How naive can you be?

445
00:44:50,522 --> 00:44:53,775
Oh, so you think that
the chief justice of the United States
lied, is that right?

446
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:57,070
That Gerald Ford and all
those other people lied?

447
00:44:57,195 --> 00:44:59,239
- Those bastards.
- What?

448
00:44:59,322 --> 00:45:03,368
Well, they ate everything
and left us a goddam dog turd.

449
00:45:03,451 --> 00:45:06,621
- Earl Warren left us a dog turd?
- No, Phil and Jack.

450
00:45:06,705 --> 00:45:09,875
Why do you care about all this stuff?
You were fiive years old
when it happened.

451
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,752
- Who gives a shit?
- I'm gonna get those guys, man. I don't
know how yet, but I'm gonna get them.

452
00:45:12,836 --> 00:45:15,589
Give me the keys to the car.
I'm gonna go to the supermarket.
What do you want?

453
00:45:15,672 --> 00:45:18,758
- How about some truth and justice?
- What else?

454
00:45:18,842 --> 00:45:23,138
- Doughnuts.
- Why not? We're cops.

455
00:45:45,744 --> 00:45:47,621
- Hi.
- Hi.
- The phone man, right?

456
00:45:47,746 --> 00:45:52,375
- Right, right. How's your phone?
- Still works.
You live in the neighbourhood?

457
00:45:52,501 --> 00:45:56,546
- No, no, I was in the area working.
- More lines down?

458
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:58,423
Always.

459
00:45:59,966 --> 00:46:03,470
So you, uh-- you satisfiied
with the phone system, are you?
You don't need anything else installed?

460
00:46:03,595 --> 00:46:06,765
Any trimline or videophone
or anything at all?

461
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:09,726
- You really are a phone man,
aren't you?
- Why do you say that?

462
00:46:09,809 --> 00:46:12,896
You're still working on another line.
Get it?

463
00:46:12,979 --> 00:46:15,357
- Got it.
- Good.
- Sixteen thirteen.

464
00:46:19,319 --> 00:46:23,698
- Hope your phone breaks real soon.
- Promise you'll fiix it if it does?

465
00:46:23,782 --> 00:46:26,701
I promise.

466
00:46:26,785 --> 00:46:28,662
Bye.

467
00:46:30,247 --> 00:46:33,416
Eating in between meals?

468
00:46:33,542 --> 00:46:36,795
''Eating in between meals?''

469
00:46:54,729 --> 00:46:57,357
Wait a minute. Don't go!

470
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,151
Oh, shit.

471
00:47:00,235 --> 00:47:02,445
You wouldn't be headed
in my direction, would you?

472
00:47:02,571 --> 00:47:05,407
I'm sorry, I don't know your name.

473
00:47:07,826 --> 00:47:11,663
- Uh, uh, uh, uh, Bill.
- Bill.
- Bill.
- Bill.

474
00:47:11,746 --> 00:47:13,790
- I'm Maria.
- Hi.

475
00:47:13,915 --> 00:47:16,918
Hi. Can I make you a trade?
A cup of coffee for a ride home?

476
00:47:17,002 --> 00:47:21,298
My bike has a stupid flat, and it's
only getting ready to rain, and I--

477
00:47:21,381 --> 00:47:23,592
Well, uh, um--

478
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:28,763
- Please?
- Yeah, yeah, what the hell.

479
00:47:28,889 --> 00:47:32,225
- Okay, thank you.
- We'll put it in the trunk. Come on.

480
00:47:45,071 --> 00:47:47,532
I don't believe this.

481
00:48:15,936 --> 00:48:18,313
- Yeah.
- Hi.

482
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:23,151
- I'm gonna be a little late.
- No, no, no, no, take your time.

483
00:48:23,276 --> 00:48:25,987
No, no, I stopped off
for a cup of coffee.

484
00:48:26,071 --> 00:48:28,281
Well, uh, then have two cups.

485
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:31,159
Nothing going on here.
Just some dull old police work.

486
00:48:31,243 --> 00:48:35,789
Great, great. Tell me, uh,
how's that forklift coming?

487
00:48:39,042 --> 00:48:43,255
- I'll be about a half hour.
- Where are my doughnuts, you prick?

488
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:45,257
Maybe more.

489
00:48:52,848 --> 00:48:54,808
You really are a nice guy,
aren't you?

490
00:48:54,933 --> 00:48:58,019
- Don't say that!
- Why? You are.

491
00:48:58,103 --> 00:49:01,189
You gave me a ride home.
You're unpacking my groceries.

492
00:49:01,314 --> 00:49:04,234
You fiixed my phone.
You're nice.

493
00:49:04,317 --> 00:49:08,321
I know, I know, I know.
I'm nice. I'm nice. I hate that.

494
00:49:08,405 --> 00:49:10,866
It's a curse.

495
00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:15,537
It's like ''medium.''

496
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:19,749
I always wanted to be bad.

497
00:49:19,875 --> 00:49:22,627
Uh, these go in the sack.

498
00:49:22,711 --> 00:49:25,005
You think bad is good?

499
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:27,507
Well, yeah. I always wanted
a little bad, you know?

500
00:49:27,591 --> 00:49:29,634
I thought it would make
my nice better.

501
00:49:32,053 --> 00:49:35,640
Let me tell you something.
Bad isn't all it's cracked up to be.

502
00:49:37,309 --> 00:49:41,938
Bad is bad, and I think right now
I'd settle for a little nice.

503
00:49:43,106 --> 00:49:45,066
I think.

504
00:49:49,362 --> 00:49:51,489
What are we talking about?

505
00:49:53,533 --> 00:49:56,077
Dinner.

506
00:49:56,161 --> 00:49:58,038
Do you like Mexican food?

507
00:49:58,121 --> 00:50:02,584
I made this mean camarones veracruzanos.
You like spicy?

508
00:50:07,047 --> 00:50:08,840
I love spicy.

509
00:50:08,924 --> 00:50:12,677
Good. Well, then, you're gonna
want to marry me after this.

510
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:19,684
Oh, Chris.

511
00:50:19,768 --> 00:50:21,978
For crying out loud.

512
00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:28,610
Oh, yeah.

513
00:50:31,446 --> 00:50:34,616
We could be so hot together

514
00:50:34,699 --> 00:50:36,660
Hot together

515
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:42,791
We could be so hot together

516
00:50:42,916 --> 00:50:45,585
Together

517
00:50:45,669 --> 00:50:50,215
- Aw, this is ridiculous.
- We happened to be at the same party

518
00:50:50,298 --> 00:50:55,512
- We left it up to chance
- I'm gonna kill him.

519
00:50:55,637 --> 00:51:00,100
I was born on the Day of the Dead,
see, and it's a very big deal
in Latino cultures.

520
00:51:00,225 --> 00:51:04,688
They want it to make fun of death and
to take it seriously at the same time.

521
00:51:04,771 --> 00:51:07,774
So every year
as long as I can remember...

522
00:51:07,858 --> 00:51:11,611
someone in my family's always given me
some kind of skeleton on my birthday.

523
00:51:11,695 --> 00:51:15,532
And now I've got this full graveyard.

524
00:51:15,615 --> 00:51:17,826
We could be so hot
Hot together

525
00:51:17,951 --> 00:51:20,412
Got a big family?

526
00:51:20,495 --> 00:51:23,248
My younger brother still lives
at home with my mom except this week...

527
00:51:23,331 --> 00:51:26,751
and I've got a ton of relatives
in Veracruz.

528
00:51:26,835 --> 00:51:31,631
About your brother-- I, uh--
I happen to know a couple of cops.

529
00:51:31,715 --> 00:51:35,051
I could ask around, you know,
fiind out what's going on.

530
00:51:35,177 --> 00:51:38,847
- You think they'd tell you?
- Yeah, if they want
their phones to work.

531
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:43,476
Oh, that would be nice. Oh, God.
I'm sorry. There's that word again.

532
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:51,526
God, I like your smile.

533
00:51:54,196 --> 00:51:56,489
Excuse me.
I must be kind of drunk.

534
00:52:02,537 --> 00:52:04,915
- Maria, let me ask you something.
- What, Mr Bill?

535
00:52:07,334 --> 00:52:10,921
How come you know so much
about what's bad?

536
00:52:12,756 --> 00:52:15,300
Well...

537
00:52:15,383 --> 00:52:20,889
there was this man once,
and he was violent and crazy...

538
00:52:20,972 --> 00:52:24,559
and dangerous, and I--

539
00:52:24,643 --> 00:52:27,187
I was insane.

540
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:30,106
I was insane because
I was with him for a while.

541
00:52:30,232 --> 00:52:32,359
It's all over now.

542
00:52:34,277 --> 00:52:36,321
Did you love him?

543
00:52:38,573 --> 00:52:42,077
I was crazy, I think.

544
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:45,080
- Where is he now?
- Why do you ask?

545
00:52:46,957 --> 00:52:49,417
Why do you think?

546
00:52:55,423 --> 00:53:00,554
- I think I have to go.
- Yeah, me too. I've got the late shift.

547
00:53:00,637 --> 00:53:03,807
No, no, no, leave them.
I'll do them in a couple of years.

548
00:53:07,769 --> 00:53:11,523
You want to know what
the best thing you said tonight was?

549
00:53:11,648 --> 00:53:13,608
What?

550
00:53:13,733 --> 00:53:17,320
- That you liked my smile.
- Oh.

551
00:53:17,404 --> 00:53:20,907
I know, I know, I know.
I'm nice. I know.

552
00:53:24,369 --> 00:53:26,496
I'm not that nice.

553
00:53:34,129 --> 00:53:36,173
Honey, I'm home.

554
00:53:37,799 --> 00:53:40,260
I bumped into her
at the goddam store.

555
00:53:40,343 --> 00:53:43,680
What was I supposed to do,
pretend that I'd never seen her before?

556
00:53:48,059 --> 00:53:52,439
Anyway, we're supposed to be watching
the house, right? So I was watching
the house from the inside.

557
00:53:54,274 --> 00:53:56,818
Nothing. Here are your doughnuts.
Here. I didn't eat one of them.

558
00:53:56,902 --> 00:53:59,988
There's a glaze on it and everything.
I got you some Pringles and some Oreos.

559
00:54:00,113 --> 00:54:02,324
You, uh, gonna get together
with her again?

560
00:54:02,449 --> 00:54:05,368
- Maybe go to see a movie maybe?
- Oh, give me a break. Come on.
Hey, she made me some dinner.

561
00:54:05,493 --> 00:54:07,787
- That was it.
- Nothing more?

562
00:54:09,623 --> 00:54:11,416
Nothing more.

563
00:54:12,751 --> 00:54:15,837
Okay, Mr Liar.

564
00:54:15,921 --> 00:54:19,007
Sergeant Bernie called,
said that Reynaldo McGuire...

565
00:54:19,132 --> 00:54:22,135
was arrested on the 1 7th
for a GTA.

566
00:54:22,219 --> 00:54:24,262
Wouldn't just happen to be
any relation, would it?

567
00:54:24,387 --> 00:54:28,517
Give me a break, will you?
She told me her brother was in jail.

568
00:54:28,642 --> 00:54:31,019
I checked it out.
I thought it was a lead.

569
00:54:31,144 --> 00:54:34,314
- A lead?
- Yeah. A lead.

570
00:54:34,439 --> 00:54:38,568
Okay. Fine. You tell me you're checking
out a lead, I'm gonna believe you're--

571
00:54:38,693 --> 00:54:40,820
Checking out a lead.

572
00:54:40,904 --> 00:54:43,114
I realize this is a shit detail.

573
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:46,993
Oh, boy. I mean, can we talk, you know?
Nobody's really gonna care what we do.

574
00:54:47,118 --> 00:54:49,246
- Bottom of the barrel.
- Right.

575
00:54:49,371 --> 00:54:54,167
But I would appreciate that you not
act like a walking hard-on
while we're working together.

576
00:54:54,251 --> 00:54:56,294
Excuse me.

577
00:54:59,297 --> 00:55:01,007
Succinctly put.

578
00:55:14,563 --> 00:55:17,232
All the money
in the cash register right now.

579
00:55:18,984 --> 00:55:21,528
Okay, okay.
Take it easy.

580
00:55:23,947 --> 00:55:27,033
Reach me up and get me
a hunting knife, would you, please?

581
00:55:48,513 --> 00:55:50,974
Sorry, buddy, we're closed.

582
00:56:07,657 --> 00:56:10,577
- Seventy-two.
- What do we got? What do we got?

583
00:56:10,702 --> 00:56:12,913
- Two seventy-three.
- All right. That's plenty, man.

584
00:56:12,996 --> 00:56:15,040
That's all we need.
All we need is gas money.

585
00:56:15,165 --> 00:56:18,335
- Yeah, it's hardly worth
rubbing people out for.
- What?

586
00:56:18,418 --> 00:56:20,629
Nothin'.

587
00:56:29,930 --> 00:56:32,933
What did I do now?

588
00:56:33,016 --> 00:56:35,227
Reynaldo, right?

589
00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:37,979
Ray.

590
00:56:38,063 --> 00:56:41,733
I heard you got yourself
into a little trouble.

591
00:56:41,816 --> 00:56:44,277
You a cop?

592
00:56:44,402 --> 00:56:47,572
- You a criminal?
- No.

593
00:56:47,656 --> 00:56:50,116
This girl's father's got it in for me.

594
00:56:50,242 --> 00:56:53,161
He does, huh?

595
00:56:53,286 --> 00:56:55,080
Why?

596
00:56:55,163 --> 00:56:57,916
He doesn't want me
seeing his daughter.

597
00:56:59,459 --> 00:57:03,046
- She's pretty precious, huh?
- Yeah.

598
00:57:04,256 --> 00:57:07,092
So why'd you hot-wire the car?

599
00:57:08,301 --> 00:57:10,929
We thought it'd be okay.

600
00:57:13,098 --> 00:57:15,392
I was stupid.

601
00:57:17,769 --> 00:57:21,022
It's not very pleasant
being in here, is it?

602
00:57:21,106 --> 00:57:23,859
Why do you care?

603
00:57:23,984 --> 00:57:27,904
I just want to fiind out what kind
of a guy you are before I get you out.

604
00:57:30,365 --> 00:57:34,494
Get me out. I can't take
another night in this place.

605
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:39,833
You like to work with your hands?

606
00:57:39,916 --> 00:57:43,336
I got a job here, construction.
Starts Monday morning, 7:30 to 5:00.

607
00:57:43,461 --> 00:57:47,048
Five days a week.
Got to be home every night.

608
00:57:47,132 --> 00:57:49,801
That's the deal.

609
00:57:49,885 --> 00:57:52,012
Every night.

610
00:57:52,137 --> 00:57:54,806
Take it and you're out of here.

611
00:57:54,890 --> 00:57:58,143
Mess with me and you're right back in.
What do you say?

612
00:57:58,226 --> 00:58:00,604
Deal.

613
00:58:02,606 --> 00:58:04,566
Okay.

614
00:58:12,991 --> 00:58:15,702
What rock did they fiind you under?

615
00:58:17,787 --> 00:58:22,083
Anything I can do to make your
stay here more pleasant, buddy,
you just let me know.

616
00:58:34,054 --> 00:58:37,474
- Great.
- Hey, Lecce, I want to talk to you.

617
00:58:40,685 --> 00:58:43,939
- You should be getting some sleep.
What are you doing?
- I heard you wanted to talk to me.

618
00:58:44,022 --> 00:58:49,319
Yeah, a couple of cops sitting
on a stake-out in fourth precinct
just got caught on a procedure.

619
00:58:49,402 --> 00:58:52,572
Seems they got overanxious,
blew their cover.

620
00:58:52,697 --> 00:58:55,784
I don't want this to happen here.
You pass it on.

621
00:58:55,867 --> 00:58:59,204
- No funny stuff.
- No funny stuff. Okay, got it.
- Right. Right.

622
00:58:59,287 --> 00:59:01,414
Okay, you got it. You got it.
No funny stuff.

623
00:59:01,498 --> 00:59:03,708
Excuse me!
Bill, how are you?

624
00:59:03,792 --> 00:59:05,919
- I'm okay. I'm okay.
- What are you doing here?

625
00:59:06,044 --> 00:59:10,340
Well, I just had, uh, a, uh, you know.
No, no, no, what are you doing here?

626
00:59:10,423 --> 00:59:13,927
- I heard you were
supposed to be at work.
- Well, I was, but they let me off early
so I could see my brother.

627
00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:18,473
- You know, they only have
certain hours here, and--
- Hey, fiishman.

628
00:59:18,598 --> 00:59:21,685
One day we dance again, okay?

629
00:59:21,768 --> 00:59:26,398
- Are you in some kind of trouble?
- No, no, no. He's just a funny friend.
- Hey, Chris.

630
00:59:26,481 --> 00:59:28,692
Listen, this is a really bad time
to talk to me. Could I--

631
00:59:28,817 --> 00:59:31,528
Could I call you up, give you a call?
I gotta make a couple of calls.

632
00:59:31,611 --> 00:59:35,907
And after I make those calls,
we'll probably, you know,
make-- call you after.

633
00:59:57,512 --> 00:59:59,806
Come on. Come on.

634
01:00:20,869 --> 01:00:23,705
- Great.
- Hey, fellas. What do you got?

635
01:00:23,830 --> 01:00:26,583
Uh, the usual.
Logged fiive calls today.

636
01:00:26,708 --> 01:00:29,794
One from Gail, some friend of hers
that just had a fiight with her husband.

637
01:00:29,878 --> 01:00:32,881
And one from her mother about
a recipe for some sort of shrimp dish.

638
01:00:32,964 --> 01:00:35,008
Oh, a recipe, huh?
Good, good.

639
01:00:35,133 --> 01:00:37,344
At least my wife
will get something out of this.

640
01:00:37,427 --> 01:00:39,638
- She over there now?
- She been gone a couple of hours.

641
01:00:39,763 --> 01:00:42,224
This recorder took a dump.
You gotta pick up a new one.

642
01:00:42,307 --> 01:00:44,684
- Come on, Winston.
- Good night, gentlemen.

643
01:00:44,768 --> 01:00:46,728
Good night.

644
01:00:51,525 --> 01:00:54,069
Come on.
Let's get the hell out of here.

645
01:01:11,002 --> 01:01:13,380
Winston!
Chris, you son of a bitch!

646
01:01:13,505 --> 01:01:17,634
- Winston!
- This is not funny!

647
01:01:28,353 --> 01:01:31,940
- You are really something,
you know that? You keep me young.
- You like that?

648
01:01:32,065 --> 01:01:35,402
- Yeah.
- Listen, the recorder's totally shot,
so I gotta go pick up a new one.

649
01:01:35,527 --> 01:01:37,988
- All right.
- Leave it to Phil and Jack, right?
- How long will you be gone?

650
01:01:38,071 --> 01:01:40,824
- About an hour.
- Okay, I'll see you then.

651
01:01:44,327 --> 01:01:47,080
Jesus, they're immature!

652
01:01:59,426 --> 01:02:01,303
Come on.

653
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:08,143
- How much longer, man?
- Finished. This carburettor sucks.

654
01:02:08,268 --> 01:02:12,898
- It's as useful as a diet crouton.
- Come on. Let's get out of here.

655
01:02:21,531 --> 01:02:26,328
Think about it
There must be higher love

656
01:02:31,041 --> 01:02:33,168
Really no trick
to this, you know.

657
01:02:33,293 --> 01:02:35,587
You're just gonna call her up
on the phone and tell her that
you can't see her any more.

658
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:39,799
It's really as simple as that.

659
01:02:39,883 --> 01:02:43,929
It's as simple as that.
Not gonna ruin your career.

660
01:02:56,191 --> 01:02:58,151
- Hello?
- Hello.

661
01:02:58,276 --> 01:03:01,947
It's, uh, uh, Bill.

662
01:03:02,072 --> 01:03:05,742
- Hi, how are you?
- I'm okay. Look, the reason I called--

663
01:03:05,825 --> 01:03:08,662
Uh, there are some things that
you and I have to get straight here.

664
01:03:08,745 --> 01:03:11,915
- You know, I have very good taste.
- Pardon me?

665
01:03:11,998 --> 01:03:14,751
Yeah, I've got good taste in food,
I've got good taste in music...

666
01:03:14,876 --> 01:03:17,254
but most of all I've got
great taste in men.

667
01:03:17,379 --> 01:03:21,299
I'm not quite sure
what we're talking about.

668
01:03:21,383 --> 01:03:25,428
I'm talking about you.
What you did for my brother Ray,
what you did for me.

669
01:03:25,554 --> 01:03:28,890
Oh, oh, that.

670
01:03:28,974 --> 01:03:34,020
''Oh, that. '' What do you mean,
''Oh, that''? It was a very good thing,
what you and your police friend did.

671
01:03:34,104 --> 01:03:36,857
My brother's out offjail.
He's got a new fjob.

672
01:03:36,982 --> 01:03:41,278
My mother wants to marry you.
My brother wants to marry you.

673
01:03:41,403 --> 01:03:43,780
Yeah?
What about you?

674
01:03:45,782 --> 01:03:49,619
- Maria?
- Yes?

675
01:03:49,703 --> 01:03:52,706
Uh, wait.
Uh, uh, wait a minute.

676
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:56,168
- Uh, could you hold on just a second?
- Sure.
- Thank you.

677
01:03:56,293 --> 01:03:59,045
Don't be such a wuss!

678
01:04:03,049 --> 01:04:06,636
Look, Maria, there are things
about me that you don't know.

679
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:09,806
Well, there are things you
don't know about me either.
Isn't that why people go out?

680
01:04:09,890 --> 01:04:14,186
Yeah, yeah, they do. But th-th-there
are things about me that I--

681
01:04:14,269 --> 01:04:17,689
- That I can't tell you.
- Are you in some kind of trouble?

682
01:04:17,814 --> 01:04:20,901
- Kind of.
- With the law?

683
01:04:21,026 --> 01:04:23,486
Uh, in a way.
Look, your food is burning.

684
01:04:23,612 --> 01:04:26,948
- Your-your-your food is, uh--
- Shit!

685
01:04:27,699 --> 01:04:29,659
God!

686
01:04:33,788 --> 01:04:37,918
- How'd you know her food was burning?
- How'd you know my food was burning?

687
01:04:39,252 --> 01:04:44,299
- Pardon me?
- My food was burning. How did you know?
You psychic or something?

688
01:04:44,424 --> 01:04:48,970
No, no, I'm not psychic.
I-- I heard the sizzling behind you.

689
01:04:50,555 --> 01:04:54,768
Oh. You have pretty good ears.
Yeah.

690
01:04:54,851 --> 01:04:57,145
Look, Maria...

691
01:04:58,396 --> 01:05:01,399
I just can't see you for a while.

692
01:05:02,859 --> 01:05:06,196
You-- You don't want to see--

693
01:05:09,866 --> 01:05:13,995
Look, this-- this really isn't
a very good time right now.

694
01:05:15,539 --> 01:05:18,375
I-I-I have to be at work
in half an hour, so could you
give me your number?

695
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:20,877
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- My home number?

696
01:05:21,002 --> 01:05:23,046
Yeah. You do have a phone, don't you?

697
01:05:23,171 --> 01:05:25,549
Yeah. Yeah, what do you think?

698
01:05:25,674 --> 01:05:28,134
Of course I got a phone,
but I'm-- I'm hardly ever there.

699
01:05:28,218 --> 01:05:32,347
- Then I'll call you at the office.
- No, no, no, no, I'm hardly ever there.

700
01:05:32,472 --> 01:05:37,185
All right, um, home is better.
555-5050.

701
01:05:38,854 --> 01:05:42,107
Yeah. Okay, okay.

702
01:05:42,190 --> 01:05:44,651
Okay, okay.

703
01:05:45,777 --> 01:05:48,780
- Everything okay?
- Okay.

704
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:03,670
- Hello?
- Hi, it's Maria.

705
01:06:04,796 --> 01:06:07,090
Hi.

706
01:06:07,215 --> 01:06:09,342
Hi.
What's wrong?

707
01:06:09,467 --> 01:06:11,761
Did I wake you?

708
01:06:11,845 --> 01:06:15,432
No, no, no, no, no.
It's okay.

709
01:06:15,515 --> 01:06:18,435
- Where are you?
- I'm at home.
Now, you listen to me, fella.

710
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:22,230
Just because you said you're having
a little bit of trouble doesn't mean
I'm gonna let you off the hook.

711
01:06:22,314 --> 01:06:24,524
Holy shit!

712
01:06:35,076 --> 01:06:37,454
- I can't talk now.
-Are you all right?

713
01:06:37,579 --> 01:06:41,166
- I have to call you back.
- What is it? Is it the police?

714
01:06:41,291 --> 01:06:43,084
Hello? Bill?

715
01:06:50,675 --> 01:06:53,053
- Bill.
- Bill.

716
01:07:16,076 --> 01:07:18,453
Fifteen minutes early.
Must be some kind of record.

717
01:07:18,537 --> 01:07:20,664
So, everything okay?
What's up?

718
01:07:20,789 --> 01:07:23,166
- Got a phone call today.
- Oh, yeah? New recipe?

719
01:07:23,291 --> 01:07:26,795
Uh-uh. Guy named Bill.

720
01:07:26,878 --> 01:07:29,631
Hey, let me see. Okay, I'll take
this downtown, check it out.

721
01:07:29,756 --> 01:07:31,883
Uh-uh. We will take this downtown.

722
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:34,177
Tried to disguise his voice,
but I think it was Montgomery.

723
01:07:34,261 --> 01:07:38,390
Nap time's over, boys.
Better keep your eyes open tonight.

724
01:07:38,515 --> 01:07:42,644
- Come on.
- Bill?
- Come on.

725
01:07:42,769 --> 01:07:44,896
Good night, gentlemen.

726
01:07:44,980 --> 01:07:48,316
Those bastards, man. I smell a rat.
They are up to something.

727
01:07:48,441 --> 01:07:51,444
I don't know what it is yet,
but they're up to something.

728
01:07:51,528 --> 01:07:54,072
I'm gonna fiind out, though.

729
01:07:54,155 --> 01:07:56,199
You know what it is?

730
01:07:57,325 --> 01:08:00,245
Yeah. Yeah, I have
a pretty good idea what it is.

731
01:08:00,328 --> 01:08:02,372
What? What? Tell me.

732
01:08:10,964 --> 01:08:12,841
Son of a bitch!

733
01:08:12,924 --> 01:08:15,218
Christ, I am gonna kill them!

734
01:08:41,828 --> 01:08:45,165
-Just let me in for a minute.
- She's not here. Tony!
- Get out of the way.

735
01:08:45,248 --> 01:08:48,919
- Cover me! Armed man
going into her house!
- What?

736
01:08:52,589 --> 01:08:56,718
- Gail? Oh, Gail?
- Tony, I haven't seen her
in a long time.

737
01:08:56,843 --> 01:09:00,180
Gail's here. Gail, where are you?
Shut up, Maria. Every goddam time!

738
01:09:00,263 --> 01:09:05,644
- Get your goddam hands off me,
you son of a bitch!
- It's not our guy.

739
01:09:05,727 --> 01:09:11,107
- Get out of my house!
- I never thought I'd hit a woman,
but-- Ow!Jeez, ouch!

740
01:09:12,025 --> 01:09:13,985
Oh, for crying out loud.

741
01:09:14,069 --> 01:09:17,072
Every time something happens,
we end up fucking it up,
and she comes over here!

742
01:09:17,155 --> 01:09:19,616
- Stop it!
- Tell me where that--
Every time something goes wrong--

743
01:09:19,741 --> 01:09:22,202
- I'm not gonna tell you again.
She's not here.
- Anybody home?

744
01:09:24,204 --> 01:09:26,248
Gee, I, uh--
You left the door open.

745
01:09:26,373 --> 01:09:29,125
- Bill!
- Who the fuck are you?

746
01:09:29,209 --> 01:09:32,295
I'm a friend of Maria's.
I came over for dinner.

747
01:09:32,420 --> 01:09:34,965
- What's up?
- I'm looking for my wife.

748
01:09:35,048 --> 01:09:37,676
- Where'd you leave her, pal?
- She's here.

749
01:09:37,759 --> 01:09:41,888
- He thinks he can barge right in here.
- She ran out. She's hiding!

750
01:09:41,972 --> 01:09:44,349
- Is she here?
- No. That's what I've been
trying to tell him.

751
01:09:44,474 --> 01:09:47,185
I think maybe you made a mistake.
What do you say, pal?

752
01:09:47,269 --> 01:09:50,021
Go to hell!

753
01:09:50,105 --> 01:09:53,191
Let's call the cops.
I want him out of my house!
I want you to call the cops.

754
01:09:53,316 --> 01:09:57,863
Why don't I help you look for her?
Huh? What do you say? Hey, Gail! Gail!

755
01:09:58,864 --> 01:10:01,241
Oh, gee, I'm real sorry.

756
01:10:01,324 --> 01:10:03,785
Just relax. Calm down.
Now, there's a chair right behind you.

757
01:10:03,910 --> 01:10:06,288
When I lift you up, you're gonna
put your ass right down in that chair.

758
01:10:06,371 --> 01:10:08,331
All right? One--

759
01:10:13,753 --> 01:10:17,174
We're doing okay.
We're doing just fiine.

760
01:10:17,257 --> 01:10:20,510
Now, your knee is bad, huh?
That's it.Just relax.

761
01:10:20,635 --> 01:10:23,972
We'll get you some ice for the knee,
and we'll get you some aspirin
for your head, okay?

762
01:10:24,097 --> 01:10:27,184
- Could we have some aspirin?
And some ice.
- Yeah.

763
01:10:27,309 --> 01:10:30,729
We're doing okay.
We're doing fiine.

764
01:10:30,854 --> 01:10:34,024
Now, I don't think it would be
a very good idea for you
to talk to Gail right now, because...

765
01:10:34,107 --> 01:10:38,320
you've been drinking,
and you say pretty mean things
when you've been drinking, right?

766
01:10:41,072 --> 01:10:43,700
Thank you.
Thanks a lot.

767
01:10:45,535 --> 01:10:47,996
- What's your drink?
- Little rye and Coke.

768
01:10:48,079 --> 01:10:51,917
Rye and Coke?
That used to be my drink.

769
01:10:52,042 --> 01:10:56,338
Give me your hand. Yeah,
I used to get these diamond splinter
headaches right between my eyes.

770
01:10:56,421 --> 01:11:00,467
Right there. It was murderous.
You ever get those things?

771
01:11:00,592 --> 01:11:02,802
- No.
- No?

772
01:11:02,928 --> 01:11:05,680
Well, I guess it must
have been me, huh?

773
01:11:06,848 --> 01:11:10,769
We're doing okay.
We're doing fiine.

774
01:11:10,894 --> 01:11:14,147
- How about some coffee?
- Yeah, coffee's good.

775
01:11:14,272 --> 01:11:18,401
Yeah, we'll have some coffee,
we'll calm down, talk about Gail.

776
01:11:18,485 --> 01:11:21,738
- Can we have some coffee please?
- Sure.

777
01:11:39,297 --> 01:11:43,301
- I'm impressed.
- I was just in the neighbourhood.

778
01:11:43,385 --> 01:11:46,471
I'm beginning to like
this neighbourhood more and more.

779
01:11:47,764 --> 01:11:50,934
I was a little worried
after that phone call.

780
01:11:51,017 --> 01:11:54,437
Yeah, yeah, well,
I was kind of out of it...

781
01:11:54,521 --> 01:11:56,898
but, uh, I guess this
isn't the best time, eh?

782
01:11:56,982 --> 01:11:59,651
Uh-uh. A date's a date.

783
01:11:59,734 --> 01:12:03,488
Oh, look, Maria, I'm--
I'm really involved--

784
01:12:03,572 --> 01:12:08,118
There's nothing to fear
Baby, now that you're near me

785
01:12:08,201 --> 01:12:12,497
I've never seen anything so clearly

786
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:20,714
- Oh, boy.
- This night was made for one thing only

787
01:12:20,839 --> 01:12:25,135
To come as close as we can come

788
01:12:25,218 --> 01:12:29,139
This night was made
for one thing only

789
01:12:29,264 --> 01:12:34,853
It's such a change
Someone nice like you

790
01:12:34,978 --> 01:12:36,938
Oh, boy.

791
01:12:38,648 --> 01:12:41,651
I'm in over my head here.

792
01:12:41,735 --> 01:12:44,446
- Stay with me.
- Maria--

793
01:12:46,448 --> 01:12:48,909
You don't want me
to break my phone, do you?

794
01:12:49,034 --> 01:12:52,204
If I do, they'll send
somebody else here.

795
01:12:53,205 --> 01:12:57,250
We've gotta keep rising

796
01:12:57,334 --> 01:12:59,461
And never let go

797
01:12:59,544 --> 01:13:04,424
I won't ever let you say goodbye

798
01:13:04,508 --> 01:13:06,801
Oh, Bill.

799
01:13:06,927 --> 01:13:11,556
- Fuck Bill.
- This night was made for one thing only

800
01:13:11,681 --> 01:13:15,894
- To come as close as we can come
- So let it begin

801
01:13:15,977 --> 01:13:18,730
This night was made
for one thing only

802
01:13:18,813 --> 01:13:23,026
- Never let go
- To come as close as we can come

803
01:13:23,109 --> 01:13:27,030
- Where do we begin
- Begin

804
01:13:27,113 --> 01:13:31,326
- You could fjust hold me
- Just hold me

805
01:13:31,409 --> 01:13:35,413
- Where do we begin
- Where do we begin

806
01:13:35,497 --> 01:13:39,709
- You could fjust hold me
- You could fjust hold me

807
01:13:39,793 --> 01:13:42,462
Where do we begin

808
01:14:07,529 --> 01:14:09,489
God!

809
01:15:45,877 --> 01:15:48,004
I had a bad dream.

810
01:15:51,383 --> 01:15:54,553
Oh, scary monsters.

811
01:15:54,636 --> 01:15:57,013
Where'd they get you?
Here?

812
01:15:57,097 --> 01:15:59,140
Here.

813
01:15:59,224 --> 01:16:01,101
Here?

814
01:16:28,879 --> 01:16:31,798
- What time is it?
- Seven thirty. What--

815
01:16:31,882 --> 01:16:34,092
Jesus Christ!

816
01:16:36,011 --> 01:16:38,763
What's wrong?

817
01:16:38,889 --> 01:16:41,266
- It's morning.
- Are you gonna be late for work?

818
01:16:41,349 --> 01:16:44,769
- Uh-huh.
- Could you call and tell them
you'll be a little late, maybe?

819
01:16:44,895 --> 01:16:47,272
- Mm-mm. Mm-mm.
- No?

820
01:16:54,529 --> 01:16:58,200
- Listen, uh, you think
you could lend me a hat?
- A hat?

821
01:16:58,325 --> 01:17:03,121
Yeah, yeah, a hat. I got this really bad
skin condition, and it's very dangerous
for me to go out in the sun.

822
01:17:03,205 --> 01:17:05,248
- Like a rash?
- Yeah, yeah, like a rash.

823
01:17:05,373 --> 01:17:09,836
- It's-- It's-- But it's worse.
- Oh. Is this one of the things
you don't want to tell me about?

824
01:17:09,961 --> 01:17:14,090
No, no, no, no, it's nothing, really.
It's nothing serious.

825
01:17:21,681 --> 01:17:24,601
I'm not sure it's your colour.

826
01:17:26,561 --> 01:17:28,605
Seems perfectly fiine.

827
01:17:31,107 --> 01:17:34,027
- Much better.
- Thank you.

828
01:17:34,152 --> 01:17:37,822
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

829
01:17:39,282 --> 01:17:43,203
I really got you
thinking now, don't I?

830
01:17:43,328 --> 01:17:45,789
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

831
01:17:45,914 --> 01:17:49,084
- Could I borrow this?
- It's yours.

832
01:17:56,925 --> 01:18:00,512
What are you waving at, huh?
Huh? Who you waving at?

833
01:18:03,431 --> 01:18:06,601
Hey,Jack.Jack! This may be him.
Get on that horn, eh?

834
01:18:06,726 --> 01:18:09,104
- Oh, right.
- Get on that horn.

835
01:18:11,773 --> 01:18:13,817
Lynn,Jack Pismo,
Speck Road stake-out.

836
01:18:13,942 --> 01:18:15,902
We have a man
running from the house.

837
01:18:16,027 --> 01:18:17,988
Caucasian, about fiive-ten.

838
01:18:18,113 --> 01:18:20,782
Jeans, jacket, pink hat,
and he's heading south.

839
01:18:20,907 --> 01:18:24,661
Caucasian, fiive-ten, jeans,
jacket, pink hat?

840
01:18:24,786 --> 01:18:27,622
Yeah, pink hat and a shawl.
He's heading south.

841
01:18:29,833 --> 01:18:32,836
- Excuse me. My fault. My fault. Sorry.
- What are you doing?

842
01:18:55,275 --> 01:18:56,985
No, no, back it up!

843
01:19:00,197 --> 01:19:02,657
Asshole.

844
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:12,894
Get away from me!
Get down!

845
01:20:12,978 --> 01:20:15,814
Get away from me!
Down!

846
01:20:30,245 --> 01:20:33,164
Come on, come on!
Get in!

847
01:20:50,348 --> 01:20:52,642
Did we, uh, practise safe sex?

848
01:20:57,898 --> 01:21:00,817
- Hello?
- Hi, it's Maria.

849
01:21:00,901 --> 01:21:05,947
- Hi. Hi. What's wrong?
- Did I wake you?

850
01:21:06,031 --> 01:21:09,618
No, no, no, no, no.
It's okay.

851
01:21:09,701 --> 01:21:12,537
- Where are you?
- I'm at home.
Now, you listen to me, fella.

852
01:21:12,662 --> 01:21:16,249
Just because you said you're having
a little bit of trouble doesn't mean
I'm gonna let you off the hook.

853
01:21:16,374 --> 01:21:18,585
Holy shit!

854
01:21:29,054 --> 01:21:31,723
- I can't talk now.
-Are you all right?

855
01:21:31,848 --> 01:21:35,268
- I have to call you back.
- What is it? Is it the police?

856
01:21:35,393 --> 01:21:36,853
Hello? Bill?

857
01:21:37,729 --> 01:21:44,236
We also have a videotape of a man
leaving the Speck Road house.

858
01:21:46,530 --> 01:21:48,406
Now, we don't know if
it's the same man that's on the phone...

859
01:21:48,490 --> 01:21:51,660
or if he has any relationship
with Montgomery.

860
01:21:51,785 --> 01:21:53,828
We're not taking any chances.

861
01:21:57,123 --> 01:21:59,709
We also found this.

862
01:22:05,882 --> 01:22:10,679
''Bill''? I mean, that's
the last fuckin' straw. You break it--

863
01:22:12,764 --> 01:22:15,851
Good night.

864
01:22:15,934 --> 01:22:19,020
Hey, hey, hey, I'm serious, man.
It ends right here.

865
01:22:19,104 --> 01:22:21,314
Either you break it off,
or you get your ass reassigned...

866
01:22:21,398 --> 01:22:23,358
'cause I'm not
goin' down with you!

867
01:22:23,483 --> 01:22:27,320
I busted my ass to make detective
before 30. I'm not gonna
let you fuck that up!

868
01:22:29,114 --> 01:22:31,074
You got that, Chris?

869
01:22:33,326 --> 01:22:35,787
Yeah, I got that.

870
01:22:41,042 --> 01:22:43,712
You used to be a hell
of a cop, man.

871
01:22:43,837 --> 01:22:45,797
Get your shit together.

872
01:22:57,559 --> 01:22:59,603
Ah.

873
01:23:02,272 --> 01:23:06,735
Uh-oh, bacon on the left.
Bacon burgers on the left.

874
01:23:06,860 --> 01:23:10,739
- Great.
- God damn it!

875
01:23:10,864 --> 01:23:14,701
All right. Get in the back.
Use the shotgun.

876
01:23:14,784 --> 01:23:17,245
- I'm not shootin' at cops!
- Get in the back, man.

877
01:23:17,329 --> 01:23:19,789
How far are you
gonna take this?

878
01:23:38,725 --> 01:23:40,435
Yeah!

879
01:24:18,431 --> 01:24:21,017
Watch this.

880
01:24:26,147 --> 01:24:28,108
Oh, yeah.

881
01:24:29,943 --> 01:24:31,903
Shit!

882
01:24:34,698 --> 01:24:37,450
Ah!Jesus!

883
01:24:42,163 --> 01:24:44,624
Hang on, little buddy.
I'm gonna jam 'em.

884
01:24:59,514 --> 01:25:02,684
- Doin' all right?
- No.
-Just hang in there.

885
01:25:31,630 --> 01:25:35,050
Oh, fuck. It's over, man.

886
01:25:35,175 --> 01:25:38,178
It's over.

887
01:25:42,057 --> 01:25:45,143
It's never over till it's over.
Keep your head down, man.

888
01:25:45,268 --> 01:25:49,189
- Keep your head down!
- Oh, it's gotta stop, man.

889
01:25:56,696 --> 01:25:59,199
Whoa. Whoa!

890
01:26:27,561 --> 01:26:31,064
- Hope this road goes somewhere.
- We're never gonna get
out of this!

891
01:27:43,428 --> 01:27:46,181
- What the hell are you doing?
- We're blowin' this pop stand.

892
01:27:46,306 --> 01:27:49,559
- It's over.
- They got Montgomery?

893
01:27:49,684 --> 01:27:52,521
Yeah, a couple hours ago.
Couldn't get many details...

894
01:27:52,646 --> 01:27:54,689
but apparently
there was some big shoot-out.

895
01:27:54,773 --> 01:27:57,776
Their car ended up
in the Nisqually River,
and no one came out.

896
01:27:57,859 --> 01:28:00,779
So, we get a pat on the back...

897
01:28:00,904 --> 01:28:03,740
job well done, next case.

898
01:28:15,961 --> 01:28:19,047
You know, you are one
lucky son of a bitch.

899
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:32,811
- What are you gonna do about her?
- Oh, man, I--

900
01:28:33,937 --> 01:28:36,398
I think I love her.
I really do.

901
01:28:36,481 --> 01:28:38,942
Well, I'd hate to think you
risked it all just 'cause you liked her.

902
01:28:41,027 --> 01:28:43,154
Yeah, yeah.

903
01:28:44,322 --> 01:28:47,909
Now comes the hard part.
Say, how do you feel...

904
01:28:48,034 --> 01:28:50,161
about going across the street
and telling her that I'm a cop...

905
01:28:50,245 --> 01:28:52,622
and I'm not a phone man
and I've been lying to her
and I've been taking pictures...

906
01:28:52,747 --> 01:28:55,834
- and looking at her
through telescopes and--
- Uh-uh. No.

907
01:28:55,917 --> 01:28:59,171
Yeah. I didn't think
you'd like that.

908
01:28:59,254 --> 01:29:02,007
You know, I always thought
it would be you that screwed up.

909
01:29:02,090 --> 01:29:05,510
Well, maybe I'll learn
from your mistakes.

910
01:29:05,635 --> 01:29:07,929
- Probably not.
- Probably not. No.

911
01:29:08,013 --> 01:29:10,599
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

912
01:29:13,685 --> 01:29:15,478
The force of the water
against the car...

913
01:29:15,604 --> 01:29:18,607
is making it extremely difficult
to pull it from the river.

914
01:29:18,690 --> 01:29:21,276
It is not yet confirmed, but it
is believed that the body...

915
01:29:21,401 --> 01:29:25,697
of escaped prisoner Richard ''Stick''
Montgomery is still trapped inside.

916
01:29:25,780 --> 01:29:29,451
The body of his cousin, Caylor Reese,
was found two miles downriver.

917
01:29:29,534 --> 01:29:32,454
- Normally, police divers would have
tried to pull Montgomery free...
- Hi.

918
01:29:32,537 --> 01:29:34,497
but due to the car's
precarious position...

919
01:29:34,623 --> 01:29:38,543
and the force of the water,
that has not been possible.

920
01:29:42,631 --> 01:29:44,591
Are you all right?

921
01:29:47,636 --> 01:29:50,305
I know. I know.

922
01:30:02,108 --> 01:30:04,152
- Maybe we should talk.
- Uh-huh.

923
01:30:07,239 --> 01:30:09,282
You're wanted by the law,
aren't you?

924
01:30:10,617 --> 01:30:12,744
Is that what you think?

925
01:30:12,827 --> 01:30:16,414
Well, I heard sirens
this morning after you left.

926
01:30:19,084 --> 01:30:21,211
The police follow you here?

927
01:30:24,506 --> 01:30:29,719
I don't think I realized
until just now the size of the hole
that I dug for myself.

928
01:30:29,845 --> 01:30:32,305
How much trouble are you in?

929
01:30:36,351 --> 01:30:39,604
You're not gonna like me
very much when I tell you this.

930
01:30:39,688 --> 01:30:42,941
Oh, God. I never should've
let this happen.

931
01:30:44,734 --> 01:30:46,862
But I did.

932
01:30:46,987 --> 01:30:49,656
I want you to know,
before you start hating me--

933
01:30:49,781 --> 01:30:53,618
and you will start hating me--
that I've fallen in love with you.

934
01:30:53,702 --> 01:30:55,829
Don't, don't, don't.

935
01:30:57,330 --> 01:31:00,250
Don't interrupt a confession.

936
01:31:08,967 --> 01:31:12,387
I don't work
for the phone company.

937
01:31:12,512 --> 01:31:16,349
And my name is not Bill.
It's Chris.

938
01:31:18,226 --> 01:31:21,646
- You're a cop?
- I'm a detective.

939
01:31:23,190 --> 01:31:27,652
I'm staking out the home
of an ex-girlfriend
of an escaped federal prisoner.

940
01:31:29,362 --> 01:31:33,408
You've been watching me?
From where?

941
01:31:35,619 --> 01:31:38,288
Across the street.

942
01:31:44,961 --> 01:31:46,922
And my phones?

943
01:31:51,510 --> 01:31:53,136
Maria.

944
01:31:54,721 --> 01:31:56,848
Listen to me!

945
01:31:59,643 --> 01:32:02,187
In there, huh?

946
01:32:02,312 --> 01:32:04,439
Uh-oh.

947
01:32:06,316 --> 01:32:08,985
Maria.

948
01:32:15,242 --> 01:32:17,536
What do you got there, huh?

949
01:32:38,723 --> 01:32:40,767
Well--

950
01:32:44,479 --> 01:32:47,649
You guys are great.

951
01:32:49,401 --> 01:32:52,320
I hope I-- I hope
I didn't disappoint you.

952
01:32:59,744 --> 01:33:03,415
Maria. Maria! God damn it!

953
01:33:03,498 --> 01:33:07,627
Maria, listen to me!
Hold it a minute! Would you--

954
01:33:07,752 --> 01:33:09,629
- Would you-- Listen to me!
- No! Stop!

955
01:33:09,713 --> 01:33:13,758
Hear me! I was doing
my job, God damn it!

956
01:33:13,842 --> 01:33:17,512
Now, whether you like it or whether I
like it, it doesn't make any difference.

957
01:33:17,596 --> 01:33:22,642
There wasn't any fun in it, and what
happened between you and me was--

958
01:33:24,060 --> 01:33:26,521
was not part of it--
it was my mistake.

959
01:33:29,733 --> 01:33:31,776
Maria.

960
01:33:37,115 --> 01:33:39,492
I wanted to tell you.
I just-- I couldn't.

961
01:33:43,330 --> 01:33:45,916
You son of a bitch!

962
01:34:17,072 --> 01:34:18,949
Oh, no!

963
01:34:21,785 --> 01:34:24,704
You broke my heart.

964
01:34:30,836 --> 01:34:32,879
They said you were dead. I--

965
01:34:39,219 --> 01:34:41,429
Oh!

966
01:34:46,601 --> 01:34:48,728
Oh,Jesus Christ.

967
01:34:50,522 --> 01:34:52,816
I made it.

968
01:34:52,899 --> 01:34:56,945
I made it. It's all right.
I made it.

969
01:34:57,070 --> 01:34:59,197
Maria, will you just
think about it for a minute?

970
01:34:59,281 --> 01:35:02,450
- Listen to me.
- Who the fuck is that?

971
01:35:02,534 --> 01:35:05,620
- Okay? I couldn't tell you that I was--
- No. Put it down.

972
01:35:05,704 --> 01:35:09,457
- Don't.
- You couldn't tell her you were what?

973
01:35:13,962 --> 01:35:18,925
You couldn't tell her
you were what? Who is this guy?

974
01:35:21,052 --> 01:35:25,098
You're-- Is this the guy?

975
01:35:25,182 --> 01:35:27,058
Is this the reason?

976
01:35:30,437 --> 01:35:32,647
You wanna take a walk in
the other room, pretty please?

977
01:35:34,941 --> 01:35:37,694
Take a fuckin' walk!

978
01:35:58,131 --> 01:36:01,635
Christopher--
Christopher ''Lee-chee.''

979
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:03,887
- Lecce.
- Lee-chee.

980
01:36:06,681 --> 01:36:08,892
So, Lee-chee, what are you doin'
botherin' my old lady?

981
01:36:08,975 --> 01:36:11,186
- We had a fiight.
- Oh, you had a fiight?

982
01:36:11,269 --> 01:36:14,606
- That's too bad. What was it about?
- None of your business.

983
01:36:16,066 --> 01:36:19,819
Watch it, pal. It is all my business.
Now, what was it about?

984
01:36:19,903 --> 01:36:22,739
She found out I was
violating my parole, okay?

985
01:36:27,536 --> 01:36:30,288
Are you kidding me?

986
01:36:33,875 --> 01:36:35,836
What kind of candy-ass crime
did you commit, Chris?

987
01:36:35,961 --> 01:36:41,800
Did you steal some old lady's
handbag, huh? What'd you do?

988
01:36:41,883 --> 01:36:44,094
- Hey, take it easy. Take it easy, pal.
- What did you do?

989
01:36:44,219 --> 01:36:46,179
Don't tell me to take it easy.

990
01:36:47,806 --> 01:36:51,476
- What'd you do?
- I rob banks.

991
01:36:52,894 --> 01:36:54,938
You rob banks?

992
01:36:56,815 --> 01:36:59,734
- Could you get me a knife, honey?
- What?

993
01:36:59,818 --> 01:37:04,197
Have a seat, Christopher.
Get me a knife.

994
01:37:14,040 --> 01:37:16,960
- You do time?
- Year and a half.

995
01:37:17,043 --> 01:37:19,713
- Where?
- Walla Walla.

996
01:37:19,796 --> 01:37:22,632
Hand me the knife, honey,
would you, please?

997
01:37:26,219 --> 01:37:28,597
I said, give me the knife.

998
01:37:40,609 --> 01:37:44,738
- Do you know who I am?
- No, man, I don't know who you are.

999
01:37:47,365 --> 01:37:49,868
- I don't believe you.
- Oh! Ooh!
- No!

1000
01:37:49,993 --> 01:37:52,204
What the hell
is the matter with you?

1001
01:37:52,287 --> 01:37:55,207
I just wanted to know what
these things were stuffed with.

1002
01:38:00,295 --> 01:38:04,841
They're made of money.
She's safer than the bank, Chris.

1003
01:38:12,349 --> 01:38:15,685
I had some friends at Walla Walla.
You probably know some of'em.
You know Cletus Ink?

1004
01:38:19,773 --> 01:38:22,317
- Nope.
- You don't know Cletus Ink?

1005
01:38:22,442 --> 01:38:24,319
- Uh-uh.
- You know Mad Dog Ross?

1006
01:38:24,444 --> 01:38:28,031
- You gotta know Mad Dog.
- No, I don't, but it was a big place.

1007
01:38:30,408 --> 01:38:32,786
You don't know Cletus Ink?
You don't know Mad Dog Ross?

1008
01:38:32,911 --> 01:38:35,747
Who the hell do you know?

1009
01:38:42,671 --> 01:38:46,424
Do you know Eddie Gant? Hmm?

1010
01:38:48,969 --> 01:38:53,265
- Yeah. Yeah, I did know Eddie Gant.
- What was he in for?

1011
01:38:57,435 --> 01:38:59,813
He killed a cop.

1012
01:39:01,398 --> 01:39:03,692
Hello?

1013
01:39:03,775 --> 01:39:06,444
Yeah. Guess who this is.

1014
01:39:06,528 --> 01:39:10,282
Yeah, that's right. Well,
shut up for a second, will ya?

1015
01:39:10,365 --> 01:39:14,661
I can only say that the reports of
my demise have been greatly exaggerated.

1016
01:39:14,744 --> 01:39:18,164
Well, listen, man, I don't have time
to talk. Where we gonna do this?
We have to do it now.

1017
01:39:25,463 --> 01:39:29,509
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yeah.

1018
01:39:29,593 --> 01:39:33,013
Okay. All right. I'll
meet you there in 20 minutes.

1019
01:39:35,765 --> 01:39:38,435
Pack a bag.
We're taking a trip.

1020
01:39:41,479 --> 01:39:44,399
- What? What is it?
- There's someone out there.

1021
01:39:47,736 --> 01:39:49,946
- You! Now, get out the front door!
-Just relax, man.

1022
01:39:50,071 --> 01:39:51,781
- Get out the front door!
-Just relax! I'm not part of this shit!

1023
01:39:51,865 --> 01:39:55,035
Lock the front door
and the back. Get out.

1024
01:39:55,118 --> 01:39:57,245
Get out.

1025
01:39:57,370 --> 01:39:59,331
I will be back.

1026
01:40:06,129 --> 01:40:08,632
Oh. Oh.

1027
01:40:26,608 --> 01:40:29,528
Oh, shit!

1028
01:40:29,653 --> 01:40:31,613
Jesus Christ.

1029
01:40:45,585 --> 01:40:48,171
- What the fuck's goin' on?
- I don't know, man.

1030
01:40:48,296 --> 01:40:50,423
Take it easy. Take it easy.

1031
01:40:50,507 --> 01:40:52,551
Get him inside.

1032
01:40:52,634 --> 01:40:55,303
Throw him on the couch.

1033
01:40:59,307 --> 01:41:01,268
Cop. I knew it!

1034
01:41:06,022 --> 01:41:08,942
- What the hell are you--
- Shut up, pig!

1035
01:41:09,067 --> 01:41:11,820
Hey, back off.

1036
01:41:11,945 --> 01:41:14,531
How did you know
I was here? Hmm?

1037
01:41:14,656 --> 01:41:17,492
How did you know I was here?

1038
01:41:17,617 --> 01:41:20,704
You don't answer me. All right.
You say goodbye to your mama.

1039
01:41:22,289 --> 01:41:25,625
- Richard, don't!
- He wasn't following you.

1040
01:41:25,709 --> 01:41:28,253
He was following me.

1041
01:41:28,378 --> 01:41:31,047
- What?
- Yeah.

1042
01:41:31,131 --> 01:41:34,134
Yeah, I violated my parole, remember?
He's been following me for a week.

1043
01:41:34,259 --> 01:41:38,722
I made you on Saturday, asshole.
You don't do your job very well, do you?

1044
01:41:40,223 --> 01:41:44,102
Look, I got a car right outside. I can
drive you to wherever you wanna go.

1045
01:41:44,227 --> 01:41:46,688
Cuff his hands behind him.

1046
01:41:46,813 --> 01:41:49,816
If he gets loose, you die!

1047
01:41:49,900 --> 01:41:53,403
You may think serving time
and having a couple cops on your ass
gives me a reason to trust you.

1048
01:41:53,486 --> 01:41:58,283
Well, let me tell you something, pal.
The last people in the world
I trust are ex-cons. Let's move.

1049
01:42:06,291 --> 01:42:09,544
So, uh, wh-wha-- what's
the deal with this guy?

1050
01:42:09,669 --> 01:42:14,216
I mean, really, what is
the deal with this guy? Huh?

1051
01:42:14,299 --> 01:42:16,593
I don't even know who he is.

1052
01:42:17,761 --> 01:42:20,263
Isn't love great, Chris?

1053
01:42:20,388 --> 01:42:24,935
One minute you're a god.
Next minute you're a scum-suckin' pig.

1054
01:42:33,068 --> 01:42:35,904
I'm leavin' the country, baby.
You're goin' with me.

1055
01:42:36,029 --> 01:42:37,989
You goin' to Canada?

1056
01:42:38,114 --> 01:42:41,368
Are you a travel agent?
Drive, sucker.

1057
01:42:54,756 --> 01:42:56,716
Get out.

1058
01:43:19,823 --> 01:43:23,660
Sit down. Sit down.

1059
01:43:23,785 --> 01:43:25,912
- Hey--
- Shut up!

1060
01:43:29,749 --> 01:43:34,379
Maria, come here. I gotta talk
to this guy for about, uh, fiive minutes.

1061
01:43:34,462 --> 01:43:36,840
Could-- Could you take a walk
and just come back in fiive minutes?

1062
01:43:36,965 --> 01:43:39,426
What for?

1063
01:43:41,636 --> 01:43:44,723
-Just take a walk, would ya?
- You're going to kill them, aren't you?

1064
01:43:46,308 --> 01:43:48,018
Well, I'm not gonna
make love to them.

1065
01:43:48,101 --> 01:43:49,895
You expect me to go with you
after you do this?

1066
01:43:49,978 --> 01:43:54,107
What do you want me to do?
Let them go? Do I look stupid?

1067
01:43:54,191 --> 01:43:57,611
If I let them go, I am dead.

1068
01:43:57,694 --> 01:44:02,324
How long do you think it's gonna take
for them to pick me up if I let them go?

1069
01:44:02,407 --> 01:44:05,493
Is that what you want?
They're gonna die, not me.

1070
01:44:05,619 --> 01:44:08,538
- Why? What do you--
- Why? Because that guy's a cop!

1071
01:44:08,622 --> 01:44:12,918
And that guy has been inside you.
Now get outta my way.

1072
01:44:13,043 --> 01:44:15,795
- No.
- Maria.

1073
01:44:19,591 --> 01:44:23,178
You're not gonna stop me.

1074
01:44:23,303 --> 01:44:25,597
Maria, get outta my way.
Come here.

1075
01:44:25,722 --> 01:44:28,099
- Get your fucking hands off me!
- Maria. Get out!

1076
01:44:28,183 --> 01:44:31,603
No! Richard! No! No!
Richard! Richard! Ah!

1077
01:44:39,194 --> 01:44:43,907
- Don't you ever hit me! You understand?
- Oh, God!

1078
01:44:46,284 --> 01:44:50,038
Come on, man.
We gotta get outta here!

1079
01:44:52,958 --> 01:44:57,087
-Jesus Christ! That guy's a cop!
- I know he's a cop.

1080
01:44:57,170 --> 01:45:00,173
- His hands are cuffed.
- Not him. The other one.

1081
01:45:30,662 --> 01:45:35,458
Hey, where you goin'? Hey!
Wait for me, you bastard!

1082
01:45:55,353 --> 01:45:57,731
- No! No!
- You're drivin' me to the border!
Get up the stairs!

1083
01:45:58,940 --> 01:46:01,860
Get up the stairs.

1084
01:46:19,377 --> 01:46:22,214
You wanna shoot? Huh?

1085
01:46:22,297 --> 01:46:25,467
Go ahead, pal!
What's the matter? You chicken?

1086
01:49:16,096 --> 01:49:19,099
Whoa!

1087
01:51:16,842 --> 01:51:20,262
I hope you believe
in reincarnation, sucker!

1088
01:51:28,436 --> 01:51:30,313
Get away!

1089
01:52:21,406 --> 01:52:25,285
I was supposed to give you a call,
wasn't I? I forgot.

1090
01:52:27,787 --> 01:52:30,540
- Is he gonna be okay?
- Not if you don't keep out of the way.

1091
01:52:30,665 --> 01:52:33,502
- Hey, man. How ya doin'? Okay?
- Hi.

1092
01:52:33,585 --> 01:52:35,712
Yeah, I'm okay.
I'm just a little tired.

1093
01:52:35,795 --> 01:52:39,216
A little tired, huh? Well, listen.
You go home, you get plenty of rest.

1094
01:52:39,299 --> 01:52:43,178
'Cause when I get better,
I'm gonna break both your legs.

1095
01:52:43,303 --> 01:52:45,514
- You're dust, Lecce. You hear me? Dust.
- Yeah. I'll see ya.

1096
01:52:45,597 --> 01:52:48,350
- Not only did you hit me once,
but twice.
- I'll see ya. Hey.

1097
01:52:48,433 --> 01:52:50,477
- This is one
of the worst nights of my life.
- What do you want?

1098
01:52:50,602 --> 01:52:53,063
- Well, I just wanna know
if she's gonna be okay.
- She's okay.

1099
01:52:53,146 --> 01:52:55,690
- Okay.
- Lusk thinks you got something
going on with that girl.

1100
01:52:55,815 --> 01:52:57,609
- He wants an investigation.
- What are you talkin' about?

1101
01:52:57,734 --> 01:53:00,028
Well, he said you could
be in a lot of trouble.

1102
01:53:00,111 --> 01:53:02,864
Hell, I told him
you're always in trouble.

1103
01:53:18,964 --> 01:53:22,300
You saved my life.

1104
01:53:22,425 --> 01:53:25,178
You know what that means,
don't you?

1105
01:53:25,303 --> 01:53:28,557
No. What?

1106
01:53:28,682 --> 01:53:30,559
You belong to me now.

1107
01:53:55,500 --> 01:53:57,377
- What is your name, really?
- It's Chris.

1108
01:53:57,502 --> 01:53:59,546
- Chris? I love you, Chris.
- Really. I swear to God.

1109
01:53:59,671 --> 01:54:03,175
I say I love you
I hold you near me

1110
01:54:03,258 --> 01:54:05,719
- I love you too.
- You say I scare you

1111
01:54:05,802 --> 01:54:07,846
Well, that's your fear

1112
01:54:07,929 --> 01:54:12,475
- I know the message my heart is sending
- I'll take you home.
- Okay.

1113
01:54:12,601 --> 01:54:16,813
- If you don't read it
you'll keep on missing
- What a boner!

1114
01:54:16,897 --> 01:54:20,400
Is it love
Is it love we're after

1115
01:54:25,071 --> 01:54:29,701
Is it love, is it
Is it love

1116
01:54:32,662 --> 01:54:36,708
The broken record
goes 'round and 'round

1117
01:54:36,791 --> 01:54:40,837
Within a circle
Without a sound

1118
01:54:40,921 --> 01:54:44,883
I'm underwater
In overdrive

1119
01:54:45,008 --> 01:54:48,595
You hide in laughter
what's on your mind

1120
01:54:49,930 --> 01:54:54,392
Is it love
Is it love we're after

1121
01:54:54,518 --> 01:54:56,728
Why don't you tell me

1122
01:54:58,146 --> 01:55:03,818
Is it love, is it
Is it love, oh

1123
01:55:06,446 --> 01:55:10,909
Is it love
Is it love we're after

1124
01:55:11,034 --> 01:55:13,078
Why can't you tell me

1125
01:55:14,663 --> 01:55:18,416
Is it love
Is it really love

1126
01:55:55,954 --> 01:56:00,500
Is it love
Is it love we're after

1127
01:56:00,584 --> 01:56:03,044
Why can't you tell me

1128
01:56:04,212 --> 01:56:08,049
Is it love, is it
Is it love

1129
01:56:12,429 --> 01:56:15,265
Is it love
Is it love we're after

1130
01:56:15,348 --> 01:56:19,102
Hey, girl, well, I got to know

1131

Why don't you tell me

Everybody lookin'for the time
Thinkin'love will come around

1138
01:56:53,845 --> 01:56:56,598
