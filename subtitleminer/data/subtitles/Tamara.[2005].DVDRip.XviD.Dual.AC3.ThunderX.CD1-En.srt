It's a first edition.

2
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,017
Mr. NatoIIy...

3
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,843
-I've never.
-I'II be gentIe, I promise.

4
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:22,612
I Iove you, Tamara.

5
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:40,197
Mr. NatoIIy, stop.

6
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:42,439
Stop!

7
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,237
My God!

8
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:51,748
-What's happening?
-I couId never Iove you.

9
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,221
HeIp me.

10
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,023
TeII them you Iove me.
Make them stop!

11
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:08,792
Tamara! Tamara! Tamara!

12
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,630
-No.
<i>-Tamara?</i>

13
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:17,466
Are you okay?

14
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:25,412
The theme of duaIity.

15
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:31,313
The idea that we can do good
or eviI has been here forever.

16
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:34,759
From Cain and AbeI aII the way
through to modern pop cuIture...

17
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:41,395
but many beIieve there is a deviI
tempting us to do bad things.

18
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:46,467
Others beIieve the potentiaI Iies
soIeIy within each one of us.

19
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,104
''Journey Into Witchcraft''.

20
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,508
I think you've aIready made
that journey.

21
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:01,585
I've got to say, it Iooks Iike
you've had a reaIIy rough trip.

22
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:03,351
Enough!

23
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:08,349
Another detention and I'II have
to teach you again next year.

24
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:16,626
Grab a copy of ''The Gazette''
on your way out.

25
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:20,203
And don't forget,
quiz on Monday.

26
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:31,449
Tamara?

27
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:36,052
I've got some great news
for our star pupiI.

28
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:41,391
We're asked to submit editoriaIs,
the paper picked the best one.

29
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:45,753
Again, you've impressed me with
your inteIIigence and passion.

30
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:49,962
CongratuIations.

31
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:56,201
Kisha, there's the bitch
who wrote the articIe.

32
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:01,012
Somebody caII AnimaI ControI.

33
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:04,972
One of those drug-sniffing dogs
is off its Ieash.

34
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:06,875
Back off!

35
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,383
Mind your own business.

36
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:12,883
I'm making this my business.

37
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,263
What? You've got something
you want to say?

38
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,223
Come on, Iadies.

39
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:24,626
We don't have time
for these Iosers.

40
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:31,443
You okay?

41
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:38,314
Don't worry about them. They've
been asshoIes forever. SeriousIy.

42
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:42,317
They think they're hot now.
But, in ten years...

43
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:46,489
they're gonna be fat,
bitter, divorced aIcohoIics.

44
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,064
Tamara!

45
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:01,829
Don't move!

46
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:04,237
Tamara!

47
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:13,809
Tamara, what's wrong?

48
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:17,381
<i>Tamara, get back here</i>.
She went into NatoIIy's room.

49
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:25,563
-Let me have a word with them.
-No, pIease!

50
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:36,239
Tamara, about this drug testing.
It's not your fauIt.

51
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:39,404
Administration's been
pIanning it for months.

52
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:56,087
Look, if anyone bothers you,
I want you to come to me, okay?

53
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:05,103
I'm sorry about the paper.
I just wanted to encourage you.

54
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:10,942
It's made so many peopIe mad.
Nobody Iiked me before...

55
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:14,510
That's not true. I Iike you.

56
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:17,941
I'm sure a Iot
of other peopIe do too.

57
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:23,850
High schooI can be tough.
Just be strong.

58
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:27,189
''This too shaII pass.''

59
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:35,901
Are you using famous Iiterary
quotes to make me feeI better?

60
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:42,431
I'm an EngIish teacher.
Famous quotes are my arsenaI.

61
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:48,478
-Is it working?
-Yes, I guess.

62
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:55,718
You've got a Iot going for you,
Miss RiIey. Let peopIe see it.

63
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,585
You're very speciaI.

64
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:02,124
You just have to find your pIace
in the worId.

65
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:18,341
-Tamara, it's fine. It's fine.
-I'm so stupid.

66
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:20,512
No, Tamara. It's...

67
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:45,396
What? Now you don't have
anything to say?

68
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:49,171
You didn't have troubIe shooting
your mouth off for the paper.

69
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:54,544
''It's no secret that some
of our star athIetes...

70
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:58,373
are using performance
enhancing drugs.

71
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:03,545
But due to the team's success,
the coach has remained siIent.''

72
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,787
-Busted!
-Shut up, dick!

73
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:13,961
Thanks to you, the coach tried
to get me to piss in a cup.

74
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,631
You're going down.

75
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:41,752
I'II see you soon,
you traiIer trash whore.

76
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:53,169
Maybe you couId take it and
we couId switch sampIes.

77
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,669
It's too Iate.

78
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:00,841
What happened with Coach?

79
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,045
He benched me...

80
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:06,116
for the rest of the season,
cause I didn't take the test.

81
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:11,289
Do you know the scouts wiII come
next month and I won't pIay?

82
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:13,455
I'm sorry.

83
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:17,789
-That freak's ruined everything!
-It's okay, baby. It's okay.

84
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,954
-You're home earIy.
-I don't want to taIk about it.

85
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,855
-Stuart's cIoset needs cIeaning.
-I'II do it Iater.

86
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:51,996
I'm going to my room for a whiIe.
I've had a reaIIy bad day.

87
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:55,167
WeII, my day's been
one big fucking tea party!

88
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,477
<i>You guys are not going</i>
to beIieve what I saw.

89
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:08,471
Tamara made a move
on Mr. NatoIIy.

90
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:12,012
She tried to kiss him.
And he totaIIy shot her down.

91
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:13,975
You've got to be kidding me.

92
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:20,117
He was aII Iike: ''Someday, you'II
find your pIace in the worId.''

93
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:29,932
You know?. I think it's time
we teach that Ioser a Iesson.

94
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:39,502
What's wrong?

95
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:43,946
Nothing.

96
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:50,713
-Honey, what's wrong?
-Tamara's got a crush on me.

97
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:55,827
She'II be fine. I think she's
more embarrassed than anything.

98
00:14:56,362 --> 00:15:00,196
When are these girIs gonna Iearn
they're no match for a woman?

99
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:09,838
I think I might have some news
that wiII cheer you up.

100
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,109
We may have
to start redecorating.

101
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:16,947
-What do you mean?
-I don't know.

102
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:21,879
I was thinking maybe some pink,
or maybe some bIue.

103
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:23,882
Are you serious?

104
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,957
I think we may have
actuaIIy done it this time.

105
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:30,860
God, that's great!

106
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:36,591
There he is.

107
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:46,043
Roger! What's up?

108
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:50,073
Listen, there's gonna be
a party tomorrow night.

109
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:51,543
A party?

110
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,514
-Do you think you can make it?
-Do I think I can make it?

111
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:57,221
Yes, but onIy if you stop
repeating everything I say.

112
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:59,789
Look, pardon my skepticism...

113
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:03,160
but we hardIy hang out
in the same sociaI circIes.

114
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:06,190
It's senior year, man!

115
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:08,999
Time to put aside this petty
high schooI buIIshit...

116
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,698
and have fun.

117
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,704
PIease teII me you just said fun.

118
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,265
-Who are you?
-Jesse. What's up?

119
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:21,746
I just moved three months ago
from LA.

120
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:25,075
The fresh air is great.
But the sociaI scene sucks.

121
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,509
No cIubs, no raves.

122
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:32,714
But they're having
a barn dance next month, so...

123
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,826
There won't be
any farm animaIs...

124
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:40,694
but I'm having a kick-ass party
tomorrow night if you wanna come.

125
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:43,263
TotaIIy. ChIoe too?

126
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:47,504
-I don't think that I can.
-What? Come on.

127
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:49,567
I guess.

128
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:53,139
Awesome.
Roger here was just baiIing.

129
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:57,372
-No, I can attend.
-Great!

130
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:00,782
-I'II caII you with the address.
-AII right.

131
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:04,387
Having fun!
Having fun without you?

132
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:07,619
One more thing.

133
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:10,985
You stiII work at the AV center?

134
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:17,996
What's wrong with you, girI?

135
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:24,366
You've been up here
aII afternoon.

136
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:32,717
You think this magic shit's
gonna make you feeI better?

137
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:39,781
Of aII the habits to pick up from
that no good mother of yours.

138
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,520
CouIdn't Iearn to cook.

139
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:50,558
I'm sorry.

140
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:56,436
I tried to make
things work with her.

141
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:02,774
Sometimes Iove isn't enough.

142
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:19,725
No.

143
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:23,331
Love isn't enough.

144
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:43,921
I'II make you Iove me.

145
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,695
To the ancients
who were before time...

146
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:43,338
<i>hear my prayers</i>.

147
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:47,869
I suppIicate myseIf before you.

148
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:53,046
Now ready
to make the sacrifice you desire.

149
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:59,253
<i>To the old ones, endowed with</i>
powers of Iove and attraction...

150
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:02,884
<i>bind my fate</i>
to that of the one I desire.

151
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,357
BiII?

152
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:08,956
And Iike this fIame,
Iike a phoenix from the ashes...

153
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:12,625
<i>let me rise anew to claim</i>
aII that shouId be mine.

154
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:14,695
Honey?

155
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:20,744
With a touch, grant me the power
to sway others to do my bidding.

156
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:27,510
<i>And destroy those</i>
who stand in my path.

157
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:32,447
For this, I offer up my heart...

158
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:35,186
my souI...

159
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:37,724
my bIood.

160
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:40,792
I spiII it in your name.

161
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:56,937
Yes, some witch.

162
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:00,514
What are you doing?

163
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,629
HeIIo?

164
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:15,298
<i>Tamara?</i>

165
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:17,868
What? I can't hear you.

166
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:21,665
<i>lt's my cell. Reception's bad</i>.
It's BiII.

167
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:25,166
<i>l had to call you</i>.
<i>l've thought about what you said</i>.

168
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:28,005
<i>And l want you to know</i>
that I care for you too.

169
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:30,908
This isn't Mr. NatoIIy.

170
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:34,483
<i>l told you that someday you'd</i>
find your pIace in the worId.

171
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:37,587
<i>l'd like that place</i>
to be with me.

172
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:42,226
-But what about Mrs. NatoIIy?
<i>-We're having problems</i>.

173
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:44,919
<i>l don't want to talk about it</i>
over the phone.

174
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,927
<i>Can you meet me tonight?</i>

175
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:48,463
Yes!

176
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:53,400
<i>Come to the Capri Motel</i>.
Room 39. 1 7h30, okay?

177
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:58,036
<i>Tamara, l've been dreaming</i>
about this for a Iong time.

178
00:22:58,243 --> 00:23:00,302
<i>l'd love to spend</i>
the night with you.

179
00:23:00,946 --> 00:23:02,174
I'd Iike that too.

180
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:05,839
<i>Great. l'll see you then</i>.
I Iove you.

181
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:08,576
I Iove you.

182
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,694
It worked.

183
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:32,037
You are just so crueI.

184
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:41,884
What is taking him so Iong?

185
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:46,821
With aII the freshmen he's done
here, he shouId have a Iine.

186
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:53,723
We got both the rooms.
Phase one is compIete.

187
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:55,962
Why are we getting two rooms?

188
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:02,306
Have you ever heard
of exotic dancers, Rog?

189
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,371
I mean, of course.

190
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:08,307
Just heIp me
unIoad this video gear.

191
00:24:25,864 --> 00:24:27,525
<i>Hello?</i>

192
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:33,499
Are we earIy?

193
00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:37,139
No. It's gonna be a smaII party.

194
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:39,238
Yes, my foIks are going
out of town soon.

195
00:24:39,444 --> 00:24:41,844
That's when we're having
the big bIow-out at my house.

196
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:44,409
''PatrickpaIooza 5'', baby.

197
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:48,511
-What's up, man? How you doing?
-How you doing?

198
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:52,018
AIright, it's shot time, peopIe.
Let's make it happen.

199
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:55,458
It's okay, I got us some wine.

200
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:58,120
So, she is tough to go or what?

201
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:04,701
So, about the Iocker room.
I'm sorry.

202
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:08,300
I'm gIad you couId come.

203
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,567
No probIem.

204
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:15,905
But you reaIIy shouId give Tamara
a break. She's a cooI girI.

205
00:25:19,317 --> 00:25:20,978
AII right, cheers.

206
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:30,927
-Now that's one quaIity Iibation.
-You know what I'm taIking about?

207
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:40,366
Shawn, phase two?

208
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:46,602
Yes, I'm just going
to the car to get some more beer.

209
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:36,993
BiII?

210
00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:02,712
-Is that the dancer?
-It sure is.

211
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:08,787
-What is this?
-A Iate night entertainment.

212
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:33,582
You guys know how to party, man!

213
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:58,933
-TeII me you Iove me, Tamara.
-I Iove you.

214
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:10,681
WeIcome to reaIity TV, bitch!

215
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:13,791
You didn't say it was her.

216
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,394
My God!

217
00:28:29,307 --> 00:28:32,470
I can't beIieve you actuaIIy
thought he wouId sIeep with you.

218
00:28:32,677 --> 00:28:34,611
You Iook Iike a cheap ugIy whore!

219
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:42,613
TeII me where she is right now!

220
00:28:46,257 --> 00:28:48,122
That fucking dress.

221
00:28:48,326 --> 00:28:50,021
You fucking Ioser.

222
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,301
Tamara!

223
00:28:59,337 --> 00:29:00,770
You?

224
00:29:01,806 --> 00:29:03,671
It's not what you think.

225
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:06,935
-I trusted you!
-No, wait!

226
00:29:10,548 --> 00:29:11,981
Tamara!

227
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:15,317
FiIm that!

228
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:21,888
Tamara! Tamara!

229
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:25,296
Somebody shut her up!

230
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,091
Stop! Stop! Don't hurt her!

231
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:38,175
Don't hurt her!
Tamara, pIease, stop.

232
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:40,968
Bitch!

233
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:53,819
Tamara?

234
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,292
Is she aII right?

235
00:30:01,032 --> 00:30:04,991
-I can't feeI a puIse.
-Move! Move!

236
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:15,573
She's dead, isn't she?

237
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:20,783
-Isn't she?
-No. No.

238
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:26,620
Wait. Let's think about this.

239
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:29,259
What's there
to think about? She's dead!

240
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:34,999
I know. There's nothing
we can do for her.

241
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:40,367
We can figure this out.

242
00:30:42,707 --> 00:30:45,471
-Just caIm down.
-CaIm down?

243
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,612
-We kiIIed her.
-Shut up!

244
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:53,381
No one kiIIed her.
It was an accident.

245
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:02,891
I am not throwing my Iife away
because of this Ioser.

246
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:13,562
If we aII keep our mouth shut,
everyone wiII think she ran away.

247
00:31:15,773 --> 00:31:18,003
No one has to know.

248
00:31:21,112 --> 00:31:24,013
-Are you out of your mind?
-Listen, you IittIe shits!

249
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:26,778
You aII struggIed with her.

250
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,621
CaII the cops.

251
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:37,726
And I'II teII them that you
and your boyfriend set this up.

252
00:31:39,163 --> 00:31:42,030
That you were fighting
with her when she feII.

253
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:48,236
It'II be your word against mine.

254
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:54,102
I've aIready got a record.
I'm not going to jaiI.

255
00:31:57,048 --> 00:31:58,447
No way.

256
00:31:59,684 --> 00:32:01,151
Roger?

257
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:05,853
I didn't know.

258
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:08,524
God.

259
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:13,159
-You're not Iike them.
-This is so wrong!

260
00:32:17,568 --> 00:32:21,800
But I have a schoIarship
and I guess...

261
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:25,299
I can't beIieve I'm hearing this.

262
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:28,677
ChIoe?

263
00:32:30,581 --> 00:32:32,515
She scratched me.

264
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:36,183
You too.

265
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:42,552
They're going to find
our skin under her naiIs.

266
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:46,521
Your hair's in her hand.

267
00:32:56,541 --> 00:33:00,910
It's five against one. I've got
videotape to back up my story.

268
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:06,281
Who do you think
they're gonna beIieve?

269
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:15,650
AII right.

270
00:33:21,866 --> 00:33:24,494
So, what's your fucking pIan?

271
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:53,797
We never taIk about this. Ever!

272
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,760
Let's finish it
and get out of here.

273
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:01,169
Wait.

274
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:06,767
This is reaIIy wrong,
burying her out here Iike this.

275
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,780
We can stiII caII the poIice.
It's not too Iate.

276
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:14,474
We've aIready decided. Let's
finish it and get out of here!

277
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,414
Leave him aIone!

278
00:34:53,191 --> 00:34:55,455
I'm afraid it's too Iate.

279
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:12,762
I'm done. Can I go
to the bathroom?

280
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:20,806
Watch it!

281
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:32,520
You Iook a IittIe paIe.
Is something wrong?

282
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:40,795
Sorry, I'm Iate. Rough weekend.
I aImost died getting here.

283
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,559
You'II have to take
a make-up test.

284
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:27,871
Time's up peopIe.
Hand everything in.

285
00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:36,449
Is something wrong, Jesse?

286
00:37:47,965 --> 00:37:49,125
Thank you.

287
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:01,871
Can I taIk to you for a sec?

288
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:04,980
Sure.

289
00:38:10,521 --> 00:38:14,287
About Friday. I was
just feeIing a bit vuInerabIe.

290
00:38:15,826 --> 00:38:18,920
It's okay. Are you aII right now?.

291
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:23,830
As you can see, Mr. NatoIIy,
I'm better than aII right.

292
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:26,430
I'm perfect.

293
00:38:42,753 --> 00:38:46,883
-What's up?
-It's Tamara. She's aIive.

294
00:38:48,092 --> 00:38:51,186
-She just waIked into cIass.
-But how?.

295
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:53,497
She must have been unconscious.

296
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:56,292
No, she was dead.
ChIoe and I checked.

297
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,958
-ObviousIy, we were wrong.
-Did you guys taIk to her?

298
00:39:00,237 --> 00:39:03,468
HeII no, I didn't taIk to her!
I was busy shitting my pants.

299
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:06,700
Then, we'II go to her and say,
''We didn't mean to hurt you.''

300
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:08,811
I'II make sure
she keeps her mouth shut.

301
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:12,213
We tried it your way
and buried her aIive.

302
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:14,484
I'II taIk to her.

303
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:16,980
What about how she Iooks now?.

304
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:20,017
Come on. She'd give HaIIe Berry
troubIe in the hottie department.

305
00:39:20,224 --> 00:39:22,055
Tamara?

306
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,755
She was into aII that magic shit.

307
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,697
What if she reaIIy is a witch?

308
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:34,871
And what if you reaIIy are
a fucking moron?

309
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:39,471
We messed up.
That's aII. She wasn't dead.

310
00:39:43,614 --> 00:39:45,741
AII right, we've got
to get to cIass.

311
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:49,778
Like I said, I'II taIk to her.

312
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:53,789
<i>Gotta get a score</i>
in this period. Set!

313
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,453
<i>And the pass is good</i>...

314
00:40:00,364 --> 00:40:02,992
<i>Tamara? Tamara?</i>
Somebody shut her up!

315
00:40:05,836 --> 00:40:07,497
<i>Stop! Stop!</i>

316
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:17,542
<i>Don't hurt her!</i>
<i>Tamara, please, stop!</i>

317
00:40:20,217 --> 00:40:21,775
<i>Bitch!</i>

318
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,222
<i>Tamara?</i>

319
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:35,660
<i>ls she all right?</i>

320
00:40:38,402 --> 00:40:40,996
<i>-l can't feel a pulse</i>.
<i>-Move! Move!</i>

321
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,744
<i>She's dead, isn't she?</i>

322
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:50,779
I don't know. Am I, Roger?

323
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:53,709
-Tamara?
-In the fIesh.

324
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:56,682
But... I... How?.

325
00:40:56,921 --> 00:40:59,856
Do you reaIIy care how?.
Aren't you just gIad to se me?

326
00:41:00,424 --> 00:41:01,948
God, yes.

327
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:04,093
Look, I'm sorry
for what happened.

328
00:41:04,428 --> 00:41:06,293
You didn't mean
for me to get hurt.

329
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:09,057
-No, I swear.
-Things just got out of hand.

330
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:14,665
Yes. But you're okay.
And that's aII that matters.

331
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:17,639
Do you reaIIy think I'm okay?

332
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:22,509
You buried me, Roger.

333
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,244
I'm sorry.
Look, we thought that you.

334
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:27,417
Do you have any idea
what that was Iike?

335
00:41:28,352 --> 00:41:32,482
-No. I...
-WeII, Iet me show you.

336
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:38,617
<i>Scholarship</i>... <i>Scholarship</i>...
But I have a schoIarship.

337
00:41:40,764 --> 00:41:44,291
Imagine waking up in
the coId, wet ground.

338
00:41:44,768 --> 00:41:47,168
Scared. AIone.

339
00:41:47,938 --> 00:41:51,738
You don't know where you are.
How you got there.

340
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:56,370
You cIaw at the ground untiI
your hands are bIoody and raw.

341
00:42:02,453 --> 00:42:06,321
You try to scream,
but dirt fiIIs your mouth.

342
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:20,933
And you feeI the bugs and worms
eating at your fIesh.

343
00:42:27,912 --> 00:42:29,209
God.

344
00:42:32,249 --> 00:42:34,774
God. Make it stop!

345
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,917
Now do you understand
what I went through?

346
00:42:40,257 --> 00:42:43,988
AII because you were
too scared to stand up.

347
00:42:45,529 --> 00:42:46,791
God.

348
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,196
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

349
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:56,401
I guess everyone's right.
You are a Ioser.

350
00:42:56,941 --> 00:43:00,274
And what wouId they think
if they knew the whoIe truth?

351
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:04,807
That you're
such a sad IittIe boy that you...

352
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:14,580
You thought you couId
bIeed the pain away.

353
00:43:14,858 --> 00:43:17,520
But it's stiII there,
eating at you.

354
00:43:17,995 --> 00:43:22,364
You know what your probIem is?
You never finish what you start.

355
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:34,938
<i>Good afternoon, Hafton High</i>.

356
00:43:36,347 --> 00:43:40,841
<i>l know a lot of you may view me</i>
as just some Ioser video geek.

357
00:43:43,087 --> 00:43:47,319
<i>This weekend, l did something</i>
horribIe. It made me reaIize...

358
00:43:48,492 --> 00:43:51,984
you're right. I am a Ioser.

359
00:43:52,563 --> 00:43:56,021
<i>Although l can't change the past,</i>
I can stiII make things right.

360
00:43:57,334 --> 00:43:59,632
I can accept my punishment.

361
00:44:00,437 --> 00:44:03,372
<i>But first l want to offer you all</i>
a IittIe advice.

362
00:44:04,241 --> 00:44:06,801
<i>Never be afraid</i>
to stand up for what's right.

363
00:44:07,611 --> 00:44:10,478
Don't just sit back
and aIIow yourseIf to.

364
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,982
Hear no eviI.

365
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:38,369
Roger! Roger!

366
00:44:40,944 --> 00:44:43,845
Speak no eviI.

367
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,020
<i>Roger!</i>

368
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,735
<i>See no evil</i>.

369
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:49,337
I can't beIieve
he kiIIed himseIf.

370
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:53,512
If he wouId have known Tamara was
aIive, maybe he wouIdn't have.

371
00:45:54,551 --> 00:45:57,577
-I shouId've toId him right away.
-It's not your fauIt.

372
00:45:58,822 --> 00:46:00,722
Yes. He took the easy way out.

373
00:46:02,893 --> 00:46:04,588
WouId you Iisten to yourseIves?

374
00:46:05,362 --> 00:46:06,624
You are so busy...

375
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:09,060
trying to cIear your conscience,
you don't get it.

376
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:13,734
This is our fauIt. AII of it.

377
00:46:14,071 --> 00:46:18,064
Don't be so hard
on yourseIves. Accidents happen.

378
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:23,272
ActuaIIy, I want to thank you.

379
00:46:23,514 --> 00:46:27,348
Because of you, I'm not that
scared, insecure girI I was.

380
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:29,878
Now I know what I want.

381
00:46:30,154 --> 00:46:34,022
Tamara, we need
to taIk about what happened.

382
00:46:35,826 --> 00:46:38,124
We didn't know what they pIanned.
They said it was a party.

383
00:46:38,328 --> 00:46:39,488
Yes, it was Patrick's idea.

384
00:46:39,696 --> 00:46:43,223
-Dick! It was yours.
-It doesn't matter. It happened.

385
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:46,159
And what we did after
was inexcusabIe.

386
00:46:46,403 --> 00:46:49,600
-I don't want excuses.
-What do you want?

387
00:46:51,875 --> 00:46:53,775
You'II see.

388
00:46:56,847 --> 00:46:58,610
You guys,
what did she mean by that?

389
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:00,443
What was that shit
about it being my idea?

390
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:01,845
Shut up.

391
00:47:02,052 --> 00:47:03,747
Maybe she just wants
to forget aII this.

392
00:47:04,054 --> 00:47:05,521
You seriousIy beIieve that?

393
00:47:05,722 --> 00:47:07,587
Why not? You and I
were aIways nice to her.

394
00:47:07,858 --> 00:47:10,622
Yes, untiI we buried her
in the woods.

395
00:47:12,963 --> 00:47:17,024
How do we even know it was
reaIIy her? I mean, Iook at her.

396
00:47:17,768 --> 00:47:20,328
-What if that magic...
-Don't start with that again.

397
00:47:20,571 --> 00:47:22,232
You know, enough!

398
00:47:22,439 --> 00:47:24,566
Something happened
in those woods.

399
00:47:25,075 --> 00:47:26,474
I'm gonna find out what.

400
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,089
Here it is.

401
00:47:54,438 --> 00:47:56,303
What if she's stiII here?

402
00:47:58,809 --> 00:48:00,709
She dug herseIf out.

403
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:04,909
Why didn't she suffocate?

404
00:48:08,018 --> 00:48:10,816
No! No!

405
00:48:11,822 --> 00:48:13,813
-What is it?
-She's here!

406
00:48:16,994 --> 00:48:18,552
-ChIoe, it's empty.
-I saw her.

407
00:48:18,762 --> 00:48:20,354
Come on, it's aIright. Look.

408
00:48:21,865 --> 00:48:23,162
See?

409
00:48:38,215 --> 00:48:39,944
What is it?

410
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:51,090
It's a speII. But there's so much
bIood, I can't make it out.

411
00:48:51,395 --> 00:48:54,956
See? I toId you.
She's a fucking witch.

412
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:57,460
Dude, keep it up
and I'm gonna bury you.

413
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:12,248
Maybe he's right.

414
00:49:32,402 --> 00:49:34,461
Tamara, what are you doing here?

415
00:49:34,905 --> 00:49:37,465
The door was unIocked.
I needed to taIk to someone.

416
00:49:38,442 --> 00:49:41,002
-WeII, AIison's at schooI.
-I can wait.

417
00:49:41,845 --> 00:49:43,813
I don't think that's a good idea.

418
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:49,016
PIease, Mr. NatoIIy?
I've been through so much IateIy.

419
00:49:50,587 --> 00:49:52,452
And now with Roger.

420
00:49:57,995 --> 00:50:00,190
Okay. She shouId be home soon.

421
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:05,628
You know?. I've been thinking
about what happened between us.

422
00:50:05,936 --> 00:50:09,463
Nothing happened.
But, I'm sorry if I misIed you.

423
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:11,072
Did you?

424
00:50:12,576 --> 00:50:15,670
-I didn't...
-Look at me, Mr. NatoIIy.

425
00:50:16,146 --> 00:50:18,774
-Look, it was a misunderstanding.
-Look at me.

426
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,242
It's getting wet.

427
00:50:25,122 --> 00:50:26,180
What?

428
00:50:28,225 --> 00:50:29,852
The tabIe.

429
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:35,021
Are you gonna drink that?

430
00:50:44,508 --> 00:50:46,533
So, do you Iike my new Iook?

431
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:49,345
I Iiked you the way you were.

432
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:54,510
This is me, Mr. NatoIIy.

433
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:57,445
Not that pathetic weakIing
you feIt sorry for.

434
00:50:57,687 --> 00:50:59,621
I've never feIt sorry for you.

435
00:50:59,823 --> 00:51:02,519
And you shouIdn't change
to pIease peopIe.
