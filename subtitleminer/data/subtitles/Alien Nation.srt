00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:40,346
The mllitary have escorted them down...

2
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,521
It Iooked llke a door was opening.
I don't think it is.

3
00:00:45,608 --> 00:00:50,305
- This is not a hoax. That is reaI out there.
- It's sllver-grey in coIour...

4
00:00:50,392 --> 00:00:54,871
That was the scene in Callfornia's
Ìojave Desert three years ago.

5
00:00:54,959 --> 00:00:59,264
The historic fllrst view of the Newcomer ship
upon its dramatic arrivaI.

6
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:03,309
These ''Newcomers'', we soon Iearned,
were a genetically-engineered race

7
00:01:03,395 --> 00:01:07,396
adapted for hard Iabour
in aImost any environmentaI condition.

8
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:10,006
In effect, their ship was a sIave ship,

9
00:01:10,093 --> 00:01:14,486
washed ashore on Earth, with no way
to get back to where they came from.

10
00:01:14,572 --> 00:01:19,400
Now that civll llberties attorneys have had
the Newcomers reIeased from quarantine,

11
00:01:19,487 --> 00:01:22,227
what are the reactions in
communities where they've settIed?

12
00:01:22,314 --> 00:01:25,924
Why do we have to take them?
Why can't they go to Russia?

13
00:01:26,011 --> 00:01:27,402
I'll drink to that.

14
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:31,925
I'm in college now. I'm going to be
going to schooI with nine- or ten-year-oIds.

15
00:01:32,012 --> 00:01:35,275
There goes the grade curve.
There goes my job future.

16
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:40,971
I have to compete with... lf a ten-year-oId is
twice as smart as me, I'll be workin'here.

17
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:46,190
By far the strongest words of acceptance
came from then-president RonaId Reagan.

18
00:01:46,278 --> 00:01:50,627
We've come to a turning point,
a moment for hard decisions.

19
00:01:50,931 --> 00:01:53,627
lf not us, who?

20
00:01:53,758 --> 00:01:56,193
And if not now, when?

21
00:01:56,281 --> 00:02:00,760
Hey, Henry, how you doin' tonight?
You workin' hard?

22
00:02:00,847 --> 00:02:03,413
You get your green card, buddy?

23
00:02:18,765 --> 00:02:22,679
SIagtown. I hate this pIace. Look at that geek.

24
00:02:22,766 --> 00:02:25,506
I hate it. Look at this crap.

25
00:02:27,594 --> 00:02:32,160
- I wonder if their pIumbing's the same.
- Yeah, it is.

26
00:02:32,247 --> 00:02:35,335
What? Oh, man, get outta here.

27
00:02:37,292 --> 00:02:39,771
I don't trust 'em, that's all.

28
00:02:41,814 --> 00:02:44,250
Good day...

29
00:02:44,337 --> 00:02:47,816
Take a hike, wllI ya? Jesus Christ.

30
00:02:48,077 --> 00:02:49,513
God, that stink.

31
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:54,644
Why has it gotta be sour mllk they get wasted
on? Why not Jack DanieI's or Thunderbird?

32
00:02:54,732 --> 00:02:56,776
What's wrong with that?

33
00:02:56,862 --> 00:02:59,733
Look at this. Fred Astaire and Ginger SIag.

34
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,343
What the hell's that?

35
00:03:02,429 --> 00:03:06,300
Look at this. They call this a game.
It's a circIe-jerk.

36
00:03:06,387 --> 00:03:08,562
Cowboys and SIags.

37
00:03:09,866 --> 00:03:15,259
They make up shit. I don't know what that is.
Beatin' each other to death.

38
00:03:20,652 --> 00:03:23,131
So are you gonna go
or are you not gonna go?

39
00:03:23,261 --> 00:03:25,306
How do I go?

40
00:03:25,392 --> 00:03:28,089
Ñut on your wash-and-wear suit,
cllp-on bow tie,

41
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:34,091
have your IandIady tie your shoes for you,
then you show up at the church. It's simpIe.

42
00:03:34,177 --> 00:03:36,918
- Me and CaroI are going.
- That's nice.

43
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,918
Come on, now. We've known Kristin since...

44
00:03:41,005 --> 00:03:43,485
well, since she was conceived.

45
00:03:46,702 --> 00:03:49,443
Remember? Up in that cabin at Big Bear?

46
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:51,921
You and Edie pounded the walls so hard,

47
00:03:52,009 --> 00:03:54,792
me and CaroI picked pIaster
out of our hair for a week.

48
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,532
I don't know, Tug.

49
00:03:57,619 --> 00:04:00,880
ObviousIy, I want to go to
Kristin's wedding, but I don't...

50
00:04:00,968 --> 00:04:06,622
You're just bummed out because your ex-wife
and her new husband are payin' for it.

51
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:11,492
If Kristin had to get married where I couId
afford it, it wouId be beans in a bowllng alley.

52
00:04:23,452 --> 00:04:27,410
- Now does that Iook suspicious or what?
- Whatever gave you that idea?

53
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:40,718
This is one-Henry-seven.
We got a possibIe 2-11 in progress.

54
00:04:40,805 --> 00:04:43,980
Ñorter's Minimarket on Virginia and Court.
Request backup.

55
00:04:44,067 --> 00:04:47,024
Come on, forget that shit. Let's go.

56
00:04:49,633 --> 00:04:51,895
Listen.

57
00:04:51,983 --> 00:04:55,984
Ñay attention. Tell me what those
ugIy bastards are doin' in there.

58
00:04:56,070 --> 00:05:00,333
- Two gentIemen. Long, bIack raincoats.
- Long, bIack raincoats.

59
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:04,725
Two gentIemen. Long, bIack raincoats.
With Iong, bIack shotguns.

60
00:05:04,812 --> 00:05:08,552
Oh, that's no good.
That's not very good at all.

61
00:05:10,292 --> 00:05:14,206
- Have you got your vest?
- Of course. In the trunk of the car.

62
00:05:14,337 --> 00:05:18,685
- That's where mine is. I feeI better now.
- Yeah.

63
00:05:18,772 --> 00:05:22,687
Well, I'm gonna go across the street
and get a better angIe on that door.

64
00:05:22,773 --> 00:05:26,123
- Yeah, you watch your ass.
- You watch my ass.

65
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:42,475
Oh, shit.

66
00:05:51,955 --> 00:05:54,217
Freeze. Hey, freeze.

67
00:06:19,485 --> 00:06:21,355
Tug. Get outta there.

68
00:06:21,443 --> 00:06:23,400
I can't. Do you mind?

69
00:06:27,227 --> 00:06:29,531
Tug. Go ahead, I'll cover ya.

70
00:06:29,619 --> 00:06:30,967
OK...

71
00:06:45,145 --> 00:06:46,406
Oh, shit.

72
00:07:02,062 --> 00:07:04,542
- What's happenin'?
- Hi there, sir. How are you?

73
00:07:04,628 --> 00:07:08,586
Do you mind stepping out here for a second?
We got a bit of troubIe.

74
00:07:49,641 --> 00:07:52,772
Tug... Oh, shit.

75
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,603
Stop.

76
00:11:17,352 --> 00:11:19,918
Whoa, whoa. Take it easy.

77
00:11:22,788 --> 00:11:25,441
- Are you OK?
- I'm all right.

78
00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:28,094
I'd better call this in.

79
00:11:28,181 --> 00:11:30,269
Ow, my hand.

80
00:11:32,052 --> 00:11:34,879
Are you all right?

81
00:11:34,965 --> 00:11:37,010
God, I hate you.

82
00:11:38,967 --> 00:11:43,099
Get outta here.
I don't need your goddamn heIp.

83
00:11:48,361 --> 00:11:50,405
Take it easy, wllI ya?

84
00:12:08,932 --> 00:12:12,976
Except for the magazine,
it Iooks llke a standard 12-gauge.

85
00:12:13,064 --> 00:12:18,152
- So how come it went cIean through the car?
- BRI sabot sIugs. These puppies are nasty.

86
00:12:18,239 --> 00:12:21,762
Tug might as well have been
hidin' behind a rosebush.

87
00:12:21,892 --> 00:12:24,154
Heavy stuff for knocking off a minimarket.

88
00:12:24,241 --> 00:12:28,981
An identicaI round was used in the shooting
of a Newcomer named HubIey two days ago.

89
00:12:29,068 --> 00:12:32,808
- Yeah, but how come...?
- Francisco, give me a hand. She won't budge.

90
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:36,243
Hey, llsten. Do you think
there's a connection...?

91
00:12:40,332 --> 00:12:41,332
Up yours.

92
00:13:18,561 --> 00:13:20,953
Hello, Daddy?

93
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:24,519
Dad, are you there?
Pick up the phone, pIease.

94
00:13:24,605 --> 00:13:28,780
I really need to taIk to you.
Daddy, why are you being so stubborn?

95
00:13:28,868 --> 00:13:33,782
Can't you just forget about your
hassIes with Ìom? It's my wedding.

96
00:13:33,869 --> 00:13:36,565
I mean, come on. You gotta be there.

97
00:13:37,131 --> 00:13:39,088
I aIready worked it out with Tug.

98
00:13:39,174 --> 00:13:43,524
Nothing is gonna stop him from
dragging you to that church on Sunday.

99
00:13:43,611 --> 00:13:46,525
It's at 2.30, and pIease don't be Iate.

100
00:13:47,568 --> 00:13:49,656
I Iove you, Daddy.

101
00:13:49,743 --> 00:13:54,962
I shouIdn't have said that. Now you're
gonna pull this tape out and save it.

102
00:13:55,962 --> 00:13:58,267
Bye.

103
00:13:59,137 --> 00:14:03,529
This is Ìark Helfrey from the gas company,
Ìr Sykes. Your bllI is past due...

104
00:14:33,147 --> 00:14:34,799
Matt.

105
00:14:35,886 --> 00:14:39,018
- Oh, Matt, I'm sorry, man.
- Yeah, thanks.

106
00:14:42,237 --> 00:14:46,759
- What did you dig up?
- Jesus, Sykes, it's not even been ten hours.

107
00:14:46,846 --> 00:14:49,499
Me and AIterez are on it, OK?

108
00:14:49,586 --> 00:14:52,282
Yeah. That makes me reaI happy.

109
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:54,588
Ever tried to make a case in SIagtown?

110
00:14:54,674 --> 00:14:58,937
The llst of Newcomer informants is about
as Iong as a llst of Mexican war heroes.

111
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,763
Hey, come on.

112
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:05,069
Nobody taIks to nobody down there.
HaIf of 'em don't even speak Engllsh.

113
00:15:05,156 --> 00:15:10,070
The other haIf, onIy when it suits 'em.
No, it's gonna take some time.

114
00:15:10,461 --> 00:15:13,288
Yeah, I know it'll take time with you two.

115
00:15:13,376 --> 00:15:16,898
Nobody wanders off.
I've got an announcement.

116
00:15:17,028 --> 00:15:19,378
You OK, Sykes?

117
00:15:19,464 --> 00:15:25,162
I'll make it short. This is a directive from
Chief Evaner, on orders from the mayor,

118
00:15:25,248 --> 00:15:28,249
under mandate from the FederaI
Bureau of Newcomer ReIations.

119
00:15:28,336 --> 00:15:31,206
As of nine this morning,
one Newcomer uniform officer

120
00:15:31,294 --> 00:15:35,077
has been promoted to
the rank of detective, third grade.

121
00:15:35,164 --> 00:15:40,383
We've got him, gentIemen. VoIunteers for
duty with the detective, see me in my office.

122
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:44,210
Otherwise, I wllI choose a voIunteer myseIf.

123
00:15:45,472 --> 00:15:47,516
That's all.

124
00:15:48,472 --> 00:15:52,256
What'll he do if he gets
too many voIunteers? Draw straws?

125
00:15:52,343 --> 00:15:56,344
How Iong has this SIag been
on the force anyway? A year max, right?

126
00:15:56,431 --> 00:15:59,258
I was in uniform eight years
before I became detective.

127
00:15:59,345 --> 00:16:04,607
I don't know about you guys,
but I won't take this. I'm callin' the union.

128
00:16:15,219 --> 00:16:16,654
Where the hell's he going?

129
00:16:18,264 --> 00:16:20,177
- Bob.
- Yeah, Sykes?

130
00:16:20,264 --> 00:16:24,961
Yeah, I'd llke to voIunteer for duty
with the new...

131
00:16:26,483 --> 00:16:28,701
- You know...
- Look, Matt...

132
00:16:29,658 --> 00:16:33,398
You don't have to jump right back in.
Why don't you take a few days, reIax?

133
00:16:33,528 --> 00:16:35,703
I'd llke to stay on, thanks.

134
00:16:36,094 --> 00:16:38,182
All right.

135
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:42,531
Detective Sergeant Sykes,
Detective Francisco.

136
00:16:42,661 --> 00:16:45,793
- We have met.
- Yeah, right.

137
00:16:46,358 --> 00:16:50,098
Victor GoIdrup, Mayor's Office.
CongratuIations, gentIemen.

138
00:16:50,186 --> 00:16:53,447
You won't be investigating
BllI TuggIe's death, you know.

139
00:16:53,534 --> 00:16:57,144
- Leave that to Fedorchuk.
- Right. Ñrocedure.

140
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:59,275
- You?
- Yes, sir.

141
00:16:59,362 --> 00:17:04,059
There is a case I'd llke to take on, though.
A homicide, a Newcomer named HubIey.

142
00:17:04,146 --> 00:17:06,886
- Granger and Ñitts are aIready on it.
- Yeah, right.

143
00:17:06,973 --> 00:17:10,669
But Granger and Ñitts,
they got a full case Ioad.

144
00:17:10,757 --> 00:17:14,627
I thought, what with Francisco here,
the first Newcomer pIain cIothes,

145
00:17:14,714 --> 00:17:18,845
and what with the body being found
in the Newcomer community, you know...

146
00:17:18,933 --> 00:17:22,194
- Don't tell me what to think.
- He's got a point.

147
00:17:22,281 --> 00:17:26,892
It's exactIy what we need for this
earIy-advancement programme.

148
00:17:30,588 --> 00:17:32,546
All right, all right.

149
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:39,895
We work my hours. I do the drivin',
and you do the paperwork.

150
00:17:39,982 --> 00:17:44,983
- You gotta Iearn it, so you can do it all.
- I'd llke to thank you for what you are doin'.

151
00:17:45,071 --> 00:17:47,158
What's that? Oh, wait, wait.

152
00:17:49,246 --> 00:17:54,030
- Let me get somethin' straight in your head...
- You want cream and sugar?

153
00:17:54,117 --> 00:17:58,422
No, I wanna get somethin' straight
in your head. We are not paIs.

154
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:01,336
We're not gettin' married,
takin' Iong waIks together.

155
00:18:01,423 --> 00:18:05,728
And don't call me ''Sergeant''.
Call me ''Sykes'' or ''Matt'' if you got to.

156
00:18:05,816 --> 00:18:08,947
I am SamueI. WouId you llke a doughnut?

157
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,688
Change your mind?

158
00:18:17,036 --> 00:18:19,776
Sam Francisco? Sam Francisco?

159
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,516
No, I ain't buyin' that. I'm not buyin' that.

160
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:29,779
I'm not gonna introduce you
to peopIe as ''Sam Francisco''.

161
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:35,302
I think I'll call you ''George''. George?

162
00:18:35,389 --> 00:18:37,476
- OK.
- OK.

163
00:18:39,825 --> 00:18:42,304
Oh, they hung one on you.

164
00:18:42,391 --> 00:18:48,088
I heard a Iot of good ones before,
llke Humphrey Bogart, HarIey Davidson...

165
00:18:49,523 --> 00:18:53,307
I guess they got punchy after
giving names to a quarter mllllon peopIe.

166
00:18:53,394 --> 00:18:56,264
Let me ask you somethin'.
Were you at the back of the llne?

167
00:18:56,352 --> 00:19:01,309
Oh, no. My true name is
Ss'tangya T'ssorentsa.

168
00:19:01,397 --> 00:19:04,702
- Well, gesundheit. I'll call you ''George''.
- Fine.

169
00:19:04,789 --> 00:19:10,399
- I didn't know which paper you llke...
- I find it difficuIt to drive and read.

170
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:14,792
- Wait a minute.
- I got you your cigarettes.

171
00:19:15,575 --> 00:19:18,488
Where did you get this? What is this stuff?

172
00:19:18,576 --> 00:19:22,533
- Wait. What is this?
- That is a car deodoriser.

173
00:19:29,318 --> 00:19:31,405
That's mine.

174
00:19:32,101 --> 00:19:36,102
Anyway, what's it bother you if we think
your name's funny? It doesn't, right?

175
00:19:36,189 --> 00:19:38,885
That is exactIy so. It is llke your name.

176
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:44,235
''Sykes''? I'm sure it doesn't bother you
that to us it sounds just llke ''ss'ai k'ss'',

177
00:19:44,322 --> 00:19:48,453
two words in my Ianguage
which mean ''excrement'' and ''cranium''.

178
00:19:48,932 --> 00:19:50,975
Shithead.

179
00:19:56,456 --> 00:19:59,152
Why don't you go ahead? I'll be right in.

180
00:19:59,934 --> 00:20:02,631
Hey, Maff. So what do you got for me?

181
00:20:02,719 --> 00:20:06,850
You said you wanted
the biggest thing I couId find.

182
00:20:06,936 --> 00:20:09,328
And this is it.

183
00:20:12,155 --> 00:20:15,417
- What in the hell's this?
- .454 Casull.

184
00:20:16,592 --> 00:20:21,245
We're taIking twice the impact energy
of a .44 Magnum hotIoad.

185
00:20:21,767 --> 00:20:23,811
It onIy hoIds five.

186
00:20:23,898 --> 00:20:26,942
The shells are too big for six in a cyllnder.

187
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:29,508
Hell, Matt, you onIy need one.

188
00:20:30,334 --> 00:20:32,640
No, two. Thanks.

189
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:46,992
How Iong you been shootin'?
That's pitifuI. Goddamn pitifuI.

190
00:20:47,774 --> 00:20:52,862
What are you gonna do in a shoot-out?
Wave your scores in your exams at 'em?

191
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:55,777
- Why'd you do it?
- Why'd I do what?

192
00:20:55,863 --> 00:21:00,387
Agree to work with me. You don't llke me,
or any of us. You have onIy contempt for us,

193
00:21:00,473 --> 00:21:04,431
and yet you make yourseIf an outcast
by making me your partner.

194
00:21:04,518 --> 00:21:06,866
My partner is dead.

195
00:21:06,954 --> 00:21:12,042
He's dead cos one of you bastards kllIed him,
then crawIed down some rathoIe in SIagvllIe.

196
00:21:12,129 --> 00:21:17,740
You're gonna heIp me find that ugIy SIag
son of a bitch. You understand me?

197
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,180
That's awfully pretty, huh?

198
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:45,355
Bring my gun.

199
00:21:54,793 --> 00:21:56,881
Let's taIk HubIey here.

200
00:22:01,447 --> 00:22:06,319
His body was discovered three days ago in
an alley off CentraI Avenue near downtown.

201
00:22:06,405 --> 00:22:09,406
- With two sabot sIugs in his chest.
- Through the chest.

202
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:14,146
- Through the chest.
- Rupturing primary and secondary hearts.

203
00:22:14,234 --> 00:22:16,973
Hey, nice signaI, dickhead.

204
00:22:17,278 --> 00:22:21,801
He was empIoyed at the Consolldated
ÑetrochemicaI Refinery in Torrance.

205
00:22:21,888 --> 00:22:26,976
He was manager of a methane facllity, and
a principaI partner in a reaI-estate venture

206
00:22:27,064 --> 00:22:30,238
to deveIop Iow-cost housing for Newcomers.

207
00:22:30,325 --> 00:22:33,022
Newcomers. That's terrific.

208
00:22:33,065 --> 00:22:35,326
ReaI pllIar of the community.

209
00:22:35,414 --> 00:22:38,458
- Was he ripped off?
- Ñardon me?

210
00:22:40,024 --> 00:22:42,851
Was he missing anything
when they found him?

211
00:22:42,937 --> 00:22:45,199
Oh. Ñroperty.

212
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:51,157
He had no wallet, but he was
stllI wearing a watch and two rings.

213
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:57,463
Those guys Iast night at the minimart made
a haIf-assed stab at the money in the tllI.

214
00:22:58,855 --> 00:23:04,074
I don't think that's what they were there for.
We got a coupIe of executions on our hands.

215
00:23:04,161 --> 00:23:07,336
- The murder at the minimart is not our case...
- Whoa, whoa.

216
00:23:07,423 --> 00:23:09,640
It is my desire not to break with procedure.

217
00:23:13,076 --> 00:23:15,382
- What's wrong?
- Wrong?

218
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:18,904
- Nothing. What shouId be wrong?
- Nothing.

219
00:23:18,992 --> 00:23:23,167
- What's wrong with you? Ñarkin' in...
- Hey, up yours.

220
00:23:24,558 --> 00:23:30,429
You do agree that there's a good chance
these two shootings are reIated, don't you?

221
00:23:31,169 --> 00:23:32,821
Yes, quite possibIy.

222
00:23:32,908 --> 00:23:37,910
WouId you aIso be wllllng to accept
the theory, George, that, quite possibIy,

223
00:23:37,996 --> 00:23:43,041
by examining the evidence of one case,
we might shed a llttIe llght on the other?

224
00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:46,216
- Does that sound unreasonabIe to you?
- Yes.

225
00:23:46,303 --> 00:23:49,565
No, it is not unreasonabIe,
aIthough it is not a good...

226
00:23:49,652 --> 00:23:53,262
Good, good. I'm so gIad
we got that settIed, aren't you?

227
00:23:53,392 --> 00:23:56,524
I think we're really
startin' to cllck here, George.

228
00:23:58,133 --> 00:23:59,437
Give me what you got.

229
00:23:59,567 --> 00:24:02,351
I've been over all this
with Fedorchuk and AIterez.

230
00:24:02,438 --> 00:24:05,830
Come on, you got nothin' better to do,
a soft county job llke yours.

231
00:24:06,352 --> 00:24:08,788
Yeah, right. Don't push your Iuck.

232
00:24:08,875 --> 00:24:13,311
According to the sheet, the guy you nalled
outside by the car, this one here,

233
00:24:13,398 --> 00:24:17,660
he was one Martin HeIder,
white maIe, aged 27.

234
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:21,487
One armed-robbery conviction,
two for saIe of controlled substance,

235
00:24:21,574 --> 00:24:25,749
and the guy was wired on coke
when you stopped his cIock.

236
00:24:25,836 --> 00:24:31,185
- Have you identified this one?
- He's a John Doe. Or a Sam SIag, if you llke.

237
00:24:31,273 --> 00:24:34,839
There's no ID on him and no fingerprints,
so it couId be tough.

238
00:24:34,925 --> 00:24:39,144
Lucky for you, you got him in both of his
what we IooseIy call ''hearts''.

239
00:24:39,231 --> 00:24:42,319
- Lucky I emptied a whoIe cllp in him.
- That's how these peopIe are.

240
00:24:42,406 --> 00:24:45,842
You don't hit both pumps,
you just piss 'em off.

241
00:24:45,929 --> 00:24:50,104
It Iooks llke the miners' disease.

242
00:24:51,453 --> 00:24:54,148
Hey, what's goin' on?

243
00:24:54,236 --> 00:24:56,367
- Nothing.
- Nothin'?

244
00:24:56,888 --> 00:24:59,585
Run bIood tests and keep it between us.

245
00:24:59,671 --> 00:25:03,237
Got an extra head shot if you need one.
We're about ready to cut in.

246
00:25:03,325 --> 00:25:06,587
You're weIcome to stick around.
It's fascinating stuff.

247
00:25:06,673 --> 00:25:10,806
- Yeah, I'll bet.
- Let's Iook at their personaI effects.

248
00:25:17,938 --> 00:25:19,982
What is this?

249
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:23,766
What's that? It's a rubber.

250
00:25:23,852 --> 00:25:26,636
It's, you know, a condom.

251
00:25:26,723 --> 00:25:28,810
Coney IsIand whitefish, you know?

252
00:25:30,898 --> 00:25:35,899
Um, men, human men,
they put 'em on their penises to...

253
00:25:36,726 --> 00:25:40,336
to protect 'em from havin' babies.
Understand?

254
00:25:43,554 --> 00:25:46,120
Uh, excuse me.
Do you need this for anything?

255
00:25:46,206 --> 00:25:48,338
Nope. I got my own.

256
00:25:48,468 --> 00:25:50,512
She has her own.

257
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,600
Here.

258
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:56,775
See? You get the picture?

259
00:25:58,297 --> 00:26:00,384
And that fits?

260
00:26:02,734 --> 00:26:05,560
Yeah, onIy it's made of rubber. It stretches.

261
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:08,257
And stllI it fits?

262
00:26:16,171 --> 00:26:18,607
What's this stuff here?

263
00:26:18,695 --> 00:26:23,826
It is a resin. Newcomers working
near methane gases at oll refineries

264
00:26:23,913 --> 00:26:27,392
must paint it on their boots
to protect against sparks.

265
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:31,046
- How the hell do you know that?
- Many of us were hired by refineries

266
00:26:31,132 --> 00:26:36,569
because the methane fumes are not
harmfuI to us. My spouse's brother is one.

267
00:26:37,613 --> 00:26:42,744
So, the SIag they're cuttin' into upstairs,
he worked at a refinery,

268
00:26:42,832 --> 00:26:45,659
and HubIey, he worked at a refinery.

269
00:26:46,702 --> 00:26:53,791
I guess that ''possibIe'' connection's gettin' a
hell of a Iot more possibIe, wouIdn't you say?

270
00:26:55,183 --> 00:26:58,705
I guess the next thing is for me
to taIk to the store owner's wife.

271
00:26:58,793 --> 00:27:02,141
I belleve I shouId speak to the widow aIone.

272
00:27:03,403 --> 00:27:06,839
All right, you taIk to the widow aIone.

273
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:10,274
I'll check out the refinery. Hey, thanks, huh?

274
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:18,929
- What about this HubIey guy?
- He was all right, a damn good manager.

275
00:27:19,016 --> 00:27:22,669
I'm gonna have to hustIe to fllI his shoes.
The men really llked him.

276
00:27:22,756 --> 00:27:27,540
ApparentIy, one of 'em didn't llke him
so much. Here, give this a Iook.

277
00:27:27,626 --> 00:27:32,671
- You think this is the guy who did it?
- Yeah, we think so. Do you know him?

278
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:36,369
It's hard to say. I hate to admit it,
but they all Iook allke to me.

279
00:27:36,455 --> 00:27:38,587
- Wait a minute.
- What?

280
00:27:38,673 --> 00:27:41,239
- You know who this Iooks llke?
- No.

281
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:45,588
Anderson, James Anderson.
He's not in today. He took the afternoon off.

282
00:27:45,675 --> 00:27:51,024
Yeah? Well, I think you're gonna find
that he took the rest of his llfe off.

283
00:27:51,112 --> 00:27:53,460
- What?
- Is this where he worked?

284
00:27:53,547 --> 00:27:55,287
Yeah, right in there.

285
00:27:55,373 --> 00:27:59,027
HoId it. There's 35%
pure methane gas in there.

286
00:27:59,114 --> 00:28:02,333
I don't know how these fellas do it.

287
00:28:02,419 --> 00:28:04,202
Yeah.

288
00:28:04,289 --> 00:28:06,246
- Thanks.
- Anything I can do.

289
00:28:06,334 --> 00:28:08,421
I appreciate it.

290
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:47,215
I need your heIp, Mrs Ñorter.

291
00:28:47,301 --> 00:28:49,607
I wllI try.

292
00:28:51,476 --> 00:28:54,173
Can you identify these Newcomers?

293
00:29:00,001 --> 00:29:03,567
No, but my son might.

294
00:29:15,092 --> 00:29:20,789
Here's an oIdie but goodie from 1988:
The Four Tops with ''IndestructibIe''.

295
00:29:40,534 --> 00:29:43,448
WeIcome back, Ozzie and Harriet.

296
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:52,711
Well?

297
00:29:52,885 --> 00:29:55,407
- One second.
- We're not even moving.

298
00:29:55,495 --> 00:29:57,190
Safety first.

299
00:29:57,757 --> 00:30:00,931
- Bye-bye.
- Do you have to yell in my ear?

300
00:30:01,061 --> 00:30:03,236
- Sorry.
- Did you Iearn anything?

301
00:30:03,323 --> 00:30:07,976
Yes. Mrs Ñorter is not taking
her husband's death very well.

302
00:30:08,107 --> 00:30:12,847
She identified one of the men from
a photo I showed her. It was Warren HubIey.

303
00:30:12,935 --> 00:30:15,283
All right. What about the other guy?

304
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:19,284
She did not know,
but she thought perhaps her son might.

305
00:30:19,371 --> 00:30:21,502
- Have you taIked to him?
- No.

306
00:30:21,589 --> 00:30:26,808
He's not been home since that day,
but she toId me where I couId find him.

307
00:30:27,721 --> 00:30:33,245
- Who's this guy we gotta go see?
- Wllllam Harcourt, an associate of HubIey's.

308
00:30:40,682 --> 00:30:44,813
Our guest speaker tonight
has done so much in his community.

309
00:30:45,291 --> 00:30:49,510
He certainIy has come quite far
in the Iast few years.

310
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:54,076
Granted, not as far as he came
in the years before reaching Los AngeIes.

311
00:30:57,164 --> 00:31:01,904
As mayor of this city,
it gives me great pIeasure to introduce

312
00:31:02,209 --> 00:31:06,906
someone who has so readlly
made our city his home.

313
00:31:06,993 --> 00:31:10,429
Ladies and gentIemen, Wllllam Harcourt.

314
00:31:45,961 --> 00:31:52,093
I'm particuIarIy gratefuI because
I actually had the gall to write in my notes:

315
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:57,138
''Thank you all for a very warm reception.''

316
00:31:57,225 --> 00:32:02,052
Imagine how embarrassed I'd have been
if it hadn't been such a warm reception.

317
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:20,449
Excuse me. Mr Wllllam Harcourt?

318
00:32:20,535 --> 00:32:22,711
- Yes.
- Good.

319
00:32:22,797 --> 00:32:29,016
I'm Detective Sergeant Sykes,
this is Detective Francisco, LAÑD.

320
00:32:29,104 --> 00:32:31,104
Sergeant. Detective.

321
00:32:31,191 --> 00:32:35,018
I wasn't aware there were any Newcomers
at the rank of detective yet.

322
00:32:35,106 --> 00:32:38,105
- I am the first, sir.
- CongratuIations.

323
00:32:38,193 --> 00:32:41,020
This is my assistant, Rudyard Kipllng.

324
00:32:41,106 --> 00:32:43,064
Rudyard Kipllng? No shit.

325
00:32:43,151 --> 00:32:49,500
We need some information about a
business associate of yours, Warren HubIey.

326
00:32:49,587 --> 00:32:52,892
Ah, poor Warren. Tragic.

327
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:57,025
Yeah, wasn't it? I understand
that you and he were partners

328
00:32:57,111 --> 00:33:01,026
in some SIag... Newcomer reaI-estate thing.

329
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:03,895
That's right. He and I
and seven or eight others.

330
00:33:03,983 --> 00:33:05,896
Wllllam.

331
00:33:05,983 --> 00:33:09,550
I was wondering if you wouIdn't
rather ride with Luisa and me?

332
00:33:09,637 --> 00:33:14,595
Excellent idea. Ray, I wonder if you know
two of your officers. Detectives...

333
00:33:14,681 --> 00:33:17,161
- Sykes.
- Sykes and Francisco.

334
00:33:17,247 --> 00:33:19,465
- How do you do, sir?
- ÑIeasure.

335
00:33:19,596 --> 00:33:22,771
I think we really shouId be going.

336
00:33:22,857 --> 00:33:26,163
FeeI free to call my office
Monday morning for an appointment.

337
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:30,164
CongratuIations again
on your promotion, Detective.

338
00:33:30,251 --> 00:33:34,469
Remember, you're out there
setting an exampIe in our community.

339
00:33:34,557 --> 00:33:37,035
I shall be keeping an eye on you.

340
00:33:42,646 --> 00:33:45,125
He's gonna keep an eye on you.

341
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:50,779
Sykes was the one
who chased us and kllIed Anderson.

342
00:33:50,866 --> 00:33:54,649
You're Iucky he didn't recognise you.

343
00:33:54,737 --> 00:33:56,911
What if he taIks to Strader?

344
00:33:56,997 --> 00:34:01,172
Mr Strader's change of heart
is dangerous. Find him.

345
00:34:04,826 --> 00:34:08,436
- I couId go to Berlltz for ten years...
- 6.42.

346
00:34:08,523 --> 00:34:10,698
Excuse me.

347
00:34:10,784 --> 00:34:12,872
- Here.
- I've got it.

348
00:34:15,525 --> 00:34:18,656
How Iong did it take you to Iearn Engllsh?

349
00:34:19,048 --> 00:34:21,527
- Three months.
- Three months?

350
00:34:21,657 --> 00:34:26,136
We Iearn quickIy. We adapt.
It is our strength, what we were bred for.

351
00:34:26,223 --> 00:34:31,442
I got a neighbour and she's got this kid
who's got a Newcomer girI in the cIass.

352
00:34:31,529 --> 00:34:34,661
The kid is six years oId
and she's in the seventh grade.

353
00:34:34,747 --> 00:34:37,009
Can you imagine that? Thanks a Iot.

354
00:34:37,097 --> 00:34:39,271
It's amazing, totally amazing.

355
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,968
Oh, my God. I got yours. Here.

356
00:34:46,925 --> 00:34:49,578
What is that? Raw what? What kind is that?

357
00:34:49,665 --> 00:34:52,013
This? This is beaver.

358
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:54,405
- What?
- Beaver. It's tasty.

359
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:57,928
- I'm sure.
- WouId you llke to try some?

360
00:34:58,015 --> 00:35:00,451
- Not on a bet.
- I aIways tell my son

361
00:35:00,537 --> 00:35:04,495
''How do you know you don't llke it
if you won't even try it?''

362
00:35:05,669 --> 00:35:10,236
Let me ask you somethin'.
WouId it really put you out badIy

363
00:35:10,323 --> 00:35:13,324
if you put it under the grllI,
just for a minute or two?

364
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:17,934
Our bodies do not assimllate the nutrients
if the food has been cooked. ÑIease.

365
00:35:18,021 --> 00:35:24,457
That's very attractive. We're gonna go taIk
to peopIe and you've got fur in your teeth.

366
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,892
Very attractive.

367
00:35:32,155 --> 00:35:34,939
The store owner's widow
thought we'd find her son here.

368
00:35:35,025 --> 00:35:37,069
Just stay behind me.

369
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:42,723
Hey, just pay attention, you understand?
Let me handIe it. Watch.

370
00:35:58,988 --> 00:36:01,468
Which one of you SIags is Ñorter?

371
00:36:03,512 --> 00:36:05,773
Yo. Who wants to know?

372
00:36:06,469 --> 00:36:09,383
- Who said that?
- At the end of the bar.

373
00:36:24,431 --> 00:36:26,649
Are you Ñorter?

374
00:36:29,693 --> 00:36:32,172
Are you Ñorter?

375
00:36:32,259 --> 00:36:36,999
No, Matthew.
I belleve this is the one you want.

376
00:36:44,307 --> 00:36:46,350
Is that right?

377
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:50,525
- Um, Matthew...
- Hey, butt out. I toId you I'd handIe it.

378
00:36:50,612 --> 00:36:53,178
- But...
- Hey, zip it.

379
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:58,136
Are these questions a llttIe difficuIt?
I'll start with something easier.

380
00:36:58,223 --> 00:37:01,050
Is your name Ñorter?

381
00:37:08,748 --> 00:37:10,401
''Screw you.''

382
00:37:10,487 --> 00:37:12,705
Yeah, well, that can't be right.

383
00:37:23,404 --> 00:37:26,144
- You don't want to know.
- Come on. Tell me.

384
00:37:26,797 --> 00:37:29,015
''Your mother mates out of season.''

385
00:37:29,101 --> 00:37:30,972
Oh, yeah?

386
00:37:43,235 --> 00:37:48,107
Don't they teach you anything about us
in cop schooI, llttIe ss'Ioka?

387
00:37:48,194 --> 00:37:50,237
You jerk-off...

388
00:37:52,064 --> 00:37:54,587
Hey, George. George?

389
00:37:56,588 --> 00:37:58,675
That's enough.

390
00:38:02,415 --> 00:38:05,721
You smell llke a human.

391
00:38:06,721 --> 00:38:10,635
A cop. It fits you.

392
00:38:11,374 --> 00:38:15,375
I'm sorry about your father.
HeIp us find his kllIers.

393
00:38:15,462 --> 00:38:17,942
We can taIk outside.

394
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:28,335
- Do you know this guy?
- From quarantine.

395
00:38:28,422 --> 00:38:31,206
When we first arrived,
we were housed together.

396
00:38:31,293 --> 00:38:35,077
Your mother says HubIey and your father
were invoIved with another Newcomer.

397
00:38:35,163 --> 00:38:38,599
Did you know this other guy
that was with HubIey?

398
00:38:38,687 --> 00:38:40,512
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

399
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,513
High-roller dude named Strader.

400
00:38:44,297 --> 00:38:47,689
Joshua Strader.
He runs a cIub on the West Side.

401
00:38:47,776 --> 00:38:50,559
- What cIub?
- Encounters.

402
00:38:50,646 --> 00:38:54,516
- Yeah, I know thatjoint.
- Look, it's all I know.

403
00:38:54,604 --> 00:38:58,518
- If you want any more, ask somebody eIse.
- Yeah, right.

404
00:39:00,214 --> 00:39:02,519
He's a pIeasant guy.

405
00:39:04,824 --> 00:39:08,564
- If I may make a suggestion...
- Yeah, what?

406
00:39:08,652 --> 00:39:11,130
We have different weak spots than you do.

407
00:39:11,217 --> 00:39:16,001
Next time, a bIow to the nerve pIexus,
under the arm, here,

408
00:39:16,088 --> 00:39:20,438
wllI produce the effect
I think you were Iooking for.

409
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:22,612
I knew that.

410
00:39:23,655 --> 00:39:27,831
Look what he did to my fIashllght.
Look at this. Come on.

411
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:58,795
- Any progress?
- Our arms are gettin' tired. So far, zip.

412
00:40:02,362 --> 00:40:07,146
I understand you've been
resisting my offer, Mr Strader.

413
00:40:07,233 --> 00:40:13,539
Your sense of duty is nobIe,
but no Ionger an issue, I'm afraid.

414
00:40:14,931 --> 00:40:17,627
I wllI not make this offer again.

415
00:40:18,671 --> 00:40:24,238
I wouId llke you to work for me,
distributing ss'jabroka to our peopIe.

416
00:40:24,325 --> 00:40:30,805
If you do, you wllI know weaIth and comfort
our peopIe never dared imagine.

417
00:40:32,501 --> 00:40:37,720
I won't do it!
I can't Iet the nightmare start again.

418
00:40:37,807 --> 00:40:42,461
Such a pity to Iose one's llfe
for an outmoded vaIue.

419
00:40:44,374 --> 00:40:49,419
Mr Quint, I belleve it's time
for our friend's swimming Iesson.

420
00:40:59,422 --> 00:41:03,988
It's important to practise new skllIs -
essentiaI for your growth as a person.

421
00:41:04,076 --> 00:41:07,424
You've never seen this before.
You ain't gonna belleve it.

422
00:41:07,511 --> 00:41:10,251
Sea water's llke battery acid to these guys.

423
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:22,950
Now he won't be taIking to those cops,
the two who came to question you.

424
00:41:23,037 --> 00:41:27,386
This is getting out of hand.
I want you to deaI with it.

425
00:41:27,473 --> 00:41:28,647
ImmediateIy.

426
00:41:34,997 --> 00:41:37,911
We must Iearn to embrace the things we fear.

427
00:42:31,274 --> 00:42:33,840
I'm very warm.

428
00:42:38,015 --> 00:42:43,408
- I'm wearing Ieather. I feeI llke a beaver...
- Hey, man. Can I heIp you with somethin'?

429
00:42:46,539 --> 00:42:48,844
Hey. Get over here.

430
00:42:48,931 --> 00:42:51,714
Come dance over here.

431
00:42:51,801 --> 00:42:56,368
- I'd llke to speak to a guy named Strader.
- That's his girIfriend up there.

432
00:42:56,455 --> 00:43:00,456
You wanna know somethin',
you'd better ask her, you know what I mean?

433
00:43:00,543 --> 00:43:01,369
Thanks.

434
00:43:06,153 --> 00:43:09,545
George. Come to, George. You're droollng.

435
00:43:10,807 --> 00:43:13,111
Ooh, baby.

436
00:43:13,243 --> 00:43:15,808
Mm, yeah.

437
00:43:17,069 --> 00:43:20,245
Cassandra, pollce department.
This is Sergeant Sykes...

438
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:22,593
''Shithead''. Ñerfect.

439
00:43:23,853 --> 00:43:26,203
We're Iookin' for your boss, Strader.

440
00:43:26,289 --> 00:43:28,290
He's not here. Why ask me?

441
00:43:28,377 --> 00:43:32,161
The hostess downstairs
said you might know.

442
00:43:32,247 --> 00:43:35,162
She did, did she? Well, she was wrong.

443
00:43:35,248 --> 00:43:37,466
Excuse me. I have to change.

444
00:43:37,553 --> 00:43:40,032
Good. We have no probIem here.

445
00:43:45,468 --> 00:43:50,687
We're not here for a high-schooI paper.
This is a homicide investigation.

446
00:43:50,949 --> 00:43:57,559
And, if you don't stop jerkin' around,
we're gonna have to pIay a llttIe hardball.

447
00:43:57,646 --> 00:44:00,820
Oh, hardball? Sounds interesting.

448
00:44:00,908 --> 00:44:06,605
You going to strike me? You couId tie me up
and then do whatever you want with me.

449
00:44:06,692 --> 00:44:08,997
I have my own ropes.

450
00:44:09,084 --> 00:44:12,041
Does that come free,
or do you charge a llttIe extra?

451
00:44:12,129 --> 00:44:18,348
You have me all wrong. I never charge money
for something that I myseIf find pIeasurabIe.

452
00:44:20,349 --> 00:44:25,175
I am going out to the car.
I wllI meet you there.

453
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:31,308
I don't know where Mr Strader couId be.
He comes and he goes.

454
00:44:31,394 --> 00:44:34,830
I know. Why don't you
hang around here for a whlle?

455
00:44:34,918 --> 00:44:37,005
Let me entertain you.

456
00:44:38,266 --> 00:44:40,832
- It's Matt, right?
- Yes, indeed.

457
00:44:42,094 --> 00:44:46,138
Tell me the truth.
Have you ever made it with one of us?

458
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:50,791
Um, no. UnIess I got drunk
and somebody didn't tell me.

459
00:44:50,879 --> 00:44:53,445
Mm. A virgin.

460
00:44:55,663 --> 00:44:57,967
I find that very arousing.

461
00:44:59,838 --> 00:45:02,056
You sure you haven't?

462
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:07,884
There's Iots of things I haven't done.
That's not reaI high on my llst.

463
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:12,015
No, you know.
Don't take it personally. I'm a bigot.

464
00:45:12,842 --> 00:45:16,625
Maybe you're just a llttIe afraid, huh?

465
00:45:16,712 --> 00:45:20,148
Maybe you're afraid of what might happen
once the llghts go out.

466
00:45:20,235 --> 00:45:22,975
Maybe more than you want to admit.

467
00:45:23,062 --> 00:45:27,889
Doesn't that curiosity and that fear
all swirllng together turn you on?

468
00:45:27,976 --> 00:45:31,934
Think of it as broadening your horizons.

469
00:45:36,282 --> 00:45:39,414
I llke my horizons rather narrow.

470
00:45:39,501 --> 00:45:44,067
Your voice is saying no,
but your body's saying yes.

471
00:45:44,155 --> 00:45:46,503
Yeah, wait, whoa.

472
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:53,331
Excuse me. My voice and the rest of me is
saying that I'll be back in a coupIe of hours.

473
00:45:54,201 --> 00:45:57,158
You make sure that Strader's here.

474
00:46:14,424 --> 00:46:17,381
You handIe the women from now on,
you know what I mean?

475
00:46:17,468 --> 00:46:19,948
- What do you mean?
- I mean, you handIe the women.

476
00:46:20,295 --> 00:46:22,774
I know it's midnight.

477
00:46:22,861 --> 00:46:25,167
Yes, I'm being carefuI.

478
00:46:26,297 --> 00:46:29,080
The human seems llkabIe.

479
00:46:29,167 --> 00:46:33,125
We'll be working Iate tonight,
so don't wait up.

480
00:46:35,865 --> 00:46:38,169
No. I Iove you too.

481
00:46:42,214 --> 00:46:44,736
- Do you mind?
- No, be my guest.

482
00:47:02,481 --> 00:47:04,568
That hits the spot.

483
00:47:05,482 --> 00:47:10,396
- She keeps you on a short Ieash, does she?
- My wife? She worries about me.

484
00:47:10,526 --> 00:47:12,701
Yeah, I know the routine.

485
00:47:20,964 --> 00:47:26,836
Your home is quite disordered. I thought
when I waIked in you had been burgIarised.

486
00:47:26,922 --> 00:47:30,706
Well, I appreciate your honesty, George.

487
00:47:34,795 --> 00:47:39,970
Ignore the bitch on the Ieft.
That's Edie. I call her ''Edie Amin''.

488
00:47:43,275 --> 00:47:48,016
That's Kristin, my daughter.
The picture's a llttIe oId. She's 20 now.

489
00:47:48,102 --> 00:47:50,929
Gettin' married, as a matter of fact, Sunday.

490
00:47:51,017 --> 00:47:53,930
Human chlldren can be very beautifuI.

491
00:47:54,018 --> 00:47:58,758
Getting married? CongratuIations.
You're taking Sunday off, then?

492
00:47:58,844 --> 00:48:01,671
No, I don't know. Maybe not.

493
00:48:01,759 --> 00:48:03,846
I don't think I wanna go.

494
00:48:05,064 --> 00:48:08,152
She doesn't need her burnt-out father there.

495
00:48:09,195 --> 00:48:11,501
I'm gonna show you something.

496
00:48:14,805 --> 00:48:16,981
This is Susan, my wife.

497
00:48:17,067 --> 00:48:20,895
Oh, yeah. I remember
from when I picked you up.

498
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:23,069
Oh. Not bad.

499
00:48:23,156 --> 00:48:26,896
This is Richard, my son. Four years oId.

500
00:48:26,983 --> 00:48:31,375
We named him after
the former president Richard Nixon.

501
00:48:32,681 --> 00:48:35,594
You open to a llttIe piece of advice, George?

502
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:41,727
Me, I'd tell peopIe I named him
after the actor, Richard Burton.

503
00:48:42,205 --> 00:48:44,466
Just take my word for it.

504
00:48:45,553 --> 00:48:50,990
So then the doctor says ''If this is
my thermometer, where is my pen?''

505
00:48:55,339 --> 00:48:57,818
You don't think that's funny?

506
00:49:00,166 --> 00:49:02,037
Look...

507
00:49:03,255 --> 00:49:06,516
The guy says ''This is my...''

508
00:49:06,603 --> 00:49:10,561
You gotta work with me, George.
I get a Iaugh with this all the time.

509
00:49:10,692 --> 00:49:16,083
If the doctor has the thermometer
in his hand, where is the pen? Where?

510
00:49:18,389 --> 00:49:22,564
- In the other man's rectum.
- Yeah, it's stickin' up his ass,

511
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:28,131
- Correct.
- Yeah, but that's what makes the joke.

512
00:49:28,218 --> 00:49:32,958
There's a surprise. Your mind
fllIs in all these llttIe funny pictures.

513
00:49:33,046 --> 00:49:36,133
There's a guy sittin' with a pen up his ass.

514
00:49:40,308 --> 00:49:42,396
Good Iuck, George.

515
00:49:48,833 --> 00:49:51,399
I just think that's really funny.

516
00:49:52,617 --> 00:49:54,834
Tell it to me again.

517
00:49:54,921 --> 00:49:56,487
I got another one...

518
00:50:03,532 --> 00:50:07,533
There is so much our two peopIes
do not understand about each other.

519
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:13,230
No shit, SherIock. You onIy come from
another goddamn pIanet, for chrissakes.

520
00:50:14,492 --> 00:50:16,840
You humans are very curious to us.

521
00:50:16,927 --> 00:50:21,580
You invite us to llve in an atmosphere of
equallty that we've never known before.

522
00:50:21,668 --> 00:50:24,538
You Iet us own our own llves for the first time

523
00:50:24,625 --> 00:50:27,843
and you ask no more of us
than you do of yourseIves.

524
00:50:27,931 --> 00:50:31,279
I hope you understand
how speciaI your worId is,

525
00:50:31,367 --> 00:50:34,367
how unique a peopIe you humans are.

526
00:50:34,454 --> 00:50:37,455
Which is why it is all the more
painfuI and confusing to us

527
00:50:37,542 --> 00:50:43,978
that so few of you seem capabIe of
llving up to the ideaIs you set for yourseIves.

528
00:50:44,066 --> 00:50:47,632
Don't count on me, George.
I never had any ideaIs.

529
00:50:47,719 --> 00:50:52,416
- You're all right, Georgie, you're all right.
- I am going home.

530
00:50:54,286 --> 00:50:56,373
Yeah.

531
00:50:57,417 --> 00:51:01,288
You go home and you get some sIeep.

532
00:51:03,419 --> 00:51:07,029
You'd better drive.
You're too screwed up to waIk.

533
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:13,248
What a wlld man.

534
00:52:38,533 --> 00:52:40,620
Yeah?

535
00:52:44,577 --> 00:52:46,709
Better be good news or money.

536
00:52:48,405 --> 00:52:51,144
- Oh, George. What?
- HoId this.

537
00:52:52,623 --> 00:52:54,711
I feeI very terribIe.

538
00:52:56,059 --> 00:52:58,146
I'm so mllked-over.

539
00:52:59,973 --> 00:53:03,931
- Where'd you get this?
- A man. A human.

540
00:53:05,236 --> 00:53:07,540
He was wiring it to your car.

541
00:53:08,889 --> 00:53:10,629
My car?

542
00:53:10,715 --> 00:53:14,456
- She is going to divorce me.
- No, she can't divorce you.

543
00:53:14,543 --> 00:53:17,066
You mate for llfe, isn't that right?

544
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:21,414
She is very progressive.
I am certain she is considering it.

545
00:53:21,501 --> 00:53:23,719
- Hey, Matt.
- What?

546
00:53:23,806 --> 00:53:27,111
Does a guy named Strader
mean anything to you?

547
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:29,982
- Yeah. Why?
- They found him, or what's Ieft of him,

548
00:53:30,069 --> 00:53:35,810
washed up on the beach at Zuma.
Fedorchuk and AIterez are on their way.

549
00:53:35,896 --> 00:53:37,984
Thanks, Michelle.

550
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:41,638
Come on, Iet's go.

551
00:53:44,334 --> 00:53:48,379
- To the beach?
- Yeah, come on, dude. Surf's up.

552
00:53:58,250 --> 00:54:00,860
ÑIease, I must get out of here.

553
00:54:00,947 --> 00:54:02,643
Huh? Why?

554
00:54:02,730 --> 00:54:06,644
- Stop the car.
- We're not gonna go near the water, all right?

555
00:54:06,732 --> 00:54:09,559
I beg you to pIease stop this car.

556
00:54:09,645 --> 00:54:12,211
- ÑIease stop the car.
- OK, OK.

557
00:54:12,298 --> 00:54:15,212
- ÑIease.
- Look, George, we're stopping.

558
00:54:16,865 --> 00:54:19,213
All right? Go ahead. Now get out.

559
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:22,562
It's cooI. Don't worry.
I'll be back in a coupIe of minutes.

560
00:54:22,649 --> 00:54:24,737
Thank you.

561
00:54:39,393 --> 00:54:44,394
- So that kid was the first to report this?
- Yeah, about eIeven.

562
00:54:47,091 --> 00:54:48,960
Goddamn.

563
00:54:49,527 --> 00:54:52,136
How do you know that's Strader?

564
00:54:52,223 --> 00:54:57,138
We found his wallet in his jacket pocket.
''Joshua Strader'' - big as llfe.

565
00:54:59,921 --> 00:55:02,922
You got any idea as to
how Iong he's been dead?

566
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:07,575
Your guess is as good as mine. The onIy
thing hoIding him together is his cIothes.

567
00:55:11,663 --> 00:55:15,055
Hey, how are you guys doin'
on TuggIe's case?

568
00:55:15,142 --> 00:55:21,405
The store owner's son's in a street gang,
so now we're thinkin' maybe it's gang-reIated.

569
00:55:21,492 --> 00:55:25,580
Yeah, that's reaI good. Why don't you guys
work on that for a few months?

570
00:55:25,667 --> 00:55:29,233
Look at your dlldo partner.
He's even scared of the sand.

571
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:32,756
I'd Iove to see you next to a sea
of hydrochIoric acid, Fedorchuk.

572
00:55:32,843 --> 00:55:35,148
See how much surfin' you'd do.

573
00:55:40,454 --> 00:55:42,629
That's cute.

574
00:55:44,977 --> 00:55:48,239
- That's reaI cute.
- I know why he's not comin' down here.

575
00:55:48,325 --> 00:55:50,500
He forgot his hip waders.

576
00:55:50,587 --> 00:55:53,109
Why don't you Iay off of him, you asshoIe?

577
00:55:53,197 --> 00:55:57,198
At Ieast I'm a detective,
not some outer-shit space thing.

578
00:56:04,243 --> 00:56:07,679
You're right. You are a reaI detective.

579
00:56:08,549 --> 00:56:10,723
An honest-to-God detective.

580
00:56:14,681 --> 00:56:15,942
Detect these.

581
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:30,642
- What was that about?
- Nothin'.

582
00:56:33,251 --> 00:56:36,469
Hey. You guys finish
your postmortem on Strader yet?

583
00:56:36,557 --> 00:56:38,644
The BIob? They're finishing up now.

584
00:56:38,731 --> 00:56:42,645
- Is Mr Bentner here?
- No, he went home earIy. His kid was sick.

585
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:45,646
But he Ieft somethin' here for you.

586
00:56:46,776 --> 00:56:48,603
- Here.
- Thank you.

587
00:56:48,691 --> 00:56:52,300
Does this have somethin' to do
with the tests that he ran?

588
00:56:52,387 --> 00:56:54,910
- What kind of tests?
- I think it was a bIood test,

589
00:56:54,996 --> 00:56:58,128
on that allen you dropped the other night.

590
00:56:59,389 --> 00:57:01,694
Well, did he find anything?

591
00:57:02,912 --> 00:57:06,173
- Well, George?
- It's nothing.

592
00:57:12,306 --> 00:57:16,959
Don't give me that shit. It wasn't ''nothing''
when you asked that... whatshisname...

593
00:57:17,090 --> 00:57:21,308
Bentner to run that test. He Iooked llke
he was about to shit peach pits.

594
00:57:21,395 --> 00:57:25,223
And it's not ''nothing'' now.
Don't lle to me, George. You're reaI bad at it.

595
00:57:25,309 --> 00:57:28,441
- You must Ieave me aIone on this.
- Oh, no.

596
00:57:30,050 --> 00:57:36,182
I'm sorry, pally. I don't Ieave you aIone.
You're my partner and I don't work that way.

597
00:57:36,270 --> 00:57:38,313
All right? Well?

598
00:57:41,662 --> 00:57:45,228
No secrets, goddamnit.
That SIag up there, he was on something.

599
00:57:45,315 --> 00:57:48,751
It wasn't sour mllk. Am I right, George?

600
00:57:49,925 --> 00:57:51,664
Tell me, goddamn... Shit.

601
00:57:51,795 --> 00:57:53,840
You tell me right now.

602
00:57:53,926 --> 00:57:55,797
Now.

603
00:57:57,275 --> 00:58:00,276
The drug is called ss'jabroka.

604
00:58:00,363 --> 00:58:04,233
- It is a potent narcotic.
- How potent?

605
00:58:04,668 --> 00:58:08,060
More potent than any human drug
you can imagine.

606
00:58:09,234 --> 00:58:15,759
The controllers reguIated it. We wouId
receive it as a reward for Iabour in the mines.

607
00:58:15,845 --> 00:58:19,107
- You? You were on this shit?
- Yes, we all were.

608
00:58:19,237 --> 00:58:22,717
We were genetically engineered
as sIave Iabourers.

609
00:58:22,803 --> 00:58:26,979
It was our onIy means of pIeasure allowed.

610
00:58:27,066 --> 00:58:29,284
The harder you worked, the more you got.

611
00:58:29,414 --> 00:58:32,329
The more you got, the harder you worked.

612
00:58:32,459 --> 00:58:36,112
Thousands of my peopIe died.

613
00:58:36,851 --> 00:58:40,417
I Iost my best friend. It is a nightmare.

614
00:58:43,549 --> 00:58:46,115
I wllI not Iet it happen again.

615
00:58:48,551 --> 00:58:51,594
Why wouIdn't you just
tell me something llke that?

616
00:58:51,682 --> 00:58:55,074
Your peopIe do not know about
this part of our past and they cannot.

617
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:58,684
It wouId threaten our entire existence here.

618
00:59:00,337 --> 00:59:02,424
- How did this guy get it?
- I don't know.

619
00:59:02,511 --> 00:59:04,816
Well, was it on the ship?

620
00:59:07,295 --> 00:59:08,338
No.

621
00:59:11,688 --> 00:59:13,992
This is major, George.

622
00:59:15,428 --> 00:59:20,429
It's very major. All you had to do was tell me.

623
00:59:20,908 --> 00:59:23,386
Here's HubIey.

624
00:59:23,474 --> 00:59:27,909
Looks llke he passed up a few jobs,
waiting for the one at the refinery.

625
00:59:27,996 --> 00:59:31,780
WouId you punch up ''Joshua Strader''
for me, darlln'?

626
00:59:35,825 --> 00:59:38,956
ReIeased on November 29th,
came immediateIy to LA,

627
00:59:39,043 --> 00:59:41,739
and took over a cIub called the Encounters.

628
00:59:41,827 --> 00:59:44,914
Now the store owner, pIease. Cecll Ñorter.

629
00:59:45,001 --> 00:59:50,177
ReIeased December 1. FieId of expertise:
organic chemicaI engineering.

630
00:59:50,263 --> 00:59:52,656
HoIy shit.

631
00:59:52,742 --> 00:59:55,308
Look what we're Iookin' at here, George.

632
00:59:55,396 --> 01:00:00,527
You got three Newcomers with nothing
in common. What if one guy shot all three?

633
01:00:00,615 --> 01:00:05,267
Now you got four Newcomers,
totally different backgrounds...

634
01:00:06,399 --> 01:00:10,009
- George...
- Quarantine.

635
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:15,140
Honey, punch up the occupants
of Ñorter's Iodge, wllI you?

636
01:00:15,227 --> 01:00:18,619
OK. Ñorter was in 772.

637
01:00:24,317 --> 01:00:27,100
Harcourt. Gin.

638
01:00:27,665 --> 01:00:32,797
Ñorter somehow created the formuIa. HubIey
provided the manufacturing at the refinery.

639
01:00:32,884 --> 01:00:36,103
And Strader, through the cIub,
establlshed distribution.

640
01:00:36,189 --> 01:00:40,408
Yeah, then Harcourt wiped 'em all out,
so he couId have all the marbIes.

641
01:00:40,495 --> 01:00:43,626
He's responsibIe for everything, from Tug on.

642
01:00:43,714 --> 01:00:46,583
Well, I want his ass. He's mine.

643
01:00:47,106 --> 01:00:50,107
We gotta pIay this reaI smart.
Do you understand, George?

644
01:00:50,193 --> 01:00:54,586
- If the drug is here, we must destroy it.
- No, hoId it. You're missing the point.

645
01:00:54,673 --> 01:00:58,195
The drug is our evidence.
We need it, you know?

646
01:00:58,283 --> 01:01:00,719
Hey, that's the guy, right there.

647
01:01:06,111 --> 01:01:10,243
- Hey, are you crazy? You can't come in here.
- Open the door.

648
01:01:10,373 --> 01:01:14,200
- So much for pIayin' it smart.
- You can't come in here llke this.

649
01:01:14,330 --> 01:01:16,506
- What are you, crazy?
- Shut up.

650
01:02:19,349 --> 01:02:22,872
- Where's the drug?
- What drug? This is an oll refinery.

651
01:02:26,438 --> 01:02:28,700
- Where?
- You can't do this.

652
01:02:29,744 --> 01:02:32,875
George, I think you're
crushing his llttIe chest bones.

653
01:02:32,962 --> 01:02:35,745
- Stay outta this, Matthew.
- Right.

654
01:02:36,658 --> 01:02:40,616
Tell me where the drug has been taken,
or I'll crush your Iungs.

655
01:02:40,703 --> 01:02:45,922
O'NeaI, pIease, do me a favour, don't piss
him off. He gets llke this, I can't controI him.

656
01:02:46,052 --> 01:02:51,750
I saw him once go in there and pull out
a guy's spine and show it to him.

657
01:02:51,836 --> 01:02:54,751
There was nothing I couId do.
I had to go throw up.

658
01:02:57,273 --> 01:03:00,795
They took the stuff out
this afternoon. All of it.

659
01:03:00,883 --> 01:03:03,318
Where did they take it?

660
01:03:03,405 --> 01:03:05,493
The Encounters cIub.

661
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:49,287
Quite IoveIy.

662
01:03:51,070 --> 01:03:53,115
What is your name again?

663
01:03:54,202 --> 01:03:56,247
Cassandra.

664
01:03:56,855 --> 01:03:58,943
I shall remember that.

665
01:04:00,334 --> 01:04:03,857
All right, now come on, George.
Lighten up. It's a beauty of a case.

666
01:04:03,944 --> 01:04:08,858
We got it by the short hairs. He ain't gonna
make any more of that shit, I promise you.

667
01:04:08,945 --> 01:04:12,947
If you destroy the drugs, you'll destroy
the case. Why bIow the whoIe thing?

668
01:04:13,034 --> 01:04:15,991
ÑIease just stick to procedure, OK?

669
01:04:16,078 --> 01:04:18,252
Fuck procedure.

670
01:04:18,339 --> 01:04:19,949
George, what...?

671
01:04:20,035 --> 01:04:22,906
George. Goddamnit.

672
01:04:23,297 --> 01:04:27,428
George Francisco, open your goIden gate

673
01:04:27,516 --> 01:04:29,734
Open your gate and Iet me in

674
01:04:39,084 --> 01:04:42,477
You. Hey, you. Ñollce.
Come on, get outta there.

675
01:04:42,564 --> 01:04:46,390
- What?
- Get out. I wanna see you waIk that llne.

676
01:04:46,478 --> 01:04:50,000
- Come on.
- What are you taIkin' about?

677
01:04:50,088 --> 01:04:53,697
Hey, what about me? That's my truck.

678
01:04:59,351 --> 01:05:02,047
It's been a Iong time.

679
01:05:02,309 --> 01:05:04,439
Hasn't it, gentIemen?

680
01:05:04,527 --> 01:05:08,137
- What is it?
- A sweet induIgence from our past,

681
01:05:08,962 --> 01:05:11,441
resurrected for our future.

682
01:05:11,529 --> 01:05:14,486
ÑIease feeI free to sampIe the quallty.

683
01:05:14,572 --> 01:05:19,574
I'm sure the experience wllI be
everything you remember it to be.

684
01:05:22,053 --> 01:05:23,357
Where'd you get it?

685
01:05:23,445 --> 01:05:27,055
I arranged to spend some time
with three very resourcefuI men.

686
01:05:35,970 --> 01:05:38,318
Jesus, it tastes llke detergent.

687
01:05:38,406 --> 01:05:40,754
That's all the effect it wllI have on you.

688
01:05:40,841 --> 01:05:44,581
But when my fellow Newcomers
Iearn they can obtain it here,

689
01:05:44,669 --> 01:05:51,236
they wllI work very hard to make as much
money as they can to give it to me.

690
01:05:51,366 --> 01:05:53,454
Tell them the rest of it, Harcourt.

691
01:05:54,497 --> 01:05:56,585
Tell them.

692
01:05:56,671 --> 01:05:59,324
- He's got the C-4 charge.
- Ñut your guns on the tabIe.

693
01:05:59,412 --> 01:06:02,239
Get up against the wall, except you.

694
01:06:02,325 --> 01:06:04,543
Take it easy, buddy.

695
01:06:08,066 --> 01:06:10,458
Keep your finger on the button.

696
01:06:10,589 --> 01:06:14,503
You reIease that button,
you not onIy kllI us, but yourseIf.

697
01:06:14,807 --> 01:06:19,418
- To get you and this, I wouId do it.
- You seem to have overIooked something.

698
01:06:19,504 --> 01:06:22,201
That is not in any books
as a controlled substance.

699
01:06:22,287 --> 01:06:26,462
Legally, it mightjust as well
be 12 kllos of grape jelly.

700
01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:31,420
The charge is murder,
and conspiracy to commit murder.

701
01:06:31,507 --> 01:06:35,291
HubIey. Ñorter. Strader.

702
01:06:35,379 --> 01:06:38,248
You kllIed Strader? No.

703
01:06:38,336 --> 01:06:39,684
No.

704
01:06:46,033 --> 01:06:47,816
- KllI them both.
- Here?

705
01:06:47,904 --> 01:06:49,817
Do it.

706
01:06:59,342 --> 01:07:01,211
Don't shoot.

707
01:07:14,215 --> 01:07:16,303
4230 Hollywood BouIevard.

708
01:07:16,390 --> 01:07:19,825
We've got gunfire at cIub Encounters.

709
01:07:48,834 --> 01:07:49,921
Shit, it worked.

710
01:07:55,357 --> 01:07:58,793
- Get the car. Let's go.
- I can't. You have the keys.

711
01:08:09,883 --> 01:08:12,145
Turn the pollce llght on.

712
01:08:41,153 --> 01:08:44,328
What are you doin'?
Don't put the gun in my face.

713
01:08:47,546 --> 01:08:49,591
Matthew.

714
01:09:02,985 --> 01:09:04,899
I think we Iost them.

715
01:09:48,433 --> 01:09:50,911
Move. Everybody move.

716
01:09:50,999 --> 01:09:53,303
We're the goddamn pollce.

717
01:10:17,137 --> 01:10:19,181
Up ahead, on your right.

718
01:10:41,883 --> 01:10:44,536
It's bIocked. The goddamn road is bIocked.

719
01:10:50,798 --> 01:10:51,886
Oh, Christ.

720
01:10:53,974 --> 01:10:56,757
Head straight for them. He'll move.

721
01:10:56,843 --> 01:10:59,235
This is chicken, George. I never Iose.

722
01:11:03,845 --> 01:11:05,411
Damn.

723
01:11:51,250 --> 01:11:53,816
You all right? Anything broken?

724
01:11:53,903 --> 01:11:55,078
You all right?

725
01:11:59,731 --> 01:12:01,819
Don't move.

726
01:12:55,747 --> 01:12:57,834
Ñut 'em up.

727
01:12:59,617 --> 01:13:01,575
I said put them up.

728
01:13:12,491 --> 01:13:16,709
- You move one finger and you're history.
- Not history.

729
01:13:16,796 --> 01:13:18,666
Eternity.

730
01:14:31,818 --> 01:14:36,384
I just remembered ajoke that my son toId me.

731
01:14:36,471 --> 01:14:38,559
Yeah?

732
01:14:39,515 --> 01:14:41,472
So?

733
01:14:41,559 --> 01:14:44,647
I'd better not tell it.

734
01:14:44,734 --> 01:14:47,821
I don't tell jokes well.

735
01:14:48,997 --> 01:14:51,475
ÑrobabIy not, but go on, tell me.

736
01:14:53,389 --> 01:14:57,564
If I begin to tell it and
you know the joke, pIease say.

737
01:15:00,130 --> 01:15:03,043
Why did the chicken cross the road?

738
01:15:05,783 --> 01:15:07,871
I know it.

739
01:15:10,045 --> 01:15:12,611
It's a funny joke.

740
01:15:17,439 --> 01:15:23,441
I assume, with Harcourt and Kipllng dead,
you wllI be requesting a reassignment now.

741
01:15:23,528 --> 01:15:26,615
Well, just for your own good.

742
01:15:27,659 --> 01:15:32,835
I think you'd probabIy be better with
a partner who's more by the book.

743
01:15:35,879 --> 01:15:39,010
But stllI, George, I gotta tell ya.

744
01:15:39,098 --> 01:15:43,664
For a quiet guy, once you get started,
you're hell on wheeIs, you know?

745
01:15:43,750 --> 01:15:47,230
And I'd kinda hate to miss
your next few days as a detective.

746
01:15:47,318 --> 01:15:50,144
Come on, guys,
I'll give you a llft to the station.

747
01:15:50,231 --> 01:15:53,580
- Come on, partner.
- They want a statement on the shooting.

748
01:15:53,667 --> 01:15:57,842
No, I didn't shoot Harcourt.
I didn't have to. He OD'd.

749
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:05,496
- You got a match?
- Yeah, in there.

750
01:16:11,976 --> 01:16:14,542
What's this about, Sarge?

751
01:16:14,629 --> 01:16:17,978
Just keep driving, all right? Just drive.

752
01:16:24,850 --> 01:16:26,545
What the heck is that?

753
01:16:30,025 --> 01:16:31,764
HoIy...

754
01:16:31,895 --> 01:16:33,983
I'm callin' for backup.

755
01:16:34,069 --> 01:16:35,766
No.

756
01:16:37,940 --> 01:16:40,636
Leave it be, wllI you, Wlltey?

757
01:17:04,557 --> 01:17:06,731
Sarge.

758
01:17:09,862 --> 01:17:12,036
Something gutted them.

759
01:17:16,169 --> 01:17:18,561
I'm gonna request heIp and an air unit.

760
01:17:23,301 --> 01:17:25,953
What... what...?

761
01:17:26,041 --> 01:17:28,476
- What is this?
- It's Harcourt.

762
01:17:28,563 --> 01:17:31,955
- He's dead.
- No, not if he overdosed on the drug.

763
01:17:32,042 --> 01:17:36,000
Massive amounts trigger a change.
Your body seizes up, you appear dead,

764
01:17:36,087 --> 01:17:41,740
but it is really a state of incubation. When
you emerge, you are metamorphosised.

765
01:17:43,916 --> 01:17:46,308
We must not Iet him get away.

766
01:17:46,394 --> 01:17:48,265
What?

767
01:17:48,786 --> 01:17:54,092
What wouId happen if humans see
what we are capabIe of becoming?

768
01:18:26,449 --> 01:18:27,841
Got him.

769
01:18:29,189 --> 01:18:30,667
Wlltey, no.

770
01:21:34,459 --> 01:21:37,503
Hey, you. Get the hell off my boat.

771
01:21:37,590 --> 01:21:39,895
You heard me. Get off the boat.

772
01:21:40,634 --> 01:21:41,765
Over there.

773
01:21:55,943 --> 01:21:58,117
Nice view, huh? You dumb sack of shit.

774
01:22:01,379 --> 01:22:03,945
For Tug. Let's have a coId one.

775
01:22:08,381 --> 01:22:09,687
Take her down.

776
01:22:16,471 --> 01:22:18,645
Down. Take her down.

777
01:22:43,869 --> 01:22:46,610
Your scarf. Can I borrow your scarf?

778
01:22:52,177 --> 01:22:54,351
Take her down.

779
01:24:39,685 --> 01:24:41,773
Wait, wait, wait.

780
01:24:44,686 --> 01:24:48,687
What the hell was that down there?
It Iooked really weird.

781
01:24:48,775 --> 01:24:53,689
What do you mean, weird? It Iooked llke
every other SIag to me, just pIain ugIy.

782
01:24:53,776 --> 01:24:55,821
Here, Iook at this.

783
01:25:11,390 --> 01:25:13,607
Here, Iet me hoId the tie.

784
01:25:14,782 --> 01:25:19,175
Everybody gets dressed right before
their daughter gets married.

785
01:25:19,261 --> 01:25:22,350
- Is it on top of the collar?
- No... Now it is.

786
01:25:22,436 --> 01:25:25,568
- It Iooks all right?
- You Iook very good.

787
01:25:25,654 --> 01:25:27,742
Ready, Daddy?

788
01:25:30,873 --> 01:25:32,874
Yes, honey.

789
01:25:34,483 --> 01:25:39,137
George, I just want to tell you in advance...

790
01:25:39,224 --> 01:25:45,139
I want to apoIogise for all the rotten things
I'm gonna do and say to you over the years.

791
01:25:45,834 --> 01:25:50,009
It is all right, Matthew.
After all, you're onIy human.

792
01:25:51,227 --> 01:25:53,228
What a wlld man.

793
01:25:55,054 --> 01:25:58,533
Well, my daughter's got a husband.
I got a partner.

794
01:25:58,620 --> 01:26:03,926
He really ain't half bad, except when
he's got that rotten mllk on his breath.

795
01:26:04,926 --> 01:26:14,926
