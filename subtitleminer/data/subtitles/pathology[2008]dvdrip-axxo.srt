1
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,500
It's possible.

2
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,400
Get outta here.

3
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,700
Why, most women at one time or
another faked it.

4
00:00:37,735 --> 00:00:40,700
Well, they haven't faked it with me.

5
00:00:40,735 --> 00:00:44,700
Ohh, right right, I forgot,
you're a man.

6
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:49,100
You don't think that I could tell
the difference?

7
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,900
Oh, Ohh, Ohh...

8
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,500
Hey, you ok?

9
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:09,700
Oh, Ohh, Yes! Yes! Yes! Oh, Ohh...
Ohh, right there! Yes! Yes!

13
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,900
Ohh, Ohhh...

14
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,500
I want what she's having.
Yeah, we're going to hell.

15
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,200
Fuck me, please.

16
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,500
You're bad.
I'm gonna be late for my flight.

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,100
I don't care.

18
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,000
- I can not see you for three whole months.
- Don't be a baby.

19
00:01:58,035 --> 00:02:04,800
- I love you.
- Careful, I may just marry you and ruin your life.

20
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,300
You better...

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,100
Fine, go be with your...

22
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,600
dead people, Doctor.

23
00:02:16,635 --> 00:02:20,500
Figuring out how they die is gonna help people.

24
00:02:20,535 --> 00:02:23,000
Your hands are so cold.

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,800
Time's gonna feel like nothing ok.

26
00:02:29,835 --> 00:02:32,100
I miss you already.

27
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,900
- Love you.
- And I love you.

30
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,400
T..Ted Gray?

31
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,500
- Ben Stravinsky.
- I am. Ben Stravinsky.

32
00:03:54,535 --> 00:03:58,500
- Take it you'll be showing me around?
- Ted Gray, I'm all over it.

33
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,500
Here we are.

34
00:04:01,535 --> 00:04:05,500
County morgue. Ze real banana.

35
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,900
If you check out from any unnatural or

36
00:04:08,935 --> 00:04:12,900
unexplained cause within the city limits
will end up here.

37
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,500
As resident we get full access.

38
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,600
Ah right. This it Pathology Room No. 1.

39
00:04:25,635 --> 00:04:30,100
It's been pretty slow lately, but holiday season's
around the corner, it should hopefully pick up.

40
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,400
Certain people around here couldn't
possibly be anymore annoying.

41
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,600
Beg your pardon?

42
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,300
- Oh no.
- What?

43
00:04:46,335 --> 00:04:49,800
Some of these guys last year,
they decided that...

44
00:04:49,835 --> 00:04:53,300
...they were gonna be God's
gift to this place.

45
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,400
Hey, you have a girlfriend?

46
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
As pathologists, we'll learn
the nature of disease and its causes...

47
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:06,800
its processes, development, consequences.

48
00:05:06,835 --> 00:05:14,100
But far from more than that. I'd like to think that
the pathologists has offered a window to God if you will.

49
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,900
Now, it maybe said...

50
00:05:16,935 --> 00:05:22,400
the pathology is a study in all things
human, save for the soul of course.

51
00:05:22,435 --> 00:05:26,200
But it is in that particular branch of
pathology known as forensics

52
00:05:26,235 --> 00:05:29,900
that we will delve into what it means
to be inhuman.

53
00:05:29,935 --> 00:05:32,700
You will see the perversion...

54
00:05:32,735 --> 00:05:36,700
and the corruption of the flesh
by all means unnatural.

55
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,400
By violence.

56
00:05:38,435 --> 00:05:39,700
By toxins.

57
00:05:39,735 --> 00:05:41,100
By madness.

58
00:05:41,135 --> 00:05:45,100
And then we will work backwards,
always back...

59
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:52,000
To that original pristine design
to determine the offending cause of death.

60
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,100
Dr. Morris?

61
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,000
- Oh, you're...
- Hi.

62
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,200
Dr. Stravinsky, I want you
to hunt down Jake Gallo.

63
00:06:06,235 --> 00:06:08,700
Tell him, I want to see him chop-chop.

64
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:10,600
Yes sir.

65
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,300
Ahh... quite a pleasure.
I've heard a great deal about you.

66
00:06:14,335 --> 00:06:16,900
How was Africa?

67
00:06:16,935 --> 00:06:19,800
Was a challenge. Quite humbling though.

68
00:06:19,835 --> 00:06:23,400
- A very privileged year.
- Indeed.

69
00:06:23,435 --> 00:06:27,400
I spoke to your future father-in-law this morning,
he's quite proud of you, you know.

70
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,900
And Gwendolyn.

71
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,300
Have had the chance to see her
since you've been home?

72
00:06:34,335 --> 00:06:38,100
- Only briefly.
- Oh, that's a pity.

73
00:06:38,135 --> 00:06:41,700
I have known that girl since she was
barely out of braces.

74
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:44,400
She's become quite a woman.

75
00:06:44,435 --> 00:06:48,600
You are indeed privileged
and evidently quite talented.

76
00:06:48,835 --> 00:06:50,800
Dr. Morris.

77
00:06:50,835 --> 00:06:52,700
Dr. Gallo.

78
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:58,200
I would like you to meet Dr. Gray.

79
00:06:58,235 --> 00:07:01,000
Hello Doctor Gray.

80
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,300
Ted comes to us top of his class from Harvard.

81
00:07:04,335 --> 00:07:08,200
- Eighteen weeks at Bellview in New York city.
- Ohh, patient?

82
00:07:08,235 --> 00:07:13,900
Before being accepted in the UNICEF program in Legos,
where he has been for the past four months.

83
00:07:13,935 --> 00:07:17,900
Bleeding heart. I cut one of those
in half this morning.

84
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:22,300
Jake is our young... star in residents.

85
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,400
Single-handedly solved the Hordon family murders.

86
00:07:25,435 --> 00:07:30,800
If it weren't for a little student intership,
I think the FBI would still be fingering around.

87
00:07:30,835 --> 00:07:32,700
Damn.

88
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:39,100
I expect you two would get along quite well.

89
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,900
Doctors, this is a simple case of kidney failure.

90
00:07:43,935 --> 00:07:46,400
Blood in the urine, general swelling.

91
00:07:46,435 --> 00:07:49,800
Hey, look at his skin.
Looks like cheddar cheese.

92
00:07:49,835 --> 00:07:53,000
- Excuse me. Pardon my interject.
- By all means.

93
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:59,700
- He may interject?
- Given the boy's medical history, I believe
he died during a state of hypoxia and asthma attack.

94
00:07:59,735 --> 00:08:02,200
Fresh out of medical books.

95
00:08:02,235 --> 00:08:06,800
Oh forgive me, that seems more like a hypercondural
conclusion than an answer for the deceased.

96
00:08:06,835 --> 00:08:08,700
11 year old boy, overweight.

97
00:08:08,735 --> 00:08:12,600
This last report, Daniel stated he's
been ridiculed at school for his weight.

98
00:08:12,635 --> 00:08:18,100
The weight he started gaining when he began
taking Pediapred to treat an acute asthma condition.

100
00:08:18,135 --> 00:08:21,700
You'll gonna notice there's no trace
of the steroid in blood or bladder.

101
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:25,700
- Blah blah blah blah blah.
- Is there a problem?

102
00:08:25,735 --> 00:08:29,700
- Doctor please, continue.
- He stop taking the steroid.

103
00:08:29,735 --> 00:08:34,800
In his mind the abuse he suffered from his peers
for being fat was worse than the asthma itself.

105
00:08:34,835 --> 00:08:40,800
Finally during a field-trip to the zoo,
he died from a severe attack.

106
00:08:40,835 --> 00:08:44,800
One can't disregard psychology
when forming a diagnosis.

107
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,200
Ted Gray! Home Run!
No question about it. Acute asthma.

108
00:08:53,400 --> 00:09:01,000
Uhh... no.
I think it's coagulated nasal mucus.

109
00:09:01,335 --> 00:09:04,800
Death by booger.

110
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,000
Sorry man, I didn't see you there.

111
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:18,300
You wanted to know if there was a problem?

112
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:22,300
- There is one. We don't like you.
- That's not a problem.

113
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,400
Yeah, so I met Dr. Morris today.

114
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,900
I think the guy still has a crush on you

115
00:09:34,935 --> 00:09:36,000
or me.

116
00:09:36,035 --> 00:09:39,000
Can't be too sure.

117
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:43,300
Yeah, yeah I'm st.. of course I'm still excited.
The place is beautiful.

118
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,800
The school's beautiful, everything's beautiful.

119
00:09:46,835 --> 00:09:49,200
You're beautiful.

120
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,400
Hey, I gotta get up in four hours,
you're corrupting me.

121
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,200
Yeah, I love you too.
Bye.

122
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,800
Alright everybody, gather around.

123
00:10:18,935 --> 00:10:21,900
I want you to meet my friend Carl.

124
00:10:21,935 --> 00:10:24,300
- Hello Carl.
- Hey Carl.

125
00:10:24,335 --> 00:10:28,000
Now several weeks back, his doctors
recorded that Carl

126
00:10:28,035 --> 00:10:30,600
was experiencing frequent nauseous,

127
00:10:30,635 --> 00:10:36,000
discomfort while urinating, dizziness.
- You're describing my weekend.

128
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:40,000
His symptoms increased in severity until
Carl decided it's was time to pay us a visit.

129
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:47,100
Jesus. You killed him.

130
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,800
Oh ohh Jesus!

131
00:10:50,835 --> 00:10:53,300
Dr. Gray has quite nicely severed
the parametral tract.

132
00:10:53,335 --> 00:10:57,300
Disconnecting Carl's nerve from his brain,

133
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,000
which had momentarily forgotten it was dead.

134
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:07,900
A decidedly entertaining although unnecessary
display of skill. Thank you, young man.

135
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,300
- Dr. Gray. Dr. Gray.
- Ted.

136
00:11:13,335 --> 00:11:16,400
- Ted Gray
- Ben Stravinsky.

137
00:11:16,435 --> 00:11:19,500
That was pretty over the top today huh?

138
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,300
Yeah.

139
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:36,000
- I'm sorry, you were saying?
- Oh... no... the whole...

141
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:42,000
- Take care.
- No, yeah.. of course, of course.
It's just like pap... it's pretty cool.

142
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:17,100
This is what we like to call the food stand.

143
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,500
You guys haven't even got that cage open yet?

144
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,500
Why are we here?

145
00:12:31,535 --> 00:12:34,200
All of us. In here instead of out there.

146
00:12:34,235 --> 00:12:36,300
Why?

147
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,100
Because we prefer the company.

148
00:12:39,135 --> 00:12:42,100
This kind of company.

149
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,000
Am I right?

150
00:12:45,035 --> 00:12:46,400
Vernish.

151
00:12:46,435 --> 00:12:50,400
When I think about them, you know, out there...

152
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:58,300
...in their rooms, on the streets,
utilising public transportation...

153
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:03,500
...downloading pornography,
ordering their lives out of catalogs...

154
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,000
...shitting out processed foods,
cashing welfare checks...

155
00:13:07,035 --> 00:13:13,000
...opining, bitching, moaning, consuming, copulating...

156
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:17,100
...and multiplying.
It makes me sick.

157
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,400
What we need, brothers and sisters,
is less of them

158
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:25,000
and more of this.

159
00:13:25,035 --> 00:13:28,200
Don't you agree, Dr. Gray?

160
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:33,300
I can see your point,
not sure I agree.

161
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,900
Ah well, nobody's perfect.

162
00:13:39,935 --> 00:13:42,900
Not even you, Dr. Gallo.

163
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:51,700
- Ohh God!
- You don't wanna be cutting into the poop pipe, kid.

164
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,700
That stuff will kill you.

165
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:59,300
Well, we gotta go at some point right?

166
00:13:59,335 --> 00:14:05,300
In that case, wanna come and join us?
We're heading to Thirteen Stones.

167
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:14,100
Ohh... doctors' in.

168
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Mother fucker...
Fucking hurts man!

169
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,700
Alright.

170
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,200
Ah ahh...

171
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,800
- To the dead!
- To the dead!

172
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:52,900
Ok. Guys, let's play tell the truth.
Question.

173
00:14:52,935 --> 00:14:56,800
If you could kill anyone and get away with it,
who would you kill?

174
00:14:56,835 --> 00:14:59,700
The guy who invented condoms.

175
00:14:59,735 --> 00:15:01,300
Fuck that guy.

176
00:15:01,335 --> 00:15:04,900
- Griffin.
- I don't know.

177
00:15:04,935 --> 00:15:07,600
C'mon it's an easy quesiton, Griff.

178
00:15:07,635 --> 00:15:11,600
- You maybe.
- Oh I'm sorry, did you want to fuck me that bad?

179
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,500
Just your skull.

180
00:15:14,535 --> 00:15:18,500
Trust me Dr. Cavenaugh,
it's not as good as it looks.

181
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:26,400
I am interested in what Dr. Gray has to say.

182
00:15:26,435 --> 00:15:29,000
Yeah, c'mon Teddy.

183
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:35,000
You guys want the truth or something clever?

184
00:15:35,035 --> 00:15:39,000
- The truth.
- Just something clever.

185
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,000
Truth is ya'll full of shit.

186
00:15:43,035 --> 00:15:45,000
Well go on, elaborate.

187
00:15:45,035 --> 00:15:49,300
I mean, who needs motif, who needs a reason to kill.

188
00:15:49,335 --> 00:15:51,800
Just today, Jake, you opened a 16 year old boy

189
00:15:51,835 --> 00:15:54,900
who was shot in the stomach
because somebody wanted his fucking Ipod.

190
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,200
What kind of reason is that?

191
00:15:57,235 --> 00:16:02,400
We're animals. It's in our nature to kill.
Basic, simple.

192
00:16:02,435 --> 00:16:04,900
You should've all figured that out by now.

193
00:16:04,935 --> 00:16:09,000
And of course, if we were civilized or socialized,
we'll be seating around talking about it over a beer,

194
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:12,000
we don't actually do it.

195
00:16:12,035 --> 00:16:14,200
But could we really get away with it?

196
00:16:14,235 --> 00:16:19,200
To kill anyone? Anyone at all?

197
00:16:19,235 --> 00:16:25,200
Would you kill anyone? Anyone at all?

198
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:31,200
Good show! Now that's a man after my own heart.

199
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,600
Griff, waddaya say we get some shots?

200
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,300
I wonder about you.

201
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,400
Quit flirting with Teddy, we have to go soon.

202
00:16:48,435 --> 00:16:51,500
Go play with the boys.

203
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,500
So, where're you from?

204
00:16:58,535 --> 00:17:02,500
Where am I from?
Maybe we should just get past that.

205
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,600
Ok.

206
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:13,100
Drink up. We're outta here.

207
00:17:13,135 --> 00:17:15,300
Where're we goin?

208
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:17,900
Oh no, not we.

209
00:17:17,935 --> 00:17:22,200
- We. You can take a cab.
- Cool.

210
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,200
I'm sorry man.

211
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:38,300
Aww, don't be hurt.
Have another beer.

212
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,700
Tomorrow night, just you and me.

213
00:17:44,735 --> 00:17:46,200
Oh yeah? Doing what?

214
00:17:46,235 --> 00:17:49,600
Nothing too exciting.

215
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,000
- W..Watch out!
- Whoaa!

216
00:17:59,035 --> 00:18:03,100
- What the f...?
- That guy was in my fucking lane.

217
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:08,000
Hello!
It's dead.

218
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:11,800
C'mon, I want you to see something.

219
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:19,000
- Fuck!
- Shhh...

220
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,100
How many?

221
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,700
How many do you see?

222
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,300
- One fitty.
- Fitty?

223
00:18:40,335 --> 00:18:42,900
One fitty!

224
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:52,800
Look bro, here's 80 bucks.
Last in to walk and talk.

225
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,900
Watch your step!

226
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,200
Hey, how's the herb?

227
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,000
You nervous?

228
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:28,200
No, but I think it's staying in my pants.

229
00:19:28,235 --> 00:19:30,800
You sure about that?

230
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,900
Hey sport!

231
00:19:33,935 --> 00:19:35,600
Shit!

232
00:19:35,635 --> 00:19:38,100
Is this for real?

233
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,100
Hey sexy!

234
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,800
Fuck!

235
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:49,700
This is an illustration Dr. Gray
of why I hate doing it.

236
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:54,500
- This is fucked up man.
- Yeah, you think?

237
00:19:54,535 --> 00:19:56,300
Ok, get me the fuck outta here!

238
00:19:56,335 --> 00:19:59,300
- You sure? I mean we're already paid up.

239
00:19:59,335 --> 00:20:01,700
Ok, let's go!

240
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:25,800
I want you all to work closely
with me on this one.

241
00:20:25,835 --> 00:20:27,700
Sorry.

242
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,900
You smell like a liquor cabinet.

243
00:20:31,935 --> 00:20:35,600
Doctor Bentwood, will you do the honour?

244
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:38,000
Harper Johnson, 40.

245
00:20:38,035 --> 00:20:42,000
Convicted murderer, recently paroled,
subject was found...

246
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,100
One fitty!

247
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,800
I have to go out.

248
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:55,800
Forget to use the little boy's room, Dr. Gray?

249
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:26,200
All the blood tests are negative.

250
00:21:26,235 --> 00:21:31,200
Alright, we have four scenarios running.
We have to narrow this down.

251
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,800
You want to present first?

252
00:21:33,835 --> 00:21:36,000
Sure!

253
00:21:36,035 --> 00:21:40,000
Simple assignment.
The subject was stabbed, excessively.

254
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:44,300
A minor struggle ensued, and he was shot
at the back of the head.

255
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,000
Cause of the death,
a gunshot wound to the brain.

256
00:21:47,035 --> 00:21:52,900
The lack of blood from the head and the gradations of color
from the toraxic cavity of the neck, would tell us otherwise.

257
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
He would've lost too much blood to live
by the time he was shot in the head.

258
00:21:57,035 --> 00:22:00,300
I think it was a mark, like a gang sign.

259
00:22:00,335 --> 00:22:03,600
They probably watched him die
and then shot him.

260
00:22:03,635 --> 00:22:05,400
Exsanguination via stab wounds.

261
00:22:05,435 --> 00:22:09,100
Alright, let's discuss the trauma
on the left side of the head.

262
00:22:09,135 --> 00:22:10,600
Any information of the meninges?

263
00:22:10,635 --> 00:22:13,600
It's a domino effect in a trauma
of a gunshot wound.

264
00:22:13,635 --> 00:22:16,400
I don't think so.

265
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:20,700
You wouldn't find any information
after a fatal wound like this.

266
00:22:20,735 --> 00:22:23,700
The subject was obviously struck in the head
on the left side with a bat or kick

267
00:22:23,735 --> 00:22:26,100
or one hell of a hard punch.

268
00:22:26,135 --> 00:22:31,700
Look, there's a left epidural hematoma which caused injury
to the right temporal lobe from shifting in the skull.

269
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,000
This could've happened in the original confrontation.

270
00:22:36,035 --> 00:22:40,000
What concerns me more, is this discoloration.

271
00:22:40,035 --> 00:22:42,100
Well the blood tests did negative.

272
00:22:42,135 --> 00:22:44,800
Well, a solution of potassium cyanide,
will leave no trace in the blood

273
00:22:44,835 --> 00:22:48,800
or organ tissue sample detectable by standard tests.

274
00:22:48,835 --> 00:22:53,000
Besides the stains on Harper's clothes were 70% plasma.

275
00:22:53,035 --> 00:22:57,000
Most of the blood began coagulation
before exsanguination.

276
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,400
So whether he was moved or not...

277
00:22:59,435 --> 00:23:03,400
majority of the blood remains in the body.

278
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,500
I say we run a post-mortem Chem-7 on his major organs

279
00:23:06,535 --> 00:23:09,200
to evaluate his potassium levels.

280
00:23:09,235 --> 00:23:10,700
You really think he was poisoned?

281
00:23:10,735 --> 00:23:17,000
Six to seven hours before cuts were made to his body
the gunshot, followed shortly after.

282
00:23:17,035 --> 00:23:22,000
You know there was actually gunpowder in the stab wounds.
Didn't anyone else notice?

283
00:23:22,035 --> 00:23:25,000
I agree with Ted.

284
00:23:25,035 --> 00:23:28,700
Signs of livor mortis, algor mortis, rigor mortis,
in the percede external wounds.

285
00:23:28,735 --> 00:23:34,000
It's possible that the poison was injected directly
into the heart, be it the left axle or subscapular regions

286
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:40,600
or the lungs, be it the intercostal spaces...
enabling the killer to use less of a solution.

287
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:46,700
This will allow it to go undetected while
still getting the job done.

288
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:50,200
Lemme get this straight...
Are you proposing

289
00:23:50,235 --> 00:23:53,500
that the man was poisoned with
potassium cyanide

290
00:23:53,535 --> 00:23:57,500
then the killer waited 7 hours,
stabbed him 18 times

291
00:23:57,535 --> 00:24:00,000
and then shot him in the back of the head?

292
00:24:00,035 --> 00:24:04,700
- I realise this is highly improbable.
- That's an understatement.

293
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:10,100
However, we will explore it.
I will order Chem-7 and we will re-convene.

294
00:24:10,135 --> 00:24:13,500
Ladies, gentlemen.

295
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:15,900
Nicely done. Might be onto something here.

296
00:24:15,935 --> 00:24:19,900
Hey, meet me here tonight, 9pm.

297
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,200
You truly have a gift Ted.

298
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Wh..What? You gonna bum-poke me?

299
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:02,600
- Let's go.
- You're late.

300
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:24,300
This's where you bring all your dates?

301
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:45,300
Now this wing is over a 100 years old. Obsolete.
If I'd, I'll tear it out and re-built it someday.

302
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:18,200
So, impress me.

303
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,500
You killed him.

304
00:26:20,535 --> 00:26:22,300
Maybe.

305
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,000
The point is, how?

306
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,600
That is this? A game?

307
00:26:26,635 --> 00:26:30,500
Exactly!
It's a game.

308
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,700
I don't fucking believe this.

309
00:26:32,735 --> 00:26:35,500
- C'mon get over it, will you.
- Get over it?

310
00:26:35,535 --> 00:26:39,300
There are 6.5 million people
in this city, Ted, trust me

311
00:26:39,335 --> 00:26:41,600
this asshole will not be missed.

312
00:26:41,635 --> 00:26:43,500
Really?

313
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:47,700
You can't say he didn't have it coming.
Right?

314
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,800
Yeah, he was not exactly a boy scout.
Is that what you want me to say?

315
00:26:50,835 --> 00:26:56,400
Not exactly a boy scout Ted,
he was irredeemable filth.

316
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,900
That was his grandmother, by the way.

317
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:06,600
But really, who needs a reason.

318
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:15,200
We're animals. It's our nature to kill.

319
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:19,100
Remember?

320
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:22,600
Why show me this?

321
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,800
I don't know, Ted.

322
00:27:24,835 --> 00:27:28,600
I thought the intellectual challenge
might be of interest to you.

323
00:27:28,635 --> 00:27:32,600
- Was I wrong?
- No. No, I find it extremely fucking interesting.

324
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,100
Good. So, what's your theory?

325
00:27:36,135 --> 00:27:38,200
I stay to my case.

326
00:27:38,235 --> 00:27:40,400
Potassium Cyanide?

327
00:27:40,435 --> 00:27:44,400
What are you? Some kind of serial killer?

328
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,500
Oh...

329
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:51,800
I obviously misjudged you.

330
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,500
Maybe you should just

331
00:27:56,535 --> 00:28:00,500
run along home before the others get here.

332
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,900
The others?

333
00:28:02,935 --> 00:28:06,900
Seriously man, get the fuck outta here.

334
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:30,000
- Yes?
- How do you know I won't tell?

335
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,000
Because there so happens to exist,

336
00:29:33,035 --> 00:29:37,600
distinct physical evidence putting you
at the crime scene at the time of death.

337
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:40,500
I know because I placed it there.

338
00:29:40,535 --> 00:29:46,500
And if I was amind to it I could prove with mathematical certainty
and beyond reasonable doubt that you were the one that did it.

339
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:50,600
But none of that really matters if
you're the boy I think you are.

340
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:55,900
You won't tell because
that would mean the game is over.

341
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:00,300
And you never got to play.

342
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I don't know if you've heard but we got
the results back on our black male. Negative.

343
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,000
I heard. I'm sorry sir.

344
00:30:15,035 --> 00:30:17,800
No, no, no, priviledged from time to time.

345
00:30:17,835 --> 00:30:22,000
- Interesting theory.
- Thank you.
- Well, carry on.

346
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,000
Teddy!

347
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,300
What're you doin here?

348
00:30:34,335 --> 00:30:41,100
It wasn't potassium cyanide because there was no ragged stippling
in the red blood cells. The blood was hypo or smaller.

349
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,900
It was nitric acid.

350
00:30:43,935 --> 00:30:46,400
You brought him a bottle. A gift.

351
00:30:46,435 --> 00:30:48,100
You shared a drink with him,
but you didn't drink.

352
00:30:48,135 --> 00:30:52,000
You mixed athenol and nitric acid with the alcohol.
Probably a flavor to alcohol

353
00:30:52,035 --> 00:30:55,000
to mask the bitter taste.

354
00:30:55,035 --> 00:31:00,200
Using a needle would've been too dangerous because any first
year fucking med student would know to look for the mark.

355
00:31:00,235 --> 00:31:03,900
You cut him up when he was still alive
but unconscious.

356
00:31:03,935 --> 00:31:05,600
So there was no struggle.

357
00:31:05,635 --> 00:31:07,200
Then you put him in the back of your truck,
drove him to fourth avenue

358
00:31:07,235 --> 00:31:11,700
and shot him in the back of the head.

359
00:31:11,735 --> 00:31:19,300
Mother fucker. Ah, you are good.

360
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:25,800
Hey, you wanna play the game, you gotta bring
something to the table. Comprendo?

361
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:19,900
So Jake told you about the game?

362
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,200
It's alright, you can say it.

363
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:32,100
So, are you in?

364
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,200
I don't know.

365
00:32:34,235 --> 00:32:36,100
- You know what you have to do, right?
- Yeah.

366
00:32:36,135 --> 00:32:39,200
I get the idea.

367
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:54,000
It's an interesting case.

368
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,000
You know it's always me that ends up with the dirt.
It's a waste of a goddamn ICU.

369
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,800
Mother fucker shoots his wife
and two kids, execution style

370
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,800
then he shoots himself in the throat

371
00:33:25,835 --> 00:33:29,000
two more in the stomach and
he still couldn't get it done.

372
00:33:29,035 --> 00:33:33,200
Double his morphine.
I'll check back in a couple of days.

373
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,100
- He's strapped in.
- Lot of pain.

374
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:45,700
He tried to pull out his wires.
He see devil soon I think.

375
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,500
- Oh my God, stop the bus. We need a doctor.
- Someone call 911.

376
00:34:06,535 --> 00:34:09,800
- Is anybody a doctor?
- Is she breathing?

377
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:33,100
- Teddy?
- Hey baby.
- You alright?

378
00:34:33,135 --> 00:34:35,400
Yeah, I'm great. I'm good.

379
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:42,400
- I got your message.
- You sounded like someone else.

380
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:46,800
Anyway, do you miss me?

381
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,100
Of course.

382
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:53,700
How's the work load goin?

383
00:34:53,735 --> 00:34:57,700
Actually that's one of the things
I wanted to talk to you about.

384
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,500
- It looks like next weekend...
- You're fucked?

385
00:35:01,535 --> 00:35:05,500
I'm sorry. There's this mob trial and...

386
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,800
I understand.

387
00:35:07,835 --> 00:35:11,800
Don't be rational, I'm gonna start crying
right here in the middle of the street.

388
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:17,100
Baby, to be honest, I have expected it.

389
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,000
Atleast there's Thanksgiving.

390
00:35:27,035 --> 00:35:30,200
Absolutely.

391
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:34,700
My parents are still expecting
us to stay with them.

392
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,800
Of course.

393
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,400
Are you sure it's alright?
Because it's not too late to change your mind.

394
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,300
It's too late.

395
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,200
How so?

396
00:35:52,235 --> 00:35:53,800
Yeah, no...

397
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:59,500
your parents are great.
It's beautiful there.

398
00:35:59,535 --> 00:36:02,200
We're gonna have the back house
to ourselves, right?

399
00:36:02,235 --> 00:36:04,200
That's true.

400
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:14,300
- Then it's settled.
- Ok then. I can't wait.

401
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:21,700
I'll call you tomorrow.

402
00:36:21,735 --> 00:36:23,300
I love you.

403
00:36:23,335 --> 00:36:24,600
You too.

404
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:36,600
I know exactly what you're thinking.

405
00:36:36,635 --> 00:36:40,600
You think you feel guilty but it's not that.
There's not such thing as guilt.

406
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,900
There's just the fear of getting caught.

407
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,400
It's the first day after,
so that fear's still fresh.

408
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:53,100
Your brain is all sick and twisted up.
You're paranoid everyone knows.

409
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:57,100
You fucked up, you're gonna lose everything.

410
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:01,800
You wanna throw-up but
there's nothing in your stomach.

411
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,800
You're not gonna sleep tonight.

412
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:13,000
You'll hit the bottom, you'll watch some TV, and look for
any news that they're on you, but there won't be any.

413
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:20,900
Tomorrow morning, you're gonna wake up and it's gonna
be the same world. Nothing has changed.

414
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,700
That fear, it will start to creep away and after a few days

415
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,100
you're gonna realise no one knows shit.

416
00:37:28,135 --> 00:37:32,100
That this whole bloody thing,
disadvantage to you, so cataclysmic

417
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:33,900
has somehow

418
00:37:33,935 --> 00:37:37,200
slipped beneath the notice of the world.

419
00:37:37,235 --> 00:37:38,800
And then...

420
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:42,100
you'll be a new man.

421
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,300
That sheet

422
00:38:00,335 --> 00:38:04,000
on which she embroiled fantails once

423
00:38:04,035 --> 00:38:08,000
spread it so as to cover her face

424
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:12,500
If her horny feet protrude,
they come to show how cold she is

425
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,300
and dumb.

426
00:38:15,335 --> 00:38:18,900
Let the lamp affix its beam.

427
00:38:18,935 --> 00:38:22,900
The only emperor, is the emperor of ice-cream.

428
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,400
How did you do it?

429
00:38:27,435 --> 00:38:29,900
Later.

430
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,500
Welcome.

431
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,700
I knew you had it in you.

432
00:40:28,735 --> 00:40:30,900
Had what in me?

433
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,500
C'mon, he was gonna die anyway.

434
00:40:35,535 --> 00:40:38,200
Yeah, we're all gonna die anyway.

435
00:40:38,235 --> 00:40:40,200
Fuck you!

436
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:03,100
So who is he?

437
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:17,000
Sort of this great man once. He never might know. He built
'em saved up from nothing. At one point he owned seven stores.

438
00:41:17,035 --> 00:41:24,100
He married his highschool sweetheart.
Started a family.

439
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,900
Didn't last long though.

440
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,000
She left him, took the kids.
His business ran down,

441
00:41:32,035 --> 00:41:35,300
he pissed away most of his money.

442
00:41:35,335 --> 00:41:37,600
Why did she leave?

443
00:41:37,635 --> 00:41:41,300
- The highschool sweetheart?
- Yeah.

444
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:47,200
I forgot to mention, he likes little girls.

445
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:52,900
In the worse way.
You wouldn't believe what he does to them.

446
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:02,000
He should've gone to jail but

447
00:42:02,035 --> 00:42:06,500
you know how it goes, right?
It's easier for everyone to say nothing.

448
00:42:06,535 --> 00:42:09,500
How do you know all this?

449
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:15,100
Because you never forget your first fuck.

450
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,400
He's my father.

451
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:31,400
I want you to help me.

452
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:36,700
Because it's my turn for the game.

453
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,300
- Doesn't seem like your type.
- No?

454
00:42:43,335 --> 00:42:46,900
Clearly not like the usual lost cause
from the tournament award.

455
00:42:46,935 --> 00:42:50,900
Oh he may had a few issues with
alcohol and tobacco.

456
00:42:50,935 --> 00:42:52,400
Don't we all.

457
00:42:52,435 --> 00:42:58,000
But for the most part, he seems to have been in
relatively good health for a man of his age.

458
00:42:58,035 --> 00:43:00,400
That is until you came along.

459
00:43:00,435 --> 00:43:04,400
Could you be anymore hot right now?

460
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,200
I wonder what came over you?

461
00:43:07,235 --> 00:43:10,600
It's as if he dropped his lungs
off the side of a building.

462
00:43:10,635 --> 00:43:13,200
Yet the rest of his organs are pristine.

463
00:43:13,235 --> 00:43:16,000
Donor material.

464
00:43:16,035 --> 00:43:18,500
- No signs of asphyxia.
- He didn't asphyxiate.

465
00:43:18,535 --> 00:43:20,200
How can you be so sure?

466
00:43:20,235 --> 00:43:27,500
Because I know what asphyxiation looks like, dummy!
And it don't turn your lungs to jelly.

467
00:43:27,535 --> 00:43:29,600
No.

468
00:43:29,635 --> 00:43:32,600
I was thinking more along the lines of frostbite.

469
00:43:32,635 --> 00:43:34,400
You're kidding.

470
00:43:34,435 --> 00:43:38,400
The epidermis is healthy,
save for a few batches of sun damage.

471
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,400
Are you suggesting that Juliette
locked him in a freezer?

472
00:43:42,435 --> 00:43:43,700
Because, I do not see it.

473
00:43:43,735 --> 00:43:47,700
You don't?
Well, I see it all quite clearly.

474
00:43:47,735 --> 00:43:50,600
This is some kind of bud baby.

475
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:54,900
This is really medical marijuana for free?

476
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:58,100
Well, I am in favor.

477
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:03,900
It's been proven to naturally alleviate pain.

478
00:44:03,935 --> 00:44:07,000
Why should anyone have to suffer, right daddy?

479
00:44:07,035 --> 00:44:09,600
Ain't that the truth.

480
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:12,100
That's your boyfriend huh?

481
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,200
What was it you said you was again?

482
00:44:24,235 --> 00:44:26,900
A General Practitioner.

483
00:44:26,935 --> 00:44:30,900
So you can prescribe this shit for me, legal?

484
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:35,400
Yeah, that's right.
Legal, beagle.

485
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,100
Where do I sign?

486
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:48,200
- No, let's do some whippets first.
- No shit!

487
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,400
You got a prescription for that too?

488
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:57,500
Who's first?

489
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:01,100
Thank you.

490
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:11,600
Med school has its perks huh?

491
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:42,600
Liquid Nitrogen.

492
00:45:42,635 --> 00:45:46,600
A mixture of chlorofluoro carbons,
nitrogen and a bit of free on my boy.

493
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:50,700
He died of anoxia.

494
00:45:50,735 --> 00:45:53,800
It wasn't just that he couldn't breathe,

495
00:45:53,835 --> 00:45:57,500
he couldn't adsorb the oxygen.

496
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:46,000
More challenging mystery is
how Miss Bath here

497
00:46:46,035 --> 00:46:48,000
forced a 340 pound man

498
00:46:48,035 --> 00:46:52,000
to ingest a canister of -75 degree air

499
00:46:52,035 --> 00:46:53,200
all by herself.

500
00:46:53,235 --> 00:46:56,900
She is a very charming girl.

501
00:46:56,935 --> 00:47:00,000
That's true.
She could convince almost anyone

502
00:47:00,035 --> 00:47:03,400
to do what she wanted them to.

503
00:47:03,435 --> 00:47:08,400
You know, one could almost see a
resemblance between the two of you.

504
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:13,600
But maybe that's just the temperature.

505
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:35,000
Question.

506
00:47:35,035 --> 00:47:37,000
Are you playing fair?

507
00:47:37,035 --> 00:47:40,000
Is there such a thing?

508
00:47:40,035 --> 00:47:41,400
No.

509
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:45,100
But don't you wanna know who's the best?

510
00:47:45,135 --> 00:47:47,800
Aren't you a bit curious?

511
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,800
- That was pretty good last night.
- No idea what you're talking about.

512
00:47:50,835 --> 00:47:52,565
Oh c'mon.

513
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:55,000
You don't expect me to believe that

514
00:47:55,035 --> 00:47:57,300
our little Juliette,
came up with that one on her own, do you?

515
00:47:57,335 --> 00:47:58,765
I've seen her work.

516
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,965
Oh no, maybe there's more to her
than you thought.

517
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,400
Mmm... No, I don't think so.
But maybe there's more to you.

518
00:48:04,435 --> 00:48:05,365
Me?

519
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:08,500
I'm an open book, Jake.

520
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:12,850
Priceless.

521
00:48:12,885 --> 00:48:15,500
I'll catch you later, Dr. Gray.

522
00:48:15,535 --> 00:48:17,400
Oh Teddy?

523
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:20,065
She didn't give you that whole routine

524
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:24,600
about how her father raped her
when she was a little lass, did she?

525
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:27,365
Oh... what an imagination.

526
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:30,100
No, her father is alive and well.

527
00:48:30,135 --> 00:48:32,765
Paid a visit just last month in fact.

528
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,800
Chairman of an obscenely profitable
banking institution.

529
00:48:36,835 --> 00:48:39,900
And a hell of a guy I might add.

530
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:42,300
A hell of a guy.

531
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:52,200
Hey...

532
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:55,400
Who was he?

533
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:58,800
Who was he?!

534
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:02,000
Anyone.

535
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:10,500
Don't fuck with me.

536
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:13,265
Doctors?

537
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:17,300
Let's have a look inside.

538
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,165
Cyanide Pill.

539
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,800
I love that band.

540
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:45,900
Thanks so much.

541
00:49:45,935 --> 00:49:47,165
Thank you.

542
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:50,800
You want a smoke?

543
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:56,300
As he inhales, he'd activates the vapors.

544
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,400
Ohh, genius!

545
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:02,000
It was genius!

546
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,000
You've been doing alot of urine work lately.
Good work.

547
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:58,300
My bad.

548
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:01,365
You switched his blood.

549
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,365
You found another patient

550
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:06,000
with an S.H.N.
Then you switched his blood to John Doe.

551
00:51:06,035 --> 00:51:08,500
Am I right?

552
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,100
Fuck you!

553
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:13,950
Dr. Gray?

554
00:51:13,985 --> 00:51:15,500
Sir.

555
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:25,600
Is there anything that you would
like to share with me?

556
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:31,200
I'm sorry. I don't quite follow, sir.

557
00:51:31,235 --> 00:51:33,065
No doubt.

558
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:36,700
Look, your work has been beyond
reproach exemplary.

559
00:51:36,735 --> 00:51:39,265
- But what concerns me...
- Thank you, sir.

560
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:43,300
What concerns me is your
extracurricular life.

561
00:51:43,335 --> 00:51:44,967
I'm sorry?

562
00:51:45,002 --> 00:51:46,565
C'mon!

563
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:49,465
It is obvious that you are using.

564
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:51,050
One can experiment from time to time,

565
00:51:51,085 --> 00:51:55,842
I mean, God knows I have done my share.

566
00:51:55,877 --> 00:51:59,200
You should know that I planned on
giving you my highest recommendation.

567
00:51:59,235 --> 00:52:01,700
I appreciate it, sir.

568
00:52:01,735 --> 00:52:03,600
No doubt.

569
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,565
What're gonna be doing for the holidays?

570
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:11,000
Actually I plan on spending it with
Gwen's family.

571
00:52:11,035 --> 00:52:12,065
That's good.

572
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:14,700
Opportunity to re-think your priorities.

573
00:52:14,735 --> 00:52:16,565
Yes, sir.

574
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:19,800
And a little time away from Dr. Gallo
wouldn't hurt either.

575
00:52:19,835 --> 00:52:22,500
No, it wouldn't.

576
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,365
Look...

577
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:33,000
I know you got it all worked out.

578
00:52:33,035 --> 00:52:35,600
The money, the family with means,

579
00:52:35,635 --> 00:52:37,265
pussy...

580
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:41,300
It would really be a shame if
you fucked it up.

581
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:47,200
Sir.

582
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:52,100
What's up with Morris?

583
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:54,500
Lonely.

584
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:01,800
C'mon, let's get the fuck outta here
and get a beer. C'mon.

585
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:18,300
- Hey, it's me. How are you?
- Hello.

586
00:53:18,335 --> 00:53:20,465
Oh Jesus!

587
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:24,465
- What're you doing here?
- Are you going somewhere?

588
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:27,500
I told you. I'm leaving town for the holiday.

589
00:53:27,535 --> 00:53:29,465
Right.

590
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:31,065
The fiancée.

591
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:33,300
So you're going through with that?

592
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:35,465
Why wouldn't I?

593
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:39,400
What about you and Jake?
Don't you have some sort of arrangement?

594
00:53:39,435 --> 00:53:43,200
Nobody owns anybody.

595
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:13,400
- Hey.
- Hi. How are you?

596
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:20,500
- You missed me.
- Of course. How could I go on s'long without you.

597
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:23,665
Look at you.

598
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:26,100
Baby, you're working too hard.

599
00:54:26,135 --> 00:54:27,265
Oh I'm ok.

600
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:30,300
Everything's ok now.

601
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:43,565
So?

602
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:46,500
I hear you're kicking ass
with the residency.

603
00:54:46,535 --> 00:54:48,467
It has been an experience.

604
00:54:48,502 --> 00:54:50,301
Quentin Morris is a good man.

605
00:54:50,336 --> 00:54:52,168
I never liked that fruitcake.

606
00:54:52,203 --> 00:54:53,451
He speaks pretty highly of you.

607
00:54:53,486 --> 00:54:56,700
Of course. Why wouldn't he?

608
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:01,865
Look Ted. Bottom line, this program is the right thing
for you right now. Let's me sell you to the brass.

609
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:04,300
Working for Acxicom D.C.

610
00:55:04,335 --> 00:55:07,100
it's as good as it gets.

611
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:09,665
Listen Ted.

612
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:13,700
This job withstand, whether you
and I liked it or not

613
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:17,800
- is what you have it.
- Thank you.

614
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:21,165
So what about Africa?

615
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,665
- Enjoy hunting yet?
- Hunting?

616
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:26,200
I would say hunting is alot better than the city.

617
00:55:26,235 --> 00:55:29,300
Attaboy, I think.

618
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,065
- Daddy.
- Hey honey.

619
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:35,200
- I'm stealing my fiancée back now.
- Uh oh.

620
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:19,250
So I have an early Christmas
present for you.

621
00:57:19,285 --> 00:57:22,200
Hey, can you just get it?

622
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:23,865
No.

623
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:26,350
It's better.

624
00:57:26,385 --> 00:57:28,765
Impossible.

625
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:32,300
I'm gonna come back with you.

626
00:57:32,335 --> 00:57:36,200
Not in two months from now.
But now.

627
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:43,100
I finished all my work and
I can fly back up to take the bar exam.

628
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:51,000
Hey, only if it's ok with you?

629
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:54,600
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

630
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:01,800
Sounds incredible.

631
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:04,900
You don't mind?

632
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:31,300
Wow look at this place.

633
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:35,800
I didn't know you were coming or
I would've cleaned up a bit.

634
00:58:35,835 --> 00:58:39,100
Baby, it's perfect.

635
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:53,000
Hey, so what're you gonna wear tonight?

636
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:58,600
Gwen?

637
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,100
What the fuck is this?

638
00:59:05,135 --> 00:59:07,165
Don't freak out.

639
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,750
I holding it for someone.
A resident.

640
00:59:09,785 --> 00:59:12,265
He's trying to kick it.
I'm helping him out.

641
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:16,000
- A resident?
- Baby, do I look like a twigger to you?

642
00:59:16,035 --> 00:59:20,300
- Why don't you throw it away?
- Because I ran out here in a flash to see you.

643
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,400
If you need help

644
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:28,050
now is the time to ask for it.

645
00:59:28,085 --> 00:59:31,800
I'm sorry you had to see this.

646
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,900
That is not mine.

647
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:41,300
- Look.
- I love you.

648
00:59:41,335 --> 00:59:44,300
I love you too.
Look... Hey, look at me.

649
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:50,200
I know that this is not the world
that we're used to, ok.

650
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:55,900
If we're gonna to that party,
we should probably get ready.

651
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:25,465
- Ben.
- Hey, how are ya?

652
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:29,500
- I want to introduce you to my fiancée, Gwen.
- Wow, the one and only huh.

653
01:00:29,535 --> 01:00:32,800
Well it's a pleasure. Yeah, I've been hearing
all about you from day one.

654
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:37,250
Oh well, you too. It's nice to meet you, Ben.

655
01:00:37,285 --> 01:00:40,500
- He's great huh?
- Yeah, he's a cute one.

656
01:00:40,535 --> 01:00:42,165
- Oh, this is Donnna.
- Hi!

657
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:45,700
- Hi, Donna. Oh I love your dress.
- Thank you.

658
01:00:45,735 --> 01:00:46,965
Oh look at this.

659
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,465
The prodigal son returns.

660
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:52,000
Ok, ok, we can go now.
It's ok.

661
01:00:52,035 --> 01:00:58,400
Stravinsky.
Stravinsky, you little turd.

662
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:01,665
Gwen, I'd like you to meet some
fellow residents of mine.

663
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:05,500
This is Dr. Jake Gallo and
Dr. Juliette Bath. Gwen Williamson.

664
01:01:05,535 --> 01:01:07,265
- Hi!
- Hi!

665
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:11,100
Has Ted told you about all
the people he's killed?

666
01:01:11,135 --> 01:01:14,267
Yes. I hear he cuts 'em up quite well.

667
01:01:14,302 --> 01:01:17,065
- Well, he's learning.
- Yes, he's learning.

668
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:21,000
Practice makes perfect.
The wonderful thing about the death business

669
01:01:21,035 --> 01:01:25,665
- Never shortage of cliental?
- Yes Gwen, exactly. Exactly.

670
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:29,400
Blessful immunity from the sicklecal,
economic avenflow.

671
01:01:29,435 --> 01:01:30,965
You know, people just keep dying
and dying.

672
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:36,000
You mind if I straighten this a little tighter?
I cant...

673
01:01:36,035 --> 01:01:38,065
Are you a school teacher?

674
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:40,800
Eh, no, I'm doing my bar exams in February.

675
01:01:40,835 --> 01:01:44,065
Wow that's impressive.

676
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:46,965
You haven't killed any lawyers yet,
have you Ted?

677
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:50,200
Well, there's still so many.
It's hard to keep track.

678
01:01:50,235 --> 01:01:53,400
You know, I might've ended up a lawyer
if I hadn't passed my M-CATs.

679
01:01:53,435 --> 01:01:57,265
Oh that's too bad.
We might've been room-mates.

680
01:01:57,300 --> 01:02:00,065
Oh if you'll excuse us,
Dr. Morris would wanna see Gwen.

681
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:02,800
Oh yeah. You two have a great time.
I mean this is a party.

682
01:02:02,835 --> 01:02:06,800
You two enjoy yourselves. We'll be at
the trough assembling our meat plates!

683
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:11,200
Sorry about that.

684
01:02:11,235 --> 01:02:12,800
Was it him?

685
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:18,200
Very perceptive, counsellor.

686
01:02:18,235 --> 01:02:23,800
- I love you.
- Love you too. C'mon.

687
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:30,000
Dr. Morris.

688
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:32,400
- Hi!
- Hi!

689
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Well, you look very sexual.

690
01:02:35,035 --> 01:02:38,000
I mean alluring.

691
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:43,565
Are you fucking kidding me?
Huh?

692
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:52,900
- Don't fucking touch me.
- Oh what? Huh? You wanna fuck that guy?
You wanna fuck that guy? Go fuck that guy.

693
01:02:52,935 --> 01:02:54,065
Hey we got a fucking whore in the room!

694
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:57,000
Go fuck him.
Just remember your ass belongs to me.

695
01:02:57,035 --> 01:02:59,067
You don't fucking own me.

696
01:02:59,102 --> 01:03:02,200
Oh, I fucking do!

697
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:12,800
Fuck this!

698
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:28,500
Shit! I gotta take this.

699
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,200
Yeah?

700
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:36,800
What's goin on? Where're ya?
Ok, be right there.

701
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:42,765
I gotta go.

702
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:44,300
It's him, isn't it?

703
01:03:44,335 --> 01:03:46,400
I'm sorry.

704
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:50,400
I know. Becareful.

705
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:09,200
Teddy-boy!

706
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:11,600
Hello Jake.

707
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:23,800
Oh fuck!

708
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:28,065
Where're the others?

709
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:31,900
Those sick-pants! Fuck 'em!

710
01:04:31,935 --> 01:04:33,800
What happened?

711
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:39,600
Eh, simple transaction Teddy. I paid my money.
I got my money's worth.

712
01:04:39,635 --> 01:04:42,267
I got stabbed too.

713
01:04:42,302 --> 01:04:44,865
Good thing you're a doctor.

714
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:47,800
- We gotta clean this up!
- Clean this up?

715
01:04:47,835 --> 01:04:51,800
What? This? You wanna clean... like what?
Like this? Like this?

716
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:56,100
You're losing it, Dr. Gallo.

717
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:02,165
Losing it? Teddy!

718
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:06,200
Teddy, I just fucking found it!

719
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:13,800
This is it.
This... this is it.

720
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:16,265
Uh oh, who's that?

721
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:22,300
That's you. That's me. That's me.
Me. You. Me. You. Me. You're me.

722
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:26,400
You're fucking killer.

723
01:05:26,435 --> 01:05:29,200
You're fucking enemy.

724
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:38,065
Huh?
You fucking, fucking golden boy.

725
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:41,300
Playing ramsey with your
fucking eye-pleat cunt!

726
01:05:41,335 --> 01:05:43,700
She doesn't know you!

727
01:05:43,735 --> 01:05:45,800
I know you.

728
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:48,700
What about the game?

729
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:53,065
What about it?

730
01:05:53,100 --> 01:05:57,900
Is that why you called me here?
C'mon, let's play.

731
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:04,800
This woman here...

732
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:10,000
By the bubbles in her mouth,
I could see the subdued dire blood lost.

733
01:06:10,035 --> 01:06:12,665
She died of suffocation.

734
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:16,700
Precisely.
She choked on her own blood.

735
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:27,400
So you pocked this one bloodygade in the
temple with that pipe right there?

736
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:30,865
- A near fatal aneurism?
- What?

737
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:34,000
Of course you need to crack her head open
to know with mathematical certainty.

738
01:06:34,035 --> 01:06:38,400
Ermm, waddaya mean near fatal?

739
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:43,500
You disemboweled...
Probably while she's still alive.

740
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:46,000
There's blood on her right hand and
her wrist is broken.

741
01:06:46,035 --> 01:06:50,000
So I guess I know who stabbed you,
probably while gutting.

742
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:02,800
Bravo!

743
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:08,600
I failed to see the genius here.

744
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:11,400
You failed to see?

745
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:19,800
You failed to see?

746
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,400
Buzzkill.

747
01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:38,100
Let's go to the incinerator.

748
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,500
Hey!

749
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:59,500
What the fuck are you doing here?

750
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:01,265
'Coz I missed you.

751
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:04,100
Do you know where I just was?

752
01:08:04,135 --> 01:08:06,865
With Jake in the dungeon.

753
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:09,465
He went ape-shit and thrill
killed three women.

754
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:12,600
I'm done with Jake.

755
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:15,050
I think you should leave.

756
01:08:15,085 --> 01:08:18,200
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

757
01:08:21,700 --> 01:08:25,000
Your fiancée was really beautiful.

758
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:28,700
You must be very happy.

759
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:52,600
This is taken directly from
the center of the seminiferus tubulus.

760
01:09:52,635 --> 01:09:55,200
The mature sperm is showing
definite signs

761
01:09:55,235 --> 01:09:58,065
of structural abnormalities.

762
01:09:58,100 --> 01:10:01,500
Dr. Gallo?
You have a moment?

763
01:10:01,535 --> 01:10:06,600
Certainly Dr. Gray.
Excuse me.

764
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:14,165
I'm done. I'm out.

765
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:18,100
The words you're saying right now
are very dangerous.

766
01:10:18,135 --> 01:10:20,465
You should probably be more careful.

767
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:22,565
- Nobody gets out.
- Don't be so fucking dramatic, ok?

768
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:25,000
It's not like I can
say anything to anybody.

769
01:10:25,035 --> 01:10:26,517
I'm up to my eyeballs in this shit.

770
01:10:26,552 --> 01:10:29,965
Yes you are, Ted.

771
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:34,000
- I've got my fiancée.
- Oh yeah, your fiancée. That's right. Gwen?

772
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:37,265
Hey, maybe she should come down some night.

773
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:41,300
Hey, how about you don't mention her name again.

774
01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:52,900
I'm sorry. It's just...

775
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:56,050
You took me off guard last night.

776
01:10:56,085 --> 01:11:01,100
- Yeah, that was some crazy shit huh?
- Yeah.

777
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:06,065
You good then?

778
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:13,200
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.
- Good.

779
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:22,600
Hey, ermm, we have a meeting tomorrow night.

780
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:25,865
- Tomorrow?
- Yeah.

781
01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:28,765
That's right. You busy?

782
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:32,800
Good 'coz you won't wanna miss this one.

783
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:41,700
So I need to take off for a few hours flat.

784
01:12:41,735 --> 01:12:43,500
I know but

785
01:12:43,535 --> 01:12:45,700
I have to.

786
01:12:45,735 --> 01:12:52,000
- You don't have to.
- It'll be the last time, ok? I promise.

787
01:12:53,700 --> 01:13:00,500
- I believe you.
- You want one of these?

788
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:18,900
Here you are.

789
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:29,600
Whoa, we're contiguously short this evening.

790
01:13:29,635 --> 01:13:31,900
She's with him.

791
01:13:32,900 --> 01:13:34,300
No.

792
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:36,400
I don't think so.

793
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:41,600
I think it's time we get
rid of that cocksucker.

794
01:13:41,635 --> 01:13:44,900
- I concur.
- And her.

795
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:47,600
Yeah. Fuck yes, and her.

796
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:52,800
Well, if we're all in agreement,
let the lamp affix its beam.

797
01:14:10,900 --> 01:14:14,900
- What the fuck.
- What the fuck?

798
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:27,200
Alright, let's do this.

799
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:33,600
Doctors, let's have a look inside.

800
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:44,200
Oh I get it.

801
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:52,900
- What happened?
- Oh my God, you haven't heard?

802
01:15:52,935 --> 01:15:54,265
Heard what?

803
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:57,500
There was a fire here last night,
on the lower level.

804
01:15:57,535 --> 01:16:00,300
Some of our residents were killed.

805
01:16:00,335 --> 01:16:02,665
Who?

806
01:16:02,700 --> 01:16:05,665
Juliette Bath and Griffin Cavenaugh

807
01:16:05,700 --> 01:16:09,700
and there's two bodies yet to be identified.

808
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:13,900
Wait, you said two bodies?

809
01:16:13,935 --> 01:16:15,865
Unidentified.

810
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:19,100
- Plus Julieth Bath. Plus Griffin Cavenaugh.
- Right. That's right.

811
01:16:19,135 --> 01:16:21,367
Then there were four.

812
01:16:21,402 --> 01:16:23,600
Correct. Four.

813
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:28,400
- Look, I know that you're upset.
- Excuse me. I'm just gonna step outside.

814
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,400
Fuck!

815
01:17:15,700 --> 01:17:18,100
Hi, you remember me from the party?

816
01:17:18,135 --> 01:17:21,000
- It's Jake Gallo, isn't it?
- Yeah.

817
01:17:21,035 --> 01:17:23,917
Um, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

818
01:17:23,952 --> 01:17:27,800
- Ted already left.
- I know.

819
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:15,500
I just spoke to Inspector Vincent
from the homicide division.

820
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:19,800
He finds Jake Gallo's absence
to be quite suspicious.

821
01:19:20,700 --> 01:19:24,700
He also asked me if there was anyone who 
might be able to offer any insight or clues

822
01:19:24,900 --> 01:19:26,850
as to why one of my top doctors

823
01:19:26,885 --> 01:19:30,000
would have committed such an atrocity.

824
01:19:30,035 --> 01:19:32,067
I could think of no one.

825
01:19:32,102 --> 01:19:34,701
Can you think of anyone doctor?

826
01:19:34,736 --> 01:19:38,265
Several names come to mind
but since they're all individuals

827
01:19:38,300 --> 01:19:40,000
who were killed in the fire

828
01:19:40,035 --> 01:19:45,500
I suspect that questioning them
would prove fruitless.

829
01:19:46,900 --> 01:19:49,065
Concerning Gwendolyn.

830
01:19:49,100 --> 01:19:52,500
I can't tell you how devastated I was
when I got the news,

831
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:56,600
compounding what is already a tragedy
for the hospital.

832
01:19:56,635 --> 01:20:01,900
- I know that you loved her a great deal and I'm truly sorry.
- Thank you.

833
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:08,200
As for the cause of her death, I haven't been able
to come up with a firm conclusion.

834
01:20:08,235 --> 01:20:12,600
Based on my initial examination,
a full autopsy is gonna be necessary.

835
01:20:12,635 --> 01:20:13,967
I'm doing it.

836
01:20:14,002 --> 01:20:15,265
Excuse me?

837
01:20:15,300 --> 01:20:18,965
I don't want anyone else to touch her but me.

838
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:25,200
- You would have to get the parents' permission.
- I've already spoken to the Williamsons.
They gave me their full blessing.

839
01:20:25,235 --> 01:20:27,465
- I vehemently disapprove.
- Dr. Morris.

840
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:32,500
I urge you not to stand in the way of
the parents' wishes and my own.

841
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:38,100
Alright then. She's yours.

842
01:23:33,900 --> 01:23:37,900
- Dr. Gray, good night.
- Good night, David. Rajeeve.

843
01:24:10,900 --> 01:24:12,500
Well?

844
01:24:12,535 --> 01:24:14,065
Well?

845
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:18,700
I read something wildly amusing today.
Thought I'd share.

846
01:24:18,900 --> 01:24:21,200
Patient Name: Gwendolyn Marie Williamson.

847
01:24:21,235 --> 01:24:25,000
Age 28, eyes brown, blah blah blah blah blah.

848
01:24:25,035 --> 01:24:27,165
Ahh haha!

849
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:30,000
Conducting pathologist determines
cause of the death to be due to

850
01:24:30,035 --> 01:24:33,000
an arrhythmia of the heart!

851
01:24:33,035 --> 01:24:37,600
A direct consequence of
mitral valve prolapse?

852
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:42,400
- That's great shit huh?
- That's right. What the fuck do you care?

853
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:45,165
Because...

854
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:52,000
I have composed a poem sublime and you are my critic,
you are my only critic, Teddy.

855
01:24:52,100 --> 01:24:54,565
And have you read carefully 
your review of my work, 

856
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:59,100
my conclusion is that it sucks!
- Maybe it's just your clothes.

857
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:09,600
You know that this one was well above average.

858
01:25:09,635 --> 01:25:13,600
This one was fucking meticulous.

859
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:21,100
Oh shit...

860
01:25:24,100 --> 01:25:26,500
She never really knew you, did she?

861
01:25:26,535 --> 01:25:28,517
- My fiancée?
- Yeah, her.

862
01:25:28,552 --> 01:25:30,065
Just the good side.

863
01:25:30,100 --> 01:25:32,965
No, I didn't think so.

864
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:38,300
And there you were... oh boy!
Good little soldier

865
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:40,050
ready to march down the aisle.

866
01:25:40,085 --> 01:25:45,100
Fuck man. Fuck.
I did you a fucking favor huh?

867
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,100
You owe me.

868
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:50,565
By the way

869
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:52,550
Props to you for killing everyone.

870
01:25:52,585 --> 01:25:54,465
Oh yeah, sorry about that.

871
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:58,500
No, no, no, no, my bad.
I should've seen it coming.

872
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:03,000
It's in the past.
The important thing is, Teddy

873
01:26:03,035 --> 01:26:06,800
That in the end... in the end

874
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:09,200
I won!

875
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:10,565
How so?

876
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:14,600
Because I did one that you couldn't figure out.

877
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:17,800
I win!

878
01:26:22,900 --> 01:26:24,565
You like that?

879
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:26,100
I don't think so.

880
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:30,800
I think so.

881
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:35,265
Mitral valve prolapse bullshit!

882
01:26:35,300 --> 01:26:39,300
It's what I told the parents
so that they won't freak out.

883
01:26:39,900 --> 01:26:41,400
Aha?

884
01:26:41,700 --> 01:26:44,900
- I actually do have a theory.
- You have a theory?

885
01:26:44,935 --> 01:26:49,500
Alright. Impress me.

886
01:26:50,500 --> 01:26:51,865
Gwen made a fatal mistake

887
01:26:51,900 --> 01:26:56,900
trying to get back on you and when she did,
you covered her mouth with any of your soaked cloth.

888
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:05,400
You were careful not to
let her lose consciousness though.

889
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:07,265
After that

890
01:27:07,300 --> 01:27:11,300
you injected the potassium into the
basilica vein under her armpit

891
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,065
to help preserve the body

892
01:27:15,100 --> 01:27:18,900
before dripping nitroglycerin
on her tongue.

893
01:27:18,935 --> 01:27:24,400
And then, you slowly let her fade
into the after life.

894
01:27:29,100 --> 01:27:33,100
She took approximately 7 minutes,

895
01:27:33,400 --> 01:27:39,100
about the same amount of time it takes
for an average person to fall asleep.

896
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:44,600
She could hear everything
that you said to her.

897
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:49,700
The last thing she saw on this earth

898
01:27:49,735 --> 01:27:54,000
was your delightful face.

899
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:58,300
Time?

900
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:03,400
Six minutes, thirty seconds.

901
01:28:03,800 --> 01:28:06,000
29... 28...

902
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:10,200
Dr. Stravinsky?

903
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:15,600
Let's have a look inside.
