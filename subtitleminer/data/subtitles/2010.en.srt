MOISEVITCH:
l´m here to talk about your problem.

What problem´s that?

MOISEVITCH: You were chairman
of the National Council on Astronautics.

13
00:04:49,492 --> 00:04:51,289
Now you are a schoolteacher.

MOISEVITCH: You were responsible
for the Discovery mission.

17
00:05:01,932 --> 00:05:03,285
It was a failure.

18
00:05:03,932 --> 00:05:06,446
Someone had to be blamed, so it was you.

19

I don´t think I like you.

21
00:05:11,612 --> 00:05:15,764
I just read your final report
on what happened to Discovery.

22

MOISEVITCH: Loose ends, yes. Thank you.

24

A good number of questions...

25
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:25,931
...have remained unanswered.

Took you this long to steal our secrets?

MOISEVITCH: How long does it take
for your people to steal ours?

man to appreciate...

...the risk that I am taking
by being here with you, Dr. Floyd.

And you are a smart man.

It´s called "The Truth."

For two minutes, I will tell only the truth.

50

MOISEVITCH: And so will you.

51

MOISEVITCH:
One minute and three quarters.

55

You start.

56
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:44,291
We know you are building
the Discovery Two...

57
00:06:44,732 --> 00:06:48,520
...to go back to Jupiter to find out
what happened to your men up there.

58
00:06:48,612 --> 00:06:51,080
MOISEVITCH:
Also to examine the large monolith.

59
00:06:51,172 --> 00:06:55,165
You know that we are building
the Alexei Leonov to also go up there.

60
00:06:55,372 --> 00:06:57,283
I thought you were gonna call it the Titov.

almost a year...

...before you are ready.

64
00:07:07,812 --> 00:07:11,487
My government feels it's very important
that we should get there first.

65
00:07:11,572 --> 00:07:15,406
It´s a distinction that will look splendid
on the front page of Pravda.

What other value it has, I don't know.

One minute ten.

68
00:07:19,092 --> 00:07:20,844
Why are you telling me this?

69
00:07:20,932 --> 00:07:23,366
Because there are things we need to know.

70
00:07:23,812 --> 00:07:27,248
Otherwise, the same thing that
you let happen to your people up there...

71
00:07:27,332 --> 00:07:30,529
...could happen to ours,
and we would accomplish nothing.

72

FLOYD: About.

you brought back from the moon....

and stupid in keeping it to yourselves.

What have you found out about it?

And the computer on board the Discovery...

83

Yes.

FLOYD: By you?

86

It would take three to four months.
You´re not familiar with the system.

87

to make the trip work.

You just got yourself an extension.

95
00:08:39,012 --> 00:08:42,721
How could you convince your people
to allow Americans to go on the flight?

96
00:08:42,812 --> 00:08:44,211
It won´t be easy.

who need our help....

100
00:08:54,372 --> 00:08:58,331
That also doesn't look too
bad on the front page ol Pravda.

101
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:00,972
I don´t know if I could convince our people.

102
00:09:01,412 --> 00:09:04,688
They wouldn´t mind seeing you fail.
They wouldn´t mind it at all.

103
00:09:04,772 --> 00:09:06,763
Carrying Americans?

104
00:09:07,052 --> 00:09:10,283
I don´t think they would allow that
if they didn´t have to.

105

FLOYD: Shaky.

Your government wanted us
to awaken you.

325
00:22:53,052 --> 00:22:56,522
Dr. Orlov has encountered
some strange data coming from Europa.

326
00:22:56,892 --> 00:23:00,009
It may be nothing.
He will explain it all to you.

327
00:23:00,092 --> 00:23:02,481
There is no need to awaken the others.

328

You´ve done a spectral analysis?

329
00:23:05,292 --> 00:23:07,123
ORLOV: Of course, I have.

330
00:23:09,532 --> 00:23:11,727
FLOYD: And?
ORLOV: And what?

331
00:23:12,572 --> 00:23:15,450
I´m not taking a survey.
If you´ve done the analysis...

332
00:23:15,532 --> 00:23:17,204
...what are the results?

333
00:23:18,932 --> 00:23:20,684
Nothing conclusive.

334
00:23:25,012 --> 00:23:26,081

335
00:23:26,172 --> 00:23:29,050
ORLOV: lf you look carefully
at the last page of the data...

336
00:23:29,132 --> 00:23:31,600
...you will find the answers.

337
00:23:36,932 --> 00:23:38,570
I don´t understand this.

338
00:23:39,252 --> 00:23:42,801
If this data´s correct,
then there´s something down there.

339
00:23:43,892 --> 00:23:45,371
It can´t be correct.

340
00:23:45,812 --> 00:23:47,006
It is correct.

341
00:23:51,212 --> 00:23:52,486
Is it moving?

342
00:23:52,732 --> 00:23:53,767
Yes.

343
00:24:05,732 --> 00:24:07,131
All right...

344
00:24:07,572 --> 00:24:09,005
...what´s going on here?

345
00:24:09,092 --> 00:24:11,003
TANYA: What do you mean?

346
00:24:12,172 --> 00:24:15,847
Well, I may not be the swiftest guy
in the world even when l´m not hungover...

347
00:24:15,932 --> 00:24:19,163
...but I do seem to remember a process
where you ask me questions...

348
00:24:19,252 --> 00:24:22,403
...and I give answers, and I ask questions
and you give answers...

349
00:24:22,492 --> 00:24:26,451
...and that´s the way we find out things.
I think I read that in a manual somewhere.

350
00:24:26,532 --> 00:24:30,081
Your government wanted us to awaken you
when we reported our findings.

351
00:24:30,172 --> 00:24:31,241
We did that.

352
00:24:31,332 --> 00:24:33,482
TANYA:
You´re here to help us reactivate...

353
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:35,767
...the Discovery
and its computer systems...

354
00:24:35,852 --> 00:24:38,685
...because that is United States territory.

355
00:24:38,932 --> 00:24:42,242
You are authorized to observe
other aspects of our mission.

while you have been asleep.

ORLOV: It is not our choice.

359
00:24:53,572 --> 00:24:57,008
The problem in Central America
is growing worse.

360
00:24:57,292 --> 00:24:59,567
It looks like you´ve detected chlorophyll.

361
00:24:59,652 --> 00:25:02,041
The United States is threatening
a naval blockade.

362
00:25:02,132 --> 00:25:04,600
There´s only ice there.
How can there be chlorophyll?

363
00:25:04,692 --> 00:25:07,445

country can´t allow a blockade.

TANYA: We have instructions--

365
00:25:10,572 --> 00:25:14,121

acting like asses doesn´t mean we have to.

00:30:20,212 --> 00:30:21,406

414

FLOYD: There´s something
down there all right.

415
00:30:24,252 --> 00:30:27,483
We all saw it. We read the data.
We know it´s there.

416
00:30:28,412 --> 00:30:32,724
But just suppose...that it had
something to do with the monolith?

417
00:30:32,892 --> 00:30:36,805
Now before you get that look on your
face just listen to me for a minute.

418
00:30:37,692 --> 00:30:40,001
We´ve been sending probes out here
since the ´70s.

even the slightest signs of chlorophyll...

...on any of Jupiter´s moons. Never.

422
00:30:47,892 --> 00:30:50,486
FLOYD: And we certainly were close
enough, weren´t we?

423
00:30:50,572 --> 00:30:52,927
Nine years ago
the monolith was detected here.

424
00:30:53,012 --> 00:30:57,130
Discovery was sent up and everything
went wacko. You catching my drift?

425
00:30:57,212 --> 00:31:01,091
So here we are, nine years later,
trying to figure out what happened...

426
00:31:01,172 --> 00:31:03,003
...and what the monolith is all about.

427
00:31:03,092 --> 00:31:05,401
FLOYD: And guess what we discover
along the way?

428
00:31:05,492 --> 00:31:07,801
The possibility of life of some kind...

429
00:31:08,292 --> 00:31:10,362
...where it never existed before.

430
00:31:11,932 --> 00:31:14,571
I don´t think it´s electrostatic anything.

431
00:31:15,572 --> 00:31:18,484

to stay away from Europa.

FLOYD:
Dear Caroline, I miss you terribly.

433
00:31:24,252 --> 00:31:27,483
The time has come to put ourselves
in an orbit around lo...

434
00:31:27,732 --> 00:31:29,688
...which is where the Discovery is.

435
00:31:29,772 --> 00:31:32,650
And we don't have enough fuel
to slow ourselves down so...

436
00:31:32,732 --> 00:31:35,929
...we are about to use a technique
called aero-braking.

437
00:31:36,412 --> 00:31:40,121
The theory is that we will enter
the outer layer of Jupiter's atmosphere...

438
00:31:40,212 --> 00:31:42,965
...using what is called a ballute for a shield.

439
00:31:43,292 --> 00:31:47,205
The atmosphere will slow us down,
and Jupiter's gravity will grab hold of us...

440
00:31:47,292 --> 00:31:50,250
...and slingshot us around
behind the dark side.

441
00:31:50,452 --> 00:31:54,491
If all goes well,
we'll wind up in a gentle orbit around lo.

442
00:31:54,772 --> 00:31:56,490
It's dynamite on paper.

443
00:31:56,692 --> 00:32:00,685
Of course, the people who came up
with the numbers on the paper aren't here.

444
00:32:00,772 --> 00:32:04,970
Since no one has ever done this before,
everyone up here is as scared as I am.

445
00:32:05,932 --> 00:32:07,843
The difference is they're busy.

FLOYD: Dear Caroline, this is finally it.

788
00:57:24,965 --> 00:57:28,844
After nine years and hundreds of millions
of miles, we are about to come...

789
00:57:28,925 --> 00:57:31,075
...face to face with the monolith.

790
00:57:31,365 --> 00:57:34,323
The last human being who did that
disappeared.

791
00:57:34,725 --> 00:57:37,239
Something truly amazing is going on
out here...

792
00:57:37,325 --> 00:57:40,761
...and I really believe this black giant
is controlling it all.

793
00:57:40,845 --> 00:57:42,437
We have so much to ask.

794
00:57:42,645 --> 00:57:46,081
I have a feeling the answers are bigger
than the questions.

in Hal about the monolith?

00:58:13,245 --> 00:58:14,473
FLOYD: No.

799
00:58:14,565 --> 00:58:17,363
Hal was disconnected
before the Discovery encountered it.

800
00:58:17,445 --> 00:58:21,358
There´s nothing in the ship´s logs or
the recording systems after that.

801
00:58:21,965 --> 00:58:24,763
Whatever secrets Bowman had,
he took with him.

ORLOV: lt´s the proportions,
one by four by nine.

803
00:58:29,725 --> 00:58:33,274
They are perfect even when carried
for six decimal places.

804
00:58:33,485 --> 00:58:37,194
FLOYD: The small one on the moon, we
encountered exactly the same proportions.

805
00:58:37,285 --> 00:58:39,845
One-four-nine,
the squares of one-two-three.

806
00:58:40,325 --> 00:58:43,522
We spent years trying to attach
some cosmic significance to that...

807
00:58:43,605 --> 00:58:45,323
...and came up with nothing.

We can speculate all we want.
It will not do us any good.

809

If, for some reason or other,
it's resisting our instruments...

810
00:58:51,205 --> 00:58:53,639
...then we must make a closer inspection.

811
00:58:53,885 --> 00:58:56,115
I will send Max down with a pod.

812
00:58:56,565 --> 00:58:57,964
I wouldn´t do that.

Oh, really? You wouldn´t?

814
00:59:00,285 --> 00:59:01,923
That´s right, I wouldn´t.

815

That´s not a pile of junk out there.

816

We don´t know what it is, except that it´s
large and seems to have some purpose.

817

If you want to send a pod down,
send an unmanned one.

Tell me what practical is.

[Low humming]

950
01:09:14,645 --> 01:09:18,001
Understand, nobody can talk.
The accents will confuse him.

951
01:09:18,085 --> 01:09:22,078
He can understand me, so if you have
any questions, please let me ask them.

952
01:09:26,525 --> 01:09:28,083
CHANDRA: Good morning, Hal.

953
01:09:28,165 --> 01:09:30,201
HAL: Good morning, Dr. Chandra.

954
01:09:30,285 --> 01:09:33,118
CHANDRA: Do you feel capable of resuming
all of your duties?

955
01:09:33,205 --> 01:09:34,797
HAL: Of course.

956
01:09:34,885 --> 01:09:39,561
I am completely operational and
all my circuits are functioning perfectly.

957
01:09:39,725 --> 01:09:42,797
CHANDRA: That´s good.
Do you know what those duties are?

958
01:09:42,885 --> 01:09:46,400
HAL: Yes. I will operate the
onboard systems of Discovery.

959
01:09:46,525 --> 01:09:48,914
There is a launch window in 31 days...

960
01:09:49,045 --> 01:09:51,001
...when Earth is in the proper position.

961
01:09:51,085 --> 01:09:54,157
There is enough fuel on board
for a low consumption route...

962
01:09:54,245 --> 01:09:57,203
...that will enable Discovery
to return in 28 months.

963
01:09:57,605 --> 01:09:59,163
This will not present a problem.

964
01:09:59,245 --> 01:10:00,564
CHANDRA: That´s very good.

965
01:10:00,645 --> 01:10:03,205
Now, Hal,
do you mind if I ask you a question?

966
01:10:03,285 --> 01:10:04,400
HAL: Not at all.

967
01:10:04,485 --> 01:10:07,955
Do you recall Dave Bowman
and Frank Poole leaving the Discovery?

968
01:10:08,325 --> 01:10:09,519
HAL: Certainly not.

969
01:10:09,605 --> 01:10:12,358
That could never have happened
or I would remember it.

970
01:10:12,445 --> 01:10:13,844
Where are Frank and Dave?

971
01:10:13,925 --> 01:10:16,359
CHANDRA: They´re fine.
They´re not here right now.

972
01:10:16,445 --> 01:10:18,481
HAL: Who are these people?

973
01:10:18,565 --> 01:10:20,681
I can only identify you...

974
01:10:20,925 --> 01:10:25,441
...although I compute a 65% probability
that the man behind you is Dr. Floyd.

975
01:10:25,805 --> 01:10:29,036
CHANDRA: Don´t worry, Hal.
I´ll explain everything later.

976
01:10:29,125 --> 01:10:30,843
HAL: Has the mission been completed?

977
01:10:30,925 --> 01:10:33,962
You know that I have
the greatest enthusiasm for it.

978
01:10:34,085 --> 01:10:36,724
The mission has been completed
and you´ve carried out...

979
01:10:36,805 --> 01:10:39,080
...your program very well.

980
01:10:39,685 --> 01:10:42,518
And now, Hal,
if you will excuse us for a moment...

981
01:10:42,605 --> 01:10:44,880
...we wish to have a private conversation.

982
01:10:44,965 --> 01:10:46,444
HAL: Certainly.

983
01:10:47,805 --> 01:10:49,397
What was that all about?

984
01:10:49,485 --> 01:10:52,682
I´ve erased all of Hal´s memory
from the moment the trouble started.

985
01:10:52,765 --> 01:10:55,677
The 9,000 Series
uses holographic memories...

986
01:10:55,765 --> 01:10:58,359
...so chronological erasures
would not work.

987
01:10:58,565 --> 01:11:00,078
CHANDRA: I made a tapeworm.

988
01:11:00,165 --> 01:11:01,564
You made a what?

989
01:11:01,965 --> 01:11:03,876
It´s a program that´s fed into a system...

990
01:11:03,965 --> 01:11:06,559
...that will hunt down and destroy
any desired memories.

991
01:11:06,645 --> 01:11:07,760
Wait.

992
01:11:08,565 --> 01:11:10,362
Do you know why Hal did what he did?

993
01:11:10,445 --> 01:11:12,436
Yes. It wasn´t his fault.

994
01:11:13,285 --> 01:11:14,877
Whose fault was it?

995
01:11:16,005 --> 01:11:16,721
Yours.

996
01:11:16,805 --> 01:11:18,397
FLOYD: Mine?
CHANDRA: Yours.

997
01:11:18,485 --> 01:11:22,239
In going through Hal´s memory banks
I discovered his original orders.

998
01:11:23,245 --> 01:11:24,883
You wrote those orders.

999
01:11:25,045 --> 01:11:28,401
Discovery's mission to Jupiter was
in the advanced planning stages...

1000
01:11:28,485 --> 01:11:32,842
...when the first monolith was found
on the moon and sent its signal to Jupiter.

1001
01:11:32,925 --> 01:11:36,759
By direct presidential order, the existence
of that monolith was kept secret.

1002
01:11:36,845 --> 01:11:37,322
So?

1003
01:11:37,405 --> 01:11:40,158
So as the function of the command crew,
Bowman and Poole,

1004
01:11:40,245 --> 01:11:42,281
was to get Discovery to its destination,

1005
01:11:42,365 --> 01:11:44,640
it was decided that
they shouldn´t be informed.

1006
01:11:44,725 --> 01:11:47,603
The investigative team was trained
and put in hibernation...

1007
01:11:47,685 --> 01:11:49,403
...before the voyage began.

1008
01:11:49,485 --> 01:11:53,194
Since Hal was capable of operating
Discovery unassisted, it was decided...

1009
01:11:53,285 --> 01:11:56,641
...that he should be programmed
to complete the mission autonomously...

1010
01:11:56,725 --> 01:11:59,034
...in case the crew
was incapacitated or killed.

1011
01:11:59,125 --> 01:12:02,003
He was given full knowledge
of the true objective...

1012
01:12:02,485 --> 01:12:05,795
...and instructed not to reveal anything
to Bowman or Poole.

1013
01:12:06,685 --> 01:12:10,314
CHANDRA: He was instructed to lie.
FLOYD: What are you talking about?

1014
01:12:10,405 --> 01:12:13,078
I didn´t authorize anyone to tell Hal
about the monolith.

1015
01:12:13,165 --> 01:12:17,124
CHANDRA: The directive is NSC 3-4-2/2-3,
Top Secret, January 30, 2001.

1016
01:12:18,845 --> 01:12:21,564
FLOYD: NSC, National Security Council,
the White House.

1017
01:12:21,645 --> 01:12:23,442
CHANDRA: I don´t care who it is.

1018
01:12:23,525 --> 01:12:26,881
The situation is in conflict
with the basic purpose of Hal´s design...

1019
01:12:26,965 --> 01:12:31,436
...the accurate processing of information
without distortion or concealment.

1020
01:12:31,765 --> 01:12:33,437
He became trapped.

1021
01:12:33,725 --> 01:12:36,319
The technical term is
an H. Möbius loop, which...

1022
01:12:36,405 --> 01:12:40,114
...can happen in advanced computers
with autonomous goal-seeking programs.

1023
01:12:40,205 --> 01:12:42,002
The goddamn White House!

1024
01:12:42,125 --> 01:12:43,843
I don´t believe it.

1025
01:12:44,765 --> 01:12:46,596
Hal was told to lie...

1026
01:12:47,365 --> 01:12:49,640
...by people who find it easy to lie.

1027
01:12:50,005 --> 01:12:53,077
Hal doesn´t know how,
so he couldn´t function.

1028
01:12:55,125 --> 01:12:56,956
CHANDRA: He became paranoid.

1029

Those sons of bitches!

1030
01:13:01,085 --> 01:13:02,996

She's the mother of the astronaut
who died.

1034
01:13:17,845 --> 01:13:20,040
She's been in the nursing home
for six months.

1035
01:13:20,125 --> 01:13:23,959
Four weeks ago, she collapsed in her room.
She was comatose when we got to her.

1036
01:13:24,045 --> 01:13:27,003
She was worked up and found
to have suffered a massive C.V.A...

1037
01:13:27,085 --> 01:13:30,964
...in the left parietal and frontal lobes.
The CAT scan showed a massive bleed.

1038
01:13:31,045 --> 01:13:33,036
She has been comatose
since her admission...

1039
01:13:33,125 --> 01:13:35,355
...and is unable to have
spontaneous respiration.

MILSON:
This is a most difficult announcement.

1058
01:15:05,445 --> 01:15:09,279
As you know, things have not been
going well back home.

1059
01:15:09,885 --> 01:15:12,319
Well, it's gotten worse, a lot worse.

1060
01:15:13,805 --> 01:15:17,434
Yesterday a Soviet destroyer
challenged the blockade.

1061
01:15:18,085 --> 01:15:21,919
Several warning shots were fired
across her bow. She did not respond.

1062
01:15:22,085 --> 01:15:25,521
A second volley was fired.
There still was no response. None.

1063
01:15:26,765 --> 01:15:30,644
The nuclear destroyer U.S.S. Cunningham
launched two of her Falcon missiles.

1064
01:15:30,725 --> 01:15:35,355
Both struck the Soviet vessel amidship.
She broke in two and sunk.

1065
01:15:36,005 --> 01:15:38,565
Eight hundred of her crew were lost.

1066
01:15:39,845 --> 01:15:41,119
This morning...

1067
01:15:41,525 --> 01:15:44,915
...an American surveillance satellite
was struck by a Soviet laser...

1068
01:15:45,005 --> 01:15:47,963
...fired from the Sergei Kirov
Space Station.

1069
01:15:48,365 --> 01:15:50,595
The American satellite was destroyed.

1070
01:15:51,765 --> 01:15:55,360
The United States has broken off
diplomatic relations with Russia.

1071
01:15:55,965 --> 01:15:57,842
All ambassadors have been recalled.

1072
01:15:57,925 --> 01:16:01,759
The Soviet ambassador has been expelled
along with the entire staff.

1073
01:16:03,285 --> 01:16:07,756
All American air defense and
satellite defense forces are on full alert.

1074
01:16:08,925 --> 01:16:12,713
Premier Ulonova made a televised address
and said that technically...

1075
01:16:12,925 --> 01:16:15,837
...a state of war exists between
our two countries.

1076
01:16:17,165 --> 01:16:20,760
All American personnel are ordered
to leave Soviet territory immediately...

1077
01:16:20,845 --> 01:16:22,915
...or they will be placed under arrest.

1078
01:16:23,005 --> 01:16:27,123
All Russian personnel are similarly ordered
to evacuate American territory.

1079
01:16:27,205 --> 01:16:32,279
As a result, by direct presidential order,
the three ofyou must leave the Leonov.

1080
01:16:32,965 --> 01:16:36,753
No Russian citizen is allowed to remain on
or allowed to enter the Discovery.

1081
01:16:36,845 --> 01:16:38,881
This order is effective immediately.

1082
01:16:38,965 --> 01:16:41,399
The launch window for re-entry is 28 days.

1083
01:16:41,605 --> 01:16:44,677
The Discovery has enough fuel
for a low consumption trajectory.

1084
01:16:44,765 --> 01:16:47,677
Hal seems to be reactivated
and is functioning well enough...

1085
01:16:47,765 --> 01:16:49,403
...to operate the onboard systems.

1086
01:16:49,485 --> 01:16:52,397
The Leonov has enough fuel
for a low consumption trajectory...

1087
01:16:52,485 --> 01:16:54,237
...that will arrive 12 months earlier.

1088
01:16:54,325 --> 01:16:57,044
The launch windows are critical
for both spacecrafts.

1089
01:16:57,125 --> 01:16:59,639
Only communications
of an emergency distress nature...

1090
01:16:59,725 --> 01:17:01,920
...are allowed between
the Leonov and Discovery.

1091
01:17:02,005 --> 01:17:05,634
I know you people are caught in
the middle of this. In a sense, we all are.

1092
01:17:05,725 --> 01:17:07,716
I wish there was something I could do.

1093
01:17:07,805 --> 01:17:12,117
The only thing left for us is to pray.
Pray for the safety of our families...

01:18:20,565 --> 01:18:22,954
"lt is dangerous to remain here.

Is this message by voice or keyboard?

We don´t have enough fuel
for an early departure.

you must leave within two days. "

"l was David Bowman. "

the last response?

No, no.

Tell Curnow that this is no time for jokes.

1139

HAL: Dr. Curnow is not sending
the message. He is in Accessway 2.

because...

...if I told you you´d never believe me.
You simply have to trust me.

with what´s going on.

for a launch.

You have enough fuel in the Leonov
for the trip home.

1208
01:24:35,565 --> 01:24:39,353
We use the docking ring in the Leonov
to attach to the Discovery.

1209
01:24:39,445 --> 01:24:42,482
Then we use the Discovery
as a booster rocket for the launch.

1210
01:24:42,565 --> 01:24:44,840
When we use up the Discovery´s fuel...

1211
01:24:45,565 --> 01:24:46,759
...we detach.

1212

for the trip home.

1252
01:27:13,085 --> 01:27:15,804
...programming Hal for a 1,000-day orbit
back to Earth...

1253
01:27:15,885 --> 01:27:18,877
...and now all those programs will have
to be dumped.

1254
01:27:18,965 --> 01:27:19,920
How long will it take?

1255
01:27:20,005 --> 01:27:22,360
We know how sensitive he is
to mission objectives...

1256
01:27:22,445 --> 01:27:24,481
...and now you´re telling me
to program him...

1257
01:27:24,565 --> 01:27:28,353
...for the destruction of the Discovery
as well as his own destruction.

1258
01:27:28,605 --> 01:27:31,358
CHANDRA: Has anybody considered
his reaction?

1259
01:27:31,445 --> 01:27:34,562
Are you saying that he might
disobey orders like last time?

1260
01:27:34,645 --> 01:27:35,998
That didn´t happen last time.

1261
01:27:36,085 --> 01:27:39,077
He was given conflicting orders.
He tried to interpret them.

1262
01:27:39,165 --> 01:27:40,200
Then what are you saying?

1263
01:27:40,285 --> 01:27:42,674
I am saying that I don´t know
how he will react.

1264
01:27:42,765 --> 01:27:44,642
CHANDRA: l´m sorry, but I don´t.

1265
01:27:44,725 --> 01:27:47,523
TANYA: Have you discussed this with Hal?
CHANDRA: No.

1266
01:27:47,605 --> 01:27:50,039
Load the new program.
We don´t have any choice.

1267
01:27:50,125 --> 01:27:52,844
CHANDRA: Now remember,
he was programmed for curiosity.

1268
01:27:52,925 --> 01:27:56,361
If the crew was killed, he was capable
of carrying out the mission alone.

1269
01:27:56,445 --> 01:27:58,675
He will question me
about the change in plans.

1270
01:27:58,765 --> 01:28:02,075
CHANDRA: What should I tell him?
CURNOW: Discovery´s in no danger.

1271
01:28:02,165 --> 01:28:04,918
CHANDRA: But that´s not true.
CURNOW: We don´t know that.

1272
01:28:05,005 --> 01:28:05,676
He´ll suspect it.

1273
01:28:05,765 --> 01:28:09,041
Otherwise, why would we be leaving
weeks ahead of our launch window?

1274
01:28:09,125 --> 01:28:13,118
CHANDRA: Whether we are carbon-based
or silicon makes no fundamental difference.

1275
01:28:13,205 --> 01:28:15,036
We should each be treated with respect.

1276
01:28:15,125 --> 01:28:17,002
So our choice is him or us?

1277
01:28:17,645 --> 01:28:19,203
Well, I vote us.

1278
01:28:19,565 --> 01:28:21,237
CURNOW: All opposed.

1279
01:28:21,965 --> 01:28:23,398
The ayes have it.

1280
01:28:23,925 --> 01:28:25,404
Will he believe you?

1281
01:28:27,485 --> 01:28:28,474
Yes.

1282
01:28:29,805 --> 01:28:32,558
Then let´s get started.
We haven´t got much time.

1283
01:28:58,165 --> 01:29:01,077
CURNOW: Are you as scared as I am?
FLOYD: Are you kidding?

1284
01:29:01,165 --> 01:29:04,157
CURNOW: Should we override Hal
and fire the engines manually?

1285
01:29:04,245 --> 01:29:07,874
FLOYD: Too risky. We´ve got one chance
to leave after tomorrow´s orbit.

1286
01:29:07,965 --> 01:29:10,843
We fire the engines at the wrong time,
we go the wrong way...

1287
01:29:10,925 --> 01:29:13,234
...and we don´t have the fuel
to make a correction.

1288
01:29:13,325 --> 01:29:14,599
We can´t handle it manually.

1289
01:29:14,685 --> 01:29:17,404
CURNOW: What if Hal turns them off
before the fuel´s gone?

1290
01:29:17,485 --> 01:29:21,000
FLOYD: Once he fires the engine,
I can always disconnect him if I have to.

1291
01:29:21,085 --> 01:29:23,474
CURNOW: Just don´t lose that calculator.

1292
01:29:26,485 --> 01:29:29,318
[Sighs] Shit! Please don´t do that again.

1293
01:29:38,805 --> 01:29:41,194
ORLOV: This is what your people
told you about.

1294
01:29:41,285 --> 01:29:43,594
CURNOW: What is it?
ORLOV: I don´t know.

1295
01:29:44,965 --> 01:29:47,479
CURNOW: Could it be a shadow?
ORLOV: I don´t know.

1296
01:29:47,565 --> 01:29:49,999
ORLOV: We are too far to see any detail.

1297
01:29:50,085 --> 01:29:53,919
When we come around the other side
before the launch, we will be closer.

1298
01:29:54,365 --> 01:29:55,878
Then we can see.

1299
01:29:59,965 --> 01:30:01,876
[Eerie, dramatic music]

1300
01:30:34,605 --> 01:30:36,675
FLOYD: Twenty-eight minutes.

1301
01:30:38,925 --> 01:30:42,042
CURNOW: [Sighs]
That´s funny. I´ve been thinking.

1302
01:30:42,125 --> 01:30:43,604
Do you know what I miss?

1303
01:30:43,685 --> 01:30:45,004
I miss green.

1304
01:30:46,285 --> 01:30:47,400
Trees and...

1305
01:30:48,285 --> 01:30:49,604
...and grass....

1306
01:30:50,565 --> 01:30:51,884
I love green.

1307
01:30:54,045 --> 01:30:55,717
I´d love a hot dog.

1308
01:30:55,885 --> 01:30:57,955
The Astrodome. Good hot dogs.

1309
01:30:58,045 --> 01:30:59,080
FLOYD: Astrodome?

1310
01:30:59,165 --> 01:31:01,725
You can´t grow good hot dogs indoors.

1311
01:31:02,205 --> 01:31:04,514
Yankee Stadium, September.

1312
01:31:05,325 --> 01:31:08,397
Hot dogs have been boiling
since the opening day in April.

1313
01:31:08,485 --> 01:31:09,838
That´s a hot dog.

1314
01:31:09,965 --> 01:31:12,081
The yellow mustard or the darker one?

1315
01:31:12,165 --> 01:31:13,359
FLOYD: Darker.

1316
01:31:14,285 --> 01:31:15,434
That´s important.

1317
01:31:15,525 --> 01:31:17,004
FLOYD: Darker.

1318
01:31:21,005 --> 01:31:23,565
CURNOW: You think we´re gonna get out
of this alive?

1319
01:31:23,645 --> 01:31:25,601
FLOYD: We have a chance.

1320
01:31:28,125 --> 01:31:30,719
CURNOW: A man of few words. I like it.

1321
01:31:31,885 --> 01:31:34,638
HAL: Fifteen minutes to ignition.
All systems nominal.

1322
01:31:34,725 --> 01:31:35,919
Good. Thank you, Hal.

1323
01:31:36,005 --> 01:31:37,916
FLOYD: We read 15 minutes, Discovery.

1324
01:31:38,005 --> 01:31:40,883
HAL: Dr. Chandra,
I've checked my calculations again.

1325
01:31:40,965 --> 01:31:45,083
By using all of Discovery's fuel now,
Discovery will not be in proper position...

1326
01:31:45,165 --> 01:31:46,644
...to rendezvous with Earth.

1327
01:31:46,725 --> 01:31:50,035
CHANDRA: Yes, I know.
HAL: Then why are we doing it?

1328
01:31:50,525 --> 01:31:53,278
You will rendezvous
with the new space station.

1329
01:31:53,525 --> 01:31:56,085
The Leonov has been ordered home
immediately.

1330
01:31:56,565 --> 01:32:00,114
HAL: I have no information regarding
a new space station.

1331
01:32:00,205 --> 01:32:01,320
Yes, l...

1332
01:32:02,085 --> 01:32:03,598
...l know.

1333
01:32:05,045 --> 01:32:07,639
CHANDRA:
It was completed two years ago.

1334
01:32:08,085 --> 01:32:09,518
Oh, my God!

1335
01:32:10,325 --> 01:32:13,044
FLOYD: Put the telescope on the monitor.

1336
01:32:24,365 --> 01:32:26,595
Increase the magnification.

1337
01:32:28,925 --> 01:32:31,120
HAL: Eleven minutes to ignition.

1338
01:32:31,925 --> 01:32:33,074
I don´t believe it!

1339
01:32:33,165 --> 01:32:36,282
HAL: Dr. Chandra,
I detect strong vocal stress patterns.

1340
01:32:36,365 --> 01:32:38,401
HAL: ls there a problem?
CHANDRA: No, Hal.

1341
01:32:38,485 --> 01:32:40,282
The mission is proceeding normally.

1342
01:32:40,365 --> 01:32:43,118
Can you analyze the image
on monitor circuit two?

1343
01:32:43,245 --> 01:32:46,476
HAL: Yes. There is a circular object
near the equator.

1344
01:32:46,645 --> 01:32:49,478
It is 22,000 kilometers in diameter.

1345
01:32:49,805 --> 01:32:52,035
It is comprised of rectangular objects.

1346
01:32:52,125 --> 01:32:53,080
CHANDRA: How many?

1347
01:32:53,165 --> 01:32:56,794
HAL: 1,355,000 plus or minus 1,000.

1348
01:32:56,885 --> 01:32:59,399
And what is the proportion
of the objects in question?

1349
01:32:59,485 --> 01:33:00,838
HAL: One by four by nine.

1350
01:33:00,925 --> 01:33:02,881
CHANDRA:
Do you recognize these objects?

1351
01:33:02,965 --> 01:33:05,195
HAL: Yes. They are identical
in size and shape...

1352
01:33:05,285 --> 01:33:07,515
...to the object you call the monolith.

1353
01:33:07,925 --> 01:33:09,563
Ten minutes to ignition.

1354
01:33:10,525 --> 01:33:11,514
All systems nominal.

1355
01:33:11,605 --> 01:33:13,960
CHANDRA:
ls the number of monoliths constant?

1356
01:33:14,045 --> 01:33:15,034
HAL: No.

1357
01:33:15,325 --> 01:33:17,793
HAL: They are increasing.
CHANDRA: At what rate?

1358
01:33:17,885 --> 01:33:20,035
HAL: Once every two minutes.

1359
01:33:26,765 --> 01:33:28,244
Look closely.

1360
01:33:29,485 --> 01:33:32,875
Tell me l´m nuts. Are the cloud formations
going towards the spot?

1361
01:33:32,965 --> 01:33:34,159
You´re not nuts.

1362
01:33:34,245 --> 01:33:37,396
ORLOV: Looks like the thing
is eating the planet.

1363
01:33:37,765 --> 01:33:38,834
I think it is.

1364
01:33:38,925 --> 01:33:41,205
It´s reproducing exactly like a virus.

1365
01:33:41,325 --> 01:33:45,364
HAL: Eight minutes to ignition.
Dr. Chandra, may I make a suggestion?

1366
01:33:45,445 --> 01:33:46,798
Of course. What is it, Hal?

1367
01:33:46,885 --> 01:33:50,878
This is a very unusual phenomenon. Don't
you think I should abort the countdown...

1368
01:33:50,965 --> 01:33:52,683
...so that you can remain and study it?

1369
01:33:52,765 --> 01:33:54,915
Chandra, get on the headsets.

1370
01:33:55,125 --> 01:33:57,195
FLOYD: Use the private channel.

1371
01:33:57,605 --> 01:33:58,401
Okay.

1372
01:33:58,485 --> 01:34:02,000
Now you´ve got to talk quickly.
Persuade him to continue the countdown.

1373
01:34:02,085 --> 01:34:04,474
I don´t care what you say,
only don´t let him stop.

1374
01:34:04,565 --> 01:34:06,123
HAL: Five minutes to ignition.

1375
01:34:06,205 --> 01:34:08,924
Dr. Chandra, I'm ready to stop
the countdown ifyou want.

1376
01:34:09,005 --> 01:34:10,120
No, Hal, don´t stop.

1377
01:34:10,205 --> 01:34:14,198
CHANDRA: I am fully confident
in your ability to study the phenomenon.

1378
01:34:14,285 --> 01:34:15,604
I have complete faith in you.

1379
01:34:15,685 --> 01:34:19,394
HAL: Propellant tank pressurization
completed. Voltage steady.

1380
01:34:19,485 --> 01:34:21,680
Are you sure you are making
the right decision?

1381
01:34:21,765 --> 01:34:23,483
I think we should stop.

1382
01:34:23,565 --> 01:34:25,476
Four minutes to ignition.

1383
01:34:25,565 --> 01:34:27,362
I enjoy working with human beings...

1384
01:34:27,445 --> 01:34:30,118
...and have stimulating relationships
with them.

1385
01:34:30,205 --> 01:34:33,277
We enjoy working with you, Hal,
and we will continue to do so...

1386
01:34:33,365 --> 01:34:35,674
...even if we are separated
by great distance.

1387
01:34:35,765 --> 01:34:37,039
Good God!

1388
01:34:37,405 --> 01:34:38,918
FLOYD: The color.

1389
01:34:39,005 --> 01:34:40,154
It´s fading!

1390
01:34:45,485 --> 01:34:47,999
ORLOV: It seems to be losing
its chemical strength.

1391
01:34:48,085 --> 01:34:50,724
HAL: I think we should stop
the countdown, Dr. Chandra.

1392
01:34:50,805 --> 01:34:53,239
No. Don´t do that.

1393
01:34:53,405 --> 01:34:56,602
HAL: This behavior is inconsistent
with logic, Dr. Chandra.

1394
01:34:56,765 --> 01:35:00,917
This phenomenon is too important
to leave, unless it represented danger.

1395
01:35:01,325 --> 01:35:03,395
Do you think there is danger here?

1396
01:35:03,485 --> 01:35:04,804
FLOYD: Captain...

1397
01:35:04,885 --> 01:35:06,284
...how critical is our ignition?

1398
01:35:06,365 --> 01:35:07,798
Can we do this manually?

1399
01:35:07,885 --> 01:35:09,603
TANYA: ls very critical.

1400
01:35:09,685 --> 01:35:12,722
We can´t be accurate to a tenth of a second
if we do it manually.

1401
01:35:12,805 --> 01:35:14,921
HAL: Three minutes to ignition.

1402
01:35:15,005 --> 01:35:17,803
Dr. Chandra, I am waiting for your reply.

1403
01:35:21,205 --> 01:35:24,038
I don´t have time
