00:03:13,894 --> 00:03:16,010
It was summer 1948.

2
00:03:16,254 --> 00:03:17,653
And I needed money.

3
00:03:18,294 --> 00:03:22,207
After going door-to-door all day,
I was back again at Joppy's bar...

4
00:03:22,414 --> 00:03:25,724
... trying to figure out where
to look for work the next day.

5
00:03:26,214 --> 00:03:29,445
The newspapers was going on and on
about the city elections...

6
00:03:29,654 --> 00:03:32,293
... Iike they was really
gonna change somebody's life.

7
00:03:32,494 --> 00:03:36,692
My life had already changed
when I lost my job 3 weeks before.

8
00:03:36,894 --> 00:03:41,410
For example, one of the white guys
pulls a double shift.

9
00:03:41,694 --> 00:03:45,289
If he says he's too tired to work
overtime, you don't fire them.

10
00:03:45,654 --> 00:03:47,406
That's all you have to say?

11
00:03:56,574 --> 00:03:58,769
No, that's not all.
I need...

12
00:04:01,494 --> 00:04:04,611
I need to pay my mortgage and eat.

13
00:04:05,574 --> 00:04:09,567
I need a house to live in and
clothes on my back. I need the job.

14
00:04:10,294 --> 00:04:12,854
I'm sorry, fella,
I gotta get back to work.

15
00:04:16,614 --> 00:04:18,252
My name's not "fella."

16
00:04:20,294 --> 00:04:24,253
My name's not "fella."
My name is Ezekiel Rawlins.

17
00:04:25,094 --> 00:04:26,812
Catch you later, Joppy.

18
00:04:27,054 --> 00:04:30,012
Watch the marble, damn it!
What'd I tell you?

19
00:04:35,374 --> 00:04:38,252
How much you think they're paying
at Douglas Aircraft?

20
00:04:38,494 --> 00:04:39,722
I don't know.

21
00:05:07,014 --> 00:05:08,163
Come on over here.

22
00:05:08,654 --> 00:05:10,610
There's somebody I want you to meet.

23
00:05:14,894 --> 00:05:16,805
Come on, this is a friend of mine.

24
00:05:18,574 --> 00:05:20,644
Easy, this is Mr. Albright.

25
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:23,243
-Call me DeWitt, Easy.
-How you doing?

26
00:05:23,454 --> 00:05:24,523
Take a seat.

27
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,246
Mr. Albright and me...

28
00:05:30,494 --> 00:05:32,883
...go way back to before the war.

29
00:05:33,294 --> 00:05:35,808
Back when I was still
in the fight game.

30
00:05:36,094 --> 00:05:38,005
Ever seen this guy fight?

31
00:05:40,734 --> 00:05:44,090
Every time Joppy stepped in the ring,
you knew you would see...

32
00:05:44,294 --> 00:05:46,854
...some knockdown-dragout fisticuffs.

33
00:05:47,494 --> 00:05:49,724
-Where you from?
-Houston.

34
00:05:51,654 --> 00:05:53,292
Joppy's hometown.

35
00:05:57,374 --> 00:05:58,363
Need a job?

36
00:05:58,894 --> 00:06:01,010
Yeah. Easy always
trying to do better.

37
00:06:01,214 --> 00:06:06,049
Easy's one of a few coloured men
around here who owns his own house.

38
00:06:06,254 --> 00:06:09,485
He paying the mortgage every month,
just like y'all folks.

39
00:06:10,014 --> 00:06:11,493
Property owner, huh?

40
00:06:12,094 --> 00:06:14,289
These big companies don't give a damn.

41
00:06:14,494 --> 00:06:16,291
I got out of that racket long ago.

42
00:06:16,494 --> 00:06:20,692
If you need a job,
drop by this address, 7:00.

43
00:06:21,254 --> 00:06:22,243
Tonight.

44
00:06:22,494 --> 00:06:24,212
What kind of work you do?

45
00:06:26,774 --> 00:06:28,173
I do favours.

46
00:06:28,574 --> 00:06:30,405
I do favours for friends.

47
00:06:31,374 --> 00:06:32,523
Drop by.

48
00:06:37,094 --> 00:06:38,573
Who was that?

49
00:06:38,814 --> 00:06:40,884
Just somebody I know.
Businessman.

50
00:06:41,174 --> 00:06:43,324
-Businessman, huh?
-Yeah, he is.

51
00:06:45,174 --> 00:06:46,846
Ain't nothing to worry about.

52
00:06:47,614 --> 00:06:50,333
When I'm told there's
nothing to worry about...

53
00:06:50,574 --> 00:06:52,963
...l look to see if my fly is open.

54
00:06:54,054 --> 00:06:58,013
All the way home, all I thought about
was a chance to make some money.

55
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:03,606
I first came out to Los Angeles when
I got home from the war in Europe...

56
00:07:04,014 --> 00:07:06,812
... with $300 in my pocket
and the G.I. Bill.

57
00:07:07,174 --> 00:07:11,008
A lot of coloured folk from Texas
and Louisiana moved to California...

58
00:07:11,254 --> 00:07:14,849
... to get them goodjobs in
the shipyards and aircraft companies.

59
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:19,806
Now, me, myself, I was a machinist.

60
00:07:20,054 --> 00:07:24,206
And the first thing I did when I saved
enough money was to buy me a house.

61
00:07:26,094 --> 00:07:28,688
Man, I loved coming home to my house.

62
00:07:28,894 --> 00:07:29,804
I don't know.

63
00:07:30,014 --> 00:07:32,608
I guess maybe I just
loved owning something.

64
00:07:42,854 --> 00:07:46,051
-I'll knock down the trees in the back.
-Leave my trees alone.

65
00:07:46,254 --> 00:07:48,404
Leave my trees! Get on!

66
00:08:10,294 --> 00:08:12,808
I was feeling pretty
desperate that evening.

67
00:08:13,934 --> 00:08:16,607
In a week, I'd be 2 months
behind on my mortgage.

68
00:08:16,814 --> 00:08:18,884
And I wasn't about to lose my house.

69
00:08:19,094 --> 00:08:22,291
But a chill running up the back
of my neck was telling me...

70
00:08:22,494 --> 00:08:24,530
...l was about
to make a bad decision.

71
00:08:24,894 --> 00:08:27,362
Yeah, Albright made me nervous.

72
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:30,213
He reminded me of a fella
in Texas named Mouse.

73
00:08:30,654 --> 00:08:33,566
-Let's dump this thing.
-Isn't this your friend's car?

74
00:08:33,774 --> 00:08:35,571
-What'd you do?
-Just drive.

75
00:08:35,774 --> 00:08:37,002
What did you do?

76
00:09:05,054 --> 00:09:06,612
So, want the job?

77
00:09:07,254 --> 00:09:08,607
It depends.

78
00:09:09,094 --> 00:09:11,449
I don't wanna get mixed up in nothing.

79
00:09:12,854 --> 00:09:15,129
Walk out the door in the morning...

80
00:09:16,094 --> 00:09:17,812
...you're mixed up in something.

81
00:09:19,054 --> 00:09:21,693
Only thing is, if you're mixed up
to the top or not.

82
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:24,806
I'm just looking for somebody.
For a friend.

83
00:09:25,694 --> 00:09:27,093
Daphne Monet.

84
00:09:28,174 --> 00:09:31,803
Fiancée of Todd Carter.
She's been gone two weeks.

85
00:09:32,014 --> 00:09:34,972
It upset the man so much,
he stopped running for mayor.

86
00:09:36,374 --> 00:09:38,444
-I've never seen her.
-That's a shame.

87
00:09:40,614 --> 00:09:43,845
Daphne has a predilection
for the company of Negroes.

88
00:09:44,094 --> 00:09:47,006
She likes jazz, pig's feet
and dark meat.

89
00:09:49,414 --> 00:09:50,847
" Predilection."

90
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:57,003
I'd go looking for her myself...

91
00:09:57,294 --> 00:09:59,603
...but I'm not of the right persuasion.

92
00:10:00,494 --> 00:10:02,212
What do you want from me?

93
00:10:03,054 --> 00:10:04,407
What do you mean?

94
00:10:05,014 --> 00:10:07,084
-What do I do?
-Get her location.

95
00:10:09,294 --> 00:10:11,410
Mr. Carter wants to make up with her.

96
00:10:12,294 --> 00:10:13,568
$100.

97
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:15,893
I pay in advance.

98
00:10:21,814 --> 00:10:23,213
$100.

99
00:10:24,894 --> 00:10:26,566
To tell you where she's at?

100
00:10:26,774 --> 00:10:28,730
-That's right.
-And that's all?

101
00:10:29,134 --> 00:10:29,930
That's all.

102
00:10:30,894 --> 00:10:34,250
Joppy tells me you used to
frequent an illegal club.

103
00:10:34,494 --> 00:10:35,324
John's.

104
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:38,002
Somebody saw Daphne there
a few nights ago.

105
00:10:39,174 --> 00:10:40,243
Start tonight.

106
00:10:55,374 --> 00:10:57,604
Whoa, that's enough.
Thank you.

107
00:10:57,854 --> 00:11:00,414
-I'm gonna see you later.
-All right, yeah.

108
00:11:44,614 --> 00:11:46,605
I told you it's a grocery store.

109
00:11:47,214 --> 00:11:49,444
How you doing, baby?

110
00:11:50,854 --> 00:11:54,244
Mister, I told you, you can't
be in here harassing folks.

111
00:11:54,454 --> 00:11:55,523
What's going on?

112
00:11:55,774 --> 00:11:59,210
I paid these damn cops off,
and they're rousting my customers.

113
00:11:59,774 --> 00:12:02,766
That's what he get for messing
with that white woman.

114
00:12:03,414 --> 00:12:05,052
Don't pay him no attention.

115
00:12:05,254 --> 00:12:08,007
I done rung for Junior
to take care of that.

116
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:11,083
They got nobody but Deucy
and them tonight.

117
00:12:11,294 --> 00:12:14,604
I had Holiday on Thursday.
Yeah, you missed it.

118
00:12:16,414 --> 00:12:19,212
Wait for the cops to leave.
Take Easy upstairs.

119
00:12:19,414 --> 00:12:23,453
And if he's still down here,
come on back and throw his ass out.

120
00:12:23,694 --> 00:12:25,969
Get out of here.
You better be gone.

121
00:12:26,174 --> 00:12:27,607
I'll be here waiting.

122
00:12:27,814 --> 00:12:30,647
You just wait, mister.
Just keep waiting.

123
00:12:30,854 --> 00:12:33,493
Mr. McGee, there is no upstairs.

124
00:12:33,894 --> 00:12:35,646
-Got another cigarette?
-Sure.

125
00:12:35,894 --> 00:12:38,010
Zapattas. How you smoke
these damn things?

126
00:12:38,214 --> 00:12:40,569
You the only Negro
smoke Mexican cigarettes.

127
00:12:40,774 --> 00:12:43,607
Last time I heard these fellas
was back in Houston.

128
00:12:43,894 --> 00:12:46,010
The night Mouse pulled me off you.

129
00:12:46,214 --> 00:12:48,967
-That's how you remember it?
-That's the way it was.

130
00:12:49,174 --> 00:12:50,289
Look here...

131
00:12:50,494 --> 00:12:53,247
...admit that you helped
Mouse kill Navrochet.

132
00:12:53,454 --> 00:12:57,003
Get off that. You know I didn't
have nothing to do with that.

133
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:02,249
Where the white women?

134
00:13:02,494 --> 00:13:04,325
-I pay them no mind.
-I bet.

135
00:13:04,574 --> 00:13:07,247
Like you didn't help Mouse
kill his stepfather.

136
00:13:07,494 --> 00:13:10,247
Did you help him
kill his stepbrother too?

137
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:37,765
Give me a setup and a Coke back.

138
00:13:38,494 --> 00:13:42,612
Have you seen a girl named Dahlia,
Delila, something like that?

139
00:13:42,814 --> 00:13:45,203
White girl, supposed to
be something to see.

140
00:13:46,014 --> 00:13:48,653
If I do see her,
I'll keep her to myself.

141
00:14:09,454 --> 00:14:10,330
Keep the change.

142
00:14:12,774 --> 00:14:13,570
Deacon Odell.

143
00:14:16,174 --> 00:14:17,653
How you doing tonight?

144
00:14:17,854 --> 00:14:20,288
It's going all right.
It sure is going.

145
00:14:20,494 --> 00:14:22,450
Easy Rawlins, is that you?

146
00:14:23,574 --> 00:14:26,691
-Ain't jumped out of no windows yet?
-Not yet, Dupree.

147
00:14:26,894 --> 00:14:29,692
-You know Coretta, don't you?
-Sure, how you doing?

148
00:14:29,894 --> 00:14:30,849
I'm all right.

149
00:14:31,094 --> 00:14:32,652
This is Odell.

150
00:14:35,414 --> 00:14:37,086
Can we sit with y'all?

151
00:14:38,174 --> 00:14:39,368
Sure.

152
00:14:40,054 --> 00:14:42,488
We miss you down at the plant.

153
00:14:42,694 --> 00:14:45,447
Benny would've gave you
your job back, right?

154
00:14:45,694 --> 00:14:48,447
All you had to do was go
and say you was sorry.

155
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:50,804
I'm sorry, all right.
Give me that bourbon.

156
00:14:51,054 --> 00:14:54,046
Any man without his paycheck
is sure enough sorry.

157
00:14:56,454 --> 00:14:58,843
I got it.
Your money ain't no good.

158
00:14:59,374 --> 00:15:00,693
-This one's mine.
-You sure?

159
00:15:00,894 --> 00:15:04,409
-You the one ain't got no job.
-You the one ain't got no money.

160
00:15:06,254 --> 00:15:08,131
Y'all seen a white girl named Dahlia...

161
00:15:08,334 --> 00:15:11,212
...or Delila?
First name start with a " D."

162
00:15:15,894 --> 00:15:19,011
Coretta got herself a job
at the phone company.

163
00:15:20,454 --> 00:15:23,446
Congratulations. They ain't
hiring no mans down there?

164
00:15:51,494 --> 00:15:53,212
You all right, Odell?

165
00:16:03,574 --> 00:16:06,008
He used to play till the cock crowed.

166
00:16:07,694 --> 00:16:11,607
That old cock don't crow
nearly so much now.

167
00:16:20,054 --> 00:16:21,806
I better get on home.

168
00:16:24,614 --> 00:16:26,332
You'd be sorry if you go.

169
00:16:26,614 --> 00:16:28,127
I'd be sorry if I stay too.

170
00:16:29,294 --> 00:16:30,488
Good night.

171
00:16:33,614 --> 00:16:35,809
Daphne asleep by now...

172
00:16:38,814 --> 00:16:41,044
...so you can't get
none of that tonight.

173
00:16:42,694 --> 00:16:45,686
Go around here
telling everybody " Dahlia."

174
00:16:53,694 --> 00:16:55,810
Her name is Daphne.

175
00:16:59,254 --> 00:17:00,289
Do you know her?

176
00:17:16,294 --> 00:17:19,252
-Where you want me to put him?
-This ain't my house!

177
00:17:20,174 --> 00:17:21,527
This ain't my house.

178
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:23,571
Just throw him on the bed.

179
00:17:23,774 --> 00:17:25,287
Shut up.

180
00:17:28,494 --> 00:17:30,007
Be careful. The door.

181
00:17:30,494 --> 00:17:33,452
Threw him out of his place
because he couldn't pay rent.

182
00:17:33,894 --> 00:17:35,452
I shouldn't let him sleep here.

183
00:17:36,054 --> 00:17:38,966
-Damn, that Negro's heavy.
-I know, I know.

184
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:44,012
I need a cigarette.

185
00:17:44,894 --> 00:17:46,532
That all you need?

186
00:17:49,734 --> 00:17:53,363
Sun catch me tiptoeing outside
your door, what your neighbours say?

187
00:17:54,094 --> 00:17:55,812
All right, Easy.

188
00:17:57,694 --> 00:17:59,286
Dupree fell asleep on me...

189
00:17:59,494 --> 00:18:03,203
...and you just gonna walk out on me
like I was dog food, huh?

190
00:18:05,174 --> 00:18:07,210
Girl, what you talking about?

191
00:18:07,894 --> 00:18:09,407
Now, come on.

192
00:18:10,094 --> 00:18:12,369
Coretta, your man is in the next room.

193
00:18:16,694 --> 00:18:18,844
Tell me about your friend Daphne.

194
00:18:19,294 --> 00:18:21,603
Why you keep asking about her?

195
00:18:25,254 --> 00:18:27,768
Coloured women ain't good enough
for you no more?

196
00:18:28,094 --> 00:18:29,322
That ain't it.

197
00:18:34,054 --> 00:18:35,487
Shoot.

198
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:40,813
What if he heard something?

199
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:43,687
He asleep.

200
00:18:49,054 --> 00:18:50,612
Daddy, that's it!

201
00:18:55,094 --> 00:18:56,732
That's it.

202
00:18:58,254 --> 00:19:00,973
You're hitting my spot.
You're hitting my spot.

203
00:19:06,654 --> 00:19:08,212
Easy, Easy, Easy.

204
00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:10,882
I can't give up
that much loving, daddy.

205
00:19:11,094 --> 00:19:12,846
-Not the way things is.
-What things?

206
00:19:13,094 --> 00:19:14,846
He's right in the next room.

207
00:19:15,054 --> 00:19:17,409
Forget about Dupree.
You got me going.

208
00:19:17,654 --> 00:19:21,169
It ain't right, doing this
right in the next room.

209
00:19:21,414 --> 00:19:24,645
All you're doing is nosing
after my friend Daphne.

210
00:19:26,654 --> 00:19:27,848
No, baby.

211
00:19:28,054 --> 00:19:29,453
-That's just a job.
-What job?

212
00:19:29,654 --> 00:19:31,610
-Some man want me to find her.
-What man?

213
00:19:31,814 --> 00:19:33,213
I don't know what man.

214
00:19:33,414 --> 00:19:36,008
I don't want nobody but you.

215
00:19:45,774 --> 00:19:48,447
Daphne's my friend.
I can't do it.

216
00:20:01,014 --> 00:20:02,811
Just a little bit, okay?

217
00:20:03,014 --> 00:20:04,891
Just a little bit.

218
00:20:05,494 --> 00:20:07,246
Just a little bit, baby.

219
00:20:15,454 --> 00:20:17,763
Oh, you're hitting my spot.

220
00:20:18,854 --> 00:20:20,367
You're hitting my spot.

221
00:20:25,294 --> 00:20:28,445
And I went on hitting her spot
until just before sunup.

222
00:20:30,494 --> 00:20:34,043
I realized Coretta had found out
as much about what I was up to...

223
00:20:34,294 --> 00:20:36,603
...as I had found out
about Daphne Monet.

224
00:20:36,854 --> 00:20:40,893
As it turned out, Todd Carter
wasn't the only man in Daphne's life.

225
00:20:41,094 --> 00:20:45,326
She was shacking up with a smalltime
coloured gangster named Frank Green.

226
00:20:45,574 --> 00:20:48,486
Coretta had the nerve to charge me
$10 for that information.

227
00:20:48,694 --> 00:20:50,924
Everybody was in business in L.A.

228
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:55,489
That morning, I waited
for Albright to call.

229
00:20:55,694 --> 00:20:58,333
I tried to feel good
about paying a few bills...

230
00:20:58,614 --> 00:21:00,047
...and I mean just a few.

231
00:21:00,294 --> 00:21:03,570
Shoot, a loaf of bread
was damn near 15 cents.

232
00:21:03,894 --> 00:21:05,407
It was easy money.

233
00:21:05,894 --> 00:21:07,327
Too easy.

234
00:21:07,974 --> 00:21:09,407
Bye, Easy!

235
00:21:10,094 --> 00:21:12,562
-Where you going, Sophie?
-Back to Texas.

236
00:21:13,014 --> 00:21:14,766
Too fast for me out here.

237
00:21:20,694 --> 00:21:22,286
Get on away from the house!

238
00:21:22,494 --> 00:21:24,212
Get away from that tree!

239
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:29,166
Get on away from that tree!

240
00:21:30,494 --> 00:21:32,212
Get away from that tree!

241
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:35,566
Easy, how you doing?

242
00:22:36,574 --> 00:22:38,610
I hope you have good news for me.

243
00:22:38,894 --> 00:22:42,330
-Mr. Albright, is that you?
-Sure is. What's shaking?

244
00:22:42,574 --> 00:22:45,088
-I got what you want.
-Hold on to that.

245
00:22:45,294 --> 00:22:48,047
I only do business in person.
Tell you what.

246
00:22:48,294 --> 00:22:53,163
You come out here to Malibu.
Meet me at Fishermans Pier in an hour.

247
00:22:53,454 --> 00:22:55,763
Malibu? Mr. Albright, I don't--

248
00:23:59,054 --> 00:24:00,533
It's pretty out here.

249
00:24:01,894 --> 00:24:03,407
It's all right.

250
00:24:07,894 --> 00:24:10,488
I'm from Des Moines, lowa.

251
00:24:11,174 --> 00:24:12,607
Where are you from?

252
00:24:14,414 --> 00:24:15,688
Texas.

253
00:24:18,414 --> 00:24:20,723
Do they have an ocean in Texas?

254
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:25,327
-A gulf in Texas.
-Barbara! Where are you?

255
00:24:26,054 --> 00:24:27,806
Your friends are looking for you.

256
00:24:28,014 --> 00:24:29,606
Who cares?

257
00:24:29,894 --> 00:24:33,045
My sister brought me here
because my parents made her.

258
00:24:33,254 --> 00:24:37,725
All she wants to do is make out
with Herman and smoke cigarettes.

259
00:24:40,414 --> 00:24:41,529
What you doing here?

260
00:24:41,894 --> 00:24:44,089
-What's going on?
-Leave us alone.

261
00:24:44,294 --> 00:24:45,363
We're just talking.

262
00:24:45,574 --> 00:24:48,247
-We don't need you talking to her.
-Leave us alone.

263
00:24:48,454 --> 00:24:49,648
We're just talking.

264
00:24:49,894 --> 00:24:52,886
This nigger's trying
to pick up on Barbara.

265
00:24:53,094 --> 00:24:55,483
I don't need trouble.
Just being polite.

266
00:24:55,814 --> 00:24:58,203
No, you're not.
You're talking about the ocean.

267
00:25:00,334 --> 00:25:02,086
-What do you want?
-What's going on?

268
00:25:02,294 --> 00:25:03,647
What do you want?

269
00:25:04,094 --> 00:25:05,288
What do I want?

270
00:25:06,894 --> 00:25:08,725
I wanna see your brains.

271
00:25:08,934 --> 00:25:10,003
Run!

272
00:25:10,334 --> 00:25:11,130
Sorry.

273
00:25:11,334 --> 00:25:13,609
-I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.
-You're sorry?

274
00:25:13,814 --> 00:25:15,293
-Sorry enough?
-Yes, sir.

275
00:25:15,494 --> 00:25:16,324
Yeah?

276
00:25:16,574 --> 00:25:17,723
Then prove it.

277
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:20,647
Come on, prove it.
Show him.

278
00:25:20,854 --> 00:25:22,173
Get down on your knees.

279
00:25:22,374 --> 00:25:24,808
Suck his peter, you son of a bitch!

280
00:25:25,174 --> 00:25:26,926
I think he's got the point.

281
00:25:27,134 --> 00:25:28,806
-Go on.
-He's got the point!

282
00:25:29,174 --> 00:25:32,689
Do it! I'll kill you.
I'll blow your brains out.

283
00:25:33,734 --> 00:25:35,008
Don't shoot me, please.

284
00:25:35,214 --> 00:25:36,010
Go on.

285
00:25:36,934 --> 00:25:38,083
Go on.

286
00:25:43,774 --> 00:25:45,924
Son of a gun, you're gonna do it,
aren't you?

287
00:25:46,534 --> 00:25:48,013
Sick bastard.

288
00:25:49,134 --> 00:25:50,613
Oh, no, my eye!

289
00:25:53,294 --> 00:25:54,090
Get out!

290
00:25:55,494 --> 00:25:59,726
-You call the cops, I'll kill you!
-Hurry up, man. Come on!

291
00:26:01,974 --> 00:26:05,728
I don't think they'd call the cops,
but we better get out of here.

292
00:26:06,374 --> 00:26:07,363
What do you got?

293
00:26:07,574 --> 00:26:10,486
No harm will come
to that girl because of me?

294
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:13,686
Carter says he wants to live
happily ever after with her.

295
00:26:13,894 --> 00:26:15,247
What you got?

296
00:26:15,454 --> 00:26:19,288
-She was with a man named Frank Green.
-Hang on. Where?

297
00:26:20,454 --> 00:26:22,809
Skylar Apartments.
Skylar and 83rd.

298
00:26:23,094 --> 00:26:25,892
Frank Green.
What do you know about this guy?

299
00:26:26,254 --> 00:26:30,042
He's a gangster. Hijacks liquor
and cigarettes. Good with a knife.

300
00:26:30,254 --> 00:26:32,893
-Seen him in action?
-No, I just heard about him.

301
00:26:39,974 --> 00:26:41,248
Here's another 100.

302
00:26:41,454 --> 00:26:43,046
I'll be calling you again.

303
00:26:59,134 --> 00:27:01,045
Mr. Rawlins, I'm Detective Miller.

304
00:27:01,254 --> 00:27:02,687
Mason. Hands on the car.

305
00:27:02,894 --> 00:27:04,293
-Come with us.
-Where?

306
00:27:04,494 --> 00:27:06,086
-You'll see.
-Why am I arrested?

307
00:27:06,294 --> 00:27:08,683
-You'll see.
-I got a right to know why.

308
00:27:08,894 --> 00:27:12,603
You got a right to fall down,
break your face and come with me.

309
00:27:19,574 --> 00:27:21,883
-You got him?
-Got him coming home.

310
00:27:34,134 --> 00:27:37,843
Ezekiel Rawlins. You can take
those cuffs off if you cooperate.

311
00:27:38,534 --> 00:27:40,889
-Yes, sir, I'm cooperating.
-Turn around.

312
00:27:45,094 --> 00:27:47,005
Sit over there. Sit down.

313
00:27:51,774 --> 00:27:54,083
Where were you this morning
about 5 a.m.?

314
00:27:54,374 --> 00:27:55,443
What?

315
00:27:55,854 --> 00:27:57,367
He means this morning!

316
00:28:01,174 --> 00:28:04,086
I was out drinking.
I carried a friend into his house.

317
00:28:04,334 --> 00:28:06,564
I don't know.
I didn't look at a clock.

318
00:28:09,294 --> 00:28:13,082
You were drinking at 89th and Central,
illegal club called John's.

319
00:28:13,294 --> 00:28:16,331
Answer. You got a lot bigger
troubles than an illegal bar.

320
00:28:16,574 --> 00:28:19,042
-What you talking about?
-We're talking about...

321
00:28:19,254 --> 00:28:23,486
...taking your black ass out
and putting a bullet in your head.

322
00:28:23,694 --> 00:28:24,683
Sit down.

323
00:28:31,374 --> 00:28:33,444
When did you leave
Coretta James' house?

324
00:28:33,654 --> 00:28:35,246
Around 5:30, I guess.

325
00:28:35,494 --> 00:28:37,724
-Did you go back later?
-No, sir, I did not.

326
00:28:37,934 --> 00:28:40,448
Did you and Dupree have words
over Miss James?

327
00:28:40,654 --> 00:28:41,803
-Words?
-You heard him!

328
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:43,612
Did you two argue over Coretta?

329
00:28:43,814 --> 00:28:46,328
-Did you?
-No, we didn't argue about nothing!

330
00:28:46,534 --> 00:28:48,729
-He was asleep!
-She went to sleep too.

331
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:51,171
But she won't wake up.

332
00:28:52,694 --> 00:28:54,810
-Where did you go when you left?
-Wait.

333
00:28:55,054 --> 00:28:56,487
She won't wake up?

334
00:28:56,734 --> 00:28:59,407
-Where'd you go?
-I don't know! I had a hangover!

335
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:01,963
-You had a hangover.
-I went home!

336
00:29:02,174 --> 00:29:03,493
That explains everything.

337
00:29:03,734 --> 00:29:04,610
He had a hangover.

338
00:29:06,614 --> 00:29:07,729
Back off!

339
00:29:08,134 --> 00:29:10,284
Back off! Back off!

340
00:29:10,854 --> 00:29:11,684
Get out of here!

341
00:29:11,894 --> 00:29:14,328
Let's go! Get out of here!

342
00:29:14,854 --> 00:29:17,049
Come on, you son of a bitch!

343
00:29:17,654 --> 00:29:18,928
Calm down!

344
00:29:19,894 --> 00:29:21,373
You son of a bitch.

345
00:29:34,494 --> 00:29:37,133
They left me alone in
that musty room for 3 hours...

346
00:29:37,374 --> 00:29:41,447
... till some guy in a suit about
two sizes too big said I could go.

347
00:29:42,854 --> 00:29:46,893
The game of cops and niggers kept up
outside, but I hardly noticed.

348
00:29:48,294 --> 00:29:50,410
I had seen dead bodies before.

349
00:29:50,974 --> 00:29:52,327
Cold, hard...

350
00:29:53,054 --> 00:29:54,328
...still as concrete...

351
00:29:54,534 --> 00:29:56,889
... eyes wide open,
staring up at nothing.

352
00:29:58,054 --> 00:29:59,453
But not Coretta.

353
00:30:00,374 --> 00:30:02,251
I could still feel her heartbeat.

354
00:30:16,894 --> 00:30:18,805
Hey, Ezekiel Rawlins.

355
00:30:19,894 --> 00:30:22,852
Somebody in the back
would like to talk to you.

356
00:30:23,574 --> 00:30:25,007
I ain't got time.

357
00:30:25,534 --> 00:30:27,126
Get in. We'll take you.

358
00:30:34,614 --> 00:30:37,526
My boss wants to talk to you
about Coretta James.

359
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:45,246
If he wanted to hurt you,
it would've happened already.

360
00:30:45,494 --> 00:30:46,404
Come on.

361
00:30:48,774 --> 00:30:50,093
Get in.

362
00:31:16,094 --> 00:31:18,244
Go up front and sit with Norman.

363
00:31:18,454 --> 00:31:19,887
Give me a kiss.

364
00:31:27,094 --> 00:31:29,130
That's my adopted son, Jesus.

365
00:31:31,334 --> 00:31:33,404
I can see the police
roughed you up a bit.

366
00:31:35,254 --> 00:31:38,530
That's a practice of theirs
that has to change.

367
00:31:38,774 --> 00:31:40,492
That has to change.

368
00:31:41,574 --> 00:31:43,087
She was beaten...

369
00:31:43,894 --> 00:31:47,489
...and died of a heavy blow
to the back of the head.

370
00:31:50,134 --> 00:31:51,408
I suppose you know that.

371
00:31:52,054 --> 00:31:53,533
No, I didn't, Mr. Terell.

372
00:31:53,734 --> 00:31:56,692
-You know who I am?
-I read the newspapers.

373
00:31:56,894 --> 00:31:58,885
You're running for mayor
against Carter.

374
00:31:59,094 --> 00:32:01,483
I am the next mayor, Mr. Rawlins.

375
00:32:01,694 --> 00:32:04,492
And, luckily for you,
a friend of the Negro.

376
00:32:05,574 --> 00:32:07,292
Coretta worked a while for me.

377
00:32:08,174 --> 00:32:11,769
She answered phones at my campaign
office on 103rd and Western.

378
00:32:12,374 --> 00:32:15,605
So when I heard that
the police had a suspect...

379
00:32:15,974 --> 00:32:19,523
...l got out of bed immediately
because of my concern.

380
00:32:21,774 --> 00:32:23,969
Was there anyone with you,
Mr. Rawlins?

381
00:32:24,854 --> 00:32:27,493
Anyone besides Mr. Dupree Brouchard?

382
00:32:27,774 --> 00:32:28,729
No, sir.

383
00:32:29,574 --> 00:32:32,486
A young lady named
Daphne Monet, perhaps?

384
00:32:36,374 --> 00:32:37,568
Nobody.

385
00:32:38,454 --> 00:32:40,570
Of course not. Why would...

386
00:32:40,974 --> 00:32:45,252
Why would you tell someone
whom you've only just met?

387
00:32:48,054 --> 00:32:49,806
You can trust me.

388
00:32:50,774 --> 00:32:52,127
There was nobody else there.

389
00:32:55,934 --> 00:32:57,162
I believe you.

390
00:32:57,774 --> 00:32:59,765
-Can we drop you off?
-No.

391
00:33:01,494 --> 00:33:02,449
I'll get out here.

392
00:33:02,774 --> 00:33:06,528
-This must be quite out of your way.
-No, it's okay.

393
00:33:12,534 --> 00:33:14,570
May I offer you cab fare?

394
00:33:16,534 --> 00:33:18,445
-No, thank you.
-Are you sure?

395
00:33:18,654 --> 00:33:19,564
It's okay.

396
00:33:49,334 --> 00:33:51,450
You're hitting my spot, baby.

397
00:33:53,174 --> 00:33:55,893
Daphne asleep by now, so...

398
00:33:57,454 --> 00:34:00,127
Go around here
telling everybody "Dahlia. "

399
00:34:00,454 --> 00:34:03,491
Coloured women ain't
good enough for you no more?

400
00:34:05,374 --> 00:34:07,968
All you doing is
nosing after my friend.

401
00:34:08,174 --> 00:34:11,166
Coloured women ain't
good enough for you no more?

402
00:34:25,174 --> 00:34:26,732
Is this Mr. Rawlins?

403
00:34:26,974 --> 00:34:28,293
Who's this?

404
00:34:28,814 --> 00:34:30,532
This is Daphne Monet.

405
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:35,805
-You're looking for me.
-Who told you that?

406
00:34:36,294 --> 00:34:38,046
You know who told me.

407
00:34:38,774 --> 00:34:39,968
Coretta.

408
00:34:41,374 --> 00:34:43,524
She was found murdered this morning.

409
00:34:45,774 --> 00:34:47,810
I don't know what I should do.

410
00:34:48,334 --> 00:34:51,690
Do you care to talk to me alone,
or should I call the police?

411
00:34:51,934 --> 00:34:54,084
Ain't no reason to call the police.

412
00:34:54,334 --> 00:34:56,928
Then come over
and explain yourself to me.

413
00:34:57,894 --> 00:34:59,964
I'm at the Ambassador Hotel.

414
00:35:00,734 --> 00:35:02,884
This part of the hotel is white-only.

415
00:35:03,094 --> 00:35:07,087
So go to the side entrance,
and the bellboy will sneak you up.

416
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:38,406
Hello, Mr. Rawlins.

417
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:40,772
Hello, Miss Monet.

418
00:35:44,094 --> 00:35:48,053
Should I think of you as a friend
of Coretta's or a private dick?

419
00:35:50,094 --> 00:35:51,732
Well, I ain't no detective.

420
00:35:52,774 --> 00:35:56,130
I was just hired by a fella
that works for Todd Carter.

421
00:35:59,174 --> 00:36:01,688
I had to pay Coretta
not to tell you where I was.

422
00:36:01,974 --> 00:36:03,692
She got you too.

423
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:11,093
She definitely gave me
the wrong address.

424
00:36:11,774 --> 00:36:14,527
-Where'd she say I was?
-Said you was in Watts.

425
00:36:14,734 --> 00:36:17,806
At the Skylar Apartments
with a fella named Frank Green.

426
00:36:19,774 --> 00:36:21,571
What else did she tell you?

427
00:36:22,374 --> 00:36:24,205
I don't know.
What else is there?

428
00:36:24,534 --> 00:36:25,603
Nothing.

429
00:36:26,374 --> 00:36:30,367
I make no apology for my feelings
for Frank. He's very dear to me.

430
00:36:30,574 --> 00:36:31,484
Bourbon?

431
00:36:31,734 --> 00:36:33,167
Please, straight up.

432
00:36:35,254 --> 00:36:37,290
How well did you know Coretta?

433
00:36:38,094 --> 00:36:40,289
She was a very close friend.

434
00:36:40,534 --> 00:36:42,684
Maybe you know why she got killed?

435
00:36:46,054 --> 00:36:47,612
Why would I know that?

436
00:36:48,494 --> 00:36:51,133
She was your friend.
She knew about you and Frank.

437
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:53,689
Maybe somebody wanted
to keep that secret.

438
00:36:54,974 --> 00:36:58,284
-Mr. Rawlins, if you think--
-Easy. You can call me Easy.

439
00:36:58,694 --> 00:37:01,652
Easy, if you think
Frank killed Coretta...

440
00:37:01,854 --> 00:37:03,765
...you don't know
very much about him.

441
00:37:04,974 --> 00:37:08,853
Frank doesn't beat people up. He
prefers to use a knife as his weapon.

442
00:37:10,054 --> 00:37:12,284
What do you prefer as your weapon?

443
00:37:16,654 --> 00:37:18,929
Why not search me and find out?

444
00:37:42,454 --> 00:37:43,967
Mind if I have another drink?

445
00:37:45,454 --> 00:37:46,728
Help yourself.

446
00:37:51,854 --> 00:37:53,845
-Listen, Mr. Rawlins--
-Easy.

447
00:37:54,094 --> 00:37:55,163
Easy...

448
00:37:55,374 --> 00:37:58,366
...l called to ask you
to drive me to Todd's house.

449
00:38:00,574 --> 00:38:01,484
Pardon?

450
00:38:02,454 --> 00:38:05,924
You found me. Now I want you
to take me to Todd Carter's.

451
00:38:06,934 --> 00:38:08,890
Call Todd Carter.
Have him send for you.

452
00:38:10,134 --> 00:38:13,365
I have to go someplace
else on the way.

453
00:38:13,654 --> 00:38:16,566
Someplace I don't want
Todd to know about.

454
00:38:21,494 --> 00:38:23,564
There's a man named Richard McGee.

455
00:38:23,774 --> 00:38:25,651
He lives up in Laurel Canyon.

456
00:38:25,854 --> 00:38:28,573
He delivered a letter of mine
to the wrong place...

457
00:38:28,774 --> 00:38:30,093
...and I must get it back.

458
00:38:30,454 --> 00:38:32,206
At 4:00 in the morning?

459
00:38:33,254 --> 00:38:34,403
Important letter.

460
00:38:34,774 --> 00:38:36,412
Yes, it is.

461
00:38:37,094 --> 00:38:39,847
But I need to go there
before I go to Todd's.

462
00:38:40,894 --> 00:38:42,043
I'll pay you.

463
00:38:44,774 --> 00:38:46,207
When did you talk to Coretta?

464
00:38:49,054 --> 00:38:51,329
I don't know, 7:30, 8:00, I guess.

465
00:38:51,534 --> 00:38:53,252
Listen, Easy, I don't want...

466
00:38:55,254 --> 00:38:56,767
...to talk about Coretta now.

467
00:38:56,974 --> 00:38:58,373
Did you go to her house?

468
00:39:07,254 --> 00:39:08,289
No.

469
00:39:10,054 --> 00:39:11,533
She called me.

470
00:39:14,654 --> 00:39:15,973
She was in a good mood.

471
00:39:17,774 --> 00:39:19,332
She always...

472
00:39:20,134 --> 00:39:22,443
I didn't mean to upset you, Daphne.

473
00:39:23,254 --> 00:39:24,926
But you understand that...

474
00:39:25,214 --> 00:39:28,365
...you was the last one to talk
to her before she got killed.

475
00:39:29,134 --> 00:39:31,090
I don't mean to upset you...

476
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:34,247
...but as far as I know,
you were the last one to see her.

477
00:39:36,254 --> 00:39:38,085
Now, where does that leave us?

478
00:39:46,054 --> 00:39:49,171
All right, change out of
that housecoat. I'll carry you.

479
00:40:03,654 --> 00:40:04,723
Are you nervous?

480
00:40:04,974 --> 00:40:06,851
Nervous? Here I was...

481
00:40:07,054 --> 00:40:10,091
...at night, in a white neighbourhood
with a white woman.

482
00:40:10,374 --> 00:40:11,602
I wasn't nervous.

483
00:40:11,854 --> 00:40:13,253
I was stupid.

484
00:40:13,974 --> 00:40:15,646
Make a left up here.

485
00:40:15,854 --> 00:40:19,688
Getting Daphne back to Todd Carter
suddenly didn't seem so easy.

486
00:40:20,254 --> 00:40:22,245
Who was this guy Richard McGee?

487
00:40:22,454 --> 00:40:24,490
Just park behind that car.

488
00:41:46,694 --> 00:41:48,127
Oh, my God!

489
00:43:24,734 --> 00:43:27,373
-Who's that at the door?
-It's him.

490
00:43:28,294 --> 00:43:29,886
You fought in Europe?

491
00:43:32,374 --> 00:43:34,205
What you doing in my house?

492
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:37,167
What happened to your head?

493
00:43:38,134 --> 00:43:41,888
What you doing in my house? You got
no right to break into my house!

494
00:43:43,574 --> 00:43:45,132
Where have you been?

495
00:43:45,574 --> 00:43:48,486
I went to see a girl. Why?
You don't get none?

496
00:43:48,694 --> 00:43:50,685
I didn't come here to play, nigger.

497
00:43:54,494 --> 00:43:56,291
That's my money in your pocket.

498
00:43:56,894 --> 00:43:59,328
We've been by the address
you gave me on Frank.

499
00:43:59,534 --> 00:44:01,286
But he moved from there.

500
00:44:01,774 --> 00:44:02,570
A year ago.

501
00:44:03,174 --> 00:44:05,927
What do you want me to do?
I'll give you the money--

502
00:44:07,654 --> 00:44:09,292
Do you believe in God?

503
00:44:09,774 --> 00:44:13,084
I'm curious if pain's any different
for a religious man.

504
00:44:13,294 --> 00:44:15,967
-I'll show you what I do to liars.
-I seen her.

505
00:44:16,374 --> 00:44:17,363
Where?

506
00:44:19,774 --> 00:44:20,923
Come on.

507
00:44:22,134 --> 00:44:25,046
She called me. I carried her
up to the Hollywood Hills.

508
00:44:25,894 --> 00:44:27,691
-Where's she now?
-She took off.

509
00:44:27,894 --> 00:44:29,293
Bullshit. Where is she?

510
00:44:30,254 --> 00:44:31,767
She took off.

511
00:44:32,334 --> 00:44:35,053
While I was looking at the dead man,
she took off.

512
00:44:43,094 --> 00:44:44,129
Come on in.

513
00:44:50,134 --> 00:44:51,533
Sit down.

514
00:44:58,774 --> 00:45:00,571
What'd she do? Take his car?

515
00:45:02,294 --> 00:45:03,568
McGee.

516
00:45:03,774 --> 00:45:05,685
Write down where you picked her up.

517
00:45:08,854 --> 00:45:10,207
Write it down!

518
00:45:24,654 --> 00:45:27,293
This bologna is stuck in my molar.

519
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:30,686
I get that with popcorn.

520
00:45:33,774 --> 00:45:35,048
Get me some whiskey.

521
00:45:36,694 --> 00:45:39,492
It's in the cabinet.
You get it your damn self.

522
00:45:43,974 --> 00:45:46,852
He's got balls,
you gotta give him that.

523
00:45:47,334 --> 00:45:48,130
Shoot him.

524
00:45:48,694 --> 00:45:50,173
I'm just kidding.

525
00:45:59,974 --> 00:46:01,930
Easy, you're a brave man.

526
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:04,090
I need brave men working for me.

527
00:46:04,294 --> 00:46:06,046
You do a nice job too.

528
00:46:06,974 --> 00:46:07,884
Get me a whiskey.

529
00:46:09,334 --> 00:46:11,609
Find Frank Green.
He'll lead us to her.

530
00:46:11,974 --> 00:46:13,612
No, thank you.

531
00:46:14,774 --> 00:46:17,368
Too many people getting killed
around me already.

532
00:46:23,374 --> 00:46:25,569
You're connectible to two murders.

533
00:46:28,694 --> 00:46:31,083
You're gonna do whatever
I tell you to do.

534
00:46:33,094 --> 00:46:35,369
You find him.
I'll be checking in.

535
00:46:42,294 --> 00:46:44,489
That's some cheap shit.
Let's go.

536
00:47:01,494 --> 00:47:03,849
Since Albright liked
surprise parties...

537
00:47:04,294 --> 00:47:06,933
...l had a friend of my own
I wanted to invite.

538
00:47:07,174 --> 00:47:10,007
I placed a call to
Etta Mae Alexander in Houston.

539
00:47:10,254 --> 00:47:12,245
I gave her a message
for her husband...

540
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:13,250
...Mouse.

541
00:47:34,334 --> 00:47:39,249
Cast your vote on June 11
for Matthew Terell.

542
00:47:59,854 --> 00:48:01,890
That girl called me last night.

543
00:48:02,134 --> 00:48:03,123
What girl?

544
00:48:03,334 --> 00:48:05,848
The one your friend Albright
is looking for.

545
00:48:07,734 --> 00:48:10,407
-That's lucky.
-It wasn't no luck. It was you.

546
00:48:11,814 --> 00:48:16,251
Only you and Coretta had my number
and knew I was looking for the girl.

547
00:48:16,454 --> 00:48:18,649
Coretta was too busy scamming Daphne.

548
00:48:18,894 --> 00:48:21,567
-It was you.
-Maybe she looked in the phone book.

549
00:48:21,774 --> 00:48:24,288
I ain't in the book.
I thought you was my friend.

550
00:48:24,534 --> 00:48:26,570
Why didn't you tell him
where she was?

551
00:48:26,774 --> 00:48:30,289
What the hell you mean, looking
all ugly like you'll do something?

552
00:48:30,734 --> 00:48:32,690
I think I'll do something.

553
00:48:34,174 --> 00:48:35,368
Stop that shit!

554
00:48:36,334 --> 00:48:39,644
That's my marble! My uncle
left me that after he died!

555
00:48:39,894 --> 00:48:42,089
Goddamn it,
he's about to get it back.

556
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:44,091
-Let's talk.
-Talk!

557
00:48:44,334 --> 00:48:45,687
What you got me into?

558
00:48:45,934 --> 00:48:47,845
I told her Albright
was looking for her.

559
00:48:48,094 --> 00:48:51,291
I figured I'd help you make
a few dollars and throw Albright off!

560
00:48:51,534 --> 00:48:54,412
She wanted to know about you.
I gave her your number.

561
00:48:54,614 --> 00:48:56,013
-Where's she at?
-I don't know!

562
00:48:56,254 --> 00:48:57,607
Don't lie to me!

563
00:48:57,814 --> 00:48:59,008
I'm not lying to you!

564
00:48:59,214 --> 00:49:02,047
-What's she running from, then?
-She didn't tell me.

565
00:49:03,454 --> 00:49:07,049
Easy, look at me.
I am your friend!

566
00:49:08,534 --> 00:49:11,048
I didn't mean to get you
in no trouble.

567
00:49:12,254 --> 00:49:14,051
Look, you seen her.

568
00:49:14,294 --> 00:49:16,649
I mean, she is something else, man.

569
00:49:18,894 --> 00:49:20,646
You know what I'm saying?

570
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:25,250
Oh, Joppy...

571
00:49:30,414 --> 00:49:31,608
What?

572
00:49:38,094 --> 00:49:41,450
Like Albright said,
"When you're mixed up in something...

573
00:49:41,814 --> 00:49:44,044
...you better be mixed up
to the top. "

574
00:49:44,294 --> 00:49:46,125
So that's where I was going.

575
00:49:46,334 --> 00:49:48,245
All the way to the top.

576
00:49:49,334 --> 00:49:53,043
Everybody was peeing on my head
and telling me it was rain.

577
00:49:53,254 --> 00:49:56,803
Guess they figured I was some new
kind of fool, and maybe I was.

578
00:49:57,014 --> 00:49:59,323
I was ready to start fighting back.

579
00:49:59,534 --> 00:50:02,970
I believed somehow that I could
live through this bad dream...

580
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:05,564
...about pretty girls and gangsters...

581
00:50:06,094 --> 00:50:09,450
...and standing face-to-face
with the richest man in town.

582
00:50:24,534 --> 00:50:25,933
May I help you?

583
00:50:26,134 --> 00:50:29,729
-I'm looking for Mr. Carter.
-I'm sorry, he's a very busy man.

584
00:50:29,934 --> 00:50:33,449
Too busy to hear about that
chippy of his that dumped him?

585
00:50:33,934 --> 00:50:35,049
Excuse me.

586
00:50:35,654 --> 00:50:38,043
-Mr.--?
-Rawlins.

587
00:50:39,214 --> 00:50:41,250
Why don't you come with me, sir?

588
00:50:45,254 --> 00:50:48,132
It's not smart talking about
Carter's business to a secretary.

589
00:50:48,334 --> 00:50:49,926
There's too much going on...

590
00:50:50,134 --> 00:50:53,251
...for me to give a damn about
what you think is smart.

591
00:51:06,294 --> 00:51:08,444
Wait here, Mr. Rawlins.

592
00:51:20,094 --> 00:51:21,846
Mr. Carter will see you.

593
00:51:23,894 --> 00:51:25,646
Mr. Rawlins.

594
00:51:25,854 --> 00:51:27,253
Mr. Carter.

595
00:51:28,134 --> 00:51:29,852
You've heard from Daphne?

596
00:51:30,094 --> 00:51:31,652
Yeah, last night.

597
00:51:32,014 --> 00:51:33,527
She's still in town?

598
00:51:34,014 --> 00:51:35,242
She was last night.

599
00:51:36,414 --> 00:51:38,803
And what did she say?

600
00:51:39,014 --> 00:51:40,652
What was she wearing?

601
00:51:42,334 --> 00:51:44,325
Blue dress, high heels.

602
00:51:44,614 --> 00:51:45,410
That's her.

603
00:51:45,934 --> 00:51:47,367
Would you like to come in?

604
00:51:47,894 --> 00:51:48,849
Please.

605
00:51:51,734 --> 00:51:54,089
-Have a seat.
-Thank you.

606
00:51:54,294 --> 00:51:56,649
-I want some answers.
-Would you like a brandy?

607
00:51:57,734 --> 00:52:00,248
I wanna know what I got myself into.

608
00:52:00,694 --> 00:52:01,649
Pardon?

609
00:52:02,734 --> 00:52:05,851
I wanna know the real reason
Mr. Albright hired me.

610
00:52:07,334 --> 00:52:08,767
Mr. Albright?

611
00:52:09,494 --> 00:52:12,247
Yeah, the man you hired
to find Daphne.

612
00:52:13,254 --> 00:52:15,449
I think there's been a mistake here.

613
00:52:18,134 --> 00:52:19,852
Who are you talking about?

614
00:52:20,214 --> 00:52:21,442
Wait a minute.

615
00:52:22,054 --> 00:52:24,409
You didn't hire somebody
to find your girl?

616
00:52:24,614 --> 00:52:25,842
Of course not.

617
00:52:26,494 --> 00:52:30,453
Until just now, I thought she was
hundreds of miles away from here.

618
00:52:32,094 --> 00:52:34,050
You say someone's looking for her?

619
00:52:36,254 --> 00:52:37,733
Someone's looking for her.

620
00:52:39,134 --> 00:52:42,524
Nothing personal,
but what's going on between y'all?

621
00:52:43,094 --> 00:52:44,288
Nothing.

622
00:52:45,534 --> 00:52:47,525
We were going to get married.

623
00:52:47,734 --> 00:52:52,091
We had a fight, and it is
really none of your concern.

624
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:54,091
So someone's after her.

625
00:52:54,334 --> 00:52:56,245
Mr. Albright.

626
00:52:56,894 --> 00:53:00,682
-And he says I'm his employer.
-Ever heard of Richard McGee?

627
00:53:01,814 --> 00:53:02,610
Who?

628
00:53:05,214 --> 00:53:06,647
Look, l...

629
00:53:07,694 --> 00:53:10,970
-Why would somebody be after her?
-Can you find her again?

630
00:53:11,614 --> 00:53:13,093
It's important...

631
00:53:13,294 --> 00:53:14,647
...for her sake.

632
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:17,452
I'm willing to pay you.

633
00:53:17,734 --> 00:53:19,292
Why did she leave?

634
00:53:20,414 --> 00:53:24,646
It's really none of your concern,
but I'll pay you to find her.

635
00:53:31,214 --> 00:53:32,249
$1000.

636
00:53:33,734 --> 00:53:34,610
$1000?

637
00:53:36,134 --> 00:53:37,487
I'll take $200 right now.

638
00:53:37,694 --> 00:53:39,571
You're trying to
take advantage of me.

639
00:53:39,774 --> 00:53:41,651
Let me inform you of something.

640
00:53:41,854 --> 00:53:45,324
The incumbent mayor, the chief
of police, close friends of mine.

641
00:53:45,734 --> 00:53:47,850
They eat at my house regularly.

642
00:53:48,054 --> 00:53:50,409
That's good. Then they
can help us find her.

643
00:53:53,974 --> 00:53:55,453
No, they can't.

644
00:53:57,534 --> 00:53:59,889
I'll have Baxter
write you out a check.

645
00:54:00,094 --> 00:54:01,607
Why you stop running for mayor?

646
00:54:01,814 --> 00:54:05,284
-Baxter will write you a check.
-Why's Terell looking for Daphne?

647
00:54:05,694 --> 00:54:07,207
Baxter will write you a check.

648
00:54:07,854 --> 00:54:09,651
I'll take cash.

649
00:54:15,934 --> 00:54:18,653
Here, take it all.
Just take it all.

650
00:54:23,054 --> 00:54:24,851
I'll be in touch, Mr. Carter.

651
00:54:40,534 --> 00:54:42,331
So Albright had lied to me.

652
00:54:42,534 --> 00:54:45,253
Instead of working for Carter,
he worked for Terell...

653
00:54:45,454 --> 00:54:47,684
... the man running for mayor
against Carter.

654
00:54:47,894 --> 00:54:50,408
And they was all
throwing money my way...

655
00:54:50,614 --> 00:54:52,730
... to find the girl
in the blue dress.

656
00:54:52,934 --> 00:54:56,813
I knew her boyfriend Frank Green
hijacked trucks hauling liquor...

657
00:54:57,014 --> 00:55:00,404
...and sold it at half-price
to places down on Central Avenue.

658
00:55:00,734 --> 00:55:04,249
So I decided to kick up some dust
right in Frank's back yard.

659
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:17,765
Mr. Rawlins, what were you saying?

660
00:55:18,014 --> 00:55:19,049
Frank Green.

661
00:55:19,294 --> 00:55:20,522
-Who?
-I'm looking for him.

662
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:23,043
-I don't know.
-Why you treat me like this?

663
00:55:23,254 --> 00:55:26,007
-I don't know any Frank Green.
-You don't know Frank?

664
00:55:26,214 --> 00:55:28,045
You know me though, don't you?

665
00:55:35,934 --> 00:55:38,494
My man Frank Green
told me to talk to you.

666
00:55:38,734 --> 00:55:40,850
-He said to talk to you.
-Who is that?

667
00:55:41,054 --> 00:55:44,683
What do you mean, "Who is that?"
He told me to talk to you.

668
00:55:44,934 --> 00:55:47,368
Come on. Give me something.

669
00:55:48,054 --> 00:55:50,010
All right, give me a beer.

670
00:55:50,214 --> 00:55:52,682
Can I get a beer?
Can I get a beer?

671
00:55:52,934 --> 00:55:54,003
Thank you.

672
00:55:54,814 --> 00:55:57,612
Wait. Frank Green told me
you'd have pints for me.

673
00:55:57,814 --> 00:55:58,883
Who's Frank Green?

674
00:55:59,094 --> 00:56:03,087
-You know who Frank Green is.
-Al, talk to this man.

675
00:56:03,294 --> 00:56:06,206
-You know Frank.
-What are you talking about?

676
00:56:06,414 --> 00:56:07,642
You don't know Frank?

677
00:56:07,854 --> 00:56:10,049
-I don't.
-Let's get him on the phone.

678
00:56:21,254 --> 00:56:23,643
Don't need my trees trimmed.

679
00:56:32,134 --> 00:56:33,123
There's a man!

680
00:56:45,534 --> 00:56:47,013
Damn! Frank, wait a minute!

681
00:56:47,214 --> 00:56:49,125
Hold it! Let's talk!

682
00:56:51,734 --> 00:56:52,803
Let's talk.

683
00:56:56,734 --> 00:56:59,612
Wait a minute!
I got $500 for you, Frank.

684
00:56:59,814 --> 00:57:01,247
Rich white man wants--

685
00:57:14,934 --> 00:57:16,253
Goddamn it!

686
00:57:26,734 --> 00:57:28,213
Want me to shoot him?

687
00:57:28,414 --> 00:57:30,689
-Mouse!
-Want me to shoot him?

688
00:57:35,734 --> 00:57:37,247
It's all right.

689
00:57:37,694 --> 00:57:39,650
What the hell is happening, man?

690
00:57:40,614 --> 00:57:41,933
I'll blow your nose off.

691
00:57:42,134 --> 00:57:43,249
Don't shoot him!

692
00:57:45,734 --> 00:57:47,850
Where's Daphne Monet, Frank?

693
00:57:48,534 --> 00:57:50,889
Maybe you don't know where she is...

694
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:53,602
...but we can help
each other find her.

695
00:57:53,934 --> 00:57:56,243
-You heard him.
-Mouse, no!

696
00:58:02,334 --> 00:58:03,972
-Rawlins residence.
-Sit down.

697
00:58:04,454 --> 00:58:07,446
He busy right now.
You gonna have to call back.

698
00:58:12,534 --> 00:58:16,163
A rich man is willing to pay $1000
just to talk to this girl.

699
00:58:18,094 --> 00:58:21,052
$1000! That's a hell
of a lot of money, man!

700
00:58:23,734 --> 00:58:25,645
Wait, wait. Wait a minute.

701
00:58:25,854 --> 00:58:27,446
Let me try.

702
00:58:30,814 --> 00:58:32,486
Look here--
It's Frank, right?

703
00:58:40,334 --> 00:58:42,643
Let go of me, man!
Let go of me!

704
00:58:43,054 --> 00:58:44,123
Damn it!

705
00:58:45,614 --> 00:58:48,492
Don't you ever grab me
when I got a gun in my hand!

706
00:58:50,134 --> 00:58:51,647
Shit!

707
00:58:53,734 --> 00:58:55,292
You got blood on my coat.

708
00:58:55,494 --> 00:58:57,644
It's a damn expensive coat.

709
00:59:00,614 --> 00:59:02,491
Where's your bathroom at, man?

710
00:59:11,334 --> 00:59:13,290
We gotta find that girl
and get that money.

711
00:59:13,494 --> 00:59:15,530
No, we don't have to go find nobody!

712
00:59:15,734 --> 00:59:19,249
I done changed my mind.
I don't need your kind of help.

713
00:59:19,734 --> 00:59:24,012
Man cut a damn smile in your neck,
you tell me you don't need my help.

714
00:59:24,214 --> 00:59:27,206
You pulled this shit 5 years ago
when you killed Navrochet.

715
00:59:27,414 --> 00:59:30,326
You ain't been here 5 minutes,
you shot somebody already.

716
00:59:30,694 --> 00:59:31,729
Come on, Easy.

717
00:59:31,934 --> 00:59:34,243
-Cut me in on this thing, man.
-No.

718
00:59:35,014 --> 00:59:36,686
Easy, I'm trying to do right.

719
00:59:36,894 --> 00:59:39,089
I mean, you know, now.

720
00:59:41,334 --> 00:59:45,043
I could help you.
You'll need somebody at your back.

721
00:59:46,454 --> 00:59:49,287
-I'll let you run the show.
-You'll let me run the show?

722
00:59:49,534 --> 00:59:51,889
I won't do nothing
you don't tell me to do.

723
00:59:52,094 --> 00:59:54,449
You're gonna let me run the show?

724
00:59:57,094 --> 00:59:58,322
You'll do what I say?

725
00:59:58,814 --> 01:00:00,850
I'm gonna do everything you say.

726
01:00:01,414 --> 01:00:03,211
That's the wrong hand, Mouse.

727
01:00:06,814 --> 01:00:08,645
Boy, how you been?

728
01:00:09,894 --> 01:00:12,647
-Who was that on the phone?
-I don't know, man.

729
01:00:12,854 --> 01:00:14,651
Sounded like some white girl.

730
01:00:36,094 --> 01:00:38,608
Ezekiel. Came to ask you
a few more questions.

731
01:00:39,654 --> 01:00:42,646
-Why don't you invite us in?
-I'll come out.

732
01:00:44,734 --> 01:00:45,689
What happened?

733
01:00:46,134 --> 01:00:48,329
I don't remember
doing that to your neck.

734
01:00:49,214 --> 01:00:51,489
What do you know about Richard McGee?

735
01:00:51,734 --> 01:00:53,964
A dead white man in Laurel Canyon.

736
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:58,409
He has a note in his pocket
with " Coretta James" written on it.

737
01:00:58,614 --> 01:00:59,933
You feel more talkative?

738
01:01:00,254 --> 01:01:03,485
I'll bet six bits to a bottle of piss
we're looking at a double.

739
01:01:04,134 --> 01:01:06,204
If we place you
in the dead man's house.

740
01:01:06,414 --> 01:01:08,086
I wasn't in no dead man's house.

741
01:01:08,334 --> 01:01:10,973
We could go to the station,
send a team over here.

742
01:01:11,534 --> 01:01:14,492
They'll find something that
will place you at that house.

743
01:01:14,734 --> 01:01:17,009
Evidence has a funny way
of showing up.

744
01:01:17,214 --> 01:01:20,365
You ain't got nothing on me,
because I ain't done nothing.

745
01:01:20,574 --> 01:01:22,007
We know you know a lot more.

746
01:01:22,254 --> 01:01:23,767
Tell us everything you know...

747
01:01:24,014 --> 01:01:26,244
...or you're going down
for both murders.

748
01:01:26,494 --> 01:01:28,246
-I don't know nothing.
-Sure you do.

749
01:01:28,454 --> 01:01:30,410
-Let's go.
-All right, look.

750
01:01:30,614 --> 01:01:32,445
-Give me more time.
-Forget it.

751
01:01:32,694 --> 01:01:36,243
Give me till tomorrow morning.
Maybe I can dig something up.

752
01:01:38,454 --> 01:01:40,649
What do you think?
We could do that.

753
01:01:41,014 --> 01:01:42,652
Take the cuffs off.

754
01:01:43,414 --> 01:01:45,245
You got till tomorrow morning.

755
01:01:48,854 --> 01:01:51,129
Have a nice evening, Ezekiel.

756
01:01:51,454 --> 01:01:54,252
I played along, just like
the cops wanted me to.

757
01:01:54,814 --> 01:01:56,645
It was a game to them.

758
01:01:56,894 --> 01:02:00,409
But they'd play for keeps tomorrow
because a white man was dead now.

759
01:02:00,614 --> 01:02:03,845
Guilty or not, somebody was
gonna have to pay for this one.

760
01:02:08,334 --> 01:02:12,088
Is Dupree's sister's house
off Compton Boulevard or Avenue?

761
01:02:12,734 --> 01:02:16,329
-We're going somewhere else first.
-Did that girl call?

762
01:02:17,214 --> 01:02:18,567
We going to see her?

763
01:02:19,934 --> 01:02:20,923
No.

764
01:02:22,254 --> 01:02:25,883
-I see them people giving you trouble.
-I ain't got time.

765
01:02:26,094 --> 01:02:28,130
-Leave my trees alone!
-You got too many.

766
01:02:28,334 --> 01:02:32,293
-I'll knock down a couple for you.
-Leave my trees alone!

767
01:02:32,494 --> 01:02:35,247
Tell me what you think
when you get back, all right?

768
01:03:07,614 --> 01:03:09,844
-Who's there?
-Easy.

769
01:03:14,014 --> 01:03:15,891
-What you want?
-Let me in.

770
01:03:16,134 --> 01:03:19,012
I got no time to be fooling
with you. I'm sleeping.

771
01:03:19,214 --> 01:03:22,126
Open this door.
Act like you got some sense.

772
01:03:22,334 --> 01:03:23,483
Mouse.

773
01:03:23,694 --> 01:03:26,254
Get out the way, fool.
We ain't got all day.

774
01:03:27,374 --> 01:03:28,602
Have a seat.

775
01:03:28,934 --> 01:03:31,448
-Y'all want a beer?
-Sure. Thank you.

776
01:03:31,894 --> 01:03:34,203
What you smoking, Junior?
Zapattas?

777
01:03:40,694 --> 01:03:42,969
-This one's yours too.
-I don't know.

778
01:03:43,214 --> 01:03:44,124
You killed McGee.

779
01:03:44,934 --> 01:03:46,333
What you talking about?

780
01:03:46,534 --> 01:03:48,445
No time to play.
I know you killed him.

781
01:03:48,774 --> 01:03:50,890
-You crazy, man!
-Sit down.

782
01:03:57,294 --> 01:03:59,091
-Tell me.
-What you talking about?

783
01:03:59,294 --> 01:04:02,969
The police will, when they find your
prints in his house.

784
01:04:03,174 --> 01:04:03,970
Fingerprints?

785
01:04:04,414 --> 01:04:07,292
Hattie had you pull that man
out of John's that night.

786
01:04:07,534 --> 01:04:10,685
He was laying dead in the same suit
and a bullet in his head.

787
01:04:10,934 --> 01:04:12,208
I ain't killed nobody!

788
01:04:12,414 --> 01:04:15,451
Quit lying, you thick-headed,
cornbread-eating--

789
01:04:16,214 --> 01:04:17,852
Sit down, Junior.

790
01:04:19,934 --> 01:04:21,447
Sit down, now.

791
01:04:30,374 --> 01:04:32,604
Tell me, and maybe
I'll forget what I know.

792
01:04:32,814 --> 01:04:34,964
Or I'll tell Mouse to shoot you.

793
01:04:35,174 --> 01:04:37,369
You killed that man
and took his money.

794
01:04:37,574 --> 01:04:40,532
-I don't know who you talking about!
-You had to rob him!

795
01:04:40,734 --> 01:04:43,009
I didn't touch nothing
in that man's house!

796
01:04:43,454 --> 01:04:44,773
Goddamn.

797
01:04:48,294 --> 01:04:49,124
Sit down.

798
01:04:53,094 --> 01:04:55,210
Hattie had me take him
out to his car.

799
01:04:55,454 --> 01:04:58,571
He was so drunk he gave me $10
just to drive him home.

800
01:04:58,774 --> 01:05:01,004
-I know you took that.
-Hell, yeah.

801
01:05:01,294 --> 01:05:04,445
Then he asked about that
white girl you asked about.

802
01:05:04,654 --> 01:05:07,691
I told him I seen her with Coretta.
What the hell I care?

803
01:05:07,934 --> 01:05:09,492
You tell him, but not me?

804
01:05:09,694 --> 01:05:12,492
I don't like your ass.
And he give me $50.

805
01:05:12,694 --> 01:05:14,810
Just to tell him
you saw her with Coretta?

806
01:05:15,014 --> 01:05:16,367
To deliver a letter.

807
01:05:17,374 --> 01:05:20,047
I give it to Coretta to give
to her the next morning.

808
01:05:22,574 --> 01:05:24,485
You better be telling the truth.

809
01:05:24,694 --> 01:05:26,207
Come on, let's go.

810
01:05:26,574 --> 01:05:28,724
I'm telling the truth.
I ain't killed nobody.

811
01:05:28,974 --> 01:05:32,171
That man was alive when I left.
I ain't killed nobody!

812
01:05:33,854 --> 01:05:37,927
Daphne's letter had worked its way
over to the other side of town...

813
01:05:38,174 --> 01:05:40,085
... to Dupree's sister's house.

814
01:05:40,334 --> 01:05:41,483
I hoped.

815
01:05:41,734 --> 01:05:44,453
And Junior was innocent,
like I knew all along.

816
01:05:44,854 --> 01:05:48,847
But I couldn't see no harm in
letting the sucker sweat a little bit.

817
01:06:01,334 --> 01:06:04,246
-Tried to call you.
-Cops just let me out today.

818
01:06:04,494 --> 01:06:07,406
My sister's at work.
I ain't feel much like talking.

819
01:06:07,614 --> 01:06:09,684
-Raymond!
-Yeah, big man.

820
01:06:09,894 --> 01:06:12,613
Is them pig tails I smell up in there?

821
01:06:12,814 --> 01:06:15,123
Lula Mae made some before work.

822
01:06:15,334 --> 01:06:17,165
You'll have to excuse me.

823
01:06:19,654 --> 01:06:20,848
Dupree.

824
01:06:26,934 --> 01:06:28,253
I'm sorry.

825
01:06:30,254 --> 01:06:31,653
Thank you, Easy.

826
01:06:32,494 --> 01:06:36,248
Why somebody wanna kill her like that?
It don't make sense to me.

827
01:06:43,294 --> 01:06:47,651
Did Coretta say anything to you
about a letter she was keeping?

828
01:06:48,694 --> 01:06:49,843
A letter?

829
01:06:50,534 --> 01:06:51,967
What kind of letter?

830
01:06:52,414 --> 01:06:53,813
From that white girl.

831
01:06:54,374 --> 01:06:55,443
No.

832
01:06:56,094 --> 01:06:58,608
It's because of her
that Coretta got killed.

833
01:07:00,014 --> 01:07:01,003
Yeah.

834
01:07:01,734 --> 01:07:05,613
Everything between Daphne and Coretta
was always such a damn secret.

835
01:07:06,334 --> 01:07:07,687
That old girl...

836
01:07:08,134 --> 01:07:10,853
...didn't think nothing
about two-timing old Frank.

837
01:07:11,534 --> 01:07:14,606
-You want more tails?
-Thanks, Dupree.

838
01:07:15,494 --> 01:07:18,054
She messing around with
that guy running for mayor.

839
01:07:18,294 --> 01:07:21,047
-Todd Carter?
-Yeah, that's his name.

840
01:07:21,894 --> 01:07:24,931
She probably introduced Coretta
to one of them guys.

841
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:27,205
He probably came to the house...

842
01:07:27,414 --> 01:07:29,848
...saw that Coretta wasn't
that type of woman.

843
01:07:31,254 --> 01:07:33,245
Cop says she fought him.

844
01:07:34,814 --> 01:07:35,769
Imagine that.

845
01:07:37,094 --> 01:07:38,652
My baby fought them.

846
01:07:41,094 --> 01:07:43,164
Because she wouldn't
have nobody but me.

847
01:07:48,054 --> 01:07:49,487
I can't sleep.

848
01:07:52,134 --> 01:07:55,365
I keep seeing her face that morning
before I went to work.

849
01:07:57,854 --> 01:07:59,845
Junior had just came by the house...

850
01:08:00,054 --> 01:08:03,046
...and she come running out
carrying her Bible.

851
01:08:04,334 --> 01:08:05,733
She say...

852
01:08:06,694 --> 01:08:08,013
..." Keep this for me, baby."

853
01:08:10,774 --> 01:08:11,968
The Bible?

854
01:08:15,134 --> 01:08:17,853
The police won't even let me
go near the house.

855
01:08:19,494 --> 01:08:22,133
That's the only thing I got left
that belonged to her.

856
01:08:22,334 --> 01:08:23,289
The Bible.

857
01:08:25,734 --> 01:08:29,249
I knew it was a sign
because she's so religious.

858
01:08:30,134 --> 01:08:31,852
Oh, God!

859
01:08:33,534 --> 01:08:35,172
It's all right, big man.

860
01:08:35,654 --> 01:08:38,009
-I'm sorry.
-That's all right.

861
01:08:38,254 --> 01:08:40,484
Get you a drink. Drink this.

862
01:08:40,934 --> 01:08:43,732
-All right. Go on now.
-That's enough.

863
01:08:43,934 --> 01:08:45,287
Drink that.

864
01:09:37,494 --> 01:09:39,166
I was scared now...

865
01:09:39,414 --> 01:09:41,370
...and sick from what I saw.

866
01:09:41,814 --> 01:09:45,170
Pictures of a much younger
Matthew Terell and children.

867
01:09:45,654 --> 01:09:46,689
Innocent...

868
01:09:46,894 --> 01:09:48,122
...helpless...

869
01:09:48,414 --> 01:09:49,483
...naked children.

870
01:09:52,734 --> 01:09:54,645
I got it. Let's go.

871
01:09:55,494 --> 01:09:57,644
Is you crazy or is you drunk?

872
01:09:58,934 --> 01:10:00,003
Come on.

873
01:10:00,214 --> 01:10:01,249
Am I drunk?

874
01:10:01,494 --> 01:10:04,452
You saw me draw that gun.
No man can out-draw me.

875
01:10:04,694 --> 01:10:07,162
-Put the gun down.
-No, I'm drunk.

876
01:10:07,374 --> 01:10:09,365
I'm drunk. You right.

877
01:10:10,934 --> 01:10:13,050
I'm gonna put that gun right there.

878
01:10:13,254 --> 01:10:15,643
I'm gonna see who's drunk.

879
01:10:17,414 --> 01:10:20,053
Now, watch it now.
Watch it, goddamn it.

880
01:10:20,894 --> 01:10:22,691
Right there, now.

881
01:10:23,934 --> 01:10:26,687
This fool calling me out,
he ain't even got no gun.

882
01:10:26,934 --> 01:10:28,765
I'll kill that motherfucker.

883
01:10:30,454 --> 01:10:31,250
Let him go.

884
01:10:32,934 --> 01:10:34,333
Let him live.

885
01:10:34,534 --> 01:10:36,684
And he'll be scared of you
from now on.

886
01:10:36,934 --> 01:10:38,765
He better be scared
or I'll kill him.

887
01:10:38,974 --> 01:10:40,202
He will.

888
01:10:40,654 --> 01:10:41,609
You better tell him.

889
01:10:41,894 --> 01:10:43,168
I will.

890
01:10:43,454 --> 01:10:44,364
Trust me.

891
01:10:44,734 --> 01:10:46,053
I'll tell him.

892
01:10:47,214 --> 01:10:48,772
Shit.

893
01:10:51,454 --> 01:10:53,331
Keep an eye on him.

894
01:10:53,534 --> 01:10:55,047
Where you going?

895
01:11:14,694 --> 01:11:17,891
The pictures was eating at my pocket
like a cigarette burn.

896
01:11:18,094 --> 01:11:21,723
Albright killed for those pictures
to get them back for Terell.

897
01:11:21,934 --> 01:11:25,449
He killed Richard McGee,
who had sold the pictures to Daphne.

898
01:11:25,654 --> 01:11:27,292
Time was running out.

899
01:11:27,734 --> 01:11:30,487
But I had some unfinished
business with the girl.

900
01:11:30,814 --> 01:11:34,853
She had called earlier, and all
I needed was for her to call again.

901
01:12:10,614 --> 01:12:13,048
I'm sorry.
I broke into your house.

902
01:12:14,894 --> 01:12:16,725
Please don't be angry with me.

903
01:12:17,334 --> 01:12:19,643
Now, why should I be angry at you?

904
01:12:25,134 --> 01:12:27,170
May I have a cigarette?

905
01:12:32,134 --> 01:12:35,251
Coretta's boyfriend, Dupree,
got out of jail today.

906
01:12:35,934 --> 01:12:38,243
And you need me
to help you find him.

907
01:12:40,014 --> 01:12:42,244
I already got the pictures.

908
01:13:15,454 --> 01:13:18,412
I paid $7000 for those pictures.
They belong to me.

909
01:13:18,854 --> 01:13:21,084
Terell might have
something to say about that.

910
01:13:22,654 --> 01:13:24,884
I'll pay you $1000 for them.

911
01:13:25,094 --> 01:13:27,688
-You gave McGee seven.
-Then I'll give you seven.

912
01:13:28,214 --> 01:13:29,932
What does Terell have on you?

913
01:13:30,414 --> 01:13:31,608
Nothing.

914
01:13:32,054 --> 01:13:33,885
-You want the money or not?
-No.

915
01:13:34,614 --> 01:13:36,252
I got two murders hanging over me.

916
01:13:36,494 --> 01:13:39,372
Unless I find a killer by morning,
I'll go to jail.

917
01:13:39,974 --> 01:13:41,646
-Who killed Coretta?
-I don't know.

918
01:13:41,854 --> 01:13:44,209
-She was killed for the pictures?
-I don't know.

919
01:13:44,414 --> 01:13:47,053
Frank Green killed her
to bring you them pictures.

920
01:13:47,254 --> 01:13:49,131
-No.
-Tell it to the police...

921
01:13:49,334 --> 01:13:51,211
...because I ain't taking the rap.

922
01:13:53,174 --> 01:13:55,563
Put the phone down!
Put it down!

923
01:13:55,854 --> 01:13:57,287
Put the phone down!

924
01:13:58,014 --> 01:13:59,003
It was Frank.

925
01:13:59,214 --> 01:14:00,772
-He didn't do it!
-Sure he did!

926
01:14:01,014 --> 01:14:03,005
You got more than a backdoor romance.

927
01:14:03,254 --> 01:14:06,087
He pimped you out to Carter.
We're going to the police.

928
01:14:06,894 --> 01:14:11,126
Why don't you scream, so I can tell
the police about your boyfriend!

929
01:14:11,334 --> 01:14:13,006
Frank is my brother!

930
01:14:16,454 --> 01:14:19,048
Our mother is Creole.
We have different fathers.

931
01:14:20,414 --> 01:14:21,813
Mine is white.

932
01:14:23,414 --> 01:14:25,006
That's what Terell has on me.

933
01:14:26,614 --> 01:14:29,208
So far I've been able
to keep Frank out of this.

934
01:14:29,454 --> 01:14:30,807
Who killed Coretta?

935
01:14:32,094 --> 01:14:35,450
It was an accident. She wanted
to sell the pictures to Terell.

936
01:14:35,654 --> 01:14:38,009
Who killed her, goddamn it?

937
01:14:39,054 --> 01:14:41,045
I asked Joppy to scare her.

938
01:14:41,694 --> 01:14:42,729
Joppy?

939
01:14:43,614 --> 01:14:45,605
I didn't mean to hurt anybody.

940
01:14:46,414 --> 01:14:48,086
I didn't mean to hurt anybody.

941
01:14:48,454 --> 01:14:51,491
But Todd had to pull out
of the election because of me.

942
01:14:51,734 --> 01:14:54,885
His family really wanted us
to get married, but--

943
01:14:58,534 --> 01:14:59,933
I'll be a son of a bitch.

944
01:15:00,134 --> 01:15:00,964
Get her.

945
01:15:07,014 --> 01:15:08,413
Come on.

946
01:15:10,094 --> 01:15:12,164
-Where are the pictures?
-I don't know.

947
01:15:13,094 --> 01:15:14,607
Get her in the car.

948
01:15:16,614 --> 01:15:17,410
Come on!

949
01:15:17,694 --> 01:15:20,003
Who we gonna give up
to cover this shit?

950
01:15:46,534 --> 01:15:50,447
I woke up Mouse and told him to drive
Dupree's car to 34th and Central.

951
01:15:50,654 --> 01:15:53,532
It had come to me in less time
than it takes to think.:

952
01:15:53,894 --> 01:15:57,967
They were taking her someplace more
deserted than Albright's office...

953
01:15:58,174 --> 01:16:00,290
... where there would be no witnesses.

954
01:16:00,534 --> 01:16:02,923
And I was being left alive
to take the fall.

955
01:16:18,894 --> 01:16:21,010
Give me one of them guns you got.

956
01:16:21,494 --> 01:16:25,248
Start up my car, keep it hot.
I'm coming out fast.

957
01:16:52,654 --> 01:16:53,769
Let's go.

958
01:16:54,174 --> 01:16:56,005
Let's go. Let's go!

959
01:16:56,574 --> 01:16:58,451
I'll blow your face off.
Let's go!

960
01:16:58,654 --> 01:16:59,928
Shut up!

961
01:17:03,694 --> 01:17:05,605
-What the hell you doing?
-Shut up!

962
01:17:07,054 --> 01:17:08,282
What is this?

963
01:17:10,174 --> 01:17:11,653
You drive, Mouse.

964
01:17:22,694 --> 01:17:25,049
Albright's gonna kill the girl.

965
01:17:25,254 --> 01:17:27,563
Now tell me where it is
and get it right.

966
01:17:27,774 --> 01:17:30,368
Get it right, Joppy.
Get it right.

967
01:17:30,574 --> 01:17:32,292
There's a cabin.

968
01:17:32,654 --> 01:17:34,406
That's all I know.
There's a cabin.

969
01:17:34,654 --> 01:17:37,168
-Where?
-It's in Malibu on Route 9.

970
01:17:37,374 --> 01:17:39,410
Make a right turn at the alley.

971
01:17:43,814 --> 01:17:45,452
This is where he'll be, right?

972
01:17:45,654 --> 01:17:47,372
-I guess so.
-Don't be guessing!

973
01:17:47,574 --> 01:17:51,806
He done this kind of thing
out there before, so I guess so.

974
01:17:52,374 --> 01:17:54,171
I thought y'all were friends.

975
01:17:54,494 --> 01:17:55,973
He killed Coretta.

976
01:17:56,694 --> 01:17:58,013
You lying.

977
01:17:58,214 --> 01:18:00,091
I ain't done nothing like that.

978
01:18:04,174 --> 01:18:06,244
Hold on!
We need him, Mouse!

979
01:18:06,454 --> 01:18:08,604
The girl got $7000.

980
01:18:12,094 --> 01:18:12,890
What?

981
01:18:13,094 --> 01:18:16,211
The girl offered to pay me
$7000 for them pictures.

982
01:18:16,414 --> 01:18:17,733
Oh, my God!

983
01:18:18,494 --> 01:18:19,688
Oh, my goodness!

984
01:18:19,894 --> 01:18:20,690
Oh, my God!

985
01:18:38,574 --> 01:18:40,212
How much further is it?

986
01:18:40,614 --> 01:18:42,206
We coming up on it.

987
01:19:01,734 --> 01:19:04,009
There's rope in the trunk.
Tie him up.

988
01:19:04,254 --> 01:19:05,607
Yeah, all right.

989
01:19:13,214 --> 01:19:14,693
Man, come on.

990
01:19:15,214 --> 01:19:19,002
The girl is lying if she told you
I killed that woman.

991
01:19:19,734 --> 01:19:21,486
Who says she told me?

992
01:19:27,054 --> 01:19:28,931
I'm gonna shoot him now, okay?

993
01:19:29,214 --> 01:19:30,203
No, don't.

994
01:19:31,494 --> 01:19:32,609
Don't shoot.

995
01:20:22,694 --> 01:20:25,447
Help me! Help me!

996
01:20:35,214 --> 01:20:36,408
Shut up!

997
01:20:42,774 --> 01:20:44,810
Now, you tell me
where the pictures are.

998
01:20:45,054 --> 01:20:47,409
I don't want to hurt you.
Tell me.

999
01:20:47,654 --> 01:20:49,053
Where are the pictures?

1000
01:20:49,254 --> 01:20:52,849
-Easy has them.
-You said he had nothing to do with it.

1001
01:20:53,614 --> 01:20:55,332
I was lying.

1002
01:20:57,734 --> 01:20:58,769
Lying?

1003
01:21:00,294 --> 01:21:02,012
Yeah, you a liar?

1004
01:21:05,814 --> 01:21:09,011
I know you lie.
You lie about being a nigger?

1005
01:21:11,294 --> 01:21:12,613
Tell me the truth.

1006
01:21:14,054 --> 01:21:16,045
What part of you is nigger?
Your leg?

1007
01:21:16,294 --> 01:21:18,569
Your arm a nigger?
Maybe your face?

1008
01:21:22,254 --> 01:21:24,006
What part of you is nigger?

1009
01:21:25,654 --> 01:21:27,212
You know what I'm gonna do?

1010
01:21:28,174 --> 01:21:29,209
Please, no!

1011
01:21:29,574 --> 01:21:31,804
I'm gonna burn it out of you.

1012
01:22:30,694 --> 01:22:32,412
Easy, is that you?

1013
01:23:42,894 --> 01:23:44,407
He gone, man.

1014
01:23:49,574 --> 01:23:50,768
Gone.

1015
01:24:00,414 --> 01:24:01,813
You all right?

1016
01:24:03,974 --> 01:24:05,202
Can you walk?

1017
01:24:05,414 --> 01:24:07,006
Come on, let's go.

1018
01:24:25,214 --> 01:24:26,693
Where's Joppy?

1019
01:24:29,814 --> 01:24:30,849
Where Joppy?

1020
01:24:31,614 --> 01:24:33,366
He right there.

1021
01:24:44,414 --> 01:24:45,529
What happened?

1022
01:24:46,294 --> 01:24:48,683
I ain't had no time
to be tying him up.

1023
01:24:49,294 --> 01:24:50,204
What?

1024
01:24:51,054 --> 01:24:52,453
You said don't shoot him.

1025
01:24:52,654 --> 01:24:54,610
-That's right.
-Well, I didn't.

1026
01:24:54,814 --> 01:24:56,167
I choked him.

1027
01:24:57,014 --> 01:24:57,969
What?

1028
01:24:58,374 --> 01:25:02,003
How am I gonna help you out
if I'm here fooling around with him?

1029
01:25:05,694 --> 01:25:09,209
If you ain't want him killed,
why'd you leave him with me?

1030
01:25:15,094 --> 01:25:17,005
Come on. We got to go, Easy.

1031
01:25:20,014 --> 01:25:22,209
Easy, come on. Let's go now.

1032
01:25:41,094 --> 01:25:42,322
Listen...

1033
01:25:42,894 --> 01:25:44,566
...what about that dude Frank?

1034
01:25:44,774 --> 01:25:47,766
-I can run by and kill him before I go.
-No, Mouse.

1035
01:25:47,974 --> 01:25:49,009
You sure?

1036
01:25:53,574 --> 01:25:54,689
Look.

1037
01:25:55,374 --> 01:25:56,443
Here's your half.

1038
01:25:56,654 --> 01:26:00,203
I know you's too big a fool
to take it from her yourself.

1039
01:26:00,694 --> 01:26:04,050
If you need somebody to run
them streets with, give me a call.

1040
01:26:04,294 --> 01:26:06,808
You know how to put money
in a nigger's pocket.

1041
01:26:26,294 --> 01:26:29,127
What upset them the most
was that I didn't tell them.

1042
01:26:30,054 --> 01:26:33,046
Then Terell threatened
to go public about my mother.

1043
01:26:33,254 --> 01:26:35,609
That just added insult to injury.

1044
01:26:36,294 --> 01:26:37,727
When Todd sees the pictures...

1045
01:26:37,934 --> 01:26:40,243
...there'll be nothing
in the way of our marriage.

1046
01:26:40,454 --> 01:26:44,208
-Are you sure?
-Terell doesn't want to go to jail.

1047
01:26:44,694 --> 01:26:46,605
I'm not talking about Terell.

1048
01:26:48,054 --> 01:26:50,807
Todd and I are very much in love,
and in the end...

1049
01:26:52,214 --> 01:26:54,409
...his family just wants him
to be happy.

1050
01:26:58,974 --> 01:27:02,762
Daphne had gotten the money
out of a locker at the YWCA.

1051
01:27:02,974 --> 01:27:05,568
It was money she had gotten
from Carter's family.

1052
01:27:05,974 --> 01:27:07,805
$30, 000...

1053
01:27:08,374 --> 01:27:09,966
... to leave town.

1054
01:27:10,694 --> 01:27:13,572
She was convinced
her Negro blood didn't matter...

1055
01:27:13,814 --> 01:27:15,964
...now that Terell couldn't use it...

1056
01:27:16,174 --> 01:27:18,404
... to keep Carter
out of the mayor's race.

1057
01:27:19,374 --> 01:27:21,888
She was in love and
couldn't see for dreaming...

1058
01:27:22,534 --> 01:27:24,684
...any better than
the rest of us, I guess.

1059
01:27:25,174 --> 01:27:28,450
Even though we had fought a war
to keep the world free...

1060
01:27:28,694 --> 01:27:31,003
... the colour line in America
work both ways.

1061
01:27:31,214 --> 01:27:33,603
Even a rich white man
like Todd Carter...

1062
01:27:34,294 --> 01:27:36,046
... was afraid to cross it.

1063
01:27:36,294 --> 01:27:38,012
-Don't walk away.
-Damn you!

1064
01:27:38,854 --> 01:27:39,923
Wait.

1065
01:27:42,094 --> 01:27:43,049
Wait.

1066
01:27:49,374 --> 01:27:50,602
Please!

1067
01:28:12,014 --> 01:28:14,369
Here's the $800 that I owe you.

1068
01:28:15,374 --> 01:28:17,205
And thank you for protecting her.

1069
01:28:19,654 --> 01:28:21,212
You have some pictures.

1070
01:28:33,774 --> 01:28:35,810
That puts you back in the race.

1071
01:28:38,014 --> 01:28:40,403
I'll need you to do
something for me too.

1072
01:28:42,654 --> 01:28:43,803
I know.

1073
01:28:44,294 --> 01:28:47,206
You'll have no trouble
with the police.

1074
01:28:47,414 --> 01:28:48,369
It's a promise.

1075
01:28:54,614 --> 01:28:55,888
Thank you.

1076
01:29:02,214 --> 01:29:03,613
Just so you know...

1077
01:29:05,814 --> 01:29:07,406
...l do love her.

1078
01:29:51,094 --> 01:29:53,005
You want me to walk you inside?

1079
01:30:14,574 --> 01:30:16,644
I dropped her off
at her brother's...

1080
01:30:17,014 --> 01:30:19,084
...a four-plex on Dinker Street.

1081
01:30:19,694 --> 01:30:21,764
She told me her story
on the way home...

1082
01:30:21,974 --> 01:30:24,044
... Iike a sinner
who wanted to confess.

1083
01:30:24,294 --> 01:30:27,570
Her name was Ruby Hanks
from Lake Charles, Louisiana.

1084
01:30:28,014 --> 01:30:31,404
I suppose all she really wanted
was a place to fit in.

1085
01:30:32,334 --> 01:30:34,973
A few days later,
my conscience got the best of me...

1086
01:30:35,214 --> 01:30:38,172
...and I went by her place
to bring back her money.

1087
01:30:38,694 --> 01:30:41,208
I was kind of excited
about seeing her again.

1088
01:30:41,814 --> 01:30:43,293
But when I got there...

1089
01:30:43,734 --> 01:30:46,202
...she and her brother
had picked up and gone.

1090
01:31:26,094 --> 01:31:27,812
Find a job yet?

1091
01:31:28,174 --> 01:31:29,926
I ain't studying no job, Odell.

1092
01:31:30,454 --> 01:31:32,251
No job? How you gonna live?

1093
01:31:32,454 --> 01:31:35,605
I got a little money saved up.
I'll invest in real estate.

1094
01:31:35,974 --> 01:31:39,250
-Maybe go into business for myself.
-What kind of business?

1095
01:31:39,494 --> 01:31:41,371
Private investigating.

1096
01:31:42,054 --> 01:31:43,453
You get in trouble doing that.

1097
01:31:43,654 --> 01:31:46,009
Well, like a man told me once:

1098
01:31:46,694 --> 01:31:49,413
"Step out your door,
you're already in trouble.

1099
01:31:49,654 --> 01:31:52,327
Only thing is, if you're mixed up
at the top or not."

1100
01:31:54,334 --> 01:31:55,813
I guess you're right.

1101
01:32:00,494 --> 01:32:04,726
If you got a friend that you know
does bad things, real bad things...

1102
01:32:05,374 --> 01:32:08,810
...and you still keep him as a friend,
knowing what he's like...

1103
01:32:10,494 --> 01:32:11,404
...is that wrong?

1104
01:32:14,014 --> 01:32:15,811
All you got is your friends.

1105
01:32:19,014 --> 01:32:22,051
What are you doing?
You get out of my yard!

1106
01:32:22,494 --> 01:32:23,483
Get away!

1107
01:32:23,694 --> 01:32:26,413
That fool knocked down
two of my trees. Get away!

1108
01:32:28,174 --> 01:32:29,368
Get on!

1109
01:32:32,894 --> 01:32:34,213
You all right?

1110
01:33:20,934 --> 01:33:23,050
I thought about what
he said about friends...

1111
01:33:23,254 --> 01:33:25,051
...and it made sense to me.

1112
01:33:25,294 --> 01:33:28,411
Odell goes to church every Sunday,
so he would know.

1113
01:33:29,014 --> 01:33:33,212
Later, he challenged me to dominoes.
Now, what he do that for?

1114
01:33:33,774 --> 01:33:36,766
We got to talking about Texas
and fooled around...

1115
01:33:37,014 --> 01:33:39,164
...and drunk a quart of whiskey.

1116
01:33:39,374 --> 01:33:43,572
And I forgot all about Daphne Monet,
DeWitt Albright, Carter and them.

1117
01:33:44,214 --> 01:33:46,045
And I sat with my friend...

1118
01:33:46,254 --> 01:33:47,892
... on my porch...

1119
01:33:48,414 --> 01:33:49,972
...at my house...

1120
01:33:50,694 --> 01:33:53,003
...and we laughed a long time.
