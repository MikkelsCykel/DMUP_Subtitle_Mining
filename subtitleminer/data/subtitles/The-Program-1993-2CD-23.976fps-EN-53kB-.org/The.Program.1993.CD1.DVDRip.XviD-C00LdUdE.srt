How could you do that?

434
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:41,696
- You could've killed us!
- Woo!

435
00:27:43,408 --> 00:27:45,342
<i>[Joe]</i>
<i>Uh, that could've been ugly.</i>

436
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:48,846
- Goddamn!
- I've done that
100 times before.

437
00:27:48,914 --> 00:27:52,873
- Never with anybody on the back,
but it was fun, wasrt it?
- [Gasping]

438
00:27:55,253 --> 00:27:57,687
You just wanted to scare me.
Are you happy now?

439
00:27:57,756 --> 00:28:01,283
Yeah. Actually, the scream
was even better than I thought.

440
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,352
You got just about every dog
in hearing distance
wantir to mate with you.

441
00:28:04,429 --> 00:28:07,125
<i>[Dogs Barking Faintly]</i>

442
00:28:10,969 --> 00:28:13,233
Do you come here a lot?

443
00:28:13,305 --> 00:28:16,274
Now and then.
Why?

444
00:28:16,341 --> 00:28:19,401
Well, it's not exactly
a campus favorite.

445
00:28:19,478 --> 00:28:22,879
This is more like
hidir out.

446
00:28:22,948 --> 00:28:24,882
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Nice shot.!</i>

447
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:28,283
I like to go places
where nobody knows me.

448
00:28:28,353 --> 00:28:30,844
Why, is this
too low-rent for you?

449
00:28:30,922 --> 00:28:33,117
No, no.

450
00:28:33,191 --> 00:28:36,058
- My father owned a place like this.
- Your father?

451
00:28:36,128 --> 00:28:40,064
- Mm-hmm.
- What, you mean he owned
a chain of these?

452
00:28:40,132 --> 00:28:45,399
No. You know,
not everybody who plays tennis
grew up in a country club, Joe.

453
00:28:47,372 --> 00:28:50,773
My dad could never afford
to send me here.

454
00:28:50,842 --> 00:28:55,506
When I hurt my knee I was afraid
I was gonna lose my scholarship.

455
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:58,014
So, you're a full-ticket jock,
just like me?

456
00:28:58,083 --> 00:29:00,278
Yeah.
Are you disappointed?

457
00:29:02,487 --> 00:29:05,115
No, I just never went out
with a jock before.

458
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:09,524
Huh! Is that what's goir on here?
We're goir out?

459
00:29:09,594 --> 00:29:13,496
What do you think?
Come on.

460
00:29:17,669 --> 00:29:21,036
I think you're, ah,
crazy for jeopardizing
your scholarship...

461
00:29:21,106 --> 00:29:24,269
and a pro career
by jumping motorcycles
off of highways.

462
00:29:26,078 --> 00:29:28,444
Just tryir
to keep my edge.

463

- <i> If you don't know me by now </i>

See, the guys, they...

465
00:29:35,387 --> 00:29:38,823
They look to me 'cause they think
I'll do anything.

466
00:29:41,193 --> 00:29:44,162
If I lose that,
then I'm just another guy.

467
00:29:44,229 --> 00:29:46,527
Then we'd get
the shit kicked out of us.

468

<i>If you don't know me by now </i>

- <i> No, you won't </i>
- You scare me, Joe.

471
00:29:57,576 --> 00:30:05,176
<i>Ah-hey</i>
<i>If you don't know me by now </i>

The keys.

474
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:27,766
Look, I told you. During the season,
no unnecessary risks.

475
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:31,570
<i>Any guy that's up</i>

476
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:38,014
Thanks. Good night.

477
00:30:43,722 --> 00:30:46,316
Now, using the things
we worked on yesterday,
I want you to write...

478
00:30:46,391 --> 00:30:49,952
a two or three page
essay about some aspect
of your life...

479
00:30:50,028 --> 00:30:52,963
other than football.

480
00:30:53,031 --> 00:30:56,091
What's in my life
besides football?

481
00:30:56,168 --> 00:30:58,295
I don't know.
Your father.

482
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:01,305
You could write
about your dad.

483
00:31:04,209 --> 00:31:08,373
I don't know
much about him.

484
00:31:08,446 --> 00:31:12,143
He was off in Detroit
workir in a car plant
when I was born.

485
00:31:14,686 --> 00:31:17,382
Got laid off.

486
00:31:17,455 --> 00:31:21,983
Tried to rob a liquor store
to get us some money.

487
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,994
Got caught.

488
00:31:26,364 --> 00:31:29,595
Died in prison.
Some kind of heart problem.

489
00:31:29,668 --> 00:31:35,004
Well, maybe you can write
about your mother.

490
00:31:37,309 --> 00:31:41,575
She was usually
workir two jobs.

491
00:31:41,646 --> 00:31:46,640
One night she stopped
at a grocery store
to get me some root beer.

492
00:31:46,718 --> 00:31:50,916
She got caught
in gang cross fire.

493
00:31:50,989 --> 00:31:52,923
Shot three times.

494
00:31:52,991 --> 00:31:57,018
Died on the way
to the hospital.

495
00:31:57,095 --> 00:31:59,154
Want me to write
about that?

496
00:31:59,231 --> 00:32:01,165
No.

497
00:32:01,233 --> 00:32:03,929
That's good,
'cause ain't none of that true.

498
00:32:04,002 --> 00:32:07,802
Gee whiz, Darnell!

499
00:32:07,872 --> 00:32:12,138
What kind of a thing is that
to do to somebody? It's not funny.

500
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:14,974
I had you goir,
didn't I?

501
00:32:15,046 --> 00:32:19,346
No, you did not have me goir!
Why would you make up
something like that?

502
00:32:19,417 --> 00:32:21,885
Sounded more interesting
than the truth.

503
00:32:21,953 --> 00:32:24,387
<i>I never knew</i>
<i>who my dad was.</i>

504
00:32:24,456 --> 00:32:30,019
When I was 12, my mother
took a vacation in Chicago
and never came back.

505
00:32:33,331 --> 00:32:38,496
Well, then, maybe just this once,
you can write about football.

506
00:32:41,506 --> 00:32:44,441
I've seen a lot of
shitty things in life, Autumn.

507
00:32:44,509 --> 00:32:46,977
That's why I know
when I see something good.

508
00:32:49,714 --> 00:32:53,150
Okay, let's review the chapter
I read you yesterday.

509
00:32:53,218 --> 00:32:56,847
Which two city-states
fought in the Punic Wars?

510
00:32:56,921 --> 00:33:00,948
I don't know.
Detroit and Buffalo?

511
00:33:01,026 --> 00:33:05,622
- Oh, come on, Alvin.
You're gonna be tested on this.
- [Chuckling]

512
00:33:05,697 --> 00:33:08,757
<i>Rookies, you pay attention.</i>
<i>This is what I expect</i>
<i>out of you. Alvin, you ready?</i>

513
00:33:08,833 --> 00:33:11,165
- Yes, sir.
- All right, this is
Mississippi State's offensive set.

514
00:33:11,236 --> 00:33:14,262
Second and two on our own 24.
What defensive set might we call?

515
00:33:14,339 --> 00:33:16,830
Eagle, zipper, hero,
unless the setback shifts into the I.

516
00:33:16,908 --> 00:33:20,071
<i>Good.</i>
<i>Third and seven.</i>

517
00:33:20,145 --> 00:33:22,409
- Oakie, thunder, lion.
- What's your assignment?

518
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,675
Kill the quarterback.

519
00:33:24,749 --> 00:33:28,378
<i>Hit the tight end so hard</i>
<i>his girlfriend dies.</i>

520
00:33:28,453 --> 00:33:31,752
- Kill everybody.
- <i>There you go.</i>

521
00:33:31,823 --> 00:33:34,257
Ready?

522
00:33:36,328 --> 00:33:38,796
[Grunting]

523
00:33:39,864 --> 00:33:43,231

00:33:43,301 --> 00:33:47,465
<i>Very nice game.</i>

<i>Well, you owe me a dinner.</i>
<i>But you're takirit real well.</i>

526
00:33:54,179 --> 00:33:56,477
Now, George Washington
won a few skirmishes,

527
00:33:56,548 --> 00:33:59,039
<i>but he never actually</i>
<i>won a real battle.</i>

- How do you figure?
- [Grunts]

716

Griffers goir

She likes that light-skinned
respectable shit.

718

You? You just
a ghetto toy.

719
00:45:50,761 --> 00:45:54,162
- Can I have this one?
- Hey, I don't think so.

720
00:45:54,231 --> 00:45:57,894
What you worried about, boy?
You haven't lost your
startirjob just yet.

00:45:57,968 --> 00:46:01,529
- Hey, you got a problem, buddy?
- Ray, just one, okay?

722
00:46:01,605 --> 00:46:05,564
All right, just one.

723
00:46:05,643 --> 00:46:09,977
Take it easy, Darnell.
You are putting me in
a very awkward situation here.

724
00:46:10,047 --> 00:46:12,208
<i>[Darnell] I had a little encouragement</i>
<i>along the way.</i>

725
00:46:12,283 --> 00:46:14,877
Listen, I want
to see you, Autumn.

726
00:46:14,952 --> 00:46:18,945
Not in a study hall;
not like your student.

727
00:46:19,023 --> 00:46:23,426
- I want to be taken seriously.
- Darnell, I do take you seriously.

728
00:46:23,494 --> 00:46:25,724
But if you haven't noticed,
I'm still with Ray...

729
00:46:25,796 --> 00:46:28,390
and I cannot just go paradir around
town with you.

730
00:46:28,466 --> 00:46:31,902
We don't have to go paradir.
We can go someplace different;

731
00:46:31,969 --> 00:46:34,904
- someplace that nobody'll see us.
- [Sighs]

732
00:46:38,242 --> 00:46:41,700
Why am I even considering this?
It's crazy.

733
00:46:41,779 --> 00:46:45,613
Hey, genius. You all caught up
on your arithmetic?

734
00:46:45,683 --> 00:46:50,916
Yeah, yeah. You only gained,
uh, 37 yards on 12 carries.

735
00:46:50,988 --> 00:46:53,923
- Hey, hey! Come on!
- You want some of this? Come on!

- Come on!
- Cool.

738
00:47:00,931 --> 00:47:03,399
Just calm it,
buddy, Darnell.

739
00:47:03,467 --> 00:47:05,935
<i>So much for</i>
<i>team unity, huh?</i>

740
00:47:06,003 --> 00:47:08,665

to do with that, did ya?

741
00:47:08,739 --> 00:47:11,503
- Hell no! You know me.
- Chshh! Right!

742
00:47:11,575 --> 00:47:13,543
Come here.
We need to talk.

743

Look, I'm gettir
a little sick of that
asshole, Autumn.

744
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:17,914
I don't like you
hangir out with him.
It's embarrassing.

745
00:47:17,982 --> 00:47:20,746
- I don't hang out with him.
I tutor him.
- Then have him get another tutor.

746
00:47:20,818 --> 00:47:23,116
I can't do that.
I promised him I'd help him pass...

747
00:47:23,187 --> 00:47:26,213
his qualifying exam,
and I can't go
bailir out on him now.

748
00:47:26,290 --> 00:47:29,123
What the hell difference does it make?
They'll grease him
through no matter what he does.

749
00:47:29,193 --> 00:47:31,218
Nobody's ever gonna see
that boy graduate.

750
00:47:31,295 --> 00:47:33,855
Hey, don't tell me
you've fallen for this guy.

751
00:47:33,931 --> 00:47:36,263
He's nothir.
He's just another gangbanger with speed.

752
00:47:36,333 --> 00:47:40,201
I'm tryir to help him out.
What're you more afraid of, Ray?

753
00:47:40,271 --> 00:47:43,638
Losir your girl
or your position?

754
00:47:43,707 --> 00:47:47,939
Maybe you better think
a little bit more about
what you're in danger of losing.

755
00:47:48,012 --> 00:47:51,539

- I think next time we'll go bowling.

<i>Rocky,</i> you know.

764
00:48:25,149 --> 00:48:27,811
I always used to wonder
how a guy...

who's supposed to be
such a great athlete
was skatir so bad.

Thank you, Darnell. This is fun.
Well, sort of fun.

Nah, you were good

Well, actually,
this isn't my first time.

771
00:48:50,641 --> 00:48:53,474
My dad took me skating once
when I was little.

for ESU, didn't he?
- Yeah. How'd you know?

- Sorry?

784
00:49:56,840 --> 00:50:00,241
I mean, you weaken my authority
with the players.

785
00:50:00,311 --> 00:50:02,871
It looks like I'm runnir a dirty pro...

I thought
that he loved me.

that I'm real sorry about this
whole thing with Louanne.

<i>Shut up.</i>

my family.

805

So, as of now, you are no longer
a member of this university

<i>But if all you wanna do</i>
<i>is fake your way through,</i>

find yourself another tutor
and waste her time.

813
00:51:50,854 --> 00:51:55,120
Autumn, we just had a good time.
Why you gettir all riled up
about one test?

more commensurate with my abilities.
