1
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:16,723
Resync: Xenzai[NEF]

2
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:28,621
Oh, my God. Stuart.

3
00:01:29,175 --> 00:01:31,694
- What is it?
- Tom's grades finally posted.

4
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:36,406
Look.

5
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:39,287
- Wonderful. Not one "A".
- No.

6
00:01:39,352 --> 00:01:40,856
Or a " B."

7
00:01:41,303 --> 00:01:43,285
Not even in Health.

8
00:01:45,527 --> 00:01:48,015
- What the--
- That was just a "D".

9
00:01:48,088 --> 00:01:49,936
How are these changing?

10
00:01:55,287 --> 00:01:57,588
One word, and you're dead.

11
00:01:59,798 --> 00:02:02,963
Are you crazy?
If Dad catches you, he's gonna kill you.

12
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,366
Dad's not gonna catch me.

13
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,147
I don't get it.
What do you see in that guy?

14
00:02:08,214 --> 00:02:10,221
Bye, babe!

15
00:02:10,294 --> 00:02:13,108
You mean, other than the fact
that he's good-looking, sweet...

16
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:17,517
sensitive, romantic, funny
and ridiculously athletic?

17
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:22,324
- Dad's coming, and he's mad.
- At who?

18
00:02:22,389 --> 00:02:24,528
- Tom.
- Tom!

19
00:02:28,118 --> 00:02:31,248
- What? - If you're smart enough
to hack into the school Web site...

20
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,172
then you are smart enough to pass math.

21
00:02:33,238 --> 00:02:37,066
Do you think Bethany got accepted to Michigan
by screwing around all the time?

22
00:02:37,141 --> 00:02:40,457
Of course not.
She got in 'cause she's perfect.

23
00:02:40,532 --> 00:02:44,177
No. Your sister worked her tail off,
and that's exactly what I expect from you.

24
00:02:44,244 --> 00:02:46,153
Yeah. You're right, Dad.

25
00:02:46,229 --> 00:02:48,117
I-I-I don't deserve a family vacation.

26
00:02:48,181 --> 00:02:50,089
I should stay home tomorrow, learn my lesson.

27
00:02:50,165 --> 00:02:52,946
Oh, no, no. I am not
taking that bait, kiddo.

28
00:02:53,014 --> 00:02:56,788
This isn't you. The bad attitude, the grades.
What is going on?

29
00:02:56,853 --> 00:02:59,274
Nothing.

30
00:02:59,348 --> 00:03:02,926
I blame all this
for coming between this right here.

31
00:03:02,996 --> 00:03:05,898
Some good old-fashioned no-tech--

32
00:03:07,444 --> 00:03:10,410
family togetherness is exactly what we need.

33
00:03:11,636 --> 00:03:14,189
So get some sleep.
We're hitting the road at sunup.

34
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,432
Oh, and you guys too.

35
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:39,024
Hannah. Please, next time,
you ride the hump, okay?

36
00:03:39,091 --> 00:03:41,841
I barf in the middle. Remember?

37
00:03:59,762 --> 00:04:02,380
And that's the farm report.
In other news, it looks like...

38
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,003
there will be more than just fireworks
in the sky tonight...

39
00:04:05,074 --> 00:04:08,369
as an unexpected meteor shower adds a little
excitement to our area this holiday weekend.

40
00:04:08,434 --> 00:04:12,175
- Very exciting. We're in for a little bit
of a show.  - That'll be beautiful, guys.

41
00:04:12,241 --> 00:04:15,721
Better wear hats tonight.
We don't want our heads catching on fire.

42
00:04:23,538 --> 00:04:25,512
- Hey.
- Your boy toy is a complete idiot.

43
00:04:25,584 --> 00:04:27,690
Ricky is not a boy toy.

44
00:04:27,761 --> 00:04:29,801
We're in a mature, loving relationship.

45
00:04:29,874 --> 00:04:33,004
Why don't we talk in a few years
when you have a clue what dating's all about?

46
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:37,349
- Like Ricky has a clue?    - One more word
about Ricky, and I swear to God I'll kill you.

47
00:04:37,424 --> 00:04:40,719
Okay. That is enough.
Knock it off, you guys.

48
00:04:40,785 --> 00:04:42,694
We're almost there.

49
00:05:00,336 --> 00:05:02,573
And there's the pool. See ya!

50
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,043
We beat Uncle Nate! Yeah!

51
00:05:07,311 --> 00:05:09,481
I got it, Tom. Don't worry.

52
00:05:09,552 --> 00:05:11,886
- Nice, huh?
- Great, yes. I'll grab that.

53
00:05:11,952 --> 00:05:15,977
I hope there was a discount for booking us
into the most boring spot in the whole country.

54
00:05:16,047 --> 00:05:19,114
We're only a stone's throw away from
at least a half dozen top-notch fishing lakes.

55
00:05:19,184 --> 00:05:22,795
Are we near a time machine so we can go back
5 years to when I thought fishing was cool?

56
00:05:22,863 --> 00:05:26,954
Hey, I bought us all new Sidestab reels.
Anti-Reverse technology.

57
00:05:28,206 --> 00:05:29,800
Lame.

58
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:42,286
So lame.

59
00:06:15,788 --> 00:06:17,411
Nice landing, Nate.

60
00:06:17,773 --> 00:06:19,683
Told you I could fishtail this thing.

61
00:06:19,758 --> 00:06:22,309
Nice try, Nate, but you just missed my kids.

62
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:25,414
But he did almost give
your mother a heart attack.

63
00:06:25,484 --> 00:06:27,427
- Again.
- Nana!

64
00:06:27,501 --> 00:06:29,355
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, darling.

65
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:32,289
- Nana!
- Yes, sweetheart!

66
00:06:34,284 --> 00:06:36,171
- I got you a little treat.
- You did?

67
00:06:36,235 --> 00:06:38,473
Yes, I did. Here we go.

68
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,204
Thank you.

69
00:06:40,939 --> 00:06:44,071
- It's so good to see you.
I missed you. - Hey. We're here.

70
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:49,002
Well, one of the Pearson brothers
came to party.

71
00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:51,973
- Are those even legal here?
- No.

72
00:06:52,619 --> 00:06:55,205
Here! Come on, Stu! Let's get him!

73
00:06:55,276 --> 00:06:58,091
- Nate, stop it! I'll tell Mom.
- Tickle him! Tickle your uncle!

74
00:06:58,156 --> 00:07:01,024
- Spin him faster, Nate!
- Get his shirt off!

75
00:07:01,098 --> 00:07:02,473
Mom!

76
00:07:03,979 --> 00:07:05,736
Stuey's crying for Mommy!

77
00:07:10,283 --> 00:07:12,323
Twins, in here.

78
00:07:12,395 --> 00:07:14,566
- Hey, guys.
- Put my bags on the bed.

79
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:16,609
Sir, yes, sir.

80
00:07:16,683 --> 00:07:19,846
- Trying to be a wise guy?
- No. No. Definitely not. Don't provoke him.

81
00:07:19,914 --> 00:07:22,085
Good. Now, get these out of here.

82
00:07:23,113 --> 00:07:24,608
Wait a minute.
Why do you get the best room?

83
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,854
I was here first.

84
00:07:26,026 --> 00:07:27,970
- I'm here now.
- I'm older.

85
00:07:28,235 --> 00:07:29,734
And I'm bigger.

86
00:07:30,761 --> 00:07:33,576
Did you... grow since Christmas?

87
00:07:33,642 --> 00:07:37,188
2 inches, cuz. I can tag a stop sign
without even having to jump.

88
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:40,323
How's Mathletes?

89
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:42,783
I don't do Mathletes anymore.

90
00:07:42,858 --> 00:07:45,891
- You tired of getting beat up?
- Tom!

91
00:07:45,961 --> 00:07:49,823
Get down here and help us unload! Now!

92
00:07:49,898 --> 00:07:51,808
Close my door on the way out.

93
00:08:08,103 --> 00:08:11,552
- Surprise, surprise, princess.
- Ricky, what are you doing here?

94
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,513
I'm just stopping by for the afternoon...

95
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:15,300
or maybe the night.

96
00:08:23,272 --> 00:08:25,606
- What's that?
- What's what?

97
00:08:25,768 --> 00:08:27,155
- Ricky!
- Hey!

98
00:08:29,031 --> 00:08:30,883
- Watch out for the car.
- I can't believe you're here.

99
00:08:30,952 --> 00:08:32,861
Well, you're my girl friend now...

100
00:08:32,935 --> 00:08:35,237
so there's nothing I wouldn't do for you.

101
00:08:35,687 --> 00:08:37,475
Now, give papa some sugar.

102
00:08:37,544 --> 00:08:40,162
Bethany. Please don't give papa sugar.

103
00:08:42,184 --> 00:08:44,191
Mr. and Mrs. P!

104
00:08:44,264 --> 00:08:46,947
- Ricky!
- Hey, Ricky! What a surprise.

105
00:08:47,015 --> 00:08:49,503
- I got you a little housewarming gift.
- That is so sweet.

106
00:08:49,575 --> 00:08:52,390
- Isn't he sweet?
- Yes. They're beautiful.

107
00:08:52,455 --> 00:08:54,560
Those are gorgeous. Yeah.
Very patriotic too, huh?

108
00:08:54,631 --> 00:08:56,517
Let's stick the flags in some water,
see if they grow.

109
00:08:56,582 --> 00:08:59,037
We can do that.
Do you want anything to eat or drink?

110
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:02,853
That is so sweet of you.
I really wish I could.

111
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:04,446
But my parents have
a lake house in Oaks town...

112
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:07,585
and I gotta get back before dark
in case my car breaks down again.

113
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:10,018
- Car trouble.
- Dad, why don't you--

114
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,811
why don't you take a look at it for Ricky?

115
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:14,115
Yeah, I don't mind getting my hands dirty.

116
00:09:14,182 --> 00:09:15,915
Try it again, Ricky.

117
00:09:16,453 --> 00:09:18,592
It's gotta be something obvious, Dad.

118
00:09:18,662 --> 00:09:21,826
I got to be honest with you.
Auto mechanics isn't really my thing.

119
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:24,960
Now, if this were a spreadsheet or a ledger,
I would be all over it, but--

120
00:09:25,222 --> 00:09:27,234
I'll tell you what, Ricky.
Stay here tonight...

121
00:09:27,302 --> 00:09:29,790
and then we'll take your car
to the shop in the morning.

122
00:09:29,862 --> 00:09:32,229
Mr. P, that's really considerate of you.

123
00:09:32,294 --> 00:09:33,919
- Well--
- Really? He can stay the night?

124
00:09:33,989 --> 00:09:36,377
- Yeah, in the den, on the couch.
- Of course.

125
00:09:36,454 --> 00:09:38,558
- No fooling around.
- Dad.

126
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:41,116
What a gas pipe.

127
00:09:41,189 --> 00:09:43,556
I know. Why can't they see that?

128
00:09:43,621 --> 00:09:45,628
Well, dude, parents are wired differently.

129
00:09:45,701 --> 00:09:49,412
Their brains are old, mushy,
fried from bad '80s music.

130
00:09:49,478 --> 00:09:51,387
That's why it's up to you, Thomas.

131
00:09:51,462 --> 00:09:54,047
You gotta defend your family honor,
like a man.

132
00:09:54,789 --> 00:09:58,717
I call it the Punisher.

133
00:09:58,788 --> 00:10:01,374
- Your dad bought you this?
- Perks of divorce.

134
00:10:01,445 --> 00:10:04,161
Never underestimate the power
of a grown man's guilt.

135
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:07,489
If we even mention Mom,
Nate drives us straight to the mall.

136
00:10:08,676 --> 00:10:11,710
She's all yours.
Don't be a wuss all your life.

137
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,983
I don't know, man.

138
00:10:17,091 --> 00:10:19,001
Take a look at that guy.

139
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:23,231
- Do you really want Ricky as your
brother-in-law?     - Waah, waah.

140
00:10:26,212 --> 00:10:27,968
Heck, no.

141
00:10:28,036 --> 00:10:30,905
Then let's go prune the family tree.

142
00:10:32,322 --> 00:10:34,462
I had so much fun last night, Ricky.

143
00:10:34,531 --> 00:10:39,899
Oh, yeah? Well, you know,
that's just the beginning.

144
00:10:39,971 --> 00:10:43,964
Man, the sun off the water and...
this lightweight cotton...

145
00:10:44,034 --> 00:10:48,508
is... so... constricting.

146
00:10:48,578 --> 00:10:50,750
I hate cotton.

147
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:54,266
Mind helping me with the lotion, babe?

148
00:10:59,043 --> 00:11:02,425
I'm thinking shooting my sister's
boyfriend isn't the best idea.

149
00:11:02,499 --> 00:11:05,815
This isn't about ideas. This is about action.

150
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:07,744
Don't think. Do.

151
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:10,940
I can't believe I'm even listening to you.
You're dressed like a shrub.

152
00:11:12,289 --> 00:11:14,744
-Just a little on my chest.
- Target is on the move.

153
00:11:14,817 --> 00:11:18,233
- Take him out before he reaches 2nd base.
- Nah. I don't think that--

154
00:11:25,505 --> 00:11:27,839
- Why did you do that?
- Shut up. You'll compromise our position.

155
00:11:30,433 --> 00:11:32,767
Oh, my God. She saw us.
What do we do? What do we do?

156
00:11:32,832 --> 00:11:36,607
Camo mode. Hunker down and blend.

157
00:11:38,817 --> 00:11:42,134
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- You shot my boyfriend.

158
00:11:42,209 --> 00:11:44,861
"Sorry" doesn't even touch that.
When, Tom?

159
00:11:44,929 --> 00:11:47,515
When are you gonna grow up
and stop being a total embarrassment?

160
00:11:48,673 --> 00:11:51,356
And that's why we use camo.

161
00:11:51,424 --> 00:11:53,399
Shut up, Jake.

162
00:11:55,744 --> 00:11:57,238
Are you gonna be okay?

163
00:11:57,313 --> 00:11:59,319
I don't know what you were thinking.
I really don't.

164
00:11:59,391 --> 00:12:01,301
- Yeah, I'm gonna be all right.
- A paintball gun.

165
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:03,480
- This was a good idea though,
Miss Smarty-Pants.
- That's a gateway gun.

166
00:12:03,552 --> 00:12:05,789
How about what's next?
B.B.? Pellet?

167
00:12:05,857 --> 00:12:09,817
Stun? What am I gonna do? What do you
think I should do? I don't know what to do.

168
00:12:09,888 --> 00:12:12,190
Can't you keep him in his room
for the rest of the week?

169
00:12:12,256 --> 00:12:15,736
- But it wasn't even me.    - Okay, you boys
are just lucky that Ricky wasn't badly hurt.

170
00:12:15,808 --> 00:12:18,557
It's okay, Mr. P.
I was a little kid once too.

171
00:12:18,623 --> 00:12:21,470
Oh, that's nice, Ricky.
Thank you. He's a good guy.

172
00:12:21,534 --> 00:12:24,404
He's a good guy.
But, no, I'm not okay with this.

173
00:12:24,479 --> 00:12:27,294
Look, we're up here to fish,
not to hunt your sister's boyfriend, all right?

174
00:12:27,359 --> 00:12:31,734
You could have put his eye out.
Would that have been funny? I don't think so.

175
00:12:33,088 --> 00:12:35,422
All right, let's start over with a clean slate.

176
00:12:35,487 --> 00:12:37,626
Tomorrow, we fish.

177
00:12:37,695 --> 00:12:39,320
- 7:00 a.m. sharp.
- 7:00?

178
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,878
- You're kidding.
- Pass. Nate?

179
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:45,179
Yeah, Stu. Don't you think that's a little early?
How about this?

180
00:12:45,246 --> 00:12:48,180
10:00 a.m., on the boat, no questions asked.

181
00:12:48,253 --> 00:12:51,155
Way to crack the whip, Nate.
Way to crack the whip.

182
00:12:58,716 --> 00:13:01,266
Stu. Stu.

183
00:13:01,342 --> 00:13:04,091
Natey, the TV's gone haywire.

184
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:06,067
Stu, TV's gone haywire!

185
00:13:06,621 --> 00:13:09,818
Mom. Mom, stop it. It's probably the dish.

186
00:13:09,885 --> 00:13:11,794
After the storm,
I'll climb up on the roof and fix it.

187
00:13:11,869 --> 00:13:14,618
Hey, wait a second, Mr. P.
Let me fix the dish, man.

188
00:13:14,684 --> 00:13:16,595
That's the least I can do for your hospitality.

189
00:13:16,669 --> 00:13:19,189
- No, Ricky. You're hurt.
- No. It was just a graze.

190
00:13:19,261 --> 00:13:21,269
Oh, no, honey. He's fine.

191
00:13:21,341 --> 00:13:23,729
Go ahead, Richard. Show some hustle.

192
00:13:23,805 --> 00:13:27,995
Yes, indeedy.
But I will be needing a helping hand.

193
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:32,315
So what do you say, brother?
Give us a chance to bury the old hatchet.

194
00:13:35,004 --> 00:13:38,484
Make things right with Ricky,
or don't come off that roof.

195
00:13:48,507 --> 00:13:49,784
Ladies first.

196
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:58,934
Total creep show.

197
00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:04,851
All right. Here we go.

198
00:14:04,923 --> 00:14:07,378
Listen, about that paintball thing--

199
00:14:07,452 --> 00:14:10,713
Hey. Don't even worry about it.

200
00:14:11,932 --> 00:14:14,069
Firecracker! Too slow.

201
00:14:14,138 --> 00:14:17,848
You know what? Thanks to your little
sharp shooting stunt...

202
00:14:17,915 --> 00:14:19,508
I racked up pity points with your parents...

203
00:14:19,579 --> 00:14:21,848
and big sis is just itching
to be my private nurse.

204
00:14:21,915 --> 00:14:26,258
So thanks a ton, ace.
That was a textbook wingman move.

205
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:28,185
Come on. Quit stalling.

206
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,836
Get your butt up there
and make me Nana's hero.

207
00:14:30,907 --> 00:14:33,394
But you told my dad you'd fix it.

208
00:14:33,467 --> 00:14:35,408
Aw, well, I told your dad a lot of things.

209
00:14:35,482 --> 00:14:38,994
Like my car broke down,
my parents own a lake house...

210
00:14:39,065 --> 00:14:41,106
I'm 18.

211
00:14:42,586 --> 00:14:44,974
You-You're not a senior?

212
00:14:45,049 --> 00:14:46,936
Not in high school.

213
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:49,558
Now go.

214
00:14:52,442 --> 00:14:54,416
Go.

215
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:56,018
There you go.

216
00:15:40,217 --> 00:15:41,709
Hello?

217
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:53,494
Hello?

218
00:15:58,967 --> 00:16:02,419
- Dude, you make it too easy.
- It's not funny.

219
00:16:02,487 --> 00:16:04,854
What the heck happened to the dish?

220
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:06,861
I can't do a week here without TV.

221
00:16:06,935 --> 00:16:08,790
I can't do a week here, period.

222
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,259
Hello, hu-mans.

223
00:16:25,334 --> 00:16:28,749
- Please tell me you see that too.
- Not sure I want to.

224
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:31,058
- But, yeah.
- We come from upstairs!

225
00:16:32,468 --> 00:16:33,905
I handle human contact.

226
00:16:33,974 --> 00:16:37,324
- Yes, sir. Noted. It's understood.
- Hello, humans.

227
00:16:37,398 --> 00:16:41,106
No need to notification army.

228
00:16:41,172 --> 00:16:43,060
- We come in pieces.
- In peace.

229
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:44,500
- What?
- Say it with me. "Peace. "

230
00:16:44,565 --> 00:16:46,671
- What are you talking about?
- Read the book. Peace.

231
00:16:46,742 --> 00:16:49,262
Forget the book!
Attack the humans! Attack!

232
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:52,911
- With pleasure.
- Humans, submit.

233
00:16:54,421 --> 00:16:57,138
- Hey, what is taking you girls so long?
- No, don't. No. No.

234
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,105
Ricky!

235
00:17:02,131 --> 00:17:05,393
- What's happening to him?
- Now the fun begins.

236
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:09,519
- Testing. Testing. Testing.
- Testing. Testing. Testing.

237
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:11,051
Testing.

238
00:17:14,357 --> 00:17:18,218
Humanoid subjects,
we are the Zirkonian species.

239
00:17:18,292 --> 00:17:22,089
And we hereby claim your
luscious planet as our own.

240
00:17:22,164 --> 00:17:27,345
- Wha- Wha...    - You have the
choice of eternal enslavement or...

241
00:17:30,324 --> 00:17:32,211
instantaneous death.

242
00:17:32,276 --> 00:17:34,251
- Run?
- I'm good with run.

243
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:38,413
You have chosen instantaneous death.

244
00:17:38,483 --> 00:17:40,338
The human grubs are escaping.

245
00:17:40,403 --> 00:17:42,737
- It's locked.
- Not from me.

246
00:17:46,484 --> 00:17:48,654
- We're trapped.
- Duck!

247
00:17:55,922 --> 00:17:57,328
Unbelievable.

248
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:02,385
- Razor, go!
- Yes, sir.

249
00:18:06,482 --> 00:18:09,864
- Hey, can I play too?
- Hannah, thank God. Open. Hurry.

250
00:18:11,538 --> 00:18:13,131
Hurry.

251
00:18:14,674 --> 00:18:16,263
Creepy-crawly!

252
00:18:16,337 --> 00:18:18,989
No, no, no. Come back. Come back!

253
00:18:19,058 --> 00:18:20,946
- Take them down!
- Look out!

254
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:23,181
Hey, frog-face!

255
00:18:25,841 --> 00:18:28,013
What's with all the noise?

256
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,895
- Open the window!
- Open it.

257
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,816
- You open it.
- No, you open it.

258
00:18:32,881 --> 00:18:34,768
- Hurry! Get them!
- Help!

259
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:36,971
Someone, open it!

260
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,081
Come on. Right there.

261
00:18:39,152 --> 00:18:41,225
- Charge!
- Hurry up!

262
00:18:42,257 --> 00:18:44,200
Move, twin!

263
00:18:46,672 --> 00:18:49,006
Everybody, downstairs now!

264
00:18:49,072 --> 00:18:50,502
- Why?
-Just move!

265
00:18:56,973 --> 00:18:59,529
Creepy-crawlies.

266
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,869
- Creepy.
- Go, go, go!

267
00:19:01,936 --> 00:19:03,824
Get down! Down!

268
00:19:08,048 --> 00:19:11,494
- Pull! Pull! Pull!
- I am! Hurry!

269
00:19:15,951 --> 00:19:18,221
- Stupid remote control.
- Glorious commander, be careful.

270
00:19:18,288 --> 00:19:20,459
- What's wrong with it? Fix it.
- Be careful!

271
00:19:21,678 --> 00:19:23,657
You a zombie?

272
00:19:23,727 --> 00:19:27,208
- No. You?
- No.

273
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,841
Prove it.

274
00:19:28,911 --> 00:19:31,366
- What do you mean?
- I mean prove it!

275
00:19:31,439 --> 00:19:34,340
You-You wet the bed until you were 10.
A zombie wouldn't know that.

276
00:19:34,414 --> 00:19:36,454
- Here they come!  - Look out!
- Ugly humans, submit.

277
00:19:36,527 --> 00:19:38,253
Get the rope.

278
00:19:40,239 --> 00:19:42,758
- Tie it off!
- I'm trying. Push harder.

279
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,805
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

280
00:19:44,878 --> 00:19:47,496
She scratched me with her claws!

281
00:19:47,566 --> 00:19:49,092
Sorry, sucker.

282
00:19:49,934 --> 00:19:51,535
He cut off her nails.

283
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:53,452
We gotta call 911.

284
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:02,819
- I can't get a signal.
- Neither can I.

285
00:20:02,894 --> 00:20:06,439
Mine's dead too.

286
00:20:06,509 --> 00:20:08,930
- Those midget Martians must be jamming us.
- Never a good sign.

287
00:20:10,253 --> 00:20:11,787
It's working!

288
00:20:13,325 --> 00:20:15,878
There's no buttons. What is this thing?

289
00:20:15,949 --> 00:20:19,462
It's a rotary phone. You spin it.

290
00:20:26,509 --> 00:20:29,443
What happened up there?
Was "get them" not clear enough?

291
00:20:29,517 --> 00:20:32,200
Someone was obviously distracted.

292
00:20:32,268 --> 00:20:34,439
I was following the plan.

293
00:20:34,508 --> 00:20:36,418
You were playing with your little toy.

294
00:20:36,493 --> 00:20:39,657
- This is a deadly weapon! It is.
- No. These are deadly weapons.

295
00:20:39,725 --> 00:20:43,783
Listen on yourselves. This is why
we lost success on our mission previous.

296
00:20:43,852 --> 00:20:46,536
Not looking to blame throw,
but that one was Razor's fault.

297
00:20:46,605 --> 00:20:51,012
- What? You were the one...  - If we lose
success this time, I lose my command.

298
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,993
Now, you're going to learn to work together...

299
00:20:53,068 --> 00:20:56,166
or we will together end up shoveling manure
back in Sector 7.

300
00:20:56,235 --> 00:20:58,144
We won't let you down, sir.

301
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:00,554
Let's go enslave some humans!

302
00:21:00,619 --> 00:21:04,809
Actually, about that,
I'm sure enslaving is plenty of fun.

303
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:06,785
- But why the hu-mans?
- What?

304
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,899
- They don't seem that bad.
- Aw. Rookie.

305
00:21:08,972 --> 00:21:11,109
"They don't seem that bad."

306
00:21:11,179 --> 00:21:14,561
- Funny. That's what our engineer previous said.
- Engineer previous?

307
00:21:14,635 --> 00:21:18,083
Right before the creature
that was "not that bad" ate him!

308
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:20,521
The humans are vicious.

309
00:21:20,586 --> 00:21:24,002
Peace is not an option.

310
00:21:28,554 --> 00:21:29,957
Sheriff here.

311
00:21:30,026 --> 00:21:32,328
Th-there's an alien invasion
at our rental house.

312
00:21:32,394 --> 00:21:35,809
- Knee-high beings. Very violent.
- Knee-high. Like a hobbit?

313
00:21:35,882 --> 00:21:37,890
No. Real. Look, I know this sounds crazy...

314
00:21:37,962 --> 00:21:40,776
- but you gotta understand--
- Okay, yeah, listen, son.

315
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:44,736
You do know making a fraudulent complaint
is a federal offense. It's punishable--

316
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:46,666
Hello?

317
00:21:48,842 --> 00:21:51,809
Decent technique... for a female.

318
00:21:53,226 --> 00:21:54,404
How's that technique?

319
00:21:54,473 --> 00:21:55,624
Hello?

320
00:21:56,874 --> 00:21:58,824
We gotta tell our parents.

321
00:22:23,305 --> 00:22:25,694
Think he's still an alien zombie?

322
00:22:31,335 --> 00:22:32,711
You are useless.

323
00:22:32,873 --> 00:22:36,581
Why aren't the mind-control plugs working?
You're the engineer.

324
00:22:36,649 --> 00:22:38,753
Figure it out. Hurry up. Hurry up.

325
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:40,734
Hurry up. Hurry up. Fix it!

326
00:22:40,808 --> 00:22:43,174
- Fix it. Fix it now, you idiot.
- He's not talking to us, right?

327
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:47,232
I think he's picking up their conversation.
They had, like, a Bluetooth.

328
00:22:47,303 --> 00:22:49,343
What do you mean their hormone levels
are too unstable?

329
00:22:49,415 --> 00:22:51,325
Are you telling me the plugs only work
on mature subjects?

330
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,604
Why did we not plan for this?

331
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:55,679
You have failed me, you incompetent piece of--

332
00:22:55,751 --> 00:22:58,207
- Deck.
- Translation not available.

333
00:22:58,279 --> 00:23:02,076
These humans will pay!

334
00:23:05,988 --> 00:23:07,009
Did you hear that?

335
00:23:07,078 --> 00:23:08,828
Yeah. Sounds like Ricky landed on his face.

336
00:23:08,903 --> 00:23:12,481
No. Those things they shot at us,
they-re-they're mind-control plugs.

337
00:23:12,551 --> 00:23:16,030
They won't work on kids.
It's like you said. We're wired differently.

338
00:23:16,102 --> 00:23:18,436
Wha-What about Ricky?
It tagged him and he's Bethany's age.

339
00:23:18,502 --> 00:23:20,772
No. He lied. The tool's in college.

340
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:22,694
So if their plugs don't work on kids--

341
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:24,612
- That means we're safe.
- It means we can fight 'em.

342
00:23:24,677 --> 00:23:27,939
It means they'll go after our parents.
They're walking targets.

343
00:23:28,005 --> 00:23:29,756
We got to tell 'em. Now.

344
00:23:30,213 --> 00:23:31,811
Wait. Think.

345
00:23:32,358 --> 00:23:35,772
If our parents even go near those things,
they'll get zapped and end up zombies.

346
00:23:35,845 --> 00:23:37,250
Our own parents will attack us.

347
00:23:37,318 --> 00:23:38,398
We need the police

348
00:23:38,565 --> 00:23:41,698
- and their hard-core firepower.
- Armed zombies. Even better.

349
00:23:41,766 --> 00:23:46,338
- We're done. Game over.  - Game over for
the grown-ups. But we can still fight back.

350
00:23:46,406 --> 00:23:49,057
So you expect us to stop
an alien invasion on our own?

351
00:23:49,126 --> 00:23:51,995
He's right. We're the only option.

352
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:54,010
But we can't tell anyone.

353
00:23:54,084 --> 00:23:56,670
No police, no parents, no exceptions.

354
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,846
- Got it?
- Hannah?

355
00:24:00,549 --> 00:24:03,395
They're up in the attic right now, little aliens.

356
00:24:03,459 --> 00:24:08,447
They're loud and scary and really mean.

357
00:24:08,517 --> 00:24:12,640
- Han, there's no such things as aliens.
- Yes, there is. I saw them.

358
00:24:12,708 --> 00:24:16,090
They smashed the skylight
and tried to break the attic stairs.

359
00:24:16,164 --> 00:24:19,874
Well, let's hope not for your sake.
We put a huge deposit on this place.

360
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:22,111
So you boys better keep it in one piece.

361
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:24,416
- You heard her, Tom. No more trouble.
- It was just a video game.

362
00:24:24,483 --> 00:24:27,931
- We shouldn't have let her watch. It's rated
"T" for "Teen".   - It's teen violence.

363
00:24:28,003 --> 00:24:31,682
Tommy, I'm scared.
I don't like the mean aliens.

364
00:24:31,749 --> 00:24:36,571
Don't worry, Han. Just pretend it's a big game,
a game that we're gonna win.

365
00:24:36,644 --> 00:24:40,092
-Just think about how little they are.
- Little and deadly.

366
00:24:40,164 --> 00:24:42,880
- What do we do now?
- We figure out their weakness.

367
00:24:42,947 --> 00:24:45,947
They flew here from another galaxy.
You really think they have a weakness?

368
00:24:46,018 --> 00:24:49,019
First rule of the warrior code--

369
00:24:49,091 --> 00:24:51,000
All enemies have a weakness.

370
00:24:51,075 --> 00:24:54,588
Sparks, why isn't my locator map
up and running?

371
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:57,529
I told you. I need parts to repair it.
You're not helping--

372
00:25:03,042 --> 00:25:05,858
Even on Earth, the male is dominant.

373
00:25:08,482 --> 00:25:11,350
- Wait.
- But the female always wins.

374
00:25:11,425 --> 00:25:13,465
What the--

375
00:25:13,537 --> 00:25:16,768
By the rings of Zirkon.

376
00:25:17,793 --> 00:25:18,973
That makes no sense.

377
00:25:19,042 --> 00:25:22,357
They were fighting.
Now their lips are hugging?

378
00:25:22,434 --> 00:25:24,288
- I would never.
- Never.

379
00:25:24,353 --> 00:25:26,557
- Ne-ver.
- I'm sorry.

380
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:28,959
Can I get you anything?
A cold drink? Some snacks?

381
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:32,344
Or would you rather help me
invade a planet?

382
00:25:34,816 --> 00:25:38,233
All right,
recon's my specialty. I'm going up.

383
00:25:45,025 --> 00:25:48,822
- I'm coming with you.
- Tom, be careful.

384
00:25:52,448 --> 00:25:55,350
Enemy... apprehended.

385
00:25:57,165 --> 00:25:58,606
I'll interrogate.

386
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:07,930
- Disgusting.
- What? Seriously, what?

387
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,854
Locator activated, sir.

388
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,221
Excellent. Target the objective.

389
00:26:12,288 --> 00:26:14,971
Zoom in. Zoom.

390
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,900
Zoom. Zoom, zoom, zoom.

391
00:26:18,975 --> 00:26:23,863
- You don't have to keep saying "zoom".
- Zoom. Zoom.

392
00:26:23,935 --> 00:26:25,791
And... rotate.

393
00:26:25,856 --> 00:26:28,244
I think they're after
something in the house.

394
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:30,424
- Let me get a better look.
- Stop.

395
00:26:32,797 --> 00:26:33,761
Rotate.

396
00:26:34,523 --> 00:26:35,516
The basement.

397
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,179
Tom, help me!

398
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:42,916
That must have hurt.

399
00:26:44,607 --> 00:26:47,159
Basement. We gotta get to the basement.

400
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:49,053
Ricky?

401
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:50,974
Ricky!

402
00:26:51,614 --> 00:26:54,388
Hey, guys, wait.
Have you guys seen Ricky?

403
00:26:54,942 --> 00:26:57,593
Pretty sure he's still
hanging around here somewhere.

404
00:26:57,662 --> 00:26:59,230
- Actually, Beth--
- He didn't leave, did he?

405
00:26:59,295 --> 00:27:00,856
No, no. He--

406
00:27:01,212 --> 00:27:03,061
He told us he was heading
back to the lake...

407
00:27:03,134 --> 00:27:05,916
to, bronze up his rock-hard abs.

408
00:27:05,982 --> 00:27:08,086
- Yeah, he wants you to meet him there.
- Wait.

409
00:27:08,157 --> 00:27:10,678
What did you guys talk about on the roof?

410
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:12,604
Did he say anything about me?

411
00:27:12,669 --> 00:27:15,540
No. No, no. He-- He talked about his car.

412
00:27:15,614 --> 00:27:19,481
And--
But pre-pretty much just his car.

413
00:27:19,741 --> 00:27:21,561
But you should hit the lake so
he doesn't think you're blowing him off.

414
00:27:21,629 --> 00:27:24,498
- Yeah, the lake.
- Over there. It's probably good there.

415
00:27:28,444 --> 00:27:31,859
- I'm telling you, their map led down here.
- You positive?

416
00:27:32,508 --> 00:27:35,315
You hear that? Rice Krispies.

417
00:27:49,531 --> 00:27:50,647
What is that?

418
00:27:54,555 --> 00:27:56,562
It's them.

419
00:27:59,293 --> 00:28:01,202
Something down here's setting it off.

420
00:28:12,091 --> 00:28:15,439
Well, whatever it is,
we can't let 'em get to it.

421
00:28:15,515 --> 00:28:17,904
Everyone, gear up. We move on my command.

422
00:28:17,979 --> 00:28:19,986
Now, just hold on.

423
00:28:20,059 --> 00:28:23,921
If we run up there with a bunch
of random junk, we're gonna get creamed.

424
00:28:23,995 --> 00:28:26,231
We can make something better.

425
00:28:26,299 --> 00:28:28,403
We're in the middle of a battle,
and you wanna play science fair?

426
00:28:28,474 --> 00:28:31,508
No way. We're going back in now...

427
00:28:31,579 --> 00:28:33,913
before our parents end up as alien zombies.

428
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:36,247
You're not thinking. We need a plan.

429
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:39,031
- I already have a great idea for a weapon.
- Really?

430
00:28:39,386 --> 00:28:41,367
Let's go.

431
00:28:41,914 --> 00:28:42,960
Now.

432
00:28:50,075 --> 00:28:51,667
Hannah, hand me that tape.

433
00:28:52,698 --> 00:28:54,169
- What's up, Nate?
- Hey, guys! - Hey, Nana!

434
00:28:54,234 --> 00:28:56,473
Who wants a treat?

435
00:28:57,305 --> 00:29:00,857
That's a lot of tools to try to fix the TV.

436
00:29:13,849 --> 00:29:16,565
They're busting through.
The warrior code says strike first.

437
00:29:16,633 --> 00:29:19,764
- Art, cover me.
- With the rake?

438
00:29:28,888 --> 00:29:32,335
How do you feel now? Suckers!

439
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:35,312
Mission accomplished.

440
00:29:40,056 --> 00:29:41,298
Oh, God.

441
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,922
- Oh--
- Crud.

442
00:29:47,542 --> 00:29:48,695
It's a dud.

443
00:29:51,702 --> 00:29:52,668
What the--

444
00:29:54,072 --> 00:29:55,761
- What's happening?
- Why are we floating?

445
00:29:55,832 --> 00:29:58,832
They turned off the gravity,
like in Halo.

446
00:29:58,903 --> 00:30:02,831
This isn't Xbox, Lee.
It's real. Like Wii.

447
00:30:02,903 --> 00:30:06,645
- Now what are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

448
00:30:06,711 --> 00:30:09,613
Stay behind me.

449
00:30:09,687 --> 00:30:12,948
- No! Don't! Don't!
- There's no gravity.

450
00:30:17,143 --> 00:30:19,505
Hello, hu-mans.

451
00:30:19,766 --> 00:30:22,352
Enjoying the ride?

452
00:30:25,303 --> 00:30:27,157
They have gravity boots.

453
00:30:27,222 --> 00:30:29,742
- Why don't we have gravity boots?
- "They have gravity boots."

454
00:30:29,814 --> 00:30:32,978
The door! Stop 'em! Use your weapon, Tom!

455
00:30:33,047 --> 00:30:35,151
- Bring it, meat sack.
- Today!

456
00:30:37,141 --> 00:30:40,654
A potato gun? That's your big idea?

457
00:30:40,726 --> 00:30:44,404
- My plan is working.
- My plan. You mean my plan.

458
00:30:46,326 --> 00:30:48,181
Hurry, Tommy!

459
00:31:07,061 --> 00:31:09,450
- You okay?
- I'm fine. The door.

460
00:31:09,525 --> 00:31:10,488
On it.

461
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:13,869
Jake, get the grenade!

462
00:31:17,619 --> 00:31:18,801
Hurry!

463
00:31:22,388 --> 00:31:24,777
Quick! Toss it here!

464
00:31:27,892 --> 00:31:28,856
What?

465
00:31:33,714 --> 00:31:34,892
Sock Monkey.

466
00:31:37,426 --> 00:31:39,369
You little--

467
00:31:39,443 --> 00:31:41,036
Quick! Get 'em!

468
00:31:41,491 --> 00:31:42,472
Go!

469
00:31:42,644 --> 00:31:44,593
- Shoot him! Shoot him!
- Go, go, go!

470
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:45,973
Shoot him!

471
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,589
- Come on!
- Again.

472
00:31:48,658 --> 00:31:50,185
Buttocks on fire!

473
00:31:52,788 --> 00:31:55,369
That's the thing they used to control Ricky.

474
00:31:58,386 --> 00:32:01,615
Cool. Let me see it.
Nice action on the toggles.

475
00:32:03,442 --> 00:32:06,409
Wait. What are these?
Give it back. Let me see.

476
00:32:06,482 --> 00:32:09,580
- I picked it up first.
- Give it back.

477
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:11,952
- It's mine.
- Hey, hey, hey, guys. This is not a toy. It's real.

478
00:32:18,705 --> 00:32:20,778
- Ricky?
- Yep.

479
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:22,858
Get him before somebody finds him.
I'll stand alien watch.

480
00:32:33,873 --> 00:32:35,914
I'm sure that'll buff right out.

481
00:32:36,466 --> 00:32:38,670
Wonder where he went.

482
00:32:38,738 --> 00:32:40,687
I'll find him.

483
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:54,331
Cool. So these move him.
And these...

484
00:32:55,308 --> 00:32:56,806
operate the arms.

485
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:02,992
Talk about the ultimate Game Boy.

486
00:33:06,896 --> 00:33:10,377
- [Laughing]
- What does that big button do?

487
00:33:17,102 --> 00:33:18,288
What the--

488
00:33:18,639 --> 00:33:20,846
My car!

489
00:33:21,488 --> 00:33:24,717
That would be the on-and-off button.

490
00:33:25,167 --> 00:33:26,479
Press it again.

491
00:33:27,215 --> 00:33:28,972
Car!

492
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:33,446
- Who did this to my car?
- You did, you giant idiot.

493
00:33:33,998 --> 00:33:35,046
Ricky!

494
00:33:37,422 --> 00:33:38,730
Where have you been?

495
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:42,150
Shut up, you little b-- Bethany.

496
00:33:42,223 --> 00:33:43,466
What?

497
00:33:44,494 --> 00:33:47,627
- Why are you hitting me?
- Why are you being such a jerk?

498
00:33:48,462 --> 00:33:50,030
Revenge is so sweet.

499
00:33:50,095 --> 00:33:52,712
I just spent the last hour
walking around the lake. Where were you?

500
00:33:52,782 --> 00:33:56,077
- I--
- That's what I thought.

501
00:33:56,143 --> 00:33:58,061
No. I-I don't know.

502
00:33:58,511 --> 00:34:00,420
- Want me to bring him back?
- Babe, please don't be mad at me.

503
00:34:00,495 --> 00:34:02,860
- Did your brain fall out of your head?
- Let him suffer.

504
00:34:13,005 --> 00:34:16,267
Where's Ricky?
Taken prisoner by the aliens?

505
00:34:16,333 --> 00:34:19,629
No. Worse. My sister.

506
00:34:20,877 --> 00:34:23,015
Any action up here?

507
00:34:23,085 --> 00:34:26,381
It's been quiet. Too quiet.

508
00:34:28,364 --> 00:34:30,155
No talking in here. Got it?

509
00:34:32,844 --> 00:34:34,950
What are they doing in the vents?

510
00:34:35,021 --> 00:34:38,850
- Their map.
That's how they'll get to the basement.
- What do we do?

511
00:34:44,812 --> 00:34:46,722
I hope this works, Einstein.

512
00:34:46,796 --> 00:34:50,625
I didn't get to thank you
for pulling me to safety back there...

513
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:52,587
because I didn't need you to.

514
00:34:53,035 --> 00:34:54,954
- That doesn't make sense.
- I don't like you.

515
00:34:55,308 --> 00:34:56,930
- Stop talking.
- Good to know. Okay.

516
00:35:02,348 --> 00:35:03,335
Sweating?

517
00:35:06,764 --> 00:35:07,972
Hot!

518
00:35:08,332 --> 00:35:10,982
Hot! Hot! Hotter! Run!

519
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,315
Fall back! Fall back!

520
00:35:17,835 --> 00:35:19,234
Sounds like they're mad.

521
00:35:19,883 --> 00:35:22,338
Nice job. I think it's working.

522
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:24,386
Kids, get down here right now!

523
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:29,281
Who turned on the heat?

524
00:35:29,354 --> 00:35:31,362
I did. We need that on.

525
00:35:31,435 --> 00:35:33,257
Are you crazy? It's July.

526
00:35:33,322 --> 00:35:36,224
- Yeah, but it's-- it's freezing in here.
- Yeah. Arctic.

527
00:35:36,299 --> 00:35:38,534
Yeah. I think Hannah's
coming down with something.

528
00:35:40,843 --> 00:35:42,731
What's going on?

529
00:35:42,795 --> 00:35:46,406
We're fighting aliens.
I'm pretending it's pretend.

530
00:35:46,475 --> 00:35:48,711
I mean, it is pretend.

531
00:35:48,778 --> 00:35:52,804
Okay, but I'm not pretending,
so don't touch the thermostat.

532
00:35:52,874 --> 00:35:55,743
- Tom, I'm not playing around.
- Neither am I.

533
00:35:55,818 --> 00:35:58,817
Tom, I'm not kidding. You wanna spend
the rest of the week in your room?

534
00:35:58,889 --> 00:36:00,896
Why can't you at least trust
there's a reason I'm doing this?

535
00:36:00,969 --> 00:36:03,358
A reason why you're blasting the furnace
on summer vacation?

536
00:36:03,433 --> 00:36:05,190
- Yes. - A reason why you
shot your sister's boyfriend?

537
00:36:05,258 --> 00:36:07,974
- Yes. - A reason why you're
talking back, giving me attitude?

538
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:11,838
- Failing your classes?
- So that's what this is about?

539
00:36:13,449 --> 00:36:15,653
I failed them on purpose.

540
00:36:15,721 --> 00:36:17,663
Yeah, I tanked my grades, okay?

541
00:36:17,736 --> 00:36:19,678
I'm tired of getting picked on
because I'm a brainiac.

542
00:36:19,752 --> 00:36:21,607
I was a brainiac. It worked for me.

543
00:36:21,673 --> 00:36:25,055
I don't wanna be like you. I wanna be cool.

544
00:36:30,312 --> 00:36:32,996
Don't touch the thermostat.

545
00:36:36,168 --> 00:36:39,812
Is that true?
You really fail on purpose?

546
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,335
Nobody likes a mathlete.

547
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:44,775
Man, we can't fight these things
with our parents around.

548
00:36:44,841 --> 00:36:47,109
We can't just get rid of 'em.

549
00:36:47,176 --> 00:36:50,973
Maybe we can. Here's what I want you to do.

550
00:36:56,424 --> 00:36:58,628
Send it.

551
00:37:00,104 --> 00:37:03,813
- I hate it when we fight.
- Aw, I can't fight someone as cute as you.

552
00:37:03,879 --> 00:37:05,701
Well, I'm glad we made up.

553
00:37:05,767 --> 00:37:08,485
Well, it's not an official make-up
without the make-up kiss.

554
00:37:08,552 --> 00:37:11,934
- Easy. My family's up there.
- And your family's crazy about me.

555
00:37:12,007 --> 00:37:14,528
- What about you?
- Well, you know I like you.

556
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,868
And we have the whole summer
ahead of us.

557
00:37:16,935 --> 00:37:19,456
Maybe we don't have to go so fast.

558
00:37:19,527 --> 00:37:21,567
What? What?

559
00:37:28,134 --> 00:37:29,990
Is that a "no"?

560
00:37:30,055 --> 00:37:31,483
Ricky!

561
00:37:33,414 --> 00:37:35,551
Ricky!

562
00:37:37,285 --> 00:37:39,742
- Careful. Don't break him.
- Ricky!

563
00:37:39,815 --> 00:37:42,236
- Better grab his shirt.
- Ricky!

564
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:46,619
Still no sign of 'em.

565
00:37:50,054 --> 00:37:53,218
- Where are they?
- 2 options.

566
00:37:53,286 --> 00:37:56,765
We're dealing with a retreat
or a surprise attack.

567
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,334
Surprise attack.

568
00:38:12,229 --> 00:38:15,043
Hey, where's Tom?
I thought he was gonna help you.

569
00:38:15,108 --> 00:38:17,726
- So did I.
- Bad news.

570
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:20,000
The leasing office called.

571
00:38:20,068 --> 00:38:23,002
They need you to go back there
before they close for the holidays.

572
00:38:23,076 --> 00:38:25,924
- Really?
- Problem with the contract.

573
00:38:25,989 --> 00:38:28,225
They insisted.

574
00:38:28,293 --> 00:38:30,463
Ricky, are you okay?

575
00:38:33,091 --> 00:38:35,579
-Just allergies, Mr. P.
-Just allergies, Mr. P.

576
00:38:35,652 --> 00:38:38,205
But they did say it's urgent.

577
00:38:38,276 --> 00:38:41,571
- Urgent?
- Okay, I'll call and I'll sort this out.

578
00:38:41,636 --> 00:38:44,318
That's so weird.

579
00:38:46,851 --> 00:38:50,944
Oh, this is weird, Stu.
I think the phone's dead.

580
00:38:53,475 --> 00:38:55,483
Did they just cut off our power?

581
00:38:56,131 --> 00:38:57,857
They are gonna hear about it from me.

582
00:38:57,923 --> 00:39:00,771
Let's go.
We are going down there right now.

583
00:39:00,835 --> 00:39:03,201
Hey, guys, we can use
some more beer, some chips.

584
00:39:03,266 --> 00:39:05,819
Why don't you run to the grocery store?
I'll fire up the grill.

585
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:08,760
- And watch the kids?
- Okay, whatever.

586
00:39:08,834 --> 00:39:11,038
- No.
- No.

587
00:39:11,106 --> 00:39:14,238
I mean, you all have to go.

588
00:39:14,307 --> 00:39:17,373
They said all your names
are on the lease.

589
00:39:18,883 --> 00:39:21,086
- I'll look after the kids.
- I don't know if that's a good idea.

590
00:39:21,154 --> 00:39:23,674
- No. That'd be--
- Well, I-- I guess I could drive.

591
00:39:24,897 --> 00:39:25,688
Okay.

592
00:39:25,762 --> 00:39:28,283
- Okay.
- And, Mr. P...

593
00:39:28,355 --> 00:39:31,201
while you're out,
can you get me some adult diapers?

594
00:39:31,265 --> 00:39:33,687
- Mine are almost full.
- Mine are almost full.

595
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:37,666
That is a bad allergy.

596
00:39:38,403 --> 00:39:40,376
Super absorbent.

597
00:39:42,721 --> 00:39:46,551
Look. Alien death mist.
Don't breathe.

598
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:48,285
Put him on "pause".

599
00:39:53,056 --> 00:39:55,871
Happy 4th of July, space maggots.

600
00:39:55,937 --> 00:39:57,826
Jake, there's smoke in the vents.

601
00:39:57,890 --> 00:40:00,736
It's me. We have unfriendlies on the move.
I tracked them down and held 'em off.

602
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,142
- Nice.
- Parents?

603
00:40:02,209 --> 00:40:04,215
- Gone.
- Nice.

604
00:40:04,288 --> 00:40:06,198
Now we can take it up a notch.

605
00:40:11,968 --> 00:40:14,783
This could get ugly. Hannah, go hide.

606
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:18,392
- Yeah. Seek safety.
- Not you.

607
00:40:21,568 --> 00:40:23,423
Incoming! Duck!

608
00:40:25,408 --> 00:40:27,295
Sayonara, suckers!

609
00:40:29,247 --> 00:40:30,488
Crud.

610
00:40:34,495 --> 00:40:37,658
- My arm! My head!
- They got me!

611
00:40:39,229 --> 00:40:41,751
Go, go, go!

612
00:40:42,781 --> 00:40:46,013
I'm starting to see why the last engineer--

613
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:12,147
I see you've booby-trapped your room.

614
00:41:12,222 --> 00:41:14,459
Got it. Got it. Don't got it!

615
00:41:15,646 --> 00:41:19,191
Ingenious human snare.

616
00:41:31,388 --> 00:41:33,469
I thought I was clumsy.

617
00:41:36,765 --> 00:41:39,350
- It's okay. Don't worry.
- I come in peace.

618
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:42,104
It's okay. I'll help you.

619
00:41:44,924 --> 00:41:47,095
Don't worry. Trust me. It's okay.

620
00:41:51,548 --> 00:41:53,588
You've got a boo-boo. Don't move.

621
00:42:01,885 --> 00:42:04,373
- Okay?
- Thank you.

622
00:42:05,915 --> 00:42:08,250
Tazer. Razor.

623
00:42:08,315 --> 00:42:11,064
Sparks. Sparks!

624
00:42:12,091 --> 00:42:13,912
He's critical to mission.

625
00:42:17,564 --> 00:42:20,018
- Nice sounds.
- It's music.

626
00:42:21,588 --> 00:42:23,638
Music. I try?

627
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:26,042
Sure.

628
00:42:44,123 --> 00:42:45,716
Yeah!

629
00:42:50,362 --> 00:42:54,835
We've definitely slowed 'em down,
but those buggers adapt fast.

630
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:57,589
We need to pull out the big guns.

631
00:42:59,482 --> 00:43:01,969
Black Cat Whistler or Fire Dragon?

632
00:43:03,322 --> 00:43:06,072
How about not burning down the house?

633
00:43:13,785 --> 00:43:15,760
He's armed! Enemy armed!

634
00:43:15,833 --> 00:43:18,321
Hannah, step away from the alien.

635
00:43:20,473 --> 00:43:23,636
No! Leave him alone! He's my friend.

636
00:43:23,704 --> 00:43:25,876
He was just holding a ray gun to your head.

637
00:43:25,946 --> 00:43:28,215
It's my bubble blower. He fixed it for me.

638
00:43:28,282 --> 00:43:31,826
He's not like the others. Look.

639
00:43:32,952 --> 00:43:35,603
First sign of aggression, I'm taking him out...

640
00:43:35,672 --> 00:43:37,199
with extreme prejudice.

641
00:43:37,273 --> 00:43:39,956
I don't have training for this.
No training.

642
00:43:40,025 --> 00:43:43,023
- It's okay, Mr. Snuggle Lump.
- Snuggle Lump?

643
00:43:43,096 --> 00:43:45,911
- Yeah, that's what I named him.
- My name Sparks.

644
00:43:45,976 --> 00:43:48,399
He's not your pet, Hannah.
He's a freakin' alien.

645
00:43:49,433 --> 00:43:51,798
He's my alien.

646
00:43:52,056 --> 00:43:53,174
Hi.

647
00:43:57,688 --> 00:43:58,897
I mean--

648
00:43:59,544 --> 00:44:01,070
Maybe she's right.

649
00:44:01,143 --> 00:44:04,754
I mean, look at his belt.
I think those are tools.

650
00:44:04,823 --> 00:44:09,330
Hey, it's okay, buddy.
We just want to talk to you.

651
00:44:09,399 --> 00:44:11,788
Come on, Snugs.

652
00:44:11,862 --> 00:44:12,916
Back up.

653
00:44:30,293 --> 00:44:31,285
Watch.

654
00:44:39,318 --> 00:44:41,740
- Awesome.
- How does he do that?

655
00:45:00,534 --> 00:45:02,192
What the heck was that?

656
00:45:02,262 --> 00:45:04,881
Talking about feelings comes with the
territory when you have a girl friend.

657
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:08,047
There is no loop hole for that one!

658
00:45:08,117 --> 00:45:10,027
Okay. Okay, I get it.

659
00:45:10,101 --> 00:45:14,193
You're not gonna talk when I'm yelling.
I'm sorry. It's not mature of me to shout.

660
00:45:15,925 --> 00:45:21,193
Look, I am so, so happy
being your girlfriend.

661
00:45:21,268 --> 00:45:24,782
But if you really care about me
the way that I care about you...

662
00:45:24,854 --> 00:45:27,787
then it shouldn't be a problem
to give me the time that I need.

663
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:31,628
Maybe you need to think about it.

664
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:36,435
And I can respect that. Okay?
Take all the time that you want.

665
00:45:36,883 --> 00:45:39,794
I'll be here, ready to talk.

666
00:45:43,291 --> 00:45:45,147
With you.

667
00:45:50,364 --> 00:45:52,218
So-So that's how it is?

668
00:45:52,283 --> 00:45:56,178
I'm getting the silent treatment?
Who is in high school now?

669
00:46:01,242 --> 00:46:03,058
Why are you trying to kill us?

670
00:46:03,132 --> 00:46:05,466
- What's the invasion plan?
- What's your weakness?

671
00:46:05,531 --> 00:46:06,839
- Water?
- Earth germs?

672
00:46:06,906 --> 00:46:08,696
- Women?
- Are there more of you coming?

673
00:46:08,763 --> 00:46:10,452
- We need the information.
- I--

674
00:46:10,524 --> 00:46:12,729
Guys, don't be mean.

675
00:46:12,795 --> 00:46:14,617
Han, we have to interrogate him.

676
00:46:14,684 --> 00:46:16,984
Do you want the world to end? Do ya?

677
00:46:18,106 --> 00:46:19,862
No.

678
00:46:26,874 --> 00:46:29,143
House here. Mission objective here.

679
00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:33,172
What you're after isn't in the basement.
It's under the basement.

680
00:46:33,243 --> 00:46:35,381
- Yes.   - What are you trying
to steal from our planet?

681
00:46:35,450 --> 00:46:38,483
Who says it's from our planet?
Look at that thing. It looks alien to me.

682
00:46:38,554 --> 00:46:40,595
It must be from their planet.

683
00:46:41,338 --> 00:46:43,536
Yeah. Planet Fruitcake.

684
00:46:44,568 --> 00:46:46,456
Whatever it is, it's huge.

685
00:46:53,177 --> 00:46:55,086
Almost done.

686
00:46:57,113 --> 00:46:58,931
So, that's what's in the capsule?

687
00:46:59,290 --> 00:47:02,323
Some kind of... giant machine?

688
00:47:02,394 --> 00:47:04,781
Great. A giant alien death machine.

689
00:47:04,857 --> 00:47:07,923
- No one said anything about death.
- I doubt it's a photocopier.

690
00:47:07,993 --> 00:47:11,288
Come on! We can't trust this 4-armed freak.
He's one of them.

691
00:47:11,352 --> 00:47:13,555
He's not.

692
00:47:14,648 --> 00:47:17,517
This guy doesn't fit in with the others.

693
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:24,215
He's... different.

694
00:47:24,665 --> 00:47:27,121
Great. A geek alien.

695
00:47:27,288 --> 00:47:29,807
Jake, he's not a geek.

696
00:47:29,881 --> 00:47:32,247
It's better than a killer alien.

697
00:47:54,999 --> 00:47:58,261
Buenas noches, wrinkles.

698
00:48:03,894 --> 00:48:05,615
Oh, this is ridiculous.

699
00:48:10,934 --> 00:48:12,500
Well, this sucks.

700
00:48:18,102 --> 00:48:19,218
Modified.

701
00:48:22,326 --> 00:48:23,700
Sweet.

702
00:48:25,365 --> 00:48:26,738
Sweet.

703
00:48:29,559 --> 00:48:30,519
Sorry.

704
00:48:34,358 --> 00:48:36,976
- It's the po-po. Be cool.
- Be cool?

705
00:48:37,046 --> 00:48:38,322
Open up!

706
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:40,844
Oh, crap. We forgot about Nana.

707
00:48:40,917 --> 00:48:43,600
- Open the door!    - Hold on.
Hannah, quick. Hide your alien.

708
00:48:43,668 --> 00:48:45,676
- Open the door now!
- Snugs.

709
00:48:45,749 --> 00:48:48,018
Get in!

710
00:48:48,085 --> 00:48:49,874
Hold on a second.

711
00:48:49,941 --> 00:48:53,487
Children of my children, I request entry.

712
00:48:53,558 --> 00:48:55,979
I have candied sweets.

713
00:48:56,053 --> 00:48:58,508
Don't open it. That's not Nana.

714
00:48:58,582 --> 00:49:01,100
Are you sure?

715
00:49:05,810 --> 00:49:07,154
Yeah, I'm sure.

716
00:49:08,563 --> 00:49:11,727
Surrender Engineer Sparks now.

717
00:49:11,796 --> 00:49:14,317
- Nana-- Nana--
- Out of my way, Earth children!

718
00:49:14,389 --> 00:49:16,428
- Move!
- Nana, don't make me hurt you.

719
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:18,256
Nana, Nana--

720
00:49:25,204 --> 00:49:27,211
Return him to me.

721
00:49:27,284 --> 00:49:30,578
Tom, do something!

722
00:49:38,228 --> 00:49:39,438
Gross human.

723
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:44,681
Someone's gotta get the door.

724
00:49:44,755 --> 00:49:47,918
- We can't let the cops in here.
It's too dangerous.  - Here's Nana!

725
00:49:47,986 --> 00:49:50,921
- Hey! Leave my Nana alone!
- Silence, squeaky-voiced human child!

726
00:49:53,266 --> 00:49:55,122
I got Nana's controller!

727
00:49:56,275 --> 00:49:58,510
Free me! Free me, or face the consequence!

728
00:49:58,578 --> 00:50:02,736
- In here.
- You don't trap me! I trap you! Why, you--

729
00:50:04,467 --> 00:50:06,193
Shake all you want. We own you.

730
00:50:08,114 --> 00:50:10,962
The suitcase! Go!

731
00:50:14,705 --> 00:50:16,200
Ha! You missed me.

732
00:50:16,658 --> 00:50:18,507
Stand still, Earth burgers!

733
00:50:18,961 --> 00:50:20,554
Ha! Got him!

734
00:50:20,625 --> 00:50:23,210
Don't let 'em take Snuggle Lump!

735
00:50:23,281 --> 00:50:25,225
Art, wait!

736
00:50:25,299 --> 00:50:27,850
- Shoot him! Shoot the humans!
- Incoming!

737
00:50:27,922 --> 00:50:30,988
- Shoot 'em up!
- Hit the deck!

738
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,983
- You lose.
- Zirkon forever!

739
00:50:37,713 --> 00:50:40,396
I'm sorry, Hannah. I'm sorry. They got hi m.

740
00:50:41,201 --> 00:50:43,787
- Sweet, huh?
- Very nice.

741
00:50:43,857 --> 00:50:46,157
This is the Creek Landing
Sheriff's Department.

742
00:50:46,224 --> 00:50:49,869
Open this door at once,
or I will begin forcible entry...

743
00:50:49,936 --> 00:50:51,792
in 10, 9...

744
00:50:51,857 --> 00:50:55,119
- 8, 7, 6... - You guys get rid of the cop.
I'm going after the aliens.

745
00:50:55,185 --> 00:50:57,288
5, 4--

746
00:50:57,360 --> 00:51:00,208
- We can't leave him up here.
- 2, 1.

747
00:51:00,273 --> 00:51:03,655
I don't know how much you kids
know about penal codes...

748
00:51:03,728 --> 00:51:07,076
but making phone calls with the intent
to annoy or harass is a serious offense.

749
00:51:07,151 --> 00:51:10,796
It's called criminal mischief.
And it could mean 6 months in jail.

750
00:51:10,864 --> 00:51:13,733
911 is for emergency calls only.

751
00:51:13,809 --> 00:51:17,669
- Any misuse of this system compromises
this county's...  - Weapons.

752
00:51:17,744 --> 00:51:20,810
only line of defense, and that's me.

753
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:22,920
Around here, I am the law.

754
00:51:22,992 --> 00:51:26,340
Literally, I'm the only one.
My deputy's on maternity leave.

755
00:51:26,415 --> 00:51:29,545
Look, Sheriff, we told you we're sorry.
It won't happen again.

756
00:51:29,615 --> 00:51:31,470
So, really, you can leave now.
We'll be good.

757
00:51:31,535 --> 00:51:34,830
Oh, I can leave?
Okay, we got the whole problem solved.

758
00:51:37,903 --> 00:51:39,466
Hey, what's that there?

759
00:51:40,111 --> 00:51:42,980
Squadron, come in. Come in.
Do you have Sparks?

760
00:51:43,055 --> 00:51:46,349
- No. - Is there any job
you two can't screw up?

761
00:51:47,181 --> 00:51:48,201
Come in!

762
00:51:49,134 --> 00:51:50,988
I'm sorry. I apologize.
That was uncalled for.

763
00:51:51,054 --> 00:51:55,243
- You're still trapped in that box, aren't you?
- Yes, I am.

764
00:51:55,309 --> 00:51:58,245
- Step aside, young man.
- No need for that.

765
00:51:58,318 --> 00:52:02,726
It's just my sister's robot dog.
It's sound activated. Right, Han?

766
00:52:02,798 --> 00:52:05,351
Right. It's not an alien.

767
00:52:07,598 --> 00:52:11,427
You know what? I'm gonna take a look
inside that chest, so please step aside.

768
00:52:22,732 --> 00:52:26,246
It's the po-po. Be cool.

769
00:52:27,788 --> 00:52:30,724
One hour. We're gone one hour.
What happened? What'd you kids do?

770
00:52:30,798 --> 00:52:33,131
Hi. Nina Pearson. Are you kids okay?

771
00:52:33,196 --> 00:52:35,367
- Is everything okay?
- No, ma'am.

772
00:52:35,436 --> 00:52:40,008
I'd say making a fraudulent call to 911 about
an alien invasion is most definitely not okay.

773
00:52:40,076 --> 00:52:42,180
- You called 911?
- Come on, buddy.

774
00:52:42,251 --> 00:52:45,864
I'm sure you can let these kids off
with a warning. Look at 'em.

775
00:52:45,932 --> 00:52:48,267
1, not your buddy.

776
00:52:48,333 --> 00:52:51,747
2, notice that your vehicle
is missing a front license plate.

777
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:54,951
- 3, how about I write you up a ticket?
- How about you don't?

778
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:56,994
Nate, stop talking.

779
00:52:57,068 --> 00:52:59,970
You people usually leave your
children unsupervised like this?

780
00:53:00,043 --> 00:53:02,978
No. No, not at all.
We had to go into town to the leasing office.

781
00:53:03,051 --> 00:53:04,992
They shut our power off.

782
00:53:05,067 --> 00:53:07,240
Looks all right to me.

783
00:53:07,307 --> 00:53:10,209
Sheriff, I know this isn't
something to be taken lightly...

784
00:53:10,283 --> 00:53:12,257
but honestly, they are really good kids.

785
00:53:12,331 --> 00:53:15,364
Why don't you stay and see for yourself?
We're barbecuing.

786
00:53:15,435 --> 00:53:17,638
-Join us.
- Mom--

787
00:53:17,707 --> 00:53:19,845
Thank you, ma'am.
I'd like to, but I am on duty.

788
00:53:19,916 --> 00:53:24,039
Look. The kids made a big mistake.
And I assure you, Tom will be punished.

789
00:53:24,107 --> 00:53:26,922
But my wife is right. We got plenty
of great food. Why don't you stick around?

790
00:53:26,987 --> 00:53:30,434
I know you're on the job, but there's no law
against a home-cooked meal.

791
00:53:30,506 --> 00:53:35,078
Got lots of hot dogs, hamburgers, steaks and--

792
00:53:38,699 --> 00:53:40,291
Okay.

793
00:53:44,810 --> 00:53:46,599
I have to admit, it has been a while.

794
00:53:46,666 --> 00:53:48,902
- All right. Arm successfully twisted.
- Great.

795
00:53:48,970 --> 00:53:51,043
I guess an hour off won't kill anyone.

796
00:53:51,401 --> 00:53:52,419
No.

797
00:53:54,121 --> 00:53:55,142
Gotcha.

798
00:53:55,786 --> 00:53:56,942
Hey!

799
00:54:00,009 --> 00:54:01,832
What was that?

800
00:54:01,898 --> 00:54:04,264
- What was what?
- I don't know. I felt something.

801
00:54:04,330 --> 00:54:06,184
- Come on, everyone. Dinner.
- Let me help you with the bags.

802
00:54:06,249 --> 00:54:08,072
Inside. I've got the desserts.

803
00:54:13,417 --> 00:54:15,783
- You're going down, punk!
- You're going down, punk.

804
00:54:15,848 --> 00:54:17,705
- I just said that.
- I just said that.

805
00:54:17,770 --> 00:54:20,671
- Stop that.
- Stop that.

806
00:54:24,296 --> 00:54:25,447
You've been punked.

807
00:54:28,424 --> 00:54:30,120
Hail Zirkonia.

808
00:54:35,656 --> 00:54:39,453
Okay, now hold on, Mom.
I'm not following. Now, what happened?

809
00:54:39,528 --> 00:54:41,633
One moment I'm cleaning my chompers...

810
00:54:41,704 --> 00:54:44,770
and then the next thing
you know, I'm down here.

811
00:54:44,841 --> 00:54:47,588
You know, you're entitled to
a few senior moments at your age.

812
00:54:47,656 --> 00:54:49,859
I'm sorry, sweetie. I forgot.
Did you want cheese on your burger?

813
00:54:49,928 --> 00:54:54,182
No. I want to find whoever invented love
and hack him apart with a machete.

814
00:54:56,998 --> 00:54:59,682
- Boy trouble.
- That makes 2 of us.

815
00:54:59,751 --> 00:55:04,421
- I don't know what to do about this Tom situation.
- We have a guest. Happy face.

816
00:55:04,487 --> 00:55:07,716
- Hey, Nate, where's Jake?
- I have no idea.

817
00:55:07,783 --> 00:55:10,401
Well, dinner's almost ready.
How about you track him down?

818
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:14,179
Jake's an adult.
If he wants to eat, he'll come down and get it.

819
00:55:14,247 --> 00:55:16,897
- Oh, sorry.
- That will raise welts.

820
00:55:16,966 --> 00:55:20,708
- Excuse us.
- No. Pardon me. Watch your head.

821
00:55:22,501 --> 00:55:25,120
I tell you, there's nothing more American
than a charred chunk of meat...

822
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:26,182
hittin' your stomach.

823
00:55:27,110 --> 00:55:28,965
- I bought the pickles.
- Really?

824
00:55:29,030 --> 00:55:32,826
If you think a dill spear is gonna get you
out of that ticket, it's a no-go, mister.

825
00:55:44,902 --> 00:55:46,755
My stomach. I'm starving.

826
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:49,691
- Any word from Jake?
- Still no signal.

827
00:55:49,765 --> 00:55:51,838
- Where is he?
- Hey, boys. None of that at the table.

828
00:55:51,909 --> 00:55:55,421
Right, Nate?
They're playing with their phones.

829
00:55:55,492 --> 00:55:57,980
Oh, yeah. Slap it on.

830
00:56:01,765 --> 00:56:05,376
Hey, Hannah, did you eat all the hot dogs?

831
00:56:05,443 --> 00:56:06,404
No.

832
00:56:07,588 --> 00:56:09,627
I mean, yes.

833
00:56:11,428 --> 00:56:15,203
Gotta tell ya, this sure beats
eating ramen noodles in my squad car...

834
00:56:15,268 --> 00:56:17,439
every day by myself.

835
00:56:19,492 --> 00:56:21,696
Comfortable up there, Earth boy?

836
00:56:21,764 --> 00:56:24,065
- Hope so.
- Enjoy some dirt in your face.

837
00:56:24,516 --> 00:56:26,237
Help!

838
00:56:28,452 --> 00:56:31,102
Attention, all. Resistance is futile.
Give me what I need.

839
00:56:31,459 --> 00:56:33,821
Oh, baby. I knew you'd come back.

840
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:35,714
Step aside, hormonal female.

841
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:37,984
Wait. You're calling me hormonal?

842
00:56:38,052 --> 00:56:40,954
Back away.
You are irrelevant to my mission.

843
00:56:41,028 --> 00:56:42,621
Irrelevant?

844
00:56:42,692 --> 00:56:45,855
I don't care how old you are.
You can't talk to me like that!

845
00:56:45,923 --> 00:56:48,192
What is going on?

846
00:56:48,259 --> 00:56:49,785
Teen drama. I-I think.

847
00:56:49,859 --> 00:56:52,096
It is teen drama, right, Ricky?

848
00:56:52,164 --> 00:56:53,951
- Snuggles!
- Turn him off.

849
00:56:54,018 --> 00:56:56,637
- It's not me.
- Snuggles!

850
00:56:56,707 --> 00:56:59,707
- Let's move. Bring Nana.
- Freeze.

851
00:57:01,412 --> 00:57:03,422
You kids have not been excused.

852
00:57:04,547 --> 00:57:06,784
Let them go!

853
00:57:06,851 --> 00:57:11,357
We're playin' a game, Uncle Stu-- I mean, Stu.

854
00:57:11,426 --> 00:57:15,288
We're on vacation. Am I aging backwards?

855
00:57:15,362 --> 00:57:19,737
Yeah, I don't think so. You really want
to deny me my time with the kids?

856
00:57:21,249 --> 00:57:23,641
Guilt never gets old. Well, go ahead.

857
00:57:26,882 --> 00:57:30,395
I think we oughta keep Mom
out of the pinot grigio.

858
00:57:47,298 --> 00:57:51,705
You have lost.
And now the invasion shall begin.

859
00:57:51,777 --> 00:57:54,111
Invasion? You mean there's
more of you guys coming?

860
00:57:54,176 --> 00:57:57,788
Many more. And we will crush you like bugs.

861
00:57:57,857 --> 00:58:01,434
- Not if we crush you first.
- I will not be beaten by children.

862
00:58:01,503 --> 00:58:06,239
Anymore signs of resistance,
and the one you call Jake will be eliminated.

863
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:09,945
- I want Snuggle Lump back!
- That's it.

864
00:58:10,016 --> 00:58:11,871
Time to die.

865
00:58:14,239 --> 00:58:15,264
Richard?

866
00:58:15,424 --> 00:58:17,429
You remember Nana.

867
00:58:18,657 --> 00:58:20,182
Game on.

868
00:58:20,255 --> 00:58:22,262
Game over.

869
00:58:43,070 --> 00:58:46,810
- What was that move?
- Double right-thumb click with a left-panel twist.

870
00:58:47,967 --> 00:58:49,656
Chinese get up!

871
00:58:53,758 --> 00:58:56,061
He's on the light! Send Nana after him!

872
00:58:58,047 --> 00:59:01,461
- Nana!
- Lee! Flying's your specialty.

873
00:59:23,004 --> 00:59:23,900
Take him out, Lee.

874
00:59:23,965 --> 00:59:26,867
- Thumb cramp. Thumb cramp!
- Give it to me.

875
00:59:45,405 --> 00:59:47,738
- Ricky?
- What the--

876
00:59:51,196 --> 00:59:53,171
Nana?

877
01:00:02,139 --> 01:00:05,457
Yes, scream, human,
for your species ends tonight.

878
01:00:08,764 --> 01:00:11,033
What the heck was that thing?

879
01:00:11,099 --> 01:00:14,328
Space alien. Too much to explain.

880
01:00:14,395 --> 01:00:17,112
We think they're probably here
to destroy the world as we know it.

881
01:00:17,179 --> 01:00:19,928
If we don't get down there,
we're gonna be in real trouble.

882
01:00:19,995 --> 01:00:22,296
I'd say that's the
understatement of the century.

883
01:00:24,123 --> 01:00:26,162
Mom? Are you okay?

884
01:00:28,219 --> 01:00:32,976
What-- What happened?
How-- How did I get--

885
01:00:33,051 --> 01:00:34,996
I think I need a glass of water.

886
01:00:35,643 --> 01:00:38,163
Okay. Somebody better start talking.

887
01:00:38,234 --> 01:00:41,944
It looks like you guys
had a battle royal in here.

888
01:00:42,011 --> 01:00:44,345
- We did. Nana versus Ricky.
- Not now, Hannah.

889
01:00:44,409 --> 01:00:47,376
- Dad, it's not what it looks like.
- All of you, upstairs, now.

890
01:00:47,450 --> 01:00:50,100
- But, Uncle Stu, it wasn't our fault.
- Now.

891
01:00:53,594 --> 01:00:55,601
Get up.

892
01:00:55,673 --> 01:00:59,121
Okay, unless you wanna join them,
you better spill it.

893
01:00:59,193 --> 01:01:01,298
What the heck happened in here?

894
01:01:01,369 --> 01:01:03,377
I haven't got a clue as to what happened...

895
01:01:03,450 --> 01:01:06,798
but my back hasn't felt this good in ages.

896
01:01:08,441 --> 01:01:11,059
Mom? Mom? Where you goin'?

897
01:01:11,128 --> 01:01:13,136
Aliens.

898
01:01:21,593 --> 01:01:24,375
Build machine... now.

899
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:26,481
No.

900
01:01:34,391 --> 01:01:36,530
I'm sorry, guys.

901
01:01:37,752 --> 01:01:39,607
It's over.

902
01:01:39,673 --> 01:01:42,061
Over? It better not be over.

903
01:01:42,136 --> 01:01:47,024
Ricky is down in the basement
with that... space rodent.

904
01:01:47,096 --> 01:01:50,325
You don't get it. An entire fleet
of those guys are about to invade.

905
01:01:50,392 --> 01:01:52,463
Well, man up and deal with it.

906
01:01:52,536 --> 01:01:55,088
I have been... all day.

907
01:01:55,159 --> 01:01:58,126
Well, if he's too scared,
maybe you guys can help me.

908
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:01,648
- Not without Tom.
- Why?

909
01:02:01,719 --> 01:02:03,180
'Cause he's our leader.

910
01:02:05,207 --> 01:02:09,430
Come on. It's not just Ricky.
Jake needs your help too.

911
01:02:09,496 --> 01:02:11,404
And Snuggles.

912
01:02:11,479 --> 01:02:14,293
And, like, everyone on Earth,
including our parents.

913
01:02:23,671 --> 01:02:25,263
All right.

914
01:02:25,335 --> 01:02:27,855
Let's go save the planet.

915
01:02:28,759 --> 01:02:31,857
And your dumb old boyfriend.

916
01:03:00,245 --> 01:03:03,245
You want Monkey? He's good luck.

917
01:03:04,852 --> 01:03:05,898
I'm fine.

918
01:03:09,332 --> 01:03:11,504
Stay close.

919
01:03:11,572 --> 01:03:14,093
They could be anywhere.

920
01:03:49,970 --> 01:03:51,210
It's Jake!

921
01:03:52,978 --> 01:03:56,045
Those Zirkonians--
They tied me up and dragged Snuggles outside.

922
01:03:56,115 --> 01:03:57,970
This vacation really sucks.

923
01:03:58,035 --> 01:04:00,784
- You see the machine?
- Yeah. You were right. It was sent here years ago.

924
01:04:00,851 --> 01:04:02,858
Some idiot built this place
smack on top of it.

925
01:04:02,931 --> 01:04:05,200
Guys? Guys, I found Ricky.

926
01:04:05,267 --> 01:04:07,568
- He's waking up.
- Where in the heck am I?

927
01:04:07,634 --> 01:04:10,569
Oh, baby, I'm so glad you're okay.

928
01:04:11,283 --> 01:04:13,650
Don't touch me!

929
01:04:15,570 --> 01:04:17,130
- Stop.
- Okay, okay.

930
01:04:17,201 --> 01:04:21,479
I know it's been a really weird day,
but you have to let me explain.

931
01:04:21,554 --> 01:04:24,652
Okay. Okay.

932
01:04:24,723 --> 01:04:28,203
Explain to me why I keep blacking out,
why I'm bleeding...

933
01:04:28,273 --> 01:04:32,528
and why your grandma did
a flying ninja kick on my face down the stairs.

934
01:04:32,593 --> 01:04:34,601
Okay.

935
01:04:34,674 --> 01:04:37,640
We're fighting-- space aliens.

936
01:04:37,713 --> 01:04:39,174
Yeah. Yeah.

937
01:04:39,249 --> 01:04:42,926
Okay, they're small,
but dangerous and-- and really scary.

938
01:04:42,994 --> 01:04:45,328
No. Of course.
I believe you. Why wouldn't they be?

939
01:04:45,393 --> 01:04:49,287
Why do you want to waste our time
playing hide-and-seek and kill the aliens...

940
01:04:49,361 --> 01:04:51,728
with your stupid brother
and your dumb little cousins?

941
01:04:55,153 --> 01:04:57,159
Don't talk about my family like that.

942
01:04:57,232 --> 01:05:00,647
Well, you don't have to worry about it anymore
'cause we're done.

943
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:04,168
I knew I should have stayed home
and hooked up with Annie Filkins.

944
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:07,404
She's smokin' hot, and she doesn't like
talking about feelings all the time.

945
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:10,728
I'm goin' straight to Annie's.

946
01:05:20,432 --> 01:05:22,733
I'm really sorry.

947
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:25,516
Don't be. You were right all along.

948
01:05:25,583 --> 01:05:29,479
If it's any consolation,
he's not going straight to Annie's.

949
01:05:29,551 --> 01:05:31,406
Or anywhere for a while.

950
01:05:33,777 --> 01:05:36,678
Guys? Enough of this sibling bonding.
We're at DEFCON 1 here.

951
01:05:42,864 --> 01:05:46,441
Go. Go! Rookie.

952
01:05:47,919 --> 01:05:51,530
Oh, my God.
They're forcing him to build it.

953
01:05:51,598 --> 01:05:54,446
Build what? How do you take over
the world with that thing?

954
01:05:54,510 --> 01:05:57,577
I really don't want to find out.
We gotta stop them before their fleet arrives.

955
01:05:57,646 --> 01:06:00,330
- Fleet?
- This is just the advance team.

956
01:06:00,399 --> 01:06:02,952
- We have to rescue Snuggle Lump.
- Snuggle what?

957
01:06:03,021 --> 01:06:05,956
Lump. The foreign fella. He's on our side.

958
01:06:06,030 --> 01:06:08,877
The other 3-- not so much.

959
01:06:08,942 --> 01:06:12,238
- This is so not happening.
- We gotta get out there. Let's move.

960
01:06:12,302 --> 01:06:17,036
Not so fast. I have a plan. Work with
me here. Did Nana give anyone Mentos?

961
01:06:17,102 --> 01:06:18,956
- Why?
- Hand 'em over!

962
01:06:19,022 --> 01:06:22,088
- What, we're gonna throw candy at them?
- No.

963
01:06:22,158 --> 01:06:24,361
My own little science project.

964
01:06:30,669 --> 01:06:32,709
Mentos bomb. You're a genius.

965
01:06:32,781 --> 01:06:34,536
You shouldn't do this.

966
01:06:34,604 --> 01:06:37,158
- Humans friendly.
- Incoming!

967
01:06:38,636 --> 01:06:41,026
In my eyes!

968
01:06:41,102 --> 01:06:42,562
- Let's get 'em!
- Move!

969
01:06:45,261 --> 01:06:48,163
- Snuggles!
- Traitor.

970
01:06:51,021 --> 01:06:54,467
- Release me.
- Never mess with a girl who just got dumped.

971
01:06:57,164 --> 01:06:59,881
He's out cold.

972
01:06:59,948 --> 01:07:02,403
- You!
- Get off my planet, you little green son of a--

973
01:07:17,356 --> 01:07:20,672
- How do you feel now?
- Weakness-- We found their weakness!

974
01:07:20,747 --> 01:07:24,008
- It's their own death ray.
- Yes!

975
01:07:24,075 --> 01:07:28,102
Bad. Not sweet. So not sweet.

976
01:07:32,907 --> 01:07:35,176
- Hey! Humans.
- Hey, listen.

977
01:07:35,243 --> 01:07:39,879
The machine molecule expands.
Machine make commander big.

978
01:07:44,682 --> 01:07:48,162
Who's little now, Earth maggots?

979
01:07:48,234 --> 01:07:52,064
- Pretty cool, huh?
- You're gonna need a bigger potato.

980
01:07:52,138 --> 01:07:54,505
It's over. I win.

981
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:57,440
- Where's he going?
- Anywhere he wants.

982
01:07:57,515 --> 01:08:00,296
- What about Mommy and Daddy?
- Tom will figure it out.

983
01:08:11,721 --> 01:08:13,827
Everyone, listen. We don't have much time.

984
01:08:13,898 --> 01:08:16,353
- Sparks, can anything go on that machine?
- Theoretically.

985
01:08:16,426 --> 01:08:18,629
Good. Art, Lee, I'm gonna need a controller.

986
01:08:18,697 --> 01:08:20,934
- Bethany, I need you to keep the
other aliens on lockdown.   - Okay.

987
01:08:23,881 --> 01:08:25,736
Jake, come on.

988
01:08:25,801 --> 01:08:28,069
- This battle's not over yet.
- Awesome.

989
01:08:30,183 --> 01:08:32,006
There.

990
01:08:32,072 --> 01:08:34,407
Cool. He super-sized it.

991
01:08:35,753 --> 01:08:37,760
You are one ugly alien.

992
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:43,361
He may be ugly, but he's mine.

993
01:08:43,432 --> 01:08:45,342
You don't know when to quit, do you?

994
01:08:48,263 --> 01:08:51,231
- We need a clean shot at his neck.
- I'm goin' up.

995
01:08:57,861 --> 01:09:01,126
- You broke my nail!
- I don't care.

996
01:09:13,830 --> 01:09:15,876
Oh, my gosh. They're beacons.

997
01:09:15,943 --> 01:09:17,764
He's calling the invasion.

998
01:09:21,414 --> 01:09:23,836
- Unbelievable.
- Look at this.

999
01:09:23,911 --> 01:09:27,653
God bless America.
Now that's what I call a patriot act.

1000
01:09:27,718 --> 01:09:30,717
It's not bad,
but it's nothin' compared to this.

1001
01:09:31,462 --> 01:09:34,587
Those are category-3
pyrotechnics you got there.

1002
01:09:34,662 --> 01:09:36,604
I suppose that's another ticket.

1003
01:09:38,693 --> 01:09:41,181
Light 'em up. Let's put that guy to shame.

1004
01:09:43,878 --> 01:09:46,148
I got it! Tom! Tom, I found it.

1005
01:09:48,358 --> 01:09:51,173
Get him to turn around!

1006
01:09:51,238 --> 01:09:55,427
Hey! Down here, you prehistoric space scum!

1007
01:10:01,956 --> 01:10:04,540
- Nice one, Nate.
- That was awesome!

1008
01:10:04,899 --> 01:10:08,223
Those things only cost $1.99.
Can you believe it?

1009
01:10:08,293 --> 01:10:11,489
- I don't think that's you, Nate.
- What is that?

1010
01:10:11,558 --> 01:10:15,866
It's them. They'll all be coming soon.

1011
01:10:15,940 --> 01:10:18,396
Open your eyes, people.

1012
01:10:18,469 --> 01:10:21,152
There's only one answer-- meteor shower.

1013
01:10:21,221 --> 01:10:25,017
- Oh, that's right. I heard on the radio.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1014
01:10:30,403 --> 01:10:31,839
Is that all ya got?

1015
01:10:32,964 --> 01:10:35,582
- Hey.
- Come on!

1016
01:10:37,412 --> 01:10:39,867
Tom! Take the shot!

1017
01:10:39,940 --> 01:10:43,551
- Shoot him!
- His collar's still in the way.

1018
01:10:43,619 --> 01:10:46,714
Look out! The ugly one got big!

1019
01:10:47,075 --> 01:10:50,970
- Hurry. Do it, Tom!
- 50 yards.

1020
01:10:51,043 --> 01:10:55,069
Angle equals one-half arc sine of gravity
times distance over velocity squared.

1021
01:10:55,140 --> 01:10:57,344
45 degrees.

1022
01:10:57,412 --> 01:10:59,746
What was that?

1023
01:11:01,827 --> 01:11:04,762
You messed with the wrong mathlete.

1024
01:11:13,538 --> 01:11:15,065
- Yes.
- Get him away from him.

1025
01:11:15,137 --> 01:11:17,374
Commander. Hey, wait a second.

1026
01:11:19,139 --> 01:11:21,505
Take that.

1027
01:11:21,571 --> 01:11:24,439
- Puny humans, is that all you have?
- He's good.

1028
01:11:28,226 --> 01:11:30,135
No, you don't.

1029
01:11:31,553 --> 01:11:33,341
You see that?

1030
01:11:33,409 --> 01:11:36,311
Sparks! Reverse the machine.

1031
01:11:46,658 --> 01:11:47,874
Too easy.

1032
01:11:51,264 --> 01:11:53,336
- Nothing's working.
- Give it to me.

1033
01:11:56,929 --> 01:11:59,068
- Crude.
- But effective.

1034
01:11:59,138 --> 01:12:00,287
That was awesome.

1035
01:12:03,744 --> 01:12:06,396
- Reversed.
- Tommy, he's done.

1036
01:12:18,337 --> 01:12:20,856
- You came back for me.
- Let's go.

1037
01:12:20,927 --> 01:12:23,383
We can hug lips on Zirkon.

1038
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:35,167
Bethany!

1039
01:12:35,232 --> 01:12:36,660
- Hannah, are you okay?
- Yeah.

1040
01:12:36,735 --> 01:12:39,068
Over here. Did you guys see that?
Great job, Hannah.

1041
01:12:39,134 --> 01:12:42,517
- Snugs was great. So were you guys.
- Tom, what about the others?

1042
01:12:42,591 --> 01:12:45,405
There's so many.

1043
01:12:51,391 --> 01:12:54,555
Retreat. Retreat. The machine is destroyed.

1044
01:12:54,623 --> 01:12:58,071
We have been outsmarted by the humans.

1045
01:12:58,142 --> 01:13:02,071
The invasion has failed.
Retreat to Zirkon right away.

1046
01:13:02,143 --> 01:13:05,142
Retreat. Retreat.

1047
01:13:12,317 --> 01:13:15,036
He's gone.

1048
01:13:15,103 --> 01:13:18,549
It's over. It's all over.

1049
01:13:18,621 --> 01:13:20,476
We won.

1050
01:13:22,557 --> 01:13:25,307
Thanks, Snugs, for everything.

1051
01:13:25,374 --> 01:13:28,340
You're all right for a space maggot.
I'm gonna miss you.

1052
01:13:28,414 --> 01:13:31,861
Miss him? He's staying here, with us.

1053
01:13:33,054 --> 01:13:35,736
Please don't go.
You can be a part of our family.

1054
01:13:48,028 --> 01:13:51,257
Han, I think he's already got a family.

1055
01:13:53,565 --> 01:13:55,474
My family.

1056
01:14:05,883 --> 01:14:07,633
Good-bye, Hannah.

1057
01:14:09,907 --> 01:14:15,469
Subtitles: Arigon

1058
01:14:52,219 --> 01:14:54,192
Hey.

1059
01:14:54,265 --> 01:14:56,175
Hey.

1060
01:14:58,809 --> 01:15:02,803
- Listen, about your grades--
- Dad, let me save you a lecture.

1061
01:15:02,874 --> 01:15:05,590
You were right, and I was wrong.

1062
01:15:05,657 --> 01:15:09,487
Turns out there are advantages
to being smart.

1063
01:15:10,842 --> 01:15:12,752
I'm sorry.

1064
01:15:14,521 --> 01:15:16,561
I had this really great lecture planned.

1065
01:15:16,634 --> 01:15:19,634
Even rehearsed it in front of the mirror.

1066
01:15:25,369 --> 01:15:27,224
Did you see the meteor shower?

1067
01:15:27,289 --> 01:15:29,460
Yeah. Yeah, it was life-changing.

1068
01:15:34,521 --> 01:15:37,390
- Nice cast, Nana.
- Hey.

1069
01:15:38,423 --> 01:15:40,367
Got a bite. Got a bite.
Oh, yeah.

1070
01:15:40,441 --> 01:15:42,861
Oh, yeah. Come on.

1071
01:15:57,688 --> 01:16:01,463
* You're out of this world, I'm sure

1072
01:16:03,703 --> 01:16:06,933
- Annie!
- Ricky, I thought you were at your lake house.

1073
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:10,131
- Vacation ended early. These are for you.
- You're so sweet.

1074
01:16:10,199 --> 01:16:12,173
Hey, you're my girlfriend now.

1075
01:16:12,247 --> 01:16:15,411
So there is nothing I wouldn't do for you.
Now give papa some--

1076
01:16:17,972 --> 01:16:18,901
Ladies.

1077
01:16:18,904 --> 01:16:22,066
It's girls' night out.
But, hey, you should come--

1078
01:16:22,327 --> 01:16:25,840
- If you like dancing.
- Dancing?

1079
01:16:26,486 --> 01:16:28,016
You ain't even seen dancing--

1080
01:16:28,086 --> 01:16:31,020
Till you've seen funky Ricky.

1081
01:16:41,141 --> 01:16:43,314
Wedgie time.

1082
01:16:43,383 --> 01:16:44,943
Cannonball.

1083
01:16:45,014 --> 01:16:46,672
