1
00:02:54,629 --> 00:02:56,701
Bow to the board.

2
00:02:57,702 --> 00:02:59,589
This is the boy.

3
00:03:00,037 --> 00:03:03,714
Born here in the workhouse.
Moved to the parish farm.

4
00:03:03,909 --> 00:03:07,454
Nine years old today.
Time to be moved back here.

5
00:03:07,652 --> 00:03:08,896
What's your name, boy?

6
00:03:14,244 --> 00:03:15,804
-Oliver Twist.
-What?

7
00:03:16,003 --> 00:03:19,419
-That boy's a fool.
-Boy. Listen to me.

8
00:03:20,004 --> 00:03:21,913
You know you are an orphan,
I suppose.

9
00:03:22,115 --> 00:03:24,385
-What's that?
-The boy is a fool. I thought he was.

10
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,684
You know you've got
no father or mother...

11
00:03:26,884 --> 00:03:29,437
...and that you were brought up
by the parish, don't you?

12
00:03:29,635 --> 00:03:32,090
-Yes, sir.
-What are you crying for?

13
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:34,941
I hope you say your prayers
every night.

14
00:03:35,138 --> 00:03:38,750
Pray for those that feed you
and take care of you...

15
00:03:38,946 --> 00:03:40,091
...Iike a Christian.

16
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:42,113
-Yes, sir.
-Well...

17
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:44,129
...you have come here
to be educated...

18
00:03:44,323 --> 00:03:46,559
...and to be taught a useful trade.

19
00:03:58,914 --> 00:04:01,183
Here, where do you want these?

20
00:04:16,961 --> 00:04:19,033
Learn from the boy next to you.

21
00:04:19,232 --> 00:04:23,193
-What am I to learn, sir?
-Learn to pick out the oakum.

22
00:04:23,392 --> 00:04:24,668
What's oakum, sir?

23
00:04:25,185 --> 00:04:27,324
Stop asking so many questions.

24
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,716
Oakum's the fibers you unpick
from the old rope.

25
00:04:30,912 --> 00:04:34,905
Then it's used again
for the ships of Her Majesty's navy.

26
00:04:35,103 --> 00:04:37,208
You're serving your country.

27
00:04:37,408 --> 00:04:38,934
Now, get on with it.

28
00:05:11,005 --> 00:05:14,781
Tom, give it a rest, will you?
We're trying to sleep.

29
00:05:17,631 --> 00:05:20,729
-Can't sleep, too hungry.
-We're all hungry.

30
00:05:20,925 --> 00:05:23,292
Yes, but I'm frightened.

31
00:05:23,485 --> 00:05:24,980
Frightened? Why?

32
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:27,543
Why? Why?

33
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:32,050
I'm so hungry, I'm frightened I might
eat the lad that sleeps next to me.

34
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,632
O Lord God...

35
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:10,703
...for the blessing of this generous
and bountiful meal...

36
00:06:10,906 --> 00:06:12,913
...that thou hast placed before us...

37
00:06:13,113 --> 00:06:15,731
...we give thanks. Amen.

38
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:18,198
Amen.

39
00:07:35,061 --> 00:07:37,778
Please, sir. I want some more.

40
00:07:40,054 --> 00:07:41,547
What?

41
00:07:41,749 --> 00:07:44,138
Please, sir, I want some more.

42
00:07:54,964 --> 00:07:57,003
Fetch the beadle!

43
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,888
Mr. Limbkins.

44
00:08:07,603 --> 00:08:09,610
I beg your pardon, sir.

45
00:08:09,811 --> 00:08:12,113
Oliver Twist has asked for more.

46
00:08:13,107 --> 00:08:14,863
For more?!

47
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,677
Compose yourself, Mr. Bumble,
and answer me distinctly.

48
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:22,282
Do I understand that he asked for
more after he had eaten his supper?

49
00:08:22,482 --> 00:08:23,692
He did, sir.

50
00:08:27,475 --> 00:08:29,417
That boy will be hanged.

51
00:08:40,594 --> 00:08:43,855
"Five pounds and a b--"

52
00:08:46,674 --> 00:08:50,983
When I says "whoa,"
I means "whoa"!

53
00:08:53,297 --> 00:08:54,923
"Health-- Healthy...

54
00:08:55,121 --> 00:08:58,383
...appren-- apprentice.

55
00:08:58,577 --> 00:09:00,748
Five pounds."

56
00:09:01,361 --> 00:09:04,143
Chimney sweeping is a nasty trade.

57
00:09:04,337 --> 00:09:08,526
Young boys have been smothered
in chimneys before now.

58
00:09:08,721 --> 00:09:11,819
That's because they damp the straw
afore they light it in the chimney...

59
00:09:12,015 --> 00:09:15,660
...to make them come out again.
Damp straw makes smoke.

60
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:18,855
Smoke sends a boy to sleep,
and that's what he wants.

61
00:09:19,055 --> 00:09:20,965
Boys is very lazy, gentlemen.

62
00:09:21,167 --> 00:09:24,483
But there's nothing like a good hot
blaze to make them come out in a run.

63
00:09:25,455 --> 00:09:27,560
It's humane too. Yes.

64
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:30,693
Because even if they've
stuck in the chimney...

65
00:09:30,895 --> 00:09:35,750
...roasting their feet makes them
struggle to extricate theirselves.

66
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,227
Yes.

67
00:09:37,423 --> 00:09:39,245
I suppose he's fond of
chimney sweeping?

68
00:09:39,438 --> 00:09:41,577
He dotes on it, Your Worship.

69
00:09:41,773 --> 00:09:44,392
Very well. I will sign the indentures...

70
00:09:45,326 --> 00:09:48,392
...to make him Mr....

71
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:52,483
Mr. Gamfield's apprentice.

72
00:10:01,452 --> 00:10:02,565
My boy.

73
00:10:04,173 --> 00:10:08,265
My boy, you look pale and alarmed.

74
00:10:08,461 --> 00:10:09,574
What's the matter?

75
00:10:10,573 --> 00:10:12,907
Please, sir. Please, sir.

76
00:10:13,101 --> 00:10:15,075
What is it, my boy?

77
00:10:15,277 --> 00:10:16,967
-Don't....
-Now then.

78
00:10:17,164 --> 00:10:19,204
Don't.... Don't....

79
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,154
Go on, my boy. Don't what?

80
00:10:22,347 --> 00:10:25,380
Please don't send me away
with this dreadful man, sir.

81
00:10:26,091 --> 00:10:28,459
Of all the designing orphans
that I've ever seen....

82
00:10:28,653 --> 00:10:31,238
-Hold your tongue, beadle.
-Did Your Worship speak to me?

83
00:10:31,435 --> 00:10:33,891
Yes, hold your tongue.

84
00:10:35,372 --> 00:10:37,925
No. No, out of the question.

85
00:10:38,123 --> 00:10:41,897
We refuse to sanction
these indentures.

86
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:45,414
Take the boy away.

87
00:10:45,802 --> 00:10:48,006
And treat him kindly.

88
00:10:48,203 --> 00:10:50,724
He seems to want it.

89
00:11:06,473 --> 00:11:10,051
I've just taken the measure of
the two women that died last night.

90
00:11:10,248 --> 00:11:12,966
You'll make your fortune,
Mr. Sowerberry.

91
00:11:13,353 --> 00:11:15,361
Think so?

92
00:11:16,808 --> 00:11:19,525
The prices allowed by the board
are very small.

93
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:21,892
So are the coffins.

94
00:11:23,369 --> 00:11:27,940
By the by, you don't know anybody
who wants a boy, do you?

95
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:33,472
Liberal terms, Mr. Sowerberry.
Liberal terms.

96
00:11:42,088 --> 00:11:45,404
Now, as you are to meet
your new master...

97
00:11:45,607 --> 00:11:47,516
...pull that cap off your eyes.

98
00:11:49,351 --> 00:11:51,739
Hold your head up, sir.

99
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:55,551
Dry your eyes, sir.

100
00:12:01,447 --> 00:12:05,221
-ls that you, Bumble?
-No one else, Mr. Sowerberry.

101
00:12:05,415 --> 00:12:08,448
I've brought the orphan,
Oliver Twist.

102
00:12:08,646 --> 00:12:11,166
So this is the orphan, is it?

103
00:12:11,366 --> 00:12:12,741
Mrs. Sowerberry...

104
00:12:12,934 --> 00:12:15,967
...will you have the goodness
to come here a moment, my dear?

105
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:18,621
Oliver Twist.

106
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:21,026
How comes an orphan
to have any name at all?

107
00:12:21,221 --> 00:12:23,555
-I invented it.
-You, Mr. Bumble?

108
00:12:23,749 --> 00:12:25,276
I, Mr. Sowerberry.

109
00:12:25,477 --> 00:12:28,772
I name all our foundlings
in alphabetical order.

110
00:12:28,964 --> 00:12:30,590
The last was S.

111
00:12:30,788 --> 00:12:32,512
Swubble, I named him.

112
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:36,320
This was a T. Twist,
I named him.

113
00:12:36,516 --> 00:12:39,004
Next one as comes
will be Unwin...

114
00:12:39,204 --> 00:12:40,830
...and the next, Vilkins.

115
00:12:41,027 --> 00:12:44,640
I've got names ready
all through the alphabet, right up to Z.

116
00:12:44,836 --> 00:12:48,097
Why, you're quite
a literary character, sir.

117
00:12:48,292 --> 00:12:49,437
Well, well...

118
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:52,504
-...perhaps I may be.
-Mrs. Sowerberry...

119
00:12:52,706 --> 00:12:55,195
...this is the orphan
from the workhouse.

120
00:12:57,346 --> 00:12:58,753
Dear me, he's very small.

121
00:12:58,947 --> 00:13:00,856
But he'll grow, Mrs. Sowerberry.
He'll grow.

122
00:13:01,059 --> 00:13:05,369
Yes, I daresay he will.
On our food and drink.

123
00:13:05,571 --> 00:13:10,109
Workhouse boys always cost more
to keep than they're worth.

124
00:13:10,307 --> 00:13:13,471
Get downstairs, you bag of bones.

125
00:13:14,274 --> 00:13:15,681
Here, Charlotte...

126
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:19,387
...give this boy some of the cold bits
that were put by for the dog.

127
00:13:46,624 --> 00:13:49,242
You don't mind sleeping
among the coffins, I suppose.

128
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,742
Well, it doesn't much matter
whether you do or don't...

129
00:13:51,937 --> 00:13:54,325
...for you can't sleep anywhere else.

130
00:15:09,531 --> 00:15:11,921
Open the door, will you?

131
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:24,375
-You the new boy?
-Yes, sir.

132
00:15:24,571 --> 00:15:27,570
-How old are you?
-Ten, sir.

133
00:15:27,771 --> 00:15:31,731
Then I'll whop you one when I get in,
you workhouse brat.

134
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:50,066
I beg your pardon, sir.
Did you knock?

135
00:15:50,266 --> 00:15:51,410
I kicked.

136
00:15:51,609 --> 00:15:53,943
Did you want a coffin, sir?

137
00:15:54,137 --> 00:15:56,754
-You don't know who I am, I suppose.
-No, sir.

138
00:15:56,953 --> 00:16:00,248
Well, I'm Mr. Noah Claypole.
And you're under me.

139
00:16:00,441 --> 00:16:02,862
Now, take down the shutters.

140
00:16:07,481 --> 00:16:11,539
Saved a nice little bit of bacon for you
from the master's breakfast.

141
00:16:15,672 --> 00:16:18,967
In the corner with you.
And be quick about it.

142
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:22,193
They'll want you to mind the shop.
Do you hear?

143
00:16:22,392 --> 00:16:24,115
Do you hear, Workhouse?
In the corner.

144
00:16:24,312 --> 00:16:26,645
Oh, Lord, Noah, let the boy alone.

145
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:28,531
Let him alone?

146
00:16:28,728 --> 00:16:30,583
Why, everybody's let him alone.

147
00:16:30,776 --> 00:16:35,117
His mother, father and all
his relations has let him alone.

148
00:16:35,352 --> 00:16:37,807
So he needs someone who don't.

149
00:16:58,134 --> 00:16:59,279
Supper.

150
00:17:00,533 --> 00:17:02,322
Oliver, ain't you done yet?

151
00:17:02,997 --> 00:17:07,470
I've never known such an idle boy.
Get down them stairs.

152
00:17:07,669 --> 00:17:08,978
Mr. Sowerberry...

153
00:17:09,173 --> 00:17:10,798
...supper.

154
00:17:11,285 --> 00:17:14,034
-I've had a thought, my dear.
-Had a thought?

155
00:17:14,229 --> 00:17:16,946
You want to be careful,
Mr. Sowerberry, you'll get brain fever.

156
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:20,523
-It's about young Twist.
-What about him?

157
00:17:20,724 --> 00:17:24,106
-A very good-looking boy.
-He will be. He eats enough.

158
00:17:24,404 --> 00:17:28,681
There's an expression of melancholy
in his face, my dear.

159
00:17:28,884 --> 00:17:32,298
He would make a delightful mute,
my love.

160
00:17:33,139 --> 00:17:38,410
I-- I don't mean a regular mute to
attend grown-up funerals, my dear...

161
00:17:38,611 --> 00:17:42,255
...but only for children's practice.

162
00:17:55,986 --> 00:17:57,132
Look at him.

163
00:17:58,451 --> 00:17:59,596
Look at him.

164
00:18:00,562 --> 00:18:04,490
A workhouse boy and a sneak.
Look at him.

165
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:06,729
Mark my words, I'll see him hung.

166
00:18:07,218 --> 00:18:09,454
Can't be too soon.

167
00:18:11,729 --> 00:18:15,045
Workhouse, how's your mother?

168
00:18:16,048 --> 00:18:17,958
She's dead.

169
00:18:18,545 --> 00:18:20,934
What'd she die of, Workhouse?

170
00:18:23,506 --> 00:18:25,742
You gonna cry, Workhouse?

171
00:18:25,937 --> 00:18:29,232
-What set you off?
-Not you.

172
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:35,051
-Not me, eh?
-No, not you.

173
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,611
And you better not say anything
about my mother.

174
00:18:39,727 --> 00:18:41,615
Better not?

175
00:18:41,967 --> 00:18:43,822
About your mother?

176
00:18:44,017 --> 00:18:46,863
Well, I'm very sorry,
and I pity you very much.

177
00:18:47,056 --> 00:18:48,649
But you must know, Workhouse...

178
00:18:48,847 --> 00:18:50,919
...your mother was
a regular right-down bad one.

179
00:18:53,903 --> 00:18:56,804
-What did you say?
-A regular right-down bad one.

180
00:18:57,007 --> 00:18:58,730
It's a good thing she died
when she did...

181
00:18:58,926 --> 00:19:01,195
...or she'd be hard laboring
or transported.

182
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,587
Or hung. Which is most likely,
isn't it, Workhouse?

183
00:19:07,534 --> 00:19:09,225
Help, Mrs. Charlotte!

184
00:19:09,422 --> 00:19:11,113
He'll murder me. Help!

185
00:19:12,653 --> 00:19:14,595
Help. Get off!

186
00:19:15,022 --> 00:19:17,770
For God's sake, help me!

187
00:19:18,861 --> 00:19:20,933
My missus, he's murdering me!

188
00:19:21,133 --> 00:19:23,499
-Get off. Get off me now!
-Get him, Charlotte.

189
00:19:23,693 --> 00:19:26,181
Get him now. Go out with him.
Come on.

190
00:19:27,373 --> 00:19:30,373
-Workhouse devil.
-I'll learn you!

191
00:19:31,181 --> 00:19:33,253
-You brat!
-Get the door, Charlotte.

192
00:19:33,454 --> 00:19:35,395
In with him. In.

193
00:19:43,564 --> 00:19:46,084
Very violent indeed, sir.

194
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:48,262
And the missus said...

195
00:19:48,459 --> 00:19:50,981
...if Mr. Bumble can spare the time...

196
00:19:51,181 --> 00:19:53,766
...then Mr. Bumble's to flog him...

197
00:19:53,964 --> 00:19:55,719
...because the master's out.

198
00:20:00,683 --> 00:20:02,919
-ln there.
-Oliver?

199
00:20:03,115 --> 00:20:04,903
Let me out of here!

200
00:20:05,099 --> 00:20:07,717
-Do you know this here voice, Oliver?
-Yes.

201
00:20:07,914 --> 00:20:09,441
Ain't you afraid of it, sir?

202
00:20:09,643 --> 00:20:12,097
Ain't you trembling
while I speak, sir?

203
00:20:12,298 --> 00:20:14,023
No!

204
00:20:17,899 --> 00:20:20,549
-He must be mad.
-It's not madness, ma'am, it's meat.

205
00:20:20,746 --> 00:20:22,534
-Meat?
-Meat, ma'am, meat.

206
00:20:22,729 --> 00:20:23,875
You've overfed him.

207
00:20:24,074 --> 00:20:26,790
If you'd kept this boy on gruel,
this would never have happened.

208
00:20:26,986 --> 00:20:30,117
Dear, dear.
This comes of being liberal.

209
00:20:31,433 --> 00:20:32,643
What's all this?

210
00:20:32,841 --> 00:20:35,361
Oliver Twist has turned violent,
Mr. Sowerberry.

211
00:20:35,561 --> 00:20:38,179
Look what he's done to my eye, sir.

212
00:20:42,184 --> 00:20:44,289
Now then. Now then.

213
00:20:44,489 --> 00:20:48,165
-You're a nice young fellow, ain't you?
-He called my mother names.

214
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:52,222
Well, and what if he did,
you little ungrateful wretch!

215
00:20:52,423 --> 00:20:54,245
She deserved what he said
and worse.

216
00:20:54,439 --> 00:20:55,584
-She didn't!
-She did!

217
00:20:55,784 --> 00:20:57,409
It's a lie!

218
00:21:00,744 --> 00:21:05,478
Do something, Mr. Sowerberry.
He called me a liar.

219
00:21:06,856 --> 00:21:08,001
Do something!

220
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:26,971
I beg your pardon, miss...

221
00:24:27,645 --> 00:24:30,166
...but would you be so kind--?

222
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:32,955
Get off my land.

223
00:24:33,149 --> 00:24:35,668
I don't want no beggars here.
Go on!

224
00:24:35,868 --> 00:24:39,480
Get off! Or I'll put the dog on you!

225
00:25:17,369 --> 00:25:22,038
I haven't much,
but you're more than welcome to it.

226
00:25:22,457 --> 00:25:25,075
Be careful, it's hot.

227
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,513
Seeing you gave me such a turn.

228
00:25:39,192 --> 00:25:42,965
My eyes ain't what they were.
But...

229
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:46,639
...I just thought for a moment....

230
00:25:53,592 --> 00:25:57,966
Why are you on the road at all,
a little mite like you?

231
00:25:59,032 --> 00:26:01,715
-Where are you headed?
-London, ma'am.

232
00:26:02,135 --> 00:26:03,990
London?

233
00:26:04,727 --> 00:26:06,898
London.

234
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:10,925
Dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.

235
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,195
Hello, my man.

236
00:27:34,802 --> 00:27:37,038
And what's your game?

237
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:40,998
You're not from these parts?

238
00:27:42,416 --> 00:27:44,392
Where you from, then?

239
00:27:46,034 --> 00:27:48,816
I've been walking. Seven days.

240
00:27:49,009 --> 00:27:51,944
Seven days? Cor.

241
00:27:52,145 --> 00:27:53,290
I expect you want grub?

242
00:27:54,288 --> 00:27:55,947
And you shall have it.

243
00:27:56,145 --> 00:27:58,566
I'm at a low-water mark meself
just at the moment...

244
00:27:58,961 --> 00:28:01,164
...but I'll fork out and stump.

245
00:28:01,361 --> 00:28:04,010
Come on, up with you, on your pins.

246
00:28:10,672 --> 00:28:13,126
And these won't get out again?

247
00:28:13,327 --> 00:28:15,237
Thank you very much.

248
00:28:15,952 --> 00:28:17,162
Oh, by the by...

249
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:21,036
...my name is Jack Dawkins,
better known as the Artful Dodger.

250
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:23,434
Oliver Twist.

251
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:27,396
Why are you known as
the Artful Dodger?

252
00:28:28,014 --> 00:28:29,837
That's why.

253
00:28:37,071 --> 00:28:38,892
Got any lodgings?

254
00:28:39,085 --> 00:28:40,776
Money?

255
00:28:41,325 --> 00:28:44,641
I suppose you want someplace
to sleep tonight, don't you?

256
00:29:19,884 --> 00:29:21,127
Baby newt.

257
00:29:21,324 --> 00:29:24,422
Buy a baby newt, 4 pennies.

258
00:29:25,995 --> 00:29:29,290
I expect you walking for so long
was a beak's order.

259
00:29:29,482 --> 00:29:32,865
-What does that mean?
-Don't you know what a beak is?

260
00:29:33,066 --> 00:29:35,936
-A bird's mouth, isn't it?
-Cor, you are green.

261
00:29:36,139 --> 00:29:39,238
A beak's a magistrate, my son.
Where you been all your life?

262
00:29:39,435 --> 00:29:40,995
Get off me, you!

263
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:43,083
That's it, you asked for it.

264
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:49,959
Come back here.
I wanna talk to you.

265
00:29:50,666 --> 00:29:52,454
Lucky heather.

266
00:30:07,528 --> 00:30:10,976
--from where I am, mate,
I'm telling you.

267
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:14,566
Go home!

268
00:30:20,648 --> 00:30:22,721
Get off of that!

269
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,222
Go back home!

270
00:30:30,344 --> 00:30:32,765
-Now then.
-Plummy and slam.

271
00:30:34,823 --> 00:30:37,955
-There's two of you. Who's he?
-A new pal.

272
00:30:38,151 --> 00:30:39,973
-Where'd he come from?
-Greenland.

273
00:30:40,167 --> 00:30:43,614
-ls the old one there?
-Upstairs, sorting the wipes.

274
00:31:00,102 --> 00:31:03,451
This is him, Fagin.
My new friend, Oliver Twist.

275
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:07,396
Well, well, Oliver Twist.

276
00:31:09,094 --> 00:31:12,672
I hope I have the honor
of a more intimate acquaintance.

277
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:16,222
We're very glad to see you, Oliver.
Very.

278
00:31:16,421 --> 00:31:18,722
Dodger, take off the sausages...

279
00:31:18,917 --> 00:31:23,553
...and let's make a space
at the table for Oliver.

280
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:27,076
You were staring at the
pocket handkerchiefs, eh, my dear?

281
00:31:27,268 --> 00:31:29,157
There's a good many of them,
ain't there?

282
00:31:29,349 --> 00:31:31,389
We've just looked them out,
ready for the wash.

283
00:31:31,621 --> 00:31:33,409
That's all, my dear.

284
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:36,446
Blow it.

285
00:31:38,115 --> 00:31:41,017
Hot. Blow it.

286
00:31:41,219 --> 00:31:43,805
Now then, Oliver,
what you must have...

287
00:31:44,259 --> 00:31:47,390
...is a hot gin and water.
Warms the cockles.

288
00:31:47,587 --> 00:31:51,231
Only, drink it quick because another
of these gentlemen wants the tumbler.

289
00:32:12,258 --> 00:32:14,365
He's such a nice lad.

290
00:32:14,563 --> 00:32:17,858
I have a feeling he'll turn out
a hard worker.

291
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:20,319
Yeah, a hard worker.

292
00:32:44,641 --> 00:32:46,496
Oliver?

293
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,574
Oliver?

294
00:34:02,171 --> 00:34:04,276
Clever dogs.

295
00:34:09,308 --> 00:34:11,577
Clever dogs.

296
00:34:15,643 --> 00:34:18,065
Fine fellows.

297
00:34:20,922 --> 00:34:23,824
All fine fellows.

298
00:34:25,978 --> 00:34:29,362
Fine fellows.

299
00:34:29,563 --> 00:34:31,951
Fine fellows.

300
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:36,439
Fine fellows.

301
00:34:36,826 --> 00:34:39,575
Fine fellows.

302
00:34:45,241 --> 00:34:47,151
What do you watch me for?
Why are you awake?

303
00:34:47,353 --> 00:34:48,914
What have you seen?
Speak out, boy!

304
00:34:49,113 --> 00:34:51,152
Quick. Quick, or it's your life!

305
00:34:51,353 --> 00:34:53,328
I wasn't able to sleep
any longer, sir.

306
00:34:53,529 --> 00:34:54,958
I'm very sorry if I disturbed you.

307
00:34:55,161 --> 00:34:56,949
-You were not awake a moment ago?
-No, sir.

308
00:34:57,145 --> 00:34:59,217
-You sure?
-Yes, sir.

309
00:35:02,168 --> 00:35:05,201
Of course you were asleep, my dear.
I know that.

310
00:35:05,528 --> 00:35:07,120
I only tried to frighten you.

311
00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:10,093
You're a brave boy, Oliver.

312
00:35:12,342 --> 00:35:14,351
Did you see any
of those pretty things, my dear?

313
00:35:14,551 --> 00:35:16,177
Yes, sir.

314
00:35:16,632 --> 00:35:18,158
They....

315
00:35:18,743 --> 00:35:21,493
They're mine, Oliver.
My little property.

316
00:35:21,687 --> 00:35:23,826
For my old age.

317
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,159
It's our secret.

318
00:35:26,647 --> 00:35:29,233
-You understand, my dear?
-Yes, sir.

319
00:35:30,263 --> 00:35:31,920
Can I go up now, sir?

320
00:35:35,798 --> 00:35:36,944
Now....

321
00:36:15,796 --> 00:36:17,967
I hope you've been at work
this morning, my dears.

322
00:36:18,163 --> 00:36:19,308
-Hard.
-As nails.

323
00:36:19,508 --> 00:36:20,817
Good boys.

324
00:36:21,011 --> 00:36:22,419
Good boys.

325
00:36:22,612 --> 00:36:25,033
-What you got, Dodger?
-Couple of pocketbooks.

326
00:36:25,235 --> 00:36:27,340
-Lined?
-Pretty well.

327
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:32,200
Yeah.

328
00:36:40,562 --> 00:36:42,417
Dodge.

329
00:36:42,834 --> 00:36:44,973
I don't know, Dodge.

330
00:36:48,307 --> 00:36:49,681
Well...

331
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,078
...not as heavy as they might be...

332
00:36:52,273 --> 00:36:53,615
...but very neat...

333
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:56,396
...and nicely made.

334
00:36:56,595 --> 00:36:59,115
Ingenious workman,
ain't he, Oliver?

335
00:36:59,314 --> 00:37:00,940
Indeed, sir.

336
00:37:01,138 --> 00:37:03,407
And, Charley, what have you got,
my dear?

337
00:37:03,601 --> 00:37:05,543
-Wipes.
-Wipes?

338
00:37:09,745 --> 00:37:12,167
They're very good ones.

339
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:14,126
Very.

340
00:37:18,673 --> 00:37:20,199
You haven't marked them well.

341
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:25,127
The marks should be picked out
with a needle. And we'll--

342
00:37:25,328 --> 00:37:26,888
We'll teach Oliver how to do it.

343
00:37:27,088 --> 00:37:28,876
-Shall us, Oliver?
-lf you please, sir.

344
00:37:29,072 --> 00:37:32,552
You'd like to make handkerchiefs as
easy as Charley Bates, wouldn't you?

345
00:37:32,753 --> 00:37:35,207
Very much indeed,
if you'll teach me, sir.

346
00:37:35,408 --> 00:37:38,255
I've never met anyone so green.

347
00:37:54,703 --> 00:37:56,427
Now then, boys...

348
00:37:56,623 --> 00:37:58,280
...the game.

349
00:37:59,918 --> 00:38:01,957
We'll show Oliver...

350
00:38:02,158 --> 00:38:04,012
...how to make
pocket handkerchiefs.

351
00:38:06,318 --> 00:38:08,205
You'd like to play a game,
wouldn't you?

352
00:38:08,397 --> 00:38:10,056
Yes, sir.

353
00:39:32,553 --> 00:39:35,400
-Got the time, guv?
-It's...

354
00:39:35,593 --> 00:39:37,764
...8:00.

355
00:39:46,024 --> 00:39:50,082
-Playing the game, were we, Fagin?
-As is our custom, my dear.

356
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:53,595
-He's new. Who's he?
-Oh, this is Oliver.

357
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,293
Oliver...

358
00:39:56,008 --> 00:40:00,066
...these are our very good friends
Bet and Nancy.

359
00:40:02,471 --> 00:40:04,544
See, Dodger,
you wanna learn from him.

360
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,684
He's got manners, he has.
A proper gentleman.

361
00:40:08,073 --> 00:40:10,046
We popped in
because we were that cold inside.

362
00:40:10,248 --> 00:40:13,663
As is your custom, my dear.

363
00:40:13,927 --> 00:40:16,578
-Charley.
-Come on, Oliver. Join us.

364
00:40:16,775 --> 00:40:18,914
Or don't you sit
with the common folk?

365
00:40:19,814 --> 00:40:22,498
Now, you wanna be
careful of this lot, Oliver.

366
00:40:22,694 --> 00:40:25,115
-They'll have you picking--
-Picking out the marks.

367
00:40:25,318 --> 00:40:28,482
Just what we was teaching him,
ain't it, Oliver, my dear?

368
00:40:28,678 --> 00:40:30,369
-Yes, sir.
-"Yes, sir"?

369
00:40:30,566 --> 00:40:33,250
You know who you're talking to,
do you?

370
00:40:33,959 --> 00:40:36,260
What's your mother got to say
about you being here?

371
00:40:36,454 --> 00:40:38,787
I haven't got a mother.
I'm an orphan.

372
00:40:38,982 --> 00:40:40,410
You're in the right company, then.

373
00:40:43,781 --> 00:40:45,603
Come on, Oliver,
I'll teach you how to play.

374
00:40:45,796 --> 00:40:47,804
It's called Spec or Speculation.

375
00:40:48,004 --> 00:40:51,387
Three cards each,
and then the one he turns up...

376
00:40:51,589 --> 00:40:53,477
...is trumps.

377
00:41:01,637 --> 00:41:05,084
This is a pleasant life,
ain't it, my dear?

378
00:41:08,547 --> 00:41:12,988
-When can I go out, sir?
-Soon. Soon.

379
00:41:14,307 --> 00:41:15,900
Let's--

380
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:18,520
Let's see what you've learned.

381
00:41:18,947 --> 00:41:21,914
-Would you like that?
-Oh, yes, sir.

382
00:41:22,818 --> 00:41:25,535
See if you can take this out...

383
00:41:26,178 --> 00:41:28,699
...without my feeling it.

384
00:41:54,305 --> 00:41:56,093
Is it gone?

385
00:41:57,984 --> 00:42:00,832
You're a clever boy, my dear.

386
00:42:01,025 --> 00:42:04,025
I never saw a sharper lad.

387
00:42:09,152 --> 00:42:10,908
Here's a shilling for you.

388
00:42:12,543 --> 00:42:15,129
Make the Dodger and Charley
your models.

389
00:42:15,328 --> 00:42:16,789
Especially the Dodger, my dear.

390
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:20,340
He'll be a great man himself,
make you one too.

391
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:22,169
You go on this way...

392
00:42:22,368 --> 00:42:25,085
...you'll be the greatest man
of the time.

393
00:42:27,615 --> 00:42:30,036
Thank you very much, sir.

394
00:42:37,502 --> 00:42:41,015
Lovely white apples.
Get your lovely apples.

395
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:46,966
Biggest cabbages in town.
Come on.

396
00:42:48,638 --> 00:42:50,973
You mean that one
with the wide rim?

397
00:42:51,838 --> 00:42:53,495
Too expensive.

398
00:43:40,987 --> 00:43:43,027
Thief! Your handkerchief, sir.

399
00:43:43,226 --> 00:43:44,471
Stop, thief!

400
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:49,812
Stop!

401
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:51,571
Thief!

402
00:43:52,571 --> 00:43:54,457
-You're a thief!
-Get him!

403
00:43:55,227 --> 00:43:57,049
-Stop him!
-Stop that boy!

404
00:43:57,242 --> 00:43:58,803
Thief!

405
00:44:00,761 --> 00:44:02,550
Stop, thief!

406
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:04,472
Thief!

407
00:44:06,777 --> 00:44:08,370
Stop him!

408
00:44:09,625 --> 00:44:10,835
Stop him!

409
00:44:11,161 --> 00:44:13,015
Mind out.

410
00:44:16,057 --> 00:44:18,032
Stop, thief!

411
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,615
There, over there.

412
00:44:24,216 --> 00:44:25,842
That way!

413
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,822
-Stop, thief! Stop!
-Thief!

414
00:44:44,375 --> 00:44:46,644
-What's your name, boy?
-Give him some air.

415
00:44:47,447 --> 00:44:48,723
He's scared to death.

416
00:44:48,919 --> 00:44:51,985
-Where's the gentleman?
-Here's the gentleman now.

417
00:44:52,183 --> 00:44:54,125
-ls this the boy, sir?
-Yes, I'm afraid it is.

418
00:44:54,326 --> 00:44:56,748
That's a good one.
Did you hear him, "afraid it is"?

419
00:44:56,951 --> 00:45:00,115
-Poor fellow's hurt himself.
-Yeah, I did that, sir.

420
00:45:00,311 --> 00:45:03,890
Hurt me knuckle against his mouth.
But I stopped him.

421
00:45:04,087 --> 00:45:06,902
-Get up!
-lt wasn't me, sir. It wasn't me.

422
00:45:07,094 --> 00:45:09,428
Of course it wasn't. It never is.

423
00:45:09,622 --> 00:45:11,215
-Now get up.
-Don't hurt him.

424
00:45:11,414 --> 00:45:14,545
Oh, no, sir, I won't hurt him.

425
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:18,550
This way, gentlemen.

426
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:20,076
This way, gentlemen.

427
00:45:22,004 --> 00:45:24,875
-What's next?
-That is my name and address, sir.

428
00:45:25,077 --> 00:45:27,444
Officer, who is this fellow?

429
00:45:27,638 --> 00:45:29,460
-My name is Brownlow.
-Hold your tongue.

430
00:45:29,653 --> 00:45:31,955
Officer, what's this fellow
charged with?

431
00:45:32,148 --> 00:45:34,188
Oh, no, no. He's not charged,
Your Worship.

432
00:45:34,388 --> 00:45:36,112
He appears against the boy.

433
00:45:36,308 --> 00:45:37,835
-Swear him.
-Before I am sworn...

434
00:45:38,036 --> 00:45:40,491
-...I must beg to say one word.
-Hold your tongue, sir.

435
00:45:40,691 --> 00:45:43,560
-I will not, sir!
-Hold your tongue this instant.

436
00:45:43,763 --> 00:45:46,034
You're an insolent,
impertinent fellow.

437
00:45:46,229 --> 00:45:48,399
-How dare you bully a magistrate.
-What?

438
00:45:48,596 --> 00:45:51,944
Swear this person.
I'll not hear another word. Swear him.

439
00:45:52,148 --> 00:45:55,377
"l do solemnly swear to tell
the whole truth, so help me God."

440
00:45:55,571 --> 00:45:58,288
-What's the charge against the boy?
-I was at a bookstore when--

441
00:45:58,483 --> 00:46:00,425
Hold your tongue!
Where's the policeman?

442
00:46:00,627 --> 00:46:02,798
Policeman, what is this?
Are there any witnesses?

443
00:46:02,994 --> 00:46:05,198
-None, Your Worship.
-The boy is ill.

444
00:46:05,393 --> 00:46:07,882
Oh, yes, I daresay.

445
00:46:08,082 --> 00:46:11,050
Come along, you vagabond.
None of your tricks here.

446
00:46:11,251 --> 00:46:12,909
What's your name?

447
00:46:13,554 --> 00:46:16,009
What's your name,
you hardened scoundrel?

448
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:19,177
-Officer, what's his name?
-What's your name, boy?

449
00:46:19,729 --> 00:46:21,999
Some water. Some water.

450
00:46:22,194 --> 00:46:24,398
He says his name is Sam Waters,
Your Worship.

451
00:46:24,593 --> 00:46:26,219
-Where does he live?
-Where do you live?

452
00:46:26,418 --> 00:46:29,581
-Anywhere he can, Your Worship.
-Stuff and nonsense.

453
00:46:29,777 --> 00:46:31,273
Don't try to make a fool out of me.

454
00:46:31,474 --> 00:46:33,384
No, I think he really is ill,
Your Worship.

455
00:46:33,586 --> 00:46:36,335
I know better,
or my name's not Fang.

456
00:46:36,530 --> 00:46:38,569
Stand away, officer. He's shamming.

457
00:46:39,601 --> 00:46:41,095
He stands committed
for three months.

458
00:46:41,297 --> 00:46:43,086
Hard labor, of course.
Clear the office.

459
00:46:43,281 --> 00:46:45,485
Stop. Stop, stop!
Don't take him away.

460
00:46:45,681 --> 00:46:48,462
What is this? Who is this?
Turn this man out.

461
00:46:48,656 --> 00:46:52,682
-Clear the office.
-I will not be turned out! I will speak!

462
00:46:52,882 --> 00:46:54,856
I saw it all. I own the bookshop.

463
00:46:55,409 --> 00:46:57,645
-I demand to be heard.
-What have you got to say?

464
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:00,654
-lt was not this boy.
-Not this boy? Who was it, then?

465
00:47:00,848 --> 00:47:03,717
The robbery was committed by
two others while the man was reading.

466
00:47:03,919 --> 00:47:07,050
I saw it done. I saw that this boy
was perfectly amazed by it.

467
00:47:07,247 --> 00:47:08,491
Why didn't you come before?

468
00:47:09,102 --> 00:47:12,069
-I hadn't a soul to mind the shop.
-Reading, you say?

469
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:13,798
A book, I suppose.

470
00:47:14,255 --> 00:47:15,914
Yes, the very one
he has in his hand.

471
00:47:16,975 --> 00:47:18,798
Oh, dear me, I forgot all about it.

472
00:47:18,991 --> 00:47:20,452
Well, you're a nice one.

473
00:47:20,655 --> 00:47:24,070
To prefer a charge
against an innocent boy.

474
00:47:24,494 --> 00:47:27,178
I consider, sir,
that you've obtained that book...

475
00:47:27,374 --> 00:47:30,243
...under very suspicious
and disreputable circumstances.

476
00:47:30,446 --> 00:47:31,590
-Damn me!
-Bookseller...

477
00:47:31,789 --> 00:47:33,676
...do you want to press charges
against him?

478
00:47:33,869 --> 00:47:35,243
-Certainly not.
-Well...

479
00:47:36,397 --> 00:47:37,772
...think yourself fortunate...

480
00:47:37,965 --> 00:47:40,170
...that the owner of the book
declines to prosecute.

481
00:47:40,462 --> 00:47:41,574
The boy is discharged.

482
00:47:41,773 --> 00:47:42,918
-Clear the office.
-Damn me.

483
00:47:43,117 --> 00:47:45,354
Clear the office!
Clear the office!

484
00:47:45,549 --> 00:47:47,459
Next case.

485
00:47:48,076 --> 00:47:51,425
Come on. Move along, sir, please.
Just move along, sir.

486
00:47:51,629 --> 00:47:53,090
There's a good gentleman, sir.

487
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:55,747
Hold on, Harry. I'll give you a hand.

488
00:47:55,948 --> 00:47:58,698
Mind that step.
Just mind that step there.

489
00:48:00,109 --> 00:48:02,248
Make way for the law, sir.

490
00:48:03,277 --> 00:48:06,691
-Careful. Careful with him.
-He seems very young too.

491
00:48:08,172 --> 00:48:09,382
Call a coach, pray.

492
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:12,427
-Yeah, right away, sir.
-I'm sorry.

493
00:48:13,868 --> 00:48:15,690
Poor boy.

494
00:48:20,043 --> 00:48:22,596
-Mind yourself, madam.
-Thank you, sir.

495
00:48:23,116 --> 00:48:25,417
-Got one, sir.
-Thank you, officer.

496
00:48:26,027 --> 00:48:27,521
Let me, sir.

497
00:48:27,723 --> 00:48:29,348
There we go.

498
00:48:31,562 --> 00:48:33,667
-Will you drop me off, sir?
-Of course.

499
00:48:34,730 --> 00:48:35,876
All right.

500
00:48:36,074 --> 00:48:38,463
If you could just take his head, sir.

501
00:48:39,626 --> 00:48:42,375
-Where to, sir?
-Pentonville.

502
00:48:42,570 --> 00:48:44,196
-Pentonville.
-Yes.

503
00:48:45,578 --> 00:48:46,122
Answer me! Where is he?

504
00:48:46,122 --> 00:48:46,721
Answer me! Where is he?

505
00:48:46,921 --> 00:48:49,343
What's become of the boy?
Speak out, or I'll throttle you!

506
00:48:49,546 --> 00:48:52,447
The traps have got him!
Let go of me, will you?!

507
00:49:00,072 --> 00:49:01,217
Bullseye!

508
00:49:01,416 --> 00:49:04,678
Who pitched this here at me?
Who done it?

509
00:49:06,568 --> 00:49:09,952
Bullseye.
Come in, you sneaking warmint.

510
00:49:10,153 --> 00:49:12,705
What you stopping outside for?

511
00:49:13,704 --> 00:49:15,329
Lay down.

512
00:49:17,224 --> 00:49:20,606
What you up to, Fagin?
Ill-treating the boys again?

513
00:49:20,935 --> 00:49:24,547
A wonder they don't murder you.
I would, if I was them.

514
00:49:24,743 --> 00:49:28,321
Don't speak so loud.
You seem out of sorts, Bill.

515
00:49:28,519 --> 00:49:30,941
Give us a drink.
And mind you don't poison it.

516
00:49:31,143 --> 00:49:32,801
Charley.

517
00:49:33,287 --> 00:49:35,295
Good stuff, Bill.

518
00:49:36,744 --> 00:49:38,085
So, Dodger...

519
00:49:38,279 --> 00:49:40,963
-...what's it all about?
-A new boy.

520
00:49:41,159 --> 00:49:43,166
Come out with us
afore he was rightly up to it.

521
00:49:43,527 --> 00:49:46,657
-Got nabbed by the traps.
-You see, Bill...

522
00:49:46,855 --> 00:49:51,676
...I'm afraid he may say something
which will get us into trouble.

523
00:49:52,198 --> 00:49:54,915
You were blowed upon, Fagin.

524
00:49:55,111 --> 00:49:56,256
And about time.

525
00:49:56,454 --> 00:49:59,269
And I'm afraid, you see, Bill,
that if the game was up with us...

526
00:49:59,463 --> 00:50:03,902
...it would come out rather worse
for you than it would for me, my dear.

527
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:05,953
There's only one thing for it.

528
00:50:06,149 --> 00:50:09,410
Somebody's gotta find out at the office
what's being done to him.

529
00:50:09,605 --> 00:50:11,492
Somebody's gotta
get hold of him somehow.

530
00:50:11,685 --> 00:50:14,719
I ain't going near no police office.
Not for nobody, nohow.

531
00:50:15,044 --> 00:50:17,795
I have it, the very thing.
Bet will go.

532
00:50:17,989 --> 00:50:20,444
-Won't you, my dear?
-I'm blessed if I will.

533
00:50:20,644 --> 00:50:22,335
Nancy, my dear, what do you say?

534
00:50:22,532 --> 00:50:25,467
It won't do. There's no use
in trying it on, Fagin.

535
00:50:25,668 --> 00:50:27,359
-What do you mean by that?
-What I say.

536
00:50:27,556 --> 00:50:29,378
Why, you're just
the very person for it.

537
00:50:29,572 --> 00:50:31,328
Nobody about here
knows anything about you.

538
00:50:31,524 --> 00:50:34,011
And as I don't want them to neither.

539
00:50:34,212 --> 00:50:36,317
It's rather more "no" than "yes"
with me, Bill.

540
00:50:36,515 --> 00:50:38,490
-She'll go, Fagin.
-No, she won't, Fagin.

541
00:50:38,692 --> 00:50:40,601
Yes, she will, Fagin.

542
00:50:51,043 --> 00:50:54,304
-Can I help you, miss?
-I'm looking for my little brother.

543
00:50:54,978 --> 00:50:57,399
-Now, who would he be?
-A lovely little boy.

544
00:50:57,601 --> 00:51:00,701
Lovely manners.
Gentle as falling snow.

545
00:51:01,666 --> 00:51:03,454
We don't get many of those.

546
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:06,170
I think you'll be wanting
Mr. Fang's court.

547
00:51:12,354 --> 00:51:15,453
George, this here young lady
is looking for her brother.

548
00:51:15,650 --> 00:51:17,592
The one that fainted
and got away with it.

549
00:51:17,793 --> 00:51:19,997
Oh, yeah.
Gentleman took him away.

550
00:51:20,193 --> 00:51:23,194
What gentleman? Gracious heavens,
what gentleman?

551
00:51:23,393 --> 00:51:25,881
Well, lives in Pentonville, I believe.

552
00:51:26,081 --> 00:51:28,285
Oh, my God.

553
00:51:28,801 --> 00:51:30,775
No, no. Wait, wait, wait.

554
00:51:30,977 --> 00:51:33,278
His card's here somewhere.

555
00:51:34,017 --> 00:51:35,674
Here we are.

556
00:51:42,272 --> 00:51:44,312
Thank you, sir.

557
00:52:41,436 --> 00:52:43,096
Mr. Brownlow.

558
00:52:43,293 --> 00:52:45,300
Mr. Brownlow.

559
00:53:12,027 --> 00:53:13,619
There's something in him...

560
00:53:13,819 --> 00:53:16,601
...that touched my heart,
Mrs. Bedwin.

561
00:53:16,795 --> 00:53:18,737
Can't explain it.

562
00:53:18,938 --> 00:53:21,589
I feel the same, sir.

563
00:53:21,786 --> 00:53:23,728
Who is he? What is he?

564
00:53:23,930 --> 00:53:25,621
You know nothing of him.

565
00:53:25,818 --> 00:53:27,857
He had a fever. What of that?

566
00:53:28,282 --> 00:53:30,670
Bad people have fevers sometimes.

567
00:53:30,873 --> 00:53:33,557
I knew a man in Jamaica who was
hanged for murdering his master.

568
00:53:33,753 --> 00:53:35,858
He had a fever six times.

569
00:53:36,185 --> 00:53:39,088
-I know there is goodness in him.
-How do you know it?

570
00:53:39,290 --> 00:53:40,752
Goodness and innocence.

571
00:53:41,241 --> 00:53:43,662
-I knew it the first moment I saw him.
-He'll deceive you.

572
00:53:43,865 --> 00:53:45,719
Let you down
at the first opportunity...

573
00:53:45,914 --> 00:53:48,466
...Iike all your other
good and innocent causes.

574
00:53:48,664 --> 00:53:53,007
If that boy's good and innocent,
I'll eat my own head, sir.

575
00:54:01,496 --> 00:54:03,635
How do you feel, my dear?

576
00:54:03,832 --> 00:54:05,458
Very happy, sir.

577
00:54:05,656 --> 00:54:09,453
-And very grateful to you indeed, sir.
-Good boy.

578
00:54:10,455 --> 00:54:14,001
Have you given him any nourishment,
Bedwin? Any slops?

579
00:54:14,199 --> 00:54:16,981
Not slops, sir. Broth.

580
00:54:17,590 --> 00:54:19,053
A couple of glasses of port wine...

581
00:54:19,255 --> 00:54:21,710
...would have done him
a great deal more good.

582
00:54:21,911 --> 00:54:23,887
Wouldn't they, Sam?

583
00:54:24,088 --> 00:54:25,975
My name is Oliver, sir.

584
00:54:26,168 --> 00:54:27,923
Oliver?

585
00:54:28,407 --> 00:54:31,984
-Oliver what? Oliver Waters?
-No, sir. Twist. Oliver Twist.

586
00:54:33,271 --> 00:54:35,474
Why did you tell the magistrate
your name was Waters?

587
00:54:35,671 --> 00:54:37,459
I never told him so, sir.

588
00:54:38,326 --> 00:54:41,140
-You did not?
-No, sir.

589
00:54:43,798 --> 00:54:46,416
-You're not angry with me, are you?
-No, no.

590
00:54:47,509 --> 00:54:49,004
Queer name.

591
00:54:49,206 --> 00:54:50,383
Oliver Twist.

592
00:54:52,565 --> 00:54:55,499
There are a great many books,
are there not, my boy?

593
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:57,805
A great number, sir.

594
00:54:58,005 --> 00:55:00,144
Never saw so many.

595
00:55:02,484 --> 00:55:04,655
How would you like
to grow up a clever man...

596
00:55:04,852 --> 00:55:06,739
...and write books?

597
00:55:06,932 --> 00:55:09,354
I think I'd rather read them, sir.

598
00:55:09,557 --> 00:55:12,174
Wouldn't you like to be
a book writer?

599
00:55:13,332 --> 00:55:16,747
I think it'd be a better thing
to be a bookseller, sir.

600
00:55:18,739 --> 00:55:22,088
You have said a very good thing.

601
00:55:22,482 --> 00:55:23,693
Well, well.

602
00:55:23,891 --> 00:55:27,152
We won't make an author of you while
there's an honest trade to be learned...

603
00:55:27,346 --> 00:55:29,419
...or brickmaking to turn to.

604
00:55:29,618 --> 00:55:32,782
-Are you going to send me away, sir?
-No, my dear child.

605
00:55:32,979 --> 00:55:35,596
You need not be afraid
that I am going to desert you...

606
00:55:35,795 --> 00:55:38,162
-...unless you give me cause.
-I never, never will, sir.

607
00:55:38,354 --> 00:55:39,499
I hope not...

608
00:55:39,698 --> 00:55:42,447
...because I feel strongly disposed
to trust you.

609
00:55:42,642 --> 00:55:43,852
Thank you, sir.

610
00:55:52,978 --> 00:55:55,051
I'm pleased
I won't have to wear those again.

611
00:55:55,251 --> 00:55:56,909
So are we all, my dear.

612
00:55:59,249 --> 00:56:00,908
There.

613
00:56:55,406 --> 00:56:57,161
Hello.

614
00:56:57,358 --> 00:56:58,950
What's that?

615
00:56:59,149 --> 00:57:00,939
This is young Oliver Twist.

616
00:57:01,134 --> 00:57:02,727
The bookseller's boy
brought a package.

617
00:57:02,926 --> 00:57:06,274
Oh, stop him, Oliver.
There's some books to go back.

618
00:57:06,477 --> 00:57:09,444
-ls that the boy who had the fever?
-That's the boy.

619
00:57:24,269 --> 00:57:26,124
Mind out!

620
00:57:35,693 --> 00:57:39,238
-No sign of him, sir.
-Oh, dear, I'm very sorry for that.

621
00:57:39,435 --> 00:57:41,770
I particularly wished some books
to be returned tonight.

622
00:57:41,963 --> 00:57:45,508
Why not send Oliver with them?
He'll be sure to deliver them safely.

623
00:57:45,707 --> 00:57:47,082
Yes, do let me take them.

624
00:57:47,276 --> 00:57:50,275
If you please, sir.
I'll run all the way.

625
00:57:58,475 --> 00:57:59,881
You shall go, my dear.

626
00:58:00,074 --> 00:58:02,016
Ask Mrs. Bedwin
to show you the way.

627
00:58:03,211 --> 00:58:05,698
-And, Oliver....
-Yes, sir?

628
00:58:05,898 --> 00:58:08,616
Give the bookseller this.

629
00:58:11,915 --> 00:58:13,889
The money I owe him.

630
00:58:20,169 --> 00:58:21,860
I won't be long, sir.

631
00:58:23,433 --> 00:58:27,230
-How long do you think it'll take him?
-You really expect him to come back?

632
00:58:28,903 --> 00:58:31,490
-You don't?
-With a ¡ê5 note in his pocket?

633
00:58:31,689 --> 00:58:33,282
No, I do not.

634
00:58:34,345 --> 00:58:36,417
If ever that boy
returns to this house...

635
00:58:36,617 --> 00:58:38,559
...I'll eat my own head, sir.

636
00:58:39,944 --> 00:58:41,089
And yours.

637
00:58:57,383 --> 00:58:59,238
Oh, my little brother!

638
00:58:59,815 --> 00:59:02,368
-I don't believe my eyes.
-Let me go. Help!

639
00:59:02,567 --> 00:59:06,277
-It's a miracle. Oh, I've found him.
-Please let me go.

640
00:59:06,471 --> 00:59:09,122
-Oh, Oliver. Oliver.
-Nancy.

641
00:59:09,319 --> 00:59:12,515
You're such a naughty boy to make me
suffer such distress on your account.

642
00:59:12,710 --> 00:59:14,717
-Let go of me!
-What's the matter, ma'am?

643
00:59:14,918 --> 00:59:16,578
He ran away from his parents.

644
00:59:16,775 --> 00:59:18,946
-Get off me!
-Hard-working, respectable people...

645
00:59:19,142 --> 00:59:21,598
...and joined a set of thieves
and bad characters.

646
00:59:21,798 --> 00:59:23,042
Broke his mother's heart.

647
00:59:23,238 --> 00:59:25,605
Young wretch.
Go home, you little brute.

648
00:59:25,798 --> 00:59:27,204
I haven't got any parents.

649
00:59:27,398 --> 00:59:29,089
I'm an orphan.
I live in Pentonville.

650
00:59:29,285 --> 00:59:31,390
Oh, only hear him,
how he braves it out.

651
00:59:31,589 --> 00:59:33,728
-What? Young Oliver.
-It's true.

652
00:59:35,652 --> 00:59:37,562
You come home
to your poor mother.

653
00:59:37,764 --> 00:59:40,699
I don't belong to them!
I don't know them! Help! Help!

654
00:59:40,901 --> 00:59:42,045
"Help, help"?

655
00:59:42,246 --> 00:59:45,377
I'll give you "help, help,"
you little wretch!

656
00:59:45,573 --> 00:59:47,067
And these books.

657
00:59:47,269 --> 00:59:49,853
Have you been a-stealing them,
have you, eh?

658
00:59:50,052 --> 00:59:53,346
-You little villain.
-That's right. You give it to him.

659
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:56,638
-Only way to bring him to his senses.
-I will, missus.

660
00:59:56,836 --> 00:59:58,526
And you come with me,
you little wretch.

661
00:59:58,724 --> 01:00:00,349
It'll do him good.

662
01:00:00,546 --> 01:00:02,915
-Who is this man? Help!
-Bullseye, mind him, boy.

663
01:00:03,108 --> 01:00:05,474
-Mind him.
-Help! Help!

664
01:00:07,395 --> 01:00:08,769
Look at him, Fagin.

665
01:00:08,964 --> 01:00:11,068
Hold me, somebody.

666
01:00:11,267 --> 01:00:13,721
Hold me, somebody,
while I laugh it out.

667
01:00:13,922 --> 01:00:15,929
Look at his togs, Fagin.

668
01:00:16,131 --> 01:00:18,650
Delighted to see you
looking so well, my dear.

669
01:00:18,850 --> 01:00:21,370
Why didn't you write, my dear,
and say you was coming?

670
01:00:21,570 --> 01:00:24,570
We'd have got something warm
for supper.

671
01:00:24,770 --> 01:00:27,355
Hello, Fagin. What's that?
That's mine, Fagin.

672
01:00:27,554 --> 01:00:30,107
Oh, no, my dear. Mine, Bill, mine.
You shall have the books.

673
01:00:30,305 --> 01:00:32,858
If that ain't mine and Nancy's,
I'll take the boy back again.

674
01:00:33,057 --> 01:00:34,267
Come on, hand over, will you?

675
01:00:34,465 --> 01:00:36,504
This is hardly fair, Bill.
Hardly fair, Nancy.

676
01:00:36,706 --> 01:00:39,968
Fair or not fair,
hand over, I tell you.

677
01:00:40,161 --> 01:00:43,576
Give it here, you avaricious
old skeleton. Give it here!

678
01:00:43,777 --> 01:00:46,844
That's for our share of the trouble,
and not half enough neither.

679
01:00:47,266 --> 01:00:50,561
You may keep the books if you're fond
of reading. If you ain't, sell them.

680
01:00:50,849 --> 01:00:54,646
They're very pretty.
Beautiful writing, isn't it, Oliver?

681
01:00:54,849 --> 01:00:57,718
Send them back.
They belong to Mr. Brownlow.

682
01:00:57,921 --> 01:00:59,677
Send them back.
The books and the money.

683
01:01:00,385 --> 01:01:01,530
He'll think I stole them.

684
01:01:01,729 --> 01:01:03,452
-Please send them back.
-The boy's right.

685
01:01:03,649 --> 01:01:07,063
You're right, Oliver. You're right.
They will think you've stolen them.

686
01:01:08,415 --> 01:01:10,805
It couldn't have happened better
if we'd chosen our time.

687
01:01:11,008 --> 01:01:12,831
Help! Help! Police!

688
01:01:13,024 --> 01:01:15,228
Fetch the police! The police!

689
01:01:15,968 --> 01:01:18,389
Keep back the dog, Bill.
He'll tear the boy to pieces.

690
01:01:18,591 --> 01:01:21,374
-Serve him right.
-Help! Fetch the police!

691
01:01:22,335 --> 01:01:23,480
Fetch the police!

692
01:01:23,679 --> 01:01:25,882
Step aside, or I'll split
your head against the wall.

693
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:27,127
I don't care.

694
01:01:27,327 --> 01:01:30,675
That child shan't be torn down
by the dog unless you kill me first.

695
01:01:32,511 --> 01:01:35,227
Bullseye. Here. Bullseye!

696
01:01:42,078 --> 01:01:43,900
Dodger!

697
01:01:44,413 --> 01:01:46,617
Get after him!

698
01:01:49,405 --> 01:01:52,405
Take your hands off me!

699
01:02:22,268 --> 01:02:25,050
So you wanted to get away,
my dear, did you?

700
01:02:25,244 --> 01:02:27,415
Wanted to call for the police,
did you?

701
01:02:27,612 --> 01:02:30,230
We'll soon cure you of that.

702
01:02:31,739 --> 01:02:34,489
I won't stand by
and see this done, Fagin.

703
01:02:34,683 --> 01:02:36,538
You got the boy.
What more do you want?

704
01:02:36,730 --> 01:02:39,666
Keep quiet, Nancy, or I'll quieten you
for a good long time to come.

705
01:02:39,867 --> 01:02:41,754
Let him be. Let him be!

706
01:02:41,947 --> 01:02:44,052
You're a fine one for the boy
to make a friend of.

707
01:02:44,250 --> 01:02:46,192
God Almighty help me, I am.

708
01:02:46,394 --> 01:02:49,690
He's a thief, a liar, a devil,
all that's bad from this night forth.

709
01:02:49,882 --> 01:02:52,271
Ain't that enough for the old wretch
without blows?

710
01:02:52,474 --> 01:02:55,256
Come, come, we must have
civil words. Civil words.

711
01:02:55,450 --> 01:02:58,613
Civil words?
Civil words, you old villain!

712
01:02:58,809 --> 01:03:01,527
I thieved for you when I was a child
not half as old as this.

713
01:03:01,722 --> 01:03:03,129
It's your living.

714
01:03:03,322 --> 01:03:06,388
Yes, and you're the wretch
that drove me to it...

715
01:03:06,585 --> 01:03:10,578
...and who will keep me at it,
day and night, till I die!

716
01:03:13,177 --> 01:03:16,788
Dodger, Charley,
put Oliver to bed.

717
01:03:16,984 --> 01:03:19,504
Best to take them clothes off.
They're too good to sleep in.

718
01:03:19,704 --> 01:03:22,999
Charley's right. This here suit cost
more than 4 pence ha'penny.

719
01:03:23,192 --> 01:03:26,324
I never felt such lovely stuff.
Have you, Dodger?

720
01:03:26,777 --> 01:03:28,564
Not me. But I'm willing to lay odds...

721
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:32,174
...this is the same stuff
the queen wears on Sundays.

722
01:03:34,583 --> 01:03:36,077
Quick, get him.

723
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:38,134
Take it off.

724
01:03:40,758 --> 01:03:41,903
Lift him up.

725
01:03:42,103 --> 01:03:44,273
Up he goes.

726
01:03:47,608 --> 01:03:48,752
Get them shoes off.

727
01:04:23,318 --> 01:04:25,586
Little something for your luncheon,
my dear?

728
01:04:42,067 --> 01:04:43,757
Shall we have a little chat?

729
01:04:44,819 --> 01:04:46,542
Oliver?

730
01:04:46,770 --> 01:04:48,461
Shall us?

731
01:04:50,994 --> 01:04:53,384
I expect you'd welcome...

732
01:04:53,586 --> 01:04:58,190
...the sound of a human voice again,
eh, my dear?

733
01:05:03,090 --> 01:05:04,813
Do you know...

734
01:05:05,330 --> 01:05:09,486
...what I consider the greatest sin
in the world, my dear?

735
01:05:10,417 --> 01:05:12,970
Ingratitude.

736
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:16,683
And that's what you're guilty of...

737
01:05:16,882 --> 01:05:18,856
...ingratitude.

738
01:05:19,090 --> 01:05:22,287
We took you in, we cherished you. If
we hadn't, you'd have died of hunger.

739
01:05:22,482 --> 01:05:24,075
How do you repay us?
You run away...

740
01:05:24,274 --> 01:05:29,391
...you cry out for the police, you
cause us great anxiety and expense.

741
01:05:33,490 --> 01:05:36,238
There was a lad once, just like you,
and I was a father to him.

742
01:05:36,433 --> 01:05:38,799
He ran away, like you.
He indeed went to the police.

743
01:05:38,994 --> 01:05:41,863
And can you guess
how he ended up?

744
01:05:44,561 --> 01:05:46,927
They hanged him...

745
01:05:47,121 --> 01:05:49,542
...at the Old Bailey.

746
01:05:50,192 --> 01:05:54,927
Certain evidence was made available,
not all of it precisely true...

747
01:05:55,759 --> 01:05:59,556
...but all of it necessary to provide
for my own safety...

748
01:05:59,759 --> 01:06:01,450
...and that of my friends.

749
01:06:01,647 --> 01:06:04,298
Yeah. Poor boy.

750
01:06:04,879 --> 01:06:06,766
Hanged.

751
01:06:07,344 --> 01:06:09,547
It's a terrible thing, hanging, Oliver.

752
01:06:09,743 --> 01:06:11,783
Dawn, the gallows...

753
01:06:11,983 --> 01:06:14,186
...the rope, the noose.

754
01:06:14,382 --> 01:06:16,586
You don't always have
to be guilty, you see, Oliver.

755
01:06:16,783 --> 01:06:18,375
They hang you for anything
these days.

756
01:06:18,574 --> 01:06:21,388
That's because they're
so very fond of hanging.

757
01:06:30,062 --> 01:06:32,811
But if you do as you're told...

758
01:06:33,325 --> 01:06:36,227
...we'll be very good friends yet.

759
01:06:44,972 --> 01:06:48,454
You must feel free
to walk about now, Oliver.

760
01:06:50,220 --> 01:06:51,650
Yes, feel free.

761
01:06:58,925 --> 01:07:01,706
-Here, Oliver.
-Yes?

762
01:07:02,220 --> 01:07:04,870
I'd like you to assist me
in my toilet straightaway.

763
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:09,730
-Will you do that for me, my man?
-All right. I'll be glad to have company.

764
01:07:09,932 --> 01:07:14,188
There's a good fellow. You may start
by japanning my trotter-cases.

765
01:07:14,380 --> 01:07:16,747
In plain English, clean my boots.

766
01:07:20,971 --> 01:07:22,825
What a pity he ain't a prig.

767
01:07:23,019 --> 01:07:25,320
He don't know what's good for him.

768
01:07:25,515 --> 01:07:27,139
I suppose you don't know
what a prig is.

769
01:07:27,338 --> 01:07:29,476
Yes, I do. It's a....

770
01:07:29,674 --> 01:07:32,195
It's a thief.

771
01:07:32,394 --> 01:07:33,824
You're one, aren't you?

772
01:07:34,027 --> 01:07:36,644
Yes, I am. And so we all are.
Down to the dog...

773
01:07:36,843 --> 01:07:38,533
...and he's the downiest one
of the lot.

774
01:07:38,730 --> 01:07:40,617
And the least given to peaching.

775
01:07:40,810 --> 01:07:42,752
He wouldn't so much as bark
in a witness box...

776
01:07:42,953 --> 01:07:47,525
-...for fear of committing himself.
-He's an out-and-out Christian, he is.

777
01:07:47,721 --> 01:07:50,142
Why don't you put yourself
under Fagin, Oliver?

778
01:07:50,345 --> 01:07:52,100
You'll make a fortune out of hand.

779
01:07:52,297 --> 01:07:55,974
Like your old gentleman
in Pentonville. Big house, that.

780
01:07:56,169 --> 01:07:59,267
I had a peep at it, I did.
Nice inside, was it?

781
01:07:59,465 --> 01:08:03,687
Yes. And I slept in a proper bed.
In my own room.

782
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:07,327
-Good stuff on the walls, eh?
-Yes. Indeed.

783
01:08:07,528 --> 01:08:08,935
Put yourself under Fagin...

784
01:08:09,128 --> 01:08:12,443
...and you'll be able to retire
to a property just like that.

785
01:08:12,647 --> 01:08:14,534
And do the genteel.

786
01:08:14,726 --> 01:08:16,702
No, he's scared
he'll come to be scragged.

787
01:08:16,903 --> 01:08:18,398
I don't know what that means.

788
01:08:22,695 --> 01:08:25,216
If you don't take pocket handkerchiefs
and watches, Nolly...

789
01:08:25,671 --> 01:08:28,606
...some other cove will. You have
the same right to them as they have.

790
01:08:28,807 --> 01:08:31,425
To be sure. To be sure.

791
01:08:31,624 --> 01:08:34,241
It all lies in a nutshell, my dear,
in a nutshell.

792
01:08:34,438 --> 01:08:35,683
Take the Dodger's word for it.

793
01:08:35,879 --> 01:08:38,694
He understands the catechism
of his trade.

794
01:08:49,702 --> 01:08:51,490
Cabby?

795
01:09:10,629 --> 01:09:13,498
-I've come from Bill.
-For what?

796
01:09:13,701 --> 01:09:17,049
-For no harm.
-I don't believe it.

797
01:09:18,180 --> 01:09:21,311
If I could help you, I would,
but I've not the power.

798
01:09:21,507 --> 01:09:24,257
Now, I've promised him
you'll be good and silent.

799
01:09:24,452 --> 01:09:27,267
If you're not, you'll only do
yourself harm.

800
01:09:27,460 --> 01:09:29,348
And me too.

801
01:09:38,595 --> 01:09:40,350
Did he come quiet?

802
01:09:40,547 --> 01:09:42,456
Like a lamb.

803
01:09:44,579 --> 01:09:46,334
Sit down.

804
01:09:50,882 --> 01:09:53,850
And let me read you a lecture.

805
01:09:59,904 --> 01:10:01,181
You know what this is?

806
01:10:02,049 --> 01:10:05,048
-Yes.
-Well, then.

807
01:10:08,673 --> 01:10:10,845
This is powder.

808
01:10:18,145 --> 01:10:19,289
That here's a bullet.

809
01:10:22,753 --> 01:10:25,884
And this is a little bit
of an old hat...

810
01:10:26,144 --> 01:10:28,054
...for wadding.

811
01:10:33,824 --> 01:10:38,363
-Now it's loaded.
-Yes, I can see it is, sir.

812
01:10:38,975 --> 01:10:41,278
If you speak a word
when you're out of doors with me...

813
01:10:41,472 --> 01:10:43,327
...unless I speak to you...

814
01:10:43,519 --> 01:10:46,585
...this loading will go in your head
without notice.

815
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:50,328
So if you do make up your mind
to speak without leave...

816
01:10:50,527 --> 01:10:52,054
...says your prayers first.

817
01:10:52,926 --> 01:10:55,961
The short and long of what you mean
is that if you're crossed by him...

818
01:10:56,159 --> 01:10:58,166
...you'll prevent him
from telling tales after...

819
01:10:58,366 --> 01:11:00,221
...by shooting him through the head.

820
01:11:00,414 --> 01:11:02,683
And you'll take your chance
of swinging for it.

821
01:11:02,879 --> 01:11:06,293
That's it. Women always put things
in the fewest words.

822
01:11:06,974 --> 01:11:08,500
Supper, Nancy.

823
01:11:08,701 --> 01:11:10,774
And then a snooze afore starting.

824
01:11:38,972 --> 01:11:40,980
My pal Bill.

825
01:11:41,180 --> 01:11:43,733
The door's open, come in.

826
01:11:45,756 --> 01:11:48,178
Don't make such a row.

827
01:11:51,388 --> 01:11:52,795
Show us a glim, Toby.

828
01:11:52,987 --> 01:11:56,085
Barney, a glim.
Show the gentleman in.

829
01:11:56,412 --> 01:12:00,852
Barney?
Wake up first, if convenient.

830
01:12:11,706 --> 01:12:14,357
Mr. Sykes. Come in, sir, come in.

831
01:12:32,345 --> 01:12:35,094
Bill, my boy. Glad to see you.

832
01:12:36,729 --> 01:12:38,584
Who's...?

833
01:12:38,777 --> 01:12:40,598
-Who's this?
-Only the boy.

834
01:12:40,793 --> 01:12:43,923
-One of Mr. Fagin's lads?
-Yeah. It's time.

835
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:45,745
Right.

836
01:12:47,033 --> 01:12:48,309
Barkers for me, Barney.

837
01:12:57,144 --> 01:12:59,631
-They're loaded.
-Good.

838
01:13:07,126 --> 01:13:10,029
-The persuaders?
-Got them.

839
01:13:14,007 --> 01:13:15,698
Keys, center bits.

840
01:13:19,928 --> 01:13:22,033
Darkies.

841
01:13:32,343 --> 01:13:34,198
Nothing forgotten?

842
01:13:44,597 --> 01:13:46,572
Yeah, it's all quiet.

843
01:14:34,865 --> 01:14:37,799
I can't. I can't.

844
01:14:38,130 --> 01:14:39,756
You will.

845
01:14:39,954 --> 01:14:41,329
It's Mr. Brownlow's house.

846
01:15:09,872 --> 01:15:11,595
Have mercy.
Don't make me steal from him.

847
01:15:11,792 --> 01:15:14,094
-Have mercy on me.
-Come here.

848
01:15:14,288 --> 01:15:16,557
For God's sake, let me run away
and die in the fields.

849
01:15:16,752 --> 01:15:19,980
-I'll never come near London, never.
-Shut it.

850
01:15:20,175 --> 01:15:23,971
Get up. Or I'll strew your brains
on the grass.

851
01:16:02,925 --> 01:16:04,997
I'm putting you through there.

852
01:16:05,196 --> 01:16:07,880
Go to the front door
and unfasten it.

853
01:16:08,523 --> 01:16:11,688
I can't, there's a bolt at the top.
I know it, I can't reach it.

854
01:16:11,885 --> 01:16:15,812
-Well, stand on a chair or something.
-Just do it.

855
01:17:09,993 --> 01:17:12,863
To the door.
To the front door, damn you.

856
01:17:15,145 --> 01:17:16,290
Who's there?

857
01:17:17,994 --> 01:17:20,360
Mrs. Bedwin? Is that you?

858
01:17:34,471 --> 01:17:35,998
Come here. Come here.

859
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:41,222
Save me! Save me!
Save me, for God's sake!

860
01:17:49,542 --> 01:17:51,070
Help!

861
01:17:52,647 --> 01:17:55,330
Help! Police!

862
01:18:04,231 --> 01:18:05,954
Give him here.

863
01:18:11,751 --> 01:18:13,540
Oh, damnation, how he bleeds.

864
01:18:13,734 --> 01:18:16,352
-ls he hit bad?
-He's gotta be hit worse.

865
01:18:22,117 --> 01:18:23,579
-Give me a pistol.
-What?

866
01:18:24,582 --> 01:18:26,971
We gotta get rid of him,
or he'll squeal.

867
01:18:27,173 --> 01:18:28,996
We gotta do him in.

868
01:18:29,349 --> 01:18:32,251
Here, here. Down here by the river.

869
01:18:32,453 --> 01:18:35,203
But, Bill! Bill!

870
01:18:37,989 --> 01:18:40,410
-Bill?
-Help!

871
01:18:40,612 --> 01:18:43,295
Help! Help!

872
01:18:44,133 --> 01:18:47,099
-Bill.
-Help!

873
01:18:54,916 --> 01:18:56,442
Snap.

874
01:18:57,955 --> 01:18:59,548
Snap.

875
01:19:01,059 --> 01:19:02,619
Snap.

876
01:19:05,314 --> 01:19:06,841
Snap.

877
01:19:09,314 --> 01:19:10,808
Snap.

878
01:19:24,033 --> 01:19:25,888
Well, well.

879
01:19:26,081 --> 01:19:27,575
How are you, Fagey?

880
01:19:29,408 --> 01:19:32,671
Scarce. Scarce!
Where's Bill?

881
01:19:32,866 --> 01:19:35,036
-He's-- He's bleeding.
-What happened?

882
01:19:35,233 --> 01:19:37,655
All in good time.

883
01:19:37,858 --> 01:19:41,435
I can't talk business
till I've ate and drank.

884
01:19:47,489 --> 01:19:50,489
Nancy, I said, scarce. Scarce!

885
01:19:50,688 --> 01:19:51,833
Where's Bill?

886
01:19:52,032 --> 01:19:54,007
Well, produce the sustenance,
if you please.

887
01:19:54,209 --> 01:19:55,998
Dodger!

888
01:19:56,192 --> 01:19:57,338
Nancy, scarce!

889
01:20:03,904 --> 01:20:06,325
-The crack failed.
-I smelt that.

890
01:20:06,528 --> 01:20:09,178
For the last time of asking,
where's Bill?

891
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:12,599
Dodger.

892
01:20:15,390 --> 01:20:18,293
Put him to bed,
give him a nip of gin.

893
01:20:24,927 --> 01:20:27,894
The boy was about to blow on us,
Fagey.

894
01:20:28,191 --> 01:20:30,263
-He was seen.
-Seen?

895
01:20:30,462 --> 01:20:32,982
He was seen? Who saw him?

896
01:20:33,310 --> 01:20:35,731
Two old ones.
He shouted out.

897
01:20:35,934 --> 01:20:38,038
Bill lost his head,
fired his pistol....

898
01:20:38,237 --> 01:20:40,605
-And hit the boy?
-I don't know. There was two shots.

899
01:20:40,798 --> 01:20:43,066
Only one was Bill's.

900
01:20:43,262 --> 01:20:46,577
We made a run for it.
I had ahold of the boy, and Bill fell.

901
01:20:46,782 --> 01:20:48,439
Fell? Was he hurt?

902
01:20:48,636 --> 01:20:51,932
No. Last seen, he was swimming
to London.

903
01:20:54,684 --> 01:20:56,572
Bullseye.

904
01:20:59,547 --> 01:21:01,751
I told you not to bring a soul here.

905
01:21:01,947 --> 01:21:03,890
Now you've brought the devil.

906
01:21:04,091 --> 01:21:06,361
You said to fetch him.

907
01:21:06,557 --> 01:21:09,206
His fever is that high,
he don't remember nothing.

908
01:21:09,404 --> 01:21:12,884
You're not well, are you, Bill?
How do you feel today?

909
01:21:13,084 --> 01:21:15,123
I'm as weak as water.

910
01:21:15,324 --> 01:21:16,917
Get us a drink.

911
01:21:18,395 --> 01:21:22,868
-What evil wind has blowed you here?
-No evil wind, my dear.

912
01:21:23,642 --> 01:21:26,840
You, Bill, you.
You said we need to speak.

913
01:21:32,251 --> 01:21:34,073
What you done with that boy?
Where is he?

914
01:21:34,267 --> 01:21:36,633
Safe and sound.
The Dodger's minding him.

915
01:21:36,826 --> 01:21:40,274
They're as close as Cain and Abel.

916
01:21:43,354 --> 01:21:45,742
What about the boy, Bill?

917
01:21:48,091 --> 01:21:50,644
We don't want anyone
peaching on us, do we?

918
01:21:50,842 --> 01:21:53,777
And as long as that boy's alive,
we're as good as hung.

919
01:21:54,009 --> 01:21:56,398
So, what's to be done?

920
01:21:58,233 --> 01:22:00,088
-Nothing.
-Nothing?

921
01:22:00,281 --> 01:22:03,215
-Not till I'm better.
-Then what?

922
01:22:04,025 --> 01:22:06,479
-Then I'll do for him.
-How, Bill? Where?

923
01:22:07,385 --> 01:22:10,255
Outside of London somewhere.
I'll find a river and I'll drown him.

924
01:22:10,457 --> 01:22:12,726
The boy's weak.
Bill, he was wounded.

925
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:15,255
He can hardly stand, let alone walk.

926
01:22:15,449 --> 01:22:18,350
When he can walk, tell me.
I'll fetch him.

927
01:22:19,704 --> 01:22:20,914
Now, get out of here.

928
01:22:21,624 --> 01:22:23,249
Yes.

929
01:22:24,216 --> 01:22:25,776
Yes.

930
01:22:26,007 --> 01:22:28,876
Bill, you're right.

931
01:22:32,566 --> 01:22:33,778
It's for the best.

932
01:22:38,103 --> 01:22:40,274
I'm burning up.

933
01:22:40,471 --> 01:22:41,997
Give me me physic.
Where's me physic?

934
01:22:44,278 --> 01:22:46,667
You look like a corpse
come back to life again.

935
01:22:46,870 --> 01:22:49,904
-What's the matter?
-Nothing.

936
01:22:50,998 --> 01:22:52,656
What do you look at me so hard for?

937
01:22:52,854 --> 01:22:55,889
-What you thinking of?
-Of many things, Bill.

938
01:22:56,087 --> 01:22:58,061
-What odds in that?
-I'll tell you what it is.

939
01:22:58,263 --> 01:22:59,954
If you haven't caught the fever...

940
01:23:00,150 --> 01:23:03,084
...then there's something
more than usual in the wind.

941
01:23:03,286 --> 01:23:05,708
And something dangerous too.

942
01:23:06,709 --> 01:23:09,229
Give me me physic, I say.

943
01:23:11,797 --> 01:23:14,666
No, no, no.

944
01:23:15,221 --> 01:23:18,385
There ain't a stauncher-hearted
girl going...

945
01:23:19,029 --> 01:23:22,029
...or I'd have cut her throat
three months ago.

946
01:23:23,541 --> 01:23:26,835
She's got a fever coming on.
That's it.

947
01:23:47,379 --> 01:23:50,346
Here. Make you feel better.

948
01:23:57,041 --> 01:23:59,081
Sit aside me.

949
01:24:01,458 --> 01:24:05,352
Put on your own face, or I'll alter it
so you won't know it again.

950
01:25:26,861 --> 01:25:28,999
-Wait.
-Ma'am.

951
01:25:46,219 --> 01:25:48,586
-Yes?
-Does Mr. Brownlow live here?

952
01:25:48,780 --> 01:25:51,780
Who are you? What do you want?
Go around the back.

953
01:25:51,979 --> 01:25:54,662
I have information
about Oliver Twist.

954
01:25:58,604 --> 01:26:00,776
Is he all right? Is he safe?

955
01:26:01,900 --> 01:26:05,413
-Where is he?
-I will only talk to Mr. Brownlow.

956
01:26:05,611 --> 01:26:08,000
He's not here.

957
01:26:08,715 --> 01:26:10,471
The boy's innocent, tell him that.

958
01:26:11,595 --> 01:26:14,344
-Where is he?
-Safe.

959
01:26:15,691 --> 01:26:18,920
-But he may not be for long.
-Where is he?

960
01:26:30,090 --> 01:26:31,616
Give Mr. Brownlow a message.

961
01:26:31,818 --> 01:26:34,022
Tell him to meet me on Sunday
at midnight...

962
01:26:34,217 --> 01:26:36,356
-...on London Bridge.
-Midnight?

963
01:26:36,553 --> 01:26:38,114
And if I'm not there...

964
01:26:38,313 --> 01:26:42,568
...then tell him to come the next night
and the next. I'll be there. Tell him.

965
01:26:48,008 --> 01:26:51,620
There, my dear,
you look as good as new.

966
01:26:52,104 --> 01:26:55,682
-How do you feel?
-Tired, sir.

967
01:26:55,880 --> 01:26:57,025
Well, yes, yes.

968
01:26:57,224 --> 01:27:00,573
It is long after midnight.
Shortly, you'll sleep a good sleep.

969
01:27:00,776 --> 01:27:02,150
But my meaning was...

970
01:27:02,343 --> 01:27:04,580
...how do you feel
in yourself, Oliver?

971
01:27:04,776 --> 01:27:06,947
Better. Thank you, sir.

972
01:27:07,144 --> 01:27:10,974
-But for the ache in my arm.
-Come sit.

973
01:27:13,351 --> 01:27:17,791
I have the very thing for such pains
as yours, my dear.

974
01:27:19,303 --> 01:27:20,513
Undo the bandage.

975
01:27:30,951 --> 01:27:33,471
Oh, my God.

976
01:27:34,119 --> 01:27:36,802
It's a nasty wound.

977
01:27:38,055 --> 01:27:41,599
But my magic will do the trick.
You'll see, my dear.

978
01:27:41,799 --> 01:27:43,838
This remedy...

979
01:27:44,038 --> 01:27:45,892
...is older than time. Yes...

980
01:27:46,086 --> 01:27:48,290
...my dear, older than time.

981
01:27:48,486 --> 01:27:51,802
It was handed down
from father to son...

982
01:27:52,007 --> 01:27:56,096
...father to son, and comes from...

983
01:27:58,117 --> 01:28:00,321
...who can say where?

984
01:28:03,140 --> 01:28:06,653
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

985
01:28:06,852 --> 01:28:08,892
For your kindness.
I'll always remember it.

986
01:28:09,091 --> 01:28:10,335
Well....

987
01:28:11,109 --> 01:28:12,483
Well....

988
01:28:13,637 --> 01:28:15,044
Always.

989
01:28:15,236 --> 01:28:17,723
Yes, always, my dear.

990
01:28:20,036 --> 01:28:22,938
But who knows how long
that will be.

991
01:28:50,241 --> 01:28:52,728
An hour this side of midnight.

992
01:28:52,961 --> 01:28:55,295
Dark and heavy it is too.

993
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:58,205
Good night for business, this.

994
01:28:58,401 --> 01:29:01,499
What a pity, Bill, my dear,
there's none quite ready to be done.

995
01:29:01,697 --> 01:29:03,290
Yeah, for once, you're right.

996
01:29:03,745 --> 01:29:06,080
When will the boy be well enough
to go on his travels?

997
01:29:06,274 --> 01:29:10,551
-Like I say, Bill. In a day or two.
-It's a pity.

998
01:29:10,753 --> 01:29:13,949
-For I'm in the humor to.
-Does me good to hear you.

999
01:29:14,144 --> 01:29:17,439
You're like yourself tonight, Bill.
Quite like yourself.

1000
01:29:17,633 --> 01:29:20,765
I don't feel like myself when you lay
that withered claw on my shoulder...

1001
01:29:20,961 --> 01:29:23,033
...so take it away.

1002
01:29:31,232 --> 01:29:33,087
Hello, Nance.

1003
01:29:33,279 --> 01:29:35,287
Where's the girl going to
this time of night?

1004
01:29:35,679 --> 01:29:38,046
-Not far.
-What answer's that?

1005
01:29:38,239 --> 01:29:40,858
-Where you going?
-I say, not far.

1006
01:29:41,055 --> 01:29:43,259
-And I say, where?
-I don't know where.

1007
01:29:43,456 --> 01:29:46,325
Then I do, nowhere. Sit down.

1008
01:29:46,527 --> 01:29:49,942
-I'm not well. I want a breath of air.
-Put your head out the window.

1009
01:29:50,142 --> 01:29:53,142
There's not enough there.
I want it in the street.

1010
01:29:56,670 --> 01:29:59,091
Then you won't have it.

1011
01:30:04,158 --> 01:30:08,435
There. Now, stop quietly
where you are, will you?

1012
01:30:13,533 --> 01:30:14,994
Do you know what you're doing?

1013
01:30:16,221 --> 01:30:18,162
Do I know what I'm--?

1014
01:30:18,365 --> 01:30:21,266
I think this girl's lost her senses.
You talking to me in that way?

1015
01:30:21,468 --> 01:30:23,410
You'll drive me on
to something desperate.

1016
01:30:23,612 --> 01:30:25,980
Now, let me go, will you?
This minute, this instant.

1017
01:30:26,172 --> 01:30:28,408
-No!
-Tell him to let me go, Fagin.

1018
01:30:29,052 --> 01:30:32,215
It'll be better for him.
Do you hear me?

1019
01:30:33,692 --> 01:30:36,658
Aye, I hear you.

1020
01:30:37,852 --> 01:30:40,634
And if I have to listen to you
for half a minute longer...

1021
01:30:40,827 --> 01:30:44,439
...the dog will tear some
of that screaming voice out!

1022
01:30:44,763 --> 01:30:47,446
What's come over you, you jade?
What is it?

1023
01:30:47,643 --> 01:30:49,433
Bill, let me go.

1024
01:30:49,948 --> 01:30:53,690
Let me go.
You don't know what you're doing.

1025
01:30:53,884 --> 01:30:55,061
For only one hour.

1026
01:30:55,259 --> 01:30:58,904
Cut my limbs off one by one if I don't
think the girl's stark raving mad.

1027
01:30:59,099 --> 01:31:02,677
-Get up. Get up!
-No.

1028
01:31:09,402 --> 01:31:10,547
Now, stay there!

1029
01:31:13,370 --> 01:31:14,963
What a precious, strange girl that is.

1030
01:31:15,163 --> 01:31:17,105
You may say that, Bill,
you may say that.

1031
01:31:17,306 --> 01:31:19,444
Why did she take it in her head
to go out tonight?

1032
01:31:19,929 --> 01:31:22,612
Obstinacy. Women's obstinacy,
I suppose, my dear.

1033
01:31:22,937 --> 01:31:25,970
I thought I tamed her of that.
But she's as bad as ever.

1034
01:31:28,473 --> 01:31:31,539
I think she's got a touch of my fever
in her blood and it won't come out.

1035
01:31:31,737 --> 01:31:33,165
Like enough.

1036
01:31:33,368 --> 01:31:36,238
Well, if she's taken that way again,
I'll let her a little blood.

1037
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:39,287
Without troubling the doctor.

1038
01:31:54,168 --> 01:31:56,851
Why, now she's on the other tack.

1039
01:31:58,167 --> 01:31:59,509
Good night.

1040
01:31:59,703 --> 01:32:04,012
In two days, Bill,
come for the boy.

1041
01:32:05,846 --> 01:32:07,853
Light him down.

1042
01:32:08,054 --> 01:32:11,699
It's a pity he should fall and break
his neck without anyone seeing it.

1043
01:32:13,750 --> 01:32:15,060
Show him a light.

1044
01:32:24,055 --> 01:32:27,599
What is it, Nancy dear,
the reason for all this?

1045
01:32:27,798 --> 01:32:29,936
-What do you mean?
-That matter just now.

1046
01:32:30,134 --> 01:32:32,075
We'll speak of this anon.

1047
01:32:32,278 --> 01:32:34,252
You have a friend in me, Nance.

1048
01:32:34,453 --> 01:32:36,558
A staunch friend.
You know me of old, Nance.

1049
01:32:37,076 --> 01:32:39,727
I know you well. Good night.

1050
01:32:44,949 --> 01:32:46,290
Dodge...

1051
01:32:46,484 --> 01:32:48,273
...pull it in.

1052
01:32:51,348 --> 01:32:54,283
My glass is full already,
can't you see?

1053
01:33:00,180 --> 01:33:01,837
Trouble?

1054
01:33:05,268 --> 01:33:06,990
Dodger.

1055
01:33:10,035 --> 01:33:12,621
-Let's find out where old Tom is, eh?
-He's in the Ten Bells.

1056
01:33:12,819 --> 01:33:15,208
Shall we both take him home?

1057
01:33:15,666 --> 01:33:17,040
Honestly...

1058
01:33:17,234 --> 01:33:19,754
...I haven't seen her.

1059
01:33:20,915 --> 01:33:22,573
Something up?

1060
01:33:24,882 --> 01:33:26,605
I....

1061
01:33:28,114 --> 01:33:33,710
I want you to do a piece of work for me
that requires great care and caution.

1062
01:33:34,002 --> 01:33:36,391
What is it?
I ain't going near no police office.

1063
01:33:36,593 --> 01:33:39,975
-That don't suit me, that don't.
-There's not the smallest danger in it.

1064
01:33:40,177 --> 01:33:43,143
Not the smallest.
I want someone dodged.

1065
01:33:43,345 --> 01:33:45,766
-Who, an old one?
-Young one.

1066
01:33:45,968 --> 01:33:47,178
-Who is she?
-One of us.

1067
01:33:47,377 --> 01:33:48,784
Who?

1068
01:33:48,977 --> 01:33:50,832
Nancy?

1069
01:33:52,273 --> 01:33:54,924
-What's she been up to?
-Not sure she's been up to anything...

1070
01:33:55,122 --> 01:33:58,285
...my dear, that's why
I want her dodged.

1071
01:34:00,209 --> 01:34:02,926
She may want to talk to people
she shouldn't want to talk to.

1072
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:07,877
I want to know where she goes,
who she sees, what she says.

1073
01:34:10,160 --> 01:34:11,851
Nancy.

1074
01:34:12,049 --> 01:34:14,569
I don't know. She's a good one,
is Nancy.

1075
01:34:14,768 --> 01:34:19,077
A pound, my dear.
One whole pound.

1076
01:34:57,710 --> 01:34:59,597
Mr. Brownlow?

1077
01:35:01,420 --> 01:35:03,046
Yes.

1078
01:35:06,124 --> 01:35:09,091
I'm afraid to speak to you here.
Come away. Follow me.

1079
01:35:23,052 --> 01:35:24,907
This is far enough.

1080
01:35:25,100 --> 01:35:27,969
-Why can't we speak up there?
-I told you, I'm afraid.

1081
01:35:28,172 --> 01:35:30,211
I may be followed.

1082
01:35:34,763 --> 01:35:36,039
I'm here because you told...

1083
01:35:36,234 --> 01:35:38,885
...my housekeeper you have
information concerning Oliver Twist.

1084
01:35:39,083 --> 01:35:41,189
-So I have.
-Tell me.

1085
01:35:42,795 --> 01:35:44,355
He's being held by the devil...

1086
01:35:44,555 --> 01:35:48,865
...and he's handing him over
to another what means to....

1087
01:35:49,067 --> 01:35:51,400
I must know more.
Is it someone close to you?

1088
01:35:52,394 --> 01:35:55,590
-One is. One ain't.
-These men, whoever they are...

1089
01:35:55,785 --> 01:35:58,241
-...must be delivered up by you.
-Never.

1090
01:35:58,442 --> 01:36:03,330
Bad a life as he has led, I've led a bad
life too, and I will not turn upon him.

1091
01:36:03,913 --> 01:36:05,669
The other.

1092
01:36:06,378 --> 01:36:09,412
-Fagin. He has the boy.
-Fagin.

1093
01:36:09,610 --> 01:36:10,951
Find Fagin, you'll find the boy.

1094
01:36:11,145 --> 01:36:13,446
-Where is he?
-Spitalfields.

1095
01:36:13,641 --> 01:36:16,575
That's all I'll say.
I've said too much.

1096
01:36:16,969 --> 01:36:18,791
No one must never know
who told you.

1097
01:36:18,984 --> 01:36:21,351
-Promise.
-I promise.

1098
01:36:21,543 --> 01:36:25,504
-Tomorrow I'll go to the police.
-No, you must do it tonight.

1099
01:36:25,703 --> 01:36:27,613
Just say Fagin,
and the traps will know.

1100
01:36:27,816 --> 01:36:30,718
-The traps?
-The police.

1101
01:36:30,920 --> 01:36:34,051
-What can I do to serve you?
-Nothing.

1102
01:36:34,248 --> 01:36:37,411
You can do nothing.
I am past all hope indeed.

1103
01:36:37,608 --> 01:36:39,582
Take this as a reward.

1104
01:36:39,783 --> 01:36:43,011
No, I've not done this for money.

1105
01:36:43,207 --> 01:36:44,549
God bless you.

1106
01:36:44,742 --> 01:36:47,677
Good night. Good night.

1107
01:36:47,878 --> 01:36:50,694
Never-- Never say who told you.

1108
01:37:02,118 --> 01:37:03,263
Look at him.

1109
01:37:04,997 --> 01:37:06,786
What a shame it is. With his face...

1110
01:37:06,981 --> 01:37:09,086
...he could pick old ladies' pockets
in church.

1111
01:37:09,286 --> 01:37:12,549
His face could be a fortune to us.

1112
01:37:13,190 --> 01:37:15,131
You changing your mind?

1113
01:37:15,335 --> 01:37:16,861
No.

1114
01:37:17,446 --> 01:37:19,486
No, Bill, it has to be done.

1115
01:37:19,686 --> 01:37:21,508
Fagin! Fagin.

1116
01:37:26,693 --> 01:37:29,824
-What's got into you, Dodger?
-I have to see Fagin alone.

1117
01:37:30,020 --> 01:37:31,645
No, no, you can speak
in front of Bill.

1118
01:37:31,845 --> 01:37:35,140
-No, I can't.
-Yes, you can. Speak, Dodger, tell us.

1119
01:37:35,333 --> 01:37:37,372
-Nancy.
-What about Nancy?

1120
01:37:37,573 --> 01:37:40,290
He done a bit of work for me, Bill.
I had him dodge Nancy.

1121
01:37:40,484 --> 01:37:42,010
What do you mean?

1122
01:37:42,213 --> 01:37:44,187
Tell us, Dodger. You followed her?

1123
01:37:44,388 --> 01:37:46,460
Yes. To London Bridge.

1124
01:37:46,660 --> 01:37:48,928
And what?
What on London Bridge?

1125
01:37:49,250 --> 01:37:51,192
She met an old one. A gentleman.

1126
01:37:51,395 --> 01:37:53,053
-And....
-And?

1127
01:37:53,250 --> 01:37:55,257
Speak, will you?!

1128
01:37:56,067 --> 01:37:58,882
She peached.
She told him Fagin had Oliver.

1129
01:37:59,075 --> 01:38:02,937
And the old man was
to go to the traps. Now, tonight.

1130
01:38:08,738 --> 01:38:10,680
-Let me go. Let me out!
-Bill! Bill! A word--

1131
01:38:10,881 --> 01:38:14,907
-Don't speak to me, it's not safe!
-Hear me speak a word!

1132
01:38:15,233 --> 01:38:17,273
Bill, you won't be....

1133
01:38:18,209 --> 01:38:20,315
You won't be too violent, Bill?

1134
01:38:32,641 --> 01:38:33,951
Flit, boys, flit!

1135
01:38:34,145 --> 01:38:36,829
The traps will be at the door
afore you can say "Spitalfields."

1136
01:38:37,025 --> 01:38:38,137
Flit! Flit! Flit!

1137
01:38:38,337 --> 01:38:39,831
Flit!

1138
01:38:40,257 --> 01:38:41,916
Flit!

1139
01:38:42,146 --> 01:38:43,738
Flit!

1140
01:38:43,937 --> 01:38:45,627
Flit!

1141
01:38:46,721 --> 01:38:48,346
Flit!

1142
01:38:50,688 --> 01:38:52,281
Flit!

1143
01:39:18,430 --> 01:39:19,891
Come on.

1144
01:39:44,508 --> 01:39:46,613
Oh, it's you.

1145
01:39:49,950 --> 01:39:51,476
Bill?

1146
01:39:51,676 --> 01:39:53,498
What's the matter?

1147
01:40:01,371 --> 01:40:03,891
Bill, why do you look like that at me?

1148
01:40:05,531 --> 01:40:07,506
There's enough light
for what I've gotta do.

1149
01:40:07,707 --> 01:40:10,096
What--? What have I done?

1150
01:40:10,748 --> 01:40:13,563
-Speak to me.
-You know.

1151
01:40:13,756 --> 01:40:16,057
You was watched tonight.

1152
01:40:16,443 --> 01:40:19,029
Every word you said was heard.

1153
01:40:21,116 --> 01:40:23,537
I-- I never said your name, Bill.

1154
01:40:23,739 --> 01:40:24,950
Never.

1155
01:40:25,147 --> 01:40:26,292
Never.

1156
01:40:26,490 --> 01:40:28,432
Bill. Bill. Bill!

1157
01:40:30,554 --> 01:40:32,310
Oh, God.
Oh, God, have mercy!

1158
01:40:56,056 --> 01:40:57,880
Nance?

1159
01:41:02,360 --> 01:41:04,084
Nance?

1160
01:41:24,791 --> 01:41:26,733
I haven't done nothing.

1161
01:41:26,935 --> 01:41:29,074
Go on, be off with you.

1162
01:41:51,543 --> 01:41:52,949
Hello, Fagey.

1163
01:41:53,142 --> 01:41:55,280
Hello, lads.

1164
01:41:56,726 --> 01:41:59,027
What's the news, Toby?
What's the news?

1165
01:41:59,221 --> 01:42:02,156
I have it here, Fagin.
It's all in The Chronicle.

1166
01:42:02,357 --> 01:42:05,587
You're in it. Bill's in it.
Oliver's in it.

1167
01:42:05,782 --> 01:42:06,927
The Chronicle?

1168
01:42:07,318 --> 01:42:10,514
Fancy that. You're famous, Fagin.

1169
01:42:10,709 --> 01:42:11,691
Read it.

1170
01:42:11,893 --> 01:42:14,032
"More information has reached
your correspondent...

1171
01:42:14,229 --> 01:42:16,945
...concerning the foul
and bestial murder...

1172
01:42:17,141 --> 01:42:20,402
...that took place in Spitalfields and
which has shocked and appalled...

1173
01:42:20,596 --> 01:42:21,741
...the citizens of London.

1174
01:42:23,380 --> 01:42:26,347
It is believed that the victim,
a young woman...

1175
01:42:26,548 --> 01:42:28,556
...now identified as Nancy...

1176
01:42:28,756 --> 01:42:31,406
...was brutally beaten to death...

1177
01:42:31,796 --> 01:42:34,130
...by one William Sykes...

1178
01:42:34,323 --> 01:42:37,138
...a well-known, dangerous villain.

1179
01:42:37,331 --> 01:42:39,306
The motive is as yet unclear...

1180
01:42:39,507 --> 01:42:42,190
...but your correspondent has learned
that the murdered woman...

1181
01:42:42,387 --> 01:42:44,143
...had informed on her associate...

1182
01:42:44,338 --> 01:42:47,186
...and on an infamous fence, Fagin...

1183
01:42:48,114 --> 01:42:53,166
...who is now wanted for the abduction
of a young boy, Oliver Twist.

1184
01:42:54,674 --> 01:42:57,673
Neither Fagin nor Sykes
are presently in custody...

1185
01:42:57,874 --> 01:43:00,394
...but the police are engaged
in searching for them...

1186
01:43:00,594 --> 01:43:02,830
...throughout the city and beyond.

1187
01:43:03,953 --> 01:43:05,895
Sykes, according to the police...

1188
01:43:06,097 --> 01:43:10,733
...is usually accompanied
by a fierce white dog."

1189
01:43:13,360 --> 01:43:14,570
How about that, eh?

1190
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:29,669
Come. Come back here.

1191
01:43:32,720 --> 01:43:34,412
We're going back to London.

1192
01:43:36,465 --> 01:43:38,373
I'll have people to speak to.

1193
01:43:38,576 --> 01:43:42,154
I'll force shiners out of Fagin,
get to France.

1194
01:43:42,352 --> 01:43:43,334
Damn me, we'll risk it.

1195
01:43:48,175 --> 01:43:49,997
Who's he done in?

1196
01:43:51,215 --> 01:43:54,411
-They say-- They say it's a woman.
-He's done in a woman?

1197
01:44:19,758 --> 01:44:21,612
Bullseye.

1198
01:44:22,733 --> 01:44:25,154
Don't you hear me when I whistle?

1199
01:44:25,645 --> 01:44:27,947
You gone deaf or something?

1200
01:44:28,781 --> 01:44:30,723
Come here. Come on.

1201
01:44:32,525 --> 01:44:35,307
I ain't gonna harm you. Come on.
Come on, Bullseye.

1202
01:44:36,268 --> 01:44:38,307
Come here.

1203
01:44:38,508 --> 01:44:41,322
Stop it! I'm warning you.

1204
01:44:41,516 --> 01:44:43,404
Let go, I ain't playing with you!

1205
01:44:43,596 --> 01:44:46,115
Let it go, you stinking varmint!

1206
01:44:46,316 --> 01:44:48,138
Bullseye!

1207
01:44:53,515 --> 01:44:55,206
Bullseye. Bullseye.

1208
01:44:55,628 --> 01:44:57,766
Get back here. Get back here.

1209
01:44:59,979 --> 01:45:01,572
Damn it!

1210
01:45:06,763 --> 01:45:08,356
Look, it's his dog.

1211
01:45:08,555 --> 01:45:10,726
It's his dog!

1212
01:45:15,307 --> 01:45:16,616
Here, boy.

1213
01:45:16,810 --> 01:45:18,698
-Here.
-Don't go near him.

1214
01:45:24,714 --> 01:45:27,300
There is a child in danger,
lnspector Blathers...

1215
01:45:27,498 --> 01:45:28,928
...but you only seem interested...

1216
01:45:29,130 --> 01:45:31,072
...in apprehending this man,
William Sykes.

1217
01:45:31,274 --> 01:45:32,801
Your concern should be...

1218
01:45:33,002 --> 01:45:35,107
-...for the safety of the boy.
-Allow me to say...

1219
01:45:35,305 --> 01:45:37,760
...this is our usual way
of doing business.

1220
01:45:38,889 --> 01:45:40,579
My thinking is this:

1221
01:45:40,777 --> 01:45:43,395
If we get Sykes, we get Fagin.

1222
01:45:43,592 --> 01:45:45,218
-And if we get Fagin--
-Look.

1223
01:45:46,024 --> 01:45:48,893
Sir, we found the dog.

1224
01:45:50,952 --> 01:45:53,473
Are we going to sit here
waiting for the traps to find us?

1225
01:45:53,672 --> 01:45:56,639
-Shut it.
-No, he's right.

1226
01:45:56,840 --> 01:45:59,141
We should do another flit.

1227
01:46:01,672 --> 01:46:03,558
The traps!

1228
01:46:18,471 --> 01:46:19,681
What?

1229
01:46:20,102 --> 01:46:21,247
It's him.

1230
01:46:22,151 --> 01:46:24,005
-Don't let him in.
-We must.

1231
01:46:25,957 --> 01:46:27,615
Go on.

1232
01:46:29,670 --> 01:46:31,459
Go on!

1233
01:46:37,478 --> 01:46:39,867
Don't leave us in the dark.

1234
01:47:33,730 --> 01:47:35,770
Damn you all.

1235
01:47:36,386 --> 01:47:38,873
Have you nothing to say to me?

1236
01:47:39,233 --> 01:47:43,838
-Not safe for you to stop here, Bill.
-lf it's safe for you, it's safe for me.

1237
01:47:47,874 --> 01:47:49,280
Is it...?

1238
01:47:50,401 --> 01:47:51,863
The body, is it buried?

1239
01:47:59,872 --> 01:48:02,425
Dodger, let him in quick.

1240
01:48:04,641 --> 01:48:05,569
Dodger.

1241
01:48:06,753 --> 01:48:08,314
Do as I say.

1242
01:48:12,128 --> 01:48:14,267
Don't come near me, you monster.

1243
01:48:17,952 --> 01:48:19,992
You're my witnesses.
I'm not afraid of him.

1244
01:48:21,375 --> 01:48:23,710
And if they come here after him,
I'll give him up.

1245
01:48:23,904 --> 01:48:25,463
I'll tell them you're here.

1246
01:48:26,687 --> 01:48:29,917
He may kill me if he likes,
but if I'm here, I'll give him up.

1247
01:48:30,112 --> 01:48:32,599
If he was to be boiled alive,
so I would.

1248
01:48:32,799 --> 01:48:34,938
Why, you little--

1249
01:48:35,902 --> 01:48:37,332
Get off me!

1250
01:48:37,535 --> 01:48:39,226
Or I'll tear you limb from limb!

1251
01:48:45,118 --> 01:48:46,329
Help, he's here!

1252
01:48:46,526 --> 01:48:48,664
-He's here. Break down the door!
-Up at the window!

1253
01:48:48,862 --> 01:48:50,805
Help! Come up, please!

1254
01:48:52,990 --> 01:48:55,095
-That's Bill Sykes!
-Damn you all!

1255
01:48:55,294 --> 01:48:57,236
Do your worst. I'll cheat you yet!

1256
01:49:08,253 --> 01:49:11,318
No! Bill, no.
He's our bargaining tool.

1257
01:49:11,517 --> 01:49:14,420
Not yours, Fagin. Mine.

1258
01:49:16,732 --> 01:49:18,226
Bill!

1259
01:49:28,988 --> 01:49:30,361
Don't fire.

1260
01:49:31,867 --> 01:49:33,722
-Don't fire.
-Hold your fire, men.

1261
01:49:33,915 --> 01:49:36,021
-Hold your fire.
-I'll let the boy go.

1262
01:49:36,220 --> 01:49:38,163
I'll let him drop.

1263
01:49:38,364 --> 01:49:40,730
Don't try nothing,
or I'll let him go!

1264
01:49:44,411 --> 01:49:46,233
Get up there.

1265
01:49:46,651 --> 01:49:48,626
Cross, cross.

1266
01:49:51,738 --> 01:49:55,250
Up there. Up there.

1267
01:49:59,035 --> 01:50:02,515
Grab hold of there.
Grab hold of it.

1268
01:50:11,353 --> 01:50:13,458
We must give chase, sir.

1269
01:50:24,441 --> 01:50:26,033
Get down.

1270
01:50:30,200 --> 01:50:31,607
They're getting away!

1271
01:50:31,801 --> 01:50:33,775
There, there. There he is!

1272
01:50:34,776 --> 01:50:35,986
Get him! Get him!

1273
01:50:36,184 --> 01:50:37,842
Damn it!

1274
01:51:09,814 --> 01:51:11,242
Grab it.

1275
01:51:11,446 --> 01:51:13,170
Grab it!

1276
01:52:29,810 --> 01:52:31,816
Oliver?

1277
01:52:32,017 --> 01:52:33,642
Oliver!

1278
01:52:36,082 --> 01:52:38,057
Oliver!

1279
01:52:42,672 --> 01:52:45,422
-Here he is, sir.
-Come along, my boy.

1280
01:52:45,617 --> 01:52:49,261
Mr. Grimwig has something
to say to you.

1281
01:52:50,449 --> 01:52:51,855
Do the honors, Mrs. Bedwin.

1282
01:52:52,049 --> 01:52:56,653
Now then, young man,
I confess I misjudged you.

1283
01:52:56,849 --> 01:53:00,645
Truth to tell, I feared your benefactor
would make me eat my head.

1284
01:53:01,745 --> 01:53:04,777
But he's a good friend
and has pardoned me.

1285
01:53:04,977 --> 01:53:07,431
-And one for Oliver.
-Thank you, sir.

1286
01:53:07,631 --> 01:53:09,225
-So--
-And you too, Mrs. Bedwin.

1287
01:53:09,424 --> 01:53:11,180
-I don't know as I should, sir.
-You must.

1288
01:53:11,375 --> 01:53:15,914
So I'll take the liberty,
if you'll allow me, to salute you.

1289
01:53:16,687 --> 01:53:19,469
-To Sam Waters.
-Oliver Twist.

1290
01:53:19,823 --> 01:53:22,857
Oliver Twist. To Oliver Twist.

1291
01:53:23,599 --> 01:53:25,289
Yes.

1292
01:53:27,695 --> 01:53:31,917
Why, Oliver.
My child, what's the matter?

1293
01:53:32,494 --> 01:53:34,250
Why are you so sad?

1294
01:54:00,363 --> 01:54:02,949
Are you certain, Oliver,
you wish to go through with this?

1295
01:54:03,147 --> 01:54:04,773
Yes, sir.

1296
01:54:04,972 --> 01:54:06,761
Certain.

1297
01:54:12,491 --> 01:54:14,280
Yes?

1298
01:54:57,706 --> 01:55:00,640
Is the young gentleman
to come too, sir?

1299
01:55:00,873 --> 01:55:03,207
It's not a sight for children, sir.

1300
01:55:03,401 --> 01:55:06,565
It is not indeed, my friend.
But this child has seen this man...

1301
01:55:06,760 --> 01:55:08,931
...in the full career
of his success and villainy.

1302
01:55:09,128 --> 01:55:12,030
And it is his wish, even at the cost
of some pain and fear...

1303
01:55:12,232 --> 01:55:14,501
...that he should see him now.

1304
01:55:45,735 --> 01:55:47,457
Eighteen.

1305
01:56:01,991 --> 01:56:03,681
Hey!

1306
01:56:07,749 --> 01:56:08,959
Good boy.

1307
01:56:09,158 --> 01:56:10,913
Good boy, Charley.

1308
01:56:11,109 --> 01:56:13,019
Well done.

1309
01:56:20,262 --> 01:56:23,327
Good boy, Charley, well done.
Well done.

1310
01:56:23,653 --> 01:56:25,987
-Take the boy away to bed.
-Don't be frightened.

1311
01:56:26,180 --> 01:56:27,806
Fagin.

1312
01:56:28,069 --> 01:56:29,792
That's me. An old man, my lord.

1313
01:56:29,989 --> 01:56:32,476
A-- A very old-- Old man.

1314
01:56:33,060 --> 01:56:34,466
Someone here wants to see you.

1315
01:56:34,884 --> 01:56:36,476
-Strike! Strike them all dead!
-Easy.

1316
01:56:36,676 --> 01:56:38,530
What right have they to butcher me?

1317
01:56:38,723 --> 01:56:40,698
Speak to him now.
Quick, if you please.

1318
01:56:40,899 --> 01:56:42,787
For he grows worse
as the time goes on.

1319
01:56:44,900 --> 01:56:47,420
Fagin, you were kind to me.

1320
01:56:47,619 --> 01:56:48,928
Yes, yes.

1321
01:56:49,123 --> 01:56:50,716
I'll be kind again.

1322
01:56:50,915 --> 01:56:52,857
I'll be kind again.

1323
01:56:53,058 --> 01:56:55,359
I'll be kind again.

1324
01:57:00,385 --> 01:57:03,102
-I'm not afraid.
-Oliver!

1325
01:57:07,490 --> 01:57:10,785
Let-- Let me whisper to you.

1326
01:57:12,929 --> 01:57:15,515
You remember the box, Oliver?

1327
01:57:15,713 --> 01:57:18,680
With my pretty things
for my old age, Oliver?

1328
01:57:18,880 --> 01:57:21,914
It's hid a little way up the chimney
in the top front room.

1329
01:57:22,112 --> 01:57:24,217
It's yours, Oliver.

1330
01:57:24,417 --> 01:57:27,350
-Yours, but we must talk.
-Yes, yes.

1331
01:57:27,553 --> 01:57:29,975
But shall we say a prayer
together first?

1332
01:57:30,177 --> 01:57:31,322
Do.

1333
01:57:31,521 --> 01:57:34,936
Say only one, upon your knees,
with me...

1334
01:57:35,137 --> 01:57:37,690
...and we can talk all morning.

1335
01:57:38,272 --> 01:57:39,799
Outside. Outside.

1336
01:57:40,001 --> 01:57:42,650
You can say I've gone to sleep.
They'll believe you.

1337
01:57:42,849 --> 01:57:46,776
You can get me out. The pretty
things are yours, my dear, yours.

1338
01:57:46,976 --> 01:57:50,937
-Oh, God, forgive this wretched man.
-That's right, that's right.

1339
01:57:51,137 --> 01:57:52,282
That will help us on.

1340
01:57:52,480 --> 01:57:56,408
If-- lf-- lf-- If l...

1341
01:57:56,608 --> 01:58:00,885
...shake and tremble as we pass
the gallows, don't-- Don't--

1342
01:58:01,279 --> 01:58:04,890
Don't you mind, hurry on.
Now, now, now.

1343
01:58:05,087 --> 01:58:07,640
-Have you more to say to him, sir?
-Nothing more.

1344
01:58:07,838 --> 01:58:10,620
-You'd better leave him.
-Press on, press on, press on.

1345
01:58:10,814 --> 01:58:12,756
Press on, press on.

1346
01:58:12,959 --> 01:58:15,348
Softly. Softly. No, no!

1347
01:58:15,551 --> 01:58:16,828
It hurts!

1348
01:58:17,022 --> 01:58:18,964
Faster, faster!

1349
01:58:19,166 --> 01:58:21,021
Faster, faster!

1350
01:58:21,215 --> 01:58:24,956
Faster, faster, faster, faster!

1351
01:59:54,142 --> 01:59:57,906
THE END

1352
