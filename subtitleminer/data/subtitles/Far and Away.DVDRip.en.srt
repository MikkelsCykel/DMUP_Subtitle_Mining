00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,400
Let us pass!

2
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,360
Buntin, you landlord bastard!

3
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,840
Her beautiful eyes
were a terrible curse

4
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,560
Three days in his grave
she ran off with his purse

5
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,720
Lads! That bloody landlord
Buntin's on his way in.

6
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,640
All hell's breakin' loose!

7
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,520
Death to all landlords!

8
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,520
l hope they kill him.

9
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,400
Would you look at that bastard, Joe?

10
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,640
Landlord, you sinner!

11
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,480
Between your lungs
there's neither heart nor spirit...

12
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,320
but the lump of your own
swallowed money bag!

13
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,920
He'll never get over that one, Joe.

14
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,080
You're a blight on this country
that never belonged to you!

15
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,440
Out!

16
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,760
Out, you robber!

17
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,240
Hey, Joe.

18
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,280
Come on. Are you hurt, Joe?

19
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,240
Danty, take me home to my sons.

20
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,320
Stand still, you ugly animal.

21
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,000
Whoa.

22
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,960
Whoa, you ugly-

23
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,360
Damn you!
Aw, to hell with you!

24
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,480
- Colm!
- What?

25
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,160
Will you look at our little brother?

26
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,360
He can't keep hold of his ass.

27
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,600
Sweetheart of a child,
slaving away.

28
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,360
ls it not enough, Joseph,
you plowed all that muck down there?

29
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,760
My ambition's a little grander
than yours.

30
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,440
- A couple of lazy cows.
- Oh, ambition, is it?

31
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,040
To break your back on land
that isn't your own?

32
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,680
lt belongs to the landlord Christie.

33
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,600
Hold your face up, lad.

34
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,120
Now, come on.
Give us something we can aim at.

35
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,760
Just shag off, the pair of you.
There's a goat over there.

36
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,520
- Go improve your love life.
- Now, come on, Joseph honey.

37
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,560
Just a nosebleed's all we're asking.

38
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,960
l've no wish to fight you.

39
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,120
Try pummeling me,
you arrogant son of a bitch!

40
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,400
Get him, Pad-

41
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,400
Watch him!
He's riled up now!

42
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,880
Hold still, now.

43
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,800
Stand up, Joseph!

44
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,400
Lads, your father's been damaged!

45
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,000
You're here, Joe.

46
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,680
Da!

47
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,880
Yeah, and he took on the enemy
with his own bare hands-

48
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,720
fifty of them, armed,
and with hideous guns.

49
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,200
And your father-
he walloped them all...

50
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,840
one by one, the whole lot of them.

51
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,000
And l killed off a fair share myself,
to tell the God's truth-

52
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,040
Quiet, Danty Duff, for once.

53
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,680
Yeah, well...

54
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,080
humble as l am, l'll keep that part
of the story for another time.

55
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,000
How are you feeling now, Da?

56
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,960
My soul is departing from me, Joseph.

57
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,640
- Don't you talk that way.
- l'll talk any way l please.

58
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,520
- l'm dying, l tell you!
- Well, you can't die.

59
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,880
- We need you here, Da.
- Need me? What for?

60
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:23,000
Her beautiful eyes
were a terrible curse

61
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,640
God bless your soul.

62
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,560
Poor Joe Donelly.

63
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,960
We'd be as well to sell off a thing
or two now that the old man's gone.

64
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,840
ls that any way to keen
over the death of our father?

65
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,120
Misery's a personal matter, Joseph.

66
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,600
We don't need any instruction.
Thanks.

67
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,400
Sure, he's left us
with a huge debt of rent on the land.

68
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,080
We'll begin to settle our debt
when we harvest the land.

69
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,840
Grow the potatoes and pick them
yourself, Joseph, you ambitious boy!

70
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,840
- You son of a-
- Joseph!

71
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,840
Jesus and the saints preserve us!

72
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,600
We thought you died, Da.

73
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,760
l did, son.
l passed away.

74
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,160
But you're talking to us, Da.

75
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,360
And your eyes-
they're looking about.

76
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,760
l was as dead as a stone,
l tell you.

77
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,920
Now shut your mouth
before l die again.

78
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,600
Well, l am-

79
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,080
Come here!

80
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,560
l've come back
to tell you something.

81
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,560
You're an especially odd boy.

82
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,920
You came back from the dead
to tell me that l'm odd?

83
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,280
You have all kinds of oddities...

84
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,320
clattering around in your brain.

85
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,200
So had l when l was as young as you.

86
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:58,520
But dreams, my boy,
in this poor corner of the world...

87
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,240
end up in a glass of ale.

88
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,920
No. Not my dreams, Da.

89
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,840
l'll work my own land someday.

90
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:11,160
Without land, a man is nothing.

91
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,560
That's it. Yeah.

92
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,200
Land is a man's very own soul.

93
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,920
A miracle-
that's what you're looking for.

94
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:31,120
And by God, if you manage it...

95
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,360
your old da will be
smiling down on you...

96
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,800
from heaven above.

97
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,080
Her beautiful eyes

98
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,240
Were a terrible

99
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,360
God bless your soul, Joe Donelly...

100
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,640
for the second time.

101
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,840
God rest your soul, Da.

102
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,240
Say nothing to them, lads.

103
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,720
This country's ours.
They don't exist.

104
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,680
What dead man is this?

105
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,920
You needn't answer,
but hear these words.

106
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,760
l represent Mr. Daniel Christie,
who by right of law...

107
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,640
owns this land
and all improvements upon it.

108
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,480
Rent on this property
has not been paid.

109
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,480
The warning's been given thrice.

110
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:01,400
Keep walking, lads.
Our father's being buried today.

111
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,760
Bastards are burning our house!

112
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,680
That will do.

113
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,200
Where is this landlord Christie?

114
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,400
l want justice for what he's done.

115
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,120
There's nothing l like better...

116
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,640
than the glow of murder
in a young fellow's eyes.

117
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,760
lt has a terrible go of rust on it.

118
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,880
l've only killed chickens and pigs
till now.

119
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:58,360
He's a pig and a chicken in one,
the same Daniel Christie.

120
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,800
Here, now.
Give him a proper taste of death.

121
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,720
Yeah. Landlords.

122
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,840
Captain Moonlight.

123
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:21,280
Don't pretend you know what Captain
Moonlight means, 'cause you don't.

124
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,560
lt's the code, the rebel code.

125
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,400
Now that you've heard it,
keep it to yourself.

126
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,400
Don't breathe it to a living soul.
Do you understand?

127
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,960
Captain Moonlight, Joseph.

128
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,400
Off to kill your landlord, eh?

129
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,720
Blow the bastard's head off!

130
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,640
Don't be afraid to kill him.

131
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,400
Assassinate the bastard!

132
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,520
lt was too good to be kept a secret.

133
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,960
Do you know which end of the gun
to point at the gentleman?

134
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,840
He'll shoot himself in the balls,
l'll wager...

135
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,840
and come hobbling home in tears.

136
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,880
Good-bye, Colm.
Good-bye, Paddy.

137
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,720
Good-bye, Joseph.
We'll see you at your wake.

138
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,120
God bless all in this house.

139
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,640
God bless you, son.

140
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,680
Down from the north, are you?

141
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,280
Or perhaps the east?

142
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,960
West of here, maybe?

143
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,880
South.

144
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,760
l prefer to keep my business
to myself, if you please.

145
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,200
Very wise.

146
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,800
God bless you, everyone.

147
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,720
Ah, bless you, sir.

148
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,440
- Whiskey for everyone!
- Oh, great!

149
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,040
How are you, sir, tonight?

150
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,360
Oppressed.

151
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,440
That's the word for me.

152
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,720
l live in a house
that's stuffy and dull...

153
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,400
and worse, l've a wife
who forbids me to drink.

154
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,280
- God help you.
- l crave adventure, boys.

155
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:10,120
lf l had wings,
l'd fly to the stars.

156
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,880
Your good health, sir.

157
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,600
Good health, Mr. Christie.

158
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,440
Liven up, lad.

159
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,800
You're too young to be brooding
in your ale.

160
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,920
What places you
in this small chapter of the world?

161
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,600
He's keeping himself to himself,
that one.

162
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,840
Oh, then it's one of two things:

163
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,280
enterprise or love.

164
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:49,520
lt isn't love.
Rest assured of that.

165
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,440
Then you're a man of business...

166
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,280
like myself.

167
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,800
But l warn you...

168
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,600
it's brought me nothing but misery.

169
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,360
l'm lost in a fog
of commerce and compromise.

170
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:06,880
l'd trade it all away
for 15 minutes of freedom.

171
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,400
Freedom is a rare thing
in these parts.

172
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,280
lt is.

173
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,280
- lt is, indeed.
- Oh, indeed it is.

174
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,160
To a long and happy life...

175
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,800
Mr. Christie.

176
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,720
God bless you, lad.

177
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,320
Why should l expire

178
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:44,880
For the fire of any eye

179
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,600
Though foolish men you slay

180
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,440
For thee l shall not die

181
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,360
Your beauty and your name

182
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,520
Will never conquer me

183
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,440
What have l done

184
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,000
Hello...

185
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,400
souls of the departed...

186
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,240
what a disappointment
l must seem to you all.

187
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,760
Oh, no. Here we are- home.

188
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,240
l recognize these hedges
by their dullness.

189
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,640
O woman, high of fame

190
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,280
Though men have died for thee

191
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,920
This is a difficult murder.

192
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,160
Good evening, Mr. Christie.

193
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,920
Take the horse.

194
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,320
Shannon, l saw you galloping
in the fields.

195
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,840
Dignity, Shannon, Dignity.

196
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:04,960
A lady must always be civilized,
even when she rides.

197
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,320
No one saw me riding, Mother.

198
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,280
- l saw you!
- Yes, Mother.

199
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,080
''A lady must always be civilized.''

200
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,760
She never leaves us alone,
does she?

201
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,240
No, she doesn't.

202
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,840
There. Go on. Good girl.

203
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,880
ls somebody there?

204
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,880
Stay right where you are.

205
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,480
Don't flutter an eyelid
or l'll stab you.

206
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,720
l'll stab you through.

207
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,960
Father!

208
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,360
Jesus!

209
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,040
Father, help!

210
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,040
l've been all but raped
and slaughtered!

211
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,160
- What is it?
- ln the stables!

212
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,000
- What's the fuss about?
- lt's the devil himself!

213
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,200
- Mr. Daniel Christie!
- Oh, my God!

214
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,400
Look!

215
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,640
Yes?

216
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,360
l'm Joseph Donelly...

217
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,800
of the family Donelly
that you pushed off our land.

218
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,080
What in the name of God
are you talking about?

219
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,360
Prepare to pay for your crimes.

220
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,440
Good Lord Jesus!

221
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,480
Captain Moonlight.

222
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,000
Shannon, come back!

223
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,600
Quickly, find Mr. Chase
and bring him here. Go!

224
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,200
Shannon, come inside.

225
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,200
Shannon, turn around.

226
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,760
Look how black his fingers are,
Mother.

227
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:46,880
Never mind his fingers.
He's a lowborn blatherskite of filth.

228
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,920
lf he's so worthless, then why are you
bothering to dress his wounds?

229
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,600
Our duty is to restore him
to full health...

230
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,240
so he can hear his own neck crack when
he dangles from the hangman's noose.

231
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,320
Turn away, Shannon,
and protect the innocence of your eyes.

232
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,920
Of all the days
to intrude upon our peaceful life.

233
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:11,160
The ladies are coming by
this afternoon for tea.

234
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,840
l'm feeling very sick
all of a sudden.

235
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,360
Mind yourself, Shannon. Those ladies are
models of manners and behavior.

236
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,400
There.

237
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,760
- Nothing happened!
- Nothing happened, indeed.

238
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:34,840
A poor, misguided robin has
broken a windowpane.

239
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,880
What a manufactured lie.

240
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,280
l was merely dusting
the liquor cabinet.

241
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,720
As if a bottle in your vicinity
stood long enough to gather dust.

242
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,920
Now, go upstairs.
l can manage in here.

243
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,920
Oh, look at what you've done.

244
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:52,600
Mary, Mary, Mary Nell

245
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:57,080
Do you hear your wedding bell

246
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:01,600
Will he love you, Mary Nell

247
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,760
Time and time alone will tell

248
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,520
You're having a dream.
This isn't really happening.

249
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,320
l want my land!

250
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:13,240
What became of the man l married?

251
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,120
Some other man's replaced him
and goes about with his name.

252
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:23,320
A murderous insurgent
under your own roof!

253
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,960
How horrible!

254
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,040
He's as ugly as sin...

255
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,920
and the most vicious creature
l've ever set eyes upon.

256
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,520
Did you get a look at him, Shannon?

257
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,400
A peek.

258
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,680
Shannon, what is your collar doing?

259
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,360
- lt's choking me.
- Well, do it up.

260
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,760
Better to choke
than to be vulgar.

261
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,720
l hear a noise.

262
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,240
Let us hope it's Stephen Chase.

263
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,560
We've come for your prisoner,
Mr. Christie.

264
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,880
Good afternoon, Mrs. Christie.

265
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,800
Good afternoon, ladies.

266
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,200
Speak of the sun
and we see its rays.

267
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,880
Oh, my goodness,
we were so frightened.

268
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,360
Keep calm.
You're safe and protected.

269
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,680
Go back to your sinful card playing.

270
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,760
Hello, Shannon.

271
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,240
Hello, Stephen.

272
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,720
My, how handsome he is.

273
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,320
He's a brilliant young man.
He was educated at Trinity.

274
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,840
Of course.

275
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,840
He manages all my husband's
business affairs.

276
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,040
Your daughter is certainly
a very lucky girl.

277
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,040
Yes, indeed.

278
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:06,400
Shannon, the ladies and l
would like you to play the piano.

279
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,000
l beg your pardon?

280
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,680
Come play something, Shannon.
Something fanciful and nice.

281
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,600
She plays beautifully.

282
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,360
Good gracious, child.

283
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,520
- lt's band music, Mother.
- ''Band music''?

284
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,880
lt's very modern.
lt's from America.

285
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,520
Shannon, stay back.

286
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,480
Careful, boy.
Your life's worth little as it is.

287
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:06,280
You're the bastard
that burned my father's house.

288
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:11,680
l've burned many houses in the line
of duty. Am l meant to remember yours?

289
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,480
Maybe you'll remember this.

290
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:32,080
Pistols, tomorrow at dawn.

291
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,040
Get him upstairs!

292
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,600
Go on.

293
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:55,200
Come, ladies. Let us resume
our pleasantries in the parlor.

294
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,680
Come, dear.
You, too, Shannon.

295
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,960
What's buzzing around inside
that head of yours, my little monkey?

296
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,360
The day's been disrupted, Father.

297
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,840
Heaven forbid.

298
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,640
l'm running away.

299
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,120
Excuse me.

300
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,920
There's something in here l need.

301
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,040
Perhaps you're wondering
why l'm running away.

302
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,560
Well, l'll tell you.

303
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:26,040
l'm running away
because l'm modern.

304
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:29,880
l'm modern,
and l'm going to a modern place.

305
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,160
You're not the only one
who's trapped.

306
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,520
lf l stay here, my mother will turn me
into one of her stuffy old friends.

307
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,320
No, thank you.
l'm a little more interesting than that.

308
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:48,760
l'm very smart, and l'm very modern.
That's all you need to know about me.

309
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,000
Boy, here!

310
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,920
Have a look at this.

311
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,040
Look.

312
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,280
You can't read, can you?
How pathetic.

313
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,800
''Land,'' it says.

314
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,280
''Land''?

315
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,800
''Wanted:
strong, healthy men and women.

316
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:21,160
Every resident of the United States
is entitled to 160 acres of land.''

317
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,480
They've got so much of it
they give it away for free.

318
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,880
No land is given away...

319
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,920
in any part of the world.

320
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,520
ln America it is...

321
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,800
and l'm going there.

322
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,800
l'm going to have
a place of my own.

323
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,120
And l will have horses on it,
and l will raise them...

324
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,920
and l will ride them
any way l please.

325
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:47,640
What do you need more land for?
You own half of lreland as it is!

326
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,640
You took it, your people did!

327
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,200
l didn't take it.

328
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:57,040
You just live here
all fancied up on rent...

329
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,240
and broken backs.

330
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:02,040
Boy, you said you wanted land.

331
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,400
lf that's what you want,
then come with me.

332
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,680
Great ships sail
out of Dublin and Liverpool.

333
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,440
But a woman dare not travel alone.

334
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,280
You're brave. You shoot men,
you step on their necks.

335
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,760
When l saw that, l realized
you could be very useful to me.

336
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,920
- Useful, could l?
- Yes! You could be my serving boy.

337
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,280
Oh, l see.

338
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,320
l could polish your boots for you.

339
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,720
They will need a polish
now and then.

340
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,240
Aye, they would.
And l could make you a cup of tea.

341
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,000
When teatime calls for it, yes.

342
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,840
l'll throw the tea in your face and l'll
piss on your boots before l serve you!

343
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,080
Get out!

344
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,240
- l'll pay you threepence a day.
- Get out!

345
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:51,120
l've got an appointment in the morning,
and l'm going to honor it.

346
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,720
Ha! You'll never win this duel
with Stephen.

347
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:57,280
We've all seen you handle a gun.
Boy, l am giving you your freedom!

348
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,280
l'm not going to a distant world.

349
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,240
l'm of lreland,
and l'll stay in lreland till l die.

350
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,160
That's in about five hours.

351
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,160
These weapons belonged
to my father's father.

352
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,440
His father's father was an ass.

353
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:38,040
l've asked to serve as your second
in this barbarism.

354
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,680
l appreciate that, sir.

355
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,480
Choose one of those things.

356
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,040
You had a good breakfast this morning,
did you?

357
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:00,000
- lt was grand, sir. Thank you.
- Good.

358
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,960
Count away 15 paces.

359
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:08,920
- One, two.
- This way, son.

360
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,800
- Three, four-
- Ah, fog.

361
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,840
My life is one long mollifying fog.

362
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,440
The land l hold, l inherited.

363
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,720
lt manages itself
with a foggy logic of its own.

364
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:25,120
Son, l was up thinking about you
all night long.

365
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:29,440
l knew nothing of your family or their
eviction. l'm sorry for their pain.

366
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:34,520
l understand why you came to murder me,
and l don't blame you for it at all.

367
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,320
Fifteen!

368
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,080
Turn, each man, and fire!

369
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,880
l can't see anything!

370
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,600
l can.

371
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,480
Boy! Come away from there!

372
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,480
Shannon, get out of the way!

373
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,720
- Assess your stupidity, lad.
- Get away from me, woman!

374
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,160
As you wish.

375
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,520
- Wait!
- Shannon!

376
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,000
Shannon, don't!

377
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,360
Good-bye, Stephen.

378
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:21,320
''Good-bye''? Don't shoot!

379
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,360
l saved your neck.
You remember that.

380
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,360
Afternoon.

381
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:01,880
- Thank you, boy.
- Don't call me ''boy.''

382
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,920
Sugar.

383
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,280
Two.

384
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,800
You might display some gratitude
considering l paid for your passage.

385
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,480
l paid, let me remind you.

386
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,440
Oh, good afternoon.

387
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,560
Forgive me if l'm intruding,
but l wonder...

388
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,960
if you'd enjoy a gentle stroll
around the deck.

389
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,560
She's drinking her tea now.

390
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,600
There's no need
to state the obvious, boy.

391
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,520
My name's McGuire,
from Boston, Massachusetts.

392
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,360
Oh, you're American.

393
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:53,080
lrish born.
l went back for personal reasons.

394
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,480
A stroll would be delightful,
Mr. McGuire.

395
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,080
Parasol.

396
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:07,080
ln my imagination,
America is a wonderfully modern place.

397
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,480
- Am l right?
- Modern as modern can be.

398
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,880
The people, the culture,
the industry.

399
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:15,160
- What about the land?
- l beg your pardon?

400
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:18,240
This girl's got it in her head
that they're giving land away for free.

401
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,760
That's true. Oklahoma territory.
The west's opening up.

402
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,560
- l told you, boy.
- Can't be good land.

403
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,640
lt's the finest in the world.
Seeds flourish in it.

404
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:30,200
The cattle that grow upon it
are fat as elephants.

405
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:33,080
How do you get it, Mr. McGuire?
ls it there when you step off the boat?

406
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,480
Oh, no. You have to travel
1,000 miles or so.

407
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,560
When you get there, you'll have to
run for the land in a race.

408
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,360
A race?

409
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,280
Don't lose time in Boston.

410
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,360
As soon as you can,
purchase horses, a wagon and supplies.

411
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,600
Have l upset you?

412
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,240
l didn't expect it
to be so complicated.

413
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:57,080
We're very fortunate. Any difficulty
can be overcome with money.

414
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:03,280
Excuse me. l'd like
to speak with Mr. McGuire alone.

415
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,880
Mr. McGuire, l do have money...

416
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,800
but it's in the form of spoons.

417
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,040
- Spoons?
- Ancient spoons made of silver.

418
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,720
l'd planned to sell them
when l arrived in Boston.

419
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,600
Well, l can recommend a couple of shops
that will treat you honestly.

420
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,400
Oh, l'm very much obliged to you, sir.

421
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,160
- Pleasure's mine.
- Thank you.

422
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,520
May l ask what are you doing
sitting at my table?

423
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,360
l'm eating your chocolate cake.

424
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,600
l see. And what have you done
with my father's necktie?

425
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:47,880
l flung it into the sea.
lt was gagging my throat.

426
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,280
You're just upset because everything
l've told you is turning out to be true.

427
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:57,000
''Cows as fat as elephants.''

428
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,480
l know what that man's after.

429
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,480
l think you should
cover your ankles.

430
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,600
America.

431
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,640
l'm here. l've made it.

432
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,680
l've arrived, Joseph.

433
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,120
l beg your pardon.

434
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,240
United States of America flags!

435
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,680
You're an American today!

436
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:47,640
Your great friend
Mr. McGuire has vanished.

437
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,360
You want American dollars?

438
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,280
Oh, there he is!
Mr. McGuire!

439
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,200
Over here!

440
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,680
Ah, there you are.

441
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,520
Hey, mister, you lrish?
l can take you to the ward boss.

442
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:07,760
Need work? Need lodging?
There are people who hate the lrish.

443
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,240
You can't get nothing without the ward
boss. He's the biggest man in Boston.

444
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,640
Go fleece somebody else, boy.

445
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:16,800
l know the games of these shysters.
Come on, Miss Christie.

446
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,720
l'll find you a suitable hotel.

447
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,120
Cab!

448
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,040
Thank goodness for Mr. McGuire.

449
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,320
Take Miss Christie here
to a decent hotel.

450
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:34,040
Well, you've certainly upheld
your end of the bargain.

451
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,920
Good luck, Shannon.

452
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,680
Good luck, Joseph.

453
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:54,280
Need jobs, need lodgings? lf you're
lrish, l'll take you to the ward boss.

454
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:56,960
Hey, McGuire!

455
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,800
- Yes?
- Welcome back.

456
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:09,360
Oh, my God! My spoons!
They're taking my spoons!

457
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:12,600
Joseph, Mr. McGuire stole my spoons!

458
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:16,080
No, please, they're mine.
He stole them from me.

459
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:22,480
That dead man stole my spoons.
My bag! They're taking everything!

460
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:32,640
Now l have nothing.

461
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,680
Come away, Shannon.
We have to go.

462
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:37,720
l have nothing now.
l have no money.

463
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:41,480
God is punishing me, Joseph.

464
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:44,640
l stole those spoons from my mother
the morning l ran away.

465
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,120
Hey, you! Stand still!

466
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:50,200
- l didn't do nothing!
- Who's this man, the ward boss?

467
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,360
That's him there,
fighting in the fancy clothes.

468
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:00,840
Mike Kelly, his name is.

469
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,680
- l'll take it.
- Come on!

470
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,080
Shannon, you should
stand back over there.

471
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:11,200
Don't shield me, Joseph.
lt's only a boxing match.

472
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,080
What?

473
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,280
Sorry, Mike.

474
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:22,160
Mike isn't happy when he loses.

475
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,680
You distracted me.

476
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,160
You weren't concentrating.

477
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,240
A scrappy Connemara man, huh?

478
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,080
Fresh off the boat.

479
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,080
Follow me.

480
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,120
Not you, woman.
You just cost me part of a tooth.

481
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:03,080
- lf he gets to go, then l get to go.
- l'm Mike Kelly!

482
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:06,240
Who is this bit of a snit anyway?
Your wife?

483
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:09,520
- Certainly not.
- Then who the hell are you, lass?

484
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,640
- She's...
- l'm-

485
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,240
my sister.

486
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:17,200
- Tell me she isn't a pain in the ass.
- Settle your bets!

487
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,480
''Sister''? Our blood's not even
the same temperature.

488
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:26,000
These people are my kind of people.

489
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:30,040
And my kind doesn't like your kind.

490
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:35,320
ln fact,
they hate everything about you.

491
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:43,360
Now...

492
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:45,880
for some reason or other
l'm willing to lie for you.

493
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:50,200
Or we could tell them you're
a rich Protestant. Might be sporting.

494
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:51,600
No, Joseph.

495
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:54,800
My brother.

496
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,080
Good.

497
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:07,640
- What do you call yourself?
- Joseph Donelly.

498
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:10,400
Well, Donelly, let's put you
on the road to citizenship.

499
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:14,240
We'll get you working
and get you voting when the time comes.

500
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:17,320
See how the system works here, lad?

501
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:20,880
Stop it!

502
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,040
- Leave me alone!
- 'Twas a lady who took to the street

503
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:26,320
- Her name was Biddy McMack
- Get away or l'll claw your eyes out!

504
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:29,400
She makes a handsome living
out of laying on her back

505
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:32,000
- l said leave me alone!
- Excuse me, Mr. Kelly.

506
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
l'm not a wealthy man

507
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,840
But give me a night of paradise
l'll pay you what l can

508
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,280
Get away!

509
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:44,480
l'll ask you
to leave this lady alone.

510
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,400
Go ahead and ask.

511
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,400
l've no wish to fight you.

512
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,960
He's no wish to fight me.

513
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,680
l'll take him.

514
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,920
No, he's mine.

515
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,720
He's mine alone.

516
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,200
Kill him, Joseph!

517
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,760
Well, now.

518
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,880
You knocked the piss out of the man
who knocked the piss out of me.

519
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:37,880
l'm not sure
how l feel about that.

520
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:40,960
- Dermody.
- Yes, sir, Mr. Kelly.

521
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,680
Time to make the rounds.

522
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:45,560
We'll take this scrapper
and the girl...

523
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:47,840
and lodge them at Molly Kay's.

524
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:49,760
- Grab the luggage.
- Yes, sir.

525
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:52,160
Come on.

526
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:57,440
Hey, Pete. Get a match going
these fellows can bet on. l'll be back.

527
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:59,840
Hey, Mike, how are you doing?

528
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:02,520
All depends, huh?
Good to see you lads.

529
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:04,640
- This is it. Here we are.
- Good day to you, Mr. Kelly!

530
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:11,720
- Molly!
- lt's as unpleasant for me as for you.

531
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:14,520
Got a brother and sister here,
Molly, need a room.

532
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:17,960
You're in luck.
We had a suicide just this morning.

533
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:23,520
- Hello, Bridget. How are you?
- Hello, Mike.

534
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,400
Ah, yes.
Any gentlemen up here, girls?

535
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,640
No, not here, Mike.

536
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:31,760
- Make an announcement, Dermody.
- Ward boss!

537
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:34,560
- l'd give you another year.
- You're not campaigning, Mike.

538
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:37,240
Relax, Molly. Politics is
more important to these men than sex.

539
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:39,160
And l'm the Virgin Mary.

540
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:41,480
- God forgive you, Molly.
- Not likely, Mike.

541
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:43,080
Come on.

542
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:46,280
ls that Jimmy Dunne l see?
l was chatting with your wife today.

543
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:48,960
Don't tell my wife, Mike.

544
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:53,280
And here's the bath, but don't linger
in it too long. lt's the only one.

545
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:57,080
Gentlemen,
button up your trousers.

546
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:03,600
This is your room here.

547
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,240
Ours?

548
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,320
You're not suggesting
that we share this room, l hope.

549
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:12,920
l don't care what you do in it...

550
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:15,880
as long as you pay me
a dollar a week.

551
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:19,840
There must be some mistake.
We need two rooms.

552
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:22,240
- l've only got the one.
- That's not good enough.

553
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:25,600
- Mike, what have you sent me here?
- You're not listening to me.

554
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:28,760
The room is fine,
and we'll take it gratefully.

555
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:30,560
As you know,
election time is coming up-

556
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:35,920
Your sister was spoilt, l'd say.

557
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,480
Here for your support.

558
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:41,200
l'm sure you've noticed
all these ltalians taking lrish jobs.

559
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:45,320
No ltalians are gonna run this town
as long as Mike Kelly's in charge.

560
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,080
Shannon, are you awake?

561
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:21,800
No, l'm sound asleep.

562
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:25,520
l think l like America.

563
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:29,160
- Do you, now?
- Aye.

564
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:33,960
We've only been here a day.
Look at the welcome we've got.

565
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:35,480
Would you like a room?
Here you go.

566
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:40,080
Would you like a job?
Why, here you go.

567
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:43,080
How about some land?

568
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:44,880
Well, get a horse,
and help yourself.

569
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:48,520
So, now you believe me
about the land, do you?

570
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,880
lf they're throwing it away,
l wouldn't mind a piece of it.

571
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:02,080
Maybe this is my destiny.

572
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:07,640
On his deathbed, my father told me
he'd be watching me from up above.

573
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:13,200
l wonder now if his spirit
might be near, guiding me along.

574
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:16,640
lf he bumps into Mr. McGuire up there,
tell him l want my spoons back.

575
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
lmagine me...

576
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,080
Joseph Donelly,
standing on my own plot of land.

577
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,760
What would l plant, l wonder?

578
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:31,120
Oats, corn, potatoes-

579
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:34,000
Oh, God, no, not potatoes.

580
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,640
Maybe wheat.

581
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:38,040
Wheat.

582
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:41,280
Oh, Shannon...

583
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,960
l'm dreaming of it now.

584
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:47,720
Great fields of wheat
as far as the eye can see.

585
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:51,360
Oklahoma land was my idea,
you blathering fool!

586
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:53,360
''Maybe this is my destiny.''

587
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,880
lf it weren't for me, farm boy,
you wouldn't even be here!

588
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:58,920
Well, if it weren't for me,
Miss High and Mighty...

589
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:01,440
you'd have died
outside in the street.

590
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,600
Give me back my pillow.

591
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:12,440
Not in a hundred years.

592
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,480
This book is irritating me.

593
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,960
Do you actually think
you're fooling me, Daniel?

594
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:59,920
Would you prefer l proclaim
my independence and drink in the open?

595
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,520
l like the system we've got.

596
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:11,040
How could she be so cruel?

597
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:13,440
Not to send us any word.

598
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:19,600
She's in America, Nora.

599
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:29,160
She's been writing to me
for some time now.

600
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:36,080
You hid these from me?

601
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:40,960
At Shannon's request.

602
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,360
Read them now...

603
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:45,480
though they may not
bring you comfort.

604
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:59,280
- Death to the landlord!
- Burn the house to the ground!

605
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,800
Burn it down!

606
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:05,320
Captain Moonlight!

607
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,120
Get out of the house, Nora!

608
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:16,920
- Oh, the letters!
- Leave the letters alone, Nora!

609
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,840
Burn down every last one of them!

610
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:27,680
Come with me.

611
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,880
Stephen!
We're over here!

612
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:31,800
Quickly. This way.

613
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,520
All of your life,
collected and destroyed.

614
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:04,120
l'm truly sorry
for your loss.

615
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:11,320
Does this mean we're finished?
Are we impoverished now?

616
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:15,160
No, sir. You still have your land
and your holdings.

617
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:26,200
This is no longer the lreland
of my birth.

618
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:33,840
Our daughter's fallen
into perilous ruin, Daniel.

619
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:36,040
- We must go to her now.
- Shannon?

620
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:42,280
She's-

621
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:44,680
She's been in Boston
these many months.

622
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,480
Then we shall find her there.

623
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:54,480
You over there, keep working.

624
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,400
lf you don't work,
you don't get paid.

625
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,600
Get those chickens plucked.

626
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:09,040
Get to work.

627
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:19,200
l think the prettiest girl
in this factory...

628
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:23,040
one with the prettiest eyes and the
prettiest red hair is Joseph's sister.

629
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,080
lf you don't mind my saying so.

630
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:27,160
You can say what you like, lad.

631
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:31,280
But l warn you,
that redhead has a bite that stings.

632
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:35,600
Get to work.

633
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,720
Get your filthy hands off me,
you ugly animal.

634
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:43,880
That'll cost you a day's wage.

635
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:51,040
Go ahead.
lnsult me again.

636
00:56:58,040 --> 00:56:59,120
Pig.

637
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:04,280
There goes tomorrow.

638
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:07,760
Done?

639
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:23,480
Take Friday as well, you spineless
little fraction of a man.

640
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:27,960
Bite, lads. Bite.

641
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:49,960
What are you looking at?

642
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:56,160
l'm just trying to figure out
what you're doing there.

643
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,760
lt's obvious what l'm doing.
l'm cleaning my clothes.

644
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:01,080
l see.

645
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:04,520
Do you ever wonder
why it takes you so long?

646
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:06,360
My clothes, if you notice,
if you look about...

647
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:10,160
are washed and hung- done.

648
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:14,680
Your talent astounds me, Joseph.

649
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:18,920
Move over.
Move over.

650
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:24,000
lf you want to clean your clothes,
you have to get your hands wet.

651
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,640
First, you place the board
like so.

652
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:31,960
You take the soap in your right hand,
the clothes in the left.

653
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:34,440
Then you brush the soap
across the clothes twice.

654
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:36,440
Like so.

655
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:38,280
Then you plunge and scrub.

656
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:40,400
You plunge and scrub.

657
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,440
And plunge and scrub and lift.

658
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:52,480
And if it's still not clean,
well, then you go again.

659
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:54,760
You plunge and scrub.

660
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:58,240
You keep on plunging and scrubbing...

661
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:02,560
till all your plunging and scrubbing
is done.

662
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:12,600
Thirty, forty...

663
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:16,920
forty-five-
forty-five, fifty.

664
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:19,600
You could be a banker, Joseph,
with your ability to count.

665
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:22,200
Oh, a compliment.

666
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:25,760
Thank you, Shannon.

667
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:28,240
Don't suppose you've calculated
what the journey will cost.

668
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:32,280
lf l barter, l can get a buckboard
for under 25.

669
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:34,480
lt's the harness that's costly.

670
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:37,360
Bit, frame-

671
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:43,680
Frame, collar, reins.

672
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:46,760
Oh. Very impressive.

673
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:50,480
How much have you saved?

674
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:54,320
Are you still praying you'll
make it to the Oklahoma land race?

675
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:57,680
- l'll get there.
- Ha! What a corker.

676
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,240
You're a corker, Shannon.

677
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:04,320
Why don't you go back home to lreland?
Write to your parents for money.

678
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:07,760
They'll forgive you
for your petty foolishness.

679
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:15,520
America may not be exactly
what l thought it would be, but...

680
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:17,520
if l went back to lreland,
l wouldn't-

681
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:21,200
What?

682
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,280
Wouldn't what?

683
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:25,480
l said l'll get there,
and l'll get there- by myself.

684
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:28,560
Well, you need supplies.

685
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:32,960
- Of course. Food, clothes-
- Ammunition, gun.

686
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:36,440
Whenever l think of guns,
l remember Stephen Chase.

687
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:42,480
You're lucky to be rid
of that piss-headed snob.

688
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:47,160
Oh, he wasn't so bad.
You didn't know him as well as l did.

689
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:49,840
l knew him well enough.

690
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:52,160
Me, he adored.

691
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:54,280
He worshiped me.

692
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:56,360
There wasn't a puddle of mud
he didn't lay his coat upon...

693
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:58,200
for me to walk across.

694
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:13,440
- Are you facing east?
- Aye. Facing east.

695
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:16,440
All right.

696
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:20,560
Almost ready.

697
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:22,480
Thanks be to Jesus.

698
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:25,520
Light.

699
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:35,200
l'm in.

700
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:47,960
Good night, Shannon.

701
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:03,520
What?

702
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:09,840
Am l beautiful at all?

703
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:28,440
l've never seen anything like you
in all my living life.

704
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:32,360
Good.

705
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:55,960
Let's have another boxing match.
We need another challenger.

706
01:02:55,960 --> 01:02:59,720
This man has not been defeated tonight.
Will anyone box him?

707
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:02,320
Any challengers to-
Oh, sir, you can beat him.

708
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:04,680
- You've got the face of a winner.
- l'll fight him.

709
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:12,760
No! No, no, no, no!

710
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,680
Joseph, there's rules
in this club.

711
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:17,360
Toe the line and all that.
You got to wait until l signal.

712
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,720
Toe the line, gentlemen.

713
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:28,880
No kicking, no biting, no gouging.

714
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:34,520
- Fight me here, farmer!
- Put your foot on the line.

715
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:39,320
- Right.
- Toe the line. Toe the line.

716
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:41,160
- Get away.
- Put your toe on the line.

717
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:48,800
- Come on. You're yellow!
- Come on!

718
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:53,240
Go on, scrapper!

719
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:11,360
Stop it.
You've won, Joseph. Stop it.

720
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:15,760
What a fight!
l knew you had it in you.

721
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:18,840
Girls, get up the burly-cue.

722
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:21,440
- What do you call yourself again?
- Joseph. Joseph Donelly.

723
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:24,760
That's right. You clobbered
that fella's brains out, lad.

724
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:27,000
l discovered this fella
fresh off the boat.

725
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:32,360
Gordon, get this scrapper
something to smoke.

726
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:37,040
Who's your boy there, Kelly?

727
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:40,880
A newfangled style of fighting
he's got there.

728
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:42,920
He's slippery, all right.

729
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:45,320
Shake hands with Mr. D'Arcy Bourke,
member of the city council.

730
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:49,600
l'll shake your hand, Mr. Bourke,
but l'm not in a friendly mood.

731
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:52,320
l came here to fight.
There's fight left in me yet.

732
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:54,520
He's a lively one, Kelly.

733
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:57,880
Would you box an ltalian
if l scared one up?

734
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:01,400
l'll box any man
you put in front of me.

735
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:03,320
Mike! Mike! Mike!

736
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:06,880
Jesus Christ, Dermody.
When's your voice gonna change?

737
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:08,720
- We've got another pug.
- Bring him on.

738
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:10,040
And l'll put money on you.

739
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:13,120
Place your bets, gentlemen.

740
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:16,200
The boy's got an appetite, Kelly.

741
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:18,000
Toe the line, gentlemen.

742
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:37,760
lt's nothing!
l'm feeling grand tonight.

743
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:42,440
Steady now, you rogue.

744
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:50,600
- What happened?
- Help me get him into bed.

745
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:53,280
Joseph, you're covered in blood.
What happened to you?

746
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:57,520
He's been prize fighting,
but he'll survive.

747
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:01,240
He had a charge of gunpowder in him
that needed to go off.

748
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:03,360
And who might you be?

749
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:05,960
l'm Grace.
l work at the social club.

750
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:08,720
l did well tonight, didn't l?

751
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:14,280
You beat 'em all.
But don't talk now.

752
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:19,200
Get some sleep.

753
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:25,600
l need to talk to you.

754
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:34,360
You're his sister, right?

755
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:36,280
What sort of man is he?

756
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:38,280
l mean, besides tough
and handsome as the devil?

757
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:40,560
Well, he's extremely moody.

758
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:43,440
Ah. l believe that.

759
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:46,800
Full of spit, isn't he?
And passion?

760
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:49,880
No. Not really, no.
He's fairly dull.

761
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:55,720
Dull? Well, l don't know
what sort of men you're used to...

762
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:57,560
but he's anything but dull.

763
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:02,160
And the build on him-

764
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:04,440
Me and the girls got swollen eyes
from gawking at his bum.

765
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:07,320
Yes, well, good-bye, Grace.

766
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:09,720
- Would you tell him l-
- Nice to meet you.

767
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:11,920
- l just want to tell him-
- Good night, Grace.

768
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:18,080
- That was Grace.
- So she said.

769
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:20,080
She dances in the burly-cue.

770
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:23,080
Yes, well, never mind her now.
Just lay there.

771
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:25,560
No, no.
Joseph, lie still. Lie still.

772
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:27,760
Look in my boot down there.

773
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:35,520
- Four dollars.
- l won it.

774
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:37,440
That's more than plucking chickens
in a month.

775
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:41,280
l'll have my horse and buggy money
before the winter comes...

776
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:44,160
and it won't be
from plucking chickens.

777
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:46,280
There are other ways
to get to Oklahoma, Joseph.

778
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:49,440
You should have heard them,
Shannon...

779
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:51,240
cheering me on.

780
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:55,200
lt was grand.

781
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:57,960
So grand.

782
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:07,840
Toe the line, gentlemen!

783
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:44,120
Too slow!

784
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:57,520
You come to the body.
You come to the face.

785
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:00,200
And you move out of the way. When he's
coming around, you get out of the way.

786
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:02,720
They just stand there.
Look at them.

787
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,080
Come on!
Come on, now!

788
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:54,800
- Well, hello there, Joseph.
- Hello, Cara.

789
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:57,080
All done up like a gentleman.

790
01:09:57,080 --> 01:09:59,200
- l hardly recognize him.
- How do you do, ladies?

791
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:11,200
He's a handsome catch,
that Joseph Donelly is.

792
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:15,000
lf he can keep his knuckles up all
night, imagine what his willy can do.

793
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:24,120
Shoes. Secondhand shoes, madam.

794
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:27,880
Would you look at that!

795
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:30,760
Oh, look at the sleeves
all billowed out.

796
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:33,160
lt's from Paris, France,
it says.

797
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:35,360
So beautiful and modern.

798
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:37,160
Excuse me.

799
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:41,960
Well, excuse me.

800
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:44,360
Even her poodle's
putting on airs.

801
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:47,920
Look, Shannon.
There's your famous brother.

802
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:51,160
Good grief.
He's bought himself another hat.

803
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:54,520
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye, Olive.

804
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:01,640
- Hello, Shannon.
- Hello, Joseph.

805
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:03,920
Well, what do you think?

806
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:06,720
Do you like it?
Like my hat?

807
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:08,360
No, not at all.

808
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:12,760
l'll get some other opinions.

809
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:16,960
- Do you like my hat?
- lt's a fine hat.

810
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:20,120
- And a fine fight last night.
- Glad you enjoyed it, Connor.

811
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:24,440
So l left her there,
pulling up her knickers.

812
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:27,720
Hold on a second.
Here he comes.

813
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:30,880
Aye, there's my boy,
looking fit and dandy.

814
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:33,200
- How are you, scrapper?
- Never better, Mike.

815
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:36,040
- Hello, lads.
- Mr. Bourke would like a word with you.

816
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:38,760
Joseph Donelly, still undefeated.

817
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:43,520
- He's a rascal of a holy terror.
- That he is.

818
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:52,160
That's a long-legged piece
of strawberry tart.

819
01:11:55,920 --> 01:12:00,880
- Mind your mouth, Mr. Bourke.
- You don't talk to Mr. Bourke that way.

820
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:02,800
Let it go, Kelly.

821
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:06,640
This is business,
and the boy's our stock in trade.

822
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:10,600
Now listen to me, lad.
There's a man l want you to box.

823
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:14,320
He's a goddamn ltalian,
and l want you to spill his blood.

824
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:17,680
l'll box and l'll win.

825
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:20,280
But you boys don't own me,
Mr. Bourke.

826
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:22,360
l box for myself, alone.

827
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:31,760
What do you think you're doing,
pissing against the wind?

828
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:35,520
D'Arcy Bourke is a powerful man
in Boston, whose connections l need.

829
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:38,880
l'm not gonna kiss the back of his
trousers just 'cause the rest of you do.

830
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:43,000
You like your suit?

831
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,520
Well, do you?

832
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:47,680
You like having a roof over your head?

833
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:50,000
l'm your bread and butter, lad.

834
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,600
Cross me, and you're nothing-

835
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:55,640
nothing but an ignorant mick.

836
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:57,680
You do what you're told
or l'll throw you out on the street...

837
01:12:57,680 --> 01:13:01,880
and every door you'll knock on
will be slammed in your face.

838
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:03,720
Do you understand?

839
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:12,280
Yeah.

840
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:15,040
Good.

841
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:17,160
lt's gonna be a grand fight,
Mr. Bourke.

842
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:19,160
Good. That's what l like to hear.

843
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:33,440
l'm drunk, Joseph!

844
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:38,000
How can you be drunk?
You just left my sight.

845
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:41,040
She's working her way
through a jigger of rye.

846
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:45,360
When l finish it, l may or may not
have another one.

847
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:49,960
Well, Shannon,
you came to America to be modern.

848
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:51,800
l'm glad everything's working out.

849
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:02,840
- You have changed, Mr. Donelly.
- lmproved, you mean.

850
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:05,600
No. Changed.

851
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:08,600
Look at all those silly hats.

852
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:11,000
You'll never get to Oklahoma.
You've spent all your money.

853
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,960
At the rate l'm going,
they'll bring the land to me.

854
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:16,080
You have turned into a snob.

855
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:28,640
Excuse me, drunkard.

856
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:36,200
- Hello, Grace.
- Hello, Joseph.

857
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:38,520
Will l be seeing you
in church tomorrow morn?

858
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:41,280
Sounds divine and holy, Grace.

859
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:43,680
We can share a pew, me and you.

860
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:47,120
- Toodle-oo.
- Same to you.

861
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:51,840
She's got an awfully large chest
to be going to church.

862
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:56,520
Shannon, all chests are equal
in the eyes of the Lord.

863
01:14:56,520 --> 01:15:00,840
She goes into the confession box,
she'll never come out, the little tramp.

864
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:03,640
Grace isn't a tramp.

865
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:05,440
She's a dancer in the burly-cue.

866
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:09,560
That isn't dancing.
That's kicking her knickers up.

867
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:12,360
l suspect if you asked her to,
she'd kick her knickers off.

868
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:17,640
- Well, maybe she would.
- Has she?

869
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:21,480
Let me see.
l'm trying to remember.

870
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:25,480
Well, think hard, if there's
any brain left in your head.

871
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:29,040
Look at you. They're making a fool
of you, the ward boss and his friends.

872
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:33,280
- They respect me.
- They do not. They don't respect you.

873
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:35,560
- Enough.
- You're money in their pockets...

874
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:39,320
- and nothing more, Joseph.
- l said, that's enough, Shannon.

875
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:41,400
You let them pickle you
like a piece of pork.

876
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:44,880
- They're just using you.
- l said that's enough out of you!

877
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:48,240
No! Put me down!

878
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:56,000
Tell me-
Tell me you like my hat.

879
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,200
You're not wearing a hat.

880
01:15:58,200 --> 01:16:01,360
- Say it. Say you like my hat.
- You're not wearing a hat.

881
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:03,000
Say it!

882
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:07,880
Why can't you say it, Shannon?

883
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:11,720
Why can't you say you like my hat?
Why can't you say you like my suit?

884
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:13,360
l've earned it.

885
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:17,560
l've done well.

886
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:35,800
Don't touch me, Joseph.

887
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:38,280
Why don't you go fondle that slut
with the runaway tits?

888
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:40,200
lf she isn't stuffing her face
with pie.

889
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:42,120
You're jealous of me.

890
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:44,240
l make more money than you,
and you're jealous.

891
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:47,880
l can make money as fast as you can.
Just watch me, scrapper!

892
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:01,800
Why don't you shag her
and get it over with?

893
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:06,680
She's my sister.

894
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:08,680
And l'm your mother.

895
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:19,440
Every time your gentleman leaves,
l want you to tidy your room.

896
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:21,720
- Molly.
- l don't want to say that again.

897
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:23,640
- Mike Kelly's looking for you.
- Where's Shannon?

898
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:26,640
- Tonight's the fight- the big fight.
- She didn't come home from work.

899
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:29,120
- The club is crawling with Eye-ties.
- Have you seen her?

900
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:32,280
- No, l haven't.
- She's there. Shannon is there.

901
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:33,640
Where?

902
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,560
- Show 'em how it's done, lad.
- There's the lad!

903
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:41,400
Joseph, for lreland!

904
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:44,560
Dago pigs! You're all the same!

905
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:47,160
We're gonna wipe up the floor
with you!

906
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:49,560
Shannon, stop this!

907
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:53,760
- Where is your dignity woman?
- You mind your business, Joseph.

908
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:56,720
You get your brains smashed in
every night. What's the difference?

909
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:00,400
- There's a world of difference.
- Come on, Donelly.

910
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:01,640
These Eye-ties
are tearing the place apart.

911
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:03,360
- Forget it.
- Get in there and box.

912
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:05,840
- l've got $100 bet on you tonight.
- Kiss it good-bye, Mr. Bourke.

913
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:08,160
l'll make it 200 and l'll
split the winnings with you.

914
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:10,160
Two hundred dollars, Joseph!

915
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:12,560
- What?
- Did you not hear me?

916
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:14,480
l said l'll split the winnings
with you.

917
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:15,720
- No!
- Joseph.

918
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:23,000
- Take it.
- Take it?

919
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:26,280
- l thought you didn't want me to fight.
- But it's so much money.

920
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:29,360
You've boxed for nickels before.
This is a fortune!

921
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:47,680
l'll match that offer.

922
01:18:47,680 --> 01:18:49,600
Don't let your stubborn pride
get in the way.

923
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:51,480
You'll have it-
You'll have Oklahoma.

924
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:53,880
You'll never have to fight
for them again.

925
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:55,920
This'll get us out of here.

926
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:04,440
Us?

927
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:09,240
Well, you.

928
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:13,000
l mean you.

929
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:35,720
That's more like it.
That's a lad!

930
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:51,840
Right, Joseph, damage the dago.
You hear me?

931
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:54,320
Come on, keep back, will you?
Get back. Come on!

932
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:57,000
Fetch Mr. Bourke to the stage.
Get back.

933
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:00,280
This is a fight to the finish,
gentlemen.

934
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:02,960
Side betting is allowed,
and a knockdown terminates a round.

935
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:05,840
Contest grudge, gentlemen.

936
01:20:31,640 --> 01:20:34,400
Come on, scrapper!
Keep your left up!

937
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:39,400
Yes! Go!

938
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:02,320
Dirty dago bastard!

939
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:24,760
Kelly, l smell victory.

940
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:28,120
l'd enjoy it even more
with a little strawberry tart.

941
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:33,480
Mr. Bourke would like some company.

942
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:39,040
l'm not especially attracted
to Mr. Bourke.

943
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:41,520
You came to me for help.
Let's show some manners.

944
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:44,600
Come to scratch!

945
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:11,000
What the hell's he doing?

946
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:14,160
- What are you doing?
- Get your hands off her!

947
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:16,080
There's too much money at stake here.

948
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:19,880
- Filthy pig!
- Get back to scratch!

949
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,240
Do you want to forfeit?

950
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:23,920
- Shannon!
- Let him go!

951
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:27,680
You're losing me money, you coward!

952
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:30,640
Get back in there and fight!
You're gonna forfeit!

953
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:09,480
Go on, Joe!
Get up, Joe!

954
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:28,680
- No!
- Get up, Joseph! Get up!

955
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:31,360
- Come on, Joseph!
- Come on, get up! Get up!

956
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:35,680
Get up! l've bet more money
than you've got! Get up!

957
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:37,480
- Get up!
- He's out!

958
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:06,560
You, get out!
Shut your mouth!

959
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:13,160
Get this loser out of my club.

960
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:11,480
''Social Club Boxing Tonight
lreland Forever''

961
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:13,400
Did you tell them
we're in Jefferson Court?

962
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:15,480
Number Six Jefferson Court.

963
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:17,600
- Six Jefferson Court.
- Make sure they hear you.

964
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:20,480
- ln the South End.
- Her family has come from lreland.

965
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:23,080
They're here in Boston.
They're offering a reward.

966
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:33,920
Have you seen a girl like that?

967
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:40,720
Find her. Do your job.
Must l do everything for you?

968
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:44,560
We found her and here she is,
right over here.

969
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:51,280
We'll never get anything
out of these people.

970
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:53,200
- They're drunks.
- You seen the girl?

971
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:55,760
Her family is in Jefferson Court.

972
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:57,680
Number Six Jefferson Court.

973
01:26:09,480 --> 01:26:12,080
Joseph, what happened to you?

974
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:26,080
Do come in, scrapper.

975
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:34,520
That's our money.
We earned it.

976
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:37,320
There isn't a penny here
doesn't originate with me.

977
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:43,920
Don't touch her!

978
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:52,840
You're done, scrapper. You won't
work here, box here, nothing here.

979
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:55,520
You coppers beat it.
Get him up.

980
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:57,440
Too bad. But l saw it coming...

981
01:26:57,440 --> 01:27:00,040
the first time
you walked in off the boat.

982
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:05,200
No! Leave him!

983
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:12,880
Molly Kay.

984
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:14,800
These two are banished.

985
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:18,440
You shelter them even a night,
l'll shut this whorehouse down.

986
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:21,720
Come on.

987
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:32,360
lt's too cold, Joseph.

988
01:27:34,280 --> 01:27:36,200
- Hey!
- Do you need help, sir?

989
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:38,960
- Get out of here.
- We haven't eaten for three days.

990
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:43,080
- l'll work for food.
- l don't hire lrish.

991
01:27:43,080 --> 01:27:45,680
For the love of God,
we haven't eaten for three days.

992
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:48,760
l said l don't hire lrish.
Now, get out of here!

993
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:07,640
We can't keep wandering like this.

994
01:28:07,640 --> 01:28:09,200
l know.

995
01:28:11,680 --> 01:28:13,600
lt's been so long.

996
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:16,560
Too many days.
We can't keep doing this.

997
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,400
l think this house is empty.

998
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:41,400
Look.

999
01:28:42,640 --> 01:28:45,440
- A tree.
- Look! Food!

1000
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:49,000
There's food here.

1001
01:29:15,640 --> 01:29:17,480
Joseph, look at us.

1002
01:29:22,160 --> 01:29:24,960
l never thought
it would turn out like this.

1003
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:29,160
And we know
there's sweeter land.

1004
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:44,120
Sit down.

1005
01:29:44,120 --> 01:29:46,040
Sit down at this beautiful table.

1006
01:29:46,040 --> 01:29:49,000
No. We can't. We're burglars.

1007
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:53,320
Please. Please.
l want you to pretend.

1008
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:56,400
Sit down.
l'll serve you.

1009
01:29:58,040 --> 01:30:01,600
Tonight l want you to dine.

1010
01:30:28,640 --> 01:30:32,480
No, Joseph. Don't serve me.
Just sit down.

1011
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:34,280
Sit down with me.

1012
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:38,320
Let's pretend...

1013
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:40,520
that this house is ours.

1014
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:45,800
That you're my husband...

1015
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:47,600
and l'm your wife.

1016
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:55,200
Sit down.

1017
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:09,400
Did you ever wonder what that land
you dreamed of looked like?

1018
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:14,280
- Aye.
- Mine-

1019
01:31:14,280 --> 01:31:17,440
Mine was a green pasture
with tall grass...

1020
01:31:17,440 --> 01:31:19,360
that rolled just a little bit.

1021
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:21,560
Mine had a stream
running through it.

1022
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,120
Perhaps some trees.

1023
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:27,040
Rich, dark soil.

1024
01:31:28,280 --> 01:31:30,480
No rocks to pick out of the ground.

1025
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:34,880
Green pasture and a stream.

1026
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:36,920
They would complement
each other, no?

1027
01:31:38,160 --> 01:31:41,040
They would.

1028
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:43,800
The one, in fact...

1029
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:45,640
depends upon the other.

1030
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:50,520
Pretend...

1031
01:31:50,520 --> 01:31:52,560
you love me.

1032
01:31:53,320 --> 01:31:55,120
l'll pretend l love you.

1033
01:31:57,920 --> 01:32:00,320
l'll pretend l love you too.

1034
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:38,760
- What was that?
- Who's there?

1035
01:32:48,760 --> 01:32:50,760
Get the hell out of my house!

1036
01:32:59,480 --> 01:33:02,160
Police! Police!

1037
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:04,080
Get the police!

1038
01:33:18,080 --> 01:33:19,160
Help!

1039
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:25,480
This girl needs help!
Will you let us in?

1040
01:33:25,480 --> 01:33:27,400
This-

1041
01:33:33,720 --> 01:33:36,600
ls this the Christies'?

1042
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:44,280
Just let us in.

1043
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:54,520
- Quickly, fetch a doctor.
- Yes, sir.

1044
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:58,960
Step aside. You'll infect her
with your filthy hands.

1045
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:01,640
What did you expect?
That you could climb to her station?

1046
01:34:03,640 --> 01:34:06,720
- Gunshot!
- Aye.

1047
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:13,800
God, look at her.

1048
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:17,760
- Will she be all right?
- She will now.

1049
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:20,800
The wound is in the shoulder.
l have to clean it.

1050
01:34:47,960 --> 01:34:50,360
Shannon, l-

1051
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:58,480
You're safe now...

1052
01:34:58,480 --> 01:35:00,320
in this house.

1053
01:35:04,080 --> 01:35:06,080
You're gonna be fine.

1054
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:21,240
Take care of her.

1055
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:44,640
Mr. Christie, here's the doctor.

1056
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:47,120
- Something terrible has happened.
- What is it, Doctor?

1057
01:35:47,120 --> 01:35:49,440
- Your daughter, Mr. Christie.
- Shannon? She's here?

1058
01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:51,240
What's happened to her?

1059
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:26,840
All right, she's all clear!
Let's get the mud cleaned out.

1060
01:36:26,920 --> 01:36:30,480
Hey, mick, after you drop that tile,
let's get after these rocks.

1061
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:35,560
Come on! Let's get some goddamn work
done here. Fill up that wheel barrow.

1062
01:36:40,240 --> 01:36:42,360
Come on, fill it up.
Fill it up.

1063
01:37:19,960 --> 01:37:23,600
Move it! Hey!
Fire in the hole!

1064
01:37:26,200 --> 01:37:29,760
Come on, boys, find yourself some cover.
We got fire in the hole!

1065
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:32,720
Hey, you!
Fire in the hole!

1066
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:15,280
Water!

1067
01:38:16,240 --> 01:38:18,160
Anybody need water?

1068
01:38:19,240 --> 01:38:21,040
Water?

1069
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:27,960
Look at that. All them wagons headed
for the Oklahoma Territory.

1070
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:31,200
l'd be going wit them
if l was as young as you.

1071
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:33,040
Doesn't interest me.

1072
01:38:51,640 --> 01:38:53,840
l had a woman once.

1073
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:56,360
But she didn't want me
'cause l had no money.

1074
01:38:56,360 --> 01:39:00,080
That's America.
Unless you're rich, you're nobody.

1075
01:39:00,080 --> 01:39:03,160
l should never have come
to this place.

1076
01:39:03,160 --> 01:39:07,360
Forget the women, boys.
You got a job of work ahead of you.

1077
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:34,240
Da, is that you?

1078
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:39,120
Oh, you look like you're
not doing too well, my boy.

1079
01:39:39,120 --> 01:39:41,040
l missed you, Da.

1080
01:39:43,720 --> 01:39:46,480
A man is nothing
without land, they say.

1081
01:39:49,280 --> 01:39:53,120
Land is a man's own soul.

1082
01:39:56,560 --> 01:39:58,480
l'll work my own land someday.

1083
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:04,320
lf you manage it, by God,
your old Da...

1084
01:40:04,320 --> 01:40:08,000
will be smiling down on you
from heaven above.

1085
01:40:12,760 --> 01:40:16,320
Stay where you are, boys.
We're just stopping for water.

1086
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:18,240
Oh, look.
lt's the pioneers.

1087
01:40:19,600 --> 01:40:23,320
They go to Oklahoma, l think...

1088
01:40:23,320 --> 01:40:25,440
for the free land.

1089
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:31,200
They're just wasting time.
There ain't enough land to go around.

1090
01:40:34,640 --> 01:40:37,040
One in a hundred
will stake a claim.

1091
01:40:37,040 --> 01:40:38,960
The rest of 'em-

1092
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:41,560
they just dreaming.

1093
01:40:41,560 --> 01:40:43,640
Think they gonna get
some free land.

1094
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:54,000
Hey, lrish!

1095
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:58,720
Hey, mick, where do you think
you're going?

1096
01:40:58,720 --> 01:41:00,720
l was on the wrong road!

1097
01:42:11,320 --> 01:42:14,280
There now!
Coming through!

1098
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:19,840
- Coming through!
- Farmers, ranchers, homesteaders!

1099
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:21,760
This well-driller is an example...

1100
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:24,560
of modern American industry
at its finest.

1101
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:28,000
Come up and have a look.
lt's not gonna bite. lt's just modern.

1102
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,400
You may find land tomorrow,
but you won't survive...

1103
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:32,400
in the wilderness,
not without water.

1104
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:36,160
''Land Office''

1105
01:42:41,160 --> 01:42:44,400
Folks, each quarter section
is marked.

1106
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:50,160
You run for land, remove the marker
and drive in your own stake.

1107
01:42:50,160 --> 01:42:53,400
The race begins tomorrow at noon.

1108
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:56,600
Again, each quarter section is marked.

1109
01:42:56,600 --> 01:43:00,400
- You run for land-
- Where can l get a horse?

1110
01:43:02,320 --> 01:43:04,640
Well, you're a little late,
cowboy.

1111
01:43:04,640 --> 01:43:06,840
Pickings are slim.

1112
01:43:06,840 --> 01:43:11,240
Now, this here horse is broke.

1113
01:43:11,240 --> 01:43:14,800
That horse there-
green broke.

1114
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:16,920
Know the difference?

1115
01:43:16,920 --> 01:43:18,840
Think l can see it.

1116
01:43:20,160 --> 01:43:23,920
A broke horse
is a dependable horse.

1117
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:27,160
A green broke horse-
he's faster.

1118
01:43:28,720 --> 01:43:31,000
That sounds good.
The faster, the better.

1119
01:43:31,680 --> 01:43:33,320
No telling what he'll do though.

1120
01:43:33,320 --> 01:43:36,280
Hell, you could end up in Canada
on that green broke son of a bitch.

1121
01:43:37,240 --> 01:43:38,480
Stand back!

1122
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:47,800
l think l'll take
the dependable horse.

1123
01:43:47,800 --> 01:43:49,040
l would.

1124
01:43:49,040 --> 01:43:51,720
You go out and get you a good piece
of land tomorrow now, Joseph.

1125
01:43:51,720 --> 01:43:53,080
Thank you, Ralph.

1126
01:44:23,560 --> 01:44:26,040
l'm cursed.

1127
01:44:26,040 --> 01:44:28,160
Oh, Lord, l'm cursed.

1128
01:44:38,920 --> 01:44:41,600
Mother, the clothes will never come
clean if you don't get your hands wet.

1129
01:44:43,800 --> 01:44:47,160
There's no order
in this godforsaken place.

1130
01:44:47,160 --> 01:44:51,960
Here. Take the soap
and you plunge and scrub.

1131
01:44:51,960 --> 01:44:54,080
- ''Plunge and scrub''?
- Like so.

1132
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:59,800
Nora!

1133
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:01,240
l've been shot.

1134
01:45:01,240 --> 01:45:02,680
Shot?

1135
01:45:02,680 --> 01:45:05,280
Well, shot at, anyway...

1136
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:07,480
by the cavalry.

1137
01:45:07,480 --> 01:45:11,320
We crossed the starting line
and we broke the law.

1138
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:14,600
Daniel Christie, l will not have you
riding tomorrow...

1139
01:45:14,600 --> 01:45:17,360
in that vulgarity of a race.

1140
01:45:17,360 --> 01:45:20,360
The wild west suits me, Nora.

1141
01:45:20,360 --> 01:45:22,360
There's no telling what l might do.

1142
01:45:29,360 --> 01:45:32,120
Shannon, l found it!

1143
01:45:32,120 --> 01:45:35,680
Twenty miles straight west of here.
lt's paradise itself.

1144
01:45:35,680 --> 01:45:38,760
You will love it.
The earth is dry and dusty here...

1145
01:45:38,760 --> 01:45:41,840
but where we'll live
there's a winding stream...

1146
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:45,560
and the grass on the gentle hills
around it grows high and rich and green.

1147
01:45:47,200 --> 01:45:49,600
lt's the plot of land
you've dreamed of.

1148
01:45:52,200 --> 01:45:54,000
Excuse me, Stephen.

1149
01:45:56,600 --> 01:45:59,840
- Are you cross with me?
- Of course l am.

1150
01:45:59,840 --> 01:46:01,880
We were doing this together,
l thought.

1151
01:46:01,880 --> 01:46:04,360
l couldn't take you with me today.
lt was too dangerous.

1152
01:46:04,360 --> 01:46:06,360
l don't mind a little danger
now and then.

1153
01:46:06,360 --> 01:46:08,960
Stop this childishness.

1154
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:12,600
Are we not here, your parents and l,
because you wanted this?

1155
01:46:12,600 --> 01:46:16,440
Tomorrow we'll ride as one,
together, side by side.

1156
01:46:16,440 --> 01:46:18,840
We'll claim our land,
and then we'll marry...

1157
01:46:18,840 --> 01:46:21,240
and finally settle down.

1158
01:46:25,840 --> 01:46:27,840
You do want to settle down,
don't you, Shannon?

1159
01:46:30,640 --> 01:46:32,560
Yes.

1160
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:34,960
Yes, l want to settle down.

1161
01:46:37,080 --> 01:46:40,320
There now. That's better.

1162
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:44,840
l hate to see you angry.

1163
01:46:46,760 --> 01:46:48,880
lt isn't your nature to be so.

1164
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:01,440
Hello, Shannon.

1165
01:47:14,760 --> 01:47:19,080
l wondered if l'd see you here.
l suspected that l might.

1166
01:47:20,400 --> 01:47:24,160
That's right. l saw you living
back in Boston all this while.

1167
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:32,960
You look well. Well.

1168
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:36,640
l'm here with my family.

1169
01:47:36,640 --> 01:47:39,480
We came by train.

1170
01:47:39,480 --> 01:47:40,840
l came by train myself.

1171
01:47:42,280 --> 01:47:45,720
You'll be running in the race
tomorrow, l presume.

1172
01:47:45,720 --> 01:47:49,000
l always said l'd get my land.

1173
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,880
l even bought a horse.
A fine horse.

1174
01:48:05,120 --> 01:48:06,640
Well-

1175
01:48:08,360 --> 01:48:10,280
Time takes care of everything,
doesn't it?

1176
01:48:13,240 --> 01:48:15,840
Everything's worked out...

1177
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:18,440
as it should have.

1178
01:48:18,440 --> 01:48:19,480
Don't you agree?

1179
01:48:25,160 --> 01:48:26,200
Yeah.

1180
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:31,000
Good luck tomorrow, Joseph.

1181
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:32,440
Aye.

1182
01:48:33,760 --> 01:48:36,960
Best of luck to you, Shannon.

1183
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:54,000
Shannon Christie!

1184
01:48:57,280 --> 01:48:59,080
You never gave up.

1185
01:49:00,640 --> 01:49:03,600
You knew what you wanted
back in lreland.

1186
01:49:03,600 --> 01:49:06,400
And look at ya.
Here ya are.

1187
01:49:12,040 --> 01:49:13,960
You're a corker, Shannon.

1188
01:49:15,880 --> 01:49:17,720
What a corker you are.

1189
01:49:44,640 --> 01:49:46,960
Beautiful country, isn't it, boy?

1190
01:49:48,280 --> 01:49:51,480
l found the perfect piece of land
for Shannon and me.

1191
01:49:51,480 --> 01:49:53,960
Almost a picture
of what she described.

1192
01:49:53,960 --> 01:49:56,440
The land of her dreams.

1193
01:49:56,440 --> 01:49:58,360
Congratulations.

1194
01:50:00,280 --> 01:50:02,880
Just what the hell
are you doing here?

1195
01:50:03,360 --> 01:50:06,440
You bring her to me bleeding,
and now you think you can talk to her?

1196
01:50:06,440 --> 01:50:09,000
Stay away from her.
Do you hear me?

1197
01:50:10,360 --> 01:50:13,240
There'll be a lot of confusion
in the race tomorrow, lad.

1198
01:50:13,240 --> 01:50:14,960
Someone could get shot.

1199
01:50:42,880 --> 01:50:47,360
Her beautiful eyes

1200
01:50:47,360 --> 01:50:51,000
Were a terrible curse

1201
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:54,480
Three days in his grave

1202
01:50:54,480 --> 01:50:58,600
She ran off with his purse

1203
01:50:58,600 --> 01:51:03,000
They've got their land all picked out,
the pair of them.

1204
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:06,560
The land of her dreams.
All those months...

1205
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:10,200
l was trying to forget about her.

1206
01:51:12,200 --> 01:51:16,520
l was laying down the very track
that brought her here.

1207
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:23,440
To hell with everyone.

1208
01:51:23,440 --> 01:51:27,840
l'm gonna get my land.
That's my thought for the night.

1209
01:51:27,840 --> 01:51:30,040
Tomorrow l ride for me.

1210
01:51:30,040 --> 01:51:31,960
Me alone.

1211
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:35,320
And my horse.

1212
01:51:51,520 --> 01:51:54,520
Sweet Mary and Jesus...

1213
01:51:54,520 --> 01:51:56,520
and all the saints preserve us.

1214
01:51:58,920 --> 01:52:03,040
That there was the oldest horse
l ever saw in my life.

1215
01:52:57,880 --> 01:53:01,360
lt's almost noon.
We're gonna miss the photograph.

1216
01:53:01,360 --> 01:53:03,160
All right. Ready?

1217
01:53:17,960 --> 01:53:20,520
l sold him that horse.

1218
01:53:20,520 --> 01:53:22,720
Don't let him bluff you, cowboy!

1219
01:53:31,280 --> 01:53:34,240
We're breaking the law, Nora.

1220
01:53:34,240 --> 01:53:36,360
l don't like you taking charge
of the business side of our life.

1221
01:53:36,360 --> 01:53:39,320
Oh, you do too.
Now, listen up.

1222
01:53:39,320 --> 01:53:42,200
This stake goes into the ground
over there.

1223
01:53:42,200 --> 01:53:44,120
That's your job.
l'll tell you when.

1224
01:53:44,120 --> 01:53:47,000
l, meanwhile,
will run the horse around in circles.

1225
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
He's got to look
all sweaty and tired.

1226
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:52,480
- Even dead would be good. Got it?
- Yes.

1227
01:53:52,480 --> 01:53:56,000
But we don't really need
all of this.

1228
01:53:57,160 --> 01:53:58,800
lt's scary out here, Daniel.

1229
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:02,240
Ah, we'll do fine.
Pretend we're starting out in life...

1230
01:54:02,240 --> 01:54:03,600
instead of ending up.

1231
01:54:23,560 --> 01:54:25,560
Anyone buy a good pair of spurs?

1232
01:54:28,520 --> 01:54:29,600
Sorry.

1233
01:54:33,600 --> 01:54:35,920
The race is that way, lad.

1234
01:54:48,880 --> 01:54:51,440
Forget the horse, lad...

1235
01:54:51,440 --> 01:54:53,560
and find yourself a donkey.

1236
01:55:01,320 --> 01:55:02,680
Take him by the bit.

1237
01:55:39,600 --> 01:55:41,240
Where the hell is he going?

1238
01:55:42,480 --> 01:55:43,720
Shoot him!

1239
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:54,360
Fire!

1240
01:56:29,080 --> 01:56:30,440
Get up!

1241
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:53,920
That way!

1242
01:57:01,600 --> 01:57:03,600
l have no wish to fight you.

1243
01:59:31,280 --> 01:59:33,520
God protect us!
Daniel, here they come!

1244
01:59:35,520 --> 01:59:39,840
Stand by, partner,
and pretend you're out of breath.

1245
01:59:39,840 --> 01:59:43,560
Pretend? My heart's
up here in my nose.

1246
01:59:46,440 --> 01:59:49,040
Oh, my God, Nora.
Oh, this is thrilling.

1247
01:59:49,040 --> 01:59:52,400
Nora! Now, Nora! Now!

1248
02:01:08,240 --> 02:01:10,080
There it is!

1249
02:01:11,440 --> 02:01:13,320
Come on!

1250
02:01:37,120 --> 02:01:39,320
Come on, Shannon!
Hurry!

1251
02:01:44,680 --> 02:01:46,520
Come on. Come on.

1252
02:01:58,600 --> 02:02:00,240
Get up!
Grab the reins!

1253
02:02:08,680 --> 02:02:10,600
Are you all right, Shannon?

1254
02:02:15,600 --> 02:02:18,440
Go, Joseph. Go.

1255
02:02:21,320 --> 02:02:23,160
Ride!

1256

You're not in lreland anymore...

1258
02:02:53,160 --> 02:02:55,680
you arrogant bastard.

1259
02:02:58,160 --> 02:03:00,760
Damn it, Shannon. Do you want
your land or don't you?

1260
02:03:22,720 --> 02:03:25,320
This land is mine!

1261
02:03:25,320 --> 02:03:27,600
Mine by destiny!

1262
02:03:53,680 --> 02:03:56,680
Go ahead, Joseph.
Claim it.

1263
02:03:56,680 --> 02:04:00,520
- Shannon. Claim it.
- Stephen!

1264
02:04:00,680 --> 02:04:03,080
Look out, Joseph!

1265
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,400
Oh, my God!

1266
02:04:22,760 --> 02:04:24,760
- Joseph!
- Don't touch him!

1267
02:04:24,760 --> 02:04:26,400
- Get away!
- Listen to me!

1268
02:04:26,400 --> 02:04:29,480
Get away, Stephen!
Leave!

1269
02:04:34,720 --> 02:04:37,040
Joseph, look at me.

1270
02:04:37,040 --> 02:04:38,280
Look at me.

1271
02:04:38,280 --> 02:04:41,160
No, don't move.
Stay still.

1272
02:04:46,160 --> 02:04:48,840
Don't do this.

1273
02:04:52,680 --> 02:04:56,800
- You've made your choice.
- Joseph, look at me.

1274
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:00,920
Look at me. Look at me.

1275
02:05:00,920 --> 02:05:05,120
- Joseph, look at me.
- l feel myself dying.

1276
02:05:05,120 --> 02:05:08,200
No, you stay looking at my eyes.
Look at my eyes, Joseph.

1277
02:05:08,200 --> 02:05:10,320
- Shannon.
- No, you're not dying.

1278
02:05:10,320 --> 02:05:13,000
Look, you've got your land.

1279
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:16,840
But all the land in the world
means nothing to me without you.

1280
02:05:22,800 --> 02:05:25,680
l tried to prove myself to you...

1281
02:05:25,680 --> 02:05:29,960
but l know nothing of books,
alphabets...

1282
02:05:29,960 --> 02:05:33,720
or sun or moon or-

1283
02:05:34,960 --> 02:05:37,360
All l know...

1284
02:05:37,360 --> 02:05:40,720
is Joseph loves Shannon.

1285
02:05:47,440 --> 02:05:49,840
That's all that matters to me.

1286
02:06:02,400 --> 02:06:04,600
No, stay with me. Stay.

1287
02:06:07,760 --> 02:06:09,680
Joseph, look at me.

1288
02:06:10,640 --> 02:06:12,360
Joseph, please.

1289
02:06:12,360 --> 02:06:14,960
Please, don't leave me.

1290
02:06:14,960 --> 02:06:17,240
Please, don't leave me alone.

1291
02:06:29,360 --> 02:06:31,160
Please.

1292
02:06:33,080 --> 02:06:36,160
No, please, God in heaven,
please.

1293
02:06:36,160 --> 02:06:37,960
Don't leave me.

1294
02:06:43,520 --> 02:06:46,600
This is our dream together.

1295
02:06:46,600 --> 02:06:49,960
l don't want this
without you.

1296
02:06:57,840 --> 02:07:00,520
l loved you.

1297
02:07:00,520 --> 02:07:04,080
l loved you
from the first time l saw you.

1298
02:07:15,280 --> 02:07:17,200
l often wondered about that.

1299
02:07:22,960 --> 02:07:25,640
You died. You died.

1300
02:07:31,200 --> 02:07:34,560
But you could be sure
l won't be dying twice.
