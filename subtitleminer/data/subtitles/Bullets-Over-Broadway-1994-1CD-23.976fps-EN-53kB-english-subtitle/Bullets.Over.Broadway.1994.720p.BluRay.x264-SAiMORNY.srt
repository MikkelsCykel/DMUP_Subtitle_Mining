I'm an artist, and I won't change
a word of my play...

17
00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:48,636
to pander to some commercial
Broadway audience!

18
00:01:48,713 --> 00:01:51,804
I'm not arguing with you!
Do you see me arguing?

19
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,505
Your play is great as is. It's real.
It makes a point. It's confrontational.

20
00:01:55,579 --> 00:01:59,034
- Then why won't you produce it?
- Because I cannot afford
another failure.

21
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,371
- David, the play's too heavy.
- But not everybody writes to distract.

22
00:02:02,447 --> 00:02:05,277
- [ Groans ]
- It's the theater's duty
not just to entertain...

23
00:02:05,347 --> 00:02:07,835
- but to transform men's souls.
- Oh, come on.

24
00:02:07,913 --> 00:02:11,311
You're not at one of your sidewalk cafes
in Greenwich Village. This is Broadway.

25
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:14,073
- You said you believed in my play!
- What do you want me to say?

26
00:02:14,314 --> 00:02:17,575
I'm tapped out. Maybe if we got some
big-time director interested...

27
00:02:17,646 --> 00:02:20,840
- I could scare up backers--
- No, no, no. I'm directing this play.

28
00:02:20,913 --> 00:02:23,970
Ohh, will you listen to this guy?
Where's your track record?

29
00:02:24,047 --> 00:02:26,740
I won't see my work mangled again.
I've been through this twice before.

30
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,745
Two powerful scripts,
could have been tremendous successes...

31
00:02:29,813 --> 00:02:34,337
and I had to watch actors change
my dialogue and directors
misinterpret everything!

32
00:02:34,414 --> 00:02:36,346
I know. I know.
You're an artist.

33
00:02:36,414 --> 00:02:41,346
Let me tell you, kid, that's the
real world out there, and it's
a lot rougher than you think.

- I feel like eatin' ribs.
- That's a good idea.

I gotta go shoot crap at Tommy's. He's
got a game at the Ansonia. I gotta go.

41
00:03:10,447 --> 00:03:14,038
Somebody's got to let
Mr. Valenti know what's going on.
He's at the Three Deuces.

42

- Why don't you go tell him?
- I promised Bobby Doyle.
I can't do nothin'.

00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:22,835
- I gotta shoot a game.
- What's a matter, Cheech? Don't
you wanna baby-sit his girl?

- I'll open it. Here. Hey.

do you think they are?

- These are black pearls.

Don't give me that!
I never heard of black pearls.

86
00:05:48,646 --> 00:05:51,272
Just 'cause you never heard of somethin'
don't mean it don't exist.

of chump? They're black, for God's sake.

from defective oysters.

why don't you get me out

You will, baby. You'll be a great

[ David ] I'm telling you,
they read my play, they love it.
But they're afraid of it.

- [ Man ] It's irrelevant.
- It's not irrelevant!

98
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,912
The point
I'm making is that...

99
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:40,503
no truly great artist has ever
been appreciated in his lifetime.

100
00:06:40,579 --> 00:06:42,545
- Not one?
- No, no.

101
00:06:42,579 --> 00:06:47,841
- Flender.
- Take, uh, uh... Van Gogh
or Edgar Allen Poe.

102
00:06:47,913 --> 00:06:51,811
Poe died poor and freezing
with his cat curled on his feet.

103
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,438
David, don't give up on it.
Maybe it'll be produced posthumously.

104
00:06:55,513 --> 00:06:59,469
You know, I-I-I have never
had a play produced-- That's right.

105
00:06:59,546 --> 00:07:03,638
- And I've written one play every
year for the past 20 years.
- That's because you're a genius.

106
00:07:03,713 --> 00:07:07,476
The proof is that both common
people and intellectuals find
your work completely incoherent.

107
00:07:07,546 --> 00:07:10,842
- It means you're a genius.
- We all have our moments of doubt.

108
00:07:10,913 --> 00:07:16,812
I paint a canvas every week, take one
look at it and slash it with a razor.

109
00:07:16,846 --> 00:07:20,676
- Well, in your case that's a good idea.
- I have faith in your plays.

110
00:07:20,713 --> 00:07:24,509
- She has faith in my plays
because she loves me.
- Also because you're a genius.

111
00:07:24,579 --> 00:07:27,511
Ten years ago, I-I-I kidnapped
this woman from a very beautiful...

112
00:07:27,579 --> 00:07:30,841
middle-class life in Pittsburgh, and
I made her life miserable ever since.

113
00:07:30,913 --> 00:07:33,902
Hey, Ellen, as long
as he's a good man, keep him.

114
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:37,844
You know, I think the mistake
we women make is we fall
in love with the artist--

115
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,846
- Hey, you guys, are you listening?
- Yes, yes.

116
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,539
- We fall in love with
the artist, not the man.
- I don't think that's a mistake.

117
00:07:42,613 --> 00:07:45,045
- How is that a mistake?
- [ Woman ] The artist makes the man.

118
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,303
She's right. You can't
separate 'em. No, look. Say
there was a burning building...

119
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:52,675
and you could rush in, and
you could save only one thing:

120
00:07:52,713 --> 00:07:57,805
either the last known copy
of Shakespeare's plays or
some anonymous human being.

121
00:07:57,846 --> 00:07:59,903
- You cannot--
- What would you do?

122
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,469
- You cannot deprive the world
of those plays.
- Correct.

123
00:08:02,546 --> 00:08:04,944
- Phone call, David.
- [ Girl ] It's an inanimate object.

124
00:08:05,013 --> 00:08:09,775
It's not an inanimate object!
It's art! Art is life! It lives!

125
00:08:09,846 --> 00:08:12,778
We got the money.
We can do the play.

126
00:08:12,813 --> 00:08:15,506
What? When? How?

127
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:18,545
A single backer
goin' for the whole show.

128
00:08:18,613 --> 00:08:21,807
An old acquaintance. I'm up
at the Cotton Club. I ran into him.

129
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:25,313
- And no hitches?
- Well, uh--

130
00:08:25,347 --> 00:08:29,574
We'll meet tomorrow and discuss it,
all right? Luxor Baths. Noon.

131
00:08:31,414 --> 00:08:35,778
Are you nuts? You think I'm gonna let
some amateur play the lead in my play?

132
00:08:35,846 --> 00:08:38,472
Did I say "lead"?
Did I say "lead," Mr. Genius?

133
00:08:38,513 --> 00:08:41,638
- Some guy's girlfriend 'cause
he's puttin' up the money?
- Did I say "lead"?

134
00:08:41,713 --> 00:08:44,645
I said a part, a role.
I thought maybe Dr. Philips.

135
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,805
- The psychiatrist? It's a key role.
- What key role?

136
00:08:47,846 --> 00:08:51,006
- It's a small part. Key role!
- Who is this woman anyway?

137
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,705
Olive Neal? I don't even know what
she looks like, much less can she act.

138
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:57,746
He says she's the stuff
that stars are made of.

139
00:08:57,813 --> 00:09:00,711
That's 'cause he's in love with her.
And who is he anyway?

140
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:05,270
- His name is Nick Valenti.
- How-How-- How do I know
that name? What's he do?

141
00:09:05,347 --> 00:09:08,710
- Ah, he's got his finger
in a number of pies.
- I don't like the sound of this.

142
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:11,837
- Look, you wanna
get your play on or not?
- I gotta meet her first.

143
00:09:11,913 --> 00:09:14,004
- So you'll meet her.
- I'm conflicted.

144
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,807
-You'll meet her. That's all I'm saying.
-The psychiatrist is not small.

145
00:09:17,846 --> 00:09:22,801
It's not the lead. It's-- It's a
small part. Who do you see in the lead?

146
00:09:22,846 --> 00:09:25,676
- I don't know.
- What about Helen Sinclair?

147
00:09:25,746 --> 00:09:29,644
Oh, sure. I mean, she'd be great.
But can we get her?

148
00:09:29,713 --> 00:09:32,475
Why can't we get her? She's been in
nothin' but flops the past three years.

149
00:09:32,546 --> 00:09:34,479
Yeah, but she's
a major actress.

150
00:09:34,513 --> 00:09:36,672
[ Chuckles ]
Was.

151
00:09:36,746 --> 00:09:39,610
She'd be great.
I mean, really, she's brilliant.

152
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,942
- She possess the necessary fire.
For the part, she'd be great.
- You really think so?

153
00:09:43,013 --> 00:09:45,706
- I'm glad you think so.
- Think we can get her?

154
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:49,678
- I sent the script
to her agent, Sidney Loomis.
- You did?

155
00:09:49,746 --> 00:09:53,372
- Did I do wrong? Did I do wrong?
- No, no.

156
00:09:53,447 --> 00:09:56,072
- Did I do wrong not checking
with you first?
- Not at all.

157
00:09:56,314 --> 00:09:59,007
- If so, I stand corrected. I mean that.
- No, really.

158
00:09:59,047 --> 00:10:02,740
- Helen Sinclair... really.
- Get it out.

159
00:10:02,813 --> 00:10:06,371
- She's great.
- Well, all we can do
is hope for the best.

160
00:10:06,447 --> 00:10:09,537
You must be joking!

161
00:10:09,613 --> 00:10:14,602
You want me to play some frumpy
housewife who gets dumped for a flapper?

162
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,806
Don't you remember who I am?
Don't you know who you represent?

163
00:10:18,846 --> 00:10:22,835
- I'm Helen Sinclair!
- Definitely! You are
definitely Helen Sinclair.

164
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:27,572
I look at you and I say Helen Sinclair!
But who better to play that role?

165
00:10:27,646 --> 00:10:30,408
- Under whose direction? Some novice!
- He's the author.

166
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,071
- Of two flops.
- Julian says it was the directors
that messed up those projects.

167
00:10:34,314 --> 00:10:39,837
Julian Marx! I do plays put on
by Belasco or Sam Harris.

168
00:10:39,913 --> 00:10:43,346
Not some Yiddish pants salesman
turned producer.

169
00:10:43,414 --> 00:10:47,675
My ex-husband used to say,
"lf you're gonna go down,
go down with the best of them."

170
00:10:47,746 --> 00:10:51,440
- Which ex-husband?
- Oh, I don't know which ex-husband.
The one with the moustache.

171
00:10:51,513 --> 00:10:54,809
Listen to me. Authors are very often
the best directors of their own works.

172
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,005
She's dowdy! Sid, the ingenue
has all the hot lines.

173
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,671
Even the female psychiatrist
is a better role.

174
00:11:00,746 --> 00:11:03,712
But the role of Sylvia Poston
is the lead.

175
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:08,644
Sylvia Poston.
Even the name reeks of Orbach's!

176
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:12,374
I do Electra!
I do Lady Macbeth!

177
00:11:12,447 --> 00:11:17,708
I do plays by Noel and Phil Barry
or at least Max Anderson.

178
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:22,406
Helen, listen to me. This is
a major part in a serious play.

179
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,968
And let's face it, Helen. You have
not been in a hit in a long time.

180
00:11:26,013 --> 00:11:30,036
- In a long, long, long time.
- I'm still a star!

181
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,412
I never play
frumps or virgins.

182
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,843
You're a star because you're great,
and you are a great star.

183
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,846
- But let me tell you somethin'.
- [ Bell Rings ]

184
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,846
In the last couple of years...

185
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,573
you're better known as an adulteress and
a drunk-- I say this in all due respect.

186
00:11:43,646 --> 00:11:46,010
I haven't had a drink
since New Year's Eve.

187
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:48,013
- We're talkin' Chinese New Year's.
- Naturally.

188
00:11:48,047 --> 00:11:50,638
Still, that's two days, Sid.
You know how long that is for me?

189
00:11:50,713 --> 00:11:53,271
- What is it, Josette?
- [ Woman ] Some flowers.

190
00:11:53,347 --> 00:11:55,313
Well, bring them here,
will you?

191
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:58,540
The offers are not pourin' in
like they used to.

192
00:11:58,613 --> 00:12:01,045
They're from David Shayne.

193
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,905
"As a small artist to a greater one.
That you merely consider my play...

194
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:08,469
is all the fulfillment
I require.

195
00:12:08,513 --> 00:12:10,480
Hmm.

196
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:17,312
- What's he like?
- I hear he's terrific.
A genius ready to emerge.

197
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:20,641
- I have to be billed over the title.
- Where else?

198
00:12:20,713 --> 00:12:25,271
- Approval of the leading man.
The star's dressing room.
- This is not even a question.

199
00:12:25,347 --> 00:12:27,744
Approval of
all photos of me.

200
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:30,336
Oh, it's still not
a very glamorous role.

201
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:34,278
But maybe I could meet with David.
Maybe we could go over the script.

202
00:12:34,347 --> 00:12:38,302
Maybe there's a few ways
we could find to brighten her up. Hmm?

203
00:12:38,347 --> 00:12:40,438
Why am I nervous?

204
00:12:41,713 --> 00:12:45,645
- That was sad. Clara Bow had it rough.
- She's a doll.

205
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,635
- I'd do anything to be in a movie.
- You're pretty enough.

206
00:12:49,713 --> 00:12:53,077
Do you think you could
ever speak to Mr. Valenti?

207
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:55,871
- Mr. Valenti knows everybody.
He'll do the right thing.
- That's right.

208
00:12:55,946 --> 00:12:59,537
I hear he's gonna make Olive Neal
a Broadway star. [ Screams ]

209
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:03,444
[ Gunshots ]

210
00:13:06,813 --> 00:13:09,473
Go, go, go!

211
00:13:09,546 --> 00:13:11,910
Where'd it happen?

212
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:15,469
Who'd they get?
Oh, Jesus!

213
00:13:15,513 --> 00:13:18,707
All right, I'm gonna be
at Olive's for about an hour.

214
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:22,008
You get some more guys downstairs
and call me back on the Masucci thing.

215
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,274
-This is for Leo Kustabeck, you hear me?
-[ Olive ] Hey!

216
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:29,279
- You said this was the lead.
It's a smaller part.
- All right.

217
00:13:29,347 --> 00:13:31,972
- I got no time now.
- It's a smaller part.
I don't believe it.

218
00:13:32,047 --> 00:13:34,979
- They just got Vinny and Sal
outside a movie house.
- I counted the lines.

219
00:13:35,013 --> 00:13:38,877
- Sylvia Poston is the lead.
I'm just backing her up.
- You hear what I said?

220
00:13:38,946 --> 00:13:43,470
- I'm tired of backing people up.
I wanna be the lead.
- Julian says you're a doctor.

221
00:13:43,513 --> 00:13:47,310
- A doctor. I don't wanna be
a doctor. I wanna be the lead.
- A head doctor. It's a big part.

222
00:13:47,347 --> 00:13:50,006
A head doctor,
but it ain't the lead.

223
00:13:50,047 --> 00:13:52,706
- So don't try and snow me.
- You'd squawk if they
hung you with a new rope.

224
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:55,769
- I know a lead when I see a lead,
and this ain't the lead.
- [ Phone Ringing ]

225
00:13:55,846 --> 00:13:59,472

A lead has lots of scenes.
- Hello? Oh, Vito.

together at the garage.
- I don't get to kiss nobody.

What is it with you?
- Hey!

- You wanna take your business
outta here? We got guests!
- Call me back.

- I got trouble here.
- I don't care about your trouble.

- What am I supposed to do?
Just foot the bills around here?
- I don't care.

this Broadway big shot too.

- Listen. When they get here...
- What?

235
00:14:33,047 --> 00:14:36,343
- charm 'em a little, baby.
- You're the one that
needs charm lessons.

236

- I told them you're a great actress.
- I am a great actress.

She thinks it's great.
- Yes, I read your play.

00:14:53,646 --> 00:14:56,442
It's thrilling, turbulent,
a page turner.

Charmed, charmed,
charmed, charmed.

244

She's a great little actress.
Just needs a break.

- What have you been in, Miss, uh--
- Olive. Olive. Olive.

- Call me Olive, honey.

- No.

- Honey, honey. Yes, I have acted.

00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:53,038
I have acted. I've acted a lot.
I was in a musical revue.
Can you light this for me?

Geez. No manners.
No gentleman.

262

Yeah, I did a musical revue
in Wichita.

263
00:16:01,013 --> 00:16:04,809
Maybe you heard of it. It was called
Leave A Specimen. I had two songs.

264

- [ Phone Ringing ]
- Two numbers. Two thrilling,
show-stopping numbers.

I'm actually feeling
a little sick, really.

I'm actually feeling a little faint.
Can we sit down?

So, one thing I was wonderin'
is who's gonna be playing
the part of Sylvia Poston?

268
00:16:19,414 --> 00:16:21,709
[ Chuckles ]
Only Helen Sinclair.

Helen Sinclair? [ Laughs ]
I never heard of her.

- Uh, you follow the theater?
- What are you trying to insinuate?

Hey, don't
gimme that shit!

ball, I'll come down there,
I'll chop his fuckin' legs off!

Don't you pay any attention to Nick.
He's in one of his depressed moods.

274
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:45,474
I'll cut his throat. I'll come
down there, I'll pull his guts
out through his windpipe!

00:16:47,746 --> 00:16:49,678
- No!
- You're sweating like a pig.

277
00:16:49,746 --> 00:16:53,803
- I have a bit of a blood sugar
situation now and again.
- Blood sugar?

278
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:57,573
- What is that?
- Olive, you-- you like the play?

279
00:16:57,646 --> 00:17:01,340
- Mmm. It's sad.
- Well, it's a tragedy.

280
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:05,403
I'll say, but I got some ideas
how we can goose it up.

281
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,071
- Ideas?
- Mm-hmm. I go to
the movies all the time.

282
00:17:08,314 --> 00:17:13,303
- I got a million clever ideas.
- You burn it down, Cheech!
Burn it down, I said.

283
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:16,777
- I want it to look like arson!
- I got a crick.

284
00:17:16,846 --> 00:17:18,709
- When?
- A crick?

285
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:23,304
Everything's tight.
I think maybe we should go.

286
00:17:23,347 --> 00:17:25,972
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't go.

287
00:17:26,047 --> 00:17:28,774
Hey, Venus, let's go
with that hooch!

288
00:17:28,846 --> 00:17:32,301
Uh, uh, Olive, when did you
get interested in acting?

289
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:36,903
Hey, listen, you think
I came to this town to swing
it around in a chorus line?

290
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:41,003
Tits and ass. Tits and ass.
That's all they care about. Thank you.

291
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,069
Hey, didn't I tell you
to make "horse durves"?

292
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:47,711
I don't make nothin' out of horses,
especially "horse durves..."

293
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,406
'cause I don't know what
they are, and neither do you!

294
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,536
Oh, ain't you the big mouth
since you hit your number.

295
00:17:54,613 --> 00:17:59,841
- And I said the imported stuff.
- The imported stuff ate through
the bottle. It's gone !

296
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:02,970
A likely story. It's very hard
to get good help these days.

297
00:18:03,047 --> 00:18:05,911
- Sorry you guys had to hear that.
- I'm feeling fairly dizzy.

298
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:10,776
- Some problems with the firm.
- Really? What type of firm is it, Nick?

299
00:18:10,846 --> 00:18:14,642
- [ Chuckles ]
- It's a "don't stick your nose in
other people's business...

300
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,476
- and it won't get broken type of firm.
- Yeah.

301
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:20,775
- [ Panting ] I see, I see. Thank you.
- That's what kind of firm.

302
00:18:20,846 --> 00:18:24,006
I'm feeling a bit unstable.
I think maybe I'll go...

303
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,568
and check into a sanitarium
and get the help that I need.

304
00:18:27,646 --> 00:18:31,443
- And we'll talk later because
it's been good. Hasn't it, Julian?
- Yeah.

305
00:18:31,513 --> 00:18:33,446
- Oh, yeah.
- It's been good.

306
00:18:33,513 --> 00:18:36,775
- This is gonna be
a big event on Broadway.
- Thank you.

307
00:18:36,846 --> 00:18:39,744
Absolutely not!
No!

308
00:18:39,813 --> 00:18:42,836
- You'll work with her, mold her.
It'll be a challenge.
- Out of the question!

309
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:45,970
She'll win an award. It'll be a great
show business anecdote.

310
00:18:46,047 --> 00:18:50,343
- It will not happen!
- A tribute to you as a director.
You use your actors like clay.

311
00:18:50,414 --> 00:18:53,073
Julian, have you lost
all reason?

312
00:18:53,314 --> 00:18:57,507
Do you believe that that woman
could play a psychiatrist?
That woman? That thing?

313
00:18:57,579 --> 00:18:59,511
- Her voice, her grasp.
- All right.

314
00:18:59,579 --> 00:19:04,478
- She's the woman who picks
quarters off tabletops with--
- Let me level with you.

315
00:19:04,513 --> 00:19:07,446
This is a dog-eat-dog world,
not an ideal world.

316
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:10,480
If you wanna get your play on, you're
gonna have to make a few concessions.

317
00:19:10,546 --> 00:19:13,603
Life is not perfect.
Plus, it is short.

318
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:18,045
If you can't figure that out,
you might as well pack up right
now and go back to Pittsburgh.

319
00:19:23,047 --> 00:19:27,412
- [ David Screaming ]
I sold out! I sold out.
- [ Ellen Gasping ]

320
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,672
- I sold out.
- David.

321
00:19:29,746 --> 00:19:33,008
[ Panting ]

322
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,671
- [ Gasps ]
- What's wrong?

323
00:19:35,746 --> 00:19:37,803
- [ Screaming ] I'm a whore!
- Oh, my God!

324
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,971
- I'm a prostitute! I'm a whore!
- David, pull yourself together.

325
00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:42,706
- They'll call the police.
- [ Panting ]

326
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,338
David. Oh, my God!
You look horrible.

327
00:19:45,414 --> 00:19:47,073
Oh, I feel sick.

328
00:19:47,314 --> 00:19:51,678
Please, you'll wake the Finkelsteins.
You want an aspirin?

329
00:19:51,746 --> 00:19:55,872
- David. David.
- Oh, my God! My art! My work!

330
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:58,844
- What's wrong with you?
- Do I want success that badly?

331
00:19:58,913 --> 00:20:02,936
- David. Come back to bed.
- The answer's yes. The answer's yes.

332
00:20:03,013 --> 00:20:07,070
- Please come back to bed.
- When offered to have my play
backed by a hoodlum, I said yes.

333
00:20:07,314 --> 00:20:10,973
- Please come back to bed.
- It's a deal with the devil,
and the penalty is...

334
00:20:11,047 --> 00:20:14,945
- his girlfriend plays a part.
- Who are you calling at 3:00 a.m.?

335
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:18,843
[ David ] Hello, Julian? It's David.
Who do you see in the male lead?

336
00:20:18,913 --> 00:20:21,572
Oh, kid.

337
00:20:21,646 --> 00:20:23,805
[ Groans ]
It's 3:00 a.m.

338
00:20:23,846 --> 00:20:27,040
- I see Warner Purcell.
- Nah, too fat.

339
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,644
You seen him lately?
Nah, the man's a compulsive eater.

340
00:20:31,713 --> 00:20:33,645
Doesn't matter.
I talked to his agent...

341
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,646
and he's been on a new diet
for four months. He looks fine.

342
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,408
I want him for Lieutenant Masters.
Then maybe I can live with all this.

343
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,536
I can live with
these compromises.

344
00:20:40,613 --> 00:20:44,739
I'll have Warner Purcell
and Helen Sinclair, and then
I can live with that gun moll!

345
00:20:44,813 --> 00:20:47,677
No, not Warner, kid. No.

346
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:50,043
I had him in Nuns Aplenty.

347
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:54,507
He'll turn over a new leaf. Then he'll
get insecure; he'll start eating.

348
00:20:54,579 --> 00:20:58,773
By the time we get to Boston, he'll be
as big as my sister-in-law's ass.

349
00:20:58,846 --> 00:21:02,972
No! No more compromises!
It is my play, and I want him!

350
00:21:03,047 --> 00:21:06,672
I want him, and I want him,
and that's it. I'm not a whore!

351
00:21:06,746 --> 00:21:09,906
- David, David, David!
- [ Sighs ] I'm all right.

352
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:13,605
[ Nick ] Olive starts rehearsal
for a show next week.

353
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,805
- I want you to stay with her.
- [ Cheech ] Yeah.

354
00:21:15,846 --> 00:21:18,835
I want you to make sure
they treat her right up there.

355
00:21:18,913 --> 00:21:21,777
Those theater characters
I don't trust 'em.

356
00:21:21,846 --> 00:21:25,835
The show's costing me a bundle,
and I'm gonna get my money's worth.

357
00:21:25,913 --> 00:21:28,879
- She wants to be a star.
- Yeah. Yeah.

358
00:21:28,946 --> 00:21:31,935
- And I promised her.
- Mr. V., look, it's not
that I don't wanna do it--

359
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:36,379
Cheech, I'm giving you
an order. What do you do?

360
00:21:36,447 --> 00:21:38,470
I know.

361
00:21:38,546 --> 00:21:40,671
[ David ]
Monday, September 10.

362
00:21:40,746 --> 00:21:44,270
Today rehearsals began,
and I've decided to keep a journal.

363
00:21:44,347 --> 00:21:46,972
Perhaps my experience
will be of value to others...

364
00:21:47,013 --> 00:21:51,343
just as I pore over with relish
the notes of my idols:
Chekov and Strindberg.

365
00:21:51,414 --> 00:21:54,675
Rehearsals began promptly
at 10:00 a.m.

366
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:58,610
Warner Purcell was first to arrive
full of bonhomie and good humor.

367
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:02,477
- Good morning!
- Warner Purcell.
Hello, I'm David Shayne.

368
00:22:02,546 --> 00:22:05,411
- Oh, David, how marvelous
to meet you. Well done.
- Thank you.

369
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,536
- It's a wonderful play.
Some lovely speeches.
- I'm honored you're doing it.

370
00:22:08,613 --> 00:22:10,636
- It's my pleasure.
- Our stage manager, Mitch.

371
00:22:10,713 --> 00:22:13,441
- Mitchell Sabine.
I'm here if you need anything.
- Mitchell, nice to meet you.

372
00:22:13,513 --> 00:22:15,706
- That's fine.
- And you're gonna be
in dressing room two.

373
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,939
- Lovely.
- And this is my assistant, Lorna.

374
00:22:18,013 --> 00:22:20,638
- Pleased to meet you.
- Lorna, nice to meet you.

375
00:22:20,713 --> 00:22:23,804
We have coffee and Danish,
some smoked salmon.

376
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:28,074
Um, Mitchell, would it be
frightfully tiresome if I just
had hot water and lemon?

377
00:22:28,314 --> 00:22:30,303
- Not at all.
- Thank you.

378
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,868
- And of course you know Julian Marx.
- Oh, Julian, yes.

379
00:22:32,946 --> 00:22:35,469
- Our swords have crossed.
- Warner, you look wonderful.

380
00:22:35,513 --> 00:22:37,638
- And yourself.
- [ Woman Giggling ]

381
00:22:37,713 --> 00:22:40,679
[ David ] Eden Brent, who plays
the other woman, arrived second.

382
00:22:40,713 --> 00:22:42,770
She has
a wonderful vivacity.

383
00:22:42,846 --> 00:22:46,642
[ Giggles ] Good morning! Good morning!
Don't get up. Don't get up.

384
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:49,840
- I have first-day-rehearsal
presents for everybody.
- How thoughtful.

385
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:54,710
It's nothing. Just some soap and some
potpourri and incense for you, I think.

386
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:57,940
- Now, have you met Mr. Woofles?
- No. No.

387
00:22:58,013 --> 00:23:01,377
- Oh, don't pull such a sour face.
- Hello, Mr. Woofles.

388
00:23:01,447 --> 00:23:03,379
Oh, be careful.
She's a Chihuahua...

389
00:23:03,447 --> 00:23:07,503
but there's a pinch of Doberman in her
so sometimes she goes for your throat.

390
00:23:07,579 --> 00:23:09,704
- Just kidding.
- [ Laughs ]

391
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:13,372
- I think you've met
everyone here. Lorna.
- We talked on the telephone.

392
00:23:13,447 --> 00:23:16,277
I don't know if you've met
our Lieutenant Masters, Warner Purcell.

393
00:23:16,347 --> 00:23:18,744
- Oh, pleased to meet you.
- How was your crossing?

394
00:23:18,813 --> 00:23:22,506
- Well, I came over
five years ago, but it was lovely.
- [ Giggles ]

395
00:23:22,579 --> 00:23:25,636
Now, my darling, do you want
some milk or something to eat?

396
00:23:25,713 --> 00:23:29,839
- I'll get her a saucer.
- You don't have to bother with
that because I breast-feed her.

397
00:23:29,913 --> 00:23:33,606
- Just kidding, everybody.
- [ Laughing ]

398
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,873
- Please.
- Julian, nice to see you.

399
00:23:35,946 --> 00:23:38,378
- How are you?
- Mr. Marx.
- Yes, of course.

400
00:23:38,447 --> 00:23:41,072
I'm in the middle, yes?

401
00:23:41,314 --> 00:23:43,973
- [ David ] Should we take the dog--
- No, no, no, no, no.

402
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:46,842
It's my baby.
[ Giggles ]

403
00:23:46,913 --> 00:23:50,845
[ David ] Olive Neal entered, naturally,
with the force of a hurricane.

404
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,279
- Hey, you gonna hover
over me like dead meat?
- Mr. V. says I stay close.

405
00:23:55,347 --> 00:23:57,279
We've been drivin'
around for 15 minutes.

406
00:23:57,347 --> 00:24:01,074
I told ya he said the Belasco,
not the Morosco, you cementhead!

407
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:02,677
- Hello, Olive.
- Hello.

408
00:24:02,746 --> 00:24:05,940
- Everyone, this is Dr. Philips.
Olive Neal.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

409
00:24:06,013 --> 00:24:07,501
- You know Julian.
- Yes.

410
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:09,568
- My assistant, Lorna.
- Hi.

411
00:24:09,646 --> 00:24:11,771
- Eden Brent, Kristen.
- Ah, cute dog.

412
00:24:11,846 --> 00:24:14,438
- Warner Purcell. Lieutenant Masters.
- Charmed, charmed, charmed.

413
00:24:14,513 --> 00:24:16,945
- Stage manager Mitch.
- Mitch, hi, hi, hi, hi.

414
00:24:17,013 --> 00:24:19,774
- And you are?
- I'm with her.

415
00:24:19,846 --> 00:24:22,835
- He's with me. Yeah.
- Okay. Okay.

416
00:24:22,913 --> 00:24:26,311
Well, um, we're just gonna
rehearse for a while, so--

417
00:24:26,347 --> 00:24:28,313
Yeah.
Where she goes, I go.

418
00:24:28,347 --> 00:24:31,336
All right, buster,
why don't you park yourself in
the back row of the theater...

419
00:24:31,414 --> 00:24:33,346
and try not to snore.

420
00:24:33,414 --> 00:24:35,879
Um, I--

421
00:24:35,946 --> 00:24:38,935
- What?
- I don't like other people
watching rehearsals...

422
00:24:39,013 --> 00:24:42,809
- generally as a rule because
the actors are very sensitive.
- What'd you say?

423
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,313
- I-I don't like--
- Hey, hey, who are you? Who are you?

424
00:24:46,347 --> 00:24:48,336
- Whoa, whoa. Easy.
- I'm the director.

425
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:49,811
- Who is this?
- Wait a minute.

426
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,778
- I'm the director of the play.
- Wait a minute, Mr., uh--

427
00:24:52,813 --> 00:24:55,711
- Cheech. The name's Cheech.
- Mr. Cheech, first of all--

428
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:58,474
- No, not Mr. Cheech. Ya hear me?
- Yeah.

429
00:24:58,546 --> 00:25:01,479
- Cheech. Simple. Cheech.
- Cheech.

430
00:25:01,546 --> 00:25:05,842
Now, why don't you just take a seat
in the back and we'll-- Yeah, go ahead.

431
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,472
- That's it.
- I find this very problematic.

432
00:25:08,546 --> 00:25:10,705
- I'll be over there.
- He'll be unobtrusive, believe me.

433
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:14,440
He's not gonna bother anybody.
He just wants to watch.

434
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:17,480
He's my bodyguard.
[ Giggles ]

435
00:25:17,546 --> 00:25:19,944
- Hi.
- Hello.

436
00:25:20,013 --> 00:25:24,536
- Sorry I'm late.
I'm usually highly professional.
- Oh, I'm sure.

437
00:25:24,613 --> 00:25:28,807
- This is for you.
- Oh, talcum powder. My favorite.

438
00:25:28,846 --> 00:25:32,608
- Thank you. You're a doll.
- Oh, no, you're a doll.

439
00:25:32,646 --> 00:25:36,409
[ David ] Helen Sinclair came a half
hour late, but she had a good excuse.

440
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,037
Please forgive me.
My pedicurist had a stroke.

441
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:43,734
She fell forward onto the orange stick
and plunged it into my toe.

442
00:25:43,813 --> 00:25:46,677
- It required bandaging.
- Oh, my poor darling.

443
00:25:46,746 --> 00:25:49,304
Oh, it's so good
to see you.

444
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:52,006
- We all know and admire Helen Sinclair.
- [ Warner ] We're old friends.

445
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,841
- Thank you so much.
- Miss Sinclair, this is Mitch.

446
00:25:54,913 --> 00:25:59,971
Oh, yes, yes. Oh, my goodness' sake.
I can't believe I'm here.

447
00:26:00,047 --> 00:26:03,979
Oh-ho, look at this.
Look at this. Would you look?

448
00:26:04,013 --> 00:26:06,706
Oh, this old theater.

449
00:26:08,447 --> 00:26:10,470
This church.

450
00:26:11,579 --> 00:26:13,977
So replete
with memories.

451
00:26:14,047 --> 00:26:17,411
So full of ghosts.

452
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,809
Mrs. Alving.

453
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,846
Uncle Vanya.

454
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,312
There's Cordelia.

455
00:26:26,013 --> 00:26:28,501
Here's Ophelia.

456
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:32,377
Clytemenstra!

457
00:26:33,946 --> 00:26:36,412
Each performance
a birth.

458
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:39,809
Each curtain...

459
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,937
a death.

460
00:26:42,013 --> 00:26:44,706
[ Mr. Woofles Barking ]

461
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:46,973
Was that a mutt?

462
00:26:47,047 --> 00:26:49,672
[ Mitch ]
Yes, Miss Sinclair.

463
00:26:49,746 --> 00:26:53,872
- I hate mutts!
- [ Barking Continues ]

464
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:56,935
[ David ] I didn't want to overwhelm
any of the actors on the first day...

465
00:26:57,013 --> 00:26:59,638
so all we did
was read through the play.

466
00:26:59,713 --> 00:27:01,906
I can't live
like this.

467
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:05,435
The same routine
over and over and over.

468
00:27:05,513 --> 00:27:07,877
The days blend together
like melted celluloid.

469
00:27:07,946 --> 00:27:11,503
Like a film whose images
become distorted and meaningless.

470
00:27:11,579 --> 00:27:14,807
I want a divorce, Sylvia. I've said it
in a thousand subtle ways...

471
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,937
hoping you would realize,
but you refuse to see it.

472
00:27:18,013 --> 00:27:20,979
As a little girl,
I swore one day...

473
00:27:21,047 --> 00:27:24,377
I would have a necklace
made from the Milky Way.

474
00:27:24,447 --> 00:27:29,777
Oh, Kristen, Kristen, if only humans
weren't cursed with the power of memory.

475
00:27:29,846 --> 00:27:33,505
[ Olive Reading Flatly ]
Dreams are only disguised feelings.

476
00:27:33,579 --> 00:27:37,875
The more we bring these
painful experiences to the fore...

477
00:27:37,946 --> 00:27:40,810
the easier they become
to deal with.

478
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,438
- What's the "fore"?
- The fore. The foreground.

479
00:27:43,513 --> 00:27:45,604
- [ Warner ] Is it-- Could I?
- [ David ] Please.

480
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:49,612
It's a golf term, when you yell, "fore"
when you're coming forward.

481
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:53,443
- [ Helen ] I didn't realize that.
- So you're telling me
she's talking about golf?

482
00:27:53,513 --> 00:27:54,774
- Continue!
- What?

483
00:27:54,846 --> 00:27:57,472
[ Helen ]
Oh, yes, okay. Doctor...

484
00:27:57,513 --> 00:28:00,741
am I unattractive,
worn out?

485
00:28:00,813 --> 00:28:04,939
Spent? Broken?
Desiccated? Old?

486
00:28:05,013 --> 00:28:09,275
[ Olive ] Come, come, Mrs. Poston.
You're being mas--

487
00:28:10,579 --> 00:28:12,478
- Mas--
- [ David ] Masochistic.

488
00:28:12,546 --> 00:28:17,445
- Masochistic?
- Yes, masochism is someone
who enjoys pain.

489
00:28:17,513 --> 00:28:20,412
- [ Warner ] As opposed to sadism.
- Enjoys pain?

490
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,604
What is she,
retarded?

491
00:28:22,646 --> 00:28:25,737
- I don't fuckin' believe this!
- Continue.

492
00:28:25,813 --> 00:28:29,041
[ David ] After the rehearsal,
I felt exhilarated.

493
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,768
Helen Sinclair suggested
we go for a drink to unwind.

494
00:28:31,813 --> 00:28:36,075
She said she knew
of a little out-of-the-way
speakeasy where we could talk.

495
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:38,779
- It was wonderful to see old, uh--
- Wasn't it?

496
00:28:38,846 --> 00:28:42,301
- Warner. Yes.
- Warner, yeah. He looks so slim.

497
00:28:42,347 --> 00:28:45,472
- He's on a new diet.
- Who is she? Oh, I need a drink.

498
00:28:45,546 --> 00:28:47,671
Olive. [ Chuckles ]
Yes. I'm sorry about Olive.

499
00:28:47,746 --> 00:28:50,474
I do apologize.
We needed her to raise the money.

500
00:28:50,546 --> 00:28:52,876
It must be difficult
getting a work like this on.

501
00:28:52,946 --> 00:28:55,412
It's a sad reality
of the marketplace, I'll tell ya.

502
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,911
- We've never really
had a chance to talk.
- No.

503
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:01,571
- Hi, folks. What can I get you?
- Two martinis, please, very dry.

504
00:29:01,646 --> 00:29:04,976
- How'd you know what I drank?
- Oh, you want one too?

505
00:29:05,013 --> 00:29:07,002
- Three.
- Three martinis.

506
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:10,568
Uh, I can't judge my own writing,
but I must say...

507
00:29:10,646 --> 00:29:14,806
that just from today's reading,
I can tell how brilliant
you're going to be in this role.

508
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,743
- It's a wonderful play.
- Thank you.

509
00:29:16,813 --> 00:29:20,870
No, no, I mean it. It's so rare
that anything is really about something.

510
00:29:20,946 --> 00:29:23,878
You know-- Well, there's Max Anderson
and Gene O'Neill.

511
00:29:23,946 --> 00:29:26,469
- That's about it.
- You just named my two living gods.

512
00:29:26,513 --> 00:29:29,480
I was a little reluctant at first
to play the part.

513
00:29:29,513 --> 00:29:33,809
The character is so--
She's so, um... uh, colorless.

514
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,539
Colorless, yes.
Well, that's the idea--

515
00:29:35,613 --> 00:29:37,602
- Then I realized what
you were going for.
- You did?

516
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,839
How profound, how complex,
her inner life really is.

517
00:29:39,913 --> 00:29:42,379
I tried to give her
some contradictions.

518
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:44,413
I was worried.

519
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,469
I'm used to playing
more overtly heroic women.

520
00:29:48,513 --> 00:29:51,309
Less tentative.
More alluring.

521
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:53,777
Certainly not
frigid.

522
00:29:53,846 --> 00:29:59,074
No, yes, yes. Well, Sylvia Poston
is a mass of neuroses.

523
00:29:59,314 --> 00:30:03,371
In spite of the fact that I
could really find nothing at all
in the play to brighten her up...

524
00:30:03,447 --> 00:30:06,571
- no real passion, no seductiveness...
- Nothing?

525
00:30:06,646 --> 00:30:08,942
I still think that
she's worth playing.

526
00:30:09,013 --> 00:30:13,070
We could work it over, and
a touch here or there could be
changed to make sure you're...

527
00:30:13,314 --> 00:30:16,405
- No, no, no, no.
I wouldn't dream of you...
- comfortable.

528
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,002
changing a word
of your work for me.

529
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:24,274
God, who am l, some
vain Broadway legend?

530
00:30:24,347 --> 00:30:28,074
You... you're
a budding Chekhov.

531
00:30:31,347 --> 00:30:36,370
I'm not saying I'll distort the play.
I'm just saying I'll reread it
with that in mind.

532
00:30:36,447 --> 00:30:39,503
I mean, after all, Miss Sinclair--
Helen. May I call you Helen?

533
00:30:39,579 --> 00:30:41,704
- Yes.
- Helen...

534
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:44,905
your instincts as an actress
are impeccable.

535
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:49,708
And I want the character
to have dimension. I don't mean
for her to be a drone.

536
00:30:50,813 --> 00:30:53,973
- You see through me, don't you?
- Me?

537
00:30:54,013 --> 00:30:56,343
You're clever.

538
00:30:56,414 --> 00:30:58,641
You're brilliant.

539
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,306
What insight
into women.

540
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,437
Don't deny it.

541
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,536
I don't see why
she has to be frigid.

542
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:19,310
[ Nick ] Hey, how ya doin', doll?
How'd it go?

543
00:31:19,347 --> 00:31:21,642
[ Olive ] Ah, they're all
so stuck up.

544
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:24,577
- Yeah? Anybody botherin' her?
- No.

545
00:31:24,646 --> 00:31:27,477
They expect me to memorize
all these lines.

546
00:31:27,513 --> 00:31:31,310
- Well, that's what you wanted,
isn't it? To be an actress?
- I know, I know, I know.

547
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:34,904
- I got a headache.
- Cheech'll help you
practice after we eat.

548
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:38,571
- Me?
- The girl's got stuff
to memorize, all right?

549
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:41,908
- Yeah, but, Nick--
- Go sit in the tub, honey. Go ahead.

550
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:45,707
I'm takin' you out to Delmonico's.
You want sirloin or a lobster?

551
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:49,440
- One of each.
- Listen, Nick, I'm not too good
at this memorizing, and I got a date--

552
00:31:49,513 --> 00:31:53,378
All right, all right, knock it off.
I got a little errand for you to run.

553
00:31:53,447 --> 00:31:58,277
- What kind of errand?
- A message for Charlie Masucci,
and we ain't got a lot of time.

554
00:31:59,414 --> 00:32:14,269
##

555
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:21,937
Up a lazy river
where the old mill run

556
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:26,810
Meets lazy, lazy river
in the noonday sun

557
00:32:26,846 --> 00:32:31,574
Linger in the shade
of a kind old tree

558
00:32:31,646 --> 00:32:34,442
Throw away your troubles
Dream a dream--

559
00:32:37,347 --> 00:32:40,904
- Up a lazy river
where the robin's song
- [ Water Splashing ]

560
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:43,071
Awakes a bright
new morning--

561
00:32:43,314 --> 00:32:45,677
Can't you see...

562
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:48,907
you're living out
the exact same pattern...

563
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:51,673
your mother lived out
with your father?

564
00:32:51,746 --> 00:32:54,837
I am?
Pray tell.

565
00:32:54,913 --> 00:32:58,277
In some way,
you're trying to relive it,

566
00:32:58,347 --> 00:33:02,404
and in the process
of reliving it, correct it.

567
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,968
As if that were possible.
Ha!

568
00:33:06,047 --> 00:33:09,275
-It don't say "Ha."
-I know it don't say "Ha." I added that.

569
00:33:09,347 --> 00:33:12,540
- What do ya mean you added that?
Are you allowed to do that?
- We're allowed to add things.

570
00:33:12,613 --> 00:33:15,011
- How could you add something?
You can't do that.
- You're allowed!

571
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,511
- It's called ad-libbing.
- You can't do that!

572
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:20,943
I can do that. What do you know? You
don't know nothin'. Shut up and read.

573
00:33:21,013 --> 00:33:24,604
- I think the whole thing stinks.
- I think you're a degenerate
zombie. Shut up and read!

574
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:27,374
- You better shut up! Just shut up!
- You shut up and read.

575
00:33:27,447 --> 00:33:30,379
- You shut up!
- You're lucky you're Nick's girl.

576
00:33:30,447 --> 00:33:32,379
You're lucky
you're an idiot.

577
00:33:32,447 --> 00:33:37,311
What endeavors you...
to concoct a theory so tenuous?

578
00:33:37,347 --> 00:33:39,074
Mmm-mmm-mm.

579
00:33:39,314 --> 00:33:43,303
I sure pities the poor folks who gonna
have to pay to see this play.

580
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:49,412
- What ya thinking?
- Oh, just about Eugene O'Neill
and Max Anderson, you know.

581
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:52,877
Yeah. You've been rewriting all night
and it's only just the first day.

582
00:33:52,946 --> 00:33:55,310
- Is that a bad sign?
- No. I just think that
I might have made...

583
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,743
the character of Sylvia Poston
a bit too antiseptic.

584
00:33:57,813 --> 00:33:59,870
- She's gotta have a sexual side to her.
- No.

585
00:33:59,946 --> 00:34:04,345
- I think she's the best female
character you've written in a long time.
- Says who?

586
00:34:04,414 --> 00:34:07,777
David, you know you always have
problems getting into the female mind.

587
00:34:07,846 --> 00:34:11,801
- I know that you think that.
- You've said so yourself before.
We've had this discussion.

588
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:16,472
All your friends are men. You-- You've
always had problems writing for women.

589
00:34:16,546 --> 00:34:19,342
Witness your relationship
with your mother, your grandmother...

590
00:34:19,414 --> 00:34:22,504
- your two aunts, your sister--
- I think I try to factor that
into my work.

591
00:34:22,579 --> 00:34:24,511
But to be honest with you...

592
00:34:24,579 --> 00:34:26,511
at this moment, I don't think
you really understand my work at all.

593
00:34:26,579 --> 00:34:28,636
- Oh! Don't be so defensive.
- I'm not being defensive.

594
00:34:28,713 --> 00:34:32,645
Perhaps my opinions just aren't
intellectual enough for you.
Maybe they're just not--

595
00:34:32,713 --> 00:34:36,873
That's a horrible thing to say.
When you have a good idea,
I listen to it. I'm responsive.

596
00:34:36,946 --> 00:34:40,401
- In this case, I think you're
wrong. That's about it.
- When am I right?

597
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,912
You're right about other things, but not
about Sylvia Poston and her sexuality.

598
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:47,537
[ David ] September 17.
The first week is behind me now...

599
00:34:47,613 --> 00:34:51,444
and apart from a few minor incidents,
things seemed to go okay.

600
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,945
There was that moment
between Helen and Eden.

601
00:34:54,013 --> 00:34:57,911
I can't do that speech if she's
going to be fidgeting around upstage!

602
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:00,571
- Well, that's why I think
I should sit. I'll sit.
- Oh, God!

603
00:35:00,646 --> 00:35:04,272
Sylvia would never ask her to sit
in her own house. She despises her!

604
00:35:04,347 --> 00:35:08,006
She doesn't want me to sit. She doesn't
want me to stand. I guess I could squat.

605
00:35:08,047 --> 00:35:11,275
David, do you realize you're asking an
audience to believe that my husband...

606
00:35:11,314 --> 00:35:13,303
would leave me
for this woman?

607
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:17,278
- Come along.
- Excuse me. Excuse me, but
I think it's made very clear...

608
00:35:17,347 --> 00:35:20,074
in the speech about erotic attraction,
why he does that.

609
00:35:20,314 --> 00:35:22,779
You fool! He's thinking of me
when he does that speech.
Don't you know anything?

610
00:35:22,813 --> 00:35:25,279
- Only the part about the liver spots.
- Listen.

611
00:35:25,347 --> 00:35:29,302
How long has it been since
you've had a real hemorrhage?

612
00:35:29,347 --> 00:35:33,370
David, I wonder if now would be a moment
to do my soliloquy from Act II?

613
00:35:33,447 --> 00:35:38,470
- [ Crying ] Did you hear what she--
- Please. Aspirin!

614
00:35:38,513 --> 00:35:42,276
[ David ] All right, yes, why don't we?
And, Eden, just take five.

615
00:35:42,314 --> 00:35:45,007
- I need an aspirin!
- [ Crying Continues ]

616
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:48,012
[ David ]
Mitch.

617
00:35:48,047 --> 00:35:51,638
[ David ] Then there was the time when
I tried to cut one of Olive's speeches.

618
00:35:51,713 --> 00:35:55,770
- I like that speech,
and I already got it memorized.
- But it's superfluous.

619
00:35:55,846 --> 00:35:58,573
- It's-- What is it?
- Well, I've overwritten it.

620
00:35:58,646 --> 00:36:02,976
We know how you feel
about Sylvia's breakdown when
you talk with the good doctor.

621
00:36:03,047 --> 00:36:05,842
So it's my fault.
Um, the performance is fine.

622
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:09,004
But, um...
I like to say it.

623
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,568
- We-- We don't need it.
- Hey!

624
00:36:11,646 --> 00:36:14,669
Are you tryin' to make
my part smaller?

625
00:36:14,746 --> 00:36:17,304
- No, no, every--
- My part's small enough as it is!

626
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:20,971
Every play needs some cuts, and the size
of the role is not the important thing.

627
00:36:21,047 --> 00:36:24,638
Did you hear what she said? She doesn't
want her speech taken away from her!

628
00:36:24,713 --> 00:36:29,271
- Look, look, Mr. Cheech, I've about--
- I'd rather be shootin' crap myself...

629
00:36:29,347 --> 00:36:33,938
but Mr. V. told me that she's gotta
be up there a lot!

630
00:36:34,013 --> 00:36:36,638
- I wrote this play,
and I'm directing this play!
- I don't care.

631
00:36:36,713 --> 00:36:40,668
You wanna get slapped here or do
you want me to take you outside
and we'll straighten this out?

632
00:36:40,746 --> 00:36:43,440
It's up to you.

633
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:50,443
[ David ] Warner Purcell remains
good-spirited and a joy to work with.

634
00:36:50,513 --> 00:36:55,844
And what discipline. Although,
I notice he no longer has just
a cup of hot water and lemon.

635
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:02,012
[ Eden ] lf you start it off
at that level--

636
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:06,808
Well, what are we going to do
about that canine-loving ingenue?

637
00:37:06,846 --> 00:37:09,778
- Did you cast her because
you thought she was attractive?
- She's pretty...

638
00:37:09,846 --> 00:37:13,472
but more importantly, she has a certain
perkiness that the character requires.

639
00:37:13,546 --> 00:37:17,445
She's perky. She makes you
wanna sneak up behind her with
a pillow and suffocate her.

640
00:37:17,513 --> 00:37:19,877
- It's a beautiful apartment.
- Josette.

641
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:22,776
- My beaker of martinis.
- Your taste is exquisite.

642
00:37:22,813 --> 00:37:27,269
My taste is superb.
My eyes are exquisite.

643
00:37:27,347 --> 00:37:29,472
What justifiable confidence.

644
00:37:29,513 --> 00:37:33,071
- I think at some point you're
going to have to fire Olive.
- I'm afraid that's not possible.

645
00:37:33,314 --> 00:37:37,871
Oh, how can you take her butchering
your poetry? I know I couldn't stand it.

646
00:37:37,946 --> 00:37:42,038
No one in his right mind is
going to believe she's a doctor,
not even a veterinarian.

647
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:45,337
- [ Chuckles ]
- I understand, but it's a compromise
I have to live with...

648
00:37:45,414 --> 00:37:47,811
and if I want the play to open,
I have to find a way to live with it.

649
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,403
I plan on reducing the scope of her role
if her bodyguard will let me.

650
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,412
Can you believe
that character?

651
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,570
Imagine, traveling with
your own private Neanderthal.

652
00:37:55,646 --> 00:37:58,578
- I wasn't aware that you opened
The Master Builder.
- Oh, well.

653
00:37:58,646 --> 00:38:01,874
I had forgotten that
you won that drama award.

654
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:04,810
- Here's to your play.
- Oh, thank you. Our play.

655
00:38:04,846 --> 00:38:08,676
To an ideal world
with no compromise.

656
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:15,946
Oh, my gosh,
look at this view!

657
00:38:16,013 --> 00:38:20,741
A million blinking lights.
A million broken hearts.

658
00:38:20,813 --> 00:38:23,336
- You know what's down there?
- What?

659
00:38:23,414 --> 00:38:26,471
- Broadway.
- Ah. That's your street.

660
00:38:26,546 --> 00:38:31,604
Mm-hmm. Yes, that's my street,
but I'd like to give it to you.

661
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,635
- That is, if you want it.
- Who wouldn't want it?

662
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:39,476
I want you to write a play for me.
Oh, I mean when all this is over.

663
00:38:39,513 --> 00:38:43,310
- Really?
- Your next play, I want you to create
a vehicle for Helen Sinclair.

664
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:46,573
- I'm honored.
- But it must have size...

665
00:38:46,646 --> 00:38:48,771
an important woman.

666
00:38:48,846 --> 00:38:52,505
- A Borgia. A Curie. You name it.
- Yes!

667
00:38:52,579 --> 00:38:55,511
- I'll dedicate myself to it.
- Oh, and while you're at it...

668
00:38:55,579 --> 00:38:58,841
if you could just have
a look at that scene in Act ll.

669
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:03,074
If she succeeds in seducing
the Lieutenant instead of
being rejected a second time...

670
00:39:03,314 --> 00:39:08,474
- it could add some variation
to the character.
- Yes, that's a wonderful idea.

671
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:11,002
The heart is "labyrinthinine..."

672
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:15,410
a maze beset with brutal pitfalls
and mean obstacles.

673
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:19,878
David, I can't say that line. It doesn't
make sense. It's stupid. I don't get it.

674
00:39:19,946 --> 00:39:23,605
- It's just a stylish way
of expressing a particular idea.
- Idea? What idea?

675
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,805
The agony of love.
The difficulty of relating.

676
00:39:25,846 --> 00:39:28,539
- Why do you have to make it
so hard to say?
- Just say the line.

677
00:39:28,613 --> 00:39:31,602
- No, I can't say it.
It's a mouthful of "ghibberish."
- Gibberish!

678
00:39:31,646 --> 00:39:34,442
- I can't say it, and I will not say it.
- Just do the line.

679
00:39:34,513 --> 00:39:36,446
No! I'm not making
a fool of myself.

680
00:39:36,513 --> 00:39:38,446
[ Cheech ]
She's right, it stinks.

681
00:39:38,513 --> 00:39:40,945
Oh-ho, Jesus,
another party heard from.

682
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:43,639
It's a stupid way of talkin',
and nobody talks like that.

683
00:39:43,713 --> 00:39:46,077
- I don't believe this is happening.
- Frankenstein is right.

684
00:39:46,314 --> 00:39:48,303
When I want your opinion,
I will ask for it.

685
00:39:48,347 --> 00:39:51,074
I can't stand to listen to this
garbage. Every day I sit back there...

686
00:39:51,314 --> 00:39:53,075
and I hear the same bullshit
over and over again.

687
00:39:53,314 --> 00:39:55,075
Then leave.
No one asked you here.

688
00:39:55,314 --> 00:39:56,973
[ Helen ]
Oh, David, take it easy.

689
00:39:57,013 --> 00:39:59,411
Where did you study play writing?
Was it Sing Sing?

690
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,809
"A maze beset
by brutal pitfalls--"

691
00:40:01,846 --> 00:40:04,438
Hey, Olive, I memorized it,
and I'm tellin' ya...

692
00:40:04,513 --> 00:40:07,946
it comes to me all the time,
and it stinks on fuckin' hot ice!

693
00:40:08,013 --> 00:40:10,979
- That's it. I quit. This is crazy.
- [ Warner ] David.

694
00:40:11,047 --> 00:40:14,740
- Oh, please, I have a little hangover!
- I am famished.

695
00:40:14,813 --> 00:40:17,870
Everyone, everyone,
why don't we take lunch? An hour?

696
00:40:17,946 --> 00:40:20,810
- [ Mr. Woofles Barking ]
- You don't wanna
say the goddamned line...

697
00:40:20,846 --> 00:40:24,074
- don't say the goddamned line!
- Oh, look at you, Mr. Temperamental.

698
00:40:24,314 --> 00:40:27,905
[ Helen ] lf that rat on a leash
barks one more time--

699
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:30,878
-He sounds melancholy. Is he melancholy?
-You can trim the line.

700
00:40:30,946 --> 00:40:34,401
- Because she can't handle it?
- Because you said yourself
you were having trouble with it.

701
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,707
- So you agree with the gorilla?
- David, for Christ sake! It's one line!

702
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:38,973
- It's not going to wreck the scene.
- That's not the point!

703
00:40:39,013 --> 00:40:42,468
Suddenly I'm taking suggestions from a
strong-arm man with an I.Q. of minus 50.

704
00:40:42,546 --> 00:40:44,512
I've had it!

705
00:40:44,546 --> 00:40:47,842
- David, for goodness' sake. Come on.
- Look who's here.

706
00:40:47,913 --> 00:40:50,743
Oh, God!
Get my rifle!

707
00:40:50,813 --> 00:40:54,337
I guess I'm just hypersensitive because
maybe deep down, I agree with the goon.

708
00:40:54,414 --> 00:40:58,812
- Maybe it is a turgid line.
I don't know. My nerves are shot.
- No. Just calm yourself.

709
00:40:58,846 --> 00:41:03,540
Helen, the play is not working.
It's not working, and it's in my
writing. It's not just Olive.

710
00:41:03,613 --> 00:41:07,807
That's the reason we have rehearsal.
That's the reason we go out of town.

711
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:13,269
You have such a wonderful attitude.
I'm so lucky.

712
00:41:13,347 --> 00:41:15,972
The best part of this project every day
is that I get to come to work...

713
00:41:16,047 --> 00:41:18,945
and see you and be with you
and work with you.

714
00:41:19,013 --> 00:41:23,502
- I don't mean to spoil the day.
- Then let's not.

715
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:26,875
Sit down here.
I'm going to show you something.

716
00:41:26,946 --> 00:41:28,844
Okay.

717
00:41:29,913 --> 00:41:32,777
This is my favorite spot
in the park.

718
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:38,008
And in winter,
when it's covered with snow...

719
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:42,774
at about 4:30 in the afternoon,
when it's just getting dark
and the lights come on...

720
00:41:42,813 --> 00:41:44,779
it's all misty.

721
00:41:44,846 --> 00:41:49,744
And you can just see the silhouettes of
the Manhattan skyline through the trees.

722
00:41:49,813 --> 00:41:52,302
And it's magical.

723
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,709
It's magical.

724
00:41:56,447 --> 00:41:59,038
Helen, I think I'm falling
in love with you.

725
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,075
Don't.

726
00:42:01,314 --> 00:42:05,303
- I don't know if I can help it.
- David, please, we must be strong.

727
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:08,937
I've kept a check on my feelings
for so long, but there's
so much that I want to say.

728
00:42:09,013 --> 00:42:11,604
- What are words?
- Oh, gosh.

729
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,942
David, everything meaningful
is in some unexplainable form.

730
00:42:15,013 --> 00:42:19,275
It's-- It's more primordial
than mere language.

731
00:42:19,347 --> 00:42:21,710
- I'm not sure I follow that one.
- Oh, be silent.

732
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:23,746
- Be silent.
- Helen--

733
00:42:23,813 --> 00:42:26,904
No, let's just sit here
holding our thoughts.

734
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:29,810
Not revealing them.
Be still.

735
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:34,642
Let the birds have their song.
Let ours for now remain unsung.

736
00:42:34,713 --> 00:42:36,838
You're amazing.

737
00:42:36,913 --> 00:42:40,811
[ "Ain't Misbehavin"' ]

738
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:45,673
Stop it.
Stop it.

739
00:42:45,746 --> 00:42:48,474
- I'm not in the mood!
- What do you mean
you're not in the mood?

740
00:42:48,546 --> 00:42:50,739
Honey, you better get in the mood,
'cause he's payin' the rent.

741
00:42:50,813 --> 00:42:54,643
Shut up, Venus!
Just what I said: I'm not in the mood.

742
00:42:54,713 --> 00:42:59,305
- Do I have to be in the mood
every time you are?
- Stop puttin' on the airs.

743
00:42:59,347 --> 00:43:02,642
- I'm not puttin' on airs.
- I never knew you when you wasn't
ready for a little action.

744
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:06,635
Well, today, I'm not ready for action.
I'm tired. Rehearsal is hard.

745
00:43:06,713 --> 00:43:09,770
- Get your motor goin'.
- No!

746
00:43:09,846 --> 00:43:12,971
- Hey, I brought you somethin'.
- What?

747
00:43:13,047 --> 00:43:16,275
- Huh?
- Hmm.

748
00:43:16,347 --> 00:43:18,313
What do ya say?
Come on.

749
00:43:18,347 --> 00:43:21,404
- Nickie.
- Oh, I got a great bottle
of French wine.

750
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,446
Joey Foster
made it himself.

751
00:43:23,513 --> 00:43:25,979
Pasadena. I'm pooped.

752
00:43:26,013 --> 00:43:28,377
Let's misbehave

753
00:43:28,447 --> 00:43:31,606
There's something wild
about you, child--

754
00:43:31,646 --> 00:43:34,010
[ David ] Today, Ellen came
to watch rehearsal.

755
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:37,739
She was very excited to meet the cast,
especially Warner Purcell.

756
00:43:37,813 --> 00:43:42,541
- Warner, Warner, Warner.
This is Ellen. My girlfriend.
- Oh! Pleased to meet you.

757
00:43:42,613 --> 00:43:46,410
- You should be very proud.
He has a rare talent.
- Yes, he does.

758
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,344
[ David ] The morning proceeded
very smoothly for the first half hour.

759
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:51,346
And then
another incident occurred.

760
00:43:51,414 --> 00:43:55,437
The heart obeys
its own rules. Ha!

761
00:43:55,513 --> 00:43:59,969
As a doctor, your respect for
rationalities is not very profound.

762
00:44:00,047 --> 00:44:01,979
- David, I-- David, can I--
- [ David ] Yes?

763
00:44:02,047 --> 00:44:05,809
I don't understand the character here.
Suddenly, she's too wise.

764
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:10,040
And, David, I don't know why she's
telling her to dump her fiance.

765
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,643
- She's caught up with the Lieutenant.
- The Lieutenant?

766
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:15,408
But it's as if she's just mouthing
the playwright's philosophy.

767
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:18,673
- Why would she just up and leave Tom?
- Because she's impulsive.

768
00:44:18,713 --> 00:44:22,271
- It doesn't feel right.
- Well, yeah, and I don't
understand, you know...

769
00:44:22,347 --> 00:44:25,642
if I'm a doctor, how come
I'm giving her such bad advice?

770
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,805
- It's not bad advice.
- It is bad advice.

771
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:31,835
But, David, you see, in Act I,
she says that Tom changed her life.

772
00:44:31,913 --> 00:44:35,471
- Yes, but she's recklessly
driven to the Lieutenant.
- It doesn't make sense.

773
00:44:35,546 --> 00:44:37,842
- Just give it a chance.
- There's something
contradictory about it.

774
00:44:37,913 --> 00:44:40,277
- Just give it a chance.
- It's just bad writing.

775
00:44:40,347 --> 00:44:42,972
[ Cheech ]
I'll tell ya what's wrong.

776
00:44:43,047 --> 00:44:45,706
- Oh, Christ! Julian?
- Now let's wait a minute.

777
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:49,610
- Let's not get into a situation here.
- She shouldn't leave the guy.

778
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,805
She should stick with him.

779
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:56,006
Then when the Lieutenant has
that fight with his wife and
walks out, he should notice her.

780
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:58,739
That way,
it won't be boring.

781
00:45:07,013 --> 00:45:10,446
Somebody say something!

782
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,968
- I think it's a good idea.
- [ Julian ] It's not a bad one.

783
00:45:14,047 --> 00:45:16,275
- You're kidding.
- Oh, no.

784
00:45:16,347 --> 00:45:18,505
It's, uh--
It really isn't.

785
00:45:18,579 --> 00:45:21,545
[ Warner ] Personally, I like it.
I think it's very dramatic.

786
00:45:21,613 --> 00:45:24,602
Ellen, do you see what I'm up against?
Do you see what I have to put up with?

787
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:27,578
- I think he has an interesting concept.
- What?

788
00:45:27,646 --> 00:45:29,839
Not to say that--

789
00:45:29,913 --> 00:45:32,402
- She doesn't leave the Lieutenant.
- Right.

790
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,502
- She doesn't leave her fiance.
- Right.

791
00:45:34,579 --> 00:45:37,875
We lose that scene, and suddenly
a lot of good possibilities open up.

792
00:45:37,946 --> 00:45:40,810
- [ Cheech ] It's a helluva lot
better than what you got.
- I actually like it.

793
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,369
- You're taking his side?
- It's not a question of sides.

794
00:45:43,447 --> 00:45:46,810
- David, she's right.
The play always bogged down there.
- Try it.

795
00:45:46,846 --> 00:45:50,801
- That's why the actors
always looked so uncomfortable.
- I can't make those changes.

796
00:45:50,846 --> 00:45:55,279
- Why not? H-H-How do they meet again?
- Because the--

797
00:45:55,347 --> 00:45:59,676
The Lieutenant notices her, right?
And then, he goes after her.

798
00:45:59,713 --> 00:46:03,668
I mean, that's the way
it would happen in real life.
He goes after her. Come on.

799
00:46:03,746 --> 00:46:07,940
You can't force it, kid. I mean, if it's
meant to go in a whole other direction--

800
00:46:08,013 --> 00:46:11,468
- I quit!
- Oh, don't be so egotistical.

801
00:46:11,546 --> 00:46:13,705
- I'm outta here.
- Egotistical? Why?
Because I protect my play?

802
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:17,304
- Protect it against what? A good idea?
- Oh, thank you for the support.

803
00:46:17,347 --> 00:46:20,540
- No, no, I quit! That's it. Good-bye.
- I'm gonna go shoot crap.

804
00:46:20,613 --> 00:46:22,806
- That's it. I quit.
- Wait a minute.

805
00:46:22,846 --> 00:46:25,812
[ Julian ]
David. David!

806
00:46:25,846 --> 00:46:28,039
- I'm gonna go shoot crap.
- David.

807
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:31,474
- [ Mr. Woofles Barking ]
- Mommy's coming.

808
00:46:31,546 --> 00:46:36,501
If an artist can, it gives us all a
much better chance, and he is an artist.

809
00:46:36,546 --> 00:46:39,944
- Is that why he's getting all hot
and bothered all the time?
- Artists are very emotional.

810
00:46:40,013 --> 00:46:42,774
- Artists are emotional, are they?
- Yes, they are.

811
00:46:42,813 --> 00:46:45,608
Hey, I've been meaning
to ask ya...

812
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:50,443
is it my imagination
or are you always... Iookin' my way?

813
00:46:50,513 --> 00:46:53,480
- You're a very observant girl.
Yes, I have been looking at you.
- Thank you.

814
00:46:53,513 --> 00:46:56,502
Yeah, well, I notice somethin'.
I notice you have...

815
00:46:56,546 --> 00:46:59,808
a really
big appetite.

816
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:03,313
- Yes, I do have a big appetite.
- Yeah, I noticed that, but--

817
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:05,437
- Where's your baby-sitter?
- What, Cheech?

818
00:47:05,513 --> 00:47:08,480
- Yes.
- Ah, you don't have to worry
about Cheech. He took off.

819
00:47:08,546 --> 00:47:12,569
- Did he?
- A minute there's a chance,
he runs off to play craps.

820
00:47:12,646 --> 00:47:16,044
- Takes about two hours.
- Well, listen, now that
you've been let off the leash...

821
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:18,745
- Yeah?
- why don't we go in...

822
00:47:18,813 --> 00:47:22,075
- and get to know each other
a bit better?
- Okay.

823
00:47:22,314 --> 00:47:24,836
That might be pleasant.
[ Giggles ]

824
00:47:29,846 --> 00:47:31,505
- [ Giggles ]
- Well.

825
00:47:31,579 --> 00:47:33,511
- Hi.
- Hi.

826
00:47:33,579 --> 00:47:35,772
Hi.

827
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,037
- You're a very attr--
Wait just a minute.
- What? What? What?

828
00:47:42,646 --> 00:47:44,908
- Before we start--
- Yeah?

829
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:47,276
- What? Oh.
- Just a--

830
00:47:47,347 --> 00:47:50,370
A little poultry.
[ Giggles ]
Okay.

831
00:47:50,447 --> 00:47:52,379
- All right. Let's go.
- All right.

832
00:47:52,447 --> 00:47:54,935
You do have a big appetite.
[ Giggles ]

833
00:47:55,013 --> 00:47:58,468
- Pull yourself together.
So he came up with a good idea.
- [ Sighs ]

834
00:47:58,513 --> 00:48:00,945
- Helen, not you too?
- If you did follow his suggestion...

835
00:48:01,013 --> 00:48:04,275
you'd be able to put in that new scene
in Act Ill that you've always wanted to.

836
00:48:04,347 --> 00:48:08,279
- Yes, but it'd--
- And that, that casts
a whole new light...

837
00:48:08,347 --> 00:48:10,744
on my relationship
with my husband. Yes!

838
00:48:10,813 --> 00:48:13,439
So you're saying
you want me to change it?

839
00:48:13,513 --> 00:48:16,911
At the risk of seeing you
upset on your birthday.

840
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:19,639
- How did you know it was my birthday?
- Happy birthday.

841
00:48:19,713 --> 00:48:22,907
- Helen! Ohh.
- Open it.

842
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:25,571
Gosh!

843
00:48:25,646 --> 00:48:28,942
Oh, gosh.
Really. It's--

844
00:48:29,013 --> 00:48:31,740
Don't get too excited.
I didn't buy it.

845
00:48:31,813 --> 00:48:34,779
Cole Porter gave it to me.
It's one of many.

846
00:48:34,846 --> 00:48:37,438
- Now I'm gonna have to take up smoking.
- Hmm.

847
00:48:37,513 --> 00:48:40,570
Have a good time tonight
with your girlfriend.
I'm sure she's taking you out.

848
00:48:40,646 --> 00:48:44,738
- Yes, with the Marxes.
- Yes, well... make a birthday wish.

849
00:48:44,813 --> 00:48:49,609
- I have.
- I hope you get everything
in life that you want.

850
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,612
Helen, have you thought
about what I said before...

851
00:48:51,646 --> 00:48:53,874
- about the way I feel?
- Don't speak.

852
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:58,410
- But I want to express--
- Don't speak. Don't.

853
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:01,912
- Just a few things I want to tell you.
- Don't speak.

854
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:04,912
- When we first met-- [ Muffled ]
- No, no. Don't speak.

855
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:08,037
Please don't speak.
Please don't speak.

856
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:11,007
No! No!
No! Go!

857
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:14,910
Go, gentle Scorpio, go!

858
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:19,345
Your Pisces wishes you
every happy return.

859
00:49:20,047 --> 00:49:22,343
- Just one--
- Don't speak!

860
00:49:22,414 --> 00:49:24,641
##

861
00:49:24,713 --> 00:49:28,668
- [ Sighs ]
- Wow, a wallet!

862
00:49:28,713 --> 00:49:31,702
- That's appropriate.
- It was the nicest one I saw by far.

863
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:35,042
- The piping. That's real leather.
- Places to put stuff in there.

864
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,075
- You like it?
- It's amazing. Beautiful.

865
00:49:37,314 --> 00:49:39,303
- You like it?
- Yes, really.

866
00:49:39,347 --> 00:49:43,302
- Now all I need is some money,
and it'll hold its shape.
- You will prosper, my friend.

867
00:49:43,347 --> 00:49:46,540
- I promise. [ Chuckles ]
Am I right, Hilda?
- No, I love it.

868
00:49:46,613 --> 00:49:49,977
- Can I pick 'em or can I pick 'em?
- Oh, you sure can, Julian.

869
00:49:50,047 --> 00:49:53,036
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you. Thank you.
Thanks for spending it with me.

870
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,609
- Oh, it's wonderful.
- Hilda, touch glasses there.

871
00:49:59,047 --> 00:50:02,604
Hey, look who's here
with his girlfriend.

872
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:05,942
- [ Ellen ] Oh, no.
- I owe that big Gorgonzola an apology.

873
00:50:06,013 --> 00:50:10,604
What are you talking about?
Now that he's drunk, he's gonna
apologize to everyone. Strangers.

874
00:50:10,646 --> 00:50:14,908
[ David ] Today at rehearsal,
he came up with that little
suggestion, and I overreacted.

875
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:18,776
I let my ego get in the way of the work,
and I feel I owe him an apology.

876
00:50:18,846 --> 00:50:22,370
- Ah, you're all right.
You handled it very well.
- I'll be right back.

877
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:33,607
I take it all back. It was a good
suggestion, and I apologize.

878
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,669
- Say hello to Violet.
- Hi, Violet.

879
00:50:35,746 --> 00:50:38,406
- Hi, nice to meet you.
Who's this, Cheech?
- He's a writer.

880
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:42,344
- I'm a struggling writer.
- You wanna know what the problem
with your story is?

881
00:50:42,414 --> 00:50:46,471
- What's the problem?
Are you gonna do some more rewrites?
- Sit down. Take a load off your feet.

882
00:50:46,513 --> 00:50:50,276
- Moe, go on. Come here. Get him a beer.
- Why not?

883
00:50:50,314 --> 00:50:52,303
- [ Violet ] He's a writer?
- Yeah.

884
00:50:52,347 --> 00:50:55,642
- I didn't know you knew writers.
- Do me a favor. Shut up.

885
00:50:55,713 --> 00:50:57,645
Don't tell me
to shut up.

886
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:00,044
All right,
number one.

887
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:03,405
See, I don't believe she loves
the guy right from the start.

888
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:06,934
She's too on, uh, top of him
all the time. That's not love.

889
00:51:07,013 --> 00:51:10,809
That's like keeping somebody in prison.
But if you changed it, right?

890
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:13,675
And she left him,
then she would feel so bad about it...

891
00:51:13,746 --> 00:51:17,610
- that she would have the
nervous breakdown and go nuts.
- [ Music Stops, Applause ]

892
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,442
- How ya doin', Cheech?
- Tulio, listen, I gotta see you later.

893
00:51:20,513 --> 00:51:23,968
- I wanna get down on the Cardinals
for the doubleheader, all right?
- You got it.

894
00:51:24,047 --> 00:51:28,309
- Them birds look good.
- Teach your friend some manners
and get him outta here.

895
00:51:28,347 --> 00:51:30,835
- All right, so--
- You were-- You were talking about--

896
00:51:30,913 --> 00:51:33,504
Right, all right.
So, now...

897
00:51:33,579 --> 00:51:37,636
if the doctor feels what Sylvia's
feelin'-- That's her name, Sylvia.

898
00:51:37,713 --> 00:51:40,043
- There's a Sylvia in my neighborhood.
- Oh, yeah?

899
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:43,541
-Yeah. What was her name? Sylvia Pincus.
-Sylvia Pincus.

900
00:51:43,613 --> 00:51:46,375
Sylvia Pincus. Big, fat Jewish broad,
had a little tiny husband.

901
00:51:46,447 --> 00:51:49,277
She chopped him up with an ax and mailed
his pieces all over the country.

902
00:51:49,347 --> 00:51:51,676
I don't know what
she was tryin' to prove.

903
00:51:51,746 --> 00:51:53,678
That's disgusting. You gotta
tell that story in front of me?

904
00:51:53,746 --> 00:51:55,372
- Relax.
- You know I got a weak stomach.

905
00:51:55,447 --> 00:51:57,912
- You were tellin' me
about the play a minute ago.
- Don't interrupt me.

906
00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:00,912
- You were sayin' about Sylvia?
- Right. So if the doctor feels
what Sylvia's feelin'--

907
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:02,969
- Uh-huh.
- Know what I mean?

908
00:52:03,047 --> 00:52:06,013
Yeah. She identifies
with her patient, a bit.

909
00:52:06,047 --> 00:52:09,843
Right. This way when she gets jealous,
it makes sense.

910
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:11,812
- Right.
- Uh-huh.

911
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:14,675
There's gotta be a time when the
Lieutenant has it out with the doctor.

912
00:52:14,746 --> 00:52:16,678
Why isn't that in there?

913
00:52:16,746 --> 00:52:18,871
You're talking about a whole
different direction for the play.

914
00:52:18,946 --> 00:52:20,878
Definitely.

915
00:52:22,613 --> 00:52:24,545
Think about it.

916
00:52:24,613 --> 00:52:28,376
How would the audience know
Sylvia was feeling guilty? lf--

917
00:52:28,447 --> 00:52:30,605
Oh. I don't know.

918
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,646
Wait a minute.
Yeah. Wait.

919
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:36,635
You could work it out with maybe you--
you hear what she's thinkin'.

920
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:39,612
-You mean she speaks her thoughts aloud?
-Sure, why not? It's a play anyhow.

921
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:42,771
It don't have to be real,
but it'll be stronger.

922
00:52:42,813 --> 00:52:46,609
You think about that.
And you, don't interrupt me no more.

923
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:48,612
I'm sorry.

924
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:54,971
So how come you had so much
to say to that Valenti goon?

925
00:52:55,047 --> 00:52:57,512
No, nothing. I was just
thanking him for his ideas.

926
00:52:57,546 --> 00:53:01,603
- What ideas? He only had
the one suggestion, didn't he?
- Yeah.

927
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:04,646
- That was just it.
- So do you like your wallet?

928
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:06,646
- What?
- The wallet.

929
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:08,976
- Oh, yes, yes, it's terrific.
- Are you sure?

930
00:53:09,013 --> 00:53:12,536
Oh, it's very exciting. I love
leatherette. Always have loved it.

931
00:53:12,613 --> 00:53:14,943
Boy, are you loaded.

932
00:53:15,013 --> 00:53:17,002
- Yeah.
- Happy birthday.

933
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:19,012
Thanks.

934
00:53:21,347 --> 00:53:26,279
[ David ] September 24. I gave the cast
the rewrites. Everyone seemed pleased.

935
00:53:26,347 --> 00:53:29,040
- [ Helen ] These are brilliant! Oh!
- [ Warner ] They are.

936
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,269
Now Sylvia's
not so passive.

937
00:53:31,347 --> 00:53:35,302
She uses her wiles to trap
the Lieutenant, and that's
what causes her guilt!

938
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:37,811
[ Warner ] The whole thing is motivated.
It drives on. Wonderful.

939
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:41,404
- [ Olive ] You mean I gotta
memorize all new lines?
- [ Helen ] They're wonderful!

940
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:45,707
- How did you come up
with such divine changes?
- They're not really mine--

941
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:49,712
- Oh, no? Whose are they, God's?
- [ Laughing ]

942
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:53,507
- Well, they are mine
in the sense that they're mine--
- Your modesty becomes you.

943
00:53:53,579 --> 00:53:55,738
But let's face it;
you are a major talent.

944
00:53:55,813 --> 00:53:57,870
A major new voice
in the theater.

945
00:53:57,946 --> 00:54:01,470
The word genius gets thrown around
so frequently in this business...

946
00:54:01,513 --> 00:54:03,945
- but, darling, if the shoe fits--
- Congratulations.

947
00:54:04,013 --> 00:54:07,945
- It finally has balls.
- Now, if we can do something
about Act Ill...

948
00:54:08,013 --> 00:54:10,411
we got a big, fat hit
on our hands.

949
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:14,310
- [ Warner ] Three cheers
for the writer! Hip-hip--
- [ Cast ] Hooray!

950
00:54:14,347 --> 00:54:17,540
[ David ] I stayed up all night
working on the third act.

951
00:54:17,613 --> 00:54:19,545
I admit it came rather hard...

952
00:54:19,613 --> 00:54:22,841
and before I handed in the pages,
I sent them over to Cheech to read.

953
00:54:22,913 --> 00:54:25,640
He suggested I come down
to his office.

954
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:32,372
- You missed the idea.
- I did?

955
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:35,004
Yeah, you did.
Plus, nobody talks like that.

956
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:38,512
- You got that problem.
You don't write like people talk.
- I take poetic license.

957
00:54:38,579 --> 00:54:43,274
Poetic license, bullshit.
People believe what they see
when the actors sound real.

958
00:54:43,347 --> 00:54:46,313
- Come here. Let me show you.
- What are you doing?

959
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:48,369
- What does it look like I'm doin'?
- You're gonna write it?

960
00:54:48,447 --> 00:54:52,640
What am l? A fuckin' idiot?
They taught me how to write in
school before I burned it down.

961
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:56,806
- You burned down your school?
- Yeah, it was Lincoln's birthday.
There was nobody there.

962
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,903
- If you actually write--
- Look, I know how people talk,
all right?

963
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:01,946
Go shoot a rack,
and let me do this.

964
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:04,775
But if you actually write it,
then I'm not--

965
00:55:04,846 --> 00:55:07,335
- Don't worry about it.
I ain't gonna tell anybody.
- No?

966
00:55:07,414 --> 00:55:10,346
No. I saw you playin' the big shot.
I know what it's all about.

967
00:55:10,414 --> 00:55:12,811
Where I come from,
nobody squeals.

968
00:55:18,513 --> 00:55:20,672
Go shoot a rack.

969
00:55:20,746 --> 00:55:23,076
Stop starin' at me.

970
00:55:23,314 --> 00:55:27,269
[ Helen ] What dialogue!
This is better than O'Neill!

971
00:55:27,347 --> 00:55:28,835
Max Anderson
will never touch you!

972
00:55:28,913 --> 00:55:30,845
So you liked it.

973

You hadn't found yourself yet. The idea
was there, but it hadn't crystallized.

You needed to hear it
on its feet, and now this.

It's no longer tepid

Good choice.

- Hi, Cheech! What are you doing here?

1117
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:13,542
Listen, usually I wouldn't give you
no warning, but you're a good actor.

1118
01:04:13,613 --> 01:04:16,738
You're doin' a good job, and it'll
be a big problem if you're not around.

01:04:16,813 --> 01:04:20,711
But I'm tellin' you right now:
lf you go near Nick Valenti's

1120
01:04:20,780 --> 01:04:24,542
I'm gonna stick my gun in your mouth
and blow a hole in the top of your head.

1121
01:04:24,613 --> 01:04:28,273
- All right?
- Cheech, it's so funny how you've
misconstrued the situation.

1122
01:04:28,347 --> 01:04:31,642
Listen to me. I said don't give me
no shit now, you hear?

- I understand, Mr. Cheech.
- You understand?

- I do understand, yes.
- Next time I come back angry.
You hear what I said?

- And next time you go near
her, you're a dead man.

Everyone seems to be
feeling the pressure of
our upcoming New York opening.

1245
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:28,935
Yesterday, Warner got into a
fight with Eden, and the results
proved Cheech right yet again.

1246
01:11:29,013 --> 01:11:32,775
There you are. Mr. Purcell,
you have been stealing our
dog yummies and eating them.

1247
01:11:32,813 --> 01:11:35,041
Absolutely not.
That's an outrageous suggestion.

1248
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:37,871
- Then let me see in your pockets.
- Would I eat dog food?

1249
01:11:37,946 --> 01:11:41,470
You'd eat anything that didn't eat
you first, you big fat pot of helium.

1250
01:11:41,513 --> 01:11:44,275
- This is the sort of food I eat:
prime loin chop.
- Let me see.

1251
01:11:44,347 --> 01:11:47,904
I do not steal from animals. Get out
of my trousers, you horrid woman.

1252
01:11:47,980 --> 01:11:50,469
Look!
Oh, thief, thief, thief!

1253
01:11:50,546 --> 01:11:52,774
It was you that drank
her saucer of milk yesterday.

1254
01:11:52,813 --> 01:11:56,540
Ow! Ow!
You fat hunk of blubber!

1255
01:11:56,613 --> 01:12:00,478
- She pushed me!
- Ow, my hand! That's 'cause
you were stealin' her dog food.

1256
01:12:00,546 --> 01:12:04,343
Somebody ought to stick
a harpoon in you, you big whale.

1257
01:12:04,414 --> 01:12:06,971
- Ow.
- I can get you a doctor.
I can get you a doctor.

1258
01:12:07,013 --> 01:12:08,979
I guess this means
you'll miss the matinee.

1259
01:12:09,013 --> 01:12:11,843
It's okay with me.
One show a day is plenty.

1260
01:12:11,913 --> 01:12:14,402
To think I didn't
believe you at first, you dear--

1261
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:19,276
I think I can say this in the company
of-- in the company of all of you.

1262
01:12:19,314 --> 01:12:24,440
That a woman of your age
should have leapt past the realm
of such acute narcissism.

1263
01:12:33,013 --> 01:12:35,570
- What a difference with
a real actress saying those lines!
- All right.

1264
01:12:35,646 --> 01:12:38,874
- The whole play came to life!
- Listen to me.

1265
01:12:38,946 --> 01:12:43,571
Don't get carried away.
Don't get any ideas. Olive is going on.

1266
01:12:43,646 --> 01:12:47,669
We can get all the backing
we need without Nick Valenti.
Our notices are wonderful.

1267
01:12:47,746 --> 01:12:50,507
- People are standing--
- It's not the money. I told ya that.

1268
01:12:50,579 --> 01:12:54,534
We dump Olive, you, me,
even the dog will wind up
at the bottom of the Hudson.

1269
01:12:54,613 --> 01:12:58,943
It won't take that long.
He'll kill us here in Boston.
We'll be at the bottom of the Charles.

1270
01:12:58,980 --> 01:13:02,276
He was right. She wrecks the whole play.
He noticed that.

1271
01:13:02,347 --> 01:13:06,608
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing. It's just that
she affects the whole play.

1272
01:13:08,013 --> 01:13:11,002
- [ David ] You were wonderful.
- Yes, yes. Wonderful.

1273
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:13,739
- [ Eden ] Have you seen
Deliah with my robe?
- Yes, she's coming.

1274
01:13:13,813 --> 01:13:16,574
- Listen.
- [ Sighing ]

1275
01:13:16,646 --> 01:13:20,010
- One thing you don't do
is welsh on Nick Valenti.
- On Nick Valenti.

1276
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:23,308
- In future productions,
we can hire somebody else.
- Shh-shh!

1277
01:13:23,380 --> 01:13:26,777
We can hire somebody else, but if she's
okay to open in New York, she opens.

1278
01:13:26,846 --> 01:13:29,971
- I mean, the play must go on.
I'll do anything--
- She affected the whole thing.

1279
01:13:38,713 --> 01:13:41,475
[ Helen ] I can't tell you
how many times I've seen it.

1280
01:13:41,546 --> 01:13:43,512
A show comes into Boston...

1281
01:13:43,579 --> 01:13:48,511
crippled, limping, struggling, gasping
for air, trying to find its own life...

1282
01:13:48,579 --> 01:13:53,511
and then, somewhere along the line,
a miracle occurs.

1283
01:13:53,579 --> 01:13:55,602
A work of art is born.

1284
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:59,443
- It's amazing how much better the show
is working with Olive's understudy.
- Mmm, Olive.

1285
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:01,446
- The thing's breathing and living.
- Yes, it's true.

1286
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:05,071
She's drab, but it's still
going to be a fine, fat hit.

1287
01:14:05,314 --> 01:14:07,677
- Mmm.
- Here's to your future...

1288
01:14:07,713 --> 01:14:10,770
as the new white knight
of the Great White Way.

1289
01:14:12,314 --> 01:14:16,474
- Cheers.
- [ Coughing ]

1290
01:14:16,513 --> 01:14:20,639
- What is this stuff?
- Paint remover. You can cut
it with a little club soda.

1291
01:14:20,713 --> 01:14:22,645
- Oh, it's very smooth.
- Yes.

1292
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:26,075
See the little towns go by?

1293
01:14:28,513 --> 01:14:31,968
Helen, when I get back to New York,
I'm gonna tell Ellen about us.

1294
01:14:32,047 --> 01:14:34,479
- Oh, David!
- No, I've decided.

1295
01:14:34,513 --> 01:14:37,480
- Oh, are you sure?
- You know how I feel about you.

1296
01:14:37,513 --> 01:14:42,071
Oh, David, you must be gentle.
I-I-I've been hurt so many times before.

1297
01:14:42,314 --> 01:14:44,939
I know.
I know.

1298
01:14:45,013 --> 01:14:47,979
You stand on the brink
of greatness.

1299
01:14:48,047 --> 01:14:53,480
The world will open to you like an
oyster. No. No, not like an oyster.

1300
01:14:53,546 --> 01:14:56,808
The world will open to you
like a magnificent vagina.

1301
01:15:00,613 --> 01:15:02,704
You okay?
You look a little flushed.

1302
01:15:02,780 --> 01:15:05,303
- I've just had a little too much--
- Is it something I said?

1303
01:15:05,347 --> 01:15:07,938
- No, just the paint remover.
- Oh.

1304
01:15:08,013 --> 01:15:09,945
[ Sighs ]

1305
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:14,310
Have you ever thought about
whether, when you fall in love...

1306
01:15:14,347 --> 01:15:17,472
do you fall in love with
the artist or the man?

1307
01:15:19,447 --> 01:15:21,708
What a strange question.

1308
01:15:21,780 --> 01:15:23,712
Yes, it is strange, but--

1309
01:15:25,513 --> 01:15:30,412
I'm in love with you, Helen. I am, and
the time has come for me to act on it.

1310
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:33,502
Oh, the train
is moving so fast.

1311
01:15:33,579 --> 01:15:37,034
Oh, David, it's so fast.
Oh, hold me!

1312
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:40,041
- Oh, hold me. No, no, don't speak.
- Helen, I love you.

1313
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:42,768
Don't speak.
B-- Uh, please, don't speak.

1314
01:15:42,846 --> 01:15:45,641
- Don't speak. No. Don't speak.
- [ Muffled ]

1315
01:15:45,713 --> 01:15:47,679
No, please.

1316
01:15:47,746 --> 01:15:52,270
- Are you having an affair
with Helen Sinclair?
- What? No!

1317
01:15:52,314 --> 01:15:54,280
- Don't lie to me.
- What are you talking about?

1318
01:15:54,347 --> 01:15:57,676
You two are in every gossip column in
town. You were all over Boston together.

1319
01:15:57,746 --> 01:15:59,678
- You know those columns.
- All those late nights.

1320
01:15:59,746 --> 01:16:01,769
- I was working!
- What about this?

1321
01:16:01,846 --> 01:16:05,573
- That's a cigarette case I found.
I don't know where I found it.
- "To Helen from Cole.

1322
01:16:05,646 --> 01:16:08,840
- Let's do it.
- I remember now. I admired it,
and she gave it to me.

1323
01:16:08,913 --> 01:16:11,902
-Why didn't you tell me?
-Because there's nothing to tell, Ellen.

1324
01:16:11,980 --> 01:16:16,379
Now that you're on the eve
of success, you want to dump me
and go off with Helen Sinclair.

1325
01:16:16,447 --> 01:16:19,436
- That is ri-- That is ridiculous.
- Are you sure?

1326
01:16:19,513 --> 01:16:21,741
You know how crazy
you sound right now?

1327
01:16:21,813 --> 01:16:25,302
- You never encouraged me
to stay in Boston.
- I was submerged in my work.

1328
01:16:25,347 --> 01:16:28,438
The play's in trouble.
I'm working.

1329
01:16:28,513 --> 01:16:30,604
Hey, it's me.
It's David.

1330
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:32,976
You know?
David? Okay?

1331
01:16:34,846 --> 01:16:37,369
What an imagination
on this girl.

1332
01:16:38,913 --> 01:16:42,538
[ David ] Listen, Flender,
I'm completely mixed up.

1333
01:16:42,613 --> 01:16:45,909
Ellen, Ellen. I love Ellen.
She's been with me the whole time.

1334
01:16:45,980 --> 01:16:48,502
Stuck by me. I knew she'd
be happier back in Pittsburgh.

1335
01:16:48,579 --> 01:16:50,602
- We've had a great relationship.
- Right.

1336
01:16:50,646 --> 01:16:53,806
- I love her dearly. And yet--
- Yeah. Yes. Get to the point.

1337
01:16:53,846 --> 01:16:57,040
What is the problem here? It's always
been clear that you've loved Ellen.

1338
01:16:57,280 --> 01:17:00,837
I've become involved with
Helen Sinclair, and I feel terrible.

1339
01:17:00,913 --> 01:17:05,811
But I can't help myself.
She's so charismatic, and
she's brilliant and beautiful.

1340
01:17:05,846 --> 01:17:08,937
I mean, a real artist, and--
and we speak the same language.

1341
01:17:09,013 --> 01:17:10,979
- You're wracked with guilt.
- I'm wracked with guilt.

1342
01:17:11,013 --> 01:17:13,979
- You're wracked with guilt.
You are wracked with guilt.
- I don't know whether--

1343
01:17:14,013 --> 01:17:18,502
- I can't sleep.
- Guilt is petit bourgeois crap.

1344
01:17:18,579 --> 01:17:22,410
- An artist creates
his own moral universe.
- I know that. I know--

1345
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:26,412
Well? What is the problem then?
I'm gonna give you some advice.

1346
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:30,809
The same advice that was
given to me many years ago when
I had a very similar dilemma.

1347
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:32,971
- Similar to mine. To--
- Yes. Yes.

1348
01:17:33,047 --> 01:17:35,013
What did you do?
What?

1349
01:17:35,047 --> 01:17:37,808
You gotta do
what you gotta do.

1350
01:17:40,613 --> 01:17:45,636
##

1351
01:17:45,713 --> 01:17:48,009
Hot ginger and dynamite

1352
01:17:48,047 --> 01:17:49,979
There's nothing
but that at night

1353
01:17:50,047 --> 01:17:52,070
Back in Nagasaki where
the fellas chew tobaccy

1354
01:17:52,314 --> 01:17:54,541
And the women
wicky wacky woo

1355
01:17:54,613 --> 01:17:57,375
- The way they can entertain
- [ Nick ] She's great in the show, huh?

1356
01:17:57,447 --> 01:17:59,379
- Would hurry a hurricane
- [ Marx ] Oh, the best.

1357
01:17:59,447 --> 01:18:01,503
- Back in Nagasaki
- She'll take Broadway by storm.

1358
01:18:01,579 --> 01:18:05,636
- And the women wicky wacky woo#
- The part is modest. Still--

1359
01:18:05,713 --> 01:18:09,645
Listen, when she gets here, tell her
you're gonna give her some new lines.

1360
01:18:09,713 --> 01:18:12,407
- You know, like we discussed.
- Yeah.

1361
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:15,843
Let me level with you, Mr. V.
Do you mind if I call you Nick?

1362
01:18:15,913 --> 01:18:18,902
You see, Nick, you don't
fiddle with a winning show.

1363
01:18:18,980 --> 01:18:21,844
Every script reaches a point where,
in the professional judgment...

1364
01:18:21,913 --> 01:18:24,311
of the producer, the director,
you're finished.

1365
01:18:24,347 --> 01:18:26,710
You can't distort the plot.
[ Chuckles ]

1366
01:18:26,780 --> 01:18:30,507
Now, we're about ready to open.
Changes could be harmful.

1367
01:18:30,579 --> 01:18:32,636
No, the show is
basically frozen.

1368
01:18:34,780 --> 01:18:37,474
- Let's avoid confusion.
- Sure.

1369
01:18:37,513 --> 01:18:39,480
She'll get some new
fuckin' lines...

1370
01:18:39,513 --> 01:18:42,502
or I'll nail your kneecaps
to the dance floor.

1371
01:18:44,913 --> 01:18:48,368
Imagine that director telling me
I'm overacting in the first scene...

1372
01:18:48,447 --> 01:18:50,571
and I don't know
what I'm saying.

1373
01:18:50,646 --> 01:18:54,443
You know what I'm doing, Cheech, is,
I'm working on a superior laugh. Like:

1374
01:18:54,513 --> 01:18:57,775
Ha-ha-ha. Hee-hee-hee.
[ Chuckles ]

1375
01:18:57,846 --> 01:19:02,574
I wanna throw that in when
Sylvia threatens to leave,
and then I burst into tears.

1376
01:19:02,646 --> 01:19:07,443
Well, you know, he says no,
but what the hell kind of dull
show is he putting on anyway?

1377
01:19:07,513 --> 01:19:10,946
- I don't know.
- Where we goin'? I thought
we were gonna go meet Nick.

1378
01:19:11,013 --> 01:19:13,604
[ Cheech ]
We have to go pick up Nick.

1379
01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:17,374
We're gonna pick up Nick? You never
said nothin' about picking him up.

1380
01:19:17,447 --> 01:19:20,810

the other day, which I'm sure
that you probably knew.

- Yes, he's been in love
with me for a long time.

is relational, that it requires two--

1461
01:23:48,980 --> 01:23:50,946
the artist
and the audience?

1462

- He feels that way about sex too.
- About-- About sex?

1463
01:23:53,080 --> 01:23:56,308
Yes, between the two right people,
it can become an art form.

1464
01:23:56,380 --> 01:24:00,539
Are you saying that you and
Flender have raised intercourse
to the level of an art form?

1465
01:24:00,613 --> 01:24:02,545
Not just intercourse.

01:27:20,846 --> 01:27:24,778
Yeah. It's all right.
We'll take care of those Kustabeck guys.

1519
01:27:24,846 --> 01:27:28,642
- I wonder if it really was
the Kustabecks.
- Well, who else?

1520
01:27:28,713 --> 01:27:33,271
I don't know.
But we got some tips...

1521
01:27:33,347 --> 01:27:36,074
- that Charlie K. had
nothin' to do with this.
- Really.

1522
01:27:36,314 --> 01:27:39,075
Yeah. Don't make
no sense anyhow.

1523
01:27:39,314 --> 01:27:43,371
I mean, the way things
were coolin' off and all.

1524
01:27:43,447 --> 01:27:46,038
I'll see what I can find out
on the street, ya know?

1525
01:27:46,280 --> 01:27:49,768
- Where you rushin' off to?
- Hey, you know, I told
the guys in the show...

1526
01:27:49,846 --> 01:27:52,505
that I, uh, I'd stop by
and wish 'em good luck.

1527
01:27:52,579 --> 01:27:55,410
- I got friendly with
some of the stage hands.
- Did you?

1528
01:27:55,480 --> 01:27:57,536
- Yeah.
- That's unlike you.

1529
01:27:57,613 --> 01:27:59,545
- Why's that?
- Unless they shoot crap.

1530
01:27:59,613 --> 01:28:02,875
No, you know, you see
the same faces every day. You know.

1531
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:08,972
Marty Bannister said he saw you pick
up Olive the night she got it, Cheech.

1532
01:28:09,047 --> 01:28:11,979
- Me?
- Didn't you tell me you didn't see her?

1533
01:28:12,013 --> 01:28:13,979
Me? Yeah,
I said I did.

1534
01:28:14,013 --> 01:28:18,775
I picked her up, and I dropped her off
a few blocks from the theater. Why?

1535
01:28:18,846 --> 01:28:21,812
- You had nothin' against Olive, did ya?
- Olive? Naw.

1536
01:28:21,880 --> 01:28:24,903
- I like Olive. Why?
- I mean, you got along well?

1537
01:28:24,980 --> 01:28:27,276
Olive and l, we got along good.
You know, Olive.

1538
01:28:27,347 --> 01:28:29,279
Olive was good for
a lot of laughs, right?

1539
01:28:29,314 --> 01:28:31,506
- Except for a few tiffs here and there?
- Right.

1540
01:28:31,579 --> 01:28:33,568
Olive's-- You know.
We got along.

1541
01:28:35,380 --> 01:28:38,312
How come you didn't bring her
to me at the club, Cheech?

1542
01:28:38,347 --> 01:28:42,302
She said you changed your mind, that
I should drop her off at the theater.

1543
01:28:42,347 --> 01:28:45,972
- The theater. At night?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1544
01:28:46,013 --> 01:28:49,309
There was no preview
that night, Cheech. No rehearsal.

1545
01:28:49,380 --> 01:28:51,641
Really?

1546
01:28:51,713 --> 01:28:54,873
How come you
left her alone, Cheech?

1547
01:28:54,946 --> 01:28:57,639
- [ Laughs ]
- And you didn't come
to the club and tell me?

1548
01:28:57,713 --> 01:29:01,543
I'm gonna level with you, all right?
I had a crap game.
I didn't want to miss it.

1549
01:29:01,613 --> 01:29:03,909
- Mmm.
- Yeah.

1550
01:29:03,980 --> 01:29:07,378
- Why you don't tell me?
- You wanna lay off?
I'm up to here in debts.

1551
01:29:07,447 --> 01:29:09,379
- I'm tryin' to get even.
- Yeah?

1552
01:29:09,447 --> 01:29:12,606
Yeah. Dice ain't been too lucky for me.
You know. You know how it is.

1553
01:29:12,646 --> 01:29:15,771
You keep tellin' me I gotta quit.
Ya know, I should.

1554
01:29:15,846 --> 01:29:17,778
- Cheech--
- Listen, listen.

1555
01:29:17,813 --> 01:29:21,041
I told the guys I'd wish them good luck
in the show. They're very superstitious.

1556
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:24,303
I'm gonna find out who hit her,
all right? I'll find out.

1557
01:29:24,380 --> 01:29:26,471
All right.
I'll see ya later.

1558
01:29:31,579 --> 01:29:34,568
He did it, Nick.
I don't know what his grudge was.

1559
01:29:34,646 --> 01:29:37,306
Maybe they were
two-timin' ya.

1560
01:29:37,347 --> 01:29:39,869
- What are you sayin' to me?
- Take it easy, Nick.

1561
01:29:39,946 --> 01:29:43,071
It's only a guess.
But Marty Bannister saw them together...

1562
01:29:43,314 --> 01:29:45,745
and that pier is
Cheech's favorite spot.

1563
01:29:45,813 --> 01:29:48,643
Can't you see he was lyin', Nickie?
Did you see the look on his face?

1564
01:29:48,713 --> 01:29:52,907
- He was scared.
- Look, Nick, I know you
don't like to think it...

1565
01:29:52,980 --> 01:29:56,639
- but the gossip is, she
was runnin' around on ya.
- Don't say that!

1566
01:29:56,680 --> 01:29:59,476
- I'm only tryin' to help, Mr. V.
- Nickie.

1567
01:29:59,546 --> 01:30:01,479
He's only tryin'
to help.

1568
01:30:03,080 --> 01:30:05,012
Cheech and Olive.

1569
01:30:06,447 --> 01:30:08,503
Fix him.

1570
01:30:08,579 --> 01:30:12,273
Oh, it's goin' great.

1571
01:30:12,314 --> 01:30:16,507
Yeah, they're eating it up. Before,
I could smell money. Now I can taste it.

1572
01:30:16,579 --> 01:30:18,977
- [ David ] Mmm, yeah.
- Hey, what's the matter?

1573
01:30:19,047 --> 01:30:22,445
You look as though you're watchin'
a turkey. It's just the opposite.

1574
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:25,912
- Where's Ellen?
- Oh, she was too nervous to come.

1575
01:30:25,980 --> 01:30:28,775
[ Warner ] This is
Dr. Emilene Philips, a family friend.

1576
01:30:28,813 --> 01:30:30,938
- Hey. How's it goin'?
- Cheech, how are ya?

1577
01:30:31,013 --> 01:30:34,604
Goin' great. Wonderful.
You need to cheer him up. I don't know.

1578
01:30:34,680 --> 01:30:36,646
- What's the matter?
- What do you want?

1579
01:30:36,680 --> 01:30:39,771
- It's goin' great, huh?
- You killed Olive, Cheech.

1580
01:30:39,813 --> 01:30:41,904
For that I can never
forgive you.

1581
01:30:41,980 --> 01:30:44,741
I don't care what kind of
genius you are.

1582
01:30:44,813 --> 01:30:48,575
Listen to that audience. Huh? They got
'em right in the palm of their hand.

1583
01:30:48,646 --> 01:30:51,510
Hey, Cheech. It's over for you.
You're finished.

1584
01:30:51,579 --> 01:30:53,511
[ Eden ] I had such
a wonderful time.

1585
01:30:53,579 --> 01:30:57,875
[ Ellen ] I can't live like this,
the same routine over and over.

1586
01:30:57,946 --> 01:31:01,810
You think the same thing's not gonna
happen to you as happened to me?

1587
01:31:01,846 --> 01:31:04,835
You think you're not gonna be here
sitting with a hole in your sweater...

1588
01:31:04,913 --> 01:31:06,845
and a drink in your hand
someday?

1589
01:31:06,913 --> 01:31:10,402
- Just wait!
- Cheech! You should be out front.

1590
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:13,570
You're about to miss my great scene.
Did you see the first part?

1591
01:31:13,646 --> 01:31:18,578
- How did it go?
Do you think they like it?
- [ Cheech ] Great, great.

1592
01:31:18,646 --> 01:31:22,942
- Where's Cheech?
- Get the fuck outta here.
Get outta here.

1593
01:31:23,013 --> 01:31:26,570
- Sucker.

Continues lndistinctly ]

01:31:28,980 --> 01:31:32,037

the last time, Cheech.
- [ Eden ] I think he's--

1595
01:31:32,280 --> 01:31:35,405
I'm in the garden, Sylvia,
tending roses.

1596
01:31:35,480 --> 01:31:38,604
[ Helen ] Oh, darling,
if we just had a baby.

1597
01:31:38,680 --> 01:31:42,306
- That's all I think about.
- [ Warner ] We've been
through all this before.

- Yes?

01:31:54,347 --> 01:31:57,608
Tell Sylvia Poston...

1603
01:31:59,613 --> 01:32:02,273
to say she's pregnant.

1604
01:32:03,913 --> 01:32:07,504
It'll be a great finish.

1605

- Oh, God, that's so great.
- No. Don't speak.

01:32:12,414 --> 01:32:14,346
Don't speak.

One of the greatest moments of this

when the Lieutenant returns

The big Broadway success.

I don't write hits.
My plays are art.

- I have to--
I have to ask you a question.
- What?

1628
01:33:42,813 --> 01:33:45,473
Did you love me as the artist
or as the man?

1629
01:33:45,546 --> 01:33:49,535
- Both.
- Well, what if it turned out
that I wasn't really an artist?

1630
01:33:49,613 --> 01:33:52,478
I could love a man if
he's not a real artist...

1631

but I couldn't love an artist
if he's not a real man.

- Yes.

- Hey! Flender is a great lover.
- Ohh.

1635
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:08,844
- Hey, I slept with Flender.
He was just okay.
- [ Ellen ] Really?

1636
01:34:08,913 --> 01:34:11,572
[ Flender ] Rita, please!
What are you talking about?

1637
01:34:11,646 --> 01:34:13,578
That was years ago, during
your free-love period.

1638
01:34:13,646 --> 01:34:16,635
[ Ellen ] I feel it's relational.
For me, he's great.

1639
01:34:16,713 --> 01:34:19,941
Huh, interesting. Are you talking
pure mechanics or what?

1640
01:34:20,013 --> 01:34:22,479
- His technique is prodigious.
- [ Flender ] Prodigious?

1641
01:34:22,513 --> 01:34:26,775
- You're confusing sex and love.
- No, for me, love is very deep.

1642
01:34:26,846 --> 01:34:28,778
Sex only has to go
a few inches.

1643

Y-You're all missing the point.
The point is, I can give
pleasure many times a day.

1644
01:34:33,846 --> 01:34:36,903
Oh, now really, Flender.
What has quantity got to do with it?

1645
01:34:36,980 --> 01:34:39,775
- Quantity affects quality.
- [ David ] Says who?

1646
01:34:39,813 --> 01:34:42,677
- Karl Marx.
- [ Rita ] Oh, so now
we're talking economics.

1647
01:34:42,746 --> 01:34:46,372
- Sex is economics.
- Bullshit. Ellen, come down here.
I wanna talk to you.

1648
01:34:46,447 --> 01:34:49,571
I love you. I wanna see you.
Come down here.

1649
01:34:49,646 --> 01:34:52,612
- All right.
- What do you mean "All right"?
What about me?

1650
01:34:52,680 --> 01:34:55,646
You're great, Flender, but it's no use.
I'll never get over David.

1651
01:34:55,680 --> 01:34:59,443
Couldn't you tell? Each time
I climaxed, I'd scream, "David! David!"

1652
01:34:59,480 --> 01:35:01,570
I thought you were saying,
"Do it! Do it!"

1653
01:35:01,646 --> 01:35:04,544
Flender, stop it.
Leave 'em alone.

1654
01:35:04,613 --> 01:35:06,943
Can't you see
they love each other?

1655
01:35:11,646 --> 01:35:14,737
I'm finished with it:
living in the garrets...
