00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:07,424
Honey, you got the baby?

2
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:12,536
Yeah, yeah, I got the...

3
00:01:12,605 --> 00:01:14,095
I'll get the baby.
I thought you had him.

4
00:01:24,617 --> 00:01:26,847
Coming. Coming.

5
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,852
Oh!

6
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:49,439
Daddy's got you.

7
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:50,533
Where's my kiss?

8
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,669
Come on. Come on.

9
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,581
Come on. Come on.

10
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:00,451
You're doing it wrong.

11
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,646
What are you talking about?

12
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:02,881
You don't even know what I'm doing.

13
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,150
I can tell by the cry.

14
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:05,816
Come on, take Kelly.

15
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:14,660
Come on, take Kelly.
I got this.

16
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:15,792
Go ahead.

17
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:18,702
Hey, my big boy... Hi.

18
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:30,538
Aw...

19
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:33,347
That's my big boy.

20
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:34,647
Oh, yes...

21
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:36,382
<i>Hi, I'm Richard Cooper.</i>

22
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:38,048
<i>And that's my wife Brenda.</i>

23
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:41,787
<i>We have two incredible
children, Brian and Kelly.</i>

24
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:44,352
<i>We've been married
close to seven years.</i>

25
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,194
<i>My wife is beautiful,
intelligent</i>

26
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:48,359
<i>and a great mother.</i>

27
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:50,163
<i>It's the perfect life.</i>

28
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:52,670
<i>There's just one problem:</i>

29
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:56,106
<i>I'm bored out of my fucking mind.</i>

30
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:59,612
<i>Now, I'm sure I'd have
a much rosier outlook on life</i>

31
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,806
<i>if my wife and I
actually had sex,</i>

32
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:04,008
<i>but there always
seems to be something wrong.</i>

33
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:05,675
No, my face hurts.

34
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:08,220
It's not your birthday.

35
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:19,094
<i>We both work, we're both tired,
but that's no excuse.</i>

36
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:21,224
<i>To be honest, I don't know</i>

37
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:23,098
<i>how much more of this I can take.</i>

38
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:26,002
Richard, do you think
perhaps you work too much?

39
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:26,970
Oh, no, no, no.

40
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,405
I- I work, too. I do.

41
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:30,669
But I come home from work, and
I have to take care of the kids,

42
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:32,040
and I have to take care of you.

43
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:33,339
And frankly, I'm tired.

44
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:34,437
I'm tired.

45
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:36,448
Too tired to wear
a nice pair of panties?

46
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:37,676
What's wrong with my panties?

47
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,876
They're huge!

48
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:40,749
You know, the biggest thing
on a pair of panties

49
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:41,980
should be the tag.

50
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,784
That's all I want to see:
tag and ass.

51
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:44,823
Tag and ass!

52
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,586
You see? You see?

53
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:48,126
- This is what I'm talking about.
- Mm-hmm.

54
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:49,593
You see how insensitive he is?

55
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:51,186
You know, Brenda,
maybe I'd be more sensitive

56
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:52,492
if you'd have sex with me.

57
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:53,930
It seems like the only time

58
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,900
she wants to have sex with me
is to make a baby.

59
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:57,800
The only time you want
to make a baby with me

60
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,269
is to have sex.

61
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:00,806
That doesn't make any sense!

62
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:02,170
Well, that's because I'm tired!

63
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,709
Now we're making progress.

64
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:07,569
<i>I hated that therapist.</i>

65
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:10,377
<i>She wasn't married
and didn't have any kids.</i>

66
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,781
<i>You know,</i>

67
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:14,649
<i>when you're on a plane,
you kind of want a pilot</i>

68
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,882
<i>with more experience than you.</i>

69
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:18,617
<i>But maybe that's just me.</i>

70
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:22,218
<i>Now, what I can't figure out
is how can my wife</i>

71
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:25,230
<i>not have sex with me,
and then send me out</i>

72
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:28,495
<i>into a world with so many
beautiful women?</i>

73
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:30,229
<i>That's like dropping me
into the ocean</i>

74
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:32,794
<i>and expecting me to not get wet.</i>

75
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:35,397
<i>I mean, every single woman
that I see</i>

76
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:37,875
<i>I have an imaginary
relationship with.</i>

77
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:38,968
<i>Like this one.</i>

78
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:41,445
<i>Ah, she's got beautiful lips.</i>

79
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:43,982
<i>But if we got married,
how long would it be</i>

80
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,518
<i>before I got tired of those lips?</i>

81
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:47,780
<i>How long would it be</i>

82
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:50,516
<i>before those lips
called me an asshole?</i>

83
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,491
<i>And look at her.</i>

84
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:54,992
<i>What a smile.</i>

85
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:56,619
<i>She looks happy now,</i>

86
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:58,687
<i>but if I was married to her
for eight years,</i>

87
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:00,460
<i>I'djust be thinking about
that phone bill.</i>

88
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:01,591
I don't know.

89
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:04,034
<i>And look at her.</i>

90
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:06,663
<i>Look at those eyes,
those cheekbones.</i>

91
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:10,937
<i>She's like a painting...
a painting I'd love to mount.</i>

92
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:23,481
<i>No matter where my head is,</i>

93
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:26,116
<i>when I get to Manhattan, I'm fine.</i>

94
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:28,956
<i>I love the city, rats and all.</i>

95
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:30,859
<i>I love myjob.</i>

96
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,455
<i>I'm an investment banker
at a mid-size firm.</i>

97
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:35,592
<i>I'm one of the only blacks
at the company.</i>

98
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:38,432
<i>As a matter of fact,
there are so few blacks here,</i>

99
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:42,099
<i>I think I know every black
person that works for the firm.</i>

100
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,574
Morning, Pam.

101
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:45,634
Howdy, Mr. Cooper.

102
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,945
Morning, Ron.

103
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,312
Good morning, Richard.

104
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:02,420
#Yo, fuck the cracker #

105
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,894
#That's what I say #

106
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:06,830
#And fuck these bitches
that always want to play #

107
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:09,527
# I'm the type of nigga
that is never gay #

108
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:12,400
# If you fuck with me, I'll
put your head in cake #

109
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:15,407
# If you fuck with me, I'll
shoot your moms at your wake #

110
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:17,966
# If you fuck with me,
you made a big mistake. #

111
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:48,640
Okay.

112
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:52,371
Tracy...

113
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:55,278
this is what we're
doing today, all right?

114
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:56,474
Seen George?

115
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:58,073
I'm right here.

116
00:06:58,151 --> 00:06:59,379
See you later, Mary.

117
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:02,114
George, your wife is on
the phone, and Veronica called.

118
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:03,746
Wife? I don't want to talk to her.

119
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:05,381
Find out what she wants.

120
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:06,891
Call back Veronica.

121
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,551
Rich, you want to
go over that stuff

122
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:09,617
before Landis gets in?

123
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:10,821
Sure,just,
uh, take off your coat...

124
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:12,296
Good morning, everyone.

125
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:14,458
Cooper, how's the Coleman account?

126
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:16,126
Incredible. The Narco funds are up.

127
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:17,328
All right.

128
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:20,304
Let's get to work, people.

129
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,574
<i>Pupkin & Langford. Please hold.</i>

130
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:26,634
<i>Pupkin & Langford.</i>

131
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:28,873
Lunch?

132
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,709
Well, I got to ask.

133
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,218
Come on, you know I hate the crowds.

134
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,879
By the time you get your
food, you got to come back.

135
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,150
Well, have fun all by yourself.

136
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:40,818
I'm gonna get a quick bite and
then get on the Coleman account.

137
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:43,521
See ya.

138
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:45,120
<i>Hey, I got nothing against George,</i>

139
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:46,859
<i>but I just hate going to lunch</i>

140
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:49,299
<i>at the same time
everybody else does.</i>

141
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:50,926
<i>It's just way too crowded.</i>

142
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:53,665
<i>Look at this mess.</i>

143
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:56,173
<i>It's just not the New York
that I like.</i>

144
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,746
<i>Now, at 2:00,
it's a different story.</i>

145
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,747
<i>Things slow down.</i>

146
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,511
<i>That's when I like to go out.</i>

147
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:07,951
<i>I can eat,
or I can go shopping,</i>

148
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,920
<i>or I can just clear my head.</i>

149
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:13,220
<i>And I can also watch women
and get a good look.</i>

150
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:15,988
<i>'Cause I know I will never
see them again.</i>

151
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:18,553
<i>Now,you can't look
at a woman in the suburbs.</i>

152
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:20,656
<i>You stare at a soccer mom
too long,</i>

153
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:24,225
<i>and they'll post your name
on the Internet.</i>

154
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:37,042
Can I help you find something?

155
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:39,209
Just looking.

156
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:44,851
Have you seen the new Prada suits?

157
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:47,051
No, that's okay, that's okay.

158
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:51,654
Excuse me, sir, would you like to try
a new fragrance today?

159
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:52,663
Nah, that's okay.

160
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:53,756
Oh.

161
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,767
Hey! Don't spray that shit on me.

162
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:58,531
It's really good.

163
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,937
Hi, I'm Candy.

164
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,843
Can I help you with something?

165
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:08,505
Do you have this in blue?

166
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:12,517
You know, I think you
should try this green one.

167
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:13,847
Uh, I-I don't really wear green.

168
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,447
Okay, but this green is hot.

169
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:18,455
Come on. Trust me.

170
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:19,582
Let's go try it on.

171
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:21,684
I'm telling you, I don't like green.

172
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,799
That looks great on you.

173
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:29,800
You think so?

174
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:31,666
Absolutely.
It's sexy.

175
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:32,669
I love it.

176
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,797
I just don't like wearing green.

177
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:36,432
Yeah, but you should
start wearing green.

178
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:38,773
I mean, you look
really handsome in it.

179
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:40,505
Hey, Lisa.

180
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,207
Will you tell him
how this shirt looks.

181
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:44,044
Oh, I love it on you!

182
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:45,606
I'm-I'm not just saying that.

183
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:48,279
I think it looks great on you.

184
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:51,919
Daddy's home.

185
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:53,424
Daddy's home.

186
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:54,789
Daddy!

187
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,191
Yeah!

188
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,559
Daddy's home.

189
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,530
Hey, Daddy.

190
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,566
How's it going?

191
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:01,565
Pretty good.

192
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:02,566
Where's Brian?

193
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:04,102
Oh, he's upstairs napping.

194
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,933
Oh, hey, I've got
all these tests to grade,

195
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:07,336
so can you do the dishes tonight?

196
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:08,464
- Yeah, yeah, no problem.
- Great.

197
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:09,667
Hey, Kelly.

198
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:11,232
Hi, Daddy.

199
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,868
How big is Kelly?

200
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,037
This big.

201
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,375
Yeah. Where's Kelly's ear?

202
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,416
Here.

203
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:19,713
- Where's Kelly's nose?
- Here.

204
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,582
Where's Kelly's esophagus?

205
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,890
Give the kid a break;
she's only three.

206
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,187
Hey, there's white
kids that are three

207
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,454
taking the bar right now.

208
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:31,758
W- H-I-T-E, please.

209
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:33,059
Okay, okay.

210
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,362
Hey, Kelly, I got you.

211
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:36,560
Daddy got you.

212
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,661
- Right upside the head.
- You went shopping? Huh.

213
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:40,569
Daddy got you.

214
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,107
I thought you didn't like green.

215
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:44,734
Figured I'd get something new.

216
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:48,177
It's different.

217
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:49,714
Pretty.

218
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:53,009
<i>There were days
when Brenda and I got along great.</i>

219
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:54,677
<i>But we still weren't having sex.</i>

220
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:57,314
<i>When a married couple
stops having sex,</i>

221
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,857
<i>at first, they complain about it.</i>

222
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:02,121
<i>But after a while,
they get used to it.</i>

223
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:04,560
<i>She walks out of the shower,
you don't even look.</i>

224
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:08,396
<i>'Cause you know there's
nothing there for you.</i>

225
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:09,866
<i>The most dangerous time</i>

226
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:12,927
<i>in a marriage
is when the couple accepts</i>

227
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,495
<i>that they're not having sex.</i>

228
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:16,234
Speak up; I'm in an elevator.

229
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:18,333
Richard, there's someone here to see you.

230
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:20,276
Uh, a client?

231
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,438
She didn't say.

232
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:29,486
Nikki?

233
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:32,456
<i>Wow, Nikki Tru.</i>

234
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,686
<i>I haven't seen her in eight years.</i>

235
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,159
<i>She was my best friend's girl.</i>

236
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:38,753
<i>I was crazy about her.</i>

237
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:39,923
What's wrong?

238
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:41,398
You didn't think you'd see me again?

239
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:43,560
No, it's not that;
I'm just surprised.

240
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:45,934
Wow, you look good, Nikki.

241
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:47,939
Thanks.

242
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:50,498
You know, people don't really
smoke in offices anymore.

243
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:51,838
I'm not really a smoker.

244
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:53,276
I'm just trying to lose some weight.

245
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:55,006
So what's that, a diet cigarette?

246
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,416
I'll put it out.

247
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:00,918
You look good, Richie.

248
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:02,613
That's a nice shirt.

249
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:04,087
Thanks.

250
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:06,989
So, wh-what brings
you around, Nikki?

251
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,856
I was in the neighborhood,
heard you worked in the area,

252
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:10,896
thought I'd stop by and say hi.

253
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:12,260
That's allowed, right?

254
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:14,595
Yeah. Hi.

255
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:16,134
Hi.

256
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:19,000
You want to show me
your office or something?

257
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,003
Come on.

258
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,300
Okay.

259
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:22,431
It's good to see you.

260
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:23,532
Yeah, you, too.

261
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:25,543
- Which way?
- This way.

262
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:27,772
<i>NI KKI
Are these your kids?</i>

263
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:29,576
Yeah, that's
my son Brian

264
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:31,548
and that's my daughter Kelly.

265
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:33,414
Same mother?

266
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:35,249
Same mother, my wife, seven years.

267
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:36,811
No side kids?

268
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:37,821
No side kids.

269
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,255
I know, it's very white of me.

270
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,827
Richard Marcus Cooper is married.

271
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:46,364
Tied the knot, till
death do you part.

272
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,491
Mm-hmm.

273
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:49,795
Something strange about that?

274
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:51,837
No. Just...

275
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:54,498
not the Richie I knew.

276
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:55,972
- People change.
- Hmm.

277
00:12:57,476 --> 00:12:59,068
You happily married?

278
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:01,636
Yeah, I'm-I'm happily married.

279
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:03,079
No, you're not.

280
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:04,241
You didn't say it right.

281
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:06,648
Okay, how was I supposed to say it?

282
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:08,050
Oh, I don't know.

283
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,883
But you're not supposed
to think about it.

284
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,855
I hear ice cracking.

285
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:13,084
What?

286
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,717
You ever walk across
a frozen river

287
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,762
and hear ice cracking?

288
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:18,820
It's the scariest sound
in the world.

289
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:19,865
Hey, hey.

290
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:21,194
My ice is fine.

291
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:23,701
My-my marriage is frozen solid.

292
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:25,760
You could do a triple axel
on my marriage.

293
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:27,828
One second.

294
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:29,204
Hello.

295
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:30,367
They're ready to start the meeting.

296
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:32,171
Yeah, yeah, I'll come right now.

297
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:34,576
So, to be
completely honest,

298
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,410
I do need a favor.

299
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:40,009
Ah. I knew Nikki didn't
come over here for nothing.

300
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:42,986
Well, I just got back in town,
and I'm trying to get a job,

301
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:44,750
but I need a reference.

302
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,052
Okay, well,
write up a letter,

303
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,615
bring it by, and I'll sign it.

304
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:48,955
No problem. Whoa!

305
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:51,892
Magic.

306
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:55,161
So you just knew
I would sign this, huh?

307
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:58,067
I figured a friend in
need, couldn't resist.

308
00:13:58,137 --> 00:13:59,126
Okay.

309
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:05,040
Good luck.

310
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,601
Thank you...

311
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,705
Mr. Married Man.

312
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:11,841
<i>Even though I hadn't seen Nikki</i>

313
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:13,646
<i>- in eight years, I got to say,
- Richard.</i>

314
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:16,051
<i>she looked even better
than I remembered.</i>

315
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:17,277
Gonna put these right
on top of the block.

316
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,119
Do I have to eat this, Mommy?

317
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,123
Kelly...
- Hey.

318
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,183
- Hey, Daddy.
- Hey, honey.

319
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:25,354
Mm.

320
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:26,557
I'm almost
done with them,

321
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:28,327
and dinner will be ready
in a few minutes, okay?

322
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,332
Is baked chicken okay?

323
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:30,333
Ah, you know chicken's great.

324
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:31,460
All right.

325
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,129
Where's my kiss?

326
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,139
Ooh, that's a good kiss.

327
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,902
What's up, Bri?

328
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:38,466
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

329
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,875
So how was school?

330
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:41,378
You know that test I was giving?

331
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:42,607
I had to give it again.

332
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:43,943
They all got A's.

333
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:45,711
Oh, um, Allison wants
to have a playdate

334
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:46,842
this weekend at her house.

335
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:49,046
Any B-L-A-C-K kids gonna be there?

336
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:51,146
A few. Not enough.

337
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,316
You know, I'm thinking of
joining a Mocha Moms group

338
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,654
in New Rochelle.

339
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:55,694
That'll be good.

340
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:57,092
I got to do something.

341
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:00,656
Hey, how was, um, work today?

342
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:01,893
Anything happen?

343
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:04,663
Ah, nothing much,just work.

344
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:05,897
<i>I'm not crazy.</i>

345
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:07,802
<i>Would you tell your wife
about Nikki?</i>

346
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:11,741
<i>But I got to admit, seeing
Nikki got me to thinking.</i>

347
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:14,335
<i>What would it be like
to be single again?</i>

348
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,313
<i>I mean, if I were single,</i>

349
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:18,907
<i>I wouldn't do all that
romance-and-flowers crap.</i>

350
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:22,784
<i>If I were single again,
I would get right to the point.</i>

351
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:24,789
Excuse me, would you
like to have sex with me?

352
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:26,791
- Of course I would.
- Well, come on!

353
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:29,487
<i>When you're single,you're
never at a loss for words.</i>

354
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:31,688
Excuse me, can I bite your ass?

355
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:32,856
For $1,000.

356
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,127
Come on, let's get biting, bitch!

357
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,896
<i>When you're single,
you have nothing to lose.</i>

358
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,528
Come with me to a hotel right now.

359
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:40,902
But I have an appointment.

360
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:42,702
Yeah, a pussy appointment.

361
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,437
<i>When you're single,
you're invincible.</i>

362
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:46,443
Excuse me...

363
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:48,104
Get the fuck out of here!

364
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,148
<i>When you're single,you're alone.</i>

365
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:51,807
I'll fuck you.

366
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:54,182
<i>And that's why I got married.</i>

367
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:01,293
<i>When I went to work
the next day,</i>

368
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,124
<i>being single was
the last thing on my mind.</i>

369
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:05,823
<i>I had a lot to do,</i>

370
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:08,025
<i>there was a big client
I wanted to bring in,</i>

371
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,330
<i>and I needed to be focused.</i>

372
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:14,765
<i>You know what I always say,</i>

373
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,570
valuation's an art not a science.

374
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:18,769
Hey, want to go to lunch?

375
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:20,778
I got a plan how we can
reel in EuroTech.

376
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:22,006
I'm gonna pass on the lunch,

377
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:23,708
but let's talk about it
when you get back.

378
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:25,875
Have fun with yourself.

379
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:27,179
Walter, listen,

380
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:28,810
I know you're in bed
with Cross and Lubitsch,

381
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:29,876
but I'm telling you right now,

382
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:31,252
you're gonna see
some things in the...

383
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:33,052
There's a Nikki Tru on line one.

384
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,285
Tell her to hold.

385
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,123
Well, I just
want you to know

386
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:38,959
that our doors are always open.

387
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:40,726
All right, take care, Walter.

388
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:43,594
Nikki.

389
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:46,137
Hey.

390
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:47,968
I got the job.

391
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,371
Good.

392
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:50,738
So as a thank you,

393
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:53,972
I was thinking you should
let me take you to lunch.

394
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:56,207
You know, I don't normally
do lunch till late.

395
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:57,976
Well, that's okay,
'cause I'm still in bed,

396
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:01,577
but I could get in the shower
and be to you in about an hour.

397
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:02,642
You know, I got

398
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:04,245
a lot of work to do, Nikki.

399
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:07,850
But you are gonna eat lunch, right?

400
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:09,757
So I'll be there at 2:00.

401
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:11,887
Okay?

402
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:12,953
Okay.

403
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:13,964
Good.

404
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,466
Bye.

405
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:19,934
Excuse me, miss, there's no smoking.

406
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:21,939
Okay, I'm putting it out.

407
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,904
I live on the West Side with Teddy.

408
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:27,570
He has a place here
and in D.C.,

409
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:29,580
although most of my stuff is in D.C.

410
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:31,980
So how'd you meet Teddy from D.C.?

411
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,018
He's a club promoter.

412
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:35,076
I met him out.

413
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:36,086
You know how it goes.

414
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:37,122
Yeah.

415
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:40,852
So do I know your wife?

416
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:42,826
I don't think so.

417
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,590
Is she white?

418
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:46,494
No.

419
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,123
Why-why would you ask that?

420
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:50,600
Don't get offended.

421
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:52,432
Remember that girl you brought
to Andre's party?

422
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:55,598
It was one girl at one party.

423
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:57,141
I- I go out with
one white girl,

424
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:58,471
all of a sudden, I'm Prince?

425
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:00,273
No, it was just a question.

426
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:02,336
I didn't mean anything by it.

427
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,117
So do you and your black wife
still fuck?

428
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:10,212
And what's it to you?

429
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:11,847
Mmm,just curious.

430
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,915
Most of the people I know
who are still married

431
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:16,119
say that after a while,
they don't fuck.

432
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:17,719
So do you love Teddy?

433
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:20,230
You didn't answer my question.

434
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:22,460
'Cause it's none
of your fucking business.

435
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:24,559
I'll take that as a no.

436
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:29,840
So, Mr. Married Man,

437
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:32,069
how did you meet
this black wife of yours?

438
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:33,372
You don't want to know.

439
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:34,878
No, I do.

440
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:35,971
Sort of.

441
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:38,209
I was...

442
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:41,548
coming from a meeting,
I was walking by the park,

443
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,817
<i>and she was there
with her class,</i>

444
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,949
<i>this beautiful woman
with these kids.</i>

445
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:48,788
<i>I don't know-
there was just something</i>

446
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:50,556
<i>really calm about her.</i>

447
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,824
<i>And I was like, "I got to meet her. "</i>

448
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:53,956
<i>Wow.</i>

449
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:56,592
I guess I was wrong.

450
00:18:56,668 --> 00:18:58,727
You do love your wife.

451
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,034
I've thought about it.

452
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:04,974
Doing the whole wife thing,
having kids.

453
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:07,068
I'm getting a little old
for the club scene.

454
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,080
I don't even know how you do it.

455
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,672
Hanging out late,

456
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:12,842
- eating cheeseburgers at 4:00 in the morning.
- God...

457
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:14,579
Come on.

458
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,553
You used to love this shit.

459
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:18,385
You just let yourself get old.

460
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:20,948
I just let myself get bored.

461
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:26,254
This was fun.

462
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:29,061
We should do this again.

463
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:31,728
Yeah. Maybe.

464
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:33,395
Okay.

465
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:45,310
<i>Saturday is the one day</i>

466
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:47,215
<i>I like to sit in my house and relax.</i>

467
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:49,811
<i>Unfortunately,
it's also the same day</i>

468
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:52,948
<i>that Brenda likes to go
into Manhattan and shop.</i>

469
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,152
<i>Brenda didn't like
living in the city,</i>

470
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:57,821
<i>but she sure liked
buying her clothes there.</i>

471
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:03,157
Honey, why don't you get these?

472
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:04,167
I like them.

473
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:05,260
Oh, yeah.

474
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:06,736
Okay, well, let's
find your size

475
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:07,999
so that you can wear them.

476
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:10,473
Ah, come on, we drove
all the way to the city.

477
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,339
You could've got those
at the Panty Depot.

478
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:14,106
Oh, come on.
No, I like these.

479
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:15,840
- And they're comfortable, and they're cute.
- Richard?

480
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:17,575
Richard.

481
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:20,279
I thought you lived in Westchester.

482
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:22,183
- What are you doing here?
- Hey.

483
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:23,744
Nikki, Brenda.

484
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:25,153
Brenda, Nikki.

485
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,691
- Hi.
- Hi.

486
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,559
Nikki's an old friend.

487
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:31,926
Uh, what's it been,
like, seven, eight years?

488
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:33,294
At least.

489
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:36,425
Uh, Nikki used to date
Nelson, remember?

490
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:38,435
Yes. Yes!

491
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:39,663
Right.

492
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,729
And who is this handsome guy?

493
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:42,796
Oh, well, that's my Brian.

494
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:44,808
And that's Kelly.

495
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:45,900
Hi.

496
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:46,945
She's gorgeous.

497
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:48,001
Of course, like her mom.

498
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,069
Thank you.

499
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:50,045
Say, "thank you," Kelly.

500
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:51,673
Thank you.

501
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,308
These are great.

502
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:54,409
Where did you get these?

503
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:56,647
Is this the Heavenly Collection?

504
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:57,984
No, they're from
the Latifah Collection.

505
00:20:58,056 --> 00:20:59,250
Okay.

506
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:00,586
Stop.

507
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:02,422
Um, actually,
I don't know what they are.

508
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:03,483
But I got them downstairs.

509
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:05,723
Well, I should go pay for these.

510
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:08,957
Um, it was really nice to meet you.

511
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:10,228
Yes.

512
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:12,896
And it was great
seeing you, Richard.

513
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:15,303
Oh, great to see you.

514
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:16,432
Guys.

515
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:18,203
Bye-bye.

516
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,274
So she's the
one that, uh,

517
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:25,441
Nelson tried to kill himself over?

518
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:27,849
Yeah, he-he was going
through a lot back then.

519
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,648
Huh.

520
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:31,586
Yeah, guess he was.

521
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:39,663
I'm gonna take these back.

522
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:41,528
<i>Okay, that was a lie.</i>

523
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,295
<i>But big deal.</i>

524
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:44,767
<i>I mean, nothing happened.</i>

525
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:46,736
<i>Nikki's a friend.</i>

526
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,170
<i>An old friend.</i>

527
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,732
<i>I mean, I've known Nikki
longer than I've known Brenda.</i>

528
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,675
<i>She used to date Nelson.</i>

529
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:56,145
<i>We had a lot of fun together.</i>

530
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:58,808
<i>I mean, sh-she makes me laugh.</i>

531
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:01,512
<i>Th-There's nothing
wrong with that, right?</i>

532
00:22:01,586 --> 00:22:04,749
<i>Nikki's an old friend,
a good friend.</i>

533
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:07,724
<i>A friend I can't tell my wife about.</i>

534
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:08,725
Morning, Richard.

535
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:10,625
- Nikki called.
- Five minutes ago.

536
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:12,596
She said she'll be by at 6:00.

537
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,632
Is there something wrong?

538
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,632
No.

539
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:17,760
- Nothing.
- Nothing at all.

540
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:22,128
Wall sconces?

541
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:23,640
Well, they're not expensive

542
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:25,700
and we can get an electrician
to put them in.

543
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:27,574
What do you think of art deco?

544
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:29,238
Art deco's fine.

545
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:30,747
Hey.

546
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:31,976
Okay, if we go with art deco,

547
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,278
we might have to reupholster
the couch.

548
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,183
I thought we were
talking about wall sconces.

549
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:36,550
Well, they have to match, honey.

550
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:38,452
If they don't match,
then I got to change the rug.

551
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:40,081
- If I have to change the rug...
- I guess you're right.

552
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:42,786
Uh, honey, could we talk
about this later?

553
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:46,155
Yes. Look, I have to go-
it's parent-teacher night.

554
00:22:46,231 --> 00:22:48,324
I fixed you a plate, so just
heat it up when you get home.

555
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,164
Okay. So I'll-I'll
talk to you later.

556
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:56,235
Wall sconces.

557
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:58,105
Sounds fun.

558
00:22:58,176 --> 00:22:59,507
When exactly do you start

559
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:01,478
getting calls at work
about wall sconces?

560
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:02,808
Right after you get married.

561
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,849
I mean, before you get married,
you get calls like...

562
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:07,749
I can't wait to suck your dick.

563
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:10,947
Then, after you get married,
you get calls like...

564
00:23:11,022 --> 00:23:13,149
I can't wait for you
to come home

565
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,352
and see these drapes.

566
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:18,328
Poor Mr. Married Man.

567
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,388
I hope you don't mind me
stopping by like this,

568
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:22,160
but I bought something
for your kids.

569
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,202
I haven't been able to stop
thinking about you guys.

570
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:25,861
Hey, you didn't have
to get me anything.

571
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:26,869
I know.

572
00:23:26,938 --> 00:23:28,803
Thanks.

573
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:30,808
This stuff's expensive.

574
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:33,242
Oh, don't worry about it.

575
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:35,643
I put it on Teddy's credit card.

576
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:37,807
So now I owe Teddy some money.

577
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:42,885
So you're the expert-
what do you think?

578
00:23:42,954 --> 00:23:44,819
Would I make a good wife?

579
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,482
Nikki, you don't want to be a wife.

580
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:47,490
Why?

581
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:48,548
You want a wedding.

582
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:49,992
You want the show.

583
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:51,961
Mm-hmm.

584
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,657
What are you looking at?

585
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:55,723
You have any singles?

586
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:57,166
Yeah, I should have
about seven, eight bucks.

587
00:23:57,235 --> 00:23:58,167
What do you need?

588
00:23:58,236 --> 00:23:59,828
Just give me all of it.

589
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:03,341
All right, I'm gonna have
to break into my stripper stash.

590
00:24:08,246 --> 00:24:09,474
What are you doing?

591
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:11,448
Feeding the fish.

592
00:24:11,516 --> 00:24:13,643
Come here.

593
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:15,208
Look.

594
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:19,085
Okay, who is gonna get it?

595
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:20,146
Oh, look at this guy.

596
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:23,251
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

597
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:24,260
Whoo...!

598
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:25,421
Shh!

599
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:28,160
It's just a dollar.

600
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:29,325
It's just a buck.

601
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:31,062
- This is decadent.
- Try it.

602
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,398
All right.
All right, here we go.

603
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,871
Whoo!

604
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:35,929
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

605
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:36,996
Yeah!

606
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:38,702
You're going to cause a riot.

607
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:40,005
Well done!

608
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:44,438
Yes!

609
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:45,915
Oh, wow!

610
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:49,145
Ooh, look at the homeless guy.

611
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:50,882
Oh, get the mon...
Oh, he needs it.

612
00:24:50,956 --> 00:24:52,116
Never gonna get it.

613
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,179
Nope. Going too slow.

614
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:54,657
Come on, homeless guy.
You need that money.

615
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:57,722
Get it.

616
00:24:57,796 --> 00:24:59,354
- Nope.
- Oh!

617
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:01,422
White man wins again.

618
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:18,740
<i>That was fun.</i>

619
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:21,217
<i>That was too much fun.</i>

620
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:22,548
<i>You know what?</i>

621
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:24,816
<i>I better take my wife
out to dinner</i>

622
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:27,916
<i>and get the stench of fun
with another woman off of me.</i>

623
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:31,491
<i>I don't even want to go that way,:
you can't go down the FDR.</i>

624
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:32,825
Oh, God, no.
- It's insane.

625
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:34,889
<i>Okay, this is safe.</i>

626
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:36,763
<i>Dinner with Allan and Jennifer.</i>

627
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:37,995
<i>Once you get married,</i>

628
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:39,764
<i>you only hang out
with other married people.</i>

629
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:41,135
<i>Why?</i>

630
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:44,437
<i>'Cause no single person
could stand to be around you.</i>

631
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:46,477
<i>It wasn't always like this.</i>

632
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:50,311
<i>We all used to talk
about sex, politics, art.</i>

633
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,543
<i>But now, all we ever
talk about is our kids.</i>

634
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:54,175
Of course, I had
to miss the end,

635
00:25:54,252 --> 00:25:56,550
because I had a little
exploding diaper problem.

636
00:25:56,621 --> 00:25:58,179
<i>And when it's not our kids,</i>

637
00:25:58,256 --> 00:26:00,224
<i>it's always the same conversation.</i>

638
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:01,919
<i>First, there's the rap conversation.</i>

639
00:26:01,993 --> 00:26:03,984
...hos, hos, hos
in different area codes.

640
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:06,758
I'm kind of wondering,
did anybody have a nice mama?

641
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:08,093
Was it a situation
where their mama

642
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:09,098
smacked them
upside their head,

643
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:10,464
and they said, "Bitch!"

644
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:12,162
<i>Then there's the conversation
about theJews.</i>

645
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,761
They had it just as bad as us.

646
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:14,930
Black folks need
to take care of themselves

647
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:16,496
just as well as theJews
take care of themselves.

648
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,133
Except we can't stick together-
that's the problem.

649
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:21,303
We're too busy buying
spinning rims and gold teeth.

650
00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:23,370
You think Steven Spielberg
got spinning rims?

651
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:26,110
<i>And no group of people
are too sophisticated to have</i>

652
00:26:26,184 --> 00:26:27,651
<i>a conversation
about Michael Jackson.</i>

653
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:28,879
I blameJoe.

654
00:26:28,954 --> 00:26:30,478
Please, what grown-ass man

655
00:26:30,555 --> 00:26:32,216
sleeps in a bed with kids?

656
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:34,383
MichaelJackson
just didn't have a childhood.

657
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:37,053
Hey, man, childhood's only
12, 15 years.

658
00:26:37,128 --> 00:26:38,459
Michael's, like, 50.

659
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:41,465
How many sliding boards
does this nigga need?

660
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:43,660
You know good and well you would not
let that man babysit your kids.

661
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:46,727
I wouldn't let MichaelJackson
watch my kids on TV.

662
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:48,466
Amen.

663
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,167
Maybe he thought
the little boy was 18.

664
00:26:50,241 --> 00:26:51,674
You can't confuse the little boy.

665
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:53,142
Give me a break.

666
00:26:53,211 --> 00:26:54,269
Just yesterday, little Sharon

667
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:55,643
came into the room
singing "Magic Stick. "

668
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:57,545
I said, "Magic Stick"? Little
girl, you're four years old.

669
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:59,243
What do you know
about a magic stick?"

670
00:26:59,317 --> 00:27:01,148
Can I take your drink orders?

671
00:27:01,219 --> 00:27:02,516
Honey?

672
00:27:02,587 --> 00:27:04,248
Uh, you know what?
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

673
00:27:04,322 --> 00:27:05,584
Honey, can you just
get me some water?

674
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:06,817
Think I'll take a ginger ale.

675
00:27:06,891 --> 00:27:07,823
I'll have a Chardonnay.

676
00:27:07,892 --> 00:27:09,450
Okay.

677
00:27:09,527 --> 00:27:11,586
Excuse me, can I talk
to you for a second?

678
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:13,221
Is there a problem, sir?

679
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,731
Yes, there's a problem.

680
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,131
See, I came here
for a lovely dinner

681
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:18,567
with my wife
and some friends,

682
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:20,468
and next thing I know
is I got these big tits

683
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:22,199
asking me if I want a drink.

684
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:24,468
Do you mean your waitperson?

685
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:26,737
Listen, man, I'm with my wife.

686
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,278
I don't need this shit.

687
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:31,747
I don't need some girl, with
her big-ass village feeders,

688
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,545
asking me if I need some help.

689
00:27:33,618 --> 00:27:34,812
Is this Hooters?

690
00:27:34,886 --> 00:27:35,818
No, sir.

691
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:37,218
- Is it Hooters?
- No, sir.

692
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:38,812
I know this ain't Hooters,
'cause-'cause if it is,

693
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:41,154
you owe me some
fucking buffalo wings.

694
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:44,127
Sir, what can I do to make this better?

695
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:49,032
See that guy right there?

696
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,658
Yes, I do.

697
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:53,363
That's my waiter.

698
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:55,733
Thank you, sir.

699
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:57,638
Thank you.

700
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:20,224
What are you doing here?

701
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:21,788
You okay?

702
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:24,334
So he just got up
and said, "It's over"?

703
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:25,733
No, you don't understand.

704
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:28,671
If we're fucking and I
fall asleep, that's fine.

705
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,298
If we're fucking
and we both fall asleep,

706
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,002
that's okay, too,
but if we're fucking

707
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:34,875
and you fall asleep,
it's-it's fucked up!

708
00:28:34,946 --> 00:28:37,744
He didn't say it's over,
but I know it's over.

709
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:40,546
You-you got to excuse her;
she's upset.

710
00:28:40,618 --> 00:28:42,609
The fuck are you looking at?!

711
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:48,584
Our stop's coming up.

712
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:52,923
<i>When Nikki came by to see me in the afternoon,</i>

713
00:28:52,997 --> 00:28:55,830
<i>it wasn't really a big deal.</i>

714
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:59,336
<i>But when we walked through
the office at 9:00 a. m...</i>

715
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:00,530
Good morning.

716
00:29:00,605 --> 00:29:03,972
<i>...people looked at me
like I was crazy.</i>

717
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:06,272
<i>I mean crazy.</i>

718
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:10,978
It's like we've been
breaking up for months,

719
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:13,040
and I'm just finding out
about it now.

720
00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:14,176
Well, that's how relationships are.

721
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:17,153
You add how long
you been together,

722
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:18,689
and then you divide it by two,

723
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,384
and that's how long
you been breaking up.

724
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:22,983
So if you get a divorce
after 20 years,

725
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:24,790
you been breaking up for ten.

726
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:26,854
That's right.

727
00:29:30,668 --> 00:29:33,364
So can I stay with you
for a couple days?

728
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,566
Nikki, my wife...

729
00:29:40,578 --> 00:29:42,205
Oh...

730
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,373
I'm just playing with you.

731
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:48,551
You should see the look
on your face right now.

732
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:54,047
Okay, I'm not trying to get rid
of you, Nikki, but I really...

733
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,252
iPod.

734
00:29:57,829 --> 00:29:59,558
You got some nigga ears.

735
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,189
Nigga what?

736
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:03,063
Some old-ass nigga ears.

737
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:05,762
Look at this, Levert, Patti
LaBelle, Luther Vandross.

738
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:07,464
You know, white people
make music, too.

739
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:08,471
I got George Michael.

740
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,564
Doesn't count.

741
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:12,667
Okay, I'm gonna
give you my iPod,

742
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:14,735
and you are gonna give me yours.

743
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:15,780
Okay.

744
00:30:15,847 --> 00:30:18,008
When you get a chance,

745
00:30:18,082 --> 00:30:22,041
I want you to listen to that song.

746
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,088
Can I get back to work now?

747
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:27,714
# Fuck the cracker,
that's what I say #

748
00:31:27,785 --> 00:31:29,980
#And fuck these bitches
that always want to play #

749
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:32,318
# I'm the type of nigga
that's never gay #

750
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,824
# If you fuck with me, I'll
put your head in cake... #

751
00:31:54,178 --> 00:31:57,477
I think he might be off the phone.

752
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:10,284
Richard.

753
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:11,385
That girl is here to see you.

754
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:12,724
Well,just send her in.

755
00:32:12,797 --> 00:32:13,786
Richard...

756
00:32:14,832 --> 00:32:17,357
...can I ask you something?

757
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:19,494
Hi.

758
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:21,003
It can wait.

759
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:26,338
I don't think your
secretaries like me.

760
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:27,776
Hey, they don't like me, either.

761
00:32:27,845 --> 00:32:29,836
You know, if you keep
showing up like this,

762
00:32:29,914 --> 00:32:31,438
we're gonna have
to get you a job here.

763
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:32,676
People are gonna start talking.

764
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,718
Oh, let them talk.

765
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,378
I need you to do me a favor.

766
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,649
Can you come uptown with
me to look at a place?

767
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:40,657
You know, I-I got
a lot of work to do.

768
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:42,022
I got to get
out ofTeddy's,

769
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:45,460
and... he's supposed
to be out of town.

770
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,828
I'd like to be out by
the time he gets back.

771
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:50,823
Are you okay?

772
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:54,099
Can you come with me?

773
00:32:54,172 --> 00:32:55,662
Yeah, yeah.

774
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,367
- Let me just check.
- Okay.

775
00:32:57,442 --> 00:33:01,003
Tracy, what's my rest
of the day look like?

776
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:03,206
You and George have a
conference call at 3:00.

777
00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:04,509
Damn. George!

778
00:33:04,582 --> 00:33:05,549
Yeah?

779
00:33:05,616 --> 00:33:07,413
You need me for that call at 3:00?

780
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,248
I do. Why?

781
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,548
I got to do something.

782
00:33:10,621 --> 00:33:12,782
I mean, I-I should be back,
but if I'm not,

783
00:33:12,857 --> 00:33:14,017
you can handle it, right?

784
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:16,253
Yeah, I got it, don't worry.

785
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:17,760
Hi, I'm George.

786
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,262
- Nikki.
- Nice to meet you.

787
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,025
Likewise.

788
00:33:22,066 --> 00:33:23,693
So, I'll see you later?

789
00:33:23,768 --> 00:33:25,599
You tell me.

790
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:34,039
<i>You sure this is what you want?</i>

791
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:36,273
<i>It's what I can afford.</i>

792
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:38,178
So, where do you work?

793
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:41,150
I'm a hostess at a place downtown
called The White Bar.

794
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:44,620
Oh, that's nice.

795
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,089
Well, here you go.

796
00:33:47,158 --> 00:33:50,184
Washer and dryer
on the third floor,

797
00:33:50,261 --> 00:33:51,558
pay phone on the second floor.

798
00:33:51,629 --> 00:33:53,324
Don't knock on my door for change.

799
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:54,990
Get your own damn quarters.

800
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:57,660
Um, there was something
in the ad about cable.

801
00:33:57,735 --> 00:33:59,896
I got jumper cables,
if you need 'em.

802
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:00,995
Okay.

803
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:02,471
And don't blame me
if the bed's

804
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,973
not big enough for both of you.

805
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,509
This place is really for students.

806
00:34:05,576 --> 00:34:07,066
Oh, we are not a couple.

807
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:08,578
Yeah, yeah, I-I'm just a friend.

808
00:34:08,646 --> 00:34:09,738
Oh.

809
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:12,180
I guess that's a Super Bowl
ring, huh?

810
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,774
You a Jet or a Packer?

811
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:15,614
Uh-huh.

812
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:17,483
Which one of you friends
is paying the rent?

813
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:18,920
I am.

814
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:21,288
Sure you are, baby.

815
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,759
I never thought I'd be
back in one of these.

816
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:26,126
This is where everybody ends up.

817
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:33,965
<i>WOMAN... a wooden Barton hutch
made of pine in Al's backyard.</i>

818
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:37,599
This is a project an experienced
do-it-yourselfer could tackle,

819
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:42,135
since this shed is pre-cut
and ready to assemble.

820
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:44,113
- Hey, fellas.
Hi!

821
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:45,911
- How are you guys?
- Very well, thanks.

822
00:34:45,983 --> 00:34:48,952
That doesn't look so hard;
we can do that out back.

823
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:51,818
I'm getting splinters
just watching this.

824
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:59,263
I got to hand it to you-
you knocked it out the park.

825
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:01,821
It looks like EuroTech
may come aboard.

826
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:04,299
Hey, it's not a done deal,
and when it gets done,

827
00:35:04,368 --> 00:35:06,131
I couldn't have done it without you.

828
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:08,468
What do you say we go grab
some lunch and celebrate?

829
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:11,406
I- I'd love to... but
I got other plans.

830
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:13,273
Hey, guys. You ready?

831
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:15,574
Can I talk to you for a second?

832
00:35:15,646 --> 00:35:16,874
Yeah, sure.

833
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,313
Inside.

834
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:19,644
- Be right back.
- Okay.

835
00:35:19,717 --> 00:35:21,241
I'm sorry. I won't keep him long.

836
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:23,014
No problem.

837
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:29,660
Okay, what is it?

838
00:35:29,727 --> 00:35:32,560
Are you aware of what
you're getting yourself into?

839
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,619
What are you talking about?

840
00:35:33,698 --> 00:35:35,632
Nikki- she's here every day.

841
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,827
George, she's just a friend.

842
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:39,369
A friend? Come on.

843
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:42,270
I've had friends before- they
don't fucking look like Nikki.

844
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:45,070
Look, you got a good situation
at home, you got two kids...

845
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,838
I'm not fucking her.

846
00:35:46,911 --> 00:35:48,776
No, she's fucking you;
you just don't know it.

847
00:35:48,846 --> 00:35:52,543
I can't believe I'm hearing this shit from you,

848
00:35:52,617 --> 00:35:54,084
of all people.

849
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,382
You cheat on your wife all the time.

850
00:35:56,454 --> 00:35:58,547
Last year, you were
fucking Tracy and Mary.

851
00:35:58,623 --> 00:35:59,885
I didn't say shit to you.

852
00:35:59,957 --> 00:36:01,481
That's different.

853
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:02,924
I don't give a fuck.

854
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,621
I can fuck a girl, go home,

855
00:36:04,695 --> 00:36:07,027
kiss my wife good night
and sleep like a baby.

856
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:09,794
You, on the other hand,
got emotions.

857
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:12,836
You're like Captain
Save-A-Ho, all right?

858
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:15,464
You like to be needed,
and that bitch knows it.

859
00:36:17,074 --> 00:36:18,439
Are we done?

860
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,739
I'm not getting
in your shit, all right?

861
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:23,041
I just...

862
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:25,082
Be careful, okay?

863
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:32,383
Hey.

864
00:36:32,456 --> 00:36:33,616
What's wrong?

865
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,352
You look upset.

866
00:36:35,426 --> 00:36:37,394
We can't do this anymore.

867
00:36:37,461 --> 00:36:38,723
Do what?
What are you talking about?

868
00:36:38,796 --> 00:36:41,765
This whole... lunch in
the afternoon thing.

869
00:36:41,832 --> 00:36:44,027
It doesn't look good;
we really should stop.

870
00:36:44,101 --> 00:36:45,193
We're not doing anything.

871
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:46,327
It's not like we're fucking.

872
00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:47,632
It is like
we're fucking,

873
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:49,502
only thing, we're
not fucking,

874
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:51,804
and I feel all the guilt
as if I'm fucking you

875
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:54,242
without any of the pleasure
of actually fucking you.

876
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:56,337
I don't want things to
get any more complicated.

877
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:58,882
I'm not trying
to complicate anything.

878
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:01,248
I like you, Richard.

879
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:04,015
I don't like a lot of people.

880
00:37:04,088 --> 00:37:06,989
I like you 'cause you're safe.

881
00:37:08,092 --> 00:37:10,322
You don't want anything from me.

882
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:12,419
Okay?

883
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:15,325
Okay.

884
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:18,357
So, you want to get
something to eat?

885
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:19,733
No.

886
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:21,965
I have something else planned.

887
00:37:47,398 --> 00:37:49,628
Wow.

888
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,827
I've been thinking
about coming here.

889
00:37:51,902 --> 00:37:52,960
I knew you'd like it.

890
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:57,373
You should have one of these.

891
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:59,739
Wanted one of these
since I was a kid.

892
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:01,778
That I don't know.

893
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:03,643
What I know is that
I'm gonna get me

894
00:38:03,714 --> 00:38:05,079
a little Porsche one day.

895
00:38:05,149 --> 00:38:08,118
You're going down!
You're going down!

896
00:38:08,185 --> 00:38:09,277
I'm going down, all right.

897
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:16,284
- Oh!
- Yeah, yeah.

898
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,590
You dirty, dirty...!

899
00:38:38,582 --> 00:38:40,049
What is that?!

900
00:38:40,117 --> 00:38:41,277
Richard!

901
00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:43,343
Richard, Brian's asleep ups...!

902
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:49,258
What is that?

903
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:50,658
You-You don't like it?

904
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:51,660
No, no, I don't.

905
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:52,753
And you're making the kids deaf.

906
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,127
Ah, come on, it's not that loud.

907
00:38:54,198 --> 00:38:55,222
Yes, it is.

908
00:38:55,299 --> 00:38:56,266
And you know what?

909
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,359
I was in my car
the other day, and...

910
00:38:58,436 --> 00:39:00,131
Where did my CDs go?

911
00:39:00,204 --> 00:39:02,195
Wh-Where's my,
where's my Peabo Bryson?

912
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:03,934
Where's my Usher?
Where's my Beyonc?

913
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:06,067
You know, you really got some nigga ears, honey.

914
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,648
Nigga ears?

915
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:13,206
How many times do I
have to ask you

916
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:15,081
not to talk in front
of the kids like that?

917
00:39:15,152 --> 00:39:16,380
You know what?

918
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:17,546
You just keep doing
what you're doing.

919
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:18,645
'Cause one of these days,

920
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:20,623
they won't be asking
where my daddy is,

921
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:22,352
they'll be asking,
"Where's my nigga?"

922
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:26,894
Then what are you gonna do?

923
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:30,863
You know, I tried
calling you yesterday,

924
00:39:30,935 --> 00:39:32,129
and no one could find you.

925
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:35,639
Was probably at lunch.

926
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:37,037
No, it was almost 4:00.

927
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:38,200
Aren't you usually back by then?

928
00:39:38,275 --> 00:39:39,970
I mean, I tried
calling you on your cell,

929
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,978
I tried texting you,
you didn't text me back.

930
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,104
What did you want?

931
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,169
What difference
does it make

932
00:39:44,248 --> 00:39:45,215
what I wanted?

933
00:39:45,282 --> 00:39:46,647
That was yesterday.

934
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,912
You have to tell people
where you are.

935
00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:50,385
What if something
happened to the kids?

936
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:51,921
What if I got hit by a car?

937
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:53,616
Ah, come on, why do you always
have to take it to,

938
00:39:53,691 --> 00:39:55,488
"What if I got hit by a car?"

939
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:57,117
I- I went to the deli,

940
00:39:57,194 --> 00:39:58,354
I wanted a chicken salad sandwich.

941
00:39:58,429 --> 00:39:59,589
I- I stood on line.

942
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:01,255
Uh, when I got to
the front of the line,

943
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:02,492
I realized I didn't
have a ticket,

944
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:04,193
so I had to get back on the line.

945
00:40:04,268 --> 00:40:05,792
That's it.

946
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:07,861
You make it sound like an alibi.

947
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:09,496
All you have to do
is answer the phone.

948
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:12,133
I didn't hear it.

949
00:40:12,209 --> 00:40:14,609
All right.

950
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:18,479
Tomorrow.

951
00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:20,642
Have you thought
about what you want to do?

952
00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:22,345
Do you want to see a movie?

953
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,820
Do you want to have brunch
with Jennifer and Allan?

954
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:27,187
Nah, nah, nah, we do
that all the time.

955
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:28,816
Let's try something different.

956
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:31,555
Different?

957
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:32,596
Okay.

958
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:54,714
Honey, let's go look
at the new Porsches.

959
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:56,582
Wh... Why?

960
00:40:56,654 --> 00:40:57,814
No. No, no, no, no.

961
00:40:57,888 --> 00:40:59,549
In here, it says that
there's something over there

962
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:01,648
that you're really gonna like.

963
00:41:01,725 --> 00:41:03,215
Oh, yeah. Come on.

964
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,261
Let's go.

965
00:41:04,328 --> 00:41:05,955
Bye-bye.

966
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:07,725
Come on, baby.

967
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:34,116
<i>Going to the car show
and looking at the minivans</i>

968
00:41:34,191 --> 00:41:37,888
<i>was like going to a strip club
and looking at the DJ.</i>

969
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:41,759

00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:43,629
what sectors have the most

971
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:45,669
growth potential for our company?

972
00:41:45,736 --> 00:41:47,465
Well, Mr. Yuni, what
we're finding now

973
00:41:47,538 --> 00:41:50,598
is that most advertising dollars
are migrating online.

974
00:41:53,744 --> 00:41:55,473
Is that you?

975
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:59,179
It's me.

976
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:00,649
- I probably should, uh...
- Mm-hmm.

977
00:42:00,718 --> 00:42:03,050
Richard, I have an emergency.

978
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,553
I need to ask you something,

979
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:06,385
but I'm afraid
you're gonna get mad at me.

980
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:08,288
I have to take this.

981
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:09,621
Um, if you'll
excuse me,

982
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:11,354
I'll be, I'll be right back.

983
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:20,534
H- Hey, what's up?

984
00:42:20,604 --> 00:42:22,401
I can't really talk right now;
I'm in a meeting.

985
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:23,599
Okay, really quick.

986
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:25,073
Just promise you won't
get mad at me.

987
00:42:25,142 --> 00:42:27,167
I won't get mad.

988
00:42:27,244 --> 00:42:28,643
You didn't promise.

989
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:31,806
Okay, I promise.

990
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:34,817
Will you come with me to get my
stuff out ofTeddy's apartment?

991
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:36,853
Didn't you hear me tell you
I'm in a meeting?

992
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:37,910
Not today,

993
00:42:37,988 --> 00:42:39,148
tomorrow.

994
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:40,383
Fine.

995
00:42:40,457 --> 00:42:41,924
Okay? I got to go now.

996
00:42:41,992 --> 00:42:43,016
Have a good meeting.

997
00:42:44,161 --> 00:42:46,857
Oh, and what were your plans?

998
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:48,023
Three kids?

999
00:42:48,098 --> 00:42:49,326
Yeah, could be better.

1000
00:42:51,335 --> 00:42:53,200
Small family emergency.

1001
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:55,295
It's under control.

1002
00:43:00,344 --> 00:43:02,209
<i>All right, so where's this guy live?</i>

1003
00:43:02,279 --> 00:43:04,076
'Cause I got things to do.

1004
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:06,616
Shuttle's in, like, 45 minutes.

1005
00:43:06,684 --> 00:43:07,981
Shuttle?

1006
00:43:08,052 --> 00:43:10,543
Wh-What are you
talking about, shuttle?

1007
00:43:10,621 --> 00:43:11,713
To D.C.

1008
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:13,586
Remember I told you,
we have a place there,

1009
00:43:13,657 --> 00:43:16,626
and he's out of town, so
now I can get my shit.

1010
00:43:16,694 --> 00:43:19,322
I'm not going with you to D.C.

1011
00:43:19,396 --> 00:43:21,057
You promised.

1012
00:43:21,131 --> 00:43:23,463
I didn't promise to go
with you to another state.

1013
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:25,934
It's not a state, it's a district.

1014
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:28,301
It's, like, a 30-minute flight.

1015
00:43:28,372 --> 00:43:30,704
You must be
out of your fucking mind

1016
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:34,107
if you think I'm getting
on a plane to Washington D.C.

1017
00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:36,874
to go to some guy's house
to get your shit!

1018
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:47,488
Richard?

1019
00:43:47,558 --> 00:43:48,855
Richard, yeah.

1020
00:43:48,926 --> 00:43:51,087
Uh, I have one question for you:

1021
00:43:51,161 --> 00:43:52,219
Where the fuck are you?

1022
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:53,558
No, no, no, don't worry.

1023
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:54,689
I'll be there.

1024
00:43:54,765 --> 00:43:56,596
Yeah, something just came up.

1025
00:43:56,667 --> 00:43:57,895
Look,just get here, okay?

1026
00:43:57,968 --> 00:43:59,401
I told you I need you on this one.

1027
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:01,563
Tell Mary that
if Nikki calls,

1028
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:02,697
I'll call her tomorrow.

1029
00:44:02,773 --> 00:44:05,537
Tell her yourself when you get here.

1030
00:44:05,609 --> 00:44:08,203
You're a good liar.

1031
00:44:08,278 --> 00:44:10,576
Listen, we're getting
on the 1:00 shuttle,

1032
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:11,672
not a moment later, okay?

1033
00:44:11,749 --> 00:44:13,307
'Cause I got a meeting at 3:00.

1034
00:44:13,384 --> 00:44:15,079
Okay.

1035
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:30,964
Right here.

1036
00:44:31,035 --> 00:44:32,059
- Here?
- Uh-huh.

1037
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:33,660
What are all these cops doing here?

1038
00:44:33,737 --> 00:44:35,728
Oh, it's kind of
a crazy neighborhood.

1039
00:44:35,806 --> 00:44:37,103
Something's always going down.

1040
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:38,869
- We'll be right back.
- Okay.

1041
00:44:44,481 --> 00:44:46,073
So how many cities
have you lived in

1042
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:48,084
- with this Teddy guy?
- Hey, police! Open up in there!

1043
00:44:48,152 --> 00:44:50,882
- Uh, here, and New York.
- Open up in there!

1044
00:44:50,954 --> 00:44:52,353
In Miami, I lived with his brother.

1045
00:44:52,423 --> 00:44:53,390
That's where I met him.

1046
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:54,754
Wait a minute,
you lived with a guy,

1047
00:44:54,825 --> 00:44:57,225
then you left him for his brother?

1048
00:44:57,294 --> 00:44:58,352
How'd you pull that off?

1049
00:44:58,429 --> 00:44:59,555
I got a hard enough time

1050
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:01,723
telling my wife I want pancakes.

1051
00:45:01,799 --> 00:45:02,891
We're in.

1052
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:13,233
All right,
now that we're in,

1053
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:14,800
I want you to
get your shit

1054
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:16,402
and let's get out of here.

1055
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,880
I'm just gonna grab
a few dresses, some shoes,

1056
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:19,881
and then we'll go.

1057
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:21,247
Okay.

1058
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:22,444
Thank you.

1059
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:24,578
Forget "Thank you,"just hurry up.

1060
00:45:29,026 --> 00:45:30,459
Teddy's doing pretty good.

1061
00:45:30,527 --> 00:45:31,459
Mm-hmm.

1062
00:45:41,472 --> 00:45:44,032
You were on the math team
in high school?

1063
00:45:44,108 --> 00:45:46,167
For two years. Why?

1064
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:47,335
I don't know.

1065
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:50,005
Just can't imagine you
solving a problem.

1066
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,878
My Ferretti sweater.

1067
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:55,783
I had no idea where this was.

1068
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:04,325
Richard Cooper's office.

1069
00:46:04,394 --> 00:46:05,486
Hi, Brenda.

1070
00:46:07,397 --> 00:46:08,557
Hey, somebody
around here's

1071
00:46:08,632 --> 00:46:10,566
got some nigga ears.

1072
00:46:10,634 --> 00:46:13,398
Excuse me?

1073
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:15,028
<i>Biz Markie's Greatest Hits.</i>

1074
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:17,835
That man is a genius.

1075
00:46:17,908 --> 00:46:20,240
The genius that wrote
"Pickin' Boogers. "

1076
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:22,505
"Pickin' Boogers," "The Vapors"

1077

#You got what I need #

# But you say he's just a friend #

1081
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:33,950
# But you say
he's just a friend #

1082
00:46:34,024 --> 00:46:35,889
# Oh, baby, you #

1083
00:46:36,994 --> 00:46:39,155
#You got what I need. #

1084
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:44,825
Okay, Teddy, calm down.

1085
00:46:44,902 --> 00:46:46,335
You know you got two strikes.

1086
00:46:46,403 --> 00:46:47,700
There's cops all over the place.

1087
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:50,500
How the fuck y'all get in here, man?

1088
00:46:50,574 --> 00:46:51,506
Huh?

1089
00:46:51,575 --> 00:46:53,008
Who the fuck are you?

1090
00:46:53,076 --> 00:46:55,340
Huh?

1091
00:46:55,412 --> 00:46:57,346
What, this the new nigga?

1092
00:46:57,414 --> 00:46:59,382
You fucking him now? Huh?

1093
00:46:59,449 --> 00:47:01,246
You the new nigga, man?

1094
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:03,809
No, no, I'm-I'm not the new nigga.

1095
00:47:03,887 --> 00:47:06,219
I've n-never been the nigga,
I'm just a... friend.

1096
00:47:07,624 --> 00:47:09,114
How's it going?
Richard Cooper.

1097
00:47:09,593 --> 00:47:10,525
Oh!

- Teddy!
- Motherfucker!

1099
00:47:11,895 --> 00:47:13,226
Teddy, what the fuck's
wrong with you?!

1100
00:47:13,297 --> 00:47:15,356
- You bring this stupid-ass nigga
- Stop it!

1101
00:47:15,432 --> 00:47:16,456

1102
00:47:16,533 --> 00:47:17,557
Help!

1103
00:47:17,634 --> 00:47:18,794
- Fuck you!
- Somebody help!

1104
00:47:18,869 --> 00:47:20,894
- Take the boot! Take the boot!
- Somebody help us!

1105
00:47:20,971 --> 00:47:21,938
Take the motherfucking boot!

1106
