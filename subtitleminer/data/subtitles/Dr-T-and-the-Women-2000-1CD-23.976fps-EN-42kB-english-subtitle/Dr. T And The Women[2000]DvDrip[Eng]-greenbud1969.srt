1
00:00:50,694 --> 00:00:51,862
So...

2
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:56,492
So, Dr. T, I hear
your wife's sister...

3
00:00:56,951 --> 00:01:00,204
...moved back in with you
a few days ago.

4
00:01:01,705 --> 00:01:04,583
- Is that true?
- Yes, it is.

5
00:01:05,167 --> 00:01:07,711
Peggy, and three kids.

6
00:01:09,338 --> 00:01:11,048
I'm sorry.

7
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,052
What is your wife's name?

8
00:01:15,386 --> 00:01:18,764
- Kate.
- Kate! Of course, Kate.

9
00:01:22,351 --> 00:01:26,313
And your wife's sister's name is...?

10
00:01:26,647 --> 00:01:30,025
- Peggy.
- Peggy! Peggy, yes, Peggy.

11
00:01:31,777 --> 00:01:36,282
So, how many children does Peggy
have now?

12
00:01:37,366 --> 00:01:38,784
She has three.

13
00:01:40,202 --> 00:01:42,538
- They have all girls.
- Three.

14
00:01:43,872 --> 00:01:45,249
All girls?

15
00:01:48,043 --> 00:01:49,461
That's nice.

16
00:01:49,795 --> 00:01:51,297
Yes, it is.

17
00:01:53,424 --> 00:01:55,384
Wouldn't have it any other way.

18
00:01:55,718 --> 00:01:57,344
Nor would I.

19
00:02:06,228 --> 00:02:08,606
Dr. Travis' office. May I help you?

20
00:02:10,441 --> 00:02:13,485
Oh, now, please tell me
that room's ready.

21
00:02:13,777 --> 00:02:16,113
Sweetie, everything okay in there?

22
00:02:17,615 --> 00:02:20,326
Didn't I tell you
you'd be in this room?

23
00:02:20,659 --> 00:02:22,494
You did. You're so good.

24
00:02:22,828 --> 00:02:24,455
Oh, I hope so.

25
00:02:26,498 --> 00:02:27,791
Marsha?

26
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:29,793
- Marsha?
- Yeah.

27
00:02:30,127 --> 00:02:33,213
Darling, insurance, new payments,
is that...?

28
00:02:33,505 --> 00:02:35,174
You've got an appointment?

29
00:02:35,466 --> 00:02:37,968
- Your name?
- Nina Shipman. From Corpus.

30
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:43,015
Joanne, you've got a new insurance,
did you know that?

31
00:02:44,224 --> 00:02:45,976
I thought that was for me.

32
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:49,897
I bet you do. Once for every store.
Plus an extra.

33
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,982
I might. I think I might.

34
00:03:04,453 --> 00:03:06,497
- Allison, sweetie.
- Yes?

35
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:09,500
Miss Shipman. First timer.

36
00:03:14,254 --> 00:03:17,007
Insurance information, the new one.

37
00:03:21,011 --> 00:03:22,262
Hey, everybody.

38
00:03:22,596 --> 00:03:24,765
Abbey, how are you?
You look beautiful.

39
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:28,811
Here's some brand new information
you've never heard in this office:

40
00:03:29,144 --> 00:03:32,648
We're running late.
Now how could that happen...

41
00:03:32,982 --> 00:03:34,525
...every day?

42
00:03:35,651 --> 00:03:38,904
- Hey, Liz. How you doing?
- Liz, how are you?

43
00:03:40,531 --> 00:03:44,118
Five minutes is about all we can do,
and that'll be a miracle.

44
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,170
I'll be back in a second.

45
00:03:57,589 --> 00:04:00,217
Hi, Mrs. Larson. How are you today?

46
00:04:00,551 --> 00:04:02,094
I'll take you over to Judy.

47
00:04:02,428 --> 00:04:07,266
We're gonna set up tests for you and
appointments for the next few weeks.

48
00:04:11,895 --> 00:04:14,064
Liz! Hi, how are you?

49
00:04:14,398 --> 00:04:15,941
You look a little pale.

50
00:04:16,275 --> 00:04:19,695
- Never been better.
- Don't forget my garden party.

51
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:22,197
Oh, yeah, yeah. I will. I will.

52
00:04:22,531 --> 00:04:25,409
Make sure. I will never
forgive you if you don't.

53
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,370
Hello, Judy.

54
00:04:28,704 --> 00:04:32,958
I've got a meeting with the mayor.
You won't make me wait, will you?

55
00:04:33,292 --> 00:04:36,920
You should call him and tell him
you need to see your ob-gyn.

56
00:04:37,254 --> 00:04:40,466
As usual in a doctor's office,
you'll have to wait.

57
00:04:40,799 --> 00:04:44,386
I know you shouldn't have to, but our
doctor doesn't understand that.

58
00:04:44,678 --> 00:04:47,431
But I've already done my breast exam.

59
00:04:47,765 --> 00:04:51,268
Great, we should give you extra
points for that. Or a deduction.

60
00:04:51,602 --> 00:04:53,604
- You're in my seat.
- I'm sorry.

61
00:04:53,938 --> 00:04:56,523
Give me just a few more minutes.

62
00:04:56,857 --> 00:04:59,193
- How much time?
- I don't know, 30.

63
00:05:04,782 --> 00:05:07,993
- That bathroom is disgusting.
- The bathroom?

64
00:05:08,327 --> 00:05:09,828
Yes, it is.

65
00:05:13,123 --> 00:05:18,462
How many people are you "working in"?
Can the doctor say no to anybody?

66
00:05:47,032 --> 00:05:47,616
Pull!

67
00:05:48,784 --> 00:05:51,370
- I think I might've grazed that one.
- A definite...

68
00:05:52,037 --> 00:05:53,580
- Almost.
- Almost.

69
00:05:53,914 --> 00:05:55,874
You saw that spin to the right.

70
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:58,836
Yeah, that was a sure thing there.

71
00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:02,089
- Bernadette Rose is in.
- Hey, Sully.

72
00:06:02,423 --> 00:06:05,509
You and me, head to head,
five bucks a shot.

73
00:06:06,093 --> 00:06:09,263
Why don't you just give him
your ATM card and be done?

74
00:06:10,764 --> 00:06:12,182
Are you ready for this?

75
00:06:12,766 --> 00:06:14,059
We're ready.

76
00:06:18,606 --> 00:06:20,524
- Holy shit.
- Oh, man!

77
00:06:20,816 --> 00:06:21,567
Unbelievable.

78
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,193
How do you do that?

79
00:06:23,527 --> 00:06:24,695
Want my secret?

80
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,905
Bernadette Rose.

81
00:06:27,239 --> 00:06:29,116
Never take a good woman for granted.

82
00:06:29,867 --> 00:06:33,662
You and Sully had the perfect day.
You were the perfect couple.

83
00:06:33,954 --> 00:06:37,458
I was the little
geeky 8-year-old...

84
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:40,586
...just trying to be proper.

85
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:45,132
But it was so wonderful and that's
the way it should be.

86
00:06:45,591 --> 00:06:50,679
I want it to be the perfect wedding...
I was gonna say "of her life."

87
00:06:51,013 --> 00:06:55,142
The only wedding of her life,
that's the perfect wedding.

88
00:06:55,434 --> 00:06:58,270
Look at these.
This is what I was talking about.

89
00:06:58,604 --> 00:07:00,356
Your phone's ringing.

90
00:07:02,816 --> 00:07:06,779
Every time I hear it,
I assume it's somebody else's.

91
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:09,531
Excuse me.

92
00:07:10,157 --> 00:07:11,825
Oh, good grief.

93
00:07:13,035 --> 00:07:15,371
Hello? Hey, baby girl.

94
00:07:15,663 --> 00:07:19,583
Mommy, we're playing doctor and Amber
won't go tee-tee when I say...

95
00:07:19,917 --> 00:07:21,001
...and Maria won't help.

96
00:07:21,794 --> 00:07:23,629
Girl, you did not.

97
00:07:23,963 --> 00:07:26,590
If Amber doesn't want to go,
don't make her.

98
00:07:28,008 --> 00:07:30,052
Honey, that's Uncle Sully's.

99
00:07:30,552 --> 00:07:32,721
You do not tee-tee on those sticks.

100
00:07:33,055 --> 00:07:34,723
Give me... Let me talk to Maria.

101
00:07:35,057 --> 00:07:37,559
- Mommy, when are you coming home?
- Give me.

102
00:07:37,851 --> 00:07:39,061
Sorry, wrong number.

103
00:07:39,728 --> 00:07:41,772
May I be of some assistance?

104
00:07:42,106 --> 00:07:43,565
Thank you, not right now.

105
00:07:43,899 --> 00:07:47,111
If there's anything I can do,
my name is Tiffany.

106
00:07:47,444 --> 00:07:49,363
Your name's Tiffany?

107
00:07:49,655 --> 00:07:50,447
Tiffany!

108
00:07:50,781 --> 00:07:52,908
Kind of a coincidence, I know.

109
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:01,500
Dee Dee!

110
00:08:02,626 --> 00:08:06,505
You're late. We were supposed to meet
at the fountain at 2:00.

111
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:09,591
Where are you going?
Tiffany's is that way.

112
00:08:10,801 --> 00:08:12,511
You said the fountain at 2:00.

113
00:08:12,803 --> 00:08:14,888
No, I said Tiffany's at 2:15.

114
00:08:15,222 --> 00:08:16,890
I swear you said the fountain.

115
00:08:17,224 --> 00:08:19,602
We're here for
the bridal registration.

116
00:08:19,893 --> 00:08:21,687
Are you the bride?

117
00:08:22,021 --> 00:08:24,648
No. No. I am...

118
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:29,612
...getting a divorce probably myself.
But my niece is getting married.

119
00:08:29,945 --> 00:08:32,364
- Great!
- Kate, my sister, called.

120
00:08:32,698 --> 00:08:34,658
- What's her name?
- Mrs. Travis.

121
00:08:34,992 --> 00:08:36,076
Pull.

122
00:08:38,871 --> 00:08:39,872
- That was gorgeous.
- You hooked it.

123
00:08:40,205 --> 00:08:42,333
That was a draw, a beautiful draw.

124
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:45,669
I know a hook when I see a hook.

125
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:50,090
If we were quail hunting, Eli,
I'm afraid you'd be going hungry.

126
00:08:50,424 --> 00:08:53,594
Hungry! Oh, damn, I forgot.
I got sandwiches here.

127
00:08:53,886 --> 00:08:55,346
Break time.

128
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:59,141
- Pimiento cheese sandwiches.
- Grab that chair.

129
00:08:59,475 --> 00:09:02,394
Always a pleasure
to put the feedbag on at Sully's.

130
00:09:02,728 --> 00:09:04,772
- Alrighty.
- Dr. T's Roadhouse, huh?

131
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:06,982
They're not gonna be here.

132
00:09:07,316 --> 00:09:11,278
- I told them to meet us at Tiffany's.
- Look, they're not here.

133
00:09:11,612 --> 00:09:12,696
There's Mom.

134
00:09:17,117 --> 00:09:20,496
- Hi.
- Oh, it's you.

135
00:09:20,913 --> 00:09:23,040
- Hi, baby.
- Hi.

136
00:09:23,374 --> 00:09:24,166
How are you?

137
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,378
Here we are, champagne for everyone.

138
00:09:28,045 --> 00:09:30,506
- Hi, Ma.
- Hi, honey.

139
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:32,007
This is the bride.

140
00:09:32,341 --> 00:09:33,884
- Dee Dee Travis.
- Tiffany.

141
00:09:34,218 --> 00:09:36,053
- Oh, how cute.
- Here you go.

142
00:09:36,387 --> 00:09:39,265
- I don't drink.
- Shall we look at some flatware?

143
00:09:39,598 --> 00:09:42,393
Peggy, I love your hat.
It's beautiful.

144
00:09:42,726 --> 00:09:45,354
- Can I try it on?
- Of course you can.

145
00:09:45,688 --> 00:09:47,189
You look so good in hats.

146
00:09:47,481 --> 00:09:50,734
- How does it look?
- That looks so good on you.

147
00:09:51,068 --> 00:09:52,236
Doesn't it look great?

148
00:09:52,569 --> 00:09:54,530
Peggy has that same hat.

149
00:09:54,863 --> 00:09:56,156
This is Peggy's hat.

150
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:58,492
"Autobahn." That's funny.

151
00:09:58,826 --> 00:10:00,786
A little contemporary for you.

152
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,830
It's very delicate.

153
00:10:03,956 --> 00:10:06,292
What a beautiful ring. Is it ours?

154
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,377
No, it's Harry Winston's.

155
00:10:08,711 --> 00:10:12,673
I think she actually preferred
the Swag Collection.

156
00:10:13,007 --> 00:10:15,342
I don't like the Swag Collection.

157
00:10:15,634 --> 00:10:19,221
It makes a very opulent display,
doesn't it?

158
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,766
- What kind of pattern is this?
- This is chrysanthemum.

159
00:10:33,944 --> 00:10:36,739
- And a pimiento cheese sandwich.
- Something different.

160
00:10:37,072 --> 00:10:39,283
A pimiento cheese sandwich.

161
00:10:39,575 --> 00:10:40,993
Thirty-five dollars.

162
00:10:41,285 --> 00:10:44,121
- I'll have the pimiento cheese.
- I love the variety.

163
00:10:44,413 --> 00:10:48,834
I have never spent $35
on a pimiento cheese sandwich...

164
00:10:50,085 --> 00:10:53,714
...but it's good. It hits the spot.
Who made these, by the way?

165
00:10:55,049 --> 00:10:57,551
How is Kate? Haven't seen her lately.

166
00:10:57,843 --> 00:11:02,222
Yeah, she's... She's all involved
with Dee Dee's wedding.

167
00:11:02,556 --> 00:11:04,808
That's a full-time job:
Women and weddings.

168
00:11:05,142 --> 00:11:08,312
When I hear you, it makes
me glad I don't have a wife.

169
00:11:08,604 --> 00:11:11,315
When you get one, make sure
she's like Sully's.

170
00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:14,985
You're a lucky man, Sully.
Hang on to her.

171
00:11:16,612 --> 00:11:18,113
I'm trying.

172
00:11:27,665 --> 00:11:28,958
Mom?

173
00:11:32,169 --> 00:11:33,128
Have you seen Mom?

174
00:11:33,462 --> 00:11:35,839
- She was right here.
- Ma?

175
00:11:38,884 --> 00:11:40,761
She was right here.

176
00:11:41,095 --> 00:11:44,598
- Oh, miss. Miss?
- What?

177
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:46,308
The knife.

178
00:11:46,642 --> 00:11:48,394
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

179
00:11:52,481 --> 00:11:54,817
- There it is.
- Sorry, we're just leaving.

180
00:11:55,109 --> 00:11:57,361
Thank you so much for everything.

181
00:11:57,695 --> 00:12:01,907
That was sweet, and this is just
the best champagne. I love it!

182
00:12:02,241 --> 00:12:05,035
- A toast to you, Tiffany.
- Well, cheers.

183
00:12:05,577 --> 00:12:09,081
The namesake of the store.
Bless your sweet heart. Thank you.

184
00:12:09,415 --> 00:12:11,709
- Where's Peggy?
- God, there you are.

185
00:12:12,042 --> 00:12:14,628
Mom's gone and I gotta go. Okay?

186
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,590
Why did you let her come out?
You know how absent-minded Mom's been.

187
00:12:18,924 --> 00:12:20,467
She'll find her way home.

188
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:25,264
She woke up in the middle of the night
and pitched a tent in the backyard.

189
00:12:25,598 --> 00:12:29,476
- Girls, I think I'm gonna need a ride.
- I'll give you a ride.

190
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:32,271
She made pimiento cheese sandwiches
for breakfast.

191
00:12:32,605 --> 00:12:34,523
Daddy likes pimiento cheese.

192
00:12:34,857 --> 00:12:36,900
- Give me some air.
- Something's wrong.

193
00:12:37,234 --> 00:12:39,862
Where do you think Kate went, anyway?

194
00:13:05,596 --> 00:13:07,598
- Snuck up on us, didn't it?
- Let's go.

195
00:13:07,932 --> 00:13:10,309
It looks like it's gonna piss down.

196
00:13:10,601 --> 00:13:11,977
Come on, let's go.

197
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:13,771
Oh, shit.

198
00:13:15,898 --> 00:13:16,774
Get your gun.

199
00:13:17,107 --> 00:13:21,153
Oh, shit, my gun,
my gun, my gun.

200
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:25,324
- Get in the damn car.
- You're gonna get Lucille wet.

201
00:13:25,658 --> 00:13:28,077
That's all right.
I like my women wet.

202
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:30,704
Maybe that's why she can't hit a barn.

203
00:13:31,038 --> 00:13:33,707
You of all people got something
against wet women?

204
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:36,794
You know, certain Indian tribes say...

205
00:13:37,127 --> 00:13:40,798
...if a woman's all wet the first time
you see her it's bad luck.

206
00:13:41,131 --> 00:13:43,676
- You think that's true?
- It's pure horse shit.

207
00:13:43,968 --> 00:13:45,552
Oh, shit!

208
00:14:27,511 --> 00:14:32,099
Oh, my God!
Where'd that come from?

209
00:14:33,183 --> 00:14:34,768
Look at you.

210
00:14:35,936 --> 00:14:40,608
- Sorry I'm getting your carpet wet.
- It's just carpet. It'll dry.

211
00:14:40,941 --> 00:14:43,527
Yeah, it's raining.
Rain'll make you wet.

212
00:14:43,902 --> 00:14:45,613
Yes, it will.

213
00:14:45,988 --> 00:14:47,448
Is Harlan here?

214
00:14:47,781 --> 00:14:50,618
No, Harlan said he was gonna be
hunting all day.

215
00:14:51,118 --> 00:14:53,037
- Hunting?
- That's what he said.

216
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:55,664
- Can we help you?
- I'm Bree Davis.

217
00:14:55,998 --> 00:14:57,416
- I'm Randy.
- How are you?

218
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,044
You're the new golf pro chick.

219
00:15:00,377 --> 00:15:02,963
I'm the new assistant golf pro chick.

220
00:15:04,173 --> 00:15:06,925
Wow, Bree. That's one
interesting name.

221
00:15:07,259 --> 00:15:09,637
Is it Brie like the cheese or...

222
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:12,932
No. It's Bree like breed,
without the "d."

223
00:15:24,985 --> 00:15:27,529
This'll wake your soul right up.

224
00:15:31,575 --> 00:15:34,119
It's rain! It is raining!

225
00:15:34,453 --> 00:15:36,497
Be careful, there's puddles.

226
00:15:37,581 --> 00:15:39,541
You are so sweet to bring me back.

227
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:42,544
- It's okay, Peggy.
- I love this!

228
00:15:49,218 --> 00:15:50,678
Soaking wet!

229
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,972
Girls!

230
00:15:53,889 --> 00:15:55,557
Mommy's back!

231
00:15:55,849 --> 00:15:58,227
Wait till you see. Look at me.

232
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,730
We got caught in the rain, Maria.

233
00:16:02,064 --> 00:16:03,816
I'm gonna get you all wet.

234
00:16:04,984 --> 00:16:06,652
Oh, little fairies.

235
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:11,115
- Where's Mom?
- I thought she was with you.

236
00:16:11,448 --> 00:16:12,491
Has she called?

237
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:34,722
Is there someplace I can put this?

238
00:16:35,055 --> 00:16:38,726
Yeah, yeah. There's some cubbyholes
back there in the back.

239
00:16:39,059 --> 00:16:40,644
Throw it there, that'd be fine.

240
00:16:40,978 --> 00:16:42,688
- Who is that guy?
- That guy?

241
00:16:43,355 --> 00:16:46,191
That's Harvey Penick.
He's a famous golf guy.

242
00:16:46,525 --> 00:16:48,444
I know who he is. Who's that?

243
00:16:48,736 --> 00:16:52,573
Dr. Travis. He's one of our members.
He's been here a long time.

244
00:16:52,865 --> 00:16:54,533
What kind of doctor is he?

245
00:16:54,867 --> 00:16:56,577
He's the lucky kind.

246
00:17:13,469 --> 00:17:15,971
It is coming down, man!

247
00:17:19,391 --> 00:17:21,435
It's good to see you. How are you?

248
00:17:21,769 --> 00:17:23,812
- I'm getting you wet.
- That's okay.

249
00:17:24,146 --> 00:17:28,067
- I thought you were coming tomorrow.
- I was, but I just kept driving.

250
00:17:28,525 --> 00:17:32,738
Let me get out of these things. This
is Bree Davis, the new assistant pro.

251
00:17:33,072 --> 00:17:35,616
- How are you?
- I'm all wet, how you doing?

252
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:38,202
- I'm gonna change.
- Hi. I'm Bree.

253
00:17:38,535 --> 00:17:40,454
Sully Travis. Nice to meet you.

254
00:17:40,788 --> 00:17:41,956
Are you Dr. Travis?

255
00:17:42,581 --> 00:17:44,458
Yeah, or Dr. T.

256
00:17:45,042 --> 00:17:47,169
Most people just call me Dr. T.

257
00:17:47,503 --> 00:17:50,089
Well, it's very nice to meet you,
Dr. T.

258
00:17:50,422 --> 00:17:53,717
- You said your name was Bree?
- Not like the cheese.

259
00:17:54,009 --> 00:17:57,346
- B-R-E-E like breed or...
- Breech.

260
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,139
Without the "c-h."

261
00:17:59,515 --> 00:18:01,350
I never heard that, but sure.

262
00:18:02,059 --> 00:18:03,560
How'd you know I'm a doctor?

263
00:18:03,894 --> 00:18:08,899
I looked at your picture and thought
you looked familiar, so I asked.

264
00:18:21,787 --> 00:18:23,289
That is out of control!

265
00:18:47,855 --> 00:18:51,775
I met my first girlfriend
at a pool party when I was 16.

266
00:18:52,067 --> 00:18:53,402
Soaking wet, she was.

267
00:18:54,361 --> 00:18:57,489
And I swear, within a week
I started losing my hair.

268
00:18:57,781 --> 00:18:59,408
You guys are crazy.

269
00:18:59,908 --> 00:19:03,370
Superstition is for the unimaginative.

270
00:19:03,704 --> 00:19:06,832
My imagination knows a mare's nest
when it sees one.

271
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:09,668
- What's a mare's nest?
- Like a wolf in sheep's clothing.

272
00:19:10,294 --> 00:19:12,963
- Wet clothing, in her case.
- You know your problem?

273
00:19:13,255 --> 00:19:15,090
- Who, me?
- All of you.

274
00:19:15,424 --> 00:19:17,134
You don't understand women.

275
00:19:17,426 --> 00:19:20,304
Women are incapable of being bad luck
by themselves.

276
00:19:20,638 --> 00:19:22,556
It's men who make them that way.

277
00:19:23,098 --> 00:19:26,977
Women are, by nature, they are saints.

278
00:19:27,311 --> 00:19:29,813
They're sacred, and should be
treated as such.

279
00:19:30,731 --> 00:19:34,818
The lady, the new golf lady.
The cheese...

280
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:39,865
She's outside. She said she wants
to talk to you. It's important.

281
00:19:46,413 --> 00:19:48,332
Well, hello again, Bree.

282
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:51,168
I'm getting singles for liar's poker,
you want some?

283
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:54,046
- So what's up?
- Your wife called.

284
00:19:55,047 --> 00:19:56,966
Did she say what she wanted?

285
00:19:57,299 --> 00:20:00,719
It actually wasn't your wife.
It was the police.

286
00:20:01,053 --> 00:20:03,347
They need you to come down
to the station.

287
00:20:03,681 --> 00:20:05,516
They said downtown.

288
00:20:06,642 --> 00:20:08,227
Thanks. Thank you.

289
00:20:10,145 --> 00:20:13,107
Well, about my client, Kate Travis.

290
00:20:13,399 --> 00:20:16,193
Will she be in
in about half an hour?

291
00:20:16,527 --> 00:20:18,487
Can I make an appointment?

292
00:20:18,821 --> 00:20:21,156
All right. Thanks very much.

293
00:20:21,532 --> 00:20:24,493
Can you hurry that up?
Can we let my client out?

294
00:20:24,827 --> 00:20:26,829
You made me make a mistake.

295
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:31,792
Darling?

296
00:20:33,752 --> 00:20:35,337
Did something happen there?

297
00:20:35,921 --> 00:20:39,925
Is that why you did it? Why did you
take your clothes off in the mall?

298
00:20:43,846 --> 00:20:47,057
My sleeves got wet
and they got really, really long...

299
00:20:47,391 --> 00:20:49,435
...like a straitjacket.

300
00:20:52,521 --> 00:20:56,191
Did you go in the fountain?
You didn't even get wet.

301
00:21:03,324 --> 00:21:04,742
Hey, talk to me.

302
00:21:19,715 --> 00:21:21,759
- Hi.
- Hey.

303
00:21:24,595 --> 00:21:28,515
You think there's someplace
I could take a bath here?

304
00:21:36,023 --> 00:21:37,775
We'll do that when we get home.

305
00:23:39,438 --> 00:23:43,442
Oh, no. We can't do that anymore.

306
00:23:44,193 --> 00:23:45,611
It's not nice.

307
00:24:38,163 --> 00:24:41,041
Right now I'm not ruling anything out.

308
00:24:41,375 --> 00:24:45,921
Especially since I personally have
never had a case like Kate's before.

309
00:24:46,255 --> 00:24:50,509
But I am looking into
a lot of possibilities.

310
00:24:50,843 --> 00:24:54,263
One of which is called
the Hestia Complex.

311
00:24:55,931 --> 00:24:58,017
Hestia Complex? What is it?

312
00:24:58,434 --> 00:25:02,396
Hestia was a Greek goddess. She was
the goddess of the home and hearth.

313
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:06,442
She kept the fires burning.
She was the guardian of family life.

314
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:12,698
But in an interesting contradiction,
she came to despise love...

315
00:25:13,574 --> 00:25:15,492
...and consequently, to reject it.

316
00:25:18,037 --> 00:25:21,123
Eventually, she retreated
to a single life...

317
00:25:22,833 --> 00:25:25,502
...and peculiarly, was allowed...

318
00:25:25,836 --> 00:25:28,922
...to become the guardian
of virginal modesty.

319
00:25:31,133 --> 00:25:33,344
What has all this got to do with Kate?

320
00:25:35,471 --> 00:25:40,643
In clinical psychology, as well
as in my own documented theories...

321
00:25:40,976 --> 00:25:42,561
...which are based in mythology...

322
00:25:42,895 --> 00:25:45,314
...virgin essentially means child.

323
00:25:45,898 --> 00:25:49,234
Now Kate has retreated
into a childlike state.

324
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:52,571
There could be any number
of reasons for it.

325
00:25:52,905 --> 00:25:57,534
At this point... And yes, I must...

326
00:25:57,826 --> 00:26:00,746
...look into all the possibilities.
But at this point...

327
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:04,625
...the Hestia Complex
seems the most likely.

328
00:26:14,343 --> 00:26:17,346
All right. Take a deep puff.

329
00:26:21,684 --> 00:26:23,185
All right, no puff.

330
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:28,232
Oh, wow, this fur is great.

331
00:26:28,565 --> 00:26:31,110
Didn't it used to be sheepskin
or something?

332
00:26:31,777 --> 00:26:35,948
My aunt died in August and she gave me
this ratty old mink coat.

333
00:26:36,282 --> 00:26:39,034
It was falling apart,
but the sleeves were still good.

334
00:26:39,618 --> 00:26:42,162
It was just enough to cover
the three rooms.

335
00:26:44,164 --> 00:26:45,624
I left Kate a message...

336
00:26:45,958 --> 00:26:49,461
You're the only one I let smoke
in here. Will you give me a break?

337
00:26:49,795 --> 00:26:53,007
I left Kate a message last week,
but she never called me back.

338
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:57,845
Yeah, well, she's away
for a while now.

339
00:26:58,178 --> 00:27:00,681
Sorry, I haven't been
very good about...

340
00:27:00,973 --> 00:27:02,850
...checking her voice mail.

341
00:27:03,183 --> 00:27:05,019
Look at me. Look up. There.

342
00:27:05,352 --> 00:27:08,272
Actually, I just wanted to talk
to you about something.

343
00:27:08,606 --> 00:27:10,107
What about? Lie down.

344
00:27:10,441 --> 00:27:13,902
Well, I'm president of the Beauty
and Fairness for Dallas Club.

345
00:27:14,236 --> 00:27:15,321
Is that a new club?

346
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:18,699
We're a spinoff of the Garden Club.

347
00:27:19,033 --> 00:27:20,993
We promote women's issues.

348
00:27:21,327 --> 00:27:25,998
We're looking for a male voice to help
present our cause to the city council.

349
00:27:26,332 --> 00:27:27,750
What's the cause?

350
00:27:28,083 --> 00:27:32,004
The freeway issue. We think
one should be named for a woman.

351
00:27:34,214 --> 00:27:37,760
Do you realize that every freeway
in Dallas is named for a man?

352
00:27:50,064 --> 00:27:53,525
I'm so terribly sorry.
I hope you'll forgive me.

353
00:28:06,789 --> 00:28:08,916
- Hi, Peggy!
- Hey, honey!

354
00:28:09,249 --> 00:28:11,710
- How are you?
- You look so wonderful.

355
00:28:17,508 --> 00:28:21,011
Connie, did you see that? Hi, Judy.

356
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:27,059
- Oh, hey, Peggy, nice to see you.
- We're going to see Dad.

357
00:28:27,351 --> 00:28:29,603
We need to talk to him about Mom.

358
00:28:29,895 --> 00:28:32,690
Dad, we're here.
Could you come here please?

359
00:28:34,024 --> 00:28:35,818
So will you help us?

360
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:38,946
Well, who do you have so far?

361
00:28:40,322 --> 00:28:41,490
Annette Strauss, for one.

362
00:28:41,824 --> 00:28:44,159
Oh, Annette! God rest her soul.

363
00:28:44,868 --> 00:28:48,747
She was proof that women
make great mayors.

364
00:28:49,248 --> 00:28:52,209
- We also thought about Mary Kay Ash.
- Good choice.

365
00:28:52,543 --> 00:28:54,503
Someone with international influence.

366
00:28:55,087 --> 00:28:57,756
I'm touching your leg and entering.
Easy.

367
00:28:58,090 --> 00:28:59,091
There we are. Okay.

368
00:28:59,425 --> 00:29:01,260
How many names do you need?

369
00:29:01,552 --> 00:29:04,388
Three. You got another suggestion?

370
00:29:05,723 --> 00:29:09,810
What about one to get the attention
of the good ol' boys on the council?

371
00:29:10,728 --> 00:29:12,313
You know, like...

372
00:29:12,646 --> 00:29:13,981
Jayne Mansfield.

373
00:29:14,481 --> 00:29:17,109
All right, that's it. Cutoff.

374
00:29:17,401 --> 00:29:21,071
No more cigarettes in here.
Don't even ask me next time.

375
00:29:22,072 --> 00:29:24,617
Jayne Mansfield. What a great idea.

376
00:29:27,786 --> 00:29:29,455
Hey, Dee Dee, look.

377
00:29:29,788 --> 00:29:33,584
Put that back before he comes in.
That's his drawer.

378
00:29:34,877 --> 00:29:36,879
Hi, everybody. What's up?

379
00:29:37,212 --> 00:29:38,172
Out of my drawers.

380
00:29:38,464 --> 00:29:39,632
Squid, just move on.

381
00:29:39,924 --> 00:29:42,885
- I hate "Squid."
- I hate when you're in my drawers.

382
00:29:43,218 --> 00:29:47,389
Sully, we're just so sorry
to interrupt your busy day.

383
00:29:47,723 --> 00:29:50,184
He's writing up a prescription.

384
00:29:50,517 --> 00:29:52,561
Take this out of samples.

385
00:29:53,354 --> 00:29:56,231
I don't want to see her
for three months.

386
00:29:56,565 --> 00:29:58,233
- Okay.
- You want me to shut the door?

387
00:29:58,567 --> 00:29:59,985
Please. Thanks.

388
00:30:00,277 --> 00:30:02,780
- Thanks, Carolyn.
- What's up?

389
00:30:03,822 --> 00:30:07,618
We just wanted to take
a few minutes and talk about Kate.

390
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,287
- We're real concerned.
- Basically...

391
00:30:10,621 --> 00:30:12,539
...we should get Mom out.

392
00:30:12,873 --> 00:30:15,709
I see no reason why she
can't stay home with us.

393
00:30:16,001 --> 00:30:17,711
You know we can't do that.

394
00:30:18,045 --> 00:30:20,756
The psychiatric hospital is
the best place for her.

395
00:30:21,298 --> 00:30:25,719
They've assured me that
the facility in Tyler is first-rate.

396
00:30:26,512 --> 00:30:29,556
Dr. Harper talks to Kate
several times a day.

397
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:31,350
She says she's happy there.

398
00:30:31,684 --> 00:30:33,978
Do we really know that she's happy?

399
00:30:34,311 --> 00:30:38,023
I mean, if we haven't seen her?

400
00:30:39,024 --> 00:30:41,151
Kate's been there three weeks.

401
00:30:41,652 --> 00:30:44,405
She hasn't asked about us once.
Any of us.

402
00:30:44,738 --> 00:30:47,866
- I don't believe it.
- Dr. Harper said that?

403
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:51,161
Does anybody have any idea
what's wrong with her yet?

404
00:30:52,037 --> 00:30:54,164
They're about as stumped as we are.

405
00:30:54,498 --> 00:30:57,501
Dad, that's exactly why
we need to bring her home.

406
00:30:57,793 --> 00:30:59,628
At least we could take care of her.

407
00:30:59,962 --> 00:31:03,048
Well, Dr. Harper did say one thing.

408
00:31:04,341 --> 00:31:05,551
What?

409
00:31:05,884 --> 00:31:08,679
There is a rare...

410
00:31:11,056 --> 00:31:13,892
...mental disorder that they're just
learning about right now.

411
00:31:14,226 --> 00:31:18,397
It's a condition, a complex,
called the Hestia Complex.

412
00:31:18,731 --> 00:31:20,566
- Hestia Complex?
- I don't know it.

413
00:31:20,858 --> 00:31:23,277
Apparently it only affects women.

414
00:31:24,987 --> 00:31:29,950
From the few studies they've done,
women who are most susceptible...

415
00:31:32,995 --> 00:31:34,371
Are what?

416
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,041
Say it, Dad.

417
00:31:37,333 --> 00:31:39,126
Women who are loved too much.

418
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,461
Loved too much?

419
00:31:40,794 --> 00:31:44,298
Mom has this disease
because we love her too much?

420
00:31:44,715 --> 00:31:47,092
I think you've gone crazy, Daddy.

421
00:31:47,426 --> 00:31:48,719
It's not about you.

422
00:31:49,053 --> 00:31:51,055
But that sounds very strange.

423
00:31:51,388 --> 00:31:53,557
Listen to me. Understand me. Now.

424
00:31:53,849 --> 00:31:56,602
This is not because of anything
you have done. It's me.

425
00:31:56,936 --> 00:31:59,396
What do you mean, Sully?

426
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:01,273
Listen. Dr. Harper says...

427
00:32:01,607 --> 00:32:03,317
Dr. Harper.

428
00:32:03,651 --> 00:32:07,947
...this syndrome, or this Hestia
thing, whatever this thing is...

429
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,407
...this is something that attacks...

430
00:32:10,991 --> 00:32:12,701
...mostly upper-class women who...

431
00:32:13,702 --> 00:32:16,246
Who have pretty much
everything they need...

432
00:32:17,164 --> 00:32:19,917
...in a material sense
and in a family sense too.

433
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:21,710
But they also have...

434
00:32:22,336 --> 00:32:25,005
...well, a man, a husband who...

435
00:32:26,423 --> 00:32:28,759
...loves them and adores them...

436
00:32:30,094 --> 00:32:31,929
...is faithful and respects them...

437
00:32:32,263 --> 00:32:35,224
...always puts them first,
totally takes care of them...

438
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:37,434
...makes them feel beautiful.

439
00:32:37,768 --> 00:32:39,603
There's nothing wrong with that.

440
00:32:39,937 --> 00:32:42,147
Daddy, this is ridiculous!

441
00:32:42,481 --> 00:32:43,774
- Go on, Daddy.
- Excuse me.

442
00:32:44,108 --> 00:32:44,858
Supposedly...

443
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:48,988
...their mundane fears
and worries...

444
00:32:49,321 --> 00:32:50,906
...have been eliminated.

445
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:54,285
They lose their motivation
and their reason...

446
00:32:55,536 --> 00:32:59,081
...to improve things because
their lives are already perfect.

447
00:33:00,207 --> 00:33:02,960
Dr. Harper says they often retreat...

448
00:33:03,252 --> 00:33:05,254
...into a childlike state.

449
00:33:07,298 --> 00:33:10,050
It's probably a desperate attempt...

450
00:33:10,968 --> 00:33:12,761
...to regain some of the...

451
00:33:15,139 --> 00:33:16,140
The what?

452
00:33:18,809 --> 00:33:19,768
The mystery.

453
00:33:22,313 --> 00:33:24,398
Dr. T, we have...

454
00:33:24,732 --> 00:33:26,317
Give us a couple minutes.

455
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:28,360
Oh, of course I will.

456
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:35,743
This doesn't make sense.

457
00:33:36,076 --> 00:33:40,956
I gotta go to cheerleading practice
and if I'm late, I swear to God...

458
00:33:41,915 --> 00:33:45,294
I love you. Everything will
be fine. Don't look so depressed.

459
00:33:46,921 --> 00:33:47,922
I love you.

460
00:33:48,255 --> 00:33:50,507
I'll see you later.
You'd better...

461
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:53,510
...Altoid... mint... there.

462
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,930
Bye, y'all.

463
00:33:57,056 --> 00:33:59,266
I got the Fourth of July
pictures out...

464
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:03,771
...and I was thinking it might
be nice to give them to Kate.

465
00:34:04,396 --> 00:34:07,316
I don't know.
I'll ask Dr. Harper about it.

466
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:11,028
I'm just so worried. Especially
if they have her on medication...

467
00:34:11,487 --> 00:34:13,697
I hate this even more than you do...

468
00:34:14,031 --> 00:34:17,034
...but we have to trust the doctor.
- My butt looks huge!

469
00:34:17,368 --> 00:34:18,369
It's disgusting.

470
00:34:18,702 --> 00:34:21,455
What did you do?
Don't tear my family pictures!

471
00:34:21,789 --> 00:34:23,707
Give me the other half.

472
00:34:24,041 --> 00:34:27,544
- I wouldn't photograph your butt.
- They are my family photos.

473
00:34:27,878 --> 00:34:30,756
I've got patients lined up out there
right now, so...

474
00:34:31,048 --> 00:34:34,343
We're sorry we're taking up
all your time.

475
00:34:34,677 --> 00:34:37,221
You give me some good sugar.

476
00:34:38,347 --> 00:34:40,391
- Love you too.
- Love you more.

477
00:34:40,724 --> 00:34:42,851
Have a good day. See you at home.

478
00:34:46,939 --> 00:34:47,898
Hey, handsome.

479
00:34:48,983 --> 00:34:49,942
What do we got?

480
00:34:50,276 --> 00:34:51,360
You all ready?

481
00:34:52,027 --> 00:34:57,324
Hildy is in Governor Ann Richards,
and she's got another bad infection.

482
00:34:57,658 --> 00:35:02,037
In Phyllis George we have Dorothy
Chamblis again for another exam...

483
00:35:02,329 --> 00:35:04,123
I know. Just go in there and...

484
00:35:04,456 --> 00:35:06,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. What's next?

485
00:35:06,333 --> 00:35:08,794
And the new patient
I put in Belle Starr.

486
00:35:10,504 --> 00:35:12,840
- So there you go.
- Thank you, Carolyn.

487
00:35:16,427 --> 00:35:18,262
Hey, you need something?

488
00:35:20,472 --> 00:35:22,016
No, I'll be right there.

489
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:34,361
Okay, ladies.
Listen up before we start practice.

490
00:35:34,695 --> 00:35:36,447
We've got good news and bad news.

491
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:40,409
Rhonda's injury will keep her out
for the rest of the season.

492
00:35:40,951 --> 00:35:43,704
The good news is,
we have a replacement.

493
00:35:44,038 --> 00:35:45,914
This is Dee Dee Travis, everybody.

494
00:35:46,248 --> 00:35:48,375
Dee Dee's an alternate
we had from auditions.

495
00:35:48,667 --> 00:35:49,835
Welcome, Dee Dee.

496
00:35:50,294 --> 00:35:51,670
So y'all ready?

497
00:35:52,004 --> 00:35:55,382
Let's hit our first position
so we can fit Dee Dee in.

498
00:35:55,716 --> 00:35:57,301
We're gonna make a few changes.

499
00:35:57,635 --> 00:36:01,555
Alice, take Rhonda's position.
We'll put Dee Dee in your spot.

500
00:36:01,847 --> 00:36:05,017
- Yes, ma'am.
- That's right here behind Megan.

501
00:36:05,309 --> 00:36:07,394
Help her if she does
something wrong...

502
00:36:07,728 --> 00:36:11,148
...because she doesn't know
this choreography very well yet.

503
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,610
What foot... Excuse me, ma'am,
what foot do you start on?

504
00:36:14,944 --> 00:36:15,736
Right foot.

505
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:18,155
Tap your right foot, Dee Dee,
to start.

506
00:36:18,489 --> 00:36:20,115
Five, six, seven, eight. Go.

507
00:36:20,449 --> 00:36:24,495
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, stop.

508
00:36:24,828 --> 00:36:28,540
Dee Dee, on five you need to look
over to the right. Five...

509
00:36:28,832 --> 00:36:31,710
Right behind me, we have
the famous sixth floor window...

510
00:36:32,044 --> 00:36:35,839
...where Oswald supposedly shot JFK.

511
00:36:36,131 --> 00:36:38,175
So you're telling me
Oswald didn't do it?

512
00:36:38,509 --> 00:36:41,095
Well, there's many
conspiracy theories on that.

513
00:36:41,428 --> 00:36:43,597
You'll have to decide
which one you believe.

514
00:36:43,931 --> 00:36:45,432
What kind of a rifle did he use?

515
00:36:45,724 --> 00:36:49,561
Well, the Warren Commission says,
in their exhibit number 139...

516
00:36:49,853 --> 00:36:52,731
One and two, three, four, five...

517
00:36:53,065 --> 00:36:54,358
...and seven and...

518
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:58,570
...one, two, look three, down four,
and shimmy, shimmy, up, up...

519
00:36:58,904 --> 00:37:02,241
...travel two, and three,
and four, and down.

520
00:37:02,574 --> 00:37:05,452
That's okay.
Take about a five-minute break.

521
00:37:05,744 --> 00:37:10,249
Let me see Group 1.
Put your pom-pons down.

522
00:37:10,666 --> 00:37:11,834
Okay, ready?

523
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:16,797
I have to make a call.
Will you cover for me?

524
00:37:20,551 --> 00:37:23,387
So Oswald supposedly used
this 23-year-old...

525
00:37:23,721 --> 00:37:26,932
...antiquated Army surplus rifle...

526
00:37:28,934 --> 00:37:31,854
...to fire at the president
from sixth-floor window.

527
00:37:32,187 --> 00:37:35,316
Which leads us right there,
guys, to the X.

528
00:37:35,941 --> 00:37:40,279
That's where JFK's head exploded!

529
00:37:40,613 --> 00:37:41,947
Excuse me for a second.

530
00:37:43,991 --> 00:37:45,701
I forgot to tell you something.

531
00:37:45,993 --> 00:37:47,119
I can't hear you.

532
00:37:47,411 --> 00:37:49,288
It's loud, but I can't talk loud.

533
00:37:49,622 --> 00:37:51,790
Is this important? I'm doing my tour.

534
00:37:52,124 --> 00:37:54,460
Connie, it's about my bridesmaids.

535
00:37:55,419 --> 00:37:56,921
What about the bridesmaids?

536
00:37:57,212 --> 00:38:00,299
Well, I finally decided who
my maid of honour will be.

537
00:38:02,509 --> 00:38:04,386
- Who did you choose?
- Marilyn.

538
00:38:04,762 --> 00:38:07,181
Come on, Dee Dee.
That snotty cheerleader?

539
00:38:07,473 --> 00:38:10,184
No, Marilyn from Houston.

540
00:38:11,101 --> 00:38:13,479
Oh, Dee Dee. Not Marilyn.

541
00:38:14,438 --> 00:38:17,399
Dee Dee, are you sure
you thought this through?

542
00:38:17,733 --> 00:38:21,570
I'm positive. I talked
to her last night, and she's pumped.

543
00:38:21,862 --> 00:38:23,572
She's coming up
for the get-together.

544
00:38:23,906 --> 00:38:26,325
I don't think
it's a good idea, Dee Dee.

545
00:38:27,034 --> 00:38:30,329
There we go. All right.
Easy, easy.

546
00:38:30,663 --> 00:38:33,874
Right there. You feel a lump, right?

547
00:38:34,166 --> 00:38:36,168
That's normal. That's fine.

548
00:38:40,005 --> 00:38:41,423
Normal. Normal.

549
00:38:41,715 --> 00:38:42,675
Dorothy...

550
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,677
...you are a specimen.

551
00:38:45,094 --> 00:38:49,056
The picture of health.
Nothing to worry about whatsoever.

552
00:38:49,682 --> 00:38:51,392
You're absolutely perfect.

553
00:38:54,478 --> 00:38:56,605
Are you sure, Dr. T?

554
00:38:56,939 --> 00:38:59,650
I've been feeling kind of funny
the past couple days.

555
00:38:59,984 --> 00:39:03,904
No, no, positive.
No, everything looks great.

556
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,323
You look absolutely fantastic,
actually.

557
00:39:06,907 --> 00:39:08,617
You look wonderful.
Just great.

558
00:39:08,951 --> 00:39:10,786
Does anyone tell you that lately?

559
00:39:11,787 --> 00:39:13,914
- No.
- No?

560
00:39:16,166 --> 00:39:17,668
Well, yes.

561
00:39:18,002 --> 00:39:20,796
You and...

562
00:39:22,965 --> 00:39:24,341
...your nurse...

563
00:39:27,428 --> 00:39:31,849
...and your bookkeeper and your
receptionist, as a matter of fact.

564
00:39:32,141 --> 00:39:35,352
- All in the last ten minutes.
- Then it must be true.

565
00:39:36,729 --> 00:39:40,399
But they told me the same thing
when I was here two weeks ago.

566
00:39:41,191 --> 00:39:44,987
And the time before that.
In fact, they always say that.

567
00:39:46,572 --> 00:39:48,949
Dr. T? Sorry.
Barbara Lloyd's in labour.

568
00:39:49,241 --> 00:39:51,660
Her husband called.
They're on their way to the hospital.

569
00:39:52,536 --> 00:39:53,996
You can get dressed now.

570
00:39:54,747 --> 00:39:56,373
Tell them I'm on my way too.

571
00:39:57,666 --> 00:39:59,376
- That's it?
- That's it.

572
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,428
I'm sorry, gotta go.

573
00:40:09,762 --> 00:40:11,263
Delivering a baby. Twins.

574
00:40:11,555 --> 00:40:12,848
We can cancel the rest.

575
00:40:13,182 --> 00:40:16,477
Man, I have been here
for an hour and a half...

576
00:40:17,269 --> 00:40:18,812
Ladies, thank you. I'm sorry.

577
00:40:19,146 --> 00:40:22,316
- Judy, take care of them soon.
- All right, Dr. T.

578
00:40:22,691 --> 00:40:25,694
I've got a load of messages here.
Are you coming back?

579
00:40:26,028 --> 00:40:27,696
- Doubtful.
- Call me anyway.

580
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,338
- Samples. I get them for free.
- Do I get them for free?

581
00:40:44,672 --> 00:40:47,675
Duck season opens next week.
Why don't we get some?

582
00:40:48,008 --> 00:40:50,261
- I'm in. I'm in.
- All right.

583
00:41:20,916 --> 00:41:23,002
Oh, my God!

584
00:41:23,919 --> 00:41:26,338
- Hello there.
- Hey, Bree.

585
00:41:27,506 --> 00:41:30,301
- Here's a dry one.
- Thank you very much.

586
00:41:32,344 --> 00:41:33,846
Oh, my God.

587
00:41:36,932 --> 00:41:41,270
- You always that good?
- Well, when it matters I seem to be.

588
00:41:41,604 --> 00:41:43,439
Which is all the time, right?

589
00:41:44,773 --> 00:41:46,900
Harlan told me you play on the tour.

590
00:41:47,234 --> 00:41:49,528
Yeah, almost ten years now.

591
00:41:49,862 --> 00:41:53,073
- Are you off-season now?
- No, just taking some time off.

592
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:54,950
Sort of indefinitely.

593
00:41:55,284 --> 00:41:57,953
If I'm gonna get nine holes in today,
I better go.

594
00:41:58,287 --> 00:41:59,538
- You got a partner?
- No.

595
00:41:59,872 --> 00:42:01,165
You want one?

596
00:42:01,832 --> 00:42:04,126
- Well, your cart or mine?
- Mine's dry.

597
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:07,212
- Let's take yours.
- All right.

598
00:42:07,922 --> 00:42:11,175
No, I got it. I got it.

599
00:42:16,931 --> 00:42:17,932
- You got it?
- Yep.

600
00:42:19,058 --> 00:42:20,976
Oh, my God.

601
00:42:25,272 --> 00:42:27,566
- Nice shoes.
- Oh, thank you.

602
00:42:32,905 --> 00:42:34,114
Shall we go?

603
00:42:36,909 --> 00:42:38,285
Yeah.

604
00:43:03,894 --> 00:43:08,941
Group 3 will be going to Washington
DC to visit the White House.

605
00:43:09,692 --> 00:43:11,360
Anyone on the alternate status...

606
00:43:11,694 --> 00:43:14,989
...will be doing the performance
at the Huntsville Prison Rodeo.

607
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:19,827
Of course, we have two football
games in the next couple weeks.

608
00:43:22,037 --> 00:43:24,873
- Whose phone is that?
- It's not mine.

609
00:43:25,165 --> 00:43:27,293
It's gotta be somebody's phone.
Whose is it?

610
00:43:28,836 --> 00:43:31,255
You know, it's probably mine.

611
00:43:33,173 --> 00:43:34,383
I think I left it on.

612
00:43:35,759 --> 00:43:38,345
I'll just be right over here.

613
00:43:40,806 --> 00:43:41,974
It's an emergency.

614
00:43:42,266 --> 00:43:44,893
Take your emergency
to the locker room.

615
00:43:45,185 --> 00:43:46,687
Yes, ma'am.

616
00:43:47,688 --> 00:43:48,731
Now, where was I?

617
00:43:49,023 --> 00:43:51,317
Dee Dee, it's Connie.
Listen, I've only got a second.

618
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:54,069
The Zapruder film starts soon
so don't interrupt me.

619
00:43:54,361 --> 00:43:55,779
Girl, what do you want?

620
00:43:56,113 --> 00:43:58,866
We need to talk about
this Marilyn situation.

621
00:43:59,325 --> 00:44:03,829
Has it ever occurred to you that
she has something else up her sleeve?

622
00:44:04,163 --> 00:44:06,498
Besides being your maid of honour?

623
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:10,002
This is really a bad time.
I have to go.

624
00:44:10,628 --> 00:44:13,380
You know what? Something else
just occurred to me.

625
00:44:14,048 --> 00:44:15,799
The wedding shouldn't be outdoors.

626
00:44:16,133 --> 00:44:17,343
Why not?

627
00:44:17,676 --> 00:44:21,221
Because this is Texas, you know.
You can't count on the weather.

628
00:44:21,555 --> 00:44:24,266
Fall is the most beautiful
time of year in Texas.

629
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:28,228
It'll be beautiful out by the lake.
I'm willing to take that chance.

630
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:30,397
Dee Dee, listen.

631
00:44:30,731 --> 00:44:34,652
Fall storms are like snipers, and
they hit you when you least expect.

632
00:44:39,198 --> 00:44:44,244
So you've been in the top 25
for the last four years.

633
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:45,913
What made you walk away?

634
00:44:46,246 --> 00:44:49,041
Nobody believes me when I say this...

635
00:44:49,333 --> 00:44:51,543
...but I just stopped having fun.

636
00:44:51,919 --> 00:44:53,754
It became about something else.

637
00:44:54,046 --> 00:44:57,174
It became about not losing
instead of winning.

638
00:44:57,466 --> 00:45:01,136
It became about relief instead of joy.

639
00:45:01,679 --> 00:45:03,847
It became about the game
instead of me.

640
00:45:04,139 --> 00:45:05,349
Well, I believe you.

641
00:45:06,725 --> 00:45:08,435
- You do?
- Yes, I do.

642
00:45:17,403 --> 00:45:19,405
- Pass some more dough, Amber.
- That's good!

643
00:45:20,489 --> 00:45:23,450
I think the phone is ringing.
Where's the phone, Maria?

644
00:45:23,742 --> 00:45:27,413
- It should be here.
- I don't have enough dough.

645
00:45:27,705 --> 00:45:28,998
- Where is it?
- Hello?

646
00:45:29,290 --> 00:45:33,168
Hi, Amber!
Hey, it's your cousin Deeds.

647
00:45:33,502 --> 00:45:34,461
Hi, Aunt Peggy.

648
00:45:34,753 --> 00:45:38,716
Hey, honey! Hi.
We're baking away here.

649
00:45:39,049 --> 00:45:41,343
So you'll have treats
when you get home.

650
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,722
Looks like I'm packing up
to go to Huntsville.

651
00:45:45,014 --> 00:45:48,058
- Lf I even make it to next week.
- What do you mean, sweetie?

652
00:45:48,392 --> 00:45:52,771
Well, I left my cell phone on
during rehearsal.

653
00:45:53,105 --> 00:45:55,357
It just kept ringing and ringing.

654
00:45:57,359 --> 00:46:01,655
And rumour has it I'm gonna
be on the wait-warning list.

655
00:46:01,989 --> 00:46:05,993
Wait, what do you mean?
I really think it's crazy, you know?

656
00:46:06,327 --> 00:46:09,747
I mean, your body's so cute and...

657
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:12,917
Everybody will try to make you
something you're not.

658
00:46:13,208 --> 00:46:15,294
Or already are
and they don't see it...

659
00:46:15,586 --> 00:46:20,382
...or have some ridiculous concept
or idea of a body from a magazine.

660
00:46:20,716 --> 00:46:22,801
At least the prisoners won't mind.

661
00:46:23,135 --> 00:46:26,889
Listen, Aunt Peg, Connie called
me just a little while ago.

662
00:46:27,389 --> 00:46:30,309
She's trying to talk me out
of having an outdoor wedding.

663
00:46:30,643 --> 00:46:32,561
That's what you want, isn't it?

664
00:46:32,853 --> 00:46:36,649
I really, really want to have
my wedding out by the lake.

665
00:46:36,982 --> 00:46:39,026
It's really important to me,
and it is my wedding.

666
00:46:39,318 --> 00:46:41,570
- It is your wedding.
- Connie's so stubborn.

667
00:46:41,904 --> 00:46:43,781
It's not her wedding.
She'll have a wedding.

668
00:46:44,114 --> 00:46:47,952
One day, you'll start telling her
how she should have her wedding.

669
00:46:48,243 --> 00:46:51,330
I just want your support
if it comes up again.

670
00:46:51,622 --> 00:46:53,749
Well, that is what I'm here for.

671
00:46:54,041 --> 00:46:55,626
Aunts and grandmas, right?

672
00:46:55,960 --> 00:47:00,047
The unconditional love, hopefully.
That's what I want to give y'all.

673
00:47:00,381 --> 00:47:05,344
That you know, I mean, I will support
you 100 trillion-billion percent.

674
00:47:06,178 --> 00:47:09,390
Dee Dee, can I see you
in my office please?

675
00:47:09,723 --> 00:47:12,935
- Right now, ma'am?
- Yeah, it'll just take a minute.

676
00:47:13,936 --> 00:47:15,229
Yes, ma'am.

677
00:47:16,814 --> 00:47:18,357
I'll call you later.

678
00:47:18,857 --> 00:47:20,651
Shoot.

679
00:47:24,071 --> 00:47:25,447
- Good luck.
- Bye, Dee Dee.

680
00:47:26,532 --> 00:47:29,743
You deliver babies.
My God, what a thing!

681
00:47:30,077 --> 00:47:32,246
Being there for a person's
first breath!

682
00:47:32,579 --> 00:47:33,497
Yeah, it's awesome.

683
00:47:33,831 --> 00:47:37,084
You know, I delivered twin girls
a couple of hours ago.

684
00:47:37,459 --> 00:47:39,253
One was right on top of the other.

685
00:47:39,587 --> 00:47:42,590
It was touch-and-go which one
was gonna come out first.

686
00:47:42,923 --> 00:47:45,301
That is exciting. Yeah.

687
00:47:46,343 --> 00:47:47,761
You know, I've delivered...

688
00:47:48,971 --> 00:47:51,932
Oh, God, I don't know,
22 sets of twins.

689
00:47:52,224 --> 00:47:53,309
Yeah, 22.

690
00:47:53,601 --> 00:47:57,563
One thing I've noticed is that
if at least one of them is a boy...

691
00:47:57,896 --> 00:48:00,316
...there's an order
about how they arrive.

692
00:48:00,649 --> 00:48:03,110
Like they made a game plan
ahead of time.

693
00:48:03,402 --> 00:48:08,449
One sits there waiting patiently
while the other one's born.

694
00:48:08,824 --> 00:48:11,744
But invariably, if both
are female, forget it.

695
00:48:12,494 --> 00:48:14,872
It's one big race to the finish line.

696
00:48:21,337 --> 00:48:22,504
- Nice shot.
- Thank you.

697
00:48:22,838 --> 00:48:25,132
- What do you think that means?
- I don't know.

698
00:48:25,466 --> 00:48:28,218
I got it, I got it, I got it.
Thank you.

699
00:48:28,552 --> 00:48:31,764
- I'm not a twin. I don't have sisters.
- No sisters?

700
00:48:32,139 --> 00:48:34,683
- Any brothers?
- Three.

701
00:48:35,976 --> 00:48:37,895
- Do you have kids?
- Two daughters.

702
00:48:38,354 --> 00:48:42,816
- Well, that must be fun.
- Yeah, most of the time.

703
00:48:43,609 --> 00:48:46,362
Both of them are a little nuts
right now.

704
00:48:49,448 --> 00:48:53,035
One's getting married
and the other's kind of jealous.

705
00:48:53,410 --> 00:48:54,411
You're driving?

706
00:48:59,333 --> 00:49:02,628
Yeah, I think they both miss
their mother right now too.

707
00:49:05,965 --> 00:49:07,633
So how's your wife doing?

708
00:49:08,842 --> 00:49:10,135
Not so good.

709
00:49:11,428 --> 00:49:12,638
She's...

710
00:49:16,141 --> 00:49:17,851
Been a long time.

711
00:49:22,273 --> 00:49:24,358
Look how good they turned out!

712
00:49:24,650 --> 00:49:27,278
Your hearts, how pretty.

713
00:49:27,611 --> 00:49:30,030
- Isn't that good?
- Yeah.

714
00:49:30,322 --> 00:49:32,241
You did so good.

715
00:49:34,034 --> 00:49:35,911
Thank you. Hello?

716
00:49:36,203 --> 00:49:37,079
Thank you, ma'am.

717
00:49:37,413 --> 00:49:41,250
- Listen, it's Connie.
- Hey, honey. How are you?

718
00:49:41,584 --> 00:49:44,044
I just talked to Dee Dee
a little bit ago.

719
00:49:44,378 --> 00:49:47,673
She's continuing to insist
on this outdoor wedding idea...

720
00:49:47,965 --> 00:49:50,301
...which I just think
is just completely insane.

721
00:49:50,634 --> 00:49:54,263
Not to mention dangerous
for all of us.

722
00:49:54,597 --> 00:49:56,223
Why do you think so?

723
00:49:56,557 --> 00:49:58,517
Peggy, I just know it's gonna rain.

724
00:49:58,851 --> 00:50:03,022
That means it'll be a huge
problem for everyone in the family.

725
00:50:03,314 --> 00:50:08,027
It's not necessary. We're better off
having it indoors where it's safe.

726
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:09,612
She's gonna call you.

727
00:50:09,945 --> 00:50:12,489
I need you to convince her
to have it indoors.

728
00:50:12,781 --> 00:50:15,826
- It might be better.
- It'll be a huge problem for us.

729
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,162
- We won't want to deal with it.
- Indoors.

730
00:50:18,621 --> 00:50:20,456
I'm right on this one. Trust me.

731
00:50:20,789 --> 00:50:22,499
I think you're right.

732
00:50:22,833 --> 00:50:25,461
So I need you to be on my side, okay?

733
00:50:25,794 --> 00:50:27,546
We all have to go indoors.

734
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:30,925
- You promise?
- Inside. Turn, turn inside.

735
00:50:31,216 --> 00:50:32,551
- Thanks, Peggy.
- Turn within.

736
00:50:32,843 --> 00:50:35,846
All right. I'll talk to you later.
Okay, bye.

737
00:50:38,933 --> 00:50:41,268
Can I have some milk with my cookies?

738
00:50:46,023 --> 00:50:47,900
Oh, shoot!

739
00:50:50,486 --> 00:50:51,612
You're amazing, Bree.

740
00:50:51,946 --> 00:50:55,908
I have never seen a woman like you.
I got it.

741
00:50:56,617 --> 00:50:57,576
Really?

742
00:50:58,410 --> 00:50:59,703
- Never?
- Never.

743
00:50:59,995 --> 00:51:02,790
Let me ask you something.
You see women all day, every day.

744
00:51:03,123 --> 00:51:05,668
How do they keep
from just running together?

745
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:09,463
I think every single woman
I have ever met...

746
00:51:09,797 --> 00:51:11,507
...got something special about her.

747
00:51:11,799 --> 00:51:14,635
Something that sets her apart
from the rest.

748
00:51:16,762 --> 00:51:20,224
Well, if a gynaecologist says
there's no two alike...

749
00:51:20,516 --> 00:51:22,768
...I guess there's no two alike.

750
00:51:31,944 --> 00:51:34,196
Maria? No, thank you.

751
00:51:34,488 --> 00:51:36,657
- Has Marilyn called?
- Not yet.

752
00:51:36,991 --> 00:51:38,867
Hello! Hi, sweetie.

753
00:51:39,201 --> 00:51:40,577
- How are you?
- Good, come on in.

754
00:51:40,911 --> 00:51:43,372
- Hi! Good to see you.
- Good to see you too.

755
00:51:43,956 --> 00:51:45,457
Who's this from?

756
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:46,750
There's no card.

757
00:51:47,084 --> 00:51:48,335
Who's this from?

758
00:51:48,627 --> 00:51:50,087
- Dee Dee?
- Yeah.

759
00:51:50,421 --> 00:51:52,256
- Look at that.
- That is...

760
00:51:52,590 --> 00:51:54,300
Let's go in the other room.

761
00:51:56,176 --> 00:51:56,927
Maria?

762
00:51:57,219 --> 00:52:01,348
Maria, could you wrap this stuff for
me, please? It's getting cluttered.

763
00:52:04,935 --> 00:52:06,937
I think you should wear this.

764
00:52:07,271 --> 00:52:10,232
Oh, my God! Honey, when is it due?

765
00:52:12,943 --> 00:52:16,572
- I'm Marilyn.
- Oh, Marilyn, the maid of honour.

766
00:52:16,905 --> 00:52:20,242
Happy to meet you, I'm Peggy.
Let me get this door.

767
00:52:20,534 --> 00:52:23,662
- Nice to meet you too. Champagne?
- No, I'm okay.

768
00:52:23,996 --> 00:52:26,373
- Well, can I take your coat?
- Sure.

769
00:52:30,669 --> 00:52:33,130
Nobody can know.

770
00:52:33,422 --> 00:52:35,507
She said you drove a long way.

771
00:52:35,841 --> 00:52:38,385
- Look who's here.
- Hi, sweetheart!

772
00:52:41,138 --> 00:52:43,682
I've been waiting for you.

773
00:52:44,016 --> 00:52:46,477
You look so beautiful.
You're so precious.

774
00:52:46,810 --> 00:52:48,854
Champagne to offer to her.

775
00:52:49,146 --> 00:52:51,023
You know, it might be nice...

776
00:52:52,942 --> 00:52:55,945
...to open presents, and maybe
Marilyn would like...

777
00:52:56,236 --> 00:52:59,073
Everybody, this is Marilyn.

778
00:52:59,406 --> 00:53:01,408
Maid of honour!

779
00:53:01,742 --> 00:53:04,328
Everybody over here, this is Marilyn.

780
00:53:05,496 --> 00:53:06,580
This is Marilyn.

781
00:53:06,914 --> 00:53:08,707
She's having a little breakdown now.

782
00:53:09,041 --> 00:53:12,294
Everybody knows that it will be fine.

783
00:53:13,379 --> 00:53:16,006
Could somebody give Marilyn a chair?

784
00:53:16,465 --> 00:53:18,634
Can you get her a chair, please?

785
00:53:18,968 --> 00:53:22,513
- Marilyn needs a chair.
- That's not my problem.

786
00:53:27,685 --> 00:53:29,103
So how was the trip?

787
00:53:30,771 --> 00:53:31,730
How are you doing?

788
00:53:32,523 --> 00:53:34,858
This is from your mother.

789
00:53:35,192 --> 00:53:37,444
All her love in the world.

790
00:53:38,779 --> 00:53:39,530
Cheese.

791
00:53:42,741 --> 00:53:45,327
Sorry, you all right?
Okay, come and sit down.

792
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:50,708
I got two weeks' worth of estrogen
and progesterone.

793
00:53:51,041 --> 00:53:53,419
And one tablet.

794
00:53:53,752 --> 00:53:55,796
The hot flashes should go
away immediately.

795
00:53:56,088 --> 00:53:58,090
It'll be good for your
mood swings too.

796
00:53:58,382 --> 00:54:01,677
Now remember, please call me.

797
00:54:02,219 --> 00:54:05,598
Anytime there's anything you
want to talk about. Okay?

798
00:54:05,931 --> 00:54:07,766
- Sure.
- I'm always here for you.

799
00:54:13,897 --> 00:54:15,524
Thanks.

800
00:54:20,070 --> 00:54:24,533
You know, Christine, I
try to tell all my patients...

801
00:54:24,867 --> 00:54:27,953
...that menopause is no different
than going through puberty.

802
00:54:30,289 --> 00:54:34,585
Your body's changing.
Your hormones are all over the place.

803
00:54:34,877 --> 00:54:39,590
You're so much more sensitive
and emotional than you normally are.

804
00:54:39,924 --> 00:54:42,718
You're not sure what's happening,
but I promise you...

805
00:54:43,052 --> 00:54:46,847
...if you don't let it scare you,
if you don't get upset...

806
00:54:47,181 --> 00:54:50,476
...if you could just somehow
embrace this thing...

807
00:54:50,809 --> 00:54:54,647
...you're gonna find
a renewed sexiness.

808
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:57,942
A womanliness that you've probably
never felt before.

809
00:54:59,568 --> 00:55:03,197
- Hello, Dr. Tra...
- Whatever. I've been here for an hour.

810
00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:04,823
Bree?

811
00:55:05,157 --> 00:55:10,204
It's just my opinion, but nothing's
more appealing than a woman...

812
00:55:10,621 --> 00:55:12,790
...who's proud to be in her own body.

813
00:55:13,123 --> 00:55:18,087
And believe me, there is nothing...

814
00:55:20,005 --> 00:55:22,758
Marsha, there's no charge
for this visit.

815
00:55:23,050 --> 00:55:25,010
Just call it a free follow-up.

816
00:55:25,302 --> 00:55:26,262
On the house.

817
00:55:26,595 --> 00:55:31,642
You know what? I'll be the best
damn menopause patient you ever had.

818
00:55:32,893 --> 00:55:33,852
That's a promise!

819
00:55:34,186 --> 00:55:37,648
Go, girl! You go, girl!

820
00:55:38,065 --> 00:55:39,650
You want something?

821
00:55:39,942 --> 00:55:43,612
Oh, the phone. On the phone, Bree.
Very pushy.

822
00:55:43,946 --> 00:55:45,030
Want me to handle it?

823
00:55:45,322 --> 00:55:47,700
Why didn't you tell me?
What line is she on?

824
00:55:49,827 --> 00:55:51,161
It's line four!

825
00:55:51,495 --> 00:55:53,163
- Four?
- Four.

826
00:55:54,373 --> 00:55:55,624
- Hey.
- Hey!

827
00:55:55,958 --> 00:55:58,168
It's quite a surprise.

828
00:55:58,502 --> 00:56:01,797
- What's up?
- We got in those steel drivers today.

829
00:56:02,423 --> 00:56:03,424
Did you try one?

830
00:56:03,716 --> 00:56:05,968
You'll hit the ball
10 yards farther.

831
00:56:06,302 --> 00:56:08,804
I'd better go over there
or they'll all be gone.

832
00:56:09,138 --> 00:56:11,599
You gonna be there at 5:30?

833
00:56:11,932 --> 00:56:14,101
Yeah, I get off at 5:00,
then I'm going for a swim.

834
00:56:14,435 --> 00:56:15,477
You'll wait for me?

835
00:56:15,811 --> 00:56:18,105
- Sure.
- Great!

836
00:56:20,399 --> 00:56:22,192
Yeah, I'll...

837
00:56:23,694 --> 00:56:25,446
- I'll see you.
- I'll see you then.

838
00:56:25,779 --> 00:56:29,325
- I'll see you then.
- Okay, bye.

839
00:56:41,837 --> 00:56:42,838
Look at you!

840
00:56:43,172 --> 00:56:45,758
Not bad. It's got a lot
of whip to it.

841
00:56:46,508 --> 00:56:49,595
- I got it.
- It's my job. You hit the ball.

842
00:56:52,806 --> 00:56:54,516
Step up there.

843
00:56:59,438 --> 00:57:01,523
You're really gonna do this?
Okay, go ahead.

844
00:57:01,857 --> 00:57:02,900
That's great.

845
00:57:03,233 --> 00:57:05,486
Put your hands ahead that much.

846
00:57:07,821 --> 00:57:10,032
- I feel a little close to it.
- You're fine.

847
00:57:17,581 --> 00:57:19,166
Damn. Thank you.

848
00:57:20,334 --> 00:57:23,045
Does that club feel like
butter in your hands?

849
00:57:24,046 --> 00:57:26,757
Yeah, just exactly like butter.
It's...

850
00:57:27,091 --> 00:57:30,261
- Funny, I'm really sweating today.
- It's okay, it happens.

851
00:57:31,136 --> 00:57:32,888
What do you do when that happens?

852
00:57:33,973 --> 00:57:36,558
I used to panic and think,
"Concentrate harder."

853
00:57:36,892 --> 00:57:39,561
Now I forget it and wrap them
around a beer.

854
00:57:41,939 --> 00:57:43,816
So you want to get a beer?

855
00:57:47,152 --> 00:57:48,195
Well...

856
00:57:48,529 --> 00:57:50,364
Or maybe dinner?

857
00:57:50,739 --> 00:57:53,826
There's a terrific steak house
out in Belline.

858
00:57:54,952 --> 00:57:57,121
- All right, let's do it.
- Yeah?

859
00:57:58,205 --> 00:57:59,540
Dinner.

860
00:58:02,209 --> 00:58:04,461
Only, I know a better place.

861
00:58:06,213 --> 00:58:07,715
This is amazing.

862
00:58:08,882 --> 00:58:12,636
I haven't seen anything like this
since the jungle ride at Disneyland.

863
00:58:12,970 --> 00:58:16,724
There's a thousand of these in Dallas,
$750 a month.

864
00:58:17,057 --> 00:58:19,643
If the fountain keeps you awake,
they give you free earplugs.

865
00:58:19,977 --> 00:58:23,188
- You have earplugs?
- I have a set of first-time earplugs.

866
00:58:26,525 --> 00:58:28,360
This is it.

867
00:58:29,153 --> 00:58:32,239
- Oh, it's nice.
- Thank you.

868
00:58:32,615 --> 00:58:33,782
It really is nice.

869
00:58:34,074 --> 00:58:35,075
See?

870
00:58:35,409 --> 00:58:37,119
You want to put those right there?

871
00:58:37,453 --> 00:58:39,121
All right, I will.

872
00:58:44,668 --> 00:58:46,337
Here, give me your jacket.

873
00:58:46,670 --> 00:58:48,631
All right.

874
00:58:49,048 --> 00:58:50,132
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

875
00:58:57,306 --> 00:58:59,141
Shall I open a bottle of wine?

876
00:58:59,475 --> 00:59:01,936
- Yeah, do that.
- All right.

877
00:59:20,412 --> 00:59:21,413
You got it?

878
00:59:24,416 --> 00:59:26,961
That's good. Glasses here?

879
00:59:27,253 --> 00:59:28,045
Right there. You know what?

880
00:59:28,379 --> 00:59:31,131
Why don't you light some candles?
You can use that.

881
00:59:32,258 --> 00:59:34,301
- You'll pour wine?
- I'll pour wine.

882
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:55,239
You trust me to do this?

883
00:59:55,572 --> 00:59:56,824
The first time.

884
01:00:22,391 --> 01:00:24,768
- Looks good.
- I hope so.

885
01:00:33,027 --> 01:00:34,737
There we go.

886
01:00:37,573 --> 01:00:39,116
There we go.

887
01:00:39,867 --> 01:00:41,410
That's nice.

888
01:00:44,622 --> 01:00:47,041
- Great, thanks.
- You're welcome.

889
01:00:51,337 --> 01:00:52,504
Cheers.

890
01:00:58,969 --> 01:01:01,764
Will you watch those and
check them in 7 minutes?

891
01:01:02,097 --> 01:01:03,140
I'll be here.

892
01:01:03,474 --> 01:01:06,018
I'll be right back.
I'm gonna change my clothes.

893
01:02:12,042 --> 01:02:13,085
You finished?

894
01:02:13,419 --> 01:02:17,047
- Yes, it was absolutely amazing.
- Good.

895
01:02:17,339 --> 01:02:18,591
Thank you.

896
01:02:50,456 --> 01:02:52,708
You want to close the screen
on the fire?

897
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:54,543
Yeah.

898
01:04:21,797 --> 01:04:24,133
I saw Joanne a few days ago.

899
01:04:24,466 --> 01:04:26,594
- She seemed well, happy.
- Where'd you see her?

900
01:04:26,927 --> 01:04:31,015
She was at the city council's
planning commission meeting.

901
01:04:31,348 --> 01:04:32,891
You know about...

902
01:04:34,101 --> 01:04:37,104
...naming that new highway
after a woman.

903
01:04:37,438 --> 01:04:39,356
I did the presentation for her.

904
01:04:39,648 --> 01:04:42,318
Jesus, that's all she talks
about anymore.

905
01:04:42,610 --> 01:04:43,861
Thanks.

906
01:04:44,612 --> 01:04:46,739
She says if they get turned down...

907
01:04:47,031 --> 01:04:51,619
...they'll all chain themselves to
an overpass on the LBJ and protest.

908
01:04:51,911 --> 01:04:54,413
Women will do anything to
get their way.

909
01:04:54,747 --> 01:04:58,334
Well, not Dorothy.
She's afraid of heights, you know?

910
01:04:58,626 --> 01:05:01,045
Well, Dorothy's got her share
of fears, doesn't she?

911
01:05:01,378 --> 01:05:02,212
What do you mean?

912
01:05:02,546 --> 01:05:05,174
Oh, she stopped by the office
again last week.

913
01:05:05,466 --> 01:05:08,385
She's fine, no problem.
She's looking good.

914
01:05:08,719 --> 01:05:10,012
I told her she was looking good.

915
01:05:10,304 --> 01:05:12,681
- Got anything besides peanut butter?
- No.

916
01:05:12,973 --> 01:05:15,184
She had another appointment
with you last week?

917
01:05:15,517 --> 01:05:17,144
Yeah. You think she's looking good?

918
01:05:18,479 --> 01:05:19,355
Yeah.

919
01:05:19,855 --> 01:05:21,357
I like her new hairstyle.

920
01:05:23,317 --> 01:05:24,485
- Hairstyle?
- Yeah.

921
01:05:24,818 --> 01:05:29,823
The new kind of up thing
she's doing with her hair.

922
01:05:30,532 --> 01:05:32,409
Oh, you mean the hair on her head.

923
01:05:45,130 --> 01:05:47,091
The water's nice.

924
01:05:51,679 --> 01:05:52,429
No.

925
01:05:53,847 --> 01:05:55,933
- You cold?
- No, I'm okay.

926
01:05:56,267 --> 01:05:57,351
You cold?

927
01:05:57,643 --> 01:05:58,894
A little bit.

928
01:06:00,854 --> 01:06:03,941
If we sit here long enough, we'll
see the Lady of the Lake.

929
01:06:04,275 --> 01:06:05,317
Who's that?

930
01:06:05,651 --> 01:06:09,488
You don't know the Lady of the Lake?
It's a famous legend.

931
01:06:11,490 --> 01:06:15,786
This woman in this flowing,
white, exotic negligee...

932
01:06:17,871 --> 01:06:21,792
She drowned... I'm serious.
She drowned because of a broken heart.

933
01:06:22,126 --> 01:06:22,876
Really?

934
01:06:23,210 --> 01:06:26,463
She appears to couples
around the lake who are in love.

935
01:06:26,797 --> 01:06:29,216
And she either cries for help...

936
01:06:29,508 --> 01:06:34,054
...or she just cries this really
sad, mournful cry.

937
01:06:36,432 --> 01:06:40,477
I believe it. I mean,
people swear it's true.

938
01:06:41,020 --> 01:06:42,605
I believe it.

939
01:07:02,124 --> 01:07:04,460
So, Sully. How's Kate doing?

940
01:07:05,419 --> 01:07:09,298
Doing all right, I guess.
According to the doctors.

941
01:07:11,967 --> 01:07:14,094
You mean, they still haven't
let you see her?

942
01:07:15,888 --> 01:07:17,056
No.

943
01:07:18,432 --> 01:07:20,768
They say she needs more time.

944
01:07:22,561 --> 01:07:26,106
I don't know dick about psychology,
or women either for that matter...

945
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:30,611
...but it just doesn't seem right,
them not letting you see her.

946
01:07:30,945 --> 01:07:33,364
She's your wife, for chrissake.

947
01:07:34,281 --> 01:07:37,868
I know. I know, I feel the same way,
but I'm trying to trust them.

948
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:41,205
They say if I do it too soon...

949
01:07:41,497 --> 01:07:44,458
...it'll set her back even farther.

950
01:07:46,460 --> 01:07:47,878
Right there in our decoys.

951
01:07:51,590 --> 01:07:54,134
That wasn't in our decoys,
that was our decoy.

952
01:07:54,468 --> 01:07:57,179
Shit! That's it.
Ready to go, Eli?

953
01:07:57,513 --> 01:08:00,224
- I swear there's feathers.
- I think we're going home now.

954
01:08:00,557 --> 01:08:02,685
It moved. Oh, shit.

955
01:08:17,616 --> 01:08:22,496
I'm Dr. Sully Travis. I'm here to
see Kate Travis, a patient of yours.

956
01:08:22,788 --> 01:08:24,456
You're one of her doctors?

957
01:08:25,499 --> 01:08:26,500
Yes, I am.

958
01:08:26,834 --> 01:08:29,962
Is Dr. Harper expecting you today?

959
01:08:31,797 --> 01:08:33,465
No, no. She...

960
01:08:35,009 --> 01:08:39,179
I think she'd be fine with it
though, that I see Kate.

961
01:08:42,016 --> 01:08:43,601
I'm her husband.

962
01:08:45,144 --> 01:08:46,395
To be honest...

963
01:08:46,729 --> 01:08:51,191
...I can't face another day without
seeing her. I miss her so much.

964
01:08:56,322 --> 01:08:57,990
Look.

965
01:08:58,324 --> 01:08:59,825
It's sort of like Chagall, moody.

966
01:09:00,117 --> 01:09:03,203
This is the land, this is the sky.
What's that?

967
01:09:03,537 --> 01:09:05,456
The sun? Maybe a big marshmallow?

968
01:09:05,748 --> 01:09:07,750
Look what I painted.

969
01:09:08,042 --> 01:09:10,502
No! Go away, we're playing a game.

970
01:09:11,462 --> 01:09:13,172
You keep doing that!

971
01:09:13,464 --> 01:09:15,132
Anyway, it's like Chagall.

972
01:09:15,466 --> 01:09:16,926
- Chagall?
- There's a storm.

973
01:09:17,259 --> 01:09:19,678
Where's the Chagall?
Where's the storm?

974
01:09:22,514 --> 01:09:23,807
Hi!

975
01:09:28,145 --> 01:09:30,064
Oh, God, you!

976
01:09:30,856 --> 01:09:33,442
Oh, you came!

977
01:09:34,109 --> 01:09:35,069
Oh, gosh.

978
01:09:35,361 --> 01:09:36,987
You look great.

979
01:09:38,155 --> 01:09:41,158
Look who came to see me.
Say hello to Ann, the cleaning girl.

980
01:09:41,450 --> 01:09:42,952
And Angie.

981
01:09:43,911 --> 01:09:46,455
Remember, I told you?
Well, this is...

982
01:09:46,747 --> 01:09:49,291
- Hello, I'm Alice.
- It's not Alice.

983
01:09:49,625 --> 01:09:51,460
- Bunny and...
- Katie, Katie, Katie.

984
01:09:51,794 --> 01:09:55,089
This is who I've been telling you
about. Sully, my brother.

985
01:09:55,422 --> 01:09:57,174
Oh, it's her brother!

986
01:10:03,389 --> 01:10:05,182
I have a brother. I have a brother.

987
01:10:05,516 --> 01:10:06,809
No, no. Don't sit there.

988
01:10:07,142 --> 01:10:09,645
I'm not gonna sit there,
I'm siting here.

989
01:10:16,610 --> 01:10:18,445
No, thank you.

990
01:10:25,369 --> 01:10:26,620
Kate.

991
01:10:35,921 --> 01:10:37,673
Kate, please?

992
01:10:41,135 --> 01:10:42,636
It's my heart.

993
01:10:51,103 --> 01:10:55,566
Juanita, I don't want any material
that's gonna gather by her hips.

994
01:10:55,899 --> 01:10:57,526
It's not flattering.

995
01:10:59,445 --> 01:11:00,946
It doesn't need to be taken in.

996
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:03,282
Olga, please help me out here?

997
01:11:03,616 --> 01:11:04,575
Stop smoking.

998
01:11:04,909 --> 01:11:06,827
I'm gonna smoke, Dee Dee.

999
01:11:15,210 --> 01:11:17,296
But I also want this to come down...

1000
01:11:17,630 --> 01:11:20,633
Can somebody get me
a Diet Coke, please?

1001
01:11:23,093 --> 01:11:27,514
Her breastbone is the best part of
her body, so if it could come down.

1002
01:11:30,517 --> 01:11:33,479
- Doesn't she look beautiful?
- She looks really beautiful.

1003
01:11:33,771 --> 01:11:36,023
- Get Marilyn champagne!
- I've got some.

1004
01:11:36,315 --> 01:11:37,816
- You know what?
- What?

1005
01:11:38,150 --> 01:11:41,695
I'm fine, really. Everything's
fine. The dress is fine.

1006
01:11:41,987 --> 01:11:44,323
I really wouldn't worry about
me at all, okay?

1007
01:12:03,092 --> 01:12:04,593
Hello!

1008
01:12:05,594 --> 01:12:06,804
Dad?

1009
01:12:09,014 --> 01:12:10,641
Is anybody here?

1010
01:12:17,815 --> 01:12:19,233
Where is everybody?

1011
01:12:19,525 --> 01:12:20,609
Connie?

1012
01:12:23,696 --> 01:12:27,449
Your dad said that we could
close up shop early tonight.

1013
01:12:27,783 --> 01:12:31,537
So I'm just cleaning up his desk,
which is always a mess.

1014
01:12:31,870 --> 01:12:33,414
The cleaning crew can't dust...

1015
01:12:33,747 --> 01:12:34,915
Where'd he go?

1016
01:12:37,251 --> 01:12:39,044
- Tyler.
- To go see Mom?

1017
01:12:39,378 --> 01:12:40,713
I guess.

1018
01:12:41,005 --> 01:12:43,424
When did he say
he was gonna come back?

1019
01:12:46,051 --> 01:12:49,680
I know he wanted to be back in time
for the city council meeting.

1020
01:12:50,014 --> 01:12:52,558
They're voting on the freeway thingy.

1021
01:12:52,891 --> 01:12:54,268
Probably as we speak.

1022
01:12:54,602 --> 01:12:57,438
This issue has been before
the council previously.

1023
01:12:57,771 --> 01:12:59,982
Last time it was defeated by one vote.

1024
01:13:00,316 --> 01:13:02,985
Today we represent 64 women's
organizations.

1025
01:13:03,319 --> 01:13:07,072
We trust you'll vote on behalf of
the majority of the people concerned.

1026
01:13:07,406 --> 01:13:10,743
I'd like to point out
Dr. Sullivan Travis is here with us.

1027
01:13:11,076 --> 01:13:15,080
He's a great proponent of this issue,
and willing to speak if necessary.

1028
01:13:15,414 --> 01:13:19,919
We feel it's important to save council
time, and get on with the vote.

1029
01:13:20,252 --> 01:13:21,921
Thank you, Mrs. Williamson.

1030
01:13:27,259 --> 01:13:28,761
Council, is there any discussion?

1031
01:13:29,094 --> 01:13:32,848
Yeah, I just see three names on
this agenda in front of me here.

1032
01:13:33,182 --> 01:13:35,601
Annette Strauss, Mary Kay Ash
and Jayne Mansfield.

1033
01:13:35,893 --> 01:13:38,228
You know, I need to come in
and see you this week.

1034
01:13:39,605 --> 01:13:41,190
It's really no big deal.

1035
01:13:42,024 --> 01:13:45,027
In spin class I hurt my tinker.

1036
01:13:45,486 --> 01:13:48,405
- Annette Strauss is the best candidate.
- You would.

1037
01:13:52,034 --> 01:13:55,913
Congratulations.
The Annette Strauss Memorial Parkway.

1038
01:13:56,247 --> 01:13:58,499
My God, you made a lot of women
happy today.

1039
01:13:58,832 --> 01:13:59,833
Yeah, I hope so.

1040
01:14:02,711 --> 01:14:04,088
You happy?

1041
01:14:05,714 --> 01:14:07,216
Yes, I am.

1042
01:14:11,762 --> 01:14:13,555
Do I make you happy?

1043
01:14:14,890 --> 01:14:16,433
I'm a very happy person.

1044
01:14:16,767 --> 01:14:17,726
Are you?

1045
01:14:19,228 --> 01:14:22,606
Very happy. Very, very, very happy.

1046
01:14:23,107 --> 01:14:24,733
I'm a happy man.

1047
01:14:35,286 --> 01:14:38,247
Marsha, Jenny has an insurance
problem I cannot deal with.

1048
01:14:38,539 --> 01:14:40,082
What is going on today?

1049
01:14:40,749 --> 01:14:43,502
You're not on the list.
Hang on a second.

1050
01:14:46,255 --> 01:14:47,214
It's loud!

1051
01:14:47,631 --> 01:14:50,593
Let's go to the bathroom before
Uncle Sully's office.

1052
01:14:50,884 --> 01:14:53,470
- Everybody's here!
- You look so pretty!

1053
01:14:53,846 --> 01:14:56,640
We're just gonna use the bathroom.
Go tee-tee.

1054
01:14:57,099 --> 01:14:58,851
Bye, Judy, see you a little later.

1055
01:15:01,270 --> 01:15:03,230
Well, hello!

1056
01:15:06,775 --> 01:15:08,527
- Sweet thing.
- Hey, darling.

1057
01:15:08,861 --> 01:15:10,237
Oh, honey, come on.

1058
01:15:10,571 --> 01:15:13,324
I'm sorry, sweetie. Come here, baby.
Come here.

1059
01:15:14,909 --> 01:15:16,702
Just sign in and have a seat.

1060
01:15:17,036 --> 01:15:18,787
- Has your information changed?
- No.

1061
01:15:19,121 --> 01:15:20,581
We'll be right with you.

1062
01:15:20,915 --> 01:15:23,125
Hi, Mrs. Chamblis, how are you?

1063
01:15:23,459 --> 01:15:25,586
Not well. I need to see the doctor.

1064
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:28,380
- You don't have an appointment.
- I know I don't...

1065
01:15:28,714 --> 01:15:32,468
- Dorothy, I'm so happy to see you.
- You are?

1066
01:15:32,801 --> 01:15:36,305
If you don't mind, darling,
we need another specimen.

1067
01:15:36,639 --> 01:15:39,099
- Is something wrong?
- No, no, no.

1068
01:15:39,892 --> 01:15:41,477
We spilled it.

1069
01:15:41,769 --> 01:15:42,519
You spilled it?

1070
01:15:42,978 --> 01:15:45,314
Well, I hope you didn't
ruin your shoes.

1071
01:15:45,648 --> 01:15:46,732
Mid-stream, please.

1072
01:15:49,985 --> 01:15:52,780
She looks fantastic.

1073
01:15:53,072 --> 01:15:54,615
I hated it.

1074
01:15:55,324 --> 01:15:57,576
Oh, Daddy. It's okay.

1075
01:15:58,285 --> 01:16:00,037
Connie, come here.

1076
01:16:03,332 --> 01:16:04,291
Everything is...

1077
01:16:04,583 --> 01:16:05,751
- You okay?
- I'm okay.

1078
01:16:06,085 --> 01:16:08,003
Just trying to get in the group hug.

1079
01:16:08,337 --> 01:16:10,381
I'm so happy she looks good.

1080
01:16:11,048 --> 01:16:14,134
- I got tangled up in this cape.
- You all right?

1081
01:16:21,058 --> 01:16:23,394
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

1082
01:16:24,270 --> 01:16:26,647
If you would just
calm down a little bit...

1083
01:16:26,981 --> 01:16:29,858
...your blood pressure would be
healthier, and so would ours.

1084
01:16:30,150 --> 01:16:33,112
I don't have a blood pressure problem.
Thank you very much.

1085
01:16:33,445 --> 01:16:37,157
Maybe some of this hormone
replacement therapy might help you.

1086
01:16:38,492 --> 01:16:42,162
They're unveiling the new
cheerleading calendar.

1087
01:16:42,830 --> 01:16:44,373
Really? Will you be in it?

1088
01:16:44,707 --> 01:16:46,125
I'm trying to talk to my dad!

1089
01:16:47,501 --> 01:16:49,211
I'm trying to talk for one second!

1090
01:16:50,629 --> 01:16:53,591
And anyway, they're unveiling
the calendar.

1091
01:16:53,882 --> 01:16:56,594
Well, listen.
Next year you're gonna make it.

1092
01:16:57,303 --> 01:16:59,597
You're too pretty for
everybody else now.

1093
01:16:59,888 --> 01:17:02,182
I didn't do good on the written test.

1094
01:17:02,516 --> 01:17:05,686
- There's that guy, Tom Laundry?
- Landry.

1095
01:17:06,812 --> 01:17:09,481
I know you're feeling
a little bit down.

1096
01:17:10,608 --> 01:17:12,776
Honey, give Uncle Sully
back that fetus.

1097
01:17:13,110 --> 01:17:16,155
There was that guy, Starbuck.
Roger Starbuck.

1098
01:17:18,407 --> 01:17:20,868
It's okay, I'm right here.
Here's this thing.

1099
01:17:22,745 --> 01:17:25,164
Bye, honey, I'm sorry.
Bye-bye, y'all.

1100
01:17:26,165 --> 01:17:27,416
Daddy, can l...?

1101
01:17:27,708 --> 01:17:28,876
Forget it.

1102
01:17:29,209 --> 01:17:30,586
- Bye-bye.
- We'll see you.

1103
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:32,254
Here we go, doc.

1104
01:17:32,588 --> 01:17:33,797
Oh, Lord.

1105
01:17:34,882 --> 01:17:38,302
Yeah. Okay, well,
this became a community pizza.

1106
01:17:38,636 --> 01:17:41,597
They left you half.
That was generous, huh?

1107
01:17:41,931 --> 01:17:45,017
I forgot my purse in Daddy's office.
I'll run and get it.

1108
01:17:45,351 --> 01:17:48,062
- I've got to go. I'm so late.
- I'll get it later.

1109
01:17:48,354 --> 01:17:52,399
A quiet couple of minutes by myself
for lunch. That's all I want.

1110
01:17:52,691 --> 01:17:53,609
- Thank you.
- Okay.

1111
01:17:55,945 --> 01:17:58,906
- Connie! Can I get you something?
- I forgot my purse.

1112
01:17:59,198 --> 01:18:00,658
- Can I get it?
- It's okay.

1113
01:18:00,991 --> 01:18:04,328
It's a private, a private personal
family... Thank you.

1114
01:18:07,331 --> 01:18:08,499
Hey, Dad.

1115
01:18:08,999 --> 01:18:12,169
- Can I talk to you in private?
- Sure.

1116
01:18:12,461 --> 01:18:15,005
- This is ridiculous.
- Can you work it out?

1117
01:18:15,339 --> 01:18:17,091
You better take a pill.

1118
01:18:17,424 --> 01:18:19,593
Excuse me, Bree Davis
to see Dr. Travis.

1119
01:18:19,927 --> 01:18:21,470
We're all here to see Dr. T.

1120
01:18:21,804 --> 01:18:24,640
I have an appointment,
for all the good it's done.

1121
01:18:24,974 --> 01:18:27,935
It's one of those days.
I don't see you on my list.

1122
01:18:28,269 --> 01:18:31,063
I don't have an appointment,
but he's expecting me.

1123
01:18:31,397 --> 01:18:32,731
He's with a patient now.

1124
01:18:33,065 --> 01:18:36,652
Take a seat and when he's free I'll
call him and work it out.

1125
01:18:36,986 --> 01:18:37,945
- Thanks.
- Okay.

1126
01:18:38,362 --> 01:18:42,533
I get more nervous waiting. It's the
fourth time I've tried to see him.

1127
01:18:42,866 --> 01:18:45,661
I haven't been
to a male gynaecologist in years.

1128
01:18:45,995 --> 01:18:50,082
Honey, it'll be fine. Trust me. The
man knows how to handle a speculum.

1129
01:18:50,374 --> 01:18:51,542
Dad...

1130
01:18:54,837 --> 01:18:56,714
...you can't let Dee Dee get married.

1131
01:18:57,047 --> 01:18:58,591
Why not?

1132
01:18:58,924 --> 01:19:00,426
Bart's a real nice guy.

1133
01:19:00,718 --> 01:19:02,636
He adores her, worships her.

1134
01:19:02,970 --> 01:19:06,473
I can't imagine he won't be
a really great husband to her.

1135
01:19:08,892 --> 01:19:12,521
Unless there's something about him
I should know that I don't.

1136
01:19:13,397 --> 01:19:16,525
No, but there's something you
should know about Dee Dee.

1137
01:19:16,859 --> 01:19:17,860
What is it?

1138
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:26,493
She's a lesbian.

1139
01:19:29,747 --> 01:19:30,915
What?

1140
01:19:31,248 --> 01:19:33,250
Daddy, I'm serious. She is.

1141
01:19:33,667 --> 01:19:36,712
I hate to be the one that has
to tell you this, I am...

1142
01:19:37,046 --> 01:19:40,591
...but that girl from Houston,
her so-called maid of honour...

1143
01:19:40,925 --> 01:19:41,884
...Marilyn?

1144
01:19:42,217 --> 01:19:44,845
I didn't think I was gonna have
to tell you this.

1145
01:19:45,179 --> 01:19:47,765
Remember when Dee Dee
was down at Houston...

1146
01:19:48,057 --> 01:19:50,726
...before she transferred
back up here to SMU?

1147
01:19:51,060 --> 01:19:52,603
She and Marilyn had a...

1148
01:19:54,313 --> 01:19:55,898
...you know...

1149
01:19:57,483 --> 01:19:58,651
...a thing.

1150
01:20:02,071 --> 01:20:03,322
Are you sure?

1151
01:20:03,781 --> 01:20:05,407
Dad, I'm positive.

1152
01:20:05,741 --> 01:20:09,495
Remember last year when I went to
surprise Dee Dee on her birthday?

1153
01:20:09,828 --> 01:20:11,330
I surprised her, all right.

1154
01:20:11,622 --> 01:20:14,250
Dad, I surprised all three of us.

1155
01:20:14,792 --> 01:20:18,087
I didn't say anything because
I thought she was experimenting...

1156
01:20:18,420 --> 01:20:21,382
...or trying something new
and she would do it...

1157
01:20:21,715 --> 01:20:24,093
...one or two times
and it wasn't a big deal.

1158
01:20:24,426 --> 01:20:27,179
You know, it was like a college
thing and whatever.

1159
01:20:29,014 --> 01:20:33,644
Marilyn has been up several times for
dress fittings and I can tell you...

1160
01:20:33,936 --> 01:20:35,521
...it is not over between them.

1161
01:20:35,813 --> 01:20:37,606
I don't know what to say.

1162
01:20:38,482 --> 01:20:42,736
I'm sorry, I really am. I know you've
got your own worries right now...

1163
01:20:43,070 --> 01:20:46,657
...about Mom and Peggy moving back in
with you with her kids.

1164
01:20:46,991 --> 01:20:49,952
Dr. T, the fillies are getting
a little restless.

1165
01:20:55,791 --> 01:20:56,834
Bye.

1166
01:20:59,420 --> 01:21:02,214
Anyway, I gotta get back down
to the museum.

1167
01:21:02,548 --> 01:21:05,634
More evidence came in
about the real John Wilkes Booth...

1168
01:21:05,968 --> 01:21:09,346
...hiding and living guess where?
Enid, Oklahoma until 1903.

1169
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:12,433
I know I'll get
a zillion questions today.

1170
01:21:12,766 --> 01:21:14,643
Then we can talk about Mom later.

1171
01:21:14,977 --> 01:21:19,523
And about Peggy and her kids because
they seem unhappy and disoriented.

1172
01:21:19,857 --> 01:21:21,525
Don't you think? I do.

1173
01:21:21,859 --> 01:21:25,529
More importantly, we should
definitely discuss this Marilyn thing.

1174
01:21:25,946 --> 01:21:27,031
Bye.

1175
01:21:30,242 --> 01:21:31,619
Daddy?

1176
01:21:31,952 --> 01:21:33,120
Yes?

1177
01:21:33,579 --> 01:21:38,292
Don't worry about me at all, okay?
Everything's fine with me. Really.

1178
01:21:45,716 --> 01:21:46,717
Dr. T?

1179
01:21:47,051 --> 01:21:49,595
- Dr. T, are you in there?
- Yes, I'm here.

1180
01:21:49,929 --> 01:21:53,307
There's a lady named
Bree Davis here to see you.

1181
01:21:53,641 --> 01:21:56,518
- She doesn't have an appointment.
- Lunch!

1182
01:21:57,019 --> 01:21:58,854
I heard he has a gentle touch.

1183
01:21:59,188 --> 01:22:01,649
If you ask him,
he'll use the small speculum.

1184
01:22:01,941 --> 01:22:04,777
I asked him because I hadn't had sex
in a long time...

1185
01:22:05,069 --> 01:22:06,528
Excuse me, Miss Davis?

1186
01:22:06,862 --> 01:22:08,822
Just follow me, sweetie.

1187
01:22:09,156 --> 01:22:11,992
What is that?
She's been here five minutes...

1188
01:22:12,326 --> 01:22:14,078
Tina, I'll show her back.

1189
01:22:14,411 --> 01:22:17,164
- Follow me, please.
- Whatever you say, boss.

1190
01:22:17,456 --> 01:22:18,666
I'm so sorry.

1191
01:22:18,999 --> 01:22:22,544
You wouldn't believe what's
been going on today. Come in.

1192
01:22:22,878 --> 01:22:26,674
- We've got lots of ladies.
- Thank you. I'll be right with you.

1193
01:22:26,966 --> 01:22:29,426
My God, is it always like that here?

1194
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:31,262
Always.

1195
01:22:32,179 --> 01:22:34,723
- I am so sorry.
- That's okay.

1196
01:22:35,057 --> 01:22:36,267
I don't...

1197
01:22:38,185 --> 01:22:41,272
I can't get through an hour
without thinking about you.

1198
01:22:41,563 --> 01:22:43,983
- I don't know how I forgot...
- I won't starve.

1199
01:22:44,275 --> 01:22:45,442
You want some pizza?

1200
01:22:45,734 --> 01:22:49,446
- My God, you're having a rough day.
- How'd you guess?

1201
01:22:49,780 --> 01:22:52,116
It's written all over you.
What's wrong?

1202
01:22:52,449 --> 01:22:54,034
Wrong?

1203
01:22:54,368 --> 01:22:55,578
Nothing, nothing.

1204
01:22:55,911 --> 01:22:59,164
I can tell when something's
bothering you. What is it?

1205
01:22:59,957 --> 01:23:02,126
Sit down a second, will you?

1206
01:23:08,340 --> 01:23:10,467
I just had some...

1207
01:23:11,260 --> 01:23:14,013
...weird news...

1208
01:23:14,305 --> 01:23:16,098
...from my daughter, Connie.

1209
01:23:16,390 --> 01:23:17,433
What is it?

1210
01:23:19,101 --> 01:23:22,813
Maybe I shouldn't talk about this yet.
Maybe I should let it settle.

1211
01:23:23,147 --> 01:23:25,274
Come on. Listen, you want to talk.

1212
01:23:25,608 --> 01:23:28,611
You want to get something off
your chest and I have time.

1213
01:23:28,903 --> 01:23:30,279
What is it?

1214
01:23:32,281 --> 01:23:33,824
Come on.

1215
01:23:34,199 --> 01:23:35,492
All right.

1216
01:23:35,826 --> 01:23:38,412
I don't know
how much truth there is to this.

1217
01:23:41,498 --> 01:23:44,460
Connie came here and told
me that I shouldn't...

1218
01:23:44,752 --> 01:23:48,213
...allow my other daughter,
Dee Dee, to get married...

1219
01:23:48,505 --> 01:23:50,090
...because she's a lesbian.

1220
01:23:52,343 --> 01:23:54,678
- Dee Dee's the cheerleader?
- Yeah.

1221
01:23:55,095 --> 01:23:56,055
Really?

1222
01:23:56,388 --> 01:23:59,058
Well, not necessarily is, but was.

1223
01:23:59,433 --> 01:24:00,935
I mean...

1224
01:24:02,645 --> 01:24:05,314
Christ, I don't know what I mean.

1225
01:24:08,025 --> 01:24:10,152
Well, yeah.

1226
01:24:10,486 --> 01:24:12,696
What Connie said was that...

1227
01:24:13,030 --> 01:24:16,992
...when Dee Dee was down at Houston
last year at school...

1228
01:24:17,785 --> 01:24:21,997
...she had a relationship
with this girl named Marilyn.

1229
01:24:22,289 --> 01:24:25,459
I assume she meant
sexual relationship.

1230
01:24:25,793 --> 01:24:28,796
This same Marilyn is going to be
her maid of honour.

1231
01:24:31,048 --> 01:24:35,010
Well, at least they still respected
each other the next morning.

1232
01:24:37,805 --> 01:24:40,975
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to make a joke about that.

1233
01:24:41,267 --> 01:24:44,144
- That's okay.
- Really, I'm sorry.

1234
01:24:44,478 --> 01:24:48,691
I think you might be making
a little too much of this.

1235
01:24:49,358 --> 01:24:51,193
But it is serious, isn't it?

1236
01:24:51,527 --> 01:24:53,821
This is very ser...

1237
01:24:54,154 --> 01:24:56,532
She's getting married. I mean, l...

1238
01:24:57,825 --> 01:24:59,535
I just don't know what she...

1239
01:24:59,827 --> 01:25:01,245
I want her to be happy.

1240
01:25:01,954 --> 01:25:06,166
You know what? This is the first time
I've ever seen you look so scared.

1241
01:25:06,917 --> 01:25:09,128
- What are you scared of?
- I don't know.

1242
01:25:09,461 --> 01:25:11,005
I don't know.

1243
01:25:11,297 --> 01:25:12,881
You want my opinion?

1244
01:25:14,091 --> 01:25:15,593
Yeah.

1245
01:25:16,969 --> 01:25:19,555
Do you remember when we first met
what you said?

1246
01:25:19,888 --> 01:25:20,848
No, what?

1247
01:25:21,181 --> 01:25:24,560
You said that every woman
is special in her own way.

1248
01:25:24,893 --> 01:25:28,314
That there's no two alike.
So if that's true...

1249
01:25:28,606 --> 01:25:32,693
...then Dee Dee is Dee Dee.
Let her be who she is.

1250
01:25:33,027 --> 01:25:37,907
If she loves this guy and wants to get
married, who cares what she did with...

1251
01:25:38,240 --> 01:25:39,992
- What is her name?
- Marilyn.

1252
01:25:40,284 --> 01:25:41,285
Who cares?

1253
01:25:41,619 --> 01:25:43,579
Judy, I'm not feeling very well.

1254
01:25:43,913 --> 01:25:46,707
- I'm getting that hot feeling.
- Get some water.

1255
01:25:47,041 --> 01:25:49,084
- Take a deep breath.
- My throat's dry...

1256
01:25:50,044 --> 01:25:51,712
No, please don't. Please go...

1257
01:25:52,254 --> 01:25:53,255
I'm so sorry.

1258
01:25:53,589 --> 01:25:56,508
- But you know...
- Thank you. Give us a minute.

1259
01:25:56,926 --> 01:25:59,178
We have so very many
people out there.

1260
01:25:59,470 --> 01:26:01,722
- Could you give us...
- Women people, Dr. T.

1261
01:26:02,056 --> 01:26:05,017
Thanks very much, I'll be out.
I'll be right out.

1262
01:26:09,855 --> 01:26:11,982
I got a really good idea.

1263
01:26:12,316 --> 01:26:15,527
Why don't you and I
just get together tonight after work.

1264
01:26:16,946 --> 01:26:20,282
We'll find a nice romantic
restaurant somewhere.

1265
01:26:20,616 --> 01:26:23,619
Is that good for you?
Because it would be good for me.

1266
01:26:23,953 --> 01:26:27,748
I would love that, but I can't.
I'm going out of town for a few days.

1267
01:26:28,040 --> 01:26:29,667
- My plane leaves at five.
- Where?

1268
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,502
New Orleans.

1269
01:26:32,294 --> 01:26:35,089
It's a golf thing.
I'm going with a friend.

1270
01:26:35,422 --> 01:26:39,218
Listen, your office is going crazy
out there, so I'm gonna go.

1271
01:26:39,551 --> 01:26:41,512
I'll call you as soon as I get back.

1272
01:26:43,180 --> 01:26:45,683
Where are you staying?
I can call the hotel.

1273
01:26:45,975 --> 01:26:47,351
At least say good night.

1274
01:26:47,643 --> 01:26:50,229
I don't know where I'll be.
My friend arranged it.

1275
01:26:50,729 --> 01:26:52,481
I'll call you. Don't worry.

1276
01:26:52,815 --> 01:26:54,650
I'll be back before you know it.

1277
01:26:55,442 --> 01:26:56,402
Bye.

1278
01:26:56,735 --> 01:26:58,654
I wish you would please take a seat.

1279
01:26:59,572 --> 01:27:03,200
I've waited here long enough.
I feel it's time for me to get in.

1280
01:27:04,410 --> 01:27:07,538
Dr. T, I'm sorry. I know
you've got a lot going on.

1281
01:27:07,997 --> 01:27:11,125
I don't want to tell you
what's going on in waiting room.

1282
01:27:11,417 --> 01:27:13,669
But we'll never get out of here
tonight...

1283
01:27:13,961 --> 01:27:14,920
Who've we got?

1284
01:27:15,254 --> 01:27:17,923
Good. We've got Melinda Jones...

1285
01:27:18,257 --> 01:27:21,135
...pregnancy follow-up
in Phyllis George.

1286
01:27:21,468 --> 01:27:25,764
Hildy's back. Guess the amoxicillin
didn't work. She's in Ann Richards.

1287
01:27:26,098 --> 01:27:28,892
And we have a new one.
Oh, she's really something.

1288
01:27:29,226 --> 01:27:33,355
Dr. T? It's your lawyer, Sam Levy.
He says it's important. Can you talk?

1289
01:27:33,689 --> 01:27:35,733
All right, put him through.

1290
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:38,485
She's in Belle Starr.

1291
01:27:38,819 --> 01:27:40,112
Sam, what is it?

1292
01:27:40,446 --> 01:27:43,991
Sully, I got some bad news.
I hope you're sitting down.

1293
01:27:44,325 --> 01:27:46,368
Kate wants a divorce.

1294
01:27:47,620 --> 01:27:48,871
Sam.

1295
01:27:54,043 --> 01:27:57,004
She said I could have her appointment.
Let me in.

1296
01:27:57,296 --> 01:28:00,174
I can't just see you
when you just walk in here.

1297
01:28:00,507 --> 01:28:03,761
- She's such an idiot, really.
- I don't have to take this.

1298
01:28:05,095 --> 01:28:07,014
What are you looking at?

1299
01:28:07,973 --> 01:28:09,934
- Happy?
- It has nothing to do with it.

1300
01:28:10,267 --> 01:28:13,479
Could you sit down and wait?
I'm getting Dr. Travis.

1301
01:28:14,021 --> 01:28:17,149
I'm sorry, there is absolutely
no smoking whatsoever!

1302
01:28:17,691 --> 01:28:20,486
I don't know what to say.
Could you call me later?

1303
01:28:20,819 --> 01:28:23,072
Sam, please? Do me a favour.

1304
01:28:23,447 --> 01:28:25,658
Oh, Dr. T, I'm so sorry...

1305
01:28:25,991 --> 01:28:27,451
Sorry for the interruption...

1306
01:28:27,785 --> 01:28:30,246
...but we've got a situation.
Dorothy Chamblis.

1307
01:28:30,704 --> 01:28:31,830
Jesus!

1308
01:28:32,164 --> 01:28:35,751
- She's locked herself in the bathroom.
- I'll handle this, Dr. T.

1309
01:28:39,380 --> 01:28:41,298
Everybody has gone crazy.

1310
01:28:54,520 --> 01:28:56,021
You ready?

1311
01:28:58,232 --> 01:29:00,609
All right.
Ready or not, here we come.

1312
01:29:02,736 --> 01:29:06,073
- Hi, there. I'm Dr. Travis.
- Hello.

1313
01:29:06,407 --> 01:29:11,036
Congratulations. First timers don't
usually get the Belle Starr room.

1314
01:29:11,453 --> 01:29:13,330
I feel honoured.

1315
01:29:13,914 --> 01:29:16,458
So who's Belle Starr?

1316
01:29:17,001 --> 01:29:18,877
- Not from Dallas, are you?
- No.

1317
01:29:19,211 --> 01:29:20,212
No. Marilyn.

1318
01:29:21,714 --> 01:29:24,466
So what have we got?
Vaginal infection?

1319
01:29:24,758 --> 01:29:27,386
Why don't we have a look?
See what's going on.

1320
01:29:27,678 --> 01:29:30,848
Gonna be very gentle.
Nothing to worry about here.

1321
01:29:31,724 --> 01:29:35,311
So, you don't know
who Belle Starr is?

1322
01:29:35,603 --> 01:29:37,438
Well, Belle Starr...

1323
01:29:37,771 --> 01:29:40,232
...is a Dallas legend. Alrighty.

1324
01:29:40,566 --> 01:29:42,318
Yeah, she was a wild thing.

1325
01:29:44,361 --> 01:29:45,529
There you go.

1326
01:29:45,863 --> 01:29:47,531
Thank you.

1327
01:29:47,990 --> 01:29:51,327
I can't believe Dr. T would allow
a bitch like that in here.

1328
01:29:51,660 --> 01:29:53,287
He plays golf with her husband.

1329
01:29:53,621 --> 01:29:54,872
Gives Dallas a bad name.

1330
01:29:55,205 --> 01:29:56,790
I heard that, bitch!

1331
01:29:59,335 --> 01:30:00,586
Oh, dear!

1332
01:30:00,920 --> 01:30:02,379
Oh, my goodness!

1333
01:30:04,131 --> 01:30:06,133
- Excuse me, ladies.
- Ladies, back up.

1334
01:30:06,467 --> 01:30:07,468
Give her some air!

1335
01:30:07,843 --> 01:30:09,261
Okay, touching my leg.

1336
01:30:09,595 --> 01:30:12,306
Okay, I'll be entering you now.
Take it easy.

1337
01:30:12,598 --> 01:30:13,682
Where are you from?

1338
01:30:15,184 --> 01:30:19,104
I'm originally from Connecticut
but I've been living in Houston.

1339
01:30:19,730 --> 01:30:21,732
Houston. Alrighty.

1340
01:30:22,483 --> 01:30:24,068
So what brings you to Dallas?

1341
01:30:24,401 --> 01:30:29,240
I'm here for a bridesmaid fitting
for Dee Dee's wedding.

1342
01:30:30,574 --> 01:30:31,867
- Doctor?
- I'm her...

1343
01:30:32,201 --> 01:30:34,161
I'm her maid of honour, Marilyn.

1344
01:30:34,495 --> 01:30:38,582
I think I've got a yeast infection.
Probably from all the wedding stress.

1345
01:30:40,125 --> 01:30:41,126
Yes?

1346
01:30:41,460 --> 01:30:43,337
I'm sorry, but we have a situation.

1347
01:30:43,671 --> 01:30:45,214
No, come in. Come in here.

1348
01:30:45,547 --> 01:30:47,007
Come in, Carolyn.

1349
01:30:47,341 --> 01:30:50,928
Well, it's Dorothy.
As soon as you can, it'd be real good.

1350
01:30:51,220 --> 01:30:53,722
- Yes, I'll be right there.
- Thank you so much.

1351
01:30:54,056 --> 01:30:55,933
Yes. No, I will.

1352
01:30:59,228 --> 01:31:02,481
Tina could you take...
I think we do have...

1353
01:31:02,773 --> 01:31:04,692
...yeast.
- That's what I thought.

1354
01:31:05,067 --> 01:31:08,571
Could you do the smear for me, please?
I appreciate that.

1355
01:31:08,904 --> 01:31:11,782
I'll... Thank you.
Thank you very much.

1356
01:31:13,409 --> 01:31:15,744
Let's move back
and give her some air.

1357
01:31:16,078 --> 01:31:17,788
Get back! Give her some air!

1358
01:31:21,542 --> 01:31:23,586
Move back, everything's fine.

1359
01:31:24,295 --> 01:31:25,671
Move around, move around.

1360
01:31:25,963 --> 01:31:28,048
I've got it. Tell me what happened.

1361
01:31:28,382 --> 01:31:29,925
She fell and hit her head.

1362
01:31:30,217 --> 01:31:31,760
You called paramedics?

1363
01:31:32,094 --> 01:31:34,096
Can you open your eyes, Dorothy?

1364
01:31:34,388 --> 01:31:37,641
She's fine.
Ladies, quiet, move back now.

1365
01:31:59,246 --> 01:32:01,749
- Don't touch your head.
- I see.

1366
01:32:02,082 --> 01:32:04,126
Not now. Oh, her purse.

1367
01:32:04,460 --> 01:32:07,338
Just because Dr. T plays golf...

1368
01:32:07,838 --> 01:32:11,675
It's gonna be okay, Mrs. Chamblis.

1369
01:32:11,967 --> 01:32:13,510
Oh, throw up in your purse.

1370
01:32:14,303 --> 01:32:16,263
- In your purse.
- I come from wealth.

1371
01:32:16,597 --> 01:32:17,598
I know you do.

1372
01:32:18,140 --> 01:32:19,975
Very wealthy.

1373
01:32:22,811 --> 01:32:24,480
I think he knows, Dee Dee.

1374
01:32:24,813 --> 01:32:27,066
- Who?
- Your dad.

1375
01:32:27,650 --> 01:32:31,237
- Knows what?
- You know, knows about us.

1376
01:32:31,695 --> 01:32:34,907
- Knows what about us?
- Knows about our relationship...

1377
01:32:35,241 --> 01:32:37,534
...or ex-relationship, whatever it is.

1378
01:32:37,868 --> 01:32:42,498
Well, what makes you think he knows
about all that?

1379
01:32:42,831 --> 01:32:45,042
I don't know. I could just tell.

1380
01:32:46,126 --> 01:32:48,754
How? By the way he examined you?

1381
01:32:49,046 --> 01:32:53,759
No, he just acted real nervous
after I told him who I was.

1382
01:32:54,260 --> 01:32:57,554
It seemed like, you know,
hard for him...

1383
01:32:57,888 --> 01:33:00,015
...to look at me down there.

1384
01:33:01,225 --> 01:33:05,563
You're just being paranoid.
There's no way he could find out.

1385
01:33:05,896 --> 01:33:08,274
Only people who know are you and me.

1386
01:33:09,316 --> 01:33:10,526
And Connie.

1387
01:33:10,818 --> 01:33:13,571
- Connie won't say anything.
- Right.

1388
01:33:15,573 --> 01:33:18,617
I just don't know about
being up here in Dallas...

1389
01:33:18,951 --> 01:33:21,412
...and doing this
whole wedding thing...

1390
01:33:21,745 --> 01:33:23,998
It just doesn't feel right.

1391
01:33:26,417 --> 01:33:28,377
And I'm starting to feel...

1392
01:33:29,378 --> 01:33:30,421
...like a...

1393
01:33:31,338 --> 01:33:35,175
- Like what, honey?
- Like a bridesmaid.

1394
01:33:36,176 --> 01:33:38,637
Don't cry. You'll make me cry.

1395
01:33:38,971 --> 01:33:42,975
Honey, you're not a bridesmaid.
You're so much more than that.

1396
01:33:43,309 --> 01:33:45,895
I mean, you are my girl.

1397
01:33:48,647 --> 01:33:50,065
- Dr. T?
- Yes?

1398
01:33:50,357 --> 01:33:52,776
I'm locking up. Do you need anything?

1399
01:33:53,110 --> 01:33:55,404
- No. I'm fine.
- Okay then.

1400
01:33:55,696 --> 01:33:56,655
Bye.

1401
01:34:03,329 --> 01:34:05,706
Carolyn!
I thought you'd gone already.

1402
01:34:06,040 --> 01:34:06,999
I was locking up.

1403
01:34:07,333 --> 01:34:10,711
I wanted to clean my contacts
before I drove home. I can lock up.

1404
01:34:11,045 --> 01:34:12,212
- Want me to wait?
- No...

1405
01:34:12,546 --> 01:34:15,090
...I need to work on my lens,
I got a smudge.

1406
01:34:15,382 --> 01:34:17,593
It's fine, bye.
I'll see you tomorrow.

1407
01:34:32,316 --> 01:34:33,275
Hey, handsome.

1408
01:34:35,569 --> 01:34:38,322
Carolyn, what are you...
I thought everyone left?

1409
01:34:38,614 --> 01:34:41,575
Oh, come on. You know me.

1410
01:34:41,909 --> 01:34:44,078
I'll always find something to do.

1411
01:34:45,913 --> 01:34:50,251
So, hey, how would you like
a nice massage?

1412
01:34:50,584 --> 01:34:53,170
Come on, you need it.
It's no problem for me.

1413
01:34:53,504 --> 01:34:56,840
Lord Almighty, you've had
a heck of a day, haven't you?

1414
01:34:57,174 --> 01:35:00,761
I'm so sorry everything
was so difficult for you today.

1415
01:35:06,558 --> 01:35:07,977
How's that?

1416
01:35:10,229 --> 01:35:14,275
- Right there.
- Ooh, yeah, big ol' lump.

1417
01:35:19,613 --> 01:35:21,824
- Easing up.
- That's good.

1418
01:35:27,830 --> 01:35:29,957
I don't know what I'd do
without you...

1419
01:35:31,041 --> 01:35:32,251
...Carolyn.

1420
01:35:42,636 --> 01:35:45,055
That's the sweetest thing
I've ever heard.

1421
01:35:45,973 --> 01:35:50,644
Because, you know, Dr. T,
there's nothing that I wouldn't...

1422
01:35:50,978 --> 01:35:54,189
...do for you.
There's nothing I wouldn't do.

1423
01:35:54,523 --> 01:35:56,734
And you don't ever
have to worry about...

1424
01:35:57,067 --> 01:36:00,821
...what you'd do without me.
You don't ever have to worry.

1425
01:36:01,155 --> 01:36:05,200
Because I'm just gonna
be here for you. You know?

1426
01:36:05,492 --> 01:36:08,579
So that's all there is to that.
And, Dr. T...

1427
01:36:08,913 --> 01:36:13,125
...if you don't mind my saying,
you do need a wife.

1428
01:36:13,459 --> 01:36:16,712
You do need a wife.
You need a real good wife...

1429
01:36:17,046 --> 01:36:21,258
...who's as good to you as you are
to so many other people.

1430
01:36:21,592 --> 01:36:25,220
You treat people so special
and you care about them.

1431
01:36:25,554 --> 01:36:30,517
You need a wife who cares about you.
And who adores you.

1432
01:36:32,144 --> 01:36:34,980
You need somebody
to make you feel good.

1433
01:36:35,272 --> 01:36:39,860
I just know that there's a really
special woman out there...

1434
01:36:40,194 --> 01:36:42,154
...who'd be so good to you...

1435
01:36:42,488 --> 01:36:45,699
...who'd make your life complete.

1436
01:36:46,033 --> 01:36:48,994
And you would
make each other so happy.

1437
01:36:53,332 --> 01:36:55,417
- That's better. Thank you.
- No!

1438
01:36:55,709 --> 01:36:57,211
- That's really good.
- Oh.

1439
01:36:57,503 --> 01:37:00,673
You really are special.
You're always there for me.

1440
01:37:00,965 --> 01:37:03,592
Loyal, loyal person.

1441
01:37:06,595 --> 01:37:08,681
I'll see you tomorrow.

1442
01:37:14,103 --> 01:37:15,020
Carolyn?

1443
01:37:15,354 --> 01:37:16,313
Yes?

1444
01:37:17,523 --> 01:37:19,233
What are you doing down there?

1445
01:37:21,193 --> 01:37:23,445
You never do clean your wastebasket.

1446
01:37:23,779 --> 01:37:26,115
So I'm doing that.
I'll see you tomorrow.

1447
01:37:35,583 --> 01:37:37,001
Oh, my God.

1448
01:37:59,815 --> 01:38:01,442
You know, I don't get it.

1449
01:38:02,818 --> 01:38:07,072
Two weeks ago there were enough turkeys
to spit and have dinner for 50.

1450
01:38:10,659 --> 01:38:13,370
I think we ought to try
some of that ridge.

1451
01:38:13,662 --> 01:38:15,831
Down that bottom.
What do you think?

1452
01:38:17,666 --> 01:38:20,794
- We should try the ridge...
- No, don't be antsy.

1453
01:38:21,128 --> 01:38:23,172
Just sit here.

1454
01:38:25,716 --> 01:38:27,009
Be patient.

1455
01:38:27,968 --> 01:38:30,596
Dorothy got her head bandage off
yesterday.

1456
01:38:30,930 --> 01:38:32,890
Yeah. That's good.

1457
01:38:33,223 --> 01:38:36,227
- She didn't have a concussion.
- No, she'll be fine.

1458
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:37,895
Fourteen stitches.

1459
01:38:39,063 --> 01:38:40,022
She'll be fine.

1460
01:38:41,440 --> 01:38:44,443
She's gonna want to find
another gynaecologist.

1461
01:38:44,860 --> 01:38:47,446
Whatever she wants.
That's probably best.

1462
01:38:47,988 --> 01:38:51,116
But you and me can still
hunt together.

1463
01:38:51,450 --> 01:38:54,870
I mean, nothing's changed
between you and me. Besides...

1464
01:38:55,621 --> 01:38:57,081
...she doesn't need to know.

1465
01:39:02,878 --> 01:39:05,172
- What the hell happened?
- Misfire?

1466
01:39:05,464 --> 01:39:09,677
- Must have been a bad shell.
- No shell. Damn.

1467
01:39:11,387 --> 01:39:12,221
You know what?

1468
01:39:12,888 --> 01:39:17,268
We ought to have a boys' weekend.
Just the four of us.

1469
01:39:18,018 --> 01:39:22,106
- Go someplace different, maybe...
- Sully's got the wedding this weekend.

1470
01:39:22,439 --> 01:39:26,443
Just the four of us.
We can go to Vegas...

1471
01:39:26,735 --> 01:39:29,280
...New Orleans.
I just got back from there.

1472
01:39:29,613 --> 01:39:33,117
That is a great city. Oh, yeah.

1473
01:39:33,742 --> 01:39:35,619
Sexy city, New Orleans.

1474
01:40:05,608 --> 01:40:09,069
Hi, Carolyn. Where were you?
Why are you so late?

1475
01:40:09,361 --> 01:40:11,030
- You look pretty.
- Thank you.

1476
01:40:14,241 --> 01:40:16,493
Better get started,
looks like a storm.

1477
01:40:16,827 --> 01:40:19,204
I prayed for this weather
at my wedding.

1478
01:40:21,123 --> 01:40:23,208
Hey, look who's here, there he is.

1479
01:40:23,542 --> 01:40:25,419
- Sully.
- All gussied up.

1480
01:40:26,670 --> 01:40:29,214
So, Kate, congratulations.

1481
01:40:30,424 --> 01:40:33,385
- Thank you.
- You looking lovely.

1482
01:40:34,094 --> 01:40:35,220
A flower!

1483
01:40:35,512 --> 01:40:39,183
- You're gaining an in-law.
- Think we better get to our seats now.

1484
01:40:39,475 --> 01:40:43,938
I hope you know, we're only here
out of respect for Kate. Joanne.

1485
01:40:44,271 --> 01:40:46,732
- Gonna need an enema.
- Congratulations, Sully.

1486
01:40:48,234 --> 01:40:49,860
Are you coming?

1487
01:40:54,698 --> 01:40:55,991
Dr. T.

1488
01:40:56,283 --> 01:40:58,827
Come on, we're ready for you.

1489
01:41:06,043 --> 01:41:09,964
Flowers are perfect, your wife's
in her seat, so everything's great.

1490
01:41:10,464 --> 01:41:12,383
- Okay, you ready?
- Yes.

1491
01:41:15,344 --> 01:41:19,098
- Don't take anything else off.
- All right.

1492
01:41:26,939 --> 01:41:30,276
- She's pretty, really.
- Hi. Hi, Mom!

1493
01:41:31,068 --> 01:41:34,488
I'm way behind now.
Oh, I'm way behind now.

1494
01:41:35,573 --> 01:41:36,991
Hi!

1495
01:41:37,700 --> 01:41:39,910
Good. Little nervous.

1496
01:41:40,244 --> 01:41:45,040
I'm nervous. Hey, Kate!
Hey, baby girl, you look so beautiful!

1497
01:41:45,332 --> 01:41:47,626
You see? She's a bridesmaid.
All the girls in...

1498
01:41:47,960 --> 01:41:50,087
No, she's getting divorced.

1499
01:41:56,760 --> 01:41:58,470
This weather is horrible.

1500
01:42:00,055 --> 01:42:01,807
Oh, God. This is not good.

1501
01:42:09,231 --> 01:42:10,608
- Can I have some?
- Sure!

1502
01:42:10,941 --> 01:42:12,943
Thank you! Thank you!

1503
01:43:08,832 --> 01:43:10,209
I love you.

1504
01:43:28,477 --> 01:43:30,479
Oh, honey!

1505
01:43:30,771 --> 01:43:32,606
I love you so much, baby.

1506
01:43:32,940 --> 01:43:34,108
I do.

1507
01:43:46,620 --> 01:43:48,414
Daddy, I'm sorry. I'm so happy.

1508
01:43:48,747 --> 01:43:49,957
I'll be all right.

1509
01:43:50,291 --> 01:43:53,168
Just be happy. I love you!

1510
01:43:54,169 --> 01:43:56,130
- It's okay.
- What just happened?

1511
01:43:56,463 --> 01:43:58,591
I think she doesn't feel good...

1512
01:43:58,882 --> 01:44:00,843
...because she's sick.

1513
01:44:01,135 --> 01:44:02,344
Mom!

1514
01:44:02,928 --> 01:44:05,556
Be careful, it's lightning!
Get her out of there!

1515
01:44:05,889 --> 01:44:07,057
Dr. T?

1516
01:44:07,391 --> 01:44:10,060
You know that I have
great affection for you.

1517
01:44:10,352 --> 01:44:11,520
Great affection.

1518
01:44:11,812 --> 01:44:14,023
But I always wanted to be
a pastry chef.

1519
01:44:14,356 --> 01:44:17,109
So I'm quitting my job. Bye-bye.

1520
01:44:21,655 --> 01:44:22,823
Dad...

1521
01:44:23,157 --> 01:44:26,952
...don't worry about me, okay?
Because I'm gonna be fine, okay?

1522
01:44:43,594 --> 01:44:45,596
Kate! Come and get the...

1523
01:44:45,930 --> 01:44:49,058
Will you go in and get her out?

1524
01:44:51,227 --> 01:44:54,271
Well, just take your shoes off.

1525
01:45:36,730 --> 01:45:38,190
My keys!

1526
01:46:33,662 --> 01:46:35,623
Come on in, it's open!

1527
01:46:36,123 --> 01:46:37,291
Bree?

1528
01:46:40,002 --> 01:46:41,170
Bree?

1529
01:46:42,546 --> 01:46:43,756
Bree?

1530
01:46:44,131 --> 01:46:46,133
Sully.

1531
01:46:46,467 --> 01:46:48,886
- What are you doing here?
- Bree, I want...

1532
01:46:49,219 --> 01:46:51,055
I want you to run away with me!

1533
01:46:53,182 --> 01:46:54,433
What?

1534
01:46:54,767 --> 01:46:58,145
I want you to run away with me!

1535
01:46:58,479 --> 01:46:59,855
Oh, my God, you're wet.

1536
01:47:00,189 --> 01:47:01,899
I am wet. I love you.

1537
01:47:02,191 --> 01:47:04,860
I want you. I need you.

1538
01:47:05,194 --> 01:47:09,782
I can't take all this craziness
in my life anymore. These women are...

1539
01:47:10,115 --> 01:47:12,534
Look, I just want you.

1540
01:47:12,826 --> 01:47:14,620
I want to go away, you and me.

1541
01:47:14,954 --> 01:47:16,622
I want you to come downstairs...

1542
01:47:16,956 --> 01:47:19,458
...and catch your breath.
I'll make you tea.

1543
01:47:19,792 --> 01:47:22,544
I'm serious, Bree. Bree, I'm serious.

1544
01:47:22,878 --> 01:47:24,463
I've never been...

1545
01:47:24,797 --> 01:47:27,132
...so serious in all my life.

1546
01:47:28,259 --> 01:47:29,885
I want to go away...

1547
01:47:30,219 --> 01:47:31,512
...with you.

1548
01:47:32,930 --> 01:47:35,474
I want to spend the rest of my life
with you.

1549
01:47:36,684 --> 01:47:38,769
You're different. You're just...

1550
01:47:39,520 --> 01:47:42,690
...different than any woman
I've ever known. Ever.

1551
01:47:43,023 --> 01:47:45,484
I want to be together,
just you and me.

1552
01:47:45,818 --> 01:47:48,529
I want us to get out of here,
as far as we can.

1553
01:47:48,862 --> 01:47:50,573
So come on! Let's just go!

1554
01:47:50,906 --> 01:47:52,157
Let's go! Come on.

1555
01:47:52,449 --> 01:47:55,411
Get in the car and get out of here.
Right this minute!

1556
01:47:55,744 --> 01:47:57,663
Let's just see where it takes us.

1557
01:47:59,123 --> 01:48:00,291
Come on, Bree.

1558
01:48:00,583 --> 01:48:01,792
What do you say?

1559
01:48:02,126 --> 01:48:03,961
I'm sorry. I can't do that.

1560
01:48:06,380 --> 01:48:08,007
I can't go away with you.

1561
01:48:10,009 --> 01:48:11,969
Why not? I love you.

1562
01:48:13,053 --> 01:48:14,680
I need you.

1563
01:48:16,682 --> 01:48:18,058
We can be together.

1564
01:48:18,392 --> 01:48:21,186
You won't have to work,
or give golf lessons...

1565
01:48:21,520 --> 01:48:24,064
...or do anything else
you don't want to do.

1566
01:48:24,940 --> 01:48:26,483
I could take care of you.

1567
01:48:26,817 --> 01:48:29,695
Totally. You'll never
have to worry again.

1568
01:48:29,987 --> 01:48:32,072
Why would I want that?

1569
01:48:50,215 --> 01:48:51,592
New Orleans.

1570
01:48:52,676 --> 01:48:56,013
I can't go to New Orleans with you.
I just got back, remember?

1571
01:48:57,348 --> 01:48:58,682
I know.

1572
01:49:00,017 --> 01:49:02,144
Plus, I made plans.

1573
01:49:06,899 --> 01:49:08,234
Are you with Harlan?

1574
01:49:09,985 --> 01:49:11,904
I'm not with anybody.

1575
01:54:51,035 --> 01:54:52,453
Telephone?

1576
01:55:15,768 --> 01:55:17,061
What's her name?

1577
01:55:18,062 --> 01:55:20,189
Does anyone speak English here?

1578
01:55:23,275 --> 01:55:25,027
Consuela. Agua.
Water.

1579
01:55:26,487 --> 01:55:28,739
You'll be fine. Be fine.

1580
01:55:30,115 --> 01:55:31,200
Push.

1581
01:55:32,034 --> 01:55:32,910
Push.

1582
01:55:37,748 --> 01:55:38,958
All right.

1583
01:55:43,837 --> 01:55:45,631
All right, Consuela.

1584
01:55:47,258 --> 01:55:48,968
All right, now push.

1585
01:55:49,552 --> 01:55:51,303
You're doing good.

1586
01:55:51,637 --> 01:55:53,764
Push now. Push.

1587
01:56:04,066 --> 01:56:06,694
Yes, come on now. A little more.

1588
01:56:10,197 --> 01:56:12,324
Yes! All right, here it comes.

1589
01:56:12,658 --> 01:56:15,869
You're doing real good. Yes! Yes!

1590
01:56:23,836 --> 01:56:25,671
Good. Good. Good.

1591
01:56:43,439 --> 01:56:44,648
It's a boy.

1592
01:56:47,610 --> 01:56:49,653
It's a boy!

1593
01:56:55,534 --> 01:56:56,994
It's a beautiful boy.
