1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,419
Second, you know I'd never do anything
to injure you.

2
00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:05,714
You know I'd never do anything
to hurt my opinion of myself.

3
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:10,844
If the beret bothers you, it bothers me.
If it upsets you, it upsets me.

4
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:27,069
How did you enjoy shopping today?

5
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:30,072
Wait until you see what I got.

6
00:00:32,074 --> 00:00:35,244
I got it because the saleslady
said it's one of a kind.

7
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:38,914
I'll never find another like it.
I know it's silly...

8
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:41,458
...but I only got it for you.

9
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:47,548
Honey, I wouldn't want the kids
to see me in something like this.

10
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:53,929
Sparky, it's our first night in Paris.
Let's do something romantic.

11
00:00:54,263 --> 00:00:57,432
- I'm taking you out to dinner.
- "Out"?

12
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:00,477
I felt like staying in.

13
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:04,273
I thought it would be really nice
to be alone.

14
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,988
I'd never go anywhere without you.

15
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,950
Cheer up.
I promised you a night on the town.

16
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:17,369
We'll see some French culture.
You'll love it.

17
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:57,618
Down with the feet, hip distance apart...

18
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,204
...stomachs pulled in, buttocks tight.

19
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,664
Let's start with head rolls.

20
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:06,543
To the right and back and left and forward.

21
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:20,557
Isn't this great?

22
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:25,229
They've done this for eons in France.
This is real culture.

23
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:30,067
Exhale and raise your arms over your head.
Reach with the right...

24
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:33,237
Clark, could I have the coat check?

25
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:36,907
I think I've had enough French culture
for one evening.

26
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:44,540
- Look.
- I am looking.

27
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:46,250
Back there.

28
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:53,757
- It's just a hooker. They're everywhere.
- Look who she is with.

29
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:11,191
Russell Griswald.

30
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:14,152
Oink, oink, my good man.

31
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,947
- How did you get in?
- I paid.

32
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,992
- I'm surprised at you.
- I'm surprised at you, Dad.

33
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,410
Don't talk back.

34
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,954
- Who was that cheap slut?
- Cherie's not a slut.

35
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,664
I'm disappointed in you.

36
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:28,250
Who said, "When in Rome,
do as the Romans do"?

37
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:31,420
I said Rome, not Paris.
This is Paris, and you're drunk.

38
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:40,679
Hold it!

39
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:08,999
Let me have it!

40
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:10,959
Today is my turn.

41
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:12,961
- Give them to me.
- No!

42
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:18,800
Look what you did to them.

43
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:23,639
They're mine!
How many times do I have to tell you that?

44
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,778
Will you slow down?
The kids are exhausted.

45
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:41,740
It closes in 15 minutes.
There are 100,000 works of art to see.

46
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:48,664
Great. Are you happy, Dad? She's dead.

47
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:17,359
I'm proud of you guys.

48
00:05:17,693 --> 00:05:21,113
We've seen everything in Paris,
and we're on schedule.

49
00:05:21,864 --> 00:05:24,908
Can't we slow down a little bit?
I'm exhausted.

50
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,036
We'll have a relaxing time
with my relatives in Germany.

51
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:37,713
Enjoying Paris?

52
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:41,466
Have you seen the Louvre yet?

53
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:43,719
Not yet.

54
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,721
The Left Bank is charming.

55
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,098
We plan to go there.

56
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:51,810
- Been up the Eiffel Tower yet?
- No, but it's on our list.

57
00:05:53,437 --> 00:05:55,063
Have a good time.

58
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,402
What a waste. We've seen 10 times
as much as they have.

59
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:06,450
Hi, sweetie. You want some breakfast?

60
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:08,619
I'm not hungry.

61
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:12,581
He's got his hands on her tits
right at the table.

62
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:14,750
Stop staring.

63
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:19,588
European standards of public behavior
are different than ours.

64
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,548
But they're from Akron.

65
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:26,762
Audrey, I've missed the shit out of you.

66
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:29,431
Luckily, Debbie came by to cheer me up.

67
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:32,809
- That bitch!
- Something the matter, Audrey?

68
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:37,648
It's time we asked ourselves
this question:

69
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,610
Is this relationship strong enough
for us to consider seeing other people?

70
00:06:41,944 --> 00:06:43,612
I think it is.

71
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:48,659
Pass the croissants, please.
And the butter and jelly.

72
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:51,328
I'm glad your appetite's back.

73
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,539
Who have I got to be thin for?

74
00:07:00,838 --> 00:07:02,339
He's going to pork her.

75
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:06,009
He isn't going to pork her. Now eat.

76
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:07,427
I think he is.

77
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:10,764
He may pork her. Just eat, okay?

78
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:55,851
There it is, kids.

79
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,103
My motherland.

80
00:07:59,897 --> 00:08:02,191
Dad, Grandma's from Chicago.

81
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:03,567
Shut up, Russ.

82
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:17,372
I can't wait to meet our relatives,
in person.

83
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:20,792
Dipplestrabe.

84
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:23,212
What are we looking for?

85
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:25,839
- Sechs.
- That will do, Audrey.

86
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:28,133
That's German for "six. "

87
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:31,220
Is that true?

88
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:52,574
My family and I are looking for sechs.

89
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:57,287
There's number six.

90
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:10,968
Fritz, Clark Griswald. Good to see you.

91
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:14,137
Remember Ellen from her letters?
There she is.

92
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:18,934
And Rusty and Audrey.
They've gotten bigger since the pictures.

93
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:22,729
Sorry we're late. I went to
the wrong door. Thanks for the invitation.

94
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:36,326
This must be the German dining room.
Isn't it nice?

95
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:39,830
Clark, it's just as I imagined.

96
00:09:40,998 --> 00:09:42,583
It's so quaint.

97
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:45,169
Yeah, maximum quaintness.

98
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:49,339
You must be Helga. We made it.

99
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,634
You know Ellen, my wife,
and Rusty and Audrey.

100
00:09:55,971 --> 00:09:58,849
Let me help you in the kitchen.
Come on, kids.

101
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:01,643
Go help in the kitchen. Help Helga out.

102
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:05,564
So, Fritz, how you been?

103
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:07,482
Long time never seen.

104
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:29,922
Here's your cousin Al.
He's a hotshot lawyer.

105
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:32,549
They'll probably get him on tax evasion.

106
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:34,259
Here's the baby.

107
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:38,180
You don't believe that cock-and-bull story
about the baby being premature?

108
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,600
I didn't think so.

109
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:47,022
When me and Jack got together,
we'd been seeing other people.

110
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:51,109
But this is different, because Debbie
is my best friend, don't you think?

111
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,530
God, it's so good
to have someone to talk to.

112
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:59,409
I tell my parents stuff but they don't seem
to know what I'm talking about.

113
00:11:00,077 --> 00:11:02,663
- What are you talking about?
- You see?

114
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:07,459
God, I miss Jack.

115
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:22,474
I was just thinking.
Blood really is thicker than water.

116
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:28,063
It's amazing how family ties
break through language barriers.

117
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:31,400
This has been my favorite part of the trip.

118
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:40,117
Dad, look. Bedpans.

119
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:45,330
You've been so sweet. Here's our address.

120
00:11:45,664 --> 00:11:48,834
When you come to Chicago,
come stay with us.

121
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:55,174
Thanks for the marvelous conversation.

122
00:11:56,884 --> 00:11:58,468
We'll write.

123
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:19,364
A festival.

124
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:22,534
It looks like fun. Come on, kids.

125
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,798
- What's your name?
- Claudia. And yours?

126
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:20,133
- I'm Rusty.
- Hello.

127
00:13:25,681 --> 00:13:27,349
Do you ever get to leave here?

128
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:35,649
What's so funny? This is great, isn't it?

129
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,609
I love these.

130
00:13:37,693 --> 00:13:39,987
Who wants bratwurst, mustard and relish?

131
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:06,638
Holy shit!

132
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:09,600
Hey, you! Come on!

133
00:14:10,142 --> 00:14:13,562
Very good. We need one more.
A big strong man.

134
00:14:15,314 --> 00:14:18,483
Hey, you! Come on!
Come on, don't be afraid.

135
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:34,082
I don't know if I can do that.

136
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:36,168
Just follow the others.

137
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,439
Isn't he great?

138
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:07,069
- Those bells haven't rung in years.
- What does it mean?

139
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:09,071
They're going to hang somebody!

140
00:17:10,489 --> 00:17:11,823
Dad.

141
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:25,671
Hurry up!

142
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:13,218
Oh, shit.

143
00:18:17,681 --> 00:18:20,392
- It's too narrow!
- There's plenty of room.

144
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:22,227
I know this car.

145
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:28,734
Get out! There goes the paint job.

146
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:11,527
Why the sour puss?

147
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:16,455
You ruined what could have been
the best day of my life.

148
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:20,369
What are you complaining about?
I lost my boyfriend thanks to this vacation.

149
00:19:20,744 --> 00:19:24,540
- I vote we stop talking about Jack.
- I vote for that.

150
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:27,543
I vote we don't talk
about schedules anymore.

151
00:19:27,668 --> 00:19:28,627
Me, too.

152
00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:29,878
I'm for that.

153
00:19:30,379 --> 00:19:34,800
I vote we don't talk at all until we get
to Rome and everybody calms down.

154
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:38,470
Maybe then we can act
like mature human beings.

155
00:21:43,762 --> 00:21:47,599
Clark, I thought we'd talk.
What are we doing?

156
00:21:47,933 --> 00:21:52,604
We're going to a travelers checks place
to get our money refunded.

157
00:21:52,688 --> 00:21:54,982
We'll rent a new car, buy some clothes...

158
00:21:55,274 --> 00:21:58,819
...and finish the best goddamn vacation
of our lives.

159
00:21:59,069 --> 00:22:00,279
Let's go.

160
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,993
I think Dad's lost all sense of reality.

161
00:22:15,961 --> 00:22:17,880
Let's get out of here.

162
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:22,009
What are we going to do with him?
Kill him?

163
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:24,803
Don't be stupid. We never kill anyone.

164
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:26,763
Then, what do we do?

165
00:22:29,349 --> 00:22:31,351
I've got a better idea.

166
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:33,312
We can hold him for ransom.

167
00:22:34,229 --> 00:22:35,814
He must be worth something.

168
00:22:38,984 --> 00:22:41,987
Clark! I think this is something historical.

169
00:22:42,321 --> 00:22:44,698
It looks real old, Dad.

170
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:48,619
That's great. We'll see it later.

171
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:51,163
Only four more miles. Let's go.

172
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:58,003
What we need now is a dupe.
Someone above suspicion...

173
00:22:58,504 --> 00:23:00,964
...who will believe anything you tell him.

174
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:03,759
A real idiot.

175
00:23:03,842 --> 00:23:05,511
Anybody here?

176
00:23:07,012 --> 00:23:10,182
We have no proof
we lost the travelers checks.

177
00:23:10,307 --> 00:23:12,100
We left the stubs in the suitcase.

178
00:23:15,062 --> 00:23:16,230
Can I help you?

179
00:23:16,522 --> 00:23:19,858
I'm Clark W. Griswald. We're
the grand prize Pig in a Poke winners.

180
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:26,073
We're in a bind. We lost our luggage,
a videotape camera, rented car...

181
00:23:26,156 --> 00:23:30,369
...and $1,000 in cash.
So, I'm just here to get my money back.

182
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:34,581
I certainly hate to see
our customers inconvenienced.

183
00:23:43,131 --> 00:23:46,301
- Name?
- Clark W. Griswald.

184
00:23:50,639 --> 00:23:52,307
Ellen Griswald.

185
00:23:57,062 --> 00:24:00,232
These are our children, Rusty and Audrey.

186
00:24:00,399 --> 00:24:02,192
Come over here. Show yourselves.

187
00:24:07,447 --> 00:24:08,907
Here we are.

188
00:24:15,122 --> 00:24:19,084
Excuse me. We lost only $1,000.
This is $3,000.

189
00:24:19,293 --> 00:24:21,128
That's to make up for your trouble.

190
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,632
I lost about $200.

191
00:24:29,636 --> 00:24:32,097
Stay quiet. We'll get you out later.

192
00:24:34,433 --> 00:24:38,604
Unfortunately, we somehow
misplaced the key to the trunk.

193
00:24:39,104 --> 00:24:42,858
If you tell me where you're staying,
we'll send the key there.

194
00:24:43,609 --> 00:24:45,819
At what hotel are we staying?

195
00:24:46,069 --> 00:24:48,030
- The Nazionale.
- Very nice.

196
00:24:49,281 --> 00:24:51,658
I didn't know you rented cars.

197
00:24:55,954 --> 00:24:58,248
I'll see you, then.

198
00:25:00,167 --> 00:25:02,294
Let's see some Roman ruins.

199
00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:06,340
We've been in these clothes for ages.
Let's go shopping.

200
00:25:06,757 --> 00:25:08,008
I vote for shopping.

201
00:25:08,258 --> 00:25:10,177
I feel totally scuzzed out.

202
00:25:10,344 --> 00:25:15,182
We'd all look good in some Italian fashions.
Got plenty of money.

203
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,169
- You look cool.
- I feel cool.

204
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:13,509
Looking good, Mom!

205
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:17,137
Let's go. We ready to conquer Rome?

206
00:27:33,028 --> 00:27:35,322
I'll be back and we'll hit the fountains.

207
00:27:44,122 --> 00:27:46,792
I'm terribly sorry. Are you all right?

208
00:27:47,793 --> 00:27:49,670
No problem at all.

209
00:27:49,753 --> 00:27:51,463
It's you. The guy from London.

210
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:53,298
You're the American I ran into.

211
00:27:55,509 --> 00:27:57,010
What are you doing in Rome?

212
00:27:57,678 --> 00:28:00,848
On sick leave. A little holiday. Recovering.

213
00:28:01,014 --> 00:28:02,808
Still on holiday with the kids?

214
00:28:02,891 --> 00:28:05,978
Yeah, we're here.
We've just been out shopping.

215
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,063
Nice choice.

216
00:28:08,313 --> 00:28:10,899
They're right there.
Kids, look who it is! Say "hi"!

217
00:28:14,528 --> 00:28:16,613
You've got a cast on your leg.

218
00:28:16,989 --> 00:28:21,160
This? Think nothing of it.
Hardly matters at all.

219
00:28:21,368 --> 00:28:22,911
It's just a big sock, really.

220
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:28,333
That's pretty nice of you. I feel bad.
At least, let me give you a hand.

221
00:28:28,542 --> 00:28:29,710
No, thanks!

222
00:28:30,169 --> 00:28:31,503
Isn't this your hotel?

223
00:28:31,628 --> 00:28:34,798
No, my hotel's over there.
Have a nice holiday.

224
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,550
Okay. Cheerio!

225
00:28:38,844 --> 00:28:40,762
This is the Piazza Navona.

226
00:28:41,013 --> 00:28:41,889
Jack?

227
00:28:44,892 --> 00:28:48,437
It's one of the most fabulous squares
in Rome. What's wrong?

228
00:28:48,812 --> 00:28:51,023
I want to go home. I miss Jack.

229
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:54,693
We have a few more fountains to see,
then the Colosseum.

230
00:28:54,776 --> 00:28:57,779
I don't want to see the Colosseum.
I want to see Jack!

231
00:28:58,363 --> 00:28:59,823
Jack will always be there.

232
00:28:59,948 --> 00:29:03,619
The Colosseum will always be there.
It's been there 2,000 years.

233
00:29:03,827 --> 00:29:08,123
If I don't go home soon, Jack will fall
in love with Debbie, and I'll die.

234
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:12,544
Don't you want to see the Colosseum
before you die?

235
00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:14,546
I hate you.

236
00:29:15,714 --> 00:29:17,758
I'll meet you later at the hotel.

237
00:29:18,884 --> 00:29:20,511
What about the fountains?

238
00:29:20,677 --> 00:29:22,387
I'm fountained out.

239
00:29:22,471 --> 00:29:24,139
Clark, let him go.

240
00:29:24,598 --> 00:29:27,017
We're leaving in two days.

241
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:29,937
These are our last moments together
as a family.

242
00:29:30,729 --> 00:29:34,733
Dad, we've been together every second
for the last two weeks!

243
00:29:35,609 --> 00:29:39,530
By the way, I've been good.
I haven't complained or tried to escape.

244
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:42,282
Why can't you treat me like a man,
for once?

245
00:29:43,742 --> 00:29:45,202
Because you're not a man.

246
00:29:45,619 --> 00:29:49,414
I am, too!
I'm 15 years old, a world traveler.

247
00:29:49,498 --> 00:29:52,543
I have a part-time job.
I need my independence.

248
00:29:53,252 --> 00:29:55,254
If he's going, I'm going.

249
00:29:55,379 --> 00:29:58,048
Why don't we give the kids
some free time?

250
00:29:58,924 --> 00:30:02,261
Sure. Let them go.
They're just a couple of ingrates.

251
00:30:02,427 --> 00:30:04,930
They're not ingrates, they're teenagers.

252
00:30:05,138 --> 00:30:07,349
- Where's my allowance?
- Where's my passport?

253
00:30:07,432 --> 00:30:09,560
Just a minute!

254
00:30:09,977 --> 00:30:12,229
Let's settle down and be reasonable.

255
00:30:12,521 --> 00:30:16,441
If we think about it,
we can all make some compromises.

256
00:30:22,614 --> 00:30:24,449
Oh, my God!

257
00:30:30,622 --> 00:30:32,499
- Take it easy.
- I don't believe this!

258
00:30:32,624 --> 00:30:36,587
This is the most humiliating thing you've
ever done to me! This is the last straw.

259
00:30:36,837 --> 00:30:39,339
It's not my fault they stole the camera.

260
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:41,758
You promised to erase it!

261
00:30:42,301 --> 00:30:45,929
I was going to erase it.
The guy stole the camera.

262
00:30:46,013 --> 00:30:48,974
This is the lowest, the worst, Clark!

263
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:53,770
Where are you going?
We're going to the Colosseum at 2:00.

264
00:30:53,854 --> 00:30:55,689
I'm going back to the hotel!

265
00:30:57,399 --> 00:30:58,824
We didn't vote on that.

266
00:30:58,859 --> 00:31:01,570
Forget your vote!
I'm seceding from the Union...

267
00:31:01,612 --> 00:31:05,157
...forming my own government,
and declaring war on you!

268
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:13,290
- She knows I didn't do it on purpose.
- I don't blame her.

269
00:31:14,917 --> 00:31:17,169
Yeah, it's not even a good likeness, is it?

270
00:31:20,672 --> 00:31:22,591
I guess it's just you and me, Audrey.

271
00:31:30,057 --> 00:31:31,517
Buongiorno.

272
00:31:35,229 --> 00:31:37,439
That's bellissimo.

273
00:31:38,023 --> 00:31:39,483
Really choice?

274
00:31:40,484 --> 00:31:45,697
And I think that
you are really bellissimo also.

275
00:31:46,907 --> 00:31:48,909
You're not too shabby yourself.

276
00:31:49,409 --> 00:31:52,120
- You speak English?
- I'm from California.

277
00:31:52,371 --> 00:31:54,331
All right! I'm from Chicago.

278
00:31:56,917 --> 00:31:59,461
Do you want to go scarf
some grimace proportions?

279
00:32:00,712 --> 00:32:02,381
What are you doing in Rome?

280
00:32:02,714 --> 00:32:04,383
Traveling with my folks.

281
00:32:04,633 --> 00:32:05,968
Me, too. We won...

282
00:32:06,009 --> 00:32:09,513
- Pig in a Poke. I saw the show.
- You saw the show?

283
00:32:09,721 --> 00:32:13,183
You answered the Thomas Edison
question and won car wax.

284
00:32:13,433 --> 00:32:15,853
- You remembered?
- Yes, I thought you were cute.

285
00:32:16,436 --> 00:32:18,230
You thought I was cute?

286
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:34,079
Finally, there's one of them.

287
00:32:34,329 --> 00:32:35,581
And she's alone.

288
00:32:35,914 --> 00:32:37,916
Let's get the guy out of the trunk.

289
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:41,253
Too many people here.
We'll move the car first.

290
00:32:41,628 --> 00:32:43,422
I'll get the keys from her.

291
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:21,960
I hate to see a beautiful woman
drink bad wine.

292
00:33:22,961 --> 00:33:27,299
Then you should leave,
because I'm going to get plastered.

293
00:33:29,301 --> 00:33:30,677
What is it?

294
00:33:32,179 --> 00:33:33,764
Is it your husband?

295
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,724
That pig?

296
00:33:35,974 --> 00:33:37,809
He's not a pig.

297
00:33:44,983 --> 00:33:47,444
He is a pig. He is!

298
00:33:52,699 --> 00:33:54,034
Thank you.

299
00:33:56,662 --> 00:33:59,540
Operator, I'd like the number
for information.

300
00:33:59,832 --> 00:34:01,834
I want to call the airport.

301
00:34:06,964 --> 00:34:09,299
Numero, please-o.

302
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,012
Pan Am.

303
00:34:22,563 --> 00:34:25,232
Va bene. Non si preoccupi.
Faccio io. Lasci stare.

304
00:34:25,983 --> 00:34:29,820
È stata una disgrazia.
Ora rimedio io, piano piano.

305
00:34:30,237 --> 00:34:31,029
Che fa?

306
00:34:58,891 --> 00:35:02,060
Then I rolled on the floor
and started going...

307
00:35:05,939 --> 00:35:09,776
I was completely naked.
Not completely, I had on a towel.

308
00:35:10,068 --> 00:35:14,573
He promised me he'd erase that.
He promised me he'd erase it.

309
00:35:15,449 --> 00:35:17,409
I'm a ruined woman.

310
00:35:18,911 --> 00:35:21,079
I thought this was going to be...

311
00:35:23,081 --> 00:35:25,751
...like some kind of second honeymoon.

312
00:35:26,752 --> 00:35:30,923
We should have left the children
with Helga and Fritz.

313
00:35:34,968 --> 00:35:38,263
I'm sorry, but I should go to my room now.

314
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:40,599
I'm going to throw up.

315
00:35:45,521 --> 00:35:47,022
Let me help you.

316
00:35:47,314 --> 00:35:49,942
No, no. I'll be fine, really.

317
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:53,070
I think you'll feel better if you lie down.

318
00:35:55,489 --> 00:35:58,283
I have a philosophy
about dealing with my parents.

319
00:35:58,659 --> 00:36:01,620
If I'm in school or hanging out
or something...

320
00:36:01,829 --> 00:36:05,999
...there's all this pressure
to act cool or do the right thing.

321
00:36:06,667 --> 00:36:09,294
But if I'm with my parents,
who really cares?

322
00:36:09,503 --> 00:36:13,131
They don't know what's cool and what's
not, so I just put everything on hold.

323
00:36:14,049 --> 00:36:16,218
That's a great way to look at it.

324
00:36:17,803 --> 00:36:19,471
I'm having a great time.

325
00:36:19,847 --> 00:36:20,889
Me, too.

326
00:36:21,348 --> 00:36:25,310
Imagine coming all the way to Rome
to meet someone from California.

327
00:36:30,148 --> 00:36:32,484
Whatever happened to us?

328
00:36:33,652 --> 00:36:35,654
We were high school sweethearts.

329
00:36:35,821 --> 00:36:40,492
We never even did it until we got married.
Well, at least until we decided to.

330
00:36:40,993 --> 00:36:43,954
And I left him all alone in that piazza.

331
00:36:44,329 --> 00:36:47,207
I said the "F" word in front of my children!

332
00:36:47,499 --> 00:36:50,002
What kind of woman am I?

333
00:36:51,003 --> 00:36:51,879
Exciting.

334
00:36:53,338 --> 00:36:55,048
Don't fight it, Ellen.

335
00:36:55,549 --> 00:36:57,509
What are you doing?

336
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:00,012
Let me take you away from this.

337
00:37:00,137 --> 00:37:03,348
I don't want to be away.
I want my Sparky back.

338
00:37:04,683 --> 00:37:07,603
It was just a little argument.
He'll be here any minute.

339
00:37:08,228 --> 00:37:09,521
He's very jealous.

340
00:37:10,898 --> 00:37:12,274
I'm calling the manager.

341
00:37:13,901 --> 00:37:16,361
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

342
00:37:25,913 --> 00:37:28,248
Are you taking any calls?

343
00:37:31,168 --> 00:37:33,754
The police are here.
Stay away from the Fiat.

344
00:37:34,087 --> 00:37:35,088
I'm leaving.

345
00:37:35,172 --> 00:37:36,840
I'll be right down.

346
00:37:37,799 --> 00:37:39,593
Debbie, Audrey!

347
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,221
We've got a score to settle,
and you know what I mean!

348
00:37:42,554 --> 00:37:47,392
If you want to salvage our last shred
of friendship, do me this favor.

349
00:37:47,893 --> 00:37:52,397
I want you to book me on a Pan Am
flight out of Rome into Chicago today!

350
00:37:53,899 --> 00:37:55,609
Yeah, I'll hold.

351
00:37:58,654 --> 00:37:59,530
Bitch.

352
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:08,580
Take the car keys!

353
00:38:10,082 --> 00:38:11,708
Find your father!

354
00:38:16,296 --> 00:38:17,589
Don't move.

355
00:38:30,769 --> 00:38:32,771
Mom, where are you going?

356
00:38:36,692 --> 00:38:39,611
- What's wrong?
- Mom's been kidnapped.

357
00:38:41,613 --> 00:38:44,074
- Where's the car?
- Over there. Here's the keys.

358
00:39:10,517 --> 00:39:11,560
There they are!

359
00:39:35,334 --> 00:39:37,669
Hey, Dad, there's the Colosseum!

360
00:39:44,968 --> 00:39:48,680
I've talked so much. What about you?
What are your parents like?

361
00:39:49,389 --> 00:39:52,184
There's really not that much to say.

362
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:54,228
They're just normal parents.

363
00:40:04,238 --> 00:40:06,824
My Dad's all right.
He's a little slow sometimes.

364
00:40:14,748 --> 00:40:16,333
God, that's Dad!

365
00:40:18,126 --> 00:40:21,421
- What happened?
- Not much. Mom's been kidnapped.

366
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:47,823
Darn it all!

367
00:40:55,789 --> 00:40:58,584
Excuse me. There's a man in the trunk.

368
00:41:06,967 --> 00:41:08,427
I'm coming!

369
00:41:40,792 --> 00:41:42,669
Take my hand!

370
00:41:48,634 --> 00:41:50,802
Clark, where are you going?

371
00:41:51,178 --> 00:41:52,971
Get back here!

372
00:42:21,834 --> 00:42:23,001
You bastard!

373
00:42:24,878 --> 00:42:26,171
Come here.

374
00:42:33,136 --> 00:42:34,429
Still on holiday?

375
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,849
Sorry. I'm looking for someone else.

376
00:42:37,057 --> 00:42:39,643
No problem. I'm used to it. Good luck!

377
00:42:49,736 --> 00:42:51,071
He kidnapped my wife.

378
00:42:53,699 --> 00:42:55,033
You all right?

379
00:43:12,384 --> 00:43:15,220
I love you, Sparky. You're my hero.

380
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:16,638
I know.

381
00:43:17,389 --> 00:43:20,058
Your parents are actually pretty cool.

382
00:43:20,392 --> 00:43:23,562
Yeah, they're good
for a few laughs, sometimes.

383
00:43:24,563 --> 00:43:26,899
Now can we go home?

384
00:44:17,783 --> 00:44:19,159
Look.

385
00:44:21,453 --> 00:44:23,330
The Statue of Liberty.

386
00:44:25,499 --> 00:44:28,627
I never thought I'd be so glad
to see the Statue of Liberty.

387
00:44:28,669 --> 00:44:29,670
Me neither.

388
00:44:30,629 --> 00:44:35,133
The great thing about traveling
is you really appreciate coming home.

389
00:44:41,473 --> 00:44:42,850
I've got to go.

390
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,150
I never realized
how much I've missed America.

391
00:44:51,984 --> 00:44:54,486
I bet America's missed the Griswalds.

392
00:44:58,198 --> 00:45:01,869
I'm very sorry. Let me get...
My jacket is caught.

393
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,299
Yup. The Griswalds are back!
