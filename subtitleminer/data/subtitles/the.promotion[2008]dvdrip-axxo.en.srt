<i>Hi. I'm Doug Stauber.</i>

2
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:21,650
<i>I'm an assistant manager
at Donaldson's Grocery...</i>

3
00:00:21,721 --> 00:00:24,622
<i>where customers come first-
even customers who are nuts.</i>

4
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:27,956
- Mr. Stauber.
- Can I help you?

5
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:32,055
<i>This guy had some complaint
about the cracker Teddy Grahams...</i>

6
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:34,066
<i>a honey graham snack.</i>

7
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:36,659
<i>- Okay.
- He spoke some other kind of language.</i>

8
00:00:36,736 --> 00:00:39,569
<i>"Lerhman torsh."</i>

9
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,139
That's not Spanish, bro.
I don't know what that is.

10
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,248
Okay, "Lerhman."
Let's go. Sorry.

11
00:00:59,692 --> 00:01:01,626
Oh, no.

12
00:01:01,694 --> 00:01:03,525
Lerhman, man,
I don't know, Lerhman. I don't-

13
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:06,565
<i>- Holy shit!
- At Donaldson's...</i>

14
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:09,761
<i>the assistant manager
deals with customer complaints.</i>

15
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:13,972
<i>What the hell?</i>

16
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,508
<i>It's my job to keep a lid on this place.</i>

17
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:20,376
<i>It's kind of hard.
I mean, it's not like I have a crack staff.</i>

18
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:27,643
<i>Outside, we have a gang problem.
And we have two 14-year-old security guards...</i>

19
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,520
<i>who stand as far away from the store
as they possibly can.</i>

20
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:34,458
<i>And at the end of the day,
I get reviews from customers...</i>

21
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:36,620
<i>whose feedback is important to us.</i>

22
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:39,688
<i>I returned to the lot
from the grocery and found three black guys...</i>

23
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,893
<i>sitting on my car eating snacks.</i>

24
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:45,870
<i>They finally left,
but called me names and words like "tasty"...</i>

25
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,567
<i>and "lick"and "titties."</i>

26
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:52,407
<i>I have to turn these cards
over to our actual manager...</i>

27
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,243
<i>who's usually on his way back
from a movie.</i>

28
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:57,044
- What's up?
- Hey.

29
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,948
- New cards?
- Yeah.

30
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:01,009
Good ones?

31
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:06,685
That's good.
"Lick." "Titties."

32
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:09,091
I'm gonna take off.

33
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:12,359
<i>So my job has challenges.</i>

34
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:14,423
<i>So I'm not smiling here
because I'm actually happy.</i>

35
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:16,435
<i>I'm smiling because
I'm pretty sure my manager-</i>

36
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:19,028
<i>who probably is actually happy-
expected me to...</i>

37
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:21,539
<i>and I want to advance
and have a good career.</i>

38
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:23,940
I'm supporting the orbital bone
with my right hand...

39
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,638
and the other hand
is right in her chest cavity, you know?

40
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:30,274
I'm manually massaging her heart now.
I thought she was going to die.

41
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:33,046
- How'd you get her back?
- Instinct.

42
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:36,714
- Hey, Jen.
- Hey, Doug. You remember Mark Timms.

43
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:38,222
<i>- Yeah. Hi.
- Hi.</i>

44
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:42,193
We were just talking about how Mark
saved a two-year-old girl's life.

45
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:44,196
Good job.

46
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:46,994
- Oh. Tell Mark about "Teddy Grahams."
- That's all right.

47
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:48,556
<i>- It's hilarious.
- What?</i>

48
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:51,798
- This Teddy Grahams "snack slap" thing.
- Oh, snack slap?

49
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:54,601
- He got in this little slap fight.
- What happened? Tell me.

50
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,642
- Tell him.
- That's ok- No.

51
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:59,803
No, come on, man.
I want to know. Come on, guy.

52
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:03,371
<i>And I'm asked to share my
graham cracker slap stories with my wife's boss...</i>

53
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:06,509
<i>- who never remembers my name.
- All right.</i>

54
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:09,248
<i>And my name's on my shirt. Right side.</i>

55
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:13,418
<i>Just the first name though. I tried to put
"Mr. Stauber"on it, but I got reprimanded.</i>

56
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:19,025
Big deal. He saved an infant.
That's great.

57
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:21,524
- If I had infant
-saving training, I could probably do it.

58
00:03:21,525 --> 00:03:21,726
Okay.

59
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:26,397
<i>Some days,
I didn't think anyone would call me "mister."</i>

60
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:30,272
<i>I'd just be "Doug"...for good.</i>

61
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:53,761
You're a shoo-in, dude.

62
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:56,267
<i>- Seriously?
- Seriously.</i>

63
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:59,635
Hey, do you know where the expression
"shoo-in" comes from?

64
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:01,799
No.

65
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:05,002
<i>The Romans used to-</i>

66
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:09,045
I'm the shoo-in- the leading shoo-in.
Totally.

67
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:11,208
<i>- Oh, you're the leading shoo-in.
- Yeah, totally.</i>

68
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:14,151
Come here, you sweaty bastard.
You sweaty shoo-in.

69
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,280
- I'm really sweaty.
- I don't care. Come here.

70
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:20,053
Oh, Jesus! You stink.

71
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:23,118
- I'll take a shower.
- It's okay.

72
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:40,842
Hey, guy, can you just give us a break?
One night?

73
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:43,108
<i>My partner's coming over.</i>

74
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:46,549
<i>- I'm supposed to have this piece prepared.
- Man, we're trying to...</i>

75
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,883
<i>have dinner.</i>

76
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,185
<i>I thought you were makin' out. "A II sweaty."</i>

77
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:55,984
<i>Compromise. I'll do scales.</i>

78
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,733
- Is it still for sale?
- Yeah.

79
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:06,863
<i>We should go get that house. This week.</i>

80
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:09,737
Because I'm gonna get that job,
and I feel really good about things.

81
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:13,438
Me too.
Maybe we should wait though.

82
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:18,576
I'm a shoo-in. And someone's
gonna snag that house. Let's do it.

83
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:21,415
- Shoo-in?
- Yeah.

84
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:25,116
All right. Let's do it.

85
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:28,558
<i>It was right there, what we worked for.</i>

86
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:31,831
<i>Then this guy
comes down from Canada.</i>

87
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:35,626
<i>#Every day I'm gonna strut that stuff#</i>

88
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:38,694
<i># When the music's loud

89
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:41,740

00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:46,768

<i># Spread the news

<i># Come on, feet

102
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:49,936
<i>- # Hey, yeah ##
- Got the loading dock right over there.</i>

103
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:52,102
<i>- That's for blue stock only.
- Okay.</i>

104
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:54,646
<i>- That gets logged in right away.
- Blue stock.</i>

105
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:57,808
<i>And if it's before 8:15 in the morning,
you've got to do it.</i>

106
00:06:57,884 --> 00:07:00,148
<i>- Move it over right up there to that first pallet.
- Right.</i>

107
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:03,552
This way, as soon as it goes back,
it's rotated back to the first-

108
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:11,458
<i>We just moved.
My wife was transferred, so now I'm here.</i>

109
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:14,967
Richard Wehlner, from Quebec.

110
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:17,025
<i>And that's pretty much where it all started-</i>

111
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,697
<i>some joker blowing down
from Canada...</i>

112
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:22,741
<i>from a sister company
I didn't even know we had.</i>

113
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:37,645
Nice location.

114
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:41,592
Yeah.

115
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:43,822
<i>- It's a Plus?
- What's that?</i>

116
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:46,763
<i>- It's gonna be full size?
- Full size.</i>

117
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:50,132
This place will draw too.
There's not another grocery till Western.

118
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:53,172
I'm gonna put in for it,
full manager.

119
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:55,434
Yeah, me too.

120
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:03,004
- So, okay. See you later.
- Yep. See you later.

121
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,176
Eh, gimme five.

122
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,594
<i>Erickson's is our sister company.</i>

123
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,569
Okay.

124
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:29,130
Yeah, they're all over Canada.
Wehlner's got, like, six years in up there.

125
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,142
But I'm still the shoo-in, right?

126
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:35,010
I don't know.
Wehlner's kind of a wild card.

127
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:38,175
His work history transfers clean, so-

128
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:41,584
I don't know about
this shoo-in business.

129
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:45,112
So there's a microchip on the right
anterior wheel that has a sensor in it...

130
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:48,922
<i>and if it detects an obstacle,
it will engage the self-braking mechanism.</i>

131
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:52,260
<i>So no more scratched door small claims, right?</i>

132
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:54,322
All right, here we go.

133
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:05,309
<i>I had to tell her I wasn't a shoo-in...</i>

134
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,903
<i>- and that maybe the house was out for now.
- Whoa!</i>

135
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,914
<i>That's no way to play the banjo.</i>

136
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:12,780
<i>- I'm doing the best I can.
- No, you're not. Because you don't love me.</i>

137
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:15,252
<i>- I love you intensely.
- Then show me...</i>

138
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:17,846
<i>- by playing better banjo.
- Okay.</i>

139
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:20,893
<i>Then show me... sexually.</i>

140
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,053
Dream or real?

141
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:27,622
- Real.
- Oh, my God.

142
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,634
<i>Chapter Two.</i>

143
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:32,170
<i>We'll learn the importance
of recognizing opportunities...</i>

144
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:35,833
<i>to stand out at work
and to steer clear of trouble.</i>

145
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:38,706
We'll also learn that success
does not come to the timid...

146
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:41,872
<i>but to those like-
Richard Wehlner-</i>

147
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:43,882

271
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:34,245

with a couple of other guys as a formality.

272
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:36,583
They don't stand a chance really.

273
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:40,056
Not with you in this suit,
they don't.

274
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:43,769
Is that guy still standingon

275
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:44,289
Yeah.

276

<i>Our grocery-
We have Martin's projects right there.</i>

301
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:41,143
And we're trying to draw
from pretty high-end neighborhoods.

302
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:46,344
We get a lot of cut-throughs, but, uh,
keeping the lot safe is our number one obstacle.

303
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:48,978
And I don't shy away
from the lot. It's critical.

304
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:52,512
<i>That's good. It's critical
at the Augusta Plus store too.</i>

305
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:54,718
<i>We have public housing right there.</i>

306
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:59,321
Yeah, it's a balancing act. You need safety,
but you also need good community relations.

307
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:01,798
I'm glad you mentioned
community relations.

308
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:06,600
The housing- those are our neighbors,
our customers too.

309
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:09,334
It's important to get along.

310
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:13,503
Doug, what's this?

311
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:18,746
<i>- I grabbed this on the 19th.
- That's out of line.</i>

312
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:20,648
Yeah.

313
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:26,419
- When did you get that?
- June 19th, at your deli, on the refrigeration unit.

314
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:31,656
<i>- I think this is B.S.
- It is B.S.</i>

315
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,995
I was probably on lot that day.
I like it out there.

316
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,627
Who was inside?

317
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:42,936
Maybe... Richard?

318
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:49,309
- Richard Wehlner.
- Yeah. Mmm.

319
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:53,442
I think so. Yep.

320
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:57,682
<i>You think he was on Deli,
or he was on Deli?</i>

321
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:01,325
Was on Deli.

322
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:05,796
Send him in.

323
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:13,702
<i>Doug, these aren't great.</i>

324
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:18,869
Bear down. We'll get some fresh cards.
We'll take it from there.

325
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,037
I like what you're saying.

326
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:24,173
I need to like what you're doing
a little more.

327
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:26,183
Thank you.

328
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:33,052
- How'd it go?
- Good.

329
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:39,195
<i>Hello, gentlemen.</i>

330
00:21:39,264 --> 00:21:42,097
<i>I'm Richard Wehlner.
Thank you for your valuable time.</i>

331
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:44,465
Nice to meet you, sir.
Richard Wehlner.

332
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:48,097
Hi. How do you do?
Thank you for your valuable time.

333
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:03,243
In Canada, we don't say-

334
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:12,629
"Cutting the cheese" simply means
cutting the actual cheese.

335
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:16,862
<i>It doesn't have a double thing,
so I just missed it.</i>

336
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:22,105
Because in Canada, it's "cracking."

337
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:27,544
- The expression.
- It's "cracking" in Canada. Yeah.

338
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:31,104
We "crack the cheese."

339
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:43,150
"Cracking it"?

340
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:49,434
"Cracking the cheese"?

341
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:53,663
So I simply really believed
that Rogelio...

342
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:56,333
had been given
an intra-Deli award...

343
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:58,808
for cutting the actual cheese.

344
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,072
I'm sorry.

345
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:20,924
I simply believed Rogelio
had been given an intra-Deli-

346
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:24,958
<i>I heard you the first time.
Listen. We have permit delays.</i>

347
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:28,972
We're on hold this month.
We won't be deciding for a few weeks.

348
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,702
Make up the ground.

349
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:34,041
<i>- Okay?
- Okay.</i>

350
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:35,977
Then that's all.

351
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:38,345
Well, thank you for gimme-

352
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:42,319
for giving me your valuable time.

353
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:50,455
Thank you for your time. I appreciate it.
Thank you, sir, for your time.

354
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:52,793
Thank you for this- for this moment.

355
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:56,300
Thank you very much, Mr. Cranston.
Appreciate it.

356
00:23:56,368 --> 00:24:00,498
Thank you very much, sir, for your time today.
You are a valuable person to me.

357
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:04,201
And I am sorry
about this cutting business.

358
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,210
That's the end of that.

359
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,803
No more cheese business.

360
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:15,919
<i>Last stop, financial district.</i>

361
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:25,428
<i>So I never got to go over my cool
bullet points because of the fart gag joke.</i>

362
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:28,364
The whole board saw it.
It was uncool.

363
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:30,833
Why don't you
forget about it for now?

364
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:34,338
<i>I want you to blow off some steam.
I have an idea.</i>

365
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:37,398
I signed us up for dance lessons.

366
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,876
- Oh, I don't know.
- Let's go for it.

367
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:43,540
- Let's do salsa. It's so beautiful.
- Not when I do it.

368
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:46,675
It's gonna be,
because you're a beautiful guy.

369
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:54,956
I don't know if I can do it.
Here, sweetie. Ready?

370
00:24:58,129 --> 00:25:00,689
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna backslide.

371
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:06,035
All right. Let's go dancin'.

372
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:08,971
Ready? Whoo!

373
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:27,749
- How many pages is that?
- Eight pages.

374
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:34,491
It's so quiet.

375
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:05,792
Okay. Now we just need that $12,000 check-
the earnest money check.

376
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:09,960
If I can't make the big 10% down payment
in August, I can get this back, right?

377
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:15,371
Like, uh, if I don't get this job
that I thought I was gonna get?

378
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,809
Um, you forfeit that.
It will be a forfeiture in that amount.

379
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:22,005
- Is that bad?
- Yes.

380
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,312
"Forfeit," as in, you don't
get the money back.

381
00:26:26,384 --> 00:26:29,478
The seller keeps the money.
It's so they're not hung out to dry...

382
00:26:29,554 --> 00:26:32,182
and it's also a way
of preventing schmucks...

383
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,282
from trying to purchase
houses they can't afford.

384
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:36,554
Yeah. Schmucks.

385
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:39,392
- What are you talking about?
- Schmucks who buy houses they can't afford.

386
00:26:39,464 --> 00:26:42,024
- Are there really schmucks like that?
- Well, every once in a while...

387
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,227
we'll encounter a schmuck like that-
not often.

388
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:50,735
<i>- Hey! Man, what the hell?
- Ah!</i>

389
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:54,472
Holy shit.

390
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:57,174
- That was "Teddy"?
- Yeah.

391
00:26:57,248 --> 00:27:00,547
- He's smaller than I imagined.
- Yeah, well, he's got a lot of stamina.

392
00:27:04,356 --> 00:27:06,790
<i>It took us five years to save $ 12,000...</i>

393
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:09,088
<i>and I might have
just schmucked it away.</i>

394
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,628
<i>So Richard might be
a nice recovering drug guy...</i>

395
00:27:11,696 --> 00:27:15,393
<i>but if I could slide ahead of him
at the company retreat, I was going to do it.</i>

396
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:20,029
Hey, leaders in quality foods,
the Donaldson's difference- it's people.

397
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:23,871
<i>And all of you-
here's the great news- are people.</i>

398
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:27,275
<i>Now concentration allows you
to shut out distraction.</i>

399
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:30,337
Shutting out distraction, gang,
allows you...

400
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:34,545
<i>to accomplish your goals
and achieve new heights!</i>

401
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:40,890
Get it in here, Chicagoland Donaldson's.
Come on.

402
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:43,928
<i>Tout de suite it in here, make a stack of hands.
Right here in the middle.</i>

403
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:46,361
<i>Let's go.
Bunch of hands, here we go. Ready?</i>

404
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:50,128
Now let's make it happen on "one."
Ready on "one"? One!

405
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:53,967
Let's make it happen!

406
00:27:56,307 --> 00:27:59,037
<i>Here we go. Let's go.
You can do this, Mitch. Concentration.</i>

407
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:01,476
And... block out distraction. Easy.

408
00:28:01,546 --> 00:28:04,709
Here we go, Aaron.
That's it. That's it. That's it!

409
00:28:04,783 --> 00:28:07,513
Doug, you can do it.
Block out distraction.

410
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:10,383
Block out distraction.
Very good.

411
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:14,915
<i>What do you think, Richard?
Here we go. And-</i>

412
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:18,485
It's not hot! It's not hot!

413
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:21,930
<i>You've essentially attained your goal.
Blockin' out distractions!</i>

414
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,934
Who's next?
Who's next?

415
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:26,562
<i>Let's do it, Steve. You've got it.
You've got it. You've got it!</i>

416
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:30,870
This guy's done this before, right?
You did this before on some weird island?

417
00:28:30,942 --> 00:28:33,376
Here we go.
Hey, burgundy jumpsuit!

418
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:36,437
<i>Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.</i>

419
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:43,915
Scott, you just concentrate,
concentrate, concentrate.

420
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:50,485
He didn't block out the distractions.

421
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:54,655
<i>- Just get in the pool. You can try it again.
- Stop!</i>

422
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,963
That's all right.
This is why we sign waivers, everybody.

423
00:28:57,035 --> 00:29:00,835
All right. Put the bags
on over your head. Everyone.

424
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:04,602
Right over the top.
Perfect. Okay.

425
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:10,512
Now, I want you to take off one thing
that you don't need... quickly! Come on!

426
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:25,456
Let's take something else off
that you really don't need... right away!

427
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:30,392
<i>Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.</i>

428
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:34,004
Something else you don't need.
Let's make it happen. Come on!

429
00:29:35,409 --> 00:29:38,304
Something else you don't
need. Come on. Let's go.

430
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:41,004
<i>Something completely unnecessary.</i>

431
00:29:43,915 --> 00:29:46,543
Doug, can we take our sack off?

432
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:48,643
What?

433
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,156
- Did you take your sack off?
- I can't really hear you.

434
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:56,922
People, take off one more thing that you
simply do... not... need.

435
00:29:57,929 --> 00:30:01,228
- Do it.
- Fuck.

436
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:15,579
<i>Okay, um-</i>

437
00:30:17,782 --> 00:30:21,445
All right, everybody that still has a bag
on top of their heads, scream...

438
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:24,682
"My concentration skills
need improvement."

439
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:28,556
<i>- One, two, three.
- My concentration skills need improvement!</i>

440
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,764
<i>Easy with the laughter.</i>

441
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,823
Easy with that.

442
00:30:40,438 --> 00:30:44,067
<i>That's enough. All right.</i>

443
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:46,141
<i>Who's up for some team building, huh?
Let's do it!</i>

444
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,678
<i>Let's head over
to the productivity obstacle course.</i>

445
00:30:49,747 --> 00:30:51,681
Guy, slap the clothes back on.

446
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:54,547
Let's just watch the assumptions.
That's all it is.

447
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:59,152
Yeah, is this Chicagoland Pepsi?

448
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:01,658
Connect to Kevin Conoway, please?

449
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,694
Richard Wehlner.

450
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:11,092
<i>Brighten the week with a sweet from Donaldson's...</i>

451
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:13,660
<i>the champion of excellence.</i>

452
00:31:40,498 --> 00:31:43,558
Scott, lot the full week?

453
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:48,834
Pepsi's sending a new season of stuff.
Yep. Kevin wants Richard.

454
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:53,810
- PepsiCo's chips and paperware-
- That's six days of bad cards from the lot.

455
00:31:53,878 --> 00:31:55,869
I got two weeks before the board
decides about Augusta.

456
00:31:55,947 --> 00:31:59,348
That's one week of suck cards.
Come on, Fargas.

457
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:02,011
- What, are you callin' me by my last name now?
- Scott.

458
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:06,250
Kevin wants Richard. That's Pepsi.
Don't make a stink about it.

459
00:32:06,324 --> 00:32:10,988
<i>You know what? I'm takin' lot. Give it to me.
They got lot concerns at Augusta.</i>

460
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:14,054
I'm gonna get some prime lot cards.
I'm gonna show 'em I can do it.

461
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:16,123
- Awesome.
- I'm gonna jam for six days.

462
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,134
Awesome.

463
00:32:18,202 --> 00:32:21,262
Let's make it happen!

464
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:32,310
<i>Hey, remove yourself! Get your pizza off there.
Get your butt off my car!</i>

465
00:32:32,383 --> 00:32:35,409
<i>Fuck you, Mr. Chopsticks.
You Chungking fuck ass.</i>

466
00:32:35,486 --> 00:32:39,718
<i>Hey, show some respect! Where is someone?
Can someone please help me?</i>

467
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:46,887
That's addressed to the board,
for the cards.

468
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:49,456
They want the fresh ones.

469
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:56,934
<i>Gordon "Jiminy."
A kid hanging out in your lot kidney punched me...</i>

470
00:32:57,008 --> 00:33:01,206
<i>because I offended him,
I guess, by doing nothing.</i>

471
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,474
<i>Kidney punched me.</i>

472
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:06,346
<i>There's a little bit
of a lack of security in your lot...</i>

473
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:09,648
<i>'cause your security guy
was sleeping in my car.</i>

474
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:11,878
Okay. The, uh-
The fucking chip is fixed...

475
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:15,612
and, uh, here we go-
right towards my own private vehicle...

476
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:18,246
<i>because that's how much confidence
I have in this.</i>

477
00:34:18,322 --> 00:34:20,347
Remember, this could be
your daughter.

478
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:25,862
Fuck!

479
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:29,627
... as I offer you
a blueprint for success in the workplace.

480
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:34,034
And, like the eagle, you'll create
a commanding atmosphere around-

481
00:34:34,105 --> 00:34:36,039
Richard Wehlner.

482
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:38,974
<i>If you ever have
to choose between working inside and outside...</i>

483
00:34:39,043 --> 00:34:42,535
<i>at a major American grocery store,
choose inside.</i>

484
00:34:42,613 --> 00:34:46,947
<i>Inside you have some freedom.
You have places to hide.</i>

485
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:54,185
<i>You can catch a breeze off the dairy cooler.
The girls work inside.</i>

486
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:00,222
Mmm.

487
00:35:00,298 --> 00:35:02,528
<i>Outside sucks.</i>

488
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,899
<i>I just wanted
to let you know that everything was top-notch.</i>

489
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:08,165
Yes.

490
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:10,571
<i>You guys are really getting your shit together.</i>

491
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:15,738
<i>I fuckin' had it for a while there,
but I've sensed a shift. Hey, good shift.</i>

492
00:35:15,813 --> 00:35:18,748
<i>Keep on truckin' in that direction.</i>

493
00:35:18,816 --> 00:35:20,750
<i>I'll be a repeat customer.</i>

494
00:35:25,022 --> 00:35:28,480
... cuttin' grass and shit?

495
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:32,154
I can call the police. So, just so you know,
this is Donaldson's property. You're trespassing.

496
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:34,221
- I'm on a parkin' lot.
- It's our lot.

497
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:38,064
<i>- Fuck you.
- Heh, your ma's courteous. She took my ride, sissy.</i>

498
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:41,902
<i>What does that mean? Hey! Well, give 'em back!</i>

499
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,533
Fuckin' get 'em.

500
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:46,702
Fuck!

501
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:53,249
Fuck!

502
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:55,911
Fuck you, man, you know?
Back up.

503
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:58,387
- Back what?
- Back up. I'm not fuckin' around, dick.

504
00:35:58,456 --> 00:36:00,924
What you call me, motherfucker?

505
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:04,257
Get off the lot! Get off me!

506
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:07,388
- Is he serious?
- Hey, he can't be fuckin' serious.

507
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:10,025
<i>- Have a nice day!
- Have a nice day!</i>

508
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:14,561
<i>You have a nice day, fuckin' assholes!</i>

509
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:22,245
Aren't you on lot?

510
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:24,804
I'm tryin' to fix these cards.
They got messed up.

511
00:36:24,882 --> 00:36:26,907
Don't forget, those go in today.

512
00:36:26,984 --> 00:36:29,748
Half hour, I'm gonna go down there.

513
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:33,085
- Who's on lot?
- Just Bredon. Keith's sick.

514
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:36,490
<i>Ah, put Octavio out.
He can come off Deli.</i>

515
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:38,495
<i>We got it covered.
You have the vest?</i>

516
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:41,293
In my locker.

517
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:43,663
- Thanks, Scott.
- All right.

518
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:56,402
I don't know what you say.

519
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:04,443
<i>I was trying to figure out if Brian..."Grall's"card...</i>

520
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:08,982
<i>said, "Your employees were very...
courageous"?</i>

521
00:37:12,663 --> 00:37:15,154
<i>I wondered,
were any of them courageous?</i>

522
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:18,794
<i>Esteban? No.
Little Esteban? No.</i>

523
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:28,606
<i>- Hey.
- Then I thought, fuck.</i>

524
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:33,275
<i>I found a whole stack
of D.E. 's in your locker.</i>

525
00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:38,244
- Stauber.
- Yeah.

526
00:37:38,322 --> 00:37:40,813
A whole stack.

527
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:44,952
Scott, man, lot's so messed up.

528
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:47,827
<i>I know it is,
but it's not about you, okay?</i>

529
00:37:47,898 --> 00:37:51,095
I'm going down to the Augusta Plus.

530
00:37:51,168 --> 00:37:54,515
Why don't you pack your
stack and take a ride with me?

531
00:37:54,516 --> 00:37:56,401
I wanna see you hand these over.

532
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:58,408
<i>Pack your stack.</i>

533
00:37:58,476 --> 00:38:02,003
A lot of the guys, when they're goin' out
to assist customers with their bags...

534
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,013
they're doin'
some lollygaggin' outside.

535
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:06,015
And everyone wants to get fresh air.

536
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:08,517
<i>Don't get me wrong.
I like fresh air...</i>

537
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:12,750
<i>but we need you inside,
or else we're short-</i>

538
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:19,325
<i>Several young men taunted me with chants...</i>

539
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:23,356
<i>of "ching chong Chinaman"
and "cinnamon face"!</i>

540
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:28,133
You know what? I'd like you
to read them to me right now.

541
00:38:28,205 --> 00:38:31,902
- Out loud?
- No, read them to me silently.

542
00:38:36,781 --> 00:38:41,445
"My grocery list didn't include
sexual harassment, but thanks.

543
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:44,317
Beth Kopins, 84."

544
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:49,919
- You want me to read all of these?
- Yes.

545
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:52,087
- Fuck.
- I'm sorry?

546
00:38:53,264 --> 00:38:55,858
That's on the card.

547
00:38:55,933 --> 00:38:59,460
"Fuck, that was a great
shopping experience."

548
00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:01,971
- It doesn't say that, does it?
- No.

549
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:04,906
What does it say then?

550
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:10,844
<i>Not a good demonstration of my managerial skills.</i>

551
00:39:10,915 --> 00:39:14,612
<i>But I just decided to bear down,
motivate my staff to raise their game...</i>

552
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:17,051
<i>and just get more hands-on.</i>

553
00:39:17,121 --> 00:39:17,188
<i>I was going to handle it. I was going
to keep my cool and handle anything.</i>

554
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:22,023
<i>I was going to handle it. I was going
to keep my cool and handle anything.</i>

555
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:24,678
<i>- Then something happened:
the Tater Tot incident</i>

556
00:39:24,679 --> 00:39:25,654
<i>You're on the lot.</i>

557
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:28,392
<i>provoked by what I call
the "Yoo-hoo smash."</i>

558
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:30,400
<i>Full Yoo-hoo.</i>

559
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:35,132
<i>Fuck!</i>

560
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:38,028
That's assault! I'm callin' the police.
You're gone!

561
00:39:38,029 --> 00:39:38,733
Suck my dick.

562
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:39,659
<i>You're fucking gone.</i>

563
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,471
All spiced up with a little Mace.

564
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:49,348
- I mean, what did he do? Did he grab you?
- He, like-

565
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,615
A bottle hit me,
and then he tugged at my shirt.

566
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:54,658
- He threw it?
- I don't know, someone in the group!

567
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:57,319
Hey, you Maced him full in the face.
He's in the hospital.

568
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:58,584
<i>Why don't you calm down?</i>

569
00:39:58,585 --> 00:40:00,831
<i>He hit me in the head with a bottle.
It's out there.</i>

570
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:03,298
<i>Look, pal, there's a lot of bottles out there.</i>

571
00:40:03,367 --> 00:40:05,835
What I know is, he's got a face
full of liquid frenzine...

572
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:10,033
<i>his mom and dad are upset, and I'm tryin'
to figure out what he did to you.</i>

573
00:40:10,107 --> 00:40:14,976
<i>They wanna talk to somebody-
an owner, they said.</i>

574
00:40:15,045 --> 00:40:17,138
<i>I have to call the board.
Frig.</i>

575
00:40:17,214 --> 00:40:20,672
- Man, he grabbed me.
- Are you going to press charges?

576
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:25,120
<i>I don't know. I have to talk to the board.
Are they? Can they?</i>

577
00:40:25,189 --> 00:40:28,681
I don't know.
The parents are upset.

578
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:43,399
Javier, what are you-
You just left these here?

579
00:40:43,474 --> 00:40:45,499
The bag's damaged.

580
00:40:45,576 --> 00:40:49,068
What, are they gonna melt?
Come on, man.

581
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:55,051
This is bullshit.

582
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,680
This... is...

583
00:40:58,756 --> 00:41:00,724
bull...

584
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:03,453
- shit!
- Ow!

585
00:41:03,527 --> 00:41:06,223
- Hey! Whoa!
- What?

586
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,414
He's whippin' stuff at me.

587
00:41:07,415 --> 00:41:09,733
I was tossing them out.
He walked right in front of me.

588
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,860
It hit me in the wrist.
They're heavy.

589
00:41:12,937 --> 00:41:14,928
Ow. They're frozen.

590
00:41:15,005 --> 00:41:18,839
- Fuck you, Wehlner.
- What is your problem?

591
00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:21,036
You want to file an in-store?

592
00:41:21,111 --> 00:41:25,172
- What?
- An in-store. An in-store complaint?

593
00:41:25,249 --> 00:41:28,707
Geez. I don't know. It just-

594
00:41:28,786 --> 00:41:30,913
They're pretty dense.
They're frozen potatoes.

595
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:34,355
- Man, fuck you, Richard.
- What is your f'ing problem?

596
00:41:38,863 --> 00:41:42,094
Something's wrong.
What's been bothering you?

597
00:41:43,934 --> 00:41:45,925
You know, in the case
I don't get this job-

598
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:48,597
in a weird case
I don't get this job-

599
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:51,869
it's going to be four more years,
because there's no new store planned.

600
00:41:51,942 --> 00:41:55,901
You're making too much of this new job.
I mean, I can go back to school-

601
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:58,005
there's night school-
and be a practitioner.

602
00:41:58,082 --> 00:41:59,354
<i>You don't need this pressure.</i>

603
00:41:59,355 --> 00:42:01,779
<i>We can do it together, just like
we've done everything so far.</i>

604
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:05,288
<i>Jen, I don't want you waiting for the bus
at night in February.</i>

605
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:10,055
<i>You already work two shifts.
Night school? You don't want to go back.</i>

606
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:13,460
- I don't want to, but I will.
- You're not going to.

607
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,658
- Doug, look out!
- Oh, fuck.

608
00:42:15,733 --> 00:42:17,166
<i>- Hey! Hey!
- Hey.</i>

609
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:19,566
Hey! Hey!
What's your fucking problem?

610
00:42:19,637 --> 00:42:23,903
He has an issue with the coupons.

611
00:42:23,974 --> 00:42:25,250
What, man? What issue?

612
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:28,673
Y-You do not honor the coupons
anymore for his snacks, yeah?

613
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:31,751
All right. I'll honor your coupons.
Stop slapping me.

614
00:42:31,752 --> 00:42:32,307
Okay? Stop?

615
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:36,945
You can't go around slapping people.
What country are you from, Insane Land?

616
00:42:37,021 --> 00:42:39,615
<i>Hey, Jen.</i>

617
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:44,520
- Hey, guy.
- Hey.

618
00:42:53,037 --> 00:42:54,971
<i>I wonder if anyone else here...</i>

619
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:57,633
<i>got slapped in the eyes yesterday
over a graham cracker snack?</i>

620
00:42:57,708 --> 00:42:59,733
<i>Probably not.</i>

621
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:02,506
<i>I'm just gonna try to forget
about that particular embarrassment...</i>

622
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,548
<i>via some beers.</i>

623
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:11,444
<i>Hey. Wanna top me off there,
Teddy Grahams?</i>

624
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,228
Are you enjoying your drink?

625
00:43:18,295 --> 00:43:21,128
<i>Then I started working
at the grocery, and-</i>

626
00:43:21,198 --> 00:43:24,292
<i>You know, that's been pretty okay.</i>

627
00:43:24,368 --> 00:43:26,666
<i>Because you can have
a family, you know?</i>

628
00:43:26,737 --> 00:43:29,365
<i>And, uh, move up in administration.</i>

629
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,965
<i>Save a little money.
You know what I'm talkin' about.</i>

630
00:43:32,042 --> 00:43:33,566
<i>- Yeah.
- You know?</i>

631
00:43:33,644 --> 00:43:35,703
So it's been good-

632
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:38,145
till this guy from Quebec
comes along.

633
00:43:38,215 --> 00:43:40,012
You told me about that already.

634
00:43:40,084 --> 00:43:42,712
<i>- I did?
- Yeah.</i>

635
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:45,050
<i>Hey, I have an idea.</i>

636
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:48,353
<i>Let's get down sexually right now...</i>

637
00:43:48,425 --> 00:43:50,416
<i>while you play the banjo.</i>

638
00:43:50,494 --> 00:43:53,361
<i>- Good idea.
- Is that even possible?</i>

639
00:43:55,699 --> 00:43:57,667
<i>Oh, that's the spot, dude.</i>

640
00:43:57,735 --> 00:44:01,398
<i>- Oh, right on.
- I guess so.</i>

641
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:03,736
<i>I had to get up early that morning, too...</i>

642
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:06,173
<i>to write a Mace apology speech
for the community center.</i>

643
00:44:06,243 --> 00:44:09,406
<i>I hadn't written a speech since Webelos.</i>

644
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,381
"While on a courtesy patrol,
the group of young men...

645
00:44:12,449 --> 00:44:15,441
"approached a Donaldson's customer and me
while making threats...

646
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:18,352
and I was struck in the head
by a bottle of Yoo-hoo."

647
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:25,761
How do you know
who threw that Yoo-hoo?

648
00:44:27,531 --> 00:44:31,592
I noticed, um, previous to the thing...

649
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:35,127
that the young man that I had
the altercation with was drinking Yoo-hoo.

650
00:44:35,205 --> 00:44:39,471
After I was struck, I noticed that he wasn't
drinking Yoo-hoo anymore.

651
00:44:40,944 --> 00:44:44,072
And there was no one else
in the lot, so-

652
00:44:44,148 --> 00:44:48,107
"I discharged a single pull of Mace
in his direction."

653
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:50,244
I'm glad he's recovered.

654
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:54,984
"But the incident only occurred because
customer care is priority one at Donaldson's.

Thank you for coming."

Yeah.

670

- It's isolated.
- Oh, yeah. It's a one-time thing.

671
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,194
What's that?

672
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:08,026
I agree. It's isolated.
I think it was just some black apples.

We won't be seeing
that happen again.

674

Black apples.

675
00:46:17,474 --> 00:46:20,807

677
00:46:27,918 --> 00:46:30,011

- You said "black."

678

<i>I'm sorry if there's some confusion.
Maybe in the confusion, l-</i>

Hey, come on. It's been a long day.
That was a slip.

680
00:46:36,326 --> 00:46:38,226

<i>You are not a black apple to me.</i>

682

one black one in the batch. Not you.</i>

683
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:50,565
<i>And I didn't mean to say black.
I meant "back."</i>

"Blatch." "Blad."

740
00:50:17,647 --> 00:50:20,377
You say it was the best?

741
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:21,712
Yeah.

742
00:50:21,785 --> 00:50:23,912
That's pussy sauce.

743
00:50:25,989 --> 00:50:27,820
What?

744
00:50:27,891 --> 00:50:31,054
That's pussy sauce.

745
00:50:31,128 --> 00:50:33,062

- It's the home of the eagle.

756
00:51:29,953 --> 00:51:34,287

- Yeah. Yeah.

761
00:51:51,374 --> 00:51:52,659

Are you gonna write me up, Doug?

773

No, man.

774
00:52:46,062 --> 00:52:49,930
Yeah, I just- I just feel like
everything's getting to me.

775

I know.

776

Hey, smoke it down, bro.
I would, too, but I get bad headaches.

777
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:02,300
I had some, like, lost years.

778
00:53:04,281 --> 00:53:06,215
Man, I was in a motorcycle gang.

779
00:53:11,655 --> 00:53:13,646
Fuck you!

780
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,585
I guess I'll just get everybody.

781

<i>- Have a nice day, hon.
- You too.</i>

<i>Man, come on!</i>

783
00:53:30,574 --> 00:53:34,408
We found each other
and started a family.

784
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:38,404
We said we were gonna
make a go of it.

785
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:44,153
It's just hard.

786
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:47,281
I mean, day care's 300.
Our premiums are 400.

787
00:53:47,357 --> 00:53:49,621
This dance class is $280 U.S.

788
00:53:49,693 --> 00:53:51,627
Yeah.

789
00:53:53,697 --> 00:53:55,688
This is what I did.

790
00:53:55,765 --> 00:53:58,791
I bought a house
that I can't even-

791
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:02,803
I can't even nearly afford.

792
00:54:05,675 --> 00:54:08,303
I'm gonna tell Lori I toked up.

793
00:54:08,378 --> 00:54:11,279
<i>Yeah. I'm gonna tell Jen.
I have to.</i>

794
00:54:11,348 --> 00:54:13,282
Because that's how you get happy-

795
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:16,717
leading an honest life no matter
what your life's like beside.

796
00:54:18,521 --> 00:54:21,888
So I'm telling her.
Because that's a man.

797
00:54:21,958 --> 00:54:24,153
Because-

798
00:54:24,227 --> 00:54:27,492
<i>If you have that
"to the max" clean love-</i>

799
00:54:27,564 --> 00:54:29,828
man, that-that "all the way" love-

800
00:54:31,835 --> 00:54:35,703
then you could be even,
like, a midget or something...

801
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:37,797
and still light it up with a smile.

802
00:54:39,809 --> 00:54:42,903
So go on, let it shine.

803
00:54:42,979 --> 00:54:45,846
I'm not bullshittin'.
Lori, I can make a go of it.

804
00:54:45,915 --> 00:54:48,475
We're goin'. We're goin' to Glasgow,
fuckin' like it or not.

805
00:54:48,551 --> 00:54:52,510
Okay, great. Yeah, go visit your grammy.
And then come on back, yeah?

806
00:54:52,589 --> 00:54:55,387
Make it a holiday. I'll show you
I can make a big dancing go of it.

807
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:57,585
Tell your grammy I said hi.
I'll be seeing her.

808
00:54:57,661 --> 00:55:00,255
I'll tell Grammy that you're a doper.
I'll tell Grammy that.

809
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:02,491
Whoa. Lori, don't.

810
00:55:02,565 --> 00:55:05,466
<i>Okay, Chrissie. Have a little holiday
with your grammy.</i>

811
00:55:05,535 --> 00:55:08,732
- All right. Let's go.
- I'll be seein' ya.

812
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:10,796
Lori, make it a holiday.

813
00:55:13,677 --> 00:55:17,340
- Will you get the mail in when you get home?
- Yeah. No problem.

814
00:55:17,414 --> 00:55:19,382
- I gotta tell you something.
- Mark, you remember Doug.

815
00:55:19,449 --> 00:55:22,612
- Yeah. Hey. Teddy Grahams.
- Yeah, hey.

816
00:55:22,686 --> 00:55:25,159
We got surgery at 10:00.
A cleft palate- two-year-old.

817
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:25,519
Okay.

818
00:55:25,588 --> 00:55:27,277
What's a cleft palate?

819
00:55:27,278 --> 00:55:31,117
It's a deformation of the "mascus"
- the lower face.

820
00:55:31,194 --> 00:55:34,527
Medically, it's "masculari horriblus"...

821
00:55:34,597 --> 00:55:37,725
which is Latin for "monster face."

822
00:55:37,801 --> 00:55:41,897
And I guess some of these kids
really do feel like monsters.

823
00:55:41,971 --> 00:55:45,031
But we restore them to normalcy.

824
00:55:45,108 --> 00:55:47,372
You should see it, man.
It's beautiful.

825
00:55:50,113 --> 00:55:52,411
- Man.
- Yeah.

826
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:00,983
- What? Tell me what.
- Nothing. I'll see you tonight.

827
00:56:01,057 --> 00:56:02,786
Okay.

828
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,985
- Let me show you something.
- Yeah.

829
00:56:13,269 --> 00:56:16,966
<i>One way to go from
planning to tell the truth to telling another lie...</i>

830
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:20,771
<i>is to find a gift from your wife-
who has no money-</i>

831
00:56:20,844 --> 00:56:23,005
<i>of some long-sleeved shirts...</i>

832
00:56:23,079 --> 00:56:25,013
<i>because she believes
you'll dress more formally...</i>

833
00:56:25,081 --> 00:56:28,778
<i>as the shoo-in boss of a large grocery
because you said this.</i>

834
00:56:28,852 --> 00:56:31,912
<i>When the truth is you might
stay a "short sleever"...</i>

835
00:56:31,988 --> 00:56:35,856
<i>for the foreseeable future
of thousands of days.</i>

836
00:56:35,925 --> 00:56:38,655
- Hey. I like my shirts.
- Hey.

837
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:40,958
What are you doing?

838
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:44,591
It's for night school-
for the school thing, for just in case.

839
00:56:44,667 --> 00:56:46,601
I thought I should do it.

840
00:56:46,669 --> 00:56:50,469
- Are you worried?
- No. But just in case.

841
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:53,373
<i>I didn't want to miss the sign-up.
I want to save a spot.</i>

842
00:56:53,443 --> 00:56:57,106

- 180.</i>

843
00:56:58,815 --> 00:57:01,181
Don't. Because I got the job.

844
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:03,719
- They decided?
- Yeah. I got the job.

845
00:57:03,787 --> 00:57:07,052
- Doug! You are great!
- Yeah.

846
00:57:08,057 --> 00:57:10,525
Good-bye, banjo fuckers!

847
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:12,527
Yeah.

848
00:57:18,802 --> 00:57:20,736
<i>I don't know what that was.</i>

849
00:57:20,804 --> 00:57:23,136
<i>A lie wish?</i>

850
00:57:23,206 --> 00:57:25,868
<i>Way to go, Doug!</i>

851
00:57:28,077 --> 00:57:30,011
Whoo.

852
00:57:51,734 --> 00:57:54,362
<i>Hey, Scott, I wanted to mention, um-</i>

853
00:57:54,437 --> 00:57:56,428
My wrist is acting up a little...

854
00:57:56,506 --> 00:57:59,031
from the Tater Tot thing.

855
00:57:59,108 --> 00:58:03,044
So I think I should
probably do that in-store.

856
00:58:03,112 --> 00:58:04,875
The in-store complaint?

857
00:58:04,948 --> 00:58:07,041
- Yeah.
- All right.

858
00:58:07,116 --> 00:58:09,550
That circulates through the company-

859
00:58:09,619 --> 00:58:12,611
to the board, everywhere.

860
00:58:12,689 --> 00:58:16,785
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. I think that's probably for the best.

861
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:18,885
You know, in case he does it
to somebody else.

862
00:58:20,263 --> 00:58:24,199
- Okay. I'll get the forms.
- Thanks, Scott.

863
00:58:24,267 --> 00:58:28,601

- You did? That sounds awesome.
- Yeah.

893
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:45,240
<i>- Guess what.
- What?</i>

894
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:49,438
- I'm growing a mustache.
- All right. That's cool.

895
01:00:49,512 --> 01:00:52,538
Hey, Hardy, you're doing a great job
in the store here.

896
01:00:52,615 --> 01:00:54,606
- Thanks. You too, man.
- Keep it up.

897
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:09,427
<i>- What's going on?
- Oh, nothing.</i>

898
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:12,297
Just... Hardy.

899
01:01:12,368 --> 01:01:14,928
<i>It just gets sad sometimes.</i>

900
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:17,529
Do you know why Hardy's hand
is powdered?

901
01:01:17,607 --> 01:01:20,303
Why?

902
01:01:20,376 --> 01:01:23,402
'Cause retarded guys
masturbate so much...

903
01:01:23,479 --> 01:01:26,573
that they rub the skin
off their penises.

904
01:01:26,649 --> 01:01:30,141
It's just-They don't know better.

905
01:01:30,219 --> 01:01:33,347
<i>Just-They have a hard time
not jerkin' off.</i>

906
01:01:35,224 --> 01:01:37,954
- Hey.
- Hey, guys.

907
01:01:39,662 --> 01:01:43,189
- Scott in?
- Yeah.

908
01:01:43,266 --> 01:01:46,497
- I think Scott's in Receiving.
- Okay.

909
01:01:46,569 --> 01:01:48,285
I wanted to ask you a
question about the application.

910
01:01:48,286 --> 01:01:48,730
No problem.

911
01:01:48,805 --> 01:01:50,739
I'll see you guys later, all right?

912
01:01:50,807 --> 01:01:52,741
Hey, fellas.

913
01:01:57,313 --> 01:01:59,304
What was he doing?

914
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:03,409
- Was he talking about jacking off?
- Richard?

915
01:02:03,486 --> 01:02:05,954
He was talking about jacking it?

916
01:02:06,022 --> 01:02:07,956
In front of customers?
Jacking dicks?

917
01:02:21,337 --> 01:02:25,034
Yeah. Yeah, I guess so. Yeah.

918
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:49,698
F. you!

919
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:52,530
- What?
- I didn't say that.

920
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:55,469
They asked me what you said.
That's what you said.

921
01:02:55,538 --> 01:02:58,837
- You know what? Fuck you, Doug.
- That's what you said.

922
01:02:58,908 --> 01:03:01,308
How's your wrist?
How's your wrist, Richard?

923
01:03:01,377 --> 01:03:03,641
- You're bogus.
- I'm bogus?

924
01:03:03,713 --> 01:03:05,816
You lace that thing on,
try to fuck me out of a job-

925
01:03:05,817 --> 01:03:07,046
out of money for me and my wife.

926
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:08,845
Those things weigh 62 grams.

927
01:03:08,918 --> 01:03:12,752
I don't know what a gram is,
but I guess that's a lot 'cause you're hurt.

928
01:03:12,822 --> 01:03:14,756
Get off me, Wehlner!

929
01:03:14,824 --> 01:03:17,190
See you later, Tappy.

930
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:20,161
What, are you wearing tap shoes?

931
01:03:20,229 --> 01:03:22,163
Lori left me, little boy.

932
01:03:22,231 --> 01:03:24,597
It's the only class
I can attend as a single.

933
01:03:24,667 --> 01:03:27,033
Goddamn! Come on!

934
01:03:32,408 --> 01:03:34,433
<i>Is that guy wearing tap shoes?</i>

935
01:03:38,181 --> 01:03:40,615
Come on!

936
01:03:40,683 --> 01:03:42,275
- Fuck off!
- Yeah?

937
01:03:42,351 --> 01:03:44,251
Come on, dick!
Come on!

938
01:03:47,123 --> 01:03:49,023
- Fuck you!
- Hold it! Not cool!

939
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:53,622
Not cool! Go inside.

940
01:03:55,698 --> 01:03:58,166
Sorry, Scott.

941
01:03:58,234 --> 01:04:00,361
<i>- Dancing bear.
- Yeah, wife liar!</i>

942
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:07,269
<i>I was lunching with Jen...</i>

943
01:04:07,343 --> 01:04:10,278
<i>trying to forget about it and roll into
the crucial second interview.</i>

944
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:14,406
<i>Then I spied that Big World.</i>

945
01:04:14,483 --> 01:04:16,508
<i>Remember Do-Good and Dodo?</i>

946
01:04:17,787 --> 01:04:20,915
<i>Dodo makes lunchtime
unpleasant for everyone.</i>

947
01:04:30,499 --> 01:04:34,094
<i>Do-Good shares his peanut brittle
with the new... Negro.</i>

948
01:04:36,472 --> 01:04:38,497
"Negro"?

949
01:04:38,574 --> 01:04:41,441
What the fuck?

950
01:04:45,147 --> 01:04:47,843
- Hey, babe.
- Hey.

951
01:04:49,418 --> 01:04:52,319
<i>Sometimes, Do-Good cleans up a mess...</i>

952
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:54,322
<i>even if he didn't make it.</i>

953
01:04:56,659 --> 01:05:00,151
<i>Dodo is sometimes simply
not a good young man.</i>

954
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:23,711
<i>Hey, Lori. It's me.</i>

955
01:05:23,786 --> 01:05:26,812
Hey, uh, tomorrow's the big day-
the final sit-down.

956
01:05:26,889 --> 01:05:29,255
You know, the final interview thing.

957
01:05:29,325 --> 01:05:31,452
Then they make their decision.

958
01:05:31,527 --> 01:05:33,995
Hey, guess what.
I'm taking tap dancing.

959
01:05:34,063 --> 01:05:37,829
<i>The studio wouldn't give me
the deposit back, so I'm tappin'.</i>

960
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:40,061
<i>I've gotta say I really like it.
It's real-</i>

961
01:05:40,136 --> 01:05:42,866
It's a real dance style.
Very expressive.

962
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:46,067
Um, anyway, whatever.
I'm still dancin', practicin'.

963
01:05:46,142 --> 01:05:48,076
And, uh-

964
01:05:48,144 --> 01:05:50,669
Listen, Lori.

965
01:05:50,746 --> 01:05:52,976
<i>I love you, and I miss you.</i>

966
01:05:54,517 --> 01:05:56,246
Bye.

967
01:05:56,319 --> 01:06:00,688
<i># And deep down
we were really in love #</i>

968
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:05,621
<i># Oh, but I'm tired
of holdin' on #</i>

969
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:07,822
<i># To a feelin'
I know is gone #</i>

970
01:06:07,897 --> 01:06:11,492
<i>A man probably has just a half dozen or so...</i>

971
01:06:11,567 --> 01:06:14,695
<i>really critical days in his life-
that's all-</i>

972
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:19,798
<i>a few days that can totally determine
the quality of his future.</i>

973
01:06:19,875 --> 01:06:24,539
<i>This chapter is dedicated to helping you-
Richard Wehlner-</i>

974
01:06:24,613 --> 01:06:30,313
<i>to make the most of the few really golden
opportunities many of us will actually have.</i>

975
01:06:30,386 --> 01:06:34,482
<i>So let's let this classic track
take us into Chapter 10.</i>

976
01:06:34,557 --> 01:06:39,051
<i>"Time for Me to Fly."</i>

977
01:06:39,128 --> 01:06:41,824
<i># Time for me to fly #</i>

978
01:06:41,897 --> 01:06:45,128
<i># Oh, I've got
to set myself free #</i>

979
01:06:45,201 --> 01:06:47,931
<i>- # Time for me to fly #
- # Oh, baby #</i>

980
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:51,701
<i># That's just how
it's got to be #</i>

981
01:06:51,774 --> 01:06:56,234
<i># Oh, I know it hurts
to say good-bye #</i>

982
01:06:56,312 --> 01:06:59,440
<i># But it's time for me to fly #</i>

983
01:06:59,515 --> 01:07:02,143
<i># It's time for me to fly #</i>

984
01:07:02,218 --> 01:07:05,449
<i># It's time for me to fly #</i>

985
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:07,989
<i># It's time for me to fly #</i>

986
01:07:08,057 --> 01:07:10,855
<i># It's time for me to fly #</i>

987
01:07:10,926 --> 01:07:13,759
<i># It's time for me to fly #</i>

988
01:07:13,829 --> 01:07:17,287
<i># It's time for me to fly ##</i>

989
01:07:17,366 --> 01:07:20,164
<i>By the way, don't tell anyone that track's on here.</i>

990
01:07:20,236 --> 01:07:22,466
<i>Because I didn't pay
for the licensing.</i>

991
01:07:27,076 --> 01:07:29,101
<i>You have to pull the card back out.</i>

992
01:07:34,650 --> 01:07:38,848
<i>Orange Line, Midway. Now changing to direct.</i>

993
01:07:38,921 --> 01:07:41,549
<i>Orange Line, Midway.
Now changing to direct.</i>

994
01:08:33,809 --> 01:08:36,642
<i>We have a temporary delay.</i>

995
01:08:51,694 --> 01:08:53,628
<i>#When #</i>

996
01:08:55,264 --> 01:08:59,963
<i># Whenever Paul #</i>

997
01:09:01,370 --> 01:09:04,828
<i># Thinks of rain #</i>

998
01:09:07,042 --> 01:09:10,739
<i># Swallows fall #</i>

999
01:09:13,082 --> 01:09:17,576
<i># In a wave #</i>

1000
01:09:19,054 --> 01:09:23,650
<i># And tap on his window #</i>

1001
01:09:23,726 --> 01:09:26,593
Chapter 12. "Finishing Strong."

1002
01:09:26,662 --> 01:09:30,291
<i>I've written this chapter
as a reminder of your new skills.</i>

1003
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,730
Perhaps you'll choose
to listen to this passage...

1004
01:09:33,802 --> 01:09:36,327
on the morning
of your most important day.

1005
01:09:37,606 --> 01:09:41,372
So here it goes,
because you're ready.

1006
01:09:41,443 --> 01:09:43,377
Richard Wehlner-

1007
01:09:43,445 --> 01:09:45,379
is totally number one.

1008
01:09:46,448 --> 01:09:48,780
Because- Richard Wehlner-

1009
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:50,785
shows true grit.

1010
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:55,187
Richard Wehlner-
is not afraid to put others under his thumb...

1011
01:09:55,257 --> 01:10:01,059
<i>because- Richard Wehlner-
totally does more than what's expected.</i>

1012
01:10:01,130 --> 01:10:03,291
<i># Rings just once #</i>

1013
01:10:03,365 --> 01:10:08,894
<i># Late at night #</i>

1014
01:10:08,971 --> 01:10:13,101
<i># Like a bird #</i>

1015
01:10:13,175 --> 01:10:15,769
<i># Don't be scared #</i>

1016
01:10:15,844 --> 01:10:20,872
<i># Don't believe
you're all alone #</i>

1017
01:10:24,353 --> 01:10:28,016
<i># Wake #</i>

1018
01:10:28,090 --> 01:10:32,789
<i># Wake up, Paul #</i>

1019
01:10:32,861 --> 01:10:37,594
<i># Whisper clouds #</i>

1020
01:10:37,666 --> 01:10:43,036
<i># Rolling by #</i>

1021
01:10:43,105 --> 01:10:48,270
<i># And the seeds ##</i>

1022
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:53,505
<i>Is there anything you'd like to add?</i>

1023
01:10:53,582 --> 01:10:56,312
<i>Just that I'd give
the new store my all.</i>

1024
01:10:56,385 --> 01:10:58,319
I think you would.

1025
01:10:58,387 --> 01:11:01,117
Good. So if there's nothing else...

1026
01:11:01,190 --> 01:11:03,181
send in jack apples.

1027
01:11:04,793 --> 01:11:07,489
<i>Let's get applejacker's
interview over with.</i>

1028
01:11:07,563 --> 01:11:10,464
That cheese cracker.

1029
01:11:16,438 --> 01:11:18,872
Good luck.

1030
01:11:18,941 --> 01:11:20,932
Because you're gonna need it.

1031
01:11:22,144 --> 01:11:25,341
<i>Before I get Richard,
I just-</i>

1032
01:11:29,018 --> 01:11:33,387
<i>We have this bag boy- Hardy.
I wanted to tell you that, when you thought...</i>

1033
01:11:33,455 --> 01:11:36,891
that Richard Wehlner
was talking trash talk, as you said...

1034
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:40,827
Richard was just letting me know there are
parts of Hardy's life that made him sad.

1035
01:11:40,896 --> 01:11:44,423
- That's all.
- Which parts?

1036
01:11:47,102 --> 01:11:51,596
Um, the parts where Hardy
can't stop masturbating his penis.

1037
01:11:51,674 --> 01:11:55,610
<i>So he has a powdered right hand
for a deterrent.</i>

1038
01:11:58,714 --> 01:12:01,706
Wouldn't powder make
the experience better?

1039
01:12:03,018 --> 01:12:06,476
Uh, probably, but-

1040
01:12:06,555 --> 01:12:11,424
This is a specific powder
with sandpaper-like qualities, I think.

1041
01:12:11,493 --> 01:12:15,224
<i>All I'm saying is that-
Richard is a good guy.</i>

1042
01:12:16,899 --> 01:12:18,867
<i>He's not out of line
or inappropriate.</i>

1043
01:12:18,934 --> 01:12:21,402
I wanted you to know.

1044
01:12:21,470 --> 01:12:23,461
He's a real good grocer.

1045
01:12:23,539 --> 01:12:26,099
So if there was
no inappropriate talk...

1046
01:12:26,175 --> 01:12:28,541
I guess that leaves you guys
on equal footing.

1047
01:12:32,281 --> 01:12:35,307
Yeah. I guess.

1048
01:12:36,518 --> 01:12:39,112
<i>Tell Richard we'll be with him
in five minutes.</i>

1049
01:12:44,059 --> 01:12:46,619
Are you all done?

1050
01:12:46,695 --> 01:12:49,562
They said wait around.

1051
01:12:49,631 --> 01:12:52,532
- For what?
- They didn't say.

1052
01:12:52,601 --> 01:12:54,592
They just said wait around.

1053
01:13:30,105 --> 01:13:32,039
I'm fucked.

1054
01:14:07,776 --> 01:14:10,506
Hey. Richard.

1055
01:14:12,147 --> 01:14:14,081
Doug.

1056
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:17,582
We're all just out here
tryin' to get some food.

1057
01:14:19,721 --> 01:14:22,155
Sometimes we bump into each other.

1058
01:14:31,633 --> 01:14:33,567
Stay loose, Doug.

1059
01:14:44,947 --> 01:14:48,508
<i># Every day, I'm gonna
strut that stuff#</i>

1060
01:14:48,584 --> 01:14:50,779
<i>Hey. I've enjoyed our time together.</i>

1061
01:14:50,853 --> 01:14:53,048
But now it's time
for you to get out there...

1062
01:14:53,121 --> 01:14:55,646
and just kick everyone's ass.

1063
01:14:55,724 --> 01:15:00,093
See you at the yacht club, my good friend-
Richard Wehln-

1064
01:15:13,342 --> 01:15:16,402
- Do one thing for me.
- Yeah, babe.

1065
01:15:16,478 --> 01:15:18,639
You fix that little ship...

1066
01:15:18,714 --> 01:15:21,649
and you keep it cool
and keep it clean, mister.

1067
01:15:21,717 --> 01:15:25,050
- Chrissie's sleepin'.
- Okay.

1068
01:15:33,128 --> 01:15:35,619
<i>Don't get f'ing tangled.
Come on.</i>

1069
01:15:42,437 --> 01:15:44,428
Tell me again why you're not at work.

1070
01:15:44,506 --> 01:15:46,736
I carved out some free time.

1071
01:15:46,808 --> 01:15:49,675
- On your first day?
- Yep.

1072
01:15:54,049 --> 01:15:56,210
You didn't start
your new job today, did you?

1073
01:15:57,286 --> 01:15:59,220
No.

1074
01:16:01,323 --> 01:16:04,724
You didn't actually get it yet,
did you?

1075
01:16:04,793 --> 01:16:06,818
No.

1076
01:16:06,895 --> 01:16:09,022
Doug, why did you tell me that?

1077
01:16:09,097 --> 01:16:11,691
I said I could go back to school.

1078
01:16:11,767 --> 01:16:15,032
I want to be the primary
breadwinner, Jen. Come on.

1079
01:16:17,806 --> 01:16:19,797
Female lions do the hunting.

1080
01:16:21,476 --> 01:16:24,274
I'm not a lion.

1081
01:16:24,346 --> 01:16:26,337
I'm a guy.

1082
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:28,713
<i>Get up there, son of a b.</i>

1083
01:16:39,428 --> 01:16:42,158
- I was embarrassed.
- About what?

1084
01:16:42,230 --> 01:16:44,164
Our life.

1085
01:16:44,232 --> 01:16:46,723
- And George Washington Carver.
- George-

1086
01:16:46,802 --> 01:16:49,100
Who made all this stuff
out of peanuts-

1087
01:16:49,171 --> 01:16:51,105
blankets, peanut silverware...

1088
01:16:51,173 --> 01:16:53,107
a peanut car, a peanut gun.

1089
01:16:53,175 --> 01:16:55,507
<i>- No, he didn't.
- He made some peanut stuff.</i>

1090
01:16:55,577 --> 01:16:57,738
And he was a slave.

1091
01:16:57,813 --> 01:17:00,043
<i>I should've made something by now.</i>

1092
01:17:00,115 --> 01:17:02,549
<i>I'm 33 years old.
I sell peanuts.</i>

1093
01:17:04,686 --> 01:17:06,677
<i>I am peanuts.</i>

1094
01:17:11,093 --> 01:17:13,653
You're such a guy.

1095
01:17:24,506 --> 01:17:25,495
Hey.

1096
01:17:27,476 --> 01:17:28,500
Fuck!

1097
01:17:33,115 --> 01:17:36,175
- I tried, babe.
- I know.

1098
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:40,985
I'll get the next one, babe,
all the way.

1099
01:17:41,056 --> 01:17:44,389
<i>- I know.
- I love you.</i>

1100
01:17:44,459 --> 01:17:46,620
<i>Love you too.</i>

1101
01:18:18,093 --> 01:18:21,426
- Hello.
- Doug. Mitch from Donaldson's.

1102
01:18:21,496 --> 01:18:23,487
<i>- Hey.
- We've made our choice.</i>

1103
01:18:23,565 --> 01:18:27,729
Between you and me, Richard
failed his drug test- spectacularly.

1104
01:18:27,803 --> 01:18:29,930
So it was you and Donnie Wahls
from Lakeview.

1105
01:18:30,005 --> 01:18:31,939
But he's pretty junior.

1106
01:18:32,007 --> 01:18:35,101
So I'm calling to say
welcome aboard.

1107
01:18:37,846 --> 01:18:41,179
- Oh, man.
- Yeah.

1108
01:18:41,249 --> 01:18:43,183
I just wanted to say welcome aboard.

1109
01:18:43,251 --> 01:18:46,414
Oh, hey. Welcome aboard
to you too, Mitch.

1110
01:18:46,488 --> 01:18:49,217
Yeah. Doug, we'll see you
on the seventh at 8:00 a.m.

1111
01:18:49,218 --> 01:18:49,924
Okay, yeah.

1112
01:18:49,991 --> 01:18:53,188
- Hey-Hey, Mitch. Thanks.
- See you, Doug.

1113
01:18:59,868 --> 01:19:03,031
<i>Standing downtown,
I thought of everything that happened.</i>

1114
01:19:03,105 --> 01:19:05,039
<i>Was I the better man?</i>

1115
01:19:05,107 --> 01:19:07,439
<i>I don't know.
I just know I started running.</i>

1116
01:19:07,509 --> 01:19:09,443
<i>Maybe because
I got something I needed.</i>

1117
01:19:09,511 --> 01:19:11,536
<i>And if I met Richard
in the street or somewhere...</i>

1118
01:19:11,613 --> 01:19:13,604
<i>I think I could still
shake his hand.</i>

1119
01:19:14,616 --> 01:19:17,278
<i>So was I the better man?</i>

1120
01:19:17,352 --> 01:19:19,343
<i>I don't know.
I just felt like a man.</i>

1121
01:19:23,892 --> 01:19:27,123
<i>Man, I hadn't felt that good
since I placed silver in Boys' Apparatus-</i>

1122
01:19:29,030 --> 01:19:30,622
<i>in the Junior Olympics.</i>

1123
01:19:39,975 --> 01:19:41,909
Yeah!

1124
01:19:49,851 --> 01:19:54,584
<i>I never saw Richard again, but I heard
he went back to Canada with his family...</i>

1125
01:19:54,656 --> 01:19:56,419
<i>back to his old grocery.</i>

1126
01:19:56,491 --> 01:19:59,927
<i>I also heard he put out a storage room fire
with his bare hands or something...</i>

1127
01:19:59,995 --> 01:20:02,088
<i>and got promoted to manager.</i>

1128
01:20:02,164 --> 01:20:06,191
<i>There are rumors he started the fire himself
for self-promotion purposes.</i>

1129
01:20:06,268 --> 01:20:09,396
<i>But either way,
he's a higher-up now.</i>

1130
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:12,634
<i>And that's cool, because he can
get a place for his wife and girl.</i>

1131
01:20:12,707 --> 01:20:15,801
<i>He can save a little something
off to the side for himself too.</i>

1132
01:20:15,877 --> 01:20:17,868
<i>I don't know, maybe a new chopper.</i>

1133
01:20:30,258 --> 01:20:34,058
<i>#Put your face where we can see it #</i>

1134
01:20:35,831 --> 01:20:39,824
<i># Put it on a show on cable #</i>

1135
