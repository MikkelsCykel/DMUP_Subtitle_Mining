Want this guy to go away

307
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:02,878
No.

308
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:06,245
Can get you 3 to 5, guaranteed.
That's a very decent resut.

309
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:07,880
'M taking guaranteed time,

310
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:09,918
not maybe, not the jury
didn't fee up to it.

311
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,114
That's worth more than chasing some
make-beieve 10 to ife

312
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:12,985
and the guy waks free.

Mr. Hume. 've got one eyewitness. You.

316
00:18:18,063 --> 00:18:18,654
That's nice.

317
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:20,594
But do you know how many cases

don't even bother to try for a dea on?

319
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,265
The machete magicay disappeared.

320
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,267
The ony bood we coud
find on that wease was his own

321
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:27,462
from when the car cipped him.

322
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:29,300
And you picked
the ony gas station in America

323
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:31,272
without a working surveiance camera.

324
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:33,443
We've just got your word.

325
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:36,206
That's not bad,
if can scare the guy into a dea.

326
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:39,714
You're using my son's death
ike some kind of card trick.

327
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:43,150
Look, get a banger off the street

00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:49,485
He finds Jesus. Fine with me.

331
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:51,561
But we get reigion and go to trai,
