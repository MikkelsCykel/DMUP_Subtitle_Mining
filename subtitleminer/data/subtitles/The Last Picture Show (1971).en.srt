2
00:02:25,457 --> 00:02:30,000
President Truman will be here tomorrow,
so you folks in Dallas turn out.

3
00:02:30,253 --> 00:02:33,289
This is Cowboy Rhythms
on KTRN, Wichita Falls.

4
00:02:33,548 --> 00:02:36,465
Here's Hank Williams' hit tune,
"Cold, Cold Heart."

5
00:02:42,431 --> 00:02:44,554
You ain't ever gonna amount to nothing.

6
00:02:44,767 --> 00:02:48,681
Already spent a dime this morning,
ain't even had breakfast.

7
00:02:49,771 --> 00:02:51,265
Give me the chalk.

8
00:02:56,694 --> 00:03:00,277
Why don't you comb your hair, Sonny?
It sticks up.

9
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:12,913
I'm surprised
you had the nerve to show up...

10
00:03:13,168 --> 00:03:15,410
...after that stomping you took last night.

11
00:03:17,214 --> 00:03:18,043
What'd you say?

12
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,455
Could've been worse.

13
00:03:21,176 --> 00:03:22,420
Yeah.

14
00:03:23,177 --> 00:03:25,384
You can say that about everything.

15
00:03:29,308 --> 00:03:31,929
A few teams have had
some luck with tackling.

16
00:03:32,227 --> 00:03:34,765
Keeps the other team
from scoring so often.

17
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,771
Sounds too rough for me.

18
00:03:44,614 --> 00:03:46,903
You don't care if it was your last game.

19
00:03:47,116 --> 00:03:50,651
You'll never get stomped
for your high school ball team again.

20
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:53,740
- Where's your school spirit?
- Don't know.

21
00:03:57,668 --> 00:03:58,782
You working today?

22
00:03:59,002 --> 00:04:00,829
The truck's being greased.

23
00:04:24,902 --> 00:04:28,981
See, this is what I get for betting
on my own hometown ball team.

24
00:04:30,156 --> 00:04:32,066
I ought to have better sense.

25
00:04:32,283 --> 00:04:34,739
Wouldn't hurt if you had
a better hometown.

26
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,407
Mind pointing that at the floor till I get by?

27
00:04:38,623 --> 00:04:40,745
I don't want my eye poked out.

28
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,327
Don't let Billy get too far away.

29
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:53,168
You're damn more dangerous in
a pool hall than on a football field.

30
00:04:57,474 --> 00:04:59,513
You ever heard of tackling?

31
00:05:17,075 --> 00:05:18,190
Hey, Duane!

32
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:20,735
Boy, I froze my ass last night!

33
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,286
Why can't you kids learn to tackle?

34
00:05:35,175 --> 00:05:39,220
How about taking Genevieve some
change, as you're going that way?

35
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,898
Toss me one!

36
00:05:56,946 --> 00:05:58,653
Look, Larry, they can catch.

37
00:05:58,864 --> 00:06:01,699
Feisty sons of bitches.
Wish they could tackle.

38
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,907
Or do something useful.

39
00:06:04,286 --> 00:06:07,489
Team wasn't worth
a kiss-my-ass this year.

40
00:06:16,464 --> 00:06:18,670
Fade out, Crawford. One more time.

41
00:06:22,594 --> 00:06:24,883
All right, you boys. Cut it out.

42
00:06:25,138 --> 00:06:27,925
I got enough problems
without you playing that game.

43
00:06:28,141 --> 00:06:31,142
We could've run off to Mexico
with this, you know.

44
00:06:33,897 --> 00:06:36,222
- Play the new one we heard.
- Which one?

45
00:06:36,441 --> 00:06:39,691
Down payment on breakfast.
Let someone rich play the jukebox.

46
00:06:39,902 --> 00:06:42,191
Nobody rich would eat here.

47
00:06:48,786 --> 00:06:51,111
- I ain't very hungry.
- Well, I am.

48
00:06:51,371 --> 00:06:52,949
You want the pickup first?

49
00:06:53,165 --> 00:06:55,702
I oughtn't always get it first.
It's half yours.

50
00:06:55,917 --> 00:06:57,292
- Go ahead.
- You sure?

51
00:06:57,502 --> 00:07:00,289
Yes. Anyways, I got
lots of deliveries to make.

52
00:07:00,546 --> 00:07:02,622
And I have to go clear to Ranger.

53
00:07:02,882 --> 00:07:05,799
I'll be lucky to get back for the second show.

54
00:07:50,468 --> 00:07:54,880
My goodness, Sonny. Frank oughtn't
work you so late on weekends.

55
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:56,419
That's what I tell him.

56
00:07:56,682 --> 00:08:00,015
You ain't got in in time
to see the comedy in three weeks.

57
00:08:00,227 --> 00:08:03,062
Hope you don't want popcorn.
There ain't none.

58
00:08:03,438 --> 00:08:05,395
And you missed the newsreel too.

59
00:08:05,649 --> 00:08:09,349
The main show's done started,
so I'll just charge you 30 cents.

60
00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:10,600
Thanks, Miss Mosey.

61
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:14,865
I was wondering if my daughter had
deserted us, when I heard her voice.

62
00:08:18,661 --> 00:08:20,285
Kay was our only daughter.

63
00:08:20,496 --> 00:08:24,576
A father's not supposed to have
favourites, but when it's Kay...

64
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:27,406
- You smell good.
- You like it?

65
00:08:29,212 --> 00:08:30,623
- What's that?
- An atomizer.

66
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:32,547
What'd you get? A present?

67
00:08:32,757 --> 00:08:33,788
Who from?

68
00:08:34,801 --> 00:08:35,999
Somebody.

69
00:08:42,058 --> 00:08:44,631
I decided you had a wreck.

70
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,728
What's happened?
You look different.

71
00:08:52,109 --> 00:08:53,982
- I do?
- Yeah.

72
00:08:55,237 --> 00:08:57,028
You look all lit up inside.

73
00:08:58,531 --> 00:09:00,939
You're not wearing
your usual deadpan look.

74
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,656
That "How'd I get
into this family?" look.

75
00:09:03,911 --> 00:09:05,026
Father.

76
00:09:05,246 --> 00:09:08,033
You've been taking the vitamins
Dr. Gray sent you.

77
00:09:08,249 --> 00:09:09,624
That's right.

78
00:09:23,513 --> 00:09:26,430
I guess I'll get me some of those vitamins.

79
00:09:26,974 --> 00:09:28,469
I'll get it, Delilah.

80
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:33,392
What's wrong?
She looks kind of queer.

81
00:09:34,189 --> 00:09:35,648
Guess what?

82
00:09:35,858 --> 00:09:37,138
What?

83
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,102
It's our anniversary.

84
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:42,358
What?

85
00:09:42,572 --> 00:09:45,858
We've been going steady a year tonight.

86
00:09:46,368 --> 00:09:47,565
Yeah?

87
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:51,363
Seems like a lot longer.

88
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:55,327
You should've got me
some anniversary present.

89
00:09:55,543 --> 00:09:58,460
You can have another stick of gum.
That's all I got.

90
00:09:58,671 --> 00:10:02,882
You can give me the dollar
it cost me and Marlene for the show.

91
00:10:03,133 --> 00:10:05,968
What are y'all doing back here in the dark?

92
00:10:08,388 --> 00:10:09,799
He's coming for me soon.

93
00:10:10,015 --> 00:10:11,639
I'll get your coffee.

94
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:15,717
Where'd the boys go?

95
00:10:15,937 --> 00:10:19,103
Ben had some date.
Tommy's at basketball practice.

96
00:10:19,315 --> 00:10:21,687
- Bring the coffee, please.
- Yes, Miss Banks.

97
00:10:21,901 --> 00:10:25,980
I don't see why they should get
the pickup first all the time.

98
00:10:26,697 --> 00:10:29,448
All they ever want to do is neck anyway.

99
00:10:30,951 --> 00:10:33,868
Buckley says it's not too young
for a man to marry.

100
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,569
I didn't marry your mother till I was 25.

101
00:10:42,837 --> 00:10:45,506
- Need some help, Jessie?
- Yeah, sure do.

102
00:10:45,923 --> 00:10:47,832
- So long, Sam.
- Bye.

103
00:10:48,884 --> 00:10:52,169
- Sure did like the picture.
- Well, good.

104
00:11:34,176 --> 00:11:36,465
Crack your window.
Leave the motor on.

105
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:38,386
It's just too cold in here.

106
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:53,439
Your hands are like ice.

107
00:11:54,278 --> 00:11:55,772
Put on my gloves.

108
00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:18,339
What's the matter with you?
You act plain bored.

109
00:12:19,802 --> 00:12:21,047
Quit.

110
00:12:21,262 --> 00:12:22,293
Quit.

111
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:24,969
You said this was our anniversary.

112
00:12:25,182 --> 00:12:27,221
Let's do something different.

113
00:12:27,476 --> 00:12:30,512
Well, I like that. You cheapskate.

114
00:12:30,771 --> 00:12:34,305
Didn't get me a present,
and now you want to get me pregnant.

115
00:12:34,566 --> 00:12:36,891
My God, Charlene!
It was just my hand.

116
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,818
One thing leads to another.

117
00:12:39,028 --> 00:12:41,601
My mama told me how that old stuff goes.

118
00:12:41,906 --> 00:12:45,072
We'll have plenty of time for that
when we get married.

119
00:12:45,785 --> 00:12:47,576
You wasn't no livelier than me.

120
00:12:47,786 --> 00:12:51,866
Because you ain't good-looking enough.
You ain't even got a ducktail.

121
00:12:52,082 --> 00:12:54,158
Well, anyway, I'm done late.

122
00:12:54,418 --> 00:12:56,161
Let's go on home.

123
00:12:56,419 --> 00:12:58,626
Some anniversary.

124
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,588
If that's the way you feel about it,
I'd just as soon break up.

125
00:13:03,801 --> 00:13:06,755
I don't want to spoil
no more anniversaries for you.

126
00:13:06,971 --> 00:13:09,260
That's the way nice girls get treated.

127
00:13:09,473 --> 00:13:11,549
I might've known you wasn't dependable.

128
00:13:11,767 --> 00:13:13,676
You wasn't even in the backfield.

129
00:13:13,894 --> 00:13:17,345
This jacket's got a hole,
but don't ask me to sew it for you.

130
00:13:17,606 --> 00:13:19,433
Give me back my pictures too.

131
00:13:19,691 --> 00:13:22,941
I don't want you showing them
and telling how hot I am.

132
00:13:23,153 --> 00:13:25,110
You wasn't very hot.

133
00:13:50,428 --> 00:13:52,883
I hope you ain't down about Charlene.

134
00:13:53,097 --> 00:13:56,929
- I ain't blue about her.
- What are you blue about then?

135
00:13:57,309 --> 00:13:59,468
Ain't nobody to go with in this town.

136
00:13:59,687 --> 00:14:03,055
Jacy's the only pretty girl in school,
and Duane's got her.

137
00:14:03,273 --> 00:14:05,396
I'd call that his tough luck.

138
00:14:05,984 --> 00:14:08,855
You don't have to eat so fast.
You ain't in a race.

139
00:14:09,237 --> 00:14:12,571
Jacy'd bring you more misery
than she'll ever be worth.

140
00:14:15,576 --> 00:14:17,236
Did your dad give you this?

141
00:14:17,703 --> 00:14:19,577
He needs all he's got.

142
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:23,958
Wouldn't hurt you to take something
from him once in a while.

143
00:14:24,168 --> 00:14:27,418
I don't know. You and Duane
both in a boarding house.

144
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,331
Him with the mother and you
with the father. Don't seem right.

145
00:14:32,426 --> 00:14:35,545
And your dad's taking too many pills, you know.

146
00:14:37,722 --> 00:14:39,002
But I'm no one to talk.

147
00:14:39,223 --> 00:14:41,465
I never got on with Mama.
I still don't.

148
00:14:41,684 --> 00:14:44,140
I hear Dan's going back to work soon.

149
00:14:44,353 --> 00:14:46,595
I guess you'll be quitting before long.

150
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:51,854
We got $4000 worth of doctor bills to pay.

151
00:14:52,778 --> 00:14:56,727
I will probably be making
cheeseburgers for your grandkids.

152
00:15:38,112 --> 00:15:42,987
What are my chances this morning
of interesting you kids in John Keats?

153
00:15:43,241 --> 00:15:44,486
None at all.

154
00:15:48,788 --> 00:15:50,247
Joe Bob?

155
00:15:50,623 --> 00:15:53,197
I read that poem of his about the nightingale.

156
00:15:53,418 --> 00:15:55,209
I didn't think it was so good.

157
00:15:55,419 --> 00:15:58,089
Sounded like he wanted to be a nightingale.

158
00:15:58,381 --> 00:16:02,248
I don't think he wanted
to be a nightingale, Joe Bob.

159
00:16:02,509 --> 00:16:04,632
Maybe he just wanted to be immortal.

160
00:16:04,887 --> 00:16:08,635
All you have to do to be immortal
is lead a good Christian life.

161
00:16:08,849 --> 00:16:11,304
Anyone can do it if they love the Lord.

162
00:16:11,685 --> 00:16:14,354
Well, maybe so, Joe Bob. Maybe so.

163
00:16:14,729 --> 00:16:16,852
Here now, let me read you this:

164
00:16:18,274 --> 00:16:21,892
When old age shall this generation waste

165
00:16:22,153 --> 00:16:25,070
Thou shalt remain in midst of other woe

166
00:16:25,322 --> 00:16:30,743
Than ours, a friend to man,
to whom thou say'st:

167
00:16:31,203 --> 00:16:35,366
"Beauty is truth, truth beauty,"...
that is all

168
00:16:35,624 --> 00:16:39,621
Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.

169
00:16:39,836 --> 00:16:41,745
Run, you little pissants, run!

170
00:16:42,004 --> 00:16:45,788
Tough it out!
You gotta be men like the rest of us.

171
00:16:46,008 --> 00:16:49,507
None of you pretty enough to be women.
Here, Joe Bob.

172
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,637
Quit flapping your arms.
You look like a damn goose.

173
00:16:53,098 --> 00:16:55,719
Even a preacher's boy ought to be in shape.

174
00:16:55,934 --> 00:16:58,010
What kind of female will you ever get?

175
00:16:59,062 --> 00:17:00,307
Tough it out!

176
00:17:02,607 --> 00:17:04,434
Run, you little pissants.

177
00:17:05,985 --> 00:17:08,061
All right, off the court.

178
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:13,612
If y'all didn't jack off so much,
maybe you could stay in shape.

179
00:17:13,826 --> 00:17:15,486
Come here a minute, Sonny.

180
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:21,493
You do me a favour, and I'll do you one.

181
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,161
Sure, coach.

182
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:28,416
My old lady's got to go to the doctor tomorrow.

183
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:30,837
You know women.
Always something wrong.

184
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,081
I guess.

185
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,922
Take it from me. Anyway, I don't
have time to drive her.

186
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:41,386
Now, if you'll do this for me,
I'll get you out of civics class.

187
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:44,645
I'll be glad to.
The best offer I've had all day.

188
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:49,148
Tell her you got to get back for
practice so she won't stay too long.

189
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,607
I've got enough bills to pay already.

190
00:17:55,990 --> 00:18:00,984
"Know what the trouble is with you?
You ain't got no school spirit."

191
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:50,074
You need a haircut.

192
00:18:55,295 --> 00:18:58,166
Come on, Jimmie Sue.
We're hungry over here too.

193
00:18:58,381 --> 00:19:01,501
I'm coming. Hold your horses!

194
00:19:06,931 --> 00:19:09,552
Better watch it.
Here comes your mama.

195
00:19:19,818 --> 00:19:21,976
We're having supper at home tonight.

196
00:19:22,237 --> 00:19:24,728
I expect you there in 15 minutes, you hear?

197
00:19:24,948 --> 00:19:28,151
Okay, Mama.
I was just giving the boys a ride.

198
00:19:52,473 --> 00:19:55,640
Here's a tune that's been
on the hit list for some weeks.

199
00:19:55,852 --> 00:19:56,931
Tell us the name.

200
00:19:59,897 --> 00:20:01,095
What is it?

201
00:20:01,982 --> 00:20:03,013
What is it, huh?

202
00:20:03,233 --> 00:20:05,605
- "Shrimp Boats."
- You got it!

203
00:20:08,488 --> 00:20:10,944
Very good, Thomas.
You were in on that too.

204
00:20:11,158 --> 00:20:13,446
There's $ 120. We're going along fine.

205
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:16,067
Now we come to City Limits.
This is...

206
00:20:29,133 --> 00:20:30,627
Guess you hate me tonight.

207
00:20:30,843 --> 00:20:34,710
I love you, but I love Duane too.
Even if you don't like it.

208
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:37,966
I don't care. I'd just hate to see you marry him.

209
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:40,141
You wouldn't be rich anymore.

210
00:20:40,351 --> 00:20:41,929
I don't care about money.

211
00:20:42,145 --> 00:20:43,687
You're pretty stupid then.

212
00:20:43,896 --> 00:20:47,479
You married Daddy when he was poor,
and he got rich, didn't he?

213
00:20:47,692 --> 00:20:50,313
Scared your daddy into getting rich, beautiful.

214
00:20:50,528 --> 00:20:53,197
If Daddy could do it, Duane could too.

215
00:20:53,405 --> 00:20:55,896
Not married to you.
You're not scary enough.

216
00:20:56,116 --> 00:20:59,319
You're rich and miserable.
I don't want to be like you.

217
00:20:59,536 --> 00:21:01,160
Not much danger of that.

218
00:21:03,289 --> 00:21:04,700
- You slept with him?
- Mama!

219
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:07,241
Go to the doctor and arrange something...

220
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:11,504
...so you don't have to worry
about babies. You must be careful.

221
00:21:11,714 --> 00:21:15,546
But it's a sin unless you're married.
You know I wouldn't do that.

222
00:21:16,135 --> 00:21:17,759
Don't be so mealy-mouthed!

223
00:21:18,011 --> 00:21:19,671
I thought if you slept with him...

224
00:21:19,888 --> 00:21:22,805
...you might find there isn't
anything magic about him.

225
00:21:23,016 --> 00:21:25,139
Then we can send you to a good school...

226
00:21:25,352 --> 00:21:26,632
I don't want to leave.

227
00:21:26,853 --> 00:21:29,807
Why can't I stay
and go to college in Wichita Falls?

228
00:21:30,023 --> 00:21:31,102
Because.

229
00:21:31,316 --> 00:21:34,269
Everything is flat and empty here.

230
00:21:34,527 --> 00:21:36,104
And nothing to do!

231
00:21:36,362 --> 00:21:37,737
Can I have some of that?

232
00:21:37,988 --> 00:21:40,147
Help yourself. Don't you have any?

233
00:21:40,366 --> 00:21:43,781
Yeah, but I feel like smelling good right now.

234
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:47,990
Don't you ever feel like
doing anything right now?

235
00:21:53,169 --> 00:21:55,126
Leave your face just like that.

236
00:21:55,338 --> 00:21:57,544
All you need is a little eyebrow pencil.

237
00:22:04,722 --> 00:22:06,299
Okay. Good night.

238
00:22:10,018 --> 00:22:14,596
Just remember, beautiful, everything
gets old if you do it often enough.

239
00:22:14,814 --> 00:22:18,894
So if you want to find out about
monotony real quick, marry Duane.

240
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:21,897
Number one hit in the country,
right here on KTRN...

241
00:22:22,113 --> 00:22:24,354
...your mutual station in Wichita Falls.

242
00:22:24,573 --> 00:22:26,899
Our old friend Hank Williams wrote that.

243
00:22:30,662 --> 00:22:33,580
You're with us on Strike it Rich.

244
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:38,452
I'd like to remind you that
we're on television every day.

245
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:42,881
That's right, Monday through Friday
at 11:30 a.m., New York time.

246
00:22:43,132 --> 00:22:46,252
Also, every morning,
we're on radio on another network.

247
00:22:46,469 --> 00:22:47,963
Check your paper for times.

248
00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:52,259
And every Wednesday night at 9:00
right back here on television again.

249
00:22:53,934 --> 00:22:56,472
For tickets, all you have to do is write to:

250
00:22:56,687 --> 00:22:59,604
Strike it Rich Box 500, Grand Central Annex...

251
00:22:59,815 --> 00:23:00,846
Hello.

252
00:23:01,066 --> 00:23:03,604
- Abilene, you asleep?
- No.

253
00:23:03,818 --> 00:23:05,478
Feel like company?

254
00:23:06,738 --> 00:23:10,189
I thought I'd drive out,
see how my well is coming.

255
00:23:10,449 --> 00:23:13,984
Drill hard.
You're better at oil wells anyway.

256
00:23:52,822 --> 00:23:54,649
Hello, Sonny. What you want?

257
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:57,409
Coach said you need a driver.

258
00:24:00,579 --> 00:24:01,908
Didn't he tell you?

259
00:24:02,415 --> 00:24:06,282
No, he didn't mention it.
I thought he'd drive me himself.

260
00:24:06,585 --> 00:24:08,578
I guess he just couldn't get off.

261
00:24:10,005 --> 00:24:12,044
Let me just get the radio.

262
00:24:48,332 --> 00:24:49,708
Is it something bad?

263
00:24:50,626 --> 00:24:51,657
No.

264
00:24:52,836 --> 00:24:54,247
It's something...

265
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,339
...very...

266
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,082
Thank you.

267
00:25:34,417 --> 00:25:35,959
Here's the keys.

268
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:43,882
I guess I'd better be getting back to school.

269
00:25:46,261 --> 00:25:48,337
It was nice of you to drive me.

270
00:25:48,555 --> 00:25:51,390
Well, it beats sitting through civics, ma'am.

271
00:26:07,072 --> 00:26:10,239
Wouldn't you like to come in and have a soda?

272
00:26:10,492 --> 00:26:13,065
If you can stand me for a few more minutes.

273
00:26:17,499 --> 00:26:19,538
I hate these northers.

274
00:26:40,312 --> 00:26:42,600
Would you prefer milk?
Sit at the table.

275
00:26:43,314 --> 00:26:45,390
Or you can go now if you want.

276
00:26:45,608 --> 00:26:49,558
I was just scared to be alone.
I'm sorry I made you come in.

277
00:26:50,196 --> 00:26:51,987
I'll take a Dr Pepper.

278
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,491
You'll never forgive me, I know.

279
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:54,337
Go on. You don't have to stay any longer.

280
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:57,379
Thank you for the Dr Pepper.

281
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:01,588
I guess you'll be glad
when basketball season's over.

282
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:04,347
Why?

283
00:28:05,057 --> 00:28:07,465
Coach probably don't get to stay home much...

284
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:09,926
...during football and basketball season.

285
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:15,431
My God, you don't know
a thing about it, do you?

286
00:28:25,409 --> 00:28:27,568
You better go on to basketball practice.

287
00:28:30,206 --> 00:28:32,163
Thanks for the Dr Pepper.

288
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,199
- Hi, Jacy.
- Oh, hi.

289
00:29:12,411 --> 00:29:13,906
Duane coming?

290
00:29:14,538 --> 00:29:18,999
- You know Bobby Sheen at Wichita Falls?
- I met him at the country club.

291
00:29:19,376 --> 00:29:22,211
He's having this midnight swimming party tonight.

292
00:29:22,421 --> 00:29:24,959
- You want to run over there with me?
- I can't.

293
00:29:25,173 --> 00:29:26,798
You hear about the last one?

294
00:29:27,008 --> 00:29:30,543
His folks were gone to Miami,
and everybody swam naked.

295
00:29:30,762 --> 00:29:33,549
His folks are gone again, so it'll be pretty wild.

296
00:29:33,765 --> 00:29:36,682
Sure wish you could come.
Bobby has great parties.

297
00:29:37,018 --> 00:29:40,221
A lot of kids from the club gonna be there.

298
00:29:44,233 --> 00:29:46,272
Gee, Lester, I'd like to go.

299
00:29:47,486 --> 00:29:50,059
I'll have a big problem with Duane, though.

300
00:29:50,739 --> 00:29:53,905
Well, don't go off without me.
Maybe I can.

301
00:30:01,249 --> 00:30:02,280
Hi, Duane.

302
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,124
What did Lester want?

303
00:30:04,335 --> 00:30:06,623
Oh, Lester. He's such a bore.

304
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:16,214
- Hey, Abilene.
- What do you say, buddy?

305
00:30:20,475 --> 00:30:21,637
Hey there.

306
00:30:25,021 --> 00:30:26,301
Merry Christmas.

307
00:30:26,522 --> 00:30:30,354
This is Jackie Lee French.
This is Lois Farrow, my boss's wife.

308
00:30:30,609 --> 00:30:32,898
What do you mean, kissing her like that?

309
00:30:33,112 --> 00:30:36,860
- I ought to slap your face.
- Well, why don't you just kiss my ass?

310
00:30:37,074 --> 00:30:39,066
I never come to referee no fight.

311
00:30:39,284 --> 00:30:41,857
Well, good then. Come dance with me.

312
00:30:42,329 --> 00:30:44,819
Get yourself a drink, honey.
I'll be back.

313
00:30:52,213 --> 00:30:53,588
Hi, Ruth.

314
00:31:35,795 --> 00:31:38,120
Wait for me outside.

315
00:31:49,433 --> 00:31:51,924
...a thousand barrels of oil a day.

316
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:03,352
It's too hot in here.
Let's go outside.

317
00:32:03,571 --> 00:32:05,777
I don't want drunks tromping on my feet.

318
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:07,899
I have something for you anyway.

319
00:32:08,284 --> 00:32:09,398
- Hey, Sonny.
- Hey.

320
00:32:09,618 --> 00:32:10,816
Hi.

321
00:32:16,333 --> 00:32:17,708
Hi, Sonny.

322
00:32:18,168 --> 00:32:19,330
Hi, Dad.

323
00:32:19,544 --> 00:32:21,038
How you doing?

324
00:32:22,505 --> 00:32:23,964
Okay.

325
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:26,049
That's good.

326
00:32:31,138 --> 00:32:32,301
See you.

327
00:32:32,973 --> 00:32:34,171
Sure.

328
00:32:39,729 --> 00:32:41,603
You mean my Christmas present.

329
00:32:41,856 --> 00:32:45,806
I haven't had time to get you
anything yet. I had no time to shop.

330
00:32:46,069 --> 00:32:48,441
Hope you like it.
I saved for six months.

331
00:32:50,072 --> 00:32:51,946
Oh, it's just beautiful.

332
00:32:52,158 --> 00:32:54,565
It's just what I've been wanting.

333
00:32:54,785 --> 00:32:57,537
You're so sweet,
spending all that money on me.

334
00:32:59,665 --> 00:33:02,334
You're so sexy, Duane.

335
00:33:02,959 --> 00:33:05,450
I wish I didn't have to leave you tonight.

336
00:33:05,879 --> 00:33:06,910
Well, you don't.

337
00:33:07,172 --> 00:33:09,923
I do too. I could just kill my mother.

338
00:33:10,925 --> 00:33:15,468
She made me promise to go to a swim
party in Wichita with Lester Marlow.

339
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:19,463
- His folks are rich. Don't be mad.
- I ain't mad, but goddamn it!

340
00:33:19,725 --> 00:33:22,394
It's all Lester's fault.
He keeps asking Mama.

341
00:33:22,603 --> 00:33:25,888
- I want to stay with the man I love.
- Goddamn...

342
00:34:18,446 --> 00:34:20,771
No, Duane! I gotta go. I gotta go.

343
00:34:43,762 --> 00:34:45,505
Why you asking my girl out?

344
00:34:45,763 --> 00:34:48,254
- Turn me loose!
- When you're ready to fight.

345
00:34:48,474 --> 00:34:49,470
Let's have it out!

346
00:34:51,435 --> 00:34:55,848
Here, knock off that shit, boys.
This is the Christmas season.

347
00:34:56,106 --> 00:34:57,435
Run along, Wichita.

348
00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:00,983
I can't stand here all night
protecting your shoeshine.

349
00:35:08,535 --> 00:35:12,449
I don't know what to do about him.
He's so crazy about me.

350
00:35:12,747 --> 00:35:15,913
Nothing against Duane,
but that's a roughneck for you.

351
00:35:16,125 --> 00:35:18,663
They aren't sophisticated
about these things.

352
00:35:20,337 --> 00:35:22,460
Well, merry Christmas.

353
00:35:23,132 --> 00:35:25,801
Come in and let's have some punch, boys.

354
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,054
Hi, Sonny.

355
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:38,849
Oh, hi.

356
00:35:39,063 --> 00:35:40,261
Want to help me?

357
00:35:40,481 --> 00:35:41,856
Okay.

358
00:35:52,701 --> 00:35:55,488
You're not dancing.
Don't you have a girlfriend?

359
00:35:55,704 --> 00:35:58,241
I did. We broke up a couple of months ago.

360
00:35:58,498 --> 00:36:00,621
Oh? Why?

361
00:36:00,875 --> 00:36:02,334
Mind my asking?

362
00:36:02,543 --> 00:36:05,034
I was going with Charlene Duggs.

363
00:36:05,588 --> 00:36:08,754
She thought I got fresh with her.
I never did, really.

364
00:36:09,049 --> 00:36:12,833
We broke up because we didn't like
each other much to begin with.

365
00:36:13,262 --> 00:36:15,219
I hope you're not sad about it.

366
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:18,301
I don't think Charlene's
near nice enough for you.

367
00:36:18,517 --> 00:36:20,176
I didn't see you dancing.

368
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:22,933
No, I don't dance much.

369
00:37:11,357 --> 00:37:14,643
Will you drive me
to the clinic again next week?

370
00:37:14,861 --> 00:37:16,319
Oh, you bet.

371
00:37:25,078 --> 00:37:26,905
We better not dawdle here.

372
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:41,541
Bobby.

373
00:37:42,303 --> 00:37:44,379
Hey, look! New victims!

374
00:37:47,057 --> 00:37:48,635
Hi, Jacy.

375
00:37:50,269 --> 00:37:54,052
Glad you made it. We're dressed
informally, as you can see.

376
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:56,643
You know Annie-Annie.

377
00:37:56,858 --> 00:37:58,566
You want to join the club?

378
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:00,516
Sure.

379
00:38:00,737 --> 00:38:04,022
You gotta get undressed
out there on the diving board.

380
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,565
So everybody gets to watch.

381
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:09,530
- We all did the first time.
- That's the rule.

382
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:11,453
Yeah, I did it last Easter.

383
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:13,241
Okay?

384
00:38:13,665 --> 00:38:14,697
Okay.

385
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:16,992
Everybody out for the strip show!

386
00:38:20,797 --> 00:38:22,208
Look out.

387
00:38:43,777 --> 00:38:46,481
Don't pay attention to Sandy.
He's my brother.

388
00:38:46,696 --> 00:38:49,531
If he gooses you, I'll make him go to bed.

389
00:38:52,869 --> 00:38:55,620
Goodness. I hope I don't fall off this thing.

390
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:57,787
Sandy can fish you out if you do.

391
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,234
Duane, been looking for you.
Where's Jacy?

392
00:41:04,491 --> 00:41:07,658
Don't remind him.
We just got him quiet. Want a drink?

393
00:41:07,869 --> 00:41:09,992
- Where'd you get it?
- In a guy's car.

394
00:41:10,205 --> 00:41:12,363
- He weren't looking.
- Let's do something.

395
00:41:12,582 --> 00:41:14,705
Why don't we hunt up some pussy?

396
00:41:14,917 --> 00:41:18,333
You wouldn't know what to do
with it if we found some.

397
00:41:18,546 --> 00:41:19,577
What happened?

398
00:41:19,797 --> 00:41:22,798
Lester took his girl to a swimming party.

399
00:41:23,092 --> 00:41:24,965
Let's all go out and get a fuck.

400
00:41:25,177 --> 00:41:28,712
I know where's a heifer.
It belongs to my Uncle Hank.

401
00:41:28,972 --> 00:41:30,716
Why the hell not?

402
00:41:30,974 --> 00:41:33,430
- A heifer beats nothing.
- Pussy's pussy.

403
00:41:33,643 --> 00:41:35,351
I don't want no heifer.

404
00:41:36,271 --> 00:41:41,146
- We ought to buy Billy a piece of ass.
- We oughtn't let him die a virgin.

405
00:41:41,901 --> 00:41:44,024
Mama says idiot kids don't live long.

406
00:41:44,236 --> 00:41:46,359
He ain't no idiot. He just don't talk.

407
00:41:46,572 --> 00:41:47,947
Bet he's still a virgin.

408
00:41:48,157 --> 00:41:51,157
Hey, we ought to fix him up with Jimmie Sue.

409
00:41:51,577 --> 00:41:55,621
- It'd make no difference to Billy.
- We shouldn't try anything like that.

410
00:41:55,831 --> 00:41:58,404
Why not? It wouldn't cost us
more than $1.50.

411
00:41:58,625 --> 00:42:00,950
If that's all, we should get her ourselves.

412
00:42:01,169 --> 00:42:03,494
Shit! A heifer's better than Jimmie Sue.

413
00:42:03,963 --> 00:42:06,964
Get the stupid thing in here.
I ain't got all night.

414
00:42:07,174 --> 00:42:09,712
Come on, let's get those pants off, boys.

415
00:42:11,554 --> 00:42:15,931
- You won't be a virgin much longer.
- We're gonna get you laid.

416
00:42:18,977 --> 00:42:21,598
Grab on now. Come on, do your job.

417
00:42:21,855 --> 00:42:23,728
Get her, Billy-boy!

418
00:42:28,903 --> 00:42:30,694
This is the dumbest thing!

419
00:42:30,905 --> 00:42:32,613
He don't even know what to do!

420
00:42:32,823 --> 00:42:33,855
It worked for me.

421
00:42:34,075 --> 00:42:35,617
Put it to her, boy!

422
00:42:35,826 --> 00:42:38,531
- Get her, Billy.
- Come on, screw it to her, boy.

423
00:42:38,746 --> 00:42:40,405
Stop that yelling out there.

424
00:42:40,622 --> 00:42:42,282
It ain't even in!

425
00:42:42,499 --> 00:42:43,910
Goddamn...

426
00:42:44,459 --> 00:42:46,582
Goddamn, you stupid little thing!

427
00:42:46,795 --> 00:42:49,202
Couldn't even wait.
Look at this mess!

428
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,724
You okay, Billy?

429
00:43:02,935 --> 00:43:04,345
You all right?

430
00:43:15,405 --> 00:43:19,188
Well, now I know.
Idiots as bad as Mexicans.

431
00:43:19,408 --> 00:43:22,160
Don't bother me no more for that crazy thing.

432
00:43:22,369 --> 00:43:26,070
Wouldn't mess with him again
for less than three and a half.

433
00:43:55,859 --> 00:43:58,266
Which one of you bloodied his nose?

434
00:43:58,653 --> 00:44:02,733
I told you not to fight with Billy.
He don't understand about fighting.

435
00:44:03,324 --> 00:44:04,355
What happened?

436
00:44:04,575 --> 00:44:07,825
- It weren't none of us, Sam.
- No, it was Jimmie Sue.

437
00:44:08,871 --> 00:44:11,872
Jimmie Sue?
How'd he get messed up with her?

438
00:44:12,374 --> 00:44:16,419
We bought him a piece of ass.
Thought he was tired of being a virgin.

439
00:44:16,628 --> 00:44:20,079
She got mad about something
and bloodied his nose.

440
00:44:22,551 --> 00:44:24,210
You boys get on out of here.

441
00:44:24,427 --> 00:44:26,965
I don't want to have no more to do with you.

442
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,301
Scaring a poor, unfortunate creature like Billy...

443
00:44:30,516 --> 00:44:32,758
...just so you could have a few laughs.

444
00:44:32,977 --> 00:44:36,595
I've been around
that trashy behaviour all my life.

445
00:44:36,981 --> 00:44:39,471
I'm getting tired of putting up with it.

446
00:44:39,983 --> 00:44:42,688
You can stay out of this pool hall, my café...

447
00:44:42,903 --> 00:44:45,144
...and my picture show too.

448
00:44:46,156 --> 00:44:48,907
I don't want no more of your business.

449
00:44:49,576 --> 00:44:53,620
We didn't mean for anything
bad to happen, Sam. We...

450
00:44:54,539 --> 00:44:57,539
You didn't even have
the decency to wash his face.

451
00:45:20,021 --> 00:45:23,306
We're his best customers.
He can't run us off.

452
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,640
Can he?

453
00:45:37,245 --> 00:45:40,910
Lucky I fell asleep. I'd hate
not being able to shoot no pool.

454
00:45:57,848 --> 00:45:59,555
You sure he won't come?

455
00:45:59,766 --> 00:46:03,514
You know he won't.
He's starting basketball practice.

456
00:47:54,331 --> 00:47:55,706
It's all right.

457
00:49:19,202 --> 00:49:21,408
I'm sorry I cried.

458
00:49:22,747 --> 00:49:25,154
Just scared, I guess.

459
00:49:26,542 --> 00:49:28,700
He ain't gonna come.

460
00:49:29,253 --> 00:49:31,660
They're probably running plays right now.

461
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:34,086
No, not scared of that.

462
00:49:35,967 --> 00:49:38,968
Scared I could never do this, I guess.

463
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:44,131
Can't seem to do anything
without crying about it.

464
00:49:46,352 --> 00:49:48,179
How could you like me?

465
00:49:48,521 --> 00:49:50,229
I like you.

466
00:49:53,233 --> 00:49:54,692
I'm glad.

467
00:51:51,302 --> 00:51:54,006
Come on in. I ain't gonna
throw bottles at you.

468
00:51:58,016 --> 00:52:00,507
What've you been doing?
You lost weight.

469
00:52:00,769 --> 00:52:03,639
Ain't had any of
your cheeseburgers in weeks.

470
00:52:03,938 --> 00:52:06,061
Come on. I'll fix you one.

471
00:52:06,774 --> 00:52:10,143
Even though that wasn't a nice thing
y'all done to Billy.

472
00:52:10,361 --> 00:52:12,188
You can't blame Sam.

473
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:14,488
- Was that your idea?
- No.

474
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:15,771
- Duane's?
- Huh?

475
00:52:16,033 --> 00:52:18,025
He was there, wasn't he?

476
00:52:18,702 --> 00:52:21,371
He didn't have the decency to own up to it.

477
00:52:24,499 --> 00:52:27,619
Don't worry, I won't tell on him.
I should, though.

478
00:52:28,837 --> 00:52:30,496
Sure smells good.

479
00:52:30,838 --> 00:52:32,712
One thing I know for sure.

480
00:52:32,924 --> 00:52:36,542
You can't sneeze here without
somebody offering a handkerchief.

481
00:52:36,761 --> 00:52:38,670
- What you mean?
- Nothing.

482
00:52:39,597 --> 00:52:43,261
It's an awful small town
for any kind of carrying on.

483
00:52:44,017 --> 00:52:45,761
Don't forget to put onions on.

484
00:52:46,728 --> 00:52:49,053
And some people got a lot of guns.

485
00:52:53,401 --> 00:52:55,939
All right, you don't need my advice anyway.

486
00:52:56,154 --> 00:52:59,736
Why don't you go play a record?
These'll be done in a minute.

487
00:53:28,851 --> 00:53:31,389
Just come in to say hello to Genevieve.

488
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:38,108
Sonny.

489
00:53:39,569 --> 00:53:41,396
Food's getting cold.

490
00:53:51,914 --> 00:53:53,289
What you grinning about?

491
00:53:53,499 --> 00:53:56,286
Chicken-fry me a steak.
Try to use meat this time.

492
00:54:04,801 --> 00:54:07,636
I heard about the ball game last night.

493
00:54:08,137 --> 00:54:11,091
121 to 14.

494
00:54:11,349 --> 00:54:13,341
Must be pretty near a record.

495
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:17,478
Sam.

496
00:54:17,730 --> 00:54:19,307
I'm sorry.

497
00:54:21,650 --> 00:54:24,141
I reckon y'all need glasses.

498
00:54:35,163 --> 00:54:37,321
Now, hold still.

499
00:54:38,332 --> 00:54:40,455
Want some more cookies?

500
00:54:40,876 --> 00:54:43,581
- More milk?
- I'm full.

501
00:54:53,471 --> 00:54:55,879
How come you've stayed with the coach?

502
00:54:56,099 --> 00:54:57,807
You don't like him much.

503
00:54:58,059 --> 00:55:00,550
I wasn't brought up to leave a husband.

504
00:55:00,770 --> 00:55:02,561
I guess that's why.

505
00:55:02,897 --> 00:55:05,055
Maybe I was just scared to.

506
00:55:06,150 --> 00:55:09,104
I never noticed how ugly this room is.

507
00:55:09,319 --> 00:55:11,111
What's your favourite colour?

508
00:55:11,321 --> 00:55:12,566
I don't know. Blue.

509
00:55:12,781 --> 00:55:15,698
- Maybe I'll repaper it.
- Why'd you marry him?

510
00:55:15,951 --> 00:55:18,239
I don't know.
My mother didn't like him.

511
00:55:18,453 --> 00:55:20,077
Maybe that was it.

512
00:55:20,747 --> 00:55:22,454
Well, I was 20 years old.

513
00:55:22,707 --> 00:55:26,751
I thought hairy-chested
football coaches were about it.

514
00:55:27,086 --> 00:55:29,624
I'm gonna buy us a new quilt.

515
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:31,375
A blue one.

516
00:55:32,883 --> 00:55:35,374
What you think he'd do if he found us?

517
00:55:35,594 --> 00:55:37,385
Shoot us, probably.

518
00:55:37,971 --> 00:55:41,340
He's always glad to have an excuse
to use his deer rifle.

519
00:55:58,991 --> 00:56:03,652
I thought you boys wanted to fish.
Keep an eye on them corks, Billy.

520
00:56:09,584 --> 00:56:12,538
I don't think there's anything
here except turtles.

521
00:56:12,753 --> 00:56:15,624
That's what I like about it, tell you the truth.

522
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:18,046
- Want to try one?
- Sure.

523
00:56:21,178 --> 00:56:24,095
I never liked to clean fish or eat them either.

524
00:56:24,306 --> 00:56:26,975
You spend half your time picking out bone.

525
00:56:29,477 --> 00:56:32,098
I just come out here to get a little scenery.

526
00:56:32,313 --> 00:56:34,721
Too pretty a day to spend in town.

527
00:56:38,819 --> 00:56:41,939
You wouldn't believe
how this country's changed.

528
00:56:45,242 --> 00:56:48,693
First time I seen it,
there wasn't a mesquite tree on it.

529
00:56:48,954 --> 00:56:50,946
Or a prickly pear neither.

530
00:56:51,456 --> 00:56:53,614
I used to own this land, you know.

531
00:56:55,168 --> 00:56:57,741
First time I watered a horse at this tank...

532
00:56:58,004 --> 00:57:00,210
...was more than 40 years ago.

533
00:57:02,174 --> 00:57:04,712
I reckon the reason I drag you out here is...

534
00:57:04,969 --> 00:57:09,132
...I'm as sentimental as the next
fellow when it comes to old times.

535
00:57:13,894 --> 00:57:15,471
Old times.

536
00:57:16,229 --> 00:57:19,146
I brought a young lady swimming out here once...

537
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,433
...more than 20 years ago.

538
00:57:24,487 --> 00:57:27,441
It was after my wife had lost her mind.

539
00:57:27,698 --> 00:57:29,358
And my boys was dead.

540
00:57:32,870 --> 00:57:36,570
Me and this young lady was pretty wild, I guess.

541
00:57:37,541 --> 00:57:39,332
In pretty deep.

542
00:57:42,337 --> 00:57:46,548
We used to come here on horseback
and swim without no bathing suits.

543
00:57:49,719 --> 00:57:53,502
One day she wanted to swim
the horses across this tank.

544
00:57:53,764 --> 00:57:57,014
Kind of a crazy thing to do,
but we done it anyway.

545
00:57:58,018 --> 00:58:01,351
She bet me a silver dollar
she could beat me across.

546
00:58:02,314 --> 00:58:03,772
She did.

547
00:58:05,275 --> 00:58:08,644
This old horse I was riding
didn't want to take the water.

548
00:58:08,861 --> 00:58:12,526
But she was always looking
for something to do like that.

549
00:58:13,741 --> 00:58:15,449
Something wild.

550
00:58:17,578 --> 00:58:20,662
I bet she's still got that silver dollar.

551
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,041
Whatever happened to her?

552
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:28,294
She growed up.

553
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:31,545
She was just a girl then, really.

554
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:35,878
Let me help you with that.

555
00:58:37,221 --> 00:58:40,257
Why didn't you ever marry her
after your wife died?

556
00:58:42,601 --> 00:58:44,428
She was already married.

557
00:58:49,775 --> 00:58:53,108
Her and her husband was young
and miserable with one another...

558
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:55,561
...like so many young married folks are.

559
00:58:56,281 --> 00:58:59,032
I thought they'd change with some age...

560
00:58:59,409 --> 00:59:01,318
...but it didn't turn out that way.

561
00:59:01,536 --> 00:59:04,323
- Is being married always so miserable?
- Not really.

562
00:59:04,830 --> 00:59:07,238
About 80 percent of the time, I guess.

563
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:13,210
We ought to go to
a real fishing tank next year.

564
00:59:13,463 --> 00:59:16,832
It don't do to think
about things like that too much.

565
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:21,677
If she was here,
I'd probably be just as crazy now...

566
00:59:21,930 --> 00:59:24,716
...as I was then in about five minutes.

567
00:59:25,349 --> 00:59:27,093
Ain't that ridiculous?

568
00:59:29,478 --> 00:59:31,435
No, it ain't really.

569
00:59:31,689 --> 00:59:35,900
Being crazy about a woman like her
is always the right thing to do.

570
00:59:37,903 --> 00:59:41,568
Being a decrepit old bag of bones,
that's what's ridiculous.

571
00:59:41,948 --> 00:59:43,526
Getting old.

572
01:00:35,665 --> 01:00:37,492
I'm glad I wasn't on fire.

573
01:00:37,750 --> 01:00:41,083
I'd have burned to death
before you got one button undone.

574
01:00:41,295 --> 01:00:43,501
I'm going to get a drink of water.

575
01:00:51,388 --> 01:00:54,721
I wondered where you went.
Annie-Annie asleep?

576
01:00:55,058 --> 01:00:56,433
Yeah.

577
01:01:11,448 --> 01:01:12,479
Nice.

578
01:01:12,699 --> 01:01:13,944
You a virgin?

579
01:01:15,327 --> 01:01:16,702
Guess I am.

580
01:01:17,913 --> 01:01:18,944
Too bad.

581
01:01:20,457 --> 01:01:23,291
- I don't want to be, though.
- I don't blame you.

582
01:01:24,002 --> 01:01:25,745
Come see me when you're not.

583
01:01:50,651 --> 01:01:54,400
Why don't we just go someplace?
I'm sick and tired of this town.

584
01:01:54,613 --> 01:01:56,855
- You're my only friend.
- Go and stay gone?

585
01:01:57,074 --> 01:01:59,197
Except Jacy. No, I don't know.

586
01:02:00,369 --> 01:02:03,204
Hey, we go to Mexico.
Be back sometime Monday.

587
01:02:03,413 --> 01:02:06,663
- Would the pickup make it?
- Yeah. How much money you got?

588
01:02:06,875 --> 01:02:08,037
Thirty bucks, about.

589
01:02:08,293 --> 01:02:11,044
Well, I got 40.
We can make it on that. Come on!

590
01:02:13,172 --> 01:02:14,370
You guys want...

591
01:02:14,966 --> 01:02:16,923
- Where you going?
- Mexico.

592
01:02:17,134 --> 01:02:18,083
Where?

593
01:02:24,766 --> 01:02:28,182
Better come with us, Sam.
We're headed for the valley.

594
01:02:28,562 --> 01:02:30,353
- Where did you say?
- Mexico.

595
01:02:30,563 --> 01:02:32,852
- It's about the wildest.
- All the way down.

596
01:02:33,483 --> 01:02:37,480
You going all the way to Mexico
tonight in this old heap of junk?

597
01:02:37,737 --> 01:02:38,982
My God!

598
01:02:39,238 --> 01:02:42,358
Reckon the town will get along
without us till Monday?

599
01:02:42,575 --> 01:02:43,570
I reckon.

600
01:02:43,784 --> 01:02:46,536
If I was young enough, I'd go with you.

601
01:02:46,912 --> 01:02:49,237
- Need any money?
- No, we got plenty.

602
01:02:49,957 --> 01:02:53,491
Well, you'd better take some
for some insurance.

603
01:02:54,169 --> 01:02:57,419
Take money below that border,
it sort of melts sometimes.

604
01:02:57,630 --> 01:02:58,911
Thanks, Sam.

605
01:02:59,716 --> 01:03:02,467
Try not to drink too much of that buggy water.

606
01:03:02,677 --> 01:03:05,512
We'll just drink beer and tequila.

607
01:03:06,305 --> 01:03:10,089
You catch the clap, you'll wish
you hadn't drunk nothing.

608
01:03:22,570 --> 01:03:23,768
Oh, well.

609
01:03:24,489 --> 01:03:25,651
We'll see you.

610
01:03:25,907 --> 01:03:27,615
- Thank you.
- So long.

611
01:03:59,146 --> 01:04:00,557
Hey, wake up!

612
01:04:00,939 --> 01:04:02,054
We're back.

613
01:04:04,067 --> 01:04:06,985
My stomach don't feel so good.
Got any more Tums?

614
01:04:07,529 --> 01:04:10,944
You ate them all
before we got to San Antonio.

615
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:15,782
Genevieve will have something.
My stomach don't feel so good.

616
01:04:18,581 --> 01:04:19,576
Closed.

617
01:04:20,166 --> 01:04:21,624
Closed?

618
01:04:23,710 --> 01:04:25,869
I ain't never seen her closed before.

619
01:04:26,088 --> 01:04:28,164
No, not even for Christmas.

620
01:04:29,633 --> 01:04:33,048
Maybe Sam will have something.
I'm sick.

621
01:04:55,782 --> 01:04:57,525
Well, it ain't that early.

622
01:04:58,159 --> 01:04:59,867
Must be some kind of holiday.

623
01:05:00,119 --> 01:05:02,361
Sam don't close on holidays.

624
01:05:02,622 --> 01:05:04,947
Maybe he had to go someplace.

625
01:05:08,627 --> 01:05:10,536
Let's go ask Andy.

626
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:27,184
- Somebody will steal the town.
- Where is everybody?

627
01:05:27,394 --> 01:05:31,392
- Asleep. Everybody that's got sense.
- Why'd Sam close the café?

628
01:05:32,024 --> 01:05:34,693
Oh, yeah. Y'all been gone, ain't you?

629
01:05:34,943 --> 01:05:36,603
Gone to Mexico.

630
01:05:37,028 --> 01:05:39,068
- You don't know about it.
- What?

631
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:40,940
Sam died yesterday morning.

632
01:05:42,867 --> 01:05:43,898
Died?

633
01:05:44,118 --> 01:05:45,778
Yep. Quite a blow.

634
01:05:46,037 --> 01:05:49,655
Keeled over one of
the snooker tables, had a stroke.

635
01:05:50,583 --> 01:05:52,409
Sam the Lion?

636
01:05:52,793 --> 01:05:54,750
Yep. Sam's dead.

637
01:05:55,045 --> 01:05:56,788
He was quite a fellow.

638
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:02,007
He had his own way of doing things,
that's for sure.

639
01:06:03,553 --> 01:06:07,004
They found his will.
Craziest thing you ever heard.

640
01:06:07,265 --> 01:06:11,179
He left you the pool hall, Sonny.
What do you think about that?

641
01:06:12,812 --> 01:06:14,970
He left Genevieve the café.

642
01:06:15,189 --> 01:06:18,273
That's the only thing he done
that made any sense.

643
01:06:18,734 --> 01:06:21,403
Left the picture show to old Miss Mosey.

644
01:06:21,653 --> 01:06:25,236
Hell, she's too far gone
to even run a popcorn machine.

645
01:06:25,782 --> 01:06:27,691
And the craziest thing of all...

646
01:06:27,909 --> 01:06:31,907
...he left $1000 to Joe Bob Blanton,
the preacher's boy.

647
01:06:32,455 --> 01:06:34,697
Beats all I ever heard of.

648
01:06:35,082 --> 01:06:37,704
He could just as easily left that to me.

649
01:06:37,918 --> 01:06:41,619
I deserve it at least as much
as that ignorant little bastard.

650
01:06:43,132 --> 01:06:45,171
Anyhow, it's done.

651
01:06:45,425 --> 01:06:47,465
They're burying him tomorrow.

652
01:09:09,226 --> 01:09:10,424
Come in.

653
01:09:25,616 --> 01:09:27,822
- I love you.
- I love you too.

654
01:09:59,147 --> 01:10:00,689
Oh, Duane, hurry.

655
01:10:35,973 --> 01:10:37,302
What's wrong, honey?

656
01:10:39,268 --> 01:10:40,810
I don't know.

657
01:10:42,396 --> 01:10:44,851
That tickles.
I can't stand to be tickled.

658
01:10:54,240 --> 01:10:56,945
What's the matter?
Aren't you gonna do it?

659
01:10:57,285 --> 01:10:58,660
I don't know what's wrong.

660
01:10:58,870 --> 01:11:02,488
How could anything be wrong?
Just go on and do it.

661
01:11:06,335 --> 01:11:08,126
What's the matter with you?

662
01:11:08,879 --> 01:11:10,871
I don't know, something's happened.

663
01:11:11,089 --> 01:11:14,043
Get off a minute!
You might fall and mash me.

664
01:11:14,259 --> 01:11:15,883
I don't know what happened.

665
01:11:16,094 --> 01:11:18,881
It was Mexico.
No telling what you got down there.

666
01:11:19,097 --> 01:11:21,469
I hate you!
I don't know why I dated you.

667
01:11:21,683 --> 01:11:23,640
I don't know what happened.

668
01:11:25,102 --> 01:11:28,970
Put your clothes on.
You think I want to look at you naked?

669
01:11:31,066 --> 01:11:33,853
I knew you couldn't do it.
I'll always be a virgin!

670
01:11:34,069 --> 01:11:36,145
What do we say?
The whole class knows.

671
01:11:36,363 --> 01:11:38,818
I want to cry.
You're the meanest boy ever.

672
01:11:39,032 --> 01:11:41,238
My mother was dead-right about you.

673
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:43,654
I don't know what happened.

674
01:11:43,870 --> 01:11:46,824
Don't go out there!
We haven't had time to do it.

675
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:49,791
I don't want anyone to know.
You better not tell.

676
01:11:51,002 --> 01:11:53,041
You just pretend it was wonderful!

677
01:11:53,254 --> 01:11:55,709
I'm sorry, I don't know what happened.

678
01:11:56,673 --> 01:11:58,749
If you say that again, I'll bite you!

679
01:12:19,111 --> 01:12:21,353
Tell us about it. What was it like?

680
01:12:24,449 --> 01:12:26,857
I just can't describe it.

681
01:12:27,244 --> 01:12:29,817
I just can't describe it in words.

682
01:13:14,746 --> 01:13:17,071
I can do it now. I know I can.

683
01:13:51,656 --> 01:13:54,905
Quit prissing! I don't think
you did it right anyway.

684
01:14:05,377 --> 01:14:06,539
Come on.

685
01:14:16,804 --> 01:14:20,137
It's your graduation present.
Hope you like it.

686
01:14:30,025 --> 01:14:32,183
I never seen one as nice.

687
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:46,872
- Hello?
- Jacy?

688
01:14:47,082 --> 01:14:48,742
What's on your feeble mind?

689
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:50,702
Same as been. I want a date.

690
01:14:51,837 --> 01:14:53,995
Why don't you just go back to Mexico?

691
01:14:54,214 --> 01:14:56,586
I guess girls are easier to please there.

692
01:14:57,008 --> 01:14:58,835
Just go with me one more time.

693
01:14:59,052 --> 01:15:00,546
You can at least see me.

694
01:15:00,762 --> 01:15:03,217
Pester someone else. I got a new boyfriend.

695
01:15:03,431 --> 01:15:05,470
- I can't be talking to you.
- Who?

696
01:15:05,683 --> 01:15:07,260
Bobby Sheen, of course.

697
01:15:09,144 --> 01:15:10,852
- You crazy?
- I certainly am not.

698
01:15:11,063 --> 01:15:14,763
I guess I wanted to go with him
all along and never realized it.

699
01:15:15,067 --> 01:15:17,604
Maybe we'll see you in Wichita sometime.

700
01:15:32,124 --> 01:15:35,041
Goddamn it! Goddamn it to hell!

701
01:15:47,305 --> 01:15:48,680
I hate to see you go.

702
01:15:48,931 --> 01:15:51,173
I don't got a goddamn thing to stay for.

703
01:15:51,392 --> 01:15:54,393
Roughnecks say you can get a job
in Odessa anytime.

704
01:15:55,104 --> 01:15:56,895
Come on back if you don't.

705
01:16:10,201 --> 01:16:12,443
You hear they busted up, let me know.

706
01:16:40,855 --> 01:16:43,393
Why don't we watch the movie?

707
01:16:47,903 --> 01:16:49,646
Hi, I didn't hear you.

708
01:16:50,113 --> 01:16:51,109
Gene home?

709
01:16:51,698 --> 01:16:54,023
No, he and Mama went to the club.

710
01:16:59,205 --> 01:17:01,743
What are you doing home on a Saturday night?

711
01:17:03,334 --> 01:17:05,706
Bobby Sheen ran off and got married.

712
01:17:08,505 --> 01:17:10,048
Annie-Annie Martin.

713
01:17:14,052 --> 01:17:16,009
Want me to turn the TV off?

714
01:17:16,221 --> 01:17:19,969
No, I'm gonna go play pool.
Tell your dad the well came in okay.

715
01:17:21,142 --> 01:17:24,428
I wish I could go to the pool hall.
I've always wanted to.

716
01:17:24,645 --> 01:17:27,599
It's terrible, the things
girls aren't allowed to do.

717
01:17:29,442 --> 01:17:32,526
Well, hell, come on.
I'll show you the pool hall.

718
01:17:32,736 --> 01:17:34,017
Aren't people there?

719
01:17:34,238 --> 01:17:36,942
If there are, they'll be in back asleep now.

720
01:17:37,157 --> 01:17:40,241
Won't bother us. I got my own key.

721
01:17:41,495 --> 01:17:43,368
Okay, I will then.

722
01:17:59,344 --> 01:18:01,918
Goodness, it sure is dark in here.

723
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:06,340
What a night. I never thought
something like this would happen.

724
01:21:08,229 --> 01:21:10,055
How about hopping out?

725
01:21:45,305 --> 01:21:48,009
He's just awful!
Why do you fool with him?

726
01:21:48,224 --> 01:21:51,011
- Daddy's nicer than him, isn't he?
- He sure is.

727
01:21:51,227 --> 01:21:53,184
Your daddy's a very nice man.

728
01:21:53,396 --> 01:21:56,065
I ought to give Abilene hell instead of him.

729
01:21:56,315 --> 01:21:59,600
Bobby was the last one.
I'm just gonna be an old maid.

730
01:21:59,860 --> 01:22:03,644
That's just the way it goes.
You win a few, you lose a few.

731
01:22:03,905 --> 01:22:04,985
What do you do?

732
01:22:05,198 --> 01:22:07,654
Nothing's ever the way it's supposed to be.

733
01:22:07,868 --> 01:22:09,362
You're right. Come on.

734
01:22:13,122 --> 01:22:17,250
I want to tell you something.
What I've done hasn't worked out well.

735
01:22:17,460 --> 01:22:21,327
I think maybe we better think
of something else for you.

736
01:22:23,090 --> 01:22:26,423
I guess Ruth Popper's got
about as good a setup as anyone.

737
01:22:26,635 --> 01:22:30,467
Why, sure. Sonny's reasonably
good-looking and he's young.

738
01:22:30,722 --> 01:22:33,889
Don't you know?
It's been going on about six months.

739
01:22:34,100 --> 01:22:36,935
- I thought you kids knew everything.
- That's silly!

740
01:22:37,145 --> 01:22:38,390
She's 40 years old.

741
01:22:38,604 --> 01:22:41,274
So am I, honey.
It's kind of an itchy age.

742
01:22:41,524 --> 01:22:43,066
Want an orange?

743
01:22:43,317 --> 01:22:45,025
I don't believe it.

744
01:22:45,736 --> 01:22:48,488
Sonny's always wanted to go with me.

745
01:22:53,827 --> 01:22:55,950
Pretty easy shot, sheriff.

746
01:23:04,670 --> 01:23:06,081
Sheriff, we got trouble.

747
01:23:08,090 --> 01:23:11,174
Goddamn you, Monroe!
You made me scratch.

748
01:23:11,385 --> 01:23:15,299
Sorry, sheriff, but Johnny Clarg's
little girl's been kidnapped.

749
01:23:15,681 --> 01:23:18,847
The preacher's boy
put her in his car two hours ago.

750
01:23:19,142 --> 01:23:23,140
What the hell? Maybe Joe Bob
just give her a ride home.

751
01:23:23,354 --> 01:23:25,928
Be doing her a favour in this hot weather.

752
01:23:26,149 --> 01:23:28,818
Who'd want to kidnap Molly Clarg?

753
01:23:29,026 --> 01:23:30,686
I just know she's not home.

754
01:23:30,903 --> 01:23:33,441
They was seen headed toward Olney.

755
01:23:33,656 --> 01:23:36,277
Mrs. Clarg's afraid that Joe Bob might be...

756
01:23:36,533 --> 01:23:39,736
Gonna molest her or something.

757
01:23:39,953 --> 01:23:41,910
You and these boys come with us.

758
01:23:42,622 --> 01:23:45,789
If that's the way it is, no telling what we'll find.

759
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:13,859
Molly!

760
01:24:18,823 --> 01:24:20,899
Get him! Ain't you going to?

761
01:24:21,409 --> 01:24:22,737
Here's my little girl.

762
01:24:22,952 --> 01:24:25,822
He's the one that done it.
Why don't you get him?

763
01:24:26,038 --> 01:24:28,873
If my husband was here, he'd kill him dead.

764
01:24:34,462 --> 01:24:37,582
What'd you do to that child?
We know you done something.

765
01:24:37,882 --> 01:24:39,163
Come on.

766
01:24:42,011 --> 01:24:43,291
Filthy!

767
01:24:43,512 --> 01:24:47,344
Here now, grab her.
None of this goddamn frenzy.

768
01:24:51,645 --> 01:24:53,388
It's the Lord's justice, son.

769
01:24:53,605 --> 01:24:56,226
You'll suffer with the murderer and the thief.

770
01:24:56,441 --> 01:25:00,308
Sonny, drive that Plymouth to town.
We gotta get this man to jail.

771
01:25:10,204 --> 01:25:12,991
- Doctor said he did nothing.
- Never had the guts.

772
01:25:13,207 --> 01:25:16,576
- Preacher's boy.
- Sheriff figured he done something.

773
01:25:23,383 --> 01:25:26,253
Isn't it terrible, Sonny?
Did you see anything?

774
01:25:26,511 --> 01:25:28,669
Nothing to see except Mrs. Clarg.

775
01:25:28,888 --> 01:25:31,426
If she had a gun, she might've killed us all.

776
01:25:31,682 --> 01:25:33,176
Joe Bob didn't do nothing.

777
01:25:33,392 --> 01:25:36,726
He must've done something.
It scares me to death.

778
01:25:36,937 --> 01:25:40,353
You never can tell when something
terrible is gonna happen.

779
01:25:41,608 --> 01:25:43,517
It's okay. They got him now.

780
01:25:43,777 --> 01:25:45,568
I called you before.

781
01:25:46,529 --> 01:25:47,525
You did?

782
01:25:48,490 --> 01:25:52,108
I felt lonesome. Thought you might
want to drive around.

783
01:25:55,538 --> 01:25:57,910
Well, I'm supposed to be someplace.

784
01:25:58,165 --> 01:26:01,997
I'm still a little scared.
Please take me riding.

785
01:26:07,799 --> 01:26:09,128
Where will we drive?

786
01:26:36,201 --> 01:26:37,446
Ever hear from Duane?

787
01:26:37,660 --> 01:26:38,858
Got a postcard.

788
01:26:39,245 --> 01:26:41,783
I really feel sad about that.

789
01:26:42,206 --> 01:26:45,622
He makes 320 a month.
Said he bought a car.

790
01:26:46,627 --> 01:26:51,004
I'll always be a little in love with Duane.
We had too much against us.

791
01:26:51,882 --> 01:26:54,503
It wasn't easy being the one to break up.

792
01:27:24,162 --> 01:27:26,368
- Sonny?
- What?

793
01:28:21,924 --> 01:28:23,715
Not here.

794
01:28:23,926 --> 01:28:26,843
I'm too old for screwing in cars.

795
01:28:30,098 --> 01:28:32,055
I don't like to hurry.

796
01:28:32,851 --> 01:28:36,635
Why don't we go to Wichita
and get a motel room?

797
01:28:36,980 --> 01:28:39,305
I'm afraid to. My folks are watching me.

798
01:28:39,524 --> 01:28:41,931
They know I don't want to go to college.

799
01:28:42,151 --> 01:28:44,856
They might think we'll run off
and get married.

800
01:28:46,697 --> 01:28:48,939
We'll do it when it's safe.

801
01:28:49,742 --> 01:28:52,149
We got all summer.

802
01:29:45,001 --> 01:29:47,124
- Hey, Duane.
- Hey, buddy!

803
01:29:48,672 --> 01:29:49,916
You turned roughneck.

804
01:29:50,131 --> 01:29:52,704
Had to so I could keep the pool hall open.

805
01:29:52,926 --> 01:29:54,752
- When did you get in?
- About 2:00.

806
01:29:54,969 --> 01:29:56,796
I thought I'd surprise you.

807
01:29:58,472 --> 01:29:59,504
Is this yours?

808
01:29:59,723 --> 01:30:03,258
How about that?
38, 000 miles and she runs like new.

809
01:30:03,477 --> 01:30:05,304
- Do you want a beer?
- Not me.

810
01:30:05,896 --> 01:30:08,268
That's all I eat for breakfast anymore.

811
01:30:08,482 --> 01:30:10,474
Hey, sure is a nice car.

812
01:30:10,734 --> 01:30:14,601
I like to drive it so much, I thought
I'd drop home for the weekend.

813
01:30:16,489 --> 01:30:19,573
You can't take too good care
of a car like this.

814
01:30:20,701 --> 01:30:22,493
I wash her every week.

815
01:30:22,703 --> 01:30:24,162
It looks great.

816
01:30:24,997 --> 01:30:26,028
Hear about Joe Bob?

817
01:30:26,290 --> 01:30:28,578
I always knew he was crazy.

818
01:30:28,834 --> 01:30:32,534
He didn't do nothing, except get her
to take her underpants off.

819
01:30:33,171 --> 01:30:34,796
He's out of jail now.

820
01:30:35,882 --> 01:30:37,875
You still screwing that old lady?

821
01:30:39,177 --> 01:30:41,846
No. Yeah.
I've been kind of busy.

822
01:30:42,555 --> 01:30:44,797
I seen old Leroy last week.

823
01:30:45,099 --> 01:30:47,672
He thought you and Jacy been going together.

824
01:30:48,310 --> 01:30:49,686
Yeah, we have, a little.

825
01:30:49,895 --> 01:30:53,346
She's been bored, so sometimes
we go eat Mexican food.

826
01:30:53,649 --> 01:30:55,937
I hear that ain't all you been eating.

827
01:30:57,069 --> 01:31:00,318
Whoever told you that don't know
what he's talking about.

828
01:31:00,530 --> 01:31:02,404
I been going with her. Why not?

829
01:31:02,615 --> 01:31:05,616
I never said I blamed you for it. I don't much.

830
01:31:05,952 --> 01:31:08,703
I never thought you'd do that.
We was friends.

831
01:31:08,913 --> 01:31:12,282
We are. What you so mad for?
I never done nothing to you.

832
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:15,037
- Screwing my girl ain't nothing?
- I ain't.

833
01:31:15,252 --> 01:31:17,743
- Hell, you ain't!
- Well, I ain't.

834
01:31:18,005 --> 01:31:19,665
- She's not your girl.
- She is!

835
01:31:19,881 --> 01:31:22,918
- You don't live here no more.
- That makes no difference!

836
01:31:23,134 --> 01:31:26,420
I'm getting her back.
She'll marry me someday.

837
01:31:26,638 --> 01:31:28,844
- She won't.
- We're meant to get married.

838
01:31:29,057 --> 01:31:30,551
She's off to college soon.

839
01:31:30,767 --> 01:31:34,100
I doubt I'll get to go with her
myself, once she gets off.

840
01:31:34,312 --> 01:31:37,312
I didn't think it could hurt
to go with her this summer.

841
01:31:37,523 --> 01:31:40,061
- She'll never marry you.
- Don't tell me she won't!

842
01:31:40,984 --> 01:31:45,776
She'd never let you screw her.
I was just seeing how honest you was.

843
01:31:46,031 --> 01:31:49,197
Jacy'd never let you.
You ain't that good a cocksman.

844
01:31:49,993 --> 01:31:52,662
You never even screwed Charlene
all that time.

845
01:31:52,871 --> 01:31:55,112
Course I didn't! You know why?

846
01:31:55,331 --> 01:31:58,451
Because you had the pickup
all the time Saturday night.

847
01:31:58,668 --> 01:32:00,375
I didn't have time to screw her.

848
01:32:00,586 --> 01:32:03,456
I could've done it in five minutes
without a pickup.

849
01:32:03,839 --> 01:32:07,006
She only went with you because
you was in the backfield...

850
01:32:07,259 --> 01:32:11,043
- ... and I was in the line.
- What are you saying? We was in love.

851
01:32:11,263 --> 01:32:14,429
You was. She likes me as much
as she ever liked you.

852
01:32:14,724 --> 01:32:17,511
- That's a lie.
- I'll stay with her all night too.

853
01:32:17,727 --> 01:32:19,186
- She promised.
- You won't.

854
01:32:19,395 --> 01:32:20,510
Why shouldn't I?

855
01:32:20,730 --> 01:32:24,264
She told me you couldn't do it
that time in Wichita Falls.

856
01:32:47,254 --> 01:32:48,665
What happened?

857
01:32:53,719 --> 01:32:56,803
This is your Turntable Matinee on KTRN...

858
01:32:57,014 --> 01:33:01,640
...where you can hear Fulton Lewis Jr.
every Monday through Friday, 6:00 p.m.

859
01:33:01,851 --> 01:33:04,058
Now here's Hank Williams.

860
01:33:05,104 --> 01:33:08,224
There's a lady in the waiting room.
She sent you this.

861
01:33:20,994 --> 01:33:22,738
Could you tell her I'm asleep?

862
01:33:23,413 --> 01:33:24,693
Please?

863
01:33:24,956 --> 01:33:26,285
All right.

864
01:33:52,607 --> 01:33:53,805
That too cold?

865
01:33:54,025 --> 01:33:55,567
No, it's great.

866
01:33:57,403 --> 01:34:00,108
Say, I hear Duane joined the Army.

867
01:34:00,364 --> 01:34:02,321
Good place for him too.

868
01:34:02,575 --> 01:34:04,982
He didn't mean to hit me with the bottle.

869
01:34:05,202 --> 01:34:07,954
That boy's always had meanness in him.

870
01:34:08,538 --> 01:34:11,990
Jacy's the kind of girl that
brings out the meanness in a man.

871
01:34:12,209 --> 01:34:14,118
She's just like her grandmother.

872
01:34:16,796 --> 01:34:20,461
I hadn't ought to talk about them.
We was all good friends once.

873
01:34:21,551 --> 01:34:23,839
Dan roughnecked with Gene Farrow.

874
01:34:24,720 --> 01:34:27,472
He and Lois used to live in this one-room place...

875
01:34:27,723 --> 01:34:29,550
...over the newspaper office.

876
01:34:29,975 --> 01:34:33,723
Lois couldn't afford a flour sack, much less a mink.

877
01:34:36,022 --> 01:34:39,023
I've always had a soft spot for her, though.

878
01:34:41,319 --> 01:34:44,189
I wondered a lot of times
what would've happened...

879
01:34:44,447 --> 01:34:47,116
...if my Dan had made
the strikes that Gene made.

880
01:34:47,325 --> 01:34:49,815
They offered that rig to him first.

881
01:34:53,789 --> 01:34:56,825
Dan Morgan never took a chance in his life.

882
01:34:57,793 --> 01:34:59,501
Do you wish y'all had made it?

883
01:35:03,506 --> 01:35:06,080
Sure, I wish we'd made it.

884
01:35:08,469 --> 01:35:11,920
I guess the Army won't take me
now I just got one good eye.

885
01:35:12,139 --> 01:35:14,428
You want to go to Korea and get killed?

886
01:35:14,683 --> 01:35:18,930
You ain't got your senses back yet,
what few you ever had.

887
01:35:20,355 --> 01:35:22,811
The café won't run itself. You rest up now.

888
01:35:23,025 --> 01:35:25,266
Here's for the cheeseburger.

889
01:35:25,527 --> 01:35:28,278
I'll bring your change when I bring your supper.

890
01:35:59,976 --> 01:36:01,434
Come on in.

891
01:36:10,152 --> 01:36:12,228
I was so worried. I had to see you.

892
01:36:12,446 --> 01:36:14,105
I've been missing you.

893
01:36:14,364 --> 01:36:17,400
And I'm a lot better than I was. Here, sit down.

894
01:36:17,909 --> 01:36:21,741
You can't believe how famous we are.
We're all anyone talks about.

895
01:36:21,954 --> 01:36:24,410
- Yeah, I guess so.
- I want us to get married.

896
01:36:25,166 --> 01:36:27,123
- What?
- I really do.

897
01:36:27,376 --> 01:36:29,867
- Get married?
- Just as soon as you want to.

898
01:36:30,087 --> 01:36:32,792
- Don't you want to?
- Oh, yeah.

899
01:36:33,382 --> 01:36:36,750
The town will be knocked for a loop.
They'll never forget it.

900
01:36:36,968 --> 01:36:38,462
Ain't you going to college?

901
01:36:38,678 --> 01:36:42,177
I don't care about that.
I love you. That's more important.

902
01:36:43,182 --> 01:36:47,310
You were so dear to fight for me.
My folks won't like it but we'll run off.

903
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:49,311
- They'll kill us.
- No, they won't.

904
01:36:49,522 --> 01:36:51,431
- They'll kill me.
- They'll get over it.

905
01:36:51,649 --> 01:36:53,475
You work for Daddy now anyway.

906
01:36:53,692 --> 01:36:56,812
Pretty soon, they'll love you
just as much as I do.

907
01:36:59,614 --> 01:37:01,025
Can we?

908
01:37:01,658 --> 01:37:04,742
Sure, I just hope I can see to drive.

909
01:37:05,120 --> 01:37:07,326
Don't you worry. I can drive.

910
01:37:17,590 --> 01:37:19,297
Don't do that, Sonny.

911
01:37:19,716 --> 01:37:21,175
Why not?

912
01:37:21,426 --> 01:37:23,668
We're man and wife. We can do anything.

913
01:37:23,887 --> 01:37:26,592
Not while I'm driving. I might have a wreck.

914
01:37:27,140 --> 01:37:31,303
Wouldn't it be awful if Mama
and Daddy got the police after us?

915
01:37:31,561 --> 01:37:35,689
- They don't even know where we are.
- I had to leave them a note.

916
01:37:35,898 --> 01:37:39,481
- So they wouldn't worry.
- You shouldn't have done that.

917
01:37:39,693 --> 01:37:42,065
I figured they'd have to know sometime.

918
01:37:42,279 --> 01:37:44,485
Well, what could they get us for?

919
01:37:44,698 --> 01:37:47,568
We got a right to get married.
Ain't we?

920
01:37:47,909 --> 01:37:49,653
I guess so.

921
01:37:52,872 --> 01:37:56,739
I wish you didn't have that
stupid eye patch. It's really creepy.

922
01:37:56,959 --> 01:37:59,118
I can take it off pretty soon.

923
01:38:00,046 --> 01:38:04,542
About two hours will be Lake Texoma.
Have a room to ourself.

924
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:08,335
My goodness. You're sitting so close,
I can barely drive.

925
01:38:35,329 --> 01:38:36,609
Oh, goodness.

926
01:39:00,018 --> 01:39:00,884
Howdy.

927
01:39:01,103 --> 01:39:03,428
- What part of Texas y'all from?
- Anarene.

928
01:39:03,647 --> 01:39:05,438
Newlyweds, ain't you?

929
01:39:06,024 --> 01:39:09,439
Y'all better follow me in.
Somebody's looking for you.

930
01:39:09,652 --> 01:39:12,487
We got a right to get married.
How can you arrest us?

931
01:39:12,863 --> 01:39:16,030
I ain't arresting you.
I just want you to come with me.

932
01:39:16,242 --> 01:39:19,907
- I don't know what your rights are.
- I guess we better follow him.

933
01:39:20,120 --> 01:39:23,370
I'll just be heartbroken
if my folks have done this.

934
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:31,164
You think I worked hard
so Jacy'd end up in a pool hall?

935
01:39:31,589 --> 01:39:34,080
- We was gonna get an apartment.
- I'll bet!

936
01:39:34,300 --> 01:39:37,883
Where are your car keys, hon?
It's a hell of a note!

937
01:39:38,095 --> 01:39:40,764
- Shut up and take her home.
- You bet I will!

938
01:39:40,973 --> 01:39:44,555
You take her car.
As far as I'm concerned, he can walk!

939
01:40:13,128 --> 01:40:16,082
Not much of a wedding night, huh?

940
01:40:16,339 --> 01:40:17,370
Not much of one.

941
01:40:17,590 --> 01:40:21,042
Here. Have a little drink of bourbon.
It'll pick you up.

942
01:40:21,261 --> 01:40:23,300
Take all of it. I'm gonna drive.

943
01:40:25,765 --> 01:40:27,140
You won't believe this...

944
01:40:27,391 --> 01:40:30,641
...but you're lucky we got you
clear of her quick as we did.

945
01:40:31,020 --> 01:40:34,104
You'd have been better off
staying with Ruth Popper.

946
01:40:34,314 --> 01:40:36,473
Does everybody know about that?

947
01:40:36,733 --> 01:40:37,931
Of course.

948
01:40:38,443 --> 01:40:42,772
Sounded like a good deal to me, kiddo.
Shouldn't let Jacy turn your head.

949
01:40:43,031 --> 01:40:45,023
Well, she's prettier.

950
01:40:45,950 --> 01:40:50,161
I guess I shouldn't have, though.
I guess I treated her terrible.

951
01:40:50,413 --> 01:40:51,823
Guess you did.

952
01:41:11,849 --> 01:41:13,972
Sure weren't out of Texas very long.

953
01:41:14,185 --> 01:41:17,139
Oklahoma's not much of an improvement.

954
01:41:22,568 --> 01:41:24,441
It's not the same now.

955
01:41:26,196 --> 01:41:29,280
Nothing's really been right since Sam the Lion died.

956
01:41:34,912 --> 01:41:36,786
No, it hasn't.

957
01:41:40,459 --> 01:41:42,037
Oh, God.

958
01:41:44,963 --> 01:41:47,668
I get sad if I think of Sam for long.

959
01:41:51,595 --> 01:41:53,671
Did you know he had beautiful hands?

960
01:41:55,473 --> 01:41:57,762
I guess you liked him, didn't you?

961
01:41:58,935 --> 01:42:01,011
I guess everybody did.

962
01:42:03,105 --> 01:42:06,391
Well, I'll tell you, it was different with me.

963
01:42:06,734 --> 01:42:08,144
I loved him.

964
01:42:09,778 --> 01:42:11,735
He loved me too.

965
01:42:17,369 --> 01:42:21,117
Are you the one he used to take
swimming out at the tank?

966
01:42:21,331 --> 01:42:23,537
He told you about that, huh?

967
01:42:24,750 --> 01:42:26,293
Yeah, I was the one.

968
01:42:29,880 --> 01:42:32,751
I guess if it wasn't for Sam...

969
01:42:32,966 --> 01:42:36,501
...I'd just about have missed it. Whatever it is.

970
01:42:38,138 --> 01:42:41,423
I'd have been one of them amity types that thinks...

971
01:42:41,683 --> 01:42:45,348
...that playing bridge is
the best thing that life has to offer.

972
01:42:53,110 --> 01:42:55,186
Old Sam the Lion.

973
01:42:58,157 --> 01:43:02,284
Nobody knows where he got that name.
I gave it to him.

974
01:43:02,953 --> 01:43:04,281
One night...

975
01:43:04,746 --> 01:43:07,035
...it just came to me.

976
01:43:11,252 --> 01:43:13,292
He was so pleased.

977
01:43:16,799 --> 01:43:19,254
I was 22 years old then.

978
01:43:20,636 --> 01:43:22,178
Can you imagine?

979
01:43:26,391 --> 01:43:27,554
It's terrible...

980
01:43:27,767 --> 01:43:31,682
...to only meet one man in life
who knows what you're worth.

981
01:43:33,398 --> 01:43:34,477
Just terrible.

982
01:43:37,693 --> 01:43:39,187
I've looked too.

983
01:43:40,946 --> 01:43:43,354
You wouldn't believe how I've looked.

984
01:43:48,120 --> 01:43:51,286
Well, now I know. That's why Sam liked you.

985
01:43:51,498 --> 01:43:52,529
Loved me.

986
01:43:52,749 --> 01:43:54,243
Loved you, I mean.

987
01:43:55,293 --> 01:43:56,668
Do you?

988
01:43:58,129 --> 01:44:00,916
I can kind of see what he saw in you too.

989
01:44:10,349 --> 01:44:12,555
Nope. I'll just go on home.

990
01:44:12,893 --> 01:44:14,221
Go on. Get out.

991
01:44:18,690 --> 01:44:21,940
Think I could learn to drink?

992
01:44:28,491 --> 01:44:31,160
You might. Better keep on practising.

993
01:45:01,480 --> 01:45:03,805
That Logan boy's a quarterback, ain't he?

994
01:45:04,024 --> 01:45:06,479
Boy, we've finally got us a team!

995
01:45:06,818 --> 01:45:08,894
Didn't back in your day, did they?

996
01:45:09,237 --> 01:45:10,731
No, we wasn't much good.

997
01:45:11,072 --> 01:45:13,361
You just never learned the fundamentals.

998
01:45:13,574 --> 01:45:16,030
You know, blocking and tackling.

999
01:45:16,327 --> 01:45:17,869
Not like this team.

1000
01:45:18,120 --> 01:45:20,409
- When was it you graduated?
- Last year.

1001
01:45:20,664 --> 01:45:21,743
You don't mean it.

1002
01:45:21,999 --> 01:45:25,202
Seems longer than that
since you and Duane played ball.

1003
01:45:25,460 --> 01:45:27,002
I seen Duane a while ago.

1004
01:45:27,212 --> 01:45:29,584
He's home on leave, wearing his uniform.

1005
01:45:29,839 --> 01:45:31,796
I ain't seen him yet.

1006
01:45:37,221 --> 01:45:39,130
- How are you, Chester?
- Fine, coach.

1007
01:45:39,348 --> 01:45:42,515
See if we can't stretch
that goddamn thing a little.

1008
01:45:42,726 --> 01:45:47,055
You know a man never ought to cheat,
unless it's for a good cause.

1009
01:45:48,190 --> 01:45:50,099
He's a good old boy, ain't he?

1010
01:46:42,782 --> 01:46:44,276
Hi, Mrs. Jackson.

1011
01:46:44,576 --> 01:46:45,607
Duane here?

1012
01:46:45,952 --> 01:46:50,032
That's his car out there, ain't it?
He's here if he ain't walked off.

1013
01:46:58,047 --> 01:46:59,541
Hi, how you been?

1014
01:47:00,090 --> 01:47:01,632
Pretty good.

1015
01:47:04,219 --> 01:47:06,971
I been thinking all week that I'd run into you.

1016
01:47:09,682 --> 01:47:11,509
I heard you was going to Korea.

1017
01:47:11,726 --> 01:47:14,643
Thought I'd get over
and see you before you got off.

1018
01:47:15,646 --> 01:47:18,766
Glad you did.
I'm taking the bus in the morning.

1019
01:47:26,448 --> 01:47:29,947
Want to go to the picture show?
Miss Mosey has to close it.

1020
01:47:30,160 --> 01:47:33,576
- Tonight's the last night.
- Yeah, might as well go.

1021
01:47:33,830 --> 01:47:36,784
Hate to miss the last night. Take the Mercury.

1022
01:47:37,166 --> 01:47:39,622
Be my last chance to drive it for a while.

1023
01:47:46,008 --> 01:47:48,463
- Ready, Matthew?
- All ready.

1024
01:48:14,451 --> 01:48:16,360
Take them to Missouri, Matt.

1025
01:49:15,883 --> 01:49:17,377
That was a good movie.

1026
01:49:17,593 --> 01:49:19,550
Seen it here before once.

1027
01:49:20,721 --> 01:49:23,342
Let's run over to Wichita and drink some beer.

1028
01:49:23,557 --> 01:49:25,965
Okay. I got lots of time till morning.

1029
01:49:26,226 --> 01:49:27,471
Sure.

1030
01:49:29,312 --> 01:49:31,982
- So long.
- Sorry you're closing the show.

1031
01:49:32,190 --> 01:49:34,728
Nobody wants to come to shows no more.

1032
01:49:35,193 --> 01:49:38,858
Kid baseball in the summer, television all the time.

1033
01:49:40,448 --> 01:49:43,863
Sam had lived, I believe we could've kept it going.

1034
01:49:44,368 --> 01:49:46,906
But I just didn't have the know-how.

1035
01:49:48,038 --> 01:49:51,288
Won't be much to do in town
with the picture show closed.

1036
01:49:53,835 --> 01:49:55,413
Well, so long.

1037
01:49:56,171 --> 01:49:57,202
Duane.

1038
01:49:58,465 --> 01:50:00,504
You watch out now, overseas.

1039
01:50:23,655 --> 01:50:25,694
Sure weren't no women around.

1040
01:50:28,618 --> 01:50:31,535
I guess the next piece of ass I get will be yellow.

1041
01:50:32,288 --> 01:50:34,079
I wish I was going with you.

1042
01:50:36,583 --> 01:50:38,410
Take care of the car for me.

1043
01:50:38,961 --> 01:50:40,419
Your ma don't need it?

1044
01:50:40,629 --> 01:50:43,748
I wouldn't want her driving it, the way she drives.

1045
01:50:43,965 --> 01:50:46,919
You might help her take
the groceries home sometimes.

1046
01:51:00,147 --> 01:51:01,475
You ever...

1047
01:51:01,732 --> 01:51:03,142
You ever hear from Jacy?

1048
01:51:04,026 --> 01:51:05,852
No, not a thing.

1049
01:51:06,111 --> 01:51:10,155
She don't get home much.
Ain't been back to town since August.

1050
01:51:10,365 --> 01:51:12,357
I guess she always stays in Dallas.

1051
01:51:13,076 --> 01:51:14,867
Yeah, probably does.

1052
01:51:16,370 --> 01:51:18,363
I guess there's lots to do there.

1053
01:51:24,128 --> 01:51:26,334
I ain't over her yet, you know.

1054
01:51:28,507 --> 01:51:30,416
No, I ain't over her yet.

1055
01:51:31,760 --> 01:51:33,503
It's the damnedest thing.

1056
01:51:36,681 --> 01:51:41,224
That's the only reason you and I
got into it that time, you know.

1057
01:51:43,938 --> 01:51:45,396
Reckon she likes Dallas?

1058
01:51:46,357 --> 01:51:48,017
Hard to say. Maybe she does.

1059
01:51:51,528 --> 01:51:55,739
Reckon you and her would've got it
straighted out if I hadn't butted in?

1060
01:51:58,952 --> 01:52:01,787
No, they'd have annulled me too,
even if we had.

1061
01:52:07,168 --> 01:52:09,659
Y'all never even got into the motel?

1062
01:52:17,636 --> 01:52:20,174
Better get on before we both freeze.

1063
01:52:30,147 --> 01:52:31,891
Here are the keys.

1064
01:52:33,651 --> 01:52:35,976
- So long, buddy.
- So long, Duane.

1065
01:52:37,029 --> 01:52:38,191
Be careful.

1066
01:52:38,947 --> 01:52:40,525
I'll take care of your car.

1067
01:52:40,741 --> 01:52:43,278
See you in a year or two if I don't get shot.

1068
01:54:19,207 --> 01:54:21,496
The trucker didn't have a chance.

1069
01:54:24,421 --> 01:54:26,413
I could see it wasn't his fault.

1070
01:54:30,092 --> 01:54:31,373
The sand was blowing.

1071
01:54:31,594 --> 01:54:34,797
I never noticed him.
Figured nobody'd be in the street.

1072
01:54:35,014 --> 01:54:37,505
What was he doing out there anyway?

1073
01:54:37,725 --> 01:54:40,595
He weren't doing nothing.
He's just simple-minded.

1074
01:54:40,811 --> 01:54:42,720
- Never had sense.
- Wasn't your fault.

1075
01:54:42,938 --> 01:54:44,480
Hell, no. I can see that.

1076
01:54:44,731 --> 01:54:46,356
He was just a dumb old kid.

1077
01:54:46,608 --> 01:54:49,609
Didn't know enough to keep his ass
out of the cold.

1078
01:54:49,819 --> 01:54:51,776
Let's eat. Ain't had breakfast.

1079
01:54:51,988 --> 01:54:54,905
I'd like to know what
he was doing with that broom.

1080
01:54:55,116 --> 01:54:57,903
He was sweeping, you sons of bitches!

1081
01:54:58,160 --> 01:54:59,868
He was sweeping!

1082
01:56:03,763 --> 01:56:06,301
Y'all got some crazy kids in this town.

1083
01:58:39,783 --> 01:58:42,321
Could I have a cup of coffee with you?

1084
01:58:45,205 --> 01:58:46,580
I guess.

1085
01:58:55,465 --> 01:58:58,002
I'm sorry. I'm still in my bathrobe.

1086
01:59:20,321 --> 01:59:22,693
What am I doing apologising to you?

1087
01:59:22,907 --> 01:59:26,738
Why am I always apologising to you,
you little bastard?!

1088
01:59:26,952 --> 01:59:30,072
Three months I've apologised to you
without you even here!

1089
01:59:30,289 --> 01:59:33,823
I haven't done anything wrong.
Why can't I quit apologising?

1090
01:59:34,042 --> 01:59:35,536
You ought to be sorry!

1091
01:59:36,044 --> 01:59:40,124
I wouldn't be in my bathrobe if not
for you. I'd have my clothes on.

1092
01:59:40,381 --> 01:59:43,880
You're the one made me quit caring
if I got dressed or not!

1093
01:59:45,344 --> 01:59:47,384
Just because your friend got killed...

1094
01:59:47,596 --> 01:59:51,131
...you want me to forget what you did
and make it all right?

1095
01:59:51,350 --> 01:59:53,342
I'm not sorry for you.

1096
01:59:53,602 --> 01:59:56,093
You'd have left Billy, just like you left me.

1097
01:59:56,313 --> 01:59:58,305
I bet you left him plenty of nights...

1098
01:59:58,523 --> 02:00:00,267
...whenever Jacy whistled.

1099
02:00:00,483 --> 02:00:02,476
I wouldn't treat a dog that way.

1100
02:00:03,027 --> 02:00:07,239
You thought I was so old and ugly
you didn't owe me any explanation.

1101
02:00:07,448 --> 02:00:09,275
You didn't need to be careful.

1102
02:00:09,492 --> 02:00:12,777
There was nothing I could do, so why be careful?

1103
02:00:12,995 --> 02:00:14,026
You didn't love me.

1104
02:00:14,872 --> 02:00:15,986
Look at me.

1105
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:19,791
Can't you even look at me?

1106
02:00:32,763 --> 02:00:33,926
See?

1107
02:00:35,349 --> 02:00:37,140
Shouldn't have come here.

1108
02:00:37,768 --> 02:00:39,761
I'm around that corner now.

1109
02:00:40,979 --> 02:00:42,390
You've ruined it.

1110
02:00:42,773 --> 02:00:44,931
It's lost completely.

1111
02:00:47,485 --> 02:00:50,522
Just your needing me won't make it come back.

1112
02:02:35,252 --> 02:02:37,459
Never you mind, honey.

1113
02:02:38,297 --> 02:02:40,088
Never you mind.

1114
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:44,107
