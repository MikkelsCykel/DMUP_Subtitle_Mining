00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:39,100
Let's find him.
I know he's here somewhere.

2
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,800
Come on, look for it.
I know it's here.

3
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,100
- There!
- Over to the right.

4
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,000
That's it. There it is!

5
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,500
That's it. All right!

6
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,800
- This is it, all right.
- Let's rip this sucker open!

7
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,900
Get a look at the main man!

8
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,800
Come on, dig! Deeper!

9
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:23,400
Come on, dig. Come on, let's dig!
Come on, faster! Dig!

10
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:33,100
Get the dirt off and we'll open it.
This is it.

11
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,500
Come on!

12
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,800
Come on.

13
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,500
- Pry.
- Move it over here.

14
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,200
Harder. Come on.

15
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:59,900
- Come on, Neil!
- OK, here it comes.

16
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,900
No... please, no!

UNGER INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH.

18
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:51,100
PINEHURST YOUTH DEVELOPMENT CENTER.

19
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,900
That must be the new kid.

20
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,300
Last stop. Everybody out.

21
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:01,700
No? Beautiful. Sit there.
I don't give a shit.

22
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,600
How you doing?

23
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,400
Tommy Jarvis?
Hi, my name is Pam Roberts.

24
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,400
I'm the assistant director.
I'm glad you're here.

25
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:20,900
If you'd like to grab your things,
I'll take you in to meet the doctor.

26
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,900
Great.

27
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,100
Thank you.

28
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,000
Anytime, doll.

29
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,300
How was the ride?

30
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,900
Come on, Tommy.

31
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,700
You OK?

32
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,600
- Come in.
- Hi.

33
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:10,900
Hi, Tommy. I'm Matthew Letter.
Welcome to Pinehurst. Have a seat.

34
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,100
Sit down, son.

35
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,900
I'll tell you
a little about Pinehurst,

36
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,100
then we'll let you get settled.
How's that sound?

37
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,800
How does that sound?

38
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,500
Sure.

39
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,900
All right. About Pinehurst,

40
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,400
you'll find we're very different
from the state institution.

41
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:53,200
We don't have any guards here.
Nobody tells you what to do.

42
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:58,100
- Basically, you're your own boss.
- It's an honor system.

43
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,900
What you're really doing here, Tommy,

44
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:06,700
is preparing yourself to re-enter
society and start a new life.

45
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:13,000
Pam, wanna point Tommy toward
his room and get him started?

46
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,600
Sure. OK? Go through the kitchen,
up the stairs,

47
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:22,000
and it's the first door
on your left, OK? See you in a bit.

48
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
- What do you think?
- The kid's a real talker.

49
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,500
I noticed.
How'd they diagnose him?

50
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,800
Severe trauma at age 12.

51
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:41,800
Brutal self-defense murder
of a psychopathic killer.

52
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:46,300
They've given him every therapy
and treatment they can think of.

53
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,800
It's a wonder his mind
isn't fried from all the drugs.

54
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:02,300
You scared of spiders?
You scared of rubber spiders?

55
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:10,100
Scared of rubber spiders on strings?
Man, you are one scared cat.

56
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,700
Where I come from,
you learn to be scared of nothing.

57
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,900
They call me Reggie the Reckless.
No spider scares me.

58
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,600
Joke, man!

59
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,600
- Don't.
- Don't get all twisted out of shape.

60
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:11,100
- You act like you made these things.
- I did.

61
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,300
Solid.

62
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,400
So you're the new nut?

63
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,200
"- Is that what they call us?
- ""Us""? I ain't one of you."

64
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,500
I'm just visiting.
My granddaddy works here.

65
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,200
Gotta split.
Catch you later. There's action.

66
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,600
Joey, come on. Hurry up.
Oh, my God!

67
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:45,400
Hey, you guys! Joey, come on.

68
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,400
Stop, Grandpa! Don't!

69
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,600
- Hey, Matt. How's it going?
- All right. What's up?

70
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,700
It's like we talked about.

71
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:11,400
You got some neighbors who
aren't happy about your place.

72
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:15,000
I respect
what you're trying to do, Matt, I do.

73
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:20,200
But we found a couple of your kids
on the Hubbard place again.

74
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,200
- Deputy! Bring 'em out.
- Yes, sir.

75
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:30,100
Everybody out.
Stop fooling around. Fall in.

76
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,000
- Yes, sir.
- Move, wise guy.

77
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,700
We found them in Hubbard's woods
screwing their heads off, Matt.

78
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,700
We're lucky this time,
because Ethel didn't see them.

79
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,900
I'll take care of it, Sheriff.

80
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,300
- I'll do the talking. Keep quiet.
- Morning, Ethel.

81
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,700
- Don't you look lovely?
- Horseshit!

82
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:10,500
Sheriff, you better hear me good.
I want this loony bin closed down.

83
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,200
You hear? These kids
ain't nothing but trouble!

84
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,900
They disrespect property,
and they're all crazy!

85
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:21,800
- You tell 'em, Ma!
- These kids weren't doing...

86
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,400
Doing? Doing?!

87
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,400
You think I don't know what those
two perverts were doing in my yard!

88
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,500
- Say it like you mean it, Ma!
- Would you shut the fuck up?

89
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,900
I'll tell all of you.

90
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,200
You mark my words,
the next bastard comes near my farm,

91
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,500
I'll blow your fucking brains out.
You hear?

92
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:51,000
Don't you come near me, Sheriff,
I've warned you.

93
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,600
I've got a bomb on me.
I swear to you!

94
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,000
Make one move toward me,
I'm gonna blow us all up.

95
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:02,000
Start the engines, Junior.
That's it. My final words.

96
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,200
OK, people, let's go. Party's over.

97
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,300
She's really something, ain't she?

98
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,800
Seriously, try to keep
your kids off her property.

99
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,200
I will.

100
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,400
I understand
you got the Jarvis kid today.

101
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,200
- He arrived earlier.
- And?

102
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,600
- And what?
- What's he like?

103
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:38,000
He's like any other kid.
He's been through a lot.

104
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:43,300
- Yeah. Good luck with him, pal.
- Thanks a lot, Sheriff.

105
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,600
- Hi, girls.
- Hi, Joey.

106
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,000
Hi, Violet.

107
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:46,000
- What are you doing?
- Laundry, Joey.

108
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:51,600
Can I help? I'm very good at laundry.
Matt never assigns it to me.

109
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,600
- Look, we have to get this finished.
- So I'm here to help you.

110
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,300
You can count on me, Rob.
You too, Vi.

111
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,100
Want a chocolate bar?
Here, you want it?

112
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,100
- I'll give you half.
- Piss off!

113
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:11,200
Please let me help you.
It's no problem...

114
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,100
- Get out of here!
- Fuck!

115
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,100
I'm sorry.
I can do laundry great.

116
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:22,600
But if that's how you feel,
forget it.

117
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:27,300
I'll just go help somebody else
instead. I'll see you later.

118
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,600
If you change your mind,
I'll be right around...

119
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,100
Jesus, what a loser.

120
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:43,500
Look at this sheet.
I'm not gonna wash it, you wash it.

121
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,100
- Hi, Vic!
- Get lost.

122
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,100
Don't be like that.
Let me help you with the wood.

123
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:57,500
And anyway,
I got two chocolate bars, see?

124
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:02,300
- Don't tell the girls.
- What an asshole.

125
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,600
You know, Vic, before I came here,
I never had anything to do,

126
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,900
me being an orphan and all.

127
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,900
People always teased me about
sitting round like some kind of pig.

128
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:23,400
But here, it's different. I can
help others and do a lot of things.

129
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,000
You know something?
I really love it here.

130
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,500
I hate it!

131
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:34,900
You know, to be honest with you,
I never chopped wood before,

132
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,400
but it certainly looks like fun.

133
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,800
Leave me alone!

134
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,000
Here, Vic. Want a bite?

135
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:52,700
I'll just put it over here
and you can have it later.

136
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:00,300
Well, if that's the way you feel,
forget it, Vic! Just forget it!

137
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,700
But I think
you're really out of line.

138
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,900
We got a homicide on our hands.
See what you've got on a Faden.

139
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,700
Victor J. Faden.
F-A-D-E-N. Thanks.

140
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,400
Is there someone we should notify?

141
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,400
As far as I know,
there's no immediate family.

142
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,000
His mother died while giving birth.

143
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:01,700
I don't know about the father,
took off somewhere, I guess.

144
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,500
The kid got shuffled from home
to home until he came here.

145
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,400
- He was a good kid.
- I know, Matt.

146
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,900
So, what have we got here?

147
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,700
Bunch of pussies.

148
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:44,100
Come on, Roy.
Get your hands dirty.

149
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:15,100
Pete, this is bullshit!
This really sucks!

150
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:18,000
Fix it!
Those cunts aren't gonna wait.

151
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,800
Oh, fuck! This is a mess.

152
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,200
No way, I refuse to do this.

153
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:35,700
You're always fucking around
with this, so get up and fix it!

154
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,700
You understand?

155
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:49,700
- You are an asshole!
- What's the matter, Vinny?

156
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:53,500
You all creeped-out
by that murder at the nuthouse?

157
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:57,500
As far as I'm concerned,
all those loonies should be

158
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,300
killed off one by one.
Can you try it now?

159
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:07,100
Jesus! Can't you do anything?
Stop screwing around!

160
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:11,700
Get this done by the time I get back.
I gotta take a crap.

161
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,900
- Crap, my ass!
- Just do it, man! I mean it.

162
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,700
Fucking asshole!

163
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,500
You little fuck.

164
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,800
What are you doing, douchebag?

165
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,200
Enough, already. You can stop.

166
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,900
Would you cut it out?

167
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:51,500
All right, either you got the car
started or you're a dead man.

168
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,900
This ain't starting, man.
You fucked up again.

169
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:07,200
I'm gonna kick your ass,
kick your ass!

170
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,400
Come on everybody,
this ain't startin'!

171
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,600
Come on, motherfucker,
fix the fucking car!

172
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:17,500
Come on.
You fucked up again, you asshole!

173
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:21,800
What you doing up there, Vinny?
You're a dirty...

174
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:28,500
All right. And we're off. Let's go!

175
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,800
Die!

176
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,800
- Die!
- Tommy!

177
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,700
There you go.

178
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,600
- Gramps.
- What is it, son?

179
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,200
Can I go see my brother tomorrow?

180
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,800
We'll see.
You know how I feel about that.

181
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,100
- But Gramps...
- I said we'll see, Reggie.

182
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,500
Come here, Reggie the Reckless.

183
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:30,800
Do me a favor, don't kiss me
when there's people around.

184
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:35,700
OK, it's cool. Go and let
everyone know breakfast is ready.

185
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:42,100
Breakfast! Come and get it!

186
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,400
I could've done that.

187
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:52,400
- I-I m-miss Joey already.
- So do I.

188
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:56,600
I-I hope Victor
gets what's coming to him.

189
00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:00,500
- Morning, everybody.
- Morning.

190
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:05,200
Violet, you set too many places.

191
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,500
I said, you set too many places.

192
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:12,400
- No, I didn't!
- Yes, you did!

193
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:16,100
Victor and Joey won't be here
this morning, Violet.

194
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,600
Or any other morning.

195
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:22,600
- Reggie!
- Oh, God. I'm sorry.

196
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,500
Y-you don't s-set a place
for a dead person.

197
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:32,700
- I said I was sorry!
- What's going on here?

198
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:52,000
Look, I know how you all feel.

199
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:55,500
This thing is not easy...
for any of us.

200
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,400
So let's just have breakfast.

201
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,000
I'm sorry, Violet.

202
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:16,300
- Where's Eddie?
- He's upstairs.

203
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,300
Would you mind telling Eddie
to come downstairs?

204
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,200
Tommy? Would you mind?

205
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,400
Yeah, all right.

206
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,300
Relax, Chief. What's wrong,
no sense of humor?

207
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,300
Can't you take a joke?

208
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:10,600
It's all right, Tommy!
It's gonna be all right.

209
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:14,300
Just relax.
You're gonna be just fine.

210
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:27,500
I'm gonna chop you into
itty-bitty little pieces, my friend.

211
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:32,100
Just like they done to that piggo
over at that fucking crazy farm.

212
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:43,200
You big dildo. Eat your fucking slop.

213
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:48,100
Ain't I make the best
God damn stew in the world?

214
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,500
Best God damn stew in the world!

215
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:56,600
It's that God damn coyote,
trying to kill my lot again.

216
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:00,300
I'll show that bastard
once and for all, Junior.

217
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:10,300
Holy shit! Who the fuck are you
and what the fuck do you want?

218
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,600
I'd like to earn a meal.

219
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:19,100
- Yeah? What do you do?
- Whatever you need done.

220
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:23,900
OK. Clean all the shit
out of the chicken coop

221
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,100
and dump it behind the shed.

222
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:30,200
You come back here after that
and I'll fill your stomach.

223
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,500
Yes, ma'am.

224
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,800
That is one fucking ugly man
that goes there.

225
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:49,800
- One fucking ugly man, Mama.
- Would you shut your trap?!

226
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,700
You ain't so pretty yourself,
you know.

227
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,000
I ain't so pretty myself, I know.

228
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,800
I want every inch of this area
combed thoroughly.

229
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:10,300
- Bring back anything you find.
- Yes, sir.

230
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,800
- What the hell's going on here?
- You talking to me, Sheriff?

231
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,900
I thought you was talking to me.

232
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:28,800
No, Roy. It's OK.
Go ahead. Get them out of here.

233
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,200
Looks like we got us a maniac
on the loose, huh, Sheriff?

234
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,600
Lana! Hey, Lana!

235
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,900
Sorry, buster. We're closed.

236
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,500
It's OK,
I just want a take-out order.

237
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:16,000
You do? What would you like?

238
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:18,400
I'd like Lana to go with nothing on.

239
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,200
And who wants her?

240
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:25,500
The pride of the Unger
Institute of Mental Health,

241
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:30,300
who's dumped his last bedpan
and would like very much to party.

242
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:34,900
Lana...
I don't know, I'll have to ask her.

243
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:39,300
Hey, Lana. You want Billy?
You sure?

244
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:44,700
She wants you, too. But you'll
have to wait till she's done.

245
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:53,700
There. I'm going to party.

246
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:07,500
It's show time!

247
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,000
That's it.

248
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:23,900
That's it. That's the whole
fucking thing right there.

249
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,900
There it is.
You just stay right there, doll.

250
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:34,400
That's just what the doctor ordered.
A little preventive medicine.

251
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,900
And the forecast is...
cloudy in the mountains,

252
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,500
sunny in the valleys,
and snow flurries up your nose.

253
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:37,900
Girl, you are so hot.

254
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,200
What the fuck is she doing?

255
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,000
Jesus Christ! Come on, will you?

256
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,300
You bad kitty.
I don't like you any more.

257
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,600
I feed you,
and you scare me like that.

258
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,700
Go on, kitty.

259
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,900
Sorry.

260
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,900
Billy, what are you doing?
It's cold.

261
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:11,100
This is cute.
I like this. A whole lot.

262
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,200
You'll waste a lot of money
this way, smartie.

263
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,400
Oh, well,
that just means more for me.

264
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,300
Yummy.

265
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,600
Oh, my God. Billy!

266
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:57,400
I don't care if you have to put
your fucking mother behind bars!

267
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:01,700
Get me the God damn psycho
who's responsible for this mess.

268
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,200
I mean, shit, Tucker,
what the hell's going on here?

269
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,300
I mean, this is a small town, man.

270
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:13,900
And small towns
are supposed to be safe.

271
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,700
I know who it is.

272
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:30,800
- What?
- I said, I know who it is.

273
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:36,100
- Who?
- It's Jason Voorhees.

274
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,300
Jason Voorhees?

275
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,900
You're out of your mind!
You've been in the sun too long.

276
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:50,700
Jason is dead! His body was cremated.
He's nothing but a handful of ash.

277
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:55,900
You know that for sure, Mayor?
Did you see him cremated?

278
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:59,100
Jason Voorhees.
I can't believe this!

279
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:05,600
Here, this is your
Jason Voorhees, here. This.

280
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,900
Your ass is on the line here,
Tucker. Are you getting that?

281
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:19,500
You get me a God damn live suspect!

282
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:43,700
- You fuck! You really scared me.
- You loved it.

283
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:49,900
- You want more?
- Eddie, we can't.

284
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:53,200
- Matt will kill us.
- Fuck him.

285
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:59,000
- Fuck you.
- Exactly. Fuck me.

286
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:03,300
Come on. Come on.

287
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,200
Come on.

288
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:25,000
Watch the dirt. Watch the dirt.

289
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:51,200
- What?
- Wait a minute.

290
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:53,300
Especially for the occasion.

291
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,700
- I'll go wash up.
- OK, sugar.

292
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:13,200
- Hurry back.
- I'm hurrying.

293
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:45,300
I'm back.

294
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:49,700
What is this? Sleeping?

295
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:30,600
- Let's get this show on the road!
- Wait a minute, I'm coming.

296
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,600
I just don't understand it.

297
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:37,300
Reggie, I want you to be
a good kid with Pam.

298
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:41,500
- She's doing us both a great favor.
- If she ever gets here.

299
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:44,500
Don't go getting
into trouble with Demon.

300
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:48,200
All right! Pam! Come on!

301
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:53,800
Tina and Eddie will show up when
they get hungry, so stop worrying.

302
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,900
I'm not worried any more.
I'm just pissed.

303
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,200
Stop it.

304
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:09,800
Take Tommy with you. It'll probably
do him good to get away.

305
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:12,800
Yeah, that's a good idea.

306
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:17,300
Tommy! Pam's taking Reggie
to see his brother tonight.

307
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:21,300
- Why don't you go too?
- Great idea. Let's go.

308
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,100
Go see what you can do.

309
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,100
Come on. It'll be fun.

310
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:50,000
Good.

311
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:36,900
TRAILER PARK.

312
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,500
- Come on.
- No. I'll wait here.

313
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:59,800
- Come on.
- I'm OK.

314
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:05,700
Yo, Demon!

315
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:09,200
- Is that the big bad wolf?
- Yeah. Open up!

316
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:12,300
- That you, Reckless?
- Open up!

317
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:16,800
Oh, my God!
Get your ass in here, boy!

318
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:21,600
God, it's to good see you!
Damn, you look good!

319
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:23,500
I know, I know.

320
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:27,000
Oh, God. Look at this.
You had any dinner?

321
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:34,100
- Here. Have an enchilada. Man...
- Where'd you get those bad rings?

322
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:38,100
If you'd lived as long as
your big brother, you'd get things.

323
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:43,300
"Freaking ""A""! Where'd you get that?"

324
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:48,800
Calm down, dude. Say hello
to Anita. She's my girlfriend.

325
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:52,700
- Hello, beautiful.
- Hey, little brother.

326
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,600
I want you to meet somebody.

327
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:58,700
Hey, Pam!
Come here, baby, come here.

328
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:02,600
This is my friend Pam.
She's my girlfriend.

329
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,200
What's up, Pam?

330
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:23,400
Pam, you hungry? Want a taco?
What about a slice of pizza?

331
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,500
- No.
- Cheese and sausage.

332
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:30,100
What about you, brother?
You want a beer? Get out of here.

333
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:34,000
I'll tell you what.
Why don't you take this?

334
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:40,400
- Man, this is bad!
- Nothing's too good for my brother.

335
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:42,600
Gonna give me this, too?

336
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:27,700
I got you, didn't I?
Really scared you, didn't I?

337
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:31,100
Are you dumb or something?

338
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,700
You're a crazy from the loony bin!

339
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:47,200
My mama's going to chop you up
into itty-bitty pieces, my friend!

340
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:53,000
You hear me?
I said, are you hearing me?

341
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:56,400
I said, are you hearing me?!

342
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:01,100
Fuck you, lunatic!

343
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,100
Reggie, we've got to go now.

344
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:46,500
- OK, bro. Take care.
- Thanks for the dinner.

345
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:49,300
- Anytime.
- Stay cool, baby.

346
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:52,400
- Stay safe, Reckless!
- I will!

347
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:07,500
- You know, I miss him already.
- Yeah, he's a cutie pie.

348
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:09,800
- Want to hit this?
- Yeah.

349
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,300
What's wrong?

350
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:16,300
- You OK?
- It's them damn enchiladas.

351
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:21,700
You gonna be all right?

352
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,800
Who's that?

353
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:53,700
Stop it!

354
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:56,900
Stop it!

355
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,800
You're gonna get it, bitch!

356
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:11,100
Lighten up, Demon. You'll feel
a lot better after you shit.

357
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:15,900
I'll feel a lot better when I'm out
of here. This shit box is gross!

358
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:20,300
Watch out for snakes.
They'll crawl up and bite your ass.

359
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,300
Anita? Hey, girl, what's up?

360
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,900
OK. I told you this isn't funny.

361
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:15,800
Now you're gonna get it, bitch.

362
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:21,700
M-Matt's gone. G-George, too.

363
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:24,000
- Are you sure?
- I l-looked.

364
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:26,800
Tina and Eddie
haven't come back either.

365
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,400
- W-where are they?
- It's OK. Calm down, Jake.

366
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:35,500
Let's take this slowly.
Where did Matt say he was going?

367
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:38,100
- He didn't.
- Yes, he did.

368
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:40,700
He went looking for Tina and Eddie.

369
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:43,900
W-where's Tommy?
Wasn't he with you?

370
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:47,900
- And where's Gramps?
- I don't know, Reggie.

371
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:52,200
Why don't you all go inside?
I'm gonna go find everyone.

372
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:55,600
- Jake, I'm putting you in charge.
- Yes.

373
00:56:55,900 --> 00:57:01,800
And you, Reckless, I want you in bed
asleep when I get back, right?

374
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,800
No problem.

375
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:39,400
I'm making your dinner, Junior!
You hearing me, fella?

376
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:43,500
He hurt me, Ma! They hurt me!

377
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,900
I am making your dinner!

378
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:15,200
They hurt me, Ma!
Will you murder 'em?!

379
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:20,500
Chop 'em and kill 'em?!
Do you hear me?

380
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:25,800
Get off that fucking bike
and come here and eat my stew!

381
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:42,900
About time, you fuck wad.

382
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,400
I knew you couldn't pass up
on my stew.

383
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:58,300
You hearing me, Junior?
You talk. You dumb?

384
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:21,700
It's so lonely here.

385
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:26,300
Like we were the only two people left
in the whole world.

386
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:34,000
Maybe we are. Maybe when we get back,
everybody will have disappeared.

387
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,700
I'd like that, wouldn't you?

388
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,500
Robin,

389
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:54,100
w-we've b-been here
nearly eight months now, right?

390
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:01,300
T-that's a long time
to get to know somebody.

391
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:06,200
- Jake, please.
- Sure, sure.

392
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:11,100
We could go anywhere we wanted,

393
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:14,100
and live in the biggest house
in the world.

394
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:19,400
I'd like to live in a little house,
just big enough for the two of us.

395
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:27,200
Only there'll be
more than two of us.

396
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:37,900
I l-like you, Robin...

397
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:42,900
- A lot.
- I like you, too, Jake.

398
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:47,700
You do? A lot?

399
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:51,100
What are you talking about, Jake?

400
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:59,800
I want to be with you.

401
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:04,800
I-I r-really
do want to be with you.

402
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:11,000
I-I w-want to m-make love with you.

403
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:25,900
- I can't...
- I-I didn't mean it.

404
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:28,300
I... I didn't mean it.

405
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:36,400
I-I said I... I didn't mean it!

406
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:26,600
Vi, I-I'd l-like to talk to you.

407
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:31,800
- I n-need to talk to you!
- Can it wait?

408
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:37,900
No.

409
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:15,800
Reggie. Reggie? Come on.
Reggie, wake up.

410
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:18,400
It's time to go to bed.

411
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:21,000
Reggie, wake up. Reggie!

412
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:28,600
OK, your way.

413
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:15,900
Jake, I'm sorry.

414
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:21,500
You know, sometimes, Robin,
you are just so stupid.

415
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,600
What are them nuts up to now?

416
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:54,300
Yo, Tommy. You back?
Tommy, you in here?

417
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:21,200
What is it, Reggie? It's Pam.
What's the matter? What's the matter?

418
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:26,500
- It's me! What is it? What is it?!
- In Tommy's room!

419
01:09:26,700 --> 01:09:31,600
All right. You stay here.
Relax. I'll be right back.

420
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,100
Move!

421
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:02,700
Get up!

422
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:22,400
Shit!

423
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,600
Run! Come on! Let's go!

424
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Help us!

425
01:12:03,100 --> 01:12:04,900
Pam, where are you?!

426
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:44,800
It's OK, Reggie. It's OK. It's OK.

427
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:02,000
God.

428
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:12,400
God.

429
01:16:57,500 --> 01:17:00,800
Yeah! All right! Yeah!

430
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:20,800
Run, Tommy, run!

431
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,600
Run! He'll kill you!

432
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:27,100
- Jason?
- Listen to me!

433
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:30,400
Run! Go! Tommy, get out!

434
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:33,200
- Jason?
- Get out!

435
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:35,700
Listen! Oh, Tommy, go!

436
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:43,100
- Tommy!
- Remember.

437
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:46,200
Don't.

438
01:18:47,900 --> 01:18:50,900
- Remember.
- Die!

439
01:19:21,900 --> 01:19:26,400
Up here, Tommy! Up here! Come on!

440
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:30,300
- Tommy, please!
- Tommy, up here!

441
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:33,600
- Come on!
- Come on! Hurry up!

442
01:19:34,300 --> 01:19:36,300
Tommy, hurry up!

443
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:38,300
Come on, come on!

444
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:41,600
Tommy, you can do it!
Come on, Tommy!

445
01:19:41,700 --> 01:19:45,000
- Tommy, please!
- Tommy, hurry up!

446
01:19:45,100 --> 01:19:47,600
Take my hand. Take my hand!

447
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:52,100
Come on, yeah!
Just one more, Tommy! Come on!

448
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,800
Come on, you can do it!

449
01:22:18,700 --> 01:22:22,800
Please! Please,
somebody help me! Pam!

450
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:48,000
How are you doing?

451
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:07,100
Quite a kid.

452
01:24:11,700 --> 01:24:13,400
We found this on Roy.

453
01:24:15,100 --> 01:24:18,800
The kid who was axed
at the wood pile was Roy's son.

454
01:24:20,700 --> 01:24:25,600
God only knows why Roy kept it
hidden all these years, but he did.

455
01:24:25,900 --> 01:24:28,500
Roy was a real loner.

456
01:24:29,900 --> 01:24:33,900
Never talked much,
not even to the other paramedics.

457
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:40,800
I guess when
he was called to the scene,

458
01:24:40,900 --> 01:24:44,600
and saw that it was his own Joey
all hacked to pieces...

459
01:24:50,300 --> 01:24:52,200
We also found these.

460
