1
00:00:27,145 --> 00:00:29,898
What is your pleasure, sir?

2
00:00:30,398 --> 00:00:33,318
HELLRAISER

3
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:43,578
Jesus wept...

4
00:01:06,017 --> 00:01:10,021
We have such sights to show you...

5
00:01:30,374 --> 00:01:34,462
No, don't do that!
Go to Hell!

6
00:01:56,483 --> 00:02:00,904
HELLBOUND - HELLRAISER II

7
00:06:09,985 --> 00:06:13,822
Ah, the Suffering... the sweet suffering.

8
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:49,691
Welcome back.
- Where am I?

9
00:06:50,608 --> 00:06:55,446
This is the Chanard Institute.
It's a psychiatric hospital.

10
00:06:56,030 --> 00:07:00,368
Psychiatric?
- Remember? You and your boyfriend...

11
00:07:00,952 --> 00:07:05,289
Steve? - Yeah, don't worry about him,
he's ok. We sent him home hours ago.

12
00:07:05,957 --> 00:07:10,878
He had some story to tell.
- Who the fuck are you?

13
00:07:11,712 --> 00:07:15,967
I'm sorry. This job sometimes
makes me forget my manners.

14
00:07:16,968 --> 00:07:21,806
Ronson, Homocide.
I was at your father's house.

15
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:26,727
Dad...

16
00:08:15,693 --> 00:08:17,945
Shit!

17
00:08:18,612 --> 00:08:23,951
Would you talk to me!?
And please, this time no demons, fairy tales, huh?

18
00:08:25,786 --> 00:08:29,206
Fairy tales... fairy tales...

19
00:08:32,876 --> 00:08:37,130
My father didn't believe in fairy tales either.
- What?

20
00:08:40,467 --> 00:08:45,722
Some of them come true, Mr Ronson.
Even the bad ones.

21
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,226
I'm sorry, I...

22
00:08:50,143 --> 00:08:53,313
... I don't understand.

23
00:08:54,981 --> 00:08:57,859
Do you have a family, Mr Ronson ?

24
00:08:59,403 --> 00:09:01,863
Yes?
- Cooch here sir.

25
00:09:01,863 --> 00:09:07,160
We just found another one.
Thought it suffered a little accidental damage.

26
00:09:08,286 --> 00:09:14,751
Anyway, just about the only portable evidence we got around here
apart from the human remains is a mattress.

27
00:09:16,253 --> 00:09:19,881
It looks like someone was messed up real bad on it.
Can we send it downtown?

28
00:09:20,757 --> 00:09:24,678
Cooch, it's evidence.
Tag it and move it.

29
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,682
The mattress...

30
00:09:30,016 --> 00:09:33,603
Julia...

31
00:09:43,571 --> 00:09:47,283
The mind is a labyrinth,
ladies and gentlemen, a puzzle.

32
00:09:47,867 --> 00:09:53,581
And while the paths of the brain are plainly visible,
its ways deceptively apparent, its destinations are unknown.

33
00:09:53,581 --> 00:09:59,128
Its secrets still secret, and, if we are honest,

34
00:09:59,796 --> 00:10:04,884
it is the lure of the labyrinth that draws us to our chosen field.
To unlock those secrets.

35
00:10:05,551 --> 00:10:10,223
Others have been here before us and have left us signs,
but we, as explorers of the mind,

36
00:10:10,223 --> 00:10:16,062
must devote our lives and energies to going further.

37
00:10:17,105 --> 00:10:22,985
to tread the unknown corridors in order to find ultimately,
the final solution.

38
00:10:33,204 --> 00:10:36,832
We have to see, we have to know...

39
00:10:38,167 --> 00:10:46,133
- Dr Chanar, the new arrival is awake,
and appears very distressed.
My part in this is over, tidy for me will you?
Kyle, come with me!

40
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,931
Now, this case, Kyle,
interesting but delicate,

41
00:10:52,556 --> 00:10:56,727
a very traumatised girl,
a witness to multiple murders

42
00:10:56,727 --> 00:11:01,524
Involving members of her own family.
The police brought her here hours ago

43
00:11:01,524 --> 00:11:05,486
but she was lost beyond reach
and now she's back.

44
00:11:05,486 --> 00:11:09,198
What tales I wonder will she bring us
from the other side?

45
00:11:09,198 --> 00:11:12,701
She'll probably be suffering... - No, Kyle.
a speculative mind is an invaluable asset

46
00:11:12,701 --> 00:11:18,332
to the analytic man.
but... all diagnosis begins with

47
00:11:18,957 --> 00:11:22,461
Examination? - Precisely.
You must win from them their trust,

48
00:11:22,461 --> 00:11:25,714
Draw from them their story,
and take from them their pain.

49
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:31,386
Easy!
Ah! No... don't let it... Dad!

50
00:11:31,887 --> 00:11:35,474
Listen, they're gone,

51
00:11:35,474 --> 00:11:38,393
Whatever you saw, they're gone!

52
00:11:38,393 --> 00:11:43,315
I saw it and I saw him
And then I got the box and then I solved it and then they came!

53
00:11:43,815 --> 00:11:49,321
Who came?
The cenobytes, the demons...

54
00:11:53,241 --> 00:11:55,744
I'm Dr Channard.
- Ronson.

55
00:11:55,744 --> 00:11:59,414
My assistant Kyle Macrae.
and this must be Kirsty.

56
00:12:03,752 --> 00:12:08,673
I've read the boy's statement,
quite the adventure they believe they've had.

57
00:12:08,673 --> 00:12:12,427
I'd like to talk to her alone,
do you think?

58
00:12:12,427 --> 00:12:17,599
Yeah, ok. More in your territory
than she is in mine anyhow.

59
00:12:17,849 --> 00:12:20,268
Kirsty.

60
00:12:20,268 --> 00:12:23,772
Dr channard will be taking care of you from now on.

61
00:12:24,606 --> 00:12:29,027
Maybe we can talk tomorrow. Ok?

62
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:35,700
Wait!
That mattress, you've got to destroy that mattress!

63
00:12:36,284 --> 00:12:40,538
See Julia died on it,
and she can come back now like Frank!

64
00:12:42,123 --> 00:12:45,710
Yeah, ok.

65
00:12:51,883 --> 00:12:57,639
You have got to destroy that mattress!
You have got to destroy that mattress!

66
00:13:02,644 --> 00:13:05,730
Mind her.

67
00:13:09,567 --> 00:13:13,905
Detective, I'll be able to help this girl
but I'll need your assistance.

68
00:13:14,822 --> 00:13:20,828
I'm Kyle Macrae. Call me Kyle.
- That cop didn't believe me.

69
00:13:22,747 --> 00:13:27,335
Maybe not. But that doesn't mean
you're not telling the truth.

70
00:13:28,669 --> 00:13:32,507
I'm sorry, Kirsty, I have to
attend to one of my patients.

71
00:13:32,507 --> 00:13:36,844
Kyle will give you something to help
you sleep. We shall speak tomorrow.

72
00:14:34,818 --> 00:14:37,654
Oh Jesus, I'm sorry.

73
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:45,496
Sad, huh? She's been here
six months, she's a complete mystery.

74
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:51,501
No family, no visitors,
she's completely alone.

75
00:14:52,169 --> 00:14:55,672
The nurse named her Tiffany
- What's her real name?

76
00:14:55,672 --> 00:15:02,179
She never speaks, all she does
is solve puzzles. - Why puzzles?

77
00:15:03,013 --> 00:15:07,934
We don't know, but Dr Chanard thinks it
might be a good thing. Maybe beneath her withdrawal

78
00:15:07,934 --> 00:15:12,272
she's putting something in order.

79
00:15:12,272 --> 00:15:15,859
Or opening doors...
- what?

80
00:15:16,443 --> 00:15:22,115
Doesn't matter. Anyway, let's concentrate
on you for the moment. I want you to take a couple of these.

81
00:15:24,451 --> 00:15:29,372
I'm not crazy Kyle. Those aren't
gonna help. - they're only to help you...

82
00:15:30,206 --> 00:15:33,126
...sleep.

83
00:16:38,691 --> 00:16:41,777
I am in Hell. Help me.

84
00:17:58,437 --> 00:18:03,025
And how are we feeling today? Better?
Good, good good good.

85
00:18:03,817 --> 00:18:07,362
Pleasant day? Pleasant day...

86
00:18:11,533 --> 00:18:15,203
105 years, and he still doesn't know my name!

87
00:19:08,339 --> 00:19:13,303
Please! Get them off me!

88
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:27,942
Kirsty? Kirsty, Are you all right?

89
00:19:28,943 --> 00:19:33,448
I had a visitor.
What? Here? Who?

90
00:19:35,533 --> 00:19:40,788
It was my father, he's alone and he's still suffering.

91
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:49,213
Kirsty, your father's dead.
- My father's dead, and he's alone and he's still suffering!

92
00:19:53,551 --> 00:19:57,471
Dr Channard, I'll get Dr Chanard.
You take it easy, I'm sure he can help.

93
00:19:59,056 --> 00:20:02,643
He got a ticket to Hell?

94
00:20:11,152 --> 00:20:18,159
Officer Cooch? Yes, Dr Channard.
You've spoken to Ronson? Yes, that's right.

95
00:20:18,909 --> 00:20:24,582
The mattress. No, I'll meet you by the
side entrance. No no, my house.

96
00:20:24,582 --> 00:20:31,880
Yes, let me make that clear. The house,
not the hospital. Yes. Fine. Thankyou.

97
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:36,927
Dr Chanard...

98
00:20:41,181 --> 00:20:46,353
This... all must have been going on forever.

99
00:20:48,564 --> 00:20:55,779
Kirsty...
- The part I know about...
The part that destroyed my family.

100
00:20:57,823 --> 00:21:00,951
That must have started
with my uncle Frank...

101
00:21:01,285 --> 00:21:06,164
I'm brother Frank.
- It was him and my father's wife...

102
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:21,012
It was Frank and Julia.
I don't know when, but they must have been with each other.

103
00:21:30,981 --> 00:21:34,651
But there's more...
There was a box. It was a puzzle box.

104
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:42,909
And Frank must have solved it.

105
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:48,123
It was a gateway... Hell was what he wanted.

106
00:21:48,748 --> 00:21:52,168
And Hell was what he got.

107
00:21:58,758 --> 00:22:03,138
Somehow... I don't know

108
00:22:04,806 --> 00:22:09,185
Franck came back to life.

109
00:22:20,947 --> 00:22:27,036
It was Julia, that bitch...
She brought him men to make him stronger.

110
00:22:29,122 --> 00:22:33,084
So she could have him again.

111
00:22:34,544 --> 00:22:38,965
Kirsty, it's Frank.
It's Uncle Frank. You remember?

112
00:22:39,882 --> 00:22:43,970
Come to Daddy!
No! Let go of me!

113
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:54,313
And I made a deal: I'd lead them to Frank
if they left me alone.

114
00:22:54,897 --> 00:22:58,901
And I ran to warn Daddy to get out of there
Out of that house...

115
00:22:58,901 --> 00:23:02,655
...but when I got there,
oh God, they'd murdered him.

116
00:23:03,322 --> 00:23:09,578
Frank and Julia, they'd taken his skin
and given it to Frank.

117
00:23:11,163 --> 00:23:14,500
Come to Daddy!

118
00:23:17,086 --> 00:23:21,257
But Frank betrayed her
and left her to the Cenobytes.

119
00:23:21,257 --> 00:23:26,095
Nothing personal baby...
- she died on that mattress,

120
00:23:26,095 --> 00:23:29,932
And the Cenobytes came....

121
00:23:42,861 --> 00:23:46,448
Do you believe me?
Am I crazy?

122
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:54,289
That is not a word I choose to employ, Kirsty.
But clearly there is much we must discuss.

123
00:23:55,541 --> 00:23:58,377
Much we must investigate...

124
00:23:58,877 --> 00:24:02,381
Much I have to do.

125
00:25:38,476 --> 00:25:42,397
Weird...

126
00:25:55,326 --> 00:25:59,080
Weird!

127
00:26:07,672 --> 00:26:14,595
Jesus Christ... Jesus Christ!

128
00:26:54,051 --> 00:26:57,805
Please! Get them off me!

129
00:27:08,148 --> 00:27:12,653
"Children of the Vortex:
Puberty Link with Psychic Phenomena?"

130
00:27:16,657 --> 00:27:20,827
"Is Death the 4th Dimension?"

131
00:27:26,083 --> 00:27:29,920
Jesus, he must have been
into this shit for years...

132
00:27:37,844 --> 00:27:41,097
What is he doing?

133
00:27:41,097 --> 00:27:43,433
What is this?

134
00:27:43,934 --> 00:27:47,354
Get them off me!

135
00:27:50,523 --> 00:27:53,109
Come Mr Browning.

136
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:03,203
Please...

137
00:28:12,962 --> 00:28:16,049
Get them off me...

138
00:28:18,134 --> 00:28:22,889
Please, sit down.

139
00:28:38,821 --> 00:28:42,825
Get them off me!

140
00:29:44,386 --> 00:29:48,223
Get them off me!

141
00:30:02,738 --> 00:30:07,910
Get them off me!

142
00:31:18,646 --> 00:31:21,733
Help me...

143
00:32:04,775 --> 00:32:07,778
Help me...

144
00:32:10,114 --> 00:32:13,701
Help me...

145
00:33:14,178 --> 00:33:17,431
Do not be scared of me.

146
00:34:08,231 --> 00:34:11,818
Well?

147
00:35:03,286 --> 00:35:06,539
I'm cold.

148
00:35:28,477 --> 00:35:35,151
Well?
Yes... yes, you look...

149
00:35:36,235 --> 00:35:38,904
Strange?

150
00:35:39,822 --> 00:35:42,491
Surreal?

151
00:35:43,075 --> 00:35:46,162
Nightmarish? -No, no...

152
00:35:47,663 --> 00:35:51,584
You look...

153
00:35:58,507 --> 00:36:02,428
Divine...

154
00:37:11,997 --> 00:37:14,666
There.

155
00:37:24,551 --> 00:37:28,263
Well.
-Well?

156
00:39:01,355 --> 00:39:06,110
Now all we need is skin.

157
00:39:17,538 --> 00:39:20,207
What's wrong with you?

158
00:39:22,876 --> 00:39:26,880
It's all true...

159
00:39:27,965 --> 00:39:30,634
Get dressed. I've got to
get you out of here.

160
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:37,474
Shit!
- I'll get your clothes.

161
00:39:37,474 --> 00:39:41,061
I can do that. I'm a doctor.

162
00:39:45,065 --> 00:39:50,487
She was horrible... she had no skin! No skin!!

163
00:39:51,988 --> 00:39:56,993
Julia doesn't deserve to come back.
It's not fair.

164
00:40:04,584 --> 00:40:08,755
I need that box.

165
00:40:09,798 --> 00:40:13,969
Chanard has boxes.
- Like in my story?

166
00:40:13,969 --> 00:40:17,097
- Yes.
- I'm going.

167
00:40:17,097 --> 00:40:20,934
Wait a minute! What do you mean I'm going?
To the house?

168
00:40:20,934 --> 00:40:25,730
Are you crazy?
- Well, I don't know Kyle, you're the fucking expert!

169
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:32,737
Well think about this!
-Kyle, when I think, I hurt.
OK? Now I'm going.

170
00:40:33,279 --> 00:40:37,283
Why?
-Because I'm going to get my father!

171
00:40:38,743 --> 00:40:41,704
Two seconds. Just two seconds, don't move.

172
00:40:46,042 --> 00:40:48,795
OK, let's go.

173
00:40:48,795 --> 00:40:51,965
Kyle, you don't have to do this.

174
00:40:55,468 --> 00:40:58,304
I know.

175
00:43:35,502 --> 00:43:39,631
Kirsty ! Now we're not going to do anything
until I check the house.

176
00:43:41,132 --> 00:43:44,719
Wait for me here. alright?

177
00:44:18,419 --> 00:44:22,590
I'm sorry I startled you. I had to stop you
going in there because

178
00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:25,259
I knew you'd cry out...

179
00:44:25,802 --> 00:44:29,013
It's just terrible...

180
00:44:29,764 --> 00:44:33,434
Is it still there?

181
00:44:35,102 --> 00:44:38,773
I don't know.

182
00:45:37,164 --> 00:45:40,751
Was I right?
Is it terrible?

183
00:45:43,587 --> 00:45:48,842
Yes... this is terrible...

184
00:45:51,261 --> 00:45:57,601
Oh you poor boy, you look awful!
Come here.

185
00:46:08,361 --> 00:46:11,615
Come to mother.

186
00:46:18,538 --> 00:46:21,625
What's your name?
- Kyle.

187
00:46:22,125 --> 00:46:26,796
I'm Julia.

188
00:46:58,578 --> 00:47:01,831
Kyle ?

189
00:47:17,013 --> 00:47:20,516
Kyle !

190
00:47:39,952 --> 00:47:43,372
Not again...

191
00:47:45,875 --> 00:47:50,880
Kirsty, you have surprisingly good taste in men...

192
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:57,136
They didn't tell you did they Kirsty?
They changed the rules of the fairytale.

193
00:47:57,803 --> 00:48:02,808
I'm no longer just the evil stepmother.
Now I'm the evil queen.

194
00:48:04,059 --> 00:48:06,812
So come on! - No!

195
00:48:06,812 --> 00:48:10,149
Take your best shot, so what!

196
00:48:12,067 --> 00:48:15,154
Julia ?

197
00:48:17,323 --> 00:48:22,077
Now it's my turn.

198
00:50:14,522 --> 00:50:18,443
You're sure this is what you want?
- It's what I've always wanted.

199
00:50:18,443 --> 00:50:21,946
I have to see... I have to know...

200
00:51:13,664 --> 00:51:16,333
She's done it!

201
00:51:18,169 --> 00:51:21,672
She certainly has...

202
00:51:25,759 --> 00:51:28,429
It's coming...

203
00:51:28,429 --> 00:51:31,098
It certainly is...

204
00:53:04,607 --> 00:53:07,777
Wait!

205
00:53:19,289 --> 00:53:22,458
No!
- No?

206
00:53:23,042 --> 00:53:27,630
It is not hands that call us...

207
00:53:28,297 --> 00:53:33,052
It is desire...

208
00:55:05,310 --> 00:55:08,230
Ottaward...

209
00:55:22,661 --> 00:55:25,997
Daddy?
Where are you?

210
00:55:33,338 --> 00:55:37,509
Say something! I don't know where you are!
Daddy, I'm coming!

211
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:12,794
Help my daughter, help my daughter...!

212
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:28,643
Help my daughter...

213
00:57:57,147 --> 00:58:01,151
Mommy...!

214
00:58:32,933 --> 00:58:36,269
Somebody please help me!

215
00:58:47,113 --> 00:58:50,533
Ah.. Kirsty...
We thought we'd lost you...

216
00:58:50,533 --> 00:58:53,870
So sweet of you to come back...
- How can it send us back, child,

217
00:58:53,870 --> 00:58:57,123
We're already here...
and so are you!

218
00:59:08,384 --> 00:59:13,223
I didn't open the box!
Didn't open the box... and what was it
last time? Didn't know what the box was?

219
00:59:13,306 --> 00:59:17,811
And yet we do keep finding each other, don't we?

220
00:59:18,394 --> 00:59:22,899
Oh, Kirsty. So eager to play!

221
00:59:22,899 --> 00:59:25,902
So reluctant to admit it!

222
00:59:25,902 --> 00:59:29,322
Perhaps you're teasing us.
Are you teasing us?

223
00:59:29,572 --> 00:59:32,825
I've come for my father!

224
00:59:36,579 --> 00:59:40,500
But he is in his own Hell, child,
and quite unreachable.

225
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:43,836
I don't believe you!

226
00:59:46,339 --> 00:59:52,178
But it's true! He is in his own Hell.
Just as you are in yours.

227
00:59:52,762 --> 00:59:57,183
And what about you?
We have no more surprises.

228
00:59:57,183 --> 01:00:03,272
We've always been here
- but please, feel free, explore.

229
01:00:05,524 --> 01:00:08,861
We have eternity...

230
01:00:08,861 --> 01:00:13,115
to know your flesh...

231
01:01:14,927 --> 01:01:20,599
Come. I have such sights to show you...

232
01:02:11,566 --> 01:02:14,903
You must have opened the box, didn't you,
and you've got to close it.

233
01:02:14,903 --> 01:02:18,239
You know how the puzzle works.
Get us out!

234
01:02:19,491 --> 01:02:23,828
Look. We're alone in all of this,
and we have to help each other.

235
01:02:24,746 --> 01:02:28,082
We have to help each other!

236
01:02:30,668 --> 01:02:33,588
Yeah?

237
01:03:16,547 --> 01:03:19,300
Oh my God...

238
01:03:20,384 --> 01:03:24,805
No, this is mine. The god that sent me back.

239
01:03:26,307 --> 01:03:31,896
The god I serve in this world and yours.

240
01:03:33,147 --> 01:03:37,318
The god of flesh, hunger and desire.

241
01:03:37,902 --> 01:03:42,823
My god, Leviathan!
Lord of the labyrinth!

242
01:04:00,007 --> 01:04:03,177
Help me doctor!
Help my daughter, can you help her?

243
01:04:05,179 --> 01:04:09,433
But this is what you wanted!
This is what you wanted to see.

244
01:04:09,433 --> 01:04:13,687
This is what you wanted to know.
And here it is!

245
01:04:14,271 --> 01:04:18,192
Leviathan !

246
01:04:25,949 --> 01:04:30,203
Help me!
- Why do you think I was allowed to come back?

247
01:04:33,206 --> 01:04:37,627
It wanted souls. And I brought you!

248
01:04:41,715 --> 01:04:44,968
And you wanted to know!

249
01:04:47,721 --> 01:04:51,224
Now you know.

250
01:04:51,224 --> 01:04:53,894
And I wanted everything!

251
01:04:53,894 --> 01:04:56,813
Now everybody's happy.

252
01:05:04,070 --> 01:05:07,657
Goodbye doctor...

253
01:05:30,930 --> 01:05:34,434
The house, that's my father's house!

254
01:05:38,021 --> 01:05:41,274
Tiffany, Tiffany...
I'm sorry, but I have to go in there.

255
01:05:43,109 --> 01:05:47,113
Look, I want you to wait for me
but if I'm not back soon, real soon,

256
01:05:47,113 --> 01:05:52,618
I want you to get out
and I want you to get home.

257
01:08:17,929 --> 01:08:22,267
"I am in Hell. Help me"
- Dad...

258
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:53,715
What's the matter, Kirsty ?
It's only Frank, it's only Uncle Frank.

259
01:08:54,716 --> 01:08:58,302
Didn't you get my message?

260
01:08:59,721 --> 01:09:05,893
Oh, Kirsty, so ripe in your confusion
so lucious in your pain.

261
01:09:07,311 --> 01:09:11,232
No it can't be!
O come on, Kirsty, grow up!

262
01:09:11,816 --> 01:09:15,653
When you're dead, you're fuckin' dead!

263
01:09:22,243 --> 01:09:26,664
Don't be naughty, Kirsty,
or I'll have to punish you first...

264
01:09:28,499 --> 01:09:31,669
perhaps you'd like that.

265
01:09:34,755 --> 01:09:38,843
Now would you like that?

266
01:09:41,011 --> 01:09:46,350
Oh, don't be shy, beautiful.
Ghosts aren't jealous.

267
01:09:47,685 --> 01:09:51,772
This is my Hell

268
01:09:52,356 --> 01:09:55,943
and they're here to tease me,
and they promise forever and never deliver.

269
01:09:56,527 --> 01:09:59,947
That's why I sent for you, Kirsty!

270
01:10:15,796 --> 01:10:20,050
Ok, ok! don't hurt me,
I'll do anything!

271
01:10:31,562 --> 01:10:34,898
I'd rather burn!

272
01:10:34,898 --> 01:10:38,485
No!

273
01:11:06,179 --> 01:11:10,850
No, not my skin!

274
01:11:14,688 --> 01:11:18,525
No, not my face!

275
01:11:27,367 --> 01:11:30,453
Well, well.

276
01:11:33,832 --> 01:11:37,502
Family reunion?
- Julia!

277
01:11:38,795 --> 01:11:42,465
Frank.
I knew you'd come.

278
01:11:42,966 --> 01:11:46,886
You knew? - You're a girl
who always keeps her promises.

279
01:11:49,055 --> 01:11:52,308
Oh, I do.

280
01:11:56,980 --> 01:12:01,734
I do. - I know just
how much I mean to you.

281
01:12:03,736 --> 01:12:08,074
Come here. Kiss me.

282
01:12:08,574 --> 01:12:12,829
and then we'll have a real family reunion.

283
01:12:14,413 --> 01:12:19,085
Come here.
You belong to me.

284
01:12:51,117 --> 01:12:54,703
Nothing personal, babe.

285
01:13:13,555 --> 01:13:16,225
Which way, Tiffany?

286
01:13:21,563 --> 01:13:24,149
Hang on!

287
01:14:10,529 --> 01:14:15,492
And to think I hesitated.

288
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:59,327
You never could hold oin to anything
for very long, could you Kirsty?

289
01:15:08,628 --> 01:15:12,507
Tiffany ! Reach for my arm!

290
01:15:13,383 --> 01:15:17,470
Reach for my arm! Tiffany!

291
01:15:32,944 --> 01:15:36,447
No... no Tiffany, don't trust her!
Tiffany, no!

292
01:16:35,172 --> 01:16:41,261
Daddy, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry...

293
01:17:20,550 --> 01:17:23,720
Tiffany, we're getting out of here.

294
01:17:45,158 --> 01:17:49,162
Oh, Jesus...
So many of them!

295
01:17:58,504 --> 01:18:01,716
The doctor... is in.

296
01:18:01,716 --> 01:18:05,178
shit!

297
01:18:15,688 --> 01:18:19,358
I recommend amputation...

298
01:18:51,557 --> 01:18:56,312
Oh... no boxes!
Such a shame.

299
01:18:57,313 --> 01:19:01,317
No more delays Kirsty,
No more teasing.

300
01:19:01,317 --> 01:19:03,903
Time to play.

301
01:19:03,903 --> 01:19:09,074
Time to play.
- Wait!

302
01:19:09,742 --> 01:19:13,746
No more deals Kirsty!
It is your flesh we want to experience,

303
01:19:13,746 --> 01:19:20,919
not your skill at bargaining!
- No deals. Just information.

304
01:19:22,254 --> 01:19:26,175
Just information!
- Go on!

305
01:19:26,925 --> 01:19:30,304
But trick us again, child

306
01:19:30,304 --> 01:19:34,558
and your suffering will be legendary
even in Hell!

307
01:19:41,773 --> 01:19:45,027
What is this?

308
01:19:48,655 --> 01:19:53,702
Someone else you think escaped us
like Frank?

309
01:19:53,702 --> 01:19:57,706
No, this one didn't escape.
It's you!

310
01:19:59,625 --> 01:20:03,754
Nonsense! I...
- It's you!

311
01:20:03,754 --> 01:20:08,884
You haven't always been this way,
You were human.

312
01:20:09,718 --> 01:20:12,971
Remember...

313
01:20:12,971 --> 01:20:17,142
Remember all your confusions...
Think!

314
01:20:17,142 --> 01:20:21,229
- Enough!
Wait.

315
01:20:26,484 --> 01:20:31,323
I... remember!

316
01:20:33,575 --> 01:20:38,496
You were all human...

317
01:20:45,754 --> 01:20:49,090
Tiffany !

318
01:20:51,426 --> 01:20:55,346
Come...

319
01:20:59,601 --> 01:21:03,021
Come... Tiffany...

320
01:21:06,524 --> 01:21:11,696
I'm your doctor.
I'm here to help you.

321
01:21:20,204 --> 01:21:23,708
Ah.... good! A fight.

322
01:22:25,019 --> 01:22:29,857
I'm taking over this operation.

323
01:22:31,275 --> 01:22:35,446
You girls will be my first patients.

324
01:23:40,552 --> 01:23:44,347
I have to go back.
I have to finish the puzzle.

325
01:23:45,015 --> 01:23:49,352
Tiffany what are you talking about?
- they remembered and they got better.

326
01:24:33,229 --> 01:24:37,817
Tiffany what are you doing?
What is this thing? what does it do?

327
01:25:09,932 --> 01:25:13,769
Oh my god...

328
01:25:42,047 --> 01:25:45,134
It's alright, my child.
I'm gonna help you now.

329
01:25:45,134 --> 01:25:50,806
Can you help her?
These puzzles are consuming her life.

330
01:25:50,806 --> 01:25:54,810
Help me, doctor?
Can you help my daughter? Can you help her?

331
01:26:01,567 --> 01:26:05,404
Mommy!

332
01:26:07,739 --> 01:26:11,493
No!

333
01:26:12,077 --> 01:26:16,081
Tiffany I see now.
It's a puzzle, isn't it?

334
01:26:16,081 --> 01:26:19,626
It's a puzzle...

335
01:27:09,801 --> 01:27:12,887
Tiffany!

336
01:27:18,226 --> 01:27:22,397
Ah, girls! And how are we feeling today?

337
01:27:31,656 --> 01:27:39,080
You have your whole lives behind you now,
No anaesthetic at hand. Shame.

338
01:28:00,351 --> 01:28:07,066
Surgery is open, Tiffany.
What's today's agenda?

339
01:28:08,943 --> 01:28:13,280
Ah yes... evisceration!

340
01:28:49,066 --> 01:28:51,985
We knew you'd come back.

341
01:29:45,205 --> 01:29:50,543
Your case is closed, Tiffany!
I'm afraid it's terminal!

342
01:30:39,759 --> 01:30:43,262
Trust me!

343
01:31:39,818 --> 01:31:43,572
Kirsty!

344
01:32:00,756 --> 01:32:04,760
Tiffany! We've got to get out of here!

345
01:34:34,825 --> 01:34:37,411
Whose is all this shit?

346
01:34:37,912 --> 01:34:40,915
Not our problem!

347
01:35:00,350 --> 01:35:03,103
Hey! Take a look at this!

348
01:35:56,823 --> 01:36:00,410
What is your pleasure, sir ?
