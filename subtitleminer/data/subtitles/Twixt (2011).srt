1
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:41,800
There was once upon a time a town,
not far from a big city.

2
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,200
Road went through, but there were
only a few business

3
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,450
a coffee shop, a hardware store,
a sheriff office.

4
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,700
and all kinds of people..

5
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:57,350
vagrants, runaway teens...

6
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:01,700
religious fanatic, retired seniors who ...

7
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:07,550
well, it was the town of those who
want to be left alone. .

8
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:10,350
and so they were...

9
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:19,200
the sheriff, Bobby LaGrange, went
there for years...

10
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:22,732
also made wood novelty.

11
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,250
but the most astonishing about
the town was ...

12
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,800
an old bell free with the clock
tower with seven faces.

13
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:36,950
You could see the time from anywhere
in the town of Swan Valley.

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,900
the faces consistently show different times.

15
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,750
No question, something evil
is biding there.

16
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,850
perhaps it was because the terrible
murder happen years before.

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,750
too terrible to talk about. But
would haunted the town.

18
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,950
or perhaps it was those teenagers who
gather across the lake.

19
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,150
some people thought they did bad things.

20
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,500
They worship Satan.

21
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,850
the way their dress, the
music they played...

22
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,350
and their mysterious leader known
only as Flamingo.

23
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,700
a seducer of innocent youth...

24
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,700
some said...far worse.

25
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,550
in this set of certain time...
the stream writers...

26
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,650

27
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,250

00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,900
about witchcraft.

30
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:45,200
Excuse me, do you know where
the bookstore is?

31
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:48,550
There is no bookstore around here.

47
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:23,200

48

00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:45,050
Would you mind to read some of my stuff?

while back.

55
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,714
Many folks thinks that the town is haunted

56
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,850

00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:16,400
because it makes any sense? I had to
break this spell of this downward spiral

94
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,450
There's the one way to do and I'm trying
to do it. I'm not goanna write another witch book

95
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,900
and That's it. than. I am going to
do something for me.

96
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,250
you have done it before

97
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,100
When you were not drinking. before Vicky's accident.

98
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,845

99
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,800
You can do these. I... I knew what you mean about...

100
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:44,700
you just had to do it one more time. Just
write the damn thing, then you can take time

101
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:50,700
and write what you really want to write. I understand, I get it. you know I did.

102
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,000

and I not goanna write witch story anymore.

104

105

118
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:44,350

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,912
but you may call me V..
- V. that's nice.

120
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:53,650

because I tall.

123
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:05,150
I know who you are. You wrote those
witch stories.

124
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:08,767
and you're here to sign a book in hardware
store.

125
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,150
I love your books

126
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,500
specially the part where Elizabeth says,

127
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:17,650
'forsake me never, because I will untied
you from my grave'.

128
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,000
That is my favorite part.

129
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,700
Thanks, I like your look.

130
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,300
oh ...yeah.

131
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,950
just the way I dress.

132
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,600
you're scared of me yet?
- What?

133
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,400
Yes.

134
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,000
a little.

135
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:45,900
that clock chime midnight three
times already.

136
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,800
keeping track time right here is pointless.

137
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:52,129
That's why Mr. book signing.

138
00:15:56,350 --> 00:16:01,050
that old hotel is open. Come on
I buy you soda...sweetie

139
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,400
I have a daughter at your age.

140
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:07,800
No, I don't think that a pretty good idea.
- Why not?

141
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,350
better we go to hardware and talk about
My story.

142
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,500
tell me now.
- No, I can't.

143
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,000
come on.

144
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:30,450
We are open. Come in.

145
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:35,950
I go for walk, I guess I got lost.

146
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:42,950
What happen to that little girl?
- What little girl?

147
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:48,650
is the restaurant open?
- restaurant is always open.

148
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,800
With that old clock tower and all of those
faces, you can get breakfast any time.

149
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,650
Yes.

150
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:01,350
Well, Mr...
- Baltimore.

151
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:03,850
Damned clock.

152
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,300
that clock has never told the correct time.

153
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:09,050
just you wait but. You will goanna
be very surprise.

154
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:11,650
There's all is the important thing

155
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,000
and that's working beautifully.

156
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,615
better than before.
- I just have a beer.

157
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:22,138
Melvin is the bell custodian, he
assign the big clock at church

158
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:25,400
It is a hopeless job. And a real burden.

159
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,050
that old mechanism does not keep
it for a long time more .

160
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,250
I go up there every day.

161
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,023
the seven faces look at me like I was the
one who invented the day and light savings time.

162
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,863
you know who thought up, hey?

163
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:40,650
Hitler. And, you know who support him now?

164
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,614
doctors. And you know why? golf

165
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,850
they want more time golf. That is
what all about.

166
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,550
You cannot change the time. The time
will changes you.

167
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:56,850
don't you' agree? What do you think
about the daylight savings time?

168
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:01,350
I never really thought that.
- When do you think about it?

169
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,650
That is the grave.
- Grave?

170
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,800
you can walk on it. don't worry.
The whole floor is a grave.

171
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:17,700
Really?
- There are twelve children buried right down here.

172
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,900
13 children murdered in cold blood.

173
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:23,050
Well, actually he is right.

174
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,800
it has been dozen but one get away and
she was damn.

175
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,200
When was that?
- Long Time ago.

176
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:37,300
The clock is fixed.

177
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,478
The clock is fixed.

178
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,900
got you, devil.

179
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,817
she has bite.
- suck it out...suck it out

180
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:04,250
Damn ...it hurt.

181
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,800
what is the time she bite you. 4 o'clock.
- It isn't 4 o’clock.

182
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,948
the clock said four o'clock.
- are you kidding me?

183
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,000
It is the devil.

184
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:01,550
is the dead little kid.

185
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:26,350
you?

186
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:32,550
why are you here?

187
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,600
what she have told you?
- nothing. What should she tell me?

188
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:41,750
go away, old man...you know

189
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,200
Children...hurry.

190
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,511
the moon is going down...
time for nap.

191
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:00,350

192
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,800

00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:29,650

198
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,450
I know you're there. are you awake?
- What? It wasn't me.

199
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,350

What is the matter?
- If you're awake? It's me.

202
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,650
What is the matter? Everything okay?

I need a second. oh my god..
What have you done?

206
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:52,650
Yeah?
That?

207
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,800
do you know how much it's worth?
- Yeah, I do.

208
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:57,150
160,000 dollars.

209
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:00,000
No, it's worth a lot more than that.
It's priceless.

210
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:03,750
you shouldn't be touching it. How did you get
into my safe? just calm down.

212
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:12,850
you think. I don't think it's funny. It is a nice book, by the way

213
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:15,050
Yes, Whitman only had...

214
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,750
there's only four on private hand okay.
Understand what that's mean?

215
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,700

257
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,700
let me talk to him.

258
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:45,500
Bobby, it's Hall Baltimore.

259
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:49,150
I could get your story and the image of that poor dead girl out of my mind.

260
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:52,200
Really?
- Yes, I dreamed the whole night.

261
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:54,750
.. that I would like to write the book with you.

262
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,450
so, you're the sheriff and you make bat house

263
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,950
Yes, and that is a bird house.

264
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,600
totally different. .

265
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:12,100
The bats and birds know which is which.

266
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,400
normally I write about witchcraft ...

267
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:18,600
but vampires are actually witches that suck blood.

268
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,800
they are entirely different.

269
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:22,950
we really have one here.

270
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:26,550
There are no witches he, as long as I can remember.

271
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:30,200
I could ask to my sister. she is older than eighty.

272
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,050
welcome in my office. Come on have a sit..

273
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,950
imagine this. Written by...

274
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,100
Hall Baltimore and Bobby LaGrange. It's sweet.

275
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:46,400
Or, Hall Baltimore with an idea by Bobby LaGrange.

276
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:50,050
What do you mean with an idea by? I got a lot more
then the idea by.

277
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,250
I got a great character.
- Yes, who?

278
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:56,550
Bobby LaGrange.
- come down. Tell me what you got.

279
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,150
I got the vampires executions. .

280
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,850
and that will sell.

281
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:05,250
Not bad. go on.

282
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:10,100
The girl, who is she? is she just runaway?

283
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,050
or just a 12 or 13 years old girl ...

284
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,250
which looks much older than she really is.

285
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,600
A Vagrant? A homeless?

286
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,200
Why the wooden stack?
- Yes, why?

287
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:22,550
Or, what that's kill her?

288
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,250
Or was it something that was add a later?

289
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,500
as a calling card of the real killer?

290
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:34,250
you see, one end the one smooth.

291
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,600
No fingerprints.

292
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:43,550
and then it was press injurer...Slowly.

293
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,850
Not jab, not stab.

294
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,150
almost it was done by
some kind of a machine.

295
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:52,350
a machine?
- Yes.

296
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:55,700
that why I called it a vampires execution.

297
00:31:55,900 --> 00:32:00,150
I think she was killed by ...an electric chair ...

298
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,700
or vampires.

299
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:09,850
an executions device, designed especially by and for vampires ...

300
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,400
that's different...I wonder what it will look alike.

301
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,450
While I thought of that. I have a model.

302
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,500
Ready?
- ready

303
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:27,850
how about that

304
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:31,650

305
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:40,650
you' love it

306
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,950
How can I help you, Hall.
- hay Sam ...

307
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,800
remember you said if I come with a bullet proof
idea, you would give me an advance?

308
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:53,150
another advance.
- Yes, another more

309
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:57,250
a bullet proof idea come with meat on the bone.

310
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,950
not like fog on the lake.
you know

311
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:03,000
well no one can better metaphors quite like you Sam.

312
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:06,450

313
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,800
vampires?

314
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:12,000
and the main character get this...
she is a little girl, a murdered girl.

315
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:14,400
beautiful.
- Beautiful, yes, but she just a kid.

316
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:17,050
No, I meant that's beautiful...that's she get murdered.

317
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,600
but it must be a good of story.
Not a lot of hassle with the style bullshit.

318
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,900
Tell me, how does that execution being playing up?

319
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:28,050
I will find out. I mean it's a great...great twixt ending.

320
00:34:28,115 --> 00:34:28,950
With heart.

321
00:34:29,051 --> 00:34:31,650
with tons of heart, I'll give complete
outline in the morning

322
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:35,550
but you'll got me a check
to Denise right the way.

323
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,900
I'm not kidding around, in facts the bank wire transfer will be better. It’s an emergency

324
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:40,450
I am thinking about it. It is not bullet proof.

325
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:44,950
but Hall Baltimore, master in the witchcraft doing a vampire story

326
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,300
It is not a bad.
- Not at all bad.

327
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,600
if it got and ending.
- It's got an ending.

328
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:51,950
a bullet proof ending.
- a bullet proof

329
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,300
but Sam, you got tight my wife over
right? okay

330
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:59,300
this is why I'm doing it right?
25 grand’s.

331
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:02,400
okay, you know what I am going to do?
I goanna wire Denise 10,000 dollar

332
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:05,600
25.000.
That is great. I really appreciate it.

333
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,200
I said that I wire Denise 10,000 dollars...

334
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:11,100
but I need the outline in the morning or I will goanna stop the payment.

335
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:13,800
Sam?
- And no fog on the lake...

336
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,550
The night was ... humid.

337
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:35,200
The night was ... cloudy.

338
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:40,300
fog. A Mist ... mist descends ...

339
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:45,850
on the lake Mini ...

340
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,400
More WANIPALUKi.

341
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:53,200
The fog ... floated out like

342
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:57,750
Virginia's silent ...

343
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:03,300
dream.

344
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,700
No, that something else.

345
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:11,950
The fog on the lake ...

346
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:18,500
The fog on the lake ... just to torture Sam.

347
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:21,900
the scent floats out like ...

348
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,900
tears.

349
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:28,050
on a whale? No.

350
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:34,650
The fog on the lake...
looks like a razor blade.

351
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:39,150
The fog on the lake remind me my
first wife.

352
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:43,400
it disappear with the time.
I lost my mind.

353
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:45,750
And now I have a lisp.

354
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:49,950
And now I suddenly turning into a
black basketball player.

355
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,850
she ... was ...

356
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:00,650
I typing such as a basket ... a gay
basketball player from the sixties.

357
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,900
I like short short.

358
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:06,550
there are reveal but they are confortable.
They help me to jump.

359
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,250
there was no fog on the lake.

360
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,500
Swann Valley, sheriff department.
Deputy Arbus speaking.

361
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:23,200
Arbus, the writer fella told me to go to ...

362
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:25,750
well, he is still not back here in his motel.

363
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:30,250
If you see him, tell him I wait
another thirty minutes...

364
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,900
and that's it... I got to go.
- Alright, sheriff.

365
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:37,200
Why the door is not lock, Arbus?

366
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:39,863
I have left them open for you, PJ.

367
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:45,000
what happened to your diet?
- I was wondering when you get here
with my hamburgers.

368
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:49,300
feeling like to play cards?
sure, but when you goanna pay up?

369
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,800
PJ, get the cord here will you.
- Okay. .

370
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:04,450
don't ever walk into the morgue
without unannounced

371
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,750
My heart can't handle it.
- Sorry, I have knock..

372
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,400
well, the sheriff is over at your motel ...

373
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:15,650
and he said
I only be here for thirty minutes

374
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:18,100
okay, thanks.

375
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:20,750
you owe me eighteen buck, Arbus.

376
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:45,450
Snooze, Ropopose, Sleep all ...

377
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:51,850
Night all ... and you didn't put this
in your list. But I like it. I thought it was good.

378
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,200
Sleeping All.
- Just what I needed.

379
00:40:57,650 --> 00:41:00,800
Are we not working together? That is,
after all, what you said.

380
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:03,350
and you're just goanna put a sleeps.

381
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,200
then I have a chance to dream.

382
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:09,850
but you didn't read the label’s.
- yes it is.

383
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:19,600
this is how you write? I thought that
all city writers...

384
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:23,950
just get itself was drunk and wrote
some kind of trance
- we do...we do but...

385
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:28,100
there is bullet proof of ending out there
and I know just a guy to get me there ...

386
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:40,050
do you know a doctor that's can give
me prescription for a real..real one?

387
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,400
I cannot do that. I'm a public officer.

388
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:49,250
what a lies..lies. By Bobby LaGrange.

389
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:55,350
her's skin was so fresh as cream, comes
out from the butter ...

390
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:59,650
under the lace by teenage witch

391
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:29,550
What keep bringing you back?

392
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,600
I'm trying to solve a mystery.

393
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,900
I have waiting for you, my friend.

394
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:40,300
here, in her tomb.

395
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:52,250
after you.

396
00:42:57,550 --> 00:43:01,600
here you are... Edgar Allan Poe,
so..if  you...

397
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:05,750
How can I help?

398
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:09,250
well... I got have no ending.

399
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:12,500
did you know the deacons once corresponding
with me ...

400
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:18,800
concerning on the technique ...
write the ending first. And work it backwards.

401
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:28,350
What did you need? Length?

402
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:33,350
40 to 50 lines ... per page.
200 pages minimum.

403
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,600
providence?
- Beauty.

404
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,550
The tone?
- they will tell you.

405
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,900
these point has being settle...

406
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:44,900
shall we consider the reframe?
- right

407
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:50,250
I think the bell tower coming to me.

408
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:54,650
the reframe must be brief.
It my own work, almost famous...

409
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,418
it just only a single word is the best..
I'm afraid.

410
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,650
never more.

411
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,600
The difficulty arose from the
presumption that the word ...

412
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:05,900
could only monopoly be spoken by
a human being.

413
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:10,850
then immediately a rose an idea of non
reason creature capable to speak ...

414
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,250
and, very naturally of parrot suggest of
itself.

415
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:17,950
but this idea was replaced immediately
by raven equally ...

416
00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:21,650
capable of speech of the bird
announcing ...

417
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:25,150
infinity more keeping within terms

418
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:30,151
this all is in the price of that
very bottle of Irish whisky?

419
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:33,400
Yes, of course, please continue..

420
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:37,150
So, I asked myself ...

421
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,550
of all melancholic topics ...

422
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:44,952
what according the universal understanding
of mankind is the most tragic?

423
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:48,650
death.

424
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,050
and when it is most tragic
melancholic topic ...

425
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,200
most poetical?

426
00:44:55,350 --> 00:44:59,900
when there is most loosely allude
itself ... to beauty.

427
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:04,250
the death of a beautiful girl ..

428
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:09,300
is unquestionly the most poetical
topic in the world.

429
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:16,850
equally it is beyond the lips of
best beauty of the topic

430
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,700
of those a man ...
who loved her.

431
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:33,450
so ... I had to combine these two ideas ...

432
00:45:33,850 --> 00:45:36,350
of the lover who lamented about
his dead mistress ...

433
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,350
and the raven' continuously using the
word "Nevermore"

434
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:42,250
in a poem of 100 lines.

435
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,300
and "nevermore" was the conclusion
of each dancer ...

436
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:47,950
in a poem with a melancholic tone.

437
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,600
How do you find the ending?

438
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:03,711
Your story is a tragedy.

439
00:46:04,850 --> 00:46:08,550
it happened here at the old
Chikering hotel where I once slept.

440
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:14,950
There were many children in the town.
orphans some ware, the lost children

441
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:20,650
and before long they were taking in
protection by pastor Alan Floyd.

442
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,743
he was a kindly man, adopt this kid

443
00:46:23,292 --> 00:46:26,259
everyone was agrees that he is
good character...

444
00:46:26,354 --> 00:46:30,704
as his capitalism, another god
and goodness

445
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,400
And one night it happened.

446
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:49,100
one of his children was missing.
and then what it came out.

447
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,200
whom I miss here?
who is it?

448
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,800
Peter?
Where ...

449
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:58,311
he is did surely not cross the lake.

450
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:18,500
never ever go with the people
across of the lake.

451
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:25,800
This is very important. They are like
like... fur man.

452
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:31,400
uncleaned. Those teens across the lake

453
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,800
they are ... the undead..

454
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:38,350
They are vampires.

455
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,900
He took care of them and care and
gave them to eat.

456
01:20:15,272 --> 01:20:19,822
Hearing Impaired by: "Zacxbauer"

457
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,250
And anointed them with the juices of the unpretentious,

458
00:47:56,150 --> 00:47:58,800
With sinking foil and a wolfbaine.

459
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:01,700
anointed them against the evil.

460
00:48:01,850 --> 00:48:03,950
Turn your head.
- Thank you..

461
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:10,050
That's right. There we go.

462
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,750
We make sure that you are nice and safe.

463
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:19,050
someday you will wearing ... nylon.

464
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,950
Where is he?
- What are you doing with my mom Ouija board?

465
00:48:57,150 --> 00:49:00,650
Have you ever seen one of these?
- What would you do with that?

466
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:07,100
Innovation has made the detective
story and Charlie Chan entertaining.

467
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:11,800
Bobby LaGrange ...
is an innovative detective.

468
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,000
after you, sir.

469
00:49:18,550 --> 00:49:21,750
That. Ouija board.

470
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:25,200
we are very close proximity.

471
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,700
to the disease.

472
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:34,750
and the killer probably still
in this area.

473
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,700
maybe we shouldn't doing this
in the morgue.

474
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:43,550
dim the old lights..

475
00:49:58,650 --> 00:50:00,850
Hello.

476
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:06,100
do we know you?
- Yes, it is.

477
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:08,850
you doing that, I can feel it.

478
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,200
No I'm not
- shut up!

479
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,650
H.. I.. M.

480
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:18,300
Him.

481
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:21,850
it wants you

482
00:50:35,650 --> 00:50:37,850
Okay, do we know you?

483
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:41,900
I...

484
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:46,000
am ... her.

485
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:50,800
I am.

486
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:57,700
Arbus, what was that?

487
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:06,800
Pastor, let go watch.

488
00:51:06,950 --> 00:51:09,150
who kill you?

489
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:13,800
B...

490
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:22,550
Sheriff, you doing that. I can feel it.
- do not.

491
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:31,750
who kill you?

492
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:34,400
B...

493
00:51:40,750 --> 00:51:45,100
young people ...
They are evil.

494
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:49,700
and that flamingo kid, he is the one
that has infected them.

495
00:51:49,850 --> 00:51:53,500
he is a vampire. Is he?

496
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:55,850
'Yes'.

497
00:52:53,450 --> 00:52:55,850
Come on, Arbus. Keep your gun hidden.

498
00:53:10,550 --> 00:53:13,950
you must be thirsty?
- exactly

499
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:17,050
I'm looking for Flamingo.
- He is right back here.

500
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:20,150
when the sky low and heavy,
weighing as a lid ...

501
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:25,750
on the groaning spirit, falling
prey to long boredom...

502
00:53:29,750 --> 00:53:32,650
Educated.. you know BAUDELAIRE.

503
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:37,100
I know life man. And I know the
dreams of BAUDELAIRE.

504
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:41,900
and he from the horizon, the entire
circle embracing...

505
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:46,950
a dark day for our pour, even sadder
than the nights.

506
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:53,750
I hoped you will help me to find
the missing girl ...

507
00:53:53,785 --> 00:53:56,200
She is 12 or 13 years.

508
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:02,700
There are a lot of girls there.

509
00:54:07,450 --> 00:54:11,150
you know. People say what going on here
...evil

510
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:14,100
are you worried about that?

511
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:17,950
Look around you. This is what evil to you?

512
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:24,400
look at that moon.

513
00:54:26,650 --> 00:54:28,750
It is beautiful.

514
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:31,100
I have been worried ...

515
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:33,850
it has been 3 days since we have seen it..

516
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:38,550
This is a little kid which i take care but
I am worried that something happened to her.

517
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:48,950
Arbus. Damn it.

518
00:55:05,050 --> 00:55:09,250
You?
You out off uniform?

519
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:13,250
You are here for unofficial business.
What the hell you doing here?

520
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:18,050
he said you okay with it.
He gave me 20 bucks.

521
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:22,800
Mr. collaborator.

522
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:28,050
I thought that we were a team,
all the way through these investigation.

523
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,800
Bobby LaGrange does not like
to be tricked.

524
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:35,213
nor that he's like made to be pull off

525
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:42,900
the famous Flamingo
..my..my..my

526
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:47,100
the lady killer

527
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,400
Arbus, arrest this murderer.

528
00:55:57,100 --> 00:56:00,450
he's like that...He can coming or go.

529
00:56:00,850 --> 00:56:03,050
or he would be gone.

530
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,050
those are the real keys ...
- Yes they are ....

531
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:14,200
this is the official keys.
- That's amazing.

532
00:56:14,350 --> 00:56:17,050
of the clock tower?
- Yes, really?

533
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:19,450
give me that. Where are you going?

534
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:22,214
Come on, I just want to see.
- You don't want to go up there.

535
00:56:55,950 --> 00:56:58,350
That's odd, I was up here yesterday ...

536
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:02,450
and I had no problem with the lock.
- Yesterday?

537
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:04,800
perhaps it was last week.

538
00:57:06,750 --> 00:57:09,350
It worked?
- Last it worked.

539
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:11,900
Let me try.

540
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:16,000
here.
- Thank you.

541
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:34,400
What the hell with that?

542
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:41,050
you tell me you got the butt, have you
ever seen this like that when you're here?

543
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:45,250
I'm not go up there. This place is haunted.
Did you know that?

544
00:57:45,450 --> 00:57:47,450
What is that smell?
- The devil.

545
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,650
The devil is up there.

546
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,800
You will get all over yourself.
I going out.

547
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:55,700
goodbye.

548
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:31,250
come with us daddy...
come with us daddy

549
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:34,550
Help me, daddy...
Come with us daddy.

550
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:36,750
Help me...
Help me...daddy

551
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:14,500
listen,
- What is that?

552
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,200
are they evil?

553
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:00,300
No.

554
01:00:01,250 --> 01:00:03,450
No.

555
01:00:04,050 --> 01:00:08,900
tell me who killed her?
...tell me.

556
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:12,150
You say that you want to know..
but do you?

557
01:00:12,350 --> 01:00:14,800
I want to know the truth.
- There are consequences.

558
01:00:15,650 --> 01:00:17,850
What choice do I have?

559
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:23,550
tell me all of the story.
- As you wish, my friend.

560
01:00:24,250 --> 01:00:28,400
that happen events just make
you shame to remember.

561
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,300
please.
- Thank you, it a sharp of knife.

562
01:00:37,450 --> 01:00:39,500
I would like to add a secret ingredient.

563
01:00:39,650 --> 01:00:42,750
we goanna have special lemonade
for everybody.

564
01:00:45,150 --> 01:00:48,750
that's right...good job.

565
01:00:48,950 --> 01:00:51,150
This sap stinks.
- Careful.

566
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:54,700
you cut your finger.

567
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,300
Please, Alice.
-thank you.

568
01:01:04,550 --> 01:01:06,750
you're welcome
here you go

569
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:17,350
- Do not drink the lemonade,
he put something on it.

570
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:20,750
No, stop.
- No I would like to lemonade, Virginia

571
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:25,050
Virginia, fine. Enough,
..stand still.

572
01:01:25,550 --> 01:01:28,050
Virginia, is being very...
very stupid to do it.

573
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:31,100
we are all going to have some lemonade
it's delicious and sweet...taste it

574
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:44,000
stay...stay...stay here.
- What are you doing?

575
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:47,750
and, then he make a freak full decision.

576
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:52,700
rather than have the children
souls be damn as vampire

577
01:01:53,250 --> 01:01:56,667
he drug the lemonade, and cut
their throats.

578
01:02:06,750 --> 01:02:11,850
Can you make him stop?
Do something..

579
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:23,800
dead of beauty.

580
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:32,750
one child try to save her soul.

581
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:37,000
Virginia?

582
01:02:39,750 --> 01:02:41,950
you play our favorite game?

583
01:02:43,550 --> 01:02:45,750
I will find you.

584
01:02:55,650 --> 01:02:57,850
got you.

585
01:03:05,950 --> 01:03:08,150
Virginia.

586
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:28,950
Virginia.

587
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:41,150
one path to God.

588
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:45,450
one, one way to God.

589
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:26,800
I got you.

590
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:32,100
once he caught her and put chain
had its fascination.

591
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:39,000
No.

592
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:46,100
you must stop screaming.

593
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:49,400
I told you...God want you to meet mom.

594
01:05:55,550 --> 01:05:57,950
that's right. scream all what you want,

595
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,200
Even God can't hear you now.

596
01:06:39,150 --> 01:06:43,350
One road, one way to God..

597
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,850
One road, one way to God...

598
01:06:54,350 --> 01:06:56,800
Only through this way ...

599
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:20,650
during the bright days of its eye-catching
beauty...I took a great deal from her..

600
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,600
not as the living and breathing Virginia ...

601
01:07:23,750 --> 01:07:25,950
but it's the Virginia of the dream.

602
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:39,400
you see ...

603
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:42,100
dear friend ...

604
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:45,950
she was my young cousin ...

605
01:07:48,450 --> 01:07:50,650
my beloved wife.

606
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:54,400
her name was Virginia.

607
01:07:55,050 --> 01:07:57,250
but I gave her many names.

608
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:00,000
Lenor

609
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:02,800
Bernice.

610
01:08:04,100 --> 01:08:07,950
The lady Gaia.
Madenasha.

611
01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:10,150
Annabelle Lee.

612
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:12,500
Alianora.

613
01:09:02,450 --> 01:09:06,150
you know certainly that I am your
partner?...Open the door, wake up.

614
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:09,600
wake up.

615
01:09:11,350 --> 01:09:14,000
open the door, Hall.
- alright..I  hear.

616
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:19,700
Wait until you get to see this.
- What?

617
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:24,350
I have subscribe the 'Writers Weekly'.

618
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:26,500
and this just in

619
01:09:26,650 --> 01:09:31,500
That he said that you took  10,000 dollars
as an advance was for a project call 'Vampire Executions'

620
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:35,350
No, no no.. that was money for some old write.

621
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:38,250
and that money already went to my wife.
that is a mistake.

622
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:43,450
but I was thinking, I do like
'Vampire Executions'...

623
01:09:43,485 --> 01:09:46,450
by Hall Baltimore and Bobby LaGrange.

624
01:09:47,050 --> 01:09:49,300
give me my $5,000 dollar now.

625
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:52,450
there's no goanna be money exchange until
we get the story right.

626
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:55,012
we got to right to the end.
- The end?

627
01:09:55,350 --> 01:09:58,166
The end is who gun it. Like every other
murder mysteries.

628
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:01,100
Let me wake up.
- It's come to who did it

629
01:10:01,250 --> 01:10:03,300
Okay.

630
01:10:03,450 --> 01:10:06,600
You forget your greatest asset.
- yeah..what's  that?

631
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:09,150
Bobby LaGrange is the detective..

632
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:13,000
You got to take Bobby LaGrange use much more
throughout in the entire story ...

633
01:10:13,150 --> 01:10:15,800
because he can solve the crimes himself..

634
01:10:15,950 --> 01:10:18,650
clearly he's work of a serial killer.

635
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:22,650
someone want to silence the girls,
on the other side of the lake.

636
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:25,750
because, they fried a sick mind.

637
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:31,400
And then they sizzling because some psyco
hocus pocus condition...

01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:35,150
the condemn them the evil slaughter they are

639
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:38,250
And that is what in their sick mind.

640
01:10:40,700 --> 01:10:44,950

you think they're evil slut?

641
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:47,200

- The young girl.

642
01:10:47,350 --> 01:10:51,550

643
01:10:51,585 --> 01:10:54,500
every one of them should dead...
and sexs.

644
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:58,600

645
01:11:01,850 --> 01:11:05,300
oh no you don't...

646
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:07,700
No, not Bobby LaGrange...

01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:11,300
Those devil worshiping whore be heard
on the other side of the world.

648
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:19,950
Shit Yes, they are all in dark thing
every one of them. They worship dead and sex.

649
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:23,500
they were just too brutal for
their own good.

650
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:28,550
you know, they have a white flash
with the devil inside them.

651
01:11:34,250 --> 01:11:37,350
little spicy cannot stop,
thinking about.

652
01:11:39,950 --> 01:11:42,000
that not me.
- It's not me.

653
01:11:42,150 --> 01:11:44,200
It's them.
- They are the.

654
01:11:44,350 --> 01:11:46,350
flash of the devil.

655
01:11:48,450 --> 01:11:50,550
I saved their souls

656
01:11:52,050 --> 01:11:54,100
You...

657
01:11:54,250 --> 01:11:56,250
you don't touch me.

658
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:59,000
do not touch me. tearing out the from me.

659
01:11:59,150 --> 01:12:01,850
Priest.
- If you will excuse me ...

660
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:05,650
forgive me for seeking
pleasure outside the company ...

661
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:11,050
cast me another way for the
lighting of my spirit.

662
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:15,400
perhaps, it is the dirt of the boy,
only here alone?

663
01:12:15,700 --> 01:12:18,800
with all of these things together,
thrown ...

664
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:31,000
will burn it ...
- Flame-proof, bullet-proof.

665
01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:04,950
I can't ever look at the Clift,
I am trembling.

666
01:13:07,050 --> 01:13:09,250
This little cliff?

667
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,200
Wait.

668
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:29,300
do you dare to go further?
- Where you're talking about, tell me the ending

669
01:13:29,450 --> 01:13:31,500
If you don't stop now, every word ..

670
01:13:31,650 --> 01:13:34,870
what you write with you pen will be your
your own tale.

671
01:13:35,750 --> 01:13:39,550
You.
You're the ending you seek.

672
01:13:40,650 --> 01:13:43,550
How can you stop now when it's
close to the end?

673
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:46,800
then it's a time to face the truth.

674
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,650
to end this story, there is no other way.

675
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:20,300
I am so ashamed, I should cry
That is my little girl.

676
01:14:20,950 --> 01:14:24,650
That is my daughter. She wanted me
to go with her friends.

677
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:27,050
I thought that there were
little boat....

678
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:30,400
I thought there were children boat
I did not know there were speedboats.

679
01:14:34,250 --> 01:14:38,250
I could guide them. I was
too drunk to wake up.

680
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:43,600
I was with a woman.

681
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:47,800
I am so ashamed.

682
01:14:50,250 --> 01:14:52,900
I could go there,
set the clock

683
01:14:53,250 --> 01:14:56,350
but the wrong time So the alarm
went off.

684
01:15:01,650 --> 01:15:03,850
I could been there ...but

685
01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:08,900
maybe they are still...

686
01:15:11,450 --> 01:15:13,650
so ashamed.

687
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:16,450
so ashamed.

688
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:19,350
than perhaps they would have
survived.

689
01:15:22,050 --> 01:15:26,200
I should been there,

690
01:15:28,801 --> 01:15:30,601
that little girl.

691
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:44,250
We share this little ghost,
my friend.

692
01:15:45,650 --> 01:15:51,200
our work must be the grave that we
prepare as a lovely talent.

693
01:17:04,150 --> 01:17:06,350
'Guilty'.

694
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:09,600

699
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:44,650
Hall Baltimore,

700
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:47,800

703
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:58,850
the suicide of Bobby LaGrange was
eventually linked to...

704
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:03,050
three other murders of 'Wooden Stake', killings in addition to the murder of his deputy, Arbus.
