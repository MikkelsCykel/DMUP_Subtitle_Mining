1
00:03:42,092 --> 00:03:43,605
Are you all right?

2
00:03:43,852 --> 00:03:45,046
Forget him. Clear the room!

3
00:03:52,252 --> 00:03:53,241
Clear.

4
00:04:01,612 --> 00:04:02,886
It's empty.

5
00:04:14,092 --> 00:04:16,765
Colonel Travis,
we've secured the building.

6
00:04:17,052 --> 00:04:18,087
But. . . .

7
00:04:18,532 --> 00:04:21,092
Collins took one, sir.
He's dead.

8
00:04:45,052 --> 00:04:47,168
Clear to land. 2-Tango-Sierra.

9
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:49,130
Okay, so we're clear to land.

10
00:04:49,652 --> 00:04:50,687
What else?

11
00:04:50,972 --> 00:04:53,008
Eight-knot crosswind
from the right.

12
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,565
There's the interstate.

13
00:05:00,812 --> 00:05:04,521
Runway 2-6.
And I got 2-6-0 on the D.G.

14
00:05:05,052 --> 00:05:06,371
Undercarriage.

15
00:05:07,132 --> 00:05:08,201
Coming out.

16
00:05:08,452 --> 00:05:09,248
Good.

17
00:05:09,492 --> 00:05:11,847
It's down and locked.

18
00:05:12,572 --> 00:05:13,561
Anything else?

19
00:05:14,252 --> 00:05:16,641
I don't know. What am I forgetting?

20
00:05:16,972 --> 00:05:18,007
Nothing.

21
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:21,491
Just relax and fly the airplane.

22
00:05:41,332 --> 00:05:45,007
FREDERICK FIELD, MARYLAND

23
00:05:45,292 --> 00:05:48,329
Very nice touchdown, David.
Very smooth.

24
00:05:48,772 --> 00:05:49,966
You've got this wired.

25
00:05:50,212 --> 00:05:51,804
I don't know about that.

26
00:05:52,972 --> 00:05:56,362
Stop here a second.
You are more than ready.

27
00:05:56,612 --> 00:05:59,126
It's time to cut the umbilical cord.

28
00:05:59,372 --> 00:06:01,363
-You sure about this?
-Come on.

29
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:03,091
I wouldn't let you go if I wasn't.

30
00:06:03,692 --> 00:06:06,206
Quick, or I'll change my mind.

31
00:06:06,452 --> 00:06:08,568
Solo time. Just remember:

32
00:06:09,292 --> 00:06:11,123
Keep it simple. Stick and rudder.

33
00:06:12,012 --> 00:06:13,411
Relax and fly the plane.

34
00:06:18,932 --> 00:06:20,251
Take it easy.

35
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:25,600
God, why am I doing this?

36
00:06:38,372 --> 00:06:39,600
Phone!

37
00:06:40,812 --> 00:06:41,847
It's happened!

38
00:07:26,972 --> 00:07:28,610
According to informed sources...

39
00:07:28,852 --> 00:07:32,162
...El-Sayed Jaffa, perhaps the most
feared terrorist in the world...

40
00:07:32,412 --> 00:07:34,243
... was abducted yesterday...

41
00:07:34,852 --> 00:07:37,844
... while secretly attending
his daughter's wedding.

42
00:07:38,172 --> 00:07:40,049
He was handed over
to U. S. authorities...

43
00:07:40,292 --> 00:07:43,841
...arrested, and taken to a warship
in the Mediterranean.

44
00:07:44,092 --> 00:07:45,810
Wire service intel reports.

45
00:07:46,652 --> 00:07:49,928
None of the casualities answer
our description of Hassan.

46
00:07:50,172 --> 00:07:51,730
No indication
he was even there.

47
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:53,200
He was there.

48
00:07:53,452 --> 00:07:55,727
You called this one right.

49
00:07:55,972 --> 00:07:59,442
Half the Middle East is backing Cyprus,
if only in principle.

50
00:08:01,652 --> 00:08:04,689
We wanted him and now we got him.

51
00:08:09,292 --> 00:08:11,760
And all the baggage that goes with him.

52
00:08:12,252 --> 00:08:16,131
Until this is resolved,
Jaffa will remain in U. S. custody...

53
00:08:16,372 --> 00:08:20,331
...an inglorious end to 15 years
of world terrorism.

54
00:08:36,732 --> 00:08:40,407
Oceanic Flight 343, Athens
to Washington...

55
00:08:40,652 --> 00:08:42,370
...now boarding at gate 13.

56
00:08:47,212 --> 00:08:48,201
Welcome aboard.

57
00:08:51,652 --> 00:08:53,483
Third seat on the right.

58
00:08:56,012 --> 00:08:57,240
Is that who I think it is?

59
00:08:57,492 --> 00:08:58,925
In the flesh.

60
00:08:59,932 --> 00:09:03,527
Roger, Athens, cleared as filed.
2-8-0 after takeoff.

61
00:09:08,892 --> 00:09:11,087
Would you like some champagne?

62
00:09:15,092 --> 00:09:16,764
Here, let me help you.

63
00:09:17,012 --> 00:09:18,240
There you go.

64
00:09:21,732 --> 00:09:23,006
Stupid woman.

65
00:09:23,252 --> 00:09:24,321
I'm sorry.

66
00:09:24,972 --> 00:09:27,202
I didn't do it on purpose.

67
00:09:29,372 --> 00:09:33,445
Have a pleasant flight.
Thank you for choosing Oceanic.

68
00:09:33,932 --> 00:09:36,492
Flight attendants,
signal for departure.

69
00:09:36,732 --> 00:09:38,768
Cabin crew, doors to automatic.

70
00:09:38,972 --> 00:09:40,166
Here we go.

71
00:09:53,932 --> 00:09:55,809
Excuse me, sir. May I help you?

72
00:09:56,052 --> 00:09:56,962
Sir?

73
00:09:57,572 --> 00:09:58,721
Excuse me, sir.

74
00:10:03,892 --> 00:10:05,166
Excuse me, sir.

75
00:10:06,132 --> 00:10:07,360
May I help you?

76
00:10:14,612 --> 00:10:17,331
Listen to the sound of AI Tha'r!

77
00:10:32,012 --> 00:10:34,048
This is your captain.

78
00:10:34,292 --> 00:10:35,930
You may remove your seat belts.

79
00:10:36,172 --> 00:10:38,163
Feel free to move about the cabin.

80
00:10:38,532 --> 00:10:41,763
However, when you're seated,
do what we do:

81
00:10:42,012 --> 00:10:43,923
Leave your seats belt on.

82
00:10:44,932 --> 00:10:47,002
I see you've got the usual load.

83
00:10:47,252 --> 00:10:48,401
Who is it this time?

84
00:10:48,652 --> 00:10:51,883
It's my brother's twins.
It's their birthday next week.

85
00:10:54,012 --> 00:10:56,287
Have a pleasant flight. Thank you.

86
00:11:06,292 --> 00:11:07,247
And. . . .

87
00:11:07,612 --> 00:11:08,442
Me?

88
00:11:08,892 --> 00:11:10,564
Go on. Open it.

89
00:11:13,532 --> 00:11:15,250
Oh, Jeannie.

90
00:11:16,932 --> 00:11:18,365
It's for the ring.

91
00:11:25,412 --> 00:11:27,368
I'm going in the pit. See you.

92
00:11:27,612 --> 00:11:28,727
All right.

93
00:12:49,732 --> 00:12:50,642
What was that?!

94
00:12:56,052 --> 00:12:57,451
Maintain your course.

95
00:12:59,652 --> 00:13:01,688
Reduce your airspeed
as indicated.

96
00:13:01,932 --> 00:13:02,728
Careful.

97
00:13:03,612 --> 00:13:04,567
I am a pilot.

98
00:13:12,332 --> 00:13:13,162
American Embassy.

99
00:13:13,412 --> 00:13:15,164
You've witnessed AI Tha 'r's conviction.

100
00:13:15,892 --> 00:13:17,962
I have a message for the President.

101
00:13:18,212 --> 00:13:19,930
I'm in control of flight 343.

102
00:13:23,532 --> 00:13:24,567
Sit down!

103
00:13:31,092 --> 00:13:32,923
Sit down! Sit! Sit!

104
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:35,091
Sit down! Nobody moves!

105
00:13:35,332 --> 00:13:36,685
Nobody!

106
00:13:38,772 --> 00:13:40,171
Quiet! Quiet!

107
00:13:40,412 --> 00:13:42,209
Sit down!

108
00:13:53,652 --> 00:13:54,607
Get up!

109
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:56,207
Take her.

110
00:13:58,452 --> 00:13:59,328
Calm down!

111
00:13:59,812 --> 00:14:00,927
It's over!

112
00:14:01,612 --> 00:14:03,091
All right, it's over.

113
00:14:14,652 --> 00:14:16,131
Excuse me, gentlemen.

114
00:14:21,732 --> 00:14:23,927
You look like you could use this.

115
00:14:24,292 --> 00:14:25,202
David Grant.

116
00:14:25,452 --> 00:14:26,248
Michelle Thomas.

117
00:14:26,492 --> 00:14:27,925
-You like hockey?
-Love it.

118
00:14:28,172 --> 00:14:29,571
I've got two tickets--

119
00:14:29,812 --> 00:14:32,849
Are you Dr. Grant?
You have an urgent phone call.

120
00:14:34,292 --> 00:14:35,884
I'll be right back.

121
00:14:37,012 --> 00:14:37,967
Come on!

122
00:14:38,292 --> 00:14:40,886
Sit down! Sit! Sit!

123
00:14:54,052 --> 00:14:56,646
Attention, everyone on board.

124
00:14:57,612 --> 00:14:58,761
Listen carefully.

125
00:14:59,252 --> 00:15:02,050
Remain in your seats
with your belts fastened.

126
00:15:03,132 --> 00:15:04,247
Do as you're told. . .

127
00:15:05,172 --> 00:15:08,164
. . .and there will be no need
for further violence.

128
00:15:23,412 --> 00:15:25,243
Where's the passenger manifest?

129
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:27,764
Where's the passenger manifest?

130
00:15:28,772 --> 00:15:29,602
I destroyed it.

131
00:15:31,172 --> 00:15:32,651
You destroyed it?

132
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:49,641
To protect passengers?

133
00:15:51,212 --> 00:15:52,361
Or someone else?

134
00:15:59,012 --> 00:16:01,685
That was a very brave thing to do. . .

135
00:16:02,572 --> 00:16:04,927
. . .and totally unnecessary.

136
00:16:15,412 --> 00:16:18,165
Here's the data.
Sorry to spoil your evening.

137
00:16:18,412 --> 00:16:19,765
That makes two of us.

138
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:20,967
It's him, no doubt.

139
00:16:21,252 --> 00:16:23,527
One's a recording.
The one from the plane is live.

140
00:16:28,292 --> 00:16:29,486
This doesn't make sense.

141
00:16:29,892 --> 00:16:31,848
What the hell is he up to?

142
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:33,361
General Wood called.

143
00:16:33,612 --> 00:16:36,729
Briefing at 6:00 in the Situation Room.

144
00:16:36,972 --> 00:16:39,008
-Pentagon?
-Welcome to the big leagues.

145
00:16:39,252 --> 00:16:42,050
White's running the show
in the President's absence.

146
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:44,044
-Got anything I can wear?
-T-shirt.

147
00:16:44,292 --> 00:16:46,203
A jog bra and a pair of running shorts.

148
00:16:46,412 --> 00:16:47,208
Thanks anyway.

149
00:16:48,172 --> 00:16:49,366
Keep at it, guys.

150
00:16:49,612 --> 00:16:50,965
This is a think tank.

151
00:16:51,252 --> 00:16:52,651
They pay us to think.

152
00:16:52,892 --> 00:16:53,881
By the way. . .

153
00:16:54,372 --> 00:16:56,010
. . .who heads the anti-terrorist unit?

154
00:16:57,012 --> 00:16:58,206
Colonel Austin Travis.

155
00:16:58,652 --> 00:17:00,085
Special Forces Command.

156
00:17:00,412 --> 00:17:01,208
You know him?

157
00:17:21,012 --> 00:17:22,081
Jesus!

158
00:17:25,092 --> 00:17:27,686
They said it was "come-as-you-are. "

159
00:17:33,092 --> 00:17:34,684
-Excuse me.
-David Grant.

160
00:17:36,572 --> 00:17:38,244
This was recorded from the plane...

161
00:17:38,492 --> 00:17:40,562
. . .shortly after the bombing.

162
00:17:41,972 --> 00:17:44,805
This is AI Tha 'r.
I have a message for the President.

163
00:17:45,412 --> 00:17:47,972
The London bombing
indicates my resolve.

164
00:17:48,932 --> 00:17:50,923
I am in control of Flight 343.

165
00:17:51,132 --> 00:17:54,169
Its passengers
shall remain in my custody...

166
00:17:54,412 --> 00:17:56,687
...until Abu Jaffa...

167
00:17:56,932 --> 00:17:58,923
...is released from captivity.

168
00:17:59,132 --> 00:18:01,487
Follow my instructions precisely.

169
00:18:01,732 --> 00:18:04,200
No theater. No negotiation.

170
00:18:04,572 --> 00:18:07,484
Jaffa will be taken
to Gatwick Airport...

171
00:18:07,732 --> 00:18:11,520
... where a jet will land,
then leave with him.

172
00:18:11,772 --> 00:18:15,082
On his release,
Flight 343 will go to Washington...

173
00:18:15,332 --> 00:18:17,687
... where half the passengers
will be exchanged for fuel...

174
00:18:17,932 --> 00:18:20,002
...and 50 million in gold bullion.

175
00:18:20,252 --> 00:18:24,564
Jaffa must be in communication
with me by 6 a.m...

176
00:18:24,852 --> 00:18:27,810
...or London will suffer
another punishment...

177
00:18:28,012 --> 00:18:31,641
... that will make today's bombing
pale in comparison.

178
00:18:31,892 --> 00:18:32,847
Mr. Grant.

179
00:18:34,132 --> 00:18:35,042
This man. . .

180
00:18:35,892 --> 00:18:37,848
. . .AI Tha'r, who is he?

181
00:18:38,892 --> 00:18:41,326
Voice analysis confirms
it's Nagi Hassan. . .

182
00:18:41,772 --> 00:18:42,921
. . .Jaffa's deputy director.

183
00:18:43,172 --> 00:18:47,051
He's an extremist.
Take him at his word. He's not bluffing.

184
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,691
Thank you.

185
00:18:49,332 --> 00:18:51,004
Any other comments?

186
00:18:51,332 --> 00:18:54,244
It seems our posture must
be of containment.

187
00:18:55,412 --> 00:18:57,528
Acquiesce to Nagi's demands?

188
00:18:57,772 --> 00:18:59,683
I don't see any other choice.

189
00:18:59,932 --> 00:19:01,923
London is demanding action.

190
00:19:03,172 --> 00:19:04,400
I agree.

191
00:19:04,652 --> 00:19:07,371
I hate the idea of conceding
to that bastard.

192
00:19:07,612 --> 00:19:10,206
But if we get him on the ground,
we'll have options.

193
00:19:10,452 --> 00:19:13,489
Travis' team will respond
once the plane is at Dulles.

194
00:19:13,732 --> 00:19:16,769
It means shutting it down,
re-routing all traffic.

195
00:19:17,012 --> 00:19:19,845
A full military control of the area.

196
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:24,447
Secretary White. . . .

197
00:19:24,692 --> 00:19:26,410
Excuse me, gentlemen. . .

198
00:19:26,652 --> 00:19:29,291
. . .I don't think we can allow
that plane to land. . .

199
00:19:29,532 --> 00:19:31,488
. . .or even enter U.S. airspace.

200
00:19:31,892 --> 00:19:32,927
What do you mean?

201
00:19:33,252 --> 00:19:35,891
I don't think this is about hostages.

202
00:19:36,132 --> 00:19:39,807
It's about one man planning
a major strike against the U.S.

203
00:19:42,212 --> 00:19:44,168
You'd better explain yourself.

204
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:48,408
Our research leads me to believe. . .

205
00:19:48,652 --> 00:19:52,770
. . .that due to his internal
political situation, Nagi Hassan. . .

206
00:19:53,012 --> 00:19:54,650
. . .planned Jaffa's abduction.

207
00:19:55,572 --> 00:19:56,891
Go on.

208
00:19:57,092 --> 00:20:00,482
Six months ago,
a shipment of DZ-5 was hijacked. . .

209
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:02,131
. . .in transit to Germany.

210
00:20:02,372 --> 00:20:04,966
We're certain
the Chechen Mafia was behind it.

211
00:20:05,172 --> 00:20:08,403
But recent attempts to recover
the gas have failed.

212
00:20:10,812 --> 00:20:13,121
Rumors surfaced that the DZ-5. . .

213
00:20:13,372 --> 00:20:14,964
. . .was in the hands of Asmed Rhasjami.

214
00:20:15,332 --> 00:20:18,165
This is the prick
who sent us on a wild goose chase.

215
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:22,488
. . .a supplier of arms and
explosives to Jaffa's group.

216
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:25,325
Mr. Grant. . .

217
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:30,129
. . .are you saying the nerve gas
is on board?

218
00:20:30,732 --> 00:20:31,960
Yes, sir, I am.

219
00:20:32,212 --> 00:20:36,524
In my opinion, Hassan plans to
use the DZ-5 and the plane as a weapon.

220
00:20:36,772 --> 00:20:39,161
A sort of poor man's atomic bomb. . .

221
00:20:39,412 --> 00:20:42,165
. . .to be detonated here,
over Washington.

222
00:20:42,972 --> 00:20:45,440
How much DZ-5 might he have?

223
00:20:45,972 --> 00:20:48,122
I can't be exact, sir.

224
00:20:48,452 --> 00:20:50,204
But I can tell you this:

225
00:20:51,092 --> 00:20:52,445
If this were DZ-5. . .

226
00:20:57,012 --> 00:21:00,322
. . .that drop would be more than enough
to kill every man here.

227
00:21:07,092 --> 00:21:09,208
The name he's using, "AI Tha'r" . . .

228
00:21:09,452 --> 00:21:12,205
. . .in ancient Arabic means "revenge. "

229
00:21:20,292 --> 00:21:22,760
Welcome aboard, Senator Mavros.

230
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,841
The press thinks you could be
the next President.

231
00:21:27,692 --> 00:21:30,081
It's an honor to have you with us.

232
00:21:47,892 --> 00:21:50,087
That plane will be here in 8 hours.

233
00:21:51,932 --> 00:21:53,888
The President has two options:

234
00:21:55,612 --> 00:21:57,364
Disregard Mr. Grant's theory. . .

235
00:21:57,612 --> 00:22:00,126
. . .and let the plane proceed
to the U.S.

236
00:22:00,812 --> 00:22:03,280
Or destroy it before it gets here. . .

237
00:22:03,532 --> 00:22:06,092
. . .along with 406 passengers.

238
00:22:08,692 --> 00:22:10,011
Even if we're right. . .

239
00:22:10,772 --> 00:22:12,842
. . .how would we ever prove it?

240
00:22:19,012 --> 00:22:22,084
Colonel, if you have an opinion,
let's hear it.

241
00:22:22,332 --> 00:22:24,721
There is another possibility.

242
00:22:25,172 --> 00:22:27,128
It's a Hail Mary pass, but. . . .

243
00:22:27,372 --> 00:22:29,169
Colonel, tell him what you need.

244
00:22:29,412 --> 00:22:33,007
There's a man named Dennis Cahill
who's an engineer for ARPA.

245
00:22:33,252 --> 00:22:35,720
If we could get him on the line ASAP. . .

246
00:22:36,652 --> 00:22:38,961
. . .he can tell you what I have in mind.

247
00:22:42,372 --> 00:22:44,886
Remora was developed
for the space program...

248
00:22:45,132 --> 00:22:47,692
...for low-orbit linkups
with the shuttle.

249
00:22:47,932 --> 00:22:51,641
It has since been
modified by the Air Force...

250
00:22:51,892 --> 00:22:55,567
... to study transferring
bomber crews at altitude...

251
00:22:55,812 --> 00:22:57,643
...as well as other...

252
00:22:57,892 --> 00:22:58,881
. . .contingencies.

253
00:22:59,132 --> 00:23:02,169
We've had six hookups,
all successful.

254
00:23:02,412 --> 00:23:04,562
This is a civilian airliner.

255
00:23:05,532 --> 00:23:06,362
Mr. Cahill. . .

256
00:23:07,092 --> 00:23:11,210
...do you mean Remora could work
with a 747?

257
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:15,971
This application was never
intended for a civilian airliner.

258
00:23:16,692 --> 00:23:19,365
However, smooth-surface mating tests...

259
00:23:19,612 --> 00:23:21,887
... were successful in a wind tunnel.

260
00:23:22,132 --> 00:23:23,247
A wind tunnel.

261
00:23:24,892 --> 00:23:28,043
I know you wrote the book on
assaulting hijacked aircraft.

262
00:23:28,292 --> 00:23:30,123
But this is 5 miles above Earth.

263
00:23:31,612 --> 00:23:35,048
Under the circumstances,
we don't have any other options.

264
00:23:36,372 --> 00:23:37,521
It's your call.

265
00:23:38,132 --> 00:23:42,011
We must be airborne in an hour,
six men. I'll need Mr. Cahill. . .

266
00:23:42,252 --> 00:23:43,765
... to supervise the linkup.

267
00:23:45,932 --> 00:23:46,808
Mr. Cahill...

268
00:23:47,052 --> 00:23:49,566
... you and the Remora
be ready in an hour.

269
00:23:51,812 --> 00:23:55,407
The press is in a feeding
frenzy about the hijacking.

270
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:58,565
Especially with Senator Mavros
on board.

271
00:23:58,932 --> 00:24:02,368
Not a word of this operation
is to go beyond this room.

272
00:24:03,972 --> 00:24:05,371
Anything you need, name it.

273
00:24:06,292 --> 00:24:10,046
We'll need all the on-site intel
we can get.

274
00:24:10,292 --> 00:24:14,126
I think Mr. Grant could
provide us with a great advantage.

275
00:24:15,092 --> 00:24:18,368
And I'd just love to
have him come along.

276
00:24:21,172 --> 00:24:22,764
You ready to take a plane ride. . .

277
00:24:22,972 --> 00:24:25,691
. . .in the interest of national security?

278
00:24:27,892 --> 00:24:29,086
Of course.

279
00:25:06,692 --> 00:25:08,648
Check it out. It's the colonel.

280
00:25:20,772 --> 00:25:22,649
Didn't have details on the op. . .

281
00:25:22,892 --> 00:25:25,008
. . .so we brought everything,
even condoms!

282
00:25:27,172 --> 00:25:29,128
Who's this? 007?

283
00:25:29,972 --> 00:25:32,406
That's Mr. Grant, with lntelligence.

284
00:25:32,612 --> 00:25:34,250
He'll travel with us partway.

285
00:25:34,492 --> 00:25:35,607
Partway?

286
00:25:35,812 --> 00:25:37,564
I'll explain on the bird.
Let's go!

287
00:26:06,812 --> 00:26:08,564
So where's the 1 30?

288
00:26:09,012 --> 00:26:10,684
Sergeant Baker. . .

289
00:26:11,252 --> 00:26:13,163
. . .I reckon that's it.

290
00:26:37,732 --> 00:26:39,848
You're joking, right?

291
00:26:40,052 --> 00:26:42,282
Too much gear.
We won't get off the ground.

292
00:26:42,772 --> 00:26:45,127
Break it down, boys.
Close-quarter weapons. . .

293
00:26:45,372 --> 00:26:47,840
. . .com units, ordinance,
sleep agent. Dump the rest.

294
00:26:56,092 --> 00:27:00,768
Andrews ground, Remora,
hangar three, taxi for takeoff.

295
00:27:51,892 --> 00:27:53,325
It's all hooked up.

296
00:27:59,612 --> 00:28:01,284
Oh, God.

297
00:28:01,532 --> 00:28:03,648
Allison's been gone a long time.

298
00:28:03,892 --> 00:28:07,726
They wouldn't leave her
there alone. Something's wrong.

299
00:28:22,692 --> 00:28:24,444
Let's go through this.

300
00:28:25,052 --> 00:28:28,601
Baker, set up the com link
with the plane and the Pentagon.

301
00:28:28,852 --> 00:28:31,241
-Grant monitors.
-But I stay here?

302
00:28:31,692 --> 00:28:32,966
That's correct.

303
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:36,807
The Remora will refuel in flight,
then trail the 747.

304
00:28:37,012 --> 00:28:39,446
You'll be in video and
audio contact with us.

305
00:28:39,692 --> 00:28:43,241
Your assessment
of Nagi's behavior is essential.

306
00:28:43,692 --> 00:28:44,841
I'll do what I can.

307
00:28:45,332 --> 00:28:46,890
Once we find the bad guys. . .

308
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:48,650
. . .we'll look for the DZ-5.

309
00:28:48,892 --> 00:28:51,804
If we find it, you'll tap
into the oxygen supply. . .

310
00:28:52,052 --> 00:28:55,283
. . .with the sleep agent.
Lights out. We take the bird.

311
00:28:55,892 --> 00:28:58,804
Once we've taken control,
we'll divert.

312
00:28:59,052 --> 00:29:01,168
Any problems, any questions?

313
00:29:01,892 --> 00:29:03,211
Greenland's our best bet.

314
00:29:03,652 --> 00:29:04,971
If the bomb has a short fuse. . .

315
00:29:05,172 --> 00:29:08,130
. . .then my ass'll rain over Greenland?
I don't think so.

316
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:10,488
That's why I get the big bucks.

317
00:29:10,692 --> 00:29:11,488
For what?

318
00:29:11,732 --> 00:29:13,211
To save your ass.

319
00:29:13,452 --> 00:29:15,170
That's what I want to hear.

320
00:29:56,612 --> 00:29:57,806
The safehouse in Trieste. . .

321
00:29:58,812 --> 00:30:00,325
. . .that was your intel.

322
00:30:00,572 --> 00:30:02,688
The nerve gas was there, Colonel.

323
00:30:03,172 --> 00:30:04,890
Operation was late.

324
00:30:05,812 --> 00:30:07,291
If you say so.

325
00:30:09,412 --> 00:30:11,448
I hope your averages improve.

326
00:30:12,052 --> 00:30:13,883
If you don't believe me. . .

327
00:30:14,292 --> 00:30:15,441
. . .why're you here?

328
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:19,450
Who else will do it?

329
00:30:21,292 --> 00:30:22,281
You?

330
00:30:28,132 --> 00:30:29,201
My men are hungry.

331
00:30:29,972 --> 00:30:31,087
See to it.

332
00:30:31,772 --> 00:30:33,524
The food's in the lower galley.

333
00:30:33,772 --> 00:30:34,966
I must use the elevator.

334
00:30:36,052 --> 00:30:37,007
All right.

335
00:30:37,732 --> 00:30:39,688
What about the passengers?

336
00:30:39,932 --> 00:30:42,446
They need something,
especially the children.

337
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:47,129
They may have beverages
and use the bathrooms.

338
00:30:47,772 --> 00:30:48,921
You're responsible.

339
00:30:49,412 --> 00:30:52,370
Anything suspicious will
bring about repercussions.

340
00:30:52,852 --> 00:30:53,807
Understood?

341
00:30:55,012 --> 00:30:56,127
Yes.

342
00:31:08,212 --> 00:31:09,088
My God!

343
00:31:30,572 --> 00:31:33,530
Satellite tracking indicates
our intercept here.

344
00:31:34,052 --> 00:31:36,850
That'll give you 4 hours
to complete your mission.

345
00:31:37,052 --> 00:31:40,283
Our target is the hatch near
the nose of the plane.

346
00:31:45,052 --> 00:31:48,044
As soon as we lock on,
I'll raise the sleeve.

347
00:31:48,292 --> 00:31:51,568
When it's pressurized,
I'll open the hatch of the 747.

348
00:31:51,812 --> 00:31:54,007
When you're inside, I'll lock it.

349
00:31:54,212 --> 00:31:55,486
Baker must go first.

350
00:31:55,732 --> 00:31:59,520
The alarm on the hatch must be
neutralized. Tell him how.

351
00:31:59,772 --> 00:32:01,683
I can't just do that.

352
00:32:02,372 --> 00:32:04,328
It's not a B-52 with a docking collar.

353
00:32:04,572 --> 00:32:06,005
It's a 747 without one.

354
00:32:06,252 --> 00:32:08,766
Equalization process is delicate.

355
00:32:08,972 --> 00:32:10,724
If the seal's not the proper vacuum. . .

356
00:32:10,972 --> 00:32:13,645
. . .both planes could decompress.
Our mission's over.

357
00:32:18,012 --> 00:32:21,322
This is what we'll do.
Baker follows right behind you.

358
00:32:21,572 --> 00:32:25,690
When the hatch opens, get inside
so Baker can lock off the switch.

359
00:32:25,972 --> 00:32:29,123
As soon as we're on board,
you go reseal the hatch.

360
00:32:29,532 --> 00:32:33,207
I'll clip the circuit from the ladder.
I don't need to go on the plane.

361
00:32:33,852 --> 00:32:35,331
That's how it's going to be.

362
00:32:35,572 --> 00:32:36,641
I'm an engineer--

363
00:32:37,132 --> 00:32:38,326
That's it!

364
00:32:48,972 --> 00:32:49,802
Target sighted.

365
00:33:20,172 --> 00:33:21,571
Initiating approach.

366
00:33:29,052 --> 00:33:31,566
Climbing to flight level 3-8-5.

367
00:33:32,252 --> 00:33:34,288
Activating Doppler imaging system.

368
00:33:38,252 --> 00:33:40,971
Range: 1 ,000 meters and closing.

369
00:33:41,452 --> 00:33:42,407
750.

370
00:33:43,452 --> 00:33:45,010
500.

371
00:33:45,932 --> 00:33:47,570
350.

372
00:33:48,612 --> 00:33:49,965
We have heavy turbulence.

373
00:33:50,932 --> 00:33:53,287
Only eight to ten seconds of this.

374
00:33:55,052 --> 00:33:58,408
We're entering the slipstream.
In a moment it'll settle.

375
00:34:03,692 --> 00:34:04,522
See that path?

376
00:34:05,532 --> 00:34:07,602
That's the sweet spot!

377
00:34:08,012 --> 00:34:10,401
We'll be on it in two seconds!

378
00:34:15,692 --> 00:34:17,648
We're ready, Mr. Cahill.

379
00:34:19,852 --> 00:34:22,002
Primary laser targeting.

380
00:34:24,052 --> 00:34:26,202
Switch to master. And locked.

381
00:34:35,372 --> 00:34:37,761
Switching to dorsal camera system.

382
00:34:44,892 --> 00:34:46,086
Range to target:

383
00:34:46,332 --> 00:34:47,287
Thirty meters.

384
00:34:49,412 --> 00:34:50,686
Target point in sight.

385
00:34:53,772 --> 00:34:55,205
Call the approach.

386
00:34:56,172 --> 00:34:57,366
Steady.

387
00:35:00,492 --> 00:35:01,845
Left 0.5.

388
00:35:05,372 --> 00:35:06,691
Forward one.

389
00:35:07,852 --> 00:35:09,331
Easy.

390
00:35:12,452 --> 00:35:13,441
You're right on it.

391
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:15,008
You're on it.

392
00:35:15,892 --> 00:35:17,723
Hold it right there.

393
00:35:17,932 --> 00:35:18,808
Lock.

394
00:35:19,772 --> 00:35:21,285
Prepare target for linkup.

395
00:35:22,012 --> 00:35:23,604
Extending the sleeve.

396
00:35:26,972 --> 00:35:28,644
-Activate.
-Roger.

397
00:35:45,452 --> 00:35:46,931
Autopilot on.

398
00:35:48,492 --> 00:35:49,561
We're engaged.

399
00:36:09,852 --> 00:36:11,922
Primary tunnel pressurized and stable.

400
00:36:12,172 --> 00:36:13,048
I'm going up.

401
00:36:34,572 --> 00:36:35,641
Do it.

402
00:36:49,292 --> 00:36:50,407
Seal looks good.

403
00:36:52,732 --> 00:36:54,609
We got a stable vacuum.

404
00:36:57,212 --> 00:36:58,850
I'm opening the outer hatch.

405
00:37:22,892 --> 00:37:25,201
-What's that, a short?
-I don't know.

406
00:37:29,132 --> 00:37:30,087
Move it.

407
00:37:31,772 --> 00:37:33,205
Come on.

408
00:37:33,692 --> 00:37:34,522
Move your ass.

409
00:37:46,092 --> 00:37:47,491
Your turn.

410
00:37:56,812 --> 00:37:58,006
A little bumpy.

411
00:38:09,212 --> 00:38:10,122
What's that?

412
00:38:10,652 --> 00:38:12,210
That's a warning light.

413
00:38:12,452 --> 00:38:15,125
It's for an open hatch
in the avionics room.

414
00:38:15,372 --> 00:38:17,727
That's impossible.
The plane is pressurized.

415
00:38:18,052 --> 00:38:19,451
-Where is this room?
-Below.

416
00:38:19,692 --> 00:38:21,842
It's under the first-class cabin.

417
00:38:26,212 --> 00:38:27,565
Rat, you're next.

418
00:38:28,292 --> 00:38:29,930
Doc, the bags.

419
00:38:30,212 --> 00:38:31,930
Hope there's a good movie
on this flight.

420
00:38:36,332 --> 00:38:37,128
Cappy.

421
00:38:42,172 --> 00:38:43,127
Clear. Next.

422
00:38:43,372 --> 00:38:44,168
Come on.

423
00:38:47,932 --> 00:38:49,331
Where's the clip?

424
00:38:49,572 --> 00:38:51,688
-You put it in?
-It was there!

425
00:38:51,932 --> 00:38:53,206
You're on my shit list!

426
00:38:55,212 --> 00:38:57,123
Hold up, we lost the clip.

427
00:39:03,492 --> 00:39:04,561
Let's go! Let's go!

428
00:39:16,252 --> 00:39:17,526
Got it!

429
00:39:19,132 --> 00:39:20,008
Come on!

430
00:39:21,412 --> 00:39:23,448
See, it went out.
It's a short.

431
00:39:24,892 --> 00:39:26,007
Why aren't we climbing?

432
00:39:27,052 --> 00:39:28,963
Come on, old man, move it.

433
00:39:32,852 --> 00:39:33,648
What the hell?!

434
00:39:33,892 --> 00:39:34,768
Wind shear!

435
00:39:48,732 --> 00:39:49,562
Climb!

436
00:39:55,892 --> 00:39:56,847
We are passing 330!

437
00:40:00,732 --> 00:40:02,051
320!

438
00:40:02,292 --> 00:40:03,281
What's going on?!

439
00:40:03,532 --> 00:40:05,170
We have to break off now!

440
00:40:06,452 --> 00:40:07,771
I can't hold the seal!

441
00:40:08,532 --> 00:40:10,602
We got to pull him up.

442
00:40:13,172 --> 00:40:14,048
What're you doing?

443
00:40:14,292 --> 00:40:15,486
Let's move it!

444
00:40:15,892 --> 00:40:17,928
Now! Now! Now!

445
00:40:19,732 --> 00:40:21,324
He's unconscious!

446
00:40:21,572 --> 00:40:22,641
Get above him!

447
00:40:24,132 --> 00:40:25,042
Hold on.

448
00:40:25,572 --> 00:40:26,641
Pull him up!

449
00:40:28,692 --> 00:40:29,522
Get him out!

450
00:40:29,772 --> 00:40:30,682
Move it!

451
00:40:30,932 --> 00:40:32,001
Get above him!

452
00:40:40,692 --> 00:40:43,286
We got him. Now get out of there.
Move.

453
00:40:44,332 --> 00:40:46,402
Why is she so goddamn heavy?

454
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:49,886
Jesus, they're climbing!

455
00:40:50,132 --> 00:40:51,326
I'm climbing with them.

456
00:41:02,532 --> 00:41:03,931
Too much stress on the sleeve!

457
00:41:12,252 --> 00:41:13,765
We're losing pressure.

458
00:41:14,332 --> 00:41:16,448
The seals are going!
Listen to me!

459
00:41:16,692 --> 00:41:20,128
Close the hatch now
or we'll lose both planes!

460
00:41:20,532 --> 00:41:21,521
Come on!

461
00:41:21,772 --> 00:41:23,046
Grab my hand!

462
00:41:24,812 --> 00:41:26,928
I can't hold it! Close the hatch!

463
00:41:27,932 --> 00:41:28,762
Lower the sleeve!

464
00:41:33,692 --> 00:41:37,651
Listen to me! Close the hatch now
or we'll all die!

465
00:41:38,572 --> 00:41:39,971
We're losing pressure!

466
00:41:44,252 --> 00:41:46,049
We're not going to make it!

467
00:41:48,452 --> 00:41:49,407
You are!

468
00:42:13,812 --> 00:42:15,086
She's gone.

469
00:42:18,292 --> 00:42:21,329
Castle Rock, Big Eye Six.
We lost contact with Hail Mary.

470
00:42:22,692 --> 00:42:25,001
Big Eye Six, was delivery accomplished?

471
00:42:25,252 --> 00:42:29,325
Can't say. Hail Mary was attempting
delivery when contact ended.

472
00:42:29,572 --> 00:42:31,324
Did they make it onboard?

473
00:42:31,572 --> 00:42:35,565
If they did, they'll establish
a link with us. Where's the fleet?

474
00:42:35,812 --> 00:42:39,930
The carrier group's heading to
an intercept point in the Atlantic.

475
00:42:40,692 --> 00:42:42,250
Have them go to alert.

476
00:43:26,532 --> 00:43:28,807
I have to check the equipment
in the avionics room.

477
00:43:30,092 --> 00:43:31,571
Show me this room.

478
00:43:41,052 --> 00:43:44,442
There's a depression.
A deformity of C-7.

479
00:43:44,692 --> 00:43:48,970
He's got a fractured vertebrae.
We have to immobilize him.

480
00:43:58,092 --> 00:43:59,923
Can you move over here, please?

481
00:44:00,172 --> 00:44:01,048
-Move!
-Sorry.

482
00:44:02,092 --> 00:44:04,526
Hang on, Cappy, you old dog.

483
00:44:11,052 --> 00:44:13,088
Buddy, you got some morphine here.

484
00:44:13,332 --> 00:44:14,765
That'll help the pain.

485
00:44:24,612 --> 00:44:26,489
Give me a break. You go down there.

486
00:44:26,692 --> 00:44:27,488
Quiet!

487
00:45:25,932 --> 00:45:26,762
Go.

488
00:45:48,532 --> 00:45:50,045
It's a fried circuit.

489
00:45:50,292 --> 00:45:52,408
It's an overload of some kind.

490
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:54,771
It happens.

491
00:46:36,332 --> 00:46:37,651
Close it.

492
00:47:09,532 --> 00:47:10,362
Everything okay?

493
00:47:13,292 --> 00:47:14,725
Just a blown circuit.

494
00:47:15,292 --> 00:47:17,123
Must've been the turbulence.

495
00:47:34,932 --> 00:47:36,411
What'll we do?

496
00:47:42,092 --> 00:47:44,447
Get me the Pentagon on sat-com.

497
00:47:51,372 --> 00:47:52,487
The radio didn't make it.

498
00:47:56,572 --> 00:48:00,201
We have no way to tell them
we're onboard. They'll think we're dead.

499
00:48:00,732 --> 00:48:02,131
Shut up, Cahill.

500
00:48:02,372 --> 00:48:06,126
He's right. As far as they know,
we went down with the plane.

501
00:48:06,372 --> 00:48:09,250
The Pentagon is going to shoot us down.

502
00:48:14,772 --> 00:48:16,410
We were their only option.

503
00:48:20,252 --> 00:48:21,162
Listen to me.

504
00:48:22,852 --> 00:48:23,807
We must negotiate.

505
00:48:24,012 --> 00:48:26,480
Tell Hassan the Pentagon
knows his plan. . .

506
00:48:26,732 --> 00:48:29,371
. . .and he'll never be allowed
to reach U.S. airspace.

507
00:48:29,612 --> 00:48:31,204
-Calm down.
-I'm fine.

508
00:48:31,452 --> 00:48:33,090
I know what I'm talking about.

509
00:48:33,332 --> 00:48:35,129
We have to!
It's our only chance.

510
00:48:35,372 --> 00:48:36,521
They've got to listen.

511
00:48:36,772 --> 00:48:38,091
That won't stop them.

512
00:48:45,292 --> 00:48:46,202
Get your hands off me!

513
00:48:46,452 --> 00:48:47,202
You're not going anywhere!

514
00:48:47,452 --> 00:48:49,886
I didn't sign up for this
G.I. Joe bullshit!

515
00:48:50,092 --> 00:48:53,289
We don't need to do that.
He'll be all right.

516
00:48:54,892 --> 00:48:56,610
Listen to me.

517
00:48:56,852 --> 00:48:59,810
There is no negotiating
with Nagi Hassan. Understand?

518
00:49:00,052 --> 00:49:02,088
If he knew we were here,
he'd kill us.

519
00:49:02,532 --> 00:49:05,126
So let's calm down, everybody.

520
00:49:07,292 --> 00:49:09,442
Just sit down and relax.

521
00:49:12,172 --> 00:49:14,481
With no way to communicate, he's right.

522
00:49:14,732 --> 00:49:16,768
They'll blow us out of the sky.

523
00:49:16,972 --> 00:49:18,803
They don't know we're not onboard.

524
00:49:19,012 --> 00:49:21,606
They'll wait until the last second,
hoping for a break.

525
00:49:21,852 --> 00:49:23,205
We've got some time.

526
00:49:25,372 --> 00:49:28,125
How much time
before we hit U.S. airspace?

527
00:49:29,932 --> 00:49:31,251
Three hours, 50 minutes.

528
00:49:33,532 --> 00:49:34,647
What's left of the gear?

529
00:49:35,132 --> 00:49:36,565
We've lost the sat-com. . .

530
00:49:36,812 --> 00:49:38,962
. . .scanners, sleep agent.

531
00:49:39,212 --> 00:49:42,887
We've got half the weapons, probes,
mikes, bomb kit. That's it.

532
00:49:43,212 --> 00:49:46,409
It's vital you find Hassan.
It all centers around him.

533
00:49:50,172 --> 00:49:51,207
All right.

534
00:49:51,452 --> 00:49:52,851
Mikes and probes first.

535
00:49:53,212 --> 00:49:56,363
Hook up Grant to the com board.
See if he can locate Hassan.

536
00:49:57,132 --> 00:49:58,531
Everything we need is here.

537
00:49:58,772 --> 00:50:00,205
We locate their positions. . .

538
00:50:00,452 --> 00:50:01,931
. . .blow the lights and go night optics.

539
00:50:02,132 --> 00:50:05,283
We hit them hard while they're
still surprised. Let's go.

540
00:50:05,932 --> 00:50:06,762
The bomb.

541
00:50:08,252 --> 00:50:10,846
We don't know if there is one.
I'll take over the plane.

542
00:50:11,092 --> 00:50:14,050
-That's what Travis would do.
-I'm not telling you what to do.

543
00:50:15,092 --> 00:50:18,926
But if the DZ-5's on board,
there's a bomb attached. Find it.

544
00:50:19,132 --> 00:50:22,966
Once this plane left, Hassan made
sure there was no turning back.

545
00:50:23,732 --> 00:50:24,881
He's right.

546
00:50:25,732 --> 00:50:29,088
It could be a pressure-switch timer;
if you land or change altitude. . .

547
00:50:29,332 --> 00:50:33,371
. . .anything could set it off.
You must find it before they hit.

548
00:50:35,212 --> 00:50:37,442
We'll look for it
while we're setting up.

549
00:50:37,692 --> 00:50:39,410
Get the tools and bomb kits.

550
00:50:39,652 --> 00:50:40,767
Let's get started.

551
00:50:43,292 --> 00:50:45,010
Tell me what Hassan looks like.

552
00:50:47,292 --> 00:50:48,566
I can't.

553
00:50:48,812 --> 00:50:51,531
What do you mean?
You're the world's expert on him.

554
00:50:51,772 --> 00:50:55,651
The only known photograph of him
was taken over 25 years ago.

555
00:50:56,412 --> 00:50:57,367
Jesus.

556
00:50:57,732 --> 00:50:59,529
But I'd recognize his voice.

557
00:51:00,012 --> 00:51:02,162
I'd know him if I saw him.

558
00:51:13,132 --> 00:51:15,930
I'm telling you, I saw them.
Americans.

559
00:51:16,412 --> 00:51:17,811
Soldiers.

560
00:55:22,172 --> 00:55:23,605
Baker, Station One.

561
00:55:23,852 --> 00:55:25,922
First-class online.

562
00:55:26,172 --> 00:55:27,241
Go ahead.

563
00:55:31,932 --> 00:55:34,241
Okay, I've got one, first-class cabin.

564
00:55:40,332 --> 00:55:41,765
Now another.

565
00:55:42,092 --> 00:55:43,650
Skorpions on both of them.

566
00:55:47,652 --> 00:55:49,165
Grant, do you copy?

567
00:55:51,252 --> 00:55:52,401
I hear them.

568
00:55:54,972 --> 00:55:56,166
Neither one is Hassan.

569
00:56:05,012 --> 00:56:07,003
Four in the main cabin,
two in the galley.

570
00:56:07,452 --> 00:56:10,808
Four with nine millimeter
skorpions, two AKM/FNC's.

571
00:56:12,292 --> 00:56:14,283
Two more patrolling
the rear cabin.

572
00:56:14,532 --> 00:56:15,362
Heavily armed.

573
00:56:18,772 --> 00:56:20,364
Can you hear them in the galley?

574
00:56:20,812 --> 00:56:22,643
Yeah. Yeah, I hear them.

575
00:56:25,292 --> 00:56:26,202
None of them is our man.

576
00:56:26,932 --> 00:56:28,411
This isn't working.

577
00:56:28,652 --> 00:56:29,687
Meet me in the lower galley.

578
00:56:29,932 --> 00:56:31,809
Put on Cappy's vest.

579
00:56:32,932 --> 00:56:34,411
I'm on my way.

580
00:57:04,132 --> 00:57:06,327
All right, clip the cable to your vest.

581
00:57:09,972 --> 00:57:11,530
Put on your carabiner.

582
00:57:11,772 --> 00:57:12,602
I'll winch you up.

583
00:57:18,572 --> 00:57:19,607
Easy.

584
00:57:46,932 --> 00:57:49,241
I got four probes and mikes down there.

585
00:57:49,492 --> 00:57:50,641
It covers the main cabin.

586
00:57:51,172 --> 00:57:53,561
If he's there,
you should find him.

587
00:58:01,372 --> 00:58:02,327
Whatever you do. . .

588
00:58:02,612 --> 00:58:05,172
. . .don't step on the panel
or you'll go through.

589
00:58:05,412 --> 00:58:07,004
I'll try to remember that.

590
00:58:19,252 --> 00:58:22,164
Hey, wait. Lose the shoes, pretty boy.

591
00:58:23,692 --> 00:58:25,284
Hope the smell doesn't
give us away.

592
00:58:26,612 --> 00:58:27,567
Go.

593
00:59:29,132 --> 00:59:30,087
Senator, l--

594
00:59:30,332 --> 00:59:32,766
Shut up!
Do you want to get us killed?

595
00:59:36,172 --> 00:59:40,131
I think we're being presented with
an incredible opportunity here.

596
00:59:40,372 --> 00:59:41,771
For what?

597
00:59:42,252 --> 00:59:45,244
We always wanted to have
a war record for you.

598
00:59:45,492 --> 00:59:48,609
Some edge with the media
that would put you over the top.

599
00:59:48,852 --> 00:59:51,207
Remember the mileage
Jesse Jackson got. . .

600
00:59:51,452 --> 00:59:54,171
. . .when he negotiated
that hostage release?

601
00:59:55,372 --> 00:59:56,521
Yeah.

602
01:00:02,372 --> 01:00:04,169
I'm at the last one.

603
01:00:04,412 --> 01:00:05,765
He's not here.

604
01:00:06,092 --> 01:00:07,411
Maybe he's in the cockpit.

605
01:00:07,692 --> 01:00:09,125
Come on back.

606
01:00:36,092 --> 01:00:37,684
Come on, I got you.

607
01:00:39,212 --> 01:00:40,611
I got you, it's okay.

608
01:00:43,172 --> 01:00:44,525
That's it.

609
01:00:45,372 --> 01:00:48,364
Just keep tugging.
Good. You got it.

610
01:00:49,492 --> 01:00:51,244
Get your arm in over there.

611
01:01:05,132 --> 01:01:06,929
Maintain current course.

612
01:01:09,612 --> 01:01:10,601
Shit.

613
01:01:13,927 --> 01:01:14,757
Thanks.

614
01:01:15,927 --> 01:01:17,565
Let's get down from here.

615
01:01:43,687 --> 01:01:44,676
Stop.

616
01:01:44,887 --> 01:01:45,842
What's going on?

617
01:01:53,967 --> 01:01:56,003
I'm sorry, it fell. I was. . .

618
01:01:56,247 --> 01:01:57,965
. . .getting coffee filters.

619
01:02:02,967 --> 01:02:04,116
I don't understand.

620
01:02:04,367 --> 01:02:06,085
How does threatening these people. . .

621
01:02:06,327 --> 01:02:09,000
. . .have anything to do with your cause?

622
01:02:09,247 --> 01:02:11,397
It's not your place to understand.

623
01:02:11,807 --> 01:02:13,320
Just be patient.

624
01:02:14,087 --> 01:02:16,043
It'll all be over very soon.

625
01:02:28,167 --> 01:02:29,361
There's a change.

626
01:02:29,607 --> 01:02:30,756
Maintain our course.

627
01:02:51,887 --> 01:02:53,366
Excuse me.

628
01:03:18,887 --> 01:03:20,718
I'm keeping you from your work.

629
01:03:35,807 --> 01:03:37,445
Are you okay? What happened?

630
01:03:37,807 --> 01:03:39,320
Are you okay?

631
01:03:39,647 --> 01:03:40,636
Yeah.

632
01:03:42,407 --> 01:03:44,557
And guess who I ran into?

633
01:04:11,447 --> 01:04:12,357
Rat.

634
01:04:13,047 --> 01:04:16,005
Forward baggage compartment.
Got something.

635
01:04:16,407 --> 01:04:17,920
I'm on my way.

636
01:04:28,807 --> 01:04:30,445
You wanted to talk to me.

637
01:04:31,287 --> 01:04:34,165
I'm sure you're aware
the official U.S. policy is. . .

638
01:04:34,407 --> 01:04:35,362
. . .no deals with terrorists.

639
01:04:35,607 --> 01:04:38,167
Especially in hostage situations.

640
01:04:41,287 --> 01:04:43,562
I can deal directly with the President.

641
01:04:43,927 --> 01:04:46,600
If you allow me to conduct
the negotiation. . .

642
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:48,644
. . .I can guarantee your demands.

643
01:04:48,967 --> 01:04:52,039
Money, media exposure,
safe passage to the Middle East.

644
01:04:53,367 --> 01:04:54,686
I understand.

645
01:04:54,927 --> 01:04:57,805
You want to be seen
as the savior of the hostages.

646
01:04:58,167 --> 01:05:00,681
An image that won't hurt you
in the elections.

647
01:05:02,007 --> 01:05:05,363
As powerful an image as you returning
to the Middle East, mission accomplished.

648
01:05:07,367 --> 01:05:09,517
We are both men who truly understand. . .

649
01:05:09,767 --> 01:05:12,565
. . .the importance of making
dramatic statements.

650
01:05:15,727 --> 01:05:19,163
Rest assured, when the time comes,
I will call upon you.

651
01:05:30,087 --> 01:05:31,998
Your theory was right.

652
01:05:33,007 --> 01:05:34,235
Have a look.

653
01:05:47,727 --> 01:05:49,922
You can forget Washington.

654
01:05:50,767 --> 01:05:54,555
There's enough nerve agent here to
wipe out half the eastern seaboard.

655
01:05:59,487 --> 01:06:02,797
Israeli intelligence has identified
the bomb-maker.

656
01:06:03,047 --> 01:06:05,083
He's Jean-Paul Demou.

657
01:06:05,327 --> 01:06:07,079
That's a recent photograph.

658
01:06:07,327 --> 01:06:08,919
French-Algerian.

659
01:06:09,127 --> 01:06:11,118
Former nuclear engineer
with the lraqis.

660
01:06:11,687 --> 01:06:13,200
Lost his family in the Gulf War.

661
01:06:13,447 --> 01:06:15,563
He's been with Jaffa's group since.

662
01:06:16,647 --> 01:06:17,557
That's it?

663
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:18,683
That's it.

664
01:06:20,527 --> 01:06:23,644
It's been over an hour
and no word from Travis.

665
01:06:24,247 --> 01:06:26,158
We're running out of options.

666
01:06:31,367 --> 01:06:32,720
There's still time.

667
01:06:33,647 --> 01:06:36,286
Instruct the F-1 4's
to be ready to launch.

668
01:06:36,527 --> 01:06:39,758
Issue the press release of
the President's decision to free Jaffa.

669
01:06:40,407 --> 01:06:43,205
That bastard might be
our last avenue of hope.

670
01:06:58,407 --> 01:07:00,602
We have no means
to communicate with him.

671
01:07:00,887 --> 01:07:04,163
But he has arranged to contact you
as soon as you're airborne.

672
01:07:04,767 --> 01:07:08,442
I can assure you, that plane
won't be allowed to reach the U.S.

673
01:07:10,727 --> 01:07:12,160
If you can convince him. . .

674
01:07:12,407 --> 01:07:14,841
. . .to divert the aircraft
to an isolated base. . .

675
01:07:15,087 --> 01:07:16,600
. . .and release the passengers. . .

676
01:07:16,967 --> 01:07:19,925
. . .he has the word of the President
of the United States. . .

677
01:07:20,167 --> 01:07:23,318
. . .he and his men will be given
passage to any country.

678
01:07:26,487 --> 01:07:27,715
I'll do everything I can. . .

679
01:07:28,527 --> 01:07:30,916
. . .in the interests of peace.

680
01:08:10,927 --> 01:08:13,566
Sorry, Cappy. We got a bad one here.

681
01:08:14,887 --> 01:08:15,717
So. . .

682
01:08:17,247 --> 01:08:20,762
. . .we know we've got DZ-5
in binary canisters. . .

683
01:08:21,007 --> 01:08:22,884
. . .and 1 6 pounds of Semtex.

684
01:08:23,087 --> 01:08:24,281
Let's take a look inside.

685
01:08:30,887 --> 01:08:32,320
A computer trigger.

686
01:08:33,127 --> 01:08:35,038
Microprocessor.

687
01:08:36,247 --> 01:08:37,760
Dedicated drive. . .

688
01:08:38,687 --> 01:08:41,155
. . .probably monitor a dozen sensors.

689
01:08:41,407 --> 01:08:44,080
This ain't no pipe bomb
with a six-volt battery.

690
01:08:47,567 --> 01:08:49,080
Take me closer.

691
01:08:52,807 --> 01:08:53,956
Stop.

692
01:08:54,807 --> 01:08:56,286
Take me in on that.

693
01:09:00,567 --> 01:09:01,443
There.

694
01:09:02,087 --> 01:09:03,122
What are you looking at?

695
01:09:03,767 --> 01:09:05,837
That long, silver cylinder.

696
01:09:06,607 --> 01:09:08,962
That's a barometric pressure switch.

697
01:09:09,207 --> 01:09:13,120
Activated on takeoff, probably
set to airburst during landing. . .

698
01:09:15,927 --> 01:09:17,565
. . .with an isolated trigger.

699
01:09:19,847 --> 01:09:21,599
I tell you what. . .

700
01:09:21,847 --> 01:09:22,962
. . .if I can. . .

701
01:09:24,767 --> 01:09:25,756
. . .I mean. . .

702
01:09:26,007 --> 01:09:29,124
. . .if you can disable the switch,
it'll buy you some time.

703
01:09:29,647 --> 01:09:31,160
Then we got a chance.

704
01:09:32,047 --> 01:09:36,165
We shut it down, take over
the plane, land it someplace safe.

705
01:09:39,807 --> 01:09:41,525
Who gets to play
with the bomb?

706
01:09:47,527 --> 01:09:48,482
What about Cahill?

707
01:09:49,847 --> 01:09:52,281
He's a design engineer.
If he can build a computer. . .

708
01:09:52,527 --> 01:09:54,165
. . .he can take one apart.

709
01:09:54,807 --> 01:09:55,796
What do you think?

710
01:09:56,007 --> 01:09:58,760
We're looking up the ass of a
dead dog, but it's worth a try.

711
01:09:59,007 --> 01:10:01,396
But hurry, the morphine's kicking in.

712
01:10:03,367 --> 01:10:04,595
Let's do it.

713
01:10:04,847 --> 01:10:06,166
Get Cahill in here.

714
01:10:06,487 --> 01:10:07,602
Overhead mid-cabin.

715
01:10:07,847 --> 01:10:11,283
First class. I'll take the cockpit
and business class.

716
01:10:11,527 --> 01:10:14,041
Use Channel B to Grant,
keep A open for assault.

717
01:10:14,687 --> 01:10:15,642
I think you have problem.

718
01:10:15,887 --> 01:10:18,685
I counted four in mid-cabin,
but there could be six.

719
01:10:20,007 --> 01:10:22,726
Can you take them all?

720
01:10:23,687 --> 01:10:26,884
I could take three or four,
but that's pushing it.

721
01:10:29,207 --> 01:10:30,799
We need another gun.

722
01:10:40,407 --> 01:10:42,363
What do you want me to do?

723
01:11:12,287 --> 01:11:13,436
Jesus.

724
01:11:22,647 --> 01:11:25,559
We're doing a simple
electronic bypass.

725
01:11:25,847 --> 01:11:27,326
Ignore the rest of it.

726
01:11:29,927 --> 01:11:31,918
Just ignore. . .

727
01:11:32,327 --> 01:11:33,316
. . .the rest of it.

728
01:11:33,567 --> 01:11:35,637
If you screw up, you'll never know it.

729
01:11:38,607 --> 01:11:39,722
So. . .

730
01:11:40,567 --> 01:11:41,966
. . .Iet's get to it.

731
01:11:46,407 --> 01:11:47,362
Once more.

732
01:11:48,847 --> 01:11:50,917
Push hard, up the ladder. . .

733
01:11:52,047 --> 01:11:53,480
. . .Ieft in the companionway.

734
01:11:54,087 --> 01:11:55,486
I'll surprise them.

735
01:11:55,727 --> 01:11:57,001
That's it. You got it.

736
01:11:57,207 --> 01:11:58,401
This isn't my thing.

737
01:11:58,727 --> 01:12:00,285
With that, you can't miss.

738
01:12:00,527 --> 01:12:02,722
Just aim for his chest and fire.

739
01:12:02,967 --> 01:12:05,083
Whatever you do,
don't look into his eyes.

740
01:12:05,327 --> 01:12:07,045
Then come back down the hall.

741
01:12:24,407 --> 01:12:25,999
Okay, Cahill.

742
01:12:26,607 --> 01:12:28,404
Meter reads 1 5 ohms.

743
01:12:28,647 --> 01:12:31,684
That's good. That means
it's in parallel and isolated.

744
01:12:32,047 --> 01:12:33,685
Let's complete the bypass.

745
01:13:04,447 --> 01:13:07,757
Now take the red alligator clips
and set in the bypass.

746
01:13:44,127 --> 01:13:46,038
Now take the red-handled dikes. . .

747
01:13:46,287 --> 01:13:48,960
. . .and put the red wire on this side.

748
01:13:49,647 --> 01:13:51,478
But don't touch anything else.

749
01:14:02,087 --> 01:14:04,521
Ready, forward section.
Sit-rep.

750
01:14:08,487 --> 01:14:09,476
Ready.

751
01:14:13,767 --> 01:14:14,677
Baker up.

752
01:14:16,847 --> 01:14:18,565
I'm ready.

753
01:14:37,167 --> 01:14:37,997
Do it.

754
01:14:50,207 --> 01:14:51,640
Tell them it's all theirs.

755
01:14:52,607 --> 01:14:53,926
Thank God.

756
01:14:56,647 --> 01:14:58,683
Cappy says the bomb is safe.

757
01:14:59,007 --> 01:15:00,645
The dude's in my sights.

758
01:15:01,167 --> 01:15:03,761
I'll blow the lights,
and we go on my signal.

759
01:15:19,287 --> 01:15:20,720
Oh, Jesus!

760
01:15:21,487 --> 01:15:22,283
Stop them.

761
01:15:22,527 --> 01:15:24,040
Tell Rat to stop the attack!

762
01:15:26,887 --> 01:15:29,196
Rat, stop the hit.

763
01:15:29,447 --> 01:15:30,926
Cappy says to stop the attack.

764
01:15:32,607 --> 01:15:33,722
Hold positions.

765
01:15:39,607 --> 01:15:40,756
What's going on?

766
01:15:42,407 --> 01:15:44,602
Someone ran a program test on the bomb.

767
01:15:45,687 --> 01:15:47,040
Whoever it is. . .

768
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:49,045
. . .has an override switch
with his finger. . .

769
01:15:49,367 --> 01:15:50,686
...on the damned trigger!

770
01:15:51,087 --> 01:15:52,486
Can you override it?

771
01:15:58,967 --> 01:16:00,559
I said, can you override it?

772
01:16:08,807 --> 01:16:09,956
What's going on?

773
01:16:18,647 --> 01:16:20,956
I think we might have lost Cappy.

774
01:16:21,167 --> 01:16:23,522
Cappy's dead. I think Cappy's dead.

775
01:16:23,967 --> 01:16:25,036
Calm down.

776
01:16:25,287 --> 01:16:26,402
I'll be right there.

777
01:16:29,087 --> 01:16:30,566
What happened?

778
01:16:53,647 --> 01:16:54,523
Cappy's okay.

779
01:16:54,767 --> 01:16:55,916
Just unconscious.

780
01:17:18,047 --> 01:17:19,958
I am free and in flight.

781
01:17:20,967 --> 01:17:23,356
The Americans wish me to tell you. . .

782
01:17:24,127 --> 01:17:26,038
. . .they agree to all your demands.

783
01:17:26,727 --> 01:17:28,922
You are victorious. Come home.

784
01:17:30,207 --> 01:17:32,767
I rejoice in your freedom, Abu Jaffa.

785
01:17:33,407 --> 01:17:35,284
Allah has blessed us.

786
01:17:35,527 --> 01:17:37,916
A great destiny awaits us both.

787
01:17:38,727 --> 01:17:41,799
You'll see I've achieved
a glorious victory on your behalf.

788
01:17:42,767 --> 01:17:45,804
All of lslam will embrace you
as its chosen leader.

789
01:17:46,047 --> 01:17:46,877
I am your flame.

790
01:17:47,127 --> 01:17:48,765
The sword of Allah.

791
01:17:49,127 --> 01:17:52,403
And with it I will strike deep
into the heart of the infidel.

792
01:17:52,687 --> 01:17:56,123
Listen to me! They know!
They will destroy the plane!

793
01:17:56,367 --> 01:17:57,356
Listen!

794
01:18:02,567 --> 01:18:03,602
He cut him off.

795
01:18:04,807 --> 01:18:06,126
Christ!

796
01:18:14,407 --> 01:18:15,840
Jaffa's free.

797
01:18:17,407 --> 01:18:18,726
Jaffa's free!

798
01:18:28,007 --> 01:18:30,475
Anytime, guys. Anytime.

799
01:18:40,327 --> 01:18:43,922
Tell Admiral Crosby to order
the F-1 4's to intercept the 747.

800
01:18:44,167 --> 01:18:45,998
Make the plane divert.

801
01:18:46,207 --> 01:18:47,003
Do it.

802
01:18:50,327 --> 01:18:51,965
Call the President.

803
01:18:52,567 --> 01:18:54,558
It's an executive decision now.

804
01:19:35,207 --> 01:19:38,722
Now that Abu Jaffa's free,
shall I order the plane to Algeria?

805
01:19:41,007 --> 01:19:41,917
Why?

806
01:19:47,447 --> 01:19:49,324
-What's going on?
-Jaffa's been freed.

807
01:19:50,767 --> 01:19:54,237
The second-in-command
is challenging Hassan.

808
01:19:55,047 --> 01:19:56,526
He wants to know. . .

809
01:19:57,287 --> 01:19:59,164
. . .why they're not diverting to Algeria. . .

810
01:19:59,407 --> 01:20:00,840
. . .now that Jaffa's been released.

811
01:20:01,207 --> 01:20:05,803
Allah has chosen for us a task
far greater than Jaffa's freedom.

812
01:20:07,327 --> 01:20:09,921
We are the true soldiers of lslam.

813
01:20:10,727 --> 01:20:12,558
Our destiny is to deliver
the vengence of Allah. . .

814
01:20:12,807 --> 01:20:14,365
. . .into the belly of the infidel.

815
01:20:17,407 --> 01:20:20,877
This has nothing to do with lslam.
It is not Allah's will.

816
01:20:21,127 --> 01:20:24,278
You're blinded by hatred.
I'll have nothing to do with it.

817
01:20:24,527 --> 01:20:27,405
Our mission was to free Abu Jaffa.
He is our leader, not you.

818
01:20:46,047 --> 01:20:47,480
What happened?

819
01:20:49,927 --> 01:20:51,758
He just killed one of his men.

820
01:20:57,207 --> 01:20:58,640
Get back to your posts.

821
01:21:04,607 --> 01:21:07,644
You son of a bitch!
What'd you get me into?

822
01:21:07,887 --> 01:21:09,843
What did you get me into?

823
01:21:12,607 --> 01:21:14,643
The others can't know about the bomb.

824
01:21:16,647 --> 01:21:19,844
But somebody ran a test.
There must be a sleeper.

825
01:21:20,087 --> 01:21:21,805
Triggerman. One of the passengers.

826
01:21:22,287 --> 01:21:24,482
There're 400 passengers.
It could be anyone.

827
01:21:24,727 --> 01:21:25,876
No way we'll find him.

828
01:21:26,087 --> 01:21:28,043
We still have the element of surprise.

829
01:21:28,287 --> 01:21:30,881
Let's hit them now,
forget the bomb and maybe get lucky.

830
01:21:31,127 --> 01:21:34,642
Even if you kill them all,
the sleeper can destroy the plane.

831
01:21:36,247 --> 01:21:38,522
But at least we'll save Washington.

832
01:21:40,407 --> 01:21:43,444
We're out of time.
This is the best option we have.

833
01:21:44,087 --> 01:21:44,997
Maybe not.

834
01:21:46,007 --> 01:21:48,316
We still got an hour and 20 minutes.

835
01:21:48,567 --> 01:21:51,718
Listen, we must give
that bomb another try.

836
01:21:51,967 --> 01:21:53,639
You need Cappy for that.

837
01:21:53,887 --> 01:21:55,445
-Maybe Cahill can.
-Forget it.

838
01:21:55,687 --> 01:21:58,918
If he can neutralize it,
finding the sleeper won't matter.

839
01:21:59,127 --> 01:22:00,355
And if he can't?

840
01:22:00,607 --> 01:22:02,563
Then we must find the sleeper.

841
01:22:02,887 --> 01:22:04,161
But I think. . .

842
01:22:05,087 --> 01:22:06,805
. . .I know who it might be.

843
01:22:07,047 --> 01:22:08,241
Can you hook up a probe. . .

844
01:22:08,487 --> 01:22:10,876
. . .so I can see
into the cabin on this monitor?

845
01:22:11,807 --> 01:22:14,844
We can't transmit between
the probe and the monitor.

846
01:22:15,087 --> 01:22:16,645
Would a video camera work?

847
01:22:16,887 --> 01:22:18,240
-You got one?
-No.

848
01:22:18,767 --> 01:22:19,882
Shit.

849
01:22:21,087 --> 01:22:23,726
Baggage.
We'll find one in baggage.

850
01:22:24,847 --> 01:22:26,485
There are 400 faces up there.

851
01:22:26,727 --> 01:22:28,638
You'll check each one?

852
01:22:29,127 --> 01:22:30,560
Not without help.

853
01:22:37,487 --> 01:22:39,159
Where's the weak link?

854
01:22:40,047 --> 01:22:42,481
How do we pull
the teeth on this thing?

855
01:22:44,847 --> 01:22:47,600
Come on, you're an engineer.
Go with your instincts.

856
01:22:52,087 --> 01:22:54,282
Cappy said two power sources.

857
01:22:55,207 --> 01:22:56,560
This is one.

858
01:22:57,087 --> 01:22:59,123
I'm pretty sure this is the other.

859
01:23:00,607 --> 01:23:02,916
If we had our own power supply. . .

860
01:23:04,127 --> 01:23:06,800
. . .we could isolate
the bomb's power sources. . .

861
01:23:07,287 --> 01:23:08,879
. . .Iike a heart bypass machine.

862
01:23:09,087 --> 01:23:10,520
The bomb'll think it's online.

863
01:23:10,767 --> 01:23:13,998
Along with the sleeper. With no power,
no detonation. Brilliant.

864
01:23:14,527 --> 01:23:16,085
In theory.

865
01:23:16,327 --> 01:23:17,555
That's all we've got.

866
01:23:36,487 --> 01:23:39,843
Cahill, you're the man.
Go with your instincts.

867
01:23:48,087 --> 01:23:49,600
I hope I'm right.

868
01:23:51,047 --> 01:23:53,959
Whatever you do, don't cut that wire.

869
01:24:00,687 --> 01:24:03,440
We found a camcorder in baggage.
We're ready to try this.

870
01:24:03,687 --> 01:24:04,642
Be right there.

871
01:24:06,327 --> 01:24:08,682
What? You can't leave now.

872
01:24:10,327 --> 01:24:11,521
You've got Cappy.

873
01:24:13,327 --> 01:24:15,079
What if he passes out again?

874
01:24:15,967 --> 01:24:17,958
If things really get desperate. . .

875
01:24:19,007 --> 01:24:21,043
. . .use your magic wand.

876
01:24:37,527 --> 01:24:39,358
Okay. I got power.

877
01:24:40,727 --> 01:24:44,322
Got the cable down the elevator shaft.
They won't see it.

878
01:24:53,207 --> 01:24:55,118
Now for the hard part.

879
01:24:56,927 --> 01:24:58,076
Let's try this.

880
01:24:58,727 --> 01:24:59,876
Call light button.

881
01:25:00,847 --> 01:25:02,439
I bypassed the buzzer.

882
01:25:02,807 --> 01:25:04,479
Let's hope she sees it.

883
01:25:04,727 --> 01:25:07,878
Wait. What makes you think
you can trust her?

884
01:25:09,447 --> 01:25:11,085
When I was in the elevator. . .

885
01:25:11,447 --> 01:25:13,403
. . .she saw me when Hassan walked in.

886
01:25:13,927 --> 01:25:15,076
Wait!

887
01:25:15,327 --> 01:25:17,921
She was cool, she covered me.
She'll do this.

888
01:25:19,847 --> 01:25:22,839
I just hope you have better luck
with women than I do.

889
01:25:37,447 --> 01:25:39,199
Come on, pick it up.

890
01:25:41,287 --> 01:25:42,163
Pick it up.

891
01:25:51,247 --> 01:25:53,841
I'm watching you on video.
Behind you. . .

892
01:25:54,127 --> 01:25:55,685
...above the bulkhead.

893
01:25:58,887 --> 01:25:59,683
There you go.

894
01:26:00,567 --> 01:26:02,000
We met in the elevator.

895
01:26:02,927 --> 01:26:06,522
American soldiers are onboard,
ready to take over the plane.

896
01:26:06,887 --> 01:26:10,243
But there's a bomb,
and a passenger is in control of it.

897
01:26:10,727 --> 01:26:12,718
We need your help to find him.

898
01:26:13,327 --> 01:26:16,285
You're looking for a man
with an electronic device.

899
01:26:16,567 --> 01:26:17,556
He's probably--

900
01:26:21,607 --> 01:26:24,246
Sorry. I thought the phone rang.

901
01:26:40,207 --> 01:26:41,162
Jesus.

902
01:26:53,887 --> 01:26:55,161
Get on with it.

903
01:27:03,767 --> 01:27:05,519
Come on, hang in there.

904
01:27:06,447 --> 01:27:07,482
Hang in there.

905
01:27:10,247 --> 01:27:12,442
She's had it. Forget it.

906
01:27:29,007 --> 01:27:30,838
She's shaking.
She's not going to do it.

907
01:27:31,247 --> 01:27:32,396
Wait a minute.

908
01:27:40,407 --> 01:27:42,602
Lady's a player. She's with us.

909
01:27:44,127 --> 01:27:45,606
Get in position.

910
01:27:45,927 --> 01:27:50,000
Get upstairs. If she fingers somebody,
we must move fast.

911
01:28:02,087 --> 01:28:03,156
They're here.

912
01:28:20,287 --> 01:28:25,042
Oceanic Flight 343, approximately
120 miles from fail-safe line.

913
01:28:25,287 --> 01:28:28,518
I've spoken to the President.
He concurs.

914
01:28:31,367 --> 01:28:34,643
If we can't make them divert,
we have no other option.

915
01:28:35,327 --> 01:28:39,764
The F-1 4's should intercept
in approximately 1 5 minutes.

916
01:28:40,927 --> 01:28:43,680
We're not going to
shoot this plane down, are we?

917
01:28:43,927 --> 01:28:46,999
Whatever evidence there is
will go to the bottom of the ocean.

918
01:28:47,407 --> 01:28:50,444
The President would be finished.
He'd never recover.

919
01:28:51,767 --> 01:28:53,280
Four hundred American lives.

920
01:28:53,527 --> 01:28:56,439
We'd all be finished,
the whole administration.

921
01:29:06,567 --> 01:29:10,162
Miss, may I have some water
for my medication?

922
01:29:10,447 --> 01:29:11,243
My pleasure.

923
01:29:11,487 --> 01:29:12,920
-Oh, dear.
-I'll get it for you.

924
01:29:19,327 --> 01:29:20,203
What are you doing?

925
01:29:20,447 --> 01:29:22,722
I was just getting her medication.

926
01:29:27,967 --> 01:29:29,719
Can I go get her some water?

927
01:29:30,647 --> 01:29:31,523
Go!

928
01:29:52,927 --> 01:29:55,157
That's it. You got something, don't you?

929
01:30:04,407 --> 01:30:05,965
Not long enough. One something.

930
01:30:06,447 --> 01:30:08,403
-Did you get it?
-No, it was too quick.

931
01:30:08,887 --> 01:30:11,003
She'll give it to us again. She must.

932
01:30:19,007 --> 01:30:20,486
Here she comes.

933
01:30:23,007 --> 01:30:24,679
-2, 1 --
-"K. "

934
01:30:24,927 --> 01:30:25,916
21 -K!

935
01:30:31,847 --> 01:30:33,075
Slap Flight, this is Lead.

936
01:30:33,567 --> 01:30:38,163
Contact 0-3-9 at 125.
Come left 0- 1-5 for collision.

937
01:30:38,407 --> 01:30:40,875
Three's contact and concur.
Angel's 44.

938
01:30:46,367 --> 01:30:47,516
She found something.

939
01:30:47,767 --> 01:30:49,120
21-K.

940
01:30:49,367 --> 01:30:50,686
Midsection. . .

941
01:30:51,007 --> 01:30:51,996
. . .starboard side.

942
01:30:52,247 --> 01:30:53,316
Window seat.

943
01:30:53,767 --> 01:30:55,723
Roger, I'm on my way.

944
01:31:11,167 --> 01:31:12,600
I can't do it.

945
01:31:15,367 --> 01:31:16,595
I can't. . .

946
01:31:16,847 --> 01:31:17,757
. . .breathe.

947
01:31:19,007 --> 01:31:20,406
Just relax.

948
01:31:21,207 --> 01:31:22,196
I'm right here.

949
01:31:25,727 --> 01:31:26,523
Close your eyes.

950
01:31:27,047 --> 01:31:27,877
Why?

951
01:31:28,327 --> 01:31:30,363
Just close your eyes.

952
01:31:35,007 --> 01:31:36,042
Breathe deep.

953
01:31:43,487 --> 01:31:46,638
Open your eyes and cut the blue wire.

954
01:32:12,487 --> 01:32:13,317
It's a decoy!

955
01:32:13,567 --> 01:32:17,958
It's a fake! The real works must
be down below under the plate.

956
01:32:18,167 --> 01:32:20,476
What the hell happened?
What is going on?

957
01:32:20,727 --> 01:32:21,796
I'm sorry.

958
01:32:22,007 --> 01:32:25,397
It's just, the whole goddamn thing
could just blow up!

959
01:32:25,647 --> 01:32:26,796
Speak English!

960
01:32:27,007 --> 01:32:28,440
I screwed up.

961
01:32:31,487 --> 01:32:33,239
We have to start over.

962
01:32:42,647 --> 01:32:43,796
Grant, I'm there.

963
01:32:44,047 --> 01:32:45,719
If it's Demou, he's about 50...

964
01:32:46,007 --> 01:32:47,804
. . .olive skin, dark hair, balding.

965
01:32:50,607 --> 01:32:53,075
It could be. I can't see him clearly.

966
01:32:53,327 --> 01:32:55,557
I can't get a clean shot. Louie?

967
01:32:56,127 --> 01:32:57,480
His back is to me.

968
01:32:58,247 --> 01:32:59,999
But he fits the description.

969
01:33:01,127 --> 01:33:02,799
Demou. It has to be.

970
01:33:03,047 --> 01:33:04,241
Can you take him?

971
01:33:04,487 --> 01:33:05,602
Not a chance.

972
01:33:05,847 --> 01:33:07,997
There's passengers all around him.

973
01:33:13,367 --> 01:33:15,676
-Where'd they come from?!
-I don't know.

974
01:33:18,847 --> 01:33:20,519
Nagi, fighter planes!

975
01:33:20,927 --> 01:33:23,760
Slap, Strike One Tally Ho.
Assuming position for escort.

976
01:33:39,007 --> 01:33:43,046
Oceanic Flight 343, this is
flight leader, U. S. Navy aircraft.

977
01:33:43,487 --> 01:33:45,796
You are approaching U. S. airspace.

978
01:33:46,047 --> 01:33:48,766
You are to divert heading 0-2-0.

979
01:33:49,087 --> 01:33:51,396
Fix vector for Thule Air Force Base.

980
01:33:51,647 --> 01:33:54,366
Divert. Steer 0-2-0.

981
01:33:54,647 --> 01:33:57,286
Squawk 7500 to acknowledge.

982
01:33:57,887 --> 01:34:02,403
Oceanic Flight 343, this is
flight leader, U. S. Navy aircraft.

983
01:34:03,647 --> 01:34:05,842
Son of a bitch.

984
01:34:06,847 --> 01:34:09,122
Divert to Thule Air Force Base.

985
01:34:09,487 --> 01:34:10,840
0-2-0.

986
01:34:11,447 --> 01:34:13,642
Navy jets ordering us to divert.

987
01:34:13,887 --> 01:34:16,481
-We must be close to fail-safe.
-We've had it.

988
01:34:16,767 --> 01:34:17,836
They'll shoot us down.

989
01:34:18,087 --> 01:34:20,362
No, no. We've got to
signal them somehow.

990
01:34:20,607 --> 01:34:22,165
Got to be a way.

991
01:34:22,407 --> 01:34:24,204
Come on, think. Think.

992
01:34:24,447 --> 01:34:27,359
Vector 0-2-0. Thule Air Force Base.
Acknowledge.

993
01:34:27,727 --> 01:34:31,322
Oceanic Flight 343.
On guard. Turn right.

994
01:34:33,167 --> 01:34:34,759
Got to do something.

995
01:34:35,607 --> 01:34:37,484
Look out your left window.

996
01:34:37,887 --> 01:34:40,560
This is U. S. Navy flight lead.

997
01:34:40,807 --> 01:34:42,798
Show me a sign you understand.

998
01:34:43,047 --> 01:34:44,844
What the hell are they doing?

999
01:34:45,367 --> 01:34:46,925
Getting ready to light us up.

1000
01:34:52,047 --> 01:34:53,924
-Take that left clip.
-I got it.

1001
01:34:55,887 --> 01:34:57,036
Okay. I got it.

1002
01:34:57,327 --> 01:34:58,157
That's 77.

1003
01:34:58,407 --> 01:35:01,843
Flight 343. It is imperative
that you acknowledge.

1004
01:35:02,087 --> 01:35:04,157
Divert now. Steer 0-2-0.

1005
01:35:04,647 --> 01:35:05,875
This is U. S. Navy flight lead.

1006
01:35:06,127 --> 01:35:07,116
We must respond.

1007
01:35:07,367 --> 01:35:09,244
You say nothing.
Stay on course.

1008
01:35:14,407 --> 01:35:15,317
Now.

1009
01:35:29,647 --> 01:35:30,602
It looks clear.

1010
01:35:31,167 --> 01:35:35,524
We need something non-metallic
to slip between those points.

1011
01:35:52,007 --> 01:35:54,999
I think we've got it licked,
but we need a few more minutes.

1012
01:35:55,247 --> 01:35:56,760
Great. Stay at it.

1013
01:35:57,007 --> 01:35:59,646
All right, listen. Pin 77's over here.

1014
01:35:59,887 --> 01:36:03,197
Slap Flight, this is Lead.
I'm going to pull out in front.

1015
01:36:15,087 --> 01:36:16,281
What are we missing?

1016
01:36:16,647 --> 01:36:18,205
I'm thinking the same thing.

1017
01:36:19,367 --> 01:36:20,925
The sphere is cold.

1018
01:36:22,047 --> 01:36:25,119
In my green bag,
there's a can of compressed air.

1019
01:36:25,767 --> 01:36:26,836
Give it a shot.

1020
01:36:40,487 --> 01:36:41,806
Shit.

1021
01:36:47,487 --> 01:36:49,762
In my kit, infrared goggles.

1022
01:36:59,847 --> 01:37:01,121
Jesus Christ.

1023
01:37:02,247 --> 01:37:03,680
We're finished.

1024
01:37:04,687 --> 01:37:06,962
One more time. Oceanic Flight 343.

1025
01:37:07,207 --> 01:37:09,801
Come right 0-2-0. Thule Air Force Base.

1026
01:37:10,087 --> 01:37:11,406
Give me Washington.

1027
01:37:13,487 --> 01:37:16,718
You must follow me.
Captain, please acknowledge.

1028
01:37:16,967 --> 01:37:18,195
This is AI Tha 'r.

1029
01:37:18,447 --> 01:37:19,596
Why are we being threatened?

1030
01:37:19,847 --> 01:37:22,725
I said my terms are absolute.
The hostages will be released...

1031
01:37:22,967 --> 01:37:25,037
... when we land in Washington.

1032
01:37:25,407 --> 01:37:26,601
No compromises.

1033
01:37:26,887 --> 01:37:29,924
This is Secretary of Defense
Charles White.

1034
01:37:30,567 --> 01:37:32,876
You must listen to me.
We know--

1035
01:37:33,087 --> 01:37:34,600
You know nothing!

1036
01:37:35,207 --> 01:37:36,765
Tell your President. . .

1037
01:37:37,007 --> 01:37:40,317
...he will comply or suffer
the blood of Americans on board.

1038
01:37:44,807 --> 01:37:46,081
It's time, Senator.

1039
01:37:50,327 --> 01:37:52,795
Hello? Are you there?
Can you hear me?

1040
01:37:56,127 --> 01:37:57,879
Hello, can you hear me?

1041
01:37:58,567 --> 01:38:02,321
This is Senator Mavros.
I'd like to speak to the President.

1042
01:38:02,567 --> 01:38:05,081
Senator, the President
is out of the country.

1043
01:38:05,327 --> 01:38:06,965
I'm speaking on his behalf.

1044
01:38:07,207 --> 01:38:09,675
I don't care.
I want to speak to him now.

1045
01:38:09,927 --> 01:38:12,521
Senator, I'm in charge
of the crisis team.

1046
01:38:14,047 --> 01:38:16,083
They have a gun to my head.

1047
01:38:16,327 --> 01:38:18,397
Please, just do what they want!

1048
01:38:19,687 --> 01:38:20,961
Please!

1049
01:38:23,207 --> 01:38:24,686
What was that?

1050
01:38:28,687 --> 01:38:29,881
What happened?

1051
01:38:30,727 --> 01:38:32,524
Jesus Christ.

1052
01:38:32,967 --> 01:38:34,559
This is the pilot.

1053
01:38:35,127 --> 01:38:37,687
They killed the senator.
Do what they ask.

1054
01:38:38,887 --> 01:38:40,445
He killed Mavros.

1055
01:38:41,647 --> 01:38:43,842
Whatever you're going to do,
do it now.

1056
01:38:48,807 --> 01:38:50,320
Listen to me.

1057
01:38:50,567 --> 01:38:52,717
The plane will continue on as planned.

1058
01:38:52,967 --> 01:38:57,279
Any further threats will result in
a passenger being killed every minute.

1059
01:38:58,367 --> 01:39:01,484
They're only 25 miles
to the fail-safe line.

1060
01:39:10,287 --> 01:39:11,959
We have to end this now.

1061
01:39:33,567 --> 01:39:37,765
Nav. Com. flash on the CRN-1 1 5.
National Command Authority.

1062
01:39:38,007 --> 01:39:39,838
We're ordered to destroy the target.

1063
01:39:40,287 --> 01:39:41,720
You're joking.

1064
01:39:41,967 --> 01:39:44,322
I confirmed it twice. It's for real.

1065
01:39:45,647 --> 01:39:48,002
Slap Two, Three and Four,
take high cover.

1066
01:39:48,327 --> 01:39:50,045
Follow on a one-mile trail.

1067
01:39:50,287 --> 01:39:51,561
Sparrow select.

1068
01:40:02,327 --> 01:40:04,966
Strike Slap One, stand by
for Fox One from Lead.

1069
01:40:05,847 --> 01:40:07,565
I'm going master arm on.

1070
01:40:13,527 --> 01:40:14,755
Do it.

1071
01:40:18,647 --> 01:40:19,716
Slap Flight, this is Lead.

1072
01:40:20,367 --> 01:40:22,164
We have full lock on the heavy.

1073
01:40:38,767 --> 01:40:39,563
Negative!

1074
01:40:39,807 --> 01:40:41,320
Go cold on the sparrow!

1075
01:40:43,567 --> 01:40:45,159
The taillights are flashing.

1076
01:40:46,607 --> 01:40:48,837
Hope I'm not going too fast.

1077
01:40:49,647 --> 01:40:51,000
Nobody uses Morse code now.

1078
01:40:51,247 --> 01:40:52,362
Except navy pilots.

1079
01:40:52,887 --> 01:40:54,161
Keep sending it.

1080
01:40:54,607 --> 01:40:55,756
Is that what I think?

1081
01:40:56,327 --> 01:40:57,476
You're damn right!

1082
01:41:00,047 --> 01:41:01,275
This is Slap One.

1083
01:41:01,527 --> 01:41:03,995
We have visual communication
from the target.

1084
01:41:04,287 --> 01:41:07,040
Seems to be Morse code coming
from the nav lights.

1085
01:41:07,927 --> 01:41:09,724
According to my supplement...

1086
01:41:09,967 --> 01:41:12,561
... the message appears
to be, " Hail Mary. . .

1087
01:41:12,807 --> 01:41:14,559
. . .Alpha One. . .

1088
01:41:14,807 --> 01:41:16,559
. . . 1 0 minutes. "

1089
01:41:16,927 --> 01:41:17,723
Message repeats.

1090
01:41:17,967 --> 01:41:19,605
Alpha One's the attack code.

1091
01:41:20,607 --> 01:41:22,677
You mean they made it?
They're onboard?

1092
01:41:22,927 --> 01:41:24,121
They'll try to take her.

1093
01:41:24,367 --> 01:41:26,927
It's too late.
They've crossed the line.

1094
01:41:27,167 --> 01:41:30,637
If they're on board,
we'll give them another 1 0 minutes.

1095
01:41:32,887 --> 01:41:34,320
Admiral Lewis.

1096
01:41:38,687 --> 01:41:39,836
Flight 343...

1097
01:41:40,087 --> 01:41:41,839
. . .this is Navy flight leader.

1098
01:41:47,207 --> 01:41:49,926
Alpha One, you have 10 minutes
to U. S. airspace.

1099
01:41:50,167 --> 01:41:51,725
Repeat. Alpha One...

1100
01:41:51,967 --> 01:41:53,958
... 10 minutes to U. S. airspace.

1101
01:41:54,647 --> 01:41:59,277
You have permission to land
at Dulles Airport. Good luck, sir.

1102
01:41:59,647 --> 01:42:00,841
They got it!

1103
01:42:01,687 --> 01:42:02,483
Really?

1104
01:42:02,687 --> 01:42:03,483
They got it!

1105
01:42:04,567 --> 01:42:08,355
I should take back every
squid-hating thing I ever said.

1106
01:42:13,687 --> 01:42:15,120
Monitor the radio.

1107
01:42:15,487 --> 01:42:17,000
And no contact.

1108
01:42:19,767 --> 01:42:20,722
We got a break.

1109
01:42:21,207 --> 01:42:22,435
We have 10 minutes.

1110
01:42:22,687 --> 01:42:24,598
We'll take the sleeper first.

1111
01:42:25,207 --> 01:42:28,324
It must be by surprise.
Cappy's almost there on the bomb.

1112
01:42:28,567 --> 01:42:29,761
Wait a few minutes.

1113
01:42:30,007 --> 01:42:30,996
We're out of time.

1114
01:42:31,247 --> 01:42:33,636
We go, blow out the lights,
take our chances.

1115
01:42:33,887 --> 01:42:34,956
Five minutes, Rat.

1116
01:42:35,207 --> 01:42:37,163
They'll have the bomb diffused by then.

1117
01:42:37,407 --> 01:42:39,045
Now give it 5 minutes!

1118
01:42:43,447 --> 01:42:44,766
Give him 5 minutes.

1119
01:42:46,167 --> 01:42:47,077
I agree.

1120
01:42:50,007 --> 01:42:51,486
All right, Grant. . .

1121
01:42:51,927 --> 01:42:53,246
. . .5 minutes.

1122
01:42:53,847 --> 01:42:56,361
Baker, get into position.
Louie, stand by.

1123
01:43:12,447 --> 01:43:14,119
We have 5 minutes.
How you doing?

1124
01:43:14,447 --> 01:43:16,039
Where were you?

1125
01:43:16,727 --> 01:43:19,639
The sphere is filled
with photoelectric beams.

1126
01:43:19,887 --> 01:43:21,445
We need more than 5 minutes.

1127
01:43:24,527 --> 01:43:25,846
Grant, come in!

1128
01:43:26,527 --> 01:43:28,438
Just do the best you can.

1129
01:44:10,287 --> 01:44:11,606
Pick it up.

1130
01:44:19,247 --> 01:44:20,043
Jan...

1131
01:44:20,287 --> 01:44:22,164
. . .you've been fantastic.

1132
01:44:23,287 --> 01:44:25,721
But I need your help one more time.

1133
01:44:26,007 --> 01:44:27,440
Lower galley.

1134
01:44:28,047 --> 01:44:31,278
Turn around.
Get in the elevator right now. Go.

1135
01:44:54,287 --> 01:44:56,039
They'll start descending soon.

1136
01:44:56,287 --> 01:44:58,118
I know, Jack.

1137
01:45:00,367 --> 01:45:04,838
Radar confirmation. Oceanic Flight 343
now at 25-mile limit.

1138
01:45:15,247 --> 01:45:16,680
Keep going.

1139
01:45:20,247 --> 01:45:21,362
I'll blow the lights.

1140
01:45:22,127 --> 01:45:24,402
Two more minutes and then we go.

1141
01:45:24,727 --> 01:45:26,160
Grant, how are you?

1142
01:46:00,687 --> 01:46:02,325
Just keep walking.

1143
01:46:06,607 --> 01:46:07,881
It's Grant.

1144
01:46:08,127 --> 01:46:10,322
He's down below in mid-cabin.

1145
01:46:10,847 --> 01:46:12,565
When I push you down. . .

1146
01:46:13,167 --> 01:46:14,919
. . .hit the floor and stay down.

1147
01:46:15,647 --> 01:46:16,841
He's going for the sleeper!

1148
01:46:17,047 --> 01:46:18,799
That son of a bitch.

1149
01:46:21,527 --> 01:46:23,597
We go on your signal.

1150
01:46:26,927 --> 01:46:28,155
Go!

1151
01:46:35,807 --> 01:46:36,842
Something's wrong.

1152
01:46:38,687 --> 01:46:39,642
It's not him.

1153
01:46:48,247 --> 01:46:49,157
Everybody down!

1154
01:46:52,767 --> 01:46:53,802
Behind you!

1155
01:47:02,527 --> 01:47:04,245
He's got Demou! Blow the lights!

1156
01:47:35,847 --> 01:47:37,041
The sleeper!

1157
01:49:01,007 --> 01:49:03,282
The straw! The straw!

1158
01:49:27,607 --> 01:49:29,325
I can't hold it!

1159
01:49:50,567 --> 01:49:52,000
Come in, Dulles.

1160
01:49:53,167 --> 01:49:56,318
Dulles, this is Oceanic 343 heavy. . .

1161
01:49:56,567 --> 01:49:58,398
...requesting emergency landing.

1162
01:49:58,647 --> 01:50:01,207
We are low on fuel.
We have structural damage...

1163
01:50:01,447 --> 01:50:03,836
...but we are stable and in control.

1164
01:50:04,087 --> 01:50:05,281
This is Dulles.

1165
01:50:05,527 --> 01:50:06,880
You are cleared to land.

1166
01:50:07,127 --> 01:50:09,402
1-L north. Crash crew standing by.

1167
01:50:10,007 --> 01:50:11,122
Thank God.

1168
01:50:11,367 --> 01:50:12,766
They're in control.

1169
01:50:38,807 --> 01:50:41,162
The bomb! What about the bomb?!

1170
01:50:42,127 --> 01:50:43,719
Listen to this.

1171
01:50:44,887 --> 01:50:46,036
It's done!

1172
01:50:50,727 --> 01:50:52,080
Jesus!

1173
01:50:52,687 --> 01:50:53,483
It's done!

1174
01:50:53,727 --> 01:50:55,126
You got anything else for us?

1175
01:50:55,367 --> 01:50:57,198
Got to tell Washington.

1176
01:50:58,887 --> 01:51:00,081
You okay?

1177
01:51:17,687 --> 01:51:18,836
It's over.

1178
01:51:20,047 --> 01:51:21,366
Over?

1179
01:51:22,647 --> 01:51:24,365
It's not over.

1180
01:51:28,007 --> 01:51:29,326
It's over.

1181
01:51:31,327 --> 01:51:32,555
Who are you?

1182
01:51:34,847 --> 01:51:36,644
No one.

1183
01:51:39,727 --> 01:51:41,001
You're very clever.

1184
01:51:41,887 --> 01:51:43,206
But you're too late.

1185
01:51:43,607 --> 01:51:45,279
You've stopped nothing!

1186
01:52:40,967 --> 01:52:42,446
Dulles lnternational. . .

1187
01:52:42,687 --> 01:52:43,676
. . .this is Flight 343.

1188
01:52:43,927 --> 01:52:46,521
The airplane is secure, but the
pilots are dead. Request help.

1189
01:52:46,767 --> 01:52:48,723
Flight 343, you're breaking up.

1190
01:52:48,967 --> 01:52:53,438
We don 't read you. You're cleared
to land on runway 1-L north.

1191
01:52:53,687 --> 01:52:55,040
I need help. I need instruction.

1192
01:52:55,687 --> 01:52:57,757
There's a bomb
that could detonate on impact.

1193
01:52:58,047 --> 01:52:59,366
You're breaking up.

1194
01:52:59,607 --> 01:53:00,676
They're not receiving.

1195
01:53:00,927 --> 01:53:01,916
Shit!

1196
01:53:02,927 --> 01:53:05,760
Get ahold of it now.
Get ahold of this plane.

1197
01:53:08,887 --> 01:53:10,639
It's all right.
It'll be okay.

1198
01:53:13,207 --> 01:53:15,198
All right, stick and rudder.

1199
01:53:15,447 --> 01:53:17,278
Stick and rudder. It's an airplane.

1200
01:53:17,687 --> 01:53:19,678
Straight and level. Hold it.

1201
01:53:22,967 --> 01:53:24,400
Oh, my God.

1202
01:53:26,767 --> 01:53:28,325
Are you a pilot?

1203
01:53:28,927 --> 01:53:29,837
You got to help me.

1204
01:53:30,567 --> 01:53:33,479
I've had a few lessons,
but I've never really soloed.

1205
01:53:35,607 --> 01:53:37,359
We're probably lined up for landing.

1206
01:53:37,607 --> 01:53:39,518
There it is! There's the airport.

1207
01:53:39,767 --> 01:53:40,995
There, see it?

1208
01:53:41,247 --> 01:53:43,124
Okay, I got it. I got it.
All right.

1209
01:53:43,927 --> 01:53:47,203
Pilot's Operating Handbook.
That's what I need. Over there.

1210
01:53:47,647 --> 01:53:49,319
I don't see it.
What's it look like?

1211
01:53:49,567 --> 01:53:50,966
It'll say, "Flight Manual. "

1212
01:53:51,287 --> 01:53:52,800
Back there! ln the back.

1213
01:53:53,767 --> 01:53:56,565
Okay, I got it, I got it.
Flight manual.

1214
01:53:57,087 --> 01:54:00,124
-What do I look for?
-The normal procedures.

1215
01:54:00,367 --> 01:54:01,925
Landing approach speeds.

1216
01:54:02,447 --> 01:54:03,960
Okay, here it is. I got it.

1217
01:54:04,167 --> 01:54:05,361
What's it say?

1218
01:54:05,607 --> 01:54:07,359
Final approach speeds. . .

1219
01:54:08,247 --> 01:54:10,317
" . . .over 600,000 pounds, 1 50 knots. . .

1220
01:54:10,567 --> 01:54:12,797
. . .under 400,000 pounds, 1 20 knots. "

1221
01:54:13,047 --> 01:54:14,765
Split it. 1 40 knots.

1222
01:54:15,007 --> 01:54:16,406
We're doing 220 knots.

1223
01:54:17,327 --> 01:54:18,476
Reduce power.

1224
01:54:18,727 --> 01:54:20,206
Nose down.

1225
01:54:25,047 --> 01:54:26,685
1 70 knots.

1226
01:54:28,447 --> 01:54:30,005
It's getting loose.

1227
01:54:32,367 --> 01:54:34,164
I'm losing control of the airplane.

1228
01:54:36,047 --> 01:54:37,082
What's wrong?

1229
01:54:38,167 --> 01:54:39,077
Flaps!

1230
01:54:40,007 --> 01:54:41,998
How much flaps can I put on?

1231
01:54:43,767 --> 01:54:47,680
Flaps, flaps, flaps. 1 70 knots--
any amount of flaps you want.

1232
01:54:50,007 --> 01:54:51,156
Goddamn it!

1233
01:54:55,327 --> 01:54:56,555
2, 3, 4.

1234
01:54:59,727 --> 01:55:01,399
There. 1 60.

1235
01:55:01,647 --> 01:55:02,921
There we go. 1 50.

1236
01:55:03,167 --> 01:55:04,395
1 40.

1237
01:55:04,647 --> 01:55:06,000
1 30.

1238
01:55:09,207 --> 01:55:11,323
What the hell? I'm going to stall!

1239
01:55:14,367 --> 01:55:15,402
I'm stalling!

1240
01:55:17,927 --> 01:55:19,121
Power!
Power up!

1241
01:55:22,727 --> 01:55:23,842
1 40.

1242
01:55:25,887 --> 01:55:26,797
There we go.

1243
01:55:32,887 --> 01:55:34,445
Wait a minute.

1244
01:55:36,767 --> 01:55:37,643
Landing gear!

1245
01:55:52,927 --> 01:55:54,155
Okay, we're going to land.

1246
01:56:06,687 --> 01:56:08,120
Oh, man. We're long.

1247
01:56:09,287 --> 01:56:10,322
What the hell?

1248
01:56:10,567 --> 01:56:11,966
He's way too high.

1249
01:56:14,007 --> 01:56:14,883
Come on!

1250
01:56:15,127 --> 01:56:16,480
I missed! I missed it!

1251
01:56:17,487 --> 01:56:18,966
I missed it. I'm over.

1252
01:56:20,807 --> 01:56:22,081
Power up.

1253
01:56:23,927 --> 01:56:25,360
Won't climb.

1254
01:56:25,647 --> 01:56:27,683
Come on, baby. Come on.

1255
01:56:36,607 --> 01:56:37,517
Gear up!

1256
01:56:42,567 --> 01:56:43,795
Now what do I do?

1257
01:56:44,487 --> 01:56:46,125
Turn around for another approach.

1258
01:56:46,367 --> 01:56:47,720
I can't turn it around.

1259
01:56:48,287 --> 01:56:49,117
Yes, you can!

1260
01:56:49,407 --> 01:56:51,045
No, wait. Wait a minute.

1261
01:56:51,287 --> 01:56:52,436
Let me think.

1262
01:56:52,887 --> 01:56:54,002
Hold it.

1263
01:56:54,247 --> 01:56:55,760
That's the interstate.

1264
01:56:56,167 --> 01:56:59,239
There's the ballpark.
Frederick Field must be ahead.

1265
01:56:59,487 --> 01:57:01,000
I know where I am!

1266
01:57:01,247 --> 01:57:03,158
I can do this. All right.

1267
01:57:03,727 --> 01:57:04,682
Line it up. . .

1268
01:57:04,967 --> 01:57:05,922
. . .for 2-6.

1269
01:57:07,167 --> 01:57:09,476
There it is. There it is!

1270
01:57:10,407 --> 01:57:12,045
Reduce power.

1271
01:57:18,447 --> 01:57:19,596
Here we go.

1272
01:57:19,847 --> 01:57:20,996
Power back.

1273
01:57:22,527 --> 01:57:24,404
Shit. Landing gear. . .

1274
01:57:25,887 --> 01:57:27,161
. . .down.

1275
01:57:28,407 --> 01:57:29,681
Airspeed. . .

1276
01:57:29,927 --> 01:57:31,519
. . . 1 40 knots.

1277
01:57:32,967 --> 01:57:34,002
Think.

1278
01:57:34,247 --> 01:57:35,396
What am I forgetting?

1279
01:57:35,647 --> 01:57:37,524
Who cares?
Just fly the plane!

1280
01:57:39,767 --> 01:57:41,246
You're right.

1281
01:57:41,647 --> 01:57:43,000
All right, I can do this.

1282
01:57:45,407 --> 01:57:47,204
"Fly the plane. "

1283
01:57:48,527 --> 01:57:49,846
I can do this.

1284
01:57:50,087 --> 01:57:51,964
I can do this.

1285
01:58:18,447 --> 01:58:19,596
Jesus, I'm down!

1286
01:58:42,567 --> 01:58:44,603
Shit. Hold on!

1287
02:00:05,887 --> 02:00:08,321
Things almost land themselves,
don't they?

1288
02:00:36,607 --> 02:00:39,246
I don't know how you did it,
but you did it.

1289
02:00:40,087 --> 02:00:41,361
No, you did it.

1290
02:00:44,807 --> 02:00:46,286
What do you mean?
What is this?

1291
02:00:46,527 --> 02:00:47,642
A little memento for you.

1292
02:00:47,887 --> 02:00:50,481
I'll tell you about it another time.
Right now. . .

1293
02:00:50,727 --> 02:00:53,480
. . .I need a drink. A big drink.

1294
02:00:59,847 --> 02:01:01,166
Marshal?

1295
02:01:01,447 --> 02:01:02,516
How you doing?

1296
02:01:02,767 --> 02:01:05,201
Getting better by the minute.

1297
02:01:05,527 --> 02:01:07,563
Where'd these commandos come from?

1298
02:01:08,687 --> 02:01:09,881
Good question.

1299
02:01:17,767 --> 02:01:19,120
You'll be okay.

1300
02:01:19,367 --> 02:01:20,277
Hold it.

1301
02:01:22,607 --> 02:01:23,835
Hey, guys.

1302
02:01:56,687 --> 02:01:57,517
It's Jean.

1303
02:01:58,807 --> 02:02:00,081
