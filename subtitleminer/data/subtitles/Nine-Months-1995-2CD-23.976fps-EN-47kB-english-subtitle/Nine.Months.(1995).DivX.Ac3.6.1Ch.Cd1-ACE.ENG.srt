1
00:01:35,499 --> 00:01:36,917
All right.

2
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:38,919
Toast time.

3
00:01:38,961 --> 00:01:40,408
All right.

4
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:43,582
Um, this is,
amazingly enough, to us.

5
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:49,789
Five incredible,
incredible years.

6
00:01:52,667 --> 00:01:53,960
Cheers.

7
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:58,373
Come here.

8
00:02:06,456 --> 00:02:10,460
Brendan, we're leaving
in five minutes, sweetie.

9
00:02:30,498 --> 00:02:31,749
Samuel.

10
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:32,917
Yeah?

11
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,377
Do you want more?

12
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,662
No, thanks.
No. I've had lots.

13
00:02:36,746 --> 00:02:38,164
No. Not lunch.

14
00:02:38,206 --> 00:02:40,416
I mean
more for us.

15
00:02:44,325 --> 00:02:47,249
By which you mean
the big '' M''--

16
00:02:47,332 --> 00:02:48,750
Marriage, huh?

17
00:02:48,834 --> 00:02:50,335
Well...yeah.

18
00:02:50,419 --> 00:02:52,913
Um, I'm over 30,

19
00:02:52,996 --> 00:02:56,500
and I feel like
something's missing.

20
00:02:56,542 --> 00:02:58,419
O.K. Well,
you know, what?

21
00:02:58,502 --> 00:03:00,450
What could possibly
be missing?

22
00:03:00,534 --> 00:03:03,207
Let's look at that,
because, you know,

23
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:05,418
we live in
a fantastic apartment.

24
00:03:05,501 --> 00:03:07,908
My practice
is really good.

25
00:03:07,991 --> 00:03:11,249
We get on better
than most married couples.

26
00:03:11,332 --> 00:03:12,542
Sure.

27
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:15,578
Life is dangerously close
to perfection actually,

28
00:03:15,658 --> 00:03:19,541
so, uh, why would you
want to change things?

29
00:03:19,582 --> 00:03:22,419
Why change
what's perfect?

30
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,866
Yeah?

31
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,414
Right.

32
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,667
O.K.

33
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:36,083
Uh, new toast.
To stability.

34
00:03:37,334 --> 00:03:38,669
Honey!

35
00:03:40,117 --> 00:03:41,956
Oh, God!

36
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:44,792
Shit, honey.
I hit a guy. Come on!

37
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:46,293
Are you all right?

38
00:03:46,377 --> 00:03:49,622
Excuse me, ma'am.
I know CPR.

39
00:03:49,706 --> 00:03:52,208
Aah...

40
00:03:56,955 --> 00:03:58,248
O.K.

41
00:04:03,455 --> 00:04:06,623
You're conscious! I thought
you were French kissing.

42
00:04:06,707 --> 00:04:08,917
I was trying to scream.

43
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,085
Don't get up.

44
00:04:10,127 --> 00:04:11,374
He's all right.

45
00:04:11,455 --> 00:04:14,081
It's under control,
madam. Thank you.

46
00:04:14,164 --> 00:04:15,582
Does your head hurt?

47
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:16,583
Yes.

48
00:04:16,667 --> 00:04:17,668
Are you nauseated?

49
00:04:17,751 --> 00:04:18,669
Very.

50
00:04:18,752 --> 00:04:20,663
Open your eyes!
Wide! Wide!

51
00:04:20,746 --> 00:04:22,748
Aah!

52
00:04:22,832 --> 00:04:24,250
Your pupils
aren't dilated.

53
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:25,918
You're O.K.
I brought you back!

54
00:04:26,002 --> 00:04:27,700
He's O.K. Let him up.

55
00:04:27,783 --> 00:04:29,706
All right.
Whoa. Sorry, buddy.

56
00:04:29,789 --> 00:04:31,082
No. Careful.

57
00:04:31,165 --> 00:04:32,667
No lawsuit.

58
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,168
Good. No lawsuit.

59
00:04:34,252 --> 00:04:36,117
Yeah. Marty Dwyer.

60
00:04:36,158 --> 00:04:37,998
Yeah.
Samuel Faulkner.

61
00:04:38,081 --> 00:04:40,667
How you doing?
Good to meet you.

62
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,658
A big wind
came along and bam!

63
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:45,414
Cracked you
on the noggin,

64
00:04:45,497 --> 00:04:46,957
but I guess
you know that.

65
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,002
Kids, stop that!
Your manners.

66
00:04:50,085 --> 00:04:51,992
There's plenty.
Help yourselves.

67
00:04:52,033 --> 00:04:54,790
This sucks.
It tastes like poo!

68
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:57,584
Oh, bloody hell.

69
00:04:57,668 --> 00:05:00,621
What did I say about spitting
in people's food?

70
00:05:02,123 --> 00:05:04,542
Oh, please.
Here, eat this.

71
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:06,043
Eat that, honey.

72
00:05:06,127 --> 00:05:07,825
You know, I know you.

73
00:05:07,866 --> 00:05:09,247
I don't think so.

74
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:12,875
You're Sean's friend,
the kiddie, you know,

75
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:14,460
shrink.

76
00:05:14,544 --> 00:05:15,950
Yes. I'm a psychotherapist.

77
00:05:16,033 --> 00:05:17,914
Like some help
with your children?

78
00:05:17,998 --> 00:05:20,542
I met you last year
at Sean's loft.

79
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:22,168
I'm his sister Gail.

80
00:05:22,252 --> 00:05:23,658
Oh, hi.
I'm Rebecca.

81
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:25,664
Nice to see you again.

82
00:05:25,747 --> 00:05:27,165
Look, I'm sorry.
That's beluga.

83
00:05:27,249 --> 00:05:29,918
It's $64 an ounce.
It's not dog food.

84
00:05:30,002 --> 00:05:31,413
I'll write you a check.

85
00:05:31,494 --> 00:05:33,080
No, it's fine.
It's just...

86
00:05:33,163 --> 00:05:34,123
O.K.

87
00:05:34,206 --> 00:05:36,584
Kids,
say thank you to the man

88
00:05:36,667 --> 00:05:38,085
for the nice cheese

89
00:05:38,168 --> 00:05:40,871
and give him
a big hug!

90
00:05:40,913 --> 00:05:42,415
Thank you!

91
00:05:42,498 --> 00:05:43,916
Pleasure.

92
00:05:47,003 --> 00:05:49,706
Kids, break it up.
We got stuff to do.

93
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:54,836
Have a little bit.
Just a bit.

94
00:05:54,919 --> 00:05:56,325
No. Come on.

95
00:05:56,409 --> 00:05:58,290
Come on, Sprinkler.
Let's go.

96
00:05:58,373 --> 00:06:00,542
Hope we didn't ruin
your picnic.

97
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:02,711
No. Why would you
think that?

98
00:06:02,794 --> 00:06:05,038
Take it easy.
See you around.

99
00:06:05,122 --> 00:06:06,039
Bye.

100
00:06:06,123 --> 00:06:07,916
You see--breeders,

101
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:10,919
perfect example
of the product of change.

102
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:40,959
The swelling's
gone down.

103
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:43,451
It's still quite painful, actually.

104
00:06:43,493 --> 00:06:45,455
You know,
all I'm saying

105
00:06:45,497 --> 00:06:48,959
is there should be
two areas on the beach,

106
00:06:49,001 --> 00:06:51,950
one for adults
and one for children.

107
00:06:51,992 --> 00:06:53,455
Then everyone's happy.

108
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:54,957
Is that any better?

109
00:06:54,999 --> 00:06:56,458
Yeah.

110
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:58,878
That's much better.

111
00:06:58,961 --> 00:07:01,539
You're
too tense.

112
00:07:03,457 --> 00:07:05,376
You need to
loosen up.

113
00:07:07,451 --> 00:07:08,913
Come on.

114
00:07:11,332 --> 00:07:16,410
There is no past,
there's only future

115
00:07:16,495 --> 00:07:21,751
There's only here,
there's only now

116
00:07:23,328 --> 00:07:29,418
Oh, your smiling face,
your gracious presence

117
00:07:29,501 --> 00:07:31,410
I love you.

118
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:33,414
I adore you.

119
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:40,580
These are the days
by the sparkling river

120
00:07:42,665 --> 00:07:46,461
His timely grace
and our treasured faith

121
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:54,461
This is a love,
the one magician

122
00:07:54,544 --> 00:07:59,541
Turned the water
into wine

123
00:07:59,624 --> 00:08:00,876
Oh, yeah.

124
00:08:15,332 --> 00:08:18,627
My dad's an asshole.

125
00:08:20,663 --> 00:08:22,123
O.K.

126
00:08:22,165 --> 00:08:23,624
Good.

127
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:25,126
Interesting.

128
00:08:25,168 --> 00:08:27,122
Um, is that
something

129
00:08:27,164 --> 00:08:29,122
you can maybe
elaborate on

130
00:08:29,164 --> 00:08:31,875
a little bit
for me, Truman?

131
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:33,752
O.K.

132
00:08:33,793 --> 00:08:35,451
Great.

133
00:08:36,997 --> 00:08:39,499
My dad's
a giant asshole!

134
00:08:41,334 --> 00:08:42,294
Yeah.

135
00:09:06,252 --> 00:09:07,658
1 , 2.

136
00:09:10,248 --> 00:09:12,584
1 , 2.

137
00:09:14,002 --> 00:09:16,913
O.K. When you
bring your arms up,

138
00:09:16,997 --> 00:09:18,915
round like this,
O.K., Eleanor?

139
00:09:18,999 --> 00:09:20,208
Round. Round.

140
00:09:20,292 --> 00:09:22,998
There you go.
Yeah. O.K.

141
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,913
Like this,
Miss Rebecca?

142
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:26,331
Look. Look at that.

143
00:09:48,034 --> 00:09:49,956
I don't know
about Truman.

144
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,459
I'll get him
to open up,

145
00:09:52,542 --> 00:09:54,956
but he's got very
severe problems,

146
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:58,040
and we know who
to thank, don't we?

147
00:09:58,123 --> 00:09:59,041
Huh?

148
00:09:59,124 --> 00:10:01,293
You know,
his parents.

149
00:10:01,376 --> 00:10:02,294
3 2.

150
00:10:02,377 --> 00:10:04,788
The state
requires you

151
00:10:04,872 --> 00:10:08,334
to take a written test
to drive a car,

152
00:10:08,417 --> 00:10:11,327
but any moron
can become a parent

153
00:10:11,409 --> 00:10:14,373
and just destroy
a child's life.

154
00:10:14,415 --> 00:10:17,376
It's like people
have babies on a whim.

155
00:10:17,418 --> 00:10:20,200
Surely, to be a parent
you have to plan ahead.

156
00:10:20,243 --> 00:10:21,831
36.

157
00:10:21,956 --> 00:10:24,125
Say, do I want to
become a parent?

158
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,835
38.

159
00:10:25,918 --> 00:10:27,121
Am I ready?

160
00:10:27,202 --> 00:10:29,039
I'm pregnant.

161
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,666
What?

162
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,293
Pregnant?

163
00:10:35,658 --> 00:10:36,705
Watch out!

164
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:41,001
Watch out!

165
00:10:41,084 --> 00:10:42,502
Aah!

166
00:10:44,622 --> 00:10:45,623
Watch out!

167
00:10:53,414 --> 00:10:56,375
Well, I guess you
don't want the baby.

168
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:11,458
Sir, your car will be
ready in a minute.

169
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:12,959
You're lucky

170
00:11:13,043 --> 00:11:14,955
the engine's
in the back.

171
00:11:15,038 --> 00:11:16,455
Yeah. Right.

172
00:11:21,084 --> 00:11:22,501
Hi.

173
00:11:22,584 --> 00:11:24,496
Ready in a minute.

174
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,998
Good.

175
00:11:26,081 --> 00:11:28,000
So, um...

176
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:31,491
we are absolutely certain
about this, right?

177
00:11:31,576 --> 00:11:33,998
Well, my period's
1 0 days late.

178
00:11:34,081 --> 00:11:35,166
Right.

179
00:11:35,249 --> 00:11:38,666
And there's no way
you could have had it

180
00:11:38,749 --> 00:11:40,117
and just not noticed?

181
00:11:40,201 --> 00:11:44,000
Sorry. Ridiculous.
That was stupid. Stupid.

182
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:46,501
Could you be a little
more positive about this,

183
00:11:46,584 --> 00:11:48,496
more supportive?

184
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,248
I'm trying to
be positive.

185
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:54,169
Killing us in a head-on
collision is not positive.

186
00:11:54,252 --> 00:11:56,034
It must have been shock.

187
00:11:56,117 --> 00:11:58,624
Out of the blue,
you say you're pregnant.

188
00:11:58,707 --> 00:12:01,168
It was just
a little bit unexpected

189
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:03,659
was probably the reason
for the crash.

190
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,165
I thought you were
using birth control.

191
00:12:06,248 --> 00:12:07,166
I was.

192
00:12:07,249 --> 00:12:09,376
Your car's ready now,
sir.

193
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,665
Great.

194
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:16,667
Oh...

195
00:12:16,709 --> 00:12:18,665
you don't believe me!

196
00:12:18,707 --> 00:12:19,992
No?

197
00:12:20,034 --> 00:12:23,041
You think I got pregnant
behind your back.

198
00:12:23,124 --> 00:12:25,460
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no.

199
00:12:25,543 --> 00:12:26,996
Do you think
I planned this?

200
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:30,040
I'm as flipped out
as you are.

201
00:12:30,081 --> 00:12:31,541
I suppose
I just thought

202
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,043
that birth control

203
00:12:33,084 --> 00:12:36,370
had a little teeny element
of control about it.

204
00:12:36,413 --> 00:12:39,374
Thought it was supposed
to be foolproof.

205
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:41,543
Nothing is foolproof.
It's only 97% effective.

206
00:12:41,585 --> 00:12:43,078
It says so on the box.

207
00:12:43,161 --> 00:12:45,039
Yeah. Right.
97% effective.

208
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,541
So 3% completely
bloody ineffective.

209
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:50,748
They should put that
on the box.

210
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,244
Here you are.

211
00:12:52,329 --> 00:12:53,331
Thanks.

212
00:12:53,414 --> 00:12:54,457
We're off.

213
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:05,627
Hey. Hey.

214
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:07,243
Sean.

215
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,998
Who's the blonde?

216
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:11,541
No idea.

217
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:14,500
Oh, my God.
Jesus.

218
00:13:14,582 --> 00:13:16,497
Hey,
how are you?

219
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,498
Hi.

220
00:13:17,581 --> 00:13:19,500
Hey,
this is Bobbie.

221
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:20,501
Hi.

222
00:13:20,584 --> 00:13:22,500
This is Rebecca
and Sam.

223
00:13:22,582 --> 00:13:23,492
Hi.

224
00:13:23,575 --> 00:13:26,499
I was getting worried
about you guys.

225
00:13:26,582 --> 00:13:28,501
What happened
to this car?

226
00:13:28,584 --> 00:13:30,002
Oh, long story.

227
00:13:30,085 --> 00:13:31,992
What happened to Christine?

228
00:13:32,076 --> 00:13:33,831
A long story.

229
00:13:37,084 --> 00:13:40,997
So this is where
you two are going to stay.

230
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,040
Yeah, lovely.

231
00:13:42,123 --> 00:13:45,043
So, what do you
think of her?

232
00:13:45,126 --> 00:13:47,036
What,
you mean the blonde?

233
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:48,538
She's attractive.
Very attractive.

234
00:13:48,622 --> 00:13:50,540
She's 25 years old.

235
00:13:50,624 --> 00:13:54,044
Her skin
is like ribbon candy.

236
00:13:54,127 --> 00:13:56,997
Breasts
like sponge cake.

237
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:58,999
Her calves
are like calzone.

238
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:00,959
I mean,
highly edible.

239
00:14:01,043 --> 00:14:02,458
Highly edible.

240
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,497
She's crazy
about sex.

241
00:14:04,538 --> 00:14:05,998
This is somebody

242
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,501
to get me over
the rough spots.

243
00:14:08,542 --> 00:14:11,950
Mmm. What do you mean?
What rough spots?

244
00:14:12,035 --> 00:14:13,998
Oh, Christine
left me.

245
00:14:16,542 --> 00:14:18,044
Oh, shit.

246
00:14:18,086 --> 00:14:19,492
When?

247
00:14:19,575 --> 00:14:21,498
Oh, uh...
a week ago.

248
00:14:21,581 --> 00:14:22,999
What happened?

249
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:24,667
Well...

250
00:14:26,086 --> 00:14:27,533
she wanted
a child.

251
00:14:29,081 --> 00:14:30,499
I'm sorry.

252
00:14:30,582 --> 00:14:32,000
Are you O.K.?

253
00:14:32,084 --> 00:14:34,168
Yep. Yep.
What an idiot.

254
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:35,658
Leave that.

255
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,164
Got it.

256
00:14:37,206 --> 00:14:38,874
She said she wanted--

257
00:14:38,957 --> 00:14:41,668
She, uh...
Christine wanted a baby.

258
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,658
She was hungry
for seed,

259
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:46,165
so I closed
the iron door,

260
00:14:46,207 --> 00:14:48,042
denied her
my essence.

261
00:14:48,084 --> 00:14:51,201
You know,
I'm not ready

262
00:14:51,284 --> 00:14:53,039
to be biologically
extraneous.

263
00:14:53,122 --> 00:14:55,083
She would have
devoured me

264
00:14:55,124 --> 00:14:56,918
from the head down,

265
00:14:57,001 --> 00:14:58,375
chewed up
my manhood,

266
00:14:58,415 --> 00:15:01,373
swallowed my youth,
and gobbled me up

267
00:15:01,414 --> 00:15:03,083
like some
praying mantis.

268
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:04,584
Not for me.

269
00:15:04,667 --> 00:15:07,036
What do you mean,
praying mantis?

270
00:15:07,077 --> 00:15:08,538
The female mantis,

271
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,999
after she has sex
with her mate,

272
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:12,501
she eats him.

273
00:15:12,584 --> 00:15:14,002
Oh, yeah.

274
00:15:14,085 --> 00:15:16,497
But Christine
wasn't pregnant

275
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,832
or anything
like that?

276
00:15:20,084 --> 00:15:23,367
No. What do you mean?
Like on the sly?

277
00:15:23,408 --> 00:15:24,872
On the sly,

278
00:15:24,914 --> 00:15:27,875
or, you know,
in the run of things.

279
00:15:27,917 --> 00:15:30,167
On the s-- No.

280
00:15:30,249 --> 00:15:33,539
I mean, Christine
has her faults,

281
00:15:33,623 --> 00:15:37,085
but I don't know
who would do that.

282
00:15:37,168 --> 00:15:39,575
That's a knife
in the back.

283
00:15:39,659 --> 00:15:40,580
Yeah.

284
00:15:40,664 --> 00:15:42,791
You know, that's--
No, of course not.

285
00:15:42,874 --> 00:15:44,292
That's
some voodoo woman

286
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:46,291
who puts pins
in her diaphragm.

287
00:15:46,374 --> 00:15:47,283
Ha ha.

288
00:15:47,367 --> 00:15:48,288
Spooky, Sam.

289
00:15:48,372 --> 00:15:50,082
That's a she-snake.

290
00:15:50,123 --> 00:15:51,667
That's like
the most hateful,

291
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,377
cruel, sneaky,

292
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,367
horrible thing
you can do.

293
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:56,872
Who would do that?

294
00:16:06,082 --> 00:16:08,292
No! No!

295
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:10,001
Aah!

296
00:16:10,084 --> 00:16:11,450
Aah!

297
00:16:11,492 --> 00:16:14,457
They eat the father!
They eat the father!

298
00:16:14,499 --> 00:16:15,959
They eat him!

299
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,498
Honey. Honey, what?
Honey, what?

300
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,497
Who eats fathers?

301
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:23,500
No one.
Sorry. Sorry.

302
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,502
Just a bad,
bad dream.

303
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:26,994
Silly, silly dream.

304
00:16:27,077 --> 00:16:28,997
O.K.
You worry too much.

305
00:16:29,081 --> 00:16:30,499
Just relax.

306
00:16:30,582 --> 00:16:32,459
Lie down, O.K.
Lie down.

307
00:16:32,501 --> 00:16:34,498
It's O.K., baby.

308
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:38,958
Whatever happens,
we can work it out.

309
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,543
I know.

310
00:16:41,627 --> 00:16:43,035
I love you.

311
00:16:43,118 --> 00:16:44,538
I've loved you

312
00:16:44,622 --> 00:16:47,541
since the first moment
I saw you.

313
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:49,043
You're the only one

314
00:16:49,126 --> 00:16:52,538
I want to be the father
of my children,

315
00:16:52,622 --> 00:16:54,540
whether
it's now or later.

316
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:58,497
O.K.?

317
00:17:06,704 --> 00:17:07,994
Oh...

318
00:17:09,206 --> 00:17:12,167
I love it
when you do that.

319
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:13,669
Do what?

320
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,159
Ha ha ha!

321
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:18,207
That thing you're doing
with my knee.

322
00:17:18,249 --> 00:17:19,708
That is so good.

323
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,210
Oh, Samuel.

324
00:17:21,252 --> 00:17:23,201
Stop it.
I love it.

325
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:25,039
Go on.

326
00:17:25,081 --> 00:17:26,541
But, Samuel?

327
00:17:26,582 --> 00:17:28,042
What? Yeah?

328
00:17:28,084 --> 00:17:31,035
I'm not doing anything
with your knee.

329
00:17:33,581 --> 00:17:34,874
Huh?

330
00:17:36,459 --> 00:17:38,207
Aah! What is it?

331
00:17:39,242 --> 00:17:40,413
Aah!

332
00:17:40,497 --> 00:17:42,207
- Aah!
- Aah!

333
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:44,918
What's the matter?
Come here, kiddo.

334
00:17:45,001 --> 00:17:47,994
Where you been?
Come here, you.

335
00:17:49,915 --> 00:17:53,418
I'm sorry, folks.
Come on. Get away from him.

336
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,911
I'm sorry, folks.

337
00:17:54,952 --> 00:17:57,081
She's going through
a hiding phase.

338
00:17:57,122 --> 00:17:58,874
It's for attention.

339
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:01,377
Hey, honey,
you'll get it dirty,

340
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,994
and God knows
what's on there.

341
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:06,249
Hey, honey,
it's the beach people.

342
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:07,500
Oh, hi.

343
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:12,079
This is great. Don't worry.
We didn't bring a kite.

344
00:18:12,162 --> 00:18:14,415
How about another one
of them kisses?

345
00:18:16,584 --> 00:18:18,538
What's going on?

346
00:18:18,621 --> 00:18:20,120
We found her.

347
00:18:20,162 --> 00:18:23,124
We've been looking
for her for an hour.

348
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:26,248
Honey, tell the neighbors
to call off the search.

349
00:18:26,289 --> 00:18:29,039
You, call the sheriff
before the choppers go up.

350
00:18:29,122 --> 00:18:31,667
We're sorry.
Looks like a full house.

351
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,460
Party time, then!

352
00:18:33,502 --> 00:18:34,911
I'm sorry.
Get back in there.

353
00:18:34,952 --> 00:18:38,833
Listen, um, sorry,
and I'm going to take off.

354
00:18:38,874 --> 00:18:40,626
You'll be here all weekend,
right?

355
00:18:40,709 --> 00:18:42,703
Sounds great.
Good to see you.

356
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,585
You didn't tell me
they were coming.

357
00:18:49,668 --> 00:18:51,617
They didn't
tell me either.

358
00:18:51,659 --> 00:18:54,332
They always
show up uninvited.

359
00:18:54,415 --> 00:18:56,751
I hope they don't
spoil your weekend.

360
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:58,330
Oh, no.

361
00:18:58,413 --> 00:19:00,121
We'll be fine.
The kids seem adorable.

362
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:01,915
Oh,
they're monsters.

363
00:19:01,998 --> 00:19:04,000
They're monsters.

364
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:06,869
See, this is why
I don't want kids.

365
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:11,333
It's nonsense.

366
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:26,707
No, what I'm saying is

367
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:30,206
I think it's such baloney
and such a cliche

368
00:19:30,288 --> 00:19:33,206
that the artist
has to be messed up

369
00:19:33,289 --> 00:19:35,792
and have a life
of deprivation,

370
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:38,868
be an alcoholic
or deprived in some way.

371
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:42,040
It's how you use, obviously,
with imagination and passion

372
00:19:42,124 --> 00:19:43,500
whatever it is...

373
00:19:43,542 --> 00:19:46,082
I love you.

374
00:19:46,164 --> 00:19:48,580
Well, that's nice.

375
00:19:48,622 --> 00:19:50,916
I think
you're great.

376
00:19:52,459 --> 00:19:54,496
Marry me,
Captain Renaldo.

377
00:19:57,456 --> 00:19:58,916
Who's
Captain Renaldo?

378
00:20:00,251 --> 00:20:02,702
Marry me.
Make me your wife.

379
00:20:02,744 --> 00:20:04,705
We'll honeymoon
in Paris.

380
00:20:04,747 --> 00:20:06,541
Well, I'm not sure.

381
00:20:06,624 --> 00:20:09,460
It's King Stanislaus'
daughter, isn't it?

382
00:20:09,543 --> 00:20:11,200
You're madly
in love with her!

383
00:20:11,242 --> 00:20:12,205
Who?

384
00:20:12,247 --> 00:20:15,333
Don't deny it!
I saw you two kissing!

385
00:20:15,417 --> 00:20:16,584
Brute!

386
00:20:16,626 --> 00:20:18,828
She hit me.

387
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:21,415
Shannon,
no hitting.

388
00:20:21,498 --> 00:20:23,250
O.K. You run along.

389
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:25,210
Go play.
We'll talk later.

390
00:20:25,293 --> 00:20:27,076
You weasel!

391
00:20:27,118 --> 00:20:30,541
Oh, God.
I am so sorry about that.

392
00:20:30,624 --> 00:20:33,043
She's been reading
Harlequin Romance novels,

393
00:20:33,085 --> 00:20:35,242
and she's just
obsessed with it.

394
00:20:35,283 --> 00:20:37,081
It's kind of cute.

395
00:20:37,123 --> 00:20:38,582
Isn't it cute?
Lovely.

396
00:20:38,624 --> 00:20:40,751
Not many teeth left,
but cute.

397
00:20:40,835 --> 00:20:42,578
What a puss.

398
00:20:48,626 --> 00:20:51,450
All right, everybody.
I've got an announcement.

399
00:20:51,534 --> 00:20:55,583
Gail and I
are going to have a new baby.

400
00:20:57,127 --> 00:21:00,872
Oh, shit. Not another one.

401
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:06,413
So I'd like to
make a toast.

402
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:13,459
To my wife, the most beautiful
pregnant woman in the world.

403
00:21:13,542 --> 00:21:14,868
Love you.

404
00:21:14,951 --> 00:21:16,163
Hear, hear!

405
00:21:16,247 --> 00:21:18,165
You could be
the toughest guy,

406
00:21:18,249 --> 00:21:20,710
but when your child
looks into your eyes

407
00:21:20,793 --> 00:21:22,703
and that child knows
you're their dad...

408
00:21:22,786 --> 00:21:24,205
suddenly
it smiles.

409
00:21:24,288 --> 00:21:26,749
It's like...
I cannot explain it.

410
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:28,251
It's like magic.

411
00:21:28,334 --> 00:21:32,247
Is it magic when they do
that little dribble of vomit

412
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:33,790
down your shoulder?

413
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:40,414
I'm sorry
if we're boring you, pal.

414
00:21:40,497 --> 00:21:41,999
Just a joke.

415
00:21:42,082 --> 00:21:43,542
O.K.
Just forget it.

416
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:44,876
The guy is rude.

417
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,827
Sorry.
What did you say?

418
00:21:46,868 --> 00:21:48,872
You are rude.

419
00:21:48,956 --> 00:21:51,041
Rude?
You think I'm rude?

420
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:52,376
Yes, I do.

421
00:21:52,459 --> 00:21:54,868
I'm sorry--
It's all right, honey.

422
00:21:54,951 --> 00:21:57,331
Let's just deal
with this accusation.

423
00:21:57,373 --> 00:21:59,375
Like an idiot,
I was under the impression

424
00:21:59,417 --> 00:22:01,002
you were monopolizing
the conversation.

425
00:22:01,043 --> 00:22:03,996
I'm sorry
if I'm a little excited

426
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:06,207
about my wife and I
having another baby.

427
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:07,750
Is being excited a reason

428
00:22:07,792 --> 00:22:09,749
to exclude eight people
from conversation?

429
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:11,242
I didn't realize

430
00:22:11,284 --> 00:22:13,081
this was a frickin'
group therapy session!

431
00:22:13,164 --> 00:22:14,499
How much do I owe?

432
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,708
You didn't realize
you were a crashing bore.

433
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:21,540
I'll walk over there
and kick your bony little ass!

434
00:22:21,582 --> 00:22:23,584
I'll have
my 5-year-old daughter do it!

435
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:24,918
Let's drop it.

436
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,868
Marty, he does
have a point,

437
00:22:26,951 --> 00:22:28,289
but just drop it.

438
00:22:28,372 --> 00:22:29,748
Sean, he's a dick,

439
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:31,875
and you're an even bigger dick

440
00:22:31,959 --> 00:22:34,039
for taking his side
over family.

441
00:22:34,122 --> 00:22:37,123
You and Gail used to
be interested

442
00:22:37,164 --> 00:22:38,624
in politics,
music, art.

443
00:22:38,666 --> 00:22:40,751
Now it's nothing but
kids, kids, kids.

444
00:22:40,835 --> 00:22:43,075
My kids are
very meaningful to me.

445
00:22:43,158 --> 00:22:44,622
When my first was born,

446
00:22:44,664 --> 00:22:47,125
it was my most
exciting moment.

447
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:49,748
I felt like I really
made a contribution

448
00:22:49,832 --> 00:22:51,284
to this world.

449
00:22:51,325 --> 00:22:52,581
Absolutely.
Congratulations.

450
00:22:52,664 --> 00:22:54,124
The world
is overpopulated.

451
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:56,126
Our society has too many
starving children.

452
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:58,038
I would say our society

453
00:22:58,122 --> 00:23:00,205
has too many
starving artists.

454
00:23:02,624 --> 00:23:04,042
It hasn't been
lucrative.

455
00:23:04,126 --> 00:23:05,043
That's true,

456
00:23:05,127 --> 00:23:06,536
but that
doesn't mean

457
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:08,037
what I do
isn't respectable.

458
00:23:08,122 --> 00:23:10,040
Van Gogh,
while he was living,

459
00:23:10,082 --> 00:23:11,542
didn't sell
one painting.

460
00:23:11,584 --> 00:23:13,956
Now his stuff goes
for $40 million.

461
00:23:13,998 --> 00:23:16,581
How long will you
have to be dead

462
00:23:16,664 --> 00:23:19,083
before you can pay
that phone bill?

463
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:22,080
Do you come here
to ruin my weekends

464
00:23:22,163 --> 00:23:24,414
and embarrass me
at my home?

465
00:23:24,497 --> 00:23:26,791
Your home?
This isn't your home.

466
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:28,585
It was our parents' home!

467
00:23:28,668 --> 00:23:30,453
You aren't making
any contributions.

468
00:23:30,536 --> 00:23:32,873
You've got no wife,
no kids.

469
00:23:32,956 --> 00:23:34,583
You insult your
only family.

470
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:37,085
You keep this up,
you'll die alone,

471
00:23:37,168 --> 00:23:39,075
like a dog,
like a bum,

472
00:23:39,159 --> 00:23:40,581
like Van Gogh.

473
00:23:55,535 --> 00:23:57,957
Hey, Doc,
you all right?

474
00:23:59,625 --> 00:24:01,043
Are you O.K.?

475
00:24:02,453 --> 00:24:03,871
Yeah. What?

476
00:24:03,954 --> 00:24:05,373
You don't look good.

477
00:24:05,456 --> 00:24:07,792
You look like
you're going to puke.

478
00:24:07,876 --> 00:24:10,288
No, I'm fine.
Thank you, Truman.

479
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:13,790
I was just listening
to what you were saying.

480
00:24:13,832 --> 00:24:16,293
Interesting.
That was a key sentence.

481
00:24:16,376 --> 00:24:18,288
Would you mind
repeating it

482
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:21,331
just so
I can get it down?

483
00:24:21,373 --> 00:24:23,292
You're an asshole.

484
00:24:23,333 --> 00:24:25,084
Right.

485
00:24:26,204 --> 00:24:28,414
And Dad's a bastard!

486
00:24:28,497 --> 00:24:30,249
Yeah.

487
00:24:33,168 --> 00:24:34,246
Right.

488
00:24:38,166 --> 00:24:40,877
I can't be a father.

489
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,581
I can't.
I ca...I...I...

490
00:24:44,664 --> 00:24:47,584
Why would I want to
have a child?

491
00:24:47,667 --> 00:24:52,581
Just so he can call me a bastard
in 1 0 years' time?

492
00:24:52,664 --> 00:24:54,583
We'd have to move out.

493
00:24:54,666 --> 00:24:58,121
We don't have space
for a child.

494
00:24:58,204 --> 00:25:00,664
Rebecca and me,
we're wonderful together.

495
00:25:00,748 --> 00:25:03,167
It's just insane
to spoil it.

496
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:07,159
Just the two of us--
That's how it should be.

497
00:25:07,242 --> 00:25:10,166
This baby is not
a good idea.

498
00:25:10,249 --> 00:25:12,460
That's what I'll tell her.

499
00:25:12,543 --> 00:25:13,458
Beck.

500
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,909
Hi.
Be right there.

501
00:25:14,951 --> 00:25:17,999
Just stay back. Bye-bye.

502
00:25:18,082 --> 00:25:19,500
I'll tell her now.

503
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:20,501
Hi.

504
00:25:20,585 --> 00:25:21,706
Beck.

505
00:25:23,786 --> 00:25:24,748
Listen, Beck--

506
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:26,249
Samuel,
I've been thinking--

507
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:27,250
No. Wait.

508
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:29,748
Wait. This pregnancy
was an accident.

509
00:25:29,789 --> 00:25:32,247
It took us
completely by surprise.

510
00:25:32,289 --> 00:25:33,290
Right.

511
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:35,792
We've been doing
really great together,

512
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:38,287
and a baby
would change everything.

513
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:39,786
I suppose it could.

514
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:42,791
Our apartment's
not ready for a baby.

515
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:43,792
No.

516
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:45,291
We'd have to
redecorate.

517
00:25:45,332 --> 00:25:46,287
Yep.

518
00:25:46,328 --> 00:25:48,789
I'd have to
quit my job.

519
00:25:48,831 --> 00:25:51,292
Nobody wants
a pregnant dance teacher.

520
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:53,789
We're not ready
for a child.

521
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:57,290
There's not one good reason
to keep this baby.

522
00:26:00,168 --> 00:26:03,242
But I still want to.

523
00:26:06,124 --> 00:26:07,834
Right.

524
00:26:07,917 --> 00:26:09,332
Maybe it's crazy,

525
00:26:09,415 --> 00:26:12,372
but I feel it
living inside me.

526
00:26:12,456 --> 00:26:13,373
Oh...

527
00:26:13,457 --> 00:26:15,917
and I really
want this baby.

528
00:26:19,159 --> 00:26:20,581
O.K.

529
00:26:20,664 --> 00:26:22,583
What about you?

530
00:26:22,666 --> 00:26:23,584
What do...

531
00:26:23,667 --> 00:26:25,581
Oh, you mean
what...what...

532
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:27,703
what do I think?

533
00:26:27,787 --> 00:26:30,207
I'm just saying
how I feel.

534
00:26:30,291 --> 00:26:32,043
So, um,
what do you feel?

535
00:26:32,126 --> 00:26:35,578
Right. How do I
feel on that one?

536
00:26:35,661 --> 00:26:37,248
Well, um...

537
00:26:39,083 --> 00:26:40,751
I feel, um...

538
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:44,414
I, uh...

539
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:52,164
I feel exactly
the same as you.

540
00:26:54,207 --> 00:26:56,043
Really?

541
00:26:56,126 --> 00:26:57,373
Yeah.

542
00:27:03,625 --> 00:27:05,623
We won't let it
change us.

543
00:27:05,706 --> 00:27:06,909
No.

544
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:09,040
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh.

545
00:27:09,123 --> 00:27:11,584
I have to go
to the bathroom again.

546
00:27:11,626 --> 00:27:13,996
It's one of the joys
of pregnancy.

547
00:27:16,122 --> 00:27:17,582
O.K. Oh, gosh.

548
00:27:17,665 --> 00:27:20,168
We're going to
have a baby.

549
00:27:23,661 --> 00:27:26,625
Aw, I'm such a...
I'm such a coward!

550
00:27:26,666 --> 00:27:29,623
Sorry. Forget it.
Nothing to do with you.

551
00:27:43,667 --> 00:27:46,079
Oh, baby,
you were incredible.

552
00:27:46,162 --> 00:27:48,122
Not bad, eh?

553
00:27:48,164 --> 00:27:51,125
That was the single
most satisfying

554
00:27:51,167 --> 00:27:53,747
sexual experience
of my life.

555
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:56,247
Well, I, uh...
aim to please.

556
00:27:59,167 --> 00:28:00,585
I know.

557
00:28:00,667 --> 00:28:03,787
Now it's time
for dinner.

558
00:28:05,665 --> 00:28:06,917
Dinner?

559
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:14,416
Aah!

560
00:28:14,499 --> 00:28:16,917
No!

561
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:21,332
Time to get up.

562
00:28:21,415 --> 00:28:23,918
Today's our first
doctor's appointment.

563
00:28:24,001 --> 00:28:25,705
Today?

564
00:28:25,788 --> 00:28:28,664
I told you about it
two weeks ago...

565
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:32,210
and then last week,
three days ago,

566
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:35,201
and twice, I think,
yesterday.

567
00:28:36,706 --> 00:28:38,625
Sorry, honey.
I completely forgot.

568
00:28:40,709 --> 00:28:42,120
Yeah.

569
00:28:42,204 --> 00:28:43,620
Figures.

570
00:28:43,661 --> 00:28:46,625
I swear I won't
forget next time.

571
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:54,625
Hi.

572
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:55,626
Hi.

573
00:28:55,709 --> 00:28:58,037
I'm Rebecca Taylor
to see Dr. Green.

574
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:01,040
Oh, Dr. Green's
been out with pneumonia.

575
00:29:01,123 --> 00:29:04,210
You can see Dr. Kosevich
or reschedule.

576
00:29:04,293 --> 00:29:06,701
Yes. I think we'll
just reschedule.

577
00:29:06,784 --> 00:29:08,623
We can see
Dr. Kosevich.

578
00:29:08,706 --> 00:29:10,249
Are you sure?

579
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:12,542
Why?
Is there a problem?

580
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:14,078
Oh, no. No.

581
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:17,081
It's just Dr. Kosevich
is new...from Russia.

582
00:29:17,123 --> 00:29:21,913
He's a little nervous,
oh, but very sweet.

583
00:29:21,995 --> 00:29:23,410
Well,
we're already here.

584
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:26,416
We may as well
see Dr. Kosevich.

585
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,293
O.K.

586
00:29:28,376 --> 00:29:29,290
O.K.

587
00:29:48,539 --> 00:29:50,458
Please, sit down.
One moment.

588
00:29:50,541 --> 00:29:52,168
A little family business.

589
00:29:54,203 --> 00:29:56,122
If it's not
one thing,

590
00:29:56,206 --> 00:29:57,624
it's your mother.

591
00:29:57,707 --> 00:29:59,125
Please, please,
sit down.

592
00:29:59,209 --> 00:30:01,123
I'm very sorry.

593
00:30:01,207 --> 00:30:03,075
Oh, hello.

594
00:30:13,165 --> 00:30:15,918
So we hear
you're from Russia.

595
00:30:16,001 --> 00:30:18,410
You have a problem
with it?

596
00:30:18,494 --> 00:30:20,456
I am not a Communist.

597
00:30:20,539 --> 00:30:23,000
I was only briefly
member of party.

598
00:30:23,042 --> 00:30:26,410
It was only for medical reasons.
I was a scientist.

599
00:30:26,494 --> 00:30:28,748
In Russia, I was chief
of obstruction.

600
00:30:28,831 --> 00:30:29,749
Obstruction?

601
00:30:29,832 --> 00:30:31,000
Abstraction?

602
00:30:31,042 --> 00:30:31,918
Abstraction?

603
00:30:32,001 --> 00:30:33,663
Obstetrics,
I think you mean.

604
00:30:33,704 --> 00:30:35,160
That's it.
Obstetrics.

605
00:30:35,202 --> 00:30:36,623
One moment.

606
00:30:36,706 --> 00:30:38,333
Not obstruction,
is obstetrics.

607
00:30:38,416 --> 00:30:41,331
Yes, I was the head
of obstetrics research

608
00:30:41,414 --> 00:30:43,662
at Pasklovansky Hospital
in St. Petersburg.

609
00:30:43,746 --> 00:30:46,333
What brings you
here, then?

610
00:30:46,374 --> 00:30:48,998
I didn't work with people
in Russia.

611
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,452
More the technical side.

612
00:30:50,535 --> 00:30:52,331
No. Animals.

613
00:30:52,414 --> 00:30:53,582
Animals?

614
00:30:53,665 --> 00:30:55,626
Only rats and monkeys.

615
00:30:55,709 --> 00:30:56,666
Rats?

616
00:30:56,749 --> 00:30:58,328
Change of scenery.

617
00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:01,874
You've seen one rat ass,
you've seen them all.

618
00:31:01,916 --> 00:31:05,165
I also want a patient
who won't bite me.

619
00:31:05,247 --> 00:31:07,578
Last month,
I received my new license,

620
00:31:07,662 --> 00:31:09,582
and now
I deliver human babies.

621
00:31:09,665 --> 00:31:12,583
O.K., now,
I have a computer program here

622
00:31:12,666 --> 00:31:14,576
that I have written myself

623
00:31:14,659 --> 00:31:17,582
that will calculate
your due date very accurately.

624
00:31:17,665 --> 00:31:18,917
O.K.?

625
00:31:18,958 --> 00:31:23,202
Fine. When was the first day
of your last menopause?

626
00:31:23,285 --> 00:31:24,623
- Menopause?
- Menstruation.

627
00:31:24,706 --> 00:31:25,665
Menstruation.

628
00:31:25,749 --> 00:31:26,500
Period.

629
00:31:26,583 --> 00:31:28,707
End of sentence.

630
00:31:28,791 --> 00:31:30,369
March 1 1 th.

631
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:31,579
March 1 1 th.

632
00:31:31,662 --> 00:31:33,916
March 1 1 th.

633
00:31:33,957 --> 00:31:35,292
O.K.

634
00:31:36,625 --> 00:31:39,370
Here it comes.

635
00:31:39,453 --> 00:31:42,041
The baby will be due
December 8th.

636
00:31:42,124 --> 00:31:43,834
O.K.

637
00:31:43,918 --> 00:31:47,243
Congratulations. The baby
was conceived March 1 7 th.

638
00:31:47,285 --> 00:31:49,665
Oh, that's clever.

639
00:31:49,749 --> 00:31:51,167
Most people know that,

640
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:54,161
but some people
are too drunk to remember.

641
00:31:54,244 --> 00:31:55,663
Oh, my God.

642
00:31:55,746 --> 00:31:57,082
What is wrong?

643
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,458
I'm not the father.

644
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,538
What?

645
00:32:01,621 --> 00:32:02,743
Oh, my God.

646
00:32:02,785 --> 00:32:05,248
On March 1 7 th,
I was away

647
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:09,413
at a child psychiatry conference
in Boston, remember?

648
00:32:09,497 --> 00:32:11,034
What are you
saying?

649
00:32:11,118 --> 00:32:13,082
I'll leave you two alone.

650
00:32:13,165 --> 00:32:14,124
That's fine.
I'm going.

651
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:16,624
No! Wait!
Come back! Sit down!

652
00:32:16,666 --> 00:32:18,119
Samuel, sit down!

653
00:32:18,161 --> 00:32:19,621
Check your computer
again!

654
00:32:19,663 --> 00:32:22,625
It is--the computer
is very accurate.

655
00:32:22,708 --> 00:32:23,542
Check the goddamn
computer.

656
00:32:23,626 --> 00:32:24,583
Check it!

657
00:32:24,624 --> 00:32:27,118
Don't yell at me!
Please don't do this.

658
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,873
I spent a year
in Afghanistan.

659
00:32:28,956 --> 00:32:31,876
I have sometimes
very low tolerance for pressure.

660
00:32:31,959 --> 00:32:32,915
Come on!

661
00:32:32,998 --> 00:32:35,914
O.K. What is wrong
with the thing?

662
00:32:35,997 --> 00:32:38,416
Oh, fuck me!
It's not working.

663
00:32:40,001 --> 00:32:42,410
Hold on. O.K.
What is wrong?

664
00:32:42,494 --> 00:32:44,331
Oh, O.K. O.K.
Excuse me.

665
00:32:44,373 --> 00:32:46,792
This is the problem.

666
00:32:46,875 --> 00:32:49,663
It is feces
flying into the fan.

667
00:32:49,704 --> 00:32:52,164
There are function keys
for humans and simians,

668
00:32:52,206 --> 00:32:53,707
and you're not a simian.

669
00:32:53,749 --> 00:32:55,167
No, I'm not.

670
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:57,621
I had you as a baboon.

671
00:32:57,704 --> 00:32:59,663
Sorry. I didn't...

672
00:32:59,704 --> 00:33:03,334
There you go.
Were you here March 23rd?

673
00:33:03,417 --> 00:33:04,375
Yeah.

674
00:33:04,416 --> 00:33:05,746
With her?

675
00:33:05,828 --> 00:33:06,992
- Yes.
- Yes.

676
00:33:07,077 --> 00:33:09,540
O.K., um,
everything is fine now.

677
00:33:09,582 --> 00:33:12,500
We're all back on-line,
and your baby...

678
00:33:12,582 --> 00:33:15,830
<i>your</i> baby will be born
on December 1 5th.

679
00:33:15,914 --> 00:33:19,125
O.K. Now it is time
for the physical examination.

680
00:33:19,209 --> 00:33:22,618
Let's take a look
at your Volvo, O.K.?

681
00:33:22,701 --> 00:33:26,416
Come with me into here.
I'll warm my hands for you.

682
00:33:28,209 --> 00:33:29,787
Please come in.

683
00:33:31,704 --> 00:33:33,332
All right, madam.

684
00:33:33,415 --> 00:33:36,707
If you would get undressed,
we'll begin, O.K.?

685
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:39,956
And you may stay,
sir, if you like.

686
00:33:40,039 --> 00:33:41,457
That's fine.
I'll wait--

687
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,959
Don't you dare.

688
00:33:43,042 --> 00:33:44,707
I'd like to
stay.

689
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:47,747
Very good.
Let me get ready for you.

690
00:33:59,167 --> 00:34:00,541
O.K.

691
00:34:00,624 --> 00:34:02,576
We've worked out
all the insects.

692
00:34:03,997 --> 00:34:05,249
Giddyup.

693
00:34:08,666 --> 00:34:10,119
Run.

694
00:34:12,623 --> 00:34:14,583
That lunatic
is not delivering me.

695
00:34:14,667 --> 00:34:16,624
That's fine.
He's just a replacement.

696
00:34:16,665 --> 00:34:18,493
Dr. Green will be there.

697
00:34:18,576 --> 00:34:21,249
Let me help you, honey.
Just be gentle!

698
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:23,251
Honey, listen,
I was thinking,

699
00:34:23,292 --> 00:34:24,748
about the baby--

700
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:27,747
Let's just keep it
to ourselves, huh?

701
00:34:27,789 --> 00:34:29,749
Um, um,
yeah, all right.

702
00:34:29,791 --> 00:34:31,292
Talking about it

703
00:34:31,334 --> 00:34:33,621
before the third month
is bad luck.

704
00:34:33,703 --> 00:34:35,663
Marty, look who's here!

705
00:34:35,704 --> 00:34:37,707
Hey, look who's here!

706
00:34:37,791 --> 00:34:40,166
Hey, guys,
what the hell?

707
00:34:40,208 --> 00:34:42,867
Good to see you!
How you doing?

708
00:34:42,952 --> 00:34:43,872
Hi.

709
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:45,374
When
are you due?

710
00:34:45,457 --> 00:34:46,875
Oh, I'm not
pregnant.

711
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:48,873
You're not pregnant?
Yeah, right.

712
00:34:48,956 --> 00:34:49,870
Huh?

713
00:34:49,953 --> 00:34:51,621
What are you
doing

714
00:34:51,704 --> 00:34:53,541
on the maternity
floor?

715
00:34:53,624 --> 00:34:56,042
Are we on
the maternity floor?

716
00:34:56,124 --> 00:34:57,870
Good grief.
We're completely lost.

717
00:34:57,953 --> 00:34:59,245
Poor old Beck.

718
00:34:59,328 --> 00:35:00,706
She had
some bad Chinese.

719
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:03,459
We're here to see
the gastrointestinal specialist.

720
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:04,706
What's his name?

721
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:06,285
His name?

722
00:35:06,369 --> 00:35:07,621
Yeah.

723
00:35:07,705 --> 00:35:09,624
I can probably
tell you

724
00:35:09,707 --> 00:35:11,125
what floor he's on.

725
00:35:11,167 --> 00:35:13,454
She volunteers here. I've sold
cars to almost every doctor.

726
00:35:13,538 --> 00:35:14,952
Beck, what's his name?

727
00:35:15,035 --> 00:35:16,957
It's Dr. something,
isn't it?

728
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,416
It's Doctor...

729
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,917
Ridiculous.

730
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,412
Excuse me.

731
00:35:21,496 --> 00:35:22,910
Oh, gosh.
Thanks.

732
00:35:22,993 --> 00:35:25,415
I didn't realize
I'd left it.

733
00:35:25,499 --> 00:35:26,917
Thank you
very much.

734
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,997
You have
a small pussy.

735
00:35:29,081 --> 00:35:30,078
What?

736
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:33,165
I found the little hairs
on the bag.

737
00:35:33,249 --> 00:35:34,166
What?

738
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:35,709
You know, the...meow...

739
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:37,538
Oh, cat!

740
00:35:37,579 --> 00:35:39,997
Yes, we have a cat.

741
00:35:40,081 --> 00:35:43,084
Well, you must
get rid of it.

742
00:35:43,126 --> 00:35:44,083
What?

743
00:35:44,125 --> 00:35:45,538
Cats spread the disease.

744
00:35:45,579 --> 00:35:48,039
Oh, yeah. Where
the small worms...

745
00:35:48,081 --> 00:35:49,541
Yes.
Small worms.

746
00:35:49,582 --> 00:35:51,126
In the poop.

747
00:35:51,209 --> 00:35:52,290
Toxoplasmosis.

748
00:35:52,374 --> 00:35:53,787
Toxoplasmosis.
Thank you.

749
00:35:53,869 --> 00:35:55,789
Thank you both
very much,

750
00:35:55,872 --> 00:35:58,250
but Skippy
is old and clean

751
00:35:58,291 --> 00:36:00,249
and won't cause
any problem.

752
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:02,700
O.K. Well,
it is your choice--

753
00:36:02,784 --> 00:36:05,749
the cat or the baby.

754
00:36:05,833 --> 00:36:08,249
Sorry to bring you
that news.

755
00:36:11,077 --> 00:36:12,081
Baby.

756
00:36:12,164 --> 00:36:13,582
Oh, congratulations,
guys.

757
00:36:13,666 --> 00:36:15,126
I'm so excited!

758
00:36:15,209 --> 00:36:16,623
Congratulations,
you guys.

759
00:36:16,706 --> 00:36:17,662
Congratulations.

760
00:36:17,745 --> 00:36:20,164
Wow. That's great.
Oh, your first.

761
00:36:20,248 --> 00:36:21,165
Thanks.

762
00:36:21,249 --> 00:36:22,125
Sorry about--

763
00:36:22,208 --> 00:36:23,626
That's all right.

764
00:36:23,708 --> 00:36:25,620
I've been
lied to before.

765
00:36:25,703 --> 00:36:27,120
You're good at it.

766
00:36:27,204 --> 00:36:29,999
We could use you
at the car lot.

767
00:36:30,125 --> 00:36:31,543
It's so exciting!

768
00:36:31,626 --> 00:36:33,662
We're happy for you.

769
00:36:33,745 --> 00:36:35,161
How are you feeling?

770
00:36:35,245 --> 00:36:37,165
I'm O.K.
A little tired.

771
00:36:37,249 --> 00:36:38,667
Everybody
gets tired,

772
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:41,163
but the whole
thing is just

773
00:36:41,247 --> 00:36:42,659
a life-changing
event.

774
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:44,665
I'll give
you my number.

775
00:36:44,748 --> 00:36:46,667
We can go
baby shopping.

776
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:49,163
You've got to
get that book,

777
00:36:49,247 --> 00:36:51,664
<i>What To Expect</i>
<i>When You're Expecting.</i>

778
00:36:51,747 --> 00:36:55,167
And we've got videos of
all her births.

779
00:36:55,251 --> 00:36:57,620
You've got to
film your first.

780
00:36:57,662 --> 00:37:00,123
That's the best.
It's the bloodiest--

781
00:37:00,164 --> 00:37:02,125
blood everywhere,
things shooting out,

782
00:37:02,166 --> 00:37:05,122
people screaming, stuff getting
torn and sewed together.

783
00:37:05,163 --> 00:37:08,373
It's like a good
World War II movie.

784
00:37:08,456 --> 00:37:10,125
Will you keep
the car?

785
00:37:10,166 --> 00:37:11,625
Yeah. It's fine now.

786
00:37:11,667 --> 00:37:13,869
Cost a bit of money.

787
00:37:13,953 --> 00:37:16,456
But it only seats
two people.

788
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,999
It always did.

789
00:37:18,041 --> 00:37:20,456
But you're going to
have a baby.

790
00:37:20,498 --> 00:37:23,956
You could never fit
a car seat in there.

791
00:37:23,997 --> 00:37:26,458
Listen, stop down
by the lot.

792
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:29,038
I'll make you
a good deal.

793
00:37:29,122 --> 00:37:30,618
All right?

794
00:37:30,701 --> 00:37:32,331
Great.

795
00:37:32,373 --> 00:37:34,709
Honey, we got to go.
Bad Chinese...

796
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:36,165
Buddy!

797
00:37:36,207 --> 00:37:38,160
Come on, baby.
Let's roll.

798
00:37:38,202 --> 00:37:39,664
See you guys.

799
00:37:39,706 --> 00:37:41,040
O.K.

800
00:37:41,124 --> 00:37:43,542
I hate him.
I loathe him.

801
00:37:43,625 --> 00:37:45,828
He tried to
sell me a new car.

802
00:37:45,869 --> 00:37:48,832
Can you believe that?
Tacky or what?

803
00:37:48,873 --> 00:37:50,333
Yeah,
but he's right.

804
00:37:50,375 --> 00:37:52,831
We're going to need
something bigger.

805
00:37:52,872 --> 00:37:55,664
But you know how much
I love my car.

806
00:37:55,706 --> 00:37:57,541
I've worked
hard for it.

807
00:37:57,624 --> 00:37:59,042
What do you
suggest?

808
00:37:59,126 --> 00:38:02,535
Tie the baby
to the hood like a deer?

809
00:38:02,617 --> 00:38:05,874
Well, no, but maybe
you could get a car.

810
00:38:05,958 --> 00:38:07,874
On my salary?
Come on.

811
00:38:07,916 --> 00:38:09,869
Well, put it this way.

812
00:38:09,911 --> 00:38:12,790
I'm not getting rid
of the car.

813
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:14,542
What about the cat?

814
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:16,124
Huh?

815
00:38:16,207 --> 00:38:19,120
What, you believe
Dr. Zhivago in there?

816
00:38:19,203 --> 00:38:20,915
The monkey doctor?

817
00:38:20,957 --> 00:38:23,376
He's right.
I've read about it.

818
00:38:23,458 --> 00:38:26,244
Cats can be dangerous
for a baby.

819
00:38:26,326 --> 00:38:29,249
They can suffocate
the baby, claw the baby.

820
00:38:29,332 --> 00:38:32,249
Skippy is 1 6.
He can barely move.

821
00:38:32,331 --> 00:38:33,744
He's half-blind.

822
00:38:33,828 --> 00:38:35,998
He's too weak
to suffocate anyone.

823
00:38:36,081 --> 00:38:38,500
What about hygiene
in the kitchen?

824
00:38:38,583 --> 00:38:41,869
You get cat hair
and cat saliva.

825
00:38:41,911 --> 00:38:44,665
You said that this baby
wouldn't change our lives.

826
00:38:44,748 --> 00:38:48,831
Now I have to sell my car
and get rid of my cat.

827
00:38:48,997 --> 00:38:50,827
This is the second month,

828
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:53,332
and our lives
are practically unrecognizable!

829
00:39:10,625 --> 00:39:13,537
I really appreciate
your asking us along.

830
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:16,582
I'm hoping this
will get Samuel excited

831
00:39:16,665 --> 00:39:18,083
about having a baby.

832
00:39:18,166 --> 00:39:19,584
Oh, yeah. Sure.

833
00:39:19,666 --> 00:39:21,080
Yeah, 'cause, um,

834
00:39:21,162 --> 00:39:22,576
if things
don't change,

835
00:39:22,659 --> 00:39:25,082
I'm thinking
about leaving him.

836
00:39:25,165 --> 00:39:27,084
Oh, yeah.
Yeah. Sure you are.

837
00:39:27,167 --> 00:39:30,077
I thought about leaving
Marty all the time,

838
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,582
but this
is his first time.

839
00:39:32,665 --> 00:39:35,584
You've got to
give him a chance.

840
00:39:35,666 --> 00:39:37,079
He's completely
uninvolved.

841
00:39:37,162 --> 00:39:40,081
This whole baby thing
really scares him.

842
00:39:40,164 --> 00:39:42,584
He's probably having
trouble facing it.

843
00:39:42,667 --> 00:39:44,581
If you have a baby,

844
00:39:44,664 --> 00:39:47,581
that means
he's got to grow up.

845
00:39:47,664 --> 00:39:50,584
The baby's the fun part.
That's fun.

846
00:39:50,667 --> 00:39:53,828
You know.
Look at all this stuff.

847
00:39:53,911 --> 00:39:55,329
Ah, yeah! Whoo!

848
00:39:55,413 --> 00:39:57,332
He's going to
love this.

849
00:39:57,416 --> 00:40:00,622
You know you're
having a boy, right?

850
00:40:00,706 --> 00:40:02,285
Yeah.

851
00:40:03,873 --> 00:40:07,292
Gail took one of those
amnio tests, I suppose.

852
00:40:07,375 --> 00:40:08,290
No.

853
00:40:08,373 --> 00:40:09,786
How do you know?

854
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:12,290
I can tell
it's a boy

855
00:40:12,373 --> 00:40:15,791
by the way she's
carrying it all in front.

856
00:40:15,874 --> 00:40:18,785
They don't often
carry them at the back.

857
00:40:18,869 --> 00:40:20,290
If it's a boy,

858
00:40:20,373 --> 00:40:22,792
they carry them low
like this.

859
00:40:22,876 --> 00:40:25,786
If it's a girl,
it's up like this.

860
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:27,831
Plus, there are
special ways

861
00:40:27,914 --> 00:40:30,834
to ensure that it
will be a boy.

862
00:40:30,917 --> 00:40:33,328
What do you mean,
special ways?

863
00:40:33,412 --> 00:40:35,329
Well,
when we made love...

864
00:40:35,413 --> 00:40:36,832
Yeah?

865
00:40:36,915 --> 00:40:38,667
we used
special positions.

866
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:40,165
Oh, please.

867
00:40:40,248 --> 00:40:43,162
That's an old wives' tale,
that stuff.

868
00:40:43,246 --> 00:40:44,498
You'll see.

869
00:40:45,791 --> 00:40:48,746
Sometimes I'm not sure
I want this baby.

870
00:40:48,788 --> 00:40:51,246
Oh, Missy,
of course you do.

871
00:40:51,288 --> 00:40:53,249
It's just
such a privilege.

872
00:40:53,291 --> 00:40:54,750
There's hundreds
of women

873
00:40:54,792 --> 00:40:57,661
who spend thousands
of dollars every day

874
00:40:57,744 --> 00:41:00,081
trying to
get pregnant.

875
00:41:00,165 --> 00:41:02,459
It's like our profound
biological right.

876
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,746
It's something men
can never experience.

877
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:07,664
It has to be
at the right time for you,

878
00:41:07,706 --> 00:41:08,999
but really,
it's a miracle.

879
00:41:09,082 --> 00:41:11,499
And then
when the baby comes,

880
00:41:11,583 --> 00:41:15,664
there's moments
of sheer happiness.

881
00:41:15,747 --> 00:41:18,792
Even if you're alone?

882
00:41:21,163 --> 00:41:24,123
I know it's fashionable,
PC, all that,

883
00:41:24,165 --> 00:41:27,125
to be a strong,
independent single mother,

884
00:41:27,208 --> 00:41:29,619
and, uh,
I'm prepared for that.

885
00:41:29,661 --> 00:41:31,664
I can do that,

886
00:41:31,706 --> 00:41:34,667
but, um, I would
love this baby

887
00:41:34,709 --> 00:41:38,161
to have a mother
and a father.

888
00:41:38,201 --> 00:41:41,166
I would love to
have a family,

889
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:44,372
and I would love to
marry Samuel.

890
00:41:44,456 --> 00:41:46,911
Um...

891
00:41:46,995 --> 00:41:49,916
all he has to do is ask.

892
00:41:51,915 --> 00:41:54,201
Oh, Missy.

893
00:42:01,703 --> 00:42:03,622
Okey-dokey.
Huh huh huh.

894
00:42:03,706 --> 00:42:06,625
O.K. Tell your mommy
if she loves you,

895
00:42:06,709 --> 00:42:09,619
she'll buy you
the whole Arnie collection!

896
00:42:09,661 --> 00:42:11,622
Thank you,
Arnie.

897
00:42:11,706 --> 00:42:13,124
Who loves you,
girls?

898
00:42:13,207 --> 00:42:15,125
- Arnie.
- Arnie.

899
00:42:15,208 --> 00:42:16,663
Hey, fellas.

900
00:42:16,747 --> 00:42:18,161
How about taking home

901
00:42:18,243 --> 00:42:21,166
a new Arnie doll
for the kiddies?

902
00:42:21,249 --> 00:42:22,667
No, thank you,
buddy.

903
00:42:22,751 --> 00:42:24,165
Mister,
you'd look great

904
00:42:24,248 --> 00:42:27,163
in my ''Arnie Loves You''
t-shirt.

905
00:42:27,246 --> 00:42:30,167
They come in
extra-extra-extra large.

906
00:42:30,208 --> 00:42:31,665
No, thank you.

907
00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:34,660
How about a new
''Arnie Loves You'' video?

908
00:42:34,744 --> 00:42:37,541
Love is for
you and me

909
00:42:37,583 --> 00:42:39,167
No, thanks. O.K.?

910
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:41,827
We are one
big family

911
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:44,165
I'm not going to
buy your damn video!

912
00:42:44,248 --> 00:42:46,500
But the kids
will love it.

913
00:42:46,542 --> 00:42:48,414
My kids think
your show sucks.

914
00:42:51,288 --> 00:42:52,623
Oh.

915
00:42:52,707 --> 00:42:54,625
But thanks,
anyway.

916
00:42:54,709 --> 00:42:57,619
Hey, no hard feelings,
O.K.?

917
00:42:57,703 --> 00:42:59,622
All right. Sorry.

918
00:42:59,706 --> 00:43:01,624
That's O.K.
Huh huh huh.

919
00:43:01,708 --> 00:43:03,125
So long.

920
00:43:03,167 --> 00:43:05,121
Eh, you cheap shit.

921
00:43:05,203 --> 00:43:06,618
What did you say?

922
00:43:06,702 --> 00:43:08,123
Huh?

923
00:43:08,206 --> 00:43:11,125
Oh, gee. I didn't say
nothing, mister.

924
00:43:11,208 --> 00:43:13,121
He didn't say
anything, Marty.

925
00:43:13,203 --> 00:43:15,246
Bye-bye.
Arnie loves you.

926
00:43:15,288 --> 00:43:17,374
You penis-head.

927
00:43:17,458 --> 00:43:18,875
I heard that!

928
00:43:18,958 --> 00:43:20,247
Heard what?

929
00:43:20,289 --> 00:43:22,911
I heard what you said!

930
00:43:22,995 --> 00:43:24,832
He's pathetic.
Come on.

931
00:43:24,915 --> 00:43:28,414
There's children around here,
for God's sake!

932
00:43:28,496 --> 00:43:29,661
So long...

933
00:43:29,745 --> 00:43:31,622
you fat-ass pussy!

934
00:43:31,664 --> 00:43:32,623
That's it!

935
00:43:32,665 --> 00:43:33,791
No.

936
00:43:33,833 --> 00:43:34,792
Yes!

937
00:43:34,834 --> 00:43:35,831
Uh-oh.

938
00:43:35,914 --> 00:43:37,661
No. No. Arnie.

939
00:43:37,745 --> 00:43:39,246
Come on,
you wiener.

940
00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:42,542
Come on,
you bitch.

941
00:43:42,625 --> 00:43:44,331
Here's one
for the queen.

942
00:43:44,414 --> 00:43:46,953
Oh!

943
00:43:47,037 --> 00:43:48,081
I'll get him, Sammy.

944
00:43:48,165 --> 00:43:49,458
Hey, cut it out.

945
00:43:49,499 --> 00:43:51,665
Oh, you hit
like a girl,

946
00:43:51,749 --> 00:43:52,996
you flatulent
butt-head.

947
00:43:53,079 --> 00:43:55,497
I'll take both
you wieners on.

948
00:43:55,581 --> 00:43:57,458
You and that
pussy boyfriend!

949
00:43:57,499 --> 00:43:59,457
Right, you bastard!

950
00:43:59,498 --> 00:44:02,243
Who's the fat pussy
now, buddy?

951
00:44:02,327 --> 00:44:05,750
Tell your sister
to let go of my tail,

952
00:44:05,833 --> 00:44:09,329
you weak-wristed
Nancy boy!

953
00:44:09,370 --> 00:44:11,204
Get off me,
you fat bastard!

954
00:44:11,288 --> 00:44:15,166
I'll shove an ''Arnie Loves You''
lunch box up your ass!

955
00:44:15,207 --> 00:44:17,329
Marty!

956
00:44:17,412 --> 00:44:18,493
Samuel!

957
00:44:18,535 --> 00:44:20,457
Oh, you--
Hi, honey.

958
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:22,459
He is
such a jerk!

959
00:44:22,542 --> 00:44:24,164
We're in trouble.

960
00:44:24,247 --> 00:44:25,994
Run to Mommy.

961
00:44:26,036 --> 00:44:27,789
I'll wipe the floor
with you.

962
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:29,666
Oh...

963
00:44:40,372 --> 00:44:42,410
Wow! That's, uh...

964
00:44:42,493 --> 00:44:44,749
that's quite a breakfast
you've got there.

965
00:44:44,832 --> 00:44:46,334
Mm-hmm!

966
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:47,789
Wow, you, uh...

967
00:44:47,873 --> 00:44:49,536
certainly got
your appetite back.

968
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:51,121
Mmm! Boy...

969
00:44:51,204 --> 00:44:53,124
I don't know
if you noticed--

970
00:44:53,207 --> 00:44:55,789
The first three months
were tough on me.

971
00:44:55,873 --> 00:44:57,536
But now, you know,

972
00:44:57,620 --> 00:44:58,953
my breasts
don't hurt,

973
00:44:59,037 --> 00:45:00,624
no more nausea
or insomnia,

974
00:45:00,707 --> 00:45:02,626
and I feel great!

975
00:45:02,708 --> 00:45:04,289
Oh! Good news.

976
00:45:04,371 --> 00:45:06,619
So, I was thinking,
you know,

977
00:45:06,702 --> 00:45:09,124
I know it's been
two months

978
00:45:09,208 --> 00:45:10,626
since we made love,

979
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:13,411
but maybe we could
fool around tonight.

980
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:16,290
Check!

981
00:45:16,373 --> 00:45:17,666
Leave the breakfast.

982
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:19,998
But I haven't
finished the food!

983
00:45:39,163 --> 00:45:41,458
O.K.
I'll be right back.

984
00:45:41,499 --> 00:45:42,791
Huh? What?

985
00:45:42,833 --> 00:45:44,289
I'll be right back.

986
00:45:44,330 --> 00:45:45,620
Wait here for me.

987
00:45:45,661 --> 00:45:47,121
Right. Right.

988
00:45:47,163 --> 00:45:48,665
Ready when
you are.

989
00:45:58,542 --> 00:45:59,831
Ow!

990
00:46:08,039 --> 00:46:09,328
Ready.

991
00:46:12,207 --> 00:46:15,664
I been really tryin' baby

992
00:46:17,702 --> 00:46:19,163
Tryin' to hold back

993
00:46:19,205 --> 00:46:22,167
This feeling for so long

994
00:46:22,209 --> 00:46:23,499
Oh, my God.

995
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:25,162
And if you feel

996
00:46:25,245 --> 00:46:28,207
Like I feel, baby

997
00:46:28,248 --> 00:46:29,625
Then come on

998
00:46:29,708 --> 00:46:30,792
Oh, wow.

999
00:46:30,874 --> 00:46:31,997
Oh, come on

1000
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:33,287
Whoo!

1001
00:46:33,369 --> 00:46:36,040
Let's get it on

1002
00:46:36,081 --> 00:46:38,792
Ah, babe

1003
00:46:38,874 --> 00:46:40,497
Let's get it on

1004
00:46:41,702 --> 00:46:43,790
Let's love, baby

1005
00:46:45,166 --> 00:46:48,455
Let's get it on

1006
00:46:48,538 --> 00:46:50,619
Sugar

1007
00:46:50,703 --> 00:46:53,291
Let's get it on

1008
00:46:54,874 --> 00:46:56,662
Ooh hoo hoo

1009
00:46:58,202 --> 00:47:00,248
Ha ha ha!

1010
00:47:00,290 --> 00:47:01,541
What is it?

1011
00:47:01,625 --> 00:47:03,290
It moved.

1012
00:47:03,373 --> 00:47:05,952
Huh? What moved?

1013
00:47:06,035 --> 00:47:07,831
The baby. It moved!

1014
00:47:07,915 --> 00:47:10,042
Oh.

1015
00:47:10,125 --> 00:47:11,332
Oh, right.

1016
00:47:11,415 --> 00:47:13,660
Here.
Put your hand here.

1017
00:47:13,744 --> 00:47:15,163
It's like bubbles.

1018
00:47:21,744 --> 00:47:24,165
I-I-I don't
feel anything.

1019
00:47:24,248 --> 00:47:25,666
No,just wait.

1020
00:47:29,245 --> 00:47:31,581
Oh. It stopped.

1021
00:47:31,664 --> 00:47:33,124
What a shame.

1022
00:47:33,166 --> 00:47:34,458
Yeah.

1023
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:35,790
It's an incredible
feeling.

1024
00:47:35,872 --> 00:47:36,953
Yeah?

1025
00:47:37,037 --> 00:47:38,118
Yeah.

1026
00:47:38,202 --> 00:47:41,291
I guess I got plenty
more time to feel it.

1027
00:47:41,374 --> 00:47:42,625
Yeah. Yeah.

1028
00:47:42,708 --> 00:47:44,164
Ohh...

1029
00:47:54,703 --> 00:47:57,666
Honey, do you think
we're hurting the baby?

1030
00:47:59,041 --> 00:48:00,497
No. No.

1031
00:48:05,208 --> 00:48:07,664
Because
if I can feel it,

1032
00:48:07,706 --> 00:48:09,619
then it can feel me.

1033
00:48:09,702 --> 00:48:12,165
No, I don't--
I don't think so.

1034
00:48:12,248 --> 00:48:13,708
Yeah.

1035
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:17,702
Yes, yes, yes,
it can.

1036
00:48:17,744 --> 00:48:19,956
What if the baby
can see?

1037
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:23,498
Um...see what,
my love?

1038
00:48:23,539 --> 00:48:25,328
Your penis
coming toward it.

1039
00:48:25,411 --> 00:48:28,290
That could scare
the hell out of a baby.

1040
00:48:28,374 --> 00:48:30,500
Rebecca, I-I--

1041
00:48:30,541 --> 00:48:33,328
What if your penis
caused brain damage?

1042
00:48:33,411 --> 00:48:34,535
Are you serious?

1043
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,290
I don't know, I just...

1044
00:48:36,374 --> 00:48:38,291
don't think
we should make love

1045
00:48:38,375 --> 00:48:40,288
until we talk
to the doctor.

1046
00:48:42,035 --> 00:48:43,205
Please?

1047
00:48:43,288 --> 00:48:46,291
We don't know what
could happen, hon.

1048
00:48:48,205 --> 00:48:49,495
O.K.

1049
00:48:51,246 --> 00:48:52,666
Fine.

1050
00:48:52,749 --> 00:48:54,541
Fine, fine, fine.

1051
00:48:54,583 --> 00:48:56,663
But you know what?

1052
00:48:56,746 --> 00:48:59,373
I bet
if we wait awhile,

1053
00:48:59,456 --> 00:49:02,167
we can feel
the baby move again.

1054
00:49:03,747 --> 00:49:05,162
Yeah. Yeah.

1055
00:49:05,244 --> 00:49:06,662
Yeah.

1056
00:49:06,745 --> 00:49:09,166
That will be
just as much fun.

1057
00:49:30,787 --> 00:49:32,165
Uh!

1058
00:49:33,416 --> 00:49:35,456
That's my game.

1059
00:49:35,539 --> 00:49:37,619
Fuck! Shit! Shit!

1060
00:49:37,702 --> 00:49:38,955
Aah!

1061
00:49:40,207 --> 00:49:41,708
Hey, hey, Sam.

1062
00:49:41,792 --> 00:49:43,123
Fuck!

1063
00:49:43,165 --> 00:49:44,621
Ho!

1064
00:49:46,203 --> 00:49:47,623
O.K., that's it.

1065
00:49:47,706 --> 00:49:49,291
No more tennis
for today.

1066
00:49:49,375 --> 00:49:50,707
That's it.

1067
00:49:50,749 --> 00:49:52,787
What happened to your
British etiquette?

1068
00:49:52,870 --> 00:49:57,124
This John McEnroe thing
is scaring me.

1069
00:49:57,208 --> 00:50:00,163
Um, Sam,
what's the matter?

1070
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:01,661
What's the matter?

1071
00:50:01,744 --> 00:50:04,165
I'm in the middle
of a nervous breakdown.

1072
00:50:04,249 --> 00:50:06,166
You're going
to have a thrombo.

1073
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:07,664
What's the matter?
Why?

1074
00:50:07,747 --> 00:50:09,161
O.K.

1075
00:50:09,245 --> 00:50:12,165
Rebecca is
pregnant. There.

1076
00:50:12,249 --> 00:50:13,667
What?

1077
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:15,664
I am completely
sexually frustrated.

1078
00:50:15,747 --> 00:50:17,661
I do not
sleep at night.

1079
00:50:17,744 --> 00:50:19,665
I have these
appalling nightmares.

1080
00:50:19,748 --> 00:50:21,166
About what?

1081
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:24,163
The latest nightmare
is that the baby is deformed--

1082
00:50:24,247 --> 00:50:25,661
It's missing an arm,

1083
00:50:25,744 --> 00:50:27,665
or it's got
cauliflower ears

1084
00:50:27,748 --> 00:50:29,625
with an eye
on its forehead.

1085
00:50:29,667 --> 00:50:32,121
I can't stand it!
I don't know why...
