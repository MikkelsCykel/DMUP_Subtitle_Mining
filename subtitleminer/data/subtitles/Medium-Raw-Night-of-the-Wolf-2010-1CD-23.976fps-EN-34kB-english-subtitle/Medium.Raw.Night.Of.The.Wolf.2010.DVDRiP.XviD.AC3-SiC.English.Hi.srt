1
00:00:07,623 --> 00:00:11,059
# I could give you #

2
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:13,494
# Comfort #

3
00:00:13,529 --> 00:00:18,466
# I could lay you down #

4
00:00:18,501 --> 00:00:21,402
# I could be #

5
00:00:21,437 --> 00:00:23,928
# The one #

6
00:00:23,973 --> 00:00:28,569
# Who cares #

7
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:31,580
# I could take #

8
00:00:31,614 --> 00:00:33,878
# The fear #

9
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:39,946
# The disappointment #

10
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:45,120
# You've had enough #

11
00:00:45,161 --> 00:00:48,324
# You've had enough... #

12
00:00:48,364 --> 00:00:51,595
(children playing)

13
00:01:09,185 --> 00:01:11,346
(birds chirping)

14
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:22,858
Boy: I saw you, Katie.
Now it's your turn.

15
00:01:22,899 --> 00:01:25,026
- Katie: Go hide. I'll find you.
- Boy: Don't peek.

16
00:01:25,367 --> 00:01:27,968
One, two,

17
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,370
three,

18
00:01:30,406 --> 00:01:32,397
four.

19
00:01:33,476 --> 00:01:35,944
Ready or not, here I come.

20
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:43,475
(giggling)

21
00:01:46,489 --> 00:01:48,013
(rustling)

22
00:01:48,057 --> 00:01:49,388
Katie: Johnny?

23
00:01:55,264 --> 00:01:57,698
Johnny, come out. I found you.

24
00:02:09,078 --> 00:02:11,808
(giggling)

25
00:02:13,549 --> 00:02:16,518
Johnny?

26
00:02:16,552 --> 00:02:18,577
- (screaming)
- (gasps)

27
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:25,120
(Katie screaming)

28
00:02:25,161 --> 00:02:28,995
(gasps, panting)

29
00:02:29,031 --> 00:02:31,056
Johnny, are you okay?

30
00:02:36,839 --> 00:02:38,898
It's just another nightmare.

31
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,139
(Katie screaming) Johnny!

32
00:02:55,892 --> 00:02:57,883
P.A. Announcer: Here at Parker's Asylum,

33
00:02:57,927 --> 00:02:59,918
we strive to reach new levels
of commitment

34
00:02:59,962 --> 00:03:02,396
in bringing new methods of treatment
to our patients.

35
00:03:04,533 --> 00:03:07,331
Parker's Asylum was built in 1929,

36
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,565
but has changed considerably since then.

37
00:03:09,605 --> 00:03:13,632
Although security remains foremost
in the minds of staff at Parker's,

38
00:03:13,676 --> 00:03:17,077
the well-being of the patients
is second to none.

39
00:03:20,249 --> 00:03:22,114
- (beeps)
- Male voice: Access granted.

40
00:03:22,151 --> 00:03:24,915
P.A. Announcer:
Parker's Asylum is divided

41
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:27,548
into two sections of treatment:

42
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:30,889
The atrium and traditional
psychiatric ward on the top floors;

43
00:03:30,927 --> 00:03:34,328
and the extreme cases ward
on the lower levels.

44
00:03:38,501 --> 00:03:41,527
Upon entering the extreme cases ward,

45
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:44,664
please stow away any personal items.

46
00:03:44,707 --> 00:03:47,335
Any unauthorized personnel
please check in

47
00:03:47,376 --> 00:03:49,606
with the security station to the right.

48
00:03:51,647 --> 00:03:52,875
Have a nice day.

49
00:03:52,915 --> 00:03:55,213
(patient mumbling)

50
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,615
(gate buzzes)

51
00:04:06,295 --> 00:04:08,354
(P.A. Chatter)

52
00:04:28,217 --> 00:04:29,878
P.A. Announcer: This is a reminder

53
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,012
that patients in the extreme cases ward

54
00:04:32,054 --> 00:04:34,716
are sensitive to certain
forms of persuasion.

55
00:04:34,757 --> 00:04:37,624
Please refrain from casual dialogue.

56
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,753
Woman: How's Johnny?
Is he sleeping any better?

57
00:04:39,795 --> 00:04:41,990
Woman #2: No, I'm afraid not.

58
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:44,397
Woman: Oh, that's too bad.
Is he still having...?

59
00:04:44,433 --> 00:04:46,264
Woman #2: Nightmares? Yeah.

60
00:04:46,302 --> 00:04:48,133
I don't know, Karen. It's odd.

61
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:50,263
It's almost like any progress
we made together

62
00:04:50,306 --> 00:04:52,171
is undone by a single night's dream.

63
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,768
Karen: I'm sure it'll pass
with time, Jamie.

64
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:57,643
Jamie: I'm trying to help him, but...

65
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,808
Karen: When my husband died,
I couldn't sleep for years.

66
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:02,511
Were Johnny and his sister close?

67
00:05:02,551 --> 00:05:05,247
Jamie: Johnny doesn't like
to talk about it. He internalizes.

68
00:05:08,491 --> 00:05:10,652
Mabel, I need you to stay in the corner.

69
00:05:10,693 --> 00:05:12,684
I'm coming in, okay?

70
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,730
Looking forward to the day
that I don't have to wear this anymore.

71
00:05:22,738 --> 00:05:24,763
(beeps)

72
00:05:26,108 --> 00:05:28,201
- (door buzzes)
- Male voice: Access granted.

73
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:31,304
You be careful.

74
00:06:03,412 --> 00:06:06,074
I brought the picture
like I said I would, Mabel.

75
00:06:22,064 --> 00:06:24,191
You can take a look at it, if you like.

76
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,833
This your husband?

77
00:06:33,876 --> 00:06:36,106
Jamie: Yes.

78
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:39,376
Is it true what they say?

79
00:06:40,716 --> 00:06:42,650
What?

80
00:06:42,685 --> 00:06:45,586
That all the good ones are taken.

81
00:06:47,289 --> 00:06:49,314
I don't know about that.

82
00:06:49,358 --> 00:06:53,818
I think good is relative.

83
00:06:53,863 --> 00:06:55,922
Don't you?

84
00:06:57,433 --> 00:07:00,129
How are you feeling today, Mabel?

85
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:04,302
I'm hungry, Doctor.

86
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:09,669
If I'm going to help you,

87
00:07:09,712 --> 00:07:11,771
I need you to trust me.

88
00:07:11,814 --> 00:07:15,079
It's gonna take some time,
but we can do this together.

89
00:07:15,117 --> 00:07:17,642
I know, Doctor.

90
00:07:17,686 --> 00:07:22,316
You've always been there for me,

91
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:26,818
always treated me like a real person.

92
00:07:26,862 --> 00:07:31,322
You are a real person, Mabel.

93
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:34,564
Jamie, can I call you Jamie

94
00:07:34,603 --> 00:07:36,730
like your friends do?

95
00:07:36,772 --> 00:07:40,208
Yes, of course you can.

96
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:44,110
Well, Jamie,

97
00:07:44,146 --> 00:07:46,512
can I ask

98
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,574
for a favor?

99
00:07:55,124 --> 00:07:57,456
That depends, Mabel.

100
00:07:59,428 --> 00:08:00,656
What is it?

101
00:08:02,765 --> 00:08:05,029
I was wondering

102
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:07,900
if I could

103
00:08:07,937 --> 00:08:12,533
just

104
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:15,135
lick your hand.

105
00:08:15,177 --> 00:08:19,079
I wouldn't bite. I promise.

106
00:08:19,114 --> 00:08:21,275
Just a little taste.

107
00:08:21,317 --> 00:08:24,150
You know I can't let you do that, Mabel.

108
00:08:24,186 --> 00:08:28,054
- You know the rules.
- But you said we were friends!

109
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,388
I know, Mabel.

110
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:32,326
I'm sorry.

111
00:08:58,787 --> 00:09:01,255
Maybe we'll try again tomorrow.

112
00:09:06,228 --> 00:09:08,423
(Mabel grunts)

113
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:11,126
- (electricity zapping)
- (Mabel whimpering)

114
00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:36,888
(Jamie knocks) Open the door.

115
00:09:38,227 --> 00:09:38,294
- (sirens wailing)
- (police radio chatter)

116
00:09:38,294 --> 00:09:40,888
- (sirens wailing)
- (police radio chatter)

117
00:09:56,545 --> 00:09:58,740
Sorry I got you out of bed
so early, kid,

118
00:09:58,781 --> 00:10:01,375
but I thought it important
that you should be here.

119
00:10:01,417 --> 00:10:03,078
What've we got?

120
00:10:03,118 --> 00:10:05,382
(sighs) Come on.

121
00:10:05,421 --> 00:10:08,913
Well, it appears to be a double
homicide, but I can't be sure.

122
00:10:10,859 --> 00:10:12,326
The bodies are missing...

123
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:15,091
a six-year-old girl Lily Abbott

124
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:17,189
and her 17-year-old babysitter.

125
00:10:17,232 --> 00:10:19,928
Neighbors called in a disturbance
a few hours ago.

126
00:10:19,968 --> 00:10:21,526
How bad?

127
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:24,266
Johnny,

128
00:10:24,306 --> 00:10:27,833
I called you in here for a reason.

129
00:10:27,876 --> 00:10:30,401
Elliot,

130
00:10:30,446 --> 00:10:32,914
what's in the room?

131
00:10:45,494 --> 00:10:47,792
As soon as I saw it, I had to call you.

132
00:10:51,033 --> 00:10:54,400
I mean

133
00:10:54,436 --> 00:10:56,563
it could be a copycat.

134
00:10:56,605 --> 00:10:59,005
The message is the same,

135
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:03,410
but Wolf was never this messy.

136
00:11:03,445 --> 00:11:05,606
Are you sure?

137
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:11,485
Johnny, I never said this to you,

138
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,886
but I have to say it now.

139
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:20,058
I am so sorry that I did not catch
your sister's killer.

140
00:11:20,095 --> 00:11:23,394
I promise you I did my best.

141
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:25,923
I hunted him night and day for 10 years.

142
00:11:25,968 --> 00:11:27,936
I got nothing... nothing!

143
00:11:28,937 --> 00:11:32,031
On my watch he killed

144
00:11:32,074 --> 00:11:35,908
15 innocent young girls...

145
00:11:35,944 --> 00:11:38,242
15!

146
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,840
You don't know what it's like
to close your eyes

147
00:11:40,883 --> 00:11:43,443
and see those innocent eyes
looking back at you.

148
00:11:46,488 --> 00:11:49,582
Yeah, I do.

149
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,559
But he's back now

150
00:11:51,593 --> 00:11:53,584
and we've got a chance
to make things right.

151
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:55,392
Do you understand me?

152
00:11:55,431 --> 00:11:57,831
I will not stop.

153
00:12:02,271 --> 00:12:04,296
Yeah.

154
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:10,311
But where... where do we start?

155
00:12:10,345 --> 00:12:12,575
I mean, the lab will find out nothing.

156
00:12:12,614 --> 00:12:14,639
The Big Bad Wolf.

157
00:12:14,683 --> 00:12:17,151
Yeah.

158
00:12:17,186 --> 00:12:19,654
"Little Red Riding Hood."

159
00:12:19,688 --> 00:12:21,315
But what does it mean?

160
00:12:21,356 --> 00:12:25,190
Elliot, could you give me
a minute alone here?

161
00:12:27,396 --> 00:12:29,387
Yeah.

162
00:12:29,431 --> 00:12:31,626
Sure.

163
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:33,692
Thanks.

164
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:47,777
(children laughing)

165
00:12:47,816 --> 00:12:49,408
Johnny, come out. I found you.

166
00:12:52,387 --> 00:12:54,719
(screaming)

167
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,791
Katie: No! Help!

168
00:12:59,828 --> 00:13:01,819
- (knife snicking, flesh tearing)
- Katie: Help!

169
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:05,027
(Katie screaming) Johnny!

170
00:13:06,935 --> 00:13:08,869
(screaming stops)

171
00:13:31,226 --> 00:13:33,490
Elliot's voice: The message is the same.

172
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,659
Johnny's voice: The Big Bad Wolf.

173
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,110
Elliot's voice:
"Little Red Riding Hood."

174
00:14:09,965 --> 00:14:11,990
(phone ringing)

175
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,870
(people chattering)

176
00:14:16,872 --> 00:14:18,499
This is Gallant.

177
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,064
Pete, it's Johnny. You got a second?

178
00:14:20,108 --> 00:14:22,303
Hey, Johnny, what's going on?
I'm sitting down at my desk.

179
00:14:22,344 --> 00:14:24,642
Just working on a hunch.
Can you run a check

180
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,875
on any known addresses
on one Gayle Abbott...

181
00:14:26,915 --> 00:14:28,610
G-A-Y-L-E.

182
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:32,518
G-A-Y-L-E. Got it.

183
00:14:32,554 --> 00:14:34,078
All right, Johnny,

184
00:14:34,122 --> 00:14:36,181
I have two addresses.

185
00:14:36,224 --> 00:14:38,215
One is downtown and the other one...

186
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,955
looks like it's out in the sticks.

187
00:14:39,995 --> 00:14:41,553
Give me that one.

188
00:14:41,597 --> 00:14:44,862
It's 65 North Hill Road.

189
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,925
(thunder rumbling)

190
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,994
Thanks, Pete.

191
00:14:49,037 --> 00:14:50,732
I owe you one.

192
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,505
(piano music playing)

193
00:14:55,544 --> 00:14:57,842
You wanted to see me, sir?

194
00:14:57,879 --> 00:14:59,574
Yes. Close the door.

195
00:15:06,188 --> 00:15:08,179
A new mask for your collection?

196
00:15:08,223 --> 00:15:11,090
It's African.
Masks are held in high esteem

197
00:15:11,126 --> 00:15:13,390
in some African cultures.

198
00:15:13,428 --> 00:15:15,919
They're believed to be
the resting place for spirits.

199
00:15:15,964 --> 00:15:19,263
Some even believe
that the spirits make the masks

200
00:15:19,301 --> 00:15:21,269
and they materialize overnight.

201
00:15:21,303 --> 00:15:22,827
You don't believe that, do you?

202
00:15:22,871 --> 00:15:25,066
No.

203
00:15:25,107 --> 00:15:26,836
But I think it's neat.

204
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:29,742
Please sit down.

205
00:15:32,214 --> 00:15:34,148
So how's married life treating you?

206
00:15:34,182 --> 00:15:35,444
How's Johnny?

207
00:15:35,484 --> 00:15:37,247
Uh, he's doing well.

208
00:15:37,285 --> 00:15:40,254
We have to work on our schedules
a little bit better, but...

209
00:15:40,288 --> 00:15:41,550
I'm worried about you, Jamie.

210
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:44,354
I may have made a mistake
putting you on the Hatcher case.

211
00:15:44,393 --> 00:15:46,486
With all due respect, sir,

212
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,928
I'm making progress with Mabel.

213
00:15:48,964 --> 00:15:51,592
I think you're confusing
friendship with progress.

214
00:15:51,633 --> 00:15:54,067
You've gotten close to Mabel, I grant,

215
00:15:54,102 --> 00:15:56,935
but progress... I'm not so sure.

216
00:15:56,972 --> 00:15:59,099
But friendship is the first step
with Mabel.

217
00:15:59,141 --> 00:16:01,473
I assure you, sir,
that my latest report will show...

218
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:02,875
Show what?

219
00:16:02,911 --> 00:16:05,379
That she nearly took a bite
out of you just now?

220
00:16:05,414 --> 00:16:09,441
You're lucky it wasn't Mr. Jacobs
who threw that temper tantrum.

221
00:16:09,484 --> 00:16:12,419
Yes, sir.

222
00:16:12,454 --> 00:16:16,049
I need you to remember
what we're doing here, Jamie.

223
00:16:16,091 --> 00:16:18,582
We want to rehabilitate,

224
00:16:18,627 --> 00:16:21,255
but to think that the likes
of Miss Hatcher and Mr. Jacobs

225
00:16:21,296 --> 00:16:23,423
could ever reintegrate...

226
00:16:23,465 --> 00:16:25,626
let's just say that there's a reason

227
00:16:25,667 --> 00:16:28,431
why these patients are kept separate
from the world above.

228
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:30,028
I won't give up on her, sir.

229
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,404
Nobody's asking you to give up.

230
00:16:32,441 --> 00:16:34,705
It's important... what we do here.

231
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:38,770
But... well,

232
00:16:38,814 --> 00:16:40,975
food for thought:

233
00:16:41,016 --> 00:16:43,007
Years ago it was believed

234
00:16:43,051 --> 00:16:46,316
that those who were afflicted
with mental illness were...

235
00:16:46,354 --> 00:16:49,619
were actually possessed by demons.

236
00:16:51,693 --> 00:16:54,958
Remember that the next time
you let Mabel get too close to you.

237
00:16:56,131 --> 00:16:58,326
Dismissed.

238
00:17:36,304 --> 00:17:38,329
(thunder rumbling)

239
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,971
Did you find anything?

240
00:17:47,015 --> 00:17:48,983
That truck looks new.

241
00:17:52,254 --> 00:17:54,552
It's gonna be dark soon.

242
00:17:54,589 --> 00:17:56,750
We should call in some backup.

243
00:17:59,561 --> 00:18:01,552
Or not.

244
00:18:29,257 --> 00:18:31,282
(rain pattering)

245
00:19:11,132 --> 00:19:12,861
(rustling)

246
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:15,233
(music box playing)

247
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:40,926
God hates a coward.

248
00:19:56,144 --> 00:19:58,374
(people laughing)

249
00:19:58,413 --> 00:20:00,438
Shh.

250
00:20:00,482 --> 00:20:02,973
This guy is a real maniac...

251
00:20:03,018 --> 00:20:05,316
a real maniac.

252
00:20:06,321 --> 00:20:09,222
Is that your professional opinion?

253
00:20:10,225 --> 00:20:12,989
(man moaning)

254
00:20:13,028 --> 00:20:16,020
P.A. Announcer: In the event
of a medical emergency

255
00:20:16,064 --> 00:20:18,294
- or if you require assistance...
- (steady beeping)

256
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:21,200
...staff members can be recognized
by photo identification...

257
00:20:21,236 --> 00:20:23,670
Nurse: Benjamin Jacobs.

258
00:20:23,705 --> 00:20:26,970
A real maniac?

259
00:20:27,008 --> 00:20:28,976
Guard: All of them.

260
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:30,238
Why?

261
00:20:30,278 --> 00:20:31,506
Now watch this.

262
00:20:31,546 --> 00:20:33,844
(Benny growling)

263
00:20:36,017 --> 00:20:41,455
(steady beeping)

264
00:20:41,489 --> 00:20:44,049
Guard: He was abused as a kid,

265
00:20:44,092 --> 00:20:46,117
raised in a freak show.

266
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:47,389
(taps)

267
00:20:48,897 --> 00:20:50,660
Hates the color red...

268
00:20:50,699 --> 00:20:53,293
hates it.

269
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:56,065
The beeping lets you know
when he's angry.

270
00:20:56,104 --> 00:20:58,004
- Let me try.
- No.

271
00:20:58,039 --> 00:21:00,530
Come on. Give it to me.

272
00:21:02,644 --> 00:21:04,578
(growling)

273
00:21:06,881 --> 00:21:09,111

274
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,915
P.A. Announcer: Safety at Parker's
is everyone's responsibility.

275
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:18,949
(rattling)

276
00:21:18,994 --> 00:21:21,554
Do your part to ensure
a work environment

277
00:21:21,596 --> 00:21:24,997
that is safe for both
patient and worker.

278
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:27,058

(roaring)

280
00:21:30,338 --> 00:21:32,636
What happened?

281
00:21:32,674 --> 00:21:35,268
- What did you do?
- Nothing. We did nothing.

282
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:37,574
- Marty.
- She did it.

283
00:21:39,447 --> 00:21:41,347
Grab the tranq gun.
If I can't calm him down

284
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:43,510
you're gonna have to use it.

285
00:21:46,755 --> 00:21:49,724
Benny, it's Dr. Morgan.

286
00:21:49,758 --> 00:21:52,124
I need you to listen to me, okay?

287
00:21:56,831 --> 00:21:59,231
(roaring)

288
00:21:59,267 --> 00:22:02,725
Listen to my voice and calm down.

289
00:22:09,778 --> 00:22:11,302
Benny.

290
00:22:14,816 --> 00:22:17,148

Are you feeling better, Benny?

302
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:57,817
Yes, pretty lady.

303
00:23:08,436 --> 00:23:10,700
Good night, Benny.

304
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:15,676
P.A. Announcer:
Reminder that every Wednesday

305
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:18,178
the cleaning of cell blocks 8, 9...

306
00:23:18,213 --> 00:23:20,306
You are both very lucky.

P.A. Announcer: And 14 will commence.

308

We all are.

309
00:23:25,053 --> 00:23:27,248
P.A. Announcer: Please make
the necessary arrangements

310
00:23:27,288 --> 00:23:28,846
with scheduling.

311
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:30,380

(music continues)

315
00:24:45,466 --> 00:24:48,128
God damn it, Elliot. It's not her.

316
00:24:48,169 --> 00:24:49,636
It's just a doll.

317
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:58,305
He knew that we would find this.

318
00:24:58,346 --> 00:25:00,075
He set a trap.

319
00:25:00,114 --> 00:25:03,345
All right, you stay cool, kid.

320
00:25:03,384 --> 00:25:07,218
I'll find something
that'll pry this open.

321
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:09,280
Stay cool.

322
00:25:26,841 --> 00:25:28,809
Shit.

323
00:25:28,843 --> 00:25:31,676
Elliot, hurry up.

00:25:50,765 --> 00:25:52,164
(screams)

325
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,833
Elliot!

Johnny's voice: He's still alive.

331
00:27:38,806 --> 00:27:42,242
We can confirm the identity
of the Wolf as one...

332
00:27:42,276 --> 00:27:43,834
Harold Grierson.

333
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:47,607
Johnny's voice: He just let them die.

334

Elliot's voice: God hates a coward,

335
00:27:49,884 --> 00:27:51,749
The Wolf has been rendered speechless,

336
00:27:51,786 --> 00:27:53,845
shot in the throat...

337
00:27:55,223 --> 00:27:57,214
Jamie: It's doubtful
that he'll ever speak again.

338
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:59,590
Male announcer:
...by Detective Johnny Morgan.

339
00:27:59,627 --> 00:28:01,618
Johnny's voice:
They haven't found the girl, Jamie.

340
00:28:01,662 --> 00:28:04,187
Jamie's voice: Johnny,

341
00:28:04,232 --> 00:28:06,427
you're alive.

342
00:28:06,467 --> 00:28:07,798
(thunder crashing)

343
00:28:07,835 --> 00:28:10,269
Johnny's voice: I can make him talk.

344
00:28:10,304 --> 00:28:12,534
The location of the bodies
remains unknown.

345
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:15,936
Johnny's voice: I'm sorry, Katie.

346
00:28:15,977 --> 00:28:18,746
I'm sorry.

347
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:27,110
Woman: Thanks to the strong testimony

348
00:28:27,155 --> 00:28:29,919
and recommendation of Dr. Parker,
I'm proud to say

349
00:28:29,957 --> 00:28:31,948
that my client, Mr. Harold Grierson,

350
00:28:31,993 --> 00:28:35,554
will finally be released into his
custody where he can begin treatment...

351
00:28:35,596 --> 00:28:37,860
Looks like we're gonna have to
make room for another one.

352
00:28:37,899 --> 00:28:40,424
Also at the courthouse
was Detective Johnny Morgan,

353
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:42,993
the officer responsible
for catching the Wolf.

354
00:28:43,037 --> 00:28:45,597
Mr. Morgan, do you believe
justice has been served today?

355
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,902
No comment.

356
00:28:46,941 --> 00:28:49,501
Although the victims' bodies
have never been found,

357
00:28:49,544 --> 00:28:51,910
this effectively wraps up
the final chapter

358
00:28:51,946 --> 00:28:54,847
in the gruesome story
of the Red Riding Hood murders.

359
00:28:57,051 --> 00:28:59,849
Woman on radio: # Season light #

360
00:28:59,887 --> 00:29:03,516
# Season bright... #

361
00:29:03,558 --> 00:29:05,651
P.A. Announcer: Board of directors
at Parker's Asylum,

362
00:29:05,693 --> 00:29:07,251
we would like to wish you...

363
00:29:07,295 --> 00:29:09,593
- Have a good holiday. Bye.
...a safe and happy holiday.

364
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:13,088
Hey, Jam, what's the deal?
Why is everyone leaving early?

365
00:29:13,134 --> 00:29:16,160
Dr. Parker's just in good spirits.

366
00:29:17,705 --> 00:29:20,731
It's nothing, Marty. Have fun.

367
00:29:20,775 --> 00:29:24,302
P.A. Announcer: In the event
of a medical emergency...

368
00:29:41,562 --> 00:29:43,894
Are we still gonna go through with this?

369
00:29:48,503 --> 00:29:50,937
Jamie doesn't know anything
about this, does she?

370
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:55,569
We're separated, Pete.

371
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:57,601
I wouldn't know how to go
about telling her.

372
00:29:57,645 --> 00:30:01,638
You don't think she'll be
at all surprised to see you?

373
00:30:01,682 --> 00:30:04,583
Look, all I'm saying is
maybe you should give her a call,

374
00:30:04,619 --> 00:30:07,019
let her know.

375
00:30:13,828 --> 00:30:16,991
Mr. Walthrop, you can
open your eyes now.

376
00:30:18,866 --> 00:30:21,061
I got you something.

377
00:30:21,102 --> 00:30:23,627
I hope you like them.

378
00:30:36,817 --> 00:30:39,308
Merry Christmas, Oliver.

379
00:30:44,125 --> 00:30:47,094
P.A. Announcer:
This is a reminder that every Monday...

380
00:30:47,128 --> 00:30:50,996
- Hey.
...cleaning of cell blocks 3, 13...

381
00:30:51,032 --> 00:30:53,899
Sabrina.

382
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:55,163
There you are.

383
00:30:55,202 --> 00:30:59,138
Oh, I thought I told you
to not run off like that.

384
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:04,735
I told Dr. Parker
about Sabrina's condition

385
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:06,576
and he thought he might be able
to help her.

386
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:08,275
She still not talking?

387
00:31:08,316 --> 00:31:10,307
No, I'm afraid not.

388
00:31:10,351 --> 00:31:12,717
Ever since her mother died,
she's been so withdrawn

389
00:31:12,753 --> 00:31:14,584
from everyone and everything.

390
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:16,522
I can feel myself losing her

391
00:31:16,557 --> 00:31:18,354
and I don't even know where she's going.

392
00:31:18,392 --> 00:31:21,555
Jamie: If anyone can get through to her,
it's Dr. Parker.

393
00:31:21,596 --> 00:31:23,188
She's in good hands.

394
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:25,255
(buzz)

395
00:31:27,535 --> 00:31:29,696
Quick, follow me.

396
00:31:29,737 --> 00:31:31,864
Stay behind me, okay?

397
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:42,249
P.A. Announcer: Please check in
with the security station to the right.

398
00:31:42,283 --> 00:31:44,911
Have a nice day.

399
00:31:44,952 --> 00:31:46,749
Follow me.

400
00:32:44,245 --> 00:32:46,543
Mr. Grierson,

401
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:49,481
I want you to listen to me
very carefully.

402
00:32:49,517 --> 00:32:52,384
What I'm about to put around your neck

403
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,513
is a proximity restraint collar.

404
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:56,648
It'll shock you into submission

405
00:32:56,691 --> 00:32:58,921
if you break the 2' distance regulation

406
00:32:58,959 --> 00:33:01,689
with any of my personnel.

407
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:05,256
And I can assure you, Mr. Grierson,

408
00:33:05,299 --> 00:33:07,733
it's not a pleasant feeling.

409
00:33:17,311 --> 00:33:18,505
(beeps)

410
00:33:24,618 --> 00:33:26,643
Release him.

411
00:33:41,469 --> 00:33:44,438
Mr. Grierson's collared
and ready for you, sir.

412
00:33:44,472 --> 00:33:45,700
Good.

413
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:49,301
Oh, may I remind you
of your meeting today

414
00:33:49,343 --> 00:33:51,243
with Mr. Grierson's attorney...
Miss Garvey?

415
00:33:51,278 --> 00:33:53,269
She'll be arriving shortly.

416
00:33:53,314 --> 00:33:55,179
She's fairly keen on making sure

417
00:33:55,216 --> 00:33:57,514
that her client's adequately cared for.

418
00:33:57,551 --> 00:34:01,009
He stopped being her client the moment
he was wheeled through that door.

419
00:34:01,055 --> 00:34:02,386
I'll handle Miss Garvey.

420
00:34:02,423 --> 00:34:03,981
Yes, sir.

421
00:34:17,271 --> 00:34:19,569
Do you know who I am?

422
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:25,436
I know who you think you are.

423
00:34:26,714 --> 00:34:28,341
The Wolf.

424
00:34:29,917 --> 00:34:32,351
You like that, don't you?

425
00:34:32,386 --> 00:34:34,820
It makes you larger than life.

426
00:34:34,855 --> 00:34:36,948
It scares your victims into thinking

427
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:41,223
they're being hunted by a monster
from their nightmares.

428
00:34:41,262 --> 00:34:44,425
I bet you think
you can smell their fear.

429
00:34:44,465 --> 00:34:46,729
Well, you'd be wrong.

430
00:34:46,767 --> 00:34:49,565
Fear has no smell,

431
00:34:49,603 --> 00:34:52,071
no taste, no sound.

432
00:34:53,641 --> 00:34:55,700
It's simply a state of being.

433
00:34:58,879 --> 00:35:01,245
Your name is Harold Grierson

434
00:35:01,282 --> 00:35:03,716
and you're an animal.

435
00:35:03,751 --> 00:35:06,481
And as an animal,
you can always be counted on

436
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,920
to react in a certain way

437
00:35:08,956 --> 00:35:12,687
when placed in a certain situation.

438
00:35:12,726 --> 00:35:16,127
Behind me is an open door...

439
00:35:16,163 --> 00:35:18,563
your ticket to freedom.

440
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:20,965
All that stands in your way

441
00:35:21,001 --> 00:35:22,434
is me.

442
00:35:22,469 --> 00:35:24,869
Surely I'm no match

443
00:35:24,905 --> 00:35:26,930
for the Big Bad Wolf.

444
00:35:26,974 --> 00:35:29,306
Well, come on, Grierson,

445
00:35:29,343 --> 00:35:31,470
take me down.

446
00:35:31,512 --> 00:35:33,139
Claim your prize.

447
00:35:37,484 --> 00:35:40,044
Well,

448
00:35:40,087 --> 00:35:43,682
if you won't come to me,

449
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:45,715
I'll just have to come to you.

450
00:35:47,661 --> 00:35:49,788
Come on, Grierson...

451
00:35:52,132 --> 00:35:53,827
howl for me.

452
00:35:54,835 --> 00:35:56,427
(grunts)

453
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:08,915
Wolves are smart, cunning,

454
00:36:08,949 --> 00:36:10,974
quick.

455
00:36:11,018 --> 00:36:13,782
They're not easily caught.

456
00:36:15,422 --> 00:36:18,050
You are but a common dog.

457
00:36:21,128 --> 00:36:23,153
Lock the door.

458
00:36:23,197 --> 00:36:26,633
(door squeaks, closes)

459
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:30,835
(piano music playing)

460
00:36:30,871 --> 00:36:33,863
If you'll have a seat,
Dr. Parker will be with you momentarily.

461
00:36:35,709 --> 00:36:40,669
And don't touch anything, huh?

462
00:37:11,612 --> 00:37:13,739
Hello again.

463
00:37:13,781 --> 00:37:15,772
I'd put that down if I were you.

464
00:37:18,852 --> 00:37:20,786
That mask works like a bear trap.

465
00:37:22,423 --> 00:37:26,416
Touch it in the wrong place
and the teeth slam shut

466
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:28,428
like so.

467
00:37:28,462 --> 00:37:30,453
(gasps)

468
00:37:30,497 --> 00:37:32,897
Sorry. I had seen it.

469
00:37:32,933 --> 00:37:35,265
I just wanted to touch it for myself.

470
00:37:35,302 --> 00:37:37,532
The teeth on that thing...

471
00:37:37,571 --> 00:37:39,232
they're huge.

472
00:37:39,273 --> 00:37:41,138
Of course they are.

473
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:43,609
The better to bite you with, my dear.

474
00:37:44,878 --> 00:37:48,712
I thought something like this
would be in an evidence locker.

475
00:37:48,749 --> 00:37:50,580
What's it doing here?

476
00:37:50,617 --> 00:37:53,108
An addition to your collection?

477
00:37:53,153 --> 00:37:55,553
I had it sent over for study.

478
00:37:55,589 --> 00:37:59,150
Well, if you understand the outside,

479
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:03,323
you have a better chance
of understanding the inside.

480
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:07,596
But yes yes, it would make
a great addition.

481
00:38:09,803 --> 00:38:13,569
Well, shall we begin?

482
00:38:13,607 --> 00:38:15,302
P.A. Announcer: Unauthorized personnel,

483
00:38:15,342 --> 00:38:18,743
please check in with the security
station to the right. Have a nice day.

484
00:38:18,779 --> 00:38:21,976
I'm sorry, you don't have
clearance to be down here...

485
00:38:24,318 --> 00:38:25,478
Johnny.

486
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:27,783
Hello, Karen. It's good to see you.

487
00:38:27,821 --> 00:38:31,689
Johnny, how are you? It's been so long.

488
00:38:31,725 --> 00:38:34,125
About a year, a year and a half maybe.

489
00:38:34,161 --> 00:38:36,356
I take it you're here to see Jamie.

490
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:39,730
I was hoping to surprise her.

491
00:38:39,767 --> 00:38:41,758
I understand.

492
00:38:41,802 --> 00:38:43,827
Listen,

493
00:38:43,871 --> 00:38:47,136
I am so glad

494
00:38:47,174 --> 00:38:49,404
that the two of you
are giving it another shot.

495
00:38:49,443 --> 00:38:52,139
Between you and me,
she has not been the same

496
00:38:52,179 --> 00:38:54,340
since the two of you separated.

497
00:38:54,381 --> 00:38:56,372
Thanks, Karen.

498
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:59,284
I'm just gonna wander around
until I find her, okay?

499
00:38:59,319 --> 00:39:01,253
Okay. Good luck.

500
00:39:01,288 --> 00:39:02,755
Thanks.

501
00:39:06,126 --> 00:39:08,151
P.A. Announcer: Here at Parker's Asylum

502
00:39:08,195 --> 00:39:09,924
we strive to reach new levels
of commitment

503
00:39:09,963 --> 00:39:12,227
in bringing new methods of treatment
to our patients.

504
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:15,360
- We're in.
- We're in.

505
00:39:17,671 --> 00:39:19,468
And this is?

506
00:39:19,506 --> 00:39:22,134
A gift for helping me on the case.

507
00:39:22,176 --> 00:39:23,666
Merry Christmas.

508
00:39:32,553 --> 00:39:36,512
It's fruit cake... a little joke.

509
00:39:38,192 --> 00:39:41,559
Let's get on, shall we, Miss Garvey?

510
00:39:41,595 --> 00:39:44,155
Fine. I'd like to see my client.
I'd like to see that...

511
00:39:44,198 --> 00:39:45,722
No.

512
00:39:45,766 --> 00:39:47,233
No?

513
00:39:47,267 --> 00:39:49,201
He's just begun a delicate treatment.

514
00:39:49,236 --> 00:39:51,329
It would be a detriment
to interrupt him.

515
00:39:51,371 --> 00:39:54,067
Dr. Parker, forgive me if I sound rude,

516
00:39:54,108 --> 00:39:56,099
but I'm gonna need more than your word.

517
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:58,441
Are you telling me things have changed

518
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:00,947
since the inquests of 1955 and '60

519
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:02,881
regarding the asylum's
mistreatment of patients?

520
00:40:02,916 --> 00:40:04,907
When my father ran this hospital,

521
00:40:04,952 --> 00:40:07,147
psychiatry and the treatment
of the criminally insane

522
00:40:07,187 --> 00:40:08,984
were uncharted territory.

523
00:40:09,022 --> 00:40:11,855
Perhaps some of the treatments
at that time may have seemed radical,

524
00:40:11,892 --> 00:40:13,484
but I can assure you
they were undertaken

525
00:40:13,527 --> 00:40:15,620
with the best interests
of the patients' welfare.

526
00:40:15,662 --> 00:40:19,723
Including the drowning machine?

527
00:40:19,766 --> 00:40:22,701
Aquatic reinforcement.

528
00:40:24,438 --> 00:40:26,770
My father believed in techniques
which utilized

529
00:40:26,807 --> 00:40:28,798
the concept of operant conditioning...

530
00:40:28,842 --> 00:40:30,935
rehabilitation through punishment.

531
00:40:30,978 --> 00:40:32,809
He had built a machine

532
00:40:32,846 --> 00:40:35,041
that submerged a patient in cold water

533
00:40:35,082 --> 00:40:37,414
if they responded or acted out

534
00:40:37,451 --> 00:40:40,852
in an incorrect manner.
But as I said, we've...

535
00:40:40,888 --> 00:40:43,322
we've learned from my father's mistakes.

536
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:45,120
Times have changed.

537
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:47,150
You currently use restraint collars.

538
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:49,321
The possibility for misuse is...

539
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:52,093
Nothing goes on in this facility
that I'm not fully aware of.

540
00:40:52,132 --> 00:40:55,226
You have to remember we're dealing
with dangerous offenders.

541
00:40:55,269 --> 00:40:57,863
Precautions have to be taken.

542
00:40:57,905 --> 00:41:01,068
Then I'm sure you wouldn't mind
if I take a quick peek

543
00:41:01,108 --> 00:41:03,099
at the living conditions of my client.

544
00:41:03,143 --> 00:41:04,940
No offense, Miss Garvey,

545
00:41:04,978 --> 00:41:08,744
but the reason Mr. Grierson is not
in the electric chair right now

546
00:41:08,782 --> 00:41:10,477
is because of me,

547
00:41:10,517 --> 00:41:12,781
no matter how good you look
in the business suit.

548
00:41:12,819 --> 00:41:13,979
Well...

549
00:41:14,021 --> 00:41:16,922
If the next words out of your mouth
are not "Thank you and goodbye,"

550
00:41:16,957 --> 00:41:18,254
I'm not interested.

551
00:41:18,292 --> 00:41:21,352
I run this facility
and I make the rules.

552
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:23,693
And you can just get used to it.

553
00:41:24,998 --> 00:41:28,490
And don't pout when you don't get
what you want.

554
00:41:28,535 --> 00:41:31,129
It's not becoming.

555
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:35,405
Carl.

556
00:41:35,442 --> 00:41:36,841
Sir?

557
00:41:36,877 --> 00:41:39,744
Have Dr. Morgan give Miss Garvey
a tour of the facility

558
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:43,443
and then escort her off the grounds.

559
00:41:46,486 --> 00:41:49,080
(P.A. Announcer speaking)

560
00:41:49,122 --> 00:41:52,148
Only doctors should engage
in personal discussion.

561
00:41:52,192 --> 00:41:54,524
Johnny: This is the one.

562
00:41:54,561 --> 00:41:56,722
This is it?

563
00:41:56,763 --> 00:41:58,196
Yeah.

564
00:41:59,466 --> 00:42:01,400
And how are you planning on getting in?

565
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:05,101
You stole it from Jamie?

566
00:42:05,138 --> 00:42:06,332
Borrowed.

567
00:42:08,375 --> 00:42:10,639
And I guess you know
the pass code too, right?

568
00:42:10,677 --> 00:42:13,043
If she hasn't changed it.

569
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,071
- (buzzes)
- Male voice: Access granted.

570
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:16,480
Sometimes I hate you.

571
00:42:30,998 --> 00:42:35,196
Dr. Morgan, are you sure
you can't let me see Mr. Grierson?

572
00:42:35,235 --> 00:42:37,567
You know I can't.

573
00:42:37,604 --> 00:42:40,767
You know, I saw your husband
almost every day in court.

574
00:42:40,807 --> 00:42:43,139
It must be really hard on him

575
00:42:43,176 --> 00:42:45,201
knowing that his sister's killer

576
00:42:45,245 --> 00:42:47,406
is just a few feet away from his wife.

577
00:42:47,447 --> 00:42:49,574
(beeps)

578
00:42:49,616 --> 00:42:52,278
- We're not together anymore.
- Male voice: Access granted.

579
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:53,946
Sorry to hear that.

580
00:42:55,756 --> 00:42:57,747
(buzzes)

581
00:42:57,791 --> 00:42:59,952
Have a nice day, Miss Garvey.

582
00:42:59,993 --> 00:43:02,018
I'm sure you know your way out.

583
00:43:22,416 --> 00:43:24,782
You gave me this, remember?

584
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:30,181
Yeah, and I gave you that.

585
00:43:30,223 --> 00:43:33,158
But we're not even close to being even.

586
00:43:37,464 --> 00:43:38,863
It's okay.

587
00:43:38,899 --> 00:43:41,595
I just want to talk.

588
00:43:41,635 --> 00:43:44,001
And since you can't talk,

589
00:43:44,037 --> 00:43:47,370
this is gonna be a little one-sided.

590
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:52,176
Do you remember her?

591
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:06,424
You killed my sister,
you son of a bitch.

592
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:09,987
Not so tough
without your costume, are you?

593
00:44:16,603 --> 00:44:18,594
P.A. Announcer: Attention all staff,

594
00:44:18,638 --> 00:44:21,300
Dr. Morgan, please report
to Harold Grierson's cell immediately.

595
00:44:21,341 --> 00:44:24,105
Dr. Jamie Morgan
to cell 22A immediately.

596
00:44:24,144 --> 00:44:25,304
Thank you.

597
00:44:25,345 --> 00:44:28,405
We've got to get out of here.
Johnny, you heard the...

598
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:36,723
What the hell are you doing?

599
00:44:38,024 --> 00:44:40,117
Mind your business, Pete.

600
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,891
Johnny, you said you wanted some time
to make him sing.

601
00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:45,591
He's not singing.

602
00:44:45,632 --> 00:44:48,658
Sure he is. He just don't know the tune.

603
00:44:48,702 --> 00:44:50,465
I'm sorry, but I can't let you do this.

604
00:44:53,306 --> 00:44:55,866
Yes, you can.

605
00:44:55,909 --> 00:44:58,207
Let me do this.

606
00:44:58,245 --> 00:44:59,542
Johnny.

607
00:44:59,579 --> 00:45:01,376
You know why we came, Pete.

608
00:45:01,415 --> 00:45:03,212
You can pretend like you don't,

609
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:05,718
but you do.

610
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,314
Let me do this, Pete.

611
00:45:10,757 --> 00:45:12,884
I figured if I was gonna do
something crazy,

612
00:45:12,926 --> 00:45:15,554
this would be the place.

613
00:45:18,131 --> 00:45:20,258
What are you gonna do?

614
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,268
- (door buzzes)
- Male voice: Access granted.

615
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:24,293
God damn it. (uncocks gun)

616
00:45:26,139 --> 00:45:28,505
Johnny?

617
00:45:30,677 --> 00:45:33,407
What the hell are you guys doing here?

618
00:45:33,447 --> 00:45:35,745
Surprise.

619
00:45:37,284 --> 00:45:39,684
Back to your corner, Harold, now.

620
00:45:43,156 --> 00:45:46,922
Come on, we're gonna get you
out of here before D...

621
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,257
Dr. Parker.

622
00:45:49,629 --> 00:45:52,029
I'm surprised to see you here, Johnny.

623
00:45:52,065 --> 00:45:53,930
Johnny: Well, I was just
in the neighborhood

624
00:45:53,967 --> 00:45:56,367
and I decided to drop by personally
and thank you

625
00:45:56,403 --> 00:45:58,564
for all your tremendous
insight at the trial.

626
00:45:58,605 --> 00:46:01,870
You don't think a man who dresses
as a wolf has psychological problems?

627
00:46:01,908 --> 00:46:03,933
Not my call to make.

628
00:46:03,977 --> 00:46:05,638
No, it's not.

629
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:08,739
I can appreciate
your emotional predicament.

630
00:46:08,782 --> 00:46:12,013
Johnny Morgan, age five,
witnesses the death of his sister

631
00:46:12,052 --> 00:46:13,986
at the hands of a costumed killer;

632
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:16,318
age six through 16... a problem child,

633
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:18,620
moves from school to school;

634
00:46:18,658 --> 00:46:20,649
age 18, he finds a purpose,

635
00:46:20,694 --> 00:46:23,754
find Jesus, studies to be a cop;

636
00:46:23,797 --> 00:46:25,765
age 25, he's top of the class,

637
00:46:25,799 --> 00:46:28,563
becomes a detective,
hoping to make a difference.

638
00:46:28,602 --> 00:46:31,002
Shortly thereafter
his sister's killer reappears

639
00:46:31,037 --> 00:46:32,504
and kills his partner.

640
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:34,439
How am I doing?

641
00:46:34,474 --> 00:46:36,135
You flatter me.

642
00:46:36,176 --> 00:46:38,110
Let's just say I could write a book

643
00:46:38,144 --> 00:46:40,135
about a boy who has the opportunity

644
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:42,740
to kill his childhood demon and fails.

645
00:46:42,782 --> 00:46:45,751
Of course it would be
a very short book, but nevertheless...

646
00:46:45,785 --> 00:46:48,413
The night's still young, Bob.

647
00:46:48,455 --> 00:46:50,446
Listen to me, son.

648
00:46:50,490 --> 00:46:53,254
I let you play your little game
in there, but your fun's over.

649
00:46:53,293 --> 00:46:55,955
The only reason I'm not having you
hauled out of here in handcuffs

650
00:46:55,996 --> 00:46:57,964
is because it would be
an embarrassment to this institution

651
00:46:57,998 --> 00:46:59,488
and damage its reputation,

652
00:46:59,533 --> 00:47:02,627
not to mention the reputation
of its lead doctor.

653
00:47:02,669 --> 00:47:05,536
I assume you still care
what happens to her.

654
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:08,097
I mean, someone has to,

655
00:47:08,141 --> 00:47:11,838
what with you obsessing
about the past and all.

656
00:47:15,282 --> 00:47:16,943
I assume I can count on you

657
00:47:16,983 --> 00:47:19,178
to make sure he doesn't cause
any more trouble.

658
00:47:19,219 --> 00:47:21,517
Yes.

659
00:47:28,562 --> 00:47:30,757
Hey Jamie.

660
00:47:30,797 --> 00:47:33,095
Pete.

661
00:47:33,133 --> 00:47:37,035
Jesus, Johnny, he could have
had you arrested for this.

662
00:47:37,070 --> 00:47:38,867
You stole my ID card.

663
00:47:38,905 --> 00:47:42,238
Do you have anything
to say for yourself at all?

664
00:47:42,275 --> 00:47:44,709
You're not wearing our wedding ring.

665
00:47:44,744 --> 00:47:46,735
What?

666
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,645
Our wedding ring...

667
00:47:48,682 --> 00:47:51,879
you're not wearing it.

668
00:47:55,855 --> 00:47:58,050
We're not together anymore, Johnny.

669
00:47:58,091 --> 00:47:59,991
We're...

670
00:48:02,195 --> 00:48:04,356
I kept your name.

671
00:48:06,166 --> 00:48:07,690
Yeah.

672
00:48:09,302 --> 00:48:11,270
Look,

673
00:48:11,304 --> 00:48:14,137
I know this has been tough on you.
If you want to talk, we can...

674
00:48:14,174 --> 00:48:16,734
Don't. Don't do that.

675
00:48:16,776 --> 00:48:19,267
I'm not one of your patients.

676
00:48:19,312 --> 00:48:22,440
That's not what I meant.

677
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:24,279
If you want to stick around,

678
00:48:24,317 --> 00:48:26,842
we can hang out
after my session with Mabel.

679
00:48:28,555 --> 00:48:30,113
Sure.

680
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,853
What about you, Pete?

681
00:48:35,895 --> 00:48:38,386
Point me in the direction
of the kitchen and I would.

682
00:48:38,431 --> 00:48:41,366
P.A. Announcer: Although security
remains foremost in the minds of staff,

683
00:48:41,401 --> 00:48:44,598
- So how have you been?
...the well-being of the patients...

684
00:48:44,638 --> 00:48:46,469
Good.

685
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:50,374
I've been okay. You?

686
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:52,401
Okay.

687
00:48:52,445 --> 00:48:55,505
Hey, you two. Johnny,
I have been looking all over for you.

688
00:48:55,548 --> 00:48:57,277
You just disappeared on me.

689
00:48:57,317 --> 00:49:00,286
Yeah, sorry about that.

690
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:04,051
Listen, Dr. Parker said
that he is not going to be able

691
00:49:04,090 --> 00:49:06,217
to see Sabrina after all today.

692
00:49:06,259 --> 00:49:08,819
And I don't know what to do.
We still have that session with Mabel.

693
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:11,387
Don't worry about it, Karen.
We'll figure something out.

694
00:49:11,431 --> 00:49:13,490
I can look after her.

695
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:14,761
You will?

696
00:49:14,801 --> 00:49:17,031
I'm here.

697
00:49:17,070 --> 00:49:19,732
You might as well put me to some use.

698
00:49:19,773 --> 00:49:22,173
She doesn't talk very much.

699
00:49:22,208 --> 00:49:24,870
That's okay. Neither do I.

700
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:27,744
Okay, listen, sweetheart.

701
00:49:27,781 --> 00:49:31,512
Now you be a good girl
and you listen to Mr. Morgan.

702
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:33,542
And I'll see you real soon, hmm?

703
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:37,216
(laughs)

704
00:49:37,257 --> 00:49:39,817
You little sneak...

705
00:49:39,859 --> 00:49:41,884
taking my earring. When did you do that?

706
00:49:41,928 --> 00:49:43,793
Thank you.

707
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,992
Now you be good. Promise?

708
00:49:51,171 --> 00:49:52,399
Both of you.

709
00:50:05,351 --> 00:50:09,048
So that was cool of Santa
to give you his hat, right?

710
00:50:59,305 --> 00:51:01,773
# Dear Santa #

711
00:51:01,808 --> 00:51:06,472
# I'm writing this letter #

712
00:51:08,481 --> 00:51:10,540
# To ask... #

713
00:51:10,583 --> 00:51:14,781
- My mama's dead.
- #... a favor of you #

714
00:51:14,821 --> 00:51:17,483
I'm sorry.

715
00:51:17,524 --> 00:51:20,118
Sabrina: It's okay.

716
00:51:21,728 --> 00:51:24,094
I don't remember her all that well.

717
00:51:25,865 --> 00:51:28,561
I don't like to.

718
00:51:28,601 --> 00:51:31,934
It hurts, you know?

719
00:51:49,889 --> 00:51:52,483
P.A. Announcer: A reminder
that every Tuesday

720
00:51:52,525 --> 00:51:56,825
cleaning of cell blocks 5 and 15
will commence.

721
00:51:56,863 --> 00:51:58,091
Please make the ne...

722
00:52:14,781 --> 00:52:16,806
Johnny.

723
00:52:16,850 --> 00:52:18,442
Nothing to worry about.

724
00:52:18,484 --> 00:52:20,782
I'm sure the power is gonna be
back on in no time.

725
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,985
You want to hold the flashlight?

726
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:36,300
Miss Garvey.

727
00:52:36,336 --> 00:52:38,327
Excuse me.

728
00:52:38,371 --> 00:52:39,861
What are you doing still here?

729
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:41,897
Wrong turn.

730
00:52:41,941 --> 00:52:45,399
Unlikely. Regardless,
I don't have time for this.

731
00:52:45,445 --> 00:52:47,777
Does this happen often?

732
00:52:47,814 --> 00:52:49,679
The whole asylum is in lockdown.

733
00:52:49,716 --> 00:52:51,946
It happens whenever
there is a power failure.

734
00:52:51,985 --> 00:52:54,579
It's a safety precaution.
No one gets in or out.

735
00:52:54,621 --> 00:52:56,111
What do we do?

736
00:52:56,155 --> 00:52:58,146
We flip the switch and reset the system.

737
00:52:58,191 --> 00:53:00,785
If you want to make yourself useful,

738
00:53:00,827 --> 00:53:03,421
you can give me a hand.

739
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:17,136
We should probably check to see
if Dr. Parker's okay.

740
00:53:17,176 --> 00:53:20,111
Everybody calm down. I'm sure
the lights will be back up in no time.

741
00:53:20,146 --> 00:53:23,707
Sabrina. Oh, sweetheart.

742
00:53:26,753 --> 00:53:28,880
Were you scared?

743
00:53:33,393 --> 00:53:35,657
Why isn't the power turned back on?

744
00:53:35,695 --> 00:53:37,287
I'm not sure.

745
00:53:42,268 --> 00:53:45,237
There's the emergency lights now.

746
00:53:45,271 --> 00:53:47,296
(water dripping)

747
00:53:49,943 --> 00:53:52,036
Here, hold this.

748
00:53:58,384 --> 00:54:00,011
There we go.

749
00:54:00,053 --> 00:54:02,487
And voilà.

750
00:54:03,589 --> 00:54:05,580
And voilà what?

751
00:54:08,528 --> 00:54:10,655
Wait for it.

752
00:54:10,697 --> 00:54:13,097
(beeping)

753
00:54:17,503 --> 00:54:18,936
P.A. Announcer: Scheduling.

754
00:54:18,972 --> 00:54:22,237
We would like to wish you
and safe and happy...

755
00:54:22,275 --> 00:54:24,266
system error code 1.

756
00:54:24,310 --> 00:54:25,971
Jamie: Now listen carefully.

757
00:54:26,012 --> 00:54:28,742
I'm sure the patients are a little
frightened by the power outage,

758
00:54:28,781 --> 00:54:31,579
so be extra calm and speak...

759
00:54:31,617 --> 00:54:33,983
P.A. Announcer: Temperature gauge...
was founded in 1929...

760
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:35,510
Good morning.

761
00:54:35,555 --> 00:54:37,614
Cell door unlocking.

762
00:54:37,657 --> 00:54:39,716
- Jamie: You have to remember...
- Hey Jamie.

763
00:54:39,759 --> 00:54:41,920
- (doors buzzing)
- P.A. Announcer: Unlocking. Unlocking.

764
00:54:41,961 --> 00:54:44,725
- Listen.
- Unlocking. Unlocking. Unlocking.

765
00:54:44,764 --> 00:54:47,494
- (doors buzzing)
- Unlocking. Unlocking...

766
00:54:51,304 --> 00:54:54,137
Oh my God.

767
00:54:56,909 --> 00:54:58,570
P.A. Announcer: System restored.

768
00:54:58,611 --> 00:55:00,602
Everybody just stay quiet for a second.

769
00:55:00,646 --> 00:55:03,308
P.A. Announcer: Please do not panic.
The asylum is in lockdown.

770
00:55:03,349 --> 00:55:04,646
Something's beeping.

771
00:55:04,684 --> 00:55:06,675
P.A. Announcer: Find safe quarters
and wait for assistance

772
00:55:06,719 --> 00:55:09,188
from the local authorities.

773
00:55:09,188 --> 00:55:11,315
- (Benny growling)
- (pounding)

774
00:55:17,016 --> 00:55:20,543
(roaring)

775
00:55:25,458 --> 00:55:27,221
I got it.

776
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:30,525
(rapid beeping)

777
00:55:30,563 --> 00:55:33,760
Okay, we do it your way.

778
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:35,734
But I hope you know what you're doing.

779
00:55:39,105 --> 00:55:42,074
P.A. Announcer: Please do not panic.
The asylum is in lockdown.

780
00:55:42,108 --> 00:55:43,598
Find safe quarters

781
00:55:43,643 --> 00:55:46,043
and wait for assistance
from the local authorities.

782
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:50,209
Benny, I need you to listen
to my voice, okay?

783
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:51,945
(growling)

784
00:55:51,985 --> 00:55:54,419
# Fais dodo #

785
00:55:54,454 --> 00:55:56,183
# Colas mon... #

786
00:55:56,222 --> 00:55:57,780
(roaring)

787
00:55:59,259 --> 00:56:00,783
No?

788
00:56:00,827 --> 00:56:02,260
Okay.

789
00:56:03,563 --> 00:56:07,090
Marty, don't move.

790
00:56:12,071 --> 00:56:14,437
(slower beeping)

791
00:56:19,646 --> 00:56:21,773
Sabrina, where are you?

792
00:56:30,323 --> 00:56:32,655
(screaming)

793
00:56:32,692 --> 00:56:34,751
(roaring)

794
00:56:34,794 --> 00:56:35,954
Benny, no.

795
00:56:44,504 --> 00:56:47,337
If you don't tell me exactly what's
going on, I'm calling the police.

796
00:56:47,373 --> 00:56:49,841
Don't bother.
We're separated by 8' of rock.

797
00:56:49,876 --> 00:56:52,310
There's a landline in my office.

798
00:56:52,345 --> 00:56:54,176
(distant roaring)

799
00:56:54,214 --> 00:56:55,943
What was that?

800
00:56:55,982 --> 00:56:58,542
Come with me
and stay away from the doors.

801
00:56:58,585 --> 00:57:00,553
Why do I need to stay away from the...?

802
00:57:00,587 --> 00:57:02,111
(screams)

803
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:09,557
That's why you stay away from doors

804
00:57:09,596 --> 00:57:11,689
and that's why we have
proximity collars.

805
00:57:22,575 --> 00:57:24,543
Hey, little chicken,

806
00:57:24,577 --> 00:57:26,340
Chicken Little.

807
00:57:27,547 --> 00:57:30,641
All right, young, tender fried chicken.

808
00:57:30,683 --> 00:57:33,948
I'm going to chicken-finger-fry you.

809
00:57:45,531 --> 00:57:47,829
Hey there, little one.

810
00:57:49,936 --> 00:57:51,597
Are you okay?

811
00:57:52,672 --> 00:57:56,904
This bad man is not gonna
hurt you anymore.

812
00:57:59,746 --> 00:58:03,079
I'm going to the kitchen. Want to come?

813
00:58:04,584 --> 00:58:07,712
Well, come on.

814
00:58:07,754 --> 00:58:10,314
I'm famished.

815
00:58:12,525 --> 00:58:14,755
- Hey, stay with us. Stay with us.
- What happened?

816
00:58:14,794 --> 00:58:16,352
What happened? What happened?

817
00:58:16,396 --> 00:58:18,796
Do you know your way
around here in the dark?

818
00:58:18,831 --> 00:58:20,731
Yeah. Why?

819
00:58:20,767 --> 00:58:22,997
I need you to take me
to the Wolf's cell.

820
00:58:23,036 --> 00:58:25,402
Why would I do that?
Why would I do that?

821
00:58:25,438 --> 00:58:28,771
Because I need to make sure
he's still there or that he's not.

822
00:58:28,808 --> 00:58:31,242
Why me? Why not him?

823
00:58:31,277 --> 00:58:34,246
He knows his way around here
just as well as I do, so...

824
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:37,306
You, Pete, walk with me.

825
00:58:37,350 --> 00:58:40,342
Do you have any weapons that we can
use to round up the patients?

826
00:58:40,386 --> 00:58:43,878
No, all we have is these tranquilizer
guns in case Benny ever got loose.

827
00:58:43,923 --> 00:58:46,619
They're supposed to have enough sedative
to take down a large animal.

828
00:58:46,659 --> 00:58:49,321
One hit him in the neck
and he didn't go down.

829
00:58:49,362 --> 00:58:52,229
Maybe he's a bigger animal
than you thought.

830
00:58:52,265 --> 00:58:56,133
(P.A. Chatter)

831
00:58:56,169 --> 00:58:58,000
You know how to use this?

832
00:58:58,037 --> 00:58:59,937
Good. Don't be afraid to.

833
00:58:59,972 --> 00:59:02,099
I want you to split up into teams of two

834
00:59:02,141 --> 00:59:04,041
and find that girl.

835
00:59:04,077 --> 00:59:06,637
She's gone, Jamie.

836
00:59:06,679 --> 00:59:08,237
She's gone.

837
00:59:08,281 --> 00:59:09,612
She'll be okay, Karen.

838
00:59:09,649 --> 00:59:11,446
Karen: I looked all over for her.

839
00:59:11,484 --> 00:59:13,418
I can't find her anywhere.

840
00:59:13,453 --> 00:59:15,444
I can't even think about that.

841
00:59:15,488 --> 00:59:17,183
What about you, Johnny?

842
00:59:17,223 --> 00:59:19,350
We'll be fine.

843
00:59:19,392 --> 00:59:21,257
Everything's gonna be fine.

844
00:59:21,294 --> 00:59:23,285
You take care of her, okay?

845
00:59:48,388 --> 00:59:51,152
(beeping)

846
00:59:51,190 --> 00:59:54,284
Sabrina. Sabrina.

847
00:59:54,327 --> 00:59:55,988
Sabrina.

848
00:59:56,996 --> 01:00:00,056
Sabrina.

849
01:00:00,099 --> 01:00:02,897
We should split up like Johnny said.

850
01:00:02,935 --> 01:00:04,926
That's a good idea.

851
01:00:04,971 --> 01:00:07,838
Pete and I will go this way.
And you and Greg go that way.

852
01:00:07,874 --> 01:00:10,843
Do you still have your proximity box?

853
01:00:10,877 --> 01:00:13,072
Good. Be ready to use it.

854
01:00:13,112 --> 01:00:16,479
Just stick together
and we'll all be fine.

855
01:00:19,152 --> 01:00:21,950
Karen, we're going to find her.

856
01:00:21,988 --> 01:00:24,479
I know.

857
01:00:27,994 --> 01:00:29,985
Jamie: Sabrina.

858
01:00:30,029 --> 01:00:33,157
Sabrina. Sabrina.

859
01:00:33,199 --> 01:00:34,598
Sabrina.

860
01:00:34,634 --> 01:00:36,295
P.A. Announcer:
The asylum is in lockdown.

861
01:00:36,335 --> 01:00:37,529
Sabrina.

862
01:00:37,570 --> 01:00:39,538
P.A. Announcer:
Please find safe quarters

863
01:00:39,572 --> 01:00:41,972
and wait for assistance
from the local authorities.

864
01:01:01,394 --> 01:01:04,124
P.A. Announcer:
The asylum is in lockdown.

865
01:01:04,163 --> 01:01:06,097
Find safe quarters

866
01:01:06,132 --> 01:01:08,828
and wait for assistance
from the local authorities.

867
01:01:17,210 --> 01:01:19,508
I don't see anything.

868
01:01:19,545 --> 01:01:20,978
(grunts)

869
01:01:30,590 --> 01:01:32,888
I'm getting help. I'm getting help.

870
01:01:35,394 --> 01:01:37,419
Round two, you bastard.

871
01:01:42,668 --> 01:01:44,932
Who the hell are you?

872
01:01:44,971 --> 01:01:47,599
I'm the hand of God.

873
01:01:49,375 --> 01:01:51,275
I came for ye

874
01:01:51,310 --> 01:01:53,540
who bathed in the blood
of the innocents.

875
01:01:55,615 --> 01:01:57,674
You came for the Wolf?

876
01:02:00,052 --> 01:02:02,350
Yes.

877
01:02:04,090 --> 01:02:06,388
And you found me...

878
01:02:06,425 --> 01:02:08,450
honest mistake.

879
01:02:10,162 --> 01:02:12,460
I'm willing to overlook
the whole choking bit

880
01:02:12,498 --> 01:02:14,056
and turn the other cheek.

881
01:02:16,903 --> 01:02:19,804
You're no better...

882
01:02:19,839 --> 01:02:22,774
a sinner just like the Wolf.

883
01:02:23,943 --> 01:02:26,070
Take it back.

884
01:02:26,112 --> 01:02:29,104
Soon I will bathe in your pagan blood

885
01:02:29,148 --> 01:02:30,979
for I am the instrument

886
01:02:31,017 --> 01:02:35,852
of the almighty and righteous Lord God,

887
01:02:35,888 --> 01:02:37,947
He who...

888
01:02:43,429 --> 01:02:45,090
I will kill you.

889
01:02:58,077 --> 01:03:01,740
The hand of God is absolute

890
01:03:01,781 --> 01:03:03,612
and just.

891
01:03:26,572 --> 01:03:28,335
My God.

892
01:03:28,374 --> 01:03:30,342
Yeah.

893
01:03:30,376 --> 01:03:32,037
Sit down.

894
01:03:43,089 --> 01:03:45,023
Please.

895
01:03:46,359 --> 01:03:50,386
Please mercy.

896
01:03:50,429 --> 01:03:53,057
There is no mercy here.

897
01:03:56,736 --> 01:03:59,534
Sabrina, Sabrina, are you in there?

898
01:04:04,010 --> 01:04:05,500
Sabrina.

899
01:04:16,989 --> 01:04:20,254
(rustling)

900
01:04:31,971 --> 01:04:33,495
Greg.

901
01:04:35,041 --> 01:04:37,475
Greg, is that you?

902
01:05:03,269 --> 01:05:05,294
Oh my God.

903
01:05:07,907 --> 01:05:09,898
(pounding)

904
01:05:09,942 --> 01:05:11,544
Man on radio: # O Come... #

905
01:05:11,544 --> 01:05:12,067
Man on radio: # O Come... #

906
01:05:12,111 --> 01:05:14,841
(Mabel singing along)
# All ye faithful #

907
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:19,146
# Joyful and triumphant #

908
01:05:19,185 --> 01:05:23,849
# O come ye, O come ye #

909
01:05:23,889 --> 01:05:26,084
# To Bethlehem... #

910
01:05:26,125 --> 01:05:27,422
(whispers) Jamie.

911
01:05:29,528 --> 01:05:30,859
It's okay.

912
01:05:30,896 --> 01:05:34,627
# Come and behold Him #

913
01:05:34,667 --> 01:05:39,263
# Born the King of angels #

914
01:05:39,305 --> 01:05:43,765
# O come, let us adore Him #

915
01:05:43,809 --> 01:05:45,800
# O come #

916
01:05:45,845 --> 01:05:48,973
# Let us adore Him #

917
01:05:49,014 --> 01:05:51,778
# O come, let us #

918
01:05:51,817 --> 01:05:55,309
# Adore Him #

919
01:05:55,354 --> 01:06:00,587
# Christ the Lord #

920
01:06:00,626 --> 01:06:02,890
# Adeste... #

921
01:06:02,928 --> 01:06:04,919
- (dish clatters)
- (Mabel stops singing)

922
01:06:04,964 --> 01:06:06,989
(radio continues) # Fideles #

923
01:06:07,032 --> 01:06:09,125
# Laeti triumphantes... #

924
01:06:09,168 --> 01:06:12,569
Mabel, it's Jamie.

925
01:06:12,605 --> 01:06:15,073
Go back to your room.

926
01:06:15,107 --> 01:06:18,008
I don't want to hurt you.

927
01:06:18,043 --> 01:06:20,011
Mabel?

928
01:06:22,181 --> 01:06:24,206
Drop the gun.

929
01:06:27,353 --> 01:06:32,222
Dr. Morgan, so good of you to come.

930
01:06:35,895 --> 01:06:38,125
Please don't kill me.

931
01:06:38,164 --> 01:06:39,995
Shh.

932
01:06:40,032 --> 01:06:41,556
It's okay.

933
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:43,465
I'm not one of the crazies.

934
01:06:43,502 --> 01:06:45,766
You scared the crap out of me.

935
01:06:45,805 --> 01:06:47,466
Johnny Morgan?

936
01:06:47,506 --> 01:06:48,837
Yeah.

937
01:06:50,242 --> 01:06:52,301
Oh, it's you.

938
01:06:52,344 --> 01:06:54,778
- Small world.
- Small world.

939
01:06:54,814 --> 01:06:57,715
I'm just here checking on my client
and making sure he's okay.

940
01:06:57,750 --> 01:06:59,411
What a coincidence.

941
01:06:59,451 --> 01:07:01,385
I was just gonna go
check on your client.

942
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:03,183
And you know where his cell is?

943
01:07:03,222 --> 01:07:05,281
Yeah, but he's not there.

944
01:07:05,324 --> 01:07:07,724
He's not in his cell?

945
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:10,228
And how does that make you feel?

946
01:07:10,262 --> 01:07:12,730
Better or worse?

947
01:07:12,765 --> 01:07:14,255
That's not fair.

948
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:16,097
I thoroughly researched this case.

949
01:07:16,135 --> 01:07:19,298
There is no physical evidence
linking Grierson to your sister.

950
01:07:19,338 --> 01:07:22,000
Listen, there's an eight-year-old girl
down here somewhere

951
01:07:22,041 --> 01:07:23,770
and so is he.

952
01:07:23,809 --> 01:07:26,175
I'm not willing to give your client
the benefit of the doubt.

953
01:07:31,684 --> 01:07:33,083
Oh God.

954
01:07:35,554 --> 01:07:37,545
Run.

955
01:07:41,260 --> 01:07:43,091
I don't want any trouble.

956
01:08:03,415 --> 01:08:04,575
Oh shit.

957
01:08:16,795 --> 01:08:19,423
Dr. Morgan, would you be a doll

958
01:08:19,465 --> 01:08:23,299
and drop your little gadget
into that pot of water, please?

959
01:08:23,335 --> 01:08:27,101
Mabel, you don't want to do this.

960
01:08:27,139 --> 01:08:31,075
Oh, I'm pretty sure I do.

961
01:08:31,110 --> 01:08:33,135
Mabel, please.

962
01:08:33,178 --> 01:08:34,338
Do it.

963
01:08:34,380 --> 01:08:36,712
Okay.

964
01:08:42,421 --> 01:08:44,286
Okay.

965
01:08:44,323 --> 01:08:46,484
I did what you asked.

966
01:08:46,525 --> 01:08:49,858
Now let him go.

967
01:08:49,895 --> 01:08:52,659
This isn't your husband, is it, Jamie?

968
01:08:54,266 --> 01:08:55,494
No.

969
01:08:55,534 --> 01:08:57,195
Good.

970
01:08:57,236 --> 01:08:58,828
No!

971
01:08:59,872 --> 01:09:02,067
Girls' night!

972
01:09:02,107 --> 01:09:05,474
This is everything
I ever wanted, Jamie...

973
01:09:05,511 --> 01:09:10,210
just you and me,
two gals alone in the kitchen,

974
01:09:10,249 --> 01:09:12,809
cooking up a storm.

975
01:09:12,851 --> 01:09:15,149
Mabel,

976
01:09:15,187 --> 01:09:17,485
what have you done?

977
01:09:17,523 --> 01:09:18,956
Oh, let's get started.

978
01:09:18,991 --> 01:09:20,253
Male voice: Override lock.

985
01:09:32,671 --> 01:09:34,935
(grunts)

986
01:09:34,974 --> 01:09:37,670
Please find safe quarters
and wait for assistance.

987
01:09:37,710 --> 01:09:40,508
How many fire codes is this violating?

988
01:10:02,234 --> 01:10:04,498
I see you've removed your collar.

989
01:10:04,536 --> 01:10:08,097
You're smarter than I thought you were.

990
01:10:09,775 --> 01:10:11,936
Shall we end this now?

991
01:10:15,814 --> 01:10:18,180
P.A. Announcer: In the event
of a medical emergency

992
01:10:18,217 --> 01:10:20,378
or if you require assistance

993
01:10:20,419 --> 01:10:22,614
staff members can be recognized

994
01:10:22,654 --> 01:10:25,350
by photo identification badges.

995
01:10:25,391 --> 01:10:29,293
Although security remains foremost
in the minds of staff at Parker's,

996
01:10:29,328 --> 01:10:32,195
the well-being of the patients
is second to none.

997
01:10:35,134 --> 01:10:36,795
What the...?

998
01:10:38,871 --> 01:10:41,066
(coughing)

999
01:10:41,106 --> 01:10:44,269
Fuck.

1000
01:10:44,309 --> 01:10:46,777
Damn it.

1001
01:10:53,919 --> 01:10:56,547
I'm only gonna take one...

1002
01:10:56,588 --> 01:10:59,716
just one, only one.

1003
01:10:59,758 --> 01:11:02,454
- Get the hell away from me.
- But I only need one...

1004
01:11:02,494 --> 01:11:05,156
just one toe.

1005
01:11:05,197 --> 01:11:07,665
Oh, Jamie told me about you.

1006
01:11:07,699 --> 01:11:10,190
The blood is traveling to your head...

1007
01:11:10,235 --> 01:11:12,897
leaves less blood in your feet.

1008
01:11:12,938 --> 01:11:16,374
Won't hurt as much. Won't be as messy.

1009
01:11:16,408 --> 01:11:20,435
If you even look at my feet,

1010
01:11:20,479 --> 01:11:21,639
I will kill you.

1011
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:24,012
I was only gonna take one...

1012
01:11:24,049 --> 01:11:27,576
the second from the last.
You wouldn't miss it.

1013
01:11:27,619 --> 01:11:31,077
I know it's not needed for balance

1014
01:11:31,123 --> 01:11:33,114
or stability.

1015
01:11:33,158 --> 01:11:35,456
It's not needed for anything really.

1016
01:11:35,494 --> 01:11:38,588
It's the little piggy who had none.

1017
01:11:38,630 --> 01:11:42,930
It's just not important.

1018
01:11:46,738 --> 01:11:49,605
They're all important.

1019
01:11:51,076 --> 01:11:53,340
Let me down.

1020
01:11:53,378 --> 01:11:54,538
Okay.

1021
01:11:55,547 --> 01:11:56,707
(exclaims)

1022
01:12:06,992 --> 01:12:08,892
Where did you get that hat?

1023
01:12:08,927 --> 01:12:11,361
The kitchen.

1024
01:12:13,031 --> 01:12:16,762
The same place I got these.

1025
01:12:18,070 --> 01:12:19,401
The kitchen.

1026
01:12:19,438 --> 01:12:21,838
They're leftovers.

1027
01:12:21,874 --> 01:12:23,034
Leftovers?

1028
01:12:23,075 --> 01:12:25,475
Yeah. They...

1029
01:12:25,511 --> 01:12:28,503
they won't be needing them anymore.

1030
01:12:28,547 --> 01:12:31,744
No. Mabel.

1031
01:12:31,783 --> 01:12:34,843
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

1032
01:12:34,887 --> 01:12:37,651
Don't think I'm done with you.

1033
01:12:40,259 --> 01:12:42,284
Sorry.

1034
01:12:44,796 --> 01:12:47,287
Now, Jamie, the trick is

1035
01:12:47,332 --> 01:12:49,425
to gut them while they're still fresh.

1036
01:12:49,468 --> 01:12:51,197
Now I know some people would disagree,

1037
01:12:51,236 --> 01:12:52,863
but that's the way I like to do it.

1038
01:12:52,905 --> 01:12:56,102
And you can maximize the amount of meat
you can freeze for later.

1039
01:12:56,141 --> 01:13:00,578
Now the next step is
to take off the head just like a fish.

1040
01:13:02,181 --> 01:13:03,512
(head thuds)

1041
01:13:03,549 --> 01:13:05,517
We'll get the eyes later.

1042
01:13:05,551 --> 01:13:08,486
Mm, they're such a delicacy.

1043
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:10,511
Now then

1044
01:13:10,556 --> 01:13:12,956
you take a sharp cutting knife like this

1045
01:13:12,991 --> 01:13:14,982
and you pierce the flesh

1046
01:13:15,027 --> 01:13:17,552
just under the ribcage.

1047
01:13:17,596 --> 01:13:20,895
Here, I like to call this
a gutting knife...

1048
01:13:20,933 --> 01:13:23,424
you know, cutting knife... gutting knife.

1049
01:13:23,468 --> 01:13:26,995
Anyway, so then you make a straight line

1050
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:29,439
down from the abdomen

1051
01:13:29,474 --> 01:13:33,877
just... just above his wee-wee.

1052
01:13:33,912 --> 01:13:37,712
Ooh, looks like he's been cut before.

1053
01:13:37,749 --> 01:13:38,977
(giggles)

1054
01:13:39,017 --> 01:13:41,383
Oh, I can be so nasty sometimes.

1055
01:13:41,420 --> 01:13:45,117
Now comes the fun part.

1056
01:13:47,492 --> 01:13:50,791
Okay, hold these.

1057
01:13:52,664 --> 01:13:54,427
Come on, hold these.

1058
01:13:54,466 --> 01:13:56,525
There.

1059
01:13:56,568 --> 01:13:58,502
Good.

1060
01:14:00,872 --> 01:14:04,610
Oh, Jamie, that is so gross.

1061
01:14:05,744 --> 01:14:08,770
(both yelp)

1062
01:14:08,814 --> 01:14:11,578
You scream like a girl.

1063
01:14:13,051 --> 01:14:15,246
So do you.

1064
01:14:15,287 --> 01:14:17,687
You don't see me judging.

1065
01:14:17,723 --> 01:14:19,486
Where's Dr. Parker?

1066
01:14:19,524 --> 01:14:21,458
I was gonna go check his office.

1067
01:14:21,493 --> 01:14:22,960
What are you still doing here?

1068
01:14:22,995 --> 01:14:25,020
It's a long story.

1069
01:14:29,401 --> 01:14:31,835
You think we should go in?

1070
01:14:40,145 --> 01:14:42,170
Dr. Parker?

1071
01:14:44,049 --> 01:14:45,710
He's not here.

1072
01:14:54,426 --> 01:14:57,156
This doesn't make any sense.

1073
01:14:57,195 --> 01:14:58,594
What is it?

1074
01:14:58,630 --> 01:15:01,190
This is Dr. Parker's file on Grierson.

1075
01:15:01,233 --> 01:15:03,326
You shouldn't be reading this.

1076
01:15:03,368 --> 01:15:05,836
Okay, but I am. Look.

1077
01:15:05,871 --> 01:15:09,068
If I'm reading it correctly, it says
Grierson was already a patient here,

1078
01:15:09,107 --> 01:15:11,473
but under Dr. Parker Senior's care.

1079
01:15:11,510 --> 01:15:13,740
But the name on the file is Mason Crane.

1080
01:15:13,779 --> 01:15:16,748
Well, I'm sure there's
some sort of explanation for this.

1081
01:15:16,782 --> 01:15:18,579
Of course there's an explanation for it,

1082
01:15:18,617 --> 01:15:20,414
but this is the first time
I've heard of it,

1083
01:15:20,452 --> 01:15:22,181
and I'm gonna ask Dr. Parker why.

1084
01:15:22,220 --> 01:15:23,744
Where are you going?

1085
01:15:23,789 --> 01:15:25,814
We should wait here.

1086
01:15:26,825 --> 01:15:28,053
Right?

1087
01:16:01,893 --> 01:16:03,884
Oh, I could get used to this.

1088
01:16:10,402 --> 01:16:12,597
(grunting)

1089
01:16:12,637 --> 01:16:14,935
P.A. Announcer: On behalf
of the board of directors

1090
01:16:14,973 --> 01:16:17,339
at Parker's Asylum,
we would like to wish you

1091
01:16:17,376 --> 01:16:20,072
a safe and happy holiday.

1092
01:16:21,413 --> 01:16:22,573
Carl?

1093
01:16:22,614 --> 01:16:24,639
P.A. Announcer: Merry Christmas.

1094
01:16:31,590 --> 01:16:35,390
Jamie, are you paying attention?

1095
01:16:35,427 --> 01:16:37,292
Good.

1096
01:16:37,329 --> 01:16:40,264
Now the next thing we do

1097
01:16:40,298 --> 01:16:41,856
with our rib dish...

1098
01:16:41,900 --> 01:16:44,368
we put it in the oven for 88 minutes,

1099
01:16:44,403 --> 01:16:45,836
not 90. 88,

1100
01:16:45,871 --> 01:16:50,604
and cook it at 375 degrees

1101
01:16:50,642 --> 01:16:52,542
on the top rack,

1102
01:16:52,577 --> 01:16:54,704
because we don't want to lose
the vitamins now, do we?

1103
01:16:54,746 --> 01:16:57,146
And then ta-dah!

1104
01:16:57,182 --> 01:16:59,309
Simple as dimple pie.

1105
01:17:06,024 --> 01:17:08,618
Between us,

1106
01:17:08,660 --> 01:17:12,596
I'd say you have a better rack
than old buddy boy in there.

1107
01:17:14,299 --> 01:17:17,393
But friends just don't eat friends.

1108
01:17:17,436 --> 01:17:19,700
I mean, what kind of person would I be

1109
01:17:19,738 --> 01:17:21,706
to eat you for dessert, huh?

1110
01:17:21,740 --> 01:17:23,674
I'm not saying you wouldn't taste good.

1111
01:17:23,708 --> 01:17:25,869
On the contrary,

1112
01:17:25,911 --> 01:17:28,607
I'm sure

1113
01:17:28,647 --> 01:17:30,808
your tight legs

1114
01:17:30,849 --> 01:17:33,409
are juicy.

1115
01:17:33,452 --> 01:17:36,148
And with a cherry glaze...

1116
01:17:37,856 --> 01:17:41,724
mm mm mm.

1117
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:44,923
Oh, sometimes I get so carried away.

1118
01:17:44,963 --> 01:17:47,158
Let's make the eyeball spread.

1119
01:17:47,199 --> 01:17:49,190
(whirring)

1120
01:17:51,203 --> 01:17:53,103
Jamie,

1121
01:17:53,138 --> 01:17:56,835
I gotta say I'm having a wonderful time.

1122
01:17:56,875 --> 01:18:00,038
I'd rather be here with you
than with anyone...

1123
01:18:00,078 --> 01:18:01,545
(screaming)

1124
01:18:11,623 --> 01:18:15,582
Now what did you have to go
and do that for?

1125
01:18:20,565 --> 01:18:22,965
Oh my God.

1126
01:18:25,971 --> 01:18:28,667
Argh!

1127
01:18:28,707 --> 01:18:32,666
We were having such a good time.

1128
01:18:32,711 --> 01:18:35,703
And then you had to go and ruin it

1129
01:18:35,747 --> 01:18:38,147
by stabbing me in the back.

1130
01:18:39,718 --> 01:18:43,984
Jamie, I thought we were friends.

1131
01:18:44,022 --> 01:18:45,922
We were, Mabel.

1132
01:18:45,957 --> 01:18:47,720
We were friends.

1133
01:18:47,759 --> 01:18:49,886
But what do you expect?

1134
01:18:49,928 --> 01:18:53,921
You're cooking half my staff for dinner.

1135
01:18:53,965 --> 01:18:56,058
And Pete...

1136
01:18:56,101 --> 01:18:57,796
oh my God.

1137
01:18:57,836 --> 01:18:59,030
Jamie.

1138
01:18:59,070 --> 01:19:01,129
Mabel,

1139
01:19:01,172 --> 01:19:03,265
we're not that close.

1140
01:19:03,308 --> 01:19:05,105
No, but we're close enough.

1141
01:19:12,284 --> 01:19:15,742
Aww, did Jamie have a boo-boo?

1142
01:19:15,787 --> 01:19:16,913
Mabel, please.

1143
01:19:16,955 --> 01:19:19,788
No more "pleases," Jamie.

1144
01:19:28,266 --> 01:19:31,963
I think it's time we made

1145
01:19:32,003 --> 01:19:34,403
Jamie a la mode.

1146
01:19:44,149 --> 01:19:45,411
(screams)

1147
01:19:48,286 --> 01:19:50,720
Harold,

1148
01:19:50,755 --> 01:19:53,121
it's me...

1149
01:19:53,158 --> 01:19:56,093
your attorney.

1150
01:19:56,127 --> 01:19:59,028
Harold, listen to me.

1151
01:19:59,064 --> 01:20:00,998
Listen to me.

1152
01:20:01,032 --> 01:20:03,592
I found a file that shows
that you were treated here before

1153
01:20:03,635 --> 01:20:05,535
by Dr. Parker's father.

1154
01:20:05,570 --> 01:20:08,095
Now they're trying to cover it up
and I don't know why.

1155
01:20:08,139 --> 01:20:11,836
But this is new information.
We can get you a new hearing.

1156
01:20:11,876 --> 01:20:13,867
We can get you to a new
treatment facility,

1157
01:20:13,912 --> 01:20:16,346
take you to somewhere
that has some goddamn windows.

1158
01:20:18,149 --> 01:20:20,549
Oh God.

1159
01:20:20,585 --> 01:20:22,348
I just... I just...

1160
01:20:22,387 --> 01:20:24,719
I just want to help you.

1161
01:20:42,641 --> 01:20:44,768
L...

1162
01:20:45,777 --> 01:20:47,745
I just...

1163
01:20:47,779 --> 01:20:49,974
I just want to help you.

1164
01:20:50,015 --> 01:20:51,778
Okay?

1165
01:20:56,955 --> 01:20:58,820
Argh!

1166
01:21:00,425 --> 01:21:02,450
I don't... I don't...

1167
01:21:02,494 --> 01:21:05,019
I don't want to die.

1168
01:21:12,103 --> 01:21:14,094
Man on radio: # What a shame #

1169
01:21:14,139 --> 01:21:16,869
# To miss this #

1170
01:21:18,710 --> 01:21:21,907
# Time of year when all is white #

1171
01:21:25,116 --> 01:21:28,574
# We've been all so busy lately #

1172
01:21:30,922 --> 01:21:34,221
# Now I'm asking you to stay #

1173
01:21:37,295 --> 01:21:39,024
# Let's stay home... #

1174
01:21:39,064 --> 01:21:40,554
Johnny.

1175
01:21:41,633 --> 01:21:43,658
Johnny.

1176
01:21:43,702 --> 01:21:45,329
(slow beeping)

1177
01:21:45,370 --> 01:21:47,361
(low growling)

1178
01:21:47,405 --> 01:21:48,633
(screams)

1179
01:21:48,673 --> 01:21:49,833
Shh shh shh.

1180
01:21:49,874 --> 01:21:52,104
(whispering) It's okay. It's me.

1181
01:21:53,945 --> 01:21:56,277
There's a really big guy
around the corner.

1182
01:21:56,314 --> 01:21:58,509
And we don't want to make him angry.

1183
01:21:58,550 --> 01:22:01,178
Understand?

1184
01:22:01,219 --> 01:22:02,584
Okay.

1185
01:22:06,124 --> 01:22:08,649
- Where have you been?
- Jamie's in trouble.

1186
01:22:08,693 --> 01:22:11,025
- Where?
- In the kitchen.

1187
01:22:11,062 --> 01:22:13,826
Okay, I want you to stay here

1188
01:22:13,865 --> 01:22:15,856
and only open the door if it's me,

1189
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:17,765
Jamie or your grandma. You got it?

1190
01:22:17,802 --> 01:22:19,861
Got it.

1191
01:22:19,904 --> 01:22:21,895
I'll be right back.

1192
01:22:21,940 --> 01:22:24,340
(P.A. Chatter)

1193
01:22:35,386 --> 01:22:37,786
Could I have the flashlight back?

1194
01:22:39,824 --> 01:22:41,815
Okay.

1195
01:22:43,428 --> 01:22:45,396
Thanks.

1196
01:22:45,430 --> 01:22:47,455
I got an idea.

1197
01:22:47,499 --> 01:22:49,899
(low growling)

1198
01:22:49,934 --> 01:22:52,164
(slow beeping)

1199
01:22:56,641 --> 01:22:59,508
Hey big guy.

1200
01:22:59,544 --> 01:23:02,809
Remember me?

1201
01:23:02,847 --> 01:23:05,372
Beat it.

1202
01:23:05,416 --> 01:23:07,043
I can't.

1203
01:23:07,085 --> 01:23:08,575
Jamie's in trouble.

1204
01:23:08,620 --> 01:23:11,316
The pretty lady?

1205
01:23:12,357 --> 01:23:15,190
Yeah, the pretty lady.

1206
01:23:18,263 --> 01:23:20,254
Go away.

1207
01:23:20,298 --> 01:23:23,131
Johnny: I wish it didn't have to
come to this

1208
01:23:23,168 --> 01:23:25,693
and I hope I'm not making
a giant mistake,

1209
01:23:25,737 --> 01:23:28,399
but, big guy,

1210
01:23:28,439 --> 01:23:31,772
it's time to get nuts.

1211
01:23:34,045 --> 01:23:35,603
Hey.

1212
01:23:36,948 --> 01:23:38,939
(roaring)

1213
01:23:38,983 --> 01:23:41,178
Yeah, that's it.

1214
01:23:41,219 --> 01:23:42,948
Come and get me.

1215
01:23:42,987 --> 01:23:46,013
(Benny roaring)

1216
01:23:52,497 --> 01:23:54,897
(upbeat music playing on radio)

1217
01:23:56,968 --> 01:24:00,665
Hey, Mabel, chew on this.

1218
01:24:00,705 --> 01:24:02,605
(rapid beeping)

1219
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:04,232
(roaring)

1220
01:24:07,445 --> 01:24:10,710
Okay, big boy,

1221
01:24:10,748 --> 01:24:13,046
let's see what you got.

1222
01:24:18,122 --> 01:24:19,783
(exclaims)

1223
01:24:21,259 --> 01:24:23,284
(Mabel screaming)

1224
01:24:30,902 --> 01:24:32,893
Johnny.

1225
01:24:32,937 --> 01:24:36,031
Shh, it's okay. I got you.

1226
01:24:36,074 --> 01:24:38,304
Johnny, Mabel... she...

1227
01:24:40,245 --> 01:24:41,507
I know.

1228
01:24:43,815 --> 01:24:46,477
I saw.

1229
01:24:48,186 --> 01:24:50,017
She killed Pete, Johnny.

1230
01:24:51,723 --> 01:24:53,714
I'm sorry.

1231
01:24:53,758 --> 01:24:55,919
I'm so sorry.

1232
01:24:56,961 --> 01:24:58,986
I'm so sorry.

1233
01:25:00,164 --> 01:25:02,428
Jamie,

1234
01:25:02,467 --> 01:25:04,731
I need you to be strong.

1235
01:25:06,337 --> 01:25:08,703
Sabrina's waiting for us.

1236
01:25:08,740 --> 01:25:11,004
Sabrina?

1237
01:25:11,042 --> 01:25:12,703
Where is she?

1238
01:25:13,711 --> 01:25:15,872
(door opens)

1239
01:25:18,182 --> 01:25:20,207
(whispers) Grandma.

1240
01:25:21,286 --> 01:25:24,312
P.A. Announcer: Please make the
necessary arrangements with scheduling.

1241
01:25:24,355 --> 01:25:26,016
Johnny, wait.
I just wanted to say something.

1242
01:25:26,057 --> 01:25:28,184
Jamie, there will be time for all that
when we get out of here.

1243
01:25:28,226 --> 01:25:29,818
No.

1244
01:25:29,861 --> 01:25:32,989
Johnny, I never stopped wearing
your wedding ring.

1245
01:25:34,299 --> 01:25:37,291
I just want you to know

1246
01:25:37,335 --> 01:25:40,065
I never stopped wearing it.

1247
01:26:13,171 --> 01:26:14,305
Sabrina. Sabrina, you can come out now.

1248
01:26:14,305 --> 01:26:16,865
Sabrina. Sabrina, you can come out now.

1249
01:26:18,409 --> 01:26:20,206
Shit.

1250
01:26:39,364 --> 01:26:41,992
Holy Father Who art in heaven,

1251
01:26:42,033 --> 01:26:44,228
hallowed be Thy name, Thy kingdom come,

1252
01:26:44,268 --> 01:26:45,599
Thy will be done!

1253
01:26:46,604 --> 01:26:47,764
(gasps)

1254
01:26:49,374 --> 01:26:51,399
(gagging)

1255
01:27:07,625 --> 01:27:09,616
- Sabrina.
- Sabrina.

1256
01:27:09,660 --> 01:27:11,958
Johnny, I'm over here.

1257
01:27:11,996 --> 01:27:15,557
- Jamie: Sabrina.
- Jamie.

1258
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:17,830
Jamie: We're over here, Sabrina.

1259
01:27:20,838 --> 01:27:22,772
Johnny, I'm over here.

1260
01:27:22,807 --> 01:27:24,798
Sabrina.

1261
01:27:24,842 --> 01:27:26,673
It's okay.

1262
01:27:26,711 --> 01:27:28,440
We got you.

1263
01:27:28,479 --> 01:27:30,606
Jamie: Thank God we found you.

1264
01:27:32,917 --> 01:27:34,942
(panting)

1265
01:27:37,622 --> 01:27:40,090
Hey, kid, it's okay. We got you.

1266
01:27:41,292 --> 01:27:44,022
(whispers) He's here.

1267
01:27:56,307 --> 01:27:58,138
Go. Get out of here.

1268
01:27:58,176 --> 01:28:00,041
I'm not leaving without you.

1269
01:28:00,078 --> 01:28:01,238
Just go.

1270
01:28:09,654 --> 01:28:11,554
Sabrina, go go go.

1271
01:28:11,589 --> 01:28:15,081
If you want them,
you're gonna have to go through me.

1272
01:28:19,497 --> 01:28:22,625
Jamie, run! Run as fast as you can!

1273
01:28:24,435 --> 01:28:26,926
Jamie, he's gonna cut you off. Go go go!

1274
01:28:47,425 --> 01:28:49,655
Jamie?

1275
01:28:55,333 --> 01:28:56,561
It's gonna be okay.

1276
01:29:00,271 --> 01:29:02,466
Be strong.

1277
01:29:04,509 --> 01:29:06,568
(screams)

1278
01:29:14,051 --> 01:29:17,248
(shuffling)

1279
01:29:23,261 --> 01:29:25,024
What the hell do you want?

1280
01:29:25,062 --> 01:29:27,155
I'm sorry,

1281
01:29:27,198 --> 01:29:28,859
really sorry.

1282
01:29:28,900 --> 01:29:32,597
I'm over it. Now get out of here.

1283
01:29:32,637 --> 01:29:35,197
She's gone.

1284
01:29:35,239 --> 01:29:38,470
I'm sorry, she's gone.

1285
01:29:38,509 --> 01:29:41,535
Oliver, if you know where Jamie is,

1286
01:29:41,579 --> 01:29:43,274
by God you'd better tell me.

1287
01:29:43,314 --> 01:29:46,806
The walls... if you listen

1288
01:29:46,851 --> 01:29:48,944
they tell you secrets...

1289
01:29:48,986 --> 01:29:52,046
secrets only the walls could know.

1290
01:29:52,089 --> 01:29:55,456
I know secrets too.

1291
01:29:55,493 --> 01:29:57,290
The spirits...

1292
01:29:57,328 --> 01:29:59,558
they're crazy too, you know.

1293
01:29:59,597 --> 01:30:01,690
What are you babbling about?

1294
01:30:01,732 --> 01:30:05,190
The land, this building.

1295
01:30:05,236 --> 01:30:08,637
Listen. Listen.

1296
01:30:08,673 --> 01:30:10,834
I don't hear anything.

1297
01:30:10,875 --> 01:30:12,934
If you want to know, then listen!

1298
01:30:14,078 --> 01:30:16,103
Listen.

1299
01:30:18,382 --> 01:30:20,407
They hide

1300
01:30:20,451 --> 01:30:22,851
deep in the ground.

1301
01:30:24,155 --> 01:30:25,986
Your answer

1302
01:30:26,023 --> 01:30:28,423
lies there.

1303
01:30:51,415 --> 01:30:53,815
Are you the Woodcutter?

1304
01:30:56,153 --> 01:30:58,178
Let's find out.

1305
01:31:13,671 --> 01:31:16,663
Oliver,

1306
01:31:16,707 --> 01:31:20,336
if we get out of this alive,
do me a favor,

1307
01:31:20,378 --> 01:31:23,313
put some clothes on.

1308
01:31:56,781 --> 01:31:59,545
Sabrina! Oh God.

1309
01:31:59,583 --> 01:32:01,744
Sabrina.

1310
01:32:01,786 --> 01:32:04,118
Wake up, Sabrina.

1311
01:32:12,430 --> 01:32:15,729
Sabrina, over here.

1312
01:32:26,110 --> 01:32:28,101
Jamie.

1313
01:32:28,145 --> 01:32:32,081
Sabrina, we have to get out
of here, okay?

1314
01:32:32,116 --> 01:32:35,142
We... we...

1315
01:32:40,591 --> 01:32:42,320
we have to get out of here.

1316
01:32:50,134 --> 01:32:52,125
Sabrina, wait.

1317
01:33:06,517 --> 01:33:07,984
Grandma?

1318
01:33:09,019 --> 01:33:11,283
(screams)

1319
01:33:11,322 --> 01:33:13,950
Run, Sabrina, run!

1320
01:33:17,762 --> 01:33:19,696
Leave her alone.

1321
01:33:29,507 --> 01:33:31,099
Johnny.

1322
01:33:40,951 --> 01:33:42,976
Go hide, Sabrina.

1323
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:57,927
Argh!

1324
01:34:05,709 --> 01:34:07,506
Jamie: Johnny!

1325
01:34:42,379 --> 01:34:43,778
Johnny, run.

1326
01:34:45,449 --> 01:34:46,939
Run.

1327
01:34:51,722 --> 01:34:53,280
Johnny, no.

1328
01:34:55,526 --> 01:34:56,959
Johnny!

1329
01:35:29,426 --> 01:35:31,291
Jamie.

1330
01:35:39,737 --> 01:35:41,602
Stay away from him.

1331
01:35:46,243 --> 01:35:50,805
Who... who...

1332
01:35:50,848 --> 01:35:53,612
who are you?

1333
01:36:21,445 --> 01:36:23,470
Hello, Johnny.

1334
01:36:25,716 --> 01:36:27,183
Dr. Parker?

1335
01:36:27,217 --> 01:36:29,378
You're the...?

1336
01:36:29,420 --> 01:36:32,389
How could you do this?

1337
01:36:32,423 --> 01:36:36,257
Do you want my professional opinion
or do you want the truth?

1338
01:36:36,293 --> 01:36:39,262
My professional opinion is
that as a child

1339
01:36:39,296 --> 01:36:41,924
I was neglected by my mother
and at the same time

1340
01:36:41,966 --> 01:36:44,457
severely beaten by my father.

1341
01:36:44,501 --> 01:36:47,061
During one particular example

1342
01:36:47,104 --> 01:36:49,436
of patriarchal brutality

1343
01:36:49,473 --> 01:36:51,839
my father drowned me repeatedly

1344
01:36:51,875 --> 01:36:55,333
until I promised never to question
his authority again,

1345
01:36:55,379 --> 01:36:57,210
drowned me in the same cage

1346
01:36:57,247 --> 01:36:59,579
where he would drown his patients.

1347
01:36:59,617 --> 01:37:03,144
But with me

1348
01:37:03,187 --> 01:37:05,815
it was different...

1349
01:37:05,856 --> 01:37:07,847
very different.

1350
01:37:07,891 --> 01:37:10,485
The truth, you see,
is much more interesting.

1351
01:37:10,527 --> 01:37:14,520
You see, Jamie, when he raised
the cage for the last time

1352
01:37:14,565 --> 01:37:19,229
he brought up not only
his waterlogged son

1353
01:37:19,269 --> 01:37:22,568
but something from deep inside the well,

1354
01:37:22,606 --> 01:37:25,166
something evil,

1355
01:37:25,209 --> 01:37:28,701
something powerful,

1356
01:37:28,746 --> 01:37:33,012
something with an unquenchable
thirst for life.

1357
01:37:33,050 --> 01:37:35,348
I don't understand.

1358
01:37:35,386 --> 01:37:38,321
Grierson... how does he fit in?

1359
01:37:38,355 --> 01:37:40,550
Grierson is nothing,

1360
01:37:40,591 --> 01:37:43,958
like a piece of clay
at the hands of a sculptor...

1361
01:37:43,994 --> 01:37:47,760
easily manipulated, easy to train.

1362
01:37:47,798 --> 01:37:49,891
Wolves hunt in packs.

1363
01:37:49,933 --> 01:37:51,901
But ultimately he was a fool.

1364
01:37:51,935 --> 01:37:56,338
Yes, I'd let him wear my suit,

1365
01:37:56,373 --> 01:37:59,308
but a man is not the measure
of the clothes on his back.

1366
01:37:59,343 --> 01:38:01,334
I created in Grierson

1367
01:38:01,378 --> 01:38:04,245
a perfect scapegoat for my past crimes.

1368
01:38:04,281 --> 01:38:08,513
I brought him here so that
I could watch over him forever.

1369
01:38:09,653 --> 01:38:11,644
But when your husband decided

1370
01:38:11,689 --> 01:38:14,988
to take justice into his own hands,

1371
01:38:15,025 --> 01:38:17,391
I couldn't resist.

1372
01:38:17,428 --> 01:38:19,419
I saw the opportunity

1373
01:38:19,463 --> 01:38:22,261
to tie up all my loose ends
in one night.

1374
01:38:23,767 --> 01:38:26,167
You see, Johnny, in the grand scheme

1375
01:38:26,203 --> 01:38:29,866
that's all you are...

1376
01:38:29,907 --> 01:38:32,171
a loose end.

1377
01:38:32,209 --> 01:38:35,804
You didn't have to kill everyone.

1378
01:38:35,846 --> 01:38:37,837
Karen had nothing to do with this.

1379
01:38:37,881 --> 01:38:40,179
Well, the irony of a grandmother
and a granddaughter

1380
01:38:40,217 --> 01:38:42,014
wasn't lost on me.

1381
01:38:42,052 --> 01:38:44,213
Speaking of which,

1382
01:38:44,254 --> 01:38:47,621
I'd better get about finding Little Red.

1383
01:38:52,963 --> 01:38:55,523
Why did you stop

1384
01:38:55,566 --> 01:38:58,262
after all of these years,
after Johnny's sister?

1385
01:38:58,302 --> 01:39:00,827
Why did you stop?

1386
01:39:00,871 --> 01:39:03,101
Who said I stopped?

1387
01:39:06,009 --> 01:39:08,876
You won't get away with this.

1388
01:39:08,912 --> 01:39:10,903
Dr. Parker: I can see the papers now...

1389
01:39:10,948 --> 01:39:13,109
"A Christmas Miracle.

1390
01:39:13,150 --> 01:39:17,086
Harold Grierson the Wolf
is Killed by Dr. Parker

1391
01:39:17,121 --> 01:39:19,112
in Horrific Holiday Massacre.

1392
01:39:19,156 --> 01:39:21,181
A Hero for our Time."

1393
01:39:23,460 --> 01:39:25,894
But the Wolf won't be gone for long.

1394
01:39:25,929 --> 01:39:28,397
He will return

1395
01:39:28,432 --> 01:39:31,094
when the hunger gets too great.

1396
01:39:31,135 --> 01:39:33,695
You killed my sister.

1397
01:39:35,072 --> 01:39:37,734
I killed lots of little girls.

1398
01:39:37,775 --> 01:39:41,074
And like all those beautiful girls,

1399
01:39:41,111 --> 01:39:43,978
you too will find what evil awaits

1400
01:39:44,014 --> 01:39:46,346
in the bottom of the well.

1401
01:39:58,962 --> 01:40:01,226
(wrench clatters)

1402
01:40:03,467 --> 01:40:04,934
Little Red.

1403
01:40:04,968 --> 01:40:06,629
Sabrina, run.

1404
01:40:06,670 --> 01:40:09,195
Get out of here. Run and hide!

1405
01:40:15,212 --> 01:40:18,649
Johnny, Johnny, you have to get up.

1406
01:40:22,719 --> 01:40:25,517
You can't hide, Sabrina.

1407
01:40:25,556 --> 01:40:30,220
Johnny, wake up. Johnny, wake up.

1408
01:40:31,461 --> 01:40:32,792
Katie: Four...

1409
01:40:32,830 --> 01:40:35,594
Katie.

1410
01:40:35,632 --> 01:40:39,728
Katie: Five, six,

1411
01:40:39,770 --> 01:40:44,070
seven, eight,

1412
01:40:44,107 --> 01:40:47,736
nine, 10.

1413
01:40:47,778 --> 01:40:50,338
Ready or not,

1414
01:40:50,380 --> 01:40:52,746
here I come.

1415
01:40:57,888 --> 01:41:00,254
Johnny, I can't play now.

1416
01:41:00,290 --> 01:41:01,951
You have to get up.

1417
01:41:01,992 --> 01:41:03,823
Johnny: I'm dying.

1418
01:41:03,861 --> 01:41:05,328
I don't think I can.

1419
01:41:05,362 --> 01:41:07,762
Katie: You don't have a choice.

1420
01:41:07,798 --> 01:41:09,163
Get up!

1421
01:41:09,199 --> 01:41:11,599
Jamie: Johnny, please.

1422
01:41:11,635 --> 01:41:13,626
You have to get up.

1423
01:41:18,575 --> 01:41:21,135
Oh my God, Jamie. How do I stop it?

1424
01:41:21,178 --> 01:41:24,409
You can't. He broke the lever.

1425
01:41:24,448 --> 01:41:26,177
There's got to be another way.

1426
01:41:26,216 --> 01:41:27,513
There isn't.

1427
01:41:27,551 --> 01:41:29,178
Johnny, you gotta go.

1428
01:41:29,219 --> 01:41:30,982
Save Sabrina.

1429
01:41:31,021 --> 01:41:33,581
Don't let him get her too.

1430
01:41:33,624 --> 01:41:35,114
I'm not leaving you.

1431
01:41:36,159 --> 01:41:38,423
Listen to me, Johnny.

1432
01:41:38,462 --> 01:41:40,589
You have time
to come back and save me.

1433
01:41:40,631 --> 01:41:43,623
But you gotta go now, okay?

1434
01:41:43,667 --> 01:41:45,999
Jamie, there's not enough time.

1435
01:41:46,036 --> 01:41:48,197
God damn it, Johnny, just go.

1436
01:41:52,809 --> 01:41:53,969
Go.

1437
01:41:55,279 --> 01:41:57,110
Go.

1438
01:42:06,623 --> 01:42:08,682
Dr. Parker: You can't hide, Sabrina.

1439
01:42:08,725 --> 01:42:10,522
I will find you.

1440
01:42:12,195 --> 01:42:14,060
Hey, little girl, come quick.

1441
01:42:14,097 --> 01:42:16,895
Quick quick. Here, you hide in there.

1442
01:42:16,934 --> 01:42:18,265
Go on. Go on.

1443
01:42:28,078 --> 01:42:30,410
Oliver,

1444
01:42:30,447 --> 01:42:31,709
where is the girl?

1445
01:42:33,684 --> 01:42:37,814
Uh, I don't know
what you're talking about, sir.

1446
01:42:39,523 --> 01:42:41,423
Aren't you a little overdressed?

1447
01:42:41,458 --> 01:42:43,892
Aren't you?

1448
01:42:45,228 --> 01:42:46,456
Where is she?

1449
01:42:46,496 --> 01:42:48,862
(Oliver gagging)

1450
01:42:51,268 --> 01:42:53,293
(bones crack)

1451
01:43:00,677 --> 01:43:02,508
Hello, Little Red.

1452
01:43:02,546 --> 01:43:03,706
(screaming)

1453
01:43:03,747 --> 01:43:06,079
(panting)

1454
01:43:13,957 --> 01:43:15,652
Johnny.

1455
01:43:15,692 --> 01:43:17,717
(grunting, panting)

1456
01:43:26,436 --> 01:43:28,996
(Sabrina whimpering)

1457
01:43:32,209 --> 01:43:34,643
(screaming)

1458
01:43:51,928 --> 01:43:53,589
Now...

1459
01:43:55,766 --> 01:43:58,394
where were we?

1460
01:43:58,435 --> 01:44:00,926
Come here. Come here.

1461
01:44:04,007 --> 01:44:05,599
(screams)

1462
01:44:14,151 --> 01:44:16,642
(heart beating)

1463
01:44:24,728 --> 01:44:27,822
(panting)

1464
01:44:43,780 --> 01:44:45,372
Jamie!

1465
01:45:07,104 --> 01:45:09,129
(coughing)

1466
01:45:14,077 --> 01:45:16,637
- Go.
- Johnny.

1467
01:45:33,263 --> 01:45:34,855
Johnny?

1468
01:45:38,535 --> 01:45:40,935
Jamie's voice: I love you.

1469
01:45:42,038 --> 01:45:43,198
Katie's voice: Johnny.

1470
01:45:50,614 --> 01:45:54,482
Katie's voice: Johnny, you found me.

1471
01:46:00,423 --> 01:46:02,516
Johnny.

1472
01:46:04,127 --> 01:46:06,391
Johnny.

1473
01:46:07,831 --> 01:46:09,856
Johnny?

1474
01:46:11,801 --> 01:46:14,031
Johnny, wake up.

1475
01:46:14,070 --> 01:46:16,561
Johnny, wake up.

1476
01:46:19,009 --> 01:46:21,739
No, Johnny.

1477
01:46:21,778 --> 01:46:24,178
Johnny, no, wake up.

1478
01:46:24,214 --> 01:46:26,205
(gasps)

1479
01:46:28,318 --> 01:46:29,478
Hey.

1480
01:46:29,519 --> 01:46:31,510
Hey babe.

1481
01:46:48,305 --> 01:46:50,330
(electricity whirrs)

1482
01:46:55,312 --> 01:46:58,110
- (door buzzes)
- Male voice: Access granted.

1483
01:46:58,148 --> 01:46:59,809
Good morning, Dr. Morgan.

1484
01:46:59,849 --> 01:47:01,942
(children laughing)

1485
01:47:05,155 --> 01:47:07,885
Katie's voice: Johnny.

1486
01:47:07,924 --> 01:47:10,984
# Waiting waiting waiting #

1487
01:47:11,027 --> 01:47:15,521
# Waiting waiting waiting #

1488
01:47:15,565 --> 01:47:21,162
# Waiting waiting waiting #

1489
01:47:21,204 --> 01:47:23,729
# Waiting waiting... #

1490
01:47:23,773 --> 01:47:25,434
Johnny?

1491
01:47:25,475 --> 01:47:28,672
# Waiting... #

1492
01:47:39,923 --> 01:47:42,824
# When your hands #

1493
01:47:42,859 --> 01:47:45,453
# Are cold #

1494
01:47:46,463 --> 01:47:49,762
# When the leaves on your flowers #

1495
01:47:49,799 --> 01:47:53,166
# Start to fall #

1496
01:47:53,203 --> 01:47:56,104
# When the trees #

1497
01:47:56,139 --> 01:47:59,575
# Lie bare #

1498
01:47:59,609 --> 01:48:03,170
# I will be there #

1499
01:48:03,213 --> 01:48:06,341
# I will be there #

1500
01:48:08,652 --> 01:48:12,748
# We won't speak of bitter words #

1501
01:48:12,789 --> 01:48:16,054
# We'll lay them down #

1502
01:48:16,092 --> 01:48:20,995
# Lay them down #

1503
01:48:22,365 --> 01:48:26,028
# We'll talk of blessings heard #

1504
01:48:26,069 --> 01:48:29,232
# And hold them close #

1505
01:48:29,272 --> 01:48:33,675
# Hold them close #

1506
01:48:46,356 --> 01:48:49,848
# When we walk #

1507
01:48:49,893 --> 01:48:52,862
# Along #

1508
01:48:52,896 --> 01:48:56,332
# When the time we have together #

1509
01:48:56,366 --> 01:48:59,699
# Is too short #

1510
01:48:59,736 --> 01:49:03,001
# I will take #

1511
01:49:03,039 --> 01:49:06,338
# Your hand #

1512
01:49:06,376 --> 01:49:09,038
# And I will keep you on the road #

1513
01:49:09,079 --> 01:49:15,575
# So you don't fall #

1514
01:49:15,618 --> 01:49:19,076
# These days will shine so bright #

1515
01:49:19,122 --> 01:49:22,785
# And lead us home #

1516
01:49:22,826 --> 01:49:28,822
# Lead us home #

1517
01:49:28,865 --> 01:49:32,357
# They'll light the time we have #

1518
01:49:32,402 --> 01:49:35,894
# And keep us warm #

1519
01:49:35,939 --> 01:49:43,311
# Keep us warm #

1520
01:50:08,772 --> 01:50:12,731
# And when the memories call #

1521
01:50:12,776 --> 01:50:16,075
# I need them #

1522
01:50:16,112 --> 01:50:19,411
# I need them #

1523
01:50:19,449 --> 01:50:22,179
# Oh #

1524
01:50:22,218 --> 01:50:25,813
# But when I scale that wall #

1525
01:50:25,855 --> 01:50:29,313
# I'll leave them #

1526
01:50:29,359 --> 01:50:37,232
# I'll leave them. #
