00:01:59,126 --> 00:02:00,639
Hello?

2
00:02:02,406 --> 00:02:03,885
Is anyone in there?

3
00:02:05,526 --> 00:02:07,691
Hello?

4
00:02:07,726 --> 00:02:09,891
Please...

5
00:02:09,926 --> 00:02:12,086
Open... open the door!

6
00:02:15,446 --> 00:02:17,126
Mr... Please, could someone...

7
00:02:17,161 --> 00:02:18,771
Hurry up!

8
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:20,924
Hurry up!
MAN: Yes, yes. Relax.

9
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,043
Get out of the way. Out of the way!

10
00:02:26,366 --> 00:02:27,924
Open the door!

11
00:02:30,726 --> 00:02:32,171
Hello? Is there somebody in there?

12
00:02:32,206 --> 00:02:35,323
Yes. Go away, please.
Find somebody else to annoy.

13
00:02:36,366 --> 00:02:38,326
GIRL: What's happened?
Hello? Hello!

14
00:02:38,361 --> 00:02:40,317
I said piss off! Now!

15
00:02:43,206 --> 00:02:44,966
Hello, is there somebody in there?
Open up!

16
00:02:45,001 --> 00:02:47,051
Are you sure there's
someone in there?

17
00:02:47,086 --> 00:02:48,917
Yes, I'm sure.
Well, go and get the janitor.

18
00:02:51,646 --> 00:02:53,079
Hello! He...

19
00:03:01,366 --> 00:03:02,799
Mate?

20
00:03:04,126 --> 00:03:05,559
Mate, is that you in there?

21
00:03:07,286 --> 00:03:09,242
Shit. Shit.

22
00:03:11,646 --> 00:03:13,091
Open the door!

23
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:14,923
If there's someone in here,
open the door!

24
00:03:17,526 --> 00:03:19,084
Open the door!

25
00:03:20,606 --> 00:03:22,206
MAN: Are you sure
there's someone in the...

26
00:03:22,241 --> 00:03:23,639
Just open the fucking door!

27
00:03:37,086 --> 00:03:38,519
Oh, my God.

28
00:03:54,886 --> 00:03:56,646
Yeah, no, it's me.
Yeah, it's me playing.

29
00:03:56,681 --> 00:03:58,611
Um... alright.

30
00:03:58,646 --> 00:04:01,526
Well, I'll talk to you about it
in the first break, OK?

31
00:04:01,561 --> 00:04:02,959
Alright. Yep. Cool. See ya.

32
00:04:07,966 --> 00:04:09,411
Mel!

33
00:04:09,446 --> 00:04:12,766
BO Y: Next year, um,
when school's finished...

34
00:04:12,801 --> 00:04:14,371
I'm leaving, Melody!

35
00:04:14,406 --> 00:04:15,998
...I'd really like to be like my dad.

36
00:04:17,126 --> 00:04:21,846
You know, he's just...
you've just gotta admire him.

37
00:04:21,881 --> 00:04:24,446
I mean, he works really,
really hard,

38
00:04:24,481 --> 00:04:26,091
he's successful -

39
00:04:26,126 --> 00:04:30,005
he's a partner in this major firm.

40
00:04:31,286 --> 00:04:32,719
You know, 6-figure salary.

41
00:04:36,206 --> 00:04:39,566
They have these fucking
beautiful offices.

42
00:04:39,601 --> 00:04:41,726
MARCUS: Mel!

43
00:04:43,806 --> 00:04:45,683
MARCUS: I'm leaving, Melody!

44
00:05:18,926 --> 00:05:23,286
I remember when I was little -
I was probably about eight or nine -

45
00:05:23,321 --> 00:05:26,371
and, um, saved up all my money

46
00:05:26,406 --> 00:05:28,920
for... for this
'Dollar a Day' commercial.

47
00:05:29,966 --> 00:05:31,611
You know, the ones with the kids

48
00:05:31,646 --> 00:05:33,523
with all the flies
all over their face.

49
00:05:35,206 --> 00:05:37,886
Anyway, I sponsored
this little girl.

50
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:39,842
Her name was Jemina.

51
00:05:40,886 --> 00:05:42,365
She was so cute.

52
00:05:44,206 --> 00:05:47,286
Anyway, my brother,
Marcus, found out,

53
00:05:47,321 --> 00:05:48,719
who then told my dad.

54
00:05:50,526 --> 00:05:52,084
God, he got so angry.

55
00:05:53,246 --> 00:05:54,964
He said I was wasting money.

56
00:05:57,326 --> 00:05:58,759
You know, she could've died.

57
00:06:02,566 --> 00:06:03,999
I love kids.

58
00:06:05,286 --> 00:06:07,117
I think I could be
a primary school teacher.

59
00:06:08,486 --> 00:06:10,171
It'd be fun.

60
00:06:10,206 --> 00:06:12,011
Oh, and animals too.

61
00:06:12,046 --> 00:06:14,276
They're just so gorgeous.

62
00:06:18,126 --> 00:06:19,639
We weren't allowed pets, though.

63
00:07:34,126 --> 00:07:35,559
Fuck.

64
00:07:59,006 --> 00:08:00,451
BO Y: Yeah, I've got a good body,

65
00:08:00,486 --> 00:08:02,306
but it's not about being vain,
you know?

66
00:08:02,341 --> 00:08:04,091
It's about being a top-class athlete.

67
00:08:04,126 --> 00:08:08,046
Like, I love scoring goals
and winning and... you know?

68
00:08:08,081 --> 00:08:09,651
Just making good time.

69
00:08:09,686 --> 00:08:11,611
And then I fucking hate school.

70
00:08:11,646 --> 00:08:14,806
I sit there and I listen to shit
that has no relevance to me.

71
00:08:14,841 --> 00:08:16,251
Like, fair enough for someone else

72
00:08:16,286 --> 00:08:18,926
who's gonna go off and be a lawyer
or some shit like that,

73
00:08:18,961 --> 00:08:21,931
but for me it's just fucking useless,
you know?

74
00:08:21,966 --> 00:08:25,926
Who actually gives a fuck about
some dead poet from 200 years ago?

75
00:08:25,961 --> 00:08:29,886
Premier league soccer players,
we don't need maths or Shakespeare

76
00:08:29,921 --> 00:08:31,922
or Tutan-fucking-khamen, you know?

77
00:08:44,526 --> 00:08:46,482
Luke!

78
00:09:04,886 --> 00:09:06,966
BO Y: I love tits.

79
00:09:07,001 --> 00:09:08,811
I love pussy.

80
00:09:08,846 --> 00:09:11,724
I just love women.

81
00:09:15,086 --> 00:09:17,286
I guess saying all that shit
makes me normal, huh?

82
00:09:17,321 --> 00:09:19,439
It's like people
can just look at me and say,

83
00:09:19,474 --> 00:09:21,557
"Oh, he's just this normal,
horny little kid."

84
00:09:23,246 --> 00:09:24,679
You wanna know the truth, though?

85
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:27,604
I love cock.

86
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:30,919
I love arse.

87
00:09:32,686 --> 00:09:36,046
And saying that shit,
people just look at me like...

88
00:09:36,081 --> 00:09:38,566
...Iook at me like
I'm this sick, perverted,

89
00:09:38,601 --> 00:09:40,796
twisted little fucking outcast.

90
00:09:42,246 --> 00:09:43,679
That's school, though, innit?

91
00:10:05,886 --> 00:10:09,246
GIRL: After next year all my friends
want to be big, independent women

92
00:10:09,281 --> 00:10:11,046
or have some great career.

93
00:10:11,081 --> 00:10:12,604
Yeah.

94
00:10:14,606 --> 00:10:16,562
I think marriage is a nice thought.

95
00:10:17,606 --> 00:10:19,051
Now, I know there's probably

96
00:10:19,086 --> 00:10:20,846
a million feminist
butch chicks out there

97
00:10:20,881 --> 00:10:22,291
who'd kill me for saying that,

98
00:10:22,326 --> 00:10:25,846
but I'm not talking about
one of those fat housewives

99
00:10:25,881 --> 00:10:27,404
who go shopping in their trackies.

100
00:10:29,126 --> 00:10:31,560
I just like the idea of being in love.

101
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:35,051
I mean, just 'cause you're married

102
00:10:35,086 --> 00:10:36,986
doesn't mean you have to
let yourself go.

103
00:10:37,021 --> 00:10:38,886
SOCCER COMMENTATOR:
And we've had 100 minutes

104
00:10:38,921 --> 00:10:41,163
of end to end football here tonight,

105
00:10:41,198 --> 00:10:43,371
and some very tired legs
out there now.

106
00:10:43,406 --> 00:10:48,006
To Viera - ooh, it's a careless pass.
Intercepted by Ryan Giggs.

107
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:50,766
And now Manchester United streaming
ahead in numbers now.

108
00:10:50,801 --> 00:10:53,326
Dwight Yorke making a run
to the corner flag.

109
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:55,011
Support waiting in the centre as well,

110
00:10:55,046 --> 00:10:57,486
but it's still Giggs
on the edge of the area.

111
00:10:57,521 --> 00:11:00,163
Past Keown now, past Dixon.

112
00:11:00,198 --> 00:11:02,771
And a sensational goal!

113
00:11:02,806 --> 00:11:04,891
How can Arsenal possibly come back

114
00:11:04,926 --> 00:11:07,331
after such an unbelievable finish
as that?

115
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:10,206
Ryan Giggs surely has never hit
a more telling strike

116
00:11:10,241 --> 00:11:11,731
at such a vital time,

117
00:11:11,766 --> 00:11:15,051
surely clinching this FA Cup
semifinal for Manchester United.

118
00:11:15,086 --> 00:11:17,884
And you'll have to wait a long time
to see another goal like that.

119
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:31,491
BO Y: Back home in England,
me and my family,

120
00:11:31,526 --> 00:11:34,371
we always lived in the same street,
the same house,

121
00:11:34,406 --> 00:11:38,524
and all the neighbours and friends,
they knew my medical problems.

122
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:41,806
I've got one leg longer
than the other one

123
00:11:41,841 --> 00:11:45,242
and, um, that gives me a limp.

124
00:11:46,286 --> 00:11:48,566
I was also born with two urethras,

125
00:11:48,601 --> 00:11:50,811
and one of them I can control,

126
00:11:50,846 --> 00:11:53,131
and one of them just does
its own thing,

127
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:58,399
and... I wet myself, and...
it's really embarrassing.

128
00:12:01,566 --> 00:12:04,686
Uh... I started school here
three months ago,

129
00:12:04,721 --> 00:12:07,075
when we moved down here.

130
00:12:08,606 --> 00:12:10,251
I used to have this saying

131
00:12:10,286 --> 00:12:13,164
that the shit would hit the fan
but it would never hit me.

132
00:12:15,966 --> 00:12:19,163
Recently it's really, really
started to stink.

133
00:12:41,246 --> 00:12:43,243
MARCUS: Hey.

134
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:45,241
Mel! Mel!

135
00:12:47,526 --> 00:12:49,562
Listen, uh... Are you gonna be OK?

136
00:12:50,846 --> 00:12:52,422
Mel!

137
00:12:52,457 --> 00:12:53,998
Melody!

138
00:13:14,046 --> 00:13:15,479
Hey, Mel.

139
00:13:34,486 --> 00:13:35,931
Hey.
What's up?

140
00:13:35,966 --> 00:13:38,206
Not much.
Your mum still away?

141
00:13:38,241 --> 00:13:39,771
Yeah. She is.

142
00:13:39,806 --> 00:13:41,966
I haven't spoken to her for a while.
Oh, really?

143
00:13:42,001 --> 00:13:44,531
When's she getting back?
I don't know.

144
00:13:44,566 --> 00:13:47,046
Probably three weeks or so.
So you're home alone?

145
00:13:47,081 --> 00:13:49,514
Yeah. It's just me and Marcus.

146
00:14:16,686 --> 00:14:18,846
OK, there he is.
Good luck.

147
00:14:18,881 --> 00:14:20,325
See you upstairs.

148
00:14:26,686 --> 00:14:28,995
How you doing, Luke?
Hey.

149
00:14:30,086 --> 00:14:31,864
How are you?

150
00:14:31,899 --> 00:14:33,643
Not bad.

151
00:14:41,126 --> 00:14:42,878
Hey.
Hey.

152
00:14:55,966 --> 00:14:58,275
I heard your story in English
did really well.

153
00:15:11,206 --> 00:15:13,003
You know, it's, um...

154
00:15:14,726 --> 00:15:18,326
...it's been said that exposure to...

155
00:15:18,361 --> 00:15:21,891
...classical kinds
of music as a child

156
00:15:21,926 --> 00:15:27,051
triggers these neural pathways
in your brain

157
00:15:27,086 --> 00:15:32,683
that create this spatial,
temporal reasoning ability.

158
00:15:36,486 --> 00:15:38,124
It increases your intellect.

159
00:15:46,486 --> 00:15:48,283
Your story...

160
00:15:49,926 --> 00:15:51,564
...was it, um...

161
00:15:52,926 --> 00:15:54,406
...about somebody in particular?

162
00:15:54,441 --> 00:15:57,318
Was it... personal?

163
00:15:58,846 --> 00:16:00,438
Of course it was personal.

164
00:16:02,286 --> 00:16:03,719
Oh.

165
00:16:15,126 --> 00:16:16,559
Who was it about?

166
00:16:20,966 --> 00:16:22,445
Look, I've gotta go.

167
00:16:23,646 --> 00:16:26,524
Marcus. Come on, I didn't...

168
00:17:17,766 --> 00:17:20,526
BO Y: Hey, Luke. What happened
at the party after I left?

169
00:17:20,561 --> 00:17:23,286
LUKE: Oh, I was fucking gone, man.
BO Y 2: You were fucked!

170
00:17:23,321 --> 00:17:25,966
I'd gone into the corner to
take a slash, right,

171
00:17:26,001 --> 00:17:27,451
'cause I was fucking parro,

172
00:17:27,486 --> 00:17:29,606
and this little bastard
taps me on the shoulder...

173
00:17:29,641 --> 00:17:31,451
What - Dino?
Nah. Yeah, Ben.

174
00:17:31,486 --> 00:17:33,426
So I turn around
while I'm taking a piss

175
00:17:33,461 --> 00:17:35,331
and just piss all over this guy, man.

176
00:17:35,366 --> 00:17:37,586
You fucking pissed all over him?
What did Ben do?

177
00:17:37,621 --> 00:17:39,806
What could he do, man?
He was covered in piss.

178
00:17:39,841 --> 00:17:41,922
Hey, Seanie!
Hey, Sean.

179
00:17:43,686 --> 00:17:45,131
How's it going, buddy?

180
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:47,760
You get fucking shit on your dick?

181
00:17:50,766 --> 00:17:53,766
Hey, you like taking it
or giving it, eh?

182
00:17:53,801 --> 00:17:55,903
I could give it to you, Seanie.

183
00:17:55,938 --> 00:17:57,971
Oh, yeah. Oh! I'm gonna come.

184
00:17:58,006 --> 00:18:00,600
Yeah. You like that?

185
00:18:01,846 --> 00:18:04,646
Hey. Oh, come on. Give us a kiss.
SEAN: Get the fuck off me.

186
00:18:04,681 --> 00:18:06,211
Oooh!

187
00:18:06,246 --> 00:18:07,804
What - we're not good enough
for you, Seanie?

188
00:18:09,806 --> 00:18:11,364
You're fuckin' pathetic.

189
00:18:13,646 --> 00:18:15,182
Fucking cock jockey!

190
00:18:15,217 --> 00:18:16,718
GIRL: Hey, babe.

191
00:18:18,446 --> 00:18:19,931
Hey, guys.

192
00:18:19,966 --> 00:18:21,806
She's always looking at him.

193
00:18:21,841 --> 00:18:23,717
Oh, whatever.
She is!

194
00:18:29,366 --> 00:18:31,118
What the fuck are you doing?

195
00:18:33,126 --> 00:18:34,559
Get out!

196
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,126
What IS wrong with him?

197
00:18:43,161 --> 00:18:44,651
Probably stoned.

198
00:18:44,686 --> 00:18:46,119
It's disgusting.

199
00:18:50,646 --> 00:18:52,079
Fuck.

200
00:18:53,286 --> 00:18:55,406
Did you hear about
Griggs having cancer?

201
00:18:55,441 --> 00:18:57,491
Shit - is it bad?

202
00:18:57,526 --> 00:18:59,366
I don't know. Think so.

203
00:18:59,401 --> 00:19:01,171
That's sad.
It is.

204
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:03,611
Alright. How do I look?
You look hot.

205
00:19:03,646 --> 00:19:05,841
Alrighty. I'll see you after.
Alright. See you later.

206
00:19:36,726 --> 00:19:38,451
GIRL: Hey, Sarah!
Hey!

207
00:19:38,486 --> 00:19:40,686
Can you wait two minutes?
Yeah. I'll meet you down there.

208
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,119
Alright. See ya.
See ya!

209
00:19:44,966 --> 00:19:47,011
BO Y: Come on, give us a kiss.

210
00:19:47,046 --> 00:19:50,243
What - we're not
good enough for you, Seanie?

211
00:19:51,446 --> 00:19:53,038
SEAN: You're fuckin' pathetic.

212
00:19:55,566 --> 00:19:57,246
BO Y: Fucking cock jockey!

213
00:19:57,281 --> 00:19:58,918
Hey, babe.

214
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:02,759
Hey, guys.

215
00:20:04,206 --> 00:20:05,686
We're gonna cruise, Lukey.

216
00:20:05,721 --> 00:20:07,119
See ya.

217
00:20:09,286 --> 00:20:10,806
Uh... I gotta go.

218
00:20:10,841 --> 00:20:12,326
Oh, I just got here!

219
00:20:12,361 --> 00:20:13,918
See ya.

220
00:20:15,126 --> 00:20:16,986
Hey. Where's Luke going?

221
00:20:17,021 --> 00:20:18,811
His class or something.

222
00:20:18,846 --> 00:20:21,046
Where were you?
Oh, this student video thing.

223
00:20:21,081 --> 00:20:22,566
Oh.
Are you gonna do it?

224
00:20:22,601 --> 00:20:24,131
No.

225
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:26,166
So, uh, how are things with Luke?

226
00:20:26,201 --> 00:20:27,645
Mmm, yeah, OK.

227
00:20:30,246 --> 00:20:32,526
What is wrong with him?
I know. It's disgusting.

228
00:20:32,561 --> 00:20:34,691
That... that is gross.

229
00:20:34,726 --> 00:20:36,717
I'm not touching that rail.

230
00:20:38,006 --> 00:20:39,997
WOMAN ON PHONE:
Shouldn't you be at school?

231
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:46,317
Yeah. I AM at school.
I'm at a payphone.

232
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,811
So, how's your holiday?

233
00:20:51,846 --> 00:20:54,042
Oh, God. It's so sunny down here.

234
00:20:54,077 --> 00:20:56,238
I wish you were here with me.

235
00:20:58,326 --> 00:20:59,771
Yeah.

236
00:20:59,806 --> 00:21:01,566
How's your father?

237
00:21:01,601 --> 00:21:03,451
He's OK.

238
00:21:03,486 --> 00:21:05,666
I haven't really seen him.

239
00:21:05,701 --> 00:21:07,733
He's interstate at the moment.

240
00:21:07,768 --> 00:21:09,766
What?! He left you guys alone?

241
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:12,011
No...

242
00:21:12,046 --> 00:21:14,886
Please don't tell him.
I wasn't meant to say anything.

243
00:21:14,921 --> 00:21:16,331
Unbelievable.

244
00:21:16,366 --> 00:21:17,966
How did you get to school?

245
00:21:18,001 --> 00:21:19,926
Marcus drove us.

246
00:21:19,961 --> 00:21:21,439
Typical.

247
00:21:24,046 --> 00:21:25,957
Anyway, I just...

248
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:29,363
...I just rang to say that I miss you.

249
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,521
Is everything alright? Are you OK?

250
00:21:36,366 --> 00:21:38,622
Yeah.
OK, sweetie.

251
00:21:38,657 --> 00:21:40,878
Gotta run. Love you.

252
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:44,806
Love you too.

253
00:21:44,841 --> 00:21:46,651
Hey, Melody?

254
00:21:46,686 --> 00:21:49,011
You still there?
Yeah.

255
00:21:49,046 --> 00:21:51,037
Take care of your brother, OK?

256
00:21:53,846 --> 00:21:56,291
OK.

257
00:21:56,326 --> 00:21:58,566
MELODY: My parents really push
my brother into things,

258
00:21:58,601 --> 00:22:02,166
like school, music.

259
00:22:02,201 --> 00:22:03,724
Everything.

260
00:22:05,246 --> 00:22:07,316
It was just so different
with me, though.

261
00:22:08,446 --> 00:22:11,286
You know, any time
I started getting good at something -

262
00:22:11,321 --> 00:22:16,606
piano or dance,
or basically anything arty -

263
00:22:16,641 --> 00:22:18,915
Dad would just stop paying lessons.

264
00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:25,724
It's like... it's like he hated me
being good at things.

265
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:30,119
Hell, he wouldn't even
let me listen to music.

266
00:22:33,206 --> 00:22:34,651
He's weird.

267
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:37,280
And I know that sounds stupid.
I know that.

268
00:22:38,766 --> 00:22:43,926
But... that's just the way it seems.

269
00:22:43,961 --> 00:22:46,171
That's good. That's good.

270
00:22:46,206 --> 00:22:48,766
You've shown some really
perceptive discussion

271
00:22:48,801 --> 00:22:52,006
on the legal side of
same-sex marriage

272
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:54,011
and the legal side of adoption.

273
00:22:54,046 --> 00:22:57,406
But what about the kids
in this whole issue?

274
00:22:57,441 --> 00:22:58,931
How are they going to be affected?

275
00:22:58,966 --> 00:23:03,166
What's going to be their place
in this complicated jigsaw?

276
00:23:03,201 --> 00:23:04,131
Yeah.

277
00:23:04,166 --> 00:23:06,106
Um... I don't really think it matters.

278
00:23:06,141 --> 00:23:08,046
If you have parents
that are the same sex

279
00:23:08,081 --> 00:23:09,491
or male and female

280
00:23:09,526 --> 00:23:11,966
they're still gonna
get the same amount of love,

281
00:23:12,001 --> 00:23:14,286
and the kids are gonna be
brought up fine.

282
00:23:14,321 --> 00:23:19,011
I can kind of see, though, if...

283
00:23:19,046 --> 00:23:22,286
Other people, they'll probably
look at 'em differently, I reckon.

284
00:23:22,321 --> 00:23:25,103
TEACHER: Why would they
look at them differently?

285
00:23:25,138 --> 00:23:27,886
Well, I mean, obviously
people are gonna find out

286
00:23:27,921 --> 00:23:29,731
that his parents are gay,

287
00:23:29,766 --> 00:23:34,806
so, you know, he's gonna get
harassed and teased at school.

288
00:23:34,841 --> 00:23:37,771
You know, it's just rude
and it's unfair.

289
00:23:37,806 --> 00:23:40,046
Exactly, yeah - that kid
would have to put up with

290
00:23:40,081 --> 00:23:41,491
all of the torment that he'd get

291
00:23:41,526 --> 00:23:43,371
because his parents
made the selfish choice

292
00:23:43,406 --> 00:23:45,526
to have that relationship
and then bring them into it.

293
00:23:45,561 --> 00:23:47,006
What - you're saying
that it's selfish

294
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:48,531
for two people to have a child,

295
00:23:48,566 --> 00:23:51,006
for two loving people to bring
a kid into a loving family?

296
00:23:51,041 --> 00:23:52,451
Is that what you're saying?
BO Y: No.

297
00:23:52,486 --> 00:23:55,926
It's just it's not natural for
two... two gay men to have a kid.

298
00:23:55,961 --> 00:23:57,566
It's got nothing to do with 'natural'.

299
00:23:57,601 --> 00:23:59,011
If two people love each other

300
00:23:59,046 --> 00:24:01,046
they should be able to bring
and raise a child...

301
00:24:01,081 --> 00:24:02,491
It's not about love.

302
00:24:02,526 --> 00:24:04,586
They've never been able
to adopt a kid before.

303
00:24:04,621 --> 00:24:06,646
God made Adam and Eve,
not Adam and Steve.

304
00:24:06,681 --> 00:24:08,091
That's fucking bullshit, mate.

305
00:24:08,126 --> 00:24:09,606
You're referring to
a Bible reference.

306
00:24:09,641 --> 00:24:11,051
It's a creation story - it's a myth!

307
00:24:11,086 --> 00:24:13,051
BO Y 2: If two dudes
are bringing up a kid,

308
00:24:13,086 --> 00:24:15,726
of course the kid's gonna be
a fag in the end, aren't they?

309
00:24:15,761 --> 00:24:17,691
You're fucking ignorant, mate.
TEACHER: Sean...

310
00:24:17,726 --> 00:24:19,366
You're fucking ignorant.
TEACHER: Settle. Come on. Hey.

311
00:24:19,401 --> 00:24:20,971
My fucking parents
are straight as an arrow.

312
00:24:21,006 --> 00:24:23,806
BO Y 2: Look at you - you're a fag.
TEACHER: Matt, that's enough.

313
00:24:23,841 --> 00:24:26,011
You're trying to inflict it
on the rest of us.

314
00:24:26,046 --> 00:24:28,126
TEACHER: Hey, whoa. Whoa.
This is not a personal discussion.

315
00:24:28,161 --> 00:24:30,251
It's a discussion about issues, OK?

316
00:24:30,286 --> 00:24:32,926
What's the issue that
you are trying to direct here?

317
00:24:32,961 --> 00:24:34,803
Keep your personal stuff out of it.

318
00:24:39,486 --> 00:24:42,366
G'day, mate. Bit early today?

319
00:24:42,401 --> 00:24:43,811
Yeah.

320
00:24:43,846 --> 00:24:45,677
Hey, I heard you playing before.

321
00:24:46,726 --> 00:24:48,171
I didn't know you were musical.

322
00:24:48,206 --> 00:24:52,286
Oh, I've been playing
since I was a little kid.

323
00:24:52,321 --> 00:24:54,563
Yeah? Well, it shows.
Thanks.

324
00:24:54,598 --> 00:24:56,806
Hey, I, uh... I read your story.

325
00:24:56,841 --> 00:24:59,363
Yeah?
Yeah! Yeah.

326
00:24:59,398 --> 00:25:01,851
I, uh... I liked it.

327
00:25:01,886 --> 00:25:04,326
Thanks.
Sounds like you're in love, huh?

328
00:25:06,326 --> 00:25:09,371
Hey, listen, about that, your story,

329
00:25:09,406 --> 00:25:12,646
uh, I mean, this is just
a formality, but, um...

330
00:25:12,681 --> 00:25:15,366
'Formality'? What do you mean?

331
00:25:15,401 --> 00:25:17,691
It's sort of...

332
00:25:17,726 --> 00:25:21,326
I was thinking about it
last night, and, um...

333
00:25:21,361 --> 00:25:23,491
Wh... You know it's my piece.

334
00:25:23,526 --> 00:25:26,206
I haven't copied it.
Oh, of course. No, it's not that.

335
00:25:26,241 --> 00:25:30,566
It's, uh... well, it's...

336
00:25:30,601 --> 00:25:32,171
It's the content.

337
00:25:32,206 --> 00:25:35,006
What are you trying to say?

338
00:25:35,041 --> 00:25:36,451
Well, it's, uh...

339
00:25:36,486 --> 00:25:38,306
I mean, I'm sure you'll
agree it's not a story

340
00:25:38,341 --> 00:25:40,091
that every Tom, Dick and Harry
would write.

341
00:25:40,126 --> 00:25:42,866
And it touched upon some very
sensitive and erotic issues.

342
00:25:42,901 --> 00:25:45,606
Yeah, alright, but you understand
that it's just a story.

343
00:25:45,641 --> 00:25:47,051
I know, I know, I know.

344
00:25:47,086 --> 00:25:50,646
But, um... let me
put it to you this way.

345
00:25:50,681 --> 00:25:52,091
If someone came in here

346
00:25:52,126 --> 00:25:54,166
and wrote a story about
shooting up the whole school

347
00:25:54,201 --> 00:25:56,246
it would be my responsibility
to check it out.

348
00:25:56,281 --> 00:25:57,691
Right, I understand that.

349
00:25:57,726 --> 00:25:59,726
But this story isn't about
shooting up the whole school.

350
00:25:59,761 --> 00:26:01,331
It's a love story, for Christ's sake.

351
00:26:01,366 --> 00:26:03,051
Did you write it about
anyone in particular?

352
00:26:03,086 --> 00:26:05,211
No, I didn't,
and everybody's been asking me that,

353
00:26:05,246 --> 00:26:09,166
and it wasn't about anyone
and it wasn't written FOR anyone.

354
00:26:09,201 --> 00:26:10,771
It's just a story. That's all it is.

355
00:26:10,806 --> 00:26:13,646
And if I showed it to someone -
say, uh, your father?

356
00:26:13,681 --> 00:26:15,766
No! Why would you show it to him?
OK, relax.

357
00:26:15,801 --> 00:26:18,091
No, I can't relax!

358
00:26:18,126 --> 00:26:20,131
It doesn't even have
anything to do with him.

359
00:26:20,166 --> 00:26:23,486
And, look, I wrote the story
because I wanted to be...

360
00:26:23,521 --> 00:26:24,971
Morning, guys.

361
00:26:25,006 --> 00:26:26,606
I wanted it to be
controversial and different

362
00:26:26,641 --> 00:26:28,171
so I could win, and I did win.

363
00:26:28,206 --> 00:26:29,806
You did.
And that's what it's about.

364
00:26:29,841 --> 00:26:32,211
Forget I said anything, OK?

365
00:26:32,246 --> 00:26:35,326
It's all good. Stop worrying.
OK.

366
00:26:35,361 --> 00:26:37,491
OK, guys.

367
00:26:37,526 --> 00:26:39,646
Now, if you can get your books
straight out today

368
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:41,571
and, uh, open up to page 24.

369
00:26:41,606 --> 00:26:44,359
We are studying the Scottish play.

370
00:26:45,486 --> 00:26:48,731
I remember one time, um...

371
00:26:48,766 --> 00:26:51,171
...we had this babysitter, and...

372
00:26:51,206 --> 00:26:53,566
This is when Mum and Dad
were still together.

373
00:26:53,601 --> 00:26:56,011
But, anyway, we had this babysitter,

374
00:26:56,046 --> 00:27:00,486
and Melody and I fell...
well, Melody fell asleep.

375
00:27:00,521 --> 00:27:04,877
I was still half-awake.

376
00:27:06,046 --> 00:27:07,611
And Mum and Dad got home

377
00:27:07,646 --> 00:27:09,971
and they... they paid the babysitter

378
00:27:10,006 --> 00:27:16,086
and... Dad... Dad didn't even wait
until they got into the bedroom.

379
00:27:16,121 --> 00:27:20,286
I don't know, I guess he thought
that we were both asleep,

380
00:27:20,321 --> 00:27:24,651
but, um... I remember he just
ripped off her clothes

381
00:27:24,686 --> 00:27:27,806
and just started fucking her, like,
right then and there on the couch.

382
00:27:27,841 --> 00:27:30,684
And I know I should be disgusted -
like, I know that.

383
00:27:32,046 --> 00:27:35,436
I was... Well, it's not like I was...

384
00:27:37,766 --> 00:27:40,678
I dunno, I... I guess
I still think about it.

385
00:27:43,246 --> 00:27:45,840
Hey, guys. Hey.

386
00:27:47,726 --> 00:27:49,159
How you going?

387
00:27:51,766 --> 00:27:53,199
Alright. I'll feed you.

388
00:28:02,446 --> 00:28:04,118
Hey, babies.

389
00:28:05,806 --> 00:28:07,406
Come up. Out the way.

390
00:28:07,441 --> 00:28:09,601
There we go.

391
00:28:11,446 --> 00:28:13,006
Hey, sweetie.

392
00:28:13,041 --> 00:28:15,011
Hello!

393
00:28:15,046 --> 00:28:16,526
You're getting big.

394
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:18,571
Yeah.

395
00:28:18,606 --> 00:28:20,446
You little cutie, huh?

396
00:28:20,481 --> 00:28:22,006
You remember me.

397
00:28:22,041 --> 00:28:24,091
Aww.

398
00:28:24,126 --> 00:28:25,726
Don't be scared.

399
00:28:25,761 --> 00:28:27,205
It's OK.

400
00:28:28,686 --> 00:28:32,046
Hey, what's going on in there, huh?

401
00:28:32,081 --> 00:28:34,002
Hey, Melody.

402
00:28:42,446 --> 00:28:44,243
You've been really great
with the animals this term.

403
00:28:45,646 --> 00:28:47,486
She's a cute one, isn't she, Daisy?

404
00:28:47,521 --> 00:28:49,522
Yeah. She is.

405
00:28:51,006 --> 00:28:53,926
Hey, you know, someone has to take
them home each week for the weekend.

406
00:28:53,961 --> 00:28:56,246
Maybe you could take...
No.

407
00:28:56,281 --> 00:28:57,846
My brother's allergic.

408
00:28:57,881 --> 00:28:59,971
Marcus?
Yeah.

409
00:29:00,006 --> 00:29:01,931
Everything alright?

410
00:29:01,966 --> 00:29:04,371
Yeah, everything's fine.

411
00:29:04,406 --> 00:29:06,606
Fuck, this is boring as shit.

412
00:29:06,641 --> 00:29:08,051
Bloody reffo.

413
00:29:08,086 --> 00:29:10,286
I reckon someone should
sew his lips together.

414
00:29:10,321 --> 00:29:12,038
TEACHER: Luke! Tom!

415
00:29:26,846 --> 00:29:28,837
TEACHER: Right, get out of here now.
Both of you.

416
00:29:39,046 --> 00:29:41,286
Hey, what do you reckon of
that Clare chick in there?

417
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:43,011
The fat one?
She's not fat!

418
00:29:43,046 --> 00:29:45,466
Nah, huge, man.
She's got good tits, though, man.

419
00:29:45,501 --> 00:29:47,886
My girl has twice the tits
and half the frame.

420
00:29:47,921 --> 00:29:49,486
Yeah, but that's Sarah, you know?

421
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:50,931
I mean, she's like a twig.

422
00:29:50,966 --> 00:29:52,766
Go too hard on Sarah
you could break her...

423
00:29:52,801 --> 00:29:54,366
...if you've got a small cock.

424
00:29:54,401 --> 00:29:55,811
Virgin!

425
00:29:55,846 --> 00:29:57,646
Shut the fuck up, man.

426
00:29:57,681 --> 00:29:59,079
What?

427
00:30:02,806 --> 00:30:04,319
Cheers.

428
00:30:08,526 --> 00:30:10,251
I was thinking, right,

429
00:30:10,286 --> 00:30:12,246
I reckon I wanna arsefuck her.

430
00:30:12,281 --> 00:30:14,362
Sarah?
Yeah.

431
00:30:16,086 --> 00:30:17,531
What's wrong with that, man?

432
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:19,746
You wanna arsefuck her?
Nothing gay, man.

433
00:30:19,781 --> 00:30:21,926
No, you just wanna
put your cock in her...

434
00:30:21,961 --> 00:30:23,439
Fuck you.
Oi, check it out.

435
00:30:30,686 --> 00:30:32,119
TEACHER: What is that smell?

436
00:30:36,486 --> 00:30:38,522
TEACHER: Steven?

437
00:30:40,086 --> 00:30:41,731
Steven!

438
00:30:41,766 --> 00:30:43,324
Can I see you outside?

439
00:30:47,606 --> 00:30:49,562
Oh!

440
00:31:00,726 --> 00:31:02,364
What is the matter with you?

441
00:31:06,166 --> 00:31:07,599
Steven, I'm speaking to you.

442
00:31:11,846 --> 00:31:13,916
A bit old for this sort of thing,
aren't you?

443
00:31:17,206 --> 00:31:18,846
You'd better go
and get yourself cleaned up

444
00:31:18,881 --> 00:31:20,486
then you'd better go
and see the counsellor.

445
00:31:20,521 --> 00:31:23,000
Mr Darcy, my bag and books...

446
00:31:25,486 --> 00:31:26,965
...are inside.

447
00:31:42,686 --> 00:31:44,836
Aren't we lucky
it wasn't number twos.

448
00:32:07,646 --> 00:32:11,566
LUKE: I was thinking, right -
I reckon I wanna arsefuck her.

449
00:32:11,601 --> 00:32:13,318
TOM: Sarah?
LUKE: Yeah.

450
00:32:15,366 --> 00:32:18,166
LUKE: What's wrong with that, man?
TOM: You wanna arsefuck her?

451
00:32:18,201 --> 00:32:19,611
Nothing gay, man.

452
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,366
No, you just wanna
put your cock in her...

453
00:32:21,401 --> 00:32:23,086
LUKE: Fuck you.
TOM: Oi, check it out.

454
00:32:23,121 --> 00:32:25,051
Hey, how you going, Uneven Steven?

455
00:32:25,086 --> 00:32:27,646
Steve, are you alright, bro?
You had an accident?

456
00:32:27,681 --> 00:32:29,939
You've pissed yourself, man.
That's horrible.

457
00:32:29,974 --> 00:32:32,197
You reek, mate!
Watch out! Watch out! Stairs!

458
00:32:35,366 --> 00:32:37,486
LUKE: Shit, that sucks.

459
00:32:37,521 --> 00:32:39,158
Oh, wait up, man!

460
00:33:05,526 --> 00:33:06,971
I didn't mean to do it.

461
00:33:07,006 --> 00:33:10,701
I mean, it's not like...
it's not like I can control it.

462
00:33:10,736 --> 00:33:14,396
Before I knew it, it was...
my trousers were just wet.

463
00:33:16,406 --> 00:33:18,522
It's just like a routine now.

464
00:33:20,686 --> 00:33:25,406
My parents, they used to send me
with these... with perfume to school

465
00:33:25,441 --> 00:33:26,891
to try and mask the smell,

466
00:33:26,926 --> 00:33:29,851
but... that was pretty hopeless.

467
00:33:29,886 --> 00:33:31,926
And then they tried -
well, we tried -

468
00:33:31,961 --> 00:33:33,371
these pad thingies,

469
00:33:33,406 --> 00:33:36,006
and I think they were meant to
absorb the wee, but...

470
00:33:36,041 --> 00:33:38,846
...God, that was a stupid idea.

471
00:33:38,881 --> 00:33:40,371
That didn't work either.

472
00:33:40,406 --> 00:33:43,131
So now the only thing
that I can really do

473
00:33:43,166 --> 00:33:46,606
is pack the same pair of trousers
that I'm wearing that day

474
00:33:46,641 --> 00:33:49,011
and underwear

475
00:33:49,046 --> 00:33:51,686
and then take them to school
and... yeah.

476
00:33:51,721 --> 00:33:53,802
That... I suppose that works, but...

477
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:59,726
...some days I go...
I wet myself more than once,

478
00:33:59,761 --> 00:34:02,239
and it's frustrating.

479
00:34:02,274 --> 00:34:04,717
It's embarrassing.

480
00:37:01,486 --> 00:37:03,716
MELODY: Sure, we think
we have family and friends.

481
00:37:05,406 --> 00:37:06,839
But when stuff happens...

482
00:37:09,646 --> 00:37:14,117
...when really serious
stuff happens...

483
00:37:18,206 --> 00:37:19,719
...you just feel so alone.

484
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:23,798
And you can't tell people.

485
00:37:25,446 --> 00:37:27,004
I mean, they'll probably listen.

486
00:37:28,686 --> 00:37:30,438
But they don't know everything.

487
00:37:32,846 --> 00:37:34,325
In fact, they don't know anything.

488
00:37:38,406 --> 00:37:42,684
There's just...
some stuff you can't share.

489
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:48,239
So, what do you do then?

490
00:37:51,966 --> 00:37:54,046
GIRL: He is really beautiful.

491
00:37:54,081 --> 00:37:56,480
Which one?
Luke.

492
00:37:58,406 --> 00:37:59,886
I know you think he is.

493
00:37:59,921 --> 00:38:02,157
Yeah, he is.

494
00:38:02,192 --> 00:38:04,394
So, um...

495
00:38:05,766 --> 00:38:08,891
...would you, uh... would you fuck him?

496
00:38:08,926 --> 00:38:12,805
Sorry. I mean, um,
would you give him your virginity?

497
00:38:15,366 --> 00:38:17,197
So, did you hear Michael's
back in hospital?

498
00:38:18,486 --> 00:38:21,286
Yeah, I... I heard.
SARAH: Slut.

499
00:38:21,321 --> 00:38:23,356
Fucking bitch.

500
00:38:24,446 --> 00:38:26,091
Don't worry about it.

501
00:38:26,126 --> 00:38:28,126
No. Who the hell
does she think she is?

502
00:38:28,161 --> 00:38:30,246
Seriously, don't worry about it.

503
00:38:30,281 --> 00:38:31,691
Anyway, I gotta go.

504
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:34,877
OK, well, I'll see you at 4:00?
Yeah.

505
00:39:40,206 --> 00:39:42,674
SARAH: I can't believe it.
She was right there with it.

506
00:39:44,366 --> 00:39:46,446
Well, what was it?
It was positive.

507
00:39:46,481 --> 00:39:47,971
Fuck.

508
00:39:48,006 --> 00:39:49,451
So she's pregnant?

509
00:39:49,486 --> 00:39:51,851
Wait. Sarah, tell me
exactly what happened.

510
00:39:51,886 --> 00:39:55,006
She stopped and I... and I saw her.
What was I supposed to do, huh?

511
00:39:55,041 --> 00:39:57,481
Never thought she'd get a fuck.
Bullshit.

512
00:39:57,516 --> 00:39:59,921
Whose do you
think it is, then?

513
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:03,891
Sarah, come on.
Nah.

514
00:40:03,926 --> 00:40:05,966
Don't do this to me, Sarah.
You don't understand.

515
00:40:06,001 --> 00:40:07,971
She's with him more than I am.
Look, he loves you.

516
00:40:08,006 --> 00:40:10,566
You know he does. This is stupid.
You do this every time!

517
00:40:10,601 --> 00:40:12,796
Look, it's his. I know it.

518
00:40:15,166 --> 00:40:16,931
Slut.

519
00:40:16,966 --> 00:40:19,726
Fucking bitch.
MELODY: Don't worry about it.

520
00:40:19,761 --> 00:40:21,646
No. Who the hell does
she think she is?

521
00:40:21,681 --> 00:40:23,079
Hey, babe.

522
00:40:27,726 --> 00:40:30,365
I gotta go.
Oh, babe. Just a minute?

523
00:40:32,966 --> 00:40:34,399
Sorry.

524
00:40:41,486 --> 00:40:43,954
SARAH: God, they were all
so jealous of Luke and I.

525
00:40:45,006 --> 00:40:48,086
He had his pick of every girl
in the school and he chose me.

526
00:40:48,121 --> 00:40:50,326
It's not like I tried
to trick him or anything.

527
00:40:50,361 --> 00:40:51,771
I didn't.

528
00:40:51,806 --> 00:40:54,466
I can trust him. I know I can.

529
00:40:54,501 --> 00:40:57,091
But girls can be so bitchy,

530
00:40:57,126 --> 00:40:59,594
and, frankly, they'll do anything
to get what they want.

531
00:41:01,046 --> 00:41:02,684
It's not always the guy's fault.

532
00:41:12,446 --> 00:41:15,246
STEVEN: At home I've got
this list of, um...

533
00:41:15,281 --> 00:41:16,811
...all the football greats,

534
00:41:16,846 --> 00:41:21,874
like Beckham and Ronaldo
and Zidane and all of them.

535
00:41:27,006 --> 00:41:29,474
One day I'm gonna be on that list.

536
00:41:50,526 --> 00:41:52,011
STEVEN: And this is
Steven's comeback game.

537
00:41:52,046 --> 00:41:54,451
He's been out for about a year
with a leg injury now,

538
00:41:54,486 --> 00:41:57,206
and what an important comeback game
this one is set to be.

539
00:41:57,241 --> 00:41:59,011
He's just gotten
his first touch of the game

540
00:41:59,046 --> 00:42:01,926
and it looks to be a good'un -
interception at the halfway line.

541
00:42:01,961 --> 00:42:03,406
He takes it round one defender.

542
00:42:03,441 --> 00:42:04,851
Oh, skips past another

543
00:42:04,886 --> 00:42:07,006
and he's gone past Ronaldo
like he's not even there.

544
00:42:07,041 --> 00:42:08,771
He lays it off.
This is brilliant play.

545
00:42:08,806 --> 00:42:11,446
He gets it back at the edge
of the box and he shoots,

546
00:42:11,481 --> 00:42:12,966
and it's straight into
the top-right corner!

547
00:42:13,001 --> 00:42:15,131
Oh, and the crowd go wild!

548
00:42:15,166 --> 00:42:17,606
This is absolutely brilliant play
by Steven and England.

549
00:42:17,641 --> 00:42:20,566
Wembley hasn't seen
play like this since '66.

550
00:42:20,601 --> 00:42:22,761
The Brazilians are gutted.

551
00:42:54,886 --> 00:42:57,451
MARCUS: I was watching
one of those courtroom dramas,

552
00:42:57,486 --> 00:43:01,786
and, uh, there's that moment when
the jury come out of deliberation

553
00:43:01,821 --> 00:43:06,086
and they tell the judge whether
or not this guy's gonna be guilty.

554
00:43:06,121 --> 00:43:10,331
Oh, the tension is so thick you...

555
00:43:10,366 --> 00:43:12,322
...you actually could cut it
with a knife.

556
00:43:13,366 --> 00:43:15,506
I mean, that's what
it was like when, um,

557
00:43:15,541 --> 00:43:17,611
when we get a test
or an assignment back.

558
00:43:17,646 --> 00:43:21,486
You know, you just avoid all
the scribble on all of the pages

559
00:43:21,521 --> 00:43:23,636
and you just head straight
to the verdict.

560
00:43:25,406 --> 00:43:27,326
I mean, I usually do pretty well.

561
00:43:27,361 --> 00:43:28,759
Um...

562
00:43:30,886 --> 00:43:34,886
...but, you know,
those few times, um,

563
00:43:34,921 --> 00:43:38,006
I heard that guilty verdict

564
00:43:38,041 --> 00:43:39,997
it was my dad.

565
00:43:43,806 --> 00:43:45,797
Yeah, he really tore me up.

566
00:43:47,486 --> 00:43:50,086
You know, he's always, like,
"Oh, yeah, yeah, it's good,

567
00:43:50,121 --> 00:43:52,171
"but, um... is it good enough?"

568
00:43:52,206 --> 00:43:56,324
And everything always just has to
be so fucking perfect with him.

569
00:44:06,286 --> 00:44:07,844
He's... he's usually right, though.

570
00:45:01,846 --> 00:45:03,291
Marcus.

571
00:45:03,326 --> 00:45:05,966
Yeah, look, um, I just...
I just saw my mark for the test.

572
00:45:06,001 --> 00:45:07,851
Yeah, 87. Not bad.

573
00:45:07,886 --> 00:45:11,646
Yeah, I know it's pretty good,
but I need three more per cent.

574
00:45:11,681 --> 00:45:14,171
Well, there's no
negotiating of marks.

575
00:45:14,206 --> 00:45:15,806
Look, I understand that
in any other circumstance,

576
00:45:15,841 --> 00:45:17,251
and that would be fine...

577
00:45:17,286 --> 00:45:19,406
No, no, in ALL circumstances
we don't change the marks.

578
00:45:19,441 --> 00:45:20,851
Look, please, you don't understand.

579
00:45:20,886 --> 00:45:22,726
If you could just check over
that paper once,

580
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:24,171
I'm sure we can find it!

581
00:45:24,206 --> 00:45:26,446
No, I'm not checking anything.
Please. Put my mind at rest.

582
00:45:26,481 --> 00:45:28,483
Look, Marcus, if you wanna
continue with this nonsense

583
00:45:28,518 --> 00:45:30,486
we can talk about lowering
your overall mark by 5%.

584
00:45:30,521 --> 00:45:32,331
Mrs Jacobs, look,
you don't understand!

585
00:45:32,366 --> 00:45:34,834
Goodbye, Marcus. Goodbye, Marcus.
Please!

586
00:45:37,246 --> 00:45:38,679
Fuck!

587
00:45:47,726 --> 00:45:49,796
Hey. I got the music you were after.

588
00:45:56,726 --> 00:45:58,171
What's up with you?

589
00:45:58,206 --> 00:45:59,844
She wouldn't even fucking
listen to me.

590
00:46:01,166 --> 00:46:02,724
Who?
Jacobs.

591
00:46:05,366 --> 00:46:07,204
I needed 90%.

592
00:46:07,239 --> 00:46:09,042
What did you get?

593
00:46:12,486 --> 00:46:14,716
87's awesome.
What are you talking about?

594
00:46:16,926 --> 00:46:18,359
Marcus...

595
00:46:21,926 --> 00:46:24,846
I think, um, most people
probably see me

596
00:46:24,881 --> 00:46:27,599
as a geek or a nerd or whatever.

597
00:46:30,206 --> 00:46:32,286
They never really give me
much trouble, though.

598
00:46:32,321 --> 00:46:33,731
I... I don't know.

599
00:46:33,766 --> 00:46:38,246
But the odd times that they do
give me a bit of grief,

600
00:46:38,281 --> 00:46:42,051
I just look at them
and think to myself,

601
00:46:42,086 --> 00:46:44,966
"Well, in five years
you'll be on fucking welfare

602
00:46:45,001 --> 00:46:47,799
"and serving me at McDonald's, so..."

603
00:46:52,406 --> 00:46:56,194
Yeah, well... that's
a comforting thought.

604
00:47:02,126 --> 00:47:04,082
Get back to your mum.

605
00:47:07,286 --> 00:47:10,726
Hey, dude.
Look who's checking you out, man.

606
00:47:10,761 --> 00:47:12,171
Which one?

607
00:47:12,206 --> 00:47:13,926
The fucking blonde one.
What's her name?

608
00:47:13,961 --> 00:47:16,171
Mel.
Melody, man.

609
00:47:16,206 --> 00:47:18,046
You're gonna be singing
to that tune all night.

610
00:47:20,246 --> 00:47:22,651
Melody!

611
00:47:22,686 --> 00:47:24,526
I've known her since
I was, like, six, man.

612
00:47:24,561 --> 00:47:25,971
Whatever, man.

613
00:47:26,006 --> 00:47:28,166
Look, you've gotta tell me that
with a straight face.

614
00:47:28,201 --> 00:47:30,441
Tell me you wouldn't want
a piece of that arse.

615
00:47:33,126 --> 00:47:34,906
Did you see that look?
I saw that look, man.

616
00:47:34,941 --> 00:47:37,433
You've fucking done her already,
haven't you?

617
00:47:37,468 --> 00:47:39,891
Did you fuck her in the arse?
Was it tight?

618
00:47:39,926 --> 00:47:41,926
Look, man, you're with your boys.
You can tell us.

619
00:47:41,961 --> 00:47:42,891
Nuh.

620
00:47:42,926 --> 00:47:45,726
You took her home,
you stroked her hair,

621
00:47:45,761 --> 00:47:47,806
and you fucked her up the ar...

622
00:47:47,841 --> 00:47:50,161
Fuck off, yeah?

623
00:48:16,246 --> 00:48:17,679
BO Y: You alright, Luke?

624
00:48:59,966 --> 00:49:02,066
LUKE: It's all a fucking game
at school, you know?

625
00:49:02,101 --> 00:49:04,213
I mean, the shit that
goes on there - seriously.

626
00:49:04,248 --> 00:49:06,291
Yeah, I'll give someone shit,
I'll pay him out,

627
00:49:06,326 --> 00:49:09,166
but I doubt he's gonna go home
and cry himself to sleep over it.

628
00:49:09,201 --> 00:49:10,611
You know, you've gotta be tough,

629
00:49:10,646 --> 00:49:12,886
otherwise people will stomp you
down to the fucking ground.

630
00:49:12,921 --> 00:49:15,126
It's a jungle - and if you can't
fake your way through school,

631
00:49:15,161 --> 00:49:17,606
how the fuck are you gonna make it
in the real world?

632
00:49:17,641 --> 00:49:19,039
Huh? Tell me that.

633
00:49:47,126 --> 00:49:48,718
You want me to call
a plumber, Steven?

634
00:50:19,406 --> 00:50:20,851
STEVEN: I love my family -

635
00:50:20,886 --> 00:50:23,811
my mum, my dad,
my brother and my sister.

636
00:50:23,846 --> 00:50:28,206
Through all of this they've been
sitting at my bedside in hospital

637
00:50:28,241 --> 00:50:31,083
or waiting in waiting rooms
when I've been in theatre.

638
00:50:31,118 --> 00:50:33,926
And they've just been brilliant
through all of this

639
00:50:33,961 --> 00:50:38,926
and... it's just been amazing,
their support.

640
00:50:38,961 --> 00:50:42,291
And now when I have trouble at school

641
00:50:42,326 --> 00:50:45,966
I just... I just don't think
I can complain to them.

642
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:47,971
I don't... I don't think I can.

643
00:50:48,006 --> 00:50:51,316
They deserve... they deserve
to have better than that now.

644
00:50:53,926 --> 00:50:55,405
Yes.

645
00:51:40,406 --> 00:51:43,478
Sean. G'day, mate. Come on through.

646
00:51:59,246 --> 00:52:03,771
What's that?
Oh, just my folks.

647
00:52:03,806 --> 00:52:07,166
They, um, they got me, like,
this dog the other day.

648
00:52:07,201 --> 00:52:08,611
Oh, cool.
Yeah.

649
00:52:08,646 --> 00:52:10,691
What sort?
Oh, it's, um...

650
00:52:10,726 --> 00:52:13,846
It's like a husky, I guess.
It looks sort of like a wolf.

651
00:52:13,881 --> 00:52:15,598
How's he settling in?

652
00:52:19,446 --> 00:52:21,084
I cut its fucking throat.

653
00:52:23,926 --> 00:52:25,484
You killed it?

654
00:52:27,326 --> 00:52:30,211
No, I'm just joking.

655
00:52:30,246 --> 00:52:31,726
It's going good. Yeah, I like it.

656
00:52:31,761 --> 00:52:34,365
OK.

657
00:52:35,486 --> 00:52:37,531
And why do you think your, um...

658
00:52:37,566 --> 00:52:39,566
Why do you think your parents
bought you a dog?

659
00:52:39,601 --> 00:52:41,011
I dunno.

660
00:52:41,046 --> 00:52:42,851
It's just... lately, I guess since...

661
00:52:42,886 --> 00:52:45,091
It's probably since I came out,
you know.

662
00:52:45,126 --> 00:52:47,466
They've been fucking
badgering me constantly about

663
00:52:47,501 --> 00:52:49,771
"Why don't you bring
any people home anymore?"

664
00:52:49,806 --> 00:52:53,726
And...... I guess it's about
they want me to have companionship.

665
00:52:53,761 --> 00:52:55,331
It just fucking shits me off,
because...

666
00:52:55,366 --> 00:52:57,966
My dad, especially,
always in my ear, constantly -

667
00:52:58,001 --> 00:52:59,411
he thinks this is a phase,

668
00:52:59,446 --> 00:53:00,966
he thinks I'm just
a teenager that...

669
00:53:01,001 --> 00:53:02,411
...this whole fucking gay thing

670
00:53:02,446 --> 00:53:04,446
is just gonna disappear,
you know what I mean?

671
00:53:04,481 --> 00:53:06,571
It's just fucking shit.
He knows I'm gay.

672
00:53:06,606 --> 00:53:08,866
He has to fucking deal with it,
and that's it.

673
00:53:08,901 --> 00:53:11,126
It's really hard for fathers
to understand.

674
00:53:11,161 --> 00:53:13,323
Oh, yeah, but I'm his kid. I'm his son.

675
00:53:13,358 --> 00:53:15,451
How fucking hard is it
to accept your kid?

676
00:53:15,486 --> 00:53:19,366
Parents want their kids
to grow up like they did.

677
00:53:19,401 --> 00:53:20,811
Big deal - did your parents, like...

678
00:53:20,846 --> 00:53:23,646
Did you grow up how your dad was?
No, I didn't. No, I didn't.

679
00:53:23,681 --> 00:53:25,091
But it's a natural parental instinct.

680
00:53:25,126 --> 00:53:27,131
I mean, parents want
their kids to be happy.

681
00:53:27,166 --> 00:53:29,486
I've been as subtle as I can
with this whole thing,

682
00:53:29,521 --> 00:53:31,556
and it's fucking
blown up in my face.

683
00:53:33,046 --> 00:53:35,765
How are things with your mum?
My mum.

684
00:53:37,206 --> 00:53:39,771
She's a fucking bitch.

685
00:53:39,806 --> 00:53:41,731
I don't even go out
with my parents anymore.

686
00:53:41,766 --> 00:53:44,446
I don't even go to the places
that they go to anymore

687
00:53:44,481 --> 00:53:47,600
because everybody knows
I'm fucking gay.

688
00:53:47,635 --> 00:53:50,720
They don't even ask me
to come anymore.

689
00:53:52,686 --> 00:53:55,686
Do you talk to your brother at all?
No, I don't talk to my brother.

690
00:53:55,721 --> 00:53:57,291
He's the complete opposite,
you know?

691
00:53:57,326 --> 00:53:59,366
He's got this career
and he's gone to uni.

692
00:53:59,401 --> 00:54:01,371
He's done it all.
He's got this woman.

693
00:54:01,406 --> 00:54:03,606
He's probably gonna get married
in a couple of years.

694
00:54:03,641 --> 00:54:06,003
Everything's going really,
really well

695
00:54:06,038 --> 00:54:08,366
and, you know, here's me fucking...

696
00:54:08,401 --> 00:54:09,891
So he's the golden boy?

697
00:54:09,926 --> 00:54:11,766
Oh, of course he's
the fucking golden boy.

698
00:54:11,801 --> 00:54:13,443
I mean, what are they
gonna get out of me?

699
00:54:13,478 --> 00:54:15,242
They're gonna get grandkids
out of him.

700
00:54:15,277 --> 00:54:17,006
I'm just their dirty little
fucking secret.

701
00:54:17,041 --> 00:54:18,451
So they're ganging up on you?

702
00:54:18,486 --> 00:54:21,762
They're not ganging up on me,
they're just both against me.

703
00:54:31,726 --> 00:54:33,362
Hey, Marcus.

704
00:54:33,397 --> 00:54:34,999
Over here.

705
00:54:36,526 --> 00:54:38,011
How you going?

706
00:54:38,046 --> 00:54:40,886
Yeah, I'm... I'm fine.

707
00:54:40,921 --> 00:54:42,604
Um... thanks.

708
00:55:02,526 --> 00:55:03,959
Hey, um...

709
00:55:06,086 --> 00:55:07,519
...I heard about your sister.

710
00:55:08,686 --> 00:55:10,324
Melody?
Yeah.

711
00:55:13,286 --> 00:55:15,726
What? What did you hear about her?
What are you talking about?

712
00:55:15,761 --> 00:55:17,637
Yeah, like, it's OK. I know.

713
00:55:19,686 --> 00:55:22,971
What are you saying?
What are you talking about?

714
00:55:23,006 --> 00:55:26,086
Marcus, look, you can talk to me
about it, you know. It's alright.

715
00:55:26,121 --> 00:55:27,963
What the fuck are you talking about?

716
00:55:29,726 --> 00:55:31,886
You mean you didn't hear?
No, I didn't fucking hear!

717
00:55:31,921 --> 00:55:33,823
What the hell are you talking about?
Shit.

718
00:55:33,858 --> 00:55:35,632
Look, I probably shouldn't
have said anything.

719
00:55:35,667 --> 00:55:37,556
Just fucking tell me!
Fucking let go, Marcus.

720
00:55:37,591 --> 00:55:39,446
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Sorry. Sorry.

721
00:55:39,481 --> 00:55:40,891
Sorry.
Jesus Christ.

722
00:55:40,926 --> 00:55:42,891
Just fucking tell me
what the fuck is going on.

723
00:55:42,926 --> 00:55:45,446
Fine, alright. I heard she
might be pregnant, alright?

724
00:55:45,481 --> 00:55:47,482
Just... Jesus.

725
00:55:52,446 --> 00:55:53,879
Who the fuck told you that?

726
00:56:10,926 --> 00:56:12,359
Yeah.

727
00:57:01,806 --> 00:57:03,731
I can't stand the whole attitude
at school.

728
00:57:03,766 --> 00:57:07,046
You know, all that politically
correct, self-righteous bullshit.

729
00:57:07,081 --> 00:57:10,326
You know, calling it my 'issues'
and calling me homo-fucking-sexual.

730
00:57:10,361 --> 00:57:11,771
You know, fuck that.

731
00:57:11,806 --> 00:57:13,966
You don't call a pussy
a vagina, do you?

732
00:57:14,001 --> 00:57:16,126
I'm fuck... I'm gay.
It's as simple as that.

733
00:57:16,161 --> 00:57:17,559
Fucking get over it.

734
00:57:47,806 --> 00:57:49,806
Fuck, I gotta go back into class.

735
00:57:49,841 --> 00:57:52,220
Oh, I got fucking Jacobs.

736
00:57:52,255 --> 00:57:54,600
Fucking... Oh, I got physics.

737
00:57:55,886 --> 00:57:58,486
I got phy...
Look at that pink fucking shit.

738
00:57:58,521 --> 00:57:59,931
How the...

739
00:57:59,966 --> 00:58:02,196
Nah, not good for the animals,
that shit. Not good.

740
00:58:03,726 --> 00:58:06,006
Blue fucking...

741
00:58:44,286 --> 00:58:46,083
So, we're OK?
Mmm.

742
00:59:16,326 --> 00:59:17,906
Where you been?

743
00:59:17,941 --> 00:59:19,451
Inside Sarah.

744
00:59:19,486 --> 00:59:21,716
You're fucking kidding me.

745
00:59:22,766 --> 00:59:24,811
No joke. I gotta take a piss.

746
00:59:24,846 --> 00:59:26,861
Remember to wipe
the shit off your cock.

747
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:28,876
Yeah, get laid first
then come talk to me.

748
01:00:08,006 --> 01:00:09,766
What's going on?

749
01:00:09,801 --> 01:00:11,491
Dude, just leave.

750
01:00:11,526 --> 01:00:13,166
You can't fucking avoid me forever.

751
01:00:13,201 --> 01:00:14,645
Just fuck off, alright?

752
01:00:23,886 --> 01:00:26,286
Don't fucking touch me!
What the fuck?

753
01:00:26,321 --> 01:00:27,731
You're pretty fucking confident

754
01:00:27,766 --> 01:00:29,606
giving me shit
in front of your mates, huh?

755
01:00:29,641 --> 01:00:31,531
You fucking macho man.
Just fuck off!

756
01:00:31,566 --> 01:00:34,126
Oh, look, everyone knows
you're fucking gay, alright?

757
01:00:34,161 --> 01:00:36,239
Fucking get over yourself.

758
01:00:36,274 --> 01:00:38,318
You fucking cunt.

759
01:00:51,086 --> 01:00:52,644
Fuck!

760
01:01:04,686 --> 01:01:07,806
Watch it!
Get the fuck out of my way!

761
01:01:07,841 --> 01:01:09,603
What the fuck?

762
01:01:29,166 --> 01:01:30,599
Motherfucker!

763
01:01:47,646 --> 01:01:49,602
SEAN: People reckon
I can't fall in love.

764
01:01:53,166 --> 01:01:54,599
But I have.

765
01:01:55,966 --> 01:01:58,211
Who is it?

766
01:01:58,246 --> 01:02:00,680
That's my business.
But it feels fucking great.

767
01:02:03,726 --> 01:02:05,171
And I know one day

768
01:02:05,206 --> 01:02:07,246
I'll be able to bring him
down to the house

769
01:02:07,281 --> 01:02:08,679
so he can meet Mum and Dad.

770
01:02:12,726 --> 01:02:15,846
And I'll make sure he sits right next
to my brother at the kitchen table.

771
01:02:15,881 --> 01:02:17,326
He'll fucking freak.

772
01:02:39,246 --> 01:02:40,966
SEAN: What's going on?

773
01:02:41,001 --> 01:02:42,651
LUKE: Dude, just leave.

774
01:02:42,686 --> 01:02:44,246
SEAN: You can't fucking
avoid me forever.

775
01:02:44,281 --> 01:02:45,725
LUKE: Just fuck off, alright?

776
01:02:56,686 --> 01:02:58,606
LUKE: Don't fucking touch me!
SEAN: What the fuck?

777
01:02:58,641 --> 01:03:00,051
You're pretty fucking confident

778
01:03:00,086 --> 01:03:02,146
giving me shit
in front of your mates, huh?

779
01:03:02,181 --> 01:03:04,171
You fucking macho man.
LUKE: Just fuck off!

780
01:03:04,206 --> 01:03:07,286
SEAN: Oh, look, everyone knows
you're fucking gay, alright?

781
01:03:07,321 --> 01:03:09,143
Fucking get over yourself.

782
01:03:09,178 --> 01:03:10,966
You fucking cunt.

783
01:03:19,646 --> 01:03:21,079
LUKE: Fuck!

784
01:03:31,966 --> 01:03:33,763
LUKE: You're fucking dead, cunt.
No, no, no. I...

785
01:03:35,166 --> 01:03:36,724
A word and you're fucked!

786
01:03:55,566 --> 01:03:59,526
BO Y: Oh, he's done it again.
GIRL: You are kidding me.

787
01:03:59,561 --> 01:04:01,198
GIRL: That's disgusting.

788
01:04:07,446 --> 01:04:10,756
STEVEN: I don't think
that people mean to be cruel.

789
01:04:12,966 --> 01:04:14,451
Mum says that they're just kids

790
01:04:14,486 --> 01:04:19,002
and... she reckons eventually
things will get better.

791
01:04:23,286 --> 01:04:25,561
School finishes in three months.

792
01:04:27,046 --> 01:04:28,638
That's 90 days.

793
01:04:31,926 --> 01:04:36,954
90 days can sometimes be
a really, really long time, though.

794
01:05:17,646 --> 01:05:20,366
GIRL: Oi. Steven, are you OK?
You're bleeding.

795
01:05:20,401 --> 01:05:22,675
I have a tissue if you want.

796
01:05:30,006 --> 01:05:31,491
Hey.

797
01:05:31,526 --> 01:05:33,523
Are you gonna be OK?

798
01:05:33,558 --> 01:05:35,521
Yeah. I'll be OK.

799
01:05:40,006 --> 01:05:41,886
MAN ON LOUDSPEAKER:
Could Simona Carboni please come to

800
01:05:41,921 --> 01:05:43,331
the science lab, thanks?

801
01:05:43,366 --> 01:05:45,834
Simona Carboni to the science lab.
Thank you.

802
01:06:13,806 --> 01:06:15,646
Hey, I've been looking for you.

803
01:06:15,681 --> 01:06:17,531
Baby, what's wrong?

804
01:06:17,566 --> 01:06:19,166
Just fuck off, alright?!

805
01:06:19,201 --> 01:06:20,884
Fuck!

806
01:06:26,566 --> 01:06:29,683
There are some thing you just
don't talk about, you know?

807
01:06:31,166 --> 01:06:33,171
I won't, alright?

808
01:06:33,206 --> 01:06:37,279
And I'm just... I'm just not going to.

809
01:06:55,519 --> 01:06:58,158
SARAH: I just love him.
I love everything about him.

810
01:06:59,759 --> 01:07:02,094
He knows more about me
than my own parents do.

811
01:07:02,129 --> 01:07:04,429
I mean, how many people
can say that at 17?

812
01:07:06,039 --> 01:07:08,004
They call us the prince and princess.

813
01:07:08,039 --> 01:07:11,399
But they don't realise
that it's not a joke to me.

814
01:07:11,434 --> 01:07:13,117
This is serious.

815
01:07:16,039 --> 01:07:17,870
I could really see us
getting married.

816
01:07:19,199 --> 01:07:22,077
What else can I say? I love him.

817
01:07:34,279 --> 01:07:36,439
COUNSELLOR: I don't think it's such
a good idea if you go home.

818
01:07:36,474 --> 01:07:40,079
Why don't you try and just go
to your next class?

819
01:07:40,114 --> 01:07:41,759
What do you think of that? Yeah?

820
01:07:41,794 --> 01:07:44,353
Yeah. OK. Yeah.
Yeah. OK.

821
01:09:59,639 --> 01:10:01,516
Oh, yeah.

822
01:10:10,279 --> 01:10:11,951
Oh, yeah.

823
01:11:58,799 --> 01:12:01,879
May I just go to the bathroom?
Yeah, of course. Are you OK?

824
01:12:01,914 --> 01:12:04,159
Yeah, I'm fine. I just have to go.

825
01:12:19,839 --> 01:12:22,307
He'd been touching me since I was 13.

826
01:12:24,959 --> 01:12:26,392
Marcus.

827
01:12:29,759 --> 01:12:32,432
But that...

828
01:12:33,919 --> 01:12:35,896
...that was the first time

829
01:12:35,931 --> 01:12:37,874
that he actually fucked me.

830
01:13:34,319 --> 01:13:36,335
What? How do you know?

831
01:13:36,370 --> 01:13:38,352
My friend saw the tester.

832
01:13:42,199 --> 01:13:44,364
Are you dead fucking sure?

833
01:13:44,399 --> 01:13:47,039
Sure that it...
No, no. We're sure.

834
01:13:47,074 --> 01:13:49,644
Fuck, I mean,
no-one knows what to do.

835
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:51,719
Sarah's scared shitless.
She thinks he's cheating on her.

836
01:13:51,754 --> 01:13:55,524
Well... where are you going?

837
01:13:55,559 --> 01:13:57,436
Marcus, look, you didn't
hear it from me, alright?

838
01:13:58,519 --> 01:13:59,964
Marcus.

839
01:13:59,999 --> 01:14:02,159
Where are you going?
Come on, don't. Marcus!

840
01:14:02,194 --> 01:14:03,672
MARCUS: Just leave me alone!
Marcus!

841
01:14:11,279 --> 01:14:13,239
MAN ON LOUDSPEAKER:
Could Simona Carboni please come to

842
01:14:13,274 --> 01:14:14,724
the science lab, thanks?

843
01:14:14,759 --> 01:14:17,114
Simona Carboni to the science lab.
Thank you.

844
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:47,832
Fuck.

845
01:14:52,159 --> 01:14:54,719
You fucking whore.
What the fuck have you said?

846
01:14:54,754 --> 01:14:56,199
What the fuck did you do?!

847
01:15:00,119 --> 01:15:01,916
Is it true?!

848
01:15:07,959 --> 01:15:09,415
Fuck!

849
01:15:09,450 --> 01:15:10,872
Fuck!

850
01:15:38,239 --> 01:15:42,517
Um... I'm not too sure what
I wanna do when I leave here.

851
01:15:44,119 --> 01:15:46,719
I know I should have all that
planned out by now,

852
01:15:46,754 --> 01:15:48,630
have my goals set.

853
01:15:50,759 --> 01:15:53,637
I know Marcus wants to be
some hot shot lawyer.

854
01:15:55,279 --> 01:15:56,712
Good on him.

855
01:15:58,159 --> 01:16:02,869
But me? I cannot imagine sitting
behind a desk all day long.

856
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:07,192
I wanna travel.

857
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:11,157
Get as far away as possible.

858
01:16:30,359 --> 01:16:32,244
SARAH: Hey, I've been looking for you.

859
01:16:32,279 --> 01:16:34,839
Baby, what's wrong?
LUKE: Just fuck off, alright?

860
01:16:36,639 --> 01:16:38,072
LUKE: Fuck!

861
01:17:50,439 --> 01:17:52,794
Oi. Steven, are you OK?
You're bleeding.

862
01:17:53,839 --> 01:17:55,397
I have a tissue if you want.

863
01:18:14,039 --> 01:18:16,855
Hey, are you gonna be OK?

864
01:18:16,890 --> 01:18:19,672
STEVEN: Yeah. I'll be OK.

865
01:18:23,679 --> 01:18:25,519
MAN ON LOUDSPEAKER:
Could Simona Carboni please come to

866
01:18:25,554 --> 01:18:27,084
the science lab, thanks?

867
01:18:27,119 --> 01:18:29,792
Simona Carboni to the science lab.
Thank you.

868
01:19:32,599 --> 01:19:34,078
MARCUS: Is it true?!

869
01:21:41,319 --> 01:21:44,072
Marcus. Come on, I didn't...

870
01:22:33,319 --> 01:22:36,277
Hey, are you gonna be OK?

871
01:25:37,159 --> 01:25:40,604
Sometimes, you know...

872
01:25:40,639 --> 01:25:44,109
Sometimes you just get so wrapped up
in your own problems that...

873
01:25:46,599 --> 01:25:48,079
...you just don't notice anybody else.

874
01:25:48,114 --> 01:25:49,876
You know?

875
01:25:52,399 --> 01:25:56,324
You know, people talk
about reincarnation and heaven

876
01:25:56,359 --> 01:25:59,199
and what happens when you die
and hell and all that bullshit.

877
01:25:59,234 --> 01:26:01,439
I mean, it just...
none of it makes sense, you know?

878
01:26:01,474 --> 01:26:03,559
It's just... people
are scared of dying.

879
01:26:03,594 --> 01:26:05,044
Well, I'm not.

880
01:26:05,079 --> 01:26:07,513
Once you're dead, you're dead.
It's as simple as that.

881
01:26:08,719 --> 01:26:12,679
I think the last time I had
a real conversation with her

882
01:26:12,714 --> 01:26:16,558
was... Year 2 or something.

883
01:26:18,239 --> 01:26:20,116
That was 10 years ago.

884
01:26:21,279 --> 01:26:22,884
Yeah, um...

885
01:26:22,919 --> 01:26:25,752
Well, she was my friend, and...

886
01:26:26,919 --> 01:26:28,352
...I'm gonna miss her.

887
01:26:31,519 --> 01:26:33,839
Don't really have
anything more to say

888
01:26:33,874 --> 01:26:35,272
about it than that.

889
01:26:36,559 --> 01:26:38,550
She was in my brother's music class.

890
01:26:41,959 --> 01:26:44,871
I guess... all I can really say is...

891
01:26:48,079 --> 01:26:49,512
...she's lucky.

892
01:26:52,039 --> 01:26:53,524
Really...

893
01:26:53,559 --> 01:26:54,992
...really lucky.

894
01:26:56,399 --> 01:26:59,124
I mean, I... I knew her.

895
01:26:59,159 --> 01:27:02,199
And she seemed like
a happy enough person.

896
01:27:02,234 --> 01:27:03,924
You know, not once,

897
01:27:03,959 --> 01:27:07,124
not fucking once
did she ask for help

898
01:27:07,159 --> 01:27:10,759
or indicate in any way
that she was going to top herself.

899
01:27:10,794 --> 01:27:13,432
You know, maybe if she did
then I could've helped.

900
01:27:17,599 --> 01:27:19,044
I don't know.

901
01:27:19,079 --> 01:27:22,037
She just... she never...

902
01:27:24,719 --> 01:27:26,152
I don't know.

903
01:27:27,479 --> 01:27:30,319
My, um, sister has this little boy,

904
01:27:30,354 --> 01:27:33,044
um, baby boy, but -

905
01:27:33,079 --> 01:27:35,444
well, he's not really
a baby anymore, I guess -

906
01:27:35,479 --> 01:27:39,639
but he's just learning to talk
and, um, and do animal noises.

907
01:27:39,674 --> 01:27:42,364
And she sent me a video

908
01:27:42,399 --> 01:27:44,564
that she'd taken on her camera
the other day,

909
01:27:44,599 --> 01:27:50,559
and, um, she's got him with his face
painted like a little tiger

910
01:27:50,594 --> 01:27:56,879
and she's saying,
"Oscar, do the tiger noise."

911
01:27:56,914 --> 01:28:00,284
And, um... and his...

912
01:28:00,319 --> 01:28:04,164
...his little face goes, "Miaow!"

913
01:28:04,199 --> 01:28:07,159
With his little lips, and, um...

914
01:28:07,194 --> 01:28:09,164
Yeah, and it's so cute.

915
01:28:09,199 --> 01:28:12,039
The whole camera's shaking
'cause she's laughing so much.

916
01:28:12,074 --> 01:28:13,518
Um... it's just so sweet.

917
01:28:36,639 --> 01:28:38,231
MR DARC Y: Mate, is that you in there?

918
01:28:40,039 --> 01:28:42,079
Shit. Shit.

919
01:28:44,239 --> 01:28:45,684
Open the door!

920
01:28:45,719 --> 01:28:47,719
If there's somebody in there,
open the door!

921
01:28:50,319 --> 01:28:52,230
Open the door!

922
01:30:06,999 --> 01:30:14,713
