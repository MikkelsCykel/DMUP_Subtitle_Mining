1
00:02:52,484 --> 00:02:54,782
Typewriters, transcripts, 
anything missing?

2
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,281
The key to the ladies room.

3
00:03:13,638 --> 00:03:15,731
Where was the fecal material found?

4
00:03:16,007 --> 00:03:19,135
In the corner.
You'll know when you're near it.

5
00:03:19,711 --> 00:03:22,441
- This was mailed to me.
- Just a minute.

6
00:03:22,514 --> 00:03:25,813
If you don't have a telephone,
bring in a gas bill.

7
00:03:26,084 --> 00:03:28,416
We need proof that you live 
in the district.

8
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:33,320
I'm Jaime Escalante.
I'm supposed to teach Computer Science.

9
00:03:33,525 --> 00:03:35,015
We don't have computers.

10
00:03:38,063 --> 00:03:42,432
We were supposed to get computers,
but there's no funding for them again.

11
00:03:43,034 --> 00:03:46,003
I'm Raquel Ortega,
chairman of the math department.

12
00:03:46,071 --> 00:03:47,538
We'll be working together.

13
00:03:48,273 --> 00:03:52,334
You don't understand.
I was supposed to teach computers.

14
00:03:57,349 --> 00:03:59,840
- Where were you last night?
- Where was I?

15
00:04:00,118 --> 00:04:02,609
"Where was I?" I was waiting.

16
00:04:03,555 --> 00:04:05,546
You the new teacher?

17
00:04:05,957 --> 00:04:07,618
Please find a seat.

18
00:04:10,195 --> 00:04:11,856
What are we doing today?

19
00:04:12,397 --> 00:04:14,763
Will everyone please try to find a seat?

20
00:04:19,971 --> 00:04:21,632
If you can't find a seat...

21
00:04:21,807 --> 00:04:23,297
...stand against the wall.

22
00:04:23,575 --> 00:04:26,567
Let's put our desks in a circle
and discuss our feelings.

23
00:04:27,379 --> 00:04:28,869
One body to a desk.

24
00:04:33,852 --> 00:04:35,410
Could we talk about sex?

25
00:04:37,389 --> 00:04:39,584
Then I'd have to give sex for homework.

26
00:04:42,394 --> 00:04:44,658
Stand back everybody, please.

27
00:04:44,896 --> 00:04:47,729
I can get you fired for saying that.

28
00:04:48,233 --> 00:04:49,598
What'd he say?

29
00:04:50,502 --> 00:04:51,833
¿Entienden inglés?

30
00:04:52,337 --> 00:04:53,497
Sometimes.

31
00:05:00,512 --> 00:05:03,379
Please move forward
if you do not speak English.

32
00:05:05,684 --> 00:05:08,517
All the first row, stand up. Move out.

33
00:05:08,753 --> 00:05:10,311
I was the first one here.

34
00:05:10,522 --> 00:05:12,615
I'll find you another seat, okay?

35
00:05:17,629 --> 00:05:19,028
Be careful.

36
00:05:19,431 --> 00:05:21,092
This is Math 1-A.

37
00:05:21,366 --> 00:05:25,359
I don't need math. I got a solar calculator
with my dozen doughnuts.

38
00:05:25,637 --> 00:05:28,265
The bus is exact change. No big deal.

39
00:05:29,407 --> 00:05:30,567
Quiet!

40
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,674
Everyone back in the classroom!

41
00:06:13,818 --> 00:06:15,979
Everyone back in the class!

42
00:06:17,689 --> 00:06:21,181
It was a premature bell. Back in the class.

43
00:06:21,693 --> 00:06:23,251
That was a premature bell.

44
00:06:23,495 --> 00:06:26,430
Premature bell?
We're not supposed to discuss sex in class.

45
00:06:26,765 --> 00:06:29,427
Sit down! Stop talking!

46
00:06:39,644 --> 00:06:41,202
They rigged the bell.

47
00:06:41,713 --> 00:06:43,340
Those little bastards.

48
00:07:24,289 --> 00:07:25,779
She's looking good, Joe.

49
00:07:26,057 --> 00:07:28,048
When are you coming aboard?

50
00:07:28,593 --> 00:07:30,458
I get seasick in the rain.

51
00:07:31,629 --> 00:07:34,928
- Have you seen my boy?
- He was riding around here somewhere.

52
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,992
I hear your company's pushing
whole hog into PCs.

53
00:07:38,269 --> 00:07:39,998
I don't work there anymore.

54
00:07:40,105 --> 00:07:43,597
Jaime's teaching high school now.
Here's your thingy.

55
00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:46,775
If you got laid off,
why didn't you come to me?

56
00:07:46,845 --> 00:07:49,336
We pay kids right out of college $30,000.

57
00:07:49,681 --> 00:07:52,912
I didn't get laid off. I want to teach.

58
00:07:53,752 --> 00:07:55,242
High school teacher.

59
00:07:55,854 --> 00:07:57,754
Well, good. That's great.

60
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,619
This is your job.

61
00:08:01,926 --> 00:08:04,588
I was going to do it.
Why do you think I hurried home?

62
00:08:06,865 --> 00:08:10,164
You're not even breathing hard,
you're hurrying so fast.

63
00:08:10,435 --> 00:08:11,925
Have a good night, Joe.

64
00:08:16,107 --> 00:08:20,066
I want a burger, hold the French fries,
the onions, and the pickles!

65
00:08:20,612 --> 00:08:22,443
You look like Julia Child.

66
00:08:31,823 --> 00:08:32,790
What you got?

67
00:08:33,591 --> 00:08:34,649
It's an apple.

68
00:08:37,662 --> 00:08:38,788
How much?

69
00:08:40,732 --> 00:08:41,926
What do you mean?

70
00:08:44,402 --> 00:08:45,835
What have you got?

71
00:08:46,638 --> 00:08:47,627
Half.

72
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:49,028
Good.

73
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,570
Excuse my German accent.

74
00:08:54,712 --> 00:08:55,872
What have you got?

75
00:08:56,514 --> 00:08:58,448
Missing 25 percent.

76
00:09:07,725 --> 00:09:10,193
- What?
- It's missing 25 percent.

77
00:09:16,167 --> 00:09:18,761
That's right. Missing 25 percent.

78
00:09:19,404 --> 00:09:21,929
Is it true intelligent people
make better lovers?

79
00:09:26,311 --> 00:09:27,642
What you got?

80
00:09:29,447 --> 00:09:30,778
I got a core.

81
00:09:31,716 --> 00:09:33,240
You owe me 100 percent.

82
00:09:35,019 --> 00:09:36,850
I'll see you in The People's Court.

83
00:09:39,824 --> 00:09:43,590
Everyone please open your books,
Chapter 2, Page 26.

84
00:09:44,229 --> 00:09:46,288
Multiplication of fractions...

85
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:49,130
...and percentages.

86
00:09:51,102 --> 00:09:52,330
25 percent...

87
00:09:52,871 --> 00:09:53,963
...50 percent...

88
00:09:54,305 --> 00:09:55,602
...75 percent...

89
00:09:59,144 --> 00:10:00,372
...and 100 percent.

90
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,075
Who's calling the shots, ese?

91
00:10:06,384 --> 00:10:07,874
Have you got a slip?

92
00:10:10,722 --> 00:10:12,087
You got a slip?

93
00:10:24,836 --> 00:10:28,431
You'll have to stand in the back
until I can get another desk.

94
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,267
You sit right here.

95
00:10:32,777 --> 00:10:37,146
Everyone please read
the first paragraph for a second.

96
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,182
- Where's your equipment?
- Don't got any.

97
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:49,256
Got to come to this class prepared.

98
00:10:51,095 --> 00:10:52,926
Do the work in my head.

99
00:10:58,002 --> 00:10:59,663
You know the times tables?

100
00:11:00,538 --> 00:11:01,903
I know the one's...

101
00:11:03,107 --> 00:11:04,301
...two's...

102
00:11:04,909 --> 00:11:06,103
...three's.

103
00:11:07,345 --> 00:11:09,939
Finger Man. I heard about you.

104
00:11:12,217 --> 00:11:13,548
Are you the Finger Man?

105
00:11:13,618 --> 00:11:15,449
I'm the Finger Man, too.

106
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,483
Do you know what I can do?

107
00:11:18,456 --> 00:11:20,253
I know how to multiply by nine.

108
00:11:20,725 --> 00:11:23,250
9 x 3. One, two, three. What do you get?

109
00:11:24,462 --> 00:11:25,759
27!

110
00:11:26,931 --> 00:11:29,866
6 x 9. One, two, three, four, five, six.

111
00:11:30,401 --> 00:11:32,892
What do you get? 54!

112
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,268
Do you want a hard one?
How about 8 x 9?

113
00:11:41,212 --> 00:11:43,146
What have you got? 72.

114
00:11:45,316 --> 00:11:46,510
Wait a minute.

115
00:11:46,884 --> 00:11:51,150
Please make sure you do problems
1 through 20. Page 26.

116
00:11:51,322 --> 00:11:53,517
Can I have my book, Mr. Escalante?

117
00:11:53,992 --> 00:11:55,892
Don't bring it to class again.

118
00:12:01,299 --> 00:12:02,766
Don't get excited.

119
00:12:04,102 --> 00:12:06,935
Cut me a D like the other profes.

120
00:12:08,439 --> 00:12:09,997
I'll read my funny books...

121
00:12:10,275 --> 00:12:12,607
...count the holes in the ceiling...

122
00:12:12,944 --> 00:12:14,434
...kick back.

123
00:12:15,179 --> 00:12:17,340
First thing, I can teach you some manners.

124
00:12:23,621 --> 00:12:25,612
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

125
00:12:25,957 --> 00:12:28,050
Lose a finger, I can't count to ten.

126
00:12:33,464 --> 00:12:35,557
We've seen vatos like you before.

127
00:12:36,167 --> 00:12:37,794
You'll be hurting soon.

128
00:12:39,771 --> 00:12:41,136
Ponte trucha.

129
00:12:49,147 --> 00:12:53,447
I was so worried the kids would know
more than me, I'd wake at 5:00 a. M...

130
00:12:53,584 --> 00:12:55,882
...down my coffee and hit the math text.

131
00:12:56,154 --> 00:12:58,213
I finally get every chapter down...

132
00:12:58,489 --> 00:13:00,480
...and now they change the book on me.

133
00:13:00,725 --> 00:13:04,388
Math, you either love or hate.
You got problems, come see me.

134
00:13:04,729 --> 00:13:06,890
Thanks, Jaime. See you later.

135
00:13:16,507 --> 00:13:19,670
You're in love? Which one? Let me know.

136
00:13:20,011 --> 00:13:21,501
No, that's all right.

137
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:25,672
- Come on, Johnny, don't be afraid.
- I'm not "Johnny."

138
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,741
I know, Tito. Tito Grande.

139
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,768
Angel!

140
00:14:10,828 --> 00:14:11,988
Go get a teacher!

141
00:14:13,064 --> 00:14:14,827
It's Frank Garcia.

142
00:14:15,466 --> 00:14:17,832
When I say García, you answer, okay?

143
00:14:19,871 --> 00:14:21,168
Are your friends auditing?

144
00:14:21,239 --> 00:14:23,469
I audited them to come with me.

145
00:14:31,649 --> 00:14:34,311
I'm El Ciclón from Bolivia.

146
00:14:35,019 --> 00:14:36,384
One-man gang.

147
00:14:37,488 --> 00:14:39,683
This is my domain.

148
00:14:41,492 --> 00:14:42,789
Don't give me no gas.

149
00:14:43,361 --> 00:14:46,853
I'll jump on your face,
tattoo your chromosomes.

150
00:14:47,165 --> 00:14:50,794
This is basic math,
but basic math is too easy for you.

151
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:53,863
So I'll teach you algebra,
because I'm the champ.

152
00:14:54,372 --> 00:14:56,863
If the only thing you can do is
add and subtract...

153
00:14:56,941 --> 00:14:59,637
...you'll be able to do one thing: Pump gas.

154
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:03,146
Ripping off a gas station is better
than working in one.

155
00:15:06,951 --> 00:15:08,441
I'm a tough guy.

156
00:15:08,719 --> 00:15:12,382
Tough guys don't do math,
tough guys deep fry chicken for a living.

157
00:15:12,824 --> 00:15:14,815
You want a wing or a leg?

158
00:15:17,328 --> 00:15:19,819
Who ever heard of negative
and positive numbers?

159
00:15:20,631 --> 00:15:22,724
Negative numbers are like unemployment.

160
00:15:23,301 --> 00:15:26,202
Ten million people out of work,
that's a negative number.

161
00:15:26,304 --> 00:15:29,535
We'll need lots of Kleenex 'cause
there's gonna be bloodshed.

162
00:15:29,807 --> 00:15:31,798
Have you ever been to the beach?

163
00:15:34,245 --> 00:15:36,475
Have you ever played with the sand?

164
00:15:38,049 --> 00:15:38,981
Finger Man!

165
00:15:42,487 --> 00:15:44,011
You ever dig a hole?

166
00:15:45,389 --> 00:15:48,085
The sand that comes out of the hole,
that's a positive.

167
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:49,990
The hole is a negative.

168
00:15:52,763 --> 00:15:55,493
That's it. Simple. Anybody can do it.

169
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:58,961
- 2 + 2 =...

170
00:16:00,171 --> 00:16:01,069
Net Head?

171
00:16:04,475 --> 00:16:05,567
Answer it.

172
00:16:06,777 --> 00:16:08,711
Come on, you know the answer.

173
00:16:10,081 --> 00:16:12,447
- 2 + 2. Fill the hole.

174
00:16:14,018 --> 00:16:16,680
If I had that on my hand,
I wouldn't raise it, either.

175
00:16:18,623 --> 00:16:20,989
- 2 + 2 =...

176
00:16:21,259 --> 00:16:23,693
Anybody can do it. Fill the hole.

177
00:16:23,794 --> 00:16:25,591
- 2 + 2 =...

178
00:16:27,765 --> 00:16:29,756
Just fill the hole.

179
00:16:30,034 --> 00:16:31,695
You can do it.

180
00:16:32,136 --> 00:16:34,570
Don't let these burros laugh at you.

181
00:16:35,306 --> 00:16:37,274
- 2 + 2 =...

182
00:16:38,576 --> 00:16:40,567
I'll break your neck like a toothpick.

183
00:16:45,349 --> 00:16:46,475
0.

184
00:16:48,052 --> 00:16:49,212
0? You're right.

185
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,947
Simple. That's it.

186
00:16:51,322 --> 00:16:54,450
- 2 + 2 = 0. He just filled the hole.

187
00:16:55,226 --> 00:16:59,890
Neither the Greeks nor the Romans were
capable of using the concept of zero.

188
00:17:00,431 --> 00:17:01,830
It was your ancestors...

189
00:17:01,899 --> 00:17:06,393
...the Mayas, who first contemplated
the zero. The absence of value.

190
00:17:06,771 --> 00:17:07,931
True story.

191
00:17:08,172 --> 00:17:10,402
You burros have math in your blood.

192
00:17:10,775 --> 00:17:14,006
Kimo sabe todo.
The man knows everything!

193
00:17:17,148 --> 00:17:21,744
Parenthesis means multiply.
Every time you see this, multiply.

194
00:17:21,852 --> 00:17:25,253
A negative times a negative
equals a positive.

195
00:17:25,623 --> 00:17:28,421
"A negative times a negative
equals a positive." Say it.

196
00:17:28,492 --> 00:17:31,484
"A negative times a negative
equals a positive." Say it!

197
00:17:31,562 --> 00:17:34,395
"A negative times a negative
equals a positive."

198
00:17:34,665 --> 00:17:35,495
Again!

199
00:17:35,566 --> 00:17:38,057
"A negative times a negative
equals a positive."

200
00:17:38,202 --> 00:17:41,194
"A negative times a negative
equals a positive."

201
00:17:41,772 --> 00:17:42,830
I can't hear you.

202
00:17:42,907 --> 00:17:45,501
"A negative times a negative
equals a positive."

203
00:17:45,576 --> 00:17:46,270
Louder!

204
00:17:46,344 --> 00:17:48,972
"A negative times a negative
equals a positive!"

205
00:17:49,213 --> 00:17:50,202
Louder!

206
00:17:50,281 --> 00:17:53,045
"A negative times a negative
equals a positive!"

207
00:17:53,618 --> 00:17:55,017
Why?

208
00:17:57,655 --> 00:18:00,749
My point is I don't want
to be the principal...

209
00:18:00,992 --> 00:18:05,326
...of the first school in the history
of Los Angeles to lose its accreditation.

210
00:18:05,696 --> 00:18:09,530
I'm the last person to say that
this math department couldn't improve.

211
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:12,134
But if you want higher test scores...

212
00:18:12,203 --> 00:18:15,400
...start by changing the economic level
of this community.

213
00:18:15,806 --> 00:18:20,470
The purpose of this meeting is to review
the recommendations for accreditation.

214
00:18:21,379 --> 00:18:22,710
Any suggestions?

215
00:18:25,349 --> 00:18:28,182
I don't think
I should be teaching math next semester.

216
00:18:28,586 --> 00:18:31,214
I was hired to be phys. Ed. Instructor.

217
00:18:31,656 --> 00:18:33,317
As I said before...

218
00:18:33,891 --> 00:18:38,590
...we lack the resources to implement
the changes the district demands.

219
00:18:39,897 --> 00:18:43,731
Mr. Sanzaki,
you must have at least one comment.

220
00:18:44,402 --> 00:18:47,235
This may not be the right time
to say this, but...

221
00:18:48,105 --> 00:18:50,903
...I'm sorry, but I won't be coming back
after Christmas.

222
00:18:51,008 --> 00:18:53,101
I got a job with aerospace.

223
00:18:55,513 --> 00:18:56,673
How much money?

224
00:18:57,114 --> 00:19:01,414
We have the remainder of the year
before we're put on probation.

225
00:19:02,019 --> 00:19:05,511
- If we fail, we lose accreditation.
- If we fail?

226
00:19:05,856 --> 00:19:08,848
You can't teach logarithms to illiterates.

227
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,893
These kids come to us
with barely a 7th grade education.

228
00:19:13,197 --> 00:19:17,031
There isn't a teacher in this room
who isn't doing everything he possibly can.

229
00:19:17,535 --> 00:19:19,628
I'm not. I could teach more.

230
00:19:21,772 --> 00:19:24,935
I'm sure Mr. Escalante
has good intentions...

231
00:19:25,276 --> 00:19:27,938
...but he's only been here a few months.

232
00:19:29,647 --> 00:19:33,640
Students will rise to the level
of expectations, Señor Molina.

233
00:19:36,654 --> 00:19:38,554
What do you need, Mr. Escalante?

234
00:19:39,457 --> 00:19:41,948
Ganas. All we need is ganas.

235
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:43,048
What's ganas?

236
00:19:47,031 --> 00:19:50,023
We will begin each class with a quiz.

237
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:57,204
There will be no free rides, no excuses.

238
00:19:57,541 --> 00:20:00,374
You already have two strikes against you.

239
00:20:00,711 --> 00:20:03,043
There are some people in this world...

240
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:06,543
...who assume that you know less
than you do...

241
00:20:06,884 --> 00:20:10,718
...because of your name
and your complexion...

242
00:20:11,055 --> 00:20:14,047
...but math is the great equalizer.

243
00:20:15,726 --> 00:20:18,388
When you go for a job, the employer...

244
00:20:18,729 --> 00:20:21,630
...will not want to hear your problems.
Neither do I.

245
00:20:21,899 --> 00:20:24,891
You'll work harder
than you ever worked before.

246
00:20:25,736 --> 00:20:28,728
And the only thing I ask
from you is ganas...

247
00:20:29,073 --> 00:20:31,405
...desire... a haircut.

248
00:20:32,143 --> 00:20:35,738
If you don't have the ganas,
I will give it to you because I am an expert.

249
00:20:35,813 --> 00:20:38,077
Today is Monday,
tomorrow is Wednesday...

250
00:20:38,249 --> 00:20:41,013
...Friday is payday, the weekly test.

251
00:20:41,118 --> 00:20:42,676
There will be no diagonal vision.

252
00:20:42,753 --> 00:20:45,813
Keep your eyes on your own paper.
You have 10 minutes to finish.

253
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:50,623
If you finish early, start the assignment
on the board. No questions? Good.

254
00:20:53,697 --> 00:20:56,188
¡Angel, vámonos!

255
00:21:06,844 --> 00:21:08,835
I was said to go here.

256
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:16,443
Nice knowing you.

257
00:21:17,521 --> 00:21:19,682
Have a good day. Arrivederci!

258
00:21:20,124 --> 00:21:22,957
You're in luck. Take the seat.

259
00:21:23,661 --> 00:21:27,153
Relax, take Sominex.
Don't sleep in my class.

260
00:21:28,432 --> 00:21:30,366
I take that as an insult.

261
00:21:54,325 --> 00:21:57,988
Kimo, I want to talk to you about the class.

262
00:21:58,562 --> 00:22:00,587
You ain't got a seat. Don't give me no gas.

263
00:22:00,664 --> 00:22:02,962
I know about that. It was a mistake.

264
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,432
I'm gonna fly straight, but I got a problem.

265
00:22:05,502 --> 00:22:06,662
Yeah, me.

266
00:22:07,004 --> 00:22:08,494
Seriously. Books.

267
00:22:08,572 --> 00:22:10,836
The homies can't see me
haul them around.

268
00:22:11,175 --> 00:22:13,769
You don't want anyone to think
you're intelligent.

269
00:22:13,844 --> 00:22:17,177
Maybe I can have two books,
keep one stashed at home.

270
00:22:18,849 --> 00:22:22,683
I'll cut you a deal.
I'll give you three books.

271
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:25,511
Take one home. One for your class.

272
00:22:25,756 --> 00:22:27,348
This one is broken.

273
00:22:32,863 --> 00:22:36,458
One for your locker,
so nobody sees you carrying it around.

274
00:22:36,533 --> 00:22:37,795
Easily understood?

275
00:22:37,868 --> 00:22:39,130
What do I get?

276
00:22:40,204 --> 00:22:41,865
Protection, Kimo.

277
00:22:42,206 --> 00:22:44,367
Protección, understand?

278
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,441
I understand.

279
00:22:49,213 --> 00:22:50,874
I understand.

280
00:22:53,384 --> 00:22:56,547
That's the only reason
I'm still in Kimo's class.

281
00:22:56,654 --> 00:22:59,418
Don't tell her that you dig her.

282
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:02,220
That's the worst thing you can do
with a woman.

283
00:23:09,066 --> 00:23:12,229
I'm fed up with this pelón we got
for a teacher.

284
00:23:12,903 --> 00:23:15,064
Escalante has a bug up his ass.

285
00:23:15,306 --> 00:23:19,470
He's from South America.
He's probably a Nazi come out of hiding.

286
00:23:19,576 --> 00:23:23,068
Don't you know?
Garfield can't get accredited.

287
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,643
Only teachers who act like assholes
will keep their jobs.

288
00:23:26,917 --> 00:23:29,750
What if we all decide not to take this test?

289
00:23:30,254 --> 00:23:32,085
He can't fail the whole class.

290
00:23:32,423 --> 00:23:34,254
Mutiny. That's cool.

291
00:23:40,264 --> 00:23:41,925
See you guys later.

292
00:23:49,273 --> 00:23:52,606
Camejo thinks she's hot
because she dates gabachos.

293
00:23:56,613 --> 00:23:59,275
If we don't do better today, heads will roll.

294
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:02,683
I've never gotten lower
than a B+ in my life.

295
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,953
Because you take those
Mickey Mouse classes.

296
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:10,253
Always get an A.
Here you have a chance for a solid D.

297
00:24:14,965 --> 00:24:16,626
You got 10 minutes.

298
00:24:20,471 --> 00:24:21,961
Here he comes.

299
00:24:23,374 --> 00:24:24,966
Watch this.

300
00:24:28,145 --> 00:24:29,203
What's wrong with you?

301
00:24:29,813 --> 00:24:31,474
I'm not taking the quiz.

302
00:24:32,649 --> 00:24:34,708
You didn't turn in your homework.

303
00:24:35,152 --> 00:24:36,483
My goat ate it.

304
00:24:41,658 --> 00:24:45,150
You don't do your homework,
you don't get a ticket to watch the show.

305
00:24:46,997 --> 00:24:48,396
Give her the chair!

306
00:24:50,801 --> 00:24:51,790
Shit.

307
00:24:59,343 --> 00:25:01,174
Chair! Chair! Chair!

308
00:25:10,854 --> 00:25:12,082
Shut up!

309
00:25:16,026 --> 00:25:19,018
Get back to your tests.
You've got less than nine minutes.

310
00:25:24,101 --> 00:25:25,762
Now you're the show.

311
00:25:27,704 --> 00:25:31,868
What's the matter with you?
Are you the dumb student? Come on!

312
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:48,221
3:00.

313
00:25:48,792 --> 00:25:50,783
You'll have to do it anyway.

314
00:27:49,012 --> 00:27:50,343
Kids go to bed?

315
00:27:52,916 --> 00:27:54,406
Papa go to work?

316
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,351
Can I fix you something to eat?

317
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,352
Mija, could you please turn off that light?

318
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,721
Orale, homeboy.

319
00:28:39,563 --> 00:28:40,894
Teacher time, ese.

320
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:49,061
Tell Kimo I say, "¿Qué hubo?", ese.

321
00:28:49,406 --> 00:28:51,067
Oh, shit man!

322
00:28:59,082 --> 00:29:01,414
Green light, red light?

323
00:29:01,752 --> 00:29:03,083
Anybody?

324
00:29:05,422 --> 00:29:08,084
Late! Late, Angel!

325
00:29:12,829 --> 00:29:14,820
- Go see the counselor.
- Come on, Kimo.

326
00:29:15,265 --> 00:29:19,429
Go to wood shop, make a shoeshine box.
You'll need it.

327
00:29:21,938 --> 00:29:23,929
You're the man, you know.

328
00:29:26,109 --> 00:29:30,944
Why don't you put them in college, huh?
So dumb taco benders like me...

329
00:29:31,615 --> 00:29:33,606
...can pick their vegetables...

330
00:29:34,117 --> 00:29:35,948
...collect their garbage...

331
00:29:36,453 --> 00:29:38,614
...clip their poodle's toenails.

332
00:29:48,131 --> 00:29:49,792
I may be a sinner...

333
00:29:50,867 --> 00:29:53,199
...but I'm willing to pay for my sins.

334
00:29:55,806 --> 00:29:59,139
One-shot deal. Go sit down.
See you at 3:00.

335
00:30:02,813 --> 00:30:04,144
Go to hell.

336
00:30:07,818 --> 00:30:09,979
I got more bad news for you.

337
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,483
What I'm going to say will trip you out.

338
00:30:15,325 --> 00:30:17,657
Mr. Escalante, I forgot my pencil.

339
00:30:19,496 --> 00:30:21,157
He can have mine.

340
00:30:22,833 --> 00:30:24,664
Today is my last day.

341
00:30:36,847 --> 00:30:38,678
Did you enjoy your taquitos?

342
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,511
Except for one thing.

343
00:30:46,423 --> 00:30:48,186
Someone doesn't know how to add.

344
00:30:50,193 --> 00:30:51,854
She should be back in school.

345
00:31:02,372 --> 00:31:05,864
Papa, this is Mr. Escalante,
my math teacher.

346
00:31:15,118 --> 00:31:16,779
Can you sit with us?

347
00:31:18,321 --> 00:31:20,983
Anita, bring us a couple of beers.

348
00:31:25,729 --> 00:31:28,061
You should get another waitress.

349
00:31:30,734 --> 00:31:35,068
Ana can be the first in your family
to graduate and go to college.

350
00:31:36,006 --> 00:31:37,997
I thank you for your concern.

351
00:31:38,909 --> 00:31:41,571
Her mother, sisters,
and brothers work here.

352
00:31:42,078 --> 00:31:45,570
This is a family business. She is needed.

353
00:31:46,917 --> 00:31:49,909
She could help the family more
by getting an education.

354
00:31:51,421 --> 00:31:55,414
She'd probably get pregnant.
She wouldn't finish college.

355
00:31:56,426 --> 00:31:59,259
Anita, go help your mom in the kitchen.

356
00:32:01,932 --> 00:32:04,423
She talks about going to medical school.

357
00:32:06,503 --> 00:32:07,663
I don't think so.

358
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,904
She should make her own choices.

359
00:32:18,114 --> 00:32:19,775
She'll just get fat.

360
00:32:20,116 --> 00:32:23,608
She'll waste her life here. She's a top kid!

361
00:32:24,788 --> 00:32:28,280
I started washing dishes
for a nickel an hour.

362
00:32:28,625 --> 00:32:30,616
Now I own this place.

363
00:32:32,028 --> 00:32:33,518
Did I waste my life?

364
00:32:33,864 --> 00:32:36,856
I washed dishes too
when I came to America.

365
00:32:37,033 --> 00:32:38,022
Good!

366
00:32:38,468 --> 00:32:41,130
Put on an apron and give us a hand.

367
00:32:42,172 --> 00:32:45,107
Your husband comes
to my restaurant, eats...

368
00:32:45,542 --> 00:32:47,134
...then insults me.

369
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:49,540
Excuse my husband, Mr. Delgado.

370
00:32:50,814 --> 00:32:53,044
He just wants what's best for Ana.

371
00:32:55,886 --> 00:32:59,481
She could go to college,
then teach you how to run the place.

372
00:33:00,156 --> 00:33:01,316
Professor?

373
00:33:02,959 --> 00:33:06,122
I don't want your money
and I don't need your business.

374
00:33:08,498 --> 00:33:10,329
Skip it. Tip.

375
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:17,037
He puts hot chili in his dip
to sell extra beer.

376
00:33:33,023 --> 00:33:34,422
Dog, dog, dog, dog!

377
00:33:38,361 --> 00:33:40,693
Everybody look at the board.

378
00:33:41,197 --> 00:33:45,691
Will someone please read for me
what's on the board? Anybody.

379
00:33:46,036 --> 00:33:49,699
Juan has five times as many girlfriends
as Pedro.

380
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:53,109
Carlos has one girlfriend less than Pedro.

381
00:33:53,543 --> 00:33:56,876
If their total number of girlfriends is 20...

382
00:33:56,947 --> 00:33:59,609
...how many does each gigolo have?

383
00:34:01,051 --> 00:34:03,042
Late! Late!

384
00:34:03,186 --> 00:34:05,347
Late! Late!

385
00:34:11,394 --> 00:34:14,557
How many girlfriends does
each gigolo have? Anybody.

386
00:34:15,231 --> 00:34:17,893
You think you got it, Einstein?

387
00:34:18,134 --> 00:34:22,628
Juan is x. Carlos is y. Pedro is x + y.

388
00:34:23,073 --> 00:34:25,234
Is Pedro bisexual, or what?

389
00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:29,242
I have a terrible feeling about you.

390
00:34:32,015 --> 00:34:34,313
5x = Juan's girlfriends.

391
00:34:34,985 --> 00:34:36,247
You're good now...

392
00:34:36,319 --> 00:34:40,483
...but you'll end up barefoot,
pregnant and in the kitchen.

393
00:34:41,324 --> 00:34:43,315
Can you get negative girlfriends?

394
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,221
No, just negative boyfriends.

395
00:34:45,428 --> 00:34:48,920
Please forgive them,
for they know not what they do!

396
00:34:49,933 --> 00:34:52,766
Carlos has x - 5 girlfriends, ¿qué no?

397
00:34:53,103 --> 00:34:54,934
"Que no" is right. Que no.

398
00:34:55,972 --> 00:34:57,963
The answer to my prayers!

399
00:34:58,174 --> 00:34:59,607
May I go to the restroom?

400
00:35:00,944 --> 00:35:03,276
In 10 minutes. Hold it.

401
00:35:06,282 --> 00:35:07,442
Hit it.

402
00:35:07,784 --> 00:35:09,775
It's a trick problem, Mr. Kimo.

403
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:13,419
You need to know how many girlfriends
they have in common.

404
00:35:15,125 --> 00:35:17,116
It's not that they're stupid.

405
00:35:17,927 --> 00:35:19,519
They just don't know anything.

406
00:35:19,729 --> 00:35:20,718
I'm wrong?

407
00:35:21,297 --> 00:35:23,788
X = Pedro's girlfriends.

408
00:35:24,134 --> 00:35:26,466
5x = Juan's girlfriends.

409
00:35:26,803 --> 00:35:29,772
X - 1 = Carlos's girlfriends.

410
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:33,570
(x + 5x) + (x -1) = 20.

411
00:35:33,877 --> 00:35:35,344
So, x = 3.

412
00:35:42,485 --> 00:35:44,146
Good to see you.

413
00:35:44,754 --> 00:35:47,917
This makes no sense unless we see
how it works in the real world.

414
00:35:48,491 --> 00:35:53,155
Could I get a couple of gigolos
for a practical demonstration?

415
00:35:53,396 --> 00:35:55,728
No, no. Just kidding.

416
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:36,201
What kind of math is this?

417
00:36:36,706 --> 00:36:39,368
The one that's up right now is calculus.

418
00:36:39,709 --> 00:36:41,540
You'll get it in college.

419
00:36:41,878 --> 00:36:44,711
My daughter uses this program
in her high school.

420
00:36:58,461 --> 00:37:00,691
I want to teach calculus next year.

421
00:37:04,234 --> 00:37:06,225
Boy, that's a jump.

422
00:37:09,906 --> 00:37:14,240
That's ridiculous.
They haven't had trig or math analysis.

423
00:37:14,811 --> 00:37:16,472
They can take them this summer.

424
00:37:16,746 --> 00:37:18,907
Our best students in summer school?

425
00:37:19,149 --> 00:37:20,810
From 7:00 to 12:00.

426
00:37:21,251 --> 00:37:24,584
Every day, including Saturdays.
That would do it.

427
00:37:28,258 --> 00:37:31,921
Summer classrooms are reserved
for remedial courses.

428
00:37:32,929 --> 00:37:35,830
To turn this school around,
start from the top.

429
00:37:36,933 --> 00:37:39,424
Mr. Escalante, don't lecture us.

430
00:37:39,836 --> 00:37:43,499
Our kids can't handle calculus.
We don't even have the books.

431
00:37:44,007 --> 00:37:48,000
If they pass the Advanced Placement Test,
they get college credit.

432
00:37:48,444 --> 00:37:50,435
There are some teachers here...

433
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:53,943
...who couldn't pass
the Advanced Placement Test.

434
00:37:54,851 --> 00:37:57,115
You think you can make this fly?

435
00:38:04,627 --> 00:38:06,618
I teach calculus or...

436
00:38:06,963 --> 00:38:08,521
...have a good day.

437
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:13,463
If this man can walk in here...

438
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:17,870
...and dictate his own terms,
over my objections...

439
00:38:19,209 --> 00:38:22,269
...I see no reason to continue
as department chair.

440
00:38:24,547 --> 00:38:26,708
Don't take this personally.

441
00:38:28,484 --> 00:38:30,816
I'm thinking about those kids.

442
00:38:33,156 --> 00:38:35,989
If they try and don't succeed...

443
00:38:37,327 --> 00:38:40,490
...you'll shatter what little
self-confidence they have.

444
00:38:43,833 --> 00:38:47,166
These aren't the types that bounce back.

445
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:51,500
Have a good day.

446
00:39:19,602 --> 00:39:22,264
Kimo, it stinks like last year in here.

447
00:39:25,375 --> 00:39:27,366
Somebody give Claudia an orange.

448
00:39:28,878 --> 00:39:31,210
Okay, okay! Sit down!

449
00:39:34,717 --> 00:39:38,915
You think I want to do this?
The Japanese pay me.

450
00:39:39,522 --> 00:39:44,084
They're tired of making everything.
They want you to pull your own weight...

451
00:39:44,727 --> 00:39:47,560
...so they can go take vacations
on Mount Fuji.

452
00:39:49,232 --> 00:39:53,225
Kimo, I thought this room
was supposed to be air-conditioned.

453
00:39:54,237 --> 00:39:56,569
You should think cool.

454
00:39:58,574 --> 00:39:59,734
Think...

455
00:39:59,976 --> 00:40:01,307
Cool.

456
00:40:01,911 --> 00:40:02,969
Think...

457
00:40:03,413 --> 00:40:04,744
Cool.

458
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:09,649
Cool!

459
00:40:23,433 --> 00:40:27,597
I get this letter saying
I'm fired because of Proposition 13.

460
00:40:27,837 --> 00:40:29,828
I'm down to $936.

461
00:40:30,273 --> 00:40:33,106
I invest $100 in resumes and buy this suit.

462
00:40:33,509 --> 00:40:36,000
I hit every insurance company in the city.

463
00:40:36,446 --> 00:40:39,210
My wife wants us to move
into her parents' rec room.

464
00:40:39,282 --> 00:40:43,616
Two weeks later I get another letter
telling me to go back to work.

465
00:40:43,853 --> 00:40:45,343
How do you like the suit?

466
00:40:45,521 --> 00:40:47,853
- Fabulous.
- How about the color?

467
00:40:50,059 --> 00:40:51,822
Welcome back, pelón!

468
00:41:36,406 --> 00:41:38,738
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

469
00:41:39,175 --> 00:41:40,164
Sure?

470
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:42,571
Yes! I said I was fine.

471
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:54,083
We will go step by step, inch by inch.

472
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:57,823
Calculus was not made to be easy.
It already is.

473
00:41:57,927 --> 00:42:00,418
Remember the good times we had
last summer?

474
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:04,693
Remember when things were
really jumping good?

475
00:42:05,935 --> 00:42:09,769
That's Gone With tAhe Wind.
Now it's The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.

476
00:42:10,039 --> 00:42:14,442
Come on, a contract?
You mean you can't trust us by now?

477
00:42:16,045 --> 00:42:20,709
Those of you who commit will be preparing
for the AdVanced Placement Test.

478
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:23,541
Have this signed before class tomorrow.

479
00:42:23,786 --> 00:42:28,450
We come in an hour early, take your class
two periods and stay until 5:00?

480
00:42:28,691 --> 00:42:29,885
Believe it or don't.

481
00:42:29,959 --> 00:42:33,451
We have to come on Saturdays?
And no vacations?

482
00:42:33,796 --> 00:42:36,287
Pass the A.P. And you get college credit.

483
00:42:36,566 --> 00:42:40,559
- Big deal.
- We're seniors. We get to slack off.

484
00:42:41,471 --> 00:42:46,306
Can you make it Saturday morning
after playing in your band Friday nights?

485
00:42:47,443 --> 00:42:50,071
I know you love scaring us into doing stuff.

486
00:42:50,746 --> 00:42:53,078
But that gets old real fast.

487
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,851
Hey, Kimo.

488
00:42:58,921 --> 00:43:01,412
You proud of me? I'm the first dude here!

489
00:43:02,492 --> 00:43:04,153
What's calculus?

490
00:43:11,434 --> 00:43:15,336
Calculus is math
that Sir Isaac Newton invented...

491
00:43:15,438 --> 00:43:20,273
...to figure out planet orbits.
But he never told anybody about it...

492
00:43:20,343 --> 00:43:24,507
...until this other scientist
claimed he had invented calculus.

493
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:27,146
But the guy was so stupid
he got it all wrong...

494
00:43:27,216 --> 00:43:31,380
...so Newton went public
to fix his mistakes. Isn't that neat?

495
00:43:31,854 --> 00:43:34,186
For a genius, Newton was an idiot.

496
00:43:34,457 --> 00:43:37,620
If I invent something,
I'll make sure to get paid.

497
00:43:38,027 --> 00:43:41,519
I hope this isn't an excuse
to stay out all hours.

498
00:43:42,031 --> 00:43:44,295
Trust me, Mom. Sign it.

499
00:43:44,634 --> 00:43:46,864
Boys don't like it if you're smart.

500
00:43:47,203 --> 00:43:51,867
I'm doing this so I don't have to depend
on some dumb guy for the rest of my life.

501
00:44:02,485 --> 00:44:03,645
Thank you.

502
00:44:06,155 --> 00:44:09,716
You don't have it signed,
you don't have a ticket to watch the show.

503
00:44:09,859 --> 00:44:11,690
Thank you, Mr. Kung Fu.

504
00:44:13,663 --> 00:44:15,654
Mr. Blue Eyes, thank you.

505
00:44:15,898 --> 00:44:17,889
Elizabeth, my Taylor!

506
00:44:18,334 --> 00:44:19,995
Sophia, my Loren.

507
00:44:20,336 --> 00:44:22,998
Get a haircut.
How many times I got to tell you?

508
00:44:24,173 --> 00:44:26,164
Red, get a new jacket.

509
00:44:29,011 --> 00:44:30,842
Clint, forget your gun?

510
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:32,670
Unfold it.

511
00:44:38,187 --> 00:44:39,518
Hey, you didn't...

512
00:44:39,855 --> 00:44:41,413
Get out of the way.

513
00:44:42,191 --> 00:44:44,625
- You didn't sign it.
- I'm putting school on hold.

514
00:44:44,694 --> 00:44:46,355
Go back until you sign it.

515
00:44:47,196 --> 00:44:50,859
My uncle offered me a job
operating a forklift weekends.

516
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:52,192
So what?

517
00:44:52,768 --> 00:44:55,601
Two years in the union
and I'll make more than you.

518
00:44:57,039 --> 00:45:00,873
The money I'll be making
will buy me a new Trans Am.

519
00:45:01,277 --> 00:45:05,441
Wouldn't you rather be designing
these than repairing them?

520
00:45:05,715 --> 00:45:08,377
You can't even do that.
They got fuel injection.

521
00:45:08,718 --> 00:45:11,710
- You're going to strip my gears.
- What's the problem?

522
00:45:14,890 --> 00:45:16,551
Don't panic, Johnny.

523
00:45:16,692 --> 00:45:19,183
Just watch out for the other guy.

524
00:45:21,631 --> 00:45:23,223
- Right or left?
- Where are we going?

525
00:45:23,299 --> 00:45:25,563
- Right or left!
- Go right!

526
00:45:36,579 --> 00:45:39,980
All you see is the turn.
You don't see the road ahead.

527
00:45:47,590 --> 00:45:50,423
Open the gate. We're going to be late.

528
00:45:51,427 --> 00:45:53,088
Why are you here so early?

529
00:45:53,162 --> 00:45:55,653
We're going to Mr. Escalante's class.

530
00:46:00,536 --> 00:46:02,868
Wake up. Drink some coffee.

531
00:46:08,277 --> 00:46:10,939
One, you got the graph right here.

532
00:46:11,147 --> 00:46:14,310
Two, this is the most important part.
Right here.

533
00:46:14,784 --> 00:46:16,775
The radius of rotation.

534
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:20,282
That's it. Anybody got any questions?

535
00:46:22,291 --> 00:46:25,783
Anybody can do it
if you remember one basic element:

536
00:46:26,128 --> 00:46:27,686
The element of surprise.

537
00:46:27,763 --> 00:46:29,754
Stay awake! Wake up!

538
00:46:30,132 --> 00:46:33,295
Wake up! Bring toothpicks
to pinch open your eyes.

539
00:46:33,703 --> 00:46:35,364
Do you understand, Johnny?

540
00:46:35,538 --> 00:46:38,473
I was swimming with dolphins,
whispering imaginary numbers...

541
00:46:38,541 --> 00:46:41,135
...looking for the fourth dimension.

542
00:46:41,811 --> 00:46:44,302
Go back to sleep. That's very good.

543
00:46:44,513 --> 00:46:46,174
Any questions?

544
00:46:46,582 --> 00:46:48,914
Yes? No? Nothing? Okay.

545
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,332
You should have it by now.

546
00:47:08,838 --> 00:47:10,999
What's the answer? Anybody?

547
00:47:13,609 --> 00:47:15,338
We're going backwards.

548
00:47:15,411 --> 00:47:17,845
You're fooling around too much
on the weekend.

549
00:47:17,947 --> 00:47:20,609
This girl's got to do some work
from the neck up.

550
00:47:21,517 --> 00:47:23,508
We'll have to stay late again.

551
00:47:26,122 --> 00:47:28,613
We can have pizza delivered.

552
00:47:29,191 --> 00:47:32,683
We can get fried chicken, cheeseburgers.

553
00:47:33,429 --> 00:47:37,763
Donations? You owe me money.
You don't deserve the grades you get.

554
00:47:42,037 --> 00:47:44,528
Are you late for another date?

555
00:47:44,874 --> 00:47:47,434
She has more boyfriends
than Elizabeth Taylor!

556
00:47:50,045 --> 00:47:53,913
I don't appreciate you using
my personal life to entertain this class.

557
00:48:22,912 --> 00:48:25,073
Everything is falling apart.

558
00:48:25,181 --> 00:48:27,342
My boyfriend is freaking out!

559
00:48:27,616 --> 00:48:30,949
School sucks.
I'm in that classroom all day, Kimo.

560
00:48:31,754 --> 00:48:36,248
Look at my clothes and my hair.
I can't even comb it. I hate my life.

561
00:48:39,428 --> 00:48:41,259
So what's the problem?

562
00:49:28,177 --> 00:49:32,841
You're going to have to bring him in.
I'm not a doctor, Ma'am.

563
00:49:33,349 --> 00:49:36,682
There's no way. I don't do diagnosis.

564
00:49:44,393 --> 00:49:47,055
Are we going to see the doctor
before next week?

565
00:49:47,396 --> 00:49:49,125
Hold on. ¿Seguro?

566
00:49:51,066 --> 00:49:52,158
Medi-Cal?

567
00:49:52,735 --> 00:49:54,532
How are you going to pay for this?

568
00:49:54,603 --> 00:49:57,538
If we could pay for it,
we'd go to a regular hospital.

569
00:49:57,740 --> 00:50:00,072
My grandmother will
get pneumonia waiting.

570
00:50:00,342 --> 00:50:02,674
Take a seat and we'll call your number.

571
00:50:02,778 --> 00:50:06,942
You have to bring him in.
There's no way around it.

572
00:50:08,350 --> 00:50:11,513
I understand that,
but you have to bring him in.

573
00:50:20,029 --> 00:50:21,690
Try the shortcut.

574
00:50:21,931 --> 00:50:24,923
This is easy. Baby stuff for Boy Scouts.

575
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,861
My mind don't work this way.

576
00:50:27,202 --> 00:50:32,037
Tic-tac-toe. It's a piece of cake,
upside down. Watch for the green light.

577
00:50:38,047 --> 00:50:40,538
I've been with you guys for two years!

578
00:50:40,683 --> 00:50:44,676
Everyone knows I'm the dumbest!
I can't handle calculus!

579
00:50:45,888 --> 00:50:49,119
They have a better chance
on the A.P. Test without me.

580
00:50:51,293 --> 00:50:52,282
Don't laugh!

581
00:50:54,897 --> 00:50:57,127
Laugh! You're breaking our hearts.

582
00:50:57,466 --> 00:50:58,797
Don't do this.

583
00:50:58,867 --> 00:51:03,270
He'll sacrifice himself to benefit the team.
Do you have the ganas!

584
00:51:04,073 --> 00:51:05,233
I have the ganas.

585
00:51:05,407 --> 00:51:07,034
- You want me to do it for you?
- Yes!

586
00:51:07,109 --> 00:51:09,043
You're supposed to say no!

587
00:51:09,912 --> 00:51:11,846
I'm going to have to get tough.

588
00:51:11,981 --> 00:51:14,541
We'll have to work
right through Christmas break.

589
00:51:23,258 --> 00:51:26,091
The counselor was just here
looking for you.

590
00:51:27,096 --> 00:51:30,088
Something about cosmetology classes.

591
00:51:30,766 --> 00:51:33,428
He says, there's three different levels.

592
00:51:33,769 --> 00:51:38,263
One for boys, one for girls and one
for I don't know what. Go find out.

593
00:51:38,507 --> 00:51:40,338
Kimo, listen. It's cool.

594
00:51:40,476 --> 00:51:42,808
- My grandmother...
- Clock out.

595
00:51:43,612 --> 00:51:45,773
Game's over. You lose.

596
00:51:46,615 --> 00:51:48,947
You never listen to nobody, man!

597
00:51:51,453 --> 00:51:53,944
Adiós. Why don't you...

598
00:51:54,123 --> 00:51:57,251
...send me some postcards?
Or call me on the phone, let me know...

599
00:51:57,326 --> 00:51:59,317
...how you're doing? We love you.

600
00:52:02,965 --> 00:52:04,956
Kimo Sabe this, cabrón!

601
00:52:12,141 --> 00:52:15,235
Pancho, that guy has a bigger problem
than you.

602
00:52:17,479 --> 00:52:20,141
Tic-tac-toe.

603
00:52:20,816 --> 00:52:21,714
Simple.

604
00:52:22,651 --> 00:52:26,143
No. She's a little sloppy
with her homework.

605
00:52:26,488 --> 00:52:28,513
Dad, get off the phone so we can eat.

606
00:52:29,992 --> 00:52:31,823
No, she's a top student.

607
00:52:33,328 --> 00:52:37,992
You're father works 60 hours a week,
then volunteers to teach night school.

608
00:52:38,167 --> 00:52:40,328
Merry Christmas to you, too.

609
00:52:42,738 --> 00:52:46,071
Now he's visiting junior high schools
in his spare time.

610
00:52:48,677 --> 00:52:50,338
Corn and potatoes?

611
00:52:50,546 --> 00:52:54,038
What happened to the lomo montado
pica a lo macho?

612
00:52:55,884 --> 00:52:59,047
Jaime, I don't want you to teach
this holiday.

613
00:53:02,191 --> 00:53:03,681
No teaching.

614
00:53:07,696 --> 00:53:09,857
I don't understand this problem.

615
00:53:10,199 --> 00:53:13,862
His own son has problems with math.
Give me that book.

616
00:53:13,969 --> 00:53:16,733
- No books at the table.
- Go wash your hands.

617
00:53:21,543 --> 00:53:22,874
I'll get it.

618
00:53:26,782 --> 00:53:28,374
You see what I mean?

619
00:53:50,172 --> 00:53:52,504
I've seen you do a lot
of underhanded tricks...

620
00:53:52,574 --> 00:53:57,068
...but bringing your abuelita
to my house at Christmastime, come on.

621
00:53:57,579 --> 00:54:00,412
I need calculus to take me
to a good career, Johnny.

622
00:54:02,417 --> 00:54:04,078
Something smells good.

623
00:54:11,093 --> 00:54:14,290
"On the first day of Christmas
A cholo came to me"

624
00:54:15,430 --> 00:54:17,421
This is what's given.

625
00:54:18,033 --> 00:54:21,434
We're looking for the area
in the first quadrant bounded by the curve.

626
00:54:21,503 --> 00:54:23,130
What are the limits? Anybody.

627
00:54:23,205 --> 00:54:24,797
0 to pi/2, sir.

628
00:54:24,973 --> 00:54:26,304
Wrong. Lupe.

629
00:54:26,675 --> 00:54:28,267
0 to pi/2?

630
00:54:29,444 --> 00:54:32,277
What is wrong with you? This is review.

631
00:54:32,481 --> 00:54:34,142
I checked my work twice.

632
00:54:34,516 --> 00:54:35,881
Check it again.

633
00:54:36,018 --> 00:54:37,952
I got the same answer as the gordita.

634
00:54:38,787 --> 00:54:40,618
Don't call me gordita, pendejo.

635
00:54:40,756 --> 00:54:42,747
It's 0 to pi/2, sir.

636
00:54:42,991 --> 00:54:44,982
Yeah, I got the same thing.

637
00:54:45,794 --> 00:54:50,458
You should know this!
What is wrong with you? This is review!

638
00:54:51,066 --> 00:54:53,227
You act like a blind man in a dark room...

639
00:54:53,402 --> 00:54:56,667
...looking for a black cat that isn't there!

640
00:54:57,306 --> 00:55:01,640
I don't believe it. It's giving me a shot
from the back! No way!

641
00:55:04,313 --> 00:55:06,543
Kimo finally blew a head gasket.

642
00:55:07,816 --> 00:55:09,477
It's a pen.

643
00:55:10,853 --> 00:55:12,411
It's a pencil.

644
00:55:14,156 --> 00:55:15,714
It's a chair.

645
00:55:16,992 --> 00:55:18,357
It's a light.

646
00:55:20,662 --> 00:55:22,220
It's a window.

647
00:55:23,899 --> 00:55:27,062
It's in the room, on the table.

648
00:55:27,669 --> 00:55:29,330
It's 10:00.

649
00:55:33,909 --> 00:55:35,240
Un momento, por favor.

650
00:55:35,344 --> 00:55:37,505
One moment, please.

651
00:56:32,334 --> 00:56:34,165
Page 456, please.

652
00:56:35,904 --> 00:56:38,065
Come on, Page 456.

653
00:56:38,307 --> 00:56:40,571
Shut up and sit down.

654
00:56:46,415 --> 00:56:48,076
We told him to take it easy.

655
00:56:48,317 --> 00:56:51,650
It's our fault.
We sit back and watch him burn in.

656
00:56:52,087 --> 00:56:53,748
It's "burn out."

657
00:56:54,756 --> 00:56:57,748
The man brought it on himself.
He was asking for trouble.

658
00:56:57,993 --> 00:56:59,324
How can you say that?

659
00:56:59,494 --> 00:57:01,257
You wanna-be cholo asshole.

660
00:57:05,767 --> 00:57:07,598
That's disgusting!

661
00:57:08,603 --> 00:57:10,935
You want me? I'll kick your ass!

662
00:57:11,273 --> 00:57:12,433
It's Molina!

663
00:57:12,774 --> 00:57:16,767
Break it up! Pancho, just break it up.

664
00:57:17,112 --> 00:57:18,272
Settle down.

665
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:20,541
- Later, dude.
- Settle down, Angel.

666
00:57:26,822 --> 00:57:28,653
Mr. Escalante is okay.

667
00:57:29,925 --> 00:57:33,588
He had a mild heart attack
and he's under observation.

668
00:57:34,796 --> 00:57:37,287
Mr. Schloss is your substitute.

669
00:57:38,133 --> 00:57:42,968
Out of respect to Mr. Escalante,
please give him your undivided attention.

670
00:57:44,306 --> 00:57:46,968
I don't want any more trouble
from this room.

671
00:57:48,310 --> 00:57:51,108
Pancho, you come with me.
Angel, let's go.

672
00:57:54,716 --> 00:57:56,377
Tito, take your seat.

673
00:58:02,324 --> 00:58:04,952
Mr. Molina has informed me that...

674
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:08,493
...you have your A.P. Calculus exam
in two weeks.

675
00:58:09,664 --> 00:58:13,657
To be honest, I've never taught calculus.
I'm really a music teacher.

676
00:58:28,083 --> 00:58:29,744
Are you mad at me, Mommy?

677
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:34,182
If I thought it would help, I would be angry.

678
00:58:38,693 --> 00:58:40,854
The doctor says no stress.

679
00:58:41,196 --> 00:58:44,029
No job-related activity for at least a month.

680
00:58:44,366 --> 00:58:46,197
I want another doctor.

681
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:52,366
I have to go.
I left Fernando with a neighbor.

682
00:58:52,607 --> 00:58:55,542
- I'll stay with Dad.
- No, go with your mother.

683
00:58:56,044 --> 00:58:58,706
Don't forget to take out the trash.

684
00:59:22,237 --> 00:59:24,228
What time do you get off work?

685
00:59:55,170 --> 00:59:57,832
I'm still alive! I'm a hard-dying guy.

686
00:59:58,106 --> 00:59:59,869
Shouldn't you be in the hospital?

687
00:59:59,941 --> 01:00:02,102
No, I should be here with you.

688
01:00:02,577 --> 01:00:03,908
Bulldogs!

689
01:00:04,346 --> 01:00:06,109
Dog, dog, dog, dog.

690
01:00:08,283 --> 01:00:10,615
Thank you for baby-sitting my canguros.

691
01:00:11,219 --> 01:00:12,709
Have a good day.

692
01:00:12,854 --> 01:00:14,446
How are you?

693
01:00:14,856 --> 01:00:16,289
You should take it easy.

694
01:00:16,525 --> 01:00:18,459
Go back to bed, man.

695
01:00:18,693 --> 01:00:20,524
No, I should be here with you.

696
01:00:20,795 --> 01:00:24,094
You already forgot to stand up!
Everybody!

697
01:00:25,467 --> 01:00:28,436
No, against the wall like a snake! Hurry!

698
01:00:29,804 --> 01:00:33,638
We've practiced for this all year.
You're the best!

699
01:00:34,476 --> 01:00:36,467
You guys are the best!

700
01:00:36,811 --> 01:00:38,369
This will be a piece of cake!

701
01:00:38,813 --> 01:00:39,871
Upside down.

702
01:00:40,882 --> 01:00:41,906
And...

703
01:00:42,784 --> 01:00:44,149
Step by step.

704
01:00:44,486 --> 01:00:47,319
You got it now. Open your eyes.

705
01:00:49,357 --> 01:00:52,520
Y = In...

706
01:00:53,161 --> 01:00:55,994
...(x - 1). What is the domain?

707
01:00:56,164 --> 01:00:57,825
X > - 1.

708
01:00:58,166 --> 01:01:01,397
No! End of the line!
I'm gone two days and you forget.

709
01:01:01,670 --> 01:01:02,898
What's the domain?

710
01:01:02,971 --> 01:01:06,202
All real numbers greater than one. X > 1.

711
01:01:07,175 --> 01:01:10,167
I told you, you could do it. Okay!

712
01:01:13,381 --> 01:01:17,875
Be sure each mark is black
and completely filled-in.

713
01:01:18,053 --> 01:01:19,645
If you make an error...

714
01:01:19,721 --> 01:01:23,248
...save time by crossing it out
instead of erasing.

715
01:01:23,892 --> 01:01:28,386
It is not expected that you will
answer all multiple choice questions.

716
01:01:28,730 --> 01:01:31,392
When you're told to begin,
open your booklet.

717
01:01:31,633 --> 01:01:36,070
Tear out the green insert and start work.
You may begin.

718
01:02:07,335 --> 01:02:08,768
Let's go!

719
01:02:27,789 --> 01:02:30,349
I like to keep my pants dry.

720
01:02:34,296 --> 01:02:36,958
The water is great! Come on!

721
01:02:39,467 --> 01:02:41,298
Okay, fine!

722
01:02:41,970 --> 01:02:43,961
This is so stupid!

723
01:02:44,306 --> 01:02:45,637
I'm coming!

724
01:03:15,170 --> 01:03:16,831
Orale, Grandpa!

725
01:04:09,391 --> 01:04:11,552
We, being teachers...

726
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:16,394
...know the Advanced Placement Tests
are very difficult...

727
01:04:16,898 --> 01:04:19,059
...especially in mathematics.

728
01:04:20,235 --> 01:04:24,569
Less than two percent
of all high school seniors nationwide...

729
01:04:24,906 --> 01:04:29,240
...even attempt
the Advanced Placement Calculus Test.

730
01:04:30,979 --> 01:04:32,071
You've been drinking!

731
01:04:32,147 --> 01:04:35,082
I am proud to announce...

732
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:39,242
...that no other high school
in Southern California...

733
01:04:39,487 --> 01:04:41,148
...has more students passing...

734
01:04:41,756 --> 01:04:43,417
...than Garfield High School.

735
01:04:48,430 --> 01:04:50,591
No, he just walks like that.

736
01:04:52,434 --> 01:04:56,268
Eighteen students took the test.
Eighteen passed.

737
01:05:00,108 --> 01:05:02,599
We have an announcement to make.

738
01:05:11,619 --> 01:05:14,452
We, the A.P. Calculus Class...

739
01:05:14,856 --> 01:05:18,622
...would like to present this plaque
to our teacher...

740
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:21,292
...Jaime A. Escalante.

741
01:06:12,547 --> 01:06:14,879
Yes, this is Guadalupe Escobar.

742
01:06:17,318 --> 01:06:19,149
Is this some kind of joke?

743
01:06:20,188 --> 01:06:22,019
Who is this?

744
01:06:23,825 --> 01:06:25,315
For real?

745
01:06:27,195 --> 01:06:28,526
What?

746
01:06:29,030 --> 01:06:30,691
You're crazy, man.

747
01:06:40,875 --> 01:06:44,868
"Tests are graded with the identity
of the student concealed.

748
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:48,477
"Only after irregularities were found
was it determined...

749
01:06:48,550 --> 01:06:53,214
"...that all the students were
from Garfield High." You all got this?

750
01:06:54,722 --> 01:06:57,714
"Based upon the unusual agreement
of incorrect answers...

751
01:06:57,959 --> 01:07:00,450
"...E.T.S. Must question the scores...

752
01:07:00,562 --> 01:07:03,224
"...of all students with
such unusual agreement."

753
01:07:03,731 --> 01:07:05,892
What does it mean in English?

754
01:07:06,134 --> 01:07:09,535
They think we cheated because
we all had the same wrong answers.

755
01:07:09,771 --> 01:07:12,433
We're too stupid
to know how to cheat correctly.

756
01:07:13,007 --> 01:07:14,338
Let's sue them.

757
01:07:14,475 --> 01:07:20,641
"The board doubts the grades are valid
because of these unusual circumstances."

758
01:07:20,915 --> 01:07:23,645
These people are human.
They can make mistakes.

759
01:07:24,919 --> 01:07:28,252
Kimo, these people are calling us cheaters.

760
01:07:31,025 --> 01:07:33,516
This is where we keep
all confidential material...

761
01:07:33,595 --> 01:07:35,961
...S.A.T. And A.P. Tests included.

762
01:07:38,232 --> 01:07:41,326
Only my secretary and I know
the combination.

763
01:07:44,272 --> 01:07:49,437
This controversy is officially
between the E.T.S. And the students.

764
01:07:49,611 --> 01:07:53,411
It does not reflect upon your school
or its administration.

765
01:07:55,116 --> 01:07:58,279
We'd like to resolve this
with as little publicity as possible.

766
01:07:58,386 --> 01:07:59,683
I'd appreciate that.

767
01:08:09,464 --> 01:08:12,297
You think they got the test ahead of time?

768
01:08:14,469 --> 01:08:17,131
Claudia was having emotional problems.

769
01:08:17,472 --> 01:08:19,633
Pancho was way behind.

770
01:08:21,142 --> 01:08:23,133
Do you really think anyone cheated?

771
01:08:25,313 --> 01:08:26,473
No.

772
01:08:26,781 --> 01:08:28,612
But my father does.

773
01:08:30,918 --> 01:08:32,476
Damn shit!

774
01:08:34,122 --> 01:08:35,783
Look at this shit!

775
01:08:35,990 --> 01:08:40,324
If I'd taken that job with my uncle,
I'd have a new car by now!

776
01:08:40,561 --> 01:08:43,428
It's all right. You can fix it.

777
01:08:43,831 --> 01:08:46,493
You can fix it. Just relax.

778
01:08:46,734 --> 01:08:49,168
I didn't know you two were a thing now.

779
01:08:52,306 --> 01:08:53,739
Just something for the summer.

780
01:09:01,683 --> 01:09:03,674
You're an asshole, Pancho.

781
01:09:07,355 --> 01:09:08,515
Shit!

782
01:09:20,468 --> 01:09:23,631
Lots of stars up there, homey.
Not too polluted.

783
01:09:23,871 --> 01:09:26,533
The stars aren't really there, ese.

784
01:09:29,877 --> 01:09:33,040
What you're looking at
is where they used to be.

785
01:09:34,082 --> 01:09:35,743
It takes the light...

786
01:09:35,883 --> 01:09:38,215
...1,000 years to reach the earth.

787
01:09:38,786 --> 01:09:41,949
For all we know,
they burned out a long time ago.

788
01:09:42,023 --> 01:09:45,652
God pulled the plug on us.
He didn't tell nobody.

789
01:09:46,728 --> 01:09:50,220
The stars are out there, homeboy.
I don't care what you say.

790
01:09:58,406 --> 01:09:59,805
Hey, homeboy!

791
01:10:05,246 --> 01:10:07,407
Throw me a kiss, baby!

792
01:10:18,092 --> 01:10:20,925
That's right! That's all you know.

793
01:10:26,434 --> 01:10:28,095
Can't you afford a knife?

794
01:10:28,436 --> 01:10:30,768
Use a pencil, go to jail.

795
01:10:31,105 --> 01:10:35,098
You've got a tough mouth.
You better watch yourself.

796
01:10:38,946 --> 01:10:41,107
Mucho gusto, officer.

797
01:11:03,638 --> 01:11:05,799
That was real smart, ese!

798
01:11:09,076 --> 01:11:10,907
Get away from my ride!

799
01:11:15,249 --> 01:11:16,409
Get up!

800
01:11:17,051 --> 01:11:18,313
Get up!

801
01:11:27,662 --> 01:11:28,993
Where are you going?

802
01:11:30,832 --> 01:11:32,060
Come back!

803
01:12:20,948 --> 01:12:24,384
Well, does anyone have anything to say?

804
01:12:47,074 --> 01:12:49,235
I've known your family for years.

805
01:12:50,077 --> 01:12:51,908
Tell us the truth.

806
01:12:52,580 --> 01:12:54,241
Nothing happened.

807
01:12:54,916 --> 01:12:57,476
- Don't lie to me.
- Nothing happened!

808
01:12:57,752 --> 01:13:01,085
Leave her alone.
She didn't do anything wrong.

809
01:13:01,322 --> 01:13:02,914
Then tell us who did.

810
01:13:17,271 --> 01:13:18,932
We're not cops.

811
01:13:20,374 --> 01:13:22,968
We're not here to put anybody behind bars.

812
01:13:24,111 --> 01:13:26,944
If you cheated,
let us know so you can go home...

813
01:13:27,281 --> 01:13:29,613
...and enjoy the rest of your summer.

814
01:13:47,902 --> 01:13:49,893
I come from this neighborhood.

815
01:13:53,975 --> 01:13:58,071
I know that sometimes we're tempted
to take shortcuts.

816
01:13:59,647 --> 01:14:02,138
Tell me the truth. What happened?

817
01:14:23,437 --> 01:14:25,428
We're busted. Let's admit it.

818
01:14:37,618 --> 01:14:38,744
How did you do it?

819
01:14:43,357 --> 01:14:46,190
I got the test ahead of time
and passed it out.

820
01:14:47,061 --> 01:14:48,221
How did you get it?

821
01:14:49,830 --> 01:14:50,728
The mailman.

822
01:14:54,535 --> 01:14:57,163
I strangled him.
His body's decomposing in my locker.

823
01:15:37,244 --> 01:15:40,236
No sense in continuing
if they won't cooperate.

824
01:16:02,169 --> 01:16:04,137
Do you know how this got in my box?

825
01:16:12,913 --> 01:16:14,744
A letter of resignation.

826
01:16:15,116 --> 01:16:16,447
Anonymous.

827
01:16:19,453 --> 01:16:24,288
My guess is that it has something to do
with the mess this school is in.

828
01:16:27,495 --> 01:16:28,985
Do you think the students cheated?

829
01:16:37,304 --> 01:16:41,968
Mr. Escalante, you put these kids
under an awful lot of pressure.

830
01:16:43,644 --> 01:16:46,306
They would have gone to any lengths
to please you.

831
01:16:46,981 --> 01:16:48,972
You didn't answer my question.

832
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:03,688
Every night I watch the news on Tv.
I see a lot of people go on trial.

833
01:17:04,732 --> 01:17:09,396
They deny everything or their lawyers say
they were insane when they did it.

834
01:17:09,637 --> 01:17:11,628
A lot of them get off.

835
01:17:14,008 --> 01:17:18,001
But I believe most people
who get caught today are guilty...

836
01:17:20,447 --> 01:17:21,880
...don't you?

837
01:17:24,518 --> 01:17:26,679
Yep, I know what you mean.

838
01:17:51,679 --> 01:17:53,169
Have you seen my car?

839
01:17:54,381 --> 01:17:56,042
Do you need a ride home?

840
01:18:02,489 --> 01:18:03,786
No, thank you!

841
01:18:06,527 --> 01:18:08,518
Kimo, let me take you home!

842
01:19:23,470 --> 01:19:25,131
Want to talk about it?

843
01:19:33,147 --> 01:19:37,311
I may have made a mistake trying
to teach them calculus.

844
01:19:40,621 --> 01:19:43,784
Regardless of whether they passed
that test or not...

845
01:19:45,793 --> 01:19:47,192
...they learned.

846
01:19:48,996 --> 01:19:52,989
They learned if you try real hard,
nothing changes.

847
01:19:57,638 --> 01:19:58,730
Quit.

848
01:20:01,508 --> 01:20:03,669
If that's all you have left to teach...

849
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:07,669
...quit.

850
01:20:10,984 --> 01:20:12,645
What kills me...

851
01:20:14,188 --> 01:20:16,520
...is that they lost the confidence...

852
01:20:16,857 --> 01:20:20,850
...in the system they are now
finally qualified to be a part of.

853
01:20:23,864 --> 01:20:28,198
I don't know why I'm losing sleep over this.
I don't need it.

854
01:20:30,704 --> 01:20:33,867
I could make twice the money
and less hours...

855
01:20:34,308 --> 01:20:36,799
...and have people treat me with respect.

856
01:20:39,380 --> 01:20:40,711
Respect?

857
01:20:43,884 --> 01:20:46,148
Jaime, those kids love you.

858
01:20:56,663 --> 01:20:58,221
Hey, Kimo!

859
01:21:07,241 --> 01:21:10,404
Check out your ride!
We fixed it up for you.

860
01:21:10,744 --> 01:21:15,113
It's going downtown
to take action on those E.T.S. Boys.

861
01:21:16,583 --> 01:21:18,414
Dad, check out your new car!

862
01:21:18,952 --> 01:21:21,284
We got to talk about the payments,
though.

863
01:21:44,077 --> 01:21:48,411
I'm Jaime Escalante. I'm the A.P.
Calculus teacher from Garfield High.

864
01:21:51,585 --> 01:21:53,246
I'm Dr. Pearson...

865
01:21:53,921 --> 01:21:55,912
...and this is Dr. Ramirez.

866
01:22:04,698 --> 01:22:08,862
I feel I have a right to know
why you think my students cheated.

867
01:22:15,108 --> 01:22:18,771
I'm sorry you drove all the way out here...

868
01:22:19,179 --> 01:22:21,841
...but we're not at liberty
to discuss the controversy.

869
01:22:22,115 --> 01:22:24,777
I'd just like to see the test, that's all.

870
01:22:27,054 --> 01:22:30,046
I understand what you're going through...

871
01:22:30,691 --> 01:22:34,684
...but the problem is between the E.T.S.
And the students.

872
01:22:35,128 --> 01:22:37,790
I'd just like to see
what kind of mistakes were made.

873
01:22:37,865 --> 01:22:40,698
I'm their teacher. I know my kids.

874
01:22:42,970 --> 01:22:44,631
Mr. Escalante, have a seat.

875
01:22:45,138 --> 01:22:46,366
No, thank you.

876
01:22:49,476 --> 01:22:51,137
There were some...

877
01:22:51,478 --> 01:22:55,471
...unorthodox, even illogical, computations
for students of this caliber.

878
01:22:55,916 --> 01:22:57,577
Mistakes in simple math.

879
01:22:57,818 --> 01:23:02,084
Because they have the same teacher
teaching them the same program.

880
01:23:02,222 --> 01:23:04,884
I taught them step by step,
all the same way.

881
01:23:05,325 --> 01:23:09,921
Your students averaged fewer than
four wrong on the multiple choice...

882
01:23:10,130 --> 01:23:14,294
...where other schools average
14 to 18 incorrect answers.

883
01:23:14,868 --> 01:23:17,962
Most of your kids finished
with time to spare.

884
01:23:18,906 --> 01:23:20,999
They should be rewarded, not punished.

885
01:23:25,345 --> 01:23:27,836
The Educational Testing Service...

886
01:23:28,348 --> 01:23:30,680
...does not act capriciously.

887
01:23:31,785 --> 01:23:35,016
Every major university in the US
subscribes to our service.

888
01:23:35,322 --> 01:23:39,486
I'd just like to see proof of wrongdoing.
I'd like to see the tests.

889
01:23:39,693 --> 01:23:43,527
There is no proof of wrongdoing,
only a suspicion of cheating.

890
01:23:43,864 --> 01:23:45,092
In this country...

891
01:23:45,232 --> 01:23:47,894
...one is innocent until proven guilty.
Not vice versa.

892
01:23:48,869 --> 01:23:53,363
If you are so confident of their abilities,
encourage them to retest.

893
01:23:53,874 --> 01:23:55,034
Why?

894
01:23:55,375 --> 01:23:58,435
If they don't,
everyone will assume they cheated.

895
01:23:58,779 --> 01:24:01,771
Everyone will assume
they cheated if they do.

896
01:24:02,049 --> 01:24:03,710
I want to see the test!

897
01:24:04,051 --> 01:24:08,886
Mr. Escalante, we are psychometricians,
thorough to the point of boring.

898
01:24:09,222 --> 01:24:10,883
We're not out to get anyone.

899
01:24:11,058 --> 01:24:11,752
Wait.

900
01:24:12,225 --> 01:24:15,285
A situation of two students
cheating is one thing.

901
01:24:16,029 --> 01:24:20,022
This blanket accusation is saying
there was a conspiracy.

902
01:24:20,233 --> 01:24:22,258
Every conspiracy has a leader.

903
01:24:22,336 --> 01:24:24,896
Who better qualify to be the leader
than the teacher?

904
01:24:24,972 --> 01:24:27,133
Nobody is accusing you here of anything.

905
01:24:27,407 --> 01:24:31,070
Not only me, the school, the parents,
the entire community!

906
01:24:31,311 --> 01:24:35,145
Scores this high would be questioned
regardless of the school.

907
01:24:35,415 --> 01:24:39,249
But if this was Beverly Hills High
they wouldn't have sent you to investigate.

908
01:24:42,756 --> 01:24:47,591
I hope you're not insinuating
that we haven't earned our position here.

909
01:24:48,428 --> 01:24:50,658
No one has given me a damn thing.

910
01:24:51,598 --> 01:24:55,261
You are letting your emotions
get the best of you.

911
01:24:55,769 --> 01:25:00,433
If no one gave you a damn thing,
you shouldn't take away from my kids!

912
01:25:00,674 --> 01:25:04,269
The identity of the students
was concealed...

913
01:25:04,511 --> 01:25:07,776
...until it was determined
that irregularities existed.

914
01:25:08,281 --> 01:25:13,116
No one would have questioned the scores
if my kids didn't have Spanish surnames...

915
01:25:13,353 --> 01:25:16,015
...and come from barrio schools!

916
01:25:17,958 --> 01:25:22,793
All right. We've explained our position
and heard your complaints, but now...

917
01:25:23,130 --> 01:25:24,859
...our conversation is over.

918
01:25:25,265 --> 01:25:28,257
Something is going on
that nobody is talking about.

919
01:25:28,468 --> 01:25:30,129
And you know what it is!

920
01:25:32,973 --> 01:25:37,808
No one has the right to accuse me
of racism. No one has that right!

921
01:25:38,211 --> 01:25:40,543
I know well how to spell discrimination!

922
01:25:40,881 --> 01:25:45,147
I thought this was over long ago.
Why do this to my kids?

923
01:25:45,819 --> 01:25:48,982
There are two kinds of racism,
Mr. Escalante.

924
01:25:49,423 --> 01:25:52,119
Singling out a group
who are members of a minority...

925
01:25:52,192 --> 01:25:55,184
...and not singling out a group
who are members of a minority.

926
01:25:55,595 --> 01:25:58,325
My kids could teach you
a thing or two, Johnny!

927
01:25:59,132 --> 01:26:01,965
I'll call security
if you can't control yourself.

928
01:26:02,069 --> 01:26:02,899
Do it!

929
01:26:04,137 --> 01:26:08,267
You didn't prove anything.
My kids didn't do anything!

930
01:26:08,408 --> 01:26:10,239
I'll prove you guys wrong.

931
01:26:10,677 --> 01:26:14,374
I hope you do
because this is not between you and me.

932
01:26:16,683 --> 01:26:17,877
Maybe not.

933
01:26:18,485 --> 01:26:22,444
But if I catch you on the street,
I'll kick the shit out of you.

934
01:26:26,860 --> 01:26:29,021
This is Guadalupe Escobar.

935
01:26:29,596 --> 01:26:31,587
I'm going to take the test again.

936
01:26:32,666 --> 01:26:33,997
You're kidding!

937
01:26:34,801 --> 01:26:37,031
Kimo, we only have one day to study.

938
01:26:42,542 --> 01:26:45,033
8:00 a.m. On Tuesday. Thank you.

939
01:26:45,812 --> 01:26:47,473
You didn't let me talk to them.

940
01:26:47,614 --> 01:26:49,946
Call collect. Stick them with a big bill.

941
01:26:54,054 --> 01:26:56,614
Thought I'd seen this place
for the last time.

942
01:26:59,559 --> 01:27:03,051
We'll have to review the whole course
in one shot.

943
01:27:03,530 --> 01:27:06,021
- In one day?
- Can't do it in any less.

944
01:27:06,233 --> 01:27:08,224
Maybe they'll give us the same test.

945
01:27:09,236 --> 01:27:12,569
It will be harder. You can count on that.

946
01:27:14,407 --> 01:27:17,399
Just go step by step and play defense.

947
01:27:18,578 --> 01:27:22,571
Don't bring anything.
No pencils, no erasers, nothing.

948
01:27:23,083 --> 01:27:25,916
Don't wear clothes with too many pockets.

949
01:27:26,586 --> 01:27:30,078
Don't let your eyes wander.
No spacing out.

950
01:27:30,757 --> 01:27:33,920
Don't give them any opportunity
to call you cheaters.

951
01:27:35,929 --> 01:27:38,159
You are the true dreamers.

952
01:27:38,932 --> 01:27:41,594
And dreams accomplish wonderful things.

953
01:27:42,836 --> 01:27:44,497
You're the best.

954
01:27:44,871 --> 01:27:47,704
Tomorrow you'll prove
that you're the champs.

955
01:27:49,109 --> 01:27:50,940
Start with Chapter 1.

956
01:28:04,291 --> 01:28:06,452
Kimo, what you making there?

957
01:28:06,626 --> 01:28:11,461
You like brains? Good. I was afraid
you guys wouldn't appreciate it.

958
01:28:11,965 --> 01:28:14,456
This food lasts for 24-hours.

959
01:28:15,135 --> 01:28:17,968
You're afraid we're going
to screw up royally tomorrow.

960
01:28:19,406 --> 01:28:21,067
Tomorrow is just another day.

961
01:28:21,308 --> 01:28:24,300
I'm afraid you'll screw up
the rest of your lives.

962
01:28:31,885 --> 01:28:34,877
I'm fried. I don't care
if I don't pass that test.

963
01:28:35,155 --> 01:28:38,488
- Sit down. We got a lot of work to do.
- I'm going home.

964
01:28:40,994 --> 01:28:42,325
Sit down.

965
01:28:42,996 --> 01:28:45,988
I'm tired and I'm going home. Okay?

966
01:28:46,499 --> 01:28:50,333
- Do you know what you're doing?
- I'm going home, that's what.

967
01:29:01,014 --> 01:29:03,175
It's almost ready. Who wants some?

968
01:29:03,617 --> 01:29:05,448
Let's order out, man.

969
01:29:06,419 --> 01:29:07,750
Just kidding.

970
01:30:01,908 --> 01:30:03,569
I had to see you.

971
01:30:04,311 --> 01:30:07,803
You can't expect me to be your girlfriend
at your convenience.

972
01:30:14,587 --> 01:30:15,986
I'm an asshole.

973
01:30:19,426 --> 01:30:20,586
Sorry.

974
01:31:24,290 --> 01:31:27,953
I'm sure you're all familiar
with the procedure.

975
01:31:29,095 --> 01:31:33,759
You have 90 minutes to complete
the multiple choice section.

976
01:31:34,267 --> 01:31:36,758
Do not fill in answers by guessing.

977
01:31:37,003 --> 01:31:39,494
Wrong answers will be counted
against you.

978
01:31:40,673 --> 01:31:43,335
You may begin Part 1, now.

979
01:33:14,934 --> 01:33:16,765
Okay, pencils down.

980
01:33:22,642 --> 01:33:26,134
You have 90 minutes to complete
the free-response section.

981
01:33:26,846 --> 01:33:30,577
Do not spend too much time
on any particular answer.

982
01:33:32,418 --> 01:33:35,410
Credit will be issued for partial solutions.

983
01:33:36,956 --> 01:33:40,448
Open the booklet, begin Part 2. Good luck.

984
01:35:23,129 --> 01:35:25,620
- Finished?
- No, I can't finish the test.

985
01:35:26,566 --> 01:35:30,400
I have a scholarship appointment at U.S.C.

986
01:35:30,903 --> 01:35:33,201
- Can't that wait?
- No, it can't.

987
01:35:35,975 --> 01:35:37,806
Did you fill out your ID card?

988
01:35:50,757 --> 01:35:52,748
Okay, pencils down.

989
01:36:24,957 --> 01:36:28,290
Did you hear the news?
We got the computers.

990
01:36:28,961 --> 01:36:30,792
Yep, that'll do it.

991
01:36:50,683 --> 01:36:55,017
They want to go over the test again
so that there's no misunderstandings.

992
01:37:00,493 --> 01:37:02,825
I'm on my way to the faculty meeting.

993
01:37:03,329 --> 01:37:05,490
Misunderstanding again?

994
01:37:06,065 --> 01:37:08,727
Call Dr. Ramirez. He'll help us.

995
01:37:08,901 --> 01:37:10,994
He'll tell me the same thing.

996
01:37:12,438 --> 01:37:14,099
All right, I'll call him.

997
01:37:32,024 --> 01:37:35,858
This is Mr. Molina calling again.
Can I speak to...

998
01:37:36,829 --> 01:37:38,057
Yes, I did.

999
01:37:39,165 --> 01:37:40,598
You do?

1000
01:37:42,368 --> 01:37:45,201
Yes! I'd like that very much.

1001
01:37:46,205 --> 01:37:47,536
One moment.

1002
01:37:49,208 --> 01:37:51,938
Yes, I'm aware of the scoring.

1003
01:37:52,044 --> 01:37:55,207
Three is a passing grade,
five is a perfect grade.

1004
01:37:55,615 --> 01:37:57,276
I'm ready. Go ahead.

1005
01:37:57,717 --> 01:38:00,379

1006

1008
01:38:07,393 --> 01:38:09,884
I want the original scores reinstated.

01:38:10,229 --> 01:38:12,060

1010

01:38:38,591 --> 01:38:39,751
...five.

1019
01:38:40,726 --> 01:38:44,059
Tell them to hold the meeting.
We have great news.

1020
01:38:44,597 --> 01:38:46,929
