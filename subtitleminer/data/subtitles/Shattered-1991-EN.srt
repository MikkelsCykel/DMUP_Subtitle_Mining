1
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:22,997
How do you feel?

2
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:28,365
I'm Dr. Berkus,
Marin County Hospital...

3
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:33,378
and you are one
very lucky woman, Mrs. Merrick.

4
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:35,471
I wish I could say the same
for your husband.

5
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,849
No.

6
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:43,650
We're doing everything we can,
but you have to understand...

7
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:46,715
he went all the way down
in that car.

8
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:48,590
He's in a deep coma.

9
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,183
Honey...

10
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,853
it's me, darling.

11
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,896
It's Judith.

12
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:26,921
Who?

13
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,938
It's me...

14
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:34,303
Judith.

15
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,916
We call that
psychogenic amnesia.

16
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,584
The patient doesn't know
his name, his family...

17
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,992
his personal history.
Everything else, he remembers...

18
00:04:56,062 --> 00:05:00,123
the year, who's president.
He can drive a car.

19
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:02,190
He can function professionally.

20
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:05,066
But anything personal
is out of reach.

21
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,537
For how long?

22
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:10,133
Could be... a week.

23
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:12,677
I'm going to have to be honest.

24
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:14,736
It could also be permanent.

25
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:49,777
Mexico. Cabo San Lucas...

26
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,579
Our vacation with Jeb
and Jenny last year.

27
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,908
Oh, darling, don't.

28
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,240
I'm so afraid.

29
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:24,849
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

30
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:26,885
You're alive.

31
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:30,786
And you're not alone.

32
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:35,060
I'll always be with you.

33
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:38,430
Always.

34
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:49,908
Do you know who they are?

35
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:53,207
Sure. You told me.
That's Jeb and Jenny Scott.

36
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:57,381
She's kind of attractive.

37
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:01,682
Oh, yeah. She also writes
horoscopes and reads palms.

38
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:04,382
I take it she's not an active
part of the business.

39
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:07,051
Her contribution
to Merrick-Scott development...

40
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:10,755
is to spend Jeb's money so fast
it keeps him hustling.

41
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,819
Hustling?

42
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:14,332
He's a real killer.
Remember, I told you...

43
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,664
It hurts. It hurts!

44
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:19,762
You know the therapist said
you have to do this.

45
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,587
They had this on the jukebox...

46
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:37,714
in that funky little bar
in Mexico.

47
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,917
You put it on so many times...

48
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:43,155
some drunk offered us
10,000 pesos to give it a rest.

49
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:44,161
Did we accept?

50
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,198
10,000 pesos is only $5.00.

51
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:48,563
We were insulted.

52
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:53,935
Dan, should I tell you...

53
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:55,633
what I want more than anything?

54
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:56,766
When we're through here...

55
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:58,003
I want to go back to Mexico.

56
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:00,511
Jeb can ride out
the marina development.

57
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:04,175
That's his baby anyway.
And besides, he owes you, Dan.

58
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:08,312
We need time together.

59
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:09,684
Alone.

60
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:12,189
Sounds OK to me.

61
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:14,351
After I get back
to San Francisco...

62
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:17,191
find out where I live,
where I work.

63
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:46,555
Mexico.

64
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:51,186
Shall I tell you
what we used to do there...

65
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:53,232
on that beach at night?

66
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,669
Shall I tell you?

67
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:00,700
Shall I?

68
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:02,172
Yes.

69
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:16,241
Remember?

70
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:18,078
Yes. Yes, I do.

71
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,243
That's the Transamerica
building, right?

72
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:22,378
Right, and on the 36th floor...

73
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,320
Merrick-Scott Development.

74
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:02,589
Oh, wow.

75
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:07,097
Hey, I know this place.

76
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,861
You really remember?

77
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:10,196
Well, I don't know...

78
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:12,294
but I could swear
I've been here before.

79
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:27,051
Don't say anything.

80
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:35,453
Hello?

81
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:36,825
Oh, hi, Jeb.

82
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:39,865
No. We just got back.

83
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:41,126
Oh, he's fine.

84
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,633
He's a little tired.

85
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:45,703
Well...

86
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:47,170
thanks, Jeb, but you know...

87
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:51,972
we just want to lie low
for the first few days.

88
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,409
That would be great.

89
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:55,379
No. I promise.

90
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:57,382
OK.

91
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:01,684
Well, maybe next weekend.

92
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:03,187
OK.

93
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:05,723
Love to Jenny. Bye.

94
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:23,799
Dan!

95
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:27,244
Stop! No! Dan!

96
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:34,509
Darling, I'm here to help.

97
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:35,849
Easy.

98
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:39,490
We were warned
this might happen.

99
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,985
Remember, we're a team.

100
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:47,094
We'll face this together.

101
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,421
There's something
about this room.

102
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:12,684
These mirrors
just make me crazy.

103
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:14,692
I'm so sorry.

104
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:18,719
If something here upsets you,
let's just go away.

105
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,528
We'll leave tonight
if you want to.

106
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,727
I don't want to go.

107
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:27,967
Whatever you want.

108
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,572
Careful.

109
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:46,285
Jesus.

110
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:55,256
Where'd you get thrown out?

111
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,234
I don't know.

112
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:59,362
Up there somewhere.

113
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:02,601
I was pretty smashed, huh?

114
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:07,009
Well, Jeb's idea of playing host
is soak the guests.

115
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:09,843
He did everything
but pour it over our heads.

116
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:12,179
So...

117
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:13,946
happy New Year.

118
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:19,287
You know what I like
about amnesia?

119
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,690
What?

120
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,696
Well, after seven years
of marriage...

121
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:29,200
I get to fall in love with you
all over again.

122
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:31,702
Oh, Dan.

123
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,237
I mean it.

124
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:38,709
Hey, was I always
this sentimental?

125
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:41,769
No, but don't stop.

126
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:51,620
- Hi.
- Oh, Jenny.

127
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:52,952
Is something wrong?

128
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:55,220
No. I was just running
for the phone.

129
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:57,728
- How's Dan? Is he OK?
- Yes.

130
00:14:57,796 --> 00:14:59,229
Really?
Everything's fine?

131
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:03,166
Yes. Dan's getting back
to his old routines.

132
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,169
That's great, great news.

133
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:06,431
Yes.

134
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:08,370
Back in shape?

135
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,408
Yes, he is.

136
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:16,271
Yeah.

137
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,581
Yes, he does, Jenny.

138
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,846
He looks great.

139
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,356
He sounds sexier than ever.

140
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:23,969
So here you are.

141
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:26,839
Jenny tried to bully us...

142
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:28,880
into going over there
for dinner tonight...

143
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:31,438
but I said you weren't
quite ready for it.

144
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:34,879
Dan?

145
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:38,279
Is something the matter?

146
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:42,752
We can go over there
if you want to.

147
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:44,193
I just thought...

148
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:45,321
No.

149
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:54,838
I'd like to go.

150
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:15,255
Hell of a thing, pal,
when you think about it, huh?

151
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:18,194
Start a new life,
see everything with a fresh eye.

152
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,754
Kind of like being a kid again.

153
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,698
It definitely has its upside.

154
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,963
Boy, when I think of some of
the things I'd like to forget.

155
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:28,006
Like the time when I was 15...
I took Mary Louise McBirney...

156
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:30,974
to Lou Ann's Diner on a date.
I came up two bucks short.

157
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:33,102
She called her father
to come and bail us out.

158
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:35,669
He called me
"a pathetic little pissant!"

159
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:37,305
He spoke like that.

160
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:39,748
Anyway, he scared
the shit out of me.

161
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:41,410
I couldn't get it up
again for two years.

162
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:44,479
I was a virgin
until I was seventeen.

163
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:47,616
Dan, it's so good
to have you home.

164
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:51,151
I can't even imagine how ghastly
this has been for you.

165
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,164
We really wanted
to visit you...

166
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:55,427
in the hospital,
but Judith just insisted...

167
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:58,595
Oh, lord. It wasn't me, Jenny.
It was the doctors.

168
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:01,138
The psychiatrist
vetoed all visits...

169
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:02,969
till the surgery was over.

170
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,440
I thought Dan needed...

171
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,978
all the memory stimulation
he could get...

172
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:09,411
but the doctors
left it all to me.

173
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:13,850
It's been very strange
and very wonderful.

174
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,820
Like being shipwrecked
on a desert island...

175
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:19,790
having to rediscover
each other again.

176
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:21,951
All right. Let's get serious.

177
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:24,461
When do you think you might
want to, you know...

178
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:27,761
start phasing your way
back into the office?

179
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,164
Tomorrow.

180
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:31,202
Look, I didn't mean
to rush you, pal.

181
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,295
I gotta back and forth
to L.A. All week.

182
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:34,498
Well, l...

183
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:37,440
No. No. I don't...
you probably forgot...

184
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:38,601
Forget it.

185
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:45,211
No, but I feel the sooner
I start, the better.

186
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:47,377
Find out what kind
of player I am...

187
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:50,012
or if I'm just dead weight.

188
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:52,022
I did your chart today, Dan.

189
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:54,320
Every sign is positive for you.

190
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:56,623
Do you really think
you're ready for this?

191
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,185
Don't you think I am?

192
00:19:58,263 --> 00:20:00,231
Listen, why don't you
come back in tomorrow morning?

193
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:03,928
We'll find out.
But right now, come on, pal...

194
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:07,369
let's us boys go do a brandy
and business, huh?

195
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:09,304
Honey, why don't you
show Judith...

196
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,966
whatever it is
that you bought today?

197
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:17,510
In this unreliable
old world, about the...

198
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:20,211
about the only thing
I can count on for sure...

199
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:22,344
is that Jenny has been out
hitting the stores.

200
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:27,922
Well, Jenny,
you buy anything gorgeous?

201
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:30,052
Who gives a shit?

202
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:32,289
Wait until you see
what we're doing...

203
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:33,854
with the marina development.

204
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:37,561
We're gonna clear five big ones
on the first phase alone.

205
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:41,265
I think I finessed Miller
down at City Hall...

206
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,672
so all we have to do
to get past go...

207
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:46,939
is be a little creative
on our teamster deal.

208
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:49,981
- I need to ask you a question.
- Shoot.

209
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:52,448
Before the accident,
was I having trouble...

210
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:54,451
with Judith, with my marriage?

211
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:56,384
We all have trouble
with our marriage.

212
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:57,547
What we've gotta address...

213
00:20:57,623 --> 00:20:59,056
is how to avoid trouble
with the teamsters.

214
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:01,684
Jeb, I need to talk,
really talk.

215
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,887
You mentioned divorce
a couple of times...

216
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:05,395
but you were drinking.
So what?

217
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:07,125
Jenny threatens divorce
once a month.

218
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,723
I mentioned divorce?

219
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,597
Yeah, that night at the party.

220
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:12,796
Aw, come on, pal.

221
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:15,066
You were juiced.
We were all juiced.

222
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:18,075
Listen, Dan,
you must know that, uh...

223
00:21:18,143 --> 00:21:20,202
you know,
I feel kind of guilty.

224
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,144
I mean...

225
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:24,307
how was it between Judith
and me that night?

226
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:25,315
What does it matter now?

227
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:26,476
Were we arguing?

228
00:21:26,551 --> 00:21:28,451
No, you were not arguing.

229
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,956
You were fucking screaming
at each other!

230
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:39,490
Judith was having
an affair, right?

231
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:41,964
How the hell should I know?

232
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:43,763
But I'll tell you this much.

233
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:46,804
If she was,
who could blame her?

234
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:48,601
What does that mean?

235
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:52,576
It means you treated her like
a piece of goddamn furniture.

236
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:57,340
Down in Cabo San Lucas...

237
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,441
it was fuckin' embarrassing.

238
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:00,678
In Mexico?

239
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,614
Jeb, can't business wait?

240
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,749
When do I get to talk to Dan?

241
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:09,952
He's all yours, babe.

242
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:17,835
I'm not a fool.

243
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:22,796
I can tell how uneasy you are.

244
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:24,603
Let me help you.

245
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:29,813
I don't know.
I need somebody...

246
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:32,714
to tell me the truth
about a few things...

247
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:34,843
about my life.

248
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:40,449
Well, Jeb says...

249
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,220
What did Jeb tell you?

250
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,523
What a shit I was to Judith.

251
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:51,034
What you were to her?

252
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,132
Did he tell you about Mexico?

253
00:22:57,843 --> 00:23:00,038
- About Stanton?
- Who?

254
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:02,012
Jack Stanton.

255
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,875
You met him in Cabo.

256
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,454
Claimed to be
a fellow architect.

257
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:15,585
We all smelled a rat...
except Judith.

258
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:18,151
She never let him
out of her sight.

259
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,893
She even had him follow her
back here to San Francisco.

260
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:24,902
What the hell
are you getting at?

261
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,597
You wanted the truth.

262
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:30,004
I'm telling you the truth.

263
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,202
I saw them...

264
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:34,142
up at the Hacienda.

265
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:36,009
The day before the accident.

266
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,072
- Where?
- The Hacienda...

267
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:40,812
the hotel up in Ross.

268
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:43,320
I saw Stanton's red Porsche
out front...

269
00:23:43,388 --> 00:23:45,583
right next
to the white Mercedes.

270
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:47,124
Wait a minute.

271
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:51,629
You're saying this guy
Stanton...

272
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:54,961
is the only person in
Marin County with a red Porsche?

273
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:57,297
Judith's the only one
with a white Mercedes?

274
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:59,303
Hey, do me a favor, OK?

275
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:02,602
You came this close
to being killed.

276
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:05,472
She didn't even
sprain her ankle.

277
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:06,977
You think about that.

278
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:10,814
She was thrown clear.

279
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:14,443
Was she falling...

280
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:15,713
or jumping?

281
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:21,386
Well?

282
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,809
May I help you?

283
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:20,611
Why, it's Mr. Merrick,
isn't it?

284
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:23,210
Rudy Costa, assistant manager.

285
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:26,189
It's so wonderful
to have you back, Mr. Merrick.

286
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:28,852
You look great!
You lost some weight...

287
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:31,395
but none the worse
for the accident.

288
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:32,828
Why, thank you.

289
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:35,526
Is there anything
I can do for you?

290
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,694
Maybe.
I'm looking for a woman...

291
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:41,330
who I think used to come here.

292
00:25:41,406 --> 00:25:42,839
You know her?

293
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:45,604
Sure. But Mr. Merrick...

294
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:48,646
we are very discreet here,
as you know.

295
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:50,146
Mr. uh...

296
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,409
- Costa.
- Costa...

297
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:56,477
this is a very sensitive
situation for me.

298
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,819
I lost track of her when
I was in the hospital...

299
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,653
and I...

300
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:02,693
well, I'm sure you understand.

301
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:05,093
Sure.

302
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:07,893
But, uh, still...

303
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:15,563
Well...

304
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:28,776
for a while,
she used to come in every day.

305
00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:31,083
Always in the afternoon,
as I recall...

306
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:33,784
and always
with the same gentleman.

307
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:35,689
But then it stopped.

308
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,955
What was the gentleman's name?

309
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:41,795
His name?
Yes, what was his name?

310
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:44,960
You know, I can't quite remem...

311
00:26:45,036 --> 00:26:46,970
Wait a minute. It, uh...

312
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:48,801
it was Stanley something.

313
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:49,931
No... no...

314
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:51,976
it was Stanton.
Yes, that was it...

315
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:53,305
Stanton.

316
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:56,313
Good-looking guy,
kind of close-mouthed.

317
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:59,908
Discreet,
if you know what I mean.

318
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:04,251
He and the lady would always
arrive separately.

319
00:27:04,322 --> 00:27:07,257
Mr. Merrick,
can I offer you a drink?

320
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:08,952
Thank you, Mr. Costa.

321
00:27:10,495 --> 00:27:12,053
Thank you, Mr. Merrick...

322
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:15,429
and be sure to give
my kind regards to your wife.

323
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:21,965
My wife?

324
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:36,546
Here we are...

325
00:27:40,525 --> 00:27:42,891
our new marina complex.

326
00:27:45,363 --> 00:27:47,297
That's the Merrick-Scott Tower.

327
00:27:47,365 --> 00:27:50,801
We got most of it rented off
at 42 bucks a square foot...

328
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:53,303
but the top five floors
are all ours.

329
00:27:53,371 --> 00:27:54,303
That's great.

330
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:55,498
Yeah, you bet.

331
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:58,672
Very impressive, Jeb.

332
00:27:58,743 --> 00:28:01,234
Well, it was your design, pal.

333
00:28:01,312 --> 00:28:02,574
Aw, I didn't...

334
00:28:02,647 --> 00:28:04,808
Don't you remember at first?
You had the E.P.A. guy...

335
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:08,250
so far up your ass,
you had heartburn.

336
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:10,753
Boy, the way
you handled that...

337
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:11,754
sheer poetry.

338
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:12,755
Really?

339
00:28:12,824 --> 00:28:14,257
Your ticket, Jeb.

340
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:15,257
Thanks.

341
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:16,588
What did I do?

342
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:18,788
Homework. You found out
about the pretty young boy...

343
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:20,353
he was spending
his nights with...

344
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:22,366
when his wife thought
he was off working the files.

345
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:25,426
You had a friendly
little chat with him...

346
00:28:25,503 --> 00:28:26,595
no more heartburn.

347
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:28,263
I was a real prince, huh?

348
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:31,001
Oh, prince of princes.
Now, Dan...

349
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:35,308
I'd like you to meet
your secretary Nancy Mercer.

350
00:28:37,682 --> 00:28:39,115
Welcome back... Dan.

351
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:40,446
Thank you.

352
00:28:40,518 --> 00:28:42,179
I really mean it.

353
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:44,312
It's ten after.
I'm gonna miss my plane.

354
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:47,290
Now, if there's anything
you need...

355
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:48,757
Nancy'll handle it.

356
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:50,055
Welcome back, pal.

357
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:52,222
Thanks, Jeb.

358
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:31,461
Klein's Animal House.

359
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:36,406
Listen,
if this is a breather...

360
00:29:36,474 --> 00:29:39,272
can you wait
while I get a cigarette?

361
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:41,608
Sorry, wrong number.

362
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,442
Here we go.

363
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:45,779
Black with Sweet 'N' Low.

364
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:48,819
That's the way
you used to take it.

365
00:29:53,224 --> 00:29:54,816
Thank you, Nancy.

366
00:29:58,363 --> 00:30:00,957
Is something wrong?

367
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:05,628
Oh, no.

368
00:30:05,703 --> 00:30:08,934
Tell me something...
last Christmas...

369
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:11,271
did I buy anybody pets?

370
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:13,310
Pets?

371
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:15,312
Well, not that I recall.

372
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:18,178
Mostly it was gift certificates
to Neiman's.

373
00:30:18,249 --> 00:30:20,183
Jesus.

374
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:21,741
Personal touch, huh?

375
00:30:22,787 --> 00:30:24,049
Nancy, tell me something.

376
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:26,317
Does this name... Klein...

377
00:30:26,391 --> 00:30:28,291
Does that mean anything to you?

378
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:30,987
Oh, yeah. That guy.

379
00:30:31,062 --> 00:30:34,054
Mr. Klein called several times
back in January...

380
00:30:34,132 --> 00:30:36,032
regarding
an outstanding invoice.

381
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,795
But since he wouldn't say
what it was for...

382
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:38,801
I didn't pay him.

383
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,770
I have it on file
if you'd like it.

384
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,864
- Yeah, I would, thanks.
- OK.

385
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:52,873
Nancy? Have you ever heard
of a place called the Hacienda?

386
00:30:55,887 --> 00:30:57,149
Yeah.

387
00:30:57,222 --> 00:30:59,884
Yes, I have.

388
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:01,823
Why?

389
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:03,827
Well, I'm just wondering.

390
00:31:03,895 --> 00:31:05,328
Just wondering.

391
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:12,162
Did we ever spend
any time there together...

392
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:13,795
you and I?

393
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:17,330
Just the two of us?

394
00:31:17,408 --> 00:31:19,239
You and I?

395
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,709
At the Hacienda?

396
00:31:20,778 --> 00:31:22,905
- Yeah.
- No.

397
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:25,006
Oh. OK.

398
00:31:26,117 --> 00:31:27,641
It's all right.

399
00:31:29,487 --> 00:31:30,579
Thanks.

400
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:39,920
$7,000?

401
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:44,000
Can't you read? We're closed.

402
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:48,164
I know, but I need to speak
to Mr. Klein about this.

403
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,706
Oh, all right.

404
00:31:54,512 --> 00:31:57,538
You guaranteed me that once
this bird got to know me...

405
00:31:57,615 --> 00:31:59,674
it would talk!
I've had it for six months...

406
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,582
and it hasn't
even opened its beak!

407
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:03,416
I said that Clementine
could talk.

408
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:05,285
I didn't say that she would!

409
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:07,290
OK, I'm sorry. No problem.

410
00:32:07,358 --> 00:32:09,986
Sorry about your inconvenience.

411
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,222
Silly old bitch!

412
00:32:13,298 --> 00:32:15,232
Yeah! You see?

413
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:18,098
- Silly old bitch!
- What can I do for you?

414
00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:19,534
According to this invoice...

415
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:21,629
I bought enough animals
to fill a zoo.

416
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:23,640
$7,000... that's ridiculous.

417
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:26,302
Merrick?

418
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:27,810
Oh, Mr. Merrick!

419
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:29,608
I didn't recognize you there.

420
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:30,943
I had this bad car accident.

421
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:33,643
Yeah, yeah. So I heard.

422
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:35,652
- Sadie!
- Yeah?

423
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,153
Close up the shop!

424
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:40,156
Oh! And take another look around
for Betty June.

425
00:32:40,224 --> 00:32:41,486
Right.

426
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:43,322
Come with me.

427
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:44,986
Welcome home, sweetheart.

428
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:46,655
Welcome home!

429
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:48,892
Silly old bitch!

430
00:32:51,402 --> 00:32:52,869
There you go, honey.

431
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:56,836
Poor old Twigs.

432
00:32:56,908 --> 00:32:59,775
He got hit by a car.
He's lost control.

433
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:03,837
So, what did I buy
for seven grand? A gorilla?

434
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:05,143
You don't remember?

435
00:33:05,216 --> 00:33:06,615
Oh, amnesia.

436
00:33:06,684 --> 00:33:08,743
I blacked out on everything
before the accident.

437
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,983
Wow. That can be a tough one.

438
00:33:12,056 --> 00:33:15,321
I'm afraid all you bought
was a lot of my time.

439
00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:19,762
Some of my photographic art.

440
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:24,564
I guess "gorilla"
wasn't too far off the mark.

441
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:27,468
There was a guy named...

442
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:28,800
Jack Stanton.

443
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:31,671
He was doing a little
chimney sweeping with your wife.

444
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:33,802
You hired me to stake him out
last Christmas.

445
00:33:33,878 --> 00:33:36,972
Holiday surcharge
and no lunch breaks...

446
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:38,310
it all adds up.

447
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:41,181
I sent you the contact strips
New Year's Eve...

448
00:33:41,252 --> 00:33:42,981
then I waited for my money.

449
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:45,750
Just as I was beginning to
figure that I'd been stiffed...

450
00:33:45,823 --> 00:33:47,814
and I was gonna have
to use a little muscle...

451
00:33:47,892 --> 00:33:49,325
who shows up but Mrs. Merrick?

452
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:51,862
- Mrs. Merrick?
- Yeah. Your wife.

453
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:54,864
She paid your bill.
She's a nice lady.

454
00:33:54,932 --> 00:33:57,560
I got paid,
the animals got fed.

455
00:33:57,635 --> 00:33:59,535
You are a private investigator?

456
00:33:59,604 --> 00:34:03,563
Yeah, yeah.
I paid my dues for thirty years.

457
00:34:03,641 --> 00:34:07,168
You spend that long
peeping through keyholes...

458
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:10,214
you kind of lose confidence
in the human species.

459
00:34:13,284 --> 00:34:18,051
Plus the hours and the food
and the bad vibes...

460
00:34:18,122 --> 00:34:20,852
kind of took a toll
on my health.

461
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:24,326
Now I only do it to pay the rent
and feed the animals.

462
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:27,091
Are you satisfied?

463
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:29,861
Case closed?

464
00:34:29,934 --> 00:34:33,768
Let me put it this way,
Mr. Klein...

465
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:35,772
don't you find it
a little odd...

466
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,331
that on the same day
you gave me those pictures...

467
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,877
my wife and I had
a terrible accident?

468
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:42,913
She gets thrown out
with hardly a scratch...

469
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,538
I wind up looking
like hamburger.

470
00:34:44,615 --> 00:34:47,709
What, you think
she planned it? Come on!

471
00:34:47,785 --> 00:34:50,948
Unless your wife
was into serious acrobatics...

472
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:54,480
I'd say that your imagination
is working overtime.

473
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:56,584
You want my advice? Forget it.

474
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:59,391
OK, so she had an affair.

475
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:02,956
You've never had an affair,
Mr. Merrick?

476
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:06,492
Yeah. As a matter
of fact, I did...

477
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:08,630
but I can't remember who with.

478
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:14,140
That could keep a guy
on his toes.

479
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:20,615
Look, Mr. Klein...

480
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:25,122
I'd like to hire you again
to find out...

481
00:35:25,189 --> 00:35:27,419
a little bit more
about this Jack Stanton.

482
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:29,790
And I'd be glad to take
your money, but...

483
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:32,295
as I don't believe
in exploiting animals...

484
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:34,797
occasionally
I get a little soft...

485
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:37,130
and extend that code
to human beings.

486
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:40,466
Look, the way I see it,
you both had an affair...

487
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:43,063
and now you love each other.

488
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:46,804
Great! Save your money.
Forget the guy.

489
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:49,806
Kind of pretty, ain't he?

490
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:51,974
He's not my type.

491
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:54,279
Mr. Klein...

492
00:35:54,352 --> 00:35:56,115
don't move.

493
00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:58,815
There's a snake
right behind you.

494
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:04,260
Oh, yeah... Betty June!

495
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:05,920
I've been looking for you!

496
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,157
Where you been, honey?

497
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:08,425
Ain't she pretty?

498
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,296
- Sadie!
- Yeah?

499
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,893
- I found Betty June!
- Oh, good!

500
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:15,097
Yeah. She was
in the filing cabinet.

501
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:14,759
Dan?

502
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:21,601
Maybe I should continue
the sessions with the shrink.

503
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:23,731
Maybe Jeb's right...
just put a lid on the past.

504
00:37:23,808 --> 00:37:26,777
But what you said
about the accident...

505
00:37:26,844 --> 00:37:28,436
I can't let it go.

506
00:37:28,512 --> 00:37:31,276
It doesn't add up.

507
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:33,283
I feel there's...

508
00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:35,114
something wrong here.

509
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:37,211
Trust your feelings.

510
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:39,222
What?

511
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:41,053
Do you love Judith?

512
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,133
I guess I do.

513
00:37:51,202 --> 00:37:52,669
She's sick.

514
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:56,373
You do know that, don't you?

515
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,807
She's the one who needs
a psychiatrist, not you.

516
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:04,246
She's a pathological liar.

517
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:08,149
She lies for the sake of lying.

518
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:09,481
In seven years...

519
00:38:09,553 --> 00:38:12,579
she's never told me
the simple truth about anything.

520
00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:16,093
God, Dan,
it used to drive you crazy...

521
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,754
especially when
you'd catch her in it...

522
00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:23,596
and she'd just coolly
start spinning another one.

523
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:26,603
She thinks everybody's stupid.

524
00:38:26,671 --> 00:38:30,437
She can do anything
and get away with it.

525
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:31,998
She's sick.

526
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:40,309
What happened in Mexico
with Stanton?

527
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:43,285
She's like a drug addict...

528
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:45,322
completely hooked on him.

529
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:49,952
And he's still around...

530
00:38:50,027 --> 00:38:51,961
believe me.

531
00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:54,156
Problem is, so are you.

532
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:59,294
Dan, do you know
how much you're worth?

533
00:39:14,418 --> 00:39:17,319
You can't really see
how beautiful it is...

534
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:18,855
with the lights on.

535
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:26,887
Isn't that amazing?

536
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:34,764
If only life could be
that perfect...

537
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:36,534
that still.

538
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:48,978
Oh, Dan...

539
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:51,544
Danny...

540
00:39:54,859 --> 00:39:56,019
Oh, Jenny, no.

541
00:39:56,093 --> 00:39:57,617
Don't. Don't do this.

542
00:39:57,695 --> 00:39:59,663
We were lovers, Dan.

543
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,868
The Hacienda?

544
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:13,637
You remember.

545
00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:15,679
We were gonna get married.

546
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:20,012
We were just waiting
for the right time.

547
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:22,644
Jeb's not back till tomorrow.

548
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,654
Make love to me now...

549
00:40:24,722 --> 00:40:25,814
here...

550
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:28,085
just like we used to.

551
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:32,493
I said... I said stop it.

552
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:35,464
I don't remember.

553
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:37,023
Can't you understand?

554
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:40,236
Get out.

555
00:40:40,304 --> 00:40:42,067
Jenny, please...

556
00:40:42,139 --> 00:40:43,367
Get out!

557
00:41:05,696 --> 00:41:06,628
Hi, Jeb.

558
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:08,597
Oh, Dan.

559
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:11,634
Copying my homework?

560
00:41:11,702 --> 00:41:14,899
No, no. Just taking a look...

561
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:16,997
at what you've been doing
while I've been gone...

562
00:41:17,074 --> 00:41:19,235
and it looks pretty good,
considering...

563
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:20,607
Yes?

564
00:41:20,678 --> 00:41:23,408
Considering you have no idea
of what the fuck you're doing.

565
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,449
Listen...

566
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:28,280
I'm just not so sure...

567
00:41:28,352 --> 00:41:29,944
That I can handle it?

568
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,147
No, I just think we have
some serious thinking to do...

569
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:34,157
about what the next step is.

570
00:41:34,225 --> 00:41:35,886
That's precisely
what I've been doing...

571
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:40,329
the last couple of days,
thinking about that.

572
00:41:40,397 --> 00:41:41,830
So...

573
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:47,300
if you're ready
to buy out your partner...

574
00:41:47,371 --> 00:41:50,033
then he's ready to sell.

575
00:41:50,107 --> 00:41:53,702
Assuming we could
come up with a deal.

576
00:41:53,777 --> 00:41:56,245
I warn you, pal...

577
00:41:58,249 --> 00:41:59,841
I'll suck your blood.

578
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:04,115
Well, like you say, Jeb...
in an unreliable world...

579
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:06,383
it's nice to have somebody
who's consistent.

580
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:07,446
Jeb?

581
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:10,153
The men from the security
service are here.

582
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:13,497
Some Greenpeace freaks
are trying to stop us...

583
00:42:13,564 --> 00:42:16,055
from shifting an old boat
off the marina site.

584
00:42:16,133 --> 00:42:17,896
Time to go knock
a few heads together.

585
00:42:17,968 --> 00:42:19,196
We'll talk.

586
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:22,363
I'm really sorry, Dan.

587
00:42:22,439 --> 00:42:24,805
It's just that Jeb insisted,
and there was really nothing...

588
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:26,069
No sweat.

589
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,643
What do you want?

590
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:33,046
Caffeine and no calls.

591
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:34,550
Wait a minute,
you can't just come...

592
00:42:34,618 --> 00:42:36,176
Nancy, it's OK.

593
00:42:38,122 --> 00:42:40,056
I guess I owe you an apology.

594
00:42:40,124 --> 00:42:41,421
Oh, forget it.

595
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:43,585
Maybe I was wrong.
Maybe you was right.

596
00:42:43,661 --> 00:42:44,923
Oh, that's refreshing.

597
00:42:44,995 --> 00:42:47,930
After you left the store
the other night...

598
00:42:47,998 --> 00:42:50,933
I gave the whole business
another thought...

599
00:42:51,001 --> 00:42:55,495
and the more I ran it by,
the more I began figuring...

600
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:58,167
maybe you wasn't
so far off base.

601
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:00,107
You're a day late
and a few dollars short...

602
00:43:00,177 --> 00:43:02,372
Mr. Klein.

603
00:43:02,446 --> 00:43:03,845
You were right...

604
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:05,211
Forget the guy.

605
00:43:05,282 --> 00:43:09,378
Oh, boy... am I in a fix.

606
00:43:12,156 --> 00:43:13,589
What is the problem?

607
00:43:13,657 --> 00:43:14,919
The guy!

608
00:43:14,992 --> 00:43:20,225
Look, I did a bit
of research on him.

609
00:43:20,297 --> 00:43:22,288
Let's start with the accident.

610
00:43:22,366 --> 00:43:23,594
Yeah?

611
00:43:23,667 --> 00:43:26,602
Now, you was driving
your car, right?

612
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:28,570
- Right.
- Wrong.

613
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:31,472
I checked with the hospital.
There's no way...

614
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:34,841
that you could have received
these head injuries...

615
00:43:34,912 --> 00:43:37,608
if you were sitting behind
the wheel of a car.

616
00:43:37,681 --> 00:43:39,376
Next question...

617
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:42,942
Was your wife even in the car
when it went over the edge...

618
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:44,988
or could she have been
on terra firma...

619
00:43:45,055 --> 00:43:46,784
and given it a little nudge?

620
00:43:46,857 --> 00:43:49,951
Come on, Klein.
She's not Superman.

621
00:43:50,027 --> 00:43:52,552
Yeah, but how about
her and Stanton?

622
00:43:58,669 --> 00:44:01,069
How would you like your coffee?

623
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:02,696
Oh. Two sugars...

624
00:44:02,773 --> 00:44:03,740
real sugar.

625
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:06,935
And cream,
preferably from a cow.

626
00:44:07,011 --> 00:44:08,410
Oh, by the way...

627
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,913
the typeface on your IBM...

628
00:44:11,015 --> 00:44:13,279
it wouldn't happen to be
Prestige Elite...

629
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:15,147
by any chance, would it?

630
00:44:15,219 --> 00:44:17,278
Everybody's into
Courier 10 these days...

631
00:44:17,354 --> 00:44:19,288
but I still use...

632
00:44:19,356 --> 00:44:20,789
How'd you know that?

633
00:44:20,858 --> 00:44:23,793
You got Prestige Elite
written all over you.

634
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:33,359
I tracked Stanton down
to the architect firm...

635
00:44:33,437 --> 00:44:35,803
he used to work for in L.A.

636
00:44:35,873 --> 00:44:39,775
They don't know where he is,
but I do.

637
00:44:39,877 --> 00:44:42,812
At least, I know where he was.

638
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,815
Right here in this office...

639
00:44:45,883 --> 00:44:50,616
exactly 51/2 hours
after the accident.

640
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:58,487
A copy of a fax
he sent to his boss.

641
00:44:58,562 --> 00:44:59,824
"Dear Paul...

642
00:44:59,897 --> 00:45:02,422
"I've finally decided
to take the plunge...

643
00:45:02,499 --> 00:45:06,060
"and go for that job in Tokyo.

644
00:45:06,136 --> 00:45:07,763
"I'm shipping out tonight...

645
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:11,205
"so don't expect
to hear from me for a while.

646
00:45:11,275 --> 00:45:12,503
"Happy New Year."

647
00:45:12,576 --> 00:45:17,479
Sent from...
"Merrick/Scott No.04."

648
00:45:17,581 --> 00:45:22,541
That's your personal
fax machine... number 4.

649
00:45:25,689 --> 00:45:27,281
Time sent...

650
00:45:27,357 --> 00:45:29,291
8:04 A. M...

651
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:31,293
January 1.

652
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:37,159
Typeface... Prestige Elite.

653
00:45:47,177 --> 00:45:49,236
I take it your wife...

654
00:45:49,313 --> 00:45:51,110
had a set of keys
to this office, huh?

655
00:45:51,181 --> 00:45:53,206
But she was in a hospital,
for Christ's sake!

656
00:45:53,283 --> 00:45:54,910
No, she was not.

657
00:46:00,324 --> 00:46:02,690
Judith Merrick
discharged herself...

658
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:07,163
from Marin County Hospital
at 6:18 A. M...

659
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:09,926
January 1...

660
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,059
31/2 hours after
she was admitted.

661
00:46:13,203 --> 00:46:14,261
No.

662
00:46:14,338 --> 00:46:15,771
It gets worse.

663
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:17,773
Japanese immigration
has got no record...

664
00:46:17,841 --> 00:46:20,571
of a Jack Stanton
entering Japan.

665
00:46:20,644 --> 00:46:22,544
OK, he could be anywhere...

666
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:24,478
but I'll bet you
dollars to doughnuts...

667
00:46:24,548 --> 00:46:26,607
the boy never left town.

668
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:31,617
You're worth an awful lot
of money, Mr. Merrick.

669
00:46:31,688 --> 00:46:34,623
They tried to kill you once.

670
00:46:34,691 --> 00:46:36,989
Why not try it again, huh?

671
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:56,471
Dan?

672
00:47:57,541 --> 00:48:00,442
Mr. Merrick's taking a nap.

673
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:02,637
Any calls, Lydia?

674
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,112
Yeah, just one.

675
00:48:04,181 --> 00:48:06,308
Said they'd call back later.

676
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:08,578
Stan someone.

677
00:48:08,652 --> 00:48:09,744
Let's see...

678
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:10,980
Jack Stanton.

679
00:48:14,992 --> 00:48:16,425
Did he...

680
00:48:16,493 --> 00:48:17,721
leave a number?

681
00:48:17,794 --> 00:48:20,524
No. Just that he's in town.

682
00:48:26,536 --> 00:48:27,662
Mrs. Merrick?

683
00:48:29,172 --> 00:48:30,434
Are you all right?

684
00:48:30,507 --> 00:48:31,940
Yes, Lydia.

685
00:48:32,009 --> 00:48:33,033
I'm fine.

686
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:34,975
May I speak
to Gus Klein, please?

687
00:48:35,045 --> 00:48:36,478
Nah, he's delivering puppies.

688
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:37,706
When will he be back?

689
00:48:37,781 --> 00:48:38,839
He's right here.

690
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:40,247
Let me talk to him.

691
00:48:40,317 --> 00:48:43,184
I told you,
he's delivering puppies!

692
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:44,652
God damn it,
this is important.

693
00:48:44,721 --> 00:48:47,986
Tell him Jack Stanton's in town,
he called my wife, and...

694
00:48:48,058 --> 00:48:50,083
Did you get all that?

695
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,151
Yeah. The bitch just got him.

696
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:53,354
What?

697
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:54,897
The dog just bit Gus.

698
00:48:54,998 --> 00:48:56,932
Yeah, yeah, I'll tell him.

699
00:49:03,373 --> 00:49:06,570
Lydia, can I borrow your car
for a little while?

700
00:49:06,643 --> 00:49:08,270
My battery's dead.

701
00:49:08,345 --> 00:49:11,280
Sure, Mr. Merrick.
The keys are under the seat.

702
00:54:56,693 --> 00:54:58,126
Merrick residence?

703
00:54:58,228 --> 00:54:59,957
Hi, this is Laura
at Demo's Pharmacy.

704
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:01,964
Just wanted to let you know that
Mr. Merrick's prescription...

705
00:55:02,032 --> 00:55:03,294
is ready to be picked up.

706
00:55:03,366 --> 00:55:04,833
That's not for us, Twigs.

707
00:55:04,934 --> 00:55:07,164
Patience, honey. Patience.

708
00:55:09,272 --> 00:55:12,207
Can't keep Firemouth
with Green Terror...

709
00:55:12,275 --> 00:55:14,038
when they're spawning.

710
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:19,471
The rival females
try to kill each other.

711
00:55:19,582 --> 00:55:21,573
Oh, yeah...

712
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:26,785
I did a little checking
on that old shipwreck.

713
00:55:26,856 --> 00:55:29,086
Interesting.

714
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:32,856
It seems you guys are gonna have
quite a battle to get rid of it.

715
00:55:32,929 --> 00:55:36,262
Yeah. So, did you get
any phone calls?

716
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:38,665
Sure. I had a great morning.

717
00:55:38,735 --> 00:55:42,262
I reread all of "Animal Farm."

718
00:55:44,274 --> 00:55:46,538
Did you ever read "Animal Farm,"
Mr. Merrick?

719
00:55:46,609 --> 00:55:48,975
Yeah, sure. George Orwell.

720
00:55:49,045 --> 00:55:51,639
Mr. Orwell's simple tale
of animals rising up...

721
00:55:51,748 --> 00:55:53,306
against their human oppressors.

722
00:55:53,416 --> 00:55:56,613
Boy, would I sing
to see that really happen.

723
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:58,278
Take your ship, for instance.

724
00:55:58,388 --> 00:56:00,618
Do know what your guys
are gonna do with it?

725
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:03,056
They're gonna tow it
a mile out of U.S. waters...

726
00:56:03,126 --> 00:56:05,594
and sink the sucker!

727
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:07,390
The fact that it's full
of toxic waste...

728
00:56:07,464 --> 00:56:11,366
doesn't seem to bother anybody,
except, of course, the fish.

729
00:56:11,468 --> 00:56:15,165
But fish don't buy condos,
so who gives a shit?

730
00:56:15,238 --> 00:56:16,500
Hello?

731
00:56:16,573 --> 00:56:18,939
Is this Judith Merrick
of 114 Summit Way?

732
00:56:19,008 --> 00:56:20,066
Yes.

733
00:56:20,176 --> 00:56:22,872
This is Western Union
in San Rafael.

734
00:56:22,946 --> 00:56:25,744
We have a telegram for you
from a Jack Stanton.

735
00:56:25,815 --> 00:56:27,339
Do you want me to read it,
or should l...

736
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:29,315
Yes, read it.

737
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:31,149
"Unable to reach you
on the phone...

738
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:32,483
"without interference.

739
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:34,420
"lmperative I see you today.

740
00:56:34,491 --> 00:56:35,822
"Send telegram...

741
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:38,588
"care of General Delivery,
San Francisco."

742
00:56:38,661 --> 00:56:40,458
Signed, "Jack."

743
00:56:41,765 --> 00:56:42,732
Dan.

744
00:56:46,836 --> 00:56:47,768
Jenny.

745
00:56:47,837 --> 00:56:49,065
I have to talk to you.

746
00:56:49,139 --> 00:56:51,073
There's something
I have to find out.

747
00:56:51,141 --> 00:56:52,199
Is Stanton in town?

748
00:56:52,308 --> 00:56:55,004
Yeah. He's been trying
to reach Judith.

749
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:56,170
I knew it.

750
00:56:56,279 --> 00:56:58,372
Judith came over to see me
on some pretext...

751
00:56:58,481 --> 00:57:00,574
or rather, doing her
"best friend" routine.

752
00:57:00,683 --> 00:57:03,311
She's trying to find out
how much I know.

753
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:05,888
She's ready
to make her move, Dan.

754
00:57:05,989 --> 00:57:09,857
She's got you right where
she wants you, like a child...

755
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:12,690
no memory, no history.

756
00:57:14,964 --> 00:57:17,762
Why...

757
00:57:17,834 --> 00:57:20,530
Jenny, please.

758
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:23,504
My God, this is so crazy.

759
00:57:26,342 --> 00:57:29,607
Well, she won't
get away with it.

760
00:57:36,653 --> 00:57:39,213
- Oh, jeez.
- Did you get my fax from L. A?

761
00:57:39,322 --> 00:57:40,755
Oh, yeah.

762
00:57:40,824 --> 00:57:43,190
Listen, tomorrow night,
soon as I get back into town...

763
00:57:43,259 --> 00:57:45,124
we sit down, dinner,
we hammer out a deal.

764
00:57:45,195 --> 00:57:47,220
OK, but what are we doing
with this shipwreck?

765
00:57:47,330 --> 00:57:50,299
Done! We dump it tomorrow.

766
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,595
Oh, do me a favor.

767
00:57:52,669 --> 00:57:55,729
Keep your hands off
the office machines, huh?

768
00:57:57,307 --> 00:58:01,073
Dan, it's Mr. Klein on line 2.

769
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:03,135
Hello?

770
00:58:03,246 --> 00:58:05,680
Hello, Mr. Merrick?
It's Gus Klein.

771
00:58:05,782 --> 00:58:07,545
Be outside in two minutes.

772
00:58:07,617 --> 00:58:09,141
Get ready for some action.

773
00:58:09,252 --> 00:58:10,549
Why? What happened?

774
00:58:16,759 --> 00:58:18,818
Aw... sorry.

775
00:58:18,928 --> 00:58:21,761
Nancy, do me a favor
and get a hold of...

776
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:23,890
what's-his-name
down in site clearance?

777
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,592
- Abe?
- Abe, yeah.

778
00:58:25,702 --> 00:58:27,567
Give him a call and tell him...

779
00:58:27,637 --> 00:58:30,765
to hold off moving
that old shipwreck tomorrow.

780
00:58:35,311 --> 00:58:36,676
You drive. I got to work.

781
00:58:36,746 --> 00:58:37,735
What's up?

782
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:39,678
This. Come on.

783
00:58:39,749 --> 00:58:41,842
Let's get this machine
on the road.

784
00:58:46,055 --> 00:58:47,818
Golden Gate.

785
00:58:55,899 --> 00:58:57,867
Jack Stanton...

786
00:58:57,967 --> 00:58:59,400
care of General Delivery...

787
00:58:59,502 --> 00:59:00,901
San Francisco.

788
00:59:01,004 --> 00:59:02,596
And the message?

789
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:03,672
"Dear Jack...

790
00:59:03,773 --> 00:59:07,038
"I was surprised
to hear from you.

791
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:09,169
"If you're in some kind
of trouble...

792
00:59:09,279 --> 00:59:11,372
"I'll try and help.

793
00:59:11,481 --> 00:59:13,949
"But please understand...

794
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:19,386
"my husband and I

796
00:59:22,759 --> 00:59:24,693
"at our hotel."

797
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:28,364
"At our hotel..."

798
00:59:28,464 --> 00:59:30,762
The Hacienda, right?

799
00:59:48,284 --> 00:59:50,514
My guess is,
whatever they're up to...

800
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:52,212
they're up to in the bedroom.

801
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:59,321
I'll follow them
and plant this outside...

802
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:02,728
so we can monitor them
from the car.

803
01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:04,699
Hey.

804
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:23,051
What the fuck am I doing?

805
01:00:23,152 --> 01:00:25,347
I'm looking through a lens.

806
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:38,593
OK, so now where's Romeo?

807
01:00:38,701 --> 01:00:42,933
That's what he looked like
nine months ago.

808
01:00:43,039 --> 01:00:44,438
Same location.

809
01:00:44,507 --> 01:00:45,974
The same lens.

810
01:00:46,075 --> 01:00:47,542
Great.

811
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:55,348
Hey...

812
01:01:08,865 --> 01:01:11,925
I was there, too, Dan.

813
01:01:12,035 --> 01:01:13,935
A long time ago.

814
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:18,873
You were married?

815
01:01:18,941 --> 01:01:20,033
Yeah.

816
01:01:21,611 --> 01:01:23,841
Yeah, right.

817
01:01:23,946 --> 01:01:28,883
When it ended,
I was walking around...

818
01:01:28,985 --> 01:01:32,318
feeling like I was a package
of broken glass.

819
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:44,926
Nice car.

820
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:47,662
Yeah, yeah.

821
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:50,136
1968 Dodge Coronet.

822
01:01:50,206 --> 01:01:53,698
212-thousand miles.

823
01:01:53,810 --> 01:01:55,573
Its original engine.

824
01:02:09,459 --> 01:02:11,950
All right.

825
01:02:13,763 --> 01:02:16,323
Yep, that's our boy.

826
01:02:16,432 --> 01:02:20,459
OK, you stay here.

827
01:02:36,486 --> 01:02:38,249
He's coming back out.

828
01:02:44,494 --> 01:02:45,426
Start her up, Dan.

829
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:50,296
Roll it.

830
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:03,604
You gonna open it?

831
01:04:03,706 --> 01:04:06,266
Not unless you got the key...
it's padlocked.

832
01:04:06,375 --> 01:04:08,309
Well, how the hell
did he get through?

833
01:04:08,411 --> 01:04:09,537
I don't know.

834
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:18,414
You OK?

835
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:20,614
Look what that son of a bitch
has done to my car!

836
01:04:30,633 --> 01:04:32,999
Hey...

837
01:04:35,438 --> 01:04:37,167
Take it easy!

838
01:04:37,273 --> 01:04:38,535
This car's an antique!

839
01:04:38,641 --> 01:04:40,302
You're telling me...
it drives like one!

840
01:05:05,234 --> 01:05:06,223
Jesus!

841
01:05:12,808 --> 01:05:14,400
You're gonna break her
to pieces!

842
01:05:22,952 --> 01:05:25,682
Oh, no! Slow down, will you?

843
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:49,407
Well, get out of his way!

844
01:05:51,347 --> 01:05:54,180
OK, you bastard,
you want it, you'll get it!

845
01:05:55,384 --> 01:05:56,715
For Christ's sake, Dan!

846
01:05:56,819 --> 01:05:58,150
Aw, fuck him!

847
01:05:59,855 --> 01:06:01,220
Oh, my God, we're done!

848
01:06:17,239 --> 01:06:19,104
Oh, look.

849
01:06:19,208 --> 01:06:20,800
Look at this.

850
01:06:29,018 --> 01:06:30,451
Oh, shit.

851
01:06:32,421 --> 01:06:33,945
I'm sorry.

852
01:06:42,431 --> 01:06:44,797
Hey, I'm really sorry, Gus.

853
01:06:47,436 --> 01:06:49,495
I'll make it up to you.

854
01:06:54,944 --> 01:06:56,878
Time for the cops, huh?

855
01:06:58,881 --> 01:07:00,007
Yeah.

856
01:07:01,550 --> 01:07:04,018
But first I want to talk
to Judith on my own.

857
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:05,280
You understand.

858
01:07:05,388 --> 01:07:06,821
I just hope she does.

859
01:07:06,889 --> 01:07:09,915
No, no,
I'm not talking revenge.

860
01:07:10,026 --> 01:07:14,190
I'm talking about the woman
who nursed me back to health.

861
01:07:14,296 --> 01:07:16,924
I just don't understand...

862
01:07:19,668 --> 01:07:21,499
I don't know...

863
01:07:21,604 --> 01:07:22,832
why.

864
01:07:24,774 --> 01:07:27,299
Spare yourself the pain.

865
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:32,905
I spent years trying
to figure out what went wrong.

866
01:07:33,015 --> 01:07:35,176
Got me nowhere.

867
01:07:39,588 --> 01:07:42,751
I still need
to talk to her, Gus.

868
01:07:42,858 --> 01:07:44,120
Yeah...

869
01:07:45,795 --> 01:07:47,387
Just in case.

870
01:10:09,972 --> 01:10:11,234
Freeze.

871
01:10:15,110 --> 01:10:17,101
Don't move.

872
01:10:28,357 --> 01:10:30,222
Jesus.

873
01:10:30,292 --> 01:10:32,988
There is no Stanton.

874
01:10:36,599 --> 01:10:38,066
You shot him.

875
01:10:38,133 --> 01:10:41,694
You were drunk, Dan.

876
01:10:41,804 --> 01:10:44,932
At the Scotts' party,
we had a fight.

877
01:10:45,007 --> 01:10:47,134
I made you take me home.

878
01:10:47,209 --> 01:10:49,404
Then you went really crazy.

879
01:10:49,478 --> 01:10:52,504
I ran upstairs
and locked myself in...

880
01:10:52,615 --> 01:10:56,107
and called Stanton for help.

881
01:10:56,185 --> 01:11:00,178
He came over, and you...

882
01:11:02,391 --> 01:11:04,655
we got rid of the body.

883
01:11:04,727 --> 01:11:07,423
Then we had the accident.

884
01:11:07,496 --> 01:11:10,329
No, I don't believe it.

885
01:11:10,399 --> 01:11:12,390
Dan, I tried
to keep it from you...

886
01:11:12,468 --> 01:11:14,834
but you hired
that damn detective again!

887
01:11:14,903 --> 01:11:16,336
I had to play Stanton...

888
01:11:16,405 --> 01:11:18,396
to convince him
that Stanton's still alive.

889
01:11:18,474 --> 01:11:20,704
You tried to kill me today!

890
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:25,672
The shots I fired at you two
were only meant to scare you.

891
01:11:25,748 --> 01:11:28,512
Don't you see? We had
to get Klein off the trail.

892
01:11:28,584 --> 01:11:30,347
What, am I going crazy here?

893
01:11:30,419 --> 01:11:32,944
I saw both of you
go in that hotel.

894
01:11:33,022 --> 01:11:34,455
You saw me go in.

895
01:11:34,523 --> 01:11:37,287
I got changed, and then
I went out the back door...

896
01:11:37,359 --> 01:11:38,883
where I had the Porsche parked.

897
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:42,920
You dressed up like Stanton,
and you almost killed me.

898
01:11:42,998 --> 01:11:46,365
Now you're telling me
that I killed Stanton.

899
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:51,865
Wait a minute.

900
01:11:51,940 --> 01:11:55,034
"Before the accident."
That's what you said?

901
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:58,637
Yeah.

902
01:11:58,714 --> 01:12:00,409
You fucking liar!

903
01:12:00,482 --> 01:12:02,916
Jack Stanton was alive and well
and in my office...

904
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:05,385
sending a fax
five hours after the accident!

905
01:12:05,454 --> 01:12:08,218
That was me! I sent the fax...

906
01:12:08,290 --> 01:12:10,815
to make believe
Stanton was still alive.

907
01:12:10,893 --> 01:12:15,159
Why did you think I checked out
of the hospital so goddamn fast?

908
01:12:15,230 --> 01:12:17,061
To start covering for you.

909
01:12:17,132 --> 01:12:19,362
The first morning...

910
01:12:19,435 --> 01:12:21,528
paying Stanton's bill
at the Hacienda...

911
01:12:21,603 --> 01:12:23,036
sending the fax...

912
01:12:23,105 --> 01:12:25,938
hiding his Porsche
in the garage...

913
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:32,178
and not knowing
if you were dead or alive...

914
01:12:32,247 --> 01:12:34,613
but praying and, God,
working...

915
01:12:34,683 --> 01:12:37,174
to protect you
if you were alive.

916
01:12:38,454 --> 01:12:41,582
I love you, Dan.

917
01:12:41,657 --> 01:12:44,558
Haven't you learned
that much by now?

918
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:50,992
There's nothing
I wouldn't do for you.

919
01:12:52,868 --> 01:12:54,597
Nothing.

920
01:12:54,670 --> 01:12:57,662
But then
you brought back Klein.

921
01:12:59,908 --> 01:13:01,603
Don't you see?

922
01:13:01,677 --> 01:13:06,637
You hired someone to find out
that you're a murderer.

923
01:13:06,715 --> 01:13:10,708
You hired somebody to send you
to the gas chamber.

924
01:13:17,426 --> 01:13:19,360
Why...

925
01:13:19,428 --> 01:13:22,363
why didn't you tell me
any of this before?

926
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:23,728
In the hospital?

927
01:13:23,799 --> 01:13:25,664
"Hi, Dan,
I brought you some roses.

928
01:13:25,734 --> 01:13:27,497
"Oh, and by the way,
you're a murderer."

929
01:13:30,139 --> 01:13:33,905
Dan, I was trying
to protect you...

930
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:38,847
to protect you
from your own memory.

931
01:13:38,914 --> 01:13:42,543
I wanted a new start,
for both of us.

932
01:13:43,852 --> 01:13:46,116
I wish to God
I'd died in that accident.

933
01:13:46,188 --> 01:13:48,782
Oh, don't say that.

934
01:13:48,857 --> 01:13:51,052
We're in this together.

935
01:13:53,862 --> 01:13:57,821
We have to get
out of here... tonight.

936
01:13:59,401 --> 01:14:02,097
Somebody out there
knows that Stanton's dead.

937
01:14:02,171 --> 01:14:04,196
The phone call,
the first telegram...

938
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:06,207
that wasn't me.
That was somebody else.

939
01:14:06,275 --> 01:14:08,641
- Somebody who...
- Who?

940
01:14:12,381 --> 01:14:14,815
I don't know.

941
01:14:14,883 --> 01:14:16,817
But whoever it is...

942
01:14:16,885 --> 01:14:20,321
they're trying to play
a rotten game with us.

943
01:14:20,389 --> 01:14:22,983
Oh, I started to panic.

944
01:14:23,058 --> 01:14:26,323
I went down to the wreck
where you...

945
01:14:26,395 --> 01:14:28,863
Well, there's
not much left now.

946
01:14:30,232 --> 01:14:31,859
Only...

947
01:14:33,902 --> 01:14:35,335
Oh, thank God...

948
01:14:35,404 --> 01:14:39,670
tomorrow they're finally dumping
that wreck and what's in it.

949
01:14:39,741 --> 01:14:41,174
Judith...

950
01:14:43,245 --> 01:14:46,806
I put a hold on that ship.
I told them not to move it.

951
01:14:49,051 --> 01:14:52,043
How the hell was I supposed
to know what was in it?

952
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:54,088
Jesus Christ!

953
01:14:58,861 --> 01:15:02,297
OK, we have to move now.

954
01:15:02,364 --> 01:15:04,525
You throw whatever we need
into a suitcase.

955
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:07,125
We can arrange for money to be
sent to us when we get there.

956
01:15:07,202 --> 01:15:09,534
I'll get the Porsche back to the
garage and pick up the Mercedes.

957
01:15:09,605 --> 01:15:11,800
- No, I'm coming with you.
- Dan, we don't have time.

958
01:15:11,874 --> 01:15:14,172
When I get back,
we have to be ready to leave.

959
01:15:14,243 --> 01:15:16,302
You do the packing
and write a note to Lydia.

960
01:15:16,378 --> 01:15:18,278
It can't look
as if we're running.

961
01:16:35,057 --> 01:16:37,321
This is Jenny.
I want you to come over.

962
01:16:37,392 --> 01:16:39,326
There's something
you have to know.

963
01:16:39,394 --> 01:16:41,328
I can't tell you
over the phone.

964
01:16:41,396 --> 01:16:43,227
It has to be one on one.

965
01:16:43,298 --> 01:16:44,595
- I can't.
Listen...

966
01:16:44,666 --> 01:16:47,260
if you don't come over
right now...

967
01:16:47,336 --> 01:16:49,304
I'm calling the police.

968
01:16:56,311 --> 01:16:57,801
Jenny!

969
01:17:00,849 --> 01:17:03,682
Jenny, it's me, Dan!

970
01:17:03,752 --> 01:17:05,879
Jenny,
open the goddamn door!

971
01:17:23,372 --> 01:17:24,669
Hey.

972
01:17:39,855 --> 01:17:43,484
I got a call from Jenny.

973
01:17:43,558 --> 01:17:46,118
She told me to come over.

974
01:17:46,194 --> 01:17:48,253
I found her like this.

975
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:51,959
Yeah, I monitored the call.

976
01:18:04,346 --> 01:18:05,779
Sit down.

977
01:18:05,847 --> 01:18:07,815
You're not going anywhere.

978
01:18:09,251 --> 01:18:11,913
I had a little talk...

979
01:18:11,987 --> 01:18:15,354
with the valet parking man
at the Hacienda.

980
01:18:16,858 --> 01:18:20,794
He told me...
the guy in the Porsche...

981
01:18:20,862 --> 01:18:22,830
wasn't a guy at all.

982
01:18:29,871 --> 01:18:31,498
What do you mean?

983
01:18:33,075 --> 01:18:35,737
Where is she?

984
01:18:35,811 --> 01:18:37,005
Who?

985
01:18:37,079 --> 01:18:38,808
Oh, come on.

986
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:41,314
I don't know. She left.

987
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:43,248
Right.

988
01:18:43,385 --> 01:18:45,250
In Stanton's Porsche.

989
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:47,788
I was watching.

990
01:18:50,325 --> 01:18:52,418
So where does that leave
Mr. Stanton?

991
01:18:52,494 --> 01:18:56,260
How the hell should I know?
Your guess is as good as mine.

992
01:18:56,331 --> 01:18:58,595
Really?

993
01:18:58,667 --> 01:19:00,134
Well...

994
01:19:01,503 --> 01:19:04,404
for what it's worth...

995
01:19:04,473 --> 01:19:06,566
my guess is...

996
01:19:06,641 --> 01:19:09,269
whatever's left of him...

997
01:19:09,344 --> 01:19:12,279
is rotting
in that old shipwreck.

998
01:19:12,347 --> 01:19:14,281
You see, Mr. Merrick...

999
01:19:14,349 --> 01:19:17,375
my guess is
that you killed him...

1000
01:19:17,452 --> 01:19:19,420
the night
I sent you the pictures...

1001
01:19:19,488 --> 01:19:21,353
the night
you had the accident.

1002
01:19:21,423 --> 01:19:22,754
My guess is...

1003
01:19:22,824 --> 01:19:25,384
your wife's been covering up
for you all along.

1004
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:26,893
And my guess is...

1005
01:19:26,962 --> 01:19:29,396
Jenny Scott somehow
put the pieces together...

1006
01:19:29,464 --> 01:19:31,591
and was threatening
to go to the cops.

1007
01:19:31,666 --> 01:19:34,191
- I didn't kill Jenny.
- What about Stanton?

1008
01:19:34,269 --> 01:19:36,203
Maybe I did.
Maybe that's the block...

1009
01:19:36,271 --> 01:19:38,000
the doctors are talking about.

1010
01:19:38,073 --> 01:19:41,770
Maybe I'm a raving psychopath,
but I can't remember!

1011
01:19:41,843 --> 01:19:45,904
I can't turn
a blind eye to murder.

1012
01:19:45,981 --> 01:19:47,380
I'm not asking you to.

1013
01:19:47,449 --> 01:19:48,882
I'm just asking you
to give me a chance...

1014
01:19:48,950 --> 01:19:50,315
to let me remember
what happened.

1015
01:19:50,385 --> 01:19:51,750
Let me go inside
that ship... please.

1016
01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:54,584
- Sheriff's department?
- Give me Lieutenant Lacey.

1017
01:19:54,656 --> 01:19:56,647
Oh, for God's sake, Gus.

1018
01:19:56,725 --> 01:19:58,420
If I did it, I'll pay for it.

1019
01:19:58,493 --> 01:20:00,290
I'm not gonna run.
You can put me away.

1020
01:20:00,362 --> 01:20:02,227
Put me in a straitjacket,
the gas chamber...

1021
01:20:02,297 --> 01:20:03,924
but at least
give me a chance...

1022
01:20:03,999 --> 01:20:06,024
to remember what the fuck
it is I've done!

1023
01:20:06,101 --> 01:20:08,831
Yeah, this is Lacey.

1024
01:20:08,904 --> 01:20:13,170
Send a car to 1134
Lagunda Coast Highway.

1025
01:20:13,241 --> 01:20:14,265
Who is this?

1026
01:20:14,342 --> 01:20:15,502
There's been a murder.

1027
01:20:15,577 --> 01:20:16,942
Who's calling?

1028
01:20:17,012 --> 01:20:21,308
Hello?

1029
01:20:34,262 --> 01:20:35,422
Let's go.

1030
01:21:42,430 --> 01:21:43,829
Jesus!

1031
01:21:46,368 --> 01:21:48,836
We're gonna get a disease.

1032
01:21:56,945 --> 01:21:58,276
Come on.

1033
01:22:01,383 --> 01:22:02,350
Thanks.

1034
01:23:03,378 --> 01:23:04,902
Anything there?

1035
01:23:17,525 --> 01:23:18,856
It's Stanton.

1036
01:23:50,859 --> 01:23:52,793
It's me.

1037
01:23:52,861 --> 01:23:55,159
Dan Merrick.

1038
01:23:55,230 --> 01:23:56,424
It's Dan Merrick.

1039
01:24:02,203 --> 01:24:03,864
Oh, God!

1040
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:07,508
This is insane.

1041
01:24:09,744 --> 01:24:12,178
You must be...

1042
01:24:14,049 --> 01:24:15,141
Jack Stanton.

1043
01:24:42,410 --> 01:24:44,173
Jack Stanton.

1044
01:24:44,245 --> 01:24:45,678
I'm Jack Stanton.

1045
01:24:45,747 --> 01:24:47,772
What happened?

1046
01:24:47,849 --> 01:24:50,511
You must try
and remember what happened.

1047
01:24:50,585 --> 01:24:52,052
Don't back off.

1048
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:53,348
Come on. Come on.

1049
01:24:53,621 --> 01:24:55,555
What happened?

1050
01:24:55,623 --> 01:24:57,557
Try and remember.

1051
01:24:57,625 --> 01:25:00,025
Oh, Jack.

1052
01:25:00,095 --> 01:25:02,188
I love you.

1053
01:25:07,836 --> 01:25:09,326
I love you.

1054
01:25:14,876 --> 01:25:16,935
Who killed Dan Merrick?

1055
01:25:17,011 --> 01:25:19,377
You've got to remember.
Come on!

1056
01:25:19,447 --> 01:25:21,312
Who killed him?

1057
01:25:21,382 --> 01:25:23,850
She called me...

1058
01:25:23,918 --> 01:25:26,318
she called me
at the Hacienda.

1059
01:25:26,387 --> 01:25:28,821
For God's sake, Jack,
come quick.

1060
01:25:28,890 --> 01:25:30,323
Dan's crazy.

1061
01:25:30,391 --> 01:25:31,323
He's drunk.

1062
01:25:31,392 --> 01:25:32,825
Help me.

1063
01:25:32,894 --> 01:25:34,919
Jack, help me.

1064
01:25:34,996 --> 01:25:36,964
Help me.

1065
01:25:37,031 --> 01:25:38,658
Move it.

1066
01:25:38,733 --> 01:25:41,224
You must remember.

1067
01:25:41,302 --> 01:25:43,236
Who killed Dan Merrick?

1068
01:25:43,304 --> 01:25:45,169
Who killed him?

1069
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:47,674
I said open the door now!

1070
01:25:47,742 --> 01:25:49,676
- No!
- Judith!

1071
01:25:49,744 --> 01:25:52,212
No! Get out!

1072
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:53,474
You little whore.

1073
01:25:53,548 --> 01:25:56,073
You were fucking that bastard.

1074
01:25:56,151 --> 01:25:57,618
I love him!

1075
01:25:57,685 --> 01:26:00,176
You'll never see him again,
you little slut!

1076
01:26:02,857 --> 01:26:04,290
Get away from me.

1077
01:26:04,359 --> 01:26:06,293
I'm going to kill you!

1078
01:26:06,361 --> 01:26:07,623
Dan!

1079
01:26:07,695 --> 01:26:10,755
You're gonna pay
for what you've done to me!

1080
01:26:14,235 --> 01:26:15,600
Judith, don't!

1081
01:26:40,395 --> 01:26:42,329
Oh, God.

1082
01:26:43,698 --> 01:26:46,292
We gotta do something.

1083
01:26:46,367 --> 01:26:47,766
Call the police.

1084
01:26:47,835 --> 01:26:50,065
- Oh, no, Jack.
- Listen to me...

1085
01:26:50,138 --> 01:26:53,938
No, you got to help me, please.

1086
01:26:54,008 --> 01:26:57,000
They'll lock me up,
throw me in jail.

1087
01:26:57,078 --> 01:26:58,807
Without you, I'll die.

1088
01:27:00,081 --> 01:27:01,207
It was Judith.

1089
01:27:05,086 --> 01:27:06,451
Thank God.

1090
01:27:10,358 --> 01:27:13,293
You were right.
She was driving.

1091
01:27:13,361 --> 01:27:15,022
I'd been drinking that night.

1092
01:27:15,096 --> 01:27:17,792
I'd left my wallet
in the hotel.

1093
01:27:17,865 --> 01:27:19,230
She drove.

1094
01:27:33,881 --> 01:27:35,815
Whose idea was the ship?

1095
01:27:35,883 --> 01:27:38,818
Dan had told her about it.

1096
01:27:38,886 --> 01:27:42,185
She figured the chemicals
would dissolve the body.

1097
01:27:44,325 --> 01:27:45,792
Bad guess.

1098
01:27:46,828 --> 01:27:49,228
It's formaldehyde.

1099
01:27:49,297 --> 01:27:52,266
It's the best preservative
known to man.

1100
01:27:53,434 --> 01:27:56,335
Then the accident...

1101
01:27:56,404 --> 01:27:58,497
We head for Mexico now, tonight.

1102
01:27:58,573 --> 01:28:00,837
- Judith, what do you mean "we"?
- Of course we.

1103
01:28:00,908 --> 01:28:02,239
We're in this together.

1104
01:28:02,310 --> 01:28:04,835
We can't go loping off
into the sunset.

1105
01:28:04,912 --> 01:28:06,379
Now you listen to me.

1106
01:28:06,447 --> 01:28:08,608
I'm not going to spend
the rest of my life...

1107
01:28:08,683 --> 01:28:12,119
With me? Jack, you have to.
You're part of this now.

1108
01:28:12,186 --> 01:28:13,778
You planned it this way
from the beginning...

1109
01:28:13,855 --> 01:28:15,254
No, Jack, I didn't plan it...

1110
01:28:15,323 --> 01:28:18,019
but it happened.
Now you have no choice.

1111
01:28:18,092 --> 01:28:20,287
I do! I'll let the cops
sort this out.

1112
01:28:20,361 --> 01:28:21,851
- I'll take my chances.
- No!

1113
01:28:21,929 --> 01:28:24,591
I am out of your life.
Do you understand me?

1114
01:28:24,666 --> 01:28:26,725
Oh, Jack, don't say that.

1115
01:28:26,801 --> 01:28:28,564
You can't just
throw me away like that!

1116
01:28:28,636 --> 01:28:31,400
Jesus Christ, Judith!
What the fuck are you doing?

1117
01:28:48,823 --> 01:28:49,983
You OK?

1118
01:28:52,460 --> 01:28:55,793
I guess I gotta
call you Jack now, huh?

1119
01:28:55,863 --> 01:28:57,956
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

1120
01:29:09,043 --> 01:29:11,273
Gus!

1121
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:20,654
So now you know.

1122
01:29:20,722 --> 01:29:21,654
You're insane!

1123
01:29:21,723 --> 01:29:23,520
Gus!

1124
01:29:23,591 --> 01:29:26,116
- I had to do it.
- Gus!

1125
01:29:26,194 --> 01:29:27,855
He and Jenny
were the only ones who knew.

1126
01:29:29,897 --> 01:29:30,864
He's gone!

1127
01:29:30,932 --> 01:29:33,093
Oh! Gus!

1128
01:29:33,167 --> 01:29:34,327
Come with me.

1129
01:29:36,571 --> 01:29:38,038
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

1130
01:29:38,106 --> 01:29:40,267
We got to get him some help.

1131
01:29:45,313 --> 01:29:46,644
Judith, for Christ's sake!

1132
01:29:46,714 --> 01:29:48,807
He's dying down there.

1133
01:29:53,955 --> 01:29:56,014
I didn't want to hurt you.

1134
01:30:01,496 --> 01:30:03,123
Let's go, Jack.

1135
01:30:04,599 --> 01:30:07,227
It's a long ride.

1136
01:30:12,407 --> 01:30:14,807
Judith. Judith!

1137
01:30:14,876 --> 01:30:16,639
Jenny blew it.

1138
01:30:16,711 --> 01:30:18,406
She soon found out
you weren't Dan.

1139
01:30:18,479 --> 01:30:20,743
Your smell, your hands...

1140
01:30:20,815 --> 01:30:22,715
the lines on your palms.

1141
01:30:22,784 --> 01:30:24,877
She was going to the police.

1142
01:30:24,952 --> 01:30:27,318
I had to kill her.

1143
01:30:28,689 --> 01:30:30,520
After the accident...

1144
01:30:30,591 --> 01:30:32,388
when the doctors told me...

1145
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:34,758
"Your husband
is in a deep coma..."

1146
01:30:34,829 --> 01:30:36,729
I knew it was crazy...

1147
01:30:36,798 --> 01:30:39,266
but I really had no choice.

1148
01:30:40,601 --> 01:30:43,297
Oh, my God.

1149
01:30:43,371 --> 01:30:46,272
What I went through
to make all this come true.

1150
01:30:46,340 --> 01:30:48,672
When we first met...

1151
01:30:48,743 --> 01:30:51,735
it was as if
I'd always known you.

1152
01:30:51,813 --> 01:30:52,780
Remember?

1153
01:30:52,847 --> 01:30:54,075
Yes, I remember.

1154
01:30:57,919 --> 01:30:59,216
Don't!

1155
01:30:59,287 --> 01:31:01,118
This is the California
Highway Patrol.

1156
01:31:01,189 --> 01:31:02,554
Pull to the side...

1157
01:31:02,623 --> 01:31:04,523
OK, Judith,
it's all over now.

1158
01:31:04,592 --> 01:31:07,561
- Stop the car!
- Because of a gun?

1159
01:31:07,628 --> 01:31:09,858
Pull over to the shoulder!

1160
01:31:09,931 --> 01:31:11,421
I said stop the car!

1161
01:31:11,499 --> 01:31:13,865
Pull to the shoulder!
I repeat...

1162
01:31:13,935 --> 01:31:15,129
Forget Mexico.

1163
01:31:15,203 --> 01:31:17,068
I've got a better idea.

1164
01:31:57,645 --> 01:31:58,737
You all right?

1165
01:32:00,114 --> 01:32:01,342
Gus.

1166
01:32:02,750 --> 01:32:04,684
How the hell did you...

1167
01:32:04,752 --> 01:32:06,447
I got my own tank.

1168
01:32:07,822 --> 01:32:09,289
You want a shot?

1169
01:32:15,663 --> 01:32:17,790
You all right, Mr. Merrick?

1170
01:32:47,828 --> 01:32:50,058
Let's go, Dan.

1171
01:32:50,131 --> 01:32:51,598
Come on.
