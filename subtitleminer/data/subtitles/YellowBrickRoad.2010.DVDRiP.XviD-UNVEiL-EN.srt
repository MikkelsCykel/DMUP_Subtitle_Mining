YELLOWBRICKROAD (2010)

3
00:00:16,191 --> 00:00:19,040
<i> One morning in 1940,
ran the entire population of Friar ...</i>

4
00:00:19,041 --> 00:00:21,483
<i> north,
over a mountain trail in the wilderness. </i>

5
00:00:21,484 --> 00:00:24,432
<i> Most of them were frozen to death.
Some were brutally massacred. </i>

6
00:00:24,433 --> 00:00:26,931
<i>But most were
never recovered. </i>

7
00:00:26,932 --> 00:00:30,962
<i>In this confidential information
is a sound recording of a survivor ...</i>

8
00:00:30,963 --> 00:00:34,891
<i> performed prior
of this study. </i>

9
00:00:38,655 --> 00:00:40,550
<i>In office 8
reported at 11.00 </i>

10
00:00:40,551 --> 00:00:44,492
<i> on October 10, 1940. </i>

11
00:00:44,493 --> 00:00:48,710
<i> File: 63708NA90 </i>

12
00:00:48,889 --> 00:00:52,087
<i>Subject  is the last citizen,
and sole survivor of the missing. </i>

13
00:00:52,088 --> 00:00:54,604
<i> provided at 257. </i>

14
00:00:55,275 --> 00:01:00,560
<i> This case needs further study.
Gentlemen. Thank you. </i>

15
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:04,627
<i> Sir, how is it that you are the only
surviving are </i>

16
00:01:06,343 --> 00:01:10,005
<i>I walked  ...
- You're the only survivor. Why?</i>

17
00:01:11,374 --> 00:01:15,715
<i> "Everybody else dead ...
"I could not ...'</i>

18
00:01:18,515 --> 00:01:22,542
<i> "I left them behind ...
the path ...'</i>

19
00:01:22,547 --> 00:01:26,644
<i>Subject  holds his hands over his ears
and pain. Mr. ...</i>

20
00:01:27,686 --> 00:01:31,626
<i> What you heard?
- I heard ...</i>

21
00:01:31,943 --> 00:01:33,930
<i> What you heard, sir?
Mr. </i>

22
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:37,799
Do not you hear?
Do not you hear?

23
00:02:03,585 --> 00:02:05,544
Am I the only one here?

24
00:02:06,494 --> 00:02:09,058
<i> No sir, I'm here. </i>

25
00:02:11,456 --> 00:02:13,914
I'm not too late, right?
- About two minutes we close.

26
00:02:14,307 --> 00:02:15,436
Thank God.

27
00:02:15,678 --> 00:02:18,117
<i>You are here for Friar  New
Hampshire, the old way. </i>

28
00:02:18,886 --> 00:02:19,817
Yes.

29
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:23,013
<i>Two forms of
Photo identification, if you want. </i>

30
00:02:30,307 --> 00:02:34,564
<i> Mr. Barnes, you're asking,
There are certainly people ...</i>

31
00:02:34,565 --> 00:02:36,100
<i> who would rather not have. </i>

32
00:02:36,101 --> 00:02:37,131
I understand that.

33
00:02:37,345 --> 00:02:40,079
I have full confidence in
you that my collection of letters ...

34
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,916
will add to the gray
in the public domain.

35
00:02:42,949 --> 00:02:45,752
<i> You should be thinking more positive,
Mr. Barnes. </i>

36
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:52,029
<i> All for you The file,
photographs, and songs. </i>

37
00:02:53,887 --> 00:02:55,272
Oh, my God.
- In addition ...

38
00:02:55,601 --> 00:03:00,036
<i> I want to apologize for all these years
of discomfort with your wife and you </i>

39
00:03:01,452 --> 00:03:03,163
<i> Even if you do not really need. </i>

40
00:03:04,814 --> 00:03:06,592
But I do.

41
00:03:08,323 --> 00:03:10,914
<i> I will give you some photos, Mr. Barnes. </i>

42
00:03:16,088 --> 00:03:16,995
Excuse me ...

43
00:03:18,822 --> 00:03:20,379
Hello?

44
00:03:41,337 --> 00:03:42,492
We drink.

45
00:03:43,229 --> 00:03:44,672
You drink.

46
00:03:45,549 --> 00:03:47,704
You will now no classes, Teddy.
So drink.

47
00:03:47,856 --> 00:03:49,650
Pour into well but, Walter.

48
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:54,775
Besides, the general view is
if you can not do what you like ...

49
00:03:55,017 --> 00:03:57,019
you than resorting
to education.

50
00:03:58,476 --> 00:04:02,519
Except that I did not know where I was going,
that's what happened.

51
00:04:03,066 --> 00:04:04,538
And that's why we drink.

52
00:04:14,386 --> 00:04:16,763
I will really miss.

53
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:23,129
I do not know what to do.

54
00:04:32,437 --> 00:04:35,053
What if we look at drinking
we throw everything out the window?

55
00:04:36,154 --> 00:04:37,368
And work for what it is.

56
00:04:38,176 --> 00:04:40,094
The Walters is staying here.

57
00:04:41,131 --> 00:04:43,344
What if we do another book?

58
00:04:44,043 --> 00:04:46,022
He has it.
- No, he does not.

59
00:04:55,016 --> 00:04:56,711
In some ways it is real.

60
00:05:02,015 --> 00:05:04,295
<i> Mr. and Ms. Barnes, this is Jerry Abbott
from Hampshire. </i>

61
00:05:04,499 --> 00:05:06,863
<i>We just want to pass
that your request has been through. </i>

62
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:08,970
<i> I can not say that people here
there are very enthusiastic about. </i>

63
00:05:08,971 --> 00:05:12,493
<i>The Ranger will  arrangements.
He will no firearms with them. </i>

64
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,165
<i> And you better not. </i>

65
00:05:14,717 --> 00:05:16,240
<i> Good luck with the trip. </i>

66
00:05:16,965 --> 00:05:19,076
<i> Who the hell do you think you are? </i>

67
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:21,099
<i> Stay away </i>

68
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:25,066
<i> Do not come here.
We do not talk to you. </i>

69
00:05:25,237 --> 00:05:28,910
<i> We come here to help people
like you to avoid, transfer it. </i>

70
00:05:35,111 --> 00:05:36,593
Here you will be afraid of?

71
00:05:38,138 --> 00:05:39,265
In a good way.

72
00:05:40,928 --> 00:05:44,367
Would you be disappointed
if you go there and ...

73
00:05:45,388 --> 00:05:49,630
with a clear story
and pictures of a few bones?

74
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:55,518
Yes.
I was very disappointed.

75
00:05:56,201 --> 00:05:57,933
Just like me.

76
00:06:03,648 --> 00:06:05,298
I love you, Bellamy.

77
00:06:06,285 --> 00:06:07,966
I've already told you?

78
00:06:10,132 --> 00:06:11,789
I love you more.

79
00:06:28,826 --> 00:06:31,698
Well, day one: not very difficult.

80
00:06:32,531 --> 00:06:36,180
Today we pack up and leave.
We want at noon in the path.

81
00:06:36,622 --> 00:06:38,904
As many field studies
before dark.

82
00:06:38,938 --> 00:06:43,485
Why do not yet summer camp
and we do the consultation here.

83
00:06:44,635 --> 00:06:48,491
I'll go first. I'm Melissa Barnes
and do this regularly ...

84
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:50,465
and put the compass in the field.

85
00:06:50,466 --> 00:06:54,909
I'm Cy Banbridge, forest service,
They have asked me ...

86
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:57,328
but it seems unnecessary.

87
00:06:57,329 --> 00:07:01,851
Daryl Luger, I am reader.
- Luger Erin, we are readers.

88
00:07:02,565 --> 00:07:06,153
There are no new maps of the north
added since the turn of the century so ...

89
00:07:06,928 --> 00:07:09,163
So apparently we are lucky.

90
00:07:09,203 --> 00:07:10,546
Is that so, Cy.
- That's us.

91
00:07:10,547 --> 00:07:13,243
Michelle Bateman,
Teddy and Melissa's intern.

92
00:07:13,373 --> 00:07:17,550
Jill has the kit with them
so they can take care of the blisters.

93
00:07:17,734 --> 00:07:19,912
Trent and painkillers.

94
00:07:22,206 --> 00:07:24,538
Walter Myrick, I give behavioral psychology.

95
00:07:24,785 --> 00:07:28,453
I'll do some testing day
and captured with this camera.

96
00:07:28,868 --> 00:07:33,880
But you know, no stress,
Just as normal as possible.

97
00:07:35,432 --> 00:07:38,721
It's still early I know, but ...
I make enough.

98
00:07:40,068 --> 00:07:44,058
Teddy Barnes, co-author.
Photographer, that's clear.

99
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,654
The story of the Friar fascinates me.

100
00:07:49,931 --> 00:07:53,058
I'm not sure we all
will find answers.

101
00:07:53,532 --> 00:07:57,404
But I can tell you that we
blessed that we get a chance ...

102
00:07:57,487 --> 00:08:01,164
a legend,
able to establish a history.

103
00:08:05,797 --> 00:08:07,506
Pancakes.

104
00:08:10,232 --> 00:08:11,827
Hey.

105
00:08:14,058 --> 00:08:18,604
<i> I'm going to a few questions
and want you to honestly answer, right? </i>

106
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:24,107
<i> not think too much, is that right?
- Great, but ask your questions.</i>

107
00:08:24,384 --> 00:08:26,551
<i> What is your name?
- I have already ..</i>

108
00:08:26,552 --> 00:08:30,519
<i> I see, Cy Banbridge. </i>

109
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,454
<i> What are you here? </i>

110
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:35,512
<i> Arkinlot.
- Good enough.</i>

111
00:08:36,857 --> 00:08:42,117
<i>What  smell you associate with the color red?
- You're definitely a joke?</i>

112
00:08:42,723 --> 00:08:46,649
<i> Cherry, I cherry. </i>

113
00:08:49,255 --> 00:08:52,293
<i> What does that mean?
- That you have no brain damage.</i>

114
00:09:07,972 --> 00:09:10,098
Here.
- You keep him with you.

115
00:09:38,222 --> 00:09:41,781
Here, this way.
- Here?

116
00:09:46,105 --> 00:09:50,558
According to this, and the coordinates that you
should have given it here.

117
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:52,681
That thing is broken.

118
00:09:52,682 --> 00:09:55,895
These coordinates are correct.
- Do you see a path somewhere then?

119
00:10:15,507 --> 00:10:17,494
We are looking for a mountain path.

120
00:10:17,699 --> 00:10:21,221
Are you a bunch of backward walking,
or something? For you are in a cinema.

121
00:10:21,344 --> 00:10:23,600
Hey, wait a minute.
- Fuck you.

122
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:27,083
Tickets are eight dollars,
So 56 of you together.

123
00:10:27,175 --> 00:10:29,606
So you go watch a movie?

124
00:10:29,979 --> 00:10:32,058
Hey, you're awesome.

125
00:10:32,734 --> 00:10:34,982
Forward, this is not happening.

126
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:38,396
We're outta here.

127
00:11:31,479 --> 00:11:32,900
What are we looking?

128
00:11:33,812 --> 00:11:37,125
Something with guns, tits,
and the end of the world.

129
00:11:41,045 --> 00:11:42,828
Nobody wants to talk to us.

130
00:11:44,476 --> 00:11:48,274
It's good. I am not one of the evil,
just jealous.

131
00:11:49,815 --> 00:11:53,560
Why?
- Because you can walk down the road.

132
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:58,787
Only we can not,
for there is no path, right?

133
00:12:00,529 --> 00:12:03,281
The coordinates were false,
in one way or another ...

134
00:12:04,242 --> 00:12:07,312
they lead us here, why we are here
Now go run like motherfuckers.

135
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,108
Has anyone ordered to
not to talk to us?

136
00:12:19,726 --> 00:12:21,280
My grandfather has
worried me this job.

137
00:12:21,982 --> 00:12:26,396
He has been the owner for a while, until
He died of throat cancer last year.

138
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:30,539
He was friends with the owner.

139
00:12:30,877 --> 00:12:35,572
That was before everyone walked away.
- Your grandfather was here in 39, 40?

140
00:12:35,741 --> 00:12:38,824
To houthaktripjes weekend, yes.

141
00:12:40,683 --> 00:12:42,457
I have to change the coil.
- Wait a minute.

142
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:43,704
I am a movie star and become
now paid.

143
00:12:47,841 --> 00:12:50,637
Reach right down
on the back.

144
00:12:50,941 --> 00:12:55,983
Left over from the past:
"Gone With The Wind" original print.

145
00:12:58,558 --> 00:13:01,096
That's half the Oz movie.

146
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:04,278
Who was stuck in the projector.

147
00:13:04,478 --> 00:13:08,459
He plays it no longer, it is worn
touched by all the times playing.

148
00:13:09,545 --> 00:13:12,602
Hey, I did not say
you could use me as a source, right?

149
00:13:14,352 --> 00:13:18,228
I do not have much money.
- You have something much better, an expedition.

150
00:13:18,229 --> 00:13:19,195
Listen!
- You take me in the leg.

151
00:13:19,211 --> 00:13:21,292
I walk my own stuff,
I can cook.

152
00:13:21,293 --> 00:13:24,486
I can tell you everything
I know the book.

153
00:13:24,487 --> 00:13:27,409
I have no real family anymore,
no money to go to the South.

154
00:13:28,106 --> 00:13:32,029
Please, you must take me.
- I appreciate it, but you're not listening.

155
00:13:33,281 --> 00:13:37,458
There is no path.
There is no journey.

156
00:13:37,459 --> 00:13:39,254
But there is a path.

157
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,594
Have you seen it?
- There is even a marker.

158
00:13:44,395 --> 00:13:47,848
Stone.
It says 'yellow brick road' on.

159
00:13:49,003 --> 00:13:51,462
We drink it now and then,
when we are afraid.

160
00:13:53,129 --> 00:13:55,409
I have the first 100 meters once walked.

161
00:14:11,888 --> 00:14:15,637
YELLOW BRICK ROAD

162
00:15:11,845 --> 00:15:15,051
<i> What is your full name
- Ann Liliane Luger.</i>

163
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:19,119
<i> I want you to talk Jibbrisch
until I say you should stop. </i>

164
00:15:26,376 --> 00:15:28,187
<i> Ann, stop it.
- Okay.</i>

165
00:15:29,276 --> 00:15:31,417
<i> Without looking at your watch
Can you tell me what time it is? </i>

166
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:35,210
<i> 15.17 hours.
- Well done.</i>

167
00:15:35,238 --> 00:15:38,156
<i> Two times two is four.
Four times four is eight. </i>

168
00:15:38,157 --> 00:15:40,579
<i> Two times eight is sixteen. </i>

169
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:43,561
<i> Sixteen times two is thirty-two. </i>

170
00:15:43,562 --> 00:15:46,823
<i> Thirty-two times two is sixty-four. </i>

171
00:15:46,824 --> 00:15:50,206
<i>Sixty-four times two is
one hundred twenty-eight. </i>

172
00:16:15,854 --> 00:16:18,517
Another hour.

173
00:16:18,597 --> 00:16:21,313
You could break your wrist again,
that would be nice.

174
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:24,115
Only one hour, right?

175
00:16:39,288 --> 00:16:42,747
Indian cucumber,
Count on them but, they are tasty.

176
00:16:42,748 --> 00:16:43,984
Cool.

177
00:16:50,534 --> 00:16:53,091
How do you feel now?

178
00:16:54,702 --> 00:16:58,337
<i> a bit excited, full of insects,
but otherwise great. </i>

179
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:01,584
<i>Make  ongoing movement,
until I say stop. </i>

180
00:17:05,992 --> 00:17:08,946
<i> I'm not finished.
- I said stop. Thank you. </i>

181
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,655
<i> Count prime numbers,
start at two. </i>

182
00:17:16,509 --> 00:17:18,225
Two, three.

183
00:17:18,258 --> 00:17:19,939
Five, seven.

184
00:17:20,357 --> 00:17:22,743
Eleven, thirteen. Seventeen ...

185
00:17:22,744 --> 00:17:26,027
nineteen, twenty-three.
- Fantastic. Stop.

186
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:35,069
I won the Olympics for fastest lighter
four years in a row.

187
00:17:36,392 --> 00:17:40,235
Summer Camp Olympics, of course.
- Fastest lighter?

188
00:17:41,244 --> 00:17:42,636
How do you do that?

189
00:17:42,636 --> 00:17:45,611
You tie a rope 18 cm
above the ground ...

190
00:17:45,612 --> 00:17:49,956
and the first who, by
through fire, wins.

191
00:17:49,957 --> 00:17:55,671
18 inches? Child's play.
I do it twice as fast, at least.

192
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:11,197
Hey, Cy!
Moose are dangerous?

193
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:15,317
Yes, with moose mess, for sure.

194
00:18:15,505 --> 00:18:19,025
I have seen how someone on the horns
took him and threw 15 meters far.

195
00:18:19,043 --> 00:18:22,278
If that's all you are worried about.
I do not hate bears.

196
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:24,824
A bear kills a lot more than a moose.

197
00:18:24,825 --> 00:18:27,620
Yes, but it's the horns,
I'm not on the horns.

198
00:18:27,775 --> 00:18:29,540
Hey, guys.

199
00:18:33,232 --> 00:18:35,765
Give to me.
- Give me that.

200
00:18:35,767 --> 00:18:37,948
One, two ...

201
00:18:39,423 --> 00:18:42,411
Cy?
- You want to trade? Lollipop, lollipop.

202
00:18:43,013 --> 00:18:44,897
Stop!

203
00:18:45,176 --> 00:18:46,509
No one moves.

204
00:18:56,517 --> 00:18:59,560
Grab your soul!
- Asshole!

205
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:04,098
How do you get that?
- Just found.

206
00:19:04,636 --> 00:19:07,935
In the woods when I had to pee.
I almost slipped on the leaves.

207
00:19:10,874 --> 00:19:13,917
Have you peed on?
- Very out mid thirties.

208
00:19:13,918 --> 00:19:15,245
Someone takes the piss us.
- Look at the label.

209
00:19:15,246 --> 00:19:19,859
You chased me the meaning of fear.
- Wait, look.

210
00:19:20,004 --> 00:19:23,339
Impossible for this hat
70 years is located here.

211
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,065
Maybe someone lost it.

212
00:19:25,819 --> 00:19:27,668
At this time.

213
00:19:28,324 --> 00:19:32,623
Someone close.
- So my spine.

214
00:19:32,624 --> 00:19:35,488
Nice try, but that's wrong.

215
00:19:37,253 --> 00:19:39,562
We should keep him well.
- Can I put it on?

216
00:19:40,056 --> 00:19:41,780
Why would you want to put it on?

217
00:19:42,536 --> 00:19:45,145
I do not know, it seems best
good way to keep the hat.

218
00:19:45,873 --> 00:19:47,205
Of course.

219
00:19:51,786 --> 00:19:53,796
Wait a minute.
Do not do it with the hat.

220
00:19:57,114 --> 00:19:59,761
Your name?
- Melissa Barnes.

221
00:19:59,762 --> 00:20:03,256
Where are you now?
- On the path. We are on the path.

222
00:20:03,256 --> 00:20:07,554
<i> How do you feel?
- Well, actually good.</i>

223
00:20:08,117 --> 00:20:10,915
<i> Occasionally some pain in the stomach,
but otherwise ...</i>

224
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:14,201
<i> What do you associate with the color blue? </i>

225
00:20:15,093 --> 00:20:19,221
<i>ammonia or chlorine might
as in a pool. </i>

226
00:20:19,901 --> 00:20:23,892
Congratulations, or something.
- I'll see you at the camp.

227
00:20:29,582 --> 00:20:33,242
So, fall in October 1940.
- Yes.

228
00:20:33,951 --> 00:20:37,136
and that would be about 15 ...

229
00:20:37,547 --> 00:20:40,864
And Roosevelt gave no
any attention to the woods.

230
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:42,449
Nobody does that.

231
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,143
People lose hope ...

232
00:20:44,144 --> 00:20:48,910
and spend all their time and I
mean all their time in the bios.

233
00:20:48,911 --> 00:20:52,547
Sitting staring as gnomes.
- And in the Emerald City.

234
00:20:52,548 --> 00:20:56,589
Indeed.
- How about the official records?

235
00:20:57,731 --> 00:21:02,307
Was the only credible
of myself. So I went to Friar.

236
00:21:02,308 --> 00:21:05,510
To see for yourself.
Spoke with a staff member.

237
00:21:05,511 --> 00:21:07,905
What did you think?

238
00:21:07,906 --> 00:21:12,586
They have not left everything behind.
Only the stuff they took.

239
00:21:12,587 --> 00:21:14,634
<i> Not the things you would expect. </i>

240
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:19,024
<i> He said the evening dress was gone. </i>

241
00:21:19,607 --> 00:21:21,722
<i> hats, costumes and other things. </i>

242
00:21:21,723 --> 00:21:24,475
Melissa told us that only
after we took the hats.

243
00:21:25,096 --> 00:21:26,382
<i>He thought we  music
it had taken. </i>

244
00:21:26,829 --> 00:21:30,505
<i> On one of his old photos that he attended the
creek came back we just left </i>

245
00:21:32,088 --> 00:21:34,543
It's amateurish,
that's ridiculous.

246
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:37,954
Just wait until we're sure.

247
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:42,414
If you say ...

248
00:21:43,075 --> 00:21:44,414
Idiots.

249
00:21:45,249 --> 00:21:48,400
Coordinate 5 at 11.9 degrees
to the northwest.

250
00:21:54,486 --> 00:21:57,866
Coordinate 6 at 7.01 degrees
to the northwest.

251
00:22:04,953 --> 00:22:06,913
Coordinator: are you ready?
- Go on.

252
00:22:07,739 --> 00:22:11,859
Coordinate seven is 62 degrees,
it is now the North.

253
00:22:13,475 --> 00:22:14,799
Eight?

254
00:22:15,523 --> 00:22:17,680
Demonstrate eyes, I have to recalibrate.

255
00:22:26,753 --> 00:22:28,778
It tastes still nowhere.

256
00:22:31,537 --> 00:22:33,423
Take that hat off.

257
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:36,284
I mean it.

258
00:22:48,235 --> 00:22:51,318
What?
- A problem.

259
00:23:00,048 --> 00:23:01,821
Have you made it much?

260
00:23:04,212 --> 00:23:06,690
<i> This is Teddy, do you hear me? </i>

261
00:23:08,598 --> 00:23:09,995
We are over.

262
00:23:10,444 --> 00:23:12,693
<i> GPS indicates that we are Quam over. </i>

263
00:23:14,841 --> 00:23:16,179
What did you say about?

264
00:23:16,641 --> 00:23:19,687
<i> Whatever.
Over and out. </i>

265
00:23:22,564 --> 00:23:26,590
Intern, where did we get here?

266
00:23:33,055 --> 00:23:36,037
Forty miles northwest of Florence.

267
00:24:21,826 --> 00:24:23,638
Would be a Tide Mill.

268
00:24:24,636 --> 00:24:26,141
Far away.

269
00:24:28,189 --> 00:24:29,999
Wind tunnel.

270
00:24:31,166 --> 00:24:33,480
Natural amphibian theater, anyone?

271
00:24:41,808 --> 00:24:45,092
<i> Hey, Jill the intern, where are we now? </i>

272
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,463
Just outside Melbourne.

273
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:54,773
<i>Hello  Melborne.
The dingo took my baby </i>

274
00:24:59,644 --> 00:25:03,864
<i>Object  four, this is day three.
First memory that comes to mind. </i>

275
00:25:03,865 --> 00:25:07,613
<i> My first cat, Reddy. </i>

276
00:25:07,614 --> 00:25:10,933
<i>Remember how  sounded Reddy
- Yes.</i>

277
00:25:11,648 --> 00:25:15,071
<i> Can you imitate that sound?
- Should I meow?</i>

278
00:25:15,072 --> 00:25:16,705
<i> Yes. </i>

279
00:25:39,499 --> 00:25:41,691
Stop the engine!

280
00:26:38,256 --> 00:26:40,143
I've heard.
- I heard it too.

281
00:26:40,144 --> 00:26:42,712
Oh, my God, oh my God,
Oh, my God, oh my God,

282
00:26:42,713 --> 00:26:44,586
Oh, my God, oh my God.

283
00:26:49,429 --> 00:26:54,298
<i> Theories, a: solar flares,
egomorfologie and magnetism. </i>

284
00:26:54,331 --> 00:26:57,969
<i>Two : human presence.
As Cy suggested. </i>

285
00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:00,248
<i>That we  thwarted by the FBI. </i>

286
00:27:00,281 --> 00:27:02,315
<i> Three: selective hallucination. </i>

287
00:27:02,316 --> 00:27:06,729
<i>We  the psychosis as
if it were a disease. Maybe far-fetched. </i>

288
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:09,705
<i>But Daryl  and Walter's work with
indicate the noise levels on ...</i>

289
00:27:09,706 --> 00:27:11,551
<i>That the  the end of the road. </i>

290
00:27:12,097 --> 00:27:16,105
<i> Four: they are the people of the Friar.
- They are the "runners."</i>

291
00:27:16,643 --> 00:27:18,887
<i> In some ways they appear. </i>

292
00:27:19,579 --> 00:27:22,493
<i> This is what we know: "We're not crazy '</i>

293
00:27:22,984 --> 00:27:26,199
<i>Our instruments  store stampedes.
We are five days away </i>

294
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,202
<i> from civilization with luggage. </i>

295
00:27:28,721 --> 00:27:30,287
<i>Three  no. </i>

296
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:33,688
So here we are, this
meeting is officially ...

297
00:27:33,689 --> 00:27:36,621
the ability to go back.

298
00:27:36,622 --> 00:27:37,774
What?

299
00:27:38,643 --> 00:27:40,672
No, no, you can not be serious.

300
00:27:40,673 --> 00:27:44,517
For I am the one who proposes
to return.

301
00:27:44,518 --> 00:27:47,003
None of your theories explain the music.

302
00:27:47,509 --> 00:27:49,312
How do you explain the music?

303
00:27:49,903 --> 00:27:51,853
How can we all crazy,
I do not understand that.

304
00:27:51,854 --> 00:27:53,979
They listened to this music.

305
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:56,558
Over and over again,
My grandfather told me that himself.

306
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:59,481
You saw the film reels, they
were addicted to.

307
00:27:59,481 --> 00:28:01,206
Wait, take it easy.

308
00:28:01,734 --> 00:28:05,402
Jill, the intern said something funny
and I want more info.

309
00:28:05,465 --> 00:28:10,396
Intern, repeat, please.
- Ikabi, never mind.

310
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:12,036
God!

311
00:28:13,134 --> 00:28:17,169
Theory five, "The act of God. "
- This is really ridiculous.

312
00:28:17,202 --> 00:28:19,652
What if the population of Friar
assumed that this ...

313
00:28:19,653 --> 00:28:22,149
"The way to God. "

314
00:28:23,383 --> 00:28:27,972
A magician, or something to stop the war.

315
00:28:27,973 --> 00:28:30,881
You can always magician
ask for something, right?

316
00:28:30,882 --> 00:28:32,789
Anything?
- No!

317
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:36,323
Because if you was old enough to remember
The magician is a little bald dictator.

318
00:28:37,135 --> 00:28:40,235
Everyone must make its voice heard.
- Can you please stop it?

319
00:28:40,236 --> 00:28:45,372
I think we do not know what
going on here and we should go.

320
00:28:46,073 --> 00:28:47,289
I'm afraid.

321
00:28:47,945 --> 00:28:51,720
I think we should consider both.
- But Walter ...

322
00:28:52,569 --> 00:28:57,964
If there is an end, and there is something
or someone, what would you ask?

323
00:28:57,998 --> 00:29:00,490
This is a very personal question.

324
00:29:01,219 --> 00:29:06,148
What is your answer, Mr. Barnes?
- Ask him to smile at the camera.

325
00:29:07,242 --> 00:29:09,659
That's all I need.

326
00:29:27,748 --> 00:29:31,370
We both go.
- We do not know where North is.

327
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:35,922
I call Northeast North.
17 degrees.

328
00:29:38,131 --> 00:29:38,828
How did you do that?

329
00:29:38,829 --> 00:29:41,170
Your sister said you tools
not do well.

330
00:29:41,171 --> 00:29:43,650
Yes, but I do.
That's the North.

331
00:29:43,651 --> 00:29:45,714
You can almost map-reading,
or you're not so good?

332
00:29:45,715 --> 00:29:48,695
I'm too good.
It's a triple magnetic force ...

333
00:29:49,448 --> 00:29:53,400
in the opposite direction, as
They flush toilets in Australia.

334
00:29:54,029 --> 00:29:56,015
Leads to the center?
- Yes.

335
00:29:56,637 --> 00:30:00,527
I think it comes from the music.
- Jill, I want to coordinate.

336
00:30:00,528 --> 00:30:01,875
Just like us.
- We have not yet.

337
00:30:01,876 --> 00:30:03,796
We have to go south.

338
00:30:03,797 --> 00:30:07,455
Okay, start preparing.
- I'm working on it.

339
00:30:15,258 --> 00:30:18,019
What is your full name?
- Liv Michelle McCann.

340
00:30:18,174 --> 00:30:20,776
Should I look at you or the camera?
- Look into the camera.

341
00:30:21,812 --> 00:30:23,285
<i> Where is you now? </i>

342
00:30:23,914 --> 00:30:26,698
<i>Daryl said we  100 km
In Yellow Brick Road are. </i>

343
00:30:27,186 --> 00:30:29,426
<i> We hear the music since yesterday morning. </i>

344
00:30:29,903 --> 00:30:31,990
<i> Say the alphabet backwards. </i>

345
00:30:33,462 --> 00:30:36,006
<i> Z, y, x, w, v, u, </i>

346
00:30:37,516 --> 00:30:40,238
<i> ... t
- That's enough.</i>

347
00:30:40,239 --> 00:30:41,675
<i> No, let me finish. </i>

348
00:30:41,783 --> 00:30:45,785
<i> V, u, t, s, r, </i>

349
00:30:49,882 --> 00:30:53,876
<i> Q, p, n, m, I, </i>

350
00:30:54,439 --> 00:30:57,976
<i> Damn!
What was there again for L </i>

351
00:30:59,703 --> 00:31:02,774
<i> L, k, j. .. </i>

352
00:31:03,769 --> 00:31:06,531
<i> i, h, j, f. .. </i>

353
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:09,594
<i> e, d, c, b, a. </i>

354
00:31:13,921 --> 00:31:15,969
There's another one.

355
00:31:16,582 --> 00:31:18,726
Another intersection, people.

356
00:32:06,395 --> 00:32:09,730
What are you talking about?
- What do you think?

357
00:32:11,148 --> 00:32:12,797
I'm not going back.

358
00:32:14,219 --> 00:32:17,969
Not going back.
- I'm not going back.

359
00:32:21,618 --> 00:32:24,915
Your little heart goes so fast again.

360
00:32:25,797 --> 00:32:27,197
It is not small.

361
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:49,787
<i> I think this is already the slope. </i>

362
00:32:50,923 --> 00:32:53,309
You're not where you are supposed to be about.

363
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:00,597
Daryl, I know this should be fun ...

364
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:03,360
but it is not.

365
00:33:04,619 --> 00:33:06,297
Take the hat off.

366
00:33:08,745 --> 00:33:10,502
<i> How do you feel now? </i>

367
00:33:11,133 --> 00:33:12,890
<i> I feel hondsmoe. </i>

368
00:33:14,141 --> 00:33:16,918
<i> talk in Hebrew
until I say you can stop. </i>

369
00:33:20,092 --> 00:33:21,635
<i>Well  stop. </i>

370
00:33:24,827 --> 00:33:27,535
<i>Repeat until the gesture
I say you can stop. </i>

371
00:33:31,352 --> 00:33:32,833
<i> Teddy </i>

372
00:33:47,434 --> 00:33:49,975
It's pretty good.
- Get your arm off me.

373
00:33:54,294 --> 00:33:56,123
I was just ...

374
00:33:58,924 --> 00:34:01,118
I missed the music.
That's all.

375
00:34:04,748 --> 00:34:06,389
Where it remained.

376
00:34:07,344 --> 00:34:08,957
When it comes back?

377
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:13,338
We've heard it before,
you miss it?

378
00:34:13,991 --> 00:34:15,992
No.

379
00:34:22,422 --> 00:34:25,581
What did you see on the tapes?
- No, it's different for everyone.

380
00:34:26,125 --> 00:34:31,061
It's like separations, delays,
association, memory loss.

381
00:34:32,305 --> 00:34:34,666
So many people forget the way back.

382
00:34:35,426 --> 00:34:37,339
Daryl has the coordinates clearly
written down.

383
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:40,491
I'm not talking about the way home.
I'm on the way back to the beginning.

384
00:34:40,492 --> 00:34:44,471
Who we were when we started.
- We are here, Walter.

385
00:34:46,346 --> 00:34:49,428
We are passed.
I'm sure.

386
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:50,999
We have enough for the book.

387
00:34:51,713 --> 00:34:55,063
It's not about the book,
but for you. You always try ...

388
00:34:55,578 --> 00:34:58,708
things to get you
not even understand. You do not see.

389
00:34:59,569 --> 00:35:02,775
And this time it drives me really afraid.

390
00:35:07,694 --> 00:35:10,162
Why?
- Do you see this?

391
00:35:10,998 --> 00:35:12,188
Look carefully.

392
00:35:12,772 --> 00:35:14,835
Go on, everybody.

393
00:35:15,998 --> 00:35:19,929
Poisonous berries.
Atropa belladona.

394
00:35:20,805 --> 00:35:25,032
Night Shade.
Make sure you can keep them apart.

395
00:35:25,745 --> 00:35:28,224
Dangerous and poisonous berries.

396
00:35:28,225 --> 00:35:31,138
I ate him up.
I pressed him fine.

397
00:35:31,139 --> 00:35:34,978
It does not seem dangerous berry.
- Dangerous and poisonous berries.

398
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:52,913
You know what?
We have earned a celebration.

399
00:35:54,156 --> 00:35:58,463
Okay, but look good,
I mean it.

400
00:35:59,723 --> 00:36:01,917
The fastest lighter, so.

401
00:36:04,281 --> 00:36:08,700
This will really happen.
Somebody get me some in the glass.

402
00:36:13,615 --> 00:36:17,069
<i> Put it on fire.
- Do not let it go out.</i>

403
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:19,034
<i> Burn it.
- Do not let it go out.</i>

404
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:24,280
<i> Jesus
- Ten times closer than I thought.</i>

405
00:36:25,924 --> 00:36:29,176
<i> Why do not we have a smooth
in case someone is cheating? </i>

406
00:36:29,594 --> 00:36:32,562
<i> These are questions for the magician,
ask him that. </i>

407
00:36:37,258 --> 00:36:38,645
<i> There are things ...</i>

408
00:36:39,374 --> 00:36:40,696
<i> I do not want to see. </i>

409
00:36:40,697 --> 00:36:45,351
<i> What are you talking about, it's good. </i>

410
00:36:46,764 --> 00:36:50,388
<i> I eat things.
- They look like hallucinations.</i>

411
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:54,830
<i> We should know.
- There's no place like home.</i>

412
00:36:54,864 --> 00:36:58,267
<i> There is no place like home ...
- Guys.</i>

413
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:03,310
Let me, I want to sleep.

414
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:08,170
I lied.

415
00:37:11,769 --> 00:37:13,460
That's different, yes.

416
00:37:14,274 --> 00:37:17,523
I never knew my grandfather.
He lived in Maine.

417
00:37:18,613 --> 00:37:20,828
But I am grown up in Friar.

418
00:37:21,641 --> 00:37:23,298
Go to sleep now.

419
00:37:27,709 --> 00:37:29,797
You should have known.

420
00:37:30,517 --> 00:37:33,572
All that gevraag why they
went on the road.

421
00:37:33,573 --> 00:37:36,657
The people of Friar questions
is not it.

422
00:37:36,658 --> 00:37:39,612
If you live there you understand.

423
00:37:42,753 --> 00:37:45,783
It's not something you
a book about writing.

424
00:38:29,518 --> 00:38:32,935
<i> The first thing I asked Jill morning
was a childhood memory. </i>

425
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:36,399
<i> She told me that it
the end of the Yellow Brick Road was. </i>

426
00:38:40,032 --> 00:38:43,072
We achieve the
end of the day, right?

427
00:38:44,609 --> 00:38:48,328
We take the hint?
- Give her one day.

428
00:38:50,285 --> 00:38:52,095
A day.

429
00:39:03,366 --> 00:39:04,835
Wait a minute.

430
00:39:07,847 --> 00:39:09,315
We must take sides.

431
00:39:10,028 --> 00:39:12,885
Argo and take the bowl
behind us?

432
00:39:16,584 --> 00:39:17,470
No, we wait.

433
00:39:18,724 --> 00:39:20,540
Come on.

434
00:39:22,772 --> 00:39:28,253
Everyone, this 15 minutes
ensure that we can continue.

435
00:39:43,312 --> 00:39:47,729
Your fingerprints are everywhere.
- "Your fingerprints are everywhere."

436
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:53,477
You know, you look out lousy.

437
00:39:55,452 --> 00:39:58,015
Is it damaged?
- No.

438
00:39:58,016 --> 00:39:59,745
You have damaged the lamp.
- No.

439
00:40:00,197 --> 00:40:02,176
Is it damaged?
- No.

440
00:40:02,986 --> 00:40:04,377
Take the hat off.
- Is it damaged?

441
00:40:04,378 --> 00:40:08,371
Put that damn hat, I mean it.
Take that hat off.

442
00:40:08,372 --> 00:40:10,699
Give it to me. Take it off
and give it to me.

443
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:14,078
Shut up and do the hat.
Take off!

444
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,338
If you do not alter ...

445
00:41:15,756 --> 00:41:17,551
Daryl, no!

446
00:41:50,194 --> 00:41:51,710
He heads for the trees.
- Let me see.

447
00:41:51,711 --> 00:41:53,935
Stay there and be quiet.

448
00:41:53,936 --> 00:41:59,015
Jill, walk away. We walked ...
- What have you seen Walter?

449
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:02,402
It killed her. Tore her to pieces.
- Why?

450
00:42:03,036 --> 00:42:05,769
They had a fight about that hat.

451
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:09,224
What?
Walter, what happened?

452
00:42:11,006 --> 00:42:12,616
Listen to me all.

453
00:42:17,712 --> 00:42:20,751
Eric is dead.
- Yes.

454
00:42:32,766 --> 00:42:34,743
There is a terrible tragedy happened.

455
00:42:37,278 --> 00:42:40,251
Walter, you and I set up an emergency camp
here, and Teddy and Cy ...

456
00:42:40,742 --> 00:42:43,593
take the knife and collect whatever you can.

457
00:42:44,267 --> 00:42:46,925
Go find him.
- We just go home.

458
00:42:46,926 --> 00:42:50,190
Daryl knows the way to go home.
- He has done it often enough.

459
00:42:50,191 --> 00:42:52,001
He has no book.

460
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:55,529
If we can find the way home.
I can find our way.

461
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:56,489
I agree with Cy.

462
00:42:58,031 --> 00:43:02,094
Let the music stop!
- Scaremongering.

463
00:43:02,095 --> 00:43:04,099
Get him back.

464
00:43:29,059 --> 00:43:30,486
Seven.

465
00:43:31,565 --> 00:43:34,077
Let it go and find him.
- No ...

466
00:43:34,609 --> 00:43:36,513
No, we do not.

467
00:43:54,126 --> 00:43:55,264
Melissa.

468
00:43:56,147 --> 00:43:58,119
Melissa?
- What?

469
00:43:58,839 --> 00:44:01,741
Forget it.
- What is it, Jo?

470
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:05,637
I wondered if I had a candy bar
should have.

471
00:44:07,954 --> 00:44:11,393
Well, I get it all.

472
00:44:12,183 --> 00:44:13,459
It's pretty good.

473
00:44:13,935 --> 00:44:17,978
It's all right, Jill. Teddy and Sarah
Daryl get back and then we go home.

474
00:44:17,979 --> 00:44:20,088
Do you believe me?
- I believe you.

475
00:44:20,089 --> 00:44:21,677
I do not.

476
00:44:23,566 --> 00:44:26,804
I water
and some help, right?

477
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:31,832
We need to merge
and Mark, right?

478
00:44:31,833 --> 00:44:34,039
We can not leave.
- We go back.

479
00:44:34,435 --> 00:44:38,594
What are you looking?
- Something bright to the body marking.

480
00:44:39,229 --> 00:44:42,191
Liz is not alone.
- I do not care.

481
00:44:51,541 --> 00:44:53,440
They go through Aaron.

482
00:44:54,652 --> 00:44:57,507
Did you go see him this way?
- I think so.

483
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:00,278
But I do not know what I saw.

484
00:45:00,803 --> 00:45:02,994
Oh God, let it stop.

485
00:45:03,673 --> 00:45:07,299
It seems it's doing that on purpose.
- Sure, instant.

486
00:45:15,862 --> 00:45:18,109
Did you know?
- I saw it too.

487
00:45:18,923 --> 00:45:20,028
I saw it.

488
00:45:21,017 --> 00:45:22,769
Turn that thing off.

489
00:45:28,669 --> 00:45:30,305
Daryl?

490
00:45:35,752 --> 00:45:37,484
Daryl, give me answers.

491
00:45:38,181 --> 00:45:41,594
We know you're there.
- Hello?

492
00:45:42,733 --> 00:45:47,547
<i> Guys, I think
I've done something really awful. </i>

493
00:45:47,548 --> 00:45:51,182
We know.
We know, and it's good.

494
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:54,444
<i> I hurt my leg. </i>

495
00:45:54,463 --> 00:45:58,516
We will help you,
come here it's good.

496
00:46:03,145 --> 00:46:05,968
Daryl, I want you to good
I listen.

497
00:46:11,559 --> 00:46:13,071
<i> You're not in trouble. </i>

498
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:16,271
<i> I know. </i>

499
00:46:17,416 --> 00:46:19,825
It seems like no one will forgive you.

500
00:46:20,855 --> 00:46:22,536
But you did wrong.

501
00:46:24,523 --> 00:46:28,253
Anyone who loves you
will forgive you.

502
00:46:30,647 --> 00:46:34,313
We thought it all that he says,
but then again not, Daryl.

503
00:46:34,457 --> 00:46:35,659
I ...

504
00:46:37,692 --> 00:46:41,627
I thought it all day long,
we all.

505
00:46:44,114 --> 00:46:45,486
I thought about killing him.

506
00:46:46,299 --> 00:46:48,578
I thought so too, Daryl.

507
00:46:49,205 --> 00:46:51,124
<i>Can you
not just leave? </i>

508
00:46:53,532 --> 00:46:55,518
<i> That you can not, do you? </i>

509
00:46:56,911 --> 00:47:02,573
Maybe we should get him.
- No, no, no. It is not necessary.

510
00:47:03,511 --> 00:47:07,673
I'm coming.
- That's good.

511
00:47:08,362 --> 00:47:10,741
That's right, Daryl, thanks.

512
00:47:12,919 --> 00:47:15,858
<i> I just tie a rope around your hands. </i>

513
00:47:15,939 --> 00:47:18,187
<i> This is a security measure, right? </i>

514
00:47:18,188 --> 00:47:23,185
Yes. That's better.

515
00:47:27,919 --> 00:47:29,178
That's it.

516
00:47:30,144 --> 00:47:32,577
Okay, Daryl.
- Tie me up.

517
00:47:34,224 --> 00:47:35,682
Now.

518
00:48:11,085 --> 00:48:13,170
I love him for a while in the holes.

519
00:48:20,625 --> 00:48:24,446
I feel my hands.
- I do not care.

520
00:48:25,105 --> 00:48:28,515
Tie the rope to loosen.

521
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:45,869
I have questions about the coordinates.
- Do you like music, Teddy?

522
00:48:47,503 --> 00:48:51,786
Music has never been my thing.
But that song ...

523
00:48:52,522 --> 00:48:56,657
That song starts to get me in his power.
Begins in his power to get you?

524
00:48:58,962 --> 00:49:00,935
I hear the people and the music.

525
00:49:01,712 --> 00:49:07,117
I hear those who have walked the path.
- The coordinates.

526
00:49:07,118 --> 00:49:10,200
I can not our home.
- You can believe me, you.

527
00:49:10,749 --> 00:49:13,191
Look at the pages, Teddy.
I mean, look.

528
00:49:13,329 --> 00:49:17,452
Yesterday morning at 48.3 miles Pedo Meter ...

529
00:49:17,453 --> 00:49:21,055
and it turned out to be 29.2 miles
adding the coordinates when we ...

530
00:49:21,056 --> 00:49:23,790
and went to the South.

531
00:49:23,791 --> 00:49:26,212
The next morning
We at 8.45 of the camp

532
00:49:26,212 --> 00:49:31,401
8.2 miles from Pedo meter, while
There were 19 miles out.

533
00:49:32,429 --> 00:49:37,421
We looked at three miles further back, and we
saw the camp on the scope not even.

534
00:49:37,422 --> 00:49:42,624
The coordinates are correct, otherwise you would have
said anything, Aaron had said something.

535
00:49:42,890 --> 00:49:47,249
No, if you follow the yellow brick road
The coordinates are difficult.

536
00:49:48,185 --> 00:49:52,574
They count on, it becomes clear
as you go along.

537
00:49:53,036 --> 00:49:56,243
That's exactly how we make choices
by moving forward.

538
00:49:57,169 --> 00:49:59,174
Looking back is a different story.

539
00:50:00,034 --> 00:50:03,476
Looking back, looking at
page to page.

540
00:50:04,881 --> 00:50:06,491
The whole country is like ...

541
00:50:07,722 --> 00:50:10,279
liquid.
- Show me how it works.

542
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:12,689
Look on the last page.

543
00:50:14,457 --> 00:50:18,802
So you come to the end of the path, Teddy.
Think it on.

544
00:51:01,663 --> 00:51:04,784
What does he do?
- I do not know, maybe nothing.

545
00:51:06,509 --> 00:51:08,856
I hear a pattern.
- You're kidding.

546
00:51:12,986 --> 00:51:17,600
We can not make it disappear?

547
00:51:25,828 --> 00:51:27,696
You talk too much.
- Go away.

548
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:45,421
Please, get out.

549
00:55:24,987 --> 00:55:27,070
Useless.

550
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:34,759
That's the way home.

551
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:37,766
He wrote it down.
- Stay tuned!

552
00:55:37,767 --> 00:55:40,559
Daryl was an analyst, so the
coordinates are all arranged.

553
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:42,180
No, it is there.

554
00:55:43,365 --> 00:55:46,158
This is the way back, here it is,
He wrote it down.

555
00:55:46,159 --> 00:55:48,681
I swear to God ...
- You do not.

556
00:55:52,709 --> 00:55:53,976
None of you know me.

557
00:55:54,635 --> 00:55:57,697
You do not even look at me.
- Okay, it's good.

558
00:55:57,698 --> 00:56:01,620
He left behind some equipment, but
we can survive, trust me.

559
00:56:01,621 --> 00:56:03,970
Lady, do you make a joke?

560
00:56:03,971 --> 00:56:06,067
Oh, I am now a "lady"
- Yes, you.

561
00:56:06,068 --> 00:56:09,101
You have even forgotten my name?
- Take it easy.

562
00:56:09,102 --> 00:56:13,231
Do not say that to me.
- Keep your hands off me.

563
00:56:15,241 --> 00:56:17,906
Another reason why we
a word from you to listen?

564
00:56:17,907 --> 00:56:20,124
Because everything comes true.

565
00:56:20,292 --> 00:56:22,896
Teddy and I have to
Siberia looked in the desert.

566
00:56:22,897 --> 00:56:24,381
It means nothing.

567
00:56:24,382 --> 00:56:28,035
What is your plan?
- She did not.

568
00:56:29,208 --> 00:56:33,315
We must stay together, eating
ration and drinking, and then we go.

569
00:56:34,097 --> 00:56:38,128
Not on the path. Let the path dislocate.
To the south. We leave tomorrow morning.

570
00:56:38,129 --> 00:56:40,030
We have the stuff is not it?
- No.

571
00:56:40,667 --> 00:56:43,443
As I see it we go to the west.
- West?

572
00:56:43,444 --> 00:56:45,998
I know there is nothing in the East and
even less in the North, but the West.

573
00:56:45,999 --> 00:56:48,319
It's a better chance.
Maybe we come against them in Vermont.

574
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:51,461
I'm not very comfortable.
- You have had the chance to talk.

575
00:56:52,258 --> 00:56:54,952
I am talking.
- Bullshit.

576
00:56:57,141 --> 00:56:58,928
Want a reason?
I have a reason that it matters!

577
00:56:58,929 --> 00:57:02,815
I have this knife!
That distinction, I do not take our roads.

578
00:57:03,501 --> 00:57:05,882
I can make a way through the wilderness,
can kill a beast ...

579
00:57:06,578 --> 00:57:10,290
or a complete fool with my machete ...

580
00:57:10,291 --> 00:57:12,494
in an off-road driving.

581
00:57:14,335 --> 00:57:16,249
I'm not wait until tomorrow.

582
00:57:17,381 --> 00:57:20,632
I want to know what Teddy think of it.

583
00:57:25,065 --> 00:57:26,898
I think we're heading north
must go further.

584
00:57:28,418 --> 00:57:31,891
Really? It is not an option.
No further north.

585
00:57:32,222 --> 00:57:37,679
Think we should go home with answers.
These questions cost us our lives.

586
00:57:38,209 --> 00:57:42,484
These questions were never asked.

587
00:57:42,485 --> 00:57:44,162
It does not matter anyway.

588
00:57:59,111 --> 00:58:00,434
He's fine.

589
00:58:03,344 --> 00:58:05,247
He fell, but there's nothing wrong.

590
00:58:08,119 --> 00:58:09,031
We go to the south.

591
00:58:09,338 --> 00:58:11,323
Liv and I go to the west
tonight, with or without you.

592
00:58:11,324 --> 00:58:14,116
I'm going to personally kill.
but ...

593
00:58:15,249 --> 00:58:17,343
This does not die with you ...

594
00:58:17,344 --> 00:58:21,303
anyway because they are denied.

595
00:58:21,690 --> 00:58:25,650
And I do not belong to
of a democracy now ...

596
00:58:25,651 --> 00:58:27,685
I promise you.

597
00:58:31,986 --> 00:58:34,302
We need to distribute the stuff.

598
00:58:41,412 --> 00:58:45,916
Take the flashlight.
This is ours. The flashlight ...

599
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:48,077
is yours.

600
00:58:50,409 --> 00:58:52,083
And the water?
- I need you.

601
00:58:52,084 --> 00:58:53,326
That we also need.

602
00:58:54,812 --> 00:58:56,891
Do not let this happen.

603
00:59:25,267 --> 00:59:26,987
We must stand guard.

604
01:00:20,301 --> 01:00:22,214
Stay with me.

605
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:24,979
Stay with me.

606
01:00:29,462 --> 01:00:31,938
Thomas, he is too far away.

607
01:00:32,277 --> 01:00:36,573
Thomas, they see us,
Please stay with me.

608
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:52,217
Where are you, I do not feel?
- I'm here.

609
01:00:54,763 --> 01:00:57,405
Near you.
- That's better.

610
01:00:57,406 --> 01:01:01,264
I dreamed that we arrived home
but it was no longer there.

611
01:01:03,065 --> 01:01:06,458
It's good.
- It was gone.

612
01:01:07,258 --> 01:01:10,154
The grass was black and sky filled with smoke.

613
01:01:10,864 --> 01:01:14,169
And I was there but I was dead.

614
01:01:15,007 --> 01:01:19,854
Everyone was dead and gone.

615
01:01:21,652 --> 01:01:23,207
And I was really scared.

616
01:01:25,985 --> 01:01:28,135
It was the worst time
I woke up because ...

617
01:01:29,722 --> 01:01:32,103
what if this path is now our home?

618
01:02:58,724 --> 01:03:04,312
Focuses on three properties and make sure
you keep a straight line.

619
01:03:11,291 --> 01:03:14,333
You're doing fine, really.

620
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,206
Here.

621
01:03:21,147 --> 01:03:25,016
No.
- Take it. I catch a squirrel later.

622
01:03:34,243 --> 01:03:37,211
Why do not darker than this?
- I do not know.

623
01:03:41,037 --> 01:03:43,795
Are we ever head north?
- You can forget.

624
01:04:00,504 --> 01:04:02,256
Dangerous berries.

625
01:04:02,686 --> 01:04:03,679
Yes.

626
01:04:05,075 --> 01:04:07,019
Not eat them.

627
01:04:08,111 --> 01:04:10,282
I've tried.

628
01:04:11,042 --> 01:04:15,009
I am not died, but ...

629
01:04:16,773 --> 01:04:19,933
You get get high.
- Is that so?

630
01:04:23,995 --> 01:04:26,207
Really really stupid thing to do.

631
01:04:26,610 --> 01:04:30,844
Too much poison, and you get in a daze.

632
01:05:10,404 --> 01:05:13,590
I love this song great!

633
01:05:14,248 --> 01:05:17,290
I think it's beautiful, really beautiful.

634
01:05:19,634 --> 01:05:21,438
I want to walk.

635
01:05:22,790 --> 01:05:27,704
No, no, too dangerous.
We stay here.

636
01:05:29,406 --> 01:05:32,143
Can I touch your hair?
- Okay.

637
01:05:41,279 --> 01:05:44,577
Are you sure we can not walk?
A few more kilometers.

638
01:05:49,412 --> 01:05:52,382
Oh, my God, look!
A squirrel.

639
01:05:57,337 --> 01:06:01,623
Have you eaten?
- I did.

640
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:05,005
I pressed it a few fine
on've tasted.

641
01:06:06,343 --> 01:06:08,545
How it tasted.
- Bloody.

642
01:06:10,237 --> 01:06:12,031
Yes, it is.

643
01:06:13,919 --> 01:06:16,970
I'll kiss you, that's good right?

644
01:06:17,883 --> 01:06:19,218
No.

645
01:06:20,739 --> 01:06:22,496
Really?
- No, Cy.

646
01:06:30,727 --> 01:06:32,078
It was North Dakota.

647
01:06:32,542 --> 01:06:34,303
I do not?

648
01:06:34,304 --> 01:06:36,821
Then we have that woman
bribe to let the dogs.

649
01:06:36,822 --> 01:06:38,668
She would not give for this trip.

650
01:06:38,669 --> 01:06:41,116
Teddy had hives and hives
received from the hot tub.

651
01:06:41,116 --> 01:06:43,017
I believe it.

652
01:06:44,588 --> 01:06:48,641
Mickey will soon die.
Lilian also it is unreliable.

653
01:06:48,833 --> 01:06:52,096
They will not notice that we do not
have come home.

654
01:06:52,097 --> 01:06:54,458
He sits there for days
crying in the dark.

655
01:06:54,459 --> 01:06:55,628
Stop it, Teddy ...

656
01:06:56,471 --> 01:07:00,194
He'll be fine.
We are now on their way home.

657
01:07:01,286 --> 01:07:04,163
Here, do not listen to.
But take it.

658
01:07:07,002 --> 01:07:08,637
These are good.

659
01:07:10,974 --> 01:07:12,097
Ms. Taylor?

660
01:07:12,608 --> 01:07:16,453
Pacman picked up,
Christmas was good.

661
01:07:18,557 --> 01:07:20,465
Third grade, Ms. Scott.

662
01:07:21,021 --> 01:07:24,168
Channel hairy.
I can check a box in one week.

663
01:07:24,986 --> 01:07:27,516
I love Bradly,
but he does not know.

664
01:07:29,434 --> 01:07:30,786
I think I love him.

665
01:07:30,787 --> 01:07:34,852
Let's see if I can find the way back.
Holidays in Cape Corn.

666
01:07:36,445 --> 01:07:38,280
I love the beach.

667
01:07:46,825 --> 01:07:47,718
Are you ...

668
01:07:49,867 --> 01:07:50,860
What?

669
01:07:53,373 --> 01:07:54,663
Are you angry ...

670
01:07:55,722 --> 01:07:56,714
on me?

671
01:07:58,500 --> 01:07:59,458
No.

672
01:08:02,634 --> 01:08:06,040
It's just hard.

673
01:08:08,257 --> 01:08:09,943
Can you help me?

674
01:08:11,630 --> 01:08:12,787
How?

675
01:08:15,632 --> 01:08:17,848
To summarize it all.

676
01:08:20,593 --> 01:08:22,446
We walk right now.

677
01:08:26,876 --> 01:08:29,996
We walk seems like an eternity.

678
01:08:30,758 --> 01:08:32,739
Yes.
- But that's not true.

679
01:08:35,482 --> 01:08:39,434
We were part of a group
people who walked to the North.

680
01:08:40,334 --> 01:08:44,369
Because we wondered why
Another group went to the North.

681
01:08:49,931 --> 01:08:53,220
We are all ever born
and we all die.

682
01:08:54,526 --> 01:08:58,076
We have done many things in between.
Like this.

683
01:08:58,736 --> 01:09:00,763
Sometimes we have a job.

684
01:09:01,411 --> 01:09:02,761
Like you had a job.

685
01:09:03,249 --> 01:09:06,267
And your job was walking down this road.

686
01:09:08,143 --> 01:09:12,517
I lived alone and sold popcorn.

687
01:09:16,166 --> 01:09:19,238
And I lied because I knew it.

688
01:09:21,107 --> 01:09:22,693
I think I have always known.

689
01:09:23,601 --> 01:09:28,297
If you live in a city long enough
you know the real reason why you are walking.

690
01:09:29,151 --> 01:09:31,118
Just as I feel
your eyes are focused on me,

691
01:09:31,119 --> 01:09:33,179
while I can not even be seen.

692
01:09:33,807 --> 01:09:35,953
You always know that the path is there.

693
01:09:36,804 --> 01:09:39,781
Everyone knows the
and nobody says.

694
01:09:40,734 --> 01:09:43,493
You're ashamed because it can be.

695
01:09:45,294 --> 01:09:46,977
A way out.

696
01:09:54,123 --> 01:09:56,886
You feel that the path you will understand.

697
01:09:57,891 --> 01:10:00,636
I think that's the worst.

698
01:10:02,218 --> 01:10:03,949
That it does.

699
01:10:11,359 --> 01:10:13,638
Tomorrow we reach the mountains are.

700
01:10:20,186 --> 01:10:21,826
Hey guys,
check this out.

701
01:10:22,428 --> 01:10:24,211
Not really.
Have you already had all the time?

702
01:10:24,212 --> 01:10:27,349
We need to distribute the food.
- And no one yet knows.

703
01:10:34,755 --> 01:10:36,650
Please?

704
01:10:37,861 --> 01:10:39,296
We are on rations, okay?

705
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:41,951
We still have a long way to go.

706
01:11:33,092 --> 01:11:34,753
I'm sorry.

707
01:11:36,354 --> 01:11:38,351
I was so hungry.

708
01:11:47,235 --> 01:11:49,715
I'm sorry!

709
01:12:49,215 --> 01:12:51,134
<i> It happens to me. </i>

710
01:12:54,375 --> 01:12:56,157
What has happened to Daryl?

711
01:13:03,801 --> 01:13:05,911
Go to sleep now.
- No.

712
01:13:08,133 --> 01:13:11,534
As the music continues,
and we do not quickly find a village ...

713
01:13:15,574 --> 01:13:19,431
I'm something unspeakable with you.

714
01:13:21,958 --> 01:13:22,883
Like what?

715
01:13:27,779 --> 01:13:30,456
I thought of kilometers ago.

716
01:13:31,201 --> 01:13:33,665
All those things I'm doing.

717
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:40,251
I thought about suicide,
but ...

718
01:13:41,692 --> 01:13:45,597
If I was going to cut somewhere in
that I would get confused.

719
01:13:51,462 --> 01:13:54,059
Grab the rope, honey.

720
01:14:29,361 --> 01:14:32,403
Teddy?
Sign up, Teddy.

721
01:14:35,238 --> 01:14:37,867
Bastard!

722
01:15:11,694 --> 01:15:14,013
This is the song, right?

723
01:15:16,227 --> 01:15:19,462
This is a fluke.
- It calls me.

724
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:22,450
Do not leave me.

725
01:15:26,026 --> 01:15:27,945
I do not.

726
01:15:30,415 --> 01:15:31,836
Walter ...

727
01:15:35,739 --> 01:15:38,353
How did you find anybody?

728
01:15:40,370 --> 01:15:42,089
I can not answer that.

729
01:15:45,298 --> 01:15:50,084
So you're our best friend
been with Teddy and me ...

730
01:15:50,085 --> 01:15:52,561
In all these years?

731
01:16:00,612 --> 01:16:02,800
Is not that amazing?

732
01:16:05,472 --> 01:16:08,344
Everything changes when you are deep in
your heart think you tomorrow

733
01:16:09,340 --> 01:16:12,007
maybe die.

734
01:16:13,354 --> 01:16:14,601
Are you sure?

735
01:16:16,816 --> 01:16:17,577
Yes.

736
01:16:21,129 --> 01:16:23,893
However small, these trees are.

737
01:16:51,346 --> 01:16:54,278
I can go beg in the end,
but you should just work.

738
01:16:55,468 --> 01:17:00,104
Do not like the others,
am not trying to persuade.

739
01:17:00,208 --> 01:17:03,154
I do not talk anymore.

740
01:17:11,983 --> 01:17:14,405
Do I stabbing you down?
- No.

741
01:17:14,883 --> 01:17:17,340
No, I want my blood on that knife.

742
01:17:17,671 --> 01:17:18,863
What do you want?

743
01:17:19,689 --> 01:17:21,445
You have to break my neck.

744
01:17:22,070 --> 01:17:23,525
I do not know how.

745
01:17:24,319 --> 01:17:26,238
You take down my neck, and turns.

746
01:17:26,304 --> 01:17:29,234
I'm not strong enough.
- Yes, you are, anyone can.

747
01:17:29,479 --> 01:17:31,980
But I do not.
- Somewhere inside you can.

748
01:17:32,816 --> 01:17:34,320
You must find your place in
that it can.

749
01:17:34,321 --> 01:17:38,283
Sorry Liz, but
find the place that it wants to do.

750
01:18:50,277 --> 01:18:51,368
Not stop!

751
01:18:53,900 --> 01:18:56,333
Please, oh, God.

752
01:19:07,557 --> 01:19:09,227
Walter!

753
01:19:15,223 --> 01:19:16,825
Walter ...

754
01:19:37,305 --> 01:19:40,371
I'm sorry, view the recording.

755
01:19:43,492 --> 01:19:47,709
<i> Melissa, I hope you forgive me. </i>

756
01:19:48,052 --> 01:19:50,590
<i> I've seen too much. </i>

757
01:19:50,636 --> 01:19:54,036
<i> It's time for me to go. </i>

758
01:19:55,522 --> 01:20:00,457
<i> I know you really
not want to see, it's just that </i>

759
01:20:00,458 --> 01:20:02,936
<i> the timeline I know ...</i>

760
01:20:04,187 --> 01:20:06,604
<i> I know you're here with me. </i>

761
01:20:07,338 --> 01:20:08,761
<i> Thus ...</i>

762
01:20:11,075 --> 01:20:12,431
<i> Stay with me. </i>

763
01:20:15,077 --> 01:20:17,267
<i>Do not look away . </i>

764
01:20:34,689 --> 01:20:35,748
<i> What's your name? </i>

765
01:20:37,336 --> 01:20:40,676
<i> My name is Walter. </i>

766
01:20:41,999 --> 01:20:43,289
<i> How do you feel now? </i>

767
01:20:46,662 --> 01:20:47,721
<i> lot better. </i>

768
01:20:49,393 --> 01:20:51,343
<i> My earliest memories as a child ...</i>

769
01:20:53,905 --> 01:20:56,637
<i> over the bars of my bed to climb </i>

770
01:20:57,489 --> 01:21:00,092
<i> to get out. </i>

771
01:21:03,497 --> 01:21:06,770
<i> talk in Hebrew ...</i>

772
01:21:15,185 --> 01:21:16,957
<i> Say ...</i>

773
01:21:18,743 --> 01:21:20,761
<i>Stop . </i>

774
01:21:28,138 --> 01:21:29,734
<i>Stop . </i>

775
01:21:32,395 --> 01:21:34,251
<i>Stop . </i>

776
01:21:36,939 --> 01:21:38,449
<i>Stop . </i>

777
01:22:22,409 --> 01:22:24,813
Where have you landed?

778
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:38,409
Teddy?

779
01:22:51,117 --> 01:22:52,732
Teddy?

780
01:23:06,671 --> 01:23:10,323
Teddy, can you hear me?

781
01:23:13,555 --> 01:23:19,144
Leave me here alone.
I'm trapped here and do not ...

782
01:23:19,145 --> 01:23:20,810
I do not ...

783
01:23:26,373 --> 01:23:28,688
If you had to go ...

784
01:23:29,482 --> 01:23:31,137
If you had to go ...

785
01:23:33,418 --> 01:23:35,821
Then you had me that morning
awake to make.

786
01:23:37,085 --> 01:23:39,702
I had gone with you.

787
01:23:49,888 --> 01:23:51,146
Melissa.

788
01:23:52,505 --> 01:23:54,692
I want you to know I'm here.

789
01:23:55,643 --> 01:24:00,715
Where?
- In the cave behind you.

790
01:24:05,215 --> 01:24:06,657
Going on the run?

791
01:24:09,038 --> 01:24:11,386
I would not run for you.

792
01:24:12,124 --> 01:24:13,436
Why not?

793
01:24:14,501 --> 01:24:18,463
With my sore leg I
You might have a chance.

794
01:24:20,416 --> 01:24:23,392
Will you kill me?
Here? Now?

795
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:25,608
Yes.

796
01:24:27,225 --> 01:24:30,878
Please, Daryl.
Should it do so much?

797
01:24:31,363 --> 01:24:32,528
Yes.

798
01:24:34,406 --> 01:24:35,993
Here we go.

799
01:24:41,781 --> 01:24:45,246
Melissa, are you there?

800
01:24:48,495 --> 01:24:50,942
I heard you on a
Somehow ...

801
01:24:53,168 --> 01:24:55,275
If you hear me, maybe ...

802
01:25:00,731 --> 01:25:03,873
I'm somewhere on the map
I do not know.

803
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:09,860
I can not read the coordinates ...

804
01:25:12,738 --> 01:25:15,582
I can not trust the coordinates.

805
01:25:20,840 --> 01:25:26,463
You think it ... but the trick is that no
an end to it.

806
01:25:28,803 --> 01:25:30,994
But here's the wind.

807
01:25:40,948 --> 01:25:42,399
Melissa ...

808
01:25:43,298 --> 01:25:44,818
Are you there?

809
01:25:46,902 --> 01:25:51,929
Are you asleep?
You lie somewhere to sleep without me?

810
01:25:55,005 --> 01:25:57,298
I hope you like the way
home find.

811
01:25:58,818 --> 01:25:59,635
Where it's hot ...

812
01:26:03,902 --> 01:26:05,753
and waiting for you.

813
01:26:07,213 --> 01:26:10,121
I hope you give us
Life can still remember.

814
01:26:13,493 --> 01:26:15,445
I hear the music now.

815
01:26:18,157 --> 01:26:20,637
And you will be at Walter ...

816
01:26:22,886 --> 01:26:25,464
Walter will be happy too.

817
01:26:30,495 --> 01:26:34,120
Do not think back to Brian.

818
01:26:35,103 --> 01:26:38,975
Imagine never where I am.

819
01:26:40,944 --> 01:26:44,033
And let no one a liar.

820
01:26:50,271 --> 01:26:52,553
And one day ..

821
01:26:53,191 --> 01:26:57,289
One day you will not
more of me thinking ...

822
01:26:59,035 --> 01:27:00,293
Not even for me to curse.

823
01:27:07,931 --> 01:27:09,784
I have loved you.

824
01:27:11,834 --> 01:27:14,811
Go home.

825
01:29:25,815 --> 01:29:26,907
Help.

826
01:29:28,924 --> 01:29:30,114
Someone ...

827
01:29:34,183 --> 01:29:36,066
Am I the only one here?

828
01:29:46,089 --> 01:29:49,429
No, sir, I am also.

829
01:29:49,694 --> 01:29:53,204
Who are you?
- I play the movies, of course.

830
01:29:53,398 --> 01:29:56,010
You must help me ...
Please, listen to me.

831
01:29:56,044 --> 01:29:57,265
Listen to me.
- I listen!

832
01:29:57,266 --> 01:29:58,486
There are others.
- Yes.

833
01:29:58,887 --> 01:30:02,242
I need help finding them.
You must understand, I left them behind.

834
01:30:02,253 --> 01:30:04,610
They no longer need your help.

835
01:30:06,690 --> 01:30:09,051
How do you know?
- Because I've seen.

836
01:30:11,721 --> 01:30:12,944
Is that so?

837
01:30:14,751 --> 01:30:16,006
Please ...

838
01:30:17,079 --> 01:30:18,038
What happened to her?

839
01:30:18,303 --> 01:30:20,915
Oh, Ms. Barnes?
I've just seen her.

840
01:30:20,949 --> 01:30:23,477
Did you know?
Is she here?

841
01:30:25,314 --> 01:30:27,298
Is it the end?

842
01:30:27,430 --> 01:30:30,010
Indeed, sir,
she has reached the end.

843
01:30:31,664 --> 01:30:34,574
But there are so many ends ...

844
01:30:37,848 --> 01:30:40,759
Enjoy your movies, Mr. Barnes.

845
01:30:47,704 --> 01:30:49,954
Sit down, sir!

846
01:31:15,883 --> 01:31:17,239
<i>Teddy  ...</i>

847
01:31:22,994 --> 01:31:24,681
<i> This is our house. </i>

848
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:28,683
<i> The grass is black. </i>

849
01:31:28,849 --> 01:31:31,726
