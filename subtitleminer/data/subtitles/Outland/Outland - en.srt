1
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
No way they're going to bring
those automated vacuum loaders here.

2
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
When they installed them on 1 4 and 23,
they said it was a temporary experiment.

3
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Well, they're still there.
Some temporary!

4
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Hand me that coupler, would you?

5
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
What about Wooton?
He's a shop steward. What'd he say?

6
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'll tell you what Wooton said.

7
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Zip. That's what he said.

8
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
They're always trying to pull something.

9
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
That's a lot of crap!

10
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
They've run a 7 worker shift since they
installed those loaders on 1 4 and 23.

11
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Hey, you read the contract.
8 workers per shift.

12
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
That's what it says. Eight.
In black and white.

13
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So they want to get cute,
I can get cute, too.

14
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I want a meeting.
Maybe we need a new shop steward.

15
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Bylaws are bylaws.
Can't they regulate these suits?

16
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's minus 1 75 degrees.

17
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
We broil our asses off.

18
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
-Where's your other suit?
-In the shop.

19
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Put some Mylar over the sensor.

20
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It steps down the heating coil
and you'll be cooler.

21
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Really?

22
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
No, moron, I made it up.

23
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Oh, God!

24
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I hate spiders!

25
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Kill it!

26
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Kill it!

27
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Hey, Tarlow, what's eating you?

28
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Get it off! Get it off my leg!

29
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Somebody please help me!

30
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Tarlow, what's the matter with you?
Get what off?

31
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Spider! Please help me! Get it off!

32
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Spider? Have you popped your cork?

33
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
How can there be a spider here?
There's nothing alive here.

34
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Get it off! Oh, get it off! Oh, God!

35
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Very funny.

36
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
We're not falling for nothing.
Cut the garbage and get back to work.

37
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Oh, God, it's getting inside!

38
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Get it out! Get it out!

39
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Somebody please help me!

40
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Somebody help me get it out of my suit!

41
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Is it the buttermilk kind?

42
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I'm afraid so.

43
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
They were running out of the other kind.

44
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I can hardly talk with these braces.

45
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It won't be much longer.

46
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
-How much longer?
-Pretty soon.

47
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
How soon?

48
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
-How soon for what?
-Till I get my braces off.

49
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
-You want crooked teeth?
-I don't mind them.

50
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You'll be missing some teeth
in a minute if you don't eat breakfast.

51
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Pretend it's not buttermilk.

52
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Pretend I ate them.

53
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Marshal, it's Lowell.
The night watch went okay.

54
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Nothing much.
Just a couple of drunks.

55
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
We'll watch it tonight.

56
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
That's it.
I'll be in your office at 18:00.

57
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Marshal, it's Montone.
Nothing more on that incident...

58
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
...in the mine yesterday.
Some guy went whacko.

59
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
The Company's shipping the body back,
or what's left, on today's shuttle.

60
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's impossible to do an autopsy.
You should have seen that mess!

61
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Anyway, definitely no homicide.

62
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
There were two witnesses
when it happened.

63
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It happens every once
in a while up here.

64
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Some people let this place get to them.

65
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
So, that's about it.

66
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Tell your wife that Transportation
got the tickets for her.

67
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'll see you
when you get to the office.

68
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And don 't worry,
you'll get used to it.

69
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
What tickets?

70
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Mr. and Mrs. Reynolds,
the nice couple from the bakery.

71
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
They wanted tickets
for the weekly shuttle for a friend.

72
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
So I said I'd see what I could do.

73
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Well, I'd better go.
See you for dinner, sport.

74
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
-And remember, 7 pages of math.
-I promise.

75
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
-You be good today.
-I will.

76
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Look, I know this is a lousy assignment.

77
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
And I know what it is for you.
How difficult.

78
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Just give it a chance.
It won't be so bad.

79
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I know.

80
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I love you.

81
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I love you, too.

82
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
We've only been here two weeks.
It'll get better. I promise.

83
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
l got to go.
You smell good.

84
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
And finally,
I realize that I'm new here. . .

85
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
. . .and I've got to get to know you,
and you've got to get to know me.

86
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I just hope that I can
justify your confidence.

87
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Thank you.

88
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
-I really wowed them.
-Had them eating out of your hand.

89
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Are there any questions?

90
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Marshal?

91
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Flo Spector. . .

92
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
. . .Accounting Services.

93
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I'm sure I speak for all of us. . .

94
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
. . .in extending our welcome
to you and your family.

95
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
If Mrs. O'Niel or your son should need
anything, tell them to call me.

96
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Thank you very much.

97
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'll be sure and tell my wife.
Her name is Carol.

98
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I see there are no more questions.

99
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I add my welcome to Marshal O'Niel.

100
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I'm sure we all agree
he'll have a pleasant tour.

101
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Right now,
he's just getting started here.

102
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Soon he'll see that this
is like every other mining town.

103
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
-There's never much trouble.
-I'm glad to hear it.

104
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Just remember that these men
and women work hard. Very hard.

105
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Since I've been the general manager,
we've broken all productivity records.

106
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
We're becoming the leading
Con-Amalgamate operation.

107
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
And everyone in this room has
received the bonus checks to prove it.

108
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Good work only comes
from contented people.

109
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I work these people hard. . .

110
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
. . .and I let them play hard.

111
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
When it comes time
for them to let off steam. . .

112
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
. . .you have to allow them some room.

113
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Long as no harm's done,
just give them a little room.

114
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Understand what I'm saying, Marshal?

115
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Thanks for the advice, Mr. Sheppard.

116
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
We're all professionals.

117
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I'm sure we are.

118
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Drop by my office.

119
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
We'll talk some more.

120
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I'll do that.

121
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Don't get your nose out of joint.

122
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
What was that all about?

123
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
-It's just his way.
-I don't like his way.

124
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
-Don't mess with him.
-He's an asshole.

125
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
A very powerful asshole.
Don't mess with him.

126
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
He's just trying to sniff you out.

127
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
The last marshal kept things
running smooth. That's all they want.

128
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Things run smooth,
they make their money.

129
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Nobody's here for their health, and they
certainly aren't here for the scenery.

130
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
What is that guy doing?

131
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
He's going in the elevator!

132
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
He's going in the elevator
without a suit on!

133
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Carol?

134
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I'm trying to keep my composure.

135
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
And like everything I do,
I think I'm messing this up.

136
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I despise these message things.
I'm just such a coward.

137
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I couldn 't look at your face and say
what I'm about to say. I just couldn 't.

138
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
If you were in front of me,
I'd change my mind.

139
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
And I don 't want to change my mind.

140
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I love you.
Please know that.

141
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I hadn 't planned this.

142
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I really hadn 't.

143
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I just can 't take it anymore.
That's what it amounts to.

144
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I know we've been over this
so many times before.

145
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
The same crying from me,
and the same assurances from you.

146
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
That the next place will be different.
But it never is. It can 't be.

147
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
So yesterday,
something snapped in me.

148
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I just couldn 't bear to see Paulie...

149
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
...clatter around yet another
bleak place. I just couldn 't.

150
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
He's a child.
He's never set foot on Earth.

151
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Never!

152
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
He looks at pictures
and reads books of Earth...

153
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
...all day long. And he hides them
from you so your feelings won 't be hurt.

154
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Don 't you see he deserves a childhood?

155
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
He deserves a chance
to breathe air, real outside air...

156
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
... where you don 't broil or explode.

157
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Air that smells like life!

158
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Not like a ventilating unit!

159
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I'm just not as good as you are.

160
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I don 't think it's worth it.

161
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
So I'm taking Paulie back home.

162
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I love you.

163
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
You don 't deserve this.
You deserve the best.

164
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I've just got to go now, my love.
I'll contact you...

165
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
...in a few days from the space station
before we finally leave for Earth.

166
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
What do we have here?
What's happening with the purser's area?

167
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
We've put monitors
on the whole area for 36 hours. . .

168
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
. . .and things have been quiet.

169
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Keep the monitors on for two weeks.

170
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
-And the detonators?
-They were found.

171
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Where?

172
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I don't know.
The foreman reported them found. . .

173
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
. . .then told me to forget about it.

174
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Nelson, we're talking about
nuclear detonators.

175
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
You just don't lose them
and then find them.

176
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
You lose your comb, then find it.

177
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Not detonators.

178
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I want to know where they were found
and who found them. Get it?

179
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Good for you, Nelson.

180
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Slater, what about the incident
in the mine elevator?

181
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Nothing much to tell, Sarge.

182
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Some cupcake named Cane decided
he didn't need an environment suit.

183
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
They're still sponging him
off the elevator walls.

184
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
He was alone. Nobody near enough
to have thrown him in.

185
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Some guys tried
to get into the airlock. . .

186
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
. . .except he'd sealed it.

187
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
No way it was homicide.

188
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
-Had to have been a suicide.
-Did he leave a note?

189
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I beg your pardon?

190
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Did he leave a note?

191
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
None that we know of, sir.

192
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Then how do you know it was suicide?

193
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
There's no other explanation.

194
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
He knew what he was doing,
that's for sure.

195
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
You can't fall into an airlock
and then an elevator.

196
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
You have to open hatches,
press buttons, close hatches.

197
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
It's the only explanation.

198
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Thank you.

199
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Okay. Fanning.

200
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
-What about the pump station?
-Just a fight.

201
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
We took them both in to cool off.
They straightened out soon.

202
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
-Gil?
-Pretty quiet.

203
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Couple of calls about noise.
Nothing much.

204
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Who ordered all these pressure packs?
This is a mine, not a war.

205
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
-You did, doctor.
-I said 1 00. Not 1 ,000.

206
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I said 1 00, which can't be mistaken
for anything except 1 00.

207
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
It doesn't sound remotely
Iike 1 ,000. Listen!

208
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
You'll hear what I mean.
One thousand.

209
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
One hundred.

210
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Totally different.

211
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
You think they sound the same?
Who are you, anyway?

212
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Are you Dr. Lazarus?

213
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Two aspirins and call me in the morning.
Doctor joke. Are you the new marshal?

214
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Yes. I'd like to talk to you.

215
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I got an alibi. Four people will swear
we were playing poker.

216
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I never heard that one before.

217
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
-That's really funny.
-Sorry.

218
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Yesterday, a man went into the
atmosphere without his pressure suit.

219
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
A couple of days before, another
man cut his suit open on purpose.

220
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
It happens here.

221
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
How often?

222
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
-I don't know. It just happens here.
-Why?

223
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I'm not a psychiatrist.
I can't tell you why.

224
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Some people can't take it
here after awhile.

225
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
-Did you do autopsies?
-No.

226
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Why not?

227
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
The Company wanted the bodies
shipped out quickly.

228
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Secondly, when one exposes
himself to zero-pressure atmosphere. . .

229
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
. . .there isn't a lot to inspect.

230
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
In the third place,
you're becoming a nuisance.

231
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Yes, I know.

232
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Give me a report of all of the incidents
happening over the past 6 months.

233
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I'd like it soon, or I might just kick
your nasty ass all over this floor.

234
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
That's a marshal joke.

235
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
It's open.

236
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I didn't know what you'd like to eat,
so I brought everything.

237
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Listen, you got to eat something.

238
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Can't catch crooks
on an empty stomach.

239
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I know how you feel. I do.

240
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
The second time I did a tour,
my wife had skipped off. . .

241
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
. . .with some computer programmer.

242
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I have two daughters.

243
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
They call the programmer daddy.

244
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
My wife said she was happy.

245
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I said, ""Happy?
The guy looks so boring. ""

246
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
She said he was not Mr. Excitement,
but he was always home.

247
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
You can't argue with that.

248
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Try the food, it's not bad.

249
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I will.

250
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
The hookers are nice.

251
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
They can help when you're lonely.

252
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I'm sure.

253
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I get the feeling I'm bombing.

254
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
No, you're not. I appreciate
what you're doing. I really do.

255
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
No, it's just. . .

256
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
. . .I'd like to be on my own for now.

257
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I understand.

258
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Marshal. . .

259
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
. . .if you need anything. . .

260
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
. . .if you just want to talk. . .

261
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
. . .please call me.

262
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
We've got a response on your request.

263
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I'm trying to keep my composure...

264
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
...and like everything else I do,
I think I'm messing this up.

265
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I despise these message things.
I'm just such a coward.

266
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I couldn 't look at your face and say
what I'm about to say. I just couldn 't.

267
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
If you were in front of me,
I'd change my mind.

268
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
What?

269
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
How bad?

270
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I'll be right there.

271
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Marshal, he's in the west wing.
Sergeant Montone is waiting for you.

272
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
He's in a leisure compartment roughing
up a hooker. She pushed the alarm.

273
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
When I responded, he said he had a knife
and would kill her if I didn't leave.

274
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
A crane operator named Sagan. Been
here 1 1 months, never caused trouble.

275
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
-How's the girl?
-She's still alive.

276
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Is he stoned?

277
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Beats me. Some guys like
to slap hookers around.

278
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:04,000
This is Marshal O'Niel. Let that girl
out and no one's going to hurt you.

279
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Now listen to me!

280
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Just listen.
I can't go away and you know that.

281
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Now nobody's going to hurt you.

282
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
If you want to talk, we'll talk.

283
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I won't try to break in. . .

284
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
. . .and you don't do anything crazy
with that girl. Okay?

285
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Go away!

286
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
-Get me a maintenance worker.
-Yes, sir.

287
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Which vent leads to the air conditioning
duct for number two compartment?

288
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Open it.

289
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Open the hydraulic valves to release
the door locks when I tell you.

290
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Sagan, can you hear me?

291
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I hear you!

292
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I'll explain this to you. . .

293
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
. . .very carefully.

294
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I will release the hydraulic pressure
on the door locks.

295
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
It will open this door.

296
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
You cannot keep the doors closed. . .

297
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
. . .and stay in.

298
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Why don't you just come out
and make it easy?

299
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
The second that door opens,
I'll kill her!

300
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I'm going to slice her!

301
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I hate her!

302
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I won't argue with you.

303
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
And I won't trick you.

304
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I'm going to count
down from ten to one.

305
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
At one, the door
will spring open slowly.

306
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
I will not rush in.

307
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I will not shoot you.

308
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I don't want to hurt anybody,
including you.

309
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Whatever the problem is. . .

310
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
. . .we can work it out,
without hurting anybody.

311
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
You're going to kill me.

312
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
No, I'm not.
You have my word.

313
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
You also have my word
that if you kill that girl. . .

314
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
. . .I will kill you.

315
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Now I'm going to count down
from ten. . .

316
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
. . .to one, slowly.

317
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Just do as I say.

318
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Ten. . .

319
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
. . .nine. . .

320
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Well, he turned.
I saw the knife.

321
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Jaw looks broken.
Maybe the nose.

322
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Contusions.
Neck wounds look superficial.

323
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Jesus Christ,
who did this to her?

324
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
A worker. Went nuts.

325
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
It happens here, remember?

326
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I got that list.
She's bleeding in the abdomen.

327
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
-Why didn't you bring it to my office?
-I don't make house calls.

328
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
She'll be all right?

329
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Maybe, if you let me do my job.

330
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
28 in the last 6 months.

331
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I wonder in the 6 months before.

332
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
24. I've got initiative.

333
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Good for you.

334
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
You want to know how many
in the 6 months before that? Two.

335
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Are you sure?

336
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I'm unpleasant, not stupid.
Of course I'm sure, I can count.

337
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
-Well, what do you think?
-I don't know.

338
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Almost nobody has both oars
in the water, as far as I'm concerned.

339
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Why people start to lose their marbles
in greater numbers isn't so mystifying.

340
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
I don't know why more of them
didn't do it sooner.

341
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Where are the bodies sent?

342
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
They usually ship them out
on the next shuttle.

343
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
They wrap them up and jettison
them halfway to the station.

344
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Burial at sea and all that crap.

345
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Lazarus? This is O 'Niel.
I'll see you in the hospital right away.

346
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Do you know what time it is?

347
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
You'd better be dying.

348
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
-Is this going to take long?
-You're kidding me.

349
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
That doesn't mean much.
Blood type, cholesterol count.

350
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
This blood is from a dead person.

351
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Very good.

352
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
No alcohol.

353
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
He ate dinner.

354
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Protein, carbohydrates. . .

355
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
. . .more carbohydrates.

356
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
He didn't eat his vegetables.

357
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
No nicotine.

358
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Some tranquilizers.

359
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Yeah, they're Company tranquilizers.
Standard issue.

360
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Blood sugar and hemoglobin are normal.

361
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
-Hello.
-What?

362
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I don't know.

363
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Shit.

364
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Such a smart piece of equipment,
and a wreck like me trying to run it.

365
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
You know, you haven't
your medical all-star here.

366
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Company doctors are like ships' doctors.

367
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Most are one shuttle flight ahead
of a malpractice suit.

368
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Something's there, isn't it?

369
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Maybe.

370
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I spend my days dispensing
tranquilizers to the workers. . .

371
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
. . .and certifying that the prostitutes
don't have syphilis.

372
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I don't know
how to analyze a new molecule.

373
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Hello.

374
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Is it a drug?

375
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
You just won a prize.

376
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
It's some kind of narcotic.

377
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Nothing I've ever seen before.

378
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Synthetic.

379
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Bingo.

380
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Polydichloric Euthimal.

381
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Those stupid bastards
are taking Polydichloric Euthimal!

382
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
It's an amphetamine.
Strongest thing you ever saw.

383
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Makes you feel wonderful.

384
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
You do 1 4 hours of work in 6 hours.
That kind of nonsense.

385
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Especially manual labor.
It makes you work like a horse.

386
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,000
The Army tested it a few years ago.
It made everybody work all right.

387
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Then it made them psychotic.

388
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
It takes a while,
ten, maybe eleven months.

389
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
And then it fries your brain.

390
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,000
You said it's synthetic.
Can it be made here?

391
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
No. Impossible.

392
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
It has to have been shipped in.

393
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
No autopsies.

394
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
So nobody knows anything.

395
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
The workers are producing more,
so the Company's making bigger profits.

396
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
They're not about to ask any questions.

397
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
It's quite a setup.

398
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Don't say anything
to anybody about this.

399
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I did good, didn't I?

400
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
For a wreck.

401
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
You did good.

402
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
9 - 7.

403
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Do you want to tell me about it?

404
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Tell you about what?

405
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Sheppard.

406
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
What about him?

407
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
How deep are you in?

408
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Not too deep.

409
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
I'm paid to look the other way.

410
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
You don't do anything bad,
you just don't do anything good.

411
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
I'm going to bust Sheppard.

412
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Are you serious?

413
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
This is no place for heroes.
You try to bust him. . .

414
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
. . .you're messing
with more than you think.

415
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
You're talking about
the general manager.

416
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
He's a real hotshot here.

417
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,000
It's big money, people and places
that we only know from letterheads.

418
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
This guy is connected with more
than just the Company.

419
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
I mean it.
There's some serious stuff involved.

420
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
What will this prove?

421
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:25,000
I'm not trying to prove anything.
That stuff they sell is killing people.

422
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
What will you do with me?

423
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
I don't know.

424
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
You want me to resign?

425
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:42,000
No. Just don't come between Sheppard
and me. Just keep taking your money. . .

426
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
. . .and looking the other way.

427
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
I don't want you.

428
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
I want him.

429
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Your serve.

430
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Think it over.

431
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
He's in cell 36.

432
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
-Has he said anything?
-Not a peep.

433
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Anyone ask about him?

434
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
If anyone does,
I want to know.

435
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
This is O'Niel.

436
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,000
The report says you were carrying
4 ounces of Euthimal. . .

437
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
. . .which is 400 doses.

438
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

439
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Of course you don't.

440
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
How much does Sheppard pay you?

441
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

442
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,000
You'll love it here, though some
start to go crazy at night. . .

443
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
. . .when you can't feel the floor.

444
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,000
And sometimes the air tether
gets knotted and a man suffocates.

445
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
But that doesn't happen too often.

446
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
O'Niel, piss off!

447
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
I like that.

448
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
You're real quick with a comeback.

449
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
I've got you nailed.

450
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
I've got witnesses and evidence.

451
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:17,000
You'll be shipped back and do time that
will make this place look like a picnic!

452
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Now don't do a deal with me.
Don't get yourself a reduced sentence.

453
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Just do your hard time
while Sheppard laughs his ass off.

454
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,000
I've got to hand it to you.
You're pretty sharp.

455
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
See you around, tough guy.

456
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Nobody talks to him.
Nobody touches him.

457
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
I mean nobody, you understand?

458
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
I understand.

459
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:01,000
You know something? I can hit
a seven iron 500 yards in this place.

460
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Fix yourself a drink.

461
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
No, thanks.

462
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
You've been busy.

463
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
So have you.

464
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
How much do you want?

465
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
How much?

466
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Just what we need here,
a goddamn hero.

467
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
You know something?
This rug has a slight break to the left.

468
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Let me tell you what you're
dealing with. I run a franchise.

469
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:33,000
I'm hired to dig as much ore
as possible out of this hellhole.

470
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:37,000
There's a guy like me on every
mining operation all over this system.

471
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,000
My hookers are clean,
some good-looking.

472
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
My booze isn't watered.
The workers are happy.

473
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:47,000
When the workers are happy, they dig
more ore. They get more bonus money.

474
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
When they dig more ore,
the Company's happy.

475
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
When the Company's happy,
I'm happy.

476
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
-Sounds wonderful.
-Nothing here is wonderful.

477
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
It works. That's enough.

478
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Now every year a new marshal
comes to start his tour.

479
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,000
They all know the score. You know
the score. You're no different.

480
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,000
If this hero routine is to get
your price up, I'll think about it.

481
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
What are you after?

482
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
You.

483
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
What is it with guys like you?

484
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
If you were such a goddamn super-cop. . .

485
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
. . .what are you doing on
a Company mining operating like Io?

486
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:32,000
They didn't send you here as a reward
for your sterling service.

487
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
You know that and I know that.

488
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
I read your record.

489
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
You've got a big mouth.

490
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
That's why you're sent
from one toilet to the next.

491
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Me? I don't plan on spending
the rest of my life doing this.

492
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Well, good for you.

493
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Now, look, this charade
of yours is silly.

494
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,000
You meddle, I want you to know
what you're meddling with.

495
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
You got something to prove,
prove it to yourself, not to me.

496
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
I'll see you around.

497
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,000
If you're looking for money,
you're smarter than you look!

498
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
If you're not,
you're a lot dumber.

499
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
I'm probably a lot dumber.

500
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
That can be very dangerous.

501
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
All right, tough guy, time to talk.

502
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
What's the matter?
Sun in your eyes?

503
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Well, well, well, if it isn't the law!

504
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Sheppard, guess what
I just found in a meat locker?

505
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:39,000
You know, I have a feeling that
you'll tell me even if I don't guess.

506
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:43,000
250 pounds of hamburger
named Yario that works for you.

507
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,000
I also found your shipment of PDE.

508
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,000
I threw the hamburger in jail
and the PDE in the toilet.

509
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Or the other way around?
I can't remember.

510
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,000
You've been busy.

511
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Yeah, are you proud of me?

512
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Real proud.

513
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Good shot.

514
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,000
You destroyed the shipment?

515
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
You do have a flair for the dramatic.

516
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Was it expensive?

517
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
More than you can ever imagine.

518
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
You could be out of business.

519
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:22,000
You know, I've misjudged you.
You're not stupid. You're crazy.

520
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
You think you caused
an inconvenience?

521
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Is that what you think?

522
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Why don't you go home
and polish your badge?

523
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,000
You're dealing with grownups here.
You're out of your league.

524
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Whoever sent that shipment
will be mad that you lost it.

525
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Grownups have no sense of humor.

526
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:43,000
I'd play a firm eight iron there.
Just swing easy.

527
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
You're dead.

528
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Do you hear me?

529
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
I hear you.

530
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Bello ws, this is Sheppard.

531
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,000
What the hell's been
going on down there?

532
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Just a little trouble. I can take care
of it. Send me a few of your best men.

533
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,000
And the two you had?

534
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Send me the men!
I'll straighten everything out.

535
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
My people are not going to like this.

536
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,000
-I'll have it straightened out.
-When do you need the men?

537
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,000
On the next shuttle.

538
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:28,000
I'll see what I can do.
I'll call you back later.

539
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,000
What have we got?

540
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Break-in at the women's quarters.

541
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Can't tell if it was
a pervert or a burglary.

542
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
The guy was surprised
and ran like hell.

543
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
-Any prints?
-Nothing clear.

544
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,000
-What else?
-Not much.

545
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,000
A hell of a fight in the cafeteria.

546
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
A broken nose and teeth
was the damage.

547
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Both guys are cooling out in the tank.

548
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Where's your sergeant stripes?

549
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Well, it's only been a couple
of days since Sergeant Montone--

550
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:02,000
You're the new sergeant.
You wear your stripes. Put them on now.

551
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,000
This is Bello ws. You've got
the men you want and it wasn 't easy.

552
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
My people are very unhappy.

553
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:50,000
This could cause trouble for us
on the other operations.

554
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:54,000
If the Company got wind of what's
going on, they'd clamp down like a vise.

555
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
They can 't afford
to lose their franchise.

556
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,000
It could put my people out of business.
And my people like being in business.

557
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Tell them not to worry.

558
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
How good are the men?

559
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
The best. They've left
on the shuttle arriving Sunday.

560
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
-They have their own weapons?
-Yes.

561
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
The target is O 'Niel.

562
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
-You better not mess this up!
-I won 't.

563
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,000
-It's your party.
-Yes, it is.

564
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
-How much help will he have?
-None.

565
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
-You sure?
-Yes, I'm sure.

566
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,000
No one here will stick
their neck out for anyone.

567
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Once word spreads that
these guys are pros...

568
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,000
... there'll be no trouble.

569
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
I've got someone on the inside
who 'll spread the word.

570
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Don 't worry.
He's a dead man.

571
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
I'll tell you,
if this doesn 't work out...

572
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
... the next guys who come
will be coming for you.

573
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
No sweat.
I'll call you when it's over.

574
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
How many can I count on?

575
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Well, I don't know, sir.

576
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,000
What about you?

577
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Well, you see. . .

578
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,000
. . .most of us are. . .

579
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,000
. . .most are young.

580
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,000
-We have families.
-I have a family.

581
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
I know where we stand.

582
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Thank you, sergeant.

583
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:58,000
That's pretty good.
Playing by yourself and losing.

584
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:03,000
I'd join you in this dumb game
if I could play sitting down.

585
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Yes, I'm well, thank you.

586
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Pretty busy.

587
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Seems there's
some flu going around.

588
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:15,000
You'd be surprised how many workers
will be sick this Sunday.

589
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,000
It's your actual epidemic.

590
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Are you going to be sick
this Sunday?

591
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,000
If you want sterling character,
you're in the wrong place.

592
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:34,000
If you're the guy you're supposed to be,
you wouldn't stick around.

593
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,000
-That's why they sent you.
-Maybe they made a mistake.

594
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
I was afraid you'd say
something like that.

595
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:45,000
You really think
you're making a difference?

596
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Then why, for God's sake?

597
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Because. . .

598
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
. . .maybe they are right.

599
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:58,000
They send me here to this pile of shit
because they think I belong here.

600
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,000
I want to find out. . .

601
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
. . .if they're right.

602
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:11,000
A whole machine works because
everybody does what they're supposed to.

603
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,000
And I found out. . .

604
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:19,000
. . .I was supposed
to be something I didn't like.

605
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:23,000
That's what's in the program.

606
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:27,000
That's my rotten little part,
in the rotten machine.

607
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
I don't like it.

608
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:36,000
So I'm going to find out
if they're right.

609
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
Your wife is one stupid lady.

610
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
You want to go get drunk?

611
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:59,000
At least you have some sense left.

612
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Hello, there.

613
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
I'm doing it again.

614
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:38,000
I've had so much time
to prepare what to say...

615
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:42,000
...and here I am looking at your face,
and my mouth has gone to mush.

616
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,000
How's Paul?

617
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
He's fine. I promised him...

618
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
...he could talk to you.
He's in the next room.

619
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Are you well?

620
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,000
I'm okay.

621
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,000
Paulie and I....

622
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,000
The reservations have come through.
We're flying home.

623
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,000
The reservations are for three.

624
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,000
That was thoughtful.

625
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,000
I can't.

626
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Why?

627
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
I just can't.

628
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,000
I wish I could.

629
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,000
What is so important?

630
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
I'm too tired to try to explain.

631
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,000
You're making a difference?

632
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Do you think what you're doing
is worth giving up your family for?

633
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
You're a stubborn son of a bitch.

634
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Something's wrong there, isn 't it?

635
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,000
No.

636
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:50,000
I know you're in some kind of trouble.

637
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,000
When you speak in sentences...

638
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
...of less than two words,
you're in trouble. I know it.

639
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
I'm okay.

640
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Damn you.

641
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Take care of yourself.

642
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
You can come in now, Paulie.

643
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,000
I love you.

644
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Hi, Paul. How are you doing?

645
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Great!

646
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Mommy let me stay up late because
this is when the call came through.

647
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,000
I miss you.

648
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,000
I miss you, too.

649
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Mommy says as soon as you get done,
you'll come home with us.

650
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
As soon as I get done.

651
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,000
What's it like on Earth?

652
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,000
It's beautiful.

653
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:47,000
You're going to see
many wonderful things.

654
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
And you'll have friends to play with.

655
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Mommy says that on the flight, they
put you to sleep for more than a year.

656
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,000
That's true.

657
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Will it hurt?

658
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Not a bit. You'll just wake up. . .

659
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,000
. . .and be home.

660
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
I'm going to sleep through my birthday.

661
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Next birthday,
I'll get you two presents.

662
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Can 't you come home with us?

663
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Not right now.

664
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Soon?

665
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Soon.

666
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,000
I love you, Daddy.

667
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:26,000
I love you too, Paul.

668
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
You take care of Mommy.

669
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
I will.

670
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
See you, Daddy.

671
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
I could use a little help.

672
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,000
I thought so.

673
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:26,000
You should protect us.

674
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
You're the police. It's your job.

675
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Where are your men?

676
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:32,000
My men?

677
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
My men are shit.

678
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Jesus, take it easy!

679
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,000
What are you doing here?

680
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:44,000
I went to your office to offer help.
I saw you on the screen.

681
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,000
You're heading right for them.

682
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,000
You're in terrific shape.

683
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:52,000
They've missed the artery.
I'll stop the bleeding.

684
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,000
Which way were they heading?

685
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:05,000
They were going to the operations wing.
They're trying to cut you off.

686
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:09,000
Could you seal off the access ways
in the east quadrant?

687
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
I'll go out around them.

688
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,000
Thank you.

689
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:34,000
Don't misconstrue.
I'm not displaying character. . .

690
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
. . .just temporary insanity.

691
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:09,000
I'm going outside.
Now get the hell out of here.

692
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:11,000
I can help.

693
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:13,000
Don't argue with me!

694
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Seal the access corridors. . .

695
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
. . .and lead them into C-5.

696
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
Don't get maudlin.

697
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:53,000
Can I help?

698
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Terrific. Here comes the cavalry.
You're a bit late.

699
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
-Is the marshal all right?
-So far.

700
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:02,000
Where is he?

701
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Outside somewhere.

702
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Outside where?

703
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:09,000
How the hell should I know?
Maybe in the greenhouse.

704
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:23,000
Oh, fuck it.

705
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:05,000
How's the arm?

706
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
It's all right.

707
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:16,000
I was on my way to drinking myself into
a stupor and I thought I'd say goodbye.

708
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:23,000
You were a good friend.

709
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:25,000
Thank you.

710
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:30,000
Thank you. There hasn't been so much
excitement in this heap for some time.

711
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:36,000
Well, I have to go now.

712
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:42,000
Me too. It's going to hit the fan around
here and I want to watch it happen.

713
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:45,000
You did good.

714
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,000
So did you.

715
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:52,000
Damn right.

716
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000

GELULA & CO., INC.

717
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
In a mining town...

718
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
...on the second moon of Jupiter...

719
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
...something deadly is happening.

720
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:15,000
Pretty soon you'll see that this is
just like every other mining town.

721
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
I work these people hard. . .

722
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:21,000
. . .and I let them play hard.
There's never much trouble.

723
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
We're all professionals.

724
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:25,000
I'm sure we are.

725
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
We've only been here 2 weeks.

726
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
It'll get better.
I promise.

727
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:36,000
Nothing more on that mine incident.
It looks like some guy just went wacko.

728
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:39,000
-It happens here.
-How often?

729
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
I don't know.
It just happens here.

730
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:43,000
Why?

731
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:46,000
I'm not a psychiatrist.
I can't tell you why.

732
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
Some people can't take it here
after awhile.

733
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
What's that guy think he's doing?

734
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:54,000
No way it could've been homicide.

735
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
Had to have been a suicide.

736
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:00,000
28 in the last six months.

737
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:02,000
Did you do autopsies?

738
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:04,000
No.

739
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:06,000
Then how do you know
that it was a suicide?

740
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:10,000
There's no other explanation.

741
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:17,000
When one is exposed to zero pressure,
there isn't a whole lot left to inspect.

742
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:19,000
Something's there, isn't it?

743
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:22,000
Maybe.

744
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
Try and meddle, I want you to know
what you're meddling with.

745
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
You're out of your league.

746
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:33,000
You know, we're grownups here.

747
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:38,000
Bingo.

748
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:39,000
Marshal. . .

749
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:41,000
. . .you're dead.

750
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
If you're the kind of guy
you're supposed to be. . .

751
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:48,000
. . .you wouldn't stick around.
That's why they sent you here.

752
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
Maybe they made a mistake.

753
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:16,000
Outland.
The ultimate enemy is still. ..

754
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
...man.
