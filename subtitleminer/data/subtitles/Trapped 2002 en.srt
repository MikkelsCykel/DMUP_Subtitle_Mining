00:01:06,569 --> 00:01:08,161
Hello.

2
00:01:08,329 --> 00:01:12,561
Good, good. You counted it?
Okay.

3
00:01:12,769 --> 00:01:15,681
Yeah, l just spoke to him. He's cool.

4
00:01:19,609 --> 00:01:21,884
Where's Peter?

5
00:01:24,369 --> 00:01:27,520
You killed him, didn't you?

6
00:01:27,969 --> 00:01:32,326
You killed him.
And you're gonna kill me.

7
00:01:32,489 --> 00:01:35,925
Well, you are making it
awfully tempting.

8
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:40,886
Listen, Mary, l want you to know...

9
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:45,165
...that l really enjoyed
the last 24 hours.

10
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:48,162
And that includes our little party.

11
00:01:57,089 --> 00:01:59,603
Marvin, are you in place?

12
00:01:59,769 --> 00:02:01,646
All right.

13
00:02:01,809 --> 00:02:04,084
Just wait a minute,
and then do it.

14
00:02:04,289 --> 00:02:05,358
You said do it!

15
00:02:06,969 --> 00:02:12,123
You don't want to blow it now, do you?
We've come so far together.

16
00:02:12,289 --> 00:02:14,883
Remember what we talked about?

17
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:19,879
l remember. l won't tell. l promise
l won't tell. l won't tell anyone.

18
00:02:20,049 --> 00:02:21,607
Guess what?

19
00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:25,920
He's in the playground
right behind me.

20
00:02:26,089 --> 00:02:28,205
Where? Where?

21
00:02:28,369 --> 00:02:29,802
Goodbye, Mary.

22
00:02:54,609 --> 00:02:56,042
Peter.

23
00:02:58,529 --> 00:02:59,723
Peter.

24
00:03:02,689 --> 00:03:06,568
Peter! Peter! Come here.

25
00:03:15,449 --> 00:03:18,805
Twenty-three hours and 20 minutes,
Joey.

26
00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:22,442
Yeah, you did good, Marvin.

27
00:03:26,329 --> 00:03:29,560
Do we have to do this again?

28
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:39,842
l wonder if l'm gonna miss
bringing families together.

29
00:04:54,449 --> 00:04:56,565
You got it?

30
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:59,004
Come here. Don't go.

31
00:04:59,369 --> 00:05:02,281
This is for both of us, okay?
And for Abby.

32
00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:06,806
She's growing up so fast. l don't
want you to miss anything important.

33
00:05:06,969 --> 00:05:11,042
l know. l know. lt's almost over.
Last time.

34
00:05:11,209 --> 00:05:14,645
-When are you gonna take me for a ride?
-Well...

35
00:05:14,809 --> 00:05:17,881
...l booked a cabin up at Whistler
this weekend.

36
00:05:18,049 --> 00:05:19,926
Yes!

37
00:05:20,769 --> 00:05:22,646
-You did?
-l did.

38
00:05:22,849 --> 00:05:24,328
Okay.

39
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:33,207
-Abby, are you all right?
-Yeah, l was just looking at crabs.

40
00:05:34,369 --> 00:05:36,519
Daddy, don't worry so much.

41
00:05:36,729 --> 00:05:40,608
Yeah, Daddy, don't worry so much.
We'll be fine.

42
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:48,247
-You look after Mommy, okay?
-Okay.

43
00:05:51,729 --> 00:05:56,564
-Will you wiggle your wings after takeoff?
-Better watch and see.

44
00:05:57,169 --> 00:06:02,323
Wiggle your wings? lt's waggle your wings,
not wiggle your wings.

45
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:26,566
He did it.
He wiggled his wings.

46
00:06:43,409 --> 00:06:45,764
-l wanna do it.
-Yeah?

47
00:06:45,929 --> 00:06:50,525
Okay. Take all the trash mail
out for me.

48
00:06:50,689 --> 00:06:55,968
-All that mail that we keep getting.
-Always trash.

49
00:07:00,569 --> 00:07:02,719
-All junk.
-All junk?

50
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:06,802
-All junk.
-Put it up there.

51
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:10,325
-Want some ice cream?
-Yeah.

52
00:07:10,489 --> 00:07:13,526
-l need to tink first.
-Okay.

53
00:07:14,369 --> 00:07:19,045
Hey, Abby, bring me the clothes
in the hamper while you're in there.

54
00:07:34,689 --> 00:07:36,645
Karen, are you in? It's Joan.

55
00:07:40,089 --> 00:07:44,958
Okay, I guess you're not there.
Listen, I got a free night tonight.

56
00:07:45,129 --> 00:07:48,678
Billy's on a sleepover.
Call me, now.

57
00:08:10,689 --> 00:08:13,681
Abby, l'm ready for the clothes.

58
00:08:20,289 --> 00:08:22,405
l got her.

59
00:08:23,889 --> 00:08:25,083
What are you doing?

60
00:08:25,249 --> 00:08:28,207
They're less nervous
with something from home.

61
00:08:28,369 --> 00:08:32,806
-First call 30 from now.
-Same as always. Go. Go. Go.

62
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:41,727
You okay? You need help?

63
00:08:48,449 --> 00:08:52,601
-Probed, not insulted.
-We could remove the crayon for you.

64
00:08:52,769 --> 00:08:56,842
It could increase your brainpower,
or it could kill you.

65
00:08:57,329 --> 00:08:59,604
Increase my killing power, eh?

66
00:08:59,769 --> 00:09:03,921
Abby, what happened to you
helping me with the laundry?

67
00:09:04,689 --> 00:09:07,681
-Homey, where have you been?
-I just underwent--

68
00:09:07,849 --> 00:09:10,682
-Why so loud?
-To increase my IQ 50 points.

69
00:09:10,849 --> 00:09:13,363
-Really?
-Abby!

70
00:09:13,529 --> 00:09:15,281
--spiffy nerd ensemble.

71
00:09:17,329 --> 00:09:22,357
Mrs. Jennings, stay calm. Abby's not here,
but she's absolutely fine.

72
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:26,238
My name is Joe. l'm gonna help you
through this thing.

73
00:09:40,449 --> 00:09:42,519
Abby, where are you?!

74
00:10:21,969 --> 00:10:23,368
Good evening.

75
00:10:23,569 --> 00:10:25,878
-Dr. Jennings.
-Yes, doctor.

76
00:10:26,049 --> 00:10:30,247
Several guests mentioned they're
looking forward to your speech.

77
00:10:30,409 --> 00:10:31,478
Nice to hear.

78
00:10:37,809 --> 00:10:39,447
Where's my baby?

79
00:10:39,609 --> 00:10:42,407
-You don't wanna shoot me.
-Where is she?

80
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:46,887
Abby is with my cousin.
My cousin has a cell phone.

81
00:10:47,049 --> 00:10:50,200
lf l don't call every 30 minutes,
he'll kill her.

82
00:10:50,369 --> 00:10:55,079
-Can l just say you look prettier in person?
-Sit down!

83
00:10:55,289 --> 00:10:56,802
Look, Mrs. Jennings.

84
00:10:57,129 --> 00:11:02,647
Nothing is gonna happen to Abby
as long as nothing happens to me. Okay?

85
00:11:02,969 --> 00:11:07,406
You can count on Marvin.
He always does exactly what he's told...

86
00:11:07,569 --> 00:11:10,641
...as long as it's me doing the telling.

87
00:11:10,809 --> 00:11:13,243
What do you want?

88
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:20,203
You're a smart lady. You pick up
things really quickly. You do.

89
00:11:20,369 --> 00:11:22,883
This is a kidnapping for ransom.

90
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:26,962
But it's not just any kidnapping.
lt's a perfect kidnapping.

91
00:11:27,129 --> 00:11:32,522
l know that. l've done it four times
before, and l haven't been caught yet.

92
00:11:32,689 --> 00:11:36,807
-Take me to her, son of a bitch.
-l know what you're thinking.

93
00:11:36,969 --> 00:11:41,599
What happened to the other kids, right?
Every single one of those kids...

94
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:46,889
...is now watching Barney, swimming
in their pools, riding their ponies...

95
00:11:47,049 --> 00:11:51,804
...or whatever rich kids do.
Because l gave their parents the power...

96
00:11:51,969 --> 00:11:53,880
...to keep them alive.

97
00:11:54,369 --> 00:11:58,328
And they did. They followed the rules.

98
00:11:58,489 --> 00:12:02,448
They let me make my calls to Marvin
to keep him safe.

99
00:12:04,729 --> 00:12:06,924
-Now, Karen....
-My God.

100
00:12:07,129 --> 00:12:10,519
l hope it's okay that l call you Karen.

101
00:12:15,209 --> 00:12:18,599
You can keep that gun if you want...

102
00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:25,088
...if it makes you feel better. But l
wanna tell you something about that gun.

103
00:12:25,249 --> 00:12:28,685
lt kills two people with one bullet.

104
00:12:29,289 --> 00:12:31,280
Me...

105
00:12:31,889 --> 00:12:34,278
...and Abby.

106
00:12:44,049 --> 00:12:45,607
May l?

107
00:13:03,729 --> 00:13:06,289
Okay. Thanks.

108
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:13,198
This is quite a place you got here.

109
00:13:18,529 --> 00:13:19,848
Thank you.

110
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:24,082
We are privileged to have with us
a young physician l first met...

111
00:13:24,289 --> 00:13:30,000
...when he was a student doing research
on the sedative properties of Guinness...

112
00:13:30,969 --> 00:13:33,119
...if l remember correctly.

113
00:13:33,289 --> 00:13:38,966
Since then, l've watched him rise from
intern to resident to research scientist...

114
00:13:39,129 --> 00:13:45,079
...and finally, and best of all
l think you'd agree, patent holder.

115
00:13:45,249 --> 00:13:50,562
Ladies and gentlemen, our wunderkind,
Dr. William Jennings.

116
00:13:57,009 --> 00:14:00,285
Why won't you let me
give you the money now?

117
00:14:00,449 --> 00:14:03,009
For one thing, the banks are closed.

118
00:14:03,169 --> 00:14:06,764
For another thing,
it would look a little suspicious.

119
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:11,798
You see, unlike me,
most kidnappers are morons.

120
00:14:11,969 --> 00:14:16,247
They all get busted the minute
they go for the ransom money.

121
00:14:16,409 --> 00:14:19,765
They try all kinds of complicated shit...

122
00:14:19,929 --> 00:14:24,844
...but the fact is that no ransom pickup
is safe from the FBl.

123
00:14:25,009 --> 00:14:31,198
You should see the statistics. Near zero
kidnappings are successful. Know why?

124
00:14:31,369 --> 00:14:37,001
lt's because of the ransom pickup.
That's why l ain't picking up any ransom.

125
00:14:39,049 --> 00:14:41,244
Was that beautiful, or what?

126
00:14:41,449 --> 00:14:46,807
-Why can't Abby be here right now?
-Because this is a machine, okay?

127
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:51,201
This is a machine that runs on fear.

128
00:14:51,369 --> 00:14:54,441
Your fear for Abby.

129
00:14:55,649 --> 00:15:02,043
That's the only thing that kept you
from pulling that trigger. Am l right?

130
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:07,318
Physicians have been unable
to use paralysing relaxants...

131
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:13,280
...without fear of fatal outcomes
or costly lawsuits. That day is over.

132
00:15:13,809 --> 00:15:16,004
l am now injecting Restorase...

133
00:15:16,209 --> 00:15:18,803
...developed by myself
and Brown Adams...

134
00:15:18,969 --> 00:15:24,327
...and tested in my own clinical trials
at Astoria Memorial Hospital in Portland.

135
00:15:27,649 --> 00:15:33,087
This variant of atropine counteracts
the effects of succinylcholine...

136
00:15:33,249 --> 00:15:36,685
...restoring full nerve conductivity
and muscle function.

137
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:41,084
Don't you have any feeling
for the children you hurt?

138
00:15:41,249 --> 00:15:44,241
A kid can stand anything for 24 hours.

139
00:15:44,409 --> 00:15:47,446
l stood a lot worse for years.

140
00:15:49,769 --> 00:15:52,806
What are you talking about, 24 hours?

141
00:15:52,969 --> 00:15:55,642
This whole show takes exactly 24 hours.

142
00:15:55,809 --> 00:15:59,119
A day's work for a day's pay,
250K.

143
00:15:59,289 --> 00:16:02,838
Oh, my God. Listen to me.

144
00:16:03,009 --> 00:16:06,843
lf you wait till tomorrow,
Abby could die.

145
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:08,761
You listen to me, okay?

146
00:16:08,929 --> 00:16:12,080
We're on a timetable.
Get something straight:

147
00:16:12,249 --> 00:16:17,164
There are no deviations,
no exceptions and no surprises.

148
00:16:17,329 --> 00:16:23,359
She's asthmatic, severely asthmatic.
She could have an attack at any time.

149
00:16:23,529 --> 00:16:24,803
Nice try.

150
00:16:27,009 --> 00:16:29,887
Open the drawer you're sitting on.

151
00:16:31,409 --> 00:16:33,081
Open it!

152
00:16:46,809 --> 00:16:49,403
-Shit.
-Anything could bring an attack on.

153
00:16:49,569 --> 00:16:51,287
Allergens, smoke, stress.

154
00:16:51,449 --> 00:16:55,362
-Tell me your cousin doesn't smoke.
-l tried to cover everything.

155
00:16:55,529 --> 00:16:57,997
-Every goddamn thing.
-Does he smoke?

156
00:16:58,169 --> 00:17:00,125
Shut up.

157
00:17:04,129 --> 00:17:05,244
Where are you?

158
00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:09,408
Hey. We're almost there. You're early.
What's the matter?

159
00:17:09,609 --> 00:17:11,759
Listen. Take a look at the kid.

160
00:17:11,969 --> 00:17:14,529
Give me the phone. Give me the phone!

161
00:17:15,769 --> 00:17:20,320
-We got a situation here, Marvin.
-Do you want me to take care of her?

162
00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:26,923
-Not yet.
-lt's been over 30 seconds.

163
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:30,001
-Better hang up.
-This is what l want you to do.

164
00:17:30,169 --> 00:17:34,162
Look at the kid, put your hand
on her chest. ls she breathing?

165
00:17:37,009 --> 00:17:38,601
Hold on.

166
00:17:42,089 --> 00:17:46,082
-It's kind of, lik e, shallow.
-This is what l want you to do.

167
00:17:46,249 --> 00:17:52,358
Get her inside and close the windows.
Don't let her run around. Okay?

168
00:17:53,129 --> 00:17:58,886
lf she has trouble breathing, give her strong
coffee. The caffeine will open her airways.

169
00:18:01,609 --> 00:18:04,919
-Joe? Do you want me to do that?
-Yeah.

170
00:18:05,089 --> 00:18:08,126
Just call me if there's a problem,
okay?

171
00:18:55,249 --> 00:18:59,003
You would be grateful...

172
00:18:59,169 --> 00:19:02,161
...if l helped your little girl, right?

173
00:19:05,169 --> 00:19:07,842
-Yes.
-What?

174
00:19:08,929 --> 00:19:10,567
Yes.

175
00:19:12,729 --> 00:19:15,368
How would you show me?

176
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:28,440
You take me to her first...

177
00:19:29,929 --> 00:19:32,568
...and then l'll show you.

178
00:19:32,729 --> 00:19:36,927
How does every woman know that?
How to be a hooker?

179
00:19:37,089 --> 00:19:39,887
''Get the payment up front.''

180
00:19:40,049 --> 00:19:43,564
ls that what they teach in Home Ec
when we're in Shop?

181
00:19:43,729 --> 00:19:49,122
Nobody has to teach you how to protect
a child. You'd know that if you had one.

182
00:19:51,369 --> 00:19:52,927
Hey, Marvin. lt's me.

183
00:19:53,129 --> 00:19:58,567
-We're almost there. She's still asleep.
-Yeah, okay. Well, l'll call you.

184
00:20:00,889 --> 00:20:03,528
They're not there yet.

185
00:20:04,729 --> 00:20:07,687
l'd like to see the bedroom.

186
00:20:08,529 --> 00:20:10,087
Come on.

187
00:20:11,049 --> 00:20:12,767
Come on.

188
00:20:31,969 --> 00:20:36,281
-Hey, Dr. Jennings. Hi.
-Can l help you?

189
00:20:36,489 --> 00:20:42,041
My keycard doesn't work. l wondered if
l could use your phone to call the desk.

190
00:20:42,209 --> 00:20:45,997
-There's house phones by the elevator.
-Yeah, right.

191
00:20:48,969 --> 00:20:52,564
-That must be such a rush, huh?
-What?

192
00:20:52,729 --> 00:20:57,405
Just standing up there
and having everybody want to be you:

193
00:20:57,569 --> 00:21:02,199
A young guy with a big idea
and a big future.

194
00:21:02,369 --> 00:21:04,803
l got hot just watching you.

195
00:21:04,969 --> 00:21:07,278
l'm flattered.

196
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:13,205
l'm also married.

197
00:21:13,369 --> 00:21:16,998
Then we can do things that don't count.

198
00:21:17,769 --> 00:21:22,479
Because it's something
l'm doing, not you.

199
00:21:22,649 --> 00:21:27,086
l'm sorry, darling,
but l don't think it's gonna happen.

200
00:21:27,249 --> 00:21:32,277
You'll find someone.
Hey, you'll find 50. Just....

201
00:21:32,449 --> 00:21:34,519
Just not me.

202
00:21:37,049 --> 00:21:38,767
Good night.

203
00:21:40,489 --> 00:21:44,368
Fifty's no good to me
because Abby doesn't have 50 daddies.

204
00:21:44,769 --> 00:21:48,205
-What did you say?
-Your daughter was kidnapped.

205
00:21:48,369 --> 00:21:52,601
lf you want her to live,
you'll let me in that room right now.

206
00:21:53,529 --> 00:21:55,520
l'm calling the police.

207
00:21:58,289 --> 00:22:01,042
Don't! lf you call the cops,
the house...

208
00:22:01,249 --> 00:22:04,639
...you may as well put a bullet
into Abby's brain.

209
00:22:06,369 --> 00:22:11,159
l have to make a call in five minutes.
lf anything stops me, your kid is dead.

210
00:22:11,369 --> 00:22:15,521
-What do l do to get my little girl back?
-You're in a new world.

211
00:22:15,689 --> 00:22:17,839
-My partner has your wife...
-My wife?

212
00:22:18,049 --> 00:22:20,279
-...and your girl's being held.
-Where?

213
00:22:20,489 --> 00:22:25,438
When you calm down, l'll make a call.
Then this phone will ring every 30 minutes.

214
00:22:25,609 --> 00:22:29,045
lf things aren't cool,
you can pick out a casket.

215
00:22:29,209 --> 00:22:32,042
-Where's my little girl?
-l don't know.

216
00:22:32,249 --> 00:22:38,245
She's someplace the police can't possibly
get to in the time between our calls.

217
00:22:38,409 --> 00:22:41,287
-That's not good enough.
-Sit down.

218
00:23:10,969 --> 00:23:13,085
What about getting Abby back?

219
00:23:13,249 --> 00:23:17,481
Tomorrow morning your wife will wire
$250,000 to a local bank.

220
00:23:17,649 --> 00:23:19,446
You'll pick up that money.

221
00:23:19,649 --> 00:23:24,006
After you give it to me,
your wife and child will be let go.

222
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:26,125
How's she gonna explain that?

223
00:23:26,289 --> 00:23:30,441
She's gonna say that you stumbled
onto another painting...

224
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:35,444
...that you simply have to add
to your crappy little art collection.

225
00:23:35,609 --> 00:23:40,729
We've got this whole thing covered,
all right? lt's really fucking easy.

226
00:23:40,889 --> 00:23:44,962
You follow the rules, you get Abby back.
lt's that simple.

227
00:23:45,129 --> 00:23:49,168
You think l believe that
after l've seen your face?

228
00:23:49,329 --> 00:23:53,447
This is the fifth time.
All the other parents saw our faces.

229
00:23:53,609 --> 00:23:56,601
Not one of them went to the police.
Know why?

230
00:23:56,769 --> 00:24:00,682
lf you go to the police,
they'll look for us and we'll know.

231
00:24:00,849 --> 00:24:05,081
And my partner will come back,
and he will kill your child.

232
00:24:27,249 --> 00:24:30,002
-Hi.
-Marvin, is everything all right?

233
00:24:31,249 --> 00:24:32,477
Marvin!

234
00:24:32,649 --> 00:24:36,437
-Fine. She's been sleeping.
-I'll call you in a half.

235
00:24:43,249 --> 00:24:44,602
Mommy?

236
00:24:45,889 --> 00:24:51,282
Your mommy's not here right now. l'm
Marvin. She asked me to keep you a while.

237
00:24:51,449 --> 00:24:54,998
-Where is she?
-No, l mean, just for tonight.

238
00:24:55,209 --> 00:24:57,120
Where is she?

239
00:24:57,289 --> 00:25:01,123
-She had to go to a party, okay?
-l want my mom.

240
00:25:01,329 --> 00:25:04,844
Look, it's okay. Hey, hey, hey. No, it's--

241
00:25:05,049 --> 00:25:08,803
lt's okay.
We're gonna be fine here tonight.

242
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:11,517
lt's gonna go by real fast.

243
00:25:11,729 --> 00:25:14,721
-l want my mom.
-Wait. Can you say '' Marvin''?

244
00:25:14,929 --> 00:25:17,079
-Mommy!
-Stop that!

245
00:25:20,449 --> 00:25:24,078
l don't like it when little girls cry.

246
00:25:32,809 --> 00:25:37,644
lf you're good and you promise
to not run away...

247
00:25:37,809 --> 00:25:40,198
...you can play with her.

248
00:25:56,129 --> 00:25:58,723
-Where are you?
-l got him in the room.

249
00:25:58,889 --> 00:26:01,357
-What took you so long?
-Problems.

250
00:26:01,529 --> 00:26:04,919
-What kind of problems?
-He's difficult.

251
00:26:05,089 --> 00:26:08,559
lt's just, he's not like
the other ones, okay?

252
00:26:08,729 --> 00:26:10,447
He doesn't get it.

253
00:26:10,609 --> 00:26:13,043
Okay. Okay.

254
00:26:13,289 --> 00:26:16,042
-Put him on. I'll straighten it out.
-Okay.

255
00:26:21,409 --> 00:26:24,082
-Phone call for you, Dr. Jennings.
-Hello?

256
00:26:24,289 --> 00:26:27,486
-Dr. Will Jennings?
-This is Dr. Jennings. Who's this?

257
00:26:27,689 --> 00:26:30,408
-You can call me Joe.
-Is my wife there?

258
00:26:30,569 --> 00:26:33,800
Yeah. She's right here.
Right here with me.

259
00:26:33,969 --> 00:26:38,121
You should see her face.
She's just starting to get the picture.

260
00:26:38,289 --> 00:26:40,280
Would you like to talk to her?

261
00:26:40,449 --> 00:26:42,883
Okay, but keep it short and sweet.

262
00:26:43,049 --> 00:26:47,725
This is actually my favourite part,
where the happy couples get to talk.

263
00:26:47,889 --> 00:26:49,402
-Will.
-Are you all right?

264
00:26:49,609 --> 00:26:51,918
-They took Abby.
-I'll work this out.

265
00:26:52,089 --> 00:26:53,920
Are you okay? Where are you?

266
00:26:54,089 --> 00:26:58,287
You got a beautiful bedroom.
The view is unbelievable...

267
00:26:59,049 --> 00:27:01,483
... inside and out.

268
00:27:02,129 --> 00:27:07,601
l'm looking at a picture of Abby right now.
Let me tell you, l don't see you at all.

269
00:27:07,769 --> 00:27:12,206
She's the spitting image of your wife.
Makes you wonder, doesn't it?

270
00:27:12,369 --> 00:27:16,362
We've got a difficult situation.
Let me know what you need.

271
00:27:16,569 --> 00:27:20,084
I'll mak e it happen quickly.
Anything you say.

272
00:27:20,249 --> 00:27:25,482
This is your bedside manner, right, where
you talk to people like they're idiots...

273
00:27:25,649 --> 00:27:28,288
...then you do whatever
the fuck you want.

274
00:27:28,449 --> 00:27:32,362
Let me tell you, l am not
your fucking patient, all right?

275
00:27:33,369 --> 00:27:36,008
l've upset you,
but l need you to listen.

276
00:27:36,169 --> 00:27:39,764
-My daughter has asthma.
-Tell me something I don't know.

277
00:27:39,929 --> 00:27:43,842
Three minutes without air
and Abby's brain starts to die.

278
00:27:44,009 --> 00:27:47,046
Abby needs Karen
or she needs her medicine.

279
00:27:47,209 --> 00:27:51,725
That is what is gonna put control
back in your hands.

280
00:27:52,729 --> 00:27:55,687
Back in my hands?

281
00:27:58,649 --> 00:28:01,561
l'm the doctor tonight.

282
00:28:02,569 --> 00:28:07,563
l'm the one that decides whether or not
your little girl lives or dies.

283
00:28:08,329 --> 00:28:13,483
Please don't mak e me prove it.
Now, put my partner back on.

284
00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:22,607
How come we didn't know about
the asthma? How could you miss that?

285
00:28:22,809 --> 00:28:26,040
-I don't lik e it.
-Like l give a shit what you like.

286
00:28:26,209 --> 00:28:29,007
You just keep an eye on him,
all right?

287
00:28:30,969 --> 00:28:32,482
Goodbye.

288
00:28:38,929 --> 00:28:40,760
Who is that guy?

289
00:28:40,929 --> 00:28:42,601
That's my husband.

290
00:28:49,649 --> 00:28:54,723
l wonder if he knows what he's got.

291
00:29:14,889 --> 00:29:16,686
Get your car keys.

292
00:29:21,329 --> 00:29:23,684
lt's time to go.

293
00:29:23,849 --> 00:29:25,282
Here, hop up.

294
00:29:30,089 --> 00:29:33,399
Keep this wrapped around you
when we go outside.

295
00:29:33,569 --> 00:29:36,003
The heater's busted.

296
00:29:36,569 --> 00:29:39,925
Now, when we get back
from this little ride...

297
00:29:40,089 --> 00:29:44,719
...you're gonna get to watch some TV
because you've been good.

298
00:29:49,049 --> 00:29:51,040
What's the matter?

299
00:29:51,209 --> 00:29:53,643
This is all...dusty.

300
00:29:53,809 --> 00:29:56,198
-What?
-l can't--

301
00:29:56,369 --> 00:29:59,281
-Dusty.
-Dusty? Here. There.

302
00:29:59,449 --> 00:30:02,725
Look, it's gone. lt's gone.

303
00:30:02,889 --> 00:30:06,848
Air. My chest. l can't breathe.

304
00:30:07,009 --> 00:30:10,046
-My puffer.
-Your what?

305
00:30:10,249 --> 00:30:13,525
My medicine. Mommy didn't leave me....

306
00:30:16,969 --> 00:30:21,406
Coffee. They said coffee will help.
Coffee.

307
00:30:21,769 --> 00:30:23,441
Mommy.

308
00:30:28,009 --> 00:30:30,204
Hang on, sweetheart.

309
00:30:32,809 --> 00:30:36,006
Okay. Time to put this on.

310
00:30:36,569 --> 00:30:39,163
Go on. Put it around your eyes.

311
00:30:42,849 --> 00:30:45,682
lt's almost 9:00.

312
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:54,117
Hang on, Katie.

313
00:30:54,329 --> 00:30:58,447
Help me...Marvin.

314
00:31:10,129 --> 00:31:12,199
Here. Come on.

315
00:31:18,089 --> 00:31:21,479
Help me. Mommy.

316
00:31:26,809 --> 00:31:31,121
-Talk to me. l like your voice.
-What do you wanna talk about?

317
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:35,965
Well, why don't you tell me
how you met Dr. Will?

318
00:31:41,409 --> 00:31:45,084
You don't wanna talk about that, huh?
Sore subject?

319
00:31:45,249 --> 00:31:47,968
Well, let's see if l can guess.

320
00:31:48,129 --> 00:31:51,565
You were a nurse,
you put him through med school...

321
00:31:51,729 --> 00:31:54,323
...and then you quit to have the baby.

322
00:31:54,769 --> 00:31:57,203
How did you know that?

323
00:31:58,729 --> 00:32:02,768
Well, l'm just an excellent judge
of character.

324
00:32:08,649 --> 00:32:10,844
Are we here?

325
00:32:12,609 --> 00:32:14,645
Marvin will be here soon.

326
00:32:14,809 --> 00:32:18,722
You will not get emotional.
You will not freak out.

327
00:32:18,889 --> 00:32:22,006
You'll give the kid her medicine,
then we'll go.

328
00:32:22,169 --> 00:32:24,285
-l understand.
-Make sure you do.

329
00:32:24,489 --> 00:32:27,242
l'm gonna have a gun on you
every second.

330
00:32:27,409 --> 00:32:32,563
Abby's gonna go a little crazy when
you leave. You're gonna tough it out.

331
00:32:32,729 --> 00:32:36,563
Just like the first day of school.
You remember that, right?

332
00:32:38,209 --> 00:32:43,841
lf you flip out and if you try to run,
l will shoot you.

333
00:32:44,009 --> 00:32:45,727
l'm not gonna shoot her.

334
00:32:45,889 --> 00:32:48,847
l'm gonna shoot you
with her daddy's gun.

335
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:53,446
And she will have nightmares
for the rest of her life.

336
00:32:53,649 --> 00:32:56,322
-Now, get your stuff.
-Mommy? Mommy!

337
00:32:57,769 --> 00:33:00,442
-Abby?
-Mommy!

338
00:33:03,329 --> 00:33:05,001
Oh, God.

339
00:33:13,969 --> 00:33:15,846
Oh, my God.

340
00:33:16,009 --> 00:33:18,239
Are you okay?

341
00:33:19,649 --> 00:33:21,605
Mama's here.

342
00:33:22,529 --> 00:33:25,168
-Let me see you.
-l had an attack.

343
00:33:25,329 --> 00:33:26,682
You did?

344
00:33:27,369 --> 00:33:29,325
Here you go, baby.

345
00:33:29,649 --> 00:33:33,119
-l didn't have any medicine.
-l have your medicine.

346
00:33:33,289 --> 00:33:35,041
-Where were you?
-Here.

347
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:38,686
One, two, three.

348
00:33:39,289 --> 00:33:42,725
One more time. There you go.

349
00:33:42,889 --> 00:33:48,043
You're gonna be fine, okay?
There you go, honey. Okay.

350
00:33:50,649 --> 00:33:53,163
Let me see you. Okay.

351
00:33:53,329 --> 00:33:56,480
-You doing okay?
-She nearly died, Joey.

352
00:33:56,649 --> 00:34:00,358
-She scared me.
-She's got her medicine. She's fine.

353
00:34:00,529 --> 00:34:05,205
-She's just like Katie.
-No, she's not. She's not.

354
00:34:05,369 --> 00:34:07,087
She's another little girl.

355
00:34:07,249 --> 00:34:12,846
She's some doctor's kid you give a pill to
and everything is fine. Understand me?

356
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:15,000
lt sounded the same.

357
00:34:15,529 --> 00:34:17,440
lt's not the same, Marvin.

358
00:34:17,649 --> 00:34:19,924
Here's some water right here.

359
00:34:24,209 --> 00:34:26,882
-Did he hurt you?
-No.

360
00:34:27,049 --> 00:34:31,440
-He hasn't hurt you?
-No. l wanna go home.

361
00:34:31,609 --> 00:34:34,999
l know, baby.
l know you wanna go home.

362
00:34:37,009 --> 00:34:41,002
Just a little bit longer, okay?
Then l'm gonna come get you.

363
00:34:41,169 --> 00:34:44,923
-Okay.
-Put some warm clothes on.

364
00:34:45,769 --> 00:34:48,522
-ls he nice, Abby?
-Yeah.

365
00:34:48,689 --> 00:34:51,647
-Where is he keeping you?
-ln a cabin.

366
00:34:51,849 --> 00:34:53,362
-A cabin?
-Yeah.

367
00:34:53,529 --> 00:34:56,885
-ls it far from here?
-Not that far.

368
00:34:57,089 --> 00:35:00,240
-No? Does he have a gun?
-No.

369
00:35:00,409 --> 00:35:02,286
No gun?

370
00:35:02,489 --> 00:35:07,279
Listen to me. You do everything he says.
But only if he's nice to you.

371
00:35:07,449 --> 00:35:12,284
lf you go to the bathroom, go by yourself.
Don't let him go with you.

372
00:35:12,529 --> 00:35:17,000
Listen to me. We had a little wrinkle,
but we're back on track now.

373
00:35:17,169 --> 00:35:20,161
Just like the other four times.
ls that clear?

374
00:35:20,329 --> 00:35:24,208
-No. lt's different. The medicine--
-lt's not different.

375
00:35:24,369 --> 00:35:29,363
We've gone over this 100,000 times.
We're back to the plan.

376
00:35:29,529 --> 00:35:35,718
l'm gonna talk to you every half-hour.
End of story. Are you okay?

377
00:35:35,929 --> 00:35:38,397
Are you leaving me again?

378
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:44,280
-l have to, baby. Just till the morning.
-Okay, time to go. Marvin?

379
00:35:45,969 --> 00:35:50,042
l am begging you. Let me stay
with her till morning. Please.

380
00:35:50,209 --> 00:35:53,963
See how nice l'm talking?
That's good for her to hear.

381
00:35:54,129 --> 00:35:56,802
You don't want that to change, do you?

382
00:35:56,969 --> 00:35:59,961
-Okay.
-Come on.

383
00:36:00,129 --> 00:36:04,805
-Honey, you're gonna be fine.
-No! Mommy! Mommy!

384
00:36:04,969 --> 00:36:08,928
l love you, honey!
Her medicine! Her medicine!

385
00:36:09,129 --> 00:36:10,926
-Mommy!
-l love you, baby!

386
00:36:19,609 --> 00:36:25,002
Oh, God, no! Don't do this!
That is my baby!

387
00:36:34,769 --> 00:36:35,918
Christ.

388
00:36:36,089 --> 00:36:38,649
Fuck! Fuck!

389
00:36:43,169 --> 00:36:44,807
Shit.

390
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:47,927
What, do you want to fuck this up?

391
00:36:48,089 --> 00:36:52,002
Think you live in a world
where no little girls get killed?

392
00:36:52,169 --> 00:36:54,000
Fuck!

393
00:36:57,529 --> 00:36:59,360
Put this on.

394
00:37:13,569 --> 00:37:19,405
You are one ballsy, motherfucking lady.
l'll give you that.

395
00:37:19,569 --> 00:37:22,959
And everybody's entitled
to one mistake.

396
00:37:23,129 --> 00:37:25,768
Well, you just made yours.

397
00:37:36,009 --> 00:37:39,126
-Baby, put the doc on.
-What are you doing?

398
00:37:39,329 --> 00:37:42,958
-Kid got her medicine. Put the doc on.
-Where are you?

399
00:37:43,169 --> 00:37:46,525
We're going back.
Would you put the fucking doc on?

400
00:37:49,609 --> 00:37:51,725
lt's for you.

401
00:37:57,369 --> 00:37:59,439
-Hello?
-Will. How you doing?

402
00:37:59,609 --> 00:38:04,842
l got a little news update for you.
Here's the little lady.

403
00:38:05,009 --> 00:38:07,569
-Will?
-Baby, are you okay?

404
00:38:07,729 --> 00:38:11,768
-What's happening?
-We saw Abby. She had an attack.

405
00:38:11,929 --> 00:38:14,762
-ls she all right?
-She's fine for now.

406
00:38:14,929 --> 00:38:20,481
l left her medicine with her,
but she's miles away from a hospital.

407
00:38:20,649 --> 00:38:25,518
Whoa! Calm down, college boy.
The kid got a little upset, that's all.

408
00:38:25,689 --> 00:38:30,399
Mommy fixed it. There were some tears,
some screams. Everything's fine.

409
00:38:30,569 --> 00:38:33,447
So listen. Have fun, okay?

410
00:38:52,489 --> 00:38:55,367
Do you need a hankie, baby?

411
00:39:01,769 --> 00:39:03,600
You fuck!

412
00:39:04,929 --> 00:39:06,203
How dare you?

413
00:39:11,169 --> 00:39:14,605
-What happened to you?
-l like it rough sometimes.

414
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:18,284
-You don't have that kind of fun?
-That's not from fun.

415
00:39:18,449 --> 00:39:22,806
-That's a beating. And not just one.
-Really? lt is?

416
00:39:23,009 --> 00:39:26,285
Will you drive me
to the battered women's shelter?

417
00:39:27,649 --> 00:39:29,719
Put this on. Put it on.

418
00:39:32,969 --> 00:39:34,846
Okay, Daddy.

419
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:41,528
-l need to ask you a question.
-Fuck you.

420
00:39:41,729 --> 00:39:44,562
Are you really committed
to this kidnapping?

421
00:39:44,729 --> 00:39:47,801
l think Joe gets his kicks
out of this, not you.

422
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:50,722
What makes you think
l would sell him out?

423
00:39:51,249 --> 00:39:56,118
Stop trying to press my buttons
and let this happen like every other time.

424
00:39:56,289 --> 00:40:00,680
This isn't like every other time.
Abby is sick and you missed that.

425
00:40:00,849 --> 00:40:07,243
What will you do if my daughter dies?
That is all l'm thinking about right now.

426
00:40:10,769 --> 00:40:14,921
You want me to tell Joe you got
the gun on me when he calls?

427
00:40:25,129 --> 00:40:27,040
Who's Katie?

428
00:40:27,209 --> 00:40:28,801
Katie?

429
00:40:29,809 --> 00:40:33,245
That's what you called me
when l was sick.

430
00:40:34,369 --> 00:40:38,203
She was a little girl just like you.

431
00:40:39,289 --> 00:40:41,962
She's in heaven now.

432
00:40:46,009 --> 00:40:49,081
l have a cat in heaven.

433
00:40:50,649 --> 00:40:53,368
Were you her daddy?

434
00:40:56,409 --> 00:40:59,207
She was my family...

435
00:41:00,009 --> 00:41:02,603
...and my friend.

436
00:41:05,289 --> 00:41:08,406
She died two years ago.

437
00:41:10,249 --> 00:41:14,527
You know, when you die
you stay the same age.

438
00:41:14,689 --> 00:41:18,807
So she'll be 6 forever.

439
00:41:20,729 --> 00:41:24,119
Hey, maybe she knows your cat.

440
00:41:24,889 --> 00:41:27,926
That would be kind of a coincidence.

441
00:41:34,049 --> 00:41:35,846
-Yeah.
-Hey, baby.

442
00:41:36,009 --> 00:41:39,365
-We're almost back. ls everything cool?
-No, it's not.

443
00:41:39,889 --> 00:41:42,084
-He flipped out.
-What did he do?

444
00:41:42,569 --> 00:41:44,685
He hit me.

445
00:41:49,009 --> 00:41:50,886
Put him on.

446
00:41:55,809 --> 00:41:58,960
l'm sorry. l lost my head.
lt won't happen again.

447
00:41:59,129 --> 00:42:01,165
What did you hit her with?

448
00:42:01,329 --> 00:42:04,446
The phone. Not hard.

449
00:42:05,129 --> 00:42:07,120
You need to listen now.

450
00:42:07,769 --> 00:42:09,248
What are you doing?

451
00:42:10,329 --> 00:42:12,445
Jesus, Karen!

452
00:42:13,129 --> 00:42:16,166
Shit. Now l got blood on my phone.

453
00:42:18,769 --> 00:42:22,398
Are we clear?
Do you understand how this works?

454
00:42:22,609 --> 00:42:27,046
-Please don't hurt my wife.
-Likewise, asshole.

455
00:42:31,969 --> 00:42:34,608
Well, l did my good deed for the day.

456
00:42:34,769 --> 00:42:37,602
l don't know about you,
but l'm famished.

457
00:42:37,809 --> 00:42:41,245
l got an idea.
Why don't you go sit down...

458
00:42:41,409 --> 00:42:44,481
...and l'll make us dinner.
How's that sound?

459
00:42:44,649 --> 00:42:50,565
A little foreplay never hurt anybody.
All right, let's see what we got here.

460
00:42:52,609 --> 00:42:54,998
No messages?

461
00:42:57,289 --> 00:43:00,599
That's the great thing
about an anaesthesiologist.

462
00:43:00,769 --> 00:43:04,159
They don't have to deal
with any pesky patients.

463
00:43:04,369 --> 00:43:07,441
Most doctors come home,
they got a million calls.

464
00:43:07,609 --> 00:43:10,123
Will's got it all worked out,
doesn't he?

465
00:43:10,289 --> 00:43:14,726
He comes home.
He's got plenty of time to kick back...

466
00:43:14,889 --> 00:43:19,758
...for a nice romantic dinner
with his trophy wife.

467
00:43:21,729 --> 00:43:24,163
l'm really sorry that--

468
00:43:24,329 --> 00:43:27,560
l'm sorry that that had to happen.

469
00:43:29,089 --> 00:43:31,284
l got an idea.

470
00:43:32,369 --> 00:43:35,167
You got any makeup in here?

471
00:43:36,449 --> 00:43:39,247
l'm gonna get you fixed up.

472
00:43:49,089 --> 00:43:51,000
There you go.

473
00:43:55,449 --> 00:43:57,565
Pretty as new.

474
00:44:11,409 --> 00:44:13,320
-Karen?
-lt's almost midnight.

475
00:44:13,489 --> 00:44:15,798
-Who the fuck is that?
-My neighbour.

476
00:44:16,169 --> 00:44:18,239
Karen?

477
00:44:19,369 --> 00:44:22,600
All right. Answer the door, and act.
You got it?

478
00:44:22,769 --> 00:44:26,603
-Just don't do anything crazy.
-That's up to you.

479
00:44:30,329 --> 00:44:32,968
-Hi.
-Hi.

480
00:44:35,569 --> 00:44:37,958
Joan, it's late.
You should have called.

481
00:44:38,169 --> 00:44:41,366
l saw your lights.
l'm on my way to pick up Billy.

482
00:44:41,529 --> 00:44:44,487
When a sleepover goes bad,
you know what l mean.

483
00:44:44,649 --> 00:44:49,928
Since l'm out, l thought l'd pick up
that disc for the auction. Hey, Will.

484
00:44:52,769 --> 00:44:54,964
Sorry. l thought you were Will.

485
00:44:55,129 --> 00:44:58,599
-No, Joan, this is--
-l'm Joe. l'm a friend of Will's.

486
00:45:01,449 --> 00:45:04,361
-Nice to meet you, Joe.
-Nice to meet you.

487
00:45:06,729 --> 00:45:08,003
So where's Will?

488
00:45:09,049 --> 00:45:14,840
Another conference. What else?
l'm gonna get you that disc.

489
00:45:15,009 --> 00:45:19,048
l guess you should have told Joe.
Could have saved him a trip.

490
00:45:19,209 --> 00:45:23,088
Karen and l can struggle along
without Will.

491
00:45:28,529 --> 00:45:30,485
So how do you know Will?

492
00:45:32,489 --> 00:45:35,322
We work together at Northside General.

493
00:45:35,489 --> 00:45:38,242
He means Astoria Memorial, downtown.

494
00:45:38,409 --> 00:45:41,924
Will hasn't worked at Northside
for over a year now.

495
00:45:42,129 --> 00:45:45,599
-Yeah, that's where l met him.
-Yeah.

496
00:45:50,209 --> 00:45:51,801
Joan...

497
00:45:52,969 --> 00:45:57,485
...Joe is my friend, not Will's.

498
00:46:04,889 --> 00:46:06,481
So...

499
00:46:07,289 --> 00:46:08,768
...l'd appreciate it...

500
00:46:08,929 --> 00:46:13,241
...if you didn't mention this
to anyone, you know.

501
00:46:16,729 --> 00:46:19,368
Of course not. l wouldn't--

502
00:46:19,529 --> 00:46:22,282
-Of course not.
-Thanks.

503
00:46:23,129 --> 00:46:27,407
-l'm gonna open some wine.
-Oh, jeez.

504
00:46:31,369 --> 00:46:33,678
God, Karen.

505
00:46:33,849 --> 00:46:36,647
Do you know what you're doing?

506
00:46:36,849 --> 00:46:40,808
-Abby's not here, is she?
-She's upstairs. She's sleeping.

507
00:46:40,969 --> 00:46:44,041
-Don't tell anybody about this, okay?
-l won't.

508
00:46:44,209 --> 00:46:47,804
l had no idea you guys had problems.
Are you all right?

509
00:46:47,969 --> 00:46:50,563
-Yeah, l'm fine.
-You look frazzled.

510
00:46:50,769 --> 00:46:53,329
No, l'm fine. We can't talk right now.

511
00:46:53,529 --> 00:46:58,808
We're about to have dinner. l'll talk
to you about it later. Here's the disc.

512
00:46:58,969 --> 00:47:01,199
l'm here for you.

513
00:47:02,889 --> 00:47:04,607
Bye, Will.

514
00:47:05,529 --> 00:47:08,362
-l mean, bye, Joe.
-Bye.

515
00:47:08,569 --> 00:47:11,367
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

516
00:47:11,529 --> 00:47:16,887
-Good night.
-He's kind of scary. l like that.

517
00:47:23,289 --> 00:47:26,838
She's still watching us
through the window.

518
00:47:30,809 --> 00:47:36,805
She buys it now. Don't fight me
or it's gonna look wrong.

519
00:47:36,969 --> 00:47:38,561
Come on...

520
00:47:39,089 --> 00:47:41,364
...give it all you got.

521
00:47:50,049 --> 00:47:52,279
You're good.

522
00:47:52,449 --> 00:47:54,917
But you could be better.

523
00:48:02,209 --> 00:48:06,043
l could have sworn she was out there.

524
00:48:06,209 --> 00:48:07,722
Yeah.

525
00:48:28,569 --> 00:48:30,844
So you have a kid.

526
00:48:31,009 --> 00:48:35,321
-What the fuck are you talking about?
-C-section scar.

527
00:48:35,969 --> 00:48:38,199
No, l had an ovary taken out.

528
00:48:38,369 --> 00:48:42,840
Wrong kind of scar. l'm a doctor.
l know what l'm looking at.

529
00:48:43,649 --> 00:48:46,686
How can you do this when
you have a kid of your own?

530
00:48:46,849 --> 00:48:49,921
l mean, for God's sake,
bring this to an end.

531
00:48:55,849 --> 00:48:57,441
Baby!

532
00:49:02,169 --> 00:49:06,560
That was good, if l do say so myself.

533
00:49:07,529 --> 00:49:12,045
You should eat.
You need your strength.

534
00:49:14,889 --> 00:49:17,039
God, l stink.

535
00:49:19,089 --> 00:49:24,959
Well, let's see what big Will has here
in the laundry room for me to borrow.

536
00:49:41,129 --> 00:49:44,121
So is this his sexy shirt?

537
00:49:44,649 --> 00:49:48,528
ls this his ''Saturday morning,
let's get down to business...

538
00:49:48,689 --> 00:49:51,487
...make me feel
like l'm 21 again'' shirt?

539
00:49:51,649 --> 00:49:54,038
Let me guess.

540
00:49:54,209 --> 00:49:56,439
You guys do it...

541
00:49:56,609 --> 00:50:01,319
...and then you end up wearing it.
Am l right?

542
00:50:04,929 --> 00:50:07,762
How does it look on me?

543
00:50:08,329 --> 00:50:14,245
-How do you pick who you go after?
-Well, they gotta be rich.

544
00:50:14,409 --> 00:50:17,640
They gotta have kids the right age.

545
00:50:18,129 --> 00:50:20,848
And the moms have to be pretty.

546
00:50:21,009 --> 00:50:24,285
And they have to be doctors, right?

547
00:50:24,849 --> 00:50:28,239
So where did you get your names from?

548
00:50:29,209 --> 00:50:33,327
Where did you get your names?
How did you know Northside General?

549
00:50:33,529 --> 00:50:36,805
Did you work there?
ls that how you know Will?

550
00:50:36,969 --> 00:50:39,437
Where are you going?

551
00:50:47,009 --> 00:50:49,000
What are you doing?

552
00:50:50,329 --> 00:50:51,557
Come here.

553
00:51:12,209 --> 00:51:14,564
Take a look.

554
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:23,718
This is why we're not going to have
any trouble playing house tonight.

555
00:51:59,929 --> 00:52:01,567
Come here.

556
00:52:23,489 --> 00:52:29,041
Does your wife know
that this is part of your plan?

557
00:52:35,089 --> 00:52:38,047
l've got no secrets from my wife.

558
00:52:51,569 --> 00:52:53,446
Let me do it.

559
00:52:56,169 --> 00:52:58,239
ln the bathroom.

560
00:53:02,969 --> 00:53:05,483
You shy?

561
00:53:13,489 --> 00:53:17,277
How can a woman
that looks like you be shy?

562
00:53:45,809 --> 00:53:49,245
-You okay?
-Yeah, just a minute.

563
00:53:49,409 --> 00:53:51,001
Okay.

564
00:54:10,209 --> 00:54:14,680
-Aren't you tired yet?
-My pills keep me up.

565
00:54:14,849 --> 00:54:16,999
l'm kind of hungry.

566
00:54:17,209 --> 00:54:20,360
Yeah, me too.

567
00:54:20,529 --> 00:54:24,920
Let's see.
There's soup in the microwave.

568
00:54:25,089 --> 00:54:26,408
Oh, there's popcorn.

569
00:54:26,569 --> 00:54:30,005
-We should have that with the movie.
-Okay.

570
00:54:30,769 --> 00:54:33,203
Bathroom.

571
00:56:41,809 --> 00:56:44,039
You scared me.

572
00:56:49,209 --> 00:56:50,767
Wow.

573
00:56:54,649 --> 00:56:57,527
You are a beautiful woman.

574
00:56:58,329 --> 00:57:00,763
What do you want to do?

575
00:57:04,169 --> 00:57:08,924
Well, why don't you tell me
what you and Will do...

576
00:57:09,129 --> 00:57:11,768
...and we'll do the opposite.

577
00:57:17,329 --> 00:57:19,923
You mind if we don't talk about him?

578
00:57:20,089 --> 00:57:24,526
Hey, you know, no offence,
but from the looks of him...

579
00:57:25,009 --> 00:57:28,718
...l'd be surprised if he knew
what to do with you.

580
00:57:42,729 --> 00:57:44,526
You think you do?

581
00:57:47,729 --> 00:57:49,845
l'll tell you what.

582
00:57:50,609 --> 00:57:53,362
l'm gonna let you
be the judge of that.

583
00:58:28,969 --> 00:58:30,721
Wow.

584
00:58:30,889 --> 00:58:34,040
You're not like the other moms.

585
00:58:47,209 --> 00:58:49,325
Close your eyes.

586
00:58:51,409 --> 00:58:53,559
l like to watch.

587
01:00:20,409 --> 01:00:24,322
Don't move. Not an inch.

588
01:00:24,929 --> 01:00:26,726
What's that?

589
01:00:26,889 --> 01:00:28,368
lt's a scalpel, Joe.

590
01:00:28,729 --> 01:00:33,086
lt will take your equipment off
so easy you'll barely even feel it.

591
01:00:33,249 --> 01:00:35,524
Jesus Christ.

592
01:00:35,889 --> 01:00:38,961
Now, pick up that phone
and call Marvin.

593
01:00:42,129 --> 01:00:43,847
Like you've got the guts.

594
01:00:44,449 --> 01:00:47,839
l will castrate you
with no more thought...

595
01:00:48,449 --> 01:00:50,644
...than slicing a chicken's neck.

596
01:00:52,889 --> 01:00:55,005
-Do it!
-All right. All right.

597
01:00:55,169 --> 01:00:57,842
Take it easy. Take it easy.

598
01:01:07,409 --> 01:01:11,163
-Dial the number.
-What do you want me to say?

599
01:01:12,289 --> 01:01:14,359
Tell Marvin you have the money.

600
01:01:14,569 --> 01:01:18,118
Tell him to put Abby in his truck
and drive her here.

601
01:01:18,289 --> 01:01:20,120
-ls it ringing?
-Hang on.

602
01:01:20,289 --> 01:01:21,802
ls it ringing?

603
01:01:26,809 --> 01:01:30,245
Abby? lt's ready.

604
01:01:33,809 --> 01:01:36,482
Shit. He's not answering.

605
01:01:49,489 --> 01:01:51,241
Abby!

606
01:01:51,409 --> 01:01:53,240
Don't run away from me!

607
01:01:53,409 --> 01:01:54,888
Abby!

608
01:01:56,689 --> 01:01:59,157
Abby, don't run away!

609
01:01:59,729 --> 01:02:03,005
-You dialled the wrong number.
-No, l swear to God.

610
01:02:03,169 --> 01:02:04,807
Why isn't he picking up?

611
01:02:04,969 --> 01:02:09,087
Abby! l told you not to run away!

612
01:02:13,849 --> 01:02:16,727
-Why isn't he answering?
-The fuck do l know?

613
01:02:16,889 --> 01:02:18,800
lt went to voice mail. Listen.

614
01:02:18,969 --> 01:02:21,358
--is not available. Message CO4.

615
01:02:21,729 --> 01:02:24,163
-The cellular customer...
-Oh, my God.

616
01:02:24,329 --> 01:02:27,287
-...is not available.
-Where is my daughter?

617
01:02:28,049 --> 01:02:30,244
Where is my daughter, you--?

618
01:02:34,969 --> 01:02:36,288
You cut me.

619
01:02:37,169 --> 01:02:39,603
You fucking cut me.

620
01:02:40,169 --> 01:02:42,364
Your kid is dead, bitch.

621
01:02:48,849 --> 01:02:52,000
Hey, you missed!

622
01:02:53,649 --> 01:02:56,209
You fucking missed!

623
01:03:10,929 --> 01:03:13,727
-Mommy!
-Abby, where are you?

624
01:03:13,969 --> 01:03:18,247
l don't know. ln the woods.
l ran outside.

625
01:03:19,529 --> 01:03:21,281
Mommy, come get me.

626
01:03:21,449 --> 01:03:23,963
Abby, listen to me.
Listen to your mom.

627
01:03:24,129 --> 01:03:28,486
Run. Run as fast as you can.
Find a road. Stop a car, and call 911.

628
01:03:28,649 --> 01:03:32,278
-Just get out. Don't let him catch you.
-l'm scared.

629
01:03:32,449 --> 01:03:35,486
You'll be fine.
l'm coming to get you. Run.

630
01:03:35,649 --> 01:03:37,128
Open the fucking door!

631
01:03:37,289 --> 01:03:39,564
-Abby!
-Mommy!

632
01:03:42,609 --> 01:03:44,088
Open this fucking door!

633
01:03:48,169 --> 01:03:49,602
Mommy!

634
01:03:49,769 --> 01:03:53,842
-Let go of me!
-Sorry, but she shouldn't have run away.

635
01:03:54,009 --> 01:03:57,718
-Open the fucking door!
-Put my baby back on the phone.

636
01:04:02,769 --> 01:04:06,728
You tell him to not hurt my daughter.

637
01:04:06,889 --> 01:04:08,402
Tell him.

638
01:04:09,969 --> 01:04:11,448
Marvin.

639
01:04:13,009 --> 01:04:16,638
lf you hear a shot, kill the kid.

640
01:04:30,689 --> 01:04:33,761
You just made your second mistake.

641
01:04:43,969 --> 01:04:46,688
l need to use the bathroom.

642
01:04:48,369 --> 01:04:50,599
I hope they shrivel up
and fall off.

643
01:05:06,089 --> 01:05:10,685
I understand everything. I don't need
it explained to me. I live it.

644
01:05:10,889 --> 01:05:13,005
Sometimes I get a little upset.

645
01:05:21,809 --> 01:05:23,481
Read that.

646
01:05:26,609 --> 01:05:29,282
That's a message from my wife.

647
01:05:31,489 --> 01:05:33,764
-Where's Abby?
-l don't know.

648
01:05:33,929 --> 01:05:36,841
You do.
You've done this four times before.

649
01:05:37,249 --> 01:05:39,763
Me not knowing is part of the plan.

650
01:05:39,929 --> 01:05:44,320
This is succinylcholine.
lf l inject this, you'll be paralysed.

651
01:05:44,649 --> 01:05:48,528
You'll see, hear, and think, but you
won't be able to move or breathe.

652
01:05:48,689 --> 01:05:49,917
The fuck are you doing?

653
01:05:50,089 --> 01:05:54,765
l have seen murderers turned into
babies by this. But you have a choice.

654
01:05:54,929 --> 01:06:00,049
Tell me where Joe is holding Abby,
or find out what it feels like to die.

655
01:06:00,209 --> 01:06:04,566
lf l pull this trigger,
you will be dead.

656
01:06:07,489 --> 01:06:08,808
Pull it.

657
01:06:11,969 --> 01:06:14,437
No! No! Fuck!

658
01:06:16,289 --> 01:06:18,723
Don't fight it, Cheryl.

659
01:06:36,129 --> 01:06:39,485
l know you can hear me.
You're trying to struggle.

660
01:06:39,649 --> 01:06:42,368
Telling your arms to move,
but they won't.

661
01:06:42,529 --> 01:06:47,319
You want to breathe, but you can't.
Unless l give you the antidote.

662
01:06:54,049 --> 01:06:56,279
lt's like living death, isn't it?

663
01:06:56,449 --> 01:06:59,600
Maybe you feel almost
as frightened as my girl.

664
01:06:59,769 --> 01:07:04,399
We are going to do this over and over
until you tell me where she is...

665
01:07:04,609 --> 01:07:06,918
...or until l can't bring you back.

666
01:07:12,729 --> 01:07:14,685
Remember what l told Joe.

667
01:07:14,849 --> 01:07:18,888
Three and a half minutes without air,
and the brain is dying.

668
01:07:19,089 --> 01:07:23,048
You're almost there, Cheryl.
Remember what this feels like.

669
01:07:25,409 --> 01:07:26,842
Shit.

670
01:08:00,529 --> 01:08:02,724
Now, where's Abby?

671
01:08:05,889 --> 01:08:07,686
Where is she?

672
01:08:08,609 --> 01:08:11,077
ls that what my baby felt?

673
01:08:11,409 --> 01:08:12,842
What?

674
01:08:13,889 --> 01:08:19,168
ls that what my baby felt
when you killed her?

675
01:08:19,329 --> 01:08:21,604
What are you talking about?

676
01:08:23,049 --> 01:08:25,119
Get my wallet.

677
01:08:35,369 --> 01:08:37,360
Turn it over.

678
01:08:40,089 --> 01:08:41,442
Oh, God.

679
01:08:43,529 --> 01:08:46,999
-Katie Hickey.
-Yeah, Katie Hickey.

680
01:08:48,769 --> 01:08:50,407
You think l killed Katie?

681
01:08:50,769 --> 01:08:55,240
-l know you did. The surgeon told me.
-Told you what?

682
01:08:55,409 --> 01:09:00,085
You didn't resuscitate her right.
You didn't control her bleeding.

683
01:09:00,249 --> 01:09:03,286
You didn't monitor her pressure.

684
01:09:03,449 --> 01:09:08,807
Katie had Wilms' Tumour. The surgeon
had difficulty trying to remove it.

685
01:09:09,009 --> 01:09:11,125
He cut into a major artery.

686
01:09:11,409 --> 01:09:15,038
He said she was fine
and her operation went well.

687
01:09:15,209 --> 01:09:19,043
He lied. He told you Katie died
in recovery to protect himself.

688
01:09:19,209 --> 01:09:22,281
So that you wouldn't think
it was his fault.

689
01:09:22,849 --> 01:09:26,637
Jesus. And this is why you chose us.

690
01:09:27,849 --> 01:09:30,363
Joe wants revenge.

691
01:09:30,529 --> 01:09:32,406
None of the kids get hurt.

692
01:09:33,689 --> 01:09:37,728
Cheryl, you have to tell me
where my daughter is.

693
01:09:46,729 --> 01:09:50,642
There's a cabin east of here,
somewhere in the Cascades.

694
01:09:55,409 --> 01:09:56,967
Okay.

695
01:09:57,409 --> 01:10:00,287
lt's time to make the call.

696
01:10:03,849 --> 01:10:06,363
You think you're smarter...

697
01:10:06,529 --> 01:10:09,487
...than all the other moms...

698
01:10:10,809 --> 01:10:12,800
...but you're not.

699
01:10:14,129 --> 01:10:18,168
Because see, they didn't hurt me.

700
01:10:20,449 --> 01:10:23,759
And their kids are still alive.

701
01:10:27,569 --> 01:10:31,847
l want you to think about Marvin now.

702
01:10:32,329 --> 01:10:34,479
Sitting there...

703
01:10:34,649 --> 01:10:36,321
...watching the clock.

704
01:10:38,489 --> 01:10:40,047
Waiting.

705
01:10:53,369 --> 01:10:55,280
lt's time.

706
01:11:00,049 --> 01:11:03,485
lt's time to play a game.

707
01:11:03,889 --> 01:11:07,802
But first,
you have to close your eyes.

708
01:11:10,249 --> 01:11:11,807
Joe...

709
01:11:14,689 --> 01:11:17,157
...she's my daughter.

710
01:11:21,729 --> 01:11:24,163
She's my little girl.

711
01:11:35,689 --> 01:11:38,761
Okay, now what you have to do...

712
01:11:38,929 --> 01:11:43,081
...is you have to think nice thoughts.

713
01:11:43,249 --> 01:11:45,365
Pretty thoughts.

714
01:11:45,529 --> 01:11:48,999
l'm thinking about my mommy.

715
01:11:49,169 --> 01:11:53,526
Yeah, that's it. She's pretty.

716
01:11:54,929 --> 01:11:58,205
She's pretty
and she loves you very much.

717
01:12:03,689 --> 01:12:08,922
Now, l want you to stay very still.

718
01:12:27,089 --> 01:12:29,842
-Joey?
-Who the fuck else would it be?

719
01:12:30,689 --> 01:12:33,886
You're late, Joey. You can't be late!

720
01:12:34,049 --> 01:12:37,166
l know,
but everything's all right now.

721
01:12:37,329 --> 01:12:40,002
lt's gonna be over soon.

722
01:12:40,969 --> 01:12:43,847
Just like the other times. Right?

723
01:12:44,569 --> 01:12:49,484
-Right?
-Yeah, just like the other times.

724
01:13:03,209 --> 01:13:05,086
l'm gonna follow your plan.

725
01:13:07,649 --> 01:13:10,846
You don't have to worry about me.

726
01:13:13,769 --> 01:13:16,488
And you'll get your money.

727
01:13:20,129 --> 01:13:24,168
Did you ever think that maybe
this wasn't about the money?

728
01:13:24,369 --> 01:13:25,927
l mean...

729
01:13:27,089 --> 01:13:30,161
...did that ever cross your mind?

730
01:13:32,249 --> 01:13:37,960
That a guy like me could be motivated
by something other than greed?

731
01:13:40,409 --> 01:13:42,445
Hank? Wake up. lt's an emergency.

732
01:13:43,489 --> 01:13:44,604
What happened?

733
01:13:44,809 --> 01:13:49,166
My child is in danger, but you
can help. You can't call the police.

734
01:13:49,609 --> 01:13:50,928
l don't understand.

735
01:13:51,129 --> 01:13:55,327
My daughter was kidnapped.
lf l go to the police they'll kill her.

736
01:13:55,529 --> 01:13:57,520
-Do you understand?
-Yes.

737
01:13:57,689 --> 01:13:59,600
They're using cell phones.

738
01:13:59,769 --> 01:14:04,797
l'm praying a vice president
of Wirecell can trace those calls.

739
01:14:19,769 --> 01:14:21,282
Can l go home now?

740
01:14:22,769 --> 01:14:24,521
Pretty soon.

741
01:14:24,889 --> 01:14:27,483
Go home and see your mommy.

742
01:14:27,769 --> 01:14:30,283
We have to wait for a phone call.

743
01:14:30,449 --> 01:14:32,599
Then we can go.

744
01:14:32,889 --> 01:14:35,164
Those are the rules.

745
01:14:37,209 --> 01:14:40,042
lt's funny that they
always do it the same...

746
01:14:40,209 --> 01:14:43,121
...with the clouds and the sun,
and flowers.

747
01:14:46,529 --> 01:14:49,919
She does the hands good, though,
you know.

748
01:14:51,129 --> 01:14:55,008
They have trouble with that,
but she's good.

749
01:15:07,689 --> 01:15:10,681
lt's a bad day, isn't it?

750
01:15:12,369 --> 01:15:14,041
l know.

751
01:15:15,849 --> 01:15:17,999
l know you have kids, Joe.

752
01:15:24,889 --> 01:15:27,278
Don't think that you know me.

753
01:15:32,729 --> 01:15:36,039
Okay, come on.

754
01:15:36,249 --> 01:15:40,288
Put a smile on. lt's showtime.

755
01:15:43,729 --> 01:15:45,799
-We've got something for you.
-Yeah?

756
01:15:46,009 --> 01:15:48,807
-A phone logging on every 30 minutes.
-Where?

757
01:15:49,009 --> 01:15:53,127
lt's near a place called Zillah
in the Eastern Cascades.

758
01:15:53,289 --> 01:15:56,565
We can put a tracing vehicle in
that's 45 minutes away.

759
01:15:56,729 --> 01:15:59,960
-Do it. Do it.
-But to do that...

760
01:16:00,129 --> 01:16:02,643
...l gotta talk to somebody above me.

761
01:16:02,849 --> 01:16:05,409
-No.
-Bringing in the authorities.

762
01:16:05,609 --> 01:16:07,884
-You can't--
-You'll get us killed...

763
01:16:08,049 --> 01:16:10,438
...when Joey finds out
you traced his calls.

764
01:16:10,649 --> 01:16:13,686
Don't tell him.
Tell him the truth about Katie's death.

765
01:16:13,849 --> 01:16:17,285
He won't believe what l say.
He'll say l betrayed him.

766
01:16:17,449 --> 01:16:20,247
l've got to phone him back
or he'll call the police.

767
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:22,684
lt's time to go to the bank.

768
01:16:27,289 --> 01:16:28,881
You drive.

769
01:16:32,249 --> 01:16:34,809
Hey, it's me.

770
01:16:34,969 --> 01:16:36,925
Yeah, l know. We're on our way.

771
01:16:37,289 --> 01:16:39,883
What time's he gonna get there?

772
01:16:40,169 --> 01:16:41,443
We'll be there.

773
01:16:57,809 --> 01:17:02,087
Morning, Gray. l can tell by the look,
you got that call from Will.

774
01:17:02,249 --> 01:17:04,809
$250,000 for a painting in cash.

775
01:17:04,969 --> 01:17:09,360
He needs it wired to the bank in
Seattle by 10, or it goes on auction.

776
01:17:15,729 --> 01:17:19,244
The money should be in Seattle by now.
Call and see.

777
01:17:19,409 --> 01:17:22,003
Fuck! We've got company.

778
01:17:23,329 --> 01:17:27,368
You're being paranoid.
lt could be a traffic chopper.

779
01:17:27,529 --> 01:17:32,398
Fuck it. lt doesn't matter now, anyway.
Pull into that lot.

780
01:17:38,929 --> 01:17:41,489
-There's Cheryl.
-ls Abby with her?

781
01:17:41,649 --> 01:17:44,482
Pull your window up.
All right, slow down.

782
01:17:44,649 --> 01:17:48,005
l don't want her to panic.
Pull in right here.

783
01:17:52,009 --> 01:17:53,442
How you doing today?

784
01:17:53,889 --> 01:17:56,961
Oh, my God! What are you doing?

785
01:17:57,169 --> 01:17:58,284
Stop!

786
01:17:58,449 --> 01:18:01,521
You got two seconds
to get in that fucking car!

787
01:18:03,329 --> 01:18:05,604
Lock the door!

788
01:18:19,849 --> 01:18:23,808
You see that?
You see those fucking assholes?

789
01:18:24,009 --> 01:18:26,159
l am a goddamn genius!

790
01:18:26,329 --> 01:18:29,480
See you, boys! Happy hunting.

791
01:18:34,009 --> 01:18:37,763
You got seven minutes.
Don't make me call him.

792
01:18:40,569 --> 01:18:44,528
-l'm Dr. Will Jennings.
-Mr. Hibbing wants to speak with you.

793
01:18:44,689 --> 01:18:46,281
What for? l'm in a rush.

794
01:18:46,449 --> 01:18:50,203
lt'll only take a minute.
Just a formality. Follow me.

795
01:18:50,369 --> 01:18:53,998
Hello, Dr. Jennings.
As you can see, we have your money.

796
01:18:54,169 --> 01:18:57,400
-Sit, please.
-l'm in a rush. What's the holdup?

797
01:18:57,929 --> 01:19:01,717
Dr. Jennings, l'm special agent
Bill Chalmers of the FBl.

798
01:19:01,889 --> 01:19:04,642
We got a tip your daughter
had been kidnapped.

799
01:19:04,849 --> 01:19:08,000
-We'll help you get your daughter back.
-How?

800
01:19:08,209 --> 01:19:11,440
The best chance of rescue
is at the ransom exchange.

801
01:19:11,849 --> 01:19:14,921
Our SWAT teams are trained
for this scenario.

802
01:19:15,129 --> 01:19:20,157
But for them to do their job, they have
to hear what's going on at the drop.

803
01:19:20,329 --> 01:19:22,524
We need you to wear a wire.

804
01:19:22,729 --> 01:19:26,642
lf this guy knows you're involved,
he'll kill my daughter.

805
01:19:26,849 --> 01:19:32,242
We know what we're doing. Time is
running out. Will you wear the wire?

806
01:19:36,049 --> 01:19:37,038
All right.

807
01:19:44,729 --> 01:19:47,197
What took you so long?

808
01:19:52,089 --> 01:19:57,322
Out of sequence, no new bills.
Excellent. Stick it in this bag. Quick.

809
01:20:08,129 --> 01:20:10,927
-You get the money yet?
-Yeah, l got it.

810
01:20:12,089 --> 01:20:14,205
Anything you want to tell me?

811
01:20:14,369 --> 01:20:17,918
No. What the fuck
are you talking about?

812
01:20:19,129 --> 01:20:21,643
-Nothing.
-We're going back to the hotel.

813
01:20:21,809 --> 01:20:24,687
-Where's the meeting?
-Don't worry about that now.

814
01:20:24,849 --> 01:20:28,319
Fly out of Seattle, commercial.
Use your cold passport.

815
01:20:28,489 --> 01:20:31,561
Marvin and l will meet you
at the destination.

816
01:20:31,729 --> 01:20:34,163
Why? We're supposed
to travel together.

817
01:20:34,329 --> 01:20:39,198
There's been complications. This
is better for everyone. lt's safer.

818
01:20:39,369 --> 01:20:43,203
No, don't change the fucking plan!
Don't break your own rules.

819
01:20:43,409 --> 01:20:45,684
That's how you get in trouble.

820
01:20:45,849 --> 01:20:51,287
-Don't break your own fucking rules!
-l make the fucking rules, all right?

821
01:20:51,449 --> 01:20:55,761
And l can fucking break them!
Shut up and do what you're told!

822
01:20:56,609 --> 01:20:58,042
For fuck's sak e.

823
01:20:59,449 --> 01:21:01,679
Joey, what are you doing?

824
01:21:02,049 --> 01:21:04,404
You're not gonna hurt anybody, right?

825
01:21:04,569 --> 01:21:07,447
We don't need to do that.
We don't hurt people.

826
01:21:07,649 --> 01:21:10,038
l got the money. We are home free.

827
01:21:10,249 --> 01:21:13,798
-We did what we needed to do.
-Right. Absolutely.

828
01:21:13,969 --> 01:21:16,563
Hurt anybody?
What are you talking about?

829
01:21:16,729 --> 01:21:19,687
What makes you think l'll hurt anybody?

830
01:21:19,849 --> 01:21:22,317
This is just a cleaner exit. That's all.

831
01:21:22,769 --> 01:21:27,684
lt's just a cleaner exit.
l got a surprise for you, baby.

832
01:21:28,209 --> 01:21:30,245
lt's like a--

833
01:21:30,729 --> 01:21:33,960
lt's like a once
in a lifetime thing, man.

834
01:21:34,129 --> 01:21:37,724
It's gonna be great down there.
Fucking great.

835
01:21:38,969 --> 01:21:43,804
-Look, l gotta get off now, all right.
-No, Joey, don't go! Don't go!

836
01:21:44,009 --> 01:21:45,567
l'll see you later.

837
01:21:51,049 --> 01:21:53,563
What's going on?

838
01:21:55,529 --> 01:21:59,727
You can't pretend anymore. You know
what he'll do if you don't stop him.

839
01:22:00,209 --> 01:22:06,284
l can't stall. l gotta bring you back
to the hotel. He's gonna call randomly.

840
01:22:06,449 --> 01:22:10,328
Look, you have to convince Joe
that l didn't kill Katie.

841
01:22:10,489 --> 01:22:14,801
l'll help you get out of this.
With your money, conscience and Joey.

842
01:22:15,009 --> 01:22:20,129
But you have to tell him the truth
about Katie. You have to stop him.

843
01:22:30,089 --> 01:22:32,762
-It's Cheryl.
-You're breaking the rules.

844
01:22:32,969 --> 01:22:36,245
No, listen to me.
lt's Joey who's breaking the rules.

845
01:22:36,409 --> 01:22:41,244
Joey will hurt that little girl.
He might kill her. We have to help him.

846
01:22:42,489 --> 01:22:46,198
-You're not supposed to call me.
-Marvin. Marvin!

847
01:22:57,249 --> 01:22:59,126
He killed the wire.

848
01:22:59,289 --> 01:23:02,998
All units maintain visual
on the target, but don't approach.

849
01:23:03,889 --> 01:23:06,847
Look, l have an idea.

850
01:23:09,089 --> 01:23:11,762
Drive me to the waterfront.

851
01:23:14,849 --> 01:23:18,444
Get the front desk manager, Mr. Holden.
lt's an emergency.

852
01:23:18,809 --> 01:23:20,401
Hurry.

853
01:23:21,449 --> 01:23:25,044
-This is Mr. Holden, may I help you?
-This is Dr. Jennings.

854
01:23:25,209 --> 01:23:29,760
-We spoke yesterday.
-Yes. We're set up for the conference.

855
01:23:29,929 --> 01:23:31,999
lt's not that. l'm not there now...

856
01:23:32,209 --> 01:23:36,168
...but l need someone to think l am.
Can you forward my calls?

857
01:23:36,889 --> 01:23:39,039
-Yes, l can arrange that.
-Great.

858
01:24:16,329 --> 01:24:19,207
Puget Grand Hotel.
Dr. William Jennings' room?

859
01:24:20,129 --> 01:24:22,927
-Thank you.
-One moment, please.

860
01:24:26,929 --> 01:24:29,079
-Where are we going?
-To Zillah.

861
01:24:29,249 --> 01:24:32,446
lt's the only thing l know to do
at this point.

862
01:24:33,609 --> 01:24:38,683
-lt's Joey. ls it for you or me?
-First call. lt's for me, that's my guess.

863
01:24:38,849 --> 01:24:42,239
Can't let him hear the plane.
l gotta cut the engine.

864
01:24:46,489 --> 01:24:48,445
-Hello?
-Hey, there, college boy.

865
01:24:48,649 --> 01:24:51,163
Just checking
to make sure you're there.

866
01:24:56,329 --> 01:24:57,887
Stay put, now.

867
01:24:58,089 --> 01:24:59,238
Okay.

868
01:25:13,609 --> 01:25:18,478
lt's okay. We've got enough altitude
as long as the calls are quick.

869
01:25:26,489 --> 01:25:30,687
Abby and Marvin should be just
a couple of miles up ahead now.

870
01:25:38,049 --> 01:25:39,880
Hey, Abby.

871
01:25:41,289 --> 01:25:43,803
l made you something.

872
01:25:56,409 --> 01:25:58,764
This will be for you.

873
01:25:59,609 --> 01:26:01,520
-Ready?
-Yes.

874
01:26:09,929 --> 01:26:13,524
Wait. l called the doc's room.
How did l get you?

875
01:26:13,729 --> 01:26:16,687
l'm just leaving
the hotel right now, baby.

876
01:26:16,889 --> 01:26:20,279
-You fucking with me?
-No, are you fucking with me?

877
01:26:20,449 --> 01:26:25,000
-Where are we gonna meet?
-Okay, okay. lt's okay.

878
01:26:25,209 --> 01:26:27,325
Okay, listen to me, baby.

879
01:26:27,489 --> 01:26:31,562
You trust me? Are you still my baby?

880
01:26:31,969 --> 01:26:35,848
-Are you still my little girl?
-Yes, l'm still your baby.

881
01:26:36,249 --> 01:26:41,926
l love you.
l love you so much.

882
01:26:42,649 --> 01:26:44,241
Put the doc on.

883
01:26:45,449 --> 01:26:47,280
-Hello?
-Hey, Will.

884
01:26:48,049 --> 01:26:51,564
You're never gonna see your kid again.

885
01:26:54,609 --> 01:26:56,964
Pull it up! Pull it up!

886
01:26:57,409 --> 01:26:58,808
Jesus!

887
01:27:27,049 --> 01:27:30,086
Jesus. Thank God.

888
01:27:36,129 --> 01:27:39,087
This is Dr. Jennings.
FBl agents, please respond.

889
01:27:39,249 --> 01:27:42,685
-You can't talk to the FBl.
-Special Agent Summers.

890
01:27:42,849 --> 01:27:46,967
My daughter's in a moving truck on l-5.
They're gonna kill her.

891
01:27:47,129 --> 01:27:51,088
-You have to set down on the highway.
-Negative. We're in a chopper.

892
01:27:51,249 --> 01:27:56,039
-Ground unit's only 20 minutes away.
-That's too long! Set down now!

893
01:27:58,489 --> 01:28:00,719
Tighten your seatbelt.

894
01:28:16,129 --> 01:28:19,041
There's the road.
They're down there somewhere.

895
01:28:19,329 --> 01:28:22,844
Keep your eyes peeled
for Marvin's pickup truck.

896
01:28:57,169 --> 01:28:59,603
What the fuck is this guy doing?

897
01:29:00,089 --> 01:29:03,968
Wait a minute. That's Will, isn't it?

898
01:29:05,409 --> 01:29:08,367
That's the fucking doc, isn't it?
Answer me!

899
01:29:14,529 --> 01:29:18,044
-There's Marvin. lt must be Marvin.
-Are you sure?

900
01:29:18,249 --> 01:29:20,240
Brown truck.

901
01:29:29,849 --> 01:29:31,441
Fuck!

902
01:29:37,729 --> 01:29:39,560
What are you doing?

903
01:29:43,169 --> 01:29:46,957
-What's wrong? lt's not time yet.
-You see this fucking guy?

904
01:29:47,169 --> 01:29:49,444
-You see a plane?
-No!

905
01:29:55,849 --> 01:29:57,567
Fucking bitch!

906
01:30:00,769 --> 01:30:02,805
Watch out!

907
01:30:46,769 --> 01:30:48,885
What are you gonna do?

908
01:31:29,729 --> 01:31:31,447
Cheryl, jump!

909
01:31:31,649 --> 01:31:32,764
Jump!

910
01:31:46,529 --> 01:31:48,121
Abby.

911
01:31:50,609 --> 01:31:55,205
Abby, get out. Get out! Run fast!

912
01:32:08,809 --> 01:32:09,844
Daddy!

913
01:32:11,049 --> 01:32:12,880
Daddy!

914
01:32:13,089 --> 01:32:14,807
Daddy!

915
01:32:16,209 --> 01:32:18,120
No!

916
01:32:27,729 --> 01:32:30,004
Where's my little girl?!

917
01:32:31,569 --> 01:32:33,605
-Where's Abby?!
-l don't know.

918
01:32:33,809 --> 01:32:36,562
-What do you mean?
-Because l don't know!

919
01:32:43,129 --> 01:32:45,279
FBl! l need you to drop that gun.

920
01:32:48,209 --> 01:32:49,961
Joey.

921
01:32:50,169 --> 01:32:51,682
Joey!

922
01:32:54,449 --> 01:32:56,519
Guess what, doc?

923
01:32:57,929 --> 01:33:00,363
You don't get to die today...

924
01:33:00,529 --> 01:33:04,681
...because l want you to spend
the rest of your fucking life...

925
01:33:04,849 --> 01:33:06,885
...feeling like l feel!

926
01:33:07,049 --> 01:33:10,439
You're wrong about how Katie died.
