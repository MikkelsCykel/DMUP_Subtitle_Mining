<i>The world is changed.</i>

2
00:00:47,603 --> 00:00:50,295
<i>I feel it in the water.</i>

3
00:00:51,407 --> 00:00:53,974
<i>I feel it in the earth.</i>

4
00:00:55,878 --> 00:00:58,570
<i>I smell it in the air.</i>

5
00:00:59,282 --> 00:01:00,847
<i>Much that once was...</i>

6
00:01:01,384 --> 00:01:02,608
<i>... is lost.</i>

7
00:01:03,653 --> 00:01:06,345
<i>For none now live who remember it.</i>

8
00:01:19,602 --> 00:01:23,636
<i>It began with the forging
of the Great Rings.</i>

9
00:01:24,173 --> 00:01:25,738
<i>Three were given to the Elves:</i>

10
00:01:26,242 --> 00:01:29,708
<i>Immortal, wisest and fairest
of all beings.</i>

11
00:01:31,113 --> 00:01:32,838
<i>Seven to the Dwarf-lords:</i>

12
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:38,019
<i>Great miners and craftsmen
of the mountain halls.</i>

13
00:01:38,821 --> 00:01:39,715
<i>And nine...</i>

14
00:01:40,256 --> 00:01:42,948
<i>... nine rings were gifted
to the race of Men...</i>

15
00:01:43,492 --> 00:01:46,992
<i>... who, above all else, desire power.</i>

16
00:01:48,464 --> 00:01:53,329
<i>For within these rings was bound
the strength and will to govern each race.</i>

17
00:01:55,171 --> 00:01:57,999
<i>But they were all of them deceived.</i>

18
00:01:58,574 --> 00:02:00,333
<i>For another ring was made.</i>

19
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:04,737
<i>In the land of Mordor,
in the fires of Mount Doom...</i>

20
00:02:05,514 --> 00:02:09,651
<i>... the Dark Lord Sauron forged
in secret a Master Ring...</i>

21
00:02:10,186 --> 00:02:11,877
<i>... to control all others.</i>

22
00:02:12,421 --> 00:02:16,057
<i>And into this Ring he poured
his cruelty, his malice...</i>

23
00:02:16,592 --> 00:02:20,456
<i>... and his will to dominate all life.</i>

24
00:02:21,764 --> 00:02:25,332
<i>One Ring to rule them all.</i>

25
00:02:26,502 --> 00:02:27,829
<i>One by one...</i>

26
00:02:28,371 --> 00:02:32,701
<i>... the Free Lands of Middle-earth
fell to the power of the Ring.</i>

27
00:02:33,242 --> 00:02:35,934
<i>But there were some who resisted.</i>

28
00:02:36,746 --> 00:02:41,076
<i>A Last Alliance of Men and Elves
marched against the armies of Mordor.</i>

29
00:02:41,617 --> 00:02:45,913
<i>And on the slopes of Mount Doom, they
fought for the freedom of Middle-earth.</i>

30
00:03:16,585 --> 00:03:18,845
<i>Victory was near.</i>

31
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,389
<i>But the power of the Ring...</i>

32
00:03:26,562 --> 00:03:27,627
<i>... could not be undone.</i>

33
00:03:52,588 --> 00:03:54,153
<i>It was in this moment...</i>

34
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,756
<i>... when all hope had faded...</i>

35
00:03:57,293 --> 00:04:01,054
<i>... that Isildur, son of the king,
took up his father's sword.</i>

36
00:04:32,495 --> 00:04:38,657
<i>Sauron, the enemy of the Free Peoples
of Middle-earth, was defeated.</i>

37
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:47,702
<i>The Ring passed to Isildur...</i>

38
00:04:48,244 --> 00:04:52,142
<i>... who had this one chance
to destroy evil forever.</i>

39
00:04:53,182 --> 00:04:54,975
<i>But the hearts of Men...</i>

40
00:04:55,518 --> 00:04:57,686
<i>... are easily corrupted.</i>

41
00:04:58,254 --> 00:05:02,550
<i>And the Ring of Power
has a will of its own.</i>

42
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:15,061
<i>It betrayed Isildur to his death.</i>

43
00:05:17,573 --> 00:05:21,107
<i>And some things
that should not have been forgotten...</i>

44
00:05:21,644 --> 00:05:23,642
<i>... were lost.</i>

45
00:05:24,847 --> 00:05:26,708
<i>History became legend...</i>

46
00:05:27,249 --> 00:05:28,917
<i>... legend became myth.</i>

47
00:05:29,452 --> 00:05:31,985
<i>And for
two and a half thousand years...</i>

48
00:05:32,521 --> 00:05:35,884
<i>... the Ring passed
out of all knowledge.</i>

49
00:05:36,859 --> 00:05:39,323
<i>Until, when chance came...</i>

50
00:05:40,329 --> 00:05:43,123
<i>... it ensnared a new bearer.</i>

51
00:05:44,834 --> 00:05:49,369
My precious.

52
00:05:49,939 --> 00:05:52,130
<i>The Ring came to the creature
Gollum...</i>

53
00:05:52,641 --> 00:05:56,243
<i>... who took it deep into the tunnels
of the Misty Mountains.</i>

54
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:59,412
<i>And there it consumed him.</i>

55
00:05:59,949 --> 00:06:01,640
It came to me.

56
00:06:02,184 --> 00:06:06,287
My own. My love. My own.

57
00:06:06,822 --> 00:06:11,186
My precious.

58
00:06:15,164 --> 00:06:18,265
<i>The Ring brought to Gollum
unnatural long life.</i>

59
00:06:18,801 --> 00:06:22,301
<i>For 500 years it poisoned his mind.</i>

60
00:06:22,838 --> 00:06:27,100
<i>And in the gloom of Gollum's cave,
it waited.</i>

61
00:06:27,643 --> 00:06:30,540
<i>Darkness crept back
into the forests of the world.</i>

62
00:06:31,147 --> 00:06:33,645
<i>Rumor grew of a shadow in the East...</i>

63
00:06:34,183 --> 00:06:36,647
<i>... whispers of a nameless fear.</i>

64
00:06:37,186 --> 00:06:40,151
<i>And the Ring of Power perceived...</i>

65
00:06:40,689 --> 00:06:43,153
<i>... its time had now come.</i>

66
00:06:45,928 --> 00:06:48,222
<i>It abandoned Gollum.</i>

67
00:06:49,265 --> 00:06:53,402
<i>But something happened then
the Ring did not intend.</i>

68
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:58,832
<i>It was picked up by the most unlikely
creature imaginable.</i>

69
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:00,099
What's this?

70
00:07:00,643 --> 00:07:01,742
<i>A Hobbit.</i>

71
00:07:02,278 --> 00:07:04,674
<i>Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.</i>

72
00:07:05,214 --> 00:07:06,643
A ring.

73
00:07:07,183 --> 00:07:08,714
Lost!

74
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:14,921
My precious is lost!

75
00:07:15,491 --> 00:07:17,455
<i>For the time will soon come...</i>

76
00:07:18,027 --> 00:07:22,858
<i>... when Hobbits will shape
the fortunes of all.</i>

77
00:07:38,781 --> 00:07:42,941
The Shire... 60 years later

78
00:07:45,688 --> 00:07:48,880
<i>Down from the door where it began</i>

79
00:07:54,063 --> 00:07:57,529
<i>And I must follow if I can</i>

80
00:07:58,867 --> 00:08:02,663
<i>The road goes ever on and on</i>

81
00:08:03,205 --> 00:08:06,341
<i>Down from the door where it began</i>

82
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:11,512
<i>Now far ahead the road has gone</i>

83
00:08:12,514 --> 00:08:15,911
<i>- And I must follow if I can
- You're late.</i>

84
00:08:19,555 --> 00:08:23,021
A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins.

85
00:08:24,126 --> 00:08:28,422
Nor is he early. He arrives
precisely when he means to.

86
00:08:40,109 --> 00:08:42,835
It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!

87
00:08:47,082 --> 00:08:50,445
You didn't think I'd miss
your Uncle Bilbo's birthday?

88
00:08:52,421 --> 00:08:54,749
What news of the outside world?
Tell me everything.

89
00:08:55,324 --> 00:08:58,755
Everything? You're far too eager
and curious for a Hobbit.

90
00:08:59,561 --> 00:09:00,353
Most unnatural.

91
00:09:03,232 --> 00:09:04,399
Well, what can I tell you?

92
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:08,969
Life in the wide world goes on
much as it has this past Age.

93
00:09:09,505 --> 00:09:11,799
Full of its own comings and goings.

94
00:09:12,341 --> 00:09:14,874
Scarcely aware of the existence
of Hobbits.

95
00:09:15,944 --> 00:09:18,135
For which I am very thankful.

96
00:09:23,052 --> 00:09:25,118
It's Gandalf!

97
00:09:37,433 --> 00:09:40,330
The long-expected party.

98
00:09:46,775 --> 00:09:48,136
How is the old rascal?

99
00:09:48,677 --> 00:09:51,744
I hear it's going to be a party
of special magnificence.

100
00:09:52,247 --> 00:09:54,939
You know Bilbo.
He's got the whole place in an uproar.

101
00:09:55,451 --> 00:09:56,846
Well, that should please him.

102
00:09:57,386 --> 00:09:59,418
- Half the Shire's been invited.
- Gracious me.

103
00:09:59,955 --> 00:10:01,452
- He's up to something.
- Oh, really?

104
00:10:01,957 --> 00:10:03,682
All right, then. Keep your secrets.

105
00:10:04,259 --> 00:10:06,325
Before you came along, we Bagginses
were very well thought of.

106
00:10:06,829 --> 00:10:07,291
Indeed.

107
00:10:07,796 --> 00:10:09,691
Never had any adventures
or did anything unexpected.

108
00:10:10,632 --> 00:10:16,168
If you're referring to the incident
with the dragon, I was barely involved.

109
00:10:16,705 --> 00:10:19,932
All I did was give your uncle
a little nudge out of the door.

110
00:10:20,476 --> 00:10:24,237
Whatever you did, you've been officially
labeled a disturber of the peace.

111
00:10:24,947 --> 00:10:26,512
Oh, really?

112
00:10:32,521 --> 00:10:34,086
Gandalf! Gandalf!

113
00:10:40,596 --> 00:10:41,456
Fireworks, Gandalf!

114
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,194
- Gandalf!
- Fireworks, Gandalf!

115
00:11:06,121 --> 00:11:06,845
Gandalf?

116
00:11:07,756 --> 00:11:11,483
- I'm glad you're back.
- So am I, dear boy.

117
00:11:15,931 --> 00:11:17,428
So am I.

118
00:11:49,598 --> 00:11:50,697
No, thank you!

119
00:11:51,233 --> 00:11:54,835
We don't want any more visitors,
well-wishers or distant relations!

120
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:58,562
And what about very old friends?

121
00:12:02,044 --> 00:12:03,439
Gandalf?

122
00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:07,571
- Bilbo Baggins.
- My dear Gandalf!

123
00:12:08,116 --> 00:12:12,879
Good to see you. 111 years old!
Who would believe it?

124
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:16,658
You haven't aged a day.

125
00:12:23,665 --> 00:12:25,299
Come on, come in!

126
00:12:25,834 --> 00:12:27,866
Welcome, welcome.

127
00:12:29,371 --> 00:12:31,596
Oh, here we are.

128
00:12:33,609 --> 00:12:35,709
Tea? Or maybe something
a little stronger?

129
00:12:36,211 --> 00:12:39,677
I've got a few bottles
of the Old Winyard left. 1296.

130
00:12:40,215 --> 00:12:43,942
Very good year. Almost as old as I am.

131
00:12:45,454 --> 00:12:49,591
It was laid down by my father.
What say we open one, eh?

132
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:52,419
Just tea, thank you.

133
00:12:59,201 --> 00:13:00,493
I was expecting you sometime
last week.

134
00:13:01,036 --> 00:13:04,001
Not that it matters. You come and go as
you please. Always have and always will.

135
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:09,439
You caught me a bit unprepared. We've only
got cold chicken and a bit of pickle...

136
00:13:09,978 --> 00:13:13,011
There's some cheese here.
No, that won't do.

137
00:13:13,549 --> 00:13:17,117
We've got raspberry jam,
an apple tart...

138
00:13:18,153 --> 00:13:21,812
But not much for afters.
Oh, no, we're all right.

139
00:13:22,357 --> 00:13:24,855
I've just found some sponge cake.

140
00:13:28,063 --> 00:13:29,060
I could make you some eggs
if you'd...

141
00:13:33,235 --> 00:13:35,563
- Just tea, thank you.
- Oh, right.

142
00:13:37,005 --> 00:13:38,969
- You don't mind if I eat, do you?
- No, not at all.

143
00:13:40,409 --> 00:13:41,940
Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins!

144
00:13:42,477 --> 00:13:43,735
I'm not at home!

145
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:47,477
I've got to get away from these confounded
relatives, hanging on the bell all day...

146
00:13:48,016 --> 00:13:49,616
...never giving me a moment's peace.

147
00:13:50,152 --> 00:13:53,379
I want to see mountains again.
Mountains, Gandalf!

148
00:13:53,889 --> 00:13:58,117
And then find somewhere quiet
where I can finish my book. Oh, tea.

149
00:13:58,627 --> 00:14:02,263
- So you mean to go through with your plan?
- Yes, yes. It's all in hand.

150
00:14:02,764 --> 00:14:04,694
All the arrangements are made.

151
00:14:06,802 --> 00:14:08,367
Oh, thank you.

152
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,902
Frodo suspects something.

153
00:14:11,406 --> 00:14:13,574
Of course he does. He's a Baggins...

154
00:14:14,076 --> 00:14:16,370
...not some blockheaded Bracegirdle
from Hardbottle.

155
00:14:17,179 --> 00:14:19,712
You will tell him, won't you?

156
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:22,607
- Yes, yes.
- He's very fond of you.

157
00:14:25,153 --> 00:14:26,377
I know.

158
00:14:28,991 --> 00:14:32,092
He'd probably come with me
if I asked him.

159
00:14:33,028 --> 00:14:36,129
I think in his heart, Frodo's
still in love with the Shire.

160
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,032
The woods, the fields.

161
00:14:40,569 --> 00:14:42,567
Little rivers.

162
00:14:47,342 --> 00:14:49,704
I am old, Gandalf.

163
00:14:51,413 --> 00:14:56,346
I know I don't look it, but I'm
beginning to feel it in my heart.

164
00:14:58,854 --> 00:15:01,045
I feel thin.

165
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:02,951
Sort of stretched...

166
00:15:04,593 --> 00:15:07,558
...like butter scraped
over too much bread.

167
00:15:08,096 --> 00:15:12,256
I need a holiday. A very long holiday.

168
00:15:12,801 --> 00:15:15,664
And I don't expect I shall return.

169
00:15:18,206 --> 00:15:21,069
In fact, I mean not to.

170
00:15:24,112 --> 00:15:27,839
Old Toby. The finest weed
in the Southfarthing.

171
00:15:45,534 --> 00:15:47,794
Gandalf, my old friend...

172
00:15:48,303 --> 00:15:50,801
...this will be a night to remember.

173
00:16:13,929 --> 00:16:14,687
Hello, hello.

174
00:16:15,263 --> 00:16:18,990
Fatty Bolger. Lovely to see you.
Welcome, welcome.

175
00:16:20,368 --> 00:16:22,559
Go on, Sam. Ask Rosie for a dance.

176
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:28,732
- I think I'll just have another ale.
- Oh, no, you don't.

177
00:16:30,112 --> 00:16:31,575
Go on!

178
00:16:42,057 --> 00:16:43,554
So there I was...

179
00:16:44,092 --> 00:16:47,819
...at the mercy
of three monstrous trolls.

180
00:16:48,363 --> 00:16:50,031
And they were all arguing
amongst themselves...

181
00:16:50,565 --> 00:16:52,597
...about how they were
going to cook us.

182
00:16:53,135 --> 00:16:57,829
Whether it be turned on a spit, or to sit
on us one by one, squash us into jelly.

183
00:16:59,207 --> 00:17:02,399
They spent so much time arguing
the whithertos and the whyfors...

184
00:17:02,944 --> 00:17:06,171
...that the sun's first light
crept over the top of the trees...

185
00:17:07,516 --> 00:17:09,707
...and turned them all to stone!

186
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:16,389
Quickly.

187
00:17:20,862 --> 00:17:22,587
Up they go!

188
00:17:25,801 --> 00:17:26,661
No, the big one.

189
00:17:37,145 --> 00:17:38,870
- Done!
- You're supposed to stick it in the ground.

190
00:17:39,414 --> 00:17:40,581
- It is in the ground.
- Outside!

191
00:17:41,049 --> 00:17:42,376
This was your idea.

192
00:18:02,304 --> 00:18:03,596
Watch out for the dragon!

193
00:18:04,139 --> 00:18:07,172
Nonsense. There hasn't been a dragon
in these parts for a thousand years.

194
00:18:20,989 --> 00:18:24,250
- That was good.
- Let's get another one.

195
00:18:25,894 --> 00:18:30,088
Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took.

196
00:18:30,632 --> 00:18:32,163
I might've known.

197
00:18:38,373 --> 00:18:40,098
Speech, Bilbo!

198
00:18:41,343 --> 00:18:42,340
Speech!

199
00:18:42,844 --> 00:18:43,511
Speech!

200
00:18:49,217 --> 00:18:51,112
My dear Bagginses and Boffins...

201
00:18:52,254 --> 00:18:54,115
...Tooks and Brandybucks...

202
00:18:54,656 --> 00:18:56,824
...Grubbs, Chubbs...

203
00:18:57,359 --> 00:18:58,048
...Hornblowers...

204
00:18:59,561 --> 00:19:00,888
...Bolgers...

205
00:19:01,596 --> 00:19:02,820
...Bracegirdles...

206
00:19:03,365 --> 00:19:05,625
...and Proudfoots.
- Proudfeet!

207
00:19:08,169 --> 00:19:10,963
Today is my 111th birthday!

208
00:19:13,108 --> 00:19:14,332
Happy birthday!

209
00:19:14,876 --> 00:19:18,808
But alas, eleventy-one years is
far too short a time to live among...

210
00:19:19,347 --> 00:19:21,914
...such excellent
and admirable Hobbits.

211
00:19:23,184 --> 00:19:25,580
I don't know half of you
half as well as I should like...

212
00:19:26,121 --> 00:19:30,383
...and I like less than half of you
half as well as you deserve.

213
00:19:40,669 --> 00:19:42,735
I have things to do.

214
00:19:49,444 --> 00:19:51,237
I've put this off far too long.

215
00:19:55,417 --> 00:19:59,019
I regret to announce this is the end!

216
00:20:00,522 --> 00:20:01,348
I'm going now.

217
00:20:02,824 --> 00:20:05,357
I bid you all a very fond farewell.

218
00:20:08,096 --> 00:20:08,956
Goodbye.

219
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:45,324
I suppose you think
that was terribly clever.

220
00:20:45,867 --> 00:20:48,900
Come on, Gandalf.
Did you see their faces?

221
00:20:49,437 --> 00:20:54,131
There are many magic rings in this world,
and none of them should be used lightly.

222
00:20:54,676 --> 00:20:56,503
It was just a bit of fun.

223
00:20:57,045 --> 00:21:00,408
Oh, you're probably right, as usual.

224
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:05,342
- You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?
- Two eyes.

225
00:21:05,887 --> 00:21:08,215
As often as I can spare them.

226
00:21:08,757 --> 00:21:11,620
- I'm leaving everything to him.
- What about this ring of yours?

227
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,159
- Is that staying too?
- Yes, yes.

228
00:21:16,131 --> 00:21:19,665
It's in an envelope over there
on the mantelpiece.

229
00:21:21,069 --> 00:21:23,704
No. Wait, it's...

230
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:28,903
...here in my pocket.

231
00:21:33,715 --> 00:21:36,748
Isn't that? Isn't that odd, now?

232
00:21:38,753 --> 00:21:41,911
Yet, after all, why not?

233
00:21:43,825 --> 00:21:48,360
- Why shouldn't I keep it?
- I think you should leave the ring behind.

234
00:21:49,097 --> 00:21:50,958
Is that so hard?

235
00:21:51,499 --> 00:21:52,496
Well, no.

236
00:21:55,203 --> 00:21:56,393
And yes.

237
00:21:58,706 --> 00:22:01,432
Now it comes to it,
I don't feel like parting with it.

238
00:22:01,976 --> 00:22:03,405
It's mine. I found it! It came to me!

239
00:22:03,945 --> 00:22:07,809
- There's no need to get angry.
- Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault!

240
00:22:08,616 --> 00:22:10,079
It's mine.

241
00:22:11,686 --> 00:22:13,854
My own.

242
00:22:14,489 --> 00:22:18,148
- My precious.
- Precious?

243
00:22:18,693 --> 00:22:21,226
It's been called that before,
but not by you.

244
00:22:21,796 --> 00:22:24,021
What business is it of yours
what I do with my own things?

245
00:22:24,566 --> 00:22:26,962
I think you've had that ring
quite long enough.

246
00:22:27,502 --> 00:22:30,035
- You want it for yourself!
- Bilbo Baggins!

247
00:22:30,572 --> 00:22:34,470
Do not take me for some conjurer
of cheap tricks.

248
00:22:35,009 --> 00:22:38,338
I am not trying to rob you.

249
00:22:43,718 --> 00:22:45,079
I'm trying to help you.

250
00:22:53,862 --> 00:22:56,895
All your long years,
we've been friends.

251
00:22:57,632 --> 00:22:59,425
Trust me as you once did.

252
00:23:01,636 --> 00:23:03,133
Let it go.

253
00:23:04,539 --> 00:23:06,707
You're right, Gandalf.

254
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:11,472
The ring must go to Frodo.

255
00:23:13,148 --> 00:23:15,783
It's late. The road is long.

256
00:23:16,317 --> 00:23:18,485
Yes, it is time.

257
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:26,293
The ring is still in your pocket.

258
00:24:01,329 --> 00:24:04,021
I've thought up an ending for my book:

259
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,694
"And he lived happily ever after
to the end of his days."

260
00:24:11,206 --> 00:24:14,307
And I'm sure you will, my dear friend.

261
00:24:15,677 --> 00:24:16,776
Goodbye, Gandalf.

262
00:24:19,614 --> 00:24:22,181
Goodbye, dear Bilbo.

263
00:24:30,325 --> 00:24:34,223
<i>The road goes ever on and on</i>

264
00:24:37,098 --> 00:24:39,198
Until our next meeting.

265
00:25:06,828 --> 00:25:10,157
<i>It's mine. My own.</i>

266
00:25:10,665 --> 00:25:13,801
<i>My precious.</i>

267
00:25:14,402 --> 00:25:16,969
Riddles in the dark.

268
00:25:17,538 --> 00:25:18,637
Bilbo!

269
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,364
Bilbo!

270
00:25:24,312 --> 00:25:26,947
My precious.

271
00:25:28,883 --> 00:25:30,778
Precious.

272
00:25:31,286 --> 00:25:33,477
He's gone, hasn't he?

273
00:25:36,591 --> 00:25:39,317
He talked for so long about leaving...

274
00:25:39,861 --> 00:25:42,257
...I didn't think he'd really do it.

275
00:25:47,068 --> 00:25:48,633
Gandalf?

276
00:25:57,211 --> 00:25:58,572
Bilbo's ring.

277
00:25:59,247 --> 00:26:01,279
He's gone to stay with the Elves.

278
00:26:01,816 --> 00:26:04,576
He's left you Bag End.

279
00:26:08,523 --> 00:26:10,714
Along with all his possessions.

280
00:26:11,259 --> 00:26:13,826
The ring is yours now.

281
00:26:16,731 --> 00:26:19,923
- Put it somewhere out of sight.
- Where are you going?

282
00:26:20,435 --> 00:26:22,365
- There are some things that I must see to.
- What things?

283
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:26,836
- Questions. Questions that need answering.
- You've only just arrived.

284
00:26:28,042 --> 00:26:30,336
I don't understand.

285
00:26:33,981 --> 00:26:34,670
Neither do I.

286
00:26:38,252 --> 00:26:40,250
Keep it secret.

287
00:26:40,755 --> 00:26:42,218
Keep it safe.

288
00:27:17,558 --> 00:27:19,385
<i>Shire!</i>

289
00:27:20,027 --> 00:27:22,787
<i>Baggins!</i>

290
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,280

High King of Gondor...</i>

292
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:22,749
<i>... and the finding
of the Ring of Power."</i>

293
00:28:26,594 --> 00:28:28,091
<i>"It has come to me.</i>

295

<i>All those who follow in my bloodline
shall be bound to its fate...</i>

296
00:28:35,937 --> 00:28:39,403
<i>... for I will risk

297
00:28:39,941 --> 00:28:42,109
<i>It is precious to me...</i>

299

302
00:29:19,113 --> 00:29:21,748
Shire.

Baggins.

304
00:29:24,752 --> 00:29:28,479
There's no Bagginses around here.
They're all up in Hobbiton.

305
00:29:30,525 --> 00:29:31,692
That way.

306
00:29:38,933 --> 00:29:41,101
- Good night.
- Good night.

307
00:29:43,037 --> 00:29:44,204
Good night, Sam.

308
00:30:10,665 --> 00:30:12,833
Is it secret? Is it safe?

309
00:30:22,043 --> 00:30:23,836
What are you doing?

310
00:30:36,757 --> 00:30:38,982
Hold out your hand, Frodo.

311
00:30:39,527 --> 00:30:40,353
It's quite cool.

312
00:30:44,198 --> 00:30:45,627
What can you see?

313
00:30:47,735 --> 00:30:49,801
Can you see anything?

314
00:30:52,873 --> 00:30:53,904
Nothing.

315
00:30:54,909 --> 00:30:56,577
There's nothing.

316
00:30:57,979 --> 00:30:59,146
Wait.

317
00:31:03,584 --> 00:31:05,479
There are markings.

318
00:31:07,254 --> 00:31:10,390
It's some form of Elvish.
I can't read it.

319
00:31:10,925 --> 00:31:13,150
There are few who can.

320
00:31:14,061 --> 00:31:18,562
The language is that of Mordor,
which I will not utter here.

321
00:31:19,567 --> 00:31:20,234
Mordor!

322
00:31:20,835 --> 00:31:22,503
In the common tongue, it says:

323
00:31:23,037 --> 00:31:26,229
"One Ring to rule them all...

324
00:31:26,774 --> 00:31:28,772
...One Ring to find them...

325
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:31,171
...One Ring to bring them all...

326
00:31:31,779 --> 00:31:34,471
...and in the darkness bind them."

327
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:38,141
This is the One Ring...

328
00:31:38,686 --> 00:31:43,619
...forged by the Dark Lord Sauron
in the fires of Mount Doom.

329
00:31:44,158 --> 00:31:47,851
Taken by Isildur
from the hand of Sauron himself.

330
00:31:48,963 --> 00:31:51,188
Bilbo found it.

331
00:31:51,966 --> 00:31:53,600
- In Gollum's cave.
- Yes.

332
00:31:54,135 --> 00:31:58,329
For 60 years, the Ring lay quiet
in Bilbo's keeping...

333
00:31:58,873 --> 00:32:01,906
...prolonging his life,
delaying old age.

334
00:32:02,943 --> 00:32:06,977
But no longer, Frodo.
Evil is stirring in Mordor.

335
00:32:07,515 --> 00:32:09,615
The Ring has awoken.

336
00:32:10,151 --> 00:32:12,547
It's heard its master's call.

337
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,654
But he was destroyed.
Sauron was destroyed.

338
00:32:22,697 --> 00:32:24,456
No, Frodo.

339
00:32:25,733 --> 00:32:28,698
The spirit of Sauron endured.

340
00:32:29,236 --> 00:32:34,238
His life force is bound to the Ring,
and the Ring survived.

341
00:32:34,842 --> 00:32:36,703
Sauron has returned.

342
00:32:37,945 --> 00:32:39,704
His Orcs have multiplied.

343
00:32:40,247 --> 00:32:43,940
His fortress at Barad-dûr
is rebuilt in the land of Mordor.

344
00:32:44,485 --> 00:32:48,918
Sauron needs only this Ring to cover
all the lands in a second darkness.

345
00:32:49,457 --> 00:32:51,182
He is seeking it.

346
00:32:51,726 --> 00:32:55,260
Seeking it. All his thought
is bent on it.

347
00:32:55,796 --> 00:32:58,192
For the Ring yearns above all else...

348
00:32:58,733 --> 00:33:01,834
...to return to the hand
of its master.

349
00:33:02,369 --> 00:33:03,798
They are one...

350
00:33:04,338 --> 00:33:07,132
...the Ring and the Dark Lord.

351
00:33:07,675 --> 00:33:08,342
Frodo...

352
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:10,810
...he must never find it.

353
00:33:11,345 --> 00:33:12,012
All right.

354
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:16,646
We put it away. We keep it hidden.
We never speak of it again.

355
00:33:17,184 --> 00:33:19,478
No one knows it's here, do they?

356
00:33:25,526 --> 00:33:26,386
Do they, Gandalf?

357
00:33:27,762 --> 00:33:30,863
There is one other who knew
that Bilbo had the Ring.

358
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:35,091
I looked everywhere
for the creature Gollum.

359
00:33:35,636 --> 00:33:37,429
But the enemy found him first.

360
00:33:39,507 --> 00:33:41,675
<i>I don't know how long
they tortured him.</i>

361
00:33:42,176 --> 00:33:46,336
<i>But amidst the endless screams and
inane babble, they discerned two words:</i>

362
00:33:46,881 --> 00:33:48,674
Shire!

363
00:33:49,216 --> 00:33:50,474
Baggins!

364
00:33:51,018 --> 00:33:52,515
Shire.

365
00:33:53,053 --> 00:33:55,586
Baggins. But that would
lead them here!

366
00:33:58,659 --> 00:33:59,451
Who goes there?

367
00:34:01,562 --> 00:34:02,422
Take it, Gandalf!

368
00:34:03,164 --> 00:34:03,853
- Take it!
- No, Frodo.

369
00:34:04,398 --> 00:34:06,430
- You must take it!
- You cannot offer me this ring!

370
00:34:06,967 --> 00:34:09,966
- I'm giving it to you!
- Don't tempt me, Frodo!

371
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:13,734
I dare not take it.

372
00:34:14,375 --> 00:34:16,543
Not even to keep it safe.

373
00:34:17,945 --> 00:34:19,636
Understand, Frodo...

374
00:34:20,648 --> 00:34:23,943
...I would use this Ring
from a desire to do good.

375
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:35,056
But through me, it would wield a power
too great and terrible to imagine.

376
00:34:35,996 --> 00:34:38,597
- But it cannot stay in the Shire!
- No.

377
00:34:40,801 --> 00:34:42,059
No, it can't.

378
00:34:47,775 --> 00:34:48,806
What must I do?

379
00:34:50,811 --> 00:34:54,003
- You must leave. And leave quickly.
- Where? Where do I go?

380
00:34:54,548 --> 00:34:57,479
Get out of the Shire.
Make for the village of Bree.

381
00:34:58,085 --> 00:34:58,843
Bree.

382
00:34:59,386 --> 00:35:01,816
- What about you?
- I'll be waiting for you...

383
00:35:02,356 --> 00:35:04,524
...at the inn of the Prancing Pony.

384
00:35:05,025 --> 00:35:08,422
- And the Ring will be safe there?
- I don't know, Frodo.

385
00:35:08,963 --> 00:35:10,597
I don't have any answers.

386
00:35:12,466 --> 00:35:17,661
I must see the head of my order. He is
both wise and powerful. Trust me, Frodo.

387
00:35:18,205 --> 00:35:19,998
He'll know what to do.

388
00:35:20,941 --> 00:35:23,474
You'll have to leave the name
of Baggins behind you.

389
00:35:24,011 --> 00:35:26,179
That name is not safe
outside the Shire.

390
00:35:27,181 --> 00:35:30,146
Travel only by day.
And stay off the road.

391
00:35:31,118 --> 00:35:33,981
I can cut across country
easily enough.

392
00:35:36,824 --> 00:35:37,821
My dear Frodo.

393
00:35:38,425 --> 00:35:41,151
Hobbits really are amazing creatures.

394
00:35:41,662 --> 00:35:44,229
You can learn all that there is to
know about their ways in a month.

395
00:35:44,765 --> 00:35:46,797
And yet, after a hundred years...

396
00:35:47,334 --> 00:35:49,025
...they can still surprise you.

397
00:35:50,971 --> 00:35:51,968
Get down.

398
00:36:04,551 --> 00:36:07,709
Confound it all, Samwise Gamgee!
Have you been eavesdropping?

399
00:36:08,222 --> 00:36:12,382
I haven't been dropping no eaves. Honest.
I was cutting the grass under the window.

400
00:36:12,893 --> 00:36:15,061
A little late for trimming the verge,
don't you think?

401
00:36:15,529 --> 00:36:18,062
- I heard raised voices.
- What did you hear? Speak!

402
00:36:18,565 --> 00:36:19,357
Nothing important.

403
00:36:20,234 --> 00:36:23,995
That is, I heard a good deal about a ring,
a Dark Lord and the end of the world but...

404
00:36:24,505 --> 00:36:28,938
Please, Mr. Gandalf, sir, don't hurt me.
Don't turn me into anything unnatural.

405
00:36:29,977 --> 00:36:31,269
No?

406
00:36:32,813 --> 00:36:33,605
Perhaps not.

407
00:36:35,215 --> 00:36:38,282
I've thought of a better use for you.

408
00:36:40,387 --> 00:36:43,056
Come along, Samwise. Keep up.

409
00:36:44,858 --> 00:36:46,753
Be careful, both of you.

410
00:36:47,361 --> 00:36:49,791
The enemy has many spies
in his service:

411
00:36:50,397 --> 00:36:52,964
Birds, beasts.

412
00:36:55,069 --> 00:36:56,566
Is it safe?

413
00:36:58,572 --> 00:36:59,603
Never put it on...

414
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:03,207
...for the agents of the Dark Lord
will be drawn to its power.

415
00:37:03,744 --> 00:37:04,911
Always remember, Frodo...

416
00:37:05,746 --> 00:37:08,574
...the Ring is trying to get back
to its master.

417
00:37:09,283 --> 00:37:11,076
It wants to be found.

418
00:37:51,992 --> 00:37:53,853
This is it.

419
00:37:54,528 --> 00:37:56,321
This is what?

420
00:37:56,997 --> 00:37:58,722
If I take one more step...

421
00:37:59,566 --> 00:38:03,100
...it'll be the farthest away
from home I've ever been.

422
00:38:07,674 --> 00:38:08,841
Come on, Sam.

423
00:38:17,618 --> 00:38:19,149
Remember what Bilbo used to say:

424
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:23,486
<i>- "It's a dangerous business, Frodo."
- "Going out your door.</i>

425
00:38:23,991 --> 00:38:28,094
<i>You step onto the road,
and if you don't keep your feet...</i>

426
00:38:28,595 --> 00:38:32,425
<i>... there's no knowing where
you might be swept off to."</i>

427
00:38:57,057 --> 00:38:59,783
<i>Smoke rises
from the Mountain of Doom.</i>

428
00:39:00,294 --> 00:39:01,621
<i>The hour grows late.</i>

429
00:39:02,129 --> 00:39:05,390
<i>And Gandalf the Grey
rides to Isengard...</i>

430
00:39:05,933 --> 00:39:08,033
<i>... seeking my counsel.</i>

431
00:39:08,569 --> 00:39:12,228
For that is why you have come,
is it not?

432
00:39:12,739 --> 00:39:13,701
My old friend.

433
00:39:14,308 --> 00:39:15,566
Saruman.

434
00:39:20,681 --> 00:39:23,373
- You are sure of this?
- Beyond any doubt.

435
00:39:24,518 --> 00:39:26,482
So the Ring of Power has been found.

436
00:39:26,987 --> 00:39:29,850
All these long years,
it was in the Shire.

437
00:39:30,424 --> 00:39:33,287
- Under my very nose.
- Yet you did not have the wit to see it.

438
00:39:34,194 --> 00:39:38,297
Your love of the halfling's leaf
has clearly slowed your mind.

439
00:39:39,333 --> 00:39:43,197
But we still have time. Time enough
to counter Sauron if we act quickly.

440
00:39:43,737 --> 00:39:44,904
Time?

441
00:39:46,173 --> 00:39:48,467
What time do you think we have?

442
00:39:49,243 --> 00:39:52,777
Sauron has regained
much of his former strength.

443
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,175
He cannot yet take physical form...

444
00:39:55,682 --> 00:39:58,078
...but his spirit has lost
none of its potency.

445
00:39:59,086 --> 00:40:03,814
Concealed within his fortress,
the Lord of Mordor sees all.

446
00:40:04,691 --> 00:40:10,330
His gaze pierces cloud, shadow,
earth and flesh.

447
00:40:12,166 --> 00:40:14,960
You know of what I speak, Gandalf.

448
00:40:16,203 --> 00:40:21,136
A Great Eye, lidless,
wreathed in flame.

449
00:40:22,442 --> 00:40:23,871
The Eye of Sauron.

450
00:40:24,444 --> 00:40:26,669
He is gathering all evil to him.

451
00:40:27,214 --> 00:40:31,749
Very soon, he'll have summoned an army
great enough for an assault upon Middle-earth.

452
00:40:32,419 --> 00:40:34,485
You know this?

453
00:40:35,355 --> 00:40:36,522
How?

454
00:40:37,424 --> 00:40:38,751
I have seen it.

455
00:40:39,526 --> 00:40:42,389
A palantír is a dangerous tool,
Saruman.

456
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:44,597
Why?

457
00:40:45,399 --> 00:40:47,795
Why should we fear to use it?

458
00:40:50,737 --> 00:40:54,396
They are not all accounted for,
the lost Seeing-stones.

459
00:40:54,908 --> 00:40:57,771
We do not know who else
may be watching.

460
00:41:00,714 --> 00:41:03,110
The hour is later than you think.

461
00:41:03,617 --> 00:41:05,649
Sauron's forces are already moving.

462
00:41:08,222 --> 00:41:10,652
The Nine have left Minas Morgul.

463
00:41:11,391 --> 00:41:12,058
The Nine?

464
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:15,285
They crossed the River Isen
on Midsummer's Eve...

465
00:41:15,796 --> 00:41:18,158
...disguised as riders in black.

466
00:41:18,699 --> 00:41:22,335
- They've reached the Shire?
- They will find the Ring.

467
00:41:24,271 --> 00:41:26,132
And kill the one who carries it.

468
00:41:27,007 --> 00:41:28,174
Frodo!

469
00:41:41,088 --> 00:41:45,157
You did not seriously think that a Hobbit
could contend with the will of Sauron?

470
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:48,724
There are none who can.

471
00:41:51,565 --> 00:41:53,961
Against the power of Mordor...

472
00:41:54,468 --> 00:41:56,762
...there can be no victory.

473
00:41:59,072 --> 00:42:01,900
We must join with him, Gandalf.

474
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:05,542
We must join with Sauron.

475
00:42:08,515 --> 00:42:10,843
It would be wise, my friend.

476
00:42:11,652 --> 00:42:12,842
Tell me...

477
00:42:13,353 --> 00:42:14,020
...friend...

478
00:42:15,355 --> 00:42:19,583
...when did Saruman the Wise
abandon reason for madness?

479
00:42:59,433 --> 00:43:00,794
I gave you the chance...

480
00:43:02,235 --> 00:43:04,597
...of aiding me willingly...

481
00:43:05,105 --> 00:43:08,935
...but you have elected
the way of pain!

482
00:43:32,566 --> 00:43:33,733
Mr. Frodo?

483
00:43:34,668 --> 00:43:36,131
Frodo? Frodo!

484
00:43:37,871 --> 00:43:40,768
- I thought I'd lost you.
- What are you talking about?

485
00:43:41,274 --> 00:43:43,966
- It's just something Gandalf said.
- What did he say?

486
00:43:45,112 --> 00:43:48,680
"Don't you lose him, Samwise Gamgee."
And I don't mean to.

487
00:43:49,249 --> 00:43:52,544
Sam, we're still in the Shire.
What could possibly happen?

488
00:43:55,889 --> 00:43:56,556
Frodo.

489
00:43:57,124 --> 00:43:59,054
- Merry, it's Frodo Baggins.
- Hello, Frodo.

490
00:43:59,593 --> 00:44:00,658
Get off him.

491
00:44:01,495 --> 00:44:02,662
Come on, Frodo.

492
00:44:03,163 --> 00:44:04,694
What's the meaning of this?

493
00:44:05,465 --> 00:44:08,225
You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop!

494
00:44:09,736 --> 00:44:11,529
You get back here!

495
00:44:12,873 --> 00:44:13,870
Get out of my field!

496
00:44:14,374 --> 00:44:16,872
You know what's gonna happen
when I catch up with you?

497
00:44:17,411 --> 00:44:20,046
I don't know why he's so upset.
It's only a couple of carrots.

498
00:44:20,547 --> 00:44:21,339
And some cabbages.

499
00:44:21,848 --> 00:44:24,449
And those three bags of potatoes
that we lifted last week.

500
00:44:24,951 --> 00:44:28,678
- And then the mushrooms the week before.
- Yes, Pippin. My point is...

501
00:44:29,222 --> 00:44:31,049
...he's clearly overreacting.

502
00:44:31,591 --> 00:44:32,758
Run!

503
00:44:46,804 --> 00:44:48,995
Oh, that was close.

504
00:44:50,408 --> 00:44:53,202
I think I've broken something.

505
00:44:54,545 --> 00:44:56,577
Trust a Brandybuck and a Took!

506
00:44:57,081 --> 00:45:00,410
What? That was just a detour.
A shortcut.

507
00:45:00,918 --> 00:45:02,848
- Shortcut to what?
- Mushrooms!

508
00:45:11,962 --> 00:45:13,129
That's mine.

509
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,492
That's nice, Merry.

510
00:45:18,369 --> 00:45:20,060
Here's a nice one, Sam.

511
00:45:20,571 --> 00:45:22,796
I think we should get off the road.

512
00:45:32,316 --> 00:45:33,347
Get off the road!

513
00:45:33,884 --> 00:45:35,051
Quick!

514
00:45:48,065 --> 00:45:49,232
Be quiet!

515
00:46:55,866 --> 00:46:57,693
What was that?

516
00:47:30,734 --> 00:47:31,901
Anything?

517
00:47:32,937 --> 00:47:34,104
Nothing.

518
00:47:35,139 --> 00:47:37,069
What is going on?

519
00:47:37,975 --> 00:47:41,441
That Black Rider was looking
for something. Or someone.

520
00:47:45,249 --> 00:47:45,916
Get down!

521
00:48:03,234 --> 00:48:05,095
I have to leave the Shire.

522
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:08,468
Sam and I must get to Bree.

523
00:48:08,973 --> 00:48:10,072
Right.

524
00:48:11,809 --> 00:48:13,704
Bucklebury Ferry. Follow me.

525
00:48:22,353 --> 00:48:23,350
Run!

526
00:48:24,889 --> 00:48:26,557
This way! Follow me!

527
00:48:30,461 --> 00:48:31,185
Run!

528
00:48:44,842 --> 00:48:46,237
Get the rope, Sam!

529
00:48:49,213 --> 00:48:50,403
Frodo!

530
00:48:51,448 --> 00:48:52,547
Run, Frodo!

531
00:48:53,217 --> 00:48:53,975
Go!
- Hurry!

532
00:48:54,485 --> 00:48:56,779
Frodo, come on!

533
00:48:58,055 --> 00:48:59,746
- Come on! Faster!
- Jump!

534
00:49:15,005 --> 00:49:18,903
- How far to the nearest crossing?
- The Brandywine Bridge. 20 miles.

535
00:49:33,824 --> 00:49:34,991
Come on.

536
00:49:46,503 --> 00:49:49,639
- What do you want?
- We're heading for the Prancing Pony.

537
00:49:53,444 --> 00:49:55,977
Hobbits. Four Hobbits!

538
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:59,547
- What business brings you to Bree?
- We wish to stay at the inn.

539
00:50:00,050 --> 00:50:01,775
Our business is our own.

540
00:50:02,286 --> 00:50:04,477
All right, young sir.
I meant no offense.

541
00:50:04,989 --> 00:50:07,180
It's my job to ask questions
after nightfall.

542
00:50:07,691 --> 00:50:10,224
There's talk of strange folk abroad.

543
00:50:10,728 --> 00:50:12,555
Can't be too careful.

544
00:50:32,616 --> 00:50:35,752
Out of the way!
Watch where you're walking.

545
00:51:00,110 --> 00:51:01,402
Excuse me.

546
00:51:02,813 --> 00:51:04,344
Good evening, little masters.

547
00:51:04,948 --> 00:51:09,381
If you're seeking accommodation, we got
some cozy Hobbit-sized rooms available.

548
00:51:09,887 --> 00:51:11,487
Mister?

549
00:51:13,123 --> 00:51:14,848
Underhill. My name's Underhill.

550
00:51:16,427 --> 00:51:18,652
- Underhill, yes.
- We're friends of Gandalf the Grey.

551
00:51:19,163 --> 00:51:21,991
- Can you tell him we've arrived?
- Gandalf?

552
00:51:22,733 --> 00:51:24,162
Gandalf.

553
00:51:25,269 --> 00:51:26,664
Oh, yes...

554
00:51:27,204 --> 00:51:28,963
...I remember. Elderly chap.

555
00:51:29,606 --> 00:51:32,241
Big grey beard, pointy hat.

556
00:51:32,943 --> 00:51:34,440
Not seen him for six months.

557
00:51:41,585 --> 00:51:42,547
What do we do now?

558
00:51:50,094 --> 00:51:51,022
Sam...

559
00:51:51,528 --> 00:51:53,059
...he'll be here. He'll come.

560
00:51:56,133 --> 00:51:57,892
Get out of my way!

561
00:52:00,604 --> 00:52:01,931
What's that?

562
00:52:02,439 --> 00:52:04,630
This, my friend, is a pint.

563
00:52:05,142 --> 00:52:06,434
It comes in pints?

564
00:52:07,144 --> 00:52:10,507
- I'm getting one.
- You got a whole half already!

565
00:52:17,187 --> 00:52:20,721
That fellow's done nothing
but stare at you since we arrived.

566
00:52:24,595 --> 00:52:25,762
Excuse me.

567
00:52:27,898 --> 00:52:30,567
That Man in the corner. Who is he?

568
00:52:32,035 --> 00:52:36,104
He's one of them Rangers. They're
dangerous folk, wandering the Wilds.

569
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:40,877
What his right name is, I've never heard,
but around here he's known as Strider.

570
00:52:43,614 --> 00:52:44,474
Strider.

571
00:52:57,861 --> 00:53:00,758
<i>Baggins.</i>

572
00:53:04,535 --> 00:53:05,725
<i>Baggins.</i>

573
00:53:18,415 --> 00:53:20,345
Baggins? Sure, I know a Baggins.

574
00:53:21,485 --> 00:53:24,018
He's over there. Frodo Baggins.

575
00:53:24,521 --> 00:53:27,281
He's my second cousin,
once removed on his mother's side...

576
00:53:27,791 --> 00:53:29,686
...and my third cousin, twice removed...

577
00:53:34,531 --> 00:53:35,994
- Pippin!
- Steady on, Frodo.

578
00:54:05,862 --> 00:54:08,030
You cannot hide.

579
00:54:11,268 --> 00:54:14,062
I see you.

580
00:54:16,106 --> 00:54:18,468
There is no life...

581
00:54:18,976 --> 00:54:20,871
...in the void.

582
00:54:21,378 --> 00:54:22,545
Only...

583
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:24,947
...death.

584
00:54:31,288 --> 00:54:35,823
You draw far too much attention
to yourself, "Mr. Underhill."

585
00:54:40,831 --> 00:54:41,498
What do you want?

586
00:54:41,999 --> 00:54:43,758
A little more caution from you.
That is no trinket you carry.

587
00:54:44,501 --> 00:54:47,193
- I carry nothing.
- Indeed.

588
00:54:47,804 --> 00:54:49,995
I can avoid being seen if I wish...

589
00:54:50,507 --> 00:54:53,904
...but to disappear entirely,
that is a rare gift.

590
00:54:54,745 --> 00:54:57,005
- Who are you?
- Are you frightened?

591
00:54:58,615 --> 00:54:59,282
Yes.

592
00:54:59,783 --> 00:55:03,385
Not nearly frightened enough.
I know what hunts you.

593
00:55:07,691 --> 00:55:09,916
Let him go!
Or I'll have you, Longshanks.

594
00:55:11,928 --> 00:55:15,724
You have a stout heart, little Hobbit.
But that will not save you.

595
00:55:16,233 --> 00:55:18,834
You can no longer wait
for the wizard, Frodo.

596
00:55:19,336 --> 00:55:20,094
They're coming.

597
00:56:42,619 --> 00:56:43,786
What are they?

598
00:56:46,289 --> 00:56:48,082
They were once Men.

599
00:56:48,658 --> 00:56:50,519
Great kings of Men.

600
00:56:51,027 --> 00:56:53,855
Then Sauron the Deceiver gave to them
nine rings of power.

601
00:56:54,798 --> 00:56:57,592
Blinded by their greed,
they took them without question.

602
00:56:58,168 --> 00:57:01,133
One by one, falling into darkness.

603
00:57:01,638 --> 00:57:03,829
Now they are slaves to his will.

604
00:57:06,543 --> 00:57:07,904
They are the Nazgûl.

605
00:57:08,445 --> 00:57:10,841
Ringwraiths. Neither living nor dead.

606
00:57:11,915 --> 00:57:13,082
At all times they feel...

607
00:57:13,550 --> 00:57:15,184
<i>... the presence of the Ring...</i>

608
00:57:15,685 --> 00:57:19,879
<i>... drawn to the power of the One.
They will never stop hunting you.</i>

609
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:32,801
- Where are you taking us?
- Into the Wild.

610
00:57:36,273 --> 00:57:40,000
How do we know this Strider
is a friend of Gandalf?

611
00:57:40,944 --> 00:57:43,477
We have no choice but to trust him.

612
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:47,081
- But where is he leading us?
- To Rivendell, Master Gamgee.

613
00:57:47,584 --> 00:57:50,515
- To the house of Elrond.
- Did you hear that? Rivendell.

614
00:57:51,455 --> 00:57:53,885
<i>We're going to see the Elves.</i>

615
00:58:12,242 --> 00:58:16,140
- Gentlemen, we do not stop till nightfall.
- What about breakfast?

616
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:19,042
- You've already had it.
- We've had one, yes.

617
00:58:19,583 --> 00:58:21,444
What about second breakfast?

618
00:58:25,188 --> 00:58:28,016
Don't think he knows
about second breakfast, Pip.

619
00:58:28,558 --> 00:58:33,457
What about elevenses? Luncheon?
Afternoon tea? Dinner? Supper?

620
00:58:33,997 --> 00:58:37,827
- He knows about them, doesn't he?
- I wouldn't count on it.

621
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:44,898
Pippin!

622
00:58:48,545 --> 00:58:52,306
<i>The power of Isengard
is at your command...</i>

623
00:58:52,849 --> 00:58:56,952
<i>... Sauron, Lord of the Earth.</i>

624
00:59:00,624 --> 00:59:06,058
<i>Build me an army worthy of Mordor.</i>

625
00:59:12,002 --> 00:59:16,139
What orders from Mordor, my lord?
What does the Eye command?

626
00:59:16,907 --> 00:59:18,507
We have work to do.

627
01:00:01,484 --> 01:00:05,814
The trees are strong, my lord.
Their roots go deep.

628
01:00:06,523 --> 01:00:08,054
Rip them all down.

629
01:00:35,785 --> 01:00:38,386
This was the great watchtower
of Amon Sûl.

630
01:00:40,423 --> 01:00:42,717
We shall rest here tonight.

631
01:00:54,704 --> 01:00:57,840
These are for you.
Keep them close.

632
01:00:58,375 --> 01:01:00,543
I'm going to have a look around.

633
01:01:03,246 --> 01:01:04,811
Stay here.

634
01:01:07,684 --> 01:01:09,545
My tomato's burst.

635
01:01:10,086 --> 01:01:11,651
Could I have some bacon?

636
01:01:12,188 --> 01:01:13,822
Want a tomato, Sam?

637
01:01:14,524 --> 01:01:17,887
- What are you doing?!
- Tomatoes, sausages, nice crispy bacon.

638
01:01:18,428 --> 01:01:20,756
- We saved some for you, Mr. Frodo.
- Put it out, you fools!

639
01:01:21,297 --> 01:01:24,956
- Put it out!
- That's nice! Ash on my tomatoes!

640
01:01:33,777 --> 01:01:35,138
Go!

641
01:02:28,965 --> 01:02:30,064
Back, you devils!

642
01:03:53,917 --> 01:03:54,777
Frodo!

643
01:03:59,856 --> 01:04:00,784
Oh, Sam.

644
01:04:38,094 --> 01:04:38,783
Strider!

645
01:04:41,865 --> 01:04:47,026
- Help him, Strider.
- He's been stabbed by a Morgul blade.

646
01:04:48,838 --> 01:04:53,475
This is beyond my skill to heal.
He needs Elvish medicine.

647
01:04:58,381 --> 01:04:59,048
Hurry!

648
01:04:59,582 --> 01:05:03,218
We're six days from Rivendell!
He'll never make it!

649
01:05:03,753 --> 01:05:05,318
Hold on, Frodo.

650
01:05:06,155 --> 01:05:06,822
Gandalf!

651
01:07:39,442 --> 01:07:42,009
Mr. Frodo? He's going cold.

652
01:07:45,214 --> 01:07:46,643
Is he going to die?

653
01:07:47,183 --> 01:07:51,718
He's passing into the Shadow World.
He'll soon become a Wraith like them.

654
01:07:57,160 --> 01:08:00,626
- They're close.
- Sam, do you know the Athelas plant?

655
01:08:01,164 --> 01:08:02,331
- Athelas?
- Kingsfoil.

656
01:08:02,832 --> 01:08:03,556
Kingsfoil, aye, it's a weed.

657
01:08:04,067 --> 01:08:06,930
It may help to slow the poisoning.
Hurry!

658
01:08:21,617 --> 01:08:25,515
What's this?
A Ranger caught off his guard?

659
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:51,347
Frodo.

660
01:08:53,683 --> 01:08:56,375
I am Arwen - I've come to help you.

661
01:08:59,188 --> 01:09:00,685
Hear my voice...

662
01:09:01,290 --> 01:09:03,083
Come back to the light.

663
01:09:08,598 --> 01:09:10,129
Who is she?

664
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:12,563
Frodo.

665
01:09:13,102 --> 01:09:16,260
- She's an Elf.
- He's fading.

666
01:09:18,875 --> 01:09:20,736
He's not going to last.

667
01:09:21,277 --> 01:09:23,605
We must get him to my father.

668
01:09:24,647 --> 01:09:27,214
- I've been looking for you for two days.
- Where are you taking him?

669
01:09:27,750 --> 01:09:33,514
There are five Wraiths behind you.
Where the other four are, I do not know.

670
01:09:34,891 --> 01:09:36,957
Stay with the Hobbits -
I'll send horses for you.

671
01:09:37,493 --> 01:09:38,820
I'm the faster rider - I'll take him.

672
01:09:40,062 --> 01:09:41,059
The Road is too dangerous.

673
01:09:41,597 --> 01:09:42,594
What are they saying?

674
01:09:43,132 --> 01:09:44,800
If I can get across the river...

675
01:09:45,334 --> 01:09:47,628
...the power of my people
will protect him.

676
01:09:49,038 --> 01:09:50,296
I do not fear them.

677
01:10:00,516 --> 01:10:01,581
Arwen...

678
01:10:02,118 --> 01:10:04,981
...ride hard. Don't look back.

679
01:10:10,359 --> 01:10:14,359
What are you doing?!
Those Wraiths are still out there!

680
01:12:09,345 --> 01:12:11,741
Give up the halfling, She-Elf.

681
01:12:13,015 --> 01:12:15,240
If you want him, come and claim him.

682
01:13:09,472 --> 01:13:11,640
No. No!

683
01:13:15,244 --> 01:13:17,174
Frodo, no.

684
01:13:17,713 --> 01:13:19,677
Frodo, don't give in.

685
01:13:20,216 --> 01:13:21,884
Not now.

686
01:13:33,129 --> 01:13:35,297
<i>What grace is given me...</i>

687
01:13:36,298 --> 01:13:37,829
<i>... let it pass to him.</i>

688
01:13:38,367 --> 01:13:40,194
<i>Let him be spared.</i>

689
01:13:41,137 --> 01:13:42,862
<i>Save him.</i>

690
01:13:55,618 --> 01:14:00,449
- Where am I?
- You are in the house of Elrond.

691
01:14:01,223 --> 01:14:07,385
And it is 10:00 in the morning
on October 24th, if you want to know.

692
01:14:09,665 --> 01:14:13,096
- Gandalf!
- Yes, I'm here.

693
01:14:15,137 --> 01:14:17,829
And you're lucky to be here too.

694
01:14:18,841 --> 01:14:22,534
A few more hours and you
would have been beyond our aid.

695
01:14:23,078 --> 01:14:26,839
But you have some strength in you,
my dear Hobbit.

696
01:14:34,824 --> 01:14:36,992
What happened, Gandalf?

697
01:14:38,260 --> 01:14:43,330
- Why didn't you meet us?
- I am sorry, Frodo.

698
01:14:48,370 --> 01:14:49,799
I was delayed.

699
01:14:51,006 --> 01:14:54,870
A friendship with Saruman
is not lightly thrown aside.

700
01:14:59,315 --> 01:15:03,611
One ill turn deserves another.
It is over.

701
01:15:04,286 --> 01:15:06,648
Embrace the power of the Ring...

702
01:15:07,556 --> 01:15:09,781
...or embrace your own destruction!

703
01:15:12,394 --> 01:15:15,962
There is only one Lord of the Ring.

704
01:15:16,499 --> 01:15:20,158
Only one who can bend it to his will.

705
01:15:21,370 --> 01:15:24,972
And he does not share power.

706
01:15:39,655 --> 01:15:42,654
So you have chosen death.

707
01:15:53,068 --> 01:15:56,534
Gandalf? What is it?

708
01:15:57,840 --> 01:15:59,303
Nothing, Frodo.

709
01:16:00,276 --> 01:16:01,876
Frodo!

710
01:16:03,579 --> 01:16:05,645
- Sam.
- Bless you, you're awake!

711
01:16:06,181 --> 01:16:08,577
Sam has hardly left your side.

712
01:16:09,118 --> 01:16:10,979
We were that worried about you.
Weren't we, Mr. Gandalf?

713
01:16:11,687 --> 01:16:16,450
By the skills of Lord Elrond,
you're beginning to mend.

714
01:16:18,327 --> 01:16:21,554
Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins.

715
01:17:09,979 --> 01:17:12,944
- Bilbo!
- Hello, Frodo, my lad.

716
01:17:13,449 --> 01:17:14,810
Bilbo.

717
01:17:20,022 --> 01:17:21,587
"There and Back Again:

718
01:17:22,124 --> 01:17:24,588
A Hobbit's Tale, by Bilbo Baggins."

719
01:17:27,997 --> 01:17:31,189
- This is wonderful.
- I meant to go back...

720
01:17:31,867 --> 01:17:35,333
...wonder at the powers of Mirkwood...

721
01:17:36,105 --> 01:17:38,103
...visit Lake-town...

722
01:17:38,641 --> 01:17:41,708
...see the Lonely Mountain again.

723
01:17:42,478 --> 01:17:47,081
But age, it seems,
has finally caught up with me.

724
01:17:59,528 --> 01:18:00,957
I miss the Shire.

725
01:18:01,697 --> 01:18:06,528
I spent all my childhood pretending
I was off somewhere else.

726
01:18:07,136 --> 01:18:10,431
Off with you,
on one of your adventures.

727
01:18:13,676 --> 01:18:16,971
But my own adventure turned out
to be quite different.

728
01:18:22,518 --> 01:18:25,381
I'm not like you, Bilbo.

729
01:18:26,889 --> 01:18:28,819
My dear boy.

730
01:18:33,262 --> 01:18:36,898
- Now, what have I forgotten?
- Packed already?

731
01:18:38,033 --> 01:18:39,496
No harm in being prepared.

732
01:18:40,035 --> 01:18:42,260
- I thought you wanted to see the Elves.
- I do.

733
01:18:42,805 --> 01:18:45,338
- More than anything.
- I did.

734
01:18:45,874 --> 01:18:47,439
It's just...

735
01:18:48,577 --> 01:18:50,837
We did what Gandalf wanted, didn't we?

736
01:18:51,380 --> 01:18:54,709
We got the Ring this far,
to Rivendell. And I thought...

737
01:18:55,250 --> 01:18:58,215
...seeing as how you're on the mend,
we'd be off soon.

738
01:18:58,754 --> 01:19:00,115
Off home.

739
01:19:04,626 --> 01:19:06,294
You are right, Sam.

740
01:19:08,797 --> 01:19:11,227
We did what we set out to do.

741
01:19:12,167 --> 01:19:14,358
The Ring will be safe in Rivendell.

742
01:19:18,841 --> 01:19:20,839
I am ready to go home.

743
01:19:21,910 --> 01:19:23,635
His strength returns.

744
01:19:24,179 --> 01:19:29,545
That wound will never fully heal.
He will carry it the rest of his life.

745
01:19:30,452 --> 01:19:32,643
And yet to have come so far
still bearing the Ring...

746
01:19:33,188 --> 01:19:36,551
...the Hobbit has shown extraordinary
resilience to its evil.

747
01:19:37,092 --> 01:19:40,125
It is a burden he should never
have had to bear.

748
01:19:40,662 --> 01:19:45,766
- We can ask no more of Frodo.
- Gandalf, the enemy is moving.

749
01:19:46,301 --> 01:19:50,631
Sauron's forces are massing in the East.
His Eye is fixed on Rivendell.

750
01:19:51,173 --> 01:19:53,603
And Saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us.

751
01:19:54,143 --> 01:19:57,040
Our list of allies grows thin.

752
01:19:58,113 --> 01:20:00,577
His treachery runs deeper
than you know.

753
01:20:01,116 --> 01:20:04,411
By foul craft, Saruman
has crossed Orcs with Goblin-men.

754
01:20:04,953 --> 01:20:07,121
He's breeding an army
in the caverns of Isengard.

755
01:20:07,723 --> 01:20:11,951
An army that can move in sunlight
and cover great distance at speed.

756
01:20:12,494 --> 01:20:14,560
Saruman is coming for the Ring.

757
01:20:15,297 --> 01:20:19,058
This evil cannot be concealed
by the power of the Elves.

758
01:20:19,601 --> 01:20:23,635
We do not have the strength
to fight both Mordor and Isengard!

759
01:20:27,776 --> 01:20:28,568
Gandalf...

760
01:20:30,212 --> 01:20:32,437
...the Ring cannot stay here.

761
01:20:52,301 --> 01:20:55,198
<i>This peril belongs
to all Middle-earth.</i>

762
01:20:55,737 --> 01:20:58,133
<i>They must decide now how to end it.</i>

763
01:20:59,541 --> 01:21:02,733
The time of the Elves is over.
My people are leaving these shores.

764
01:21:03,745 --> 01:21:07,006
Who will you look to when we've gone?
The Dwarves?

765
01:21:07,549 --> 01:21:12,312
They hide in mountains seeking riches.
They care not for the troubles of others.

766
01:21:14,289 --> 01:21:16,753
It is in Men
that we must place our hope.

767
01:21:17,426 --> 01:21:18,821
Men?

768
01:21:20,028 --> 01:21:22,925
Men are weak.
The race of Men is failing.

769
01:21:23,465 --> 01:21:27,534
The blood of Númenor is all but spent,
its pride and dignity forgotten.

770
01:21:28,237 --> 01:21:31,373
It is because of Men
the Ring survives.

771
01:21:31,907 --> 01:21:33,199
I was there, Gandalf.

772
01:21:34,209 --> 01:21:36,707
<i>I was there 3000 years ago...</i>

773
01:21:43,852 --> 01:21:45,952
<i>... when Isildur took the Ring.</i>

774
01:21:46,488 --> 01:21:50,022
I was there the day
the strength of Men failed.

775
01:21:52,895 --> 01:21:55,120
Isildur, hurry! Follow me.

776
01:21:57,065 --> 01:22:00,360
<i>I led Isildur into the heart
of Mount Doom...</i>

777
01:22:00,903 --> 01:22:04,130
<i>... where the Ring was forged,
the one place it could be destroyed.</i>

778
01:22:04,673 --> 01:22:06,898
Cast it into the fire!

779
01:22:12,381 --> 01:22:15,881
- Destroy it!
- No.

780
01:22:17,552 --> 01:22:19,379
Isildur!

781
01:22:20,188 --> 01:22:24,552
<i>It should have ended that day,
but evil was allowed to endure.</i>

782
01:22:29,031 --> 01:22:32,929
Isildur kept the Ring.
The line of kings is broken.

783
01:22:34,202 --> 01:22:37,497
There's no strength left
in the world of Men.

784
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:42,541
- They're scattered, divided, leaderless.
- There is one who could unite them.

785
01:22:43,078 --> 01:22:46,077
One who could reclaim
the throne of Gondor.

786
01:22:48,150 --> 01:22:51,581
He turned from that path
a long time ago.

787
01:22:52,120 --> 01:22:53,913
He has chosen exile.

788
01:23:27,122 --> 01:23:29,689
The shards of Narsil.

789
01:23:33,528 --> 01:23:37,665
The blade that cut the Ring
from Sauron's hand.

790
01:23:40,869 --> 01:23:42,799
It's still sharp.

791
01:23:52,047 --> 01:23:54,773
But no more than a broken heirloom.

792
01:24:21,910 --> 01:24:24,636
Why do you fear the past?

793
01:24:25,847 --> 01:24:30,883
You are Isildur's heir,
not Isildur himself.

794
01:24:31,420 --> 01:24:34,521
You are not bound to his fate.

795
01:24:35,390 --> 01:24:39,026
The same blood flows in my veins.

796
01:24:42,397 --> 01:24:44,588
The same weakness.

797
01:24:47,636 --> 01:24:50,100
Your time will come.

798
01:24:50,639 --> 01:24:54,742
You will face the same evil.
And you will defeat it.

799
01:24:58,246 --> 01:25:00,244
The Shadow does not hold sway yet.

800
01:25:01,650 --> 01:25:04,911
Not over you... not over me.

801
01:25:16,631 --> 01:25:19,494
Do you remember when we first met?

802
01:25:23,371 --> 01:25:27,531
I thought I had strayed into a dream.

803
01:25:28,477 --> 01:25:30,645
Long years have passed.

804
01:25:32,681 --> 01:25:35,680
You did not have the cares
you carry now.

805
01:25:37,519 --> 01:25:39,187
Do you remember what I told you?

806
01:25:45,594 --> 01:25:47,956
You said you'd bind yourself to me...

807
01:25:50,332 --> 01:25:54,969
...forsaking the immortal life
of your people.

808
01:25:56,404 --> 01:25:58,038
And to that I hold.

809
01:25:58,573 --> 01:26:01,834
I would rather share
one lifetime with you...

810
01:26:02,377 --> 01:26:05,911
...than face all the Ages
of this world alone.

811
01:26:15,023 --> 01:26:18,159
I choose a mortal life.

812
01:26:19,828 --> 01:26:23,760
- You cannot give me this.
- It is mine to give to whom I will...

813
01:26:27,302 --> 01:26:29,493
...like my heart.

814
01:26:45,587 --> 01:26:48,950
Strangers from distant lands,
friends of old...

815
01:26:49,491 --> 01:26:53,127
...you've been summoned here
to answer the threat of Mordor.

816
01:26:54,062 --> 01:26:58,631
Middle-earth stands upon the brink
of destruction. None can escape it.

817
01:26:59,167 --> 01:27:02,359
You will unite, or you will fall.

818
01:27:02,904 --> 01:27:06,836
Each race is bound to this fate,
this one doom.

819
01:27:09,044 --> 01:27:12,202
Bring forth the Ring, Frodo.

820
01:27:26,595 --> 01:27:27,956
So it is true.

821
01:27:41,676 --> 01:27:45,574
- The doom of Man.
- It is a gift.

822
01:27:47,115 --> 01:27:48,874
A gift to the foes of Mordor.

823
01:27:49,784 --> 01:27:51,952
Why not use this Ring?

824
01:27:52,754 --> 01:27:55,184
Long has my father,
the Steward of Gondor...

825
01:27:55,724 --> 01:27:59,485
...kept the forces of Mordor at bay.
By the blood of our people...

826
01:27:59,995 --> 01:28:01,925
...are your lands kept safe.

827
01:28:03,999 --> 01:28:08,068
Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy.
Let us use it against him.

828
01:28:08,603 --> 01:28:12,034
You cannot wield it.
None of us can.

829
01:28:12,941 --> 01:28:16,702
The One Ring answers to Sauron alone.
It has no other master.

830
01:28:17,245 --> 01:28:20,437
And what would a Ranger know
of this matter?

831
01:28:21,082 --> 01:28:22,750
This is no mere Ranger.

832
01:28:24,052 --> 01:28:27,381
He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

833
01:28:28,189 --> 01:28:30,790
You owe him your allegiance.

834
01:28:35,230 --> 01:28:36,795
Aragorn.

835
01:28:38,933 --> 01:28:41,363
This is Isildur's heir?

836
01:28:44,039 --> 01:28:46,469
And heir to the throne of Gondor.

837
01:28:48,877 --> 01:28:49,942
Sit down, Legolas.

838
01:28:53,682 --> 01:28:56,180
Gondor has no king.

839
01:28:58,386 --> 01:28:59,781
Gondor needs no king.

840
01:29:06,795 --> 01:29:10,124
Aragorn is right. We cannot use it.

841
01:29:11,466 --> 01:29:14,624
You have only one choice.

842
01:29:15,170 --> 01:29:17,168
The Ring must be destroyed.

843
01:29:22,744 --> 01:29:25,004
What are we waiting for?

844
01:29:37,459 --> 01:29:40,151
The Ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli,
son of Glóin...

845
01:29:40,695 --> 01:29:44,559
...by any craft that we here possess.

846
01:29:45,467 --> 01:29:49,228
The Ring was made in the fires
of Mount Doom.

847
01:29:49,771 --> 01:29:53,271
Only there can it be unmade.

848
01:29:54,709 --> 01:29:56,969
It must be taken deep into Mordor...

849
01:29:57,512 --> 01:30:02,149
...and cast back into the fiery chasm
from whence it came.

850
01:30:04,452 --> 01:30:06,143
One of you...

851
01:30:06,988 --> 01:30:08,815
...must do this.

852
01:30:12,060 --> 01:30:15,423
One does not simply walk into Mordor.

853
01:30:16,698 --> 01:30:19,993
Its Black Gates are guarded
by more than just Orcs.

854
01:30:21,136 --> 01:30:24,932
There is evil there
that does not sleep.

855
01:30:25,473 --> 01:30:29,405
The Great Eye is ever-watchful.

856
01:30:30,478 --> 01:30:32,203
It is a barren wasteland...

857
01:30:32,747 --> 01:30:36,008
...riddled with fire, and ash
and dust.

858
01:30:36,551 --> 01:30:40,051
The very air you breathe
is a poisonous fume.

859
01:30:40,588 --> 01:30:44,554
Not with 10,000 men
could you do this. It is folly.

860
01:30:45,093 --> 01:30:49,253
Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond
has said? The Ring must be destroyed.

861
01:30:49,764 --> 01:30:52,024
And I suppose you think
you are the one to do it!

862
01:30:52,567 --> 01:30:56,897
And if we fail, what then? What happens
when Sauron takes back what is his?

863
01:30:57,439 --> 01:31:02,338
I will be dead before I see the Ring
in the hands of an Elf!

864
01:31:04,712 --> 01:31:06,880
Never trust an Elf!

865
01:31:08,383 --> 01:31:13,851
Do you not understand? While you bicker
amongst yourselves, Sauron's power grows!

866
01:31:14,522 --> 01:31:17,089
None can escape it!
You'll all be destroyed!

867
01:31:36,177 --> 01:31:38,107
I will take it.

868
01:31:40,415 --> 01:31:42,606
I will take it.

869
01:31:48,756 --> 01:31:51,482
I will take the Ring to Mordor.

870
01:31:59,901 --> 01:32:00,829
Though...

871
01:32:04,305 --> 01:32:05,734
...I do not know the way.

872
01:32:08,142 --> 01:32:12,108
I will help you bear
this burden, Frodo Baggins...

873
01:32:12,647 --> 01:32:15,680
...as long as it is yours to bear.

874
01:32:17,151 --> 01:32:19,843
If by my life
or death I can protect you...

875
01:32:20,922 --> 01:32:21,953
...I will.

876
01:32:25,527 --> 01:32:27,491
You have my sword.

877
01:32:29,631 --> 01:32:31,356
And you have my bow.

878
01:32:32,300 --> 01:32:34,468
And my ax.

879
01:32:41,776 --> 01:32:44,468
You carry the fates
of us all, little one.

880
01:32:46,814 --> 01:32:50,143
If this is indeed
the will of the Council...

881
01:32:50,919 --> 01:32:53,087
...then Gondor will see it done.

882
01:32:55,957 --> 01:33:00,390
- Frodo's not going anywhere without me.
- It is hardly possible to separate you...

883
01:33:00,929 --> 01:33:05,498
...even when he is summoned
to a secret Council and you are not.

884
01:33:06,565 --> 01:33:08,130
We're coming too!

885
01:33:10,502 --> 01:33:12,932
You'll have to send us home
tied up in a sack to stop us.

886
01:33:13,472 --> 01:33:16,539
Anyway, you need people
of intelligence on this sort of...

887
01:33:17,209 --> 01:33:18,171
...mission.

888
01:33:18,710 --> 01:33:19,877
Quest.

889
01:33:20,645 --> 01:33:21,312
Thing.

890
01:33:23,548 --> 01:33:25,910
Well, that rules you out, Pip.

891
01:33:27,786 --> 01:33:29,386
Nine companions.

892
01:33:31,523 --> 01:33:32,986
So be it.

893
01:33:33,692 --> 01:33:36,384
You shall be
the Fellowship of the Ring.

894
01:33:37,362 --> 01:33:38,825
Great!

895
01:33:39,431 --> 01:33:41,326
Where are we going?

896
01:33:51,410 --> 01:33:52,236
<i>My old sword!</i>

897
01:33:52,911 --> 01:33:54,169
Sting.

898
01:33:54,713 --> 01:33:55,539
Here, take it. Take it.

899
01:34:01,420 --> 01:34:04,954
- It's so light.
- Yes. Made by the Elves, you know.

900
01:34:05,958 --> 01:34:09,788
The blade glows blue
when Orcs are close.

901
01:34:10,329 --> 01:34:14,591
And it's times like that, my lad,
when you have to be extra careful.

902
01:34:15,133 --> 01:34:17,301
Here's a pretty thing.

903
01:34:18,003 --> 01:34:18,965
Mithril.

904
01:34:20,072 --> 01:34:24,141
As light as a feather,
and as hard as dragon scales.

905
01:34:24,676 --> 01:34:27,607
Let me see you put it on. Come on.

906
01:34:35,988 --> 01:34:37,679
My old ring.

907
01:34:39,258 --> 01:34:42,860
I should very much like...

908
01:34:43,395 --> 01:34:47,088
...to hold it again, one last time.

909
01:35:04,816 --> 01:35:08,111
I'm sorry I brought this upon you,
my boy.

910
01:35:08,820 --> 01:35:12,547
I'm sorry that you
must carry this burden.

911
01:35:17,396 --> 01:35:20,156
I'm sorry for everything.

912
01:36:33,205 --> 01:36:37,308
<i>We must hold to this course, west
of the Misty Mountains, for 40 days.</i>

913
01:36:37,843 --> 01:36:41,274
<i>If our luck holds, the Gap of Rohan
will still be open to us.</i>

914
01:36:41,813 --> 01:36:45,040
<i>From there, our road
turns east to Mordor.</i>

915
01:36:45,584 --> 01:36:49,050
Two, one, five. Good! Very good.

916
01:36:51,123 --> 01:36:51,915
Move your feet.

917
01:36:52,457 --> 01:36:53,454
- You look good, Pippin.
- Thanks.

918
01:36:53,992 --> 01:36:55,091
Faster!

919
01:36:56,762 --> 01:37:00,228
If anyone was to ask for my opinion,
which I note they're not...

920
01:37:00,766 --> 01:37:03,162
...I'd say we were taking
the long way 'round.

921
01:37:04,002 --> 01:37:06,762
Gandalf, we could pass through
the Mines of Moria.

922
01:37:07,706 --> 01:37:11,274
My cousin Balin would give us
a royal welcome.

923
01:37:11,810 --> 01:37:16,812
No, I would not take the road through
Moria unless I had no other choice.

924
01:37:26,324 --> 01:37:27,150
Sorry!

925
01:37:28,193 --> 01:37:29,360
Get him!

926
01:37:31,163 --> 01:37:33,331
- For the Shire!
- Hold him. Hold him down, Merry!

927
01:37:33,832 --> 01:37:35,090
You've got my arm!
You've got my arm!

928
01:37:35,901 --> 01:37:38,195
- What is that?
- Nothing. It's just a wisp of cloud.

929
01:37:38,737 --> 01:37:41,133
It's moving fast.

930
01:37:41,707 --> 01:37:43,534
Against the wind.

931
01:37:44,609 --> 01:37:46,402
- Crebain from Dunland!
- Hide!

932
01:37:46,945 --> 01:37:49,375
- Hurry!
- Take cover!

933
01:38:23,115 --> 01:38:24,510
Spies of Saruman.

934
01:38:25,617 --> 01:38:28,548
The passage south is being watched.

935
01:38:30,021 --> 01:38:33,020
We must take the Pass of Caradhras.

936
01:38:45,971 --> 01:38:47,366
Frodo!

937
01:39:06,658 --> 01:39:08,622
Boromir.

938
01:39:09,161 --> 01:39:13,059
It is a strange fate that we should
suffer so much fear and doubt...

939
01:39:13,598 --> 01:39:16,392
...over so small a thing.

940
01:39:19,938 --> 01:39:21,572
Such a little thing.

941
01:39:22,107 --> 01:39:23,274
Boromir!

942
01:39:24,176 --> 01:39:26,504
Give the Ring to Frodo.

943
01:39:36,688 --> 01:39:38,379
As you wish.

944
01:39:39,457 --> 01:39:41,148
I care not.

945
01:40:16,862 --> 01:40:21,226
So, Gandalf, you tried
to lead them over Caradhras.

946
01:40:21,766 --> 01:40:26,028
And if that fails,
where then will you go?

947
01:40:27,672 --> 01:40:30,307
<i>If the mountain defeats you...</i>

948
01:40:30,842 --> 01:40:34,945
<i>... will you risk
a more dangerous road?</i>

949
01:40:47,659 --> 01:40:50,226
There is a fell voice on the air.

950
01:40:51,663 --> 01:40:52,830
It's Saruman!

951
01:41:02,073 --> 01:41:06,403
He's trying to bring down the mountain!
Gandalf, we must turn back!

952
01:41:06,945 --> 01:41:08,442
No!

953
01:42:15,213 --> 01:42:16,710
We must get off the mountain!

954
01:42:17,515 --> 01:42:21,549
Make for the Gap of Rohan,
and take the west road to my city!

955
01:42:22,087 --> 01:42:25,120
The Gap of Rohan takes us
too close to Isengard!

956
01:42:25,657 --> 01:42:29,020
We cannot pass over a mountain.
Let us go under it.

957
01:42:29,561 --> 01:42:32,094
Let us go through the Mines of Moria.

958
01:42:34,265 --> 01:42:37,731
<i>Moria. You fear to go
into those mines.</i>

959
01:42:38,737 --> 01:42:43,465
The Dwarves delved too greedily
and too deep.

960
01:42:44,609 --> 01:42:49,144
<i>You know what they awoke
in the darkness of Khazad-dûm:</i>

961
01:42:50,749 --> 01:42:53,941
Shadow and flame.

962
01:42:57,622 --> 01:43:00,018
Let the Ring-bearer decide.

963
01:43:05,697 --> 01:43:07,024
Frodo?

964
01:43:10,402 --> 01:43:12,935
We will go through the mines.

965
01:43:14,072 --> 01:43:15,672
So be it.

966
01:43:24,082 --> 01:43:25,113
The walls...

967
01:43:26,117 --> 01:43:27,876
...of Moria.

968
01:43:36,961 --> 01:43:39,960
Well, let's see.

969
01:43:40,498 --> 01:43:41,529
Ithildin.

970
01:43:42,500 --> 01:43:45,533
It mirrors only starlight
and moonlight.

971
01:43:59,918 --> 01:44:03,645
It reads, "The Doors of Durin,
Lord of Moria.

972
01:44:04,589 --> 01:44:08,885
- Speak, friend, and enter."
- What do you suppose that means?

973
01:44:09,427 --> 01:44:13,826
It's simple. If you are a friend, you speak
the password and the doors will open.

974
01:44:45,363 --> 01:44:47,588
Mines are no place for a pony.

975
01:44:48,133 --> 01:44:51,894
- Even one so brave as Bill.
- Bye-bye, Bill.

976
01:44:53,404 --> 01:44:55,834
Go on, Bill. Go on.

977
01:44:56,741 --> 01:44:59,933
Don't worry, Sam,
he knows the way home.

978
01:45:07,051 --> 01:45:09,311
Do not disturb the water.

979
01:45:09,854 --> 01:45:11,419
Oh, it's useless.

980
01:45:24,402 --> 01:45:26,263
It's a riddle.

981
01:45:29,340 --> 01:45:32,134
"Speak 'friend' and enter."

982
01:45:32,844 --> 01:45:35,411
What's the Elvish word for "friend"?

983
01:45:37,215 --> 01:45:38,177
<i>Mellon.</i>

984
01:45:56,568 --> 01:46:01,103
Soon, Master Elf, you will enjoy
the fabled hospitality of the Dwarves.

985
01:46:01,906 --> 01:46:07,272
Roaring fires, malt beer,
ripe meat off the bone!

986
01:46:09,147 --> 01:46:11,873
This, my friend,
is the home of my cousin Balin.

987
01:46:12,550 --> 01:46:14,650
And they call it a mine.

988
01:46:15,186 --> 01:46:16,786
A mine!

989
01:46:18,189 --> 01:46:21,188
This is no mine. It's a tomb.

990
01:46:27,665 --> 01:46:28,889
No...

991
01:46:30,501 --> 01:46:31,793
No!

992
01:46:34,772 --> 01:46:35,996
Goblins.

993
01:46:40,245 --> 01:46:44,211
We make for the Gap of Rohan.
We should never have come here.

994
01:46:45,583 --> 01:46:47,843
Now, get out of here. Get out!

995
01:46:50,955 --> 01:46:53,021
- Frodo!
- Help!

996
01:46:53,558 --> 01:46:54,816
Strider!

997
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:57,824
- Help!
- Get off him!

998
01:46:58,363 --> 01:46:59,030
Aragorn!

999
01:47:09,774 --> 01:47:10,441
Frodo!

1000
01:47:37,135 --> 01:47:37,859
Into the mines!

1001
01:47:38,403 --> 01:47:41,266
- Legolas!
- Into the cave!

1002
01:47:45,877 --> 01:47:47,306
Run!

1003
01:48:04,862 --> 01:48:07,793
We now have but one choice.

1004
01:48:08,333 --> 01:48:12,868
We must face the long dark of Moria.

1005
01:48:13,471 --> 01:48:15,105
Be on your guard.

1006
01:48:15,640 --> 01:48:18,741
There are older
and fouler things than Orcs...

1007
01:48:19,277 --> 01:48:22,469
...in the deep places of the world.

1008
01:48:30,755 --> 01:48:34,357
Quietly now. It's a four-day journey
to the other side.

1009
01:48:34,892 --> 01:48:38,392
Let us hope that our presence
may go unnoticed.

1010
01:49:03,154 --> 01:49:04,515
Pippin.

1011
01:49:25,209 --> 01:49:27,810
I have no memory of this place.

1012
01:49:30,214 --> 01:49:31,313
- Are we lost?
- No.

1013
01:49:31,849 --> 01:49:34,040
- I think we are.
- Gandalf's thinking.

1014
01:49:34,585 --> 01:49:35,752
- Merry?
- What?

1015
01:49:36,254 --> 01:49:37,819
I'm hungry.

1016
01:49:49,500 --> 01:49:53,637
- There's something down there.
- It's Gollum.

1017
01:49:54,172 --> 01:49:57,968
- Gollum?
- He's been following us for three days.

1018
01:49:58,509 --> 01:50:02,339
- He escaped the dungeons of Barad-dûr?
- Escaped...

1019
01:50:03,414 --> 01:50:04,706
...or was set loose.

1020
01:50:11,222 --> 01:50:16,019
He hates and loves the Ring,
as he hates and loves himself.

1021
01:50:16,561 --> 01:50:18,786
He will never be rid of his need for it.

1022
01:50:19,430 --> 01:50:21,963
It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him
when he had the chance.

1023
01:50:22,500 --> 01:50:23,394
Pity?

1024
01:50:24,769 --> 01:50:27,370
It is pity that stayed Bilbo's hand.

1025
01:50:28,606 --> 01:50:33,471
Many that live deserve death.
Some that die deserve life.

1026
01:50:35,279 --> 01:50:37,447
Can you give it to them, Frodo?

1027
01:50:40,151 --> 01:50:43,787
Do not be too eager
to deal out death and judgment.

1028
01:50:44,322 --> 01:50:46,923
Even the very wise
cannot see all ends.

1029
01:50:47,825 --> 01:50:53,395
My heart tells me that Gollum has some
part to play yet, for good or ill...

1030
01:50:54,532 --> 01:50:57,065
...before this is over.

1031
01:50:58,903 --> 01:51:02,437
The pity of Bilbo
may rule the fate of many.

1032
01:51:09,447 --> 01:51:12,412
I wish the Ring
had never come to me.

1033
01:51:14,185 --> 01:51:15,910
I wish none of this had happened.

1034
01:51:16,454 --> 01:51:21,148
So do all who live to see such times.
But that is not for them to decide.

1035
01:51:22,260 --> 01:51:27,421
All we have to decide is what to do
with the time that is given to us.

1036
01:51:29,267 --> 01:51:32,960
There are other forces at work in this
world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.

1037
01:51:33,671 --> 01:51:35,839
Bilbo was meant to find the Ring.

1038
01:51:36,607 --> 01:51:40,607
In which case,
you also were meant to have it.

1039
01:51:41,145 --> 01:51:43,973
And that is an encouraging thought.

1040
01:51:49,186 --> 01:51:50,786
It's that way.

1041
01:51:51,322 --> 01:51:53,252
- He's remembered.
- No.

1042
01:51:53,791 --> 01:51:57,257
But the air doesn't smell
so foul down here.

1043
01:51:57,795 --> 01:52:02,694
If in doubt, Meriadoc,
always follow your nose.

1044
01:52:17,848 --> 01:52:21,678
Let me risk a little more light.

1045
01:52:26,624 --> 01:52:28,383
Behold...

1046
01:52:29,126 --> 01:52:34,059
...the great realm
and Dwarf-city of Dwarrowdelf.

1047
01:52:36,834 --> 01:52:39,935
There's an eye opener, and no mistake.

1048
01:53:05,229 --> 01:53:06,590
Gimli!

1049
01:53:14,338 --> 01:53:15,630
No!

1050
01:53:18,576 --> 01:53:21,404
Oh, no.

1051
01:53:23,547 --> 01:53:24,475
No.

1052
01:53:32,123 --> 01:53:33,791
"Here lies Balin...

1053
01:53:34,558 --> 01:53:36,226
...son of Fundin...

1054
01:53:36,861 --> 01:53:39,155
...Lord of Moria."

1055
01:53:40,564 --> 01:53:41,925
He is dead, then.

1056
01:53:44,001 --> 01:53:45,362
It's as I feared.

1057
01:54:03,954 --> 01:54:06,521
We must move on. We cannot linger.

1058
01:54:07,058 --> 01:54:11,422
"They have taken the bridge
and the second hall.

1059
01:54:12,863 --> 01:54:15,123
We have barred the gates...

1060
01:54:16,133 --> 01:54:18,301
...but cannot hold them for long.

1061
01:54:18,803 --> 01:54:21,267
The ground shakes.

1062
01:54:22,039 --> 01:54:23,263
Drums...

1063
01:54:24,008 --> 01:54:27,041
...drums in the deep.

1064
01:54:30,915 --> 01:54:32,606
We cannot get out.

1065
01:54:34,985 --> 01:54:38,451
A Shadow moves in the dark.

1066
01:54:40,458 --> 01:54:42,718
We cannot get out.

1067
01:54:46,063 --> 01:54:47,628
They are coming."

1068
01:55:31,008 --> 01:55:32,539
Fool of a Took!

1069
01:55:33,244 --> 01:55:36,710
Throw yourself in next time,
and rid us of your stupidity.

1070
01:56:02,940 --> 01:56:04,301
Frodo!

1071
01:56:06,944 --> 01:56:08,043
Orcs.

1072
01:56:15,419 --> 01:56:17,087
Get back! Stay close to Gandalf!

1073
01:56:24,628 --> 01:56:26,125
They have a cave-troll.

1074
01:56:42,279 --> 01:56:43,071
Let them come!

1075
01:56:43,948 --> 01:56:47,140
There is one Dwarf yet in Moria
who still draws breath.

1076
01:58:37,962 --> 01:58:40,392
I think I'm getting the hang of this.

1077
01:58:45,469 --> 01:58:46,864
Frodo!

1078
01:59:20,771 --> 01:59:22,302
Aragorn! Aragorn!

1079
01:59:23,640 --> 01:59:25,171
Frodo!

1080
02:00:10,687 --> 02:00:12,218
Frodo!

1081
02:01:12,783 --> 02:01:13,745
Oh, no.

1082
02:01:22,459 --> 02:01:24,059
He's alive.

1083
02:01:26,830 --> 02:01:29,465
I'm all right. I'm not hurt.

1084
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:31,895
You should be dead.

1085
02:01:32,436 --> 02:01:34,604
That spear would have skewered
a wild boar.

1086
02:01:35,139 --> 02:01:39,538
I think there's more to this Hobbit
than meets the eye.

1087
02:01:45,782 --> 02:01:46,471
Mithril.

1088
02:01:49,620 --> 02:01:51,880
You are full of surprises,
Master Baggins.

1089
02:01:58,262 --> 02:01:59,827
To the Bridge of Khazad-dûm!

1090
02:02:15,145 --> 02:02:16,472
This way!

1091
02:03:27,184 --> 02:03:29,819
What is this new devilry?

1092
02:03:46,236 --> 02:03:48,666
A Balrog.

1093
02:03:49,373 --> 02:03:52,133
A demon of the ancient world.

1094
02:03:54,711 --> 02:03:56,777
This foe is beyond any of you.

1095
02:03:58,282 --> 02:03:59,506
Run!

1096
02:04:07,224 --> 02:04:08,391
Quickly!

1097
02:04:25,309 --> 02:04:26,271
Gandalf.

1098
02:04:27,210 --> 02:04:28,468
Lead them on, Aragorn.

1099
02:04:30,247 --> 02:04:32,415
The bridge is near.

1100
02:04:34,785 --> 02:04:38,581
Do as I say!
Swords are no more use here.

1101
02:05:08,018 --> 02:05:09,447
Gandalf!

1102
02:05:28,038 --> 02:05:28,932
Merry! Pippin!

1103
02:05:40,384 --> 02:05:41,574
Sam!

1104
02:05:44,654 --> 02:05:47,551
Nobody tosses a Dwarf.

1105
02:05:50,927 --> 02:05:52,026
Not the beard!

1106
02:06:05,575 --> 02:06:07,175
Steady.

1107
02:06:09,579 --> 02:06:10,906
Hold on!

1108
02:06:32,302 --> 02:06:33,162
Hang on!

1109
02:06:44,281 --> 02:06:45,710
Lean forward!

1110
02:06:49,052 --> 02:06:49,741
Steady.

1111
02:06:51,388 --> 02:06:52,214
Come on!

1112
02:06:52,756 --> 02:06:53,923
Now!

1113
02:07:11,441 --> 02:07:12,938
Over the bridge!

1114
02:07:13,477 --> 02:07:14,735
Fly!

1115
02:07:59,689 --> 02:08:01,414
You cannot pass!

1116
02:08:01,958 --> 02:08:03,182
Gandalf!

1117
02:08:07,797 --> 02:08:12,332
I am a servant of the Secret Fire,
wielder of the flame of Anor.

1118
02:08:13,670 --> 02:08:17,136
The dark fire will not avail you,
flame of Udûn!

1119
02:08:27,417 --> 02:08:29,051
Go back to the Shadow.

1120
02:08:37,227 --> 02:08:41,364
You shall not pass!

1121
02:09:08,825 --> 02:09:12,393
- No! No!
- Gandalf!

1122
02:09:20,403 --> 02:09:22,503
Fly, you fools!

1123
02:09:26,977 --> 02:09:28,804
No!

1124
02:09:35,285 --> 02:09:37,112
Aragorn!

1125
02:10:34,744 --> 02:10:37,208
Legolas, get them up.

1126
02:10:41,651 --> 02:10:43,182
Give them a moment, for pity's sake!

1127
02:10:43,720 --> 02:10:47,015
By nightfall, these hills will
be swarming with Orcs.

1128
02:10:47,557 --> 02:10:50,556
We must reach the woods of Lothlórien.

1129
02:10:51,828 --> 02:10:54,759
Come, Boromir. Legolas.
Gimli, get them up.

1130
02:10:56,599 --> 02:10:58,494
On your feet, Sam.

1131
02:10:59,169 --> 02:11:00,336
Frodo?

1132
02:11:02,706 --> 02:11:04,067
Frodo!

1133
02:11:56,926 --> 02:11:59,117
Stay close, young Hobbits!

1134
02:12:00,230 --> 02:12:04,026
They say that a great sorceress
lives in these woods.

1135
02:12:04,567 --> 02:12:06,758
An Elf-witch...

1136
02:12:07,637 --> 02:12:10,170
...of terrible power.

1137
02:12:11,074 --> 02:12:12,935
All who look upon her...

1138
02:12:13,476 --> 02:12:14,939
...fall under her spell.

1139
02:12:15,478 --> 02:12:16,440
<i>Frodo!</i>

1140
02:12:19,015 --> 02:12:20,740
And are never seen again.

1141
02:12:21,284 --> 02:12:25,444
<i>Your coming to us is
as the footsteps of doom.</i>

1142
02:12:25,989 --> 02:12:29,386
<i>You bring great evil here,
Ring-bearer.</i>

1143
02:12:29,926 --> 02:12:31,321
Mr. Frodo?

1144
02:12:36,966 --> 02:12:42,229
Well, here's one Dwarf
she won't ensnare so easily.

1145
02:12:42,772 --> 02:12:46,966
I have the eyes of a hawk
and the ears of a fox.

1146
02:12:54,984 --> 02:12:59,246
The Dwarf breathes so loud,
we could have shot him in the dark.

1147
02:13:01,324 --> 02:13:02,491
Haldir of Lorien.

1148
02:13:03,393 --> 02:13:05,061
We come here for help.

1149
02:13:06,930 --> 02:13:08,325
We need your protection.

1150
02:13:08,865 --> 02:13:12,763
Aragorn, these woods are perilous.
We should go back.

1151
02:13:13,303 --> 02:13:18,873
You have entered the realm of the Lady
of the Wood. You cannot go back.

1152
02:13:21,611 --> 02:13:24,769
Come. She is waiting.

1153
02:14:32,181 --> 02:14:36,250
Eight there are here, yet nine there
were set out from Rivendell.

1154
02:14:36,853 --> 02:14:38,316
Tell me, where is Gandalf?

1155
02:14:38,855 --> 02:14:42,423
For I much desire to speak with him.

1156
02:14:44,394 --> 02:14:47,257
He has fallen into Shadow.

1157
02:14:52,435 --> 02:14:55,161
The quest stands upon the edge
of a knife.

1158
02:14:56,339 --> 02:14:59,008
Stray but a little and it will fail...

1159
02:14:59,709 --> 02:15:02,207
...to the ruin of all.

1160
02:15:16,292 --> 02:15:20,554
Yet hope remains
while the Company is true.

1161
02:15:24,200 --> 02:15:28,530
Do not let your hearts be troubled.
Go now and rest...

1162
02:15:29,439 --> 02:15:32,631
...for you are weary with sorrow
and much toil.

1163
02:15:35,445 --> 02:15:37,045
Tonight, you will sleep...

1164
02:15:37,580 --> 02:15:40,613
<i>Welcome, Frodo of the Shire...</i>

1165
02:15:42,251 --> 02:15:43,942
<i>... one who has seen the Eye!</i>

1166
02:15:59,035 --> 02:16:01,135
A lament for Gandalf.

1167
02:16:03,406 --> 02:16:05,404
What do they say about him?

1168
02:16:05,942 --> 02:16:10,739
I have not the heart to tell you.
For me, the grief is still too near.

1169
02:16:13,783 --> 02:16:15,713
Take some rest.

1170
02:16:16,519 --> 02:16:18,847
These borders are well-protected.

1171
02:16:19,389 --> 02:16:21,614
I will find no rest here.

1172
02:16:24,761 --> 02:16:27,430
I heard her voice inside my head.

1173
02:16:28,031 --> 02:16:31,394
She spoke of my father
and the fall of Gondor.

1174
02:16:31,934 --> 02:16:37,072
She said to me,
"Even now there is hope left."

1175
02:16:38,808 --> 02:16:41,306
But I cannot see it.

1176
02:16:42,945 --> 02:16:45,113
It is long since we had any hope.

1177
02:16:55,691 --> 02:16:57,484
My father is a noble man.

1178
02:16:58,561 --> 02:17:00,422
But his rule is failing...

1179
02:17:03,900 --> 02:17:06,194
...and our people lose faith.

1180
02:17:08,171 --> 02:17:11,136
He looks to me to make things right,
and I would do it.

1181
02:17:11,674 --> 02:17:14,866
I would see the glory
of Gondor restored.

1182
02:17:18,281 --> 02:17:20,711
Have you ever seen it, Aragorn?

1183
02:17:21,684 --> 02:17:23,545
The White Tower of Ecthelion.

1184
02:17:24,087 --> 02:17:27,382
Glimmering like a spike
of pearl and silver.

1185
02:17:28,391 --> 02:17:31,549
Its banners caught high
in the morning breeze.

1186
02:17:34,764 --> 02:17:36,659
Have you ever been called home...

1187
02:17:37,200 --> 02:17:40,529
...by the clear ringing
of silver trumpets?

1188
02:17:41,771 --> 02:17:44,406
I have seen the White City...

1189
02:17:45,208 --> 02:17:46,239
...long ago.

1190
02:17:47,543 --> 02:17:52,146
One day, our paths will lead us there.

1191
02:17:53,449 --> 02:17:56,050
And the tower guard
shall take up the call:

1192
02:17:56,819 --> 02:17:59,818
"The Lords of Gondor have returned."

1193
02:19:07,179 --> 02:19:09,404
Will you look into the mirror?

1194
02:19:09,949 --> 02:19:11,139
What will I see?

1195
02:19:14,453 --> 02:19:16,451
Even the wisest cannot tell.

1196
02:19:17,690 --> 02:19:19,187
For the mirror...

1197
02:19:19,725 --> 02:19:21,916
...shows many things.

1198
02:19:25,264 --> 02:19:27,330
Things that were...

1199
02:19:27,867 --> 02:19:30,092
...things that are...

1200
02:19:31,203 --> 02:19:32,837
...and some things...

1201
02:19:36,742 --> 02:19:39,741
...that have not yet come to pass.

1202
02:21:02,628 --> 02:21:05,126
I know what it is you saw.

1203
02:21:07,900 --> 02:21:10,068
For it is also in my mind.

1204
02:21:12,171 --> 02:21:15,898
<i>It is what will come to pass
if you should fail.</i>

1205
02:21:18,611 --> 02:21:23,146
<i>The Fellowship is breaking.
It is already begun.</i>

1206
02:21:24,116 --> 02:21:27,081
<i>He will try to take the Ring.</i>

1207
02:21:27,620 --> 02:21:29,288
<i>You know of whom I speak.</i>

1208
02:21:30,623 --> 02:21:34,953
<i>One by one, it will destroy them all.</i>

1209
02:21:36,795 --> 02:21:38,895
<i>If you ask it of me...</i>

1210
02:21:39,632 --> 02:21:42,358
<i>... I will give you the One Ring.</i>

1211
02:21:43,736 --> 02:21:45,563
You offer it to me freely.

1212
02:21:50,509 --> 02:21:54,111
I do not deny that my heart
has greatly desired this.

1213
02:22:00,819 --> 02:22:03,750
In place of a Dark Lord,
you would have a queen...

1214
02:22:04,557 --> 02:22:08,023
...not dark but beautiful,
and terrible as the dawn!

1215
02:22:08,994 --> 02:22:11,686
Treacherous as the sea!

1216
02:22:12,531 --> 02:22:17,100
Stronger than the foundations
of the earth!

1217
02:22:17,903 --> 02:22:19,969
All shall love me...

1218
02:22:20,506 --> 02:22:23,004
...and despair.

1219
02:22:37,423 --> 02:22:41,423
I pass the test. I will diminish...

1220
02:22:42,027 --> 02:22:44,195
...and go into the West...

1221
02:22:44,697 --> 02:22:48,834
...and remain Galadriel.
- I cannot do this alone.

1222
02:22:52,771 --> 02:22:56,567
You are a Ring-bearer, Frodo.
To bear a Ring of Power...

1223
02:22:57,843 --> 02:22:59,010
...is to be alone.

1224
02:22:59,945 --> 02:23:03,046
This task was appointed to you.

1225
02:23:03,882 --> 02:23:06,745
And if you do not find a way...

1226
02:23:07,953 --> 02:23:09,621
...no one will.

1227
02:23:10,356 --> 02:23:13,150
Then I know what I must do.

1228
02:23:14,193 --> 02:23:14,917
It's just...

1229
02:23:18,497 --> 02:23:20,427
...I'm afraid to do it.

1230
02:23:24,236 --> 02:23:29,033
Even the smallest person can change
the course of the future.

1231
02:23:34,713 --> 02:23:40,113
Do you know how the Orcs
first came into being?

1232
02:23:41,186 --> 02:23:44,219
They were Elves once.

1233
02:23:45,758 --> 02:23:48,757
Taken by the Dark Powers...

1234
02:23:49,295 --> 02:23:52,123
...tortured and mutilated.

1235
02:23:52,798 --> 02:23:57,765
A ruined and terrible form of life.

1236
02:23:58,404 --> 02:23:59,867
And now...

1237
02:24:01,674 --> 02:24:03,239
...perfected.

1238
02:24:04,276 --> 02:24:07,104
My fighting Uruk-hai...

1239
02:24:09,381 --> 02:24:11,379
...whom do you serve?

1240
02:24:11,917 --> 02:24:14,085
Saruman!

1241
02:24:35,240 --> 02:24:38,341
Hunt them down. Do not stop
until they are found.

1242
02:24:38,877 --> 02:24:41,478
You do not know pain.
You do not know fear.

1243
02:24:42,014 --> 02:24:44,649
You will taste Man-flesh!

1244
02:24:50,022 --> 02:24:53,385
One of the halflings carries
something of great value.

1245
02:24:53,892 --> 02:24:57,756
Bring them to me alive and unspoiled.

1246
02:24:59,898 --> 02:25:00,860
Kill the others.

1247
02:25:29,094 --> 02:25:31,957
<i>Farewell, Frodo Baggins.</i>

1248
02:25:32,498 --> 02:25:35,565
I give you the light of Eärendil...

1249
02:25:36,668 --> 02:25:38,666
...our most beloved star.

1250
02:25:50,716 --> 02:25:54,785
<i>May it be a light for you
in dark places...</i>

1251
02:25:55,320 --> 02:25:59,116
<i>... when all other lights go out.</i>

1252
02:27:38,457 --> 02:27:39,454
Frodo.

1253
02:27:41,660 --> 02:27:42,827
The Argonath.

1254
02:27:46,598 --> 02:27:49,995
Long have I desired
to look upon the kings of old.

1255
02:27:51,069 --> 02:27:52,669
My kin.

1256
02:29:11,984 --> 02:29:13,879
We cross the lake at nightfall.

1257
02:29:14,419 --> 02:29:16,644
Hide the boats and continue on foot.

1258
02:29:17,189 --> 02:29:20,325
- We approach Mordor from the North.
- Oh, yes?

1259
02:29:21,026 --> 02:29:24,526
Just a simple matter of finding
our way through Emyn Muil...

1260
02:29:25,063 --> 02:29:27,960
...an impassable labyrinth
of razor-sharp rocks.

1261
02:29:28,500 --> 02:29:31,260
And after that, it gets even better.

1262
02:29:32,004 --> 02:29:36,607
Festering, stinking marshland
as far as the eye can see.

1263
02:29:37,142 --> 02:29:38,207
That is our road.

1264
02:29:40,078 --> 02:29:42,941
I suggest you take some rest
and recover your strength, Master Dwarf.

1265
02:29:43,482 --> 02:29:44,877
Recover my...

1266
02:29:48,253 --> 02:29:49,853
- We should leave now.
- No.

1267
02:29:50,389 --> 02:29:54,492
Orcs patrol the eastern shore.
We must wait for cover of darkness.

1268
02:29:55,027 --> 02:29:58,163
It is not the eastern shore
that worries me.

1269
02:29:58,697 --> 02:30:02,356
A shadow and a threat
has been growing in my mind.

1270
02:30:03,201 --> 02:30:07,099
Something draws near.
I can feel it.

1271
02:30:09,374 --> 02:30:14,011
Recover strength?
Pay no heed to that, young Hobbit.

1272
02:30:14,846 --> 02:30:16,207
Where's Frodo?

1273
02:30:42,207 --> 02:30:43,807
None of us should wander alone.

1274
02:30:45,510 --> 02:30:47,303
You, least of all.

1275
02:30:47,846 --> 02:30:49,946
So much depends on you.

1276
02:30:51,349 --> 02:30:52,949
Frodo?

1277
02:31:00,392 --> 02:31:02,617
I know why you seek solitude.

1278
02:31:03,695 --> 02:31:06,762
You suffer. I see it day by day.

1279
02:31:07,899 --> 02:31:10,625
You sure you do not suffer needlessly?

1280
02:31:12,537 --> 02:31:14,865
There are other ways, Frodo.

1281
02:31:15,407 --> 02:31:18,907
- Other paths that we might take.
- I know what you would say.

1282
02:31:19,444 --> 02:31:22,910
It would seem like wisdom
but for the warning in my heart.

1283
02:31:23,448 --> 02:31:26,208
Warning? Against what?

1284
02:31:26,752 --> 02:31:28,545
We're all afraid, Frodo.

1285
02:31:29,087 --> 02:31:32,382
But to let that fear drive us,
to destroy what hope we have...

1286
02:31:32,924 --> 02:31:36,390
...don't you see that is madness?
- There is no other way.

1287
02:31:38,463 --> 02:31:41,496
I ask only for the strength
to defend my people!

1288
02:31:43,401 --> 02:31:45,092
- If you would but lend me the Ring.
- No.

1289
02:31:46,671 --> 02:31:50,034
- Why do you recoil? I am no thief.
- You are not yourself.

1290
02:31:52,144 --> 02:31:55,143
What chance do you think you have?

1291
02:31:55,714 --> 02:32:00,044
They will find you.
They will take the Ring.

1292
02:32:00,585 --> 02:32:03,948
And you will beg for death
before the end!

1293
02:32:06,424 --> 02:32:08,149
You fool!

1294
02:32:08,693 --> 02:32:12,352
It is not yours, save by unhappy chance!
It could have been mine.

1295
02:32:12,898 --> 02:32:15,362
It should be mine! Give it to me!

1296
02:32:15,901 --> 02:32:16,829
- Give it to me!
- No!

1297
02:32:17,369 --> 02:32:18,866
- Give it to me!
- No.

1298
02:32:26,845 --> 02:32:28,570
I see your mind.

1299
02:32:29,114 --> 02:32:31,749
You will take the Ring to Sauron!

1300
02:32:32,284 --> 02:32:33,815
You will betray us!

1301
02:32:34,352 --> 02:32:37,215
You'll go to your death,
and the death of us all!

1302
02:32:37,989 --> 02:32:41,318
Curse you!
Curse you and all the halflings!

1303
02:32:48,700 --> 02:32:49,890
Frodo?

1304
02:32:54,539 --> 02:32:55,797
Frodo.

1305
02:33:00,045 --> 02:33:01,770
What have I done?

1306
02:33:02,314 --> 02:33:03,675
Please, Frodo.

1307
02:33:04,216 --> 02:33:06,544
Frodo, I'm sorry!

1308
02:33:55,467 --> 02:33:56,566
Frodo?

1309
02:33:58,169 --> 02:34:00,895
- It has taken Boromir.
- Where is the Ring?

1310
02:34:01,439 --> 02:34:02,902
Stay away!

1311
02:34:03,675 --> 02:34:04,899
Frodo!

1312
02:34:07,512 --> 02:34:10,978
- I swore to protect you.
- Can you protect me from yourself?

1313
02:34:21,026 --> 02:34:23,194
Would you destroy it?

1314
02:34:28,466 --> 02:34:30,100
<i>Aragorn.</i>

1315
02:34:33,838 --> 02:34:35,836
<i>Aragorn.</i>

1316
02:34:37,976 --> 02:34:39,507
<i>Elessar.</i>

1317
02:34:47,485 --> 02:34:50,518
I would have gone with you to the end.

1318
02:34:51,556 --> 02:34:54,054
Into the very fires of Mordor.

1319
02:34:57,696 --> 02:34:58,556
I know.

1320
02:35:01,333 --> 02:35:06,471
Look after the others. Especially Sam.
He will not understand.

1321
02:35:10,575 --> 02:35:11,936
Go, Frodo!

1322
02:35:15,280 --> 02:35:16,447
Run.

1323
02:35:17,015 --> 02:35:18,342
Run!

1324
02:35:43,241 --> 02:35:44,602
Mr. Frodo!

1325
02:35:54,185 --> 02:35:55,648
Find the halfling!

1326
02:35:57,589 --> 02:35:59,814
Find the halfling!

1327
02:36:03,595 --> 02:36:04,956
Elendil!

1328
02:36:11,803 --> 02:36:12,993
Aragorn, go!

1329
02:36:35,060 --> 02:36:36,022
Frodo!

1330
02:36:36,928 --> 02:36:38,220
Hide here. Quick!

1331
02:36:39,197 --> 02:36:40,296
Come on!

1332
02:36:43,101 --> 02:36:44,826
What's he doing?

1333
02:36:49,374 --> 02:36:51,042
He's leaving.

1334
02:36:56,147 --> 02:36:58,748
- No!
- Pippin!

1335
02:37:04,022 --> 02:37:05,986
Run, Frodo. Go on!

1336
02:37:06,891 --> 02:37:09,651
- Hey! Hey, you!
- Over here!

1337
02:37:10,395 --> 02:37:11,653
- Over here!
- This way!

1338
02:37:22,874 --> 02:37:24,838
- It's working!
- I know it's working! Run!

1339
02:38:14,592 --> 02:38:17,318
- The horn of Gondor.
- Boromir.

1340
02:38:42,487 --> 02:38:43,279
Run!

1341
02:42:02,820 --> 02:42:04,078
No.

1342
02:42:08,192 --> 02:42:10,884
- They took the little ones.
- Hold still.

1343
02:42:11,496 --> 02:42:13,187
Frodo. Where is Frodo?

1344
02:42:15,400 --> 02:42:16,567
I let Frodo go.

1345
02:42:17,535 --> 02:42:19,829
Then you did what I could not.

1346
02:42:21,139 --> 02:42:24,104
I tried to take the Ring from him.

1347
02:42:25,009 --> 02:42:28,907
- The Ring is beyond our reach now.
- Forgive me.

1348
02:42:29,447 --> 02:42:31,411
I did not see it.

1349
02:42:31,949 --> 02:42:34,812
- I have failed you all.
- No, Boromir.

1350
02:42:35,920 --> 02:42:37,781
You fought bravely.

1351
02:42:38,656 --> 02:42:40,756
You have kept your honor.

1352
02:42:41,726 --> 02:42:43,257
Leave it.

1353
02:42:44,061 --> 02:42:45,695
It is over.

1354
02:42:47,231 --> 02:42:52,096
The world of Men will fall.
And all will come to darkness...

1355
02:42:52,904 --> 02:42:55,573
...and my city to ruin.

1356
02:43:00,144 --> 02:43:02,677
I do not know what strength
is in my blood...

1357
02:43:03,214 --> 02:43:06,543
...but I swear to you,
I will not let the White City fall...

1358
02:43:07,852 --> 02:43:10,043
...nor our people fail.

1359
02:43:11,322 --> 02:43:12,387
Our people.

1360
02:43:16,561 --> 02:43:18,286
Our people.

1361
02:43:40,384 --> 02:43:43,076
I would have followed you, my brother.

1362
02:43:44,956 --> 02:43:46,624
My captain.

1363
02:43:49,560 --> 02:43:51,160
My king.

1364
02:44:11,148 --> 02:44:13,043
Be at peace...

1365
02:44:13,784 --> 02:44:15,418
...son of Gondor.

1366
02:44:54,892 --> 02:44:56,321
Frodo!

1367
02:45:16,213 --> 02:45:19,144
<i>I wish the Ring had never come to me.</i>

1368
02:45:20,751 --> 02:45:23,420
<i>I wish none of this had happened.</i>

1369
02:45:26,724 --> 02:45:29,154
<i>So do all who live
to see such times...</i>

1370
02:45:29,694 --> 02:45:32,830
<i>... but that is not for them to decide.</i>

1371
02:45:33,364 --> 02:45:35,624
<i>All you have to decide...</i>

1372
02:45:36,167 --> 02:45:40,600
...is what to do with the time
that is given to you.

1373
02:46:09,767 --> 02:46:11,492
Frodo, no!

1374
02:46:12,303 --> 02:46:13,265
Frodo!

1375
02:46:14,372 --> 02:46:16,700
- Mr. Frodo!
- No, Sam.

1376
02:46:20,611 --> 02:46:22,245
Go back, Sam!

1377
02:46:23,080 --> 02:46:26,307
- I'm going to Mordor alone.
- Of course you are.

1378
02:46:26,851 --> 02:46:29,349
And I'm coming with you!

1379
02:46:30,154 --> 02:46:32,220
You can't swim!

1380
02:46:36,360 --> 02:46:37,721
Sam!

1381
02:46:43,668 --> 02:46:44,665
Sam!

1382
02:47:25,910 --> 02:47:28,306
I made a promise, Mr. Frodo.

1383
02:47:28,979 --> 02:47:32,979
A promise:
"Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."

1384
02:47:34,418 --> 02:47:36,712
And I don't mean to.

1385
02:47:37,288 --> 02:47:39,149
I don't mean to.

1386
02:47:41,158 --> 02:47:42,621
Sam.

1387
02:47:57,875 --> 02:47:59,202
Come on.

1388
02:48:28,239 --> 02:48:32,205
Hurry! Frodo and Sam
have reached the eastern shore.

1389
02:48:47,625 --> 02:48:52,092
- You mean not to follow them.
- Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.

1390
02:48:55,833 --> 02:49:00,368
Then it has all been in vain.
The Fellowship has failed.

1391
02:49:12,583 --> 02:49:15,411
Not if we hold true to each other.

1392
02:49:17,288 --> 02:49:21,254
We will not abandon Merry and Pippin
to torment and death.

1393
02:49:22,560 --> 02:49:27,493
Not while we have strength left.
Leave all that can be spared behind.

1394
02:49:29,333 --> 02:49:31,001
We travel light.

1395
02:49:31,535 --> 02:49:32,896
Let us hunt some Orc.

1396
02:49:36,473 --> 02:49:37,902
Yes!

1397
02:49:57,461 --> 02:49:58,355
Mordor.

1398
02:49:59,330 --> 02:50:02,363
I hope the others find a safer road.

1399
02:50:03,634 --> 02:50:05,859
Strider will look after them.

1400
02:50:07,137 --> 02:50:10,170
I don't suppose
we'll ever see them again.

1401
02:50:10,841 --> 02:50:12,907
We may yet, Mr. Frodo.

1402
02:50:13,444 --> 02:50:14,702
We may.

1403
02:50:17,081 --> 02:50:17,839
Sam...

1404
02:50:21,752 --> 02:50:24,046
...I'm glad you are with me.

1405
