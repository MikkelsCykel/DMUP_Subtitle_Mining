Hit it again, Smokey.
Cough it up your nose.

This is a done one on this one.
Yeah, buddy.

I thought that nigger was in jail.

I helped write
this motherfucker too.

16
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:15,332
They all did.

25

<i>I got high for the first time.</i>

All right.

00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:04,579
Be out in about 35, 45 minutes.

00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,846
You'll go blind, boy.

Hurry up. This is Friday.
We got to hit the highway.

00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,783
- Punk, you're walkin'!
- But I'm tired.

49
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:07,879
Craig! Will you come on!

50
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:09,881
I don't want to hit that traffic.

51
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:12,577
You had enough time
to get yourself together.

52
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:14,586
I don't believe this.

53
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:17,748
I told that boy to put that hose away
and cut that grass.

54
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:20,918
Look at that grass.
Stanley's grass look good.

55
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:24,987
Mrs. Johnson's grass look good.
But look at my grass. No!

56
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:27,658
When that boy get out of my house...

57
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:29,565
I'm gonna change my number.

58
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:31,729
Craig! Craig!

59
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:33,795
Come on out of that house!

60
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:35,431
Oh, damn!

61
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:39,871
Goodness gracious.

62
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,846
What's goin' on?

63
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,683
Man.

64
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:53,454
Use that brick
to break that chain.

65
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:56,962
You think it's the same brick
Craig knocked your ass out with?

66
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:00,158
Get out of here, you stupid mutt!

67
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:12,342
- Here I come.
- Will you bring your ass!

68
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:17,980
Come on! You got me trying
to break a chain with a brick?

69
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:21,646
Let's go get some pussy, Debo.
Fuck! Shit, man.

70
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:26,317
Shut up! I got some unfinished business
to deal with, and your butt gonna wait.

71
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:28,417
What's the matter?

72
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:31,258
I fell in some mud,
and it's all your fault.

73
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,322
- How is it my fault?
- You're taking all day.

74
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,924
And I told you to put that hose away
and cut that grass.

75
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:39,096
I didn't drop you on your head
when you were a kid.

76
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:42,835
Maybe your grandmother did.
I remember the summer of'75...

77
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:45,434
<i>I didn't want to leave</i>
<i>my neighborhood at all...</i>

78
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,775
<i>especially my homeboy Smokey.</i>

79
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,281
<i>But he went to rehab last month.</i>

80
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,615
<i>And the way he smoke,</i>
<i>ain't no tellin' when he gettin' out.</i>

81
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,119
<i>Gonna sure miss him.</i>

82
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,019
I hate you, man.

83
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:00,116
Here come that dog truck.
Shut your mouth.

84
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,855
We're about to fade to black.

85
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,197
Stop!

86
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,862
Get your ass out the car, Craig!
This is the rematch!

87
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:17,535
Think you can beat on my big brother
and get away with it?

88
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:21,239
- Punch it!
- I got your butt now!

89
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:23,948
Debo! Help!

90
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:28,981
Fake-ass Suge Knight!

91
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:34,491
I'm gonna find you
and put my foot up your ass!

92
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,926
- Get up!
- Damn.

93
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:40,659
I ain't kickin' with you no more.
I'm going to Mommy house.

94
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:45,095
Did you see that? Them niggers
are like some wild dogs.

95
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:49,733
That's why moving with your Uncle Elroy
and your cousin Day-Day is best.

96
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:52,744
Your sister moved out.
It's time for you to move out too.

97
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:56,407
It's time for your mother and I to walk
around the house naked if we want to.

98
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:59,007
What? Y'all are trying
to walk around the house naked?

99
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,212
Yes, we are.

100
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:03,778
We're going to do it tonight
when I get off of work.

101
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:05,949
I can't wait to see
your mama naked.

102
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:08,016
That big old booty bouncin' around.

103
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:12,197
High-heeled shoes on,
walking on that shag rug...

104
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,199
givin' me a lap dance, boy.

105
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,735
- And my johnson swingin'...
- Daddy!

106
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:20,466
Ball goin' one way, johnson the other.
The ball/johnson dance.

107
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,373
Daddy!
I don't wanna hear that.

108
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,875
What's that smell?

109
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:32,079
It must be your upper lip.
I don't smell nothin'.

110
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:33,641
I do!

111
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:35,653
What it smell like?

112
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:37,882
Like you didn't fall in mud.

113
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:42,190
Use this spray.
That's what I got this for.

114
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:45,729
Too much!
What's wrong with this window?

115
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:48,198
That window don't come down.
Remind me to get it fixed.

116
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:49,700
Damn!

117
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,052
Nice neighborhood, huh?

118
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:18,221
It's all right.

119
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:20,231
Fake-ass Brady Bunch.

120
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:21,891
Eighteen years, son...

121
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:25,028
I been chasin' nasty,
stinkin', dirty, filthy dogs.

122
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:27,834
I been bitten by every dog
there is in the world...

123
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:31,240
pit bull, boxers,
collies, Seein'-Eye dogs.

124
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,743
What about a Chihuahua?

125
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:34,575
Twice!

126
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:37,844
Then there's my brother Elroy.

127
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:40,249
Everybody loves Elroy...

128
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:42,310
a lazy nothin'!

129
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:45,289
Hit the Lotto.
I just can't understand it.

130
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:51,727
- All right. You comin' in?
- Hell no, I ain't goin' in there.

131
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:54,698
I don't want to see Elroy's face
or smell his stinkin' breath.

132
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:57,133
It's going to be different
livin' out here.

133
00:08:57,203 --> 00:09:00,434
Don't let your uncle or your cousin
get you into any kind of shit.

134
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:03,737
I'm grown now.
Can't nobody get me in trouble.

135
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:05,572
I'm glad you said that.

136
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:08,239
Since you're grown,
don't bring your ass back home.

137
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,052
Daddy, Craig's here!

138
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:26,590
- Uncle Willie.
- How you doin', Day-Day?

139
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:30,067
- Where's your big-head father?
- There he is right there.

140
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,235
Hey, Unc!

141
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,175
I heard you're running
from an ass-whippin'.

142
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:40,076
It ain't even like that.
Talk to your brother.

143
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:42,740
If it had been me,
I'd have shot him.

144
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:45,079
I know he'd have popped him.

145
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,186
Hey, Willie! How's it goin'?

146
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,191
Still steppin' in that dog shit
every day?

147
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:56,791
You take care of my boy.

148
00:09:56,862 --> 00:09:58,796
Don't worry about nothin',
big bro.

149
00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:01,424
He's in the best hands
in Rancho "Choke-among-us."

150
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,936
I'm the king here. You just
another nigger late payin' his rent.

151
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:06,369
Ain't that right, nephew?

152
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,407
- Yeah.
- Wait, Craig.

153
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:10,874
- Remember what I told you.
- I'll remember.

154
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,844
Now, Lotto stud...

155
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:15,847
close my door, don't slam it.

156
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:21,053
Can't even count to ten, and suddenly
you hit the Lotto. Ain't that a bitch?

157
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,215
Send Betty my love!

158
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,782
- Boy, you lookin' good.
- I can't call it.

159
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:32,559
Give me that bag.
When you're finished with him, come in.

160
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,293
All right. Thanks, Unc.

161
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:37,935
Damn.

162
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:41,531
It's been what, a year, since we
kicked it at the family reunion?

163
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:43,370
It was about a year, huh?

164
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:45,137
Yeah, man.

165
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:47,702
Ever since you moved out here,
we lost touch.

166
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:51,045
I know.
This is a long way from Watts.

167
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:53,608
But the good thing
about bein' out here...

168
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:56,348
we don't hear no gunshots,
no helicopters.

169
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:59,949
No police, no crackheads,
no chicken heads, no nothin'.

170
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:02,187
Just clean, fresh air.
Just smell.

171
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:04,320
Smell good, huh?

172
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:06,331
Taste good.
Taste the air.

173
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:09,267
- Yeah, dude.
- Aw, man.

174
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,326
Aw, shit!

175
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:17,036
Who is that?

176
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,044
The Joker brothers.

177
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:27,617
That's Joker.
He just got out of the pen.

178
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,622
There's Little Joker.
He just got out of Y.A.

179
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:34,387
Then there's Baby Joker right there.
He just got out the juvenile center.

180
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,224
Then they got
a little dog named Cheeco.

181
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:39,730
You better watch him.
He'll bite the shit out of you.

182
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:42,863
But I got something better
than that Cadillac.

183
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:44,698
- What's that?
- Peep this.

184
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,897
What?

185
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:48,564
Check this out.

186
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,807
- This you?
- A little something I picked up.

187
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,904
- You diggin' that?
- Damn.

188
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:59,382
I wish we hit the Lotto and came up
on a million dollars like y'all.

189
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:03,047
After payin' taxes and lawyer fees
and all Daddy's bad-ass credit...

190
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:06,091
buyin' Viagra, trickin' with
these sack chasers around here...

191
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:09,389
$30, $40 now and then,
I ain't end up with a million dollars.

192
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:13,558
We end up with this crib and
this bad motherfucker right here.

193
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:15,224
It's off the hook.

194
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:16,893
- You like that, huh?
- I do.

195
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:18,960
I just got them 20's there.

196
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:21,506
Them ain't 20's,
but it's off the hook.

197
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,668
Them are 20's. No, they're tens.
I bought 'em from somebody.

198
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,008
- But they nice, though.
- Yeah, they cool.

199
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,512
They tight.

200
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,448
Then since I had this,
my pussy rate went...

201
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:35,578
I get more pussy from police ladies.
Everybody give me some pussy.

202
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:37,679
What up, Day-Day?

203
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,123
Oh, this lady is funny, man.

204
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:42,456
She used to own a record booth
at the Slauson swap meet.

205
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:45,292
She is funny as hell.
Come on.

206
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:46,763
What up, Mulan?

207
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:50,495
Hey, wait! Don't be steppin'
on those flowers, motherfucker.

208
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:52,537
I just planted that shit.

209
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:57,308
- Who's your boy?
- That's my cousin Craig from L.A.

210
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:59,537
Craig, meet Miss Ho.

211
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,204
Ho-Kym, motherfucker.

212
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,840
Day-Day's just trying
to be a smart-ass.

213
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,850
Nice to meet you, Craig.

214
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:15,216
Yo, Day-Day, something's going down
with those <i>eses</i> across the street.

215
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:18,161
Yeah, I've been seein'
a lot of activity.

216
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,494
What kind of activity?

217
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:24,297
Strange activity. I think
they're running drugs from Tijuana.

218
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,565
- Day-Day don't believe me.
- I ain't got time.

219
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,335
Got to go, Miss Ho.
I'm just kiddin'.

220
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:33,174
Come by after work.
I got the John Blaze shit for you.

221
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,713
Nice to meet you.

222
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:37,715
- Peace out, Craig.
- Peace out.

223
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:41,813
Yeah. Bye. See ya.

224
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:43,718
Man.

225
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:46,189
Nice hat.

226
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:49,953
I told you she was funny.

227
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:54,359
- Big house, ain't it?
- Yeah, it is.

228
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:59,029
Yeah. Y'all wish y'all had
one like this, didn't ya?

229
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:00,628
We do.

230
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:03,869
Daddy! Where my shirt at?

231
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:06,537
- Daddy, where my shirt?
- Which one? The pink one?

232
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:10,207
You have it here.
Ran out of toilet paper, son. Sorry.

233
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:12,375
- Sure was soft, though.
- You wiped your ass with my shirt?

234
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:16,410
Told you not to leave your shit
in the bathroom.

235
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:18,080
What you doin'?

236
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:20,250
This is a nice house, man.

237
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:21,918
I know. Thanks.

238
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:24,963
I just wish
Mama had a chance to see it.

239
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:28,397
You know she had a heart attack and died
when she found out we won the lottery.

240
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:30,059
I know the story.

241
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:33,901
If Mama had a chance to see this,
she'd have been so happy.

242
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:35,873
But that's how things work.

243
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:38,409
Well, I'm about to go to work...

244
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:41,037
something you might not never
know nothin' about.

245
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:44,139
- Know what I'm sayin'?
- Where you workin' at?

246
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,047
At Pinky's Record and Disc.

247
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:48,712
You can't live in this house
without a job.

248
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:53,281
So try to think about that,
'cause I got me a job.

249
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:55,793
Job, job, job.

250
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:11,642
Damn.

251
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:28,425
Suga!

252
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:31,420
I'm comin'!

253
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:37,262
Craig, I want you to meet
my old lady Suga.

254
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:40,169
Suga, my nephew Craig.

255
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:46,444
You even cuter
than your baby pictures.

256
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:48,173
Thank you.

257
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:53,681
We can keep it all in the family.

258
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:56,988
You got a fat ass.

259
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:59,786
All right, that's enough!

260
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:01,621
Shit! That's enough!

261
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:04,663
Go back upstairs,
and put on some damn clothes!

262
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:07,290
- Go now!
- Help me out.

263
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,231
Nice meetin' you, Craig.

264
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,803
Nice to meet you.

265
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,835
That woman gonna be
the death of me one day.

266
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:22,847
Viagra ain't workin'.
My back keep goin' out.

267
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:25,907
That freak can't get enough
from your Uncle Elroy.

268
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:30,081
But check this out. Got to lay
some ground rules down on you.

269
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:33,249
- You family. I love you.
- I love you, too, Unc.

270
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,691
You welcome to anything
in my house...

271
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:38,195
but don't let me catch you
in my refrigerator...

272
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:40,424
or with your finger
in my sugar bowl.

273
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,524
- You feel me knockin'?
- I feel you.

274
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:44,592
Well, let me in.

275
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,501
Who is that with Day-Day's car?

276
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:48,597
That D'wana.

277
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,198
Boy's ex.

278
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:51,936
Hey, Day-Day!

279
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,036
That crazy bitch out there again!

280
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:57,048
- What's she doin' with that key?
- Damn.

281
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:59,380
- Aw, shit!
- Is she writin' on it?

282
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:02,113
- Scratchin' the shit out of it.
- Goddamn!

283
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:08,059
What y'all just standin' there lookin'?
Do something!

284
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:09,754
Huggin', just standin' there.

285
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:16,095
You're supposed to be
1,000 feet away from my house!

286
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:19,729
Nigger, you can't quit me.
I'm pregnant with your baby.

287
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:22,137
That ain't my baby.

288
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,141
That's my baby right there.

289
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,699
Aw, man!

290
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:29,111
You keyed my...
Bitch, you keyed my...

291
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:31,775
I got your bitch right here.

292
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,044
Yeah, nigger.

293
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:35,313
Daddy, she sprayed me!

294
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,981
Shut up, you punk!
Don't nobody quit me.

295
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,423
Wait till I tell Baby D.
She gonna fuck you up!

296
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:44,485
- She sprayed the player!
- Better watch your back!

297
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:48,761
Be still. Boy, look like you got
a fatal attraction on your hands.

298
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:51,428
I had two or three of 'em
in my day.

299
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:57,065
Craig, I hope you can handle your women
better than this fool can.

300
00:17:57,142 --> 00:18:00,976
- That's too much water.
- Nah, it ain't. Take 20 minutes.

301
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:04,243
I've been pepper-sprayed nine times.
Take 20 minutes.

302
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:08,047
You got 19 to go.
Let me show you the backyard.

303
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,146
It's bigger than y'all's backyard.

304
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:14,317
Call the police and tell them
to get me another restraining order.

305
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:18,227
Yeah, you gotta have a little money
to live out here.

306
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:19,730
Oh, yeah?

307
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:21,732
I know what you're thinkin'.

308
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:25,236
I was the one back in the day always
talkin' about how I love the hood...

309
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:26,737
I love the ghetto.

310
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:29,899
I was the one sayin' I wasn't the kind
of nigger to run to the suburbs.

311
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:32,170
You're right, that's what I said.

312
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:35,805
But soon as I got my check,
I was gone!

313
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:39,647
Paid $230,000 cash on this place.

314
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:42,585
- You paid cash for this?
- Cash money!

315
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:45,248
Don't try to stick me
with some 30-year payment plan.

316
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:46,757
That's for suckers.

317
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:50,317
Got my daddy like that
years ago on a Cadillac.

318
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:53,660
I got the only house
on the block paid for.

319
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:56,496
That's why I'm the king around here!

320
00:18:57,569 --> 00:18:59,264
You're the king, Unc.

321
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:01,363
How you like that pool?

322
00:19:05,944 --> 00:19:09,311
- Big, ain't it?
- Yeah, it's cool.

323
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:11,815
But where the water at?

324
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:13,715
Don't need no water.

325
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:16,379
Ain't no pools in the projects.

326
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:19,049
None of us swim.

327
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:21,285
- So y'all never use it?
- Never.

328
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,885
But the Jacuzzi,
that's something else.

329
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:28,228
Me and my Suga
get real nasty in there.

330
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:33,801
Guess I left that in there.

331
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:38,405
You welcome to use it
anytime you want.

332
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:41,969
Shit, you my brother's boy!

333
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:45,539
That's all right, Unc.
I can't swim neither.

334
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:48,051
No? Good.

335
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,486
I won't have to clean up
behind you then.

336
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:52,990
Come on.
Let me show you something else.

337
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:03,892
Man, you straight?

338
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:08,369
No, I ain't straight.
My eyes still red?

339
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,873
A little bit.

340
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:12,968
- A little bit?
- She fucked you up.

341
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,639
Can't taste nothin'.
My tongue is numb.

342
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:19,013
Why'd y'all let her do this shit?

343
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:21,177
It's your girl.

344
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:24,916
What's up with her, man?
She mean as hell.

345
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:27,925
I met D'wana
about three months ago.

346
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:31,656
She had a pudge on her stomach,
but I ain't pay no attention to it.

347
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:35,427
I thought it came from drinkin' 40's
'cause she had beer on her breath.

348
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,833
Turns out she's six months pregnant.
Told me I'm the baby's daddy.

349
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,202
- What?
- Yeah.

350
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:46,943
How you gonna be the baby's daddy?
You know she's lyin'.

351
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:50,573
I broke up with D'wana
two Fridays ago.

352
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:54,915
I got a restraining order on her,
and she don't care about that.

353
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:57,217
- What?
- She got me fuckin' up.

354
00:20:57,289 --> 00:21:00,747
I broke up with her two months ago,
two Fridays ago...

355
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:05,490
and she don't care about
no restraining order or nothin'.

356
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:09,000
- You all right with them pants?
- Get out of my business.

357
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:12,400
How you gonna have
a restraining order on your girl?

358
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:15,736
What's up with y'all?
Where'd you meet her?

359
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:18,139
I was on my way to the 'hood
to buy them 20's.

360
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:23,040
I mean, them tens.
They're tens, but I keep 'em clean.

361
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:26,346
I was on my way,
and she had a burger in her hand.

362
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:29,251
I wanted a piece of it,
and I stopped.

363
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:33,018
We got to rappin'.
It was the worst day of my life!

364
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:34,581
Damn.

365
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:38,020
Psycho, huh?

366
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:40,690
She must be worse
than Left Eye from TLC.

367
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:43,929
But this fat bitch ain't burnin'.
That ain't the cold part.

368
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:45,970
She got a sister named Baby D.

369
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:48,302
This fat bitch get physical.

370
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:51,570
She sells dope, do hair and baby-sit
out of the same house.

371
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:53,838
The police don't know
when to go in.

372
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:56,278
I got a restraining order
on her too.

373
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:58,714
You got a restraining order
on a little girl named Baby D?

374
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:00,479
You don't know Baby D.

375
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:02,782
That's why you're lookin' at me,
'cause you don't know Baby D.

376
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:07,416
Her fat ass be snoring,
won't even be asleep, just standing.

377
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,587
Little cupcakes and shit...

378
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:14,928
This bitch know about all the new snacks
before they even hit the street.

379
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,763
All the bootleg snacks.

380
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,564
Year 2000 snacks.

381
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:23,574
Gonna tell me about a new Twinkie
comin' out next month.

382
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:25,439
It's a bad motherfucker.

383
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:30,209
When you bite into a cream-filled,
it shoot all over your mouth.

384
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:34,244
I'm getting ready to go to work.

385
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:38,583
'Cause I'm a player.
I don't have to deal with this shit.

386
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:41,592
You got your shirt on backwards.

387
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,093
Players fuck up.

388
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:45,129
Snatch that shit off your head.

389
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,131
Don't worry about what I'm doin'!

390
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:50,225
Why didn't y'all do nothin'
when that fat bitch jumped on me?

391
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:54,238
Y'all a trip.
I'm running away from here.

392
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:56,398
- We gotta pull over.
- Be quiet!

393
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:59,569
- Fuckin' nuts is hurtin'.
- We got some business to take care of.

394
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:01,077
Shit! Mommy!

395
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:04,013
Keep your mind on the business, man!

396
00:23:04,082 --> 00:23:06,312
I'm gonna kick Craig's butt.

397
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:10,717
Where we goin' anyway, man?

398
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:15,250
Damn, Debo.

399
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:18,091
Fuckin' ass is hurtin'.
What we doin' here anyway?

400
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:21,189
Close your mouth, I'll tell you.
This is how the plan goes.

401
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:25,225
Call over there and say you have
an urgent message for Mr. William Jones.

402
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:26,736
What urgent message?

403
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:30,468
The message is: "Drop everything.
Craig's in trouble. Come quick."

404
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:34,069
- I don't think that's gonna work.
- Just do it!

405
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:36,842
- I don't know the number.
- It's on the building.

406
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,940
Just pick the phone up.

407
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:44,584
I feel five pounds lighter.

408
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:49,123
What? Jealous?

409
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:50,627
What's that?

410
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:56,125
Come on! Where's my burrito?

411
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:59,728
What's wrong with you?
What kind of place is this?

412
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:01,739
Come on!
Give me my stuff!

413
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:05,800
Hello? I got an urgent message
for a nigger named Mr. Willie...

414
00:24:05,877 --> 00:24:07,469
<i>- Willie who?</i>
- It's William, fool!

415
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:10,947
I got an urgent message
for Mr. William Jones.

416
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:13,712
Yeah. The urgent message is:

417
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:16,481
"Drop everything.
Craig's in trouble. Come quick."

418
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:18,750
<i>- Craig who? Who's this?</i>
- Man, nigger!

419
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:21,918
Just tell him
he can call on Tyrone.

420
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:27,628
Tell him it's a friend of the family's.
When you gonna stop hittin' me?

421
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:31,135
I'm gonna bust your ass like Craig did,
knock your eyes straight.

422
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:35,537
- Hot sauce, please.
- Just a second.

423
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:37,370
Hot sauce, thank you.

424
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:39,967
Someone just called to say
Craig's in trouble.

425
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:42,104
- What?
- Craig's in trouble. I don't know.

426
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:45,638
What? Oh, man!
Hold on, Craig. I'm comin'.

427
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:48,652
- Give me my money. Come on.
- Just a second, man.

428
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,712
Come on, Taco Jim.
Give me my money.

429
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:54,384
Come on, man.
Give me my money.

430
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:56,393
Get the fuck outta here.

431
00:24:57,963 --> 00:24:59,988
This is the most ridiculous thing
I've ever seen.

432
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:01,896
What you doin' out of the truck?

433
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:06,729
What the hell's
happening around here?

434
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:13,244
- Kiss my ass.
- Don't take my hot sauce.

435
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:18,713
This ain't bad, right?

436
00:25:18,783 --> 00:25:20,410
Yeah, it is.

437
00:25:20,485 --> 00:25:25,252
That scratch make it real ugly,
make you not even want to drive it.

438
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:36,863
Damn! Who is that?

439
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:38,766
Who?

440
00:25:38,837 --> 00:25:40,270
That's their sister.

441
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:49,469
Damn. You know what?

442
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:52,142
I'm beginning to like
Rancho Cucamonga.

443
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:53,741
- Well, don't like it.
- Why not?

444
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:56,480
We need to improve on
black and brown relations.

445
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:59,991
Because there's been tension between us
and them since they got out the pen.

446
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:02,720
I am trying to keep it peaceful
around here.

447
00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:05,388
I'm tryin' to have none
of that gangsta-thug stuff.

448
00:26:05,463 --> 00:26:07,954
We livin' good,
eatin' shrimps and steak.

449
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:10,058
What you... Don't do...

450
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:12,797
I'm tellin' you,
don't mess with her.

451
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:15,396
Slow down.
Damn, you walk fast.

452
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,842
- I'm Craig. What's your name?
- Karla.

453
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:22,346
Craig and Karla.
That sounds good together, huh?

454
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,143
Yeah, kind of.

455
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:26,274
She's a sack chaser, man!

456
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:29,286
I tried to hit it.
She wouldn't give me none.

457
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:31,288
I bet you don't get none.

458
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:34,189
I bet you don't get it.
I hope you don't get it.

459
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,261
- Where you goin'?
- To the Cucamonga Shopping Center.

460
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:41,424
- Let it go, man!
- I told you.

461
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:43,330
Whites in hot and colors in cold.

462
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:45,926
Gonna ruin my Dickies!

463
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:50,740
Hold this! What the fuck?

464
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:53,437
You got a sexy voice.
Say something in Spanish.

465
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,783
I think Karla's got jungle fever!

466
00:27:05,857 --> 00:27:07,381
You want a ride?

467
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,222
I don't know.

468
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:14,163
Fuck that. Hey, Cheeco!
It's lunchtime!

469
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:17,133
- We're gonna get you a ride.
- Run! Run!

470
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:18,464
What?

471
00:27:18,536 --> 00:27:19,503
Cheeco! Run!

472
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:21,402
- Shit!
- Cheeco, no!

473
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,964
Get that fucker!
You know you like dark meat!

474
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:26,909
Those <i>mayates</i> are fast,
like they're sponsored by Nike.

475
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:29,310
Black man can jump.

476
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:32,248
Joker, get your dog!
This is bullshit!

477
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,376
Joker, call your dog!

478
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:39,647
Man, get off of my car!
Get off of my shit!

479
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:43,189
- I got something for him.
- Get him!

480
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:45,491
Get his ass. Yeah.
Fuck this!

481
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:49,021
I can't believe
he did that to our dog.

482
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:53,230
You Uncle Willie's son.
You don't play that shit.

483
00:27:53,304 --> 00:27:57,536
Cruelty to animals!
Cruelty to animals!

484
00:27:57,609 --> 00:27:59,668
Cheeco, get your ass over here!

485
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:04,238
That's wrong.
He did nothing to you.

486
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:08,983
Get down. Get down.

487
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:11,780
- Sorry.
- Come on.

488
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,721
Look at my roof.

489
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:17,585
You play too much.

490
00:28:17,662 --> 00:28:21,689
If I get in trouble with them...
I got to live here! You don't!

491
00:28:21,766 --> 00:28:24,530
You gonna get me in trouble!

492
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:27,127
Get out of the way!
Move! Just move!

493
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:30,564
Shit!

494
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:33,577
I was just trying to...

495
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:36,580
I was just trying to help
your scary ass.

496
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:41,752
You fuckin' hit my dog!

497
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,311
You're fucked up now!

498
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:47,552
You fucked him up for life!
He's scarred!

499
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:51,418
We'll get you back!

500
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:52,929
Fucker.

501
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:58,124
Nephew, you got perfect timing.

502
00:28:58,203 --> 00:29:02,503
About to start a little puff-puff give
in this motherfucker.

503
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,508
Are you down?

504
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,840
Why don't you sit
next to your auntie.

505
00:29:19,624 --> 00:29:22,559
I know you smoke
a little weed, right?

506
00:29:22,627 --> 00:29:26,324
- Why you say that?
- 'Cause your lip's turning black.

507
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:32,636
Would you like some wine, baby?

508
00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:34,968
No, thank you.

509
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:38,236
Well, how about a little cognac?

510
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:41,107
No. It's kind of early.

511
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:44,774
Shit, I can roll a blunt
better than them bitches in Havana.

512
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:49,011
I know Willie don't let you smoke
in his house...

513
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:51,419
but I'm your Uncle Elroy!

514
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:54,185
I don't give a damn
how high you get in mine...

515
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:57,751
as long as you let me hit it.

516
00:29:57,829 --> 00:29:59,421
Look at that.

517
00:29:59,497 --> 00:30:01,658
Fire that shit up, boy.

518
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:04,930
I'm about to show y'all
who the real Puff Daddy is!

519
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:20,679
Unc.

520
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:27,056
Baby?

521
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:37,291
It's the Bombay!

522
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:01,518
Think they really went to the moon?

523
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:04,289
They say they went to the moon.

524
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:07,058
There ain't no gravity out there.

525
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:13,037
That mean we can get high
and never come down.

526
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:26,045
What numbers did you pick?

527
00:31:26,117 --> 00:31:29,109
Your original aunt picked...

528
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:31,621
six numbers.

529
00:31:31,689 --> 00:31:34,487
She used her weight, I think.

530
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,493
Goddamn.

531
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,800
I know why you got her now.

532
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,402
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

533
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:59,814
<i>Put some hot sauce</i>
<i>on my burrito, baby</i>

534
00:31:59,884 --> 00:32:02,512
<i>Don't you know it's good to me</i>

535
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:06,589
Debo! Debo!

536
00:32:07,892 --> 00:32:11,191
- What?
- I can't feel my legs, man!

537
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:14,197
<i>Put some hot sauce</i>
<i>on my burrito, baby</i>

538
00:32:15,366 --> 00:32:17,698
<i>You know you look good to me</i>

539
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,498
Oh, man, that's good.

540
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:22,437
Just hold on, Craig.
I'm comin', son.

541
00:32:52,937 --> 00:32:55,872
Negro, what the hell
you doin' to my woman?

542
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:59,569
I don't know.
I must...

543
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:02,238
- Suga?
- Huh?

544
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:05,077
What the hell you doin'
to my nephew?

545
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:08,581
I thought that was you, baby.

546
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,177
Come on, baby.

547
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:13,223
I'm faded, feelin' X-rated.

548
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:15,555
It's Mr. Nasty time.

549
00:33:15,626 --> 00:33:19,062
Oh, Mr. Nasty time.

550
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:21,394
It's Mr. Nasty time.

551
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:23,525
Take it easy on my back.

552
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:25,592
Be back in a minute.

553
00:33:30,608 --> 00:33:33,600
Make yourself at home, nephew.

554
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,509
- Come on.
- Thanks.

555
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:47,753
- That's it, that's it.
- Yeah, yeah.

556
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:55,431
Call me Elroy!

557
00:34:01,472 --> 00:34:03,235
- Damn, Unc.
- That's enough.

558
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,233
Get that shit.

559
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,805
<i>Papi,</i> I wish I was
with you right now.

560
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:40,810
Yeah, me too.

561
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:46,114
Yeah? Well, you ever heard
of El Niño?

562
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:48,118
Yeah.

563
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:52,179
Well, this is El Negro.
Come here and let me tap that ass.

564
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:57,551
Delivery.

565
00:34:58,996 --> 00:35:00,520
Got a delivery!

566
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:06,369
- Who is it?
- Got a delivery. Come on, spark plug.

567
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:09,338
I got a delivery.
It's hot out here, buddy.

568
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:11,272
Come on, sparky.

569
00:35:11,342 --> 00:35:13,640
- What's up?
- Nice house.

570
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:16,737
I didn't expect you to answer,
but this is a fine place.

571
00:35:16,814 --> 00:35:19,806
What are you,
one of those entertainer guys?

572
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:22,318
Do you play sports?
What team you play for?

573
00:35:22,386 --> 00:35:25,219
I play for
the Cucamonga Cracker Killers.

574
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:26,722
Don't want any trouble.

575
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:30,852
You don't have to send your posse
out here to do a 187 in my ass.

576
00:35:30,928 --> 00:35:34,796
Just got a little mail
for you to sign, partner.

577
00:35:35,933 --> 00:35:39,164
- What's this?
- A delinquent property tax notice.

578
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:41,171
I hope the Cracker Killers pay well.

579
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:43,400
Otherwise, it's back
to the ghetto you go.

580
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:45,874
Take it easy.
<i>Hustlin' and survivin'</i>

581
00:35:45,943 --> 00:35:48,434
<i>Good times</i>

582
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:50,344
Oh, fuck!

583
00:35:50,414 --> 00:35:52,678
Good boy! Heel!

584
00:35:54,418 --> 00:35:58,582
"Your house will be seized
and auctioned...

585
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:00,817
tomorrow at 9:00 a.m."

586
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:06,152
Tomorrow?

587
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:11,063
Uncle Elroy, you got some mail.

588
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,399
Uncle Elroy, you got a notice.

589
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:54,003
Damn.

590
00:36:54,078 --> 00:36:56,012
Unc is a freak.

591
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:12,395
Unc, you got this tax notice, man.

592
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,426
Come here!
I'll tear that ass up again!

593
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:22,063
I like it when you treat me rough!

594
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:24,266
God, man, what you doin'?

595
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:29,205
Get your hands off my ass, girl!

596
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,147
Let me go!
Let me go, goddamn it!

597
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:44,027
Yo, Day-Day, check it out.

598
00:37:48,332 --> 00:37:51,324
If Pinky come in and see you doin'
that <i>X- Game</i> shit off the counter...

599
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:52,835
we'll get fired.

600
00:37:52,903 --> 00:37:55,872
Motherfuckers! You motherfuckers!
What the fuck is this?

601
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,874
- You motherfuckers!
- Can I help you?

602
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:00,206
Yes. What is this, huh?

603
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:03,304
This is rock.
I can't get jiggy with this shit.

604
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:05,872
Where's the damn manager?
That Pink motherfucker.

605
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,214
The manager's not here.
I'm running the store.

606
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:11,050
You look like the player-hater
who sold me this shit.

607
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:13,920
Give me my money back now!
And I have no damn receipt.

608
00:38:13,991 --> 00:38:15,925
- Where's the cover?
- I have no damn cover!

609
00:38:15,993 --> 00:38:19,326
- Kiss my ass! So what?
- Can I see it, sir?

610
00:38:20,865 --> 00:38:23,356
You been chewin' on this
before you came here?

611
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:26,301
Bullshit! You know
who you're fucking with?

612
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:29,464
- Bishop Tutu?
- Try again, motherfucker.

613
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:32,065
- Winnie Mandela's little...
- Try again, motherfucker!

614
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:33,576
Just an ugly black dude.

615
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,612
I'll go postal on this motherfucker!

616
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,547
You better get your hostile ass
out of here.

617
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:40,709
You bitch.

618
00:38:41,585 --> 00:38:42,813
Oh, shit!

619
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:47,589
Don't hit me. This is John Blaze.
I can get jiggy with it.

620
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:50,422
- Get your ass out of here!
- I'm just a bitch-ass nigger.

621
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,826
- Don't hit me!
- You see that?

622
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:58,762
- How'd you get out here?
- I walked.

623
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:01,669
You can't walk around this white
neighborhood. You look suspect.

624
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:03,900
Y'all got a notice,
certified mail.

625
00:39:03,974 --> 00:39:07,341
Craig, this is Roach,
my white slave.

626
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:10,869
Roach works around the store
doin' anything I tell him to.

627
00:39:10,948 --> 00:39:12,939
That's my cousin Craig
who beat up Debo.

628
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:14,780
What's up, bro?

629
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:17,116
- What's up?
- What do we got?

630
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:23,584
- You know what this is?
- What is it?

631
00:39:23,661 --> 00:39:26,221
Get the phone!
You wouldn't know about this.

632
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:29,232
- This is black problems.
- Pinky's.

633
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:32,060
Yeah.

634
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:35,970
We probably don't owe too much 'cause
we ain't been spending money that much.

635
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,967
- Oh, man!
- What?

636
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:41,102
We owe 3,900 by tomorrow.

637
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:43,169
Shit, man!

638
00:39:43,247 --> 00:39:45,181
How much y'all got
from the lottery?

639
00:39:45,249 --> 00:39:47,740
I don't know.
I bought some shoes.

640
00:39:47,818 --> 00:39:49,911
I gotta check my book.

641
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:52,319
- Check your bank book.
- Go back here with me.

642
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:56,326
That African might have circled
around the block or something.

643
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:01,588
Yeah, he's here.

644
00:40:01,665 --> 00:40:04,429
No, he's right here.
All right.

645
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:07,994
- $247.
- That's it?

646
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:11,301
- Who was that?
- This girl named D'wana.

647
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:16,210
- She's outside and wants to talk to you.
- Come here. Get over here.

648
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,611
Shit.

649
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:38,925
- What's the matter?
- D'wana brought Baby D's fat ass here.

650
00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:42,232
Come on, D.
Let's fuck this nigger up.

651
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:54,209
That white boy
said he was in here.

652
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:57,220
Day-Day! Don't make me
break this window!

653
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,313
- Craig, do me a favor.
- What?

654
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:03,486
- Go tell them I ain't here.
- Hell no. I ain't in it.

655
00:41:03,561 --> 00:41:07,190
- You already in it, cuz.
- I'll just go do it.

656
00:41:07,264 --> 00:41:10,290
Get your ass back here!
What the fuck you doin'?

657
00:41:10,367 --> 00:41:14,360
She'll sit on your little ass.
Craig gotta do it.

658
00:41:14,438 --> 00:41:16,872
He beat Debo ass.

659
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:19,501
And he cold. Craig?

660
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:21,602
You gonna do that for me?

661
00:41:24,114 --> 00:41:25,604
Go ahead, man.

662
00:41:29,286 --> 00:41:31,550
Hurry up, nigger!

663
00:41:31,622 --> 00:41:33,214
Shut up.

664
00:41:36,527 --> 00:41:38,495
That don't look like Day-Day.

665
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:43,128
Open the door.

666
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:47,003
Day-Day ain't here.

667
00:41:47,071 --> 00:41:49,130
- Who are you?
- I'm his cousin.

668
00:41:49,206 --> 00:41:51,140
We didn't come here for Day-Day.

669
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:53,802
- Yes, you did.
- No, we came to buy a CD.

670
00:41:53,878 --> 00:41:55,812
- Move!
- Punk.

671
00:42:00,484 --> 00:42:03,146
These whores ain't got no manners.

672
00:42:07,057 --> 00:42:10,026
Where that boy tellin' me
Day-Day was here?

673
00:42:10,094 --> 00:42:14,053
I don't know. I think he went
out back to throw away some boxes.

674
00:42:14,131 --> 00:42:17,464
- Well, can I look for myself?
- No, you cannot.

675
00:42:18,836 --> 00:42:21,964
- Hey, ladies.
- Where's Day-Day?

676
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:25,372
- I thought y'all wanted to buy a CD.
- I do.

677
00:42:25,442 --> 00:42:28,275
Can you show me
where the jazz section is?

678
00:42:28,345 --> 00:42:29,972
Jazz?

679
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:34,416
You know damn well
you don't want to hear jazz.

680
00:42:34,485 --> 00:42:36,009
Come on.

681
00:42:38,322 --> 00:42:40,153
I know y'all playin' games.

682
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:43,387
If Day-Day come back,
tell him I need to see him...

683
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:46,122
'cause the child-carin' classes
start on Wednesday.

684
00:42:46,196 --> 00:42:49,427
Come on, D.
I ain't got time for this. Wait.

685
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,559
Ain't your restroom this way?

686
00:42:51,635 --> 00:42:54,001
You better have some toilet paper.

687
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:57,837
- Damn!
- Here he is! Baby, here he is!

688
00:42:57,908 --> 00:42:59,773
Here, Baby! Get him!

689
00:43:05,182 --> 00:43:08,310
Come on. You better go on
with the bullshit.

690
00:43:08,385 --> 00:43:09,818
Do something about it!

691
00:43:09,887 --> 00:43:12,879
Why don't y'all do something
about this shit?

692
00:43:18,896 --> 00:43:21,296
- Come on!
- She moves well for a big girl.

693
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,538
You better quit with the bullshit!

694
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:32,303
- You better stop runnin' from that girl.
- Fuck you!

695
00:43:32,376 --> 00:43:36,176
Come on, big Baby D.
D'wana, I don't even like you like that.

696
00:43:36,246 --> 00:43:39,409
- Somebody call Jenny Craig.
- Hello. Remember me?

697
00:43:42,086 --> 00:43:44,111
Hell yeah, I remember you.

698
00:43:44,188 --> 00:43:47,157
I'm sorry about what my brothers
did to you this morning.

699
00:43:47,224 --> 00:43:48,657
They're just assholes.

700
00:43:48,726 --> 00:43:50,694
You don't have to apologize
for your brothers.

701
00:43:52,563 --> 00:43:55,896
I wanted to give you this.

702
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:57,900
If my brothers weren't
so overprotective...

703
00:43:57,968 --> 00:44:01,529
I'd have you call the house, but for now
page me when you get a chance.

704
00:44:01,605 --> 00:44:04,165
- I'll do that.
- Better sooner than later.

705
00:44:04,241 --> 00:44:05,674
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

706
00:44:05,743 --> 00:44:07,677
Shit, it might be tonight.

707
00:44:07,745 --> 00:44:09,406
Get your ass back!

708
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:13,747
Baby D, go on with the bullshit!

709
00:44:15,586 --> 00:44:18,487
You ain't gonna catch me,
as usual.

710
00:44:18,555 --> 00:44:22,150
Let's make a deal while we can.
You're not gonna catch me.

711
00:44:22,226 --> 00:44:24,694
What you want?
Another Big Pun CD? Kelly Price?

712
00:44:24,762 --> 00:44:26,593
- Luther Vandross?
- Hell no.

713
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:29,861
That ain't gonna do?
How about that?

714
00:44:29,933 --> 00:44:32,868
Just like you had in the jail
commissary... without the wrapper.

715
00:44:32,936 --> 00:44:34,426
You can get to it quick.

716
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:37,736
- I'm on a diet.
- No, your fat ass ain't.

717
00:44:37,808 --> 00:44:39,901
Yeah. Taste it, Baby D.

718
00:44:39,977 --> 00:44:42,241
Damn, it's good! Eat that...

719
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:47,443
- Your cousin Craig, hook us up.
- That's it?

720
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:52,516
Just tell him to come over here
and talk to me.

721
00:44:52,589 --> 00:44:56,116
- And I can go free?
- Go before I change my mind!

722
00:45:01,932 --> 00:45:03,627
What happened?

723
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:07,034
Made a deal.
All you gotta do is go over there.

724
00:45:07,104 --> 00:45:10,437
- You gotta talk to her.
- What do you mean, "talk to her"?

725
00:45:10,507 --> 00:45:13,533
- She want to talk to you.
- Talk to me?

726
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:19,245
Go talk to her.
Mother love. Fat...

727
00:45:22,486 --> 00:45:24,147
I'm gone.

728
00:45:25,189 --> 00:45:27,749
- Come on!
- Day-Day, I'm gonna kill your ass!

729
00:45:27,825 --> 00:45:29,918
You gotta come outside sometime!

730
00:45:31,361 --> 00:45:34,888
See, I done told you.
I done told you.

731
00:45:37,968 --> 00:45:40,163
Why you let her do this shit?

732
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:43,104
- What was that?
- You don't wanna know.

733
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:46,903
- Thanks a lot, Craig.
- Look.

734
00:45:46,977 --> 00:45:49,673
We cousins, but don't be tryin'
to hook me up...

735
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:52,341
with the little sister
that's bigger than the big sister.

736
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:55,852
- Fat bitches need love, too, Craig.
- For sure.

737
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:04,525
Oh, man!

738
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:06,529
Oh, my stomach.

739
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:09,157
Say, let me get by!

740
00:46:10,067 --> 00:46:12,934
Too much hot sauce.
I gotta go to the bathroom.

741
00:46:16,573 --> 00:46:19,064
I gotta go to the bathroom.

742
00:46:20,244 --> 00:46:22,337
Let me over!

743
00:46:23,914 --> 00:46:25,438
Somebody help me, please!

744
00:46:26,683 --> 00:46:28,344
Too much traffic.

745
00:46:28,418 --> 00:46:31,251
What's this traffic doin'?

746
00:46:31,321 --> 00:46:34,552
Hey, y'all, move over!
Move up! Everybody, move!

747
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:45,802
- Worst day of my life.
- Damn, you sad.

748
00:46:45,869 --> 00:46:48,201
I know how you're feelin', man.

749
00:46:48,272 --> 00:46:51,799
If I had my bong on me now,
I'd let you toke till you choke.

750
00:46:51,875 --> 00:46:53,399
I got this, though.

751
00:46:56,713 --> 00:47:00,547
- What's that green shit hangin' out?
- That's chronic, dude. Try it.

752
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:07,921
I ain't got no bong
or no bullshit brownie, but voilà.

753
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:09,117
Whoa!

754
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,328
I'm the one with the problems!

755
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:15,994
- Shit.
- Enjoy, man.

756
00:47:20,237 --> 00:47:22,705
Better open that window
before the smell get out.

757
00:47:22,773 --> 00:47:25,503
- These windows don't work in here.
- I got an idea.

758
00:47:25,576 --> 00:47:29,012
It's just a theory, but it should work.
Check this out.

759
00:47:35,385 --> 00:47:37,319
- Blow?
- Yeah, blow.

760
00:47:37,387 --> 00:47:40,015
- That ain't gonna work.
- Fuck yeah.

761
00:47:45,162 --> 00:47:48,290
- It works.
- Still gonna smell it.

762
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:51,095
Uh-uh. Watch.

763
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:01,043
Stop bullshittin'!

764
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:09,385
- Stop bullshittin'!
- My fault, my fault.

765
00:48:09,453 --> 00:48:13,651
You better stop playin' so much!
Almost sucked my motherfuckin' lip up!

766
00:48:49,126 --> 00:48:50,889
Look here, baby.

767
00:48:50,961 --> 00:48:53,589
You hittin' them corners
too goddamn fast.

768
00:48:53,664 --> 00:48:56,098
You need to slow
this motherfucker down.

769
00:48:56,166 --> 00:49:00,296
I almost spilled my yak
on this $200 suit, nigger.

770
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:02,964
Come on, baby,
get it together. Damn.

771
00:49:05,876 --> 00:49:07,867
Yeah, whatever, motherfucker.

772
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:23,725
Shit.

773
00:49:35,038 --> 00:49:36,801
Roach, what you doin'?

774
00:49:44,348 --> 00:49:46,316
I caught a bad one again.

775
00:49:46,383 --> 00:49:48,214
<i>You busters is bitches</i>

776
00:49:48,285 --> 00:49:51,311
<i>You can't get your money</i>
<i>from your bitches</i>

777
00:49:51,388 --> 00:49:54,824
- Get back!
- Stop that bullshit, man!

778
00:49:54,891 --> 00:49:57,325
This vacuum shit don't work, man.

779
00:49:57,394 --> 00:50:00,386
Don't grab on Pinky's shit
like that.

780
00:50:01,798 --> 00:50:03,390
You company man.

781
00:50:03,467 --> 00:50:06,231
"Don't grab on Pinky's shit
like that."

782
00:50:06,303 --> 00:50:08,328
- Nigger, this is how I...
- Pinky?

783
00:50:08,405 --> 00:50:11,897
Pinky used to be a player.
I heard about Pinky...

784
00:50:11,975 --> 00:50:13,840
Where the bathroom at?

785
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:15,673
Go to the right.

786
00:50:15,746 --> 00:50:18,772
Don't do that, man!
You gonna burn my Pinky shirt!

787
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:21,340
I was just gonna get a promotion!

788
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:27,282
Light an incense in there too.

789
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:31,225
You stanky, booty-ass, little boy.
What's up, Roach?

790
00:50:31,294 --> 00:50:32,886
You bust your shit?

791
00:50:34,965 --> 00:50:36,592
Don't move!

792
00:50:39,503 --> 00:50:43,337
I'll blow your goddamn head
smooth off.

793
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:46,733
Now, back up.

794
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:48,744
Slowly!

795
00:50:48,812 --> 00:50:50,473
Don't say a word.

796
00:50:53,417 --> 00:50:56,250
- Hey, man...
- I said, don't say a word.

797
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:58,253
Craig went to take a doo-doo.

798
00:50:58,321 --> 00:51:01,916
You ain't seen him
gettin' nothin' in the... to try to...

799
00:51:01,992 --> 00:51:05,325
- He miss?
- He don't try to make it fresh in there.

800
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:07,920
Come on.

801
00:51:07,998 --> 00:51:10,831
Little motherfucker
gonna try to rob me.

802
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:14,837
I'm gonna show you
how we do it here in Pinky's.

803
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:17,339
- I wasn't tryin' to rob...
- Shut up!

804
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:20,274
Before I bust a cap up in your ass.

805
00:51:20,343 --> 00:51:23,437
What you gone done
with Day-Day and Roach?

806
00:51:23,513 --> 00:51:25,504
- Day-Day is my...
- Shut up!

807
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:31,353
- Now, who sent you, nigger?
- Nobody sent...

808
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:36,518
Say another motherfuckin' word,
and this shit is over!

809
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:38,754
And I ain't playin', nigger!

810
00:51:40,664 --> 00:51:43,030
Now...

811
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:45,762
you ain't got no gun...

812
00:51:45,836 --> 00:51:48,100
but where the weed at?

813
00:51:48,171 --> 00:51:51,334
- I ain't got no...
- Shut the fuck... Shut...

814
00:51:51,408 --> 00:51:53,308
Did I say...

815
00:51:53,376 --> 00:51:56,311
Oh, shit, say it again!
Say something else!

816
00:51:57,948 --> 00:52:00,815
Say something else!
Say something else, nigger!

817
00:52:02,552 --> 00:52:05,715
I'm gonna tie your monkey-ass up.

818
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:08,383
Oh, shit!

819
00:52:12,896 --> 00:52:14,830
He been doo-dooin' a long time.

820
00:52:14,898 --> 00:52:17,924
When he was a kid,
he doo-dooed in church.

821
00:52:18,001 --> 00:52:21,698
The pastor was the only one that could
stay in there through the blessings.

822
00:52:21,771 --> 00:52:23,966
I got your ass!

823
00:52:25,742 --> 00:52:27,232
Oh, shit.

824
00:52:33,049 --> 00:52:34,983
Craig doo-dooed
in the swimming pool.

825
00:52:35,051 --> 00:52:38,885
- We were swimming when we were little.
- Did it float up like a submarine?

826
00:52:38,955 --> 00:52:41,924
I was swimming, and I thought
it was a chocolate PayDay.

827
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:45,257
I was swimmin' like a motherfucker,
and something just went...

828
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:46,920
It kind of hit my...

829
00:52:48,298 --> 00:52:50,732
I got this motherfucker!

830
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:58,941
Gonna blow up
where I make my money at.

831
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:00,704
Is he comin'?

832
00:53:00,777 --> 00:53:03,974
Let me tell you something.
Can I say something to you?

833
00:53:04,047 --> 00:53:07,244
- I love you, man.
- Either be smokin' or be passin' that.

834
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:21,929
I got to think of a way
to get this money by tomorrow.

835
00:53:21,998 --> 00:53:24,831
- Huh?
- I gotta think of..."Huh?"

836
00:53:24,901 --> 00:53:27,199
I gotta get this money by tomorrow.

837
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:31,229
- You could sell your Beemer.
- I can do what?

838
00:53:31,308 --> 00:53:33,299
- Sell your car.
- Sell your mama's car.

839
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:35,571
I'm not sellin' my car, man.

840
00:53:35,645 --> 00:53:38,978
- My bad.
- Don't say nothin' like that.

841
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:41,449
- I know you love that car.
- Hell yeah.

842
00:53:41,518 --> 00:53:43,452
I gotta think of a plan.

843
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:47,115
I hope Craig got some kind of plan
while he takin' a shit.

844
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:49,954
- He in there a long time.
- Yeah, he in there a long time.

845
00:53:50,026 --> 00:53:52,551
Let's clean up
before Pinky get back.

846
00:53:56,633 --> 00:53:59,830
What's up, baby?
Come on, young blood. Don't kill me.

847
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:02,167
Shut up!

848
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:05,834
I been tryin' to tell your ass
that Day-Day's my cousin.

849
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:07,342
He in the back.

850
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:09,469
Whatever you say, baby.

851
00:54:09,546 --> 00:54:14,643
I swear to God, man, the combination
to the safe is 34-5-27, man.

852
00:54:14,718 --> 00:54:17,653
Just take it all, baby.
It's all yours. Just don't kill me.

853
00:54:17,721 --> 00:54:21,248
I got kids, a motherfuckin' girlfriend
and a wife on the side.

854
00:54:21,324 --> 00:54:22,484
Shut up!

855
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:27,290
Don't kill me!
Goddamn, don't kill me!

856
00:54:28,665 --> 00:54:32,499
- Craig, what you doin'?
- Nothin'.

857
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:36,764
- Huh?
- Is this your cousin?

858
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:40,298
- Yeah, that's my cousin.
- Good. Then you fired.

859
00:54:40,377 --> 00:54:42,368
- Who, me?
- Yeah, you.

860
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:43,878
I'm fired?

861
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:47,007
- Roach, you fired too.
- Why you gotta fire me for?

862
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:49,881
Shut up! Shut up!

863
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:52,217
You better keep
your goddamn mouth shut!

864
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:55,053
- Bobby Womack.
- I heard that shit. Say it again.

865
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:58,124
Shit!

866
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:01,229
And you lucky.

867
00:55:02,032 --> 00:55:04,967
I was just fixin'
to get up in your ass.

868
00:55:05,035 --> 00:55:08,129
Give me my pistol!
Get out of my store.

869
00:55:08,204 --> 00:55:10,172
Shut up!

870
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,868
Punk ass.

871
00:55:12,942 --> 00:55:15,877
Tryin' to rob me.
Nigger, I'm Pinky.

872
00:55:17,447 --> 00:55:20,507
That nigger had me scared,
but I held my own.

873
00:55:20,617 --> 00:55:24,747
Fat bitch is bustin' my windows
all the time.

874
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:27,756
I knew you shouldn't...
When you goin' home?

875
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:29,485
<i>D's sayin'.</i>

876
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:34,326
<i>In a strange way, I feel responsible</i>
<i>for Day-Day gettin' fired.</i>

877
00:55:34,397 --> 00:55:38,163
<i>If I wouldn't have fought Pinky</i>
<i>and gave Day-Day that joint...</i>

878
00:55:38,234 --> 00:55:40,725
<i>he'd still have a job by now.</i>

879
00:55:40,804 --> 00:55:42,635
<i>Roach too.</i>

880
00:55:42,706 --> 00:55:44,196
That's true.

881
00:55:44,274 --> 00:55:46,299
<i>Got to think of something...</i>

882
00:55:46,376 --> 00:55:49,607
- Fat bitch bust my windows...
<i>- as soon as he shut the fuck up.</i>

883
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:53,445
You ain't even help me.
You watched her do the shit.

884
00:55:54,751 --> 00:55:57,845
And you quit hanging around
black people. You see how we live?

885
00:55:57,921 --> 00:56:01,448
We live wild. We live rough.
I'm tellin' you.

886
00:56:29,319 --> 00:56:31,981
Damn, Daddy,
I didn't know you had titties.

887
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:36,548
We got a certified this
in the mail today.

888
00:56:41,164 --> 00:56:44,622
And I got fired today.

889
00:56:46,636 --> 00:56:47,967
Daddy!

890
00:56:49,539 --> 00:56:52,531
Mr. White Man, tell me what happened.
What's up there?

891
00:56:52,609 --> 00:56:55,942
<i>Mister, I gotta go help my son.</i>
<i>Let me over, please. Let me over.</i>

892
00:56:56,012 --> 00:56:59,812
I gotta help myself too.
I got a burning in my stomach.

893
00:56:59,883 --> 00:57:02,909
My stomach hurts. Oh, man.

894
00:57:02,986 --> 00:57:05,386
Officer, please.
Don't just drive past me.

895
00:57:05,455 --> 00:57:06,786
Officer!

896
00:57:06,856 --> 00:57:09,324
How long we gotta ride
in this stupid-ass van anyway?

897
00:57:09,392 --> 00:57:12,759
Fuck, I don't know. Shut up, man! Raise
your hand if you want to talk to me!

898
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:17,164
Man, what we gonna do?

899
00:57:17,233 --> 00:57:19,394
I don't know yet.

900
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:21,164
I know what I'm gonna do.

901
00:57:21,237 --> 00:57:23,262
I'm goin' home and face the music.

902
00:57:23,339 --> 00:57:26,604
My dad finds out I got fired again,
man, he's gonna kick my ass.

903
00:57:26,676 --> 00:57:30,112
- Sorry about today.
- Yeah, me too. Later.

904
00:57:38,354 --> 00:57:41,187
- My board!
- Get the board!

905
00:57:46,663 --> 00:57:48,995
My skateboard.

906
00:57:49,065 --> 00:57:51,431
Let's play some quarters and shit.
And don't forget the chips.

907
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:57,133
- What the fuck you lookin' at?
- Nothin'. I...

908
00:57:59,409 --> 00:58:02,537
- You broke my board.
- It shouldn't have been in the street.

909
00:58:04,214 --> 00:58:06,910
Take me to Judge Judy. Let's go.

910
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:09,679
- Who the fuck are those guys, Day-Day?
- Let it go, man. Trust me.

911
00:58:09,752 --> 00:58:12,152
I ain't lettin' shit go, man!
They broke my skateboard!

912
00:58:12,222 --> 00:58:15,191
- Let it go! Trust me.
- Wait a minute. Wait, wait! Look.

913
00:58:18,394 --> 00:58:20,589
- You see that?
- I ain't see nothin'.

914
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:23,029
Must be money or somethin'
in that hydraulic pump.

915
00:58:23,099 --> 00:58:25,260
Yeah, air.

916
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:28,702
It's somethin' better than air.
I could tell how funny he act.

917
00:58:28,771 --> 00:58:31,535
Hey, how's it goin', boy?
Come here. Yeah, boy, come here.

918
00:58:31,608 --> 00:58:35,066
Hey! What are you doin'?
Get the fuck off me!

919
00:58:35,144 --> 00:58:37,237
How do you know for sure?
It could be any damn thing in that pump.

920
00:58:37,313 --> 00:58:40,544
I don't know. It could be anything, but
I say we go over there and take a look.

921
00:58:40,617 --> 00:58:42,551
I say you go by your damn self.

922
00:58:42,619 --> 00:58:45,986
I'm not fuckin' with them <i>eses.</i> Y'all go
over there and tag team and that shit.

923
00:58:46,055 --> 00:58:48,717
All we need is
a big-ass pack of bologna.

924
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:53,052
- Bologna?
- Yeah, bologna!

925
00:58:53,963 --> 00:58:59,162
Want me to get cheese and the hot plate?
We can cook over there. Eat with them...

926
00:58:59,235 --> 00:59:01,703
Man, just go get the bologna.
Hurry up.

927
00:59:06,609 --> 00:59:10,067
Is that a gas station over there?
Here we go. That's a gas station.

928
00:59:12,148 --> 00:59:14,082
Get out the way, man!
Come on! Move!

929
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:16,084
This fool can't drive for shit!

930
00:59:16,953 --> 00:59:21,947
Guess I'm gonna have to kill that dad
of his, too, when I finish with Craig.

931
00:59:22,025 --> 00:59:24,994
Hey, man, get out the way!
Get out of the way! Hurry up!

932
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:27,029
You look! I got some business
to take care of!

933
00:59:27,096 --> 00:59:29,462
- Fuck you, asshole!
- I hope the bathroom is clean.

934
00:59:29,532 --> 00:59:32,865
If it ain't, I don't give a damn.

935
00:59:32,936 --> 00:59:36,133
Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, me.

936
00:59:41,544 --> 00:59:44,172
Damn! I knew I shouldn't
have eaten all that hot sauce.

937
00:59:48,384 --> 00:59:52,115
Sabu! I've seen all your movies, man.
Oh, you bad.

938
00:59:52,188 --> 00:59:54,816
Ridin' that magic carpet.
They ain't got to worry about no gas.

939
00:59:55,758 --> 00:59:58,556
Can I get the key to the bathroom?
I don't wanna buy no hubcap.

940
00:59:58,628 --> 01:00:00,357
It is here.

941
01:00:01,497 --> 01:00:03,465
And say hello to Qaddafi for me.

942
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:11,198
- Hey!
- Hey!

943
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:13,208
Come on out of there!
I got an emergency here!

944
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:16,803
- Hold on!
- Come on, man! Come on out of there.

945
01:00:16,879 --> 01:00:20,337
- Who's bangin' on this friggin' door...
- Come on outta here.

946
01:00:20,416 --> 01:00:22,350
- Mr. Jones?
- Stanley?

947
01:00:22,418 --> 01:00:24,477
- How are ya?
- What are you doin' here?

948
01:00:24,554 --> 01:00:28,149
I'm looking for a new house out here.
I have to move out of the hood.

949
01:00:28,224 --> 01:00:30,784
- The crime is really getting bad.
- Yeah, I gotta go.

950
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:34,591
I wouldn't recommend that anybody
go in there for at least 35, 45 minutes.

951
01:00:34,664 --> 01:00:36,632
It's smelling pretty bad.
I don't know what happened.

952
01:00:36,699 --> 01:00:38,792
Get the fuck outta my face!

953
01:00:41,237 --> 01:00:43,171
Oh, Lord!

954
01:00:49,412 --> 01:00:51,004
Thank God.

955
01:00:56,819 --> 01:00:58,753
Come on. Stay down.

956
01:01:01,557 --> 01:01:03,787
- Y'all ready?
- No.

957
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:05,293
Come on.

958
01:01:08,398 --> 01:01:10,491
There's Joker! Run!
Goddamn it! Run!

959
01:01:14,904 --> 01:01:16,997
I don't see nobody.

960
01:01:17,073 --> 01:01:18,506
Come on.

961
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:22,043
Hurry up.

962
01:01:25,448 --> 01:01:27,609
Nice booty.

963
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:30,847
- Come here. You can have some.
- You know I do.

964
01:01:32,288 --> 01:01:35,724
- Where you goin', baby?
- Right over here.

965
01:01:35,792 --> 01:01:38,192
I'm nervous, man.
I got the BGs.

966
01:01:38,261 --> 01:01:41,287
- What's the BGs?
- The bubble guts.

967
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:44,162
I'm nervous, and
I'm about to shit on myself.

968
01:01:44,233 --> 01:01:46,895
Keep a tight ass.
Try and hold it in or somethin'.

969
01:01:46,969 --> 01:01:48,231
Shut up.

970
01:01:48,304 --> 01:01:50,431
That sound like butterflies to me.

971
01:01:50,506 --> 01:01:52,872
Butterflies, your ass.
I'm about to go home.

972
01:01:52,942 --> 01:01:57,675
Look, look. If we don't go do this,
you ain't gonna have no home to go to.

973
01:01:57,747 --> 01:02:01,581
All we gotta do is find out
where the little one put that pump...

974
01:02:01,651 --> 01:02:03,846
take it and see what's in it.

975
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:07,788
You're in the Kentucky Derby.
I'll take this off.

976
01:02:10,693 --> 01:02:12,217
Oh, shit.

977
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:16,023
Go, Flea Biscuit.

978
01:02:16,099 --> 01:02:17,691
Thought you were gonna
take me to see Mommy.

979
01:02:19,702 --> 01:02:22,637
I'm a little preoccupied right now.

980
01:02:23,706 --> 01:02:24,968
I'll take you later.

981
01:02:25,041 --> 01:02:27,032
When? After you're
all drunk and loaded?

982
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:29,670
I said I'll take
your stupid ass later, all right?

983
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:31,941
Get the fuck outta here.
You're ruining my company.

984
01:02:39,856 --> 01:02:42,381
- What's this silver thing right here?
- What silver thing?

985
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:48,055
We got to count that shit.
Get up.

986
01:02:48,131 --> 01:02:50,497
Business first.

987
01:02:50,566 --> 01:02:52,591
Hey, Baby Joker, come on.

988
01:02:52,668 --> 01:02:54,431
Forgot about the business.

989
01:02:55,505 --> 01:03:00,465
I need you to occupy that dog long
enough for me and Day-Day to get a look.

990
01:03:00,543 --> 01:03:03,478
Me and dogs don't get along, bro.

991
01:03:03,546 --> 01:03:06,743
- Get along with this one.
- Shit. What's his name?

992
01:03:06,816 --> 01:03:10,377
Cheeco. You've got to go ahead of us.
Don't get seen.

993
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:12,819
And for damn sure,
don't let that mutt out your sight.

994
01:03:12,889 --> 01:03:14,618
Go, go, go!

995
01:03:14,690 --> 01:03:19,286
- Dog, we scored today, fool.
- Yeah!

996
01:03:19,362 --> 01:03:22,729
- What's that on my leg?
- What is that, dog?

997
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:25,427
Forget it. I think
it's yogurt or something.

998
01:03:34,343 --> 01:03:35,776
Here, Cheeco.

999
01:03:42,585 --> 01:03:44,610
Get off my ass, man.

1000
01:03:47,523 --> 01:03:51,220
Get down! You guys are better
than the Soul Train dancers.

1001
01:03:51,294 --> 01:03:53,091
Look at them old bitties.

1002
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:55,130
God!

1003
01:03:55,198 --> 01:03:57,632
Come on. Let's go. Get up.

1004
01:03:59,802 --> 01:04:01,793
All right, go first.

1005
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:05,607
- Go first.
- No, nigger, you go first!

1006
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:07,939
I'm not goin' first.

1007
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:10,911
If you don't hit that fence,
I'm gonna throw you over.

1008
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:13,039
Nigger, I'm not...
We ain't little no more.

1009
01:04:13,115 --> 01:04:16,846
That's the thing about it.
Come on. Come on!

1010
01:04:16,919 --> 01:04:20,047
What you talkin' about?
We ain't little? What?

1011
01:04:20,122 --> 01:04:21,885
Come on, nigger.

1012
01:04:21,958 --> 01:04:23,448
- Pussy.
- It ain't like that.

1013
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:25,517
Get your ass up.

1014
01:04:41,310 --> 01:04:43,073
- Stop playing.
- I broke a butt cheek.

1015
01:04:43,145 --> 01:04:46,410
- Come on.
- Shit, man.

1016
01:04:46,482 --> 01:04:48,211
What, man?

1017
01:04:48,284 --> 01:04:49,717
Fuck.

1018
01:04:53,089 --> 01:04:54,852
Come here, boy.

1019
01:04:54,924 --> 01:04:56,858
Come on, Cheeco.

1020
01:04:56,926 --> 01:04:58,860
Be a good boy.

1021
01:04:59,762 --> 01:05:01,423
Shit! Oh, shit.

1022
01:05:03,199 --> 01:05:06,032
- Fuck this shit.
- Hey, hey. Wait.

1023
01:05:10,439 --> 01:05:12,907
- Who's got the money...
- He's still over there.

1024
01:05:12,975 --> 01:05:15,102
- Hundreds, fifties.
- Roach still got him.

1025
01:05:19,448 --> 01:05:22,884
- What do we do with these ones?
- Fuck it. Give it to charity.

1026
01:05:22,952 --> 01:05:25,546
Fuck it.
Charity starts in <i>la casa.</i>

1027
01:05:25,621 --> 01:05:27,987
- We can give it to the bitches.
- It is money in that pump.

1028
01:05:28,057 --> 01:05:29,547
- It is?
- Yeah.

1029
01:05:29,625 --> 01:05:31,490
A good boy. Come on.

1030
01:05:32,328 --> 01:05:34,159
Here you go. Good boy.

1031
01:05:35,364 --> 01:05:38,458
Good boy. I got
some good bologna for you.

1032
01:05:38,534 --> 01:05:42,493
Good boy. Eat it all up.

1033
01:05:42,571 --> 01:05:45,005
Okay, you ate it all up.

1034
01:05:51,314 --> 01:05:53,578
Is that Cheeco?
What's wrong with him?

1035
01:05:53,649 --> 01:05:56,846
I don't know.
That dog got issues.

1036
01:05:58,354 --> 01:06:01,448
So what's wrong with my <i>perro?</i>
What'd you do to my dog, fool?

1037
01:06:01,524 --> 01:06:05,585
Nothing. Just keep
counting the money.

1038
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:10,724
Hey, fuck that shit. Do it later.

1039
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,997
It's fuckin' Friday.
We got fuckin' bitches.

1040
01:06:14,070 --> 01:06:15,833
It's fuckin' time to party.

1041
01:06:15,905 --> 01:06:18,169
Shut the door. What's wrong with you?
Don't you got no manners?

1042
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:20,936
- What's wrong with you?
- Fuckin' snapper.

1043
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:25,276
We're not gonna close the door
until you come out and party with us.

1044
01:06:25,348 --> 01:06:27,282
Let me think about it.

1045
01:06:27,350 --> 01:06:31,411
Count my money.
Party with bitches.

1046
01:06:31,487 --> 01:06:34,217
Hundreds and fifties.
Big-ass titties.

1047
01:06:35,524 --> 01:06:40,154
Count the green.
Get in between those titties.

1048
01:06:40,229 --> 01:06:41,696
Let's party!

1049
01:06:41,764 --> 01:06:44,130
Come on, fool!

1050
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:46,691
Put that shit in the drawer.

1051
01:06:46,769 --> 01:06:50,728
I'm in the mood to get jiggy with it.
I wanna party.

1052
01:06:50,806 --> 01:06:52,899
Aztec warrior. Aztec warrior.

1053
01:07:00,649 --> 01:07:04,085
He put it in a drawer.
I'm gonna go get it.

1054
01:07:04,153 --> 01:07:07,179
You want me to wait here,
so Cheeco can bite me in my ass?

1055
01:07:07,256 --> 01:07:10,657
- Yeah!
- I'm goin'. I'm not doin' nothin'.

1056
01:07:10,726 --> 01:07:13,593
- What, man?
- I'm gonna tell you once more. Sit.

1057
01:07:13,662 --> 01:07:15,857
Get the finger outta my...

1058
01:07:28,844 --> 01:07:30,641
Damn.

1059
01:07:30,713 --> 01:07:32,146
Yea, yea.

1060
01:07:33,315 --> 01:07:36,614
You got that Ricky Martin CD?
I love him. He's a musical god.

1061
01:07:36,685 --> 01:07:42,521
He's good for my people.
Come on. All right. I wanna dance.

1062
01:07:42,591 --> 01:07:44,024
Damn.

1063
01:07:54,003 --> 01:07:55,971
Calm down.
I got something for you.

1064
01:07:56,038 --> 01:07:57,903
Got a treat.

1065
01:07:57,973 --> 01:08:01,704
You're gonna like this.
I got a little bud brownie.

1066
01:08:01,777 --> 01:08:04,268
Here. Just eat the whole thing.
Here. Just eat it all up.

1067
01:08:04,346 --> 01:08:06,678
Good boy. Eat it up.

1068
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:11,311
Eat it up. Eat it up.
Good dog. Good dog.

1069
01:08:16,158 --> 01:08:18,092
We're gonna party now.

1070
01:08:20,329 --> 01:08:22,320
What the fuck?

1071
01:08:22,398 --> 01:08:25,731
Hey, who locked
the fuckin' door, huh?

1072
01:08:25,801 --> 01:08:28,770
I don't like locked doors around here!
They make me crazy and shit!

1073
01:08:28,838 --> 01:08:32,205
I was locked up!
Pass the wire! Pass the wire!

1074
01:08:32,274 --> 01:08:35,471
I don't want no grilled cheese.
No, Leroy, I'm bilingual!

1075
01:08:35,544 --> 01:08:39,503
There's a difference.
No more locked doors!

1076
01:08:46,889 --> 01:08:48,914
No more locked doors around here,
you hear me?

1077
01:08:49,892 --> 01:08:53,419
What you been eating, girl?
Nothing but light beer for you.

1078
01:08:56,599 --> 01:08:58,157
I like it rough.

1079
01:08:58,234 --> 01:09:01,931
Oh, you do, huh? Good,
'cause that's how you're gonna get it.

1080
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:16,182
- What are you doing?
- Huh?

1081
01:09:16,252 --> 01:09:20,985
- What are you doing here?
- I hope you don't think I'm crazy.

1082
01:09:21,056 --> 01:09:24,025
I snuck in here to show you that
I wasn't scared of your punk brothers.

1083
01:09:24,093 --> 01:09:27,824
And if you had a man
like me in your life...

1084
01:09:27,897 --> 01:09:30,331
you wouldn't have to be
scared of them neither.

1085
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:33,391
What? So you snuck in my room
to tell me that?

1086
01:09:34,503 --> 01:09:35,868
Yeah, I did. Excuse me.

1087
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:40,968
- Who you talking to?
- Nobody!

1088
01:09:41,043 --> 01:09:44,843
- I heard a <i>vato's</i> voice in here.
- No, you didn't. Get out of my room.

1089
01:09:44,914 --> 01:09:47,382
Go back to your
stupid little girlfriends.

1090
01:09:47,449 --> 01:09:48,711
I'm telling Mom.

1091
01:09:48,784 --> 01:09:51,912
Good boy. Feel that?

1092
01:09:51,987 --> 01:09:55,013
Good dog. Lay down.

1093
01:09:55,090 --> 01:09:59,527
That's a good boy. Lay down.
Yeah, you're a good boy.

1094
01:10:01,263 --> 01:10:04,027
You are a good dog.

1095
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:07,364
Oh, I'm gonna do you good.

1096
01:10:07,436 --> 01:10:09,370
I'm gonna give it to you rough.

1097
01:10:09,438 --> 01:10:13,534
Here's Johnny.
I call him Mini Me.

1098
01:10:13,609 --> 01:10:17,272
I'm gonna do you like <i>American Me,</i>
baby. Don't look at me.

1099
01:10:17,346 --> 01:10:21,248
Don't look at me, little puppy.
Can I get a whoo, whoo?

1100
01:10:21,317 --> 01:10:23,842
I'm an Aztec warrior.

1101
01:10:27,756 --> 01:10:32,022
Bring your ass home, Craig.
Come on.

1102
01:10:32,094 --> 01:10:35,029
Hey, I'm cold.
I'll close the window.

1103
01:10:36,932 --> 01:10:38,365
Oh, shit.

1104
01:10:45,140 --> 01:10:49,042
Motherfuckers can't fuck with me.
I'm a player. I'm a player!

1105
01:10:50,045 --> 01:10:51,979
Like I was sayin'.

1106
01:10:54,350 --> 01:10:55,783
Are you listening?

1107
01:10:59,521 --> 01:11:01,580
We don't need this shit.

1108
01:11:01,657 --> 01:11:04,251
A guy like me
and a dog like you...

1109
01:11:04,326 --> 01:11:06,385
we ought to be in Maui...

1110
01:11:06,462 --> 01:11:09,727
rentin' Jet Skis to fat fucks
with flower shirts.

1111
01:11:16,038 --> 01:11:18,438
That'd be the good life.

1112
01:11:18,507 --> 01:11:23,740
Take you with me wherever I go.
I love you.

1113
01:11:23,812 --> 01:11:26,303
- It'll work.
- Come on.

1114
01:11:26,382 --> 01:11:28,350
- Where's Craig?
- He's in the house still.

1115
01:11:29,485 --> 01:11:31,476
- Why'd he go in the house?
- Don't worry about it.

1116
01:11:31,553 --> 01:11:33,919
We gotta figure out a way to get him
out of there. He's probably locked up.

1117
01:11:33,989 --> 01:11:37,083
- Come on.
- Shit.

1118
01:11:38,427 --> 01:11:42,454
- You did all this for me?
- Most of it.

1119
01:11:44,066 --> 01:11:46,466
I just hate to see a fine girl like you
in a situation like this.

1120
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:50,636
Thanks for noticing.

1121
01:11:50,706 --> 01:11:53,334
It used to be peaceful around here
before they got out.

1122
01:11:54,576 --> 01:11:57,875
They took over the house and
caused my mother's nervous breakdown.

1123
01:11:57,946 --> 01:12:01,177
Dang. Why she didn't
just kick 'em out?

1124
01:12:01,250 --> 01:12:03,684
We tried.

1125
01:12:03,752 --> 01:12:06,812
We saved up to get away from them,
but they just followed us.

1126
01:12:06,889 --> 01:12:10,882
Damn. I hate to hear that.
Can I get out this window right here?

1127
01:12:12,127 --> 01:12:15,995
- I thought you came up here to see me.
- I did. It's just, you know...

1128
01:12:16,065 --> 01:12:18,590
What's the hurry?

1129
01:12:18,667 --> 01:12:20,692
I got my cousin out here
waitin' on me.

1130
01:12:20,769 --> 01:12:23,237
So what?

1131
01:12:23,305 --> 01:12:25,239
Let's make him wait.

1132
01:12:28,477 --> 01:12:30,138
Okay, knock.

1133
01:12:30,212 --> 01:12:32,806
- You want me to knock?
- Knock!

1134
01:12:35,050 --> 01:12:37,746
You're actin' like a little bitch
right now, man.

1135
01:12:37,820 --> 01:12:39,981
They can't hear that.
The music's playin'.

1136
01:12:40,055 --> 01:12:43,115
Excuse me, partner. That was
a fuckin' ghetto knock I just did.

1137
01:12:43,192 --> 01:12:45,922
- I'll show you how to knock on a door.
- What ya doin'? Stop...

1138
01:12:45,994 --> 01:12:48,986
Yeah. Rub that shit.

1139
01:12:50,065 --> 01:12:51,999
I hear something.

1140
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:55,860
Fuck.

1141
01:12:55,938 --> 01:12:58,236
I can't do anything
around here! Shit!

1142
01:12:59,908 --> 01:13:01,500
Ruining my flow.

1143
01:13:02,678 --> 01:13:04,612
Right there.

1144
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:06,511
Lover boys, you hear that shit?

1145
01:13:07,282 --> 01:13:09,250
You better stop.

1146
01:13:09,318 --> 01:13:12,082
- They gonna think we're the police!
- It gets results.

1147
01:13:13,355 --> 01:13:14,617
What do you want?

1148
01:13:15,691 --> 01:13:17,283
We came to borrow some sugar.

1149
01:13:18,594 --> 01:13:20,960
Does this look like
a fuckin' 7-Eleven to you?

1150
01:13:21,029 --> 01:13:23,020
Do you see that red dot
on my forehead?

1151
01:13:23,098 --> 01:13:25,896
Do you see an ATM in the corner
that doesn't work?

1152
01:13:25,968 --> 01:13:28,801
Do you? No, you don't,
so fuck you, my friend.

1153
01:13:28,871 --> 01:13:30,736
Get the fuck outta here.

1154
01:13:30,806 --> 01:13:32,103
You too, Slim Shady.

1155
01:13:32,174 --> 01:13:35,940
- No problem. We gone.
- Hold on a second.

1156
01:13:36,011 --> 01:13:40,744
Hey, man, you ran over my skateboard.
I don't appreciate that, all right?

1157
01:13:41,784 --> 01:13:43,911
That's bullshit, man. It ain't...

1158
01:14:01,470 --> 01:14:02,801
Got your message.
Where's Craig?

1159
01:14:03,572 --> 01:14:05,904
Message? I ain't sent you
no damn message!

1160
01:14:05,974 --> 01:14:07,839
You didn't call the sandwich joint
with an urgent message?

1161
01:14:07,910 --> 01:14:11,812
Hell, no, Willie!
You startin' to think like a dog.

1162
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:14,314
Believe them fleas and ticks
suckin' on your old-ass brain.

1163
01:14:14,383 --> 01:14:16,248
Somebody sent me a message.
Where's Craig and Day-Day?

1164
01:14:16,318 --> 01:14:18,582
I don't know.

1165
01:14:18,654 --> 01:14:20,588
Come on in.

1166
01:14:22,658 --> 01:14:26,025
You know you got shit
all over the back of your ass?

1167
01:14:26,094 --> 01:14:29,621
Don't sit on that couch!
Put some paper down.

1168
01:14:29,698 --> 01:14:31,598
Next time page me first.

1169
01:14:31,667 --> 01:14:34,329
Okay, I'll do that.
What's my code, 69?

1170
01:14:34,403 --> 01:14:37,600
- No, 68.
- Yeah, right.

1171
01:14:37,673 --> 01:14:38,605
Shit.

1172
01:14:41,710 --> 01:14:43,337
You okay?

1173
01:14:49,017 --> 01:14:52,145
This is some bullshit. We just
came over here to borrow some sugar.

1174
01:14:52,221 --> 01:14:55,281
- And some Phillies.
- And some Phillies and...

1175
01:14:55,357 --> 01:14:58,349
We ain't come to fuck up
y'all little ménage à trois.

1176
01:14:58,427 --> 01:15:02,591
These are some bad bitches y'all got
over here and we would not fuck that up.

1177
01:15:02,664 --> 01:15:05,292
- How y'all doin' anyway?
- Fine.

1178
01:15:05,367 --> 01:15:06,334
Hey!

1179
01:15:06,401 --> 01:15:08,596
My name is Day-Day.
I'm your local neighborhood player.

1180
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:10,797
This is my little buddy Roach.
Roach, say, "What's happenin'?" to them.

1181
01:15:10,873 --> 01:15:13,137
- Nice to meet you ladies.
- Hey, hey!

1182
01:15:13,208 --> 01:15:14,539
What the fuck?

1183
01:15:15,911 --> 01:15:18,243
This isn't <i>The Love Connection.</i>

1184
01:15:18,313 --> 01:15:21,680
Trying to pick up on our <i>hynas</i> or what,
eh? Want to go to the room right now?

1185
01:15:23,051 --> 01:15:26,214
I don't know about you two.
I don't know about this sugar shit.

1186
01:15:26,288 --> 01:15:28,347
I know black people got a lot
of sugar in their house.

1187
01:15:29,191 --> 01:15:31,386
So I don't know.
You makin' me susp...

1188
01:15:33,428 --> 01:15:36,522
- Suspicious, eh?
- It's makin' me think a lot! Smart guy.

1189
01:15:39,568 --> 01:15:42,401
He's tryin' to make it
with our chicks.

1190
01:15:45,741 --> 01:15:47,675
- What'd he say?
- I don't know.

1191
01:15:47,743 --> 01:15:49,802
Karla's coming down.
Give me the weapon.

1192
01:15:51,013 --> 01:15:54,414
- Shut the fuck up and act natural.
- No problem.

1193
01:15:57,953 --> 01:16:00,683
- Hey. What's goin' on?
- Nothing.

1194
01:16:03,458 --> 01:16:05,756
Are you going to give me
a ride to see Mommy?

1195
01:16:05,827 --> 01:16:09,354
Dang! You bug! Look,
just take my car, all right?

1196
01:16:09,431 --> 01:16:12,059
- Take your car?
- Did I stutter?

1197
01:16:12,134 --> 01:16:15,228
- Did I stutter?
- Hell, no. You ain't...

1198
01:16:15,304 --> 01:16:17,738
Shut up, stupid.
Just give me your car keys.

1199
01:16:17,806 --> 01:16:20,036
- I'm not stupid. You're stupid.
- You're stupid.

1200
01:16:20,108 --> 01:16:22,099
- Don't call me stupid. I'm sensitive.
- Where's the car keys?

1201
01:16:22,177 --> 01:16:24,702
- You're stupid!
- I'll be back in a bit. Bye.

1202
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:26,441
- Chickenhead.
- Stupid ass.

1203
01:16:26,515 --> 01:16:28,574
Don't be hittin' my switches too.

1204
01:16:28,650 --> 01:16:31,050
And tell Mama we miss her cooking.

1205
01:16:32,521 --> 01:16:36,389
You know what? If everything's cool,
then we'll let you bounce too.

1206
01:16:36,458 --> 01:16:39,825
That's a deal.
That's what I'm talkin' about.

1207
01:16:51,039 --> 01:16:53,769
- Where the hell you been?
- I was over...

1208
01:16:53,842 --> 01:16:56,106
This is my boy.
I'm the only one who can yell at him.

1209
01:16:56,178 --> 01:16:59,147
- Where the hell you been?
- Have y'all seen Day-Day?

1210
01:16:59,214 --> 01:17:02,411
Thought he was with you.

1211
01:17:02,484 --> 01:17:06,181
I knew we'd never be together forever.
You're a cold little Puerto Rican dude.

1212
01:17:12,761 --> 01:17:15,286
- What?
- We're saying you're fucked!

1213
01:17:15,364 --> 01:17:17,423
- You're staying with us.
- Oh, man.

1214
01:17:17,499 --> 01:17:20,400
Baby Joker, get the duct tape.

1215
01:17:22,070 --> 01:17:23,799
It's on my bed.
I was using it earlier.

1216
01:17:23,872 --> 01:17:27,808
- Shit, man!
- And, you, put your clothes back on.

1217
01:17:32,047 --> 01:17:34,845
Come on. The party's over.
Get your chickie heads outta here!

1218
01:17:34,916 --> 01:17:39,080
Come on! Move it, hood-rat. Get your ass
outta here. Bus leaves at 11:00!

1219
01:17:39,154 --> 01:17:41,418
Take this shit with you!

1220
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:42,787
Call me!

1221
01:17:43,659 --> 01:17:46,389
- What a jerk.
- He's stupid.

1222
01:17:46,461 --> 01:17:48,395
- What did we do?
- Why does he need tape?

1223
01:17:48,463 --> 01:17:52,126
- Tell us what we did.
- You're fucked. Gonna have a party.

1224
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:55,294
- What kind of party?
- A prison party. We just got out.

1225
01:17:55,370 --> 01:17:58,305
I know what to do with you.

1226
01:17:58,373 --> 01:18:00,000
- Shit!
- He's cute, huh?

1227
01:18:00,075 --> 01:18:02,043
- I want the little one.
- He's like a Frosted Mini-Wheat.

1228
01:18:02,110 --> 01:18:03,873
Hold on, baby.

1229
01:18:03,945 --> 01:18:06,880
- It's gonna be crazy.
- Don't do that.

1230
01:18:06,948 --> 01:18:08,745
You haven't seen my Aztec warrior.

1231
01:18:08,817 --> 01:18:11,911
- I can't handle this!
- You can't handle them?

1232
01:18:11,987 --> 01:18:15,423
- You can handle them.
- You got a pretty mouth.

1233
01:18:15,490 --> 01:18:16,923
Don't do that!

1234
01:18:16,992 --> 01:18:18,687
<i>Don't do it.</i>

1235
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:20,694
- You think they in there?
- They in there.

1236
01:18:20,762 --> 01:18:22,491
We got to do something.

1237
01:18:22,564 --> 01:18:24,759
Y'all take your asses over there
if you want to.

1238
01:18:24,833 --> 01:18:29,566
If you ain't back in ten minutes, I'm
callin' the police and insurance man.

1239
01:18:29,638 --> 01:18:32,869
Wait a minute.
I'm goin' to get my shit.

1240
01:18:34,976 --> 01:18:37,444
<i>How many of us have them</i>

1241
01:18:37,512 --> 01:18:39,946
<i>Friends</i>

1242
01:18:40,015 --> 01:18:42,040
<i>Ones we can depend on</i>

1243
01:18:42,117 --> 01:18:44,051
<i>Friends</i>

1244
01:18:44,119 --> 01:18:46,679
Shut the fuck up!

1245
01:18:48,790 --> 01:18:51,258
I don't even like Whodini.

1246
01:18:51,326 --> 01:18:55,285
We can be friends as soon as
you tell me where my money is.

1247
01:18:55,363 --> 01:18:59,129
Money? We came to borrow sugar from ya
and some rollin' papers.

1248
01:18:59,201 --> 01:19:02,864
We wanted to get high. I was gonna show
this white boy how to make Kool-Aid...

1249
01:19:03,972 --> 01:19:05,633
Shit!

1250
01:19:05,707 --> 01:19:08,039
Just have a heart, Mr. Joker.
Please. It's Friday!

1251
01:19:08,110 --> 01:19:11,705
- I know what fuckin' day it is.
- Oh, shit! Fuck.

1252
01:19:11,780 --> 01:19:15,307
I hear a lot of talking,
but the words don't mean shit.

1253
01:19:19,187 --> 01:19:21,246
Maybe that other <i>chanate</i> took it.
Remember him?

1254
01:19:23,992 --> 01:19:29,123
Hey, Day-Day,
where is your other <i>mayate?</i>

1255
01:19:49,785 --> 01:19:52,151
It's a nice piece of heat
you got there.

1256
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:54,950
Thank you. I ain't got but
two bullets in the motherfucker.

1257
01:19:55,023 --> 01:19:57,457
- But that's better than nothin'.
- Yeah, it is.

1258
01:19:57,526 --> 01:20:00,427
Two bullets? Boy, your ass
ain't changed at all.

1259
01:20:00,495 --> 01:20:03,157
Back in the day,
only thing I had was a stick.

1260
01:20:03,231 --> 01:20:06,166
You missed with your stick. I ain't
gonna miss with these two bullets.

1261
01:20:06,234 --> 01:20:08,600
Hey, y'all. Not now. Come on.

1262
01:20:17,512 --> 01:20:20,504
- Come on. You know what to do.
- Shit!

1263
01:20:24,586 --> 01:20:26,520
That's Versace you steppin' on.

1264
01:20:26,588 --> 01:20:29,056
Versace?
You can't even spell Versace.

1265
01:20:29,124 --> 01:20:33,891
"Fo-satchy." F-O... satchy.

1266
01:20:50,245 --> 01:20:51,576
Damn.

1267
01:20:51,646 --> 01:20:53,580
You all right?

1268
01:20:55,250 --> 01:20:58,048
- Yeah.
- Will you be quiet, Tarzan?

1269
01:20:58,119 --> 01:21:00,587
I don't do this shit every day.

1270
01:21:02,224 --> 01:21:06,490
I'm tellin' you, man.
You can do a lot for this community...

1271
01:21:06,561 --> 01:21:09,928
Shut up!
I'm sick of bullshitting with you two.

1272
01:21:09,998 --> 01:21:11,329
Baby Joker?

1273
01:21:19,374 --> 01:21:21,035
- Little Joker?
- Yeah.

1274
01:21:21,109 --> 01:21:22,440
Tape their mouths shut.

1275
01:21:23,845 --> 01:21:25,779
I don't wanna hear
a grown man scream.

1276
01:21:36,124 --> 01:21:37,785
Shit.

1277
01:21:37,859 --> 01:21:39,292
What, man?

1278
01:21:39,361 --> 01:21:41,886
We must be here. We stopped.

1279
01:21:41,963 --> 01:21:45,797
Good. Let's get the hell outta here.
It stink in here.

1280
01:21:45,867 --> 01:21:49,132
- How do we get out?
- How am I supposed to know?

1281
01:21:49,204 --> 01:21:52,298
You the one with all the muscle.
Why don't you get us outta here?

1282
01:21:52,374 --> 01:21:53,739
Raise your hand, fool.

1283
01:21:54,876 --> 01:21:58,744
Now let me show you
how we gonna do this.

1284
01:22:26,274 --> 01:22:30,233
Come on, man! Let me outta here!
Come on, man! I'm your brother!

1285
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:34,647
Come on! Don't do this
to your own brother, man!

1286
01:22:34,716 --> 01:22:36,013
Get out, fool.

1287
01:22:55,036 --> 01:22:56,298
Damn.

1288
01:22:59,307 --> 01:23:02,299
Hey, young man.

1289
01:23:02,377 --> 01:23:05,369
You got knocked the fuck out.

1290
01:23:05,447 --> 01:23:08,280
No more fun and games.

1291
01:23:08,350 --> 01:23:11,183
My little <i>carnal,</i>
he went to get my chain saw.

1292
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:15,289
I'm gonna show you what happens
to <i>putos</i> that take my money...

1293
01:23:15,357 --> 01:23:17,484
and don't tell me
what I wanna hear.

1294
01:23:19,327 --> 01:23:21,625
Ever see <i>Scarface,</i> fuckers?

1295
01:23:26,568 --> 01:23:28,559
Go see what's takin' him so long.

1296
01:23:34,542 --> 01:23:35,975
Junior?

1297
01:23:37,612 --> 01:23:39,011
Junior?

1298
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:41,014
What the fuck, stupid?

1299
01:23:46,721 --> 01:23:48,348
My back!

1300
01:23:49,357 --> 01:23:53,225
- What's the matter?
- I believe I slipped my disk again.

1301
01:23:53,294 --> 01:23:55,922
Goddamn!

1302
01:23:55,997 --> 01:23:58,192
- Let me help you.
- Don't touch me!

1303
01:23:59,334 --> 01:24:02,667
Ain't nothin' wrong with you.
Get your big ass up.

1304
01:24:02,737 --> 01:24:05,069
I'll tie this boy up myself.

1305
01:24:05,140 --> 01:24:07,335
I should tie your big ass up, too,
and drag you down the street.

1306
01:24:11,146 --> 01:24:13,876
You players are going
on the disabled list...

1307
01:24:15,183 --> 01:24:17,151
as soon as my brothers
get back here.

1308
01:24:22,323 --> 01:24:24,348
They should be back here
any minute now.

1309
01:24:26,361 --> 01:24:28,852
They'll be back soon.

1310
01:24:31,099 --> 01:24:33,329
Fuck! Where are these fuckers?

1311
01:24:33,401 --> 01:24:36,802
I gotta do everything. It's tough
being the brains of the operation.

1312
01:24:37,639 --> 01:24:38,833
Fuck!

1313
01:24:38,907 --> 01:24:41,808
Hey! You <i>putos</i> go?

1314
01:24:41,876 --> 01:24:45,437
You gonna make me crazy!
You make me crazy! Come on!

1315
01:24:45,513 --> 01:24:48,539
- Makin' me look like a punk!
- It slipped!

1316
01:24:48,616 --> 01:24:52,313
- My disk slipped again in my back.
- What the fuck?

1317
01:24:56,458 --> 01:24:58,517
What the hell are you doing here?

1318
01:24:58,593 --> 01:25:01,426
I lost something.
What it look like, fool?

1319
01:25:01,496 --> 01:25:03,430
It looks like a dead <i>mayate</i>
with a loud shirt.

1320
01:25:03,498 --> 01:25:06,592
My mind! That's what I lost.
Ain't this my yard?

1321
01:25:09,404 --> 01:25:11,065
Get up!

1322
01:25:12,574 --> 01:25:15,509
Watch his feet.
Watch his feet, boy.

1323
01:25:16,978 --> 01:25:18,070
Fucker!

1324
01:25:48,977 --> 01:25:50,501
School's in, bitch.

1325
01:25:51,312 --> 01:25:52,540
Motherfucker.

1326
01:25:52,614 --> 01:25:54,639
I got your ass right here.

1327
01:25:55,683 --> 01:26:00,620
I'm gonna kick your ass for gettin' me
into this mess, throwin' my back out.

1328
01:26:01,456 --> 01:26:04,289
Daddy, it ain't my fault!
I'm not bullshittin'.

1329
01:26:04,359 --> 01:26:07,920
I was hangin' with this white boy,
and he got me into all kinds of shi...

1330
01:26:15,370 --> 01:26:16,462
Damn!

1331
01:26:16,538 --> 01:26:17,835
What's up?

1332
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:20,537
Help!

1333
01:26:22,977 --> 01:26:24,501
Shit!

1334
01:26:24,579 --> 01:26:26,046
Get up!

1335
01:26:29,918 --> 01:26:33,012
Say hello to my little friend.

1336
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:42,828
Yeah, that's it! I'm gonna blast
this fool. Give me that gun.

1337
01:26:42,897 --> 01:26:46,890
- Here!
- Come on, fool. Remember me, punk?

1338
01:26:47,569 --> 01:26:48,900
Lord, have mercy.

1339
01:27:08,790 --> 01:27:11,623
What you want me to do?
Bad dog!

1340
01:27:12,594 --> 01:27:13,925
- Freeze!
- Hands up!

1341
01:27:13,995 --> 01:27:16,520
Two giant Milk Duds.

1342
01:27:17,265 --> 01:27:19,358
Freeze! Sheriff's Department!

1343
01:27:19,434 --> 01:27:20,958
I live across the street!

1344
01:27:21,703 --> 01:27:24,866
Paid cash! They the ones you want!

1345
01:27:24,939 --> 01:27:28,272
- Problem, officers?
- Don't move!

1346
01:27:28,343 --> 01:27:30,971
- Make a damn hole!
- Hey, brother, man!

1347
01:27:31,045 --> 01:27:33,445
Y'all can't fuck with the police.

1348
01:27:33,514 --> 01:27:36,039
Y'all can't fuck with the police.

1349
01:27:39,387 --> 01:27:43,517
Rude-ass cops.
You done paid your parking tickets?

1350
01:27:43,591 --> 01:27:45,616
You still got your illegal cable?

1351
01:27:45,693 --> 01:27:48,218
We better get the hell outta here.

1352
01:27:48,296 --> 01:27:51,823
- Come here, Cheeco!
- Get your hands off me!

1353
01:27:51,899 --> 01:27:56,336
- This is like a bad dream.
- Why you cops got to be so violent?

1354
01:27:58,873 --> 01:28:00,670
I love Fridays.

1355
01:28:01,976 --> 01:28:04,843
It ain't over, punk!
Wait till I get out!

1356
01:28:07,882 --> 01:28:10,578
- When you get out?
- I'm gonna beat your butt up too.

1357
01:28:12,687 --> 01:28:14,621
- It ain't over!
- Come on, man!

1358
01:28:14,689 --> 01:28:18,455
- Good job. Good job.
- Yeah, that's our pump!

1359
01:28:18,526 --> 01:28:20,255
Shut up!

1360
01:28:21,329 --> 01:28:23,524
That's right.

1361
01:28:23,598 --> 01:28:25,532
Look what I got.

1362
01:28:26,801 --> 01:28:28,769
Wait, man. Don't open that here.

1363
01:28:32,740 --> 01:28:34,935
- Jump up and down on that back of his.
- That's next.

1364
01:28:35,009 --> 01:28:36,704
Don't listen to him.

1365
01:28:36,778 --> 01:28:40,839
Cash make the coochie go whoo-whoo.

1366
01:28:40,915 --> 01:28:45,352
It's gonna feel real good
to pay my taxes. Thanks, nephew.

1367
01:28:45,420 --> 01:28:47,320
No problem, Unc.

1368
01:28:49,190 --> 01:28:51,317
All done!

1369
01:28:51,392 --> 01:28:53,622
Thanks, Miss Kym.

1370
01:28:53,695 --> 01:28:56,425
- Call me, man.
- All right.

1371
01:29:01,069 --> 01:29:03,333
Ancient Chinese secret.

1372
01:29:03,404 --> 01:29:05,929
I'm Korean, motherfucker.

1373
01:29:06,007 --> 01:29:09,636
Fat-ass little Chinese lady's gonna
take the money and not give me no play?

1374
01:29:11,079 --> 01:29:13,639
Will you get your broke-down ass up?

1375
01:29:13,715 --> 01:29:16,149
There ain't nothin' wrong with you.
Layin' down like a broke-dick dog.

1376
01:29:16,217 --> 01:29:19,209
Get up. Come on.
What's wrong with you?

1377
01:29:21,022 --> 01:29:24,014
Damn! That
George Jefferson shit works!

1378
01:29:24,092 --> 01:29:25,354
Walk me to the door.

1379
01:29:27,195 --> 01:29:30,130
Hey. Wait a minute.

1380
01:29:30,198 --> 01:29:32,598
I'm sure gonna miss you.

1381
01:29:32,667 --> 01:29:35,192
Why don't you give
your Auntie Suga some sugar?

1382
01:29:36,070 --> 01:29:37,560
Give me a kiss.

1383
01:29:39,674 --> 01:29:41,403
- Hey!
- Come here.

1384
01:29:44,979 --> 01:29:46,412
Sorry.

1385
01:29:51,853 --> 01:29:54,253
Nephew, you're welcome here anytime.

1386
01:29:56,657 --> 01:29:58,887
Thanks again.

1387
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:02,794
She's always hittin' on somebody.
Man, you sure you don't wanna stay?

1388
01:30:02,864 --> 01:30:06,925
You know I got to live ghetto fabulous.
I can't stay here with y'all fools.

1389
01:30:07,001 --> 01:30:10,266
- It's too crazy around here.
- Yeah, it's thugged out.

1390
01:30:10,338 --> 01:30:12,465
But you keep that car.
You make sure you get that fixed.

1391
01:30:12,540 --> 01:30:15,100
- You know that. I got money now.
- Yeah, I see.

1392
01:30:15,176 --> 01:30:17,110
When can I come to see you
and fuck your neighborhood up?

1393
01:30:17,178 --> 01:30:19,146
- You can't.
- All right.

1394
01:30:25,286 --> 01:30:29,222
Fuck his shit up.
Go on, girl. Hurry up.

1395

Get that shit.

Hurry up!

1397
01:30:39,634 --> 01:30:44,094
<i>Oh, well. All is well</i>
<i>that ends well, of course.</i>

1398
01:30:44,172 --> 01:30:47,403
<i>Another Friday gone,</i>
<i>another problem solved.</i>

1399
01:30:48,309 --> 01:30:52,245
<i>It's a trip to know that things</i>
<i>can get wild in the suburbs too.</i>

1400
01:30:52,313 --> 01:30:55,146
<i>Man, I can't wait</i>
<i>to get back home...</i>

1401
01:30:55,216 --> 01:30:58,185
<i>to the peace and</i>
