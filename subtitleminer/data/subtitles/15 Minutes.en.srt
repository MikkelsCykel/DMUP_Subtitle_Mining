Next, please.

Next in line, please.

3
00:01:27,247 --> 00:01:29,215  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Next, please. Next.

4
00:01:30,783 --> 00:01:34,082  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
How you doing?
Can I see your documents?

5
00:01:34,154 --> 00:01:36,850  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
What's the purpose of your visit
to the United States today?

6
00:01:36,923 --> 00:01:38,185  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Two weeks holiday.

7
00:01:38,258 --> 00:01:40,158  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Do you have
a return-trip ticket?

8
00:01:40,226 --> 00:01:42,888  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Excuse me. No photography
in the F.I.S. area.

9
00:01:42,962 --> 00:01:45,192  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Is he traveling with you?

10
00:01:45,265 --> 00:01:47,130  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Are you two together?

11
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,634  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Sir, why don't you come on up?
Join us.

12
00:01:51,304 --> 00:01:52,703  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Is there a problem?

13
00:01:52,772 --> 00:01:55,866  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
No, but if you're together,
I want to talk to you together.

14
00:01:55,942 --> 00:01:57,603  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Can I see your documents?
-Sure.

15
00:01:57,677 --> 00:02:00,043  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Passport, please.

16
00:02:00,113 --> 00:02:01,205  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Are you related?

17
00:02:01,281 --> 00:02:03,340  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Yes. He's my friend.

18
00:02:06,786 --> 00:02:10,449  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
You're a Czech national.
You're a Russian national.

19
00:02:10,523 --> 00:02:14,357  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-How do you know one another?
-We know each other from Prague.

20
00:02:14,427 --> 00:02:16,418  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
How long are you
planning to stay?

21
00:02:16,496 --> 00:02:17,758  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Two weeks.

22
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,821  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I'd like him
to answer for himself.

23
00:02:19,899 --> 00:02:21,730  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
He doesn't speak English.

24
00:02:21,801 --> 00:02:24,531  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
No, sir.
I speak very good English.

25
00:02:25,705 --> 00:02:28,435  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I'm here for movies.

26
00:02:28,508 --> 00:02:31,068  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
For movies?
I don't understand.

27
00:02:31,144 --> 00:02:33,044  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
When I was a boy...

28
00:02:33,112 --> 00:02:37,913  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I've seen at my school movie
called "It's Wonderful Life"...

29
00:02:37,984 --> 00:02:40,043  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
directed by Frank Capra.

30
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:43,680  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Ever since, I want to come
to United States...

31
00:02:43,756 --> 00:02:46,520  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Iand of the free,
home of the brave...

32
00:02:46,593 --> 00:02:48,618  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
country where anyone
can be anything.

33
00:02:49,195 --> 00:02:51,026  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Bullshit!

34
00:02:51,097 --> 00:02:52,860  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
"Abandoned Baby
in Times Square."

35
00:02:52,932 --> 00:02:54,991  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Come on,
it's too fucking soft.

36
00:02:55,068 --> 00:02:58,367  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
It won't work,
and it won't get the numbers.

37
00:02:58,438 --> 00:03:01,100  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
What are you suggesting, Robert,
we manufacture bad news?

38
00:03:01,174 --> 00:03:03,233  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
It's what they tune us in for.

39
00:03:03,309 --> 00:03:05,436  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
We're a tabloid show.
They tune in for rough stuff.

40
00:03:05,511 --> 00:03:08,173  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
The network's up my pretty
little ass to make a change.

41
00:03:08,248 --> 00:03:10,216  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Every lobbyist, mom,
and politician...

42
00:03:10,283 --> 00:03:12,376  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
is screaming about violence
in prime time.

43
00:03:12,452 --> 00:03:14,147  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
We've got to broaden the format.

44
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,312  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
You broaden the format.

45
00:03:15,388 --> 00:03:18,186  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
In the end, they'll run
the story with the juice.

46
00:03:18,258 --> 00:03:20,089  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
They want ratings
as much as I do.

47
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,558  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
If it bleeds, it leads.

48
00:03:21,628 --> 00:03:24,188  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-What do you got for me?
-Ride-along with Eddie Flemming.

49
00:03:24,264 --> 00:03:25,390  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Fuck, again?!

50
00:03:25,465 --> 00:03:27,160  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
On the cover of "People"
this week.

51
00:03:27,233 --> 00:03:28,495  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
He is not new.

52
00:03:28,568 --> 00:03:30,433  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I love Eddie,
he's a dear friend...

53
00:03:30,503 --> 00:03:31,765  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
but we've done him to death.

54
00:03:31,838 --> 00:03:33,032  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
No, this is very good.

55
00:03:33,106 --> 00:03:34,596  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
The psychiatrist
is going to trial tomorrow.

56
00:03:34,674 --> 00:03:35,902  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
The ratings'll
be through the roof.

57
00:03:35,975 --> 00:03:37,306  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
What's Eddie working on?

58
00:03:37,377 --> 00:03:39,174  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Staking out
a Jamaican serial killer.

59
00:03:39,245 --> 00:03:40,371  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
That sounds good.

60
00:03:40,446 --> 00:03:42,539  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I don't want
just blood and guts!

61
00:03:42,615 --> 00:03:43,980  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I want to broaden the format!

62
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,915  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I know they brought you in here
to raise our standards...

63
00:03:45,985 --> 00:03:47,077  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
to be the journalism cop--

64
00:03:47,153 --> 00:03:49,485  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Excuse me!
-You're killing my show!

65
00:03:49,555 --> 00:03:52,524  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Don't forget,
Eddie's always good TV.

66
00:03:52,592 --> 00:03:54,253  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Not when he's drunk.

67
00:03:54,327 --> 00:03:56,352  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
He's got a new cure for that.

68
00:04:50,316 --> 00:04:51,908  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
When?

69
00:04:51,984 --> 00:04:53,747  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Tomorrow at lunch.

70
00:05:03,429 --> 00:05:04,623  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Ready, set.

71
00:05:07,233 --> 00:05:08,928  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Let's go.

72
00:05:11,471 --> 00:05:12,961  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Thrill of the hunt.

73
00:05:24,283 --> 00:05:25,841  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Girls, girls, girls!

74
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:28,409  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I am the resurrection
and the light!

75
00:05:30,456 --> 00:05:32,321  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Check it out.

76
00:05:44,504 --> 00:05:45,698  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Taxi!

77
00:06:19,005 --> 00:06:21,633  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
"Fuji color.

78
00:06:21,707 --> 00:06:24,801  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
"Adjustable shutter speed.

79
00:06:24,877 --> 00:06:28,369  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
"Night vision. Infrared.

80
00:06:28,448 --> 00:06:29,847  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
"Black and white.

81
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:33,147  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
"Make your own movies."

82
00:06:43,796 --> 00:06:45,957  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Damn !
Watch where you're going!

83
00:06:51,571 --> 00:06:53,334  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Where'd that big guy go
with the video?

84
00:06:53,406 --> 00:06:55,397  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
He stole my camera!
Stop that guy!

85
00:06:55,475 --> 00:06:58,000  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Go!
-Stop that guy in the cab!

86
00:06:58,411 --> 00:07:00,971  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Bryan, we're pulling up now.
This is important.

87
00:07:01,047 --> 00:07:03,345  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I need fresh footage
for the piece on Eddie.

88
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:07,182  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
You come in fast on my signal
with the camera rolling.

89
00:07:14,694 --> 00:07:16,594  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
So, what's unique?

90
00:07:16,662 --> 00:07:19,256  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Not what, who.
From Jamaica.

91
00:07:19,332 --> 00:07:22,301  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
His girlfriend took too long
putting her makeup on.

92
00:07:22,368 --> 00:07:24,461  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
They were late for a party.

93
00:07:24,537 --> 00:07:27,472  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-He stabbed her with a bottle.
-Jesus Christ.

94
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,337  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
That's unique, all right.
Shit.

95
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:31,603  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
He still went to the party.

96
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,375  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Top floor, back room.

97
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:38,144  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Eddie, autograph, mon.

98
00:07:38,217 --> 00:07:40,048  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Phone number.

99
00:07:40,119 --> 00:07:42,087  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Why your picture not on this?

100
00:07:42,154 --> 00:07:43,815  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Bounce.
-All right.

101
00:07:45,558 --> 00:07:48,049  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Yo, Unique.
Five-O's on the way, bro.

102
00:07:48,127 --> 00:07:49,492  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Cops? Yeah, mon.

103
00:07:49,562 --> 00:07:51,553  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Let's go.
-Love you, too, man.

104
00:07:51,631 --> 00:07:53,963  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Who does he think Leon was?
-It won't matter.

105
00:07:54,033 --> 00:07:56,900  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
He'll hear the cops are coming
and just get out of there.

106
00:07:56,969 --> 00:07:58,163  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Come on. Be quiet.

107
00:07:58,237 --> 00:07:59,670  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Right. Stand by.

108
00:07:59,739 --> 00:08:01,570  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Standing by.

109
00:08:01,641 --> 00:08:03,302  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
You going to be home tonight?

110
00:08:03,376 --> 00:08:05,401  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
We're running the Geller piece.
You're on it.

111
00:08:05,478 --> 00:08:07,639  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
You ran that thing
a thousand times already.

112
00:08:07,713 --> 00:08:09,305  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
So what?
He's going to court tomorrow.

113
00:08:09,382 --> 00:08:11,077  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
The psychiatrist's trial
is starting.

114
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:12,378  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Ratings will be
through the roof.

115
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,755  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Get out. Get out. Get out.

116
00:08:21,327 --> 00:08:23,318  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Do me a favor.
Cut my interview out.

117
00:08:23,396 --> 00:08:24,988  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
What for? Jesus Christ.

118
00:08:25,064 --> 00:08:27,897  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
You getting shit from downtown?
Fuck 'em.

119
00:08:27,967 --> 00:08:29,867  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
You're the only one
making big cases in this town.

120
00:08:29,936 --> 00:08:33,099  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I bring the big cases,
that brings the big news.

121
00:08:33,172 --> 00:08:35,333  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
That stuff hurts
as much as it helps.

122
00:08:35,408 --> 00:08:37,706  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Get real jealous downtown.

123
00:08:37,777 --> 00:08:40,302  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Stay behind me.

124
00:08:40,379 --> 00:08:43,109  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Hope this fuck don't run.
My knees are killing me.

125
00:08:43,182 --> 00:08:45,116  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Be quiet. Get back.

126
00:08:45,184 --> 00:08:48,085  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
You're worried about my safety?
I'm touched.

127
00:08:49,755 --> 00:08:51,552  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Go! Get away!

128
00:08:51,624 --> 00:08:53,819  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Just keep them out of my way.
-Right.

129
00:08:53,893 --> 00:08:55,861  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-You ready?
-Yes, Robert, we're ready.

130
00:08:55,928 --> 00:08:57,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-You ready?
-I'm ready.

131
00:08:57,229 --> 00:08:58,560  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
OK. Let's go.

132
00:08:58,631 --> 00:09:01,566  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Just get out!

133
00:09:05,104 --> 00:09:07,732  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Come on, you fucking guys!
Come in rolling!

134
00:09:07,807 --> 00:09:09,798  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
What's your rush?
Going to a party?

135
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,740  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
What you chase me for?

136
00:09:11,811 --> 00:09:14,211  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
You always leave your house
like that?

137
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,043  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
This not my bloody house!

138
00:09:16,115 --> 00:09:18,743  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-You live here, or you don't?
-Me don't live here!

139
00:09:18,818 --> 00:09:20,809  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
That sounds like burglary
to me, pal.

140
00:09:20,886 --> 00:09:22,786  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Any chance
we could get that again?

141
00:09:22,855 --> 00:09:25,187  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I didn't want to do it
in the first place.

142
00:09:26,993 --> 00:09:28,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Are you fucking kidding me?

143
00:09:28,828 --> 00:09:30,762  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Turn that fucking thing off!
Are you out of your mind?!

144
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,320  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Jesus Christ,
where the hell were you?

145
00:09:32,398 --> 00:09:36,061  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
You two are a waste
of my goddamn life! Fuck!

146
00:09:50,716 --> 00:09:52,581  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
No, Emil, get the position.

147
00:09:52,652 --> 00:09:53,744  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
What?

148
00:09:53,819 --> 00:09:56,014  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
First scene of my new movie.

149
00:09:56,088 --> 00:09:59,114  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Collecting our share
from the bank job.

150
00:09:59,191 --> 00:10:02,024  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
And action.

151
00:10:05,464 --> 00:10:06,863  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Just a moment!

152
00:10:10,836 --> 00:10:12,326  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
It's Emil.

153
00:10:25,051 --> 00:10:27,485  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Kalinka

154
00:10:27,553 --> 00:10:29,077  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Kalinka

155
00:10:29,155 --> 00:10:31,350  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Kalinka, hey!

156
00:10:31,424 --> 00:10:32,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Kalinka

157
00:10:32,591 --> 00:10:35,321  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Kalinka, Kalinka

158
00:10:35,394 --> 00:10:36,554  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Hey

159
00:10:40,099 --> 00:10:41,532  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
How are you?

160
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:06,422  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Beautiful necklace.

161
00:11:20,673 --> 00:11:23,506  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Emil, it wasn't my fault
you two got caught.

162
00:11:23,576 --> 00:11:25,043  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I know.

163
00:11:25,111 --> 00:11:28,774  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Please, it's his fault.
It's really his fault.

164
00:11:28,848 --> 00:11:30,782  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Trying to get the bank clerk's
phone number.

165
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:31,817  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
How could I wait?

166
00:11:41,327 --> 00:11:43,261  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Let's forget all this shit!

167
00:11:45,064 --> 00:11:47,225  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Hang on. Calm down.

168
00:11:47,299 --> 00:11:49,995  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Calm down.

169
00:11:51,036 --> 00:11:52,333  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
You know what?

170
00:11:54,473 --> 00:11:57,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Give me my money.

171
00:11:59,378 --> 00:12:03,314  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Emil, we spent it.

172
00:12:03,382 --> 00:12:05,350  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
What?

173
00:12:05,417 --> 00:12:08,352  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Emil, look at the way we live.

174
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,650  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I'm a plumber.

175
00:12:10,723 --> 00:12:12,054  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-You think...
-Nice watch.

176
00:12:12,124 --> 00:12:13,853  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
...l'd be working
if I had money?

177
00:12:17,463 --> 00:12:21,763  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
What's going on?
Just give me my money.

178
00:12:21,834 --> 00:12:23,893  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-I'll help you.
-You'll help me?

179
00:12:23,969 --> 00:12:26,665  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Yes. I get you ajob.

180
00:12:26,739 --> 00:12:27,831  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
A job?

181
00:12:27,907 --> 00:12:29,898  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Yeah. The money is good.

182
00:12:29,975 --> 00:12:31,533  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
A job as a plumber?

183
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:33,874  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Yes. It's easy. It's good.

184
00:12:33,946 --> 00:12:38,974  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
You think I came to America
to work?

185
00:12:39,051 --> 00:12:40,143  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
No way.

186
00:12:40,219 --> 00:12:42,517  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Emil, we started over.
You can, too.

187
00:12:43,923 --> 00:12:48,360  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Emil, please. I'm your friend.

188
00:12:51,797 --> 00:12:53,526  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Sorry.
-It's my fault.

189
00:12:53,599 --> 00:12:55,362  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Emil. Please.

190
00:12:56,635 --> 00:13:00,765  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Emil, put down the knife!

191
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,365  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
You spent all my money
while I was in prison?

192
00:13:03,442 --> 00:13:06,036  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
You're telling me to get ajob?

193
00:13:06,111 --> 00:13:08,170  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
As a plumber
fixing fucking toilets?!

194
00:13:08,247 --> 00:13:09,339  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Put down the knife!

195
00:13:09,415 --> 00:13:11,849  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-You're my friend!
-Yes, I am your friend.

196
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:13,509  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
You're my best friend!

197
00:13:13,586 --> 00:13:17,488  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Please, put down the knife.
Emil, please.

198
00:13:35,407 --> 00:13:37,739  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Shut up!

199
00:14:02,401 --> 00:14:04,062  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
She saw.

200
00:14:06,705 --> 00:14:09,799  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-What are you looking for?
-Her wallet, you idiot.

201
00:14:13,712 --> 00:14:16,408  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Daphne Handlova.

202
00:14:16,482 --> 00:14:18,074  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Six-month visa.

203
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:21,813  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Still here after two years.

204
00:14:21,887 --> 00:14:24,117  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
She'll call the police.
She will!

205
00:14:24,189 --> 00:14:25,622  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
She is illegal!

206
00:14:45,911 --> 00:14:48,880  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Turn that fucking
sick thing off!

207
00:14:48,948 --> 00:14:51,678  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Do as I say!

208
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:13,437  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
What are you looking for?

209
00:15:19,812 --> 00:15:23,475  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Bohemian barbecue.

210
00:16:08,027 --> 00:16:09,892  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
What you got for me?

211
00:16:09,962 --> 00:16:11,395  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I don't have time for this.

212
00:16:11,463 --> 00:16:12,794  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Where you think you're going?

213
00:16:12,865 --> 00:16:15,095  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Get the hell out of here.

214
00:16:15,167 --> 00:16:16,828  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
You'll make me bust your ass?

215
00:16:16,902 --> 00:16:19,234  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I'm not telling you again.
This ain't a smart move.

216
00:16:19,304 --> 00:16:21,295  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Give me your fucking money--

217
00:16:21,373 --> 00:16:22,465  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Yo, man--

218
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:24,099  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Happy?
Now you're under arrest.

219
00:16:24,176 --> 00:16:26,474  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-What are you, the cops?
-Fire department.

220
00:16:26,545 --> 00:16:28,137  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Firemen don't carry guns.

221
00:16:28,213 --> 00:16:29,680  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Guess again.

222
00:16:29,748 --> 00:16:32,546  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I'm an arson investigator.
We do everything cops do.

223
00:16:32,618 --> 00:16:35,280  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Come on !
You got to un-ass me, man.

224
00:16:35,354 --> 00:16:37,379  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
We're getting up on three.

225
00:16:37,456 --> 00:16:38,718  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
One, two, three.

226
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:41,351  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Why don't you let a brother off?

227
00:16:41,427 --> 00:16:44,089  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
No harm, no foul.
My bad, dawg.

228
00:16:44,163 --> 00:16:46,131  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
What's up, man? Come on !

229
00:16:47,232 --> 00:16:49,757  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Put your hand up there.
-What you going to do?

230
00:16:49,835 --> 00:16:52,702  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Where you going?
-I'm going to a fire.

231
00:16:52,771 --> 00:16:55,740  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Hell, no!
-I'll send a cop right back!

232
00:16:55,808 --> 00:16:57,002  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Oh, hell, motherfucker!

233
00:16:57,076 --> 00:16:59,840  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
You can't leave me handcuffed
to no goddamn tree!

234
00:16:59,912 --> 00:17:02,540  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Some freak'll come stab me, man !

235
00:17:17,029 --> 00:17:19,827  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Make sure EMS is standing by.

236
00:17:19,898 --> 00:17:21,832  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
We'll have to take
the bodies out pretty soon.

237
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,994  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Let's get the fourth winches
to the front of the building.

238
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:27,630  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Chief, you first due?

239
00:17:27,706 --> 00:17:30,470  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Yeah. I got two roasts
on the top floor...

240
00:17:30,542 --> 00:17:31,873  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
but you don't have
to investigate...

241
00:17:31,944 --> 00:17:34,139  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
because Homicide's here.

242
00:17:34,213 --> 00:17:36,147  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Homicide? Who let them up there?

243
00:17:36,215 --> 00:17:37,682  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I didn't make this
a crime scene yet.

244
00:17:37,749 --> 00:17:39,239  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
It's Eddie Flemming.

245
00:17:39,318 --> 00:17:40,410  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Fuck Eddie Flemming.

246
00:17:40,486 --> 00:17:42,954  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Jordy, where you been?
We got a celebrity.

247
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:45,751  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I heard.
Who the hell let him up there?

248
00:17:45,824 --> 00:17:47,951  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Don't know. Think Eddie'll
give me his autograph?

249
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:49,391  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Maybe he'll give you
a kiss, too.

250
00:17:51,697 --> 00:17:53,562  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Whoa, shit.

251
00:17:53,632 --> 00:17:55,327  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Hey, Cap.
-Bobby.

252
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,594  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Stairs are soggy.

253
00:17:59,671 --> 00:18:01,866  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Hey, Eddie.
-What?

254
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,931  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Looks to me,
from the sixty-nine position...

255
00:18:04,009 --> 00:18:05,840  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
that they were doing each other.

256
00:18:05,911 --> 00:18:07,344  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
They must've been
smoking something...

257
00:18:07,412 --> 00:18:09,346  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
and they were so wacked
out of their heads...

258
00:18:09,414 --> 00:18:11,473  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
that they got careless,
lit up the mattress...

259
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,575  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
and set themselves on fire.

260
00:18:13,652 --> 00:18:15,552  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I don't know.
We got the experts here.

261
00:18:15,621 --> 00:18:17,179  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Show 'em what you found.

262
00:18:17,256 --> 00:18:19,816  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Hope you don't mind, guys.
We thought you needed help.

263
00:18:19,892 --> 00:18:21,291  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Not at all.

264
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,021  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Detective Flemming?
Bobby Korfin.

265
00:18:23,095 --> 00:18:24,289  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
How you doing, Bobby?

266
00:18:24,363 --> 00:18:25,694  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
My uncle Tony
used to work with you...

267
00:18:25,764 --> 00:18:28,824  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Mind putting that cigar out?
Trying to pick up a scent.

268
00:18:28,901 --> 00:18:30,232  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Sorry.

269
00:18:30,302 --> 00:18:32,395  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I'm glad you guys
got it all figured out...

270
00:18:32,471 --> 00:18:34,871  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
but you mind if we go
through our routine?

271
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,339  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Give us something to do.

272
00:18:36,408 --> 00:18:38,501  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
We don't mind.

273
00:18:38,577 --> 00:18:41,011  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
No, no, no. Certainly.

274
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:42,706  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Appreciate it.
-Be our guest.

275
00:18:42,781 --> 00:18:43,907  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Thanks.

276
00:18:43,982 --> 00:18:46,542  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Talk about smoking after sex.

277
00:18:56,161 --> 00:18:58,459  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
We got a fast-burning fire.

278
00:18:59,831 --> 00:19:02,766  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
We got some good
low patterns down here.

279
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:07,499  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Mouth's clean.

280
00:19:07,573 --> 00:19:09,905  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Clean?

281
00:19:09,975 --> 00:19:13,911  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
You think a couple of crackheads
burned themselves up?

282
00:19:13,979 --> 00:19:15,640  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
That's what it looks like.

283
00:19:15,714 --> 00:19:18,581  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
They're burning, they're still
going down on one another?

284
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,811  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Got to hand it to them.

285
00:19:20,886 --> 00:19:23,446  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I guess some people have
their priorities straight.

286
00:19:23,522 --> 00:19:25,251  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I guess they do.

287
00:19:29,261 --> 00:19:30,956  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Flammable.

288
00:19:32,397 --> 00:19:33,989  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Thank you.

289
00:19:34,066 --> 00:19:35,226  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
What's that?

290
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,928  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Evidence of a homicide.

291
00:19:39,738 --> 00:19:42,468  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-You know what that is, right?
-No. What?

292
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:45,135  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Punch a hole in the corner.
I want to look at the floor.

293
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:46,404  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
You got it.

294
00:19:49,147 --> 00:19:51,479  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
No soot in their mouths...

295
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:54,212  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
means they weren't breathing
before the fire.

296
00:19:54,286 --> 00:19:58,222  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
This cloth means they were
doused in a flammable liquid...

297
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:00,053  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
and then positioned on the bed.

298
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:02,753  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
To the untrained eye,
it looks like an accident.

299
00:20:02,828 --> 00:20:03,920  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
No offense.

300
00:20:03,996 --> 00:20:05,725  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
What's he looking for?

301
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,324  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
He's looking for a timer.

302
00:20:16,008 --> 00:20:18,772  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Here you go.
Big double homicide.

303
00:20:20,812 --> 00:20:21,938  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Good.

304
00:20:23,115 --> 00:20:24,742  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Take some deep breaths.

305
00:20:24,816 --> 00:20:29,719  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
You see the look on Eddie's face
when you handed him that timer?

306
00:20:29,788 --> 00:20:32,256  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Damn,
I wish I had a picture of it.

307
00:20:32,324 --> 00:20:34,918  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-He knew all along, though.
-What?

308
00:20:34,993 --> 00:20:37,223  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Why do you think
he was so quiet?

309
00:20:37,296 --> 00:20:39,059  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
He was testing us.

310
00:20:39,131 --> 00:20:40,359  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
You think so?

311
00:20:42,334 --> 00:20:44,199  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Detective,
does it look like a murder?

312
00:20:44,269 --> 00:20:46,601  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
We haven't determined
the exact cause of death yet.

313
00:20:46,672 --> 00:20:48,105  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
There's a lot of answers to get.

314
00:20:48,173 --> 00:20:50,403  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-How many victims?
-We got two bodies.

315
00:20:50,475 --> 00:20:51,772  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Have you identified
those bodies?

316
00:20:51,843 --> 00:20:53,276  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
No, not positively.

317
00:20:53,345 --> 00:20:54,505  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Is it drug-related?

318
00:20:54,579 --> 00:20:57,844  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
We don't know the cause
of the fire or the deaths.

319
00:20:57,916 --> 00:21:00,077  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
We get them all,
we'll let you know.

320
00:21:00,218 --> 00:21:01,810  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
What's in your hand? Evidence?

321
00:21:01,887 --> 00:21:03,218  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Something we found on the scene.

322
00:21:03,288 --> 00:21:06,018  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Whether it's evidence or not
has yet to be determined.

323
00:21:06,091 --> 00:21:07,888  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Thank you, Detective.
-You're welcome.

324
00:21:07,959 --> 00:21:11,122  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Look over here, Eddie!
Come on, big shot!

325
00:21:12,898 --> 00:21:14,889  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
See you.

326
00:21:34,286 --> 00:21:36,151  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Do you see her?
-Who?

327
00:21:37,789 --> 00:21:40,121  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
There was a woman in the crowd.
She looked scared.

328
00:21:40,192 --> 00:21:43,719  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Looked like she wanted
to talk to us or something.

329
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,424  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Aw, shit.

330
00:21:57,008 --> 00:21:59,067  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Get a blanket.

331
00:21:59,144 --> 00:22:01,704  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Now here you come.
It's about fucking time.

332
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,270  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
What the hell happened to you?

333
00:22:03,348 --> 00:22:05,816  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
She stripped me, man.
A bag lady.

334
00:22:05,884 --> 00:22:07,317  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Stripped all my clothes off.

335
00:22:07,386 --> 00:22:09,980  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Grabbing my nuts.
It was disgusting.

336
00:22:10,055 --> 00:22:12,649  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Consider yourself lucky
because I won't lock you up.

337
00:22:12,724 --> 00:22:14,453  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
You're free to go.

338
00:22:14,526 --> 00:22:17,723  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
A dog pissed on me, man !
You violated my civil rights!

339
00:22:17,796 --> 00:22:20,822  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
We got you for robbery one.
Take a walk.

340
00:22:20,899 --> 00:22:23,834  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
So, before you slept with her...

341
00:22:23,902 --> 00:22:26,769  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
with your own son's wife...

342
00:22:26,838 --> 00:22:29,807  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
did you take even a second
to think about the consequences?

343
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:31,308  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I take full responsibility...

344
00:22:31,376 --> 00:22:32,934  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
for sleeping
with my daughter-in-law.

345
00:22:33,011 --> 00:22:35,445  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I had very low self-esteem.

346
00:22:35,514 --> 00:22:37,448  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I felt like I had
to compete with somebody.

347
00:22:37,516 --> 00:22:39,143  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
It just happened to be my son.

348
00:22:39,217 --> 00:22:42,084  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
So you're blaming this all
on having low self-esteem?

349
00:22:42,154 --> 00:22:44,315  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I had a lot of
behavioral disorders.

350
00:22:44,389 --> 00:22:46,323  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
A behavioral disorder
and low self-esteem...

351
00:22:46,391 --> 00:22:48,359  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
makes you have sex
with your son's wife?

352
00:22:48,427 --> 00:22:50,122  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
It's not all his fault, though.

353
00:22:50,195 --> 00:22:53,460  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
It isn't all his fault.
What about your wife?

354
00:22:53,532 --> 00:22:54,965  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
He's ignored me for months.

355
00:22:55,033 --> 00:22:58,833  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I had no one around.
I didn't think that he loved me.

356
00:23:11,116 --> 00:23:14,108  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
How could somebody
who loved somebody do that?

357
00:23:14,186 --> 00:23:16,347  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
That's the lowest thing
you could possibly do to me.

358
00:23:16,421 --> 00:23:18,889  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
"Self-esteem."

359
00:23:24,596 --> 00:23:28,362  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
"Low self-esteem."

360
00:23:53,525 --> 00:23:55,425  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Don't speak to me in Russian.

361
00:23:55,494 --> 00:23:57,223  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
You got it?

362
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,168  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Just erase it!

363
00:24:08,273 --> 00:24:11,242  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Why don't you look at him
and tell him you're sorry?

364
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,544  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Daphne Handlova.

365
00:24:24,656 --> 00:24:26,214  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
What's this?

366
00:24:28,026 --> 00:24:29,857  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
"Worldly Escorts."

367
00:24:29,928 --> 00:24:31,953  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
"Worldly." What is it?

368
00:24:34,933 --> 00:24:36,867  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
What is it?

369
00:24:36,935 --> 00:24:40,166  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Really, I'm serious.
-Get on your knees.

370
00:24:46,144 --> 00:24:49,511  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Get on your knees.

371
00:24:49,581 --> 00:24:53,540  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Look me in the eyes, apologize,
and let me see if I believe you.

372
00:24:53,618 --> 00:24:57,281  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I'm sorry for what I've done.
I'll never do it again.

373
00:24:57,355 --> 00:24:59,823  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
How come we don't believe you?

374
00:25:02,427 --> 00:25:04,918  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Are you looking
for companionship?

375
00:25:04,996 --> 00:25:07,123  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Yes. I'm homesick.

376
00:25:07,198 --> 00:25:11,760  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I can set you up
with a real fine date.

377
00:25:11,836 --> 00:25:14,464  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Do you have Eastern European
girl, Czech girl?

378
00:25:14,539 --> 00:25:15,631  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Of course.

379
00:25:15,707 --> 00:25:17,174  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Ask her for her passport.

380
00:25:17,242 --> 00:25:18,607  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Whatever you want.

381
00:25:18,677 --> 00:25:24,240  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
As a matter of fact, I have
a lovely Czech girl right here.

382
00:25:24,316 --> 00:25:27,285  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Send her. I take her.

383
00:25:27,352 --> 00:25:29,115  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
What's your address?

384
00:25:29,187 --> 00:25:32,418  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Can you forgive him?
-Give me a hug.

385
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:34,822  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Wait a minute. Hold on.

386
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:42,488  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
That's a start.
That's a good start there.

387
00:26:03,221 --> 00:26:06,213  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Maybe Eddie will put you
in his next movie.

388
00:26:06,291 --> 00:26:09,021  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Yeah, you think so?
-Yeah. You can play his wife.

389
00:26:12,697 --> 00:26:14,324  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
What's up, Chief?

390
00:26:14,399 --> 00:26:16,026  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
What the hell is that?

391
00:26:16,101 --> 00:26:18,865  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
What's in your hand? Evidence?

392
00:26:18,937 --> 00:26:20,199  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Something we found on the scene.

393
00:26:20,271 --> 00:26:22,933  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Whether it's evidence or not,
we're not sure yet.

394
00:26:23,008 --> 00:26:25,943  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
You gave Eddie Flemming
the evidence?

395
00:26:26,011 --> 00:26:27,706  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Who did cause and origin?

396
00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:29,940  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Who do you think did? We did.

397
00:26:30,015 --> 00:26:32,449  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Then why didn't you
talk to the reporter?

398
00:26:32,517 --> 00:26:34,485  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
We got more important things
to do...

399
00:26:34,552 --> 00:26:36,520  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Iike finding out who did it.

400
00:26:36,588 --> 00:26:37,816  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Oh, really?

401
00:26:41,893 --> 00:26:45,556  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Don't you guys understand?
It is all about image.

402
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:48,827  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
The better we look, the more
money I get to pay overtime.

403
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:03,774  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Good evening.

404
00:27:03,848 --> 00:27:07,215  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I'm Robert Hawkins,
and this is "Top Story."

405
00:27:07,285 --> 00:27:09,845  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Tonight, an exclusive interview
with Stephen Geller...

406
00:27:09,921 --> 00:27:11,582  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
who horrified the nation
two years ago...

407
00:27:11,656 --> 00:27:13,988  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
when he went berserk
and murdered three clerks...

408
00:27:14,059 --> 00:27:15,549  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
in a Manhattan shoe store.

409
00:27:15,627 --> 00:27:17,788  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
But now,
Mr. Geller's claim...

410
00:27:17,862 --> 00:27:20,194  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
spoken softly
and articulately...

411
00:27:20,265 --> 00:27:22,961  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
is that he is the victim.

412
00:27:23,034 --> 00:27:25,935  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Hard to believe.
Watch.

413
00:27:28,039 --> 00:27:30,633  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
These people died...

414
00:27:30,709 --> 00:27:33,906  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
because of the criminal actions
of my psychiatrist.

415
00:27:33,978 --> 00:27:35,969  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
He didn't insist
I stay on my medication.

416
00:27:36,047 --> 00:27:40,347  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
So you feel no responsibility
for killing these people?

417
00:27:40,418 --> 00:27:43,148  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
My finger pulled the trigger...

418
00:27:43,221 --> 00:27:45,951  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
but morally,
I'm not responsible.

419
00:27:46,024 --> 00:27:48,754  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
My psychiatrist knew
what I was capable of.

420
00:27:48,827 --> 00:27:50,317  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
How can I know?
I'm not a doctor.

421
00:27:50,395 --> 00:27:52,590  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
That seems very savvy
for a man that's been found...

422
00:27:52,664 --> 00:27:54,757  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
mentally incompetent
to stand trial.

423
00:27:54,833 --> 00:27:56,767  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I'm a victim here, too.

424
00:27:56,835 --> 00:27:59,201  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
My life has been
permanently disrupted.

425
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:00,430  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Permanently disrupted?

426
00:28:00,505 --> 00:28:02,871  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Hasn't this incident,
as you call it...

427
00:28:02,941 --> 00:28:05,068  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
jump-started your career
as an artist?

428
00:28:05,143 --> 00:28:07,168  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Isn't there a movie
in the works about you?

429
00:28:07,245 --> 00:28:09,509  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
We're in negotiations.
That's correct.

430
00:28:09,581 --> 00:28:12,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
But doesn't the "Son of Sam" Iaw
prohibit convicted criminals...

431
00:28:12,584 --> 00:28:14,449  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
from profiting
from their crimes?

432
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:17,283  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Doesn't apply to me.
I'm not a criminal.

433
00:28:17,355 --> 00:28:20,153  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I wasn't convicted.

434
00:28:20,225 --> 00:28:23,820  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I was found to be
temporarily insane.

435
00:28:23,895 --> 00:28:26,523  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I love America.

436
00:28:26,598 --> 00:28:30,090  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
No one is responsible
for what they do.

437
00:28:33,538 --> 00:28:36,268  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Get in the bathroom.
-We'll fuck her first.

438
00:28:36,341 --> 00:28:38,434  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Get in the bathroom.
-Fuck her first, right?

439
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:40,068  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Stay there! Shut up!

440
00:28:40,145 --> 00:28:41,271  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Right?

441
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:55,423  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I'm Honey from Worldly Escorts.

442
00:28:55,493 --> 00:28:57,654  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
You called us?

443
00:28:57,729 --> 00:29:00,721  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
And how are you tonight?

444
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:03,324  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Where's the Czech girl?

445
00:29:03,401 --> 00:29:05,528  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Baby,
I'm whatever you want me to be.

446
00:29:05,603 --> 00:29:11,064  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I'm a little schoolgirl,
I'm Mommy, I'm a Czech girl.

447
00:29:11,142 --> 00:29:14,305  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I like to do business
before we get to pleasure.

448
00:29:14,379 --> 00:29:17,177  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Can you put the money
on the dresser?

449
00:29:17,248 --> 00:29:20,649  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Yeah, but I need the Czech girl.

450
00:29:20,718 --> 00:29:22,913  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Daphne--you know her?

451
00:29:22,987 --> 00:29:25,922  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
It's an outcall service
run from a loft.

452
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:28,254  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I don't know the other girls.

453
00:29:28,326 --> 00:29:31,159  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-You going to get undressed?
-Where's the escort service?

454
00:29:31,229 --> 00:29:32,924  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
That's confidential.

455
00:29:32,997 --> 00:29:35,966  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Can you put the money
on the dresser, please?

456
00:29:36,034 --> 00:29:38,093  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Yes. Sure.

457
00:29:38,169 --> 00:29:39,602  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Thank you.

458
00:29:47,946 --> 00:29:52,781  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I'd like to talk with the person
who runs the service.

459
00:29:52,851 --> 00:29:54,546  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Can you give me her address?

460
00:29:54,619 --> 00:29:57,588  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Do we have a problem?

461
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:02,251  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Good, because there's no reason
for us to have a problem.

462
00:30:04,596 --> 00:30:09,260  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I'm going to make you feel
real good.

463
00:30:12,503 --> 00:30:14,733  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Sorry, no smoking.

464
00:30:17,976 --> 00:30:20,444  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
When I'm through with you...

465
00:30:20,511 --> 00:30:24,311  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
you won't even remember
the Czech girl.

466
00:30:27,085 --> 00:30:29,610  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Listen to me.

467
00:30:32,257 --> 00:30:34,191  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I don't want sex.

468
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,352  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Just give me the address,
please.

469
00:30:38,429 --> 00:30:42,297  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I don't give a shit
if you want sex or not...

470
00:30:42,367 --> 00:30:43,925  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
but you're paying me
for my time.

471
00:30:44,002 --> 00:30:45,230  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Just listen to me.

472
00:30:45,303 --> 00:30:49,034  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Just give me the address,
and then you can go.

473
00:30:49,107 --> 00:30:52,304  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
OK, just--No--
What are you doing?

474
00:30:52,377 --> 00:30:54,607  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Listen to me.
You got to help me!

475
00:30:54,679 --> 00:30:57,113  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Calm down and listen to me.

476
00:30:57,181 --> 00:31:00,742  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Give me the fucking address,
and then you go!

477
00:31:00,818 --> 00:31:04,720  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Please, you got to help me.
I need your help!

478
00:31:13,665 --> 00:31:16,293  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
All right! OK! OK!

479
00:31:16,367 --> 00:31:18,562  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
It's in my purse. No!

480
00:31:18,636 --> 00:31:20,263  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Shit! God!

481
00:31:20,338 --> 00:31:21,737  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
What?!

482
00:31:23,508 --> 00:31:25,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Help me!

483
00:31:26,678 --> 00:31:27,804  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
No! Help me!

484
00:31:27,879 --> 00:31:31,144  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
No! God! Someone!
Please help!

485
00:31:36,187 --> 00:31:37,916  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
No! Help!

486
00:31:55,573 --> 00:31:59,373  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
The thing that stood out
about this girl were her eyes.

487
00:31:59,444 --> 00:32:03,642  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
She had the most amazing
huge blue eyes you've ever seen.

488
00:32:03,715 --> 00:32:07,242  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I mean,
just absolutely beautiful.

489
00:32:07,318 --> 00:32:09,912  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
How long they been living
in your building? Four years.

490
00:32:09,988 --> 00:32:11,285  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Yes, I'll hold.

491
00:32:11,356 --> 00:32:14,086  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I'll call as soon
as we know something more.

492
00:32:14,158 --> 00:32:17,616  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-What do you got?
-Milos and Tamina Karlova.

493
00:32:17,695 --> 00:32:19,458  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
They were quiet,
kept to themselves.

494
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:21,361  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Landlord don't know
who your girl is.

495
00:33:07,612 --> 00:33:10,376  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
OK if I smoke?

496
00:33:10,448 --> 00:33:14,350  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
It's your crime scene now.
You can do whatever you want.

497
00:33:14,419 --> 00:33:17,081  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Did you watch the news?

498
00:33:17,155 --> 00:33:18,986  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
No, I must have missed it.

499
00:33:19,057 --> 00:33:22,049  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Well, just so you know...

500
00:33:23,361 --> 00:33:25,829  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I gave you guys all the credit.

501
00:33:25,897 --> 00:33:28,695  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Just so you know...

502
00:33:28,766 --> 00:33:31,530  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I don't really care
about that stuff.

503
00:33:31,602 --> 00:33:34,298  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Why should you?

504
00:33:34,372 --> 00:33:36,465  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I don't even watch TV.

505
00:33:36,541 --> 00:33:40,341  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Good. That's commendable.

506
00:33:44,248 --> 00:33:47,445  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-You get a report from the M.E.?
-Sure did.

507
00:33:49,887 --> 00:33:53,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I want to ask you something.
You got a problem with me?

508
00:33:53,591 --> 00:33:58,187  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
If you found me
stepping on your crime scene--

509
00:33:58,262 --> 00:34:00,822  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
and it was my crime scene
yesterday--

510
00:34:00,898 --> 00:34:02,490  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
it might piss you off, too.

511
00:34:06,571 --> 00:34:08,198  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
What about the report?

512
00:34:08,272 --> 00:34:10,968  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
You were right.
They were dead before the fire.

513
00:34:11,042 --> 00:34:12,339  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
The man was stabbed so hard...

514
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:15,277  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
the tip of the knife
broke off in his spine.

515
00:34:15,346 --> 00:34:17,814  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
That usually indicates
something pretty personal.

516
00:34:29,994 --> 00:34:35,626  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Super said he's seen her before,
but she didn't live here.

517
00:34:36,901 --> 00:34:38,994  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Prettiest suspect
I've had in a while.

518
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:42,233  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I don't know if she has anything
to do with this.

519
00:34:42,306 --> 00:34:45,901  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I saw her after the fire.
I thought it was a lead.

520
00:34:45,977 --> 00:34:47,604  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Thought maybe she saw something.

521
00:34:47,678 --> 00:34:50,670  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Why would they
have taken the trouble...

522
00:34:53,618 --> 00:34:55,745  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
to position the bodies
like that?

523
00:34:57,321 --> 00:34:59,949  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Maybe they're trying
to send somebody a message.

524
00:35:00,024 --> 00:35:03,255  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Burial rites are taken seriously
in Eastern Europe.

525
00:35:03,327 --> 00:35:05,761  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Could be to humiliate them.
-How do you know?

526
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:08,492  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
My folks were from Poland.

527
00:35:15,673 --> 00:35:17,265  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Where?

528
00:35:17,341 --> 00:35:18,740  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Sure it was a knife?

529
00:35:21,145 --> 00:35:22,806  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Really? OK.

530
00:35:25,149 --> 00:35:29,483  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
There was another murder
on 8th Avenue in a hotel.

531
00:35:29,554 --> 00:35:31,454  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
A stabbing.

532
00:35:31,522 --> 00:35:33,990  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Clerk said a Russian
rented the room.

533
00:35:34,058 --> 00:35:36,720  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Mind if I go along with you?

534
00:35:36,794 --> 00:35:40,093  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
This isn't a fire.
There's nothing for you to do.

535
00:35:40,164 --> 00:35:42,462  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I'll watch you.
Maybe I'll learn something.

536
00:35:42,533 --> 00:35:43,966  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
This isn't homicide school, kid.

537
00:35:44,035 --> 00:35:46,697  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
But if you want to help,
take that.

538
00:35:47,905 --> 00:35:49,600  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
What's this?

539
00:35:49,674 --> 00:35:51,972  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
The matching set
for the murder weapon.

540
00:35:58,282 --> 00:36:00,716  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
This is our second day
in America.

541
00:36:00,785 --> 00:36:05,154  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
First day was very exciting,
full of thrills and chills.

542
00:36:05,223 --> 00:36:09,091  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Over here is the costar
of my new movie.

543
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,355  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
My partner Emil.

544
00:36:11,429 --> 00:36:14,193  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Who's this?

545
00:36:14,265 --> 00:36:16,358  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
That is New York's finest.

546
00:36:16,434 --> 00:36:18,299  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Yeah, that's his case.

547
00:36:21,772 --> 00:36:23,467  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Is that all you want?

548
00:36:23,541 --> 00:36:27,375  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Do you know how much killer gets
for movie rights?

549
00:36:27,445 --> 00:36:29,003  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
It says he wants a million.

550
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,105  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
A million?

551
00:36:31,182 --> 00:36:32,547  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
You're kidding.

552
00:36:32,617 --> 00:36:35,711  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
The killer gets a million
for television interview?

553
00:36:36,754 --> 00:36:38,949  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
It pays to be a killer
in this country.

554
00:36:44,595 --> 00:36:46,085  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Taking a bath.

555
00:36:46,163 --> 00:36:47,653  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Any l.D.?

556
00:36:47,732 --> 00:36:51,031  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-P.D. only.
-No, he's OK.

557
00:36:51,102 --> 00:36:52,660  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
We still got to run some prints.

558
00:36:52,737 --> 00:36:56,833  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
This kid here from midtown
caught the case.

559
00:36:56,907 --> 00:36:58,898  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-How you doing? Tommy Cullen.
-Hiya, son.

560
00:36:58,976 --> 00:37:01,206  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
A pleasure to finally meet you.

561
00:37:01,279 --> 00:37:03,975  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
This is what we got.
Figure she's a prostitute.

562
00:37:04,048 --> 00:37:06,710  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Judging from the defense wounds
on her arms and hands...

563
00:37:06,784 --> 00:37:08,752  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
she was really fighting
for her life.

564
00:37:08,819 --> 00:37:13,153  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
The room was registered
to a Frank Capra.

565
00:37:13,224 --> 00:37:14,851  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Capra?
Who said this guy's Russian?

566
00:37:14,925 --> 00:37:16,153  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
The clerk.

567
00:37:16,227 --> 00:37:18,491  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Check with the switchboard.
See what calls came from here.

568
00:37:18,562 --> 00:37:20,530  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I'm on it.
Excuse me, gentlemen.

569
00:37:20,598 --> 00:37:23,396  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
We're waiting on the M.E.
to find out if she was raped.

570
00:37:23,467 --> 00:37:26,800  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
We got a shitload of prints,
but they could be anybody's.

571
00:37:26,871 --> 00:37:29,499  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Anybody take a piss lately?

572
00:37:29,573 --> 00:37:32,701  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Check the toilet seat.

573
00:37:32,777 --> 00:37:35,075  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Only one guy checked in?

574
00:37:43,587 --> 00:37:45,748  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
You want to go
to homicide school?

575
00:37:45,823 --> 00:37:47,688  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Let me show you something.

576
00:37:47,758 --> 00:37:50,727  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
The killer was standing there,
slashing her.

577
00:37:50,795 --> 00:37:54,287  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
At death, the heart stops,
so you don't bleed anymore.

578
00:37:54,365 --> 00:37:55,593  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
See these two marks?

579
00:37:55,666 --> 00:37:58,328  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Somebody else was standing here
while the killer stabbed her.

580
00:37:58,402 --> 00:37:59,699  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Murph.

581
00:38:01,005 --> 00:38:03,599  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
What kind of knife
we talking about?

582
00:38:03,674 --> 00:38:08,043  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
If you look at the marks
on the wall over here...

583
00:38:08,112 --> 00:38:10,444  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
they're wide but not very deep.

584
00:38:10,514 --> 00:38:13,483  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
This was not your everyday
kitchen or pocketknife.

585
00:38:13,551 --> 00:38:15,178  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
What if the tip was broken off?

586
00:38:15,252 --> 00:38:17,618  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Could be. Then we'd
probably find it somewhere.

587
00:38:17,688 --> 00:38:19,280  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I think we already found it.

588
00:38:19,357 --> 00:38:23,088  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
There was only one phone call
made from this room last night.

589
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,219  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I dialed it,
and it was an escort service.

590
00:38:25,296 --> 00:38:28,732  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Did you identify yourself?
-I'm new, not stupid.

591
00:38:28,799 --> 00:38:31,290  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Call communications. Let's get
an address on that number.

592
00:38:34,638 --> 00:38:35,764  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Good work.

593
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,603  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Thanks.

594
00:38:37,675 --> 00:38:42,112  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Going to the escort service?
-I'll let you know what happens.

595
00:38:42,179 --> 00:38:44,613  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Eddie, you the man, bro!

596
00:38:44,682 --> 00:38:46,206  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Eddie, this is ridiculous.

597
00:38:46,283 --> 00:38:49,184  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
If I ride with you,
we can talk over the case.

598
00:38:49,253 --> 00:38:51,016  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I'll tell you what.

599
00:38:51,088 --> 00:38:53,488  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I'll bounce this coin.
You win, you come.

600
00:38:53,557 --> 00:38:56,617  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
If you don't win,
you don't come. Fair enough?

601
00:38:56,694 --> 00:38:58,855  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
All right, but I call it.

602
00:38:58,929 --> 00:39:00,089  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
You call it.

603
00:39:01,732 --> 00:39:04,064  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
One, two, three...

604
00:39:04,135 --> 00:39:06,296  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Tails.
-Heads. You lose.

605
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:09,737  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
That's bullshit.
I didn't get to see.

606
00:39:09,807 --> 00:39:11,900  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Go ahead. I'll call it.

607
00:39:11,976 --> 00:39:13,773  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Heads.

608
00:39:13,844 --> 00:39:15,778  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
See? You lost twice.

609
00:39:18,849 --> 00:39:20,976  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
See you around.

610
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:24,588  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Come on.

611
00:39:24,655 --> 00:39:26,486  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
All right.

612
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:34,758  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I can't say that.
I don't know.

613
00:39:37,234 --> 00:39:38,861  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
That supposed to be funny?

614
00:39:38,936 --> 00:39:41,461  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Yeah, come on.

615
00:39:43,607 --> 00:39:44,699  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I'm just joking.

616
00:39:44,775 --> 00:39:46,333  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Thanks for letting me come.

617
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:48,037  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
No problem. Souvenir.

618
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,772  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Two heads.

619
00:39:50,848 --> 00:39:52,679  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Who's there?
-Better than one.

620
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:56,447  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Police. We want to ask you
some questions.

621
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:59,785  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-You have a warrant?
-We're not busting you.

622
00:39:59,857 --> 00:40:01,620  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
It's Detective Eddie Flemming
from Homicide.

623
00:40:01,692 --> 00:40:04,525  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Just open the door.
We want to talk.

624
00:40:04,595 --> 00:40:06,620  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Oh, my God, what an honor.

625
00:40:06,697 --> 00:40:09,222  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Rose Hearn. Please come in.

626
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:12,667  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I just saw you on television.

627
00:40:12,736 --> 00:40:15,671  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-You look better in real life.
-Thank you.

628
00:40:15,739 --> 00:40:17,730  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Just give me one second.

629
00:40:26,817 --> 00:40:29,513  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
What can I help you with,
Detective?

630
00:40:29,587 --> 00:40:32,784  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I think one of your girls
got murdered last night...

631
00:40:32,857 --> 00:40:34,256  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
at the King Edward Hotel.

632
00:40:34,325 --> 00:40:36,953  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
What?

633
00:40:37,027 --> 00:40:38,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Did you send anybody over there?

634
00:40:38,829 --> 00:40:42,663  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Yeah. Honey.

635
00:40:42,733 --> 00:40:44,758  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Yeah, she's one of my girls.

636
00:40:44,835 --> 00:40:47,065  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-She's dead?
-I'm afraid so.

637
00:40:47,137 --> 00:40:48,764  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Oh, my God.

638
00:40:48,839 --> 00:40:50,534  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
You all right?

639
00:40:51,675 --> 00:40:53,734  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-You want some water?
-Please.

640
00:40:53,811 --> 00:40:55,142  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Some water, please.

641
00:40:55,212 --> 00:40:56,975  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
What was she doing there?

642
00:40:57,047 --> 00:41:00,539  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
She was on a date with a guy.

643
00:41:00,618 --> 00:41:03,314  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
He called
for a Czechoslovakian girl.

644
00:41:03,387 --> 00:41:04,786  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I sent him Honey...

645
00:41:04,855 --> 00:41:07,722  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
because once they get there,
it doesn't really matter.

646
00:41:07,791 --> 00:41:10,259  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Do you have Czech girls
working for you?

647
00:41:10,327 --> 00:41:13,592  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
No, but he insisted on one.

648
00:41:13,664 --> 00:41:16,098  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Does this girl look familiar?

649
00:41:20,271 --> 00:41:21,602  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Linda?

650
00:41:28,646 --> 00:41:30,113  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
What were you saying?

651
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:34,640  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I think I know this girl.
Daphne. She's a Czech girl.

652
00:41:34,718 --> 00:41:36,618  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I tried to recruit her.
I gave her my card.

653
00:41:36,687 --> 00:41:37,881  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I never heard back.

654
00:41:37,955 --> 00:41:40,355  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
She's very popular
all of a sudden.

655
00:41:40,424 --> 00:41:42,517  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-You have a last name?
-I don't know.

656
00:41:42,593 --> 00:41:47,257  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I just had two guys come in here
a second ago asking about her.

657
00:41:47,331 --> 00:41:48,457  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Who were they?

658
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,901  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
One guy said he was her cousin
trying to find her.

659
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:55,165  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
They had a video camera.
He was taping.

660
00:41:55,239 --> 00:41:57,833  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I just wanted them to get out,
so I told them where she worked.

661
00:41:57,908 --> 00:41:59,000  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Where's that?

662
00:41:59,076 --> 00:42:01,044  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
It's a salon
on 63rd and Madison.

663
00:42:01,111 --> 00:42:02,703  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
63rd and Madison?
What's the name?

664
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:05,180  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Ludwig's. She works there.
She washes hair.

665
00:42:07,685 --> 00:42:11,519  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Leon, Ludwig's Hair Salon.
Something might be there.

666
00:42:11,589 --> 00:42:13,989  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
We think the suspects
will be there.

667
00:42:14,058 --> 00:42:15,753  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Want a sip?

668
00:42:15,826 --> 00:42:17,851  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-I'm on duty.
-So am l.

669
00:42:37,681 --> 00:42:39,273  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Hunting for Daphne.

670
00:42:43,053 --> 00:42:45,078  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I'll go inside.
You cover the exit.

671
00:42:45,155 --> 00:42:46,281  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Of course.

672
00:42:46,357 --> 00:42:50,726  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I always wanted to be a cop
when I was a kid.

673
00:42:50,794 --> 00:42:53,524  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Dreamt about pulling out my gun,
kicking in the door...

674
00:42:53,597 --> 00:42:55,121  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
yelling "freeze" at the bad guy.

675
00:42:56,934 --> 00:42:58,367  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
What did you dream about?

676
00:42:58,435 --> 00:43:00,494  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Running up
to a burning building...

677
00:43:00,571 --> 00:43:01,663  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
kicking down the door...

678
00:43:01,739 --> 00:43:03,502  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
rushing through the smoke,
and saving a kid.

679
00:43:03,574 --> 00:43:06,270  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I guess we're doing it
the right way.

680
00:43:06,343 --> 00:43:09,073  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
If we pulled up to a burning
building, I'd let you go first.

681
00:43:10,581 --> 00:43:11,946  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Watch out.

682
00:43:14,318 --> 00:43:15,979  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Fuck.

683
00:43:16,053 --> 00:43:18,385  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
The thrill of the hunt.

684
00:43:24,228 --> 00:43:25,388  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Excuse me.

685
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:28,054  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Sorry.

686
00:43:28,132 --> 00:43:29,463  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I'm looking for Daphne.

687
00:43:29,533 --> 00:43:32,525  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I don't know where...
Maybe in front.

688
00:43:32,603 --> 00:43:33,729  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Thanks.

689
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:01,392  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I've got a temper.

690
00:44:01,465 --> 00:44:05,265  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
When I lose it, I lose control.

691
00:44:05,335 --> 00:44:08,463  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Get out of here!

692
00:44:08,539 --> 00:44:10,530  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I didn't intend to kill Milos.

693
00:44:10,607 --> 00:44:14,099  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
When I went to prison,
they beat me.

694
00:44:14,178 --> 00:44:17,579  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I still didn't tell
he was my partner.

695
00:44:17,648 --> 00:44:20,014  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I loved Milos like a brother.

696
00:44:21,452 --> 00:44:24,819  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Daphne,
will you be coming back to work?

697
00:44:24,888 --> 00:44:27,823  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Yes, in a minute, Ludwig.
-Yeah, come.

698
00:44:27,891 --> 00:44:30,587  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Thank you.

699
00:44:30,661 --> 00:44:33,391  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I don't want to kill you.

700
00:44:33,464 --> 00:44:34,726  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
But if you talk...

701
00:44:37,434 --> 00:44:38,696  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I will.

702
00:44:42,606 --> 00:44:44,870  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I thought...

703
00:44:44,942 --> 00:44:46,136  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
you'd want this.

704
00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:48,269  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
This was Tamina's necklace.

705
00:44:48,345 --> 00:44:50,370  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Keep it.

706
00:44:53,784 --> 00:44:55,411  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Let's get out of here.

707
00:45:00,657 --> 00:45:02,955  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Good-bye, my love.

708
00:45:16,406 --> 00:45:19,273  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Your name's Daphne, right?

709
00:45:19,343 --> 00:45:22,369  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Remember at the fire,
you saw me?

710
00:45:23,447 --> 00:45:25,938  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
You were trying
to tell me something.

711
00:45:26,016 --> 00:45:28,644  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I got it.
I smell smoke across the street.

712
00:45:28,719 --> 00:45:31,711  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
We just want to talk to you.
We're here to protect you.

713
00:45:32,790 --> 00:45:33,984  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
You speak English?

714
00:45:35,125 --> 00:45:37,286  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
You speak English, don't you?

715
00:45:38,328 --> 00:45:39,989  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
OK, let's go this way.

716
00:45:45,569 --> 00:45:48,231  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Did two guys visit you today?

717
00:45:52,442 --> 00:45:54,569  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
What's that? Who gave you this?

718
00:46:04,555 --> 00:46:06,489  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Across the street,
two guys with a video camera.

719
00:46:06,557 --> 00:46:10,323  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Don't look! It's OK.
Let's just box them in.

720
00:46:10,394 --> 00:46:12,919  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
You stay here with her.

721
00:46:14,031 --> 00:46:15,225  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Come on, let's go.

722
00:46:30,614 --> 00:46:33,310  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Shit! Go!

723
00:46:37,087 --> 00:46:38,952  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Goddamn !

724
00:46:42,092 --> 00:46:44,458  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Split up!

725
00:46:44,528 --> 00:46:46,621  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Fuck! Go!

726
00:46:47,764 --> 00:46:50,130  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Son of a bitch !

727
00:46:54,905 --> 00:46:57,203  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Get the fuck out of the road!

728
00:47:05,182 --> 00:47:07,548  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Move! Damn !

729
00:47:08,986 --> 00:47:10,715  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
On the bus!

730
00:47:22,032 --> 00:47:23,192  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Look out!
-Be careful!

731
00:47:23,267 --> 00:47:24,962  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Oh, my God!

732
00:47:27,871 --> 00:47:29,395  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Excuse me! Move!

733
00:47:29,473 --> 00:47:30,599  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I'm a cop!

734
00:47:47,691 --> 00:47:50,319  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Hey, look, look!

735
00:47:50,394 --> 00:47:51,884  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Watch out!

736
00:47:55,933 --> 00:47:57,366  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Perfect! Cut! Print!

737
00:48:02,239 --> 00:48:04,264  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Don't shoot!

738
00:48:04,341 --> 00:48:06,707  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Bobby, you OK?
-I'm all right.

739
00:48:06,777 --> 00:48:09,769  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
They went towards the park,
towards the park!

740
00:48:09,846 --> 00:48:10,972  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
You hit?

741
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:16,483  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Got my piece.

742
00:48:16,553 --> 00:48:18,544  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Let's get out of here!
-I don't believe this.

743
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,835  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Did you get him?

744
00:48:40,777 --> 00:48:41,937  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Think so.

745
00:48:47,517 --> 00:48:48,882  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I'm here, Leon.

746
00:48:48,952 --> 00:48:52,718  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-I'm having a bad day, man.
-You'll be OK.

747
00:48:52,789 --> 00:48:53,881  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
...armed and dangerous.

748
00:48:53,957 --> 00:48:56,425  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
We've surrounded the park.
They've disappeared.

749
00:48:56,493 --> 00:48:58,393  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
...to parts unknown
within Central Park.

750
00:48:58,462 --> 00:49:02,626  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Can you tell us what happened?
-I can't talk right now.

751
00:49:02,699 --> 00:49:04,894  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
What's the fire marshal
doing here?

752
00:49:04,968 --> 00:49:07,459  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I can't give any statements now.
I'm sorry.

753
00:49:07,537 --> 00:49:09,664  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Your partner, Leon Jackson,
is injured. Correct?

754
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:11,708  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
He was hurt, but not seriously.

755
00:49:11,775 --> 00:49:15,108  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-You have a suspect in custody?
-Now's not a good time.

756
00:49:15,178 --> 00:49:18,045  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Detective Jackson was not hurt
seriously. That's all.

757
00:49:18,115 --> 00:49:20,049  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
All right.
Eddie, are you all right?

758
00:49:20,117 --> 00:49:22,051  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Not a good time. All right?

759
00:49:22,119 --> 00:49:23,882  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
All right.

760
00:49:26,356 --> 00:49:29,792  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-If you'd cooperate...
-Let me tell you something.

761
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:32,988  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I want to know who these guys
are and how you're involved.

762
00:49:33,063 --> 00:49:35,531  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I don't know them.
I've never seen them before.

763
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:38,227  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I was showering.
Tamina is a friend of mine.

764
00:49:38,301 --> 00:49:40,292  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
My shower was broken,
so she let me use theirs.

765
00:49:40,370 --> 00:49:41,701  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Go on.
-That's it.

766
00:49:41,772 --> 00:49:43,069  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I saw the killings.
I don't know why.

767
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:46,803  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Why are you protecting them?
-I'm not. I'm protecting myself.

768
00:49:46,877 --> 00:49:49,402  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
From what?
Are you here illegally?

769
00:49:49,479 --> 00:49:51,310  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Don't worry.
We'll talk to lmmigration.

770
00:49:51,381 --> 00:49:54,248  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Don't talk to lmmigration.
-Why not?

771
00:49:54,317 --> 00:49:56,512  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
You better tell us.
We'll find out.

772
00:49:56,586 --> 00:49:57,883  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Better it comes from you.

773
00:49:57,954 --> 00:49:59,080  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
You understand?

774
00:49:59,156 --> 00:50:01,056  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Let's make some room.
Bring him in.

775
00:50:08,498 --> 00:50:09,965  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
You want to sit down?

776
00:50:10,033 --> 00:50:11,660  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Why don't you sit down?

777
00:50:14,738 --> 00:50:16,672  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
You want a glass of water?

778
00:50:29,853 --> 00:50:33,482  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
My little sister and I
shared a flat.

779
00:50:33,557 --> 00:50:37,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I came home one night,
and a man was raping her.

780
00:50:38,628 --> 00:50:42,257  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
His gun was on the chair,
I grabbed it...

781
00:50:42,332 --> 00:50:45,665  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
and when he came at me,
I shot him.

782
00:50:45,735 --> 00:50:47,202  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
That's ajustifiable homicide.

783
00:50:47,270 --> 00:50:50,433  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Yes, but he was a cop.

784
00:50:50,507 --> 00:50:53,965  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
So you shot him,
and you killed a cop?

785
00:50:54,044 --> 00:50:57,571  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I was living in a small town
in Slovakia.

786
00:50:57,647 --> 00:50:59,080  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
We don't want to hear
your life story.

787
00:50:59,149 --> 00:51:02,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I got an officer shot.
Where can we find these guys?

788
00:51:02,586 --> 00:51:04,884  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
You're a cop.
You won't help me.

789
00:51:04,955 --> 00:51:07,549  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I won't help you
unless you help us.

790
00:51:07,624 --> 00:51:11,890  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Eddie, can I talk to you alone
for a second?

791
00:51:11,962 --> 00:51:13,429  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
For a second.

792
00:51:19,870 --> 00:51:23,567  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Even if she is telling
the truth, she's fucked.

793
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:27,736  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Would you mind
letting me talk to her?

794
00:51:27,811 --> 00:51:30,371  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Any leads I get,
they're yours...

795
00:51:30,447 --> 00:51:33,211  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
but let me
get first crack at her.

796
00:51:33,283 --> 00:51:35,808  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
You want to talk to her alone?

797
00:51:35,886 --> 00:51:38,548  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
This girl is scared,
you're intimidating her.

798
00:51:38,622 --> 00:51:40,681  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Big hotshot celebrity.
I'm a nobody.

799
00:51:40,757 --> 00:51:42,247  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Maybe she'll open up with me.

800
00:51:42,325 --> 00:51:44,020  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Maybe she looks at me different.

801
00:51:44,094 --> 00:51:46,961  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
What is this?
You'll be her savior?

802
00:51:47,030 --> 00:51:49,260  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
This the girl you'll save
from the burning building?

803
00:51:49,332 --> 00:51:50,526  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I'm being serious.

804
00:51:57,340 --> 00:51:59,968  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
OK, I'll give you a head start.

805
00:52:00,043 --> 00:52:02,637  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Get her to the station house.
Don't let her out of your sight.

806
00:52:02,712 --> 00:52:04,441  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
She's the only warm body
we got left.

807
00:52:04,514 --> 00:52:06,778  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Come on, I'm a professional.

808
00:52:06,850 --> 00:52:08,477  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Women like that have a way...

809
00:52:08,552 --> 00:52:10,850  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
of turning professionals
into amateurs.

810
00:52:37,914 --> 00:52:39,848  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
What are you doing?

811
00:52:39,916 --> 00:52:42,214  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I've got to light
this scene better.

812
00:52:42,285 --> 00:52:44,048  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Make it more dramatic.

813
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:47,180  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Just like in the movie,
"Silence of the Sheeps."

814
00:52:47,257 --> 00:52:48,417  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Shut up.

815
00:52:49,693 --> 00:52:50,921  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Hurts?

816
00:53:02,239 --> 00:53:04,070  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Big enough?

817
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:05,232  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Just kidding.

818
00:53:05,308 --> 00:53:06,707  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Want to get married?

819
00:53:10,313 --> 00:53:12,713  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I love you.
You want to get married?

820
00:53:12,782 --> 00:53:14,181  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Sweetheart.

821
00:53:17,454 --> 00:53:18,648  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Come on.

822
00:54:11,241 --> 00:54:13,038  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
She's here.

823
00:54:13,109 --> 00:54:14,235  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
She's here?

824
00:54:20,850 --> 00:54:22,875  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
What does that mean?

825
00:54:25,388 --> 00:54:26,946  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
"Good luck" in Greek.

826
00:54:27,023 --> 00:54:29,150  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Good luck in English.

827
00:54:33,596 --> 00:54:34,893  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Are you married?

828
00:54:37,133 --> 00:54:38,998  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Do you live alone?

829
00:54:41,037 --> 00:54:43,335  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I haven't showered
since the killings.

830
00:54:43,406 --> 00:54:44,896  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
We could stop at your place.

831
00:54:44,974 --> 00:54:49,104  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I could take a shower
before we go back to custody.

832
00:54:49,179 --> 00:54:50,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Look, l...

833
00:54:51,614 --> 00:54:55,311  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I can't take you
back to my place.

834
00:54:55,385 --> 00:54:57,114  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Then somewhere else?

835
00:55:00,390 --> 00:55:02,790  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
How's it going, Eddie?

836
00:55:03,827 --> 00:55:06,523  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Eddie, how are you?
-Not too good.

837
00:55:18,908 --> 00:55:22,036  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
You have a funny way
of showing it.

838
00:55:23,213 --> 00:55:25,044  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Yeah, me, too.

839
00:55:25,115 --> 00:55:26,707  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Why'd you snap at me?

840
00:55:26,783 --> 00:55:29,411  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-I didn't snap.
-You did.

841
00:55:29,486 --> 00:55:30,714  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Just wanted a statement.

842
00:55:30,787 --> 00:55:33,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I can't answer you
every time you want me to.

843
00:55:33,823 --> 00:55:37,224  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
You didn't have to embarrass me.

844
00:55:37,293 --> 00:55:40,854  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Sorry. I didn't mean
to embarrass you.

845
00:55:40,930 --> 00:55:43,592  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-You know that.
-It's all right.

846
00:55:46,403 --> 00:55:47,529  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
You OK?

847
00:55:58,481 --> 00:56:02,417  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Blood is all over your watch.
Is it Leon's?

848
00:56:02,485 --> 00:56:04,646  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Yeah. Probably. Has to be.

849
00:56:07,323 --> 00:56:10,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Is he going to be all right?

850
00:56:10,226 --> 00:56:13,024  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
He'll be OK.

851
00:56:14,664 --> 00:56:17,462  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
You had that schoolteacher's
blood on your shoes.

852
00:56:19,702 --> 00:56:22,637  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I don't know how you do it.

853
00:56:25,742 --> 00:56:29,576  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Speaking of shoes,
you know what I was thinking?

854
00:56:31,514 --> 00:56:35,814  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I would like to have...

855
00:56:39,589 --> 00:56:41,750  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
some shoes next to my shoes.

856
00:56:46,563 --> 00:56:47,655  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Wait.

857
00:56:47,730 --> 00:56:50,255  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
What are you doing?

858
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:13,211  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Forget the phone.
What are you--

859
00:57:13,289 --> 00:57:15,553  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Go ahead. Answer the phone.
-Shit.

860
00:57:18,328 --> 00:57:19,420  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Nicky, it's me.

861
00:57:19,496 --> 00:57:22,624  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Can I call you back?
-No. We can't find Katie.

862
00:57:22,699 --> 00:57:25,190  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
We want you to anchor right now.

863
00:57:25,268 --> 00:57:27,498  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Get in a cab
and be here in an hour.

864
00:57:27,570 --> 00:57:29,435  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Wait a minute. Now? Right now?

865
00:57:29,506 --> 00:57:32,532  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
You want your shot?
Come now.

866
00:57:36,346 --> 00:57:38,974  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
They want me to anchor.

867
00:57:39,048 --> 00:57:40,640  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Great.
-Tonight.

868
00:57:40,717 --> 00:57:43,208  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Great, great.
-Oh, my God.

869
00:57:46,256 --> 00:57:50,090  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Forget that for a second.
What...

870
00:57:50,159 --> 00:57:51,854  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
No, when you come back.

871
00:57:51,928 --> 00:57:53,418  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
You promise?
We'll talk tonight?

872
00:57:53,496 --> 00:57:55,123  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Of course I promise.

873
00:57:55,198 --> 00:57:57,826  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I'll see you when you come back.

874
00:57:57,901 --> 00:57:59,960  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Go ahead.
You'll be great.

875
00:58:00,036 --> 00:58:01,560  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I love you, Eddie.

876
00:58:01,638 --> 00:58:03,799  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I love you, sweetheart.

877
00:58:07,610 --> 00:58:09,407  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-See you tonight.
-See you tonight.

878
00:58:09,479 --> 00:58:11,071  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Good luck.

879
00:58:13,082 --> 00:58:14,208  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Don't be late.

880
00:58:53,256 --> 00:58:56,054  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
The video of Milos
and Tamina...

881
00:58:56,125 --> 00:58:57,786  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I told you to erase it.

882
00:58:57,860 --> 00:59:00,590  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I erased everything.
It's all gone.

883
00:59:00,663 --> 00:59:03,461  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Don't lie. I won't be angry.

884
00:59:05,468 --> 00:59:06,594  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Why not?

885
00:59:15,678 --> 00:59:16,770  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
What is it?

886
00:59:16,846 --> 00:59:19,644  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
What does it look like?
It's an address book.

887
00:59:19,716 --> 00:59:22,514  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I took it from the black cop.

888
00:59:25,388 --> 00:59:26,787  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
What's this?

889
00:59:28,625 --> 00:59:30,650  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
What is it?

890
00:59:41,404 --> 00:59:45,932  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
"Eddie Flemming."

891
00:59:49,512 --> 00:59:54,609  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Why won't you be angry at me
for keeping my movie?

892
00:59:58,521 --> 01:00:00,455  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
You'll see.

893
01:00:01,858 --> 01:00:04,486  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Come. Bring the camera.

894
01:00:14,203 --> 01:00:16,296  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
My name is Frank Capra.

895
01:00:16,372 --> 01:00:18,306  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I'm a famous Hollywood director.

896
01:00:23,312 --> 01:00:24,973  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
There she is!

897
01:00:39,796 --> 01:00:41,923  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Warsaw.

898
01:00:41,998 --> 01:00:44,091  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Chief, what are you doing here?

899
01:00:44,167 --> 01:00:45,259  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
What am I doing here?

900
01:00:45,334 --> 01:00:48,201  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I came to see how
the investigation is going.

901
01:00:48,271 --> 01:00:49,670  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I called,
and you're not here.

902
01:00:49,739 --> 01:00:51,570  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I waited by the station house,
you never show up.

903
01:00:51,641 --> 01:00:53,575  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I beep you,
you don't return my call.

904
01:00:53,643 --> 01:00:55,668  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Where the hell have you been?

905
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:00,010  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Ladder 21 was at training.

906
01:01:00,083 --> 01:01:02,244  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
We stopped there
so she could get cleaned up.

907
01:01:02,318 --> 01:01:03,649  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
What do you mean, cleaned up?

908
01:01:05,521 --> 01:01:07,819  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-I let her take a shower.
-A shower?

909
01:01:07,890 --> 01:01:09,755  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Did you take one, too?

910
01:01:09,826 --> 01:01:13,592  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
She's been through a lot.
I'm trying to help her.

911
01:01:13,663 --> 01:01:14,891  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
That's really nice of you.

912
01:01:14,964 --> 01:01:17,023  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
You take a homicide witness
to take a shower...

913
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:18,328  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
after your partner's been shot.

914
01:01:18,401 --> 01:01:20,301  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Are you
out of your fucking mind?

915
01:01:20,369 --> 01:01:22,098  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
You having trouble
getting dates?

916
01:01:22,171 --> 01:01:24,435  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I told him to take her there.
Tommy, get her out of here.

917
01:01:24,507 --> 01:01:27,374  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
The press was all over.
I didn't want her in the news.

918
01:01:27,443 --> 01:01:29,707  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I told him to take her someplace
quiet till things calmed down.

919
01:01:29,779 --> 01:01:32,304  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Really?
-It was my decision. Not his.

920
01:01:32,381 --> 01:01:34,713  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I am
the Deputy Chief Fire Marshal...

921
01:01:34,784 --> 01:01:36,718  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
and I like to be
included in decisions.

922
01:01:36,786 --> 01:01:38,777  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I understand.
Once he briefs me...

923
01:01:38,855 --> 01:01:42,382  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
take over the press conference
and the lead in the case.

924
01:01:43,559 --> 01:01:44,685  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
All right.

925
01:01:44,761 --> 01:01:46,820  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I'm ready to be briefed.

926
01:01:48,397 --> 01:01:50,422  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Excuse us.
-Sure.

927
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:52,832  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Are you ready to brief me?

928
01:01:52,902 --> 01:01:54,460  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Good.

929
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:00,065  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Wait.

930
01:02:03,212 --> 01:02:06,477  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Can you just give us
a few minutes, please?

931
01:02:06,549 --> 01:02:07,846  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Thanks.

932
01:02:09,018 --> 01:02:11,919  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Shut that door when you go out.
Thanks, guys.

933
01:02:13,956 --> 01:02:15,890  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Just so you know,
I didn't touch her.

934
01:02:15,958 --> 01:02:18,654  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Maybe you should've. Nobody
will believe you, including me.

935
01:02:18,728 --> 01:02:20,218  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
It wasn't the smartest thing
to do...

936
01:02:20,296 --> 01:02:22,321  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
but I swear to you,
nothing happened.

937
01:02:22,398 --> 01:02:23,956  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
It wasn't
the smartest thing to do.

938
01:02:24,033 --> 01:02:26,160  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
You ought to know better.

939
01:02:26,235 --> 01:02:29,136  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
She's got the potential
to hang you.

940
01:02:29,205 --> 01:02:32,106  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
If she even suggests you made
a pass at her, it's over.

941
01:02:32,175 --> 01:02:34,473  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
You can deny it.
It won't matter.

942
01:02:34,544 --> 01:02:37,741  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-You never went out on a limb?
-Know how you go out on a limb?

943
01:02:37,814 --> 01:02:41,306  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
You say, "Here's the name
of an immigration lawyer."

944
01:02:41,384 --> 01:02:43,909  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-You'd believe her, too.
-You'll jeopardize your career.

945
01:02:43,986 --> 01:02:46,614  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
You'll jeopardize your life
and my case.

946
01:02:46,689 --> 01:02:49,283  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Another piece of advice.

947
01:02:49,358 --> 01:02:52,885  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
You don't watch TV,
but I'll tell you a secret...

948
01:02:52,962 --> 01:02:54,862  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
The whole fucking world
watches television.

949
01:02:54,931 --> 01:02:57,195  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
When you go out there,
they know your face.

950
01:02:57,266 --> 01:03:01,635  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
And the little bit of fame that
I have in this fucking city...

951
01:03:01,704 --> 01:03:03,331  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
makes my job a lot easier...

952
01:03:03,406 --> 01:03:05,897  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
and I get a lot more done
because of it.

953
01:03:05,975 --> 01:03:07,943  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
So why'd you stand up for me
with the chief?

954
01:03:12,882 --> 01:03:15,407  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I don't know.

955
01:03:15,484 --> 01:03:17,782  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
You remind me of a puppy I had.

956
01:03:17,854 --> 01:03:21,017  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Pissed all over the carpet,
but I still kept him.

957
01:03:37,874 --> 01:03:39,842  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Let's go.
-Captain !

958
01:03:41,677 --> 01:03:44,009  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
One at a time, please!

959
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:48,210  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
We're looking for 2 male, white
suspects in their thirties.

960
01:03:48,284 --> 01:03:51,253  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
We believe them to be of
an Eastern European nationality.

961
01:03:54,991 --> 01:03:56,618  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
That's another lesson.

962
01:03:56,692 --> 01:03:59,525  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
You got nothing to say,
don't waste their time or yours.

963
01:03:59,595 --> 01:04:01,961  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Let somebody else do that.

964
01:04:02,031 --> 01:04:03,157  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
What's the plan now?

965
01:04:03,232 --> 01:04:05,792  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
You're on the team, so I'll
call you when something happens.

966
01:04:05,868 --> 01:04:07,927  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Now I've got to propose
to my girlfriend.

967
01:04:08,004 --> 01:04:10,700  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Really? Congratulations.

968
01:04:10,773 --> 01:04:13,606  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Don't congratulate me.
She hasn't said yes yet.

969
01:04:13,676 --> 01:04:15,610  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I still think
there's something...

970
01:04:15,678 --> 01:04:18,272  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I could be doing
to help find these guys.

971
01:04:18,347 --> 01:04:21,180  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Go home and get some rest.

972
01:04:21,250 --> 01:04:22,547  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Sometimes you can try too hard.

973
01:04:22,618 --> 01:04:25,314  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Sometimes you have to go away
to come back.

974
01:04:25,388 --> 01:04:27,413  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Like you did
with that shot today?

975
01:04:27,490 --> 01:04:28,684  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
That's right.

976
01:04:28,758 --> 01:04:30,521  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
All right. I get it.

977
01:04:30,593 --> 01:04:32,993  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Good, 'cause you don't
look like you get it.

978
01:04:33,062 --> 01:04:34,495  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I get it.

979
01:04:34,563 --> 01:04:36,497  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Sure you get it?
-I get it.

980
01:04:36,565 --> 01:04:38,533  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-You get it?
-No, I get it.

981
01:04:38,601 --> 01:04:41,900  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Trust me. I get it.

982
01:04:44,907 --> 01:04:48,775  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Why don't you keep it? Don't say
I never gave you anything.

983
01:06:11,627 --> 01:06:12,753  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Coming.

984
01:06:27,743 --> 01:06:30,268  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Nick?

985
01:07:15,558 --> 01:07:16,957  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I'm looking for Gayle Cassiopi.

986
01:07:17,026 --> 01:07:18,755  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Cassiopi?
-Cassiopi.

987
01:07:18,828 --> 01:07:20,853  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I think it's one flight up.

988
01:07:20,930 --> 01:07:23,057  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Thanks.

989
01:07:31,540 --> 01:07:32,666  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Action.

990
01:08:23,926 --> 01:08:25,223  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
So.

991
01:08:29,965 --> 01:08:31,398  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Who's she?

992
01:08:31,467 --> 01:08:33,560  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
None of your fucking business.

993
01:08:37,907 --> 01:08:39,670  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Who's Nicky?

994
01:08:53,322 --> 01:08:54,880  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Beautiful.

995
01:08:54,957 --> 01:08:57,050  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
It's OK.

996
01:09:05,868 --> 01:09:09,304  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
You know what I need?
I need your opinion.

997
01:09:09,371 --> 01:09:11,305  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
You do? About what?

998
01:09:15,744 --> 01:09:17,837  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
You see...

999
01:09:17,913 --> 01:09:21,815  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
they're going to make a movie
about me, too, Eddie...

1000
01:09:21,884 --> 01:09:23,715  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
and write books.

1001
01:09:23,786 --> 01:09:26,550  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Write books.

1002
01:09:28,057 --> 01:09:29,251  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
And write books?

1003
01:09:29,325 --> 01:09:30,883  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
What's your fucking
accomplishment?

1004
01:09:33,062 --> 01:09:37,396  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I kill someone famous.

1005
01:09:39,568 --> 01:09:42,731  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
And I saw you...

1006
01:09:42,805 --> 01:09:47,504  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
on the page
of "People" magazine.

1007
01:09:47,576 --> 01:09:49,373  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Eddie, look at me.

1008
01:09:49,445 --> 01:09:52,972  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Good.

1009
01:09:53,048 --> 01:09:56,313  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Good. Be tough to the end.

1010
01:09:56,385 --> 01:09:59,479  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Actor who plays you will
want you to die like a hero.

1011
01:09:59,555 --> 01:10:05,323  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Tabloids don't have
to do reenactments.

1012
01:10:05,394 --> 01:10:09,490  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
They're going to have
a real movie this time.

1013
01:10:09,565 --> 01:10:12,625  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
You film killing me,
you'll get away with that?

1014
01:10:14,169 --> 01:10:15,864  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
You're stupider than I thought.

1015
01:10:15,938 --> 01:10:17,838  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
You're both
out of your fucking minds.

1016
01:10:21,944 --> 01:10:23,104  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Turn it off.

1017
01:10:24,647 --> 01:10:25,773  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Turn it off!

1018
01:10:30,286 --> 01:10:34,052  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
No. We are insane.

1019
01:10:34,123 --> 01:10:39,322  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Who else but crazy men
would film their crimes?

1020
01:10:39,395 --> 01:10:41,727  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
So I kill you...

1021
01:10:41,797 --> 01:10:45,426  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
and if we are caught, we are
sent to mental hospital...

1022
01:10:45,501 --> 01:10:50,438  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
but once I'm in the hospital,
I say I'm not crazy...

1023
01:10:50,506 --> 01:10:56,035  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
just pretended
so I would be acquitted.

1024
01:10:56,111 --> 01:10:58,204  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
We see psychiatrists.

1025
01:10:58,280 --> 01:11:01,215  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
They must certify we are sane...

1026
01:11:01,283 --> 01:11:04,377  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
and because of
your double jeopardy law...

1027
01:11:04,453 --> 01:11:07,217  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
we can't be tried
for the same crime twice.

1028
01:11:07,289 --> 01:11:11,521  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
We come out free,
rich, and famous.

1029
01:11:11,593 --> 01:11:13,527  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
This is a great idea.

1030
01:11:13,595 --> 01:11:15,392  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
This is a fucking great idea.

1031
01:11:15,464 --> 01:11:17,728  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
You think ajury'll
buy that bullshit?

1032
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:19,665  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
You sick fucks.

1033
01:11:37,386 --> 01:11:40,184  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I'm smarter than Americans.

1034
01:11:41,690 --> 01:11:44,921  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
You watch crybaby talk shows
all day long.

1035
01:11:48,230 --> 01:11:50,858  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Not only will
Americans believe me...

1036
01:11:50,933 --> 01:11:53,060  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
they'll cry for me.

1037
01:11:54,636 --> 01:11:56,297  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
So...

1038
01:11:58,574 --> 01:12:00,508  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Detective Eddie Flemming...

1039
01:12:01,810 --> 01:12:06,679  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
would you like to say good-bye
to your Nicky?

1040
01:12:06,749 --> 01:12:10,378  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Maybe you can
propose to her now.

1041
01:12:17,259 --> 01:12:20,353  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
He has nothing to say.

1042
01:12:20,429 --> 01:12:21,691  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Give me a pillow.

1043
01:12:23,365 --> 01:12:25,333  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Give me a fucking pillow!

1044
01:12:31,407 --> 01:12:33,602  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Come here. Start the camera.

1045
01:12:33,675 --> 01:12:36,610  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Cut! This is my project.

1046
01:12:36,678 --> 01:12:39,340  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I'm the director,
and I say action !

1047
01:12:39,415 --> 01:12:40,643  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Shut the fuck up!

1048
01:14:37,733 --> 01:14:40,361  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Detective Flemming
was one of the most decorated...

1049
01:14:40,435 --> 01:14:43,404  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
NYPD detectives
in the history of New York.

1050
01:14:43,472 --> 01:14:45,667  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Among the several thousand
arrests he made...

1051
01:14:45,741 --> 01:14:48,835  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
during his career,
the famed Stephen Geller case.

1052
01:14:48,911 --> 01:14:51,436  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
He was widely loved
by the community he served.

1053
01:14:51,513 --> 01:14:53,538  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
His partner eulogized him.

1054
01:14:53,615 --> 01:14:57,176  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Eddie was my mentor...

1055
01:14:57,252 --> 01:14:59,413  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
my partner...

1056
01:14:59,488 --> 01:15:03,288  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Tragedy.
Every great film must have one.

1057
01:15:03,358 --> 01:15:05,553  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
...the word "friend."

1058
01:15:07,362 --> 01:15:09,455  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I will miss him.

1059
01:15:34,456 --> 01:15:37,289  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I said no. No! No means no.

1060
01:15:37,359 --> 01:15:39,224  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Do you want me to get ugly?

1061
01:15:39,294 --> 01:15:41,194  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Gentlemen, I'm sorry.
It's a private affair.

1062
01:15:41,263 --> 01:15:43,458  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Sorry, no.
-Let me get a drink.

1063
01:17:19,227 --> 01:17:22,526  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Please hold. Just stay on.
Hold on.

1064
01:17:22,597 --> 01:17:25,566  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-You've got a call.
-What are you doing here?

1065
01:17:25,634 --> 01:17:28,398  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Hold on. I'm here.
Just stay there.

1066
01:17:28,470 --> 01:17:30,961  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Don't be ridiculous.
-Trust me. Take this call.

1067
01:17:31,039 --> 01:17:32,973  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Hang up the phone
and get a drink.

1068
01:17:33,041 --> 01:17:35,339  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Take the call. Take it.

1069
01:17:35,410 --> 01:17:36,968  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Give it to me.

1070
01:17:39,047 --> 01:17:41,413  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I'm sorry.

1071
01:17:41,483 --> 01:17:44,384  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Hello? Who is this?

1072
01:17:44,453 --> 01:17:47,752  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I made a movie
of Eddie Flemming's murder.

1073
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:53,757  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
How do I know this is you?

1074
01:17:53,829 --> 01:17:55,763  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
You'll know when you meet me.

1075
01:17:55,831 --> 01:17:59,028  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Where?
-35th and Broadway.

1076
01:17:59,101 --> 01:18:02,593  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Don't bring the police,
or you'll be in next film.

1077
01:18:02,671 --> 01:18:04,832  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Listen, asshole. I've been
threatened by better than you.

1078
01:18:04,906 --> 01:18:08,239  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
No. I'm the best
that's ever threatened you.

1079
01:18:08,310 --> 01:18:09,800  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
They'll get you.

1080
01:18:09,878 --> 01:18:13,177  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
We'll talk about that.

1081
01:18:13,248 --> 01:18:14,772  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
About surrendering?

1082
01:18:14,850 --> 01:18:18,183  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Four o'clock.
It gives you time to go to bank.

1083
01:18:18,253 --> 01:18:20,778  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
One million dollars.

1084
01:18:23,959 --> 01:18:26,928  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Hey, "Top Story."
Are you still there?

1085
01:18:26,995 --> 01:18:30,158  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Yeah. I'm here.
It doesn't work that way.

1086
01:18:30,232 --> 01:18:34,430  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
If you don't want my film,
I'll call another show...

1087
01:18:34,503 --> 01:18:36,494  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
and they will show it.

1088
01:18:42,644 --> 01:18:44,509  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I'll meet you.
I need two things from you--

1089
01:18:44,579 --> 01:18:48,015  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I want exclusivity,
and you will surrender to me.

1090
01:18:50,819 --> 01:18:53,049  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Bring cash.

1091
01:18:58,794 --> 01:19:00,659  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Let's go.

1092
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,764  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Truck 21 spotted
north of the building...

1093
01:19:07,836 --> 01:19:09,770  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
put the aerial ladder
up to the roof.

1094
01:19:09,838 --> 01:19:12,329  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Engine Company 54
and Engine 9...

1095
01:19:12,407 --> 01:19:14,932  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
took hand lines
up to the second level.

1096
01:19:15,010 --> 01:19:18,275  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Truckies cut a hole in the roof
over the fire.

1097
01:19:18,346 --> 01:19:20,143  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
So how was the funeral?

1098
01:19:20,215 --> 01:19:21,614  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Not good.

1099
01:19:21,683 --> 01:19:23,480  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Did the D.A.
videotape her deposition?

1100
01:19:23,552 --> 01:19:25,520  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
He finished a little while ago.

1101
01:19:25,587 --> 01:19:27,521  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Swing by her apartment,
pick up her clothes...

1102
01:19:27,589 --> 01:19:31,389  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
and take her to INS.
She's their problem now.

1103
01:19:31,459 --> 01:19:33,120  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
OK, Chief.

1104
01:20:08,763 --> 01:20:11,755  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Hard to believe. Watch.

1105
01:21:00,148 --> 01:21:02,309  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-What's this?
-I don't know.

1106
01:21:04,686 --> 01:21:06,449  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
"Good luck
with all your troubles.

1107
01:21:06,521 --> 01:21:09,422  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
"I'm here if you need me.
Ludwig."

1108
01:21:11,927 --> 01:21:13,519  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Who's he?

1109
01:21:13,595 --> 01:21:15,654  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
My boss.

1110
01:21:15,730 --> 01:21:17,493  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Why, are you jealous?

1111
01:21:20,035 --> 01:21:22,162  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Why don't we get your stuff?

1112
01:21:49,898 --> 01:21:52,389  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Look...

1113
01:21:53,435 --> 01:21:55,665  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
you're a witness
to a double homicide.

1114
01:21:55,737 --> 01:21:58,001  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I can't get involved with you.

1115
01:22:01,476 --> 01:22:03,637  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
All right?

1116
01:22:03,712 --> 01:22:08,149  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Why don't you go get your bags,
and I'll wait here?

1117
01:22:08,216 --> 01:22:10,514  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Are you all right?

1118
01:22:10,585 --> 01:22:13,179  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Yeah, I'm fine.

1119
01:22:29,070 --> 01:22:30,196  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Get back!

1120
01:22:34,476 --> 01:22:35,807  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
No! That's not mine!

1121
01:22:45,620 --> 01:22:47,212  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Get back!

1122
01:22:53,094 --> 01:22:54,721  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
No! Don't do it!

1123
01:22:58,199 --> 01:22:59,996  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Come on !

1124
01:23:02,837 --> 01:23:05,772  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Hurry! Hurry!

1125
01:23:11,980 --> 01:23:13,914  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-It's locked.
-Where's the key?

1126
01:23:13,982 --> 01:23:16,109  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-It's not mine.
-Get in the bathroom.

1127
01:23:20,588 --> 01:23:23,216  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
10-75! 47th and 8th !

1128
01:23:23,291 --> 01:23:25,452  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
We're trapped!
Two alarms on arrival!

1129
01:23:27,595 --> 01:23:30,155  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Oh, my God.

1130
01:23:30,231 --> 01:23:32,529  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
He's nailed it down.

1131
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:35,467  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Don't open the window.
It'll suck the fire towards us.

1132
01:23:41,676 --> 01:23:42,973  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
They were here.

1133
01:23:43,044 --> 01:23:45,239  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Jesus Christ. That's Eddie's.

1134
01:23:45,313 --> 01:23:47,008  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
They were here!

1135
01:23:47,082 --> 01:23:50,108  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Calm down, Daphne.
Just get in the tub.

1136
01:23:52,153 --> 01:23:54,280  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-There's gasoline.
-What?

1137
01:23:54,355 --> 01:23:57,381  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-What are you doing?
-I'm pouring it out.

1138
01:23:57,459 --> 01:23:59,484  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-It's not going down.
-Oh, my God.

1139
01:24:03,331 --> 01:24:04,696  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Give it to me.

1140
01:24:06,167 --> 01:24:07,862  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Jesus Christ, it's clogged!

1141
01:24:07,936 --> 01:24:10,029  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Please do something.
We're going to die.

1142
01:24:11,806 --> 01:24:13,831  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Forget it. They're all clogged.

1143
01:24:13,908 --> 01:24:15,876  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Just stay low and stay calm.
-Do something!

1144
01:24:15,944 --> 01:24:17,343  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Just stay low!

1145
01:24:49,844 --> 01:24:53,871  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Ninety percent people who die
in a fire die from eating smoke.

1146
01:24:53,948 --> 01:24:56,416  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Let me introduce you
to my partner...

1147
01:24:56,484 --> 01:24:58,850  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
and the man
who started the fire.

1148
01:24:58,920 --> 01:25:00,751  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Emil.

1149
01:25:02,924 --> 01:25:07,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Emil, say something
for your fans, huh?

1150
01:25:10,765 --> 01:25:13,165  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Stand back and get down !
Stay low.

1151
01:25:15,737 --> 01:25:17,500  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Stay low!

1152
01:25:28,683 --> 01:25:31,015  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
This'll buy us some time!

1153
01:25:48,503 --> 01:25:51,028  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Get back!

1154
01:25:56,277 --> 01:25:57,972  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
This is a great film.

1155
01:25:58,046 --> 01:26:02,176  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
We can see fire right now,
and Daphne's in the fire.

1156
01:26:09,958 --> 01:26:11,619  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Tell him it's OK.

1157
01:26:18,032 --> 01:26:19,431  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Got to go!

1158
01:26:39,787 --> 01:26:41,084  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Come on, guys. Let's go.

1159
01:26:58,740 --> 01:27:00,503  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Take care of the boy.

1160
01:27:02,143 --> 01:27:04,270  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
And get her some oxygen !

1161
01:27:09,984 --> 01:27:12,782  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-You all right?
-What happened up there?

1162
01:27:12,854 --> 01:27:15,823  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
It was a setup. Somebody
booby-trapped the apartment.

1163
01:27:15,890 --> 01:27:18,484  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Who?
-Got to be the same guys.

1164
01:27:18,559 --> 01:27:21,323  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Speak louder. I can't hear you.

1165
01:27:21,396 --> 01:27:23,557  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Jordy, are you hurt?
-I'm all right.

1166
01:27:23,631 --> 01:27:27,067  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
What? You have to speak up.

1167
01:27:27,135 --> 01:27:29,899  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
What the hell
are you talking about?

1168
01:27:29,971 --> 01:27:32,769  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
What is it?

1169
01:27:42,317 --> 01:27:45,252  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Where's Hawkins?
-He's not on the premises.

1170
01:27:45,320 --> 01:27:47,880  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Bring that tape here right now!

1171
01:27:47,955 --> 01:27:50,185  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Any request for that tape
has to go to our attorney!

1172
01:27:50,258 --> 01:27:53,352  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I am begging you !
You can't let this happen !

1173
01:27:53,428 --> 01:27:56,295  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
You want that tape,
contact the attorney.

1174
01:27:56,364 --> 01:27:57,729  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
You think we're joking?

1175
01:27:57,799 --> 01:27:58,925  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Back off, man !

1176
01:28:00,201 --> 01:28:03,227  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
You can't do this!
Don't do this to Eddie.

1177
01:28:03,304 --> 01:28:05,568  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Don't do it to the people
of this city.

1178
01:28:05,640 --> 01:28:07,335  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
You can't show
the man's murder on TV!

1179
01:28:07,408 --> 01:28:10,400  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
You want the tape, there it is.

1180
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:15,074  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Stay tuned for a special edition
of "Top Story."

1181
01:28:15,149 --> 01:28:18,482  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Detective Eddie Flemming's
brutal murder was videotaped...

1182
01:28:18,553 --> 01:28:22,011  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
and we will broadcast it
after these messages.

1183
01:28:22,090 --> 01:28:24,524  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Hard to believe. Watch.

1184
01:28:46,550 --> 01:28:48,916  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Who says you can't be success
in America?

1185
01:28:48,986 --> 01:28:51,955  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I came here with nothing,
knowing nobody.

1186
01:28:52,022 --> 01:28:54,684  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
And now, look.

1187
01:28:55,759 --> 01:28:57,226  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I am success story.

1188
01:29:01,966 --> 01:29:06,630  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Emil, why did you say "I"?
It should be "we."

1189
01:29:06,704 --> 01:29:09,969  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Don't be paranoid.
I gave you half.

1190
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:12,600  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I'm Robert Hawkins,
and this is "Top Story."

1191
01:29:12,676 --> 01:29:13,973  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Here we are.

1192
01:29:14,044 --> 01:29:16,512  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Tonight I present material of
a graphic and violent nature...

1193
01:29:16,580 --> 01:29:19,242  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
never before
seen on television.

1194
01:29:19,316 --> 01:29:22,114  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I do so with a heavy heart.

1195
01:29:22,186 --> 01:29:23,585  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
It would only be normal
to ask...

1196
01:29:23,654 --> 01:29:26,122  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
why are we showing something
so disturbing?

1197
01:29:26,190 --> 01:29:28,920  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
My answer is,
as ajournalist...

1198
01:29:28,993 --> 01:29:30,927  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I am obligated to show it.

1199
01:29:30,995 --> 01:29:35,659  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I air this tape in loving memory
of my friend Eddie Flemming.

1200
01:29:35,733 --> 01:29:38,361  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Hard to believe.

1201
01:29:41,305 --> 01:29:42,397  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Watch.

1202
01:29:42,473 --> 01:29:45,442  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
You film killing me,
you'll get away with that?

1203
01:29:47,611 --> 01:29:49,909  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Turn it off. Just turn it off.

1204
01:29:49,980 --> 01:29:52,244  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Cut! This is my project.

1205
01:29:52,316 --> 01:29:54,910  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I'm the director,
and I say action.

1206
01:29:54,985 --> 01:29:56,111  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Shut the--up!

1207
01:30:31,021 --> 01:30:33,455  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Why did you leave that in
about being a director?

1208
01:30:33,524 --> 01:30:35,958  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Because I am the director.
-What?

1209
01:30:36,026 --> 01:30:40,895  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Don't you fucking realize that
if it wasn't for my idea...

1210
01:30:40,964 --> 01:30:42,864  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
no fucking way
we'd be sitting here right now?

1211
01:30:42,933 --> 01:30:45,265  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Your idea?
-My idea.

1212
01:30:45,335 --> 01:30:47,132  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Is that the guy?

1213
01:30:48,572 --> 01:30:49,971  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Don't you understand?

1214
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:52,565  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
This is a great American movie,
and who made it?

1215
01:30:52,643 --> 01:30:55,009  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I made it all.
I was the director.

1216
01:30:55,079 --> 01:30:57,946  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Who are you?
-I am everything.

1217
01:30:58,015 --> 01:31:01,382  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
This is what America wants--
violence and sex.

1218
01:31:01,452 --> 01:31:06,583  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Before we hand in the next
video, I'll put titles on it.

1219
01:31:06,657 --> 01:31:11,253  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
And my credit will read,
"Directed by Oleg Razgul."

1220
01:31:11,328 --> 01:31:14,422  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
But there is only one problem.

1221
01:31:14,498 --> 01:31:17,399  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
One credit,
but I don't share credit.

1222
01:31:17,468 --> 01:31:18,696  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
You got it?

1223
01:31:19,770 --> 01:31:21,635  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
You think you're a director?

1224
01:31:21,705 --> 01:31:27,735  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
You're just a little, small,
Russian piece of shit.

1225
01:31:44,161 --> 01:31:46,493  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
This is Robert Hawkins
for "Top Story."

1226
01:31:46,563 --> 01:31:49,396  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
We'll be back after this.

1227
01:31:49,466 --> 01:31:51,832  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
All right, I'm here. Jesus.

1228
01:31:51,902 --> 01:31:53,529  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
This is the man
I told you about.

1229
01:31:53,604 --> 01:31:55,902  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
This is Bruce Cutler.

1230
01:31:55,973 --> 01:31:58,840  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Bryan, come get this from here.

1231
01:31:58,909 --> 01:32:02,242  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I am Emil. I'm insane.

1232
01:32:02,312 --> 01:32:05,839  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Are you my lawyer?
-Not just yet.

1233
01:32:05,916 --> 01:32:07,975  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I got your money.

1234
01:32:13,023 --> 01:32:15,355  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Where is it?

1235
01:32:15,425 --> 01:32:19,794  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Shit, where is it?

1236
01:32:19,863 --> 01:32:21,854  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
He's got the camera!
He's got the movie!

1237
01:32:21,932 --> 01:32:24,799  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Let's sit down
and talk a minute.

1238
01:32:24,868 --> 01:32:26,301  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Don't move!

1239
01:32:26,370 --> 01:32:28,804  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Get your hands up
and drop the gun !

1240
01:32:28,872 --> 01:32:30,703  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Drop the goddamn gun !

1241
01:32:33,243 --> 01:32:34,767  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
What did you hit him for?
He surrendered!

1242
01:32:34,845 --> 01:32:35,937  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Go tight on them.

1243
01:32:36,013 --> 01:32:38,948  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
He's unarmed and hurt!
Emil, I'm going with you.

1244
01:32:39,016 --> 01:32:40,347  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Come on !

1245
01:32:40,417 --> 01:32:43,352  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I'm coming down there with you.
I'm his lawyer.

1246
01:32:43,420 --> 01:32:46,014  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Turn the camera off!
-Keep rolling!

1247
01:32:46,089 --> 01:32:49,058  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Keep filming! Keep filming!

1248
01:32:49,126 --> 01:32:51,788  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-I'm invoking his rights!
-What's going on?

1249
01:32:51,862 --> 01:32:52,954  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I'm going with you, Emil.

1250
01:32:53,030 --> 01:32:54,622  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Fuck!

1251
01:32:54,698 --> 01:32:56,097  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Emil, I'm going down there
with you.

1252
01:32:56,166 --> 01:32:59,465  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-What's going on?!
-They'll take you downtown.

1253
01:32:59,536 --> 01:33:02,198  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-I'll take him.
-No! He's mine!

1254
01:33:02,272 --> 01:33:03,398  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Don't argue with me.

1255
01:33:03,473 --> 01:33:05,441  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-He's my collar!
-He killed my partner!

1256
01:33:05,509 --> 01:33:07,841  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
After he's booked, he's yours,
but I'm walking him in !

1257
01:33:07,911 --> 01:33:11,472  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
All right, have your 15 minutes.
Tommy, ride with him.

1258
01:33:11,548 --> 01:33:13,982  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Get in the fucking car.

1259
01:33:14,051 --> 01:33:15,541  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Don't speak to him!

1260
01:33:17,421 --> 01:33:20,288  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Put your head in !
Get him in the car!

1261
01:33:20,357 --> 01:33:22,518  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Put your head in, you fool!

1262
01:33:24,261 --> 01:33:27,560  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
You ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

1263
01:33:27,631 --> 01:33:32,193  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Bullshit, Leon !
I got him off the streets!

1264
01:33:32,269 --> 01:33:35,830  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Bravo, Mr. Hawkins!
-Back off.

1265
01:33:35,906 --> 01:33:37,237  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
You are sick!

1266
01:33:37,307 --> 01:33:38,433  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I'm fed up with
your fucking bullshit!

1267
01:33:38,508 --> 01:33:40,567  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
That is crap, and you know it!

1268
01:33:44,047 --> 01:33:45,776  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Get out of here!

1269
01:33:50,020 --> 01:33:52,113  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Jordy, where are you going?

1270
01:33:52,189 --> 01:33:54,089  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
You're going to lose everybody!

1271
01:33:54,157 --> 01:33:55,590  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
What are you doing?

1272
01:33:55,659 --> 01:33:57,490  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
This is not the way
to the station !

1273
01:34:10,841 --> 01:34:13,071  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Talk to me! You're losing them!

1274
01:34:13,143 --> 01:34:14,610  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Answer me, man !

1275
01:34:42,105 --> 01:34:44,039  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Answer me!
-Where am l?

1276
01:34:44,107 --> 01:34:46,974  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-What the hell--
-What's going on?

1277
01:34:47,044 --> 01:34:50,036  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Hold on. Jordy, wait!

1278
01:34:50,113 --> 01:34:51,546  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Come on !

1279
01:34:51,615 --> 01:34:56,018  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Where's my lawyer?
-God damn it!

1280
01:34:56,086 --> 01:34:58,384  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
What's wrong with you? Shit!

1281
01:34:58,455 --> 01:35:01,822  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Fuck you ! What's going on?

1282
01:35:01,892 --> 01:35:03,757  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Wait a minute!

1283
01:35:03,827 --> 01:35:06,091  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Jordy, you can't do this!

1284
01:35:06,163 --> 01:35:08,256  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Listen !
-Get out of the way!

1285
01:35:11,835 --> 01:35:14,463  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Jordy, listen, man, please!

1286
01:35:14,538 --> 01:35:18,565  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
How'd you know how
to rig that apartment?

1287
01:35:18,642 --> 01:35:21,110  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
My father was a fireman.

1288
01:35:21,178 --> 01:35:23,874  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
He taught me about fire.
Now it's my friend.

1289
01:35:23,947 --> 01:35:25,915  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Take a walk.
-You're not thinking straight.

1290
01:35:25,982 --> 01:35:28,109  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
He knew he'd get caught.

1291
01:35:28,185 --> 01:35:30,085  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
That's why
you taped Eddie's murder!

1292
01:35:30,153 --> 01:35:32,644  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I want this son
of a bitch dead, too.

1293
01:35:32,723 --> 01:35:34,350  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
You can't kill him
in cold blood!

1294
01:35:34,424 --> 01:35:37,325  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Get the hell out of here!
Get in the car!

1295
01:35:37,394 --> 01:35:41,421  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Listen to me!
I won't let you do this!

1296
01:35:41,498 --> 01:35:44,058  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Tommy, get in the car and go!

1297
01:35:44,134 --> 01:35:45,499  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Now go!

1298
01:35:45,569 --> 01:35:48,868  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Fuck it, man ! Shit!

1299
01:35:48,939 --> 01:35:51,305  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Something fucking funny?

1300
01:35:51,375 --> 01:35:53,206  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Refreshing.

1301
01:35:53,276 --> 01:35:55,938  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
You think this is funny?

1302
01:35:56,012 --> 01:35:57,946  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Turn around!

1303
01:35:58,014 --> 01:35:59,538  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
You want to be famous?

1304
01:35:59,616 --> 01:36:01,083  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
You want headlines?

1305
01:36:02,686 --> 01:36:04,449  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
All right, now's your chance.

1306
01:36:04,521 --> 01:36:06,250  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Put your hands up.

1307
01:36:06,323 --> 01:36:08,518  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Get your goddamn hands up!

1308
01:36:09,659 --> 01:36:12,253  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Turn around.

1309
01:36:12,329 --> 01:36:14,524  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
You want to be
a real American, right?

1310
01:36:14,598 --> 01:36:15,690  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Want to be a tough guy?

1311
01:36:15,766 --> 01:36:19,167  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Here's Eddie's gun.
Remember him?

1312
01:36:26,143 --> 01:36:28,543  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
You want to be famous? Shoot me.

1313
01:36:28,612 --> 01:36:32,810  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Want headlines? Money?
Celebrity? Shoot me!

1314
01:36:35,018 --> 01:36:38,852  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
You can't kill me.
You're not a cop.

1315
01:36:38,922 --> 01:36:40,947  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
You're just a fireman
with a gun.

1316
01:36:43,894 --> 01:36:47,830  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I'll make it easy.

1317
01:37:04,648 --> 01:37:12,054  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
You Americans are pussies
without your missiles and money.

1318
01:37:12,122 --> 01:37:14,750  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
You won't kill me.

1319
01:37:15,892 --> 01:37:18,019  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
You don't have the balls.

1320
01:37:36,213 --> 01:37:38,408  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Don't do it, brother!

1321
01:37:38,482 --> 01:37:40,746  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Kill me.

1322
01:37:40,817 --> 01:37:42,876  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Get up!

1323
01:37:42,953 --> 01:37:45,444  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
You're mine now, sucker!

1324
01:37:45,522 --> 01:37:47,422  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
You are out of control,
you know that?

1325
01:37:47,491 --> 01:37:49,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Here's Eddie's gun.

1326
01:37:51,094 --> 01:37:53,619  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Where you going?

1327
01:37:53,697 --> 01:37:55,562  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I lost my shoe.

1328
01:37:55,632 --> 01:37:56,894  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I want my shoe.

1329
01:37:56,967 --> 01:37:58,935  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Get him out of here!

1330
01:38:05,075 --> 01:38:07,543  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Emil Slovak is a victim here.

1331
01:38:07,611 --> 01:38:09,169  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
He is not a culprit.

1332
01:38:09,246 --> 01:38:12,477  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
We all appreciate the tragedy
of Detective Flemming's death.

1333
01:38:12,549 --> 01:38:14,346  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I represent Mr. Slovak.

1334
01:38:14,417 --> 01:38:17,978  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
He was operating under
the influence of his partner.

1335
01:38:18,054 --> 01:38:20,113  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
This will all come out
at the trial...

1336
01:38:20,190 --> 01:38:21,919  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
and Emil will be vindicated.

1337
01:38:21,992 --> 01:38:23,357  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I will see to that.

1338
01:38:25,595 --> 01:38:27,688  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Good job.
-Thanks.

1339
01:38:27,764 --> 01:38:29,823  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
How you feeling?

1340
01:38:29,900 --> 01:38:31,663  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I brought letters.

1341
01:38:31,735 --> 01:38:35,296  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Fan mail from women.
One wants to buy you a suit...

1342
01:38:35,372 --> 01:38:38,239  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
another sent money,
and another one wants money.

1343
01:38:38,308 --> 01:38:40,276  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Did you bring cigarettes?
-I did.

1344
01:38:42,812 --> 01:38:46,373  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
The perception out there
is very bad right now.

1345
01:38:46,449 --> 01:38:48,246  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
And perception is reality.

1346
01:38:48,318 --> 01:38:49,785  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
You may not be crazy...

1347
01:38:49,853 --> 01:38:53,118  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
but I want to get
that message out now.

1348
01:38:53,189 --> 01:38:55,157  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
That's our only defense
in this case.

1349
01:38:55,225 --> 01:38:57,625  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
You have to focus
on three things...

1350
01:38:57,694 --> 01:39:00,185  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
paranoia, fear, and delusions.

1351
01:39:00,263 --> 01:39:01,855  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I was all of those.

1352
01:39:01,932 --> 01:39:05,800  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
But you never appreciated
the severity of it until now.

1353
01:39:05,869 --> 01:39:07,427  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Of course not. How could l?

1354
01:39:07,504 --> 01:39:10,132  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I was paranoid, fearful,
and deluded.

1355
01:39:13,443 --> 01:39:15,468  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Now, what about Oleg?

1356
01:39:15,545 --> 01:39:18,070  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
They're looking
all over for him.

1357
01:39:18,148 --> 01:39:21,845  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Haven't found him.
Maybe he went back to Russia.

1358
01:39:21,918 --> 01:39:23,852  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
No, he's here.

1359
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:25,387  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Let's forget about him
and focus on you.

1360
01:39:25,455 --> 01:39:27,423  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
You're what's most important.

1361
01:39:27,490 --> 01:39:32,154  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
What about my movie rights?
Book rights?

1362
01:39:32,228 --> 01:39:34,196  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
For you?

1363
01:39:34,264 --> 01:39:37,961  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I have not thought about that.

1364
01:39:38,034 --> 01:39:40,628  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
How much do you want?
What's your cut?

1365
01:39:42,072 --> 01:39:46,168  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I think we could be partners.
Fifty-fifty.

1366
01:39:46,242 --> 01:39:48,233  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
No. No way.

1367
01:39:48,311 --> 01:39:50,006  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Thirty percent, no more.

1368
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:51,604  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
We're in it together.

1369
01:39:51,681 --> 01:39:53,376  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I thought forty percent
might be all right.

1370
01:39:53,450 --> 01:39:55,850  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Oh, my God! No.

1371
01:39:55,919 --> 01:39:57,944  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Thirty,
or I call another lawyer.

1372
01:39:58,021 --> 01:39:59,955  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
This is the biggest case
of your life.

1373
01:40:00,023 --> 01:40:03,151  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Don't try to negotiate.
Say yes or no.

1374
01:40:07,564 --> 01:40:10,624  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I can live with thirty percent.

1375
01:40:10,700 --> 01:40:13,498  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
It's important you understand
this is not all about money.

1376
01:40:13,570 --> 01:40:15,128  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
What else do you need?

1377
01:40:15,205 --> 01:40:19,039  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I need to know about you,
what makes you tick.

1378
01:40:19,109 --> 01:40:21,043  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I need to know your background.

1379
01:40:21,111 --> 01:40:24,308  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Your mother, father, brother,
sister, everything.

1380
01:40:24,381 --> 01:40:28,078  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
That's what I need to know.

1381
01:40:28,151 --> 01:40:31,814  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
My father always degraded me.

1382
01:40:31,888 --> 01:40:33,253  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
He killed my self-esteem.

1383
01:40:33,323 --> 01:40:37,123  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
He hated me from the day
when I was born.

1384
01:40:41,631 --> 01:40:44,566  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Emil Slovak will appear
in court today.

1385
01:40:44,634 --> 01:40:46,226  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
His lawyer--

1386
01:40:46,302 --> 01:40:48,463  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Stay focused. Start again.

1387
01:40:49,906 --> 01:40:52,704  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Emil Slovak
will appear in court today.

1388
01:40:52,776 --> 01:40:57,839  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
His lawyer will argue that
his client is mentally unfit...

1389
01:40:57,914 --> 01:40:59,711  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
This is such bullshit.

1390
01:40:59,783 --> 01:41:01,751  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
In a related matter...

1391
01:41:01,818 --> 01:41:04,184  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Mr. Slovak's attorney,
Bruce Cutler...

1392
01:41:04,254 --> 01:41:07,280  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
famous for handling
sensational cases...

1393
01:41:07,357 --> 01:41:10,656  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
claims his client is unfit
to stand trial.

1394
01:41:10,727 --> 01:41:12,251  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Bobby, give me a break.

1395
01:41:13,296 --> 01:41:16,026  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Hello? No, not you, hon.

1396
01:41:16,099 --> 01:41:19,159  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Hello?
No, we have no comment.

1397
01:41:19,235 --> 01:41:22,102  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
...his partner Oleg Razgul,
who threatened to kill him...

1398
01:41:22,172 --> 01:41:23,571  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
if he didn't follow his orders.

1399
01:41:23,640 --> 01:41:26,507  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I got to go!

1400
01:41:26,576 --> 01:41:28,908  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I'm going back to
the Czech Republic...

1401
01:41:28,978 --> 01:41:32,414  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
to face the charges against me.
I'm innocent.

1402
01:41:32,482 --> 01:41:34,347  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
If she shot a cop
who raped her sister...

1403
01:41:34,417 --> 01:41:36,647  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
in this country,
she'd be a hero.

1404
01:41:37,821 --> 01:41:40,221  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I approached him and asked
for some spare change.

1405
01:41:40,290 --> 01:41:41,848  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Politely, right?

1406
01:41:41,925 --> 01:41:44,860  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Whereupon he pulls out
his big gun...

1407
01:41:44,928 --> 01:41:48,762  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
pushed me up in the tree,
handcuffs me like this...

1408
01:41:48,832 --> 01:41:50,663  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
and then he takes my money.

1409
01:41:50,734 --> 01:41:53,931  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Left me here
exposed to all the elements.

1410
01:41:54,003 --> 01:41:57,632  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Un-fucking-believable.
Look at this fucking guy.

1411
01:41:57,707 --> 01:42:00,107  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Kids, if you out there...

1412
01:42:00,176 --> 01:42:02,872  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
don't hate your firemen.

1413
01:42:02,946 --> 01:42:04,573  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Not all fire marshals like this.

1414
01:42:04,647 --> 01:42:07,548  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
It's not like this,
so keep the love.

1415
01:42:10,053 --> 01:42:12,578  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Hard to believe.
You're watching "Top Story."

1416
01:42:12,655 --> 01:42:15,385  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
How could you forget handcuffing
a civilian to a tree...

1417
01:42:15,458 --> 01:42:18,427  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
in Central Park
in the middle of the night?

1418
01:42:18,495 --> 01:42:20,759  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Chief, I know I screwed up...

1419
01:42:20,830 --> 01:42:22,764  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
but this guy is not
some innocent civilian.

1420
01:42:22,832 --> 01:42:25,164  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
He'll end your career
and probably mine!

1421
01:42:25,235 --> 01:42:26,964  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
End my career?

1422
01:42:27,036 --> 01:42:29,630  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
The press will be all over us!

1423
01:42:29,706 --> 01:42:31,333  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Get the fuck back to your desks!

1424
01:42:31,407 --> 01:42:33,637  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Chief, look at my file.

1425
01:42:33,710 --> 01:42:37,146  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I've never had a complaint.
I crack big cases.

1426
01:42:37,213 --> 01:42:39,681  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Your record doesn't matter!
-It should!

1427
01:42:39,749 --> 01:42:43,241  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Past history! Don't you get it?

1428
01:42:43,319 --> 01:42:47,483  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I'm sorry. It's unfortunate
I have to make decisions...

1429
01:42:47,557 --> 01:42:50,924  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
based on your press coverage,
but I do.

1430
01:42:50,994 --> 01:42:53,519  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
You're suspended without pay...

1431
01:42:53,596 --> 01:42:55,530  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
pending a department trial.

1432
01:42:55,598 --> 01:42:58,499  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Not to mention
your criminal charges.

1433
01:42:58,568 --> 01:43:00,536  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
That's not right.

1434
01:43:00,603 --> 01:43:02,628  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Just get yourself
a damn good lawyer.

1435
01:43:45,381 --> 01:43:47,542  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
...over a million dollars
for the disputed video.

1436
01:43:47,617 --> 01:43:51,144  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
In related news, Emil Slovak
is back in court tomorrow...

1437
01:43:51,221 --> 01:43:55,351  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
where we'll learn if
he is competent to stand trial.

1438
01:43:55,425 --> 01:43:59,054  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Meanwhile, the massive manhunt
continues for Oleg Razgul...

1439
01:43:59,128 --> 01:44:03,087  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
the alleged mastermind behind
the murder of Eddie Flemming.

1440
01:44:03,166 --> 01:44:06,397  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
"Action News" has learned that
Slovak won't have to worry...

1441
01:44:06,469 --> 01:44:08,460  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
about how
to pay for his defense.

1442
01:44:08,538 --> 01:44:10,597  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
He has received movie offers...

1443
01:44:10,673 --> 01:44:13,642  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
and has been in conversations
with publishers...

1444
01:44:13,710 --> 01:44:15,769  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
concerning the rights
to his story.

1445
01:44:18,214 --> 01:44:19,977  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Further developments
are expected today...

1446
01:44:20,049 --> 01:44:22,176  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
in the bizarre Eddie Flemming
murder case.

1447
01:44:22,252 --> 01:44:24,652  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Judge Stanley Stern
will issue his ruling...

1448
01:44:24,721 --> 01:44:28,122  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
on alleged killer
Emil Slovak's insanity plea.

1449
01:44:28,191 --> 01:44:29,590  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
If the court rules
in his favor today...

1450
01:44:29,659 --> 01:44:32,526  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Mr. Slovak will be transferred
to the psych ward...

1451
01:44:32,595 --> 01:44:36,053  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
at Rikers lsland before
being remanded to the custody...

1452
01:44:36,132 --> 01:44:38,532  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
of a permanent institution
for the mentally ill.

1453
01:44:38,601 --> 01:44:41,161  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Slovak's attorney
Bruce Cutler has maintained...

1454
01:44:41,237 --> 01:44:43,933  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
an abusive childhood is to blame
for his client's actions.

1455
01:44:44,007 --> 01:44:46,635  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
The Czech national
apparently has a history...

1456
01:44:46,709 --> 01:44:50,668  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
of physical and emotional trauma
from an alcoholic father.

1457
01:44:59,589 --> 01:45:02,023  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
What's ever left over, keep it.

1458
01:45:02,091 --> 01:45:03,558  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Thanks, buddy.

1459
01:45:20,977 --> 01:45:23,571  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Keep the Statue of Liberty
in the background.

1460
01:45:23,646 --> 01:45:25,614  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-How do I look?
-Beautiful.

1461
01:45:25,682 --> 01:45:28,150  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Thanks. Fuck you. Roll.

1462
01:45:28,217 --> 01:45:30,117  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
What are you looking at?

1463
01:45:31,187 --> 01:45:32,848  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Forget about him. Let's go.

1464
01:45:32,922 --> 01:45:34,583  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
All right. Just roll.

1465
01:45:38,428 --> 01:45:39,986  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
All right. Let's go.

1466
01:45:40,063 --> 01:45:42,588  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Bruce Cutler,
do you have a statement for us?

1467
01:45:42,665 --> 01:45:45,395  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
It's been a difficult
and long day for us.

1468
01:45:45,468 --> 01:45:48,926  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Emil has been found
incompetent to stand trial.

1469
01:45:49,005 --> 01:45:54,136  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
In times of extreme stress,
as a result of delusions...

1470
01:45:54,210 --> 01:45:57,611  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
he could not appreciate
the wrongfulness of his acts...

1471
01:45:57,680 --> 01:46:00,808  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
and therefore
he's not liable for his acts.

1472
01:46:00,883 --> 01:46:04,683  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
This is a victory
for the mentally ill...

1473
01:46:04,754 --> 01:46:07,348  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
and before Emil
is taken on the boat...

1474
01:46:07,423 --> 01:46:11,086  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
to the psychiatric ward
at Rikers lsland...

1475
01:46:11,160 --> 01:46:13,355  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
it should be noted
that what he did...

1476
01:46:13,429 --> 01:46:17,388  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
he was forced to do
by Oleg Razgul...

1477
01:46:17,467 --> 01:46:21,927  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
a dangerous and demented
individual at liberty now...

1478
01:46:22,005 --> 01:46:25,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
in the streets of New York,
and both Emil and l...

1479
01:46:25,308 --> 01:46:28,300  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Iook forward to when
he is brought to justice.

1480
01:46:29,746 --> 01:46:32,044  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
What are you looking at,
you piece of shit?

1481
01:46:32,115 --> 01:46:35,243  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Officers, watch him.
He assaulted my client.

1482
01:46:35,318 --> 01:46:37,377  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
That's it? This scumbag
kills Eddie Flemming...

1483
01:46:37,453 --> 01:46:39,944  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
and spends the rest of his life
in a country club nuthouse?

1484
01:46:40,023 --> 01:46:43,186  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
What about the victims?
What about the families?

1485
01:46:43,259 --> 01:46:46,057  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Marshal,
I understand you don't agree...

1486
01:46:46,129 --> 01:46:48,962  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
but this is
the system and the law.

1487
01:46:50,600 --> 01:46:51,692  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Let's go.

1488
01:46:51,768 --> 01:46:54,032  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I can kill you. I'm insane.

1489
01:46:55,505 --> 01:46:57,735  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
We need this area cleared.
Move back.

1490
01:47:00,443 --> 01:47:03,276  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Two-shot of Cutler and Slovak.
All right.

1491
01:47:03,346 --> 01:47:04,506  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Give me the boat
in the background.

1492
01:47:06,682 --> 01:47:09,116  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Emil knew exactly
what he was doing.

1493
01:47:09,185 --> 01:47:10,482  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Watch this.

1494
01:47:10,553 --> 01:47:12,384  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
All right.

1495
01:47:19,595 --> 01:47:20,687  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Turn it off.

1496
01:47:20,763 --> 01:47:22,628  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
This tape I kept for myself.

1497
01:47:26,269 --> 01:47:28,794  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
In hospital
I say I'm not crazy...

1498
01:47:28,871 --> 01:47:31,362  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
and because of
your double jeopardy law...

1499
01:47:31,441 --> 01:47:34,171  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
we can't be tried
for the same crime twice.

1500
01:47:34,243 --> 01:47:37,804  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
We come out
free, rich, and famous.

1501
01:47:37,880 --> 01:47:40,110  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Can we deal for this?

1502
01:47:44,620 --> 01:47:46,747  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
It's free.

1503
01:47:46,823 --> 01:47:49,690  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Bruce! What would you
say to evidence...

1504
01:47:49,759 --> 01:47:51,852  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
that proves your client
is not insane?

1505
01:47:51,928 --> 01:47:55,694  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
"Top Story" has the truth
from Oleg Razgul himself.

1506
01:47:55,765 --> 01:47:58,700  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
You knew what you were doing.

1507
01:47:58,768 --> 01:48:00,793  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
It's all in my movie.

1508
01:48:00,870 --> 01:48:03,395  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Officers, do your duty
and arrest this man.

1509
01:48:03,473 --> 01:48:06,340  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I'm not the killer.
I'm the director. Action !

1510
01:48:13,683 --> 01:48:15,674  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Back off!
-Let her go!

1511
01:48:15,751 --> 01:48:18,618  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Everyone, back away from me!
Tell him to put his gun down !

1512
01:48:18,688 --> 01:48:20,656  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Do not fire your weapons!

1513
01:48:20,723 --> 01:48:22,987  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Stay back!
-Nobody's going to fire.

1514
01:48:23,059 --> 01:48:24,424  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Hold that line!
-Let her go!

1515
01:48:24,494 --> 01:48:27,622  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Tell him to put his gun down.
Stay back!

1516
01:48:27,697 --> 01:48:30,257  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Get that shotgun out of here!
-Stay back!

1517
01:48:30,333 --> 01:48:32,301  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Nobody's firing.
Everybody, get back!

1518
01:48:32,368 --> 01:48:35,030  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Do not fire, anyone!
Lower those weapons!

1519
01:48:35,104 --> 01:48:36,537  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Now! Lower!

1520
01:48:36,606 --> 01:48:37,937  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Tell him to put his gun down !

1521
01:48:38,007 --> 01:48:39,770  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Let her go!

1522
01:48:39,842 --> 01:48:41,434  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
If he doesn't lower his gun,
I'll fucking kill her!

1523
01:48:41,511 --> 01:48:43,775  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Officer, lower that weapon !

1524
01:48:43,846 --> 01:48:45,780  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Remember Eddie!
-Shut up!

1525
01:48:45,848 --> 01:48:47,145  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Do not fire that weapon !

1526
01:48:47,216 --> 01:48:50,811  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
I'll surrender
if he lowers his gun !

1527
01:48:50,887 --> 01:48:53,617  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Don't you let
this piece of shit surrender!

1528
01:48:53,689 --> 01:48:55,554  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
If you don't let me surrender,
I kill her now.

1529
01:48:55,625 --> 01:48:57,786  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I don't care!

1530
01:48:57,860 --> 01:49:00,192  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-Do not fire that weapon !
-Shut up!

1531
01:49:00,263 --> 01:49:03,289  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Jordy, God damn it!
You take that fucking shot!

1532
01:49:03,366 --> 01:49:06,426  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Officer, for the last time,
lower your weapon !

1533
01:49:10,206 --> 01:49:13,369  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
He's lowered the weapon.
Don't shoot her.

1534
01:49:13,442 --> 01:49:14,534  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
You take that shot, Jordy.

1535
01:49:14,610 --> 01:49:16,578  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
He lowered his weapon.
Don't shoot her.

1536
01:49:16,646 --> 01:49:18,273  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
No! Jordy! No.

1537
01:49:18,347 --> 01:49:20,315  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
He lowered the weapon,
all right?

1538
01:49:38,034 --> 01:49:40,332  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
You're OK. Don't look back.

1539
01:49:40,403 --> 01:49:42,735  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Don't look at him.

1540
01:49:48,578 --> 01:49:51,945  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Fuck! Did you get that? Fuck!

1541
01:49:57,053 --> 01:49:58,748  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Come on,
let's get you out of here.

1542
01:49:58,821 --> 01:50:00,345  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Come on, let's go.

1543
01:50:05,228 --> 01:50:06,991  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Boss, he's still alive.

1544
01:50:07,063 --> 01:50:08,291  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Come on. Let's go.

1545
01:50:33,055 --> 01:50:36,889  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
A film by Oleg Razgul.

1546
01:50:51,107 --> 01:50:53,598  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
How was that?

1547
01:50:55,011 --> 01:50:56,273  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
That was great.

1548
01:51:17,366 --> 01:51:18,799  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Thanks.

1549
01:51:25,808 --> 01:51:27,241  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
I thought you might want that.

1550
01:51:34,016 --> 01:51:35,847  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Alan, here. Take this camera.

1551
01:51:38,120 --> 01:51:40,452  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Marshal, you feel up
to making a statement?

1552
01:51:40,523 --> 01:51:43,458  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Forget it. No statement.
Cut the camera.

1553
01:51:43,526 --> 01:51:46,723  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Listen, I can help you.
Take a lesson from Eddie.

1554
01:51:46,796 --> 01:51:48,127  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
The media
can be a powerful ally.

1555
01:51:53,035 --> 01:51:56,334  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Eddie was my friend.
I'd like to be yours, too.

1556
01:52:19,195 --> 01:52:20,492  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
Good job.

1557
01:53:09,645 --> 01:53:11,943  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
-You OK?
-I'm fine. Fuck him.

1558
01:53:12,014 --> 01:53:14,141  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Follow him walking away,
then whip back to me.

1559
01:53:24,794 --> 01:53:27,456  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
We've been talking with
Fire Marshal Jordan Warsaw.

1560
01:53:27,530 --> 01:53:30,624  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
He's understandably overwhelmed
with what's just occurred--

1561
01:53:30,699 --> 01:53:32,963  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
the tragic end
of two vicious psychopaths...

1562
01:53:33,035 --> 01:53:34,798  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
who attempted to manipulate
the news media...

1563
01:53:34,870 --> 01:53:36,770  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:398 Y2:431
for their own greed and egos.

1564
01:53:36,839 --> 01:53:40,832  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
We at "Top Story" will never
be used in this way.

1565
01:53:40,910 --> 01:53:44,505  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
Our goal is to bring you
the news in all its complexity.

1566
01:53:44,580 --> 01:53:46,810  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
The truth was
the real hero here today...

1567
01:53:46,882 --> 01:53:51,080  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
and we're proud to bring it
to you on "Top Story."

1568
01:53:51,153 --> 01:53:54,520  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:364 Y2:431
This is Robert Hawkins.
Good night.
