00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:38,660
- Ease up. What's the matter with you?
- Just call it professional curiosity.

157
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:41,259
I just need to know
about these people.

158
00:17:41,391 --> 00:17:43,540
And if there's something you think...

159
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:47,380
What does it matter what I think?
I'm just a driver.

160
00:17:47,511 --> 00:17:50,547
But if you have your suspicions,
shouldn't you tell someone?

161
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,786
Who? The police?!

162
00:18:27,228 --> 00:18:28,980
Cedric?

163
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,860
You back, babe?

164
00:19:21,025 --> 00:19:23,379
Put down the knife.

165
00:19:23,504 --> 00:19:25,496
We just wanna talk to ya.

166
00:19:27,585 --> 00:19:30,462
Tell your husband to back away
from the Manning case.

167
00:19:30,584 --> 00:19:32,894
Tell him yourself, you coward!

168
00:19:33,025 --> 00:19:34,855
No! No!

169
00:19:34,984 --> 00:19:37,373
Get off me! Get off me!

170
00:19:37,504 --> 00:19:39,734
- No! Get off me!
- Give me the fucking knife!

171
00:19:39,864 --> 00:19:41,775
Get off me!

172
00:20:01,903 --> 00:20:05,896
I must point out the room has never
been used as an office by Manning.

173
00:20:06,023 --> 00:20:09,059
But instead as a storage space

174
00:20:09,182 --> 00:20:13,698
to house our client's extensive collection
of vintage model racing cars

175
00:20:13,822 --> 00:20:16,655
numbering in excess to 1,400.

176
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,815
You getting in?

177
00:21:01,419 --> 00:21:03,774
I've seen inside your room, sir.

178
00:21:06,699 --> 00:21:08,815
Yeah? What did you see?

179
00:21:11,179 --> 00:21:13,568
Would you like a cup of tea?

180
00:21:15,938 --> 00:21:18,772
AK-47 s, Remingtons, Glocks, Sigs.

181
00:21:18,899 --> 00:21:22,254
I'm guessing you were in the army.
You can't get that on the street

182
00:21:22,378 --> 00:21:24,608
unless you're friendly with the Taliban.

183
00:21:26,537 --> 00:21:30,087
I wanted to be in the army. They
wouldn't let me. Got a criminal record.

184
00:21:30,218 --> 00:21:34,529
In the TA for a while.
Got kicked out of there.

185
00:21:34,657 --> 00:21:37,251
Got a bit heavy with one of the NCOs.

186
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:41,011
Fucking Black thought he was Rambo.

187
00:21:41,137 --> 00:21:43,731
Came unstuck with me, though.

188
00:21:43,857 --> 00:21:49,374
Here, talking about Blacks, guess what's
happened to an old barrister of mine.

189
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:52,051
No?

190
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:56,135
Someone's only gone and stabbed his
pregnant missus in the stomach.

191
00:21:56,256 --> 00:21:58,894
Killed their baby. How sick's that?

192
00:21:59,976 --> 00:22:03,605
People like us...
We wouldn't stand for it, would we?

193
00:22:04,935 --> 00:22:07,529
I'd kill them with my bare hands.

194
00:22:10,615 --> 00:22:12,367
What did you do?

195
00:22:12,495 --> 00:22:16,966
Didn't do nothing. He was my barrister
years ago. Something about football.

196
00:22:17,095 --> 00:22:19,655
- I just heard about it.
- No, I mean, what do you do?

197
00:22:19,775 --> 00:22:22,129
Here?

198
00:22:22,254 --> 00:22:26,089
Head of security. Good job. I like it.

199
00:22:26,215 --> 00:22:30,173
Here, look, I wanna show you
something. You're a soldier.

200
00:22:30,294 --> 00:22:32,250
You'll like this.

201
00:22:36,014 --> 00:22:39,449
Rigged it all up myself.
No one else knows about it.

202
00:22:50,693 --> 00:22:52,729
Both got a secret, you and me.

203
00:23:04,092 --> 00:23:06,322
It's a dirty fucking world.

204
00:23:08,252 --> 00:23:12,369
I've seen things happen in these rooms
you wouldn't have seen as a soldier.

205
00:23:16,332 --> 00:23:18,925
Trust me.

206
00:23:19,051 --> 00:23:22,044
You could stay here if you wanted.

207
00:23:24,691 --> 00:23:26,522
I'm married.

208
00:23:26,651 --> 00:23:30,280
I'm not a queer if that's what you think.
I just meant you could stay here.

209
00:23:30,411 --> 00:23:34,403
Use the camp bed
whilst you sort yourself out.

210
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:36,361
It's up to you.

211
00:23:38,571 --> 00:23:41,289
What's the matter, mate?
You look really upset.

212
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:43,480
I pissed you off?

213
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:46,727
- No.
- Is it me? Have I pissed you off?

214
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:50,398
It's all right. I'll be fine. I just need
to get my head down, all right?

215
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:52,679
Maybe I'll see you soon, eh?

216
00:23:52,809 --> 00:23:55,448
I could call your missus for you,
if you want.

217
00:23:55,569 --> 00:23:57,799
Let her know where you are.

218
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:11,959
- 'Hello, Mardell speaking. '
- Sir. It's Bryant.

219
00:24:12,089 --> 00:24:14,556
'Bryant. How are you? '

220
00:24:14,688 --> 00:24:16,679
I need to see you, sir.

221
00:24:16,808 --> 00:24:19,561
'OK, well, come over in the morning. '

222
00:24:19,688 --> 00:24:21,519
Yes, sir.

223
00:24:40,526 --> 00:24:42,916
Goodnight, soldier.

224
00:24:50,366 --> 00:24:52,436
It's beautiful, sir.

225
00:24:53,566 --> 00:24:55,955
Beats Kandahar.

226
00:24:58,606 --> 00:25:01,279
Now, what's on your mind, Bryant?

227
00:25:03,925 --> 00:25:06,280
Is everything OK at home?

228
00:25:08,125 --> 00:25:10,002
Yeah.

229
00:25:10,125 --> 00:25:12,002
Then why did you come here?

230
00:25:14,484 --> 00:25:18,364
It's just... I don't know.
I don't see the point, sir.

231
00:25:19,524 --> 00:25:23,404
You know? Being over there
and then coming home.

232
00:25:24,604 --> 00:25:26,481
It's almost worse here.

233
00:25:26,604 --> 00:25:29,676
You're a soldier. It's your job.
What do you want, sympathy?

234
00:25:29,804 --> 00:25:32,841
No, but I wanna do something,
you know?

235
00:25:34,484 --> 00:25:37,998
I don't wanna be
just another face in the crowd,

236
00:25:38,123 --> 00:25:41,115
otherwise what was I doing out there?

237
00:25:41,243 --> 00:25:45,600
I wanna... I wanna be remembered.

238
00:25:49,043 --> 00:25:50,795
That'll be Sandy.

239
00:25:50,923 --> 00:25:52,674
How is he, sir?

240
00:25:52,802 --> 00:25:55,555
He never even
made it back to Cambridge.

241
00:25:55,683 --> 00:25:57,912
Talk to him, Bryant.

242
00:25:58,042 --> 00:26:00,351
He liked you.

243
00:26:06,162 --> 00:26:09,995
What would you do to them
if you could find them, Sandy?

244
00:26:10,121 --> 00:26:12,590
They go around wrecking lives.

245
00:26:12,722 --> 00:26:17,033
And when they get caught, they get
a slap on the wrist. If it were me, I'd...

246
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,757
Help me.

247
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,873
Thanks, Sarge.

248
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:42,073
There was a man, Walter.

249
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,788
He followed me into the toilet and he
threatened me. Told me to walk away.

250
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,195
I can't prove it.

251
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:55,549
So it will never come to light.

252
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:00,433
And Manning was in the same room as
me when this happened to Marcia.

253
00:27:00,558 --> 00:27:04,234
So how are we going to pin it on them?

254
00:27:04,358 --> 00:27:06,349
We can't.

255
00:27:06,478 --> 00:27:08,947
I mean, I should know. It's my job.

256
00:27:11,718 --> 00:27:13,913
It was my wife.

257
00:27:14,838 --> 00:27:17,511
They tried to kill my wife.

258
00:27:19,358 --> 00:27:21,427
And they killed my baby.

259
00:27:26,917 --> 00:27:28,828
Oh, God...

260
00:27:30,077 --> 00:27:33,626
She's gonna pull through, Cedric.
She's gonna be all right.

261
00:27:34,317 --> 00:27:35,796
Yeah.

262
00:28:01,475 --> 00:28:03,227
Can I help you?

263
00:28:03,355 --> 00:28:06,472
My name's Hillier.
You represented me a while back.

264
00:28:08,915 --> 00:28:12,065
- How did you know where I live?
- I work in security, remember?

265
00:28:12,194 --> 00:28:14,425
These are for your loss.

266
00:28:17,194 --> 00:28:20,948
Thank you very much, Hillier.
That is... very kind of you.

267
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:25,147
Listen carefully. I know a man who can
help you with what's just happened.

268
00:28:25,274 --> 00:28:29,027
You call us on this number if you want
to do something. It's up to you.

269
00:28:36,233 --> 00:28:39,589
City boy.
Yeah, it is a long time no speak.

270
00:28:41,273 --> 00:28:42,501
Really?

271
00:28:42,633 --> 00:28:46,147
Come to the hotel tomorrow at 5:00.
Don't knock on the door.

272
00:28:46,272 --> 00:28:48,229
OK.

273
00:28:53,152 --> 00:28:56,428
That was the geezer
I went to school with. Complete nutter.

274
00:28:56,552 --> 00:28:59,783
- He knows people.
- You're gonna get them done?

275
00:29:01,391 --> 00:29:02,905
I'm gonna do something.

276
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:07,024
Oi, Dekker.
Have you thought about our little deal?

277
00:29:07,151 --> 00:29:09,745
Dan, please. Look at the state of me.

278
00:29:09,871 --> 00:29:12,943
You've got a week.
Otherwise you'll get ironed out again.

279
00:29:13,071 --> 00:29:14,390
Right.

280
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:23,146
He'd be on the list as well.
You watch, Frank.

281
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:25,101
He'll get served.

282
00:29:52,109 --> 00:29:54,384
They didn't fuck about with you,
did they?

283
00:29:57,028 --> 00:29:59,258
That's why I'm here, Simon.

284
00:30:04,348 --> 00:30:06,464
What do you need?

285
00:30:07,587 --> 00:30:09,738
I dunno.

286
00:30:31,626 --> 00:30:32,821
Yeah.

287
00:30:35,107 --> 00:30:37,700
You know me, Gene.
I'll get whatever you want.

288
00:30:46,785 --> 00:30:48,184
How much?

289
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:51,104
What are you doing?
Put it away. Don't work like that.

290
00:30:51,226 --> 00:30:53,455
Put it away.

291
00:30:55,065 --> 00:30:57,738
If you're gonna do anything,
don't do it on your own.

292
00:30:59,665 --> 00:31:01,974
I know people.

293
00:31:02,505 --> 00:31:03,823
Mate of mine.

294
00:31:04,824 --> 00:31:06,577
Fucking hurt there.

295
00:31:08,345 --> 00:31:10,016
Can I meet him?

296
00:31:10,144 --> 00:31:11,816
Yeah.

297
00:31:11,944 --> 00:31:16,779
But if I set it up,
I don't want you fucking about.

298
00:31:16,904 --> 00:31:20,498
Hmm? Me and my mate,
we go to work properly, understand?

299
00:31:22,984 --> 00:31:24,576
So what now?

300
00:31:36,542 --> 00:31:39,341
- 'Hello? '
- How can you help me?

301
00:31:39,463 --> 00:31:42,898
- 'Come to the hotel I work at, 3:00am. '
- Where is that?

302
00:31:43,022 --> 00:31:45,901
- 'Look in your files. Under Hillier. '
- I'll be there.

303
00:31:46,023 --> 00:31:50,174
Good. And don't knock on the door.

304
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:19,219
- 'How can you help me? '
- 'Come to the hotel I work at, 3:00am. '

305
00:32:19,341 --> 00:32:20,456
'Where is that? '

306
00:33:09,258 --> 00:33:11,452
What am I doing here?

307
00:33:14,097 --> 00:33:16,328
I'm a barrister, for Chrissakes.

308
00:33:16,457 --> 00:33:18,607
You've got nowhere else to go.

309
00:33:25,297 --> 00:33:27,128
I am really sorry.

310
00:33:27,257 --> 00:33:29,850
I have to go. I can't do this.

311
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:34,725
- I am supposed to uphold the law.
- But the law's failed you.

312
00:33:43,016 --> 00:33:45,404
Thank you for seeing me, Mr Bryant.

313
00:33:50,295 --> 00:33:52,934
You know where I am now.

314
00:34:14,614 --> 00:34:18,606
- When did you get down here?
- Day before yesterday.

315
00:34:18,733 --> 00:34:20,611
Took Dad's car.

316
00:34:22,174 --> 00:34:25,051
It's good you came.
You should be proud of yourself.

317
00:34:25,173 --> 00:34:28,529
Proud I can drive? Look at me.

318
00:34:34,932 --> 00:34:37,163
Think I'm having
a get-together this week.

319
00:34:37,293 --> 00:34:40,125
Just a few like-minded people,
you know?

320
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:44,124
Should er... Should come along.

321
00:34:44,252 --> 00:34:46,322
To do what?

322
00:34:46,452 --> 00:34:50,365
Nothing special. Maybe a bit of keep fit.

323
00:34:50,492 --> 00:34:52,482
Good for you.

324
00:34:53,292 --> 00:34:55,522
Even if you just say hello.

325
00:35:01,051 --> 00:35:04,009
- I'm gonna go.
- No, stay, it's OK.

326
00:35:04,931 --> 00:35:07,126
I don't wanna be like this all my life.

327
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:25,883
I'm so sorry, Mr Monroe.

328
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:28,399
There's nothing more we could do.

329
00:36:16,487 --> 00:36:18,045
Come in.

330
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:32,558
What are you doing here?

331
00:36:32,686 --> 00:36:34,404
Eh?

332
00:36:46,765 --> 00:36:50,678
I said what the fuck are you doing here?
Why have you come here?

333
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:55,080
To learn how to fight.

334
00:36:55,205 --> 00:36:57,196
Says who?

335
00:37:01,244 --> 00:37:04,953
- Hillier said you'd teach us how to fight.
- I can't teach you how to fight.

336
00:37:06,604 --> 00:37:08,993
Because you already can.

337
00:37:10,763 --> 00:37:12,516
It's already in you.

338
00:37:18,763 --> 00:37:22,472
- Where are you going, Monroe?
- I can't do this.

339
00:37:22,603 --> 00:37:24,594
I...

340
00:37:28,403 --> 00:37:30,439
Sorry to hear about your wife.

341
00:37:35,963 --> 00:37:38,556
For fuck's sake, Monroe.

342
00:37:39,442 --> 00:37:42,115
Think you wandered in here by mistake?

343
00:37:44,442 --> 00:37:46,637
Deep down, you wanna stay,

344
00:37:46,762 --> 00:37:49,514
because you've been abandoned
by the powers that be.

345
00:37:49,641 --> 00:37:54,715
There's nowhere else to turn. Get
your shoes off and fall back in line.

346
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,277
Get AIDS,

347
00:38:02,401 --> 00:38:05,392
or jump on a bus
with a rucksack full of explosives,

348
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,988
the government will dish you out
a free car,

349
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,918
but keep your head down,
be good and walk without a limp,

350
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,031
and you get zip.

351
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,672
That's why you're all here.

352
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,194
You count for nothing.

353
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,356
And your cries fall on deaf ears.
Same as me.

354
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:30,675
The only difference between us is
I've got the confidence to fight back.

355
00:38:33,279 --> 00:38:35,668
So how do we fight back?

356
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:39,592
I don't know yet.

357
00:38:40,798 --> 00:38:45,633
But if you want to spend your life getting
bullied and raped by cunts like Blair,

358
00:38:45,758 --> 00:38:49,388
and having paedophiles
wander the fucking playgrounds

359
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:53,431
while you smile mutely
and pay your fucking taxes...

360
00:38:55,837 --> 00:38:58,113
...then get out the door.

361
00:39:03,477 --> 00:39:05,433
I wanna learn how to fight back.

362
00:39:05,558 --> 00:39:07,354
So do I.

363
00:39:10,317 --> 00:39:12,034
Me too.

364
00:39:21,797 --> 00:39:23,024
Good.

365
00:39:38,596 --> 00:39:42,907
No, you're wrong. You use
the inside of your hand, not your fist.

366
00:39:43,035 --> 00:39:48,109
Smack 'em on the nose, sends the
nose bone straight up into the brain.

367
00:39:48,235 --> 00:39:51,192
That will kill 'em instantly.
Reckon you could do it?

368
00:39:51,314 --> 00:39:54,147
I'd rather let Bryant do it for me.

369
00:39:54,274 --> 00:39:57,550
And that will save you
getting a 23 rec in prison.

370
00:39:57,674 --> 00:40:03,067
How do you prefer to kill people, yeah?
Up close and personal, bare hands,

371
00:40:03,194 --> 00:40:06,743
or sniper rifle, 300 yards, bingo?

372
00:40:06,874 --> 00:40:09,228
I'd rather get you to do it for me.

373
00:40:10,513 --> 00:40:12,664
I'd be happy to.

374
00:40:13,993 --> 00:40:17,383
I'm going to the toilet.
Try not to kill anybody while I'm away.

375
00:40:19,633 --> 00:40:22,909
What did I tell you, eh?
Fucking out-there.

376
00:40:23,033 --> 00:40:27,424
- He's completely insane.
- Maybe. But he speaks sense.

377
00:40:29,033 --> 00:40:31,307
Same again for everyone?

378
00:40:35,512 --> 00:40:37,503
He's a fucking mug, huh?

379
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:41,510
If someone killed my family and I found
'em, I'd send 'em a fucking nail bomb.

380
00:40:41,631 --> 00:40:44,305
No, it's a letter bomb.
That's what you'd send.

381
00:40:48,591 --> 00:40:50,547
Excuse me.

382
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:54,068
Why don't you look where you're going,
you black cunt?

383
00:40:54,191 --> 00:40:59,184
Do yourself a favour and fuck off before
you get opened up like a tin of beans.

384
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:02,781
- What kind of fucking nutter are you?
- Fuck off.

385
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:05,860
- What happened?
- Nothing. Can we leave?

386
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:09,300
- What happened?
- I spilt the drinks. I'd like to leave.

387
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:12,024
- Who started on you?
- It was just some lads.

388
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:15,141
They called me a black 'C' and...
Could we just leave?

389
00:41:15,269 --> 00:41:17,386
- Who was it?
- Doesn't matter.

390
00:41:20,549 --> 00:41:22,267
Who is it? Eh?

391
00:41:22,389 --> 00:41:25,267
It's the one with the dark hair
and blue T-shirt.

392
00:41:31,588 --> 00:41:35,138
- You call my mate a black cunt?
- Who are you, you fucking mug?

393
00:41:35,269 --> 00:41:37,498
- Wanna make one?
- I'll fucking make one!

394
00:41:37,628 --> 00:41:40,666
- I'll fucking make one.
- Outside, all of you. Five minutes.

395
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:43,302
We'll fucking be there.
He's gonna go, this cunt.

396
00:41:47,427 --> 00:41:49,384
We're gonna fight 'em.

397
00:41:49,508 --> 00:41:52,818
- Excuse me?
- Come on, this is it.

398
00:41:52,947 --> 00:41:55,017
For fuck's sake, Bryant. No way.

399
00:41:55,147 --> 00:41:58,537
Come on, stand with me.
We can do this. Don't fall away.

400
00:42:01,027 --> 00:42:02,904
This is it. We can do it!

401
00:42:09,866 --> 00:42:11,743
I'm with you, boss.

402
00:42:15,346 --> 00:42:18,224
Right, come on.

403
00:42:18,346 --> 00:42:20,462
Come on.

404
00:42:27,945 --> 00:42:30,779
Now we're talking bollocks.
Watch these smudges up here.

405
00:42:30,906 --> 00:42:32,861
Come here.

406
00:42:32,985 --> 00:42:37,342
- I'm going right through him.
- Come and stand over here.

407
00:42:37,465 --> 00:42:40,298
Eh? Fucking stand with me.
Fucking stand with me.

408
00:42:40,425 --> 00:42:43,097
You come here cos of them smudges.

409
00:42:43,224 --> 00:42:45,021
Don't you fucking wanna...

410
00:43:05,823 --> 00:43:07,495
Let's go. We're gonna get nicked.

411
00:43:07,623 --> 00:43:11,536
Fucking saucy cunts.
Come on. Let's go.

412
00:44:57,737 --> 00:44:59,295
What?

413
00:44:59,417 --> 00:45:01,294
You fucking know what.

414
00:45:01,417 --> 00:45:04,648
- I was shitting myself.
- So was I.

415
00:45:04,777 --> 00:45:07,211
But at least I stood.

416
00:45:10,776 --> 00:45:15,566
And Lord hold Marcia
underneath your wing.

417
00:45:17,096 --> 00:45:19,928
Guide her with your loving hands

418
00:45:20,055 --> 00:45:23,412
through the passages of heaven.

419
00:45:24,735 --> 00:45:26,407
Amen.

420
00:45:46,254 --> 00:45:48,051
Come here.

421
00:45:53,014 --> 00:45:54,925
Are you religious?

422
00:45:55,054 --> 00:45:58,170
I stopped believing
when I realised no one was listening.

423
00:45:59,573 --> 00:46:01,166
Your lip's swollen.

424
00:46:01,294 --> 00:46:03,124
I fell.

425
00:46:07,453 --> 00:46:11,241
I've been listening to everything that's
happened over the past few days.

426
00:46:11,373 --> 00:46:14,603
- That's illegal.
- So's what you've been doing.

427
00:46:15,332 --> 00:46:18,291
- Where's Danny Bryant?
- How the hell should I know?

428
00:46:18,413 --> 00:46:21,484
Well, find him and tell him
I wanna meet with him.

429
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:25,081
Otherwise I'll have you all nicked
for assault.

430
00:46:27,412 --> 00:46:29,642
I thought you were different.

431
00:46:56,810 --> 00:46:58,687
Do you mind if we talk alone?

432
00:47:15,849 --> 00:47:17,601
Para?

433
00:47:17,729 --> 00:47:20,640
I was Engineers. Where did you serve?

434
00:47:20,768 --> 00:47:24,478
Falklands, Afghanistan, Iraq.
What the fuck does it matter?

435
00:47:24,609 --> 00:47:27,361
If you wanna arrest me, get on with it.

436
00:47:28,968 --> 00:47:30,607
Do you mind?

437
00:47:58,527 --> 00:48:01,518
You know, two weeks ago,

438
00:48:01,646 --> 00:48:03,638
some kids from our street...

439
00:48:05,486 --> 00:48:09,843
They set fire to a 79-year-old woman

440
00:48:09,966 --> 00:48:12,605
because she called the police.

441
00:48:12,726 --> 00:48:16,320
After they tried to rob her, three times.

442
00:48:17,525 --> 00:48:20,165
And do you know what the police said?

443
00:48:23,125 --> 00:48:24,877
Paperwork.

444
00:48:32,804 --> 00:48:34,715
I'm here to help you.

445
00:48:37,125 --> 00:48:39,558
I heard what you said in the sports hall.

446
00:48:39,684 --> 00:48:41,515
I wanna help ya.

447
00:48:42,404 --> 00:48:47,353
I can get you sleeves on all Manning's
people, the ones that hurt Monroe.

448
00:48:47,484 --> 00:48:50,316
The ones that killed his family.

449
00:48:50,443 --> 00:48:52,753
The law failed him.

450
00:48:52,884 --> 00:48:54,397
We won't.

451
00:48:56,043 --> 00:49:02,482
You get that right and I'll
feed you paedophiles, dealers,

452
00:49:02,603 --> 00:49:09,156
bullies, junkies, scum,
cunts, dogs... the lot.

453
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:13,874
And on top of that,

454
00:49:14,002 --> 00:49:18,280
I'll try and keep you
one step ahead of the law.

455
00:49:19,602 --> 00:49:21,274
Yeah?

456
00:49:21,402 --> 00:49:28,876
This is my job. This is what they gave
me after serving 25 years on the force.

457
00:49:29,001 --> 00:49:35,110
I get to drive high-risk
prosecution and collect CCTVs.

458
00:49:36,641 --> 00:49:38,757
You wanna know why?

459
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:42,718
Because I play it by the fucking book.

460
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:50,748
You wanna hurt people like Manning,
get the people around him.

461
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:56,077
What about the people
that attacked Mardell?

462
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,199
You're on.

463
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,513
'Fuck you! You fucking fuck! '

464
00:50:20,038 --> 00:50:22,030
We're one short tonight, gents.

465
00:50:22,159 --> 00:50:26,276
Not everybody's got the appetite for it.
Glad to see you do.

466
00:50:27,478 --> 00:50:28,957
Now.

467
00:50:30,038 --> 00:50:33,587
I'm gonna walk out that door in a minute.
There is no training tonight.

468
00:50:33,718 --> 00:50:39,156
The next time you see me, it'll only be if
you're serious about doing this properly.

469
00:50:39,278 --> 00:50:43,429
About putting something of substance
together. Legitimate targets.

470
00:50:43,557 --> 00:50:47,948
I'm talking about people that hurt you.
I'm talking about fucking violence.

471
00:50:55,997 --> 00:50:58,749
So go home and make a decision.

472
00:50:59,716 --> 00:51:02,515
You're either with me or you're not.

473
00:51:03,196 --> 00:51:06,472
If you are,
I'll be at the hotel at midday tomorrow.

474
00:51:06,596 --> 00:51:10,987
If you're not, forget you ever met me.

475
00:52:24,672 --> 00:52:26,548
That's them.

476
00:52:26,671 --> 00:52:31,142
Two IC1 s heading towards you.
Intercept and wait for me.

477
00:52:36,431 --> 00:52:38,068
How are you, man?

478
00:52:38,348 --> 00:52:39,987


479
00:53:08,347 --> 00:53:09,905
Go on.

480
00:53:17,026 --> 00:53:18,664
Go on.

481
00:53:57,304 --> 00:53:58,373
Enough, Bryant.

482
00:53:59,824 --> 00:54:01,382
Enough!

483
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:29,096
- Apple bag, please.
- Give me the money and then pick it up.

484
00:54:36,862 --> 00:54:39,500
You work for Terry Manning, don't you?

485
00:54:39,621 --> 00:54:41,213
So what if I fucking do?

486
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:46,210
- I have a message for him.
- What's that, then?

487
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:10,936
OK, go! Go! Come on, go!

488
00:55:20,259 --> 00:55:22,489
Do you live round here?

489
00:55:24,059 --> 00:55:27,256
Two drug dealers left for dead.

490
00:55:27,979 --> 00:55:31,892
This is gang related. We've yet
to study the CCTV footage but...

491
00:55:33,899 --> 00:55:35,934
Move along, just move along.

492
00:55:39,659 --> 00:55:43,367
The investigation's ongoing
so I'd rather not comment further.

493
00:56:02,856 --> 00:56:07,931
Sir, the caretaker called me up.
The monitors are on the blink.

494
00:56:08,057 --> 00:56:10,616
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

495
00:56:11,577 --> 00:56:13,693
And you'd know about that, would you?

496
00:56:13,816 --> 00:56:18,367
You'll find that I did serve five years
in the Royal Engineers.

497
00:56:18,496 --> 00:56:20,373
Indeed you did.

498
00:56:20,496 --> 00:56:22,851
Shall I have another go, sir?

499
00:56:22,976 --> 00:56:25,125
You do what you want, Lewis.

500
00:56:25,255 --> 00:56:27,485
As long as you find out
who did this, huh?

501
00:56:42,734 --> 00:56:45,090
Before you smile, watch this.

502
00:56:53,774 --> 00:56:56,607
Camera 2 picked you all up
making your getaway.

503
00:57:07,453 --> 00:57:10,570
Be careful. I may not be there next time.

504
00:57:11,613 --> 00:57:14,525
Four cameras were watching.
We got two of 'em.

505
00:57:14,653 --> 00:57:18,566
Fortunately, only one of them
matters this time. Now...

506
00:57:21,532 --> 00:57:24,649
These are two more faces
on the Manning payroll.

507
00:57:24,772 --> 00:57:29,448
Tomorrow, they transport laundered
drug money to a safe house.

508
00:57:29,572 --> 00:57:34,009
Cos they had the police in their pocket,
there's no reason for 'em to suspect.

509
00:57:34,132 --> 00:57:38,090
But be careful. Faces like this
don't go down like junkies.

510
00:57:39,651 --> 00:57:42,768
- Isn't it robbery?
- Hit 'em quick and hard. They'll fold.

511
00:57:42,891 --> 00:57:46,440
- What about police traffic?
- I can only do so much.

512
00:57:47,651 --> 00:57:50,927
Give me your fucking keys, now.
Get down on the floor!

513
00:57:51,051 --> 00:57:53,883
Down on the floor. You stay there.

514
00:57:54,010 --> 00:57:56,729
You stay there. Come on!

515
00:57:58,571 --> 00:58:00,845
Get down. Don't you move!

516
00:58:03,810 --> 00:58:05,721
Get on the fucking corner!

517
00:58:05,850 --> 00:58:07,681
- Stay there!
- Get down, you cunt!

518
00:58:12,889 --> 00:58:14,289
Come on!

519
00:58:16,249 --> 00:58:18,319
Keep down! Don't move!

520
00:58:26,569 --> 00:58:28,559
Go, go! Get in! Fucking idiot!

521
00:58:30,049 --> 00:58:31,960
Get in, you fucking idiot!

522
00:58:40,608 --> 00:58:42,678
Fucking idiot! What did you do?

523
00:58:42,808 --> 00:58:45,241
Me? That black bastard
pushed me out the way.

524
00:58:45,367 --> 00:58:47,723
- Who you calling a black 'B'?
- You, you mug.

525
00:58:47,848 --> 00:58:50,520
You pushed me out of the way.
You fucking mug!

526
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:54,847
Leave it! Leave it!

527
00:58:54,967 --> 00:58:57,845
- We got something, didn't we?
- Not the point.

528
00:58:57,967 --> 00:59:00,560
You're fucking useless, all of you.

529
00:59:00,686 --> 00:59:03,155
Couldn't take money
when it's sitting on a plate.

530
00:59:03,287 --> 00:59:05,721
I didn't know the police
were gonna be driving by.

531
00:59:05,847 --> 00:59:08,360
Shut up. You're as bad as him.
Like fucking kids.

532
00:59:11,726 --> 00:59:14,559
Extraordinary events
in a London suburb this morning.

533
00:59:14,686 --> 00:59:16,483
What appeared to be a robbery

534
00:59:16,606 --> 00:59:20,281
ended in thieves emptying sacks of cash
over the streets for the public.

535
00:59:20,406 --> 00:59:22,397
'Extraordinary scenes indeed.

536
00:59:22,526 --> 00:59:27,156
'Lt seems that the gang took the money
from known drug dealers

537
00:59:27,286 --> 00:59:32,279
'slit open the bag and then let it go
from the back of their getaway van.

538
00:59:34,044 --> 00:59:37,355
'Eyewitnesses reported that
the masked raiders waved at police

539
00:59:37,485 --> 00:59:40,635
'as the money was distributed
into the streets. '

540
00:59:43,845 --> 00:59:45,755
We're famous.

541
00:59:51,243 --> 00:59:56,363
Someone's taking the piss, someone
under our roof. I've got too much to lose.

542
00:59:56,483 --> 00:59:59,520
- Yes, sir. Clearly.
- Talk to the ghosts, see what they have.

543
00:59:59,644 --> 01:00:01,599
Who are these fucking people?

544
01:00:08,043 --> 01:00:11,035
Good afternoon.
We believe we have evidence

545
01:00:11,163 --> 01:00:15,872
linking the robbery to the attempted
murders of the drug dealers this week.

546
01:00:16,003 --> 01:00:19,881
We believe the same gang
is responsible for both crimes.

547
01:00:20,002 --> 01:00:22,800
And we are treating this
as a priority case.

548
01:00:24,282 --> 01:00:30,436
We also believe the gang have made
connections within the police force.

549
01:00:30,561 --> 01:00:33,793
We will leave no stone unturned

550
01:00:33,922 --> 01:00:37,709
in our attempts to bring police corruption
to justice.

551
01:00:39,681 --> 01:00:42,991
'These gang members are nothing more
than mindless outlaws.

552
01:00:43,121 --> 01:00:45,794
'And while certain members of the media

553
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:50,870

the public to lionise these street gangs,

554
01:00:51,001 --> 01:00:55,915
'this footage shows the true horror
of what we are dealing with.

555
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:58,031
'The gang are armed.

556
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:02,550
'And the public should not approach them
under any circumstances.

557

is our priority. '

559
01:01:10,999 --> 01:01:15,470

by both the government and the police.

561

563

'Police criticised the media
for "hero worshipping" the armed gang

a "Robin Hood-style" organisation. '

'... who they are
and why they've taken to the streets.

as heroes or villains. '

568
01:01:48,357 --> 01:01:52,430
Bullies. I put them top of my list,
you know?

569
01:01:52,556 --> 01:01:54,946
I hate 'em.

570
01:01:55,077 --> 01:01:57,830
There's a few that are gonna get served
one day.

571
01:01:57,957 --> 01:02:00,151
Why stop there?
We can do what we want.

572
01:02:00,276 --> 01:02:02,837
- Know where to draw the line.
- What line?

573
01:02:02,957 --> 01:02:06,471
What are you gonna do? Punch every
traffic warden you come across?

574
01:02:06,596 --> 01:02:11,511
No. I'm talking about your nonces and
that. Your Gary Glitters, your grasses.

575
01:02:11,636 --> 01:02:15,628
Sickos, Muslims.
Hang the fucking lot of them.

576
01:02:15,755 --> 01:02:19,795
Lan Huntley.
He'll be the first to fucking go.

577
01:02:19,916 --> 01:02:24,147
I'm a Muslim, Hillier.
Do you want to kill me?

578
01:02:24,275 --> 01:02:25,946
You ain't a Muslim. You're black.

579
01:02:26,074 --> 01:02:29,545
So I'm not allowed to be a Muslim
because I'm black?

580
01:02:29,675 --> 01:02:33,223
Here, boss. What was that thing
you said about suicide bombers?

581
01:02:33,354 --> 01:02:37,188
You don't have to be a Muslim to blow
yourself up. I'm talking individuals.

582
01:02:37,314 --> 01:02:41,193
- You gonna kill the Irish cos of the IRA?
- Yeah, I would.

583
01:02:41,314 --> 01:02:43,782
You're such a Philistine
sometimes, Hillier.

584
01:02:43,914 --> 01:02:46,189
No, I'm British 100%, me.

585
01:02:52,274 --> 01:02:56,107
Listen. I'm here
because my wife and child are dead.

586
01:02:56,233 --> 01:03:00,784
That has nothing to do with race
or religion.

587
01:03:00,913 --> 01:03:02,346
OK?

588
01:03:07,953 --> 01:03:12,946
Get to a landline and call me back
on 02074960209.

589
01:03:19,472 --> 01:03:21,621
- What's wrong?
- I think Greaves is on me.

590
01:03:21,751 --> 01:03:26,542
Don't worry. This is swept.
Listen. I've found the CCTV

591
01:03:26,672 --> 01:03:28,548
from the court toilets with Monroe.

592
01:03:28,671 --> 01:03:32,789
'Your man's called Furlong. Lan Furlong.

'He currently resides in a bail hostel
in the West Country. '

594
01:03:37,591 --> 01:03:41,027
Text me his address to Dekker's phone.
Why's he on bail?

595
01:03:41,151 --> 01:03:43,381
Shoplifting crayons, apparently.

596
01:03:43,511 --> 01:03:48,744
CPS document said he was originally
charged with sexually assaulting a minor.

597
01:03:48,871 --> 01:03:53,307
But they buried it, down to his
cooperation with certain police officers.

598
01:03:53,430 --> 01:03:56,228
The geezer's a fucking nonce.
Put him down.

599
01:03:56,350 --> 01:03:59,626
You're a good man, Walter.
Thanks for everything.

600
01:03:59,750 --> 01:04:01,740
Yeah. You too, son.

601
01:04:17,748 --> 01:04:19,579
So where are you from?

602
01:04:20,549 --> 01:04:22,380
You married?

603
01:04:26,268 --> 01:04:28,543
I'm supposed to be getting married soon.

604
01:04:28,668 --> 01:04:31,978
- Yeah?
- Yeah. I don't even know if I want to.

605
01:04:32,108 --> 01:04:33,779
Stop talking.

606
01:04:33,907 --> 01:04:37,457
There's the target. Bring the car round
and meet me on that corner.

607
01:04:55,427 --> 01:04:57,337
Oi, Furlong.

608
01:05:29,105 --> 01:05:31,982
Is it not true
that you work for Terry Manning?

609
01:05:32,104 --> 01:05:34,857
And in a bid to bend a jury,

610
01:05:34,984 --> 01:05:38,294
you murdered
the prosecution counsel's wife.

611
01:05:43,304 --> 01:05:47,137
But you did threaten the counsel's
unborn child with murder

612
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:50,176
if he didn't walk away from the case,
did you not?

613
01:05:54,783 --> 01:06:00,699
And lastly,
were you or were you not cleared

614
01:06:00,823 --> 01:06:03,290
of sexually assaulting a minor

615
01:06:03,422 --> 01:06:08,257
on the grounds of your special
relationships with certain police officers?

616
01:06:08,382 --> 01:06:12,773
Guilty. Kick the barrel away
and let's get the fuck out of here.

617
01:06:33,421 --> 01:06:34,900
For Christ's sake...

618
01:06:38,140 --> 01:06:41,689
You have to stop this. This is murder.

619
01:06:41,820 --> 01:06:43,811
What about your wife and kid?

620
01:06:43,940 --> 01:06:48,013
- They're not the point.
- What is the point, then, Barrister?

621
01:06:50,420 --> 01:06:53,217
If we do this, we become murderers.

622
01:06:53,339 --> 01:06:57,219
And I don't want any part of that.
How do we know if he really did it?

623
01:06:57,340 --> 01:07:00,536
Cos that's what we think?
Is that proof? Is it?

624
01:07:00,659 --> 01:07:03,174
I do this for a living.

625
01:07:04,539 --> 01:07:06,530
We need real proof.

626
01:07:06,659 --> 01:07:09,456
Beyond a reasonable doubt.

627
01:07:09,578 --> 01:07:12,457
This ain't murder. It's punishment.

628
01:07:17,498 --> 01:07:19,376
Don't you do this.

629
01:07:19,499 --> 01:07:22,729
Do it? That's what we're about.

630
01:07:22,858 --> 01:07:24,689
This is who we are, now.

631
01:07:36,058 --> 01:07:37,649
No!

632
01:07:39,537 --> 01:07:41,573
Christ, you...

633
01:08:14,135 --> 01:08:17,764
What did you fucking do that for? Eh?

634
01:08:17,895 --> 01:08:20,090
You ain't seen the last of him.

635
01:08:20,215 --> 01:08:24,766
I'm the boss, Hillier.
Don't you ever forget that.

636
01:09:03,932 --> 01:09:08,130
Listen, it's worse than I thought.
Manning's got Greaves in his pocket.

637
01:09:08,252 --> 01:09:12,290
They're doing all sorts together.
Manning will get bailed this week.

638
01:09:12,411 --> 01:09:16,451
The case will collapse. Find him.
He's the one to go for next.

639
01:09:16,572 --> 01:09:21,087
- What about Furlong?
- Fuck Furlong. He's already gone.

640
01:09:21,211 --> 01:09:24,203
It wasn't that easy.

641
01:09:24,331 --> 01:09:28,881
You let him go. For fuck's sake,
you don't know what you've done.

642
01:09:29,010 --> 01:09:32,606
Hang up now.
Yeah, don't call this number again.

643
01:09:32,731 --> 01:09:34,243
I'll contact you.

644
01:10:40,606 --> 01:10:41,959
Furlong.

645
01:10:54,406 --> 01:10:56,795
What you gonna do now... boss?

646
01:11:11,725 --> 01:11:13,317
Fuck off.

647
01:11:16,605 --> 01:11:18,482
Off you go, eh?

648
01:11:18,605 --> 01:11:20,879
Better off without me, is that it?

649
01:11:21,004 --> 01:11:23,997
Yeah, you carry on walking away
when things get tough.

650
01:11:25,564 --> 01:11:27,634
Leave all the real work to me.

651
01:11:27,764 --> 01:11:29,959
You're a joke.

652
01:11:30,084 --> 01:11:33,042
Fucking outlaws?
What a load of old bollocks that is!

653
01:11:33,164 --> 01:11:36,599
You ain't got it in ya. None of ya.

654
01:11:36,723 --> 01:11:39,476
Not a fucking one of ya!

655
01:11:39,603 --> 01:11:43,437
And all you do, boss, is give orders.

656
01:11:44,683 --> 01:11:47,276
I've never seen you once back it up.

657
01:11:47,402 --> 01:11:49,041
Not once.

658
01:11:55,962 --> 01:11:58,635
No wonder your missus
started fucking about.

659
01:12:18,361 --> 01:12:19,840
Who's coming? Who's staying?

660
01:12:22,801 --> 01:12:25,235
'According to Scotland Yard,

- Just get out.

They've killed Lewis

They don't know who you are.
You can still walk away.

- You should want to.

If they kill their own, you don't stand
a fucking chance. Now walk away.

Dump your phones and start again.

Forget we ever met. Don't make contact
with each other, whatever you do.

- Why?

I said go! Go on, fuck off!

690

For your own good. Go on.

691

Pinned him down somewhere in Essex

Do you think they'll catch him?

705

Did he kill anyone apart from Lewis?

706
01:17:13,064 --> 01:17:16,340
He didn't kill Lewis.
Greaves and Manning did.

707

You know where Bryant is, don't ya?

Frank? Drop it.

709

You can make a lot of money with that
information. He's on the wanted list.

Therapy?

713
01:17:40,263 --> 01:17:42,776
It's a shame you lot
never got round to him.

714
01:17:42,902 --> 01:17:45,336
Bryant would have loved
to have dealt with him.

715
01:17:45,462 --> 01:17:49,694
I would have come with you, but it would
have looked weird if we'd both gone.

Hey.

01:18:09,781 --> 01:18:11,055
To the groom.

718

- What a fucking way to go out, eh?
- I can think of worse ways.

719
01:18:45,619 --> 01:18:49,133
You know what you were saying
in the office about Manning?

720
01:18:49,258 --> 01:18:51,533
You know my brother Andy?

721
01:18:51,659 --> 01:18:54,616
He knows someone
who does a bit of running about for him.

722
01:18:54,738 --> 01:18:58,890
- Said Manning's lying low in the country.
- Who the fuck have you been talked to?

723
01:18:59,018 --> 01:19:02,897
- I told you earlier, friend. Drop it.
- I haven't spoken to anyone, I swear.

724
01:19:03,018 --> 01:19:06,373
- It's just my brother.
- Where in the countryside?

725
01:19:06,497 --> 01:19:10,286
Dunno. I can find out.

726
01:19:21,817 --> 01:19:23,215
Leave me alone.

- Manning made bail. Where is he?
- Kill me and you won't fucking know.

734
01:20:28,693 --> 01:20:31,491
Somebody'll talk. They always do.

735
01:20:43,812 --> 01:20:46,121
'He said Manning's lying low
in the country... '

736
01:20:46,252 --> 01:20:48,402
I will.

737

739

Be faithful to her

No.

Yes? Yes?

742
01:21:55,168 --> 01:21:57,159
There's a phone call for you, Cedric.

743

Who is it, Lucy?

744
01:21:59,848 --> 01:22:02,567
He didn't give his name.
He said you'd know who it is.

745
01:22:08,568 --> 01:22:11,445
How are you getting on?

746
01:22:11,567 --> 01:22:13,762
I've been better.

747
01:22:13,887 --> 01:22:15,764
You?

748
01:22:18,967 --> 01:22:21,161
Do you wanna do something?

749
01:22:26,446 --> 01:22:28,437
I know how to get to Manning.

750
01:22:52,845 --> 01:22:54,994
Come on! Get him! Get him!

751
01:22:57,045 --> 01:22:58,921
Come on, get back! Back!

752
01:24:07,160 --> 01:24:08,957
What did I tell you?

753
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:18,759
- Put the gun down, please.
- What... did I tell you?

754
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:23,675
- You told us not to make contact.
- For your own good.

755
01:24:30,599 --> 01:24:33,716
What were you talking about
at the restaurant with Monroe?

756
01:24:33,839 --> 01:24:38,515
Somebody say something about
Manning? I heard you say Manning.

757
01:24:44,358 --> 01:24:46,269
Tell me what you know, Dekker.

758
01:24:46,398 --> 01:24:50,107
He's in the countryside. I know where.

759
01:24:50,238 --> 01:24:53,071
- How do you know?
- I just do.

760
01:24:54,518 --> 01:24:56,235
What were you planning?

761
01:24:56,357 --> 01:24:59,270
We don't know what else to do
any more.

762
01:25:00,198 --> 01:25:03,746
We'll dump the vehicle and go on foot.
A tree line runs into the garden.

763
01:25:03,877 --> 01:25:07,916
The file says
he drives a black BMW 735i.

764
01:25:08,037 --> 01:25:10,267
And that's our entry sign.

765
01:25:10,397 --> 01:25:13,274
And once we're inside?

766
01:25:15,917 --> 01:25:17,907
Any other questions?

767
01:25:21,276 --> 01:25:25,155
It won't work. What do you think,
he's gonna be waiting for you alone?

768
01:25:25,796 --> 01:25:29,151
Even if you do kill him, they'll find you.

769
01:25:36,275 --> 01:25:38,630
You know where we'll be
if you change your mind.

770
01:25:49,635 --> 01:25:52,944
What about you two?
You've still got lives to go back to.

771
01:25:53,074 --> 01:25:57,113
You could slip under the radar,
forget we ever met.

772
01:25:58,074 --> 01:26:00,065
He's probably right.

773
01:26:01,274 --> 01:26:03,070
Chances are, we won't make it.

774
01:26:40,192 --> 01:26:41,704
Come on.

775
01:28:29,505 --> 01:28:31,178
Something's wrong.

776
01:28:31,906 --> 01:28:34,817
Upstairs.

777
01:29:13,463 --> 01:29:16,738
'Or spend the rest of your lives
getting raped by cunts like Blair?

778
01:29:16,862 --> 01:29:20,651
'Or having paedophiles
wandering the fucking playgrounds

779
01:29:20,783 --> 01:29:24,058
'while you smile mute
and pay your fucking taxes?

780
01:29:27,343 --> 01:29:29,139
'Neither do I.

781
01:29:32,142 --> 01:29:33,460
'I wanna learn how to... '

782
01:30:07,219 --> 01:30:10,212
- Get down on the floor.
- Drop the weapons.

783
01:30:26,619 --> 01:30:27,654
Go! Go!

784
01:31:04,777 --> 01:31:06,733
Come on. Come on.

785
01:31:16,296 --> 01:31:18,207
Over there. Come on.

786
01:31:24,735 --> 01:31:27,886
It's all right. It's all right.
It's just a surface wound.

787
01:31:28,015 --> 01:31:29,846
I'll live.

788
01:31:34,015 --> 01:31:37,087
- What?
- What were you doing with that gun?

789
01:31:37,935 --> 01:31:40,085
You were closer to hitting me than them.

790
01:31:40,215 --> 01:31:43,092
What? I was the one
who shot the marksman, wasn't I?

791
01:31:43,214 --> 01:31:46,013
Bollocks.
You didn't have your safety catch off.

792
01:31:46,135 --> 01:31:49,046
- Rubbish.
- Rubbish, he says. Eh? Rubbish!

793
01:31:50,214 --> 01:31:54,207
You know, Monroe? You know
something? I've never heard you swear.

794
01:31:54,334 --> 01:31:56,848
Takes a lot of doing
for a man in your shoes.

795
01:32:16,492 --> 01:32:18,563
If we go up that way, we're dead.

796
01:33:03,690 --> 01:33:05,566
Make your targets!

797
01:33:05,689 --> 01:33:07,965
Keep it sharp, lads!

798
01:34:27,524 --> 01:34:29,481
Armed police! Stand still!

799
01:34:29,605 --> 01:34:32,438
Get the murdering little fucker! Stop him!

800
01:34:32,565 --> 01:34:34,600
Do it! Kill him!

801
01:35:00,963 --> 01:35:02,521
Shit.

802
01:35:31,641 --> 01:35:33,360
Thanks, Mr Manning.

803
01:35:53,560 --> 01:35:56,710
You ain't got the bollocks, son.
