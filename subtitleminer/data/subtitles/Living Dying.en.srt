One minute!

27
00:01:34,174 --> 00:01:35,971
That's it.

28
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:45,040
Duca won't let you
get away with this.

29
00:01:45,085 --> 00:01:47,986
Did anyone say
you could talk?

30
00:01:48,021 --> 00:01:51,286
Don't-- don't hit him,
please.

31
00:01:51,324 --> 00:01:53,952
Ah! Ha!

32
00:01:55,929 --> 00:01:58,420

Fuck, man, take it easy.
Just-- just drive away.

41
00:02:34,501 --> 00:02:37,095
- All right?
- Sam! We did it.

42
00:02:37,137 --> 00:02:38,968
We pulled it off.

43
00:02:44,811 --> 00:02:47,211
- Fuck!
- Turn your engine off...

44
00:02:47,247 --> 00:02:50,045
- They're not supposed to be here yet.
- Just reverse it.

45
00:02:51,852 --> 00:02:54,047
Shit!

46
00:03:05,332 --> 00:03:06,663
- Put your weapons down...
- Shit!

47
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,962
- ...and get out of the van!
- Damn it.

48
00:03:08,001 --> 00:03:09,263
- Oh shit.
- Somebody fucked us!

49
00:03:09,302 --> 00:03:11,463
Get the fuck
out of the van!

50
00:03:13,607 --> 00:03:16,235
Get out of the van now.

51
00:03:18,111 --> 00:03:19,203
Head for the cafe.

52
00:03:42,702 --> 00:03:44,693
Ahh!

53
00:03:48,975 --> 00:03:51,341
Ahh!

54
00:03:51,378 --> 00:03:53,369
No, Nadia!

55
00:03:53,413 --> 00:03:54,903
Shit!

56
00:03:54,948 --> 00:03:56,540
Get her in there!

57
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:58,244
Ahh!

58
00:03:58,285 --> 00:03:59,946
Honey!

59
00:04:07,994 --> 00:04:10,360
What's going on
out there?

60
00:04:11,565 --> 00:04:13,499
Put the phone down.

61
00:04:13,533 --> 00:04:15,728
Put the phone down!

62
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:18,795
- Take all the money.
- Put the phone down now!

63
00:04:18,838 --> 00:04:20,931
Sam, Nadia's dying here.

64
00:04:20,974 --> 00:04:23,499
- Maybe we should call the para--
- Just stay fucking quiet!

65
00:04:23,543 --> 00:04:25,841
Bill, go check and see if
there's anyone back there.

66
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:27,972
You! You go
sit down over there.

67
00:04:28,014 --> 00:04:29,879
Everybody, sit down.

68
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:32,111
Do you have
a first-aid kit?

69
00:04:32,152 --> 00:04:33,517
- ln the back.
- All right.

70
00:04:33,553 --> 00:04:35,680
You're coming with me,
come on.

71
00:04:38,058 --> 00:04:40,151
Hey hey hey!

72
00:04:40,193 --> 00:04:42,661
Sit down. Get down
over there now.

73
00:04:48,101 --> 00:04:49,728
ls there another way
out of here?

74
00:04:49,769 --> 00:04:52,738
Maybe the back door,
but it stays bolted.

75
00:04:52,772 --> 00:04:54,205
All right, come on.

76
00:05:00,947 --> 00:05:03,541
Sit down.

77
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:05,676
Jesus, Sam, there are
cops everywhere.

78
00:05:05,719 --> 00:05:07,619
They had to know we
were gonna be there!

79
00:05:07,654 --> 00:05:09,451
Dude, what are you doing?
Get away from the window.

80
00:05:09,489 --> 00:05:10,979
Watch them.

81
00:05:11,024 --> 00:05:12,719
Oh no.

82
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:17,560
Please, Sam!
Sam, don't let me die.

83
00:05:17,597 --> 00:05:20,065
- l'm working on it.
- l don't want to die.

84
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:31,435
Sam!

85
00:05:31,478 --> 00:05:33,412
Everybody look alive.

86
00:05:33,446 --> 00:05:36,176
l don't want them sneaking out the back
door or the window, understand?

87
00:05:36,216 --> 00:05:37,240
- Yes, sir.
- Knock it out.

88
00:05:37,283 --> 00:05:38,841
Right, sir.

89
00:05:42,989 --> 00:05:44,513
McCrea, are you
in charge here?

90
00:05:44,557 --> 00:05:46,616
Yeah, right now
we're trying to secure the perimeter.

91
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:49,458
- So what do we know?
- We got three robbers inside,

92
00:05:49,496 --> 00:05:50,963
fourth one dead
in the street there.

93
00:05:50,997 --> 00:05:52,624
l didn't want to move
him till you got here.

94
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:55,066
- They said anything yet?
- No, it all happened way too fast.

95
00:05:55,101 --> 00:05:57,262
- All of them armed?
- Oh yeah, we wounded one of them.

96
00:05:57,303 --> 00:05:58,861
Might be dead,
l don't know for sure.

97
00:05:58,905 --> 00:06:01,339
All right, give me
a sniper on that roof.

98
00:06:05,078 --> 00:06:07,376
Oh no!

99
00:06:09,482 --> 00:06:11,814
Jesus, l don't know what
this shit is!

100
00:06:11,851 --> 00:06:12,977
Uh, mister?

101
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:16,182
l'm sorry-- l-l-l-l,
l went to nursing school.

102
00:06:16,222 --> 00:06:17,814

103
00:06:17,857 --> 00:06:19,347
Sam!

104
00:06:19,392 --> 00:06:20,882

106
00:06:26,366 --> 00:06:27,765
Mary Jane...

107
00:06:30,603 --> 00:06:33,197
Okay, how-- how many
times were you shot?

108
00:06:34,207 --> 00:06:35,401
Once.

109
00:06:35,442 --> 00:06:37,535
Okay, l'm gonna lift up
your shirt, okay?

110
00:06:40,213 --> 00:06:41,271
Shh.

111
00:06:41,314 --> 00:06:43,111
Ah!

112
00:06:43,149 --> 00:06:45,117
This is Detective
Rick Devlin.

113
00:06:45,151 --> 00:06:47,016
We have the area
surrounded.

114
00:06:47,053 --> 00:06:48,918
We want you
to come out unarmed,

115
00:06:48,955 --> 00:06:50,684
so no one else
gets hurt.

116
00:06:52,158 --> 00:06:53,648
What do we do?

117
00:06:53,693 --> 00:06:55,991
Um... nothing.

118
00:06:57,664 --> 00:06:59,757
Oh no!

119
00:07:01,768 --> 00:07:03,235
We need to talk
with you,

120
00:07:03,269 --> 00:07:05,260
make sure
no one else is hurt.

121
00:07:05,305 --> 00:07:06,738
What do we do, Sam?!

122
00:07:09,342 --> 00:07:11,469
Oh no!

123
00:07:12,746 --> 00:07:14,976
Listen, maybe we
should talk with him.

124
00:07:18,885 --> 00:07:20,079
lt hurts.

125
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,849
Sam, what the fuck
do we do?

126
00:07:21,888 --> 00:07:24,152
Fuck, Bill,

127
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:26,818
- Ah.
- Here we go.

128
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,157
lt's okay.

129
00:07:29,496 --> 00:07:31,157
Sam!

130
00:07:38,872 --> 00:07:40,840
Give me a direct line
of communication

131
00:07:40,874 --> 00:07:42,136
inside that building.

132
00:07:42,175 --> 00:07:43,733
Yang, cover
the back door.

133
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,740
Tables are turning
on this little shindig.

134
00:07:53,953 --> 00:07:55,648
Money in the bags...

135
00:07:57,257 --> 00:07:59,691
- where's it from, hmm?
- Duca's.

136
00:08:10,336 --> 00:08:13,100
What, do you think
you're some sort of bank robber, huh?

137
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:15,869
One of them
Western outlaws--

138
00:08:27,387 --> 00:08:30,788
All right, we're getting
the sharpshooter in position.

139
00:08:30,824 --> 00:08:32,815
ls there anything more
you know about him?

140
00:08:32,859 --> 00:08:34,656
They hit Duca's
payroll office,

141
00:08:34,694 --> 00:08:36,855
and we cornered them
in the cafe over there. That's it.

142
00:08:38,097 --> 00:08:40,429
Where do you want to set up
the command post?

143
00:08:40,466 --> 00:08:42,434
ln there.

144
00:08:43,736 --> 00:08:45,795
- Anyone called Duca yet?
- No,

145
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,307
l've been trying
to avoid the asshole.

146
00:08:50,877 --> 00:08:53,311
Hey, what do you want
to do with them?

147
00:08:54,347 --> 00:08:56,076
Leave 'em.

148
00:08:57,984 --> 00:08:59,451
And you?

149
00:08:59,485 --> 00:09:01,385
Your coffee
tastes like shit.

150
00:09:01,421 --> 00:09:03,685
Get in there and make
some new coffee.

151
00:09:03,723 --> 00:09:05,486
lt's gonna be
a long day.

152
00:09:07,493 --> 00:09:08,482
Fred.

153
00:09:10,663 --> 00:09:12,688
Hey, l'm talking
to you.

154
00:09:12,732 --> 00:09:14,791
Look, why don't you let me
make the coffee, okay?

155
00:09:14,834 --> 00:09:17,098
- l said now.
- He can't hear you.

156
00:09:17,136 --> 00:09:20,264
No, my God!
Oh my God! Oh my God!

157
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:26,205
Fred... Fred!

158
00:09:33,353 --> 00:09:35,787
He's deaf.

159
00:09:36,823 --> 00:09:38,484
He couldn't hear you.

160
00:09:38,524 --> 00:09:41,220
Well, that's his
fucking problem.

161
00:09:43,763 --> 00:09:46,664
ls anybody else gonna
have a problem doing what l say?

162
00:09:54,641 --> 00:09:56,541
Good.

163
00:09:56,576 --> 00:09:58,874
You make some coffee.

164
00:10:07,787 --> 00:10:09,516
You two, in there.

165
00:10:09,555 --> 00:10:11,819
Can you help me?

166
00:10:15,895 --> 00:10:17,920
Move them in the back.

167
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:26,163
Hodges, how long
until we're ready?

168
00:10:26,205 --> 00:10:28,196
Five minutes.
Just tying in these phones.

169
00:10:28,241 --> 00:10:30,402
What about the guy
out on the street?

170
00:10:30,443 --> 00:10:31,910
Go ahead
and pull him out.

171
00:10:31,945 --> 00:10:33,776
Yeah, and get their
van out of the way.

172
00:10:33,813 --> 00:10:36,805
Go ahead and call Duca.
Make sure he knows what's happened.

173
00:10:36,849 --> 00:10:38,749
l'm just doing
my job.

174
00:10:38,785 --> 00:10:40,184
lt's gonna
cause trouble.

175
00:10:40,219 --> 00:10:43,245
Wouldn't be a nice
day without it.

176
00:10:43,289 --> 00:10:46,281
All right, let's see
what they have to say.

177
00:10:51,364 --> 00:10:54,356
My name is Detective Pulliam
and this is Detective Devlin.

178
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,027
We need to talk
with all of you.

179
00:10:56,069 --> 00:10:58,003
Were-- were you able
to recover the money?

180
00:10:58,037 --> 00:10:59,026
Not yet, sir.

181
00:10:59,072 --> 00:11:00,733
Was anyone able to get
a good look at them?

182
00:11:00,773 --> 00:11:02,400
Do you think we'll get
all the money back?

183
00:11:02,442 --> 00:11:05,002
Right now we're not too concerned
with the money, sir.

184
00:11:05,044 --> 00:11:08,138
We need to make sure all those people
across the street stay okay.

185
00:11:08,181 --> 00:11:11,048
- But-but Mr. Duca will want--
- l don't care what Duca wants.

186
00:11:11,084 --> 00:11:13,109
What l'd like each
one of you to do

187
00:11:13,152 --> 00:11:15,552
is tell us exactly
what happened.

188
00:11:15,588 --> 00:11:17,180
How much you
figure is in here?

189
00:11:17,223 --> 00:11:19,817
$500,000, easy.

190
00:11:29,502 --> 00:11:32,062
We had it all timed out,
it should have worked.

191
00:11:32,105 --> 00:11:33,504
l want...

192
00:11:33,539 --> 00:11:35,734
l don't want to die.

193
00:11:35,775 --> 00:11:38,801
We're gonna get you fixed up. The bullet
didn't go all the way through,

194
00:11:38,845 --> 00:11:40,608
so l'm gonna
get it out, okay?

195
00:11:40,646 --> 00:11:42,910
- l don't wanna die!
- Hold her still, hold her still.

196
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:45,349
Ah!
l don't want to die.

197
00:11:45,385 --> 00:11:47,444
- Stop stop...
- l want to see Gabrielle.

198
00:11:49,489 --> 00:11:50,649
Ah ah ah!

199
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:53,124
Shh!

200
00:11:54,494 --> 00:11:57,054
Nadia! Nadia.

201
00:12:13,479 --> 00:12:16,277
She's okay.
She's okay.

202
00:12:16,315 --> 00:12:18,579
- She's just unconscious.
- She's fine?

203
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:30,357
Okay, l need to open
her airways.

204
00:12:41,574 --> 00:12:43,940
Are you gonna
answer it?

205
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:48,943
- Gonna answer it--?
- l'm thinking!

206
00:12:56,089 --> 00:12:58,990
Come on, cowboy.
You're doing the talking.

207
00:13:03,496 --> 00:13:05,930
All right,
here's the deal:

208
00:13:05,965 --> 00:13:08,661
you keep it brief,

209
00:13:08,701 --> 00:13:12,034
and you don't say
anything about us.

210
00:13:12,071 --> 00:13:14,130
- You hear me?
- Yeah.

211
00:13:19,912 --> 00:13:21,038
Hello?

212
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,413
This is
Detective Rick Devlin.

213
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:26,611
l'm calling
from across the street.

214
00:13:26,652 --> 00:13:28,176
Who am l speaking with?

215
00:13:28,221 --> 00:13:29,848
lt's Sam.

216
00:13:29,889 --> 00:13:31,413
Sam?

217
00:13:31,457 --> 00:13:33,152
All right.

218
00:13:33,192 --> 00:13:35,353
Are you in charge?

219
00:13:35,394 --> 00:13:37,726
l guess you
could say that.

220
00:13:37,763 --> 00:13:40,095
We heard gunfire.

221
00:13:40,133 --> 00:13:42,101
Are the hostages
okay?

222
00:13:44,337 --> 00:13:47,636
Yeah.
For the moment.

223
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:51,036
Sam, can your
partners hear me?

224
00:13:52,945 --> 00:13:54,537
Yeah, they can
hear you.

225
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:57,310
Okay. So what
do you want?

226
00:13:58,784 --> 00:14:00,684
Um...

227
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,848
look, we weren't
planning on this.

228
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:06,415
We need some time
to think.

229
00:14:06,459 --> 00:14:08,552
Some time?

230
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:14,857
Well, Sam, l can
give you some time

231
00:14:14,901 --> 00:14:17,836
if you send some
of the hostages out.

232
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:20,464
A sign of good faith.

233
00:14:20,506 --> 00:14:23,669
Show me you have
good intentions and l'll do the same.

234
00:14:28,447 --> 00:14:30,972
Are you there, Sam?

235
00:14:31,017 --> 00:14:33,815
Just call back
in half an hour.

236
00:14:33,853 --> 00:14:36,651
What the fuck are you doing?
Why'd you hang up on him?

237
00:14:36,689 --> 00:14:38,554
l didn't know
what to do.

238
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:40,525
l mean,
they want hostages.

239
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,791
- You want to give 'em hostages?
- Fuck no!

240
00:14:43,829 --> 00:14:46,593
l can't let any
of 'em go yet.

241
00:14:46,632 --> 00:14:49,226
Well, they want
some of these people.

242
00:14:49,268 --> 00:14:52,431
Why don't you just shut the fuck up
and get out of here?

243
00:14:52,471 --> 00:14:55,031
So do we have a plan?

244
00:14:57,176 --> 00:14:59,269
Hey, is that
coffee ready?

245
00:14:59,312 --> 00:15:01,542
Yeah, it's ready.

246
00:15:03,382 --> 00:15:05,316
Well, go on,
start pouring some coffee.

247
00:15:05,351 --> 00:15:07,581
Karl?
Karl?

248
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:10,487
Hey, who wants coffee?
Coffee?

249
00:15:10,523 --> 00:15:12,457
- Karl?
- Who wants-- you want coffee?

250
00:15:12,491 --> 00:15:14,288
- Karl...
- Coffee?

251
00:15:14,327 --> 00:15:16,557
- Karl!
- Somebody's got to want coffee.

252
00:15:16,596 --> 00:15:17,961
- Karl.
- What?!

253
00:15:17,997 --> 00:15:20,158
Do we have a plan?

254
00:15:21,767 --> 00:15:24,065
Yeah, l got a plan.

255
00:15:26,872 --> 00:15:29,136
Get the fuck out there.

256
00:15:34,046 --> 00:15:35,980
Christ.

257
00:15:38,584 --> 00:15:40,245
ls she gonna make it?

258
00:15:40,286 --> 00:15:42,982
She'll be okay.

259
00:15:47,693 --> 00:15:49,388
l don't get you,
Mary Jane--

260
00:15:49,428 --> 00:15:51,589
helping her.

261
00:15:51,631 --> 00:15:55,397
We wouldn't be in this mess
if it wasn't for them.

262
00:15:55,434 --> 00:15:57,368
l can't just let her
lie here and die.

263
00:16:01,507 --> 00:16:03,304
l'm sorry.

264
00:16:09,782 --> 00:16:12,410
How you doing, Jenny?

265
00:16:12,451 --> 00:16:15,215
l wanna go home.

266
00:16:15,254 --> 00:16:16,812
l know, sweetie.

267
00:16:16,856 --> 00:16:19,757
And we will. We're gonna
go home soon, l promise.

268
00:16:19,792 --> 00:16:22,386
Yeah, l wouldn't be
too sure about that one.

269
00:16:22,428 --> 00:16:23,725
What do you mean?

270
00:16:25,064 --> 00:16:27,032
Do you know who
these guys are?

271
00:16:27,066 --> 00:16:29,967
No, l never
saw 'em before.

272
00:16:31,637 --> 00:16:33,867
Karl Schroeder
and Max Reichman.

273
00:16:33,906 --> 00:16:36,397
They call themselves
the ''Blood Brothers.''

274
00:16:36,442 --> 00:16:38,569
They're into everything--

275
00:16:38,611 --> 00:16:43,048
drugs, murder,
human trafficking.

276
00:16:43,082 --> 00:16:46,245
l mean, they pretty much
do anything.

277
00:16:48,287 --> 00:16:51,154
l used to work
for Karl's brother.

278
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:54,591
l only met them once.

279
00:16:54,627 --> 00:16:56,754
But l mean,

280
00:16:56,796 --> 00:16:59,287
some pretty mean
bastards.

281
00:17:00,633 --> 00:17:03,830
That's enough.
You'll scare the girl.

282
00:17:03,869 --> 00:17:06,303
No, he's not.

283
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:09,706
Mom says you can trust
a man by his eyes.

284
00:17:13,145 --> 00:17:14,578
He's a good man.

285
00:17:14,613 --> 00:17:16,547
You can see it.

286
00:17:16,582 --> 00:17:18,550
He'll stop them.

287
00:17:21,253 --> 00:17:23,813
Shh shh shh.

288
00:17:23,856 --> 00:17:25,983
Hi.

289
00:17:29,628 --> 00:17:31,653
Hey.

290
00:17:31,697 --> 00:17:34,427
l saved something
for you.

291
00:17:36,135 --> 00:17:37,261
Gabrielle.

292
00:17:42,641 --> 00:17:44,074
Sam.

293
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,702
You got
to lie down, okay?

294
00:17:45,745 --> 00:17:47,838
Come on, lie back down,
sweetie.

295
00:17:49,448 --> 00:17:51,245
Lie down.

296
00:17:59,792 --> 00:18:01,657
- Lascar.
- Hey.

297
00:18:01,694 --> 00:18:03,127
- Catherine.
- Hey.

298
00:18:03,162 --> 00:18:04,959
Thanks for getting
here so quick.

299
00:18:04,997 --> 00:18:06,897
So...

300
00:18:06,932 --> 00:18:09,196
What do you want me
working on?

301
00:18:09,235 --> 00:18:11,703
l want you to look
at a surveillance video,

302
00:18:11,737 --> 00:18:13,227
find out
what they took.

303
00:18:13,272 --> 00:18:15,172
Right.
Where can l set up?

304
00:18:15,207 --> 00:18:17,038
- Back there.
- Okay.

305
00:18:19,445 --> 00:18:21,640
Uh, Rick?

306
00:18:24,417 --> 00:18:25,714
Shit.

307
00:18:25,751 --> 00:18:27,412
Rick, sorry to interrupt.

308
00:18:27,453 --> 00:18:30,650
You know Captain Burleson.
l believe you know Duca.

309
00:18:30,689 --> 00:18:32,213
Devlin.

310
00:18:32,258 --> 00:18:34,123
- Good to see you again.
- Captain.

311
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,650
We got things
under control.

312
00:18:35,694 --> 00:18:37,628
lt looks like it.
News is around the corner

313
00:18:37,663 --> 00:18:39,426
acting like a pack
of hungry wolves.

314
00:18:39,465 --> 00:18:40,955
They want to know
what's happening.

315
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,831
But first, l'd like
to know what's happening.

316
00:18:42,868 --> 00:18:45,302
Right now, l don't think
you should be involved, Mr. Duca.

317
00:18:45,337 --> 00:18:47,771
- lf you'll take a seat--
- Honey, l'm not going anywhere

318
00:18:47,807 --> 00:18:49,570
until l know l have
my money back.

319
00:18:49,608 --> 00:18:52,406
And you all know l have
a lot of powerful friends.

320
00:18:52,445 --> 00:18:55,608
We're aware of that, Mr. Duca, but for
now, why don't you go park it?

321
00:18:55,648 --> 00:18:57,741
For now he stays.
Keep him involved

322
00:18:57,783 --> 00:18:59,683
just like the rest
of us. Got it?

323
00:18:59,718 --> 00:19:02,881
So have they made
any demands?

324
00:19:02,922 --> 00:19:04,890
Nothing yet.
They're scared.

325
00:19:04,924 --> 00:19:06,824
They're trying to
decide what to do.

326
00:19:06,859 --> 00:19:08,383
What do you
have in mind?

327
00:19:08,427 --> 00:19:11,590
Bring a tactical team
together to hit the cafe.

328
00:19:13,098 --> 00:19:14,827
ln the storeroom
there's a trapdoor

329
00:19:14,867 --> 00:19:16,596
that leads
to a drainage pipe.

330
00:19:16,635 --> 00:19:18,967
We're placing two men
in position right there.

331
00:19:19,004 --> 00:19:20,938
Those pipes haven't
been used in years.

332
00:19:20,973 --> 00:19:23,533
l'm gonna send two men up the pipe
while we hit the front with tear gas.

333
00:19:23,576 --> 00:19:26,943
They'll never see our guys
coming from the back.

334
00:19:26,979 --> 00:19:28,970
l'm against
this plan entirely.

335
00:19:29,014 --> 00:19:31,505
- lt's not your call.
- But it is mine. You can't do it.

336
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:33,916
But it's the best option.
lt'll work!

337
00:19:33,953 --> 00:19:35,750
l know it'll work,
but you can't do it.

338
00:19:35,788 --> 00:19:39,053
The ATF is sending
in a hostage negotiator.

339
00:19:39,091 --> 00:19:41,423
The ATF?

340
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,257
They don't have
jurisdiction on this.

341
00:19:43,295 --> 00:19:45,593
Yeah, we got everything
under control.

342
00:19:45,631 --> 00:19:48,464
There's a dead man in the street
, and gunshots from inside.

343
00:19:48,501 --> 00:19:50,366
Sounds like some control.

344
00:19:50,402 --> 00:19:52,063
Captain, they have
no right.

345
00:19:52,104 --> 00:19:54,629
The ATF are trained in this type
of negotiation.

346
00:19:54,673 --> 00:19:57,471
They requested that one of their agents
be sent in to deal with it.

347
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:58,807
Oh, but this is crazy.

348
00:19:58,844 --> 00:20:01,608
l mean, we're trained
for hostage negotiations.

349
00:20:01,647 --> 00:20:02,739
Yeah, right.

350
00:20:02,781 --> 00:20:04,442
Why did they request
an agent come up here?

351
00:20:04,483 --> 00:20:06,212
What are you
not telling us?

352
00:20:10,389 --> 00:20:12,823
One of the robbers is
an undercover agent.

353
00:20:15,494 --> 00:20:17,189
Fuck.

354
00:20:30,442 --> 00:20:32,376
Why aren't they calling?

355
00:20:32,411 --> 00:20:33,844
They're planning.

356
00:20:33,879 --> 00:20:36,541
Just give 'em a few minutes,
they'll call back.

357
00:20:38,117 --> 00:20:40,517
- Huh-uh.
- No thing.

358
00:20:40,553 --> 00:20:43,681
l just wanted to see
if you guys had a plan.

359
00:20:43,722 --> 00:20:45,349
l got a plan.

360
00:20:45,391 --> 00:20:48,849
Sure you're not making
it up as you go?

361
00:20:53,299 --> 00:20:55,062
Hey.

362
00:20:56,569 --> 00:20:59,231
l had a plan the moment
you three walked in the door.

363
00:20:59,271 --> 00:21:02,331
So why don't you just
shut the fuck up and go sit down?

364
00:21:02,374 --> 00:21:04,968
Dude, you don't
remember me, do you?

365
00:21:08,113 --> 00:21:09,774
No.

366
00:21:11,216 --> 00:21:13,514
Come on, man.

367
00:21:13,552 --> 00:21:15,884
l used to run with
your brother down south?

368
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:20,481
Yeah, that's right,
he was picked up for arms dealing.

369
00:21:20,526 --> 00:21:23,461
No, actually, it was narcotics.
That's what l heard.

370
00:21:23,495 --> 00:21:25,986
He was working
for Octavian.

371
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,365
That's right.

372
00:21:30,402 --> 00:21:32,529
lt was Octavian.

373
00:21:32,571 --> 00:21:35,438
The son of a bitch
set him up too.

374
00:21:35,474 --> 00:21:38,170
What'd you do
for him?

375
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:39,905
Collections.

376
00:21:39,945 --> 00:21:43,278
lf somebody didn't pay on time,
l'd park a car in their living room.

377
00:21:43,315 --> 00:21:44,714
That was you?

378
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,411
- Shit, l remember that.
- Yeah yeah yeah,

379
00:21:46,452 --> 00:21:48,443
and l also remember he
kicked your ass to the wind,

380
00:21:48,487 --> 00:21:49,886
ain't that right?

381
00:21:49,922 --> 00:21:51,514
That's right.

382
00:21:54,727 --> 00:21:56,820
What do you want me
to tell 'em?

383
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,861
All right, you want
your van back...

384
00:22:06,605 --> 00:22:09,130
...and a six-seater plane,
gassed up and ready to go.

385
00:22:10,609 --> 00:22:12,406
Okay.

386
00:22:19,151 --> 00:22:20,448
Hello?

387
00:22:20,486 --> 00:22:24,820
Sam?
lt's Detective...

388
00:22:24,857 --> 00:22:27,519
just call me Rick.

389
00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:30,392
How are things
going in there?

390
00:22:31,997 --> 00:22:33,726
Pretty good
at the moment.

391
00:22:33,766 --> 00:22:35,825
Good good.

392
00:22:35,868 --> 00:22:38,837
Have you thought about
how to handle this?

393
00:22:38,871 --> 00:22:40,839
Listen,

394
00:22:40,873 --> 00:22:43,603
we're gonna want
the van back and fueled,

395
00:22:43,642 --> 00:22:47,442
and we want a six-seater plane waiting
for us at the airport.

396
00:22:47,479 --> 00:22:49,379
A plane?

397
00:22:49,415 --> 00:22:51,508
Sounds like you're
planning on running.

398
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:53,245
Yeah, you could
say that.

399
00:22:53,285 --> 00:22:55,310
That's a bad idea, Sam.

400
00:22:55,354 --> 00:22:58,448
Maybe l should be
discussing this with your partners?

401
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:01,618
Listen, l'm gonna do
all the talking for now.

402
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:04,527
How many others
are in there, Sam?

403
00:23:04,563 --> 00:23:06,622
What about the van
and the plane?

404
00:23:08,634 --> 00:23:12,126
Well, the plane's
a tall order to fill.

405
00:23:12,171 --> 00:23:16,938
So l'm gonna need
something from you in exchange.

406
00:23:16,975 --> 00:23:19,000
You need
something from me?

407
00:23:19,044 --> 00:23:21,512
Yeah.

408
00:23:21,547 --> 00:23:24,277
l'm gonna need
some hostages, Sam.

409
00:23:27,753 --> 00:23:30,085
Just hold on
for a second, okay?

410
00:23:33,525 --> 00:23:36,551
Can you hear what
they're saying?

411
00:23:36,595 --> 00:23:38,586
He's talking to someone.

412
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:40,495
- Are you there?
- Yeah.

413
00:23:40,532 --> 00:23:45,026
Sorry, man, no deal. No hostages
until we have everything, okay?

414
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,970
l can't do that, Sam.

415
00:23:47,005 --> 00:23:48,632
l need to have
some hostages.

416
00:23:48,674 --> 00:23:50,403
At least send
the women out.

417
00:23:50,442 --> 00:23:52,967
Show me you're serious about doing
this peacefully.

418
00:23:53,011 --> 00:23:54,774
Fuck-- what the fuck, man?

419
00:23:54,813 --> 00:23:56,246
- l said l can't.
- You've got to.

420
00:23:56,281 --> 00:23:59,011
Sam, we're gonna turn
the power off in there

421
00:23:59,051 --> 00:24:01,110
and it's gonna get
awfully hot, okay?

422
00:24:01,153 --> 00:24:03,678
So l'll tell you what,
give me some hostages

423
00:24:03,722 --> 00:24:06,452
and l will leave
the AC on.

424
00:24:06,492 --> 00:24:08,426
l don't know
what to do.

425
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,325
Fuck it, l'll check.

426
00:24:10,362 --> 00:24:12,296
What the fuck you
mean you'll check?

427
00:24:12,331 --> 00:24:14,561
You're in charge, asshole.
Remember?

428
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,727
Jesus!

429
00:24:18,937 --> 00:24:22,202
Look, you fuck up
like that again,

430
00:24:22,241 --> 00:24:24,334
hmm?

431
00:24:24,376 --> 00:24:27,402
l'm gonna put another
bullet in your girlfriend.

432
00:24:29,848 --> 00:24:31,509
You hear me?

433
00:24:34,419 --> 00:24:36,444
Now what did
they say?

434
00:24:38,223 --> 00:24:41,215
They said that they want
to turn the power off

435
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,854
and they want a hostage
as a sign of good faith

436
00:24:43,896 --> 00:24:46,490
and they'll give you
what you want.

437
00:24:48,167 --> 00:24:50,192
- Oh really?
- Yeah.

438
00:24:50,235 --> 00:24:52,169
What, they're
in charge now, huh?

439
00:24:52,204 --> 00:24:53,967
They making the rules?

440
00:24:54,006 --> 00:24:56,031
Fuck that.

441
00:25:23,836 --> 00:25:25,599
What's your name,
old man?

442
00:25:25,637 --> 00:25:28,470
Harold.

443
00:25:28,507 --> 00:25:30,566
Well, Harold,

444
00:25:30,609 --> 00:25:32,406
looks like
you're going home.

445
00:25:32,444 --> 00:25:35,379
No no no,
take somebody else.

446
00:25:35,414 --> 00:25:37,279
Let the girl go.

447
00:25:40,986 --> 00:25:44,114
No!
Don't hurt him!

448
00:26:00,372 --> 00:26:02,806
Get away from my baby.

449
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:11,044
Shut the fuck up.

450
00:26:19,625 --> 00:26:22,093
All right,
l'll go, l'll go.

451
00:26:23,562 --> 00:26:25,996
Just don't hurt him.
Go.

452
00:26:29,902 --> 00:26:32,097
Lay off! l'll go.

453
00:26:35,607 --> 00:26:38,906
You got a real smart
little girl here.

454
00:26:38,944 --> 00:26:40,912
Leave her alone.

455
00:26:45,817 --> 00:26:47,910
Come on, old man.

456
00:26:47,953 --> 00:26:50,444
lt's about time l talked
to those cops.

457
00:26:55,727 --> 00:26:58,719
Max, give me
that mask and jacket.

458
00:27:11,843 --> 00:27:13,401
Okay.

459
00:27:13,445 --> 00:27:15,936
Rick, they're ready.

460
00:27:15,981 --> 00:27:18,882
We should be waiting
for the ATF to get here.

461
00:27:18,917 --> 00:27:20,908
We're getting
people out, Mr. Duca.

462
00:27:20,953 --> 00:27:23,183
That's what he'll
be doing also.

463
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:27,790
There are a dozen cops
out there with guns.

464
00:27:27,826 --> 00:27:29,453
l'll be fine.

465
00:28:00,425 --> 00:28:03,394
Get those cops away from the door!
No cops on us!

466
00:28:04,396 --> 00:28:06,660
Fall back.

467
00:28:06,698 --> 00:28:08,393
Fall back.

468
00:28:08,433 --> 00:28:10,867
Bishop! Fall back.

469
00:28:12,037 --> 00:28:14,403
No shooting!
No shooting, you understand?

470
00:28:14,439 --> 00:28:16,031
They're coming out.

471
00:28:16,074 --> 00:28:18,201
Give the word,
l can get a clean shot.

472
00:28:18,243 --> 00:28:21,076
We got two more inside.

473
00:28:21,113 --> 00:28:24,310
Any shooting, they start
executing hostages, you understand me?

474
00:28:24,349 --> 00:28:26,374
l understand.

475
00:28:26,418 --> 00:28:28,409
We don't want anyone
else getting hurt.

476
00:28:28,453 --> 00:28:29,943
Well, that's right
honorable of you.

477
00:28:29,988 --> 00:28:31,580
l've got a clean shot.

478
00:28:31,623 --> 00:28:33,523
- Just give the order.
- Stay ready, do not fire.

479
00:28:33,558 --> 00:28:35,287
How many folks you
got in there?

480
00:28:35,327 --> 00:28:38,694
Hey, l'm doing the talking
right now, so you just shut the fuck up.

481
00:28:40,298 --> 00:28:42,061
You tell that sniper
to raise his rifle.

482
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,500
l don't want
no rifles on me.

483
00:28:47,806 --> 00:28:50,070
Don't do it, Rick.

484
00:28:50,108 --> 00:28:51,871
Don't let him control
the situation.

485
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:54,276
l can take him down
right now.

486
00:28:56,648 --> 00:28:58,741
Sniper, stand down.

487
00:29:00,152 --> 00:29:02,416
Raise your rifle.

488
00:29:02,454 --> 00:29:04,752
Sniper, raise your rifle.

489
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:06,553
Stand down.

490
00:29:08,326 --> 00:29:11,159
And these pigs!
Tell them to put their guns down!

491
00:29:11,196 --> 00:29:12,754
That's as far
as it goes.

492
00:29:12,798 --> 00:29:15,266
You a tough guy, huh?

493
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,200
Just keeping
the field even.

494
00:29:17,235 --> 00:29:18,862
Oh, keeping
the field even, huh?

495
00:29:18,904 --> 00:29:20,997
l like that, yeah,
keeping the field even.

496
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,769
l got seven hostages
keeping the field even, asshole!

497
00:29:23,809 --> 00:29:25,106
l'm not following you.

498
00:29:25,143 --> 00:29:27,475
You don't make
the rules anymore, man!

499
00:29:27,512 --> 00:29:29,946
You cut the power,
l start killing 'em.

500
00:29:29,981 --> 00:29:32,108
You send in tear gas,
l start popping 'em.

501
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:35,119
You try any fucking thing, l start
blowing their goddamn brains out.

502
00:29:35,153 --> 00:29:36,916
lt's real simple
to understand.

503
00:29:36,955 --> 00:29:38,650
- Look, we can work this--
- Fuck you!

504
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:41,750
Where's the plane
and where's the van?

505
00:29:43,762 --> 00:29:45,252
We're working on it.

506
00:29:45,297 --> 00:29:47,822
The plane, that is.
We're trying to get you a plane.

507
00:29:47,866 --> 00:29:50,357
You got till sundown,
asshole!

508
00:29:50,402 --> 00:29:52,927
l don't get what
l want by sundown,

509
00:29:52,971 --> 00:29:56,532
l'm gonna start killing...
one an hour.

510
00:29:57,676 --> 00:29:59,871
- You understand me?
- Yes, l understand.

511
00:29:59,911 --> 00:30:01,469
l don't think
l believe you, man.

512
00:30:01,513 --> 00:30:03,208
Do you know what
l will do to these people?

513
00:30:03,248 --> 00:30:04,715
Yes, l understand.

514
00:30:06,918 --> 00:30:08,442
All right,
back up.

515
00:30:08,487 --> 00:30:10,045
Wait.

516
00:30:10,088 --> 00:30:12,079
What about
this hostage?

517
00:30:16,061 --> 00:30:17,961
Come on.

518
00:30:17,996 --> 00:30:19,896
Give him to me
as a sign of good faith.

519
00:30:26,071 --> 00:30:27,538
Thanks.

520
00:30:27,572 --> 00:30:29,563
lt goes a long way.

521
00:30:33,478 --> 00:30:34,809
- Hold your fire!
- Shoot him!

522
00:30:34,846 --> 00:30:36,313
- Hold your fire!
- Shoot that son of a bitch!

523
00:30:36,348 --> 00:30:37,645
Somebody get that radio
away from--

524
00:30:37,682 --> 00:30:40,845
- Shoot him, shoot him! God damn it!
- Fuck you!

525
00:30:40,886 --> 00:30:43,116
- Fuck you!
- Shut up!

526
00:30:49,861 --> 00:30:51,692
- God damn!
- You showed 'em.

527
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:53,391
Fuckin' pansy.

528
00:30:53,431 --> 00:30:55,729
Don't be showing me what to do.
l'll tell them what to do.

529
00:30:55,767 --> 00:30:57,462
Fuck them!

530
00:30:57,502 --> 00:30:59,333
- l think they got the message.
- You think?

531
00:31:00,772 --> 00:31:03,468
That guy-- that guy's chest--

532
00:31:03,508 --> 00:31:06,443
Hey. Hey!

533
00:31:06,478 --> 00:31:09,072
You didn't need
to fuckin' shoot him.

534
00:31:10,849 --> 00:31:12,476
What'd you say?

535
00:31:12,517 --> 00:31:14,508
You didn't have
to fucking shoot him.

536
00:31:16,087 --> 00:31:17,918
Oh see, yeah--
yeah, l did.

537
00:31:17,956 --> 00:31:21,289
'Cause see,
l can't let nobody

538
00:31:21,326 --> 00:31:23,123
know our little
secret here.

539
00:31:23,161 --> 00:31:24,788
Can l?

540
00:31:24,829 --> 00:31:26,854
At least not yet.

541
00:31:26,898 --> 00:31:29,423
You could have just
brought him back in.

542
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:35,706
No, l had to make him
the lesson!

543
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:39,471
You fuckin' bastard.

544
00:31:43,882 --> 00:31:45,782
Just let me fuckin'
shoot her, Karl.

545
00:31:45,817 --> 00:31:47,944
- Let me do it, man!
- l'm sick and tired

546
00:31:47,986 --> 00:31:49,544
of your fucking mouth.

547
00:31:49,588 --> 00:31:51,920
The next time you mouth off to me,
l will let him shoot you.

548
00:31:51,957 --> 00:31:54,187
l swear to God.

549
00:31:54,226 --> 00:31:56,091
Hey.

550
00:31:56,127 --> 00:31:58,027
Hey, l bet we're
on the news.

551
00:31:58,063 --> 00:31:59,758
Hey, go turn on
that TV, come on.

552
00:31:59,798 --> 00:32:01,425
Come on, come on!

553
00:32:01,466 --> 00:32:02,899
Get over there.

554
00:32:08,607 --> 00:32:11,098
Channel 3 News
has confirmed that

555
00:32:11,142 --> 00:32:13,508
the hostage crisis
at the Desert Wind Cafe...

556
00:32:30,195 --> 00:32:31,719
l don't like this.

557
00:32:34,666 --> 00:32:37,499
Duca's gonna turn this
into a media frenzy.

558
00:32:43,275 --> 00:32:45,539
They're gonna turn this
around on us, you know?

559
00:32:45,577 --> 00:32:48,341
They always do.

560
00:32:50,282 --> 00:32:51,977
You okay?

561
00:32:52,017 --> 00:32:53,712
l shouldn't have
trusted him.

562
00:32:53,752 --> 00:32:55,913
Hey Rick, don't make
that your fault.

563
00:32:55,954 --> 00:32:59,048
You did a great job.
The guy's a psycho.

564
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:01,615
lt would have ended
badly no matter what.

565
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:04,254
Yeah well, he's running
the show now.

566
00:33:04,296 --> 00:33:07,231
Hi, Ann Nobel,
lnternational News.

567
00:33:07,265 --> 00:33:09,256
Sir? We heard gunfire.

568
00:33:09,301 --> 00:33:12,702
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a very
serious situation occurring.

569
00:33:12,737 --> 00:33:14,762
l need to make
my statements brief,

570
00:33:14,806 --> 00:33:17,400
and then l'll hand it
over to Mr. Duca

571
00:33:17,442 --> 00:33:18,909
and he'll speak
for a while.

572
00:33:18,943 --> 00:33:21,241
- Mr. Duca--
- At 9:00 a.m. this morning,

573
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:24,180
four armed suspects entered
the payroll offices

574
00:33:24,215 --> 00:33:25,648
of Duca Enterprises.

575
00:33:25,684 --> 00:33:27,743
They're considered
extremely dangerous,

576
00:33:27,786 --> 00:33:29,811
and have stolen an undetermined
amount of money.

577
00:33:29,854 --> 00:33:31,947
- Sir? We heard gunfire--
- Ladies and gentlemen,

578
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:34,891
as Duca Enterprises is
the town's largest employer,

579
00:33:34,926 --> 00:33:38,862
we are keeping Mr. Duca involved through
every step of this process.

580
00:33:38,897 --> 00:33:40,922
ln the meantime,
Mr. Duca.

581
00:33:40,965 --> 00:33:45,163
Mr. Duca, what do you say
about your hostages?

582
00:33:47,605 --> 00:33:49,937
Well, the ATF guy is here.

583
00:33:49,974 --> 00:33:52,943
He's waiting for you
in the command center.

584
00:33:52,977 --> 00:33:55,445
- Thanks.
- You're gonna love this guy.

585
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,845
Why?

586
00:33:56,881 --> 00:33:58,041
You'll see.

587
00:33:58,083 --> 00:34:00,449
He's a fuckin'
piece of work.

588
00:34:10,695 --> 00:34:12,458
You must be Devlin.

589
00:34:15,734 --> 00:34:17,395
Agent Lind.

590
00:34:17,435 --> 00:34:19,460
You got here fast.

591
00:34:19,504 --> 00:34:21,631
Well, l would have
been here a lot sooner

592
00:34:21,673 --> 00:34:24,801
but l was working
on another situation up north.

593
00:34:24,843 --> 00:34:27,334
This is
Detective Pulliam.

594
00:34:27,379 --> 00:34:29,574
Hi.

595
00:34:29,614 --> 00:34:31,138
Yeah.

596
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:34,484
Tough break about
that hostage,

597
00:34:34,519 --> 00:34:36,316
but, uh,
shit happens, l guess.

598
00:34:36,354 --> 00:34:39,323
l'm here to straighten
everything out.

599
00:34:39,357 --> 00:34:41,120
What are your plans?

600
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:44,822
Well, l'm gonna get
a conversation going.

601
00:34:44,863 --> 00:34:47,593
l've got an officer
on the inside.

602
00:34:47,632 --> 00:34:49,725
l'll try to get him
on the phone.

603
00:34:49,768 --> 00:34:52,737
You mind telling us how
your officer got in there?

604
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,940
Oh, thank you.

605
00:34:57,976 --> 00:35:00,342
Well...

606
00:35:00,378 --> 00:35:04,337
we've been tracking this little group
for about a year now.

607
00:35:04,382 --> 00:35:08,318
They've been peddling guns and drugs
to a couple of different outfits

608
00:35:08,353 --> 00:35:11,652
and we heard about
their plans for the robbery,

609
00:35:11,689 --> 00:35:15,318
but it wasn't supposed to be
till the end of the month.

610
00:35:16,461 --> 00:35:20,454
We were gonna have
officers on the inside, but...

611
00:35:20,498 --> 00:35:22,022
l don't know.

612
00:35:22,066 --> 00:35:24,796
Something went wrong.
Just...

613
00:35:24,836 --> 00:35:28,203
didn't work out.

614
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:30,833
Well, maybe
your guy turned?

615
00:35:41,753 --> 00:35:44,381
Okay.

616
00:35:44,422 --> 00:35:47,255
Listen,

617
00:35:47,292 --> 00:35:50,318
l'm assuming command
of this whole thing here.

618
00:35:50,361 --> 00:35:52,022
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

619
00:35:52,063 --> 00:35:55,897
Assuming command? We were told you
were coming in to negotiate this.

620
00:35:58,503 --> 00:36:00,437
Well, l guess you
heard wrong, honey,

621
00:36:00,472 --> 00:36:03,669
'cause, like l said,

622
00:36:03,708 --> 00:36:06,438
l've got an officer
on the inside,

623
00:36:06,478 --> 00:36:10,847
and that gives me all
the authority that l need

624
00:36:10,882 --> 00:36:13,680
to take over
this little rodeo.

625
00:36:19,991 --> 00:36:22,459
Well,

626
00:36:22,494 --> 00:36:24,894
the man has
nice boots.

627
00:36:27,632 --> 00:36:29,327
For those of you
just joining us,

628
00:36:29,367 --> 00:36:31,597
three unnamed assailants
have taken the patrons

629
00:36:31,636 --> 00:36:33,866
of the Desert Wind
Cafe hostage

630
00:36:33,905 --> 00:36:37,068
following the morning robbery
of Duca Enterprises payroll...

631
00:36:42,814 --> 00:36:45,374
Why'd you do this?

632
00:36:45,416 --> 00:36:48,044
Hmm?

633
00:36:48,086 --> 00:36:49,747
For her.

634
00:36:52,223 --> 00:36:56,125
My ex is an abusive prick.

635
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,651
When l left him,

636
00:36:58,696 --> 00:37:01,096
he took custody
of my daughter,

637
00:37:01,132 --> 00:37:04,329
and, um, took her
to France

638
00:37:04,369 --> 00:37:07,099
and wouldn't even
let me talk to her.

639
00:37:07,138 --> 00:37:10,266
What does stealing money
have to do with your ex?

640
00:37:10,308 --> 00:37:13,869
My first priority is
my daughter Gabrielle.

641
00:37:13,912 --> 00:37:16,210
l need the money
to get her back.

642
00:37:16,247 --> 00:37:20,013
Yeah well, l don't think that's gonna
be happening now.

643
00:37:20,051 --> 00:37:22,485
- Why?
- What?

644
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,954
Why'd you lose your daughter
in the first place?

645
00:37:24,989 --> 00:37:28,755
He had lots of connections
and lots of money.

646
00:37:28,793 --> 00:37:32,058
lt really wasn't that hard for him
to take Gabrielle away from us.

647
00:37:34,832 --> 00:37:38,290
No, the government doesn't
let you just take a child

648
00:37:38,336 --> 00:37:39,963
and move them
to another country

649
00:37:40,004 --> 00:37:42,199
without permission
from both parents.

650
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,175
They do when you
have money.

651
00:38:02,894 --> 00:38:04,122
Hello?

652
00:38:04,162 --> 00:38:07,928
This is Agent Lind
with the ATF.

653
00:38:07,966 --> 00:38:10,196
Am l speaking
with Sam?

654
00:38:10,234 --> 00:38:11,792
Where the fuck
is Rick?

655
00:38:11,836 --> 00:38:13,030
Well...

656
00:38:13,071 --> 00:38:16,131
l'm taking over
dealing with your...

657
00:38:16,174 --> 00:38:18,165
demands.

658
00:38:18,209 --> 00:38:19,301
And...

659
00:38:19,344 --> 00:38:20,936
we just need
to talk--

660
00:38:20,979 --> 00:38:23,777
l don't want to talk to you, man.
l wanna talk to Rick.

661
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:30,779
Well, it's all me
from now on, pal.

662
00:38:30,822 --> 00:38:34,417
And you're not gonna have to deal
with the locals anymore.

663
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,394
All right, man.
Go ahead, fucking talk.

664
00:38:40,198 --> 00:38:42,666
How many hostages
do you have?

665
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,361
l can't tell you
that, man.

666
00:38:44,402 --> 00:38:46,165
You better
tell me something.

667
00:38:46,204 --> 00:38:49,071
Because if we're gonna
make this work,

668
00:38:49,107 --> 00:38:53,271
we need to establish
a mutual trust.

669
00:38:53,311 --> 00:38:55,074
You give me something,

670
00:38:55,113 --> 00:38:56,444
l give you something.

671
00:38:56,481 --> 00:38:58,415
That's the way
it's gonna work.

672
00:38:58,449 --> 00:38:59,848
Dude!

673
00:38:59,884 --> 00:39:01,909
You are barking up
the wrong tree.

674
00:39:01,953 --> 00:39:03,716
You saw what
happened last time.

675
00:39:03,755 --> 00:39:05,814
Do you want anyone
else getting hurt?

676
00:39:05,857 --> 00:39:08,724
- 'Cause we don't.
- No no, we don't.

677
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:12,093
Well, then l fucking suggest you get
the van and the plane together

678
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:14,997
so we can all fucking
get this over with.

679
00:39:18,803 --> 00:39:20,703
There ain't gonna
be any van,

680
00:39:20,738 --> 00:39:23,070
and there ain't
gonna be any plane

681
00:39:23,107 --> 00:39:26,076
until you give up
some hostages,

682
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:28,476
or what you stoled.

683
00:39:28,513 --> 00:39:29,707
What's it gonna be?

684
00:39:29,747 --> 00:39:31,612
Are you
a fucking idiot?

685
00:39:31,649 --> 00:39:33,913
Do you want more
people to die?

686
00:39:33,951 --> 00:39:36,886
Give me the fucking phone!
Let me explain something:

687
00:39:36,921 --> 00:39:38,445
lf you keep up
with this shit,

688
00:39:38,489 --> 00:39:40,457
l'm gonna start
executing some hostages.

689
00:39:40,491 --> 00:39:42,391
Sam, is this you?

690
00:39:42,427 --> 00:39:45,487
Hello? Hello?

691
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:47,430
- God damn it!
- What?

692
00:39:47,465 --> 00:39:49,365
Those sons of bitches!

693
00:39:51,569 --> 00:39:53,560
Fuck!

694
00:39:53,604 --> 00:39:57,267
Hello-- get 'em back
on the line.

695
00:39:57,308 --> 00:39:59,139
Get 'em on the line.

696
00:39:59,177 --> 00:40:01,168
God!

697
00:40:04,615 --> 00:40:07,482
l don't think even Jesus
can plug that many holes.

698
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:16,121
Well, let's see if they're
ready to play nice.

699
00:40:19,731 --> 00:40:21,824
Christ in Heaven
Almighty.

700
00:40:21,866 --> 00:40:24,926
- Hello?
- Hey, you listening now?

701
00:40:24,969 --> 00:40:27,597
Hey.

702
00:40:32,577 --> 00:40:34,636
How many people
were hurt?

703
00:40:34,679 --> 00:40:36,078
That don't matter.

704
00:40:36,114 --> 00:40:39,311
Now are you ready to stop
making demands?

705
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:49,218
l tell you what
l need to make this work.

706
00:40:50,728 --> 00:40:52,821
You really want
to see people die, don't you?

707
00:40:52,864 --> 00:40:54,889
l need
to come in, okay?

708
00:40:54,932 --> 00:40:56,524
l just need
to walk in.

709
00:40:56,567 --> 00:40:58,797
l just want to take
a look, that's all.

710
00:40:58,836 --> 00:41:00,997
l just want to walk in,
take a look

711
00:41:01,038 --> 00:41:03,404
and just talk to you.
l'm not even armed, okay?

712
00:41:03,441 --> 00:41:05,705
lt's never
gonna happen.

713
00:41:05,743 --> 00:41:08,303
l just want to take
a look, that's all.

714
00:41:10,615 --> 00:41:12,139
l am coming to you live

715
00:41:12,183 --> 00:41:14,583
from the Duca Enterprises
payroll office,

716
00:41:14,619 --> 00:41:18,612
as four armed suspects
held it up this morning.

717
00:41:20,358 --> 00:41:21,950
Hey, are you watching
Channel 3?

718
00:41:21,993 --> 00:41:23,290
No.

719
00:41:23,327 --> 00:41:25,124
Should l be?

720
00:41:32,136 --> 00:41:33,398
All right.

721
00:41:33,437 --> 00:41:36,736
...executed in front
of the cafe by a robber

722
00:41:36,774 --> 00:41:37,968
as the police watched.

723
00:41:38,009 --> 00:41:40,500
That reporter--
she can come in

724
00:41:40,545 --> 00:41:42,103
with the camera.

725
00:41:42,146 --> 00:41:45,582
- l know she's not a cop.
- ...and the other three...

726
00:41:50,154 --> 00:41:53,282
You like her, huh?

727
00:41:53,324 --> 00:41:55,417
Okay.

728
00:41:55,459 --> 00:41:57,051
Guess what?

729
00:41:57,094 --> 00:41:59,392
l ain't gonna send
a reporter in there.

730
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:01,523
Well, she comes in,

731
00:42:01,566 --> 00:42:03,625
or no one come in.
That's the rule.

732
00:42:08,472 --> 00:42:10,497
Get that reporter
in here.

733
00:42:10,541 --> 00:42:12,168
Go get her.

734
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:14,440
- What, do you got shit in your ear?
- l heard him!

735
00:42:14,478 --> 00:42:17,311
- Move!
- Hey, l mean, you can't be serious?

736
00:42:17,348 --> 00:42:18,872
You can't even
be thinking that!

737
00:42:18,916 --> 00:42:20,008
Oh, l am thinking that.

738
00:42:20,051 --> 00:42:21,951
l'm thinking
a mile a minute.

739
00:42:21,986 --> 00:42:24,420
And you better
hush yourself up

740
00:42:24,455 --> 00:42:27,253
'cause l know a lot more
about this than you do--

741
00:42:27,291 --> 00:42:29,851
honey.

742
00:42:29,894 --> 00:42:32,863
lf he calls me honey one more time,
l'm gonna shoot him myself.

743
00:42:32,897 --> 00:42:34,831
l know.
The guy's an asshole.

744
00:42:34,866 --> 00:42:37,198
Just focus on what
we got to do, all right?

745
00:42:37,235 --> 00:42:39,795
Think about those people
across the street.

746
00:42:39,837 --> 00:42:41,964
Come on,
let's get to work.

747
00:42:48,913 --> 00:42:50,972
You sure you're
okay with this?

748
00:42:51,015 --> 00:42:53,779
Okay?
This is a chance of a lifetime.

749
00:42:53,818 --> 00:42:55,809
l'll get a promotion
for this.

750
00:42:55,853 --> 00:42:57,377
Yeah, but it's
dangerous.

751
00:42:57,421 --> 00:42:59,719
l know the risks.

752
00:42:59,757 --> 00:43:01,588
Nothing dangerous
is gonna happen

753
00:43:01,626 --> 00:43:04,424
as long as you don't
do something stupid.

754
00:43:05,162 --> 00:43:07,130
You know what
to do, ma'am.

755
00:43:07,164 --> 00:43:10,759
l'll make sure to get as many of them
on the camera as possible.

756
00:43:10,801 --> 00:43:13,065
As soon as l know
everything is fine,

757
00:43:13,104 --> 00:43:15,197
l head back out.

758
00:43:15,239 --> 00:43:17,571
We'll be watching you
from the command center.

759
00:43:17,608 --> 00:43:21,374
You walk in, you turn around,
you walk out. Got it?

760
00:43:21,412 --> 00:43:23,073
Let's do it.

761
00:44:10,261 --> 00:44:12,991
She's outside,
she's ready to come in.

762
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:14,588
She's unarmed.

763
00:44:14,632 --> 00:44:16,998
She's too pretty
to kill.

764
00:44:30,247 --> 00:44:33,216
All right, listen, l'm gonna have
to pat you down, okay?

765
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:36,048
l don't like this being
broadcast live.

766
00:44:36,087 --> 00:44:38,055
Me neither.

767
00:44:38,089 --> 00:44:40,956
Jesus Christ,
this is how it works:

768
00:44:40,992 --> 00:44:43,722
you can look around
and you can see that everybody's okay,

769
00:44:43,761 --> 00:44:45,991
but you keep the camera
on my face, okay?

770
00:44:46,030 --> 00:44:47,622
- You understand?
- Yeah.

771
00:44:47,665 --> 00:44:50,657
All right, follow me.

772
00:44:52,503 --> 00:44:55,529
Well, there's four
hostages visible.

773
00:44:55,573 --> 00:44:58,098
Why keep the camera
on his face?

774
00:44:58,142 --> 00:45:01,270
lt's staged. They don't want the camera
to see something.

775
00:45:02,813 --> 00:45:06,374
There's one suspect,
and another hostage.

776
00:45:06,417 --> 00:45:09,352
Where'd that second
camera come from?

777
00:45:09,387 --> 00:45:12,083
lt's a micro-camera.
lt's a cell-phone camera.

778
00:45:12,123 --> 00:45:14,091
- lt's a backup.
- Oh, you idiot.

779
00:45:14,125 --> 00:45:16,923
- Hey!
- Hey, why don't you go shopping?

780
00:45:16,961 --> 00:45:20,397
- Sorry, no questions.
- No, just a couple of questions.

781
00:45:20,431 --> 00:45:22,456
What the hell
is she doing?

782
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:25,298
ls there something you
want to say to the people?

783
00:45:25,336 --> 00:45:27,327
Why are you
doing this?

784
00:45:27,371 --> 00:45:29,532
Look, you can
get your view...

785
00:45:29,573 --> 00:45:31,473
What's going on?

786
00:45:31,509 --> 00:45:33,340
Why not let
the hostages go?

787
00:45:35,579 --> 00:45:36,944
What is this shit?

788
00:45:36,981 --> 00:45:38,881
- Nothing.
- This is a camera.

789
00:45:38,916 --> 00:45:41,282
- No no--
- You brought a second fucking camera!

790
00:45:41,318 --> 00:45:43,912
- Damn it!
- No--!

791
00:45:43,954 --> 00:45:45,285
You'd better do something.

792
00:45:45,322 --> 00:45:46,914
All right.

793
00:45:46,957 --> 00:45:50,825
Shut it down.
Shut the whole damn thing down.

794
00:45:50,861 --> 00:45:52,692
Cut off the main
camera transmission.

795
00:45:52,730 --> 00:45:54,459
l want a direct
line only.

796
00:45:54,498 --> 00:45:57,490
Alpha unit, are you
in position down in the pipe?

797
00:45:57,535 --> 00:46:00,595
- Alpha unit's ready.
- Stand down, Officer!

798
00:46:00,638 --> 00:46:02,629
Catherine, get the outside team
ready.

799
00:46:02,673 --> 00:46:05,107
l told you to stand down.
You stop right there!

800
00:46:05,142 --> 00:46:06,541
Hey, we're on again!

801
00:46:06,577 --> 00:46:08,545
No, please!

802
00:46:08,579 --> 00:46:11,742
- Come on!
- Please!

803
00:46:11,782 --> 00:46:14,046
Please,
l'm begging you, no!

804
00:46:14,085 --> 00:46:16,883
No! Ah!
No, please, no!

805
00:46:16,921 --> 00:46:18,320
- No!
- Come here.

806
00:46:18,355 --> 00:46:21,415
You want to watch something?
Huh? You want to see something?

807
00:46:24,195 --> 00:46:26,425
Ah, no!
l'm begging you--!

808
00:46:26,464 --> 00:46:29,297
Shut up!
Shut the fuck up!

809
00:46:29,333 --> 00:46:30,994
Shut up, shut up.

810
00:46:31,035 --> 00:46:33,003
You like being
on camera, huh?

811
00:46:33,037 --> 00:46:35,130
- No no no no no no no no.
- You like it?

812
00:46:35,172 --> 00:46:37,663
No! No!

813
00:46:37,708 --> 00:46:40,404
Don't fight me!
Do not fucking fight me!

814
00:46:40,444 --> 00:46:43,743
- You hear me?
- No!

815
00:46:43,781 --> 00:46:45,806
- No no!
- Yeah? Yeah?

816
00:46:45,850 --> 00:46:48,751
No no, please...

817
00:46:48,786 --> 00:46:50,947
Stand the fuck up,
stand up!

818
00:46:50,988 --> 00:46:53,513
- Turn around!
- Ah!

819
00:46:53,557 --> 00:46:56,583
No! No! No!

820
00:46:59,930 --> 00:47:02,592
- Now get up...!
- Jesus.

821
00:47:02,633 --> 00:47:05,193
Alpha unit,
on my mark, you go in.

822
00:47:05,236 --> 00:47:07,136
- l repeat--
- Hey.

823
00:47:07,171 --> 00:47:08,866
l thought l told you
to stand down, didn't l?

824
00:47:08,906 --> 00:47:10,635
He's raping her.

825
00:47:10,674 --> 00:47:13,199
There's already one dead person
because of you.

826
00:47:13,244 --> 00:47:15,906
l don't need
anybody else executed

827
00:47:15,946 --> 00:47:18,244
from some half-baked
counterplan.

828
00:47:18,282 --> 00:47:20,182
Devlin, he's right.

829
00:47:20,217 --> 00:47:23,015
lt won't work.
They'll kill everyone.

830
00:47:23,053 --> 00:47:25,715
We still don't know what's
happening in the main room.

831
00:47:25,756 --> 00:47:27,815
No!

832
00:47:27,858 --> 00:47:30,088
Say it, say it.

833
00:47:31,162 --> 00:47:32,891
God damn it,
say it.

834
00:47:34,498 --> 00:47:36,261
All units, stand down.

835
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:39,565
l repeat,
all units stand down.

836
00:47:39,603 --> 00:47:41,833
- Alpha unit coming out.
- Thank you.

837
00:47:41,872 --> 00:47:45,239
l want to know which one
of them is your officer.

838
00:47:46,644 --> 00:47:48,373
Ah!

839
00:47:48,412 --> 00:47:50,312
Come here!

840
00:47:54,818 --> 00:47:57,787
No!

841
00:47:57,821 --> 00:48:01,279
Yeah.

842
00:48:01,325 --> 00:48:03,589
Stop it. l'll blow
your fucking head off!

843
00:48:03,627 --> 00:48:05,822
Just take it,
take it.

844
00:48:07,131 --> 00:48:09,691
No! No!

845
00:48:09,733 --> 00:48:12,861
- No... no, please.
- Fuck!

846
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:17,871
Ah!

847
00:48:20,411 --> 00:48:22,038
No, please God!

848
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:24,912
No, please,
l'm begging you!

849
00:48:24,949 --> 00:48:26,940
- You wanna sit?
- No!

850
00:48:26,984 --> 00:48:29,282
No! No!

851
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:31,379
Shut up!
Take it!

852
00:48:31,422 --> 00:48:32,446
Huh?

853
00:49:02,453 --> 00:49:05,786
All right,
back to the tables.

854
00:49:05,823 --> 00:49:07,757
Let's go.

855
00:49:07,791 --> 00:49:10,055
Ah... come on,
come on.

856
00:49:11,495 --> 00:49:13,292
Okay.

857
00:49:39,556 --> 00:49:41,649
- Can l go check on her?
- No.

858
00:49:41,692 --> 00:49:44,058
She stays alone.

859
00:49:45,963 --> 00:49:47,794
That was quick.

860
00:49:51,335 --> 00:49:52,893
l worked up
an appetite.

861
00:49:52,936 --> 00:49:53,925
l'll bet, yeah.

862
00:49:53,971 --> 00:49:56,496
A little hungry.

863
00:49:56,540 --> 00:49:57,837
Piece of shit.

864
00:50:00,144 --> 00:50:02,874
What'd you say?

865
00:50:06,984 --> 00:50:08,884
That's what l thought.

866
00:50:13,557 --> 00:50:16,651
Why don't you go in the kitchen and cook
us up some food, all right?

867
00:50:16,694 --> 00:50:18,685
Something nice.

868
00:50:19,697 --> 00:50:21,597
Steaks.
Steaks?

869
00:50:21,632 --> 00:50:23,600
- Mm, steaks sound good.
- Yeah?

870
00:50:25,669 --> 00:50:27,728
Come on, let's go,
let's go.

871
00:50:32,843 --> 00:50:34,902
You, go help her.

872
00:50:34,945 --> 00:50:36,537
l'm not leaving
my daughter.

873
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:37,706
Shut up!

874
00:50:40,117 --> 00:50:41,914
Yeah, you are.

875
00:50:59,403 --> 00:51:02,429
l've been trying.

876
00:51:02,473 --> 00:51:04,304
They're just
not answering.

877
00:51:04,341 --> 00:51:05,808
Give 'em some time.

878
00:51:05,843 --> 00:51:07,640
Let's go see
what's going on.

879
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:12,011
So now what?

880
00:51:12,049 --> 00:51:13,482
Well...

881
00:51:13,517 --> 00:51:15,815
the van is
on its way back.

882
00:51:17,054 --> 00:51:19,420
But we need
to buy some time.

883
00:51:19,456 --> 00:51:22,482
So l don't want
to give it to them

884
00:51:22,526 --> 00:51:24,357
until the deadline.

885
00:51:27,631 --> 00:51:30,099
l can't do this
by myself.

886
00:51:34,438 --> 00:51:36,201
l need some help.

887
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:37,537
l need two men.

888
00:51:38,842 --> 00:51:40,139
For what?

889
00:51:40,177 --> 00:51:43,772
l'd like to send them
into the sewer tunnel

890
00:51:43,814 --> 00:51:45,406
underneath the building,

891
00:51:45,449 --> 00:51:48,350
have them run a camera
up through that trapdoor in the back.

892
00:51:48,385 --> 00:51:50,615
Then we can see what
the hell is going on inside--

893
00:51:50,654 --> 00:51:53,646
Whoa whoa whoa, we don't even know if
there's anyone in that room.

894
00:51:53,690 --> 00:51:56,215
Why don't you use
the air conditioning?

895
00:51:58,395 --> 00:52:01,364
There's air conditioning
ducts that run

896
00:52:01,398 --> 00:52:06,062
between the cafe
and the upstairs apartments.

897
00:52:06,103 --> 00:52:09,231
Snake it through the vent
and into the dining room.

898
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:12,240
ls that doable?

899
00:52:12,276 --> 00:52:14,039
Yeah, that'll work.

900
00:52:14,077 --> 00:52:15,374
What do you say?

901
00:52:15,412 --> 00:52:17,437
Okay.
Let's do it.

902
00:52:17,614 --> 00:52:20,481
With Channel 3's
Ann Nobel now being

903
00:52:20,517 --> 00:52:23,247
held as hostage,
police officials continue...

904
00:52:25,155 --> 00:52:27,453
- You okay?
- Yeah.

905
00:52:27,491 --> 00:52:29,652
Hey, Max, l'm on TV.

906
00:52:29,693 --> 00:52:31,923
Yeah yeah yeah.

907
00:52:31,962 --> 00:52:34,487
Hey, you got any
chips back there?

908
00:52:34,531 --> 00:52:37,091
All right, how are we
gonna get out of this?

909
00:52:37,134 --> 00:52:39,261
We're working on it.

910
00:52:40,737 --> 00:52:43,103
l don't think you should
do anything else.

911
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:45,370
We have an idea.

912
00:52:45,409 --> 00:52:47,070
Honey,

913
00:52:47,110 --> 00:52:49,943
does your mom have
a cell phone in her purse?

914
00:52:52,216 --> 00:52:53,513
Yeah.

915
00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:55,609
We need to get it.

916
00:53:19,376 --> 00:53:21,310
Hey! What are you doing?

917
00:53:21,345 --> 00:53:22,744
What?

918
00:53:22,779 --> 00:53:25,043
What are you doing?

919
00:53:26,517 --> 00:53:29,680
Um, l was...
looking for some gum.

920
00:53:37,861 --> 00:53:39,795
Thanks.

921
00:53:42,599 --> 00:53:44,567
Did you get it?

922
00:54:05,789 --> 00:54:07,120
So now what?

923
00:54:07,157 --> 00:54:10,354
Now we find a way
to make a call outside.

924
00:54:10,394 --> 00:54:12,521
We need to get Karl's
attention somewhere else,

925
00:54:12,563 --> 00:54:14,155
so Sam can
make phone call.

926
00:54:14,197 --> 00:54:16,427
Okay, l-l--
l'll talk to him.

927
00:54:16,466 --> 00:54:19,435
Can you talk to him
out of this room?

928
00:54:37,955 --> 00:54:40,116
Um, excuse me?

929
00:54:42,292 --> 00:54:44,760
l need to use
the restroom.

930
00:54:46,730 --> 00:54:48,698
l really
need to pee.

931
00:54:51,501 --> 00:54:52,991
Please.

932
00:55:02,212 --> 00:55:04,112
All right.

933
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:09,810
But l watch.

934
00:55:09,853 --> 00:55:12,151
l don't want you
going anywhere.

935
00:55:17,661 --> 00:55:20,562
You're gonna take
care of her, right?

936
00:55:47,691 --> 00:55:49,124
Fuck, hurry hurry.

937
00:55:49,159 --> 00:55:51,389
Yep?

938
00:55:51,428 --> 00:55:53,794
Yeah.

939
00:55:58,602 --> 00:56:01,162
Hello?

940
00:56:01,204 --> 00:56:04,298
Rick, they just patched
this call through from 911,

941
00:56:04,341 --> 00:56:06,468
from across the street.

942
00:56:07,978 --> 00:56:09,309
This is Devlin.

943
00:56:09,346 --> 00:56:10,779
- Hey, it's Sam.
- Sam, what--?

944
00:56:10,814 --> 00:56:12,406
Listen, l just
want to tell you

945
00:56:12,449 --> 00:56:14,280
we're not holding
anybody hostage.

946
00:56:14,317 --> 00:56:17,309
Two guys came in here
and took over this morning.

947
00:56:17,354 --> 00:56:20,255
Their names are Karl Schroeder
and Max Reichman.

948
00:56:20,290 --> 00:56:22,451
Look them up,
you'll find their warrants.

949
00:56:22,492 --> 00:56:25,859
These guys are insane. l just want
to tell you that it's not us.

950
00:56:25,896 --> 00:56:27,659
All right, Sam,
l hear you.

951
00:56:27,698 --> 00:56:29,723
But how do l know
l can trust you?

952
00:56:29,766 --> 00:56:31,461
What the fuck
am l supposed to do?

953
00:56:31,501 --> 00:56:33,230
Walk out
the goddamn door?

954
00:56:33,270 --> 00:56:35,636
They're fucking killing
people in here--

955
00:56:35,672 --> 00:56:37,902
this was not
supposed to happen.

956
00:56:40,010 --> 00:56:44,777
All right, but we're gonna
need to work together, okay?

957
00:56:44,815 --> 00:56:46,783
What do you
want me to do?

958
00:56:46,817 --> 00:56:49,786
Your partner Bill,
he's a cop.

959
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:51,811
A cop?

960
00:56:51,855 --> 00:56:53,686
l don't have time
to explain.

961
00:56:53,724 --> 00:56:55,248
Bill should have
a backup gun.

962
00:56:55,292 --> 00:56:56,816
Tell him you know
who he is

963
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:59,328
- and to use it.
- Bill's dead. Max killed him.

964
00:57:00,964 --> 00:57:02,488
Sam?

965
00:57:02,532 --> 00:57:04,227
Sam?

966
00:57:11,041 --> 00:57:13,566
- What are you doing?
- l'm just checking her wound.

967
00:57:13,610 --> 00:57:15,510
Let me see.

968
00:57:21,084 --> 00:57:23,951
- Mm, that looks painful.
- Yes.

969
00:57:23,987 --> 00:57:25,614
Ah!

970
00:57:25,655 --> 00:57:28,351
Shit!

971
00:57:35,198 --> 00:57:37,826
Don't you dare do that
to me again.

972
00:57:45,408 --> 00:57:47,342
Ah! God!

973
00:57:53,416 --> 00:57:56,351
Hey, food's ready.

974
00:57:56,386 --> 00:57:59,082
You're lucky
l'm hungry, bitch.

975
00:58:13,069 --> 00:58:15,663
Should we tell Lind
his guy is dead?

976
00:58:15,705 --> 00:58:17,935
- No.
- lt might get him to leave.

977
00:58:17,974 --> 00:58:19,566
l don't want
anyone to know.

978
00:58:19,609 --> 00:58:21,372
- Well, can you trust this guy?
- Guys?

979
00:58:21,411 --> 00:58:23,345
You might want
to see this.

980
00:58:33,190 --> 00:58:36,023
- Okay.
- What do you have?

981
00:58:36,059 --> 00:58:38,653
This is the surveillance
footage from the vault.

982
00:58:38,695 --> 00:58:41,664
l've been watching it to get some idea
of who the suspects are.

983
00:58:41,698 --> 00:58:44,690
And l found something
that just doesn't make any sense.

984
00:58:44,734 --> 00:58:46,759
Take a look at this.

985
00:58:54,611 --> 00:58:56,044
Hmm?

986
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:58,843
Okay, so what's
the point?

987
00:58:58,882 --> 00:59:00,907
Well, the point is this:

988
00:59:02,485 --> 00:59:04,009
These are the
vault ledgers.

989
00:59:04,054 --> 00:59:06,352
They keep records of
the money and locations.

990
00:59:06,389 --> 00:59:08,880
Now if you scroll down here,

991
00:59:08,925 --> 00:59:11,155
this is all the money
on the first shelf.

992
00:59:11,194 --> 00:59:13,424
Each amount is
recorded here.

993
00:59:13,463 --> 00:59:16,023
Now down here,

994
00:59:16,066 --> 00:59:19,160
here's supposed to be
the money she took.

995
00:59:19,202 --> 00:59:20,965
According to the
morning's records,

996
00:59:21,004 --> 00:59:23,529
there is not supposed
to be any money there.

997
00:59:23,573 --> 00:59:25,234
So it's a screw-up.

998
00:59:26,276 --> 00:59:28,574
Look at the money
they are taking.

999
00:59:28,612 --> 00:59:29,738
lf it's a screw-up,

1000
00:59:29,779 --> 00:59:32,475
it's a very
expensive one.

1001
00:59:32,515 --> 00:59:34,608
Let's get the manager
back in here,

1002
00:59:34,651 --> 00:59:36,050
find out what's
going on.

1003
00:59:54,371 --> 00:59:57,670
l'm sorry for all the trouble
l brought you into.

1004
00:59:57,707 --> 00:59:59,140
Yeah.

1005
01:00:05,482 --> 01:00:08,007
How long has it been
since you've seen her?

1006
01:00:09,886 --> 01:00:12,252
Over a year.

1007
01:00:12,289 --> 01:00:14,484
l miss her so much.

1008
01:00:14,524 --> 01:00:17,823
Her father wouldn't even
tell me if she's okay...

1009
01:00:19,229 --> 01:00:21,493
That's not right,
you know.

1010
01:00:23,366 --> 01:00:27,234
A father taking a child that
far away from her mother.

1011
01:00:27,270 --> 01:00:29,465
l don't care how much
money he has.

1012
01:00:29,506 --> 01:00:33,067
l-- l don't know why
you're talking like this.

1013
01:00:34,411 --> 01:00:37,209
l'm not-- l'm not
justifying what they've done.

1014
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:40,580
No, l would hope not.

1015
01:00:43,987 --> 01:00:45,955
She's a criminal.

1016
01:00:45,989 --> 01:00:49,117
There's probably a very good reason
why her daughter's gone.

1017
01:00:49,159 --> 01:00:50,956
- Alice.
- What?

1018
01:00:50,994 --> 01:00:52,621
lt's okay, it's okay.

1019
01:00:55,532 --> 01:00:58,899
You don't know anything
about me, that's right.

1020
01:01:03,039 --> 01:01:07,339
You look like somebody
who's been comfortable most of her life.

1021
01:01:07,377 --> 01:01:09,641
You chose crime,

1022
01:01:09,679 --> 01:01:13,274
while the rest of us
are out there working for our money.

1023
01:01:13,316 --> 01:01:16,046
You'd endanger the life
of your own child.

1024
01:01:17,454 --> 01:01:20,981
l would never--
l would never hurt Gabrielle.

1025
01:01:26,997 --> 01:01:28,521
l was a very good mother.

1026
01:01:28,565 --> 01:01:30,760
Well, good mothers
aren't thieves.

1027
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:35,100
Okay, all right. Alice, how long have
we known each other, huh?

1028
01:01:35,138 --> 01:01:36,867
Wha--?

1029
01:01:36,906 --> 01:01:40,569
lf something happened to Jenny,
you would go to the ends of the earth

1030
01:01:40,610 --> 01:01:41,804
to get her back.

1031
01:01:41,845 --> 01:01:44,211
This is a mother who has
a daughter that needs her,

1032
01:01:44,247 --> 01:01:45,908
just like you, honey.

1033
01:01:45,949 --> 01:01:48,144
l don't like
what l've done.

1034
01:01:48,184 --> 01:01:49,981
But l've done it.

1035
01:01:50,020 --> 01:01:51,715
l've learned my lesson.

1036
01:01:51,755 --> 01:01:54,155
And you're gonna get
your daughter back.

1037
01:01:54,190 --> 01:01:56,317
l know it.

1038
01:01:57,794 --> 01:01:59,887
Thank you, you've been
so kind to me.

1039
01:01:59,929 --> 01:02:03,387
Sorry for getting you
into this.

1040
01:02:06,403 --> 01:02:09,964
Well, l can't blame you two for what
they're doing, right?

1041
01:02:19,916 --> 01:02:21,440
What is that?

1042
01:02:21,484 --> 01:02:23,714
lt ain't fucking
Santa Claus.

1043
01:02:23,753 --> 01:02:25,152
Fuck!

1044
01:02:29,059 --> 01:02:32,256
Hey fuck!

1045
01:02:32,295 --> 01:02:34,661
- Get me the asshole.
- Uh, hold on.

1046
01:02:34,697 --> 01:02:36,824
Rick, they're on
the phone!

1047
01:02:40,670 --> 01:02:43,332
- This is Devlin.
- Who the fuck is on the roof?

1048
01:02:43,373 --> 01:02:45,739
The roof?

1049
01:02:45,775 --> 01:02:47,834
Shit!

1050
01:02:53,483 --> 01:02:55,644
- Think they're gone?
- Sam?

1051
01:02:55,685 --> 01:02:58,586
- Way they're running around up there?
- We need to get Bill's gun.

1052
01:02:58,621 --> 01:03:01,681
l know.

1053
01:03:01,925 --> 01:03:04,485
What the hell
is going on?

1054
01:03:04,527 --> 01:03:06,825
- Are those my men up there?
- They're running the camera.

1055
01:03:06,863 --> 01:03:09,661
- Shit. McCrea, what unit?
- Echo team, and Foster's down.

1056
01:03:09,699 --> 01:03:11,860
They shot right through
the fucking ceiling.

1057
01:03:11,901 --> 01:03:13,596
l need a medic!
South side!

1058
01:03:13,636 --> 01:03:15,695
- l'm on it.
- Are you happy?

1059
01:03:15,738 --> 01:03:18,639
Not yet, l'm not. We're gonna get every
single one of them.

1060
01:03:18,675 --> 01:03:20,836
- Where's the van?
- lt's not coming.

1061
01:03:20,877 --> 01:03:23,675
Not coming? Captain, what the fuck
is he talking about?

1062
01:03:23,713 --> 01:03:27,706
Detective-- uh, we just figured that
it's easier to keep 'em contained here.

1063
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:30,480
Now we're gonna bring
the teams in through the front door,

1064
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:32,010
and through
the sewer duct.

1065
01:03:32,055 --> 01:03:34,683
- That was my plan all along!
- lt's a good plan.

1066
01:03:34,724 --> 01:03:37,989
Minimum casualties!
lt's our best option.

1067
01:03:38,027 --> 01:03:41,155
Best option? Maybe hours ago.
Now they'll be waiting for us.

1068
01:03:41,197 --> 01:03:43,222
They're gonna execute
those people.

1069
01:03:43,266 --> 01:03:46,292
Like l said,
it's the best plan!

1070
01:03:46,336 --> 01:03:50,272
Leave it up to us!
We know exactly what we're doing.

1071
01:03:50,306 --> 01:03:52,331
Yeah? ls this how
you guys handled Waco?

1072
01:03:52,375 --> 01:03:54,707
Hey hey hey, what are you looking at?
Do something!

1073
01:03:54,744 --> 01:03:57,372
Hey, Detective, deal with it
or l'll relieve you.

1074
01:04:00,350 --> 01:04:04,810
Good. Now Duca and l,
we're gonna go talk to the press.

1075
01:04:06,422 --> 01:04:07,855
Lind, you coming?

1076
01:04:09,859 --> 01:04:12,384
No!

1077
01:04:14,097 --> 01:04:16,065
Rick?

1078
01:04:16,099 --> 01:04:17,999
Rick?

1079
01:04:20,436 --> 01:04:23,234
What do you want me
to do with the manager?

1080
01:04:23,273 --> 01:04:25,104
Uh...

1081
01:04:25,141 --> 01:04:27,200
have someone take him
down to the station.

1082
01:04:27,243 --> 01:04:28,403
Right.

1083
01:04:28,444 --> 01:04:30,935
Um, for now, keep quiet
about the money, okay?

1084
01:04:30,980 --> 01:04:34,609
After what l just heard,
you know it.

1085
01:04:34,651 --> 01:04:38,143
Lascar, don't let Duca
see him here.

1086
01:04:42,959 --> 01:04:45,553
l can't believe
this shit.

1087
01:04:49,732 --> 01:04:51,757
Excuse me?

1088
01:04:51,801 --> 01:04:54,998
That reporter in the back, can l please
bring her some of your food?

1089
01:04:55,038 --> 01:04:57,233
Hey, what are
you doing?

1090
01:04:57,273 --> 01:04:59,867
- l'm gonna get that gun.
- Mary Jane, no.

1091
01:04:59,909 --> 01:05:02,605
Please, just something
to drink? Just some water?

1092
01:05:02,645 --> 01:05:04,545
All right.

1093
01:05:04,581 --> 01:05:06,378
Bring her some food.

1094
01:05:07,383 --> 01:05:09,715
- Thank you.
- Come on, come on.

1095
01:05:19,562 --> 01:05:20,995
Please.

1096
01:05:21,030 --> 01:05:23,760
You're scaring her.
Can l have just a minute alone with her?

1097
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:25,665
Oh, hell no.
What are you talking about?

1098
01:05:25,702 --> 01:05:27,727
What am l gonna do?
There's no windows in here.

1099
01:05:27,770 --> 01:05:29,738
l'm not gonna go anywhere.
Please.

1100
01:05:31,908 --> 01:05:33,034
Please.

1101
01:05:33,076 --> 01:05:34,441
All right, l'll be right
outside the door.

1102
01:05:34,477 --> 01:05:36,138
- You got one minute.
- Okay.

1103
01:05:43,086 --> 01:05:44,883
You should eat
something!

1104
01:05:47,924 --> 01:05:50,324
Yeah, we're gonna
be fine.

1105
01:05:53,363 --> 01:05:56,457
What, what--?

1106
01:06:04,641 --> 01:06:06,302
30 seconds.

1107
01:06:07,810 --> 01:06:09,277
Okay.

1108
01:06:14,450 --> 01:06:16,042
Oh my God,
you're bleeding.

1109
01:06:16,085 --> 01:06:17,245
Don't.

1110
01:06:17,287 --> 01:06:19,380
Are we going to
be okay?

1111
01:06:19,422 --> 01:06:21,083
Are we going
to be okay?

1112
01:06:21,124 --> 01:06:24,423
We're gonna be okay.
l promise we're gonna get out of this.

1113
01:06:24,460 --> 01:06:26,451
l don't think
l can do this.

1114
01:06:26,496 --> 01:06:28,464
l am going crazy.

1115
01:06:28,498 --> 01:06:31,160
l can't do this...

1116
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:33,464
He... he touched me.

1117
01:06:37,907 --> 01:06:40,637
Hey hey, what the hell
is going on in here?

1118
01:06:40,677 --> 01:06:41,905
- Ahhh!
- Whoa whoa!

1119
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:46,607
Stop it!

1120
01:06:48,284 --> 01:06:50,479
Come on!
Go go.

1121
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:52,112
Oh, thank God.

1122
01:06:52,155 --> 01:06:53,850
What's happening?

1123
01:06:53,890 --> 01:06:55,482
He killed her.
He just shot her.

1124
01:06:55,525 --> 01:06:56,753
Oh, shit!

1125
01:06:56,793 --> 01:07:00,251
- What the fuck?
- Fuckin' bitch clawed me.

1126
01:07:02,965 --> 01:07:05,331
You! Clean him up!

1127
01:07:05,368 --> 01:07:07,768
Ah, l will.
l can do it.

1128
01:07:14,477 --> 01:07:16,707
ln here, this way.

1129
01:07:24,921 --> 01:07:27,651
l'll get it,
l'll get it.

1130
01:07:33,996 --> 01:07:35,122
What?

1131
01:07:35,164 --> 01:07:37,564
Get us out of here.
Get us out of here.

1132
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:39,261
We killed another one.
Are you happy?

1133
01:07:39,302 --> 01:07:40,860
l need to use
the phone.

1134
01:07:40,903 --> 01:07:43,497
Okay, thanks.

1135
01:07:43,539 --> 01:07:44,836
So?

1136
01:07:44,874 --> 01:07:47,468
They confirmed everything,
just like you thought.

1137
01:07:47,510 --> 01:07:50,479
l got a very bad
feeling about this.

1138
01:07:50,513 --> 01:07:52,845
l've been hearing that
a lot today.

1139
01:07:53,916 --> 01:07:55,781
Go round up Lascar
and Bishop.

1140
01:07:55,818 --> 01:07:57,115
What's going on?

1141
01:07:57,153 --> 01:07:59,178
l'll tell you
when you get back.

1142
01:08:08,264 --> 01:08:09,561
This is Devlin.

1143
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:11,760
lt's getting pretty
fucking crazy in here.

1144
01:08:11,801 --> 01:08:14,133
- Where's my van, dickwad?
- We need to get out of here.

1145
01:08:14,170 --> 01:08:16,638
Just hang
in there, Sam.

1146
01:08:16,672 --> 01:08:18,902
Something's about
to go down.

1147
01:08:18,941 --> 01:08:22,001
l want you to listen
carefully.

1148
01:08:22,044 --> 01:08:23,170
Fuck you, man!

1149
01:08:23,212 --> 01:08:25,407
Where? Okay.

1150
01:08:25,448 --> 01:08:27,382
- Okay.
- Everyone's dead.

1151
01:08:27,417 --> 01:08:29,908
- No, l'm telling you, man.
- Where's my van?

1152
01:08:29,952 --> 01:08:31,419
Fuck, shit.

1153
01:08:31,454 --> 01:08:33,581
l'm getting sick and tired
of this bullshit.

1154
01:08:33,623 --> 01:08:36,751
- l'm freaking out, man.
- This is the last phone call.

1155
01:08:36,793 --> 01:08:39,694
Phone is off the hook
until l get my van!

1156
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:53,031
So what's
going on?

1157
01:08:53,075 --> 01:08:55,305
We're taking Duca down.
Follow me.

1158
01:08:58,881 --> 01:09:02,282
Can you believe the way
that little son of a bitch talked to me?

1159
01:09:02,318 --> 01:09:03,979
Calm down.

1160
01:09:07,990 --> 01:09:10,322
All right,
everything's under control.

1161
01:09:10,359 --> 01:09:12,156
We're gonna move on
to the next phase.

1162
01:09:12,195 --> 01:09:13,992
ls that so?

1163
01:09:15,998 --> 01:09:19,798
Detective Pulliam,
please put Mr. Duca in cuffs.

1164
01:09:19,836 --> 01:09:21,531
lt would be
my pleasure.

1165
01:09:21,571 --> 01:09:24,438
What?
Are you out of your mind?

1166
01:09:24,474 --> 01:09:27,705
- You can't-- get out of here!
- Hey hey hey hey hey!

1167
01:09:27,743 --> 01:09:29,233
Get off me!

1168
01:09:29,278 --> 01:09:30,939
Hey hey hey hey,
what are you doing here?

1169
01:09:30,980 --> 01:09:33,540
Take your hands
off him!

1170
01:09:33,583 --> 01:09:36,381
Captain, l'm placing
these two under arrest.

1171
01:09:36,419 --> 01:09:39,786
- You're out of your mind.
- Devlin, l'll have your badge for this.

1172
01:09:39,822 --> 01:09:41,756
You want to explain
yourself, Devlin?

1173
01:09:41,791 --> 01:09:45,158
The money in Duca's vault was being
used for a shipment of illegal weapons.

1174
01:09:45,194 --> 01:09:46,559
This is outrageous!

1175
01:09:46,596 --> 01:09:48,894
We already got a confession
from your manager.

1176
01:09:48,931 --> 01:09:51,456
And this one's not
even a cop.

1177
01:09:51,501 --> 01:09:53,765
l had Catherine call
the ATF field office.

1178
01:09:53,803 --> 01:09:55,668
They don't have
an Agent Lind,

1179
01:09:55,705 --> 01:09:58,503
- and they never sent anybody down here.
- You're out of your mind.

1180
01:09:58,541 --> 01:10:00,509
My guess is he
works for Duca.

1181
01:10:00,543 --> 01:10:03,979
And they were trying to get the money
back before anybody found out.

1182
01:10:04,013 --> 01:10:07,244
- Cuff him.
- Hey hey hey hey.

1183
01:10:07,283 --> 01:10:09,615
- Hey hey hey.
- Hey!

1184
01:10:09,652 --> 01:10:11,381
- Get off of me!
- Hey.

1185
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:13,581
- Whoa whoa whoa whoa.
- Stay right there.

1186
01:10:13,623 --> 01:10:16,319
Take it easy, Lind.
Put the gun down.

1187
01:10:16,359 --> 01:10:18,327
Eat shit!

1188
01:10:18,361 --> 01:10:20,852
ls it true?
You work for Duca?

1189
01:10:20,897 --> 01:10:22,831
Don't say
a goddamn word.

1190
01:10:22,865 --> 01:10:25,800
- Shut up.
- You're gonna die here, Lind.

1191
01:10:25,835 --> 01:10:29,271
You've got guns trained on you
from every direction.

1192
01:10:29,305 --> 01:10:31,603
Give the word, l can
take him anytime you say.

1193
01:10:31,641 --> 01:10:33,438
l ain't going down
for this asshole.

1194
01:10:33,476 --> 01:10:34,909
Well then,
let's make a deal.

1195
01:10:36,445 --> 01:10:39,573
Why are you
protecting him?

1196
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:42,709
Don't say a goddamn word,
you piece of shit--

1197
01:10:42,752 --> 01:10:44,515
l told you to shut up!

1198
01:10:46,722 --> 01:10:49,190
l can end this right now.
Just give me the shot.

1199
01:10:49,225 --> 01:10:51,284
Everybody stay calm.

1200
01:10:52,562 --> 01:10:55,497
God damn it, give the order.
l can take him.

1201
01:10:55,531 --> 01:10:58,796
You know what? He thought the money
was gonna get away.

1202
01:10:58,834 --> 01:11:01,029
And the dealers were
gonna blame it on him.

1203
01:11:01,070 --> 01:11:04,198
- Are you out of your mind?
- Just give me the goddamn order.

1204
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:06,606
- l'll burn you for this!
- This is my shot, l can take him.

1205
01:11:06,642 --> 01:11:08,542
l'll fucking destroy
your life!

1206
01:11:08,578 --> 01:11:10,443
l think l told you
to shut the fuck up!

1207
01:11:10,479 --> 01:11:12,071
Now!

1208
01:11:19,922 --> 01:11:21,890
Clear clear!

1209
01:11:21,924 --> 01:11:24,290
Medic, get a medic.

1210
01:11:24,327 --> 01:11:26,261
Paramedics!

1211
01:11:26,295 --> 01:11:28,991
Get the paramedics
over here!

1212
01:11:34,403 --> 01:11:36,894
- Good shooting.
- Thanks.

1213
01:11:39,175 --> 01:11:41,370
Let's clear this up.

1214
01:11:41,410 --> 01:11:43,878
l got dibs
on the boots.

1215
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:46,142
God damn!

1216
01:11:47,350 --> 01:11:48,908
He's fucking nuts,
man.

1217
01:11:48,951 --> 01:11:51,613
They keep killing each other,
who am l gonna kill?

1218
01:11:51,654 --> 01:11:53,019
What's going on
out there?

1219
01:11:53,055 --> 01:11:55,956
Apparently, the money
in the bags was for weapons.

1220
01:11:55,992 --> 01:11:59,758
l guess the bust
outside went bad.

1221
01:11:59,795 --> 01:12:02,764
So are they even paying
attention to us now?

1222
01:12:02,798 --> 01:12:05,266
Uh, yeah,
more so than ever.

1223
01:12:05,301 --> 01:12:06,495
l guarantee it.

1224
01:12:06,535 --> 01:12:08,662
Do you think they'll
actually let us out of here?

1225
01:12:08,704 --> 01:12:10,171
We're gonna get
out of here.

1226
01:12:10,206 --> 01:12:12,265
Don't worry,
l promise.

1227
01:12:12,308 --> 01:12:15,072
Hey hey, what's
all the whispering, huh?

1228
01:12:15,111 --> 01:12:17,602
We were just wondering
what's going on outside.

1229
01:12:19,782 --> 01:12:21,716
What's that?

1230
01:12:23,019 --> 01:12:25,852
Um, it's--
it's in my purse.

1231
01:12:25,888 --> 01:12:28,413
lt's right here.
Wait.

1232
01:12:28,457 --> 01:12:31,255
Get the fuck away!

1233
01:12:31,293 --> 01:12:33,784
Hey!

1234
01:12:33,829 --> 01:12:37,458
Chill, man.

1235
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:38,990
l found it.

1236
01:12:48,344 --> 01:12:50,335
Get down.

1237
01:12:53,983 --> 01:12:55,610
Who's George?

1238
01:12:55,651 --> 01:13:00,315
That-- that's my husband.
He's expecting us.

1239
01:13:07,897 --> 01:13:10,092
Man, you watch 'em.

1240
01:13:13,469 --> 01:13:15,460
l gotta take
a piss.

1241
01:13:22,878 --> 01:13:25,005
Max.

1242
01:13:25,047 --> 01:13:27,208
Max?

1243
01:13:27,249 --> 01:13:28,910
Why the hell
are you doing this?

1244
01:13:28,951 --> 01:13:31,852
Shut your face,
all right?

1245
01:13:31,887 --> 01:13:35,653
Max, do you know how you're
going to get out of this?

1246
01:13:35,691 --> 01:13:38,319
The cops will never
let you drive away.

1247
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:40,624
Who said we're driving there,
gutshot? Huh?

1248
01:13:40,663 --> 01:13:42,961
What the fuck else
are you gonna do?

1249
01:13:42,998 --> 01:13:45,523
l don't know.
Maybe...

1250
01:13:45,568 --> 01:13:48,298
Maybe we'll let
the cops come in here,

1251
01:13:48,337 --> 01:13:50,362
and shoot all of you

1252
01:13:50,406 --> 01:13:52,704
and then Karl and l will
just be a couple of survivors

1253
01:13:52,742 --> 01:13:55,040
with a half a million dollars cash,
how about that?

1254
01:13:55,077 --> 01:13:56,738
Max.

1255
01:13:58,981 --> 01:14:02,348
Of course you know, hey,
that's just one plan.

1256
01:14:05,621 --> 01:14:08,249
Max, it's never
gonna work.

1257
01:14:09,258 --> 01:14:11,726
Oh yeah?
Hmm?

1258
01:14:11,761 --> 01:14:12,955
You wanna bet?

1259
01:14:12,995 --> 01:14:14,622
- Yeah.
- Hey.

1260
01:14:16,766 --> 01:14:19,234
- Hi.
- Fuck.

1261
01:14:19,268 --> 01:14:21,463
What's the plan?

1262
01:14:22,671 --> 01:14:24,696
We're bringing
the van in, Captain.

1263
01:14:24,740 --> 01:14:28,437
When they come out,
we'll hit them hard and fast.

1264
01:14:28,477 --> 01:14:30,240
Let's do
this thing.

1265
01:14:30,279 --> 01:14:31,906
You heard him.

1266
01:14:34,517 --> 01:14:37,145
Hey, Max, l got a genius
fucking idea--

1267
01:14:38,287 --> 01:14:39,845
Hey, Karl.

1268
01:14:39,889 --> 01:14:42,483
Guess what?
l got my old gun back.

1269
01:14:44,393 --> 01:14:46,258
You stupid
son of a bitch.

1270
01:14:46,295 --> 01:14:48,525
Hey look, Karl, they were
pretty fuckin' fast.

1271
01:14:48,564 --> 01:14:50,759
Max, shut
the fuck up.

1272
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:53,200
Well...

1273
01:14:53,235 --> 01:14:55,100
this is gonna
be bloody.

1274
01:14:58,040 --> 01:15:00,304
- Get 'em out of here.
- Go!

1275
01:15:00,342 --> 01:15:01,707
Can't let you do that!

1276
01:15:10,052 --> 01:15:12,748
Sam! Max has got
the other gun!

1277
01:15:21,564 --> 01:15:23,555
What the hell's
going on?

1278
01:15:30,806 --> 01:15:32,865
Max?

1279
01:15:32,908 --> 01:15:34,205
You alive?

1280
01:15:34,243 --> 01:15:36,837
You shot me,
you fuck!

1281
01:15:36,879 --> 01:15:40,110
Gonna kill you, l swear
to God, l'm gonna kill you!

1282
01:15:40,149 --> 01:15:42,709
Sorry, partner,
it's a selfish business.

1283
01:15:42,751 --> 01:15:45,549
- She's been shot.
- Lay her down, lay her down.

1284
01:15:46,555 --> 01:15:49,547
Miriam, you're gonna
be okay, okay?

1285
01:15:50,559 --> 01:15:53,357
l want you to kill
those motherfuckers.

1286
01:16:03,272 --> 01:16:04,864
Grab the phone.

1287
01:16:04,907 --> 01:16:06,670
Let 'em know
what's going on.

1288
01:16:10,346 --> 01:16:11,711
Hello?

1289
01:16:11,747 --> 01:16:13,681
- l've got them on the phone.
- Hello?

1290
01:16:13,716 --> 01:16:15,274
They're shooting
at us.

1291
01:16:15,317 --> 01:16:17,785
There's one
in the backroom,

1292
01:16:17,820 --> 01:16:21,187
and we're stuck here in the middle.
Please, help us.

1293
01:16:35,304 --> 01:16:37,829
You gotta help us!
Get us out of here!

1294
01:16:37,873 --> 01:16:39,670
All units, go.

1295
01:16:39,708 --> 01:16:40,936
All units, go!

1296
01:16:56,058 --> 01:16:57,685
How are you holding up?

1297
01:16:57,726 --> 01:16:59,853
l'm doing the best
l can.

1298
01:17:02,865 --> 01:17:05,163
Mom, l'm scared.

1299
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:08,169
l know, honey.
l know.

1300
01:17:11,073 --> 01:17:13,098
Ah!

1301
01:17:16,645 --> 01:17:18,670
What do l do, Karl?

1302
01:17:18,714 --> 01:17:20,443
Just hang tight.

1303
01:17:23,519 --> 01:17:25,180
- Sam?
- What?

1304
01:17:25,220 --> 01:17:27,313
- l'm sorry.
- For what?

1305
01:17:27,356 --> 01:17:29,586
For getting us
into this.

1306
01:17:29,625 --> 01:17:32,560
Honey, we started
this together,

1307
01:17:32,594 --> 01:17:34,494
and we're gonna
end this together.

1308
01:17:34,530 --> 01:17:36,521
We're gonna
have our life,

1309
01:17:36,565 --> 01:17:39,295
and we're gonna
have Gabrielle. Okay?

1310
01:17:40,502 --> 01:17:41,969
Thank you, Sam.

1311
01:17:42,004 --> 01:17:43,437
Thank you.

1312
01:17:55,451 --> 01:17:57,442
l'm hurting
pretty bad, Karl!

1313
01:17:57,486 --> 01:17:58,748
Quit your bitching.

1314
01:17:58,787 --> 01:18:00,812
Stay with me.

1315
01:18:00,856 --> 01:18:03,324
Just hang in there, man.

1316
01:18:03,359 --> 01:18:05,020
l'm gonna finish this
right now.

1317
01:19:23,272 --> 01:19:25,399
Throw your weapon down.

1318
01:19:26,809 --> 01:19:28,868
Throw your
weapon down!

1319
01:19:34,883 --> 01:19:37,010
Karl?

1320
01:19:37,052 --> 01:19:39,145
Your boyfriend's dead.

1321
01:19:39,188 --> 01:19:42,157
l'd give up
if l were you.

1322
01:19:48,430 --> 01:19:50,227
Don't twitch.

1323
01:19:50,265 --> 01:19:52,233
You neither, bitch.

1324
01:19:52,267 --> 01:19:53,825
Sam!

1325
01:19:53,869 --> 01:19:56,030
Stay back.

1326
01:19:56,071 --> 01:19:58,096
How we gonna end this?

1327
01:19:59,842 --> 01:20:01,707
One of us living,

1328
01:20:01,743 --> 01:20:03,472
one of us dying.

1329
01:20:06,115 --> 01:20:07,946
Probably so.

1330
01:20:15,891 --> 01:20:17,483
Oh shit.

1331
01:20:26,635 --> 01:20:29,297
You're gonna be okay.
We're gonna get out of here.

1332
01:22:03,198 --> 01:22:05,496
Alpha team secure.
l'm bringing 'em out!

1333
01:22:05,534 --> 01:22:08,697
We need medics.
One of the hostages is down.

1334
01:22:10,439 --> 01:22:13,203
- Where are the others?
- Everyone else is dead.

1335
01:22:13,242 --> 01:22:14,732
Where's Sam?

1336
01:22:14,776 --> 01:22:17,074
- You mean the robbers?
- Yeah.

1337
01:22:17,112 --> 01:22:20,206
They're dead.
They're dead.

1338
01:22:40,035 --> 01:22:42,230
l got three down
back here.

1339
01:22:52,347 --> 01:22:53,939
Oh shit.

1340
01:23:11,733 --> 01:23:14,065
Rick?
ls something wrong?

1341
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:20,330
What's the matter?

1342
01:23:20,375 --> 01:23:22,639
You recognize
one of these people?

1343
01:23:24,613 --> 01:23:25,841
No.

1344
01:23:47,135 --> 01:23:48,966
How are you
holding up?

1345
01:23:53,842 --> 01:23:55,833
Much better now.

1346
01:24:00,215 --> 01:24:02,547
- Sam?
- Yeah?

1347
01:24:03,685 --> 01:24:06,313
l couldn't have done
this without you.

1348
01:24:07,322 --> 01:24:09,415
l love you.

1349
01:24:09,458 --> 01:24:11,619
l love you too.

1350
01:24:20,102 --> 01:24:22,332
Put the gun down.

1351
01:24:25,640 --> 01:24:27,073
Put it down, Sam.

1352
01:24:27,109 --> 01:24:29,577
Put yours down,
Rick.

1353
01:24:29,611 --> 01:24:32,512
Don't make this hard.

1354
01:24:32,547 --> 01:24:35,277
You're the one
making this hard.

1355
01:24:42,924 --> 01:24:44,983
Oh my God.

1356
01:24:45,026 --> 01:24:46,857
l thought we were
fucked back there.

1357
01:24:46,895 --> 01:24:49,056
Hey, partner,
shit happens.

1358
01:24:49,097 --> 01:24:50,359
People got killed.

1359
01:24:50,399 --> 01:24:52,799
Just means
more for us.

1360
01:24:52,834 --> 01:24:54,927
They think Max and Karl
were the robbers?

1361
01:24:54,970 --> 01:24:57,029
Yeah, for now.

1362
01:24:57,072 --> 01:24:59,302
By the time they
figure it out,

1363
01:24:59,341 --> 01:25:01,104
you'll be long gone.

1364
01:25:01,143 --> 01:25:02,735
l need to see
the doctor.

1365
01:25:02,778 --> 01:25:05,246
Car's this way.

1366
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:07,714
How's Miriam doing?

1367
01:25:07,749 --> 01:25:10,479
Everyone's fine.

1368
01:25:10,519 --> 01:25:13,113
So what are you going
to do with your cut?

1369
01:25:13,155 --> 01:25:16,283
Uh, we're going to go
to get Gabrielle back.

1370
01:25:16,324 --> 01:25:18,315
With all of it?

1371
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:21,022
Actually, we need
to talk about that.

1372
01:25:22,330 --> 01:25:23,888
What?

1373
01:25:31,873 --> 01:25:33,500
Hey, you guys ready?

1374
01:25:33,542 --> 01:25:35,806
Yeah, we'll have
two breakfast tacos,

1375
01:25:35,844 --> 01:25:37,675
and coffee.

1376
01:25:37,712 --> 01:25:40,647
l'll have the same thing,
and a side of sausage.

1377
01:25:44,119 --> 01:25:46,610
Okay, thanks.

1378
01:25:46,655 --> 01:25:49,852
Hey. Looks like business
is starting to pick back up.

1379
01:25:49,891 --> 01:25:51,358
Yeah.

1380
01:25:51,393 --> 01:25:52,951
How's Miriam?

1381
01:25:52,994 --> 01:25:54,928
You know, she's good.
She'll be back next week.

1382
01:25:54,963 --> 01:25:57,363
Good good.
l need you to sign for these.

1383
01:26:06,708 --> 01:26:08,073
Thanks.

1384
01:26:08,109 --> 01:26:10,202
Yeah, have
a good day.

1385
01:26:25,026 --> 01:26:27,426
After that day,
it got me thinking.

1386
01:26:27,462 --> 01:26:31,660
Someone once told me that the road
to hell is paved with good intentions.

1387
01:26:31,700 --> 01:26:35,864
Shit, l think hell is paved
with all my bad choices.

1388
01:26:35,904 --> 01:26:38,964
Some bad guys went down
along the way,

1389
01:26:39,007 --> 01:26:41,805
and some good people
died because of it.

1390
01:26:41,843 --> 01:26:44,175
That's my hell.

1391
01:26:44,212 --> 01:26:47,079
l think l'm gonna try
something different now.

1392
01:26:47,115 --> 01:26:50,107
Maybe it's not about
choices or intentions.

1393
01:26:50,151 --> 01:26:53,211
Maybe if l just change
the life l lead,

1394
01:26:53,255 --> 01:26:56,224
l can tear that road
to hell apart.

1395
01:26:56,258 --> 01:26:58,749
And maybe,
just maybe,

1396
01:26:58,793 --> 01:27:01,557
l can help someone else
out along the way.
