00:00:49,214 --> 00:00:55,009
I want you to listen to me.
I want you to go out of the house
and down the street to the MacKenzies' house.

2
00:00:55,134 --> 00:00:56,718
I want you to knock on their door.

3
00:00:56,843 --> 00:00:59,969
I want you to tell them to call the police
and send'em over here.

4
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:01,344
All right?

5
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:03,261
Laurie. - Do as I say.
- Yeah.

6
00:01:05,429 --> 00:01:06,305
Go.

7
00:01:28,731 --> 00:01:29,647
Get help!

8
00:01:29,773 --> 00:01:30,815
Come on!

9
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:32,273
Come on!

10
00:02:02,287 --> 00:02:03,661
Oh, no.

11
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,666
Help!

12
00:02:46,804 --> 00:02:48,638
It was the boogeyman.

13
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:55,558
As a matter of fact ...

14
00:02:55,684 --> 00:02:56,975
it was.

15
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:54,373
What's going on out here?

16
00:03:54,498 --> 00:03:55,499
Call the police!

17
00:03:55,624 --> 00:03:57,250
Tell the sheriff I shot him!

18
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:57,874
Who?

19
00:03:58,001 --> 00:04:01,459
Tell him he's still on the loose!
- Is this some kind of joke?

20
00:04:01,584 --> 00:04:04,044
I've been trick-or-treated to death tonight!

21
00:04:04,586 --> 00:04:06,378
You don't know what death is!

22
00:07:36,714 --> 00:07:38,423
Trick or treat.

23
00:08:01,975 --> 00:08:04,017
I shot him six times!

24
00:08:04,142 --> 00:08:07,143
What?
- I shot him six times!

25
00:08:07,269 --> 00:08:09,228
I ... I shot him in the heart and ...

26
00:08:09,353 --> 00:08:13,021
He cannot get a very far, come on.
- I shot him six times!

27
00:08:13,272 --> 00:08:14,397
This guy ...

28
00:08:15,605 --> 00:08:17,231
he's not human!

29
00:08:40,532 --> 00:08:43,074
Harold, you want mayonnaise on your sandwich?

30
00:08:49,078 --> 00:08:50,412
How about mustard?

31
00:08:51,453 --> 00:08:57,665
{y:i}Up next some more spine melting madness
{y:i}"Night of the Living Dead"
- Are you asleep again?

32
00:09:08,377 --> 00:09:11,087

33
00:09:11,379 --> 00:09:17,173
{y:i}Police in Haddonfield have just made the grisly discovery
{y:i}of three bodies in the upstairs bedrooms of this house.

{y:i}who escaped last night from the Smith's Grow
{y:i}Warren county sanitorium.

38
00:09:33,221 --> 00:09:35,929
{y:i}He is now believed to be at large in Haddonfield.

39
00:09:36,054 --> 00:09:37,974
{y:i}This is Robert Mundy ... live.

40
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:47,810
{y:i}They're coming to get you Barbara.

41
00:09:47,935 --> 00:09:51,520

42
00:09:52,021 --> 00:09:54,688
{y:i}Stop it. You're acting like a child.

43
00:09:54,855 --> 00:09:56,314
{y:i}They're coming for you.

44
00:09:56,856 --> 00:09:57,231
{y:i}Look ...

45
00:09:57,356 --> 00:09:59,190
{y:i}There comes one of them now.

46
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,524
{y:i}She'll hear you.
{y:i}Here he comes now.

47
00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:03,233
{y:i}I'm gettitng out of here.

48
00:10:24,617 --> 00:10:26,242
Mrs. Elrod?!

49
00:10:27,451 --> 00:10:29,078
Mr. Elrod?

50
00:10:31,329 --> 00:10:32,954
Are you ok?

51
00:10:46,084 --> 00:10:47,126
Hi.

52
00:10:47,543 --> 00:10:49,960
There was someone screaming next door.

53
00:10:50,294 --> 00:10:52,587
Yeah, Mr. a Mrs. Elrod.

54
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:55,130
His wife's always picking on him.

55
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:58,464
He probably got angry and decided to start beating her.

56
00:11:00,924 --> 00:11:02,715
Ok, deal.

57
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,258
{y:i}Are your folks home?

58
00:11:04,509 --> 00:11:06,300
They are gone.

59
00:11:06,425 --> 00:11:11,303
My dad had to take my Aunt Ruby to Harden County
and my mother's decided to go along.

60
00:11:11,428 --> 00:11:12,720
{y:i}Didn't you hear?

61
00:11:13,012 --> 00:11:14,137

{y:i}Some girl got killed in Haddonfield.

63
00:11:16,555 --> 00:11:18,138
{y:i}It's on the radio.

64
00:11:18,722 --> 00:11:19,680
Hold on.

65
00:11:21,766 --> 00:11:24,351
{y:i}... and the police have curtain off the entire area

66
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:25,184

{y:i}in the house in the Northwest section of Haddonfield.

68

{y:i}The names of the teenagers have not been released ...
- I can't believe it.

69
00:11:33,144 --> 00:11:33,979
{y:i}I know.

70
00:11:34,104 --> 00:11:36,272
{y:i}You know we probably knew her.
- Where did it happen?

71
00:11:36,398 --> 00:11:37,897
{y:i}Down on Orange Grove.

72
00:11:38,856 --> 00:11:41,398
That's right down the street.
{y:i}- I know.

73
00:11:41,523 --> 00:11:45,983
{y:i}Police confirmed the girl was rescued that she ...
- Sally, I can hear the sirens coming.

74
00:11:46,191 --> 00:11:47,652
{y:i}They said the guy got away.

75
00:11:48,152 --> 00:11:49,694
Do they know who it was?
{y:i}- No.

76
00:11:51,152 --> 00:11:52,654
Oh, god.

77
00:11:53,736 --> 00:11:54,904
{y:i}Alice?

78
00:11:55,363 --> 00:11:56,279
{y:i}Alice ...

79
00:11:57,613 --> 00:11:58,488
{y:i}Talk ...

80
00:11:58,613 --> 00:11:59,907

- Where are you?
{y:i}... the main streets in town.

83
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:11,577
Who is it?
{y:i}Chief to the Haddonfield police department says.
{y:i}He believe that suspect will be apprehended ...

84
00:12:11,703 --> 00:12:13,245
{y:i}within a matter of hours.

85
00:12:13,453 --> 00:12:19,373
{y:i}Neighboor say they heard scream during the early evening,
{y:i}but activity a noise it's for usual haloween.

86
00:12:41,965 --> 00:12:44,425
I came out on the lawn.
I asked him what was going on.

87
00:12:44,549 --> 00:12:46,217
He said ...
- Inside you guys.

88
00:12:46,342 --> 00:12:48,135
He said he'd shot somebody.

89
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:19,982
All right folks. Give'em a room, please?

90
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,159
Laurie?

91
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:49,617
Can you hear me?
- Don't let them put me to sleep.

92
00:13:49,743 --> 00:13:53,994
It's all right, take it easy. We're gonna go to clinic, all right?
- Don't let them put me to sleep. - It's ok.

93
00:14:03,082 --> 00:14:03,831
Hey ...

94
00:14:03,956 --> 00:14:04,665
you know this chick?

95
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:08,208
Yeh, her name's Laurie Strode.

96
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:10,127
She goes to school with my little brother Ziggy.

97
00:14:10,252 --> 00:14:12,961
Her old man ... eh Strode Realty?
- Yeah.

98
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:14,170
Ook.

99
00:14:32,468 --> 00:14:34,386
Ok, just get out easy.

100
00:14:34,803 --> 00:14:35,677
It's gonna be ok.

101
00:14:35,803 --> 00:14:37,763
Just walk real slow, ok?

102
00:14:38,347 --> 00:14:40,805
Are you all right?
Are you all right, hon?

103
00:14:43,098 --> 00:14:44,432
Oh, god.

104
00:14:45,098 --> 00:14:50,352
Here. Just ... just put it up there real gently.
You ok? Let's go. Just walk real slow. Come on.

105
00:15:49,251 --> 00:15:53,126
Fill out this form. Someone will be with you in a moment.
- Well, we should see the doctor right away.

106
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:55,878
He's with a patient. Would you please wait in room "A"?

107
00:15:56,295 --> 00:15:57,921
Come on honey. Thank you.

108
00:16:00,755 --> 00:16:01,755
Where's Doc. Mixter?

109
00:16:02,005 --> 00:16:03,798
He's been at the country club. I think he's drunk.

110
00:16:03,923 --> 00:16:05,131
Oh, great.

111
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:06,299
What've we got?

112
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:13,094
Stub wound, left anterior chest, possibly penetrating.
Multiple ... - It's Laurie Strode. Come on, let's go.
... fractured right ankle.

113
00:16:13,969 --> 00:16:15,427
Janet, get me some more coffee.

114
00:16:15,553 --> 00:16:17,053
Get that out of here.

115
00:16:20,097 --> 00:16:21,389
Oh, Laurie.

116
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:22,973
Hi there.

117
00:16:23,514 --> 00:16:26,224
Well let's see what we have here.

118
00:16:26,349 --> 00:16:27,641
Ah yes ...

119
00:16:28,016 --> 00:16:29,725
you lost a lot of blood.

120
00:16:30,641 --> 00:16:32,142
We'll need to a type it.

121
00:16:36,186 --> 00:16:39,229
When was the last time you had a tetatus shot?

122
00:16:39,688 --> 00:16:40,980
I don't know.

123
00:16:47,233 --> 00:16:48,358
Get me some ...

124
00:16:48,483 --> 00:16:50,984
3.0 nylon on ...
- Cutting needle?

125
00:16:51,109 --> 00:16:52,151
- Yes.
- Right away.

126
00:16:52,276 --> 00:16:54,318
We're going to have to put her out.
- No!

127
00:16:54,734 --> 00:16:57,069
No, don't put me to sleep.
- Ok, relax.

128
00:16:57,194 --> 00:16:58,528
Nylon's not gonna hurt you.

129
00:16:58,653 --> 00:16:59,779
No.

130
00:17:01,865 --> 00:17:03,865
Please don't put me to sleep.

131
00:17:06,365 --> 00:17:07,532
Take it easy.

132
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:13,993
Try to relax, Laurie.

133
00:17:16,328 --> 00:17:18,704
Doctor Mixter have you stitched up in no time.

134
00:17:19,328 --> 00:17:20,955
Take it easy, Laurie.

135
00:17:23,289 --> 00:17:25,124
Circle the block again.

136
00:17:26,665 --> 00:17:27,833
How long now?

137
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:29,958
It's about 30 minutes. Put light down there.

138
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:31,709
There, by those trees.

139
00:17:32,168 --> 00:17:33,750
There is nothing.

140
00:17:33,876 --> 00:17:35,460
Well, keep going.

141
00:17:36,085 --> 00:17:38,461
You know Doctor, I'm just about there.

142
00:17:38,587 --> 00:17:39,421
What?

143
00:17:39,671 --> 00:17:42,380
The point where I stop taking orders from you.

144
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,548
Alright sheriff whatever you want.

145
00:17:45,672 --> 00:17:48,174
The primary concern is that we stop him.

146
00:17:48,632 --> 00:17:49,924
You let him out.

147
00:17:50,049 --> 00:17:52,676
I didn't.
- His own goddamn doctor.

148
00:17:52,801 --> 00:17:54,677
I didn't let him out.

149
00:17:54,926 --> 00:17:56,636
{y:i}Hey Brackett come in please...

150
00:17:57,053 --> 00:17:58,761
{y:i}Hey Brackett come in please ...

151
00:17:58,928 --> 00:17:59,679

152
00:17:59,803 --> 00:18:01,430
{y:i}Geez, this is amsey.

153
00:18:01,596 --> 00:18:02,846

154
00:18:02,971 --> 00:18:04,014
{y:i}This is Ramsey.

155
00:18:04,681 --> 00:18:05,431
Where are you?

156
00:18:05,556 --> 00:18:10,141
{y:i}I'm out by the bakery moving north on the Scottsville road.
- Get the hell back in the town.

157
00:18:10,266 --> 00:18:13,101
Go up 17th street, meet me by the bypass.

158
00:18:13,226 --> 00:18:15,018
{y:i}10 - 4 Ramsey clear.

159
00:18:15,685 --> 00:18:17,519
Will you put that thing away!

160
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:21,812
You couldn't have shot him six times!

161
00:18:22,146 --> 00:18:25,064
You think I'm lying, sherif.
- I think you missed him.

162
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:28,566
No man could take six shots.
- I've told you this isn't a man.

163
00:18:29,815 --> 00:18:33,359
Look out! Slow down!
- Why? - Over there! Look, look, look!

164
00:18:36,569 --> 00:18:37,360
Is that him?

165
00:18:37,486 --> 00:18:38,694
I don't know.

166
00:18:41,195 --> 00:18:41,778
Get back!

167
00:18:41,904 --> 00:18:43,530
Run! Come on, run!

168
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:44,573
Loomis!

169
00:18:44,782 --> 00:18:45,697
Get back!

170
00:18:46,406 --> 00:18:48,574
Get back you kids!
- Loomis!

171
00:18:48,699 --> 00:18:50,449
Stop! ... Get out!
- Loomis!

172
00:18:51,325 --> 00:18:52,034
Loomis!

173
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:53,158
Stop!

174
00:18:55,493 --> 00:18:56,578
Stop!

175
00:18:57,161 --> 00:18:58,077
Don't shoot!

176
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:00,788
Stop!
- Don't kill him!

177
00:19:12,667 --> 00:19:14,251
Oh, sheriff Brackett.

178
00:19:16,336 --> 00:19:17,585
He came out of nowhere.

179
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:19,086
I couldn't stop.

180
00:19:19,253 --> 00:19:20,212
Is it him?!

181
00:19:25,255 --> 00:19:27,048
Is it him or not!?

182
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,093
Leigh ...

183
00:19:36,511 --> 00:19:38,677
We've been found three bodies.
- Where?

184
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:40,970
Across the street from the Doyle house.

185
00:19:41,095 --> 00:19:42,554
Three kids ...

186
00:19:43,305 --> 00:19:45,055
Leigh...
one of them was Annie!

187
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,222
What?

188
00:19:57,102 --> 00:19:58,602
Does it hurt a lot?

189
00:19:59,853 --> 00:20:00,685
What?

190
00:20:02,063 --> 00:20:06,481
Oh sweetie, I can't understand you. Look, it'll be ok.
We'll play some games tonight and ...

191
00:20:06,689 --> 00:20:08,815
{y:i}Repeating for those of you who just tuned in.

192
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,816
{y:i}Three people are dead tonight ...

193
00:20:10,941 --> 00:20:14,150
{y:i}as a resolve an attack by an escaped mental patient.

194
00:20:14,402 --> 00:20:16,944
{y:i}I understand we're going to stay on the air now?

195
00:20:17,069 --> 00:20:19,529
{y:i}Repeating for those of you who just tuned in.

196
00:20:19,736 --> 00:20:21,529
{y:i}Three people are dead tonight ...

197
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:24,862
{y:i}as a resolve an attack by an escaped mental patient.

198
00:20:25,238 --> 00:20:28,949
{y:i}Any further details will be report coming
{y:i}as soon as we get them.

199
00:20:29,573 --> 00:20:30,991
{y:i}This is Robert Munday ...

200
00:20:31,117 --> 00:20:32,741
{y:i}reporting you live.

201
00:21:04,546 --> 00:21:05,629
Hi ...

202
00:21:06,464 --> 00:21:07,797
Hi.

203
00:21:09,716 --> 00:21:10,590
Jimmy ...

204
00:21:12,924 --> 00:21:14,092
Oh, how are you feeling?

205
00:21:15,259 --> 00:21:16,592
Sore.

206
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,010
What happened?

207
00:21:20,136 --> 00:21:21,345
Cracked the bone.

208
00:21:22,012 --> 00:21:23,263
Lucky it wasn't a break.

209
00:21:23,388 --> 00:21:27,347
Doctor Mixter felt that he should wait untill tomorrow,
before he put cast on.

210
00:21:27,805 --> 00:21:29,056
You have to get some rest.

211
00:21:31,016 --> 00:21:32,140
Come on, Jimmy.

212
00:21:41,186 --> 00:21:43,437
Can I get you something to drink or anything?

213
00:21:44,562 --> 00:21:45,731
How about a coke?

214
00:21:46,273 --> 00:21:47,355
Ok.

215
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:49,064
Thanks.

216
00:21:49,398 --> 00:21:50,274
Ok.

217
00:21:50,524 --> 00:21:50,899
Come on!

218
00:21:51,025 --> 00:21:53,566
Jimmy, we've got to roll. Another call came in.
- Ok.

219
00:21:54,233 --> 00:21:55,275
I'll get you that coke later.

220
00:21:56,108 --> 00:21:57,026
Out.

221
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:04,029
Moments ago police reported that Michael Myers,
formerly of Haddonfield,

222
00:22:04,154 --> 00:22:09,197
who fled the Smith's Grove Warren county Sanitarium
last night was believed to have burned to death.

223
00:22:09,364 --> 00:22:13,783
Meanwhile, three bodies were discovered
in the upstairs bedroom of the house directly behind me.

224
00:22:13,908 --> 00:22:17,452
Identification of the victims is being witheld.
Pending notification of their families ...

225
00:22:17,577 --> 00:22:20,243
Forget that. forget that.
I wanna concentrate on that house.

226
00:22:20,368 --> 00:22:23,161
Talk to some kids. See if anybody saw anything.

227
00:22:23,328 --> 00:22:28,414
You need the parent's permission to use a statement.
If you can't find the parents, get a statement anyway.

228
00:22:30,582 --> 00:22:31,707
Not now ...

229
00:22:37,877 --> 00:22:39,085
Give us a minute, fellas.

230
00:23:10,098 --> 00:23:11,056
I .. uh

231
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:17,894
have to ... go and tell my wife,
before somebody else does.

232
00:23:19,977 --> 00:23:21,645
Go on home, Leigh.

233
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:24,145
Go on home, I'll take care of everything.

234
00:23:24,437 --> 00:23:30,023
Damn you! - I'm sorrry. -What have you done?
- I haven't done anything. - YOU LET HIM OUT!

235
00:23:30,148 --> 00:23:33,566
I didn't let him out.
I gave orders for him to be restrained.

236
00:23:34,608 --> 00:23:37,400
Now is there anything else, that we can do for you?

237
00:23:37,651 --> 00:23:41,569
If that wasn't Michael Myers burning up in that car ...

238
00:23:41,694 --> 00:23:45,237
then lot of other kids are gonna be slaugtered tonight.
- He's dead.

239
00:23:45,363 --> 00:23:47,488
I saw him.
- You saw man at the mask.

240
00:23:47,613 --> 00:23:52,949
It was him. - I wanna believe you,
but I gotta be sure.
I can't stop, untill I'm certain it's dead.

241
00:23:53,115 --> 00:23:59,117
You talk about him like he's some kind of animal.
- He was my ... - Would you keep it back?!
He was my patient for fifteen years ...

242
00:23:59,242 --> 00:24:05,079
He became an obsession with me, until I realized,
that there was nothing within.
Neither consciance nor reason that was ...

243
00:24:05,204 --> 00:24:07,663
even remotely human.

244
00:24:07,788 --> 00:24:13,124
An hour ago I stood up and fired six shots into him
and he just got up and walked away.

245
00:24:13,249 --> 00:24:17,876
I am talking about the real possibility,
that he is STILL OUT THERE!

246
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:20,543
Where'd they take the body?

247
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:22,086
The Coroner's office.

248
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:24,796
Get a dentist to meet me there in half an hour.

249
00:24:36,008 --> 00:24:41,302
{y:i}Despite the fact that the man, who rescued Laurie Strode,
{y:i}claims to have shot him six times at close range.

250
00:24:41,427 --> 00:24:44,844
{y:i}Haddonfield police have no explanation
{y:i}for the suspect's disappearance ...

251
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:49,930
{y:i}But say they're confident, he will be captured soon.
- I cannot believe it.
{y:i}Paramedics are now removing the last of the bodies.

252
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:53,932
Pin the tail on the donkey and bobbing for apples.
Actually bobbing for water. No less.

253
00:24:54,057 --> 00:25:00,393
Well you gotta use water to see if you don't ...
- I am never going to another halloween party
as long as I live. Especially not at Stevie Mather's house.

254
00:25:00,518 --> 00:25:02,102
And of course now I'm gonna be late.

255
00:25:02,227 --> 00:25:04,103
Oh, you gotta drive me home first.

256
00:25:04,311 --> 00:25:06,895
Oh Darcy, I don't have time.
- You've got to.

257
00:25:08,188 --> 00:25:10,063
Oh, can't you ask Eddie Lee?

258
00:25:10,272 --> 00:25:11,981
He's in Russelville.

259
00:25:12,856 --> 00:25:17,608
It's five minutes to your house another five minutes
back to the hospital. Mrs. Alves's gonna kill me.

260
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,110
You promised me.

261
00:25:22,652 --> 00:25:24,486
I know I did.

262
00:25:47,787 --> 00:25:49,371
{y:i}One survivor ...

263
00:25:49,496 --> 00:25:54,915
{y:i}17- year  old Laurie Strode was found directly across
{y:i}the street from the home, where the murders took place.

264
00:25:55,040 --> 00:26:00,376
{y:i}The teenager was taken across town to
{y:i}Haddonfield Memorial Clinic. Paramedics on the scene ...

265
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:27,162
{y:i}In of aftermath of the killings the streets between
{y:i}Chestnut and tenth third jamed with people and ... cars.

266
00:27:27,954 --> 00:27:28,786
{y:i}Repeating ...

267
00:27:28,912 --> 00:27:33,997
{y:i}that a ... These streets a Chestnut and tenth
{y:i}there are just jamed with both people ...

268
00:27:34,122 --> 00:27:36,372
Well, I sure could go for a pizza now.

269
00:27:37,249 --> 00:27:40,542
Nice be with sausage, onions, peppers ...

270
00:27:41,834 --> 00:27:43,627
But no mushrooms. I hate mushrooms.

271
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:49,462
{y:i}The names of young victims are not yet released,
{y:i}but people would probably recognized,
{y:i}that is neighbourhood teenagers.

272
00:27:49,587 --> 00:27:51,839
Looks like a goddamn homecoming.

273
00:27:56,173 --> 00:27:56,965
{y:i}Now ...

274
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:57,882
{y:i}back ...

275
00:27:58,007 --> 00:27:59,634
{y:i}to Dementia ...

276
00:28:29,437 --> 00:28:30,814
Thanks, Mr. Garret.

277
00:28:37,315 --> 00:28:39,066
Julie saw him you know.

278
00:28:40,441 --> 00:28:41,274
Who?

279
00:28:41,691 --> 00:28:43,360
Michael Myers.

280
00:28:43,484 --> 00:28:44,652
Come on.

281
00:28:44,819 --> 00:28:46,903
I swear. Yesterday, when she was coming to work.

282
00:28:47,195 --> 00:28:48,528
Where did she see him?

283
00:28:49,612 --> 00:28:51,654
Near the shop and bag out by the mall.

284
00:28:52,404 --> 00:28:53,863
Well, she stopped at the light ...

285
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:57,324
and saw him walk in that field
behind the Lost River Dive in.

286
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:02,159
Julie said he was so creepy.
- Julie's full of shit.

287
00:29:02,451 --> 00:29:04,368
He didn't escape until last night.

288
00:29:06,869 --> 00:29:08,412
Well you don't have to swear, Budd.

289
00:29:08,537 --> 00:29:10,704
She's a goddamn moron anyway.

290
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:14,081
Every other word you say is either hell or shit or damn.

291
00:29:15,288 --> 00:29:16,373
I'm sorry.

292
00:29:16,998 --> 00:29:18,999
I guess I just fuck up all the time.

293
00:29:31,421 --> 00:29:32,254
Hi.

294
00:29:35,423 --> 00:29:36,257
Hey, you're here.

295
00:29:36,381 --> 00:29:36,965
Hi.

296
00:29:37,173 --> 00:29:37,924
You're late.

297
00:29:38,049 --> 00:29:40,591
Yea I know, I've got to get on the ward.

298
00:29:41,299 --> 00:29:42,050
Hi. Jimmy.

299
00:29:42,883 --> 00:29:44,050
Oh, hi. Karen.

300
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:50,221
Come on.

301
00:29:51,178 --> 00:29:52,388
See you later.

302
00:29:52,596 --> 00:29:53,346
Great.

303
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,849
* Amazing grace ... *

304
00:30:00,225 --> 00:30:02,726
* come sit on my face *

305
00:30:03,767 --> 00:30:05,560
* Don't make me cry ... *

306
00:30:05,685 --> 00:30:07,561
* I need your pie *

307
00:30:07,686 --> 00:30:09,645
Look, why don't you just shut up, all right?

308
00:30:10,395 --> 00:30:11,729
What do you all worked up about?

309
00:30:11,854 --> 00:30:13,063
Look it could be Ziggy, you know?

310
00:30:13,188 --> 00:30:15,564
It could've been your brother Mark,
we pulled out of there.

311
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:17,481
All right, so what do you want me to do?

312
00:30:18,482 --> 00:30:19,149
Look Jimmy ...

313
00:30:19,274 --> 00:30:22,067
Rule number one: never get involved with a patient.

314
00:30:22,691 --> 00:30:23,608
Nurses ...

315
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,359
that's another story.

316
00:30:25,484 --> 00:30:28,111
But patients is no good. It never works out.

317
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:31,320
Where you going college boy?

318
00:30:31,696 --> 00:30:33,739
I'm telling you, listen to old Budd.

319
00:31:43,933 --> 00:31:45,643
You were late again tonight.

320
00:31:47,977 --> 00:31:49,478
Just fifteen minutes.

321
00:31:49,603 --> 00:31:52,854
That could be the difference
between life and death for one of those kids.

322
00:31:54,395 --> 00:31:57,648
You're right. I'm sorry Mrs. Alves.
- I don't wanna hear any excuses.

323
00:31:57,898 --> 00:31:59,523
You're a good nurse Karen.

324
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:00,524
I'd hate to loose you.

325
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:02,483
But you've got to learn to be on time.

326
00:32:02,733 --> 00:32:04,192
Now. Let's get over this list.

327
00:32:04,567 --> 00:32:07,234
I'll be fine, really. I'm sorry. I promise.
- Ok..

328
00:32:09,319 --> 00:32:09,818
Carr ...

329
00:32:09,943 --> 00:32:12,112
Mrs. Carr, 9:30 tommorow morning.

330
00:32:12,237 --> 00:32:13,279
God, they should have ...

331
00:32:13,404 --> 00:32:15,405
They should have handled him more carefully.

332
00:32:16,489 --> 00:32:17,323
Who?

333
00:32:18,947 --> 00:32:20,323
Michael Myers.

334
00:32:22,532 --> 00:32:23,950
Michael Myers?

335
00:32:25,408 --> 00:32:25,992
Yea, he ...

336
00:32:26,117 --> 00:32:27,452
He was that guy, that was after you.

337
00:32:31,411 --> 00:32:33,037
You mean the Myers house?

338
00:32:36,414 --> 00:32:39,207
That little kid who killed his sister?
- Yea.

339
00:32:42,916 --> 00:32:44,750
But he's in a hospital somewhere.

340
00:32:44,875 --> 00:32:46,668
He escaped last night.

341
00:32:46,959 --> 00:32:48,043
How do you know?

342
00:32:48,627 --> 00:32:50,086
It's all over the radio.

343
00:32:50,211 --> 00:32:52,379
Television too. It's on right now.

344
00:32:58,339 --> 00:32:59,589
Why me?

345
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:03,758
I mean, why me?

346
00:33:06,425 --> 00:33:07,885
Times up Jimmy.

347
00:33:08,718 --> 00:33:09,885
Let's go.

348
00:33:10,052 --> 00:33:11,052
OK. ok.

349
00:33:16,222 --> 00:33:17,555
No you won't!

350
00:33:17,681 --> 00:33:19,765
Visiting hours are definitely over.

351
00:33:23,557 --> 00:33:26,350
Men ... you can't live with'em,
you can't live without'em.

352
00:33:27,184 --> 00:33:28,893
How's that shoulder feel?

353
00:33:29,852 --> 00:33:30,936
A little better.

354
00:33:31,186 --> 00:33:32,187
Good.

355
00:33:32,769 --> 00:33:34,980
We've been trying to get ahold of your parents.

356
00:33:35,771 --> 00:33:40,189
Dr. Mixter told me, they were at the same party he was,
but they're not there now and they're not at home.

357
00:33:40,523 --> 00:33:42,565
Do you have any idea of where else they might be?

358
00:33:44,025 --> 00:33:44,899
No.

359
00:33:46,109 --> 00:33:47,651
I'll just keep trying.

360
00:33:58,406 --> 00:33:59,489
Oh, this is just ...

361
00:34:01,156 --> 00:34:02,240
Janet?

362
00:34:05,575 --> 00:34:06,741
Yes Mrs. Alves.

363
00:34:06,866 --> 00:34:09,118
Go tell Mr. Garrett, we're having trouble with the phones.

364
00:34:09,243 --> 00:34:10,452
Right now.

365
00:34:11,078 --> 00:34:13,245
He's at the other end of the hall.
- Janet.

366
00:34:14,328 --> 00:34:15,830
Yes, Mrs. Alves.

367
00:34:18,746 --> 00:34:20,330
What's wrong with the phones?

368
00:34:22,332 --> 00:34:24,207
Nothing for you to worry about.

369
00:34:24,833 --> 00:34:26,584
Just get some rest right now.

370
00:34:26,875 --> 00:34:29,418
I'll let you know as soon as we get ahold of your parents.

371
00:34:58,388 --> 00:34:59,889
I'm gonna go check the phone.

372
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:02,599
You wait here and I'll call you.
- I have to get back on the floor!

373
00:35:02,724 --> 00:35:06,601
It'll take me five minutes.
- But I don't even know, how to use this thing!

374
00:38:06,257 --> 00:38:10,299
I think somebody broke into the store room.
{y:i}The lock was off.

375
00:38:14,802 --> 00:38:16,053
Mr. Garrett?

376
00:38:17,012 --> 00:38:18,554
I can't hear you.

377
00:38:20,471 --> 00:38:23,889
One of you had better drive down
to the sherif's station right away.

378
00:38:29,767 --> 00:38:32,184
Mr. Garrett, how do you work this thing?

379
00:38:32,309 --> 00:38:33,352
Janet!

380
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,739
Mr. Garrett.

381
00:40:02,096 --> 00:40:03,346
Mr. Garrett?

382
00:40:06,806 --> 00:40:09,807
Mr. Garrett ... I gotta get back on the floor.

383
00:40:13,184 --> 00:40:14,226
Hello?

384
00:40:30,441 --> 00:40:31,776
It's difficult.

385
00:40:31,984 --> 00:40:34,193
Even the gums are charred but ...

386
00:40:34,484 --> 00:40:35,526
... look here.

387
00:40:37,276 --> 00:40:38,362
See here?

388
00:40:38,779 --> 00:40:40,154
No fillings.

389
00:40:40,404 --> 00:40:43,697
He's young. Maybe seventeen, maybe eighteen.

390
00:40:43,989 --> 00:40:45,739
Michael Myers is 21.

391
00:40:46,365 --> 00:40:49,365
Positive ID means we check x-rays and dental records.

392
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:50,909
That'll take hours!

393
00:40:51,034 --> 00:40:54,368
No other way to know for sure. I'm sorry.
- We haven't got hours.

394
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:58,078
Listen to me. We've got to assume,
that Michael Myers is still alive.

395
00:41:02,829 --> 00:41:04,289
Everybody goes back out.

396
00:41:04,413 --> 00:41:05,581
But we just closed it up.

397
00:41:05,706 --> 00:41:08,831
I want to sweep from Chestnut South to the bypass.

398
00:41:08,956 --> 00:41:10,041
I want every street ...

399
00:41:10,166 --> 00:41:11,416
every house ...

400
00:41:12,084 --> 00:41:13,750
every backyard.

401
00:41:14,334 --> 00:41:15,377
Ok.

402
00:41:15,709 --> 00:41:16,919
You've got it.

403
00:41:21,754 --> 00:41:22,671
Thank you.

404
00:41:32,217 --> 00:41:39,011
All right, that's enough. That's enough!
Now come on, get out of here. You guys, go home.
Michael Myers not here.

405
00:41:48,264 --> 00:41:53,433
This is Hunt in another vehicle.
The old Myers house 45 Lampkin Ln. - The tribe.

406
00:41:53,976 --> 00:41:56,851
One of their number was butchered, this is a wake.

407
00:42:03,313 --> 00:42:05,689
Heightens my sense of security.

408
00:42:19,152 --> 00:42:20,944
All right. Knock it off!

409
00:42:22,071 --> 00:42:24,280
Come on folks, go home.

410
00:42:25,488 --> 00:42:26,781
Knock it off!!!

411
00:42:29,991 --> 00:42:30,865
Empty.

412
00:42:30,991 --> 00:42:33,950
Plus we've covered the whole east end of town.
There's nothing.

413
00:42:34,075 --> 00:42:35,076
Check it again.

414
00:42:35,201 --> 00:42:36,743
He just isn't here.

415
00:42:36,868 --> 00:42:38,244
CHECK IT again!

416
00:42:40,369 --> 00:42:41,203
You know.

417
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:44,496
Haddonfield was a pretty quiet town before tonight.

418
00:42:44,745 --> 00:42:45,705
The only a ...

419
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:47,788
gunshot you ever heard

420
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:50,499
were start tracking for the local highschool.

421
00:42:50,749 --> 00:42:53,917
Yet one night in 1963 Michael Myers ...

422
00:42:54,375 --> 00:42:57,751
did murder his sister
in that upstairs bedroom with a large ...

423
00:42:57,918 --> 00:42:59,294
butcher knife.

424
00:42:59,876 --> 00:43:01,045
I remember.

425
00:43:01,296 --> 00:43:04,045
On halloween.
- I was sixteen years old.

426
00:43:04,546 --> 00:43:06,714
It's his anniversary, Mr. Hunt.

427
00:43:07,922 --> 00:43:09,172
He came back.

428
00:43:09,756 --> 00:43:11,631
After fifteen years?

429
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:14,676
He waited with extraordinary patience,

430
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:17,010
There was a ...

431
00:43:17,135 --> 00:43:19,969
force inside him biding its time.

432
00:43:20,844 --> 00:43:25,096
The stuff grew accustomed to his immobility and silence.

433
00:43:25,846 --> 00:43:29,682
In many ways he was the ideal patient.
He didn't talked he didn't ...

434
00:43:30,057 --> 00:43:32,474
cry. He didn't even move.

435
00:43:32,808 --> 00:43:34,309
He just waited.

436
00:43:34,934 --> 00:43:37,476
The staff was unprepared they didn't ...

437
00:43:37,976 --> 00:43:40,060
know, what he was.

438
00:43:40,644 --> 00:43:41,895
Did you know?

439
00:43:42,854 --> 00:43:44,146
Yea I knew.

440
00:43:44,271 --> 00:43:45,271
Excuse me.

441
00:43:45,897 --> 00:43:46,814
Mr. Hunt?

442
00:43:47,688 --> 00:43:52,189
Yea. What is it Craig? - Yea. I'm worried about
Bennet Tramer. - He isn't home yet.
- Yea. And he left the party at ten.

443
00:43:52,315 --> 00:43:54,026
It's only a little after ...

444
00:43:54,151 --> 00:43:55,233
eleven boys.

445
00:43:55,358 --> 00:43:56,776
He was real drunk.

446
00:43:57,026 --> 00:43:57,985
How old is he?

447
00:43:58,110 --> 00:43:59,401
Seventeen.

448
00:43:59,526 --> 00:44:01,570
He had this stupid mask on.

449
00:44:01,986 --> 00:44:03,194
All right boys.

450
00:44:04,029 --> 00:44:04,945
Seventeen ...

451
00:44:05,070 --> 00:44:06,779
... and wearing a mask.

452
00:44:08,156 --> 00:44:11,157
Oh god.
- We should check his dental records.

453
00:44:12,741 --> 00:44:16,950
Old reservoir road. They had break-in the
elementary school. They're pretty sure it's him. - Come on!

454
00:45:14,807 --> 00:45:15,975
Oh, stop.

455
00:45:16,642 --> 00:45:18,392
Aw, shit!

456
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:21,560
Shit. - Oh, you idiot!

457
00:45:21,894 --> 00:45:23,269
You could've broken it.

458
00:45:24,061 --> 00:45:25,855
I wish I had!

459
00:45:27,813 --> 00:45:30,439
I also could have used these on you.

460
00:45:32,106 --> 00:45:33,440
What an asshole.

461
00:45:33,565 --> 00:45:34,815
Happy Halloween.

462
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:37,485
Budd ...

463
00:45:37,777 --> 00:45:39,944
you are the biggest jerk ...

464
00:45:40,069 --> 00:45:41,611
I've ever met.

465
00:45:45,196 --> 00:45:46,445
But you love me.

466
00:45:47,571 --> 00:45:48,822
Yeah ...

467
00:45:49,863 --> 00:45:51,281
I'm an idiot.

468
00:46:00,243 --> 00:46:02,785
Let's go down to the therapy room.

469
00:46:03,912 --> 00:46:06,246
Budd's finger needs a little bit of therapy.

470
00:46:07,371 --> 00:46:09,498
I can't leave the kids right now.

471
00:46:09,621 --> 00:46:11,623
Well, everybody is all weirded out tonight?

472
00:46:11,832 --> 00:46:13,790
All this Michael Myers crap.

473
00:46:15,082 --> 00:46:16,041
I just ...

474
00:46:18,584 --> 00:46:19,668
I just want ...

475
00:46:38,925 --> 00:46:40,844
The therapy room's three doors down.

476
00:46:45,428 --> 00:46:51,264
I suppose if we left the door open, we could hear if
somebody is coming ... or if the kids started to cry ...

477
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:54,974
No. I ... I got to check it out first.

478
00:46:55,641 --> 00:46:56,767
Fifteen minutes.

479
00:46:59,101 --> 00:47:00,935
If everything's ok.

480
00:47:02,102 --> 00:47:03,477
You're wasting time.

481
00:47:15,315 --> 00:47:16,899
{y:i}Why don't you tell me?

482
00:47:17,774 --> 00:47:20,067
{y:i}Why don't you ever tell me anything?

483
00:47:20,651 --> 00:47:21,943
I told you ...

484
00:47:22,694 --> 00:47:24,403
I'm NOT your mother.

485
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:00,983
It's hot.

486
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:30,579
It's hot in here.

487
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:33,664
It's just me.

488
00:49:48,337 --> 00:49:49,796
I'm not kidding.

489
00:49:51,172 --> 00:49:53,130
It's too hot in here now, Budd.

490
00:49:53,422 --> 00:49:54,714
Why don't you go check?

491
00:49:56,881 --> 00:49:58,175
It's cold out there.

492
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:01,967
It can get cold in here.

493
00:50:05,052 --> 00:50:05,968
Gotcha.

494
00:51:21,458 --> 00:51:22,916
Forget it, Budd.

495
00:51:23,166 --> 00:51:24,584
I have to go back to work.

496
00:51:31,879 --> 00:51:33,964
You wanna go for breakfast later?

497
00:51:37,548 --> 00:51:38,715
No ...

498
00:51:43,968 --> 00:51:45,135
I'm sorry.

499
00:51:47,969 --> 00:51:50,053
I just have to get back. That's all.

500
00:51:52,178 --> 00:51:54,345
Now. Budd, don't be that way.

501
00:52:33,112 --> 00:52:34,530
He got in here.

502
00:52:36,072 --> 00:52:37,365
And look over here.

503
00:52:46,367 --> 00:52:47,827
And here ...

504
00:52:56,247 --> 00:52:57,414
Sister.

505
00:52:59,497 --> 00:53:00,541
Is that it?

506
00:53:00,833 --> 00:53:01,708
No.

507
00:53:02,583 --> 00:53:03,417
Here.

508
00:53:10,502 --> 00:53:11,628
What's this?

509
00:53:12,003 --> 00:53:13,546
It's gibberish.

510
00:53:13,671 --> 00:53:14,546
No.

511
00:53:15,047 --> 00:53:16,589
It's a celtic word.

512
00:53:17,547 --> 00:53:18,590
Samhain ...

513
00:53:19,757 --> 00:53:21,715
It means the Lord of the dead.

514
00:53:22,674 --> 00:53:23,966
The end of summer.

515
00:53:25,384 --> 00:53:26,635
The festival ...

516
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:28,385
of samhain.

517
00:53:29,136 --> 00:53:30,761
October 31st.

518
00:53:32,679 --> 00:53:33,970
Dr. Loomis?

519
00:53:34,095 --> 00:53:34,971
Yes?

520
00:53:36,096 --> 00:53:38,138
I have to talk to you.

521
00:53:39,974 --> 00:53:41,641
Oh, I didn't recognize you.

522
00:53:42,849 --> 00:53:44,309
What are you doing here?

523
00:53:44,726 --> 00:53:46,017
Privately.

524
00:53:56,773 --> 00:53:57,730
Thanks.

525
00:53:59,273 --> 00:54:00,398
Dr. Loomis ...

526
00:54:00,690 --> 00:54:03,066
You've been ordered back to Smith's Grove.

527
00:54:03,483 --> 00:54:04,524
Ordered?

528
00:54:04,943 --> 00:54:07,568
He can't order me.
- No, no ...

529
00:54:07,902 --> 00:54:09,443
but the governor can.

530
00:54:09,568 --> 00:54:12,820
He spoke to Dr. Rogers personally a few hours ago.
- The Governor ...

531
00:54:13,529 --> 00:54:14,737
well, well ...

532
00:54:14,862 --> 00:54:17,780
Dr. Loomis this thing is all over the state.

533
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:23,866
Patient escapes once, murders three teenagers.
You shoot him with a gun, he escapes again.

534
00:54:23,991 --> 00:54:26,200
Someone should have listened to me earlier.

535
00:54:26,534 --> 00:54:28,327
I know. I'm sorry.

536
00:54:29,451 --> 00:54:33,411
Dr. Rogers is just afraid that this could jeapordize
our whole rehabilitation program.

537
00:54:33,537 --> 00:54:39,122
He doesn't want anyone from the mental
health department anywhere near Haddonfield.
- Why did he send you down here then?

538
00:54:40,872 --> 00:54:42,707
In case you already found him.

539
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,125
... alive.
- Tell Dr. Rogers ...

540
00:54:45,251 --> 00:54:49,252
Tell him you couldn't find me. Tell him anything.
I can't leave Haddonfield now.

541
00:54:49,669 --> 00:54:51,711
I'm afraid you don't have a choice.

542
00:54:53,086 --> 00:54:56,088
There's a marshal waiting for you outside.

543
00:55:12,678 --> 00:55:13,804
Laurie ...

544
00:55:18,597 --> 00:55:19,681
listen ...

545
00:55:21,390 --> 00:55:22,640
I know that ...

546
00:55:22,890 --> 00:55:24,641
you don't know me very well.

547
00:55:25,517 --> 00:55:27,726
But I just wanna let you to know that ...

548
00:55:29,017 --> 00:55:31,519
I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.

549
00:55:31,853 --> 00:55:32,894
Ok?

550
00:55:33,978 --> 00:55:34,770
Promise.

551
00:55:40,439 --> 00:55:41,565
Laurie.

552
00:55:49,902 --> 00:55:51,111
Shit!

553
00:56:07,534 --> 00:56:08,993
Dr. Mixter?!

554
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:13,619
Dr. Mixter.

555
00:56:18,831 --> 00:56:20,330
Dr. Mixter!

556
00:56:37,004 --> 00:56:38,672
Dr. Mixter?

557
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:44,507
Dr. Mixter ...

558
00:56:44,632 --> 00:56:46,175
It's an emergency!

559
00:56:54,596 --> 00:56:57,096
Dr. Mixter, it's Laurie Strode.

560
00:56:57,388 --> 00:56:59,306
She's had a reaction to the medication.

561
00:56:59,805 --> 00:57:01,389
You better come quick.

562
00:57:06,558 --> 00:57:07,975
Dr. Mixter.

563
00:57:49,951 --> 00:57:52,243
This is ridiculous. I'm gonna go find Mrs. Alves.

564
00:58:01,706 --> 00:58:03,122
Mrs. Alves?

565
01:00:07,757 --> 01:00:08,716
Laurie?

566
01:00:08,924 --> 01:00:10,134
You ok?

567
01:02:36,568 --> 01:02:37,819
We will find him.

568
01:02:38,527 --> 01:02:39,904
Where're you gonna look?

569
01:02:40,527 --> 01:02:41,820
I don't know.

570
01:02:43,279 --> 01:02:44,488
Neither do I.

571
01:03:14,251 --> 01:03:15,710
Mr. Garrett?

572
01:03:40,553 --> 01:03:42,638
Mr. Garrett!?

573
01:04:09,023 --> 01:04:10,566
Mr. Garrett?

574
01:04:13,108 --> 01:04:14,733
Mr. Garrett?

575
01:04:16,776 --> 01:04:17,694
Sorry.

576
01:04:18,736 --> 01:04:19,527
Listen ...

577
01:04:20,736 --> 01:04:22,362
I can't find anybody.

578
01:04:23,071 --> 01:04:24,279
Budd's gone ...
Mrs. Alves is gone.

579
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:28,573
We gotta find Laurie.

580
01:04:28,989 --> 01:04:30,074
All right, listen.

581
01:04:31,657 --> 01:04:33,658
Why don't you check the East wing again?

582
01:04:33,908 --> 01:04:34,868
All right?

583
01:04:35,284 --> 01:04:40,369
And if you don't find anyone, I want you to
get into your car and drive out to the sheriff's station.
Get somebody out of here.

584
01:04:41,703 --> 01:04:42,495
All right?

585
01:04:44,621 --> 01:04:45,497
Ok.

586
01:04:45,913 --> 01:04:46,455
Ok.

587
01:04:46,581 --> 01:04:47,747
I'll keep looking.

588
01:05:08,297 --> 01:05:09,215
Hello?

589
01:05:42,603 --> 01:05:43,728
Jesus.

590
01:08:29,171 --> 01:08:30,213
Laurie!

591
01:08:34,340 --> 01:08:35,215
Laurie.

592
01:08:35,674 --> 01:08:36,882
Laurie wait!

593
01:08:40,385 --> 01:08:41,719
Wait Laurie ...

594
01:13:23,501 --> 01:13:25,377
He didn't believe me and now they're dead.

595
01:13:26,459 --> 01:13:27,878
I'm sorry.

596
01:13:28,128 --> 01:13:29,503
Don't feel sorry for me.

597
01:13:30,044 --> 01:13:32,129
Feel sorry for that little town back there.

598
01:13:32,629 --> 01:13:34,504
It'll be years before they forget this.

599
01:13:36,673 --> 01:13:39,465
Dr. Loomis, I think there's something else
you should know.

600
01:13:40,133 --> 01:13:42,925
You see the blackboard
back there in the Elementary school?

601
01:13:43,216 --> 01:13:44,342
Yea?

602
01:13:44,968 --> 01:13:46,593
In order to appease the gods,

603
01:13:46,718 --> 01:13:50,678
the druid priests ... held ... fire ... rituals.

604
01:13:50,928 --> 01:13:53,804
Prisoners of war, criminals, the insane ...

605
01:13:53,929 --> 01:13:55,222
animals ...

606
01:13:55,471 --> 01:13:56,431
were ...

607
01:13:57,515 --> 01:13:58,848
burned alive

608
01:13:58,973 --> 01:14:00,557
in baskets.

609
01:14:01,099 --> 01:14:05,726
By observing the way they died, the druids believed,
they could see omens of the future.

610
01:14:07,518 --> 01:14:10,561
2000 years later we've come no further.

611
01:14:12,187 --> 01:14:13,604
Samhain isn't ...

612
01:14:13,729 --> 01:14:15,396
evil spirits.

613
01:14:16,523 --> 01:14:19,149
It isn't goblins, ghosts or witches.

614
01:14:20,649 --> 01:14:23,192
it's the unconscious mind.

615
01:14:24,567 --> 01:14:28,027
We're all afraid of the dark inside ourselves.

616
01:14:30,153 --> 01:14:32,446
Dr. Loomis, please listen to me.

617
01:14:32,571 --> 01:14:36,530
There's a file on Michael Myers, that nobody knew about.
- I've seen everything. - No.

618
01:14:36,655 --> 01:14:40,866
No. It was hidden.
Sealed by the court after his parents were killed.

619
01:14:41,616 --> 01:14:46,910
Now after the Governor heard what happened tonight,
he authorized Dr. Rogers to open it.

620
01:14:47,035 --> 01:14:48,327
What file?

621
01:14:49,744 --> 01:14:51,036
It isn't fair.

622
01:14:51,161 --> 01:14:53,661
They should've allowed you to examine everything.

623
01:14:55,039 --> 01:14:56,080
That girl ...

624
01:14:56,206 --> 01:14:59,832
that Strode girl, that's Michael Myers sister.

625
01:15:01,207 --> 01:15:02,458
She was born ...

626
01:15:02,583 --> 01:15:04,375
2 years before he was commited.

627
01:15:04,501 --> 01:15:08,336
Two years after ... his parents died
and she was adopted by the Strodes.

628
01:15:08,461 --> 01:15:14,630
They requested, that the records be sealed
in order to protect the family. - Jeez, don't you see,
what he's doing here in Haddonfield?

629
01:15:14,755 --> 01:15:18,005
He killed one sister fifteen years ago.
Now he's trying to kill the other!

630
01:15:19,215 --> 01:15:21,883
Tonight after I shot him, where did they take her?

631
01:15:22,341 --> 01:15:23,383
The clinic.

632
01:15:23,592 --> 01:15:25,926
Clinic where? Do you know this area well?

633
01:15:26,259 --> 01:15:27,134
A little bit.

634
01:15:27,259 --> 01:15:30,677
Where's the hospital located?
- Dr. Loomis we're under orders from the Governor!

635
01:15:30,803 --> 01:15:32,886
It's back around Seventeen about three miles.

636
01:15:33,011 --> 01:15:34,679
Turn this car around now!

637
01:15:34,805 --> 01:15:36,722
I can't do that. I've got orders.

638
01:15:36,846 --> 01:15:39,765
Those orders have changed!
- Dr. Loomis!

639
01:15:39,890 --> 01:15:42,099
Doctor, you're getting yourself into a lot of trouble.

640
01:15:42,224 --> 01:15:45,558
What is your fellows usually do?
Fire a warning shot, right?

641
01:16:20,156 --> 01:16:20,948
Jimmy?

642
01:16:30,577 --> 01:16:31,495
It's all right.

643
01:16:32,619 --> 01:16:33,662
We're ...

644
01:16:34,246 --> 01:16:36,080
Ok, we're gonna get out of here.

645
01:16:47,459 --> 01:16:48,668
I think, I think ...

646
01:17:44,524 --> 01:17:48,317
I ought to handcuff you to the wheel,
but I have a feeling I'm gonna need you in there.

647
01:17:48,443 --> 01:17:49,568
Can I trust you?

648
01:17:50,610 --> 01:17:51,901
What have I got to loose ...

649
01:17:52,027 --> 01:17:53,445
except my job?

650
01:17:55,070 --> 01:17:56,361
I need help ...

651
01:17:59,239 --> 01:18:00,406
Help ...

652
01:18:01,531 --> 01:18:03,074
Help ... me.

653
01:18:04,907 --> 01:18:07,200
HELP ME!!

654
01:18:15,619 --> 01:18:17,288
Go and check all the rooms down there.

655
01:18:17,413 --> 01:18:18,371
Go on!

656
01:18:18,496 --> 01:18:20,747
Dr. Loomis.
- You stay with me and shut up.

657
01:18:54,345 --> 01:18:55,553
HELP!

658
01:18:58,347 --> 01:18:59,262

01:19:04,098 --> 01:19:05,099

661
01:19:11,726 --> 01:19:12,852
HELP!!

662
01:19:15,687 --> 01:19:17,188
PLEASE!

663
01:19:17,396 --> 01:19:19,021
PLEASE!

664
01:19:20,564 --> 01:19:21,564
PLEASE!

665
01:19:25,149 --> 01:19:26,149
Come on, get in!

666
01:20:00,830 --> 01:20:01,747
Stop!

667
01:20:02,039 --> 01:20:02,747
He is dead!

668
01:20:02,872 --> 01:20:03,998
No, he's not. Look at him!

669
01:20:04,122 --> 01:20:05,248
He's still breathing.

670
01:20:07,541 --> 01:20:08,334
Ok.

671
01:20:10,626 --> 01:20:13,461
There's a two way radio over in the marshall's car.
I want you to go outside.

672
01:20:13,586 --> 01:20:15,503
Get on that radio and get help!

673
01:20:16,294 --> 01:20:17,545
Now wait a minute.

674
01:20:17,879 --> 01:20:20,005
I'm the only one authorized to use that.

675
01:20:20,130 --> 01:20:21,047
Move!

676
01:20:25,257 --> 01:20:26,632
I'm sorry I left you.

677
01:20:27,174 --> 01:20:28,216
Are you all right?

678
01:20:32,260 --> 01:20:33,469
Why won't he die?

679
01:20:36,345 --> 01:20:37,721
Get away from him!

680
01:20:37,845 --> 01:20:39,346
But he's stopped breathing!

681
01:20:39,471 --> 01:20:40,388
No!

682
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:48,666

01:22:28,849 --> 01:22:30,809
Take that gun. Come on!
- No.

687
01:22:30,976 --> 01:22:32,101
Take it.

688
01:22:32,934 --> 01:22:33,934
Take it!

689
01:23:26,207 --> 01:23:27,332
Michael?!

690
01:23:43,922 --> 01:23:45,172
Michael STOP!

691
01:25:16,835 --> 01:25:19,169
Get out. get out. Go on.

01:25:19,461 --> 01:25:20,878

Get out NOW!

694
01:25:31,715 --> 01:25:33,592
It's time ...
Michael.

695
01:26:52,458 --> 01:26:53,625
What's the count?

696
01:26:53,792 --> 01:26:54,708
Ten.

697
01:26:55,417 --> 01:26:56,625
So far.

698
01:27:06,421 --> 01:27:10,381
Do you have any firsthand information ...
- Just leave me alone. -
... about what happened inside the hospital? - Excuse us.

699
01:27:13,091 --> 01:27:14,091
Can't I ride in front?

700
01:27:14,216 --> 01:27:16,008
No Laurie.
I'm sorry, I have to put you in back.

701
01:27:16,133 --> 01:27:16,718
Are you ready?

702
01:27:16,843 --> 01:27:18,259
Watch out for your feet.

703
01:27:18,843 --> 01:27:21,636

- Drop your feet carefull.

704
01:27:21,762 --> 01:27:23,720
... and into the ambulance.

705
01:27:24,763 --> 01:27:26,013
Big step.

706
01:27:26,512 --> 01:27:27,388
Big step ...

707
01:27:28,513 --> 01:27:29,431
Ok.

708
01:27:30,389 --> 01:27:32,391
Keep the leg up.
We'll have you out of here in a second.

709
01:27:36,017 --> 01:27:36,893
