It's a great honor to be here today...

00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:49,806
to introduce you
to a truly great group of kids.

Sure, they can be
a little rambunctious.

They've run me ragged and played
more than their fair share of pranks.

I still haven't forgotten
about those eggs.

But more than that,
these are good people.

great teams have in common ?

446
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:24,001
- Great coaching.
- Don't try to suck up to me, Averman.

447
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:27,703
Defense.

448
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:34,138
See, unlike scoring,
defense never quits.

449
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:38,080
But to play great defense,
you need one thing above all else.

450
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:40,083
Bet it starts
with a ""W.''

451
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:42,642
Confidence.

452
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:49,823
Listen, if you learn nothing
else when you're here, you learn this.

453
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:53,159
All right ? 'Cause
it's not just about hockey.

454
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:58,169
It's easy to be confident
when you have control of the puck.

455
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:00,500
It's very, very difficult
to keep that confidence...

456
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:04,508
when you gotta take whatever
strange bounces life throws your way.

457
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:07,670
Don't be careless,
but don't be too careful either.

458
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:11,273
You cannot be afraid
to lose.

459
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:15,115
That's how you gain the confidence
to attack the game...

460
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:17,950
when the puck
isn't yours.

461
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:21,116
That's how you attack life,

462
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:25,424
even when you think
you don't have any control.

463
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:32,867
And that's how
you play real defense.

464
00:29:39,043 --> 00:29:42,638

- I like pizza.
- Music ?

481
00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:30,584
Of course I like music.
I like Pantera.

- No way ! I love Pantera.

we don't agree on is hockey.

Don't understand the rules ?

I have to admit
I've never been to a game.

[ Sighs ] You have never heard
of the Anaheim Mighty Ducks ?

487
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:53,049

- Sorry.
