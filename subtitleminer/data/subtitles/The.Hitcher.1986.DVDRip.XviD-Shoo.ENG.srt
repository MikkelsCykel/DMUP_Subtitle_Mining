<i>It's 4:15</i>
<i>on a Saturday morning...</i>

2
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,512
My mother told me never to do this.

3
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,277
Bless you.

4
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:28,233
- My name's Jim Halsey.
- John Ryder.

5
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:36,191
- Can I drop you off somewhere?
- I'm getting your car wet.

6
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:41,912
This isn't my car. It's a drive-away.
The owner lives in San Diego.

7
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,592
So where are you headed?

8
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,233
- Have you got a smoke?
- Yeah, sure.

9
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:11,477
- So tell me where you're going.
- Yeah, sure.

10
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,350
What are you looking at me
like that for?

11
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,716
I'm just looking.

12
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,238
What are you doing?

13
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,990
What did you do that for?

14
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,350
I asked you a question.

15
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,115
Did I scare you?

16
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:07,874
I think you'd better get out now.

17
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,878
The ride's over.

18
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,713
Goodbye.

19
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:41,714
I'm going to sit here,
and you're going to drive.

20
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,871
DOOR AJAR

21
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,152
Excuse me.

22
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,873
What was the matter back there?

23
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:01,238
- Why?
- I thought I saw something.

24
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,672
- I ran out of gas.
- So you need a gas station.

25
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,594
- It would help.
- Okay.

26
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,073
Gas stations have cigarettes.

27
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,678
- What about gas?
- I don't need gas.

28
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,634
What do you want?

29
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,834
- What's so funny?
- That's what the other guy said.

30
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,991
Who is the other guy?

31
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:04,678
The guy driving the car back there.
He picked me up before you did.

32
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:10,520
- Was that him in the car?
- Sure. He couldn't have walked far.

33
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,792
Why's that?

34
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,191
Because I cut off his legs...

35
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,954
And his arms...

36
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,589
And his head...

37
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,839
And I'm going to do the same to you.

38
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,190
Don't.

39
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,234
What part of Illinois are you from?

40
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:19,279
- What?
- Your license plate.

41
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,153
Tell the man.

42
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,630
- Chicago.
- My wife's from Rockford.

43
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,793
- Have you got a cigarette?
- No.

44
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,671
All right, the road's clear now.
Get going, sweethearts.

45
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,551
Drive.

46
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:17,075
Do you want to know what happens
to an eyeball when it gets punctured?

47
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,994
Do you know how much blood
jets out of a guy's neck -

48
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,913
- when his throat's been slit?

49
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,312
What do you want?

50
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,950
I want you to stop me.

51
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:42,875
You've got the knife. You'll stick me
with it before I can do anything.

52
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,192
That's right, so what
have you got to lose? Stop me.

53
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,796
Crying isn't going to help.

54
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:02,196
Keep driving.

55
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,957
Please, I'll do anything.

56
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,390
Say four words.

57
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,670
Say: "I want to die."

58
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,952
Say what?

59
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,113
"I want to die." Say it.

60
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,354
- I don't know if I can say that.
- Sure you can. Repeat after me...

61
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,114
I...

62
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,911
I...

63
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,231
Want...

64
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,150
Want...

65
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,353
To...

66
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,988
Die.

67
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,718
I don't want to die!

68
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,792
Fuck you, buddy.

69
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,236
Hey, pull over.

70
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:26,117
Pull over.
The guy in your car is a nut.

71
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:30,956
- Shoot him.
- That guy's a fucking nut.

72
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,874
- Kill him.
- That guy will kill you.

73
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,350
Get that guy out of your car.

74
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,157
Where do you think you're going?

75
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,638
See you later.

76
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:47,676
We're closed.
We don't open for another 45 minutes.

77
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,879
- I need to use the phone.
- Sorry, we're closed.

78
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:57,512
- No, I have to call the cops.
- What happened?

79
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:02,435
I can't explain right now.
I need to use the phone.

80
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:07,798
If Jack saw me doing this,
he'd kick my butt.

81
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,952
The phone is around the corner.

82
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:16,515
You stink of gasoline.
Were you in an accident?

83
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:34,992
Hello. Police? My name's Jim Halsey.
I know who killed those people...

84
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:40,109
I picked up a hitchhiker...
He blew up the gas station.

85
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,716
Jim Halsey. H-A-L-S-E-Y.

86
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,039
I'm at the Longhorn restaurant.

87
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,513
You do? Yes, sir.
I won't go anywhere.

88
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,192
Jesus...

89
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,150
The cops won't get here so quick.

90
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:12,630
A guy got shot here
a couple of months ago.

91
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:19,239
It took 45 minutes for them to get
here. By that time the guy was dead.

92
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:27,475
Specialty of the house. It's the
only thing I know how to make.

93
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:30,677
Thanks, that's real nice of you.

94
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:35,231
- Is everything going to be okay?
- I hope so.

95
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:41,270
You sure look a lot better.
I guess it's safe for me to smoke now.

96
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:53,877
I'm sorry I gave you a hard time.
A lot of trash passes through here.

97
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,316
- How is it?
- Real good. Thanks.

98
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:03,759
- My name's Nash.
- Jim Halsey.

99
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,198
I really appreciate this.

100
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,272
- Where are you from?
- Chicago.

101
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:15,557
Where are you headed?
California?

102
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:21,352
- How did you know that?
- Everyone's going. Hollywood?

103
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:26,674
- No, San Diego.
- I thought about moving.

104
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:30,116
Jeremy, who owns this place,
he's my cousin.

105
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:34,637
Uncle Jack does the cooking.
It's like that, see.

106
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:38,475
We're all kind of interrelated.

107
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:44,590
It's hard to just pick up and leave,
but you never know.

108
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,155
My brother Bill is from Mars.

109
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:53,950
Actually, we're all from Mars.
We keep our spaceship out the back.

110
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:57,476
What planet are you from?

111
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,275
- What?
- You haven't heard a word I said.

112
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:11,833
- Yes, I have.
- It's okay. Eat your burger.

113
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,992
I ought to get some stuff
out of the freezer.

114
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,671
Stand where you are!
Put your hands in the air!

115
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:09,595
- He's in there.
- Get your ass on the cement.

116
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,513
I'm not going to tell you again.

117
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,035
Put your hands behind your back.

118
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:57,031
- My wallet is in my pocket.
- Shut up! We know how to do it.

119
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,032
He put that there.

120
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:24,117
Shut up! Don't move.

121
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:31,239
What's going on?
What did you do to him?

122
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:37,114
- You keep to yourself.
- Why are you arresting him?

123
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,399
Do you know this guy?

124
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:44,678
- Not really. No.
- Then what's he doing inside?

125
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:49,868
Half the cops in the state are looking
for this creep. Get him out of here.

126
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:11,033
Where's your driver's license?
Your ID?

127
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,237
Where are your credit cards?

128
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,877
The guy I have been telling you about
took my wallet and planted the knife.

129
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:24,318
My license was in my wallet.
I don't have any credit cards.

130
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:32,991
I suppose he took
your vehicle registration, too.

131
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:41,109
That's a fancy car for such
a young kid. Did you steal it?

132
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:48,031
The car doesn't belong to me.
It's a drive-away.

133
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:53,638
I'm delivering it to California.
The guy is in San Diego.

134
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,158
What's his name?

135
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,912
I don't remember.

136
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:18,753
I know the number of the drive-away
company. Call them.

137
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:22,549
We'd better call somebody,
because you're in deep shit.

138
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,076
It's 312-399-2090.

139
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:32,236
I know their number. I was
on their waiting list for a month.

140
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:37,155
I wanted a car going to California.
That's why it took so long.

141
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,915
<i>Midwest Drive-away.</i>

142
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:45,837
<i>Our office hours are 9 to 5.</i>
<i>Closed Saturday and Sunday.</i>

143
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:51,316
Now what are we going to do?
You've got one more call.

144
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:55,359
Call my brother. He'll be home.

145
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:58,830
It's 312-905-9044.

146
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:23,476
You didn't let it ring long enough.

147
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,436
Do I look like a killer to you?

148
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:37,713
Some folks from Austin
will be here to talk to you tomorrow.

149
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,758
You'd better get some rest.

150
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,878
Get him locked up.

151
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,558
Let's go.

152
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:56,430
Jack, that kid isn't a killer,
any fool could see that.

153
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:02,272
Okay, face front. Hold real still.

154
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:07,633
Turn to your right. Steady.

155
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,233
Make a left.

156
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:17,274
Those are real good.
Your mom is going to like those.

157
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:49,311
You behave yourself now.

158
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,192
Hello?

159
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:08,552
Hello!

160
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:20,710
Come on.

161
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:25,156
- Stop!
- Take it easy.

162
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:29,431
Get over by the car.

163
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:38,200
Those cuffs on your belt,
put them on your partner.

164
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:42,194
- You mean me?
- No, you!

165
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:52,478
Okay, we're going for a little ride.
Get in the front. I'll be in the back.

166
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,592
One of you open the door.

167
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,553
Get in the car.

168
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:06,996
Okay, you and me
are going to get in together.

169
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,392
Go.

170
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:28,194
- May I close the door?
- Yes.

171
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,112
Start the car.

172
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:36,392
Head for the highway.

173
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:56,513
Can you get me in touch
with someone who's in charge?

174
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:00,514
I'll try to get through
to Capt. Esteridge.

175
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:05,071
Okay, do it...
But don't tell them where we are.

176
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:10,599
- Central...
- Don't tell them anything.

177
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:17,794
Central, we have been hijacked
by the suspect.

178
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:22,593
He wishes to speak
to Capt. Esteridge directly.

179
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:27,550
We'll try to locate Esteridge.
Stand by.

180
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:40,994
<i>This is Capt. Esteridge.</i>
<i>Do you read? Over.</i>

181
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:52,358
This is Jim Halsey. Listen,
I swear I didn't kill those people.

182
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:55,512
I got set up
by this guy I picked up hitchhiking.

183
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:00,470
<i>- What do you suggest we do?</i>
- Come on, man, you tell me.

184
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:06,237
<i>Stop this right now. Let my men go,</i>
<i>and give yourself up.</i>

185
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:10,791
I don't have any identification.
How are you going to check me out?

186
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,679
<i>Are you willing to surrender?</i>

187
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:18,470
<i>I'll do everything in my power</i>
<i>to see that you're treated fairly.</i>

188
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:26,552
I'm putting my trust in you, Captain.

189
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,955
Take us in.

190
00:46:56,600 --> 00:47:02,038
I know you caught something.
You're the best fisherman around.

191
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:07,274
But if that's the best you can eat,
I don't know what you're going to do.

192
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:11,558
- That'll tide us over.
- Then you'd better go.

193
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:16,635
- We'd better get on the road.
- Yeah, I'll see you.

194
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:21,872
- What happened to you?
- Nothing.

195
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:27,072
Nothing happened.

196
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:33,352
- I need some coffee.
- It's brewing.

197
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:39,393
- I'll sit in one of the booths.
- Are you okay, kid?

198
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:42,154
No.

199
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:19,312
How do you like shitsville?

200
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:26,393
Don't you move.

201
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:30,109
You stay seated right where you are.

202
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:33,670
Or I'll blow your brains
through your ass.

203
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,952
The gun is empty.

204
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:56,837
- You never checked it.
- I'll blow you in half.

205
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:02,558
- All right, squeeze the trigger.
- I will.

206
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:11,278
You can sure as shit bet
I'm going to squeeze mine.

207
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:33,591
Why are you doing this to me?

208
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,356
You're a smart kid.

209
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:07,239
You figure it out.

210
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:33,438
I didn't do it.
I didn't do any of it.

211
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:37,639
I'm not going to shoot anybody.
I'm not a killer.

212
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:45,556
This morning a guy tried to kill me.
He's been following me ever since.

213
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:48,917
I don't know why.

214
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:53,399
Do you believe me?

215
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:58,392
Sure. Yeah.

216
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:05,477
No, you don't. I wouldn't either.

217
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:11,158
Let's go and sit down.

218
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:41,912
What are you going to do?

219
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,516
Give up. I have no choice.

220
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:16,110
Step down.

221
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:20,872
All right, step down.

222
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:27,589
I'm turning myself in.

223
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:32,675
Step out from behind the door.
Step away from the bus. Move.

224
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:39,631
- Move your ass, now.
- I'm giving up. I'm not guilty.

225
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:49,198
You just wasted two of my friends.

226
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:56,036
You spit on my wrist.

227
00:55:56,200 --> 00:56:00,557
You spit on my wrist. Wipe it off.

228
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:08,353
- You can see I'm not armed.
- Lyle, go easy.

229
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:16,157
- Wipe it off.
- Put the gun down.

230
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:22,118
Goddamn you.

231
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:27,358
Drop your guns. Don't turn around.

232
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:32,556
I can't believe you were going to do
what you were going to do.

233
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:37,635
- Don't you know who he is?
- You've got the wrong man, Lyle.

234
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,356
Like hell we do.
Just settle down.

235
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:46,399
- Don't come any closer.
- Hand me that gun.

236
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:54,957
- Empty them. We're in enough trouble.
- Your life's going down the toilet.

237
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:59,398
When the truth comes down,
I'll be just fine.

238
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:04,350
I'm taking him
to the sheriff's office in Riley.

239
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:07,912
Let's go!

240
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:33,439
- Now what?
- We're going to Riley.

241
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:47,270
- Can you use the radio?
- I'd better let you out.

242
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:51,433
They won't hurt you if I'm here.
Talk to them on the radio.

243
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:55,673
- What are we going to say?
- That we're turning ourselves in.

244
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:04,354
Buckle your seatbelt.
Do mine.

245
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:21,554
Can you hear me?
We're turning ourselves in.

246
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:31,118
We are turning ourselves in.
Do you read me?

247
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:37,633
We just want to turn ourselves in!
Do you read me?

248
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:54,717
Take the gun. Use it.

249
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:58,156
- Shoot somebody?
- Aim for the tires.

250
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:03,519
They're going to kill us.

251
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:08,592
Use it. Shoot them.

252
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:18,914
Use the gun.

253
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:26,238
Shoot back!

254
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:43,833
- I dropped the gun.
- You what?

255
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:59,318
Take the shot gun.

256
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:22,828
Hold on.

257
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:55,598
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

258
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:09,672
Go, you son-of-a-bitch.

259
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:18,798
Let's get out of here.

260
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:26,915
- Why didn't he kill us?
- Let's go.

261
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:32,993
Why didn't he kill us?

262
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:38,435
Let's go.

263
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:41,232
Are you okay?

264
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:48,629
Why did you pick him up?

265
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:55,997
I wanted to help him.

266
01:05:56,160 --> 01:06:01,598
I was tired.
I thought he'd help me stay awake.

267
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:08,309
Can I sit by you?

268
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:23,989
- What are you doing? No calls.
- It's only my father.

269
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:29,359
No calls, not until I figure out
what we're going to do.

270
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:34,592
- I can explain it.
- It's not that simple.

271
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:39,312
I've already tried.

272
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:42,992
I'm scared.

273
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:48,593
Me, too.

274
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:46,159
Nash...

275
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:51,152
Are you awake?

276
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:13,709
No, I'm okay.

277
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:18,389
I just want you to know
where I am.

278
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:31,397
Everybody has got
this whole thing wrong.

279
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:35,392
I sound funny,
but I'm okay.

280
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:35,713
Nash?

281
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:43,273
Nash!

282
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:17,871
Take it easy now.
Are you Jim Halsey?

283
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:22,556
- Who are you?
- Esteridge. We spoke on the radio.

284
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:27,236
- Where is she?
- We need your help.

285
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:43,512
Hold your fire.

286
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:55,077
- No, don't.
- Why don't you do something?

287
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:58,312
We can't.

288
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:12,960
If we shoot him, his foot slips,
that truck is going to roll.

289
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:20,679
You get in there
and see what you can do.

290
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:26,276
Please, help.

291
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:11,959
She's sweet.

292
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:22,395
The gun is loaded.

293
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:27,431
Go for it.
Go ahead. Pick it up.

294
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:36,276
I'll let you hold the gun on me
before I do anything.

295
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:40,957
They'll catch you.

296
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:47,150
Yeah, sure. So what?

297
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:57,032
Pick up the gun.

298
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:05,436
Put it in my face.

299
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:08,512
Right there.

300
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:16,471
That's good.
You know what to do, now do it.

301
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:20,638
Squeeze the trigger.

302
01:16:26,240 --> 01:16:29,277
She'll die.

303
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:55,554
You useless... waste.

304
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:22,637
I can't tell you
how sorry I am for you, son.

305
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:30,036
Anything I can do for you?

306
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:38,635
You should probably go
and see a doctor for a full check-up.

307
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:44,514
We all know
there was nothing you could do.

308
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:56,077
- Who is he?
- We don't know.

309
01:17:56,240 --> 01:18:01,360
No prison record. No driver's
license. No birth certificate.

310
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:06,355
We ran his prints,
but we came up with nothing.

311
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:11,950
Right now, I don't even know his name.

312
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:21,152
How do you feel?

313
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:25,313
Tired.

314
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:29,189
He can't see us or hear us.

315
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:33,356
I want to talk to him.

316
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:36,796
What's your name?

317
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:45,156
Come on. What's your name?

318
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:52,995
- Do you have a name?
- John Ryder.

319
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:04,717
- What did he say?
- His name is John Ryder.

320
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:09,674
Do you have a police record?

321
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:16,072
Where are you from?

322
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:21,636
Disneyland.

323
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:27,920
- How long do we keep playing games?
- Can you give me a minute?

324
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:21,548
All right, that's enough.
This was a bad idea.

325
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:42,955
All right, get in the car.

326
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:53,312
Are you okay?

327
01:22:58,280 --> 01:23:01,272
You'll never hold him.

328
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:04,512
You listen up now, son.

329
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:08,798
I know there's something going on
between the two of you.

330
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:16,150
But he's in our hands now. We'll
decide what happens to him, not you.

331
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:22,555
It doesn't have anything to do
with you anymore. Okay?

332
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:45,359
- Can I have a cigarette?
- Sure.

333
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,958
Stop the car.

334
01:23:57,240 --> 01:24:00,073
You're not going to use that thing.

335
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:06,519
Stop the car
and don't do anything stupid.

336
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:22,959
All right, what's on your mind?

337
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:27,393
Get out.

338
01:24:28,240 --> 01:24:33,712
You're going to get yourself killed
or end up in a whole lot of trouble.

339
01:24:36,040 --> 01:24:40,591
I'm sorry, sir.
It's something I've got to do.

340
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:46,756
- You don't know what you're doing.
- Yeah, I do.

341
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:36,275
Hi, kid.

342
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:54,196
Come on.

343
01:28:23,680 --> 01:28:26,035
Come on!

344
01:28:27,035 --> 01:28:37,035
