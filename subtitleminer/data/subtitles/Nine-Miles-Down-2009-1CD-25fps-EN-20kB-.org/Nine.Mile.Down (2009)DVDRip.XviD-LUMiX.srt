1
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,600
Central Sahara, North Africa

2
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,500
Base to Mobile 4

3
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,100
Base to Mobile 4

4
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,400
Jack, are you there?

5
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,800
- Still in traffic, Kat.
- What's your location?

6
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,500
ETA in...
about under an hour.

7
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,500
Is there any luck?.
You heard any news from them?

8
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,200
No one for the past 72 hours

9
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,800
- There's no time, move faster.
- Don't worry, Kat.

10
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,500
- sure does not become any problem.
- You be careful.

11
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,800
You call for help when something goes wrong.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,300
- And you fallback safe.
- We will, God bless you, Kathy.

13
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:27,700
Hello?

14
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,500
Hello?

15
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,800
GNE security here..

16
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,200
Anybody home?

17
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,300
Hello?

18
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,000
GNE security.

19
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,200
Open the door.
It's a help.

20
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,400
They drew markings right into the jackal...

21
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,900
writing blood on the walls.

22
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,800
You're fucking kidding me
What does it say?

23
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:38,200
I don't know it's in Arabic.
but it's nothing to get into talk about.

24
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,100
25 people vanished,
leaving blood and bullet holes...

25
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,300
- So when do we have hump?
- Kat, I'll be fine.

26
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,100
there are some other buildings I could check out but not in this

27
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,600
and it's gonna be dark soon.
Who's on graveyard?

28
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,900
Alex.

29
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
- Tell him I'm checking again at 2100.
- You bet.

30
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,600
and inform Caswell.
Over and out.

31
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,800
,,Emal Duwayce?

32
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:27,400
Professor Borman, would you mind sharing with us,
what is attracting you and your team...

33
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,300
... to research one of the remotest location in the Sahara?

34
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,000
It's not the Sahara that say, is attracting me.

35
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,000
-... but what lies far beneath it.
- What is it that you're hoping to find?

36
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:39,300
Genaueres should reveal more
at the press conference later this afternoon...

37
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,600
... that seismographic data has revealed
a fast geological anomaly...

38
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,300
... deep within the Earth's crust.

39
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,600
Welcome...

40
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:01,400
I expect you're wondering why I've summoned you this day.

41
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:07,100
Come in, yes you
don't be shy..

42
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,500
There are plenty of seats here at front.

43
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,300
I'll start again..

44
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:18,500
I've summoned you here today
to announce our groundbreaking objective.

45
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,400
To drill deeper than ever before human history.

46
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:25,600
to unlock the mysteries
hidden deep below the Earth's surface.

47
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,400
Jebel Afra is one of the remotest areas in Sahara...

48
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,100
and also the location of a former natural gas exploration site.

49
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:37,600
Seismographic data recently detected a massive
underground cavity opened 9 miles down.

50
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:41,200
Now that new techniques make it viable to dig deeper,
a much bigger crew...

51
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,400
...are put together in a team of international researchers...

52
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,600
and local workers to lease the site and resume drilling.

53
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,600
Some team members are looking to find

54
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,000
... new independent vehicled life forms.

55
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,900
perhaps extremophiles
such as hepothermials.

56
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,700
9 Miles Down!

57
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,300
...but you can trust all colleagues
in the Institute

58
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,700
I don't think it's the Isolation Room

59
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,000
they were all experienced to fieldwork,
as they used to have. No, no.

60
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,600
This is different...

61
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,500
There are bizarre expeculations and
soul searching about the ethics of what we're doing.

62
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,600
there were only local drilling,
that, I could understand.

63
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:53,900
There were supertitious Berbes,
who talked of having disturbed some spiritual realm.

64
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,800
But it's affected us all, I mean...

65
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,400
Dr. lvanov and I are engaged in long and
heated discussions...

66
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,200
... about the meaning of good and evil.
It's bizarre.

67
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,200
Oh, God.

68
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,000
Hello...?

69
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,200
- Anybody here...?
- Mobile 4.

70
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,400
Mobile 4...

71
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:51,000
- Morning, Kat.
- Any development?

72
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,400
- I'm just checking something out...
- Checking what?

73
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,700
Jack?

74
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,600
- Seems I may have some company.
- Jack, what is it?

75
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,400
I'll get back to you.

76
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,600
You gotta be kidding me.

77
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,200
Morning.

78
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,700
- It's about fucking time!
- What?

79
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,100
- Let me get change then we can go.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, who are you?

80
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:53,000
- What's been going on here?
- It's a long story.

81
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,000
The sooner we get out of here,
the better.

82
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,000
- Are you alone?
- Not anymore.

83
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,300
Hello lady?

84
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,900
Look ahh...

85
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,500
I don't know how long you're gonna pee,
but I need some answers.

86
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,600
And who are you?
Where is everyone?

87
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:21,000
One question at a time.
I'm Dr. Jenny Christianson. ,,J.C.

88
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,100
I'm a research colleague of
Professor Borman.

89
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:28,000
- What do I call you?
- Jack... It's Thomas Jackman.

90
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:32,700
- Poeple call me Jack.
- Please to meet you, Jack.

91
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,300
Yeah, likewise.

92
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:40,400
So they've sent you here,
to rescue me? That's wonderful.

93
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,900
Late, but wonderful.

94
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:47,800
I'm looking forward spending tonight
in the best hotel in a really big town...

95
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,600
... with lots of people and noise.

96
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:55,400
I'll throw you in all the details
on the way. It's a long trip.

97
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,100
Why don't you start now?

98
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,200
What do you know so far?

99
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,800
Oh, no one has heard anything
from you since Sunday.

100
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:07,400
- What do you know of our work here?
- Just let me ask a question.

101
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,600
- Who are you exactly?
- I already told you my name...

102
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,900
Thomas Jackman.
Yes, I know.

103
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,500
but by whose authority,
are you here questioning me?

104
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,800
- GNE Security.
- Yeah, this is a private project.

105
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:24,200
The company you leased asked
for us to check up on you.

106
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,200
So...

107
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:35,000
Well, the first thing you wanna know:
is that our project leader Professor Borman, is dead.

108
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,100
Dead?

109
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,000
He was shot.

110
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:02,400
By Doctor Ivanov, our chief geologist.
in a bit of rage.

111
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,300
How close was Ivanov to Borman,
when he shot him?

112
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,800
5 maybe 10 meters...

113
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,300
I wasn't there.
Does it matter?

114
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,100
Dr. Varga.
a Hungarian researcher.

115
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,000
- Apparently a heart attack.
- Would you forget about this one?

116
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:27,200
Look, Jack, I don't wanna be a hiccup
in your investigation...

117
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:30,400
... but if you don't mind we really need to leave,
as in now.

118
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,100
Yes, well that might be the case,
but...

119
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,700
... I'm gonna have to call in
for some instructions first.

120
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,800
We're gonna need a place.
Something weird is going on here.

121
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:44,400
Hold it there...
Linda, get me Caswell. The situation's escalated.

122
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,900
so what now, Jack? Protocol is
that you abandon the crime scene.

123
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,400
I know that. Tell it to the doctor
she's off to pack her things.

124
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,200
She seems pretty
clean to leave.

125
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,000
- She?
- Didn't I mention...

126
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:00,300
- Dr. Christianson's a woman
- No, you didn't Jack.

127
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,500
- What is she like?
- She's pushy or should I say, suspicious.

128
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:08,700
- Much like yourself.
- Well, you left out stunningly attractive.

129
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,600
Just get the authorities
out here will you.

130
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:15,200
Jack, Caswell here.
You and your doctor have to sit tight.

131
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:18,700
All available resources are being allocated,
to search in for the missing crew.

132
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,400
I want you there in case,
some of them starts to wander back in.

133
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,800
Yes sir, this is a suspected homicide,
the need to bring up further investigation.

134
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,700
All the more reason to stay put.

135
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,400
Police will send a chopper
the moment one's available.

136
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,600
You're safe where you are today.
You copy?

137
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,900
Yes, sir.

138
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,800
Hey, are you sure it was murder?

139
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:43,600
Looks like she was hiding to me.
We'll know if it matches with the evidence.

140
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,300
I'll take a second look
and get back to you. Over and out.

141
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,900
I'm all packed.

142
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,000
- You ready?
- Sorry, what?

143
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,700
To rotate out of here...
as in leave.

144
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,400
You said,
Varga died of a heart attack?

145
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:21,000
That was the opinion of our
IMO, Dr. Williams.

146
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,800
All I know is they found him
lying dead on the floor of his quarters.

147
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,500
Can we go now?

148
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,500
You want to be back
on an empty stomach.

149
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,400
- Jack, do be honest, I think...
- Great, coz I'm starving.

150
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,800
I took a wild guess.

151
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,500
- Black, no sugar?
- I drink tea, actually.

152
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:49,300
- You're not married.
- My wife past away six years ago.

153
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,400
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to pry.

154
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,200
What about you?
You have anybody back home?

155
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,600
You mean
like a husband?

156
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,800
I mean like somebody,
who might be worried about you.

157
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,800
- Are you interrogating me?
- Just curious.

158
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:05,600
- What, you a cop?
- Used to be.

159
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,600
What's out there?

160
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,900
But I'd stay away from there
if I were you.

161
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,100
So why the change of scene?
Doesn't it ever get to you?

162
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,800
I love the space.

163
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:27,600
Well, scale and isolation can bring out
the strangest things in people.

164
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:31,200
- Excuse me?
- Doesn't it ever get to a city boy like you?

165
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,400
Tell me about the project.

166
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:43,400
Well about six days ago, just under 47,000 feet,
the driller broke to the top of the cavity.

167
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,300
- It was great.
- And?

168
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:51,600
The truth is we know very little about what
lies before the outer crust.

169
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,800
even on average, it's only
15 miles thick.

170
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:59,400
If the world were an apple,
that would be thinner than a skin.

171
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:03,000
Nobody's ever seen below it.
Let alone taking samples of it.

172
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,400
Takes at least five minutes
to reach the bottom.

173
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,700
You won't hear anything
of that depth.

174
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,600
and when the wind blew...

175
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,900
... the driller sends a noise,
that was like the howling of demons...

176
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,100
- What? The SouthWest Wind?
- Yeah. Hidden superstitions.

177
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,600
Like all the garbage, they scroll
in the dorm walls.

178
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:26,000
- Do you know what it says?
- I don't have to.

179
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:43,000
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm just a little dizzy.

180
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,600
- Why did they write it?
- I don't know.

181
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,800
Seem more like a ritual
than a celebration.

182
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,200
Why weren't you in the video?

183
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,000
Who do you think
took the video?

184
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,400
And you went to have their photos.

185
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:16,400
Oh God, Jack.
Are you okay?

186
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,600
One moment,
let me help you.

187
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,500
Put your arm around me.

188
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:29,300
There've been a lot of
strange accidents lately.

189
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:33,500
Here, lie down.
I'm gonna go get you some ice.

190
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,800
The sooner we can get out of here
the better.

191
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,500
Jack?

192
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,600
God, you looked like you've seen a ghost.

193
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:57,200
Come on, come lie back down.
It's okay.

194
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,200
Jack...

195
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,400
Do believe in the supernatural?

196
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,000
No. Why?

197
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:10,200
- Did you see something?
- No. No.

198
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,600
It's just,
there's so many things we can't explain...

199
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,800
... and I just thought I'll
get a scientific opinion.

200
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:19,300
The way believing the supernatural
doesn't explain anything.

201
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:23,000
We can't have any irrational thought,
just because we don't understand something.

202
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,000
- There is always a logical explanation.
- Says who...?

203
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:30,000
Some people fear the unknown.
And that is dangerous.

204
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,300
But some fear make sense.
As life of fear and pain...

205
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,200
- is a security mechanism.
- Sure, when we still live in caves.

206
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,700
Our instinct to fears
have become a liability.

207
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,400
They lead us to kill each other.

208
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:44,500
Khamsinia Base, Mobile 4.
Base, Mobile 4.

209
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,400
Khamsinia Base, Mobile 4.

210
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,100
Pick up for me, Jack.

211
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,800
Mobile 4.

212
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:59,200
They found a guy stranded in the desert,
Dr. Ivanov from the drilling team.

213
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,900
Ivanov?

214
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,300
- Alive?
- Barely.

215
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,600
But he has some kind of gas sample with him.
We've sent it to the lab for testing.

216
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,200
When are the cops getting here?

217
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:11,600
Their priority's the missing crew
so they've asked them to keep you posted there.

218
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,400
- Did Ivanov say anything?
- Not much.

219
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,000
He's in bad shape, ranting in Russian.

220
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:18,200
- We got Alex to translate.
- Yeah, he was mumbling about...

221
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,800
... something evil being there.
I have no idea what he meant though.

222
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:26,500
That's weird. JC seems pretty
rattled by something too.

223
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,300
That's the other thing:

224
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:33,500
According to JaMc, the company leasing
the site, it was an all-Male team.

225
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,700
- There were no women on the project.
- What? Say it again.

226
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:41,800
They got no record of a Jenny
Christianson, doctor or otherwise.

227
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,600
Are you there?
Jack?

228
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,200
Yeah, yeah, I'm here, Kat.

229
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,200
Send us a photo of her,
we'll check her ID.

230
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:59,600
and the picture of that grafitti,
and I'll get Yousef to translate them.

231
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:02,700
I'll get you those photos.
Out.

232
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,900
JC?

233
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,400
JC?

234
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,300
JC!

235
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,300
Jack!

236
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,300
Where were you?

237
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,900
- Where were you?
- Please don't do that.

238
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,600
I couldn't stand being left out here,
alone again.

239
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,600
- I gotta get out of here.
- But we can't.

240
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,400
I'll be over this thing,
in case any crew returns.

241
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,800
- They'll never return.
- How'd you know that?

242
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:23,100
I'm sorry, I'm...

243
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,900
- How long before help arrives?
- I have no idea.

244
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,200
We're waiting for the police investigation.

245
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:32,000
- Why don't we just drive out on your truck?
- I already told you.

246
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:36,300
When did you join the project, JC?
Were you there from the start or you just signed up later?

247
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,900
From the start,
I told you.

248
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,300
My records said,
there were no women on the team.

249
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,200
There was no
Dr. Jenny Christianson.

250
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,000
You think, I'm lying?

251
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,800
Come with me.

252
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,300
This is dated July 12th to
July 19th.

253
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,300
The first shot the week
of our arrival.

254
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,400
When Borman leasing arrangements,
there were some concerns..

255
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,000
that a single woman
among men..

256
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:06,200
Union rules about separate showers
and toilet facilities and so on...

257
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:09,200
Our research budget was already stretched
and I would have lost my place on the team...

258
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,800
... had I not agreed to share with the men...

259
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,400
... so Borman falsified my name and gender.

260
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,100
There.

261
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,200
Do you still have doubts?

262
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,000
Just your not in the records.

263
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:31,000
Brooks.
I'm registered as Dr. Alan Brooks.

264
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,600
They found Ivanov.
Alive.

265
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,600
That's uhmm..wonderful.

266
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,100
Okay, JC.
What's the full story?

267
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:51,500
You know if I tell you, you'll be like us.
You won't be able to not know.

268
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,600
Try me.

269
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,900
Well, after we penetrated the cavity...

270
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
... we were very keen to find out
what was down there.

271
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:08,000
We stationed a number of remote sensors.
One of them transmits live audio data. Sound.

272
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,600
This is what we're picking up.

273
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,800
- It's almost like wind? Right?
- Yeah. And you agree with me.

274
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:22,100
- Thank God
- Wait. Wait.

275
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,800
All that sound...
Who are them?...

276
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,300
Like people in pain.

277
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,500
No one believed it at first.

278
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,800
That's just bizarre.

279
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,800
- I mean, it's like it's..
- That's how we all felt.

280
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:53,000
And for a time, none of us
wanted to talk about it.

281
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:56,400
This, the drilling crew they begin
mouldering we've released something.

282
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,600
They started seeing things
wandering around the corridors at night.

283
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,200
What things?

284
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,500
Spirits, Poltergeist, Genies...
And, who knows?

285
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:08,600
Obviously, some kind of mass hysteria.
But they believed what they were seeing.

286
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,100
What about the scientists?

287
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:14,800
Dr. Varga said, he woke to see
his dead mother sitting at the foot of his bed.

288
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,900
Carrying the corpse of a
still born twin.

289
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I'm certain it contributed
to his heart attack.

290
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,400
I don't know about you...
but I think I need a drink.

291
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,000
Why didn't you tell me
this earlier?

292
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:32,000
I didn't wanna encourage the
same symptoms in you.

293
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,300
Visions.
Like at the shaft head?

294
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,800
And at the infirmary?

295
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
That's how it starts, Jack.

296
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,200
Sake.

297
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,300
Yeah...cheers.

298
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,500
and you attribute all
of these to...

299
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,500
- Like it's some...
- Why not just say the word, Jack?

300
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,400
What? Hell?
Is that what I'm supposed to think?

301
00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:00,400
That hell is a physical place,
that lies just mile beneath us?

302
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:04,200
and that Borman well,
they drilled into it.

303
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:09,600
People once thought it geographically
real as Cairo and Jerusalem.

304
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:12,400
Those inclined to accept the literal
hell still do.

305
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:16,300
but hell is no more than a spiritual
creation used to instill fear in others.

306
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,600
It's all in our minds.

307
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,200
Hey Yousef...
Would you look at these?

308
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:35,100
Jack just sent them from Jemalafram.

309
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,700
Crazy.
These are characters from old fairy tales.

310
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:43,000
- Do they mean anything?
- They write to vanish evil spirits.

311
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:47,600
- Genia Duwayce...
- What?

312
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:50,800
A devil woman,
she seduce men.

313
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:53,300
It's a morality fairy tale.

314
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:07,500
So that's where you've been hiding.
Beautiful, isn't it?

315
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,500
Yeah.
I should've brought my camera.

316
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,500
Love the way the light
turns in the Sahara.

317
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:17,000
while the air smells of sunset.

318
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:22,600
- I don't smell anything special.
- You don't know what you're missing.

319
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,800
You know
when I was a young boy...

320
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,800
... my mother told me that the sun,
was driven around the world

321
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:32,000
in a chariot roomed
by four horses.

322
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:35,200
And the wizards sprinkled the
stars on the roof of the skies.

323
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:39,400
My mom told me, the sun is one
of a hundred billion in the galaxy.

324
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,900
Which is one of a hundred billion
in the universe.

325
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,200
and that some starlight has traveled
since before dinosaurs roam here.

326
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:50,000
And made its journey...
Right here...

327
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,200
Right now.

328
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,500
That's not a mystery,
that's a fact.

329
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:00,300
Oh, don't you think that's
fancy, little clinical...

330
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,800
... unemotional?
I mean...

331
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,900
The math takes away the poetry...

332
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,200
sensiblehood.

333
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:12,000
Not from me. Science only adds
to the wonder of a sunset

334
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:16,000
... and everything else in the world.
I don't see how it can take away.

335
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,200
What about love?...
Jealousy?

336
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,200
- Phenethylamin.
- Phene... what?

337
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:29,300
A chemical the brain produces
when you fall in love.

338
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,200
And there's Dopamin
and Norephinephrine...

339
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:36,800
So the greatest of all human emotions
can be broken down to...

340
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:39,000
... chemical compound?

341
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,500
The greatest music on Earth can be reduced
to notes on paper...

342
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,000
... but I can still be moved by it.

343
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,200
- Smile.
- Hey! What are you doing?

344
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,500
Delete it.
I wasn't ready.

345
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:06,200
Oh, if you delete it,
I'm afraid, I'm gonna have to shoot you.

346
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,300
What?
Take two!

347
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,100
Well, it shall live this time.

348
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:29,200
Make me a copy.
There's a printer in the lab.

349
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,000
What are we drinking with dinner?

350
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:33,600
You wouldn't have a
Chateau Expensi around here, would you?

351
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,200
Why don't you try Borman's office
while I freshen up.

352
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:39,100
He kept a few nice bottles in
in his bookshelf.

353
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,500
Sue?

354
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,600
What?
Don't you like it?

355
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:58,000
It's for embassy cocktail receptions.
I don't get to wear it much.

356
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,000
Yes, it's beautiful.

357
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:03,600
- Are you alright?
- I...

358
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,600
You left the light on.

359
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,900
- Silly me. You hungry?
- Starving.

360
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,700
- I can do more than study rocks.
- Evidently!

361
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:19,600
Philosophy, Geology, Psychology...?
on top of it, you are beautiful.

362
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:22,700
Close your eyes.
I have something for you.

363
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:28,600
- What are you doing?
- Keep em close...

364
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:33,600
I know it's a little early...
but Happy Birthday!

365
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,000
It's on your ID.

366
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,600
Jack?

367
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,200
I used to think hell was in your head
and heaven in your heart.

368
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,600
Just looks like it's the other way around.

369
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:59,000
You wanna tell me about it?

370
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,100
About her.

371
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:05,200
You don't miss much, do you?
We we're married, six years.

372
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:08,500
With twins.
Ben and Anna.

373
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:15,200
She was unhappy,
I just didn't know how...

374
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:19,800
-... unhappy until she left.
- I thought you said she passed away?

375
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,000
She committed suicide.

376
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,800
Oh, God...

377
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:28,700
It was my fault.
I'm so wrapped up on my craft.

378
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,000
- I failed her.
- That's no reason for her to...

379
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:34,400
She thought that
I was having an affair.

380
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,600
Oh God... Jack...

381
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,400
It was my 35th birthday.

382
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,700
Sue and the kids arranged a
surprise birthday party.

383
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:53,300
I haven't been in the house
for two minutes...

384
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:57,700
... when the bloody pager went off
and I was back out the door again.

385
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,300
Daddy...

386
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,100
Some part of me...

387
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,400
... that some lived on you...

388
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,800
I swear I had this feeling...

389
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:15,400
... I was sicker than my life.
And for the last time..

390
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:19,400
but I just kept walking towards that door.

391
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:24,500
I could've saved my family but
I didn't listen to my gut instinct.

392
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:28,700
And I remained Jack the Cop!
Logical, rational!

393
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,600
You're being too hard
on yourself, Jack.

394
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,400
I'm sorry.

395
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,100
I don't mean to sound insensitive...

396
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:42,200
... but I've seen what can happen
when people abandoned reason.

397
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,200
You could get seriously hurt.

398
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,300
You're a good man.

399
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,300
There's no point in having
to take armor on the outside...

400
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,200
... if your own worst enemy's within.

401
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,200
Thank you.

402
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,200
- Thank you.
- What for?

403
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:12,400
I like you.., and I haven't
felt that in a long time.

404
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,600
Oh, Tom...

405
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,900
Don't call me that.

406
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,000
Okay?

407
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,600
Stop it, stop it.

408
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,600
What is it?

409
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,400
I can't do this.

410
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,400
I'm sorry.

411
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,800
Susan?

412
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,600
JC?

413
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,000
Relax.

414
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:58,300
Put her out of your mind.

415
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,600
Take it off.

416
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:09,900
Hello Tom.

417
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,800
No!

418
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,700
Susan!

419
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:44,600
Did you enjoy fucking her?

420
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,100
JC?

421
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:31,100
It's okay, Jack.

422
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:34,100
It's just me, Jack...

423
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,800
You're dreaming, Jack.

424
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:42,200
Wake up.
You're sleepwalking.

425
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:47,200
- What?
- Whatever you saw, Jack.

426
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:49,100
It wasn't real.

427
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:51,600
It's okay.

428
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:54,800
It's okay.

429
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:01,800
Try and get some sleep.

430
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:17,600
Daddy...

431
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:24,700
Ben?

432
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:33,200
I Love You

433
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:39,500
You.

434
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:02,100
Mobile 4 to Khamsinia Base.
Come in.

435
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:06,400
Khamsinia Base to Mobile 4.
Base, come in, do you read?

436
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,400
Khamsinia Base.
Is that you, Jack?

437
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:11,800
Look Alex, I need some armed support
up here right now.

438
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:14,600
- It's 5 o'clock in the morning!
- I don't care. You don't argue with me.

439
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:17,400
You just bloody do it.
Call in the army, after.

440
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:20,600
I want armed support here now
you understand?

441
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:22,900
- Do you copy me?
- Okay, okay, I got it.

442
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,500
Good. Out.

443
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,200
Daddy, I'm up here!

444
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:32,800
Daddy!

445
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:52,600
- May I join you... God, Jack!
- No!

446
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:00,400
It was you!
You killed them!

447
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:03,100
Jack! Please stop.
No...

448
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:07,600
JC?

449
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:11,000
What have I done?

450
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:28,900
JC?

451
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:36,000
JC?

452
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:50,000
JC?

453
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:45,400
Jack!

454
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:51,400
What did the crew stuffed here,
before you finished them up, JC?

455
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:55,300
That's why you didn't want me to go
to the crust pit, isn't it?

456
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:58,100
- Those are animal carcasses, Jack.
- Were we close?

457
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:05,400
- I don't know who will find this tape...
- I'm thinking that we could both go together.

458
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:07,300
-... and make it that easy for you...

459
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:09,200
... greatest of danger

460
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:11,000
I cannot describe what we're
on against.

461
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:13,300
But I'm afraid, none will
go out here alive.

462
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:16,600
Seems we have released something
from nine miles down.

463
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:19,500
Something of unspeakable evil and cunning.

464
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:23,000
- Jack!
Taking all form.

465
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:28,700
Something disarming and unemotional.

466
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,200
Don't let his trance mislead you, Jack.

467
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:34,800
Behind these lies and deception.
It will trick you.

468
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:38,400
But don't be distracted by the spectacles...

469
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:43,300
Even pain leading us to..

470
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:46,900
It protest all abilities of techie trap.

471
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,800
I came here about you.

472
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:52,600
All cunning, the lies that
wash the consequences..

473
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:58,500
It will try to win your trust,
and before dashing your hopes..

474
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:01,600
- You're lying.
- It will trick you.

475
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:04,900
- You're lying!
- It will confuse you more.

476
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:08,300
- Show no fear.
- Base to Mobile 4.

477
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:11,500
And build on it the time is against you!

478
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:14,400
whatever it is,
it's going to drive the lives...

479
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:33,000
- Stay away from the radio!
- Jack! What are you doing?

480
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:35,200
Resist.
Resist the devil.

481
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:37,400
I know who you are now!

482
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,200
- Dr. Christianson?
- He's shooting at me!

483
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:43,300
- Dr. Ivanov has gone mad.

484
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:46,800
He's got some sample of this pure evil.

485
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:49,400
He proposes to carry out experiments...

486
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:52,900
- Remain calm, we'll get you out of there...
- I'm trying!

487
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,800
but he thinks I'm some kind of devil or something.

488
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:58,700
Kat, don't you listen to her!

489
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:01,600
Jack, we have to leave!
We got to get out of here now!

490
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:07,500
Don't listen to its lies. Never do what
it tells you for you will obeying the devil itself.

491
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:12,300
We have news!
The gas from Ivanov's sample, it's toxic!

492
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,700
- Resist.
- Lies!

493
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:17,600
Jack, we have to leave.
It's dangerous!

494
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:19,400
Dr. Christianson?

495
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:22,800
and may God be with us all.

496
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:02,200
Did you think you can get rid of me?

497
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,000
You know it's not good without the evil, Jack.

498
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,800
No darkness, without light.

499
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,900
They define each other.

500
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:12,700
See?

501
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:17,500
You wanna shoot me?
It'll make no difference...

502
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,800
No difference at all, Jack.

503
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:23,600
Ja...

504
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:28,400
No, Jack, don't!

505
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:01,600
No!

506
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:28,900
Daddy...

507
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:31,800
Daddy...

508
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:35,600
Daddy...!

509
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,600
Daddy...!

510
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,300
Ben?

511
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:42,900
Anna!

512
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:49,200
Come and help Mommy with
the decorations!

513
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:58,800
We don't wanna spoil
the surprise now, do we?...

514
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:03,000
Daddy would be home soon.

515
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:09,000
Dad's gonna love this!

516
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,900
Is that you, Jack?

517
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
How do you want your steak?

518
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,400
Do you like it?

519
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:39,700
- Who are you?
- I'll come clean.

520
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:44,500
You've been right all along.
I was only testing you and you passed..

521
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:48,400
- You and Borman are quite the believers.
- Works for many.

522
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:50,500
It works for me right now.

523
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,600
I thank God for that.
Literally.

524
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:57,200
His very existence defines mine.

525
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,500
We have a lot in common.

526
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:04,100
We're glad when people just accept
what we lead them to believe.

527
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:08,100
No shepherd want a sheep
that think for themselves.

528
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:14,000
- What do you want?
- It's all about what you want here, honey.

529
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:16,600
Something about a second chance?

530
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:20,200
Still can't tempt you?
Okay.

531
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:23,100
I wasn't doing the freeze over.

532
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:26,000
Our father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

533
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:29,300
thy kingdom, thy will be done
on Earth as it is in heaven.

534
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:33,200
lead us not into temptation..

535
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:38,300
I'm sorry, you can never keep a straight face.

536
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:42,300
I always wondered what people would do
had Christ been hanged.

537
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:45,600
Wear many knotches around their necks I suppose.

538
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:48,400
or is it knitches?

539
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:50,600
or knit?

540
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:59,500
I can fill and fuck your brains out!

541
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Oh, Jack...
You're such a...

542
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:10,600
... Gentleman. At least now that I'm
coming out of the closet I can have a smoke.

543
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:13,600
Onions?

544
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:16,900
On your steak?
Onions.

545
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,200
Onions?

546
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:23,000
Onions?

547
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:31,200
Jack... after coming so far...

548
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:33,600
... you're not going to just
throw it all away now, are you?

549
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:37,300
Last chance of getting...

550
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:40,400
... what you wanted most for the past six years?

551
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:45,500
I'm gonna give it to you.

552
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:52,200
Aren't you hungry?

553
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:54,200
It was Susan, wasn't it?

554
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:56,400
She sent you here to test me.

555
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:00,000
So, what is it you want from me?

556
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:01,800
C'mon, Jack.

557
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:05,400
- Think.
- Myself?

558
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:08,500
Is that what you came here for?

559
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:15,300
Okay... but then I get what I want.

560
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:22,100
Okay...
What will I do?

561
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,800
Repeat after me:

562
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,600
Lucifer, I sell you my soul.

563
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:30,400
Six times over.

564
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:33,700
Focus your full concentration.

565
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:37,300
And say it with conviction.

566
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:41,600
- Lucifer, I sell you my soul..
- One..

567
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:45,000
- Lucifer, I sell you my soul..
- Two...

568
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:47,600
- Lucifer, I sell you my soul...
- Three...

569
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:51,000
- Lucifer, I sell you my soul..
- Four...

570
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:54,500
- Lucifer, I sell you my soul..
- Five...

571
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:56,800
The last one's a difficult one.

572
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:03,800
Lucifer...

573
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:08,000
... I sell you my soul.

574
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:12,600
Six. I won't bother you anymore Officer Jackman,

575
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:14,700
you've passed the test.

576
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:19,000
- Is that it?
- I got what I want and so did you.

577
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:21,600
- Where are we?
- Wait outside in your truck.

578
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:25,100
And when Susan comes,
all you have to do is drive away.

579
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:37,400
Going already?

580
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:46,200
Don't leave us again so soon,
the children were so looking forward to it.

581
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:49,400
- but she said that you...
- Who?

582
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:51,700
Hey.. Hey...

583
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:58,800
- Who? The operable lies and deception?
- Daddy, you have to blow out the candle.

584
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:00,600
Make a wish first.

585
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:03,500
Yeah, make a wish Daddy.

586
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:15,500
Blow them all out or it won't come true.

587
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:21,800
Try wishing for something else, Tom...

588
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:23,900
or someone else.

589
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:48,000
I can't do this.

590
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:03,000
- Rather spend your birthday with her?
- No, I'm staying this time.

591
01:04:03,700 --> 01:04:05,500
I'm staying.

592
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:07,600
Come on, Jack.
We have to go!

593
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:09,800
I'll ignore it.

594
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:11,400
- She can go...
- She?

595
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:14,100
You admit it?
You admit it?

596
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:15,800
It's over!

597
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:19,500
It was just one night,
just one stupid night, Susan.

598
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:29,100
- It's your last chance. Susan's waiting.
- No! She's here.

599
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:31,300
They're here.
She's here.

600
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:35,000
That's not Susan, Jack.

601
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:39,600
Look at her, Jack!

602
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,100
Tom, we must hurry.

603
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:52,100
We can leave now!
It's me, Susan!

604
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:55,900
It's me.

605
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,600
No!

606
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:07,100
Susan?

607
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:23,800
- Susan?
- Yes, Tom.

608
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,800
Thank God.
Come on, we can start over now.

609
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:29,200
We've been given a new chance.

610
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:36,800
- We did it honey. You rescued me.
- Daddy?

611
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:39,800
- But the kids?
- Dad! Help!

612
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,300
- Did you hear them?
- No, it's nothing, let's go, Tom.

613
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:46,200
- No, it's them. We can't leave here without them.
- No, Ben and Anna are at home waiting for us.

614
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,400
It's just the wind, Jack.

615
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:53,600
- It's just the wind.
- When is their birthday?

616
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:57,200
Please say you love me, Jack.
Say it.

617
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:02,800
I love you...

618
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:07,900
Go back to hell, JC...

619
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:53,300
We had a deal!

620
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:25,800
Jack!

621
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,300
Jack!

622
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:31,400
You're hallucinating.
Breathe!

623
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:33,400
Come on.
It's oxygen, Jack.

624
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:34,900
Breathe, Jack!

625
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:38,300
Come on, Jack.
Breathe. Breathe!

626
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:42,700
Over here!

627
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:44,900
- Where's the girl, Jack?
- Who?

628
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,500
- Dr. Christianson.
- JC? She's not real.

629
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:49,200
- Yes, she is, Jack.
- What?

630
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:52,100
She is. She's telling the truth.
Come on, Jack.

631
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:53,900
She's right, her story...
Get down.

632
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,200
Look at me...
Where is the girl? The doctor?

633
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:58,900
She's one of the scientist!

634
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:03,400
- They had her under a different name.
- Jack, where is the girl?

635
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:09,400
- JC?
- Oh my God!

636
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:12,100
The cavity was probably full in over 60
million years ago.

637
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:15,300
and had trapped a huge mass
of compressed organic matter...

638
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:17,900
... tormented to early form of Psylocybin growth.

639
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,600
Now I think the only explanation,
that makes any sense:

640
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:24,700
Is that you are in inhaling an odorless
by product of the places.

641
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:29,400
It's a hallucigenic gas, which impairs
rational and cognitive functions of the brain.

642
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:32,800
So why is it the end of the world's longest joint.

643
01:11:32,900 --> 01:11:35,800
It seems it disabled your ability to discern,

644
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:40,700
... between reality, memory and imaginative
creations...

645
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:42,800
To you they all seems to be one.

646
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:45,300
So what I believed to be real,
became real to me?

647
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:49,000
Yeah, what you wanted to believe
what you are afraid of believing.

648
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:51,000
And what about Borman?

649
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:55,600
Well, like you and everybody else.I think his own personal hell
was brought to the surface by the gas.

650
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:58,700
- What about JC? How does she cope?
- Well, a number of factors.

651
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:01,600
Everybody living up in the main complex,
was accumulating toxins.

652
01:12:01,700 --> 01:12:05,000
- She was far as exposed.
- What about the voices?

653
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:11,000
- I mean, the screaming in the shaft head?
- Well, my guess would be:

654
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:13,800
Miles of Metal against stone.
Or the wind.

655
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:18,600
Merely by the power of suggestion
the mind is capable of creating patterns.

656
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:20,300
Even in white noise.

657
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:22,800
- But...
- Forget the noises.

658
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:27,600
Inspector Coolidgeman found two furgal forces
stranded 50 km out from where he come off.

659
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:29,800
Footprints leading up in all directions.

660
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Realistically, there's very little chance
of finding any of them alive.

661
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:37,100
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

662
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:41,400
Come on,
look on the bright side.

663
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:44,200
There's no hell
and she's not the devil.

664
01:12:44,300 --> 01:12:46,400
That's gotta be something.

665
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:51,600
- I feel I'm just missing something here.
- You saw all the evidence.

666
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:56,400
Why do you throw away all rational
explanation for the sake of that 1% of doubt?

667
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:00,200
I don't know.

668
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:27,300
- Good morning.
- Hi.

669
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:31,200
- Forgive me?
- What's there to forgive?

670
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:35,100
Well, you seem pretty tolerant,
someone tried to kill you.

671
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:38,700
- We both got a little messed up.
- Yeah, and I'm...

672
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:41,300
How's your wound?

673
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:43,500
How's yours?

674
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:45,200
Which one?

675
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:53,600
Is it my imagination or did I...

676
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:57,500
... did I really sell you
me soul back there?

677
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,300
Jack!

678
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:06,400
You should see your face.

679
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:10,500
Oh it's just a chunk,
it's a...

680
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:14,600
I had to play along
with your delusion.

681
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:18,700
I would have played any character,
to lure you away from there.

682
01:14:23,700 --> 01:14:27,400
- I suppose I owe you dinner then, huh?
- Yeah...

683
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:39,600
I should let you rest.

684
01:14:40,700 --> 01:14:41,600
I've got it!

685
01:14:41,700 --> 01:14:43,800
And this will prove she
wasn't there from the start.

686
01:14:43,900 --> 01:14:45,900
The only image we have of her,
is on this footage...

687
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,600
... which was supposedly was
taken weeks ago.

688
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:50,900
- And...?
- My cap is in the background of the shot!

689
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:54,500
- What the hell are you trying to prove?
- That she staged all of this.

690
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:56,100
There!

691
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:59,000
- David, can you zoom in on it?
- Yeah, sure.

692
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:07,700
- It's like a safety helmet to me.
- Maybe there's something else further on.

693
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:15,300
Oh man, you're behaving as if you're
soring up to a thrown hell out there...

694
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:19,600
You're on extended sick leave
until further notice.

695
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:23,700
Jackman! your gun.

696
01:15:54,900 --> 01:15:58,800
Well, speaking of the devil...
it's Jack.

697
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:04,500
Hey Jacko.

698
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,800
You alright?

699
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:10,000
- What's wrong?
- It's her.

700
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:13,500
- Jack, what!
- You almost got away with it, didn't you!

701
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:20,100
- Jack, what are you doing?
- I'm seeing you as you really are.

702
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:22,000
- What are you talking about?
- Jack!

703
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:24,300
Fuck off! You don't understand,
you haven't seen what I've seen!

704
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:26,600
- Jack, please explain.
- Explain?

705
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:29,200
- Yes...
- So you could twist the truth again?

706
01:16:29,300 --> 01:16:31,700
No, not this time.
No, shut up!

707
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:33,700
Please. Please, Jack.

708
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:35,900
No, not this time, JC..

709
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:39,900
You've run out of lot
of explanations.

710
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:43,300
It is the devil!

711
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:46,300
Please, Jack. no.

712
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:50,500
- It's courage!
- No, no, no.

713
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:54,300
Let go of me!

714
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:56,700
You have to understand!

715
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,300
Who are you?

716
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,400
I don't know you.

717
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:18,100
Who are you?

718
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:21,600
You are laughing at me.

719
01:17:23,100 --> 01:17:24,800
Oh, God.

720
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:07,200
Hell is in your head.

721
01:18:08,900 --> 01:18:11,600
There's always a logical explanation.

722
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:17,800
Your anger settles right in yourself tight.

723
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:23,500
It's all in your mind.

724
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:29,800
I'm fine.
I'm fine.

725
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:46,000
To fear the unknown is dangerous.

726
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Stop!

727
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:56,500
Call the doctor!

728
01:18:58,300 --> 01:19:01,300
- It's not her blood, it's not her blood!
- I'm fine.

729
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:03,200
Jack went crazy again.
He stole my gun.

730
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:06,700
- He ran into the quarter. He's nuts.
- He's gonna do it like Borman and Susan.

731
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:10,800
He's gonna do...
He's gonna do it like Borman und Susan.

732
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:39,500
Okay, Sue, you win.
I'll give you what you want.
