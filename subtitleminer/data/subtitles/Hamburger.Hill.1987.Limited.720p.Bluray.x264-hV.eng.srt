Oh, shit! Medic, god,

00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:44,116
Get me the bird down here.

8
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:44,825

00:03:48,203 --> 00:03:52,583
Identify our location on my smoke.
There are people all over. It's over.

11
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,211
Let's get outta here.

12
00:04:03,885 --> 00:04:05,012
Cover the right side.

13
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:10,975
Move on! Move on!

00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,646
Let's go!

00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:16,689
I said come on!

16
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:46,593
What's your name?

17
00:04:46,676 --> 00:04:49,054
Mark beach.

18
00:04:49,596 --> 00:04:50,763
Where are you from?

19
00:04:50,804 --> 00:04:51,889
Portwavs.

20
00:04:52,933 --> 00:04:54,642
Talk to me! Talk to me!

21
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,314
That's hell of a town I hear.

22
00:05:01,273 --> 00:05:02,357
Troop!

23
00:05:33,971 --> 00:05:36,766
Come on, girl-san. Tell me how
you say that one more time.

24
00:05:38,977 --> 00:05:42,771
Hey, why don't you ask her how
to say 'jailbreak'... in Vietnamese?

25
00:05:45,816 --> 00:05:48,694
Look at him man, who does he think
he's kidding over there?

26
00:05:49,486 --> 00:05:54,324
Hey Languilli, you'd better get your ass back in this truck.
or her father's going to come out and cut your dick off.

27
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:57,953
Ok, girl... wait, wait...

28
00:05:58,913 --> 00:06:02,081
Who are you kidding man? You wouldn't know
what to do with her if you do get her.

29
00:06:04,501 --> 00:06:06,336
Unbelievable

30
00:06:09,505 --> 00:06:12,843
You souvenir me this,
I tell you. You number one.

31
00:06:12,884 --> 00:06:14,594
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

32
00:06:16,262 --> 00:06:17,723
Hey, troop!

33
00:06:18,682 --> 00:06:21,559
Your dick will fall off if you
get any closer to that pussy.

34
00:06:21,642 --> 00:06:24,521
They'll keep you in the Philippines
with the black VD. You'll never get home.

35
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,192
Get your ass back on that truck!

36
00:06:45,498 --> 00:06:46,834
Sergeant, Frants?

37
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:50,127
I thought you bought a waterbuffalo
and your own rice paddy to shit in.

38
00:06:50,211 --> 00:06:51,671
Where the hell have
you been, young stuff?

39
00:06:51,754 --> 00:06:52,714
Surfing.

40
00:07:08,396 --> 00:07:10,856
I met a nurse.
- Yeah.

41
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,441
Round-eye.

42
00:07:13,275 --> 00:07:14,318
You didn't?

43
00:07:14,401 --> 00:07:16,446
She had her own trailer on the beach.

44
00:07:16,529 --> 00:07:17,447
Oh, no.

45
00:07:18,072 --> 00:07:19,948
I figured what can they do to me?

46
00:07:19,989 --> 00:07:23,619
Send me to Vietnam?I moved in with her.

47
00:07:24,578 --> 00:07:25,662
A round-eye?

48
00:07:25,704 --> 00:07:26,747
There it is.

49
00:07:26,788 --> 00:07:28,873
The Mama's and Papa's
found me on the beach.

50
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:30,291
Surfing?

51
00:07:39,508 --> 00:07:41,052
Sit down, Vinstak

52
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,061
What the hell are you
wearing that shit for?

53
00:07:52,354 --> 00:07:55,066
It's gonna dehydrate your ass
and not do you any good.

54
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:57,986
But, Sarge, they told us at
Division training we had to wear...

55
00:07:59,778 --> 00:08:03,198
We had a... we had
a short time at once.

56
00:08:03,281 --> 00:08:06,994
Johnny, I forget his name...
he wore a flack jacket

57
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:09,454
two helmets... and armour underwear.

58
00:08:10,038 --> 00:08:14,083
Ashau Valley. If your
time's up, your time's up.

59
00:08:18,046 --> 00:08:20,006
What's the Anshaw Valley?

60
00:09:14,433 --> 00:09:15,768
Hey, ladies, are you free tonight?

61
00:09:34,786 --> 00:09:37,746
Let's go. Which way is it?

62
00:09:43,586 --> 00:09:46,172
Goddamn, look at this!

63
00:09:47,214 --> 00:09:49,842
I'm going to put the new guys in your squad.
- Oh shit!

64
00:09:49,925 --> 00:09:51,385
Hey, don't 'oh shit' me, troop.

65
00:09:51,426 --> 00:09:54,639
The old man has me breaking-in another new Lieutenant.
He looks like Palmolive-fucking-soap.

66
00:09:54,722 --> 00:09:56,599
Yeah, well I don't need
this f-n-g shit, Worcester.

67
00:09:56,683 --> 00:09:59,100
Yeah, well write you Congressman
and you can tell him. I need a steak...

68
00:09:59,226 --> 00:10:01,478
a bucket of cold beer and a round-eye
to wrap my leg around.

69
00:10:04,356 --> 00:10:05,857
Lieutenant Eaden.
- Sergeant?

70
00:10:05,899 --> 00:10:07,192
How are you?

71
00:10:12,239 --> 00:10:16,493
Watch your backs. Come on this
isn't a parking lot for Christ's sake.

72
00:10:16,577 --> 00:10:17,577
Come on, Gaigin.

73
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:22,332
Here you go.

74
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:24,709
That all you got?

75
00:10:25,752 --> 00:10:27,670
What did they say that signal
for incoming rounds was?

76
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:30,339
Hey man, I can't tell the difference
between incoming and outgoing.

77
00:10:30,423 --> 00:10:33,051
I dove off the shitter up at Evans
and it was our stuff going out.

78
00:10:33,134 --> 00:10:34,802
I think it's two long sirens.

79
00:10:34,886 --> 00:10:36,095
Don't worry about it.

80
00:10:36,179 --> 00:10:40,223
Hey man, I'm not worrying about it. I just think that it's
important to know the signals for incoming rounds, all right?

81
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,685
Don't worry nobody's
getting in here tonight.

82
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:44,687
What's the signal for ground attack?

83
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:45,730
Three short ones.

84
00:10:45,771 --> 00:10:47,063
Green star cluster.

85
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:50,024
Oh yeah, that's great for a night time,
what are we gonna do during the day?

86
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:52,361
Did you know that bird shit and paratroopers
are the only things that fall out of the sky?

87
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,241
Sarge. Are there any women here?

88
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,621
Hey, I'm not screwing any whore.

89
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:05,581
Shit!

90
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,457
What man, you'd eat her pussy.

91
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,586
Hey man, if you can't try it,
I don't eat it.

92
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:13,590
A year is a long time, tellows.

93
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,095
That's Clare.

94
00:11:22,764 --> 00:11:25,476
If she's fucking for peace man,
I'm on the wrong side.

95
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,606
Stop it, back off.

96
00:11:33,316 --> 00:11:35,944
Cool it!

97
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,987
I'm marrying her, man.

98
00:11:38,613 --> 00:11:40,532
I meant nothing by it.

99
00:11:42,158 --> 00:11:43,076
Beletsky.

100
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:44,536
Languilli.

101
00:11:45,994 --> 00:11:48,289
Shake hands, Man.

102
00:11:48,331 --> 00:11:52,126
We're airborne.
We don't Start fights.

103
00:11:53,502 --> 00:11:55,213
We finish'em.

104
00:12:01,051 --> 00:12:02,845
Vincent Languilli.

105
00:12:02,928 --> 00:12:04,847
Joseph Beletsky.

106
00:12:17,692 --> 00:12:19,194
Mama San!

107
00:12:19,277 --> 00:12:21,571
Sergeant Watkistin!

108
00:12:21,654 --> 00:12:24,741
Hi. Where have you been for so long?

109
00:12:26,867 --> 00:12:28,536
Bye-Bye.

Ahhh, I like it hot.

113
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:55,562
I want to get this red dirt out of my body.

125
00:13:46,193 --> 00:13:49,822
Arvin is useless. He's tired
of fighting your fuckin war.

126
00:13:49,906 --> 00:13:53,200
My fuckin war? My fuckin war?

Gl never leave. No question.

133
00:14:27,775 --> 00:14:36,491
Hey, you were, as you were.

134
00:14:36,992 --> 00:14:46,876
The question is, how many of us have to boom boom before
those mean little bastards from the North show up.

135
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,755
Now that's the question.
- Yahoo!

136
00:15:16,697 --> 00:15:20,409
Welcome to the first platoon. I'm Lituenant Eaton.
Follow us with me if you will, gentlemen.

137
00:15:20,534 --> 00:15:23,996
Put your full name on line one.
Address on line two.

138
00:15:24,037 --> 00:15:27,791
All right, if you do not want anyone notified in
case of injury, check box three.

139
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:32,129
Otherwise, fill in the name. Last name first,
first name last and address on line four.

140
00:15:32,212 --> 00:15:34,423
Line five is for beneficiary.

141
00:15:34,464 --> 00:15:39,303
All right, you have in your possession forms
for savings bonds, serious E types.

142
00:15:39,844 --> 00:15:43,972
Actually, I highly recommend this plan for you men.
It's a good plan for the future.

143
00:15:44,057 --> 00:15:46,684
The white card should be
filled out by married men.

144
00:15:46,767 --> 00:15:50,063
This allows for joint access to
your funds in case of an emergency.

145
00:15:50,563 --> 00:15:52,440
You have postcards, fill these out.

146
00:15:52,482 --> 00:15:55,400
Let you're family know your safe,
how to get in touch with you.

147
00:15:55,442 --> 00:15:58,445
All right, mail is a priority.
You don't need stamps.

148
00:15:58,487 --> 00:16:03,909
You can write on a sea rat box, address it,
it will be delivered free of charge. Questions?

149
00:16:41,988 --> 00:16:42,822
Brother blood.

150
00:16:42,906 --> 00:16:43,822
How's it going, Doc?

151
00:16:43,906 --> 00:16:45,323
By hand, brother.

152
00:16:45,407 --> 00:16:48,076
How're doing man?
- How's it happenin' brotha?

153
00:16:48,118 --> 00:16:52,039
Buzz around camp is...
Doc's just got back from R and R.

154
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,999
And you're going to tell me
all the horny, jacking off details.

155
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:57,586
Bangkok is not unbelievable man.

156
00:16:57,752 --> 00:16:59,504
What happened after
I got Med Evacuated

157
00:16:59,629 --> 00:17:01,756
Charley had the shit together.
You hear me?

158
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,966
Speedy.
- Who?

159
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:06,928
The shit burner from second squad.
- Traumatic cranial contusion. I couldn't ventilate him.

160
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:08,930
Brother Jones got blown to shit.

161
00:17:08,972 --> 00:17:10,849
Who's Jones?
- The FNG man.

162
00:17:10,932 --> 00:17:13,308
He knew everything
the Temptations ever did.

163
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:15,435
Make sure we got some
brothers in the squad.

164
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:20,817
I don't want to hear no more of that rebel.
I lost my car on the mother fucking road.

165
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:25,321
And I'm crying over you.

166
00:17:25,404 --> 00:17:30,159
Hey Sarge, Sarge. Look a minute.
I've got a flash for you.

167
00:17:31,577 --> 00:17:34,329
Some brother I was hanging out
with over at Delta company.

168
00:17:34,412 --> 00:17:35,998
Drives iron raven.

169
00:17:36,832 --> 00:17:41,211
Don't shit me, Sarge. Rumor has it
we're going back into the Ashau.

170
00:17:43,505 --> 00:17:44,756
Shit.

171
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:49,803
Come on Sarge, man you know. I'm too short for that shit.
The Doc ain't gonna give me a profile.

172
00:17:49,886 --> 00:17:52,264
Why don't you see if there's a job
for me over at headquarters.

173
00:17:52,347 --> 00:17:56,184
They don't take niggers
back at headquarters, brother.

174
00:17:56,225 --> 00:17:58,561
All the white mother
fuckers are back there.

175
00:18:03,523 --> 00:18:05,442
Remove the protective
wrapping from the tooth brush.

176
00:18:05,525 --> 00:18:07,361
Put the wrapping next
to your left foot.

177
00:18:07,402 --> 00:18:09,989
Open the tooth paste with
the cap on top of wrapping.

178
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:13,450
Now put general amount of
paste on the sterile bristles.

179
00:18:14,033 --> 00:18:18,037
People you will brush your teeth
in rapid verital motion for one minute.

180
00:18:18,622 --> 00:18:21,041
That's up and down for
you rebel mother fucker.

181
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:25,128
When I say Start, you turn
to your right, you brush. Ready?

182
00:18:27,213 --> 00:18:28,256
Brush.

183
00:18:32,426 --> 00:18:35,345
You may notice a granular taste.
That's pumice.

184
00:18:35,387 --> 00:18:38,725
It's puopse is to seal the teeth
and allow the flouride to penetrate.

185
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:43,895
Gentlemen, in Vietnam, you will be
confronted by many organisms.

186
00:18:43,937 --> 00:18:48,734
In food, water, air...
that are foreign to Amercan bodies.

187
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:56,533
Ringworm and Pataygo and Malaria,
ameobic dysentary and crotch rot.

188
00:18:56,574 --> 00:19:03,372
It has been found that proper dental hygene is important
component in maintaining of a healthy fighting man.

189
00:19:06,167 --> 00:19:08,837
What are you doing?

190
00:19:10,046 --> 00:19:11,840
Come on lighten up Bro.

191
00:19:22,349 --> 00:19:23,976
I am not your brother.

192
00:19:24,935 --> 00:19:28,773
Now did I tell you to spit?
- No, sir.

193
00:19:31,941 --> 00:19:34,653
If you wanna walk outta
this fucking place,

194
00:19:34,778 --> 00:19:37,948
you will listen to people who know.

195
00:19:38,031 --> 00:19:46,622
You be an individual, and I'll tagging your ugly toothless
face on it's way to a long box with metal handles.

196
00:19:46,664 --> 00:19:50,251
Now brush your teeth in a
rapid vertical motion.

197
00:19:51,294 --> 00:19:52,502
Troop!

198
00:19:59,552 --> 00:20:00,678
Let's go!

199
00:20:01,803 --> 00:20:04,431
Rise! Awake! Salute!

200
00:20:04,473 --> 00:20:09,853
Another glorious morning.
You scroungy ass sons of bitches.

201
00:20:09,938 --> 00:20:12,064
You found a home in the army,
Wortchester.

202
00:20:12,147 --> 00:20:13,481
Hey thanks to hear you yong fellow.

203
00:20:13,523 --> 00:20:16,819
Hey I'm low life of forty one
and wake up and out side of Vietnam,

204
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,654
Viet fucking green machine.

205
00:20:18,737 --> 00:20:22,449
I'll probably be a fucking civilian with places to go,
people to see. Things to do.

206
00:20:29,248 --> 00:20:33,376
I want you to keep on eye on these guys.
In case we gotta go back to Ashau.

207
00:20:35,294 --> 00:20:36,795
Don't mean nothing.

208
00:20:38,965 --> 00:20:41,341
Man, don't these people
play no Tammy Wynette.

209
00:20:46,972 --> 00:20:48,474
Did you sleep last night?

210
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:49,934
I kept seeing things.

211
00:20:50,017 --> 00:20:52,352
What do you mean
you kept seeing things?

212
00:20:54,855 --> 00:20:56,064
Did you sleep?

213
00:20:58,692 --> 00:21:00,027
Did you hear something?

214
00:21:00,069 --> 00:21:03,154
Oh this is bull shit.

215
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,406
You gotta sleep.

216
00:21:06,783 --> 00:21:09,036
What are gonna do
stay hear for years?

217
00:21:11,412 --> 00:21:12,747
All right, listen up.

218
00:21:14,499 --> 00:21:17,001
You people are not dying
on me in combat.

219
00:21:17,043 --> 00:21:19,962
You fucking, new guys will do
everything to prove me wrong.

220
00:21:20,004 --> 00:21:22,839
You'll walk on trails, kickcans... sleep
on guard, smoke dope and diddely-bop...

221
00:21:22,923 --> 00:21:25,634
through the bush like you were back
on the block.

222
00:21:26,219 --> 00:21:30,348
On guard at night you'll write letters, play with your organ...
and think of your girl back home. Forget her.

223
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:33,558
Some hair head has her on her right now...
and is telling her to fuck for peace.

224
00:21:33,641 --> 00:21:35,060
This is Han.

225
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:45,404
Those of you who are foolish will think
of him as... gook, slope, slant or dink.

226
00:21:45,487 --> 00:21:46,613
He is your enemy.

227
00:21:46,696 --> 00:21:51,492
He came over on the Chieu Hoi programme.
And he will go back there after he fattens on C-rations.

228
00:21:51,575 --> 00:21:55,121
And he will be hunting your
young asss in the Ashau Valley.

229
00:21:55,205 --> 00:21:57,082
Now forget about this Viet Cong shit.

230
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:01,877
What you'll encounter out there is...
hard core. NVA,north Vietnamese...

231
00:22:02,002 --> 00:22:04,254
motivated, highly trained
and well equipped.

232
00:22:05,297 --> 00:22:07,800
If you meet Hanor his cousins,
you will give him respect.

233
00:22:07,925 --> 00:22:11,011
And refer to those little bastards
as the Nathanial Victor.

234
00:22:11,595 --> 00:22:16,600
Meet'em twice and survive, you will
call him mister Nathanial Victor.

235
00:22:17,434 --> 00:22:22,688
People, I am tired... of filling
body bags with your dumb fucking mistakes.

236
00:22:24,565 --> 00:22:25,943
Do you think this funny?

237
00:22:29,738 --> 00:22:30,988
Alphabet.

238
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:32,239
Languilli.

239
00:22:33,407 --> 00:22:36,911
Han is closing in on your position.
It's night, look at me.

240
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,914
I'm gonna save your life
and your gonna save mine.

241
00:22:41,665 --> 00:22:43,459
It's night, it's raining.

242
00:22:43,501 --> 00:22:46,462
While you're thinking about peace,
love and whether or not we should be in Vietnam.

243
00:22:46,545 --> 00:22:50,173
Han is going to cut your fucking throat. And your sleeping.
No, Sergeant.

244
00:22:50,257 --> 00:22:53,927
You've been humping the boonies for months.
Your turn to sleep, your allowed to sleep.

245
00:22:54,094 --> 00:22:57,222
What do you think Han is going to do?
Is he going to wake up Alphabet and smile?

246
00:22:57,306 --> 00:22:58,724
And talk about women?

247
00:22:58,808 --> 00:23:02,101
Mister Nathanial Victor gets his
rocks off watching you die.

248
00:23:02,977 --> 00:23:05,355
Some of you think you have problems
because your're against the war.

249
00:23:05,439 --> 00:23:09,526
You demonstrated in school... you wear peace symbols on your steel.
And you have attitudes.

250
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:16,116
I'm orphan, my brother's queer, the city of
Chicago got the clap from my sister.

251
00:23:16,157 --> 00:23:17,826
Mum drinks, Dad coughs blood.

252
00:23:17,909 --> 00:23:20,202
I have ring worm, emersion
foot... the incurable crud

253
00:23:20,285 --> 00:23:23,581
and the draught ruined my chances
of being a brain surge on people.

254
00:23:23,664 --> 00:23:25,290
You have no problem.

255
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:29,670
Except me.

256
00:23:31,505 --> 00:23:32,839
And him.

257
00:24:39,194 --> 00:24:40,320
Hey, pal.

258
00:24:43,866 --> 00:24:46,703
You know where I can
find general Rufferman?

259
00:24:47,244 --> 00:24:51,290
Not friend of mine.
He is major genral, two stars.

260
00:24:51,373 --> 00:24:53,917
I am supposed to deliver
this to trailer to him.

261
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:55,961
And I can't find anyone to sign for it.

262
00:24:56,087 --> 00:24:57,964
Hey I'll sign for it.

263
00:24:58,006 --> 00:24:59,882
I'm responsible for this.

264
00:25:00,507 --> 00:25:01,549
Well look at it.

265
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:04,219
Keepin the army forever to pay it off.

266
00:25:04,261 --> 00:25:08,098
Everybody shoots at me.
Especially grunts.

267
00:25:10,683 --> 00:25:13,603
I'm just rolling highway
sinder hunt and seek.

268
00:25:14,228 --> 00:25:16,606
Listen, maybe you can
get a marine to sign for it.

269
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:21,985
Yeah. Yeah, thanks a lot.
Those guys are dancing.

270
00:25:39,628 --> 00:25:41,380
This is one weird place.

271
00:25:43,257 --> 00:25:48,553
Seventeen fucking wake up
and I'll never eat this shit again.

272
00:25:48,636 --> 00:25:52,432
You hear what I'm saying sarge?
- We are in the army, man.

273
00:25:53,516 --> 00:25:55,226
What are you gonna do when
you are back in the world?

274
00:25:56,436 --> 00:26:00,272
I got places to go,
things to do, people to see.

275
00:26:00,314 --> 00:26:01,983
Yeah but how are you gonna act?

276
00:26:03,985 --> 00:26:08,864
Like a PFC, Private fucking civilian.

277
00:26:08,947 --> 00:26:11,992
You are talkinig, you don't know
what you're saying, brother.

278
00:26:12,075 --> 00:26:13,994
You ever heard of boony rap?

279
00:26:14,078 --> 00:26:16,914
Fuck this, shit on that, no fucking way.

280
00:26:16,998 --> 00:26:19,249
I love that mother fucking bastards.

281
00:26:19,332 --> 00:26:22,044
You back off Motown
cuz I got my fucking act.

282
00:26:27,174 --> 00:26:30,301
Look man, I got my act together. OK?

283
00:26:30,343 --> 00:26:32,261
My shit's straight man.

284
00:26:33,096 --> 00:26:36,641
You know a straighter and more intellegent brother
in first platoon then me?

285
00:26:37,767 --> 00:26:41,187
Hey listen up, he's got college.

286
00:26:42,938 --> 00:26:45,733
One time I went home
on special emergency leave,

287
00:26:45,816 --> 00:26:48,152
My mama made me a
special meal man with

288
00:26:48,193 --> 00:26:53,323
everything I love, I mean greens,
fresh vegetable, potatos, candies...

289
00:26:53,365 --> 00:26:55,075
I happened to like baked ham.

290
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:00,664
So whole my family was there, and I said to myself, Motown
you got these people fooled.

291
00:27:00,747 --> 00:27:03,792
I mean the day before that,
we were humping in Ashau valley,

292
00:27:03,875 --> 00:27:06,295
and now I'm home with my family.

293
00:27:06,378 --> 00:27:09,380
And I'm skatin man.
No problems. Number one.

294
00:27:09,464 --> 00:27:13,718
I smile at my mama. Great meal, ma.

295
00:27:14,886 --> 00:27:17,805
Would you please pass the fucking potatoes.

296
00:27:20,141 --> 00:27:24,311
The ham is fucking A, ma.

297
00:27:25,605 --> 00:27:29,441
You don't know how... how
fucking great it is to be home.

298
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:35,906
How you gonna act, huh?

299
00:27:36,615 --> 00:27:38,575
You really want to know, Motown?

300
00:27:41,745 --> 00:27:44,539
I'm gonna walk down Central Avenue.

301
00:27:45,248 --> 00:27:47,626
My jump boots, my medals.

302
00:27:49,753 --> 00:27:51,671
Shit, it's gonna be all right.

303
00:27:52,422 --> 00:27:54,132
You'd better not wear your uniform.

304
00:27:55,133 --> 00:27:56,926
Who's talking to you?

305
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:07,812
This man... has been fighting for the
fucking United States of white America.

306
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:14,569
And you going to try to advise him...
that he can't wear his jump boots.

307
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:19,239
You guys... don't know shit.

308
00:28:38,215 --> 00:28:40,760
Commending General believes that
one of the most depressing problems

309
00:28:40,843 --> 00:28:44,389
we face in Vietnam today
is Vineraal disease.

310
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:48,892
We have found the best way of contracting any one of
the nine known strands

311
00:28:48,976 --> 00:28:55,441
of Syphilis, and or Gohnorrea is
to avoid contact with the indigenous.

312
00:28:55,524 --> 00:28:57,860
Vietnamese female personnel.

313
00:29:00,904 --> 00:29:08,244
However, remember, lie da
homo chai bokoo eeon.

314
00:29:08,286 --> 00:29:11,164
Lie da homo chai bokoo eeon.

315
00:29:11,247 --> 00:29:15,210
It' the same anywhere Galvan.
You got to know the right words to score.

316
00:29:18,963 --> 00:29:20,423
I'll go get us some shampoo.

317
00:29:37,856 --> 00:29:38,815
Tafee.

318
00:29:38,857 --> 00:29:40,317
What are you doing?

319
00:29:41,985 --> 00:29:43,237
It's called meditation.

320
00:29:48,241 --> 00:29:49,784
How do you know
whether or not it's working?

321
00:29:51,036 --> 00:29:53,997
Incoming!

322
00:30:07,385 --> 00:30:10,846
Cold steel. Check point five... Two. Over.

323
00:30:11,847 --> 00:30:13,474
Fire Major. Over.

324
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,521
Fire Major. Over.

325
00:30:21,982 --> 00:30:24,985
They must have a
spotter in that tree line.

326
00:30:47,256 --> 00:30:49,926
Fire! Standing by

327
00:30:52,595 --> 00:30:56,515
Rounds out. Rounds out. Rounds out.

328
00:31:34,469 --> 00:31:37,012
Cease fire. Cease fire!

329
00:31:46,187 --> 00:31:49,774
Red 16. This is 16.
What's the situation. Over.

330
00:31:51,318 --> 00:31:56,322
Red 16. This is 16.
What's the situation. Over.

331
00:32:17,509 --> 00:32:18,469
Who is it?

332
00:32:20,011 --> 00:32:25,183
How the hell do I know.
He's got no goddamn head.

333
00:32:27,811 --> 00:32:29,646
It's one of the new guys.

334
00:32:30,856 --> 00:32:35,234
You got to tell these men to put an extra set of I.D.
tags on their boots one each.

335
00:32:35,317 --> 00:32:39,739
Then this kind of shit wouldn't happen.
How the hell am I supposed to identify these people.

336
00:32:42,909 --> 00:32:44,868
Now you take it easy, Doc.

337
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,047
I'll take it any way I can.

338
00:33:05,472 --> 00:33:07,849
I've got to know who you are.

339
00:33:11,687 --> 00:33:13,063
How's this. How's this?

340
00:33:21,487 --> 00:33:23,365
Where's Gates?
- He's in there all night.

341
00:33:23,991 --> 00:33:26,909
I know I'm going to be next.
I know that, Goddammit!

342
00:33:27,702 --> 00:33:31,163
I'm next, Doc.
- You ain't next!

343
00:33:31,247 --> 00:33:32,374
I'm next, Doc.

344
00:33:32,415 --> 00:33:36,960
I don't care what y'all say.
You got that life all you want.

345
00:33:37,043 --> 00:33:42,883
Now we'll see, Goddammit.
I'm tired of all your shit.

346
00:33:42,925 --> 00:33:46,094
Seven cards are squared.
Single titties are wild.

347
00:33:49,264 --> 00:33:50,182
You say it boss.

348
00:34:43,482 --> 00:34:47,069
Yeah, you could fart in a balloon and
paint it red and Marine would love it.

349
00:34:47,904 --> 00:34:48,821
It's true.

350
00:34:56,162 --> 00:34:57,746
Your too big for her.

351
00:35:00,791 --> 00:35:03,418
What's Elstavitz doing? Vinstock.

352
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:06,379
I don't know Sarge.
- You should.

353
00:35:06,463 --> 00:35:07,965
Is he...

354
00:35:08,674 --> 00:35:11,093
You white boys are strange about that.

355
00:35:13,136 --> 00:35:16,180
Don't get lost Beanie. Wooahh.

356
00:35:17,056 --> 00:35:20,184
Watcha doin' in Vietnam. Boy.

357
00:35:23,396 --> 00:35:25,106
Volunteered, bro.

358
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:29,152
You know, the brothers
are here, because we're black.

359
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:31,321
They don't think we're educated.

360
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:33,655
That's bullshit.

361
00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:43,665
Say what FNG? FNG?

362
00:36:00,015 --> 00:36:02,350
Hey Andy, lack off, lack off!

363
00:36:02,392 --> 00:36:08,230
My name isn't Alphabet. It's Languilly, Vinny.
- My first name is Vincent.

364
00:36:09,983 --> 00:36:11,901
What's my name, Doc?

365
00:36:13,611 --> 00:36:15,238
You're name is Vincent.

366
00:36:18,282 --> 00:36:19,908
All right, get him outta here.

367
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:27,875
You Gl's are all...

368
00:36:31,253 --> 00:36:33,129
You people will not
die on me in combat.

369
00:36:33,212 --> 00:36:34,839
Galvin was good.
He always did everything right.

370
00:36:34,881 --> 00:36:37,509
What difference does it make. We've been up and down
this same terrain since I got here. For what?

371
00:36:37,592 --> 00:36:38,718
All right look.

372
00:36:38,885 --> 00:36:40,721
When you get home.
You can throw your boots away.

373
00:36:40,762 --> 00:36:42,972
Grow a beard, become
a Goddam hippie protestor.

374
00:36:43,055 --> 00:36:43,848
I don't want to hear this shit.

375
00:36:43,931 --> 00:36:46,309
Look, I know too many
Goddamm names, Wortchester.

376
00:36:46,892 --> 00:36:49,770
And I don't think one of them is
worth all of Vietnam Republic of...

377
00:36:49,896 --> 00:36:52,148
Look just don't fall apart on your people, Francz.
- Oh why not?

378
00:36:52,773 --> 00:36:55,525
So I can teach 'em how to fill sand bags and burn shit.
- Hey!

379
00:36:56,569 --> 00:36:58,863
They're gonna need you in
the Ashau. We're going back in.

380
00:36:59,363 --> 00:37:01,032
What the hell you think
I brought you here for.

381
00:40:55,632 --> 00:40:58,468
Red six, Red six.
Red one six Charlie. Over.

382
00:40:58,510 --> 00:40:59,803
Red six. Over.

383
00:40:59,886 --> 00:41:01,679
We got LG secure.

384
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:02,971
Negative contact. Over.

385
00:41:03,138 --> 00:41:06,809
Yo Mire! Francz. Smitty!
Move these people out.

386
00:41:08,936 --> 00:41:10,979
You'll do fine LT. Just fine.

387
00:41:13,356 --> 00:41:14,942
These guys know
what they're doing.

388
00:41:14,983 --> 00:41:16,485
Oh yeah, most definitely.

389
00:41:29,872 --> 00:41:33,418
10-May-69

390
00:42:30,931 --> 00:42:34,977
Fuck you!
All of you mother fuckers!

391
00:42:40,023 --> 00:42:40,565
Fuck!

392
00:42:55,288 --> 00:42:55,914
Bitch!

393
00:42:59,249 --> 00:43:00,835
Movin up Mac, on line!

394
00:43:03,796 --> 00:43:06,215
Washburn, Beletsky,
Bienstock. Move out!

395
00:43:07,383 --> 00:43:09,676
Hey! Gimme some ammo!

396
00:43:11,512 --> 00:43:12,888
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry!

397
00:43:13,805 --> 00:43:15,266
Get down! Get down!

398
00:43:15,307 --> 00:43:17,268
Give it to me! Give it to me!

399
00:43:17,309 --> 00:43:20,103
You're giving it to me,
you fucking idiot! Give it!

400
00:43:22,355 --> 00:43:23,816
Tafee, Gaigin, Move up!

401
00:43:23,857 --> 00:43:28,278
Move! Keep going! Comon!
Move! Goddamnit! Mother fucker.

402
00:43:38,996 --> 00:43:42,625
Fuck! Got to move in...

403
00:44:08,983 --> 00:44:12,362
Doc! They got Mac! They got Mac!

404
00:44:15,698 --> 00:44:17,575
Did you see him?
- No.

405
00:44:18,993 --> 00:44:20,369
We got a blood trail.

406
00:44:20,411 --> 00:44:21,746
Find the little bastard.

407
00:44:38,136 --> 00:44:40,305
You're on point.
- Me?

408
00:44:40,347 --> 00:44:43,683
You've got no friendlies out there.
Got a full load.

409
00:46:20,234 --> 00:46:23,196
Nathanial Victor. FNG type.
Walking around the Ashau

410
00:46:23,238 --> 00:46:26,157
with a half a canteen,
that makes a lot of noise.

411
00:46:27,825 --> 00:46:28,658
Where's the body?

412
00:46:31,954 --> 00:46:35,875
Maggie Kung fleet foot, face full of
black soot talking at the heat put

413
00:46:35,958 --> 00:46:39,044
plants in the bed but don't stop them
anyway. Maggie says all right.

414
00:46:39,127 --> 00:46:43,006
Here it is, October 19th.
We have been here six months.

415
00:46:43,089 --> 00:46:46,009
Now that's half way. All right?
Now I'm going to mark myself in blue.

416
00:46:46,092 --> 00:46:49,512
But I got different color pens for everybody.
You can be red if you want to be. O.K.

417
00:46:49,554 --> 00:46:51,932
But what I gotta know is did Washburn
get here the same day as us?

418
00:46:52,015 --> 00:46:53,433
Yes.
- O.K.

419
00:46:54,184 --> 00:46:57,186
And that other guy and alphabet the day before.
- Thank you sir.

420
00:46:58,479 --> 00:46:59,772
Hey guys, check this out.

421
00:47:02,191 --> 00:47:03,651
Love this Camaro.

422
00:47:03,735 --> 00:47:05,695
It's you. It's a ride, man.

423
00:47:15,663 --> 00:47:17,580
We did good today, didn't we?

424
00:47:19,041 --> 00:47:21,752
We got our cherries busted
today, didn't we Sarge?

425
00:47:25,715 --> 00:47:27,340
One of my people got killed.

426
00:47:29,383 --> 00:47:30,760
That's all that happened today.

427
00:47:37,225 --> 00:47:40,353
You knew that man wasn't going to
slack off because he was short.

428
00:47:43,189 --> 00:47:45,358
You knew that brother
was going do his job.

429
00:47:45,525 --> 00:47:47,401
Then why didn't you put him on profile.

430
00:47:47,526 --> 00:47:50,655
Because... he is one healthy individual.

431
00:47:50,738 --> 00:47:54,909
I've got people in this fucking platoon
who are so sick they wouldn't be allowed in the hospital.

432
00:47:54,992 --> 00:47:57,703
But out here they have to
ruck up, move out and press on.

433
00:47:59,413 --> 00:48:00,914
It don't mean nothing, man.

434
00:48:00,997 --> 00:48:02,416
It don't mean nothing...

435
00:48:05,544 --> 00:48:06,544
Come on, man...

436
00:48:06,627 --> 00:48:10,423
You owe it to yourself... yourself.

437
00:48:19,223 --> 00:48:22,184
It don't mean nothing. Not a thing man.

438
00:48:22,268 --> 00:48:43,956
It don't mean nothing. Not a thing.

439
00:48:43,998 --> 00:48:48,084
Right. You don't mean
nothing brother, not a thing.

440
00:48:48,167 --> 00:48:54,716
It don't mean nothing man,
not a thing. Nothing.

441
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:15,361
We got a.. we got McDaniels
body on a trailor truck.

442
00:49:20,782 --> 00:49:23,244
All he wanted to do was go
home in his jump boots.

443
00:49:26,954 --> 00:49:28,957
Couldn't believe they called him a jerk.

444
00:49:30,625 --> 00:49:31,877
And worse.

445
00:49:35,755 --> 00:49:40,594
Ya know, people get hurt out here.

446
00:49:40,635 --> 00:49:45,014
C'mon. Don't tell me he died for God,
country and one-hundred and first airborne...

447
00:49:45,098 --> 00:49:47,975
Hey man, I'd never
say that shit to anybody.

448
00:49:49,935 --> 00:49:51,145
Dan didn't die for anything.

449
00:49:51,229 --> 00:49:55,523
He didn't leave his goddamn guts on a
goddamn trail in goddamn Ashaw Valley.

450
00:49:55,565 --> 00:49:58,652
For a home town medal
or any of that bullshit.

451
00:50:02,281 --> 00:50:05,491
Cranked his automatic weapon
and took it out. For you and for

452
00:50:05,534 --> 00:50:08,953
the third squad. Man, don't you
give him anything less.

453
00:50:11,707 --> 00:50:13,875
You get out of this valley, Worcester.

454
00:50:15,793 --> 00:50:17,420
I'm gonna kick your ass.

455
00:50:21,883 --> 00:50:24,844
Battalion wants us to go back to
where Frantz made contact today.

456
00:50:24,885 --> 00:50:28,723
They say there are some stragglers
left on this area Hill 937.

457
00:50:28,806 --> 00:50:31,726
Those KIA's were clean and well
equipped. They weren't stragglers.

458
00:50:31,768 --> 00:50:36,397
Military Intelligence says there is no organized...
Military Intelligence could fuck up a wet dream, sir.

459
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:41,277
All right man, let's call it. All right? We're on the same side here, right?
Tomorrow morning we'll just get our people quietly off this hill.

460
00:50:41,444 --> 00:50:46,281
Tomorrow we'll recon 937,call in alog
bird for hot chow and clean socks.

461
00:50:47,490 --> 00:50:49,701
Isn't that right, Lieutenant?

Murphy's calling in. H and I delta line

463
00:50:56,332 --> 00:50:59,252
Squad leaders make sure
your people have

464
00:50:59,335 --> 00:51:03,882
dry socks, clean water,
salt fill, ammo, just in case.

465
00:51:08,219 --> 00:51:10,596
Alright gather around.
C'mon. Listen up.

466
00:51:14,516 --> 00:51:17,186

467
00:51:26,736 --> 00:51:28,780
Red Six 1-6 Charlie. Over.

The 1-6 Charlie preparing to assault
the 3-0 north of the faze line. Over.

469
00:51:37,372 --> 00:51:38,957
All right, we're getting 2 T small arms.

470
00:51:38,999 --> 00:51:41,709
May 11 From up there Black Jack
wants up to mop up any stragglers.

471
00:51:41,751 --> 00:51:46,255
First and second squad and move out from here.
I want you to take your people and move them in a flanking position.

472
00:51:46,964 --> 00:51:49,133
Make believers out of
these sorry ass bastards.

473
00:51:53,054 --> 00:51:55,221
O.K. Let's move it.
Second squad. Move on.

474
00:51:56,390 --> 00:51:57,558
First squad. Move out.

475
00:51:58,726 --> 00:51:59,810
This isn't the plan we worked out man.

476
00:51:59,852 --> 00:52:01,354
We're supposed to be
going up that other hill.

477
00:52:01,437 --> 00:52:05,732
It's the same old shit man.
Man and bird wants to play war.

478
00:52:33,343 --> 00:52:36,636
Red six... out this is 1-6 out...
Brad! Move your people!

479
00:52:47,731 --> 00:52:51,527
Red six... out this is 1-6 out mark
four coordinates for cold steel. Over.

480
00:52:51,568 --> 00:52:52,361
Tuffy!

481
00:52:54,279 --> 00:52:56,947
Take your weapons forward until
your covering far into the friendlies.

482
00:52:57,615 --> 00:52:58,951
Move. Move. Move.

483
00:53:00,869 --> 00:53:03,246
Put you around
seventy five meters down.

484
00:53:13,464 --> 00:53:14,548
That's what I wanted.

485
00:53:25,433 --> 00:53:27,936
These proper radio procedure...

486
00:53:59,842 --> 00:54:01,052
Hear from your old lady?

487
00:54:03,136 --> 00:54:04,471
ever happened.

488
00:54:27,952 --> 00:54:30,329
Languilli, remember the basic?

489
00:54:30,371 --> 00:54:33,541
They told us the way to cover an eye
in case the flareoes so that we lose our night vision?

490
00:54:33,582 --> 00:54:34,375
They said that.

491
00:54:34,458 --> 00:54:35,918
OK, so what they meant?

492
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:39,547
Does it matter if which eye we cover?

493
00:54:39,630 --> 00:54:43,633
Good eye for the night vision
or the one for the flare.

494
00:54:44,342 --> 00:54:48,889
Beletsky do you stay awake at night thing of
the things you should worry about?

495
00:55:04,654 --> 00:55:05,946
What are you doing?

496
00:55:05,988 --> 00:55:07,532
We were just having
some hot chocolate.

497
00:55:08,658 --> 00:55:10,660
You here anything.
- Nothing.

498
00:55:10,701 --> 00:55:14,246
Camp on the Delta Post.
Same same. Negative sit rep.

499
00:55:14,371 --> 00:55:16,165
Looks like we're gettin' out
of here tomorrow.

500
00:55:16,290 --> 00:55:19,085
I'm going straight to the PX
and ordering that Firebird.

501
00:55:21,003 --> 00:55:22,295
What happened to the Camaro?

502
00:55:26,675 --> 00:55:28,677
My dad won't drive
anything but a Buick.

503
00:55:38,353 --> 00:55:39,938
Push in on the bullshit net.

504
00:55:40,814 --> 00:55:41,981
What's the bullshit net?

505
00:55:42,023 --> 00:55:43,274
Hanoi Hanna.

506
00:55:43,357 --> 00:55:46,694
Best sounds in the valley.
And boy does she have a rap.

507
00:55:47,361 --> 00:55:48,697
We love you too much...

508
00:55:48,738 --> 00:55:52,115
drop your weapons and Uncle Ho
will give youa water buffalo...

509
00:55:52,199 --> 00:55:54,368
your own rice paddy to shit in.

510
00:55:57,580 --> 00:56:02,167
Sometimes they get American assholes...
to tell us what assholes we are.

511
00:56:04,711 --> 00:56:06,671
No lie, man. It's a trip.

512
00:56:07,547 --> 00:56:09,967
American soldiers... and marines

513
00:56:10,092 --> 00:56:15,680
embrace the heroic people of Vietnam...
like many of your heroic countrymen...

514
00:56:16,723 --> 00:56:19,726
why fight the heroic
people's army... while your own

515
00:56:19,768 --> 00:56:24,021
Government betrays you... and the heroic
American friends of Vietnam...

516
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:26,649
If you have to smoke it at nigh
put a poncho over your head.

517
00:56:26,732 --> 00:56:31,736
and I would like to send this special dedication...
to the Screaming Eagles in the Ashau Valley.

518
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:36,242
You may be killed any
time day or night...

519
00:56:36,325 --> 00:56:39,829
like your shadow, death is following you...

520
00:56:39,912 --> 00:56:41,747
Everywhere.

521
00:56:50,047 --> 00:56:52,424
Bad dream.

522
00:56:56,970 --> 00:56:58,972
How much am I supposed to
remember all this shit.

523
00:56:59,056 --> 00:57:01,974
Panchos over your head,
no half canteens.

524
00:57:02,016 --> 00:57:06,270
Dog tags on your boots.
Carry the claimor detonator while your setting them up.

525
00:57:06,354 --> 00:57:09,273
Orange pills once a week,
whites daily, daily.

526
00:57:09,816 --> 00:57:13,944
Oh don't ever walk on trails.
Boot in the sock. Harrows on the water.

527
00:57:14,027 --> 00:57:17,448
Secure your frags.
And now, now this bullshit.

528
00:57:17,490 --> 00:57:20,410
And the whole time, I'm worried
I might forget something.

529
00:57:48,937 --> 00:57:50,647
All right, on your feet, wake up..

530
00:57:50,688 --> 00:57:51,981
it's time to earn your combat pay.

531
00:57:52,023 --> 00:57:53,733
Come on.
- Come on. Let's go.

532
00:57:55,359 --> 00:57:56,944
Hey Motown, fuck you!

533
00:57:57,028 --> 00:57:58,821
I need some goddamn boots, Sarge.

534
00:57:58,905 --> 00:58:00,906
My whole fucking body hurts.

535
00:58:00,989 --> 00:58:02,115
My dick hurts!

536
00:58:02,157 --> 00:58:03,659
Then drop ten and beat it.

537
00:58:04,535 --> 00:58:06,287
I don't want to hear
anymore of this shit.

538
00:58:06,995 --> 00:58:08,622
Now you get your
head out of your asses.

539
00:58:09,498 --> 00:58:11,458
Black Jack wants us to take this hill.

540
00:58:11,499 --> 00:58:13,001
What's he going to do with it?

541
00:58:15,712 --> 00:58:18,590
Pave it and turn it
into a goddamn parking lot.

542
00:58:19,174 --> 00:58:20,342
Now move out.

543
00:58:34,730 --> 00:58:37,692
Cold steel, cold steel
this is 1-6 alpha, over.

544
00:58:37,733 --> 00:58:39,945
Tell 6 that the little bastards
have got some Claimors in the trees

545
00:58:40,028 --> 00:58:41,403
And they're blowing the shit out of us.

546
00:58:41,445 --> 00:58:42,779
So get us some goddamn fire support.

547
00:58:42,863 --> 00:58:45,657
Cold steel, cold steel.
This is 1-6 alpha, over.

548
00:58:48,035 --> 00:58:49,453
Come in 2-0

549
00:58:49,537 --> 00:58:51,371
There wounded out could be
pressing fire from that bunk line.

550
00:58:51,412 --> 00:58:52,539
pressing fire from that bunk line.

551
00:58:52,623 --> 00:58:53,123
No shit.

552
00:58:53,248 --> 00:58:55,334
Worcester, pull these men out.

553
00:58:57,253 --> 00:58:58,712
Move it out! Move it out!

554
00:59:04,217 --> 00:59:07,304
15 may

555
00:59:10,765 --> 00:59:12,809
My leg! Fuck!

556
01:00:12,157 --> 01:00:13,784
You're mine! Mother fucker!

557
01:00:32,426 --> 01:00:33,845
You fuckin' stink!

558
01:00:34,679 --> 01:00:35,471
Tuffy!

559
01:00:42,311 --> 01:00:43,103
Watch out!

560
01:00:49,526 --> 01:00:52,195
Clear this area Motown!
Cover it point blank!

561
01:00:52,237 --> 01:00:53,823
Set up that gun!

562
01:00:56,826 --> 01:00:57,451
Where's Doc?

563
01:00:59,578 --> 01:01:02,622
Get him and the horn and tell him
we got his goddamn bunker!

564
01:01:03,540 --> 01:01:04,999
Run the horn.

565
01:01:05,041 --> 01:01:06,167
I can't hear you.

566
01:01:06,209 --> 01:01:08,086
1-6 Johnny!

567
01:01:09,795 --> 01:01:11,714
It's 1-6 out there over!

568
01:01:16,469 --> 01:01:17,678
C'mon, help me down there.

569
01:01:17,762 --> 01:01:19,638
There's nothing wrong with you.

570
01:01:19,721 --> 01:01:20,931
Get down there.

571
01:01:22,808 --> 01:01:24,310
Talk to me! Talk to me!

572
01:01:27,814 --> 01:01:30,982
Say Alphabet! Alphabet! Say it!

573
01:01:32,317 --> 01:01:35,821
Cmon Tuffy! Tuffy! Say Alphabet!

574
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:03,597
Sarge,

575
01:02:04,765 --> 01:02:07,643
I asked everybody who they think.

576
01:02:08,936 --> 01:02:12,314
Nobody did it. Was it you?

577
01:02:12,439 --> 01:02:14,233
Maybe he died of natural causes.

578
01:02:17,612 --> 01:02:19,320
Half his head was blown away.

579
01:02:20,154 --> 01:02:21,906
Sounds like a natural cause to me.

580
01:02:22,031 --> 01:02:23,700
When can you get him out of here?

581
01:02:25,744 --> 01:02:29,205
In a boot coot fucked up dude from
the second squad ahead of Tuffy.

582
01:02:29,997 --> 01:02:31,291
Hey, it don't mean nothing.

583
01:02:34,794 --> 01:02:36,004
Where's my weapon?

584
01:03:11,830 --> 01:03:13,790
6 speed advisor.
We have taken the bunker

585
01:03:13,832 --> 01:03:15,417
And are preparing to move up the hill.

586
01:03:15,584 --> 01:03:16,876
All right. Worcester.

587
01:03:28,137 --> 01:03:30,639
Let's move people
and take this fuckin' hill.

588
01:03:32,432 --> 01:03:33,475
Let's go!

589
01:04:38,078 --> 01:04:40,998
Get me some ammo!

590
01:04:42,250 --> 01:04:45,711
Tuffy! I'm coming.

591
01:05:22,872 --> 01:05:26,042
No. No cease fire.

592
01:05:29,628 --> 01:05:32,631
Hold it up there firing
at our people. Hold it up!

593
01:05:45,060 --> 01:05:51,274
Stop it! Man! God dammit!
Jesus Christ!

594
01:07:03,343 --> 01:07:06,054
They said they are gonna
send some resupply today.

595
01:07:09,933 --> 01:07:18,358
Get back on your horn and tell them we, our people,
need food and water now not later.

596
01:07:21,026 --> 01:07:25,365
This is 16 alpha over.

597
01:07:32,538 --> 01:07:33,915
Take a look at that map.

598
01:07:38,293 --> 01:07:39,210
Sergent.

599
01:07:45,341 --> 01:07:47,219
We are in Ashau valley.

600
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:51,473
and we ain't going no where
except back up to that goddamn hill.

601
01:07:58,395 --> 01:07:59,814
I'll get you a map.

602
01:08:07,780 --> 01:08:10,949
You put the tape in there
and you press that button.

603
01:08:12,910 --> 01:08:14,370
It's from my girl Claire.

604
01:08:14,412 --> 01:08:15,662
Just don't use all my juice.

605
01:08:18,916 --> 01:08:22,419
Now that's immoral, unjust and illegal.

606
01:08:22,502 --> 01:08:23,713
Get this Beenie.
- What?

607
01:08:26,380 --> 01:08:28,883
Oh my God! They're huge.

608
01:08:29,551 --> 01:08:35,431
She likes to lie naked on the beach.
And have her boyfriend read the profit to her.

609
01:08:35,515 --> 01:08:38,518
Oh yeah, he's probably
a long haired, foureyed faggot.

610
01:08:39,144 --> 01:08:42,147
I just don't know what to say. I-

611
01:08:42,188 --> 01:08:45,024
I don't know what time
it is where you are.

612
01:08:45,107 --> 01:08:48,945
I'd like to wrap his
long hair around my body...

613
01:08:48,986 --> 01:08:52,156
while he makes love
to me all night long.

614
01:08:52,239 --> 01:08:54,783
I had dinner with your Mom and Dad.

615
01:08:54,825 --> 01:08:58,912
We read all your letters and looked at
the pictures you sent.

616
01:08:58,954 --> 01:09:03,376
She became his love prisoner.
She would do anything for him.

617
01:09:03,459 --> 01:09:07,254
Jesus Christ, I'm never going to get another haircut
as long as I fucking live.

618
01:09:07,795 --> 01:09:09,464
If you can... Joe.

619
01:09:10,257 --> 01:09:12,759
Try to smile more in the pictures.

620
01:09:13,385 --> 01:09:14,676
It would help your Mother.

621
01:09:15,344 --> 01:09:17,179
Your dad didn't say much.

622
01:09:17,722 --> 01:09:19,558
We both know what he's like.

623
01:09:20,474 --> 01:09:25,062
Katherine says... he gets up
early every morning and...

624
01:09:25,145 --> 01:09:30,108
watches the news. And he eats his
dinner in front of the TV at night.

625
01:09:30,734 --> 01:09:32,445
I think he's looking for you.

626
01:09:33,488 --> 01:09:39,118
I'm glad you have such good friends
like... like Bienstock and Langarelli.

627
01:09:39,159 --> 01:09:40,535
Languilli.

628
01:09:40,619 --> 01:09:42,663
Galvan and Frantz.

629
01:09:46,666 --> 01:09:48,710
I, I want you to know one thing...

630
01:09:50,546 --> 01:09:54,299
I'll always be true to you.
I'll wait for you.

631
01:09:55,841 --> 01:09:59,095
I know it must be very difficult
for you over there and...

632
01:09:59,179 --> 01:10:02,265
If you can't be true...

633
01:10:03,141 --> 01:10:06,268
if you can't wait... I'll understand.

634
01:10:07,061 --> 01:10:08,855
I know you love me.

635
01:10:10,189 --> 01:10:13,526
I love this woman,
she's telling him to get laid.

636
01:10:17,195 --> 01:10:21,617
I wish you weren't there.
I wish none of you were there.

637
01:10:23,619 --> 01:10:28,748
But I'm proud of you Joe.
I, I, I just don't think it's fair...

638
01:10:28,873 --> 01:10:33,795
that everybody is back here... acting...
acting like nothing is going on.

639
01:10:33,836 --> 01:10:38,507
Their lives are the same.
It's just not fair.

640
01:10:39,801 --> 01:10:42,637
And I don't believe
what they say about you.

641
01:10:44,513 --> 01:10:45,598
Anyhow...

642
01:10:47,433 --> 01:10:51,062
I don't care because I love all of you.

643
01:10:52,397 --> 01:10:58,903
Especially you, my darling.
Especially you my...

644
01:11:02,406 --> 01:11:03,615
Take it easy with that.

645
01:11:04,908 --> 01:11:05,992
I'll take it anyway I can.

646
01:11:06,076 --> 01:11:08,036
I told you not to use all the batteries.

647
01:11:10,747 --> 01:11:12,708
It's the goddamn nigger
music you listen to.

648
01:11:17,420 --> 01:11:19,381
All right, come on. Break it up.

649
01:11:19,422 --> 01:11:21,383
Alphabet, put shovel down.

650
01:11:24,135 --> 01:11:25,427
Now what's happening here?

651
01:11:27,388 --> 01:11:28,555
War's happening.

652
01:11:37,981 --> 01:11:40,859
16 may

653
01:11:48,075 --> 01:11:53,121
No! Fuck! Oh fuck! Doc!

654
01:11:53,204 --> 01:11:57,041
On my way! On my way!
- Oh, Oh fuck!

655
01:12:06,133 --> 01:12:09,679
C'mon kid. Let's go. Up

656
01:12:11,639 --> 01:12:14,892
Move! Move!

657
01:12:50,802 --> 01:12:52,761
It's definatly the vet.

658
01:12:52,886 --> 01:12:54,472
You can't score on the vet.

659
01:12:54,555 --> 01:12:59,977
Oh man, stop fingure fucking dream
with your chichen shit details?

660
01:13:00,018 --> 01:13:02,105
Let me tell you something, Linguilli.

661
01:13:02,188 --> 01:13:07,151
I bombomed mama san and in the garbage dump under
deuce and a half while a girlsan reading a magazine

662
01:13:07,192 --> 01:13:11,113
and sucked on pepsi.
You can score in the vet.

663
01:13:11,196 --> 01:13:13,698
You owe it to yourself.

664
01:13:13,782 --> 01:13:16,660
Hey sarge, do you think they
gotta send us foot powder?

665
01:13:16,701 --> 01:13:19,829
Stop worry about nothing for christ'sake.

666
01:13:19,913 --> 01:13:23,541
Go back to world with bad feet.
What can they do to you, send you to Vietnam?

667
01:13:24,209 --> 01:13:26,836
I'm a salesman. This feet are my life.

668
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:30,381
My godamn skin's peeled off.

669
01:13:31,007 --> 01:13:34,969
My socks tend to shrink.

670
01:13:36,553 --> 01:13:37,972
It's from my girlfriend.

671
01:13:41,726 --> 01:13:45,771
She said she's not gonna write any more.

672
01:13:48,399 --> 01:13:51,277
Friends at college told her it's immoral.

673
01:13:52,277 --> 01:13:53,861
To write to me.

674
01:14:39,573 --> 01:14:42,867
17 may

675
01:14:59,091 --> 01:15:01,635
Medic Doc! Get your
goddam medic up here.

676
01:15:04,971 --> 01:15:10,686
Help! C'mon up! Fuckin' exhausted!

677
01:15:18,651 --> 01:15:20,112
Get a medic up here!

678
01:15:26,534 --> 01:15:28,703
C'mon Let's go!

679
01:15:34,833 --> 01:15:36,669
C'mon guys let's go

680
01:15:36,752 --> 01:15:38,462
and break this fucking hill!

681
01:15:49,348 --> 01:15:51,099
Okay, let's get ready,
let's take this squad.

682
01:15:51,140 --> 01:15:53,560
Teddy Ford. May 17.

683
01:15:57,313 --> 01:15:59,650
How long have you been
on this hill, soldier?

684
01:16:01,776 --> 01:16:02,777
What?

685
01:16:04,487 --> 01:16:07,615
Hey brother, how many times have you
been up and down this hill?

686
01:16:08,158 --> 01:16:09,367
What are you doing here?

687
01:16:09,409 --> 01:16:09,826
It's my job.

688
01:16:09,910 --> 01:16:11,118
Bullshit.

689
01:16:11,702 --> 01:16:15,497
We've been up and down
this hill... nine fucking times.

690
01:16:15,539 --> 01:16:18,334
Hey, word down at Division is
you guys can't take this hill.

691
01:16:18,375 --> 01:16:22,713
What do you have to say about that?
In fact, Senator Kennedy says

692
01:16:22,838 --> 01:16:24,881
you guys don't have a chance at all.

693
01:16:27,551 --> 01:16:29,970
You really like this shit, don't you?

694
01:16:30,928 --> 01:16:33,390
It's your job. A story.

695
01:16:33,473 --> 01:16:37,810
You're waiting here like a fucking vulture.
Watching for somebody to die, so you can take a picture.

696
01:16:37,895 --> 01:16:38,520
It's my job.

697
01:16:38,603 --> 01:16:41,189
I've got more respect for those little bastards up there.
At least they take a side.

698
01:16:41,898 --> 01:16:45,109
You just take pictures. You probably
don't even do your own fucking.

699
01:16:45,944 --> 01:16:47,028
No one ask my AO.

700
01:16:47,111 --> 01:16:47,946
What?

701
01:16:48,029 --> 01:16:49,531
You listen to me.

702
01:16:51,281 --> 01:16:53,867
We're gonna take this
fucking hill, Newsman.

703
01:16:54,702 --> 01:16:58,206
I see you on the top taking
pictures of any of my people

704
01:16:58,248 --> 01:17:00,832
I will blow your fucking head off.

705
01:17:01,791 --> 01:17:04,544
Now you haven't earned
the right to be here.

706
01:17:05,963 --> 01:17:07,547
Do you understand that?

707
01:17:10,258 --> 01:17:11,927
Understand that.

708
01:17:27,775 --> 01:17:29,903
I should have gone to Canada.

709
01:17:29,986 --> 01:17:32,279
All they got is Eskimo's up there,
Beenie.

710
01:17:32,864 --> 01:17:34,949
The smart white people go to college.

711
01:17:35,074 --> 01:17:39,829
Not me. I'm going my two years, getting married.
And forgetting all about this shit.

712
01:17:39,953 --> 01:17:40,662
Never happened.

713
01:17:42,790 --> 01:17:44,583
You people must be aware...

714
01:17:44,667 --> 01:17:50,004
that the brothers... are here. Because
they cannot afford an education.

715
01:17:51,756 --> 01:17:52,966
What am I doing?

716
01:17:53,008 --> 01:17:58,013
Sitting in some... fucking country club sipping
on seven and sevens... and eating a steak.

717
01:17:59,306 --> 01:18:02,141
Take a look around I see
all kinds of white faces here.

718
01:18:03,226 --> 01:18:07,689
Okay. The war Started for you...

719
01:18:08,648 --> 01:18:10,232
when you farted...

720
01:18:10,816 --> 01:18:14,028
and said good morning Vietnam.

721
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:17,698
See now I was born into this shit.

722
01:18:17,782 --> 01:18:21,201
And they pulled the gold fucking spoon..
out of mouth so I could come here.

723
01:18:21,285 --> 01:18:24,789
And see how you low Class
eleven boos live. Is that it?

724
01:18:53,983 --> 01:18:56,152
Brother Blood.

725
01:19:04,159 --> 01:19:05,703
Hey, how'd you get here, Sarge?

726
01:19:05,786 --> 01:19:09,122
Oh, the Sarge... the Sarge
volunteered for this shit.

727
01:19:10,748 --> 01:19:12,000
No, man.

728
01:19:12,042 --> 01:19:16,881
I was drafted, sworn in... and had
my haircut before I was sober.

729
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:20,341
The only reason I went
airborne is Collins.

730
01:19:20,549 --> 01:19:21,760
Who the fuck is Collins?

731
01:19:24,846 --> 01:19:27,516
We volunteered for the reality of it.

732
01:19:32,270 --> 01:19:35,648
Don't you think I chased woman and good time... before
I got into the green machine.

733
01:19:41,403 --> 01:19:48,160
We got our orders from the big puddle.
Collins says... he's not going.

734
01:19:48,202 --> 01:19:50,496
And this one strac.
- You got to respect that.

735
01:19:52,288 --> 01:19:53,790
No way.

736
01:19:53,874 --> 01:19:57,294
If you don't want to pull
on the little people. No sweat.

737
01:19:57,878 --> 01:20:04,676
Don't use your weapon. All I want from anybody is...
to get their ass in the grass with the rest of us.

738
01:20:05,928 --> 01:20:09,596
You don't have to like it.
But you have to show up.

739
01:20:15,729 --> 01:20:17,230
No FNG's, no war.

740
01:20:23,611 --> 01:20:24,778
There it is.

741
01:20:33,996 --> 01:20:37,207
18 may

742
01:20:47,258 --> 01:20:48,175
Medic!

743
01:20:48,258 --> 01:20:51,971
Doc... no! Doc!

744
01:21:06,485 --> 01:21:08,612
Hey you motherfuckers!

745
01:21:23,418 --> 01:21:25,462
Baletsky! Doc's hit!

746
01:21:26,754 --> 01:21:27,714
No!

747
01:21:27,797 --> 01:21:29,716
Baletsky! Gettim he's hit!

748
01:21:31,968 --> 01:21:34,804
Diggs! Diggs!

749
01:21:36,806 --> 01:21:40,393
Doc, he's dead! he's dead!

750
01:21:40,434 --> 01:21:41,184

751
01:21:41,269 --> 01:21:46,982
Stay with me! Stay with me!
Stay with me!

752
01:21:47,857 --> 01:22:01,955
Gaigin, stay with me,

753
01:22:18,888 --> 01:22:20,014
C'mon on move!

754
01:22:26,563 --> 01:22:27,854
Keep going!

755
01:23:04,807 --> 01:23:06,559
Ain't get up!

756
01:24:32,432 --> 01:24:34,476
All right, let's you straight.

757
01:24:35,937 --> 01:24:37,478
You've got a good one man.

758
01:24:38,897 --> 01:24:40,482
You're going home.

759
01:24:40,566 --> 01:24:42,233
See...

760
01:24:43,318 --> 01:24:44,820
See you at home.

761
01:24:50,325 --> 01:25:00,584
He's all right blood. I don't feel
a thing. I am boo koo doped up.

762
01:25:00,626 --> 01:25:05,298
Now, come on now. You owe
this to yourself, all right?

763
01:25:05,923 --> 01:25:11,929
Black Jack... won't be happy... 'til
he gets all my people... killed.

764
01:25:12,012 --> 01:25:14,557
Hey, how are you going to actman, how are you going to act?
You're going back to the real world.

765
01:25:14,598 --> 01:25:16,308
Going back, Doc.

766
01:25:17,350 --> 01:25:22,606
I'm just what the world needs.
Another nigger with a limp.

767
01:25:22,731 --> 01:25:24,900
Now come on, you stop that shit.

768
01:25:26,067 --> 01:25:28,653
I'm not omitting you, blood.

769
01:25:29,696 --> 01:25:36,076
We're all no good...
dumb niggers on this hill.

770
01:25:36,118 --> 01:25:40,873
Blood. And soul. Types.

771
01:25:43,751 --> 01:25:46,461
But we are going to fool
them this time, aren't we?

772
01:25:46,545 --> 01:25:49,131
Fucking A man. Fucking A.

773
01:25:49,256 --> 01:25:54,095
We've been up that hill... ten times...

774
01:25:54,762 --> 01:25:57,598
and they still don't think we're serious.

775
01:26:00,100 --> 01:26:01,226
Who are we?

776
01:26:01,267 --> 01:26:02,519
Hey Doc, come on.

777
01:26:02,603 --> 01:26:04,145

01:26:16,282 --> 01:26:18,492
Take the hill.

783
01:26:19,035 --> 01:26:23,497
And those bastards back in the world...
can never take that from me.

784
01:26:29,044 --> 01:26:30,671
Hold on man.
