1
00:00:00,456 --> 00:00:01,514
I'm done discussing this.

2
00:00:01,624 --> 00:00:02,613
Well, I'm not done.

3
00:00:02,725 --> 00:00:04,124
Katy found Flicka.

4
00:00:04,227 --> 00:00:05,125
She should decide.

5
00:00:05,228 --> 00:00:06,526
Until you're running
this ranch,

6
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:08,120
I'll make the decisions
around here!

7
00:00:08,232 --> 00:00:10,063
I don't want to run your ranch!

8
00:00:10,167 --> 00:00:11,657
- NELL: Howard!
- No, I'm sick of this place!

9
00:00:11,769 --> 00:00:14,294
You know what,
I've given it a lot of thought,

10
00:00:14,405 --> 00:00:15,303
and guess what?

11
00:00:15,406 --> 00:00:18,376
I'm never gonna be
a rancher. Never.

12
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:21,274
I want to go to college.

13
00:00:21,379 --> 00:00:22,812
(Flicka kicking trailer)

14
00:00:22,914 --> 00:00:24,108
Wh-Why didn't you say anything?

15
00:00:24,215 --> 00:00:27,446
'Cause this is what
you wanted me to do.

16
00:00:28,821 --> 00:00:30,015
Katy wants this ranch.

17
00:00:30,122 --> 00:00:33,250
I don't want
any part of it.

18
00:00:35,795 --> 00:00:37,160
I'm sorry you feel that way.

19
00:00:37,263 --> 00:00:38,457
(kicking frantically)

20
00:00:38,564 --> 00:00:39,497
(snorting)

21
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,626
Norbert... take your horse.

22
00:00:45,105 --> 00:00:46,970
Hope to see you folks
at the fairground.

23
00:00:47,074 --> 00:00:50,339
No! Please! No!

24
00:00:51,779 --> 00:00:53,144
- Please!
- NORBERT: Let's move it.

25
00:00:53,247 --> 00:00:54,145
Gus!

26
00:00:54,248 --> 00:00:56,409
(Flicka snorting and kicking)

27
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:03,190
Flicka!

28
00:01:05,728 --> 00:01:07,320
(neighing frantically)

29
00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:09,124
No!

30
00:01:14,304 --> 00:01:17,296
Stop! Stop!

31
00:01:22,012 --> 00:01:24,345
(singing continues)

32
00:01:32,723 --> 00:01:34,885

<i>KATY:
The stories we hear</i>

35
00:01:44,403 --> 00:01:46,668
<i>about how the West was won
are all lies.</i>

36
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:50,436
<i>The history of the West
was written by the horse.</i>

37
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:53,273
<i>Wherever a settler
left his footprint,</i>

38
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:55,779
<i>there was a hoofprint
beside it.</i>

39
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:59,375
<i>Men came further and further
west to stake their claim</i>

40
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:01,920
<i>in the great
American wilderness.</i>

41
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:07,718
<i>But they encountered a strength
that couldn"t be tamed.</i>

42
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:10,161
<i>Wild horses.</i>

43
00:02:10,265 --> 00:02:11,892
Mustangs.

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,025
<i>The settlers
called them parasites</i>

45
00:02:14,135 --> 00:02:17,434
<i>that would strip the land
and starve their own herds.</i>

46
00:02:19,508 --> 00:02:22,705
<i>They couldn"t domesticate them,
so they destroyed them.</i>

47
00:02:22,812 --> 00:02:26,680
<i>Isolated and hungry,
they were on their way</i>

48
00:02:26,782 --> 00:02:29,273
<i>to disappearing
from the face of the earth.</i>

49
00:02:33,256 --> 00:02:35,986
<i>Sometimes
when the light disappears,</i>

50
00:02:36,093 --> 00:02:38,288
<i>an afterimage remains,</i>

51
00:02:38,395 --> 00:02:40,420
<i>just for a moment.</i>

52
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,159
<i>Mustangs are an afterimage
of the West,</i>

53
00:02:43,267 --> 00:02:47,101
<i>no better than ghosts,
hardly there at all.</i>

54
00:02:47,205 --> 00:02:49,173
<i>No one really wants them,</i>

55
00:02:49,273 --> 00:02:51,400
<i>not ranchers, not city people.</i>

56
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:53,137
<i>That"s their destiny.</i>

57
00:02:53,245 --> 00:02:55,679
<i>Let them disappear
once and for all,</i>

58
00:02:55,781 --> 00:02:57,806
<i>along with all
the other misfits, loners</i>

59
00:02:57,916 --> 00:03:01,374
<i>and relics of a wilderness
no one cares about anymore.</i>

60
00:03:03,622 --> 00:03:06,751
<i>Lucky for us,
a few mustangs survived,</i>

61
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,488
<i>hidden away in the mountains.</i>

62
00:03:09,596 --> 00:03:11,587
<i>We need to protect them,</i>

63
00:03:11,698 --> 00:03:14,462
<i>for they are the hope
for some kind ofliving memory</i>

64
00:03:14,567 --> 00:03:16,934
<i>of what the promise of America
used to be...</i>

65
00:03:18,973 --> 00:03:20,668
<i>and could be again.</i>

66
00:03:30,685 --> 00:03:32,812
Whoa.

67
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:35,116
Don't say anything.

68
00:03:35,223 --> 00:03:36,247
Just get on.

69
00:03:38,161 --> 00:03:39,996
Come on.

70
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:42,757
When the kids were little,
I'd tuck 'em in

71
00:03:42,865 --> 00:03:46,028
and say, "I'll love you
till the mountains tumble down."

72
00:03:46,135 --> 00:03:47,796
Right now, I feel like

73
00:03:47,904 --> 00:03:49,873
they could blow away
at any second.

74
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,707
Before Dad died,

75
00:03:54,812 --> 00:03:57,838
he asked me if I wanted
to sell the ranch and...

76
00:03:57,948 --> 00:04:00,076
take the money.

77
00:04:00,185 --> 00:04:02,449
I said, "Over my dead body.

78
00:04:02,554 --> 00:04:04,988
No way, no how."

79
00:04:05,089 --> 00:04:08,718
I thought that's what
he wanted me to say.

80
00:04:08,827 --> 00:04:13,856
But, no, he... he seemed
almost disappointed.

81
00:04:13,966 --> 00:04:16,696
He... he said he felt
like that he was giving me

82
00:04:16,802 --> 00:04:19,327
something that didn't
make any sense anymore.

83
00:04:19,438 --> 00:04:21,269
Maybe he's right.

84
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:27,244
But then I...
I see these kids,

85
00:04:27,347 --> 00:04:28,780
they're hanging out
in the mall,

86
00:04:28,882 --> 00:04:30,509
they're sullen,
they're lazy.

87
00:04:30,617 --> 00:04:33,781
Got no ambition,
got no dreams.

88
00:04:33,888 --> 00:04:35,719
This is the only
way that I know

89
00:04:35,823 --> 00:04:37,313
how to save our children.

90
00:04:37,425 --> 00:04:39,256
Honey, Howard
doesn't need saving.

91
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,021
He'll be fine
wherever he goes.

92
00:04:41,128 --> 00:04:44,587
But Katy, honey,
we could lose her.

93
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:49,228
She's... smart and she's strong,
but she can't survive out there.

94
00:04:49,338 --> 00:04:51,238
Our daughter lives
in a fantasyland.

95
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,967
So do you.

96
00:04:53,075 --> 00:04:56,273
Look at you, sitting on top
of cowboy mountain

97
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,643
looking down at the world
passing by.

98
00:04:58,748 --> 00:05:01,046
When are you gonna look
at your daughter

99
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,777
and realize that she's you?

100
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:08,790
And that's why
I love her so much.

101
00:05:15,466 --> 00:05:16,957
They want to go
to the rodeo, you know?

102
00:05:17,068 --> 00:05:18,626
She wants to see Flicka.

103
00:05:18,737 --> 00:05:20,329
Yeah.

104
00:05:20,438 --> 00:05:22,702
They expect me to say no.

105
00:05:22,807 --> 00:05:23,774
Yep.

106
00:05:26,077 --> 00:05:28,444
I bet I'd really blow
their minds if I said yes.

107
00:05:31,384 --> 00:05:36,481
Then they'd see how diabolical
I can really be.

108
00:05:36,589 --> 00:05:38,989
You are such a bad boy.

109
00:05:39,091 --> 00:05:40,059
I love it.

110
00:05:42,896 --> 00:05:44,124
Race me back?

111
00:05:44,231 --> 00:05:46,062
Let's go. Come on.

112
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:48,828
Come on, Belle.

113
00:05:48,936 --> 00:05:51,371
- Last one back's naked first.
- (Nell laughs)

114
00:05:51,472 --> 00:05:52,404
Hyah!

115
00:05:52,507 --> 00:05:53,838
(Nell whooping)

116
00:05:53,942 --> 00:05:55,500
I'm gonna win!

117
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:56,975
Yeah, right!

118
00:05:57,078 --> 00:05:58,841
Gotcha!

119
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:02,675
(Nell laughing)

120
00:06:04,286 --> 00:06:05,719
(exhales)

121
00:06:05,821 --> 00:06:07,618
Want to go swimming?

122
00:06:07,723 --> 00:06:09,281
No, thanks.

123
00:06:11,226 --> 00:06:15,163
It's a thousand degrees
in here.

124
00:06:20,103 --> 00:06:21,331
I'm busy.

125
00:06:21,438 --> 00:06:25,603
You really want to go swimming.

126
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:26,938
What's he gonna say?

127
00:06:27,044 --> 00:06:28,602
Well, that's his problem.

128
00:06:28,713 --> 00:06:30,613
I'm gonna go see
if the coast is clear.

129
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,780
Mom!

130
00:06:34,886 --> 00:06:36,854
Nobody's home.

131
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:39,488
Let's go.

132
00:06:39,591 --> 00:06:40,785
Are you sure about this?

133
00:06:40,892 --> 00:06:42,519
Hey, we'll be back
before anybody even knows.

134
00:06:42,627 --> 00:06:43,525
Come on.

135
00:06:43,628 --> 00:06:44,526
I'm hot.
Are you hot?

136
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:45,527
Oh, yeah.

137
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:46,495
Oh, yeah!

138
00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:49,932

KATY:
Miranda?

140
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,232
Close your eyes, cowgirl!

141
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:06,151
(yelling and laughing)

142
00:07:13,361 --> 00:07:14,988
(ends)

143
00:07:15,096 --> 00:07:17,064
KATY:
What's going on?

144
00:07:17,165 --> 00:07:19,191
Well, somebody tell me.

145
00:07:19,301 --> 00:07:21,599
Miranda saw Flicka.

146
00:07:21,704 --> 00:07:23,695
Where?

147
00:07:23,806 --> 00:07:27,333
At the fairgrounds when I
was practicing the course.

148
00:07:27,443 --> 00:07:28,671
How did she look?

149
00:07:31,748 --> 00:07:32,646
What?

150
00:07:32,749 --> 00:07:34,512
I've never, ever

151
00:07:34,618 --> 00:07:37,781
been scared around horses,
not in my entire life,

152
00:07:37,888 --> 00:07:40,220
but those horses
that she was with...

153
00:07:40,323 --> 00:07:42,383
What?
Don't stop. Tell me.

154
00:07:44,495 --> 00:07:48,829
You'd really have to work hard
to make horses that angry.

155
00:07:49,967 --> 00:07:52,493
HOWARD:
Listen, I'm sorry, Katy.

156
00:07:52,604 --> 00:07:54,765
I just thought
you'd want to hear.

157
00:07:54,873 --> 00:07:57,933
MI RANDA:
The cowboys in that race are crazy.

158
00:07:58,043 --> 00:08:01,342
But they say the purse
is over $8,000.

159
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:03,780
HOWARD:
Oh, money's no good if you're dead.

160
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:06,408
(gasps):
I can win that race.

161
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:10,148
My demented sister is even
more demented than I thought.

162
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:12,656
Riders get to choose
their horses, right?

163
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:13,657
MI RANDA:
Yeah.

164
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,285
I choose Flicka, I win.

165
00:08:15,396 --> 00:08:16,988
If you can stay on her.

166
00:08:17,098 --> 00:08:17,928
I can.

167
00:08:18,032 --> 00:08:19,158
You're too young to enter.

168
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:21,461
You're not.

169
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:22,467
Bad idea.

170
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:23,662
Brilliant idea.

171
00:08:23,771 --> 00:08:26,070
If I buy Flicka back
with the prize money,

172
00:08:26,174 --> 00:08:28,904
she won't be Dad's horse anymore,
she'll be mine.

173
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:31,843
And if she wins,
someone'll want her foal.

174
00:08:31,947 --> 00:08:34,142
That's money in my pocket.

175
00:08:34,249 --> 00:08:36,547
And if he tries to sell
our land, I'll buy that, too.

176
00:08:36,651 --> 00:08:39,587
Whoa, whoa, Katy, she is
way too dangerous to ride.

177
00:08:39,689 --> 00:08:42,157
Maybe for you
but not for me.

178
00:08:42,258 --> 00:08:44,886
I only have to stay on her
for a few seconds.

179
00:08:44,994 --> 00:08:46,427
I've already done that.

180
00:08:48,932 --> 00:08:50,559
Miranda?

181
00:08:56,306 --> 00:08:57,204
Oh...

182
00:08:57,307 --> 00:08:58,274
(laughs)

183
00:08:59,477 --> 00:09:00,774
The people have spoken.

184
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:03,404
No, the inmates have
taken over the asylum.

185
00:09:03,515 --> 00:09:07,110
Come on, let's see you
walk it like you talk it.

186
00:09:07,218 --> 00:09:08,776
Drown me, please.

187
00:09:08,887 --> 00:09:09,785
Hey! Hey!

188
00:09:09,888 --> 00:09:10,856
Whoa! Whoa!

189
00:09:12,525 --> 00:09:14,220
(girls laughing)

190
00:09:18,731 --> 00:09:22,190
Oof! That aftershave'll
scare the livestock.

191
00:09:22,302 --> 00:09:26,295
Oh. But the ladies
find it reassuring.

192
00:09:26,406 --> 00:09:28,806
Yeah, it let's 'em know
I'm sensitive,

193
00:09:28,909 --> 00:09:32,276
not just a... sexy beast.

194
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,904
(both laugh)

195
00:09:34,015 --> 00:09:35,812
Can we get going?

196
00:09:35,917 --> 00:09:36,849
(sniffs)

197
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,111
Oh, Jack, you stink.

198
00:09:38,219 --> 00:09:39,117
Busted.

199
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,017
Let's go! Come on!

200
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,020
HOWARD:
I'm coming!

201
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,249
(engine starts)

202
00:09:55,905 --> 00:09:58,635
Well, what'll it be
tonight, boys,

203
00:09:58,741 --> 00:10:00,038
crazy eights or canasta?

204
00:10:00,143 --> 00:10:02,043
(barks twice)

205
00:10:02,145 --> 00:10:03,442
Canasta it is.

206
00:10:03,613 --> 00:10:05,673
MAN (over P.A. System):
Ladies and gentlemen,

207
00:10:05,783 --> 00:10:08,809
welcome
to the Red Gulch Roundup!

208
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:10,784
(crowd cheering)

209
00:10:10,888 --> 00:10:13,015
Now, for those of you
that may be visiting

210
00:10:13,123 --> 00:10:15,057
our beautiful state
for the first time,

211
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:17,253
welcome to Wyoming!

212
00:10:17,362 --> 00:10:18,522
In our grand entry today,

213
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:20,962
our flags are being carried
by Miss Rodeo America

214
00:10:21,066 --> 00:10:24,297
and her lovely assistant.

215
00:10:24,402 --> 00:10:27,565
And all of our beauty
a-horseback.

216
00:10:27,672 --> 00:10:28,799
Now in the center

217
00:10:28,908 --> 00:10:32,036
of the arena is the world
champion trick roper,

218
00:10:32,144 --> 00:10:34,669
Mr. Gene McLaughlin!

219
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:37,613
They say in every cowboy's life,
he gets a...

220
00:10:37,717 --> 00:10:41,779
good horse, a good woman
and a good loop.

221
00:10:41,888 --> 00:10:43,617
All right, folks,
it's rodeo time,

222
00:10:43,724 --> 00:10:46,921
but it seems that Miss Rodeo
America needs my assistance...

223
00:10:47,027 --> 00:10:48,790
Aw, honey, how could you
eat that stuff?

224
00:10:48,895 --> 00:10:51,160
It makes me sweeter.

225
00:10:51,266 --> 00:10:53,666
You're already sweet.

226
00:10:53,768 --> 00:10:54,666
There she is!

227
00:10:54,769 --> 00:10:56,464
ANNOUNCER:
...the barrel race!

228
00:10:56,571 --> 00:10:58,334
All right, ladies, cowgirl up.

229
00:10:58,439 --> 00:10:59,406
Mm, mm, mm.

230
00:11:00,942 --> 00:11:03,741
Introducing our next
barrel racer, Miranda Koop.

231
00:11:03,846 --> 00:11:05,575
(cheering)

232
00:11:05,681 --> 00:11:06,579
Come on, baby!

233
00:11:06,682 --> 00:11:07,740
ANNOUNCER:
Here she comes around

234
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:08,976
the first barrel.

235
00:11:09,084 --> 00:11:10,108
Quick.

236
00:11:11,153 --> 00:11:12,314
Another great run.

237
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:15,789
Coming to the third barrel...

238
00:11:15,892 --> 00:11:17,018
(crowd groans)

239
00:11:17,127 --> 00:11:18,219
Out she goes.

240
00:11:18,328 --> 00:11:20,463
That's okay.

241
00:11:20,463 --> 00:11:23,365
That's okay.

242
00:11:23,467 --> 00:11:24,866
(country music plays)

243
00:11:24,969 --> 00:11:28,336
(man singing country)

244
00:12:12,721 --> 00:12:14,518
Hyah, hyah!

245
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:38,643
(singing continues)

246
00:12:46,357 --> 00:12:48,985
She's mine, boys.

247
00:12:57,536 --> 00:12:58,434
(squeals)

248
00:12:58,537 --> 00:13:00,232
(laughing)

249
00:13:04,444 --> 00:13:06,002
(ends)

250
00:13:06,112 --> 00:13:07,306
(cheering)

251
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,621
(slow country song begins)

252
00:13:20,227 --> 00:13:23,162
(man singing)

253
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:01,897
Katy, I'm scared.

254
00:14:02,006 --> 00:14:03,564
I'm not, not even a little.

255
00:14:07,412 --> 00:14:08,640
What do you think?

256
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:12,145
I think I should be
the voice of reason.

257
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:14,412
We're runnin' out of time.

258
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:18,915
Hold on.

259
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:26,728
(distant music and cheering)

260
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:31,865
You need gum.

261
00:14:31,972 --> 00:14:33,565
Yeah, okay.

262
00:14:43,385 --> 00:14:46,684
(indistinct voices)

263
00:14:46,788 --> 00:14:48,915
(country music playing)

264
00:14:51,827 --> 00:14:53,852
Wait here.

265
00:14:53,962 --> 00:14:55,726
Here's your receipt.
Good luck to you, partner.

266
00:14:55,832 --> 00:14:57,197
- Thank you, sir.
- You bet.

267
00:14:59,235 --> 00:15:00,361
How you doing, Norbert?

268
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:01,698
Oh, what you say, Wagner?

269
00:15:01,804 --> 00:15:03,294
- Hey, sweetheart.
- Hiya, Norbert.

270
00:15:03,406 --> 00:15:05,841
Can I help you?

271
00:15:05,943 --> 00:15:08,935
Yeah, uh,
I want to register.

272
00:15:09,046 --> 00:15:10,638
For an event.
(chuckles)

273
00:15:10,748 --> 00:15:13,046
You gonna tell me which one,
or do I have to read your mind?

274
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:15,209
The wild horse race.

275
00:15:15,319 --> 00:15:17,254
Wild horse race.

276
00:15:17,355 --> 00:15:19,220
That takes a team of two.

277
00:15:19,324 --> 00:15:21,417
Mm-hmm.
That's my partner.

278
00:15:21,526 --> 00:15:23,687
Outside.

279
00:15:23,795 --> 00:15:26,355
That little bitty feller?

280
00:15:26,464 --> 00:15:27,955
(chuckles)

281
00:15:28,067 --> 00:15:29,534
Good luck.

282
00:15:29,635 --> 00:15:30,693
I need $50.

283
00:15:30,803 --> 00:15:33,431
Yes, sir.

284
00:15:36,275 --> 00:15:37,469
Fifty.

285
00:15:37,577 --> 00:15:40,570
Gotta sign this waiver.

286
00:15:40,681 --> 00:15:42,774
Right there.

287
00:15:42,883 --> 00:15:44,646
Report to the corral.

288
00:15:44,751 --> 00:15:46,742
Pick yourself out a hoss.

289
00:15:46,853 --> 00:15:48,184
- WOMAN: Here you are, darling.
- Thank you.

290
00:15:48,288 --> 00:15:50,314
The event rolls at 5:00 p.m. Sharp.
Here's your receipt.

291
00:15:50,425 --> 00:15:51,585
Thank you.

292
00:15:51,693 --> 00:15:54,628
And if you come to your senses
and want to back out...

293
00:15:54,729 --> 00:15:57,061
you lose every penny.

294
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:58,689
(chuckles)

295
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,233
Good luck.

296
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:03,931
(horses whinnying)

297
00:16:12,482 --> 00:16:16,043
(neighing)

298
00:16:16,152 --> 00:16:17,483
(gasps)

299
00:16:17,587 --> 00:16:18,815
It's okay, Flicka.

300
00:16:18,922 --> 00:16:20,219
MAN:
Doggone, Billy!

301
00:16:20,323 --> 00:16:22,689
Hey, get outta there,
you lunatic!

302
00:16:22,792 --> 00:16:25,353
You choose your horse
like everybody else,

303
00:16:25,463 --> 00:16:27,158
or you can take a hike!

304
00:16:27,264 --> 00:16:29,755
Do the rules say you can put
a baby cradle on a horse?

305
00:16:29,867 --> 00:16:31,528
- (laughing)
- Quiet down!

306
00:16:31,636 --> 00:16:32,864
All right, gather 'round, boys.

307
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:33,937
Shout 'em out.

308
00:16:34,038 --> 00:16:35,700
(overlapping shouts)

309
00:16:35,807 --> 00:16:37,741
Fourth team takes
the black filly.

310
00:16:37,843 --> 00:16:40,141
Son, you just lost a race.

311
00:16:40,245 --> 00:16:42,907
That horse is truly loco.

312
00:16:43,015 --> 00:16:44,778
Boys, next time
you see your horse,

313
00:16:44,883 --> 00:16:47,250
it'll be in the ring,
trying to run you over.

314
00:16:47,353 --> 00:16:48,445
MAN:
All right, now.

315
00:16:48,554 --> 00:16:49,543
Good luck!

316
00:16:49,656 --> 00:16:53,456
(neighing)

317
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:55,857
Ladies and gentlemen,
and cowboys...

318
00:16:55,962 --> 00:16:58,397
the wild horse race
is about to start.

319
00:16:58,499 --> 00:17:00,296
Now, if you've got
a weak heart...

320
00:17:00,401 --> 00:17:01,390
Hey!

321
00:17:01,502 --> 00:17:02,833
- Kick some cowboy ass.
- Thanks.

322
00:17:02,936 --> 00:17:05,166
...or you just ate
a big meal, I suggest you...

323
00:17:05,272 --> 00:17:08,436
Don't you dare get hurt.

324
00:17:08,543 --> 00:17:10,238
Dang! Norbert.

325
00:17:10,345 --> 00:17:13,041
You know what we say to our
first group of riders...

326
00:17:13,148 --> 00:17:14,979
welcome to our...

327
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:16,277
Do you think he
recognized us?

328
00:17:16,384 --> 00:17:18,318
- I don't know.
- ANNOUNCER: Let's bring 'em in!

329
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,547
Come on.

330
00:17:19,655 --> 00:17:21,555
Now, direct your attention
to the chutes.

331
00:17:21,657 --> 00:17:24,285
That ain't no earthquake
beneath your feet.

332
00:17:24,393 --> 00:17:26,418
That's wild horses
coming at you.

333
00:17:26,529 --> 00:17:29,589
Look at those crazy devils.

334
00:17:29,699 --> 00:17:31,463
They've never been saddled,
never haltered.

335
00:17:31,568 --> 00:17:35,231
Angrier than a cowboy
who just totaled his pickup.

336
00:17:35,338 --> 00:17:36,236
Here's how it works.

337
00:17:36,339 --> 00:17:37,397
In a few moments the horses...

338
00:17:37,507 --> 00:17:38,701
- No way.
- What?

339
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:40,140
Are you freaking crazy?!

340
00:17:40,243 --> 00:17:41,643
Just try and stop me.

341
00:17:41,746 --> 00:17:43,441
...the boys have gotta grab
'em, saddle 'em,

342
00:17:43,548 --> 00:17:45,072
then ride 'em
between a pair of barrels,

343
00:17:45,183 --> 00:17:46,844
and any rider
that stays on that long...

344
00:17:46,951 --> 00:17:48,418
Your group's up next.

345
00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:49,986
...wins $8,000.

346
00:17:50,088 --> 00:17:52,990
- I'm giving my number back.
- Go ahead.

347
00:17:53,092 --> 00:17:54,116
So, let's bring in
the first set of victims.

348
00:17:54,226 --> 00:17:55,818
(chuckling):
I mean, cowboys.

349
00:17:55,928 --> 00:17:58,829
Team number one, this is

350
00:17:58,997 --> 00:18:01,693
Jimmy Miles and John Bull.

351
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,826
Team number two, the Eggan boys.

352
00:18:03,937 --> 00:18:06,770
Second generation,
Wade and Trace Eggan.

353
00:18:06,873 --> 00:18:09,808
Team number three- Chris Fadey
and Big John Slim.

354
00:18:09,909 --> 00:18:13,709
And this next team of kids,
they are so green,

355
00:18:13,813 --> 00:18:17,944
they've got moss
oozing out of their pores...

356
00:18:18,052 --> 00:18:19,883
- Hi, Norbert. How are you?
- Well, well, well.

357
00:18:19,987 --> 00:18:21,215
Hi, how are you?

358
00:18:21,322 --> 00:18:23,483
Guess you changed your mind
about mustangs, didn't you?

359
00:18:23,591 --> 00:18:24,649
- (chuckles)
- Come again?

360
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:25,988
Well, you're here
to see your boy

361
00:18:26,094 --> 00:18:27,322
ride that wild horse,
aren't you?

362
00:18:27,429 --> 00:18:28,396
- My boy?
- Howard?

363
00:18:28,497 --> 00:18:29,395
Yeah.

364
00:18:29,498 --> 00:18:30,487
What are you
talking about?

365
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:31,930
Well, he's up now.

366
00:18:32,033 --> 00:18:33,432
Where is he?
I'm gonna kill him.

367
00:18:33,535 --> 00:18:35,332
- NORBERT: Follow me.
- Where's Miranda?

368
00:18:35,437 --> 00:18:36,369
I don't believe this.

369
00:18:36,472 --> 00:18:38,303
ANNOUNCER:
...the first four teams...

370
00:18:38,407 --> 00:18:39,806
MAN:
Riders, get ready.

371
00:18:39,909 --> 00:18:41,137
HOWARD:
Here we go.

372
00:18:41,244 --> 00:18:43,974
Don't let anybody back out,
boys. Your life's on the line.

373
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,173
Let's go for it.

374
00:18:46,282 --> 00:18:47,408
Ten...

375
00:18:47,518 --> 00:18:48,678
(crowd joining in):
Nine...

376
00:18:48,786 --> 00:18:49,753
eight...

377
00:18:49,853 --> 00:18:50,820
seven...

378
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:52,013
six...

379
00:18:52,122 --> 00:18:54,056
five... four...

380
00:18:54,158 --> 00:18:55,489
three...

381
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:56,524
two...

382
00:18:56,627 --> 00:18:57,559
one...

383
00:18:57,661 --> 00:19:00,062
ANNOUNCER:
Aw, let her rip, boys!

384
00:19:00,165 --> 00:19:02,190
Get back, Loretta.
Here they come.

385
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,632
Four of the toughest broncs
you're ever gonna see.

386
00:19:04,736 --> 00:19:06,567
Remember,
one man's gonna give chase;

387
00:19:06,671 --> 00:19:08,002
one's gonna try
to get him saddled.

388
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:11,008
You see this black filly,
number 14-

389
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,873
she is out of control.

390
00:19:12,978 --> 00:19:14,275
- Get her! Get her!
- Whoa!

391
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:17,543
That's a bad old girl to have
to deal with in this dance.

392
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:20,016
Them boys got more
than they bargained for,

393
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:21,712
taking that horse.

394
00:19:23,557 --> 00:19:25,115
Now this is the height
of insanity-

395
00:19:25,225 --> 00:19:26,658
we've got a man on right here.

396
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,058
Almost on.

397
00:19:29,162 --> 00:19:30,629
(groans)

398
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:32,528
Oh, my Lord, my mother
could've rode better than that.

399
00:19:32,633 --> 00:19:35,033
Two riders up,
one still unsaddled.

400
00:19:35,136 --> 00:19:37,900
- Heads up, boys!
- (man grunting)

401
00:19:38,005 --> 00:19:41,406
Oh, that is not the recommended
way to dismount a wild horse.

402
00:19:41,509 --> 00:19:43,068
NELL:
This is insane.

403
00:19:43,178 --> 00:19:45,442
ANNOUNCER:
There it is, on the far side.

404
00:19:45,547 --> 00:19:48,607
Take a chance,
put your life on the line.

405
00:19:48,717 --> 00:19:51,948
Dropped him like a two-ton rock,
split him like a $2 suitcase.

406
00:19:52,054 --> 00:19:55,183
He's wide open,
and he is all done.

407
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:56,758
Flicka!

408
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:59,226
Boy, I hope one of these guys
wins this thing...

409
00:19:59,329 --> 00:20:00,261
(snorts)

410
00:20:00,363 --> 00:20:02,422
(announcer's voice fades)

411
00:20:02,532 --> 00:20:04,193
Easy, girl.

412
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,928
(whispers):
Hey.

413
00:20:06,036 --> 00:20:07,628
(announcer continuing
indistinctly)

414
00:20:07,738 --> 00:20:08,966
I see Howard.

415
00:20:09,073 --> 00:20:10,097
(panting)

416
00:20:10,207 --> 00:20:12,573
ANNOUNCER:
...the last time we see...

417
00:20:12,676 --> 00:20:13,802
(sighs)

418
00:20:15,813 --> 00:20:17,145
It's Katy.

419
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:18,580
Oh, my God.

420
00:20:18,683 --> 00:20:19,581
Rob! Rob!

421
00:20:19,684 --> 00:20:20,810
ANNOUNCER:
Lookee here!

422
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:23,387
Some lunatic just jumped
out of the VI P section.

423
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:24,546
He's here.

424
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:26,487
What's he doing
in the middle of the arena?!

425
00:20:26,591 --> 00:20:28,253
- Look!
- I'm an idiot.

426
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:29,726
He's never gonna
let me keep her.

427
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:31,854
- Just win.
- It won't make any difference to him.

428
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:33,955
- He doesn't want either of us.
- Let go!

429
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,432
ANNOUNCER:
Look at that crazy fool, this guy is still at it.

430
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:39,334
Where is he going?!
What's going on?

431
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:40,701
Katy, let go.

432
00:20:40,807 --> 00:20:42,001
Ya... come on.

433
00:20:42,109 --> 00:20:43,770
Look a-here,
jumped on bareback.

434
00:20:43,877 --> 00:20:46,368
What in the world is going on?

435
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,573
I'm gonna set you free, girl.
Hyah!

436
00:20:48,682 --> 00:20:51,243
Ladies and gentlemen, number 14...
is gonna be the winner.

437
00:20:51,352 --> 00:20:52,250
ROB:
Katy!

438
00:20:52,353 --> 00:20:53,820
14, folks,

439
00:20:53,922 --> 00:20:56,516
is not stopping at the barrels.

440
00:20:56,624 --> 00:20:59,650
I've never seen anything
like this in my life.

441
00:20:59,761 --> 00:21:02,322
I've been watching this
for 40 years.

442
00:21:02,431 --> 00:21:04,922
So, call the state troopers
in Wyoming.

443
00:21:05,034 --> 00:21:06,626
He's headed for Cheyenne.

444
00:21:06,735 --> 00:21:09,602
I don't think he can stop
that black filly.

445
00:21:35,701 --> 00:21:37,328
(thunder rumbles)

446
00:21:42,374 --> 00:21:44,501
(sobbing gently)

447
00:21:47,046 --> 00:21:50,345
I don't know what to do.

448
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:53,613
Where do we go, Flicka?

449
00:21:57,624 --> 00:21:59,592
- Nothing you can do.
- (garbled radio transmission)

450
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,285
NELL:
What'd they say?

451
00:22:01,395 --> 00:22:03,420
Can't get a helicopter
here till morning.

452
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:04,724
Boys lost the trail.

453
00:22:04,832 --> 00:22:07,700
Probably won't be able to pick
it up again till daylight.

454
00:22:07,802 --> 00:22:09,702
- Norbert, gimme a horse.
- Two horses.

455
00:22:09,804 --> 00:22:11,066
Y'all need to calm down.

456
00:22:11,172 --> 00:22:14,164
No, we're not gonna calm down
till we find our daughter.

457
00:22:14,275 --> 00:22:15,333
She'll go home.

458
00:22:15,443 --> 00:22:16,375
No, honey, she can't.

459
00:22:16,478 --> 00:22:18,207
Not in the mountains,
not in the dark.

460
00:22:18,313 --> 00:22:19,781
Not Katy- Flicka.

461
00:22:19,882 --> 00:22:22,680
Hey, our mountains
are her home, too.

462
00:22:22,785 --> 00:22:24,719
You're right.
Let's go.

463
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:27,311
When we get back to the ranch,
we're riding out.

464
00:22:27,423 --> 00:22:29,482
Weather's coming in.

465
00:22:44,242 --> 00:22:46,608
(thunder rumbling)

466
00:22:46,711 --> 00:22:48,372
(Flicka huffs)

467
00:22:48,479 --> 00:22:50,447
This is our creek, isn't it?

468
00:22:50,548 --> 00:22:52,483
You brought us back.

469
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,185
(relieved sigh)

470
00:22:56,288 --> 00:22:57,949
Thank you, girl.

471
00:22:58,057 --> 00:23:00,685
Let's go home.
Come on.

472
00:23:22,283 --> 00:23:24,911
What is it?

473
00:23:25,019 --> 00:23:27,648
What is it, girl?

474
00:23:32,794 --> 00:23:34,625
(snorts)

475
00:23:34,729 --> 00:23:38,097
What is it, girl? Huh?

476
00:23:38,201 --> 00:23:40,533
(neighing)

477
00:23:40,636 --> 00:23:42,365
It's okay, girl.

478
00:23:42,472 --> 00:23:43,530
It's okay.

479
00:23:43,639 --> 00:23:45,197
It's okay, girl.

480
00:23:45,308 --> 00:23:46,605
Come on.

481
00:23:46,709 --> 00:23:48,177
Come on, it's okay.

482
00:23:48,278 --> 00:23:50,678
- (neighing)
- (yells)

483
00:23:50,781 --> 00:23:52,146
(snarling)

484
00:23:52,249 --> 00:23:53,477
(gasps)

485
00:23:53,584 --> 00:23:56,553
(snarling)

486
00:23:56,653 --> 00:23:57,176
No!

487
00:23:57,287 --> 00:23:58,778
(neighing)

488
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:00,881
No!

489
00:24:00,992 --> 00:24:02,721
- (snarling)
- (neighing)

490
00:24:02,827 --> 00:24:04,954
Get away from her!

491
00:24:05,063 --> 00:24:07,031
No!

492
00:24:12,671 --> 00:24:14,434
(sobbing):
Flicka!

493
00:24:17,343 --> 00:24:19,834
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

494
00:24:19,945 --> 00:24:21,106
(sobbing)

495
00:24:21,214 --> 00:24:23,478
God! Get up.

496
00:24:23,583 --> 00:24:25,244
Oh, God.

497
00:24:25,352 --> 00:24:27,081
Oh, my God.

498
00:24:27,187 --> 00:24:29,781
Flicka, get up, please.

499
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:31,517
Get up!

500
00:24:33,794 --> 00:24:36,786
Somebody help me!

501
00:24:36,898 --> 00:24:38,923
(sobbing)

502
00:24:42,905 --> 00:24:44,634
Get up!

503
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:47,607
Get up, please!

504
00:24:50,546 --> 00:24:52,013
- Hyah! Hyah!
- Let's go.

505
00:24:52,114 --> 00:24:54,083
- Hyah! Hyah!
- Hyah! Hyah!

506
00:24:54,184 --> 00:24:55,378
Hyah!

507
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:59,614
(thunder rumbling)

508
00:24:59,722 --> 00:25:01,349
JACK:
I'll search the ridge.

509
00:25:01,457 --> 00:25:03,823
GUS:
I'll take the south meadow. Katy!

510
00:25:03,927 --> 00:25:05,793
ROB:
I'm gonna check the creek.

511
00:25:05,896 --> 00:25:07,659
You should go back.

512
00:25:07,765 --> 00:25:08,993
Not a chance.

513
00:25:09,099 --> 00:25:11,124
Katy!

514
00:25:11,235 --> 00:25:12,827
Katy!

515
00:25:12,937 --> 00:25:15,030
Katy!

516
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:26,883
Katy!

517
00:25:29,789 --> 00:25:30,915
Aah...

518
00:25:31,023 --> 00:25:32,513
Oh!

519
00:25:32,625 --> 00:25:34,092
(grunts):
Katy?

520
00:25:34,193 --> 00:25:35,217
Oh, baby.

521
00:25:35,328 --> 00:25:36,488
It's gonna be okay, baby.

522
00:25:36,596 --> 00:25:39,327
Daddy's got you.
Come on.

523
00:25:39,433 --> 00:25:42,994
Dad... the lion got her.

524
00:25:46,406 --> 00:25:48,374
You're gonna be all right, baby.

525
00:25:48,475 --> 00:25:50,307
(whispers):
It's all right.

526
00:25:54,849 --> 00:25:56,908
(huffs quietly)

527
00:25:59,988 --> 00:26:02,389
Flicka.

528
00:26:02,491 --> 00:26:04,459
(crying)

529
00:26:17,474 --> 00:26:18,634
Is she all right?

530
00:26:18,742 --> 00:26:19,868
(shuddering)

531
00:26:19,976 --> 00:26:22,035
Find Jack.
Go to the creek.

532
00:26:22,145 --> 00:26:24,580
That horse is hurt bad.

533
00:26:24,682 --> 00:26:27,617
<i>NELL:
A hundred and two.</i>

534
00:26:27,718 --> 00:26:30,551
I don't know if it's accurate.
It's an old thermometer.

535
00:26:30,655 --> 00:26:32,782
No.

536
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:35,086
The doctor can't land
in the storm.

537
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:39,727
So... no.
So, we'll wait.

538
00:26:43,502 --> 00:26:45,596
(sniffles):
Okay.

539
00:26:45,705 --> 00:26:47,172
What do I look for?

540
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:49,503
A hundred and five.

541
00:26:49,609 --> 00:26:51,736
Can that be right?

542
00:26:51,844 --> 00:26:54,540
Howard, get some more ice, son.

543
00:26:58,686 --> 00:27:00,916
Flicka!

544
00:27:05,459 --> 00:27:07,451
(neighing)

545
00:27:07,562 --> 00:27:11,521
(singing lullaby)

546
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:17,467
(neighing)

547
00:27:17,572 --> 00:27:20,041
(singing continues)

548
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:24,876
(snarling and neighing)

549
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:27,414
(ends)

550
00:27:28,884 --> 00:27:31,979
Flicka!

551
00:27:41,566 --> 00:27:44,967
What's Katy's shirt
doing around her neck?

552
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:49,068
She tried to stop
the bleeding.

553
00:27:49,173 --> 00:27:52,268
Oh, she's cut deep.

554
00:27:52,378 --> 00:27:54,869
We ought to take
away her pain.

555
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,777
(thunder rumbles)

556
00:27:56,882 --> 00:27:59,442
You gonna shoot her?

557
00:27:59,551 --> 00:28:02,111
What do you think?

558
00:28:12,766 --> 00:28:15,292
How bad's the horse?

559
00:28:17,405 --> 00:28:18,463
(thunder rumbles)

560
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:19,869
(sighs)

561
00:28:19,974 --> 00:28:22,465
Go back and put her down.

562
00:28:26,381 --> 00:28:28,178
She'll hear the shot.

563
00:28:28,283 --> 00:28:29,648
She'll think it's thunder.

564
00:28:29,751 --> 00:28:31,378
No, she won't.

565
00:28:31,486 --> 00:28:33,886
Look, Katy's smart.

566
00:28:33,989 --> 00:28:36,151
She sees things...

567
00:28:36,259 --> 00:28:39,524
little details
most people ignore...

568
00:28:39,629 --> 00:28:42,097
the ones that make
a difference.

569
00:28:42,198 --> 00:28:44,063
She'll know it's Flicka.

570
00:28:44,167 --> 00:28:47,000
I can't let that animal suffer.

571
00:28:51,008 --> 00:28:52,999
I'll do it myself.

572
00:28:57,948 --> 00:29:00,076
(thunder crashing)

573
00:29:07,091 --> 00:29:09,788
- Dad?
- Don't.

574
00:29:09,895 --> 00:29:13,126
(voice breaking):
I'm sorry.

575
00:29:13,232 --> 00:29:16,258
I really screwed up.

576
00:29:16,368 --> 00:29:18,836
Look at me.

577
00:29:18,938 --> 00:29:20,166
You're a good man.

578
00:29:20,272 --> 00:29:21,331
Yes, sir.

579
00:29:21,441 --> 00:29:23,102
Now, you stay
with your mother.

580
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:24,700
Yes, sir.

581
00:29:35,656 --> 00:29:38,887
Are you gonna kill Flicka?

582
00:29:38,993 --> 00:29:41,393
I'm just gonna have
a look at her, baby.

583
00:29:41,496 --> 00:29:43,055
(sobbing)

584
00:29:43,165 --> 00:29:46,293
It's okay, Daddy.

585
00:29:46,401 --> 00:29:48,733
You can shoot us.

586
00:29:50,339 --> 00:29:51,306
(whispers):
Katy!

587
00:29:51,406 --> 00:29:53,932
It's okay, baby.
It's okay.

588
00:29:54,043 --> 00:29:56,773
(thunder rumbling)

589
00:30:20,372 --> 00:30:22,135
Damn!

590
00:30:29,282 --> 00:30:32,513
(echoing gunshot)

591
00:30:32,618 --> 00:30:33,642
(murmured gasp)

592
00:30:33,753 --> 00:30:34,947
Flicka!

593
00:30:35,054 --> 00:30:37,989
(panting)

594
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:40,924
Shh!

595
00:30:41,028 --> 00:30:43,087
It's okay.

596
00:30:44,364 --> 00:30:46,229
Dang it.

597
00:30:51,472 --> 00:30:54,168
(rain pattering outside)

598
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,544
(thunder rumbling)

599
00:31:00,649 --> 00:31:02,583
(crickets chirping)

600
00:31:21,171 --> 00:31:23,197
(door bangs)

601
00:31:33,752 --> 00:31:36,050
Oh, dear God.

602
00:31:36,154 --> 00:31:38,122
Oh...

603
00:31:39,992 --> 00:31:42,290
Oh, look at her.

604
00:31:45,665 --> 00:31:47,895
It was a lion.

605
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:56,234
There's no good reason
she's alive.

606
00:31:56,343 --> 00:31:59,904
There's a very good reason
she's alive.

607
00:32:00,014 --> 00:32:02,574
She's got
mustang blood in her.

608
00:32:02,683 --> 00:32:06,084
She's a fighter...

609
00:32:06,186 --> 00:32:09,156
just like our girl.

610
00:32:17,198 --> 00:32:18,598
Don't worry.

611
00:32:18,701 --> 00:32:20,566
The doctors will be
here in the morning.

612
00:32:21,637 --> 00:32:24,970
Let's get her
to the barn.

613
00:32:25,074 --> 00:32:26,803
Come on, sweetie.

614
00:32:26,909 --> 00:32:29,036
Come on, Flicka.

615
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,207
Come on, honey.

616
00:32:44,595 --> 00:32:46,153
(sighs)

617
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:48,824
The day you were born...

618
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:52,997
...and they gave you to me...

619
00:32:55,074 --> 00:32:58,874
...I felt my hands were
too rough to hold you.

620
00:33:00,245 --> 00:33:03,875
And you cried
no matter what we did...

621
00:33:05,752 --> 00:33:08,312
...but your mom said
that that was a good sign.

622
00:33:08,421 --> 00:33:10,389
You were strong.

623
00:33:13,761 --> 00:33:16,662
That wasn't much comfort
when I was holding you

624
00:33:16,764 --> 00:33:21,167
and pacing back and forth
all night.

625
00:33:21,268 --> 00:33:26,138
All you did was look at me
with those big, beautiful eyes.

626
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:31,043
I made all kinds
of promises to you

627
00:33:31,146 --> 00:33:34,013
if you would
just go to sleep.

628
00:33:37,987 --> 00:33:41,218
Katy...

629
00:33:41,324 --> 00:33:45,283
I forgot to keep
those promises...

630
00:33:48,932 --> 00:33:51,400
...and I'm sorry.

631
00:33:55,272 --> 00:33:57,433
Do you forgive me?

632
00:33:57,541 --> 00:34:02,445
I'll tell you every day
how proud I am of you

633
00:34:02,547 --> 00:34:06,176
and how proud I am
that you're my daughter.

634
00:34:08,052 --> 00:34:11,284
Just stay with me...

635
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:13,858
please.

636
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,626
(kisses)

637
00:34:22,736 --> 00:34:24,636
(sniffles)

638
00:34:24,738 --> 00:34:26,638
(sighs)

639
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:29,709
(sniffles)

640
00:34:33,114 --> 00:34:36,083
(sniffles)

641
00:35:02,078 --> 00:35:04,069
(sniffs)

642
00:35:14,124 --> 00:35:16,593
(sniffles)

643
00:35:37,183 --> 00:35:39,152
(sniffles)

644
00:35:46,693 --> 00:35:48,684
(sighs)

645
00:35:48,795 --> 00:35:50,764
(keys clacking)

646
00:36:05,147 --> 00:36:07,138
(birds chirping)

647
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:10,145
(rooster crows)

648
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:18,217
(woman singing alternative country)

649
00:36:22,533 --> 00:36:23,761
Daddy.

650
00:36:28,673 --> 00:36:30,607
Her fever's broke.

651
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:33,908
I want to see Flicka.

652
00:36:34,012 --> 00:36:35,980
NELL:
No, it's okay, sweetheart.

653
00:36:41,887 --> 00:36:44,515
Oh, babe...

654
00:36:46,225 --> 00:36:48,193
(sighs)

655
00:37:02,343 --> 00:37:04,368
Katy, can you come downstairs
for a minute?

656
00:37:13,688 --> 00:37:15,952
(crying)

657
00:37:16,057 --> 00:37:17,889
It's my fault Flicka's dead.

658
00:37:17,994 --> 00:37:20,827
(singing continues)
- I don't think so.

659
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:22,761
Come on outside.

660
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:33,372
(ends)

661
00:37:36,446 --> 00:37:37,970
(gasps)

662
00:37:38,081 --> 00:37:40,049
Flicka!

663
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,350
Baby!

664
00:37:44,455 --> 00:37:47,788
(sighs)

665
00:37:47,892 --> 00:37:48,790
(whinnies softly)

666
00:37:48,893 --> 00:37:51,454
(whispering):
You're alive.

667
00:37:51,563 --> 00:37:53,724
It's going
to be okay now, okay?

668
00:37:53,832 --> 00:37:55,959
(whinnies)

669
00:37:56,068 --> 00:37:57,501
Aw...

670
00:37:57,603 --> 00:38:00,299
Your mother's been taking
good care of her...

671
00:38:00,406 --> 00:38:01,737
but when you're better,

672
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:05,675
I expect you to take
care of her yourself.

673
00:38:05,779 --> 00:38:08,009
But you said if I don't get
back into school...

674
00:38:08,114 --> 00:38:09,843
Yes, that's what I said,
and I meant it.

675
00:38:09,949 --> 00:38:11,849
So Dad sent them your essay.

676
00:38:11,951 --> 00:38:13,852
I told them I didn't know much
about writing,

677
00:38:13,954 --> 00:38:15,717
but I sure as heck
know about the West.

678
00:38:15,823 --> 00:38:17,051
So does my daughter,

679
00:38:17,158 --> 00:38:18,819
and it's right there
in her essay-

680
00:38:18,926 --> 00:38:21,156
every opinionated,

681
00:38:21,262 --> 00:38:23,662
ornery, hot-blooded
part of it.

682
00:38:23,764 --> 00:38:26,825
(Flicka whinnies softly)

683
00:38:26,935 --> 00:38:28,232
What did they say?

684
00:38:28,336 --> 00:38:30,998
What does anyone say
to your father?

685
00:38:31,106 --> 00:38:32,334
BOTH:
"Yes, sir."

686
00:38:32,441 --> 00:38:35,569
(laughing)

687
00:38:35,678 --> 00:38:37,441
I love you, Daddy.

688
00:38:37,547 --> 00:38:39,014
I love you, sweetie.

689
00:38:47,357 --> 00:38:49,222
(neighing)

690
00:38:50,327 --> 00:38:51,851
<i>KATY:
I believe there is a force</i>

691
00:38:51,962 --> 00:38:55,523
<i>in this world that lives
beneath the surface...</i>

692
00:38:55,632 --> 00:38:58,193
<i>something primitive and wild
that awakens</i>

693
00:38:58,303 --> 00:39:01,932
<i>when you need an extra push
just to survive...</i>

694
00:39:03,975 --> 00:39:06,034
<i>...like wildflowers that bloom</i>

695
00:39:06,144 --> 00:39:09,273
<i>after a fire turns
the forest black.</i>

696
00:39:13,319 --> 00:39:15,378
<i>Most people are afraid of it</i>

697
00:39:15,488 --> 00:39:19,322
<i>and keep it buried
deep inside themselves.</i>

698
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:31,930
<i>But there will always be
a few people</i>

699
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:36,601
<i>who have the courage to love
what is untamed inside us.</i>

700
00:39:36,711 --> 00:39:38,269
<i>One of those men...</i>

701
00:39:39,714 --> 00:39:42,513
<i>...is my father.</i>

702
00:39:50,826 --> 00:39:52,760

703
00:39:52,861 --> 00:39:53,988
<i>KATY:
There was once a time</i>

704
00:39:54,097 --> 00:39:58,329
<i>when Americans came west
to discover their destiny.</i>

705
00:40:01,871 --> 00:40:05,239
<i>Today, they seem to move
around every which where,</i>

706
00:40:05,342 --> 00:40:08,106
<i>restless and unsettled...</i>

707
00:40:08,212 --> 00:40:13,912
<i>but I think they"re still
looking for the same thing-</i>

708
00:40:14,018 --> 00:40:17,819
<i>a place where they can be
optimistic about the future,</i>

709
00:40:17,923 --> 00:40:21,359
<i>a place that helps them to be
who they really want to be...</i>

710
00:40:23,461 --> 00:40:26,625
<i>...where they can feel
that this life makes sense...</i>

711
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:31,695
<i>...a place where they can feel</i>

712
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:35,103
<i>what I feel
when I am riding Flicka.</i>

713
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:41,671
<i>"Cause when we"re riding,
all I feel...</i>

714
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:45,781
<i>...is free.</i>
