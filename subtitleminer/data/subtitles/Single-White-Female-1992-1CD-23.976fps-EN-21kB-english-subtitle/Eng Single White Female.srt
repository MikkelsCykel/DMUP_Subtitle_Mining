1
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:29,024
- So how many kids do we want?
- What's the statistical norm?

2
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:31,777
You and your statistics.

3
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:37,574
- 1.2.
- Okay, then I want 2.2.

4
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:43,455
- And I want them to look like you.
- Poor kids.

5
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:51,672
If I can get you off the computer
tomorrow, I'll buy you that ring.

6
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:56,844
- Is this gonna be a real wedding?
- As opposed to a fake one?

7
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,931
Sam, you've already been through
the big ceremony.

8
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:04,810
That was the fake one.
This is the real one.

9
00:03:04,977 --> 00:03:09,898
You can have any kind of wedding
you want. Underwater. In a sauna.

10
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:13,485
Horseback.

11
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:18,198
Naked skydiving?

12
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:25,122
I've not been in New York
long enough to know many people.

13
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:30,544
- Except me.
- Well, you're invited.

14
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:35,257
And my friend Graham upstairs.

15
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:41,430
It won't be long before you know
half the people in New York.

16
00:03:41,597 --> 00:03:47,269
People like you ...
but I found you first.

17
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:54,067
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

18
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:16,590
Hold on a second.

19
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:23,472
- Sam, it's your ex-wife.
- What?

20
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:26,433
It's Lisa.

21
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:37,986
Because ... I'm hanging up now.

22
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:44,701
I'm sorry. She shouldn't call here.

23
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:49,081
It's where you live. She's entitled.

24
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:55,671
Don't answer it.

25
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:03,720
- Why does she do this?
- Talk to her. You're already up.

26
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:06,807
I'll get that.

27
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:14,481
Would youpick up the phone, please?
Don't do this to me.

28
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:20,654
- Afteryou left this afternoon ...
- Can we talk about this tomorrow?

29
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:27,953
- You come andsleep with me ...
- Allie, shut that thing off.

30
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:34,334
Yousaid you were going to call.
Yousaid you'd call.

31
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:40,757
Okay ... goodbye.

32
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:49,057
I take it back. She's not entitled.

33
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:56,064
I didn't go over there
intending to sleep with her, Allie.

34
00:05:56,231 --> 00:06:01,904
She's depressed. She heard we were
getting married. She was drunk.

35
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:07,409
- I don't want to hearthis!
- She makes me feel guilty.

36
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:15,626
- It won'thappen again.
- Am lsupposed to trustyou now?.

37
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:25,719
- It's 4 a.m.!
- It's me, Graham.

38
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:30,057
- Allie?
- I'm sorry ...

39
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:34,061
Sam left. I told him to.

40
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:41,193
I can't be alone tonight ...
so I came up here.

41
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:51,328
Allie, I let you sleep.
It's about 10.

42
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:55,123
I've got an important meeting.

43
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:18,230
- I'm sorry, I'm a little late.
- No, it's worth the wait.

44
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:25,904
You can redefine your product
on-screen with my software.

45
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:29,908
This is a marketing tool
that no one else has.

46
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:34,872
- Who do I get to run it?
- Training is included in the quote.

47
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:39,042
The quote ...
That's the one thing I haven't seen.

48
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:42,754
Best for last.

49
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:48,802
You'll find that's reasonable ...
as a ballpark.

50
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:53,557
Here's where
I was thinking of playing.

51
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:01,315
It makes sense.

52
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:05,986
I made a phone call
to your former partner.

53
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:10,699
It was not a friendly split.
I did all the work.

54
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:16,079
She took all the credit and
she didn't like me telling her so.

55
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:22,669
In the settlement you got all the
hardware and a rent-controlled flat.

56
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:27,132
That means your overhead is minimal,
as is your client list.

57
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:32,095
I could improve that if you're
as good as you say you are.

58
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:36,558
But that
is the only way to prove it.

59
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:41,980
- I could go for something ...
- No, don't embarrass yourself.

60
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:47,277
That's my final offer. Of course,
if you'd like to think about it ...

61
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:50,197
I'll get this.

62
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:57,037
- It'll be on my expense report.
- I look forward to it.

63
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:12,719
No messages.

64
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:40,622
What is this? "You're Nobody
Till Somebody Loves You."

65
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:48,964
It's just living alone and cooking
for one. It's just too depressing.

66
00:09:49,131 --> 00:09:52,926
There are worse things
than being on your own.

67
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:56,889
- I should go home.
- You came here for a reason.

68
00:09:57,055 --> 00:10:01,476
You think I'd let some guy
interfere with my acting career?

69
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:04,938
If I had a career ...
or a guy to interfere with it.

70
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:08,400
- You'll find someone again.
- Maybe.

71
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:13,197
The point is,
if I don't ... I don't.

72
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:18,619
- I know. I can do it on my own.
- Absolutely.

73
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:23,165
I'll just get a room-mate.

74
00:10:23,332 --> 00:10:26,710
You could always call him.

75
00:10:27,878 --> 00:10:30,964
Not if I have a room-mate.

76
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:36,136
SWF SEEKS FEMALE TO SHARE
APARTMENT IN W70S.

77
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:40,098
NON-SMOKER
PROFESSIONAL PREFERRED

78
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,979
The managers
couldn't know you lived there.

79
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:50,734
It's rent-stabilized,
so you couldn't come on the lease.

80
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:56,406
Nice ...
you could really open 'em up.

81
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:59,034
Great.

82
00:11:09,044 --> 00:11:13,048
I'm an incest survivor, you know.
I don't remember, -

83
00:11:13,215 --> 00:11:19,429
- but I know that I survived
something. My therapists think so.

84
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:25,269
I hate kitchens, cooking, cleaning,
anything feminine.

85
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:31,275
I think this could work. If you
feel the same, give me a call.

86
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:14,026
Hello, Sam Rawson. Hello?

87
00:12:39,218 --> 00:12:44,848
The front door was open.
Are you Allison Jones?

88
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:47,267
Yes ... Allie.

89
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:53,315
I'm Hedra Carlson.
We spoke on the phone this morning.

90
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:59,655
Are you sure you're okay?

91
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:07,329
You know what? I'm not.
Would you come back tomorrow?

92
00:13:07,496 --> 00:13:14,419
- Sit down. I'll make some tea.
- I don't think I had lunch.

93
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:19,550
It's only this one.
The one in the bathroom works.

94
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:22,845
I use a wrench.

95
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:43,115
I'm so sorry.

96
00:13:43,282 --> 00:13:48,954
If you need a reference,
you can call them at Rizzoli.

97
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:56,003
Hedra ... that's unusual.

98
00:13:56,170 --> 00:14:00,799
I got terrible nicknames growing up,
which I'm not telling you.

99
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:06,388
Not Hedy? Like Hedy Lamarr?
That's exotic.

100
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:12,019
I wasn't exotic in grade school ...
as opposed to now, right?

101
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:18,692
They're dry.

102
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:23,989
- Here.
- Thanks.

103
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:31,914
You can toss that. He's the reason
I'm looking for a new room-mate.

104
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:42,758
Will you guys patch things up?
I wouldn't want to move in -

105
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:48,764
- and then have things change.
It would just be awkward.

106
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:56,605
Nothing will change, except
for now my faucets will work.

107
00:14:56,772 --> 00:15:01,318
- When can you move in?
- No, really?

108
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:11,161
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

109
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:20,546
I've got one friend. Graham.
He lives upstairs ... but he's gay.

110
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:25,259
It's not a real friendly building,
but there's no problem with privacy.

111
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:29,054
You just close your door ...
no problem.

112
00:15:29,221 --> 00:15:35,811
I'll leave you alone ...
whatever's good for you.

113
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:40,566
Look, this could be good.

114
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:44,111
Laundry room.

115
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:47,447
It's a little creepy at night.

116
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:51,201
It's okay in the day,
but lock yourself in.

117
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:54,663
- This one?
- No, that's the mail key.

118
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:57,457
This is creepy.

119
00:15:57,624 --> 00:16:00,878
It's not bad, it's just kind of old.

120
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:06,884
Sometimes this gets stuck and
you have to use this screwdriver.

121
00:16:08,886 --> 00:16:11,388
Excuse me.

122
00:16:13,557 --> 00:16:16,560
- Which floor?
- 1 1.

123
00:16:16,727 --> 00:16:19,313
14, please.

124
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:35,245
- Okay.
- Look what I found.

125
00:16:45,589 --> 00:16:49,092
I'm not sure. Hold on, I'll check.

126
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:52,387
Allie, it's Sam.

127
00:17:02,314 --> 00:17:08,487
Where do you guys learn to dress?
I mean, it's just so New York.

128
00:17:09,363 --> 00:17:13,700
I think you look very comfortable.

129
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:17,454
Yeah, I never know what looks good.

130
00:17:20,082 --> 00:17:26,338
I think that looks nice,
but with this it would look great.

131
00:17:28,257 --> 00:17:33,762
- What do you think?
- They go great with that dress.

132
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:39,351
You take them.
I'll borrow them when I want to.

133
00:18:40,704 --> 00:18:44,333
God! I didn't know you were home.

134
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:48,003
I was ...

135
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:57,554
You haven't even been here two weeks
and I'm already in your room.

136
00:18:57,721 --> 00:19:02,267
I was just about
to go through your drawers.

137
00:19:04,061 --> 00:19:07,439
That smells nice on you.

138
00:19:07,606 --> 00:19:14,238
- I always wanted to try that.
- Sure, anything you want.

139
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:18,575
- Share and share alike.
- I don't really know about that.

140
00:19:18,742 --> 00:19:24,248
I'm an only child.
Do you come from a big family?

141
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:27,626
There's just me.

142
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:38,595
I was supposed to be a twin,
but she was stillborn.

143
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:46,353
- That's so sad.
- A part of me was always missing.

144
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:52,442
Allie! God!

145
00:19:54,653 --> 00:20:02,035
It's beautiful.
Thank you. What do I owe you?

146
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:06,915
Nothing.
It's just a little housewarming.

147
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:12,421
No ...

148
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:24,016
They look beautiful on you.
It's a housewarming.

149
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:29,730
Thanks, they're great.

150
00:20:39,698 --> 00:20:42,534
No, Sam.

151
00:20:42,701 --> 00:20:46,038
No, it's not a good time.

152
00:20:46,205 --> 00:20:52,961
I'm not ready to see you. You're
prolonging something that's over.

153
00:20:53,128 --> 00:21:01,637
There's nothing to talk about.
There's somebody here right now.

154
00:21:08,685 --> 00:21:12,856
Why don't we order some Chinese?

155
00:21:18,946 --> 00:21:23,825
Hi, this is Allison Jones.
Please leave a message.

156
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:28,372
Allie, are you there?
Pick up.

157
00:21:28,539 --> 00:21:34,127
This is torture forme. I knowyou
need me as much as I need you.

158
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:39,883
I love you. I'll do anything
foryou,just call me.

159
00:21:42,469 --> 00:21:44,805
Buddy.

160
00:21:45,973 --> 00:21:49,101
What a good clean boy.

161
00:21:49,268 --> 00:21:53,272
Are you going to cheer her up?

162
00:21:53,438 --> 00:21:56,567
Do you think she'll let you stay?

163
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:04,741
YELLOW LAB PUPPY
6 WEEKS OLD, $379.75

164
00:22:17,713 --> 00:22:20,716
No messages.

165
00:22:24,011 --> 00:22:30,142
I know I shouldn't have,
but they were giving him away ...

166
00:22:30,309 --> 00:22:34,730
- They said I could bring him back.
- I hope they meant it.

167
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:42,112
His name's Buddy.

168
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:47,367
I had a dog named Buddy
when I was little.

169
00:22:51,997 --> 00:22:55,792
Tomorrow, okay. I promise.

170
00:23:42,881 --> 00:23:45,217
You're working so hard.

171
00:23:45,384 --> 00:23:51,056
- Myerson better refer some clients.
- He wll, you're the best.

172
00:23:51,223 --> 00:23:55,519
Hedy, thanks. I never
would've got it done without you.

173
00:23:55,686 --> 00:23:58,814
I love helping.

174
00:23:59,857 --> 00:24:03,110
Come here. Family portrait.

175
00:24:03,277 --> 00:24:06,196
Ready?

176
00:24:11,785 --> 00:24:17,374
I lived a few weeks
while you loved me.

177
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:20,002
Goodbye, David.

178
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,765
- Ready to kill her yet?
- Who, Hedy?

179
00:24:33,765 --> 00:24:35,475
- Ready to kill her yet?
- Who, Hedy?

180
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:38,812
No, it's fun
having a girlfriend again.

181
00:24:38,979 --> 00:24:45,152
Good. You were starting
to look like a Kennedy wife.

182
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:51,950
You were great, Graham. I just
had to spend some time with her.

183
00:24:52,117 --> 00:24:57,539
She needed a lot of help moving in.
Plus, I've been working like crazy.

184
00:24:57,706 --> 00:25:02,794
I've been meaning to come down.
I want to ask you something.

185
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:07,674
Will you cat sit again?
I have to go to my cousin's wedding.

186
00:25:07,841 --> 00:25:12,429
- Sure, I'll watch Carmen.
- I've made you a set.

187
00:25:12,596 --> 00:25:20,020
Ignore the litter box, I do.
I think I saw your room-mate.

188
00:25:20,187 --> 00:25:24,483
I thought it was you.
Your backpack. This jacket.

189
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:28,779
But it was someone else.
Very nervous.

190
00:25:28,946 --> 00:25:33,951
That's Hedy. I freaked her out
about people knowing she lives here.

191
00:25:34,117 --> 00:25:39,623
I would've had you down
to meet her ... but she's shy.

192
00:25:44,211 --> 00:25:49,049
- Friday?
- I'll make dinner when I get back.

193
00:26:03,522 --> 00:26:08,485
I thought you'd be at work.
Don't tell me we have the same belt.

194
00:26:08,652 --> 00:26:13,991
- Yeah ... I have to talk to you.
- Look, cookies for dogs.

195
00:26:14,157 --> 00:26:18,620
- I had to get them.
- Can I just talk to you ...

196
00:26:26,795 --> 00:26:30,841
I tried to let you know.

197
00:26:34,845 --> 00:26:40,726
- What are you doing here? Hedy!
- It's not her fault.

198
00:26:40,893 --> 00:26:45,856
I kind of forced my way in here.
I had to see you.

199
00:26:46,023 --> 00:26:53,113
I've got to get out of here now.
Unless you need me ...

200
00:27:02,581 --> 00:27:07,711
Why can't you just leave me alone?

201
00:27:07,878 --> 00:27:12,049
You've got to talk to me.
You can't pretend I don't exist.

202
00:27:12,216 --> 00:27:15,928
It's easier that way. Easier on me!

203
00:27:16,094 --> 00:27:21,099
People screw up.
What I did was wrong, I admit it.

204
00:27:21,266 --> 00:27:26,355
But you cut me off. You didn't
take my calls or answer my letter.

205
00:27:26,522 --> 00:27:32,528
You lied to me! lf she hadn't
called, would I have found out?

206
00:27:34,821 --> 00:27:41,203
If you want to be nice,
just stay away.

207
00:27:43,789 --> 00:27:49,211
I was hoping we could
put this thing back together.

208
00:27:49,378 --> 00:27:53,340
Well, I guess we can't.

209
00:27:53,507 --> 00:27:56,552
I didn't get any letter.

210
00:27:56,718 --> 00:28:01,056
I wasn't trying to punish you
by not answering it.

211
00:28:01,223 --> 00:28:06,895
- I sent it with the keys.
- I didn't get those, either.

212
00:28:07,062 --> 00:28:10,732
- What did it say?
- Forget the letter.

213
00:28:12,109 --> 00:28:17,030
I love you.
I can't exist without you.

214
00:28:17,197 --> 00:28:24,663
I have no excuse for what I did.
Give me a second chance.

215
00:28:31,461 --> 00:28:34,590
You really hurt me, Sam.

216
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:06,205
- Where's the biography section?
- At the front, against the wall.

217
00:29:06,371 --> 00:29:11,376
Hi, this is Allison Jones.
Please leave a message.

218
00:29:11,543 --> 00:29:16,465
Hi, Allie, it's me. I'm just calling
to see if you're okay.

219
00:29:16,632 --> 00:29:23,514
Call me at work.
My number's on the fridge.

220
00:29:28,644 --> 00:29:35,275
- Next month should be enough time.
- I'm sure she'll understand.

221
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:48,497
I mustbe in love with you.
Has ithityou that way?

222
00:29:50,624 --> 00:29:54,127
It's not for you!

223
00:29:54,962 --> 00:29:59,258
- Will itgo on foralways?
- Does anything go on foralways?

224
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:02,553
One likes to thinksome things do.

225
00:31:17,586 --> 00:31:20,797
Where the hell have you been?

226
00:31:21,965 --> 00:31:26,762
God, what are you doing in my room?

227
00:31:26,929 --> 00:31:33,185
I've been waiting to hear from you.
I've been worried sick.

228
00:31:33,352 --> 00:31:37,022
Buddy was crying.
I came in to comfort him.

229
00:31:37,189 --> 00:31:42,903
- Sorry, I just didn't think.
- There's such a thing as a phone.

230
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:51,119
- This is New York. Things happen.
- I'm sorry. It was thoughtless.

231
00:31:51,995 --> 00:31:56,500
You're making me feel
like I'm 16 years old.

232
00:32:04,258 --> 00:32:12,683
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, just ... forget it.

233
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:22,526
- I guess you've patched things up.
- I made him suffer.

234
00:32:23,652 --> 00:32:27,155
Is that an engagement ring?

235
00:32:34,746 --> 00:32:39,585
- It's a beautiful ring.
- Thanks.

236
00:32:39,751 --> 00:32:46,008
I'm sure you'll be very happy ...
and I'll be alone.

237
00:32:46,175 --> 00:32:50,721
You'll find someone, Hedy.
I mean, if I can ...

238
00:32:52,431 --> 00:32:55,726
Why don't you look in the mirror?

239
00:32:59,146 --> 00:33:01,857
Look!

240
00:33:02,024 --> 00:33:06,904
You're in a different league.
I know that.

241
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:12,117
You have this great personality.
You've got this great style.

242
00:33:12,284 --> 00:33:15,495
You're running your own business.

243
00:33:15,662 --> 00:33:19,458
You're always going to find someone.

244
00:33:20,459 --> 00:33:24,463
You'd have to be stupid
to think that you wouldn't.

245
00:33:32,387 --> 00:33:38,185
I guess you and Sam
want to be together.

246
00:33:38,352 --> 00:33:41,939
So I have to move out, right?

247
00:33:42,105 --> 00:33:47,444
Sam's keeping his place for a while.
I know you spent a lot on furniture.

248
00:33:47,611 --> 00:33:52,282
Yeah, your timing is really great!

249
00:33:52,449 --> 00:33:59,706
- You promised this wouldn't happen.
- Nothing's happened, come on.

250
00:33:59,873 --> 00:34:03,669
I'll talk to Sam.

251
00:34:03,836 --> 00:34:09,883
Maybe we'll move
if we find some place like this.

252
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:15,305
We'll figure something out. Okay?

253
00:34:17,766 --> 00:34:17,808
- They're nervous.
- Salesmen have to be sold.

254
00:34:17,808 --> 00:34:21,812
- They're nervous.
- Salesmen have to be sold.

255
00:34:21,979 --> 00:34:27,818
Let's set up a demo.
Something different, maybe at night.

256
00:34:27,985 --> 00:34:33,699
- Open bar, open minds. "F9".
- I'll set it up.

257
00:34:33,866 --> 00:34:37,828
I'll call you tonight
after I check on some things.

258
00:34:37,995 --> 00:34:41,039
"8796, Knox". What's Knox?

259
00:34:41,206 --> 00:34:45,878
Graham Knox.
That was just for last night.

260
00:34:46,044 --> 00:34:52,009
- I admit, I'm very impressed.
- Well, start spreading the word.

261
00:34:53,218 --> 00:34:58,432
I can see I'm not going to be able
to afford you any more.

262
00:35:01,518 --> 00:35:04,938
Great. Press "enter". That's it.

263
00:35:18,702 --> 00:35:22,122
Are you thirsty?

264
00:35:25,501 --> 00:35:28,962
I'll be right back.

265
00:35:46,021 --> 00:35:49,066
You'd know more about that than me.

266
00:35:57,741 --> 00:36:01,203
Allie, do you want a sip?

267
00:36:03,789 --> 00:36:10,838
I guess I'll turn in.
Goodnight, Allie. Goodnight, Sam.

268
00:38:25,889 --> 00:38:29,142
- They're ready.
- Just a minute.

269
00:38:29,309 --> 00:38:34,356
- They'll get cold.
- All right.

270
00:38:48,245 --> 00:38:53,083
No, Rawson is a Norse name.

271
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:57,212
It's a thoroughly uninteresting
conversation.

272
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:01,758
Are we going?

273
00:39:07,306 --> 00:39:12,519
- Scrambled or fried?
- This is fine.

274
00:39:16,732 --> 00:39:20,402
Sweetheart,
this isn't all that urgent.

275
00:39:20,569 --> 00:39:24,948
This apartment thing
can wait till I get back.

276
00:39:25,115 --> 00:39:28,785
Why don't we get away together?
A drive?

277
00:39:28,952 --> 00:39:31,914
Buddy, come here.

278
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:36,793
- Three's a crowd.
- It's all right, Hedy, he's fine.

279
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:41,507
- Poor guy's all confused.
- We'll take a day off ...

280
00:39:41,673 --> 00:39:45,052
No, I'm fine.

281
00:39:45,219 --> 00:39:50,933
I just didn't get a very good sleep.
Nightmares.

282
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:59,107
You've got a good day for it
if it doesn't get too hot.

283
00:39:59,274 --> 00:40:04,071
- You don't need to do that.
- I don't mind.

284
00:40:04,238 --> 00:40:09,576
It's clean
when you can't tell I'm here.

285
00:40:09,743 --> 00:40:15,040
If the eggs were okay,
maybe you'd trust me with dinner.

286
00:40:15,207 --> 00:40:20,629
- Do you know when you'll be back?
- We'll be out celebrating tonight.

287
00:40:20,796 --> 00:40:27,469
Really? That's great. Good luck.

288
00:40:37,938 --> 00:40:40,524
Goodbye.

289
00:40:48,156 --> 00:40:51,034
Buddy, come here.

290
00:40:52,327 --> 00:40:55,539
Come here, sweetie.

291
00:40:56,331 --> 00:41:00,210
I know.

292
00:41:04,423 --> 00:41:07,509
Buddy, come!

293
00:41:12,472 --> 00:41:14,558
Fine.

294
00:41:14,725 --> 00:41:19,229
This is half the size
for twice the price.

295
00:41:19,396 --> 00:41:26,320
- It's easier this way.
- It's a long way from The Victoria.

296
00:41:26,486 --> 00:41:33,327
- Do you think we can smoke her out?
- I couldn't, I'm her only friend.

297
00:41:35,037 --> 00:41:38,457
God, what happened?

298
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,046
Hedy!

299
00:41:46,256 --> 00:41:51,428
- He's dead. Buddy's dead!
- What?

300
00:41:51,595 --> 00:41:55,682
You left the window open.
How could you do that?

301
00:41:55,849 --> 00:42:00,229
I thought we could leave it open.
You fixed it.

302
00:42:00,395 --> 00:42:05,067
- I thought I did.
- It's me.

303
00:42:05,234 --> 00:42:12,324
I interrupted you
when I called you in for breakfast.

304
00:42:44,398 --> 00:42:50,863
- Thanks, that pill helped.
- Are you still leaving tomorrow?

305
00:42:52,072 --> 00:42:55,284
Well, she wants me to.

306
00:43:00,789 --> 00:43:07,254
If I'd just let you finish your work
this morning ...

307
00:43:10,841 --> 00:43:16,638
If she blames anybody,
she blames me.

308
00:44:17,741 --> 00:44:20,077
Hi, Mitch.

309
00:44:21,036 --> 00:44:23,247
What?

310
00:44:23,997 --> 00:44:32,923
No, I'm just running a little late.
I didn't forget.

311
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:37,427
Just hold them till five, okay?

312
00:45:44,745 --> 00:45:51,418
You were terrific ...
but you know that, don't you?

313
00:45:51,585 --> 00:45:57,424
And I thought
all the guys would resist you.

314
00:45:57,591 --> 00:46:02,262
- As if anyone ever could.
- No, I've got to go.

315
00:46:02,429 --> 00:46:05,432
Hold it. Not so fast.

316
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:11,563
Now everybody under me
knows more than I do. I hate that.

317
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:17,194
Find some time for me next week.
It's just a little late tonight.

318
00:46:17,361 --> 00:46:23,033
Please, just a taste.
Something simple.

319
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,327
Right now.

320
00:46:33,877 --> 00:46:37,005
Something simple.

321
00:46:44,221 --> 00:46:48,976
This is just the Mickey-Mouse stuff,
but it does come in handy.

322
00:46:51,061 --> 00:46:54,815
Enter the vendor's name.

323
00:46:56,108 --> 00:46:59,778
J-o-n-e-s.

324
00:47:00,612 --> 00:47:05,701
- A-l-l-i-s-o-n.
- Very good.

325
00:47:05,868 --> 00:47:10,873
"Contract price", "Payment to date",
"Balance outstanding".

326
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:16,044
- We should've paid you last Friday.
- Barbara will handle it.

327
00:47:16,211 --> 00:47:19,923
Not till I give her the word.

328
00:47:20,090 --> 00:47:25,095
- I hope you're satisfied with me.
- So far.

329
00:47:25,262 --> 00:47:30,017
But this is it.
There ain't much more.

330
00:47:30,184 --> 00:47:33,645
A little fine tuning, that's it.

331
00:47:33,812 --> 00:47:37,316
I would like
to meet your colleagues.

332
00:47:37,482 --> 00:47:42,696
I was thinking
of keeping you to myself.

333
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:49,786
- What are you doing?
- You're just so tight.

334
00:47:49,953 --> 00:47:53,081
Mitch, please, don't. That's enough.

335
00:47:54,499 --> 00:47:59,588
Look ...
I've been a good boy, haven't l?

336
00:47:59,755 --> 00:48:04,676
And you've been a good girl.
We have nothing to prove any more.

337
00:48:04,843 --> 00:48:10,098
This is your last chance to play
before you're an old married lady.

338
00:48:12,059 --> 00:48:15,395
Let me turn around, okay?

339
00:48:16,146 --> 00:48:19,691
That's better.

340
00:48:23,904 --> 00:48:26,406
Just a second.

341
00:48:35,499 --> 00:48:37,918
Fucking bitch!

342
00:48:41,713 --> 00:48:44,550
Take this.

343
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:52,349
I can't believe
I didn't see it coming.

344
00:48:53,475 --> 00:48:59,481
- It's just so humiliating.
- The problem is you're too nice.

345
00:48:59,648 --> 00:49:05,195
Men are pigs.
I don't care how nice they seem.

346
00:49:05,988 --> 00:49:09,658
You always fall for that.

347
00:49:11,076 --> 00:49:14,454
But what I did ...

348
00:49:14,621 --> 00:49:21,545
It was like something inside
taking over. It was scary.

349
00:49:21,712 --> 00:49:28,468
No, don't turn this around. You're
the victim. He should pay for this.

350
00:49:28,635 --> 00:49:33,807
He'll pay. I set up my programmes.
He'll have to eventually.

351
00:49:33,974 --> 00:49:38,187
It's not about getting paid,
it's about getting even.

352
00:49:38,353 --> 00:49:43,901
You don't understand. It's the
contacts more than the money.

353
00:49:44,067 --> 00:49:48,614
I took the job for the word of mouth
and now that's gone.

354
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:55,329
- He's put me back to square one.
- Only if you let him.

355
00:49:56,413 --> 00:50:01,919
- What can I do?
- Allie ...

356
00:50:08,091 --> 00:50:14,139
Of course, Sam's away.
I didn't want to say anything ...

357
00:50:14,306 --> 00:50:18,018
How he could go
the day after Buddy died.

358
00:50:18,185 --> 00:50:22,064
Especially when it was his fault.

359
00:50:28,111 --> 00:50:32,658
- May I speak with your husband?
- Who are you calling?

360
00:50:32,824 --> 00:50:38,080
I know it's late. Tell him it's
Allison Jones, he'll take the call.

361
00:50:42,668 --> 00:50:47,673
Listen, you pathetic shit. Do you
want to hold on to your business?

362
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:50,926
No, you listen to me , asshole!

363
00:50:51,093 --> 00:50:57,266
If you trash me around town, you're
fucked and your family is, too!

364
00:50:57,432 --> 00:51:01,019
It won't just be you.

365
00:51:08,110 --> 00:51:13,073
Let me tell you, he is pissing
in his p.j.'s right now.

366
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:17,119
Gee, Hedy, I hope
you never get mad at me.

367
00:51:17,995 --> 00:51:24,960
- Hedy, we really have to talk.
- I have a surprise for you.

368
00:51:26,837 --> 00:51:30,465
I'm not up for this today.

369
00:51:30,632 --> 00:51:35,470
It'll be fun. It'll make you
feel better, I promise.

370
00:51:35,637 --> 00:51:38,056
And I'm paying.

371
00:51:40,058 --> 00:51:43,187
It'll be fine, come on.

372
00:52:01,496 --> 00:52:04,666
You've got to be kidding.

373
00:52:09,379 --> 00:52:14,885
- You should've asked first.
- I wanted it to be a surprise.

374
00:52:15,052 --> 00:52:18,597
This feels so good on my neck.

375
00:52:20,307 --> 00:52:24,937
I didn't think you'd mind.

376
00:52:40,536 --> 00:52:44,373
I'm going to take a shower.

377
00:53:47,102 --> 00:53:50,564
Ellen Besch.

378
00:53:56,028 --> 00:53:59,489
AUTOMATED MAIL
PO BOX 72810, NEW YORK

379
00:54:06,205 --> 00:54:11,960
NINE-YEAR-OLD BESCH TWIN
DROWNS AT FAMILY PICNIC

380
00:54:20,219 --> 00:54:23,514
Sam!

381
00:54:38,278 --> 00:54:41,949
I LOVE YOU, ALLIE
SAM

382
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:18,861
Do you want me to fix you something
before I go?

383
00:55:19,027 --> 00:55:23,699
No, thanks.
I'm going up to visit Graham.

384
00:55:23,866 --> 00:55:27,703
- I love myself like this.
- Have fun.

385
00:55:31,707 --> 00:55:36,003
I love myself like this.

386
00:56:18,003 --> 00:56:20,088
Taxi!

387
00:56:33,185 --> 00:56:37,189
Don't lose her.
She has something of mine.

388
00:57:50,888 --> 00:57:55,058
- Do you want to play?
- No, thanks.

389
00:58:12,784 --> 00:58:17,497
- Come on, Jim.
- Allie, regular or diet?

390
00:58:17,664 --> 00:58:21,710
- Diet.
- Something's different.

391
00:58:21,877 --> 00:58:25,547
Jim, you look like
my sister's boyfriend.

392
00:58:25,714 --> 00:58:31,345
- Jesus, Allie, what is it?
- You've got to help me, Graham.

393
00:58:32,137 --> 00:58:34,640
Allie?

394
00:58:36,517 --> 00:58:39,686
I'm home.

395
00:58:42,564 --> 00:58:44,983
Allie?

396
00:58:53,033 --> 00:58:57,496
It's like looking atmyself.

397
00:58:57,663 --> 00:59:02,292
Andshe lies.
I found a shoebox in herroom.

398
00:59:02,459 --> 00:59:08,799
Nothingshe told me is true.
She said hertwin died atbirth.

399
00:59:08,966 --> 00:59:12,928
It was in an accident
when she was nine.

400
00:59:13,095 --> 00:59:17,891
And she stole a letter
that Sam wrote me.

401
00:59:20,519 --> 00:59:23,939
- I have to do something.
- Get rid of her.

402
00:59:24,106 --> 00:59:30,153
Call the police ifyou have to.
You've got to getherout

403
00:59:31,405 --> 00:59:35,242
You're right. I'll tell her tonight.

404
00:59:35,409 --> 00:59:39,705
I can't just throw her out
on the street.

405
00:59:39,872 --> 00:59:43,250
- She needs help.
- Do it tonight.

406
00:59:44,751 --> 00:59:50,007
I feel responsible for her.
I'm the only one she has.

407
00:59:50,174 --> 00:59:56,722
Either she's gone by Saturday,
or I go to the police, okay?

408
00:59:56,889 --> 01:00:02,769
- That was very impressive.
- I can be butch when I have to.

409
01:00:02,936 --> 01:00:07,608
I've got a friend who's a shrink.
Maybe he can help her.

410
01:00:07,774 --> 01:00:12,613
- When I talk to her, she may leave.
- Do you want to sleep here tonight?

411
01:00:12,779 --> 01:00:19,203
Don't tempt me. I just needed
to talk it out. Thanks.

412
01:00:21,788 --> 01:00:26,293
- She's not going to chase me out.
- When's Sam coming back?

413
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:30,672
- Tomorrow.
- That's good.

414
01:00:30,839 --> 01:00:36,595
This is a little embarrassing, but
now we're letting our hair down ...

415
01:00:36,762 --> 01:00:42,059
Those old air vents between
our apartments carry sound.

416
01:00:42,226 --> 01:00:45,896
It's a weird acoustic thing.

417
01:00:46,939 --> 01:00:50,234
What do you hear?

418
01:00:51,193 --> 01:00:54,530
Oh, no!

419
01:00:54,696 --> 01:01:00,327
- I'm sorry.
- I should've mentioned it sooner.

420
01:01:00,494 --> 01:01:04,248
You're sure
you want to go down there?

421
01:01:06,959 --> 01:01:12,798
Yeah, she's my problem.
I'll handle it.

422
01:01:14,049 --> 01:01:19,388
Thank you for the tea.
I'll see you tomorrow.

423
01:01:35,070 --> 01:01:37,573
Hedy?

424
01:02:09,271 --> 01:02:15,485
This is serious. I know you
can't diagnose over the phone.

425
01:02:15,652 --> 01:02:19,823
I don't know what hypervigilant is.
I've never met the woman.

426
01:02:19,990 --> 01:02:23,285
She could be
infantile or paranoid, whatever.

427
01:02:35,088 --> 01:02:42,429
I'll go down and call from there.
She can tell you better than I can.

428
01:02:45,807 --> 01:02:49,520
Thanks.
So you might hear from us.

429
01:02:49,686 --> 01:02:53,857
Love to Jack.
And you're not charging me for this.

430
01:02:59,738 --> 01:03:02,783
Carmen ...

431
01:03:09,957 --> 01:03:13,210
- Allie!
- Goodnight.

432
01:03:13,377 --> 01:03:16,338
Hedy?

433
01:03:16,505 --> 01:03:19,258
I'm sorry ...

434
01:03:19,424 --> 01:03:25,013
Wait, take it easy.
We just want to get you some help.

435
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:29,643
Please ...
I didn't do anything wrong.

436
01:03:29,810 --> 01:03:34,356
- Take it easy.
- I didn't do anything.

437
01:03:43,532 --> 01:03:48,495
Mr. Besch, you don't know me,
my name is Allison Jones.

438
01:03:48,662 --> 01:03:53,292
I think my room-mate Hedra
is your daughter. Ellen.

439
01:03:53,458 --> 01:03:58,213
I'm not sure, really.

440
01:03:58,380 --> 01:04:01,717
She's been
under a lot of stress lately ...

441
01:04:01,884 --> 01:04:07,764
I'd rather not get into this
on an answering machine.

442
01:04:07,931 --> 01:04:13,145
Could you please give one of us
a call? You must have the number.

443
01:04:13,312 --> 01:04:17,774
It's 212-555-9814.

444
01:04:17,941 --> 01:04:22,029
Don't say I called.

445
01:04:22,196 --> 01:04:25,282
Hedy?

446
01:04:39,796 --> 01:04:42,257
Hedy?

447
01:04:43,008 --> 01:04:45,677
What?

448
01:04:47,721 --> 01:04:53,477
- Are you all right?.
- I can't hear you.

449
01:04:57,397 --> 01:05:01,902
I was starting to worry.
You've been in here so long.

450
01:05:02,069 --> 01:05:05,739
Do you want some camomile tea?

451
01:05:09,076 --> 01:05:14,456
Yeah ... that'd be great.

452
01:05:23,590 --> 01:05:27,261
I'm not feeling really well.

453
01:05:32,766 --> 01:05:37,980
Mine always comes
when I'm wearing something nice.

454
01:05:43,652 --> 01:05:48,490
Are you crampy?
Sometimes tea helps.

455
01:05:48,657 --> 01:05:52,119
Something warm. We could talk.

456
01:05:52,286 --> 01:05:55,622
About what?

457
01:05:55,789 --> 01:06:03,755
About Sam and I
wanting this place for ourselves.

458
01:06:05,465 --> 01:06:10,971
You need a long engagement
to make sure you can trust him.

459
01:06:11,138 --> 01:06:17,603
Frankly. that's my business.
I'm sorry, but it is.

460
01:06:21,148 --> 01:06:25,277
It's me, isn't it?

461
01:06:28,322 --> 01:06:31,450
I'll change, Allie. I can change.

462
01:06:31,617 --> 01:06:36,371
No, that's not it at all.
You've been a good room-mate.

463
01:06:37,247 --> 01:06:42,961
This is the man I'm going to marry.
I want us to live together.

464
01:06:45,839 --> 01:06:51,845
He will cheat on you again,
that's a promise.

465
01:06:52,012 --> 01:06:56,642
And when he does,
don't come running to me.

466
01:06:56,808 --> 01:07:00,979
I've had it with you.
You're so fucking weak!

467
01:07:06,401 --> 01:07:10,155
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

468
01:07:20,249 --> 01:07:23,043
Allie?

469
01:07:29,049 --> 01:07:32,177
- Is it Sam?
- Ellen, is thatyou?

470
01:07:32,344 --> 01:07:37,015
Talk to me oryourmother.
We miss you. Come home.

471
01:07:37,182 --> 01:07:40,227
Don't call here again.

472
01:07:40,394 --> 01:07:48,193
We'llstop sending the cheques .
No doctors this time,just come.

473
01:07:51,446 --> 01:07:56,034
Obscene phone call. New York!

474
01:07:56,785 --> 01:08:02,541
- Find someone else, jerk!
- I'm expecting a call from Sam.

475
01:08:02,708 --> 01:08:07,296
Just for a while.
Sam will call back if it's busy.

476
01:08:07,462 --> 01:08:13,302
I'm sorry, Allie. It's no big deal.
I'll find some other place.

477
01:08:13,468 --> 01:08:18,682
- I don't want you making a mistake.
- I understand.

478
01:08:18,849 --> 01:08:24,313
- We'll still be friends.
- Sure.

479
01:08:49,463 --> 01:08:52,591
- Allie?
- No, it's Hedy.

480
01:08:52,758 --> 01:08:59,598
- Where are you?
- I just got in. Is she asleep?

481
01:09:00,974 --> 01:09:06,813
- Yeah, do you want me to wake her?
- No, tell herto surprise me.

482
01:09:06,980 --> 01:09:11,318
- I'll tell her.
- Goodnight, honey.

483
01:09:11,485 --> 01:09:15,155
Goodnight, Sam. Sleep well.

484
01:10:09,001 --> 01:10:12,671
Allie, what are you doing here?

485
01:10:37,946 --> 01:10:42,618
- Allie?
- No, not Allie.

486
01:11:56,275 --> 01:11:59,027
Hey, sleepy guy.

487
01:12:04,116 --> 01:12:06,702
I knew it.

488
01:12:07,953 --> 01:12:11,582
- Knew what?
- I told her.

489
01:12:11,748 --> 01:12:16,378
Guys like you don't change.
You can't be faithful.

490
01:12:16,545 --> 01:12:20,924
And now she'll know.

491
01:12:22,092 --> 01:12:24,845
She'll know what?

492
01:12:27,681 --> 01:12:35,606
That you came up here and pretended
to be her? What is this hair?

493
01:12:35,772 --> 01:12:41,028
You're n her clothes.
You're wearing her perfume!

494
01:12:43,864 --> 01:12:47,618
You knew it was me.

495
01:12:47,784 --> 01:12:53,165
You knew and you didn't care.

496
01:12:53,332 --> 01:12:57,503
I think she should know that.

497
01:12:57,669 --> 01:13:02,591
You think she's going to thank you
for that news, do you?

498
01:13:02,758 --> 01:13:09,056
- You can't understand friendship.
- She can't stand you!

499
01:13:11,183 --> 01:13:15,187
- That's not true.
- Bullshit!

500
01:13:15,354 --> 01:13:20,275
You're too needy.
You're constantly in her face.

501
01:13:20,442 --> 01:13:27,241
She needs me. Who was there for her
when her boss almost raped her?

502
01:13:27,407 --> 01:13:31,578
You were off on a business trip
or screwing someone.

503
01:13:31,745 --> 01:13:37,668
- She never told me that.
- That's right, she told me.

504
01:13:37,835 --> 01:13:43,549
So ... don't try and make me think
that we're not close.

505
01:13:43,715 --> 01:13:50,013
We lean on each other
and we protect each other.

506
01:13:50,180 --> 01:13:54,059
We're best friends.

507
01:13:54,226 --> 01:14:01,733
You're nuts, you know that?
I think you're out of your skull.

508
01:14:04,862 --> 01:14:08,240
Yeah, well, sticks and stones ...

509
01:14:11,827 --> 01:14:15,330
- Don't touch me!
- I'm sorry.

510
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:23,380
I know you want to save face.
I won't tell her, okay?

511
01:14:23,547 --> 01:14:30,304
Just call her and tell her you're
going back to your ex-wife.

512
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:34,558
I won't say a word.

513
01:14:34,725 --> 01:14:39,146
You won't have to say a word.
I'll tell her myself.

514
01:14:41,106 --> 01:14:43,400
Fucking bitch!

515
01:15:17,768 --> 01:15:20,437
Goodnight, Miss Jones.

516
01:15:21,813 --> 01:15:23,899
Goodnight.

517
01:15:43,043 --> 01:15:45,128
Hedy?

518
01:16:04,439 --> 01:16:09,862
I hope I didn't wake you.
I got an early start.

519
01:16:10,028 --> 01:16:17,035
- You don't have to move out today.
- There, I think that's it.

520
01:16:17,202 --> 01:16:22,416
I hope you don't mind me storing
some stuff in the cage downstairs.

521
01:16:22,583 --> 01:16:25,586
It'll be less bother.

522
01:16:26,545 --> 01:16:32,342
Sure, that's fine.
I'm really sorry it didn't work out.

523
01:16:32,509 --> 01:16:38,390
I'd better get this stuff
out of here.

524
01:16:40,642 --> 01:16:45,189
We can have breakfast
when you get back.

525
01:17:27,481 --> 01:17:31,026
Morning Newsbreak ...

526
01:17:36,740 --> 01:17:39,910
Police found the body this morning.

527
01:17:40,077 --> 01:17:46,708
Identification ofthe white male of
around 30 years ofage is pending.

528
01:17:46,875 --> 01:17:53,882
A witness heard a struggle in room
612, around 4 o'clock this morning.

529
01:17:59,263 --> 01:18:05,102
- Atherton Hotel.
- Sam Rawson's room, please. 612.

530
01:18:05,269 --> 01:18:10,649
I'm sorry, there's been an accident.
Youshouldspeak to the police.

531
01:19:01,283 --> 01:19:03,327
Allie?

532
01:19:05,495 --> 01:19:07,581
What are you doing?

533
01:19:14,421 --> 01:19:18,842
I just suddenly felt sick.
It was the funniest thing.

534
01:19:19,009 --> 01:19:22,429
I hope I'm not pregnant.

535
01:19:22,596 --> 01:19:28,310
Let me help you.
Let me get you some water.

536
01:19:31,313 --> 01:19:33,815
Drink some.

537
01:19:37,778 --> 01:19:44,284
- Are you feeling better?
- Yeah, I'm going out for a while.

538
01:19:44,451 --> 01:19:49,373
- I thought you said breakfast?
- Yeah, it's in the blender.

539
01:19:49,540 --> 01:19:54,002
Dressed like that?

540
01:19:54,169 --> 01:19:59,216
I'm going to see Graham.
He called while you were out.

541
01:20:03,595 --> 01:20:11,812
Still, if you're not feeling well,
you should wear more than that.

542
01:20:15,065 --> 01:20:18,694
Maybe you're right.

543
01:20:20,696 --> 01:20:25,325
Leave the door open so we can talk.

544
01:20:36,170 --> 01:20:40,424
You know why I think you're sick?

545
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:45,220
You're upset about Sam.

546
01:20:54,479 --> 01:20:58,275
You know Sam's dead, don't you?

547
01:20:59,526 --> 01:21:03,322
Yeah, we don't have much time.

548
01:21:05,908 --> 01:21:09,620
You didn't do it, Hedy, did you?

549
01:21:12,122 --> 01:21:16,126
You couldn't have!

550
01:21:16,293 --> 01:21:18,962
Why?

551
01:21:21,590 --> 01:21:25,260
Allie, he came in my mouth.

552
01:21:25,427 --> 01:21:29,890
Then he wanted to beat the shit out
of me because I wanted to tell you.

553
01:21:32,184 --> 01:21:35,437
It was an accident.

554
01:21:38,023 --> 01:21:42,653
But he deserved it.

555
01:21:45,072 --> 01:21:51,119
Come on.
The police will be here soon.

556
01:21:54,081 --> 01:21:57,209
But you shouldn't run.

557
01:21:58,210 --> 01:22:01,797
That'll only make it worse.

558
01:22:01,964 --> 01:22:05,133
You weren't yourself
when you did this.

559
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:08,971
I know. I was you.

560
01:22:09,888 --> 01:22:14,017
Who is this Hedy anyway?

561
01:22:14,184 --> 01:22:19,773
No one's seen her.
She's not on the lease.

562
01:22:19,940 --> 01:22:25,737
There's not even a fingerprint.
I've been cleaning like crazy.

563
01:22:30,075 --> 01:22:36,540
- They'd put you away.
- Hedy, it'll never work.

564
01:22:36,707 --> 01:22:39,960
Besides ... people have seen you.

565
01:22:41,211 --> 01:22:47,134
We'll get a lawyer and a doctor and
they'll explain it to the police.

566
01:22:49,887 --> 01:22:52,472
No.

567
01:22:58,979 --> 01:23:02,608
Why are you making me do this?

568
01:23:03,483 --> 01:23:10,449
We're friends, Allie. You'll be
in a lot of trouble without me.

569
01:23:10,616 --> 01:23:14,369
But I'm not going to leave you.

570
01:23:14,536 --> 01:23:20,167
That wouldn't be right.
I won't leave you. Let's go.

571
01:23:20,334 --> 01:23:23,962
Up!

572
01:23:24,129 --> 01:23:27,966
Go!

573
01:23:33,555 --> 01:23:39,311
No, up to Graham's.
He's already involved.

574
01:23:51,365 --> 01:23:56,912
- Nobody's home.
- Use these. Go on, hurry up.

575
01:23:59,665 --> 01:24:04,628
He must be sleeping.
We were up late last night.

576
01:24:04,795 --> 01:24:09,341
- Graham?
- He can't hear you.

577
01:24:13,595 --> 01:24:16,723
Wait till you see me.

578
01:24:18,642 --> 01:24:24,273
It was beautiful, but I can't
go around looking like you any more.

579
01:24:24,439 --> 01:24:29,111
Okay now, Allie, don't laugh.

580
01:24:40,497 --> 01:24:43,584
How's that? Good?

581
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:48,422
23 and 24 are the movie channels.
I've got to cash a pay cheque.

582
01:24:48,589 --> 01:24:55,429
I'll only be gone an hour.
I know how you hate to be alone.

583
01:24:57,556 --> 01:25:06,190
When I get back, we'll do
your hair, too. Be good. Bye.

584
01:26:00,202 --> 01:26:04,206
- What's the part this time?
- Excuse me?

585
01:26:04,373 --> 01:26:09,378
You're an actress, right?
You're never the same person twice.

586
01:26:09,545 --> 01:26:14,758
I like it. I just thought
the other was more you.

587
01:26:14,925 --> 01:26:20,389
- Maybe next time I'll try blonde.
- Really? I'm flattered. Thanks.

588
01:26:20,556 --> 01:26:24,518
Miss Besch?
Your father's been calling here.

589
01:26:24,685 --> 01:26:28,522
He'll come to New York
if you don't call him.

590
01:27:11,773 --> 01:27:13,984
Do you live here?

591
01:27:15,402 --> 01:27:21,825
No, I'm just watching the place.
It's on a timer. I'm sorry.

592
01:27:21,992 --> 01:27:27,748
- I have to register a complaint.
- Please, I'll turn it off.

593
01:27:40,219 --> 01:27:43,013
How could you do that?

594
01:27:43,180 --> 01:27:49,269
Everything I've done, I've done
for you. Don't you understand that?

595
01:27:51,855 --> 01:27:55,025
People like you don't care.

596
01:27:56,485 --> 01:28:01,949
Just like that stupid girl in Tampa.
She called my parents, too.

597
01:28:02,115 --> 01:28:05,369
Told them all my secrets.

598
01:28:05,536 --> 01:28:08,872
You want to put me away.

599
01:28:11,917 --> 01:28:17,339
I can't keep making excuses
for you, Allie.

600
01:28:17,506 --> 01:28:22,469
I can't ... I can't ...

601
01:28:24,263 --> 01:28:27,307
God!

602
01:28:51,498 --> 01:28:53,584
What?

603
01:28:55,752 --> 01:28:59,298
What?

604
01:28:59,464 --> 01:29:04,261
- Please ...
- No.

605
01:29:10,184 --> 01:29:14,354
Don't make me leave you, Ellen.

606
01:29:50,724 --> 01:29:54,353
It's okay.

607
01:29:56,480 --> 01:30:00,025
We've got to get out of here now.

608
01:30:13,539 --> 01:30:15,999
Jesus ... Mitch!

609
01:30:16,166 --> 01:30:20,295
- Get in here.
- What?

610
01:30:21,880 --> 01:30:26,635
- What is it?
- Look.

611
01:30:26,802 --> 01:30:30,389
It's erasing.

612
01:30:31,348 --> 01:30:34,476
I didn't do anything.

613
01:30:45,529 --> 01:30:48,407
On mine, too!

614
01:30:50,367 --> 01:30:55,497
"The last payment from
Fontana Fashions is past due."

615
01:30:55,664 --> 01:31:00,752
"Contact Allison Jones today or your
data will be irretrievably lost."

616
01:31:00,919 --> 01:31:07,467
"This payment policing programme
is installed on all my software."

617
01:31:10,095 --> 01:31:13,849
Should I just plug this
in the phone jack?

618
01:31:14,892 --> 01:31:20,147
- You can make reservations on this?
- And you can pay by credit card.

619
01:31:21,982 --> 01:31:25,569
- L.A., right?
- Yeah.

620
01:31:25,736 --> 01:31:31,867
- No answer at the first number.
- What about Knox?

621
01:31:40,501 --> 01:31:45,881
Busy.
Turn 'em off. Turn 'em all off!

622
01:31:55,307 --> 01:31:59,561
Things are going to be different
in L.A.

623
01:32:00,437 --> 01:32:03,565
- First class?
- Is it worth it?

624
01:32:03,732 --> 01:32:10,239
We can use one of Graham's cards.
I saw his wallet in the living room.

625
01:32:10,405 --> 01:32:14,451
I'll go see.

626
01:32:25,546 --> 01:32:30,133
PLEASE HELP ME.
THIS IS NOT A JOKE.

627
01:32:30,300 --> 01:32:35,055
I know I saw it.
Maybe it's in the kitchen.

628
01:32:35,222 --> 01:32:37,975
I'M AT 768 W. 74TH STREET

629
01:32:47,067 --> 01:32:49,444
No! No!

630
01:32:56,201 --> 01:32:59,371
Going down.

631
01:33:07,880 --> 01:33:12,384
That's okay ...

632
01:33:50,881 --> 01:33:56,470
Excuse me, is this 1203?
ls Graham Knox at home?

633
01:33:58,472 --> 01:34:05,062
- No, he's on a cruise.
- I'm looking for Allison Jones?

634
01:34:05,229 --> 01:34:08,357
- Who are you?
- Mitchell Myerson.

635
01:34:08,524 --> 01:34:11,818
She did a job for me.

636
01:34:14,196 --> 01:34:19,159
- She's not on this floor.
- I was down at her apartment.

637
01:34:19,326 --> 01:34:22,621
But I did contact her here once.

638
01:34:22,788 --> 01:34:29,002
I'm the only one here
and I never met her. Excuse me.

639
01:34:33,340 --> 01:34:37,678
This is hers. You do know her.

640
01:34:44,685 --> 01:34:48,355
What the fuck is going on here?

641
01:34:51,441 --> 01:34:54,194
Be careful, she's crazy.

642
01:34:54,361 --> 01:34:56,655
Get off of her.

643
01:34:58,156 --> 01:35:02,327
You think she wants you
touching her? Get off her!

644
01:35:02,494 --> 01:35:07,165
Okay, I'm getting up.

645
01:35:21,930 --> 01:35:25,517
- Where is she?
- Don't worry, I took care of her.

646
01:35:54,671 --> 01:35:59,259
I don't want to try
to be loved any more.

647
01:35:59,426 --> 01:36:04,515
I don't want to be scared any more.

648
01:36:04,681 --> 01:36:09,728
Or to kill any more.
I don't want to kill any more.

649
01:36:09,895 --> 01:36:14,107
I don't want to be alone any more.

650
01:36:14,274 --> 01:36:18,904
I don't want
to be anything any more.

651
01:36:19,071 --> 01:36:23,700
I don't need a reason
to kill myself ...

652
01:36:23,867 --> 01:36:27,454
I need a reason not to ...

653
01:36:27,621 --> 01:36:30,791
... and there isn't one.

654
01:36:33,752 --> 01:36:38,590
You want to say anything special
to anyone?

655
01:36:39,883 --> 01:36:45,264
Okay, "Allison Jones", go on.

656
01:36:57,776 --> 01:37:02,656
Now they'll know it was you.

657
01:37:02,823 --> 01:37:09,288
No one will believe I wrote that.
I was never that scared.

658
01:37:11,123 --> 01:37:17,838
- Well ... not like that.
- Of course it's you.

659
01:37:19,631 --> 01:37:26,096
I never met anyone
so scared of being alone.

660
01:37:26,263 --> 01:37:32,227
And I saved you from that,
but you don't care.

661
01:37:35,898 --> 01:37:41,570
Did you know that identical twins
are never really identical?

662
01:37:41,737 --> 01:37:44,907
There's always one who's prettier.

663
01:37:45,574 --> 01:37:50,704
And the one who's not
does all the work.

664
01:37:51,496 --> 01:37:57,753
She used me
and then she left me.

665
01:37:57,920 --> 01:38:01,006
Just like you.

666
01:38:02,216 --> 01:38:06,261
Come on ... take them.

667
01:38:06,428 --> 01:38:11,767
- Come on, it's nicer this way.
- Okay.

668
01:38:41,797 --> 01:38:44,341
Allie!

669
01:38:44,508 --> 01:38:46,885
Please ...

670
01:38:48,971 --> 01:38:55,060
I'm not like your sister, Hedy.
Not any more. I'm like you now.

671
01:38:56,895 --> 01:38:58,939
Graham!

672
01:39:01,149 --> 01:39:04,194
I'll kill you!

673
01:39:04,987 --> 01:39:07,364
Get off him!

674
01:39:12,369 --> 01:39:15,414
Graham, stay inside!

675
01:41:10,112 --> 01:41:12,614
EXIT

676
01:41:43,437 --> 01:41:46,064
Allie?

677
01:42:01,413 --> 01:42:04,249
Hey, here you are.

678
01:42:13,217 --> 01:42:16,637
Don't make me come get you.

679
01:42:18,555 --> 01:42:22,768
Allie, come out now.

680
01:42:32,694 --> 01:42:36,365
Come on. Come out now!

681
01:42:42,913 --> 01:42:45,457
I'm scared!

682
01:42:45,624 --> 01:42:48,919
Where are you?

683
01:43:28,625 --> 01:43:32,171
Why are you hiding from me?

684
01:43:35,340 --> 01:43:41,638
You think I can't find you?
Your shirt is sticking out.

685
01:44:26,266 --> 01:44:30,270
I cried the whole week
ofSam's funeral.

686
01:44:30,437 --> 01:44:34,399
Graham says
that won'tbring him back.

687
01:44:34,566 --> 01:44:37,861
He says I have to startletting go.
He's right.

688
01:44:37,861 --> 01:44:39,488
He says I have to startletting go.
He's right.

689
01:44:39,655 --> 01:44:43,325
Hedy's parents said
they'd tried to explain to her-

690
01:44:43,492 --> 01:44:47,246
- thathersister's death
wasn'therfault.

691
01:44:47,412 --> 01:44:51,250
Butshe neverforgave herself
forsurviving.

692
01:44:51,416 --> 01:44:56,296
So every day,
I try to forgive Hedy forSam.

693
01:44:56,463 --> 01:45:02,553
Then I try to do what
she couldn't... Forgive myself.

694
01:45:02,719 --> 01:45:07,391
I know what can happen
to someone who doesn't.

695
01:47:45,757 --> 01:47:50,345
