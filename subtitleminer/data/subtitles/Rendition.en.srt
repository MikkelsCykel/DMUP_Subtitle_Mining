00:00:49,682 --> 00:00:50,940
It was great
to have you, Anwar.

2
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,842
Thank you.
It was an honor to be here.

3
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:54,377
Your presentation
was outstanding.

4
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:56,427
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

5
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:58,248
Okay. Take care.

6
00:00:58,258 --> 00:00:59,282
Thank you.

7
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:03,797
Oh, there's my phone.
Sorry I have to rush. I'm sorry.

8
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:17,834
Good save!

9
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:19,736
Again, Mom.

10
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,771
Okay. Here it comes.

11
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:25,141
Okay, get back up.

12
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:27,110
- Hello.
- Did you just try to call me?

13
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,112
- No. Where are you?
- Well, I'm still in Cape Town.

14
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:30,346
I'm on my way
to the airport now.

15
00:01:30,356 --> 00:01:31,881
Okay. I thought you were
gonna call me earlier.

16
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:34,384
I know. I'm sorry.
I had meetings all day.

17
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:35,418
- Oh, yeah. Right.
- Is that Dad?

18
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:38,059
Yeah. Do you wanna talk to him?

19
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:40,757
Your son wants a word with you.
Hold on.

20
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,258
Hey, Dad,
did you get me a present?

21
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:45,169
- Jeremy.
- What? He said he would.

22
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:48,064
- Did you?
- Hey, monkey. Sure I did.

23
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:50,033
Okay, cool.

24
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:52,202
- Okay, get in the goal. Hey.
- Come on, Mom.

25
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:54,003
- What are you doing?
- I'm playing soccer.

26
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:55,672
You'll give my mother
a heart attack.

27
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:58,408
- Yeah. Nuru's fine.
- Mom, kick the ball.

28
00:01:58,418 --> 00:01:59,909
Is your flight schedule
still the same?

29
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:01,711
Yes.
Connecting through Washington.

30
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:03,480
- Arrive Chicago at 7:45 p.m.
- Uh-huh.

31
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,648
Okay, we'll see you
at the airport.

32
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:07,217
- Okay. Bye.
- All right. I love you.

33
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:09,119
- I love you, too.
- Bye.

34
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,129
Okay. You get ready.

35
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:13,056
Here it comes.

36
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:15,066
Goal!

37
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,021
Mm-hmm.

38
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:14,617
Who you talkin' to?

39
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:16,627
My grandmother.

40
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:19,822
- She up early?
- Mm-hmm.

41
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:21,357
- Yeah.
- I call her once a week.

42
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,577
Are her goats in a frenzy?

43
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:31,334
When are they picking you up?

44
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:33,608
- Too soon.
- Yeah.

45
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:34,771
- Mm.
- Mm.

46
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:36,105
Douglas.

47
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:38,115
Mm-hmm?

48
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:40,176
You know,
they can't see me here.

49
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:42,186
I know.

50
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:46,749
- I gotta go.
- Come on. Come a--Come here.

51
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:49,125
Seriously, stop kissing me.

52
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:51,158
Stop it.

53
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:53,204
I see you at the office.

54
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:07,539
Fatima...you came.

55
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:10,206
You waited.

56
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:13,517
Your CDs.

57
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:15,886
Get on.

58
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,915
Did you listen to them?

59
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,817
Yes.

60
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:22,827
They were okay.

61
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,435
You have the worst taste
in music.

62
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,434
Stop, Khalid.

63
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,300
We can't go this way.

64
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,735
It's a shortcut.

65
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:40,745
Khalid, I said stop.

66
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:46,676
My father has tea here
every morning.

67
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:51,848
You see him?

68
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:53,858
No.

69
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:55,418
Fatima.

70
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:56,953
Fatima, wait.

71
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,788
Fatima, wait.

72
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,657
I want to meet him.

73
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:02,392
I told you, you can't.

74
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:03,493
Has he called?

75
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:05,630
Only to yell at me.

76
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:10,736
We should run away, just go.

77
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:13,624
We have our studies, Fatima.

78
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:16,406
We have to be realistic.

79
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:19,876
Okay for you.
No one's forcing you to marry.

80
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:22,286
I just want to meet him.

81
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,223
He has chosen someone for me.

82
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:28,259
He has chosen.

83
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:30,428
He might like me more.

84
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,495
You don't know my father.

85
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:40,204
Daddy.

86
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:45,635
Daddy, did I wake you?

87
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:47,645
No, sweetheart.

88
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:51,441
Daddy, do you dream about me
when you're sleeping?

89
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:53,451
I dream...

90
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:56,179
about you...

91
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,047
and your mother...

92
00:05:58,057 --> 00:06:00,184
and your sister.

93
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:06,692
Fatima said you stop dreaming
when you get married.

94
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:11,094
She's wrong, sweetheart.

95
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,078
You dream all your life.

96
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,247
It's one of God's gifts.

97
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:18,505
Understand?

98
00:06:18,515 --> 00:06:20,638
- Give me a kiss.
- No.

99
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,305
- One kiss.
- No.

100
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:24,315
Only one.

101
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:33,883
After Fawal,
we have meetings...

102
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:36,185
with Saeed El-Dalizi,
Minister of lnterior...

103
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:38,821
Hamsa Reglori,
the head of defense.

104
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:40,958
Saeed's all right.

105
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,061
Reglori has a...a little bit
of a solophist back-story...

106
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,963
but he knows
which side he's on.

107
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:50,713
So, uh, this, uh, Fa-Fawal--
What's his name?

108
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:53,177
- Abasi Fawal.
- Abasi Fawal.

109
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:57,373
- So he's the hard guy?
- Yeah. I--I've never met him.

110
00:06:57,383 --> 00:06:59,575
You're the, uh, knuckle-dragger.
I'm the pen-pusher.

111
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:02,645
He'll be more your contact
than mine.

112
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:33,075
They overload these donkeys
and cause accidents. Chaos.

113
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:34,143
Tea, please.

114
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:36,153
Okay.

115
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:43,928
How long you been here?

116
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:45,521
Five and a half months.

117
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:49,016
It's just on the other side
of the square.

118
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:58,893
- Ahmid, what's going on?
- Accident, sir.

119
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:02,746
Fuckin' traffic, man

120
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:07,746
Out the back! Out the back!

121
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:00,404
Mr. Freeman.

122
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:08,812
I am sorry.

123
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:29,091
- Lee Mayers.
- Lee, it's Douglas.

124
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:30,993
How's Dixon?

125
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:32,328
He's dead.

126
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:34,670
Fuck. Where are you now?

127
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:36,198
At the hospital.

128
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:39,507
- Are you hurt?
- No. I'm fine.

129
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:41,003
All right, listen. You're gonna
have to step up for a while.

130
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:43,806
Fill in for Dixon. Report
directly to me. Understood?

131
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:45,816
Yeah, I understand.

132
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:49,187
Douglas, are you okay?

133
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,390
Yeah.

134
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:07,204
Corrine Whitman.

135
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,608
Yes, it is.

136
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:14,144
All right, go ahead.

137
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,619
What's his condition?

138
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:28,014
Has anybody contacted
his wife yet?

139
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:31,362
No. I will do it.

140
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:36,053
- Any claim of responsibility?
- What is it?

141
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:41,136
No. All right. I'm comin' in.

142
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,232
What's happened?

143
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:46,268
Suicide bombing over there,
and they got one of us.

144
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:48,906
Jesus. It's 2:00 A.M.

145
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:50,740
Yeah. Well, I'm sure they
arranged it...

146
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,875
just to spite you, honey.

147
00:10:57,723 --> 00:11:00,613
So he's Egyptian
with a green card?

148
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:02,726
Okay. When's he land?

149
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:06,096
Uh-huh.

150
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,166
Okay, do it.

151
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:13,235
I'm givin' you
the authorization.

152
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:24,907
Welcome to Washington, D.C.

153
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:27,643
Please follow the signs
to U.S. Customs.

154
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:30,680
All arriving passengers
must clear customs here...

155
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,182
before embarking
on connecting flights.

156
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:38,462
Please have your passports and
customs declaration forms ready.

157
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:42,758
Excuse me.

158
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:45,230
- Mr. Anwar El-Ibrahim?
- Yes?

159
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,096
Sir, we have
an emergency message for you.

160
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:49,131
- Would you follow us, please?
- What do you mean? What is it?

161
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:51,067
- Is it my wife? Is she all right?
- I apologize, sir.

162
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:53,627
They don't give us
any details.

163
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:05,485
- I got it.
- Okay, let's go.

164
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,378
19 dead, 75 injured.

165
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,212
El-Hazim have
claimed responsibility.

166
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:38,047
And the new guy?

167
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:39,715
Shrapnel in the neck.

168
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:41,350
He bled to death.

169
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,360
Damn.

170
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:44,920
Sir.

171
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,189
You have calls
from Corrine Whitman, CIA...

172
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:50,593
and Mr. Davis
at the U.S. State Department.

173
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,603
Give me Corrine first.

174
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:58,909
One dead American.

175
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,305
Where am l?

176
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:30,866
Rashid Salimi.

177
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:32,876
What?

178
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:34,937
Rashid Salimi.

179
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:38,383
No, sir.
My name is Anwar El-Ibrahimi.

180
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:40,876
Rashid is
an Egyptian national...

181
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:45,047
who's claimed responsibility
for today's terror attack.

182
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:46,282
What attack?

183
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:48,292
Why don't you tell me?

184
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:51,320
Look...

185
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,557
I don't know anything
about any attack of any kind.

186
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:57,827
I've been on a plane
from South Africa for 18 hours.

187
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,271
Is this your phone?

188
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:02,399
It looks like mine. Why?

189
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:08,139
- Numbers match.
- What numbers?

190
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,639
Rashid has placed several calls
to your phone...

191
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:11,740
over the last few months.

192
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,276
No, sir. I've never talked
to anybody named Rashid.

193
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:15,477
What were you doing
in Cape Town?

194
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:18,447
Why am I shackled this way?
I want to speak to a lawyer.

195
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:21,177
What were you doing
in Cape Town?

196
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:28,393
Attending a conference...

197
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:31,164
for chemical engineers.

198
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:34,129
I was invited by the South
African Fossil Fuels Foundation.

199
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:36,139
Who did you meet with?

200
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:39,743
List them.

201
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:43,313
Can I call my wife?

202
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:45,349
No.

203
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:09,531
These are all
well-regarded professionals...

204
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,541
in my industry.

205
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:15,604
Are you familiar
with bomb-making techniques?

206
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:17,614
What?

207
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:20,703
Have you ever constructed
a bomb?

208
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:23,186
This is ridiculous.

209
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:24,813
You've never
constructed a bomb?

210
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:26,823
No, sir.

211
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:39,869
Six years ago...

212
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:45,104
I, uh...I worked briefly on
a study commissioned by the ATF.

213
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:46,702
Nothing to do
with bomb-making.

214
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:49,171
Just detection, using
trace paper technology.

215
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:51,181
You can check it out.

216
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,283
Thank you.

217
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:55,852
We will.

218
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:59,523
The point is...

219
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:03,434
you have experience
with explosives.

220
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:07,265
There were ten of us
on that team.

221
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:12,314
It was for a government agency.
Have you arrested them, too?

222
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:13,696
Rashid Salimi.

223
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:16,426
I don't know anyone
named Rashid!

224
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:32,848
Where is he?

225
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:34,854
I don't know.

226
00:16:34,864 --> 00:16:36,860
I'm gonna call him.

227
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:45,694
You've reached Anwar.
Please leave a message.

228
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:47,763
Hey, it's us.
We're at Arrivals...

229
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:49,965
and we don't see you anywhere.

230
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:51,700
Maybe we got
the information wrong.

231
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:55,195
Call me back when you get this.
Okay, bye.

232
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:35,077
El-Hazim claimed responsibility
within minutes of the attack.

233
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:37,112
The incident took place
in a crowded square...

234
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:38,580
as residents
were heading to work...

235
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,517
leaving nineteen dead
and dozens more injured.

236
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:43,118
The fourth
in a series of attacks...

237
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:44,987
the bombing has once again
raised concerns...

238
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:46,588
that extremists
are targeting governments...

239
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:50,292
I need everything we have
on Al-Hazim Brigade. Okay?

240
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:51,760
I have been asked
to fill in for Dixon...

241
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:54,490
until a replacement
can be found.

242
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:01,571
Uh, I need a work-up on Fawal.

243
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:03,877
Uh, Abasi Fawal.

244
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:07,851
Okay.

245
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:18,387
I need a shirt.

246
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:20,856
- Are you okay?
- I need a shirt.

247
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:22,491
I need a shirt. I need--I need
you to get me shirt...

248
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:23,592
- Okay. Okay.
- okay?

249
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:24,760
Okay, I need a plain shirt...

250
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:25,861
- not a--not a shirt with stripes.
- Yes.

251
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:26,929
- I know what a shirt is, Douglas.
- Just a plain cotton shirt.

252
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,197
- Do you--Do you know
what I'm talk--Okay.
- Okay?

253
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:30,732
Okay. Good. I need a shirt.

254
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,302
And l--I need a--I need,
um...uh...

255
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:34,369
What? Gum?

256
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:35,571
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

257
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:37,581
Okay. Okay.

258
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:46,915
If Cape Town says he boarded
and D.C. says he didn't...

259
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:49,135
then one of them is wrong.

260
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:50,986
I'm sorry, sir,
but you cannot just get...

261
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:53,822
on a plane in one country
and not get off in another.

262
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:55,190
Now, you must have
some record of him...

263
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,393
arriving or transferring
to another airline.

264
00:18:58,403 --> 00:18:59,628
Yes.

265
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:02,436
Well, check again.

266
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:04,800
Is he asleep?

267
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,368
He wants you to read to him.

268
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:08,003
Can you do it?
I'm on hold.

269
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:09,404
Did you speak to the hotel?

270
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:13,919
They said they dropped him
off at the airport on time.

271
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:16,311
Everything will be all right.

272
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,980
He probably just missed
his connection.

273
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,990
He hasn't called.

274
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:26,429
Lina.

275
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:33,901
Dad, when is Fatima
coming home?

276
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:39,943
Finish your milk.

277
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:52,449
Please, Abasi.

278
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:55,438
Tell her you made a mistake.

279
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:59,121
It's not the same
as when we were young.

280
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:01,131
There are rules, Samia.

281
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:03,567
There are rules.

282
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:05,727
Look at my sister Layla.

283
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:08,228
She'll never marry.

284
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:14,477
Call her, Abasi.

285
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:16,672
Please.

286
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:18,407
For me.

287
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:19,808
I have called.

288
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:21,643
I've left a dozen messages.

289
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:22,911
She doesn't answer.

290
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:24,921
What can I do?

291
00:20:26,091 --> 00:20:28,457
Leave the egg alone!

292
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:31,386
Have you called your father?

293
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,396
Not yet.

294
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,066
I'm sorry.

295
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:39,594
Don't worry, it's nothing.

296
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:41,868
What have I done?

297
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:51,076
I'm proud of you
for standing up to him.

298
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:54,343
That's my taxi.

299
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:56,353
Please stay.

300
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:04,845
I want you in this apartment
by eight while I'm gone.

301
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:09,462
If my brother knew I was
leaving you here alone...

302
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,570
he'd kill me.

303
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:15,739
Okay?

304
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,111
See you in a few days.

305
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:28,277
We think it was an attempt
on Abasi Fawal.

306
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:31,113
Dixon was just wrong place,
wrong time.

307
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:34,182
If they got one of us,
that's a victory for them.

308
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:36,118
These are the latest of Rashid?

309
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,053
Three months after he escaped
the Jordanians.

310
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:41,790
They should've taken him out
when they had the chance.

311
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,925
So without Dixon,
who do we have?

312
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:46,529
Douglas Freeman, analyst.

313
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:47,763
Degree in economics
from Princeton.

314
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:50,265
Started out as a junior exec
in the oil business.

315
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:51,867
How long with us?

316
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:55,074
Since September 12th,
give or take.

317
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:57,205
Jesus.
He looks 12 years old.

318
00:21:57,215 --> 00:21:58,940
Do you think he can do this?

319
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,876
He's smart.
He's been getting close...

320
00:22:00,886 --> 00:22:03,745
with the ministers
of finance and interior.

321
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:06,081
He initiated the Madrasa
charity investigation...

322
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:07,649
that,
uh, brought in forty-four...

323
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:08,717
- al Qaeda fundraisers.
- Lee...

324
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:10,767
analyst is not a jackal.

325
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,164
We're spread thin.

326
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:18,160
Did you polygraph
the Egyptian?

327
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,170
Yeah. Came up clean.

328
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:22,798
Polygraph doesn't mean diddly.

329
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:26,123
Well, we always say that
when they pass.

330
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,679
Somethin' funny?

331
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,276
We lost someone today.

332
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:39,113
I traced him with Interpol,
Mossad, the Egyptians.

333
00:22:39,157 --> 00:22:40,215
Nobody's interested.

334
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:42,225
I'm interested.

335
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:45,662
Okay.

336
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:49,265
What do you wanna do?

337
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:52,810
We can't hold him here
indefinitely.

338
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:56,072
Put him on the plane.

339
00:22:57,442 --> 00:22:59,442
Yes, ma'am.

340
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,615
My grandma has
the middle floor. I'm on top.

341
00:23:53,498 --> 00:23:55,657
I don't want her
to find me here.

342
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:57,726
She's away for the week.

343
00:23:58,336 --> 00:24:01,897
I have a back way in.
No one will see us.

344
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,779
You okay?

345
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:41,511
My grandma's room.

346
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:45,181
Come.

347
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:03,549
Jeremy,
stop bouncing the ball.

348
00:25:03,768 --> 00:25:08,188
You know you're not supposed
to do that in the house.

349
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:10,765
Why can't I come with you?

350
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:13,468
Because you have school,
and you have tryouts this week.

351
00:25:13,478 --> 00:25:15,036
What's all this stuff?

352
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:16,438
These are my important papers,
Jeremy.

353
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:18,998
I need you to get off the bed.

354
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:21,324
Are you gonna see Daddy?

355
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:24,012
Yeah.

356
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:26,286
Why didn't he come home?

357
00:25:29,794 --> 00:25:32,020
He just had to stay at work
a little bit longer.

358
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,489
Jeremy, your food
is on the table.

359
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:36,499
I wanna wait for Mommy.

360
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:40,161
I'll be down in just a second.
Okay, honey?

361
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:42,171
Go on.

362
00:25:45,143 --> 00:25:47,168
Sorry. I just--I have a copy
of his green card...

363
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:48,203
but I can't find a copy...

364
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:51,868
- of his passport anywhere.
- Under my name.

365
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:56,293
Who is this man
you're going to see?

366
00:25:57,088 --> 00:25:59,383
He's a friend from college.

367
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:01,658
He works for a senator.

368
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,581
Like jasmine.

369
00:26:57,882 --> 00:26:59,774
Do you sell what you paint?

370
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,409
Some.

371
00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:03,683
I'm getting better.

372
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:11,086
No.

373
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:13,096
Those are just drafts.

374
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:25,041
That's you?

375
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:28,069
Mm-hmm.

376
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:30,079
And them?

377
00:27:30,682 --> 00:27:32,912
My brother and grandma.

378
00:27:34,886 --> 00:27:36,886
This is your mother?

379
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:39,288
She was beautiful.

380
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:42,382
You are the beautiful one.

381
00:27:47,265 --> 00:27:50,580
You and your brother
have the same eyes.

382
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:52,869
Where's he now?

383
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,140
Does he visit you?

384
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,267
No.

385
00:27:59,277 --> 00:28:01,277
Not anymore.

386
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:04,113
Are you hungry?

387
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:08,478
Come, let's go to the kitchen.

388
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:26,094
Saeed.

389
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:27,796
Ah, Douglas.

390
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:29,130
I thought today
you might not come.

391
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,032
Yeah.

392
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:33,368
- Do you want a cigar?
- No, thank you.

393
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:34,703
Tea?

394
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,713
Uh, please. Yeah.

395
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,575
Do you guys have anything yet?

396
00:28:40,585 --> 00:28:42,678
Not yet. You?

397
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,079
No.

398
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:46,089
I got it.

399
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:49,884
You know, you have
a new detainee on the way.

400
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:50,919
Egyptian...

401
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:53,555
lives in America.
He's a chemical engineer.

402
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,523
Yeah, I got
the cable last night.

403
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:57,533
- Who's observing?
- Me.

404
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:04,129
You're not a case officer,
Douglas.

405
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:06,709
Nope.

406
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,130
Maybe I can
finally use my gun.

407
00:30:09,741 --> 00:30:12,333
We've got 58 percent approval
after your statement.

408
00:30:12,343 --> 00:30:13,902
There's no reason
for him to hide.

409
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:15,603
It's not the bill
he's concerned about.

410
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:16,738
- It's the attachment, Alan.
- I know.

411
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:18,640
- Okay, there's a compromise here.
- Yeah. Obviously.

412
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,375
This bill's gonna get crushed
in committee...

413
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:21,409
if you guys
don't get behind it.

414
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:22,944
Yeah?

415
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:25,946
Um, damn. I got to go.

416
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,215
I'll talk to the senator.

417
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:29,352
Thank you. Thank him.

418
00:30:32,463 --> 00:30:34,988
Izzy, you're here.

419
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:38,196
Um...God, look at you.

420
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:41,229
You didn't tell me you're,
like, a hundred months pregnant.

421
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:43,198
Thank you for seeing me, Alan.

422
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:44,399
Yeah.

423
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:46,467
Well, let's get you off
your feet, all right?

424
00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:47,902
Okay. Yeah.

425
00:30:47,912 --> 00:30:50,271
You look
like you're about to pop.

426
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:52,173
Uh, something to drink?
Eat? Eat?

427
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:54,209
Uh, no. Just a bottle of water
would be great...

428
00:30:54,219 --> 00:30:55,777
- if you have that
- Sam, can we get
a couple of bottles of water?

429
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:57,679
- Sam, Izzy. Izzy, Sam.
- Hi.

430
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,881
- We got Senator Lewis.
- Bravo.

431
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:01,349
Right. Am I walkin' too fast?

432
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,184
No, no, no.
I'll get there eventually.

433
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:05,194
Okay.

434
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:07,188
You've done well for yourself.

435
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:09,238
I always knew you would.

436
00:31:09,734 --> 00:31:10,758
Thank you.

437
00:31:10,768 --> 00:31:15,330
So, uh, you married Anwar.

438
00:31:16,774 --> 00:31:19,038
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

439
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:21,882
What'd your father
say about that?

440
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:23,504
I'm sure you can imagine.

441
00:31:23,514 --> 00:31:25,514
Yeah.

442
00:31:26,484 --> 00:31:29,577
Thought about inviting you
to the wedding.

443
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:32,052
I probably
wouldn't have come.

444
00:31:35,126 --> 00:31:40,311
I--l, um, brought some things
that I thought might be helpful.

445
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:44,792
This is a copy
of his Egyptian passport...

446
00:31:44,802 --> 00:31:46,261
- Listen, Izzy.
- and his green card.

447
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:47,929
My guy at INS,
he got back to me...

448
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:51,132
and he assures me that Anwar
never entered the United States.

449
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:52,667
- The South Africans made a mistake.
- I need you...

450
00:31:52,677 --> 00:31:54,035
to take a look at this.

451
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:57,572
This is a copy of his
most recent credit card charges.

452
00:31:57,582 --> 00:32:02,451
He spent $70 on duty free
during his flight to D.C.

453
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:04,782
He was on that plane, Alan.

454
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,961
No!

455
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:49,102
I've got Jim Alderman
on the line.

456
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:53,161
Jim. Yeah, thanks
for getting back to me.

457
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:54,963
Listen. I'm sitting
on convincing evidence...

458
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,874
that El-Ibrahim
landed in D.C.

459
00:32:57,909 --> 00:33:02,074
He purchased something
in the in-flight duty free.

460
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:18,494
What did he say?

461
00:33:19,864 --> 00:33:21,923
Uh, nothing helpful.

462
00:33:23,868 --> 00:33:27,693
Sam, can you get me a minute
with the senator?

463
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:05,582
- Peace be with you.
- And with you.

464
00:34:21,926 --> 00:34:24,520
I thought you weren't coming.

465
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:50,586
Come.

466
00:34:50,688 --> 00:34:53,054
Sir, he's here.

467
00:35:29,727 --> 00:35:32,787
Douglas Freeman,
Abasi Fawal.

468
00:35:33,831 --> 00:35:36,493
Uh, sorry about Mr. Dixon.
Uh...

469
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:40,103
Definitely, they were after me.

470
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:43,035
Second time.

471
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:45,474
Second time. Please.

472
00:35:50,114 --> 00:35:52,114
Drink, my friend.

473
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,150
No, thank you.

474
00:35:56,921 --> 00:35:59,651
So Dixon
was replacing Simms.

475
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,016
Yeah.

476
00:36:02,026 --> 00:36:04,026
Yes. And now it's you.

477
00:36:05,062 --> 00:36:07,758
- Now it's me.
- Mm-hmm.

478
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:10,799
Please.

479
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:19,934
Almonds.

480
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:21,944
Good. Very good.

481
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:28,217
Um...

482
00:36:29,387 --> 00:36:30,745
Our questions.

483
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:32,755
Of course. Thank you.

484
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:37,624
Al Jazeera
is running footage.

485
00:36:40,464 --> 00:36:45,766
Security authorities
have confirmed 19 deaths.

486
00:36:45,803 --> 00:36:48,996
Most of the victims
are women and children.

487
00:36:49,006 --> 00:36:52,965
A tourist video
found at the scene...

488
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:55,560
shows the source of the blast.

489
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:08,921
In an email to the station,
El-Hazim has claimed...

490
00:37:11,662 --> 00:37:14,382
Why the hell didn't we get that?

491
00:37:16,033 --> 00:37:19,127
Call Abdou, I want a copy now.

492
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:26,809
So...

493
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:29,321
you're staying to observe.

494
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:34,347
I will ask your questions.

495
00:37:34,385 --> 00:37:36,777
But there will be no
suggestions, no interference...

496
00:37:36,787 --> 00:37:39,051
while I work. Understood?

497
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:43,217
Good.

498
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:48,028
The struggle against
the Zionist and the Crusader...

499
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:53,614
represents the decisive battle
between faith and infidelity.

500
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:56,505
Between good and evil.

501
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:03,376
The destruction of the infidel
and hypocrite is your sacred duty.

502
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:10,225
When you meet the Apostate you are
commanded to "strike the necks."

503
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:18,051
The Crusader
talks about freedom.

504
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:24,799
Jihad is the only path
to freedom.

505
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:27,696
Do not fear their bullets.

506
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,574
What can they do...

507
00:38:31,942 --> 00:38:34,536
but set your soul free?

508
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:37,604
On the Day of Judgment...

509
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:42,543
when you stand before
the Almighty God...

510
00:38:43,287 --> 00:38:45,287
and He asks you...

511
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:49,812
"Why did you not fight
for the cause of God?

512
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:55,376
"And for the oppressed. The men,
the women and the children?

513
00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:04,308
"What did you do
with the one weapon I gave you?

514
00:39:04,709 --> 00:39:06,734
"Your body."

515
00:39:08,112 --> 00:39:10,740
What will be your answer?

516
00:39:11,248 --> 00:39:18,416
Will you display the wounds
of martyrdom and walk through
the gates of heaven?

517
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:27,086
Or, will you hang your head
in shame and roast in the fires of hell?

518
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:32,667
Success is from God.

519
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:37,565
May the peace and blessings and
glory of God, the Almighty, be upon you.

520
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:39,575
Amen.

521
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:41,877
Amen.

522
00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:42,970
Praise God.

523
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,980
God is great!

524
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:28,390
S-s-sir?

525
00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:31,252
There's been
some kind of mistake.

526
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,721
Why have my clothes
been taken from me?

527
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:35,731
I want my clothes.

528
00:40:38,235 --> 00:40:41,629
No one has told me why I'm here
or--or what I've done.

529
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:44,614
I--This is crazy!
I want my clothes!

530
00:40:44,642 --> 00:40:48,068
And I want to speak
to a lawyer immediately!

531
00:40:48,078 --> 00:40:50,478
Yes. Yes, of course, you do.

532
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:53,882
I have just a few questions.

533
00:40:54,985 --> 00:40:59,217
If you answer honestly,
we can send you home.

534
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:04,218
Sir.

535
00:41:04,228 --> 00:41:07,925
Sir. Are you American?

536
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,393
I've lived in the States
for twenty years.

537
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:14,462
My wife is American.

538
00:41:14,505 --> 00:41:18,066
Her name
is Isabella Fields El-Ibrahimi.

539
00:41:18,108 --> 00:41:19,967
If you just call her--

540
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:21,977
You are Egyptian. Yes?

541
00:41:24,615 --> 00:41:26,615
You are Egyptian.

542
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:30,949
Yes.
I was born in Egypt...

543
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:34,315
but I came to the States
when I was fourteen years old.

544
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:36,250
I studied at NYU.

545
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,918
- I got my mas--
- Yes, yes, yes, yes.

546
00:41:37,928 --> 00:41:39,887
I have it all here.

547
00:41:39,897 --> 00:41:42,491
Your English is beautiful.

548
00:41:42,533 --> 00:41:44,325
What language do you speak
with Rashid?

549
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:46,293
I don't know who that is.

550
00:41:46,303 --> 00:41:49,163
I've never talked
to anyone named Rashid.

551
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:51,599
So how do you explain
these calls?

552
00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:53,200
- What?
- Hmm?

553
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:54,368
Um...

554
00:41:54,378 --> 00:41:57,506
Uh, it must be a--a mistake.

555
00:41:57,548 --> 00:41:59,573
Maybe it's a mix-up.

556
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:02,882
My name is "El-Ibrahim-ee."

557
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:07,789
But, um, sometimes
people call me "El-Ibrahim."

558
00:42:07,825 --> 00:42:10,150
But it's "Ibrahim-ee"
with an "i."

559
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,319
- With an "i." "Ibrahim-ee."
- So--

560
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:14,388
Yes. Very good.

561
00:42:14,431 --> 00:42:17,992
Rashid Salimi and one
El-Ibrahimi, with an "i."

562
00:42:18,002 --> 00:42:20,722
Don't tell me
he didn't call you.

563
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:23,969
All this info, it's lies.

564
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:27,902
I don't know.

565
00:42:27,912 --> 00:42:29,904
You never get calls from Egypt?

566
00:42:29,914 --> 00:42:31,914
No.

567
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:36,305
Yes. I mean, yes.
My--My family is in Egypt.

568
00:42:37,788 --> 00:42:40,714
- Then they call you.
- Of course, they call me.

569
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:42,724
Of course. What about?

570
00:42:43,594 --> 00:42:46,186
Little things.
Uh, family things.

571
00:42:46,196 --> 00:42:47,888
Like what? Like, uh...

572
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:49,757
Um, like...

573
00:42:49,767 --> 00:42:51,767
like my Uncle Yusef.

574
00:42:51,802 --> 00:42:55,932
He called, asking if NYU
is a good school...

575
00:42:55,973 --> 00:42:58,669
for his...for my cousin.

576
00:42:58,709 --> 00:43:00,709
Yusef who?

577
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:06,175
Yusef Abdul Hamid?

578
00:43:08,285 --> 00:43:10,285
Yes.

579
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:14,082
- Where is he?
- What?

580
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:17,925
Your uncle.

581
00:43:18,963 --> 00:43:21,193
Where is your uncle?

582
00:43:21,231 --> 00:43:23,190
Why?

583
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,175
Why do you want
to talk to my uncle?

584
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:29,871
My friend...

585
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:37,108
put yourself
in our position.

586
00:43:37,147 --> 00:43:39,638
A criminal named Rashid...

587
00:43:39,683 --> 00:43:43,449
has been on a bombing campaign
for two years.

588
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:47,448
In the last few months,
suddenly his explosives...

589
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:51,019
are more sophisticated,
more deadly.

590
00:43:51,061 --> 00:43:54,955
You are an engineer.
You have the chemical know-how.

591
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:59,860
We have direct calls to you
from a number linked to Rashid.

592
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:02,463
What are we to think?
You tell me.

593
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:04,532
What are we to think?

594
00:44:04,575 --> 00:44:06,575
It's a mistake.

595
00:44:07,878 --> 00:44:09,878
It's a mistake.

596
00:44:21,191 --> 00:44:23,191
A mistake.

597
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:30,324
What if I were to tell you that
we have a signed confession...

598
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:33,929
from one
of Rashid's lieutenants...

599
00:44:33,971 --> 00:44:37,665
that you have been aiding them
for more than a year?

600
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:40,940
Then...I'd say you were lying.

601
00:44:47,117 --> 00:44:49,117
Put him in the hole.

602
00:45:19,783 --> 00:45:21,993
Would you like some water?

603
00:45:29,593 --> 00:45:33,529
Come. I want
to show you something.

604
00:45:37,367 --> 00:45:38,659
They close the fool's hand...

605
00:45:38,669 --> 00:45:41,934
around this
pressure release trigger.

606
00:45:41,972 --> 00:45:43,972
Pull the pin.

607
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:47,302
It's like a hand grenade.

608
00:45:47,344 --> 00:45:51,041
You let go, it detonates.

609
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:54,174
If the bomber
changes his mind...

610
00:45:54,184 --> 00:45:58,052
they have a shooter
who will take him out.

611
00:45:58,088 --> 00:46:00,386
The hand releases.

612
00:46:02,493 --> 00:46:04,493
Boom.

613
00:46:14,004 --> 00:46:16,438
They make it like this...

614
00:46:16,473 --> 00:46:18,498
with nails and bolts...

615
00:46:19,409 --> 00:46:21,534
for maximum human damage.

616
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:27,011
This is what killed
your friend Dixon.

617
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:36,585
The work we do
is important, Douglas.

618
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,720
It is sacred.

619
00:46:38,762 --> 00:46:40,762
We save lives.

620
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:48,270
Dixon wasn't my friend.

621
00:47:07,925 --> 00:47:09,925
I let myself in.

622
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:11,652
Yeah.

623
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:13,687
- Do you mind?
- No.

624
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:26,500
- I gotta get cleaned up.
- No, you don't.

625
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,510
Yeah.

626
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:32,380
Come on.

627
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:41,356
I, uh...

628
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:45,193
Oh.

629
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:21,396
Douglas.

630
00:48:28,505 --> 00:48:31,963
Talk to me.
What happened today?

631
00:48:35,846 --> 00:48:37,846
It was a bad day.

632
00:48:41,151 --> 00:48:43,151
What happened?

633
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:07,801
That's him.

634
00:49:07,811 --> 00:49:08,969
You see?

635
00:49:08,979 --> 00:49:11,529
Heading right for me. The dog.

636
00:49:14,251 --> 00:49:15,909
Is someone trying to stop him?

637
00:49:15,919 --> 00:49:17,711
Wait, wait.

638
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:19,721
She's blocking him.

639
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:22,624
The gunshot...

640
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:34,103
Useless.

641
00:49:53,223 --> 00:49:55,223
Is it a boy or a girl?

642
00:49:57,294 --> 00:49:59,294
Oh, um...

643
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:02,497
We wanted to wait.

644
00:50:10,374 --> 00:50:12,499
Well, it sounds like
a law-enforcement issue.

645
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:13,867
Have you spoken to the FBI?

646
00:50:13,877 --> 00:50:16,437
Yeah.
They never heard of him.

647
00:50:17,114 --> 00:50:19,072
Hmm.

648
00:50:19,082 --> 00:50:21,908
I-l-I don't know how I can
help you on this one, Alan.

649
00:50:21,918 --> 00:50:23,310
All right.

650
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:26,312
What's your involvement
with this?

651
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:28,950
Uh, she is an old friend.

652
00:50:31,094 --> 00:50:33,358
- She outside?
- Mm-hmm.

653
00:50:33,397 --> 00:50:36,289
Uh, you want me to say hello.
I mean, I'd rather not.

654
00:50:36,299 --> 00:50:38,597
No, I'd rather you not.

655
00:50:40,971 --> 00:50:42,462
I got a question.

656
00:50:42,472 --> 00:50:44,264
Shoot.

657
00:50:44,274 --> 00:50:46,366
When the CIA decides
to move someone covertly...

658
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:48,841
who gives the order for that?

659
00:50:50,647 --> 00:50:51,872
Corrine Whitman.

660
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:53,882
Right.

661
00:50:55,252 --> 00:50:57,252
Thanks.

662
00:50:58,155 --> 00:50:59,479
She comes in here once a week...

663
00:50:59,489 --> 00:51:01,448
to brief the Senate
Intelligence Committee.

664
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:03,817
Now, Senator Hawkins
is on that committee. Okay?

665
00:51:03,827 --> 00:51:05,952
They have a relationship.

666
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,640
I need to be delicate...

667
00:51:13,937 --> 00:51:15,796
so let me do the talking.

668
00:51:15,806 --> 00:51:17,798
I don't want her to know
you're in the room, okay?

669
00:51:17,808 --> 00:51:18,965
- Okay.
- Okay?

670
00:51:18,975 --> 00:51:20,200
- Yeah.
- Izzy?

671
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:22,210
Yeah.

672
00:51:22,646 --> 00:51:24,646
Okay.

673
00:51:34,958 --> 00:51:36,249
Corrine Whitman's office.

674
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:38,185
Hello. Alan Smith,
Senator Hawkins' office.

675
00:51:38,195 --> 00:51:39,886
I need to speak
with Ms. Whitman.

676
00:51:39,896 --> 00:51:42,923
This is Todd Hamilton, Mrs.
Whitman's executive assistant.

677
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:45,025
Can I ask what this is about?

678
00:51:45,035 --> 00:51:47,094
Anwar El-Ibrahim.

679
00:51:48,872 --> 00:51:50,872
Please hold.

680
00:51:55,846 --> 00:51:57,704
Mr. Smith?

681
00:51:57,714 --> 00:51:59,606
Yes.

682
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:03,016
I'm sorry.
Mrs. Whitman is not available.

683
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:07,522
Generally, or to talk
about Mr. El-Ibrahim?

684
00:52:07,557 --> 00:52:11,892
Please submit your inquiry
in writing to her office.

685
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:18,627
What does that mean?

686
00:52:18,668 --> 00:52:21,261
CIA calls it
"extraordinary rendition."

687
00:52:21,271 --> 00:52:23,163
It started under Clinton.

688
00:52:23,173 --> 00:52:25,899
The agency wanted to be able to
move suspected terrorists...

689
00:52:25,909 --> 00:52:29,336
without having to formally apply
for extradition.

690
00:52:29,346 --> 00:52:31,605
Now, it's supposed
to be used...

691
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:33,540
only under
extraordinary circumstances.

692
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:36,810
But after 9/11,
it took on a whole new life.

693
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:39,446
Basically, the government
has authorized the seizure...

694
00:52:39,456 --> 00:52:42,115
and transfer of anyone they
suspect of being involved...

695
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:45,018
in terrorism to secret prisons
outside of the U.S.

696
00:52:45,028 --> 00:52:46,953
Alan,
Anwar is not a terrorist.

697
00:52:46,963 --> 00:52:49,122
- There's nothing extremist about him.
- I know.

698
00:52:49,132 --> 00:52:51,558
He coaches Jeremy's soccer team,
for Christ sakes.

699
00:52:51,568 --> 00:52:52,592
What do you mean prison?

700
00:52:52,602 --> 00:52:54,194
Okay, but there
must be some reason...

701
00:52:54,204 --> 00:52:55,228
why they would take him.

702
00:52:55,238 --> 00:52:57,238
What reason?

703
00:52:59,643 --> 00:53:01,601
Did Anwar ever apply
for U.S. citizenship?

704
00:53:01,611 --> 00:53:02,869
No.
But why is that important?

705
00:53:02,879 --> 00:53:06,109
He has a green card.
He pays his taxes.

706
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:08,516
Alan, you know him.

707
00:53:09,052 --> 00:53:12,112
In fairness, Izzy,
I barely knew him.

708
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:15,890
You knew him.

709
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:19,027
Okay.

710
00:53:19,296 --> 00:53:22,389
What I'm asking is that
the FBI checks him out.

711
00:53:22,399 --> 00:53:24,090
You have to promise me
they're not gonna find...

712
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:25,358
anything unusual.

713
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:27,794
A meeting he might have
attended, all right?

714
00:53:27,804 --> 00:53:30,730
A friend or an acquaintance
that's had some contact...

715
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:33,099
any contact
with an extremist group.

716
00:53:33,109 --> 00:53:35,574
Uh, like a mosque he attends?

717
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:39,776
Does he--
Does he even attend a mosque?

718
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:41,950
You knew him.

719
00:53:42,352 --> 00:53:44,352
He hasn't changed.

720
00:53:48,091 --> 00:53:50,091
Okay. I know.

721
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:52,727
I had to ask.

722
00:54:31,301 --> 00:54:33,301
Where were you?

723
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:35,362
Fatima,
what are you doing here?

724
00:54:35,372 --> 00:54:36,529
I was worried.

725
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:39,174
You can't keep missing classes.

726
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:41,409
I was busy.

727
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:44,804
You were busy.

728
00:54:44,814 --> 00:54:46,539
Don't.

729
00:54:46,549 --> 00:54:48,929
Are you seeing another girl?

730
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:52,145
No.

731
00:54:52,155 --> 00:54:53,747
Then where were you?

732
00:54:53,757 --> 00:54:55,382
- With Omar.
- Where?

733
00:54:55,392 --> 00:54:57,942
At his home. He has a problem.

734
00:54:58,762 --> 00:55:00,587
I am his friend.

735
00:55:00,597 --> 00:55:02,597
Friend.

736
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:08,636
I'm sorry.

737
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:13,141
I have to go.

738
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:14,668
Now?

739
00:55:14,678 --> 00:55:15,935
Stay here.

740
00:55:15,945 --> 00:55:17,945
No.

741
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:21,308
Please...

742
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:23,318
stay with me.

743
00:55:25,121 --> 00:55:27,121
I'm sorry.

744
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:41,728
Hello?

745
00:55:41,738 --> 00:55:43,933
Hi.

746
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:47,500
What did your friend say?

747
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:50,603
He's talking to somebody
very high up.

748
00:55:50,613 --> 00:55:53,673
He said
she probably knows something.

749
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,720
Nuru?

750
00:55:58,888 --> 00:56:00,888
Yes?

751
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:06,990
There's nothing I don't know,
is there?

752
00:56:08,631 --> 00:56:10,631
What do you mean?

753
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:14,081
I mean,
back in Egypt when...

754
00:56:15,772 --> 00:56:17,772
when he was younger.

755
00:56:18,608 --> 00:56:21,301
There's nobody
he would've known there with--

756
00:56:21,311 --> 00:56:23,311
What?

757
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:27,382
Nothing.

758
00:56:29,486 --> 00:56:31,750
- I'm sorry.
- Isabella.

759
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:35,148
I think maybe you
should come home...

760
00:56:35,158 --> 00:56:37,717
before you put
the baby at risk.

761
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:41,127
- We can do things from here.
- So tired.

762
00:57:22,739 --> 00:57:25,333
Why did Rashid call you?

763
00:57:32,015 --> 00:57:34,575
Why did Rashid call you?

764
00:57:38,354 --> 00:57:40,564
Give him an answer, Anwar.

765
00:57:43,893 --> 00:57:45,893
Give him an answer.

766
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:49,630
Leave us.

767
00:58:04,914 --> 00:58:06,914
What are you doing?

768
00:58:07,417 --> 00:58:09,417
It's not working.

769
00:58:11,955 --> 00:58:14,505
He's not giving us
any answers.

770
00:58:16,526 --> 00:58:19,120
If he gives no answer...

771
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:22,956
then that's the answer
you put in your report.

772
00:58:22,966 --> 00:58:24,966
"He gave no answer."

773
00:58:27,604 --> 00:58:29,604
Let me talk to him.

774
00:58:32,275 --> 00:58:34,275
I wanna talk to him.

775
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:45,920
Ten minutes.

776
00:59:09,612 --> 00:59:11,612
Are you the American?

777
00:59:14,417 --> 00:59:16,417
Uh-huh.

778
00:59:20,857 --> 00:59:22,857
Why are you here?

779
00:59:24,861 --> 00:59:29,491
Just explain the phone calls,
and we can all go home.

780
00:59:29,532 --> 00:59:32,865
Tell me what to say.
I'll say it.

781
00:59:40,209 --> 00:59:42,209
Do you have a family?

782
00:59:45,982 --> 00:59:49,722
I asked you a question.
Do you have a family?

783
00:59:54,457 --> 00:59:57,517
You son of a bitch,
why are you here?

784
00:59:59,629 --> 01:00:02,094
Won't you
take this off of me?

785
01:00:03,073 --> 01:00:04,731
You fucking coward,
why don't you--

786
01:00:04,741 --> 01:00:06,781
Explain the phone calls.

787
01:00:14,151 --> 01:00:16,191
Explain the phone calls.

788
01:00:18,355 --> 01:00:21,085
I--I can't.

789
01:01:11,374 --> 01:01:13,374
Is Fatima here?

790
01:01:18,115 --> 01:01:20,115
There's...

791
01:01:20,984 --> 01:01:23,109
There's a problem, Abasi.

792
01:01:26,590 --> 01:01:29,055
I don't know where Fatima is.

793
01:01:32,629 --> 01:01:35,094
But she was staying with you.

794
01:01:36,633 --> 01:01:38,633
I went away...

795
01:01:40,270 --> 01:01:42,270
Away for work.

796
01:01:42,772 --> 01:01:44,772
You left her alone?

797
01:01:48,778 --> 01:01:51,571
When was the last time
you saw her?

798
01:01:51,581 --> 01:01:53,106
Six days ago.

799
01:01:53,116 --> 01:01:55,116
Six days ago?

800
01:01:57,020 --> 01:01:59,060
She's been seeing a boy.

801
01:02:00,257 --> 01:02:02,977
She said he was a school friend.

802
01:02:03,293 --> 01:02:05,293
Just a friend.

803
01:02:05,729 --> 01:02:07,729
What's his name?

804
01:02:09,499 --> 01:02:10,790
I don't know if she's with him.

805
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:12,259
What's his name?

806
01:02:12,269 --> 01:02:13,293
Khalid.

807
01:02:13,303 --> 01:02:14,528
Khalid who?

808
01:02:14,538 --> 01:02:16,833
I don't know his last name.

809
01:02:20,877 --> 01:02:22,877
I'm sorry.

810
01:02:45,168 --> 01:02:46,426
This is Douglas.

811
01:02:46,436 --> 01:02:48,436
Douglas Freeman?

812
01:02:49,573 --> 01:02:52,599
That's right. Who is this?

813
01:02:52,642 --> 01:02:56,403
Corrine Whitman. Lee Mayers
speaks very highly of you.

814
01:02:56,413 --> 01:02:58,506
Oh, thank you.

815
01:02:58,548 --> 01:03:00,540
How are things progressing?

816
01:03:00,550 --> 01:03:04,145
Uh, he's not cooperating.

817
01:03:05,855 --> 01:03:08,405
Well, that's why he's there...

818
01:03:09,726 --> 01:03:11,726
so you can help along.

819
01:03:12,229 --> 01:03:16,394
I don't think that he has
any helpful information.

820
01:03:16,466 --> 01:03:18,627
Really?

821
01:03:18,668 --> 01:03:20,793
Well, I'm told otherwise.

822
01:03:20,870 --> 01:03:22,870
I understand that.

823
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:26,533
Is your opinion shared
by Mr. Fawal?

824
01:03:26,543 --> 01:03:30,946
Well, Mr. Fawal doesn't care
if he gets information.

825
01:03:30,981 --> 01:03:35,242
He-He-He-He'll just keep trying
to get information...

826
01:03:35,252 --> 01:03:36,409
whether he gets...

827
01:03:36,419 --> 01:03:41,774
- any information or not.
- Is this opinion shared by Mr. Fawal?

828
01:03:43,927 --> 01:03:45,819
No.

829
01:03:45,829 --> 01:03:48,161
No. I see.

830
01:03:50,333 --> 01:03:52,798
You're new to this,
aren't ya?

831
01:03:54,070 --> 01:03:56,195
This is my first torture.

832
01:03:58,775 --> 01:04:02,871
The United States
does not torture, Douglas.

833
01:04:02,912 --> 01:04:05,572
Let me tell you something.
This is how this works.

834
01:04:05,582 --> 01:04:07,474
You worry about getting
the information...

835
01:04:07,484 --> 01:04:11,745
and I will worry whether the
information you get is helpful.

836
01:04:11,755 --> 01:04:15,122
Okay? You focus on the job.

837
01:05:10,246 --> 01:05:12,105
FBI and Interpol
have nothing.

838
01:05:12,115 --> 01:05:14,040
He's been in and out
of the States a dozen times.

839
01:05:14,050 --> 01:05:15,375
Conferences, lecture tours...

840
01:05:15,385 --> 01:05:17,644
but Immigration has
never had a problem.

841
01:05:17,654 --> 01:05:18,878
Could he be dirty?

842
01:05:18,888 --> 01:05:20,580
Does it make any difference?

843
01:05:20,590 --> 01:05:22,549
Hell, yes. Who's this?

844
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:23,917
Sharon Lopez, I think.

845
01:05:23,927 --> 01:05:25,485
Mrs. Lopez, nice to see you.

846
01:05:25,495 --> 01:05:27,787
Thank you so much for your
support on the micro loan bill.

847
01:05:27,797 --> 01:05:28,822
My pleasure.

848
01:05:28,832 --> 01:05:30,757
Look, the only point
you need to make...

849
01:05:30,767 --> 01:05:33,660
is that he's disappeared without
any kind of judicial reviews.

850
01:05:33,670 --> 01:05:35,428
So, then you'd like
to go public?

851
01:05:35,438 --> 01:05:37,197
Absolutely.

852
01:05:37,207 --> 01:05:42,052
When this thing breaks, you'll
be on the right side of it.

853
01:05:42,479 --> 01:05:44,479
She's here.

854
01:05:48,718 --> 01:05:51,380
Alan, be nice.

855
01:06:01,164 --> 01:06:03,156
Ms. Whitman.
Sorry. Forgive the interruption.

856
01:06:03,166 --> 01:06:05,492
Alan Smith,
Senator Hawkins' office.

857
01:06:05,502 --> 01:06:07,834
Oh. How is the senator?

858
01:06:08,538 --> 01:06:12,465
Flush. Approval's over 60.
Not a contender in sight.

859
01:06:12,475 --> 01:06:16,002
Oh, view must be great
from there.

860
01:06:17,847 --> 01:06:20,607
I was wondering
if I might have a word with you.

861
01:06:20,617 --> 01:06:22,710
Oh.

862
01:06:22,752 --> 01:06:24,752
Of course.

863
01:06:26,790 --> 01:06:30,049
Um, I'm inquiring about
a constituent's husband.

864
01:06:30,059 --> 01:06:33,460
- Uh-huh.
- Anwar El-Ibrahim.

865
01:06:33,496 --> 01:06:35,855
Does that name sound familiar?

866
01:06:35,865 --> 01:06:38,698
No. I'm afraid it doesn't.

867
01:06:38,735 --> 01:06:40,735
Egyptian?

868
01:06:41,271 --> 01:06:44,399
- Mr. Smith?
- Yeah.

869
01:06:44,441 --> 01:06:47,700
I'm afraid that this is not
the appropriate time or place...

870
01:06:47,710 --> 01:06:49,569
- to have this conversation.
- No, I apologize...

871
01:06:49,579 --> 01:06:52,878
but, um,
I called your office...

872
01:06:52,916 --> 01:06:55,408
and I couldn't get an answer...

873
01:06:55,418 --> 01:06:57,277
and I don't really know
what I should do.

874
01:06:57,287 --> 01:07:00,085
Well, I gave you my answer.

875
01:07:00,123 --> 01:07:02,333
Name's not familiar to me.

876
01:07:02,892 --> 01:07:07,192
Um, what if the press
were to get a hold of this?

877
01:07:08,531 --> 01:07:12,892
They might say that a dedicated
family man, an NYU graduate...

878
01:07:12,902 --> 01:07:15,228
has been detained
without any charges...

879
01:07:15,238 --> 01:07:16,930
without access to a lawyer...

880
01:07:16,940 --> 01:07:19,732
- just swirled away to God knows where.
- Darlin'...

881
01:07:19,742 --> 01:07:21,801
before you launch
into your big speech...

882
01:07:21,811 --> 01:07:23,770
why don't you ask your boss...

883
01:07:23,780 --> 01:07:26,639
how badly he really does want
to stick his neck out...

884
01:07:26,649 --> 01:07:28,649
for a terrorist?

885
01:07:29,018 --> 01:07:32,010
Well, he might
for due process.

886
01:07:32,055 --> 01:07:33,913
Maybe I should have a copy
of the Constitution...

887
01:07:33,923 --> 01:07:35,923
sent to your office.

888
01:07:38,428 --> 01:07:40,978
What are you
taking issue with?

889
01:07:41,598 --> 01:07:44,624
The disappearance
of a particular man...

890
01:07:44,634 --> 01:07:47,184
or a national security policy?

891
01:07:49,806 --> 01:07:50,930
You have him.

892
01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:52,532
I didn't say that.

893
01:07:52,542 --> 01:07:54,669
Yeah. I'll say it.

894
01:07:54,711 --> 01:07:58,791
Mr. El-Ibrahim should be brought
back to the U.S.

895
01:07:58,982 --> 01:08:02,075
If he's guilty, try him.
If not, let him go home.

896
01:08:02,085 --> 01:08:05,230
Mm-hmm. Honey,
this is nasty business.

897
01:08:06,155 --> 01:08:09,082
There are upwards
of 7,000 people...

898
01:08:09,092 --> 01:08:12,425
in central London
alive tonight...

899
01:08:12,462 --> 01:08:16,022
because of information
that we elicited just this way.

900
01:08:16,032 --> 01:08:18,391
So maybe you can put your head
on your pillow...

901
01:08:18,401 --> 01:08:22,462
and feel proud for saving
one man while 7,000 perish.

902
01:08:22,472 --> 01:08:24,931
But I got grandkids
in London...

903
01:08:24,941 --> 01:08:29,776
so I'm glad I'm doing this job,
and you're not.

904
01:08:29,812 --> 01:08:33,771
Unless your grandkid
is Anwar El-Ibrahim.

905
01:08:35,118 --> 01:08:38,111
Let me get a copy
of the 9/11 Commission report...

906
01:08:38,121 --> 01:08:40,213
over to your office
in the morning.

907
01:08:40,223 --> 01:08:42,223
You sleep well now.

908
01:08:54,671 --> 01:08:56,062
Khalid.

909
01:08:56,072 --> 01:08:58,072
Smile.

910
01:08:59,142 --> 01:09:01,667
Wait, I want one with Fatima.

911
01:09:02,612 --> 01:09:04,737
Fatima. Come get in the picture.

912
01:09:04,747 --> 01:09:06,743
Smile.

913
01:09:06,753 --> 01:09:08,749
Brothers and sisters.

914
01:09:09,385 --> 01:09:11,425
Sorry to stop the music.

915
01:09:11,921 --> 01:09:14,811
I just need to make
a few points...

916
01:09:14,958 --> 01:09:17,518
before the march tomorrow.

917
01:09:18,194 --> 01:09:21,588
Remember, the streets
will be lined with police.

918
01:09:21,598 --> 01:09:24,396
We must remain calm.

919
01:09:25,868 --> 01:09:27,993
We will show the world...

920
01:09:28,605 --> 01:09:32,098
We will show the world
that we have had enough.

921
01:09:32,108 --> 01:09:34,367
That we won't take it anymore.

922
01:09:34,377 --> 01:09:35,735
Enough!

923
01:09:35,745 --> 01:09:37,745
Enough!

924
01:10:24,794 --> 01:10:26,152
Khalid!

925
01:10:26,162 --> 01:10:28,162
Khalid!

926
01:10:32,001 --> 01:10:33,292
Khalid!

927
01:10:33,302 --> 01:10:35,302
- Khalid!
- Omar!

928
01:10:35,338 --> 01:10:37,338
Omar!

929
01:10:54,123 --> 01:10:56,382
The boy's name
is Khalid El-Emin.

930
01:10:56,392 --> 01:10:57,784
Khalid El-Emin?

931
01:10:57,794 --> 01:10:59,919
I got it from the school.

932
01:11:00,329 --> 01:11:01,621
Father's in Paris.

933
01:11:01,631 --> 01:11:03,289
Mother's dead.

934
01:11:03,299 --> 01:11:06,699
His brother, Fadil,
had multiple arrests.

935
01:11:07,203 --> 01:11:09,203
We had him for a while.

936
01:11:09,839 --> 01:11:11,839
We let him go?

937
01:11:13,876 --> 01:11:16,344
He died.

938
01:11:26,689 --> 01:11:28,689
Where's the boy?

939
01:11:29,092 --> 01:11:30,983
We don't know.

940
01:11:30,993 --> 01:11:34,308
We're trying to find
an address for him.

941
01:11:34,363 --> 01:11:36,823
Then why are you standing here
like an idiot?

942
01:11:36,833 --> 01:11:38,558
Go!

943
01:11:38,568 --> 01:11:40,568
Find him!

944
01:11:40,837 --> 01:11:42,837
Move!

945
01:11:48,511 --> 01:11:50,806
Khalid, where are we going?

946
01:11:52,682 --> 01:11:53,873
Who is it?

947
01:11:53,883 --> 01:11:55,742
It's Khalid. They've taken Omar.

948
01:11:55,752 --> 01:11:57,752
Open, open.

949
01:12:00,056 --> 01:12:02,056
They took Omar.

950
01:12:08,197 --> 01:12:10,197
They took Omar.

951
01:12:15,104 --> 01:12:17,864
Go in the kitchen
and boil some water.

952
01:12:17,874 --> 01:12:19,899
So we can clean him up.

953
01:12:44,233 --> 01:12:47,293
You should not have
brought her here.

954
01:12:48,137 --> 01:12:50,797
What are we going to do
about her?

955
01:12:50,807 --> 01:12:52,807
Leave her out of it.

956
01:12:55,611 --> 01:12:57,603
I'm not going to her house.

957
01:12:57,613 --> 01:13:01,608
You've got to understand,
she is not her father.

958
01:13:05,488 --> 01:13:08,123
Then we will do it another way.

959
01:13:09,725 --> 01:13:11,384
They have Omar.

960
01:13:11,394 --> 01:13:13,252
They will make him talk.

961
01:13:13,262 --> 01:13:14,921
Over.

962
01:13:14,931 --> 01:13:16,931
It is over.

963
01:13:22,271 --> 01:13:24,271
Then...

964
01:13:25,007 --> 01:13:27,007
we must do it now.

965
01:13:32,682 --> 01:13:34,682
Remember your brother.

966
01:13:37,753 --> 01:13:39,948
Remember your brother.

967
01:13:45,061 --> 01:13:46,085
She called you?

968
01:13:46,095 --> 01:13:47,119
Yes, she did.

969
01:13:47,129 --> 01:13:48,988
She didn't like the way you
approached her in public.

970
01:13:48,998 --> 01:13:51,157
Well, she wouldn't return
my calls.

971
01:13:51,167 --> 01:13:53,887
Well, Alan,
she's not obliged to.

972
01:13:54,537 --> 01:13:56,095
You have a personal stake
in this...

973
01:13:56,105 --> 01:13:59,080
so let me show you
what she gave me.

974
01:14:03,346 --> 01:14:05,872
For a year,
NSA has been tracking calls...

975
01:14:05,882 --> 01:14:07,540
from Rashid Salimi.

976
01:14:07,550 --> 01:14:10,243
Last week, a number they say
was one of his...

977
01:14:10,253 --> 01:14:12,278
was tracked connecting
to a cell phone...

978
01:14:12,288 --> 01:14:14,288
registered to your guy.

979
01:14:17,526 --> 01:14:20,120
- Salimi called Anwar?
- Maybe.

980
01:14:20,162 --> 01:14:21,554
Maybe.
What do you mean "maybe?"

981
01:14:21,564 --> 01:14:23,055
Did he contact him,
or didn't he?

982
01:14:23,065 --> 01:14:24,824
I said maybe.
You know these guys.

983
01:14:24,834 --> 01:14:26,425
They give away
their cell phones.

984
01:14:26,435 --> 01:14:27,460
They switch numbers.

985
01:14:27,470 --> 01:14:29,829
He could have passed the phone
to somebody related to Ibrahim.

986
01:14:29,839 --> 01:14:31,839
We don't know.

987
01:14:31,874 --> 01:14:33,332
Or somebody passed it on
to somebody...

988
01:14:33,342 --> 01:14:34,367
who passed it on
to somebody.

989
01:14:34,377 --> 01:14:36,135
- Who knows, right?
- Yeah. Who the fuck knows?

990
01:14:36,145 --> 01:14:38,780
But there could be
a connection.

991
01:14:38,814 --> 01:14:40,239
Now, you wanna bet your career
on something...

992
01:14:40,249 --> 01:14:41,374
that could go either way?

993
01:14:41,384 --> 01:14:42,475
I don't.

994
01:14:42,485 --> 01:14:44,510
We got a bill
we're trying to get passed.

995
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:46,979
This business of yours
is just gonna muddy things up.

996
01:14:46,989 --> 01:14:48,948
You wanna be the guy
who never has to compromise...

997
01:14:48,958 --> 01:14:51,183
then go join
Amnesty International.

998
01:14:51,193 --> 01:14:53,486
In this business here,
to get things done...

999
01:14:53,496 --> 01:14:55,221
you gotta give,
and you gotta take.

1000
01:14:55,231 --> 01:14:56,689
You got it?

1001
01:14:56,699 --> 01:14:58,958
If we're gonna get
into a fight about rendition...

1002
01:14:58,968 --> 01:15:01,193
it's gotta be the right fight
at the right time...

1003
01:15:01,203 --> 01:15:05,793
and it's gotta be a watertight
case, and this ain't it!

1004
01:15:06,609 --> 01:15:08,609
But, listen.

1005
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:13,573
I knew Anwar.

1006
01:15:13,616 --> 01:15:17,382
Okay? He was a solid guy.

1007
01:15:17,420 --> 01:15:18,444
We'll, isn't that interesting?

1008
01:15:18,454 --> 01:15:21,781
That's exactly what they said
about Mohammad Atta in Hamburg.

1009
01:15:21,791 --> 01:15:23,082
You start
pushing this thing...

1010
01:15:23,092 --> 01:15:24,784
they're gonna scream
national security...

1011
01:15:24,794 --> 01:15:25,818
at the top of their lungs...

1012
01:15:25,828 --> 01:15:27,954
and you and I are gonna be
called bin Laden lovers.

1013
01:15:27,964 --> 01:15:29,822
You want that? I don't!

1014
01:15:29,832 --> 01:15:31,828
Back off!

1015
01:15:31,838 --> 01:15:33,834
I got a meeting.

1016
01:15:56,325 --> 01:15:59,300
- Good morning.
- Morning, Samantha.

1017
01:16:00,196 --> 01:16:02,196
Alan, Isabella's here.

1018
01:16:02,398 --> 01:16:04,323
Can I get you a hot tea?

1019
01:16:04,333 --> 01:16:06,373
No, I'm okay. Thank you.

1020
01:16:09,572 --> 01:16:11,597
- Hi.
- Hey.

1021
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:13,640
So, what's happening?

1022
01:16:14,944 --> 01:16:16,802
- Uh...
- What do you have?

1023
01:16:16,812 --> 01:16:18,837
Have a seat. Here.

1024
01:16:21,784 --> 01:16:23,784
Want some coffee?

1025
01:16:25,154 --> 01:16:27,789
No. I can't drink coffee, Alan.

1026
01:16:29,925 --> 01:16:31,925
That's right.

1027
01:16:33,396 --> 01:16:35,921
What is it?

1028
01:16:35,965 --> 01:16:37,965
What do you have?

1029
01:16:39,835 --> 01:16:41,835
Okay.

1030
01:16:42,271 --> 01:16:44,311
You need a lawyer, Izzy.

1031
01:16:47,710 --> 01:16:50,236
There is evidence that
Anwar has been in contact...

1032
01:16:50,246 --> 01:16:53,476
with a terrorist group
called El-Hazim.

1033
01:16:58,654 --> 01:17:00,654
What?

1034
01:17:01,323 --> 01:17:03,323
What evidence?

1035
01:17:04,493 --> 01:17:05,684
It's classified.

1036
01:17:05,694 --> 01:17:08,329
Classified.
What does that mean?

1037
01:17:09,799 --> 01:17:12,591
That means
that I'm the wrong person...

1038
01:17:12,601 --> 01:17:15,236
to be looking
into this for you.

1039
01:17:18,941 --> 01:17:23,844
Alan, I know everything
that you're doing for me...

1040
01:17:23,879 --> 01:17:27,109
and I'm sure
this must be hard for you.

1041
01:17:27,483 --> 01:17:28,974
I'm not naive.

1042
01:17:28,984 --> 01:17:30,643
Maybe I even expected the worst.

1043
01:17:30,653 --> 01:17:34,053
But please, please
don't let that happen.

1044
01:17:35,391 --> 01:17:40,052
Please don't be one of those
people who just turns away.

1045
01:17:40,062 --> 01:17:42,062
I'm sorry.

1046
01:17:42,765 --> 01:17:45,655
There's just nothing else
I can do.

1047
01:18:09,558 --> 01:18:12,023
What is it
they say he's done?

1048
01:18:12,862 --> 01:18:13,953
I don't really know.

1049
01:18:13,963 --> 01:18:15,963
You don't know?

1050
01:18:16,031 --> 01:18:17,456
Well, who does know?

1051
01:18:17,466 --> 01:18:20,059
Because I need someone
to look me in the eye...

1052
01:18:20,069 --> 01:18:24,234
and tell me exactly
what it is they say he's done.

1053
01:18:26,242 --> 01:18:28,403
What has he done, Alan?!

1054
01:18:30,312 --> 01:18:31,904
That's the name
of a lawyer...

1055
01:18:31,914 --> 01:18:35,441
who really knows
his way around Washington.

1056
01:18:35,451 --> 01:18:37,576
You should take it, Izzy.

1057
01:18:55,371 --> 01:18:57,371
Isabella.

1058
01:19:00,709 --> 01:19:04,770
Tomorrow at 11:00,
she'll be here.

1059
01:19:07,750 --> 01:19:09,750
Thank you.

1060
01:19:41,050 --> 01:19:42,308
Please.

1061
01:19:42,318 --> 01:19:45,685
Please! Please! God!
No more!

1062
01:19:47,756 --> 01:19:49,949
I want to know what else
Rashid is planning.

1063
01:19:49,959 --> 01:19:51,784
I want names.
I want addresses.

1064
01:19:51,794 --> 01:19:53,752
I want to know
about future attacks.

1065
01:19:53,762 --> 01:19:55,762
Do you understand?

1066
01:20:03,305 --> 01:20:05,305
I don't know.

1067
01:20:08,210 --> 01:20:12,943
If you died here today,
right now, who would miss you?

1068
01:20:17,186 --> 01:20:19,111
Your wife
would eventually remarry.

1069
01:20:19,121 --> 01:20:22,521
Your son would call
another man "father."

1070
01:20:22,858 --> 01:20:25,793
Why are you doing this
to yourself?

1071
01:20:35,404 --> 01:20:37,964
No, no. No, no, no, no.

1072
01:20:47,182 --> 01:20:49,810
Enough. Enough. Enough!

1073
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:04,523
This is my interrogation.

1074
01:21:04,533 --> 01:21:07,423
You observe, Douglas,
nothing more.

1075
01:21:08,037 --> 01:21:10,037
Put the gag on.

1076
01:21:18,714 --> 01:21:20,639
- Put the gag on.
- No. No.

1077
01:21:20,649 --> 01:21:23,008
No. No. No. No.
No. No. No. No.

1078
01:21:23,018 --> 01:21:26,852
Wait! Wait! Wait!
He contacted me a year ago.

1079
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:40,400
Who contacted you?

1080
01:21:44,273 --> 01:21:46,098
Rashid.

1081
01:21:46,108 --> 01:21:48,108
How?

1082
01:21:48,844 --> 01:21:50,844
He called me...

1083
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:53,680
on my cell phone.

1084
01:21:57,419 --> 01:21:59,419
What? What did he want?

1085
01:22:01,023 --> 01:22:02,047
Information.

1086
01:22:02,057 --> 01:22:04,218
What information?

1087
01:22:04,259 --> 01:22:08,389
Chemical composition
to increase explosive power.

1088
01:22:08,430 --> 01:22:10,456
- Did you give him that information?
- Yes.

1089
01:22:10,466 --> 01:22:12,191
Did you ever speak
with any of his aides?

1090
01:22:12,201 --> 01:22:14,201
Yes.

1091
01:22:34,456 --> 01:22:36,456
Names.

1092
01:22:50,506 --> 01:22:52,506
Did he pay you?

1093
01:22:58,213 --> 01:23:00,213
How much?

1094
01:23:00,916 --> 01:23:02,916
Forty thousand.

1095
01:23:04,453 --> 01:23:05,844
Where is the money?

1096
01:23:05,854 --> 01:23:08,046
I haven't received it yet.

1097
01:23:08,056 --> 01:23:09,381
When was he
gonna give it to you?

1098
01:23:09,391 --> 01:23:10,983
When I was in South Africa.

1099
01:23:10,993 --> 01:23:12,993
Why South Africa?

1100
01:23:14,763 --> 01:23:17,322
I didn't want
a large amount of money...

1101
01:23:17,332 --> 01:23:19,797
being wired to me in America.

1102
01:23:23,739 --> 01:23:25,764
Where is the money?

1103
01:23:25,808 --> 01:23:27,808
I don't know.

1104
01:23:28,510 --> 01:23:30,805
The courier didn't show up.

1105
01:23:37,453 --> 01:23:39,453
Names.

1106
01:23:42,825 --> 01:23:44,825
Names.

1107
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:41,140
Hey, it's the man of the hour.

1108
01:24:41,183 --> 01:24:42,474
- Congratulations, Alan.
- Didn't I tell you?

1109
01:24:42,484 --> 01:24:43,675
You beat 'em
on this one, huh?

1110
01:24:43,685 --> 01:24:44,843
- Yes.
- Congratulations.

1111
01:24:44,853 --> 01:24:46,411
- A great day for us.
- Did I tell you?

1112
01:24:46,421 --> 01:24:49,141
- You told me.
- Congratulations.

1113
01:24:53,629 --> 01:24:57,463
Come. I'm not going
to hurt you. Come.

1114
01:24:58,166 --> 01:24:59,358
Where?

1115
01:24:59,368 --> 01:25:01,928
To a bigger cell.

1116
01:25:24,226 --> 01:25:26,226
Come.

1117
01:27:12,334 --> 01:27:15,770
Do you know
what they will do to Omar?

1118
01:27:19,641 --> 01:27:21,641
Do you?

1119
01:29:43,919 --> 01:29:46,724
Douglas,
it's 5:00 in the morning.

1120
01:29:47,956 --> 01:29:49,481
What is this?

1121
01:29:49,491 --> 01:29:52,187
1990 Egyptian soccer team.

1122
01:29:53,195 --> 01:29:56,187
- I Googled it.
- Okay.

1123
01:29:56,231 --> 01:29:59,124
1990 is the year
Anwar left Egypt for America.

1124
01:29:59,134 --> 01:30:00,559
Those are the men
that he said were members...

1125
01:30:00,569 --> 01:30:02,093
of the El-Hazim Brigade.

1126
01:30:02,103 --> 01:30:04,398
It's a fucking soccer team.

1127
01:30:04,940 --> 01:30:06,531
This is why you've got me
out of bed?

1128
01:30:06,541 --> 01:30:08,541
To show me he's a liar?

1129
01:30:10,846 --> 01:30:14,372
He said that--that Rashid
paid him $40,000.

1130
01:30:14,382 --> 01:30:18,543
- Well, that's a big incentive.
- He makes $200,000 a year.

1131
01:30:18,553 --> 01:30:21,479
Why would somebody who--who
makes $200,000 a year...

1132
01:30:21,489 --> 01:30:25,653
risk his life and his family
for $40,000?

1133
01:30:26,728 --> 01:30:30,824
We have a saying.
"Beat your woman every morning.

1134
01:30:30,866 --> 01:30:33,671
"If you don't know why,
she does."

1135
01:30:37,405 --> 01:30:39,197
I don't know what that means.

1136
01:30:39,207 --> 01:30:40,832
If you don't have
the stomach for this...

1137
01:30:40,842 --> 01:30:42,500
then you should ask
to be reassigned.

1138
01:30:42,510 --> 01:30:44,842
Douglas, I can't help you.

1139
01:30:46,114 --> 01:30:50,024
We have a saying, too.
Do you know Shakespeare?

1140
01:30:50,151 --> 01:30:52,210
Of course,
I know Shakespeare.

1141
01:30:52,220 --> 01:30:54,479
"l fear you speak
upon the rack...

1142
01:30:54,489 --> 01:30:57,634
where men enforced
do speak anything."

1143
01:30:59,928 --> 01:31:01,928
Saeed.

1144
01:31:04,466 --> 01:31:07,659
In all the years
you've been doing this...

1145
01:31:07,669 --> 01:31:10,229
how often can you say...

1146
01:31:10,272 --> 01:31:13,832
that we've produced truly
legitimate intelligence?

1147
01:31:13,842 --> 01:31:15,842
Once?

1148
01:31:16,278 --> 01:31:18,644
Twice? Ten times?

1149
01:31:18,680 --> 01:31:20,105
I mean,
just give me a statistic.

1150
01:31:20,115 --> 01:31:21,139
Give me a number.

1151
01:31:21,149 --> 01:31:23,508
Give me--Give me
a fucking pie chart.

1152
01:31:23,518 --> 01:31:25,518
I love pie charts.

1153
01:31:26,888 --> 01:31:29,047
Anything. Anything
that outweighs the fact...

1154
01:31:29,057 --> 01:31:30,615
that if you torture
one person...

1155
01:31:30,625 --> 01:31:35,187
you create ten, a hundred,
a thousand new enemies.

1156
01:32:00,655 --> 01:32:02,782
What are you doing?

1157
01:32:02,824 --> 01:32:04,282
Those are his release forms.

1158
01:32:04,292 --> 01:32:05,317
Yes, I can see that.

1159
01:32:05,327 --> 01:32:07,367
I need you to sign them.

1160
01:32:08,863 --> 01:32:11,297
We brought him to you.

1161
01:32:11,333 --> 01:32:13,460
He's my responsibility.

1162
01:32:15,603 --> 01:32:18,323
Now I'm asking you
to sign those.

1163
01:32:22,744 --> 01:32:26,407
Do you know
what this will mean for you?

1164
01:32:35,290 --> 01:32:38,180
- Morning.
- Good morning, Senator.

1165
01:33:08,123 --> 01:33:09,748
- Shall we go in?
- Mrs. Whitman.

1166
01:33:09,758 --> 01:33:11,758
Yes?

1167
01:33:13,094 --> 01:33:15,824
My name
is Isabella El-Ibrahimi.

1168
01:33:17,432 --> 01:33:18,757
I'm sorry.

1169
01:33:18,767 --> 01:33:21,702
My husband
is Anwar El-Ibrahimi.

1170
01:33:24,773 --> 01:33:28,174
Please,
just tell me where he is.

1171
01:33:30,545 --> 01:33:32,270
Please just
let me talk to him.

1172
01:33:32,280 --> 01:33:35,740
I have no information
on your husband, Mrs. Ibrahim.

1173
01:33:35,750 --> 01:33:38,610
Ma'am, I have a son.
He's six years old.

1174
01:33:38,620 --> 01:33:40,278
What do I tell our son?

1175
01:33:40,288 --> 01:33:41,946
I'm very sorry
for your distress.

1176
01:33:41,956 --> 01:33:44,482
I wish I could help you
with your problem...

1177
01:33:44,492 --> 01:33:45,850
but I simply cannot.

1178
01:33:45,860 --> 01:33:47,585
My problem?

1179
01:33:47,595 --> 01:33:48,887
- My problem?!
- Young lady, if you'll just leave...

1180
01:33:48,897 --> 01:33:51,022
- your name and information--
- You have my name.

1181
01:33:51,032 --> 01:33:52,424
You have my home address.

1182
01:33:52,434 --> 01:33:54,125
You have my phone number.

1183
01:33:54,135 --> 01:33:55,660
- You have everything.
- Let's go.

1184
01:33:55,670 --> 01:33:57,797
You have my husband!

1185
01:33:57,839 --> 01:33:59,798
Please don't walk away from me!

1186
01:33:59,808 --> 01:34:02,072
Just tell me where he is!

1187
01:34:02,110 --> 01:34:05,910
- Ma'am.
- Just tell me he's okay!

1188
01:34:05,947 --> 01:34:07,806
- Ma'am.
- Just--Stop!

1189
01:34:07,816 --> 01:34:10,284
Take your hands off me.

1190
01:34:12,654 --> 01:34:14,654
God damn it.

1191
01:34:40,515 --> 01:34:42,515
Oh!

1192
01:34:44,219 --> 01:34:46,219
Are you okay?

1193
01:34:54,529 --> 01:34:56,827
- Hello.
- Hey, it's me.

1194
01:34:59,033 --> 01:35:00,058
Douglas?

1195
01:35:00,068 --> 01:35:03,728
I'm sorry to call you so early.
I need your help.

1196
01:35:03,738 --> 01:35:07,478
Okay, can you meet me
at my place in an hour?

1197
01:35:09,444 --> 01:35:10,602
Okay.

1198
01:35:10,612 --> 01:35:12,612
Thanks.

1199
01:35:27,095 --> 01:35:28,219
Hello.

1200
01:35:28,229 --> 01:35:30,229
Sorry to wake you, sir.

1201
01:35:30,665 --> 01:35:32,790
We have someone
who knows your daughter.

1202
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:34,800
Omar Adnan.

1203
01:35:34,836 --> 01:35:38,062
He was arrested
by the riot squad last week.

1204
01:35:38,072 --> 01:35:40,537
He knows where the boy lives.

1205
01:36:15,843 --> 01:36:17,843
Khalid?

1206
01:36:44,405 --> 01:36:46,497
We're releasing El-Ibrahimi.

1207
01:36:46,507 --> 01:36:48,717
Tell them I'm coming down.

1208
01:37:11,566 --> 01:37:13,566
Hey.

1209
01:38:10,958 --> 01:38:13,763
Put on the clothes.
We're leaving.

1210
01:38:19,233 --> 01:38:21,233
Put on the clothes.

1211
01:39:03,010 --> 01:39:05,010
Come on.

1212
01:39:47,755 --> 01:39:50,724
I do this in memory
of my brother.

1213
01:39:57,965 --> 01:39:59,965
Come on.

1214
01:41:41,402 --> 01:41:43,402
Wait.

1215
01:41:45,806 --> 01:41:48,399
Okay.
I want you to keep moving.

1216
01:41:48,409 --> 01:41:50,101
- I just want you to keep walking, okay?
- No, no--

1217
01:41:50,111 --> 01:41:52,069
Just keep walking.

1218
01:41:52,079 --> 01:41:53,104
You do what I say.

1219
01:41:53,114 --> 01:41:55,114
Keep walking.

1220
01:41:58,486 --> 01:42:00,278
I gave you
the release forms, okay?

1221
01:42:00,288 --> 01:42:02,313
They're signed by
the Minister of the Interior.

1222
01:42:02,323 --> 01:42:04,323
Now, open the gate.

1223
01:42:05,560 --> 01:42:08,025
- Mr. Abasi--
- Open the gate!

1224
01:42:56,377 --> 01:43:00,605
They overload these donkeys
and cause accidents. Chaos.

1225
01:43:00,615 --> 01:43:01,672
Tea, please.

1226
01:43:01,682 --> 01:43:03,682
Okay.

1227
01:43:11,058 --> 01:43:13,058
Ahmid, what's goin' on?

1228
01:43:13,094 --> 01:43:15,094
Accident, sir.

1229
01:43:16,263 --> 01:43:18,263
Fuckin' traffic, man.

1230
01:43:39,120 --> 01:43:41,120
Khalid!

1231
01:43:42,289 --> 01:43:44,289
Khalid!

1232
01:43:45,292 --> 01:43:47,292
Khalid!

1233
01:43:50,197 --> 01:43:51,622
Khalid!

1234
01:43:51,632 --> 01:43:52,657
Khalid!

1235
01:43:52,667 --> 01:43:54,667
Khalid!

1236
01:44:01,108 --> 01:44:03,108
Khalid!

1237
01:44:14,188 --> 01:44:16,188
Why is he stopping?

1238
01:44:27,068 --> 01:44:29,068
Please, he's my father.

1239
01:44:30,805 --> 01:44:32,805
Khalid, please.

1240
01:44:36,143 --> 01:44:38,143
Please.

1241
01:44:39,947 --> 01:44:41,947
Please.

1242
01:44:46,787 --> 01:44:49,255
He's not going to do it.

1243
01:44:54,195 --> 01:44:56,459
Take him out.

1244
01:45:03,971 --> 01:45:05,971
Take him out.

1245
01:45:16,550 --> 01:45:18,550
Khalid!

1246
01:45:21,222 --> 01:45:23,222
Khalid!

1247
01:46:09,703 --> 01:46:11,703
Let's go, huh?

1248
01:46:18,712 --> 01:46:21,180
Come on. Come on.

1249
01:46:50,878 --> 01:46:53,369
When did he die?

1250
01:46:54,248 --> 01:46:56,682
God's will.

1251
01:46:59,753 --> 01:47:01,753
When?

1252
01:47:05,626 --> 01:47:07,626
A week ago.

1253
01:47:10,731 --> 01:47:13,199
They were just children.

1254
01:47:54,508 --> 01:47:57,228
Yes.
Is this The Washington Post?

1255
01:47:57,645 --> 01:47:59,270
Yeah.

1256
01:47:59,280 --> 01:48:01,280
Yeah, I'll hold.

1257
01:48:02,049 --> 01:48:04,769
- Did you get that stuff?
- Yeah.

1258
01:48:10,691 --> 01:48:12,691
Thank you.

1259
01:48:16,196 --> 01:48:20,531
Yeah. Um, could you connect me
to Editorial, please?

1260
01:50:11,612 --> 01:50:14,587
Here's your passport
and green card.

1261
01:50:15,716 --> 01:50:17,877
Captain's name is Walna.

1262
01:50:17,918 --> 01:50:19,476
He'll take you to Malaga...

1263
01:50:19,486 --> 01:50:23,311
then you'll fly to Madrid,
connect to Chicago.

1264
01:50:24,758 --> 01:50:26,683
Don't talk to anybody.

1265
01:50:26,693 --> 01:50:30,943
Don't say anything
until you're back in the States.

1266
01:50:32,900 --> 01:50:34,900
Get on the boat.

1267
01:50:50,484 --> 01:50:52,484
Go.

1268
01:50:53,053 --> 01:50:55,053
Go!

1269
01:51:00,761 --> 01:51:01,952
What the fuck are you doing?

1270
01:51:01,962 --> 01:51:03,420
I just got a call
from the consulate.

1271
01:51:03,430 --> 01:51:05,430
Do you have him?

1272
01:51:05,599 --> 01:51:06,657
No.

1273
01:51:06,667 --> 01:51:08,659
What do you mean no?!
Where the fuck is he?!

1274
01:51:08,669 --> 01:51:09,693
Douglas, listen to me!

1275
01:51:09,703 --> 01:51:11,495
You are making
a big mistake here!

1276
01:51:11,505 --> 01:51:16,265
And whatever it is that you
think you're doing, stop now.

1277
01:51:17,778 --> 01:51:19,778
Douglas, lis--

1278
01:51:57,084 --> 01:51:58,609
I hear you.
I have to call you back.

1279
01:51:58,619 --> 01:51:59,643
I didn't know
if I should answer it.

1280
01:51:59,653 --> 01:52:02,628
It's all right.
I'm going to get it.

1281
01:52:11,932 --> 01:52:13,957
I don't want that.

1282
01:52:23,343 --> 01:52:25,343
Corrine Whitman.

1283
01:53:20,534 --> 01:53:21,992
Hi, Daddy.

1284
01:53:22,002 --> 01:53:24,002
Hi there.

1285
01:53:29,003 --> 01:53:30,003
