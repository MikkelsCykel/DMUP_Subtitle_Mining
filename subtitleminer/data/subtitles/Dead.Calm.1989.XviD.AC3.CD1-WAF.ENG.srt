00:02:28,438 --> 00:02:31,650
- Merry Christmas, Captain Ingram.
- Merry Christmas, Evans.

2
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:13,501
The police told you about the child?

3
00:04:14,502 --> 00:04:15,670
Yes, they did.

4
00:04:15,921 --> 00:04:19,507
I'm very sorry, but we'll need
a formal identification.

5
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:20,800
Yes, of course.

6
00:04:21,051 --> 00:04:22,677
I have to warn you...

7
00:04:23,595 --> 00:04:26,306
...most of the injuries were to the face,
I'm afraid.

8
00:04:27,724 --> 00:04:29,226
The police said...

9
00:04:29,809 --> 00:04:32,354
...that my son died on impact.
Is that correct?

10
00:04:32,562 --> 00:04:33,813
Not quite.

11
00:04:34,648 --> 00:04:36,816
Just after the ambulance arrived.

12
00:04:37,275 --> 00:04:39,444
- How long was that?
- He was unconscious.

13
00:04:39,653 --> 00:04:41,112
He wasn't aware of any pain.

14
00:04:41,321 --> 00:04:42,948
How long, Doctor?

15
00:04:43,615 --> 00:04:45,325
Twenty minutes.

16
00:04:51,957 --> 00:04:54,417
- Have you ordered x-rays?
- They're on their way.

17
00:04:56,002 --> 00:04:58,880
She'll need an urgent CT scan.

18
00:05:00,632 --> 00:05:02,551
Decerebrate response?

19
00:05:02,968 --> 00:05:04,386
It's her husband.

20
00:05:07,889 --> 00:05:09,808
I want you to talk to her.

21
00:05:14,646 --> 00:05:16,189
Rae, it's John.

22
00:05:21,778 --> 00:05:23,113
Try it again.

23
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,323
Rae, it's me.

24
00:05:27,158 --> 00:05:28,827
It's John, Rae.

25
00:05:37,002 --> 00:05:41,172
"Down came the rain
And washed poor Wincy out

26
00:05:42,299 --> 00:05:44,759
"Out came the sunshine

00:05:44,926 --> 00:05:46,678

"Crawled up the spout again"

30
00:05:53,351 --> 00:05:55,270
That's a funny one.

31
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:57,480
Will you try it with Mummy now?

32
00:05:57,856 --> 00:05:58,940
No.

33
00:05:59,357 --> 00:06:00,859
Come on.

34
00:06:02,235 --> 00:06:06,364
"Incy-Wincy spider

40
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,720
"And dried up all the rain"

41
00:06:29,512 --> 00:06:33,016
- Danny, darling, get back in your seat.
- I've got him.

42
00:06:33,225 --> 00:06:34,851
I saved him.

43
00:06:50,617 --> 00:06:52,160
No!

44
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:54,371
No!

45
00:06:57,541 --> 00:06:59,626
It's okay. It's all right.

46
00:07:04,923 --> 00:07:06,258
I was holding him!

47
00:07:06,424 --> 00:07:08,343
I know, I know.

48
00:07:09,302 --> 00:07:11,096
John, I could smell his head.

49
00:07:11,263 --> 00:07:12,514
Stop it, Rae. Stop it.

50
00:07:12,722 --> 00:07:14,808
No, I can't!

51
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,978
I'm so scared.

52
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:22,524
I'm so scared.

53
00:07:22,732 --> 00:07:25,694
He's gone. He's gone, baby.

54
00:07:25,902 --> 00:07:27,946
We can never get him back.

55
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,617
It's gonna take a long time.

56
00:07:34,369 --> 00:07:36,580
Now, you know that. They warned us.

57
00:07:38,081 --> 00:07:39,791
Let's go home.

58
00:07:40,792 --> 00:07:43,003
- Please?
- It'll be worse there.

59
00:07:43,211 --> 00:07:46,089
- I don't think I can get rid of it.
- Yes, you can.

60
00:07:46,298 --> 00:07:47,716
No, I can't.

61
00:07:48,133 --> 00:07:49,843
Don't say that.

62
00:07:50,051 --> 00:07:51,428
Now look.

63
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,391
We've got weeks and weeks.

64
00:07:57,392 --> 00:08:00,312
Calm days, calm seas.

65
00:08:00,645 --> 00:08:02,898
Now, we're gonna get strong.

66
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:05,317
And when you're strong...

67
00:08:05,525 --> 00:08:08,653
...then we'll go home and we'll start again.

68
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,322
Won't we, Rae?

69
00:08:11,781 --> 00:08:14,326
Say it, Rae. Won't we?

70
00:08:17,787 --> 00:08:20,165
Say it, Rae. Won't we?

71
00:08:59,496 --> 00:09:00,872
What's wrong, Ben?

72
00:09:24,104 --> 00:09:25,438
Come on, mate.

73
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:46,418
What was it?

74
00:09:47,294 --> 00:09:49,087
It's nothing. Just the dawn.

75
00:09:49,588 --> 00:09:51,339
Is there any wind?

76
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:55,260
Not a whisper.

77
00:10:47,145 --> 00:10:48,146
So...

78
00:10:48,605 --> 00:10:50,440
...what day is it today?

79
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:54,402
Thursday or Friday.
One of those days with an "R" in it.

80
00:10:58,323 --> 00:10:59,908
Look at that.

81
00:11:00,825 --> 00:11:02,869
First boat in three weeks.

82
00:11:10,293 --> 00:11:12,921
She's been through some weather,
that's for sure.

83
00:11:13,797 --> 00:11:15,632
Is there anybody on deck?

84
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,676
Not that I can see.

85
00:11:17,842 --> 00:11:19,094
I'll call them up.

86
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,680
Do you have to?

87
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:24,015
I like it like this.

88
00:11:24,516 --> 00:11:26,226
Just the two of us.

89
00:11:26,643 --> 00:11:28,019
So do I.

90
00:11:29,604 --> 00:11:31,064
But look at her, Rae.

91
00:11:32,107 --> 00:11:33,858
That boat's in trouble.

92
00:11:56,548 --> 00:11:59,384
Black schooner to my east.

93
00:11:59,551 --> 00:12:03,054
This is yacht Saracen, Victor Kilo 2-7-6-2.

94
00:12:03,221 --> 00:12:08,059
Position 16-16 south, 176-47 west.

95
00:12:08,268 --> 00:12:10,186
Do you read me? Over.

96
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,271
John!

97
00:12:59,736 --> 00:13:00,737
John!

98
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:06,284
I thought I saw something
between here and the boat.

99
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,411
What is it? A turtle?

100
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,206
No. It's bigger.

101
00:13:18,421 --> 00:13:20,465
- You see anything?
- Not yet. Hold on.

102
00:13:23,134 --> 00:13:24,511
There it is.

103
00:13:25,929 --> 00:13:27,347
It's a dinghy.

104
00:13:28,306 --> 00:13:29,307
Adrift?

105
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:32,060
No, there's a man in it.

106
00:14:17,272 --> 00:14:20,191
Save it! We'll drop down to you!

107
00:14:28,074 --> 00:14:30,452
You hear me? Ship your oars!

108
00:14:30,869 --> 00:14:32,370
Get the fender, darling.

109
00:14:35,248 --> 00:14:36,166
Stand off!

110
00:14:43,548 --> 00:14:44,883
Take it easy.

111
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:17,249
Get him some water, darling.
Not too much.

112
00:15:19,334 --> 00:15:21,336
- Here you are.
- Thanks.

113
00:15:26,716 --> 00:15:28,176
My name is Hughie Warriner.

114
00:15:31,054 --> 00:15:33,223
John Ingram. My wife, Rae.

115
00:15:34,766 --> 00:15:38,436
I'm 32 days outward bound from Papeete.
I'm heading for Fiji.

116
00:15:41,606 --> 00:15:43,858
I only bought her about three months ago.

117
00:15:44,442 --> 00:15:48,989
My plan had been to cruise around
the Pacific, to sail around the Pacific.

118
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:51,324
Who would have thought, right?

119
00:15:51,616 --> 00:15:52,951
What's your trouble?

120
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:55,704
Trouble is she's going down,
that's the trouble.

121
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,540
She's not gonna last the morning.

122
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:00,625
Are you sure?

123
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,878
Yeah, she opened up all over.

124
00:16:04,504 --> 00:16:06,214
Has the water hit your engine?

125
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:07,507
My engine...

126
00:16:07,757 --> 00:16:12,304
...the radio, the fucking bulkhead, galleys.

127
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:13,471
Everything.

128
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:17,601
My only chance was to try to reach you
in the dinghy.

129
00:16:20,979 --> 00:16:25,066
See what Mr. Warriner needs, darling,
and get him to bed.

130
00:16:26,192 --> 00:16:27,277
All right.

131
00:16:27,819 --> 00:16:28,987
Where are you going?

132
00:16:30,238 --> 00:16:33,158
Well, I ought to get over there.

133
00:16:34,075 --> 00:16:35,660
How many people onboard?

134
00:16:35,827 --> 00:16:38,288
Nobody. I'm alone. I'm it.

135
00:16:40,248 --> 00:16:44,294
You tried to take her across the Pacific
on your own?

136
00:16:44,836 --> 00:16:45,837
No.

137
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,176
There were six of us.

138
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:56,848
The others died 10 days ago.

139
00:17:00,518 --> 00:17:02,187
One by one.

140
00:17:02,687 --> 00:17:04,606
It all happened in a day.

141
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:30,215
What happened?

142
00:17:32,425 --> 00:17:36,346
Have you ever thought about how life
can hinge on the smallest thing?

143
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:42,894
I mean, ever since I was a kid,
I thought salmon was for cats.

144
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,230
Was it canned salmon?

145
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:47,107
Yeah.

146
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:54,948
At first we thought
it was the tourist trots...

147
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:59,786
...until Chantal looked at her hand
and said...

148
00:18:00,036 --> 00:18:01,830
...Picasso should have painted it.

149
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:06,585
It had seven fingers.

150
00:18:08,461 --> 00:18:10,005
Double vision, huh?

151
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:14,634
Sounds like botulism.

152
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:16,428
What's that?

153
00:18:16,928 --> 00:18:20,515
It's a lethal form of food poisoning.
It hits the nervous system.

154
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:24,436
Yeah, well, I tried everything.

155
00:18:25,353 --> 00:18:26,438
There's no treatment.

156
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:31,318
Not on a small boat there's not.
Not 1,200 miles from land.

157
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,163
When you're ready, Mr. Warriner.

158
00:18:48,543 --> 00:18:50,879
We better go and salvage your gear.

159
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:55,217
My gear? You're looking at it.

160
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:57,719
There's nothing to salvage.

161
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:00,555
Everything was ruined by the water.

162
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:03,308
There must be something.

163
00:19:03,975 --> 00:19:07,312
Give me a break.
I mean, you know what I had to do?

164
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:09,147
I can guess.

165
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:13,318
They've been dead for days!
You know what that does to a body?

166
00:19:13,526 --> 00:19:15,737
You've gotta try and stop thinking about it.

167
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,572
I mean, I...

168
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:22,285
Fuck, I can't go back. All right?
I can't go back there right now.

169
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,496
Ever.

170
00:19:32,295 --> 00:19:34,130
That's all right. I understand.

171
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:39,094
Why don't you go to bed
and get as much sleep as you can?

172
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:41,805
Thank you.

173
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:55,026
Look, I'm really sorry to ruin your day.

174
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:59,072
- Here?
- Yeah, straight ahead.

175
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:53,043
You all right?

176
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:54,586
Yeah.

177
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:55,962
I'm fine.

178
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:57,172
You sure?

179
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:06,056
Some interesting stuff here.

180
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:08,683
Listen to this.

181
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:13,271
"South Sea Island Cruise. Four young
women wanted for photo assignment.

182
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,191
"Must be attractive and broad-minded."

183
00:21:19,402 --> 00:21:21,571
You don't like him, do you?

184
00:21:23,281 --> 00:21:24,741
I hadn't thought about it.

185
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,494
John, imagine what he's been through.

186
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:30,121
I'm sorry, Rae, whichever way I turn it...

187
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,582
...I just can't swallow it.

188
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:34,251
Any reason?

189
00:21:34,417 --> 00:21:37,128
Not really. Just 25 years at sea.

190
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:06,449
I'm going onboard her.

191
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:08,076
You can't do that.

192
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:10,120
He's fast asleep. He won't even know.

193
00:22:10,328 --> 00:22:12,122
He will. He'll hear the engine.

194
00:22:12,455 --> 00:22:14,457
No, he won't. I'll take the dinghy.

195
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:17,085
Load the gun and keep it with you.

196
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:18,628
Are you serious?

197
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:20,881
Just do as I say, please.

198
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:40,692
Back soon.

199
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:41,943
'Bye.

200
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:53,371
Wait a sec.

201
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:57,417
Go on, take it.

202
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:12,766
One, two...

203
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:24,319
Okay.

204
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:26,238
Go!

205
00:23:31,826 --> 00:23:32,994
Bring it back. Come on.

206
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:23,790
Rae!

207
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:29,880
Rae, I'm sick! I got to use the bathroom!

208
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:33,174
Rae, I'm nauseated! Please!

209
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:38,638
I don't want to throw up in here!

210
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:40,974
Rae!

211
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:13,043
Jump, Rae! Jump!

212
00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:16,213
Jump!

213
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:19,674
No! What are you doing?

214
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,014
No!

215
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:06,680
Jump, Rae! Jump!

216
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:16,064
Get off, Rae!

217
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:17,899
Leave it!

218
00:34:17,264 --> 00:34:18,348
Ben.

219
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:07,606
Where's John?

220
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:15,697
Now, what?

221
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:17,949
John, my husband.

222
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:21,870
Where is he?

223
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:24,456
He's gone.

224
00:35:29,002 --> 00:35:30,587
What have you done to him?

225
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:34,090
Nothing.

226
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:36,509
He went onboard her.

227
00:35:38,178 --> 00:35:39,554
We've gotta go back.

228
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:42,807
He's only got himself to blame, right?

229
00:35:43,016 --> 00:35:44,976
I mean, he should've trusted me.

230
00:35:45,227 --> 00:35:47,771
But that's always been my problem.

231
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:51,066
- Don't you understand?
- Please don't shout.

232
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:53,610
That's always been one of my problems.

233
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:57,072
I can never tell people's motives
until it's too late.

234
00:35:57,155 --> 00:36:00,825
Let's just turn the boat around.

235
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:05,205
Where shall we go?

236
00:36:05,455 --> 00:36:08,792
- Turn around!
- Look, you're being very aggressive.

237
00:36:08,959 --> 00:36:11,336
That could be a problem on this small boat.

238
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:13,922
I've seen it happen before. It doesn't work.

239
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,940
I was watching you
when you were sleeping.

240
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:36,152
And I gotta tell you
that your face fascinates me.

241
00:36:39,573 --> 00:36:43,201
Even when you're 80, Rae,
you'll still be a beautiful woman.

242
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:51,293
I studied art...

243
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,629
...for a time.

244
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:58,717
I found that painters,
when they approach their subjects...

245
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:02,971
...they always look at the face from behind.

246
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:05,849
From the back, to see what's holding it up.

247
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:11,354
And you've got magnificent bone structure.

248
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:21,281
"Magnificent."
Shit, that sounds like something...

249
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:23,283
...you'd say at a cocktail party.

250
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:27,454
Should have given you my card.

251
00:37:31,041 --> 00:37:33,710
I just knew we'd get along, didn't you?

252
00:37:40,342 --> 00:37:41,593
What's wrong?

253
00:37:43,553 --> 00:37:45,597
Would you just tell me one thing?

254
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,681
Sure.

255
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:52,354
I just need to know if that boat is sinking.

256
00:37:53,563 --> 00:37:54,814
Sinking?

257
00:37:56,233 --> 00:37:57,901
Well, past tense would do.

258
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:02,072
But, yeah. Yes, it is.

259
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:05,492
Why? Don't you believe me?

260
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:09,746
Yeah, I believe you. Of course I do.

261
00:38:09,913 --> 00:38:12,082
- That's why we've gotta go back.
- Back?

262
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:14,584
- To get John.
- You mean, back there?

263
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:17,879
Right now.

264
00:38:19,965 --> 00:38:22,676
No, Rae, no. Okay? That's over.

265
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:26,721
That's over. So let's erase that one
from memory and start again.

266
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:28,682
There's no going back!

267
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:31,643
No, don't say that.

268
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:33,270
He's gonna drown!

269
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:35,522
There you go! You're ruining it again.

270
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,440
That boat is sinking!

271
00:38:37,691 --> 00:38:39,109
That's not my fault!

272
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,862
What about those people?

273
00:38:46,116 --> 00:38:48,410
There wasn't any food poisoning,
was there?

274
00:38:54,124 --> 00:38:55,917
You want to do this now?

275
00:38:57,127 --> 00:38:58,461
All right.

276
00:38:59,296 --> 00:39:01,506
They tried to kill me, Rae.

277
00:39:01,715 --> 00:39:05,552
They tried to suck the light out of me,
if you can grasp that concept.

278
00:39:05,635 --> 00:39:06,469
Who were?

279
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:07,721
All of them!

280
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:11,558
Nobody wants to kill you...

281
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:12,601
What?

282
00:39:13,143 --> 00:39:14,477
Repeat that.

283
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:17,772
- I said, nobody...
- Say the words. Come on!

284
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:19,524
You mean I just imagined it.

285
00:39:19,608 --> 00:39:20,609
No.

286
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:23,987
I just meant it must be a mistake.

287
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,156
A mistake? Lady...

288
00:39:26,323 --> 00:39:29,492
The mistake is that you think
I'm making this up!

289
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:30,785
No, I don't.

290
00:39:31,161 --> 00:39:34,164
You sound so much like them it's scary!

291
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:38,335
Now, they were trying to kill me.
Do you understand?

292
00:39:42,005 --> 00:39:43,840
Yeah, I understand.

293
00:41:52,219 --> 00:41:55,680
Turn around. Don't look
at the bloody boat. Look at me!

294
00:41:55,889 --> 00:41:57,933
Okay, I'm sorry.

295
00:42:02,604 --> 00:42:06,149
What are you doing, Hughie? Go away!

296
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:11,488
- Okay, ladies, forget the home movie.
- Listen, ifyou turn around...

297
00:42:11,655 --> 00:42:13,531
...you'll get these incredible silhouettes.

298
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:16,910
When I want your advice on how
to take photographs, I'll ask you.

299
00:42:16,993 --> 00:42:18,703
Until then, keep your mouth shut!

300
00:42:18,787 --> 00:42:21,331
I'll remember that, but for now,
Russell, please.

301
00:42:21,498 --> 00:42:25,126
Lfyou move two steps to your left,
I can get you with the boat.

302
00:42:25,335 --> 00:42:27,796
We'll look at this someday and laugh.

303
