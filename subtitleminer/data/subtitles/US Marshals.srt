00:01:41,477 --> 00:01:42,937
This is Tow-6 to base.

2
00:01:43,354 --> 00:01:47,858
Hello? This is Tow-6 to base. Pick up.
Get your hand off the doughnut.

3
00:01:48,192 --> 00:01:50,778
- Hello, Tow-6, this is base.
- Thank you.

4
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:52,697
- How long to get back?
-15 minutes.

5
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:53,906
See you soon.

6
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:55,533
That's a ten-four.

7
00:01:56,784 --> 00:02:01,080
Hoffman told you? What the hell
are you doing listening to that idiot?

8
00:02:01,414 --> 00:02:04,125
You probably just cost this company
the whole account!

9
00:02:04,834 --> 00:02:05,751
Jesus, Mary...

10
00:02:43,164 --> 00:02:45,041
Hang in there. Help is on the way.

11
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:49,795
Hang tight.

12
00:02:58,137 --> 00:02:59,972
You're going to be okay.
Don't move.

13
00:03:06,145 --> 00:03:07,229
Can you hear me?

14
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:11,650
Easy, easy! Watch his left arm.
It could be broken.

15
00:03:12,068 --> 00:03:12,943
Careful.

16
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:21,869
Check this out.

17
00:03:30,628 --> 00:03:32,505
It was velcroed under the dash.

18
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:34,423
Thanks.

19
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:36,884
He had a gun.

20
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:00,741
Let's go back, then.

21
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:02,410
I ought to slap her.

22
00:04:03,035 --> 00:04:03,911
Big ass.

23
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:06,247
She was a bitch. A real bitch.

24
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:08,082
Tell me about it.

25
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,724
Fine, chump!

26
00:04:45,828 --> 00:04:48,122
Okay, kids, wake up.
I'm going inside.

27
00:04:53,836 --> 00:04:54,920
Kids, you ready?

28
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:56,797
Yeah, we're ready.

29
00:04:57,173 --> 00:04:58,966
We're going to knock on the door.

30
00:05:01,052 --> 00:05:02,511
Knock on the door, Biggs.

31
00:05:04,138 --> 00:05:05,056
Police!

32
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:07,808
Police! Freeze!
Don't even think about it!

33
00:05:08,059 --> 00:05:09,185
Get away from the gun!

34
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:12,188
What are you doing in here?

35
00:05:14,023 --> 00:05:15,191
Hands behind your back.

36
00:05:15,483 --> 00:05:16,859
Let her go, you moron!

37
00:05:17,443 --> 00:05:19,195
You're going to have to kill me!

38
00:05:29,372 --> 00:05:32,166
Hands in the air!
Against the wall! Do it!

39
00:05:46,931 --> 00:05:48,182
Get over there!

40
00:05:48,516 --> 00:05:49,600
Not my baby!

41
00:05:51,394 --> 00:05:52,978
Come here. Get over here.

42
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:55,898
- Freeze!
- My baby's crying.

43
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:58,901
Stay where you are. Freeze!

44
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:02,655
Just let me check on my baby.

45
00:06:02,947 --> 00:06:04,657
- Step away.
- Have a heart, man.

46
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:06,200
Get away!

47
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:31,851
Excellent work, young man.

48
00:06:34,854 --> 00:06:35,938
What a fight!

49
00:06:39,817 --> 00:06:42,903
Okay, Michael.
Regular or extra-crispy?

50
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,498
Damn, Michael!

51
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:55,916
I could've done that.

52
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,668
I'll need a tetanus shot.

53
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,962
Help me out of this chicken suit.

54
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:04,175
That's $ 120 more.

55
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:09,305
With the taxes Americans pay,
health care should be free.

56
00:07:09,597 --> 00:07:12,600
You got my vote, honey.
But you're still $ 18 short.

57
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:21,609
Marie!

58
00:07:25,446 --> 00:07:26,655
Mark.

59
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:29,200
Mark. What happened?

60
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,786
Don't worry.
It's not as bad as it looks.

61
00:07:32,203 --> 00:07:33,996
See? Legs still work.

62
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,874
But your neck, your arm.

63
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:41,212
I got a plate there from an old injury,
so they put that on as a precaution.

64
00:07:41,796 --> 00:07:44,840
I don't know what happened.
I'm driving the truck to base.

65
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:47,802
The next thing I know,
I was upside down in the cab.

66
00:07:48,511 --> 00:07:50,346
Then you were very lucky.

67
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,474
You have no idea.

68
00:07:55,768 --> 00:07:57,687
Officer Porter,
thanks for your help.

69
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,480
I'm sorry, you're under arrest.

70
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:02,775
- Is this a joke?
- This is no joke.

71
00:08:03,526 --> 00:08:06,278
Come on. We'll straighten it out
down at the station.

72
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:10,116
Hey, Cosmo.
This one's on me.

73
00:08:10,408 --> 00:08:11,701
About time, you cheap bastard.

74
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,869
- Only one.
- Then I'll make it a double.

75
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:17,498
As long as I live, if I never see Gerard
in yellow tights again...

76
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,291
...I'll die a happy man.

77
00:08:20,001 --> 00:08:22,712
Hey fellows, look.
Look, you're on TV.

78
00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:25,131
Look at us! We're on TV!

79
00:08:26,716 --> 00:08:28,342
We're on TV. Make it louder!

80
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:36,350
When he grabbed you by the throat,
I thought I'd take a dump.

81
00:08:36,642 --> 00:08:38,978
I did. I had to go change my underwear.

82
00:08:40,688 --> 00:08:43,858
Look at my head! 27 stitches!
All because of this scumbag!

83
00:08:44,108 --> 00:08:46,068
27 stitches, my ass!

84
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:51,991
The Conroys have made allegations
of excessive use of force...

85
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:55,536
...particularly against senior
Deputy Marshal Samuel Gerard.

86
00:08:55,828 --> 00:08:57,872
I don't look like that.
That guy's ugly.

87
00:08:58,414 --> 00:09:01,751
Nice suit. She'll have a martini,
and we'll take a check.

88
00:09:02,043 --> 00:09:03,419
- Who died?
- Shut up.

89
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:08,716
Reporting from the federal courthouse,
Stacia Vela.

90
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:14,180
Ladies and gentlemen,
the U.S. Marshals!

91
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,224
Ladies and gentlemen,
put your hands together...

92
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:19,143
...for the U.S. Marshal Service.

93
00:09:21,354 --> 00:09:22,563
Speech! Speech!

94
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:32,365
Noah Newman, Cosmo Renfro,
Savannah Cooper, Bobby Biggs!

95
00:09:33,199 --> 00:09:35,993
You guys are, without doubt,
the sorriest excuse...

96
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:38,120
...for a warrant squad
I ever worked with.

97
00:09:38,788 --> 00:09:40,247
But nobody got hurt.

98
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:43,709
It's probably important.
And you stayed close on the lead dog.

99
00:09:44,877 --> 00:09:47,463
- Which means you get to keep working.
- Get paid too?

100
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:50,716
A round for this group here,
and a double milk for this kid.

101
00:09:56,263 --> 00:10:00,476
Mr. Warren. We seem to have
a small discrepancy.

102
00:10:03,854 --> 00:10:04,772
Let me help you.

103
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:06,565
That's not me.

104
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:11,570
You caught that. You're aware it's
illegal to carry a handgun in Chicago?

105
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:14,407
Come on.

106
00:10:14,699 --> 00:10:18,244
You ever try towing a car on the
Dan Ryan at 3 a. m. without a handgun?

107
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:21,247
What about East 42nd,
1 st Avenue in New York City?

108
00:10:21,664 --> 00:10:23,958
- What about it?
- Ever been there?

109
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,168
Never.

110
00:10:27,503 --> 00:10:31,132
Then you wouldn't know about the double
homicide took place there last December?

111
00:10:31,716 --> 00:10:32,675
Obviously not.

112
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,928
That's interesting.
Because the prints we took off you...

113
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:38,472
...flagged this.

114
00:10:38,806 --> 00:10:41,767
Federal arrest warrant for Mark Roberts.

115
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:43,936
Prints from the crime scene
match yours.

116
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:45,521
This is bullshit.

117
00:10:46,022 --> 00:10:47,940
Let me talk to a lawyer.
Don't touch me.

118
00:10:48,232 --> 00:10:49,650
They got a lawyer...

119
00:10:49,942 --> 00:10:52,194
...for your extradition hearing!

120
00:10:52,445 --> 00:10:54,113
You're going back to New York.

121
00:10:54,363 --> 00:10:58,617
I've never been to New York! I don't
know nothing about a double homicide.

122
00:10:59,118 --> 00:11:00,202
Get him out of here.

123
00:11:00,453 --> 00:11:03,164
You'll have plenty of time
to explain that in New York.

124
00:11:03,414 --> 00:11:04,749
You got the wrong man.

125
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:06,334
Get him out of here.

126
00:11:07,752 --> 00:11:08,878
Thanks.

127
00:11:11,255 --> 00:11:15,217
- Warren. Mark Warren. What's going on?
- I don't know.

128
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:17,345
Why is it taking so long?

129
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:19,013
It's still being processed.

130
00:11:21,349 --> 00:11:22,683
Hold it there.

131
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:25,895
It's okay.

132
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,271
What's happening?

133
00:11:27,563 --> 00:11:28,856
Just a mistaken identity.

134
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:30,566
Where you going?

135
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:34,695
Just be cool, baby.
Everything's going to be fine.

136
00:11:52,463 --> 00:11:53,714
I'll be right back.

137
00:11:55,883 --> 00:11:57,843
Hello, Deputy.
I'm surprised you made it.

138
00:11:58,678 --> 00:11:59,679
Catherine.

139
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:01,764
This is Stacia Vela.

140
00:12:02,056 --> 00:12:05,351
This is U.S. Marshal Catherine Walsh.
She's the boss.

141
00:12:06,018 --> 00:12:09,522
Delighted. I've seen you so much on TV.
You're very lovely in person.

142
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:11,482
Thank you.

143
00:12:11,774 --> 00:12:15,695
You're welcome. I'm going to take Sam
away from you for just a minute.

144
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,781
Sure. I'll go and wait at the bar.

145
00:12:21,117 --> 00:12:24,996
Never one to be afraid of the obvious.
I admire that in a man.

146
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:26,622
Did I do something?

147
00:12:27,498 --> 00:12:31,419
You hit your prisoner while he was
in handcuffs. He could sue us.

148
00:12:31,794 --> 00:12:34,714
He bit one of my kids,
got smacked on the head. So what?

149
00:12:35,006 --> 00:12:37,049
- So what?“
- Yeah, so what?

150
00:12:37,341 --> 00:12:38,718
27 stitches is „So what?

151
00:12:39,719 --> 00:12:42,763
He needed a smack on the head,
he got it. What's the big deal?

152
00:12:43,681 --> 00:12:46,475
D.C. wants to take full advantage
of this Conroy bust.

153
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:50,604
You are going to personally escort
these clowns to the federal pen.

154
00:12:50,896 --> 00:12:53,524
You will give
a little speech to the press.

155
00:12:53,858 --> 00:12:55,609
You are going...

156
00:12:56,027 --> 00:12:59,739
...to do a nice little P.R.
song and dance and then...

157
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,699
...you are going to go fishing...

158
00:13:01,991 --> 00:13:03,451
...or something.

159
00:13:03,743 --> 00:13:07,371
You're going to take a vacation.
You're going to be happy.

160
00:13:13,878 --> 00:13:16,422
The plane leaves at midnight.
You be on it.

161
00:13:25,514 --> 00:13:26,640
Keep moving.

162
00:13:28,434 --> 00:13:30,311
Right over there. Let's go.

163
00:13:50,581 --> 00:13:53,167
Welcome to the unfriendly skies, Sam.

164
00:14:00,091 --> 00:14:01,008
72.

165
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:02,176
Check.

166
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:06,722
84.

167
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:12,186
36.

168
00:14:13,604 --> 00:14:14,647
Check.

169
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:28,744
Set your bag over here.

170
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:36,544
Look at the bright side.

171
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:37,712
We're on time.

172
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:48,180
Close up.

173
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:54,061
Lock it up.

174
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:00,776
All locked.

175
00:15:04,822 --> 00:15:07,408
Clearance, F-PATS 343, Memphis.

176
00:15:07,867 --> 00:15:11,871
Okay. It's on to Memphis and then
La Guardia, and we call it a night.

177
00:15:24,175 --> 00:15:25,926
Turn out the light. It's late.

178
00:15:26,218 --> 00:15:27,887
Be a couple of minutes.

179
00:16:08,761 --> 00:16:10,012
Got to use the can.

180
00:16:10,513 --> 00:16:12,431
You can hold it.
We got 20 minutes.

181
00:16:13,224 --> 00:16:14,600
I've been holding it.

182
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,519
I have to go right now.

183
00:16:17,395 --> 00:16:19,438
I'm serious.
I'm about to explode right here.

184
00:16:22,316 --> 00:16:23,234
Can he go?

185
00:16:25,027 --> 00:16:25,820
Yeah.

186
00:16:30,658 --> 00:16:31,659
7- C.

187
00:16:45,464 --> 00:16:46,841
All right, let's go.

188
00:18:27,066 --> 00:18:29,443
Split on ice. „
7 letters.

189
00:18:29,694 --> 00:18:30,486
Banana.

190
00:18:30,945 --> 00:18:32,488
No, bananas.

191
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:36,033
Bananas. Plural.

192
00:18:40,121 --> 00:18:40,955
Bananas.

193
00:19:19,076 --> 00:19:20,411
What was that?

194
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:23,122
Cabin pressure! Oxygen mask on.

195
00:19:26,584 --> 00:19:27,460
Sinking 2,000.

196
00:19:41,557 --> 00:19:43,225
Engine failure on 2 and 3.

197
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:45,770
Indy Center, this is F-PATS flight 343.

198
00:19:46,729 --> 00:19:48,314
We are declaring an emergency.

199
00:19:48,647 --> 00:19:49,648
Mayday, Mayday!

200
00:19:53,861 --> 00:19:54,779
Going through 240.

201
00:20:02,912 --> 00:20:03,704
13,000.

202
00:20:05,206 --> 00:20:06,040
I've got it.

203
00:20:06,874 --> 00:20:07,750
11,000.

204
00:20:17,677 --> 00:20:18,636
We're at 10,000.

205
00:20:19,929 --> 00:20:20,888
What was that?

206
00:20:21,722 --> 00:20:24,642
We lost engines 2 and 3.
A and B hydraulic failures as well.

207
00:20:25,309 --> 00:20:28,646
Look at your charts. See if there's
any airport we can make.

208
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,231
Nothing close.

209
00:20:30,606 --> 00:20:32,024
There's a road 20 miles ahead.

210
00:20:32,775 --> 00:20:33,901
That's it then.

211
00:20:34,151 --> 00:20:36,362
Indy Center, this is F-PATS 343.

212
00:20:42,994 --> 00:20:45,705
And still losing altitude.
We have lost 2 engines...

213
00:20:45,955 --> 00:20:48,624
...and we need to make
an immediate emergency landing.

214
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:50,668
Make the announcement.

215
00:20:50,918 --> 00:20:52,878
Brace for an emergency landing.

216
00:20:53,129 --> 00:20:55,923
Place your head between your knees
and brace for impact.

217
00:20:56,757 --> 00:20:59,051
Keep your heads down. Brace for impact.

218
00:21:08,019 --> 00:21:08,769
3,000.

219
00:21:11,814 --> 00:21:13,607
2,000 above ground. Sinking 1,500.

220
00:21:13,983 --> 00:21:15,443
I got the road.

221
00:21:16,819 --> 00:21:17,987
Okay, gear down.

222
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,293
1,000.

223
00:21:34,503 --> 00:21:35,921
500 above the ground.

224
00:21:38,007 --> 00:21:40,009
100 above ground. Brace for impact.

225
00:22:15,503 --> 00:22:16,796
Jesus Christ!

226
00:22:17,046 --> 00:22:18,089
Holy shit!

227
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:00,673
Oh, God.

228
00:23:00,965 --> 00:23:02,508
We're running out of road!

229
00:23:50,598 --> 00:23:53,100
Get down.
This man is unconscious.

230
00:23:54,018 --> 00:23:55,353
This man right here.

231
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:18,209
Get the weapons.

232
00:24:20,378 --> 00:24:22,046
All right, dudes, you're swimming.

233
00:24:28,427 --> 00:24:29,470
Clear!

234
00:24:34,392 --> 00:24:35,351
Mine didn't open!

235
00:24:47,613 --> 00:24:49,115
Give me those keys!

236
00:24:52,243 --> 00:24:53,411
Slow down! One at a time!

237
00:24:57,123 --> 00:24:58,124
Keep it moving!

238
00:25:00,292 --> 00:25:02,294
I ain't going in that water!

239
00:25:10,428 --> 00:25:11,178
Going somewhere?

240
00:25:12,555 --> 00:25:14,265
Hold that light on these shackles.

241
00:25:14,515 --> 00:25:16,142
I'll get this guy out of here.

242
00:25:17,018 --> 00:25:19,103
Play any tricks, our guys'll shoot you.

243
00:25:28,571 --> 00:25:30,906
- Stand up!
- I can't swim!

244
00:25:31,157 --> 00:25:32,199
Get out!

245
00:25:51,427 --> 00:25:53,012
We're going under!
Leave them!

246
00:25:53,596 --> 00:25:55,348
Leave the rest of them!

247
00:25:56,557 --> 00:25:58,517
Come on! We got to move out!

248
00:26:43,312 --> 00:26:45,648
Get your head up there, jackoff.

249
00:26:48,442 --> 00:26:50,194
A deep breath!

250
00:27:10,172 --> 00:27:12,508
Calm down! You want to live?

251
00:28:44,725 --> 00:28:47,019
They found the 2 that fell
from the plane.

252
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:51,941
That Chinese fellow dropped in some
poor old boy's roof and into the bath.

253
00:28:52,233 --> 00:28:55,653
- Looks like a bowl of gumbo with ribs-
- I get the picture, Sheriff.

254
00:28:55,945 --> 00:28:59,115
We still got one prisoner
unaccounted for.

255
00:28:59,407 --> 00:29:01,617
Mark Roberts. He was seated in 10-D.

256
00:29:02,827 --> 00:29:04,203
I guess the river got him.

257
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:07,665
No, the river didn't get this guy.
He's loose.

258
00:29:07,957 --> 00:29:11,377
If you can't find him dead someplace,
he's running, folks.

259
00:29:13,587 --> 00:29:15,089
We got a fugitive.

260
00:29:15,923 --> 00:29:20,261
Seems we might have ourselves a bona
fide federal fugitive out on the lam.

261
00:29:20,511 --> 00:29:22,888
Name of Roberts, Mark J.

262
00:29:24,265 --> 00:29:25,766
Somebody give me a map.

263
00:29:26,642 --> 00:29:28,644
- Who's got a map around here?
- I got one.

264
00:29:30,646 --> 00:29:31,772
Thanks, Earl.

265
00:29:40,531 --> 00:29:45,119
I want you setting up roadblocks,
general radius...

266
00:29:46,829 --> 00:29:48,289
...of 10, 12 miles.

267
00:29:48,664 --> 00:29:49,665
20.

268
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,711
He's got a real big head start.

269
00:29:54,837 --> 00:29:56,464
Okay, 20 then.

270
00:29:56,756 --> 00:29:58,215
That sounds good.

271
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:03,054
- In all directions, just like a big-
- Perimeter.

272
00:30:04,513 --> 00:30:06,098
Circle deal.

273
00:30:06,515 --> 00:30:08,768
Which should start somewhere near...

274
00:30:12,855 --> 00:30:13,773
What do you think?

275
00:30:16,817 --> 00:30:20,071
Said perimeter to extend downstream...

276
00:30:20,363 --> 00:30:21,405
...from Brookport...

277
00:30:21,864 --> 00:30:23,282
...to Mound City.

278
00:30:24,075 --> 00:30:26,535
Every bridge across the Ohio River
from Golconda...

279
00:30:26,827 --> 00:30:28,537
...to Metropolis to Cairo...

280
00:30:28,829 --> 00:30:30,623
...needs to be closed down.

281
00:30:31,207 --> 00:30:32,625
Extending south from Alexander...

282
00:30:32,875 --> 00:30:35,795
...and Pulaski county lines,
have every house, hotel...

283
00:30:36,045 --> 00:30:38,297
...hospital, back road and backwater...

284
00:30:38,589 --> 00:30:40,132
...searched for Mr. Mark J. Roberts.

285
00:30:40,383 --> 00:30:43,719
Get his picture on local television
and keep it there.

286
00:30:44,011 --> 00:30:46,347
Please consider him dangerous,
and please...

287
00:30:46,847 --> 00:30:48,307
...act accordingly.

288
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:55,398
Found a shoe. Looks like prison issue.

289
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:57,775
Okay. Continue to search.

290
00:31:00,069 --> 00:31:01,862
We found the place he came ashore.

291
00:31:21,924 --> 00:31:22,842
Jesus!

292
00:31:23,259 --> 00:31:25,845
Looks like the skies
weren't too friendly last night.

293
00:31:26,095 --> 00:31:28,848
- Sam used up 8 of his 9 lives on this.
- He's over there.

294
00:31:29,181 --> 00:31:31,475
- Where?
- It looks like he's in one piece.

295
00:31:31,767 --> 00:31:33,561
Sammy, how you doing?

296
00:31:34,145 --> 00:31:36,439
Think they got
a fat-free menu in this joint?

297
00:31:36,814 --> 00:31:39,275
- What are you talking about?
- Anyone else hungry?

298
00:31:39,567 --> 00:31:41,277
- I don't believe you two.
- Smells good.

299
00:31:41,527 --> 00:31:43,529
How can you talk about food
at a time like this?

300
00:31:43,779 --> 00:31:47,658
I wonder if they have
that vinegar barbeque.

301
00:31:48,326 --> 00:31:50,536
- On the French fries.
- On the meat, the fries...

302
00:31:50,828 --> 00:31:53,164
- It's big in England.
- It's big everywhere.

303
00:31:53,497 --> 00:31:55,541
- You all right?
- No, who's got my clothes?

304
00:31:55,791 --> 00:31:56,751
I do.

305
00:31:58,461 --> 00:31:59,253
Nice?

306
00:32:02,006 --> 00:32:02,923
I knew it!

307
00:32:03,215 --> 00:32:06,719
- Told you he wouldn't like it.
- I got the same thing last Christmas.

308
00:32:12,141 --> 00:32:14,560
Anybody got $9 so I can buy a T-shirt?

309
00:32:14,935 --> 00:32:16,729
You owe me $85 for this.

310
00:32:16,979 --> 00:32:18,856
I got one.

311
00:32:23,152 --> 00:32:26,113
State police found a shoe
over here near Hillerman.

312
00:32:26,405 --> 00:32:27,406
What do you got?

313
00:32:28,199 --> 00:32:31,494
Oh, boss, nothing, "nada".
It's like this guy doesn't even exist.

314
00:32:31,786 --> 00:32:34,163
- Is this food free?
- Eat up. It's on the County.

315
00:32:34,413 --> 00:32:36,916
He called himself Mark Warren.
I.D.s were forged.

316
00:32:37,166 --> 00:32:40,294
Mark Roberts ain't nothing but
a photo and prints on a warrant.

317
00:32:40,711 --> 00:32:42,296
- This is the guy?
- Cute.

318
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:43,923
Noah, you bring my gun?

319
00:32:46,842 --> 00:32:48,052
Cute, huh?

320
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:10,658
Where will I find
Deputy Sam Gerard?

321
00:33:11,409 --> 00:33:12,201
Here!

322
00:33:17,289 --> 00:33:20,626
Bertram Lamb. I'm director
of the Diplomatic Security Service...

323
00:33:21,043 --> 00:33:24,380
...State Department.
Special Agent Frank Barrows.

324
00:33:24,755 --> 00:33:27,591
- What's up?
- Mark Roberts.

325
00:33:28,426 --> 00:33:29,635
What do you know about him?

326
00:33:30,094 --> 00:33:31,637
Double murder, robbery, escape.

327
00:33:36,267 --> 00:33:38,227
These men were not ordinary civilians.

328
00:33:39,603 --> 00:33:42,648
They were my agents,
murdered by Mark Roberts...

329
00:33:42,982 --> 00:33:45,192
...in cold blood at the U.N.
last January.

330
00:33:45,484 --> 00:33:47,653
- That's not on his warrant.
- All information...

331
00:33:47,945 --> 00:33:50,656
...on this was sanitized
for reasons of national security.

332
00:33:50,906 --> 00:33:53,659
- Why'd Mark Roberts kill your guys?
- We don't know.

333
00:33:53,909 --> 00:33:57,830
All we have are his fingerprints at the
scene. We've chased him for 6 months.

334
00:33:58,414 --> 00:34:00,333
So we're working for you now, huh?

335
00:34:01,959 --> 00:34:03,002
That's not my intention.

336
00:34:03,586 --> 00:34:05,338
Your reputation precedes you, Deputy.

337
00:34:05,629 --> 00:34:07,715
We want you to continue
running the pursuit...

338
00:34:08,299 --> 00:34:09,842
...but we want Roberts fast.

339
00:34:10,176 --> 00:34:11,052
Okay, we're fast.

340
00:34:12,345 --> 00:34:14,513
We'll need to be kept
in the loop on this.

341
00:34:14,805 --> 00:34:16,515
We'll try to keep you up to speed.

342
00:34:17,016 --> 00:34:19,977
So one of my men will
join your team to do just that.

343
00:34:20,269 --> 00:34:21,479
Special Agent John Royce.

344
00:34:24,482 --> 00:34:28,861
No offense, but we actually work a lot
faster if we don't have any help.

345
00:34:29,111 --> 00:34:31,864
No offense taken.
You don't have a choice.

346
00:34:32,156 --> 00:34:33,949
I've cleared this with Marshal Walsh.

347
00:34:34,617 --> 00:34:36,160
Royce is one of our best men.

348
00:34:36,786 --> 00:34:38,120
You'll find him useful.

349
00:34:38,788 --> 00:34:39,955
Good luck, Deputy.

350
00:34:48,339 --> 00:34:49,632
How you doing?

351
00:34:49,965 --> 00:34:52,968
- If it's any consolation, I wouldn't-
- It's no consolation.

352
00:34:54,345 --> 00:34:55,930
- Take off your sunglasses.
- Why?

353
00:34:56,222 --> 00:34:57,598
So I can see your face.

354
00:35:00,851 --> 00:35:02,436
How'd you pull this duty?

355
00:35:02,728 --> 00:35:05,106
Your fugitive murdered 2 of my friends.
I volunteered.

356
00:35:06,148 --> 00:35:07,942
Ever make a fugitive arrest before?

357
00:35:08,317 --> 00:35:11,070
- No. Planning to shortly.
- You have a weapon?

358
00:35:11,821 --> 00:35:12,863
A big one. You?

359
00:35:15,992 --> 00:35:17,827
You sure you want
to get cute with me?

360
00:35:22,123 --> 00:35:24,125
- Got a backup weapon?
- Never had the need.

361
00:35:24,542 --> 00:35:27,294
Get one. Keep that in your suit
unless I tell you to take it out.

362
00:35:27,586 --> 00:35:30,297
Get a Glock.
Lose that nickel-plated sissy pistol.

363
00:35:30,548 --> 00:35:34,927
Let's move. I'm not having fun. You
know I get cranky when I don't have fun.

364
00:35:35,177 --> 00:35:36,429
We know, we know.

365
00:35:36,721 --> 00:35:38,806
Get the state police director
on the phone.

366
00:35:39,223 --> 00:35:42,393
Cooper, get the background
on the Chinese guy in the plane.

367
00:35:42,685 --> 00:35:47,314
Cosmo, get the local sheriff lined out
and ready to go. He's feeling weak.

368
00:35:47,565 --> 00:35:49,150
Working on it.

369
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,651
You come with me.

370
00:35:52,445 --> 00:35:53,654
I think he likes you.

371
00:36:06,542 --> 00:36:07,668
Martha?

372
00:36:09,128 --> 00:36:10,254
Just drive.

373
00:36:19,388 --> 00:36:22,725
- How soon can I get on that airplane?
- Soon as we get it on the barge.

374
00:36:25,936 --> 00:36:28,272
I got something on that shooter
in the plane.

375
00:36:28,564 --> 00:36:33,027
Name's Vincent Ling. He was on his way
back to the pen. Just lost an appeal.

376
00:36:33,277 --> 00:36:36,197
Serving a life sentence for murder
for a Chinese mob hit.

377
00:36:36,489 --> 00:36:40,910
Sheriff in Metropolis just found this in
a dumpster behind a laundromat.

378
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:45,873
All right. Our boy
got a new set of clothes.

379
00:36:46,248 --> 00:36:48,918
- Where's Metropolis?
- I don't know. Ask Superman.

380
00:36:49,168 --> 00:36:50,544
Shut up, Biggs.

381
00:36:51,128 --> 00:36:54,173
Get on the radio, move that perimeter
20 miles south of the river.

382
00:36:54,423 --> 00:36:56,509
He might've made it into
Kentucky already.

383
00:36:57,385 --> 00:36:59,970
Statistically, he's more likely headed
for a city.

384
00:37:00,262 --> 00:37:02,014
St. Louis. North.

385
00:37:02,306 --> 00:37:03,766
He's no statistic.

386
00:37:05,643 --> 00:37:06,686
Not yet.

387
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:46,517
Holy shit! Sammy, you're a lucky man.
How many dead?

388
00:37:46,809 --> 00:37:47,727
Eight.

389
00:38:08,164 --> 00:38:09,915
You got your little black box?

390
00:38:16,547 --> 00:38:17,757
Save that light.

391
00:38:20,843 --> 00:38:21,844
What's that?

392
00:38:31,562 --> 00:38:34,148
That is not a ballpoint pen.

393
00:38:34,565 --> 00:38:39,195
Zip guns aren't standard issue on
federal corrections prisoner transports.

394
00:38:40,112 --> 00:38:41,614
No, that's in those spy movies.

395
00:38:42,031 --> 00:38:43,616
I saw one on TV one time.

396
00:38:43,908 --> 00:38:46,661
- That James Bond movie.
- Shagadelic, baby.

397
00:38:46,994 --> 00:38:47,870
Shaft.

398
00:38:48,746 --> 00:38:49,997
Send it to a lab.

399
00:38:50,706 --> 00:38:51,832
Stinger.

400
00:38:52,083 --> 00:38:54,710
XL-17, Korean.. 22 caliber.

401
00:38:55,127 --> 00:38:57,463
He found it with his little flashlight.

402
00:38:59,131 --> 00:39:01,050
What the hell are you doing?

403
00:39:05,596 --> 00:39:07,890
That was my phone.
It was my personal phone.

404
00:39:08,182 --> 00:39:11,686
You're under arrest for obstructing
a federal investigation.

405
00:39:11,977 --> 00:39:13,979
- It's not convictable.
- It's arrestable.

406
00:39:14,271 --> 00:39:16,357
Are you crazy? Is this guy crazy?

407
00:39:16,899 --> 00:39:18,025
No, but he's a carrier.

408
00:39:18,317 --> 00:39:19,860
My superiors won't like this.

409
00:39:20,111 --> 00:39:22,488
I am your superior.
Sit down and shut up.

410
00:39:22,863 --> 00:39:25,491
When you keep information from us,
it pisses him off.

411
00:39:27,159 --> 00:39:29,704
Deputy, get me out of these cuffs
right now.

412
00:39:31,205 --> 00:39:32,456
Get out of them yourself.

413
00:39:41,632 --> 00:39:42,675
What are you doing?

414
00:39:42,967 --> 00:39:44,510
What's he doing?

415
00:39:56,814 --> 00:39:58,107
What's next, cow tipping?

416
00:39:59,608 --> 00:40:00,860
That's pretty good.

417
00:40:01,152 --> 00:40:04,196
- Very slick.
- Very slick? He broke my glasses.

418
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,032
I've never seen that.

419
00:40:07,908 --> 00:40:08,826
I have.

420
00:40:23,674 --> 00:40:27,219
Don't have a heart attack, Earl.
You've lied to the cops before.

421
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,953
What's the trouble, officer?

422
00:40:53,245 --> 00:40:55,790
Fugitive's on the loose
from the plane crash last night.

423
00:40:56,207 --> 00:40:57,917
Is that a fact? Shit!

424
00:40:58,167 --> 00:40:59,377
You seen this man?

425
00:40:59,669 --> 00:41:01,879
No, I've never seen
anybody like that.

426
00:41:02,505 --> 00:41:04,757
What about you, ma'am?
You seen this man?

427
00:41:05,257 --> 00:41:06,592
No, me neither.

428
00:41:13,432 --> 00:41:14,934
Thanks for your help, folks.

429
00:41:25,361 --> 00:41:26,862
Drive! Drive! Drive!

430
00:41:36,205 --> 00:41:37,039
Push!

431
00:41:52,138 --> 00:41:53,848
Chester, you okay?!

432
00:42:00,604 --> 00:42:01,981
You done good, Earl.

433
00:42:07,403 --> 00:42:10,197
An 18-wheeler rammed a roadblock
15 minutes ago.

434
00:42:10,489 --> 00:42:12,742
They found it outside of Paducah.
It was heading south.

435
00:42:13,409 --> 00:42:14,327
All right, load up!

436
00:42:14,618 --> 00:42:15,870
Like I said, south.

437
00:42:16,162 --> 00:42:19,248
We're going to need boats.
This guy went into the swamp.

438
00:42:20,124 --> 00:42:21,667
Shit, I hate swamps.

439
00:42:22,126 --> 00:42:26,172
Lester, it's U.S. Marshal Renfro.
We're going to need boats.

440
00:42:26,505 --> 00:42:30,176
Swamp boats. Right.
Like they use in the swamp.

441
00:42:53,324 --> 00:42:55,910
Bad news. He got a. 38 off the trucker.

442
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,371
- How many rounds?
-6 in the gun, 12 more in a box.

443
00:42:58,704 --> 00:42:59,955
Makes no difference.

444
00:43:00,206 --> 00:43:02,249
He'll be dead from snakebite by dark.

445
00:43:04,293 --> 00:43:07,505
He won't get far in that boat he stole.
It ain't got no motor.

446
00:43:07,797 --> 00:43:10,132
Boats. I hate boats, bugs and boats.

447
00:43:10,466 --> 00:43:12,885
Sam, he got a boat from here.

448
00:43:17,181 --> 00:43:18,849
Could I have your attention?

449
00:43:19,141 --> 00:43:21,227
We'll divide up and search this swamp.

450
00:43:21,519 --> 00:43:25,398
One officer with each of you.
Who knows most about this terrain?

451
00:43:27,191 --> 00:43:30,152
Who's the ugliest, most inbred,
country son of a bitch here?

452
00:43:33,656 --> 00:43:34,782
You come with me.

453
00:44:13,571 --> 00:44:14,739
How long will you be?

454
00:44:15,197 --> 00:44:17,616
Everybody com-check with me now on 3.

455
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:19,327
- Sam.
- Com-check 3.

456
00:44:22,705 --> 00:44:24,665
You get a visual, put up a flare...

457
00:44:24,957 --> 00:44:27,001
...call for backup, stay in the boat!

458
00:44:27,918 --> 00:44:30,504
How long will you be out?
I got PTA tonight.

459
00:44:30,755 --> 00:44:33,299
We'll be out till we catch him.
PTA's on hold.

460
00:44:33,924 --> 00:44:35,468
Be careful.

461
00:46:06,809 --> 00:46:07,893
I got a visual.

462
00:46:08,352 --> 00:46:10,229
Put up your flare.

463
00:46:12,148 --> 00:46:13,399
He's moving.
I'm going in.

464
00:46:13,733 --> 00:46:15,985
Stay in the boat. Wait for us.

465
00:46:33,127 --> 00:46:34,128
Through there.

466
00:46:47,558 --> 00:46:50,311
Pull up to that bank.
Get around to the other side.

467
00:46:50,561 --> 00:46:53,147
Be careful. This man's mad
and he's got a gun.

468
00:46:55,024 --> 00:46:55,941
It's him.

469
00:46:56,192 --> 00:46:57,151
Go! Faster!

470
00:47:51,455 --> 00:47:52,873
I'll take the gun.

471
00:47:55,292 --> 00:47:57,169
Come on, move! Move, move!

472
00:47:57,461 --> 00:47:58,421
What happens now?

473
00:47:58,713 --> 00:48:00,506
We dance. Walk.

474
00:48:01,132 --> 00:48:02,383
Drop the gun, pal.

475
00:48:03,884 --> 00:48:06,429
It's been a long day.
Let's end it on a positive note.

476
00:48:07,972 --> 00:48:09,724
For me or for you?

477
00:48:10,016 --> 00:48:11,559
Everyone lives,
everyone wins.

478
00:48:12,685 --> 00:48:14,895
How long will I live if you take me in?

479
00:48:16,647 --> 00:48:17,982
You forget about the plane?

480
00:48:18,274 --> 00:48:19,525
Look around, you're caught.

481
00:48:24,822 --> 00:48:26,115
It's over.

482
00:48:27,408 --> 00:48:28,701
Let's go home.

483
00:48:36,125 --> 00:48:37,752
You go home.

484
00:49:01,901 --> 00:49:03,110
Gerard's been hit.

485
00:49:10,326 --> 00:49:11,410
He's over there.

486
00:50:03,295 --> 00:50:04,964
- How is he?
- He'll be fine.

487
00:50:20,438 --> 00:50:21,981
How is it to nearly get killed?

488
00:50:23,607 --> 00:50:27,194
If he was trying to kill me, he'd have
shot me in the head, not the vest.

489
00:50:29,155 --> 00:50:31,198
Ever occur to you maybe he just missed?

490
00:50:31,449 --> 00:50:33,576
We're not dealing with a guy
who misses.

491
00:50:37,288 --> 00:50:40,333
Maybe it's time to let someone else
catch this one.

492
00:50:41,834 --> 00:50:44,337
- You don't think I'm incapable-
- You're capable, sure.

493
00:50:44,628 --> 00:50:46,547
Okay, then let me do my job.

494
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:52,428
Don't make me wrong, Sam.

495
00:50:53,804 --> 00:50:55,264
You screw up and I swear-

496
00:50:55,806 --> 00:50:56,891
I know.

497
00:51:00,811 --> 00:51:02,229
I love you, Sam.

498
00:51:05,816 --> 00:51:07,652
But don't think I won't fire your ass.

499
00:51:23,834 --> 00:51:28,089
Biggs, you and Cooper are staying here.
We're going back to Chicago.

500
00:51:28,464 --> 00:51:31,884
We'll find out who put that gun
on the plane and who Mark Roberts is.

501
00:51:32,134 --> 00:51:35,096
Take us to the airport. Who's got
my gun and credentials?

502
00:51:43,187 --> 00:51:46,023
Look, I made a mistake, okay?
I usually work alone.

503
00:51:46,357 --> 00:51:48,234
We're lucky I got shot, kid.

504
00:51:48,567 --> 00:51:49,694
Lucky?

505
00:51:49,986 --> 00:51:52,655
If he'd shot one of my deputies,
you wouldn't see your mama again...

506
00:51:52,947 --> 00:51:55,241
...I'd be in jail for shooting you.

507
00:51:57,159 --> 00:51:58,244
We're lucky.

508
00:51:58,536 --> 00:52:00,413
I thought we don't
take our work personally.

509
00:52:00,705 --> 00:52:01,747
We don't.

510
00:52:03,708 --> 00:52:04,792
I do.

511
00:52:14,343 --> 00:52:15,302
Just a sec.

512
00:52:16,012 --> 00:52:17,221
Starbucks.

513
00:52:20,057 --> 00:52:22,143
Some guy has a question
about his grinder.

514
00:52:22,643 --> 00:52:23,769
Excuse me.

515
00:52:28,691 --> 00:52:29,692
Can you talk?

516
00:52:30,192 --> 00:52:31,569
Wait a minute.

517
00:52:33,529 --> 00:52:36,073
Were you hurt? I saw the crash on TV.

518
00:52:37,199 --> 00:52:40,703
- Baby, I'm fine.
- They keep saying you're a criminal.

519
00:52:40,995 --> 00:52:42,121
You murdered 2 people.

520
00:52:42,455 --> 00:52:45,791
No, no, it's a lie.
Marie, listen to me.

521
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:50,546
Where are you?

522
00:52:50,838 --> 00:52:52,256
I can't tell you that now.

523
00:52:52,548 --> 00:52:55,468
I know there's some things
I didn't tell you about myself.

524
00:52:55,718 --> 00:52:58,179
Believe me. I didn't do
what they say I did.

525
00:52:59,430 --> 00:53:00,723
You do believe me?

526
00:53:01,015 --> 00:53:02,683
I want to believe you, Mark.

527
00:53:03,392 --> 00:53:05,394
I'm just confused and scared.

528
00:53:05,728 --> 00:53:07,396
Now, Marie, listen to me.

529
00:53:07,730 --> 00:53:09,774
Before we met,
I worked for the government.

530
00:53:10,066 --> 00:53:13,027
I was on a routine assignment
when it was ambushed.

531
00:53:13,736 --> 00:53:16,822
I killed 2 men in self-defense.

532
00:53:17,865 --> 00:53:19,950
Marie, I did not murder anyone.

533
00:53:20,534 --> 00:53:21,410
Believe me.

534
00:53:21,702 --> 00:53:22,828
I wouldn't lie to you.

535
00:53:23,079 --> 00:53:24,372
What are you going to do?

536
00:53:24,622 --> 00:53:27,667
I'll find the person who set me up
and clear my name.

537
00:53:28,209 --> 00:53:32,046
It's something I thought
I could hide from, but I guess I can't.

538
00:53:33,381 --> 00:53:34,590
Will I see you again?

539
00:53:34,882 --> 00:53:37,468
Oh, come on now. Don't be crazy.

540
00:53:37,968 --> 00:53:39,345
Of course you will.

541
00:53:43,933 --> 00:53:47,812
I hate involving you in this, but,
baby, I got nobody else I can trust.

542
00:53:48,646 --> 00:53:49,939
I can trust you?

543
00:53:50,231 --> 00:53:51,816
Of course you can.

544
00:53:52,108 --> 00:53:53,359
I love you.

545
00:53:54,068 --> 00:53:55,361
I need your help.

546
00:54:05,454 --> 00:54:06,330
Henry?

547
00:54:07,748 --> 00:54:09,333
Got the casebooks on Roberts?

548
00:54:09,583 --> 00:54:13,713
There was a woman at the hospital
when he was arrested. Paid his bill.

549
00:54:13,963 --> 00:54:15,548
- In cash.
- Find her.

550
00:54:19,051 --> 00:54:20,302
U.N. garage has cameras.

551
00:54:21,429 --> 00:54:23,472
Get the date and time of the murders,
find the tapes.

552
00:54:23,806 --> 00:54:25,391
We'll never get clearance for that.

553
00:54:26,017 --> 00:54:28,936
Get the clearance, get the tapes.
Don't tell me what we can't do.

554
00:54:30,813 --> 00:54:31,856
I'll get it done.

555
00:54:32,189 --> 00:54:33,816
- What?
- Roberts' apartment was clean.

556
00:54:34,108 --> 00:54:36,902
Been there 6 months,
neighbors barely remember him.

557
00:54:37,153 --> 00:54:38,654
Where'd he work?

558
00:54:39,113 --> 00:54:40,906
- I'm going there next.
- How about now?

559
00:54:42,992 --> 00:54:44,535
What about the zip gun?

560
00:54:44,827 --> 00:54:49,081
We covered workers at the Bureau of
Prisons who could've planted it...

561
00:54:49,332 --> 00:54:51,459
...except for one guy, Kevin Peters.

562
00:54:51,792 --> 00:54:54,837
- Out on sick leave.
- Find him. Check them all out again.

563
00:54:55,171 --> 00:54:58,341
I want to go through their families,
their associates...

564
00:54:58,632 --> 00:55:00,009
...changes in personal habits...

565
00:55:00,301 --> 00:55:01,761
...bank records, medical,
the works.

566
00:55:02,053 --> 00:55:04,847
- Stand on them till one squeaks.
- I'm on it.

567
00:55:29,538 --> 00:55:30,623
To see you walk in...

568
00:55:30,915 --> 00:55:34,960
...was like a mainline of ego boost.
I must've done something right...

569
00:55:35,336 --> 00:55:37,630
...to see you come all the way here
in one piece.

570
00:55:37,922 --> 00:55:39,840
It was all you, Sarge.

571
00:55:40,091 --> 00:55:43,636
Little birds talking
about big dollars to bring you in.

572
00:55:44,345 --> 00:55:45,304
Dead or alive?

573
00:55:45,596 --> 00:55:47,306
Emphasis on dead.

574
00:55:47,848 --> 00:55:49,308
On the plane, they tried.

575
00:55:49,850 --> 00:55:51,602
Almost succeeded too.

576
00:55:54,605 --> 00:55:55,606
You tempted?

577
00:55:56,065 --> 00:55:57,984
If you're the traitor they say you are.

578
00:55:58,275 --> 00:56:00,277
That's bullshit.

579
00:56:01,237 --> 00:56:03,781
- I got set up from the word „go. „
- By who?

580
00:56:04,073 --> 00:56:05,866
That's what I got to figure out.

581
00:56:06,575 --> 00:56:08,452
It's somebody on the inside.

582
00:56:09,578 --> 00:56:12,832
Got instructions by the usual channels.
Supposed to make a drop-off.

583
00:56:13,082 --> 00:56:14,500
Then all hell breaks loose.

584
00:56:16,419 --> 00:56:18,045
I thought I could disappear.

585
00:56:19,714 --> 00:56:21,173
Boy, was I wrong.

586
00:56:21,590 --> 00:56:22,466
Your next move?

587
00:56:25,511 --> 00:56:29,598
Find the Chinese bagman from the
U.N. garage and hope he leads me...

588
00:56:29,932 --> 00:56:31,142
...to whoever set me up.

589
00:56:32,143 --> 00:56:33,102
Get righteous again.

590
00:56:33,602 --> 00:56:34,687
How will you do that?

591
00:56:34,979 --> 00:56:36,856
I got ideas. Got the stuff?

592
00:56:44,822 --> 00:56:46,282
It's clean.

593
00:56:52,872 --> 00:56:53,914
The key?

594
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:07,386
Take it all.

595
00:57:07,762 --> 00:57:09,597
I don't want you back here again.

596
00:57:10,097 --> 00:57:11,182
You don't believe me?

597
00:57:11,474 --> 00:57:13,517
I've gone as far as I'm prepared to go.

598
00:57:13,976 --> 00:57:16,062
I'll catch the rest on CNN.

599
00:57:19,023 --> 00:57:20,524
Good luck to you, man.

600
00:57:37,792 --> 00:57:39,377
You're a lucky guy.

601
00:57:40,378 --> 00:57:42,296
The old lady just kicked...

602
00:57:42,630 --> 00:57:44,298
...day before yesterday.

603
00:57:48,969 --> 00:57:50,471
I'll move out what you don't want.

604
00:58:01,524 --> 00:58:02,817
It's perfect.

605
00:58:25,089 --> 00:58:27,633
- What do you got?
- We're in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

606
00:58:27,883 --> 00:58:29,635
We got this guy says our fugitive...

607
00:58:29,969 --> 00:58:31,721
...jumped him near Eddyville, Kentucky.

608
00:58:32,054 --> 00:58:34,306
Tied him up and stuffed him
in his own camper.

609
00:58:34,682 --> 00:58:35,558
How long?

610
00:58:35,850 --> 00:58:36,976
Let me find out.

611
00:58:37,226 --> 00:58:39,061
- How long was he in there?
-6 hours.

612
00:58:39,395 --> 00:58:40,730
6 hours.

613
00:58:41,022 --> 00:58:44,650
What do you want? We're exhausted.
We haven't slept for 2 days.

614
00:58:44,942 --> 00:58:46,902
Stay on the trail.
Sleep next month.

615
00:58:48,612 --> 00:58:51,073
Biggs and Cooper found a guy
tied up in his truck...

616
00:58:51,324 --> 00:58:52,908
...who I.D.'d our man.

617
00:58:54,744 --> 00:58:58,414
Harrisburg. Seems he is heading north.
Maybe now you'll start listening to me.

618
00:58:58,873 --> 00:59:03,711
Explain why a ruthless assassin keeps
going out of his way to let people live.

619
00:59:06,922 --> 00:59:07,923
We're right on it.

620
00:59:08,215 --> 00:59:09,091
What's up?

621
00:59:09,383 --> 00:59:10,343
Found his lady.

622
00:59:14,388 --> 00:59:15,723
Where the hell is-?

623
00:59:24,732 --> 00:59:25,858
Marie Bineaux?

624
00:59:26,233 --> 00:59:27,902
- Yes?
- U.S. Marshals.

625
00:59:29,278 --> 00:59:30,237
What's this about?

626
00:59:30,613 --> 00:59:32,698
Just a few questions.
May we come in?

627
00:59:36,118 --> 00:59:37,078
Just a second.

628
00:59:41,499 --> 00:59:42,500
Thank you.

629
00:59:49,799 --> 00:59:51,092
What do you want?

630
00:59:51,425 --> 00:59:53,010
You recognize this man?

631
00:59:55,137 --> 00:59:56,847
Never seen him before.

632
00:59:58,516 --> 00:59:59,433
- Excuse me.
- Really?

633
00:59:59,809 --> 01:00:00,851
No.

634
01:00:01,894 --> 01:00:03,229
You sure about that?

635
01:00:04,438 --> 01:00:06,565
Yes. Sorry.

636
01:00:07,274 --> 01:00:10,277
This is a receipt from Chicago Memorial
for a Mark Warren.

637
01:00:11,195 --> 01:00:13,447
Paid in full. Is that your signature?

638
01:00:13,990 --> 01:00:15,908
We can verify your signature.

639
01:00:17,785 --> 01:00:18,911
Are you here legally?

640
01:00:19,161 --> 01:00:21,080
Familiar with
harboring and abetting laws?

641
01:00:21,706 --> 01:00:23,708
That's five to ten years.

642
01:00:23,958 --> 01:00:25,543
Then they kick you out.

643
01:00:25,835 --> 01:00:29,088
Why are you threatening me?
Even if I knew this man...

644
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:31,424
...that's no crime.
I've done nothing wrong.

645
01:00:31,674 --> 01:00:33,259
Mark Roberts has.

646
01:00:34,802 --> 01:00:35,970
DSS Special Agent...

647
01:00:36,345 --> 01:00:37,555
...Sam Harmon.

648
01:00:37,972 --> 01:00:40,725
Your friend killed him
with his bare hands.

649
01:00:41,142 --> 01:00:42,601
Sam was a friend of mine.

650
01:00:43,561 --> 01:00:45,229
So was Neil Kasinski.

651
01:00:46,272 --> 01:00:48,607
- Neil had 3 kids.
- Stop doing this to me!

652
01:00:49,066 --> 01:00:50,276
I don't know anything.

653
01:00:50,860 --> 01:00:54,280
I haven't heard from him and I won't.
I haven't seen him.

654
01:00:55,531 --> 01:00:56,949
So you do know him.

655
01:00:57,241 --> 01:00:58,743
- You lied to us.
- A federal offense.

656
01:01:03,539 --> 01:01:07,293
Put those things away. That's enough.
I'm sorry if we upset you.

657
01:01:07,877 --> 01:01:09,920
If you have the need,
you can call me...

658
01:01:10,713 --> 01:01:11,672
...at this number.

659
01:01:14,258 --> 01:01:15,676
Did you do that painting?

660
01:01:16,635 --> 01:01:18,095
Beautiful.

661
01:01:18,346 --> 01:01:20,473
You have talent.
I love the little airplane.

662
01:01:21,932 --> 01:01:23,309
Who took this photograph?

663
01:01:23,559 --> 01:01:25,478
- A friend of mine.
- He's good.

664
01:01:25,895 --> 01:01:26,854
Who said it's a he?

665
01:01:27,188 --> 01:01:29,440
Nobody. I just figured.
I mean, you look so...

666
01:01:29,857 --> 01:01:30,941
...happy.

667
01:01:33,194 --> 01:01:34,528
If that's all...

668
01:01:35,446 --> 01:01:36,530
...I need to get to work.

669
01:01:37,239 --> 01:01:38,491
Let's go, guys.

670
01:01:40,409 --> 01:01:41,494
You're wrong about him.

671
01:01:42,078 --> 01:01:43,162
How's that?

672
01:01:43,537 --> 01:01:46,165
This is not a man who could've done
the things you said.

673
01:01:47,249 --> 01:01:51,003
This is a killer who committed murder
and probably will again.

674
01:01:51,295 --> 01:01:53,673
He'll do anything
and use anybody to escape.

675
01:01:53,923 --> 01:01:55,633
I'm glad you won't see him anymore.

676
01:02:05,309 --> 01:02:06,727
That was good work.

677
01:02:06,978 --> 01:02:07,853
Yes, it was.

678
01:02:08,104 --> 01:02:10,523
Newman, set up a surveillance
on Ms. Bineaux.

679
01:02:10,815 --> 01:02:14,026
- Get a tap order for here and at work.
- He won't make that mistake.

680
01:02:14,318 --> 01:02:16,404
He'll contact her.
I'll bet my Bears tickets.

681
01:02:21,242 --> 01:02:22,493
Kevin Peters...

682
01:02:22,743 --> 01:02:26,205
...the guy who was out sick,
must be the one who planted the gun.

683
01:02:26,539 --> 01:02:29,959
2 days before the plane crash,
his sister gets 20K in her account.

684
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:31,752
Where is he?

685
01:02:32,044 --> 01:02:35,715
At the gym. Must have been one of those
24-minute viruses.

686
01:02:36,257 --> 01:02:38,009
Royce, go with Newman.

687
01:02:38,467 --> 01:02:40,428
Get me those U.N. surveillance tapes.

688
01:02:56,485 --> 01:03:00,406
I haven't worked out in months.
I got to get my fat ass back to a gym.

689
01:03:00,656 --> 01:03:02,241
Yeah, you're getting old.

690
01:03:02,616 --> 01:03:03,701
And weak.

691
01:03:07,830 --> 01:03:09,540
Gym of the Living Dead, huh?

692
01:03:12,168 --> 01:03:13,210
Hi, how you doing?

693
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:15,504
U.S. Marshals.

694
01:03:17,298 --> 01:03:18,716
See this guy around?

695
01:03:22,470 --> 01:03:24,972
I think he's the last one here.
Check the showers.

696
01:03:25,222 --> 01:03:28,017
Thanks. I'll go check out over there.

697
01:03:44,575 --> 01:03:46,118
Kevin Peters?

698
01:04:01,008 --> 01:04:02,635
I got a dead guy here! Come on!

699
01:04:11,644 --> 01:04:16,273
Damn! The dude we just lost is the guy
who set up the zip gun hit on the plane.

700
01:04:16,565 --> 01:04:20,403
I don't get this. What's the connection
between the Chinese and our fugitive?

701
01:04:21,278 --> 01:04:24,949
Get me the U.S. Marshal's office.
We got a homicide.

702
01:04:32,790 --> 01:04:34,041
Where's the coffee?

703
01:04:34,291 --> 01:04:36,335
Someone's calling
on her boss' cell phone.

704
01:04:36,627 --> 01:04:38,546
Carla, get us a lock on that call.

705
01:04:45,928 --> 01:04:48,097
Mark, it was horrible.
The police found me.

706
01:04:48,514 --> 01:04:50,808
I knew they would.
But are you all right?

707
01:04:52,761 --> 01:04:54,179
Just follow the plan.

708
01:04:54,512 --> 01:04:56,306
This will all be over soon.

709
01:04:56,806 --> 01:04:58,016
It will be all right.

710
01:04:58,266 --> 01:04:59,434
We'll be together.

711
01:04:59,768 --> 01:05:00,769
Video print on that.

712
01:05:01,686 --> 01:05:03,313
You have the key to the locker?

713
01:05:03,647 --> 01:05:07,859
Good. The documents are in a briefcase.
Can you bring them to me tomorrow?

714
01:05:08,151 --> 01:05:09,027
Yes, of course.

715
01:05:09,319 --> 01:05:10,320
That's my girl.

716
01:05:10,820 --> 01:05:11,780
I love you.

717
01:05:12,072 --> 01:05:13,198
I know.

718
01:05:13,657 --> 01:05:14,783
I love you too.

719
01:05:15,825 --> 01:05:17,244
I got to go.

720
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:29,464
What have we got?

721
01:05:30,257 --> 01:05:31,508
Tapes from the U.N. hit.

722
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:35,428
5 cameras.
I've digitized and synchronized them.

723
01:05:36,805 --> 01:05:41,351
Henry intercepted a long-distance call
from Roberts to his girlfriend.

724
01:05:41,601 --> 01:05:43,645
We're getting the location
on the cell site.

725
01:05:43,937 --> 01:05:44,813
Excellent.

726
01:05:46,356 --> 01:05:47,899
Roll them.

727
01:05:48,149 --> 01:05:49,276
Here we go.

728
01:05:51,278 --> 01:05:52,320
Who's that?

729
01:05:54,114 --> 01:05:54,990
Kasinski.

730
01:05:55,282 --> 01:05:55,991
Kasinski?

731
01:05:56,241 --> 01:05:58,159
My fellow agent. He was killed.

732
01:05:58,410 --> 01:05:59,578
And a mystery guest.

733
01:06:00,662 --> 01:06:02,539
I assume it's Mr. Roberts.

734
01:06:13,425 --> 01:06:14,467
Stop.

735
01:06:15,844 --> 01:06:19,055
On the big screen.
Move in close.

736
01:06:27,022 --> 01:06:28,064
Bingo.

737
01:06:28,481 --> 01:06:30,817
That's the Chinaman from the gym.

738
01:06:31,067 --> 01:06:32,861
Mr. Slice-and-Dice.
Print it.

739
01:06:38,950 --> 01:06:42,579
Mr. Slice-and-Dice and our mystery man
have a bag exchange here.

740
01:06:42,996 --> 01:06:46,875
What do you think is in the bag?
I'll bet it's not his dirty laundry.

741
01:06:49,794 --> 01:06:51,379
Your friends are intercepting this.

742
01:06:51,630 --> 01:06:53,089
- What do you know?
- Nothing.

743
01:06:55,050 --> 01:06:57,677
Carla, screen 6.
Who's that?

744
01:06:58,178 --> 01:07:00,597
To the big screen.
Blow it up.

745
01:07:05,810 --> 01:07:07,229
Back it up.

746
01:07:08,605 --> 01:07:10,482
Go forward.

747
01:07:11,650 --> 01:07:13,276
That's Agent Harmon.

748
01:07:27,666 --> 01:07:31,711
Lamb said they were killed
in cold blood. Looks like self-defense.

749
01:07:32,295 --> 01:07:33,296
What's going on?

750
01:07:33,588 --> 01:07:36,258
It doesn't look like
the story Lamb told us.

751
01:07:54,150 --> 01:07:55,110
Big screen.

752
01:07:55,819 --> 01:07:56,820
The briefcase.

753
01:08:01,366 --> 01:08:04,578
Cosmo, how did they say
they connected our man to this crime?

754
01:08:04,869 --> 01:08:06,663
A fingerprint match.

755
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:07,831
Move in.

756
01:08:08,582 --> 01:08:09,791
Fingerprint match.

757
01:08:12,085 --> 01:08:15,964
Did they find his gloves in a garbage
can and turn them inside out?

758
01:08:21,177 --> 01:08:22,262
Print it up.

759
01:08:27,309 --> 01:08:28,518
We got to go to New York.

760
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:39,154
What the hell are these?
And what's in New York?

761
01:08:40,530 --> 01:08:41,615
A rat.

762
01:10:48,074 --> 01:10:50,952
Now listen, Sam,
I'll do the talking, okay?

763
01:10:54,039 --> 01:10:54,956
Don't get up.

764
01:10:55,332 --> 01:10:57,292
You make a better target
sitting down.

765
01:10:58,543 --> 01:11:00,712
Is this visit to deliver our fugitive?

766
01:11:01,087 --> 01:11:03,298
Not with the horseshit
you've been handing us.

767
01:11:03,632 --> 01:11:04,674
Excuse me?

768
01:11:05,008 --> 01:11:08,303
John Doe's fingerprints
you had planted at the scene.

769
01:11:10,513 --> 01:11:11,890
Want the illustrated version?

770
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:17,979
Would you excuse us,
gentlemen, please?

771
01:11:24,819 --> 01:11:26,196
Where'd you get the photos?

772
01:11:26,488 --> 01:11:27,739
Off U.N. surveillance tapes.

773
01:11:27,989 --> 01:11:30,367
That is highly-classified material.

774
01:11:31,493 --> 01:11:33,662
- Know anything about this?
- I'll look into it.

775
01:11:34,079 --> 01:11:37,582
Tell you what I'd look into
is how you got those fingerprints.

776
01:11:37,832 --> 01:11:40,835
You had them on file
because the guy works for you.

777
01:11:42,045 --> 01:11:43,630
Is that right or wrong?

778
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:46,049
We want information,
or I'll go to Washington.

779
01:11:50,470 --> 01:11:52,430
The man you know as Mark Roberts...

780
01:11:52,889 --> 01:11:54,724
...is in fact Mark Sheridan...

781
01:11:55,308 --> 01:11:59,521
...ex-U.S. Marine special forces,
ex-CIA black ops, recruited by us...

782
01:11:59,813 --> 01:12:02,190
...and until last year,
one of our kites in New York.

783
01:12:03,066 --> 01:12:05,986
Someone who does our dirty work
without official connection.

784
01:12:06,319 --> 01:12:08,905
If something goes wrong,
the string's cut, he's on his own.

785
01:12:09,197 --> 01:12:11,825
Somewhere along the line,
Sheridan went bad.

786
01:12:13,076 --> 01:12:14,995
We got this from the same tapes.

787
01:12:15,787 --> 01:12:16,705
Who is he?

788
01:12:18,999 --> 01:12:23,086
Xian Chen, People's Republic of China,
cultural attache“ to the U.N.

789
01:12:23,420 --> 01:12:25,380
In fact, a member of Chinese intel.

790
01:12:25,755 --> 01:12:28,967
For the past two years
we've known there was a mole...

791
01:12:29,301 --> 01:12:31,219
...in the State Department,
selling secrets to China.

792
01:12:31,511 --> 01:12:34,389
We suspected Chen
delivered the money.

793
01:12:34,973 --> 01:12:36,391
Chen led us to Sheridan.

794
01:12:36,933 --> 01:12:39,686
Agents Kasinski and Harmon
were supposed to...

795
01:12:39,978 --> 01:12:43,690
...intercept an exchange between
Chen and Sheridan at the U.N. garage.

796
01:12:43,982 --> 01:12:46,484
It went south.
Sheridan was better than we were.

797
01:12:46,860 --> 01:12:48,403
Better than us all.

798
01:12:51,156 --> 01:12:52,699
Why did you keep this from us?

799
01:12:54,826 --> 01:12:56,828
Very simple. Need to know.

800
01:12:57,162 --> 01:13:01,750
We believed you'd quickly apprehend him
and we'd sort the issue out internally.

801
01:13:02,292 --> 01:13:06,046
Seems our confidence in
Deputy Gerard was misplaced.

802
01:13:06,504 --> 01:13:07,839
He allowed Sheridan to escape...

803
01:13:08,173 --> 01:13:10,592
...and managed to get shot
in the process.

804
01:13:12,177 --> 01:13:15,305
I admit it was wrong
to withhold information from you...

805
01:13:15,597 --> 01:13:18,183
...but the fact remains,
Sheridan killed those agents.

806
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:21,561
He's still at large.
He's armed, he's dangerous.

807
01:13:22,103 --> 01:13:24,773
Until we have him, we won't know
the extent of the leak.

808
01:13:27,901 --> 01:13:31,863
Now you have your precious information.
What do you intend to do?

809
01:13:33,907 --> 01:13:34,950
Catch him.

810
01:13:47,712 --> 01:13:48,797
Got you, son of a bitch.

811
01:13:56,346 --> 01:13:58,640
I want surveillance
on the Chinese consulate.

812
01:13:59,057 --> 01:14:01,685
I checked the New York office.
They're setting it up now.

813
01:14:02,185 --> 01:14:03,562
Not bad for government work.

814
01:14:03,853 --> 01:14:05,897
No. Black canvas bag.

815
01:14:06,273 --> 01:14:10,277
I'm wearing the clothes off my back.
I have no clothing.

816
01:14:11,236 --> 01:14:13,154
-3 hours late.
- We came into La Guardia.

817
01:14:13,572 --> 01:14:16,032
Hi, Sam. Nice to see you too.

818
01:14:19,077 --> 01:14:20,537
- Whose food?
- Go ahead.

819
01:14:20,954 --> 01:14:22,914
See what you can do, please.

820
01:14:23,582 --> 01:14:26,960
Cosmo, you look so sad.
Miss me?

821
01:14:27,294 --> 01:14:30,338
No, I miss my new Armani jacket,
my shirts, ties...

822
01:14:31,131 --> 01:14:31,923
...everything.

823
01:14:32,299 --> 01:14:34,593
You know, I hate this place already.

824
01:14:59,951 --> 01:15:01,786
Sam, we're at O'Hare.

825
01:15:02,621 --> 01:15:05,582
Marie just retrieved a briefcase
from a long-term locker.

826
01:15:05,957 --> 01:15:07,375
- Bought a ticket to-
- New York.

827
01:15:07,667 --> 01:15:10,921
- What about the cell-phone trace?
- Just got it. It's in Manhattan.

828
01:15:11,630 --> 01:15:13,590
Third Avenue and 42nd Street.

829
01:15:14,007 --> 01:15:16,426
Get on the plane with her.
Our guys'll meet you.

830
01:15:16,801 --> 01:15:18,929
Third Avenue and 42nd.
We're going to work.

831
01:15:19,346 --> 01:15:23,016
Get your stuff. We're neighbors with
Mark Sheridan. Let's go, look alive!

832
01:15:23,391 --> 01:15:25,310
Our fugitive is in a 4-block area...

833
01:15:25,644 --> 01:15:28,438
...between 42nd and 46th Street,
1 st and 3rd Avenue.

834
01:15:28,772 --> 01:15:30,565
Do a full-target search.

835
01:16:05,183 --> 01:16:06,768
- What can I do for you?
- Seen this guy?

836
01:16:08,353 --> 01:16:10,814
- No, sorry.
- He might have changed his appearance.

837
01:16:14,401 --> 01:16:15,819
Wait a minute, let me see that.

838
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:20,699
I've seen a guy who looks like that.
Rented an apartment here a few days ago.

839
01:16:20,991 --> 01:16:21,825
This guy?

840
01:16:23,034 --> 01:16:24,411
Didn't I just say that?

841
01:16:24,869 --> 01:16:25,829
Give me a line.

842
01:16:26,079 --> 01:16:27,414
What's going on?

843
01:16:30,041 --> 01:16:31,084
I got him.

844
01:16:37,674 --> 01:16:39,384
Police! Nobody move!

845
01:16:46,016 --> 01:16:47,767
- He's gone.
- Nobody home.

846
01:16:48,101 --> 01:16:49,811
The dressing room's back there.

847
01:17:00,989 --> 01:17:02,032
He likes toys.

848
01:17:07,621 --> 01:17:09,456
- Good picture quality.
- Turn it off.

849
01:17:16,963 --> 01:17:18,506
Isn't that the Chinese consulate?

850
01:17:40,946 --> 01:17:42,239
Okay, baby.

851
01:17:42,656 --> 01:17:45,742
We don't have much time.
They're outside. Did you bring it?

852
01:17:48,536 --> 01:17:49,329
Where is she?

853
01:17:49,621 --> 01:17:51,164
Saks. She's trying on a dress.

854
01:17:51,873 --> 01:17:55,001
She's not trying on a dress.
He's with her. Get in there now!

855
01:18:08,932 --> 01:18:11,059
Excuse me.
Just looking for a shoplifter.

856
01:18:15,814 --> 01:18:19,442
We checked. No sign of Sheridan.
Girl's on her own.

857
01:18:19,776 --> 01:18:23,446
Stay with her. Whatever you do,
do not lose her.

858
01:18:30,662 --> 01:18:33,123
We're all looking for the same guy.

859
01:18:33,373 --> 01:18:35,750
I got Chen.
He's leaving the consulate.

860
01:18:36,042 --> 01:18:36,918
There!

861
01:18:39,629 --> 01:18:41,214
Watch this apartment.

862
01:18:44,301 --> 01:18:46,511
If we got Chen,
Sheridan won't be far behind him.

863
01:18:46,970 --> 01:18:48,388
Let's hit the road.

864
01:18:48,889 --> 01:18:50,140
Cooper, Biggs'll pick you up.

865
01:18:50,473 --> 01:18:53,435
Newman, we found Chen.
He just left the Chinese consulate.

866
01:18:57,689 --> 01:18:59,357
I see him. In pursuit.

867
01:19:13,705 --> 01:19:17,000
He's getting in a cab.
Where are you guys?

868
01:19:18,043 --> 01:19:19,502
Heading west on 51 st Street.

869
01:19:19,878 --> 01:19:21,171
We'll lose him.
Where are you?

870
01:19:23,548 --> 01:19:25,467
Tired of waiting on you!

871
01:19:39,940 --> 01:19:41,942
That cab on the left.
He's stopping.

872
01:19:42,275 --> 01:19:43,360
I got him.

873
01:19:44,277 --> 01:19:46,238
Sheridan could be anywhere.
Stay alive.

874
01:19:54,371 --> 01:19:57,374
Cosmo, Royce, take the left.
Newman, with me.

875
01:20:12,764 --> 01:20:14,307
- Stay on Chen.
- Right behind him.

876
01:20:51,261 --> 01:20:53,221
Guy in the green watch cap...

877
01:20:53,471 --> 01:20:55,932
...with a briefcase, looking at Chen.

878
01:20:57,017 --> 01:20:58,935
What the hell is a watch cap?
Is it Sheridan?

879
01:20:59,269 --> 01:21:00,520
No, but grab him.

880
01:21:00,979 --> 01:21:02,063
We got him.

881
01:21:20,999 --> 01:21:22,167
Hold it, back off!

882
01:21:22,667 --> 01:21:25,503
Watch cap just changed bags
with Chen. You follow Chen.

883
01:21:25,837 --> 01:21:27,422
I'll follow that bag.

884
01:21:28,215 --> 01:21:29,466
That bag's got to be the bait.

885
01:21:34,554 --> 01:21:35,722
Taxi!

886
01:21:53,740 --> 01:21:54,616
Out of the car!

887
01:22:06,044 --> 01:22:09,005
We're headed north on 3rd
in a silver Cadillac.

888
01:22:09,339 --> 01:22:10,215
We'll find you.

889
01:22:11,550 --> 01:22:12,968
Got him up there on the left?

890
01:22:23,728 --> 01:22:26,273
You with me?
I'm on the 59th Street Bridge.

891
01:22:26,648 --> 01:22:29,109
We're with you.
Just coming onto the bridge now.

892
01:22:34,281 --> 01:22:35,490
You still got Chen?

893
01:22:35,865 --> 01:22:39,452
We're following him.
He's pulling into the Chinese consulate.

894
01:22:55,552 --> 01:22:57,095
You mind not lighting that?

895
01:22:57,470 --> 01:22:58,263
Yes.

896
01:23:09,107 --> 01:23:11,443
What the hell's he doing
at the graveyard?

897
01:23:14,779 --> 01:23:17,657
Biggs, park here and cover this gate.

898
01:23:17,949 --> 01:23:19,159
Got that, Sam.

899
01:23:39,638 --> 01:23:41,806
Looks like he's heading for that chapel.

900
01:24:12,128 --> 01:24:15,382
- Well, he's not going in there to pray.
- No, sir.

901
01:25:24,367 --> 01:25:27,621
A cab's leaving the cemetery.
Have NYPD pick it up.

902
01:25:28,872 --> 01:25:30,040
What's going on?

903
01:25:30,415 --> 01:25:33,293
I don't know.
I bet Sheridan does, though.

904
01:25:33,793 --> 01:25:36,213
Sam. We're at the consulate.

905
01:25:36,713 --> 01:25:39,633
No sign of Chen since he went inside.
What should we do?

906
01:25:39,966 --> 01:25:44,763
Put the NYPD on him. I want you and
Royce here now at Queens Hill Cemetery.

907
01:25:45,138 --> 01:25:46,890
Where's Queens Hill Cemetery?

908
01:25:47,265 --> 01:25:48,058
Ask a cop.

909
01:25:48,975 --> 01:25:50,894
- You know?
- I'll get us there. Put it out.

910
01:25:51,770 --> 01:25:53,271
Throw it out. Thank you.

911
01:25:54,105 --> 01:25:55,315
What do we do now?

912
01:25:55,899 --> 01:25:57,150
We wait.

913
01:26:12,457 --> 01:26:13,500
You know...

914
01:26:14,793 --> 01:26:16,419
...our day could be worse, right?

915
01:26:21,091 --> 01:26:22,634
Is that...?

916
01:26:23,343 --> 01:26:24,469
Right there.

917
01:26:25,971 --> 01:26:28,014
It's Barrows. What's he doing here?

918
01:26:29,849 --> 01:26:32,644
You won't believe who just arrived
in a funeral procession.

919
01:26:32,894 --> 01:26:37,816
Agent Barrows. He's in a silver Lumina
about 7 or 8 cars back.

920
01:26:48,034 --> 01:26:48,743
Got him?

921
01:26:51,329 --> 01:26:52,956
Think he's here for a funeral?

922
01:27:03,383 --> 01:27:05,218
Cover the side of the chapel.

923
01:27:05,635 --> 01:27:06,887
Got you, Sam.

924
01:27:14,019 --> 01:27:15,103
Cosmo, where you at?

925
01:27:15,353 --> 01:27:18,899
I'm in traffic in New York City,
where do you think? We're on our way!

926
01:27:26,531 --> 01:27:29,784
Go inside, be sure
there's no way out the back.

927
01:27:33,872 --> 01:27:35,665
The Lord is my rock...

928
01:27:36,750 --> 01:27:38,460
...and my fortress...

929
01:27:38,877 --> 01:27:40,420
...and my deliverer...

930
01:27:40,879 --> 01:27:42,380
...my God, my strength...

931
01:27:42,756 --> 01:27:44,049
...in whom I will trust.

932
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:48,887
My buckler and the horn
of my salvation...

933
01:27:49,221 --> 01:27:51,139
...and my high tower. „

934
01:28:15,914 --> 01:28:19,000
All right, people, pay attention.
We got Sheridan.

935
01:28:19,709 --> 01:28:21,753
Front of the chapel.
Let him go inside.

936
01:28:28,468 --> 01:28:30,178
Will you move?!
See the lights?

937
01:28:54,828 --> 01:28:56,204
Son of a bitch,
why'd you do it?!

938
01:28:56,663 --> 01:28:57,914
What are you talking about?

939
01:28:58,248 --> 01:28:59,457
You don't know?

940
01:28:59,833 --> 01:29:01,459
You're selling secrets to China.

941
01:29:02,168 --> 01:29:04,170
An American response
to an invasion of Taiwan.

942
01:29:04,462 --> 01:29:06,715
Strategic defense of South Korea.
Make sense now?

943
01:29:07,132 --> 01:29:09,801
Why should it? I don't know
what you're talking about.

944
01:29:10,176 --> 01:29:12,304
- Don't lie to me!
- Don't kill me, don't kill me!

945
01:29:12,596 --> 01:29:15,181
- I'll do what you want.
- Don't worry, I won't kill you.

946
01:29:15,557 --> 01:29:17,767
You'll make me righteous.
Why'd you set me up?

947
01:29:19,603 --> 01:29:20,812
Why'd you set me up?!

948
01:29:21,104 --> 01:29:24,649
Lamb was closing in.
We needed a fall guy.

949
01:29:25,317 --> 01:29:26,735
With you caught red-handed...

950
01:29:26,985 --> 01:29:28,069
...we were free and clear.

951
01:29:28,445 --> 01:29:29,654
We? Who's we?

952
01:29:30,196 --> 01:29:31,072
I can't-

953
01:29:31,698 --> 01:29:32,407
Who?

954
01:29:33,783 --> 01:29:35,410
If I tell you, he'll kill me.

955
01:29:35,869 --> 01:29:37,579
He won't have a chance.
Pick it up.

956
01:29:37,954 --> 01:29:40,123
Come on. Let's go. Pick it up.

957
01:29:40,832 --> 01:29:42,918
On your feet.
Let's go!

958
01:29:45,295 --> 01:29:46,087
Pick them up!

959
01:29:47,839 --> 01:29:49,216
I got it!

960
01:30:23,041 --> 01:30:24,000
Hold it!

961
01:30:33,885 --> 01:30:35,136
Shooter on the roof!

962
01:30:35,512 --> 01:30:36,930
I think it's Chen.

963
01:31:47,918 --> 01:31:50,795
Drop it or I'll drop you!
Do it!

964
01:31:56,134 --> 01:31:59,179
Put your hands on your head!

965
01:31:59,471 --> 01:32:01,348
It's safe. We've got the shooter.

966
01:32:01,806 --> 01:32:03,141
Head for the front gate!

967
01:32:03,683 --> 01:32:04,684
Copy that.

968
01:32:07,479 --> 01:32:08,396
Where are you?

969
01:32:08,688 --> 01:32:10,148
We're coming into Queens now.

970
01:32:11,149 --> 01:32:14,819
Sheridan's headed toward the front gate
in a black Lincoln. Try to stop him.

971
01:32:15,862 --> 01:32:17,364
We'll be there!

972
01:32:20,533 --> 01:32:22,244
What really happened there?

973
01:32:24,329 --> 01:32:25,622
Hell with this.

974
01:32:25,956 --> 01:32:27,165
Just forget it.

975
01:32:44,558 --> 01:32:45,517
Here we go.

976
01:33:08,832 --> 01:33:10,750
Come on. Come on!

977
01:33:14,379 --> 01:33:17,090
We cut him off at the gate.
He broadsided us.

978
01:33:17,591 --> 01:33:19,384
He's heading north along the east wall.

979
01:33:35,734 --> 01:33:36,651
Give me your hand!

980
01:33:46,244 --> 01:33:47,495
Come on! Come on!

981
01:33:50,624 --> 01:33:52,751
- Let me go.
- I won't leave without you.

982
01:33:53,251 --> 01:33:54,502
I can't make it.

983
01:33:55,253 --> 01:33:57,130
We won't make it.

984
01:33:57,756 --> 01:33:58,882
Please go.

985
01:34:01,885 --> 01:34:03,511
Please go.

986
01:34:15,565 --> 01:34:17,734
Sheridan's over the wall.
Cover the street.

987
01:34:18,109 --> 01:34:19,361
I'm on my way!

988
01:34:22,280 --> 01:34:23,573
- Cuff this girl.
- Down!

989
01:34:33,291 --> 01:34:35,418
I see him. I'm on him.

990
01:35:44,195 --> 01:35:46,531
We're in back of the Lorali Building.
He's inside.

991
01:35:46,781 --> 01:35:49,117
Get the cops.
Seal it off.

992
01:36:16,728 --> 01:36:18,063
- Where'd he go?
- This way!

993
01:36:19,397 --> 01:36:21,149
Wait for the cops!

994
01:36:22,734 --> 01:36:23,860
Back up.

995
01:36:59,229 --> 01:37:01,147
Wait! Wait!

996
01:37:17,539 --> 01:37:19,249
Sam, is everything okay?

997
01:37:21,293 --> 01:37:22,294
Do you copy?

998
01:37:40,312 --> 01:37:43,565
You're all right. You won't be hurt.
Are you in here alone?

999
01:37:43,982 --> 01:37:44,858
Yes.

1000
01:37:51,156 --> 01:37:52,741
They're here. Coming up.

1001
01:37:54,659 --> 01:37:56,411
Seal and evacuate the building.

1002
01:38:14,763 --> 01:38:16,264
U.S. Deputy Marshal.
You alone?

1003
01:38:16,598 --> 01:38:17,682
Yes.

1004
01:38:36,117 --> 01:38:37,035
Relax.

1005
01:39:44,019 --> 01:39:45,061
Get back.

1006
01:39:51,276 --> 01:39:52,777
Oh, Jesus, kid.

1007
01:39:56,865 --> 01:40:00,744
This is Gerard, room 814. I need an
ambulance. Newman has been shot.

1008
01:40:04,206 --> 01:40:05,081
What happened?

1009
01:40:05,415 --> 01:40:09,211
Sheridan got a shot off. Newman came in
and he just walked right into it.

1010
01:40:09,502 --> 01:40:10,712
Walked right into it.

1011
01:40:12,005 --> 01:40:13,048
Don't move. Don't talk.

1012
01:40:13,423 --> 01:40:14,591
Don't move, don't talk.

1013
01:40:15,300 --> 01:40:16,801
You copy?
I need an ambulance.

1014
01:40:18,678 --> 01:40:20,889
Get your EMS people up here now.

1015
01:40:23,141 --> 01:40:25,227
Hold this rag on this kid.

1016
01:41:32,586 --> 01:41:33,712
Turn it around!

1017
01:41:34,004 --> 01:41:36,214
Get down from there and face me!

1018
01:41:36,631 --> 01:41:37,674
You'll have to shoot me.

1019
01:41:40,093 --> 01:41:40,886
Turn around!

1020
01:41:47,142 --> 01:41:48,643
I can't. I can't be caught.

1021
01:43:17,190 --> 01:43:20,485
This is unit 115. We're en route
with a 32-year-old male.

1022
01:43:20,902 --> 01:43:23,446
Multiple gunshot wounds to the chest.
ETA: 5 minutes.

1023
01:43:24,197 --> 01:43:25,615
Hey, partner, can you hear me?

1024
01:43:27,158 --> 01:43:28,285
His name is Noah.

1025
01:43:28,660 --> 01:43:29,786
Noah, can you hear me?

1026
01:43:30,453 --> 01:43:31,621
He's in fib.

1027
01:43:53,018 --> 01:43:53,935
You got it?

1028
01:43:57,188 --> 01:43:59,816
- Does he have a chance?
- No, we lost him.

1029
01:45:44,337 --> 01:45:47,632
This is Linda Carlton outside
the U.S. Mission to the U.N.

1030
01:45:47,924 --> 01:45:52,095
Many details are still unclear,
but we can now confirm...

1031
01:45:52,554 --> 01:45:55,432
...that Special Agent Frank Barrows...

1032
01:45:55,724 --> 01:45:59,311
...was killed at Queens Hill Cemetery
during a stakeout...

1033
01:45:59,644 --> 01:46:03,899
...to capture fugitive Mark Sheridan,
suspect in 2 murders...

1034
01:46:04,316 --> 01:46:06,568
...at the U.N. 6 months ago.

1035
01:46:07,110 --> 01:46:12,032
Though unconfirmed, sources report
Barrows may be implicated...

1036
01:46:12,365 --> 01:46:16,494
...with Sheridan for selling top-secret
documents to the Chinese government.

1037
01:46:16,786 --> 01:46:19,497
Deputy U. S. Marshal Noah Newman
was also killed...

1038
01:46:19,789 --> 01:46:22,918
...as Sheridan eluded police
in a spectacular escape...

1039
01:46:23,210 --> 01:46:26,213
...leaping onto the roof of a
moving subway, then stealing a car.

1040
01:46:26,504 --> 01:46:30,133
He'll say „Diplomatic immunity. „
All we can do is deport him.

1041
01:46:30,592 --> 01:46:33,470
Antonio Kimber, one of our kites,
said he was instructed...

1042
01:46:33,762 --> 01:46:36,598
...to make the exchange.
Phone records check out.

1043
01:46:37,057 --> 01:46:39,184
He was paged from Barrows'
office this morning.

1044
01:46:39,893 --> 01:46:41,937
He didn't cheat, he didn't lie.
He didn't use me.

1045
01:46:42,395 --> 01:46:43,271
I let him go.

1046
01:47:04,668 --> 01:47:05,961
I'm so sorry.

1047
01:47:18,932 --> 01:47:20,475
We found an abandoned car...

1048
01:47:20,850 --> 01:47:24,771
...in a park in Jersey near the
Holland Tunnel. This was on the seat.

1049
01:47:26,106 --> 01:47:29,192
We got half a latent.
Sheridan's right index.

1050
01:47:31,027 --> 01:47:32,362
Good work, Henry.

1051
01:47:46,001 --> 01:47:47,544
Something I can help you find?

1052
01:47:54,259 --> 01:47:55,552
Tetralezine...

1053
01:47:55,844 --> 01:47:57,846
...for motion sickness.

1054
01:48:07,022 --> 01:48:08,940
- Where the hell are you?
- Put Kim on.

1055
01:48:09,900 --> 01:48:11,234
Line two. Hold on.

1056
01:48:12,611 --> 01:48:14,029
Any ships leaving...

1057
01:48:14,321 --> 01:48:16,823
- ... where we found the car?
- Only freighters and containers.

1058
01:48:17,240 --> 01:48:19,534
- Any with passenger berths?
- I'll check.

1059
01:48:21,077 --> 01:48:22,621
Sozel Shipping has a freighter.

1060
01:48:22,913 --> 01:48:26,499
The Utviken, loading grain in Bayonne.
It's leaving tonight.

1061
01:48:26,750 --> 01:48:28,376
3 passengers, no names.

1062
01:48:28,668 --> 01:48:31,671
Immigration didn't require it.
Heading up through Canada.

1063
01:48:33,465 --> 01:48:34,966
Get me a helicopter.

1064
01:48:35,634 --> 01:48:36,593
You got it.

1065
01:48:39,971 --> 01:48:41,014
Where's he going?

1066
01:48:43,266 --> 01:48:46,269
- I'll call Bayonne PD for backup.
- I don't need them.

1067
01:48:46,519 --> 01:48:47,771
- I'll go with you.
- No.

1068
01:48:48,063 --> 01:48:50,815
What's the matter with you?
You can't do this.

1069
01:48:51,107 --> 01:48:54,069
I know how you feel,
I loved that kid too.

1070
01:48:54,444 --> 01:48:56,112
But this is wrong.

1071
01:48:57,489 --> 01:48:58,990
I'm telling you as a friend.

1072
01:48:59,407 --> 01:49:00,325
I'm not your friend.

1073
01:49:02,118 --> 01:49:03,161
Fine. Forget it.

1074
01:49:04,663 --> 01:49:06,706
You want to kill Sheridan,
go ahead.

1075
01:49:06,998 --> 01:49:10,126
But remember this: You forget
everything you taught me about this job.

1076
01:49:10,460 --> 01:49:12,587
The rules, the regulations, the code.

1077
01:49:12,837 --> 01:49:16,132
You do this, and it's all about you.
It's not about Newman. It's about you.

1078
01:49:16,424 --> 01:49:17,676
The great Sam Gerard.

1079
01:49:17,968 --> 01:49:19,261
Yes, I am.

1080
01:49:20,554 --> 01:49:22,264
You always have to win.

1081
01:49:22,514 --> 01:49:24,057
Yes, I do.

1082
01:49:35,026 --> 01:49:36,486
Want to kill him?

1083
01:49:36,987 --> 01:49:37,821
Let's go!

1084
01:50:08,810 --> 01:50:09,936
Do you hear me?

1085
01:50:11,104 --> 01:50:14,065
Look right down there.
Off to the right.

1086
01:50:14,983 --> 01:50:18,236
- That's it?
- The freighter with all the lights.

1087
01:50:18,528 --> 01:50:19,863
We'll take her down.

1088
01:50:43,470 --> 01:50:45,513
Yeah, that's him.

1089
01:50:46,514 --> 01:50:48,475
Supposed to be a couple.
Only one showed up.

1090
01:50:48,767 --> 01:50:49,643
Where?

1091
01:50:50,268 --> 01:50:52,520
Cabin 4, C-Deck.

1092
01:51:25,929 --> 01:51:26,805
Freeze!

1093
01:55:02,771 --> 01:55:03,855
Know what?

1094
01:55:05,232 --> 01:55:06,483
You look like hell.

1095
01:55:06,775 --> 01:55:09,277
I'm tired.
I'm beat up.

1096
01:55:11,112 --> 01:55:14,157
- Get some rest, I'll wake you.
- I'll be all right.

1097
01:55:18,912 --> 01:55:20,956
That must be the gun that shot Newman.

1098
01:55:37,138 --> 01:55:38,807
I see you went with the Glock.

1099
01:55:42,811 --> 01:55:43,812
Just like yours.

1100
01:55:47,232 --> 01:55:48,316
Can I see it?

1101
01:55:51,987 --> 01:55:52,863
Kind of, sort of...

1102
01:55:53,113 --> 01:55:55,490
...want to emulate you,
you being my mentor and all.

1103
01:55:58,910 --> 01:56:00,662
These things are so cool.

1104
01:56:01,288 --> 01:56:02,706
They shoot underwater.

1105
01:56:03,331 --> 01:56:04,833
Pour sand in them, they'll shoot.

1106
01:56:07,961 --> 01:56:10,505
Shoot every time.
Good choice.

1107
01:56:13,174 --> 01:56:15,552
- Get some rest.
- I'll just get some coffee.

1108
01:56:18,972 --> 01:56:20,223
You want some?

1109
01:56:23,435 --> 01:56:24,895
Black. Four sugars.

1110
01:56:25,186 --> 01:56:26,688
This is a first.

1111
01:56:27,480 --> 01:56:29,774
You must be truly exhausted.

1112
01:56:33,528 --> 01:56:34,863
Stairway down.
Nursing station.

1113
01:56:35,447 --> 01:56:37,073
Remember? Second floor.

1114
01:56:58,011 --> 01:56:59,221
Officer?

1115
01:57:02,515 --> 01:57:06,269
I need you to log this in
with evidence tech ASAP.

1116
01:57:06,728 --> 01:57:07,896
What about him?

1117
01:57:09,689 --> 01:57:11,942
I'm DSS. I can keep an eye on him.

1118
01:57:12,234 --> 01:57:13,235
Thanks.

1119
01:58:00,448 --> 01:58:01,283
Remember me?

1120
01:58:06,538 --> 01:58:07,914
You are really...

1121
01:58:08,206 --> 01:58:10,333
...on my very last...

1122
01:58:10,917 --> 01:58:11,918
...nerve.

1123
01:58:12,252 --> 01:58:16,256
You've been a mind-boggling
pain in my ass.

1124
01:58:17,757 --> 01:58:20,302
Why couldn't you just die
at the cemetery?

1125
01:58:21,303 --> 01:58:23,013
Or on the plane?

1126
01:58:27,309 --> 01:58:29,644
Cut yourself out of the rest
if you want.

1127
01:58:31,938 --> 01:58:32,814
Sit up.

1128
01:58:34,441 --> 01:58:37,444
You know the job.
You had the same training.

1129
01:58:38,278 --> 01:58:39,529
We eliminate threats.

1130
01:58:39,779 --> 01:58:41,740
You are the threat.

1131
01:58:42,282 --> 01:58:43,283
Guess what?

1132
01:58:45,452 --> 01:58:47,204
I'm down to my last option here.

1133
01:58:53,627 --> 01:58:56,213
It was you.
You set me up.

1134
01:58:56,504 --> 01:58:57,505
You were the traitor.

1135
01:58:58,131 --> 01:59:01,009
Yeah. I'm the man, Mark.
You're the delivery boy.

1136
01:59:01,301 --> 01:59:04,846
I needed a fall guy to make the bag drop
in case things went south.

1137
01:59:05,597 --> 01:59:08,642
Like the two DDS agents
you gunned down at the U.N.

1138
01:59:08,975 --> 01:59:10,352
Their blood is on your hands.

1139
01:59:10,644 --> 01:59:13,521
If it's any consolation,
I chose you because you're the best.

1140
01:59:13,813 --> 01:59:16,566
That was my mistake.
But I'm going to fix it now.

1141
01:59:17,484 --> 01:59:19,945
You'll put that knife down
like a good boy and-

1142
01:59:25,575 --> 01:59:26,618
Good night.

1143
01:59:27,661 --> 01:59:28,703
What are you doing?

1144
01:59:30,497 --> 01:59:33,083
- He tried to escape.
- Better shoot him, then.

1145
01:59:34,125 --> 01:59:35,544
Want to use your old gun?

1146
01:59:38,296 --> 01:59:39,548
It's Sheridan's.

1147
01:59:40,382 --> 01:59:43,260
No, it's yours.
You filed off the serial number.

1148
01:59:43,510 --> 01:59:45,262
The gun he took from you...

1149
01:59:45,637 --> 01:59:48,390
...the gun he shot me with.
The one you've carried since.

1150
01:59:48,682 --> 01:59:52,394
I bet the bullets we pulled from my
vest match those that killed Newman.

1151
01:59:54,980 --> 01:59:56,898
Why did you shoot that boy?

1152
01:59:59,025 --> 02:00:00,944
Didn't have a choice, really, Sam.

1153
02:00:01,236 --> 02:00:03,738
He interrupted while I tried
to put 2 into Sheridan.

1154
02:00:07,200 --> 02:00:08,159
Kind of like you.

1155
02:00:11,413 --> 02:00:14,749
What'll your story be?
You caught me turning him loose?

1156
02:00:17,168 --> 02:00:18,670
I'll think of something.

1157
02:00:23,049 --> 02:00:24,301
I got yours, you got mine.

1158
02:00:37,272 --> 02:00:40,108
You'll just have to
cuff me and take me in.

1159
02:01:00,754 --> 02:01:03,506
Welcome home, Mark.
You want to start running again?

1160
02:01:09,596 --> 02:01:11,681
I'm going back to bed.

1161
02:01:19,731 --> 02:01:24,152
Marshal Walsh, is it true that Mark
Sheridan was exonerated by this hearing?

1162
02:01:24,611 --> 02:01:25,779
After considering the facts...

1163
02:01:26,154 --> 02:01:28,990
...the U.S. Attorney's Office
has decided...

1164
02:01:29,282 --> 02:01:33,078
...to drop all charges against
Mr. Sheridan. He is...

1165
02:01:33,411 --> 02:01:34,788
...free to go.

1166
02:01:35,121 --> 02:01:36,373
How does it feel?

1167
02:01:36,665 --> 02:01:38,291
Righteous. Very righteous.

1168
02:01:39,125 --> 02:01:40,168
Do you have anything to add?

1169
02:01:48,009 --> 02:01:50,095
For what it's worth,
I'm sorry I shot you.

1170
02:01:50,428 --> 02:01:51,972
That's okay.

1171
02:01:56,726 --> 02:01:58,103
Everything's back to normal.

1172
02:01:58,562 --> 02:01:59,938
God, I hope not.

1173
02:02:06,778 --> 02:02:08,071
Excuse me.

1174
02:02:32,304 --> 02:02:36,266
They could use a night on the town.
Take them out and have fun.

1175
02:02:36,975 --> 02:02:39,603
Go on. That's an order. Go on.

1176
02:02:41,855 --> 02:02:43,607
Can you handle that?

1177
02:02:43,857 --> 02:02:44,733
Yeah.

1178
02:03:00,749 --> 02:03:01,833
You owe me an apology.

1179
02:03:02,709 --> 02:03:04,419
Yeah, I know.

1180
02:03:04,920 --> 02:03:05,795
Cosmo, I know.

1181
02:03:06,171 --> 02:03:07,130
But...

1182
02:03:10,926 --> 02:03:12,010
But what?

1183
02:03:14,679 --> 02:03:16,181
I don't even like you.

1184
02:03:21,061 --> 02:03:24,272
Let's go drink a toast to
Deputy Noah Newman.

1185
02:03:24,606 --> 02:03:27,484
If we're going to drink to Newman,
we better use milk.

1186
02:03:27,859 --> 02:03:30,487
- You still owe me for the jogging suit.
- Of course.

1187
02:03:30,779 --> 02:03:32,822
Make out a requisition in quadruplicate.

1188
02:03:33,073 --> 02:03:35,283
You'll need a white copy,
yellow copy...

1189
