1
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:42,897
What the hell you trying to do,
kill yourself?

2
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:48,068
- There's something down there.
- What was it?

3
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:50,154
I don't know.

4
00:08:50,322 --> 00:08:52,656
Something grabbed my arm,
twisted me around.

5
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:54,825
Almost pulled my arm off.

6
00:08:58,121 --> 00:08:59,955
Here. Give me this.

7
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:06,003
Listen, I told you,
you gotta stay with me.

8
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:15,971
David, I panicked.

9
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:19,225
Well, listen, you can't panic.

10
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,602
You just gotta learn to relax...

11
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,771
...and control yourself.

12
00:09:33,157 --> 00:09:35,367
- You all right?
- Yeah.

13
00:09:39,873 --> 00:09:42,667
Actually, David, it's my foot.

14
00:09:42,834 --> 00:09:45,169
Damn thing bit off my entire foot.

15
00:09:45,337 --> 00:09:47,630
Look, it's just a bloody stump.

16
00:09:57,266 --> 00:10:04,230
I almost drowned.

17
00:10:05,774 --> 00:10:09,527
We might as well be married
for all the concern I get around here.

18
00:10:21,873 --> 00:10:24,041
You wanna go dive naked?

19
00:10:24,543 --> 00:10:27,211
In the bathtub, in the hotel?

20
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:55,156
Gail, hey, look.

21
00:10:57,492 --> 00:11:00,036
- Look at this.
- What is it?

22
00:11:00,203 --> 00:11:02,079
I don't know.

23
00:11:02,247 --> 00:11:04,373
Looks like a coin.

24
00:11:32,196 --> 00:11:35,448
- I'm gonna take a shower.
- Okay, babe.

25
00:11:43,248 --> 00:11:47,210
Goliath? I thought you said
you were diving on the Brighton.

26
00:11:49,505 --> 00:11:51,923
We did dive the Brighton...

27
00:11:52,091 --> 00:11:54,467
...then we spotted that wreck
off the point...

28
00:11:54,635 --> 00:11:58,638
...so we decided we'd take a look.
It wasn't in the guidebook.

29
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,642
Damn right it's not.
Goliath's full of munitions.

30
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:05,645
Tourists aren't allowed
to blow themselves up, you know.

31
00:12:05,813 --> 00:12:07,063
Oh, yeah?

32
00:12:08,315 --> 00:12:10,024
Yeah.

33
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:08,834
Can't believe the stuff
this Romer Treece...

34
00:13:09,002 --> 00:13:11,211
...has found off the coast
around here.

35
00:13:11,504 --> 00:13:13,422
I can believe it.

36
00:13:14,716 --> 00:13:17,009
- What have we found out?
- Well, I don't know.

37
00:13:17,719 --> 00:13:21,890
"O.P.N." means ora pro nobis,
"pray for us"...

38
00:13:22,057 --> 00:13:24,559
...and "S.C."
I can't find in any of these.

39
00:13:25,978 --> 00:13:29,063
You know, if I'd wanted to spend
my holiday in the library...

40
00:13:29,231 --> 00:13:31,733
...I could've walked 10 blocks
to 42nd Street.

41
00:13:33,068 --> 00:13:36,112
- Let's approach this methodically.
- I'd love to play tennis.

42
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,990
- Our coin is dated 1714, right?
- You're not listening.

43
00:13:39,158 --> 00:13:41,493
The only ships that went down
in that period...

44
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:44,078
...were King Philip's fleet in 1715.
- Ping-Pong?

45
00:13:44,246 --> 00:13:47,916
Now, that's fantastic
because there's 30 million in gold.

46
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:49,709
Okay.

47
00:13:49,877 --> 00:13:52,086
I'm gonna play tennis with a pro.

48
00:14:03,098 --> 00:14:04,516
No.

49
00:14:07,102 --> 00:14:08,520
All right.

50
00:14:24,412 --> 00:14:26,455
- What are you gonna have?
- Wine, madam?

51
00:14:26,623 --> 00:14:27,873
No, thank you.

52
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:31,418
- Would you care for some more, sir?
- Thank you.

53
00:14:31,586 --> 00:14:34,630
- Would you like some dessert?
- No, thank you.

54
00:14:36,716 --> 00:14:40,636
It was about here, outside the wreck,
that I almost had my arm torn off.

55
00:14:40,804 --> 00:14:42,429
All right, if you were there...

56
00:14:42,597 --> 00:14:45,099
...I was across the hull
in about 80 feet of water...

57
00:14:45,267 --> 00:14:47,476
...and that's where I found that coin...

58
00:14:49,813 --> 00:14:50,980
Hello.

59
00:14:51,147 --> 00:14:54,650
You must be the young couple
who found that bottle this afternoon?

60
00:14:54,818 --> 00:14:58,571
Smallish, three inches long, tapered?

61
00:15:00,031 --> 00:15:02,449
It could be Reinhardt glass,
you know...

62
00:15:02,617 --> 00:15:04,994
...from Rotterdam, before the war.

63
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:09,415
- It certainly didn't look like anything...
- We didn't find any bottle.

64
00:15:10,834 --> 00:15:11,834
Yeah.

65
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,839
We...

66
00:15:18,509 --> 00:15:21,803
My name is Henri Bondurant,
a jeweller by trade.

67
00:15:21,971 --> 00:15:27,517
By avocation, a collector
of rare and unusual glass.

68
00:15:27,685 --> 00:15:30,979
You see, the government here...

69
00:15:31,147 --> 00:15:33,148
...has rather strict rules
about diving.

70
00:15:33,316 --> 00:15:35,817
Legally, you cannot take anything
off Bermuda...

71
00:15:35,985 --> 00:15:39,446
...unless you first offer to sell it
to the government and are declined.

72
00:15:39,614 --> 00:15:42,616
Unfortunately, the government
rarely ever does decline...

73
00:15:42,783 --> 00:15:46,161
...and even more rarely
offers premium prices.

74
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,042
- What'd you say your name was?
- Bondurant. Bondurant.

75
00:15:52,209 --> 00:15:58,006
Well, I am sorry. This is fascinating,
but what does it have to do with us?

76
00:16:00,677 --> 00:16:02,970
Let me tell you something.

77
00:16:03,138 --> 00:16:06,557
If that bottle
is a genuine Reinhardt...

78
00:16:06,725 --> 00:16:10,394
...it would be a small coup
for a collector like myself.

79
00:16:10,562 --> 00:16:12,730
- I would be prepared to offer...
- I'm sorry.

80
00:16:12,898 --> 00:16:15,733
I'm sorry. I told you,
we don't have any bottle.

81
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:23,407
In that case...

82
00:16:24,076 --> 00:16:27,244
...my apologies for having
interrupted your conversation.

83
00:16:28,163 --> 00:16:33,000
Good night.

84
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:37,254
Jesus. Who was that?

85
00:16:38,507 --> 00:16:41,175
Some dynamite businessman.
You could have listened.

86
00:16:41,343 --> 00:16:45,429
Well... Come on, Gail.
Bottle collector, my ass.

87
00:17:25,555 --> 00:17:27,139
Do you think this is it?

88
00:17:28,266 --> 00:17:30,767
Well, it isn't a bloody tourist trap.

89
00:17:31,811 --> 00:17:32,978
What do you want?

90
00:17:33,146 --> 00:17:34,813
- Mr. Treece?
- Indeed.

91
00:17:34,981 --> 00:17:37,400
Well, Mr. Treece, a friend of ours...

92
00:17:37,568 --> 00:17:40,528
...was doing some diving around here
about a month ago...

93
00:17:40,696 --> 00:17:44,240
...and found a Spanish coin
that was dated 1714...

94
00:17:44,408 --> 00:17:46,159
...and he told us to talk to you.

95
00:17:46,326 --> 00:17:48,828
- Look it up in the Hamilton library.
- Yeah, we did.

96
00:17:48,996 --> 00:17:51,956
We talked to the librarian
and she said for us to come here...

97
00:17:52,124 --> 00:17:54,083
...and talk to you
because you'd help us.

98
00:17:54,251 --> 00:17:56,586
Yes, well, she's a stupid woman...

99
00:17:56,754 --> 00:17:59,297
...but she's kind, you know.
Quite kind.

100
00:17:59,465 --> 00:18:01,507
She still growing her moustache?

101
00:18:06,263 --> 00:18:08,806
It's all right. Come on in.
Let's see what you got.

102
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:19,525
Come on over, then.

103
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:22,111
But you haven't been
asked for lunch.

104
00:18:26,533 --> 00:18:28,117
Thank you.

105
00:19:03,071 --> 00:19:05,405
Well, it ain't no coin, boy.

106
00:19:05,573 --> 00:19:07,407
It's a Spanish medallion.

107
00:19:07,575 --> 00:19:09,409
It's a medallion?

108
00:19:10,411 --> 00:19:12,162
Beginner's luck.

109
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:15,667
If this hadn't laid against iron,
it would've oxidized long ago...

110
00:19:15,835 --> 00:19:18,086
...and you'd have nothing.
- Right.

111
00:19:18,254 --> 00:19:22,423
We couldn't figure out the inscription,
ora pro nobis, and S.C. In front of it.

112
00:19:22,591 --> 00:19:24,425
"Santa Clara, pray for us."

113
00:19:24,593 --> 00:19:28,137
That was common enough
an inscription in those days.

114
00:19:31,058 --> 00:19:33,685
- There you are, boy.
- Is it valuable?

115
00:19:33,853 --> 00:19:36,771
One medallion? No, not to me.

116
00:19:37,898 --> 00:19:39,774
Must be one of
King Philip's treasure.

117
00:19:39,942 --> 00:19:42,277
That's the only fleet that went down
in that time.

118
00:19:42,444 --> 00:19:45,780
No, not unless it walked itself
across the ocean for 800 miles.

119
00:19:45,948 --> 00:19:48,449
That fleet went down
in a hurricane off Florida...

120
00:19:48,617 --> 00:19:51,119
...all 11 of them, 1715.

121
00:19:51,287 --> 00:19:53,621
That's all documented
and proven in my library.

122
00:19:53,789 --> 00:19:56,958
We've already found El Capitano,
Ubilla's flagship.

123
00:19:57,126 --> 00:19:59,794
Obviously, there's something
down here, isn't there?

124
00:19:59,962 --> 00:20:03,506
Well, now, just hang on a minute, boy.
You just found one trinket.

125
00:20:03,674 --> 00:20:06,676
Might pay for your holiday,
if you don't drink too much.

126
00:20:06,844 --> 00:20:09,345
On the other hand,
it might have fallen overboard...

127
00:20:09,513 --> 00:20:12,098
...dropped there by some
drunken old rummy one night.

128
00:20:12,266 --> 00:20:14,642
What else have you got
in there, then?

129
00:20:22,902 --> 00:20:25,778
Hey, boy, this is Goliath trash.

130
00:20:25,946 --> 00:20:28,281
What the hell
were you doing diving down there?

131
00:20:28,449 --> 00:20:31,826
We spotted the wreck off the point
so we dived down.

132
00:20:38,834 --> 00:20:41,002
Where'd you get this, exactly?

133
00:20:48,845 --> 00:20:51,138
Right about here,
just outside the wreck.

134
00:20:51,306 --> 00:20:52,849
Are you quite sure?

135
00:20:53,017 --> 00:20:55,268
Water plays strange tricks
sometimes, you know.

136
00:20:55,436 --> 00:20:58,188
Makes things look bigger, smaller,
wrong way around.

137
00:20:58,356 --> 00:21:00,315
- Sure it was right there?
- I'm positive.

138
00:21:00,483 --> 00:21:03,026
There certainly are a lot
of glass freaks in Bermuda.

139
00:21:03,194 --> 00:21:05,320
Somebody else
know about this, then?

140
00:21:08,366 --> 00:21:10,367
Last night,
a bald guy came up at dinner.

141
00:21:10,534 --> 00:21:13,787
He said he was a glass collector.
He described that perfectly.

142
00:21:14,747 --> 00:21:16,498
I didn't show it to him.

143
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:19,876
Looked like a basketball player.

144
00:21:20,211 --> 00:21:22,170
Henri Bondurant, a French guy.

145
00:21:22,338 --> 00:21:24,130
No, he's Haitian.

146
00:21:24,298 --> 00:21:29,094
And, boy, could I just have another
little look at that medallion there?

147
00:21:29,637 --> 00:21:31,012
Yeah.

148
00:21:31,889 --> 00:21:36,226
I think I might just've
missed something here.

149
00:21:36,394 --> 00:21:40,146
Come over here and let's have a look
at this magnifying glass.

150
00:21:43,442 --> 00:21:44,776
Yeah.

151
00:21:46,404 --> 00:21:48,196
- Now, you see those letters here?
- Yes.

152
00:21:48,364 --> 00:21:49,698
Not your normal mint mark.

153
00:21:49,865 --> 00:21:51,825
That might be the mark
of the engraver...

154
00:21:51,993 --> 00:21:54,494
...or it might be the person
who had it made up.

155
00:21:54,662 --> 00:21:56,538
I'm sure of one thing.

156
00:21:56,914 --> 00:21:59,708
It's made up for somebody special.

157
00:22:00,835 --> 00:22:03,461
Then it might be worth
another look down there?

158
00:22:03,629 --> 00:22:08,591
Yes. Well, as I said, it might,
but not to me.

159
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:10,927
Thank you.
Sorry you can't stay for lunch.

160
00:22:11,095 --> 00:22:13,179
Wait a minute, Mr. Treece.
That's all?

161
00:22:13,347 --> 00:22:15,432
- Come on, David. Let's go.
- Just a sec.

162
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:18,018
You might not mind
wasting any more of your time...

163
00:22:18,185 --> 00:22:20,020
...but I can't have you wasting mine.

164
00:22:20,187 --> 00:22:21,938
You said there was
something special.

165
00:22:22,106 --> 00:22:24,649
- Let's go take a look.
- Good afternoon.

166
00:22:57,101 --> 00:22:58,810
You okay?

167
00:23:09,822 --> 00:23:11,364
Gail.

168
00:23:12,575 --> 00:23:13,950
Go right.

169
00:23:19,874 --> 00:23:22,501
I wonder what the hell
this guy's doing.

170
00:23:25,088 --> 00:23:26,838
David!

171
00:23:30,343 --> 00:23:31,968
Try and pull over.

172
00:23:32,512 --> 00:23:33,762
I can't!

173
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:47,150
David!

174
00:24:43,418 --> 00:24:45,586
- David?
- Yeah?

175
00:24:57,932 --> 00:25:00,601
Should have sold me that bottle.

176
00:25:01,269 --> 00:25:04,897
Now you force me to take
what you would not let me pay for.

177
00:25:07,942 --> 00:25:11,111
Well, if it'll ease your mind,
I'll still name a price.

178
00:25:15,491 --> 00:25:17,743
Take off their blindfolds.

179
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:58,117
Look, if it's not in the bag,
I don't know where in the hell it is.

180
00:26:02,414 --> 00:26:05,500
- The girl.
- Look, she hasn't got it...

181
00:26:06,585 --> 00:26:08,503
If his tongue moves again,
cut it.

182
00:26:51,172 --> 00:26:52,881
I'll do it.

183
00:28:09,377 --> 00:28:11,044
Put it back on.

184
00:28:22,682 --> 00:28:24,975
Since neither of you
seem to have that bottle...

185
00:28:25,143 --> 00:28:28,813
...I must assume it is now
the property of Romer Treece.

186
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:31,941
Well, then, for Christ's sake,
let him go.

187
00:28:36,071 --> 00:28:39,490
It hasn't been all that pleasant for you,
has it, Mr. Sanders?

188
00:28:40,659 --> 00:28:43,327
Enjoy yourselves this evening.

189
00:28:43,829 --> 00:28:45,913
Eat a good dinner...

190
00:28:46,081 --> 00:28:48,374
...go dancing.

191
00:28:49,334 --> 00:28:52,837
But be off the island by tomorrow.

192
00:29:03,933 --> 00:29:05,684
Treece.

193
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:09,312
Come on, Treece.

194
00:29:10,606 --> 00:29:13,525
All right, Treece.
What the hell's going on?

195
00:29:13,693 --> 00:29:15,193
Take it up.

196
00:29:15,361 --> 00:29:17,112
Listen, I'll look after this.

197
00:29:20,032 --> 00:29:21,575
Okay.

198
00:29:25,371 --> 00:29:27,706
- Hold it.
- Coffin?

199
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:36,131
He's the only man alive who might
know one of these ampoules on sight.

200
00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:37,966
Can I show him your map, please?

201
00:29:38,134 --> 00:29:41,178
He was the sole survivor
of the Goliath, you see.

202
00:29:45,641 --> 00:29:47,267
Thank you.

203
00:29:49,729 --> 00:29:51,563
Now, then, Adam...

204
00:29:52,023 --> 00:29:54,983
...this one of your
legendary ampoules?

205
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:07,078
This is the real thing, all right.

206
00:30:10,167 --> 00:30:13,503
The old girl's
finally lost her virginity.

207
00:30:14,254 --> 00:30:16,839
My friends found it there.

208
00:30:21,011 --> 00:30:24,514
Well, the way she's lying here
a storm must've flipped her around.

209
00:30:25,098 --> 00:30:28,184
She was never this close
to the edge of the reef before.

210
00:30:30,938 --> 00:30:32,438
You're lucky.

211
00:30:32,606 --> 00:30:35,149
Five people have died
over the last 30 years...

212
00:30:35,317 --> 00:30:37,945
...trying to crawl inside that ship.

213
00:30:38,112 --> 00:30:40,697
Blew themselves up
poking torches around.

214
00:30:40,865 --> 00:30:44,284
There's enough live ammo down there
to blow up half the island.

215
00:30:44,452 --> 00:30:47,955
Oh, will somebody just cut the crap?
Blew themselves up for what?

216
00:30:48,122 --> 00:30:49,748
Goliath was a military ship, boy.

217
00:30:49,916 --> 00:30:52,793
Went down with munitions
and medical supplies.

218
00:30:52,961 --> 00:30:54,336
Or so they say.

219
00:30:54,504 --> 00:30:55,796
They're there, all right.

220
00:30:55,964 --> 00:30:57,422
All right, what's there?

221
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:06,223
Morphine, 98,000 ampoules.

222
00:31:06,391 --> 00:31:08,433
I packed them myself.

223
00:31:08,601 --> 00:31:10,852
Jesus.
Why didn't you tell us the truth?

224
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:14,231
If you had, we wouldn't have had
that run-in with that Haitian.

225
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,567
The name's Cloche.

226
00:31:16,734 --> 00:31:19,152
That you didn't know nothing's
what saved you.

227
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,989
I wasn't sure myself until now.

228
00:31:22,448 --> 00:31:24,783
The first time he's told me the truth.

229
00:31:25,159 --> 00:31:29,121
Adam, what do you reckon
to the rest of them, then?

230
00:31:31,332 --> 00:31:35,294
They're probably all smashed up
by the ordnance now.

231
00:31:37,297 --> 00:31:38,630
The way she's lying here...

232
00:31:38,798 --> 00:31:42,634
...this time there won't be any
steel plate to have to burn through.

233
00:31:42,802 --> 00:31:46,638
They've performed a bloody autopsy
on that with everything but forceps...

234
00:31:46,806 --> 00:31:48,974
...but nobody ever found
one of those before.

235
00:31:49,142 --> 00:31:50,517
Well, we found one.

236
00:31:50,685 --> 00:31:54,187
Oh, we are having a wonderful day,
aren't we, David?

237
00:31:54,355 --> 00:31:56,189
How come nobody found one
until now?

238
00:31:56,357 --> 00:31:59,234
Well, the sea's a joker, boy.
Loves to fool you.

239
00:31:59,402 --> 00:32:02,989
Dive a wreck one day, find nothing.
That night, blows up a storm...

240
00:32:03,157 --> 00:32:06,659
...go back again, same spot,
you find a carpet of golden coin.

241
00:32:06,827 --> 00:32:10,038
We just had one of the worst storms
in 10 years, haven't we, Adam?

242
00:32:10,205 --> 00:32:12,206
- Aye.
- Coffin!

243
00:32:12,374 --> 00:32:14,375
Goddamn it. Coffin.

244
00:32:14,543 --> 00:32:17,630
"Coffin. Goddamn it, Coffin."

245
00:32:18,673 --> 00:32:20,716
Nice to meet you folks.

246
00:32:30,185 --> 00:32:31,727
Mr. Treece?

247
00:32:31,895 --> 00:32:34,730
Which one of us turns this thing
over to the government?

248
00:32:37,567 --> 00:32:39,318
Well, now, miss...

249
00:32:39,486 --> 00:32:41,487
...I'm going to have to think on that.

250
00:32:42,238 --> 00:32:45,366
You see, I was never one
much to bother with formalities.

251
00:32:45,533 --> 00:32:47,743
Morphine's not exactly a formality.

252
00:32:47,911 --> 00:32:50,829
- That's halfway to heroin.
- Halfway to hell.

253
00:32:50,997 --> 00:32:54,124
I know all about that.
So does Cloche.

254
00:32:54,292 --> 00:32:57,252
By the time some Hamilton bureaucrat
gets off of his fat bum...

255
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:59,463
...it will be heroin.

256
00:33:01,549 --> 00:33:04,009
That's why I'm gonna
dive down there tonight.

257
00:33:05,303 --> 00:33:07,721
You haven't answered my question,
Mr. Treece.

258
00:33:11,768 --> 00:33:14,687
I'll answer the question. I'm turning
this over to the government.

259
00:33:14,854 --> 00:33:17,731
I'm all the government
you need, boy.

260
00:33:21,945 --> 00:33:23,904
Put that right back.

261
00:33:36,126 --> 00:33:38,585
Now, the reasons are two.
They're mine and yours.

262
00:33:38,753 --> 00:33:41,755
Mine, if there are thousands
of ampoules down there...

263
00:33:41,923 --> 00:33:44,133
...and Cloche gets his hands
on them...

264
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:47,219
...that junk will be on the street
in New York in a week.

265
00:33:47,387 --> 00:33:50,639
Yours, if you're lucky,
it's the only one left...

266
00:33:50,807 --> 00:33:54,645
...but if you go to the government,
your treasure hunt will be off...

267
00:33:54,813 --> 00:33:56,981
...and if there is any treasure
down there...

268
00:33:57,149 --> 00:34:00,860
...you'll just be reading about
somebody else finding it.

269
00:34:07,367 --> 00:34:09,326
David, please don't dive.

270
00:34:10,912 --> 00:34:12,455
Make up your own mind, boy.

271
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,666
I have made up my mind, Treece.

272
00:34:15,834 --> 00:34:17,835
I'm diving with you tonight...

273
00:34:18,003 --> 00:34:20,171
...or I'm handing over
all this information...

274
00:34:20,338 --> 00:34:22,798
...to the authorities this afternoon.

275
00:34:33,477 --> 00:34:37,188
Look, Gail, it's important to me.
You understand?

276
00:34:37,355 --> 00:34:39,440
Listen, David, it's morphine.
Morphine.

277
00:34:39,608 --> 00:34:40,983
We only met the man today.

278
00:34:41,151 --> 00:34:43,944
Don't know anything more about him
than you want to.

279
00:34:44,112 --> 00:34:46,530
I can't afford to pass it up.
It's an experience.

280
00:34:46,698 --> 00:34:48,699
Experience?
Don't you mean privilege?

281
00:34:48,867 --> 00:34:51,494
- He suckered you in like a 5-year-old.
- Wait a minute.

282
00:34:51,661 --> 00:34:53,579
I blackmailed him.
You remember that?

283
00:34:53,747 --> 00:34:57,541
- Is that the way you remember it?
- Yes, because that's the way it was.

284
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:01,879
There's treasure down there, Gail.
I know. So I gotta go look.

285
00:35:02,047 --> 00:35:04,715
You're so blind,
you couldn't see it in front of you.

286
00:35:04,883 --> 00:35:08,344
Well, look, I feel things, so I do them.
That's just the way I am.

287
00:35:08,512 --> 00:35:10,513
And you wind up with T-shirts.

288
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:15,810
Oh, Jesus.
That's unfair. That's totally unfair.

289
00:35:15,977 --> 00:35:18,604
Look, I didn't come here for you.

290
00:35:18,772 --> 00:35:20,147
I came here for us.

291
00:35:20,315 --> 00:35:22,066
So would you please think about it?

292
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:27,488
I always think about us.

293
00:35:49,638 --> 00:35:52,390
Say, who is that guy?
I don't like him at all.

294
00:35:52,558 --> 00:35:55,893
Well, you're going to have to
because that's Kevin, he's family.

295
00:35:56,061 --> 00:35:59,438
My mother liked him.
Told him to look after me.

296
00:35:59,606 --> 00:36:01,524
Put your gear in the cabin.

297
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:03,276
Well, here I am.

298
00:36:04,236 --> 00:36:07,238
I'm all ready. I've got all my gear.

299
00:36:07,406 --> 00:36:11,701
I'm sorry you had such a long walk,
because you're not diving tonight.

300
00:36:12,661 --> 00:36:14,412
The hell I'm not.

301
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:17,957
That's my ship out there.
Those are my mates.

302
00:36:18,125 --> 00:36:20,084
Your ship's dead.

303
00:36:20,252 --> 00:36:21,794
So are your mates.

304
00:36:21,962 --> 00:36:24,964
So were you too when I found you
washed up on the beach.

305
00:36:25,132 --> 00:36:28,634
And there's never bringing any of us
back again, is there?

306
00:36:28,802 --> 00:36:30,553
You just go on home now.

307
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:32,388
Good night.

308
00:36:32,806 --> 00:36:35,349
- All set, captain?
- Aye.

309
00:36:48,655 --> 00:36:52,909
Full moon tonight. We're gonna
stick out like a cherry on a cream pie.

310
00:36:53,702 --> 00:36:55,995
Cast her off forward, Kev.

311
00:37:16,643 --> 00:37:18,560
Would you like some of that rum?

312
00:37:18,728 --> 00:37:20,187
Yeah.

313
00:37:26,194 --> 00:37:27,444
- There you go.
- No, thanks.

314
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:30,364
I never drink before I dive.

315
00:37:33,952 --> 00:37:36,454
You know what they say
about these waters?

316
00:37:36,622 --> 00:37:38,998
If the Jamaican pirates
don't get you...

317
00:37:39,166 --> 00:37:42,627
...it'll be the cold embrace
of the sea.

318
00:37:43,629 --> 00:37:46,214
And that's no lover's kiss.

319
00:37:49,218 --> 00:37:51,386
You know every ship
from the New World...

320
00:37:51,553 --> 00:37:54,555
...passed through these waters?
They had to.

321
00:37:55,182 --> 00:37:58,309
Kangxi porcelain from China...

322
00:37:58,477 --> 00:38:01,062
...Japanese silk screens...

323
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:04,232
...and those ivory doodads
from India.

324
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,903
And all that Inca gold
that Pizarro took out of Peru.

325
00:38:12,908 --> 00:38:15,410
Do you believe all that, boy?

326
00:38:16,745 --> 00:38:18,913
Yeah, I believe all of it.

327
00:38:19,623 --> 00:38:21,916
Every bit of it. So do you.

328
00:38:27,756 --> 00:38:30,425
You gonna marry that girl of yours?

329
00:38:44,773 --> 00:38:46,442
Hey, boy.

330
00:38:47,027 --> 00:38:48,610
We're getting very close now.

331
00:38:50,655 --> 00:38:52,948
Four dots and a dash,
that's your hotel.

332
00:38:55,785 --> 00:38:57,578
Hey, Treece.

333
00:38:58,663 --> 00:39:00,622
What do you do on a foggy night?

334
00:39:01,291 --> 00:39:04,168
I just stay home and I drink rum.

335
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:36,159
Here, give me a hand, will you?

336
00:39:46,587 --> 00:39:48,505
Hey, wait a minute.
This is explosives.

337
00:39:48,672 --> 00:39:51,341
I don't wanna have anything to do
with explosives.

338
00:39:51,509 --> 00:39:55,011
If there are thousands of ampoules
down there...

339
00:39:55,179 --> 00:39:57,055
...I'm gonna rig the Goliath...

340
00:39:57,223 --> 00:39:59,682
...so that I can topple it off the reef...

341
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:02,018
...out of anybody's reach forever.

342
00:40:02,186 --> 00:40:03,686
So, what about the treasure?

343
00:40:03,854 --> 00:40:05,688
Here, you'll need this.

344
00:40:05,856 --> 00:40:07,857
Black as molasses.

345
00:40:08,025 --> 00:40:11,194
Don't you go frightening
anything down there.

346
00:49:53,746 --> 00:49:55,455
What's wrong?

347
00:49:57,083 --> 00:49:59,000
I'm not blowing it, not now.

348
00:49:59,168 --> 00:50:01,628
That's the biggest
moray eel I ever saw.

349
00:50:01,796 --> 00:50:04,047
He wanted you for his supper.

350
00:51:35,642 --> 00:51:37,643
What's the matter, boy?

351
00:51:42,398 --> 00:51:44,149
Cheap Jack Bush.

352
00:51:44,317 --> 00:51:45,567
Warning from Cloche.

353
00:51:45,735 --> 00:51:48,446
- Cheap Jack what?
- Voodoo.

354
00:51:48,614 --> 00:51:51,324
Cloche always likes to bring in
a bit of Haiti with him.

355
00:51:51,492 --> 00:51:54,077
Anybody take any notice of this...

356
00:51:56,205 --> 00:51:58,915
...ought to have
his brain examined.

357
00:52:01,585 --> 00:52:04,254
Lights in your hotel have gone out.

358
00:52:06,632 --> 00:52:09,092
We'll run the reef
so I can drop you on the beach.

359
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:10,760
- All right.
- Get that anchor up.

360
00:52:10,928 --> 00:52:12,595
- Yeah.
- Keep a sharp eye.

361
00:52:24,233 --> 00:52:25,775
David?

362
00:52:30,281 --> 00:52:32,616
Just a minute. I put the lock on.

363
00:52:34,202 --> 00:52:35,452
David?

364
00:52:38,748 --> 00:52:40,291
Who's there?

365
00:53:02,814 --> 00:53:04,356
You gotta go starboard.

366
00:53:04,524 --> 00:53:06,358
Port. Port.

367
00:53:06,526 --> 00:53:08,444
I've been through this reef before.

368
00:53:08,612 --> 00:53:11,155
Yeah, but the hotel beach
is over there.

369
00:53:11,323 --> 00:53:14,783
I know where the bloody beach is.

370
00:53:39,352 --> 00:53:42,187
Okay, you're clear. You're clear.

371
00:55:36,596 --> 00:55:39,473
Stop. Stop.

372
00:56:33,654 --> 00:56:35,530
Goddamn it.

373
00:57:12,861 --> 00:57:14,194
Gail?

374
00:57:29,669 --> 00:57:31,753
Honey, what happened?

375
00:57:34,966 --> 00:57:37,134
I haven't...

376
00:57:41,806 --> 00:57:45,809
...felt like that...

377
00:57:45,977 --> 00:57:48,312
...in my entire life.

378
00:57:48,479 --> 00:57:52,524
- Okay.
- I was so helpless.

379
00:58:00,074 --> 00:58:02,951
- It's all right, honey.
- David.

380
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:04,953
They...

381
00:58:05,121 --> 00:58:07,956
They painted me.

382
00:58:13,339 --> 00:58:16,132
- Quiet, now.
- David.

383
00:58:17,969 --> 00:58:20,596
Come on, listen to me.
Listen. Listen.

384
00:58:20,764 --> 00:58:23,432
- I wanna go home.
- Okay, okay, baby.

385
00:58:24,517 --> 00:58:26,477
We'll go home.
We'll go home tonight.

386
00:58:26,645 --> 00:58:28,312
Boy, the airport's closed.

387
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:31,857
No way off the island.
You best come home with me.

388
00:58:32,484 --> 00:58:34,944
We're not going home with you,
Treece...

389
00:58:35,111 --> 00:58:37,821
...because it's you and it's Cloche...

390
00:58:37,989 --> 00:58:41,492
...and it's that goddamn morphine
that almost got her killed tonight.

391
00:58:42,827 --> 00:58:47,122
Boy, if Cloche wanted her dead,
we'd be digging her grave by now.

392
00:58:48,416 --> 00:58:51,252
He just wanted her
as some kind of trump card...

393
00:58:51,419 --> 00:58:54,046
...until he knew about the morphine.

394
00:58:54,798 --> 00:58:56,674
You come home with me.

395
00:58:56,841 --> 00:58:59,760
David, it's the only place
you'll be safe tonight.

396
00:59:05,684 --> 00:59:08,852
Don't worry. I'll make sure
everyone's placed properly.

397
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:11,689
Right, but you, yourself,
you watch the west side.

398
00:59:11,856 --> 00:59:14,108
Make sure nobody comes over
the swing bridge.

399
00:59:14,276 --> 00:59:17,569
If he does come,
I hope it's my bloody way.

400
00:59:18,029 --> 00:59:20,698
<i>- Kevin.
- Aye?</i>

401
00:59:20,865 --> 00:59:22,533
You just take care of yourself.

402
00:59:22,701 --> 00:59:25,911
Don't want anybody else
to be hurt tonight. Go on.

403
00:59:56,235 --> 00:59:58,069
How's your girl?

404
00:59:59,864 --> 01:00:01,782
She's asleep.

405
01:00:24,431 --> 01:00:26,515
Why didn't you blow that boat up?

406
01:00:27,684 --> 01:00:29,810
Because of what you found, boy.

407
01:00:29,978 --> 01:00:32,313
I think you ought to
have a look at this.

408
01:00:35,609 --> 01:00:37,902
Why, I never seen one
like that before.

409
01:00:38,695 --> 01:00:41,697
That's an 18th-century
escutcheon plate.

410
01:00:44,451 --> 01:00:45,993
You might be right, you see.

411
01:00:46,161 --> 01:00:49,288
There just might be
a king's ransom down there.

412
01:00:51,750 --> 01:00:53,084
It would take three keys...

413
01:00:53,251 --> 01:00:56,212
...to open the box
that that plate came from.

414
01:00:57,631 --> 01:00:59,965
Now, the captain would have one...

415
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:02,385
...the governor of Havana had two.

416
01:01:02,552 --> 01:01:05,054
The owner would have
all three in his possession...

417
01:01:05,222 --> 01:01:08,224
...so only the owner could
open them on his own, right?

418
01:01:10,018 --> 01:01:14,230
A three-key lock like that
is very rare. Very rare indeed.

419
01:01:14,398 --> 01:01:17,024
Only used on nobility business.

420
01:01:17,442 --> 01:01:19,110
What would a plate like this...

421
01:01:19,277 --> 01:01:22,571
...be doing in the hold
of a World War II munitions ship?

422
01:01:23,365 --> 01:01:27,618
Yes, well, now, I don't know.

423
01:01:29,579 --> 01:01:33,667
Suppose you have two storms...

424
01:01:33,835 --> 01:01:35,544
...hundreds of years apart...

425
01:01:35,711 --> 01:01:37,963
...springing up
from the same quarter...

426
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:41,508
...and they catch two ships
in the same circumstances...

427
01:01:41,676 --> 01:01:43,343
...making for the same shelter.

428
01:01:43,511 --> 01:01:46,304
Now, might they not
drive them up on the same reef?

429
01:01:47,890 --> 01:01:50,183
You think the current
could bring that plate...

430
01:01:50,351 --> 01:01:52,352
...up through the split in the hull?

431
01:01:54,148 --> 01:01:56,149
Why hasn't anybody
found this other ship?

432
01:01:56,316 --> 01:02:00,194
I don't know yet, but I can tell you
we'll find that in Havana manifesto.

433
01:02:00,362 --> 01:02:02,488
I've got survivors' accounts,
everything.

434
01:02:02,656 --> 01:02:06,200
I ought to be able to tell you who
that ship is, where she come from.

435
01:02:06,368 --> 01:02:09,579
These are the Spanish,
this is the English translation.

436
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:12,582
You and your beginner's luck, eh?

437
01:02:13,542 --> 01:02:14,876
Mr. Treece.

438
01:02:16,753 --> 01:02:20,756
If there is something more down there,
what would it take to bring it up?

439
01:02:21,258 --> 01:02:23,634
Well, under normal circumstances...

440
01:02:23,802 --> 01:02:26,387
...using a sand gun
and DESCO equipment...

441
01:02:26,555 --> 01:02:30,099
...clear water and a lot of luck,
just a few days.

442
01:02:30,267 --> 01:02:34,061
But that hardly applies now, does it,
since we got Cloche on our back?

443
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:37,565
- What would it take to get him off?
- Cloche?

444
01:02:37,733 --> 01:02:40,234
Any deal that gets him the morphine,
I suppose.

445
01:02:43,363 --> 01:02:45,364
But what do either of you care?

446
01:02:45,532 --> 01:02:47,366
You're both going home tomorrow.

447
01:02:47,534 --> 01:02:50,203
You'll be up to your neck
in city smut by dinnertime.

448
01:02:50,370 --> 01:02:52,538
Good God, what a world that is.

449
01:02:53,749 --> 01:02:56,709
It made me climb
the Statue of Liberty once.

450
01:03:06,428 --> 01:03:08,179
It's dreams, Treece.

451
01:03:09,181 --> 01:03:10,849
It's all daydreams.

452
01:03:12,435 --> 01:03:16,438
It's a little more than daydreams, boy,
when you find a three-lock box.

453
01:03:17,941 --> 01:03:20,943
You see, by rights,
you discovered her.

454
01:03:21,236 --> 01:03:24,279
Whoever she is,
you were the first to find her.

455
01:03:24,822 --> 01:03:29,284
You would have left that plate there
if I hadn't known it for what it was.

456
01:03:30,620 --> 01:03:33,539
So that rolls me aboard as well.

457
01:03:35,875 --> 01:03:37,751
Let me put it to you simple.

458
01:03:37,919 --> 01:03:40,629
Whatever's down there,
a lot or a little...

459
01:03:40,797 --> 01:03:42,798
...half yours, half mine.

460
01:03:42,966 --> 01:03:46,803
But the right to tell the world about it,
that's all yours.

461
01:03:56,939 --> 01:03:58,940
Come on up, okay?

462
01:03:59,733 --> 01:04:02,819
Yeah, in a minute. Yeah, I'm coming.

463
01:04:02,987 --> 01:04:04,654
Okay.

464
01:04:17,501 --> 01:04:19,419
You're still there, girl?

465
01:04:21,297 --> 01:04:23,047
Like a jar?

466
01:04:23,424 --> 01:04:25,174
Warm you up.

467
01:04:31,056 --> 01:04:32,974
Anyway...

468
01:04:33,142 --> 01:04:36,853
...rum is not drinking, it's surviving.

469
01:04:39,356 --> 01:04:41,441
You know what's got me stumped?

470
01:04:42,610 --> 01:04:45,528
This is the Havana manifest
right here.

471
01:04:45,696 --> 01:04:48,032
It's clearly signed
by the king's man in Havana...

472
01:04:48,199 --> 01:04:51,160
...the Marquesa Cazaterras,
governor of Cuba.

473
01:04:51,328 --> 01:04:53,495
See, it states here
that entire fleet sunk...

474
01:04:53,663 --> 01:04:55,581
...off the coast of Florida in 1715.

475
01:04:55,749 --> 01:04:58,208
That's King Philip's fleet, 1715.

476
01:04:58,376 --> 01:04:59,960
Every ship, right?

477
01:05:00,128 --> 01:05:03,213
All itemized, all recorded.

478
01:05:03,798 --> 01:05:06,258
So, what I don't understand is...

479
01:05:06,801 --> 01:05:09,470
...what is this ship doing
down here in these waters...

480
01:05:09,638 --> 01:05:13,682
...unitemized, unrecorded,
unescorted...

481
01:05:13,850 --> 01:05:16,310
...and carrying a three-lock box?

482
01:05:23,568 --> 01:05:26,236
He's all right, that David of yours.

483
01:05:28,531 --> 01:05:30,324
I know.

484
01:06:24,797 --> 01:06:26,507
I'm sorry.

485
01:06:29,344 --> 01:06:31,429
I apologise.

486
01:06:33,807 --> 01:06:37,143
I lost touch
why we even came down here.

487
01:06:42,107 --> 01:06:43,983
I'll take you home.

488
01:06:48,864 --> 01:06:51,240
You don't want
to go home tomorrow.

489
01:06:54,953 --> 01:06:57,621
I don't want to
stay here without you.

490
01:07:01,626 --> 01:07:03,669
Say that again.

491
01:07:03,837 --> 01:07:06,714
I don't want to
stay here without you.

492
01:08:23,961 --> 01:08:25,920
Go away, will you?

493
01:08:47,234 --> 01:08:51,946
That was a stupid business last night
and cruel, very cruel.

494
01:08:52,865 --> 01:08:55,324
You did not go to the police.

495
01:08:55,492 --> 01:08:59,453
I've been tossing and turning
all night wondering why.

496
01:09:00,747 --> 01:09:04,625
There's thousands and thousands
of ampoules of morphine down there.

497
01:09:04,793 --> 01:09:07,336
You want them, and I got them.

498
01:09:08,171 --> 01:09:09,672
They're still on the Goliath.

499
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:13,801
You have nothing
but the gall to claim ownership.

500
01:09:15,637 --> 01:09:18,556
I rigged that ship
with booby traps last night.

501
01:09:18,724 --> 01:09:20,391
She's wired to 10 ways to hell...

502
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:23,228
...and the wrong person
goes down there, she'll blow.

503
01:09:25,607 --> 01:09:29,818
You would need an advantage
to deal with me.

504
01:09:33,448 --> 01:09:35,616
I'll expect them in two days.

505
01:09:35,783 --> 01:09:37,576
No, I shall need at least four.

506
01:09:37,744 --> 01:09:41,080
We seem to have settled on three.

507
01:09:44,293 --> 01:09:48,087
What sort of fee are you getting
for diving these days?

508
01:09:48,255 --> 01:09:51,299
One million dollars, cash,
low denominations.

509
01:09:51,467 --> 01:09:55,845
That's my share. You'll make twice
as much as that in America.

510
01:09:58,849 --> 01:10:02,268
Your attitude on drugs
is a matter of record.

511
01:10:02,436 --> 01:10:05,021
Why sell them to me for a profit?

512
01:10:06,357 --> 01:10:07,774
I have my reasons.

513
01:10:10,235 --> 01:10:12,862
Listen, I don't want
any interference in this dive.

514
01:10:13,030 --> 01:10:15,531
I know you'll be watching,
but I don't want to see you.

515
01:10:15,699 --> 01:10:19,160
And as for the young couple,
you keep your hands off of them.

516
01:10:19,328 --> 01:10:23,206
If you want me,
you come and see me this time.

517
01:10:23,374 --> 01:10:25,541
You know where I live.

518
01:10:28,462 --> 01:10:30,838
Three days, Treece.

519
01:10:31,215 --> 01:10:32,924
Three days.

520
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:34,842
Afternoon, Mr. Cloche.

521
01:10:52,069 --> 01:10:53,736
Thank you, Kev.

522
01:10:54,780 --> 01:10:57,407
Now, then. Listen, you two.

523
01:10:57,992 --> 01:10:59,867
When this air gun gets going...

524
01:11:00,035 --> 01:11:03,371
...I want you on my right, David,
and you on my left, girl.

525
01:11:03,539 --> 01:11:07,250
We pick up the ampoules
as the sand gets sucked away...

526
01:11:07,418 --> 01:11:09,293
...but be very careful of your hands.

527
01:11:09,461 --> 01:11:13,382
When this thing's on full,
it can swallow a cannonball.

528
01:11:13,550 --> 01:11:16,093
How much of that junk
are we gonna bring up?

529
01:11:16,594 --> 01:11:20,598
Just enough to satisfy
our audience up there on the cliff.

530
01:11:20,766 --> 01:11:22,934
Oh, they're there, all right.

531
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:29,774
That Kevin sure gives me the willies.

532
01:11:29,942 --> 01:11:32,569
He doesn't say much.

533
01:11:32,737 --> 01:11:34,362
Maybe he don't like you, Adam.

534
01:11:34,530 --> 01:11:37,907
He likes me. He's family.
Don't you worry about Kevin.

535
01:11:38,075 --> 01:11:40,744
You just watch that little lever
on that compressor.

536
01:11:40,911 --> 01:11:44,956
Turn it off if there's any real trouble
and don't forget to turn it on again.

537
01:11:45,124 --> 01:11:48,626
And, boy, you feel that breeze
cutting out of your hose, come up fast.

538
01:11:48,794 --> 01:11:50,628
But be careful. It's just possible...

539
01:11:50,796 --> 01:11:53,256
...there might be somebody
waiting up there for you.

540
01:11:53,424 --> 01:11:55,341
By rights,
it should be me going down.

541
01:11:55,509 --> 01:11:57,552
Now, let's not go into it again, Adam.

542
01:11:57,720 --> 01:12:00,472
I got enough trouble
looking after the boy here.

543
01:12:00,639 --> 01:12:03,641
Don't worry, Treece.
I'm gonna go slow enough for you.

544
01:12:09,774 --> 01:12:12,817
- I'm going in.
- Okay.

545
01:12:50,314 --> 01:12:52,107
Gail's behind us.

546
01:12:52,274 --> 01:12:53,525
Get closer.

547
01:12:53,692 --> 01:12:55,610
I can't hear you.

548
01:12:55,779 --> 01:12:57,613
You'll have to shout.

549
01:13:30,273 --> 01:13:31,606
Right, David.

550
01:13:31,774 --> 01:13:34,067
Now, keep those air hoses clear.

551
01:13:34,235 --> 01:13:35,652
Right.

552
01:13:39,866 --> 01:13:42,325
You go down.
I'll be right behind you.

553
01:15:17,173 --> 01:15:19,049
Wait, wait.

554
01:15:21,386 --> 01:15:24,179
That's where we saw the eel.

555
01:15:46,536 --> 01:15:48,495
Come on.

556
01:16:13,605 --> 01:16:15,148
David.

557
01:16:15,316 --> 01:16:18,860
Lead it into the next compartment.

558
01:16:43,552 --> 01:16:46,387
Keep your hands clear, girl.

559
01:18:02,216 --> 01:18:10,181
Let's go look for the treasure.

560
01:18:10,683 --> 01:18:13,017
All right.

561
01:18:23,487 --> 01:18:25,447
Goliath's moving.

562
01:20:17,228 --> 01:20:19,104
Kevin!

563
01:20:45,007 --> 01:20:48,759
- David.
- Girl, you wait. I'll go.

564
01:21:43,733 --> 01:21:46,151
- Are you all right?
- I'm okay.

565
01:21:46,319 --> 01:21:48,445
Look what I found.
Look what I found.

566
01:21:48,613 --> 01:21:51,990
I don't care what you found. That was
a bloody amateur thing to do.

567
01:21:52,158 --> 01:21:54,743
I had to take the mask off.
I couldn't reach it.

568
01:21:54,911 --> 01:21:57,162
Damn it. Look at it.

569
01:21:59,540 --> 01:22:01,833
Gail, look. It's gold.

570
01:22:03,169 --> 01:22:05,921
I knew there was treasure
down here.

571
01:22:33,617 --> 01:22:36,285
What kind of a ship was it?

572
01:22:36,453 --> 01:22:38,413
Probably Spanish.

573
01:22:38,580 --> 01:22:40,540
Might be a galleon.

574
01:22:40,708 --> 01:22:43,335
Till you fell through the Goliath...

575
01:22:43,503 --> 01:22:46,130
...this cave was all sealed up.

576
01:22:46,297 --> 01:22:48,215
That tunnel I pulled you out of...

577
01:22:49,592 --> 01:22:52,052
...it leads right down
to the bottom of the reef.

578
01:23:04,983 --> 01:23:06,817
Let's get out of here.

579
01:23:06,985 --> 01:23:10,612
Goliath's on the move again.
It'll cut our hoses.

580
01:23:10,780 --> 01:23:14,032
Up, now. Up, up.

581
01:23:23,668 --> 01:23:26,295
- How many you reckon we have?
- About 4000.

582
01:23:26,463 --> 01:23:28,338
Here you go, Kev.

583
01:23:30,258 --> 01:23:33,177
Explosives?
What the hell are you doing that for?

584
01:23:33,344 --> 01:23:36,054
- I'm rigging this.
- What the hell for?

585
01:23:36,222 --> 01:23:39,016
Because this is the first place
anybody would look for them.

586
01:23:39,184 --> 01:23:43,187
If you hide the things somewhere else,
you wouldn't have to blow your house.

587
01:23:43,354 --> 01:23:45,355
But if I hide the things
somewhere else...

588
01:23:45,523 --> 01:23:48,025
...they wouldn't know where to look,
would they?

589
01:23:50,403 --> 01:23:52,696
I'm only gonna keep
the buggers two days.

590
01:23:58,369 --> 01:24:01,413
Kev, you stay ashore from now on.

591
01:24:01,581 --> 01:24:04,208
Somebody's got to watch this place.

592
01:24:04,375 --> 01:24:05,834
Right.

593
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:11,673
Oh, the hell. It still makes no sense.

594
01:24:13,218 --> 01:24:14,843
What?

595
01:24:17,515 --> 01:24:19,892
We know that the Grifon
is the wreck underneath.

596
01:24:20,060 --> 01:24:23,062
- We know that from the bell, right?
- Right.

597
01:24:24,815 --> 01:24:27,107
But you see,
it says here in the manifest...

598
01:24:27,275 --> 01:24:29,944
...the Grifon was a French ship
with a French captain...

599
01:24:30,111 --> 01:24:31,320
...a tobacco ship.

600
01:24:31,488 --> 01:24:33,906
It's allowed to tag along
with the 1715 fleet...

601
01:24:34,074 --> 01:24:37,493
...for protection from pirates.
That's here in the manifest.

602
01:24:38,662 --> 01:24:40,746
You know what interests me?

603
01:24:40,914 --> 01:24:43,582
The Grifon was the only ship
to survive that hurricane.

604
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:45,584
She went back to Havana
for repairs.

605
01:24:45,752 --> 01:24:48,587
All right, but then what's she doing
off of Bermuda...

606
01:24:48,755 --> 01:24:51,423
...with part of that fleet's treasure?
- I don't know.

607
01:24:51,591 --> 01:24:53,592
That's what I keep trying to puzzle out.

608
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:57,304
Because it says here
the entire 1715 fleet...

609
01:24:57,472 --> 01:25:00,057
...went down off Florida together,
all 11 ships.

610
01:25:00,225 --> 01:25:03,352
They say the fleet's treasure
was aboard the flagship.

611
01:25:05,105 --> 01:25:07,606
The sailing manifests prove it.

612
01:25:08,483 --> 01:25:11,318
Then the governor, Cazaterras,
the man I told you about...

613
01:25:11,486 --> 01:25:13,445
...he reports everything's lost.

614
01:25:15,782 --> 01:25:17,950
- Maybe he's wrong.
- No.

615
01:25:18,118 --> 01:25:19,952
See, what we found is jewellery.

616
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:22,788
We didn't find the gold
and silver from the fleet.

617
01:25:22,956 --> 01:25:27,293
Jewellery and a Spanish three-lock box
on a French tagalong tobacco ship.

618
01:25:27,460 --> 01:25:30,421
Well, somebody could be lying.
Could be lying.

619
01:25:30,589 --> 01:25:33,299
No, the Spaniards were fanatics
for accurate records.

620
01:25:34,009 --> 01:25:37,928
They always had everything like this
rechecked by some important official.

621
01:25:38,096 --> 01:25:39,430
Here it is again.

622
01:25:39,598 --> 01:25:41,265
What?

623
01:25:41,975 --> 01:25:43,726
"E.F."

624
01:25:51,484 --> 01:25:52,735
Look at that.

625
01:25:54,821 --> 01:25:57,324
What's something like that worth?

626
01:25:57,950 --> 01:25:59,951
I don't know exactly
what you got there.

627
01:26:00,119 --> 01:26:02,162
Eight or nine ounces,
22-carat gold.

628
01:26:02,330 --> 01:26:04,789
Good pearls.

629
01:26:04,957 --> 01:26:08,543
Play it quiet,
maybe $7500 on the market...

630
01:26:08,712 --> 01:26:10,838
...less breakdown and melting costs.

631
01:26:11,006 --> 01:26:13,257
You wouldn't melt
a beautiful thing like that?

632
01:26:13,425 --> 01:26:16,177
No, I wouldn't,
but there are those who would.

633
01:26:16,345 --> 01:26:18,179
And the ocean's not a jewellery store.

634
01:26:18,347 --> 01:26:20,014
You don't get no receipts.

635
01:26:20,182 --> 01:26:22,016
You got to prove
that that's authentic.

636
01:26:22,184 --> 01:26:24,936
- Anybody can see it's authentic.
- You don't understand me.

637
01:26:25,103 --> 01:26:27,438
There's a lot of counterfeit
on the market today.

638
01:26:27,606 --> 01:26:30,691
I mean, it's real gold, it's real gems,
but it's false.

639
01:26:31,818 --> 01:26:34,278
No, you have to establish
a provenance.

640
01:26:34,446 --> 01:26:37,615
You gotta do that first.
You gotta find a proof that it's real.

641
01:26:38,533 --> 01:26:40,993
Now, if we could find in here
a verifying record...

642
01:26:41,161 --> 01:26:43,204
...a description of any piece
down there...

643
01:26:43,372 --> 01:26:46,165
...that makes it all worth
a bloody fortune.

644
01:26:47,960 --> 01:26:50,294
Want to have your name
on a plaque?

645
01:26:50,462 --> 01:26:51,671
Want to be a celebrity?

646
01:26:52,756 --> 01:26:55,675
No, there's not enough room
in the Hamilton library.

647
01:26:55,842 --> 01:26:58,886
I think they could find
a bit of room for you, boy.

648
01:26:59,054 --> 01:27:01,973
Well, it's possible,
it's just possible...

649
01:27:02,140 --> 01:27:06,227
...there's something else going on,
but I don't know what it is.

650
01:27:10,857 --> 01:27:13,901
Beat it out of me if you want to,
but it won't do you any good.

651
01:27:14,069 --> 01:27:16,988
I merely need information.

652
01:27:20,033 --> 01:27:23,619
Which brings us, of course,
to your fee.

653
01:27:24,663 --> 01:27:27,331
How much is Treece paying you,
by the way?

654
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:32,044
I'll pay 10 percent.

655
01:27:36,592 --> 01:27:37,926
Done.

656
01:27:45,601 --> 01:27:47,853
How many did they bring up today?

657
01:27:49,063 --> 01:27:53,233
Six. Four thousand or so.

658
01:27:53,443 --> 01:27:55,861
And yet Treece claims
they're all down there?

659
01:27:56,029 --> 01:27:58,739
That's what the girl says, yes.

660
01:28:00,616 --> 01:28:05,329
It almost seems as if Treece
is hiding something from both of us.

661
01:28:06,415 --> 01:28:08,416
Doesn't it, my friend?

662
01:28:14,423 --> 01:28:16,799
And we can't have partners
who double-cross us...

663
01:28:16,967 --> 01:28:18,426
...can we?

664
01:28:21,555 --> 01:28:23,181
David?

665
01:28:24,349 --> 01:28:26,768
You know, maybe you were right.

666
01:28:28,896 --> 01:28:32,398
You know, I think somebody was lying
and do you know who I think it is?

667
01:28:33,025 --> 01:28:35,068
Governor of Havana.

668
01:28:35,402 --> 01:28:37,570
Come here. Have a look at this.

669
01:28:40,866 --> 01:28:43,117
See, this is the list
he sent back to Spain...

670
01:28:43,285 --> 01:28:45,912
...reporting the goods
that were lost in the storm.

671
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:48,206
But according to this list...

672
01:28:48,373 --> 01:28:52,376
...more was lost than the fleet's
sailing manifest said was sent.

673
01:28:53,837 --> 01:28:57,090
You know the difference?
The difference is jewels.

674
01:28:57,508 --> 01:29:01,677
Not trinkets, mind you.
Masterpieces, works of art.

675
01:29:02,763 --> 01:29:05,515
Two pages of the list were lost.
They never got to Seville.

676
01:29:05,682 --> 01:29:07,517
That's where the original is.

677
01:29:08,852 --> 01:29:10,728
You listen.

678
01:29:11,647 --> 01:29:14,858
"A team of silver horses
pulling a golden carriage.

679
01:29:15,985 --> 01:29:17,486
A pair ofjade hummingbirds...

680
01:29:17,654 --> 01:29:21,865
...one with wings of emeralds,
the other with wings of pearl.

681
01:29:22,367 --> 01:29:24,201
A golden dragon with emerald eyes."

682
01:29:24,369 --> 01:29:26,870
Yeah, but does it say anything
about what we found?

683
01:29:27,038 --> 01:29:29,373
Like the pine cone
filled with pearls...

684
01:29:29,541 --> 01:29:31,291
...or the medallion itself?

685
01:29:31,459 --> 01:29:34,253
No. Not on that page.

686
01:29:34,796 --> 01:29:36,130
You know something?

687
01:29:36,297 --> 01:29:39,216
This doesn't even look like
a proper manifest to me.

688
01:29:39,384 --> 01:29:41,969
It's not a manifest.
It's a shopping list.

689
01:29:42,137 --> 01:29:44,304
- For a woman.
- For what?

690
01:29:44,472 --> 01:29:47,141
It's a shopping list for a woman.

691
01:29:47,559 --> 01:29:50,519
Gentlemen, I give you E.F.

692
01:29:54,024 --> 01:29:56,693
- It's the lady on the medallion.
- The Duchess of Parma.

693
01:29:56,861 --> 01:30:00,071
Oh, come on, Gail.
We've got an E.F., not a D.P.

694
01:30:00,239 --> 01:30:02,073
The Duchess of Parma was her title.

695
01:30:02,241 --> 01:30:04,325
Elizabeth Farnese
was her real name.

696
01:30:04,493 --> 01:30:08,413
- Come on, girl. Get on with it.
- Well, it seems that in 1714...

697
01:30:08,581 --> 01:30:11,207
...when King Philip's first wife
had just died...

698
01:30:11,375 --> 01:30:14,294
...he developed a royal lust...

699
01:30:14,461 --> 01:30:16,337
...for the beautiful
Duchess of Parma.

700
01:30:16,505 --> 01:30:19,382
Well, she finally agreed to marry him,
by proxy...

701
01:30:19,550 --> 01:30:22,969
...but he wasn't there yet because
Elizabeth wasn't the kind of woman...

702
01:30:23,137 --> 01:30:26,014
...to give away something for nothing,
like her virginity.

703
01:30:26,182 --> 01:30:27,974
And before he could touch that...

704
01:30:28,142 --> 01:30:33,104
...she insisted that he deck her up
with a set of jewels, quote...

705
01:30:33,272 --> 01:30:35,398
..."unique in all the world," unquote.

706
01:30:35,566 --> 01:30:38,318
Now, Philip commissioned
those jewels to be made...

707
01:30:38,485 --> 01:30:41,446
...and if that's what we found,
he never got laid.

708
01:30:42,364 --> 01:30:44,282
Beautiful. Just beautiful.

709
01:30:44,450 --> 01:30:47,243
Yeah, she was a pretty smart lady.

710
01:30:47,411 --> 01:30:49,747
You know, I've known him
for three years...

711
01:30:49,915 --> 01:30:53,584
...and all he's ever given me
is a sweater and a pair of sneakers.

712
01:30:55,086 --> 01:30:57,713
Well, he isn't the king of Spain,
is he, girl?

713
01:30:57,881 --> 01:30:59,673
What do you think?

714
01:31:01,927 --> 01:31:03,677
Well...

715
01:31:05,138 --> 01:31:07,223
Thinking aloud...

716
01:31:07,724 --> 01:31:10,226
Just suppose you were
the governor of Havana...

717
01:31:10,393 --> 01:31:12,144
...with a three-lock box...

718
01:31:12,312 --> 01:31:14,480
...and you knew it had something
so personal...

719
01:31:14,648 --> 01:31:16,941
...so valuable,
belonging to the king of Spain.

720
01:31:18,485 --> 01:31:22,613
You might not put it on a prime target
like a flagship.

721
01:31:22,781 --> 01:31:25,157
You might just put it
on a French tobacco ship.

722
01:31:25,951 --> 01:31:28,285
You know the fleet
would be there for protection...

723
01:31:28,453 --> 01:31:31,622
...but then the whole fleet sinks
except the French tobacco ship...

724
01:31:31,790 --> 01:31:34,166
...and the governor
keeps to his story...

725
01:31:34,334 --> 01:31:37,836
...and he lists the box as lost
along with the fleet.

726
01:31:38,004 --> 01:31:39,630
I'll buy it.

727
01:31:39,798 --> 01:31:41,131
The Grifon sails again...

728
01:31:41,299 --> 01:31:44,510
...and this time it gets caught
in another hurricane off Bermuda...

729
01:31:44,678 --> 01:31:46,179
...and it sinks.

730
01:31:46,347 --> 01:31:48,014
The poor old governor of Havana...

731
01:31:48,182 --> 01:31:51,351
...he has to go back to Madrid
and live on his pension, right?

732
01:31:53,896 --> 01:31:57,941
You know, girl, if we could just find
one item down there...

733
01:31:58,109 --> 01:32:00,819
...just one
that's on your shopping list...

734
01:32:00,987 --> 01:32:03,697
...we've found
our bloody provenance.

735
01:33:18,398 --> 01:33:21,442
That's why he wouldn't let me dive.

736
01:33:24,071 --> 01:33:26,655
Damn you, Treece.

737
01:34:02,151 --> 01:34:03,443
David?

738
01:34:15,290 --> 01:34:17,667
"E.F." It's E.F. Again.

739
01:34:17,835 --> 01:34:19,961
Treece. Treece.

740
01:36:24,588 --> 01:36:26,589
Up. Up. Everybody, up.

741
01:36:32,221 --> 01:36:34,138
The both of you, up.

742
01:36:34,306 --> 01:36:35,682
Let me get this first.

743
01:36:35,849 --> 01:36:38,434
- Get up.
- Let me get this first.

744
01:36:38,602 --> 01:36:40,937
I don't care
what you've found, boy.

745
01:37:17,808 --> 01:37:21,021
Wait, get the dredge.

746
01:38:42,395 --> 01:38:48,274
David, our only chance
is to go up in the bubbles.

747
01:38:48,442 --> 01:38:50,443
Take all the breath you can.

748
01:38:50,611 --> 01:38:53,113
I'm gonna cut the air hoses,
so stay close.

749
01:39:41,831 --> 01:39:44,291
What the hell happened up here?

750
01:39:44,459 --> 01:39:46,460
Old Fellini came by in his boat.

751
01:39:46,627 --> 01:39:49,004
He was all rummed up.
God help me.

752
01:39:49,172 --> 01:39:50,839
I must have been dozing
or something.

753
01:39:51,007 --> 01:39:53,341
When I looked out,
all that stuff in the water...

754
01:39:53,509 --> 01:39:55,051
...and the sharks were all over.

755
01:39:55,219 --> 01:39:57,220
Why didn't you warn us
on that compressor?

756
01:39:57,388 --> 01:39:59,014
I was gonna turn it on, I was.

757
01:39:59,182 --> 01:40:02,893
But then I knew you wouldn't know
what kind of trouble you was in...

758
01:40:03,060 --> 01:40:06,563
...and I might send you
right into them.

759
01:40:06,731 --> 01:40:09,357
Thank God you came through.

760
01:40:17,909 --> 01:40:21,036
I knew there was more than morphine
down there...

761
01:40:22,455 --> 01:40:26,333
...all those ampoules
coming up so slow like they were.

762
01:40:26,501 --> 01:40:28,585
Yes. That's right, Adam.

763
01:40:28,920 --> 01:40:32,380
I might just have saved your life
for something after all.

764
01:40:33,090 --> 01:40:35,802
Hey, boy. Get that dredge up.

765
01:40:35,969 --> 01:40:39,472
There'll be no more diving today,
not with all those sharks around.

766
01:40:43,560 --> 01:40:46,896
All right, once again.
One more time, just for the hell of it.

767
01:40:47,064 --> 01:40:49,565
Oh, I'm too tired.

768
01:40:49,733 --> 01:40:53,194
Let's face it.
We haven't got our provenance.

769
01:40:53,362 --> 01:40:56,030
All the jewellery we found
must be on those missing pages.

770
01:40:56,198 --> 01:40:59,742
Well, let's go over it again
just one more time for the hell of it.

771
01:40:59,910 --> 01:41:02,620
All right, and give me a rum,
would you?

772
01:41:04,039 --> 01:41:07,000
One golden ruby-studded cross.

773
01:41:21,808 --> 01:41:23,433
Good morning.

774
01:41:36,781 --> 01:41:38,532
Kevin.

775
01:41:57,427 --> 01:42:00,053
Four tanks. They need filling.

776
01:42:00,305 --> 01:42:02,973
Treece is expecting me.
They all up there?

777
01:42:03,141 --> 01:42:04,975
Aye, they're there.

778
01:44:06,767 --> 01:44:07,934
Gail, let me see the...

779
01:44:08,102 --> 01:44:10,395
Let me see your sketch
of the Grifon.

780
01:44:10,563 --> 01:44:12,230
It's in my bag.

781
01:44:15,443 --> 01:44:18,862
- Is there any fresh coffee, David?
- Yeah, it's on the table.

782
01:44:20,698 --> 01:44:24,784
Wait a minute, this is the medallion.
I want the original one, the Goliath.

783
01:44:24,952 --> 01:44:27,495
- It's in there too.
- No, it's not in here at all.

784
01:44:27,663 --> 01:44:30,081
- It must be.
- Well, you come look.

785
01:44:39,675 --> 01:44:41,509
You're right. It's not.

786
01:44:43,262 --> 01:44:44,596
Adam.

787
01:44:46,515 --> 01:44:49,310
I think I'll take a breath of air.

788
01:44:50,479 --> 01:44:53,647
Do you mind locking up after me?

789
01:45:03,408 --> 01:45:05,076
Thank you.

790
01:46:01,217 --> 01:46:03,301
Jesus. That's it. That is it.

791
01:46:03,469 --> 01:46:05,512
- What?
- I've seen this.

792
01:46:05,680 --> 01:46:08,348
I've seen part of this.
I've seen part of this down there.

793
01:46:08,516 --> 01:46:10,392
- Seen what?
- Well...

794
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:12,644
See, she's wearing
a dragon pendant...

795
01:46:12,812 --> 01:46:16,398
...but when you drew this, these lines,
I thought that was her dress...

796
01:46:16,566 --> 01:46:19,234
...but you drew this before Treece
cleaned the medallion.

797
01:46:19,402 --> 01:46:22,404
Now, I've seen this chain.
I've seen this chain down there.

798
01:46:22,572 --> 01:46:24,114
I was trying to get it.

799
01:46:24,282 --> 01:46:26,741
On the list, there's something about
gold chains...

800
01:46:26,909 --> 01:46:29,870
...chains of gold.
Something like that.

801
01:46:37,670 --> 01:46:41,465
- Nope, there's nothing about chains.
- Yes. Yes, there is.

802
01:46:42,259 --> 01:46:44,927
There is a dragon pendant.
"A gold-jewelled dragon."

803
01:46:45,095 --> 01:46:46,262
That's it. That's it.

804
01:46:46,430 --> 01:46:49,849
Then the jeweller that made this
pendant also made this medallion.

805
01:46:50,017 --> 01:46:52,268
Now, if I go down there
and I find the chain...

806
01:46:52,436 --> 01:46:54,896
...and the dragon
is at the end of the chain...

807
01:46:55,189 --> 01:46:58,941
...then we've got our proof, babe.
We got our proof, huh? All right.

808
01:47:05,282 --> 01:47:06,867
Kev?

809
01:48:13,851 --> 01:48:17,187
Treece, we solved it.
It was here all along.

810
01:48:17,355 --> 01:48:20,357
It's the provenance.
David's seen part of it down there.

811
01:48:20,525 --> 01:48:23,735
- You solved nothing.
- What the hell you talking about?

812
01:48:23,903 --> 01:48:26,530
I'm going to blow the Goliath now.

813
01:48:27,115 --> 01:48:28,782
Why now?

814
01:48:30,535 --> 01:48:33,288
Because if anything
happens to me...

815
01:48:33,956 --> 01:48:36,499
...there's nobody else left to do it.

816
01:48:44,551 --> 01:48:47,219
What do you mean,
if anything happens to you?

817
01:48:52,267 --> 01:48:55,811
You go ahead and blow the Goliath,
Treece. You go ahead and blow it.

818
01:48:55,979 --> 01:48:58,939
But first, I'm going down there.
I'm getting that provenance.

819
01:49:01,234 --> 01:49:04,361
Go upstairs, pack, and go home.

820
01:49:04,529 --> 01:49:07,823
To hell with it, Treece.
I'm not doing that.

821
01:49:07,991 --> 01:49:09,408
I'm going down there...

822
01:49:09,576 --> 01:49:12,077
...and you're gonna
have to blow me up too.

823
01:49:13,705 --> 01:49:15,956
As you please, boy.

824
01:49:17,792 --> 01:49:19,543
Excuse me.

825
01:49:26,134 --> 01:49:28,469
You don't need me down there,
do you?

826
01:49:28,636 --> 01:49:31,055
No, I don't think I do.

827
01:50:37,582 --> 01:50:39,500
Coffin.

828
01:50:39,918 --> 01:50:41,919
They killed Kevin.

829
01:51:01,648 --> 01:51:05,568
David, I'm gonna signal you
when I fire this fuse.

830
01:51:05,735 --> 01:51:09,530
After that, I don't care if you've found
the Holy Grail itself.

831
01:51:09,698 --> 01:51:12,867
You've only got three minutes,
so get out.

832
01:51:19,583 --> 01:51:21,876
Listen. Now, don't worry.

833
01:51:22,043 --> 01:51:24,712
Just turn on the air dredge
when I get in, all right?

834
01:51:24,880 --> 01:51:27,339
I'll be all right, huh?

835
02:01:37,170 --> 02:01:38,670
David.

836
02:02:33,060 --> 02:02:35,520
David! Here!
