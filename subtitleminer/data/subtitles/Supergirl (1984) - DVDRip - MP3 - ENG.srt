00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,272
Hello to you.
I hope you're fine.

2
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,111
Who knows
the electron wave functions...

3
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,319
- ... for Kryptonian convalent bonding?
- Sorry.

4
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,952
- Leah.
- The cube root of the wavelength...

5
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,029
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

6
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,512
- Hello, Kara.
- Hello to you.

7
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,873
Oh, it is beautiful.

8
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,879
What's that gonna be, Zaltar?

9
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,231
I think, a tree.

10
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,477
A tree.

11
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,036
- What is a tree?
- A lovely thing which grows on Earth.

12
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,430
Earth?
You mean, where my cousin went?

13
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:57,758
And to where, one day soon
perhaps, I might venture as well.

14
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,470
I don't believe you. How?

15
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,478
In that. Through there.

16
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,478
The binary chute? But you
could never survive the pressure.

17
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,758
- In that, I can. Zip-zap and I'm gone.
- But you'd never leave us, Zaltar.

18
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,394
- You'd never leave Argo city.
- Indeed I might, Kara.

19
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,192
Too much of a good thing here.

20
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,718
Perhaps I'll try Saturn instead.
Yes, I think I might.

21
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,071
Saturn, is-
Is that further away than Earth?

22
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,477
Silly question. Did you not study
six-dimensional geometry at school?

23
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,871
- Do they not teach anything anymore?
- Well, of course they do.

24
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,310
I know the equations.

25
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,078
I just can't see them in my head.

26
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,193
Most great artists find
mathematics troublesome, Kara.

27
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,914
Only use your imagination.

28
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:49,992
Saturn and Earth are in outer space.
But we- We are in inner space.

29
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,990
Our city has two great power sources.
This is one of them. Look.

30
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,874
An omegahedron.

31
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,148
- The Guardians let you have it?
- Not exactly. I borrowed it.

32
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:14,879
- You stole it. Zaltar, they're gonna tell-
- No. Borrowed it for the afternoon.

33
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,873
- For inspiration.
- Inspiration.

34
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,394
But I think that I shall never see
the branches of a living tree.

35
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,990
Why? An omegahedron
can create life, can't it?

36
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,795
It can't, child, it can't.
Just the illusion of life.

37
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,150
That's a fancy shadow
of the real thing...

38
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,999
...which is the most we can hope for
on this lonely old rock.

39
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,918
Kara.

40
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,512
- Kara, I've been looking for you for ages.
- I'm sorry, Mother.

41
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,756
- Zaltar?
- Alura, join us.

42
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,157
We're just inventing miracles.

43
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:12,037
Put your fingers here, Kara,
and press hard.

44
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,799
Good. Now try it.

45
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,151
Let your imagination explode
and give it a try. Go on.

46
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:25,549
Zaltar, my husband tells me you talk
of leaving Argo City. For where?

47
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,149
Parts unknown. It is a law, it's a fact.

48
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,591
You and Zor-El have a life here.
You have each other and you have Kara.

49
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,156
But, Zaltar, you founded this city.
It's yours.

50
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:39,677
As far as the eye can see
right to the veil, smack. And then what?

51
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,233
What is beyond?

52
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,877
Alura, I cannot contain myself to Argo
City only. My head is boiling with ideas.

53
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,998
My imagination is too vast,
it's uncontrollable.

54
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,998
If you want my opinion, Zaltar,
you're starting to repeat yourself...

55
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,630
...with all this airy, glittery stuff.

56
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,435
Exactly. That's why
I'm going to Venus.

57
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,515
Venus? When?

58
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,109
Tomorrow or the next day,
at the latest.

59
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,754
Zaltar, have you thought about this?
It doesn't make sense to me.

60
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:14,556
I have thought intensely.
My mind is made up.

61
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,278
Kara! The power source!

62
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,715
Oh, Zaltar!
Save me. Please! Help!

63
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,995
No!

64
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,237
- Kara!
- Zaltar!

65
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,437
Help! No!

66
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,668
Calm down.

67
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,914
You took the omegahedron.

68
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,514
That's not correct.
I lost the omegahedron.

69
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,473
- Oh, no, Father, I did. I was-
- No matter who.

70
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,240
Without it this city can't survive
more than a few days.

71
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,517
Our lights will grow dim
and the very air we breathe, so thin.

72
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:46,918
I know. So I shall find it. I shall go right
to the end of inner space and return it.

73
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,957
Impossible. How?

74
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,475
No one can leave
Argo City and you know it.

75
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,389
This is our universe, and you destroyed it
with a game. A childish game.

76
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,830
I think it can be done.

77
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:02,113
Through there, the binary chute.
In the traveler.

78
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,272
Like a coward. You choose
instant destruction...

79
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,274
...while the rest of us are doomed
to stay here in our beloved city...

80
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,719
Kara!

81
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,115
Kara, no!

82
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,075
- You lunatic.
- She'll be killed.

83
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,679
Oh, no, she won't.

84
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:59,193
She will be safe through the binary,
through the warp, into another register.

85
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,960
- Another what?
- Gravitational radiation.

86
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,510
A pathway from inner space
to outer space.

87
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,314
Then she'll never be the same, ever.

88
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,636
At least she'll be alive.

89
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:16,268
And my fate is sealed.
I've lost the omegahedron.

90
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,550
I must be sent to the Phantom Zone.

91
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,877
Your suffering will be short.
Mine...

92
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,752
...forever.

93
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,752
Some more champagne,
my dear Selena?

94
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,911
What are you thinking about?

95
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,913
Such a pretty world.

96
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,192
I can't wait until it's all mine.

97
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:47,036
The only way you can rule the world
is to become invisible, my pumpkin.

98
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,232
Invisible?

99
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,680
You'd almost know
how to make me invisible.

100
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,074
Oh, I do know.

101
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,158
Take five black beans
and the head of a dead man.

102
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,477
Place one bean in his mouth,
two beans in his eyes, then-

103
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,710
Nigel, enough.

104
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,356
But it works. Then you can
get anywhere, do anything.

105
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,751
Nigel, how long have we been together?

106
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,434
Months, darling.

107
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,474
Then why does it seem like years?

108
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,753
Because you're so impatient.
You want everything yesterday.

109
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:25,478
It's a lifetime to discover the secrets of
black magic from the ancient grimoires.

110
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,990
Holy cow.

111
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,674
I wonder...

112
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:08,078
Immortality be upon this one

113
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:13,116
She is a sharer
Of the sun's everlasting life

114
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,835
There will now be no danger
Of death

115
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:22,194
This world will keep her forever

116
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,715
What is it? What's going on?
Hey, what's going on?

117
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,559
I've just outgrown you, Nigel.

118
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,472
These things happen.

119
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,830
You can't treat me like this, Selena.

120
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:38,477
Without me, you'd still be
reading tea leaves at Lake Tahoe.

121
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:47,111
- Amsterdam and more. That's TWA.
Never has flying been easier.

122
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,874
You can't run out on me, Selena.

123
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,513
I've got the keys, sweetheart.

124
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,513
The president confirmed reports
that Superman has embarked...

125
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,114
...on a special peace-seeking
mission to a galaxy...

126
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:02,478
...scientists estimate may be
several hundred billion light-years away.

127
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,317
Bianca!

128
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,511
I'm home.

129
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,355
- Bianca!
- What?

130
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,871
Show your face.

131
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:05,078
I have a surprise for you.

132
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,797
They've turned off the hot water again.

133
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,475
I'm really gonna have to kill somebody
down at the DWP.

134
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,791
I figure the only way that we're gonna
pay our bills next month in this dump...

135
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,032
...is to just go ahead and do what I said,
which is to start our own coven.

136
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,151
No longer necessary.

137
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,631
I was reading in this book, you know,
The Witches Guide To Heaven and Hell.

138
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,319
And if you start your own coven...

139
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,796
...all you have to do is charge five bucks
a head minimal admission. That's great.

140
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,996
- Chicken feed.
- That's better than goose egg.

141
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,071
What's in the Coffer of Shadow there?

142
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,317
- Where's little Nigel?
- Nigel, my dear Bianca, is history.

143
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,909
- Oh, yeah? How so?
- The water department is history.

144
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,595
The car payments are history.
The mortgage payments are history.

145
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,109
- How are the property taxes?
- History.

146
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,711
The world is at last my oyster.

147
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,992
Now this I like.

148
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:59,318
- Hello.
- Hello, she says.

149
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:02,199
- Well, hello to you, honeybun.
- Hello.

150
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,675
I was wondering if you could
tell me where I am.

151
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,031
What do they call this place, Eddie?
Lovers' Lane, isn't it?

152
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,232
You got it in one, Billy boy.
Lovers' Lane.

153
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:16,314
You see, what I meant was, is- Those
lights over there. What are they called?

154
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:20,354
Check out the view
from back here, Eduardo.

155
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,717
Stop that.

156
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,958
You're Superman's best friend, huh?

157
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:31,070
No. His cousin. I've come here
to search for the omegahedron.

158
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,750
It's a power source vital to Argo City.
You see, that's where I live.

159
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,871
No kidding.

160
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,558
Eddie and me here,
we're on a secret mission also.

161
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,876
We're out looking for a good time.

162
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,630
And you just won the brass ring, baby.

163
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,591
Oh, she works out, huh?

164
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,199
Why are you doing this?

165
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,756
It's just the way we are.

166
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,390
You shouldn't have done that, baby.

167
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,029
Come on.

168
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,314
Oh, I see.

169
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,677
You really wanna play games,
eh, sweetheart?

170
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,111
Come on. Come-

171
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,278
Eddie.

172
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:55,439
I think maybe we should kind of keep
this to ourselves. What do you think?

173
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,715
How are you?

174
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,235
Time you listen, everybody.

175
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,072
Who said that?
But there is no-

176
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,919
Try telling your wife. I need another.

177
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,316
Where is it?
Where's the little mystery ball?

178
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,630
Just let me have a peek.
Maybe I can shed some light.

179
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,951
- I hate light.
- Is it electrical? Is it hot to the touch?

180
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,475
- Where is it?
- Safe and sound.

181
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,029
Go mix. Leave me to my thoughts.

182
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,715
Go mix? With these people?
You must be mad. Who are they?

183
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,708
- Wrinkly little wretches.
- These are my foot soldiers, Nigel.

184
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,831
My army of the night.

185
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:44,797
I'm considering nothing
less than world domination.

186
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,513
After you left me in the lurch...

187
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,591
...I saw something
that should worry you greatly...

188
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:51,513
...if you're serious
about taking over this planet.

189
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:56,151
My secret was blue and red
and it knew how to fly.

190
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,351
I've a secret too, Nigel.

191
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:03,236
I have the power.
Now, get that through your head.

192
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:08,799
- Oh, I bet they're in for it now, eh?
- Count on it.

193
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,317
I have in my time seen a great number
of things even more impressive...

194
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:20,313
...than a human cigarette lighter,
dear lady.

195
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,557
To wit:

196
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,152
What is that?

197
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:33,316
Overreaching ambition.
Take heed.

198
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,798
Touched a little nerve, didn't I?

199
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,788
- Hello.
- Hello.

200
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:46,272
The red toad that lurks in the briars
and brambles is full of sorceries.

201
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,040
- There's a little bone on the left side.
- A little bone.

202
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,637
A little bone, which if bound
to a man stirs up the greatest lust.

203
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:57,196
- I wanna be rich and famous.
- Then stick with me.

204
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,309
I was put on this earth
to thrill millions.

205
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,235
This is scrumptious.

206
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:08,194
Why don't we go somewhere else
and dance cheek to cheek.

207
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,669
Stop it, Selena. That's not fair.

208
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,598
Pick on me.

209
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,152
- Thanks.
- Hey, no sweat.

210
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,039
- What happened?
- Oh, nothing much.

211
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,118
Get out of my house, Nigel.

212
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,118
And don't come slithering back.

213
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:44,269
I'm warning you, Selena.
Don't be so shortsighted.

214
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,311
Good morning.

215
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,153
Have you got it, Lucy?
It must be near that oak tree.

216
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,117
- Hurry up.
- Found it, guys.

217
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:17,592
What are you doing in there?
You're supposed to find the ball.

218
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:23,238
Come on, don't take all day.
You're holding up the game.

219
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,149
- Hey, it's your turn.
- Let's go. Let's go.

220
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,873
Okay. Okay. Let's play ball.

221
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,951
All right, batter.

222
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,631
I couldn't make it.
I have to finish my...

223
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,238
Hey, toss the ball back, will you?

224
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,317
Come on, make it two in a row.

225
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,191
- Where have you been?
- With the principal.

226
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,952
Danvers was doing his usual number.

227
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,639
Jeez, another barfy new student.

228
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,872
They're really scraping
the bottom of the barrel these days.

229
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,595
Hang in there, Danvers.
Don't let them get to you.

230
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,875
Thirty days. The semester's just started.
And here we-

231
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,753
- Hello. I-
- Didn't knock.

232
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,077
Don't we teach you manners
around here?

233
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,271
Don't we try to impress on
all our young ladies...

234
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,233
...that animals in the jungle
never knock, but Midvale girls always do.

235
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,391
Where are you going?
Come back here.

236
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,675
Come in.

237
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:15,636
- I forgot. I'm not just used to the-
- Wait a minute.

238
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,792
Wait just one second.

239
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,278
I have never before in my life
laid eyes on you. Have I, young lady?

240
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,595
No, sir. I'm new here.

241
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,752
New here? Obviously you're new here
if I've never laid eyes on you before.

242
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:31,390
The question remains,
just who on earth are you?

243
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,069
On Earth, I'm Lee.
Linda Lee.

244
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:42,078
- Where's your letter of recommendation?
- Letter?

245
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,555
I must talk to you, principal.

246
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,113
I am busy now.

247
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,630
So are they, them, all the little monsters
you admit to the place.

248
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,434
They have nailed
my desk drawers shut.

249
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,315
Never in all my years
as a school teacher. Come, Danvers.

250
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:00,110
I will not be provoked. I will not let him
get to me this semester.

251
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,995
I'll be strong. Be strong.
Be like a rock.

252
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:20,839
Now, what did you say your name was?
Oh, yes, yes. Linda Lee, huh?

253
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,110
Yes, my cousin probably wrote you.

254
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:26,710
Maybe you got his letter
under K for Kent. In your files.

255
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,593
Kent? Kent?

256
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:36,238
Doesn't ring any bells.
Doesn't even ring a-

257
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,550
Oh, here it is. Big as life.

258
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,196
"My dear Mr. Danvers. I'm writing
on behalf of a very special young lady. "

259
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,278
An orphan?

260
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,000
Don't expect to be treated
differently on that account, Miss Lee.

261
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,758
Oh, no, sir. I won't.

262
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:54,795
One way or another, we're alone
on this miserable little planet.

263
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,513
Yes, sir. I know.

264
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,434
Since your school records
were obviously lost in the mail...

265
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,797
...you'll have to start at the bottom.
Only fair to the other girls.

266
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,475
You'll have English, Latin,
math, biology, computing-

267
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,868
All at once?

268
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:12,955
- and chemistry. Idle hands
are the devil's playground. This way.

269
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,750
- Man on the floor!
- Man on the floor!

270
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,919
Open up, Lane. I know you're in there.

271
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:44,994
- I'm not decent, Mr. Danvers, sir.
- And you never will be either. Little liar.

272
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,515
Come on in. Come on in.
I haven't got all year.

273
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:52,314
No. I'm supposed to have
a single this term.

274
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,471
We don't always get
what we want, Miss Lane.

275
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,915
Disappointments thicken our skins.

276
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,429
Who wants thick skin?

277
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,957
I'm Linda Lee.

278
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,716
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

279
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,428
I'm Lucy Lane.

280
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,232
Lucy Lee, this is Linda Lane.

281
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,953
- No, it isn't.
- What?

282
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,276
- She's Linda Lee and I'm-
- Lucy Lane.

283
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,193
You two know each other?

284
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,038
Oh, no. We just met.

285
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,958
- When?
- Just now.

286
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,680
But we've known each other
for years, haven't we, Linda?

287
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:27,958
- Gee, I don't think I'm-
- Of course. The Daily Planet, of course.

288
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,873
Linda's cousin works there.
And your sister-

289
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,952
What's her name? The one that's
always calling me and bothering me.

290
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,429
- Lois.
- Yes, that's the one.

291
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,713
Anyway, show our new Miss Lee around,
Miss Lane.

292
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:45,754
By the way, she's an orphan. But
don't let her play on your sympathies.

293
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,714
- So, who's your cousin?
- Clark Kent.

294
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,192
You're kidding me.

295
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,675
Clark Kent's your cousin?
You're putting me on.

296
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,871
- You know him?
- Do I know him?

297
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:17,119
Does my sister know him?
Now, that's the big question.

298
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,910
I see. I guess if they work at the same
newspaper they must know each other.

299
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,800
- Well...
- Is this is where I sleep?

300
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,719
Well, this is your bed,
but we don't sleep around here.

301
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,559
Nonstop excitement in this dorm.

302
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,678
All the real dementals are sent here.

303
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,749
So, when is the rest
of your stuff arriving?

304
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,152
I don't have any other stuff.

305
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,157
What? It's all in that little bag?

306
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:47,030
Oh, well, you see, I have the means
to buy more. It's just-

307
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,993
Well, I just haven't
had the chance since-

308
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:08,559
- Do you know him?
- Superman? Sure.

309
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,194
My sister's got something going
with the big guy.

310
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,868
Hey, listen, you can borrow
any of my clothes any time you want.

311
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,270
Just dig in and help yourself.

312
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,119
Thank you. You're very kind.

313
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,476
He's a real character.

314
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,835
A real hunk.

315
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,589
I'll introduce you to him someday
if we wind up getting along.

316
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:37,835
Now then, focus your tiny minds on
the kind of problem that it used to take...

317
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,759
...weeks of thought
before the computer.

318
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,919
Even now it can take a long time
without certain algorithms...

319
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:50,916
...which, if you behave for two seconds,
I might reveal to you.

320
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:03,074
Love, hate, love, hate...
Love.

321
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:08,070
The cards have decided
that people will do anything for love.

322
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:13,271
They'll jump off cliffs for love.
They'll drown themselves like lemmings.

323
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:19,237
So I'll make everybody love me.

324
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,955
Oh, no chance. You're an awful person,
honey, remember? Forget it.

325
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:26,516
Use your imagination, pinhead.
That's what magic is all about.

326
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,990
Why are we not moving?

327
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,316
Because I'm in love.

328
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:39,232
Come here, you beautiful thing.

329
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,113
He's cute.

330
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,751
Hey, what's going on?

331
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:51,953
Here's an exercise in big numbers
I want you to try. It doesn't-

332
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,469
It's trying to tell me something.

333
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:59,515
- Well, what? That we're near danger?
- I don't know. How do I know?

334
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,792
- I know.
- Well, tell me.

335
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,710
- My prince has come.
- Oh, no.

336
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,230
I saw him first, Selena.
That's not fair. I copied his number first.

337
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,597
Well done. Now let's get out of here.

338
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:23,320
You've been given the average size
of a Chinese family...

339
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,631
...average age of death, of marriage,
average age of pregnancy.

340
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:30,913
Use this equation to compute
the population of China in the year 2040.

341
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:34,590
Linda.
Are you with us?

342
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,471
- Yes, sir, I am.
- Oh, are you?

343
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,591
Where, might I ask?

344
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,673
Well, here, sir. On Earth, sir.

345
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,269
How fortunate for the rest of us.

346
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:53,712
May I presume whilst you were staring
at the wall, and not at your terminal...

347
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,115
...like your other little friends here...

348
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:01,440
...you were, in fact, hard at work
solving this little equation?

349
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,278
Oh, yes, sir, I was.

350
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,152
- I mean, I was-
- Excellent.

351
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:10,388
The answer, please. Pay attention, class.
Miss Lee is about to enlighten us.

352
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:15,198
Five billion, two hundred and seventy
one million, nine thousand and ten.

353
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,153
Come on. Let's get out of here
before he makes you stay.

354
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:32,393
- Miss Lee.
- Oh, shit.

355
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,558
- Yes, sir?
- Have you been going through my papers?

356
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,159
Of course not, sir.

357
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,351
Then how do you know
the correct answer?

358
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,556
- How?
- I guess I just-

359
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,910
It's all this crazy weather
we've been having, sir.

360
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,759
All the storms, shock waves,
electromagnetism.

361
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,110
It makes people smarter
than they are for a second.

362
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,753
We gotta go, sir.

363
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,114
- Boy. Thanks. You know I gotta learn-
- How did you know the answer?

364
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,550
I don't know.
Six-dimensional geometry.

365
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,753
- I never could do it before.
- Yeah. You want some friendly advice?

366
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,554
Don't go showing it off,
because nobody's gonna like you.

367
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,716
I'll see you later.

368
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,876
Nice going.

369
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:24,796
- You know she tripped you on purpose?
- Absolutely.

370
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,991
She's retarded.

371
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:31,829
There's not much time left.
Come on, let's go.

372
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,471
You take it, Myra.

373
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,434
Hey, Myra, see if you can
put Lane out for good.

374
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,273
Come on, team.
Come on.

375
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,516
You guys all right?

376
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,831
- Oh, my God. What happened?
- You all right?

377
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,032
- Yes, I'm fine.
- How did she do that? It hit her shoulder.

378
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,152
Hey, you guys. Did you see
that cute guy in the softball field?

379
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,759
Oh, yes.

380
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,030
With the black hair
and the big muscles?

381
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,593
He was something else.

382
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,631
- Did you talk to him?
- No, but I'm gonna.

383
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,519
- Talk? Who wants to waste time talking?
- He's working on the trees.

384
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,511
He could be around for a while.

385
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,599
- Are they in?
- Yes.

386
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,790
Are you sure you wanna
go through with this?

387
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,520
Hey, what's with you?
Chicken shit?

388
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:33,589
Oh, boy, I'm really gonna enjoy this.
I can't wait to hear them scream.

389
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,678
But, Myra, why don't you shut off
the hot and give them an ice bath?

390
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,110
Are you kidding me?
That's nowheresville.

391
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,276
If you shut off the cold
you might scald them.

392
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:44,472
So they lose a little skin.
Serves them right.

393
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:47,148
I want to see them suffer.

394
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,317
I'm wet!

395
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,758
- Come on!
- Don't leave me. Don't leave me!

396
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,473
I hate you!

397
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,755
You never looked better!

398
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,235
We'll get you all!

399
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,873
- What do you think?
- It looks the same to me.

400
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,832
It's kind of dull.

401
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,713
All you need is a couple of streaks
and your ears pierced.

402
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,797
I can do it for you free of charge.

403
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,310
- My ears what?
- Pierced. Like, I take a needle...

404
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,353
...and then I heat it up, and then
I dab it with some alcohol and zap.

405
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,039
All the guys go crazy.

406
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,438
Because I have holes in my ears?

407
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,791
What are you, putting me on?

408
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,798
Sometimes I can't
figure you out, Linda.

409
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,754
- So where are you going this weekend?
- Nowhere.

410
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,396
Nowhere? Well, you can't stay
around here. This place is depressing.

411
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,068
- I mean, like the tombs.
- Why?

412
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,635
Why? What, were you born yesterday?

413
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,271
This is a three-day weekend.

414
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,550
A three-day weekend.

415
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:03,479
So listen. Why don't you
come home with me.

416
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:07,389
I live about five miles from here and I got
this guy coming up from Metropolis.

417
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,712
I think he knows your cousin,
Clark.

418
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:15,315
His name's Jimmy Olsen.
I think he's real stuck on me.

419
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:18,269
Anyways, I could ask him
to bring a friend along.

420
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,433
What are you doing?

421
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,995
Oh, nothing. Nothing.

422
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:27,988
No. I think I'm gonna stay here
and study. Get things organized.

423
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,958
Just a sec.

424
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,037
Hey, Linda. I'll see you later
at Popeye's then, okay?

425
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:41,152
- All right, I'll try. I promise.
- You better. It's gonna be fun.

426
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,276
- Bye-bye.
- Bye. Have a good time.

427
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,310
Come along now, Lucy.

428
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,999
Mom, how are you doing?

429
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,839
Mom, I've had a terrible week.

430
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,714
Get the dog in the car.

431
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:58,955
"Take a spider off his web...

432
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:03,595
...and shut him up inside...

433
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:07,759
...two shells of a nut.

434
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,151
Now boil the nut in oil...

435
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:16,672
...into which has been added
some of the web.

436
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:23,919
With a silver spoon,
put two drops of the oil...

437
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:27,909
...into some water. "

438
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,394
Right.

439
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:36,199
"He who drinks the water shall be in love
with the first person he sees...

440
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:39,911
...so long as the spider
is shut up in the nutshell...

441
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:45,353
...or one day goes by,
whichever comes first. "

442
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:49,439
Big deal, one day.
Why don't you just use, you know:

443
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:51,710
I'm saving it for bigger things.

444
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,150
Hi, folks, you're missing the big sale.

445
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:57,113
Country and western boys
from the Chicago area.

446
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,914
Now to start off the hour...

447
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:18,277
Bianca, get the door.

448
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,073
Bianca!

449
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,709
You rang? Hey, you!

450
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,432
I said, you rang?

451
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,518
Oh, yeah. How you doing?

452
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,549
I'm looking for some person
called Mrs. Selena?

453
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:46,036
Madame Selena.

454
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:49,912
And you've found her, lucky boy.

455
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,516
You must be very popular
in the neighborhood.

456
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,796
I always see your truck parked around.

457
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,391
Oh, yeah. I get a lot of repeat business.
People like my work.

458
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:08,513
Yes, I'm sure they do.

459
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,997
Wet your whistle?

460
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,670
Oh, yeah. As a matter of fact,
don't mind if I do.

461
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,310
So, where's the one at?

462
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,239
- It dropped dead.
- Where at exactly? Out back?

463
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,039
You know, I thought we might get
to know each other a little more...

464
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:58,035
...before we dig in
and talk real turkey.

465
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:01,913
Well, see, I'm kind of
a private person, you know.

466
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:05,874
- I mean, I do my work, I go home.
- To your wife?

467
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:10,551
No. At the present moment in time
I'm enjoying a single status in my life.

468
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:11,988
Cheers.

469
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:15,796
- Bottoms up, huh?
- Bottoms up.

470
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,390
I noticed you got a pretty
alkaline-looking soil out there.

471
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:29,238
What I want are some
houseplants inside here.

472
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:32,633
Something that goes well
with the house.

473
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:37,311
- This is a house?
- Of course it's a house.

474
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:40,478
There's the bedroom over there.

475
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:45,873
I think it's getting dark in here.

476
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:53,150
You know, what kind of plant
is gonna wanna grow in this dump?

477
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:55,828
I don't know.

478
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,118
Shade plants.

479
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:00,398
To us.

480
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:03,797
And to the seeds we'll plant together.

481
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,835
Yeah, I'll drink to that.

482
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,318
You probably killed him, you know.

483
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,594
Sleep well.

484
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:26,915
And when you wake,
drown in my eyes and be all mine.

485
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:31,557
If that's the goddamn
Jehovah's Witnesses again...

486
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,151
I'll get it.

487
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:42,753
Oh, hello, Nigel. It's you.

488
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,031
Nice suit.

489
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:48,074
- Subtle.
- I want to see Selena.

490
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,430
She's indisposed at the moment.

491
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:53,512
Whoever it is, we don't want any.

492
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:59,034
It's Nigel, and he's not going away
until he talks to you.

493
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:03,873
- What the devil do you want?
- I want to make a very serious proposal.

494
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:06,150
In that outfit?

495
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:08,715
This is a leisure suit.
I've got three days off...

496
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:12,350
...from those little beasts at Midvale
and I intend to let my hair down.

497
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:07,355
That ball will not operate at its fullest
until you internalize your power, Selena.

498
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:10,439
Some mosaic invocations.

499
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:11,993
- Some what?
- Come again?

500
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,037
Exactly. That's my point.

501
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:17,198
You girls are rank amateurs
playing with fire.

502
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:20,358
Because we own the matches.

503
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:25,275
I, of all people, know a hustle
when I hear one. Goodbye, Nigel.

504
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:28,040
- It was nice talking to you, Nigel.
- No, it wasn't.

505
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:32,552
- I hate to seem pushy, my fairest-
- A word of advice, Nigel.

506
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:35,871
If I had your skin problems,
I'd stop bothering people...

507
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:38,793
...put a bag over my head,
and go live under a bridge!

508
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,319
There's nothing wrong with my skin.

509
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:48,633
That bitch.

510
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:52,759
You know, some people.

511
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,074
Where is he?

512
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:57,592
Where is he?!

513
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:08,760
Where is he?

514
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:11,394
Whoever he sees first
he'll love with all his heart.

515
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:14,711
What? For a day tops, right? He was
too young for you anyway, you know.

516
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:18,953
No, I do not know. Where is he?

517
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:27,156
Hey, I know that guy.

518
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:35,915
- Oh, the cable's out.
- Oh, what cable?

519
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:38,429
This is a mirror.

520
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:42,636
So, how come
we could ever see him in it?

521
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:46,389
That was magic, damn it. The power.

522
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:49,548
Oh, so make it happen again,
you know?

523
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:54,475
I can't make it happen again.
I don't know how I did it the first time.

524
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:57,752
Maybe you should let that thing
out of its box, you know.

525
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:00,076
Maybe it's more powerful
if you let it out of its box.

526
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:01,633
- The box.
- The box.

527
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:03,239
- Where is it?
- The box?

528
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:06,910
It's underneath the rug
where you left it. Go ahead.

529
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,352
It's stuck.

530
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:20,835
This is not my day.

531
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:24,476
It's stuck? How could it be stuck?

532
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:26,557
It's growing.

533
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:29,752
How could it be growing?
It's made out of lead.

534
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:44,349
Too bad there's no sound.

535
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:46,671
How come there's no sound?

536
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,994
Get off the road, turkey!

537
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,630
Hey, dummy, you wanna die?

538
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:55,994
Stupid. You wanna kill yourself?

539
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:07,996
Anyway, she saw a lawyer,
and now she's gonna file.

540
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:11,072
I told her to take him for every cent.
Clean him out.

541
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,874
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

542
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,116
Here you go, everybody.

543
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,119
- Who wants onion rings?
- Yeah. Here.

544
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:23,554
- Thanks.
- Some french fries?

545
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:27,235
- French fries are mine.
- Chicken for myself. Thank you.

546
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:28,958
- Thanks.
- Side order of tomatoes?

547
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:31,953
- Thanks for inviting me, Lucy.
- I'm glad you could come, Jimmy.

548
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,913
- Who wanted root beer?
- Yeah, thanks.

549
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:36,469
Oh, there's Linda.

550
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:41,438
Hey, Linda!

551
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:43,232
- Hi.
- Oh, hello.

552
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:46,353
- That's Clark Kent's cousin?
- Who's Clark Kent?

553
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:48,272
Is that Linda?

554
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:51,959
- Guess what.
- What?

555
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:55,516
There's this all-night party tonight
at Eddie's. He's the guy with the tattoo.

556
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:56,954
His folks are out of town.

557
00:52:57,120 --> 00:53:00,351
And the guy with the bow tie,
that's Jimmy.

558
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:01,879
So you wanna come?

559
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:04,355
I don't know.
I'm not signed out for an overnight.

560
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:06,988
So what? Go back, sign in
and climb out the window.

561
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:10,875
Mrs. Murphy's drunk as a skunk by now,
totally on another planet.

562
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:13,196
Oh, I don't know.
It just doesn't seem right.

563
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:15,999
But that's why it'll be fun. Okay?

564
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:18,310
Okay.

565
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:19,873
Get off the road, buddy.

566
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:22,036
Hey, stupid.

567
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:25,237
- Look at that dingleberry.
- What's a dingleberry?

568
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:29,236
Hey, you, space cadet!
Get out of the street!

569
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:33,478
- What is wrong with him?
- I don't know.

570
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:37,195
He's probably on drugs. And he's gonna
get creamed if he's not too careful.

571
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:40,233
- Hi. Jimmy Olsen, photographer.
- I'm Kara.

572
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:41,668
- Who?
- Who?

573
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:46,590
I'm concerned, well, that if
we don't do something-

574
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:49,109
Yeah. You go out there and
try to help a guy like that...

575
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:52,590
...and he's probably got a gun or a knife,
you know. It's not too safe.

576
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,756
Hey, I'm starving. Let's eat.

577
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:56,797
Come on, Linda.

578
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:04,310
Power of Shadow

579
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:09,511
Bring him to me

580
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:49,272
Look at that.

581
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:20,633
- You've never seen a tattoo, Linda?
- Look!

582
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:22,831
- What's that?
- There's somebody hanging out of it.

583
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,116
Doesn't look like
there's anybody driving.

584
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:29,316
Oh, my God. It's a runaway.

585
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,996
- Somebody's gotta do something.
- What's she doing?

586
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:37,628
Lucy, be careful. Lucy!

587
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:40,479
- Come on.
- Lucy!

588
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:14,399
God, where's the pump?

589
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:54,636
- Oh, excuse me. I'm in a rush.
- I know the feeling.

590
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:00,588
Are you okay?

591
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:04,033
It's gasoline! It's gasoline!

592
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:18,033
A storm dragon?

593
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:22,233
A supergirl.

594
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:11,994
Oh, my God.

595
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:18,509
Don't. Don't look at her.

596
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:28,758
You're gonna be all right.
There's no broken bones.

597
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:36,716
I love you.

598
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:40,712
What did he say? What did he say?

599
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:42,792
Looked like "I love you" to me.

600
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,470
No! No!

601
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:48,591
You love me?

602
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:51,517
With all my heart forever.

603
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:55,914
A bird of free and careless wing
Was I through many a smiling spring.

604
01:00:56,120 --> 01:01:00,113
The cold repulse, the look askance,
The lightning of love's angry glance.

605
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:03,476
Let me behold you.

606
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:20,157
I have to go.

607
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:25,273
I have to go.

608
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:29,830
- Everything's under control.
- Lucy?

609
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:32,031
Just go on back to your homes.

610
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:33,593
Lucy.

611
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:36,476
Thank God.

612
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:40,188
- You all right?
- I think so.

613
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:41,879
I hit my head.

614
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:43,633
Nigel must know her.

615
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:46,832
She must be one of his students.
He must have put her up to it.

616
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:49,349
No. I don't think that at all.

617
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:53,269
She just happened to be in the wrong
place at the wrong time, right?

618
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:56,756
Materializing in a bulldozer, huh?

619
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:00,032
She's a wimpy little thing. I don't even
know why you care what she does.

620
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:03,232
Because nobody gets in my way.

621
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:07,194
Why don't you just leave this kid alone
and worry about the other one that flies.

622
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:11,075
I worry about everything.
It's my job. Stand back.

623
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:14,317
Oh, come on now.
She's just a teenager.

624
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:19,110
What good is a sword
if it's not unleashed?

625
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:21,629
But she's a total zero.
You don't even know her name.

626
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:25,230
The naming of names
is not necessary.

627
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:28,437
Let us concentrate on her face...

628
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:31,871
...and my Shadow will do the rest.

629
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:33,553
Your what?

630
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:38,840
Power of Shadow, take shape

631
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:42,874
Look like a vicious dark star

632
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:46,595
Seek out
That wretched young creature

633
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:51,351
And destroy her wherever she

634
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:53,948
Are

635
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:57,669
Oh, God, that's awful.
That's never gonna work.

636
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:17,357
Oh, my God.

637
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:46,191
Next time...

638
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:50,072
...remind me to do this outside.

639
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:28,797
Leave this place and do no harm.

640
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:33,079
There she is again.

641
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:35,598
What did she say?

642
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:39,679
No, this is not possible.
This is not right.

643
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:41,393
Where's the wimp?

644
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:59,275
I think he can take care of her.

645
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:23,758
See? What did I tell you?

646
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:25,439
She quit, right?

647
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:26,589
Wrong.

648
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:33,514
Every time! Every time!

649
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:37,190
Send a man to do a woman's job
and that's what you get.

650
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:40,836
Damn her eyes.
Who is she?

651
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:45,716
- Are you asking me?
- I'm telling you. Find out.

652
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:49,674
Well, sure. But, you know,
I think I recognize the costume.

653
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:58,317
Where have you been?

654
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:00,636
- Outside-
- Look at you.

655
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:02,439
Look at those clothes.

656
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:03,959
I'll go change. I'm sorry.

657
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:07,232
And you'll put on your
proper school uniform.

658
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:10,790
- And get out of that ridiculous costume.
- Yes, ma'am.

659
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,389
- And cover your legs.
- Yes, ma'am.

660
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:17,912
- Don't you "yes, ma'am" me.
- No, ma'am.

661
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:22,918
I think you're blowing this thing out
of proportion, if you want my opinion.

662
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:28,672
This box is definitely getting
bigger and uglier.

663
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:30,632
All I'm saying is you can't go nuts...

664
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:33,598
...over a landscape guy
and a teenager in a blue suit.

665
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:35,279
She flies.

666
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:40,110
Can you get that through your thick skull
and into your tiny brain, Bianca?

667
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:42,959
The girl can fly.

668
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:05,430
Okay. Now, let's get serious.

669
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:09,155
Come to mama.

670
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:36,679
- Selena, cut it out.
- I'm not doing it.

671
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:09,316
I think we're venturing where, you know,
fools rush in and angels fear to tread.

672
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:13,151
I'm no angel.

673
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:01,233
It's the wimp again.

674
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:04,396
And she's trespassing.

675
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:23,348
Hello.

676
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:25,755
Oh, no. Not now.

677
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:28,111
'Tis only but me, my love.

678
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:31,551
- Please, you'll let everyone know.
- What? That I love you?

679
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:34,991
- I'd shout it from the highest hill.
- Please don't.

680
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:37,628
I know you think me the fool,
but at least tell me your name.

681
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:39,438
Linda. Linda Lee.

682
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:43,519
Linda. Lovely Linda Lee.

683
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:45,671
These roses pale beside thee.

684
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:53,839
- Well, thank you, but I'm-
- Sweet chocolates for my sweet Linda.

685
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:05,995
What are you doing?

686
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:09,833
Please?

687
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:13,790
- Oh, no, I-
- Please?

688
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,911
Well, all right. But just for a minute.

689
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:31,430
You hate me, don't you?

690
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:33,995
Hate you? I don't even know you.

691
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:37,749
- I don't even know your name.
- Ethan.

692
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:41,475
Say my name aloud but once
and I shall die the happy fool.

693
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:43,557
Look, Ethan-

694
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:47,672
Ethan.

695
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:50,838
Ethan.

696
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:55,829
Your soft caress did at once renew
the beating of this broken heart.

697
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:58,995
Are you crazy?

698
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:02,599
Marry me?

699
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:14,877
Marry you?

700
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:18,516
- I don't-
- Don't say it. Don't, please. I know.

701
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:22,395
- What?
- We're from different worlds.

702
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:25,751
- You mean, you know where I'm-?
- Just give me a chance, Linda.

703
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:28,155
Love makes everything possible.

704
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:32,395
A poor uneducated gardener
can indeed worship a rich debutante...

705
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:34,158
...and make her happy if she'd just-

706
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:36,316
Oh, Ethan.

707
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:37,919
I'm not rich. I'm just-

708
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:41,595
Well, then I'll support us both.

709
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:47,073
You're nuts, you know that? You're
so sweet, but you're out of your mind.

710
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:50,113
Over you.

711
01:14:57,720 --> 01:15:01,076
What a touching scene.

712
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:35,634
Round and round they go
Where they stop

713
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:48,511
Boy, you're really getting
the hang of this.

714
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:58,111
Where is she?

715
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:03,192
Jesus.

716
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:05,359
Who are you?

717
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:08,600
I am Selena.

718
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:11,678
Diadanus of Catania,
priestess of Sechnid.

719
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:14,348
I am the ultimate Siren of Endor...

720
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:20,709
...and you, little lady, are trespassing
on private property.

721
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:22,074
She means him.

722
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:24,557
I am Kara of Argo City...

723
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:27,109
...daughter of Alura and Zor-El.

724
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:29,555
And I don't scare easily.

725
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:33,071
- No?
- No.

726
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:35,356
Try...

727
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,319
...this.

728
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:57,436
This lady is improving by
leaps and bounds, I gotta tell you.

729
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:18,588
You okay?

730
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:20,599
No.

731
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:24,874
You want a hacksaw or something?

732
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:40,872
Now I am really upset.

733
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:28,877
What's going on?

734
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:33,117
Put me down.

735
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:42,719
- Where am I?
- You're safe.

736
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:44,950
Safe? Where's Linda?

737
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:47,237
Put me down.

738
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:54,599
- Where's my Linda?
- Take it easy.

739
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:02,428
Ethan.

740
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:06,716
Very clever. That ought to keep her
out of your hair for a few hours.

741
01:20:07,160 --> 01:20:10,311
"Clever"? A cheap trick.

742
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:20,074
Power of Shadow
Bring him to me

743
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:30,352
Bring him to me

744
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:35,628
Didn't work, huh?
Maybe they're too far away.

745
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:38,479
I can make the sky rain coconuts
with pinpoint accuracy...

746
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:43,031
...but I still can't control men's minds.

747
01:20:43,240 --> 01:20:44,673
Not with her around.

748
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:48,156
So maybe-
Now, don't go through the roof.

749
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:52,751
But maybe we ought to back down
and give old you-know-who a call.

750
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:54,748
You know. "Who. "

751
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:56,598
- Spit it out.
- Nigel.

752
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:59,598
- I shall pretend you didn't say that.
- But I did.

753
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:03,554
All I'm thinking, and forgive me
for thinking of out of turn here...

754
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:06,320
...is that he's been around.

755
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:08,397
He knows things we don't.

756
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:12,798
Plus, the way you wrap him around
your little finger, I'm always amazed.

757
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:54,076
- What's in it for me?
- Me.

758
01:21:56,160 --> 01:21:57,434
My dear Nigel...

759
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:01,195
...the way to a woman's heart
is through the elimination of her rivals.

760
01:22:01,640 --> 01:22:04,916
- Murder. Are you proposing that-?
- Certainly not.

761
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:08,476
Leave that to me.
You deliver the goods.

762
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:10,910
- Her.
- Her? How?

763
01:22:11,480 --> 01:22:14,677
By getting me him.

764
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:17,678
- She'll follow.
- Well, I don't.

765
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:20,758
- Follow any of this, I mean.
- Put that down.

766
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:25,316
Nigel, I want one thing:

767
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:28,114
Time to master my new toy.

768
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:30,436
So we can rule the world?

769
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:34,550
And you want him here,
Johnny Appleseed, in your living room?

770
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:36,432
Yes, in the flesh.

771
01:22:36,640 --> 01:22:39,996
So she'll follow? No other reason?

772
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:43,237
- None.
- You're sure of that?

773
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:48,599
I'm sorry. The little spider got out.

774
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:50,439
What?

775
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:53,918
Where am I?

776
01:22:55,640 --> 01:22:58,074
- Who are you?
- Kara.

777
01:22:58,520 --> 01:22:59,555
Kara?

778
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:04,677
- What happened?
- You got hit on the head by a coconut.

779
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:10,149
What's with the Halloween costume?

780
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:13,839
This is not a costume.
These are my clothes.

781
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:17,272
- What do you mean?
- Look, I have to go now.

782
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:20,876
I will come back for you later, I promise.
I've gotta get to the amusement park.

783
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:23,759
Amusement park?
Linda.

784
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:27,679
I gotta find Linda. She was in trouble.

785
01:23:27,880 --> 01:23:31,316
Oh, Linda's all right.
She can take care of herself.

786
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:34,990
No, no, no, she can't. Something's
wrong. She's in big trouble and I love her.

787
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:37,158
I love her.

788
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:39,593
Yeah, I do love her.

789
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:46,715
- I have to go, Ethan. Goodbye.
- Yes, so do I.

790
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:48,958
Hey.

791
01:23:53,720 --> 01:23:56,154
I told you Linda
can take care of herself.

792
01:23:56,320 --> 01:23:58,038
You just flew over my head.
I saw you.

793
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:01,317
- I'll go back and take care of everything.
- You just flew over my head, true?

794
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:04,473
True.

795
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,798
- Like Superman.
- He's my cousin.

796
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:12,669
- He's your cousin?
- Yes. I shouldn't be telling you this. I'm-

797
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:15,713
Wait. You can do the whole number?
Leap tall buildings in a single bound?

798
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:18,235
- And look right through things?
- Yes.

799
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:21,074
- Bend steel bars?
- Yes.

800
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:26,554
Oh, Selena. I have to go.
Selena has the omegahedron.

801
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:29,320
Wait, take me with you.
I have to find Linda.

802
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:35,519
- What is it?
- The Burundi Wand.

803
01:24:35,680 --> 01:24:38,717
Pure unadulterated evil.

804
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:41,192
Ready?

805
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:11,717
But how can you love her?
You don't even know her.

806
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:13,074
Oh, yeah, I do.

807
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:16,989
If she's in trouble then I got no
business standing here talking with you.

808
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:21,432
- Even if you are what you say you are.
- Linda is not in trouble.

809
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:24,359
Look, don't make me get rough, okay?

810
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:27,154
You wouldn't stand a chance.

811
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:29,157
Please trust me.

812
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:31,715
Linda is all right.

813
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:33,952
How do you know?

814
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:36,237
I just-

815
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:38,519
Know.

816
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:51,598
Linda.

817
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:04,715
Oh, my God.
How did you do that?

818
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:11,439
Ethan.

819
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:14,873
Ethan.

820
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:21,879
Nigel, you are wonderful.

821
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:24,992
Pure genius.

822
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:29,229
You deserve me.

823
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:52,914
Something else.

824
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:03,358
Now, let's get out of this dump.

825
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:08,631
Hey, what's the matter?
Catching flies?

826
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:11,030
Lucy, look.

827
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:14,796
One minute that,
and the next minute this.

828
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:16,797
What is it?

829
01:27:18,040 --> 01:27:20,349
It's a mountain, Lucy. Isn't it?

830
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:23,154
- Tell me I'm not seeing things.
- How did it get there, Jimmy?

831
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:25,072
I don't know.
It just appeared.

832
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:27,435
How can a mountain just appear?

833
01:27:27,680 --> 01:27:29,750
Hey, there's something at the top.

834
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:33,676
- Looks like a castle.
- It's more like a fortress.

835
01:28:20,680 --> 01:28:22,398
Ethan?

836
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:30,312
Ethan.

837
01:29:00,440 --> 01:29:02,078
Ethan.

838
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:31,436
Enjoy your prison, Supergirl.

839
01:29:31,960 --> 01:29:35,999
Forever and ever.

840
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:42,310
No, Ethan! Don't do it!

841
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:45,195
Ethan!

842
01:31:11,080 --> 01:31:13,958
Where am I?

843
01:32:30,640 --> 01:32:33,154
You can't arrest me
without a warrant.

844
01:32:43,320 --> 01:32:44,309
Slow down.

845
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:46,072
We want Selena out!

846
01:32:47,680 --> 01:32:51,389
Smile, lunkhead. You're not a gardener
anymore. You're Prince Ethan now.

847
01:32:51,560 --> 01:32:54,279
- Are we gonna stand up to her or not?
- Yeah!

848
01:32:54,440 --> 01:32:56,032
Selena must go!

849
01:32:56,200 --> 01:32:57,918
Who's this little twerpette?

850
01:32:58,120 --> 01:32:59,599
She's someone who believes in freedom.

851
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:01,796
Lucy, it's not a good time
to express yourself.

852
01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:04,997
I don't know who you think you are,
or what evil force you represent.

853
01:33:05,160 --> 01:33:08,197
But if you think you can just get rid
of anybody who stands up to you...

854
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:11,278
...just make them disappear,
like my friend Linda...

855
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:13,637
- Who?
- Linda, my roommate.

856
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:16,075
She disappeared the day
that mountain showed up.

857
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:20,873
- The wimp.
- The wimp.

858
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:22,875
Seize them.

859
01:33:26,960 --> 01:33:28,712
Drive off.

860
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:32,112
- Let me go!
- Nobody messes with Jimmy Olsen!

861
01:33:32,280 --> 01:33:35,317
Now, let go of me. I'm with the press!

862
01:34:46,640 --> 01:34:49,438
- Zaltar.
- Squirt?

863
01:34:51,800 --> 01:34:54,678
- Zaltar?
- Squirt.

864
01:34:56,480 --> 01:35:00,837
- Zaltar, it's me. It's Kara.
- I know.

865
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:04,192
Squirt?

866
01:35:09,240 --> 01:35:10,878
What is that?

867
01:35:11,800 --> 01:35:14,792
- Where are we?
- Nowhere.

868
01:35:17,680 --> 01:35:21,639
- The Phantom Zone?
- It's lonely here, my Kara.

869
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:24,631
So sad.

870
01:35:26,680 --> 01:35:30,753
I've been here forever
and I shall stay here forever.

871
01:35:33,040 --> 01:35:34,678
- Ethan?
- Yes, my darling.

872
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:37,519
Don't call me your "darling. "
You despise me.

873
01:35:37,720 --> 01:35:40,598
- Get me the Coffer of Shadow.
- Yes, my darling.

874
01:35:43,200 --> 01:35:47,796
I think we need something...

875
01:35:48,640 --> 01:35:50,119
...there.

876
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:55,389
Oh, Jimmy.

877
01:35:56,880 --> 01:36:01,670
Oh, terrific.
The old dangling-in-a-cage routine.

878
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:04,474
Pathetic, Selena.

879
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:08,318
- Who is that guy?
- He's my math teacher, I think.

880
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:09,714
What are they for?

881
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:12,709
Insurance.

882
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:19,192
But you can't just give up.

883
01:36:19,360 --> 01:36:22,352
- You founded a whole city.
- I did.

884
01:36:22,520 --> 01:36:26,149
And then I doomed it to destruction.
That was an error. A tragic one.

885
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:29,918
When you're my age and you make
as many tragic errors as I do...

886
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:32,435
...it is a different tune
that you will sing.

887
01:36:32,640 --> 01:36:34,631
I will not. I will never give up.

888
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:38,554
I will never spend my entire life
in a place like this. I would die first!

889
01:36:38,760 --> 01:36:43,595
Strong words. There are worse things
than dying and I deserve every one.

890
01:36:59,680 --> 01:37:02,274
- What is this?
- A horse.

891
01:37:02,440 --> 01:37:03,429
I think.

892
01:37:04,200 --> 01:37:08,352
On Earth, I think it's called a horse.

893
01:37:08,720 --> 01:37:11,234
And you made this here?

894
01:37:13,640 --> 01:37:16,074
- Then you haven't given up.
- Don't be ridiculous.

895
01:37:16,240 --> 01:37:20,279
Earth, Zaltar, Earth. A tree, a horse.
You keep making things from Earth.

896
01:37:20,440 --> 01:37:22,271
- The place intrigues me.
- Then let's go there.

897
01:37:22,440 --> 01:37:24,032
Certainly. When is the next train?

898
01:37:25,960 --> 01:37:27,996
What is a train?

899
01:37:30,240 --> 01:37:33,312
What's so funny?
Don't laugh at me, Zaltar.

900
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:39,157
I'm only laughing at myself.
For you, I weep.

901
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:44,951
- Is this train a way out of here?
- There is no way out of here.

902
01:37:45,160 --> 01:37:47,993
That is the point of the Phantom Zone.

903
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:51,192
My neighbors now: The criminals,
the corrupt, the evil.

904
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:55,632
They're here, over the hill there,
with no way out.

905
01:37:56,360 --> 01:37:59,591
But there's always a way out.

906
01:38:00,040 --> 01:38:03,157
If there's a way in,
there's a way out.

907
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:06,874
There is a way.

908
01:38:08,480 --> 01:38:10,675
- But it's impossible.
- Why?

909
01:38:10,840 --> 01:38:12,956
No. It wouldn't work.

910
01:38:13,160 --> 01:38:15,913
You'll be swept into a singularity
if it didn't work. No.

911
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:18,948
Forget I mentioned it.
Have a squirt instead.

912
01:38:24,080 --> 01:38:25,399
I could do it.

913
01:38:28,680 --> 01:38:32,468
- Then please, at least teach me how.
- There's nothing to teach.

914
01:38:32,680 --> 01:38:37,879
You can't, as they say, practice
at the rift. You get one chance.

915
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:41,551
- The rift.
- Sure you won't have a squirt?

916
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:45,036
Once you get used to it,
I think it's delicious.

917
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:52,279
You're right.

918
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:56,110
You are absolutely right.

919
01:38:58,240 --> 01:39:01,357
There is enough doom and gloom
in the air already.

920
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:04,432
And it is better to accept defeat
than to take a chance...

921
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:08,513
...and try like fools to redeem ourselves,
save our city and those we love there...

922
01:39:08,680 --> 01:39:11,240
...plus all the people on Earth
that this wicked sorceress...

923
01:39:11,400 --> 01:39:14,995
...is going to make suffer
just because of us. Cheers.

924
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:20,311
We could die trying.

925
01:39:21,440 --> 01:39:23,192
We won't.

926
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:26,039
We won't. Come on.

927
01:39:52,520 --> 01:39:54,078
Tomorrow...

928
01:39:54,280 --> 01:39:56,999
...Thursday, Friday.

929
01:39:57,160 --> 01:39:59,469
Just like here,
we go for the cops first, right?

930
01:39:59,640 --> 01:40:01,312
And the Army.

931
01:40:01,480 --> 01:40:06,395
By Saturday, we have the continental
United States, Mexico, Canada.

932
01:40:10,400 --> 01:40:12,470
Oh, my God, Selena. It's the box.

933
01:40:12,680 --> 01:40:15,069
- Hush it up.
- No.

934
01:40:15,240 --> 01:40:20,189
What the box wants, the box gets.

935
01:40:34,520 --> 01:40:35,999
What is it?

936
01:40:36,160 --> 01:40:37,832
Fascinating.

937
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:41,992
I don't know.

938
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:45,989
Is this it? Is this the way out?

939
01:40:46,160 --> 01:40:50,472
Not yet. This is the Quantum Vortex.

940
01:40:50,680 --> 01:40:53,797
We must risk our destruction in it.

941
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:58,039
To move mountains,
you must make sacrifices.

942
01:40:58,200 --> 01:41:00,236
Zaltar, I'm scared.

943
01:41:00,440 --> 01:41:03,000
Accept your fears.

944
01:41:03,200 --> 01:41:09,150
Confront your demons.
Find your destiny in the maelstrom.

945
01:41:57,280 --> 01:41:59,077
Zaltar, I can't. I can't.

946
01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:00,999
You...

947
01:42:01,160 --> 01:42:02,275
...can.

948
01:42:26,280 --> 01:42:28,635
Two specks. Look.

949
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:36,636
What do I do?

950
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:40,396
How do you murder someone
in the Phantom Zone?

951
01:42:44,160 --> 01:42:48,073
- She's with some old guy, it looks like.
- Move, huh?

952
01:42:48,280 --> 01:42:51,829
- Come on.
- Calm down, okay?

953
01:42:53,080 --> 01:42:56,390
This is what I want.

954
01:42:56,560 --> 01:42:59,472
The Salian Fireballs.

955
01:42:59,680 --> 01:43:03,514
Page 321, chapter six.

956
01:43:20,360 --> 01:43:21,873
What's that?

957
01:43:53,720 --> 01:43:55,233
"Power of rainmaking. " No!

958
01:43:55,400 --> 01:43:58,119
"How to separate husband and wife. "
No. Not now, not now.

959
01:43:58,280 --> 01:44:01,716
Well, you better find something fast,
like an atom bomb.

960
01:44:12,920 --> 01:44:14,592
I found it.

961
01:44:15,560 --> 01:44:20,315
Summoning the Demon storm.

962
01:44:20,520 --> 01:44:24,672
We go higher, girl!

963
01:44:24,880 --> 01:44:27,348
- Higher!
- Come with me.

964
01:44:27,560 --> 01:44:31,394
I am with you. On, girl!

965
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:46,514
I am with you.

966
01:44:49,720 --> 01:44:51,153
Zaltar!

967
01:45:42,280 --> 01:45:43,793
Oh, thank God.

968
01:45:47,400 --> 01:45:50,517
You've had your fun, Selena.
The game is finished.

969
01:45:50,720 --> 01:45:51,755
Hardly.

970
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:56,675
One false step, bluebird,
and even if you don't...

971
01:45:56,840 --> 01:45:59,274
...your friends will get the point.

972
01:46:01,840 --> 01:46:02,955
Hey, no!

973
01:46:10,320 --> 01:46:11,594
I don't like this.

974
01:46:11,800 --> 01:46:14,268
Don't worry, Lucy. Don't worry.

975
01:46:15,880 --> 01:46:20,351
- I wouldn't, if I were you.
- Well, you're not me.

976
01:46:28,680 --> 01:46:30,989
Quick, get out of the way!
Into the alcove over there.

977
01:46:31,200 --> 01:46:34,078
- Come on.
- Hurry, Jimmy. Hurry.

978
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:41,319
The omegahedron, Selena. I want it.

979
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:47,197
Well, then, Supergirl,
you shall have it.

980
01:47:30,040 --> 01:47:32,554
Supergirl, above you. Look out!

981
01:47:45,600 --> 01:47:49,036
I think I'll be going,
if you'll excuse me.

982
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:56,639
That's what I said.
I'm staying, I'm staying.

983
01:48:09,920 --> 01:48:12,354
You have no friends, Selena.

984
01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:15,996
You treat everyone as if
they were put on this earth to serve you.

985
01:48:16,880 --> 01:48:19,553
More or less, I think they were.

986
01:48:19,760 --> 01:48:21,990
You included.

987
01:48:24,840 --> 01:48:31,313
Power of Shadow
Appear

988
01:48:49,360 --> 01:48:51,954
Power of Shadow

989
01:48:53,720 --> 01:48:56,280
Destroy her

990
01:49:49,560 --> 01:49:52,552
I can't.

991
01:49:53,360 --> 01:49:55,271
I can't.

992
01:49:55,480 --> 01:49:58,472
You can.

993
01:49:59,480 --> 01:50:02,040
On, girl.

994
01:50:21,200 --> 01:50:23,794
Confront her with it.
It's the only way!

995
01:51:44,520 --> 01:51:47,830
I have to go. I have to return this
to where it belongs.

996
01:51:48,040 --> 01:51:49,632
And I must ask you all something.

997
01:51:49,840 --> 01:51:52,400
It's all right, Supergirl.
We never saw you.

998
01:51:52,600 --> 01:51:55,512
- We never even heard of you.
- Thank you.

999
01:51:56,120 --> 01:51:58,156
Ethan. Linda, she-

1000
01:51:58,360 --> 01:52:00,191
She had to leave in a hurry but she-

1001
01:52:00,360 --> 01:52:02,555
You don't have to say a word.

1002
01:52:02,760 --> 01:52:04,273
I know.

1003
01:52:09,680 --> 01:52:12,035
I'll explain about Linda.

1004
01:52:13,360 --> 01:52:15,157
Thank you, Ethan.

1005
01:52:15,960 --> 01:52:17,393
Take care of yourself, kiddo.

1006
01:52:41,080 --> 01:52:43,116
That was some kiss.

1007
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:47,991
Goodbye, Linda.

1008
01:52:48,991 --> 01:52:58,991
