Want to see pipiþe a crazy? I have

2
00:00:13,012 --> 00:00:16,154

3
00:00:16,155 --> 00:00:19,252

Offer is valid now and some

5
00:00:22,167 --> 00:00:25,051
parts of the wardrobe and other accessories
atypical for sexual fantasies,

6
00:00:25,052 --> 00:00:27,666
who are also mad and I am
same type of "Puicuþele a crazy".

7
00:00:27,667 --> 00:00:30,833
But I and a crazy announcement made:
"Comandaþi now.

8
00:00:32,048 --> 00:00:34,249
- Harold?
- Fri, dear.

9
00:00:42,502 --> 00:00:46,136
It ... debt to my father ...

10
00:00:46,351 --> 00:00:51,527
you bring to our attention that ... men,
boys and men are creatures

11
00:00:51,528 --> 00:00:55,966
disgusting creatures who
one thing in mind ...

12
00:01:04,657 --> 00:01:10,758
You have reached the years where ... where ... where
boys will begin to notice.

13
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:12,986
And will begin to want
things from you.

14
00:01:12,987 --> 00:01:16,338
Horrible, sick,
disgusting things.

15
00:01:16,339 --> 00:01:17,978
Things that we do not offer.

16
00:01:17,979 --> 00:01:20,827
What he does not want to say that
sex is an evil thing.

17
00:01:20,828 --> 00:01:23,713
Sex is a great spiritual document.

18
00:01:23,714 --> 00:01:25,953
But you would have to
never do ...

19
00:01:28,834 --> 00:01:31,295
AMERICAN VIRGIN

20
00:01:31,551 --> 00:01:34,189
The idea is that he must
keep your ...

21
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:36,053
Because someday you'll meet the man
that you your marriage.

22
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:38,526
And when that happens,
he will have eyes only for you.

23
00:01:38,527 --> 00:01:41,072
And at least occasionally and that of the lemon
marketing department.

24
00:01:41,073 --> 00:01:43,618
It was the Christmas party
office and just dog had died.

25
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:46,233
I saw how it is concerned are,
damn, you do not think I do not see.

26
00:01:46,234 --> 00:01:47,568
Now is the time.

27
00:01:52,354 --> 00:01:55,007
So until you are happy
and married.

28
00:01:55,008 --> 00:01:57,259
Not even you think ...

29
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,656
Put chewing gum
aside.

30
00:01:59,657 --> 00:02:02,431
Do not want to do sex but baby,
no that's not gum ...

31
00:02:02,432 --> 00:02:04,524
... This is a condom.

32
00:02:07,383 --> 00:02:10,557
Be absolutely sure you have the will
a condom.

33
00:02:10,558 --> 00:02:13,309
But make sure you do not
never use.

34
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,655
Because if one do,
you will kill.

35
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:19,365
That much we love you.

36

all country we want to show that

39
00:02:34,949 --> 00:02:38,814
America is no country that wants

40
00:02:38,815 --> 00:02:40,110
November follow Daddy.

41

It is a country of culture and the curve are
morality a reality show.

49
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,987
At last year's guidance
campus of the College "Hurry Love"

50
00:03:23,988 --> 00:03:27,193
I intend to follow the successful
University of Michigan

sacred abstinenþã close to my heart.

52
00:03:33,986 --> 00:03:38,977

53
00:03:42,184 --> 00:03:45,764

Thank you, thank you,

57
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:05,124
I am so grateful

58
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:07,082
for inspiration and power.

59
00:04:07,606 --> 00:04:10,125
I wish also to thank them
My mother and father

60
00:04:10,126 --> 00:04:13,194
for implementation in me the values
which brought me here today.

61
00:04:13,679 --> 00:04:17,460
The College Pendington promised to
maintain standards decenþã

62
00:04:17,461 --> 00:04:21,097
and morality on which this
organization represents.

63
00:04:21,098 --> 00:04:27,143
And as Mary Margaret said with
passion: "Our body, our temple.

64
00:04:28,664 --> 00:04:30,694
<i> Priscilla White 100% pure. </ i></i>

65
00:04:34,898 --> 00:04:38,948
It seems that just as I returned from
college and after a few weeks ...

66
00:04:38,949 --> 00:04:42,529
- I do not even mention.
- Come on honey, do not be so bad.

67
00:04:43,115 --> 00:04:45,096
Pennington and Michigan is
a few hours away.

68
00:04:45,097 --> 00:04:47,429
Five hours and forty minutes.

69
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:51,831
That if you go the speed autobandã
constant of 80km / h.

70
00:04:51,832 --> 00:04:54,379
But if you're caught in a
melee of traffic ...

71
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:57,972
Okay, okay, okay, so it will be
easy to visit us each other.

72
00:04:58,196 --> 00:05:01,900
- Are you sure you want this for me?
- I'm sure.

73
00:05:07,758 --> 00:05:09,539
My God!

74
00:05:10,869 --> 00:05:13,728
- This is simply disgusting.
- Oh!

75
00:05:13,729 --> 00:05:16,269
Yes, right there!

76
00:05:16,544 --> 00:05:20,225
And not even realize how poor woman
horrible is exploited?

77
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,335
Yes, it is operated at
most miserable way.

78
00:05:26,105 --> 00:05:28,923
I wish only to go up there and
to say a few words.

79
00:05:28,924 --> 00:05:30,269
And I.

80
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,018
Poor her.

81
00:05:37,453 --> 00:05:40,710
Yes, yes sir, yes!

82
00:05:44,328 --> 00:05:46,231
Tell me about it?

83
00:05:47,068 --> 00:05:48,980
College Pennington
First Semester

84
00:05:55,841 --> 00:05:59,351
Mother, father, goodbye, we'll call
every day.

85
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:24,151
- Hi.
- Beautiful pillows.

86
00:06:24,152 --> 00:06:25,376
Thank you.

87
00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:28,769
- I'm Priscilla.
- Chuck.

88
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:29,946
Nice to meet you.

89
00:06:29,947 --> 00:06:32,113
So, you will be neighbor of
next year, right?

90
00:06:32,114 --> 00:06:33,156
Yes!

91
00:06:35,221 --> 00:06:37,819
Nice, so we build tunnel up
the walls tonight.

92
00:06:37,821 --> 00:06:41,759
Chuck, get off the front of the
us because in.

93
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,178
Do you like to design?

94
00:06:43,179 --> 00:06:45,660
You want all prospãturile or
they want and Chuck?

95
00:06:45,661 --> 00:06:48,659
Police know and the doctor said Sheryn
clearly, without poliþianisme.

96
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:52,487
Friends ... it is Priscilla.

97
00:06:53,672 --> 00:06:56,694
Sorry, I'm Eileen, live with
one floor below.

98
00:06:56,695 --> 00:06:58,240
He is my friend Kevin.

99
00:06:59,661 --> 00:07:02,197
- Hi.
- What are you doing?

100
00:07:02,198 --> 00:07:04,484
I align the books that you are
seeing titles.

101
00:07:04,485 --> 00:07:08,968
It is hard to read titles of children
if they are to and from the large set.

102
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,464
Why not separate small
of the children?

103
00:07:11,465 --> 00:07:13,603
And to them out of alphabetical order?

104
00:07:13,604 --> 00:07:15,301
So who is mate
your room?

105
00:07:18,778 --> 00:07:20,064
- Natalie Reed.
- Naz?

106
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:22,689
- A knowledge are?
- Everybody knows.

107
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:25,024
It never graduate, that will be of
and her seventh year.

108
00:07:25,025 --> 00:07:26,626
You and your roommate with Naz?

109
00:07:26,627 --> 00:07:29,185
What happened with the last fellow
room, Judy or ...

110
00:07:29,186 --> 00:07:32,431
- Jaimmy, expelled!
- Expelled, why?

111
00:07:32,432 --> 00:07:35,008
Not quite sure what
was charged ...

112
00:07:35,009 --> 00:07:37,530
... stuff like that happens when
Naz is around.

113
00:07:37,531 --> 00:07:39,552
Do not you worry, not even
so bad.

114
00:07:39,553 --> 00:07:43,847
No, not so bad, is in
order, is very good.

115
00:07:43,848 --> 00:07:46,774
I'm proud of the fact that I
understand by everyone

116
00:07:46,775 --> 00:07:48,925
and I'm sure that it will not
be an exception.

117
00:08:12,344 --> 00:08:16,664
Hey, you must be ... Priscilla.

118
00:08:17,392 --> 00:08:20,357
I am Naz, and you guess whose
Roommates.

119
00:08:20,358 --> 00:08:22,286
Do not be ridiculous.

120
00:08:26,899 --> 00:08:29,153
Nice to meet you
finally.

121
00:08:29,448 --> 00:08:35,017
I took the freedom to make cabinet
Right, but the left is empty.

122
00:08:35,018 --> 00:08:37,386
Organized, right? Should I

123
00:08:44,966 --> 00:08:46,638
Ready.

124
00:08:51,329 --> 00:08:53,323
That is a beautiful vase.

125
00:08:53,727 --> 00:08:55,462
You're funny, I like that.

126
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:59,556
Lord, what will the bedrooms this,
always smells of urine.

127
00:08:59,781 --> 00:09:01,710
I remember less of Junimea.

128
00:09:10,401 --> 00:09:13,999
God, on my life, I do not get
remember what is this.

129
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:16,896
Then ...

130
00:09:20,898 --> 00:09:22,529
Please tell me that is a device
back massage.

131
00:09:22,704 --> 00:09:27,126
Oh, Vlad king,
are welcome to it împrumuþi.

132
00:09:27,127 --> 00:09:29,213
As long as you clean the after using.

133
00:09:29,214 --> 00:09:32,458
But that and word of warning,
If you've never used one of this

134
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:33,924
do not put intense vibrations.

135
00:09:33,926 --> 00:09:36,817
I swear to God that you will
shot up in the deep.

136
00:09:39,891 --> 00:09:41,550
Smile and you.

137
00:09:43,939 --> 00:09:48,259
- I'd like to change my roommate.
- Well honey, I'll put the name on the list.

138
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:51,087
And if anything, Do you and give the tire.

139
00:09:51,088 --> 00:09:55,949
But until that happen you with
today you will become the best colleagues.

140
00:09:55,950 --> 00:10:00,200
- You do not understand!
- Mate your room is Naz?

141
00:10:00,201 --> 00:10:02,689
Brad is definitely horrible.

142
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:06,316
He also put things in a bag
as rectum and degenerated.

143
00:10:06,491 --> 00:10:11,331
You know you, the one with the umbrella, with children,
then the flight and music.

144
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:14,932
Do not you worry dear, can they find
another room for you.

145
00:10:14,933 --> 00:10:15,986
Brad, live in Festival in October?

146
00:10:15,987 --> 00:10:16,894
What is the sound of that?

147
00:10:16,895 --> 00:10:19,887
Only some children gãlãgio and here
in ... library.

148
00:10:29,531 --> 00:10:33,589
- Brad, I'm so missing you.
- Priss, do not you hear, you hear me?

149
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:38,941
- Brad, Brad, Brad you ...
- Bad connection.

150
00:10:38,942 --> 00:10:42,215

You take checks? I thought that
I could go on Mol.

154
00:11:24,387 --> 00:11:27,653
- Need to learn.
- Kevin, baby.

155
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:29,899
- Dear, and I do that.
- Do you do that?

156
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,110
Let me tell you that. He did not say
Dr. Sherry we should

157
00:11:32,111 --> 00:11:34,393
to work in compliance with program
to learn of Kevin?

158
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:36,267
But you should spend
time together.

159
00:11:36,635 --> 00:11:39,046
It is as if Ala is prologue
important than me.

160
00:11:39,047 --> 00:11:40,227
The prologue shit is killing me.

161
00:11:40,228 --> 00:11:44,645
- Dude, go to deliberate, is easy.
- You are not intentional.

162
00:11:44,863 --> 00:11:47,211
You say this just to impress girls.

163
00:11:47,212 --> 00:11:49,117
And speaking of ...

164
00:11:49,118 --> 00:11:54,241
I think I have a new patient,
five minutes and eat my hands.

165
00:11:54,242 --> 00:11:56,245
Enter doctor.

166
00:11:56,439 --> 00:12:02,317
Hi Priscilla, is a show in
campus tonight, I want you and accompanies you?

167
00:12:02,896 --> 00:12:04,301
We have to learn.

168
00:12:05,064 --> 00:12:07,450
But it will be a unique spectacle,
candlelight,

169
00:12:07,451 --> 00:12:10,307
books with pictures, numbers illusions.

170
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:13,817
No thanks, we'll go another time.

171
00:12:16,349 --> 00:12:17,791
Ah ... yes!

172
00:12:19,665 --> 00:12:21,269
Hey, what happened?

173
00:12:21,313 --> 00:12:22,532
Who is that?

174
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:25,622
Priscilla, this is John, John, my colleague
Priscilla room.

175
00:12:25,724 --> 00:12:28,589
My name is James, actually.

176
00:12:28,868 --> 00:12:31,059
- Hi.
- She is Diana.

177
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,632
Sandra.

178
00:12:34,118 --> 00:12:36,788
We continue once,
I lose my mood.

179
00:12:41,934 --> 00:12:43,795
Hey, wait, come and join us.

180
00:12:49,764 --> 00:12:52,193
Hi Priscilla,
running "Made in Manhattan"

181
00:12:52,194 --> 00:12:54,392
students at home tonight.
Want to come?

182
00:12:54,393 --> 00:12:57,652
I love that movie ...
but can not.

183
00:13:00,037 --> 00:13:02,117
But Wednesday, want to come to
party players?

184
00:13:02,118 --> 00:13:03,826
I friend.

185
00:13:21,321 --> 00:13:25,393
- So, as long as you do?
- 18 minutes and 37 seconds.

186
00:13:26,178 --> 00:13:32,191
Not ... as new freshman I have
said two words.

187
00:13:42,091 --> 00:13:44,033
Can you please do not do that.

188
00:13:44,923 --> 00:13:48,861
- Just relax, are just pictures.
- I meant to not smoke marijuana.

189
00:13:48,863 --> 00:13:51,138
Who has done on this,
are crap.

190
00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:54,399
Strange composition, exposure bad.

191
00:13:55,995 --> 00:13:58,806
This is your friend?
I like guys who have

192
00:13:58,807 --> 00:14:01,556
bãþul baseball back,
have a red status as u.

193
00:14:01,557 --> 00:14:03,357
Give me it back. Ending.

194
00:14:03,358 --> 00:14:07,125
Girls who are unable to abþine
status of sex.

195
00:14:07,126 --> 00:14:10,345
Holy shit, are you.
It is a picture of you.

196
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:15,933
Jokes are like, damn, you're a
sort by Virginia Professional?

197
00:14:15,934 --> 00:14:18,385
Not only believe in sex before
marriage.

198
00:14:18,386 --> 00:14:20,603
- Not even with you însãþi?
- What?

199
00:14:20,604 --> 00:14:23,886
Do not tell me that does not put his hand
as of and ternuturi

200
00:14:23,887 --> 00:14:25,383
you are in bed and not start
some digital actions.

201
00:14:28,494 --> 00:14:33,241
You know you, scuturând grain of beans,
aþâþând button and your polished piece door.

202
00:14:33,242 --> 00:14:37,609
If you mean masturbation,
if not, I do not do that.

203
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,591
As always said Mary Margaret
"Our body is our temple"

204
00:14:40,592 --> 00:14:42,071
and must be treated as such.

205
00:14:42,072 --> 00:14:44,850
It appears that you treat it your
as an amusement park.

206
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:46,470
- Which Mary?
- It does not matter.

207
00:14:49,383 --> 00:14:53,950
I think sex is a sacred act between:
a man, a woman and God.

208
00:14:54,114 --> 00:14:56,308
- What is the right thing by hand?
- No!

209
00:14:56,309 --> 00:14:59,954
Manual stimulation of the phallus is
sexual.

210
00:14:59,955 --> 00:15:01,216
Handling whom?

211
00:15:01,217 --> 00:15:04,261
Biggus, genitals,
male member.

212
00:15:04,262 --> 00:15:06,435
A You mean achievement
"tool" type?

213
00:15:06,436 --> 00:15:08,642
- Ah!
- What "tools"?

214
00:15:08,643 --> 00:15:09,797
Tools is an ugly word!

215
00:15:09,798 --> 00:15:11,814
Tools, tools, instruments, tools, tools ...

216
00:15:11,815 --> 00:15:14,333
It is a colloquial expression that never has and
wants to use.

217
00:15:14,334 --> 00:15:16,855
Then as you say Gainii
men?

218
00:15:16,856 --> 00:15:20,299
I do not mean no man's chickens,
I grew up on farms.

219
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:24,467
- My roommate is a frisky!
- I am crazy?

220
00:15:24,468 --> 00:15:27,589
- How did you get into this school?
- I slept with the registration agent.

221
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:31,134
- That is disgusting.
- I know, I think he had irritation.

222
00:15:31,815 --> 00:15:33,702
- Where you going?
- Out.

223
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:38,718
Priscilly Hey, want to live a second?

224
00:15:39,424 --> 00:15:42,892
I made it off with one motion,
Imagine what they can do with the whole hand.

225
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:47,053
I got the f, on C and on k, all I
must be u!

226
00:15:49,487 --> 00:15:52,843
I will be in port the ship, I will go before
to Scotland crap out of me.

227
00:15:56,201 --> 00:15:58,026
I think I started it a
bring to the floor.

228
00:16:02,366 --> 00:16:05,100
Ready for party players?
Puicuþele crazy one will be there.

229
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:07,527
I can not go, I have a test tomorrow.

230
00:16:07,528 --> 00:16:09,355
I will stay to learn.

231
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:16,813
Just kidding. In fact the test does not,
is a big one really.

232
00:16:18,036 --> 00:16:20,067
What ashtray trick.

233
00:16:20,068 --> 00:16:22,350
I found another, this is
that and my cuþa.

234
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,066
You just have to sit here and you
you read?

235
00:16:26,067 --> 00:16:31,183
It will be a fun party, come on,
something we drink, we dance.

236
00:16:32,065 --> 00:16:34,903
- Come play with us.
- Play with some guys.

237
00:16:34,904 --> 00:16:37,055
Kiss someone's name that do not know are.

238
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:38,617
We have to learn.

239
00:16:41,412 --> 00:16:44,054
Want to see picture of someone who
he has social life?

240
00:16:44,685 --> 00:16:49,303
If I so see, I see a
teenage priorities straight.

241
00:16:49,304 --> 00:16:51,528
Jesus, no wonder
nobody likes you.

242
00:16:51,837 --> 00:16:54,275
That is not true, everyone
I like it.

243
00:16:54,276 --> 00:16:57,553
Sure, because everyone feels so
comfortable around you.

244
00:16:58,395 --> 00:17:01,665
Shit, is as if you exit with a
nun for less fun.

245
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:03,882
To go less and lamalelor.

246
00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:09,967
Do you go Already longing.

247
00:17:11,585 --> 00:17:13,261
Think you!

248
00:17:18,432 --> 00:17:23,358
Hi Brad, My roommate
left the city in a kind of festival.

249
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:26,095
Why not answer the phone?

250
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,767
However, now told me that no one
I do not like.

251
00:17:30,263 --> 00:17:33,084
How can anyone not me
like, not so?

252
00:17:36,968 --> 00:17:39,749
Anyway, my stick,
miss you.

253
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,269
Call me when you receive the message.

254
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:03,248
- What studiaþi you two?
- I get my NBA.

255
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:06,541
Yes, you know the difference between
regression and depression?

256
00:18:06,999 --> 00:18:09,255
To work is a depression,
not you? So it is.

257
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:10,673
But you, what study?

258
00:18:10,674 --> 00:18:13,293
I study the genetics, because I hope
to save lives someday.

259
00:18:13,294 --> 00:18:16,959
You know, identifying genes and the origin
Their important work, right?

260
00:18:17,234 --> 00:18:19,082
You two should already be very
proud of you.

261
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,022
Now take a look at the camera and say that
you are some dirty whores.

262
00:18:21,023 --> 00:18:22,971
I'm a dirty slut.

263
00:18:22,972 --> 00:18:24,561
They all go crazy when you will see.

264
00:18:25,055 --> 00:18:28,507
Now you go arãtaþi butts,
queue is there. Okay?

267
00:18:44,801 --> 00:18:48,519
No one seems interested now
I want some heavy þâþe.

268
00:18:48,521 --> 00:18:50,832

277
00:19:07,632 --> 00:19:09,296

281
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:18,325
Why do not you bring your fucking
the draft with þâþele?

282
00:19:18,326 --> 00:19:21,147
- I brought the box.
- Okay, uses a mine.

283
00:19:21,148 --> 00:19:23,516
Fuck the box, give me the plan anyway.

Basic ã knew I know that the planet
is only 5,000 years.

287
00:19:44,112 --> 00:19:47,119
What nonsense is this, so I
Keep on tâmpiþii

288
00:19:47,121 --> 00:19:49,025
ã knew not tell you to your

289
00:19:49,026 --> 00:19:51,509
Because they are amazing, I can ...

290
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:57,688
It's ok, thank newcomers.

291
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:02,935
It is a good doctor.

292
00:20:11,813 --> 00:20:13,208
I can not believe you're here.

293
00:20:13,209 --> 00:20:17,739
How you can support this hideous music,
I can not sleep, can not think.

294
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:21,858
Calm down, give the body
it a chance.

295
00:20:21,859 --> 00:20:25,367
- And Nattaly, my place is here.

296

- Mary Margaret always said ...
- It takes a hell Mary Margaret.

298
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:35,920
Just kidding, just wait five minutes,
takes only one drink.

299
00:20:35,921 --> 00:20:37,057
Absolutely not.

300
00:20:37,058 --> 00:20:39,960
If you do not want to wait, we can move
party at home.

301
00:20:39,961 --> 00:20:42,270
- Hey, want to come to us ...
- Okay, okay.

302
00:20:42,271 --> 00:20:46,192
Okay, I'll stay, but only
for five minutes.

303
00:20:49,092 --> 00:20:51,392
Here, take some jelly.

304
00:20:54,783 --> 00:20:57,454
My mother did this house is good.

305
00:20:58,224 --> 00:21:00,813

322
00:24:12,459 --> 00:24:16,740
You Rock, withdraw everything I said

323
00:24:17,909 --> 00:24:21,193
- Please, no yells.
- Stirsy, you are my new hero.

324
00:24:21,194 --> 00:24:22,832
What are you talking?

325
00:24:23,009 --> 00:24:26,203
Is that your bra hanging in
outside the house of culture?

326
00:24:26,204 --> 00:24:28,292
- What?
- Jokes are even not you remember?

327
00:24:28,293 --> 00:24:30,331
What you remember, all I remember
is that we danced.

328
00:24:30,732 --> 00:24:32,236
Ouch!

329
00:24:34,613 --> 00:24:36,295
Nataly, what I did

330
00:24:36,619 --> 00:24:42,592
You become a little wild, that is,

331
00:24:42,593 --> 00:24:45,032
Even for my standards,

00:24:45,033 --> 00:24:48,289
- And did not you stop?
- You are jokes, fun and you at once.

333

It was the most hard working guys from
Do you devote a range House new religion.

334
00:24:55,168 --> 00:24:59,207
I swear I knew that it may raise

337
00:25:07,896 --> 00:25:09,977
Do not understand, all I got

338
00:25:09,978 --> 00:25:13,474

00:25:30,535 --> 00:25:35,949
- No, no, no, no!
- Priscilla, come on, you did something stupid.

343
00:25:36,974 --> 00:25:38,573
Welcome to the human race.

344
00:25:39,982 --> 00:25:43,089
If my parents see this box,
I will kill you.

345
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:47,024
If "Cann Hurry Love" find out about it
I will withdraw membership.

346
00:25:47,025 --> 00:25:48,864
I'll be thrown out of college.

347
00:25:49,115 --> 00:25:50,498
What will I do afterwards?

348
00:25:51,097 --> 00:25:53,333
Can one ever to do
adult movie.

349
00:25:53,334 --> 00:25:57,986
I'm your pal only 5 weeks and
I turned into a porn star.

350
00:25:57,987 --> 00:26:01,135
Slowly, yet are not porn star.

351
00:26:01,136 --> 00:26:03,752
At least not prior to your
do first demo.

352
00:26:06,641 --> 00:26:07,939
Get off me!

353
00:26:14,623 --> 00:26:16,614
Damn, are more impaired
than you look.

354
00:26:16,615 --> 00:26:18,595
It's your fault!

355
00:26:18,596 --> 00:26:19,856
My fault, how?

356
00:26:19,857 --> 00:26:25,024
How? You are the one who insisted to remain
the party, thou hast drunk.

357
00:26:25,025 --> 00:26:28,356
Yes, but I thought that you ...
so this is not my fault!

358
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:34,468
Great, finally I get to light and
Now I am "persona ogratan.

359
00:26:34,469 --> 00:26:36,785
That means people with cheese.

360
00:26:38,852 --> 00:26:40,310
My life is ruined.

361
00:26:40,311 --> 00:26:43,382
I did some researches
About Curtzman.

362
00:26:43,383 --> 00:26:46,410
It is the way to Detroit for
October Fest as we speak.

363
00:26:46,411 --> 00:26:47,968
All you have to do is it
find Curtzman

364
00:26:47,969 --> 00:26:49,557
and to persuade him to give us
shooting back.

365
00:26:49,558 --> 00:26:52,048
What would be Mary Margaret, what would
is Mary Margaret.

366
00:26:52,049 --> 00:26:54,626
We can pay with credit card
My father's journey

367
00:26:54,627 --> 00:26:55,885
and we will be there before
sunset.

368
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,791
You can not go, I meditation tomorrow.

369
00:26:58,792 --> 00:27:02,111
So you will not have to be a porn star and me
can save the membership.

370
00:27:02,112 --> 00:27:03,734
Certainly.

371
00:27:03,735 --> 00:27:07,011
Where we go, I will find
on cheliosul Ala

372
00:27:07,012 --> 00:27:09,340
and I will look in your eyes and I will say:
Mr

373
00:27:09,341 --> 00:27:14,115
are a teenager who horribly wrong
and ask that tape back now.

374
00:27:14,116 --> 00:27:15,548
It is a long and sharp.

375
00:27:15,549 --> 00:27:18,589
Not define me, we go to
intimitãþii doors,

376
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:19,632
will travel to the center of the abyss

377
00:27:19,633 --> 00:27:24,386
and we find that shooting or my name
is Priscilla White.

378
00:27:25,081 --> 00:27:27,120
This is a virgin angry.

379
00:27:32,743 --> 00:27:35,560
Dude, give up, I catch a reception
the phone here,

380
00:27:35,561 --> 00:27:37,481

381
00:27:42,967 --> 00:27:46,464
Kevin, Hi, Eileen, Do you bring May

382
00:27:46,837 --> 00:27:48,855
Your girlfriend.

383
00:27:52,763 --> 00:27:54,610
Hi, I'm still me.

384
00:27:55,211 --> 00:27:59,803
They passed around ... 5 minutes.

385
00:28:02,968 --> 00:28:07,499
I forgot to tell you I love the message
So previously, I love you.

386
00:28:11,517 --> 00:28:15,334
And I remembered, if you only look at other
pair of breasts

387
00:28:15,336 --> 00:28:18,911
Do you you laugh boa and hairy and they send them
by mail mother know.

388
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:25,193
I can not hear it.

389
00:28:25,194 --> 00:28:28,070
- Oh, let him on it.
- You fuck with me, do you?

390
00:28:53,028 --> 00:28:54,934
Falsaþi!

391
00:29:01,202 --> 00:29:03,191
May tãceþi.

392
00:29:08,831 --> 00:29:10,874
I'll shot the hell up!

393
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:14,142
This is my song and the Brad.

394
00:29:14,143 --> 00:29:16,074
I shall miss him so.

395
00:29:25,868 --> 00:29:28,993
October Fest, I realize that
will happen here.

396
00:29:28,994 --> 00:29:30,921
I know, not great?

397
00:29:31,884 --> 00:29:33,366
You have room?

398
00:29:34,317 --> 00:29:37,810
- The 27 plus costs.
- Eileen.

399
00:29:40,485 --> 00:29:41,812
Great.

400
00:29:46,795 --> 00:29:47,885
What is that?

401
00:29:48,586 --> 00:29:50,326
Someone left cart
room service out.

402
00:29:50,327 --> 00:29:53,062
- It is half empty.
- The fact is half full.

403
00:29:53,668 --> 00:29:54,658
Beer?

404
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:57,526
No, no, no, I have come here and find
on Curtzman did not happen.

405
00:29:57,527 --> 00:30:00,012
We will sleep with everybody, we begin
early morning.

406
00:30:00,013 --> 00:30:04,796

408
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:28,445

409
00:30:28,446 --> 00:30:29,706
in the same room,

410
00:30:29,707 --> 00:30:32,820
No, but see how you forget about me when I
prepare for bed at night.

411
00:30:32,821 --> 00:30:36,551
The way I look ... yes, part of you and
Drawing on pajamas

Can I ask you something?
Fantazii you ever?

414
00:30:42,753 --> 00:30:44,999
- What?
- You know you, sexual fantasies?

415
00:30:45,816 --> 00:30:48,533
Of course you have, you do not believe

416
00:30:48,534 --> 00:30:50,361
- Tell me one.

417
00:30:50,362 --> 00:30:53,860
Come on, boys sleep

418
00:30:55,506 --> 00:30:57,367
Promiþi you not laugh?

419
00:30:57,368 --> 00:30:59,002
Honestly.

420
00:31:00,137 --> 00:31:04,154
Okay, so start at my wedding.

421
00:31:05,544 --> 00:31:08,206
I come to church even for lunch.

422
00:31:08,207 --> 00:31:11,033
Bride and her family arrive at 12.30
photo

423
00:31:11,034 --> 00:31:13,300
because the bride has lost much
while dressing himself.

424
00:31:13,392 --> 00:31:15,798
Complete preparations to 2.45
for party

may start at 3.

426
00:31:19,048 --> 00:31:22,514

Dinner at 5.30, cutting the cake at 6.35.

429
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:34,923
We leave the reception exactly 8 and
we take a limo to the hotel.

430
00:31:34,924 --> 00:31:40,403
We arrive at around 8.25, 20
minutes to get up and you unpack.

431
00:31:41,764 --> 00:31:47,369

00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,733
- A do?
- You know you, make love.

433
00:31:50,734 --> 00:31:53,197
That is great your sexual fantasy?

434
00:31:53,198 --> 00:31:56,342
You lose your virginity to 8.45
nunþii the night?

435
00:31:56,343 --> 00:31:59,316
Plus minus 10 minute
depending on traffic.

436
00:31:59,445 --> 00:32:03,569
This gives a new understand
phrase "ano-sex".

437
00:32:04,576 --> 00:32:05,794
Okay, your turn.

438
00:32:05,795 --> 00:32:08,170
First is a pony.

439
00:32:09,162 --> 00:32:12,636
Oh, kidding, Jesus Priscilla,
not a total pervert.

440
00:32:12,637 --> 00:32:14,712
You do not ever take anything seriously?

441
00:32:14,713 --> 00:32:17,356
Life is not so far from
serious as you think it is.

442
00:32:17,357 --> 00:32:21,339
You are a player, I am libertine,
a free spirit.

443
00:32:22,064 --> 00:32:25,811
I do not want to end the ESC in substrates,
married high school friend.

444
00:32:25,812 --> 00:32:29,472
Wondering how my life would be
when lock-n traffic in my SUV,

445
00:32:29,473 --> 00:32:31,135
and I'm heading towards a dead
more boring

446
00:32:31,136 --> 00:32:32,178
than has ever been my life.

447
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:36,369
I never imagined that
you'm so afraid.

448
00:32:36,778 --> 00:32:38,898
I am, why I'm afraid the one thousand
this earth?

449
00:32:39,451 --> 00:32:41,941
- Maturing.
- Maturing is for fags.

450
00:32:42,841 --> 00:32:45,687
We take in Taiwan, as always do.
Wait a second, will you?

451
00:32:46,789 --> 00:32:49,276
Dulceaþo Hi, you got the package?

452
00:32:50,153 --> 00:32:54,212
Exactly, exactly, yes, the instructions for

453
00:32:54,213 --> 00:32:55,972
Well, try not to lose
this time.

454
00:32:55,973 --> 00:32:57,775
Daddy loves you, wait a second.

455
00:32:57,776 --> 00:33:00,494
Hey, hey, I own you
elevator clovnule.

456
00:33:00,495 --> 00:33:01,612
Yes, sorry.

457
00:33:02,593 --> 00:33:04,062
Daddy must close
and loves you.

458
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:22,303
You late!

459
00:33:23,052 --> 00:33:27,064
Natalie I'll take the east side of
street, you guys take on the Western one.

460
00:33:27,065 --> 00:33:29,723
If someone sees Curtyman
We will call on cell.

461
00:33:29,724 --> 00:33:32,707
If you do not meet up to the end
Today we meet here tonight.

462
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:39,415
You somehow heard what I spoke
me and Natalie last night?

463
00:33:39,416 --> 00:33:41,283
I do not, I fell asleep when
when I touched the pillow.

464
00:33:42,047 --> 00:33:43,531
And I immediately.

465
00:33:43,992 --> 00:33:45,560
Well.

466
00:33:45,561 --> 00:33:47,911
Well, if you do not see him until then,
we meet here tonight.

467
00:33:47,912 --> 00:33:50,430
- Yes!
- At 8.45?

468
00:33:55,038 --> 00:33:57,627
- Not too exaggerated.
- What do you mean.

469
00:33:57,628 --> 00:34:01,905
Two people link to each other in a
person, you know what I mean?

470
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:04,480
You know, everyone, everyone
served.

471
00:34:04,481 --> 00:34:07,785
- No one to find him and never a.
- Calm down.

472
00:34:07,786 --> 00:34:12,637
Maybe you should ask ... hey do you
Pipiþele saw a guy crazy?

473
00:34:12,638 --> 00:34:14,091
- What?
- Pipiþele a crazy.

474
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:17,324
No, no, no.

475
00:34:17,325 --> 00:34:20,081
All right, you need less
self-esteem.

476
00:34:20,082 --> 00:34:23,884
Look a free entry ticket
wonderful organization "Can not Hurry in love".

477
00:34:25,865 --> 00:34:29,216
Dude, like something had to search for
Curtzman not to buy cookies.

478
00:34:29,217 --> 00:34:31,040
But I was looking for Curtzman.

479
00:34:31,041 --> 00:34:34,861
I love you, love you.

480
00:34:34,862 --> 00:34:36,563
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

481
00:34:37,615 --> 00:34:41,708
- How you do?
- Literally 2 minutes ago I spoke.

482
00:34:41,709 --> 00:34:43,674
- Kevin!
- Not that he and like to talk ...

483
00:34:43,675 --> 00:34:45,697
- This is aggressive behavior ...
- No!

484
00:34:45,698 --> 00:34:50,161
If you think I will not say anything
Dr. Sheryn, wrong are wrong sir.

485
00:34:50,747 --> 00:34:54,125
Well, you must exchange a banknote,
can call you afterwards?

486
00:34:54,126 --> 00:34:55,458
But soon.

487
00:34:58,322 --> 00:35:01,318
Bon appétit.

488
00:35:02,128 --> 00:35:06,469
So I thought we should go
to him and to say, one is amazing.

489
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:09,509
We went to a hockey game,
hockey you know are so incredible.

490
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:12,388
There are men come to you
very well.

491
00:35:12,389 --> 00:35:15,591
So let me deal with beliefs,
can do whatever you want.

492
00:35:15,592 --> 00:35:19,380
- Come to ask here.
- I do not get here!

493
00:35:19,381 --> 00:35:21,965
That is exactly where it
Curtzman could go.

494
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:26,191
- No!
- Well, we go to church to ask.

495
00:35:33,675 --> 00:35:35,817
Oh Lord where I put.

496
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:40,030
It's good, it is as if you
be in a dressing room.

497
00:35:40,031 --> 00:35:42,164
Yes, where prostitutes walk.

498
00:35:42,689 --> 00:35:44,515
Sit down, you go to ask whether
saw someone.

499
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:47,296
Do not touch anything,
is a factor of infections.

500
00:36:29,388 --> 00:36:31,017
Natally?

501
00:36:40,009 --> 00:36:41,780
Priscilla come here.

502
00:36:49,054 --> 00:36:52,477
You got wrong person, think that is
a misunderstanding.

503
00:36:52,479 --> 00:36:54,962
No person ... appropriate.

504
00:36:55,291 --> 00:36:56,671
Relax!

505
00:37:01,864 --> 00:37:06,696
Lick it, lick it, lick it, lick it.

506
00:37:52,466 --> 00:37:54,929
Welcome to the objective.

507
00:38:01,041 --> 00:38:03,133
He and his see some dosuri.

508
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:07,906
Priscilla White 47% pure!

509
00:38:09,975 --> 00:38:13,492
- Cceii well spent there.
- They treated me like a piece of meat.

510
00:38:13,493 --> 00:38:16,847
- A sex object.
- I can not blame that tastes good.

511
00:38:16,848 --> 00:38:19,912
Natalie, they do not complements,
not realize

512
00:38:19,913 --> 00:38:22,843
that men do this to intimidate
and to intimidate women?

513
00:38:22,844 --> 00:38:24,749
Well, I never thought so,

514
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:27,886
I feel oppressed but must
are grateful he had a nice ass.

515
00:38:27,887 --> 00:38:30,977
Congratulations, you just turned women
40 years ago.

516
00:38:30,979 --> 00:38:33,330
Lord, I spent all day
trying to help.

517
00:38:33,331 --> 00:38:36,283
Help me? Throughout my future
is in danger

518
00:38:36,284 --> 00:38:38,015
and all you do is to
you pay a guy

519
00:38:38,016 --> 00:38:40,843
clopoþelul put me in front and
to laugh at me.

520
00:38:40,844 --> 00:38:45,836
Do not laugh at yourself, but if you want to
stay and to feel offended, you have only.

521
00:38:45,837 --> 00:38:47,908
- I will have fun!
- Okay.

522
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:49,280
Very good.

523
00:38:57,990 --> 00:39:00,476
- Remember it is coming.
- In Detroit at 6.30.

524
00:39:00,522 --> 00:39:04,097
Domu Curtzman ...
"Pipiþele a crazy"!

525
00:39:11,611 --> 00:39:12,864
That was great, ladies.

526
00:39:13,694 --> 00:39:15,104
But 35 years ago.

527
00:39:16,167 --> 00:39:18,875
I'll watch some porn for me
delete it from the brain,

528
00:39:18,876 --> 00:39:20,236
and Do you suggest to do and so do you.

529
00:39:23,967 --> 00:39:26,217
Hi my stick, I am.

530
00:39:26,774 --> 00:39:28,567
I still come voicemail.

531
00:39:30,664 --> 00:39:34,214
I miss you, call me when
you receive the message.

532
00:39:43,928 --> 00:39:46,540
- Hello?
- Hi, Mom I am.

533
00:39:46,541 --> 00:39:49,445
Harold raised is Priscilla.

534
00:39:49,446 --> 00:39:51,337
- What?
- Priscilla.

535
00:39:52,101 --> 00:39:54,724
Priscilla, sweetheart, what do
my baby?

536
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:57,061
They are great, really great.

537
00:39:57,062 --> 00:39:59,713
Listen, I have a weird question.

538
00:39:59,714 --> 00:40:01,474
Tell me that you had
sexual tendencies.

539
00:40:01,475 --> 00:40:04,033
Of course that never had
sexual tendencies.

540
00:40:04,034 --> 00:40:06,664
No, folks, I had
sexual tendencies.

541
00:40:09,038 --> 00:40:11,215
I only have about a kind of ...

542
00:40:11,216 --> 00:40:16,120
I do not know what would happen if it has and
May have membership?

543
00:40:16,121 --> 00:40:19,541
Well, if you've never had membership of
able to go home.

544
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:23,002
You get your old job back and you study
here to Richd cultural College.

545
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:26,030
We could restore the club
Saturday night movies.

546
00:40:26,031 --> 00:40:29,959
- There was nothing bad happened, do you?
- No, nothing bad happened.

547
00:40:30,472 --> 00:40:33,174
Nothing is bad but
I gotta go.

548
00:40:33,175 --> 00:40:35,939
I went to a study group,
love you.

549
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:38,942
- And we love you.
- We are pretty disappointed.

550
00:40:54,727 --> 00:40:56,199
Hi.

551
00:40:59,993 --> 00:41:01,509
You complained before?

552
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:03,747
No, do not complain.

553
00:41:03,748 --> 00:41:07,216
You do not cry, which is kind of right?

554
00:41:07,217 --> 00:41:09,642
My parents will disown me.

555
00:41:10,461 --> 00:41:15,746
And after years of abstinenþã will be
categorized as a slut.

556
00:41:17,169 --> 00:41:20,970
- Maybe this is a good thing.
- To be considered slut is good?

557
00:41:20,971 --> 00:41:25,019
No, a new beginning, a fresh start,
change.

558
00:41:26,436 --> 00:41:31,427
Take, chocolate treats everything.

559
00:41:33,312 --> 00:41:35,188
I got it from Chuck and Kevin.

560
00:41:44,201 --> 00:41:45,860
It is really good.

561
00:41:45,862 --> 00:41:49,209
Do not you worry, we will find
on Curtyman.

562
00:41:49,891 --> 00:41:54,897
- And if we give the tape?
- Then I would make life a hell!

563
00:41:55,031 --> 00:41:57,643
And I will destroy everything you love.

564
00:41:57,644 --> 00:42:00,389
And I will torture you until I
begging to kill him,

565
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:01,976
just to get him out of misery
in which it is located.

566
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:05,699
- While you do that for me?
- Of course.

567
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:08,226
- That some friends do for others.
- Yes.

568
00:42:08,808 --> 00:42:12,123
I think are really
întortocheaþi friends.

569
00:42:16,948 --> 00:42:18,192
Do not be ridiculous.

570
00:42:40,627 --> 00:42:43,464
Yes, dear, keep it down,
keep it down honey.

571
00:43:08,099 --> 00:43:13,514
Excuse me, you know where
Room 396?

572
00:43:13,515 --> 00:43:15,699
Room 396 ...

573
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:18,608
That should be near 394.

574
00:43:18,891 --> 00:43:22,337
And across from 395.

575
00:43:23,797 --> 00:43:25,237
Usually go in order.

576
00:43:25,933 --> 00:43:29,719
At least the experience of other
hotels where we stayed.

577
00:43:33,632 --> 00:43:35,223
This could be different.

578
00:43:35,937 --> 00:43:37,520
But why?

579
00:43:40,271 --> 00:43:42,037
That is the question.

580
00:43:44,819 --> 00:43:46,416
I am here for you.

581
00:43:48,244 --> 00:43:50,533
- Thank you.
- Sure.

582
00:44:45,396 --> 00:44:46,804
Natalie!

583
00:44:46,805 --> 00:44:49,370
I really need to get stuff
that with you in bed.

584
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:56,574
Come on, do not hound me with it.

585
00:45:01,118 --> 00:45:05,122
Natalie, if you do not throw stuff
that out, I will.

586
00:45:54,364 --> 00:45:55,722
I fell in love.

587
00:45:55,723 --> 00:45:58,845
Priscilla White 25% pure.

588
00:46:01,938 --> 00:46:04,540
- You go to hell.
- Stop all say that.

589
00:46:04,541 --> 00:46:08,439
- So I did a kind of a manual.
- I never did anyone needlework.

590
00:46:08,755 --> 00:46:10,629
I have worked on the rope.

591
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:14,714
- How do you call this, a bank robbery?
- I do not even know how it happened.

592
00:46:16,043 --> 00:46:17,768
I ate there anything?

593
00:46:17,769 --> 00:46:19,935
Yes, bruneþica.

594
00:46:19,936 --> 00:46:22,111
Unfortunately Chuck and Kevin
purchased a

595
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:23,955
the less ordinary
That the baker.

596
00:46:23,956 --> 00:46:25,213
Sorry.

597
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:27,988
Eat something, you feel better.

598
00:46:28,338 --> 00:46:30,443
I feel better? I feel better.

599
00:46:30,937 --> 00:46:34,820
I was in front with înþepatã duda,
I was drugged with illegal substances,

600
00:46:34,821 --> 00:46:37,645
and now I did a type
a manual.

601
00:46:37,646 --> 00:46:40,160
One more reason my new
life degraded

602
00:46:40,162 --> 00:46:42,010
which can have a festive time
I will rot in hell

603
00:46:42,011 --> 00:46:45,699
since I do not have membership,
because I removed a porn tape.

604
00:46:46,462 --> 00:46:49,208
- Mary Margaret, forgive me.
- Shut up!

605
00:46:49,209 --> 00:46:50,662
I keep quiet? You shut up!

606
00:46:50,663 --> 00:46:52,387
No, because there he shut up there.

607
00:46:53,256 --> 00:46:55,872
God, that is,
what you say.

608
00:46:55,873 --> 00:46:58,241
You have not lost at all until now
when you saw, do you?

609
00:46:58,491 --> 00:46:59,461
No!

610
00:46:59,669 --> 00:47:01,957
You know exactly what you need to tell.

611
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:04,385
- Yes, I know.
- Yes, now go.

612
00:47:04,386 --> 00:47:06,216
- We'll be right behind you.
- All right.

613
00:47:08,652 --> 00:47:12,877
Stereotype psychological, sexual, emotional
of women who win win when ...

614
00:47:12,878 --> 00:47:15,906
It is when the doctor says that
is a girl. Not correct.

615
00:47:16,146 --> 00:47:19,259
Men can download off their shirts,
can go swimming.

616
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:20,955
Q and can wash car,
can play volleyball,

617
00:47:20,956 --> 00:47:23,151
But see two women get to him and
off bras

618
00:47:23,152 --> 00:47:24,954
like to play volleyball, men download
lose their minds.

619
00:47:27,488 --> 00:47:29,124
S not only breast and times.

620
00:47:31,564 --> 00:47:33,800
Everyone has breasts,
what's the big problem.

621
00:47:33,801 --> 00:47:36,634
In Europe we just laugh,
I say: I just breasts.

622
00:47:36,635 --> 00:47:38,642
Say: I'm just some didi,
what's the problem.

623
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:41,578
I just didi, that's the problem.

624
00:47:41,579 --> 00:47:44,207
What happened with this
culture is ridiculous.

625
00:47:44,208 --> 00:47:45,664
You know, you two should be
arãtaþi to them.

626
00:47:46,273 --> 00:47:49,201
Want to see them showing them?

627
00:47:51,337 --> 00:47:55,009
Curtzman excuse me sir, are a
Teenagers who bitterly wrong.

628
00:47:55,010 --> 00:47:57,109
If you have a tape, I hold a
for you,

629
00:47:57,110 --> 00:47:59,736
send it to us at the office and if we
uses will give you a shirt.

630
00:47:59,737 --> 00:48:02,591
I have your video now
few nights at the College of Pennington.

631
00:48:02,867 --> 00:48:06,256
Open your coat, get your side
top, maybe it is my memory.

632
00:48:06,257 --> 00:48:09,870
No, please, please, I really need
shots that you have done with me.

633
00:48:09,871 --> 00:48:12,274
My whole future depends on it.

634
00:48:12,865 --> 00:48:15,896
Look, if I had one U.S. dollars from
Every girl who said that I would rich.

635
00:48:15,897 --> 00:48:18,249
But you already are rich, then
I would think richer.

636
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:21,041
Curtzman Mr., Mrs. White did the
signed any act of distribution,

637
00:48:21,042 --> 00:48:23,514
So we have reason to release actions
legal action against you.

638
00:48:23,515 --> 00:48:24,435
You're a lawyer?

639
00:48:24,436 --> 00:48:27,419
I Prelog, but I thought you
Instead history book.

640
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:29,943
Have been the "Gallery Bouzard"
in Paris?

641
00:48:29,944 --> 00:48:32,659
It is wonderful, a semester overseas
Think only you.

642
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:35,505
- Oh, sounds wonderful.
- Try to expose a point here, Kevin.

643
00:48:35,639 --> 00:48:38,447
Your corporation
is founded

644
00:48:38,448 --> 00:48:40,772
on Indian tribal land
any chance?

645
00:48:40,773 --> 00:48:42,252
No!

646
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:46,827
What matters, of more videos
many girls

647
00:48:46,828 --> 00:48:49,747
So it is, some people would
says an empire.

648
00:48:50,038 --> 00:48:51,828
Look, there is nothing to your
be ashamed,

649
00:48:51,829 --> 00:48:53,719
Be proud of your body that
God gave him.

650
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:57,046
20 years from now you will be able to

There have been 1000 or 1000 individual breast
form of pairs of breasts.

671
00:50:26,171 --> 00:50:28,572

672
00:50:28,573 --> 00:50:29,892

Would you like guys salivating after you

00:51:13,835 --> 00:51:15,255
Let's go.

Oh, take take a look, Curtzman of procreation.

Girls squirrel, how it works

694
00:51:58,467 --> 00:52:00,653
Sister in the hole of a house.

695
00:52:00,654 --> 00:52:03,767
So let me understand, you not liked
puicuþele any of those?

696
00:52:04,494 --> 00:52:06,262
A girl said it was a little
too open hair.

697
00:52:06,263 --> 00:52:07,622
I thought it was less nice.

698
00:52:07,919 --> 00:52:09,707
Too open hair?

699
00:52:09,964 --> 00:52:12,705
I refer to breasts, do not you have liked
none of those breasts?

I see breasts every day, you know.

701
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:15,715
They are all as one together.

702
00:52:16,430 --> 00:52:18,865
Maybe you would like it if I
shoot men.

Yes, it would be ...

00:52:19,914 --> 00:52:21,553
Maybe we should start like

714
00:52:49,475 --> 00:52:50,848

715
00:52:50,849 --> 00:52:53,489

Dumneze ... Brad!

725
00:53:53,524 --> 00:53:54,811
Brad!

726
00:54:01,114 --> 00:54:02,644
Where did it go?

727
00:54:03,033 --> 00:54:04,379
Brad!

728
00:54:15,121 --> 00:54:17,261
- Priscilla!
- Brad!

729
00:54:19,938 --> 00:54:21,577
Mary Margaret!

730
00:54:21,578 --> 00:54:24,040
Priscilla is not what it seems.

731
00:54:24,041 --> 00:54:25,290
Can you explain your.

732
00:54:25,648 --> 00:54:29,147
You were my mentor, I have relied
you all your life.

733
00:54:29,148 --> 00:54:32,834
You truly believe that is a
virgin innocent?

734
00:54:33,010 --> 00:54:36,736
God, what's going on?

735
00:54:37,749 --> 00:54:39,943
God you thought!

736
00:54:46,138 --> 00:54:51,482
Well ... successful with all the work
that of Virginia.

737
00:54:51,483 --> 00:54:52,618
I can not believe.

738
00:54:54,019 --> 00:54:55,632
Pris ... Priscilla wait!

739
00:54:55,819 --> 00:54:57,561
You're still in me.

740
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:06,865
I need a huricane, please,
largest that I have.

741
00:55:08,007 --> 00:55:11,183
My friend me wrong right now.

742
00:55:11,184 --> 00:55:14,562
The alley, with Mary Margaret
is my model.

743
00:55:14,563 --> 00:55:16,572
That is was my model.

744
00:55:23,415 --> 00:55:24,886
You are going to pay for that?

745
00:55:30,796 --> 00:55:33,106
Take that, we no longer need it.

746
00:55:35,262 --> 00:55:37,260
Priscilla, this is the fifth message.

747
00:55:37,261 --> 00:55:40,874
Listen, I lost Curtzman,
where are you, call me?

748
00:55:41,668 --> 00:55:44,903
- Any luck?
- No, his phone is off.

749
00:55:45,127 --> 00:55:48,987
What to do, you start to call the hospital
or the convention of chastity?

750
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:52,069
I must be on the road since
right now, stay still.

751
00:56:19,690 --> 00:56:22,200
- What happened to you?
- They lied.

752
00:56:22,201 --> 00:56:24,492
- Who?
- Brad, Mary Margaret.

753
00:56:24,659 --> 00:56:27,744
During this time everywhere
behind me.

754
00:56:27,745 --> 00:56:31,903
Sex alley, crazy, sweaty
and full of desire.

755
00:56:31,904 --> 00:56:34,912
All Support Mary Margaret
is a lie.

756
00:56:34,913 --> 00:56:37,369
Which means that "Can Hurry Love"
is a lie,

757
00:56:37,370 --> 00:56:39,433
which means that I am a joke.

758
00:56:39,977 --> 00:56:42,485
I can not believe I
hold for him.

759
00:56:48,262 --> 00:56:50,135
Let's do it.

760
00:56:50,136 --> 00:56:53,532
- Right now!
- Priscilla, are you?

761
00:56:57,037 --> 00:57:02,600
- Priss, wait just a second.
- What do you mean, wait a second.

762
00:57:02,601 --> 00:57:07,338
I thought just wait to do it with me
but you have to you, that is me.

763
00:57:09,707 --> 00:57:11,157
I wish, I would like.

764
00:57:16,989 --> 00:57:19,406
Trust me, I would like.

765
00:57:20,385 --> 00:57:24,709
But not so, you're drunk, mad, and i. ..

766
00:57:26,493 --> 00:57:29,068
... and do not want to be part of something
Why will not regret.

767
00:57:29,759 --> 00:57:31,467
Refuse?

768
00:57:33,432 --> 00:57:37,076
Sorry ... yes.

769
00:57:37,997 --> 00:57:42,039
Welcome ... there are millions of
boys înfometaþi

770
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:46,723
who would die to do it, and if you do not
want, you find someone who does.

771
00:57:46,724 --> 00:57:50,530
Just calm down a second, Made in
Manhattan will begin in a few moments

772
00:57:50,531 --> 00:57:53,543
Give him hell for Made in Manhattan,
are a virgin in Detroit

773
00:57:53,544 --> 00:57:55,204
and I'm going to change that!

774
00:57:55,733 --> 00:57:58,440
Priscilla White 10% pure.

775
00:58:00,765 --> 00:58:02,012
Priscilla wait.

776
00:58:04,447 --> 00:58:07,369
You saw Priscilla, we searched for
everywhere and never find one.

777
00:58:07,370 --> 00:58:10,278
He said that even it will shoot first
man that I see.

778
00:58:11,176 --> 00:58:12,274
What?

779
00:58:12,275 --> 00:58:14,598
It is something her friend would do
sex with Mary Margaret.

780
00:58:15,468 --> 00:58:18,974
Now we know what it is
Mary Margaret, and made.

781
00:58:18,975 --> 00:58:22,208
- Come on, gotta find one.
- Do not you stay here in case that is-returns.

782
00:58:22,209 --> 00:58:24,934
- But he needs me.
- This is a job for girls.

783
00:58:24,935 --> 00:58:26,283
And you do not want to be part and that.

784
00:58:28,376 --> 00:58:30,897
I'm going to stop someone
not to have sex

785
00:58:30,898 --> 00:58:34,293
but if you say that about someone
I will kill you.

786
00:58:34,987 --> 00:58:36,983
I swear to God!

787
00:58:38,134 --> 00:58:39,575
The cigarettes?

788
00:59:02,846 --> 00:59:04,550
Not my usual cargo.

789
00:59:09,277 --> 00:59:13,062
I know exactly what you are thinking and
answer is YES!

790
00:59:13,063 --> 00:59:15,969
If it is indeed a shirt
Kelvin Klein.

791
00:59:15,970 --> 00:59:18,228
My friend thought
Philip is a Lymm.

792
00:59:18,229 --> 00:59:20,564
Girl, I know a Kelvin Klein
when I see it.

793
00:59:21,542 --> 00:59:22,813
Trey's and IC.

794
00:59:33,098 --> 00:59:36,891
Look, all I want is
a night of sex

795
00:59:36,892 --> 00:59:42,477
without names, without questions, without promise,
just you and me hot sex.

796
00:59:42,478 --> 00:59:45,089
- I put?
- Yeah, baby.

797
00:59:45,090 --> 00:59:46,599
Great, let's go.

798
00:59:50,742 --> 00:59:53,223
Who the hell should I fuck
as to seduce be here?

799
01:00:02,266 --> 01:00:05,711
- Wait me.
- Leave me alone.

800
01:00:06,541 --> 01:00:08,848
- You can not do that.
- Why not?

801
01:00:08,849 --> 01:00:12,132
Because it is not good, you're mad,
are not thinking clearly.

802
01:00:12,133 --> 01:00:15,065
- You're so hypocritical one.
- I am a hypocrite?

803
01:00:15,390 --> 01:00:20,143
- And how about the sacred oath.
- I would like to not have it never did.

804
01:00:20,144 --> 01:00:24,636
- I take my own decisions.
- No, you react, do the same thing.

805
01:00:24,637 --> 01:00:28,002
Are mature now and are planned.

806
01:00:28,003 --> 01:00:30,197
Unlike some in which the
greatest treasure

807
01:00:30,198 --> 01:00:33,076
are some condoms and înþepenite
vibrating batteries.

808
01:00:34,493 --> 01:00:36,933
- I have a plan.
- Excuse me!

809
01:00:37,417 --> 01:00:40,752
- I have a plan.
- Really? In this must-hear.

810
01:00:43,899 --> 01:00:45,384
A and of me and I was thinking.

811
01:00:47,188 --> 01:00:50,320
- I want to become a photographer.
- Who, for Penthouse?

812
01:00:58,523 --> 01:01:01,238
- I'm sorry.
- Anyway.

813
01:01:06,858 --> 01:01:08,923
I am not a and a.

814
01:01:11,682 --> 01:01:13,625
All I mean is to
take time are.

815
01:01:14,398 --> 01:01:16,348
Think what you want
really.

816
01:01:17,997 --> 01:01:21,697
And if you want to fuck with each
boy in the city ...

817
01:01:22,156 --> 01:01:23,956
... I will sustain.

818
01:01:24,563 --> 01:01:26,016
Hell, even I will join.

819
01:01:28,097 --> 01:01:32,478
But if you decide to be a virgin on
all life is good and the and a.

820
01:01:33,020 --> 01:01:37,606
But make sure it's your choice.
Not your parents' choice, not mine

821
01:01:37,607 --> 01:01:39,743
and not the election of Mary Margaret.

822
01:01:41,551 --> 01:01:43,397
Your choice.

823
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:51,383
Well, come on.

824
01:01:52,515 --> 01:01:53,928
Let's go.

825
01:01:55,114 --> 01:01:58,133
If loses membership and go
home, I will lose.

826
01:01:58,134 --> 01:02:01,013
- I will lose before I got there.
- Why did you evaded?

827
01:02:01,624 --> 01:02:03,028
I had my reasons.

828
01:02:03,929 --> 01:02:04,864
Hi guys.

829
01:02:04,865 --> 01:02:07,047

831
01:02:09,255 --> 01:02:12,887
N-year man to leave him little guy
to ruin my life.

832
01:02:12,889 --> 01:02:16,736
October Fest is ready and starts Curtzman

833
01:02:16,737 --> 01:02:18,926
You tell me that easily and
simply forgot?

834
01:02:18,927 --> 01:02:22,687
I say that after all that
I want to give up last?

835
01:02:22,688 --> 01:02:24,851
Damn, this is what you want

836
01:02:24,852 --> 01:02:26,816
He said hell, I swear I just
Hell said.

837
01:02:26,958 --> 01:02:30,086
Damn, damn, damn, damn.

838
01:02:31,548 --> 01:02:33,309
God, our little girl
has matured.

839
01:02:33,975 --> 01:02:36,692
Wait, we know where it is right now.

840
01:02:37,259 --> 01:02:39,443

01:03:24,066 --> 01:03:28,005
Wait, now rub lips

<i> I love you. </ i></i>

855
01:03:45,340 --> 01:03:46,731
Do not answer!

856
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:50,097

We do not Pozam bottles.

01:04:40,274 --> 01:04:43,809
Until the main man in person,

says: Everyone feels

Come on, hand disinfectant, so,

The girl out.

878
01:05:21,408 --> 01:05:22,700
Mr Curtzman.

879
01:05:28,333 --> 01:05:32,110
I know believe in the freedom of women.
You said it yourself.

880
01:05:32,111 --> 01:05:34,266
Need to own control
our destinies.

881
01:05:34,793 --> 01:05:37,110
So allow me to control
mine.

882
01:05:37,327 --> 01:05:38,987
Please, give me that disk,

883
01:05:38,988 --> 01:05:41,704
that you can keep my membership and
to receive an education.

884
01:05:42,187 --> 01:05:45,694
Let me go in the future untainted
and to track my dreams.

885
01:05:48,512 --> 01:05:51,478
Nice speech.

886
01:05:51,479 --> 01:05:54,409
Seriously, I could lend him
sometimes.

887
01:05:54,410 --> 01:05:56,619
Spotless, I like that word.

888
01:05:57,217 --> 01:05:59,289
But you lose time, because
do not you will get.

889
01:05:59,290 --> 01:06:01,891
We will break the world tonight

890
01:06:06,312 --> 01:06:08,738
- Ten seconds Curtzman sir.
- Well, sit.

891
01:06:08,739 --> 01:06:11,480
Look, I know I gave a

892
01:06:12,088 --> 01:06:13,149
- But ...

893
01:06:16,396 --> 01:06:19,729
Hey, baby ... Why Looking here?

894
01:06:19,730 --> 01:06:24,045
Father, Priscilla made a mistake.
You do the right thing, do you?

895
01:06:24,046 --> 01:06:26,942
I should be here. This is not
a place for you.

896
01:06:27,071 --> 01:06:29,984
You profiþi of these girls and
This is not good.

897
01:06:29,985 --> 01:06:32,770
I do not bring those girls to do
nothing will not do.

898
01:06:33,570 --> 01:06:36,724
There are some rataþi, did not respect
self.

899
01:06:36,725 --> 01:06:38,251
- Listen to me.
- Excuse me.

900
01:06:38,252 --> 01:06:40,467
- Curtzman Sir, I ...
- Shut cãþea!

901
01:06:40,755 --> 01:06:43,792
Do not speak so to her.

902
01:06:43,793 --> 01:06:45,766
- Becca, listen to me.
- I have to listen.

903
01:06:45,767 --> 01:06:50,991
Hey, your father, you get back
home right now.

904
01:06:50,992 --> 01:06:52,940
And this will be the end, we
talk about

905
01:06:52,941 --> 01:06:55,319
and to not come to any show of
that ever.

906
01:06:55,320 --> 01:07:00,584
Look, I know I gave a bar,
but if i would have done it?

907
01:07:00,585 --> 01:07:02,227
It was more increased.

908
01:07:02,228 --> 01:07:04,132
She and breasts would look for
a free shirt.

909
01:07:10,153 --> 01:07:12,006
Becca, Becca!

910
01:07:13,473 --> 01:07:14,756
Becca?

911
01:07:14,757 --> 01:07:18,953
In 31 seconds you Curtzman Ed
be on the scene.

912
01:07:23,139 --> 01:07:25,333
You're a small cãþea.

913
01:07:26,421 --> 01:07:32,441
I'll take those records and tomorrow
this time will be worldwide.

914
01:07:33,715 --> 01:07:37,723
Young teenagers are waking up the morning
and Do you will see breasts.

915
01:07:37,724 --> 01:07:40,290
Oh, little ones boys in Taiwan.

916
01:07:40,548 --> 01:07:44,232
It will look at them and will be
that in their view.

917
01:07:50,254 --> 01:07:52,572
I will use as protection
screen.

918
01:07:52,574 --> 01:07:58,435
During this time I complained of miles,
but you cry for your mercy.

919
01:07:59,166 --> 01:08:05,218
Ed Curtzman come in 5, 4, 3, 2 ...

920
01:08:06,335 --> 01:08:11,471
Applause for my man, Ed Curtzman.

921
01:08:12,558 --> 01:08:16,695
I'd like to talk about it
with you, the tea can once.

922
01:08:16,696 --> 01:08:19,971
I have a room full of bitch and

"Pipiþele a crazy".

936
01:09:29,301 --> 01:09:31,049
None of you wants to-and
show breasts.

937
01:09:31,455 --> 01:09:33,136
Then you will receive shirts.

938
01:09:33,137 --> 01:09:37,694
Do not want to Be Famous?
"Pipiþele a crazy".

REVOKED

1013
01:15:21,620 --> 01:15:24,764
I just want to remind you that sex
is a wonderful thing.

1014
01:15:24,766 --> 01:15:27,282
It is something that frankly should be
to make it all the time.

1015
01:15:27,283 --> 01:15:31,584
Exactly, except persons who
you just have separated,

so I appeal to traveling
fields of their memories.

1018
01:15:37,184 --> 01:15:40,406
What seemed to others will be
a very bad idea.

1019
01:15:41,958 --> 01:15:44,950
The idea is that prevention
is a good thing.

1020
01:15:44,951 --> 01:15:46,227
Now, this is a condom,

This is "dark".

You think you're ready?

1037
01:17:12,688 --> 01:17:14,254
I was born ready.

1038
01:17:40,157 --> 01:17:43,091
And deserve even the "dark".
