00:01:25,303 --> 00:01:32,200
Histories, like ancient ruins,
are the fictions of empires.

While everything forgotten
hangs in dark dreams of the past...

I want to be a truck-driver.

00:02:49,974 --> 00:02:52,681
I want to be... A pop-idol.

One hundred years later...

Childhood, adults always say,
is the happiest time in life.

19
00:03:36,637 --> 00:03:40,836
But as long as he could
remember, Jack Fairy knew better.

20
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:52,356
Until one mysterious day, when Jack would
discover that somewhere there were others...

21
00:03:52,391 --> 00:03:53,662
...quite like him.

22
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:58,049
Singled out for a great gift.

23
00:04:12,715 --> 00:04:14,728
And one day...

24
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:17,829
...the whole stinking world...

25
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:21,530
...would be theirs.

mean, I've never seen anyone quite like him. "

For once, there was an unknown land...

...full of strange flowers and subtle perfums.

55
00:10:53,237 --> 00:10:57,109
A land of which it is joy
of all the joys to dream.

56
00:10:58,817 --> 00:11:01,273
A land where all things are perfect.

Ok, Lionel. That's it. Thanks.

I don't get it.

93
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:39,220
What don't you get? It was a
stunt. The guy faked his own murder.

94
00:13:39,255 --> 00:13:41,585
- Yeah, but why?
- Publicity.

95
00:13:41,886 --> 00:13:43,986
Arthur, any recollection?

96
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,375
Of what?

97
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:49,076
Of this Slade fellow.

98
00:13:52,191 --> 00:13:57,456
Well, he's an early 70s glam-rock singer.

99

Told you we could count on

00:14:09,018 --> 00:14:11,176
But the president isn't due until the 8th.

"What ever happened to Brian Slade?" Ok?

110
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:37,791
Yeah, and naturally you want me for this,
because I'm the resident Brit. Right?

00:14:38,393 --> 00:14:42,589
Nah. No, no, no. I want
you, because you remember.

120
00:15:15,017 --> 00:15:17,280
Some meaningless prank, a decade old.

121
00:15:18,881 --> 00:15:20,981
Why was is suddenly up
to me to figure it out?

122
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:23,239
Clearly there was something.

Something from the past, spooking me back.

00:18:55,271 --> 00:18:56,371
That's naff.

154
00:18:57,067 --> 00:19:00,249
You're disgusting. You know that?

155
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,241
I'm just going out for a bit.

156
00:21:43,034 --> 00:21:45,215
"Today in London officials
confirmed that the shooting...

157
00:21:45,216 --> 00:21:47,198
...on the 5th of February
of singer Brian Slade... "

158
00:21:47,199 --> 00:21:50,087
"... At London's Lyceum Theatre
was a publicity stunt... "

159
00:21:50,122 --> 00:21:52,975
"mounted by the singer's
company Bijou Music Limited. "

160
00:21:53,374 --> 00:21:57,650
"Manager Jerry Divine announced today that
his company meant no harm in their escapades. "

161
00:21:58,046 --> 00:22:00,432
"That it was intended
solely as entertainment. "

162
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:04,804
"Very unfortunate, very sad and
unfortunate that in this day and age...

163
00:22:05,403 --> 00:22:12,069
"... An artist's quest for artistic
freedom should cost him his career. "

164
00:22:12,268 --> 00:22:15,848
- Warum, denken Sie?
- Why do you think?

165
00:22:17,243 --> 00:22:17,830
"I dunno. "

166
00:22:20,226 --> 00:22:26,091
"I dunno. It got too big, I guess.
Too... Got too schizoid, you know. "

167
00:22:26,787 --> 00:22:31,857
"I mean... He thought he fucking was
Maxwell Demon in the end, you know?"

168
00:22:32,057 --> 00:22:37,027
"And Maxwell Demon...
he thought he was God. "

169
00:22:40,511 --> 00:22:43,293
<i>"Brian Slade sales plummet"</i>

170
00:22:44,088 --> 00:22:46,474
<i>"Brian Slades U.K. Tour cancelled"</i>

171
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:49,955
<i>"Singer Brian Slade scheduled

172
00:22:50,254 --> 00:22:52,441
<i>"Singer Brian Slade charged
with cocaine possession"</i>

173
00:23:07,061 --> 00:23:11,037
Brian Slade? Oh yes.

174
00:23:11,733 --> 00:23:18,095
Quite well. Once upon a time.

175
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:28,038
So?...

176
00:23:29,235 --> 00:23:33,606
So, what was he... what was he... Like?

177
00:23:35,451 --> 00:23:36,750
Who's that? Brian?

178
00:23:39,051 --> 00:23:41,151
Yeah.

179
00:23:48,048 --> 00:23:51,049
Like nothing I'd ever seen before.

180
00:23:56,646 --> 00:24:02,445
And in the end... Like nothing he appeared.

181
00:24:08,144 --> 00:24:14,842
He was... Elegance,
walking arm in arm with lie.

182
00:24:20,241 --> 00:24:23,142
His real name, in fact, was Thomas.

183
00:24:23,241 --> 00:24:27,539
And his father owned a small tiling
business in suburban Birmingham.

184
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:31,239
But Brian never cared much for the suburbs.

185
00:24:31,438 --> 00:24:36,536
As a young boy, he had the rare fortune of
spending a summer in London with his aunt.

186
00:24:36,837 --> 00:24:40,636
A figure of some ill repute in the Slade
family, after she married a cockney...

187
00:24:40,936 --> 00:24:47,035
...in the entertainment field and
followed him off to Deptford.

188
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:45,522
Brian's tender introduction
to the theatrical underworld...

189
00:25:46,823 --> 00:25:49,023
...would leave a dramatic impression.

190
00:26:19,014 --> 00:26:21,514
So what are you? A mod or a rocker?

191
00:26:21,915 --> 00:26:24,615
Six of one, half a dozen
of the other, really.

192
00:26:26,613 --> 00:26:31,912
Taking their cue from Little Richard, the
swank London mods – short for modernists –

193
00:26:32,511 --> 00:26:35,711
...were the first to wear
mascara and lacquer their hair.

194
00:26:35,911 --> 00:26:38,509
The first true Dandies of pop...

195
00:26:39,509 --> 00:26:45,609
...and known to just about any indiscretion,
where a good suit was involved.

196
00:26:58,705 --> 00:27:00,504
All right, lads?

197
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,898
Style... Always wins out in the end.

198
00:27:40,598 --> 00:27:41,597
Cheers!

199
00:27:42,298 --> 00:27:45,298
For Brian, the mods were
a glamorous call to arms.

200
00:27:45,895 --> 00:27:48,995
Or at least to London,
where three years later...

201
00:27:49,195 --> 00:27:54,093
...at the Sombrero Club in Kensington, I
would hear him sing for the very first time.

202
00:27:58,292 --> 00:28:03,691
Everything, it seemed, started at the Sombrero.
No club in London had more notorious sway.

203
00:28:05,292 --> 00:28:09,889
And there, at the centre of it
was Brian's American wife, Mandy...

204
00:28:10,191 --> 00:28:12,788
...who's dramatic
transformation to London party...

205
00:28:12,789 --> 00:28:15,788
...girl was a constant source
of amusement to us all.

206
00:28:16,289 --> 00:28:18,888
You all know me. Subtlety is my middle name.

207
00:28:19,188 --> 00:28:23,887
It’s as subtle as the piece of skin
between my vagina and my anus – ooh la! La!

208
00:28:24,187 --> 00:28:28,686
Now what’s is that called, does
anyone remember what that's called?

209
00:28:28,886 --> 00:28:32,985
No man’s land! Oh gosh, my geesh, darling!

210
00:28:33,284 --> 00:28:35,784
Now, ladies of and gentlemen, boys and girls.

211
00:28:36,285 --> 00:28:38,285
And whomever else who may
be in the house this evening.

212
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:41,383
It is my supreme pleasure...

213
00:28:42,084 --> 00:28:45,081
...to introduce all you lovely
little minxes here tonight...

214
00:28:45,582 --> 00:28:49,682
...to the Sombrero Club’s prettiest star...

215
00:28:49,717 --> 00:28:53,279
...and my most shimmering hubby!

216
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:56,680
I give you Brian Slade!

217
00:30:17,961 --> 00:30:19,661
Say, have a look at Miss Beautiful"!

218
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:24,859
- Have a look at the homosexual!
- A slut, mates, a slut in fancy clothes!

219
00:30:25,059 --> 00:30:27,958
- Who is he?
- Some scrubber my dear, I do assure you.

220
00:30:29,158 --> 00:30:34,558
- But not that scruffy, as I last recall.
- Ooh, you’re wicked.

221
00:30:42,755 --> 00:30:45,355
He won’t be home tonight.

222
00:30:47,553 --> 00:30:48,952
So, I introduced myself.

223
00:30:49,251 --> 00:30:54,551
Told him I was developing my own management
company and on the look-out for new talent.

224
00:30:55,352 --> 00:30:58,451
He introduced me to his wife,
asked me what sign I was...

225
00:30:58,549 --> 00:31:02,449
...and before the week was out,
we were signing contracts.

226
00:31:07,548 --> 00:31:11,147
You see, Brian believed in the future.

227
00:31:13,248 --> 00:31:15,847
He despised the hypocrisy of the
"peace and love" generation...

228
00:31:16,246 --> 00:31:21,046
...and felt his music spoke far more
to its orphans and its outcasts.

229
00:31:21,245 --> 00:31:25,845
His revolution, he used to
say, will be a sexual one.

230
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:29,941
But in 1970, rock audiences bred on...

231
00:31:30,142 --> 00:31:32,243
Credence Clearwater and the Beatles...

232
00:31:32,742 --> 00:31:38,140
...were not entirely sure what to make
of this particular brand of revolt.

233
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:59,135
Somehow he got it into his head
that he had to perform in a frock.

234
00:31:59,335 --> 00:32:04,036
Don’t ask me why. I mean, I thought it was
a bit naughty, a bit of a giggle, but...

235
00:32:18,433 --> 00:32:22,032
- Who’s this geezer, then? -
Some shirt-lifter from Birmingham.

236
00:32:36,228 --> 00:32:39,729
Get the fuck off! Cut the shite!

237
00:32:40,529 --> 00:32:44,128
- Bugger off, you woofter!
- Fuck off!

238
00:32:50,226 --> 00:32:54,524
Darling? Darling, you were fabulous!

239
00:32:54,726 --> 00:32:57,723
Every bit! I was beaming,
truly, like someone’s mum.

240
00:32:57,924 --> 00:33:02,323
And they adored you! The whole lot
- Transported!

241
00:33:02,521 --> 00:33:05,322
Transported? We went down
like a fucking knackered lift!

242
00:33:05,521 --> 00:33:08,422
Brian, I tell you, I think it's
simply a matter of presentation.

243
00:33:08,921 --> 00:33:10,820
- And with the proper
back-up... - Back-up?

244
00:33:11,321 --> 00:33:14,284
What happened to Judy Garland? What happened
to all your bloody torch song rubbish?

245
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:16,679
I know, I know, in a cabaret,
but in the context of a rock...

246
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,919
...show, I can see now, it's
just a little bit more dodgy.

247
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:22,718
The act was there, wasn’t it?
The act was there. Just a...

248
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:24,719
Brian!

249
00:33:25,417 --> 00:33:29,816
Lead singer and founder of the
greatest garage band know to mankind...

250
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:33,189
CURT WILD!

251
00:34:27,004 --> 00:34:31,503
Curt Wild, founder of the
influential garage band The Rats...

252
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:35,301
...came from the aluminium
trailer parks of Michigan...

253
00:34:35,601 --> 00:34:40,101
...where rock folklore claims
far more primitive origins.

254
00:35:20,891 --> 00:35:26,491
According to legend, when Curt was 13, he was
discovered by his mother in the family loo...

255
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,891
"servicing" his older brother...

256
00:35:30,489 --> 00:35:34,388
...and promptly shipped off for
18 months of schock treatment.

257
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:20,179
The doctors guaranteed the treatment
would fry the fairy clean out of him.

258
00:36:22,578 --> 00:36:27,477
But all it did was make him bonkers...
every time he heard electric guitar.

259
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,765
They despised him.

260
00:37:21,866 --> 00:37:23,166
Yeah.

261
00:37:25,263 --> 00:37:31,062
But when you're abused like that...
you know you've touched the stars.

262
00:37:31,563 --> 00:37:36,761
I know. I just... I just wish it'd been me.

263
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,960
Wish I'd thought of it.

264
00:37:50,561 --> 00:37:55,359
You will, luv. You will.

265
00:40:38,422 --> 00:40:40,022
- Nice stuff.
- Thanks.

266
00:40:40,222 --> 00:40:44,319
Devine. Jerry Devine. Personal
management. I’m interested.

267
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:48,617
Oh, well, thank you, but I
already have management. He's...

268
00:40:49,319 --> 00:40:50,518
Not in my opinion.

269
00:40:52,518 --> 00:40:56,217
The truth is you have talent. That's obvious.

270
00:40:56,918 --> 00:40:59,616
But it doesn't really matter
much what a man does in his life.

271
00:41:00,716 --> 00:41:03,715
What matters... is the legend
that grows up around him.

272
00:41:04,715 --> 00:41:08,213
Today, you're a talented
singer. That's all right.

273
00:41:12,413 --> 00:41:16,813
- I can make you a star.
- And just how do you propose to do that?

274
00:41:19,213 --> 00:41:20,210
I will tell you, sir...

275
00:41:26,111 --> 00:41:27,511
When you pin me.

276
00:41:35,608 --> 00:41:37,209
I've never in all my life...

277
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:39,410
May the best man win.

278
00:42:09,101 --> 00:42:13,400
Earlier tonight, on the popular chart show
'Top of the Pops', newcomer Brian Slade...

279
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:16,263
...performed his hit single
'The Whole Shebang'...

280
00:42:16,298 --> 00:42:19,399
...dressed in platform boots and
wearing glitter eye make-up.

281
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:22,997
A spokesman for the show, known for
showcasing pop's brightest stars...

282
00:42:23,397 --> 00:42:25,996
...says they’ve been deluged
with calls all evening.

283
00:42:26,397 --> 00:42:30,497
The next day every schoolgirl in
London was wearing glitter eye make-up.

284
00:42:30,897 --> 00:42:32,695
And I was out of a bleeding job.

285
00:42:34,596 --> 00:42:38,894
And that, as they say, was that.

286
00:42:39,894 --> 00:42:42,592
I would not hear another word from Brian -

287
00:42:43,592 --> 00:42:46,990
...or any of them for that matter
- Ever again.

288
00:42:48,192 --> 00:42:54,889
Have you got any idea what ultimately
happened to him? I mean, where is he today?

289
00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:58,390
Last I heard he’d returned
to Birmingham, but...

290
00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:02,088
...this was three years ago? Four?

291
00:43:02,787 --> 00:43:06,887
No, I'm sorry, I'm afraid
I can't help you there.

292
00:43:07,987 --> 00:43:11,986
- Looks as though it may be unavoidable.
- What's that.

293
00:43:12,485 --> 00:43:15,286
The ex, I'm afraid.

294
00:43:16,085 --> 00:43:18,485
But then ever story needs
a contrary opinion...

295
00:43:18,984 --> 00:43:24,882
...and with Mandy you're
guaranteed excesses of both.

296
00:43:32,488 --> 00:43:37,886
- Miss Slade?
- Yeah?

297
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:42,980
I’m Arthur Stuart, from the
Herald. We spoke on the phone.

298
00:43:49,678 --> 00:43:52,677
Anyway, I've just got a few questions I
wanted to ask. It shouldn't take too long.

299
00:43:54,876 --> 00:43:56,175
Do you mind if I sit down?

300
00:43:56,276 --> 00:43:58,676
It's a free country. Sort of.

301
00:44:02,474 --> 00:44:03,372
So, what are you having?

302
00:44:05,173 --> 00:44:08,873
Scotch. Rocks.

303
00:44:11,072 --> 00:44:12,473
Yeah, make that two.

304
00:44:13,772 --> 00:44:16,970
Gee. You must be after
some damn exclusive copy.

305
00:44:17,471 --> 00:44:20,169
Well, it's a piece on Brian Slade.

306
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:25,168
- What, sort of a memory jog kind of thing?
- Yeah.

307
00:44:26,568 --> 00:44:32,068
Well it's been, ten years since
the whole... Fake shooting incident.

308
00:44:32,266 --> 00:44:37,666
Oh, and what a fake it was. Tricking us all
in the end with such an authentic demise.

309
00:44:39,066 --> 00:44:41,664
His career, you mean?

310
00:44:43,364 --> 00:44:48,063
I mean, have you got any idea what
happened to him or where he is today?

311
00:44:48,363 --> 00:44:52,862
Can't you just, run him through
the files? Punch in the name?

312
00:44:53,063 --> 00:44:53,860
No, not exactly.

313
00:44:56,261 --> 00:44:57,461
Because, honestly darling...

314
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:01,960
I haven't spoken with Mr Slade in...

315
00:45:03,661 --> 00:45:08,059
...seven years. At least.
- Seven years? Wow.

316
00:45:08,358 --> 00:45:14,557
- Wow. Yeah. At least. Smoke?
- No thanks.

317
00:45:15,457 --> 00:45:20,358
No, right after everything
crashed, we... we split.

318
00:45:21,156 --> 00:45:25,356
And Brian, he just...

319
00:45:29,155 --> 00:45:32,252
...became someone else.

320
00:45:34,953 --> 00:45:37,053
But again, he always was.

321
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:00,347
That's 10 bob to you, mate.

322
00:46:14,244 --> 00:46:18,044
It was New Year's Eve 1969,
the start of a new decade...

323
00:46:18,642 --> 00:46:21,642
...and everywhere you went there
was this sense of the future...

324
00:46:22,142 --> 00:46:24,840
...the feeling in the air
that anything was possible.

325
00:47:25,427 --> 00:47:30,125
See, Jack Fairy had also come to
London in the swinging sixties.

326
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:41,924
And in crowded clubs or hotel bars,
this shipwreck of the streets...

327
00:47:42,423 --> 00:47:45,622
...rehearsed his future glory.

328
00:47:47,222 --> 00:47:52,118
A cigarette tracing a ladder to the stars.

329
00:48:18,815 --> 00:48:23,014
"Maricon, épicène, sexe douteux"
(Faggot, androgyne, sexless)

330
00:48:24,219 --> 00:48:26,718
"Le Vice Anglais" (The English Vice)

331
00:48:31,412 --> 00:48:35,210
I needn't mention how
essential dreaming is...

332
00:48:35,411 --> 00:48:38,110
...to the character of the rock star.

333
00:48:40,310 --> 00:48:42,109
Jack, darling!

334
00:48:44,609 --> 00:48:51,706
Jack was truly the first of his kind. A
true original. Everybody stole from Jack.

335
00:48:56,607 --> 00:49:06,104
But from the moment Brian Slade stepped into
our lives, nothing would ever be the same.

336
00:49:10,203 --> 00:49:12,301
It was his nature.

337
00:49:59,890 --> 00:50:01,290
Do you jive?

338
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:52,079
So... I married him.

339
00:52:25,557 --> 00:52:31,657
Times, places, people...

340
00:52:36,057 --> 00:52:38,355
They're all speeding up.

341
00:52:42,454 --> 00:52:47,153
So to cope with this evolutionary paranoia...

342
00:52:50,854 --> 00:52:54,151
...strange people are chosen...

343
00:52:56,150 --> 00:53:03,150
...who, through their art, can
move progress more quickly.

344
00:53:05,350 --> 00:53:12,447
It was the most stimulating and
reflective period of our marriage.

345
00:53:26,944 --> 00:53:30,743
"Thank you and welcome, pop
pickers, to 'Pick of the Pops'."

346
00:53:31,442 --> 00:53:33,640
"I'm Davy Rocket and we have a
very special show for you today... "

347
00:53:33,739 --> 00:53:37,605
"dedicated to one of pop's
blazing new talents... "

348
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:41,342
"and one who's been holding a
virtual reign over the British...

349
00:53:41,343 --> 00:53:44,740
...charts for a startling record
breaking 18-month span. "

350
00:53:45,239 --> 00:53:48,239
"Ladies and gentlemen, I give you
the incomparable Brian Slade. "

351
00:53:48,538 --> 00:53:52,737
"Or should I say... Maxwell Demon. "

352
00:53:55,136 --> 00:53:56,936
The bloke at the front.

353
00:53:57,237 --> 00:53:59,334
Brian, why the make-up?

354
00:54:00,336 --> 00:54:04,834
Why? Because rock and roll's a prostitute!
It should be tarted up! Performed!

355
00:54:05,635 --> 00:54:11,734
The music is the mask, while I, in my
chiffon and taff, well, varda the message.

356
00:54:11,769 --> 00:54:11,769
Brian, Brian!

357
00:54:16,733 --> 00:54:17,732
Bloke in the suit there.

358
00:54:17,931 --> 00:54:20,931
What about your fans? Aren't they
likely to get the... wrong impression?

359
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:25,430
- And which wrong impression is that?
- Well, that you're a blinking fruit!

360
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:30,229
Well thank you, sir, and no, it
doesn't concern me in the least.

361
00:54:31,227 --> 00:54:33,528
I should think that if people were
to get that impression of me...

362
00:54:34,028 --> 00:54:36,727
...the one to which you so eloquently refer...

363
00:54:37,626 --> 00:54:40,703
...it would not be a wrong
impression in the slightest.

364
00:54:40,704 --> 00:54:43,026
That is me, that's me dad, that's me!

365
00:54:43,127 --> 00:54:46,326
I mean, everybody knows
most people are bisexual.

366
00:54:46,327 --> 00:54:47,327
Any more questions?

367
00:54:49,124 --> 00:54:50,423
Yeah, woman with the beret.

368
00:54:50,424 --> 00:54:53,124
I was under the impression that you
were married and living North London...

369
00:54:54,024 --> 00:54:55,824
I am married. Quite happily, in fact.

370
00:54:56,924 --> 00:54:58,923
I just happen to like boys
as much as I like girls.

371
00:54:59,122 --> 00:55:02,022
And seeing as my wife feels pretty
much the same about such things...

372
00:55:02,823 --> 00:55:06,223
I should think we've been able to
make a fairly decent go of it so far.

373
00:55:09,121 --> 00:55:13,620
Alright, any more questions?
Okay, thank you very much.

374
00:55:13,819 --> 00:55:17,618
For the first time in Brian's life,
he was simply telling it like it was.

375
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:21,417
Did he realize what he'd actually done?

376
00:55:21,718 --> 00:55:26,018
How could he have? I mean today,
there'd be fighting in the streets.

377
00:55:26,317 --> 00:55:30,716
But in 1972... it was more like dancing.

378
00:55:31,515 --> 00:55:34,616
A Star is Born
- And He Twinkles...

379
00:55:35,016 --> 00:55:37,014
Gay stunt at Slade show...

380
00:55:37,615 --> 00:55:39,413
All that glitters
- is gay!

381
00:55:54,210 --> 00:55:57,111
That man, sitting over
there in the white suit...

382
00:55:57,311 --> 00:56:02,210
...is the biggest thing to come out of
this country since sliced Beatles.

383
00:56:02,408 --> 00:56:06,408
Outside this country, no
one knows who the hell he is.

384
00:56:08,607 --> 00:56:11,607
You people, you're gonna change all that.

385
00:56:11,806 --> 00:56:15,106
You guys, you're the
actors. It's up to you...

386
00:56:15,307 --> 00:56:20,803
...to change Brian Slade, pop singer, into
Maxwell Demon, space-age fucking superstar!

387
00:56:22,106 --> 00:56:26,204
Nothing fantastic about it. Why?

388
00:56:26,402 --> 00:56:29,403
Because the secret of becoming a star...

389
00:56:29,602 --> 00:56:31,801
...is knowing how to behave like one.

390
00:56:32,002 --> 00:56:35,901
- Hey kids, let's put on a show!
- Precisely.

391
00:56:37,077 --> 00:56:38,176
Action!

392
00:57:00,095 --> 00:57:06,393
Cut! Cut! Cut! Cut! Sort him out!

393
00:57:10,394 --> 00:57:13,592
I know it's unprecedented, I
know it's unorthodox, but sir...

394
00:57:13,791 --> 00:57:17,092
...if you want Brian Slade, those are the terms.

395
00:57:17,292 --> 00:57:19,191
You may take them or leave them.

396
00:57:20,188 --> 00:57:20,516
Yes?

397
00:57:20,517 --> 00:57:22,430
- I'm Shannon Hazelbourne.
- Who?

398
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:24,785
- I rang up about the position.
- The what?

399
00:57:24,987 --> 00:57:28,786
- Assistant Clerical Aid?
- Oh, the position. Fine. Brilliant. Follow me!

400
00:57:29,185 --> 00:57:32,886
- Hurray! Zounds!
- Now, Shannon, I realize of course...

401
00:57:33,086 --> 00:57:36,284
...your talents lie within the clerical art...

402
00:57:36,485 --> 00:57:41,883
...but I was wondering, by chance if
you had any experience with wardrobe?

403
00:57:42,083 --> 00:57:43,883
No, never.

404
00:57:44,082 --> 00:57:48,581
- Fantastic. I think that's everything.
- No, I said I didn't.

405
00:57:48,782 --> 00:57:51,282
Everybody! I'd like to introduce...

406
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:56,079
...you to our lovely new Wardrobe Mistress.

407
00:57:58,479 --> 00:58:02,478
- Shannon.
- Shannon. Welcome Shannon!

408
00:58:03,479 --> 00:58:07,177
Excellent! Yes, Mr Weinberg!

409
00:58:08,775 --> 00:58:12,775
Thank you very much indeed, sir. Cheers!

410
00:58:14,777 --> 00:58:19,075
- Extraordinary!
- What Jerry? What?

411
00:58:19,674 --> 00:58:25,373
So tell me, Master Demon... Who
would you most fancy meeting...

412
00:58:26,375 --> 00:58:27,072
...in America?

413
00:58:27,573 --> 00:58:34,171
- Ah, bravo! Jerry! Garbo, Brian,
please! - Brando for me. -Einstein.

414
00:58:34,871 --> 00:58:37,671
- Very sorry chickee. He's dead.
- Jerry said anyone.

415
00:58:38,077 --> 00:58:41,477
Brian? Who?

416
00:58:42,169 --> 00:58:46,867
Curt Wild. I want to meet Curt Wild.

417
00:58:48,370 --> 00:58:51,767
And meet Curt Wild we did.

418
00:59:51,052 --> 00:59:56,052
- Mr Wild? -Yeah? - I'm Rodney from
Electra. I have Brian Slade here...

419
00:59:56,251 --> 00:59:58,263
...from England who just wanted
to pop over, say hello.

420
00:59:58,264 --> 00:59:59,250
I just wanted to say...

421
00:59:59,949 --> 01:00:05,348
I think your music is tops.
Really, smashing. Best of the lot.

422
01:00:05,850 --> 01:00:14,145
Smashing... Top of... Jolly... Shit.

423
01:00:20,246 --> 01:00:23,544
Sorry, darling.

424
01:00:26,644 --> 01:00:30,643
Now at that time, Curt Wild was
between management and Brian knew this...

425
01:00:30,842 --> 01:00:34,042
...of course, and urged Devine
to pursue the situation.

426
01:00:34,241 --> 01:00:37,841
And so if, in that probability,
an interest arose...

427
01:00:38,042 --> 01:00:43,739
...in which Brian would serve on some
projects, possibly, though not exclusively...

428
01:00:44,041 --> 01:00:46,738
...as... we're taking our
lead from you here, Curt...

429
01:00:47,739 --> 01:00:50,238
...possibly as producer on that project.

430
01:00:50,638 --> 01:00:54,137
How might that scenario,
purely hypothetically...

431
01:00:54,337 --> 01:00:59,636
...how might that scenario
appeal to you at this juncture?

432
01:01:02,134 --> 01:01:05,034
What Jerry's trying to say is do you
want to come to London to cut a record?

433
01:01:06,035 --> 01:01:07,235
Oh, yeah. Cool.

434
01:01:08,533 --> 01:01:12,334
- Very good!
- But how can we help you?

435
01:01:12,833 --> 01:01:16,532
You must tell us. What do you need?

436
01:01:18,833 --> 01:01:20,033
Everything.

437
01:01:21,131 --> 01:01:27,930
See, heroin was my mainman. But now I'm on
the methadone and I'm getting my act together.

438
01:01:29,330 --> 01:01:33,928
You come here and say you wanna
help and I say, hey, far out.

439
01:01:37,927 --> 01:01:39,728
You could be my mainman.

440
01:01:42,026 --> 01:01:45,827
It was pretty clear what was
happening. It happens every day.

441
01:01:46,026 --> 01:01:48,825
But for the world to think
it was happening, well...

442
01:01:49,026 --> 01:01:51,925
That was Jerry's particular genius.

443
01:01:55,925 --> 01:02:01,623
Right away he started promoting the two of
them like a pair of 40s starlets on the swoon.

444
01:02:02,523 --> 01:02:06,722
A Tracy and Hepburn for the 70s.

445
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:46,400
My career was on the skids, mate.

446
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:51,398
And you fished me out of the muck.
You got me back on my feet, you did.

447
01:03:51,598 --> 01:03:54,097
It was nothing, chum. I wanted to help you...

448
01:03:54,296 --> 01:04:00,496
...make more of that far out sound. I
love your music, my son, and I love...

449
01:04:06,296 --> 01:04:09,392
You don't have to say it, mate.

450
01:04:55,584 --> 01:05:00,882
Every great century that produces art
is, so far, an artificial century...

451
01:05:01,482 --> 01:05:04,582
...and the work that seems the most
natural and simple of its time...

452
01:05:05,181 --> 01:05:09,280
...is always the result of the
most self-conscious effort.

453
01:05:09,881 --> 01:05:15,678
I am not really myself except
in the midst of elegant crowds...

454
01:05:16,078 --> 01:05:17,978
...at the heart of rich districts...

455
01:05:18,277 --> 01:05:22,477
...or amid the sumptuous
ornamentation of palace hotels...

456
01:05:22,678 --> 01:05:26,876
...an army of servants and
a plush carpet underfoot...

457
01:05:27,976 --> 01:05:33,475
What is true about music is true about
life: that beauty reveals everything...

458
01:05:33,675 --> 01:05:36,276
...because it expresses nothing.

459
01:05:36,475 --> 01:05:39,674
The first duty in life is to assume a post.

460
01:05:40,172 --> 01:05:45,473
What the second duty is
no one has yet found out.

461
01:05:56,670 --> 01:06:00,070
The Aesthete Gives
Characteristically Cynical Evidence...

462
01:06:00,670 --> 01:06:04,468
Replete with Pointed Epigram
and Startling Paradox...

463
01:06:04,667 --> 01:06:08,667
...while Explaining His
Views on Morality in Art.

464
01:06:09,542 --> 01:06:11,042
Brian, Brian!

465
01:06:12,267 --> 01:06:15,966
Maxwell Demon is the story of a space
creature, who becomes a rock and roll messiah...

466
01:06:16,265 --> 01:06:19,165
...only to be destroyed by his own success.

467
01:06:19,465 --> 01:06:23,464
Are you saying this is your
destiny? Are you Maxwell Demon?

468
01:06:24,264 --> 01:06:27,164
Man is least himself, when
he talks in his own person!

469
01:06:28,063 --> 01:06:33,061
- Give him a mask and he'll tell you the truth!
- Brian! Brian!

470
01:06:33,562 --> 01:06:36,862
Is it your belief that
all dandies are homosexual?

471
01:06:37,861 --> 01:06:41,460
Ha! Nothing makes one so vain
as being told one is a sinner!

472
01:06:48,759 --> 01:06:55,056
Hey! Coming through! Coming through!
Hey guys. Watch out! Excuse me!

473
01:06:55,358 --> 01:06:58,457
- Coming through. Careful now! There you go.
- Tell us Brian!

474
01:06:58,856 --> 01:07:03,554
Are the rumours true that say you and Curt
Wild have some sort of plans up your sleeve?

475
01:07:03,754 --> 01:07:07,954
Oh, yes! Quite soon we actually
plan to take over the world.

476
01:07:19,852 --> 01:07:25,150
Excuse me, fellas, while I raise a
glass to the loveliest man in Europe!

477
01:07:27,650 --> 01:07:31,150
And they tell you it's not natural!

478
01:07:46,446 --> 01:07:49,345
The world is changed because
you are made of ivory and gold.

479
01:07:50,145 --> 01:07:54,543
The curves of your lips rewrite history.

480
01:11:12,899 --> 01:11:13,899
This is too much!

481
01:11:14,799 --> 01:11:18,198
Jim! What are you gonna do? Jim!

482
01:12:02,083 --> 01:12:08,184
Could you conceivably turn down that
blasted... Arthur! Arthur, open this door!

483
01:12:12,383 --> 01:12:18,381
You bring shame to this house. You
bring shame to your mother and me.

484
01:12:19,881 --> 01:12:23,980
It’s a shameful, filthy thing you’re doing...

485
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:28,680
Do you hear me? Stand up!

486
01:13:08,170 --> 01:13:12,769
It's funny how beautiful people look
when they're walking out the door.

487
01:13:35,063 --> 01:13:37,963
Really Shannon, it’s no problem, honestly.

488
01:13:38,563 --> 01:13:43,262
I’m not fussed about it, I’m quite open about it.
I was having a fabulous time last night myself.

489
01:13:47,862 --> 01:13:50,059
Really luv.

490
01:13:51,861 --> 01:13:55,759
You shouldn’t let it upset you
so. Brian is a grown man and...

491
01:13:56,558 --> 01:13:59,359
...fully capable of shagging
whatever he fancies and...

492
01:13:59,558 --> 01:14:03,358
...exceedingly partial to the practice.

493
01:14:04,557 --> 01:14:06,757
Now, just because someone seea, you know...

494
01:14:06,957 --> 01:14:09,757
...two naked people asleep in bed together...

495
01:14:09,956 --> 01:14:13,855
...it doesn’t necessarily
prove sex was involved.

496
01:14:24,653 --> 01:14:28,553
It does, however, make
for a very strong case.

497
01:14:29,152 --> 01:14:34,550
But you’re a sweet, sensitive
darling to be so broken up about it.

498
01:14:34,750 --> 01:14:36,549
Brian would be absolutely
chuffed to know that you...

499
01:14:37,351 --> 01:14:40,850
Don’t you ever dare tell Brian!

500
01:14:41,049 --> 01:14:45,948
Swear to me you’ll never say a word. Ever.

501
01:14:49,547 --> 01:14:51,144
I swear.

502
01:14:57,045 --> 01:14:58,045
Jesus!

503
01:15:32,437 --> 01:15:38,134
Sudden change in plans.
Brief holiday, much needed.

504
01:15:38,335 --> 01:15:39,736
Back by Hammersmith.

505
01:15:42,437 --> 01:15:43,437
B.

506
01:15:46,734 --> 01:15:49,232
That was it.

507
01:15:52,134 --> 01:15:57,030
Look I’m sorry. I wish I could help you
more. You seem like a nice guy. I just...

508
01:16:01,830 --> 01:16:04,430
...don’t think I have
what you’re looking for.

509
01:16:07,829 --> 01:16:10,527
See... I think you do actually.

510
01:16:11,825 --> 01:16:16,723
Oh yeah? And what makes you think so?

511
01:16:19,124 --> 01:16:21,824
Well that smile, for one thing.

512
01:16:23,624 --> 01:16:26,922
Well, smiles lie.

513
01:16:29,123 --> 01:16:30,123
Exactly.

514
01:16:36,421 --> 01:16:43,217
Listen. Once, of course, it
was a gorgeous gorgeous time.

515
01:16:43,318 --> 01:16:47,818
We were all... Living our dreams.

516
01:16:51,316 --> 01:16:53,515
But you see all that went away.

517
01:16:56,115 --> 01:16:57,213
All of it.

518
01:17:00,114 --> 01:17:01,714
With Curt.

519
01:17:02,512 --> 01:17:07,814
And not even the real Curt. I mean, it was
this... idea of Curt more than anything, this...

520
01:17:10,812 --> 01:17:15,210
...image. Which, of course, nobody
could ever possibly live up to.

521
01:17:15,311 --> 01:17:19,511
I mean Maxwell Demon, Curt
Wild. They were fictions!

522
01:17:23,308 --> 01:17:29,508
Somewhere along the way, Brian
seemed to get lost in the lie.

523
01:17:57,800 --> 01:17:59,100
- Shit!
- Cut it.

524
01:17:59,701 --> 01:18:00,601
Should I stop it?

525
01:18:14,096 --> 01:18:17,294
- He’s gonna hit the bridge a half-verse
early. - Now you’re simply wasting tape.

526
01:18:17,470 --> 01:18:18,969
Alright. Cut it.

527
01:18:23,693 --> 01:18:27,991
What? What? Is there a problem?

528
01:18:29,892 --> 01:18:32,090
- Again.
- What? What?

529
01:18:32,591 --> 01:18:34,491
- Sorry, Curt, but it appears...
- What?

530
01:18:35,190 --> 01:18:38,289
Curt, we only ask that when
you decide to make a change...

531
01:18:38,890 --> 01:18:42,288
...you simply inform us in advance, so
Eton here is properly prepared, otherwise...

532
01:18:42,389 --> 01:18:43,389
What the fuck are you talking about man?

533
01:18:46,087 --> 01:18:47,587
I didn’t make any fucking changes!

534
01:18:55,862 --> 01:18:58,362
Brian?

535
01:19:01,384 --> 01:19:05,671
Fucking mother fucker! Mother
fucker, you’re a mother fucker!

536
01:19:05,672 --> 01:19:08,783
Fuck you! Fuck you, mother fucker! Fuck you!

537
01:19:10,183 --> 01:19:13,883
Eton! Eton, please!

538
01:19:15,583 --> 01:19:17,448
Brian, I’m sorry to be the
one to have to tell you this...

539
01:19:17,449 --> 01:19:19,182
...but what started off as an
interesting experiment...

540
01:19:19,481 --> 01:19:23,180
...has quite frankly descended into a
demeaning waste of your time and mine.

541
01:19:23,780 --> 01:19:26,579
- I mean, you’ve already spent forty
hours studio time... - Thirty-six.

542
01:19:26,678 --> 01:19:30,878
Whatever! Thirty-six hours studio
time on two, three bloody cuts!

543
01:19:32,077 --> 01:19:34,296
Brian, you seem to forget,
you’re a very big star now and...

544
01:19:34,297 --> 01:19:36,477
I think your time is worth
a great deal more than this -

545
01:19:37,077 --> 01:19:40,470
Fucking space-queen on
your fucking high horse!

546
01:19:40,471 --> 01:19:44,075
And all your fucking
henchmen! Fuck you, fuck you!

547
01:19:47,774 --> 01:19:50,073
Perhaps it’s time for another
little break. Hey fellas?

548
01:19:53,373 --> 01:19:54,373
Give us a stretch.

549
01:20:03,471 --> 01:20:05,866
Jerry?

550
01:20:10,467 --> 01:20:12,467
I can’t risk extending his contract, Brian.

551
01:20:14,367 --> 01:20:18,766
I think it’s quite clear why.
I’ll talk to you tomorrow.

552
01:20:32,062 --> 01:20:36,460
Piss off! Go on then! Back to
your wolves! Your junkie twerps!

553
01:20:36,761 --> 01:20:40,959
Your bloody shock
treatment! And fuck you too!

554
01:21:52,444 --> 01:21:54,043
Out!
O- U-T.

555
01:21:54,344 --> 01:21:57,444
Well, Brian. I’m afraid that is
completely out of the question.

556
01:21:58,141 --> 01:22:03,341
You are contractually bound to finish
the Maxwell Demon tour as Maxwell Demon.

557
01:22:03,441 --> 01:22:05,641
Jerry, I'm telling you, it's just
getting far too out of hand...

558
01:22:05,942 --> 01:22:08,537
Brian! I realize you’re
under tremendous strain...

559
01:22:08,538 --> 01:22:12,138
...but you’ve just gotta hang on in
there and finish the bloody tour.

560
01:22:13,139 --> 01:22:15,539
You hang on in there.
I’ll hang on here. Right?

561
01:22:15,540 --> 01:22:18,738
And then you can do what you want. OK?

562
01:23:33,121 --> 01:23:36,621
<i>Brian Slade shooting declared a hoax...</i>

563
01:23:38,319 --> 01:23:42,918
Down with Slade!

564
01:25:00,602 --> 01:25:03,702
I don’t believe that there is
much of a future to speak of.

565
01:25:03,902 --> 01:25:09,501
- We’re in a bit of a decadent spiral, aren’t we?
- Sinking fast.

566
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:14,299
- Big Brother, baby. All the way.
- Which is why we prefer impressions to ideas.

567
01:25:14,498 --> 01:25:18,998
- Situations to subjects.
- Brief flights to sustained ones.

568
01:25:19,297 --> 01:25:23,796
- Exceptions to types.
- And yourself?

569
01:25:27,296 --> 01:25:31,593
Well I’m... I’m just looking
for a room at the moment.

570
01:26:16,583 --> 01:26:20,284
So for one entire day, I
actually think Brian’s been shot.

571
01:26:22,183 --> 01:26:25,183
That the whole thing is real.

572
01:26:26,282 --> 01:26:29,881
All his paranoias proven horribly true.

573
01:26:30,682 --> 01:26:34,382
- You mean, no one told you?
- Nope.

574
01:26:37,479 --> 01:26:38,778
Why?

575
01:26:39,879 --> 01:26:40,879
Forgot.

576
01:26:45,378 --> 01:26:46,175
Jesus!

577
01:26:46,776 --> 01:26:50,776
I mean... I knew it was over. I just...

578
01:26:53,676 --> 01:26:57,475
...didn't know it was
up to me to make it stop.

579
01:27:19,166 --> 01:27:22,765
- Mandy.
- Hello, Brian.

580
01:27:28,066 --> 01:27:29,465
No, thanks.

581
01:27:39,561 --> 01:27:41,264
These are the papers.

582
01:27:42,361 --> 01:27:47,160
I believe they’re in order.
All you need to do is sign.

583
01:28:00,158 --> 01:28:01,257
So you won't forget.

584
01:28:03,156 --> 01:28:06,356
- I already have.
- Evidently!

585
01:28:11,155 --> 01:28:14,935
Fuck you, Brian! Did you ever, for one bloody...

586
01:28:14,936 --> 01:28:19,554
...second in your life, want
anything more... Than this?

587
01:28:20,654 --> 01:28:22,252
No.

588
01:28:27,150 --> 01:28:30,349
Your problem is...

589
01:28:30,350 --> 01:28:34,450
...you get what you want
and do what you will.

590
01:28:35,249 --> 01:28:37,651
Worlds, Mandy, are built out of suffering.

591
01:28:38,550 --> 01:28:42,048
There is suffering at the birth of
a child as at the birth of a star.

592
01:28:42,349 --> 01:28:45,847
You live in terror of
not being misunderstood.

593
01:28:45,848 --> 01:28:51,745
Women defend themselves by attacking, just as
they attack by sudden and strange surrenders.

594
01:28:53,546 --> 01:29:02,244
I lost my girlhood, true. But it was for you.

595
01:29:05,443 --> 01:29:09,142
What in God's name is going on up
here? How the fuck did you get up here?

596
01:29:09,942 --> 01:29:12,343
- Brian, I’m really sorry about...
- It’s alright, Shannon.

597
01:29:12,841 --> 01:29:14,641
Mandy was just leaving.

598
01:29:18,342 --> 01:29:20,442
Mandy, if you’d be so kind as to follow me...

599
01:29:20,540 --> 01:29:24,338
Let go of me. I’m perfectly
capable of making my own...

600
01:29:28,338 --> 01:29:30,237
I really don’t want to have to call someone.

601
01:29:34,438 --> 01:29:36,438
Call someone?

602
01:29:40,036 --> 01:29:43,033
I am his wife, for fuck’s sake!

603
01:29:47,535 --> 01:29:51,133
Fuck the lot of you!

604
01:29:54,733 --> 01:29:57,132
Was that the last time you saw him?

605
01:29:57,331 --> 01:29:58,230
No.

606
01:30:04,029 --> 01:30:08,126
I saw him again. Briefly, a
few weeks later, at a concert.

607
01:30:08,327 --> 01:30:09,327
He was performing?

608
01:30:12,427 --> 01:30:16,326
No. Curt was actually performing.

609
01:30:17,126 --> 01:30:19,424
He and Jack Fairy had just
finished their Berlin record...

610
01:30:19,625 --> 01:30:21,326
...and Curt was in London playing some gigs.

611
01:30:22,125 --> 01:30:26,724
And Brian was there, for a second.
I don’t think anyone even saw him.

612
01:30:30,123 --> 01:30:32,223
Which concert?

613
01:30:38,921 --> 01:30:44,019
It was like a tribute. Sort of
a farewell concert to glam rock.

614
01:30:44,519 --> 01:30:49,618
To save your wild, wild lives.
To neer your fans embitter.

615
01:30:50,319 --> 01:30:55,717
To cease your sad demise. Tonight, we toast!

616
01:31:58,602 --> 01:32:01,203
Is this working? Cos I want it blue-er.

617
01:32:04,802 --> 01:32:08,401
I don’t think you should bother. I think I
should go on stage tonight, instead of you.

618
01:32:09,402 --> 01:32:10,702
Arthur, come on, give us a hand with this.

619
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:19,899
Stop moving about, I’m doing me eyeliner.

620
01:34:06,954 --> 01:34:09,604
"... And due to the overwhelming
demand, there will be...

621
01:34:09,605 --> 01:34:12,351
...additional shows added whenever
and wherever possible. "

622
01:34:12,952 --> 01:34:15,438
"Regrettably, Mr Stone only
has time for a few brief...

623
01:34:15,439 --> 01:34:18,252
questions this morning as he
has a plane catch to Zurich. "

624
01:34:45,053 --> 01:34:49,153
Lou! Lou!

625
01:34:53,152 --> 01:34:55,450
- I’m sorry, Arthur. I’m late. - Lou!
I think I’m on to something. -What?

626
01:34:55,751 --> 01:34:57,471
- Something quite big. I think
I know who Brian Slade is.

627
01:34:57,472 --> 01:34:58,450
Ah, that story’s been dropped.

628
01:35:00,351 --> 01:35:02,450
- What? Why?
- I need you on the Stone show.

629
01:35:03,251 --> 01:35:04,251
But that's it!

630
01:35:06,149 --> 01:35:10,049
What did they say to you? Lou!

631
01:35:14,550 --> 01:35:17,350
Hi, yeah. My name is Arthur
Stuart, from the Herald.

632
01:35:18,851 --> 01:35:23,651
I was given this number and told
I could reach Curt Wild here.

633
01:35:25,252 --> 01:35:30,852
- Listen... (whispers)
- Yeah. Hello? Hello?

634
01:35:31,053 --> 01:35:33,253
Listen, I don’t know who the
hell gave you this number...

635
01:35:33,654 --> 01:35:36,154
...but Curt Wild is not available
and not interested in granting you...

636
01:35:36,255 --> 01:35:38,855
...or anyone else an interview
on this subject. You got it?

637
01:35:40,556 --> 01:35:42,556
I'm sorry. I was told...

638
01:40:13,584 --> 01:40:20,182
- That was really beautiful.
- Yeah? Thanks.

639
01:40:22,982 --> 01:40:26,281
- Did you see him?
- No, I didn't see him.

640
01:40:48,477 --> 01:40:49,574
It’s only now, looking back...

641
01:40:51,376 --> 01:40:56,374
...that I see how you patched through
my walls and entered my life...

642
01:40:58,175 --> 01:40:59,175
...in waves.

643
01:41:03,074 --> 01:41:03,971
Come closer.

644
01:41:09,772 --> 01:41:10,772
Don’t be frightened.

645
01:41:12,570 --> 01:41:18,170
What’s your name? Your
favourite colour? Song? Movie?

646
01:41:20,568 --> 01:41:25,369
- Don’t be nervous. Are you high?
- I’m on a button.

647
01:41:31,167 --> 01:41:36,465
He was waiting for me.
I’d followed his signals...

648
01:41:36,500 --> 01:41:42,066
...and slipped away and now, suddenly...

649
01:41:49,563 --> 01:41:50,961
Hey!

650
01:41:55,727 --> 01:41:56,927
Make a wish!

651
01:42:35,728 --> 01:42:36,728
Hey!

652
01:42:52,448 --> 01:43:00,746
Make a wish! And see
yourself, on-stage, inside-out.

653
01:43:01,847 --> 01:43:07,744
A tangle of garlands in your hair. Of
course you were pleasantly surprised.

654
01:43:09,045 --> 01:43:12,543
Softly, he said:

655
01:43:12,644 --> 01:43:15,044
I will mangle your mind.

656
01:46:08,800 --> 01:46:12,299
Tommy! Tommy! Where did you get the
idea for such a spectacular stadium show?

657
01:46:12,500 --> 01:46:15,698
To tell you the truth – it’s
a bloody pain in the ass!

658
01:46:16,699 --> 01:46:20,599
The whole thing takes six full size rigs
or three chartered planes to transport.

659
01:46:20,899 --> 01:46:22,798
What can I say? I think big!

660
01:46:23,698 --> 01:46:28,197
Tommy! What’s your opinion on the work
that President Reynolds has been doing?

661
01:46:28,397 --> 01:46:30,497
Excellent. Excellent. I think
he’s doing brilliant work.

662
01:46:30,697 --> 01:46:34,660
He’s a tremendous leader, a tremendous
spokesperson for the needs of the nation today.

663
01:46:34,695 --> 01:46:37,915
Tommy! What's your response
to the recent allegations...

664
01:46:37,916 --> 01:46:41,194
...connecting you with bisexual
pop-singer Brian Slade...

665
01:46:41,293 --> 01:46:44,490
...who staged his own assassination
ten years ago this week in London?

666
01:46:44,491 --> 01:46:47,091
...that Mr Stone has time for
this evening. Thank you very much!

667
01:46:50,292 --> 01:46:54,092
Out! Get out!

668
01:46:55,089 --> 01:46:57,618
"... Stone is promoting
his Grammy-winning release...

669
01:46:57,619 --> 01:47:00,487
"People Rockin’ People", to
sold-out arenas worldwide... "

670
01:47:22,589 --> 01:47:24,188
Beer, please.

671
01:47:33,579 --> 01:47:38,678
Excuse me? Sir? Are you
with the Tommy Stone Tour?

672
01:47:43,376 --> 01:47:47,376
No. I’m just a journalist.

673
01:47:48,877 --> 01:47:55,273
Perhaps you’d like my...
press pass? As a souvenir?

674
01:47:56,574 --> 01:47:57,674
Thanks sir.

675
01:48:30,868 --> 01:48:31,964
You're Curt Wild.

676
01:48:34,565 --> 01:48:36,965
Yeah. Who the hell are you?

677
01:48:39,965 --> 01:48:43,363
I’m a journalist. From the Herald.

678
01:48:46,563 --> 01:48:48,363
You were at the concert?

679
01:48:51,563 --> 01:48:55,960
It’s just funny, cause... I was
trying to contact you, actually.

680
01:48:57,461 --> 01:49:00,761
About a story I was doing,
about an old friend of yours.

681
01:49:03,258 --> 01:49:05,058
Brian Slade?

682
01:49:08,159 --> 01:49:09,456
I was trying to find out
what actually happened to him.

683
01:49:09,657 --> 01:49:11,957
- Look...
- I mean, before he became...

684
01:49:14,256 --> 01:49:15,856
...such a mystery.

685
01:49:18,456 --> 01:49:21,753
Look, man, I don’t know who you’ve been
talking to or what you’re after here.

686
01:49:21,854 --> 01:49:22,854
What?

687
01:49:26,354 --> 01:49:27,354
What?

688
01:49:29,854 --> 01:49:34,653
Listen! A real artist creates beautiful things
and puts nothing of his won life into them. Okay?

689
01:49:35,652 --> 01:49:38,151
- Is that what you did?
- No.

690
01:49:40,352 --> 01:49:42,052
We set out to change the world.

691
01:49:44,350 --> 01:49:46,349
Ended up just changing ourselves.

692
01:49:48,250 --> 01:49:49,350
What's wrong with that?

693
01:49:52,349 --> 01:49:53,647
Nothing.

694
01:49:55,548 --> 01:49:57,348
If you don’t look at the world.

695
01:50:08,945 --> 01:50:10,945
Well, I guess in the end
he got what he wanted.

696
01:50:20,743 --> 01:50:24,741
- That’s quite a pin you got there.
- Oh yeah.

697
01:50:25,442 --> 01:50:26,442
Is it old?

698
01:50:27,139 --> 01:50:31,239
Possibly. It belonged to Oscar Wilde.

699
01:50:32,039 --> 01:50:34,139
Or so I was told by the
person who gave it to me.

700
01:50:36,139 --> 01:50:41,339
A friend of mine. Kinda
disappeared some years back.

701
01:50:44,937 --> 01:50:47,936
I forget where we were. We were on a trip.

702
01:50:48,135 --> 01:50:49,635
But he said to me, "Curt...

703
01:50:51,836 --> 01:50:53,636
"... A man’s life is his image. "

704
01:51:06,333 --> 01:51:09,431
- Here. Why don’t you hang on to it?
- Me?

705
01:51:10,332 --> 01:51:11,432
Sure. Why not?

706
01:51:12,631 --> 01:51:16,428
I’ve had it too long anyway. Go ahead.

707
01:51:19,329 --> 01:51:20,629
For your image.

708
01:51:26,327 --> 01:51:35,024
Really. I couldn’t. But thanks.

709
01:51:42,225 --> 01:51:44,424
God, I love this song.

710
01:51:47,422 --> 01:51:50,423
- Anyway.
- Yeah.

711
01:51:53,022 --> 01:51:55,920
- See ya around.
- Cheers!

712
01:52:25,914 --> 01:52:29,379
He called it a freedom.

713
01:52:31,180 --> 01:52:34,580
A freedom you can allow yourself.

714
01:52:37,181 --> 01:52:39,081
Or not.
