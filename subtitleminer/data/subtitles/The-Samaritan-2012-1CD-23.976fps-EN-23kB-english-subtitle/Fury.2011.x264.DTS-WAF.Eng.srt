1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,074


2
00:00:09,242 --> 00:00:12,584

3
00:00:12,586 --> 00:00:15,092

4
00:00:15,196 --> 00:00:18,601

5
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:55,422
I'm sorry.

6
00:01:05,626 --> 00:01:08,296
<i> If you keep doing what you've always done... </ i>

7
00:01:08,966 --> 00:01:12,069
<i> you will keep what you have always been. </ I>

8
00:01:15,149 --> 00:01:18,077
<i> I a cell shared with a guy
those words... </ i>

9
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:21,123
<i> Tattooed on his chest 
in Japanese characters. </ i>

10
00:01:23,502 --> 00:01:25,552
<i> After ten years is that guy out... </ i>

11
00:01:25,553 --> 00:01:30,278
<i> a week later he was killed because
what he was what he always was. </ i>

12
00:01:30,279 --> 00:01:34,047
<i> These words are still on his skin . </ i>

13
00:01:34,048 --> 00:01:36,475
<i> Somewhere buried in a coffin. </ i>

14
00:01:39,017 --> 00:01:42,495
<i>Nothing changes unless you bring that change. </ i>

15
00:01:48,492 --> 00:01:51,259
In case you need me have
call this number.

16
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,620
They know where I am.

17
00:01:53,621 --> 00:01:56,612
Take care 

18
00:01:58,221 --> 00:02:02,012
(fury)

19
00:02:10,426 --> 00:02:13,442
Papa.

20
00:02:51,261 --> 00:02:54,631
not the city and come into contact with someone with a criminal record

21
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:58,111
If you just a digression does go back.

22
00:03:03,721 --> 00:03:06,528
We're done here

23
00:03:06,529 --> 00:03:09,739
Let me know when you have a job,
I will send the papers.

24
00:03:09,775 --> 00:03:11,382
cool

25
00:03:14,535 --> 00:03:17,530
You probation officer can be your friend
or an asshole.

26
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:20,527
That is your decision.

27
00:03:20,528 --> 00:03:22,704
Yes.

28
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:52,753
Is there Rodney?
- No, Rodney is dead.

29
00:03:53,586 --> 00:03:56,196
And Summer?

30
00:03:56,914 --> 00:04:04,382
This is to the west.
I bought this tent six years ago.

31
00:04:06,148 --> 00:04:11,518
Do not bottle Beaumont under the bar?

32
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,585
You knew Rodney.

33
00:04:15,585 --> 00:04:19,648
Old habits you learn difficult.
How do you drink it?

34
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:22,131
Pure.

35
00:04:27,482 --> 00:04:34,348
When I took over there were some guys who said Rodney
owed them something.

36
00:04:34,986 --> 00:04:38,296
Money and obligations and all.

37
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:42,632
That's not happened in a while.

38
00:05:08,101 --> 00:05:12,021
Since  hear them catch thieves,
no ghosts.

39
00:05:12,606 --> 00:05:17,240
If you are in money,
that's all gone now.

40
00:05:17,241 --> 00:05:21,251
I had many agents pay to stay out of jail.

41
00:05:21,285 --> 00:05:25,045
This is a thousand years ago.
- I thought so.

42
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:31,449
Do you have contact with the old crew?

43
00:05:31,486 --> 00:05:33,158
Mike?

44
00:05:33,904 --> 00:05:37,486
He's dead.
He ​​died in prison.

45
00:05:38,353 --> 00:05:40,427
Matt?
- Also dead.

46
00:05:40,428 --> 00:05:43,995
And Sal? That is not dead?
- He is not dead.

47
00:05:43,996 --> 00:05:47,857
Good.
- He lies in a coma in Grace.

48
00:05:47,858 --> 00:05:50,760
If only he had had more time to
his affairs in order.

49
00:05:53,162 --> 00:05:57,228
Gretchen, what happened to your hair?

50
00:05:58,035 --> 00:06:01,152
The past has caught up with me.

51
00:06:01,929 --> 00:06:04,576
No one should make a new start.

52
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:10,772
My children come home soon.
They know nothing about the old days.

53
00:06:10,773 --> 00:06:13,012
I'm glad to see you.

54
00:06:13,116 --> 00:06:16,392
But I do not want you here comes Foley.

55
00:06:16,393 --> 00:06:19,554
ever 

56
00:07:00,872 --> 00:07:03,179
Who are you?

57
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:09,806
I am disappointed.

58
00:07:09,807 --> 00:07:12,936
Do not you see?

59
00:07:13,339 --> 00:07:17,122
The chin and jaw line?

60
00:07:20,058 --> 00:07:23,319
I know I have his eyes.

61
00:07:24,206 --> 00:07:27,133
Yes, I see it.

62
00:07:27,134 --> 00:07:29,652
You're his boy Eddy.
- That is correct.

63
00:07:30,161 --> 00:07:32,572
Ethan.

64
00:07:32,573 --> 00:07:36,868
You have a good memory.
It's a long time ago.

65
00:07:37,328 --> 00:07:39,825
More than 20 years.
- 25.

66
00:07:39,827 --> 00:07:42,203
My mistake.

67
00:07:42,204 --> 00:07:45,465
If a man is so long,
you want the figures are not wrong.

68
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:52,212
I do not blame you that you're suspicious

69
00:07:54,989 --> 00:07:58,672
Here I am.
Sitting in the dark.

70
00:07:58,673 --> 00:08:01,662
I'm waiting for you.
- What do you want from me, Ethan?

71
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:11,066
I want to buy you a drink.

72
00:08:32,832 --> 00:08:35,215
We have a 35% share in this tent.

73
00:08:35,216 --> 00:08:39,182
Easy merit.
That I owe to you and my father.

74
00:08:39,487 --> 00:08:43,062
My father always said you were planning to start a club to

75
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,978
We wanted a bar  begin.
Not what this is.

76
00:08:50,862 --> 00:08:54,150
I'll show you.

77
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:04,666
We take a drink and talk about
the old days and maybe the present.

78
00:09:09,384 --> 00:09:12,652
Xavier is here.
He ​​wants you and me back.

79
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:16,119
Come here.

80
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,382
Bring him to my table.
Everything is free. I'll be back.

81
00:09:40,336 --> 00:09:42,783
Are you alone?

82
00:09:42,784 --> 00:09:47,031
That does not seem right.
- I'm waiting for someone.

83
00:09:51,378 --> 00:09:54,382
I was also waiting for someone.

84
00:09:54,993 --> 00:09:58,038
I just found him.
- Thanks, but no thanks.

85
00:09:58,755 --> 00:10:01,929
Ethan told me I had to come along.

86
00:10:02,534 --> 00:10:05,880
That someone wanted to meet me.
- You have apparently met each other.

87
00:10:06,659 --> 00:10:09,634
Do you want to lose her?
- Take it easy.

88
00:10:09,635 --> 00:10:11,879
So get yourself a stroke.

89
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:16,163
I'm not you  ested in what you
it even sells.

90
00:10:17,557 --> 00:10:23,028
Yes? Pull yourself but occasionally,
because I certainly do not.

91
00:10:24,845 --> 00:10:27,363
You owe me that drink still guilty.

92
00:10:30,661 --> 00:10:33,151
That was me something.

93
00:10:33,188 --> 00:10:35,430
I'm leaving.

94
00:10:36,507 --> 00:10:40,606
I take you home.
Hold on.

95
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:43,502
Wait a minute.

96
00:10:48,198 --> 00:10:53,262
We want to see.
Empty bottles means that business is good.

97
00:10:53,807 --> 00:10:56,643
La Veuve, Dom, Crystal.

98
00:10:56,644 --> 00:10:59,212
All very nice, but...

99
00:10:59,249 --> 00:11:05,043
What have we here?
A Billecart Salmon from 1960.

100
00:11:05,044 --> 00:11:09,700
This is a shame to open them.
They have 10 or 15 years time.

101
00:11:09,701 --> 00:11:12,332
But if you're an asshole of a mutual fund are...

102
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:15,696
And attempts in the pans of a
poor unhappy girl to peek...

103
00:11:15,697 --> 00:11:19,549
Then you do what you gotta do.

104
00:11:22,393 --> 00:11:26,906
I had a '59 from a few weeks ago.
It was spectacular.

105
00:11:26,907 --> 00:11:31,122
The minerals weaving the elements together as silk.

106
00:11:31,776 --> 00:11:37,644
I love champagne.
I drink it often, because I have much to celebrate.

107
00:11:38,308 --> 00:11:41,998
Life is good  as
my people do their work.

108
00:11:42,637 --> 00:11:46,192
This is what happened when you had service, Ethan.

109
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,702
It will not happen again.

110
00:11:49,703 --> 00:11:55,071
Xavier, I caught the bastard.
- Why will you one day, if you're good...

111
00:11:55,072 --> 00:11:58,077
From '59 allowed to taste.

112
00:11:58,937 --> 00:12:01,884
Our colleague here has
that option anymore.

113
00:12:02,627 --> 00:12:05,540
Do you think I would not notice?

114
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:11,490
$ 250,000 and I would not notice?

115
00:12:24,605 --> 00:12:27,436
The
the money will be difficult now to get back.

116
00:12:28,404 --> 00:12:30,983
You can find a solution.

117
00:12:32,806 --> 00:12:35,365
Safe flight.

118
00:12:41,446 --> 00:12:46,257
Wait a minute.
- Yesterday I came out of prison.

119
00:12:46,258 --> 00:12:49,869
Yesterday.
- I know and I'm sorry.

120
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:53,794
Listen to me.
I thought we should go out...

121
00:12:53,795 --> 00:12:57,906
And what would drink.

122
00:12:57,907 --> 00:13:00,857
Probably
I wanted to show you that I am like my father.

123
00:13:03,933 --> 00:13:07,574
The truth is...

124
00:13:08,168 --> 00:13:11,023
I never really knew him.

125
00:13:11,705 --> 00:13:15,632
My mother...
- What do you want from me?

126
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,129
I want to know why you have killed my father.

127
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:43,404
Down there is still a lot of money.

128
00:13:44,129 --> 00:13:47,048
What do you know about me and your father?

129
00:13:47,145 --> 00:13:50,075
Only what my mother told.

130
00:13:50,076 --> 00:13:53,251
That you were good friends.

131
00:13:53,252 --> 00:13:56,630
Partners.
- Did she tell you what we have done?

132
00:13:56,631 --> 00:13:59,168
Our work?
- No.

133
00:13:59,169 --> 00:14:02,134
But I found out.

134
00:14:11,207 --> 00:14:16,337
That's all I could find.
Every article, every photo.

135
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:20,502
Why do you keep all this?
- How could I know him differently?

136
00:14:20,758 --> 00:14:26,049
You were swindlers.
The best in town according to the oldies.

137
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,098
You need this release.

138
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:55,625
Your father is long dead.
- No, I must know him.

139
00:14:55,844 --> 00:14:58,931
Put ​​yourself in me.

140
00:15:07,774 --> 00:15:13,205
We were swindlers.
A long history of various scams.

141
00:15:13,206 --> 00:15:16,851
But, if it worked with much profit.

142
00:15:16,852 --> 00:15:19,610
And it worked.

143
00:15:19,611 --> 00:15:23,456
So your father was greedy and
the target hard uitkneep.

144
00:15:24,171 --> 00:15:26,827
I never found out why.

145
00:15:26,828 --> 00:15:29,271
He had debts.

146
00:15:29,272 --> 00:15:32,182
Up over his head.
Maps, horses.

147
00:15:33,235 --> 00:15:36,021
The
my mother has taken years to repay that.

148
00:15:36,023 --> 00:15:38,618
I'm sorry to hear that.

149
00:15:39,734 --> 00:15:42,424
The target was a tough guy.

150
00:15:42,425 --> 00:15:44,912
Did not care that it was
scammed.

151
00:15:44,913 --> 00:15:51,527
He gave me a choice.
Your father's murder or die with him.

152
00:16:03,154 --> 00:16:06,822
I'm sorry.

153
00:16:19,161 --> 00:16:25,442
I have been in a small room
spent thinking about the choice I made that night.

154
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:28,674
I was young.
Less than you are now.

155
00:16:28,711 --> 00:16:31,325
But I made a choice.

156
00:16:31,326 --> 00:16:35,781
It has never left me.
And I'm punished.

157
00:16:38,023 --> 00:16:41,863
What was his name, that target?

158
00:16:41,864 --> 00:16:45,687
What does it matter?
He ​​was the target.

159
00:16:45,688 --> 00:16:49,380
Your father had put us both in a corner and there was only
way.

160
00:16:49,422 --> 00:16:53,280
If someone had done that,
I would murder him.

161
00:16:55,451 --> 00:16:58,815
I'm just saying...

162
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:04,512
I understand.
Yes, and I think we can help each other.

163
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,538
Look at me once.

164
00:17:07,539 --> 00:17:11,304
25 years of my life are gone.

165
00:17:11,305 --> 00:17:17,412
If you're as smart as you think, you
that room and ripped that shit off the wall...

166
00:17:17,413 --> 00:17:20,053
And throws it away.

167
00:18:41,951 --> 00:18:46,222
We do not socialize.
Can I watch the game?

168
00:18:58,484 --> 00:19:01,569
Give it the cheapest.
- Sit anywhere you like.

169
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:04,213
Do you?

170
00:19:32,494 --> 00:19:35,707
I said no.

171
00:19:41,087 --> 00:19:44,124
They always make a mess.

172
00:20:26,906 --> 00:20:30,276
No.
- Let go.

173
00:20:31,186 --> 00:20:33,877
It means trouble.

174
00:20:33,878 --> 00:20:39,084
No.
Please stop.

175
00:20:39,085 --> 00:20:41,949
Please stop .
- She said stop it.

176
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:45,577
Fuck.
- After you.

177
00:20:58,364 --> 00:21:01,327
He can not hurt.
Put that down.

178
00:21:17,245 --> 00:21:21,126
It's good.

179
00:21:22,175 --> 00:21:25,349
What do you know him?

180
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:29,524
I just met him tonight.
He ​​would...

181
00:21:30,063 --> 00:21:33,350
You're the freak last night.

182
00:21:39,638 --> 00:21:42,667
Beautiful.

183
00:21:48,192 --> 00:21:51,651
For the effort.
- And then your share?

184
00:21:52,229 --> 00:21:55,315
I was not even here.
- And the girl?

185
00:21:55,316 --> 00:21:58,115
She is waiting inside.

186
00:21:58,116 --> 00:22:01,669
Wish her a good night from me.

187
00:22:22,349 --> 00:22:24,595
He can.

188
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:35,554
What happened?
- I'd have been killed.

189
00:22:35,555 --> 00:22:37,833
It was all fixed.
- That I do not care.

190
00:22:37,834 --> 00:22:42,275
You do not look nearly
and had killed my boy. Rot now.

191
00:22:42,739 --> 00:22:46,831
I need this job.

192
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:50,020
I care that it pays for you.
I work twice as hard.

193
00:22:50,021 --> 00:22:52,528
This will never pay for me.

194
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:11,139
Now least you have time for coffee.

195
00:23:12,282 --> 00:23:16,766
Did you have anything to do?

196
00:23:17,381 --> 00:23:20,905
Of course not.
- I needed that job. I need money.

197
00:23:20,906 --> 00:23:23,760
Tell me what you need.

198
00:23:24,388 --> 00:23:27,606
What do you need?

199
00:23:29,701 --> 00:23:32,542
I thought I clearly was.
- That is correct.

200
00:23:32,543 --> 00:23:37,234
You're on the right path.
Every criminal says first.

201
00:23:38,858 --> 00:23:42,450
You're not every criminal.
You have skills.

202
00:23:42,451 --> 00:23:45,246
Skills that I can use.
- What are you talking about?

203
00:23:47,414 --> 00:23:50,861
I'm doing a scam thing.

204
00:23:51,668 --> 00:23:54,395
Not just scams.
I'm the perfect target.

205
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:58,217
For the Samaritan.

206
00:23:58,218 --> 00:24:00,815
Here I am talking about.

207
00:24:01,535 --> 00:24:04,291
Why you should join.

208
00:24:04,292 --> 00:24:08,978
It's your thing.
With you and my father.

209
00:24:09,641 --> 00:24:13,418
I am your father.
I want that are not.

210
00:24:20,012 --> 00:24:26,312
My mother is long been alone.

211
00:24:27,743 --> 00:24:33,816
When I was 17, she brought
the new guy to take home.

212
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,692
He takes us out to dinner...

213
00:24:36,693 --> 00:24:41,409
Orders a steak for me.
He ​​sees me as a man so...

214
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:45,696
Not as a boy.
And they say to me...

215
00:24:45,697 --> 00:24:48,505
They get married.

216
00:24:49,341 --> 00:24:52,589
What should I say?

217
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:55,431
I would like to have a father in
filthy body shops will...

218
00:24:55,432 --> 00:24:57,787
And smells like a urinal smells.

219
00:24:57,824 --> 00:25:00,728
So I eat my steak on.

220
00:25:01,412 --> 00:25:04,317
And I'm going to work.

221
00:25:04,318 --> 00:25:07,042
Phone calls late at night for the same
number on his phone bill.

222
00:25:07,044 --> 00:25:09,468
Motel Rooms are calculated on credit card.

223
00:25:09,469 --> 00:25:15,061
Of course I say nothing.

224
00:25:15,062 --> 00:25:17,860
Let mom only to find out.

225
00:25:17,861 --> 00:25:20,543
And when she finds out I'm on his side.

226
00:25:20,545 --> 00:25:23,555
Then I give him a shot, she also always

227
00:25:25,224 --> 00:25:29,665
Until I let a professional appearance
who says he owes her $ 200...

228
00:25:29,666 --> 00:25:32,672
For her abortion that he had undergone.

229
00:25:33,462 --> 00:25:37,864
The poor wretch.
He ​​had no idea what hit him.

230
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:43,900
But I knew I
son of my father.

231
00:25:45,506 --> 00:25:49,566
So yes, you're right.

232
00:25:50,686 --> 00:25:53,319
You're not my father.

233
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,363
But I have no father.

234
00:25:56,999 --> 00:26:00,059
I need a partner.

235
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:04,569
Did your mother never found someone else?
- What?

236
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:08,446
No.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

237
00:26:09,674 --> 00:26:13,332
You have no idea what I can do for you.

238
00:26:16,129 --> 00:26:19,657
Stay away from me.

239
00:26:26,983 --> 00:26:31,300
Yet suffered from last night?
- On this side nothing.

240
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:36,606
No police, no Jake, but she is
every night of the week visited.

241
00:26:37,955 --> 00:26:40,572
I was just leaving.

242
00:26:41,332 --> 00:26:44,436
You're going nowhere.

243
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,490
I owe you an apology.

244
00:26:49,491 --> 00:26:51,990
That I called you a creep.

245
00:26:52,529 --> 00:26:55,568
Sorry.
- Excuse accepted.

246
00:26:59,256 --> 00:27:02,065
In any case, thanks.

247
00:27:02,066 --> 00:27:05,025
I've been raped and that's no fun.

248
00:27:06,211 --> 00:27:10,186
What?
- You make it come on thick.

249
00:27:10,188 --> 00:27:15,098
I do not know if you captivates me or that I fear you must be

250
00:27:15,833 --> 00:27:19,721
Beguiled.

251
00:27:23,339 --> 00:27:27,529
Is that it?
I buy a bottle of liquor of your choice?

252
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:31,746
And you do not even try to get in my pants?

253
00:27:35,068 --> 00:27:39,355
Good.
Try this.

254
00:27:39,356 --> 00:27:43,043
Ask me again how my day was.

255
00:27:43,353 --> 00:27:47,778
How was your day?
- Kloten. And yours?

256
00:27:47,997 --> 00:27:51,208
Kloten.
- See?

257
00:27:51,209 --> 00:27:56,860
Conversation.
- Sorry, I have not practiced much.

258
00:27:56,861 --> 00:28:00,566
I love a chat. Or a pathetic story than

259
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:05,573
My wife does not understand me.
You remind me of my first girlfriend thought.

260
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:08,667
I have no wife.

261
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:13,879
Girlfriend then.
- I have no girlfriend.

262
00:28:15,508 --> 00:28:20,065
I have no family, no home, no dog.

263
00:28:20,066 --> 00:28:22,953
I have no friends.

264
00:28:22,954 --> 00:28:27,708
I have nothing.
Absolutely nothing.

265
00:28:36,072 --> 00:28:38,866
I really do not.

266
00:28:39,859 --> 00:28:44,183
My parents died when I was two.
I remember them.

267
00:28:45,582 --> 00:28:50,105
I was raised by my
alcoholic bastard of a grandmother.

268
00:28:50,742 --> 00:28:54,277
Until I could get out of there.

269
00:28:55,105 --> 00:28:59,694
Anyone who ever gave me
is dead.

270
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:05,708
My grandmother lives probably because I hate her.

271
00:29:07,914 --> 00:29:11,715
Do you think that's funny?
- A little bit.

272
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:15,000
Do you have something better?

273
00:29:16,651 --> 00:29:20,585
Last week I came to prison.

274
00:29:20,586 --> 00:29:24,268
After 25 years have been, because I
my best friend got killed.

275
00:29:24,532 --> 00:29:31,532
Everyone I ever cared about is dead or nearly dead...

276
00:29:31,701 --> 00:29:34,423
Or wish I was dead.

277
00:29:36,361 --> 00:29:42,587
Yes, you are certainly more pathetic than I am.

278
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:50,101
I really think about you
to take a good fucking.

279
00:29:50,137 --> 00:29:54,512
And if I do not want that now?

280
00:29:56,078 --> 00:30:01,095
In case you are on your head too often
beaten, I will be very clear.

281
00:30:01,371 --> 00:30:04,707
This is your big chance.

282
00:30:24,037 --> 00:30:27,517
I'll tell you when it's time
for you to do something.

283
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:54,936
You may kiss me now.

284
00:31:51,756 --> 00:31:54,749
Here to hear there.

285
00:31:57,951 --> 00:32:02,135
I've tried a few times
suicide.

286
00:32:04,295 --> 00:32:07,430
Do you do upset?

287
00:32:09,908 --> 00:32:12,642
I'm glad you're not successful.

288
00:32:19,035 --> 00:32:21,740
I am a junkie.

289
00:32:21,741 --> 00:32:24,772
Do you do upset?

290
00:32:29,887 --> 00:32:34,640
I'm a murderer.
Do you do upset?

291
00:32:34,667 --> 00:32:39,070
I can not remember the last time
I did something I was proud.

292
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:42,103
I know what you mean.

293
00:32:46,417 --> 00:32:51,514
I think you understand.

294
00:32:52,549 --> 00:32:55,785
Nothing changes unless you change it.

295
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:59,565
Yes, I know how that sounds.

296
00:32:59,566 --> 00:33:02,562
Every morning I woke up in jail

297
00:33:02,584 --> 00:33:05,577
I thought about what that really meant.

298
00:33:06,394 --> 00:33:09,705
Listen.

299
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,808
I must go to the toilet.

300
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:15,528
I need to use.

301
00:33:15,529 --> 00:33:18,264
Otherwise  I climb up the wall.

302
00:33:19,957 --> 00:33:23,246
You can leave if you want.
I understand that.

303
00:33:34,052 --> 00:33:37,156
You do not close the door to do.

304
00:35:04,297 --> 00:35:07,975
How many of those places you've ever been?

305
00:35:08,032 --> 00:35:10,964
You know.
Not.

306
00:35:10,965 --> 00:35:13,614
Not ?
- I bought them in a bookstore.

307
00:35:13,615 --> 00:35:16,942
And then read about places I
I never could afford.

308
00:35:16,993 --> 00:35:19,248
And chips that I could never afford to eat

309
00:35:19,249 --> 00:35:23,600
Now if you could go to India...
- Brazil

310
00:35:23,745 --> 00:35:26,954
Absolutely.

311
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:32,320
I would fly to Rio and then
16,000 km along the coast to Macio.

312
00:35:32,321 --> 00:35:36,350
So I...

313
00:35:37,021 --> 00:35:41,965
This could see.
- Why Rio?

314
00:35:44,161 --> 00:35:47,935
Because
seems to me that the place where you can forget everything.

315
00:35:48,013 --> 00:35:51,946
You are doing well.

316
00:35:51,947 --> 00:35:55,468
I was worried about.
- Yeah, me too.

317
00:35:57,093 --> 00:36:00,121
I want you to come and live here.

318
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:15,633
Welcome home.

319
00:36:17,357 --> 00:36:20,169
It smells good here.

320
00:36:22,489 --> 00:36:25,967
What is it?

321
00:36:25,968 --> 00:36:30,927
It feels like this is real.

322
00:36:30,928 --> 00:36:34,173
If we build a life here.

323
00:36:34,174 --> 00:36:36,560
We do the same.

324
00:36:39,916 --> 00:36:42,869
Then we need to clarify things.

325
00:36:51,774 --> 00:36:54,999
That evening in the Apo A
Wau with that guy.

326
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:59,464
Then you came not so coincidentally show up.

327
00:36:59,643 --> 00:37:03,441
What are you talking about?

328
00:37:03,442 --> 00:37:06,256
Ethan had sent you yet?

329
00:37:08,839 --> 00:37:12,231
Do you know this all along?

330
00:37:12,232 --> 00:37:15,074
I had sometimes thought.

331
00:37:24,839 --> 00:37:28,173
I owed him money.

332
00:37:28,942 --> 00:37:31,604
More than I can afford.

333
00:37:31,605 --> 00:37:34,635
He said if I would go to bed with you
that we were even.

334
00:37:35,322 --> 00:37:39,627
I had already done this before.
Not very often.

335
00:37:39,838 --> 00:37:42,137
Twice.

336
00:37:42,138 --> 00:37:45,122
That I do not care.
- I think so.

337
00:37:47,275 --> 00:37:51,195
I said I would look at
and then decide.

338
00:37:51,196 --> 00:37:53,968
I did so as if I had a choice.

339
00:37:53,969 --> 00:37:58,739
Jake decided that I was a whore but
and that he could get free.

340
00:37:58,751 --> 00:38:02,940
I lay on the bathroom floor and thought...

341
00:38:03,203 --> 00:38:06,268
This is the end for me.

342
00:38:06,269 --> 00:38:10,805
On my knee for an asshole.

343
00:38:12,128 --> 00:38:15,143
And when you walked inside.

344
00:38:17,051 --> 00:38:20,569
After you left I told Ethan...

345
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:24,588
I would find a way to bring him back
to pay, but I did not do what he wanted.

346
00:38:27,534 --> 00:38:32,381
Through him I went to that bar.

347
00:38:33,351 --> 00:38:37,222
But all my senses were focused on you.

348
00:38:48,126 --> 00:38:51,687
I just wanted the truth.

349
00:39:08,356 --> 00:39:13,155
I'm sorry.
- Promise that you'll never lie to me.

350
00:39:13,334 --> 00:39:17,185
I promise you the same.
- I promise.

351
00:39:17,186 --> 00:39:21,109
And I'm sorry.
- I do not.

352
00:39:34,905 --> 00:39:37,752
3602.

353
00:39:39,814 --> 00:39:44,292
Come inside. Do you drink?
- We need to talk business.

354
00:39:46,299 --> 00:39:49,005
You will finally become partners.
This is good news.

355
00:39:49,006 --> 00:39:52,560
You misunderstand me.
You and I will never work together.

356
00:39:52,561 --> 00:39:55,493
Never say never.
- I am here because of Iris.

357
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:58,638
I know what's going on.

358
00:39:58,639 --> 00:40:02,797
Is that so?
- Yes.

359
00:40:03,024 --> 00:40:07,078
I do not know, Foley.

360
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:10,521
I have good eye on you.

361
00:40:10,522 --> 00:40:14,942
And I think you know nothing.

362
00:40:15,047 --> 00:40:20,168
I think in fact that you do
have no idea.

363
00:40:21,995 --> 00:40:26,338
Jake know you do not you?
- He knows you certainly did.

364
00:40:34,333 --> 00:40:37,120
I'm sorry.

365
00:40:37,253 --> 00:40:40,376
But Jake was pretty pissed at you.

366
00:40:41,751 --> 00:40:46,079
So now...

367
00:40:47,934 --> 00:40:53,249
Jake sits in a car
Iris in her apartment.

368
00:40:53,294 --> 00:40:57,172
If I do not call him in ten minutes,
he goes to the top...

369
00:40:57,173 --> 00:41:01,414
Then he fucks her turn her head
together with a stick.

370
00:41:01,887 --> 00:41:05,422
Or maybe he saves her head in between
and he fucks her.

371
00:41:07,326 --> 00:41:12,016
Think I forgive you
that you have killed my father?

372
00:41:13,517 --> 00:41:20,624
That you wanted.
And I know exactly how you go into debt problems.

373
00:41:23,715 --> 00:41:26,838
You will earn eight million for me.

374
00:41:27,447 --> 00:41:30,134
Eight million is the price for the ball...

375
00:41:30,135 --> 00:41:33,717
You in the head your best friend's lap,
to save yourself.

376
00:41:33,718 --> 00:41:37,335
Listen to me.
- No, listen to me.

377
00:41:38,292 --> 00:41:41,585
I have a target.

378
00:41:41,586 --> 00:41:46,000
Ready for use.

379
00:41:46,104 --> 00:41:49,624
But he does it the old fashioned way.

380
00:41:49,625 --> 00:41:54,329
So I have someone with him to his old ways
from their money.

381
00:41:54,330 --> 00:41:56,795
You want me to get back
only for what I did.

382
00:41:56,796 --> 00:42:00,472
This is about what you will do
and I exactly what I say.

383
00:42:00,473 --> 00:42:09,122
Do I care that Iris learn something about you,
that they really do not want to know.

384
00:42:12,652 --> 00:42:17,876
We told each other everything.
If you can not catch me taking.

385
00:42:17,877 --> 00:42:19,949
We have no secrets.

386
00:42:33,398 --> 00:42:36,676
You need to know a secret,
a secret to tell.

387
00:42:41,961 --> 00:42:47,543
Your old girlfriend Tess Armstrong said
you think they had a little problem rectified.

388
00:42:47,801 --> 00:42:50,450
That's what she kept.

389
00:42:50,451 --> 00:42:54,447
Do I have a child?

390
00:42:56,799 --> 00:42:59,550
You're so accustomed to thinking in miniature.

391
00:42:59,551 --> 00:43:03,306
All those years cooped up in that little jail cell.

392
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:08,305
And in that small apartment where your father and mother played...

393
00:43:09,651 --> 00:43:13,539
You're the one who is fooled.

394
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:23,636
She's your daughter.

395
00:43:23,637 --> 00:43:30,386
Iris...

396
00:43:30,388 --> 00:43:34,568
Your daughter.
- No.

397
00:43:34,569 --> 00:43:39,563
Your precious little girl.

398
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,908
I should shoot you because you said something.

399
00:43:43,909 --> 00:43:46,864
She's your daughter.
- That is a lie.

400
00:43:46,901 --> 00:43:52,233
When you met Iris, your own flesh and blood,
you had no idea.

401
00:43:52,234 --> 00:43:57,337
No idea.
It was priceless.

402
00:43:57,719 --> 00:44:02,632
If you kill me now, what then?

403
00:44:02,633 --> 00:44:06,054
How long do you think the police need that
has to find out?

404
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:10,660
No, you do everything I tell you.

405
00:44:11,939 --> 00:44:13,773
You know all the secrets of Iris.

406
00:44:13,774 --> 00:44:17,917
So you know they
with a razor has been working.

407
00:44:17,954 --> 00:44:23,607
I wonder how she feels when she knows them all the time
that was fucking...

408
00:44:27,469 --> 00:44:31,818
This is the last time you do that.

409
00:44:34,565 --> 00:44:37,747
I almost pity you.

410
00:44:37,851 --> 00:44:41,304
After all these years your targets
grazing take...

411
00:44:42,264 --> 00:44:45,742
Who is now the target?

412
00:44:48,055 --> 00:44:52,261
You have six minutes to decisions.

413
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:17,003
Call him.
- Excellent decision.

414
00:45:26,308 --> 00:45:31,809
He does not answer.
- Give your car keys.

415
00:45:32,834 --> 00:45:35,823
If he touched her...

416
00:45:35,824 --> 00:45:38,526
Swallowed, but suicide.

417
00:46:16,611 --> 00:46:20,095
Did you miss me?

418
00:46:33,112 --> 00:46:38,005
See that?
This is Foley. An eye for an eye.

419
00:47:01,758 --> 00:47:07,645
Are you okay? It's all right.
Listen...

420
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:11,007
I need him out of here and then I must lay low...

421
00:47:11,122 --> 00:47:13,941
In case there are problems, ok?
- You mean "we" must keep our heads down...

422
00:47:14,056 --> 00:47:17,497
You and I together.
- No, it's smarter to be kept separate.

423
00:47:17,612 --> 00:47:19,805
What has happened with Ethan?
- I've arranged.

424
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,136
What does that mean?
- It means that I regularly have...

425
00:47:22,251 --> 00:47:24,650
You have nothing to do with him.

426
00:47:25,125 --> 00:47:27,795
What is going on?
- Nothing.

427
00:47:28,245 --> 00:47:32,814
Listen, Iris,
I can not go back to prison.

428
00:47:32,929 --> 00:47:38,091
I need him out of here before the police come
. Say nothing to anyone.

429
00:47:38,192 --> 00:47:43,272
I have no one to tell the opposite.
You are the one to whom I tell everything.

430
00:47:47,355 --> 00:47:49,193
Come on.

431
00:47:56,902 --> 00:47:59,661
Xavier makes you wonder.

432
00:48:01,968 --> 00:48:07,701
This is the man in 3602.
His car is at the usual place.

433
00:48:32,386 --> 00:48:35,836
Celia?
- You are old.

434
00:48:40,809 --> 00:48:42,935
You look the same.

435
00:48:43,181 --> 00:48:47,308
Parent, but the same.
- Celia, I have a daughter?

436
00:48:49,083 --> 00:48:51,676
How did you find out?

437
00:48:58,811 --> 00:49:03,065
You have been in prison.
Tess wanted from you.

438
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:10,730
When she died,
I respected her decision.

439
00:49:11,845 --> 00:49:15,827
What Tess said
to her child about who her father was?

440
00:49:16,772 --> 00:49:22,162
They said he died in a car accident.
By that time, Tess sick.

441
00:49:22,296 --> 00:49:26,660
Children do not ask questions when their world falls apart.

442
00:49:30,328 --> 00:49:32,479
Listen, Foley...

443
00:49:32,748 --> 00:49:35,336
She is better off thinking that you're dead.

444
00:49:35,453 --> 00:49:40,680
I know that it is difficult to hear,
but she now has a life.

445
00:49:40,764 --> 00:49:45,250
She does not know what kind of people they descended.

446
00:49:51,439 --> 00:49:57,198
Would you like to tell me her name?
I'm not looking for her, I want to just know.

447
00:49:58,804 --> 00:50:00,738
Iris...

448
00:50:01,264 --> 00:50:03,569
Her name is Iris.

449
00:50:05,271 --> 00:50:07,413
Thank you, Celia.

450
00:50:48,321 --> 00:50:53,070
What do you do? Get away from my house.
- What have you told me about Ethan? What?

451
00:50:53,184 --> 00:50:55,751
Who do you think did this to me?

452
00:50:56,632 --> 00:50:59,270
Jesus, Foley,
what has he done to you?

453
00:50:59,865 --> 00:51:02,456
I'm sorry.

454
00:51:42,845 --> 00:51:45,247
You a week.

455
00:51:45,891 --> 00:51:50,542
None damn word to let me know that you
was alive, but you regret?

456
00:51:50,706 --> 00:51:53,174
I have half my life spent
in prison.

457
00:51:53,288 --> 00:51:56,913
If you sit there, decisions
for you.

458
00:51:57,027 --> 00:52:01,165
Everything here is new to me.
There are things I need to put in a row.

459
00:52:01,304 --> 00:52:05,339
And to do that I need time.
Time...

460
00:52:05,670 --> 00:52:08,734
Some time away from here.
A little while...

461
00:52:09,751 --> 00:52:11,840
Away from you.

462
00:52:13,944 --> 00:52:16,029
You're lying.

463
00:52:16,323 --> 00:52:20,183
We had promised 'no lies'.
I know when you lie.

464
00:52:20,298 --> 00:52:25,445
You can give me just as well tell the truth.
- That's the truth. You must trust me.

465
00:52:26,538 --> 00:52:30,774
We currently can not interact.

466
00:52:30,888 --> 00:52:35,758
It would be best if you left.
I can not tell you why.

467
00:52:36,451 --> 00:52:39,886
If I had not have been necessary
I would not ask.

468
00:52:40,001 --> 00:52:43,276
You want me to trust you, but you do not trust me
agree with the truth.

469
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:45,841
If I were to say that the
to protect you, would you say...

470
00:52:45,956 --> 00:52:47,965
You do to protect yourself.
- I could do that.

471
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:52,471
I know. And I also know that every
lie discovered in each story that I tell you.

472
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:58,589
You should be the one to whom I can always tell the truth...

473
00:53:00,659 --> 00:53:02,575
But I can not.

474
00:53:03,249 --> 00:53:06,448
And I ask you again, please...

475
00:53:06,563 --> 00:53:08,657
Trust me.

476
00:53:10,458 --> 00:53:14,148
Let's just leave.
We are going to a place where it is hot, with beaches...

477
00:53:14,263 --> 00:53:18,914
And fat tourists we can light up.
I will plan everything to perfection.

478
00:53:20,381 --> 00:53:23,149
The only thing you need to do is
say yes.

479
00:53:23,549 --> 00:53:30,204
I can give you money. Just take it to
and go as far as possible. Tell me where.

480
00:53:31,898 --> 00:53:36,707
For how long?
- A couple of weeks, maybe a month.

481
00:53:37,626 --> 00:53:39,436
Or longer...

482
00:53:40,248 --> 00:53:42,293
Or never.

483
00:53:42,408 --> 00:53:45,612
No, sweetie.
Not 'never'.

484
00:53:49,788 --> 00:53:51,587
Iris?

485
00:54:22,768 --> 00:54:24,816
I need your help.

486
00:54:24,931 --> 00:54:27,517
I got myself into trouble.
I have done nothing...

487
00:54:27,621 --> 00:54:30,059
But not something I can shake off of me.

488
00:54:30,173 --> 00:54:33,903
What are we talking about?
- A local man, moved many products.

489
00:54:34,018 --> 00:54:36,171
Should be a great catch.

490
00:54:36,625 --> 00:54:41,144
Are you now an informant?
- You're my probation officer, or not?

491
00:54:41,258 --> 00:54:44,024
Is this not what I am supposed to do?

492
00:54:58,048 --> 00:55:00,556
With Deacon.
- Did you get?

493
00:55:01,884 --> 00:55:04,443
Yes, he's here.

494
00:55:09,257 --> 00:55:12,310
Yes?
- You do not have criminal mastermind to...

495
00:55:12,425 --> 00:55:16,035
<i> to some guy to pay off.
You've already made some mistake, Foley. </ I>

496
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:18,682
<i> If you have further makes
you're dead. </ I>

497
00:55:18,797 --> 00:55:21,805
<i> Tonight I want my answer . </ i>

498
00:55:40,009 --> 00:55:42,270
I go upstairs.

499
00:55:55,082 --> 00:55:58,360
20, 19...

500
00:55:58,475 --> 00:56:02,451
14, 13, 12...

501
00:56:02,566 --> 00:56:06,475
11, 10, 9...

502
00:56:06,590 --> 00:56:10,246
Congratulations.
The good news?

503
00:56:10,370 --> 00:56:14,946
You have a very good cardiovascular system.

504
00:56:17,095 --> 00:56:19,271
The bad news...

505
00:56:19,386 --> 00:56:23,018
Is that bad things I've learned
in prison.

506
00:56:23,133 --> 00:56:28,973
Did you know that a small knife
can do as much damage as a large knife?

507
00:56:32,298 --> 00:56:34,957
This example...

508
00:56:35,072 --> 00:56:37,502
I use him for cutting fruit...

509
00:56:37,616 --> 00:56:41,087
But when I press this...

510
00:56:42,415 --> 00:56:45,958
And a 2.5 cm long incision make...

511
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:49,298
You will bleed to death in two minutes.

512
00:56:49,436 --> 00:56:51,481
Listen, Foley.
- No, you listen.

513
00:56:51,603 --> 00:56:55,097
If we merge these scams cops,
you must promise me two things.

514
00:56:55,212 --> 00:56:58,705
Val die anyway, Foley.
You have no control here. Snap not you?

515
00:57:04,348 --> 00:57:07,249
These are my terms:

516
00:57:07,364 --> 00:57:10,914
First:
Iris...

517
00:57:11,029 --> 00:57:14,494
Will never hear about what you told me.

518
00:57:14,609 --> 00:57:17,378
If you even give a hint about...

519
00:57:17,493 --> 00:57:20,620
I will murder you. Do you understand?
- Yes.

520
00:57:20,735 --> 00:57:26,645
Second: If we run these scams
you my orders to the details follow...

521
00:57:26,759 --> 00:57:30,066
No exception. Understood?
- Yes.

522
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:35,760
You do not sound convincing.
- Yes, I understand, absolutely.

523
00:57:38,278 --> 00:57:40,020
Come on.

524
00:57:43,084 --> 00:57:46,740
Should we be concerned that we be disturbed?
- No, do not worry.

525
00:57:46,854 --> 00:57:48,652
The clinic closes at 7 pm...

526
00:57:48,767 --> 00:57:52,807
And I stay here at night to make sure
of junkies that there is no hack.

527
00:57:52,922 --> 00:57:57,393
Are you  actually be a doctor?
Will I be attached by a conc you?

528
00:57:57,508 --> 00:58:00,807
In Serbia? I was a surgeon, here
I am a watchman.

529
00:58:00,922 --> 00:58:04,747
Miro knows what he does. He gave me enough
patched in prison.

530
00:58:04,862 --> 00:58:06,817
You have saved me hundreds of times.

531
00:58:06,932 --> 00:58:11,337
I owe you.
- Take no memories.

532
00:58:11,452 --> 00:58:13,952
Just make it down.

533
00:58:15,077 --> 00:58:17,049
I have taken precautions.

534
00:58:17,050 --> 00:58:19,907
If I am disabled,
two things happen:

535
00:58:20,576 --> 00:58:24,003
The cops find Jake
with your DNA on it.

536
00:58:24,118 --> 00:58:28,013
And would Iris' t know
about her long-lost dad.

537
00:58:28,167 --> 00:58:32,182
Where you have hidden her, she can
be found.

538
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:40,946
This is what I need:

539
00:58:41,061 --> 00:58:43,706
A high quality hotel room to get in shape...

540
00:58:43,707 --> 00:58:45,669
And I the details of the scam may develop.

541
00:58:46,886 --> 00:58:53,774
I have a wife as bait.
Prefers older, with experience.

542
00:58:53,889 --> 00:58:57,340
I have a male IT needs,
international accounts that can open...

543
00:58:57,455 --> 00:58:59,551
And me through the technical section can lock

544
00:58:59,666 --> 00:59:02,440
And I have a residence place needs
to the scam.

545
00:59:02,555 --> 00:59:07,906
Preferably a house.
Large, expensive, and you oleerd.

546
00:59:08,021 --> 00:59:14,480
Awesome. This is exactly what I mean partner.
- We are not partners, Ethan.

547
00:59:14,594 --> 00:59:17,170
I once my partner.

548
00:59:17,909 --> 00:59:19,930
I killed him.

549
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:37,217
You look good, Foley.

550
01:00:37,506 --> 01:00:42,548
Let me introduce you to your wife, Helena.
Helena, this is your husband.

551
01:00:42,662 --> 01:00:45,304
Well, new spouse.

552
01:00:51,917 --> 01:00:56,062
So you know how this scam works?
- Yes. Well, the first half of it.

553
01:00:56,177 --> 01:01:00,030
Ethan is the insider, you're the outsider
and I am the bait.

554
01:01:00,145 --> 01:01:01,900
And drug addict woman some rich dude.

555
01:01:01,902 --> 01:01:04,166
The project developer.

556
01:01:06,221 --> 01:01:07,990
The long-term work is finished.

557
01:01:07,991 --> 01:01:10,697
Six months ago, someone stole some money from the target.

558
01:01:10,801 --> 01:01:15,930
250 grand.
- And whosoever was not there anymore.

559
01:01:16,045 --> 01:01:18,665
But he had an accomplice...

560
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:20,492
I.

561
01:01:20,607 --> 01:01:23,808
I say to the target: "Are you stupid bastard who
are you lit up..."

562
01:01:23,809 --> 01:01:25,894
let her 't tell.

563
01:01:26,531 --> 01:01:30,951
Ethan takes me to the target and says:
"It was not my fault, it was not my idea."

564
01:01:31,066 --> 01:01:35,988
250 grand stolen during a drug deal,
the target wants his money now.

565
01:01:36,102 --> 01:01:41,242
But I only way to pay;
my rich husband, Neil.

566
01:01:41,357 --> 01:01:45,853
See? I told you that she is a pro,
she knows what to do.

567
01:01:45,967 --> 01:01:49,150
I know what I should do,
but who is the target?

568
01:01:58,579 --> 01:02:01,014
Are you out of your head?

569
01:02:01,128 --> 01:02:03,691
You never told me that we go to Xavier cops.

570
01:02:03,806 --> 01:02:05,767
What you gonna do, bitch?

571
01:02:05,769 --> 01:02:09,132
Are you suddenly in a position that allows you
just walk away?

572
01:02:10,755 --> 01:02:13,848
H? disrespecteer her.

573
01:02:13,963 --> 01:02:17,198
If we dealt with the case are
depend our lives apart.

574
01:02:17,312 --> 01:02:20,750
Or should I remind you
the promise you made?

575
01:02:21,947 --> 01:02:23,625
My apologies.

576
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:28,332
Are you 100% sure,
that this money can not be traced?

577
01:02:28,446 --> 01:02:32,048
Twice a year flies Xavier
here to make sure that his money was laundered...

578
01:02:32,163 --> 01:02:35,486
And spread to 'clean' accounts.
That he always does in person.

579
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:37,137
But it is such a greedy asshole...

580
01:02:37,252 --> 01:02:39,619
That if he finds out that he can get an additional percentage
...

581
01:02:39,734 --> 01:02:43,394
By someone to cheat,
I guarantee you he will do it.

582
01:02:45,389 --> 01:02:49,627
The scam is not about the taking of someone's money

583
01:02:49,742 --> 01:02:52,223
It's about gaining confidence.

584
01:02:52,338 --> 01:02:56,549
The important thing is to set up a situation where even
the target knows...

585
01:02:56,664 --> 01:03:01,263
That he is being cheated, but he still thinks
done him a favor.

586
01:03:01,377 --> 01:03:04,324
If he leads the scam.

587
01:03:06,017 --> 01:03:09,004
Why it's called 'The Samaritan'.

588
01:03:16,754 --> 01:03:18,647
Yes?

589
01:03:18,912 --> 01:03:20,876
I'm Helena.

590
01:03:40,825 --> 01:03:43,836
I wanted to thank you for...

591
01:03:44,508 --> 01:03:47,831
Not be an asshole.

592
01:03:47,946 --> 01:03:49,882
No thanks.

593
01:03:52,498 --> 01:03:54,891
Do you have something to drink?

594
01:04:02,332 --> 01:04:04,588
Ethan Has sent you?

595
01:04:08,043 --> 01:04:11,048
Rot anyway, I'm not a whore.

596
01:04:13,483 --> 01:04:15,308
I'm sorry.

597
01:04:15,423 --> 01:04:18,486
I am here because I like to look at you.

598
01:04:19,691 --> 01:04:23,078
Like you said;
if it fails...

599
01:04:24,425 --> 01:04:26,768
Is that our death.

600
01:04:39,705 --> 01:04:42,992
This is not part of the scam.

601
01:04:45,237 --> 01:04:47,481
What do you, Helen?

602
01:04:49,759 --> 01:04:54,096
I know who Ethan is, but I do not know
who you are and why you are here.

603
01:04:54,211 --> 01:04:58,064
I did it the old fashioned way and you do
choke, but you were acting...

604
01:04:58,231 --> 01:05:02,295
Professional,
so I had to just ask.

605
01:05:02,694 --> 01:05:04,954
It is rude.

606
01:05:09,944 --> 01:05:12,541
So Ethan has you too?

607
01:05:13,129 --> 01:05:15,694
Completely in the rod.

608
01:05:18,758 --> 01:05:22,272
Do you really think that if 't we manage our
he just...

609
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:26,467
Pays off and let us go?
- I do not know.

610
01:05:28,852 --> 01:05:32,152
But I think he keeps coming back and...

611
01:05:33,586 --> 01:05:36,459
Takes and takes and takes.

612
01:05:48,076 --> 01:05:50,162
We'll get through it.

613
01:05:50,276 --> 01:05:52,597
There is no we, Foley.

614
01:05:54,844 --> 01:05:58,199
If you feel differently
end up dead.

615
01:06:05,211 --> 01:06:10,366
Is this like a place with a smooth janus
a developer would build for himself?

616
01:06:10,481 --> 01:06:12,761
How far is this from the club down?
- 17 minutes.

617
01:06:12,876 --> 01:06:15,694
Exactly 17 minutes?
- Trust me, I'm timed.

618
01:06:15,809 --> 01:06:20,076
And before you say something, I'm night
at the right time to ride.

619
01:06:20,548 --> 01:06:24,070
Over 12 o'clock the last detail.

620
01:06:25,781 --> 01:06:29,584
Are you really sure that Xavier
self drive around here?

621
01:06:29,699 --> 01:06:34,065
I know 'm He gets aroused it to me to show you how
something the right way to do it.

622
01:06:34,180 --> 01:06:39,241
If I am too rough with Helena, he gets
intervene and take control of the situation.

623
01:06:58,643 --> 01:07:02,143
Come inside.
- We come too late to Helena to pick up.

624
01:07:02,373 --> 01:07:05,368
What is this? Did you have 
of your club broads?

625
01:07:05,510 --> 01:07:10,224
Why I wanted to see you first,
for you to motivate for the big show.

626
01:07:10,387 --> 01:07:13,106
Come down and say hello.

627
01:07:18,892 --> 01:07:20,750
Hi.

628
01:07:25,661 --> 01:07:28,006
You thought you were rid of me, huh?

629
01:07:28,121 --> 01:07:30,833
I could not figure out why you lied

630
01:07:30,948 --> 01:07:32,849
I just had to know why...

631
01:07:33,750 --> 01:07:36,425
But I never thought you would show me
off for money.

632
01:07:37,332 --> 01:07:41,607
I do not know where you think you are doing.
- You can no longer tell me what to do.

633
01:07:41,722 --> 01:07:43,711
I've cleaned up.

634
01:07:43,825 --> 01:07:47,539
I have quarreled.
I have done everything the right way...

635
01:07:47,654 --> 01:07:51,425
But you wanted me out of the way
to continue with the scam.

636
01:07:51,539 --> 01:07:54,999
You're the true addict, Foley,
I do not.

637
01:07:55,114 --> 01:07:58,281
I need to talk to you privately.
- Everything you told me to say...

638
01:07:58,396 --> 01:08:00,604
Can you say in front of him.

639
01:08:07,552 --> 01:08:09,792
Luck tonight.

640
01:08:10,770 --> 01:08:12,979
Come home rich.

641
01:08:16,342 --> 01:08:18,736
Are you ready to work?

642
01:08:30,109 --> 01:08:32,745
I have no other choice.
It is my pledge...

643
01:08:32,860 --> 01:08:36,905
Just in case you at the last moment a change in
plan is.

644
01:08:38,632 --> 01:08:40,509
She just keeps clinging?

645
01:08:40,624 --> 01:08:43,856
I'm trying to find out how her
I can get away from me, but then what?

646
01:08:43,971 --> 01:08:46,212
What are you doing?
Do you stay with her?

647
01:08:46,326 --> 01:08:51,912
Maybe you can just be friends.
- Ethan, stop talking.

648
01:09:04,050 --> 01:09:05,928
Helena.

649
01:09:09,769 --> 01:09:12,582
Helena, you better be ready.

650
01:09:20,430 --> 01:09:22,510
Sloppy bitch.

651
01:09:44,625 --> 01:09:47,159
Val DEATH - bitch.

652
01:09:47,372 --> 01:09:52,289
Probably she had this long planned, but she waited
right time for me to sew.

653
01:09:56,722 --> 01:10:01,494
The woman is dead, Ethan.
- Yes, and I'm good long cry...

654
01:10:01,609 --> 01:10:06,402
When you told me how to fix this.
- We will not it dissolve.

655
01:10:06,517 --> 01:10:10,443
This is a triple swindle;
husband, wife, dealer.

656
01:10:10,557 --> 01:10:14,076
All about the bait.
No bait, no scam.

657
01:10:14,190 --> 01:10:17,237
The target arrives on about three hours.

658
01:10:17,352 --> 01:10:20,551
We have no more time.
- You must know someone from the past.

659
01:10:20,665 --> 01:10:23,286
I can call Gretchen, but
finger you cut...

660
01:10:23,401 --> 01:10:27,140
Might betray that they are not addicted wife of a developer is

661
01:10:27,254 --> 01:10:31,186
Ga sew it yourself.
- I have you all done well. Also sew yourself.

662
01:10:40,848 --> 01:10:42,501
No.

663
01:10:42,616 --> 01:10:45,759
We need bait.
- There is nothing in that.

664
01:10:45,874 --> 01:10:48,398
Is she not smart enough,
good enough, fast enough?

665
01:10:48,513 --> 01:10:51,095
What she does not know what Helena had?
- Will not happen.

666
01:10:51,131 --> 01:10:53,091
It's not your decision.

667
01:10:53,205 --> 01:10:57,205
Do I still have a choice? Or should I let meewaaien
but with the wind?

668
01:10:57,320 --> 01:10:59,549
Yes, of course you have a choice.

669
01:10:59,664 --> 01:11:05,300
We split 60, 20, 20, which is
1.6 million for you. What do you say?

670
01:11:05,896 --> 01:11:08,079
Yes.
-will never work.

671
01:11:08,193 --> 01:11:10,166
You know I can t.

672
01:11:10,946 --> 01:11:13,641
Or is it your wife that I should play?

673
01:11:14,751 --> 01:11:19,035
Right, the target must be really stupid
to believe that I am your wife...

674
01:11:19,703 --> 01:11:22,008
But I could be your daughter.

675
01:11:26,285 --> 01:11:28,426
The scam has a coke-addicted woman needs...

676
01:11:28,541 --> 01:11:31,287
Who plays dirty behind the back of her husband, right?

677
01:11:31,402 --> 01:11:34,749
But it might as well be
a daughter who sniff Daddy's money.

678
01:11:34,864 --> 01:11:36,726
She's right.
- Listen...

679
01:11:36,841 --> 01:11:40,196
It's not that your not pretty enough,
fast enough or smart enough...

680
01:11:40,311 --> 01:11:43,879
You're just not ready, and we have no time to
you ready for it.

681
01:11:43,994 --> 01:11:46,738
You know the terms are not the backups, and equipment not

682
01:11:46,853 --> 01:11:48,886
If you make a mistake you chase us all killed.

683
01:11:49,003 --> 01:11:52,180
There are worse things than being murdered.
I think you know it.

684
01:11:52,310 --> 01:11:54,477
How much do you owe?
- What?

685
01:11:54,592 --> 01:11:59,255
I want to know how deep this is
that you would want to commit suicide...

686
01:11:59,369 --> 01:12:01,732
To get out, like your dad.

687
01:12:03,961 --> 01:12:06,162
We can do this.

688
01:12:11,350 --> 01:12:13,318
It's over.

689
01:12:16,768 --> 01:12:18,819
I need this.

690
01:12:19,008 --> 01:12:22,876
I can take part and go far away.

691
01:12:22,991 --> 01:12:25,435
Do not you think I deserve that?

692
01:12:25,557 --> 01:12:29,440
Come with me.
- You do not want to join, ok?

693
01:12:29,530 --> 01:12:32,272
Bugger. It continues.

694
01:12:32,392 --> 01:12:34,664
Out with me right now.

695
01:12:34,779 --> 01:12:36,830
Do not listen to him.
- No, do not listen to me...

696
01:12:36,936 --> 01:12:39,642
I try us all just rich.

697
01:12:42,631 --> 01:12:44,418
I stay.

698
01:13:07,062 --> 01:13:10,880
Everything I touch goes fucked.

699
01:13:11,477 --> 01:13:14,063
How do you think that is?

700
01:13:23,827 --> 01:13:25,774
I found it.

701
01:13:29,545 --> 01:13:33,298
Yes?
- Daddy? Help me.

702
01:13:34,775 --> 01:13:37,463
What have you done?
What did you tell her?

703
01:13:37,578 --> 01:13:40,852
What did you tell her?
- It's the scam.

704
01:13:40,967 --> 01:13:44,233
What are you talking about?
- We started without you.

705
01:13:44,347 --> 01:13:50,039
Xavier I think Iris father-millionaires
am to pick her drug debt to pay off.

706
01:13:51,514 --> 01:13:54,976
We were neither of plan
to you just to drain, Foley.

707
01:13:55,090 --> 01:13:59,235
This could be your masterpiece,
gives all the clippings from my wall.

708
01:13:59,350 --> 01:14:02,861
The chance that this will work
is almost zero.

709
01:14:03,325 --> 01:14:06,331
That is also the chance that Iris
survives the night.

710
01:14:06,445 --> 01:14:10,567
If we do not, he kills her.
I 've seen him do for much less.

711
01:14:10,682 --> 01:14:13,235
Why are you doing this to me?
- You know why.

712
01:14:13,349 --> 01:14:16,619
I did not murder your father, Ethan.

713
01:14:16,734 --> 01:14:18,949
I had no choice.

714
01:14:19,063 --> 01:14:22,623
Then you are so well known
with this kind of precarious situations.

715
01:14:22,738 --> 01:14:25,523
We are talking about Iris her life.

716
01:14:25,638 --> 01:14:29,472
Now is your chance to finally play daddy.

717
01:14:30,851 --> 01:14:32,934
Papa.

718
01:14:36,554 --> 01:14:38,765
Pull your suit.

719
01:15:09,627 --> 01:15:13,560
I thought you would shave.
- Nobody shaves at night.

720
01:15:13,675 --> 01:15:16,190
The scam revolves around the details.

721
01:16:10,227 --> 01:16:12,630
Here is Dad.

722
01:16:13,216 --> 01:16:18,142
I'm sorry to say that your sweet little angel
themselves in trouble have worked.

723
01:16:18,577 --> 01:16:22,030
Unfortunately this is not the first time.

724
01:16:22,193 --> 01:16:25,272
What is it you owe?
- 250 000.

725
01:16:25,386 --> 01:16:27,202
I think you'll find this nice, huh?

726
01:16:27,317 --> 01:16:31,471
More proof that you were right to send me away.
- I sent you away for your own good.

727
01:16:31,585 --> 01:16:35,689
You wanted me to have just gone.
You were never there for me.

728
01:16:35,878 --> 01:16:39,829
When Mom died, I had nothing.
No one wanted me.

729
01:16:39,951 --> 01:16:46,443
This, what is happening here now,
because of you.

730
01:16:46,566 --> 01:16:51,250
And as usual you expect me to pay for your mistakes.

731
01:16:51,365 --> 01:16:56,291
Enough! This is not a family therapy.
I want my money now.

732
01:17:00,298 --> 01:17:02,114
Please...

733
01:17:03,794 --> 01:17:05,783
Help me.

734
01:17:07,614 --> 01:17:09,885
Dad, I need help.

735
01:17:18,701 --> 01:17:23,849
My cell phone.
- I had not told you to do something.

736
01:17:27,466 --> 01:17:31,693
I'm sorry.
Were you planning to cash a check?

737
01:17:32,199 --> 01:17:38,518
I make an electronic transfer.
- So I've got my account information?

738
01:17:38,633 --> 01:17:45,052
I want this information.
I do not know your name, I want nothing about you.

739
01:17:48,661 --> 01:17:51,316
I just got all the money...

740
01:17:51,317 --> 01:17:55,072
of one of my foreign accounts
met, except $ 250,000.

741
01:17:55,391 --> 01:17:58,516
I removed my password.
All you need to do...

742
01:17:58,631 --> 01:18:01,025
Is yours to enter. Then you have full access to the money...

743
01:18:01,140 --> 01:18:04,394
And you can make about
to wherever you want.

744
01:18:25,465 --> 01:18:30,182
I want you to check account activity
in Belize.

745
01:18:30,369 --> 01:18:34,418
Yes, that's because it does not matter
me what time it is there.

746
01:18:36,093 --> 01:18:39,590
$ 250,000.

747
01:18:55,543 --> 01:18:57,448
Are we ready?

748
01:18:58,223 --> 01:19:02,141
How much do you stand on the foreign accounts?

749
01:19:03,649 --> 01:19:08,348
That I had less than three million are

750
01:19:08,870 --> 01:19:12,986
Do you have a few with more than eight?
- Why?

751
01:19:14,239 --> 01:19:17,472
I would like you to
a new deal considering.

752
01:19:19,281 --> 01:19:22,596
I have eight million U.S. dollars to be laundered...

753
01:19:22,711 --> 01:19:26,632
And it seems that your
excellent cleaning results.

754
01:19:27,501 --> 01:19:32,339
Before you decide, Vernon,
would you like to give us a preview?

755
01:19:38,384 --> 01:19:40,843
This is very beautiful.

756
01:19:40,958 --> 01:19:44,472
Do you have a wine cellar?
- Yes.

757
01:19:45,745 --> 01:19:50,730
I once bought a house a couple
incapacitated because of the cellar.

758
01:19:50,845 --> 01:19:53,392
The woman, who sold it...

759
01:19:53,507 --> 01:19:59,200
Took me down, because the collection of
her future ex-husband was there.

760
01:19:59,315 --> 01:20:06,296
La Vite '59, '61 O'Brien,
'45 Brunello, really fantastic.

761
01:20:06,411 --> 01:20:10,303
Then my eye fell on the thermostat
and I say to her:...

762
01:20:10,418 --> 01:20:14,254
"I do not know how to tell you this,
but this basement would be 12 degrees...

763
01:20:14,369 --> 01:20:17,106
'But it is 24 degrees.'

764
01:20:17,220 --> 01:20:27,240
And she looks at me with a crooked eye,
, and she says coolly, "I know."

765
01:20:29,090 --> 01:20:33,491
Yes, I also have a La Vite 61
I save for a special occasion.

766
01:20:34,260 --> 01:20:39,962
He must be drunk
soon as the cork is almost dry.

767
01:20:47,310 --> 01:20:49,912
The rest is in the car.

768
01:20:52,606 --> 01:20:54,532
What is happening?

769
01:20:54,862 --> 01:20:56,987
Watch and learn.

770
01:20:57,102 --> 01:21:02,404
The usual locks cost me a minimum of
30%, which is $ 2.5 million.

771
01:21:02,519 --> 01:21:04,107
This is eight clean.

772
01:21:04,222 --> 01:21:06,543
What if he tries...
- He will not try.

773
01:21:06,657 --> 01:21:09,402
If he does,
we change his mind.

774
01:21:11,431 --> 01:21:17,147
It seems to me that my
if you want help with your problem...

775
01:21:17,220 --> 01:21:21,712
The more value to me to have
than just the return of my $ 250,000.

776
01:21:21,777 --> 01:21:24,322
And your daughter.
- 15%.

777
01:21:27,007 --> 01:21:30,669
So we agree with 10.

778
01:21:39,336 --> 01:21:41,239
I do not know.

779
01:21:46,618 --> 01:21:49,152
Why did you do that?

780
01:21:49,267 --> 01:21:51,953
You wanted him to change their minds.
- Help me.

781
01:21:52,093 --> 01:21:55,739
The only way you can help your daughter
, is to accept the deal.

782
01:21:55,853 --> 01:21:59,989
I need her to go to the hospital.
- And you will once things settled.

783
01:22:00,103 --> 01:22:03,980
Please press. Hold on.
What do you want me to do?

784
01:22:04,095 --> 01:22:07,230
Same as first, you deposit some money at
one of my accounts...

785
01:22:07,345 --> 01:22:10,728
And you take the cash to.
Do we have a deal?

786
01:22:12,179 --> 01:22:14,601
Do we have a deal?

787
01:22:15,111 --> 01:22:16,956
No.

788
01:22:21,506 --> 01:22:23,376
No deal.

789
01:22:29,921 --> 01:22:33,401
You can not make the deal,
because he is not a developer.

790
01:22:34,132 --> 01:22:36,230
He is a swindler.

791
01:22:37,807 --> 01:22:40,995
And this is a scam.

792
01:22:42,637 --> 01:22:45,118
What makes you the target.

793
01:22:46,506 --> 01:22:48,850
Why would you tell me this?

794
01:22:49,317 --> 01:22:52,475
Because nothing changes unless you make sure it changes.

795
01:22:53,993 --> 01:22:55,831
What are you talking about hell?

796
01:22:55,832 --> 01:22:58,080
I tell you, not because I
give money.

797
01:22:59,206 --> 01:23:03,683
I just want that piece of shit
knows how close he had everything he wanted...

798
01:23:03,797 --> 01:23:07,581
Just before you shoot him dead.
No, not him.

799
01:23:08,900 --> 01:23:10,756
Him.

800
01:23:12,648 --> 01:23:14,488
It's lying.
- Dirty bastard.

801
01:23:14,603 --> 01:23:17,939
She is his daughter. They...
- I know, Ethan.

802
01:23:19,009 --> 01:23:22,683
He's your father.
- I know, Ethan.

803
01:23:23,385 --> 01:23:25,974
You can not hurt me anymore.

804
01:23:27,131 --> 01:23:28,902
Do you know?

805
01:23:31,816 --> 01:23:34,153
I'm with Celia visited.

806
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:52,299
I have been in that position.

807
01:23:52,368 --> 01:23:56,544
There is only one way for this to be
digen.

808
01:23:56,626 --> 01:24:02,597
I'll tell you what you want to know, and if you
do not believe me, but stop a bullet in me.

809
01:24:02,695 --> 01:24:05,041
Just let her go.

810
01:24:07,607 --> 01:24:11,756
Nobody ever goes anywhere.

811
01:24:24,665 --> 01:24:26,405
Are you okay?

812
01:24:26,995 --> 01:24:29,255
Stay here.

813
01:24:54,871 --> 01:25:00,084
I am not disabled because eight million U.S. dollars.

814
01:25:00,492 --> 01:25:03,372
It's only money.

815
01:25:05,567 --> 01:25:07,438
Take it.

816
01:25:09,054 --> 01:25:11,131
Take the money.

817
01:25:13,477 --> 01:25:15,400
We can make a deal.

818
01:25:19,571 --> 01:25:24,636
Do you know who I am?
- I know exactly who you are.

819
01:25:24,751 --> 01:25:27,300
Why do I do this.

820
01:25:43,968 --> 01:25:46,990
Let's go. Come on,
we have here. Let's go.

821
01:25:47,104 --> 01:25:48,994
No.

822
01:25:52,130 --> 01:25:53,841
Iris.

823
01:26:42,254 --> 01:26:45,911
Miro, help us, please.

824
01:26:46,026 --> 01:26:50,212
She's an immediate blood transfusion,
but the clinic has no blood supply.

825
01:26:50,327 --> 01:26:53,193
Use me.
- We have no time to blood testing.

826
01:26:53,308 --> 01:26:55,605
When I give her the wrong blood she dies.

827
01:26:55,720 --> 01:26:58,335
If we find a relative,
as they are related...

828
01:26:58,336 --> 01:27:01,439
Miro, it will work.

829
01:27:24,881 --> 01:27:26,699
Miro...

830
01:27:28,491 --> 01:27:32,760
I have some money, here you can find it.

831
01:27:33,119 --> 01:27:35,395
Take what you need.

832
01:27:36,719 --> 01:27:40,770
And give the rest to her.
- Foley, you survive this.

833
01:27:40,885 --> 01:27:43,471
Let me stop the transfusion.

834
01:27:44,445 --> 01:27:46,866
She needed a second chance.

835
01:28:56,676 --> 01:29:02,801
You must sign here and here.
- How exactly does the transfer take?

836
01:29:03,284 --> 01:29:05,335
A moment.

837
01:29:08,489 --> 01:29:10,514
Exactly so long.

838
01:29:13,801 --> 01:29:18,222
How long were you planning to stay here?
- I'm not sure.

839
01:29:20,057 --> 01:29:22,690
How long does it take to get lost?

840
01:29:37,709 --> 01:29:40,495
If you keep going with what you've always done...

841
01:29:40,610 --> 01:29:43,701
You keep what you have always been.

842
01:29:45,025 --> 01:29:48,618
Nothing changes unless you ensure that it changes

843
01:29:49,381 --> 01:29:51,775
I know how it sounds...

844
01:29:51,890 --> 01:29:56,708
But every morning when I wake up I think about what
really means.

845
01:29:58,230 --> 01:30:03,243
Nothing changes unless you ensure that it changes

846
01:30:05,441 --> 01:30:09,622

847
01:30:10,654 --> 01:30:15,878

848
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:19,125

849
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:23,139
