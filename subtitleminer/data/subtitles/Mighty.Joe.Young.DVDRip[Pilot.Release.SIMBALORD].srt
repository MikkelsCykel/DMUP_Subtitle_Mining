[ Ron ] This product has been tested

Elliot, she has
no scientific training.

That ape is the best fund-raising tool

You know what I'm talking about.

Usually you are out the door
as soon as the animal's in his habitat.

679
00:52:11,874 --> 00:52:14,035
You have a very active imagination.

I don't think so.

I think Mister World Traveller has
goo-goo eyes for the gorilla girl.

one of the world's most important
zoological finds of this century.

This is the home of what is believed
to be the world's largest primate,

a 2,000-pound gorilla named Joe.

Joe has been at the California
Animal Conservancy for
a little over a month now.

690
00:52:53,977 --> 00:52:57,339
He was brought here from Africa
by Dr Gregory O'Hara,

- who told me that because
of Joe's remarkable size,
- My God, Pindi was right.

he is a natural target for poachers.

Animal Conservancy programme...

by Jill Young, the daughter of
famed primatologist Ruth Young.

Their closeness stems
from a tragic bond.

702

Both Joe and Jill's mothers
were killed by poachers
12 years ago in the Pangani Forest.
