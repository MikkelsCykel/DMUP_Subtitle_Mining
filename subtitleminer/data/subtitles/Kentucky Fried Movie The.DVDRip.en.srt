With Argon, we know that a
country that depends on oil

3
00:01:08,467 --> 00:01:10,378
Has not the means of some to lack.

4
00:01:10,507 --> 00:01:13,305
But classical drilling
always is not possible.

5
00:01:13,427 --> 00:01:17,215
It is necessary to find again
procedures to produce crude oil

6
00:01:17,747 --> 00:01:20,864
<i>In this refinery of Fairbanks
who tosses billion dollars</i>

<i>one extracts more than 2, 5 billions
of barrels of crude every day,</i>

<i>From the skin of adolescent ones.</i>

9
00:01:27,947 --> 00:01:30,825
<i>The crude oil is
transported in supertankers</i>

10
00:01:30,947 --> 00:01:33,541
<i>in order more better
to use the resources</i>

26

<i>Why the trains are slower in Vermont.</i>

27

<i>We will see an adorable
animal to hair of Australia.</i>

28
00:02:41,307 --> 00:02:44,140
<i>And we will examine a
new system of security:</i>

29
00:02:44,267 --> 00:02:46,417
<i>The detectors of
smoke. But first of all,</i>

30
00:02:46,547 --> 00:02:50,460
<i>in New York, the teachers vote

<i>Did the teachers finish to vote?</i>

<i>He/it is the hour passed of 18

<i>of our dear President.</i>

42
00:03:34,707 --> 00:03:36,982
<i>The intellectuals unleashed themselves,</i>

43
00:03:37,107 --> 00:03:41,897
<i>and now that they have the power

46
00:03:49,067 --> 00:03:53,379
<i>Sheila, you and your strip
of liberals to the big heart,</i>

47
00:03:53,547 --> 00:03:56,505
<i>won't know yourselves therefore
ever that the social help</i>

<i>My poor John! Species of old chnoque.</i>

51
00:04:09,787 --> 00:04:13,336
I listen to your
stupidities since months.

52
00:04:13,507 --> 00:04:17,102
You can keep them and to
put them to you to the ass.

53
00:04:17,227 --> 00:04:21,903
And to crown the all, sit
yourselves on that, John.

54
00:04:23,667 --> 00:04:28,183
The professors finished to
vote and the result is imminent.

55
00:04:28,307 --> 00:04:31,697
Ron Butler, have yourselves a
prognosis as for the exit of the vote?

56
00:04:37,067 --> 00:04:40,662
II is the hour passed of 19
min., here is our daily category:

57
00:04:40,787 --> 00:04:42,505
"The astrological news."

58
00:04:42,667 --> 00:04:46,945
We don't try to reinforce
your belief in the astrology,

59
00:04:47,067 --> 00:04:51,618
but to help the incapable
people to take only decisions.

60
00:04:52,067 --> 00:04:56,345
If you are Balance and hesitate
to make this important purchase,

61
00:04:56,467 --> 00:04:58,583
wait for even some days.

62
00:04:58,707 --> 00:05:01,665
Don't forget that your
Moon is in Sagittarius.

63
00:05:01,787 --> 00:05:04,176
It is not the moment
to make some madness.

64
00:05:04,307 --> 00:05:07,424
The Virgin must expect
to a premature death

65
00:05:07,587 --> 00:05:12,024
or to the tragic
écartèlement of a near being.

66
00:05:12,147 --> 00:05:15,662
Let's pitch, it is the moment
ideal to disconnect the device

67
00:05:15,787 --> 00:05:19,063
who maintains your daughter
in life since 6 months.

68
00:05:19,187 --> 00:05:21,747
If you are Taurus, go to the zoo.

69
00:05:21,867 --> 00:05:26,383
And if you are Gemini as me, wait
for yourselves to the unexpected.

70
00:05:26,507 --> 00:05:29,226
Joyce Wilson, your astro...

71
00:05:31,547 --> 00:05:32,821
Thank you, Joyce.

72
00:05:32,947 --> 00:05:36,735
Judy Morton is with us since
the reserve natural of San Diego.

73
00:05:36,867 --> 00:05:40,860
We often received Judy,
with always as much pleasure.

74
00:05:40,987 --> 00:05:42,306
Welcome, Judy.

75
00:05:42,427 --> 00:05:43,382
What of nine?

76
00:05:43,507 --> 00:05:45,816
I brought you an Australian gerbille,

77
00:05:45,947 --> 00:05:48,256
one of the rare to have
been raised in captivity.

78
00:05:48,387 --> 00:05:50,105
She/it is raised, doesn't she/it bite?

79
00:05:50,227 --> 00:05:51,899
No, she/it is very cute.

80
00:05:52,027 --> 00:05:54,382
They are very endearing.
His/her/its name is Oscar.

81
00:05:57,467 --> 00:05:59,059
I am going to take one
of it for my youngsters.

82
00:05:59,187 --> 00:06:01,018
They would make adorable
animals of company

83
00:06:01,187 --> 00:06:03,257
but they have indeed
need to live in liberty.

84
00:06:03,467 --> 00:06:04,946
Hey well... Oscar?

85
00:06:05,347 --> 00:06:07,417
II is absolutely irresistible.

86
00:06:07,547 --> 00:06:10,141
You have another surprise for us.

87
00:06:10,267 --> 00:06:11,586
Quite.

88
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:15,626
This one is not small,
but he/it is very cute.

89
00:06:15,787 --> 00:06:18,585
In any case, it is my opinion.
I am going to look for it.

90
00:06:18,747 --> 00:06:19,975
Go there.

91
00:06:20,147 --> 00:06:23,583
It is the moment that I prefer
in this broadcast, because

92
00:06:23,747 --> 00:06:26,466
I never know what they
are going to bring me.

93
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,184
Look at what one brings to me!

94
00:06:29,307 --> 00:06:31,059
I present you Dino.

95
00:06:33,867 --> 00:06:35,095
He/it is enormous!

96
00:06:35,227 --> 00:06:37,343
But you don't deceive there,

97
00:06:37,467 --> 00:06:40,982
he/it is soft like a lamb because
he/it has been raised in captivity.

98
00:06:41,107 --> 00:06:42,859
It is for that that
one could bring it here.

99
00:06:43,067 --> 00:06:44,420
Is it a rare animal?

100
00:06:44,547 --> 00:06:48,062
Yes, and besides we have
of the pain to mate it.

101
00:06:48,507 --> 00:06:50,862
You don't manage to
find a female for Dino?

102
00:06:51,307 --> 00:06:56,142
Not indeed, we have him
presented several candidates,

103
00:06:56,307 --> 00:07:00,220
but all attempts of mating failed.

104
00:07:00,347 --> 00:07:04,659
It is surprising. Dino is
not the most attractive party

105
00:07:04,827 --> 00:07:07,705
that I saw, but a big gorilla as him...

106
00:07:07,867 --> 00:07:10,904
We don't know very well
what is his/her/its problem.

107
00:07:11,027 --> 00:07:12,824
He/it is maybe shy,

108
00:07:12,987 --> 00:07:16,297
carried naturally little
on the thing or impotent.

109
00:07:16,427 --> 00:07:17,337
Impotent?

110
00:07:27,867 --> 00:07:30,062
II is the hour passed of 24 min.,

111
00:07:30,187 --> 00:07:33,543
here is the main information
of the morning with Tom Leclair.

112
00:07:34,267 --> 00:07:35,495
Thank you, Barbara.

113
00:07:35,627 --> 00:07:39,779
We are going to speak of the meeting
of the ministers of the OPEC in Tehran.

114
00:07:39,987 --> 00:07:43,821
As foreseen, the rise of
10% of the price of oil...

115
00:07:47,507 --> 00:07:50,305
We could finally
communicate with Ron Butler,

116
00:07:50,427 --> 00:07:54,215
and one tells to me that the
link audio function. To you, Ron.

117
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:57,016
The vote lasts since 3 hours.

118
00:07:57,147 --> 00:08:00,219
The result now depends of
the number of abstentions.

119
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:03,978
Already have yourselves an
idea of what is going to happen?

120
00:08:04,787 --> 00:08:07,460
I thought that the teachers
wanted to take work,

121
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:11,375
but as Gemini, I am
incapable to foresee anything.

122
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:52,461

Mrs. Burke! I took you for Dale.

138
00:09:58,787 --> 00:10:02,860
People often confound me with
my teenage daughter, Dale.

139
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:12,739

Hello and welcome to
"The big adventure."

206
00:16:28,427 --> 00:16:30,258
I am Paul Burmaster.

207
00:16:30,387 --> 00:16:33,538
With us today, the big
adventurer and explorer,

208
00:16:33,707 --> 00:16:34,935
Claude Lamont.

209
00:16:35,147 --> 00:16:37,707
Claude, we are delighted to receive you.

210
00:16:37,827 --> 00:16:39,738
I am delighted to be here.

211
00:16:39,867 --> 00:16:42,097
It is great to meet a man

212
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:44,223
who lives such adventures.

213
00:16:44,387 --> 00:16:46,696
I live the unknown,

214
00:16:46,827 --> 00:16:49,739
I like the unknown, I am the unknown.

215
00:16:49,867 --> 00:16:52,540
Claude... Where do you live, currently?

216
00:16:52,667 --> 00:16:54,862
That is a matter for the
unknown. I don't know.

217
00:16:55,227 --> 00:16:59,505
Speak to us the movie that
we are going to see today.

218
00:16:59,667 --> 00:17:03,137
He/it appears that you
have faced a lot of dangers.

219
00:17:03,827 --> 00:17:07,024
Yes, I faced full of dangers.

220
00:17:07,187 --> 00:17:11,260
The most dangerous thing,
it was the venomous fish.

221
00:17:11,907 --> 00:17:13,135
The venomous fish?

222
00:17:14,827 --> 00:17:16,180
Pursue, it is your broadcast.

223
00:17:16,307 --> 00:17:17,626
No, you are my guest.

224
00:17:20,187 --> 00:17:23,782
The venomous fish kill
more quickly than a bullet.

225
00:17:23,907 --> 00:17:26,740
In what ocean one finds it?

226
00:17:26,867 --> 00:17:28,903
The Atlantic and the Pacific.

227
00:17:29,027 --> 00:17:31,905
Are they big how?

228
00:17:32,067 --> 00:17:34,456
Some are very big, of very small others.

229
00:17:36,107 --> 00:17:37,426
It is fascinating.

230
00:17:38,427 --> 00:17:39,860
Tell us, Claude,

231
00:17:41,947 --> 00:17:44,859
how many men take yourselves with you?

232
00:17:45,027 --> 00:17:48,906
Sometimes, we take until 45 or 50 men

233
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:50,506
during only one journey.

234
00:17:51,027 --> 00:17:52,938
- So much as that?
- Quite.

235
00:17:53,067 --> 00:17:56,742
You imagine the problems
of food that that puts.

236
00:17:57,267 --> 00:18:00,145
Often, we must carry
away enough food for 3

237
00:18:00,307 --> 00:18:02,104
or 4 months in a row.

238
00:18:02,507 --> 00:18:04,862
The important, it is to eat well

239
00:18:04,987 --> 00:18:07,262
and in a regular way.

240
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:11,460
Because if you don't make
of balanced meals in sea,

241
00:18:11,827 --> 00:18:13,943
of numerous things can occur.

242
00:18:25,627 --> 00:18:28,539
To the fact, you don't
know it maybe not,

243
00:18:28,667 --> 00:18:32,626
but Claude Lamont made a
lot of humanitarian actions.

244
00:18:32,747 --> 00:18:37,502
He/it is monitor of diving and
dedicates itself to numerous reasons.

245
00:18:38,267 --> 00:18:42,306
You studied a lot the big white shark.

246
00:18:42,427 --> 00:18:46,420
Have noted you that he/it exists
of the definite territories?

247
00:18:46,547 --> 00:18:51,302
Not only this idea has very
often been corroborated,

248
00:18:51,427 --> 00:18:55,625
but we have the proof
that practically no shark

249
00:18:55,747 --> 00:18:58,580
don't change a territory.

250
00:18:59,267 --> 00:19:03,704
I received the famous tonight
explorer Claude Lamont.

251
00:19:03,987 --> 00:19:06,979

257
00:19:32,747 --> 00:19:37,343
When I am on a plateau and
that I have the migraine,

258
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:39,139
I take the Sanhedrin.

259
00:19:39,307 --> 00:19:43,903
Here, to the biggest
clinic, of the migraine,

260
00:19:44,027 --> 00:19:46,700
some tests proved that the new Sanhedrin

261
00:19:46,827 --> 00:19:49,500
relieve the pains quickly

262
00:19:49,627 --> 00:19:53,939
due to the migraines, to the colds, or
to the small crises of osteoarthritis.

263
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:55,341
It is sure...

264
00:19:55,467 --> 00:19:57,935
and efficient. To
take care of your cold,

265

Does Harvey always smoke these cigars?

271
00:20:39,387 --> 00:20:42,743
Name of God! Did a
cow crap here or what?

272
00:20:54,067 --> 00:20:55,659
It was a delicious to dine.

273
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:57,937

OUR MOVIE

325
00:25:52,667 --> 00:25:56,706
LUC'S ISLAND OF IT, APRIL 9 11 HS 42

326
00:26:03,947 --> 00:26:05,221
<i>II has three days there, </i></i>

327
00:26:05,947 --> 00:26:08,302
<i>les Russian secret services </
i> ont sent this cliché </i></i>

328
00:26:08,427 --> 00:26:12,056
<i>représentant an explosion </i>
nucléaire of 30 megatons. </i></i>

329
00:26:13,147 --> 00:26:17,220
The CIA first of all made
a closeness with China,

330
00:26:18,107 --> 00:26:22,225
but Radio Peking denied the allegation.

331
00:26:23,347 --> 00:26:25,781
Here are the Hartz mounts, in Asia.

332
00:26:25,947 --> 00:26:30,065
A so rough and so traitorous
region, that no country claims it.

333
00:26:30,587 --> 00:26:31,781
Worse than Detroit?

334
00:26:31,947 --> 00:26:33,585
I am afraid of it.

335
00:26:34,507 --> 00:26:35,303
It is there,

336
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,987
that doctor Klahn constructed
his/her/its fortress.

337
00:26:38,467 --> 00:26:39,377
Klahn?

338
00:26:39,547 --> 00:26:41,583
Klahn exercised

339
00:26:41,707 --> 00:26:45,416
of numerous infamous activities:

340
00:26:45,787 --> 00:26:48,347
Opium, gunrunning, murders,

341
00:26:48,467 --> 00:26:50,219
distribution of movies...

342
00:26:50,667 --> 00:26:52,305
And generalized racket.

343
00:26:52,427 --> 00:26:54,861
Precisely. Klahn kidnapped

344
00:26:55,587 --> 00:27:00,217
the famous nuclear physicist
complicate, Pr. Ada Gronick.

345
00:27:00,387 --> 00:27:01,820
And he/it has the intention

346
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:04,296
to use his/her/its knowledge
of the nuclear contraptions

347
00:27:04,427 --> 00:27:07,499
to create a manageable detonator,

348
00:27:07,627 --> 00:27:10,585
with which he/it will
threaten the world.

349
00:27:11,827 --> 00:27:15,661
Here is Butkus. The bodyguard of Klahn.

350
00:27:15,947 --> 00:27:18,063
He/it is strong and useless.

351
00:27:19,427 --> 00:27:22,419
Here is Kwong, the driver of Klahn.

352
00:27:22,547 --> 00:27:24,822
He/it is strong and toothless.

353
00:27:25,307 --> 00:27:28,185
We need someone who finds
an uncharted mountain,

354
00:27:28,307 --> 00:27:30,218
beats an army of killers

355
00:27:30,507 --> 00:27:33,067
and comes back with Ada Gronick.

356
00:27:33,267 --> 00:27:34,985
I have the man that we need.

357
00:27:44,427 --> 00:27:48,545
A HANDFUL OF YEN

358
00:28:46,547 --> 00:28:49,345
I hope that you observe well.

359
00:28:56,107 --> 00:28:57,381
Hit me.

360
00:29:06,427 --> 00:29:07,826
What is that that?

361
00:29:08,627 --> 00:29:10,982
It is not a game.

362
00:29:11,427 --> 00:29:14,783
It is necessary to be
concentrated completely.

363
00:29:16,067 --> 00:29:18,103
One restarts.

364
00:29:18,227 --> 00:29:22,186
This time, with the feeling.

365
00:29:28,387 --> 00:29:29,502
It is better.

366
00:29:39,267 --> 00:29:42,703
My government is ready
to give you 50000 books

367
00:29:42,827 --> 00:29:45,136
so that you infiltrated
the army of Klahn.

368
00:29:48,147 --> 00:29:51,378
I fear than you me
underestimated, Mr. Pennington.

369
00:29:51,947 --> 00:29:54,666
Your people and mine,
have different values.

370
00:29:55,587 --> 00:29:56,702
Mr. Loo,

371
00:29:56,907 --> 00:30:00,695
know that the survival
some free world is in game.

372
00:30:00,827 --> 00:30:02,977
Know, Mr. Pennington,

373
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:07,340
that the geographical borders
don't mean anything for me.

374
00:30:07,707 --> 00:30:11,017
I obey a superior process.

375
00:30:12,467 --> 00:30:15,698
But you will be able
to kill 50 or 60 people.

376
00:30:38,707 --> 00:30:42,017
Hello, I am called Miong Chow.

377
00:30:42,667 --> 00:30:45,306
You join a noble chief.

378
00:32:34,187 --> 00:32:36,747
Gentlemen, be the welcome.

379
00:32:37,147 --> 00:32:39,707
We are honored very
to have you among us.

380
00:32:40,507 --> 00:32:42,304
We construct a strength of fight

381
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:45,703
of an extraordinary power.

382
00:32:46,307 --> 00:32:48,059
We draw our courage

383
00:32:48,187 --> 00:32:51,497
in the tradition of our forebears.

384
00:32:51,827 --> 00:32:54,705
You have our gratitude.

385
00:33:18,627 --> 00:33:20,697
ADA, I CAME TO SAVE YOU

386
00:33:28,987 --> 00:33:31,581
Bring me the prisoners!

387
00:33:49,107 --> 00:33:51,826
Take it and torture it.

388
00:33:58,147 --> 00:34:00,377
As for my American friend,

389
00:34:00,787 --> 00:34:03,620
the CIA thinks that
she/it can infiltrate

390
00:34:03,747 --> 00:34:05,783
the mountains of doctor Klahn?

391
00:34:06,107 --> 00:34:09,019
You don't frighten me,
species of dirty constricted.

392
00:34:11,267 --> 00:34:13,178
Take it in Detroit.

393
00:34:14,707 --> 00:34:16,777
No! Not Detroit!

394
00:34:16,907 --> 00:34:20,058
Mercy! All safe that!

395
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:25,146
That way, gentlemen. I
drive you to your rooms.

396
00:34:32,867 --> 00:34:37,577
<i>Allô, here doctor Klahn. </i>
Je is at present absent, </i></i>

397
00:34:37,987 --> 00:34:40,785
<i>laissez me a message </
i> après the beep. </i></i>

398
00:34:40,907 --> 00:34:43,102
<i>Vous has all my gratitude. </i></i>

399
00:35:03,147 --> 00:35:04,102
Enter.

400
00:35:09,787 --> 00:35:12,017
I am here to save you.

401
00:35:12,227 --> 00:35:13,626
From where do you come?

402
00:35:14,147 --> 00:35:15,375
Pennington...

403
00:35:17,707 --> 00:35:20,699
How spent your journey
in the mountains, Mr. Loo?

404
00:35:21,747 --> 00:35:25,262
It was a very pleasant journey.

405
00:35:25,387 --> 00:35:29,380
You have luck. The sea can
be unleashed in this season.

406
00:35:29,507 --> 00:35:31,498
I hope that you are satisfied

407
00:35:31,627 --> 00:35:33,458
of your room.

408
00:35:35,267 --> 00:35:38,816
Doctor Klahn has a big
sense of the hospitality.

409
00:35:39,907 --> 00:35:43,297
You already joined an army
practicing the martial arts?

410
00:35:44,307 --> 00:35:46,741
Not since a very long time.

411
00:35:47,027 --> 00:35:51,339
I am sure that our men
will appear you the best

412
00:35:51,467 --> 00:35:52,900
of the world.

413
00:35:53,907 --> 00:35:57,263
We construct a strength
of an extraordinary power.

414
00:35:57,387 --> 00:35:59,343
You honor our mountains.

415
00:35:59,467 --> 00:36:03,346
We draw our courage in the
tradition of our forebears.

416
00:36:05,587 --> 00:36:08,499
It is necessary to bribe
the guards. One needs money.

417
00:36:08,627 --> 00:36:11,141
One will find money without problem.

418
00:36:15,387 --> 00:36:18,299
But it would be badly!

419
00:37:05,947 --> 00:37:07,221
What is that that?

420
00:37:08,067 --> 00:37:11,742
It is not a game. It is necessary

421
00:37:12,187 --> 00:37:14,781
to concentrate in depth.

422
00:37:16,587 --> 00:37:17,815
Restart.

423
00:38:17,387 --> 00:38:20,220
I brought you a gift. Make your choice.

424
00:38:27,547 --> 00:38:29,538
If you don't find your happiness...

425
00:39:22,747 --> 00:39:27,298
If you want to follow me,
we enter in the Havard wing,

426
00:39:27,427 --> 00:39:29,577
where the treatment of the opium end

427
00:39:29,707 --> 00:39:32,904
before being wrapped and
distributed all over the world.

428
00:39:33,027 --> 00:39:35,143
We manufacture sufficiently of heroine

429
00:39:35,267 --> 00:39:38,737
to satisfy one quarter of
the consumers in the world.

430
00:39:38,947 --> 00:39:43,384
These vats contain the
products for the bacterial wars.

431
00:39:43,507 --> 00:39:46,499
Their capacity is of 4000 liters cube.

432
00:39:47,187 --> 00:39:49,257
To my right, the atomic detonator,

433
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:53,266
with which the Dr Kahn counts
to threaten the whole world.

434
00:39:54,027 --> 00:39:55,540
Do you have some questions?

435
00:39:56,347 --> 00:39:59,544
No? Very well. Follow me.
Don't want yourselves éIoigner

436
00:39:59,667 --> 00:40:03,546
of the white line,
and not to use a flash.

437
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,425
A robot!

438
00:41:02,707 --> 00:41:03,981
A robot?

439
00:41:04,507 --> 00:41:06,145
<i>Zigouillez this salopard!</i>

440
00:41:15,587 --> 00:41:19,057
ATOMIC DETONATOR RESPONSIBLE, ADA GRONIK

441
00:42:43,627 --> 00:42:45,697
I follow you very thankful.

442
00:42:45,827 --> 00:42:49,615
You are a man of an extraordinary power.

443
00:43:17,787 --> 00:43:18,822
Enter.

444
00:44:39,827 --> 00:44:44,457
Your technique is not surpassed
that by your courage, Mr. Loo.

445
00:44:45,427 --> 00:44:48,305
A magnificent demonstration of agility.

446
00:44:48,947 --> 00:44:51,222
Your curiosity flatters me.

447
00:44:51,347 --> 00:44:56,102
You are surely impatient
how we operate to see.

448
00:45:06,587 --> 00:45:08,020
Who are they?

449
00:45:08,147 --> 00:45:11,617
Of the useless. Collected in bars.

450
00:45:13,867 --> 00:45:15,016
Done kidnap?

451
00:45:15,147 --> 00:45:19,425
Of the drunkards who don't know
where they are and make fun of all.

452
00:45:21,347 --> 00:45:22,860
Where are we?

453
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:25,343
Me me in madmen.

454
00:45:27,747 --> 00:45:29,021
And them?

455
00:45:29,147 --> 00:45:33,698
Of the drunkards who ignore where
they are but don't do themselves of it.

456
00:45:34,187 --> 00:45:38,703
They know where they are, himself
some don't do but are temperate.

457
00:45:38,867 --> 00:45:41,461
I don't know where I follow.

458
00:45:41,587 --> 00:45:42,861
I don't drink.

459
00:45:43,427 --> 00:45:44,143
Guard!

460
00:45:51,107 --> 00:45:53,063
- You you foutez of all?
- No.

461
00:45:53,187 --> 00:45:56,065
Put it in the cell n°
1 and give him to drink.

462
00:45:57,147 --> 00:45:59,741
- What do you drink?
- Me me in madmen.

463
00:46:06,787 --> 00:46:07,697
Gentlemen.

464
00:46:08,707 --> 00:46:11,665
We discovered alas among us

465
00:46:11,787 --> 00:46:13,857
a hostile visitor.

466
00:46:14,667 --> 00:46:18,216
Mr. Loo is going to be punished
for his/her/its treason.

467
00:46:18,427 --> 00:46:21,305
But it is not important at present.

468
00:46:21,787 --> 00:46:25,666
The important, it is that my
guards accepted some bribes

469
00:46:25,787 --> 00:46:28,255
and missed to their duty.

470
00:46:29,187 --> 00:46:32,497
They must now prove that they deserve

471
00:46:32,627 --> 00:46:34,504
to remain among us.

472
00:46:35,587 --> 00:46:37,976
Present us our guards.

473
00:46:42,107 --> 00:46:46,225
The guard n° 1 is a veteran of
the region and a future chemist.

474
00:46:46,347 --> 00:46:49,066
Please applaud Gone up Well!

475
00:46:52,867 --> 00:46:54,380
The guard n° 2 is a bitten

476
00:46:54,507 --> 00:46:58,546
of skating. An applause
cordial for Big Zizi!

477
00:47:02,827 --> 00:47:06,342
The guard n° 3 often travels
because he/it is pilot of plane.

478
00:47:06,467 --> 00:47:09,698
Please applaud Gigantic Parts.

479
00:47:15,507 --> 00:47:18,340
Guard n° 1, it is your
1 er appointment in love,

480
00:47:18,467 --> 00:47:21,618
he/it is too late to go to
the movies. What do you make?

481
00:47:22,307 --> 00:47:23,535
Hey well...

482
00:47:23,667 --> 00:47:27,296
we walk on the beach to the moonlight.

483
00:47:27,627 --> 00:47:30,664
Then I play of the songs
of love to the guitar.

484
00:47:31,227 --> 00:47:32,262
And the following day morning...

485
00:47:32,427 --> 00:47:33,223
Butkus!

486
00:47:37,547 --> 00:47:38,536
Guard n° 2,

487
00:47:39,627 --> 00:47:43,825
if I slept, and that
you were my wakening,

488
00:47:44,387 --> 00:47:46,378
how would you wake me up?

489
00:47:46,507 --> 00:47:49,101
I would not wake you
up. I am not a bell.

490
00:47:54,787 --> 00:47:55,902
And you, n° 3?

491
00:47:56,547 --> 00:47:57,866
What would you make?

492
00:47:58,387 --> 00:48:02,096
We construct an armed strength
of an extraordinary power.

493
00:48:03,107 --> 00:48:06,304
We draw our courage in the
tradition of our forebears.

494
00:48:06,987 --> 00:48:11,299
The Dr Klahn is an admirable
chief. We testify him our gratitude.

495
00:48:11,467 --> 00:48:13,423
A helping hand in the Dr Klahn!

496
00:48:31,667 --> 00:48:34,579
Are you ready for your early exercises?

497
00:54:19,147 --> 00:54:20,500
No water!

498
00:54:28,627 --> 00:54:30,902
I melt!

499
00:54:31,907 --> 00:54:32,942
What world!

500
00:54:34,947 --> 00:54:38,383
II had a power of matchless fight.

501
00:54:42,427 --> 00:54:44,145
Congratulations, Mr. Loo.

502
00:54:44,667 --> 00:54:46,976
Your mission is a big success.

503
00:54:47,387 --> 00:54:50,379
Since you provoked the
death of the Dr Klahn,

504
00:54:50,507 --> 00:54:55,183
you have the enjoyment of his/her/its
fortress and of his/her/its wealths.

505
00:54:56,627 --> 00:54:58,538
Thank you, Mr. Pennington.

506
00:54:59,067 --> 00:55:02,377
But I only want a thing,
to go back at home.

507
00:55:03,547 --> 00:55:05,185
To the Kansas.

508
00:55:05,307 --> 00:55:10,176
But my dear, you have the
power to bring all alone in.

509
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:11,422
Indeed?

510
00:55:11,707 --> 00:55:15,700
You only have to slap
your heels three times,

511
00:55:15,867 --> 00:55:19,655
while saying: "One is
never as well as at home.

512
00:55:26,587 --> 00:55:29,260
One is never as well that at home.

513
00:55:47,187 --> 00:55:48,381
Loo...

514
00:55:48,507 --> 00:55:51,180
Wake you up.

515
00:55:54,267 --> 00:55:55,666

517
00:56:00,787 --> 00:56:01,902
I finally went back.

518
00:56:02,027 --> 00:56:04,461
You should have made a nightmare.

519
00:56:06,707 --> 00:56:07,981
I was of it.

520
00:56:08,147 --> 00:56:09,580
Where that?

521
00:56:10,267 --> 00:56:11,461
On this awful mountain

522
00:56:11,627 --> 00:56:13,345
governed by the abominable Dr Klahn.

523
00:56:13,507 --> 00:56:15,145
There were some prisoners,

524
00:56:15,627 --> 00:56:16,776
Jake was there and...

525
00:56:18,787 --> 00:56:20,584
Slim, and Ben.

526
00:56:24,307 --> 00:56:26,025
It was maybe a dream.

527
00:56:26,187 --> 00:56:28,303
And nasty, with that!

528
00:56:28,427 --> 00:56:31,624
A dream of an extraordinary power.

529
00:56:33,627 --> 00:56:36,095
- It was real.
- I know, my small.

530
00:56:36,587 --> 00:56:38,942
But that you did learn of all that?

531
00:56:39,427 --> 00:56:40,462
Hey well,

532
00:56:41,347 --> 00:56:44,180
one can look everywhere for happiness,

533
00:56:45,267 --> 00:56:48,816
but it is not the pain to look
for farther than his/her/its door.

534
00:56:49,307 --> 00:56:52,458
One can make full of things
within his/her/its community.

535
00:56:54,547 --> 00:56:56,219
To go in a dairy

536
00:56:56,587 --> 00:56:59,818
to see how milk is
prepared and put in bottles.

537
00:57:00,787 --> 00:57:03,745
To make an expo on
the domestic accidents.

538
00:57:04,307 --> 00:57:06,218
Or to finance a library.

539
00:57:06,667 --> 00:57:10,296
To ask your dentist how
to embellish your teeth.

<i>"Strongly the apocalypse! "</i></i>

616
01:01:35,427 --> 01:01:37,895
You understood me very well!

617
01:01:39,747 --> 01:01:40,896
To the course of the last years,

618
01:01:41,067 --> 01:01:43,740
more than 800000 Americans died.

619
01:01:43,907 --> 01:01:46,182
In spite of the sums
enclosed in research,

620
01:01:46,307 --> 01:01:49,504
the death always makes the
biggest number of victims.

621
01:01:49,627 --> 01:01:51,743
Hello, I am Henry Gibson.

622
01:01:51,867 --> 01:01:55,177
I speak you to the name of
the Fund United for the Deaths.

623
01:01:55,707 --> 01:01:57,345
There is not a treatment again

624
01:01:57,547 --> 01:01:59,583
against the paralyzing
effect of the death,

625
01:01:59,747 --> 01:02:04,537
but each can get ready to
the 3 signs annonciateurs:

626
01:02:04,667 --> 01:02:06,737
1: Deathly stiffness.

627
01:02:06,867 --> 01:02:09,097
2: Odor of decomposition.

628
01:02:09,227 --> 01:02:11,866
3: Occasional somnolence.

629
01:02:11,987 --> 01:02:14,979
It is important to know
what to do when one dies.

630
01:02:15,187 --> 01:02:18,065
1: Don't drive of car.

631
01:02:18,187 --> 01:02:21,020
2: Don't manipulate of big contraptions.

632
01:02:21,147 --> 01:02:22,899
3: Don't speak.

633
01:02:23,347 --> 01:02:27,659
Your grants for this reason
already made some miracles.

634
01:02:27,827 --> 01:02:30,182
Of numerous families
have can be rescued.

635
01:02:30,307 --> 01:02:33,299
I would like to present
you the Hefsteders.

636
01:02:34,107 --> 01:02:36,541
3 years ago, our small Johnny died.

637
01:02:36,747 --> 01:02:39,215
One believed that it was
without hope, then one discovered

638
01:02:39,387 --> 01:02:41,264
the Fund United for the Deaths.

639
01:02:41,467 --> 01:02:43,981
They showed us that in spite
of his/her/its handicap,

640
01:02:44,107 --> 01:02:47,304
Johnny could be even useful to
his/her/its family and to the society.

Henry Gibson asks you

649
01:03:17,987 --> 01:03:21,536
to be generous when the
death knocks at your door.

650
01:03:23,947 --> 01:03:26,700
No photos, please.

651
01:03:27,467 --> 01:03:29,697

No photos.

654
01:03:46,587 --> 01:03:49,260
September 22, 1957,

655
01:03:49,387 --> 01:03:51,662
took place a collision
between several vehicles

656
01:03:51,787 --> 01:03:55,336
causing more 55000 $ of damages.

657
01:03:55,787 --> 01:03:59,302
We attend the suit here
instituted following the accident.

658
01:03:59,907 --> 01:04:03,820
The plaintiffs that you are going to
see have been implied in the accident.

659
01:04:04,107 --> 01:04:07,782
While we join the court,
judge Coarse DeSmizer,

660
01:04:07,907 --> 01:04:11,536
go ask M. Hornung to make
his/her/its exploratory remarks.

661
01:04:11,827 --> 01:04:15,183
Mr. Hornung, make your
exploratory remarks.

662
01:04:16,987 --> 01:04:20,377
If the court allows it to me,
ladies and gentlemen the jurors,

663
01:04:20,507 --> 01:04:22,498
I would like to prove today

664
01:04:22,627 --> 01:04:26,336
that to the evening
of February 22, 1957,

665
01:04:26,467 --> 01:04:28,776
Sheldon Grunwald drove his/her/its car

666
01:04:28,947 --> 01:04:31,859
on the freeway 30, in
direction of the north,

667
01:04:32,027 --> 01:04:34,939
when the rear of his/her/its
vehicle has been embossed

668
01:04:35,067 --> 01:04:37,342
by the conducted car by the defendant,

669
01:04:37,507 --> 01:04:38,860
Mile Rita Filagree.

670
01:04:39,627 --> 01:04:43,256
In conclusion, your Honor,
I would like that the jurors

671
01:04:43,387 --> 01:04:45,025
listen to a strip.

672
01:04:51,147 --> 01:04:54,537
Hey, Wally, it is terrific
to be at the court.

673
01:04:54,667 --> 01:04:57,977
The farm! One is going to make
itself to bawl by the judge.

674
01:04:58,107 --> 01:05:01,099
Mr., is the defense it lends?

675
01:05:01,227 --> 01:05:02,376
Quite, your Honor.

676
01:05:02,507 --> 01:05:04,543
Call your first witness then.

677
01:05:12,427 --> 01:05:14,497
The number of Sheldon Gunwald.

678
01:05:15,227 --> 01:05:17,104
It is I!

679
01:05:17,547 --> 01:05:20,107
It is not anymore the pain, I found it.

680
01:05:21,307 --> 01:05:22,626
You swear to say the truth,

681
01:05:22,787 --> 01:05:24,937
the whole truth, nothing that the truth?

682
01:05:25,907 --> 01:05:26,942
I swear it.

683
01:05:27,107 --> 01:05:28,745
You made me so happy!

684
01:05:33,907 --> 01:05:36,546
We will say rightly that M.
Gunwald is used in a service.

685
01:05:36,707 --> 01:05:40,382
We are going to begin the
questions with M. Hornung.

686
01:05:40,747 --> 01:05:43,625
I have more reasons to
call on your services

687
01:05:43,747 --> 01:05:45,738
that... my wife, for example?

688
01:05:47,027 --> 01:05:48,426
You lose 5 points.

689
01:05:48,947 --> 01:05:51,541
You have 45 of them.

690
01:05:52,027 --> 01:05:53,699
I yield my tower to Arlene.

691
01:05:54,387 --> 01:05:58,426
Sorry, the time is
urgent, I jump the cards.

692
01:05:58,547 --> 01:06:01,937
I inform you that M. Gunwald
practise the profession of spoon.

693
01:06:12,187 --> 01:06:13,620
Mr. Gunwald,

694
01:06:13,747 --> 01:06:17,217
in addition to your activity
of picker, he/it is not true...

695
01:06:17,347 --> 01:06:19,383
No, spoon!

696
01:06:19,787 --> 01:06:21,220
Ah yes, spoon.

697
01:06:22,947 --> 01:06:25,063
Evidently. Picker doesn't
want anything to say.

698
01:06:25,587 --> 01:06:30,342
Therefore Mr. Grunwald, in
more of your spoon activities,

699
01:06:31,107 --> 01:06:34,383
he/it is not exact that
you are monitor of conduct?

700
01:06:34,507 --> 01:06:35,576
No.

701
01:06:36,427 --> 01:06:38,497
- Is it then exact?
- Yes.

702
01:06:39,387 --> 01:06:41,139
You are not monitor of conduct?

703
01:06:41,267 --> 01:06:42,382
No.

704
01:06:43,267 --> 01:06:45,144
I contest these questions.

705
01:06:45,267 --> 01:06:46,620
Objection rejected.

706
01:06:46,747 --> 01:06:48,942
Then I would like to examine
the undersides of the business...

707
01:06:49,107 --> 01:06:50,335
Please.

708
01:06:54,227 --> 01:06:55,262
All is in place.

709
01:06:56,387 --> 01:06:58,139
Your witness, master.

710
01:06:58,907 --> 01:07:01,467
Please tell us your first name.

711
01:07:05,307 --> 01:07:06,501
Sheldon.

712
01:07:07,427 --> 01:07:08,985
Hey well, Mr. Grunwald,

713
01:07:09,427 --> 01:07:12,703
that wants to say... this gesture?

715
01:07:15,707 --> 01:07:18,460

716
01:07:22,667 --> 01:07:24,180
Mr. Grunwald,

717
01:07:24,747 --> 01:07:28,535
please tell us in what
cloth is made your shirt?

718
01:07:28,867 --> 01:07:31,540
Objection! This shirt goes from silk.

719
01:07:31,667 --> 01:07:32,986
Retained objection.

720
01:07:33,507 --> 01:07:34,860
Very well.

721
01:07:34,987 --> 01:07:39,344
Mr. Grunwald, please follow
me at the end of the room.

722
01:07:42,307 --> 01:07:44,502
Objection! The lawyer
operates the witness.

723
01:07:44,627 --> 01:07:45,742
Retained objection.

724
01:07:45,867 --> 01:07:50,065
Mr. Hornung, Mr. Taylor,
please approach the bench.

725
01:07:52,947 --> 01:07:55,222
While the judge converses
with the lawyers,

726
01:07:55,347 --> 01:07:58,180
let's mark one pause with this message.

727
01:08:02,707 --> 01:08:04,857
That makes our small skeptic, today?

728
01:08:04,987 --> 01:08:07,820
She/it has the cat in the Nesson oil.

729
01:08:13,867 --> 01:08:15,539
The judge is going to ask in M. Hornung

730
01:08:15,707 --> 01:08:17,823
to prove the applicability of the law.

731
01:08:17,987 --> 01:08:22,265
Mr. Hornung, you must prove
the applicability of the law.

732
01:08:22,467 --> 01:08:24,458
I not only go to prove it,

733
01:08:25,387 --> 01:08:28,345
but to show how these facts
relate to the business.

734
01:08:33,267 --> 01:08:35,258
I call to the rod

735
01:08:36,027 --> 01:08:37,585
Mile Rita Filagree.

736
01:08:40,867 --> 01:08:44,257
As everybody waited for itself
of it, a witness surprised!

737
01:08:44,387 --> 01:08:47,743
Filagree mile was in
the vehicle of Grunwald,

738
01:08:47,867 --> 01:08:50,097
but had been declared
dead after the accident.

739
01:08:52,667 --> 01:08:53,816
I swear it.

740
01:08:54,347 --> 01:08:57,976
Filagree mile, as passenger,
of the vehicle of M. Grunwald,

741
01:08:58,347 --> 01:09:01,464
can identify the driver
of the blue Buick?

742
01:09:01,987 --> 01:09:03,056
Yes.

743
01:09:04,267 --> 01:09:06,542
Is he/it in this court?

744
01:09:07,667 --> 01:09:08,816
Yes!

745
01:09:10,387 --> 01:09:12,617
Can you show it to me?

746
01:09:12,907 --> 01:09:14,386
I am not able to.

747
01:09:14,507 --> 01:09:16,702
I am not able to really.

748
01:09:16,907 --> 01:09:19,740
<i>Know yourselves the code
pénal </i> in this State?</i>

749
01:09:20,427 --> 01:09:24,056
You would not cry, if one
shouted to you over, hey?

750
01:09:24,227 --> 01:09:26,661
Ben no! But the girls,
it is not similar.

751
01:09:26,787 --> 01:09:29,824
When a type cries, one
takes it for a feeble.

752
01:09:29,947 --> 01:09:32,507
That then, Wally. Is necessary
to believe that have you reason.

753
01:09:33,267 --> 01:09:34,541
Dear Madam,

754
01:09:34,667 --> 01:09:37,022
to hide relative proofs

755
01:09:37,147 --> 01:09:39,581
to a crime as hateful...

756
01:09:42,067 --> 01:09:42,897
"Hêneux?"

757
01:09:43,947 --> 01:09:44,936
"Aineux?"

758
01:09:45,307 --> 01:09:47,263
II is necessary to say "Héneux."

759
01:09:47,387 --> 01:09:49,423
One doesn't say "your Héneur."

760
01:09:49,547 --> 01:09:52,744
No! Ladies and gentlemen,
it is written here.

761
01:09:53,147 --> 01:09:54,136
"Hyenas":

762
01:09:54,347 --> 01:09:58,420
Carnivorous animals and
nervous of Africa and Asia.

763
01:10:04,307 --> 01:10:05,626
Watch, Wally.

764
01:10:06,707 --> 01:10:08,106
Stop!

765
01:10:11,507 --> 01:10:14,067
Do you see? I knew that
one would make itself bawl.

766
01:10:14,907 --> 01:10:17,375
We don't want any pain to your planet.

767
01:10:20,427 --> 01:10:24,022
The accusation mocks of this court!

768
01:10:24,867 --> 01:10:26,266
Very well.

769
01:10:26,707 --> 01:10:28,663
He/it is over there seated.

770
01:10:33,987 --> 01:10:36,217
Oh, no. Him!

771
01:10:37,987 --> 01:10:42,219
The bailiff tried to identify
the driver of the blue Buick.

772
01:10:42,867 --> 01:10:45,665
Everybody waits with impatience

773
01:10:45,787 --> 01:10:47,505
