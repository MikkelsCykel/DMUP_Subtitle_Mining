1
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:06,338
- Permission to enter?
- Come.

2
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:13,982
Where's the rest of the company, captain?

3
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:16,713
Where do you think?
Moved out with the battalion.

4
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:18,618
I've been waiting here for you.

5
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:23,084
- You took your time getting back.
- I got lost in the smoke.

6
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,753
What happened to your gun?

7
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,525
Have you ever seen a shell-shocked horse?

8
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:32,966
He stomped all over me and got my rifle,
knocked it to smithereens.

9
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:39,478
Well, I suppose horses have as much right
to go crazy in this war as men have.

10
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,074
What do you think?

11
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,181
What the hell is it?

12
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:50,822
It's a "one." First Infantry Division.

13
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:54,321
The Red One. You think
General Pershing will like it?

14
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:58,658
- Oh, sure.
- I got the idea from a cap of a Hun I killed.

15
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:05,465
- When?
- Oh, about an hour ago.

16
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:08,269
Did he yell out anything?

17
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:12,571
Well, the same old kaiser stuff, you know,
"The war is over," all that junk.

18
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:15,974
- Finish it.
- Sir?

19
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,514
Finish it.

20
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:23,680
The armistice was signed
at 11:00 this morning.

21
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:27,954
The war's been over for four hours.

22
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:33,391
Well, you didn't know it was over.

23
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:38,361
He did.

24
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:43,442
<i>A quarter of a century later,</i>
<i>that piece of red cloth...</i>

25
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:47,010
<i>... from the dead Hun's hat had</i>
<i>become famous all over the world.</i>

26
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,149
<i>It was the insignia of</i>
<i>the 1 st Infantry Division.</i>

27
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:53,581
<i>The Fighting First, the Big Red One.</i>

28
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:12,901
<i>Twenty-four years later, the Big Red One</i>
<i>was fighting the Krauts again.</i>

29
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:18,237
<i>It was World War II this time.</i>
<i>We were invading North Africa.</i>

30
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:20,635
Hey, Griff.

31
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,174
Great! Thanks, sergeant.

32
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:25,442
<i>We were his rifle squad.</i>

33
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:29,850
<i>First Squad, 1 st Platoon,</i>
<i>I Company, 16th Infantry.</i>

34
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:32,513
<i>He called us his wet-noses.</i>

35
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:36,253
<i>Griff, he was a hell of a sharpshooter.</i>

36
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:42,462
<i>Johnson was a pig farmer</i>
<i>with hemorrhoids.</i>

37
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:50,665
<i>Vinci was a street kid who played hot jazz</i>
<i>on the saxophone, and that's me, I'm Zab.</i>

38
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:53,403
<i>I thought I was the Hemingway</i>
<i>of the Bronx.</i>

39
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:56,173
You really a book writer?

40
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,009
- Yeah.
- What book did you write?

41
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:01,119
<i>The Dark Deadline.</i>

42
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:04,145
- Never heard of it.
- Never read it.

43
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:08,657
It's an unpublished mystery novel.
I left it with my mother.

44
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:11,326
Why's a book writer a rifleman?

45
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:15,831
To come out with a war novel,
meathead. Why else, huh?

46
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:17,729
What about you, Griff?

47
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:20,998
You gonna be a cartoonist
for a big newspaper or something?

48
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,939
Say, Griff. You do everything left-handed?

49
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,136
Everything but shoot.
And play with my pecker.

50
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:34,079
"Watch out, Vichy.

51
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:40,188
Here comes the Big Red One."

52
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,022
Vichy?

53
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:45,654
I always thought Vichy
was some kind of soda pop.

54
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:48,665
No. Vichy's the French,
fighting on Hitler's side.

55
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:53,631
Yeah, that's why we're wearing these
so they don't shoot Americans, huh?

56
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,331
We dropped leaflets
so they know we're coming.

57
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:59,307
But if they start a fight,
we'll have to kill them.

58
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,642
<i>We were in this war to fight Germans,</i>
<i>not Frenchmen.</i>

59
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:07,348
<i>We were kind of hoping</i>
<i>they were feeling the same way.</i>

60
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:12,491
Put your rubbers on
and keep the salt water out.

61
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:13,682
Thanks, Griff.

62
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:18,454
I'll bet the guy that invented these...

63
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:22,624
...never figured they'd be used on a rifle.
- I never could screw with them.

64
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:24,099
How about you, Johnson?

65
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,065
Not me.

66
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:45,614
<i>Over on the Algerian beach, a lot of</i>
<i>French soldiers were reading our leaflets...</i>

67
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,658
<i>... and also wondering</i>
<i>if they were gonna fight.</i>

68
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:59,867
The colonel is stupid not to believe
these leaflets.

69
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:04,135
We are no good. You, me, all of us here.

70
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:09,043
Defending this miserable Algerian beach
for Marshal Pétain and Adolf Hitler.

71
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:16,614
I can't kill an American.

72
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:29,696
<i>There were four things</i>
<i>you could hear on the boat:</i>

73
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:32,736
<i>The waves, the engines...</i>

74
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:35,669
<i>... an occasional muffled prayer...</i>

75
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:40,039
<i>... and the sound of 50 guys</i>
<i>all heaving their guts out.</i>

76
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:54,555
<i>French troops, don't shoot.</i>
<i>We are Americans.</i>

77
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:05,669
<i>Don't shoot. We come to fight Hitler,</i>
<i>not to fight with you. Don't shoot.</i>

78
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:21,246
Hold your fire!

79
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:00,819
- Yes, colonel.
- Open fire.

80
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:03,620
Not on Americans.

81
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:17,867
Medic! Medic!

82
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,679
Nail him, Griff!

83
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:39,091
How the hell could you miss him?

84
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:41,859
Hell, he was close enough
to kiss on both cheeks.

85
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:53,269
What the hell's the matter with you?
I never saw you miss.

86
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:02,152
Medic! Over here.

87
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:18,436
Sixteenth Infantry, hold your fire!

88
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:22,040
Americans, this is Captain Chapier.

89
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,972
General Tavernier is dead.

90
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:29,812
Americans! I surrender my troops
to your hands.

91
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:33,950
Frenchmen, we do not accept
your surrender.

92
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,153
You surrender only to the enemy.

93
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:40,452
If you're Vichy, fight us.
If you're Frenchmen, join us!

94
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:13,623
<i>We were feeling cocky as hell.</i>

95
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:15,390
<i>Except Griff.</i>

96
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:17,825
<i>In the middle of the battle, he froze.</i>

97
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:33,973
<i>It got to Griff.</i>

98
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:37,073
<i>He kept away from the rest of us.</i>

99
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:42,215
<i>Nobody wanted to use</i>
<i>the word "coward," not yet.</i>

100
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:47,159
How come we're not pushing inland?

101
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:51,859
Red Company's carrying the ball.
Take your malaria pills.

102
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:03,338
Smoky-smoky for zigzag.
Smoky-smoky for zigzag.

103
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:17,782
Bladder juice.

104
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:25,721
- Jeez.
- Not bad.

105
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:29,232
Hey, how come you never miss?

106
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:31,528
They always take off backwards.

107
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:41,278
Smoky-smoky for zig-zig.
Smoky-smoky for girl.

108
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:45,076
And I'll bet you can get a whole harem
here for a pack of smokes.

109
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:48,448
Girl. <i>Z</i>ig-zig. Girl. <i>Z</i>ig-zig.

110
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:53,419
I wonder what they gave you in
the other war not to get a hard-on?

111
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:59,621
The same stuff you're wolfing down now.
It has saltpeter.

112
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:13,911
Griff's back.

113
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:52,976
I can't murder anybody.

114
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:57,215
We don't murder, we kill.

115
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,121
It's the same thing.

116
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,156
The hell it is, Griff.

117
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,794
You don't murder animals, you kill them.

118
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:31,348
<i>The truth is, none of us had</i>
<i>the faintest idea what war was all about.</i>

119
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:38,061
I'll send your relief up in an hour.

120
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:46,396
I'm not gonna tell you again,
no lights at night.

121
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,814
Third S<i>q</i>uad lost five men.

122
00:16:56,982 --> 00:17:00,713
I heard that they
bury wounded men alive.

123
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:08,520
- <i>K</i>now what else I heard?
- Tell it to the chaplain.

124
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,629
A lot of good he does
if you're buried alive.

125
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:15,532
Well, maybe it'll do him some good, huh?

126
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:21,002
Do you think Bedcheck Charlie's
gonna tuck us in again tonight?

127
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:25,906
Well, he's never on time. But a couple
of bombs and a little strafing...

128
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:31,382
...good for you. <i>K</i>eep you
on your toes, keep you alert.

129
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:36,887
<i>Hello, suckers of the Big Red One.</i>

130
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:40,787
<i>This is your German lovey-dovey</i>
<i>bringing you the latest war news.</i>

131
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:43,519
<i>The Germans are in Moscow.</i>

132
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,765
<i>Don't look for the truck</i>
<i>playing this record.</i>

133
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:52,704
<i>Seven Gls from the 34th Infantry</i>
<i>tried it last night...</i>

134
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:56,830
<i>... and they're deader than the</i>
<i>Unknown Soldier in Washington, D.C.</i>

135
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:02,712
<i>Adolf Hitler has nothing</i>
<i>against you American dogfaces.</i>

136
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:04,610
I wonder what she looks like.

137
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:08,913
If she's half as good as she sounds,
I'd eat her on sauerkraut.

138
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:12,251
<i>You know Hitler's beef is with England.</i>

139
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,327
Hey, how old do you think she is?

140
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:25,832
I'll bet she's old enough
to shove a swastika up her.

141
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:32,142
<i>All those limeys hate your guts</i>
<i>for licking them back in 1776.</i>

142
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:34,142
<i>Why fight for them?</i>

143
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:37,373
<i>K</i>nock off the bratwurst, Brunhilda.

144
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:39,779
And sing us a lullaby.

145
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,018
<i>I'll get to the song in a minute, honey.</i>

146
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:52,994
<i>Now, news from the good old U.S.A.</i>

147
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:58,736
<i>The workers in the defense plants</i>
<i>are striking for a raise in pay.</i>

148
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:03,705
<i>While you suckers are getting all of</i>
<i>$ 10 a month extra for combat pay...</i>

149
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:09,679
<i>... your wives, your sweethearts, are shacking</i>
<i>up with draft dodgers and deserters.</i>

150
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:17,785
<i>You think of your women back home</i>
<i>in the sack with these lucky, lucky 4-F's.</i>

151
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:40,506
<i>Z</i>ab.

152
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,716
Quit poking me with your rifle.

153
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,985
That's not my rifle, Johnson.

154
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:22,245
Sounds like we found the lost s<i>q</i>uad.

155
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:12,802
Where the hell's that radio?

156
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:15,269
- Where's the radio?
- Dead!

157
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,103
Pull the s<i>q</i>uad back to those arches.
I'm gonna see what's on the left.

158
00:22:53,071 --> 00:22:55,437
Chapier, blind that tank.

159
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:55,423
Get these horses out of here.
This is gonna blow. Move out!

160
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:03,737
Will you get them out? Get them out,
get them out! This is gonna blow.

161
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:10,031
I never smoke them.

162
00:25:17,782 --> 00:25:19,909
Lieutenant just got word from Battalion.

163
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:23,384
No more swapping smokes
with the Goums for <i>K</i>raut ears.

164
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:26,222
The Goums have been
cutting off American ears.

165
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:29,554
Sergeant, my Goums never kill Americans.

166
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:32,925
I didn't say killing them.
I said, cutting their ears off.

167
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:34,531
But these are <i>K</i>raut ears.

168
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:38,999
After a fight, you can't tell the difference
between an American and a <i>K</i>raut ear...

169
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:41,798
...so there will be no more
swapping cigarettes...

170
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:46,433
...for any kind of an ear.
Not in my s<i>q</i>uad.

171
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:34,425
Communications Center caught
an American bomb.

172
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:38,723
These wet-noses found the phonograph
and one record undamaged.

173
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:41,725
Look at the faces
of these puppies, Schroeder.

174
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:45,395
They think the Horst Wessel song is so...

175
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:52,774
Horst Wessel was a pimp who supplied
Hitler with baby faces like you.

176
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:56,846
He was killed in a brawl,
over a whore in Berlin.

177
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:04,078
A poem by a pimp became
the hymn of Hitler's party.

178
00:27:04,356 --> 00:27:06,347
Is that right, Schroeder?

179
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:11,788
Don't want to disillusion
these infants, huh?

180
00:27:12,597 --> 00:27:14,462
You're getting soft.

181
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:19,967
Schroeder used to be tough. In Libya,
I saw him murder a German officer.

182
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:23,303
I didn't murder him, Gerd,
I killed him...

183
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:25,909
...when he ran from a fight
with the British.

184
00:27:26,077 --> 00:27:29,945
Murder. <i>K</i>illed. It's the same thing.

185
00:27:30,115 --> 00:27:32,515
We don't murder the enemy, we kill.

186
00:27:34,185 --> 00:27:35,880
Everything is on the move.

187
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:38,648
Battalion is sending us
to the <i>K</i>asserine Pass.

188
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:41,917
- We're going to choke on panzer fumes.
- Not me, Schroeder.

189
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:45,290
Let Rommel's panzer grenadiers
march behind those tanks.

190
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:48,655
But not me. I want no more.

191
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:51,063
I'm no damn Nazi fanatic like you.

192
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:55,533
Germany is through singing
for Adolf Hitler.

193
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:16,651
<i>Our brilliant generals had figured...</i>

194
00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:19,956
<i>... that Rommel's push would come</i>
<i>at a place called Speava...</i>

195
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:22,998
<i>... so they massed most</i>
<i>of the Allied forces over there.</i>

196
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:25,693
<i>But they sent our regiment</i>
<i>around the back way...</i>

197
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,771
<i>... through a shit-hole called</i>
<i>the Kasserine Pass.</i>

198
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:31,966
<i>Our squad was on point.</i>
<i>We got an eyeful, all right.</i>

199
00:28:32,143 --> 00:28:35,772
<i>The whole damned Afrika Korps was</i>
<i>coming through the Kasserine Pass.</i>

200
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:38,472
<i>Rommel had caught us</i>
<i>with our pants down.</i>

201
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,262
We got tanks, boys,
and infantry with them.

202
00:28:58,636 --> 00:29:02,367
They'll be looking behind the rocks
for antitank guns, so let's go!

203
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,701
- Oh, shit.
- Let's go.

204
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:26,789
Sergeant, where are we gonna run to?
They'll spot us out in the open.

205
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:31,163
- We're not running, we're digging in.
- Digging in? Are you crazy, sergeant?

206
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:35,337
All right. Dig in and let them roll
over our heads.

207
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:34,288
Hey, they're going off to the right!

208
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:36,950
Guess again, jerk-off. Look over there.

209
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:28,562
Tanks! They're all over the place!

210
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:08,601
You are in a temporary
German hospital in Tunis, sergeant.

211
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:13,376
The war is over for you.
We won. You lost.

212
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:15,212
I speak good English.

213
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:20,048
Our doctors cannot understand
what is keeping you alive.

214
00:34:23,961 --> 00:34:27,021
How could such a decayed country
like America...

215
00:34:27,198 --> 00:34:30,759
...produce such a magnificent soldier
like you?

216
00:34:30,935 --> 00:34:34,371
You are a very beautiful man, sergeant.

217
00:34:42,146 --> 00:34:44,512
I adore supermen.

218
00:34:56,561 --> 00:35:02,625
I can understand your being horny,
Fritz, but you've got bad breath.

219
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:49,037
We'd better get out of here.

220
00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:51,777
You heard what that orderly said.

221
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:56,081
This is an unmarked hospital,
and they'd just as soon blast us.

222
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:19,835
Anybody here from the Big Red One?

223
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,103
Sixteenth.

224
00:36:22,813 --> 00:36:24,747
Eighteenth!

225
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,358
Where's that Big Red One man?

226
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,123
What happened at the pass?

227
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:43,130
You with the 16th?

228
00:36:43,734 --> 00:36:45,668
You one of them goons?

229
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:48,297
I Company, 3rd Battalion.

230
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:52,067
What are you doing wrapped up
in that Arab bed sheet?

231
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:56,441
- What happened at the pass?
- We counterattacked after you jokers ran.

232
00:36:56,614 --> 00:37:01,779
We took <i>K</i>asserine, Gafsa,
El Guettar, Tunis.

233
00:37:01,953 --> 00:37:07,118
- We ran Rommel right out of Africa.
- You mean the Big Red One took Tunis.

234
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:08,849
We sure as hell did.

235
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:17,363
This is Tunis.

236
00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:39,214
You're right.

237
00:37:40,524 --> 00:37:41,923
We took Tunis.

238
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,024
Where's the 1 st S<i>q</i>uad?

239
00:38:19,196 --> 00:38:20,959
Where's the 1 st S<i>q</i>uad?

240
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:39,947
<i>Out of the original 12-man rifle squad,</i>
<i>the four of us were the only ones left.</i>

241
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:41,701
<i>This invasion wasn't gonna</i>
<i>be like North Africa.</i>

242
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:44,109
<i>The beach would be heavily defended.</i>

243
00:39:44,281 --> 00:39:49,116
<i>So now at least, we could all go</i>
<i>to Sicily and get killed together.</i>

244
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:04,262
I gave the supply officer a Luger for it.

245
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:08,770
By the way, what were you doing
in that Arab bed sheet?

246
00:40:08,939 --> 00:40:11,032
They were shanghaiing
all the combats...

247
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:14,644
...and noncoms and training
replacements for those rebel devils.

248
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:19,879
Where'd you steal it, stupe?

249
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:25,044
My name's Shep, not "stupe." I got it
from the St. George Hotel in Algiers.

250
00:40:25,389 --> 00:40:28,881
I understand you're an Italian, Vinci.

251
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:31,789
How come they let a wop
in this man's Army?

252
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:36,088
I don't think a wop's
gonna fight a wop.

253
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:41,398
I think all you'll do is drink dago red
and sing "O Sole Mio."

254
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:02,615
I like "O Sole Mio."

255
00:41:58,749 --> 00:42:02,276
<i>The creepy thing about battle</i>
<i>is that you always feel alone.</i>

256
00:42:02,453 --> 00:42:04,978
<i>All you can see are the guys</i>
<i>right next to you...</i>

257
00:42:05,155 --> 00:42:07,316
<i>... and the bodies you keep tripping over.</i>

258
00:42:20,971 --> 00:42:22,063
Sergeant!

259
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:28,535
- Sergeant!
- Ho!

260
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:30,976
- Throw me a hot one!
- I'm out of them!

261
00:42:31,515 --> 00:42:32,743
Johnson!

262
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:38,889
- Johnson!
- Ho!

263
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:41,820
- Throw me some live ones.
- I'm out of them.

264
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:47,028
- <i>Z</i>ab.
- Ho!

265
00:42:47,197 --> 00:42:48,357
Throw me live ones.

266
00:42:48,532 --> 00:42:50,523
I'm out! Griff!

267
00:42:52,202 --> 00:42:53,897
- Griff!
- Ho!

268
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:55,561
Throw me live ones!

269
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:59,402
I'm all out. Hey, Shep, you got
any grenades on you?

270
00:43:01,211 --> 00:43:02,701
Shep?

271
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:04,613
Shep?

272
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:14,151
Shep.

273
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:16,353
You chicken bastard.

274
00:43:16,527 --> 00:43:19,621
Hey, <i>Z</i>ab. I got some live ones for you.

275
00:43:22,299 --> 00:43:24,665
- Johnson!
- Sergeant!

276
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:26,893
Vinci!

277
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:33,368
Give me another one!

278
00:43:33,744 --> 00:43:35,143
<i>Z</i>ab!

279
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:39,478
- Johnson!
- Sergeant!

280
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:41,709
Vinci!

281
00:44:07,143 --> 00:44:11,443
Why are we always sent out? It's the only
damn s<i>q</i>uad in the whole U.S. Army?

282
00:44:11,614 --> 00:44:14,640
- Where's the rest of the Army?
- There are eight patrols...

283
00:44:14,817 --> 00:44:17,308
...checking the villages for diehard snipers.

284
00:44:17,954 --> 00:44:20,354
Anybody wants to transfer,
just let me know.

285
00:44:21,457 --> 00:44:23,254
I want to transfer.

286
00:44:23,426 --> 00:44:26,259
Okay, Vinci. You're transferred to the point.

287
00:44:40,409 --> 00:44:42,707
<i>You know how you smoke out a sniper?</i>

288
00:44:42,878 --> 00:44:46,439
<i>You send a guy out in the open</i>
<i>and you see if he gets shot.</i>

289
00:44:46,616 --> 00:44:49,642
<i>They thought that one up at West Point.</i>

290
00:44:54,423 --> 00:44:57,017
- Are you okay, sergeant?
- Why?

291
00:44:57,193 --> 00:45:01,721
- You just let Vinci walk into a sniper.
- That's why he's here.

292
00:45:01,897 --> 00:45:04,889
We got plenty of wet-noses here too.

293
00:45:05,434 --> 00:45:07,959
You really want to finish
that book, don't you?

294
00:45:08,137 --> 00:45:09,832
That's why I'm here.

295
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:29,521
Vinci made it.

296
00:45:29,692 --> 00:45:32,957
Come on, Carlos, your turn.
Let's go. Come on!

297
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:56,843
- Hey, Vinci?
- Ho!

298
00:45:57,019 --> 00:45:58,418
You know where he lives!

299
00:45:59,288 --> 00:46:03,588
Work to your right, I'll go left.
It's your ball.

300
00:46:55,644 --> 00:46:57,441
Bravo! Bravo!

301
00:47:01,884 --> 00:47:05,320
- You had him in the sights all the time.
- All the time.

302
00:47:05,488 --> 00:47:07,581
You just wanted to see me sweat.

303
00:47:07,757 --> 00:47:12,717
It's punishment for transferring me to the
point. May I rejoin the rear echelon now?

304
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:16,456
You are transferred back to the point.

305
00:47:21,570 --> 00:47:23,902
Oh, my aching butt.

306
00:47:24,073 --> 00:47:26,564
<i>By now, we'd come to look</i>
<i>at all replacements...</i>

307
00:47:26,742 --> 00:47:30,200
<i>... as dead men who temporarily</i>
<i>had the use of their arms and legs.</i>

308
00:47:30,379 --> 00:47:32,711
<i>They came and went so fast</i>
<i>and so regular...</i>

309
00:47:32,882 --> 00:47:36,113
<i>... that sometimes we didn't even</i>
<i>get to know their names.</i>

310
00:47:36,285 --> 00:47:41,018
<i>Truth is, after a while we sort of avoided</i>
<i>getting to know them.</i>

311
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:47,020
L... I brought some water.

312
00:47:56,071 --> 00:47:59,529
Do you know what they call
you four guys down at Battalion?

313
00:47:59,975 --> 00:48:02,205
Sergeant's Four Horsemen.

314
00:48:02,378 --> 00:48:06,280
I don't get it. You guys lived
through North Africa.

315
00:48:07,016 --> 00:48:08,984
You didn't even get a scratch.

316
00:48:09,151 --> 00:48:12,917
That's because replacements
keep getting hit instead of us.

317
00:48:13,088 --> 00:48:16,319
You think...? You think maybe I'll get it?

318
00:48:24,266 --> 00:48:26,791
Why not? You something special?

319
00:48:51,093 --> 00:48:53,027
I'll go get some, all right?

320
00:48:53,195 --> 00:48:56,460
I'll... Excuse me.

321
00:49:02,204 --> 00:49:03,967
Water.

322
00:49:27,963 --> 00:49:32,093
You'll live, Smitty.
You did tripwire the mine.

323
00:49:32,501 --> 00:49:36,232
They're not designed to kill you,
just to castrate you.

324
00:49:37,039 --> 00:49:38,700
Castrate me?!

325
00:49:40,242 --> 00:49:42,267
Oh, my God!

326
00:49:43,078 --> 00:49:46,707
Hey, here it is. I found it.

327
00:49:46,882 --> 00:49:50,511
Hey, that's my cock! Give it back to me!
Give me back my cock!

328
00:49:50,686 --> 00:49:52,711
It's just one of your balls, Smitty.

329
00:49:52,888 --> 00:49:55,857
You can live without it.
That's why they gave you two.

330
00:50:08,003 --> 00:50:11,530
I still got my cock! I still got it!

331
00:50:12,207 --> 00:50:14,471
I got my cock!

332
00:50:28,357 --> 00:50:30,518
They're supposed to be
coming this way.

333
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:33,084
Hold it up.

334
00:50:35,230 --> 00:50:36,697
I said, hold it up!

335
00:50:37,633 --> 00:50:39,100
I'm eating.

336
00:50:46,508 --> 00:50:48,271
Okay, let's try this.

337
00:50:48,877 --> 00:50:50,242
Come on.

338
00:50:59,054 --> 00:51:02,023
- <i>K</i>eep an eye peeled for snakes.
- Yeah, and bats.

339
00:51:02,191 --> 00:51:04,887
Bats? I love bats.

340
00:51:33,856 --> 00:51:36,188
Sergeant, what's the word
from Head<i>q</i>uarters?

341
00:51:36,358 --> 00:51:38,519
Yeah, what did the lieutenant say?

342
00:51:38,694 --> 00:51:44,428
The lieutenant said that Hermann Goring's
panzers overran the 2nd Battalion.

343
00:51:48,003 --> 00:51:50,096
If they break through the division...

344
00:51:50,672 --> 00:51:52,264
...we're in the sea.

345
00:51:52,608 --> 00:51:54,599
- Where are they headed?
- Right for us.

346
00:51:55,010 --> 00:51:56,978
Our big guns will clobber them.

347
00:51:57,312 --> 00:52:00,509
- They're still on the water.
- None of them have unloaded yet?

348
00:52:01,683 --> 00:52:03,310
Not yet.

349
00:52:06,455 --> 00:52:08,116
Patton's got tanks.

350
00:52:09,658 --> 00:52:11,489
Still on the water.

351
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:15,357
Jesus. We're sitting in our own coffin.

352
00:52:22,938 --> 00:52:25,168
<i>We knew he wanted to run for it...</i>

353
00:52:25,641 --> 00:52:27,233
<i>... but we knew he wouldn't...</i>

354
00:52:27,409 --> 00:52:29,036
<i>... way before he did.</i>

355
00:52:29,978 --> 00:52:33,072
<i>Anyway, the sergeant</i>
<i>would've shot him if he tried it.</i>
