1
00:00:03,567 --> 00:00:07,424
And in the end of the Ice Age
the machine came...

2
00:00:07,721 --> 00:00:11,684
...it came from the outside,
it came from the space.

3
00:00:11,959 --> 00:00:14,073
It came for one purpose,

4
00:00:14,244 --> 00:00:17,617
to change the men into mutants.

5
00:00:23,819 --> 00:00:33,462
MUTANT CHRONICLES

6
00:01:18,627 --> 00:01:20,828
After much suffering and death,

7
00:01:21,012 --> 00:01:25,446
a warrior Nagh-Than,
united the ancient tribes of men,

8
00:01:26,827 --> 00:01:32,332
together, they sealed
the deadly machine, in the deep of earth.

9
00:01:50,064 --> 00:01:52,353
In distant mountains
of the eastern Europe

10
00:01:52,615 --> 00:01:58,425
only the brotherhood descending of Nagh-Than,
kept the knowledge of the machine alive,

11
00:01:58,583 --> 00:02:04,044
in histories... in myths,
and sacred book of chronicles.

12
00:02:05,019 --> 00:02:07,700
THE YEAR 2707

13
00:02:08,779 --> 00:02:10,545
Years later,

14
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:13,928
four corporations governed the world,

15
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,014
Mishima, in the east,

16
00:02:16,205 --> 00:02:19,237
Bauhaus and Imperial in Europe and Africa,

17
00:02:19,455 --> 00:02:21,572
Capitol, in the west...

18
00:02:22,803 --> 00:02:28,148
Each corporation fights each other,
for the few resources are remained,

19
00:02:28,355 --> 00:02:31,145
in a world without end...

20
00:02:32,196 --> 00:02:34,758
In the many places of Europe,

21
00:02:34,939 --> 00:02:39,289
The Bauhaus corporation prepared
for another attack in the lines of Capitol.

22
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:42,616
Between them, in deep...

23
00:02:42,808 --> 00:02:46,010
the machine still waits.

24
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,628
Those bastards... Many of shit...

25
00:03:04,429 --> 00:03:06,397
Fire.

26
00:03:07,716 --> 00:03:09,773
incoming...

27
00:03:22,518 --> 00:03:24,417
Enjoy!

28
00:03:29,562 --> 00:03:32,058
Good, it could be worse...

29
00:03:42,953 --> 00:03:44,846
only follows me alive, right.

30
00:03:48,717 --> 00:03:50,678
I want you to destroy them!

31
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,494
You will now fight!

32
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,605
I want to see only ashes remaining!

33
00:03:57,182 --> 00:03:58,842
Advance!

34
00:04:12,191 --> 00:04:15,406
- Did the patrol come back?
- What is that...

35
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:17,380
Sir.

36
00:04:30,292 --> 00:04:33,272
Who takes care of the wounds?

37
00:04:58,258 --> 00:05:01,425
- What happens?
- The artillery does not stop to shoot.

38
00:05:01,692 --> 00:05:04,145
- How many losses?
- 5 aerial units.

39
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:06,622
- Shit.
- we left them behind...

40
00:05:06,864 --> 00:05:09,804
and we marked the position,
the enemy was just behind.

41
00:05:10,011 --> 00:05:12,294
After finishing with this, we will look
for them. Just another day!

42
00:05:12,793 --> 00:05:15,300
fucking up to us.

43
00:05:23,826 --> 00:05:25,495
Here they come.

44
00:05:26,294 --> 00:05:29,448
I assume that he will not smoke more.

45
00:05:40,301 --> 00:05:45,091
Thanks Father,
I feel like better with this.

46
00:05:46,124 --> 00:05:48,608
Sergeant, Want the blessing?

47
00:05:48,897 --> 00:05:50,681
go away to hell.

48
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,581
you do not create that,
already has been there,

49
00:05:55,528 --> 00:05:57,341
approaches, come fast.

50
00:05:57,802 --> 00:05:59,697
Any minute will be the last one.

51
00:06:03,505 --> 00:06:05,807
here a surprise...

52
00:06:06,423 --> 00:06:08,419
are shouting to leave the box,

53
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:10,737
what matters...

54
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:12,828
Of what you speak?

55
00:06:13,017 --> 00:06:15,691
you have taken one whenever we fought...

56
00:06:16,015 --> 00:06:18,493
single one we are again here.

57
00:06:19,396 --> 00:06:24,441
- I do not make it single by the money,
- They give extra money.You when there is but low.

58
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:31,216
Some times I think we believe in the misfortune
that it would cause to us to lose.

59
00:06:32,524 --> 00:06:35,026
do not pay me believe Sir.

60
00:06:35,385 --> 00:06:37,060
absouletly right,

61
00:06:37,304 --> 00:06:40,394
They pay you... to win shit war!

62
00:06:45,881 --> 00:06:48,101
Down.

63
00:06:52,503 --> 00:06:53,942
this is it

64
00:06:54,118 --> 00:06:56,019
Move... move...

65
00:06:57,154 --> 00:06:58,961
Come on boys

66
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:00,963
Down.

67
00:07:19,857 --> 00:07:21,531
Come on ladies.

68
00:07:21,783 --> 00:07:23,786
time to war fight.

69
00:07:24,091 --> 00:07:25,262
Wait my order...

70
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:36,201
Easy one...

71
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:41,404
Easy...

72
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:48,663
Fire!

73
00:08:19,357 --> 00:08:21,569
incoming...

74
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:24,011
Gas!

75
00:09:17,419 --> 00:09:18,965
Fuck.

76
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:22,590
you were going to shoot to me.

77
00:09:22,848 --> 00:09:24,614
for a second I was

78
00:09:24,829 --> 00:09:27,476
We need to leave here, coordinate soldiers.

79
00:09:29,006 --> 00:09:30,815
Can I just buy a drink.

80
00:09:46,408 --> 00:09:48,914
we cannot move, damn

81
00:09:49,746 --> 00:09:51,710
it looks for its weak point, come on.

82
00:09:59,496 --> 00:10:01,594
You keep that fucking hat soldier

83
00:11:04,082 --> 00:11:09,216
Our soldiers did not do this.

84
00:11:38,778 --> 00:11:42,179
Fuck... body pieces.

85
00:11:42,626 --> 00:11:44,539
Mother fuckers!

86
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:01,902
Jesus...

87
00:12:14,014 --> 00:12:15,359
What was that?

88
00:12:15,746 --> 00:12:17,298
Murderer!

89
00:12:33,922 --> 00:12:35,843
Put your weapons...

90
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:37,732
Wait.. wait.. easy,

91
00:12:38,228 --> 00:12:40,647
My men did not do this.

92
00:12:40,863 --> 00:12:43,414
- So you will kill me?
- Yeah.

93
00:12:50,306 --> 00:12:51,817
What is that?

94
00:14:26,082 --> 00:14:28,039
Fucking mutants...

95
00:14:28,301 --> 00:14:30,341
Come to me..

96
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:32,480
Where are the others?

97
00:14:32,902 --> 00:14:34,658
anybody else... Let's go...

98
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:57,680
In the first one,

99
00:16:58,209 --> 00:17:00,098
had a battle in the sky...

100
00:17:04,054 --> 00:17:06,063
and started badly.

101
00:17:06,346 --> 00:17:09,588
They had fought with everything,
but it could not stop.

102
00:17:09,882 --> 00:17:11,827
Consumed by the hatred,

103
00:17:12,874 --> 00:17:17,208
created an image of the enemy.

104
00:17:25,372 --> 00:17:29,152
and replaced, to its own soldiers.

105
00:17:30,084 --> 00:17:33,805
Nagh-Than, founder of our order,

106
00:17:34,156 --> 00:17:37,284
assembled to the ancient tribes,

107
00:17:37,553 --> 00:17:40,940
together, they defeated the enemy...

108
00:17:41,194 --> 00:17:44,597
and sealed the machines in deep of Earth.

109
00:18:05,758 --> 00:18:12,458
Released of their prison, the mutants
draged everybody...

110
00:18:13,514 --> 00:18:16,124
to the hole, and in the depths of ground,

111
00:18:16,388 --> 00:18:19,952
the machine began to turn again...

112
00:18:20,343 --> 00:18:22,604
changing the course to die...

113
00:18:22,873 --> 00:18:26,656
Changing the enemy of the man.

114
00:18:57,999 --> 00:19:02,872
the chronicles promised to us that someone
will rise and follow footprints of Nagh-Than,

115
00:19:03,099 --> 00:19:07,867
lowering to the same hell, and freeing
the humanity of the machines.

116
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:12,947
I travelled to see the corporations, to
convince them to follow the prophecy,

117
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,749
and to defeat the enemy of the man.

118
00:19:37,569 --> 00:19:40,672
How much time do we have?

119
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:43,597
Days, less maybe.

120
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:46,158
Begin to the evacuation?

121
00:19:46,406 --> 00:19:48,162
Evacuation?

122
00:19:50,184 --> 00:19:58,504
Move to keep away from all the colonies,
and then we can resource the situation.

123
00:19:58,776 --> 00:20:01,619
You want to say to me that the Earth will
leave?

124
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,820
Yes brother. You understand well.

125
00:20:06,577 --> 00:20:08,585
we are finished here.

126
00:20:08,842 --> 00:20:11,094
leave with all their ships?

127
00:20:11,278 --> 00:20:14,215
How many millions do you think to
leave behind?

128
00:20:14,767 --> 00:20:17,317
and do you think that the enemy will stop
with this world?

129
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:20,164
They won't, They'll follow you.

130
00:20:21,606 --> 00:20:24,244
will follow you without mattering
where you run.

131
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:28,725
There is still hope...

132
00:20:34,979 --> 00:20:36,394
What hope?

133
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:38,383
To fulfill the prophecy.

134
00:20:38,626 --> 00:20:39,823
Give me 20 soldiers and a ship.

135
00:20:40,022 --> 00:20:43,332
What can these 20 that our armies
could not...

136
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:45,604
Can go to where the army cannot arrive.

137
00:20:45,769 --> 00:20:49,691
Can arrive down at the Earth, can destroy
to the machine.

138
00:20:52,462 --> 00:20:54,229
I know what must be thinking,

139
00:20:56,532 --> 00:20:58,405
but I am a faith man.

140
00:20:58,622 --> 00:21:00,520
I'm asking...

141
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,194
I'm begging,

142
00:21:06,013 --> 00:21:08,120
have faith.

143
00:21:08,646 --> 00:21:11,333
Not in me, not even in this...

144
00:21:11,597 --> 00:21:13,527
but in the humanity,

145
00:21:14,412 --> 00:21:19,524
faith, one that would leave
behind deserve a chance.

146
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:08,794
imagine that this day goes to live well.

147
00:23:09,093 --> 00:23:11,412
You should have gone Brother

148
00:23:11,663 --> 00:23:14,006
the barricades are crumbling,

149
00:23:14,845 --> 00:23:16,649
will arrive soon.

150
00:23:16,866 --> 00:23:20,346
- When do you leave?
- The absence of gravity interferes with...

151
00:23:20,523 --> 00:23:26,248
...my digestion, so... I should stay.

152
00:23:30,859 --> 00:23:35,908
but will not be giving returned in
circles, making same mistakes

153
00:23:43,401 --> 00:23:45,602
where will you go?

154
00:23:46,118 --> 00:23:50,170
I should... return to my brothers and
sisters.

155
00:23:51,901 --> 00:23:54,132
How do you get there?

156
00:23:59,922 --> 00:24:02,517
These should be a God's wills?

157
00:24:05,841 --> 00:24:08,671
Yes, absouletly..

158
00:24:10,269 --> 00:24:14,201
I have a ship, you won't hold 20,

159
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,539
you have to make this less.

160
00:24:17,751 --> 00:24:19,462
Take these.

161
00:24:20,369 --> 00:24:22,197
What are they?

162
00:24:22,521 --> 00:24:24,732
Offroad tickets.

163
00:24:24,987 --> 00:24:28,551
they should help you to recruit men for your
mission.

164
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,485
why are you doing this?

165
00:24:33,752 --> 00:24:40,050
Many Man think they are going to die,
brother. A few of us know it.

166
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:50,062
and while I approach more in the end,
encounter that the hope is the unique
thing that calls my attention.

167
00:24:50,482 --> 00:24:55,215
Sir, the barricades has fallen, is
inside. Your ship is ready.

168
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:58,826
I'm staying, but brother Samuel will be
traveling with you.

169
00:24:58,958 --> 00:25:00,288
Take him to where he wants to go.

170
00:25:00,467 --> 00:25:03,741
Brother Samuel, we have very little time..

171
00:25:07,149 --> 00:25:09,034
God bless you.

172
00:25:09,577 --> 00:25:13,284
I sincerely hope so brother.

173
00:25:13,934 --> 00:25:16,130
Brother Samuel?

174
00:25:16,843 --> 00:25:20,526
Are you the one? Will you deliver us?

175
00:25:20,718 --> 00:25:23,658
Pray the God that I am.

176
00:26:11,659 --> 00:26:14,332
Do you,evil, have a name?

177
00:26:41,357 --> 00:26:43,714
- Mitch?
- Ady.

178
00:26:45,524 --> 00:26:47,297
Nathan is not here.

179
00:26:48,133 --> 00:26:49,966
Yeah I know...

180
00:26:50,477 --> 00:26:52,573
please come in.

181
00:26:59,837 --> 00:27:01,879
I make some tea.

182
00:27:03,483 --> 00:27:06,007
- My God, you changed.
- Yes.

183
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:09,521
How long you have not been here.
You look like different.

184
00:27:10,316 --> 00:27:12,367
- You remember Grace?
- Yes.

185
00:27:12,722 --> 00:27:14,569
Yes, Madam

186
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:19,317
She is 10 now. 10 years old.

187
00:27:19,982 --> 00:27:24,297
Which means almost 5 years since that
the vestment.

188
00:27:27,497 --> 00:27:29,813
Here it is tea

189
00:27:31,231 --> 00:27:33,403
Nobody told you?

190
00:27:33,751 --> 00:27:35,813
Nobody told me anything.

191
00:27:38,644 --> 00:27:40,851
On behalf of...

192
00:27:52,095 --> 00:27:57,021
In behalf of the executive vice-president
I have been authorized to inform you...

193
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:01,946
that captain Nathan Rooker has been
missing...

194
00:28:02,378 --> 00:28:04,750
in the action.

195
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:10,939
I have dreams, I could see him.

196
00:28:13,124 --> 00:28:17,657
he is still alive, I know
he is still alive,

197
00:28:17,884 --> 00:28:19,754
Listen

198
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:23,516
if you think therefore you gonna drive so
crazy.

199
00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:27,049
You have to think about Grace.

200
00:28:27,269 --> 00:28:30,624
and they just expect us we were here until
he died?

201
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:34,749
I do not know as to say

202
00:29:02,145 --> 00:29:04,157
Leave it

203
00:29:20,302 --> 00:29:21,979
Sergeant Hunter?

204
00:29:23,716 --> 00:29:27,408
The name was suggested by a soldier of
his squad.

205
00:29:27,613 --> 00:29:29,296
Jesus Barrier.

206
00:29:29,484 --> 00:29:31,136
What he wants?

207
00:29:31,335 --> 00:29:33,359
I need soldiers for a mission

208
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:39,422
What enemy?

209
00:29:40,033 --> 00:29:41,830
The enemy of the man.

210
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:45,376
I do not expect any of us will survive,

211
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:47,358
but, it is a chance.

212
00:29:49,562 --> 00:29:51,070
maybe save the world,

213
00:29:54,794 --> 00:29:58,044
fuck mankind,fuck the world.

214
00:30:03,663 --> 00:30:05,170
fuck you...

215
00:30:06,296 --> 00:30:07,585
Yeah

216
00:30:08,526 --> 00:30:12,020
Barrier said me like that

217
00:30:13,497 --> 00:30:15,832
He also said that...

218
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:21,386
you needed to get out of this hell, but...

219
00:30:22,617 --> 00:30:26,142
these will get you out the hell.

220
00:30:27,872 --> 00:30:31,719
But maybe put you wrong.

221
00:31:22,344 --> 00:31:25,611
the tickets was the life, everyone wanted one

222
00:31:25,864 --> 00:31:28,489
But, who would take this offer?

223
00:31:28,772 --> 00:31:34,054
Jesus Barrier, he would not go away unless
it promised to him that her mother would go to the Heaven,

224
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:35,545
I did it.

225
00:31:35,752 --> 00:31:37,802
God forgive me.

226
00:31:38,054 --> 00:31:42,066
John McGuire, the only soldier who refused
the tickets,

227
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:46,846
are the type of man who saves without
sacrificing.

228
00:31:47,994 --> 00:31:54,976
Valerie Duval, a single mother with 61
kills, so young.

229
00:31:55,523 --> 00:32:00,224
Juba Kim Wu, when I told him that non of
us would coming back...

230
00:32:00,438 --> 00:32:02,657
He just smiled.

231
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:07,071
Maximillian Von Steiner, an officer and
aristocrat,

232
00:32:10,774 --> 00:32:12,510
the chronicles tell...

233
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:16,606
that the enemy will expand everywhere,

234
00:32:16,834 --> 00:32:19,457
marking the end of ours were...

235
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:21,733
but,

236
00:32:22,093 --> 00:32:26,374
also profess the survival of the man.

237
00:32:30,863 --> 00:32:32,859
and will free to us of the destruction.

238
00:32:39,314 --> 00:32:41,864
That follows the prophecy,

239
00:32:42,153 --> 00:32:47,085
we now, we are prevailed without opposition.

240
00:32:57,887 --> 00:33:00,115
Brother.

241
00:33:01,087 --> 00:33:04,010
- How is it?
- it is good

242
00:33:05,695 --> 00:33:07,717
6 weeks ago,

243
00:33:07,984 --> 00:33:11,892
between a shock of artillery between
Bauhaus and Capitol,

244
00:33:13,185 --> 00:33:15,167
and your friend?

245
00:33:18,721 --> 00:33:22,990
In the ruins of the imperial city of
Caino, one old cathedral exists,

246
00:33:23,243 --> 00:33:27,304
their catacombs opens a network of
underground tunnels.

247
00:33:27,576 --> 00:33:29,571
We travel along these tunnels,

248
00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:33,047
to find the machine and to destroy

249
00:33:33,233 --> 00:33:34,233
and all?

250
00:33:34,405 --> 00:33:36,172
Simply to destroy them.

251
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:38,137
We have a device.

252
00:33:45,307 --> 00:33:49,576
from the first battle with the mutants,
started of the machine,

253
00:33:49,792 --> 00:33:52,000
before they were buried.

254
00:33:52,859 --> 00:33:54,294
so it is a bomb?

255
00:33:55,254 --> 00:33:56,726
we do not know.

256
00:33:57,752 --> 00:33:59,106
But we think it is.

257
00:33:59,316 --> 00:34:03,458
- You think so?
- Our information comes from ancient writings,letuanent

258
00:34:04,436 --> 00:34:06,578
we do not have an insctruction manual.

259
00:34:10,469 --> 00:34:13,887
the chronicle show it
it goes in the center of the machine...

260
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:17,511
it is covered with symbols which
we think covering warnings

261
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:19,812
- How it is safe to transport?
- What it matters that, McGuire?

262
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,377
You can call me captain, Steiner
And yes...

263
00:34:22,891 --> 00:34:24,945
I hope that it is stable when we arrive.

264
00:34:25,127 --> 00:34:27,569
it is two stage devices, took the detonator
separately,

265
00:34:27,766 --> 00:34:29,721
without both, single a dead weight.

266
00:34:30,044 --> 00:34:32,292
- What type of detonator?
- Mechanical,

267
00:34:32,461 --> 00:34:36,328
placed within the device and it
activates with a key, which we do not have.

268
00:34:37,362 --> 00:34:39,081
You can believe this guy?

269
00:34:39,995 --> 00:34:44,581
it is look like this, and should be
in the machine.

270
00:34:44,779 --> 00:34:47,017
and if we can not find it?

271
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:49,270
Then the misson will fail

272
00:34:49,453 --> 00:34:53,233
and every man, woman and child of this
planet will die.

273
00:34:56,612 --> 00:34:59,404
Why we are throwing it into big fucking hole?

274
00:35:03,534 --> 00:35:06,076
it is survived earthquakes,
pressure changes

275
00:35:06,292 --> 00:35:08,228
the tectonic changes of boards.

276
00:35:10,247 --> 00:35:12,843
Because... Barrier,

277
00:35:13,072 --> 00:35:15,631
one of us must place the bomb inside the
machine.

278
00:35:15,812 --> 00:35:17,473
- The liberator?
- Yes.

279
00:35:18,111 --> 00:35:20,527
Who will make this?

280
00:35:21,126 --> 00:35:22,779
I did.

281
00:35:25,692 --> 00:35:30,422
That are a very handly book, but our
adventure will entail some deaths in the slope.

282
00:35:30,661 --> 00:35:34,260
Chronichal... offers some suggestion on
the matter to us?

283
00:35:35,699 --> 00:35:37,562
I can.

284
00:35:43,665 --> 00:35:46,071
it was captured by the Bauhaus corporation

285
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:52,652
do not approach.

286
00:36:03,028 --> 00:36:04,759
As you can see,

287
00:36:05,005 --> 00:36:07,102
the individual bullets are largely useless.

288
00:36:09,021 --> 00:36:10,909
The mutants do not feel the pain.

289
00:36:15,209 --> 00:36:16,842
nor shock.

290
00:36:17,337 --> 00:36:19,210
How can be moved on?

291
00:36:19,499 --> 00:36:22,249
the chains avoids that much can be
moved,

292
00:36:22,525 --> 00:36:26,417
can cut with his arms.

293
00:36:26,709 --> 00:36:27,995
and how you captured it?

294
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:31,072
Our scientists requested a subject for test

295
00:36:31,284 --> 00:36:33,814
Then we went to look for them its nest.

296
00:36:34,601 --> 00:36:38,518
the deads was useless, demolished like a
papers to us...

297
00:36:38,766 --> 00:36:40,961
finally we found to a this low tank.

298
00:36:41,296 --> 00:36:43,866
- How many man did you loose?
- I did not count them.

299
00:36:44,073 --> 00:36:45,965
What is the fastest channel to kill it?

300
00:36:46,173 --> 00:36:48,049
With a fort damage to the weave.

301
00:36:48,246 --> 00:36:51,134
The automatic weapons is most
efficient,

302
00:36:53,614 --> 00:36:55,126
and that there is of launch rockets?

303
00:36:55,317 --> 00:36:57,575
Is better, of course.

304
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,912
And... the swords.

305
00:37:51,848 --> 00:37:53,748
Somebody alive in there

306
00:38:07,714 --> 00:38:11,017
- ...it will not make the sacrament?
- I am not hungry.

307
00:38:12,855 --> 00:38:15,264
- That man.
- He died.

308
00:38:15,489 --> 00:38:16,901
he said anything?

309
00:38:17,134 --> 00:38:18,971
yes forgiveness

310
00:38:19,373 --> 00:38:23,245
You think inside of his...

311
00:38:23,837 --> 00:38:25,482
I do not know.

312
00:38:26,697 --> 00:38:29,512
we can only for God mercy

313
00:38:31,497 --> 00:38:33,523
I do not think like that.

314
00:38:35,678 --> 00:38:37,270
- Brother Samuel?
- Captain.

315
00:38:37,543 --> 00:38:40,193
This is the list of supplies...

316
00:38:41,624 --> 00:38:43,748
we need them as soon as possible.

317
00:38:43,975 --> 00:38:47,209
- This is the house of God
- We are going to die, doing this work.

318
00:38:50,729 --> 00:38:53,195
for the onething, we do not have
alcohol here.

319
00:38:53,409 --> 00:38:55,780
tell me God do not drink?

320
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,405
that is for the comunion.

321
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:01,427
This is comunion.

322
00:39:14,437 --> 00:39:18,121
Severian... guardian of chronicles,

323
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,795
prepared to get dressed for the
battle.

324
00:39:21,062 --> 00:39:25,626
In silence... she cannot voice the pain
that she feels,

325
00:39:25,966 --> 00:39:29,477
for leaving home that she has known.

326
00:40:17,961 --> 00:40:22,252
Now, I must succeed or the man will
fail.

327
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:30,256
God help me, God help us all. Amen.

328
00:40:52,794 --> 00:40:54,767
it is time.

329
00:41:03,668 --> 00:41:05,465
Juba Kim Wu

330
00:41:07,319 --> 00:41:09,273
Maxilillian Von Steiner

331
00:41:11,555 --> 00:41:14,403
Valerie Duval

332
00:41:25,307 --> 00:41:27,500
John McGuire

333
00:41:33,113 --> 00:41:35,842

I have done it sometimes in the war.

338
00:43:13,153 --> 00:43:18,092
- You fought with the 103 in Africa?
- That is right

339
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,549
I was in the other side. The Imperial
lines.

340
00:43:21,775 --> 00:43:23,404
I know.

341
00:43:25,035 --> 00:43:26,173

- Your are the shark?
- The death is the shark.

348
00:45:08,209 --> 00:45:10,530
I am just a guy with a gun.

349
00:45:12,739 --> 00:45:16,638
multiple Contacts in 014 and 015.

350
00:45:21,848 --> 00:45:23,756
transporters.. get out of here.

351
00:45:26,458 --> 00:45:28,651
there goes all the money.

352
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:30,816
seems that we are going in
the opposite shuttle

353
00:45:31,026 --> 00:45:33,093
you were born in opposite shuttle.

354
00:45:46,898 --> 00:45:48,247
So, who got them?

355
00:45:48,549 --> 00:45:49,959
What?

356
00:45:50,181 --> 00:45:51,348
your tickets.

357
00:45:51,531 --> 00:45:52,792
What you want to know?

358
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:58,786
suicidal Mission? we are supposed
die together. That is an intimate thing.

359
00:45:58,989 --> 00:46:00,940
you say It as if we went to fuck.

360
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:04,202
You can fuck a lot people, you only
die once.

361
00:46:04,706 --> 00:46:06,370
Fucked up!

362
00:46:06,657 --> 00:46:07,905
What about you?

363
00:46:08,244 --> 00:46:09,679
What about me?

364
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:11,596
Your tickets?

365
00:46:15,110 --> 00:46:17,218
Stand behind the line.

366
00:46:17,856 --> 00:46:19,449
Just looking

367
00:46:19,936 --> 00:46:25,766
It looks at what you want. But they do not
pass the line or we will have some problems.

368
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:32,411
So, where we are?

369
00:46:38,299 --> 00:46:42,249
Already nothing are of anybody, it does
not matter to where you go.

370
00:46:42,486 --> 00:46:45,231
After we land, you will go away to Mars
or something?

371
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:47,946
I am with you.

372
00:46:48,968 --> 00:46:50,930
Then, you are as fuck as we.

373
00:46:51,147 --> 00:46:54,670
All this happen through something,
although you do not know it.

374
00:46:55,381 --> 00:46:59,837
Where are God? It is as one of those
things out there.

375
00:47:00,044 --> 00:47:02,087
Just another demon.

376
00:47:02,811 --> 00:47:04,053
How you got yours?

377
00:47:04,233 --> 00:47:06,243
- I have 2 children.
- You look a little young.

378
00:47:06,430 --> 00:47:08,631
- I started young.
- What are their names?

379
00:47:08,970 --> 00:47:12,080
Jack 7, Constance is 5.

380
00:47:13,042 --> 00:47:17,149
getting in the ship thinking that they
went of stroll, were very contentments.

381
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:20,247
and that were everything.

382
00:47:22,271 --> 00:47:25,628
that is a girl, I do not know her name.

383
00:47:26,143 --> 00:47:28,335

384
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:32,911
was a pure beauty,
has the precious eyes...

385
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,744
you gave your ticket a woman who
you did not even fuck her?

386
00:47:35,964 --> 00:47:37,580
I said I did not know her name...

387
00:47:37,789 --> 00:47:40,336
So you fucked her then?

388
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:48,274
Another contact to 343, closing.

389
00:47:50,068 --> 00:47:53,423
step backwards

390
00:47:57,006 --> 00:48:00,386

00:48:15,232 --> 00:48:17,641
Dive in 15 thousand feet.

394
00:48:30,317 --> 00:48:31,898
Change the direction.

395
00:48:32,189 --> 00:48:34,001
They are going to get close.

396
00:48:35,481 --> 00:48:37,690
- It goes to the station.
- It is a civiliation ship.

397
00:48:37,898 --> 00:48:39,852
Take the station, soldier.

398
00:48:40,457 --> 00:48:42,772
somebody tells me what is going on

399
00:48:53,448 --> 00:48:55,406
Fire.

400
00:49:16,731 --> 00:49:18,130
Fire.

401
00:49:34,483 --> 00:49:36,217
Captain, I lost him.

402
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:01,764
All into the capsule. Let's go... Let's go..

00:50:23,968 --> 00:50:25,333
Get out here!

407
00:50:29,243 --> 00:50:30,521
Why do not go off?

408
00:50:30,756 --> 00:50:32,308
does not work.

409
00:50:32,669 --> 00:50:35,461
- What are you doing?
- I will make it work.

410
00:50:35,671 --> 00:50:37,470

411
00:50:54,184 --> 00:50:55,634
where is the parachute.

412
00:51:03,746 --> 00:51:05,168
What's going on?

413
00:51:05,715 --> 00:51:07,217
we are still falling.

414
00:51:07,444 --> 00:51:09,498
- What happens?
- We lost the parachute.

415
00:51:13,668 --> 00:51:16,428

418
00:51:21,718 --> 00:51:25,372
We have to open it when we are arriving,
before hitting.

419
00:51:25,817 --> 00:51:27,405
- He is right. - What you say?
- I do not have idea

420
00:51:31,449 --> 00:51:33,096

00:51:34,431 --> 00:51:36,241
Come on to hit.

Thank you!

435
00:53:46,506 --> 00:53:47,409
Good luck, Sergeant.

436
00:54:04,464 --> 00:54:07,438
- It is necessary to go fast.

437
00:54:07,965 --> 00:54:10,301
But it is certain that they not to be

00:54:13,427 --> 00:54:14,519
...of the north to the southwest.

440
00:54:14,671 --> 00:54:16,252
To go directly for the city, as it said
the ancient one.

441
00:54:16,593 --> 00:54:17,195
Let's go.

442
00:54:52,970 --> 00:54:53,649
Check the targets.

443
00:54:55,305 --> 00:54:55,834

00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:49,597
Oh, Jesus.

447

where are the hell they are going?

448
00:55:56,121 --> 00:55:56,799
Hunter!

449
00:56:14,194 --> 00:56:15,096
It starts.

450
00:56:15,324 --> 00:56:18,940
It starts with 2 of gold and diamond clocks

453
00:56:37,138 --> 00:56:37,970
We are together,

454
00:56:38,348 --> 00:56:42,792
and to show our gratitude, we needed to
see a good amount of marks.

455
00:56:42,950 --> 00:56:44,607
He is reach to buy another one
ticket.

456
00:56:45,173 --> 00:56:46,755
But... all my money.

457
00:56:47,658 --> 00:56:48,752
Then fuck off

458
00:56:51,764 --> 00:56:53,235
Do you know who I am?

459
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:00,165
That is you are.

460
00:57:02,501 --> 00:57:05,627
He frees his cash, nobody goes
free

461
00:57:08,189 --> 00:57:09,056
We need to get there.

462
00:57:10,941 --> 00:57:11,996
it is a good place for an ambush.

463
00:57:12,527 --> 00:57:13,468
I cannot have many mutants,

464
00:57:13,995 --> 00:57:14,975
it is too much easy to meet.

465
00:57:16,295 --> 00:57:17,690
All the others come.

468
00:57:25,075 --> 00:57:26,282
It gives this to me. Oh, fuck.

469
00:57:26,663 --> 00:57:27,719
It leaves to pass, hunter.

470
00:57:31,106 --> 00:57:32,011
We go this corner then.

471
00:57:32,914 --> 00:57:34,986
- Come on, we do not have time for this.
- Beam time.

472
00:57:40,541 --> 00:57:42,202
In agreement, 5.

473
00:57:44,189 --> 00:57:47,351
Come on, show your money, come on.

474
00:57:58,005 --> 00:57:58,875
Get out of here.

475
00:58:02,939 --> 00:58:03,693
Leave them now.

476
00:58:04,259 --> 00:58:05,049
you are making a bet?

477
00:58:06,030 --> 00:58:10,999
First let pass kids and
women and later men if there is still space.

478
00:58:11,189 --> 00:58:12,168
Hey soldier boy

479
00:58:14,732 --> 00:58:15,672
Yeah?

480
00:58:16,841 --> 00:58:17,557
What do you want?

481
00:58:18,798 --> 00:58:19,364
2.75

482
00:58:19,517 --> 00:58:20,381

485
00:58:38,461 --> 00:58:39,139
What do you wait?

486
00:58:39,366 --> 00:58:40,308
A little.

487
00:58:42,003 --> 00:58:43,321
Load the suitcases, take them all.

488
00:58:58,216 --> 00:58:58,745
Stop.

489
00:58:59,874 --> 00:59:00,552
Church...

490
00:59:01,494 --> 00:59:02,435
is not very far.

491
00:59:02,776 --> 00:59:04,358
middle of the old city.

492
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:07,935
- They already know towards where we go?
- Straight on.

493
00:59:10,194 --> 00:59:12,641
Listen, threatening the mission of new,
and I take off me.

494
00:59:12,907 --> 00:59:13,735
Wait

495
01:00:19,819 --> 01:00:20,460
Christ.

496
01:00:23,811 --> 01:00:25,053
What kind of Church is this?

497
01:00:26,372 --> 01:00:27,503
How they loose the city?

498
01:00:38,724 --> 01:00:40,457
We gonna go down to the lost city.

499
01:00:50,399 --> 01:00:51,453
They must be thousands.

500
01:00:52,319 --> 01:00:54,806
Each new age receive the bones of the
other.

501
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:57,555
How many times they come before?

502
01:00:59,323 --> 01:01:00,192
They did not do this.

503
01:01:02,112 --> 01:01:03,205
We did this.

504
01:01:05,012 --> 01:01:07,421
Always we kill another

505
01:01:09,384 --> 01:01:13,491
Challenger is our supremacy architecture
of our proper ones.

506
01:01:32,128 --> 01:01:33,107
- Brother.
- Yes.

507
01:01:43,571 --> 01:01:44,475
This is crappy.

508
01:01:45,193 --> 01:01:46,361
We need to go down deep in this.

509
01:01:47,679 --> 01:01:49,676
Oh, the city of ancients.

510
01:01:50,429 --> 01:01:52,690
Throughout more than 500 years back, in the
black winter.

511
01:01:57,210 --> 01:01:58,228
Holly Shit!

512
01:01:58,535 --> 01:01:59,251
is watching...

513
01:02:44,987 --> 01:02:45,815
Where are they?

514
01:02:47,888 --> 01:02:48,716
I have no idea.

515
01:03:00,580 --> 01:03:01,257
What it says?

516
01:03:02,425 --> 01:03:03,442
Abandon all hope?

517
01:03:05,099 --> 01:03:06,041
Mother fuckers!

518
01:03:08,828 --> 01:03:09,506
No shit.

519
01:03:20,428 --> 01:03:21,369
Jesus, that's deep.

520
01:03:22,123 --> 01:03:23,554
Someone can stay here.

521
01:03:24,156 --> 01:03:25,323
we are not going to lower thus.

522
01:03:27,209 --> 01:03:27,888
I got it.

523
01:03:29,056 --> 01:03:30,374
You watch your ass you are there.

524
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:34,102
not safe

525
01:03:35,309 --> 01:03:36,741
That has to happen sooner or later.

526
01:03:39,978 --> 01:03:41,260
Take care yourself Juba.

527
01:03:43,142 --> 01:03:43,934
Prepare these toys,

528
01:03:44,649 --> 01:03:46,420
we go first and we leave others them
follow the way.

529
01:03:48,114 --> 01:03:48,868
Hey what you say?

530
01:03:53,841 --> 01:03:54,443
Brother?

531
01:03:56,516 --> 01:03:57,231
This is brake.

532
01:03:58,136 --> 01:03:59,794
If very fast it loose, you fall, in
agreement?

533
01:04:01,225 --> 01:04:01,977
Lift it up

534
01:04:03,070 --> 01:04:04,727
put youselves down.

535
01:04:05,179 --> 01:04:06,348
Once you do it, hold.

536
01:04:10,226 --> 01:04:10,866
That is it

537
01:04:11,845 --> 01:04:12,637
Take it easy.

538
01:04:13,094 --> 01:04:15,052
- And this?
- That is a fast exit, I do not touch it.

539
01:04:19,532 --> 01:04:20,136
Alright?

540
01:04:22,357 --> 01:04:23,148
Let's go.

541
01:04:33,918 --> 01:04:34,785
take care...

542
01:04:37,302 --> 01:04:38,433
Fucking deep is this, ha?

543
01:04:47,845 --> 01:04:49,465
- Nice... getting hot down here.
- 40.

544
01:04:59,894 --> 01:05:01,175
- Tell me.
- 55.

545
01:05:01,627 --> 01:05:02,381
How far?

546
01:05:03,926 --> 01:05:05,431
- Stop!!
- 60.

547
01:05:08,632 --> 01:05:10,482
- we cannot continue.
- It is very far.

548
01:05:12,478 --> 01:05:13,119
It is dark.

549
01:05:14,099 --> 01:05:14,814
Yeah, it is dark.

550
01:05:15,566 --> 01:05:16,322
Something is not right.

551
01:05:24,566 --> 01:05:25,207
It cannot be.

552
01:05:25,473 --> 01:05:27,318
- What says in the damn book?
- What I lost?

553
01:05:33,569 --> 01:05:34,434
We are people come down

554
01:05:38,804 --> 01:05:41,214
go back, a long way.

555
01:05:42,645 --> 01:05:44,114
Yes, always for help.

556
01:06:26,246 --> 01:06:27,791
Sound that it is here.

557
01:06:30,427 --> 01:06:35,059
It must be here. 55 or 64 floors below,
must have an exit. The access is right here.

558
01:06:52,758 --> 01:06:54,565
- do not let me fall.
- First died!

559
01:07:08,612 --> 01:07:09,931
You are a lucky son of a bitch.

560
01:07:10,797 --> 01:07:12,040
God provided, Sergeant.

561
01:07:20,287 --> 01:07:21,004
God provides.

562
01:07:36,103 --> 01:07:36,706
Hold on!

563
01:07:36,934 --> 01:07:37,499
Hold on!

564
01:07:41,530 --> 01:07:42,173
Very ugly.

565
01:07:48,463 --> 01:07:49,632
Here, use this.

566
01:07:52,085 --> 01:07:52,726
Granade.

567
01:08:03,569 --> 01:08:05,000
- Grenade.
- Grenade.

568
01:08:07,449 --> 01:08:08,730
What happened.

569
01:09:59,556 --> 01:10:00,460
Any last words?

570
01:10:00,649 --> 01:10:01,592
shut up mother fucker!

571
01:10:24,076 --> 01:10:24,720
Are you well?

572
01:10:30,596 --> 01:10:31,575
Noo...

573
01:10:39,709 --> 01:10:40,350
Down.

574
01:10:55,538 --> 01:10:56,367
Anybody hurt?

575
01:11:07,590 --> 01:11:08,194
Hey.

576
01:11:09,442 --> 01:11:10,196
Shit.

577
01:11:17,315 --> 01:11:17,956
Let's go.

578
01:11:18,941 --> 01:11:19,659
Let's go.

579
01:11:29,528 --> 01:11:30,282
Dead end.

580
01:11:30,547 --> 01:11:31,791
Anybody take the cards?

581
01:11:32,542 --> 01:11:33,070
McGwire.

582
01:11:33,939 --> 01:11:34,691
figures

583
01:11:42,527 --> 01:11:43,243
Thanks.

584
01:12:03,275 --> 01:12:05,836
They use tunnels take the bodies
towards the machine.

585
01:12:06,704 --> 01:12:08,398
Takes days,weeks even.

586
01:12:09,227 --> 01:12:10,395
You faith in that book.

587
01:12:12,969 --> 01:12:16,170
- You're wasting your time.
- We have many stones that to clear.

588
01:12:16,737 --> 01:12:19,411
- Fucking more than half.
- You found an inspiration?

589
01:12:19,826 --> 01:12:24,042
Much in the book, Sergeant, but in
the end, even this book is... just a book.

590
01:12:26,078 --> 01:12:26,605
Good one.

591
01:12:27,363 --> 01:12:29,170
I take my faith from something superior.

592
01:12:30,324 --> 01:12:32,960
Well I have not seen much reason
why we have faith.

593
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:35,182
You have seen the worse thing than a man
can do.

594
01:12:37,518 --> 01:12:39,556
But you have not seen what is the worse
thing than the enemy can do.

595
01:12:42,349 --> 01:12:43,063
So...

596
01:12:43,292 --> 01:12:45,287
- Who got your tickets?
- What?

597
01:12:46,231 --> 01:12:46,910
Your tickets.

598
01:12:47,511 --> 01:12:48,342
It doesn't matter.

599
01:12:49,398 --> 01:12:50,415
It matters to me.

600
01:12:58,625 --> 01:12:59,379
Who cares!

601
01:13:01,036 --> 01:13:01,828
I'm sorry...

602
01:13:04,614 --> 01:13:07,100
Everything comes from God.

603
01:13:08,369 --> 01:13:10,179
Everything is from God.

604
01:13:12,554 --> 01:13:14,248
Came from outside.

605
01:13:19,748 --> 01:13:20,690
It is the end.

606
01:13:21,820 --> 01:13:24,647
everything and everywhere in all
sides.

607
01:13:25,361 --> 01:13:26,492
and for all the time.

608
01:13:28,490 --> 01:13:29,582
and so I have faith...

609
01:13:30,824 --> 01:13:32,071
...over which we will prevail.

610
01:13:34,218 --> 01:13:37,042
Because the other alternative is too
terrible to even think it.

611
01:13:38,211 --> 01:13:39,304
and if I do not believe in God?

612
01:13:40,171 --> 01:13:42,655
If you did not believe in God you would
not be here.

613
01:13:45,822 --> 01:13:46,539
Hey.

614
01:13:46,728 --> 01:13:47,595
You are going to help?

615
01:13:47,936 --> 01:13:50,495
Maybe you have not noticed it, but the
mission gonna be fucked.

616
01:13:56,332 --> 01:13:57,466
You should have a little faith.

617
01:14:11,496 --> 01:14:12,512
Give me the hand.

618
01:14:22,002 --> 01:14:22,833
something there.. down...

619
01:14:38,071 --> 01:14:38,711
Hold on!

620
01:14:44,325 --> 01:14:45,007
Bastards!

621
01:14:45,614 --> 01:14:46,969
Must there have been a few weeks.

622
01:14:52,547 --> 01:14:53,565
We must persist.

623
01:14:56,681 --> 01:14:57,736
What demons take in?

624
01:15:00,071 --> 01:15:00,674
Hunter!

625
01:15:01,277 --> 01:15:01,992
What is he doing?

626
01:15:05,116 --> 01:15:06,660
- Sergeant.
- Jesus.

627
01:15:06,813 --> 01:15:08,057
- Hunter.
- What happens?

628
01:15:08,209 --> 01:15:08,963
He is Nathan.

629
01:15:11,223 --> 01:15:11,863
Fuck.

630
01:15:13,070 --> 01:15:13,823
Come on, let's go.

631
01:15:15,444 --> 01:15:16,648
it is just one man

632
01:15:16,988 --> 01:15:17,892
I know that man.

633
01:15:21,094 --> 01:15:22,524
We have a mission.

634
01:15:36,620 --> 01:15:37,524
Good bye!

635
01:15:44,545 --> 01:15:45,412
Let's go!

636
01:16:42,048 --> 01:16:43,367
- Nate.
- Mitch.

637
01:16:45,289 --> 01:16:47,961
- Thanks heaven that you are here.
- Do not talk.

638
01:16:48,340 --> 01:16:49,697
Come on to leave here, we go.

639
01:16:53,050 --> 01:16:54,709
- Where are the guards?
- You are safe.

640
01:16:54,898 --> 01:16:56,293
We have to go now.

641
01:17:06,859 --> 01:17:08,291
Almost there. Keep going

642
01:17:14,959 --> 01:17:15,599
What is that?

643
01:17:37,324 --> 01:17:38,869
Mitch, what are you doing?

644
01:17:39,761 --> 01:17:41,569
I gonna find another way to leave here.

645
01:17:46,014 --> 01:17:47,220
I am going to make a bell crank.

646
01:17:48,688 --> 01:17:50,045
We have to leave this hole.

647
01:17:56,375 --> 01:17:59,050
- Mars, eh?
- Yes, Mars.

648
01:18:00,105 --> 01:18:02,220
- How you explain that?
- There is a deal with a guy.

649
01:18:02,785 --> 01:18:03,353
And?

650
01:18:05,388 --> 01:18:08,213
Yes,you know. To save to the
world and that.

651
01:18:11,263 --> 01:18:12,015
How is going?

652
01:18:15,669 --> 01:18:16,573
Hey... hey... hey...

653
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:20,603
Jesus.

654
01:18:23,917 --> 01:18:24,708
Dissmis me

655
01:18:27,497 --> 01:18:28,363
Finish the mission.

656
01:18:32,169 --> 01:18:34,955
- I cannot leave you here.
- I am not asking you.

657
01:18:48,886 --> 01:18:51,863
Tell Adelade and Gracy...

658
01:18:57,172 --> 01:18:59,280
...tell them... tell them...

659
01:19:01,917 --> 01:19:02,671
...tell them...

660
01:19:51,447 --> 01:19:52,915
The bag, we cannot lose the bomb.

661
01:19:57,508 --> 01:19:58,150
Take it!

662
01:19:58,414 --> 01:19:59,018
Take it!

663
01:20:01,277 --> 01:20:01,956
Give me your hand.

664
01:20:17,848 --> 01:20:18,714
- We must go on.
- Yes.

665
01:20:27,602 --> 01:20:29,636
- We have to go on.
- But he is still human.

666
01:20:30,013 --> 01:20:30,692
Samuel!

667
01:20:40,292 --> 01:20:41,276
- Thank you.
- It is an honor.

668
01:20:52,648 --> 01:20:53,595
We go there.

669
01:21:27,674 --> 01:21:28,691
Oh, come on. Give me a sign.

670
01:21:33,605 --> 01:21:34,961
Die bastards!

671
01:21:38,351 --> 01:21:39,029
Nooo...

672
01:22:42,113 --> 01:22:43,204
Holly Jesus.

673
01:22:43,846 --> 01:22:44,522
Hunter!

674
01:22:50,586 --> 01:22:51,716
When the last time you spoke?

675
01:22:52,509 --> 01:22:53,186
I cannot remember it.

676
01:22:56,275 --> 01:22:57,180
I could not save them.

677
01:22:59,099 --> 01:23:01,402
They tooks them move to the Machine.

678
01:23:11,194 --> 01:23:11,759
What are you doing?

679
01:23:12,216 --> 01:23:13,495
Everything what we need are in the damn
book.

680
01:23:14,099 --> 01:23:15,004
it is not permitted

681
01:23:18,733 --> 01:23:19,638
took everything to it.

682
01:23:19,976 --> 01:23:21,371
We have to continue looking for between
these things.

683
01:23:22,465 --> 01:23:23,141
What it says?

684
01:23:24,010 --> 01:23:25,027
- I do not know it.
- Read it.

685
01:23:25,715 --> 01:23:26,807
I cannot.

686
01:23:29,254 --> 01:23:29,861
Look!

687
01:23:30,394 --> 01:23:30,921
Read.

688
01:23:32,465 --> 01:23:33,521
I cannot read!

689
01:23:37,213 --> 01:23:39,925
How you can believe in a book that not
even you can read?

690
01:23:40,415 --> 01:23:44,222
I do not need to read it, I do not need
to read it to think that it is truth.

691
01:23:48,141 --> 01:23:50,926
- That is the nature of the faith.
- Fantastic!

692
01:23:52,696 --> 01:23:53,526
What do you believe in?

693
01:23:58,686 --> 01:24:01,961
I do not believe, I know it
everything.

694
01:24:03,544 --> 01:24:04,186
Come on?

695
01:25:28,341 --> 01:25:30,412
Shit! comes with one.

696
01:25:56,471 --> 01:25:57,225
He still alive.

697
01:26:23,476 --> 01:26:24,343

698
01:26:25,208 --> 01:26:26,301
only has mine

699
01:26:30,368 --> 01:26:31,046
What about the rope?

700
01:26:38,766 --> 01:26:39,482
stay then.

701
01:27:25,232 --> 01:27:25,948
Damn it!

702
01:27:29,187 --> 01:27:32,313
- they are coming.
- Tunnels are not going to hold.

703
01:27:43,381 --> 01:27:47,225
- This rope is not going to hold them much more.
- Then we gonna faster.

704
01:27:58,935 --> 01:27:59,537
Steiner?

705
01:28:00,521 --> 01:28:01,424
Steiner?

706
01:29:54,413 --> 01:29:55,016
Jesus!

707
01:29:55,769 --> 01:29:56,333
No!

708
01:30:45,219 --> 01:30:45,785
Hunter?

709
01:31:05,896 --> 01:31:06,686
Are you one of them?

710
01:31:07,705 --> 01:31:09,215
Just picked up of my face.

711
01:31:09,706 --> 01:31:10,573
Are you?

712
01:31:11,250 --> 01:31:12,041
What you create?

713
01:31:12,272 --> 01:31:13,025
Give me that bomb

714
01:31:16,377 --> 01:31:17,470
Give me that fucking bomb

715
01:31:25,867 --> 01:31:27,188
come mother fuckers.

716
01:32:12,604 --> 01:32:13,356
there is no time...

717
01:32:25,293 --> 01:32:26,575
place the detonator in the hole.

718
01:32:27,029 --> 01:32:27,857
You have to put in hole.

719
01:32:28,234 --> 01:32:29,664
- Put in the hole!
- Which hole?

720
01:32:30,305 --> 01:32:31,023
any hole

721
01:32:34,562 --> 01:32:35,165
this one?

722
01:32:39,044 --> 01:32:39,760
It is Shit.

723
01:32:40,325 --> 01:32:40,966
Does not fit.

724
01:33:04,615 --> 01:33:05,782
- It is not working.
- What?

725
01:33:10,114 --> 01:33:10,716
Give me the pages.

726
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:11,847
Come on.

727
01:33:13,091 --> 01:33:14,709
- What are you doing?
- I am working on.

728
01:33:20,321 --> 01:33:20,961
I lost my sword.

729
01:33:23,523 --> 01:33:24,087
Here.

730
01:33:49,164 --> 01:33:49,803
Samuel?

731
01:33:50,972 --> 01:33:52,027
Ritchell

732
01:33:57,223 --> 01:34:00,123
No, that is not Samuel.

733
01:34:22,805 --> 01:34:23,934
Come on, no.

734
01:34:29,321 --> 01:34:30,075
Kill him.

735
01:34:35,273 --> 01:34:35,841
Kill him.

736
01:34:36,556 --> 01:34:37,121
Kill him.

737
01:34:48,982 --> 01:34:51,205
Ssshhh... You are Samuel. It is allright.

738
01:36:03,442 --> 01:36:04,158
That's for Nathan.

739
01:36:05,251 --> 01:36:06,269
This for the Jesus.

740
01:36:09,357 --> 01:36:10,374
and this is for Samuel

741
01:36:45,475 --> 01:36:46,192
Come...

742
01:36:49,171 --> 01:36:49,811
Come...

743
01:36:53,643 --> 01:36:54,584
Have faith.

744
01:38:38,238 --> 01:38:39,182
and so ended.

745
01:38:40,084 --> 01:38:40,800
I feel...

746
01:38:41,820 --> 01:38:43,513
.. it did not...

747
01:38:44,268 --> 01:38:46,414
incredible unbeliever...

748
01:38:47,695 --> 01:38:48,446
...save them

749
01:39:07,416 --> 01:39:08,169
Christ.
