1
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,160
Charles, isn't this great?

2
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,280
Yeah.

3
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,880
Good afternoon.

4
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,160
Hi.

5
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,680
Man, what wouldn't I do
to get my hands on her?

6
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,720
Get your hands on who?

7
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,040
The Challenger-
$20-million airplane.

8
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,480
What did you think I meant?

9
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,200
- Come along, Charles.
- Charles, you coming?

10
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,960
- Yeah.
- I'm supposed to give you this.

11
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,040
- OK.
- Charles Morse the billionaire?

12
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,720
My God, is that who you are?

13
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,800
Yeah.

14
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,400
Stuff everything
into the back.

15
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,800
I've taken the liberty
of talking to the pilot.

16
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,480
I've checked the engine log.
The plane's in good shape.

17
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,800
Good avionics.
The fella's been around.

18
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,680
Try not to fly
under any low ceiling,

19
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,680
any possibility
of bird-strike, or ice.

20
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,520
- What's bird-strike?
- Flocks of migrating birds.

21
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,440
- Lf we hit them, we're all dead.
- Absolutely.

22
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,840
Especially this time of year.

23
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,720
Any questions, I'll have a
chopper here and fly you out.

24
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,800
We'll be fine.

25
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,880
- I said you'd have a good time.
- Yeah.

26
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,440
When will you require
your plane?

27
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,600
- Bob?
- They want the film in 34 hours.

28
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,960
I'd say 8:00 tomorrow night.

29
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,680
- Eight o'clock tomorrow night.
- Yes, sir.

30
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,960
Thank you.

31
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,720
Oh, no!

32
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,480
You can't handle
this northern weather?

33
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,560
- I'll be all right.
- It's your own fault.

34
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,080
Hey, is that a new watch?

35
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,720
Yeah. Dual time zone.
Tells the time in two places.

36
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,280
What for?

37
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,680
If I want to know
the time in New York,

38
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,120
I don't have to add three.

39
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,120
Look there.

40
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,840
Right there.

41
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,440
So you built this place
with your own hands?

42
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,840
Yes, ma'am.
Been building it all my life.

43
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,600
OK, right this way, folks.

44
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,920
You don't have to worry about
keys 'cause we got no locks.

45
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,280
Kitchen is always open.
You can fix whatever you like.

46
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,960
The bedrooms and outhouses
are upstairs.

47
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
We want you to relax,
kick off your shoes,

48
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,280
and just get
down-home comfortable.

49
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,680
- Hey, Stephen.
- Yeah?

50
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,120
This is what I'm talking about.

51
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,560
See? That's what I want
for tomorrow:

52
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,040
An unsentimental photograph.

53
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,200
To get a truly
unselfconscious photograph,

54
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,080
you almost have to go
back to the 19th century.

55
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,320
How old is that?

56
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,000
Took it last fall. That's
Jack Hawk, a friend of mine.

57
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,000
You took the photo?

58
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,240
I took the photo.
He took the bear.

59
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,400
I'd be out hunting with him
right now if you weren't here...

60
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,680
and I had my rifle sighted in.

61
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,440
You interested in books?

62
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,560
Yeah. Why can't you get
your rifle sighted in?

63
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,880
What?

64
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,280
Why can't you get
your rifle sighted in?

65
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,080
Need to rig up a bench rest.

66
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,360
An ironing board
makes a good bench rest.

67
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,800
No disrespect... I'm surprised
you know what a bench rest is.

68
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,520
Charles knows
what everything is.

69
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,760
Got a question, ask him.
Charles knows everything.

70
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,040
Take a mighty accomplished man
to claim that.

71
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,840
I don't claim anything.

72
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,760
Ask him.
See if I'm wrong.

73
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,160
- Bet you can't stump him.
- Bet you I can.

74
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,400
Tell you what...

75
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,760
I will give you $5. 00...

76
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,880
if you can tell me what's
on the other side of this blade.

77
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,840
It's a rabbit smoking a pipe.

78
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,040
Hmm.

79
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,280
A rabbit smoking a pipe.
Well, well, well.

80
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,840
Why in the world would that be?

81
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,640
Uh, it's a symbol
of the Cree Indians.

82
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,040
On one side there's the panther,

83
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,040
on the other, his prey,
the rabbit.

84
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:59,200
He sits unafraid.
He smokes his pipe.

85
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,240
It's a traditional motif.

86
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,120
Why is he unafraid?

87
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,520
Because he's smarter
than the panther.

88
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,400
Ha! Sir... you impress me.

89
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,880
Oh. Thank you.

90
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,840
Amazing accomplishment.

91
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,040
No, it's not an accomplishment.
It's a freak.

92
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,360
Is that so?

93
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,200
Yeah.

94
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,080
I seem to retain
all these facts,

95
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,040
but putting them to any useful
purpose is another matter.

96
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,200
Hmm.

97
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,000
Oh, hey, listen up, folks.

98
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,840
We got a problem
with bears around here.

99
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:42,480
Never leave food uncovered,
even in the lodge.

100
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,520
Never.

101
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:48,520
You see a bear near you,
stand still.

102
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,400
Let him know that you know
that he sees you.

103
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:59,120
And back up, hmm? Real slow.

104
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,920
Anybody's in trouble,
get my attention.

105
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,640
I'll be on it
like a duck on a June bug.

106
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,120
Now, make yourselves
comfortable.

107
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,720
I think I'm going to bed.

108
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,760
Shut up!

109
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,160
Lord, I'm bushed.

110
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,840
New book?

111
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,080
Yes. It's about surviving
in the wilderness.

112
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,680
You're always reading something.

113
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,520
Yeah. My secretary gave it
to me. Do you know why?

114
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,680
Huh?

115
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,600
You know why
she gave me the book?

116
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:55,840
That guy gave me the creeps with
all that talk about the bear.

117
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,640
Why she gave you the book?

118
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,320
Because you're
the salt of the earth.

119
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,240
Oh, is that so?

120
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,480
You're the most excellent man.
That's why I married you.

121
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,480
And you're the only woman
I've ever wanted.

122
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,400
Well, then...
see what a luck y guy you are?

123
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,600
Yes, I do.

124
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,680
This is
a special day for me.

125
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,400
I know it is. I'm really glad
you came away with us.

126
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,880
You should get away more often.

127
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,640
Charles.

128
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,800
Yeah?

129
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,880
Can you go downstairs
and get me a sandwich?

130
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,360
Yeah, OK. Of course.

131
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,280
Did I ever tell you
you're an angel?

132
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,000
No.

133
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,520
Everything but the wings.

134
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,840
A sandwich.

135
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,680
Aah!

136
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:14,320
Surprise!

137
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,160
Oh, my God.
Charles, are you all right?

138
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,440
Christ, Charles.
Are you all right?

139
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,720
Jesus, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

140
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,040
Are you all right?

141
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,800
- I'm fine.
- Are you all right?

142
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,520
- Uh-huh.
- You sure?

143
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,800
Happy birthday dear Charles

144
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,080
Happy birthday.

145
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,840
So you didn't forget.

146
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,560
I could never forget you.

147
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,480
I could never forget.
Come here, baby.

148
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,160
- Yes, sir! Yes, sir.
- A glass of champagne.

149
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,640
Champagne for Charles!

150
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,920
Thank you. Thank you.

151
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,880
Blow out the candle, Charles.

152
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,800
May I have your attention
for a moment, please?

153
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,120
Can I get serious for a moment?

154
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:09,840
Charles, thank you
for your good nature,

155
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,760
your intelligence,
your generosity.

156
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,200
Yeah.

157
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,000
Uh, forgive us for this charade.

158
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,480
And in short, happy birthday.

159
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:23,040
Happy birthday, Charles.
Thank you.

160
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,880
To a good companion,
a good friend, and a good sport.

161
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,440
And a very brave man.

162
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,640
Hear, hear!

163
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,760
Here.

164
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,960
Thank you. Ah.

165
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,200
Right.

166
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,720
Oh, Mickey, that's beautiful.

167
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,120
There's an engraving inside.

168
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,480
What's it say, Charles?

169
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:50,560
It says, "To my beloved husband
on his birthday...

170
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,440
'from the luckiest woman
in the world. "

171
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,520
Ohh...

172
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,560
This is a superb present.
Thank you.

173
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,720
May you wear it
in good health.

174
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,760
Here you go.
Here you go, you birthday boy.

175
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,640
Thank you.

176
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,600
Ooh...
What is it?

177
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:20,120
- Oh, look at that!
- Good knife.

178
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,240
It's beautiful.

179
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,040
Give him a coin. You got
to give the donor a coin.

180
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,960
Old superstition.

181
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,760
Ah, yes. Thank you.

182
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,440
Give him a coin?

183
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,920
If someone gives you a knife,

184
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,160
you should give them
a coin in return...

185
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,520
or it cuts the friendship.

186
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,680
Thank you, Bob.

187
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,880
Charles.

188
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,400
Getting late. Work day tomorrow.
Let's pack it in.

189
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,120
- Happy birthday, Charles.
- Happy birthday.

190
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,440
Thanks. Thank you. Good night.

191
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,920
Come on.
Happy birthday.

192
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,080
Thank you.

193
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,440
- Happy birthday to you.
- Thank you.

194
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,760
Nice looking lady. Your wife?

195
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,560
Yes. Why do you ask?

196
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,560
Just like to know
who everybody is.

197
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,440
Hold on.
It's flaring. Got it.

198
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,560
- OK... and let's go.
- Five, six.

199
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,600
All righty.

200
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,320
Beautiful.
Really beautiful. Great.

201
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,680
- Yep.
- Yeah, that's great.

202
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,320
- Oops.
- Could you lift that up?

203
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,400
- Are we on here?
- Give me the 180.

204
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,640
- For me?
- No, no, no.

205
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,200
One more. Let's go.

206
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,320
We'll do one more roll.
One more roll.

207
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,280
Officer... can I sunbathe
on this beach nude?

208
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,760
Sorry, lady,
it's against the rules.

209
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,240
But I have a divine right.

210
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,200
Your left ain't bad,
either, but rules is rules.

211
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,680
Let's go. Check it, please.

212
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:01,080
Beautiful.
Huh. Kodiak bear.

213
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,840
Soon kill you as look at you.

214
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,360
And the one's killed a man,

215
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,760
man-hunter for the rest
of his life.

216
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,920
Nothing he'd rather eat.
Got the taste of human flesh.

217
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,880
A man-killing machine.

218
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:20,000
I'm leaving today,
so let's get the shoes polished.

219
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,400
Do I need to walk you
through this whole thing?

220
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,440
- No, the shoes-
- Scrap the shoes.

221
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,400
What the-for God's sakes,
this isn't brain surgery.

222
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,120
It's a fucking pair of shoes.
Get James down here.

223
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,240
Robert, he's sick.

224
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,040
He's sick,
the shoes look like shit,

225
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,600
and everything I ask you for-

226
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,760
This is lame.
This is really fucking lame.

227
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,000
The inside of a banana peel
will shine shoes.

228
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,160
Come with me.
A fount of information.

229
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,360
Shine shoes with a banana.
You should know that.

230
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,000
He's sick, Bob. James is sick.

231
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,760
Well, how sick is he?

232
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,520
He'd have to get better to die.

233
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,720
Ha!

234
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,480
That guy.

235
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,640
That guy. He's the guy
for my photograph.

236
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,440
Excuse me. Where is this guy?
He's your friend, right?

237
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,120
Where is this guy in the photo?

238
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,600
This is the guy we want,
not some fucking model.

239
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,600
Where-where is he?

240
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:25,000
Jack Hawk?
Cabin up north, 80 miles.

241
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,880
Does he have a phone?

242
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:30,160
No phone, no radio.
He'll likely be out hunting.

243
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,880
Well, then we'll just
go and find him. Let's go.

244
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,480
Seems you can make a compass
out of a needle.

245
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,840
My God. That's a new one on me.

246
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,080
You spend much time
in the woods?

247
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,000
No, I'm afraid most of
my knowledge is theoretical.

248
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,600
Such a... perfect spot.

249
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,400
Such privilege.

250
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,760
It's a shame...
everyone can't enjoy it.

251
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,120
Yeah.

252
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,600
It is remote, and-

253
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,760
That's true. Now, you think
this spot is so remote...

254
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,400
that only the few can enjoy it,
but I got a plan.

255
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,320
I got a scheme
to develop this lake,

256
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:21,000
and I think that
you could appreciate it.

257
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,920
Now, no need, really,
for you to look at these...

258
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,320
'cause you can envision this
better than they can draw,

259
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,880
but I want you to look
at these figures.

260
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,800
Now, here's
the interesting part.

261
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:36,840
For only 30 or
40 million dollars, you can-

262
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,840
Ah.

263
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,840
I beg your pardon?

264
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,440
I thought for a moment
you were just being courteous.

265
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,800
What do you mean?

266
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,120
Nothing.

267
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,520
Come on, let's go get him.
We'll lose the light.

268
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,600
We lose the light at4:18.

269
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,640
There's the guy we should've
been shooting all along.

270
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,680
He's got some character
in his face.

271
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,040
- Charles.
- Yeah?

272
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,320
- What's the matter?
- Huh?

273
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,720
Uh... no, it's nothing.

274
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,720
He's jaded. That's what it is.

275
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,960
That's it. I'm jaded.

276
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,160
We're going on an impromptu
adventure. You come, too.

277
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,880
Charles on an adventure?

278
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,840
That's right.
What do you say, Charles?

279
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,440
We'll be back in two hours.

280
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,000
- Uh...
- Get some air under your wings.

281
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,520
All right.

282
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,920
Yeah, OK.

283
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,960
Behold the mighty hunter.
Come on.

284
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,880
Hello!

285
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,440
Aw, that's just great.

286
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:17,560
Our model's gone bear hunting.
How butch of him.

287
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,000
Where's he going?

288
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,880
Big Bass Lake, partner!

289
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,520
It's about 20 miles northwest.

290
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,360
And we're left here taking
a picture of sweet Fanny Anne.

291
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,240
- What do you say, Charles?
- Huh?

292
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,840
We, uh...

293
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,320
- Should we chance it?
- Be careful.

294
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,720
Careful of what?

295
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,200
It's a deadfall.

296
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,920
- What's a deadfall?
- It's a pitto catch bears.

297
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,360
What are we being careful of?

298
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,640
It's a bear pit.

299
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,920
What do you say? Should we
press on? Should we be bold?

300
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,440
You really need to find him?

301
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,920
I need to get that film.

302
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,960
A good plan today is better
than a perfect plan tomorrow.

303
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,360
- What do you say?
- OK, let's be bold.

304
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,120
Hey, there's the spirit
that beat the Japanese.

305
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,720
Weather coming in from
the north. Snow, maybe.

306
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,960
- Could I tell you something?
- Hmm? Yeah, if you like.

307
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,480
I admire the way you took
that joke last night.

308
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,960
Handled it well.
Embarrassing moment.

309
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,880
- I thought you handled it well.
- Thank you.

310
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,120
Tough row to hoe,
you think about it.

311
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,520
What would that be?

312
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,960
Oh, all that money.

313
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,120
Ah.

314
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,720
A lot of responsibility.

315
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,320
Never knowing
who your friends are,

316
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,240
never knowing
what people value you for.

317
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,280
Yeah.

318
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,520
Must be tough.

319
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,880
Never feel sorry for
a man who owns a plane.

320
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,920
So... what do you
value me for, Bob?

321
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,040
Well, I tell you what...
I like your style.

322
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,080
And I think your wife’s
pretty cute, too.

323
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,120
Yes.

324
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:25,120
So... how are you planning
to kill me?

325
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,400
- Oh, fuck! Hold on!
- Oh, shit!

326
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,640
- What's happening?!
- Oh, no! Jesus!

327
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,000
Aah!

328
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,680
- God damn it!
- Look out!

329
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,840
Jesus!

330
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,280
Aah! Aah...

331
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,160
Bob!

332
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,760
OK, get him up. Get him up.

333
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,560
I got him.

334
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,600
Steve. Steve!

335
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,320
Anyone got any matches?

336
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,560
Got any matches?

337
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,680
Help me up.

338
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:07,560
We'll make a fire right here.
Make a fire.

339
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,680
That's better. Yeah.

340
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,200
Come on. Oh, God.

341
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,200
Come on.

342
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,840
Come on. Come on.

343
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,600
That's it. Come on. Oh, God.

344
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,720
Oh, shit.

345
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,800
I'm cold.

346
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,240
Let's stop fucking about,
shall we, and get the guy warm.

347
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:48,440
Hey, come on. We need those.
We need them.

348
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,520
Come on, Stephen, come on.
Come here.

349
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,160
I let the fire burn out.

350
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,440
We've only got
a few flares left.

351
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,960
Shouldn’t we keep them
for signaling?

352
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,680
What we need is...

353
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,800
What we want is wood-quite
a bit of it, for a signal fire.

354
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,160
When they come for us,
they'll see the smoke.

355
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,240
Huh?

356
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,720
- Why would they come for us?
- Hmm?

357
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,560
Well, they know
we went to the cabin.

358
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,440
When they go there,
they'll see the note.

359
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,360
Oh.

360
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,520
I'm afraid
we're in for a walk.

361
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,960
What's that mean,
'we're in for a walk"?

362
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,520
What the fuck does that mean?

363
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,760
I once read an interesting book.

364
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:23,280
It said that most people
lost in the wilds, they...

365
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,520
They die of shame.
What?

366
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,280
Yeah.

367
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,520
They die of shame.
'What did I do wrong?"

368
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,440
'How could I have gotten
myself into this?"

369
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:38,600
And so they sit there,
and they... die.

370
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:43,160
They didn't do the one thing
that would’ve saved their lives.

371
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,640
And what is that, Charles?

372
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,280
Thinking.

373
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,600
Look. Steve, look.

374
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,440
All right, here's the lodge.

375
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:59,240
Here's the cabin where
we were supposed to have gone.

376
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,840
This is where we did go-

377
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,720
through this pass,
mountains, river.

378
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,640
They'll be looking for us
in the south, all right?

379
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,920
If we can get back south
of this pass by tonight,

380
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,120
we can use the flares.

381
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,040
How do we find it in the woods?

382
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,480
Head south.

383
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,600
Aha. We head south. How do
we know which way is south?

384
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,240
OK, uh...

385
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,760
Look.

386
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,960
Point the hour hand at the sun.

387
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,800
Halfway between the hour hand
and 12:00 is south.

388
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,440
This is broken.
Give me your watch.

389
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,160
Mine's busted, too.

390
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,840
- Steve?
- It's lost.

391
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,280
OK. All right, I'll tell you.

392
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,720
Uh... the birds will be flying
south. We’ll follow them.

393
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,600
- What if we can't see them?
- Sorry I got us into this!

394
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,000
Stop that! Stop it!

395
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,760
Just stop it.

396
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,920
- Where are you going?
- Gonna make a compass.

397
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,120
Uh...

398
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:11,760
Right. You take a needle,
rub it on silk, magnetize it.

399
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,040
And, uh...

400
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,760
Here, place it on a leaf. Here.

401
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,760
You have a compass.

402
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,440
Who travels with a needle?

403
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,600
Ah.

404
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,640
Here.

405
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,120
Ha ha! Oh, shit.

406
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,160
You see? It works.

407
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,360
It works.

408
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,040
That peak is south.

409
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,240
- What if it isn't?
- Huh?

410
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,880
It is. Has no choice. It's drawn
by the Earth's magnetism.

411
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,720
I know how it works, Charles.

412
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,200
Good. Then you know.
That's south.

413
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,840
What do we do when we get there?

414
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,160
Take another sighting.

415
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,760
It doesn’t feel south, Charles.

416
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,000
Just because you're lost doesn't
mean your compass is broken.

417
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,600
Come on.

418
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,640
The Vikings would steer
their ship with a rope.

419
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,520
A rope?
How'd they do that, Charles?

420
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:07,080
They'd have these two set points
on the land...

421
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,680
they'd left behind
or sailed away from,

422
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:12,880
and they'd line them up,
and that would be their bearing.

423
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:17,280
Then they'd trail this long rope
behind the ship,

424
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:21,480
pointing it at those two
points-the hill or whatever.

425
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,360
You might want to conserve
your breath.

426
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,040
Oh, yeah. Yeah!

427
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,880
Gotto get through by nightfall.

428
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,360
Come on.

429
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,520
What are the odds
that they’ll see us,

430
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,000
that they’ll see the flares?

431
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,240
Dam fine.

432
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,400
You think so?

433
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:55,160
I don't know,
but I have to say so, don't I?

434
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,760
City boy.

435
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,880
- Charles.
- Yeah?

436
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:12,280
Is it my diseased imagination,
or did you say,

437
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,080
'How are you planning
to kill me?"

438
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,600
- Did you say that?
- Yeah.

439
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,560
What did that mean? Why would
I want to kill you, Charles?

440
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,120
For my wife.

441
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,160
- For Mickey?
- Yeah.

442
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,240
That's a bizarre way
to meet girls.

443
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,600
I'd kill you to get
next to your wife?

444
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,080
I've seen you with her.

445
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,560
Charles, baby...

446
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,960
We work together.

447
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:46,520
No.
I've seen the way you are.

448
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,400
No offense, Charles,
but I can get my own girl,

449
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,520
if you've noticed
since we've known each other.

450
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,320
And P. S., you're a powerful guy.

451
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:56,160
Why would I want
to antagonize you, Charles?

452
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,000
to get the money.

453
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,200
Oh.

454
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,440
The money.

455
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,520
Now it's the broad, now it's
the boodle. Nothing is safe.

456
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,560
Rich man. All anybody wants is
to take something from you,

457
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,280
and when they want it
bad enough, to kill you.

458
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,040
You know something, Charles?
The rich are different.

459
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,920
How far do you think it is?

460
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,920
Can't be more
than about 10 miles.

461
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,080
- Aah!
- What?

462
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,160
A stitch. A stitch in my side.

463
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,240
- Find a round stone.
- What?

464
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,280
Find a round stone.
Spit under it.

465
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,600
Old Indian remedy?

466
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,880
Yeah, that's right.

467
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,160
You think I'm a fool.

468
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,040
No. Old Indian remedy.
Makes sense.

469
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,760
Make him slow down,
find a round stone,

470
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,440
take his mind off it,
make him stretch, bend over.

471
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,840
You think I'm a fool
because of what I said.

472
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,600
- About what?
- About my wife.

473
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,280
Ah, what you said
about your wife.

474
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:27,400
What I think... I think that
you got too much money,

475
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,920
uh... latent homosexuality,
lots of other good stuff,

476
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,000
paranoia...

477
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,680
We'll all get together
when we get back,

478
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,720
you and me and your wife,
and we'll get into a hot tub...

479
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:41,200
and, um... bare our feelings,
and, um...

480
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:48,120
Look, even if I wanted to kill
you, I need you to get home,

481
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,600
you fucking idiot.

482
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,080
Needing people.
Isn't it a bitch?

483
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,280
- Who are we talking about?
- Fannie Farmer.

484
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,560
The mother of
level measurement here.

485
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,440
- Good to know you have a hero.
- Oh, cheering up, are we?

486
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,800
Regaining our impertinent,
feisty demeanor, eh?

487
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,280
It's good of you to notice.

488
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,400
Knows all, tells all.

489
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,480
Wait.

490
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,960
Listen, listen.

491
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,440
Come on.

492
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,200
Come on!

493
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,200
Charles, come on!

494
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:06,560
We'll never make it.
Now, then...

495
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,840
This tree. Come on! Hurry. Pull!

496
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,000
Steve, now! Pull! Help me!

497
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,160
Come on.

498
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,120
One, two, three!

499
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,840
Up!

500
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,200
Up!

501
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,920
OK.

502
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,840
Come on!

503
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,720
Easy!

504
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,280
Keep coming!

505
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,320
Charles, go!

506
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,120
- Yes!
- Take it easy, Charles.

507
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:34,360
Look out! Look out. Come on.

508
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,200
- Charles, it's OK.
- You got it. Come on!

509
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,360
- Just keep coming!
- Come on, Charles!

510
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,360
Just keep coming, Charles.

511
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,000
Keep coming!
Aah...

512
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,720
Charles!

513
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,920
Charles! Shit!
Hang on!

514
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,280
Oh-Jesus!

515
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,960
Charles, hang on! Hang on!

516
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,400
Charles! Char-

517
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:01,960
Hold on!

518
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,360
Aah...

519
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:17,280
Charles, hang on!
Aah!

520
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,760
- You OK?
- Yeah.

521
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,440
Let's go.

522
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,480
Oh, God.

523
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,760
I lost the flares.

524
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,000
We'll get by.
How?

525
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:21,320
I've got, uh...
six matches left.

526
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,600
A signal fire.
No.

527
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:29,240
We'll make a signal
fire. The plane will see us.

528
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,760
Charles?
Snap out of it, Charles.

529
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,560
It's gonna be fine, Charles.
It's gonna be fine.

530
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,000
Which way is it, Charles?

531
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,480
It's up there.

532
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,600
Man, come on.

533
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,640
Oh, God. Aah.

534
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:41,920
- You OK?
- Yeah.

535
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,120
OK.

536
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,320
You saved me.

537
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:47,360
Get over it.
I need you to navigate.

538
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,400
You saved me.

539
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,160
I couldn't kill you
with Stephen around.

540
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,520
I'd have to kill him, too.

541
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,400
Come on. You saved my life.

542
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,320
Buy me something nice
when we get home.

543
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,080
How do you like your coffee?

544
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:00,360
I like my coffee
like I like my women.

545
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:01,440
Bitter and murky.

546
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,120
I lost the bloody flares.

547
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:15,680
Hey, remember you told
me why people die in the woods?

548
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,200
Yeah, they die of shame.

549
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:18,800
Take a lesson from it.

550
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:21,840
We want to get up-top of
that rise, high as possible-

551
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,320
let the plane see the fire.

552
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:30,880
Why would they even
come looking for us?

553
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,720
Know what happens
when you misplace a billionaire?

554
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,920
Gonna make some story
when we get back home.

555
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:41,440
Yes. Quite a change from, "That
cab driver was so rude to me. "

556
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:00,880
See anything?

557
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,400
No.

558
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,240
Let's go.

559
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,080
Oh, my God.

560
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,480
Oh, shit.

561
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,480
OK, let's see.

562
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:00,000
Hey, maybe the buckle
threw it off.

563
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,440
- What are we gonna do?
- Well...

564
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,640
What are we going to do, OK?
We're going to die out here!

565
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,040
Nobody knows where we are,

566
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:16,240
and we don't know
what the hell we're doing here!

567
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:18,720
What are we gonna do?
We're gonna die!

568
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:21,560
Nobody knows where we are.
We got nothing to eat!

569
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,760
All right, Steve. Look.

570
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:29,680
Look here.
This is what we’re gonna do.

571
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:35,280
You see this?
Gonna make a spear, all right?

572
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:40,240
You... you want me to make
a fucking spear?

573
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:43,040
Yeah. We need you
to make one for fishing.

574
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:44,800
Go on, take that. Take it.

575
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:48,960
Good. Fine. OK, you can do that.

576
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:52,600
They'll never find us.

577
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:58,160
They will. And even if they
don't, we'll walk out of here.

578
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,440
Do as I say.

579
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:03,680
I'm gonna make afire.
Come on! Get on with it.

580
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:06,320
It'll be OK.

581
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,720
What is he gonna do,
make a spear?

582
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,560
Is he gonna fish for our dinner?

583
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:21,240
I wanted to give him
something to do, that's all.

584
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:24,800
Are they gonna come for us?
You are an important guy, right?

585
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:25,840
Right?

586
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,400
Look, I'm talking to you!

587
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:33,600
What would you like to do, huh?
Should we lay down and die?

588
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:37,600
Should we lie down and die?!

589
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:43,720
There's nobody here but us.

590
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:46,880
Have I missed something?

591
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:53,680
You're right.
You're right. I'm sorry.

592
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:55,680
OK.

593
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:57,720
God!

594
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:00,760
Shit!

595
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:03,440
Shit.

596
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:05,720
Take your hands away.
Aah...

597
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:09,320
Oh! Oh, it's...
Take your hands away.

598
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:11,920
Shit! What have I done?
What have I done?

599
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,240
Oh, shit...

600
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:16,240
Jesus.

601
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:17,520
It's deep.

602
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:19,280
I'm not gonna lose my leg!

603
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:20,600
It’ll be all right.

604
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,040
Oh...

605
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:24,480
- Press down, both hands.
- OK.

606
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:25,960
- Keep them there.
- OK.

607
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,600
All right? OK.

608
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:29,240
OK.

609
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,560
I'm gonna
pull this tight, OK?

610
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,040
Wait! All right.

611
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:39,600
OK.

612
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,040
Bury this.

613
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:46,200
Start building the fire.

614
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:49,840
You'll be all right.

615
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:53,040
Is that all right?
Not too tight?

616
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:54,760
No, it's great.
Good.

617
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:00,480
Well, it's a clean cut.
It bled clean.

618
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:05,760
If we change
the bandages regularly,

619
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,480
it should knit up fine.

620
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:12,480
Guess I'm no lumberjack.

621
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:13,600
Ah...

622
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:18,200
You're doing fine, Steve. Fine.

623
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:19,880
- You know something?
- What?

624
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:23,480
You're all right.

625
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:26,200
Am I?

626
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:30,440
No, I mean it.
Very thoughtful man.

627
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:33,080
- Thank you.
- And I appreciate it.

628
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:35,880
It's my pleasure.

629
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:39,320
Are we getting out of here?

630
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:43,080
Yes, we are.
How are we getting out?

631
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:44,240
Uh...

632
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,240
OK, you see this...

633
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:51,840
See that constellation?

634
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,320
Cassiopeia-the big W.

635
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:00,440
OK... try the right edge
of the W.

636
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:05,520
Points to the North Star.
The North Star is north.

637
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:08,600
Tomorrow, we walk south
to the river.

638
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,240
The river will take us home.

639
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:13,080
Will it work better
than that compass?

640
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:17,880
Yeah.

641
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,040
I hope so.

642
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,520
Why do people die in the woods?

643
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,280
They die of shame.

644
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,000
Yeah.

645
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,280
Puts things in perspective,
doesn't it?

646
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:53,040
What's that?

647
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:58,240
Out here. A little different
from the fashion world.

648
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:03,200
Different from snorting coke
off the girls' hipbones.

649
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,120
In what way?

650
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,360
Charles, you know,
you're starting to loosen up.

651
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:24,640
You think so?

652
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:26,960
That's my report.

653
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,400
- Huh?
- So?

654
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:23,640
What?

655
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:26,800
He's not that badly hurt.

656
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:31,000
Then what are our chances
when all is said and done?

657
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,120
We can walk out of here
and probably die,

658
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:35,600
or we can stay here,
and he'll certainly die.

659
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:37,040
I think our chances are good.

660
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,400
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

661
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:41,960
They're better than good.

662
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,160
We know that that’s north,
and that's...

663
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:53,040
Charles? Charles!

664
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:57,360
I told you we had to bury those.

665
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,000
What's the difference?
Hey!

666
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:01,320
We must get them down!
Why?

667
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:03,440
They put the smell of blood
in the air!

668
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:04,520
Hey!

669
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:07,480
I'm not climbing a tree
in the middle of a thunderstorm!

670
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:10,400
We have to get it down!
You climb the tree!

671
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:12,520
Give me a hand.
I'll get them down.

672
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:14,040
Oh, shit!
What?

673
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:15,840
Oh, shit! Oh, sh-

674
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:23,640
Aah! Whoa! Oh, shit! Oh!

675
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,680
Charles, stay back!
Go away!

676
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:31,920
Aah!

677
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:34,080
Hyah!
Charles!

678
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:35,440
Charles, stay back!

679
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:48,280
Bob!

680
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:49,880
For God's sake, Charles!

681
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:53,000
Come on, Charles!

682
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,440
Stop!

683
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:02,520
Steve!

684
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:10,920
Steve!

685
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:17,280
Oh, God.

686
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:46,240
Come on! Come on!

687
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:36,160
We navigate by the stars.

688
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:39,800
We travel by night
if there's a moon.

689
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:41,520
We can't live out
the winter here.

690
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:45,840
The river will take us out.

691
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:50,200
They won't look for us
this far north?

692
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:52,560
We have to walk out.

693
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:55,040
Ah.

694
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,320
What do we eat?

695
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:01,160
I'm working on it.

696
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:44,960
Aah ha ha ha ha!

697
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,200
Whoo!

698
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:51,640
How about that?

699
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:54,600
Yeah!

700
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:58,480
Hey, is...

701
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:00,440
Hang on.

702
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:13,960
Come on!

703
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,120
Come on!

704
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:34,400
Wait!

705
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:44,840
Wait!

706
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:47,760
No!

707
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:53,240
No! Wait! Stop!

708
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:28,640
Oh, God.

709
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:43,520
Did you know that
you can make fire from ice?

710
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:49,440
You can make fire from ice.

711
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:51,480
Hello! I'm talking to you.

712
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:57,720
Do you know how that
could be done? Bob?

713
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,080
Can you think?

714
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:05,920
You... moneyed folk, isn't it?

715
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:11,120
- Isn't it?
- Fire from ice. You know how?

716
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:13,840
Sit up there, drinks and golf,
screwing the maid,

717
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:15,680
but get you in an emergency...

718
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:17,160
- Try.
- And you bloom.

719
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:21,040
You make me sick, you know that?

720
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:22,200
I'm sure I do.

721
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:23,720
Yo fuckin' make me sick!

722
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:26,880
I mean, what puts you off?
Jews and taxes!

723
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:28,720
Fire from ice.
Can you think how?

724
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:30,400
I don't want to know, Charles!

725
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:42,440
You have anything
you'd like to live for? Hmm?

726
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:48,800
You know something?
You know something?

727
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:52,040
Maybe we were right
to have let people like you...

728
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:53,560
run this country
all these years.

729
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:55,520
You're the only ones
dense enough!

730
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:58,880
I'm not dense,
I just have no imagination.

731
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:11,560
Making a decision tree,
is that it?

732
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:12,880
That's it, Bob.

733
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:27,520
We can't think they'd come back?

734
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:33,160
No. You shouldn’t think
they would come back.

735
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:37,840
They've scouted this area,
and they'll move on.

736
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:00,480
All right.

737
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:04,320
All right.

738
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:08,320
Fire from ice.

739
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:11,880
Let's have it.

740
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:16,400
Ice, if you take it
into your hands,

741
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:18,760
can be molded into a lens...

742
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:22,360
...which will concentrate
sunlight into fire.

743
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:24,440
Hmm?

744
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:42,880
I doubt we’ll be reduced to
that. We still have the matches.

745
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:45,280
I believe that's all we'll need.

746
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:58,000
Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus.

747
01:03:56,120 --> 01:04:00,200
Well, there's, uh...
there’s fish in there.

748
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:04,200
What will we use for tackle?
How will we bait them?

749
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:15,280
Wouldn't you find that
attractive?

750
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:19,160
I don't know. I, uh...

751
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:22,400
It's gold.
The whole world longs for it.

752
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:27,040
I'm not in a very humorous mood.

753
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:29,000
Come on.
Don't go native on me, Bob.

754
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:34,000
I'm sorry. I'm just tired.
I'm... very tired.

755
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:36,640
Why don’t you rest...
and gather some wood?

756
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:43,320
Bob! He's a man-killer-been
following us the whole time.

757
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:44,600
He's stalking us.

758
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:48,240
Come on!

759
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:10,080
He's toying with us.

760
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:16,360
What are we going to do,
Charles?

761
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:17,400
Huh?

762
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:20,280
What, do I have a plan?

763
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:24,920
Am I supposed to have a plan?
You tell me.

764
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:31,560
We can't move.
It won’t let us eat.

765
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:35,960
Well... we're going
to starve up here.

766
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:55,080
What are we gonna do?

767
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:01,640
We're gonna kill him.

768
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:13,600
We get him to attack.
Spear, bait.

769
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:17,360
Induce a charge.
Bear charges and rears.

770
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:19,840
As he falls,
he impales himself on the spear.

771
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:24,920
Same principle as the deadfall-
use his own weight to kill him.

772
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:29,760
What are we gonna use
to bait him?

773
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:31,280
We lure him.

774
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:32,800
- What?
- We lure him!

775
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:39,720
You know... Masai boys in Africa,
11 years old,

776
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:41,480
they kill lions with spears.

777
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:45,560
How do we... "lure" him?

778
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:48,480
Eleven-year-old boys
kill a lion.

779
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:51,520
Indian boys used to run up
to the bear and slap him-

780
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:53,720
count coup on him
as a test of manhood.

781
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:57,920
No, no, Charles.
How are we going to lure him?

782
01:10:57,960 --> 01:10:59,000
Blood.

783
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:03,360
Blood!

784
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:06,720
We'll have to distract him,
of course.

785
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:12,160
We'll have to distract him and
trap him, but it can be done.

786
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:15,400
Do you believe it, Bob?
You believe it?

787
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:16,800
- I don't know, Charles.
- Huh?

788
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:18,800
- I don’t think it'll work.
- It will work!

789
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:19,880
No.

790
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:22,800
It will work. What one man
can do, another can do.

791
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:24,640
You can't kill the bear,
Charles. He's...

792
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:29,960
He's ahead of us all the time,
like he's reading our minds.

793
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,760
He's stalking us,
for God's sakes!

794
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:37,160
You want to die out here, huh?

795
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:42,560
Well, then die.
But I tell you what...

796
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:47,600
I'm not gonna die. No, sirree.
I'm not gonna die.

797
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:51,040
No, I'm gonna kill the bear.

798
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:54,920
Say, "I'm gonna kill the bear. "

799
01:11:56,280 --> 01:12:00,160
Say it. "I'm gonna kill the
bear. I'm gonna kill the bear!"

800
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:02,440
Say it!

801
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:05,160
- I'm gonna kill the bear.
- Say it again!

802
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:07,240
- I'm gonna kill the bear.
- And again!

803
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:08,680
I'm gonna kill the bear!

804
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:10,960
Good. What one man can do,
another can do.

805
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,600
What one man can do,
another can do.

806
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:13,560
Say it again!

807
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:15,000
What one man can do,
another can do!

808
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,960
- And again!
- What one man can do...

809
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,400
another can do!

810
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:21,120
Yeah! You're goddamn right.

811
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:26,760
'Cause today... I'm a-gonna
kill the motherfucker.

812
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:16,000
Come on.

813
01:15:21,080 --> 01:15:22,240
Come on.

814
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:26,440
Now.

815
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:45,280
Run!

816
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,400
Aah! Oof!

817
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:00,960
Come on.

818
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:04,240
- Come on!
- All right.

819
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:32,760
Aah!

820
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:35,560
Aah!

821
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:39,240
Hey!

822
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:43,160
Come on,
you son of a bitch!

823
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:48,920
Hey!

824
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:52,160
Get him in the neck, Charles!

825
01:16:57,960 --> 01:16:59,760
Jesus. Jesus!

826
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:08,560
Over here! Come on! Come on!

827
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:09,720
Aah!

828
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:14,320
Come on, you son of a bitch!

829
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:16,680
Look out. Look out! Look out!

830
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:22,880
Come on!

831
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:30,120
Hey!

832
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:33,800
- Come on! Charles!
- Aah!

833
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:35,680
Charles!

834
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:38,000
Aah! Ohh!

835
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:48,840
Aah!

836
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:52,960
Hyah!

837
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:56,720
Come and get me!
Get me! Come and get-

838
01:17:56,760 --> 01:17:57,760
Come on!

839
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:04,400
Come on! Come on!
Come on, you son of a bitch!

840
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:05,720
Aah!

841
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:08,680
Come here, you motherfucker!
Come and get me!

842
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:11,760
Charles!

843
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:13,800
- Come and get me!
- Charles!

844
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:17,400
Come on! Come on, get me!
Come on, get me!

845
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:19,120
Look out!

846
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:21,040
Charles, look out! Charles!

847
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:25,040
Aah!

848
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:28,600
Unh!

849
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:29,720
Char-

850
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:54,240
Charles?

851
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:06,440
Charles?

852
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:21,640
Wish we had some salt.

853
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:28,120
You know, you can... you can
season meat with gunpowder.

854
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:29,480
Did you know that?

855
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:32,000
Wish we had some gunpowder.

856
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:39,200
I don't suppose
you made one for me?

857
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:40,520
Yeah.

858
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:45,960
Hey... ahem.

859
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:50,960
- What do you think?
- Oh, yeah.

860
01:20:57,480 --> 01:20:59,280
What's the matter, Charles?

861
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:00,400
Nothing.

862
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:03,120
No, really. What?

863
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,440
All my life, I wanted to do
something that was...

864
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:13,360
...that was unequivocal.

865
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:18,720
Well, Charlie, I certainly
think this qualifies.

866
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:20,920
It's something.

867
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:25,120
See, Charles, that's why
they call it "personal growth. "

868
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:27,000
A month ago,
Smokey would've reared up,

869
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:28,720
you probably would've
called your lawyer.

870
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:32,800
Nah. I wouldn't do that
to an animal.

871
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:07,920
OK?

872
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:35,880
So I said, uh...

873
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:40,640
I said, "If this is my life,
then this is my life. "

874
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:43,320
But you can change your life.

875
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:45,760
That's what I'm telling you.

876
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:48,080
Yeah. Is that true?

877
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:50,200
Well, why wouldn't it be true?

878
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:56,080
Because I never knew anybody who
did actually change their lives.

879
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:01,920
I tell you what...

880
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:05,280
I'm going to start my life over.

881
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:09,520
Yeah.

882
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:15,880
You'd be the first.

883
01:23:17,160 --> 01:23:18,160
Yeah.

884
01:24:54,360 --> 01:24:56,560
No one's been here
for quite a while.

885
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:30,560
- What do you make of it?
- Lf we're here...

886
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:33,840
That canoe's gonna take us
right out.

887
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:37,480
You know what we gotto do?
Find out if that canoe floats.

888
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:39,560
Yeah.

889
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:49,680
Hey, it floats!

890
01:25:49,720 --> 01:25:50,720
Yeah.

891
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:55,760
Cup of tea?

892
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:56,800
Yeah.

893
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:32,760
- Ain't got that fire lit yet?
- No.

894
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:51,400
Drinking the other fellow’s
supplies?

895
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:58,880
Get back...
I'll send him a check.

896
01:28:02,240 --> 01:28:03,960
Send him a check.
Yeah.

897
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:15,320
Hell of an adventure,
eh, Charles?

898
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:18,080
Yeah, wasn't it?

899
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,160
You know...

900
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:28,840
I ought to tell you...

901
01:28:30,760 --> 01:28:33,440
If I'd had my camera,
I would've made my fortune.

902
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:37,440
Made my fortune.

903
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:50,920
That thing’s busted to shit,
isn't it?

904
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:54,080
It still has some...
sentimental value.

905
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:57,200
I suppose it does.

906
01:29:08,680 --> 01:29:10,880
Can I see your watch, Bob?

907
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:16,960
My watch?

908
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:20,320
Don’t work. I told you. Busted.

909
01:29:22,160 --> 01:29:25,440
I know... I know it doesn’t work,
but could I see it?

910
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:29,680
New when we left.

911
01:29:32,440 --> 01:29:34,040
Just a piece of junk now.

912
01:29:40,360 --> 01:29:43,040
What's the matter, Bob?
Can't do it sober?

913
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:46,640
Yeah.

914
01:29:48,160 --> 01:29:50,320
I suppose you don't
need me anymore.

915
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:52,520
You can find your own way
out of here.

916
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:55,760
You had no business
with that broad, anyway.

917
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:57,080
You know you don't.

918
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:03,040
You know you don't, Charles.

919
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,800
Hey, hey, hey...

920
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:09,280
Look at her.
Why did she go with you?

921
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:11,520
Why in the hell
did she go with you?

922
01:30:11,560 --> 01:30:14,640
Your money, for the love of God.
Everyone in the world knew that.

923
01:30:16,240 --> 01:30:17,520
Are you nuts?

924
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:22,960
You went through the airport
with her, everyone said,

925
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,640
'There goes a guy with a plane. "

926
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:31,000
'There goes a guy with a plane. "

927
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:36,800
I'd say you drew tough luck
this time, Charles.

928
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:41,760
Well...

929
01:30:44,120 --> 01:30:45,200
That's right.

930
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:48,880
Yeah.

931
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:55,760
'For all the nights. "

932
01:30:57,320 --> 01:30:58,800
How touching.

933
01:30:58,840 --> 01:31:00,600
Why torture yourself?

934
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:04,640
It's over now.

935
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:15,800
Let's go outside.

936
01:31:30,120 --> 01:31:31,480
Just tell me one thing.

937
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:36,000
Was it from the first,
you and my wife?

938
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:38,520
Was it from the first, Bob?

939
01:31:39,480 --> 01:31:41,120
Come on, Charles.

940
01:31:41,160 --> 01:31:43,960
Ah. Is that
an indelicate question?

941
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:48,120
Come on, Charles. Done is done.

942
01:31:50,360 --> 01:31:53,440
Well, I'm dying, so...
what difference does it make?

943
01:31:55,560 --> 01:31:57,320
Why is that so important to you?

944
01:32:03,320 --> 01:32:04,600
I love her.

945
01:32:06,640 --> 01:32:08,640
I'm sorry. It's time.

946
01:32:10,720 --> 01:32:12,880
- Don't do it.
- You live in a dream world.

947
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:14,160
You always have.

948
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:18,320
- Now turn your back.
- You don't have to do it.

949
01:32:18,360 --> 01:32:20,560
The hell I don't.
You know that I do.

950
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:22,960
What the fuck are you thinking?
Now turn your back.

951
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,400
I don't want to hear
any more of your nonsense.

952
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:27,440
I don't want to hear it!

953
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:31,840
How close we've become
and how this and how that...

954
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:34,560
You'd have died out here without
me, with all your wealth!

955
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:39,280
You understand me?
I said turn your goddamn back!

956
01:32:41,320 --> 01:32:43,720
- Bob, listen to me.
- Don't go any further, Charles.

957
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:48,280
I said turn your back.

958
01:32:51,680 --> 01:32:52,720
No?

959
01:32:57,040 --> 01:33:01,400
You know, life is a short thing,
Charles, full of betrayal.

960
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:03,320
In many ways,
you're well out of it.

961
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:06,280
- Bob...
- Charles, don't-aah!

962
01:33:08,760 --> 01:33:10,440
Be careful of the deadfall.

963
01:33:20,920 --> 01:33:22,600
Aah...

964
01:33:22,640 --> 01:33:25,480
Aah... oh, God, Charles. Oh, God!

965
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:27,760
Aah... oh, God,
I think I've broken my...

966
01:33:29,640 --> 01:33:31,880
I think I've broken my leg,
Charles.

967
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:36,120
Oh, God, Charles. Aah!

968
01:33:36,160 --> 01:33:39,440
God. Oh, my God. Oh, God...

969
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:01,560
Oh, God, Charles, no. Please.

970
01:34:10,760 --> 01:34:11,880
All right.

971
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,520
Aah! Aah...

972
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:18,320
Now, try and lie still.

973
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:20,920
All right.

974
01:34:37,240 --> 01:34:38,360
All right.

975
01:34:39,640 --> 01:34:40,640
OK.

976
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:46,960
OK, Bob.

977
01:34:51,040 --> 01:34:52,920
I'll take a look
and see what's wrong.

978
01:34:54,160 --> 01:34:57,000
- I don’t feel very well.
- Take a shot of this.

979
01:35:00,760 --> 01:35:01,880
All right.

980
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:06,720
I'm taking a...
just going to take a look here.

981
01:35:10,200 --> 01:35:11,480
Ow!

982
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:15,200
Hold on.

983
01:35:18,920 --> 01:35:21,520
I suppose I only have
so much of that in me.

984
01:35:21,560 --> 01:35:22,680
- Yeah.
- Charles?

985
01:35:24,360 --> 01:35:26,800
Charles, what is it?
What is it, Charles?

986
01:35:28,360 --> 01:35:30,240
I... I don’t feel very...

987
01:35:32,320 --> 01:35:34,800
I can't say I feel
very well at all, Charles.

988
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:42,680
Hell of a guy. Hell of a guy.
I never told you that.

989
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:47,480
Fucking shithole of a world,
eh, Charles?

990
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:49,040
Yeah.

991
01:35:49,080 --> 01:35:50,880
Shithole of a world.

992
01:35:50,920 --> 01:35:52,760
Yeah. OK.

993
01:35:54,280 --> 01:35:55,760
- I need you to...
- What?

994
01:35:55,800 --> 01:35:58,200
I need you
to put pressure on it.

995
01:35:58,240 --> 01:36:00,560
Aah! No-aah!

996
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:04,120
Bob?

997
01:36:04,160 --> 01:36:05,240
Aah...

998
01:36:12,440 --> 01:36:13,480
Bob?

999
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:18,000
Yeah.

1000
01:36:22,200 --> 01:36:23,320
Jesus.

1001
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:22,200
Ah...

1002
01:37:22,240 --> 01:37:23,400
Bob?

1003
01:37:26,720 --> 01:37:28,160
Listen.

1004
01:37:29,120 --> 01:37:31,920
We're going to get you
out of here, OK?

1005
01:38:25,040 --> 01:38:27,400
Hell of a way to end an outing,
eh, Charles?

1006
01:38:29,480 --> 01:38:30,720
You'll be fine.

1007
01:38:32,680 --> 01:38:34,080
It must be quite a thing...

1008
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:36,880
Quite a thing... to have so much.

1009
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:44,440
Everybody...
wants something from you...

1010
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:46,880
Everybody depending on you.

1011
01:38:48,120 --> 01:38:49,320
Don’t talk so much.

1012
01:38:52,280 --> 01:38:53,520
They're so pushy.

1013
01:38:54,240 --> 01:38:55,520
Save your energy.

1014
01:38:56,600 --> 01:39:00,480
I... I don't really feel
quite 100 percent, Charles.

1015
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:03,640
I'm going to take us
into shore,

1016
01:39:03,640 --> 01:39:06,000
find us a fire, keep you warm.

1017
01:39:19,480 --> 01:39:20,560
Hey.

1018
01:39:22,920 --> 01:39:25,360
Why would you save
a piece of shit like me?

1019
01:39:26,240 --> 01:39:27,560
Let's say it's a challenge.

1020
01:39:29,680 --> 01:39:31,760
The sporting aspect of it, eh?

1021
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:34,720
- Yeah.
- No. I know what it is.

1022
01:39:36,280 --> 01:39:39,600
You never had a buddy.
That's the thing, isn't it?

1023
01:39:39,640 --> 01:39:40,840
That's right.

1024
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:42,760
Now I'm your pet project.

1025
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,640
I'm your hobby farm,
eh, Charles?

1026
01:39:48,360 --> 01:39:49,760
Yeah. Whatever you say, Bob.

1027
01:39:51,080 --> 01:39:53,920
The guy who tried to kill you.
That's terrific, Charles.

1028
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,280
Nah, you wouldn't have done it.

1029
01:39:56,320 --> 01:39:59,760
Yes, I would've,
you stupid son of a bitch.

1030
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:02,800
Yes, I would.

1031
01:40:12,240 --> 01:40:14,240
Well, then... you would.

1032
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:22,440
What'll you do
when you get back?

1033
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:25,720
Huh? Ah, it's not important.

1034
01:40:27,680 --> 01:40:29,080
It is important to me.

1035
01:40:33,280 --> 01:40:34,960
I may not go back.

1036
01:40:38,640 --> 01:40:40,760
What do you mean?
Of course you'll go back.

1037
01:40:42,680 --> 01:40:43,880
To what?

1038
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:49,280
No, I don’t feel sorry
for you, Charles.

1039
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:53,400
Never feel sorry for a man
that owns a plane.

1040
01:40:55,440 --> 01:40:58,680
Come on. Hold on. Hold on.

1041
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:01,360
I'll get us out of here.

1042
01:41:03,240 --> 01:41:04,240
Bullshit.

1043
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:08,960
Hey... I'm dying.

1044
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:13,320
I'm dying, and I never did
a goddamn thing.

1045
01:41:15,800 --> 01:41:16,960
But wait.

1046
01:41:17,680 --> 01:41:19,160
Charles, I gotto tell you.

1047
01:41:21,440 --> 01:41:22,720
- Charles...
- What?

1048
01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:27,680
I'm sorry.

1049
01:41:30,640 --> 01:41:32,080
I'm sorry, what I did.

1050
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:37,720
And your wife, Charles...
Listen to me, Charles.

1051
01:41:38,640 --> 01:41:41,680
She was never in on it,
this business...

1052
01:41:45,160 --> 01:41:46,320
Doing you in.

1053
01:41:47,960 --> 01:41:49,600
I swear it on my life.

1054
01:41:52,920 --> 01:41:53,920
Charles...

1055
01:41:55,520 --> 01:41:58,920
Thanks. Very kind of you
to say so, Bob.

1056
01:42:02,120 --> 01:42:04,600
Never too late for
a kind gesture, eh, Charles?

1057
01:42:06,040 --> 01:42:07,440
Don't die on me, Bob.

1058
01:42:12,120 --> 01:42:13,560
Don’t tell me what to do.

1059
01:42:20,040 --> 01:42:21,080
Hold on.

1060
01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:24,600
We're getting out.

1061
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:33,480
Hey!

1062
01:42:34,680 --> 01:42:36,080
Over here!

1063
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:38,720
Over here!

1064
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:40,960
Hey!

1065
01:43:00,200 --> 01:43:01,280
Hey!

1066
01:43:05,840 --> 01:43:08,720
Hey! Over here!

1067
01:43:09,720 --> 01:43:10,720
Hey!

1068
01:43:23,400 --> 01:43:24,400
Hey!

1069
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:28,840
Hey!

1070
01:43:38,560 --> 01:43:40,360
Bob! Ha!

1071
01:45:51,440 --> 01:45:53,600
Why is the rabbit unafraid?

1072
01:45:55,560 --> 01:45:58,160
'Cause he's smarter
than the panther.

1073
01:45:58,200 --> 01:45:59,200
Yeah.

1074
01:46:13,280 --> 01:46:16,080
Mr. Morse! Mr. Morse!

1075
01:46:16,120 --> 01:46:18,960
Mr. Morse, Channel 9 News.
Can we get a statement, sir?

1076
01:46:30,200 --> 01:46:32,800
Hey, hold back.
Give the man some space.

1077
01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:06,440
Mr. Morse?
Mr. Morse?

1078
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:09,520
Mrs. Morse?

1079
01:47:09,560 --> 01:47:12,360
Mrs. Morse, how did you feel
during your husband's ordeal?

1080
01:47:16,600 --> 01:47:17,680
Uh...

1081
01:47:19,160 --> 01:47:20,600
We're all put to the test.

1082
01:47:21,640 --> 01:47:24,920
But it never comes in the form
or at the...

1083
01:47:26,920 --> 01:47:29,680
...point we would prefer,
does it?

1084
01:47:31,880 --> 01:47:35,120
Mr. Morse,
the other men, your friends...

1085
01:47:37,280 --> 01:47:38,400
My friends...

1086
01:47:41,720 --> 01:47:43,040
What happened to them?

1087
01:47:46,840 --> 01:47:48,440
How did they die, sir?

1088
01:47:54,640 --> 01:47:55,760
They died...

1089
01:47:56,840 --> 01:47:58,120
...saving my life.
