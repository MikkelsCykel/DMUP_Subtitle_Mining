00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,434
That may just be baby talk,
but, Stan...

2
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:17,701
...look at them and tell me
they're not communicating.

3
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:20,072
Honey, this is a big day.

4
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:24,307
When you're in business with Biscane
Broadcasting, you've hit the big time.

5
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:27,578
- Hello?
- Honey, did you hear anything I said?

6
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:30,655
- Yes, of course I heard you.
- What did I say?

7
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:32,382
What'd you say?

8
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:36,051
I said, don't you think
the babies are communicating?

9
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:39,096
Honey, where's my jacket?

10
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:43,133
Hello. Yeah.
Hi, is this Biscane Broadcasting?

11
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:45,294
Hi, this is Stan Bobbins.

12
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:47,472
No, not Dan. Stan.

13
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:59,281
Oh, and those World War II
rescue missions?

14
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:03,588
What kind of milk you drinking?

15
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:07,016
- What?
- A baby...

16
00:02:07,193 --> 00:02:09,320
...who can perform
superhuman feats...

17
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:12,158
...communicate to both
babies and adults...

18
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:14,493
...and defend the children
of the world.

19
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:18,933
That creates a paradox
which defies rational elucidation.

20
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:20,766
In English, Finkleman.

21
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:26,168
I think he's saying
you're full of...

22
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:30,449
- Sorry.
- What kind of milk you drinking, Alex?

23
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,620
And you're trying to tell us...

24
00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:39,781
...that this Kahuna is related to both
you and your cousins Sly and Whit?

25
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:43,690
Oh, whoa. Wait a minute.
What don't you understand?

26
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:46,832
Look, sit back and let me
tell you another story...

27
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,369
...about the legendary Kahuna
and his archenemy, Captain Kane.

28
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:56,168
<i>This one happened
a long, long time ago...</i>

29
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:58,276
<i>...in East Berlin in 1962.</i>

30
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,313
<i>You know, the Berlin Wall
and all that stuff?</i>

31
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:22,858
<i>Now, we've heard
about all kinds of superheroes.</i>

32
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:27,200
<i>Superman, Superwoman,
Superthis, Superthat.</i>

33
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:31,002
<i>And they always do super things
and save everybody.</i>

34
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:33,737
<i>But this is the story
of a real superhero...</i>

35
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:37,212
<i>...a little boy who looks
after the children of the world.</i>

36
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,650
<i>All the children.</i>

37
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:42,616
Showtime.

38
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:57,870
Locking in four-wheel drive.

39
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:24,160
<i>Kahuna's archenemy, Captain Kane,
had dreams of controlling the world.</i>

40
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:28,097
<i>And he did all kinds
of bad things.</i>

41
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,195
- My dear Petrov.
- Captain Kane.

42
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:35,301
Always a pleasure to see you.

43
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:40,110
- To our work.
- To our work.

44
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:48,616
It's wonderful what you do here,
saving orphaned children.

45
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:54,726
I have a soft spot
for the gentle laughter of babies.

46
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:05,600
<i>Kane knew if he could control
children, he could control the world.</i>

47
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:09,230
<i>He captured children trying
to escape through the Berlin Wall...</i>

48
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:12,742
<i>...and sent them to his secret
camps all over East Germany.</i>

49
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,285
<i>Capturing orphaned children?</i>

50
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:30,486
<i>If you think the Kahuna was
about to let Kane get away with that...</i>

51
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,255
<i>...think again.</i>

52
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:38,533
<i>If there were ever children who
needed his help, these were them.</i>

53
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:41,139
I'm scared, Peter.

54
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:45,243
It's okay, Greta.
We'll find a way out of this.

55
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,458
That could've hurt someone.

56
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:09,195
- It's a boy.
- It's a boy?

57
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:10,664
- It's what?
- Who're you?

58
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:14,170
Name's Kahuna,
and I'm busting you kids out of here.

59
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,832
He's saving us. He's saving us.

60
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,477
All right, let's go.

61
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:32,346
This tunnel leads to the courtyard
of the U.S. Embassy.

62
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:35,722
Go straight to Ambassador Clark.
Tell him Kahuna sent you.

63
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:39,654
- Thank you, Mr. Kahuna.
- Just doing my job, miss.

64
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:43,461
- Greta, hurry.
- You did good, kid.

65
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,232
Good luck.

66
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:48,698
<i>Mobilize every soldier
in the compound...</i>

67
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:52,502
...and secure the perimeter.
Kahuna must not escape.

68
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:56,375
Search this building.
All sectors.

69
00:06:56,549 --> 00:07:00,417
Sergeant, send four units
ahead to the Wall.

70
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:05,323
Seal off the compound.
Find those brats. I want Kahuna.

71
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:10,053
Hey, prissy pants, don't wet
yourself. I'm right here.

72
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,355
So we meet again...

73
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:17,534
...my little archenemy.
- You better watch it, Kane.

74
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:21,230
- Those things'll kill you.
- And those things...

75
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,537
...will give you cavities.

76
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:26,811
That's okay,
I've still got my baby teeth.

77
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:29,607
It's the end of the road for you.

78
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:35,913
- Don't I get one last word?
- That's a little cliché, don't you think?

79
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:38,079
But I'm intrigued.

80
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:40,053
What is your last word?

81
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,727
Duck.

82
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:47,196
"Duck" is your last word?
"Duck. "

83
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:53,329
Duck!

84
00:07:56,142 --> 00:08:00,135
My leg. His machine
has damaged my leg.

85
00:08:00,713 --> 00:08:02,180
Get him!

86
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:04,282
- What are you waiting for?
- Bottle!

87
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:06,979
Get him before he...

88
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:12,747
No! Too late.

89
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:21,027
You see? You see?

90
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:24,030
I told you. It's too late.

91
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:27,104
Now it's over. No.

92
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:31,504
Look at that. I warned you.

93
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,872
It's playtime.

94
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,648
One potato, two potato,
three potato, four.

95
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:42,379
Five potato, six potato,
seven potato, more.

96
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:45,589
Didn't your mothers tell you
not to play with guns?

97
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:10,445
I'll do it.

98
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,940
I'll finish you off.

99
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:23,594
One day I will be... I will destroy
you if it takes me forever.

100
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:27,324
<i>And then Kahuna utilized
his turbojet propulsion...</i>

101
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,731
<i>...and jumped that Mustang
right over the Berlin Wall.</i>

102
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,895
<i>A Mustang G T at the Berlin Wall...</i>

103
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:38,134
<i>- ... back in the '60s?
- Man, you tripping, Archie.</i>

104
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:42,508
That's how the Kahuna saved
the orphans of East Berlin.

105
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:45,048
Any questions? Rosita?

106
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:46,946
Still not convinced, Finkleman?

107
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:50,850
Cool it, Archie. It's your mom
and dad. Act like babies.

108
00:09:54,493 --> 00:09:58,725
- Somebody pick up the phone.
- Are you having a good day?

109
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:00,957
- Is that Daniel and Jasmine?
- Jean, I...

110
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:03,795
- Hi, guys.
- I don't know why you're opposed.

111
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,097
This will put Bobbins' World
on the map.

112
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:10,038
Allowing a huge satellite
network access to this facility...

113
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:12,575
...and using kids
as marketing subjects...

114
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:16,044
...it's everything we stand against.
- It's about marketing.

115
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:18,911
Bobbins' World will be
the McDonald's of daycare.

116
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:21,883
Great. We'll be known as McBaby.

117
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:25,182
Honey, this is new territory for you...

118
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:27,417
...maybe you should talk
to Dan first.

119
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:31,359
He's out of the country working
for UNICEF.

120
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,658
Besides, I'm running
Bobbins' World now. Okay?

121
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:38,463
I don't need to run to big brother Dan,
the baby guru, for help.

122
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:42,096
Archie's father could give him
a bit more attention sometimes.

123
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:47,644
Who needs that junk? Better he learn
up-front that it's a cold, cruel world...

124
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:51,772
...and you gotta tough it out on your
own. Heck, I don't need nobody.

125
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:54,679
Ever consider sensitivity training?

126
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:58,989
I am gonna... Okay, I am
gonna turn Bobbins' World...

127
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:02,559
...into the biggest chain
of daycare centers in the world.

128
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:09,160
Man, I'm hungry. Yo, Mrs. B,
girl needs a snack!

129
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:14,605
For the last time, Rosita, the adults
don't understand our language.

130
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:17,174
To attract their attention,
one must speak...

131
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:20,278
...in the only baby language
they seem to comprehend.

132
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:22,107
Which is?

133
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:27,777
Oh, yeah. Crying.

134
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:30,649
Here we go.

135
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:36,153
I need to ask you a question
about the big-screen monitor.

136
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:39,957
Honey the kids are hungry.
Michelle, bring some bottles.

137
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:43,226
Sharon, can you get some bottles
here? Thank goodness.

138
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:44,835
Works every time.

139
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:07,551
My leg. This leg
is always killing me.

140
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:11,629
- Tell them to get away.
- Not now.

141
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:17,861
Mr. Biscane, Mr. Bobbins.

142
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:20,437
- Pleasure.
- Dan?

143
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:22,870
It's Stan.

144
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:28,679
He likes you.

145
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:34,715
I like him.

146
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:38,715
Okay, sweeties,
today is Wednesday...

147
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:43,294
...which means we have
a very special guest for storytime.

148
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:47,125
That's right, kiddies.
My name's Kylie, sweetheart. Hey.

149
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:51,861
I don't like to brag about her, even
though she is an honor student...

150
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:56,872
...the most beautiful girl in school and
the president of the literature club.

151
00:12:57,042 --> 00:13:00,773
Oh, Archie. Come on.
Come on, Finkie. Come and sit down.

152
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:03,540
We are gonna read
about Cinderella.

153
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:07,908
Once upon a time, a lovely
young girl named Cinderella...

154
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:12,281
...lived in a grand mansion with
her stepmother and two stepsisters.

155
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:18,294
<i>Kylie reads with passion. The words
literally dance right off the page.</i>

156
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:24,264
- Looks like someone's in love.
- Peasant.

157
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:28,469
<i>Finkleman and Kylie

158
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:32,270
<i>K- I-S-S-I-N-G</i>

159
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:35,241
Knock it off, you mugs.
The lady's trying to work.

160
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:37,840
What are you guys
blabbering about?

161
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:41,350
Oh, they're not babbling.
They're talking.

162
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,012
I just wish we could understand
what they're talking about.

163
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,761
Mr. Bill Biscane.

164
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:54,295
The chairman of Biscane
Satellite Systems.

165
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:58,232
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

166
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:02,772
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

167
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:07,208
We are here to celebrate the future.

168
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:11,042
Not a future of flying cars
and spaceships.

169
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:16,280
The real future is in the hands
of one group. Our children.

170
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:21,482
I have a soft spot for
the gentle laughter of babies.

171
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:25,889
<i>- What did he say?
- And so it is my greatest pleasure...</i>

172
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:29,531
...to announce the launch
of the largest children's network...

173
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:33,063
...in television history.
It will be delivered...

174
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:37,175
...via the new Biscane Telespace
3000 Satellite.

175
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:41,001
And we call this network
Kidz Everywhere.

176
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:47,511
<i>We will take input from the children
themselves, making this the first...</i>

177
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:51,553
<i>...true interactive network
by kids for kids.</i>

178
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,158
<i>- It's him. It's Biscane.
- Sadly...</i>

179
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:57,159
<i>...Dan Bobbins
cannot be here with us.</i>

180
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:59,695
We have, on behalf
of Bobbins' World...

181
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:03,357
...Dan Bobbins' half brother,
Stanley.

182
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:05,664
Mr. Bobbins?

183
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:12,842
- I'm his real brother.
- Doesn't matter.

184
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:19,173
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

185
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:23,685
This has been a dream of mine
for quite a while now and...

186
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:28,925
It's coming together now. I can finally
see your plan in all its magnificence...

187
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,460
As I've told you
many times before...

188
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:35,532
...I will win,
even if it takes forever.

189
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:38,200
<i>That's Captain Kane,
from Berlin.</i>

190
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:42,704
Sweetie, what're you doing in here?
Looking out at all the exciting things?

191
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,275
You should get
with the other kids. Yeah.

192
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:48,538
Ladies and gentlemen,
if I may have your attention...

193
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:58,351
Oh, my gosh, guys.
Biscane. I think he's Kane!

194
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:02,324
Sometimes, Archie, I think all you
do is blurt out the first thing...

195
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:05,361
...that pops into your mind.
- I'm not a brain baby.

196
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:09,228
I'm a baby of action.
All right, maybe it's not him.

197
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:12,427
Anyway, Biscane, I don't like him.

198
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:15,596
What are we gonna do
about this Biscane?

199
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:19,005
- No fear, Finkie's here.
- Quentin Finkleman...

200
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:24,013
...you're just the guy I'm looking for.
- Okay then, what's our plan this time?

201
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:27,616
We're not supposed to be here.

202
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,980
I'm getting sick to my stomach.

203
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:38,154
Okay, Finkleman, you're
the computer geek. Now what?

204
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:42,892
- I prefer the term "computer artisan. "
- Whatever.

205
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:46,868
All right, all right.
Type in "Bill Biscane. "

206
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:50,633
Ignore the official sites
for Biscane Broadcasting...

207
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:54,472
...or anything like that.
There's usually some rogue ones.

208
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:56,409
You know, anti-corporate sites.

209
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:01,112
- What's wrong with you, Finkleman?
- I feel faint.

210
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:03,652
- You're always scared.
- Look!

211
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:06,518
See what it says up there?
Criminal!

212
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:09,091
Biscane. It says he's
a corporate criminal.

213
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:12,753
Are you crazy?
That's just website spam.

214
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:21,629
Red alert!
It's Biscane's flunkies!

215
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:23,866
- What do we do?
- Run!

216
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:27,069
- Come on, Fink.
- Wait, don't leave me!

217
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:31,976
Oh, no!

218
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:41,020
Come on.

219
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,694
This building wasn't up to code.

220
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:45,989
- Meaning?
- I couldn't possibly do it...

221
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:48,690
You have until tomorrow
to do what's necessary.

222
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:50,562
- That's impossible.
- People.

223
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,432
We won't have a problem
with building inspectors.

224
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:56,768
Mr. Biscane has paid
off thousands of petty bureaucrats...

225
00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:59,410
...from here to New York.

226
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,375
<i>What have I done?</i>

227
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:06,276
- What was that?
- It's a baby.

228
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:09,713
And he overheard
everything we said.

229
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:13,582
What's he gonna do,
call the FBI?

230
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:16,524
Get him. He knows something.

231
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:21,993
<i>- Tell us what you know.
- Oh, no.</i>

232
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:23,657
Hey, pock face.

233
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:31,267
It's him! It's the Kahuna!
I knew he'd come!

234
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:34,412
- Pick on somebody half your size.
- I knew it.

235
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,615
Who the heck are you?

236
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,650
Your worst nightmare.
A small fry with a big attitude.

237
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:50,289
Have a seat.

238
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,465
You a gambling man?

239
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:01,431
Heads, I win. Tails, you lose.

240
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:04,508
Heads, I win. Tails, you lose.

241
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:12,508
That was fun. But we gotta run.
See you.

242
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:21,319
- Find that brat.
- That was Kahuna.

243
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,654
I knew he'd come.

244
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,339
That was Kahuna.

245
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:46,208
- I'm sorry that we panicked.
- I thought for sure you'd be a goner.

246
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:48,649
Yeah, I was until
the Kahuna saved me.

247
00:19:49,154 --> 00:19:51,349
Archie, this is getting serious.

248
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:55,918
You believe me,
don't you, Rosita?

249
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:59,461
I believe Kahuna
was with you, in spirit.

250
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:02,623
You'd best have a talk
with your inner adult.

251
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:04,894
Inner adult.

252
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:08,969
- What about my computer?
- A new one will be here.

253
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:11,575
- We'll take care of everything.
- A wig.

254
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:14,576
That's gotta be Kahuna's disguise.

255
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:18,977
The kids will be out of the way when
your men are working tomorrow.

256
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:21,346
- Don't worry about that.
- Poor Archie.

257
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:24,622
Yeah. He's got serious
abandonment issues.

258
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:29,727
- We all have issues.
- Speak for yourself, brain boy.

259
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:34,764
I just mean that you quite
possibly have aggression issues...

260
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:37,595
...which may be tied
to a theme of mistrust...

261
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:41,535
...and, ultimately, fear of love.
- I don't have aggression issues.

262
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:45,403
Don't make me pound
on you to prove it.

263
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:48,669
Okay, Mrs. Tyson,
don't bite my ear off.

264
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:51,449
Brandon.

265
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:56,384
Brandon, thanks so much for
coming by. This is so cool of you.

266
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:58,682
I was pretty sure
I know why you called.

267
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:01,917
- So I got here right away.
- Okay, here it goes.

268
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,755
I know the guy usually asks...

269
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,361
It's cool. I was gonna
ask you anyway.

270
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:10,126
I mean, everyone knows
what a brainiac you are.

271
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:12,964
- Even the coach said so.
- Brainiac?

272
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:17,206
You know, I've gotta, like, make
a C-average to play football.

273
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:20,368
And I felt kind of weird asking
you to tutor me so...

274
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:24,276
...I'm glad you're asking me first.
- Tutor you. Right.

275
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:28,814
- You don't have any plans, right?
- No. No plans.

276
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:31,252
Cool.

277
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,994
Jerk. I hate jocks.

278
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,600
Three thousand dollars for books.

279
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,997
Uncle Stan, can I walk the kids
over to the children's museum?

280
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:52,837
No. Go ahead, Kylie.
They'll probably love it.

281
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:54,569
Kylie?

282
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:59,307
- Hey, you okay?
- I just need to get out for a while.

283
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:03,486
- Nothing short of a miracle.
- That's what Biscane's paying for.

284
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:06,123
Quit the jabbering,
give me the blooming disk.

285
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:08,725
- Thirty million dollars' worth.
- Try 60.

286
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:10,555
Look out.

287
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:16,065
You got them?
God, that was close.

288
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:18,099
Stupid girl!

289
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:21,261
Hope it's all right.

290
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:24,935
- What?
- Nothing. Nothing.

291
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:29,137
Oh, my God, it's gone.
Without that disk, we're sunk.

292
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:32,709
I could feel Kylie's heart shatter
into a million pieces.

293
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:35,114
- Poor Kylie.
- Man, if that were me...

294
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:37,517
...I would've popped him
in the kisser.

295
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,658
We have a problem.

296
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:45,227
Oh, no, I'm getting nauseous again.

297
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:58,042
- Go on, mister.
- Go on.

298
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:05,239
Go on. What do you want?

299
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:17,756
I don't know what's going on. We
gotta get out of here. Hold on, kids.

300
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:31,566
Fasten your seatbelts.
This might be a bumpy ride.

301
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:49,093
What do you want?

302
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:53,890
Leave us alone!

303
00:24:02,073 --> 00:24:03,062
- What...
- The...

304
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:05,539
Heck?

305
00:24:11,883 --> 00:24:13,475
It's the Kahuna.

306
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:22,757
Let's even the odds,
shall we, boys? Bottle up.

307
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:29,225
It's the Kahuna!

308
00:24:30,101 --> 00:24:32,001
I told you he's real.

309
00:24:53,358 --> 00:24:54,916
Oh, my God.

310
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,596
I love him!

311
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,329
It truly is the Kahuna.

312
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:49,204
- Who are you? What are you?
- No time for small talk.

313
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:54,375
- We gotta boogie, little lady.
- Boogie? Okay, but this is nuts.

314
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:11,764
Scan engine specs.
Mold ignition key.

315
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:15,839
<i>- Okay, what is going on?
- Key ready.</i>

316
00:26:16,007 --> 00:26:17,804
All right. Let's go.

317
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:21,241
Warning: Objects in mirror
are stupider than they appear.

318
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,244
Metal to the pedal.

319
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:26,407
Oops, forgot something.

320
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:28,279
No, I didn't.

321
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:30,680
See you.
Wouldn't wanna be you.

322
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:39,626
I will control the minds
of the children...

323
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:42,358
...through their own television sets.

324
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:47,233
A mind-control pulse will come
through Muggles the Frog.

325
00:26:47,405 --> 00:26:49,339
Muggles doesn't look like a frog.

326
00:26:49,507 --> 00:26:52,670
He looks like a zucchini.
This is irritating.

327
00:26:52,844 --> 00:26:54,641
As irritating as a...

328
00:26:57,082 --> 00:27:01,451
What is it, Crowe?
Good news, I hope?

329
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:06,582
The attempt to recover the disk...

330
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,755
It was unsuccessful.

331
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:14,558
This is not good news.

332
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:18,834
Where is the girl now?

333
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:21,165
- She escaped.
- Escaped?

334
00:27:22,707 --> 00:27:26,438
- You're not going to believe this.
- Try me.

335
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:30,939
My men report that
she was spirited away...

336
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:34,745
...by some sort of mini...
- Kahuna.

337
00:27:37,355 --> 00:27:39,414
Kahuna is here.

338
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:44,854
- Suddenly I'm feeling weak.
- Let's sit down.

339
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:48,198
- Sir.
- Get me something.

340
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:51,392
- What can I get you, sir?
- Soda pop.

341
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:53,799
- Diet or regular?
- What's the difference?

342
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:57,305
Feel my head. Is it hot?
Is it cold? Tell me the truth.

343
00:27:57,475 --> 00:27:59,841
- You're perfectly normal.
- Normal?

344
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,673
You're not a real doctor.
Where's my soda pop?

345
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:04,815
Get me my globe.

346
00:28:04,983 --> 00:28:09,147
I don't want this umbrella.
I'm a sick man.

347
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:19,730
Then you did a bunch of back flips,
then you waded in garbage cans...

348
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:23,800
...and you kicked them. Then you put
that garbage can on the guy's head.

349
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:28,405
And then you did karate moves.
And then you got them all tied up...

350
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:30,837
...and then you spun them
around a bunch.

351
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:36,037
Then that guy tried to hit you, and
he hit the other goon by accident.

352
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:39,672
Then you knocked them down
and ran up that wall like Spider-Man.

353
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:44,020
That was cool. You saved us.
And they were afraid of you.

354
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:48,523
Those goons were afraid of you.
You saved us.

355
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:52,925
We're related, you know. Part of the
Bobbins' World, along with my dad...

356
00:28:53,098 --> 00:28:58,035
...and my cousins Sly and Whit. I bet
I know why you're here. It's Biscane.

357
00:28:58,203 --> 00:29:00,603
- He's Kane.
- This has to be a dream.

358
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:03,434
Your archenemy, right? I knew it.

359
00:29:03,608 --> 00:29:06,839
What's it like to have super
strengths and super gadgets...?

360
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:09,809
Easy on the gummy bears.
The sugar's getting to you.

361
00:29:09,981 --> 00:29:12,575
It was Biscane's men
who tried to nab you.

362
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,652
My guess is, he's up to something
with Bobbins' World.

363
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:20,348
All right, everybody, you can
relax now. You're safe here.

364
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:33,700
Wow, this is totally off the hook.

365
00:29:36,574 --> 00:29:38,371
All aboard.

366
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:46,809
- This is your ride?
- Welcome to my playground.

367
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:49,249
Wow.

368
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:54,921
Amazing.

369
00:29:58,196 --> 00:30:03,600
- My God.
- This is one bad Batcave.

370
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:11,570
- Magnificent. A baby utopia.
- This place is the bomb.

371
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:15,406
It's my world of holograms. We can
create any dream you can dream.

372
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,047
Send in the clowns.

373
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:30,217
- Wow.
- What is this place?

374
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:34,260
- Wanna see my pets?
- Yeah. Cool.

375
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:47,369
- Oh, my God.
- Holograms make great watchdogs...

376
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:50,036
...and you don't have to feed them.

377
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:55,316
- Oh no, a bear. A bear.
- It's a bear.

378
00:30:55,486 --> 00:30:57,147
A bear!

379
00:31:05,129 --> 00:31:07,791
And now the king.

380
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:11,094
Now, is he on a chain?
Tell me he's on a chain.

381
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:23,211
Come on, Fink, sing with me.

382
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:33,350
- We're here.
- Wow.

383
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:40,896
We're here. I have
to see this. Okay, Finkie.

384
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:44,330
All ashore who's going ashore.

385
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:46,663
Watch your step, Alex.

386
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:49,136
- Off we go, Rosita.
- Kylie, me too.

387
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:51,775
- Come on, Arch.
- Hey, Archie, come over here.

388
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:54,605
- Wait for me.
- This is cool.

389
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:58,048
Go take a look around.
You won't believe what you see.

390
00:31:58,216 --> 00:32:00,707
How come you still understand
baby talk?

391
00:32:00,885 --> 00:32:02,113
I never forgot it.

392
00:32:03,554 --> 00:32:05,749
You guys go have fun.
I have work to do.

393
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,722
I imagine you do.

394
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:34,275
Hello, miss. Care to give the old
Imagination Station a go?

395
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:38,252
Inside of every child is the ability
to be anything you want.

396
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:41,290
Believe in yourself,
and the Imagination Station...

397
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:43,154
...will take care of the rest.

398
00:32:43,328 --> 00:32:45,387
Maybe another time.

399
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:47,564
But nice accent, Ringo.

400
00:32:47,732 --> 00:32:51,293
- We wanna try it.
- Yeah, can we do it? Can we go?

401
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:56,236
- We all wanna go, furry-hat man.
- This is a motley little group, isn't it?

402
00:32:56,407 --> 00:32:59,672
Hey, he's cool.
He talks baby.

403
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:03,541
The four of you, eh? Right.
Hop on in then.

404
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:06,548
And let your inner dreams soar.

405
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:09,243
Find the circles.
Stand on the circles.

406
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,217
In you go.

407
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:15,188
- Let's get this party going.
- Let's go, Ringo.

408
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,658
- Let's do it!
- Okay, boss.

409
00:33:19,864 --> 00:33:21,422
Where's my car seat?

410
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:24,363
Wait a minute, we ain't strapped in.

411
00:33:24,535 --> 00:33:26,628
We're gonna be launched into space!

412
00:33:26,804 --> 00:33:30,865
Kahuna, are you sure this is safe?

413
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:37,845
<i>Archie, your hidden strength
is the power of your mind.</i>

414
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:40,577
<i>You are Brain Boy.</i>

415
00:33:43,087 --> 00:33:46,853
<i>Quentin Finkleman, you have
more strength than you realize.</i>

416
00:33:49,093 --> 00:33:52,153
<i>You are Baby Courageous.</i>

417
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:57,568
<i>Rosita, as tough as you are,
you have a vast depth of love.</i>

418
00:33:57,735 --> 00:34:00,226
<i>You are Cupid Girl.</i>

419
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:05,508
<i>Alex, you are brimming
with energy and joy.</i>

420
00:34:05,676 --> 00:34:08,304
<i>You are Bouncing Boy.</i>

421
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:12,176
Yo, Kahuna, this thing's busted.

422
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:14,341
What are you talking about?

423
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:16,419
What do you mean, it's busted?

424
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:19,021
I'm not smart enough
to be Brain Boy.

425
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:22,819
And Finkleman sure isn't tough
enough to be Baby Courageous.

426
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:25,224
And hello, me, Cupid Girl?

427
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:27,421
That's okay.
I like bouncing.

428
00:34:27,598 --> 00:34:33,230
The only thing I love better than being
left alone is a good right hook.

429
00:34:34,505 --> 00:34:38,601
Maybe it is busted then. Or maybe
the machine's just seeing the real you.

430
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:40,608
Think about it.

431
00:34:40,778 --> 00:34:44,407
- All right, I'll change it back. Hang on.
- Okay.

432
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:50,885
<i>Strawberries and cream, madam?</i>

433
00:34:51,055 --> 00:34:54,218
<i>- Coffee and pie?
- Oh, my God.</i>

434
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:05,798
This place definitely rates a 10
on the weirdness scale.

435
00:35:11,642 --> 00:35:15,976
Milk shake? Banana split?
Anything to suit your fancy, ma'am.

436
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:22,152
<i>- Beat it!
- I say, tea and biscuits, madam?</i>

437
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:25,183
Shut up.
Don't open your mouth.

438
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:29,156
I don't wanna hear one word
out of that plastic face.

439
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:36,560
I was wrong. This makes 1000
on the weirdness scale.

440
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:42,400
- It does seem like that sometimes.
- Great, another ghost boy.

441
00:35:42,573 --> 00:35:45,007
I told you guys to beat it.

442
00:35:47,678 --> 00:35:50,875
- Oops, you're real.
- Yeah.

443
00:35:52,016 --> 00:35:53,643
I'm Zack.

444
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:56,218
I'm confused.

445
00:35:57,021 --> 00:35:58,784
Maybe I can help you here.

446
00:36:00,057 --> 00:36:02,457
You mean he designed
all this himself?

447
00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:07,587
You bet. And he's got places like this
in Switzerland, China and Argentina.

448
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:09,960
- He really is a superbaby.
- Super Kahuna.

449
00:36:10,134 --> 00:36:13,695
Have a little respect.
The man is over 7 years old.

450
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:19,969
And this is what we like to call
the Com Center.

451
00:36:20,144 --> 00:36:23,011
It's our global
communications system.

452
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:26,241
We can talk to anyone
in the world at any time.

453
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:29,250
Kylie, I see you've met Zack.

454
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:33,049
- What's that?
- 5:00. Time to check in. Watch this.

455
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:35,852
<i>- Hey, Whoops, it's me.
- Mr. K.</i>

456
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:39,155
<i>- Oh, finally.
- Sorry to be so long getting back...</i>

457
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:40,957
- Is that...?
- Yeah.

458
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:44,624
<i>I went to the graduation. Remember
the kids we got from Thailand?</i>

459
00:36:44,802 --> 00:36:46,201
<i>- Yeah.
- My goodness.</i>

460
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,167
<i>If you had seen their faces.</i>

461
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:51,331
<i>They're at Yale. They asked for you.
They love you.</i>

462
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:54,307
<i>So we'll talk again soon.
You'll call me this time?</i>

463
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:56,173
<i>- I promise.
- Thank you.</i>

464
00:36:56,347 --> 00:36:59,908
<i>- No problem. Hey, guys, what's up?
- Hey, guys, I got him. K.</i>

465
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:02,245
<i>- K!
- What's up, buddy?</i>

466
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:05,947
<i>We wanna let you know,
we checked out that situation for you.</i>

467
00:37:06,123 --> 00:37:10,685
<i>Yes, everything you said was right.
But the kids are 110 percent safe.</i>

468
00:37:10,861 --> 00:37:14,126
<i>- Great, guys.
- Scratches on the tricycle are minor.</i>

469
00:37:14,298 --> 00:37:15,492
<i>We'll fix those.</i>

470
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:19,227
<i>Tell him about the superhero theme
song we've been writing for you.</i>

471
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:21,871
<i>- Yeah!
- It's really good!</i>

472
00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:26,576
Cool.

473
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:33,350
<i>- That was great.
- Mr. K, that's all we have right now.</i>

474
00:37:33,517 --> 00:37:36,281
<i>Next time you call it'll be done,
I promise you.</i>

475
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:40,049
<i>- But for now, you're the greatest...
- We have the president on line.</i>

476
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:41,452
<i>- Later, K.
- Bye!</i>

477
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:45,062
- Oh, my gosh!
- Can you hold for a moment?

478
00:37:45,229 --> 00:37:46,856
- What is it?
- The time.

479
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:49,625
- My Uncle Stan's gonna freak out.
- Don't worry.

480
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,860
I'm sure he's handling it just fine.

481
00:37:53,037 --> 00:37:55,902
- I'm freaking out.
- Honey, I'm sure they'll be okay.

482
00:37:56,073 --> 00:37:59,338
What is Kylie thinking
taking the children out for so long?

483
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:01,808
Kylie's very responsible.

484
00:38:07,084 --> 00:38:08,949
Honey, hold this.

485
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,048
Yes?

486
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:14,248
<i>- Are you Stan Bobbins?
- Yes.</i>

487
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:17,223
I'm Capt. Baker
of the San Diego Police Department.

488
00:38:17,395 --> 00:38:22,128
We have your niece, your son,
and three other babies here.

489
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:25,131
Oh, my gosh.
Are they okay?

490
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,134
<i>They're fine. Everything's great.</i>

491
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:33,937
<i>- Well, what happened?
- Well, apparently they walked too far.</i>

492
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:38,104
Your niece attempted to get a bus,
but it was a one-way Greyhound...

493
00:38:38,282 --> 00:38:41,843
...and it couldn't stop
until they got to San Diego.

494
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:46,546
<i>- Hi, Uncle Stan, Aunt Jean.
- Hi, sweetie.</i>

495
00:38:46,724 --> 00:38:48,157
<i>I'll pick them up.</i>

496
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,620
<i>Negative, sir.
You'll never make it in time.</i>

497
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:54,856
<i>There's a two-tanker pileup
on the 405 Freeway.</i>

498
00:38:55,032 --> 00:38:57,159
<i>We'll put them up
in a hotel tonight.</i>

499
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,269
<i>Under police protection, of course.</i>

500
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:01,962
<i>And we'll get nannies
to look after the kids.</i>

501
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:05,965
<i>- Well, I don't know.
- No, no, no.</i>

502
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:07,770
We'll watch them like a hawk.

503
00:39:07,945 --> 00:39:09,810
I'll drive up in the morning.

504
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:13,006
It'll be great. It'll be fun,
like a slumber party.

505
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:15,718
What do you think?

506
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:20,650
At least we know they're safe.

507
00:39:20,825 --> 00:39:23,089
With traffic shut down,
we won't get there...

508
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,854
<i>...till the middle of the night.
- See you tomorrow.</i>

509
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,624
<i>Good luck on the big premiere,
Uncle Stan.</i>

510
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:32,291
Thanks, Kylie. Hey, and Kylie...

511
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:34,994
...I'm glad you're okay.

512
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:37,140
Bye, Archie. Bye, kids.

513
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:38,605
<i>- Big kisses.
- Bye, bye.</i>

514
00:39:38,776 --> 00:39:40,038
<i>Good night.</i>

515
00:39:41,779 --> 00:39:43,007
<i>Hi, Mommy. Hi, Daddy.</i>

516
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:44,679
Night-night.

517
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:46,976
Okay, we bought some time.
Now what?

518
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:50,587
I have to find out what Biscane
is up to with Bobbins' World.

519
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:53,246
And stop him before it's too late.

520
00:39:53,657 --> 00:39:57,491
I spent 30 million dollars
and 10 years of my life.

521
00:39:57,661 --> 00:40:01,529
So why is my most elaborate
and important operation...

522
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:03,599
...in danger of being brought down?

523
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:06,328
Because your men couldn't catch
a teenage girl?

524
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:08,472
- Yes.
- No!

525
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:11,608
- No.
- I know who is lurking behind this.

526
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,437
- Who?
- Kahuna.

527
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:15,943
That makes sense.

528
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,405
I hate this bit.

529
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,453
It's unbelievable.

530
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:35,258
Here I am on the threshold
of my ultimate dream...

531
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,833
...and as always,
Kahuna seeks to destroy it.

532
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:39,435
What shall we do?

533
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:47,901
Hey, Archie. Up here.

534
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:52,549
- Whoa, what are you doing up there?
- Relaxation, Arch.

535
00:40:52,716 --> 00:40:56,482
It's all about synchronizing the mind
and the body.

536
00:40:56,654 --> 00:41:00,715
Kahuna, where did you get
your powers?

537
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:06,121
Sorry, kid, it's just a story
I don't like to tell.

538
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:10,901
Listen, I like you, Archie.
You got guts.

539
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:13,901
In fact, you remind me of me
when I was a baby.

540
00:41:14,438 --> 00:41:17,066
- Really?
- Really.

541
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:21,438
Well, I'm gonna prove myself to you.
I'm gonna join your team.

542
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:23,876
And we can be real superheroes.

543
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:27,916
Before you take that path,
look at what you'd be leaving behind.

544
00:41:28,085 --> 00:41:31,282
- What, diaper rash?
- The love of your parents.

545
00:41:31,455 --> 00:41:34,015
I didn't have a choice, Arch.
You do.

546
00:41:37,194 --> 00:41:40,994
Come on, now. Time for you and your
baby buddies to get some shuteye.

547
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:43,656
Good night, Kahuna.

548
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:47,836
- Good night, Archie.
- Sweet dreams.

549
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:53,139
- We shall go forward as planned.
- As planned.

550
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:55,437
But, sir...

551
00:41:55,613 --> 00:41:58,707
...what about Kahuna and the disk?

552
00:41:58,883 --> 00:42:01,909
What about Kahuna and the disk?

553
00:42:03,254 --> 00:42:04,516
We get it back.

554
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,815
I have in my mind...

555
00:42:06,991 --> 00:42:10,188
...developing a little surprise
for Mr. Kahuna.

556
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:13,023
How do we find him?
We don't know his location.

557
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:15,062
We don't need to.

558
00:42:15,232 --> 00:42:20,226
- I make it so that he finds me.
- Bravo!

559
00:42:21,305 --> 00:42:23,466
So do you know baby language too?

560
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:26,701
I can't speak it well,
but I can understand a little bit.

561
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:29,175
How did you meet Kahuna?

562
00:42:29,346 --> 00:42:32,577
He found me in a Russian orphanage.
I was alone and scared.

563
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:35,412
My father died, and no one knew
where my mom was.

564
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:37,281
Why was he there?

565
00:42:37,454 --> 00:42:40,423
He was helping match up parents
with their lost kids.

566
00:42:40,591 --> 00:42:43,151
He tried but could never find
my mom.

567
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,189
That's when he took me in.

568
00:42:45,362 --> 00:42:47,626
Hey, Zack.

569
00:42:47,798 --> 00:42:50,858
How does Kahuna...?
You know.

570
00:42:51,035 --> 00:42:54,937
Help save the world, disarm bad guys,
drive turbo-powered baby buggies?

571
00:42:55,105 --> 00:42:58,370
- Yeah.
- It's quite a story.

572
00:42:58,542 --> 00:43:01,875
Parts I learned from Kahuna.
Some I found out on my own.

573
00:43:02,046 --> 00:43:05,243
Where the facts end
and the legend begins...

574
00:43:05,683 --> 00:43:07,947
...no one really knows for sure.

575
00:43:08,385 --> 00:43:10,683
You see, Kahuna's father
was a scientist.

576
00:43:10,854 --> 00:43:14,620
One of the best. He lived and worked
in a secret American Army base...

577
00:43:14,792 --> 00:43:17,124
<i>...in Germany
after the First World War.</i>

578
00:43:17,294 --> 00:43:21,424
<i>After he saw the horrible conditions
the soldiers suffered during the war...</i>

579
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:25,899
<i>...he dedicated his time to developing
a kind of super vitamin formula.</i>

580
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:28,436
<i>A formula to unlock the area
in the brain...</i>

581
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:31,040
<i>...that gives children
their amazing energy.</i>

582
00:43:31,508 --> 00:43:35,274
<i>The soldiers who lived in harsh
environments, with low food rations...</i>

583
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,778
<i>...would have a better chance
of survival.</i>

584
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:40,781
<i>But he created something
even more powerful.</i>

585
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:43,010
<i>A sort of fountain of youth formula...</i>

586
00:43:43,187 --> 00:43:45,621
<i>...which actually stopped
the aging process.</i>

587
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:47,780
<i>Because Kahuna's father
was widowed...</i>

588
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:51,724
<i>...he took his sons everywhere.
The babies competed for attention.</i>

589
00:43:51,895 --> 00:43:55,092
Shut up.
Stop crying, you little brat.

590
00:43:55,265 --> 00:43:56,732
Kenny...

591
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:59,266
...would you be nice
to your little brother?

592
00:43:59,436 --> 00:44:02,132
I've told you this before.

593
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:19,055
<i>Kahuna's father worried
that the enemy would realize...</i>

594
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:22,588
<i>...the potential of his formula
and use it for evil purposes.</i>

595
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:24,589
<i>And he was right.</i>

596
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:54,388
<i>Ten years later,
Kahuna was stronger...</i>

597
00:44:54,558 --> 00:44:56,958
<i>...smarter and faster
than anyone else.</i>

598
00:44:57,361 --> 00:45:00,296
<i>But he was stuck in the same
little body.</i>

599
00:45:00,597 --> 00:45:02,792
<i>He was like the Peter Pan of babies.</i>

600
00:45:19,083 --> 00:45:23,850
Hey, man, your brother gives
everybody the creeps. He's a freak.

601
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:39,864
Your brother is a regular
teenage boy. Just like you.

602
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:43,495
- You always stick up for him.
- His life is hard.

603
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:47,233
What happened wasn't
your brother's fault, it was mine.

604
00:45:48,846 --> 00:45:51,838
You think he's so smart.
Well, face it.

605
00:45:52,216 --> 00:45:55,583
He's a freak! I can't even relate
to this family.

606
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:58,051
I feel more German
than I am American.

607
00:45:58,455 --> 00:46:02,824
I should be with people
who appreciate a normal kid!

608
00:46:08,532 --> 00:46:13,333
<i>His father worked so hard to develop
an antidote for Kahuna's condition.</i>

609
00:46:14,204 --> 00:46:17,799
<i>But unfortunately,
he couldn't complete his work.</i>

610
00:46:34,057 --> 00:46:38,721
Take what you were given,
and make something good out of it.

611
00:46:38,896 --> 00:46:40,591
All right?

612
00:46:43,267 --> 00:46:46,430
You may forever have the body
of a child, you know.

613
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:50,001
But you'll always have the heart
of a hero.

614
00:47:05,789 --> 00:47:08,223
I love you, Daddy.

615
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,910
<i>Although he was now 18 years old...</i>

616
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:35,142
<i>...nobody believed it.</i>

617
00:47:43,093 --> 00:47:46,961
<i>After six months in the orphanage,
Kahuna realized his true destiny.</i>

618
00:47:47,931 --> 00:47:51,958
<i>He would find a way to help all
the orphans and children of the world.</i>

619
00:47:52,135 --> 00:47:55,468
<i>So in the dark of the night,
Kahuna slipped away.</i>

620
00:47:55,639 --> 00:47:57,903
<i>And a legend was born.</i>

621
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:01,605
- Wow.
- I'll say.

622
00:48:01,778 --> 00:48:04,338
What about the serum
he drinks from his bottle?

623
00:48:04,514 --> 00:48:07,915
The stuff that turns him
into a superbaby?

624
00:48:08,085 --> 00:48:11,953
It's a natural formula which interacts
with Kahuna's unique physiology.

625
00:48:12,122 --> 00:48:14,647
- Kahuna invented it himself.
- Why?

626
00:48:15,459 --> 00:48:18,986
He realized, long ago, that if
a 2 foot tall superhero...

627
00:48:19,162 --> 00:48:23,496
...were to become the defender of the
weak, he was gonna need an edge.

628
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:38,338
Now, the whole trick here
is just focus and visualize.

629
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:42,985
The only thing I can visualize
is me falling on my butt.

630
00:48:46,957 --> 00:48:50,017
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

631
00:48:56,233 --> 00:48:59,396
- What's this?
- Don't know. Does it have a label?

632
00:48:59,569 --> 00:49:01,594
I'm not sure.

633
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:04,707
It's got a microdot.
Where'd you get this?

634
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:08,971
Wait a second. When I bumped into
that Crowe guy, Biscane's flunky...

635
00:49:09,146 --> 00:49:11,774
...maybe it fell into the stroller.
- Maybe.

636
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:14,782
It could be something.
I'm gonna show it to Kahuna.

637
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:16,852
Good idea.

638
00:49:17,821 --> 00:49:21,313
Oh, by the way,
what are you doing later?

639
00:49:21,558 --> 00:49:23,753
I'm going home.

640
00:49:25,062 --> 00:49:28,498
Well, I just thought maybe, since
you're leaving after lunch...

641
00:49:28,665 --> 00:49:32,260
...that you and me, we could,
you know...

642
00:49:32,436 --> 00:49:35,269
...go have lunch up outside.
- Like a picnic.

643
00:49:35,439 --> 00:49:38,499
Totally. Yes, like a picnic.

644
00:49:39,276 --> 00:49:43,144
So 11:30 behind the H?

645
00:49:43,547 --> 00:49:47,449
- Yeah, definitely.
- Cool.

646
00:49:53,023 --> 00:49:55,287
I've got a date!

647
00:49:57,561 --> 00:50:00,462
Great. Got a date.

648
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:02,564
My hair.

649
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:06,826
At least I got a cool pair of shoes.

650
00:50:09,106 --> 00:50:12,974
I may not be much at this girlie stuff,
but I think I can help her out.

651
00:50:13,143 --> 00:50:16,476
I can help too. I'm very connected
to my feminine side.

652
00:50:16,646 --> 00:50:18,341
- Hi.
- Hey.

653
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:19,743
What?

654
00:50:19,916 --> 00:50:22,714
- What do you guys want?
- Come, Kylie.

655
00:50:22,886 --> 00:50:25,912
Okay, okay, okay.
I'm coming.

656
00:50:38,802 --> 00:50:41,100
Well, you wouldn't believe
the help I had.

657
00:50:41,738 --> 00:50:42,966
Total wow.

658
00:50:43,907 --> 00:50:47,468
- You come up here a lot?
- Yeah, I do.

659
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:50,711
Try to imagine what's going on
in each of the homes.

660
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:54,783
Do they have kids, are they being
tucked into bed for the night?

661
00:50:55,318 --> 00:50:58,185
You miss her?
Your mom, I mean.

662
00:50:58,355 --> 00:51:02,121
Well, don't get me wrong,
living with Kahuna's been great.

663
00:51:02,292 --> 00:51:05,125
I wouldn't give it up for anything
in the world.

664
00:51:05,295 --> 00:51:09,095
But, you know, I just wonder,
you know.

665
00:51:14,337 --> 00:51:16,066
What's that?

666
00:51:16,807 --> 00:51:20,368
If you don't know what a kiss is,
I must be doing this wrong.

667
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:24,068
- No, that.
- Oh, Kahuna.

668
00:51:25,048 --> 00:51:27,608
<i>Zack, the disk you and Kylie found?</i>

669
00:51:27,784 --> 00:51:29,513
<i>- The disk?
- Yeah.</i>

670
00:51:29,686 --> 00:51:32,883
<i>- Get down here right away.
- The disk. Let's go.</i>

671
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:42,764
- See anything strange?
- Besides a frog in a top hat?

672
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:45,731
I was talking about this.
Looks like scrambled data.

673
00:51:45,902 --> 00:51:49,269
- What is that?
- I think it's part of the puzzle.

674
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:52,931
Technically, this activates
a descrambler program.

675
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:55,544
Similar to the ones used
on TV cable boxes...

676
00:51:55,712 --> 00:51:58,704
...to receive premium channels.
- He is up to something.

677
00:51:58,882 --> 00:52:02,113
Whatever he's planning,
it's going down at Bobbins' World...

678
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:05,777
...in 30 minutes. I wanna be there.
- What about us?

679
00:52:06,156 --> 00:52:09,683
Oh, no. I'm feeling
nauseous again.

680
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:11,191
One day, Finkleman...

681
00:52:11,361 --> 00:52:14,125
...you'll find courage
where you least expect it.

682
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:18,393
Yeah. I was kind of hoping
I'd finally get to smack somebody.

683
00:52:18,602 --> 00:52:20,570
Suit up, Zack. We're going in.

684
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:29,338
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hey, Finkie.

685
00:52:29,513 --> 00:52:31,845
- Hey, Maria. How you doing?
- You okay?

686
00:52:32,015 --> 00:52:33,312
- You all right?
- Miss me?

687
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:35,713
- Auntie Jean.
- Hi.

688
00:52:36,453 --> 00:52:38,580
Hey, Kahuna, you forgot this.

689
00:52:38,755 --> 00:52:41,189
I didn't forget.
I want you to hold on to it.

690
00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:43,883
You'll understand why later.

691
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:46,392
- Take care, Arch.
- Wow.

692
00:52:47,297 --> 00:52:50,425
- I missed you.
- Hey, Archie.

693
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,534
- Uncle Stan.
- Yeah.

694
00:52:52,702 --> 00:52:54,761
Come on. The show's gonna start.

695
00:52:54,938 --> 00:52:57,406
Ladies and gentlemen,
the time has arrived.

696
00:52:57,574 --> 00:53:00,907
The master is here, the champion
of children everywhere.

697
00:53:01,077 --> 00:53:02,977
You know him, you love him.

698
00:53:03,146 --> 00:53:05,774
Mr. Bill Biscane.

699
00:53:05,949 --> 00:53:09,976
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
The spectacle is at hand.

700
00:53:10,153 --> 00:53:13,953
I'll let you all know when there is
just 60 seconds left.

701
00:53:14,124 --> 00:53:16,149
Kahuna is here.

702
00:53:16,326 --> 00:53:20,592
And I guarantee, this will change
the way you think...

703
00:53:20,764 --> 00:53:23,289
...about television, that is.

704
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:32,539
<i>Zack, direct your helmet camera
towards the satellite dish.</i>

705
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:33,937
<i>Towards the dish.</i>

706
00:53:35,779 --> 00:53:37,269
Hold it there, Zack.

707
00:53:37,447 --> 00:53:41,508
That box is giving enough
power to light up Times Square.

708
00:53:41,851 --> 00:53:43,284
Find anything?

709
00:53:43,453 --> 00:53:45,887
- Yeah, I think so.
- Okay, cool.

710
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:48,650
Are we ready?
Let's count it down.

711
00:53:48,825 --> 00:53:50,793
Fifty-six now.

712
00:53:50,961 --> 00:53:54,124
Fifty-five. Fifty-four.

713
00:53:54,297 --> 00:53:58,961
If this man wants to conquer the world,
what better way than television?

714
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:03,302
That's it.

715
00:54:03,473 --> 00:54:05,668
Zack, I think I figured it out.

716
00:54:05,842 --> 00:54:08,037
There's code hidden
in his transmissions.

717
00:54:08,211 --> 00:54:12,511
I think it'll be used to broadcast
the mind-altering signal to the kids.

718
00:54:12,716 --> 00:54:14,911
If anything happens, look inside.

719
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:17,053
- Forty-one.
- Okay, kid.

720
00:54:20,223 --> 00:54:23,317
Thirty-four. Thirty-three.

721
00:54:23,493 --> 00:54:27,554
Thirty-two. Thirty-one.

722
00:54:41,011 --> 00:54:43,844
Engage. Lift off.

723
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:47,948
Twenty-six. Twenty-five.

724
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:50,780
Twenty-four. Twenty-three.

725
00:54:53,757 --> 00:54:56,954
Eighteen. Seventeen.

726
00:54:57,227 --> 00:54:59,491
Sixteen. Fifteen.

727
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:11,197
Three. Two. One.

728
00:55:16,413 --> 00:55:20,110
Look! There's Muggles!

729
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:42,938
Hello, Kahuna.
I'm so happy to see you again.

730
00:55:51,948 --> 00:55:54,041
I can't see. I can't see.

731
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:03,091
- Where's Kahuna?
- He's vanished.

732
00:56:03,493 --> 00:56:05,518
It's all right, ladies and gentlemen.

733
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:07,663
After the spots clear...

734
00:56:07,831 --> 00:56:11,392
...you'll realize it's just a special effect.
A hologram.

735
00:56:11,568 --> 00:56:15,197
There was no real child.
There was no helicopter.

736
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:18,967
It was all just for your entertainment.
You having fun?

737
00:56:21,945 --> 00:56:23,845
Get out of the way, kids!

738
00:56:32,455 --> 00:56:33,717
I'm all right.

739
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:35,858
Vandals! Security!

740
00:56:36,025 --> 00:56:39,017
Vandals! Security!

741
00:56:39,195 --> 00:56:41,459
Just in time. Arrest that man.

742
00:56:41,631 --> 00:56:43,223
Whoa, hey.
What are you doing?

743
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:47,803
Arresting you, officer. We'll start with
destruction of private property.

744
00:56:47,971 --> 00:56:49,438
- We can explain.
- I hope so.

745
00:56:49,606 --> 00:56:51,369
- What's going on?
- It's Biscane.

746
00:56:51,541 --> 00:56:54,009
There's some mind-control thing
on the show.

747
00:56:54,177 --> 00:56:58,637
Next thing you know, she'll be saying
that babies have a secret language.

748
00:56:58,882 --> 00:57:01,407
But they do speak
a secret language.

749
00:57:02,352 --> 00:57:03,341
Get my coat.

750
00:57:03,653 --> 00:57:07,384
The babies stumbled on to something.
So Kane destroyed Kahuna.

751
00:57:07,557 --> 00:57:12,051
We will clean all this up and resume
the premiere at 6:00 sharp.

752
00:57:12,228 --> 00:57:16,426
In the meantime,
enjoy the refreshments.

753
00:57:17,667 --> 00:57:20,227
- Wanna press charges?
- No need to press charges.

754
00:57:20,403 --> 00:57:24,032
You see, I am a generous
and loving person.

755
00:57:24,207 --> 00:57:30,112
You're a real bad, bad, bad, bad man.

756
00:57:31,181 --> 00:57:35,618
I may not understand your language,
but I know what you're thinking.

757
00:57:35,785 --> 00:57:39,721
Stay out of my way runt,
or else.

758
00:57:45,361 --> 00:57:48,990
Will someone retrieve
this unfortunate child?

759
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:52,731
Coat.

760
00:57:58,041 --> 00:58:01,033
He wouldn't just leave us.
He's out there somewhere.

761
00:58:01,211 --> 00:58:03,236
He'll come back
when we need him.

762
00:58:03,413 --> 00:58:05,813
What are we going to do without him?

763
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:08,075
Don't worry. He'll be back.

764
00:58:08,251 --> 00:58:10,549
I'll worry if I wanna worry.

765
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:14,884
There's never gonna be anyone
like him. So brave, so powerful.

766
00:58:15,091 --> 00:58:16,422
- So tough.
- Oh, man.

767
00:58:16,593 --> 00:58:19,323
He was indeed one in a million.

768
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:23,091
- To the 14th power.
- I miss Kahuna.

769
00:58:23,266 --> 00:58:26,030
And who's gonna save the children
from Biscane now?

770
00:58:26,202 --> 00:58:29,262
- Yeah.
- Well, it's your world now, Archie.

771
00:58:29,439 --> 00:58:32,602
You know what?
I'm just a baby.

772
00:58:32,775 --> 00:58:37,303
A whiny, drooling diaper jockey.

773
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:41,275
I don't have the brains to come up
with some super plan...

774
00:58:41,618 --> 00:58:42,915
...like Kahuna.

775
00:58:43,086 --> 00:58:46,681
I can kick some diaper,
but I'm no Kahuna.

776
00:58:49,092 --> 00:58:50,957
Kahuna.

777
00:58:57,767 --> 00:59:01,567
<i>Hey, kids, if you're watching
this right now, things can't be good.</i>

778
00:59:01,738 --> 00:59:03,865
<i>It means something has happened
to me...</i>

779
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:08,340
<i>...and the children of the world
are quite possibly in grave danger.</i>

780
00:59:08,511 --> 00:59:11,969
<i>I can't tell you what to do next,
but I can say this:</i>

781
00:59:12,148 --> 00:59:16,107
<i>Archie, you believed there was
a Kahuna when nobody else would.</i>

782
00:59:16,286 --> 00:59:20,347
<i>Now I'm asking all of you
to take a leap of faith...</i>

783
00:59:20,523 --> 00:59:24,721
<i>...and believe in something even
more powerful than a superbaby.</i>

784
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:28,557
<i>- What's more powerful than that?
- Yourselves.</i>

785
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:33,532
<i>Every child has power.
All you have to do is believe.</i>

786
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:37,536
<i>All right, guys, I guess
that's all there is to say.</i>

787
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:40,501
<i>Whatever you decide...</i>

788
00:59:40,677 --> 00:59:42,542
<i>...good luck.</i>

789
00:59:43,313 --> 00:59:46,510
Playtime is over.
Kahuna's right.

790
00:59:46,683 --> 00:59:48,913
We've gotta start believing
in ourselves.

791
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:51,178
We're not just babies anymore.

792
00:59:51,454 --> 00:59:53,422
We can be heroes.

793
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:55,956
- I'm down.
- Come on, Rosita.

794
00:59:56,125 --> 00:59:59,026
You have more power than 10 boys
put together.

795
00:59:59,195 --> 01:00:02,028
You got that right. I'm in.

796
01:00:02,198 --> 01:00:05,861
Finkleman, we can't do it without you.

797
01:00:06,035 --> 01:00:08,595
Put your hand on the rattle
or deal with Rosita.

798
01:00:08,838 --> 01:00:10,772
We've gotta work together
as a team.

799
01:00:11,374 --> 01:00:12,602
What do you say?

800
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:17,075
K for Kahuna!

801
01:00:19,582 --> 01:00:24,178
<i>Kahuna, Kahuna, Kahuna.</i>

802
01:00:42,605 --> 01:00:45,665
So how does it feel to be in chains?

803
01:00:45,842 --> 01:00:47,867
I designed them myself, by the way.

804
01:00:48,044 --> 01:00:49,875
From a titanium alloy.

805
01:00:50,046 --> 01:00:52,879
You've got way too much time
on your hands, Kane.

806
01:00:53,049 --> 01:00:56,485
I bet you don't know how
we did our disappearing act.

807
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:58,314
You altered the decoder box...

808
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:01,457
...to reflect my laser beam
right back at me.

809
01:01:02,125 --> 01:01:05,253
You snatched me while everybody
was seeing stars.

810
01:01:05,428 --> 01:01:07,692
And you played right into it.

811
01:01:07,964 --> 01:01:10,865
Anyway, I foiled your plot
to brainwash those babies.

812
01:01:11,034 --> 01:01:14,435
You think that was my plot?
That's always been your problem.

813
01:01:14,604 --> 01:01:17,835
You are small, so you think small.

814
01:01:18,174 --> 01:01:21,143
Why should I waste my time
with bedwetting babies...

815
01:01:21,310 --> 01:01:24,677
...when I can control the minds
of the entire world?

816
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:26,781
In just a few hours...

817
01:01:26,949 --> 01:01:30,680
...all worldwide TV networks...

818
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:34,516
...will be switching from their satellites
to my state-of-the-art...

819
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:37,717
...Telespace 3000.
- So it's a mind-control pulse.

820
01:01:37,894 --> 01:01:41,694
Millions of couch potatoes
will fill their minds...

821
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:45,732
...with nothing but the needs
of Bill Biscane.

822
01:01:45,902 --> 01:01:49,360
Buying Biscane products, watching
the Biscane satellite network.

823
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:52,474
Investing their life savings
in Biscane stocks.

824
01:01:52,642 --> 01:01:54,872
All Biscane, all the time.

825
01:01:55,044 --> 01:01:56,671
So it's true what they say.

826
01:01:56,846 --> 01:01:59,280
There is nothing but junk
on television.

827
01:01:59,582 --> 01:02:03,609
You're just jealous because
I'm winning this time. Me, me, me.

828
01:02:03,786 --> 01:02:07,222
- He's always pulling me down!
- I know. He's a bully, sir.

829
01:02:07,824 --> 01:02:09,815
This isn't over.

830
01:02:10,193 --> 01:02:13,185
It will be at 6:00.

831
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:16,990
Enjoy your stay
at my little child-care center.

832
01:02:17,166 --> 01:02:20,135
I created it especially for you.
Take him away.

833
01:02:26,642 --> 01:02:27,973
Is he gone?

834
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:53,432
Who's your decorator, Spider-Man?

835
01:02:53,803 --> 01:02:55,634
Search him.

836
01:03:15,158 --> 01:03:19,720
What can I tell you?
Little boys like their toys.

837
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:34,408
I'll take a 10 a. m. wake-up call.

838
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:50,720
<i>Good night, sweet prince.</i>

839
01:03:58,801 --> 01:04:01,269
Is that your secret with children, Dan?

840
01:04:01,437 --> 01:04:05,237
Did you actually communicate
with the babies just like you said?

841
01:04:05,408 --> 01:04:07,968
The babies are missing again.

842
01:04:09,178 --> 01:04:12,875
- What is going on around here?
- I don't know.

843
01:04:16,052 --> 01:04:18,680
- Did you see that?
- See what?

844
01:04:19,722 --> 01:04:21,986
You're not gonna believe this.

845
01:04:25,661 --> 01:04:30,621
- Hey, Archie, I got the keys.
- Nice work, Alex.

846
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:33,928
Okay, team, here we go.

847
01:04:35,004 --> 01:04:36,471
- Archie!
- What on earth...

848
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:38,869
...do you kids think you're doing?

849
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:42,033
I have the Finklemans and Haley's
mom ready to sue me...

850
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:45,612
...over your first disappearing act.
Now it's Grand Theft Auto?

851
01:04:45,781 --> 01:04:47,408
It's not that simple.

852
01:04:48,417 --> 01:04:50,578
Before you say anything, just listen.

853
01:04:50,753 --> 01:04:53,654
I tried to tell you before,
but you didn't believe me.

854
01:04:53,823 --> 01:04:57,520
Bill Biscane is not the man
you think he is.

855
01:04:57,693 --> 01:05:02,289
He does have a mind-control pulse
that he tried to use on the babies.

856
01:05:02,765 --> 01:05:05,996
Sometimes you need to trust
your heart instead of your head.

857
01:05:06,168 --> 01:05:08,295
- Kylie's cool.
- I really need your help.

858
01:05:08,471 --> 01:05:11,133
The babies need your help.
Kahuna needs your help.

859
01:05:11,307 --> 01:05:14,743
- We can't do it without you.
- What's a Kahuna?

860
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:18,369
Hey, Garbot, over here.
Over here. Over here.

861
01:05:18,547 --> 01:05:19,878
Activate laser scan.

862
01:05:20,683 --> 01:05:22,674
<i>I am active.</i>

863
01:05:56,052 --> 01:05:59,212
Lots of people talked
about world domination.

864
01:05:59,388 --> 01:06:01,549
Caesar. Napoleon.

865
01:06:01,724 --> 01:06:03,282
Darth Vader.

866
01:06:03,459 --> 01:06:07,395
Darth Vader. But nobody's
really pulled it off.

867
01:06:08,164 --> 01:06:09,722
Until now.

868
01:06:09,899 --> 01:06:13,027
You truly are a great visionary.

869
01:06:13,436 --> 01:06:16,496
Sir, we're ready to initiate
the universal uplink switch.

870
01:06:16,672 --> 01:06:18,299
I'll take that off your hands.

871
01:06:22,745 --> 01:06:24,610
Don't bother.
I'll show myself out.

872
01:06:25,014 --> 01:06:27,448
<i>Hasta la vista, baby.</i>

873
01:06:28,184 --> 01:06:30,550
Get him!
Get him!

874
01:06:40,429 --> 01:06:41,760
- Where?
- There.

875
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:48,097
All right, wise guy, how you
gonna get off this roof now?

876
01:07:29,945 --> 01:07:31,503
Keep your eye on the radar.

877
01:07:40,623 --> 01:07:44,320
How many people are in this car?
We couldn't get another vehicle?

878
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:02,973
Zack? Zack?

879
01:08:05,614 --> 01:08:09,414
- Holy...
- My thoughts exactly.

880
01:08:09,985 --> 01:08:11,680
Zack.

881
01:08:11,887 --> 01:08:15,550
- Hey, what are you doing here?
- The question is, what are you doing?

882
01:08:15,724 --> 01:08:17,885
- What's wrong?
- The satellite receiver...

883
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:20,858
...is detecting a vehicle
moving this way.

884
01:08:21,030 --> 01:08:24,227
<i>That's me, Zack. I'm coming in.
We got visitors.</i>

885
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:27,995
This Kahuna guy must be super.
Would you look at this place?

886
01:08:28,170 --> 01:08:30,434
You guys spent the night here?

887
01:08:30,606 --> 01:08:32,506
Mr. And Mrs. Bobbins?

888
01:08:32,675 --> 01:08:36,577
Hi. You guys might wanna get ready.
We're about to have company.

889
01:08:36,745 --> 01:08:39,213
Followed by a small army
of Biscane's men...

890
01:08:39,381 --> 01:08:42,009
I think I've got a way
to even the odds.

891
01:08:42,184 --> 01:08:44,015
Come on, guys. Come with me.

892
01:08:44,186 --> 01:08:46,814
Let's get into the Imagination Station.

893
01:08:46,989 --> 01:08:49,514
We can become our superselves
and help Kahuna.

894
01:08:49,692 --> 01:08:52,422
- Hello? We're outnumbered.
- And we're outsized.

895
01:08:52,595 --> 01:08:54,290
Remember, you have to believe.

896
01:08:54,463 --> 01:08:58,126
Believe you can do anything you set
your minds and hearts out to do.

897
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:01,701
Oh, no. I'm getting nauseous again.

898
01:09:26,462 --> 01:09:28,555
Right this way.

899
01:09:32,902 --> 01:09:35,564
Right this way.
Is anyone listening to me?

900
01:09:36,071 --> 01:09:37,663
He's here.

901
01:09:38,307 --> 01:09:41,299
He's right here.
Right in this doorway.

902
01:09:43,379 --> 01:09:47,907
He's here. He's here. We found it.
Prepare all units for a beach landing.

903
01:09:48,083 --> 01:09:50,551
- Prepare units for a landing.
- Single file.

904
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:52,084
Single file.

905
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:54,754
So, Kahuna...

906
01:09:56,458 --> 01:09:59,757
This is déjà vu all over again.

907
01:10:02,298 --> 01:10:05,995
- I can't let you win.
- You have no choice. You see?

908
01:10:06,168 --> 01:10:10,468
I have my crack troops with me.
Look. And reinforcements.

909
01:10:10,639 --> 01:10:15,269
You haven't got a snowball's chance.
This is it for you. It's over.

910
01:10:15,678 --> 01:10:17,407
Nice spot.

911
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:22,244
A little candy cane for my taste,
but then, I am an adult.

912
01:10:23,419 --> 01:10:26,877
I... I am even a little sad
that this must end.

913
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:30,287
You have been a formidable opponent.

914
01:10:30,659 --> 01:10:32,957
Congratulations.

915
01:10:33,729 --> 01:10:37,130
But this time, I am too many
and too powerful.

916
01:10:37,299 --> 01:10:39,028
And as always...

917
01:10:39,201 --> 01:10:40,691
...you are all alone.

918
01:10:40,869 --> 01:10:44,270
- Kahuna is not alone.
- Kahuna is not alone.

919
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:46,499
- One of your little tricks?
- Not alone.

920
01:10:46,675 --> 01:10:48,302
- Not alone.
- Not alone.

921
01:10:48,477 --> 01:10:50,377
- Not alone.
- Who is this...

922
01:10:50,546 --> 01:10:53,208
...that stands with Kahuna
against Bill Biscane?

923
01:10:57,753 --> 01:11:01,086
- It's me.
- And me.

924
01:11:02,424 --> 01:11:06,087
<i>And me.
A History of the Diaper Wars.</i>

925
01:11:07,296 --> 01:11:08,558
Hey.

926
01:11:09,064 --> 01:11:10,361
Me too.

927
01:11:12,167 --> 01:11:14,158
- And me.
- And me.

928
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:16,162
And us.

929
01:11:17,539 --> 01:11:19,131
All right, team!

930
01:11:20,476 --> 01:11:23,673
Well, as Genghis Khan once said:

931
01:11:23,846 --> 01:11:26,610
"The more the merrier. "
I want the disk!

932
01:11:26,782 --> 01:11:29,250
You want it? Come and get it.

933
01:11:30,486 --> 01:11:33,046
- I got it!
- Charge! Take no prisoners!

934
01:11:33,222 --> 01:11:34,519
Now I'm excited.

935
01:11:34,690 --> 01:11:37,386
All right, superbabies,
let's see what you can do.

936
01:11:41,797 --> 01:11:43,594
It's my turn!

937
01:11:46,335 --> 01:11:48,565
Why not freshen up a little?

938
01:11:50,072 --> 01:11:52,597
All right, Fink!
Major power move!

939
01:11:52,775 --> 01:11:56,575
Come on, get them!
You are big soldiers. Do something!

940
01:11:57,913 --> 01:12:00,074
There it is. Get the disk!

941
01:12:00,249 --> 01:12:01,978
- Open your eyes.
- It's mine!

942
01:12:04,119 --> 01:12:05,108
It's mine!

943
01:12:09,525 --> 01:12:11,789
There it is! That's it! Get it, get it!

944
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:14,224
Boost me up! Boost me up!

945
01:12:15,497 --> 01:12:18,796
You know, the old me would have
knocked you boys senseless...

946
01:12:18,967 --> 01:12:22,733
...with a right hook. But Cupid Girl
would rather spread the love.

947
01:12:25,574 --> 01:12:26,563
Got you.

948
01:12:26,742 --> 01:12:30,234
You can run, but you can't
hide from Cupid Girl.

949
01:12:31,914 --> 01:12:33,313
I love you, man.

950
01:12:33,482 --> 01:12:36,383
- Give me a hug, you big lug.
- Oh, no.

951
01:12:36,552 --> 01:12:39,953
This is the worst news yet. Come on.

952
01:12:40,122 --> 01:12:43,091
- Okay, Rosita!
- Come on, they are babies!

953
01:12:43,258 --> 01:12:44,418
Get them, get them!

954
01:12:44,593 --> 01:12:46,959
Come on, they're babies.
Get them, get them!

955
01:12:47,129 --> 01:12:49,256
You don't have
to say everything I say.

956
01:12:49,431 --> 01:12:52,161
You don't have
to say everything I say.

957
01:12:53,535 --> 01:12:54,968
Yes!

958
01:12:56,105 --> 01:12:59,802
- I got it!
- I got it! I got it!

959
01:13:06,382 --> 01:13:08,350
Nobody messes with my son.

960
01:13:10,018 --> 01:13:11,883
- That's it! This is the idea!
- Hey!

961
01:13:12,054 --> 01:13:13,612
- That's my husband.
- So?

962
01:13:18,761 --> 01:13:21,924
- Right in the forbidden zone.
- Oh, honey.

963
01:13:22,097 --> 01:13:25,464
- Honey, are you okay?
- That hurt a lot.

964
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:32,700
- That disk belongs to me, girlie.
- Who you calling girlie, sister?

965
01:13:39,148 --> 01:13:42,549
- Alex!
- What's happening?

966
01:13:42,718 --> 01:13:48,315
Get that one. And that one.
And that one. And that one.

967
01:13:48,490 --> 01:13:50,355
- Do it!
- You bet.

968
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:11,804
- Can a brother get some water?
- Alex, you're sweating.

969
01:14:12,047 --> 01:14:13,742
Here.

970
01:14:15,050 --> 01:14:19,419
Must find the communication center.
We're losing time, precious time.

971
01:14:19,588 --> 01:14:21,886
That looks like
the communication center.

972
01:14:22,057 --> 01:14:24,025
Thanks, Kahuna.

973
01:14:27,396 --> 01:14:28,954
Get back to work.

974
01:14:38,841 --> 01:14:41,810
That should keep them
sleeping for a while.

975
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:47,574
Got you.

976
01:14:47,916 --> 01:14:51,716
All right, Brain Boy.
You figured it out, huh, Brain Boy?

977
01:14:51,887 --> 01:14:54,685
- Yeah.
- Give me five, Arch.

978
01:14:56,625 --> 01:14:58,889
You stay here. No one must pass.

979
01:14:59,061 --> 01:15:00,153
- Right.
- No one.

980
01:15:00,429 --> 01:15:02,590
Alex, you were great.

981
01:15:02,931 --> 01:15:05,525
All right, honey.
Archie, come over here!

982
01:15:07,569 --> 01:15:08,860
We did it!

983
01:15:09,037 --> 01:15:10,265
Tascha. Tascha.

984
01:15:10,439 --> 01:15:12,464
Wake up. Wake up.

985
01:15:13,742 --> 01:15:16,176
It's me. Up here.
Billy. Bill Biscane.

986
01:15:16,345 --> 01:15:18,939
The disk. Throw it up here.

987
01:15:19,147 --> 01:15:21,547
Come to papa. Come.

988
01:15:33,161 --> 01:15:34,321
The disk!

989
01:15:44,673 --> 01:15:46,834
I did it! I did it! I did it!

990
01:15:47,776 --> 01:15:50,370
It's too late. It's too late.

991
01:15:51,046 --> 01:15:53,640
Thanks to the power
of your own uplink...

992
01:15:53,815 --> 01:15:55,976
...I can bounce
the mind-control pulse...

993
01:15:56,151 --> 01:15:59,416
...off the satellite right from here.
It's so convenient.

994
01:15:59,588 --> 01:16:02,148
If I didn't hate you so much,
I would thank you.

995
01:16:02,324 --> 01:16:04,451
What happened back then
wasn't my fault.

996
01:16:04,626 --> 01:16:08,084
- You don't have to keep hating me.
- Don't flatter yourself.

997
01:16:08,263 --> 01:16:11,494
You think I went to all this trouble
because Dad liked you best?

998
01:16:11,667 --> 01:16:13,897
- "Dad"?
- What are you talking about?

999
01:16:14,069 --> 01:16:18,563
Gee whiz, your little band of merry
diaper men haven't figured it out yet?

1000
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:21,903
Biscane here is Ken, my brother.

1001
01:16:48,870 --> 01:16:53,705
I should have been the one
to get the superhero powers.

1002
01:16:55,877 --> 01:16:59,540
I should have stayed young forever.
You took all that from me.

1003
01:16:59,715 --> 01:17:02,081
- It's over.
- You're wrong.

1004
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:04,411
There's no fail-safe.

1005
01:17:04,786 --> 01:17:08,722
And this program will transmit
a mind-control pulse no matter what.

1006
01:17:08,890 --> 01:17:13,520
The satellite can't be shut down,
blown up or knocked off course.

1007
01:17:13,695 --> 01:17:17,187
Ken, one. Kahuna, zip.

1008
01:17:17,366 --> 01:17:21,803
How does it feel, after all these years,
to be the one that is defeated?

1009
01:17:21,970 --> 01:17:25,235
- How does it feel? Tell me.
- It feels bad.

1010
01:17:25,407 --> 01:17:28,501
Yeah, it feels bad. Feels really lousy,
doesn't it? Good.

1011
01:17:28,677 --> 01:17:31,373
There. Now, was that so hard?

1012
01:17:31,546 --> 01:17:34,106
There's still one trick
you haven't learned yet.

1013
01:17:34,282 --> 01:17:35,374
Really?

1014
01:17:35,550 --> 01:17:38,485
I'm about to become the most
powerful man in the world.

1015
01:17:38,654 --> 01:17:41,418
Enlighten me.
What is it I have to learn?

1016
01:17:41,590 --> 01:17:42,989
How to make friends.

1017
01:17:43,158 --> 01:17:45,285
- Kids, now!
- Go, go!

1018
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:47,121
- Okay, kids.
- Come on, kids!

1019
01:17:47,295 --> 01:17:49,820
Go, go! Come on, let's go get him.

1020
01:17:50,565 --> 01:17:51,827
No bodily harm.

1021
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,366
Move, move! Move, move!

1022
01:17:57,506 --> 01:18:01,567
- That's it! No bodily...
- One, two, three, four, five.

1023
01:18:01,743 --> 01:18:03,904
Bye-bye, Biscane. You're walking.

1024
01:18:04,079 --> 01:18:08,345
- Good Biscane ball bashing, Alex.
- Options. I need them quick.

1025
01:18:08,517 --> 01:18:10,610
We can't abort the satellite feed.

1026
01:18:10,786 --> 01:18:13,084
- There's no way to stop him?
- Hey, Kahuna.

1027
01:18:13,255 --> 01:18:15,018
- I've got the answer.
- Well?

1028
01:18:15,190 --> 01:18:18,921
- Every day we get storytime.
- Now's not a good time for baby talk.

1029
01:18:19,094 --> 01:18:22,154
I think I know what he's getting at.
Go on, Archie.

1030
01:18:22,330 --> 01:18:24,525
Every day we have storytime.

1031
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:28,602
It can be either a bad book
or a good book.

1032
01:18:28,770 --> 01:18:30,761
And we can't stop storytime.

1033
01:18:30,939 --> 01:18:35,000
But we can change the story
from a bad one to a good one.

1034
01:18:35,177 --> 01:18:37,168
I can alter the mind-control message.

1035
01:18:37,345 --> 01:18:40,974
Instead of being robbed of their
free will, we just turn it around.

1036
01:18:41,149 --> 01:18:43,515
And crank up the free will.

1037
01:18:43,685 --> 01:18:45,209
No. No, no!

1038
01:18:45,387 --> 01:18:47,514
No, you'll ruin everything.

1039
01:18:47,823 --> 01:18:50,656
Switch the mind-control message
to freedom control.

1040
01:18:50,826 --> 01:18:53,226
They don't have to sit
and watch TV all day.

1041
01:18:53,395 --> 01:18:55,863
- Will it work?
- There's one way to find out.

1042
01:18:56,031 --> 01:18:59,000
All right, Archie, hit the switch.
Now.

1043
01:19:02,137 --> 01:19:04,367
What're we watching
this lame frog for?

1044
01:19:04,539 --> 01:19:05,631
He's boring.

1045
01:19:05,807 --> 01:19:09,368
- Let's go outside and play.
- Okay. Let's play tag. You're it.

1046
01:19:12,147 --> 01:19:13,375
We got it!

1047
01:19:15,550 --> 01:19:18,144
Way to go, kids!

1048
01:19:18,353 --> 01:19:22,050
I may have lost the battle,
but I will win the war.

1049
01:19:22,224 --> 01:19:23,782
I'll get this one!

1050
01:19:23,959 --> 01:19:25,051
Not so fast, Billy.

1051
01:19:27,829 --> 01:19:31,128
- That was pretty good.
- Thank you.

1052
01:19:33,101 --> 01:19:34,762
That's my bad leg.

1053
01:19:39,374 --> 01:19:40,568
Oh, my God.

1054
01:19:45,447 --> 01:19:48,746
"To realize the power
of your true self, press this button. "

1055
01:19:49,384 --> 01:19:52,376
This is how they became
their superselves. It's time...

1056
01:19:52,554 --> 01:19:55,614
...for the real me to emerge.

1057
01:19:56,191 --> 01:19:57,658
Here I come!

1058
01:20:09,070 --> 01:20:10,901
Oh, no.

1059
01:20:11,072 --> 01:20:14,564
I hate babies.

1060
01:20:14,743 --> 01:20:18,110
- I hated being a baby.
- Don't you worry, little Billy.

1061
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:20,305
I'll feed you.
I'll take care of you.

1062
01:20:20,482 --> 01:20:22,109
I'll even change your diaper.

1063
01:20:22,284 --> 01:20:24,047
I'm warning you, Crowe.

1064
01:20:24,219 --> 01:20:27,416
I'm Bill Biscane. If you touch
my diapers, you're fired.

1065
01:20:27,589 --> 01:20:31,582
- Oh, you dear boy.
- Put me down. I can drool by myself.

1066
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:33,057
Put me down.

1067
01:20:33,228 --> 01:20:36,925
This has gotta be the most
amazing day in history.

1068
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:40,396
And you have a lot
of explaining to do.

1069
01:20:40,569 --> 01:20:43,197
- Well, where do I start?
- From the beginning.

1070
01:20:43,371 --> 01:20:44,736
You wanna hear the story?

1071
01:20:44,906 --> 01:20:48,307
Okay, guys. It's time for me
to pack up and move on.

1072
01:20:48,476 --> 01:20:51,536
Maybe someday we could beat
some bad guys up together...

1073
01:20:51,713 --> 01:20:54,307
...and then we'd get
a chocolate shake after.

1074
01:20:54,482 --> 01:20:58,111
Deep down we both know, kids,
if that stroller leaves from here...

1075
01:20:58,286 --> 01:21:02,086
...and you're not on it, you'll regret it.
Maybe not today...

1076
01:21:02,257 --> 01:21:06,057
...maybe not tomorrow, but soon,
and for the rest of your lives.

1077
01:21:06,895 --> 01:21:08,760
You don't have to leave.

1078
01:21:10,232 --> 01:21:14,225
You don't have to go away.
You can come live with us.

1079
01:21:14,402 --> 01:21:16,302
You know I can't do that.

1080
01:21:16,471 --> 01:21:18,905
- Why not?
- Kid...

1081
01:21:19,074 --> 01:21:23,602
I wanna work side by side
with my best friend, Kahuna.

1082
01:21:23,778 --> 01:21:26,212
We'll always be friends.

1083
01:21:26,381 --> 01:21:28,781
Wait a second.
None of this is making sense.

1084
01:21:28,950 --> 01:21:30,281
- Go back...
- Wait a minute.

1085
01:21:30,452 --> 01:21:32,443
Is Kahuna leaving?

1086
01:21:32,621 --> 01:21:36,182
I'll tell you something, Arch,
something I think you already know.

1087
01:21:36,358 --> 01:21:39,054
- What's that?
- You got a couple of real heroes...

1088
01:21:39,227 --> 01:21:40,319
...at home.

1089
01:21:44,933 --> 01:21:46,525
Yeah.

1090
01:21:46,768 --> 01:21:48,963
Yeah, I really do.

1091
01:21:50,538 --> 01:21:52,972
- Who's the big hero?
- Daddy! I love you.

1092
01:21:53,141 --> 01:21:54,631
Who's Daddy's little hero?

1093
01:21:54,809 --> 01:21:56,106
Take care, my friends.

1094
01:21:56,411 --> 01:21:58,845
- Say, "Bye, Kahuna. "
- Bye.

1095
01:21:59,014 --> 01:22:01,539
- Bye, Kahuna.
- Bye, Kahuna.

1096
01:22:01,716 --> 01:22:03,513
I'm gonna miss you.

1097
01:22:06,755 --> 01:22:08,723
Bye, Kahuna.

1098
01:22:09,224 --> 01:22:11,818
<i>The consumer report
also stated that sales...</i>

1099
01:22:11,993 --> 01:22:15,986
<i>...of children's books, music and toys
have tripled since last month.</i>

1100

1105

- Hey, buddy.</i>

1108
01:22:49,497 --> 01:22:51,362
You miss him, don't you?

1109
01:22:52,734 --> 01:22:55,726
I'm the bogeyman. I'm the bogeyman.
Bogeyman. Bogeyman.

1110
01:22:55,904 --> 01:22:58,202
You're the booger-man, you are.

1111
01:22:58,373 --> 01:23:00,898
Oh, that's not cool, Rosita.

1112
01:23:02,711 --> 01:23:04,042
Zack?

1113
01:23:07,515 --> 01:23:09,949
There's somebody here to see you.

1114
01:23:25,100 --> 01:23:27,796
Are you my... My mother?

1115
01:23:29,237 --> 01:23:32,434
- Mom, this is my friend, Kylie.
- Hi.

1116
01:23:32,607 --> 01:23:34,768
Kylie, this is my...

1117
01:23:35,877 --> 01:23:37,469
My mother.

1118
01:23:45,987 --> 01:23:48,285
Yay, Zack!

1119
01:24:05,740 --> 01:24:07,674
Kahuna.

1120
01:24:07,909 --> 01:24:10,673
Hey, Archie.

1121
01:24:13,481 --> 01:24:16,245
You're a full-fledged
Junior Kahuna now.

1122
01:24:16,418 --> 01:24:18,113
That's official.

1123
01:24:18,653 --> 01:24:21,247
- See you.
- Look after everybody.

1124
01:24:21,890 --> 01:24:23,881
I'll be seeing you.

1125
01:24:24,325 --> 01:24:26,850
I got an emergency
over in Europe.

1126
01:24:27,062 --> 01:24:30,088
But I'll be back!
