1
00:00:29,742 --> 00:00:30,993
Good morning, Doctor.

2
00:00:31,077 --> 00:00:33,162
Good morning, Charles.
You're looking splendid.

3
00:00:33,246 --> 00:00:34,664
I feel splendid.

4
00:00:34,747 --> 00:00:36,749
Every day, and in every way,
you're feeling..

5
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:38,876
Better and better.

6
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,420
- Indeed.
- Well, won't you sit here?

7
00:00:43,214 --> 00:00:44,715
Wouldn't you like me to..

8
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:47,093
Not unless you want to.

9
00:00:47,134 --> 00:00:50,596
No. I'll be quite comfortable here.
Thank you.

10
00:00:53,474 --> 00:00:55,643
Doctor, I'm surprised.

11
00:00:56,644 --> 00:00:58,771
Oh, of course. You quit.

12
00:00:59,814 --> 00:01:02,275
Three months ago.

13
00:01:02,316 --> 00:01:04,819
You know, there was a time
when your forgetfulness...

14
00:01:04,902 --> 00:01:07,071
would have made me feel
very rejected.

15
00:01:07,154 --> 00:01:11,117
- Not now, hmm?
- Well, a little rejected, perhaps.

16
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,246
- Did you do it intentionally?
- Why should I do that?

17
00:01:15,329 --> 00:01:16,747
Well...

18
00:01:16,831 --> 00:01:20,459
I'm a patient you consider
to be completely rehabilitated...

19
00:01:20,501 --> 00:01:24,130
on your recommendation soon to appear
before the sanity board...

20
00:01:24,213 --> 00:01:26,424
your reputation on the line.

21
00:01:26,507 --> 00:01:29,135
A little test, perhaps, hmm?

22
00:01:29,177 --> 00:01:32,054
Not very long ago,
an obvious trick like that...

23
00:01:32,138 --> 00:01:34,307
would have sent you
into a towering rage.

24
00:01:34,348 --> 00:01:37,143
And poor old Clouseau
would have silently...

25
00:01:37,185 --> 00:01:39,770
and passively submitted
to another massacre.

26
00:01:42,064 --> 00:01:45,067
It's a miracle you were somehow able
to keep putting him back together again.

27
00:01:46,861 --> 00:01:49,488
Poor old Clouseau.

28
00:01:49,572 --> 00:01:53,492
There was a time
when I couldn't even speak his name.

29
00:01:53,534 --> 00:01:57,038
And there was also a time
when you would joyfully have killed him.

30
00:01:57,121 --> 00:01:58,539
Yes.

31
00:02:00,124 --> 00:02:02,043
I was a sick man, wasn't l?

32
00:02:03,544 --> 00:02:05,463
We've come a long way, haven't we?

33
00:02:05,546 --> 00:02:09,717
And you're not even a little bit
bothered when you think of Clouseau?

34
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,637
Not even a little bit.

35
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,431
- Do you believe me?
- If you say so.

36
00:02:15,515 --> 00:02:17,433
Well, I could be lying.

37
00:02:17,517 --> 00:02:20,603
You are a good psychiatrist,
but I may be a better liar.

38
00:02:20,686 --> 00:02:23,940
For your sake, I hope you're not.

39
00:02:24,023 --> 00:02:27,026
Sooner or later,
you'd run into Clouseau...

40
00:02:27,068 --> 00:02:29,403
and then back here for life.

41
00:02:29,487 --> 00:02:32,281
No more chance
of another hearing.

42
00:02:32,365 --> 00:02:36,661
Coming here day after day, watching you
chain smoke into an early grave...

43
00:02:36,744 --> 00:02:41,332
and knowing on certain mornings, you'll
be particularly morose and testy...

44
00:02:41,415 --> 00:02:44,168
because you've had another fight
with your wife...

45
00:02:44,252 --> 00:02:46,170
Iike this morning.

46
00:02:46,254 --> 00:02:49,924
- How do you know that?
- It's the only time you doodle.

47
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,138
I keep forgetting you used to be
chief inspector of the Surete.

48
00:02:56,222 --> 00:02:57,849
And will be again.

49
00:02:57,932 --> 00:03:01,477
But Clouseau
is chief inspector now.

50
00:03:01,561 --> 00:03:04,063
Till the better man comes along.

51
00:03:04,105 --> 00:03:06,148
Well, in that case...

52
00:03:06,232 --> 00:03:10,236
I think lnspector Clouseau had better
start looking to his laurels.

53
00:03:11,487 --> 00:03:15,116
What? You mean...

54
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:18,619
The board meets at 2:00
this afternoon.

55
00:03:18,661 --> 00:03:20,454
This afternoon?

56
00:03:20,538 --> 00:03:24,333
If everything goes as I expect it to,
you'll be out of here this afternoon.

57
00:03:28,296 --> 00:03:30,756
- Thank you.
- See you at 2:00.

58
00:03:33,801 --> 00:03:35,720
Clouseau!

59
00:03:37,346 --> 00:03:38,848
Now, now, Doctor.

60
00:03:38,931 --> 00:03:43,102
Some people would consider
your methods most unorthodox.

61
00:03:43,144 --> 00:03:46,647
I was just making sure that you're not
a better liar than I am a psychiatrist.

62
00:03:48,065 --> 00:03:49,483
2:00.

63
00:03:58,659 --> 00:04:01,704
Come along. Good.

64
00:04:10,421 --> 00:04:11,839
How.

65
00:04:42,662 --> 00:04:44,080
Help!

66
00:04:48,376 --> 00:04:51,504
Grab hold of this.
Pull. Pull on this.

67
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,468
Help!

68
00:05:14,402 --> 00:05:16,779
Out with the bad air,
in with the good.

69
00:05:19,407 --> 00:05:21,534
Out, in.

70
00:05:21,617 --> 00:05:24,370
- Don't look, Fiona!
- Out, out.

71
00:05:24,412 --> 00:05:28,207
And now the kiss of life.

72
00:05:31,002 --> 00:05:32,420
Pervert!

73
00:05:36,591 --> 00:05:39,302
Dirty old men!

74
00:05:47,518 --> 00:05:50,771
Please, there is no need
to thank me.

75
00:05:50,813 --> 00:05:53,691
- Thank you?
- For saving your life.

76
00:05:53,774 --> 00:05:55,484
Someone...

77
00:05:55,568 --> 00:05:57,445
I was hit on the head.

78
00:05:57,486 --> 00:06:00,990
Yes, you have received a bump
upon the head.

79
00:06:01,073 --> 00:06:02,491
- "Beump"?
- What?

80
00:06:02,575 --> 00:06:05,077
- You said "beump."
- Yes, I know that.

81
00:06:05,119 --> 00:06:07,163
It is a large bump.

82
00:06:07,246 --> 00:06:09,957
You could receive a concussion
from such a bump.

83
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:11,959
- Allow me to assist you.
- No!

84
00:06:13,628 --> 00:06:16,130
I'm all right. I'm fine.

85
00:06:16,214 --> 00:06:20,259
Never better.
Just a little shaky.

86
00:06:20,301 --> 00:06:22,261
Probably the shock of...

87
00:06:22,303 --> 00:06:25,181
I mean, the surprise
of seeing you here again today.

88
00:06:25,264 --> 00:06:28,142
Well, I received a report...

89
00:06:28,226 --> 00:06:30,144
from the sanity commission...

90
00:06:30,228 --> 00:06:32,396
that they were going
to review your case today...

91
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:36,108
so I thought a few words from me
on your behalf...

92
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:40,571
Oh, God...
I mean, how generous of you, but...

93
00:06:40,655 --> 00:06:43,157
Well, I'm not without influence,
you know.

94
00:06:43,241 --> 00:06:44,867
Yes, I know that.

95
00:06:44,951 --> 00:06:48,663
Yes, I have become
a rather important official...

96
00:06:48,704 --> 00:06:50,665
in the department.

97
00:06:50,706 --> 00:06:54,418
I've heard you are the new
chief inspector.

98
00:06:54,502 --> 00:06:55,920
Yes.

99
00:07:04,512 --> 00:07:08,474
Yes, we made quite a few changes
since you went crazy.

100
00:07:08,558 --> 00:07:11,310
For the better, I'm sure.

101
00:07:11,352 --> 00:07:15,189
By the way, Sergeant Chevalier
sends you his kind regards.

102
00:07:15,231 --> 00:07:17,650
Oh, Sergeant Chevalier.

103
00:07:17,692 --> 00:07:21,988
Good old Sergeant Chevalier.
How is he, anyway?

104
00:07:22,029 --> 00:07:26,409
Well, you know, there are leaders
and there are followers...

105
00:07:26,492 --> 00:07:30,538
and I'm afraid Sergeant Chevalier
will always be a follower, no?

106
00:07:30,621 --> 00:07:32,498
Oh, yes.

107
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:36,002
And you, my friend Clouseau...
a leader, huh?

108
00:07:37,211 --> 00:07:42,175
Always a leader?
Onwards and upwards to the top, hmm?

109
00:07:42,258 --> 00:07:44,260
- It is my karma.
- What?

110
00:07:44,343 --> 00:07:46,679
- My destiny.
- Oh, yes.

111
00:07:48,389 --> 00:07:50,433
Yes, a few more years
on the force...

112
00:07:50,516 --> 00:07:54,520
and I might even be persuaded
to run for the public office.

113
00:07:56,898 --> 00:07:59,233
You can count on my vote.

114
00:07:59,275 --> 00:08:01,903
And you, my friend,
can count on me...

115
00:08:01,986 --> 00:08:05,198
to do everything in my power
to get you out of this place.

116
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,119
Oh, yes. I know how you feel.

117
00:08:10,203 --> 00:08:12,330
My hat. Well...

118
00:08:22,256 --> 00:08:24,926
Are you all right,
former Chief lnspector?

119
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:26,427
Yes!

120
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:31,057
Yes, I'm perfectly all right.

121
00:08:31,098 --> 00:08:32,558
See?

122
00:08:43,236 --> 00:08:46,614
One moment,
and I will have you extracted.

123
00:08:46,656 --> 00:08:49,075
I'm fine. I am perfect.

124
00:08:50,451 --> 00:08:53,037
Every day, and in every way...

125
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,623
I'm getting better and better.

126
00:08:55,706 --> 00:08:58,584
Somewhere over the rainbow

127
00:09:01,045 --> 00:09:04,549
I'm afraid that this
is just not your day, my friend.

128
00:09:04,632 --> 00:09:06,843
But it is my day.

129
00:09:06,926 --> 00:09:09,428
It is, my friend.

130
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:12,098
After three long terrible years...

131
00:09:12,139 --> 00:09:14,100
it is at last my day.

132
00:09:14,141 --> 00:09:17,895
I will not permit...
repeat... not permit anything...

133
00:09:17,979 --> 00:09:20,398
repeat...
anything to spoil it.

134
00:09:20,481 --> 00:09:23,526
Now, I will walk you to the gate...

135
00:09:23,609 --> 00:09:26,487
and I will kiss you good-bye...

136
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:30,491
and you will drive off
in your new car...

137
00:09:30,533 --> 00:09:32,702
which should rightfully be mine...

138
00:09:32,785 --> 00:09:36,789
and then I will have my interview
with the sanity commission.

139
00:09:36,831 --> 00:09:39,500
And they will set me free,
and then...

140
00:09:40,293 --> 00:09:42,628
I will kill you.

141
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:45,548
- Kill you!
- Francois!

142
00:09:46,382 --> 00:09:48,176
Start the car!

143
00:09:48,259 --> 00:09:51,512
Kill!

144
00:10:02,106 --> 00:10:05,026
I'll kill him!

145
00:10:07,695 --> 00:10:09,780
I want to kill him!

146
00:10:13,451 --> 00:10:15,369
I've got to kill him.

147
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:50,334
Oh, allow me.

148
00:14:07,894 --> 00:14:09,812
Cato?

149
00:16:29,744 --> 00:16:31,662
Forty winks.

150
00:19:26,128 --> 00:19:28,089
It's the phone.

151
00:19:30,091 --> 00:19:32,385
The phone is ringing.

152
00:19:39,517 --> 00:19:41,727
Relax. I'll get it.

153
00:19:44,897 --> 00:19:47,984
This is Chief lnspector Clouseau's
residence.

154
00:19:48,067 --> 00:19:50,862
This is Chief lnspector Clouseau...

155
00:19:50,945 --> 00:19:52,572
speaking on the phone.

156
00:19:52,655 --> 00:19:55,491
What? Oh, put him on.

157
00:19:57,577 --> 00:20:00,913
Good evening, Commissioner.

158
00:20:00,955 --> 00:20:04,709
How are you? How is Madame
and all the little commissioners?

159
00:20:12,758 --> 00:20:14,760
I see.

160
00:20:18,431 --> 00:20:20,349
Well, you can rest assured...

161
00:20:20,433 --> 00:20:24,145
that I shall take every precaution
that is necessary.

162
00:20:28,566 --> 00:20:31,277
Thank you, Commissioner,
and good evening.

163
00:20:35,948 --> 00:20:39,827
I have just received word
that former Chief lnspector Dreyfus...

164
00:20:39,869 --> 00:20:42,455
has escaped from the insane asylum.

165
00:20:42,497 --> 00:20:44,624
For some reason,
the deputy commissioner...

166
00:20:44,707 --> 00:20:47,293
thinks that he might try
to kill me.

167
00:20:47,335 --> 00:20:51,088
Obviously, the poor man is crazier
than anyone gives him credit for.

168
00:20:51,172 --> 00:20:53,758
Nevertheless, I am ordered
to take every precaution.

169
00:20:53,841 --> 00:20:56,010
See that the back and front doors
are locked...

170
00:20:56,093 --> 00:21:00,014
while I slip into
my new hunchback disguise.

171
00:21:46,143 --> 00:21:48,187
Both doors are locked now.

172
00:21:48,229 --> 00:21:50,189
Who are you?

173
00:21:51,732 --> 00:21:54,485
What have you done
with lnspector Clouseau?

174
00:21:54,569 --> 00:21:57,697
Chief lnspector Clouseau.

175
00:21:57,738 --> 00:22:00,449
Fooled you, didn't l?

176
00:22:00,533 --> 00:22:04,745
Oh, Chief lnspector,
that is fantastic.

177
00:22:04,829 --> 00:22:06,998
If you think this is fantastic...

178
00:22:07,081 --> 00:22:09,417
wait till you see the full effect
with the hump.

179
00:22:30,605 --> 00:22:33,357
The bells!

180
00:22:33,441 --> 00:22:35,359
They deafen me!

181
00:22:43,701 --> 00:22:46,037
Chief lnspector Clouseau?

182
00:22:48,498 --> 00:22:51,792
Yes, this is
Chief lnspector Clouseau.

183
00:22:51,876 --> 00:22:53,586
Who is speaking?

184
00:22:53,628 --> 00:22:56,631
My name is Duval.

185
00:22:59,008 --> 00:23:01,552
Claude Duval.

186
00:23:01,636 --> 00:23:06,098
I have the honor to be chairman...

187
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:09,310
of the Jacques Clouseau
presentation committee.

188
00:23:09,393 --> 00:23:14,232
The presentation committee?
For me?

189
00:23:14,315 --> 00:23:17,151
For what purpose, may I ask?

190
00:23:17,235 --> 00:23:20,363
For what purpose, you ask.

191
00:23:20,446 --> 00:23:22,406
How modest of you.

192
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:26,077
The purpose, monsieur,
is to honor...

193
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,372
one of the city's most dedicated...

194
00:23:29,455 --> 00:23:32,500
brave and selfless public servants.

195
00:23:32,583 --> 00:23:35,461
You are most generous, monsieur.
Most.

196
00:23:35,503 --> 00:23:39,966
Yes, I must admit I have often wondered,
considering my years on the force...

197
00:23:40,007 --> 00:23:44,470
and my numerous accomplishments, why
recognition was not forthcoming earlier.

198
00:23:44,512 --> 00:23:46,931
Absolutely right.

199
00:23:47,014 --> 00:23:50,810
Nine years faithful service
at the Surete...

200
00:23:50,852 --> 00:23:53,938
and not as much as a single decoration
in all that time.

201
00:23:55,273 --> 00:23:58,025
Yes, that is quite correct.

202
00:23:58,067 --> 00:24:00,820
However,
as you are no doubt aware...

203
00:24:00,862 --> 00:24:04,699
I have recently received
an important promotion.

204
00:24:04,782 --> 00:24:06,075
Really?

205
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:10,705
I have replaced the lunatic Dreyfus
as chief inspector.

206
00:24:10,788 --> 00:24:16,043
I know, and I'm sure Paris sleeps
the more safely because of the change.

207
00:24:16,085 --> 00:24:18,546
You're very most kind.

208
00:24:18,588 --> 00:24:22,216
But I can assure you when it comes
to matters of keeping the peace...

209
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,718
I'm always on my toes.

210
00:24:23,801 --> 00:24:25,219
Chief lnspector.

211
00:24:25,303 --> 00:24:27,555
One moment, please.

212
00:24:27,597 --> 00:24:30,892
Can't you see
that I'm on the phone?

213
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,801
Oh, yes, Commissioner.

214
00:25:05,885 --> 00:25:09,680
Fortunately, there was sufficient air
still left in my hump...

215
00:25:09,764 --> 00:25:12,141
to keep me afloat
until the rescue.

216
00:25:12,225 --> 00:25:16,437
Yes. Well, thank you very much,
Commissioner. Good-bye.

217
00:25:16,521 --> 00:25:19,774
That was the commissioner.
He was most concerned.

218
00:25:19,815 --> 00:25:22,401
Well, you have been
very, very lucky, you know.

219
00:25:22,485 --> 00:25:26,447
Yes, I know. Poor Cato
will be in the hospital for weeks.

220
00:25:26,489 --> 00:25:28,950
Do you know what kind
of a bomb it was?

221
00:25:28,991 --> 00:25:30,993
The exploding kind.

222
00:25:31,077 --> 00:25:34,622
Mark my words, Francois.
Sinister forces are at work.

223
00:25:34,705 --> 00:25:39,126
And this mad bomber
must be apprehended at all costs.

224
00:25:39,168 --> 00:25:41,963
Make sure you issue
an all-points bulletin immediately.

225
00:25:42,046 --> 00:25:44,507
- Yes, sir.
- What about my clothes?

226
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:47,593
Oh, Sergeant Chauvin
is rounding some up for you.

227
00:25:47,677 --> 00:25:49,637
While you're waiting,
perhaps you'll sign the order...

228
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,639
to transport Jean Tournier
to prison.

229
00:25:51,722 --> 00:25:55,601
Tournier the bank robber?
I shall be happy to sign that order.

230
00:25:55,643 --> 00:25:58,980
Ah, it's life for you
this time, Tournier.

231
00:25:59,021 --> 00:26:01,732
At last, we are rid of you.

232
00:26:11,492 --> 00:26:13,244
I have to go to the toilet.

233
00:26:14,996 --> 00:26:16,414
All right.

234
00:26:31,095 --> 00:26:33,014
Thank you.

235
00:27:07,882 --> 00:27:09,800
All right, Tournier.
That's long enough.

236
00:27:21,312 --> 00:27:23,481
Now this is my plan.

237
00:27:23,564 --> 00:27:25,483
Step number one:

238
00:27:25,566 --> 00:27:30,488
I will recruit the world's greatest
criminal minds. Step number two:

239
00:27:30,571 --> 00:27:35,284
I will build an organization
so sinister, so powerful...

240
00:27:35,368 --> 00:27:39,664
by comparison, the Cosa Nostra
will seem like the Vienna Boys Choir.

241
00:27:39,747 --> 00:27:44,126
- Here is the list.
- But half of these men are in prison.

242
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:47,088
- We'll get them out.
- Impossible.

243
00:27:47,171 --> 00:27:49,882
I'll bet you 20 million francs
it isn't.

244
00:27:49,924 --> 00:27:53,052
- Where would I get 20 million francs?
- I thought you'd ask that.

245
00:27:53,135 --> 00:27:57,223
Step number three: Next Thursday
at precisely 2:00 p.m...

246
00:27:57,306 --> 00:28:02,436
you and six men will enter the main
branch of the Paris credit bank.

247
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:06,107
This afternoon, at approximately
five minutes to 5:00...

248
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:09,151
three men dressed in building
maintenance uniforms...

249
00:28:09,235 --> 00:28:11,863
entered and robbed
the Paris credit bank.

250
00:28:12,947 --> 00:28:16,534
The leader has been identified
as Jean Tournier.

251
00:28:20,413 --> 00:28:22,623
How much did they get?

252
00:28:22,707 --> 00:28:25,459
Millions. Here's the report.

253
00:28:26,627 --> 00:28:29,380
All right. That will be all,
Francois. Thank you.

254
00:28:32,466 --> 00:28:34,427
Twenty million francs.

255
00:28:35,636 --> 00:28:38,389
And now, the next step.

256
00:29:41,452 --> 00:29:43,996
Hugo Fassbender and his daughter
have been kidnapped.

257
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,666
- Professor Fassbender?
- Yes. Paris has a theory.

258
00:29:46,749 --> 00:29:50,169
They're sending over their top man...
a Chief lnspector Clouseau.

259
00:29:50,211 --> 00:29:54,966
He just sent this telegram. "Arrived
Gatwick Airport, B.R. 121, 12:38 p.m."

260
00:30:16,237 --> 00:30:18,156
Yes? Who are you?

261
00:30:18,239 --> 00:30:21,159
- Jarvis, sir.
- And what is it you do?

262
00:30:21,242 --> 00:30:24,245
- I am the butler.
- Ah, the butler. Yes, yes.

263
00:30:24,328 --> 00:30:27,874
Can you tell me where you were
on the night of the kidnapping?

264
00:30:27,915 --> 00:30:31,127
- Asleep in my room, sir.
- Asleep in your room.

265
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:33,421
- Can you prove that?
- No.

266
00:30:33,504 --> 00:30:35,631
Make a note of that,
Sergeant Yard.

267
00:30:35,715 --> 00:30:38,134
Tell the staff to assemble
in the drawing room.

268
00:30:38,217 --> 00:30:40,469
I will interview them
in a few moments.

269
00:30:40,553 --> 00:30:42,471
Yes, sir.

270
00:30:43,973 --> 00:30:46,517
- What was your name again?
- Jarvis.

271
00:30:46,601 --> 00:30:50,688
Jarvis, that's right. Perhaps you'll be
kind enough to show me around the house.

272
00:30:50,771 --> 00:30:52,690
Very good, sir.

273
00:30:57,904 --> 00:31:00,740
I suggest we start
with the upstairs.

274
00:31:00,781 --> 00:31:04,494
- This is the upstairs, sir.
- Yes, I know that.

275
00:31:26,849 --> 00:31:28,643
This is a door.

276
00:31:28,684 --> 00:31:30,811
Yes, that is a door.

277
00:31:30,895 --> 00:31:34,023
- Yes, I know that.
- It's not locked, sir.

278
00:31:36,275 --> 00:31:37,693
Obviously.

279
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:42,990
Stay where you are.
I prefer to handle this alone.

280
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:59,131
Is there anybody hiding there
in the dark?

281
00:32:17,358 --> 00:32:21,362
Nothing like a good warm-up
when you're on a case, you know?

282
00:32:21,445 --> 00:32:26,492
Tell me, which switch did you use
to turn on the lights?

283
00:32:26,534 --> 00:32:28,494
The light switch, sir.

284
00:32:33,708 --> 00:32:35,668
Strange. It didn't work for me.

285
00:32:39,338 --> 00:32:41,257
Yes.

286
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:47,180
Unless I miss my guess,
this would be the gymnasium room.

287
00:32:47,221 --> 00:32:51,309
- Yes, sir.
- Yes. It is a good room.

288
00:32:51,392 --> 00:32:52,810
Yes.

289
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:03,237
This reminds me of my younger days
at the Surete police academy.

290
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:06,407
The parallel bars... my speciality.

291
00:33:06,491 --> 00:33:09,577
I was something of an athlete,
you know. Yes, yes.

292
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:14,165
I was known as the Pavlova
of the parallels.

293
00:33:14,248 --> 00:33:15,666
Oh, yes.

294
00:33:18,377 --> 00:33:21,130
Yes, it's all coming back now.

295
00:33:21,214 --> 00:33:24,300
Yes, I remember it...

296
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:36,062
Well, that felt good!

297
00:33:37,438 --> 00:33:41,943
Well, now. I expect you're all wondering
why I asked you here.

298
00:34:16,978 --> 00:34:19,647
It's obvious that the knight
that wore that suit...

299
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:22,149
did not last very long.

300
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:32,326
Yes, yes. I know.

301
00:34:32,410 --> 00:34:34,328
Now.

302
00:34:34,412 --> 00:34:36,664
Yes. As I was saying...

303
00:34:36,747 --> 00:34:40,751
You were saying you supposed
we were all wondering why you called us.

304
00:34:40,835 --> 00:34:45,298
Look. There is no need for you to speak
unless I ask you a question.

305
00:34:45,381 --> 00:34:48,342
- What is your name?
- I'm Shork, the gardener.

306
00:34:48,384 --> 00:34:50,928
- And what is it you do?
- I'm the gardener.

307
00:34:51,012 --> 00:34:52,972
Why didn't you say that
in the first place?

308
00:34:53,055 --> 00:34:56,142
- I did.
- Don't be funny with me, monsieur.

309
00:34:56,225 --> 00:34:58,519
This is a very serious matter...

310
00:34:58,603 --> 00:35:02,023
and everyone in this room
is under the suspicions.

311
00:35:02,064 --> 00:35:03,858
- "Reum"?
- What? What was that?

312
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,110
- You said, "Reum."
- Yes, I know that.

313
00:35:06,194 --> 00:35:08,863
And there is a very good chance
that someone in this room...

314
00:35:08,946 --> 00:35:12,366
knows more about the murder
than he is telling.

315
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:14,368
- Murder?
- What was that you said?

316
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:16,370
- I said murder.
- What murder?

317
00:35:16,454 --> 00:35:18,789
Well, I don't know.
You said murder.

318
00:35:18,873 --> 00:35:20,833
I said murder?
You said murder!

319
00:35:20,875 --> 00:35:23,711
No, I said murder
because you said murder!

320
00:35:23,753 --> 00:35:27,006
- I said murder?
- You said someone in this room...

321
00:35:27,048 --> 00:35:30,885
knows more about the murder
than he's telling.

322
00:35:30,927 --> 00:35:32,887
Now listen...

323
00:35:34,555 --> 00:35:36,182
- What was your name?
- Shork.

324
00:35:36,265 --> 00:35:38,809
- The cook.
- Gardener.

325
00:35:38,893 --> 00:35:41,521
Now we are getting somewhere.

326
00:35:41,604 --> 00:35:43,356
You...

327
00:35:43,397 --> 00:35:45,399
Oh, dear!

328
00:35:45,441 --> 00:35:48,027
Are you all right,
Mr. Stutterstutt?

329
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:50,404
- Who is this man?
- He's Mr. Stutterstutt.

330
00:35:50,446 --> 00:35:52,907
I see, and what is your job,
Mr. Stuckerstuff?

331
00:35:52,949 --> 00:35:54,408
He's the beekeeper.

332
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:57,411
I'm not asking you.
I'm asking Mr. Stuffsucker.

333
00:35:57,495 --> 00:36:00,206
What's that? What is he saying to you?
What? What was that?

334
00:36:00,248 --> 00:36:03,501
He says he's got a bit of a cold,
and he's lost his voice.

335
00:36:03,584 --> 00:36:07,713
Lost his voice. A beekeeper
who has lost his voice...

336
00:36:07,755 --> 00:36:09,882
a cook who thinks he's a gardener...

337
00:36:09,966 --> 00:36:12,385
and a witness to a murder.

338
00:36:12,426 --> 00:36:15,847
Oh, yes. It is obvious
to my trained eye...

339
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:18,766
that there is much more
going on here...

340
00:36:18,808 --> 00:36:20,768
than meets the ear.

341
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:32,613
Before you are dismissed,
Mr. Stiffsticker...

342
00:36:32,697 --> 00:36:35,116
I suggest you count your bees.

343
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:37,910
You may find that one of them
is missing.

344
00:36:37,994 --> 00:36:39,579
You ruined that piano!

345
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,581
What is the price of one piano...

346
00:36:41,622 --> 00:36:44,959
compared to the terrible crime
that has been committed here?

347
00:36:45,042 --> 00:36:47,295
But that's a priceless Steinway!

348
00:36:47,378 --> 00:36:50,423
Not anymore. What is your name?

349
00:36:50,464 --> 00:36:52,466
Mrs. Leverlilly.

350
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:55,845
Mrs. Loveliver.
I would take a shrewd guess...

351
00:36:55,928 --> 00:36:58,097
that you are the housekeeper,
right?

352
00:36:58,181 --> 00:37:01,976
I have been with Professor Fassbender
for 30 years.

353
00:37:02,059 --> 00:37:05,104
That would account
for your exaggerated hysteria...

354
00:37:05,146 --> 00:37:07,064
over a simple blemish
on the furniture.

355
00:37:07,148 --> 00:37:08,482
Blemish!

356
00:37:08,524 --> 00:37:12,153
Whatever has happened to the piano
can easily be repaired.

357
00:37:12,236 --> 00:37:14,155
What has happened
to Professor Fassbender...

358
00:37:14,238 --> 00:37:17,116
and his daughter
is another matter.

359
00:37:17,158 --> 00:37:22,622
And it is my job to bring the guilty
party, or parties, to their justice.

360
00:37:22,705 --> 00:37:24,790
Now, then, what do we know?

361
00:37:24,874 --> 00:37:28,294
One: That Professor Fassbender...

362
00:37:28,336 --> 00:37:30,630
and his daughter
have been kidnapped.

363
00:37:30,671 --> 00:37:36,511
Two: Someone has kidnapped them.

364
00:37:36,552 --> 00:37:39,931
Three: My hand is on fire.

365
00:37:53,194 --> 00:37:55,112
Drummond, what's going on?

366
00:37:55,196 --> 00:37:56,697
Good afternoon, sir.

367
00:37:56,781 --> 00:38:00,535
Inspector Clouseau
has been interrogating the staff.

368
00:38:01,619 --> 00:38:03,871
Inspector Clouseau,
Superintendent Quinlan.

369
00:38:03,955 --> 00:38:05,665
Oh, lnspector.

370
00:38:05,706 --> 00:38:07,291
Superintendent.

371
00:38:30,648 --> 00:38:32,567
Why don't you just tell Potters
that he's incompetent...

372
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:35,528
and request that he be taken off
the case?

373
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:39,782
Because we've got enough trouble
with France...

374
00:38:39,866 --> 00:38:43,995
without suggesting that
their greatest detective is a fool.

375
00:38:46,581 --> 00:38:47,999
Steady.

376
00:38:50,084 --> 00:38:52,044
Where is he now?

377
00:38:53,087 --> 00:38:55,214
He is shadowing
the Fassbender farm.

378
00:40:05,576 --> 00:40:07,495
Hello, sailor.

379
00:40:09,163 --> 00:40:11,082
- Yes?
- Who are you?

380
00:40:11,165 --> 00:40:13,084
Chuck. Who are you?

381
00:40:20,508 --> 00:40:21,926
What's that?

382
00:40:22,009 --> 00:40:26,347
I am Chief lnspector Jacques Clouseau
of the Surete.

383
00:40:26,389 --> 00:40:30,268
-How exciting.
-I think I will just take a look around.

384
00:40:30,351 --> 00:40:33,271
Yes. Well, you'll have to make use
of the bar first or take a table.

385
00:40:33,354 --> 00:40:36,816
- The show starts in a few minutes.
- In that case, I will take the table.

386
00:40:36,899 --> 00:40:39,026
Right. Follow me, Jock.

387
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:41,279
- Jacques.
- Jack?

388
00:40:46,284 --> 00:40:48,744
Ladies and gentlemen, once again...

389
00:40:48,828 --> 00:40:51,330
it is my profound pleasure
to introduce...

390
00:40:51,372 --> 00:40:54,208
the incomparable Ainsley Jarvis!

391
00:41:03,551 --> 00:41:08,306
What's a queen

392
00:41:08,389 --> 00:41:11,142
Without a castle

393
00:41:11,225 --> 00:41:13,728
You're right

394
00:41:13,811 --> 00:41:17,356
No queen at all

395
00:41:17,398 --> 00:41:22,904
And you'd be right again to say

396
00:41:22,987 --> 00:41:26,782
The winter's day

397
00:41:26,866 --> 00:41:29,994
Is cold

398
00:41:30,077 --> 00:41:32,622
Till you

399
00:41:32,705 --> 00:41:36,709
Come

400
00:41:41,589 --> 00:41:45,593
Until you love me

401
00:41:45,676 --> 00:41:49,847
I always will be wanting

402
00:41:49,931 --> 00:41:52,391
This need I need

403
00:41:52,433 --> 00:41:55,561
Can come from only

404
00:41:55,603 --> 00:41:58,481
You

405
00:41:58,564 --> 00:42:02,777
Until you love me

406
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:06,781
I'll live a life of longing

407
00:42:06,864 --> 00:42:10,201
For that's the next best thing

408
00:42:10,284 --> 00:42:14,372
I can do

409
00:42:15,456 --> 00:42:19,627
No way of knowing

410
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:24,257
Which way you're heart is going

411
00:42:24,298 --> 00:42:26,926
To go

412
00:42:27,009 --> 00:42:32,265
I don't think you know

413
00:42:32,306 --> 00:42:36,143
Take as long as it takes

414
00:42:36,227 --> 00:42:39,522
Your love

415
00:42:39,605 --> 00:42:41,524
To grow

416
00:42:44,652 --> 00:42:48,739
Until you love me

417
00:42:48,823 --> 00:42:52,785
Not one dream can come true

418
00:42:52,869 --> 00:42:57,123
In all my dreams

419
00:42:57,165 --> 00:42:59,959
There is a place

420
00:43:00,001 --> 00:43:02,920
For you

421
00:43:03,004 --> 00:43:08,384
And so I'll keep those dreams

422
00:43:08,467 --> 00:43:10,845
Until

423
00:43:10,887 --> 00:43:15,224
You love me

424
00:43:15,308 --> 00:43:20,688
Too

425
00:43:38,372 --> 00:43:42,502
Why is it that this afternoon
you are Jarvis, the Fassbender butler...

426
00:43:42,585 --> 00:43:44,670
and tonight, you are...

427
00:43:44,754 --> 00:43:49,300
- Inspector, before you get all...
- Madame or monsieur, I must warn you.

428
00:43:49,383 --> 00:43:51,802
You had better watch your step.

429
00:43:58,059 --> 00:44:01,229
- Something wrong, Ainsley?
- Of course not, Bruno.

430
00:44:01,312 --> 00:44:04,774
No, the inspector was just warning me
that I had to watch my step.

431
00:44:04,857 --> 00:44:08,694
You see, back in France,
he's known as king of the tango.

432
00:44:08,736 --> 00:44:11,072
- Tango?
- Oh, I'd love to.

433
00:44:22,124 --> 00:44:24,585
- The kidnappers are here.
- Kidnappers?

434
00:44:31,217 --> 00:44:32,927
Okay. Let's go.

435
00:45:22,143 --> 00:45:24,729
You want to call Paris now?

436
00:45:33,863 --> 00:45:36,741
Look at it this way.
It can't possibly get any worse.

437
00:46:24,413 --> 00:46:26,916
Professor Fassbender!

438
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:33,965
What an honor to have you
and your charming daughter as my guests.

439
00:46:34,048 --> 00:46:37,176
- Who the devil are you?
- Ah, yes. Who the devil, indeed.

440
00:46:37,218 --> 00:46:40,179
Come. Sit down.
Let us just say for the moment...

441
00:46:40,221 --> 00:46:43,099
that I'm your host and that I will do
everything in my power...

442
00:46:43,182 --> 00:46:46,853
to make your stay here at Mondschien
Castle as pleasant as possible.

443
00:46:46,936 --> 00:46:48,896
Providing, of course...

444
00:46:48,938 --> 00:46:53,401
that you reciprocate by giving me
something that I very much want.

445
00:46:54,443 --> 00:46:57,238
And that would be?

446
00:46:57,321 --> 00:47:02,326
I am fascinated by your work
on time-space relationships...

447
00:47:02,410 --> 00:47:07,081
particularly the vortices
of electromagnetic aberrations.

448
00:47:07,165 --> 00:47:09,125
I see.

449
00:47:09,208 --> 00:47:11,460
And do you work
for a particular government...

450
00:47:11,544 --> 00:47:14,046
or do you expect to sell
my discovery to the highest bidder?

451
00:47:14,088 --> 00:47:17,800
Neither, Professor.
Nothing so mundane.

452
00:47:17,884 --> 00:47:21,387
You and l... we're going
to join forces, Professor.

453
00:47:21,470 --> 00:47:25,349
We're going to build the Doomsday
Machine and conquer the world.

454
00:47:25,433 --> 00:47:28,269
- Have a sweet.
- You're mad.

455
00:47:28,352 --> 00:47:31,606
Mad? On the contrary...

456
00:47:31,689 --> 00:47:34,400
every day, in every way...

457
00:47:34,442 --> 00:47:36,861
I've been getting better
and better.

458
00:47:37,778 --> 00:47:40,948
Mad? Was Hannibal mad?

459
00:47:41,032 --> 00:47:46,204
Or Alexander? Surely Napoleon
was the maddest of them all. Mad?

460
00:47:47,413 --> 00:47:49,332
We shall see, Professor.

461
00:47:49,415 --> 00:47:53,044
- I shall tell you nothing.
- I think you will.

462
00:47:58,966 --> 00:48:01,302
I'll die first.

463
00:48:03,513 --> 00:48:05,932
Show Miss Fassbender
to the schoolroom.

464
00:48:06,933 --> 00:48:08,351
Daddy?

465
00:48:27,662 --> 00:48:29,121
What are you going to do?

466
00:48:29,163 --> 00:48:33,376
Something so very, very painful,
so hideous...

467
00:48:33,459 --> 00:48:36,128
your father will have no choice
but to cooperate.

468
00:48:50,017 --> 00:48:53,646
All right.
I'll tell you anything.

469
00:48:57,066 --> 00:48:59,527
The Wolverines certainly have to put
some points on the scoreboard.

470
00:48:59,610 --> 00:49:01,529
I'm sure that Green
will come out throwing.

471
00:49:01,612 --> 00:49:05,032
He's got to get that ball
down deep into Navy territory.

472
00:49:05,074 --> 00:49:07,410
Green now on third down.
Looks to the left, throws it...

473
00:49:07,493 --> 00:49:09,453
All right, team! Let's go!

474
00:49:09,537 --> 00:49:12,999
Throw's complete to Rhodes!
He's inside the 15! He's to the 20!

475
00:49:13,082 --> 00:49:16,127
The clock is running down.
Can the Wolverines do it?

476
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,882
- What happened?
- Where's the game?

477
00:49:20,923 --> 00:49:23,467
- Who is that?
- Hello there.

478
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:29,223
- He's on every station.
- Well, call the F.C.C.

479
00:49:29,307 --> 00:49:31,642
Hold it! He's saying something.

480
00:49:31,726 --> 00:49:35,188
Mr. President, everybody, calm down.

481
00:49:35,229 --> 00:49:38,858
Calm down, hell!
This is an emergen...

482
00:49:38,941 --> 00:49:41,194
An emergency.
Did Michigan score?

483
00:49:41,277 --> 00:49:44,155
Please, let's hear
what the fellow has to say.

484
00:49:44,238 --> 00:49:46,616
It is little enough to ask...

485
00:49:46,699 --> 00:49:48,284
the life of one man...

486
00:49:48,367 --> 00:49:50,786
against a holocaust...

487
00:49:50,870 --> 00:49:53,039
that could destroy the globe.

488
00:49:54,123 --> 00:49:56,584
What the hell's he talking about?

489
00:49:56,626 --> 00:49:58,294
Quiet.

490
00:49:58,377 --> 00:50:00,630
That's why I say again...

491
00:50:00,713 --> 00:50:03,508
give me Clouseau.

492
00:50:04,926 --> 00:50:08,721
- And we can all sleep secure in bed.
- What's a Clouseau?

493
00:50:08,763 --> 00:50:11,766
And so, next week...

494
00:50:11,849 --> 00:50:16,813
I shall give the world a demonstration
of the awesome power I hold.

495
00:50:16,896 --> 00:50:19,398
On Saturday, October 9th...

496
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:23,402
at precisely 3:00 p.m.
Eastern Standard Time...

497
00:50:23,444 --> 00:50:26,072
the United Nations building...

498
00:50:27,698 --> 00:50:30,326
Will vanish
from the face of the earth.

499
00:50:33,454 --> 00:50:35,414
And the gun goes off.
The game is over.

500
00:50:35,456 --> 00:50:38,584
Call the F.B.I., the C.I.A.
and the Pentagon.

501
00:50:38,626 --> 00:50:40,753
Find out who won the game!

502
00:50:45,132 --> 00:50:47,510
That's a photograph taken
by an American news photographer...

503
00:50:47,593 --> 00:50:49,512
while the broadcast
was in progress.

504
00:50:50,972 --> 00:50:54,100
Paris has identified him
as one Charles Dreyfus...

505
00:50:54,141 --> 00:50:57,103
former chief inspector
of the Surete.

506
00:50:58,187 --> 00:51:00,273
- You're joking.
- And more recently an inmate...

507
00:51:00,314 --> 00:51:04,068
at the state facility
for the criminally insane.

508
00:51:04,152 --> 00:51:07,113
Until he escaped.
Here's a text of his speech.

509
00:51:08,823 --> 00:51:10,783
He obviously controls equipment...

510
00:51:10,825 --> 00:51:12,785
sophisticated enough
to pirate the satellite.

511
00:51:12,827 --> 00:51:15,413
"Give me Clouseau, and we can all
sleep secure in our beds."

512
00:51:15,496 --> 00:51:17,415
Thought that might interest you.

513
00:51:17,498 --> 00:51:19,959
That's one crazy chief inspector talking
about another crazy chief inspector.

514
00:51:20,042 --> 00:51:23,004
What does he mean anyway?
"Give me Clouseau."

515
00:51:23,045 --> 00:51:26,549
Listen to this. "Little enough
to ask the life of one man...

516
00:51:26,632 --> 00:51:29,135
against a holocaust
that could destroy the globe."

517
00:51:29,177 --> 00:51:31,137
You missed the best bit. Look.

518
00:51:31,179 --> 00:51:33,764
He also threatens
to make the U.N. building disappear.

519
00:51:37,977 --> 00:51:41,022
- Operation Looking Glass?
- Fassbender.

520
00:51:41,105 --> 00:51:44,192
Give me Lovell. Home Office.

521
00:51:44,275 --> 00:51:47,236
- Where's Clouseau?
- I've no idea.

522
00:52:00,166 --> 00:52:03,169
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
once again...

523
00:52:03,252 --> 00:52:07,048
the incomparable Ainsley Jarvis.

524
00:52:24,899 --> 00:52:26,818
Monsieur Jarvis?

525
00:52:58,266 --> 00:53:01,227
- Sir, the coroner's report.
- Ah, yes.

526
00:53:01,269 --> 00:53:03,729
It's amazing. Even after
he had been stabbed twice...

527
00:53:03,771 --> 00:53:05,815
he was still able
to break the kidnapper's neck.

528
00:53:05,898 --> 00:53:09,902
- Ah, pity.
- Yes, he had a lovely voice.

529
00:53:11,654 --> 00:53:15,449
I meant pity that the kidnapper's dead.
We might have got something from him.

530
00:53:15,491 --> 00:53:18,953
- I did get something out of him.
- What?

531
00:53:19,036 --> 00:53:20,955
What's that?

532
00:53:23,124 --> 00:53:25,668
- A clue.
- Clue?

533
00:53:25,751 --> 00:53:29,255
- What?
- You said a clue.

534
00:53:29,297 --> 00:53:32,175
Yes. A brochure clue...

535
00:53:32,258 --> 00:53:35,094
advertising the Oktoberfest
in Munich.

536
00:53:35,136 --> 00:53:37,847
It begins the day after tomorrow.

537
00:53:37,930 --> 00:53:41,225
And you think the dead man was planning
to go there, perhaps to meet someone?

538
00:53:41,309 --> 00:53:44,687
Yes. Perhaps to meet...

539
00:53:44,770 --> 00:53:46,939
the lunatic Dreyfus.

540
00:53:48,816 --> 00:53:52,653
At one time,
partners in the war against crime...

541
00:53:52,695 --> 00:53:55,698
now archenemies.

542
00:54:00,453 --> 00:54:04,832
- You'll need help.
- I prefer to do this alone.

543
00:54:04,874 --> 00:54:08,794
Yes, but if Dreyfus is what we suspect,
he probably has an army behind him.

544
00:54:08,836 --> 00:54:12,215
Of course it won't be easy,
but nothing worthwhile ever is.

545
00:54:12,298 --> 00:54:16,385
That is why I have always failed
where others have succeeded.

546
00:54:16,469 --> 00:54:21,724
For me, the greater the odds,
the greater the challenge.

547
00:54:21,807 --> 00:54:25,812
And, as always,
I accept the challenge.

548
00:54:25,895 --> 00:54:29,565
Well, I am off to Munich.

549
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:39,742
Most ingenious.
The old closet ploy.

550
00:54:39,826 --> 00:54:43,204
I really must congratulate you.
If there's one thing I do enjoy...

551
00:54:43,287 --> 00:54:45,623
it's a good closet ploy.

552
00:54:45,706 --> 00:54:49,168
Well, until we meet again
and the case is solved.

553
00:54:51,754 --> 00:54:53,714
The case is solved.

554
00:55:37,258 --> 00:55:39,385
Four minutes.

555
00:55:39,427 --> 00:55:44,390
We're gonna look like a bunch
of Dipsy Doodles if this is a hoax.

556
00:55:44,432 --> 00:55:46,392
Well...

557
00:55:46,434 --> 00:55:49,103
we would look very foolish
if we didn't take every precaution...

558
00:55:49,187 --> 00:55:51,022
and it turned out
not to be a hoax.

559
00:55:51,105 --> 00:55:55,193
Dr. Fassbender and Operation Looking
Glass are certainly no hoax.

560
00:55:55,276 --> 00:56:00,406
God. A weapon like that
in the hands of a crazy Frenchman.

561
00:56:02,450 --> 00:56:04,994
You are certain?
You can do it?

562
00:56:05,077 --> 00:56:08,289
- Theoretically, yes.
- For your daughter's sake, I hope so.

563
00:56:08,372 --> 00:56:10,291
Ah, the dreams I had.

564
00:56:10,374 --> 00:56:14,212
All the terrible things I was going
to do to that sweet child if you failed.

565
00:56:14,295 --> 00:56:16,714
- Look, I've done everything you asked.
- Not yet.

566
00:56:16,797 --> 00:56:18,883
When the U.N. building vanishes...

567
00:56:18,966 --> 00:56:21,344
then you will have done everything
I asked.

568
00:56:21,427 --> 00:56:25,056
What do you suppose
they will call the crater?

569
00:56:25,139 --> 00:56:27,266
The Dreyfus Ditch!

570
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:30,102
- There should be no crater.
- No crater?

571
00:56:30,186 --> 00:56:33,648
But I want a crater.
I want wreckage, twisted metal.

572
00:56:33,689 --> 00:56:35,942
Something the world
will not forget.

573
00:56:35,983 --> 00:56:39,403
- They will not forget today.
- They won't? Wonderful.

574
00:56:39,487 --> 00:56:41,447
I have to tinkle again.
Don't do anything till I get back.

575
00:56:41,489 --> 00:56:43,574
Too late. The countdown started.

576
00:56:43,658 --> 00:56:45,576
One minute.

577
00:57:18,943 --> 00:57:20,486
Thirty seconds.

578
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:23,781
Seven, six...

579
00:57:23,865 --> 00:57:26,993
five, four...

580
00:57:27,034 --> 00:57:31,330
three, two, one!

581
00:57:31,414 --> 00:57:32,874
Ignition!

582
00:57:48,598 --> 00:57:51,058
Today...

583
00:57:51,142 --> 00:57:53,060
the U.N. building.

584
00:57:54,187 --> 00:57:56,647
Tomorrow, who knows?

585
00:57:57,732 --> 00:58:00,193
I think by now that the nations
of the world are aware of the...

586
00:58:00,276 --> 00:58:02,695
the awesome power which I control...

587
00:58:02,778 --> 00:58:04,822
a power so great...

588
00:58:04,906 --> 00:58:08,743
if I choose,
I could wipe out an entire city.

589
00:58:08,826 --> 00:58:11,078
After all,
what is the life of a man...

590
00:58:11,162 --> 00:58:15,458
compared to the destruction
of a whole city?

591
00:58:16,584 --> 00:58:19,420
I give you seven days.

592
00:58:19,504 --> 00:58:21,672
Seven days.

593
00:58:21,756 --> 00:58:23,508
Okay.

594
00:58:24,634 --> 00:58:26,928
Well done.

595
00:58:27,011 --> 00:58:29,597
So, now we wait.

596
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:32,141
All this to get one cop?

597
00:58:32,183 --> 00:58:35,228
But we have some of the finest
hit men here in Europe.

598
00:58:35,311 --> 00:58:38,356
-In this very room.
-Why don't we take care of it ourselves?

599
00:58:38,439 --> 00:58:41,359
- Because you wouldn't stand a chance.
- Come on.

600
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:44,779
- You don't know Clouseau.
- He can't be that good.

601
00:58:44,862 --> 00:58:47,240
Good? He's not good.

602
00:58:47,323 --> 00:58:50,827
He's terrible.
He's the worst.

603
00:58:50,868 --> 00:58:54,330
There is not any man like him
anywhere in the world.

604
00:58:54,372 --> 00:58:57,750
Compared to Clouseau,
this Doomsday Machine...

605
00:58:57,834 --> 00:59:00,211
is just a water pistol.

606
00:59:00,253 --> 00:59:03,631
That's why it will take
all the great nations...

607
00:59:04,882 --> 00:59:06,843
with all of their
trained assassins...

608
00:59:07,885 --> 00:59:11,013
and all of their
sophisticated murder weapons...

609
00:59:11,055 --> 00:59:13,432
to eliminate Clouseau.

610
00:59:20,148 --> 00:59:22,066
Taxi, please.

611
00:59:28,739 --> 00:59:29,907
This gentleman...

612
00:59:29,991 --> 00:59:32,869
- What are you doing?
- That's my case.

613
00:59:35,872 --> 00:59:40,209
Lucky for you, I am in a hurry.
Otherwise you would have been arrested.

614
00:59:40,251 --> 00:59:43,546
And when it comes to the matter
of eliminating Clouseau...

615
00:59:43,588 --> 00:59:47,508
nobody wants to have anybody else
get the credit for it.

616
00:59:47,592 --> 00:59:51,137
It's a matter of national pride.

617
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:54,724
I think we all agree, Mr. President,
that we simply cannot afford...

618
00:59:54,807 --> 00:59:58,394
to allow any other country
to get hold of Fassbender's machine.

619
00:59:58,436 --> 01:00:02,607
Crazy or not, anyone who has gone
to the lengths that Dreyfus has...

620
01:00:02,690 --> 01:00:04,901
in order to eliminate one man...

621
01:00:04,942 --> 01:00:07,069
it's reasonable to assume...

622
01:00:07,111 --> 01:00:09,614
that Dreyfus will smile
very kindly...

623
01:00:09,697 --> 01:00:12,742
on the one who eliminates
lnspector Clouseau.

624
01:00:12,825 --> 01:00:15,036
I think that's pretty far-fetched.

625
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:18,456
Mr. President,
if I told you one week ago...

626
01:00:18,539 --> 01:00:20,750
that the U.N. building
would disappear...

627
01:00:20,791 --> 01:00:23,961
and that a certified lunatic
would blackmail the entire...

628
01:00:24,045 --> 01:00:26,297
You made your point.
What do we do?

629
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:29,759
Well, Mr. President,
Clouseau is in Munich.

630
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:32,178
I ordered one of our top people
to Munich yesterday.

631
01:00:32,261 --> 01:00:35,723
- Yesterday?
- Well, just in case.

632
01:00:35,806 --> 01:00:39,352
He's just reported in.
Clouseau has gone to the Oktoberfest.

633
01:00:39,435 --> 01:00:42,522
I wonder if we have enough time
before the others act.

634
01:00:42,605 --> 01:00:46,692
Germany's already acted,
and bungled it.

635
01:00:46,776 --> 01:00:49,153
According to the latest
code transmission...

636
01:00:49,195 --> 01:00:51,864
twelve countries have got
their top assassins in Munich...

637
01:00:51,948 --> 01:00:54,617
and they're all converging
on the Oktoberfest.

638
01:00:56,118 --> 01:00:59,914
My God, it will be
like a shooting gallery.

639
01:02:42,433 --> 01:02:45,520
Try one of my pretzels.
They're good.

640
01:03:46,497 --> 01:03:49,500
What are you doing
to this poor, motherless child?

641
01:03:49,584 --> 01:03:51,043
You great big bully.

642
01:03:52,295 --> 01:03:55,464
There, there, little boy.

643
01:05:15,294 --> 01:05:16,754
Sir.

644
01:05:22,718 --> 01:05:24,929
- I better call the President.
- You know what time it is?

645
01:05:26,722 --> 01:05:29,058
He wants me to call.

646
01:05:30,726 --> 01:05:32,645
Put me in, Coach.

647
01:05:35,606 --> 01:05:37,525
What's the score?

648
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:47,994
Yes!

649
01:05:49,954 --> 01:05:52,874
It's okay. How many?

650
01:05:52,957 --> 01:05:54,584
Twenty-six, Mr. President.

651
01:05:54,625 --> 01:05:58,045
Holy cow. No wonder Dreyfus
wants that Clouseau killed.

652
01:05:58,129 --> 01:06:00,298
He's a one-man army.
Who's left?

653
01:06:00,381 --> 01:06:03,301
Just the Russian
and the Egyptian.

654
01:07:03,069 --> 01:07:05,029
My key, please.

655
01:07:12,829 --> 01:07:14,747
127, please.

656
01:08:38,623 --> 01:08:41,209
Good evening,
lnspector Clouseau.

657
01:08:57,391 --> 01:09:01,521
I couldn't sleep, and I just happened
to be in the neighborhood.

658
01:09:10,071 --> 01:09:12,490
I hope you don't mind.

659
01:09:27,839 --> 01:09:31,175
You Frenchmen are so romantic.

660
01:09:32,844 --> 01:09:34,929
Thank heaven

661
01:09:35,012 --> 01:09:37,348
For little girls

662
01:10:48,628 --> 01:10:50,588
Swine maid.

663
01:12:46,787 --> 01:12:49,999
Oh, forgive me, darling.
I've just washed my hands.

664
01:12:51,501 --> 01:12:53,794
They must have been freezing.

665
01:12:54,754 --> 01:12:56,130
Freezing? Yes.

666
01:12:56,214 --> 01:12:57,924
Something wrong?

667
01:12:58,007 --> 01:13:01,469
Wrong? Oh, no.

668
01:13:01,552 --> 01:13:03,221
What could be wrong?

669
01:13:05,932 --> 01:13:09,685
Then come back to bed.

670
01:13:09,769 --> 01:13:11,729
Yes, of course.

671
01:13:11,771 --> 01:13:13,940
Into the bed, you know.

672
01:13:15,066 --> 01:13:18,486
And take off
those so-silly pajamas.

673
01:13:20,404 --> 01:13:24,367
You may rest assured you will never
see these so-silly pajamas again.

674
01:13:24,450 --> 01:13:27,537
That I can assure you.

675
01:13:41,843 --> 01:13:43,261
Darling?

676
01:13:44,387 --> 01:13:47,098
Yes, I won't be a moment...

677
01:13:47,181 --> 01:13:48,599
darling.

678
01:13:50,268 --> 01:13:52,228
Hurry, darling.

679
01:13:53,479 --> 01:13:56,190
I'm just going to take a bath.

680
01:13:56,274 --> 01:13:58,526
A bath?

681
01:13:58,609 --> 01:14:00,528
Excuse me.

682
01:14:02,113 --> 01:14:03,531
Yes.

683
01:14:09,579 --> 01:14:12,290
Hello, this is
Chief lnspector Clouseau.

684
01:14:12,373 --> 01:14:15,793
There is a beautiful woman in my bed
and a dead man in my bath.

685
01:14:24,468 --> 01:14:27,722
If you're going to take a bath,
I want to take one with you.

686
01:14:28,973 --> 01:14:32,643
Darling, it's freezing out here.
Let me in.

687
01:14:38,149 --> 01:14:39,650
Madame...

688
01:14:39,734 --> 01:14:42,987
I arrest you for the murder
of the man in this bathtub.

689
01:14:43,070 --> 01:14:44,155
What?

690
01:14:44,238 --> 01:14:48,159
And I must warn you that anything
you say will be taken down...

691
01:14:48,242 --> 01:14:50,369
and used in evidence against me...

692
01:14:50,453 --> 01:14:51,996
you.

693
01:14:53,915 --> 01:14:55,833
Who is he?

694
01:14:55,917 --> 01:14:59,378
I don't know.
He looks familiar.

695
01:14:59,462 --> 01:15:02,840
- He looks like you.
- Looks like me?

696
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:07,678
Tournier, the bank robber.

697
01:15:07,762 --> 01:15:10,640
What is he doing in your bathtub
dressed up like you?

698
01:15:10,681 --> 01:15:14,060
It is a question
I could very easily ask you.

699
01:15:14,143 --> 01:15:16,521
But he has been shot...

700
01:15:16,604 --> 01:15:19,816
and I do not carry a gun.

701
01:15:19,857 --> 01:15:22,652
Obviously not, no.

702
01:15:22,735 --> 01:15:24,987
I am Olga Berriossiva.

703
01:15:25,029 --> 01:15:28,366
Until one hour ago,
I was a loyal Russian agent...

704
01:15:28,449 --> 01:15:31,661
under direct order
from the presidium to kill you.

705
01:15:31,702 --> 01:15:33,204
To kill me?

706
01:15:33,246 --> 01:15:35,665
I was considered
a perfect liquidator...

707
01:15:35,706 --> 01:15:39,335
because no man had ever been able
to involve me emotionally...

708
01:15:39,377 --> 01:15:41,337
until tonight.

709
01:15:42,713 --> 01:15:45,591
Do you think that you
could fall in love...

710
01:15:45,675 --> 01:15:48,845
with an ex-Russian agent?

711
01:15:50,471 --> 01:15:52,682
Well, of course...

712
01:15:52,765 --> 01:15:55,434
everything is possible, yes.

713
01:16:01,065 --> 01:16:03,901
- But you are not the same.
- Huh?

714
01:16:03,985 --> 01:16:07,238
Oh, well, of course...

715
01:16:07,321 --> 01:16:09,615
dead men in bathtubs
have been known...

716
01:16:09,699 --> 01:16:12,285
to make quite a difference,
you know.

717
01:16:12,368 --> 01:16:16,497
Anyway, this is the man who can
lead me to the lunatic Dreyfus...

718
01:16:16,581 --> 01:16:18,833
who it is my sworn duty
to apprehend.

719
01:16:18,916 --> 01:16:22,044
I, too, had a sworn duty,
but I have forsaken it...

720
01:16:22,128 --> 01:16:26,299
become traitor,
given up everything for you.

721
01:16:27,884 --> 01:16:29,177
With me...

722
01:16:29,260 --> 01:16:32,555
it is the duty that comes first.

723
01:16:32,597 --> 01:16:36,225
Oh, make an exception
just this once.

724
01:16:36,309 --> 01:16:38,644
I wish that I could.

725
01:16:38,728 --> 01:16:41,814
You can. I guarantee it.

726
01:16:41,898 --> 01:16:44,609
No, you see, l...

727
01:16:45,776 --> 01:16:47,361
- Look!
- What?

728
01:16:47,445 --> 01:16:51,115
That tattoo. When I arrested Tournier,
he did not have that tattoo.

729
01:16:51,199 --> 01:16:55,411
- It looks like the Mondschien crest.
- Mondschien?

730
01:16:55,495 --> 01:16:57,830
- Mm-hmm.
- What is that?

731
01:16:57,914 --> 01:17:01,584
An infamous family who ruled Bavaria
in the 15th century.

732
01:17:02,752 --> 01:17:06,631
I read somewhere
that the Mondschien Castle...

733
01:17:06,714 --> 01:17:09,675
had recently been sold.

734
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:11,844
You read somewhere that...

735
01:17:11,928 --> 01:17:14,305
they had sold the castle?

736
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:21,103
Fancy them selling the castle,
just like that.

737
01:17:26,108 --> 01:17:28,027
The castle!

738
01:17:28,110 --> 01:17:30,613
Yes. Dreyfus.

739
01:17:31,697 --> 01:17:34,617
He is in the castle.

740
01:17:41,999 --> 01:17:45,086
Farewell. I am off
to Mondschien Castle.

741
01:17:58,724 --> 01:18:01,811
Must be getting a cavity.

742
01:18:01,853 --> 01:18:04,438
When can my daughter and I leave?

743
01:18:04,522 --> 01:18:07,608
When Clouseau is no more,
perhaps.

744
01:18:07,692 --> 01:18:10,069
I have done
everything you asked.

745
01:18:10,153 --> 01:18:12,989
You've done everything I've asked
so far...

746
01:18:13,030 --> 01:18:15,408
but I have not asked everything.

747
01:18:15,491 --> 01:18:18,369
What you mean is that you have
no intention of letting us go.

748
01:18:18,411 --> 01:18:20,538
You plan to continue
your reign of terror...

749
01:18:20,621 --> 01:18:22,707
whether Clouseau is eliminated
or not.

750
01:18:22,790 --> 01:18:25,001
I must admit the thought
had occurred to me.

751
01:18:25,084 --> 01:18:28,796
- You are mad.
- And you are redundant, Professor.

752
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:31,841
Redundant and fallacious.
Madness does not preclude achievement.

753
01:18:31,924 --> 01:18:34,677
You cannot operate the machine
without me.

754
01:18:34,719 --> 01:18:36,762
Not yet,
but when you have taught me.

755
01:18:36,846 --> 01:18:38,931
And if I refuse to teach you?

756
01:18:39,015 --> 01:18:43,686
Then I would have to take the matter up
with your charming daughter.

757
01:18:43,769 --> 01:18:46,564
- What kind of a man are you?
- A madman.

758
01:18:46,647 --> 01:18:50,735
- You said so yourself.
- Boss!

759
01:18:59,243 --> 01:19:01,496
It's true.

760
01:19:01,579 --> 01:19:03,998
- When?
- This morning, in his hotel room.

761
01:19:05,917 --> 01:19:08,336
He's dead!

762
01:19:08,419 --> 01:19:11,464
He's dead
in his hotel bedroom!

763
01:19:11,547 --> 01:19:13,466
Hurray! I'm free!

764
01:19:14,967 --> 01:19:18,012
Oh, I'm so happy, Professor.

765
01:19:18,095 --> 01:19:19,514
I'm so...

766
01:19:40,785 --> 01:19:42,787
Good day.

767
01:19:42,870 --> 01:19:45,456
My name is Professor Guy Gabroir...

768
01:19:45,540 --> 01:19:48,626
medieval castle authority
from Marseilles.

769
01:19:48,709 --> 01:19:52,630
Tell me, do you have a room?

770
01:19:52,713 --> 01:19:56,384
I do not know
what a "reum" is.

771
01:20:07,979 --> 01:20:10,773
Ah! A room!

772
01:20:10,815 --> 01:20:13,151
That is what I have
been saying, you idiot.

773
01:20:13,234 --> 01:20:14,652
Room.

774
01:20:32,003 --> 01:20:33,713
Does your dog bite?

775
01:20:39,177 --> 01:20:40,595
Nice doggy.

776
01:20:44,056 --> 01:20:46,392
I thought you said
your dog did not bite.

777
01:20:46,476 --> 01:20:48,978
That is not my dog.

778
01:24:01,420 --> 01:24:03,965
Anything I can get you, boss?

779
01:24:04,048 --> 01:24:07,051
I can't stand it any longer.
Get me a dentist!

780
01:24:23,693 --> 01:24:25,987
Dr. Shurtz lives here...

781
01:24:26,070 --> 01:24:28,489
but he has gone fishing.

782
01:24:29,740 --> 01:24:33,327
I don't know.
I will tell him.

783
01:24:35,371 --> 01:24:38,666
Did I hear you say
a doctor lives here?

784
01:24:38,749 --> 01:24:41,586
He's a doctor and a dentist.

785
01:24:41,627 --> 01:24:43,963
He made mein teeth for me.

786
01:24:44,046 --> 01:24:47,008
They want him up at the castle.

787
01:24:47,091 --> 01:24:50,928
Up at the castle?
Where can I find him?

788
01:24:51,012 --> 01:24:53,639
Dr. Shurtz has gone fishing.

789
01:24:53,723 --> 01:24:56,767
- He probably won't be back until...
- Show me his zimmer.

790
01:24:56,851 --> 01:24:58,144
- Hmm?
- His room!

791
01:25:12,450 --> 01:25:14,827
Hello!

792
01:25:14,911 --> 01:25:18,789
It's Dr. Shurtz
from the village, you know.

793
01:25:43,481 --> 01:25:46,359
Oh, excuse me, sir.

794
01:25:46,442 --> 01:25:48,736
- Dr. Shurtz is here.
- Where?

795
01:25:48,820 --> 01:25:51,113
Ah, here, Doctor.
Please hurry.

796
01:25:51,155 --> 01:25:53,115
I am in agony.

797
01:25:56,661 --> 01:25:59,121
All will be well soon.

798
01:26:00,915 --> 01:26:03,292
- Did you hurt yourself?
- Yes.

799
01:26:03,334 --> 01:26:06,045
The burn.
I can set it later.

800
01:26:07,505 --> 01:26:10,049
- Please hurry.
- First of all, I will need...

801
01:26:10,133 --> 01:26:12,176
some hot water and towels.

802
01:26:12,260 --> 01:26:15,179
Get some hot water, Harry,
and lock the door.

803
01:26:15,263 --> 01:26:18,474
- I don't want to be disturbed.
- And lock the door, Harry.

804
01:26:18,516 --> 01:26:20,810
He does not wish
to be disturbed, you know.

805
01:26:20,893 --> 01:26:24,147
Please, Doctor, hurry.
I can't stand the pain.

806
01:26:24,230 --> 01:26:27,650
Yes. Now, then let me see.

807
01:26:27,692 --> 01:26:29,527
- Ow.
- What?

808
01:26:29,610 --> 01:26:32,488
- My eye.
- I thought it was your tooth.

809
01:26:32,530 --> 01:26:35,700
- But it is my tooth.
- I wish you would make your mind up.

810
01:26:35,783 --> 01:26:39,328
I don't normally make castle calls
in the middle of the night.

811
01:26:43,958 --> 01:26:45,376
Doctor.

812
01:26:47,044 --> 01:26:48,963
Wait while l...

813
01:26:51,257 --> 01:26:52,925
Yes, that's...

814
01:26:57,263 --> 01:26:58,514
There it is.

815
01:27:00,558 --> 01:27:03,436
Now, open wide, please.

816
01:27:04,896 --> 01:27:06,856
Now, let me see.

817
01:27:08,357 --> 01:27:11,360
Tell me when this hurts.

818
01:27:11,402 --> 01:27:13,362
Is it that one?

819
01:27:14,655 --> 01:27:16,574
Is it that one?

820
01:27:19,076 --> 01:27:21,787
Ah, there is the naughty one.

821
01:27:21,871 --> 01:27:24,916
- Are you going to pull it?
- Pull it?

822
01:27:24,999 --> 01:27:27,460
Yes, of course I will pull it.

823
01:27:27,543 --> 01:27:30,087
Please give me something
to put me out.

824
01:27:30,171 --> 01:27:32,089
Put you out?

825
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:35,760
Yes. Here, first you must wear...

826
01:27:35,802 --> 01:27:39,555
this special anesthetic
cotton wool, you know.

827
01:27:39,597 --> 01:27:44,310
Wear it over the eyes.
On no account look out from under it.

828
01:27:44,393 --> 01:27:48,064
That will ruin the whole effect
of the anesthetic on the eyes.

829
01:27:48,105 --> 01:27:51,651
- You want me to hold it like that?
- Hold it like that on the eyes...

830
01:27:51,734 --> 01:27:53,736
while I get some...

831
01:27:53,820 --> 01:27:56,489
Please hurry, Doctor.
I can't stand the pain.

832
01:27:56,572 --> 01:27:58,491
Yes. Coming soon.

833
01:28:06,749 --> 01:28:08,668
What are you doing?

834
01:28:08,751 --> 01:28:11,420
Just rearranging the furniture...

835
01:28:11,462 --> 01:28:15,258
in order to give you
the full effect of the anesthetic.

836
01:28:15,299 --> 01:28:18,845
Doctor, I'm in agony!

837
01:28:18,928 --> 01:28:21,180
Not for much longer.

838
01:28:34,318 --> 01:28:36,779
That was hell down there.

839
01:28:36,821 --> 01:28:39,615
What's wrong?

840
01:28:39,699 --> 01:28:43,703
Whoever built this house
put the stairs in the wrong place.

841
01:28:43,786 --> 01:28:47,039
Do you mean
you fell down the stairs?

842
01:28:47,123 --> 01:28:50,459
I was preoccupied
with the anesthetic, you know.

843
01:28:50,501 --> 01:28:53,629
It's really hot in here,
isn't it?

844
01:28:56,215 --> 01:28:58,176
Now, the...

845
01:28:59,218 --> 01:29:00,678
anesthetic.

846
01:29:04,182 --> 01:29:06,142
"Nitrous oxide."

847
01:29:08,561 --> 01:29:11,063
What's that?

848
01:29:11,147 --> 01:29:13,858
That is the anesthetic,
you know.

849
01:29:13,941 --> 01:29:15,359
Oh, good.

850
01:29:16,444 --> 01:29:19,155
Yes, it is good, yes.

851
01:29:21,240 --> 01:29:23,868
Please, Doctor,
the pain is getting worse.

852
01:29:23,951 --> 01:29:26,120
Please, hurry up.

853
01:29:26,204 --> 01:29:30,082
A few whiffs of this,
and you won't feel a thing.

854
01:29:31,167 --> 01:29:34,837
- All right.
- Now, breathe deeply.

855
01:29:36,047 --> 01:29:39,175
- How's that?
- It's fine.

856
01:29:39,217 --> 01:29:41,177
How do you feel?

857
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:44,680
A little dizzy.

858
01:29:46,432 --> 01:29:48,976
- What's so funny?
- I don't know. Nothing.

859
01:29:49,060 --> 01:29:51,687
- Then why are you laughing?
- I don't know.

860
01:29:51,771 --> 01:29:55,733
- Why are you laughing?
- Because I can't help it.

861
01:30:07,286 --> 01:30:08,746
Yes.

862
01:30:12,416 --> 01:30:13,543
I love it.

863
01:30:13,626 --> 01:30:15,670
- Come on.
- It's gonna hurt.

864
01:30:15,753 --> 01:30:17,672
Good. Lovely.

865
01:30:33,813 --> 01:30:37,525
I will have to use more leverage.

866
01:31:02,008 --> 01:31:04,635
I don't know what you gave me,
Doctor...

867
01:31:04,719 --> 01:31:07,513
but it's giving me hallucinations.

868
01:31:07,597 --> 01:31:10,516
Your whole face has changed.

869
01:31:10,600 --> 01:31:12,518
It has?

870
01:31:24,822 --> 01:31:26,324
How's this?

871
01:31:26,407 --> 01:31:28,826
Grotesque!

872
01:31:32,955 --> 01:31:35,666
We just got word, boss.
Clouseau is still alive.

873
01:31:38,503 --> 01:31:40,463
I knew it.

874
01:31:45,676 --> 01:31:48,513
He has pulled the wrong tooth.

875
01:31:50,723 --> 01:31:54,977
There's only one man
who would pull the wrong tooth.

876
01:31:55,019 --> 01:31:56,646
It's Clouseau.

877
01:31:56,729 --> 01:31:59,482
Kill him.

878
01:32:23,798 --> 01:32:27,343
Get Fassbender and his daughter
into the control room.

879
01:32:27,385 --> 01:32:29,512
What about Clouseau?

880
01:32:29,554 --> 01:32:34,016
Priorities.
First I will pick a target.

881
01:32:34,058 --> 01:32:36,018
Then Clouseau.

882
01:32:54,704 --> 01:32:57,456
Now we'll see
who has the last laugh.

883
01:32:57,540 --> 01:32:59,792
They've all betrayed me,
and now they will have to pay.

884
01:32:59,876 --> 01:33:02,795
What shall I destroy?
Buckingham Palace? Too small.

885
01:33:02,879 --> 01:33:04,797
How about London?
Not big enough.

886
01:33:04,881 --> 01:33:07,383
England! Yes, England.

887
01:33:07,467 --> 01:33:09,427
Good-bye, Piccadilly

888
01:33:09,469 --> 01:33:12,054
Farewell, Leicester Square

889
01:33:19,061 --> 01:33:21,731
You are just in time,
Professor.

890
01:33:21,814 --> 01:33:25,610
Within five minutes,
I shall destroy England.

891
01:33:25,693 --> 01:33:27,612
England!

892
01:33:27,695 --> 01:33:30,156
No more cricket.

893
01:33:30,239 --> 01:33:33,117
No more warm beer, Professor.

894
01:33:33,159 --> 01:33:36,662
No more fish and chips.
No more...

895
01:33:44,837 --> 01:33:46,297
England!

896
01:34:44,230 --> 01:34:45,731
Do something.

897
01:34:45,815 --> 01:34:48,192
You brought it on yourself.
It's too late.

898
01:34:48,276 --> 01:34:49,527
Wait!

899
01:34:49,610 --> 01:34:52,572
Do something!
Come back! Help me!

900
01:34:52,655 --> 01:34:54,073
Look!

901
01:34:56,033 --> 01:34:57,660
You've gotta help me.

902
01:34:57,702 --> 01:35:00,872
Help, Professor!

903
01:36:37,635 --> 01:36:40,638
Cato, my little yellow friend,
I'm home.

904
01:37:19,427 --> 01:37:21,929
I gave Cato the night off.

905
01:37:23,306 --> 01:37:27,018
But what has happened
to my room?

906
01:40:00,087 --> 01:40:01,506
Darling?

907
01:40:13,726 --> 01:40:16,270
My darling.

908
01:40:21,317 --> 01:40:23,986
Darling, sing to me.

909
01:40:24,028 --> 01:40:26,656
Sing to you? Oh.

910
01:40:26,739 --> 01:40:30,243
Come to me

911
01:40:30,326 --> 01:40:32,245
And the world

912
01:40:32,328 --> 01:40:35,998
It will be ours tonight

913
01:40:44,549 --> 01:40:46,509
Where did you go?

914
01:40:46,592 --> 01:40:49,387
- Your voice?
- Yes, that was my voice.

915
01:40:49,470 --> 01:40:52,181
That was my voice singing
a little song we used to sing...

916
01:40:52,223 --> 01:40:55,434
in the Resistance
to keep up the courage.

917
01:40:55,518 --> 01:40:58,479
Was it hard for you
in the Resistance?

918
01:40:58,563 --> 01:41:02,400
Very hard, but not as hard
as it is now.

919
01:41:02,483 --> 01:41:04,402
Darling, relax.

920
01:41:04,485 --> 01:41:06,988
Resistance is over.

921
01:41:08,281 --> 01:41:10,825
My darling.

922
01:41:10,908 --> 01:41:13,077
My beautiful darling.

923
01:41:13,161 --> 01:41:15,329
What?
