00:00:47,856 --> 00:00:49,824
(car door opens)

2
00:00:49,858 --> 00:00:52,258
(keys rattle)

3
00:00:52,293 --> 00:00:53,817
(opera music playing)

4
00:00:53,862 --> 00:00:55,887
(bottle uncorking,
pouring)

5
00:00:57,765 --> 00:00:59,926
(sipping)

6
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:03,153
(opera fades)

00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,613
(train horn honking)

00:02:32,593 --> 00:02:33,924
(cows moo)

00:02:35,396 --> 00:02:36,693
(honking)

10
00:02:36,731 --> 00:02:38,528
- Hey.
- (honking)

00:02:38,566 --> 00:02:40,557

Department
of Public Safety.

13
00:03:17,271 --> 00:03:19,068
(knocking)

14
00:03:19,107 --> 00:03:20,768
Mr. Dennison?

15
00:03:24,912 --> 00:03:27,142
Vincent Dennison is
a registered sex offender.

16
00:03:27,181 --> 00:03:28,808
The sooner I can
verify his address,

17
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:30,477
the sooner I can
leave him alone.

18
00:03:30,518 --> 00:03:31,883
(door opens)

19
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:35,878
- You've been here for...
- A year and a half.

20
00:03:35,923 --> 00:03:39,950
Have you used any aliases
in the past six months?

21
00:03:39,994 --> 00:03:42,121
- No.
- "No."

22
00:03:42,163 --> 00:03:44,859
(TV playing low)

23
00:03:44,899 --> 00:03:47,265
What do you do?

24
00:03:49,003 --> 00:03:50,800
I mean, for fun.
Just...

25
00:03:50,838 --> 00:03:52,305
Go to church.

26
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,739
I attend
a support group.

27
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:56,300
Uh-huh. What kind
of support group?

28
00:03:56,344 --> 00:03:57,834
Come on, man,
you know.

29
00:04:00,882 --> 00:04:03,908
What do you think about,
Vincent?

30
00:04:03,951 --> 00:04:06,385
I mean sexual thoughts.

31
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:12,024
- I don't know.
- Come on.

32
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,187
Everyone has
sexual thoughts.

33
00:04:14,228 --> 00:04:16,025
You ain't supposed
to ask me that.

34
00:04:16,064 --> 00:04:18,191
That's not on
the questionnaire.

35
00:04:18,232 --> 00:04:19,859
You're right.

36
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:27,236
- How've your moods been?
- Good.

37
00:04:27,275 --> 00:04:29,209
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

38
00:04:29,243 --> 00:04:31,211
You taking
your medication?

39
00:04:31,245 --> 00:04:33,873
- Yeah.
- Good. It's important to do that.

40
00:04:36,184 --> 00:04:39,244
Any feelings that might
lead you to do something

41
00:04:39,287 --> 00:04:40,914
you don't want to do?

42
00:04:40,955 --> 00:04:42,718
No.

43
00:04:44,725 --> 00:04:47,387
How would you cope
with a feeling

44
00:04:47,428 --> 00:04:50,226
that might lead you
to stray?

45
00:04:51,466 --> 00:04:54,731
I'll settle down
with a nice girl.

46
00:04:56,137 --> 00:04:58,662
Does that sound realistic
to you, Vincent?

47
00:04:58,706 --> 00:05:00,674
I don't know.

48
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:04,371
What do you think about
when you masturbate?

49
00:05:06,714 --> 00:05:08,978
You think about settling
down with a nice girl?

50
00:05:09,016 --> 00:05:12,884
Or you think about
holding her down?

51
00:05:15,456 --> 00:05:18,254
(moaning)

52
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:22,685
(grunts)

53
00:05:23,731 --> 00:05:25,926
(opera playing)

54
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:43,213
(bat cracks)

55
00:06:15,716 --> 00:06:17,377
Man:
Morning.

56
00:06:28,529 --> 00:06:32,021
(people chattering)

57
00:06:32,066 --> 00:06:34,057
Man:
She starts today.

58
00:06:34,101 --> 00:06:36,433
You'll be sharing
a desk and a car.

59
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:38,938
Oh, good good good good.
Good.

60
00:06:38,973 --> 00:06:41,066
- You want to meet her?
- You know I got another month, right?

61
00:06:41,108 --> 00:06:43,804
- (clicks intercom)
- Send in Allison, please.

62
00:06:43,844 --> 00:06:46,904
You can retire
right this minute if you want to.

63
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,916
- You've earned it.
- No. No, Bobby, no.

64
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,578
No, I have not
earned this.

65
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:53,348
- Mmm.
- (door opens)

66
00:06:53,387 --> 00:06:56,254
- Hi.
- Allison Lowry,

67
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,588
this is Errol Babbage.

68
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:01,186
Mr. Babbage,
it's a pleasure to meet you.

69
00:07:01,229 --> 00:07:03,925
Yeah, no need to be so wonderful.
You got the job...

70
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,956
- apparently.
- Errol,

71
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,798
would you excuse us
for a moment, please?

72
00:07:08,836 --> 00:07:10,633
Surely, yeah.

73
00:07:10,671 --> 00:07:13,834
Okay.
Good, very good.

74
00:07:17,845 --> 00:07:20,871
Usually, I'd ask
a seasoned guy like Errol

75
00:07:20,915 --> 00:07:23,213
to help you
stay out of trouble.

76
00:07:23,251 --> 00:07:24,616
In this situation,

77
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,517
things are the other
way around.

78
00:07:40,034 --> 00:07:41,365
(drawer slams open)

79
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,007
Any questions,
just ask.

80
00:07:54,048 --> 00:07:55,811
Thank you.

81
00:08:00,154 --> 00:08:02,520
You're not gonna learn
anything from them...

82
00:08:02,556 --> 00:08:04,217
except how
to keep your job.

83
00:08:04,258 --> 00:08:07,227
That's yours. This is your desk.
Move that over if you want.

84
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,900
- You coming?
- Oh, yeah.

85
00:08:17,338 --> 00:08:20,330
We have a young man who just
moved here from out of state.

86
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:22,342
- What did he do?
- Rape.

87
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:24,537
Second degree,
plea bargain.

88
00:08:24,578 --> 00:08:27,775
I don't care what he did.
I care what he's gonna do.

89
00:08:27,815 --> 00:08:30,943
You know, these people
are registered as a...

90
00:08:30,985 --> 00:08:32,452
as a courtesy
to the public,

91
00:08:32,486 --> 00:08:35,717
to the victims, to the people who
testified against them.

92
00:08:35,756 --> 00:08:39,817
Also because... because of what
they're capable of...

93
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,761
- Mm-hm.
...because of their potential.

94
00:08:42,797 --> 00:08:45,197
Registering them is one thing,
but telling the future,

95
00:08:45,232 --> 00:08:47,723
that's... that's
something else.

96
00:08:47,768 --> 00:08:50,396
We're fortune tellers.

97
00:08:50,438 --> 00:08:53,999
Predict wrong,
people die.

98
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:56,942
(elevator dings)

99
00:08:58,312 --> 00:09:00,610
I was misunderstood.

100
00:09:00,648 --> 00:09:03,481
The male is more sexually
aggressive by nature.

101
00:09:03,517 --> 00:09:06,384
It's a way of passing on
their genetic material.

102
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,910
(scoffs)

103
00:09:07,955 --> 00:09:10,048
"Misunderstood."

104
00:09:11,892 --> 00:09:14,622
His mother couldn't
buy her off is what happened.

105
00:09:14,662 --> 00:09:16,186
Like she did with
all the others.

106
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:19,165
- What's your name, hon?
- Beatrice Bell.

107
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,192
- What was it? Beatrice Bell? Nice.
- Beatrice Bell.

108
00:09:22,236 --> 00:09:25,137
So tell me,
Beatrice Bell,

109
00:09:25,172 --> 00:09:28,107
how often does Edmund here

110
00:09:28,142 --> 00:09:30,474
pass on his
genetic material?

111
00:09:31,812 --> 00:09:34,212
- I don't know.
- Mm-hmm.

112
00:09:34,248 --> 00:09:35,875
Sometimes too often?

113
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:40,216
Sometimes when
things don't...

114
00:09:40,254 --> 00:09:42,620
quite function...

115
00:09:42,656 --> 00:09:44,954
right,
you get the blame?

116
00:09:44,992 --> 00:09:46,289
(laughs)

117
00:09:46,327 --> 00:09:48,955
I don't think
this is appropriate.

118
00:09:48,996 --> 00:09:51,294
Then maybe you
should wait outside.

119
00:09:58,272 --> 00:10:01,366
You know, you can call me
when you've had enough of this guy.

120
00:10:01,409 --> 00:10:03,434
I'll help you get rid of him.
Okay?

121
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:08,080
Hey.

122
00:10:08,115 --> 00:10:09,673
What's that?

123
00:10:09,717 --> 00:10:11,344
Did you do this?

124
00:10:11,385 --> 00:10:12,852
You guys finished
with the survey?

125
00:10:12,887 --> 00:10:14,411
- Did you do this?
- And by the way, I brush...

126
00:10:14,455 --> 00:10:17,913
Hey, did you do this?

127
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,369
You're a hitter,
aren't you?

128
00:10:31,405 --> 00:10:33,737
Likes the sound of knuckles
on a woman's body.

129
00:10:33,774 --> 00:10:34,900
(scoffs)

130
00:10:34,942 --> 00:10:37,103
Maybe she enjoys it.

131
00:10:37,144 --> 00:10:39,635
Maybe I do too.

132
00:10:43,217 --> 00:10:45,447
Okay, well, hey.

133
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,884
All right, Edmund, okay.

134
00:10:50,925 --> 00:10:54,292
I'm just coming... I'm here
to welcome you to the state.

135
00:10:54,328 --> 00:10:57,627
So, welcome.

136
00:11:07,308 --> 00:11:09,071
What are you circling?

137
00:11:09,109 --> 00:11:10,542
I keep track of offenses

138
00:11:10,578 --> 00:11:13,138
that might have been committed
by one of my people.

139
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,512
If a pattern develops,

140
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:18,109
or something occurs to me
that could help the police,

141
00:11:18,152 --> 00:11:19,847
I pass it on.

142
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:22,754
Those questions
weren't on the form.

143
00:11:25,926 --> 00:11:27,985
Mr. Babbage?

144
00:11:28,028 --> 00:11:29,689
They were invasive.

145
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:34,296
Compulsive rapists,
opportunistic rapists,

146
00:11:34,335 --> 00:11:37,031
armpit rapists,
date rapists,

147
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:39,039
fetishists,
exhibitionists,

148
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:41,439
frotteurs,
molesters of animals,

149
00:11:41,475 --> 00:11:44,137
molesters of children...

150
00:11:44,178 --> 00:11:47,079
You better tell me now
if you're too squeamish for this job.

151
00:11:47,114 --> 00:11:49,173
Call your mother,
have her come pick you up.

152
00:11:52,419 --> 00:11:54,410
So what are you
gonna do now?

153
00:11:54,455 --> 00:11:55,888
I mean, when you retire?

154
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:58,687
I'm not retiring.

155
00:11:58,726 --> 00:12:01,354
I'm being let go.

156
00:12:04,665 --> 00:12:06,758
You could use
a new look.

157
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,701
Get some of that hair
out of your face.

158
00:12:09,737 --> 00:12:11,602
I'll get the check.

159
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:14,073
Don't worry, the department's
paying for this.

160
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:20,205
Errol:
"Next registrant:

161
00:12:20,247 --> 00:12:23,148
Unlawful imprisonment,
attempted sexual battery,

162
00:12:23,183 --> 00:12:24,172
three counts..."

163
00:12:24,218 --> 00:12:25,947
- Sit up, please.
- Did two years.

164
00:12:25,986 --> 00:12:28,682
Could have been much worse,
except for the plea bargain.

165
00:12:28,722 --> 00:12:30,917
Partner executed in August.

166
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,516
For attempted battery?

167
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,152
- No, murder.
- This way, please.

168
00:12:34,194 --> 00:12:37,322
Yep, they slowly
mutilated these women

169
00:12:37,364 --> 00:12:39,229
till they died...
took over a week.

170
00:12:39,266 --> 00:12:41,894
And then they
cut off their feet,

171
00:12:41,936 --> 00:12:44,302
their legs, their hands
their arms,

172
00:12:44,338 --> 00:12:46,329
their tongues,
their ears,

173
00:12:46,373 --> 00:12:48,841
- and their hair.
- Jesus.

174
00:12:48,876 --> 00:12:51,504
It was all over the news.
The one executed is Paul Gerard.

175
00:12:51,545 --> 00:12:53,513
Partner who rolled on him
was his wife.

176
00:12:53,547 --> 00:12:56,380
We're talking about
Paul Gerard's wife?

177
00:12:56,417 --> 00:12:59,818
Well, she's using
her maiden name now.

178
00:12:59,853 --> 00:13:01,150
Aren't you, Viola?

179
00:13:01,188 --> 00:13:02,553
- (scissors snip)
- Ow!

180
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,751
- (sighs)
- Sorry.

181
00:13:04,792 --> 00:13:06,453
You okay?

182
00:13:10,564 --> 00:13:14,227
Ah, Viola is my favorite
registrant, aren't you, Viola?

183
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:18,134
You should let me do
something about that gray.

184
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:20,037
You're never
touching me.

185
00:13:20,074 --> 00:13:22,235
You can take care
of the registration.

186
00:13:22,276 --> 00:13:24,267
I got a couple
things to do.

187
00:13:25,312 --> 00:13:27,075
(door opens,
bells ding)

188
00:13:27,114 --> 00:13:28,979
- (door slams)
- He enjoyed that.

189
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:40,987
So, um, how long
have you worked here?

190
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:45,328
A week longer than that last time
I was asked that question.

191
00:13:54,942 --> 00:13:57,137
What's wrong?

192
00:14:01,849 --> 00:14:05,979
I was as much a victim
as those women.

193
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,920
I'm not here
to go over that.

194
00:14:07,955 --> 00:14:10,253
Paul would try out
behavior on me,

195
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:14,292
things he...

196
00:14:14,328 --> 00:14:17,297
later did to those three.

197
00:14:17,331 --> 00:14:19,162
He...

198
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:20,860
(sighs)

199
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:25,395
he crept up behind me and
grabbed me around my neck.

200
00:14:27,775 --> 00:14:31,541
I was told
to widen my eyes...

201
00:14:32,546 --> 00:14:35,640
just so...

202
00:14:35,683 --> 00:14:37,776
in surprise.

203
00:14:38,852 --> 00:14:42,253
Then...

204
00:14:42,289 --> 00:14:45,190
he'd...

205
00:14:45,225 --> 00:14:47,591
drag me off
to the bedroom

206
00:14:47,628 --> 00:14:50,825
where he'd smother me
with a plastic bag.

207
00:14:50,864 --> 00:14:53,025
The only reason
I'm alive...

208
00:14:53,067 --> 00:14:56,901
is because my death
would have led to him.

209
00:14:58,672 --> 00:15:01,436
He didn't kill me.

210
00:15:01,475 --> 00:15:03,500
He killed who I was.

211
00:15:08,182 --> 00:15:11,413
(sighs)
Usually, Mr. Babbage

212
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:13,613
comes to my home...

213
00:15:13,654 --> 00:15:16,748
three, four times a month.

214
00:15:18,225 --> 00:15:21,092
- What does he want?
- Same questions...

215
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:23,722
over and over.

216
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:28,400
I'll make sure that he...
he leaves you alone.

217
00:15:28,435 --> 00:15:31,199
And I'll be doing
things differently.

218
00:15:31,238 --> 00:15:33,229
(mower blowing)

219
00:15:39,947 --> 00:15:41,676
(horn blaring)

220
00:15:41,715 --> 00:15:44,548
Errol: Did she say
I saw her last week?

221
00:15:45,586 --> 00:15:47,554
Yes.

222
00:15:47,588 --> 00:15:49,579
Did she say she
was innocent?

223
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:56,257
Did she say she got off on what
her husband did to those ladies?

224
00:15:57,831 --> 00:16:00,698
I can't tell if you're
just green or indifferent.

225
00:16:00,734 --> 00:16:02,964
Is indifference the same
as wishing you'd come up for air

226
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:04,630
once in a while?

227
00:16:04,671 --> 00:16:07,435
I've got 18 days to teach you
everything I can.

228
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,488
Errol:
I want you to see something,

229
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,086
feel something.

230
00:16:29,129 --> 00:16:32,860
This is Viola's
childhood farm.

231
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,868
Now she says
she was the victim?

232
00:16:34,902 --> 00:16:37,632
This is where
the real victims suffered.

233
00:16:37,671 --> 00:16:40,105
Three girls
known murdered.

234
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,631
Three other girls disappeared
about the same time

235
00:16:42,676 --> 00:16:44,405
she and Paul were caught.

236
00:16:44,444 --> 00:16:46,708
Tried to get her
to confess,

237
00:16:46,747 --> 00:16:50,114
take me to where
they buried them.

238
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:53,586
I want to give
their folks some peace.

239
00:17:00,427 --> 00:17:03,590
I've always suspected
their bones

240
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:06,098
scattered all over
these fields.

241
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:25,979
(brakes squeal)

242
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,820
This isn't a registrant.

243
00:17:34,962 --> 00:17:37,453
Yeah, the daughter disappeared
from a college campus

244
00:17:37,497 --> 00:17:39,124
six years ago.

245
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:41,691
I always suspected
Paul and Viola.

246
00:17:41,735 --> 00:17:44,295
Don't tell them
I got fired.

247
00:17:48,909 --> 00:17:51,810
Errol's visits
are difficult for me,

248
00:17:53,046 --> 00:17:57,380
but Ann seems to find
some comfort in them.

249
00:17:57,417 --> 00:17:59,544
I'm grateful to him
for that.

250
00:18:01,588 --> 00:18:03,783
That's her.
That's Abigail.

251
00:18:03,824 --> 00:18:08,056
- She's pretty.
- Mm-hmm.

252
00:18:08,095 --> 00:18:09,960
We don't know
what happened.

253
00:18:11,498 --> 00:18:15,195
Errol's the only one who promised
we would one day.

254
00:18:15,235 --> 00:18:17,226
That we'd know.

255
00:18:18,372 --> 00:18:20,431
The only one.

256
00:18:46,099 --> 00:18:48,863
Why are we staying here?
We're just a couple hours from home.

257
00:18:48,902 --> 00:18:50,335
We're not going home.

258
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:52,838
I have a little light
reading for you.

259
00:18:52,873 --> 00:18:55,535
Oh, and if I didn't
already tell you,

260
00:18:55,575 --> 00:18:57,975
always remember
to carry a fresh shirt.

261
00:18:58,011 --> 00:19:00,036
Very important.

262
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:18,921
(door closes)

263
00:19:21,468 --> 00:19:24,904
(door closes,
engine starts)

264
00:19:42,155 --> 00:19:44,316
(all chatting)

265
00:20:17,457 --> 00:20:19,118
- (grunting)
- Oh!

266
00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:23,323
- (grunting)
- (horn honking)

267
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,330
Welcome.

268
00:20:31,004 --> 00:20:32,631
(woman screeches)

269
00:20:32,672 --> 00:20:34,367
I'll have the nacho rapists,

270
00:20:34,408 --> 00:20:36,467
- the buffalo wing rapists...
- (woman giggles)

271
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,774
the molesters of fried
mozzarella with some...

272
00:20:38,812 --> 00:20:41,576
rib fetishists.
I circled them all for you.

273
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:44,277
(all laughing)

274
00:20:46,086 --> 00:20:48,418
- Hey, here's to Errol!
- All: To Errol!

275
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:50,013
Where is Errol, by the way?

276
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:54,920
(panting)

277
00:21:14,514 --> 00:21:17,176
(car pulling up)

278
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:27,183
Where'd you go
last night?

279
00:21:27,227 --> 00:21:28,717
(chuckles)

280
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:33,563
Did you look
in that book I gave you?

281
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,124
Yes.

282
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:37,466
Good, because I want you
to always remember

283
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:40,064
people like Paul and Viola
Gerard don't just tell lies,

284
00:21:40,107 --> 00:21:42,541
they are lies.

285
00:21:42,576 --> 00:21:46,808
In public, they're decent,
socially-responsible folk

286
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,439
who look you in the eye,

287
00:21:48,482 --> 00:21:50,848
but never long enough
to make you uncomfortable.

288
00:21:50,884 --> 00:21:53,318
They shake your hand,
pat you on the back,

289
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:55,583
but never overdo it.

290
00:21:55,622 --> 00:21:58,250
They're Christian if you are,
they swear if you do,

291
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:00,486
and they do this because
people like you

292
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:03,519
wrongly believe
that public presentation

293
00:22:03,563 --> 00:22:05,531
tells us all about
private lives.

294
00:22:05,565 --> 00:22:09,262
It tells us nothing.
It hides everything.

295
00:22:09,302 --> 00:22:11,998
And what about you,
Mr. Babbage?

296
00:22:12,038 --> 00:22:14,006
Tell me about
your double life.

297
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,702
What do you think about?

298
00:22:16,743 --> 00:22:21,077
I think about a girl
who didn't come home,

299
00:22:21,114 --> 00:22:23,014
what I might have missed,

300
00:22:23,049 --> 00:22:26,177
and if I miss something again,
who's next?

301
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:33,825
(neighs)

302
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:52,801
That's a good boy.

303
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:06,055
- (hoofbeats)
- Girl: Bye, Harriet. See you tomorrow.

304
00:23:06,092 --> 00:23:07,684
See ya.

305
00:23:10,964 --> 00:23:12,932
(train whistle blows)

306
00:23:12,966 --> 00:23:15,366
(crossing bells dinging)

307
00:23:29,149 --> 00:23:31,640
(Harriet screaming)

308
00:23:39,192 --> 00:23:41,251
Errol: This next
registrant's a fellow

309
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:43,262
by the name
of Glenn Custis.

310
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:45,161
He's turned his
perversions into a business.

311
00:23:45,198 --> 00:23:47,996
He's a pornographer...
movies, magazines.

312
00:23:48,034 --> 00:23:50,127
He also runs
a little dominion.

313
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:52,604
- What's a dominion?
- (huffs) You'll see.

314
00:24:00,614 --> 00:24:02,605
(film projector rolling)

315
00:24:10,557 --> 00:24:13,390
Why don't you look down that way?
I'll go this way.

316
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:17,122
(muted scream)

317
00:24:19,232 --> 00:24:21,757
Hey.

318
00:24:21,801 --> 00:24:23,860
I'm okay.

319
00:24:24,938 --> 00:24:27,600
(man screaming)

320
00:24:29,909 --> 00:24:32,207
(strap slapping)

321
00:24:35,915 --> 00:24:37,542
Do you know where Glenn...

322
00:24:57,804 --> 00:24:59,465
I'm looking
for Glenn Custis.

323
00:24:59,506 --> 00:25:01,667
(woman screaming)

324
00:25:11,418 --> 00:25:13,249
(screaming continues,
muted)

- (door slams)
- (panting)

326
00:25:52,525 --> 00:25:54,186
- (strap lashing)
- (woman grunting)

327
00:25:54,227 --> 00:25:57,663
Woman:
Yeah! Mmm...

328
00:26:14,814 --> 00:26:16,907
(gasps)

329
00:26:18,518 --> 00:26:21,510
Rasputin here
says Custis is out.

330
00:26:21,554 --> 00:26:23,920
Glenn, this guy's
looking for you.

331
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:26,425
Glenn?
I'm not Glenn.

332
00:26:27,594 --> 00:26:29,357
Nice hands.

333
00:26:29,396 --> 00:26:31,591
Nice fingers.

334
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:36,401
- You're white.
- Let go.

335
00:26:36,436 --> 00:26:38,199
Let go, let go.

336
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,965
(sniffing)

337
00:26:43,009 --> 00:26:45,637
Hey hey hey hey hey,
look at me.

338
00:26:45,678 --> 00:26:48,647
Look at me, look at me, look at me.
You know who this is?

339
00:26:48,681 --> 00:26:50,876
This is one of
Custis's girls.

340
00:26:50,917 --> 00:26:53,283
That's right, one of
Glenn's girl... Look at me.

341
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:56,516
Just look at me.
Look in my eyes.

342
00:26:56,556 --> 00:26:58,786
Tell Custis
I'm looking for him.

343
00:27:01,361 --> 00:27:02,919
(distant siren wails)

344
00:27:02,962 --> 00:27:04,156
Fuck.

345
00:27:04,197 --> 00:27:06,529
(panting)

346
00:27:09,335 --> 00:27:11,496
(toilet flushing)

347
00:27:22,715 --> 00:27:24,683
Errol:
So you're not seeing anyone,

348
00:27:24,717 --> 00:27:27,686
I mean anyone
who stayed.

349
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:31,121
What did I tell you about
the personal stuff?

350
00:27:31,157 --> 00:27:32,784
(uncorks bottle)

351
00:27:32,826 --> 00:27:34,521
Okay.

352
00:27:34,561 --> 00:27:36,722
- Whatever.
- (pouring)

353
00:27:51,244 --> 00:27:54,577
It's just that l...

354
00:27:54,614 --> 00:27:58,812
I didn't see a spare toothbrush
or a man's razor, so...

355
00:28:01,955 --> 00:28:05,254
But I did see a large
pea coat hanging there.

356
00:28:05,291 --> 00:28:08,556
Shiny elbows and
missing buttons, so...

357
00:28:10,129 --> 00:28:13,326
A smoker. It's not exactly
your style, I don't think.

358
00:28:13,366 --> 00:28:17,996
But I guess it suited
your needs for the time.

359
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,209
Do you ever just have
a normal conversation?

360
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:25,871
This is normal
conversation.

361
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:29,370
No, I mean,
"Hey... hey, how are you?

362
00:28:29,415 --> 00:28:32,612
Nice weather, huh?
Hey, thanks for the drink."

363
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,417
(ice clinking)

364
00:28:35,455 --> 00:28:37,150
(freezer door closing)

365
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:40,091
You don't talk,
you pump.

366
00:28:44,364 --> 00:28:46,195
(snoring)

367
00:29:21,768 --> 00:29:23,736
(car door closes)

368
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:25,431
(car starts)

369
00:29:29,876 --> 00:29:33,607
(car pulls away)

370
00:29:45,024 --> 00:29:48,084
Reporter on radio:
The fire has consumed over 1700 acres

371
00:29:48,127 --> 00:29:50,027
and 14 houses.

372
00:29:50,063 --> 00:29:52,031
In other news, police
are investigating

373
00:29:52,065 --> 00:29:54,363
the disappearance
of Harriet Wells.

374
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,800
The 17-year-old is believed
to have been abducted

375
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:59,600
in the Paradise Hills area
sometime yesterday.

376
00:29:59,639 --> 00:30:01,607
Harriet's parents made
a plea in help

377
00:30:01,641 --> 00:30:03,472
tracing their daughter's
whereabouts.

378
00:30:03,509 --> 00:30:05,909
Mrs. Wells: We just want
our daughter to come home.

379
00:30:05,945 --> 00:30:08,743
We want her to come back.
She's our everything,

380
00:30:08,781 --> 00:30:10,442
our whole life.

381
00:30:10,483 --> 00:30:12,747
If anyone knows
where she is,

382
00:30:12,785 --> 00:30:15,549
please just help me
bring my baby home.

383
00:30:15,588 --> 00:30:17,613
Man: Police have no suspects
at this time.

384
00:30:17,657 --> 00:30:19,648
If you have any
information...

385
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:22,422
Errol: It's one of my flock.
I know it. I missed something.

386
00:30:22,462 --> 00:30:24,362
- Allison: Errol, slow down.
- Are you watching this?

387
00:30:24,397 --> 00:30:26,422
- Yeah, I just turned it on.
- I'm not gonna go out like this.

388
00:30:26,466 --> 00:30:27,933
I'm not gonna have
a mista...

389
00:30:27,967 --> 00:30:29,525
- (glass smashes)
- God damn it.

390
00:30:29,569 --> 00:30:31,264
- Are you okay?
- No.

391
00:30:31,304 --> 00:30:33,534
No. No, I'm not okay.
I'm not okay.

392
00:30:33,573 --> 00:30:35,541
Errol, you can't
take this personally.

393
00:30:35,575 --> 00:30:37,736
You take this stuff
personally!

394
00:30:37,777 --> 00:30:40,769
I've been on this job 18 years.
You haven't even fucking started.

395
00:30:40,813 --> 00:30:43,281
- You haven't even started.
- (line clicks)

396
00:30:43,316 --> 00:30:45,284
Reporter on TV:
...may have been the last to see her.

397
00:30:45,318 --> 00:30:47,843
While friends and family
continue their own search efforts... #

398
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:50,117
Reporter #2: Harriet's parents
made a plea today

399
00:30:50,156 --> 00:30:52,420
for help in tracing
their daughter's whereabouts,

400
00:30:52,458 --> 00:30:54,858
but, investigators say,
false tips continue

401
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:56,885
to complicate
the investigation.

402
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:43,098
Sorry about
the phone call.

403
00:31:57,256 --> 00:31:58,416
(police radios,
indistinct)

404
00:31:58,458 --> 00:31:59,891
Department
of Public Safety.

405
00:31:59,926 --> 00:32:01,860
All right,
come with me.

406
00:32:01,894 --> 00:32:03,384
Can you wait here,
please?

407
00:32:05,665 --> 00:32:07,132
- Officer in charge?
- Woman: Yes.

408
00:32:07,166 --> 00:32:09,794
Can I talk to you a second?
Something I want to show you...

409
00:32:09,836 --> 00:32:11,997
Babbage, we're on it.

410
00:32:12,038 --> 00:32:14,006
(sighs)

411
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:17,635
There are over 40 registered
sexual offenders...

412
00:32:17,677 --> 00:32:19,508
- I know.
...within two miles of here.

413
00:32:19,545 --> 00:32:20,807
I know.

414
00:32:20,847 --> 00:32:23,145
We're handling it.

415
00:32:23,182 --> 00:32:25,275
Man on police radio:
...responding to the possible 211.

416
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:27,946
2110 Emerson.

417
00:32:30,556 --> 00:32:32,319
Man:
Just hope and pray.

418
00:32:32,358 --> 00:32:34,849
Man #2:
You're right, you're right.

419
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:38,426
You can take off, okay?

420
00:32:38,464 --> 00:32:41,126
(dog yipping)

421
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:43,101
Sure, okay.

422
00:32:45,238 --> 00:32:47,729
Man:
I don't know what else to do.

423
00:32:47,774 --> 00:32:49,207
What'd they say?

424
00:32:49,242 --> 00:32:51,107
They're gonna
give me a medal.

425
00:32:51,144 --> 00:32:53,806
- Really?
- Yeah, it's in the mail.

426
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:02,781
(country music playing)

427
00:33:05,158 --> 00:33:07,388
- Have a nice day.
- Thank you.

428
00:33:35,922 --> 00:33:37,719
Did you see who was...
was sitting there?

429
00:33:37,757 --> 00:33:39,247
The newspaper...
left it there?

430
00:33:39,292 --> 00:33:41,453
I don't think there was
anybody sitting there.

431
00:33:41,494 --> 00:33:43,052
All right.

432
00:33:49,769 --> 00:33:52,704
- Did you put this here?
- No.

433
00:33:52,738 --> 00:33:55,536
Someone left this here.
They left it for me.

434
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:57,133
How do you know
somebody left it for you?

435
00:33:57,176 --> 00:33:58,734
Look at it... it's circled.

436
00:33:58,778 --> 00:34:01,042
It's folded just like me.
Everything's the same.

437
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,708
Look. Don't don't don't
don't... don't touch.

438
00:34:03,749 --> 00:34:05,239
This is the one
I bought.

439
00:34:05,284 --> 00:34:07,809
See that?

440
00:34:24,737 --> 00:34:28,173
Each of those
are offenders.

441
00:34:28,207 --> 00:34:31,699
Red ones committed violent sexual acts
against teenage girls

442
00:34:31,744 --> 00:34:33,302
or young women.

443
00:34:33,346 --> 00:34:35,109
We'll start with
the registrants

444
00:34:35,147 --> 00:34:37,411
that are closest
to the missing girl.

445
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:40,044
It could take weeks to
track down all these people.

446
00:34:40,086 --> 00:34:42,452
Someone I know has her.

447
00:34:42,488 --> 00:34:44,649
Someone who knows me.

448
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:47,454
Someone on
my registry.

449
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:06,638
(birds squawking)

450
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:09,443
Did she meet
a boy here?

451
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:11,575
A friend?

452
00:35:14,787 --> 00:35:17,483
Was someone waiting
for her here?

453
00:35:18,925 --> 00:35:20,916
(crossing bells dinging)

454
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:28,065
Did someone see?

455
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,091
(train whistle blowing)

456
00:35:56,329 --> 00:35:59,389
Between 4:00, 4:30,
you're the only engine on that track?

457
00:35:59,432 --> 00:36:01,024
Yeah.

458
00:36:01,067 --> 00:36:03,297
Car was white...
light color, anyways.

459
00:36:03,336 --> 00:36:06,032
Newish.
Shit, maybe even Jap.

460
00:36:06,072 --> 00:36:08,131
She was talking to somebody
in the car, but hell,

461
00:36:08,174 --> 00:36:10,074
looked like she was just
trying to catch a ride.

462
00:36:10,109 --> 00:36:12,168
Did you see him?
Did you see the driver?

463
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:14,975
- The guy she was talking to?
- Man: Nah, we didn't see anyone.

464
00:36:15,014 --> 00:36:17,005
There was a glare
on the windshield.

465
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:20,018
But you got it wrong.
She wasn't talking to the driver.

466
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:23,215
She was talking to someone
in the passenger seat.

467
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:34,495
Errol: Harriet talks to someone
on the passenger side.

468
00:36:34,533 --> 00:36:36,728
That means we're
looking for a team.

469
00:36:36,769 --> 00:36:40,330
Could be an old team,
could be a brand-new team.

470
00:36:40,373 --> 00:36:43,968
Teams are glued together
by common sexual appetites

471
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:45,534
and fetishes.

472
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:47,910
So you hit the files.

473
00:36:47,947 --> 00:36:50,381
I'll hit the phones.
I'll see who's quit a job,

474
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:53,908
changed their patterns.
I'll listen to their voices.

475
00:36:53,953 --> 00:36:56,012
Man:
Hello?

476
00:36:56,055 --> 00:36:58,148
Errol: You're looking for abductors,
rape or assault charges.

477
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:00,681
Any perps with victims
or MOs that match,

478
00:37:00,726 --> 00:37:02,455
you red-flag it,
give it to me.

479
00:37:02,495 --> 00:37:04,463
Can I talk to your boss
to confirm that?

480
00:37:04,497 --> 00:37:06,294
Man: If you think
that's really necessary.

481
00:37:06,332 --> 00:37:08,926
Errol:
Put your boss on, Randy.

482
00:37:12,405 --> 00:37:14,771
(ringing)

483
00:37:17,376 --> 00:37:19,207
(phone ringing)

484
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,505
(door opens)

485
00:37:49,542 --> 00:37:52,033
Allison?

486
00:37:56,182 --> 00:37:57,740
You know, I got
a phone call today

487
00:37:57,783 --> 00:38:00,047
from a very agitated
sheriff's investigator.

488
00:38:00,086 --> 00:38:02,418
It seems a girl
has disappeared.

489
00:38:02,455 --> 00:38:04,389
And you were out
at her house?

490
00:38:04,423 --> 00:38:06,391
Errol thinks one of
the registrants may be involved.

491
00:38:06,425 --> 00:38:07,892
And how did Errol
come up with that one?

492
00:38:07,927 --> 00:38:09,895
Someone circled an article
in the newspaper

493
00:38:09,929 --> 00:38:11,954
and left it
for him to find.

494
00:38:11,997 --> 00:38:13,430
(chuckles)

495
00:38:20,706 --> 00:38:25,006
Errol was a no-show at his
retirement party the other night.

496
00:38:25,044 --> 00:38:27,012
I'm not sure
I understand.

497
00:38:27,046 --> 00:38:31,176
These guys here are all familiar
with Errol's routines

498
00:38:31,217 --> 00:38:32,582
and his habits.

499
00:38:32,618 --> 00:38:35,280
Like how he dissects
the newspapers, for instance.

500
00:38:35,321 --> 00:38:37,721
There was talk at the party
of getting back at him.

501
00:38:37,756 --> 00:38:39,724
You think someone here
circled the article?

502
00:38:39,758 --> 00:38:41,521
Yeah. Could be.

503
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:45,121
I mean, he doesn't have
a lot of friends around here.

504
00:38:45,164 --> 00:38:46,631
Well, maybe not.

505
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,767
Are you gonna tell him?

506
00:38:49,802 --> 00:38:51,736
You're gonna tell him.

507
00:38:53,272 --> 00:38:54,967
Oh, and this
abduction thing...

508
00:38:55,007 --> 00:38:58,340
has nothing to do with
what you're being paid for.

509
00:38:58,377 --> 00:39:01,278
We're not police officers...
we're public servants.

510
00:39:01,313 --> 00:39:02,746
All right?

511
00:39:04,617 --> 00:39:07,211
So we have 40 offenders
within a two-mile radius,

512
00:39:07,253 --> 00:39:09,687
89 within a five-mile
radius.

513
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:11,189
We're gonna hit
every single one of 'em.

514
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:13,691
Shouldn't we narrow
down the list first?

515
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:16,661
No, I want to
start now.

516
00:39:16,695 --> 00:39:19,721
(sighs)

517
00:39:19,765 --> 00:39:22,757
I'm gonna call it a day.

518
00:39:22,801 --> 00:39:25,565
Yeah, you do that.
Just call it a day.

519
00:39:27,473 --> 00:39:31,341
Two months... that's how long
you're gonna last.

520
00:39:31,377 --> 00:39:35,177
But why should this job
be any different than the others?

521
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:42,081
I'm not one of
your registrants, Errol.

522
00:39:42,121 --> 00:39:44,954
Just lay off
the personal stuff.

523
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:47,220
Your mother says
you spook easily.

524
00:39:56,235 --> 00:39:59,102
- You talked to my mother?
- Among others.

525
00:39:59,138 --> 00:40:03,131
Said you change jobs at about
the same rate you change men.

526
00:40:07,546 --> 00:40:10,481
Does privacy mean anything
to you, Errol?

527
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:20,181
You are a nosy person,
my friend.

528
00:40:20,226 --> 00:40:22,694
He didn't just leave that
newspaper for me.

529
00:40:22,728 --> 00:40:25,219
He left it for you too.

530
00:40:25,264 --> 00:40:27,255
When they find
Harriet's body in a month,

531
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:30,496
you'll be the one sitting
at this desk, not me.

532
00:40:30,536 --> 00:40:32,197
(door slams)

533
00:40:39,011 --> 00:40:41,070
Man on TV: Police are investigating
the disappearance...

534
00:40:41,113 --> 00:40:43,172
- (phone ringing)
- Ahem.

535
00:40:43,215 --> 00:40:44,944
Police have
no suspects...

536
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:46,611
- Man: Hello?
- Matt?

537
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:49,883
Hi, it's Allison Lowry...
from the department.

538
00:40:49,922 --> 00:40:51,685
Ah, the new girl
in town.

539
00:40:51,724 --> 00:40:54,124
Uh, the new girl.
Yeah.

540
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:55,854
Listen, I have to ask you,

541
00:40:55,894 --> 00:40:58,658
do you know if people
in the department are taunting Errol?

542
00:40:58,697 --> 00:41:00,688
- No.
- What about that...

543
00:41:00,733 --> 00:41:03,702
the gag with the newspaper?
With the circling?

544
00:41:03,736 --> 00:41:07,763
No no no, none of us.
Wasn't me. No.

545
00:41:07,806 --> 00:41:09,239
- Not you either?
- No.

546
00:41:09,275 --> 00:41:10,970
Okay, I was wrong.

547
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:13,740
All right, well, I'll see you
tomorrow at work, Allison.

548
00:41:13,779 --> 00:41:15,838
- You have a good...
- Well... but, hey?

549
00:41:15,881 --> 00:41:17,678
Since I have you
on the phone,

550
00:41:17,716 --> 00:41:20,276
um, what else can you
tell me about Errol?

551
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:23,720
Well, he likes
to circle newspapers.

552
00:41:23,756 --> 00:41:26,088
Right, I've noticed.

553
00:41:26,125 --> 00:41:28,650
- Well, Errol's a good guy.
- Mm-hmm.

554
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:31,754
When he started,
he was great.

555
00:41:31,797 --> 00:41:33,890
- Yeah.
- It was this one case...

556
00:41:33,932 --> 00:41:36,264
a young girl named
Abigail taken,

557
00:41:36,302 --> 00:41:38,429
and he got obsessed
by the whole thing

558
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:41,371
and, oh, he got in some
serious trouble that time.

559
00:41:41,407 --> 00:41:43,568
He started carrying
a gun around

560
00:41:43,609 --> 00:41:45,702
and we don't carry guns.

561
00:41:45,744 --> 00:41:48,212
It's not part
of our job.

562
00:41:48,247 --> 00:41:49,714
Well, thanks, Matt.
I appreciate it.

563
00:41:49,748 --> 00:41:51,909
- Have a good night.
- Good night.

564
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:54,612
She was friendly, outgoing,
usually got along with everyone.

565
00:41:54,653 --> 00:41:56,245
I don't think she ran away,

566
00:41:56,288 --> 00:41:57,915
but if she did,
she should really come back.

567
00:41:57,956 --> 00:42:00,220
Man: Hey, Harriet,
you're on TV.

568
00:42:00,259 --> 00:42:01,783
Miss you, Harriet.
Please come home.

569
00:42:01,827 --> 00:42:03,852
(man giggles
maniacally)

570
00:42:12,771 --> 00:42:14,966
(water running)

571
00:42:18,177 --> 00:42:19,542
Oh my God!

572
00:42:25,784 --> 00:42:27,752
What are you
doing here, Errol?

573
00:42:27,786 --> 00:42:29,583
Um...

574
00:42:29,621 --> 00:42:32,522
uh, I have to
tell you something.

575
00:42:32,558 --> 00:42:35,527
I have to tell you that...

576
00:42:35,561 --> 00:42:38,291
that I have trouble
trusting...

577
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:40,628
(sighs)

578
00:42:40,666 --> 00:42:43,294
I have trouble
trusting people.

579
00:42:44,503 --> 00:42:47,802
Um, even non-registrants.

580
00:42:48,807 --> 00:42:50,968
Um...

581
00:42:51,009 --> 00:42:55,605
and I apologize for being
insensitive to your privacy,

582
00:42:55,647 --> 00:42:58,445
even though a background check
is not entirely unreasonable.

583
00:43:03,922 --> 00:43:06,117
Apology accepted.

584
00:43:07,292 --> 00:43:09,852
You were right.

585
00:43:09,895 --> 00:43:12,523
We got to narrow down
that list.

586
00:43:19,204 --> 00:43:21,866
"Daniel Barden:

Am I gonna take this
to your parole officer?

598

not gonna tell.

Yeah.

00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:37,080
(dings bell)

642
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:39,955
I got friends in low places.
Isn't that right, Louis?

643
00:48:39,991 --> 00:48:41,618
What are you doing here?

644
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:45,187
I just wanted to see how
the new job is shaping up.

645
00:48:45,230 --> 00:48:47,858
I hear you do good work.

646
00:48:47,899 --> 00:48:51,027
I don't handle
the photo center.

647
00:48:51,069 --> 00:48:53,663
And the woman who does
won't be back until...

648
00:48:54,973 --> 00:48:57,203
Who do you think
you're talking to?

649
00:49:00,112 --> 00:49:03,138
Louis Louis.

650
00:49:03,181 --> 00:49:06,275
Let's see, your hobby
is photography...

651
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:09,151
boys and girls at play,
as I remember.

652
00:49:09,187 --> 00:49:10,882
And I do.
And I do.

653
00:49:10,922 --> 00:49:13,288
Look at that.

654
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:16,021
I don't do that
anymore.

655
00:49:16,061 --> 00:49:18,029
He says he doesn't
do that anymore.

656
00:49:18,063 --> 00:49:20,531
Should we believe him?

657
00:49:20,565 --> 00:49:22,157
People get well.

658
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:25,363
Not my people.

659
00:49:25,403 --> 00:49:28,770
She thinks she knows you, Louis,
but she doesn't, does she?

660
00:49:31,977 --> 00:49:34,275
- No.
- No. No.

661
00:49:36,281 --> 00:49:39,978
This room is the only reason
you took this shitty job.

662
00:49:40,018 --> 00:49:42,009
Tell her.

663
00:49:53,632 --> 00:49:56,294
(Allison gasps)

664
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:07,335
Do you think that's
the missing girl?

665
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:09,210
Do you think
that's Harriet?

666
00:50:09,247 --> 00:50:12,375
Not unless she has
two left feet.

667
00:50:12,417 --> 00:50:15,250
There are at least three
people here, probably more.

668
00:50:15,287 --> 00:50:17,380
Do you think he did this?
Did he cut these women?

669
00:50:17,422 --> 00:50:21,324
I think he has a friend
in a funeral parlor or a morgue.

670
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:23,623
He probably did
the carving.

671
00:50:23,662 --> 00:50:25,687
l...

672
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:27,129
I don't get this.

673
00:50:27,165 --> 00:50:29,030
Well, you're probably
holding it wrong.

674
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:32,525
Yeah, like a centerfold.

675
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:33,936
Porno, you know.

676
00:50:33,972 --> 00:50:36,338
This is all porno.
Just porno.

677
00:50:36,374 --> 00:50:38,035
Every bit of it.

678
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:39,873
No.

679
00:50:52,624 --> 00:50:54,615
- I'd like you to see these.
- No, I can't.

680
00:50:54,659 --> 00:50:57,253
I want you to
see this girl.

681
00:51:01,333 --> 00:51:03,426
- Is it Harriet?
- No.

682
00:51:10,542 --> 00:51:14,171
They're staged,
all of 'em.

683
00:51:14,212 --> 00:51:17,943
He didn't touch her face.
The real thing isn't so pretty.

684
00:51:24,122 --> 00:51:26,716
I saw Custis back
at his house.

685
00:51:26,758 --> 00:51:28,749
He was 10 feet
away from me, Errol.

686
00:51:30,061 --> 00:51:33,827
Does that mean
anything to you?

687
00:51:33,865 --> 00:51:36,595
That could have been me,
only for real.

688
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:40,127
I'm scared of Custis.
Yeah, I am.

689
00:51:40,171 --> 00:51:42,833
But you know what, Errol?
I'm also scared of you.

690
00:51:42,874 --> 00:51:45,468
You have blindsided me
at every turn

691
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:47,102
and that has got to stop.

692
00:51:50,181 --> 00:51:51,739
Yeah.

693
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,958
Do you think Custis knows
anything about Harriet Wells?

694
00:52:07,065 --> 00:52:08,430
(sighs)

695
00:52:10,869 --> 00:52:13,235
Tomorrow
we can ask him.

696
00:52:16,908 --> 00:52:19,342
Do you think
we can find him?

697
00:52:22,247 --> 00:52:25,842
One of our flock is gonna
know where he is.

698
00:52:39,264 --> 00:52:41,562
Errol:
Haines Ownby...

699
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:44,500
four counts solicitation
of underage individual

700
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:46,936
to engage
in sexual performance.

701
00:52:46,972 --> 00:52:49,497
What's he doing here?

702
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:52,101
It's his feeding ground.

703
00:53:04,990 --> 00:53:07,390
(speaking indistinctly)

704
00:53:13,631 --> 00:53:16,225
Doing some shopping,
Ownby?

705
00:53:16,267 --> 00:53:18,098
Ownby: Well, there's
a sale on panties.

706
00:53:18,136 --> 00:53:21,799
Men's department. You might
wanna check that out yourself.

707
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:31,113
I'm looking
for Glenn Custis.

708
00:53:31,149 --> 00:53:34,380
She might know where he is.
You know where I can find her?

709
00:53:34,419 --> 00:53:37,513
You know, I don't do
that type of thing.

710
00:53:37,555 --> 00:53:39,113
Violence turns
my stomach.

711
00:53:39,157 --> 00:53:41,216
Oh, I forgot, yeah.

712
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:44,127
Did you hear

713
00:53:44,162 --> 00:53:46,653
I'm being put out to pasture.
Did you know that?

714
00:53:50,502 --> 00:53:53,733
Now someone wants

715
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:56,468
to take what's left
of the man in me.

716
00:53:56,508 --> 00:53:58,373
They've been
fucking with me,

717
00:53:58,410 --> 00:54:00,674
trying to break me.

718
00:54:00,712 --> 00:54:04,409
And I feel
that if they do,

719
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:07,441
and I don't find
a certain missing someone...

720
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:12,487
we're going to lose Errol Babbage
as we know him.

721
00:54:13,958 --> 00:54:17,519
He will emerge
as a total stranger,

722
00:54:17,562 --> 00:54:19,860
and then all of us

723
00:54:19,898 --> 00:54:22,628
will have to take
our chances

724
00:54:22,667 --> 00:54:25,158
and someone might
get hurt.

725
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:32,735
Well, maybe I've seen her around,
and I could make a call.

726
00:54:32,777 --> 00:54:35,644
Yeah yeah, thank you.

727
00:54:37,415 --> 00:54:39,781
(carousel music playing)

728
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:42,184
My name's Errol.
What's yours?

729
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:45,018
- Nadine.
- Nadine, nice name.

730
00:54:45,056 --> 00:54:47,320
I'm going to ask you something.
I work for the city.

731
00:54:47,358 --> 00:54:49,986
I'm looking for someone...
this is kind of important to me.

732
00:54:50,028 --> 00:54:52,326
Is this you?

733
00:54:54,265 --> 00:54:56,256
Fuck off.

734
00:54:57,569 --> 00:54:59,264
I think this is you.

735
00:54:59,304 --> 00:55:02,171
- It looks to me that that is you.
- No, it's okay.

736
00:55:04,075 --> 00:55:06,942
Did Glenn Custis
take these?

737
00:55:09,147 --> 00:55:11,513
- All right, I'll catch you later.
- Okay.

738
00:55:14,953 --> 00:55:18,480
- If I tell you, will Glenn find out?
- No no, I promise.

739
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:20,491
I don't know where
to find him,

740
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:23,016
but I can tell you
how he found me.

741
00:55:23,061 --> 00:55:24,722
Okay.

742
00:55:24,762 --> 00:55:27,629
The lady that cuts
my hair.

743
00:55:35,373 --> 00:55:37,705
What did you do,
go shopping?

744
00:55:40,378 --> 00:55:43,040
You stay away from here,
you hear me?

745
00:55:43,081 --> 00:55:46,915
Yeah, I got a new tie.
What do you think?

746
00:55:46,951 --> 00:55:49,852
Did you know Custis
and Viola Gerard know each other?

747
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:51,355
Yes.

748
00:55:51,389 --> 00:55:53,755
Did you know he's been
hanging around her beauty salon?

749
00:55:58,796 --> 00:56:02,095
Viola.
Is Viola here?

750
00:56:02,133 --> 00:56:05,500
No, her chair's been empty
the last couple of days.

751
00:56:08,106 --> 00:56:09,573
Of course he would hang
around the salon.

752
00:56:09,607 --> 00:56:12,405
He can watch the girls get
their hair done, their nails done,

753
00:56:12,443 --> 00:56:15,037
hands, feet.

754
00:56:15,079 --> 00:56:17,047
Do you think one of those girls
is Harriet Wells?

755
00:56:17,081 --> 00:56:19,811
Look, Viola was
on the passenger side.

756
00:56:22,353 --> 00:56:24,617
Custis was the driver.

757
00:56:24,656 --> 00:56:26,419
Harriet recognized Viola.

758
00:56:26,457 --> 00:56:28,186
- That's why she got in.
- (lock jiggling)

759
00:57:02,694 --> 00:57:04,924
Allison:
Errol, look at this.

760
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:06,931
That's what's wrong
with the registry.

761
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:10,332
We don't just alert the public. We alert
every degenerate in the country.

762
00:57:11,869 --> 00:57:13,996
You think Custis found
Viola on the registry?

763
00:57:14,038 --> 00:57:16,097
I think they found
each other.

764
00:57:22,046 --> 00:57:25,106
Is that the bed?

765
00:57:25,149 --> 00:57:28,915
Is that the bed
from the photos?

766
00:57:28,953 --> 00:57:30,978
Looks like it.

767
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:11,258
She's running
a fan club.

768
00:58:16,501 --> 00:58:19,197
Errol: So that's the team.
Custis is the photographer.

769
00:58:19,237 --> 00:58:22,673
Allison: Custis hooks up with Viola,
mistakes her for a kindred spirit.

770
00:58:22,707 --> 00:58:25,403
She tells him
about the fan mail.

771
00:58:25,443 --> 00:58:28,435
So Custis has the idea
for this fan club setup.

772
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:30,140
They find some girls

773
00:58:30,181 --> 00:58:33,150
and they take
some photos,

774
00:58:33,184 --> 00:58:35,152
but that just
turns Custis on.

775
00:58:35,186 --> 00:58:36,517
So now he needs
the real thing.

776
00:58:36,554 --> 00:58:38,749
He forces Viola
to help him abduct Harriet.

777
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:43,960
They find some girls,
they take some photos.

778
00:58:43,995 --> 00:58:46,259
Errol, look at this stuff.

779
00:58:46,297 --> 00:58:48,765
It's unbelievable.
"Dear Mrs. Gerard,

780
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:51,894
my heartfelt condolences
for your husband's senseless execution.

781
00:58:51,936 --> 00:58:53,699
And I thought
I was misunderstood.

782
00:58:53,738 --> 00:58:57,435
Would it be possible to pay
my respects in person?"

783
00:58:59,877 --> 00:59:03,313
It's always
the same kind of stuff.

784
00:59:03,348 --> 00:59:04,838
It's all the same.

785
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:19,563
This is
a family restaurant.

786
00:59:19,597 --> 00:59:20,996
There are children
present.

787
00:59:21,032 --> 00:59:23,762
Well, maybe we're
exhibitionists.

788
00:59:23,801 --> 00:59:25,769
Maybe we
like it that way.

789
00:59:25,803 --> 00:59:29,068
Exhibitionists
expose themselves

790
00:59:29,107 --> 00:59:31,598
usually to make
an impression

791
00:59:31,642 --> 00:59:33,576
with an otherwise
unimpressive cock.

792
00:59:33,611 --> 00:59:35,602
Now what you are
is an agoraphiliac.

793
00:59:37,081 --> 00:59:39,914
You get turned on
by having sex in public.

794
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:41,942
You need
to shock strangers

795
00:59:41,986 --> 00:59:45,888
in order to boost your otherwise
deficient genital prowess,

796
00:59:47,458 --> 00:59:50,427
to beef up your beef...

797
00:59:50,461 --> 00:59:53,487
(laughing)
so to speak.

798
00:59:55,166 --> 00:59:59,102
Hey, get the fuck out
of here.

799
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:01,037
Fucking pervert.

800
01:00:02,173 --> 01:00:04,107
What the fuck
is your problem, huh?

801
01:00:04,142 --> 01:00:07,111
Don't you get it?
Get the hell out of here.

802
01:00:07,145 --> 01:00:08,635
(woman screams)

803
01:00:29,434 --> 01:00:32,631
Harriet called her mother
today from California.

804
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:35,298
She wasn't abducted, Errol.
She's a runaway.

805
01:00:41,979 --> 01:00:44,379
(laughing)

806
01:00:50,188 --> 01:00:54,022
- He's getting killed.
- You wanna let me in on the damn joke?

807
01:01:08,439 --> 01:01:10,430
Bobby: Allison.

808
01:01:15,947 --> 01:01:18,074
There's a direct connection
between at least one of our registrants

809
01:01:18,115 --> 01:01:20,777
and that missing girl Harriet Wells...
Glenn Custis

810
01:01:20,818 --> 01:01:22,581
and Viola Gerard.
They're both AWOL.

811
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:25,487
And Errol led you
to this conclusion?

812
01:01:26,891 --> 01:01:29,724
Yes, it was his
investigation.

813
01:01:30,995 --> 01:01:33,862
Harriet called her mother
today from California.

814
01:01:33,898 --> 01:01:36,389
She called?

815
01:01:36,434 --> 01:01:38,425
Mm-hmm, I mean,
they're following up,

816
01:01:38,469 --> 01:01:41,302
but she is now

817
01:01:41,339 --> 01:01:42,966
just a runaway.

818
01:01:43,007 --> 01:01:44,975
Did you tell Errol?

819
01:01:45,009 --> 01:01:46,499
Yep.

820
01:01:46,544 --> 01:01:49,274
Well, looks like he's
cleared out his desk.

821
01:01:49,313 --> 01:01:51,372
It's all yours.

822
01:01:51,415 --> 01:01:55,283
So why don't you start your job over
before you lose it?

823
01:01:55,319 --> 01:01:57,287
We got two missing
registrants.

824
01:01:57,321 --> 01:01:59,346
Begin with
finding them.

825
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:05,227
So that's it?

826
01:02:05,263 --> 01:02:07,254
I mean, for Errol?

827
01:02:07,298 --> 01:02:09,562
Errol says he can tell
when someone's offending

828
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:12,160
or about to offend.
They get all hyped up.

829
01:02:12,203 --> 01:02:15,468
They start drinking
too much, stop grooming.

830
01:02:15,506 --> 01:02:17,269
And look at him.

831
01:02:17,308 --> 01:02:20,243
Could be his own profile.

832
01:02:20,278 --> 01:02:22,974
So, yeah,
that's it for Errol.

833
01:02:52,376 --> 01:02:54,344
- Man: Fucking Babbage came by!
- (Harriet sobbing)

834
01:02:54,378 --> 01:02:56,369
How did that happen,
you fucking asshole?

835
01:02:56,414 --> 01:02:58,177
How did it happen?

836
01:02:58,215 --> 01:03:00,240
- Woman: Shh.
- (men shouting)

837
01:03:00,284 --> 01:03:04,084
It's okay.
It's okay.

838
01:03:04,121 --> 01:03:05,748
Stay quiet.

839
01:03:05,790 --> 01:03:07,758
Just trust me.

840
01:03:07,792 --> 01:03:11,193
- I'll protect you. It's okay, baby.
- (shouting continuing)

841
01:03:11,228 --> 01:03:13,788
Shh!

842
01:03:13,831 --> 01:03:15,526
If they come...

843
01:03:15,566 --> 01:03:18,228
if they come,
just stay calm.

844
01:03:18,269 --> 01:03:21,033
- I promise you. I promise you.
- Hey!

845
01:03:21,072 --> 01:03:24,769
(screaming)

846
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:29,036
No no!

847
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:31,412
No!

848
01:03:32,717 --> 01:03:36,084
No!

849
01:03:52,603 --> 01:03:55,970
If I asked you, you think
you could make a phone call?

850
01:03:56,007 --> 01:03:58,339
You could say you're
in California

851
01:03:58,376 --> 01:04:00,606
alive and well.

852
01:04:00,645 --> 01:04:02,010
I don't know.

853
01:04:02,046 --> 01:04:05,209
Could you make it
sound convincing?

854
01:04:05,249 --> 01:04:08,218
Put the gun down, Errol.
Put it down!

855
01:04:08,252 --> 01:04:11,153
Custis and Viola
have Harriet Wells,

856
01:04:11,188 --> 01:04:13,179
and I don't care
what she told them...

857
01:04:13,224 --> 01:04:15,920
Get the fuck out
of my house!

858
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:18,485
Get out!

859
01:04:18,529 --> 01:04:20,929
I'm sorry.

860
01:04:20,965 --> 01:04:22,956
Look at these.

861
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,867
We thought that these... all of these
were taken at Viola's house.

862
01:04:25,903 --> 01:04:28,235
They weren't.
They were taken here.

863
01:04:28,272 --> 01:04:30,103
- Look at this.
- Stop it, Errol.

864
01:04:30,141 --> 01:04:32,939
Look, you see that?
It's the same, the same bed.

865
01:04:32,977 --> 01:04:34,467
- It's the same bed.
- Stop it, Errol.

866
01:04:34,512 --> 01:04:37,174
This is where it happened,
at the site of the original murders.

867
01:04:37,214 --> 01:04:39,375
That's where it was.
See, that's where they go.

868
01:04:39,417 --> 01:04:43,319
- Viola... she lived here in this house.
- I'm not listening to this.

869
01:04:43,354 --> 01:04:45,322
Her and Paul,
they lived right there.

870
01:04:45,356 --> 01:04:48,154
- That's where they've taken Harriet.
- I don't care!

871
01:04:48,192 --> 01:04:50,626
- I don't care.
- Harriet is here.

872
01:04:50,661 --> 01:04:53,289
- Harriet...
- Stop this!

873
01:04:53,330 --> 01:04:56,857
You have to stop this.

874
01:04:58,369 --> 01:05:00,769
Please leave!

875
01:05:00,805 --> 01:05:04,434
Get out, get out!

876
01:05:48,919 --> 01:05:51,717
- (gunshot)
- (glass shatters)

877
01:06:01,332 --> 01:06:03,664
Shit, Errol,
what are you doing?

878
01:06:05,069 --> 01:06:07,367
I don't know.

879
01:06:30,227 --> 01:06:33,663
You have to let
it go, Errol.

880
01:06:33,697 --> 01:06:35,961
You have to let it go.

881
01:06:40,204 --> 01:06:43,230
You've done your best.

882
01:06:47,678 --> 01:06:50,613
A girl didn't come home.

883
01:06:50,648 --> 01:06:52,809
Lots of girls
don't come home...

884
01:06:52,850 --> 01:06:55,318
a hundred a day.

885
01:06:58,222 --> 01:07:01,020
Sometimes I think
I could have done better.

886
01:07:01,058 --> 01:07:03,026
Let it go.

887
01:07:05,095 --> 01:07:07,290
Because sometimes
I think...

888
01:07:09,366 --> 01:07:11,459
Think about what?

889
01:07:13,571 --> 01:07:16,062
Think what, Errol?

890
01:07:22,980 --> 01:07:26,211
Sometimes I think
about hurting them.

891
01:07:30,020 --> 01:07:32,853
And when you say hurting,
you mean killing.

892
01:07:34,258 --> 01:07:37,022
Someone has to pay.

893
01:07:51,375 --> 01:07:53,343
I gotta take a trip.

894
01:07:53,377 --> 01:07:56,938
This girl didn't come home.
I'm gonna bring her home.

895
01:08:05,823 --> 01:08:08,792
Are you coming?

896
01:08:10,494 --> 01:08:12,485
You have to
promise me something...

897
01:08:14,632 --> 01:08:17,294
that this is
your last trip.

898
01:08:21,639 --> 01:08:23,038
Say it.

899
01:08:25,276 --> 01:08:28,245
This is my last
everything.

900
01:08:41,825 --> 01:08:43,918
(rock music playing)

901
01:08:46,230 --> 01:08:48,926
(man sings)
#Ooh, you come on like a dream #

902
01:08:48,966 --> 01:08:50,627
# Peaches and cream #

903
01:08:50,668 --> 01:08:53,899
# Lips like
strawberry wine #

904
01:08:53,938 --> 01:08:55,997
# You're 16,
you're beautiful... #

905
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:59,066
- How can you do this to me?
- Man: Hey, shut the fuck up!

906
01:08:59,109 --> 01:09:01,634
I'm singing.

907
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:05,274
# Ooh, what a girl,
eyes that sparkle and shine #

908
01:09:05,316 --> 01:09:07,409
# You're 16 #

909
01:09:07,451 --> 01:09:09,510
# You're beautiful #

910
01:09:09,553 --> 01:09:11,919
- # And you're mine #
- (car approaches)

911
01:09:11,956 --> 01:09:14,390
- # And you're my baby... #
- (door closes)

912
01:09:25,769 --> 01:09:28,533
(train whistle blows
in the distance)

913
01:09:41,285 --> 01:09:43,776
(gasping)

914
01:09:58,168 --> 01:10:00,636
Errol!

915
01:10:03,607 --> 01:10:05,666
Where is Harriet Wells?

916
01:10:05,709 --> 01:10:07,108
Where is she?
Is she in there?

917
01:10:07,144 --> 01:10:09,203
(labored breathing)

918
01:10:09,246 --> 01:10:12,443
- I'm gonna go call for help.
- It's too late.

919
01:10:21,358 --> 01:10:23,849
Where's Harriet Wells?

920
01:10:25,262 --> 01:10:27,856
Where is she?

921
01:10:31,668 --> 01:10:34,034
Tell me, you motherfucker.

922
01:10:35,472 --> 01:10:38,737
# When we kissed,
I could not stop #

923
01:10:38,776 --> 01:10:41,506
# You walked out of my dreams
and into my arms #

924
01:10:41,545 --> 01:10:44,173
# Now you're
my angel divine... #

925
01:10:44,214 --> 01:10:46,205
Stay back.

926
01:11:08,172 --> 01:11:10,163
(music continues)

927
01:11:10,207 --> 01:11:12,107
(door opens)

928
01:11:12,142 --> 01:11:15,942
Where's Custis?
What have you done?

929
01:11:15,979 --> 01:11:17,503
(screams)

930
01:11:39,403 --> 01:11:42,099
That's it.
They were here.

931
01:12:09,633 --> 01:12:12,329
Oh, shit!

932
01:12:12,369 --> 01:12:14,929
Shit!

933
01:12:30,888 --> 01:12:32,981
It's a girl's hand.

934
01:12:45,235 --> 01:12:47,829
(toggles light switch)

935
01:12:51,875 --> 01:12:54,105
- Flashlight in the car.
- Yeah, I'll go get it.

936
01:13:25,509 --> 01:13:27,534
(flies buzzing)

937
01:14:01,478 --> 01:14:03,469
(gasps)

938
01:15:42,012 --> 01:15:44,037
I'll pick the car up.

939
01:16:16,246 --> 01:16:18,339
Errol...

940
01:16:18,382 --> 01:16:21,283
I don't think it's Harriet.
I don't. Come here.

941
01:16:22,686 --> 01:16:24,711
Look at her tooth.

942
01:16:42,606 --> 01:16:46,007
# Why does the sun #

943
01:16:46,042 --> 01:16:49,910
# Go on shining? #

944
01:16:49,946 --> 01:16:52,346
# Why does the sea #

945
01:16:52,382 --> 01:16:55,840
# Rush to shore? #

946
01:16:55,886 --> 01:16:58,684
# Don't they know #

947
01:16:58,722 --> 01:17:02,590
# It's the end
of the world? #

948
01:17:04,561 --> 01:17:06,051
It was Grooms
with Viola.

949
01:17:06,096 --> 01:17:08,792
He moved here for the sole purpose
of meeting her.

950
01:17:08,832 --> 01:17:11,528
He probably paid Custis
to help with Harriet.

951
01:17:11,568 --> 01:17:14,196
They could be anywhere.
We need help.

952
01:17:27,951 --> 01:17:29,919
Man:
What do you want, Errol?

953
01:17:29,953 --> 01:17:31,978
Errol:
I want my 18 years back.

954
01:17:32,022 --> 01:17:34,354
You and people
like you

955
01:17:34,391 --> 01:17:37,383
have wasted my life.

956
01:17:40,397 --> 01:17:43,560
If I'm disposable...
(cocks gun)

957
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:45,864
so are you.

958
01:17:47,604 --> 01:17:49,731
(clamoring)

959
01:17:53,743 --> 01:17:55,711
Viola Gerard

960
01:17:55,745 --> 01:17:58,737
and Edmund Grooms
have strayed!

961
01:18:00,317 --> 01:18:02,683
They've taken a girl
and disappeared.

962
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:04,311
Just like that.

963
01:18:04,354 --> 01:18:06,254
Not so easy.

964
01:18:06,289 --> 01:18:08,382
Brought some kind of help.

965
01:18:12,896 --> 01:18:15,865
Carlos, did you help them?
Did you help them?

966
01:18:15,899 --> 01:18:17,093
(gunshot)

967
01:18:18,335 --> 01:18:20,701
Did you help them?
Did you? Did you?

968
01:18:20,737 --> 01:18:23,934
This is gonna get
very very messy now.

969
01:18:23,974 --> 01:18:25,942
- Here, Louis.
- Someone tell him!

970
01:18:25,976 --> 01:18:28,968
Crawl!
Put your hand up here.

971
01:18:29,012 --> 01:18:31,310
(whimpering)

972
01:18:31,348 --> 01:18:33,612
- You know where they are?
- No!

973
01:18:33,650 --> 01:18:36,949
- (gunshot)
- Stop stop stop!

974
01:18:36,987 --> 01:18:39,717
Stop stop, man, stop.

975
01:18:39,756 --> 01:18:42,418
I think I know
where they are. I do.

976
01:18:42,459 --> 01:18:45,485
I know where
they are, man.

977
01:18:54,538 --> 01:18:56,165
Harder.

978
01:18:56,206 --> 01:18:58,766
# Why does my heart #

979
01:18:58,808 --> 01:19:00,207
# Go on beating? #

980
01:19:00,243 --> 01:19:02,677
Harder!

981
01:19:02,712 --> 01:19:05,704
# Why do these eyes #

982
01:19:05,749 --> 01:19:08,377
# Of mine cry? #

983
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:13,250
Done!

984
01:19:13,290 --> 01:19:16,225
# It's the end
of the world... #

985
01:19:16,259 --> 01:19:17,886
Fucking stubby fingers.

986
01:19:17,928 --> 01:19:20,761
# It ended
when you said #

987
01:19:20,797 --> 01:19:23,960
# Goodbye. #

988
01:19:27,237 --> 01:19:30,104
It's time, Edmund.

989
01:19:31,441 --> 01:19:33,602
Can't we just leave her?

990
01:19:33,643 --> 01:19:36,168
Now you sound
like Custis.

991
01:19:46,089 --> 01:19:48,580
- Edmund!
- (crying)

992
01:19:51,328 --> 01:19:53,592
Come to me, your worm.
Come to me, come to me now.

993
01:19:54,831 --> 01:19:57,959
On your knees.

994
01:19:58,001 --> 01:20:00,799
Crawl! Faster!

995
01:20:00,837 --> 01:20:04,398
Fucking faster,
you fucking hear me?

996
01:20:04,441 --> 01:20:07,899
Cut, cut, cut!

997
01:20:19,222 --> 01:20:22,123
Shut your fucking mouth!
I will cut your air off!

998
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:53,553
- Which one is it?
- I'm not sure.

999
01:21:10,106 --> 01:21:12,438
It's okay.
It's okay.

1000
01:21:38,368 --> 01:21:40,063
(ringing)

1001
01:21:40,103 --> 01:21:42,628
It's okay.

1002
01:21:42,672 --> 01:21:45,140
(telephone ringing)

1003
01:21:49,479 --> 01:21:52,676
Custis' voice: Hey, it's Custis.
I'm out. Leave a message. Hoot!

1004
01:21:52,716 --> 01:21:55,378
Keep calling.

1005
01:21:58,388 --> 01:22:01,152
It's so good.
More!

1006
01:22:01,191 --> 01:22:04,354
- Do it!
- (telephone ringing)

1007
01:22:07,197 --> 01:22:09,324
Get the big knife.
Get the big knife!

1008
01:22:09,365 --> 01:22:11,424
(screaming)

1009
01:22:11,468 --> 01:22:14,301
- Shh!
- (telephone ringing)

1010
01:22:20,076 --> 01:22:22,704
- (Harriet screaming)
- Viola: Shut your fucking mouth!

1011
01:22:22,746 --> 01:22:26,580
(telephone ringing)

1012
01:22:28,485 --> 01:22:30,350
- It's Babbage.
- Where?

1013
01:22:30,386 --> 01:22:33,321
It's Babbage!

1014
01:22:33,356 --> 01:22:36,325
(screaming)

1015
01:22:38,628 --> 01:22:40,118
(hisses)
Shut the fuck up!

1016
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:52,570
Shut up!

1017
01:22:52,609 --> 01:22:55,874
Shut the fuck up.
Fuck.

1018
01:23:02,385 --> 01:23:04,683
Custis' voice:
Hey, it's Custis.

1019
01:23:07,290 --> 01:23:10,521
(telephone ringing)

1020
01:23:19,302 --> 01:23:21,395
No, please.

1021
01:23:23,573 --> 01:23:25,598
Custis' voice:
Hey, it's Custis. I'm out.

1022
01:23:25,642 --> 01:23:28,270
Leave a message.
Hoot!

1023
01:23:37,787 --> 01:23:40,255
Put it down!

1024
01:23:40,290 --> 01:23:42,451
He killed Harriet.

1025
01:23:43,827 --> 01:23:47,786
Just put it down.

1026
01:23:51,668 --> 01:23:55,263
I was trying to help.
I didn't mean to hurt him.

1027
01:24:08,518 --> 01:24:10,748
She's not dead.

1028
01:24:10,787 --> 01:24:13,517
Get the fuck out,
you crazy fucking...

1029
01:24:26,603 --> 01:24:29,572
Drop... drop it!

1030
01:24:29,606 --> 01:24:32,336
- Is she okay?
- Yeah.

1031
01:24:33,843 --> 01:24:35,936
Get down.

1032
01:24:35,979 --> 01:24:39,244
Down down.

1033
01:24:39,282 --> 01:24:41,512
Shut up!

1034
01:24:41,551 --> 01:24:43,951
Give me the gun.

1035
01:24:43,987 --> 01:24:45,511
Up!

1036
01:25:03,606 --> 01:25:05,506
You're enjoying this.

1037
01:26:30,393 --> 01:26:32,452
Viola: You gonna return her
to her parents?

1038
01:26:36,399 --> 01:26:38,367
Take me.

1039
01:26:38,401 --> 01:26:40,392
I'll tell 'em
how she died.

1040
01:26:55,985 --> 01:26:58,818
Viola: I always thought something
could have happened between us.

1041
01:27:01,190 --> 01:27:03,750
Maybe I should
have made the first move.

1042
01:27:11,868 --> 01:27:14,598
(laughing)

1043
01:27:17,473 --> 01:27:19,464
Are you gonna do
yourself too?

1044
01:27:20,676 --> 01:27:23,144
Don't make a mess
of it.

1045
01:27:26,482 --> 01:27:28,416
Tell you what.

1046
01:27:28,451 --> 01:27:30,510
Why don't you
go first?

1047
01:27:36,626 --> 01:27:38,150
Please fucking do it now!

1048
01:27:38,194 --> 01:27:41,459
- I am nothing!
- Shut up!

1049
01:27:41,497 --> 01:27:44,523
Shut your fucking mouth!

1050
01:27:59,749 --> 01:28:03,241
Stand up,
stand up!

1051
01:28:15,364 --> 01:28:17,264
Allison: No!

1052
01:28:18,501 --> 01:28:20,867
Errol!

1053
01:28:44,427 --> 01:28:47,362
Okay.

1054
01:28:49,699 --> 01:28:52,634
Okay, yeah.

1055
01:28:58,808 --> 01:29:01,072
Errol...

1056
01:29:01,110 --> 01:29:02,873
there are more.

1057
01:29:02,912 --> 01:29:04,880
There are more
buried here.

1058
01:29:04,914 --> 01:29:07,542
Let me show you.

1059
01:29:07,583 --> 01:29:11,145
Let me show you.
Let me show you!

1060
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,195
(silent)

1061
