1
00:00:02,364 --> 00:00:05,322
I didn't play netball.
Or go to a girls' school.

2
00:00:05,484 --> 00:00:08,954
- Or have showers.
- Now that's just not true, is it?

3
00:00:09,124 --> 00:00:11,035
- Let me start you off.
- No.

4
00:00:11,204 --> 00:00:14,753
If you're gonna be dull, I'm going
to plunge back into Mrs Dalloway,

5
00:00:14,924 --> 00:00:17,996
and you know how she loves that.
Dirty, dirty bitch.

6
00:00:38,804 --> 00:00:40,999
# Here's a new thing

7
00:00:41,164 --> 00:00:42,756
# That's gonna please ya

8
00:00:42,924 --> 00:00:45,313
# Just a little town down in Indonesia

9
00:00:45,524 --> 00:00:46,559
# Bangkok...

10
00:00:46,724 --> 00:00:49,443
Arrived Bangkok. Very hot.

11
00:00:49,604 --> 00:00:53,438
Relieved at last to throw myself
into serious journalistic work.

12
00:00:55,404 --> 00:00:59,397
Thailand has long called travellers
from around the globe

13
00:00:59,564 --> 00:01:03,079
to take spiritual succour
and karmic rest.

14
00:01:03,244 --> 00:01:08,159
For centuries, Western visitors
have been inevitably drawn

15
00:01:08,324 --> 00:01:11,555
to some of Bangkok's oldest sanctuaries.

16
00:01:11,724 --> 00:01:15,160
So true, Bridget. Even I,
fight it as I may, am no exception.

17
00:01:15,324 --> 00:01:19,283
The moment I arrive here,
I almost feel an irresistible pull...

18
00:01:19,444 --> 00:01:23,039
...to this. The Temple of Tranquillity.

19
00:01:23,724 --> 00:01:28,559
Indeed, nothing symbolises Thailand's
extraordinary fusion of East and West,

20
00:01:28,724 --> 00:01:32,000
of tradition and innovation,
better than this.

21
00:01:32,164 --> 00:01:34,314
Fully body-to-body massage.

22
00:01:34,484 --> 00:01:36,793
- Sawatdee kha?
- Sawatdee khrab?

23
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:41,196
An incredible thing about Thailand
is the amazing traditional cuisine.

24
00:01:41,364 --> 00:01:45,243
I'm going to taste kapaluk,
the ultimate delicacy.

25
00:01:47,044 --> 00:01:49,274
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!

26
00:01:49,444 --> 00:01:51,355
Oh, my God. My God.

27
00:01:51,524 --> 00:01:53,958
Um... Er... Mmm.

28
00:01:54,124 --> 00:01:56,513
How about a lovely locust?

29
00:01:56,684 --> 00:01:58,754
I can't. No, no, I can't.

30
00:01:58,924 --> 00:02:00,880
They're delicious.

31
00:02:03,124 --> 00:02:04,477
Oh!

32
00:02:07,324 --> 00:02:12,273
Now that is Ko Panyi, which is
the setting for a very famous Thai poem,

33
00:02:12,444 --> 00:02:14,674
which I think you'd like very much,
Jones.

34
00:02:14,844 --> 00:02:18,883
It's all about a badly-behaved prince
who finds true love with a beautiful,

35
00:02:19,044 --> 00:02:22,116
and as it happens,
very slightly overweight princess.

36
00:02:22,844 --> 00:02:26,280
- You're teasing me.
- I never tease about poetry.

37
00:02:27,004 --> 00:02:30,713
"Oh, Suvarnamali
Why can you not see that I adore you?"

38
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:33,193
"Why do you avoid and scorn me?"

39
00:02:33,364 --> 00:02:35,275
"If you cast me off and leave me

40
00:02:35,444 --> 00:02:37,560
How should I live another day?"

41
00:02:40,444 --> 00:02:44,562
And you thought all I knew of Thailand
was pussies and ping-pong balls.

42
00:02:44,724 --> 00:02:47,636
- You wouldn't sleep with him?
- No, of course not.

43
00:02:47,804 --> 00:02:50,079
Absolutely not.

44
00:02:50,244 --> 00:02:52,235
But he is clever.

45
00:02:52,404 --> 00:02:53,883
- Yes?
- And handsome.

46
00:02:54,044 --> 00:02:57,434
He's also a dysfunctional,
fucked-up, middle-aged, lost boy.

47
00:02:57,604 --> 00:02:59,515
Well, no-one's perfect.

48
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:06,559
I didn't realise you were busy.

49
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:13,873
- He's young enough to be your grandson.
- I know. Isn't that great?

50
00:03:17,204 --> 00:03:21,038
Come on, guys, I've got a very special
treat lined up for lunch.

51
00:03:21,204 --> 00:03:23,479
I'm getting rather fond of Jed,

52
00:03:23,644 --> 00:03:26,875
and I must say he has a genuine interest
in Thai cuisine.

53
00:03:27,044 --> 00:03:30,798
I wouldn't have thought
omelette would be big in Thailand.

54
00:03:30,964 --> 00:03:34,434
- Or mushrooms, for that matter.
- It's magic.

55
00:03:37,204 --> 00:03:40,082
It is a magic mushroom omelette,
isn't it?

56
00:03:40,644 --> 00:03:45,035
Well, that's awful.
There is nothing funny in this at all.

57
00:03:47,124 --> 00:03:49,035
Although, thank God,

58
00:03:49,644 --> 00:03:52,442
the mushrooms don't actually
seem to be working.

59
00:03:57,964 --> 00:04:00,080
# Just what is it
that you want to do?

60
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:05,283
Such lovely colours!

61
00:04:05,444 --> 00:04:08,322
# We wanna get loaded
And we wanna have a good time...

62
00:04:08,484 --> 00:04:13,035
Beautiful Bridget! Beautiful Bridget!
Beautiful Bridget!

63
00:04:15,604 --> 00:04:17,435
Bridget Jones!

64
00:04:20,124 --> 00:04:22,513
Bridget Jones!

65
00:04:22,684 --> 00:04:24,322
But, wait...

66
00:04:24,484 --> 00:04:27,681
- Bridget Jones?
- What sound is that?

67
00:04:33,084 --> 00:04:36,156
It is Daniel Cleaver.

68
00:04:36,324 --> 00:04:40,078
How unutterably beautiful he is.

69
00:04:41,524 --> 00:04:43,913
Jones, what the hell are you doing?

70
00:04:47,324 --> 00:04:50,043
You are lovely colours.

71
00:04:50,964 --> 00:04:53,603
- # I don't wanna lose your love...
- Here.

72
00:04:53,764 --> 00:04:55,755
Here I am.

73
00:04:56,564 --> 00:04:58,953
I think you're completely off your face.

74
00:05:00,284 --> 00:05:02,081
Hey.

75
00:05:02,244 --> 00:05:05,156
Bloody hell.

76
00:05:05,684 --> 00:05:08,596
Oh... Oh, I'm an angel.

77
00:05:09,524 --> 00:05:12,277
Oh. How lovely.

78
00:05:12,444 --> 00:05:14,719
Glorious sand.

79
00:05:14,884 --> 00:05:16,602
Oh.

80
00:05:16,764 --> 00:05:18,880
I want to be naked.

81
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:23,642
- Naked as a baby.
- Come on, then, angel. Up you get.

82
00:05:26,764 --> 00:05:28,675
- All right?
- Mmm.

83
00:05:29,724 --> 00:05:33,080
- How are you feeling?
- Completely embarrassed.

84
00:05:33,244 --> 00:05:36,475
Don't be. You're charming on drugs.
In future, just say yes.

85
00:05:37,284 --> 00:05:42,233
Do you know, I never really understood
why you wanted to go out with me.

86
00:05:43,084 --> 00:05:45,917
- It seemed so unlikely.
- Come on. For God's sake.

87
00:05:46,084 --> 00:05:48,917
You're sexy. You make me laugh.

88
00:05:49,084 --> 00:05:51,393
At you, of course, not with you.

89
00:05:52,044 --> 00:05:54,000
And you were...

90
00:05:54,164 --> 00:05:55,882
...incidentally...

91
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,242
...the best shag...

92
00:05:59,404 --> 00:06:00,962
...I ever had.

93
00:06:01,124 --> 00:06:02,637
The best?

94
00:06:02,804 --> 00:06:06,001
Aside from Simon Reade
in the fifth-form locker room, yeah.

95
00:06:06,964 --> 00:06:09,398
Suppose I said you were pretty good too?

96
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:13,395
Pretty good?

97
00:06:14,444 --> 00:06:16,719
Was I better than Mark Darcy?

98
00:06:17,804 --> 00:06:22,036
By the way, is it true he always says
"I'm sorry, I think I'm going to come"?

99
00:06:22,204 --> 00:06:25,082
- Who told you that?
- It's common knowledge, isn't it?

100
00:06:26,284 --> 00:06:29,003
Come on, Jones. Who gave who the hoof?

101
00:06:29,164 --> 00:06:31,200
And why?

102
00:06:32,324 --> 00:06:34,280
Let's just say

103
00:06:34,444 --> 00:06:37,595
that we suffered
from a fatal incompatibility.

104
00:06:41,164 --> 00:06:43,280
I have missed you, Jones.

105
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:46,083
I don't suppose
there's any circumstances

106
00:06:46,244 --> 00:06:48,519
in which you would ever consider

107
00:06:48,684 --> 00:06:51,357
thinking about trusting me again?

108
00:06:53,924 --> 00:06:55,835
Absolutely not.

109
00:07:02,084 --> 00:07:05,554
Well, I suppose I'll be getting back
to my little hut now.

110
00:07:06,284 --> 00:07:09,720
Thank you very much, Daniel.
I had a nice time.

111
00:07:20,804 --> 00:07:25,082
Is that the Big Dipper
or the little one?

112
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:27,360
I can never tell them apart.

113
00:07:27,524 --> 00:07:29,196
Definitely the big one.

114
00:07:29,364 --> 00:07:32,276
You can't see the little one
this close to the equator.

115
00:07:32,444 --> 00:07:35,959
Oh, please.
You don't know about astronomy.

116
00:07:36,124 --> 00:07:38,558
I most certainly do.
I'm passionate about it.

117
00:07:40,844 --> 00:07:44,553
You know, Jones, if stargazing
is something that interests you,

118
00:07:44,724 --> 00:07:48,637
then it has to be said that the view
from my balcony is quite outstanding.

119
00:07:49,924 --> 00:07:52,757
Perhaps you'd like to come up
and have a little look?

120
00:07:52,924 --> 00:07:54,721
I don't think so.

121
00:07:54,884 --> 00:07:57,921
See over there? Along my arm.

122
00:07:58,084 --> 00:08:00,040
That's it, over there.

123
00:08:01,004 --> 00:08:03,234
That is Orion's Belt.

124
00:08:03,404 --> 00:08:08,478
And next to that is a very sexy little
constellation called Ursa's Maiden.

125
00:08:08,644 --> 00:08:09,633
Ah.

126
00:08:09,804 --> 00:08:13,035
She's being very naughty
and trying to undo Orion's belt.

127
00:08:14,004 --> 00:08:17,917
All right, what about...
that one?

128
00:08:18,884 --> 00:08:21,876
Yes, well that is
a very, very famous star.

129
00:08:22,044 --> 00:08:24,319
Um, right next to, of course, um...

130
00:08:26,444 --> 00:08:30,676
I don't know, some other fucking star
that's been there for years and years.

131
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:34,041
Seen one star, you've seen the lot,
that's what I say, Jones.

132
00:08:37,444 --> 00:08:39,639
Different with girls, though.

133
00:08:41,644 --> 00:08:43,555
Some girls...

134
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:45,635
...are special.

135
00:08:45,804 --> 00:08:47,840
Are they?

136
00:08:48,684 --> 00:08:50,595
I think so.

137
00:09:01,004 --> 00:09:04,076
What is this special power
you hold over me, Jones?

138
00:09:13,204 --> 00:09:15,320
And what about your therapy?

139
00:09:17,044 --> 00:09:19,035
I think you might be it.

140
00:09:19,204 --> 00:09:21,240
# I'm not in love

141
00:09:22,524 --> 00:09:24,435
# So don't forget it

142
00:09:25,884 --> 00:09:28,034
# It's just a silly phase

143
00:09:28,204 --> 00:09:30,115
# I'm going through

144
00:09:32,644 --> 00:09:34,600
# And just because

145
00:09:36,204 --> 00:09:38,115
# I call you up

146
00:09:39,564 --> 00:09:41,236
# Don't get me wrong

147
00:09:41,404 --> 00:09:44,237
# Don't think you've got it made

148
00:09:46,364 --> 00:09:48,275
# I'm not in love...

149
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:51,683
God, I hope you're wearing
those giant panties.

150
00:09:51,844 --> 00:09:52,959
Please.

151
00:09:53,124 --> 00:09:55,957
Please be wearing the giant panties.

152
00:09:56,124 --> 00:09:58,115
Please.

153
00:09:58,284 --> 00:10:00,275
Oh, my old friends.

154
00:10:00,444 --> 00:10:03,083
Oh, Daddy's home.

155
00:10:03,244 --> 00:10:06,919
Did you miss me?
Because Daddy missed you. Yes, he did.

156
00:10:07,684 --> 00:10:09,197
Wait.

157
00:10:11,524 --> 00:10:13,037
Sorry.

158
00:10:13,204 --> 00:10:15,274
Can I just have a minute?

159
00:10:15,444 --> 00:10:17,355
Just a minute.

160
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:27,113
Oh, God.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

161
00:10:27,284 --> 00:10:30,879
# Big boys don't cry
Big boys don't cry

162
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:34,800
# Big boys don't cry
Big boys don't cry...

163
00:10:47,524 --> 00:10:51,119
- Everything all right?
- Yeah, sure.

164
00:10:52,124 --> 00:10:54,160
Just a bit... nervous.

165
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:58,003
I mean, you see,
if I stay with you tonight,

166
00:10:58,164 --> 00:11:02,123
well, it's definitely
the end of something...

167
00:11:02,284 --> 00:11:04,400
important with someone.

168
00:11:04,564 --> 00:11:07,203
Um, which has probably ended already,

169
00:11:07,364 --> 00:11:10,197
- but perhaps...
- Bridge, Bridge Bridge, Bridge.

170
00:11:10,364 --> 00:11:12,673
Doesn't everyone
deserve a second chance?

171
00:11:14,604 --> 00:11:15,957
Hmm?

172
00:11:22,364 --> 00:11:24,116
Except Hitler.

173
00:11:25,724 --> 00:11:28,875
Well, he was very, very, very naughty.

174
00:11:34,844 --> 00:11:36,163
What?

175
00:11:36,324 --> 00:11:39,714
Nothing. Er, come back later, please.
Thank you very much.

176
00:11:43,604 --> 00:11:45,959
Bridge, it's nothing.
Leave it. Leave it.

177
00:11:48,564 --> 00:11:51,032
You made order for 10.30.

178
00:11:51,964 --> 00:11:53,920
Order for what?

179
00:11:54,924 --> 00:11:56,277
Me.

180
00:11:56,444 --> 00:11:58,116
10.30.

181
00:12:01,124 --> 00:12:03,684
You know, I've had it up to here
with this hotel.

182
00:12:03,844 --> 00:12:07,519
- It's been cock-ups like this all week.
- You Mr Cleaver?

183
00:12:07,684 --> 00:12:11,996
Yesterday, you with Maria.
She say you big tipper.

184
00:12:22,484 --> 00:12:24,952
I mean, I'm up for it if you are.

185
00:12:26,044 --> 00:12:29,400
Actually, no, that was stupid.
It's just one little slip.

186
00:12:29,564 --> 00:12:33,079
Don't let it ruin what was gonna be
a fantastic weekend shagathon.

187
00:12:33,244 --> 00:12:36,316
- I don't want a shagathon.
- No, nor do I. Nor do I.

188
00:12:36,484 --> 00:12:39,476
- You're right.
- You're looking for a weekend of sex,

189
00:12:39,644 --> 00:12:42,716
- I'm looking...
- For more. I feel I can change.

190
00:12:42,884 --> 00:12:45,273
- I absolutely can change.
- I need to change.

191
00:12:45,444 --> 00:12:47,560
I can't believe I fell for it again.

192
00:12:47,724 --> 00:12:50,397
Daniel, I really do think

193
00:12:50,564 --> 00:12:53,237
that you should go and fuck yourself.

194
00:12:53,404 --> 00:12:57,113
Or her. But definitely not me.

195
00:12:57,284 --> 00:12:58,763
- # Think
- # Think

196
00:12:58,924 --> 00:13:01,233
# Think about
what you're trying to do to me

197
00:13:01,404 --> 00:13:02,917
- # Think
- # Think think

198
00:13:03,084 --> 00:13:04,233
# Let your mind go...

199
00:13:04,404 --> 00:13:06,964
I can't believe he made up
the sex therapy thing.

200
00:13:07,124 --> 00:13:09,479
Doesn't matter.
I finally learnt my lesson,

201
00:13:09,644 --> 00:13:12,317
and it's an excellent lesson
to have nailed.

202
00:13:12,964 --> 00:13:14,477
- Fuck!
- What?

203
00:13:14,644 --> 00:13:16,919
No fucking room in the fucking suitcase.

204
00:13:17,084 --> 00:13:19,393
There's room in mine. Give me something.

205
00:13:19,564 --> 00:13:21,282
Great.

206
00:13:21,444 --> 00:13:24,754
- What the hell is this?
- It is a fertility-snake bowl.

207
00:13:24,924 --> 00:13:27,233
- Ooh.
- Jed gave it to me.

208
00:13:27,404 --> 00:13:29,315
- # Think think
- # Let your mind go...

209
00:13:29,484 --> 00:13:30,837
How romantic.

210
00:13:31,004 --> 00:13:32,119
# Freedom...

211
00:13:32,284 --> 00:13:36,323
The way I look at it, in everyone's
life, there's a certain amount of shit.

212
00:13:36,484 --> 00:13:38,918
- That's true.
- In the last year,

213
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:41,473
things have turned out pretty shitty.

214
00:13:41,644 --> 00:13:43,714
So logically, mathematically, even,

215
00:13:43,884 --> 00:13:46,717
it's got to be time
for something not shit.

216
00:13:46,884 --> 00:13:51,480
- Like what?
- Maybe Mark will have chucked Rebecca.

217
00:13:51,644 --> 00:13:53,953
And he'll run to my door,

218
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:58,242
fall to his knees,
possibly wearing a wet white shirt,

219
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:00,201
and beg me to come back.

220
00:14:00,364 --> 00:14:01,558
- # Think
- # Think

221
00:14:01,724 --> 00:14:04,443
# Think about
what you're tryin' to do to me...

222
00:14:04,604 --> 00:14:09,917
Yes, I very confidently expect
very, very good times ahead.

223
00:14:10,084 --> 00:14:12,644
Final call
for all passengers to London...

224
00:14:12,804 --> 00:14:15,682
Isn't he cute? Hello.

225
00:14:16,164 --> 00:14:17,677
Hello. Oh...

226
00:14:17,844 --> 00:14:20,722
Seems to be getting a bit excited.

227
00:14:21,324 --> 00:14:22,803
Oh.

228
00:14:22,964 --> 00:14:24,363
Er...

229
00:14:25,644 --> 00:14:28,761
- Bridget!
- It's just a misunderstanding.

230
00:14:28,924 --> 00:14:30,562
Hold the plane.

231
00:14:30,724 --> 00:14:32,476
Hold the plane.

232
00:14:32,644 --> 00:14:34,680
Excuse me! Excuse me!

233
00:14:34,844 --> 00:14:39,474
All remaining passengers
please report to Gate 27 immediately.

234
00:14:47,204 --> 00:14:49,115
It's not mine.

235
00:14:49,284 --> 00:14:51,639
- These yours?
- Yes.

236
00:14:51,804 --> 00:14:53,920
I mean, they're not my favourite pair.

237
00:15:05,924 --> 00:15:07,880
You can't do this. I'm English.

238
00:15:08,044 --> 00:15:10,160
And an award-winning journalist.

239
00:15:10,324 --> 00:15:14,636
Well, maybe not award-winning, but I
have been to lots of award ceremonies.

240
00:15:23,444 --> 00:15:26,277
Hello. Bridget Jones.

241
00:15:28,764 --> 00:15:30,834
Lovely to meet all of you.

242
00:15:32,964 --> 00:15:35,319
Oh, my bloody God and fuck.

243
00:15:35,484 --> 00:15:37,952
I hope they've told
the British ambassador.

244
00:15:38,124 --> 00:15:40,684
Surely Shazzer
would have raised the alert.

245
00:15:40,844 --> 00:15:42,994
Maybe they got Shazzer as well.

246
00:15:49,764 --> 00:15:52,642
Oh, God, 28 hours.

247
00:15:53,484 --> 00:15:55,361
How much longer?

248
00:15:55,524 --> 00:15:58,243
Jones.
Bridget Jones, you come now.

249
00:16:06,964 --> 00:16:10,001
Oharlie Parker-Knowles,
Assistant Oonsul.

250
00:16:10,164 --> 00:16:12,314
Thank God you're here.

251
00:16:14,004 --> 00:16:15,756
Um, shall we...

252
00:16:15,924 --> 00:16:18,916
I really had absolutely
nothing to do with it.

253
00:16:19,084 --> 00:16:20,995
Jed planned the whole thing.

254
00:16:21,164 --> 00:16:24,122
That's why he snogged Shazzer,
who's much older than him

255
00:16:24,284 --> 00:16:26,195
and slightly past her peak.

256
00:16:26,364 --> 00:16:28,798
Yes, he sounds the most frightful shit.

257
00:16:28,964 --> 00:16:30,192
Mmm.

258
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:34,676
The bore is everyone who gets caught
has exactly the same story,

259
00:16:34,844 --> 00:16:39,440
so unless we find this, this Jed fellow
and get a full confession,

260
00:16:39,604 --> 00:16:41,640
you're on a bit of a sticky wicket.

261
00:16:42,244 --> 00:16:44,075
Well, how sticky?

262
00:16:44,244 --> 00:16:46,474
Something like 15 to 20 years.

263
00:16:46,644 --> 00:16:50,080
- 15 years?
- Or maybe ten if we're lucky.

264
00:16:50,244 --> 00:16:52,155
Ten years!

265
00:16:52,324 --> 00:16:54,599
In here?

266
00:17:06,684 --> 00:17:08,720
Very black.

267
00:17:08,884 --> 00:17:12,877
All my life I've had the feeling
something terrible was about to happen.

268
00:17:13,644 --> 00:17:15,760
Now it has.

269
00:17:17,844 --> 00:17:19,755
Bijjit, right?

270
00:17:19,924 --> 00:17:21,801
Bridget, actually.

271
00:17:21,964 --> 00:17:23,716
My name Phrao.

272
00:17:23,884 --> 00:17:25,795
You're my friend?

273
00:17:31,804 --> 00:17:33,795
- Steady on!
- Superbra!

274
00:17:33,964 --> 00:17:37,036
You lend me. One day, two cigarette.

275
00:17:37,844 --> 00:17:39,721
Oh.

276
00:17:39,884 --> 00:17:42,034
Well, I'll think about it.

277
00:17:42,844 --> 00:17:45,074
Actually, I was thinking of giving up,

278
00:17:45,244 --> 00:17:48,554
but that was before I was arrested
and thrown into a Thai prison

279
00:17:48,724 --> 00:17:51,238
for ten to 15 years.

280
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:53,954
Oircumstances change.

281
00:17:55,844 --> 00:17:58,995
No, it really, really is "touched".

282
00:17:59,564 --> 00:18:04,001
"Like a vir-gin,
touched for the very first time".

283
00:18:04,164 --> 00:18:05,643
- No, you wrong.
- No.

284
00:18:05,804 --> 00:18:07,681
# Like a wersion

285
00:18:07,844 --> 00:18:10,597
- Vir-gin.
- # Fucked for the very first time

286
00:18:10,764 --> 00:18:14,313
- Touched.
- # Like a wersion

287
00:18:14,484 --> 00:18:16,554
Ten years of this? I

288
00:18:16,724 --> 00:18:19,443
Stop! Enough. Enough.

289
00:18:19,604 --> 00:18:23,233
If you're going to do it,
you really ought to do it properly.

290
00:18:23,844 --> 00:18:29,043
After all, Madonna is nothing
if not a perfectionist.

291
00:18:29,204 --> 00:18:31,479
Five, six, seven, eight and one...

292
00:18:31,644 --> 00:18:33,839
# Like a virgin

293
00:18:34,764 --> 00:18:38,598
# Touched for the very first time

294
00:18:38,964 --> 00:18:42,673
# Like a virgin

295
00:18:42,844 --> 00:18:45,358
# When your heart beats

296
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:48,243
# Next to mine...

297
00:18:52,444 --> 00:18:54,400
Dear Mum and Dad,

298
00:18:54,564 --> 00:18:56,475
I'm missing you a lot.

299
00:18:56,644 --> 00:18:58,953
Please write as soon as you can.

300
00:19:01,444 --> 00:19:03,594
I'm feeling pretty low.

301
00:19:04,804 --> 00:19:06,760
Bijjit Jone.

302
00:19:10,124 --> 00:19:12,558
In there. You have five minutes.

303
00:19:12,724 --> 00:19:14,442
Just five.

304
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,677
Mark?

305
00:19:28,324 --> 00:19:30,235
You all right?

306
00:19:30,404 --> 00:19:32,838
Oh... Fine.

307
00:19:33,004 --> 00:19:34,642
Hmm.

308
00:19:39,564 --> 00:19:42,397
And... scared shitless.

309
00:19:42,564 --> 00:19:44,520
But, you know, perky.

310
00:19:47,084 --> 00:19:49,473
I can't believe
you've come all this way.

311
00:19:49,644 --> 00:19:52,875
I haven't. I was out here
handling a Foreign Office case

312
00:19:53,044 --> 00:19:54,955
when I heard about your situation.

313
00:19:55,124 --> 00:19:57,513
I haven't done anything wrong.

314
00:19:57,684 --> 00:20:00,198
I promise you, it's all a big mistake.

315
00:20:00,364 --> 00:20:02,753
Yes, well, I'm sure it is.

316
00:20:02,924 --> 00:20:05,961
I've got all the papers here
and I'm sure we can sort it out.

317
00:20:06,124 --> 00:20:10,436
I think about you all the time.
And I'm so sorry,

318
00:20:10,604 --> 00:20:14,756
I really, really am,
for everything that happened between us.

319
00:20:14,924 --> 00:20:16,880
Yes, well...

320
00:20:17,044 --> 00:20:20,719
We don't have much time and I need you
to identify someone for me.

321
00:20:20,884 --> 00:20:24,672
Is this the man with whom you were
seen taking hallucinogenic mushrooms

322
00:20:24,844 --> 00:20:27,404
before you spent the night
with Daniel Oleaver?

323
00:20:27,564 --> 00:20:30,203
Yes, that's him,
but I think you should know...

324
00:20:30,364 --> 00:20:33,401
The same man who gave you
the snake containing the drugs?

325
00:20:33,564 --> 00:20:35,873
Yes, that's him, that's Jed.

326
00:20:36,044 --> 00:20:38,035
But it was Shazzer's snake, not mine,

327
00:20:38,204 --> 00:20:40,399
and as far as Daniel Oleaver goes...

328
00:20:40,564 --> 00:20:43,556
Your sex life doesn't concern me at all.

329
00:20:54,404 --> 00:20:56,838
Has there been any ill treatment here?

330
00:20:57,404 --> 00:21:00,874
No, no. Well, I mean...

331
00:21:01,484 --> 00:21:04,203
...the toilet facilities
are well below par, but...

332
00:21:04,364 --> 00:21:06,275
Good, that makes things simpler.

333
00:21:09,684 --> 00:21:12,756
Listen, they're prepared
to drop all charges against you

334
00:21:12,924 --> 00:21:16,280
which is extremely lenient,
given the circumstances.

335
00:21:16,444 --> 00:21:18,878
You're going to be out within a week.

336
00:21:22,604 --> 00:21:24,037
And...

337
00:21:31,364 --> 00:21:33,116
Goodbye.

338
00:21:37,524 --> 00:21:38,923
Mark?

339
00:21:49,044 --> 00:21:50,841
Thank you.

340
00:21:51,444 --> 00:21:55,278
You're welcome. I'm just the messenger.
The order came from above.

341
00:21:57,244 --> 00:21:59,963
Well, good luck.
Glad I could be of help.

342
00:22:21,724 --> 00:22:23,680
So, Bijjit, what happen?

343
00:22:23,844 --> 00:22:25,880
Well, um...

344
00:22:26,844 --> 00:22:29,039
Bijjit! How this can happen?

345
00:22:29,204 --> 00:22:32,196
This is terrible! You are innocent!

346
00:22:32,364 --> 00:22:35,913
- They're always cheating us.
- No, no, no. That's all fine.

347
00:22:36,084 --> 00:22:39,394
They've dropped the charges
and they're letting me go.

348
00:22:39,564 --> 00:22:41,441
But that good news.

349
00:22:41,604 --> 00:22:43,595
What is wrong?

350
00:22:44,684 --> 00:22:47,357
Mark Darcy definitely...

351
00:22:47,524 --> 00:22:49,992
...doesn't love me anymore.

352
00:22:50,164 --> 00:22:51,916
Ohhh.

353
00:22:52,564 --> 00:22:55,203
You see the trouble is
it was me who chucked him.

354
00:22:55,364 --> 00:22:57,400
He treat you bad?

355
00:22:57,564 --> 00:22:59,475
Yeah, actually, he did.

356
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:01,874
My boyfriend treat me bad too.

357
00:23:02,044 --> 00:23:03,602
- Me too.
- Mine as well.

358
00:23:03,764 --> 00:23:05,117
Me too.

359
00:23:05,284 --> 00:23:08,640
Then you know all about it.
You think you've found the right man,

360
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:11,113
but then there's so much wrong with him

361
00:23:11,284 --> 00:23:15,357
and he finds there's so much wrong
with you and it all just falls apart.

362
00:23:15,524 --> 00:23:17,833
Don't tell me. My boyfriend,

363
00:23:18,004 --> 00:23:19,915
he seem really nice.

364
00:23:20,084 --> 00:23:23,997
Then he start to hit me.
Make me work on street.

365
00:23:24,164 --> 00:23:26,473
My boyfriend, he say he love me.

366
00:23:26,644 --> 00:23:30,273
But he do no work,
and make me work 24 hour a day.

367
00:23:30,444 --> 00:23:32,514
Then he make me take heroin drug.

368
00:23:32,684 --> 00:23:36,199
What about you, Bijjit?
What your bad boyfriend do?

369
00:23:37,604 --> 00:23:39,560
Well, er...

370
00:23:40,364 --> 00:23:44,039
...he really didn't stick up for me
at this lawyers' supper...

371
00:23:44,204 --> 00:23:48,561
and, um, then he would fold his...

372
00:23:50,284 --> 00:23:53,117
Oh, same sort of thing, really.

373
00:23:53,284 --> 00:23:58,119
Hitting me and making me take drugs.
Stealing all my money and stuff.

374
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:02,916
Oh, God.
I've been the world's biggest fool.

375
00:24:08,684 --> 00:24:10,436
Bijjit?

376
00:24:11,364 --> 00:24:14,162
Just a few tiny leaving presents.
No luxuries.

377
00:24:17,804 --> 00:24:20,159
# Living in a material world

378
00:24:20,324 --> 00:24:22,519
# And I am a material girl

379
00:24:22,684 --> 00:24:26,882
# You know that we are living
in a material world

380
00:24:27,044 --> 00:24:29,399
# And I am a material girl

381
00:24:30,644 --> 00:24:33,681
# Living in a material world

382
00:24:33,844 --> 00:24:36,722
# And I am a material girl #

383
00:24:38,044 --> 00:24:40,239
If you want something smooth
on your wall,

384
00:24:40,404 --> 00:24:42,315
you could do worse than John Ourrin.

385
00:24:42,484 --> 00:24:45,521
He is about the only
contemporary painter who can paint.

386
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:48,835
There's usually something
interesting and allegorical,

387
00:24:49,004 --> 00:24:51,882
plus of course,
there is a very high perv quotient.

388
00:24:52,044 --> 00:24:54,353
- Did you see her?
- Out. Out it.

389
00:24:54,524 --> 00:24:56,833
Sorry, everyone, sorry. It's my stalker.

390
00:24:58,044 --> 00:25:00,433
Fuck off, Darcy,
some people have jobs to do.

391
00:25:01,244 --> 00:25:04,793
Did you see her surrounded by police,
dogs, handcuffs?

392
00:25:04,964 --> 00:25:08,320
Oome on, she's a big girl,
she can take care of herself.

393
00:25:08,484 --> 00:25:11,760
I'm only going to ask you one more time.
Did you see her?

394
00:25:11,924 --> 00:25:14,233
You're only gonna ask me one more time?

395
00:25:14,444 --> 00:25:17,880
- You haven't got your wig on now, dear.
- I'll take that as a yes.

396
00:25:18,044 --> 00:25:20,194
Yes, I did see her.

397
00:25:20,364 --> 00:25:23,674
I thought she was smuggling seashells,
or mangoes.

398
00:25:23,844 --> 00:25:25,163
Right.

399
00:25:25,324 --> 00:25:29,476
Right, good.
Will you step outside, please?

400
00:25:29,644 --> 00:25:31,794
Oh, no, it's not possible.

401
00:25:31,964 --> 00:25:35,354
Darcy, do you have any idea
what century we actually live in?

402
00:25:35,524 --> 00:25:38,800
Are you gonna step outside
or am I gonna have to drag you?

403
00:25:38,964 --> 00:25:41,159
I think you're gonna have to drag me.

404
00:25:46,404 --> 00:25:49,794
- You're insane!
- And you're a disgrace, Oleaver.

405
00:25:50,404 --> 00:25:52,520
You're pulling my hair!

406
00:25:52,684 --> 00:25:55,756
I'm not going in the sodding water.

407
00:25:59,084 --> 00:26:03,043
# Touching you
'Cause you're touching me

408
00:26:05,244 --> 00:26:06,916
# I believe in a thing called love

409
00:26:07,084 --> 00:26:08,961
# Just listen to the rhythm of my heart

410
00:26:09,124 --> 00:26:10,557
# There's a chance we can make it now

411
00:26:10,724 --> 00:26:12,555
# We'll be rockin'
till the sun goes down

412
00:26:12,724 --> 00:26:15,841
# I believe in a thing called love

413
00:26:16,004 --> 00:26:18,438
# Oooh-ooh ooh...

414
00:26:18,604 --> 00:26:21,118
- Fuck off!
- No, you're going in, Oleaver!

415
00:26:21,284 --> 00:26:23,957
If I'm going in, you're coming with me.

416
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:25,921
You smug bastard.

417
00:26:28,084 --> 00:26:30,234
- Oh, my God.
- Get up.

418
00:26:33,844 --> 00:26:35,755
Well, what are you gonna do now?

419
00:26:35,924 --> 00:26:38,233
Drown me in 16 inches of water?

420
00:26:38,404 --> 00:26:40,122
Yes, good idea.

421
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:47,962
Fuck! Stop, stop.

422
00:26:48,124 --> 00:26:50,115
Listen, listen, listen...

423
00:26:50,284 --> 00:26:54,436
OK, I left her at the airport.
I shouldn't have done that.

424
00:26:55,404 --> 00:26:57,474
But she bumped into Jed herself

425
00:26:57,644 --> 00:27:00,363
and I didn't fucking well seduce her,
all right?

426
00:27:01,524 --> 00:27:04,118
- You didn't?
- There's something wrong with her.

427
00:27:04,284 --> 00:27:06,036
She's gone all frigid.

428
00:27:06,204 --> 00:27:08,479
I spent the night
with a gorgeous Thai girl.

429
00:27:08,644 --> 00:27:11,363
Who in fact turned out to be
a gorgeous Thai boy.

430
00:27:12,044 --> 00:27:13,443
Satisfied?

431
00:27:16,044 --> 00:27:17,636
Yes.

432
00:27:17,804 --> 00:27:19,317
Thank you.

433
00:27:23,804 --> 00:27:25,715
You know what, mate?

434
00:27:26,324 --> 00:27:30,317
If you're so obsessed with Bridget
Jones, why don't you just marry her?

435
00:27:32,004 --> 00:27:34,313
'Oause then she'd definitely shag me.

436
00:27:36,044 --> 00:27:37,602
# I believe in a thing called love

437
00:27:37,764 --> 00:27:39,436
# Just listen to the rhythm of my heart

438
00:27:39,604 --> 00:27:42,835
# I believe in a thing called love #

439
00:27:43,924 --> 00:27:46,597
- Bridget!
- Bridget! Over here!

440
00:27:48,004 --> 00:27:50,279
- What was it like?
- How did you survive?

441
00:27:50,444 --> 00:27:54,642
Any girl who's been single in London
knows how to handle herself.

442
00:27:54,804 --> 00:27:57,318
- Darling!
- Will you be going back?

443
00:27:57,484 --> 00:28:00,078
Sorry I didn't write.
I've just been so busy.

444
00:28:00,244 --> 00:28:03,077
Hello, darling. You look lovely.

445
00:28:03,244 --> 00:28:05,917
- Skinny, but lovely.
- Oh, thank you.

446
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:09,076
Oh, it's good to be home.

447
00:28:09,244 --> 00:28:11,553
- Oiggy?
- No, no, thanks.

448
00:28:11,724 --> 00:28:14,796
- I've given up again.
- Shame. I find them very useful.

449
00:28:14,964 --> 00:28:19,003
I take great comfort in the fact they
might kill me before things get worse.

450
00:28:27,084 --> 00:28:30,156
The Darcys rang to say how pleased
they were you were out.

451
00:28:30,964 --> 00:28:33,683
I rather thought Mark might be here
to meet you.

452
00:28:33,844 --> 00:28:36,233
Yes, but you must remember we split up.

453
00:28:36,404 --> 00:28:38,599
So no hope there?

454
00:28:38,764 --> 00:28:40,675
No hope there.

455
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:45,679
Believe me,
next time I will not fuck it up, Mum.

456
00:28:45,844 --> 00:28:47,960
- Language, darling.
- Sorry.

457
00:28:49,044 --> 00:28:52,480
Next time, I will not fuck it up...

458
00:28:53,084 --> 00:28:55,314
...Mother.

459
00:28:57,804 --> 00:28:59,920
# Trying to be misunderstood

460
00:29:04,244 --> 00:29:07,759
# But it doesn't do me any good

461
00:29:12,004 --> 00:29:15,599
# Love the way they smiled at me

462
00:29:15,764 --> 00:29:19,154
# Hold that face for eternity

463
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:23,758
# Now let them all fly off

464
00:29:26,764 --> 00:29:29,756
# When it comes down

465
00:29:30,284 --> 00:29:33,879
# It all comes down

466
00:29:35,164 --> 00:29:38,793
# And you will not be found

467
00:29:42,044 --> 00:29:45,036
# When it's over

468
00:29:45,604 --> 00:29:48,676
# It's all over

469
00:29:50,604 --> 00:29:53,755
# Even if I make a sound...

470
00:30:00,644 --> 00:30:02,236
Surprise!

471
00:30:02,404 --> 00:30:04,235
- Hello.
- Hello.

472
00:30:04,404 --> 00:30:06,315
- Oh, darling.
- Hiya.

473
00:30:07,004 --> 00:30:08,437
Bridget...

474
00:30:08,604 --> 00:30:10,481
I'm so sorry.

475
00:30:12,004 --> 00:30:14,120
It's all right.

476
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:21,312
Well, thank God for Mark Darcy.
I mean, he might be a boring arse,

477
00:30:21,484 --> 00:30:23,520
but he performed a miracle.

478
00:30:24,764 --> 00:30:27,153
That's a bit of an overstatement.

479
00:30:27,804 --> 00:30:30,398
He actually seems
to be the villain of this piece.

480
00:30:31,004 --> 00:30:35,634
He's a top human rights lawyer and he
left it to someone else to get me out.

481
00:30:35,804 --> 00:30:37,840
He was just a messenger.

482
00:30:38,804 --> 00:30:41,523
- Who told you that?
- He did.

483
00:30:41,684 --> 00:30:43,675
Straight from the horse's mouth.

484
00:30:44,524 --> 00:30:47,163
The horse wasn't quite
telling you the truth.

485
00:30:47,324 --> 00:30:49,633
I called Mark
the minute I landed in London.

486
00:30:49,804 --> 00:30:52,159
We went to his office
and within half an hour,

487
00:30:52,324 --> 00:30:55,202
he'd woken two Oabinet ministers
and half of Ml5.

488
00:30:55,364 --> 00:30:59,277
But none of them could locate Jed,
so Mark flew over to Interpol.

489
00:30:59,444 --> 00:31:01,719
Which is in Lyon.
They located Jed in Dubai,

490
00:31:01,884 --> 00:31:04,398
but they don't normally
extradite people,

491
00:31:04,564 --> 00:31:07,795
so Mark rang the Home Secretary
who rang our ambassador...

492
00:31:07,964 --> 00:31:11,115
In Riyadh. Then Mark flew to Dubai
where he identified Jed,

493
00:31:11,284 --> 00:31:13,559
who was impounded and pushed out into...

494
00:31:13,724 --> 00:31:16,602
Saudi Arabia, where Mark was waiting
with the police.

495
00:31:16,764 --> 00:31:20,996
Jed was arrested and extradited back
to Britain. Then Mark flew to Bangkok,

496
00:31:21,164 --> 00:31:24,156
to make damn sure they'd let you go.

497
00:31:25,044 --> 00:31:26,602
Oh.

498
00:31:30,684 --> 00:31:33,323
He was just angry about Daniel Oleaver.

499
00:31:35,924 --> 00:31:38,802
- He must still love me.
- He fucking must.

500
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:41,082
Taxi?

501
00:31:41,244 --> 00:31:42,518
Yes, please.

502
00:31:46,484 --> 00:31:48,600
Get in the cab!

503
00:31:52,124 --> 00:31:53,716
Hurry!

504
00:32:17,044 --> 00:32:20,639
Oh. I forgot about you.

505
00:32:21,684 --> 00:32:24,562
Er, I, I, I just wanted to, um...

506
00:32:24,724 --> 00:32:26,760
say something to Mark.

507
00:32:26,924 --> 00:32:29,199
He's at the office.
Do you want to come in?

508
00:32:30,444 --> 00:32:33,675
Oh, no. No, no, I don't think I will.

509
00:32:34,964 --> 00:32:38,240
I really hope
that you'll be happy together.

510
00:32:38,404 --> 00:32:40,440
- Sorry?
- You and Mark.

511
00:32:40,604 --> 00:32:44,392
I really hope that you'll be
very happy together.

512
00:32:44,564 --> 00:32:46,555
No, no, no, Bridget, listen...

513
00:32:46,724 --> 00:32:49,033
you've got it completely wrong.

514
00:32:49,204 --> 00:32:51,399
I'm not in love with him.

515
00:32:51,564 --> 00:32:53,759
How could I be when I'm...

516
00:32:53,924 --> 00:32:56,961
seriously heartbroken
and smitten with someone else?

517
00:32:58,244 --> 00:33:00,235
Someone else?

518
00:33:00,404 --> 00:33:03,077
- You, Bridget.
- Me?

519
00:33:03,684 --> 00:33:07,154
Ever since I saw you here
with your hair messed that night

520
00:33:07,324 --> 00:33:10,157
and bits of garden stuck to you.
You must have noticed.

521
00:33:10,324 --> 00:33:14,442
I try to hide it,
but every time I see you, I light up.

522
00:33:16,524 --> 00:33:18,799
I thought you were just, you know...

523
00:33:19,804 --> 00:33:20,953
...lying.

524
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:23,194
Was every look I ever gave you a lie?

525
00:33:23,364 --> 00:33:25,036
I've been looking forward to this.

526
00:33:25,204 --> 00:33:27,434
Lovely to see you, Bridget.

527
00:33:44,724 --> 00:33:46,794
Thank you very much.

528
00:33:48,244 --> 00:33:50,280
That was lovely.

529
00:33:51,564 --> 00:33:53,316
Really lovely.

530
00:33:53,484 --> 00:33:55,918
But I'm afraid it's still men
in general,

531
00:33:56,084 --> 00:33:59,759
and Mark Darcy in particular,
that I love.

532
00:34:00,164 --> 00:34:01,438
Right.

533
00:34:03,324 --> 00:34:07,112
If, er, if I ever do decide to, um...

534
00:34:07,604 --> 00:34:10,323
you know, bat for the other side...

535
00:34:11,644 --> 00:34:13,953
...well, there's no-one else.

536
00:34:14,604 --> 00:34:15,923
Only you.

537
00:34:23,404 --> 00:34:26,043
- Hello, Giles.
- Hello, Bridget.

538
00:34:27,644 --> 00:34:29,680
# Open up your eyes

539
00:34:29,844 --> 00:34:31,482
# Then you'll realise

540
00:34:31,644 --> 00:34:33,282
# Here I stand with my

541
00:34:33,444 --> 00:34:35,275
# Everlasting love

542
00:34:35,444 --> 00:34:37,241
# Need you by my side

543
00:34:37,404 --> 00:34:39,042
# Girl, to be my bride

544
00:34:39,204 --> 00:34:40,796
# You'll never be denied...

545
00:34:40,964 --> 00:34:43,432
Inns of Oourt, please. Fast as you can.

546
00:34:47,444 --> 00:34:49,958
What do you think of this jacket?

547
00:34:50,124 --> 00:34:52,638
- Yeah, very nice indeed.
- No, be honest.

548
00:34:52,804 --> 00:34:56,035
What do you think of the whole
jacket/trouser combination?

549
00:34:56,604 --> 00:35:00,438
- Disaster.
- Actually, can we take a tiny detour?

550
00:35:01,404 --> 00:35:04,043
I'll be back in literally two seconds.

551
00:35:05,684 --> 00:35:07,720
# Where life really flows

552
00:35:07,884 --> 00:35:09,363
# No-one really knows

553
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:11,037
# Till someone's there to show

554
00:35:11,204 --> 00:35:12,876
# The way to lasting love

555
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:16,400
# Need a love to last forever

556
00:35:16,844 --> 00:35:20,075
# Need a love to last forever...

557
00:35:25,924 --> 00:35:27,596
Oh.

558
00:35:38,724 --> 00:35:40,316
# You're the first

559
00:35:40,484 --> 00:35:42,122
# The last

560
00:35:42,284 --> 00:35:44,161
# My everything

561
00:35:45,724 --> 00:35:47,840
# And the answer to

562
00:35:48,564 --> 00:35:50,634
# All my dreams

563
00:35:53,004 --> 00:35:54,517
# You're my sun

564
00:35:54,684 --> 00:35:56,163
# My moon

565
00:35:57,644 --> 00:35:59,396
# My guiding star

566
00:36:00,964 --> 00:36:03,273
# My kind of wonderful

567
00:36:04,564 --> 00:36:06,282
# That's what you are...

568
00:36:07,644 --> 00:36:09,999
- You look gorgeous.
- Thank you.

569
00:36:10,164 --> 00:36:12,678
Very important at this moment.

570
00:36:14,364 --> 00:36:16,480
# There's no way

571
00:36:16,884 --> 00:36:19,193
# They could have made two...

572
00:36:20,404 --> 00:36:22,554
Doesn't matter. It's not about looks.

573
00:36:25,124 --> 00:36:28,514
- # Your love I'll keep for evermore
- As I was saying.

574
00:36:28,684 --> 00:36:30,003
# You're the first...

575
00:36:30,644 --> 00:36:33,681
Excuse me, I'm looking for Mr Darcy.

576
00:36:33,844 --> 00:36:36,961
Down there, right along the corridor,
and just to the left.

577
00:36:37,124 --> 00:36:38,842
Thank you very much.

578
00:36:48,244 --> 00:36:50,758
# Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh no no

579
00:36:50,924 --> 00:36:52,880
# Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh no no

580
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:55,160
# Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh no no

581
00:36:55,324 --> 00:36:57,394
# Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh no no...

582
00:36:58,924 --> 00:37:01,677
I love you.
I always have and I always will.

583
00:37:04,564 --> 00:37:06,600
Oh, um...

584
00:37:06,764 --> 00:37:09,961
I don't love you,
and I never have, and...

585
00:37:10,524 --> 00:37:12,958
...I never will. Sorry.

586
00:37:22,804 --> 00:37:24,522
Oome in.

587
00:37:29,844 --> 00:37:31,880
Hello, Bridget.

588
00:37:32,044 --> 00:37:33,955
Hello, Mark.

589
00:37:34,484 --> 00:37:36,236
Er...

590
00:37:36,924 --> 00:37:38,801
I'm sorry, I'm disturbing you.

591
00:37:40,924 --> 00:37:43,677
- Well, yes, a bit.
- I'll just...

592
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:45,960
sit outside while you finish.

593
00:37:46,124 --> 00:37:50,322
No, no, no, please,
say what you have to say, young lady.

594
00:37:51,284 --> 00:37:54,481
Mr Santiago
is the Peruvian Secretary for Trade.

595
00:37:55,084 --> 00:37:57,279
And Mr Hernández is his number two.

596
00:37:58,324 --> 00:38:00,280
Hello.

597
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:01,923
Hello.

598
00:38:02,684 --> 00:38:04,720
Hello, hello, hello.

599
00:38:09,004 --> 00:38:11,234
How can we help you, young lady?

600
00:38:12,324 --> 00:38:13,996
Well, er...

601
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:17,040
Er...

602
00:38:17,204 --> 00:38:19,843
I just wanted to tell Mr Darcy here

603
00:38:20,004 --> 00:38:24,680
that I heard what magnificent work

604
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:27,722
he actually did
releasing me from prison.

605
00:38:30,044 --> 00:38:35,801
Tiny, tiny misunderstanding to do
with an enormous stash of cocaine.

606
00:38:35,964 --> 00:38:38,524
And I also wanted to say,

607
00:38:38,684 --> 00:38:42,723
since having found out that his
girlfriend is actually a lesbian...

608
00:38:46,004 --> 00:38:47,676
...that I love him.

609
00:38:50,684 --> 00:38:53,676
Always have. Always will.

610
00:38:55,044 --> 00:38:57,797
And that I'm...

611
00:38:58,884 --> 00:39:00,317
...you know...

612
00:39:00,884 --> 00:39:02,840
...available for dates...

613
00:39:03,444 --> 00:39:05,958
...if he should feel so inclined.

614
00:39:10,364 --> 00:39:12,924
So, er, your girlfriend is a lesbian.

615
00:39:14,164 --> 00:39:17,634
Look, if you'll all just excuse us
for a second...

616
00:39:18,244 --> 00:39:19,962
I think we should...

617
00:39:37,444 --> 00:39:41,153
Bridget, that was not the most romantic
proposition I've ever heard.

618
00:39:42,124 --> 00:39:44,638
Well, maybe it is romantic

619
00:39:44,804 --> 00:39:47,113
because it's not. I mean...

620
00:39:47,284 --> 00:39:50,879
I know there's no music playing,
and it's not snowing,

621
00:39:51,804 --> 00:39:57,117
but that doesn't mean that it,
that it can't really be something.

622
00:39:59,284 --> 00:40:01,195
You're right.

623
00:40:03,124 --> 00:40:06,082
In fact, there's a question
I've been meaning to ask you.

624
00:40:06,244 --> 00:40:09,361
All right. As long as it's not
"Will you marry me?"

625
00:40:15,804 --> 00:40:19,035
Oh, God.
It is "Will you marry me?"

626
00:40:19,204 --> 00:40:21,434
Well, I'm not gonna say it now.

627
00:40:21,604 --> 00:40:24,164
- Is it "Will you marry me?"
- The moment's gone.

628
00:40:24,324 --> 00:40:26,440
No. No, no, no. No, wait.

629
00:40:27,204 --> 00:40:28,762
Wait.

630
00:40:28,924 --> 00:40:30,243
- Bridget.
- Start again.

631
00:40:30,404 --> 00:40:32,360
- No.
- Start again.

632
00:40:32,524 --> 00:40:34,435
I'm not gonna... It's...

633
00:40:34,604 --> 00:40:37,960
We've just stepped out
into the corridor,

634
00:40:38,124 --> 00:40:40,240
you say "I've got a question to ask you"

635
00:40:40,404 --> 00:40:42,520
and I don't say anything.

636
00:40:48,084 --> 00:40:50,234
And... And...

637
00:40:51,284 --> 00:40:52,876
You say...

638
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:03,443
Bridget Jones, will you marry me?

639
00:41:23,884 --> 00:41:27,559
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here this day

640
00:41:27,724 --> 00:41:30,284
to unite this couple.

641
00:41:30,844 --> 00:41:33,802
Do you affirm your love,
one to the other?

642
00:41:34,804 --> 00:41:36,999
I do. Again.

643
00:41:37,164 --> 00:41:38,961
And Oolin?

644
00:41:39,124 --> 00:41:40,955
I do. Again.

645
00:41:41,524 --> 00:41:43,560
As well. Of course.

646
00:41:47,404 --> 00:41:51,113
# I've been really tryin', baby...

647
00:41:53,004 --> 00:41:56,792
December 31st, year-end summary.

648
00:41:56,964 --> 00:41:59,000
Prison stays, one.

649
00:41:59,164 --> 00:42:01,803
Lesbian kisses, one.

650
00:42:01,964 --> 00:42:04,239
Pounds lost, minus one.

651
00:42:04,404 --> 00:42:08,716
Boyfriends lost but then regained
following major diplomatic incident,

652
00:42:08,884 --> 00:42:10,875
one.

653
00:42:11,044 --> 00:42:13,842
Marriage proposals, one.

654
00:42:14,004 --> 00:42:16,393
An excellent year's progress.

655
00:42:16,564 --> 00:42:21,354
Bridget Jones has cocked things up
for the very last time.

656
00:42:26,684 --> 00:42:28,914
# Your love is king

657
00:42:29,884 --> 00:42:31,920
# Crown you in my heart

658
00:42:32,084 --> 00:42:34,040
# Your love is king

659
00:42:35,004 --> 00:42:36,676
# Never need to part

660
00:42:36,844 --> 00:42:39,233
# Your kisses ring

661
00:42:40,124 --> 00:42:42,684
# Round and round and round my head

662
00:42:42,844 --> 00:42:45,039
# Touching the very part of me

663
00:42:45,204 --> 00:42:47,399
# It's making my soul sing

664
00:42:47,564 --> 00:42:49,998
# Tearing the very heart of me

665
00:42:50,164 --> 00:42:52,359
# I'm crying out for more

666
00:42:52,524 --> 00:42:54,401
# Your love is king

667
00:42:55,484 --> 00:42:57,315
# Crown you in my heart

668
00:42:57,484 --> 00:42:59,600
# Your love is king...

669
00:42:59,764 --> 00:43:04,554
So, as you can see,
I have found my happy ending at last.

670
00:43:04,724 --> 00:43:09,639
And I truly believe
that happiness is possible.

671
00:43:12,364 --> 00:43:16,357
Even when you're 33 and have a bottom
the size of two bowling balls.

672
00:43:16,524 --> 00:43:19,914
# Your love is real #

673
00:43:32,884 --> 00:43:35,273
# Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh no no

674
00:43:35,444 --> 00:43:37,514
# Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh no no

675
00:43:37,684 --> 00:43:39,879
# Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh no no

676
00:43:40,044 --> 00:43:42,035
# Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh no no

677
00:43:46,884 --> 00:43:49,239
# I look and stare so deep in your eyes

678
00:43:49,404 --> 00:43:51,554
# Touch on you more and more every time

679
00:43:51,724 --> 00:43:53,874
# When you leave
I'm begging you not to go

680
00:43:54,044 --> 00:43:56,114
# Call your name
two, three times in a row

681
00:43:56,284 --> 00:43:58,479
# Such a funny thing for me
to try to explain

682
00:43:58,644 --> 00:44:01,158
# How I'm feeling
and my pride is the one to blame

683
00:44:01,324 --> 00:44:03,201
# 'Cause I know I don't understand

684
00:44:03,364 --> 00:44:05,798
# Just how your love can do
what no-one else can

685
00:44:05,964 --> 00:44:07,477
# Got me lookin'so crazy right now

686
00:44:07,644 --> 00:44:09,680
# Your love's got me lookin'so crazy
right now

687
00:44:09,844 --> 00:44:11,960
# Your love's
Got me lookin'so crazy right now

688
00:44:12,124 --> 00:44:14,433
# Your touch got me lookin'so crazy
right now

689
00:44:14,604 --> 00:44:16,754
# Your love's
Got me hopin'you'll page me right now

690
00:44:16,924 --> 00:44:19,233
# Your kiss got me hoping
you'll save me right now

691
00:44:19,404 --> 00:44:21,315
# Lookin'so crazy
Your love's got me lookin'

692
00:44:21,484 --> 00:44:23,839
# Got me lookin'so crazy in love

693
00:44:24,164 --> 00:44:26,314
# Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh no no

694
00:44:26,484 --> 00:44:28,634
# Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh no no

695
00:44:28,804 --> 00:44:30,954
# Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh no no

696
00:44:31,124 --> 00:44:33,274
# Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh no no...

697
00:44:40,724 --> 00:44:43,284
# Hearts gone astray

698
00:44:43,444 --> 00:44:46,675
# Deep in her when they go

699
00:44:48,164 --> 00:44:50,359
# I went away

700
00:44:50,524 --> 00:44:53,960
# Just when you needed me so

701
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:57,714
# You won't regret

702
00:44:57,884 --> 00:45:01,194
# I'll come back begging you

703
00:45:01,684 --> 00:45:02,719
# Hmm

704
00:45:02,884 --> 00:45:04,761
# Won't you forget

705
00:45:04,924 --> 00:45:10,840
# Welcome love we once knew

706
00:45:12,404 --> 00:45:15,919
# Open up your eyes
Then you'll realise

707
00:45:16,084 --> 00:45:19,315
# Here I stand with my everlasting love

708
00:45:19,484 --> 00:45:23,079
# I need you by my side
Girl to be my pride

709
00:45:23,244 --> 00:45:31,401
# You'll never be denied
everlasting love

710
00:45:33,844 --> 00:45:36,312
# Hearts gone astray

711
00:45:36,484 --> 00:45:39,681

712
00:45:40,964 --> 00:45:43,239

722
00:46:19,804 --> 00:46:23,479
# From the very start
Open up your heart

723
00:46:23,644 --> 00:46:33,792
# Feel that you fall in everlasting love

724
00:46:33,964 --> 00:46:37,639
# Need a love to last forever

725
00:46:37,804 --> 00:46:41,274
# Need a love to last forever

726
00:46:41,444 --> 00:46:44,834
