1
00:00:08,125 --> 00:00:14,881
"How Lionel gave me sex"
by Henry McCanthy read by David.

2
00:00:15,007 --> 00:00:18,553
"I must say thanks to all
at West Rockville High School. "

3
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:24,141
"Without the experience I would not
being a writer. "

4
00:00:24,266 --> 00:00:29,228
"Few are paid to write about it,
they wish had happened. "

5
00:00:30,438 --> 00:00:35,609
"Yes. Cheerleader Girls,
sports guys, the nerds "-

6
00:00:35,734 --> 00:00:39,614
- "Gays who would soon come
out of the closet, and teachers "-

7
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:42,992
- "Has been
to shape me. "

8
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:00,134
"One day I will return
to thank everyone personally. "

9
00:01:00,259 --> 00:01:04,597
"And of course, Lionel,
which showed me how to do. "

10
00:01:11,269 --> 00:01:15,399
We come too late. So late
you need to count your toes with.

11
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,945
After 20 years
Henry should be retrieved at the gate.

12
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:26,494
Listen, wino. When Henry asks us
about his book, we're at it.

13
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:35,293
"A fictional story about a teenager
way through the difficult time at school. "

14
00:01:35,418 --> 00:01:36,919
Sounds like facts.

15
00:01:37,045 --> 00:01:42,551
"Chapter one. " Say You, Say Me '
Pine, your name is high school. "

16
00:01:42,676 --> 00:01:45,888
"The first day of school
I felt alone. "

17
00:01:46,012 --> 00:01:49,431
"I was a nerd,
the invisible "-

18
00:01:49,556 --> 00:01:52,851
- "Until I met
Bryan and Wayne. "

19
00:01:52,976 --> 00:01:57,899
"We figured out that scum
was safer in a group. "

20
00:01:59,441 --> 00:02:02,068
"Crowd gave reassurance. "

21
00:02:02,944 --> 00:02:04,614
Good to see you.

22
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:08,117
How do I sign? You look great.
- What a hairdo...

23
00:02:08,242 --> 00:02:13,080
Your luggage?
- Are gone. Let's just run.

24
00:02:13,205 --> 00:02:17,333
Imagine...
- Is this your car?

25
00:02:19,419 --> 00:02:23,715
There's the wino!
- Yes!

26
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,591
Hello.

27
00:02:25,716 --> 00:02:29,220
"Hours of bored me.
Nobody knew who I was "-

28
00:02:29,346 --> 00:02:35,060
- "Other than my two friends
and football guy who threatened me. "

29
00:02:35,851 --> 00:02:39,731
I told you.
It is dangerous in traffic.

30
00:02:39,856 --> 00:02:43,734
Now here we are almost there.
Gay, dear gay.

31
00:02:46,196 --> 00:02:49,740
Thanks, guys.
- Remember balloons.

32
00:02:49,865 --> 00:02:52,868
One for Henry, me and wino.

33
00:02:53,869 --> 00:02:55,956
What time tomorrow?

34
00:02:57,081 --> 00:03:01,001
Six o'clock.
- Av it!

35
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:10,177
Zombie Early. See you.
- Welcome home Henry. See you!

36
00:03:14,514 --> 00:03:17,810
My little treasure has come home.
- Hi, Mom.

37
00:03:18,686 --> 00:03:20,646
"Hi, mom... "

38
00:03:20,771 --> 00:03:25,483
How are you?
- Fine.

39
00:03:25,608 --> 00:03:29,488
Do not have laundry?
- Yes, but the baggage smoke to Tokyo.

40
00:03:29,613 --> 00:03:31,574
I'm sorry.

41
00:03:31,699 --> 00:03:33,908
Then we shop!

42
00:03:34,034 --> 00:03:36,285
How's the father?

43
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:39,956
"I was a stranger
in a foreign country. "

44
00:03:40,081 --> 00:03:43,877
"Mom treated me like a child
and dad was obsessed with his hobby. "

45
00:03:44,002 --> 00:03:47,380
Hi, Dad. Nice to see you.
- Hello.

46
00:03:48,297 --> 00:03:50,759
What do you want to eat?

47
00:03:50,884 --> 00:03:55,513
I'm not hungry. I must
up early to write the speech.

48
00:03:55,638 --> 00:04:00,268
Pancakes or waffles in the morning?
- Waffles.

49
00:04:00,393 --> 00:04:06,858
"After graduation I took the toothbrush
and a pair of shoes and fled. "

50
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,069
"But I left
a big question. "

51
00:04:12,905 --> 00:04:17,033
"I knew
that one day I might find the answer. "

52
00:04:17,158 --> 00:04:18,786
JAVIER

53
00:04:19,828 --> 00:04:22,580
Hello.
- How are you?

54
00:04:23,832 --> 00:04:27,585
I'm in the room.
Wait until the connection is poor.

55
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:33,926
I have read about your broken heart
and know the place brings back memories.

56
00:04:34,051 --> 00:04:38,846
I'm your agent.
Call, I'll come.

57
00:04:38,971 --> 00:04:42,600
Yes, I understand, Javier.
Vitale know. Hello.

58
00:04:52,234 --> 00:04:59,116
In listening to John John,
KRAC 88.1, station...

59
00:05:13,422 --> 00:05:19,427
"Girls were mysteries. How
I had to smell and talk to them? "

60
00:05:19,553 --> 00:05:24,307
"And the clothes? Varde to boxer shorts
or tight underpants? "

61
00:05:24,432 --> 00:05:31,440
"I spent too tight. My Testicles
was not as developed as others. "

62
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:38,488
"Then I discovered Lionel. He was
chewy and knew things about women. "

63
00:05:38,613 --> 00:05:42,909
"Lionel said, 'You mean more
than words can express? "

64
00:05:43,034 --> 00:05:47,412
"And:"... you are the rain,
makes me foolhardy '"

65
00:05:47,538 --> 00:05:51,167
"He was my crash course
from having sex. "

66
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:58,048
Good morning.

67
00:05:59,716 --> 00:06:02,345
Sexy is fashionable again.

68
00:06:03,971 --> 00:06:09,351
KRAC 88.1.
We have had visits -

69
00:06:09,476 --> 00:06:13,480
- Of our local success writer
Henry McCanthy.

70
00:06:13,605 --> 00:06:17,025
Let's talk about the book
"How Lionel gave me sex. "

71
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:20,863
It is a serious insight
in miserable teenage love.

72
00:06:20,988 --> 00:06:25,700
Cheerleader Girl...
She was a real heartbreaker?

73
00:06:25,825 --> 00:06:28,912
I mention no names.
- Has she read the book?

74
00:06:29,037 --> 00:06:31,998
It would surprise me.

75
00:06:32,123 --> 00:06:34,376
Thanks, Henry.

76
00:06:34,501 --> 00:06:40,382
We're back after jingle.
As you know, I called John John.

77
00:06:44,177 --> 00:06:49,557
I will have T-bones teak and eggs.
Through Fried.

78
00:06:50,683 --> 00:06:56,815
It was all... And pancakes
with strawberries without cream.

79
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,150
Only a little whipped cream.

80
00:06:59,275 --> 00:07:03,904
Anything else?
- No, that was all.

81
00:07:04,029 --> 00:07:06,824
I do not eat it all.

82
00:07:06,949 --> 00:07:10,327
Is Mike Miller?
He recognized us.

83
00:07:10,452 --> 00:07:14,331
He recognized you.
He has worked in this two years.

84
00:07:14,456 --> 00:07:19,252
Stephanie works in the bank
and Josh in the dry cleaner.

85
00:07:19,378 --> 00:07:21,004
On Main Street?

86
00:07:21,129 --> 00:07:26,384
The entire class of 1988 are scattered
all over Rockville.

87
00:07:26,509 --> 00:07:30,722
If you see someone in a store
avoiding the one -

88
00:07:30,847 --> 00:07:34,142
as if one divides
a dark secret with them.

89
00:07:34,267 --> 00:07:40,565
Looking not each other, need
not ashamed of her life.

90
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:46,362
It is embarrassing and self-destructive.
Big Girl would not help it.

91
00:07:47,572 --> 00:07:50,074
How about Scarlet Smith?

92
00:07:53,077 --> 00:07:55,621
What? Come on.

93
00:07:55,747 --> 00:07:58,540
Oh no. No, no, no.

94
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:03,963
I'm just asking.
- Your pathetic wretch.

95
00:08:04,089 --> 00:08:07,299
You must not.

96
00:08:08,467 --> 00:08:13,222
Forget it.
- Yes, and you should too.

97
00:08:13,347 --> 00:08:18,018
Forget it. Henry?
- Forget that I asked.

98
00:08:22,814 --> 00:08:26,443
Our school. What happened?
- It's gone!

99
00:08:26,568 --> 00:08:30,655
They tore it down to avoid being
reminded of all the destroyed lives.

100
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:35,118
Let's go inside.
- I do not go there. Nope.

101
00:08:35,911 --> 00:08:40,748
Teenagers are being tortured there.
I never go there.

102
00:08:40,873 --> 00:08:44,251
Wish me luck.
See you in 45 minutes.

103
00:08:44,376 --> 00:08:46,796
45?
- Yes.

104
00:08:46,921 --> 00:08:49,007
Pull your pants up

105
00:08:57,181 --> 00:09:00,017
Now is the min.

106
00:09:03,562 --> 00:09:06,189
What is it?
- Guess.

107
00:09:06,315 --> 00:09:08,733
Come on.

108
00:09:13,697 --> 00:09:15,782
It is a pen.

109
00:09:17,535 --> 00:09:20,746
Silence!
and keep the queue moving.

110
00:09:29,254 --> 00:09:34,884
Henry!
- Rector. Thanks for your invitation.

111
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:39,264
When I heard that an old student
had been successful author-

112
00:09:39,389 --> 00:09:44,477
examination was elected speaker,
but I have not read the books.

113
00:09:44,602 --> 00:09:49,858
You show
what a girl or a boy can achieve...

114
00:09:49,983 --> 00:09:53,944
...When they have taken their exams.
- Thanks.

115
00:09:54,069 --> 00:10:00,617
You are a true winner.
Students will hear a winning speech.

116
00:10:00,742 --> 00:10:04,955
Yes, they have to.
- Using final premises...

117
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:10,252
...Such as library
canteen or sports premises.

118
00:10:10,377 --> 00:10:13,839
What makes you feel
exam mood.

119
00:10:13,964 --> 00:10:18,176
Okay.
Should I follow some guidelines?

120
00:10:18,302 --> 00:10:25,767
No profanity. We will not offend
someone, so avoid "hell", "penis"...

121
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:30,563
We will, as said
not offend anyone.

122
00:10:30,688 --> 00:10:32,565
No, we will not.

123
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:34,693
I forgot something.

124
00:10:34,818 --> 00:10:40,532
Here are some examples of speeches
some of my favorite speeches.

125
00:10:40,657 --> 00:10:46,370
Look at them. Think of the Gettysburg speech,
Martin Luther, "let us agree" -

126
00:10:46,495 --> 00:10:50,959
or Bette Midler
"Wind Beneath My Wings".

127
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:56,839
What you believe will strengthen
and spicing up the students.

128
00:10:56,964 --> 00:11:00,634
Give them confidence
and willingness to read on.

129
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:02,469
Naturally.

130
00:11:02,594 --> 00:11:07,016
Departure Students arrange it all.

131
00:11:07,141 --> 00:11:12,688
Talk to them when you have spoken
with me, which is now... Local 502nd

132
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:31,373
I know
that I have much to do -

133
00:11:31,498 --> 00:11:35,961
- But this is important
for school leavers.

134
00:11:36,544 --> 00:11:40,173
Oh no... Mrs. Looch...
- What do you want?

135
00:11:40,298 --> 00:11:45,220
Rector has sent me.
- Sit down. We'll talk after class.

136
00:11:45,345 --> 00:11:49,932
Everyone must be involved
and spend some more time.

137
00:11:50,057 --> 00:11:55,104
Your family knows that it is important
For example, to lead the group

138
00:11:55,229 --> 00:11:59,900
dealing imprint tion
of the yearbook, and...

139
00:12:00,025 --> 00:12:01,986
Shasta!

140
00:12:03,863 --> 00:12:06,198
Listen.

141
00:12:11,286 --> 00:12:15,958
I will review your case
before translocation.

142
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:23,507
Why?
- So we know that it is good enough.

143
00:12:23,633 --> 00:12:27,551
And if it does not it?
- That we do not think so now.

144
00:12:27,676 --> 00:12:29,429
Well not...

145
00:12:30,554 --> 00:12:34,392
We have experienced much, sweetheart.

146
00:12:34,518 --> 00:12:38,396
Who's your daddy?
Exactly.

147
00:12:38,521 --> 00:12:44,276
Why is it called a bra? It looks like
a g-string. How did it go?

148
00:12:44,402 --> 00:12:49,657
Do not ask. Many memories came back
although they have torn the building down.

149
00:12:49,783 --> 00:12:56,580
I told you. You got away last.
It makes you maybe not this time.

150
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:02,211
I'm just trying
to process my memories.

151
00:13:02,336 --> 00:13:07,132
The place spoil people's lives!

152
00:13:08,216 --> 00:13:11,846
I know.
- Big Girl believes what she says!

153
00:13:11,971 --> 00:13:16,724
Can you see the kimono?
It is right. Listen to the kimono.

154
00:13:16,849 --> 00:13:20,438
You need to manipulate...
What does it really mean?

155
00:13:20,563 --> 00:13:24,482
Give me your feelings on toast,
I'll work on them.

156
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:28,361
I told you. Memories...

157
00:13:31,489 --> 00:13:37,037
Want something to drink?
- No thanks.

158
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:48,047
How was school?
- Well, you know...

159
00:13:52,468 --> 00:13:57,056
I do not know
what might encourage the young.

160
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:00,935
Let me see...
I flip through my yearbook.

161
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:06,773
Well, the yearbook. Who helped?
- Yes...

162
00:14:09,902 --> 00:14:12,613
Scarlet. "Thanks... "

163
00:14:12,739 --> 00:14:15,491
"... Because you're so sweet. "

164
00:14:16,782 --> 00:14:18,494
What?

165
00:14:18,619 --> 00:14:22,956
"Ring in the summer.
Scarlet Smith. "

166
00:14:23,081 --> 00:14:26,334
Scarlet Smith?

167
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:31,423
"I'm so in love that I do not know
what to do. "The Scarlet?

168
00:14:31,548 --> 00:14:34,676
Are you ready?

169
00:14:34,801 --> 00:14:37,637
Call her.

170
00:14:37,763 --> 00:14:41,474
No. It is 19 summers ago.

171
00:14:41,599 --> 00:14:47,187
Say that time ran from you.
Think.

172
00:14:47,313 --> 00:14:52,234
Okay.
- Yes! Good boy. Really.

173
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:56,906
What is her phone number?
- She is gorgeous. It's here.

174
00:14:58,365 --> 00:15:01,576
Are you ready? 869th..

175
00:15:04,164 --> 00:15:08,708
Should I take it, mother?
I will not talk to Brad.

176
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:13,338
Is this all?
- Hello?

177
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:17,426
Yes...

178
00:15:19,219 --> 00:15:22,221
Hello?
- But...

179
00:15:22,346 --> 00:15:25,517
Why did you do it?
- I should not call her.

180
00:15:25,642 --> 00:15:30,939
No, you must not call her.
- I'm calling you.

181
00:15:31,064 --> 00:15:34,568
I'll call themselves.
- How should it be.

182
00:15:34,693 --> 00:15:39,030
You were just a little tense.
- What's the number?

183
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:42,451
I'll take it.

184
00:15:44,953 --> 00:15:47,288
It's over, its fun!

185
00:15:48,957 --> 00:15:52,710
That's your problem!
Was I too hard?

186
00:15:52,835 --> 00:15:55,547
Is... Scarlet on?

187
00:15:55,672 --> 00:15:57,506
Who is it?

188
00:15:57,631 --> 00:16:01,803
It is Henry McCanthy.
Who are you?

189
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:06,390
I've been
her best friend for 30 years. Darcy.

190
00:16:06,515 --> 00:16:10,436
Henry McCanthy?
From school...

191
00:16:10,561 --> 00:16:14,648
I was sifting
through the school yearbook -

192
00:16:14,774 --> 00:16:20,446
and she had written: "You're cute.
Ring in the summer. "

193
00:16:20,571 --> 00:16:24,617
She wrote it with an exclamation point,
screaming.

194
00:16:24,741 --> 00:16:27,494
She can not remember you.

195
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:30,998
She... She can not remember it.

196
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:37,004
Just a moment.
If you look on page twelve and...

197
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:41,173
We must look for.
Find yearbook.

198
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:47,680
On page 132 is
a pretty good picture of me.

199
00:16:47,805 --> 00:16:52,059
Great... Look here,
she has not right now.

200
00:16:52,184 --> 00:16:56,063
She can not find it.
- She's not on the nightstand...

201
00:16:56,189 --> 00:17:00,191
...Beside tandbøjlen
and enjørning-poster.

202
00:17:00,316 --> 00:17:03,444
Would you say
Henry McCanthy called?

203
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:07,741
I hang up now.
Thank you for calling.

204
00:17:07,866 --> 00:17:09,951
Okay. Hello.

205
00:17:11,703 --> 00:17:14,999
Who is it?
- He is in love with you.

206
00:17:15,917 --> 00:17:20,671
I am weak.
- Yes.

207
00:17:20,796 --> 00:17:22,422
How bummer.

208
00:17:23,924 --> 00:17:28,886
What did you do?
- We called Scarlet Smith.

209
00:17:29,012 --> 00:17:33,474
That's right.
- I can not eat... Jo.

210
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,851
Yes.

211
00:17:35,976 --> 00:17:40,856
Will not you forget it?
And you will not help him.

212
00:17:40,982 --> 00:17:44,486
He has nothing to lose.
- Or win.

213
00:17:44,611 --> 00:17:49,991
I just wanted to hear what she is doing.
- I guess it was mutual?

214
00:17:50,116 --> 00:17:54,786
Forget it, forget it.
Forget it.

215
00:17:54,911 --> 00:17:57,997
I'm proud.
- Self-destructive...

216
00:17:58,123 --> 00:18:01,418
She saw me as a nerd.

217
00:18:01,543 --> 00:18:05,797
What a force!
- It's the first thing I agree with:

218
00:18:05,922 --> 00:18:10,802
"So," you as a nerd?
You're still a geek.

219
00:18:10,927 --> 00:18:15,682
Forget it. Forget it.
You do not need that kind.

220
00:18:15,808 --> 00:18:20,020
Are you with me? Your heart would
have increased by smoking crack.

221
00:18:20,144 --> 00:18:25,484
She did not look at the picture to remember
why she can not remember me.

222
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:28,737
Great!
Now you are thinking positively.

223
00:18:29,945 --> 00:18:35,159
I found your yearbook!
And those here, thanks.

224
00:18:35,284 --> 00:18:39,248
Here it is.

225
00:18:40,623 --> 00:18:44,919
Have you found him?
Was he nice?

226
00:18:45,044 --> 00:18:49,883
We had chemistry.
Yes, we had chemistry hours together.

227
00:18:50,008 --> 00:18:56,054
He was so sweet. Always helpful.
- He used that you were stupid.

228
00:18:56,180 --> 00:19:01,227
Now I get a bad conscience.
- Why would you remember him?

229
00:19:01,352 --> 00:19:04,772
He looks old-fashioned.
Like my father.

230
00:19:04,898 --> 00:19:10,361
Would you call him?
- He seems enough, I am part.

231
00:19:10,486 --> 00:19:15,240
So are you. What happens
if I take this one?

232
00:19:15,365 --> 00:19:16,950
Anal Leakage.

233
00:19:22,204 --> 00:19:25,166
Truant you already?

234
00:19:26,501 --> 00:19:29,754
Shasta O'Neill
one of school leavers.

235
00:19:29,879 --> 00:19:32,006
Shasta.

236
00:19:33,174 --> 00:19:37,344
You came not to hours.
- I had not done her homework.

237
00:19:37,469 --> 00:19:40,347
It is not good.

238
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:46,228
I thought that I could get
more about the students here.

239
00:19:46,354 --> 00:19:49,106
As far as I can see -

240
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:54,861
the library is still a sanctuary
for the socially handicapped.

241
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:59,033
- Exercise...
- Down on the floor.

242
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:05,747
Ned.
- The outlets are closed.

243
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:12,046
Should we not go out by fire alarm?
- This is an emergency alarm.

244
00:20:12,171 --> 00:20:15,673
There is perhaps one of Firearms
on school property.

245
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:21,597
Relax. Nobody has guns.
It's just an exercise.

246
00:20:21,722 --> 00:20:25,016
Jaså?
How often do I practice on this?

247
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:29,604
A couple times a week.
- Well. Great.

248
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:44,244
Hello?
- Ringer I too late? This is Scarlet.

249
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:47,788
Yes, Scarlet.
- You called me.

250
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,414
Hello?

251
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:53,086
It's me, Dad.
- It's pretty late...

252
00:20:53,211 --> 00:20:55,838
The one girl's father.

253
00:20:55,963 --> 00:21:02,469
Hello. How are you?
- My life is a little turbulent right now.

254
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:06,682
I'm moving
and stuff.

255
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:11,812
It's nice to hear from you.
- I live temporarily with my mother.

256
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:15,399
So I must also tackle.

257
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:19,528
Henry McCanthy. How are you?
- Fine.

258
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:22,238
How are you?

259
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:28,662
"I saw her, Lauren Landers
and there was something weird. "

260
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:35,293
"We had attended the same school,
but now she was a woman. "

261
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:40,214
"From the moment
She was constantly in my thoughts. "

262
00:21:40,339 --> 00:21:46,178
"One day Lauren bumped into me at
time. I felt the ten elbow. "

263
00:21:46,304 --> 00:21:47,931
"Like a lightning strike. "

264
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:51,642
Tomorrow night
at half past eight?

265
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:54,812
Yes. That sounds good.

266
00:21:54,937 --> 00:21:56,647
Perfect.

267
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:04,155
"She left and I stood back
like an idiot and muttered: "Laurer"

268
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:07,283
"'Is this how
love feels? "'

269
00:22:24,757 --> 00:22:28,971
Hello?
- Wake up. It is Javier.

270
00:22:29,096 --> 00:22:32,724
Just a moment.
The connection is bad. Wait.

271
00:22:32,849 --> 00:22:37,937
I have some news.
Is everything okay, Henry?

272
00:22:38,062 --> 00:22:42,734
A big film company will have
a little right for your book.

273
00:22:42,859 --> 00:22:48,490
- It is certainly not small...
- They'll change the title of "Lionel".

274
00:22:48,615 --> 00:22:54,411
- What do they want instead?
- Something modern as Linkin Park.

275
00:22:54,536 --> 00:23:01,085
- Linkin Park? There is no sex.
- Women, 15-25 years, liked them.

276
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:04,296
Men of 15-35 years
warmest positive.

277
00:23:04,421 --> 00:23:06,298
Hello? Henry?

278
00:23:06,423 --> 00:23:12,471
Remember when I said that the title
"Late developed" was not good.

279
00:23:12,596 --> 00:23:18,144
- Linkin Park do not give a sex.
- Oh yes. Well, we agree.

280
00:23:30,864 --> 00:23:34,575
If you're sweet on Desirée -

281
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:39,164
she's sweet on you.
She likes...

282
00:23:40,373 --> 00:23:43,543
...A firm hand sometimes.

283
00:23:44,627 --> 00:23:51,050
- I drive only when you think.
- She should be out among people.

284
00:23:51,175 --> 00:23:56,556
Damn...
I can just rent a car?

285
00:23:56,681 --> 00:24:00,392
No, no. You must not do.

286
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,066
Oh no.
She gives me already a rash.

287
00:24:09,901 --> 00:24:12,237
Let us see.

288
00:24:12,363 --> 00:24:16,574
God.
Is this your parasitic twin?

289
00:24:16,699 --> 00:24:20,370
- Ladies!
- I'm not a tourist attraction.

290
00:24:20,495 --> 00:24:22,247
See.

291
00:24:24,916 --> 00:24:26,751
Okay, ladies...

292
00:24:26,876 --> 00:24:32,381
A cold compress, herbal tea,
light foundation and a donut.

293
00:24:33,383 --> 00:24:37,471
- Doughnut?
- Yes, it is to me.

294
00:24:37,596 --> 00:24:42,308
- What will you do about it?
- Not much.

295
00:24:42,433 --> 00:24:48,022
We can attack, but the syvdageskrig
all to notice.

296
00:24:49,899 --> 00:24:52,275
It's Scarlet-stress.

297
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:57,073
- What can I do?
- Relax. Do you like whale song?

298
00:25:00,117 --> 00:25:02,620
Come with
cold compress!

299
00:25:02,745 --> 00:25:07,707
"The last year I was luckily
next to Lauren in chemistry lessons. "

300
00:25:07,832 --> 00:25:13,005
"But I asked only whether she would
need help to dissect the frog. "

301
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:16,675
- Henry?
- Hello, Scarlet.

302
00:25:18,676 --> 00:25:22,640
- This seems odd, no?
- Oh no.

303
00:25:22,765 --> 00:25:27,978
I just think all the time
Henry from school.

304
00:25:28,103 --> 00:25:32,732
In a teenager.
I just need to get used to it.

305
00:25:34,484 --> 00:25:38,488
- Is that so bad?
- No, no.

306
00:25:38,613 --> 00:25:41,867
But the Henryvar...

307
00:25:41,992 --> 00:25:46,662
But now you're a grown man
with a beard and a beer.

308
00:25:46,787 --> 00:25:50,457
Yes, it's just happened...

309
00:25:50,583 --> 00:25:54,837
But you have not changed you.

310
00:25:54,962 --> 00:25:59,758
- Is it positive or negative?
- You are incredible sex.

311
00:25:59,883 --> 00:26:03,136
It was embarrassing, no?

312
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:08,767
I'm pharmacies. It is depressing
supplying antidepressants.

313
00:26:08,892 --> 00:26:14,649
You can also call me
a drug dealer in a small town.

314
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:21,821
- I'm not in my niche.
- It's none of us.

315
00:26:21,946 --> 00:26:26,577
You must have accomplish something
when you need to keep talking.

316
00:26:26,702 --> 00:26:30,788
- Well, I've written some books.
- Are you a writer?

317
00:26:30,914 --> 00:26:33,999
Yes, if someone else read them.

318
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:39,464
You probably have many fans
who read them. I also want.

319
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:43,883
- Where can I find a book?
- I'll get to you.

320
00:26:44,009 --> 00:26:48,180
No, I will buy it
for my own money.

321
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:53,228
- It is available in bookstores.
- Okay.

322
00:26:53,352 --> 00:26:58,858
- It was nice to see you.
- It was also nice to see you.

323
00:26:58,983 --> 00:27:01,652
- Bye.
- Bye.

324
00:27:03,946 --> 00:27:05,991
What is the book?

325
00:27:06,115 --> 00:27:09,659
"How Lionel gave me sex. "

326
00:27:09,784 --> 00:27:11,996
Just a moment.

327
00:27:12,121 --> 00:27:15,583
- Who is Lionel?
- Richie.

328
00:27:15,707 --> 00:27:20,587
With "Dancing On The Ceiling"?
Lionel Richie gave him sex?

329
00:27:20,712 --> 00:27:24,633
Maybe.
I have read about it.

330
00:27:24,758 --> 00:27:30,346
The book is on shelf E. The books are
alphabetically by author.

331
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:36,353
Okay, what happened?
You smile as if he were delicious...

332
00:27:36,478 --> 00:27:40,439
- ... Or you are embarrassed Daten.
- It was not a date.

333
00:27:40,564 --> 00:27:44,153
I promise not to tease you.
He was fat and bald?

334
00:27:44,278 --> 00:27:47,572
- No...
- Jeans?

335
00:27:47,697 --> 00:27:52,451
Was he a divorced dad
with lots of children?

336
00:27:52,576 --> 00:27:57,622
It must have been pretty good
when you bet on the relationship.

337
00:27:57,747 --> 00:28:03,045
You buy his book. I would never
read unite husband's sake.

338
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:06,925
Here it is.
Bingo! Photo by the author...

339
00:28:07,049 --> 00:28:10,260
- Let's see how he looks.
- Is it important?

340
00:28:10,385 --> 00:28:14,181
Yes, that's it.
Will you destroy your genes?

341
00:28:14,306 --> 00:28:19,186
I gambled on the appearance,
and now I live with my mom.

342
00:28:19,311 --> 00:28:23,981
- Wait. Is it him?
- Yes.

343
00:28:24,106 --> 00:28:26,568
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

344
00:28:27,735 --> 00:28:31,698
- He is actually quite delicious.
- I know.

345
00:28:32,823 --> 00:28:36,453
What other geeks
was delicious after school hours?

346
00:28:45,253 --> 00:28:49,882
You are so pretty with your blonde hair.
Oh, you're so pretty.

347
00:28:50,007 --> 00:28:56,388
Why is not bold Scarlet
and five obese children?

348
00:28:56,513 --> 00:29:01,353
Then the case would be settled.
Why is it not?

349
00:29:01,478 --> 00:29:06,941
- Because the world peace depends on it.
- I pretend that I understand it.

350
00:29:08,985 --> 00:29:11,987
Beautiful. It lasted good choice.

351
00:29:14,781 --> 00:29:19,871
- Henry. Hello!
- Hi, Shasta. How are you?

352
00:29:19,996 --> 00:29:23,998
Good morning, Mr. McCanthy.
May I see the speech?

353
00:29:24,123 --> 00:29:27,085
I am still working on it.

354
00:29:27,209 --> 00:29:30,546
- Is this a problem?
- Yes, I guess.

355
00:29:30,671 --> 00:29:35,260
As I've said, we must
have enough time to read the speech.

356
00:29:35,385 --> 00:29:38,972
If we have not read the speech,
you probably do not hold it.

357
00:29:39,097 --> 00:29:43,683
- When we see something?
- As soon as I see something.

358
00:30:09,334 --> 00:30:13,922
- Hello.
- Hello, Scarlet. What are you doing?

359
00:30:14,047 --> 00:30:17,009
I just want to see
what you do.

360
00:30:17,134 --> 00:30:21,138
I try
To get started with the speech.

361
00:30:21,263 --> 00:30:24,474
Jaså. How are you?

362
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:27,060
It is not at all.

363
00:30:27,185 --> 00:30:32,190
- How about a little distraction?
- I could well use.

364
00:30:33,317 --> 00:30:36,570
- Meet me in front of the house.
- Okay.

365
00:30:38,404 --> 00:30:42,616
I want to know who Lionel is.
Hello!

366
00:30:42,742 --> 00:30:46,620
- You have school tomorrow...
- I come home late!

367
00:30:49,415 --> 00:30:54,795
Cheers to Mrs. Looch,
still picks on me.

368
00:30:56,714 --> 00:31:00,092
Why does Mrs. Leuchtenberg
called Mrs. Looch?

369
00:31:00,217 --> 00:31:03,554
- Say the name.
- Lutchenberger.

370
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:09,227
Leuchtenberg.
As in Leuch-tenberger.

371
00:31:09,352 --> 00:31:12,104
Luh... Leuchen...

372
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:17,943
- Do you understand now?
- Yes. Why you got me for that?

373
00:31:18,068 --> 00:31:20,528
That's why
she called it.

374
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:26,075
- She still wish that I fail.
- Forget it.

375
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:32,498
Those who can, do.
The others turned to Mrs. Looch.

376
00:31:33,666 --> 00:31:37,587
- Think you can run?
- Yes.

377
00:31:37,712 --> 00:31:40,507
I do not want
a spritdom.

378
00:31:52,602 --> 00:31:56,981
- The car has many lights.
- It's Brad.

379
00:31:57,106 --> 00:32:00,735
- Your Brad?
- My ex Brad.

380
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:07,158
- Does he know that he is your "ex"?
- He hears only what he wants to hear.

381
00:32:07,283 --> 00:32:13,414
- Can you run from him? Do it.
- Will he beat me?

382
00:32:13,539 --> 00:32:19,252
Yes, if he will not chitchat
about the good old days at school.

383
00:32:20,503 --> 00:32:24,925
Turn here.

384
00:32:28,053 --> 00:32:30,847
If we got rid of him?

385
00:32:33,016 --> 00:32:38,980
Stop there! Keep your hands where I
can see them. Stig quietly out of the car.

386
00:32:40,105 --> 00:32:44,903
Put your hands on your head.
Stand with feet apart.

387
00:32:45,028 --> 00:32:48,739
- You drove a bit fast, huh?
- Yes. Sorry.

388
00:32:48,864 --> 00:32:52,868
Do you know how strong
one must drive near a school?

389
00:32:52,993 --> 00:32:55,662
40 kmh.

390
00:32:55,788 --> 00:32:59,249
- Have you been drinking? Are you sure?
- Yes.

391
00:32:59,374 --> 00:33:02,002
A New York City, of course.

392
00:33:02,126 --> 00:33:03,879
DRIVING

393
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:09,051
- What the hell... McCanthy!
- Bird!

394
00:33:09,176 --> 00:33:11,886
Nice to meet you, Bird.

395
00:33:12,011 --> 00:33:15,432
Can not you recognize me
under police equipment?

396
00:33:15,557 --> 00:33:20,229
- I've lost me a bit.
- Very.

397
00:33:20,354 --> 00:33:24,441
I had surgery,
and now it's over with pizzas.

398
00:33:24,565 --> 00:33:28,361
I was about to shoot you.
It was close.

399
00:33:28,487 --> 00:33:30,823
Who is it?

400
00:33:31,948 --> 00:33:36,911
- Hello! Is not Scarlet Smith?
- Jo.

401
00:33:37,036 --> 00:33:39,789
Well then.

402
00:33:39,914 --> 00:33:44,210
- Sitting Scarlet Smith in your car?
- Yes...

403
00:33:44,335 --> 00:33:48,172
- Is she not with Brad?
- They have turned up.

404
00:33:48,297 --> 00:33:53,219
- I do not gossip. Growers in sex?
- No, we just chat.

405
00:33:53,344 --> 00:33:58,349
I'd rather not know...
320 here. Duty calls.

406
00:33:58,474 --> 00:34:01,477
Run a little slower.
It was nice to see you.

407
00:34:01,602 --> 00:34:05,523
- You look great.
- Be careful...

408
00:34:05,648 --> 00:34:10,027
...And worth considering if you want to borrow
handcuffs. Have a good evening!

409
00:34:14,657 --> 00:34:20,829
Sorry. I should have
told us about Brad. He looks like himself.

410
00:34:20,954 --> 00:34:23,706
I had figured out.

411
00:34:23,831 --> 00:34:30,338
Yes, he has not accepted
that our relationship is over.

412
00:34:30,463 --> 00:34:33,508
It does nothing.

413
00:34:37,094 --> 00:34:42,183
- You can run.
- Yes. Good night.

414
00:34:42,308 --> 00:34:44,352
I'll call you.

415
00:34:46,062 --> 00:34:49,649
Here, Coach! I am free!

416
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:55,112
It was your ball
but you stand and nail you!

417
00:34:57,281 --> 00:35:00,618
You and I should have a chat.
About Scarlet.

418
00:35:00,742 --> 00:35:04,621
- It has not happened.
- No. And that makes it...

419
00:35:04,746 --> 00:35:08,709
- ... There will be problems.
- The coach will be a bitch.

420
00:35:08,835 --> 00:35:12,213
I prefer me not.

421
00:35:12,338 --> 00:35:16,467
- Into my office.
- The coach is in trouble!

422
00:35:24,474 --> 00:35:27,352
What is the problem, guys?

423
00:35:31,231 --> 00:35:34,900
We can sit here all day
if I feel like it.

424
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:43,450
Now you will hear:
The problem must be solved -

425
00:35:43,575 --> 00:35:47,788
Today, this office before you go.
Is that understood?

426
00:35:49,999 --> 00:35:52,752
We'll start with you.

427
00:35:54,044 --> 00:35:58,840
Sorry, but I was doing
with training...

428
00:35:58,966 --> 00:36:02,927
- ... Because narrøven provoked me.
- "Narrøven"?

429
00:36:03,053 --> 00:36:07,642
Can we stick to the matter?
I walk in the hallway...

430
00:36:07,767 --> 00:36:13,021
- He walks in the hallway without permission.
- I need no permission.

431
00:36:13,147 --> 00:36:16,274
I walk in the hallway
quietly...

432
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:22,156
He interrupts my training. I would
just win the state championship.

433
00:36:22,281 --> 00:36:24,698
That was below the belt.

434
00:36:27,786 --> 00:36:31,289
You have some problems, Henry.

435
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:35,835
You should stick to writing.

436
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,505
And silent.

437
00:36:42,008 --> 00:36:45,929
I think
I can understand Brad's frustration.

438
00:36:46,054 --> 00:36:52,561
He is surrounded by delicious
teenage boys, half naked, young...

439
00:36:52,686 --> 00:36:56,105
- The kind of eats away at everyone.
- Yes.

440
00:36:56,229 --> 00:37:01,360
He gives losers a bad name.
- Yes, he does.

441
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:04,697
- What would you do?
- He will stay away.

442
00:37:04,822 --> 00:37:09,284
- Some people never evolve.
- You can beat him.

443
00:37:09,409 --> 00:37:14,915
Behave not like a young bull.
Brad break your neck.

444
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:19,670
Sometimes you have to be satisfied
with what you have.

445
00:37:19,795 --> 00:37:24,466
Geek do not get the girl.
Bill, thanks!

446
00:38:01,043 --> 00:38:05,506
I have a little message for you.

447
00:38:05,631 --> 00:38:10,886
For older students,
to be involved in school dance:

448
00:38:11,011 --> 00:38:14,140
Use your common sense -

449
00:38:14,265 --> 00:38:17,893
so it is not
your last dance.

450
00:38:18,018 --> 00:38:20,979
And one more thing:

451
00:38:21,104 --> 00:38:23,106
Heja, Wildcats!

452
00:38:28,695 --> 00:38:35,910
"I asked Lauren to be my date
writing. I dared not speak. "

453
00:38:36,036 --> 00:38:41,750
"I put a note in her
kemibog. She never answered. "

454
00:38:41,875 --> 00:38:47,130
"I started counting the days
and hours for translocation. "

455
00:38:47,255 --> 00:38:50,007
"I waited
to be liberated. "

456
00:38:50,133 --> 00:38:53,218
- Hello!
- Oh god...

457
00:38:54,178 --> 00:38:56,806
Hey...

458
00:38:56,931 --> 00:39:00,184
Is everything okay, Shasta?

459
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:04,021
- Is everything okay?
- Sure.

460
00:39:04,146 --> 00:39:07,232
I'm so stupid.
I need to get a hug.

461
00:39:07,357 --> 00:39:10,735
My girlfriend just
broke up with me.

462
00:39:12,904 --> 00:39:14,948
How inappropriate...

463
00:39:16,826 --> 00:39:19,620
Are you okay now?

464
00:39:19,745 --> 00:39:24,498
Will not you tell me
your afslutningsbal was boring.

465
00:39:24,623 --> 00:39:28,252
- I was not.
- What? Why not?

466
00:39:29,546 --> 00:39:33,507
For stupid reasons.

467
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:38,388
- You need some for a hug.
- No, I'm fine.

468
00:39:38,513 --> 00:39:43,935
A good hug can redeem
several years of pent-up pain.

469
00:39:45,854 --> 00:39:51,609
A good hug can get me cooped up
for 20 painful years.

470
00:39:51,734 --> 00:39:55,238
It does nothing.
Feel better now? Then we go.

471
00:39:55,363 --> 00:39:58,449
Okay. Thank you.

472
00:39:58,574 --> 00:40:03,704
- You'll handle it.
- Thank you cheered me up.

473
00:40:05,205 --> 00:40:09,542
May I ask
some questions first?

474
00:40:09,667 --> 00:40:13,463
Is it true
you fought with the coach?

475
00:40:13,588 --> 00:40:17,175
Refuse you?
We have witnesses.

476
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:24,640
- Would you comment on the episode?
- Not really.

477
00:40:24,766 --> 00:40:30,523
Are the rumors true Shasta?
I should have embraced each other.

478
00:40:30,648 --> 00:40:33,650
"Embraced"?
It lasted stuff.

479
00:40:33,776 --> 00:40:37,819
A hug goods 3.2 seconds.
Your train 20th

480
00:40:37,944 --> 00:40:41,699
- It was an embrace.
- She was upset.

481
00:40:41,824 --> 00:40:45,369
- Are you coming along or not?
- No.

482
00:40:45,494 --> 00:40:49,081
You angrily inequality
to influence our conclusions.

483
00:40:49,999 --> 00:40:52,960
We promise to quote you verbatim.

484
00:40:53,085 --> 00:40:58,424
- Have you ever read the book?
- The text on the cover is good.

485
00:40:58,549 --> 00:41:01,135
I like the title.

486
00:41:05,221 --> 00:41:10,894
Beautiful as always.
Looking at it. How sweet.

487
00:41:11,019 --> 00:41:15,191
How fine?
Bridal veil is classical.

488
00:41:15,316 --> 00:41:21,571
- Yes, Brad is a real charmer.
- He is jealous, have called 20 times.

489
00:41:21,697 --> 00:41:24,657
It was not my intention.

490
00:41:24,783 --> 00:41:29,454
- What did you think Brad would do?
- This.

491
00:41:30,622 --> 00:41:37,378
I mean... He should not decide
what I need and how I live...

492
00:41:37,503 --> 00:41:43,217
- ... Or whoever I see.
- Now you can demand change.

493
00:41:43,342 --> 00:41:46,471
Brad does not change underwear.

494
00:41:46,596 --> 00:41:50,141
Brad only think about Brad.
It's over.

495
00:41:50,266 --> 00:41:53,143
It you have
to accept.

496
00:41:53,268 --> 00:41:57,482
- Oh god, you love the guy.
- Yes.

497
00:41:57,607 --> 00:42:02,236
- You absolutely love him, right?
- Yes.

498
00:42:03,028 --> 00:42:06,866
Remember what happened
with the last guy you were crazy.

499
00:42:06,991 --> 00:42:08,909
A glass eye.

500
00:42:11,703 --> 00:42:15,039
Someone will come after us.

501
00:42:15,165 --> 00:42:17,751
It is not him.

502
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:47,030
- Hello!
- Stop it there.

503
00:42:47,155 --> 00:42:50,533
- Do not I be worried?
- Yes, but you are scary.

504
00:42:50,658 --> 00:42:55,663
- You need proliferate protection.
- I'm with. Thanks, but...

505
00:42:55,788 --> 00:43:00,459
- Is it Scarlet? May I say hello?
- Be there.

506
00:43:03,462 --> 00:43:08,884
- How are you?
- Fine.

507
00:43:09,009 --> 00:43:13,972
Between us girls, "kisses you it
are you in pieces. "

508
00:43:15,557 --> 00:43:19,853
Enjoy.
Start the engine!

509
00:43:24,356 --> 00:43:27,235
You are so strong.
It is here you are doing.

510
00:43:36,244 --> 00:43:38,538
You're so quiet.

511
00:43:39,872 --> 00:43:45,878
- I've always been quiet.
- You're a cheerleader girl.

512
00:43:48,297 --> 00:43:51,425
Sorry. I just sat...

513
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:54,094
...And remembering back, I thought.

514
00:43:55,137 --> 00:44:00,601
- Jaså. Are not you glad?
- I'm not sad.

515
00:44:00,726 --> 00:44:05,939
I see so many
depressed people everyday.

516
00:44:06,064 --> 00:44:10,944
You would be shocked
where many city residents -

517
00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:14,448
taking medication
against something.

518
00:44:14,573 --> 00:44:19,453
It is difficult
to address the sad lives.

519
00:44:19,578 --> 00:44:24,959
I have probably taken all the bad
decisions can be taken.

520
00:44:25,084 --> 00:44:30,964
We do not stop it. You make
Once one that affects your life.

521
00:44:31,089 --> 00:44:36,887
When one realizes that the decisions
affect, they must mean something.

522
00:44:43,142 --> 00:44:47,897
- It was a decision.
- A good or bad decision?

523
00:44:48,022 --> 00:44:51,816
- What do you think?
- A good decision.

524
00:44:51,942 --> 00:44:54,027
Very.

525
00:45:00,410 --> 00:45:03,079
Was "Kissing Mountain" is not here?

526
00:45:05,455 --> 00:45:09,418
I do not know.
I've never been here.

527
00:45:09,543 --> 00:45:13,504
- Of course you know.
- Trollop is revealed.

528
00:45:13,629 --> 00:45:17,217
- I've never been here.
- Stop it.

529
00:45:17,342 --> 00:45:23,264
You have not been here long.
It is a residential neighborhood now.

530
00:45:23,389 --> 00:45:25,684
But it is here.

531
00:45:25,809 --> 00:45:31,898
It happens when you kiss too long.
We do not know where you are.

532
00:45:34,108 --> 00:45:38,029
- What are you doing?
- We must find a better view.

533
00:45:41,866 --> 00:45:47,831
We must see what is
behind fremvisningshus number four.

534
00:45:50,416 --> 00:45:52,543
Come on.

535
00:45:55,629 --> 00:45:58,966
Close the door. Come, come, come.

536
00:46:00,927 --> 00:46:03,054
Gently.

537
00:46:03,179 --> 00:46:06,349
What a great TV. Come on.

538
00:46:09,643 --> 00:46:14,065
- What do you say? Nice view, huh?
- Not bad.

539
00:46:16,233 --> 00:46:21,112
- You invited me to the prom?
- Yes.

540
00:46:22,447 --> 00:46:27,702
You did not answer.
But it's okay. It does nothing.

541
00:46:38,713 --> 00:46:43,467
- I wish I had answered that way.
- Good answer.

542
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:51,809
What triggers this?

543
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:56,187
We're here.
Put your address in.

544
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:04,029
Brandon.

545
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:10,035
Oh god...

546
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,496
I can not ignore him.

547
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:36,436
- Let me talk to him.
- I'll do it.

548
00:47:36,561 --> 00:47:42,942
- Scarlet. I talk to him.
- Go into the car again, Henry.

549
00:47:45,945 --> 00:47:51,616
You are too much.
I have nothing to say to you.

550
00:47:58,624 --> 00:48:02,795
- Linda here. Are you hurt?
- I'm fine.

551
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:06,382
Have you been out unite accident
or are you lost?

552
00:48:06,506 --> 00:48:08,426
Very.

553
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:20,103
"Lauren changed places
in chemistry lessons. "

554
00:48:21,187 --> 00:48:24,775
"It was as if I
had ceased to exist. "

555
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:31,531
"I was not in her field of vision
and disappeared like a worm in acid. "

556
00:48:36,244 --> 00:48:42,625
"I biked past Lauren and hoped
she realized how good I was. "

557
00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:46,044
"How cool
and interesting I was. "

558
00:48:46,169 --> 00:48:49,132
"Lauren filled
my waking hours. "

559
00:48:49,257 --> 00:48:55,304
"She continued to ignore me
and the day was an eternal torment. "

560
00:49:01,101 --> 00:49:04,187
"I had fortunately
my friends. "

561
00:49:04,312 --> 00:49:11,319
"Bryan and Wayne pulled me always
out of my self-pity. "

562
00:49:11,444 --> 00:49:18,701
"I did not show my gratitude.
They made me forget Lauren. "

563
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:28,503
"They knew what could
cure my depression: Laughter. "

564
00:49:28,628 --> 00:49:34,216
"Wayne got a tattooed cow with
a cigar to get me to laugh. "

565
00:49:36,552 --> 00:49:39,264
Games

566
00:49:41,808 --> 00:49:43,893
Look sharp.

567
00:49:49,231 --> 00:49:53,110
- What did she say?
- Do it now, not worse, than it is.

568
00:49:53,235 --> 00:49:56,405
We did not come together.

569
00:49:57,490 --> 00:50:03,329
I ate, I drove into your car,
theoretically is to come together.

570
00:50:03,454 --> 00:50:07,458
Did you at least a memory?
Panties?

571
00:50:07,583 --> 00:50:13,589
- I beat you soon.
- The rest of us will also have fun.

572
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:21,345
She can not relax.
- It took time, but you gave you do not.

573
00:50:22,013 --> 00:50:24,348
Well done.

574
00:50:25,934 --> 00:50:29,229
You are my hero.
Come on.

575
00:50:30,564 --> 00:50:33,484
I must beat a stroke.

576
00:50:33,609 --> 00:50:36,569
History repeats itself.

577
00:50:36,695 --> 00:50:43,784
Everything is as when school was over.
20 years is gone.

578
00:50:44,785 --> 00:50:47,246
You know what?

579
00:50:47,371 --> 00:50:51,583
You have recovered
over Scarlet fever before.

580
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:56,339
We were 18 years then.
Much younger.

581
00:50:56,463 --> 00:51:00,050
My genes means
I never get the girl.

582
00:51:00,175 --> 00:51:03,053
I know how it is.

583
00:51:03,178 --> 00:51:06,681
- Come here.
- Yes. Well...

584
00:51:06,806 --> 00:51:11,520
- I'm with. You want a hug.
- Yes. Smells you by Old Spice?

585
00:51:11,646 --> 00:51:16,441
It's your problem.
You get something else.

586
00:51:17,567 --> 00:51:22,614
We combine it all
and the Mount wonderful celebration.

587
00:51:22,739 --> 00:51:26,159
Who envelopes
with the finished project?

588
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:30,330
Is everyone ready soon
with their projects?

589
00:51:30,455 --> 00:51:33,625
- Fine. I...
- Sorry, Mrs. Leuchtenberg.

590
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:38,379
- Do I disturb for a moment?
- Deliver the speech, if it is finished.

591
00:51:38,504 --> 00:51:43,133
Otherwise, you must get
until after hours.

592
00:51:43,259 --> 00:51:48,847
Time is short.
Finish your projects -

593
00:51:48,973 --> 00:51:52,185
and dispose of them so I can
cross them off the list.

594
00:51:52,310 --> 00:51:57,648
We put the finishing touches on everything.
It will be a fine event.

595
00:51:57,773 --> 00:52:00,693
We must be ready...

596
00:52:04,154 --> 00:52:07,865
- I'll take that.
- Of course you did.

597
00:52:09,201 --> 00:52:13,914
You must choose.
Should I read it otherwise it mite look like?

598
00:52:22,047 --> 00:52:26,134
It depends on
what it says.

599
00:52:27,885 --> 00:52:32,223
I must say
that your behavior disappoints me.

600
00:52:32,349 --> 00:52:36,560
You are involved
in many episodes.

601
00:52:36,686 --> 00:52:41,358
It is the second time you are
the office for disciplinary reasons.

602
00:52:41,483 --> 00:52:44,193
And this here episode...

603
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:48,405
...Are serious.
- She sent a note.

604
00:52:49,656 --> 00:52:52,868
Do you know what is on it?
- No.

605
00:52:54,412 --> 00:52:59,207
- Would you like to know?
- Yes, it was for me.

606
00:53:05,506 --> 00:53:06,715
WILL YOU FOLLOW WITH ME
FOR BALLET SCHOOL?

607
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:10,720
- Amusing.
- Well, you can see the comedy.

608
00:53:13,179 --> 00:53:19,603
I did not mean it here, as I said,
you should teach students to know.

609
00:53:19,728 --> 00:53:22,814
I must not accompany Shasta
to prom?

610
00:53:22,939 --> 00:53:28,194
I can only control what
happens at school, and it is my responsibility.

611
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:33,492
I and the school district
has a zero tolerance policy.

612
00:53:33,616 --> 00:53:37,161
You'll be expelled.

613
00:53:37,286 --> 00:53:41,791
- Am I banned?
- Yes.

614
00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:47,087
Go away.

615
00:53:47,212 --> 00:53:49,882
I will do.

616
00:53:55,721 --> 00:54:02,435
- Hello! All is well right?
- Yes, everything is okay. Do not worry.

617
00:54:02,561 --> 00:54:06,565
I was just turned away.
- God...

618
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:11,070
You must apologize.
- It's okay.

619
00:54:11,195 --> 00:54:17,201
She wanted to do it soon.
Now she has got his wish.

620
00:54:17,326 --> 00:54:21,955
What do you say?
To note, that is.

621
00:54:22,914 --> 00:54:26,918
Well, Leaflet.
It was fun. You're funny.

622
00:54:27,044 --> 00:54:32,256
We can not follow the school dance.
This runs counter to everything...

623
00:54:32,381 --> 00:54:36,219
For example, gravity
who keeps his feet on the ground.

624
00:54:36,344 --> 00:54:40,139
Think of it as research.

625
00:54:40,264 --> 00:54:44,101
Say yes now,
then you can change your mind later.

626
00:54:44,227 --> 00:54:50,316
If you say no now, you may
never able to say yes.

627
00:54:51,233 --> 00:54:55,070
It is very smart,
I like, but never implemented.

628
00:54:55,196 --> 00:55:00,533
There must be many guys
who will accompany you? You are beautiful.

629
00:55:00,659 --> 00:55:05,706
I put actual requirements. Mr. Marshall
banished you not from the ballet.

630
00:55:05,831 --> 00:55:09,710
So make them angry
and came with me.

631
00:55:09,834 --> 00:55:13,588
Will not you?

632
00:55:13,714 --> 00:55:17,175
I am no longer defiant.
I stopped at the door.

633
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:22,473
You are too much. You know that.
You are really too much.

634
00:55:22,597 --> 00:55:27,060
So it is good,
when one is full 37 years.

635
00:55:27,185 --> 00:55:30,147
Oh god...

636
00:55:30,272 --> 00:55:35,443
- What color is your dress?
- Really? Turquoise.

637
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:38,321
Great.

638
00:55:39,696 --> 00:55:43,910
- Why I said yes?
- Now it's done.

639
00:55:44,035 --> 00:55:49,957
Just accept and enjoy the moment.
This is your golden crowbar -

640
00:55:50,082 --> 00:55:53,669
which will free you
from your past.

641
00:55:53,794 --> 00:56:00,051
- Scarlet must not stop you again.
- I remember to cancel the Shasta.

642
00:56:00,176 --> 00:56:05,306
Now I'll explain something.
When you get some success...

643
00:56:05,431 --> 00:56:10,894
...Can a celebrity does not make mistakes.
Doing so, the consequences are small.

644
00:56:11,019 --> 00:56:14,690
Go to bed with your stepdaughter,
team pajama party with young boys...

645
00:56:14,815 --> 00:56:18,526
- I'm not a celebrity.
- Let me explain it to you.

646
00:56:18,651 --> 00:56:24,114
Are you your own master,
are you a celebrity according to the Big Girl.

647
00:56:25,909 --> 00:56:28,995
- My goodness.
- Voila.

648
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:34,083
Arrested me, I will call you.
- You should take with me.

649
00:56:40,924 --> 00:56:44,344
- Wow! Francesca.
- My goodness.

650
00:56:44,469 --> 00:56:46,471
Henry McCanthy.

651
00:56:48,556 --> 00:56:51,016
Yes...

652
00:56:51,141 --> 00:56:55,480
- Shasta has told all about you.
- Okay.

653
00:56:55,604 --> 00:57:00,484
- Yes. Go ahead...
- She is not my...

654
00:57:00,610 --> 00:57:06,365
- Oh no. Come in.
- Thanks.

655
00:57:18,042 --> 00:57:23,214
- What are you working with?
- I write. I'm an author.

656
00:57:23,339 --> 00:57:28,511
- What are you writing?
- It's a good question.

657
00:57:28,636 --> 00:57:31,847
Here she comes,
and she looks fantastic.

658
00:57:33,267 --> 00:57:34,850
Hello.

659
00:57:36,352 --> 00:57:39,856
- What's wrong, father?
- Should you be then?

660
00:57:39,981 --> 00:57:43,234
She's so fine, baby.
What?

661
00:57:44,652 --> 00:57:46,987
Let's go.

662
00:57:47,112 --> 00:57:50,824
- He is still delicious.
- No.

663
00:57:52,243 --> 00:57:53,994
Happy thoughts...

664
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:02,671
- Hello?
- You swim in mourning. Come to me.

665
00:58:02,796 --> 00:58:09,260
- Want something? A large soda?
- No thanks.

666
00:58:09,384 --> 00:58:15,140
- I'm about a 7-eleven.
- What are you doing? Now I'm worried.

667
00:58:15,265 --> 00:58:19,436
There's never a positive thing
by a 7-eleven.

668
00:58:19,561 --> 00:58:21,689
Relax, Javier.

669
00:58:21,814 --> 00:58:25,482
Leave the spot.
7- eleven sending people to jail.

670
00:58:25,608 --> 00:58:28,610
Goodbye. We'll talk later.

671
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:32,657
- I have downloaded refreshments.
- Fine.

672
00:58:32,782 --> 00:58:38,495
- What did you purchase?
- Refreshments. Run now.

673
00:58:38,621 --> 00:58:42,249
- What did you purchase?
- Something extra.

674
00:58:49,632 --> 00:58:52,009
How exciting!

675
00:58:54,845 --> 00:58:56,555
Really.

676
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:59,057
Come on.

677
00:59:01,476 --> 00:59:06,232
- I will not participate in illegal activities.
- I paid.

678
00:59:06,357 --> 00:59:09,485
But any contribution
received with thanks.

679
00:59:09,610 --> 00:59:12,195
Cheers.

680
00:59:13,447 --> 00:59:18,702
All the writing ambitions, I had
goes up in smoke when I have drunk out.

681
00:59:18,827 --> 00:59:21,412
Be on my side now.

682
00:59:29,170 --> 00:59:33,090
- Lovely, no?
- Sure.

683
00:59:33,216 --> 00:59:35,176
Let's go!

684
00:59:42,474 --> 00:59:45,436
I will not do anything stupid.

685
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:50,440
Shasta! How is it
going out with a pedophile?

686
00:59:50,565 --> 00:59:53,986
Bea! Where does
stunning dress from?

687
00:59:56,738 --> 01:00:03,120
- Shasta. Who made your dress?
- Forever 21st But it's secret.

688
01:00:03,245 --> 01:00:05,873
Who is he?

689
01:00:09,126 --> 01:00:12,671
Think that everything is finished.

690
01:00:16,341 --> 01:00:19,094
Come!

691
01:00:31,897 --> 01:00:34,608
- Wow...
- Relax.

692
01:00:36,486 --> 01:00:41,490
I can see that Henry and Shasta
dancing very close together.

693
01:00:41,615 --> 01:00:46,205
- You're beautiful tonight.
- Add! Rape!

694
01:00:46,330 --> 01:00:48,414
Listen, Mary...

695
01:00:51,625 --> 01:00:55,171
- My dance moves are archaic.
- Move.

696
01:01:30,956 --> 01:01:32,582
Rockville prom

697
01:01:33,791 --> 01:01:38,254
"Lauren was so beautiful that I
could hardly look at her. "

698
01:01:38,379 --> 01:01:44,136
"And the school's norms forbade her
look at me. She was too popular. "

699
01:01:44,260 --> 01:01:47,264
"She was
with a football player. "

700
01:01:48,555 --> 01:01:54,353
"She went to dance with him. I took
not. I would not see them. "

701
01:01:54,478 --> 01:01:57,398
"Ballet's king and queen. "

702
01:02:00,609 --> 01:02:04,112
"I sent a bouquet anonymously. "

703
01:02:04,237 --> 01:02:09,201
"On balaftenen I waited outside
to see if she Barden. "

704
01:02:10,326 --> 01:02:16,208
"She did not. Ridiculous,
but I would be in her life. "

705
01:02:17,542 --> 01:02:22,298
"The day after I was sick
to avoid Lauren. "

706
01:02:26,927 --> 01:02:30,763
Will not you?

707
01:02:30,889 --> 01:02:34,141
No, I can not.
It was nice...

708
01:02:34,267 --> 01:02:39,271
- We are away from the party for ten minutes.
- I've been here extend.

709
01:02:39,396 --> 01:02:45,194
Think of it as velgørened, Henry.
You can drag it from your taxes.

710
01:02:45,319 --> 01:02:51,158
- For what cause?
- Because I want it. Why not?

711
01:02:51,283 --> 01:02:55,329
- Come on.
- Just not the family.

712
01:02:56,413 --> 01:03:00,125
So take home.
It's probably your mother calling.

713
01:03:04,545 --> 01:03:06,048
REJECT

714
01:03:13,556 --> 01:03:20,728
- Only ten minutes.
- I promise it'll be fun.

715
01:03:21,646 --> 01:03:24,524
Enjoy it!

716
01:03:24,649 --> 01:03:28,402
Hello! Oh god.

717
01:03:28,527 --> 01:03:31,030
Hello.

718
01:03:31,155 --> 01:03:33,282
Come on, Henry.

719
01:03:33,407 --> 01:03:38,997
- I'll get drinks.
- Okay.

720
01:04:03,478 --> 01:04:06,398
Go ahead.

721
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:14,657
Okay...
You do not do.

722
01:04:14,782 --> 01:04:19,786
- You have no ring on your finger.
- I do not want one around the ankle.

723
01:04:21,746 --> 01:04:26,208
- Okay. Is this OK?
- Yes.

724
01:04:26,333 --> 01:04:29,587
Keep hands at rest,
then it's okay.

725
01:04:29,712 --> 01:04:31,338
How?

726
01:04:34,841 --> 01:04:38,930
Do not you think
I know what I'm doing?

727
01:04:39,055 --> 01:04:43,435
Why did you say yes,
To not complete it?

728
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:45,727
I promise...

729
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:50,774
- ... That you will not regret it.
- I know...

730
01:04:50,899 --> 01:04:57,823
...But to go ahead with it here
benefit to ringing of us in the future.

731
01:04:57,948 --> 01:05:03,745
- What do you think now?
- To kiss a girl on the 18th..

732
01:05:04,788 --> 01:05:10,877
...Can not the entire
my 20 hogget heartache.

733
01:05:14,422 --> 01:05:20,428
What a bitch!
And I'm paying the price.

734
01:05:20,553 --> 01:05:24,350
- Police!
- Damn it. Come on.

735
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:28,311
- Come on.
- Oh god. Races.

736
01:05:40,531 --> 01:05:44,202
- What? Oh god.
- You must.

737
01:05:44,327 --> 01:05:46,579
Hop.

738
01:05:46,704 --> 01:05:52,960
Trust me. Otherwise you are going
same exercise at rehab.

739
01:05:57,631 --> 01:05:59,634
The party is over!

740
01:06:15,524 --> 01:06:22,322
- Can you imagine anything better?
- Yes, I could watch "Cops" on TV.

741
01:06:22,447 --> 01:06:24,824
I love "Cops".

742
01:06:24,949 --> 01:06:28,494
I've learned
not to run from police.

743
01:06:35,752 --> 01:06:38,797
He is here.

744
01:06:41,465 --> 01:06:44,593
Get out of the bush.

745
01:06:46,345 --> 01:06:49,640
It is not
what it seems to be.

746
01:06:52,309 --> 01:06:54,979
It provides me.

747
01:06:55,104 --> 01:06:58,232
- Have you been drinking?
- No, not at all.

748
01:07:01,776 --> 01:07:03,368
Vodka?

749
01:07:03,403 --> 01:07:09,576
"When my friend Bryan came out of the closet
he became the school's sole gay. "

750
01:07:09,701 --> 01:07:13,246
"Afterwards I'd rather not
circumvented him. "

751
01:07:13,372 --> 01:07:18,250
"It was hard enough without being
paired with another idiot. "

752
01:07:19,419 --> 01:07:26,008
"To be accepted by the cool
I threw eggs at Bryan's car. "

753
01:07:26,133 --> 01:07:32,056
"We wrote 'pussy' with soap
and covered the car with the Volume "-

754
01:07:32,182 --> 01:07:35,852
- "To indicate
- That he should have been a woman. "

755
01:07:36,728 --> 01:07:43,734
I hit the kid to death. "Bryan"?
He could have chosen "Trevor. "

756
01:07:50,657 --> 01:07:55,412
You are not previously convicted.
So we have only a 37-year-old -

757
01:07:55,537 --> 01:07:58,707
are to teenage party.

758
01:07:58,832 --> 01:08:02,545
- McCanthy?
- Hey, Bird.

759
01:08:02,669 --> 01:08:05,089
I'll make it.

760
01:08:08,634 --> 01:08:14,473
- I swear. There is nothing has happened.
- Jaså.

761
01:08:20,728 --> 01:08:22,730
You can just that.

762
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:27,402
- Make it right.
- Thanks.

763
01:08:29,069 --> 01:08:31,530
He may like to go now.

764
01:08:31,655 --> 01:08:37,621
- I'm so embarrassed.
- It is better to get it over with now.

765
01:08:37,746 --> 01:08:41,624
- Henry.
- Wow.

766
01:08:43,459 --> 01:08:47,172
- Oh god.
- Yes.

767
01:08:49,799 --> 01:08:54,804
"You are too much"?
Yes, I am.

768
01:08:54,929 --> 01:08:57,057
- Oh yes.
- Oh no.

769
01:09:11,611 --> 01:09:16,158
Come on.
Jump in, young lady.

770
01:09:16,283 --> 01:09:21,037
I apologize. She comes
at least unscathed home.

771
01:09:21,163 --> 01:09:26,751
I can not hurt you anymore
than your dad does when he sees the car.

772
01:09:34,425 --> 01:09:36,177
Pussy

773
01:09:36,302 --> 01:09:37,762
YOU ARE TOO MUCH

774
01:09:37,887 --> 01:09:40,890
THE CAR IS HERE FOR SEJ
TO A NARRØV

775
01:09:41,015 --> 01:09:43,226
Sorry, Dad.

776
01:09:43,351 --> 01:09:48,939
How in heaven's name
have you been with her?

777
01:09:49,064 --> 01:09:52,067
It's just superficial.
I'll fix it.

778
01:09:52,192 --> 01:09:57,073
Do not play smart right now.

779
01:09:57,198 --> 01:09:58,865
Sorry.

780
01:09:58,990 --> 01:10:05,038
I pull it from your pocket money.
From your heritage, I mean.

781
01:10:09,584 --> 01:10:14,756
- How's the speech?
- I'm not begun. I know.

782
01:10:15,674 --> 01:10:21,554
A Scarlet called. I said
you'd be home tonight.

783
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:25,850
- Do you give me grounded?
- You do not get the Cadillac.

784
01:10:25,975 --> 01:10:29,521
I have two legs.
I can go over to her.

785
01:10:43,409 --> 01:10:46,287
Pick up the phone.

786
01:10:54,921 --> 01:10:57,673
Come on.

787
01:11:00,467 --> 01:11:01,968
Damn it.

788
01:11:04,095 --> 01:11:10,269
"One must act. At the back you get
not the high scores and the girl. "

789
01:11:10,394 --> 01:11:15,023
"I moved forward, and Lauren
risked failure in chemistry. "

790
01:11:15,147 --> 01:11:20,904
"This cairn perfect opportunity
genius to rescue a lady in distress. "

791
01:11:21,821 --> 01:11:25,032
The city's gay?
I weighed 200 kilograms!

792
01:11:25,157 --> 01:11:29,119
It was long
before I realized what I had to.

793
01:11:30,288 --> 01:11:33,208
Would you like it
I did by car?

794
01:11:34,917 --> 01:11:37,295
Stop it.

795
01:11:45,845 --> 01:11:48,848
Hello, Heidl.
That was what Wayne got.

796
01:11:50,807 --> 01:11:53,685
Hello, hello!

797
01:11:53,811 --> 01:11:57,272
What have we here?

798
01:11:58,482 --> 01:12:03,362
- Enough is enough.
- What happens?

799
01:12:06,740 --> 01:12:08,868
Sorry, sorry.

800
01:12:13,413 --> 01:12:14,956
Bitch.

801
01:12:15,081 --> 01:12:21,463
"Lauren would know I existed.
I helped her kemilektierne "-

802
01:12:21,588 --> 01:12:26,425
- "But the only thing that was hot,
- Were Bunsen burners. "

803
01:12:26,551 --> 01:12:33,474
"Yes, I did it more complicated
to be with her. "

804
01:12:33,599 --> 01:12:38,562
"I was distracted
of her skin, eyes and hair. "

805
01:12:38,687 --> 01:12:42,775
"In one way or another
she got top marks. "

806
01:12:42,901 --> 01:12:47,905
"The day she gave me a hug and
a kiss was my life's happiest. "

807
01:12:48,031 --> 01:12:50,741
"Like an angel's touch. "

808
01:12:50,866 --> 01:12:55,495
"The day she wrote in my yearbook:
'Continue to be tough' "

809
01:12:57,705 --> 01:13:02,336
"I thought it meant:
'I love you. "'

810
01:13:02,461 --> 01:13:04,922
What are you doing here?

811
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:08,591
- Is it too late?
- No. Come in.

812
01:13:08,716 --> 01:13:13,597
- I put my bike there.
- Yes. Sweet.

813
01:13:13,721 --> 01:13:19,352
One of the reasons that I called,
was that I read your book.

814
01:13:19,477 --> 01:13:23,605
I just wanted to hear
how much of what is true?

815
01:13:26,067 --> 01:13:27,902
Everything except sexen.

816
01:13:29,572 --> 01:13:34,075
Well. The girl
you write about, Lauren...

817
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:40,080
I was really touched.
Touched by...

818
01:13:40,206 --> 01:13:45,920
You wrote so beautifully about her. She must
be special, inspirational.

819
01:13:46,045 --> 01:13:48,465
She is both.

820
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:51,384
Who is she?

821
01:13:51,509 --> 01:13:54,011
Who do you think?

822
01:14:01,059 --> 01:14:04,354
- Scarlet! Come out!
- What?

823
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:07,817
- What are you doing?
- It does not matter.

824
01:14:07,942 --> 01:14:12,988
- Go away. I'm calling the police.
- I bitch him.

825
01:14:13,114 --> 01:14:15,406
No, no, no.

826
01:14:18,242 --> 01:14:25,333
He chases me till he finds me.
Let's get it over with.

827
01:14:25,458 --> 01:14:29,463
Here is your ridiculous BMX bike.

828
01:14:29,588 --> 01:14:31,797
What do you say?

829
01:14:37,553 --> 01:14:40,681
What do you say?

830
01:14:55,905 --> 01:14:58,740
Let her be.

831
01:15:25,849 --> 01:15:29,353
- How is he?
- I do not know.

832
01:15:36,444 --> 01:15:40,365
- (Put your arm around her.)
- (Should I?)

833
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:51,208
I must get to him.

834
01:16:17,692 --> 01:16:21,947
- Hello, boys.
- What have you done?

835
01:16:24,074 --> 01:16:30,246
- Was it only here?
- Yes. Plus a couple of ribs.

836
01:16:30,371 --> 01:16:35,960
- I told you. Not?
- Jo.

837
01:16:40,005 --> 01:16:43,217
We remove anything
The dried blood.

838
01:16:43,342 --> 01:16:49,348
We played ever Doctor.
This do not you write a book.

839
01:16:49,473 --> 01:16:53,226
Good.
Stay behind the typewriter.

840
01:16:53,351 --> 01:16:55,604
Brawl?

841
01:16:56,689 --> 01:16:59,191
I'll pick a doctor.

842
01:16:59,316 --> 01:17:02,111
Hello, wino.

843
01:17:02,236 --> 01:17:05,489
- Is Scarlet here?
- Yes, outside.

844
01:17:05,614 --> 01:17:10,912
- It hurts.
- Sorry. Look at this.

845
01:17:15,039 --> 01:17:18,000
I'll come tomorrow.

846
01:17:21,337 --> 01:17:23,881
ER

847
01:17:24,007 --> 01:17:29,805
I have done.
I have read it and it is miserable.

848
01:17:29,930 --> 01:17:34,516
It is miserable. I've said it...
Nobody will care about it.

849
01:17:34,642 --> 01:17:38,854
A story about someone who sells fertilizer.
No one will bother reading it.

850
01:17:40,273 --> 01:17:42,525
Henry...

851
01:17:42,650 --> 01:17:45,611
Henry? If you can hear me
it is Javier.

852
01:17:47,905 --> 01:17:53,326
- Hi, Javier.
- You're not in a coma. Are you stunned?

853
01:17:55,329 --> 01:17:59,666
- What is it?
- It's a local review.

854
01:17:59,791 --> 01:18:04,839
"Mr McCanthy saves us hopefully
multiply nonsense during the speech. "

855
01:18:04,964 --> 01:18:10,344
She thinks probably something else.
"It inspires only to suicide. "

856
01:18:10,469 --> 01:18:14,389
- Who's Fields?
- I do not know.

857
01:18:14,514 --> 01:18:18,768
I've probably thrown eggs
at her house sometime.

858
01:18:19,728 --> 01:18:23,397
You must get away from here,
before you end up in death the ads.

859
01:18:23,522 --> 01:18:26,943
It would be good
but I can not.

860
01:18:27,068 --> 01:18:30,447
The locals do not like you.

861
01:18:30,572 --> 01:18:37,703
I cancel the speech and television interview
today. We take the first plane.

862
01:18:37,828 --> 01:18:42,583
If I go now, I write
about it here the next 20 years.

863
01:18:43,710 --> 01:18:46,504
I want to change the subject.

864
01:18:46,629 --> 01:18:51,008
- How Lionel struck me out?
- Get me to the translocation.

865
01:18:53,511 --> 01:18:59,433
Download photos from prom
Today at. 15-16. And now: Sports.

866
01:18:59,558 --> 01:19:01,935
Sorry.

867
01:19:02,061 --> 01:19:06,356
One would think that we advertise
unite book about domestic violence.

868
01:19:07,399 --> 01:19:10,944
You know what?
One of my stroke sufferers.

869
01:19:11,069 --> 01:19:14,906
- I know not where.
- I'll just digest.

870
01:19:15,031 --> 01:19:21,579
People love writers who see
torn and battered out. It is now.

871
01:19:30,588 --> 01:19:35,467
Hi, all students.
Today we speak with Henry McCanthy.

872
01:19:35,592 --> 01:19:40,557
How did you get the title
"How Lionel gave me sex"?

873
01:19:40,682 --> 01:19:43,017
It is the singer...

874
01:19:43,142 --> 01:19:48,772
His music has so affected you?
- Yes. I was not as popular as...

875
01:19:48,897 --> 01:19:55,111
He was popular,
and he got enough many sex.

876
01:19:57,823 --> 01:20:01,409
"I created a philosophy
in the last school. "

877
01:20:01,534 --> 01:20:07,791
"I focus on living
Instead of worrying me "-

878
01:20:07,916 --> 01:20:13,838
- "I'd enjoy your time on earth
more and would probably have sex. "

879
01:20:13,963 --> 01:20:16,467
"At least once. "

880
01:20:17,758 --> 01:20:23,181
"Later I discovered that what I
had learned in school, came back. "

881
01:20:24,432 --> 01:20:27,518
"I could not see
no end to it. "

882
01:20:27,643 --> 01:20:31,606
"I got top grades in school
but why I dumped in life? "

883
01:20:31,732 --> 01:20:36,194
"Was it necessary to get it
refreshed in West Rockville? "

884
01:20:37,778 --> 01:20:43,367
You've got a decent game?
I can help you. Who was it?

885
01:20:43,493 --> 01:20:45,370
It's nothing.

886
01:20:45,495 --> 01:20:48,957
- Will they also expelled?
- If necessary.

887
01:20:49,082 --> 01:20:55,004
It goes if you let me go
through to get the speech approved.

888
01:20:55,129 --> 01:21:00,175
There is a jogging track,
and there are guest entrances.

889
01:21:00,926 --> 01:21:04,930
"72% of graduating class
want to take antidepressants. "

890
01:21:05,055 --> 01:21:08,308
"61% will be divorced. "
Interesting.

891
01:21:11,436 --> 01:21:16,358
It's funny, shocking
and gifted, but it does not.

892
01:21:16,483 --> 01:21:20,028
They listen safely
the frightening statistics...

893
01:21:20,153 --> 01:21:24,366
- ... But it has no effect.
- The truth does not sell.

894
01:21:24,490 --> 01:21:29,704
"A voice rage is the best speech
you will regret "- Laurence Peter.

895
01:21:29,829 --> 01:21:31,539
Thank you.

896
01:21:32,874 --> 01:21:37,878
There is no time to write something
you can approve.

897
01:21:40,257 --> 01:21:42,508
This you have already done.

898
01:21:42,634 --> 01:21:46,595
Henry!
Your suitcase is here!

899
01:21:46,721 --> 01:21:51,350
"Although it was uncomfortable, forced
school me to be myself. "

900
01:21:51,475 --> 01:21:54,520
"It was also my clothes. "

901
01:22:02,570 --> 01:22:06,656
I would like to introduce to you -

902
01:22:06,781 --> 01:22:12,287
unite with my... favorite students.

903
01:22:14,081 --> 01:22:19,794
He attended school a few years ago
and is now a succesrigforfatter.

904
01:22:19,919 --> 01:22:24,257
Bid our speeches Henry McCanthy
welcome.

905
01:22:27,844 --> 01:22:31,889
Thank you, thank you. Thank you.

906
01:22:33,224 --> 01:22:37,145
I will read aloud from a little book
I rancid reef.

907
01:22:37,270 --> 01:22:41,815
"I learned that we tackle
situations differently. "

908
01:22:41,940 --> 01:22:46,904
"Colors, shapes and emotions" -

909
01:22:47,029 --> 01:22:50,783
"Vary according
what we need them to. "

910
01:22:50,908 --> 01:22:53,828
"I sat for a long
with each situation. "

911
01:22:53,953 --> 01:22:58,623
"I gave care and attention
to the situation. "

912
01:22:58,749 --> 01:23:03,420
"I was wondering if it would hatch
and become a beautiful memory... "

913
01:23:04,380 --> 01:23:07,591
"... Or would it fade away?"

914
01:23:07,716 --> 01:23:11,386
"I stand here
because of the memorial. "

915
01:23:11,511 --> 01:23:15,349
"It jumps
from head to heart... "

916
01:23:16,308 --> 01:23:18,685
"... And to my stomach. "

917
01:23:18,810 --> 01:23:22,773
"The memory could not be saved
anywhere, not even in the book. "

918
01:23:22,898 --> 01:23:29,612
"It has affected my way of speaking
and the way I live. "

919
01:23:29,737 --> 01:23:33,490
"Our memories make us what
we are. "

920
01:23:33,616 --> 01:23:37,620
"These four years
become only memories. "

921
01:23:37,745 --> 01:23:43,042
"I can not define them,
but they can define who you are. "

922
01:23:45,169 --> 01:23:46,962
Congratulations.

923
01:23:51,884 --> 01:23:53,385
More, Henry!

924
01:24:10,069 --> 01:24:11,610
Chester, right?

925
01:24:13,948 --> 01:24:18,117
Thanks! It was a good speech.

926
01:24:18,242 --> 01:24:20,662
Take care of yourself.

927
01:24:22,496 --> 01:24:25,249
- Tax...

928
01:24:25,374 --> 01:24:28,836
Excellent speech.
I have to catch the plane.

929
01:24:28,962 --> 01:24:33,466
- I get along. Go now, Javier.
- Great.

930
01:24:33,592 --> 01:24:35,468
Call me!

931
01:24:38,262 --> 01:24:43,684
God created Ihop.
Selected Ihop, and there was Ihop.

932
01:24:45,311 --> 01:24:51,025
You came not to speak to one thousand
students, but to speak with one.

933
01:24:51,984 --> 01:24:56,112
Well, it is as it is.

934
01:24:56,238 --> 01:25:01,076
- She is who she is.
- "It is as it is," he says.

935
01:25:02,577 --> 01:25:06,373
Do you know
what I will say about it?

936
01:25:07,541 --> 01:25:09,333
Oh no.

937
01:25:09,458 --> 01:25:12,796
Sometimes in my life

938
01:25:14,256 --> 01:25:17,342
I asked why

939
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:24,641
Yet I believe
it will go

940
01:25:28,227 --> 01:25:33,149
You think that it's over

941
01:25:33,274 --> 01:25:37,237
- But only if you want it
- Exactly.

942
01:25:37,362 --> 01:25:41,782
- Waiting for a sign
- A miracle

943
01:25:41,907 --> 01:25:44,993
or would you fight

944
01:25:45,118 --> 01:25:47,163
It is now

945
01:25:47,288 --> 01:25:51,125
You know
where you are

946
01:25:51,250 --> 01:25:55,086
you must fight yourself out

947
01:25:56,255 --> 01:25:59,801
stop closing their eyes

948
01:26:17,650 --> 01:26:19,320
Henry?

949
01:26:20,696 --> 01:26:23,782
- What are you doing?
- Look what you're doing.

950
01:26:23,907 --> 01:26:30,120
I considered to be an outsider
with a boombox.

951
01:26:31,582 --> 01:26:36,626
Is this your room?
To see the words out.

952
01:26:39,504 --> 01:26:44,051
"If I just got a kiss
by Lauren... "

953
01:26:44,176 --> 01:26:47,387
I was wondering
about Lionel would get me sex.

954
01:26:47,512 --> 01:26:53,519
"... As I kissed her in my
dream, life would be perfected. "

955
01:26:53,644 --> 01:26:57,773
- Are you okay?
- I ignore that I am shaking.

956
01:27:12,788 --> 01:27:16,666
"Lionel words
taught me something about love... "

957
01:27:19,085 --> 01:27:21,004
"... Loyalty... "

958
01:27:22,213 --> 01:27:24,423
"... Desire... "

959
01:27:24,548 --> 01:27:26,842
"... And romance. "

960
01:27:28,469 --> 01:27:32,223
- I will shoot you.
- "The family taught me tolerance. "

961
01:27:32,349 --> 01:27:34,851
Should I take the picture?

962
01:27:34,976 --> 01:27:40,856
Friends gave me community
and Lauren cairn ideal woman. "

963
01:27:41,524 --> 01:27:45,904
Follow your own advice.
Have you read the book?

964
01:27:46,028 --> 01:27:50,532
"I wonder if she looks like
the woman I fantasized about "-

965
01:27:50,658 --> 01:27:55,162
- "Or whether I've found
on the whole to remain alone. "

966
01:27:55,288 --> 01:27:58,792
Wake up.
We must support Henry, wino.

967
01:27:58,916 --> 01:28:05,630
"Why do you otherwise unite
unattainable girl with a perfect guy? "

968
01:28:07,300 --> 01:28:12,219
- I love you, Scarlet.
- "Imagination on Lauren taught me... "

969
01:28:12,344 --> 01:28:16,891
"... To take life,
as it comes... "

970
01:28:17,016 --> 01:28:18,560
Henry.

971
01:28:18,685 --> 01:28:23,899
"... Conquer fear and quit
carry around unfulfilled dreams. "

972
01:28:24,024 --> 01:28:27,985
- Continue to be tough.
- Okay.

973
01:28:30,738 --> 01:28:34,867
"Some nights I think of
what happened to Lauren. "

974
01:28:34,992 --> 01:28:40,872
"Did herself with sports guy?
Does she have children? She remembers me? "

975
01:28:40,997 --> 01:28:45,587
"Well, now I'm not
afraid The love. "

976
01:28:45,712 --> 01:28:51,050
"My heart is perhaps crushed again
but I know I will survive. "
