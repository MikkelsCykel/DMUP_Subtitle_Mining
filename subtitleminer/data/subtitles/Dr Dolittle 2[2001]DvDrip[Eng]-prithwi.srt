1
00:01:05,531 --> 00:01:08,682
Welcome to San Francisco,
the city on the bay.

2
00:01:08,771 --> 00:01:15,723
With its 30,000 hydrants, 4 million
tennis balls and flexible in-the-gutter-law.

3
00:01:15,811 --> 00:01:21,170
I'm Lucky. A dog, if you have
not had. And this is my boss.

4
00:01:21,252 --> 00:01:24,561
You know Dr. Dolittle right?
The guy who can talking with animals.

5
00:01:24,652 --> 00:01:29,044
Let me just catch up.
He is a doctor and talk to animals.

6
00:01:29,132 --> 00:01:31,044
He is busier than ever.

7
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:35,251
You have Mr. Carson for ten hours
and the ECG of Mr. Wennington at 12 hours.

8
00:01:35,332 --> 00:01:38,405
Mrs. Bloom has rash.
I am 11. 15 said.

9
00:01:38,493 --> 00:01:44,046
Buster ontwormen, then the cough of Misty.
And after an hour nothing but castraties.

10
00:01:44,133 --> 00:01:47,045
- Dinner of the Rotary.
- Breakfast at the Kennel Club.

11
00:01:47,134 --> 00:01:52,925
Do Carson at 11 am, Buster 12,
the ECG and Misty at 12. 30 to 1. 15.

12
00:01:53,014 --> 00:01:56,643
And sorting my files.
I had almost Mr. Panitch castrated.

13
00:01:56,735 --> 00:01:59,771
As you would Mrs. Panitch
a fun with it.

14
00:01:59,854 --> 00:02:01,845
You're welcome, ladies.

15
00:02:01,935 --> 00:02:05,211
How busy he had,
Doc helped all animals.

16
00:02:05,615 --> 00:02:09,654
- Hello. I'm Bandit.
- How you doing, Bandit?

17
00:02:09,735 --> 00:02:13,045
- And I'm a stray dog.
- Shows nothing.

18
00:02:13,135 --> 00:02:15,888
We know that your first time.

19
00:02:15,975 --> 00:02:18,171
You do the leg to leg.

20
00:02:18,255 --> 00:02:23,171
Exactly. Never give up hope.
This applies to all of you.

21
00:02:23,256 --> 00:02:27,454
Any dog can find a family
person and his faithful pet.

22
00:02:27,536 --> 00:02:32,007
Say after me:
I am someone's faithful pet.

23
00:02:32,096 --> 00:02:35,453
Again.
I am someone's faithful pet.

24
00:02:39,897 --> 00:02:43,732
A family in North Beach
looking for a good watchdog,

25
00:02:43,817 --> 00:02:48,333
that love for children.
Anyone here experience in security?

26
00:02:48,417 --> 00:02:50,613
Then Rusty gotta have.

27
00:02:50,698 --> 00:02:54,407
Who is Rusty?

28
00:02:54,499 --> 00:02:58,458
- Is it important?
- No, Rusty.

29
00:02:59,259 --> 00:03:01,488
It says: Can not lick...

30
00:03:01,578 --> 00:03:02,853
on his ass.

31
00:03:03,818 --> 00:03:08,255
Each zoo wanted him.
He was especially good in soul choked.

32
00:03:08,338 --> 00:03:10,853
When was your party last Friday?

33
00:03:10,938 --> 00:03:13,657
Not so long ago. A year or 20.

34
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:16,492
Monday was 48 years ago.

35
00:03:16,818 --> 00:03:19,492
I see what the problem is.

36
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:22,651
I give you pills for your eating to do.

37
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,173
What are they?

38
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,329
What you look hot.

39
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,456
I'll be there, baby.

40
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:36,012
He became an international star,
from Alaska to Australia.

41
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:41,414
I stand here next to the famous Dr. Dolittle,
which the animals talk.

42
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:46,336
We are an unsuspecting alligator
stalk and save.

43
00:03:46,421 --> 00:03:49,299
Still, he hears otherwise.

44
00:03:49,381 --> 00:03:54,250
The trick to catching alligators,
is that you should watch out for their teeth.

45
00:03:54,341 --> 00:03:59,257
I let Steve think that I do not doorheb
that he is behind me.

46
00:03:59,342 --> 00:04:05,099
I wait until he wants to tackle me, then turn
I huppekee around, his arm off.

47
00:04:05,183 --> 00:04:08,141
I turn my arm around his neck and...

48
00:04:08,223 --> 00:04:11,771
- Steve, he knows that we are here.
- I have to surprise him.

49
00:04:11,863 --> 00:04:13,262
Now.

50
00:04:14,742 --> 00:04:16,142
Jeez, my arm.

51
00:04:20,623 --> 00:04:23,218
Everyone wanted to help the good doctor.

52
00:04:23,303 --> 00:04:27,216
His family understood. Largely.

53
00:04:27,303 --> 00:04:30,979
But there shortly.
Now moetik the door open.

54
00:04:33,024 --> 00:04:36,414
- Who's there?
- I forgot my key.

55
00:04:36,504 --> 00:04:39,815
Then you'll have to beg.
Go ahead, kid.

56
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:42,372
You know him? Reverse world.

57
00:04:42,464 --> 00:04:44,774
Because usually it is the man

58
00:04:44,865 --> 00:04:50,497
- Against the dog says...
- Put the door open but now, Lucky.

59
00:04:50,585 --> 00:04:55,057
Because you give me food,
I leave you this time inside.

60
00:04:58,266 --> 00:05:00,574
Who's back from France?

61
00:05:02,146 --> 00:05:04,137
- Hello, darling.
- How is it?

62
00:05:06,986 --> 00:05:09,022
I have a gift for you.

63
00:05:09,106 --> 00:05:12,019
- Is that for me?
- For you. For us.

64
00:05:12,106 --> 00:05:14,940
I enjoy the fun with this gift.

65
00:05:16,227 --> 00:05:21,062
You know what a nice gift would be?
If you crowd had disappeared.

66
00:05:21,147 --> 00:05:23,422
I will talk to them.

67
00:05:23,507 --> 00:05:25,498
- Papa.
- How is it, honey?

68
00:05:25,588 --> 00:05:30,378
- I have something for you from Mexico.
- Gracias. What can it be?

69
00:05:31,027 --> 00:05:33,063
Earthquake. Alarm.

70
00:05:33,148 --> 00:05:37,026
- Do not shake it.
- My spleen. Pain.

71
00:05:37,108 --> 00:05:39,861
- What a baby.
- This is not Puerto Vallarta.

72
00:05:39,948 --> 00:05:42,940
It is a chameleon.
This change of color.

73
00:05:43,029 --> 00:05:46,704
Make way for the disappearing maestro.
Attention, big trick.

74
00:05:46,788 --> 00:05:49,428
Doll seen close box.

75
00:05:49,508 --> 00:05:52,820
- We can still see.
- Really?

76
00:05:52,908 --> 00:05:57,425
- Have you thought to Charisse's birthday?
- Have your cake?

77
00:05:57,509 --> 00:06:01,388
- They do not want to celebrate with us.
- Why not?

78
00:06:01,469 --> 00:06:04,382
- We always do.
- Is there anything green?

79
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:07,985
- Bring that thing to your room.
- Guacamole? A pickle?

80
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,901
She has a date.

81
00:06:09,991 --> 00:06:11,469
What?

82
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:15,782
- Who?
- Have I not asked. She is great.

83
00:06:15,871 --> 00:06:19,021
That we will ever see.
Where is she?

84
00:06:19,111 --> 00:06:21,989
- They can not speak.
- Why? Where is she?

85
00:06:22,071 --> 00:06:25,780
In her room with the door locked.
You can SMS her.

86
00:06:25,872 --> 00:06:30,991
She is home and I can not speak?
I have her SMS?

87
00:06:31,072 --> 00:06:33,949
That we will ever see.
Nothing SMS.

88
00:06:35,351 --> 00:06:39,105
Careful. She is 16.
That is a difficult age.

89
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:41,989
Open the door.

90
00:06:42,072 --> 00:06:44,870
- Do not believe it.
- Try her cell phone.

91
00:06:44,952 --> 00:06:48,661
I ga her mobile phone
in her bedroom.

92
00:06:52,953 --> 00:06:54,387
Open the door.

93
00:07:08,033 --> 00:07:11,663
These teenagers, though.
You should it go bust.

94
00:07:12,674 --> 00:07:14,824
- What are you drinking?
- Gatorade.

95
00:07:14,914 --> 00:07:16,905
Oh, yeah? Please come here.

96
00:07:18,194 --> 00:07:20,390
Gatorade even makes wine?

97
00:07:21,514 --> 00:07:23,312
Do be quiet, you.

98
00:07:25,035 --> 00:07:28,072
- Who of you is Dolittle?
- What now?

99
00:07:28,155 --> 00:07:31,147
- I got a message from the chef.
- From whom?

100
00:07:31,235 --> 00:07:34,147
The Peet Bever.
No questions, come with me.

101
00:07:34,396 --> 00:07:39,185
You will not invade.
First, make an appointment.

102
00:07:39,276 --> 00:07:41,744
Say that but at that beaver.

103
00:07:41,835 --> 00:07:44,396
Then I can sleep with the fishes.

104
00:07:44,476 --> 00:07:48,709
I would like in the paper that Dr Dolittle
an opossum from the roof throws?

105
00:07:48,796 --> 00:07:51,629
- No. But I do it.
- Watch your words.

106
00:07:58,757 --> 00:08:00,987
- Say it again.
- With Dad. How are you?

107
00:08:01,077 --> 00:08:02,635
I want to ask.

108
00:08:02,717 --> 00:08:06,710
Why should I rise against the house
to talk to you?

109
00:08:06,798 --> 00:08:08,789
Dad, where are you?

110
00:08:10,398 --> 00:08:14,914
- Dad, what are you doing?
- I can just reach.

111
00:08:14,998 --> 00:08:17,466
What are you doing here? And what is that?

112
00:08:17,638 --> 00:08:20,153
- Do you think in public?
- Dancing?

113
00:08:20,238 --> 00:08:24,311
That is not dancing but sjansen.
Why four you disagree with us?

114
00:08:24,398 --> 00:08:27,994
A dinner with the whole family
is something for when you're small.

115
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:31,230
- I have a date.
- Bring the boy along.

116
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:35,437
Sure. ''Eric, my parents and sister
go along on our date. ''

117
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,274
No, he may join our trip.
That is tradition.

118
00:08:39,359 --> 00:08:41,351
I do not even know why...

119
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,676
- What is this?
- It is private.

120
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:49,356
Because you ashamed, for sure.
You have two zesminnen and five.

121
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:55,037
I ashamed? You are the last
those which may say.

122
00:08:55,121 --> 00:08:58,636
What are you talking about?
What do you mean?

123
00:09:01,001 --> 00:09:06,156
Should not I help animals
Because you ashamed you have?

124
00:09:06,241 --> 00:09:09,551
- That happens anyway.
- Exactly.

125
00:09:09,641 --> 00:09:12,201
You go out to eat.
Look.

126
00:09:12,281 --> 00:09:15,718
- A week is not GSM.
- What should I not GSM?

127
00:09:15,801 --> 00:09:19,351
Here, stamps to write letters.

128
00:09:19,442 --> 00:09:22,276
Look at me.
You think what I could care?

129
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:25,798
Look at me.
Can I shit?

130
00:09:25,882 --> 00:09:27,873
Hell, no.

131
00:09:29,963 --> 00:09:33,511
There are 50 numbers and I is not here.

132
00:09:33,603 --> 00:09:36,402
- Since you can not see.
- Why not?

133
00:09:37,603 --> 00:09:39,673
Biggie Mack GSM.

134
00:09:39,763 --> 00:09:41,833
Biggie Mack SMS. Biggie Mack home.

135
00:09:41,924 --> 00:09:44,801
- Who is Biggie Mack?
- No idea.

136
00:09:45,564 --> 00:09:49,716
Since I'll be back.
What is that name? I think it is anything but.

137
00:09:51,803 --> 00:09:55,160
- What is that?
- The GSM of Marcus.

138
00:09:55,244 --> 00:09:58,919
- Since when has a cellphone?
- Since last week.

139
00:09:59,005 --> 00:10:02,155
- What are you doing?
- I see who is Biggie Mack.

140
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:07,358
- Who is this?
- Who is this?

141
00:10:07,445 --> 00:10:09,754
- Is this Biggie Mack?
- Who are you?

142
00:10:09,845 --> 00:10:12,598
I suggest here the questions snot.

143
00:10:12,685 --> 00:10:14,915
- How old are you?
- That is your business.

144
00:10:15,006 --> 00:10:17,155
Then I make it my business.

145
00:10:17,245 --> 00:10:20,795
- Is that a threat?
- I is not threatening, I promise alone.

146
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:24,356
- Is this John Dolittle?
- Sorry, I've turned bad.

147
00:10:24,446 --> 00:10:28,918
- That was a mature guy on the line.
- Not on this side.

148
00:10:31,847 --> 00:10:33,598
- The bell.
- That I hear it.

149
00:10:33,687 --> 00:10:37,201
- Please open it.
- Am I suddenly the butler here?

150
00:10:39,566 --> 00:10:41,364
I bowl.

151
00:10:43,048 --> 00:10:45,437
Hey, Dr D. How you doing? I am.

152
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:49,445
Who is I? Back, I do.

153
00:10:50,728 --> 00:10:52,400
Let me inside you, man?

154
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,768
- Dr D, all kits?
- Pardon?

155
00:10:56,848 --> 00:11:00,636
I, Eric. Domino's Pizza.
Extra cheese, anchovy, tomato...

156
00:11:00,729 --> 00:11:02,560
You are the pizza farm.

157
00:11:02,648 --> 00:11:07,676
- Thanks. I forgot you tip?
- You've given me something much better.

158
00:11:07,769 --> 00:11:10,043
- I get it on, because...
- Hi, Eric.

159
00:11:10,129 --> 00:11:12,085
How is he, honey? Are you ready?

160
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:15,957
- Is he your date?
- Dad, Eric. Eric, my Dad.

161
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:20,046
- Good man. Alles kits?
- No, Eric.

162
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:22,438
We must stay home to eat.

163
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,483
Fine.

164
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:30,559
Charisse not do.
Do not ruin it for everyone.

165
00:11:30,651 --> 00:11:35,645
You know, old man. Do not worry, man.
This strongly as I do.

166
00:11:37,451 --> 00:11:39,442
Old?

167
00:11:43,571 --> 00:11:47,565
When Charisse half was
they wanted no more diapers.

168
00:11:47,651 --> 00:11:49,323
Remember?

169
00:11:49,411 --> 00:11:53,643
She had on accidents, because they
still was not clean. There was...

170
00:11:53,732 --> 00:11:57,008
- You can not, huh?
- We are family.

171
00:11:57,092 --> 00:12:00,607
- Shows nothing. I learn something from.
- Oh, yeah?

172
00:12:00,692 --> 00:12:03,764
Because you have not learned
for your pet to do at the table.

173
00:12:03,852 --> 00:12:07,641
I get it hot
I look at you with your pet.

174
00:12:07,732 --> 00:12:09,404
Sixteen.

175
00:12:09,493 --> 00:12:13,566
In two years you can house,
study.

176
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,724
One year, 10 months and 16 days.

177
00:12:15,813 --> 00:12:20,045
If you go to Berkeley is
you can stay home.

178
00:12:20,133 --> 00:12:25,685
Good idea, but I have a moving van
hired after my graduation.

179
00:12:25,774 --> 00:12:30,370
- Do you have a rented van?
- Someone you want to speak.

180
00:12:30,574 --> 00:12:32,372
Yo. Come smoothing out.

181
00:12:32,894 --> 00:12:36,204
- Thank you. Sorry, honey.
- Bye, Dad. I love you.

182
00:12:36,294 --> 00:12:38,683
I love you too. Sorry, Eric.

183
00:12:40,254 --> 00:12:44,135
- Yes, here.
- What do you want?

184
00:12:44,215 --> 00:12:48,413
First of all, congratulations on your daughter
behalf of the beaver.

185
00:12:48,496 --> 00:12:52,647
Very nice. Say that beaver
on my nerves.

186
00:12:52,735 --> 00:12:56,171
Why so touchy?
He wants you just speak.

187
00:12:56,256 --> 00:13:00,169
- And if I say no?
- That seems to me unwise.

188
00:13:01,616 --> 00:13:04,892
Tomorrow morning at eight o'clock
in my consulting room.

189
00:13:04,976 --> 00:13:09,175
The beaver travel for anyone.
He knows you're a busy man.

190
00:13:09,256 --> 00:13:11,850
But this is a matter of life and death.

191
00:13:11,936 --> 00:13:15,009
All right, but am still.
My car, seven hours.

192
00:13:15,977 --> 00:13:18,411
Good. For example, the beaver hearings.

193
00:13:18,537 --> 00:13:21,369
- Thanks.
- Jimmy, the car.

194
00:13:36,938 --> 00:13:39,771
Blow out the candles and make a wish.

195
00:13:43,818 --> 00:13:45,935
- Surprise.
- Congratulations.

196
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:49,931
- You're birthday.
- A mouse in the house.

197
00:13:50,019 --> 00:13:52,169
- Specify.
- I lick the candles out.

198
00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:55,138
- Oh yeah? Kiss my fat...
- Not so greedy.

199
00:13:55,219 --> 00:13:57,608
I am so sorry.

200
00:13:57,699 --> 00:14:00,657
Beware of my Bontje.
We wanted to surprise her.

201
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:03,971
If the kitten was
had you found cute.

202
00:14:04,059 --> 00:14:08,258
- You are not cute pussy...
- Welles.

203
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,331
- . . But dirty rats...
- Nietes.

204
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:13,332
- . . Which have ruined the cake.
- Not so fake.

205
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:16,174
If you''swap''rats, ''get''star.

206
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:19,059
- I'm a star, buddy.
- Oh, yeah?

207
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:22,656
You know what you get
if you ha''swap''?

208
00:14:22,741 --> 00:14:24,140
Exactly.

209
00:14:25,381 --> 00:14:28,293
- Is this what I think?
- Nappies.

210
00:14:28,382 --> 00:14:30,373
My favorite precarious. Chocolate.

211
00:14:30,901 --> 00:14:33,734
Say''Maya''.

212
00:14:35,661 --> 00:14:39,178
- What are you doing?
- He wants to say something.

213
00:14:39,262 --> 00:14:42,095
Bring me a bone.

214
00:14:42,183 --> 00:14:45,094
And a large portion super fly.

215
00:14:45,182 --> 00:14:50,461
Bring me ham, German sausage and meat products.

216
00:14:50,543 --> 00:14:54,422
- Lucky, out.
- Can I Charisse alone speak?

217
00:14:54,503 --> 00:14:56,300
Come on, kid.

218
00:15:00,664 --> 00:15:03,462
Sorry about tonight.

219
00:15:03,544 --> 00:15:07,981
I ga bit calmer about it,
so I can be home more often.

220
00:15:08,064 --> 00:15:10,976
- Even more animals here.
- But we can go.

221
00:15:11,064 --> 00:15:14,453
Shall we all go to Europe?

222
00:15:14,544 --> 00:15:17,981
- Are you serious?
- We can go to Paris, Rome.

223
00:15:18,065 --> 00:15:21,693
We have so often talked about.
Would you like that?

224
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,456
Try me to buy?

225
00:15:26,145 --> 00:15:28,022
Yes, yes.

226
00:15:29,146 --> 00:15:32,057
- It works.
- Another thing...

227
00:15:32,146 --> 00:15:33,942
- Tomorrow.
- What?

228
00:15:34,025 --> 00:15:35,936
Tomorrow.

229
00:15:36,025 --> 00:15:38,540
On holiday to Europe. Tomorrow.

230
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:41,186
Tomorrow we go to Europe.

231
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:59,821
Doc, the raccoon and opossum were
towards this mysterious beaver.

232
00:16:00,387 --> 00:16:03,857
- Nice cart. Which one is it?
- A Mustang.

233
00:16:03,947 --> 00:16:07,906
- Is there a car to my name?
- Opossum does not exist.

234
00:16:07,987 --> 00:16:11,901
- Why not?
- They call them not to rodents.

235
00:16:17,868 --> 00:16:21,464
Just a few lines
if you meet the beaver.

236
00:16:21,548 --> 00:16:23,779
No sudden movements.

237
00:16:23,869 --> 00:16:28,420
Not to his teeth, staring.
That stabbing a bit off.

238
00:16:28,509 --> 00:16:31,546
I think he is unacceptable.

239
00:16:31,629 --> 00:16:36,339
And lest the rest:
Treat him with respect. Capisce?

240
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,990
We are talking about a beaver?

241
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:42,383
- Tootie, how you doing?
- Doctor, how is it?

242
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:46,145
Reverse.
A little more respect, animals.

243
00:16:46,229 --> 00:16:49,382
- The raccoon has met Doc.
- It is a miracle doctor.

244
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:51,426
Paulie, contact the chief.

245
00:16:54,911 --> 00:16:57,300
I ga get some acorns.

246
00:16:58,071 --> 00:17:01,949
Dr Dolittle, I presume.
Welcome to my home.

247
00:17:02,031 --> 00:17:05,546
- Would you like to fish?
- No, thank you. I've already eaten.

248
00:17:05,631 --> 00:17:08,350
If the beaver offers a fish, then eat your fish.

249
00:17:08,432 --> 00:17:10,582
- Shut up.
- Sorry, boss.

250
00:17:10,671 --> 00:17:14,221
I hear good things about you
of the families from the Bay Area.

251
00:17:14,432 --> 00:17:18,630
Families in the Bay Area?
Are you the mafia or something?

252
00:17:18,712 --> 00:17:21,749
We know nothing of the mafia.
Hey, guys?

253
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:24,027
- Never heard of it.
- Chimera.

254
00:17:24,112 --> 00:17:29,311
I am a simple fisherman who many
friends. Do you want one of them?

255
00:17:29,393 --> 00:17:33,353
- What do you want?
- I get my lost territory.

256
00:17:33,432 --> 00:17:37,186
- To other animals?
- From the human species.

257
00:17:37,273 --> 00:17:40,390
They cut our homes to
get families apart.

258
00:17:40,474 --> 00:17:44,433
- The whole forest is flat.
- Then you do not have.

259
00:17:44,514 --> 00:17:48,189
Please prefer to contact
natural associations.

260
00:17:48,274 --> 00:17:52,062
You are the only
the spoken word goes.

261
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:56,750
We humans can not
with its guns, knives, sleeping banks.

262
00:17:56,835 --> 00:18:00,714
Okay, I have rabies
and I may bite someone. But then?

263
00:18:00,795 --> 00:18:04,947
- You understand me.
- Yes. Man against nature.

264
00:18:05,034 --> 00:18:07,754
With you on our side
it is a different story.

265
00:18:07,835 --> 00:18:12,351
I have not said
I would help you.

266
00:18:12,435 --> 00:18:17,668
Before you say no, I want first
show what I am talking about.

267
00:18:41,197 --> 00:18:42,995
It is gone.

268
00:18:43,437 --> 00:18:45,826
Everything is gone.

269
00:18:51,277 --> 00:18:54,429
- How do you save a forest?
- That will not be easy.

270
00:18:54,518 --> 00:18:57,430
The timber has a big influence.

271
00:18:57,518 --> 00:19:01,831
But if there is an endangered species
In that forest lived

272
00:19:01,918 --> 00:19:06,230
- Then there was ground for protection.
- How do I get back there?

273
00:19:06,598 --> 00:19:09,989
You should be able to ask Eugene.

274
00:19:10,439 --> 00:19:14,831
There was an endangered bear species.
A motherless female.

275
00:19:14,918 --> 00:19:19,310
- She is the only western Pacific bear.
- It must be protected.

276
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:23,951
Potters Houthakkerij claims that
since it is the only one,

277
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:27,953
the species no chance.
You still need a man.

278
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:31,351
Find a man
and its natural course.

279
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,309
The only west-Pacific male
is raised in captivity.

280
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:41,031
There has never been a bear
successfully put back into the wild.

281
00:19:41,121 --> 00:19:44,751
Because they never help
the love doctor had.

282
00:19:44,841 --> 00:19:47,719
- Doctor.
- Excuse me.

283
00:19:47,801 --> 00:19:49,871
Soon his little bird flies away.

284
00:19:49,961 --> 00:19:52,317
- Is something wrong?
- The...

285
00:19:52,961 --> 00:19:55,999
Jeez. Hopefully, nothing Bambam seen.

286
00:19:56,082 --> 00:20:00,200
It was the giraffe who took offense at.

287
00:20:09,482 --> 00:20:12,872
I understand how disappointed you are.

288
00:20:12,963 --> 00:20:15,113
Because we do not go to Europe?

289
00:20:15,204 --> 00:20:19,993
- Why would I be disappointed?
- I love me to my promise.

290
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:22,392
Let me know if you do not want me to do this.

291
00:20:22,523 --> 00:20:25,640
And me the rest of my life
feel guilty, sure.

292
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:29,512
- When are we going?
- Once the court prohibits logging.

293
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,992
Who will take the case?

294
00:20:35,124 --> 00:20:37,160
- Why look around?
- Me?

295
00:20:37,245 --> 00:20:38,882
Who, me? Not me. You.

296
00:20:44,165 --> 00:20:45,962
For the animals.

297
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:49,196
- I do not animal rights.
- For the animals.

298
00:20:49,285 --> 00:20:53,073
That is kind of ism. You are a Specist.

299
00:20:53,645 --> 00:20:59,323
We ask only for an execution,
so we can save the species.

300
00:21:00,566 --> 00:21:04,241
This is time stretch c. q. a publicity stunt.

301
00:21:04,327 --> 00:21:07,841
I have statements under oath
of a number of experts

302
00:21:07,926 --> 00:21:13,637
that restore a tame bear
in the wild

303
00:21:13,727 --> 00:21:16,480
dangerous and irresponsible.

304
00:21:17,007 --> 00:21:23,116
A circus bear can no food
finding or dealing with real bears.

305
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:25,642
Let alone the winter comes.

306
00:21:25,727 --> 00:21:30,881
He would go under
to the survival laws of Darwin.

307
00:21:31,448 --> 00:21:34,520
- On...
- Darwin not know my dad.

308
00:21:34,608 --> 00:21:39,000
That is inappropriate behavior.
And who is your father then?

309
00:21:39,088 --> 00:21:42,364
That's me, Your Honor.
I am Dolittle.

310
00:21:46,408 --> 00:21:52,199
Can you tame a bear in the wild off
and to mate with that female?

311
00:21:52,289 --> 00:21:53,688
Absolutely.

312
00:21:53,768 --> 00:21:58,286
In that case I give one month delay
on the hood of Campbell's Grove.

313
00:21:58,369 --> 00:22:02,488
- One month ahead. Nothing more.
- Thank you.

314
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:09,248
And if the bear but a claw
on a campsite or in this city move

315
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:11,799
I then pull the order in subiet.

316
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:14,246
I understand. Thank you.

317
00:22:14,371 --> 00:22:16,247
Thank you, Your Honor.

318
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:18,881
Dr Dolittle, this way.

319
00:22:18,971 --> 00:22:22,327
You talk with domestic and wild animals.

320
00:22:22,411 --> 00:22:25,130
Are a circus bear and forest beer together?

321
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:28,487
He has long been in captivity.

322
00:22:28,572 --> 00:22:32,087
So he will be happy
to return to nature.

323
00:22:37,692 --> 00:22:42,447
Road vacation with the family.
Doc thought:''This is a cinch. ''

324
00:22:42,532 --> 00:22:45,046
But when he had not yet met Archie.

325
00:22:47,012 --> 00:22:52,291
Ladies and gentlemen, he is a bear
of a gentleman, the talking fire rug:

326
00:22:52,373 --> 00:22:53,772
Archie the bear.

327
00:22:59,573 --> 00:23:00,847
They game me.

328
00:23:06,734 --> 00:23:09,884
Archie. And the show is over.

329
00:23:12,614 --> 00:23:14,605
Good girl, huh?

330
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:18,726
- A bit of it.
- Have you no action photos?

331
00:23:18,815 --> 00:23:22,011
No, but you're a lucky man
if you hook it to the stores.

332
00:23:22,095 --> 00:23:26,088
Girls Saturday I got to each finger ten.

333
00:23:26,175 --> 00:23:31,533
Okay, I've never had a girlfriend,
but bring her Monday visit.

334
00:23:31,615 --> 00:23:34,083
You can not. You have to go to her.

335
00:23:34,175 --> 00:23:37,373
- Back to her? Where?
- She is in the forest.

336
00:23:38,576 --> 00:23:42,535
I do not forests.
I am a beer for celebrations and parties.

337
00:23:42,617 --> 00:23:46,165
- You know what kind of beer you are?
- Once thought.

338
00:23:46,256 --> 00:23:51,377
- A singer and dancer. Three years draft.
- You are an endangered species.

339
00:23:51,456 --> 00:23:54,653
Start a threat?
My lawyer picked you...

340
00:23:54,737 --> 00:23:59,173
I just want to say
that you are a rare Pacific beer.

341
00:23:59,257 --> 00:24:00,849
You know what that is?

342
00:24:00,938 --> 00:24:05,090
I do each bear. I do grizzly, panda, polar bear.
Look:

343
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:08,772
- ''I am freezing. What a cold. ''
- I will say it clearer.

344
00:24:08,858 --> 00:24:12,008
Your ancestors came from California.

345
00:24:12,098 --> 00:24:17,775
Humans have you removed
and learned to''Hound Dog''to swing.

346
00:24:17,859 --> 00:24:19,770
That I have learned.

347
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:24,693
I grease a little syrup to the people,
but that is not miraculously?

348
00:24:24,778 --> 00:24:26,928
Very nice, Archie.

349
00:24:27,019 --> 00:24:31,888
But I want you back
to the country of your ancestors

350
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,971
and you learn to be a real bear.

351
00:24:34,059 --> 00:24:37,530
I am satisfied with the bear I am.
I'm famous.

352
00:24:37,619 --> 00:24:40,692
There is even a Beanie Baby from me for sale.

353
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:44,330
If you do, you
the most famous beer in the world.

354
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:46,411
- More famous than Pooh?
- What did you think?

355
00:24:46,501 --> 00:24:49,890
If it succeeds, everybody says''Winnie the Who?''

356
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,732
This bear does it.

357
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:55,616
And now one of the strangest posts
of the year.

358
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:59,295
Dr Dolittle duplicate any nature to his boot.

359
00:24:59,381 --> 00:25:03,056
He is a circus bear in the wild to restore

360
00:25:03,141 --> 00:25:07,100
so a forest
logging for the future.

361
00:25:07,182 --> 00:25:10,890
- It is contra Darwin Dolittle.
- Shut up.

362
00:25:10,982 --> 00:25:14,815
I have two sawmills
at that wood waiting.

363
00:25:14,902 --> 00:25:20,340
I understand, but it is difficult.
Especially if the bear survive.

364
00:25:20,662 --> 00:25:26,180
If I get my quota,
I do not know whether you survive.

365
00:25:26,262 --> 00:25:30,097
That ridiculous beer
is definitely on the writing.

366
00:25:30,182 --> 00:25:33,654
If that happens, you have a trophy to.

367
00:25:33,742 --> 00:25:36,258
I have a spot for him.

368
00:26:02,705 --> 00:26:06,539
We moved into the forest
and waiting for Archie.

369
00:26:06,625 --> 00:26:11,336
While it turns out,
I went the dog just exhausts.

370
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:16,459
This seems an ideal spot.

371
00:26:17,306 --> 00:26:19,456
The simple pleasures of life.

372
00:26:19,546 --> 00:26:22,777
Good grace. What a piece of that wolf.

373
00:26:24,826 --> 00:26:28,136
I hope I do not stink out of my mouth
van 't to lick my...

374
00:26:28,226 --> 00:26:30,342
Beautiful, huh? Yes, I am.

375
00:26:30,427 --> 00:26:32,986
I have much more of that stuff.

376
00:26:34,547 --> 00:26:36,025
From the same.

377
00:26:36,107 --> 00:26:40,578
What is that?
''I like you''in the wild-teefs?

378
00:26:41,107 --> 00:26:44,656
I do to breakdance.
This is the ruggenkrabber.

379
00:26:44,747 --> 00:26:46,738
Not too bad, huh?

380
00:26:46,827 --> 00:26:50,867
Ladies Dog not leave.
Will you call me?

381
00:26:51,308 --> 00:26:53,424
The big day had arrived.

382
00:26:53,508 --> 00:26:56,386
Now we had the bears to dance.

383
00:26:56,469 --> 00:27:02,021
You know why we are here.
We will just do what has never been done.

384
00:27:02,108 --> 00:27:07,183
They think that it is not possible.
Their trucks are already ready.

385
00:27:07,269 --> 00:27:09,578
But we will prove the contrary.

386
00:27:09,908 --> 00:27:13,743
Equally the claw gently together.

387
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:17,265
Applause for the bear
take the lead.

388
00:27:17,349 --> 00:27:20,261
Here's Archie.

389
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,823
Come on.

390
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:27,621
Who wants to save the forest here?

391
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:31,750
Legs in the air.
Come on, do it.

392
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:33,707
You gotta be kidding me.

393
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:38,467
Now even the serious side of the track.
I know it will be heavy.

394
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:41,111
But with your help...

395
00:28:00,392 --> 00:28:02,383
All of them.

396
00:28:03,952 --> 00:28:06,513
- We have been there.
- Never in his life.

397
00:28:06,593 --> 00:28:09,186
- It's over.
- Come, under the wool.

398
00:28:09,273 --> 00:28:13,744
- This is a job, Doc.
- Past. Turn it off.

399
00:28:15,473 --> 00:28:17,862
You are Wayne Newton in a berenpak.

400
00:28:17,953 --> 00:28:19,989
What is it nasty.

401
00:28:20,074 --> 00:28:23,032
That you have in the forest. There is sand.

402
00:28:23,114 --> 00:28:27,630
- Wait. Is she? What a piece.
- Yes, that's it.

403
00:28:27,714 --> 00:28:30,990
Look how she moves.
That I do not see wet.

404
00:28:31,514 --> 00:28:35,302
I will up its proposals.
Wait here.

405
00:28:36,474 --> 00:28:39,353
Say that I fall on its pin,
but keep it clean.

406
00:28:39,435 --> 00:28:42,393
I will see if I can drop.

407
00:28:42,475 --> 00:28:45,114
Wait.

408
00:28:46,115 --> 00:28:48,993
If you come here?
I am the foraging.

409
00:28:49,075 --> 00:28:52,751
- Hello, I'm John.
- I'm Ava.

410
00:28:52,835 --> 00:28:55,395
What a beautiful name. Nice.

411
00:28:55,476 --> 00:28:57,467
- Hi.
- Just a question.

412
00:28:57,555 --> 00:29:00,514
Would you the man of your dreams
want to meet?

413
00:29:00,595 --> 00:29:05,386
You're a baby,
but I do not cross with other species.

414
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:08,229
I had no man should say,
but beer.

415
00:29:08,316 --> 00:29:11,036
What do you think of that splatter there?

416
00:29:12,316 --> 00:29:14,433
I see him.

417
00:29:14,876 --> 00:29:17,994
- Is he the loser?
- No, it is...

418
00:29:18,077 --> 00:29:22,912
I will explain.
They go the whole forest fell.

419
00:29:22,998 --> 00:29:27,788
The only thing they hold, as I
two Pacific bears can attach.

420
00:29:27,877 --> 00:29:34,670
You are a Pacific beer, just like him.
If you are baby bears, then...

421
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:38,273
- Understand what I want?
- I 'm not talking bears pimps.

422
00:29:38,358 --> 00:29:42,192
Let me call him.
Archie, come here.

423
00:29:42,558 --> 00:29:47,188
Oh, there you are. I had thought that we
perhaps even could be sports.

424
00:29:48,959 --> 00:29:51,393
- Your turn.
- What should I say?

425
00:29:51,479 --> 00:29:56,314
- Tell her about yourself.
- I'm Archie.

426
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:01,314
I love walking in the moonlight,
lebberen enter with a special someone

427
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,960
and the sultry sound of the Backstreet Boys.

428
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:07,153
- You're weird.
- Are you crazy sexy?

429
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:08,959
No, just weird.

430
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:14,235
- I take it just about. Good.
- Damn.

431
00:30:14,321 --> 00:30:17,472
What do you think of Archie? Is not the baby?

432
00:30:17,561 --> 00:30:19,757
But only that I can not eat.

433
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,594
He is not his comfort with a female there.

434
00:30:22,681 --> 00:30:25,639
This is not the point. I want a real beer.

435
00:30:25,721 --> 00:30:29,112
One that can hunt and for me to worry.

436
00:30:29,201 --> 00:30:32,796
- That is understandable.
- And I already have someone.

437
00:30:32,882 --> 00:30:35,635
Do you have a boyfriend? Bears a boyfriend?

438
00:30:35,721 --> 00:30:39,112
- Are you in love with him?
- My cousin married out of love.

439
00:30:39,202 --> 00:30:43,401
But they knew
He deceived her with a grizzly'tje.

440
00:30:43,482 --> 00:30:45,074
So you're not in love.

441
00:30:45,162 --> 00:30:49,633
Let us agree on what.
Do not rush for a month.

442
00:30:49,723 --> 00:30:54,319
Then I make at the time of Archie
a bear cub that you can get.

443
00:30:54,483 --> 00:30:56,633
I role in the fabric for you.

444
00:30:56,724 --> 00:30:58,715
Dennenappel.

445
00:31:11,485 --> 00:31:13,281
Perfect evening.

446
00:31:13,364 --> 00:31:17,278
Beautiful in the fresh air,
listen to the crickets.

447
00:31:19,285 --> 00:31:21,354
You know what they say?

448
00:31:21,445 --> 00:31:24,881
No idea. You are the person
which the animals talk.

449
00:31:24,965 --> 00:31:29,243
Monkeys do not ask me to drink.
I am not saying: 'What is it, beast?

450
00:31:29,325 --> 00:31:32,124
I listen to music.
I ever talk with animals?

451
00:31:32,205 --> 00:31:36,996
I just wanted to say that crickets
the thermometers of nature.

452
00:31:37,086 --> 00:31:39,679
The colder it is, the faster they tsjirpen.

453
00:31:45,366 --> 00:31:49,279
- It's quite cold tonight, huh?
- A little fresh.

454
00:31:49,527 --> 00:31:51,994
Ga I think I get my vest.

455
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:10,163
Yo, Dr. Dre and Snoop.

456
00:32:12,208 --> 00:32:14,597
And let that car checked, man.

457
00:32:15,168 --> 00:32:17,840
Yo, how you doing, baby?

458
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:24,157
- You forget your buddy.
- How you doing, Dr. D?

459
00:32:24,249 --> 00:32:26,479
I know a lot. You tell me.

460
00:32:26,568 --> 00:32:31,597
I thought, I go along. You may
m so happy, so I'll stay.

461
00:32:31,689 --> 00:32:34,249
Nothing it.
I do not.

462
00:32:34,329 --> 00:32:37,401
- What do not you, Dad?
- Eric in bags.

463
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:41,847
- He will stay. It was Mom.
- It was your mother.

464
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:45,605
You sleep on the floor
in the living room, in your sleeping bag.

465
00:32:45,689 --> 00:32:50,047
If you do not mind.
And I love you.

466
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:53,203
And the whole forest, too.
I talk to the birds.

467
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:55,879
- Thanks, Dad.
- So beware.

468
00:32:55,971 --> 00:32:59,600
- I get it.
- Yes, you drum? Good.

469
00:32:59,971 --> 00:33:03,441
I have you in mind, though.

470
00:33:03,771 --> 00:33:07,320
Bears are opportunists. They eat everything.

471
00:33:07,411 --> 00:33:10,926
- Is there anything else on?
- Nothing of it.

472
00:33:11,011 --> 00:33:15,528
You should look at
to learn how to survive the winter.

473
00:33:15,611 --> 00:33:17,443
Is he digging?

474
00:33:17,531 --> 00:33:21,730
Have you ever wondered
why you have claws?

475
00:33:21,812 --> 00:33:25,283
- Bears can swim excellent.
- Not this one.

476
00:33:25,372 --> 00:33:27,488
Can not you swim?

477
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:31,407
Have you never heard of boats?

478
00:33:31,492 --> 00:33:35,725
That is the door. We are
early and then I'll learn to fish.

479
00:33:35,814 --> 00:33:37,724
- Around noon?
- Unbelievable.

480
00:33:37,813 --> 00:33:43,127
So began the calculation Thon, a bear
of a job, just brutal.

481
00:33:43,213 --> 00:33:44,202
Enough.

482
00:33:44,294 --> 00:33:48,526
- In this river is bursting with fish.
- At the viskraam too.

483
00:33:48,613 --> 00:33:54,133
- Not to me, rather than to the water.
- They move. One has just touched me.

484
00:33:54,214 --> 00:33:57,730
Not so childish.
Head in the water and fish.

485
00:33:57,855 --> 00:34:00,892
- No.
- As you have seen on TV.

486
00:34:00,975 --> 00:34:05,969
Head under water and a fish bite.
You can do it best. I stay with you.

487
00:34:06,055 --> 00:34:08,410
I will try.

488
00:34:12,776 --> 00:34:14,846
- There is Archie.
- How you doing?

489
00:34:14,936 --> 00:34:16,733
How you doing?

490
00:34:19,176 --> 00:34:20,928
Grab one.

491
00:34:36,417 --> 00:34:41,093
Who forgets that now his head out of the water
to achieve if he can not breathe?

492
00:34:41,177 --> 00:34:44,725
I saw a bright light. It was beautiful.

493
00:34:44,937 --> 00:34:49,090
Enough. We will make you hard sometimes.

494
00:34:49,178 --> 00:34:53,217
- We started something that even you handle it.
- I saw my opoe.

495
00:34:57,938 --> 00:34:59,611
Come on, eat.

496
00:34:59,698 --> 00:35:03,578
- Go, eat.
- I do not eat... I do nothing.

497
00:35:05,579 --> 00:35:08,615
- Am I already in the neighborhood?
- Cold.

498
00:35:08,699 --> 00:35:10,849
Use the Force.

499
00:35:10,979 --> 00:35:14,096
- Colder? Warmer?
- You freezes.

500
00:35:14,459 --> 00:35:18,419
- How are you?
- It's crazy. Three weeks is enough.

501
00:35:18,499 --> 00:35:20,570
He looks as grapes.

502
00:35:20,659 --> 00:35:24,699
- Why is he gone?
- He runs around.

503
00:35:24,939 --> 00:35:29,491
- Why? Are they dangerous?
- No, they are not dangerous.

504
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:33,937
- Where are the grapes then?
- We are exactly on schedule.

505
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,940
I'm dizzy.

506
00:35:39,661 --> 00:35:45,019
Do not panic. The concrete has
my fall broken. Bruise.

507
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:51,098
Put another out. I have six months
in a close black hole sleep?

508
00:35:51,342 --> 00:35:55,540
- That do bears. The winter.
- Sounds more like a depression.

509
00:35:55,622 --> 00:35:57,533
- How should I eat?
- You do not eat.

510
00:35:57,621 --> 00:36:01,410
You eat the summer enough
the winter to come.

511
00:36:01,502 --> 00:36:04,972
- And the bathroom?
- That you do not.

512
00:36:05,063 --> 00:36:06,860
You are kidding.

513
00:36:06,942 --> 00:36:13,815
A week before you go hibernate,
eat your sand, moss, hair and grass.

514
00:36:13,902 --> 00:36:19,820
This is a plug in your...
It stops you... You know.

515
00:36:19,903 --> 00:36:22,701
- It blocks my hole?
- Exactly.

516
00:36:22,783 --> 00:36:28,063
With a big fat plug
of hair and grass. Big fat plug.

517
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:29,782
Ho minute.

518
00:36:29,864 --> 00:36:33,857
I sleep half years with a cork in my hole?

519
00:36:34,385 --> 00:36:37,262
- A bit of it.
- Yes, bye.

520
00:36:37,345 --> 00:36:41,623
- Come back.
- I go by. Bye.

521
00:36:41,705 --> 00:36:44,902
- Going south?
- Nobody picked up on a bear.

522
00:36:44,984 --> 00:36:47,818
I pay the petrol and fun children.

523
00:36:47,906 --> 00:36:51,102
- Come on, Archie.
- Sorry. It is nothing.

524
00:36:51,185 --> 00:36:54,064
I almost drowned. Ava likes me not.

525
00:36:54,145 --> 00:36:59,139
I lament that you tired.
Look in the tree. What do you see?

526
00:36:59,466 --> 00:37:01,775
- Bird.
- A bird in his house.

527
00:37:01,867 --> 00:37:06,542
That branch is a squirrel in his house.
There is a rabbit in his house.

528
00:37:06,627 --> 00:37:11,825
These animals need you.
So let the inner bear loose.

529
00:37:11,906 --> 00:37:15,297
Trust him.
He says do what you gotta do.

530
00:37:15,387 --> 00:37:19,346
My inner bear has trouble
with that ass cork.

531
00:37:19,426 --> 00:37:23,579
I will show you animals
not home anymore.

532
00:37:31,108 --> 00:37:33,099
Hello, Clarice.

533
00:37:34,988 --> 00:37:39,266
- This really does not.
- Sometimes a hard approach is best.

534
00:37:39,348 --> 00:37:43,387
What is it, kid?
Could you live outside not?

535
00:37:43,908 --> 00:37:46,139
Come on in, pussy.

536
00:37:46,229 --> 00:37:48,789
- Inside.
- Why?

537
00:37:48,868 --> 00:37:51,463
Go talk to that bear.

538
00:37:51,549 --> 00:37:54,426
Ga I just sit there.

539
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:58,103
- I'm tired.
- Do not be afraid.

540
00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:01,101
- I bite you.
- Dolittle. Hello, dear.

541
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:06,264
Keep your not hunt or fish?
You know how much I would be in the woods?

542
00:38:07,829 --> 00:38:10,788
Did anyone what?

543
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:15,546
That is the problem with the youth
today. No respect.

544
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:18,987
We should teach him a lesson.

545
00:38:19,071 --> 00:38:22,188
I take it in the bear grip.
Come here, uk.

546
00:38:22,271 --> 00:38:27,550
It is fine.
I finally got it under control.

547
00:38:31,671 --> 00:38:33,866
Can I call back?

548
00:38:38,952 --> 00:38:42,184
These folks here love musicals.

549
00:38:42,272 --> 00:38:44,548
Just kidding. I better do my best.

550
00:38:44,912 --> 00:38:50,146
If the cat house, the dancing mice.
I mean teenagers.

551
00:38:50,233 --> 00:38:52,952
- Do your eyes closed?
- Here they come.

552
00:38:54,153 --> 00:38:57,747
- Have you done this?
- You know what Doc said.

553
00:38:57,833 --> 00:39:00,507
If he means to be affected, we deal with him.

554
00:39:00,593 --> 00:39:05,987
- There are wings, drumsticks, taco's.
- Did anyone''''taco?

555
00:39:06,074 --> 00:39:09,464
Change color. You betrayed us.

556
00:39:09,673 --> 00:39:13,429
There is something I have
a long time I want to do.

557
00:39:13,514 --> 00:39:15,948
What then?

558
00:39:16,355 --> 00:39:17,583
This.

559
00:39:20,914 --> 00:39:22,063
Now.

560
00:39:23,315 --> 00:39:25,306
He told me getongd.

561
00:39:26,195 --> 00:39:29,982
That went well. I treat you, Jenny.

562
00:39:30,515 --> 00:39:34,111
Meanwhile, Archie and I were taught by Doc.

563
00:39:34,555 --> 00:39:37,945
Leave some for me. It is my...

564
00:39:38,435 --> 00:39:41,985
- It was just an idea.
- What is going on?

565
00:39:42,077 --> 00:39:45,273
I must be back for the ladies dog.

566
00:39:45,356 --> 00:39:48,905
That you do not have to pick up. Get out.

567
00:39:48,996 --> 00:39:51,830
- What a whopper.
- What do you have?

568
00:39:51,917 --> 00:39:54,306
Any female looking for the strongest man.

569
00:39:54,397 --> 00:39:57,548
- Is not love nature?
- I remain a virgin.

570
00:39:57,637 --> 00:40:02,233
Listen. The strongest man
hot alpha male. He is the boss.

571
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:06,469
You should be.
The boss of all males.

572
00:40:06,558 --> 00:40:09,789
You must run as an alpha male.

573
00:40:10,318 --> 00:40:12,309
Loop it for sale.

574
00:40:12,397 --> 00:40:15,834
- And speaking as it should.
- I still walk.

575
00:40:15,918 --> 00:40:17,590
It is about power and respect.

576
00:40:17,678 --> 00:40:22,707
Pure, onbeknotte by testosterone
driven, male power.

577
00:40:22,798 --> 00:40:27,747
- You should change the bin liners.
- Do it yourself, bitch.

578
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:30,511
- What?
- I was talking to the animals.

579
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:36,197
- I had something to tell.
- Keep it up and go eat out.

580
00:40:36,279 --> 00:40:38,430
I'm gone, baby.

581
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:39,919
- Now.
- I ga al

582
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,355
- Well, say.
- Shut up.

583
00:40:42,439 --> 00:40:46,399
- Who should be close to his head?
- I was talking to the animals.

584
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,471
I eat out.

585
00:40:53,761 --> 00:40:57,436
- You no longer?
- No, thank you.

586
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:05,390
Suppose your whole life in show continues.

587
00:41:05,481 --> 00:41:08,359
What is your grand finale?

588
00:41:08,441 --> 00:41:11,558
Finale? Headline in the San Francisco Bee:

589
00:41:11,642 --> 00:41:14,713
''The best number to Archies
after the final. ''

590
00:41:14,802 --> 00:41:18,192
I mean in life.
With whom you share your success?

591
00:41:18,281 --> 00:41:20,477
Your hope, your dreams, your fears.

592
00:41:20,642 --> 00:41:25,272
What I do mean nothing
without my wife and children.

593
00:41:25,363 --> 00:41:29,241
I am lonely.
I have never been in love.

594
00:41:29,323 --> 00:41:32,156
This is your chance. Ava, you can expect.

595
00:41:32,242 --> 00:41:34,552
Did she say anything? What then?

596
00:41:34,643 --> 00:41:37,715
You may have a good understand others.

597
00:41:37,803 --> 00:41:42,194
- Does she love me? I said it.
- Not immediately exaggerate.

598
00:41:42,284 --> 00:41:47,278
I feel like I'm apart ga blows.
Do it for love too?

599
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:50,352
Or are the marshmallows?

600
00:41:51,885 --> 00:41:54,522
You've eaten a whole bag is empty.

601
00:41:54,604 --> 00:41:57,597
Tomorrow you will see a whole new beer.

602
00:41:57,684 --> 00:42:00,040
I think I just go to sleep.

603
00:42:00,125 --> 00:42:06,314
Do not leave. I think this is a bit scary.
Stay with me until I sleep?

604
00:42:08,965 --> 00:42:11,479
I wait until you are asleep.

605
00:42:13,366 --> 00:42:18,759
- Can you leave the light on?
- Good.

606
00:42:19,845 --> 00:42:22,041
I love it here. Good?

607
00:42:25,606 --> 00:42:27,837
Good night.

608
00:42:27,966 --> 00:42:31,164
Give me a holler
if you want a marshmallow.

609
00:42:37,167 --> 00:42:40,604
Attention, Ava.
Here is the all-new Archie.

610
00:42:43,768 --> 00:42:46,076
That feels good.

611
00:42:47,287 --> 00:42:49,279
Can you feel it?

612
00:42:49,968 --> 00:42:51,959
Feel the pain.

613
00:42:52,687 --> 00:42:54,883
Feel the wind.

614
00:42:54,969 --> 00:42:57,038
Feel the cramps.

615
00:43:01,129 --> 00:43:03,403
Come on. Not give up.

616
00:43:03,648 --> 00:43:07,358
I Ol, slit my glutes.
My butt hurts.

617
00:43:07,448 --> 00:43:10,247
Will you massage my ass?

618
00:43:10,329 --> 00:43:13,526
Rub my butt on. Please?

619
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:22,278
Doc realized that Archie not easily
Or was strong enough for Ava.

620
00:43:22,369 --> 00:43:25,486
But perhaps sweet enough.

621
00:43:26,889 --> 00:43:32,011
- That someone so beautiful can be...
- Why did not you tell?

622
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:34,524
I do not know.

623
00:43:34,611 --> 00:43:36,010
What is that?

624
00:43:36,090 --> 00:43:39,605
This is Sonny, her boyfriend.
She told me about him.

625
00:43:39,691 --> 00:43:44,810
- But that is a Kodiak bear.
- Do not be discouraged.

626
00:43:44,891 --> 00:43:48,406
For a woman to tempt
you must find out what they like.

627
00:43:48,491 --> 00:43:52,087
- Take my wife.
- No, thank you.

628
00:43:52,172 --> 00:43:56,165
- She likes surprises.
- If you screaming from the bushes jumps?

629
00:43:56,252 --> 00:43:58,368
No, they like romance.

630
00:43:58,452 --> 00:44:02,810
Just what they mean
you always think they are.

631
00:44:02,892 --> 00:44:06,248
Fun, say. And do it all the time?

632
00:44:06,453 --> 00:44:08,648
Previously it.

633
00:44:08,733 --> 00:44:14,729
But lately I have this rather
pressure and is there made the shot.

634
00:44:19,374 --> 00:44:22,332
Candles, fruit, cheese, wine. Perfect.

635
00:44:25,213 --> 00:44:28,206
- What are you doing?
- Hey, baby.

636
00:44:28,294 --> 00:44:31,331
Tonight I heart you.

637
00:44:31,574 --> 00:44:36,045
The children are to the cinema,
the bear is in the forest.

638
00:44:36,134 --> 00:44:39,684
- We are alone.
- All alone.

639
00:44:39,775 --> 00:44:42,209
- Excuse me.
- You can not see me.

640
00:44:42,295 --> 00:44:48,165
I am one with the bank.
I ga coating on each filament. I...

641
00:44:48,256 --> 00:44:51,214
We are not disturbed.

642
00:44:51,295 --> 00:44:54,128
There is nothing like your buddies can see nothing.

643
00:44:54,296 --> 00:44:55,570
Where were we?

644
00:44:55,656 --> 00:44:59,968
You thought you could compensate
that you have neglected me.

645
00:45:00,055 --> 00:45:02,934
I feel resistance. As I had anticipated.

646
00:45:03,016 --> 00:45:05,610
So I just irresistible bass.

647
00:45:09,816 --> 00:45:12,376
- Is this our wedding song?
- Not fair.

648
00:45:12,457 --> 00:45:15,051
The number where you
as Mrs Dolittle on dancing.

649
00:45:15,137 --> 00:45:18,652
- The show will begin.
- Which show?

650
00:45:18,737 --> 00:45:21,410
That is the real.

651
00:45:21,498 --> 00:45:23,965
Really

652
00:45:24,058 --> 00:45:28,654
I'm really in love with Mrs Dolittle

653
00:45:33,819 --> 00:45:36,013
What is he good.

654
00:45:36,218 --> 00:45:41,053
He scratched last on my belly
and my leg was like a raging at once.

655
00:45:43,099 --> 00:45:47,297
- What happens here?
- He is really in love with her.

656
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:51,169
Give her some garbage.
There are the girls like.

657
00:45:51,619 --> 00:45:54,816
If Dr D something sweet on his lips?

658
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:57,049
That is very possible.

659
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:00,615
Ga it, Doc.

660
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:03,331
He has broken.

661
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:06,374
Get out. All of them.

662
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:10,089
- This is not a peepshow.
- But here I learn.

663
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:13,014
- Really.
- We have it on tomorrow.

664
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:16,218
- Packed.
- What are you talking about tomorrow?

665
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:18,291
I was just...

666
00:46:19,101 --> 00:46:22,810
Honey, where were we again go?

667
00:46:22,901 --> 00:46:24,300
Honey...

668
00:46:24,381 --> 00:46:26,577
But you sleep on the couch.

669
00:46:29,621 --> 00:46:31,977
What did she say?

670
00:46:32,062 --> 00:46:34,940
She loves me so much
I can sleep on the couch.

671
00:46:35,222 --> 00:46:37,258
What a guy.

672
00:46:37,342 --> 00:46:38,979
Yes, what a guy.

673
00:46:39,062 --> 00:46:41,053
The guy on the bench.

674
00:46:57,103 --> 00:47:00,459
Romeo is in motion.
His hormones effervescence.

675
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:04,135
There we go.

676
00:47:04,784 --> 00:47:06,615
Halt.

677
00:47:06,704 --> 00:47:08,695
I wish only the toilet.

678
00:47:10,023 --> 00:47:12,412
Keep it up. I know that trick.

679
00:47:14,584 --> 00:47:18,293
- Hey, baby.
- What is your vote?

680
00:47:18,465 --> 00:47:20,057
You look good.

681
00:47:20,145 --> 00:47:25,219
I might get something sweet in my...
Will Archie...

682
00:47:25,306 --> 00:47:28,536
really

683
00:47:28,706 --> 00:47:30,901
No, huh.

684
00:47:31,105 --> 00:47:32,778
Is that our number?

685
00:47:36,786 --> 00:47:38,901
Hard ground. Back.

686
00:47:38,986 --> 00:47:41,784
You must learn climbing trees. Really.

687
00:47:41,866 --> 00:47:43,777
Yet another bruise.

688
00:47:44,466 --> 00:47:46,741
- Come out, Archie.
- Never.

689
00:47:46,826 --> 00:47:50,739
- So much was it not?
- I have never been geschaamd.

690
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:54,376
And I got in a tutu
on a unicycle driven.

691
00:47:54,467 --> 00:47:59,700
- We can do what to do.
- I start now my hibernation.

692
00:47:59,787 --> 00:48:02,859
- We make myself a berenpak.
- It is not good.

693
00:48:03,027 --> 00:48:08,260
Good, because otherwise all animals
next week you stay.

694
00:48:08,428 --> 00:48:12,580
No more games.
Externally, large coward.

695
00:48:12,669 --> 00:48:15,182
Who do you call a coward?

696
00:48:16,548 --> 00:48:19,858
Jou. You are a coward,
because you have the courage up.

697
00:48:20,029 --> 00:48:22,179
- It is so difficult.
- Difficult?

698
00:48:22,268 --> 00:48:24,624
My wife and daughter are mad at me

699
00:48:24,709 --> 00:48:29,022
and I leave with a four pizza farm
who always says: Yo Dr D, how you doing?

700
00:48:29,108 --> 00:48:33,261
And now I have a hairy crybaby
listening, which is difficult.

701
00:48:33,349 --> 00:48:35,863
Ava laughed me off.

702
00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:40,588
I love her, but she laughed me off.

703
00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:44,299
You should not Ava.
What do they like you a coward?

704
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:47,302
- A beer you should not jog.
- Which bear?

705
00:48:47,390 --> 00:48:51,703
If I have a real bear porde,
he would tear me.

706
00:48:51,791 --> 00:48:53,826
- I warn you.
- And I por you.

707
00:48:53,911 --> 00:48:55,389
- Stop it.
- Por, por.

708
00:48:55,471 --> 00:48:57,189
It is enough.

709
00:49:00,911 --> 00:49:03,027
That hurt.

710
00:49:03,791 --> 00:49:06,021
That felt good. Really like beer.

711
00:49:06,432 --> 00:49:09,742
I can not help.
Fuck it to your circus.

712
00:49:09,832 --> 00:49:12,027
A bear?

713
00:49:12,111 --> 00:49:13,784
I am a bear.

714
00:49:13,871 --> 00:49:16,101
I am the alpha bear.

715
00:49:18,792 --> 00:49:20,783
Bears do it''''grr?

716
00:49:23,113 --> 00:49:25,421
What happened to you?

717
00:49:29,233 --> 00:49:32,349
Potter called. He has a proposal.

718
00:49:32,833 --> 00:49:35,063
Listening does not hurt.

719
00:49:50,874 --> 00:49:53,753
- For you, madame.
- Thanks.

720
00:49:53,834 --> 00:49:57,622
- Does Sonny you fish?
- Mostly a hundred.

721
00:49:57,715 --> 00:50:01,104
Hundreds? So much he can not bear.

722
00:50:01,195 --> 00:50:05,507
But he says sometimes
You the most beautiful eyes in the world have?

723
00:50:05,594 --> 00:50:09,110
He promises you a life
full of love, fun and poetry?

724
00:50:10,115 --> 00:50:13,711
Usually he asks when I am drafty.

725
00:50:13,795 --> 00:50:16,469
What a charmer.

726
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:18,194
Where is it?

727
00:50:19,836 --> 00:50:22,589
- Would you like to walk?
- With you or alone?

728
00:50:22,676 --> 00:50:24,633
- I.
- Fine.

729
00:50:27,397 --> 00:50:31,150
This is not walking but running.
Why should we run?

730
00:51:01,039 --> 00:51:02,836
There was love in the air.

731
00:51:03,318 --> 00:51:06,436
Be a man. Be a man.

732
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:13,912
Listen here.
Yes, you. This is my house.

733
00:51:14,479 --> 00:51:16,470
Yes, my house.

734
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:20,434
My house. These are all my houses.

735
00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:26,550
You're a lucky man, you know?
You 're lucky. Not me.

736
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:29,917
- Would you like me steps?
- Excuse me.

737
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,356
- What are you doing?
- Me? I do nothing.

738
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:36,114
I go in the correct position.

739
00:51:37,921 --> 00:51:41,038
- You marked my tree.
- No.

740
00:51:41,121 --> 00:51:44,114
I would never do. I do not even know how.

741
00:51:44,201 --> 00:51:47,910
I had plenty of water for drinking. Then I have that.

742
00:51:48,002 --> 00:51:52,314
- It smells like lemonade.
- There's a good point.

743
00:51:52,401 --> 00:51:56,111
Those of you is strong. Net ammonia.

744
00:51:56,202 --> 00:51:59,080
I am even dizzy from.

745
00:51:59,162 --> 00:52:01,358
Come on, let go by.

746
00:52:01,441 --> 00:52:06,563
Are you? Have fun.
You are a nice set together.

747
00:52:06,642 --> 00:52:08,837
What do I hate myself.

748
00:52:13,683 --> 00:52:18,598
- Bears for that basket died.
- Say it if you want.

749
00:52:18,683 --> 00:52:22,518
- There is nothing in.
- I get it for you.

750
00:52:22,764 --> 00:52:25,800
I mean it. That is too dangerous.

751
00:52:25,884 --> 00:52:28,114
Promise you?

752
00:52:28,204 --> 00:52:31,992
- I like you, Ava.
- I think you also fun.

753
00:52:33,684 --> 00:52:36,358
- What are you doing, girls?
- No, Sonny.

754
00:52:36,445 --> 00:52:39,243
Get out, circus clown.

755
00:52:39,324 --> 00:52:43,398
- And you keep your mouth.
- You charm surpasses almost your perfume.

756
00:52:43,485 --> 00:52:47,273
- And what does that mean?
- You are a malodorous nitwit.

757
00:52:47,366 --> 00:52:51,564
What does he do? I do not
and love I do not like.

758
00:52:51,645 --> 00:52:55,160
- That is true.
- Is he there or not used?

759
00:52:55,245 --> 00:52:58,556
- Come. He wants me in daze.
- Do not leave.

760
00:52:58,645 --> 00:53:02,241
I'm not ten, but not with those ga zero.
You found me anyway?

761
00:53:02,326 --> 00:53:07,639
Yes, but you are a city of beer
and I do not have enough.

762
00:53:08,287 --> 00:53:11,085
City Beer. Fine.

763
00:53:17,567 --> 00:53:20,764
- Shall we play cards?
- Sure.

764
00:53:22,127 --> 00:53:27,838
This beer is as much chance
for baby bears for as Riley.

765
00:53:27,927 --> 00:53:29,327
It is not.

766
00:53:29,408 --> 00:53:33,481
But thanks to you I not baad
in the favorable publicity.

767
00:53:33,568 --> 00:53:35,957
This is my proposal.

768
00:53:36,048 --> 00:53:43,000
I leave four acres off
as a reserve for your animal friends.

769
00:53:43,088 --> 00:53:48,084
No one comes to know
you have failed, so you will not.

770
00:53:49,249 --> 00:53:52,958
- Four acres is ridiculous.
- That's my offer.

771
00:53:53,050 --> 00:53:55,244
The deadline is Wednesday at 12 pm.

772
00:53:55,329 --> 00:54:00,199
To send us a twelve
lumberjacks and all our machines.

773
00:54:00,290 --> 00:54:03,646
And Friday is no more tree.

774
00:54:06,170 --> 00:54:10,561
- I need to consult my wife.
- Behind is a phone booth.

775
00:54:11,530 --> 00:54:13,521
Excuse me.

776
00:54:15,690 --> 00:54:19,286
The women discuss.
That is a sign of weakness.

777
00:54:24,652 --> 00:54:29,042
- What are you doing here?
- I know what I should do a final.

778
00:54:30,411 --> 00:54:33,290
- Come in soon.
- Best.

779
00:54:33,372 --> 00:54:35,567
I can not here yet?

780
00:54:37,932 --> 00:54:42,403
It is finished.
Sorry that I got you this question.

781
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:47,209
I can arrange an audition in Vegas.
They want to negotiate.

782
00:54:47,292 --> 00:54:51,525
You can not give up the courage.
That you have said.

783
00:54:51,614 --> 00:54:54,730
''Let the inner loose bear. ''
Remember?

784
00:54:54,813 --> 00:54:57,043
I know how I can win Ava for me.

785
00:54:58,053 --> 00:55:01,443
I'm mad as a hatter.
Okay, I give you another chance.

786
00:55:05,414 --> 00:55:07,803
- What is it?
- My ice cream comes to top.

787
00:55:07,895 --> 00:55:12,046
- Which ice cream?
- I was so depressed that I went to Sonny devoured.

788
00:55:12,134 --> 00:55:18,370
After a two-liter I knew that I loved Ava
and Cherry Garcia ice cream.

789
00:55:19,014 --> 00:55:23,770
- Not vomiting.
- It is not that way.

790
00:55:23,855 --> 00:55:27,211
- Go to the toilet seat.
- I can not stop.

791
00:55:27,295 --> 00:55:31,174
- First, the lid up.
- That is not big enough.

792
00:55:31,416 --> 00:55:35,647
They did. Sit down.
Ga while I watch.

793
00:55:35,736 --> 00:55:38,613
I do so. I'm busy.

794
00:55:38,695 --> 00:55:41,654
- Who did it?
- I talk to myself.

795
00:55:41,736 --> 00:55:47,766
Sometimes you need to talk it out.
A pep talk for the base pier.

796
00:55:47,856 --> 00:55:51,213
- Oh dear.
- Let me open the window.

797
00:55:51,297 --> 00:55:53,891
Wait until the window is open.

798
00:55:53,977 --> 00:55:58,209
The window is open but a bit.
That is not enough.

799
00:55:58,297 --> 00:56:00,857
You are already started, huh?

800
00:56:00,937 --> 00:56:03,292
It is worse than I thought.

801
00:56:07,137 --> 00:56:10,892
Was it really just ice? I do not believe so.

802
00:56:12,298 --> 00:56:14,858
It is best to. Come on.

803
00:56:18,979 --> 00:56:20,970
Gentlemen. The answer is no.

804
00:56:21,058 --> 00:56:23,129
Thank you for coming.

805
00:56:31,299 --> 00:56:32,891
Was I?

806
00:56:33,819 --> 00:56:37,448
- Can you hear me?
- Cataracts not. I get a complex.

807
00:56:37,539 --> 00:56:41,419
- I try to camouflage.
- Change even color.

808
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:44,172
- What are you doing again?
- He understands me.

809
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:48,294
If he understood me, I would say
I baalde of those animals.

810
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:53,135
If you understand me, I would say
you just had to do to your roses.

811
00:56:53,221 --> 00:56:56,531
- The white Christmas.
- I am sick of this house.

812
00:56:56,621 --> 00:57:00,375
So young and already mad at the world.
That rapmuziek too.

813
00:57:05,821 --> 00:57:07,174
How was it?

814
00:57:07,261 --> 00:57:11,050
- It is not.
- But it's still not Archie?

815
00:57:11,142 --> 00:57:15,340
Archie thinks he knows
Ava for how he can win.

816
00:57:15,421 --> 00:57:17,652
So we continue to sit here?

817
00:57:21,302 --> 00:57:24,215
It is a final walk to the city.

818
00:57:25,142 --> 00:57:27,576
- We collide, huh?
- I want to go home.

819
00:57:27,663 --> 00:57:31,372
Me too, but you're more like.

820
00:57:31,463 --> 00:57:36,412
I am not saying that it is up to you.
Perhaps it is to me.

821
00:57:36,503 --> 00:57:39,381
Your mother thinks you anything about.

822
00:57:39,463 --> 00:57:42,057
- No.
- Sure that nothing is?

823
00:57:42,144 --> 00:57:44,214
Absolutely.

824
00:57:44,303 --> 00:57:46,453
It is fine.

825
00:57:46,544 --> 00:57:50,457
But if something is
then we can talk about.

826
00:57:50,545 --> 00:57:51,863
Fine.

827
00:57:51,944 --> 00:57:54,378
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

828
00:57:54,464 --> 00:57:56,103
Good.

829
00:57:56,184 --> 00:57:59,574
Because your mother is worried and I...

830
00:58:10,585 --> 00:58:12,974
- Dad?
- Yes?

831
00:58:13,066 --> 00:58:16,854
I knew what it was.
You can talk with me.

832
00:58:16,946 --> 00:58:22,463
Father and daughter. Paid your heart out.
We can cry together as...

833
00:58:22,546 --> 00:58:24,822
- What is it?
- Nothing.

834
00:58:24,906 --> 00:58:26,579
Stop.

835
00:58:26,666 --> 00:58:30,580
It will be the mountain air are. There is nothing.

836
00:58:30,666 --> 00:58:32,657
Is everything okay?

837
00:58:39,187 --> 00:58:41,018
Everything is good.

838
00:58:41,107 --> 00:58:43,780
Please take a moment for yourself.

839
00:58:43,868 --> 00:58:45,859
Fine.

840
00:58:51,948 --> 00:58:56,226
No more posturing. Now brave for Ava.

841
00:58:56,748 --> 00:58:59,308
He goes out the beehive.

842
00:58:59,388 --> 00:59:01,140
- Who?
- Archie.

843
00:59:01,229 --> 00:59:03,901
- Who?
- Archie, loser.

844
00:59:04,308 --> 00:59:07,585
This rock is much higher than I thought.

845
00:59:08,469 --> 00:59:10,505
Goodbye, endangered species.

846
00:59:10,590 --> 00:59:14,218
Was that your big plan? Come back.

847
00:59:14,309 --> 00:59:18,861
- I must try this, although I keep it.
- The beer is a peer.

848
00:59:19,150 --> 00:59:23,109
- What are you doing?
- Come back. No games.

849
00:59:23,189 --> 00:59:26,103
I do not Ava by worms to eat.

850
00:59:26,190 --> 00:59:30,945
I will never bosbeer such as Sonny.
I have to prove that it is serious.

851
00:59:31,030 --> 00:59:34,068
If you fall, proves the
you stupid and dead.

852
00:59:34,150 --> 00:59:37,860
What happens?
This circus clown has a new trick.

853
00:59:37,951 --> 00:59:40,544
- Silence.
- It is al

854
00:59:40,631 --> 00:59:43,828
This tree holds him never.
And I am the expert.

855
00:59:45,992 --> 00:59:47,060
Not moving.

856
00:59:47,151 --> 00:59:49,347
- Careful.
- Do I buy honey.

857
00:59:52,312 --> 00:59:53,664
Break.

858
00:59:53,752 --> 00:59:56,346
- This was not a good plan.
- Come back.

859
00:59:56,432 --> 00:59:57,990
It is best.

860
00:59:58,072 --> 01:00:00,541
Bees. Damn.

861
01:00:00,632 --> 01:00:03,625
- I talk to them.
- They stabbing.

862
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:10,702
I see nothing. They stabbing.

863
01:00:10,793 --> 01:00:13,591
- Attacks.
- Stop it.

864
01:00:14,153 --> 01:00:15,950
Defend the hive.

865
01:00:17,313 --> 01:00:19,110
Get him.

866
01:00:19,593 --> 01:00:23,506
- Defend the hive.
- Attacks.

867
01:00:31,314 --> 01:00:33,192
Come back.

868
01:00:33,274 --> 01:00:36,107
- Jumping.
- Insert a salmon.

869
01:00:36,195 --> 01:00:39,153
Ava, I got it for you.

870
01:00:39,235 --> 01:00:42,750
- All right, Archie.
- You got him pulled.

871
01:00:45,195 --> 01:00:47,834
That boy has pit. I like him.

872
01:00:49,316 --> 01:00:51,783
How you get it in your head?

873
01:00:51,875 --> 01:00:54,753
Who would do something now?
Are you crazy?

874
01:00:54,836 --> 01:00:58,510
I had the best basket businesses.
Come on, Ava.

875
01:00:58,596 --> 01:01:01,507
It is nothing between us, but so ga.

876
01:01:03,196 --> 01:01:05,630
- Honey, bear?
- What is it?

877
01:01:05,716 --> 01:01:09,675
- I mean if you still want to honey.
- No, thank you.

878
01:01:09,757 --> 01:01:12,794
Will we have the conservation
the type of talk?

879
01:01:12,877 --> 01:01:16,232
Or you can count to one hundred and tackle me.

880
01:01:16,317 --> 01:01:18,227
Count. Fine.

881
01:01:22,997 --> 01:01:27,310
- He still has too.
- Come on, shut up there.

882
01:01:27,398 --> 01:01:31,630
- I must remain in the open field.
- 1, 2, 10, G, H, P.

883
01:01:31,718 --> 01:01:34,711
- Green, orange, fish...
- Not so fast.

884
01:01:34,798 --> 01:01:37,437
1, 2, 3, 10, five ten.

885
01:01:37,518 --> 01:01:38,792
Hundred.

886
01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:44,310
What happens now?

887
01:01:48,319 --> 01:01:50,310
Papa is back.

888
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:55,791
What is wrong?

889
01:01:56,559 --> 01:01:58,550
It is Archie.

890
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:03,834
All backwards.
Make way for the wild animal.

891
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:08,357
You know the program
As an animal attacks it.

892
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:11,159
So you know what happens when he attacks.

893
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:15,871
There is nothing so dangerous
as half dazed bear.

894
01:02:15,961 --> 01:02:20,716
- With these teeth and claws.
- I am Dr Dolittle. What happened?

895
01:02:20,801 --> 01:02:24,589
He has the door open.
We found him in the kitchen.

896
01:02:24,682 --> 01:02:28,390
- Not true.
- Sorry, Dr Dolittle. Very bad for you.

897
01:02:28,481 --> 01:02:31,679
On the side. There is nothing to see.
Keep moving.

898
01:02:32,281 --> 01:02:35,114
I am. What happened?

899
01:02:35,202 --> 01:02:37,113
I was so close.

900
01:02:37,202 --> 01:02:43,357
It was so unexpected.
Who wants to save the forest here?

901
01:02:43,442 --> 01:02:46,639
We have four acres off.

902
01:02:46,723 --> 01:02:51,398
And we call it 't Dolittle reserve.
We are very gold.

903
01:02:51,483 --> 01:02:53,792
If you have the devil...

904
01:02:53,883 --> 01:02:59,401
- Do not think you've won.
- We cut 'the forest, then we are even.

905
01:02:59,484 --> 01:03:02,999
Thanks, folks. That was all.

906
01:03:04,484 --> 01:03:07,362
Has anyone seen what has happened?

907
01:03:07,444 --> 01:03:10,642
There is only one problem. It is a weasel.

908
01:03:10,723 --> 01:03:14,764
- Oh yeah? What has he done?
- No, it really is a weasel.

909
01:03:14,844 --> 01:03:19,396
- Wezel, the doctor is here.
- You mean Mr. Wezel.

910
01:03:19,484 --> 01:03:24,605
- Did you see what happened with the bear?
- The big bear. Of what I saw?

911
01:03:24,684 --> 01:03:26,756
Have you seen something?

912
01:03:26,845 --> 01:03:30,361
If you give me your watch, I will tell you.

913
01:03:30,445 --> 01:03:33,835
You're a weasel.

914
01:03:34,126 --> 01:03:37,800
- It was Potter. I have a witness.
- An animal?

915
01:03:37,886 --> 01:03:41,277
- That can not testify.
- Do you know something better?

916
01:03:41,365 --> 01:03:44,324
A private detective hired.

917
01:03:44,406 --> 01:03:47,557
The trucks are ready.
Archie goes to a zoo.

918
01:03:47,646 --> 01:03:51,605
If you are witnesses,
Riley leaves nothing great.

919
01:03:51,686 --> 01:03:54,997
- What have I got to lose?
- Your good name.

920
01:03:55,086 --> 01:04:00,162
I do not care.
I let those animals not just in the lurch.

921
01:04:00,487 --> 01:04:05,800
It has been against us.
Therefore we ask for an extra week.

922
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:11,884
Perhaps the plaintiff the animal
in the Betty Ford Clinic for inclusion.

923
01:04:11,969 --> 01:04:14,004
Or the Yogi Bear Clinic.

924
01:04:15,968 --> 01:04:18,562
And if there was malicious?

925
01:04:20,168 --> 01:04:23,241
That is a serious allegation.

926
01:04:23,329 --> 01:04:25,479
Do you have proof?

927
01:04:26,289 --> 01:04:28,246
We have an eyewitness.

928
01:04:28,328 --> 01:04:31,048
Can I just address the court?

929
01:04:31,129 --> 01:04:34,600
- Go ahead.
- We have a witness

930
01:04:34,689 --> 01:04:38,967
who heard a gunshot and saw a truck
the place where it was shot.

931
01:04:39,050 --> 01:04:41,564
Is that a witness in court?

932
01:04:41,650 --> 01:04:46,008
He is not here, because it is...

933
01:04:47,570 --> 01:04:49,242
It is a weasel.

934
01:04:53,571 --> 01:04:55,800
Order.

935
01:04:55,891 --> 01:05:02,684
I know it sounds unlikely,
but I can talk with animals.

936
01:05:02,770 --> 01:05:07,287
I have no objection to
as Dr Dolittle or claimant

937
01:05:07,371 --> 01:05:10,284
eyewitness to the question.

938
01:05:10,372 --> 01:05:15,048
I ask only for a short break
for my camera.

939
01:05:15,132 --> 01:05:18,920
I want a picture as that animal oath.

940
01:05:19,013 --> 01:05:23,164
If the weasel remain anonymous?
We can offer him immunity.

941
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:28,280
Enough. Dr Dolittle, I does not take walk
my courtroom.

942
01:05:28,373 --> 01:05:31,842
The deadline has passed. Motion dismissed.

943
01:05:32,893 --> 01:05:35,532
Too bad. That I want to see.

944
01:05:41,294 --> 01:05:44,411
Can you tell us what the weasel said?

945
01:05:50,533 --> 01:05:53,288
Come fetch me?

946
01:05:53,854 --> 01:05:56,129
- Sort of.
- What do you mean, ''something''?

947
01:05:56,215 --> 01:05:59,412
I could not prove your story, so...

948
01:05:59,494 --> 01:06:01,804
So what?

949
01:06:02,055 --> 01:06:06,333
They find it too dangerous
you to release them, so...

950
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:13,609
You're a Mexican circus sold.

951
01:06:18,015 --> 01:06:20,449
I am so sorry.

952
01:06:20,856 --> 01:06:23,324
- Why?
- At all.

953
01:06:23,416 --> 01:06:29,366
I dragged you here,
you gave false hope and have your life ruined.

954
01:06:29,457 --> 01:06:33,335
You got me just one life.

955
01:06:34,097 --> 01:06:39,092
You have taught me what love is.
That does me no longer.

956
01:06:44,618 --> 01:06:48,736
- What are you doing here?
- Mama would not appeal.

957
01:06:50,378 --> 01:06:52,767
We knew that there was little chance.

958
01:06:58,698 --> 01:07:03,170
- You can at least be an artist again.
- I want no more.

959
01:07:03,259 --> 01:07:05,932
- I want Ava.
- I know.

960
01:07:06,858 --> 01:07:09,453
Maybe I do not deserve love.

961
01:07:10,899 --> 01:07:15,290
- Everyone deserves love.
- Exactly. Everyone...

962
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:28,973
- Charisse, since when?
- A couple of weeks.

963
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:33,539
First, it was still a bit vague.

964
01:07:33,621 --> 01:07:37,933
But now it is very clear.

965
01:07:38,741 --> 01:07:42,893
- So that was you hidden.
- I did not want to be freak.

966
01:07:42,981 --> 01:07:46,770
You do not freak. Absolutely not.

967
01:07:47,581 --> 01:07:51,257
I was also afraid in the beginning,
but you see it wrong.

968
01:07:51,342 --> 01:07:53,537
- It is good.
- How?

969
01:07:53,622 --> 01:07:56,182
Look at the good things it brings.

970
01:07:56,262 --> 01:08:00,050
- What then?
- Do you see us. The only al

971
01:08:03,382 --> 01:08:07,295
Now I know what I miss. Family.

972
01:08:07,383 --> 01:08:10,056
I will never have.

973
01:08:10,143 --> 01:08:14,659
You must help him.
Can we really do nothing?

974
01:08:15,262 --> 01:08:20,132
And not only him, but all animals.
There are so many.

975
01:08:23,063 --> 01:08:25,624
There are indeed many.

976
01:08:31,144 --> 01:08:34,501
- You provide the courage.
- What can I do?

977
01:08:34,584 --> 01:08:37,702
I am six years.
That is not young for a beaver.

978
01:08:37,784 --> 01:08:40,253
How long we live here now?

979
01:08:40,344 --> 01:08:43,223
Around 100 years we presses forest is already decreasing.

980
01:08:43,305 --> 01:08:44,784
This is a great time.

981
01:08:44,865 --> 01:08:50,019
I've tried, but I can
not alone. You need help.

982
01:08:50,105 --> 01:08:54,781
And believe it or not,
but you have much power.

983
01:08:54,865 --> 01:08:58,654
All expressions for the best
have an animal inside.

984
01:08:58,746 --> 01:09:01,579
Brave as a lion, as strong as an ox.

985
01:09:01,666 --> 01:09:04,499
An eagle eye or rank as a gazelle.

986
01:09:04,706 --> 01:09:06,743
Or smell like a skunk.

987
01:09:06,826 --> 01:09:11,378
Sorry. You know what I mean.
Together we can.

988
01:09:11,467 --> 01:09:13,616
We can not just give up.

989
01:09:13,707 --> 01:09:18,303
Spread the word, from Sicily to SeaWorld:
The trucks come by.

990
01:09:18,387 --> 01:09:21,220
The beaver is right.

991
01:09:34,628 --> 01:09:36,937
Boys, on the side.

992
01:09:40,668 --> 01:09:42,465
If you let it.

993
01:09:43,149 --> 01:09:45,264
Everyone in his place.

994
01:09:51,869 --> 01:09:54,258
Hasta la vista, baby.

995
01:09:56,109 --> 01:09:58,100
Windows closed.

996
01:09:59,190 --> 01:10:01,579
Something I have never seen.

997
01:10:01,670 --> 01:10:04,230
- They do not give milk.
- What?

998
01:10:04,310 --> 01:10:06,345
They are all dry.

999
01:10:06,950 --> 01:10:09,589
- What is it, Anna Belle?
- Tied.

1000
01:10:09,710 --> 01:10:12,224
Strike, strike.

1001
01:10:13,311 --> 01:10:17,098
- You want some scrambled eggs?
- Strike, strike.

1002
01:10:17,511 --> 01:10:21,550
Fetch it, fetch the frisbee. Grab him.

1003
01:10:25,352 --> 01:10:27,501
Strike, strike.

1004
01:10:27,952 --> 01:10:30,182
Enter here the belt.

1005
01:10:42,232 --> 01:10:46,021
All the animals work together. You are so Friday

1006
01:10:46,953 --> 01:10:50,992
Ridiculous.
Animals can not organize.

1007
01:10:51,074 --> 01:10:55,544
- Then you look.
- All animals are held.

1008
01:10:55,633 --> 01:10:59,024
They strike from Texas to Paris.

1009
01:10:59,113 --> 01:11:02,549
In Brooklyn, Mexico and Canada.

1010
01:11:04,073 --> 01:11:07,783
Maybe gotta anyway
Dolittle to talk.

1011
01:11:07,874 --> 01:11:12,504
And me a bunch of animals
leave on the head?

1012
01:11:12,594 --> 01:11:15,905
If I can handle the democrats,
can I animals too.

1013
01:11:15,994 --> 01:11:17,951
Attacks.

1014
01:11:21,115 --> 01:11:22,912
- Opgehoepeld.
- Watch.

1015
01:11:22,994 --> 01:11:25,145
- Get out.
- Retreat.

1016
01:11:25,235 --> 01:11:26,793
Hup.

1017
01:11:28,116 --> 01:11:29,708
Organized.

1018
01:11:41,956 --> 01:11:45,631
Two boom Annen on alpha, tango, nine.

1019
01:11:46,075 --> 01:11:48,227
Target in sight, the leader.

1020
01:11:48,316 --> 01:11:50,751
- Do you want some?
- Bombs go.

1021
01:11:51,677 --> 01:11:54,714
- Roger.
- Well done, guys.

1022
01:11:55,997 --> 01:11:58,794
The party is not over.

1023
01:12:03,197 --> 01:12:06,907
No sudden movements.

1024
01:12:08,478 --> 01:12:10,469
Attacks. Opening salvo.

1025
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:14,510
Clot loose. Salvo song two.

1026
01:12:17,558 --> 01:12:19,947
Back to base and recharge.

1027
01:12:21,398 --> 01:12:23,913
- You have the...
- What?

1028
01:12:23,999 --> 01:12:26,911
You've done the door.

1029
01:12:30,519 --> 01:12:34,149
- Run.
- I am a lawyer.

1030
01:12:34,238 --> 01:12:37,470
- Run.
- There he is again. Get that kid.

1031
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:40,552
Attacks.

1032
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:41,834
Not my face.

1033
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:48,832
Please, no. Let's talk.

1034
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:51,832
I grab my phone and call Dr. Dolittle.

1035
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:55,317
No crazy things that I little bee in your cannoli.

1036
01:12:55,401 --> 01:12:58,392
The number of Dr John Dolittle?

1037
01:12:59,681 --> 01:13:02,070
Not Stuart Little. Dolittle.

1038
01:13:06,281 --> 01:13:11,037
- Mr. Potter. How are you?
- Can better. Your friends are here.

1039
01:13:11,202 --> 01:13:13,716
Do you believe now that they can organize?

1040
01:13:13,802 --> 01:13:16,634
I do not know what to believe.

1041
01:13:16,722 --> 01:13:23,561
I would best a discussion with the animals
arrange for the problems to talk.

1042
01:13:23,642 --> 01:13:28,796
That is the only way to here
to arrive without any sounds.

1043
01:13:28,883 --> 01:13:32,034
I think all good, as you call them back.

1044
01:13:32,683 --> 01:13:35,881
Well. Enter the raccoon on.

1045
01:13:35,963 --> 01:13:40,320
He wants you to speak. Keep it short.

1046
01:13:40,404 --> 01:13:43,201
Everything under control. I still call.

1047
01:13:43,763 --> 01:13:48,518
I'm intermediary
for negotiations between Potter

1048
01:13:48,604 --> 01:13:53,633
and Members
of the federal forest department 534.

1049
01:13:53,724 --> 01:13:55,362
About the order of the day.

1050
01:13:55,444 --> 01:13:59,563
This is my new proposal.

1051
01:13:59,644 --> 01:14:02,603
What are the conditions? How much land?

1052
01:14:02,685 --> 01:14:05,358
It is only 4. 5 hectare.

1053
01:14:05,445 --> 01:14:09,040
- I have 4. 5 in the claws.
- They feel good.

1054
01:14:09,126 --> 01:14:11,720
I'll just give what you find.

1055
01:14:14,686 --> 01:14:16,324
That means''no''.

1056
01:14:17,927 --> 01:14:20,076
Or''no''to my never.

1057
01:14:20,325 --> 01:14:24,399
The strike continued.
Even the pros did it.

1058
01:14:24,487 --> 01:14:28,525
The last riders appear
the starthek.

1059
01:14:28,606 --> 01:14:34,159
The Derby starts.
The doors close and they go.

1060
01:14:34,247 --> 01:14:37,045
thick beet
we do not

1061
01:14:38,087 --> 01:14:39,964
Walk the stupid race yourself.

1062
01:14:40,047 --> 01:14:44,723
- Run a mile.
- And by that whip.

1063
01:14:44,808 --> 01:14:47,163
Ladies and gentlemen, Shamu.

1064
01:14:50,968 --> 01:14:52,959
Here is Shamu.

1065
01:14:55,048 --> 01:14:58,279
I do not want to jump. You?

1066
01:14:58,368 --> 01:15:01,166
I do not. I've just eaten.

1067
01:15:03,328 --> 01:15:05,479
Mr. Potter, we have a deal?

1068
01:15:11,049 --> 01:15:14,564
- All right, Doc.
- Is he all mine.

1069
01:15:15,650 --> 01:15:20,770
Vive le bear. Vive le Archie.
Vive le docteur.

1070
01:15:21,849 --> 01:15:25,207
- Come to the big bear.
- Nothing of it.

1071
01:15:25,290 --> 01:15:28,008
I am not for you I've had in the claws.

1072
01:15:28,090 --> 01:15:31,720
- Moment, then.
- Come on.

1073
01:15:35,250 --> 01:15:38,049
You broke my spine.

1074
01:15:43,811 --> 01:15:46,804
Drive gently. Belt.

1075
01:15:50,372 --> 01:15:52,567
Archie, are you in?

1076
01:15:54,172 --> 01:15:56,208
I came to say goodbye.

1077
01:15:56,932 --> 01:16:00,004
- Thanks for everything.
- Sure.

1078
01:16:00,092 --> 01:16:02,447
Archie, I'm ready.

1079
01:16:02,532 --> 01:16:06,286
It is drafty.
Sorry, just to save the species.

1080
01:16:07,373 --> 01:16:10,524
Do your best, Archie.

1081
01:16:16,253 --> 01:16:17,652
It was the summer did.

1082
01:16:22,654 --> 01:16:25,373
- What are you doing?
- What I do?

1083
01:16:27,294 --> 01:16:29,285
Let me put it this way.

1084
01:16:34,814 --> 01:16:37,045
You too?

1085
01:16:37,534 --> 01:16:40,413
Charisse and Doc were thick with each other.

1086
01:16:40,494 --> 01:16:43,293
No worries. You learn it well.

1087
01:16:43,495 --> 01:16:47,011
I can not turn.
My verkleurder is broken.

1088
01:16:47,095 --> 01:16:49,610
You learn it to discolor.

1089
01:16:49,695 --> 01:16:53,483
How? Pepito can not understand.
Pepito is pet.

1090
01:16:56,296 --> 01:16:58,764
Look. I fall not.

1091
01:16:59,136 --> 01:17:02,253
- I am invisible.
- Yes.

1092
01:17:02,337 --> 01:17:04,804
- Good.
- Who would ever doubt?

1093
01:17:04,896 --> 01:17:08,775
The large verkleurder is back.
King of the Third World.

1094
01:17:08,856 --> 01:17:12,486
May the whole house in that color?
It is very feng shui.

1095
01:17:12,817 --> 01:17:16,014
But the best news
then came the spring.

1096
01:17:17,897 --> 01:17:19,615
Come on, kids.

1097
01:17:20,578 --> 01:17:23,091
Here.

1098
01:17:23,177 --> 01:17:26,375
Step, step, spin, kick, step.

1099
01:17:26,458 --> 01:17:29,255
Papa, it was still
step, kick, spin, step, step?

1100
01:17:29,337 --> 01:17:31,772
Come on. The premiere is about six weeks.

1101
01:17:31,858 --> 01:17:36,090
- You could hack it.
- We are just to play.

1102
01:17:36,178 --> 01:17:38,374
From the chorus.

1103
01:18:24,302 --> 01:18:27,533
I have never been a dull party.

1104
01:18:27,621 --> 01:18:31,695
You do so stiff. Come on, polonaise.

1105
01:18:31,781 --> 01:18:35,933
Are they real?
The party can begin. Come on.

1106
01:18:36,022 --> 01:18:40,379
What a party, what a party.
From your roof. By the ribbon.

1107
01:18:59,064 --> 01:19:02,773
Can you see me?
Fixed not. I am invisible.

1108
01:19:02,864 --> 01:19:06,060
Sure does. I see you both.

1109
01:19:08,864 --> 01:19:13,143
I know a place on the Seine
where the naked monkeys deinen
