1
00:01:21,892 --> 00:01:23,692
He's on the way, Mack.

2
00:01:23,772 --> 00:01:27,291
- I'll drop him right in your lap.
- We're all set up.

3
00:01:27,371 --> 00:01:32,131
Alex, everything by the book.
No stunts and no wrecks today, all right?

4
00:01:38,651 --> 00:01:39,451
Oh, shit!

5
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:51,490
It's little things I'm trying to get used to.

6
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:56,810
Like, if I drop my napkin
out in a restaurant, Alex gives me his.

7
00:01:56,889 --> 00:02:01,328
Car door needs opening, he opens it.
My neighbor's abusive? He yells at 'em.

8
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:04,968
The other night, we were watching a video,
he let me pick it out.

9
00:02:07,489 --> 00:02:09,889
D-Do you want to slowly merge into...

10
00:02:09,969 --> 00:02:12,008
- Signal first!

11
00:02:13,288 --> 00:02:14,968
Too late. OK.

12
00:02:15,048 --> 00:02:17,208
- That's good.
- All right.

13
00:02:17,287 --> 00:02:20,287
My last boyfriend wasn't the romantic type.

14
00:02:20,368 --> 00:02:23,687
Two years ago, for my birthday,
he gives me pepper spray.

15
00:02:23,766 --> 00:02:27,128
I think it's perfume.
I end up in the emergency room.

16
00:02:27,207 --> 00:02:31,287
Relationships based on
extreme circumstances never work out.

17
00:02:31,366 --> 00:02:32,247
Right.

18
00:02:32,326 --> 00:02:33,406
- Right?
- No!

19
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,166
Watch the glass!

20
00:02:39,366 --> 00:02:41,326
Your boyfriend drive like this?

21
00:02:41,405 --> 00:02:45,046
Oh, Alex? No. No, no, no.
Alex is so completely different.

22
00:02:45,126 --> 00:02:50,406
He works... he works beach patrol.
He spends all day on a bicycle in Venice.

23
00:03:22,163 --> 00:03:23,483
Shit.

24
00:03:40,242 --> 00:03:42,681
I'm sure he's on the beach right now.

25
00:03:42,761 --> 00:03:45,681
That's how we met, by the way.
I was jaywalking.

26
00:03:45,761 --> 00:03:47,121
Jaywalking, huh?

27
00:03:47,201 --> 00:03:49,201
Well, jaywalking is a crime.

28
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,280
Yeah, but I needed to get across
and at the point...

29
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,801
Dip!

30
00:03:53,881 --> 00:03:54,800
Ow.

31
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:55,681
Another dip!

32
00:03:56,921 --> 00:03:59,880
Oh! Aagh!

33
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,600
Two dips.

34
00:04:01,679 --> 00:04:05,199
- It's our seven-month anniversary tonight.

35
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:07,519
Neither of us has ever dated longer.

36
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,519
Why don't you slow down...

37
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,920
..and tell me your problem, huh? Good.

38
00:04:11,999 --> 00:04:13,599
Uh, make a left here.

39
00:04:13,679 --> 00:04:16,279
Uh, turn, signal! Easy!

40
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:37,197
Shit!

41
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,956
Miss, pull over to the side, please.

42
00:04:41,196 --> 00:04:43,716
Move over to the side, please!

43
00:04:43,796 --> 00:04:46,196
- Side.
- I can't! There's a cliff!

44
00:04:48,476 --> 00:04:50,116
On my command!

45
00:04:50,197 --> 00:04:51,076
Shit!

46
00:04:55,555 --> 00:04:58,876
Hold your fire, he's too far!
Everybody in the car!

47
00:05:42,312 --> 00:05:43,592
You're under arrest.

48
00:05:43,672 --> 00:05:46,192
You have the right to remain silent.

49
00:05:46,272 --> 00:05:47,232
Ow. That hurt.

50
00:05:49,312 --> 00:05:51,231
Pull over to the side.

51
00:05:51,311 --> 00:05:53,151
- I can't!
- Stop right here.

52
00:05:53,231 --> 00:05:57,870
This is absolutely not my fault, Mr Kenter.
I need my licence back.

53
00:05:57,951 --> 00:05:59,431
Oh, my God.

54
00:05:59,511 --> 00:06:00,711
What? What?

55
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:02,470
Stop! Stop!

56
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:13,869
You'll never drive in this town again.

57
00:06:15,349 --> 00:06:16,470
Alex?

58
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,270
Annie.

59
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,469
What... What happened? What...?

60
00:06:23,309 --> 00:06:26,469
- How'd the driving test go?
- Oh, it, uh...

61
00:06:27,508 --> 00:06:28,988
Not good. Not good.

62
00:06:29,068 --> 00:06:31,708
Um, why aren't you... at the beach?

63
00:06:31,788 --> 00:06:34,189
You know, it's funny. There's this...

64
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:35,709
..perfectly...

65
00:06:35,788 --> 00:06:39,588
- ..reasonable explanation...
- You're a madman, Shaw!

66
00:06:39,667 --> 00:06:42,868
Nice working with you, as always.

67
00:06:42,947 --> 00:06:45,627
They've apprehended
one of the suspects,...

68
00:06:45,707 --> 00:06:48,507
..thanks mainly
to SWAT member Alex Shaw,...

69
00:06:48,586 --> 00:06:51,466
..who was the officer injured
in today's chase.

70
00:06:51,546 --> 00:06:54,627
- You lied to me.
- I didn't lie about...

71
00:06:54,707 --> 00:06:57,867
You never said
you were on the suicide squad.

72
00:06:57,946 --> 00:07:00,466
You knew I was a cop. I said that I was...

73
00:07:00,546 --> 00:07:01,746
Wait.

74
00:07:02,746 --> 00:07:04,506
Oh, come on. Ow.

75
00:07:04,585 --> 00:07:09,664
When I told you about Jack
and how he was always getting hurt,...

76
00:07:09,746 --> 00:07:13,185
..and how I would never date
anybody like that again,...

77
00:07:13,265 --> 00:07:17,865
..you didn't think, "Maybe I should tell her
what I do for a living"?

78
00:07:17,944 --> 00:07:19,984
Exactly. And blow it?

79
00:07:21,064 --> 00:07:23,864
- When were you gonna tell me ?
- Well, today.

80
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:24,823
Oh, today?

81
00:07:24,904 --> 00:07:27,785
Yeah, today was the day.

82
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:32,064
You know what I pictured you doing
in Venice? I pictured you...

83
00:07:32,143 --> 00:07:34,384
..busting teenage pickpockets,...

84
00:07:34,463 --> 00:07:37,663
..walking old women across the street,
drinking lemonade.

85
00:07:37,743 --> 00:07:40,903
I do fill in for a friend
at the beach occasionally.

86
00:07:40,983 --> 00:07:43,982
And I often, often
enjoy a nice glass of lemonade.

87
00:07:44,062 --> 00:07:47,063
You know what?
I feel I don't even know you.

88
00:07:47,142 --> 00:07:50,382
I don't know who you are any more.
I don't understand.

89
00:07:51,462 --> 00:07:56,022
We got to spend some time together,
then we'll get to know each other.

90
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:59,301
- Let's go away together.
- OK, where?

91
00:07:59,381 --> 00:08:00,381
The Caribbean.

92
00:08:00,461 --> 00:08:03,422
Oh, the Caribbean.
Do you have a concussion?

93
00:08:03,501 --> 00:08:05,981
We work six days a week, Alex.

94
00:08:06,061 --> 00:08:09,261
We've never even been away
for a... a weekend.

95
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:15,380
I was going to surprise you tonight,
but, uh...

96
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,940
It's a cruise.

97
00:08:21,461 --> 00:08:23,220
This is so unfair, Alex.

98
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,740
You can't pull out tickets
to some exotic island...

99
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,419
..and think that'll make everything OK.

100
00:08:29,499 --> 00:08:34,058
I don't expect that I can make it all right,
but, maybe I thought we could.

101
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:35,379
No. Don't do that.

102
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:38,458
I wanna be depressed.
I don't want you to do that.

103
00:08:38,538 --> 00:08:39,419
Don't!

104
00:08:39,499 --> 00:08:41,378
All right, all right.

105
00:08:43,258 --> 00:08:45,578
- Don't.
- I won't.

106
00:09:13,735 --> 00:09:16,376
Welcome to the Seabourn Legend.

107
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:18,015
Thank you. Welcome.

108
00:09:18,096 --> 00:09:20,055
Oh, now, this is a cute couple.

109
00:09:20,136 --> 00:09:22,895
How about a picture? Don't move!

110
00:09:22,975 --> 00:09:25,054
- What are your names?
- Annie and Alex.

111
00:09:25,135 --> 00:09:26,375
My name's Dante.

112
00:09:26,455 --> 00:09:30,454
- A big smile for the newlyweds?
-Actually, we're not newlyweds.

113
00:09:30,534 --> 00:09:35,734
Only $34.50 for a double set of mugs, and if
you don't like them, you get a photo credit.

114
00:09:35,814 --> 00:09:38,774
Welcome to paradise,
and the name's Dante!

115
00:09:38,854 --> 00:09:41,214
This ship has five passenger decks,...

116
00:09:41,293 --> 00:09:43,173
..A, B, C, D, E.

117
00:09:43,254 --> 00:09:44,653
You're on deck C.

118
00:09:44,733 --> 00:09:48,813
There's a swimming pool,
a health spa, a beauty salon, a casino...

119
00:09:48,892 --> 00:09:50,213
Hey. Excuse me.

120
00:09:50,294 --> 00:09:51,373
Sir?

121
00:09:51,453 --> 00:09:54,773
I'm a little upset.
My golf clubs - have you found them?

122
00:09:54,853 --> 00:09:58,452
Yes. They're downstairs in storage
and I'll bring them up...

123
00:09:58,532 --> 00:10:03,451
..as soon as I get
this lovely couple to their cabin.

124
00:10:08,652 --> 00:10:13,452
These are the coordinates
for the first leg, Captain.

125
00:10:13,531 --> 00:10:15,212
Thank you.

126
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:16,291
Thruster is in.

127
00:10:16,371 --> 00:10:20,010
- All engines on stand-by.
- Let's take her out, then.

128
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:24,250
Welcome to your suite.

129
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:29,170
Believe me, you'll be sorry to leave room
6088, your happy and humble home.

130
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:34,210
If you need anything, you just call Ashton.

131
00:10:34,289 --> 00:10:37,289
And let me thank you both
in advance for the generous gratuity...

132
00:10:37,369 --> 00:10:39,089
..l know you'll be leaving me
at the end of this cruise.

133
00:10:39,169 --> 00:10:41,728
- Just kidding.
- But not really.

134
00:10:43,488 --> 00:10:46,929
Oh. And, you two, have a nice honeymoon.

135
00:10:47,008 --> 00:10:48,569
Oh, we're... we're not...

136
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,648
..not married.

137
00:10:56,048 --> 00:10:57,447
Thank you.

138
00:10:57,967 --> 00:10:59,807
Thank you.

139
00:11:00,047 --> 00:11:03,408
- Big enough for you?
- Size doesn't matter. You know that.

140
00:11:03,488 --> 00:11:04,568
Yes!

141
00:11:05,847 --> 00:11:09,087
All of a sudden,
I have Love Boat fever.

142
00:11:09,167 --> 00:11:10,567
It feels really good.

143
00:11:10,647 --> 00:11:14,006
I am really excited
about being on a cruise ship.

144
00:11:14,086 --> 00:11:15,806
I don't know why.

145
00:11:15,886 --> 00:11:19,085
Maybe they pump drugs
through the air-conditioning system.

146
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:21,006
What do you think?

147
00:11:21,086 --> 00:11:24,806
You know what I need?
Lots of those yummy little drinks...

148
00:11:24,885 --> 00:11:28,405
..with those
highly impractical umbrellas in 'em.

149
00:11:28,486 --> 00:11:31,245
That is what I need.

150
00:11:31,325 --> 00:11:33,964
Yeah, you're looking good.

151
00:11:34,045 --> 00:11:37,846
So, who's ready to party
on the big boat besides me?

152
00:11:40,765 --> 00:11:42,405
You look tense.

153
00:11:42,484 --> 00:11:45,285
Tense? No. We're here to relax.

154
00:11:45,364 --> 00:11:46,964
- Let's get a drink.
- Let's go.

155
00:11:47,524 --> 00:11:49,763
We're going to have a really good time.

156
00:12:19,202 --> 00:12:20,601
Yeah!

157
00:12:27,281 --> 00:12:29,200
Love it!

158
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,921
Thank you.

159
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:32,921
See you later. Bye.

160
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,200
So, what do you want to do?

161
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:47,079
Do you want to shuffleboard,
then room or... room, then shuffleboard?

162
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:48,599
Or hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm?

163
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,880
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.

164
00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:52,119
Room, room.

165
00:12:52,199 --> 00:12:53,479
OK.

166
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:58,398
If it's all right with your new boyfriend
over there. Romeo.

167
00:12:58,478 --> 00:12:59,519
His name's Geiger.

168
00:12:59,598 --> 00:13:01,478
- Oh?
- Yes. Yes, we talked.

169
00:13:01,558 --> 00:13:05,598
Not very interested in golf
for someone who had a fit about his clubs.

170
00:13:05,677 --> 00:13:08,078
- Why do you say that?
- Well,...

171
00:13:08,158 --> 00:13:12,677
..the tournament's on behind him.
He hasn't even glanced at the TV.

172
00:13:14,557 --> 00:13:18,756
You're absolutely right. I think
we need to arrest him. Excuse me!

173
00:13:18,837 --> 00:13:20,877
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

174
00:13:20,956 --> 00:13:24,277
Aw, honey, you just wanted a hug.

175
00:13:24,357 --> 00:13:25,757
You're so sweet.

176
00:13:27,117 --> 00:13:28,997
I got to ask you to do me a favour,...

177
00:13:29,076 --> 00:13:31,995
..something I've never
asked you to do before.

178
00:13:32,076 --> 00:13:32,996
What's that?

179
00:13:34,276 --> 00:13:37,435
- I need you to boogie with me.
- Oh, no, I don't boogie.

180
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:39,635
Just run in place. Run in place.

181
00:13:39,715 --> 00:13:42,034
- Do you feel it?
- Yeah, I think so.

182
00:13:42,116 --> 00:13:43,196
Come on, baby.

183
00:14:12,472 --> 00:14:14,752
Wake up, boys.

184
00:15:25,627 --> 00:15:28,746
See, the misconception is that fat is bad.

185
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:30,947
In order to lose fat, you shouldn't eat fat.

186
00:15:31,027 --> 00:15:32,667
Well, guess what, guys?

187
00:15:32,747 --> 00:15:35,427
False. Your body's just a giant computer.

188
00:15:35,506 --> 00:15:38,466
Mm. See, if you don't eat fat,...

189
00:15:38,546 --> 00:15:40,386
..your body's mainframe goes, whoa!

190
00:15:40,466 --> 00:15:41,305
Whoa!

191
00:15:41,386 --> 00:15:44,185
Better keep whatever fat I've got.

192
00:15:44,265 --> 00:15:46,385
So you see, we at Fatbusters...

193
00:15:46,465 --> 00:15:48,386
..well, we say fat is your friend.

194
00:15:48,465 --> 00:15:49,586
Oh, yeah, a good friend, yeah.

195
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:50,826
I could use a good friend.

196
00:15:50,905 --> 00:15:52,665
Yeah? Here, meet this guy.

197
00:15:52,745 --> 00:15:54,025
- Mmm.
- Good.

198
00:15:54,105 --> 00:15:55,745
There you go.

199
00:16:12,023 --> 00:16:14,583
Ladies and gentlemen,...

200
00:16:14,664 --> 00:16:15,983
..l have a question.

201
00:16:16,063 --> 00:16:18,023
Who here would like a peek...

202
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:21,423
..at a multimillion-dollar
jewellery collection?

203
00:16:23,343 --> 00:16:27,663
OK. On board, we have the Diamond
Jewellers Of America with us tonight.

204
00:16:27,743 --> 00:16:30,862
They would like to show you something.

205
00:16:30,942 --> 00:16:33,182
Maybe we should get you a little something.

206
00:16:33,262 --> 00:16:35,261
I'll take a Camel unfiltered.

207
00:16:35,342 --> 00:16:37,262
Aren't you wearing the nicotine patch?

208
00:16:37,341 --> 00:16:39,021
The only way that patch is gonna help me...

209
00:16:39,101 --> 00:16:41,142
..is if I roll it and smoke it.

210
00:16:41,221 --> 00:16:42,382
Good evening.

211
00:16:43,661 --> 00:16:46,061
Big diamond.

212
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,859
Don't bunny-hop.

213
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:34,657
That's impressive.

214
00:17:34,738 --> 00:17:37,377
I wanted to learn another language.

215
00:17:37,457 --> 00:17:38,938
Her name is Drew.

216
00:17:43,056 --> 00:17:45,776
She wants to know if you're my sister.

217
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:47,576
Oh.

218
00:17:47,656 --> 00:17:49,256
Let her down easy.

219
00:17:54,736 --> 00:17:57,375
She says you're very beautiful and...

220
00:17:59,135 --> 00:18:01,135
..our kids will be very beautiful.

221
00:18:03,095 --> 00:18:04,135
Thank you.

222
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:13,174
Uh, can you picture me as a mum?

223
00:18:13,255 --> 00:18:14,974
I think you'd make a beautiful mother.

224
00:18:15,054 --> 00:18:18,254
Just, uh, don't drive the carpool.

225
00:18:20,493 --> 00:18:23,573
Jeez. Kids... I don't know.

226
00:18:23,653 --> 00:18:26,012
What, kids aren't on the menu?

227
00:18:26,093 --> 00:18:27,574
Uh, kids are on the menu.

228
00:18:27,653 --> 00:18:29,654
It just depends on who's ordering.

229
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:34,253
- I love it. It's beautiful.
- You're beautiful.

230
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:36,773
That'll make a great picture.
Hold on. Let me get this one.

231
00:18:36,852 --> 00:18:39,452
- Look.
- Look.

232
00:18:42,931 --> 00:18:45,131
So, can I order à la carte?

233
00:18:47,492 --> 00:18:50,852
I don't know if you're sittin' in my section.

234
00:18:50,931 --> 00:18:52,971
I requested this table.

235
00:18:55,531 --> 00:18:56,931
Are you a good tipper?

236
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,490
Hmm. Depends on the service.

237
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:03,211
It's always service with a smile for you.

238
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:05,130
How about at every meal?

239
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:08,570
You getting serious right now?

240
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:10,330
Well,...

241
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:13,249
- Yeah, l...
- Wow.

242
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:14,650
I mean,...

243
00:19:14,729 --> 00:19:15,890
..wow.

244
00:19:15,969 --> 00:19:17,809
I just, you know, the other day,...

245
00:19:17,889 --> 00:19:20,289
..l just found out I'm dating a daredevil,...

246
00:19:20,369 --> 00:19:22,370
..so this is like, you know...

247
00:19:24,769 --> 00:19:26,849
Oh, you're not serious.

248
00:19:26,929 --> 00:19:28,368
You're not.

249
00:19:29,648 --> 00:19:32,168
- Hello?
- Annie?

250
00:19:32,328 --> 00:19:33,688
What?

251
00:19:33,767 --> 00:19:35,847
I'm, uh, I'm a little seasick.

252
00:19:35,927 --> 00:19:38,567
Huh? OK.

253
00:19:38,647 --> 00:19:40,448
Let's go.

254
00:20:35,804 --> 00:20:38,244
I'll get the main valve!

255
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:45,283
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, sir.

256
00:20:55,962 --> 00:20:58,961
I'm sorry, sir. You can't be here right now.

257
00:20:59,042 --> 00:21:00,241
I must be lost.

258
00:21:00,321 --> 00:21:04,281
I saw the lights,
thought this was the casino.

259
00:21:04,361 --> 00:21:07,240
Uh, sir, please don't touch those!

260
00:21:08,481 --> 00:21:11,761
Sure could use a drink.

261
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,361
Any of you gambling men?

262
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,160
- Uh!
- Sir!

263
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,280
Help the gentleman up, please.

264
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,560
OK, sir, come on.

265
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,959
Let's get him up.

266
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,959
Sir, may we assist you
to help find your cabin?

267
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,559
Oh, no. I know where it is.

268
00:21:24,639 --> 00:21:27,160
I... I know when I'm not wanted.

269
00:21:27,239 --> 00:21:28,359
You guys just...

270
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,519
..watch where you're going.

271
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,359
We'll do just that.

272
00:21:37,278 --> 00:21:38,439
Goodnight, sir.

273
00:21:38,518 --> 00:21:40,918
Listen, let's get you back to your room.

274
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:52,877
Goodnight.

275
00:23:00,032 --> 00:23:02,032
Satellite looks good, sir.

276
00:23:02,112 --> 00:23:05,632
We should have
smooth sailing for the rest of the night.

277
00:23:05,711 --> 00:23:08,151
OK, switch us back to autopilot.

278
00:23:08,232 --> 00:23:09,391
Switching over now, sir.

279
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:10,551
That's right.

280
00:23:10,631 --> 00:23:12,351
Switch us over.

281
00:23:12,431 --> 00:23:13,752
You never let me have any fun.

282
00:23:13,831 --> 00:23:17,231
No fun? You have all the fun in the world.

283
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:19,231
We have fun together, don't we?

284
00:23:19,311 --> 00:23:22,190
Whenever you want something,
I buy it for you automatically.

285
00:23:22,271 --> 00:23:24,670
I take you to concerts, museums, movies.

286
00:23:24,751 --> 00:23:26,150
I do all the housework.

287
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:28,429
Who does the tidying up? I do.

288
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:30,150
Who does the cooking? I do.

289
00:23:30,229 --> 00:23:32,670
You and I, we have lots of fun.

290
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,430
Don't we, Lolita?

291
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:39,389
Come here.

292
00:23:48,629 --> 00:23:50,709
Time for group therapy, boys.

293
00:23:56,628 --> 00:24:00,028
Oh. I wouldn't trade you...

294
00:24:00,107 --> 00:24:02,907
..for all the doctors in the world.

295
00:24:06,427 --> 00:24:09,027
Mmm...

296
00:24:09,108 --> 00:24:11,826
..you take care of me,...

297
00:24:11,907 --> 00:24:14,026
..I'll take care of the ship.

298
00:24:41,824 --> 00:24:42,825
Mm!

299
00:24:46,904 --> 00:24:48,944
Alex?

300
00:24:51,424 --> 00:24:53,823
Annie, Annie.

301
00:24:53,903 --> 00:24:57,023
I've been looking all over the ship for you.

302
00:24:57,103 --> 00:25:01,063
Maybe you should have looked in bed,
where you left me.

303
00:25:01,144 --> 00:25:03,343
You looked so beautiful, I didn't, uh...

304
00:25:03,423 --> 00:25:04,743
..want to wake you up.

305
00:25:04,823 --> 00:25:06,342
Yeah, beautiful woman in bed, naked -

306
00:25:06,423 --> 00:25:08,022
..you had to leave. I get that.

307
00:25:08,102 --> 00:25:09,342
So where were you?

308
00:25:09,423 --> 00:25:12,022
- Skeet shooting.
- Skeet shooting?

309
00:25:12,102 --> 00:25:13,221
You went skeet shooting, but you couldn't...

310
00:25:13,302 --> 00:25:14,262
Is that our song?

311
00:25:14,341 --> 00:25:15,941
..take one day not to go shooting?

312
00:25:16,022 --> 00:25:17,542
I wish they'd play that over and over again.

313
00:25:17,621 --> 00:25:18,822
I need a little fresh air...

314
00:25:18,901 --> 00:25:22,581
..after an evening tied as one
of the most embarrassing of my adult life.

315
00:25:22,662 --> 00:25:24,741
Oh... if you want me to be honest,...

316
00:25:24,821 --> 00:25:27,941
..l kind of like the fact that you got sick.

317
00:25:28,021 --> 00:25:29,541
Well,...

318
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,660
..don't quite know how to respond to that.

319
00:25:31,741 --> 00:25:36,421
Well, all I'm saying is
that I just like taking care of you, that's all.

320
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:42,660
And what I said when
you were joking about that kid thing...

321
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:45,059
..for a second,
I thought you were completely serious.

322
00:25:45,139 --> 00:25:48,259
I thought
you were actually gonna ask, you know...

323
00:25:48,339 --> 00:25:51,378
..and last night,
when you were basically blacked out,...

324
00:25:51,459 --> 00:25:53,659
..l was like, he's a cop, and...

325
00:25:53,739 --> 00:25:55,819
..you don't even know his cop number.

326
00:25:55,899 --> 00:25:57,699
My badge number?

327
00:25:57,779 --> 00:25:59,419
Badge number, see?

328
00:25:59,498 --> 00:26:01,778
I don't even know what it's called.

329
00:26:01,858 --> 00:26:04,538
What does my badge number
have to do with anything?

330
00:26:04,617 --> 00:26:07,217
Well, the point is...
is that if you look at it,...

331
00:26:07,298 --> 00:26:10,577
..we basically don't...
don't even know each other.

332
00:26:10,657 --> 00:26:12,938
And...

333
00:26:13,017 --> 00:26:14,097
Um...

334
00:26:15,497 --> 00:26:17,417
To get that serious and...

335
00:26:18,457 --> 00:26:21,217
..to make that kind of commitment,
I mean,...

336
00:26:22,656 --> 00:26:24,617
..it's probably the last thing that,...

337
00:26:24,696 --> 00:26:27,016
..that we both need right now, right?

338
00:26:27,096 --> 00:26:28,496
Yeah.

339
00:26:30,616 --> 00:26:33,536
Attention.

340
00:26:33,616 --> 00:26:35,416
If you would like to reserve water-skis,...

341
00:26:35,496 --> 00:26:38,015
..paddle boats, jetskis,
or wave runners for use...

342
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:40,135
..while we're docked
at one of our upcoming ports...

343
00:26:40,215 --> 00:26:43,135
Did you feel
we were underdressed last night?

344
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:51,014
What's this?

345
00:26:51,095 --> 00:26:55,814
Excuse me. I do believe
I had the Do Not Disturb sign on the door.

346
00:26:55,894 --> 00:26:58,733
Actually, it was Make Up Room, Please.

347
00:26:58,814 --> 00:27:01,173
Maybe... maybe you flipped the card.

348
00:27:01,254 --> 00:27:03,493
Maybe I flipped the card.

349
00:27:04,814 --> 00:27:06,614
Let's not split hairs.

350
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:28,852
Captain on the bridge.

351
00:27:28,932 --> 00:27:30,411
What's wrong, Merced?

352
00:27:30,491 --> 00:27:31,812
I'm late for my guests.

353
00:27:31,891 --> 00:27:34,051
Uh, yeah, I can't explain it, sir.

354
00:27:34,131 --> 00:27:36,610
We're four degrees off course.

355
00:27:36,691 --> 00:27:38,971
Well, switch us back to manual, then.

356
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:41,491
We tried, sir. The autopilot won't go down.

357
00:27:42,491 --> 00:27:44,771
Well, try again.

358
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:48,410
I did.
I sent an engineer to check the mainframe.

359
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:49,730
It's all normal.

360
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:51,850
I sent Eric to run a mainframe diagnostic.

361
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:54,010
Everything seems normal.

362
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:56,249
Human error.

363
00:27:56,329 --> 00:27:57,929
Must be human error.

364
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:00,730
Keep an eye on it.

365
00:28:00,809 --> 00:28:02,089
Yes, sir.

366
00:28:30,126 --> 00:28:32,446
They were out of size 10s.

367
00:28:32,526 --> 00:28:34,807
You know,
I told them size didn't matter, but, uh...

368
00:28:34,887 --> 00:28:36,086
..they wouldn't give them to me.

369
00:28:52,885 --> 00:28:55,485
- One more thing.
- What?

370
00:28:57,405 --> 00:29:00,005
I'd like to boogie with you.

371
00:29:02,084 --> 00:29:04,084
We're still four degrees off course.

372
00:29:04,164 --> 00:29:05,884
Did you check the mainframe, Eric?

373
00:29:06,923 --> 00:29:09,605
Captain Pollard, good evening.

374
00:29:09,684 --> 00:29:11,564
How can you be running the ship...

375
00:29:11,644 --> 00:29:13,124
..if you're not on the bridge?

376
00:29:13,283 --> 00:29:15,083
Who is running the ship?

377
00:29:15,163 --> 00:29:17,763
Oh, yeah. I am.

378
00:29:17,843 --> 00:29:19,523
What is this? Who are you?

379
00:29:19,603 --> 00:29:22,563
I spent a great many years
developing computer systems...

380
00:29:22,642 --> 00:29:24,802
..for these cruise liners,
including this baby.

381
00:29:24,883 --> 00:29:27,322
And then I got pushed away!

382
00:29:27,403 --> 00:29:28,923
What are you talking about?

383
00:29:29,003 --> 00:29:31,122
That's what really infuriates me.

384
00:29:31,202 --> 00:29:32,962
You don't even know
what I'm talking about.

385
00:29:33,042 --> 00:29:34,522
How dare you!

386
00:29:37,641 --> 00:29:39,121
Traditionally speaking,...

387
00:29:39,202 --> 00:29:41,801
..isn't it true
the captain goes down with the ship?

388
00:29:47,401 --> 00:29:50,480
Aagh!

389
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,800
- I got one more. Stand right here.
- Oh, OK.

390
00:30:05,879 --> 00:30:07,200
- This is good.
- OK.

391
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:11,639
Captain, sweetheart, would you mind
taking a picture with my sister and me?

392
00:30:11,719 --> 00:30:13,799
No. Not at all.

393
00:30:13,878 --> 00:30:15,039
Get in the middle.

394
00:30:15,118 --> 00:30:16,078
Right here. OK.

395
00:30:18,598 --> 00:30:19,638
Say Dallas.

396
00:30:19,718 --> 00:30:20,838
Dallas.

397
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:21,838
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

398
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:24,438
Nice tropical shower.

399
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:28,038
Water's gonna be beautiful tonight, ladies.

400
00:30:30,838 --> 00:30:32,997
Good evening.

401
00:30:38,516 --> 00:30:39,917
No, I'm sorry.

402
00:30:39,997 --> 00:30:41,797
Without a jacket,...

403
00:30:41,877 --> 00:30:44,197
..that dress is not appropriate.

404
00:30:44,277 --> 00:30:45,717
Daddy's right.

405
00:30:45,796 --> 00:30:48,516
I like this dress, and it's fine.

406
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:50,836
No, no, no.

407
00:30:51,036 --> 00:30:53,915
You look like a clown.

408
00:30:53,996 --> 00:30:55,315
No, I don't.

409
00:30:57,716 --> 00:30:58,956
Well, she's fine.

410
00:30:59,035 --> 00:31:00,395
Let her go.

411
00:31:02,396 --> 00:31:04,275
She'll be back.

412
00:31:18,994 --> 00:31:20,074
Ready,...

413
00:31:22,394 --> 00:31:23,393
..now.

414
00:31:43,232 --> 00:31:45,232
What the hell is going on?

415
00:31:45,311 --> 00:31:46,991
I don't know, sir.

416
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:49,391
Where's the chief engineer?

417
00:32:26,429 --> 00:32:29,709
This almost seems too perfect, doesn't it?

418
00:32:29,788 --> 00:32:31,909
Want me to step on your feet?

419
00:32:31,988 --> 00:32:33,308
You already did.

420
00:32:33,388 --> 00:32:35,388
Oh. I meant again.

421
00:32:47,667 --> 00:32:48,587
Hurry.

422
00:32:57,986 --> 00:33:03,307
You know, I left you alone this morning
because I needed to be alone to think.

423
00:33:03,386 --> 00:33:04,706
Yeah.

424
00:33:04,786 --> 00:33:07,586
See, the one thing that's got me
through everything in my life,...

425
00:33:07,665 --> 00:33:09,506
..the one thing I could always trust,...

426
00:33:09,585 --> 00:33:11,825
..has been my instinct.

427
00:33:11,905 --> 00:33:15,465
It has never been more certain
than it is now.

428
00:33:17,065 --> 00:33:18,585
Really?

429
00:33:18,664 --> 00:33:20,105
Yeah.

430
00:33:22,025 --> 00:33:23,904
What are you saying?

431
00:33:23,985 --> 00:33:27,304
What I'm saying is, uh...

432
00:33:28,784 --> 00:33:30,103
..l think that we should...

433
00:33:34,023 --> 00:33:35,703
Oh, man, no. No, no, no, no.

434
00:33:35,782 --> 00:33:38,263
Come on, keep dancing.
Keep dancing. Come on.

435
00:33:43,143 --> 00:33:44,702
Hold up. Hold on.

436
00:33:50,302 --> 00:33:53,142
Jesus Christ! The main pumps are off!

437
00:33:53,221 --> 00:33:55,702
She ain't pumping out!

438
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:57,982
Shut down engines three and four!

439
00:33:58,062 --> 00:33:59,382
Get out of here!

440
00:34:02,901 --> 00:34:03,901
Sir!

441
00:34:03,981 --> 00:34:05,981
Look, they're not gonna hold.

442
00:34:06,061 --> 00:34:06,941
Sir.

443
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:09,620
- Find the captain, will you?
- Yes, sir.

444
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,499
Harvey, it's an earthquake!

445
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:26,219
It can't be! We're at sea!

446
00:34:29,299 --> 00:34:30,379
Aagh!

447
00:34:30,458 --> 00:34:32,059
Ooh! Oh!

448
00:34:33,859 --> 00:34:35,299
Look out!

449
00:34:35,379 --> 00:34:36,819
Watch it!

450
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:39,218
No!

451
00:34:40,058 --> 00:34:41,698
This is my vacation! Damn it!

452
00:34:41,778 --> 00:34:43,378
I had nothing to do with this.

453
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:46,618
It's not working!

454
00:35:31,375 --> 00:35:33,334
It's all right, it's all right.

455
00:35:33,415 --> 00:35:34,294
It's over. It's over.

456
00:35:34,375 --> 00:35:36,174
Ladies and gentleman,...

457
00:35:36,254 --> 00:35:37,933
..I'm Liza, your cruise director.

458
00:35:38,014 --> 00:35:40,533
Uh, this is only a minor incident.

459
00:35:40,613 --> 00:35:43,534
Everything will be back to normal
in a few moments.

460
00:35:43,614 --> 00:35:46,094
Why do I really not believe her right now?

461
00:35:47,253 --> 00:35:49,693
Terminal malfunction, structural trauma.

462
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:51,453
Take a look at these monitors.

463
00:35:51,533 --> 00:35:54,292
We're losing power all over the ship.

464
00:35:54,373 --> 00:35:56,332
I want all emergency teams in position.

465
00:35:56,413 --> 00:35:58,292
Get the coastguard on the line.

466
00:35:58,372 --> 00:35:59,691
I don't care!

467
00:35:59,773 --> 00:36:01,572
Put me onto engine control!

468
00:36:01,653 --> 00:36:02,972
It's dead.

469
00:36:03,052 --> 00:36:04,932
Try the low frequencies.

470
00:36:05,012 --> 00:36:06,571
The signal's gone. I've got nothing.

471
00:36:08,412 --> 00:36:11,171
Engine three's down, sir.
Can we do anything?

472
00:36:11,251 --> 00:36:13,091
Try and run a link to the engine room.

473
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,530
Joe,
issue hand-held radios to all the crew.

474
00:36:15,611 --> 00:36:17,530
And, please, somebody find the captain!

475
00:36:17,612 --> 00:36:18,491
Keep trying.

476
00:36:18,571 --> 00:36:20,211
The system's not responding.

477
00:36:20,291 --> 00:36:22,491
- Yes?
- Mr Juliano.

478
00:36:22,571 --> 00:36:27,530
Looks like
the Seabourn Legend isn't fairing too well.

479
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:30,890
I advise you
to start the evacuation procedure.

480
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:32,409
Who is this?

481
00:36:33,369 --> 00:36:35,690
Someone you should start listening to.

482
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:37,569
I want you to sound the alarm immediately.

483
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:39,930
Time is running out.

484
00:36:40,009 --> 00:36:42,329
I can't do that. Only the captain can.

485
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:44,929
The captain is dead, Mr Juliano,...

486
00:36:45,008 --> 00:36:47,888
..which means you're now responsible
for the people on this ship.

487
00:36:47,968 --> 00:36:52,248
Don't waste time radioing the coastguard
or code in an SOS.

488
00:36:52,328 --> 00:36:55,128
I've cut off all outside communication.

489
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:58,488
You don't understand.
Maritime regulations state that...

490
00:36:58,568 --> 00:37:00,768
Mr Juliano,
you are in command of this vessel.

491
00:37:00,847 --> 00:37:03,488
The authority is yours.

492
00:37:03,567 --> 00:37:06,367
I'll make it easy on you, Mr Juliano.

493
00:37:06,447 --> 00:37:09,206
I'd like you to look at
the emergency fire display.

494
00:37:12,047 --> 00:37:13,887
Look at the portside,...

495
00:37:13,967 --> 00:37:18,286
..C deck, section 686 on your display.

496
00:37:20,206 --> 00:37:22,445
What the hell do you think you're doing?

497
00:37:32,966 --> 00:37:34,606
My God.

498
00:37:38,885 --> 00:37:40,564
Oops.

499
00:37:40,644 --> 00:37:42,484
See what you made me do?

500
00:37:42,564 --> 00:37:44,883
OK, just wait a minute. Please.

501
00:37:44,964 --> 00:37:47,364
And now
the forward section on the A deck...

502
00:37:47,445 --> 00:37:50,284
..on both sides of the bow thrusters.

503
00:37:56,043 --> 00:38:00,763
Also look at deck sections 187 and 188.

504
00:38:10,202 --> 00:38:11,762
Sir?

505
00:38:11,842 --> 00:38:15,362
All the fires are contained
by fire doors, which I control...

506
00:38:15,442 --> 00:38:17,322
..and will open if necessary.

507
00:38:17,401 --> 00:38:19,721
I've positioned charges throughout the ship...

508
00:38:19,801 --> 00:38:22,080
..and will set them off without hesitation.

509
00:38:22,161 --> 00:38:25,241
Sir, I think you should push the button.

510
00:38:27,201 --> 00:38:30,760
How am I supposed to abandon
the ship while it's moving?

511
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:32,881
The ship will stop in exactly three minutes.

512
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,640
I give you 15 minutes to evacuate.

513
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,759
Now sound the alarm...

514
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,560
..or I'll burn her down.

515
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:47,159
Sir,
I really think you should push the button.

516
00:39:04,038 --> 00:39:06,318
Attention. Attention, please.

517
00:39:06,398 --> 00:39:08,558
This is the First Officer.

518
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:12,117
All passengers and crew,
proceed to the muster deck.

519
00:39:12,197 --> 00:39:15,477
The Seabourn Legend
is to be immediately evacuated.

520
00:39:15,557 --> 00:39:17,358
This is not a drill.

521
00:39:17,437 --> 00:39:19,757
I repeat, this is not a drill.

522
00:39:19,837 --> 00:39:21,677
Abandon ship for this?

523
00:39:21,757 --> 00:39:24,077
Does that make any sense?

524
00:39:24,156 --> 00:39:25,597
Let's go. Come on.

525
00:39:25,676 --> 00:39:27,556
Everyone through the rear door!

526
00:39:27,636 --> 00:39:29,995
- We've got to find Drew.
- We'll find her, sweetheart.

527
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:32,475
- She can't hear this!
- I know. We'll find her.

528
00:39:33,395 --> 00:39:34,756
No. No, Frank.

529
00:39:34,836 --> 00:39:37,996
No, I have a feeling about this.
Come on.

530
00:39:38,076 --> 00:39:39,355
Outside, to the muster deck.

531
00:39:39,435 --> 00:39:40,795
Let's go. Follow me.

532
00:39:40,875 --> 00:39:42,875
Yes, please keep moving.

533
00:39:46,234 --> 00:39:48,075
- Sulphur.
- What?

534
00:39:48,154 --> 00:39:50,354
- You smell sulphur?
- What do you mean?

535
00:39:50,434 --> 00:39:52,154
Sulphur out of that vent.

536
00:39:52,235 --> 00:39:54,354
I swear I am never leaving the house again.

537
00:39:54,435 --> 00:39:57,074
Calmly go
immediately to the lifeboat stations.

538
00:39:57,154 --> 00:39:58,754
All hands evacuate.

539
00:39:58,834 --> 00:40:00,153
Engineers and electricians,...

540
00:40:00,234 --> 00:40:01,714
..abandon your posts...

541
00:40:01,793 --> 00:40:04,673
..and assist passengers
at your lifeboat assignment.

542
00:40:11,953 --> 00:40:13,753
This way, ladies and gentlemen!

543
00:40:13,833 --> 00:40:16,753
Please hurry! Please hurry!

544
00:40:21,432 --> 00:40:22,591
Everybody, hang on!

545
00:40:22,672 --> 00:40:24,071
Go!

546
00:40:38,631 --> 00:40:39,750
Hey, no!

547
00:40:39,831 --> 00:40:40,791
No! The doors!

548
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:41,870
Let me out!

549
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:43,070
This door won't open!

550
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:44,070
Let me in there!

551
00:40:56,069 --> 00:40:57,349
Come on.

552
00:40:58,629 --> 00:40:59,949
This way. Quickly.

553
00:41:00,029 --> 00:41:01,469
Ask him, Rupert, ask him!

554
00:41:01,548 --> 00:41:03,349
Look,
I've got to speak to someone in charge!

555
00:41:03,429 --> 00:41:04,749
He's loading the lifeboats.

556
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:06,709
You're gonna miss them if we don't hurry.

557
00:41:07,949 --> 00:41:09,828
Mum!

558
00:41:14,348 --> 00:41:15,948
Ugh!

559
00:41:17,347 --> 00:41:18,268
Oh, God.

560
00:41:19,348 --> 00:41:21,268
Push away from the ship!

561
00:41:21,348 --> 00:41:23,467
You know what?
I wanna chase something down.

562
00:41:23,548 --> 00:41:24,748
What are you doing?

563
00:41:24,827 --> 00:41:26,347
It seems odd.

564
00:41:26,427 --> 00:41:28,147
They're abandoning ship
in the middle of night.

565
00:41:28,227 --> 00:41:30,547
I'll be right back. Go. Follow the crew.

566
00:41:30,626 --> 00:41:31,866
Uh, no. Alex!

567
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:33,786
Follow the crew. I'll be right back.

568
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:35,426
No! Jeez!

569
00:41:36,386 --> 00:41:38,185
Watch your step, ma'am.

570
00:41:38,266 --> 00:41:40,226
Please, please stay seated.

571
00:41:41,466 --> 00:41:42,746
Sorry. Sorry.

572
00:41:42,826 --> 00:41:44,186
Watch your step!

573
00:41:44,265 --> 00:41:45,505
This way!

574
00:41:59,625 --> 00:42:00,904
Huh?

575
00:42:00,985 --> 00:42:02,864
Christ. He's locked us out.

576
00:42:10,823 --> 00:42:12,384
Sir, get yourself to a lifeboat!

577
00:42:12,463 --> 00:42:14,304
Take it easy, man. I'm LAPD.

578
00:42:14,384 --> 00:42:15,943
What? You're what?

579
00:42:16,024 --> 00:42:17,664
What is that?

580
00:42:17,744 --> 00:42:20,063
Have any of these fires been confirmed?

581
00:42:20,143 --> 00:42:22,942
We're loading the lifeboats, sir.

582
00:42:23,023 --> 00:42:25,262
Do you need more confirmation than that?

583
00:42:25,343 --> 00:42:26,423
Yeah.

584
00:42:53,061 --> 00:42:55,381
Last boat! Everybody goes right now!

585
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:57,340
Everybody, into the boat!

586
00:42:57,421 --> 00:42:58,780
That way, folks! Quickly!

587
00:42:58,860 --> 00:42:59,859
Come on, come on.

588
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:01,340
Drew.

589
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:02,940
Help us, somebody!

590
00:43:03,019 --> 00:43:04,659
Drew wasn't in the room.

591
00:43:04,739 --> 00:43:05,939
Celeste, we have looked everywhere!

592
00:43:06,019 --> 00:43:07,659
You guys,
she's probably on another lifeboat.

593
00:43:07,739 --> 00:43:08,939
But we can't leave without her!

594
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:10,059
Come on.

595
00:43:10,139 --> 00:43:11,099
I'm sure she's fine.

596
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:13,459
Come on, let's go! Let's go!

597
00:43:13,539 --> 00:43:16,258
Celeste, there isn't time.
Drew's gotten on another boat.

598
00:43:17,338 --> 00:43:19,459
Who's the officer?

599
00:43:19,538 --> 00:43:21,258
I wanna see my sister!

600
00:43:21,338 --> 00:43:22,457
Go, go, go, go!

601
00:43:25,258 --> 00:43:27,258
Alex, come on! It's the last boat!

602
00:43:27,338 --> 00:43:29,458
Come on, sir, we gotta move!

603
00:43:29,538 --> 00:43:30,538
Move it! Quickly!

604
00:43:30,618 --> 00:43:33,258
- Did you find Drew?
- She's not on the boat.

605
00:43:33,337 --> 00:43:34,137
Did someone run a count?

606
00:43:34,217 --> 00:43:36,137
She's probably on another boat, sir.

607
00:43:36,217 --> 00:43:37,337
Now, just get on, OK?

608
00:43:37,417 --> 00:43:39,297
About these fires. Something's strange.

609
00:43:39,376 --> 00:43:41,897
Your board's lit up.
This is sulphur-based smoke.

610
00:43:41,976 --> 00:43:43,937
- It makes no sense.
- Alex, come on.

611
00:43:44,017 --> 00:43:46,577
I can only lower the boat
when the ship isn't moving.

612
00:43:46,656 --> 00:43:48,056
I've got no time left,...

613
00:43:48,137 --> 00:43:49,936
..and I don't know
what this guy is capable of!

614
00:43:50,017 --> 00:43:52,776
What guy? What guy?!

615
00:44:05,176 --> 00:44:06,975
We're on our way.

616
00:44:15,974 --> 00:44:17,413
Oh, my God!
The boat is moving!

617
00:44:20,814 --> 00:44:22,534
What is happening?

618
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:27,533
Annie, jump!

619
00:44:27,614 --> 00:44:29,932
We have to bring it back up!

620
00:44:30,013 --> 00:44:31,133
Hold on to the rails!

621
00:44:33,413 --> 00:44:35,172
Ensign, what's going on?

622
00:44:35,252 --> 00:44:36,932
The winch must be jammed!

623
00:44:44,532 --> 00:44:46,532
We gotta stop the ship!

624
00:44:46,612 --> 00:44:49,451
I don't have any control!
Now get out of the way!

625
00:44:58,731 --> 00:45:00,451
What..? What...?

626
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:01,771
What are you doing?

627
00:45:01,850 --> 00:45:03,250
That cable will never hold,...

628
00:45:03,331 --> 00:45:05,130
..and we've got to get them out.

629
00:45:05,211 --> 00:45:07,570
What do you mean, we? Alex?

630
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:16,450
- OK.
- You got it?

631
00:45:18,769 --> 00:45:20,009
Be careful.

632
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:22,329
I'll be right back.

633
00:45:22,408 --> 00:45:23,969
OK.

634
00:45:51,327 --> 00:45:53,367
What the hell is he doing?!

635
00:45:53,447 --> 00:45:55,606
He said he'd be right back!

636
00:46:01,726 --> 00:46:04,046
We better get that end back up!

637
00:46:04,125 --> 00:46:06,126
If it hits the water on that angle,...

638
00:46:06,206 --> 00:46:07,206
..it'll collapse!

639
00:46:08,166 --> 00:46:09,126
Don't move!

640
00:46:09,205 --> 00:46:10,285
Please!

641
00:46:10,366 --> 00:46:12,325
Please pull us up!

642
00:46:12,405 --> 00:46:13,645
We're trying.

643
00:46:13,725 --> 00:46:15,925
Stay calm and keep the weight balanced.

644
00:46:16,005 --> 00:46:18,164
We'll bring you up one by one.

645
00:46:19,325 --> 00:46:20,844
She's still there!

646
00:46:20,924 --> 00:46:22,723
I know she's still on the ship!

647
00:46:22,804 --> 00:46:24,165
Celeste, where are you going?!

648
00:46:24,244 --> 00:46:26,124
No, no, no! Don't climb out!

649
00:46:26,205 --> 00:46:27,124
Don't... Don't move!

650
00:46:27,204 --> 00:46:28,404
It'll fall!

651
00:46:41,963 --> 00:46:43,763
Oh.

652
00:46:47,003 --> 00:46:49,083
Throw me a rope! I need to attach...

653
00:46:49,162 --> 00:46:51,642
Oh, sweetheart, it's not your fault.

654
00:46:51,722 --> 00:46:55,122
OK. Oh, here. OK.

655
00:46:55,201 --> 00:46:56,841
Watch out!

656
00:46:56,922 --> 00:46:59,521
Now, get the rope! Grab the rope!

657
00:46:59,601 --> 00:47:01,042
I'll get it!

658
00:47:01,122 --> 00:47:02,121
Careful!

659
00:47:03,321 --> 00:47:05,121
I got the rope!

660
00:47:05,201 --> 00:47:07,121
Tie it up to the hull!

661
00:47:07,201 --> 00:47:08,720
Pull the slack!

662
00:47:08,801 --> 00:47:10,240
Be careful!

663
00:47:10,321 --> 00:47:11,600
OK!

664
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,440
Whoa! Whoa! Aah!

665
00:47:17,561 --> 00:47:18,720
Whoa! Whoa!

666
00:47:18,801 --> 00:47:20,440
Hold on! Pull them up!

667
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:23,120
Whoa!

668
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,080
Aagh!

669
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,519
Help!

670
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,480
Alex! Alex!

671
00:47:27,559 --> 00:47:29,399
Dante!

672
00:47:30,359 --> 00:47:33,119
Help! Help!

673
00:47:38,119 --> 00:47:40,518
Help! Help!

674
00:47:42,598 --> 00:47:43,918
Oh! Help!

675
00:47:43,999 --> 00:47:45,118
Help!

676
00:47:52,197 --> 00:47:53,238
Come on.

677
00:47:53,318 --> 00:47:55,438
Pull me up, please! Pull!

678
00:47:55,517 --> 00:47:57,957
Alex! God. Yes, you are nuts.

679
00:47:58,037 --> 00:48:00,317
- Come on. Pull me up.
- I got you.

680
00:48:00,397 --> 00:48:01,397
Please pull!

681
00:48:02,997 --> 00:48:04,316
Get another line!

682
00:48:04,397 --> 00:48:05,836
Quickly! Get another line!

683
00:48:08,316 --> 00:48:11,437
There has to be something else!

684
00:48:12,596 --> 00:48:14,916
The gangplank! Get the gangplank!

685
00:48:32,915 --> 00:48:36,314
Alex. Alex, Alex.

686
00:48:36,394 --> 00:48:38,233
Hi, uh...

687
00:48:38,314 --> 00:48:40,833
Get everybody on here if you can.

688
00:48:41,834 --> 00:48:42,954
OK.

689
00:48:43,913 --> 00:48:45,913
OK. Thanks, man.

690
00:48:45,993 --> 00:48:48,513
Thank you. OK, thanks.

691
00:48:48,594 --> 00:48:49,593
OK.

692
00:49:23,191 --> 00:49:24,230
Thank you.

693
00:49:24,311 --> 00:49:26,830
That's the last one, sir.

694
00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:31,110
Officer, it's Merced.

695
00:49:31,190 --> 00:49:33,270
- Yes?

696
00:49:33,350 --> 00:49:35,509
We have a situation on the bridge.

697
00:49:35,589 --> 00:49:37,429
I bet we do!

698
00:49:37,509 --> 00:49:38,869
Keep everybody together, Rudy.

699
00:49:38,949 --> 00:49:40,309
I'll be on the bridge.

700
00:49:40,390 --> 00:49:42,430
Stay with the passengers.

701
00:49:57,068 --> 00:49:58,308
It's the radar.

702
00:49:58,388 --> 00:50:00,588
First I thought this was a heavy fog bank,
but it's not moving.

703
00:50:04,748 --> 00:50:06,667
Saint Martin.

704
00:50:06,747 --> 00:50:09,386
Well, there is a harbour on Saint Martin.

705
00:50:09,467 --> 00:50:11,346
He must be stopping us on the island.

706
00:50:11,426 --> 00:50:13,826
What's the heading?

707
00:50:13,906 --> 00:50:17,867
It is full at southeast 165.

708
00:50:17,946 --> 00:50:19,546
You think that's where he's taking us?

709
00:50:19,627 --> 00:50:21,267
You think that's the harbour?

710
00:50:25,746 --> 00:50:29,145
He's taking us to the cliffs
next to the harbour.

711
00:50:31,825 --> 00:50:34,345
He's gonna slam us into a wall.

712
00:50:34,425 --> 00:50:36,225
How long before we hit?

713
00:50:36,305 --> 00:50:38,145
Sir, get back with the other passengers.

714
00:50:38,225 --> 00:50:39,625
How much time have we got?

715
00:50:39,704 --> 00:50:40,545
I'm the first officer on this ship, OK,...

716
00:50:40,625 --> 00:50:41,584
..and you're...

717
00:50:41,665 --> 00:50:45,344
You've lost control of autopilot,
so there's got to be a hard wire link.

718
00:50:45,424 --> 00:50:46,824
Yes, that's exactly right, sir.

719
00:50:46,904 --> 00:50:49,983
But he's running it all by remote,
and there's nothing you can do.

720
00:50:50,064 --> 00:50:52,184
We gotta find the transmitter.

721
00:50:52,264 --> 00:50:54,264
So how's he transmitting the fires?!

722
00:50:54,344 --> 00:50:56,463
The fires don't exist. They're not real.

723
00:50:56,544 --> 00:50:58,423
Smoke canisters. Stun grenades.

724
00:50:58,503 --> 00:50:59,863
Probably put them in the air ducts.

725
00:50:59,943 --> 00:51:01,182
They're small.

726
00:51:01,263 --> 00:51:02,822
They roll,...

727
00:51:02,903 --> 00:51:04,182
..like...

728
00:51:04,263 --> 00:51:05,503
..these.

729
00:51:08,302 --> 00:51:09,343
Golf balls.

730
00:51:09,423 --> 00:51:11,823
Golf balls, golf balls.

731
00:51:12,742 --> 00:51:14,622
Geiger. Let's go get him right now.

732
00:51:14,703 --> 00:51:16,542
Get his cabin number.
We'll get him. I'll get him.

733
00:51:16,621 --> 00:51:17,462
We're locked out.

734
00:51:17,542 --> 00:51:18,582
Where are the skeet guns?

735
00:51:18,661 --> 00:51:20,021
Right here.

736
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:39,619
- Ow.

737
00:51:46,499 --> 00:51:48,340
Aagh!

738
00:51:48,419 --> 00:51:50,260
Why's everyone trying to kill me?!

739
00:51:52,419 --> 00:51:53,779
What happened? Are you OK?

740
00:51:53,859 --> 00:51:54,738
Ow. Ow.

741
00:51:54,819 --> 00:51:56,339
Stay down, stay down.

742
00:51:56,418 --> 00:51:58,659
You're OK.

743
00:51:58,738 --> 00:52:02,457
I can't override it.
He's changed all the access codes.

744
00:52:09,098 --> 00:52:11,178
We have a very sick boy.

745
00:52:11,257 --> 00:52:12,138
Exactly.

746
00:52:12,217 --> 00:52:16,417
Do you think I'd be doing this,
if I still had my health?

747
00:52:16,497 --> 00:52:17,937
It ends now.

748
00:52:18,016 --> 00:52:19,577
I know who you are.

749
00:52:19,656 --> 00:52:21,737
I know you, too.

750
00:52:21,817 --> 00:52:23,617
You look a little wet.

751
00:52:23,697 --> 00:52:25,417
You see, Alex,...

752
00:52:25,497 --> 00:52:28,336
..l designed this whole autopilot system.

753
00:52:28,416 --> 00:52:31,736
My company sold it off to almost
every shipping line in the world,...

754
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:35,416
..but when I got sick, they fired me.

755
00:52:36,815 --> 00:52:39,616
I had no defence. They just threw me away.

756
00:52:39,696 --> 00:52:43,295
But now I have
a more aggressive defence system.

757
00:52:44,455 --> 00:52:46,015
Tell me, Alex,...

758
00:52:46,095 --> 00:52:49,934
..did you ever have
a false sense of security?

759
00:52:55,454 --> 00:52:56,414
Aagh!

760
00:52:59,534 --> 00:53:02,174
Everybody, to the deck!

761
00:53:02,253 --> 00:53:03,453
Go! Go! Go!

762
00:53:05,734 --> 00:53:07,453
Nothing's secure, Alex.

763
00:53:12,812 --> 00:53:13,853
That was odd.

764
00:53:13,932 --> 00:53:15,533
You call that odd?
What kind of cop are you?

765
00:53:15,613 --> 00:53:16,933
You're gonna get us all killed!

766
00:53:17,013 --> 00:53:18,612
No, that's his plan.

767
00:53:18,693 --> 00:53:20,613
Where's engine control?

768
00:53:20,692 --> 00:53:22,012
What? Engine control?

769
00:53:22,093 --> 00:53:23,532
We're gonna stop the ship,
then we're gonna get him.

770
00:53:23,612 --> 00:53:24,811
I want you on the upper deck
with the other passengers!

771
00:53:24,892 --> 00:53:26,331
Fine! I'll find it on my own!

772
00:53:26,412 --> 00:53:27,411
Merced, go with him!

773
00:53:27,492 --> 00:53:29,331
Sir, he's highly irrational.

774
00:53:29,411 --> 00:53:31,251
You're an officer on this ship.

775
00:53:31,331 --> 00:53:33,732
Now, make sure he doesn't touch a thing!

776
00:53:34,691 --> 00:53:37,051
Ashton, you OK? Come on, get up.

777
00:53:37,211 --> 00:53:38,531
Keep it moving.

778
00:53:38,611 --> 00:53:41,171
Annie. They won't organize a search,...

779
00:53:41,251 --> 00:53:43,210
..but I know Drew didn't get away.

780
00:53:43,290 --> 00:53:45,130
She's got to be here somewhere!

781
00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:48,010
- They'll find her.
- Just keep it moving.

782
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:50,530
This way!

783
00:53:50,611 --> 00:53:52,330
Hello, miss. This way.

784
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:56,329
Dante, stop it.
Do you hear that? Listen.

785
00:53:56,410 --> 00:53:58,129
Yeah,
I hear something coming from down there.

786
00:53:58,210 --> 00:53:59,649
Where? Show me. Come on.

787
00:53:59,729 --> 00:54:02,089
- Harder!

788
00:54:02,169 --> 00:54:04,129
Can anybody hear?! Hello!

789
00:54:04,208 --> 00:54:05,808
Alejandro, I don't like this.

790
00:54:05,889 --> 00:54:07,409
I really don't like this.

791
00:54:07,488 --> 00:54:09,329
It's coming from down here somewhere.

792
00:54:10,928 --> 00:54:12,089
Anyone!

793
00:54:14,009 --> 00:54:14,928
Hello!

794
00:54:16,808 --> 00:54:18,247
Is anybody in there?!

795
00:54:18,328 --> 00:54:19,808
Yes!

796
00:54:19,887 --> 00:54:21,207
Yes, we're trapped!

797
00:54:21,287 --> 00:54:23,607
Get us the hell out of here!

798
00:54:23,687 --> 00:54:24,567
We're trying!

799
00:54:24,647 --> 00:54:26,927
Is there a little girl in there? Drew?

800
00:54:27,008 --> 00:54:29,127
No! Just big women!

801
00:54:29,207 --> 00:54:30,367
Excuse me!

802
00:54:30,447 --> 00:54:33,126
I mean, normal-sized women!
Come on, get us out of here!

803
00:54:34,326 --> 00:54:36,446
Oh, my God,
there's smoke coming out of the vent!

804
00:54:36,526 --> 00:54:37,926
Everybody get back!

805
00:54:38,006 --> 00:54:39,806
It's coming out everywhere!

806
00:54:39,885 --> 00:54:40,806
Ow. We're trying.

807
00:54:40,886 --> 00:54:42,645
Try to block the vent!

808
00:54:42,725 --> 00:54:43,886
Don't worry. We'll get you out!

809
00:55:03,645 --> 00:55:05,525
What are you doing?

810
00:55:05,604 --> 00:55:07,324
They told us to block the vents.

811
00:55:07,404 --> 00:55:08,244
She's right.

812
00:55:08,324 --> 00:55:09,844
I'll help you, lady.

813
00:55:09,924 --> 00:55:11,324
Alejandro, qué pasa?

814
00:55:11,403 --> 00:55:13,843
This smoke's gonna kill us off.

815
00:55:13,924 --> 00:55:15,323
Everybody just hang on!

816
00:55:15,403 --> 00:55:16,723
We'll get you out in a second!

817
00:55:16,803 --> 00:55:18,203
Help me, Harvey!

818
00:55:18,282 --> 00:55:20,243
I'm trying to save your life!

819
00:55:20,323 --> 00:55:21,723
Just hang on!

820
00:55:21,803 --> 00:55:23,163
OK. What is this?

821
00:55:23,243 --> 00:55:24,403
Try that.

822
00:55:24,483 --> 00:55:29,042
- This... this won't work.
- Just try it. I'll find something else.

823
00:55:31,922 --> 00:55:34,602
I told you this won't work!

824
00:55:36,201 --> 00:55:38,522
It's coming out everywhere.
Harv, give me your pants!

825
00:55:38,602 --> 00:55:40,842
My pants?!
No-one else is taking off their pants.

826
00:55:40,922 --> 00:55:42,042
I took off mine.

827
00:55:42,121 --> 00:55:44,721
Why hasn't she taken anything off yet?

828
00:55:44,801 --> 00:55:47,441
Cos I'm not wearing any underwear,
Harvey.

829
00:55:48,521 --> 00:55:50,001
Oh.

830
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:52,160
I can't breathe.

831
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,119
Come on, hurry up!

832
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:55,441
Come on!

833
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:00,800
What do we have?

834
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:08,999
Yeah, this'll do.

835
00:56:13,879 --> 00:56:15,399
This will do.

836
00:56:16,679 --> 00:56:19,558
Did you try
to close the fuel tanks manually?

837
00:56:19,639 --> 00:56:23,198
Yeah, but he's sealed off
all access to engine room four.

838
00:56:26,477 --> 00:56:27,918
Which of these controls the autopilot?

839
00:56:27,997 --> 00:56:29,798
I don't know. I'm the navigator.

840
00:56:29,877 --> 00:56:31,717
I'm not familiar with this equipment.

841
00:56:31,798 --> 00:56:33,118
Oh, you're not familiar?

842
00:56:33,198 --> 00:56:34,197
I see.

843
00:56:35,437 --> 00:56:36,797
Are you, uh...

844
00:56:36,877 --> 00:56:38,317
..familiar with this?

845
00:56:44,076 --> 00:56:45,756
Sir, this is Merced in engine control!

846
00:56:45,836 --> 00:56:47,796
He's smashing up all the equipment!

847
00:56:47,876 --> 00:56:49,316
Do you copy?

848
00:56:49,397 --> 00:56:51,356
Which of these
is not hooked up to the computer?

849
00:56:51,437 --> 00:56:53,796
There's plenty
not hooked up to the computer...

850
00:56:53,876 --> 00:56:55,716
..but nothing that overrides his programme.

851
00:56:55,795 --> 00:56:57,636
Then we have to fool his programme.

852
00:56:57,715 --> 00:56:59,955
We cannot stop the ship.

853
00:57:00,035 --> 00:57:01,595
I wanna slow it down.

854
00:57:01,675 --> 00:57:03,114
What you gonna do now?

855
00:57:03,195 --> 00:57:05,515
You gonna let the air out of our tyres?

856
00:57:05,594 --> 00:57:07,635
- What are these switches?
- Don't you touch them!

857
00:57:07,715 --> 00:57:10,635
They open the ballast doors!
You wanna flood the ship?!

858
00:57:12,834 --> 00:57:15,954
Sir, this is Merced! Does anybody copy?

859
00:57:16,034 --> 00:57:17,394
Hello? Somebody answer me!

860
00:57:17,474 --> 00:57:20,033
We're gonna flood the ship like you said.

861
00:57:20,114 --> 00:57:21,913
What are you talking about?

862
00:57:21,994 --> 00:57:23,313
Might slow her down.

863
00:57:23,393 --> 00:57:25,234
Right, you shut up!
You shut your mouth!

864
00:57:25,314 --> 00:57:26,714
I never said that!

865
00:57:26,793 --> 00:57:28,593
If we take on too much water,...

866
00:57:28,673 --> 00:57:30,513
..we'll all go down.

867
00:57:30,593 --> 00:57:31,873
Sir! Somebody answer me!

868
00:57:31,953 --> 00:57:33,233
Listen...

869
00:57:36,832 --> 00:57:38,792
Flood it.

870
00:57:47,272 --> 00:57:48,912
It's not working!

871
00:57:49,032 --> 00:57:50,112
Will you hurry up?!

872
00:57:51,232 --> 00:57:53,551
Wait. Dante, I think I've got something.

873
00:57:53,631 --> 00:57:54,711
Whoa.

874
00:57:54,791 --> 00:57:56,311
Everybody, back off!

875
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:57,910
Hurry up! Hurry up!

876
00:57:57,991 --> 00:57:59,191
Yeah, we found the key.

877
00:58:00,231 --> 00:58:01,031
What?

878
00:58:20,629 --> 00:58:21,790
OK, OK.

879
00:58:21,869 --> 00:58:23,749
Kick. Can you kick it?

880
00:58:23,829 --> 00:58:25,509
Look out!

881
00:58:25,588 --> 00:58:27,908
- Aagh!

882
00:58:27,989 --> 00:58:29,388
Can you get out?

883
00:58:30,388 --> 00:58:31,708
Can you guys get out?

884
00:58:31,788 --> 00:58:34,387
If you'll back off with the saw.

885
00:58:34,468 --> 00:58:35,388
What?!

886
00:58:35,468 --> 00:58:39,748
If you'll back off with the saw,
we'll give it a try!

887
00:58:39,828 --> 00:58:42,588
Oh, sorry! I'm sorry. Sorry.

888
00:58:48,787 --> 00:58:50,106
How much longer?

889
00:58:50,187 --> 00:58:52,986
I've never let a million gallons of water
into a ship before.

890
00:58:53,067 --> 00:58:54,387
Give me a second.

891
00:58:54,467 --> 00:58:58,626
I've got three watertight doors to close...

892
00:58:58,707 --> 00:59:01,666
..and I've got to shut off
these sensors as well.

893
00:59:02,785 --> 00:59:04,906
Where's this?

894
00:59:04,985 --> 00:59:06,345
That's the ballast room.

895
00:59:06,426 --> 00:59:08,585
That's right underneath us.

896
00:59:08,665 --> 00:59:10,946
That's what we're flooding.

897
00:59:14,185 --> 00:59:16,105
All right, watertight doors are closed.

898
00:59:16,185 --> 00:59:17,905
Ballast doors should open any minute.

899
00:59:17,985 --> 00:59:19,905
Shit!

900
00:59:19,984 --> 00:59:21,825
Close it! Close it!

901
00:59:21,904 --> 00:59:24,144
You just told me to open them!

902
00:59:34,303 --> 00:59:35,783
Follow me.

903
00:59:49,582 --> 00:59:53,582
I can't close it just like that.

904
00:59:54,782 --> 00:59:57,222
Don't let go of me!

905
01:00:53,857 --> 01:00:57,096
Hold on! Hold on!

906
01:00:57,177 --> 01:00:59,657
I'll... I'll hold on.

907
01:01:23,615 --> 01:01:24,975
You OK?

908
01:01:25,054 --> 01:01:26,574
You're gonna be fine.

909
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:27,855
Hmm. Huh?

910
01:01:29,895 --> 01:01:31,694
In case anything happens...

911
01:01:31,774 --> 01:01:33,534
..to us,...

912
01:01:33,615 --> 01:01:35,535
..you want me to know that...

913
01:01:35,614 --> 01:01:38,295
..you... you...

914
01:01:38,374 --> 01:01:39,814
..love me...

915
01:01:41,174 --> 01:01:44,053
..and that you're gonna be 15 next month.

916
01:01:48,052 --> 01:01:50,372
Relationships
based on extreme circumstances,...

917
01:01:50,453 --> 01:01:52,453
..they rarely work out.

918
01:02:02,252 --> 01:02:03,692
This way, everybody!

919
01:02:03,772 --> 01:02:06,491
What's going on?
Why has the evacuation stopped?

920
01:02:06,571 --> 01:02:09,011
Stopped? We didn't even start.

921
01:02:09,091 --> 01:02:10,532
Are we sinking? Are we gonna die?

922
01:02:10,612 --> 01:02:13,331
- The important thing is to stay calm.
- You don't even work here!

923
01:02:13,412 --> 01:02:17,291
I've been in worse situations than this
and panicking does not help.

924
01:02:17,371 --> 01:02:19,010
We have our life vests.
We can jump off the ship.

925
01:02:19,091 --> 01:02:21,411
You'd get sucked into the propellers.

926
01:02:21,490 --> 01:02:24,050
Yeah, that would suck.

927
01:02:26,170 --> 01:02:27,970
Alex.

928
01:02:28,051 --> 01:02:29,691
Oh, my God. Drew.

929
01:02:29,770 --> 01:02:30,771
Where you been, huh?

930
01:02:31,810 --> 01:02:34,490
- Is she OK?
- We'll find your mum.

931
01:02:34,569 --> 01:02:35,490
She all right?

932
01:02:35,569 --> 01:02:36,410
Yeah.

933
01:02:37,449 --> 01:02:38,729
Come on, sweetheart.

934
01:02:38,809 --> 01:02:39,689
You OK?

935
01:02:39,769 --> 01:02:41,208
Yeah, I'm fine. What's happening?

936
01:02:41,289 --> 01:02:42,688
Why did the ship start up again?

937
01:02:42,769 --> 01:02:44,569
Why... why did you leave me upstairs?

938
01:02:47,569 --> 01:02:49,328
We have a situation.

939
01:02:49,409 --> 01:02:51,528
I know we have a situation. What?

940
01:02:51,608 --> 01:02:53,209
Geiger's taken over the ship.

941
01:02:53,288 --> 01:02:56,087
Geiger.
I'm-not-looking-at-my-golf-game Geiger?

942
01:02:56,168 --> 01:02:59,487
No, Geiger I'm-a-computer-psycho,
Geiger l-designed-all-the-software,...

943
01:02:59,568 --> 01:03:01,327
..and Geiger l-can-blow-up-everything.

944
01:03:01,407 --> 01:03:02,808
- Why would he do that?
- I don't know.

945
01:03:02,888 --> 01:03:06,487
- Where is he?
- He's everywhere. Come up here.

946
01:03:09,887 --> 01:03:11,486
That's him.

947
01:03:11,567 --> 01:03:12,886
What?

948
01:03:12,967 --> 01:03:15,726
Go up to the top deck with everyone.

949
01:03:15,807 --> 01:03:17,606
You stay. You stay, and you wait.

950
01:03:17,686 --> 01:03:20,285
Hey, you don't have to save this ship.

951
01:03:55,403 --> 01:03:56,924
Freeze!

952
01:03:57,004 --> 01:03:58,963
Drop the weapon.

953
01:03:59,044 --> 01:04:00,923
Don't shoot.

954
01:04:01,003 --> 01:04:02,683
It's not a gun, it's just a computer.

955
01:04:02,763 --> 01:04:04,083
Drop it, asshole.

956
01:04:04,163 --> 01:04:05,082
Where's your friend Annie?

957
01:04:05,163 --> 01:04:07,122
She's cute.

958
01:04:07,202 --> 01:04:10,122
It would be a shame
if anything happened to her.

959
01:04:11,162 --> 01:04:12,521
Hit the floor now!

960
01:04:14,402 --> 01:04:16,522
I was just trying to make conversation.

961
01:04:16,602 --> 01:04:19,362
I'm putting it down now...

962
01:04:19,442 --> 01:04:21,242
..real slow.

963
01:05:02,953 --> 01:05:06,034
The irony of my situation, Alex,...

964
01:05:06,113 --> 01:05:07,592
..is that dedication to job...

965
01:05:07,673 --> 01:05:09,512
..and devotion to the company...

966
01:05:09,593 --> 01:05:11,793
..was repaid with a terminal illness.

967
01:05:14,872 --> 01:05:17,593
You see, computers
generate electromagnetic fields...

968
01:05:17,672 --> 01:05:19,072
..which, over time,...

969
01:05:19,152 --> 01:05:22,032
..can cause severe copper poisoning.

970
01:05:23,551 --> 01:05:25,871
I'm a smart guy, Alex,...

971
01:05:25,952 --> 01:05:28,272
..and even I didn't know that.

972
01:05:28,352 --> 01:05:30,511
I would have really appreciated...

973
01:05:30,591 --> 01:05:33,071
..some understanding
from upper management.

974
01:05:33,151 --> 01:05:34,031
OK, is everybody OK?

975
01:05:34,111 --> 01:05:34,991
We're fine.

976
01:05:35,071 --> 01:05:36,672
But, no. They dropped me.

977
01:05:38,311 --> 01:05:40,271
They treated me like I never existed.

978
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:41,471
Where are you going?

979
01:05:41,551 --> 01:05:42,911
I'll go find him.

980
01:05:42,991 --> 01:05:44,671
Hang on. Wait!

981
01:05:44,751 --> 01:05:47,271
Now, I just gotta do whatever I can...

982
01:05:48,550 --> 01:05:51,271
..to get whatever I can get.

983
01:05:51,351 --> 01:05:53,629
You're not gonna stop me.

984
01:05:53,710 --> 01:05:56,750
This time it's goodbye for good, Alex.

985
01:06:10,349 --> 01:06:13,429
How you gonna stop me now, my friend?

986
01:06:29,908 --> 01:06:31,348
Damn it.

987
01:06:53,747 --> 01:06:54,666
Damn.

988
01:07:04,746 --> 01:07:07,266
Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

989
01:07:07,346 --> 01:07:08,986
I've heard that music before.

990
01:07:09,066 --> 01:07:10,866
They pipe it in all over the ship.

991
01:07:10,945 --> 01:07:12,985
No, no, no. I've heard this music before.

992
01:07:13,066 --> 01:07:15,466
Ship-shopping music. He's in the mall.

993
01:07:25,864 --> 01:07:27,185
There's a fire in there.

994
01:07:27,264 --> 01:07:28,185
Well, don't worry.

995
01:07:28,265 --> 01:07:29,945
The flames can't get past the fire doors.

996
01:07:42,864 --> 01:07:43,704
Alex.

997
01:07:43,784 --> 01:07:44,664
Alex, Alex.

998
01:07:44,744 --> 01:07:46,784
Don't touch that!

999
01:07:46,864 --> 01:07:49,263
OK, um, I need a... I need a...

1000
01:07:49,343 --> 01:07:51,783
I need my saw.

1001
01:07:51,863 --> 01:07:52,784
Alex! Alex!

1002
01:07:54,343 --> 01:07:55,703
Alex! Oh, God.

1003
01:07:55,784 --> 01:07:58,223
Don't touch anything. Don't touch anything!

1004
01:07:58,303 --> 01:07:59,822
I know where to release the fire doors.

1005
01:07:59,903 --> 01:08:01,583
Don't open the door. It's a trap.

1006
01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:02,583
There's something in the door.

1007
01:08:02,663 --> 01:08:04,102
Baby, we can't get in to you.

1008
01:08:04,182 --> 01:08:05,622
There's something in the door.

1009
01:08:05,703 --> 01:08:07,462
What does it look like?

1010
01:08:07,542 --> 01:08:08,902
Wait. What does is look like?

1011
01:08:08,983 --> 01:08:10,383
OK, it's green,...

1012
01:08:10,463 --> 01:08:12,262
..like a spray deodorant can.

1013
01:08:12,341 --> 01:08:14,382
I don't know. Can't think.

1014
01:08:14,462 --> 01:08:16,302
OK. It's a grenade.

1015
01:08:16,382 --> 01:08:17,382
What?

1016
01:08:17,462 --> 01:08:18,662
There's a number on it.

1017
01:08:18,742 --> 01:08:20,621
There should be a number on it.

1018
01:08:20,702 --> 01:08:23,822
Uh, OK, yeah. It's um... L-1619...

1019
01:08:23,901 --> 01:08:26,262
..uh... Magnum.

1020
01:08:26,342 --> 01:08:28,261
- Is the pin out?
- What?

1021
01:08:28,341 --> 01:08:29,421
Is the pin out?!

1022
01:08:29,501 --> 01:08:31,461
No, the pin's still in,
but it's attached to a wire.

1023
01:08:31,541 --> 01:08:32,701
Yeah.

1024
01:08:32,781 --> 01:08:35,460
Tie the spoon to the grenade.

1025
01:08:35,541 --> 01:08:36,461
Spoon? What?

1026
01:08:36,540 --> 01:08:37,861
With a string.

1027
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:39,261
Oh, baby, don't say grenade.

1028
01:08:39,341 --> 01:08:40,221
OK. A string.

1029
01:08:40,301 --> 01:08:42,300
Uh...

1030
01:08:42,380 --> 01:08:44,700
..your shoelace! Come on.

1031
01:08:44,780 --> 01:08:46,180
I got it.

1032
01:08:46,261 --> 01:08:47,101
That's it.

1033
01:08:47,180 --> 01:08:48,260
OK, all right.

1034
01:08:48,341 --> 01:08:49,220
OK.

1035
01:08:49,301 --> 01:08:51,500
OK, be real careful.

1036
01:08:54,860 --> 01:08:56,700
All right. Here it goes.

1037
01:08:56,780 --> 01:08:57,660
Uh...

1038
01:08:57,740 --> 01:08:59,099
..you gotta hurry up.

1039
01:08:59,179 --> 01:09:02,299
- OK, OK.

1040
01:09:03,860 --> 01:09:05,019
Got it. Got it.

1041
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:06,299
Got it. What now?

1042
01:09:06,378 --> 01:09:07,779
Pull the pin out...

1043
01:09:07,859 --> 01:09:09,459
..and remove the grenade.

1044
01:09:13,899 --> 01:09:16,379
Um, uh...

1045
01:09:16,458 --> 01:09:17,859
You pull out the pin,...

1046
01:09:17,938 --> 01:09:20,219
..and I will pull out the grenade.

1047
01:09:20,299 --> 01:09:22,498
OK. Counting. One,...

1048
01:09:22,578 --> 01:09:23,658
..two...

1049
01:09:23,738 --> 01:09:24,858
..three.

1050
01:09:27,338 --> 01:09:28,258
- Whoa!
- Aagh!

1051
01:09:31,977 --> 01:09:32,858
Where is it?

1052
01:09:32,937 --> 01:09:34,858
Where is it? Where is it?!

1053
01:09:34,938 --> 01:09:36,258
It's in your hand.

1054
01:09:36,336 --> 01:09:38,497
Huh?! Take it out. Take it out!

1055
01:09:38,577 --> 01:09:40,858
Take it out. Take it out. Got it? Take it.

1056
01:09:40,937 --> 01:09:42,017
I got it.

1057
01:09:42,098 --> 01:09:43,178
OK, got it?

1058
01:09:43,257 --> 01:09:45,257
Alex!

1059
01:09:46,697 --> 01:09:48,777
Uh, you can open the door now.

1060
01:09:48,856 --> 01:09:50,937
OK.

1061
01:10:03,936 --> 01:10:05,736
No.

1062
01:10:26,735 --> 01:10:28,655
Here's some more dry towels.

1063
01:10:28,734 --> 01:10:30,373
Thank you.

1064
01:10:30,454 --> 01:10:32,894
I am so sorry I yelled at you.

1065
01:10:32,974 --> 01:10:34,374
That's OK, Dad.

1066
01:10:34,454 --> 01:10:36,094
I'm OK.

1067
01:10:39,453 --> 01:10:41,574
OK.

1068
01:10:41,653 --> 01:10:44,374
Where's Alex?

1069
01:10:44,454 --> 01:10:45,892
"Where's Alex?"

1070
01:10:52,334 --> 01:10:53,732
Come over here.

1071
01:10:55,932 --> 01:10:57,893
Just sit down. Don't talk. Don't move.

1072
01:10:57,973 --> 01:11:00,213
- I'm OK.
- You're not OK.

1073
01:11:00,293 --> 01:11:01,852
Stop saying that, all right?

1074
01:11:01,932 --> 01:11:03,372
Are you OK?

1075
01:11:08,293 --> 01:11:09,571
I don't think so.

1076
01:11:09,652 --> 01:11:11,012
What?

1077
01:11:11,092 --> 01:11:12,452
He's adjusting starboard.

1078
01:11:12,532 --> 01:11:14,412
What does that mean?

1079
01:11:14,492 --> 01:11:16,851
Does that mean right, left,
round the island?

1080
01:11:16,931 --> 01:11:18,691
No. Right into the island.

1081
01:11:18,771 --> 01:11:20,092
We're moving again.

1082
01:11:20,171 --> 01:11:21,572
He's turning us half a degree starboard.

1083
01:11:21,651 --> 01:11:24,371
Come on, guys. We're getting closer.

1084
01:11:24,451 --> 01:11:28,051
OK, I'm cutting the serial port connection.

1085
01:11:28,131 --> 01:11:30,011
Anything?

1086
01:11:31,331 --> 01:11:33,650
No, we're still locked out.

1087
01:11:33,731 --> 01:11:35,530
Come on.

1088
01:11:36,530 --> 01:11:38,451
Hey, we're moving.

1089
01:11:38,531 --> 01:11:39,970
We have control again.

1090
01:11:40,050 --> 01:11:42,170
No, we're still dead here.

1091
01:11:42,250 --> 01:11:43,970
Are you sure, sir, because we're turning.

1092
01:11:44,050 --> 01:11:44,851
It's him.

1093
01:11:44,930 --> 01:11:46,450
It's him, it's him.

1094
01:11:46,530 --> 01:11:47,969
He's onboard. Geiger's still onboard.

1095
01:11:48,049 --> 01:11:49,849
Guys, maybe these people can help.

1096
01:11:51,690 --> 01:11:52,970
Hand me those.

1097
01:11:53,050 --> 01:11:54,850
Right there.

1098
01:11:58,969 --> 01:12:01,569
He's taking us right into an oil tanker.

1099
01:12:02,529 --> 01:12:03,649
What?

1100
01:12:03,728 --> 01:12:04,968
You're right.

1101
01:12:05,049 --> 01:12:07,409
She's anchored 16 miles out,...

1102
01:12:07,489 --> 01:12:09,849
..and we are doing 17.8 knots.

1103
01:12:09,929 --> 01:12:11,408
Well, how long till they move?

1104
01:12:11,488 --> 01:12:13,888
From starting their engines, 30 minutes.

1105
01:12:13,968 --> 01:12:16,688
They won't get out of our way in time.

1106
01:12:16,768 --> 01:12:19,568
So, what... what... what does that mean?

1107
01:12:20,767 --> 01:12:22,608
Oh, man!

1108
01:12:22,688 --> 01:12:25,088
Uh, he's turning us another quarter.

1109
01:12:31,127 --> 01:12:33,447
Agh! Damn it.

1110
01:12:35,927 --> 01:12:37,487
Can we turn the ship without the rudder?

1111
01:12:37,567 --> 01:12:39,447
The bow thrusters would do it.

1112
01:12:39,527 --> 01:12:40,808
We can't get there now.

1113
01:12:40,887 --> 01:12:42,567
You guys flooded the access.

1114
01:12:42,646 --> 01:12:44,286
We also messed up his programme, sir.

1115
01:12:44,367 --> 01:12:46,366
No, you almost sunk us.

1116
01:12:46,447 --> 01:12:48,367
Oh! Oh, oh, oh!

1117
01:12:48,447 --> 01:12:50,766
Let's take a wrench
and dump it into the engine...

1118
01:12:50,846 --> 01:12:52,646
..and bust the transmission like a car,...

1119
01:12:52,726 --> 01:12:54,206
..cos I've done that.

1120
01:12:54,287 --> 01:12:56,406
With all due respect, this is not your car.

1121
01:12:56,486 --> 01:12:57,765
This is a cruise liner.

1122
01:12:57,846 --> 01:12:58,766
She's right. It's a propeller.

1123
01:12:58,845 --> 01:13:00,286
We got to stop the propeller.

1124
01:13:00,365 --> 01:13:02,685
You could wedge something into it...

1125
01:13:02,766 --> 01:13:04,645
..like a... a steel cable.

1126
01:13:04,725 --> 01:13:06,845
This is not my suggestion, obviously.

1127
01:13:06,925 --> 01:13:09,045
Great idea. I'll go under the ship.

1128
01:13:09,126 --> 01:13:10,165
No, you won't.

1129
01:13:10,245 --> 01:13:12,285
No, you won't. That's not what I meant.

1130
01:13:12,364 --> 01:13:13,365
That's a stupid idea.

1131
01:13:13,444 --> 01:13:14,685
No, it's a great idea.

1132
01:13:14,765 --> 01:13:15,645
No.

1133
01:13:15,725 --> 01:13:17,845
It's suicide.
These blades are 12 feet across.

1134
01:13:17,925 --> 01:13:20,364
They'll suck you in and kill you.

1135
01:13:35,883 --> 01:13:37,683
Hey. Hey, Dino, I got one for you.

1136
01:13:37,763 --> 01:13:40,044
OK, who played the German captain...

1137
01:13:40,123 --> 01:13:41,444
..in The Enemy Below?

1138
01:13:41,524 --> 01:13:43,443
Curt Jurgens.

1139
01:13:51,723 --> 01:13:53,562
Down the next stairwell on the left,...

1140
01:13:53,643 --> 01:13:55,443
..straight to the bowels of the ship.

1141
01:13:55,523 --> 01:13:57,323
Bowels. That doesn't sound very good.

1142
01:13:58,921 --> 01:14:00,242
How much time left?

1143
01:14:00,322 --> 01:14:02,322
Not very much. We better hurry.

1144
01:14:03,362 --> 01:14:04,243
Mayday, Mayday.

1145
01:14:04,322 --> 01:14:05,682
This is Seabourn Legend...

1146
01:14:05,762 --> 01:14:07,881
..bearing 80 degrees east-northeast.

1147
01:14:07,962 --> 01:14:10,282
Engine and steering control nonfunctional.

1148
01:14:10,362 --> 01:14:11,762
I repeat. Nonfunctional.

1149
01:14:11,841 --> 01:14:13,202
Where are we going?

1150
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:14,281
Eindhoven Lion.

1151
01:14:14,361 --> 01:14:16,041
Eindhoven Lion, come in.

1152
01:14:16,121 --> 01:14:17,761
This is Seabourn Legend.

1153
01:14:17,841 --> 01:14:19,961
Eindhoven Lion, come in.

1154
01:14:20,042 --> 01:14:21,640
Eindhoven Lion, this is Seabourn Legend.

1155
01:14:21,721 --> 01:14:24,041
Come in, Eindhoven Lion.

1156
01:14:27,161 --> 01:14:28,960
This is the only way out.

1157
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:31,881
This all the diving gear?

1158
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:33,040
Yeah.

1159
01:14:33,121 --> 01:14:34,720
OK, here it goes.

1160
01:14:55,919 --> 01:14:56,920
Huh?

1161
01:15:04,118 --> 01:15:06,079
You think that ship's gonna rescue us?

1162
01:15:06,158 --> 01:15:07,159
What else could it be?

1163
01:15:07,238 --> 01:15:09,358
Alex, maybe this isn't such a hot idea.

1164
01:15:09,438 --> 01:15:11,678
Maybe you should just
leave the propeller alone, huh?

1165
01:15:11,759 --> 01:15:13,478
We have to stop the ship.

1166
01:15:14,838 --> 01:15:16,158
There's not much time left.

1167
01:15:18,838 --> 01:15:20,238
Are you sure this is gonna hold?

1168
01:15:20,317 --> 01:15:22,797
Yeah. We use those lines all over the ship.

1169
01:15:22,877 --> 01:15:24,357
He's not going all over the ship.

1170
01:15:24,437 --> 01:15:26,557
He's going under the ship, all right?

1171
01:15:26,637 --> 01:15:28,757
Annie, Annie. It's OK. It'll hold.

1172
01:15:36,517 --> 01:15:39,036
Hold on. Let me lock it.

1173
01:15:39,117 --> 01:15:40,357
All right.

1174
01:15:40,436 --> 01:15:42,036
Hey.

1175
01:15:50,516 --> 01:15:51,796
Annie.

1176
01:15:51,876 --> 01:15:53,556
What?

1177
01:15:53,635 --> 01:15:54,995
4296...

1178
01:15:55,076 --> 01:15:56,556
..589J.

1179
01:15:56,635 --> 01:15:58,675
I don't know what that is. What is that?

1180
01:15:58,756 --> 01:16:00,636
It's my badge number.

1181
01:16:00,715 --> 01:16:03,075
It's 4296589J.

1182
01:16:04,035 --> 01:16:05,835
Thank you.

1183
01:16:05,915 --> 01:16:07,716
I'll be right back.

1184
01:16:11,835 --> 01:16:13,195
Here's the guideline.

1185
01:16:13,275 --> 01:16:17,034
Feed it into the propeller,
and it will pull the heavy cable in.

1186
01:16:22,514 --> 01:16:23,635
Not too much slack.

1187
01:16:23,714 --> 01:16:24,833
OK, OK, OK. I've got him.

1188
01:16:38,113 --> 01:16:39,273
He's getting too close.

1189
01:16:39,353 --> 01:16:41,353
OK, OK, he's close enough.

1190
01:16:41,432 --> 01:16:42,753
Stop it now.

1191
01:16:53,353 --> 01:16:55,672
Come on, baby. Let it go.

1192
01:16:55,752 --> 01:16:56,912
Let it go.

1193
01:17:06,351 --> 01:17:09,351
It's taking the cable.
It's working. It's working!

1194
01:17:09,432 --> 01:17:11,591
Well, then let's get him up then, huh?

1195
01:17:11,671 --> 01:17:13,631
- Come on.
- Pull him back up.

1196
01:17:29,230 --> 01:17:30,071
It's stuck.

1197
01:17:30,150 --> 01:17:31,151
He's snagged.

1198
01:17:31,230 --> 01:17:33,430
The lines are crossed.
We have to bring him up.

1199
01:17:33,511 --> 01:17:35,469
Come on. Now. Do something!

1200
01:17:39,670 --> 01:17:40,550
It's sucking him in.

1201
01:17:40,630 --> 01:17:41,829
We gotta get him out of there!

1202
01:17:53,308 --> 01:17:54,309
18.

1203
01:17:55,909 --> 01:17:57,628
Come on, baby.

1204
01:17:57,708 --> 01:17:58,868
17.5.

1205
01:17:58,948 --> 01:18:00,348
They're doing it.

1206
01:18:00,429 --> 01:18:01,909
They're slowing us down.

1207
01:18:19,268 --> 01:18:21,307
Oh, no, you don't.

1208
01:18:31,266 --> 01:18:32,547
We gotta get him up.

1209
01:18:32,626 --> 01:18:35,786
Come on, come on. Keep pulling.

1210
01:18:35,866 --> 01:18:38,226
Pull.

1211
01:18:40,427 --> 01:18:41,667
Pull him up.

1212
01:18:41,746 --> 01:18:43,225
Keep pulling.

1213
01:18:44,666 --> 01:18:46,026
What the hell's happening?

1214
01:18:46,105 --> 01:18:47,065
It's stuck again!

1215
01:18:47,146 --> 01:18:48,946
Get him up! Get him up!

1216
01:18:49,026 --> 01:18:50,426
It's not gonna hold.

1217
01:18:55,745 --> 01:18:57,626
Oh! Won't go any faster.

1218
01:18:57,705 --> 01:18:59,625
Won't go any faster!

1219
01:19:04,465 --> 01:19:05,746
Watch out!

1220
01:19:09,025 --> 01:19:11,105
Get back! Aagh!

1221
01:19:22,823 --> 01:19:25,824
- I think I broke my arm.
- Alex! Alex!

1222
01:19:25,904 --> 01:19:27,144
Alex.

1223
01:19:27,223 --> 01:19:29,183
Come on. Hold on.

1224
01:19:29,263 --> 01:19:30,623
Come on. Hold on.

1225
01:19:30,703 --> 01:19:32,063
We've got him now.

1226
01:19:32,143 --> 01:19:33,983
Are you all right?

1227
01:19:34,064 --> 01:19:35,864
What happened?

1228
01:19:35,943 --> 01:19:37,542
I don't know, something just...

1229
01:19:37,623 --> 01:19:39,263
Let him go.

1230
01:19:39,342 --> 01:19:41,343
You slowed her down,...

1231
01:19:41,423 --> 01:19:43,743
..but you're not gonna stop her.

1232
01:19:43,823 --> 01:19:47,782
Annie, I don't think your boyfriend
appreciates the logistics involved...

1233
01:19:47,862 --> 01:19:50,263
..in ramming
the most automated ship in the world...

1234
01:19:50,342 --> 01:19:53,142
..into a loaded fuel tanker
with no set anchor path.

1235
01:19:53,221 --> 01:19:54,622
Let her go.

1236
01:19:54,701 --> 01:19:58,582
Maybe you can spend
the rest of your days in a mental hospital...

1237
01:19:58,662 --> 01:20:00,221
..sticking leeches to your ass.

1238
01:20:00,301 --> 01:20:02,621
Oh, so you met my nurses.

1239
01:20:02,701 --> 01:20:04,541
They clean the copper out of my blood.

1240
01:20:04,621 --> 01:20:07,542
Doctors gave me a couple of years to live!

1241
01:20:07,621 --> 01:20:09,781
Those bloodsuckers
might give me a few more.

1242
01:20:09,861 --> 01:20:12,341
You walk away now...

1243
01:20:12,421 --> 01:20:14,222
..and there's a chance I might not kill you.

1244
01:20:14,301 --> 01:20:16,180
Listen to you.

1245
01:20:16,261 --> 01:20:17,781
Let him go.

1246
01:20:17,860 --> 01:20:19,141
Now!

1247
01:20:19,220 --> 01:20:20,820
Go ahead.

1248
01:20:20,901 --> 01:20:21,940
Uh-uh.

1249
01:20:22,021 --> 01:20:23,220
Now!

1250
01:20:23,299 --> 01:20:24,539
Go ahead.

1251
01:20:26,300 --> 01:20:27,740
Oh.

1252
01:20:27,820 --> 01:20:28,820
Oh!

1253
01:20:33,020 --> 01:20:34,540
Mr Juliano,...

1254
01:20:34,619 --> 01:20:35,740
..we'll be getting off.

1255
01:20:35,819 --> 01:20:37,020
I hope you don't mind,...

1256
01:20:37,100 --> 01:20:38,418
..but I'll be taking Annie with me...

1257
01:20:38,499 --> 01:20:41,059
..as a little extra insurance.

1258
01:20:41,139 --> 01:20:43,939
You know the one-armed freestyle,
don't you?

1259
01:20:49,619 --> 01:20:52,819
Hey! Come on, or you'll join them!

1260
01:20:52,899 --> 01:20:53,938
This way.

1261
01:21:12,937 --> 01:21:14,018
Hold on, hold on.

1262
01:21:21,737 --> 01:21:24,137
I can't believe they can't see us.

1263
01:21:24,217 --> 01:21:25,896
How can they miss us?

1264
01:21:28,496 --> 01:21:29,856
I can't get her on the radio!

1265
01:21:29,937 --> 01:21:31,057
She's not responding.

1266
01:21:31,137 --> 01:21:32,976
She's closing in at 14 knots,...

1267
01:21:33,056 --> 01:21:35,376
..bearing 166.4.

1268
01:21:35,456 --> 01:21:36,936
She's heading straight into us.

1269
01:21:37,016 --> 01:21:38,456
Get the anchors up now!

1270
01:21:38,536 --> 01:21:39,416
Yes, sir!

1271
01:21:51,255 --> 01:21:53,135
Which way did they go?

1272
01:21:53,215 --> 01:21:55,295
The marina. He's going to jump ship.

1273
01:21:57,094 --> 01:21:58,415
You all right?

1274
01:21:58,495 --> 01:22:00,575
I'm OK.

1275
01:22:00,655 --> 01:22:02,215
Hurry up!

1276
01:22:06,494 --> 01:22:08,175
Get moving!

1277
01:22:08,254 --> 01:22:10,813
Get off of me! Get off of me!

1278
01:22:10,894 --> 01:22:12,694
Very physical, aren't we?

1279
01:22:22,454 --> 01:22:24,214
OK,...

1280
01:22:24,293 --> 01:22:25,813
..that way.

1281
01:22:25,894 --> 01:22:26,973
Down the stairs.

1282
01:22:27,052 --> 01:22:28,013
Hold it!

1283
01:22:35,012 --> 01:22:36,572
We're going for a little ride.

1284
01:22:36,652 --> 01:22:38,013
Come on.

1285
01:22:38,093 --> 01:22:40,173
Can't let you go now.
You're my little hostage.

1286
01:22:40,252 --> 01:22:41,133
Come on!

1287
01:22:41,212 --> 01:22:42,571
Don't touch me!

1288
01:22:42,652 --> 01:22:45,492
Get down. Get down!

1289
01:22:49,092 --> 01:22:50,331
All right.

1290
01:22:50,411 --> 01:22:51,892
That's it.

1291
01:22:53,492 --> 01:22:54,531
So...

1292
01:22:54,612 --> 01:22:55,692
..aw.

1293
01:22:56,692 --> 01:22:58,571
How do you like your vacation so far?

1294
01:22:58,651 --> 01:22:59,531
Sit down!

1295
01:22:59,611 --> 01:23:00,811
Ow.

1296
01:23:13,730 --> 01:23:15,650
You better hang on.

1297
01:23:22,690 --> 01:23:23,610
Annie!

1298
01:23:23,690 --> 01:23:26,410
Alex? Alex!

1299
01:23:30,250 --> 01:23:31,809
Need a hand?

1300
01:23:31,890 --> 01:23:33,049
Hold on. I got you.

1301
01:23:43,488 --> 01:23:48,089
I don't think
you want to be on that ship now, Annie.

1302
01:23:51,288 --> 01:23:52,528
Aagh!

1303
01:23:54,288 --> 01:23:55,208
You know your way around the ship?

1304
01:23:55,288 --> 01:23:56,208
Yeah.

1305
01:24:06,807 --> 01:24:07,807
You're OK?

1306
01:24:07,887 --> 01:24:09,407
What happened?

1307
01:24:10,528 --> 01:24:12,487
Alex, can you hear me?

1308
01:24:17,687 --> 01:24:19,247
I don't like this at all.

1309
01:24:19,327 --> 01:24:20,207
Oh, my God.

1310
01:24:20,287 --> 01:24:21,407
Jeez, we're coming in too fast!

1311
01:24:21,487 --> 01:24:25,286
How could this happen on our honeymoon?

1312
01:24:28,846 --> 01:24:30,726
Wait a minute.

1313
01:24:30,806 --> 01:24:33,246
Oh, my God. Why don't we stop?

1314
01:24:33,326 --> 01:24:34,726
Why don't we stop?

1315
01:24:34,806 --> 01:24:36,206
Everyone, move away from the windows!

1316
01:24:36,286 --> 01:24:37,245
Away from the windows!

1317
01:24:38,925 --> 01:24:40,405
Brace yourself for the crash.

1318
01:24:52,885 --> 01:24:54,164
How long before we have power?

1319
01:24:54,245 --> 01:24:56,165
Seven or eight minutes, sir.

1320
01:24:56,244 --> 01:24:58,325
In eight minutes
we'll be blown out of the water!

1321
01:24:58,404 --> 01:25:00,364
Speed the engines full power.

1322
01:25:00,444 --> 01:25:02,844
Prepare for hard forward turn.

1323
01:25:08,124 --> 01:25:11,084
Alex,
if you can hear me, use the ship's intercom.

1324
01:25:13,803 --> 01:25:15,444
Left, Alex, go to the left.

1325
01:25:15,524 --> 01:25:16,923
Alex, can you hear me?

1326
01:25:17,003 --> 01:25:18,603
If you can hear me, use the ship's intercom.

1327
01:25:18,683 --> 01:25:20,723
I can hear you.

1328
01:25:20,803 --> 01:25:21,724
We're running out of time.

1329
01:25:21,803 --> 01:25:22,643
All right, look.

1330
01:25:22,723 --> 01:25:24,522
Which way to the bow thrusters?

1331
01:25:24,603 --> 01:25:26,322
You flooded it. There's no way to get there.

1332
01:25:26,403 --> 01:25:27,803
I can get there.

1333
01:25:27,883 --> 01:25:29,123
Just talk me through it.

1334
01:25:29,203 --> 01:25:33,322
OK. The bow thrusters are two large
wheels connected by a small shaft.

1335
01:25:33,402 --> 01:25:37,563
You can find them at the end of the shaft
below the bilge pump room.

1336
01:25:37,643 --> 01:25:38,603
The bilge pump room.

1337
01:25:38,681 --> 01:25:39,562
Do you copy?

1338
01:25:39,641 --> 01:25:41,322
Yeah, copy that.

1339
01:25:41,402 --> 01:25:42,762
Look, stay with us.

1340
01:25:42,842 --> 01:25:46,441
You talk us through it,
I'll follow your voice.

1341
01:25:46,521 --> 01:25:50,401
OK, you're in section BT-1.

1342
01:25:50,482 --> 01:25:52,802
At the end of the hallway is a hatch.

1343
01:25:52,882 --> 01:25:55,121
That'll bring you into the bilge pump room.

1344
01:25:55,201 --> 01:25:56,401
Hatch. Hatch.

1345
01:25:56,481 --> 01:25:59,761
It's at the same level as where you are,
so there must be some air.

1346
01:25:59,841 --> 01:26:00,802
Have you got it?

1347
01:26:03,080 --> 01:26:04,321
You're going to have to lose the vest.

1348
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:06,121
What do you mean, lose my vest?

1349
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:07,680
We're going under.

1350
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:11,480
Damn, man.

1351
01:26:28,999 --> 01:26:30,839
Let's get the hell out of here!

1352
01:26:30,919 --> 01:26:32,838
Move away from the railing!

1353
01:26:32,919 --> 01:26:34,599
Harvey, wait for me!

1354
01:26:34,679 --> 01:26:36,199
Come on, over against the wall!

1355
01:26:36,278 --> 01:26:38,359
What's going on?

1356
01:26:38,439 --> 01:26:41,199
At the far side is a short slide.

1357
01:26:41,278 --> 01:26:44,118
That will lead into the bow thruster room.

1358
01:26:44,199 --> 01:26:45,798
Alex, can you hear me?

1359
01:26:45,879 --> 01:26:47,879
We're getting very close.

1360
01:27:01,238 --> 01:27:03,916
The bow thrusters,
they're two large wheels...

1361
01:27:03,997 --> 01:27:06,117
..connected to a shaft...

1362
01:27:06,197 --> 01:27:07,478
..that will turn the propeller.

1363
01:27:19,796 --> 01:27:21,357
Now, when you find the wheel,...

1364
01:27:21,436 --> 01:27:23,596
..turn it as fast you can.

1365
01:27:23,677 --> 01:27:25,197
Hold on, hold on.

1366
01:27:25,276 --> 01:27:27,195
You only turn one wheel at a time.

1367
01:27:27,275 --> 01:27:30,396
If you turn them both,
you'll cancel yourself out.

1368
01:27:30,476 --> 01:27:32,915
Make sure
you turn the starboard wheel only.

1369
01:27:32,996 --> 01:27:34,955
OK, look.

1370
01:27:35,035 --> 01:27:36,595
We have to play tag.

1371
01:27:36,675 --> 01:27:37,915
I'll go down first.

1372
01:27:37,996 --> 01:27:39,315
You follow me in 15 seconds.

1373
01:27:39,395 --> 01:27:40,795
All right.

1374
01:28:10,993 --> 01:28:14,513
They're turning us. Sir, they're turning us.

1375
01:28:14,593 --> 01:28:15,513
Yes.

1376
01:28:15,593 --> 01:28:16,993
Yes, it's working.

1377
01:28:55,191 --> 01:28:57,071
No, no, no, no.

1378
01:28:58,910 --> 01:29:01,031
Make it stop.

1379
01:29:16,989 --> 01:29:18,229
Oh, my God! Everybody down!

1380
01:29:19,189 --> 01:29:20,989
We're going to crash!

1381
01:29:41,228 --> 01:29:43,388
Oh, God!

1382
01:29:47,588 --> 01:29:48,708
Aagh!

1383
01:30:07,627 --> 01:30:08,506
I think we did it!

1384
01:30:08,586 --> 01:30:10,066
We turned it!

1385
01:30:15,667 --> 01:30:16,986
Get down!

1386
01:30:17,065 --> 01:30:18,066
Aagh!

1387
01:30:30,226 --> 01:30:32,785
Whoa!

1388
01:30:32,865 --> 01:30:35,145
I do believe we have a miss!

1389
01:30:36,505 --> 01:30:38,626
Impossible! No!

1390
01:30:38,705 --> 01:30:39,664
No!

1391
01:30:45,465 --> 01:30:46,904
They did it.

1392
01:30:46,984 --> 01:30:48,104
Oh!

1393
01:30:51,904 --> 01:30:52,984
Oh, we made it.

1394
01:30:53,065 --> 01:30:54,824
Oh, Jack.

1395
01:31:01,624 --> 01:31:03,343
Yes. Yes.

1396
01:31:04,464 --> 01:31:05,503
I sure hope somebody got that on tape.

1397
01:31:05,584 --> 01:31:06,504
Yeah.

1398
01:31:07,584 --> 01:31:08,464
Oh!

1399
01:31:24,263 --> 01:31:25,302
Oh, shit.

1400
01:31:26,302 --> 01:31:27,462
Oh, shit!

1401
01:31:29,982 --> 01:31:31,382
Oh, shit.

1402
01:31:33,701 --> 01:31:35,181
Aw, shit.

1403
01:31:35,262 --> 01:31:36,421
Mum.

1404
01:31:48,421 --> 01:31:49,421
Hey!

1405
01:31:50,461 --> 01:31:52,181
Hey!

1406
01:32:02,861 --> 01:32:04,500
We got to get out of here.

1407
01:32:04,579 --> 01:32:05,900
Yeah, no kidding. Come on.

1408
01:32:05,980 --> 01:32:07,380
Come on!

1409
01:32:09,180 --> 01:32:11,700
Come on, hurry up!
They're coming right at us!

1410
01:32:11,779 --> 01:32:14,300
Come on! Faster than that!

1411
01:32:14,379 --> 01:32:15,780
We have right of way here!

1412
01:32:15,859 --> 01:32:18,380
Sorry! Excuse us!

1413
01:32:18,459 --> 01:32:19,698
No way!

1414
01:32:20,979 --> 01:32:22,619
That was close!

1415
01:32:25,259 --> 01:32:26,778
To the bridge!

1416
01:32:29,979 --> 01:32:30,899
Where's anchor control?

1417
01:32:30,978 --> 01:32:31,899
We got to stop her.

1418
01:32:31,979 --> 01:32:33,099
What? Anchor control?

1419
01:32:33,178 --> 01:32:35,378
We can't drop it. We're moving too fast.

1420
01:32:35,458 --> 01:32:36,298
Did you see Annie?

1421
01:32:36,378 --> 01:32:37,298
No.

1422
01:32:37,378 --> 01:32:38,538
I got it! I got it.

1423
01:32:38,618 --> 01:32:40,979
No. No anchor can stop a moving ship.

1424
01:32:42,657 --> 01:32:45,577
It's moving. It's going down.

1425
01:33:05,177 --> 01:33:06,697
I can feel it. We're slowing down.

1426
01:33:06,776 --> 01:33:08,656
No. Too fast. It's not going to hold.

1427
01:33:12,577 --> 01:33:13,496
Harvey!

1428
01:33:13,576 --> 01:33:14,936
Get in the corner! Brace yourselves!

1429
01:33:15,016 --> 01:33:16,856
Oh, my God! We're doomed!

1430
01:33:21,455 --> 01:33:24,095
We're not going to stop!
We're not going to stop!

1431
01:33:27,976 --> 01:33:28,815
Drop the other one.

1432
01:33:28,895 --> 01:33:32,255
I'm telling you. We're still too fast.

1433
01:33:36,174 --> 01:33:37,574
It's stuck.

1434
01:33:43,175 --> 01:33:45,334
- God, no. No.

1435
01:33:45,414 --> 01:33:47,094
Where's the horn? Where's the horn?

1436
01:33:47,174 --> 01:33:49,094
How can there not be a horn?

1437
01:33:49,175 --> 01:33:51,494
There's got to be a horn here somewhere.

1438
01:33:58,974 --> 01:34:00,013
Where's he going?

1439
01:34:01,373 --> 01:34:02,293
Oh, shit!

1440
01:34:09,613 --> 01:34:11,093
What you doing with the wheel?

1441
01:34:11,173 --> 01:34:12,373
Huh?

1442
01:34:12,453 --> 01:34:14,493
It doesn't work!

1443
01:34:14,572 --> 01:34:15,532
What?

1444
01:34:15,612 --> 01:34:18,612
Jan, hold this a sec.

1445
01:34:20,972 --> 01:34:21,973
Allez! Allez!

1446
01:34:22,052 --> 01:34:23,451
Oh, no. No, no, no.

1447
01:34:27,652 --> 01:34:28,612
Aagh!

1448
01:34:35,612 --> 01:34:37,092
I can't believe it.

1449
01:34:37,171 --> 01:34:38,130
This is slowing us down.

1450
01:34:38,211 --> 01:34:40,411
Nine knots.

1451
01:34:40,491 --> 01:34:42,091
Jeez!

1452
01:34:42,171 --> 01:34:43,691
Oh, man! Let's go!

1453
01:34:43,771 --> 01:34:44,771
Huh?

1454
01:34:46,091 --> 01:34:47,851
This isn't happening.

1455
01:34:51,011 --> 01:34:52,891
Oh, no. No more. Not again.

1456
01:34:52,971 --> 01:34:55,770
I found it! I found it! I found it!

1457
01:34:57,290 --> 01:34:59,890
Everybody get out of the way!
There's a big boat coming!

1458
01:34:59,971 --> 01:35:00,889
Please!

1459
01:35:00,969 --> 01:35:01,809
Now!

1460
01:35:01,890 --> 01:35:03,090
Run! Jump!

1461
01:35:03,169 --> 01:35:04,009
Swim!

1462
01:35:04,090 --> 01:35:05,130
Come on, people, move out of the way!

1463
01:35:05,210 --> 01:35:07,290
We don't have brakes!

1464
01:35:07,370 --> 01:35:08,569
This is not a dream!

1465
01:35:08,649 --> 01:35:09,649
Jump!

1466
01:35:11,369 --> 01:35:13,010
Abandon your ship!

1467
01:35:21,449 --> 01:35:23,569
Oh, my God! We're mowing them down!

1468
01:35:27,008 --> 01:35:28,328
Stop!

1469
01:35:28,409 --> 01:35:29,529
it... it's helping.

1470
01:35:29,608 --> 01:35:31,368
Seven knots.

1471
01:35:47,447 --> 01:35:48,607
Turn right! Turn right!

1472
01:35:52,007 --> 01:35:53,607
Look out!

1473
01:35:58,566 --> 01:36:00,887
Whoa!

1474
01:36:00,967 --> 01:36:02,247
Shit!

1475
01:36:08,646 --> 01:36:10,565
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.

1476
01:36:18,565 --> 01:36:22,285
Two bedrooms, dining room, kitchen, nook.

1477
01:36:22,365 --> 01:36:24,086
Mummy, there's a big boat.

1478
01:36:24,165 --> 01:36:26,685
I know.
There are a lot of big boats here, honey.

1479
01:36:26,764 --> 01:36:27,965
What a cute boy...

1480
01:36:28,045 --> 01:36:30,365
..and smart of you to notice all the ships.

1481
01:36:30,445 --> 01:36:33,444
The walls are a soft European eggshell...

1482
01:36:35,365 --> 01:36:37,045
God, it'll take forever to stop us.

1483
01:36:39,844 --> 01:36:41,284
Harvey?

1484
01:36:45,764 --> 01:36:47,004
Quick!

1485
01:36:50,283 --> 01:36:51,683
We're not going to fit! It's too tight!

1486
01:37:00,763 --> 01:37:01,723
Get down!

1487
01:37:01,803 --> 01:37:03,004
Aagh!

1488
01:37:21,761 --> 01:37:23,682
Six knots!

1489
01:37:34,241 --> 01:37:37,361
Aagh!

1490
01:37:41,641 --> 01:37:42,481
Aagh!

1491
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:44,360
Oooh!

1492
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:48,960
What? What? I can't hear you.

1493
01:37:52,360 --> 01:37:53,480
Aagh!

1494
01:37:57,360 --> 01:37:59,439
It's coming.

1495
01:38:07,959 --> 01:38:09,679
Five knots!

1496
01:38:22,558 --> 01:38:23,798
Ooh!

1497
01:38:41,237 --> 01:38:42,518
Four...

1498
01:38:42,597 --> 01:38:43,837
..aagh!

1499
01:38:44,957 --> 01:38:45,876
Stop!

1500
01:38:53,636 --> 01:38:55,636
Here it comes now!

1501
01:38:58,396 --> 01:38:59,277
It's really big, Mum.

1502
01:38:59,356 --> 01:39:00,876
Oh, my God!

1503
01:39:02,236 --> 01:39:03,476
Oh, my God!

1504
01:39:07,635 --> 01:39:08,676
Get down!

1505
01:39:10,355 --> 01:39:12,155
Aagh!

1506
01:39:33,634 --> 01:39:35,554
Aagh!

1507
01:39:37,954 --> 01:39:39,513
Two knots!

1508
01:39:39,594 --> 01:39:41,034
Almost stopped!

1509
01:39:58,073 --> 01:39:59,233
Oh, no!

1510
01:40:04,193 --> 01:40:05,833
Get down!

1511
01:40:16,592 --> 01:40:17,552
Zero.

1512
01:40:52,349 --> 01:40:53,830
Aagh! Aagh! Ooh.

1513
01:40:59,629 --> 01:41:01,670
My car!

1514
01:41:07,389 --> 01:41:09,349
I got to find Annie.

1515
01:41:20,788 --> 01:41:22,548
Shit! She's going over!

1516
01:41:24,748 --> 01:41:26,268
We're tipping!

1517
01:41:26,347 --> 01:41:27,267
We're tipping!

1518
01:41:41,027 --> 01:41:42,546
Ow.

1519
01:41:47,227 --> 01:41:48,786
We're docked.

1520
01:41:49,946 --> 01:41:51,587
We're docked!

1521
01:41:51,666 --> 01:41:52,986
I can't believe it!

1522
01:41:53,067 --> 01:41:54,546
We're safe.

1523
01:42:07,345 --> 01:42:08,346
Zero.

1524
01:42:17,505 --> 01:42:18,825
Say what?

1525
01:42:18,905 --> 01:42:20,985
Bad luck to run ship over town.

1526
01:42:21,064 --> 01:42:22,664
No shit, bad luck, man.

1527
01:42:22,745 --> 01:42:25,265
I just bought a condo here.

1528
01:42:25,345 --> 01:42:27,464
My God.

1529
01:42:27,544 --> 01:42:29,384
You all right?

1530
01:42:29,464 --> 01:42:32,384
Yeah. I think I broke my other arm.

1531
01:42:32,464 --> 01:42:34,865
The ship's parked in the middle of town,...

1532
01:42:34,944 --> 01:42:37,103
..but, hey, it could've been worse.

1533
01:42:37,184 --> 01:42:39,944
I'm not sure how,
but it could've been worse.

1534
01:42:40,024 --> 01:42:41,664
I got to get my girl.

1535
01:42:41,744 --> 01:42:42,664
Thank you.

1536
01:42:44,384 --> 01:42:45,463
Uh!

1537
01:42:45,543 --> 01:42:46,584
Sorry.

1538
01:42:47,544 --> 01:42:48,983
Be careful.

1539
01:42:49,943 --> 01:42:51,663
I'll go check on the others.

1540
01:43:03,983 --> 01:43:06,462
Looks like your vacation is almost over.

1541
01:43:06,541 --> 01:43:08,861
Just stay away from me,
or you're going to get hurt,...

1542
01:43:08,942 --> 01:43:09,942
..l swear to God.

1543
01:43:10,022 --> 01:43:11,542
What are you going to do, Annie?

1544
01:43:11,622 --> 01:43:13,701
Splash water on me?

1545
01:43:23,141 --> 01:43:24,061
I'm driving now.

1546
01:43:24,141 --> 01:43:26,141
Hey, Annie! Hey!

1547
01:43:27,262 --> 01:43:28,860
Annie!

1548
01:43:28,940 --> 01:43:30,981
Come back! You stay with me!

1549
01:43:31,060 --> 01:43:32,660
You're my hostage!

1550
01:43:32,741 --> 01:43:34,541
I need a boat!

1551
01:43:37,459 --> 01:43:38,860
Can I help you?

1552
01:43:38,940 --> 01:43:41,301
I'm a cop. I need to borrow your boat.

1553
01:43:41,380 --> 01:43:43,501
What? You've got to be kidding me.

1554
01:43:43,580 --> 01:43:46,340
This is joke, right?
You're messing with my head.

1555
01:43:46,419 --> 01:43:48,220
Come on, man, you gotta be kidding me!

1556
01:43:49,340 --> 01:43:50,460
Can't you see I'm on a date?

1557
01:43:50,540 --> 01:43:53,940
Alex Shaw, LAPD. Start the boat.

1558
01:43:54,019 --> 01:43:55,299
LAPD? I'm in the Caribbean, man.

1559
01:43:55,379 --> 01:43:56,379
What are you doing here?

1560
01:43:57,419 --> 01:43:58,939
Stop him, Maurice.

1561
01:43:59,020 --> 01:44:01,299
Know how many hours of therapy
I've had because of you guys?

1562
01:44:01,378 --> 01:44:02,259
And that shit's expensive!

1563
01:44:02,338 --> 01:44:03,178
You drive.

1564
01:44:03,259 --> 01:44:04,659
Hey, hey, where are you going?

1565
01:44:04,739 --> 01:44:06,819
No!

1566
01:44:18,977 --> 01:44:20,538
Hey! Annie!

1567
01:44:30,617 --> 01:44:32,537
OK, OK, take it easy, man!

1568
01:44:32,617 --> 01:44:35,537
This boat cost me $150,000.

1569
01:44:39,256 --> 01:44:41,256
That way.

1570
01:44:41,337 --> 01:44:43,537
OK. That's it!

1571
01:44:43,616 --> 01:44:46,496
I want a promissory note right now!

1572
01:44:46,576 --> 01:44:48,136
Whoa!

1573
01:45:03,255 --> 01:45:04,135
Give it!

1574
01:45:04,215 --> 01:45:06,256
Let go of me!

1575
01:45:06,335 --> 01:45:07,176
Ow!

1576
01:45:07,255 --> 01:45:09,054
Do we have a fiery temper?

1577
01:45:09,135 --> 01:45:10,534
You have no idea!

1578
01:45:10,615 --> 01:45:12,535
There she is.

1579
01:45:12,615 --> 01:45:14,415
Look! Fireworks!

1580
01:45:16,615 --> 01:45:17,535
It's her.

1581
01:45:17,614 --> 01:45:18,495
What?

1582
01:45:18,574 --> 01:45:19,455
That way, fast.

1583
01:45:19,534 --> 01:45:20,655
Nah, I can't drive that fast!

1584
01:45:20,734 --> 01:45:22,254
There's shallow reefs! Shit!

1585
01:45:42,253 --> 01:45:44,173
Get as close to that plane as you can.

1586
01:45:44,253 --> 01:45:46,374
Give me one good reason.

1587
01:45:46,453 --> 01:45:48,733
If you don't, I'll throw you over.

1588
01:45:48,812 --> 01:45:49,852
OK.

1589
01:45:49,933 --> 01:45:51,333
That's a good reason.

1590
01:46:01,373 --> 01:46:03,292
Almost at speed!

1591
01:46:03,371 --> 01:46:04,691
Don't! Don't you...

1592
01:46:04,772 --> 01:46:06,692
Ow! Let me go!

1593
01:46:06,771 --> 01:46:09,652
I think you better stay with me.

1594
01:46:09,732 --> 01:46:10,891
Get closer!

1595
01:46:10,971 --> 01:46:12,331
What?

1596
01:46:23,611 --> 01:46:24,731
Let me go!

1597
01:46:24,811 --> 01:46:26,531
You want to go? I'll let you go...

1598
01:46:26,610 --> 01:46:28,851
..at about 10,000 feet!

1599
01:46:28,930 --> 01:46:30,730
Get me closer!

1600
01:46:33,131 --> 01:46:34,129
Huh?

1601
01:46:34,210 --> 01:46:35,410
He's going to shoot the plane!

1602
01:46:38,250 --> 01:46:39,890
Nice shot.

1603
01:46:42,330 --> 01:46:45,890
Let's see if he can hold on now!

1604
01:46:45,969 --> 01:46:47,650
Follow me!

1605
01:46:56,848 --> 01:46:58,448
Let go!

1606
01:46:58,529 --> 01:46:59,848
He... he's supposed to let go.

1607
01:46:59,929 --> 01:47:01,129
Let go!

1608
01:47:02,929 --> 01:47:05,528
No, no, he's reeling himself in!

1609
01:47:05,608 --> 01:47:08,049
Follow him! Follow him!

1610
01:47:09,368 --> 01:47:12,049
Oh, you little shit.

1611
01:47:12,129 --> 01:47:14,127
Here we go!

1612
01:47:15,848 --> 01:47:17,248
No!

1613
01:47:17,328 --> 01:47:18,927
No, don't!

1614
01:47:19,008 --> 01:47:20,007
No!

1615
01:47:21,367 --> 01:47:23,327
Come here!

1616
01:47:23,407 --> 01:47:25,648
Oh, God.

1617
01:47:44,046 --> 01:47:46,166
Alex! Alex!

1618
01:47:46,246 --> 01:47:48,606
Annie!

1619
01:47:49,086 --> 01:47:50,606
Annie!

1620
01:48:02,565 --> 01:48:05,005
- Hi.
- Hi.

1621
01:48:05,086 --> 01:48:06,164
Hi.

1622
01:48:06,804 --> 01:48:09,085
Come on.

1623
01:48:16,204 --> 01:48:17,324
Now hold on!

1624
01:48:19,125 --> 01:48:20,404
Aagh!

1625
01:48:24,044 --> 01:48:25,684
What's he riding that banana peel for?

1626
01:48:25,763 --> 01:48:26,843
What's he doing?

1627
01:48:29,603 --> 01:48:31,843
Aagh!

1628
01:48:50,843 --> 01:48:51,803
Aagh!

1629
01:48:54,602 --> 01:48:57,322
Aagh!

1630
01:49:01,001 --> 01:49:02,282
Abandon ship.

1631
01:49:02,361 --> 01:49:03,961
All the crewmembers,...

1632
01:49:04,042 --> 01:49:05,921
..abandon ship immediately.

1633
01:49:06,002 --> 01:49:08,081
It's gonna blow, it's gonna blow!

1634
01:49:08,161 --> 01:49:09,921
Jump, fool! Get off that thing!

1635
01:49:10,921 --> 01:49:11,801
Jump!

1636
01:49:40,999 --> 01:49:43,279
Hope they can hold their breath
a long time.

1637
01:49:43,360 --> 01:49:45,840
Come on, don't run out of air.

1638
01:49:45,919 --> 01:49:48,359
Me not see 'em. Me think they dead.

1639
01:49:48,439 --> 01:49:49,919
They're not gone.

1640
01:50:09,997 --> 01:50:13,038
There they are! There they are!

1641
01:50:13,117 --> 01:50:14,038
Hey, over here!

1642
01:50:14,117 --> 01:50:15,317
Hey, this way!

1643
01:50:30,597 --> 01:50:32,916
Here, come on. I got you. Come on.

1644
01:50:32,996 --> 01:50:34,036
Come on, hurry up.

1645
01:50:34,116 --> 01:50:35,436
Hurry up, come on. It's gonna blow.

1646
01:50:35,517 --> 01:50:37,316
Hurry up, it's gonna blow.

1647
01:50:41,435 --> 01:50:42,916
Aagh!

1648
01:51:02,395 --> 01:51:04,434
Untie 'em, untie 'em.

1649
01:51:04,515 --> 01:51:05,834
You're all right.

1650
01:51:07,714 --> 01:51:09,715
- You OK?
- Yeah.

1651
01:51:09,795 --> 01:51:12,114
I was just so scared. I was so scared.

1652
01:51:12,194 --> 01:51:15,554
I didn't think
I was gonna make it there for a second.

1653
01:51:19,113 --> 01:51:20,314
Thank you.

1654
01:51:24,834 --> 01:51:29,553
Look what I found in international waters.

1655
01:51:29,633 --> 01:51:31,714
This really is paradise.

1656
01:51:31,793 --> 01:51:33,833
I got something for you.

1657
01:51:39,513 --> 01:51:41,313
Oh.

1658
01:51:42,912 --> 01:51:43,752
Wow.

1659
01:51:43,833 --> 01:51:46,752
You want to wear this for a while?

1660
01:51:49,511 --> 01:51:52,632
How long were you thinking?

1661
01:51:52,712 --> 01:51:54,152
50 years.

1662
01:51:54,232 --> 01:51:55,192
Yeah?

1663
01:51:56,512 --> 01:51:57,712
Yeah.

1664
01:52:06,991 --> 01:52:09,751
Can I make all the travel plans
from now on?

1665
01:52:09,831 --> 01:52:11,031
Deal.

1666
01:52:57,409 --> 01:52:57,669
Hello.

1667
01:52:58,749 --> 01:52:59,828
Mr Kenter.

1668
01:52:59,907 --> 01:53:00,868
Oh, Annie.

1669
01:53:01,948 --> 01:53:04,108
- Uh... Oh, you're back again.
- Yeah.

1670
01:53:04,188 --> 01:53:05,348
Hope you don't mind.

1671
01:53:05,428 --> 01:53:06,868
I kind of requested you.

1672
01:53:06,947 --> 01:53:10,067
I wanted to make up for last week.

1673
01:53:10,148 --> 01:53:11,348
Why would I mind?

1674
01:53:11,427 --> 01:53:14,347
Gosh, uh...
I'm sure it'll go much better today.

1675
01:53:14,427 --> 01:53:15,546
Oh, yeah, it will.

1676
01:53:15,627 --> 01:53:18,027
- Had some problems.
- Nervous, yeah, a little bit.

1677
01:53:18,107 --> 01:53:20,027
OK, Mr Kenter, here we go.

1678
01:53:33,146 --> 01:53:35,867
Sorry, but that bus was going way too fast.

1679
01:53:35,946 --> 01:53:38,665
I noticed that. Uh, make a left here.

1680
01:53:38,746 --> 01:53:39,866
Got it. Excuse me.

1681
01:53:39,946 --> 01:53:43,546
Thank you, thank you.
