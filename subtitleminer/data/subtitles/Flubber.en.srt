1
00:02:43,411 --> 00:02:45,285
Oh. Hmm.

2
00:02:45,413 --> 00:02:47,287
Oh. Oh.

3
00:02:47,415 --> 00:02:49,159
I`m up!

4
00:02:52,129 --> 00:02:56,043
- Ah.
- Phillip, it`s 7:00. Are you awake?

5
00:02:56,133 --> 00:02:59,383
Up and ready for a new day.

6
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:02,554
- Oh!
- Oh what a beautiful morning

7
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,597
Oh what a beautiful day

8
00:03:36,384 --> 00:03:39,800
- I can`t find my socks.
- They`re in your shoes.

9
00:03:39,929 --> 00:03:42,385
- Where are my shoes?
- They`re on your feet.

10
00:03:42,473 --> 00:03:44,383
Thank you.

11
00:03:50,982 --> 00:03:54,767
Thank you, Weber.

12
00:03:58,991 --> 00:04:00,865
Hi.

13
00:04:02,912 --> 00:04:05,829
- Have you seen the paper this morning?
- Oh, yes, I did.

14
00:04:05,957 --> 00:04:08,033
You know, if I could solve
this whole metastable compound business,

15
00:04:08,167 --> 00:04:10,160
I could save the college.

16
00:04:10,294 --> 00:04:12,501
A new energy source
would be worth a fortune.

17
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:15,916
You better hurry up. The loan`s due
at the end of the school year.

18
00:04:16,009 --> 00:04:19,544
Not to worry, Weebo.
I`m very close.

19
00:04:19,679 --> 00:04:21,719
May I see my schedule, please?

20
00:04:21,848 --> 00:04:24,968
Ahhhh. After school
there`s something.

21
00:04:25,102 --> 00:04:26,976
I know there is. What is it?

22
00:04:27,104 --> 00:04:29,393
- This is your complete schedule.
- Hmm. Let`s see.

23
00:04:29,523 --> 00:04:31,432
Unless you didn`t
tell me something.

24
00:04:31,525 --> 00:04:33,648
What is it? There`s something.
There`s something there.

25
00:04:33,778 --> 00:04:35,687
What is it? Oh.

26
00:04:35,821 --> 00:04:37,861
It`s something to do with white.

27
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:40,564
Oh, what is it? I know it`s
something important. I know it!

28
00:04:40,702 --> 00:04:43,489
Well, I don`t know. I`m sorry.
I know it`s so frustrating, isn`t it?

29
00:04:43,621 --> 00:04:46,077
I just hate that.
I wish I could help you.

30
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:49,292
- But I can`t.
- Haircut!

31
00:04:49,377 --> 00:04:52,747
Ha! Hmm!

32
00:04:54,883 --> 00:04:56,793
They can`t just
close down the school.

33
00:04:56,885 --> 00:04:59,673
Outside of the lvy League,
name me one private college...

34
00:04:59,805 --> 00:05:03,139
or university that isn`t
in financial trouble.

35
00:05:03,225 --> 00:05:05,977
Oh, all right. Name another.

36
00:05:06,062 --> 00:05:10,890
- You don`t think it`s too much?
- No. It`s elegant.

37
00:05:11,025 --> 00:05:14,691
And it`s a wonderful idea to go
with the big wedding this time.

38
00:05:14,779 --> 00:05:17,946
It does put the pressure
on the professor to show up.

39
00:05:18,074 --> 00:05:20,447
If he forgets this time,
that`s it.

40
00:05:20,577 --> 00:05:23,199
Well, in his case,
once is justifiable...

41
00:05:23,288 --> 00:05:27,369
and twice is understandable,
but three times--

42
00:05:28,877 --> 00:05:30,751
Coming through!

43
00:05:40,598 --> 00:05:42,970
Morning-- or afternoon,
whatever the case may be.

44
00:05:43,101 --> 00:05:46,719
We have a lot to talk about today,
so let`s get into it without delay.

45
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:50,313
Oh! Oh, uh, thank you,
whoever gave me the plate of fruit...

46
00:05:50,442 --> 00:05:52,565
and the dead pheasant,

47
00:05:52,694 --> 00:05:54,568
but it does not count
as extra credit.

48
00:05:54,696 --> 00:05:57,401
Last time we were talking about
Newton`s Law of Gravitation.

49
00:05:57,491 --> 00:06:01,987
To review: We see this "G"
is like the "C" in E=MC squared.

50
00:06:02,121 --> 00:06:05,241
It`s a constant, constant universe,
as much as anything
is constant in the universe.

51
00:06:05,374 --> 00:06:07,747
It`s saying that the force of
attraction between two bodies...

52
00:06:07,877 --> 00:06:10,629
is in direct proportion to
the product of their masses...

53
00:06:10,755 --> 00:06:12,997
and in inverse proportion to the square
of the distance between them.

54
00:06:13,133 --> 00:06:18,589
An example would be-- Let`s make, uh,
naked man, "M-1." Naked lady, "M-2."

55
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,922
Now, according to this formula,
their attractive forces...

56
00:06:21,058 --> 00:06:23,762
would want to close
the distance to zero.

57
00:06:23,894 --> 00:06:26,765
Why don`t they? Hmm?

58
00:06:26,897 --> 00:06:28,854
The Earth! Ah.

59
00:06:28,983 --> 00:06:32,933
So, in essence that is
gravity and this...

60
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:36,938
is "Dr Richards Life Drawing."

61
00:06:37,074 --> 00:06:39,447
It`s not my class, is it?

62
00:06:48,587 --> 00:06:50,994
Phillip! Over here!

63
00:06:51,131 --> 00:06:53,836
Sara! Ooh! Very sorry.

64
00:06:55,594 --> 00:06:58,168
And so, momentum.

65
00:06:58,305 --> 00:07:02,089
May I sit here? Thank you.

66
00:07:02,184 --> 00:07:05,304
Hello, Sara.
What a pleasant surprise.

67
00:07:05,396 --> 00:07:08,397
- Hello, Ruthie.
- Martha.

68
00:07:08,524 --> 00:07:10,517
- Martha what?
- Martha. Me Martha.

69
00:07:10,652 --> 00:07:13,190
You Martha. Me professor.

70
00:07:13,321 --> 00:07:16,156
- Yes, I know.
- I was just gonna, you know,

71
00:07:16,241 --> 00:07:19,028
grade my lunch, eat a few tests
and hope for the best.

72
00:07:19,161 --> 00:07:21,652
- How do you hold it in?
- Well, like everybody else, Ruthie.

73
00:07:21,788 --> 00:07:24,458
I just cross my legs real tight.

74
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:26,830
No. I was talking
about your excitement.

75
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,831
- Excitement?
- The wedding.

76
00:07:29,964 --> 00:07:33,167
Congratulations!

77
00:07:35,344 --> 00:07:37,586
The wedding! Sara and l.
Oh, the wedding.

78
00:07:37,722 --> 00:07:39,845
Oh, l`m looking forward to it.
Aren`t you, honey?

79
00:07:39,933 --> 00:07:42,720
- It`s today.
- Are you sure?

80
00:07:44,229 --> 00:07:46,898
- The wedding is today. Okay?
- I believe you.

81
00:07:47,023 --> 00:07:51,068
6:30 at the Presbyterian Church
on Beach Street.

82
00:07:51,194 --> 00:07:54,694
- I`ve been there.
- We had our rehearsal there last night.

83
00:07:54,823 --> 00:07:58,738
That`s right, we did!
It went well?

84
00:07:58,869 --> 00:08:00,743
- Yes, it did, but it doesn`t count.
- Good.

85
00:08:00,871 --> 00:08:03,493
- No?
- The wedding counts,
and I want you to promise me...

86
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,702
on everything between us
that you`ll be there, okay?

87
00:08:06,794 --> 00:08:08,704
I`d rather die
than disappoint you.

88
00:08:08,838 --> 00:08:13,547
Well, this is going to be
the very last time I try to marry you.

89
00:08:13,676 --> 00:08:16,002
I imagine so.

90
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:18,005
I know that I love you,

91
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:21,052
but l`m not sure
that you can love me.

92
00:08:22,436 --> 00:08:24,393
That`s ridiculous.

93
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,389
I love you with all my heart.

94
00:08:26,482 --> 00:08:29,352
With every cell, with every
molecule, with every atom.

95
00:08:29,443 --> 00:08:31,732
I love you on a subatomic level.

96
00:08:31,821 --> 00:08:34,738
Hmm! Prove it to me
tonight at 6:30.

97
00:08:34,866 --> 00:08:36,739
Prove what, honey?

98
00:08:39,287 --> 00:08:41,445
- That you love me.
- I love you.

99
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:46,245
- 6:30.
- Good luck.

100
00:08:47,462 --> 00:08:49,336
Thank you, Betty.

101
00:08:49,464 --> 00:08:52,252
I knew I shouldn`t
have come, but--

102
00:08:52,384 --> 00:08:54,875
Oh, l`m very crazy about him,
you see, Miss French.

103
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:57,093
And this is the God`s truth:

104
00:08:57,181 --> 00:08:59,933
I want him to have
what he wants,

105
00:09:00,059 --> 00:09:02,135
even if it means
you instead of me.

106
00:09:02,269 --> 00:09:05,804
No, no! You love him.
Don`t give him up.

107
00:09:10,153 --> 00:09:12,442
Hey! l`m watching something!

108
00:09:13,823 --> 00:09:16,611
- Weber!
- Why don`t you be quiet?

109
00:09:16,701 --> 00:09:19,275
I`m watching TV.

110
00:09:19,413 --> 00:09:22,118
Download some manners! Ohh!

111
00:09:22,249 --> 00:09:24,705
Oh, but he ain`t in love
with me, Miss French.

112
00:09:24,835 --> 00:09:27,291
Mmm. Tell me about it.

113
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,234
Hello, Phil.

114
00:09:50,362 --> 00:09:52,983
What are you working on?

115
00:09:53,073 --> 00:09:56,158
Can`t remember?

116
00:09:56,285 --> 00:09:58,491
I understand.

117
00:09:58,621 --> 00:10:00,827
It`s a damn shame they`re
shutting your college down.

118
00:10:00,956 --> 00:10:03,827
I read about it in the paper.

119
00:10:03,918 --> 00:10:06,076
- It`s not over yet.
- Oh, we`re doing fine at Rutland.

120
00:10:06,212 --> 00:10:08,917
No such financial problems. Hey!

121
00:10:09,048 --> 00:10:11,171
Are you still working on
that lighter-than-air compound?

122
00:10:11,259 --> 00:10:13,382
It`s a, uh,
propulsive polymer and--

123
00:10:13,511 --> 00:10:15,884
I don`t mean to be rude,
Wilson, but l-- I have to go.

124
00:10:16,014 --> 00:10:18,007
You don`t seem too happy
to see me, Phil.

125
00:10:18,141 --> 00:10:20,467
- I`m not.
- Well--

126
00:10:20,561 --> 00:10:24,724
All the years we`ve known
each other, studying, working together.

127
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:30,361
- What happened between us, Phil?
- Well, I just got tired of you
stealing my ideas, Wilson.

128
00:10:30,446 --> 00:10:33,566
And what would you have done with them?
You would have misplaced them,

129
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:36,570
forgotten them, lost them.

130
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:38,612
There`s no doubt you`re
the brighter of the two of us.

131
00:10:38,746 --> 00:10:41,534
You have a genius for science.
I grant you that.

132
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,955
It`s just the science
of daily life that eludes you.

133
00:10:44,085 --> 00:10:48,582
I`ve heard that copper psych
before. Excuse me. That`s very volatile.

134
00:10:48,715 --> 00:10:50,838
I won`t deny that I hate you
for your brilliance.

135
00:10:50,926 --> 00:10:53,382
I`m petty, corrupt.

136
00:10:53,512 --> 00:10:56,881
I probably would have gone mad trying
to compete with you in pure thought.

137
00:10:56,974 --> 00:11:00,058
But, uh, l`m not
an innovator like you, Phil.

138
00:11:00,144 --> 00:11:02,220
I`m an adapter, and to that end,

139
00:11:02,313 --> 00:11:04,804
I have profited from your ideas.

140
00:11:04,941 --> 00:11:07,432
- Why are you here?
- Well, to be honest,

141
00:11:07,569 --> 00:11:09,645
I`m here this weekend
to steal your fiancee...

142
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:11,772
and make her my wife.

143
00:11:11,906 --> 00:11:15,572
Well, I think you`ll be
sadly disappointed.

144
00:11:15,702 --> 00:11:17,991
I`ll see you
at the wedding then.

145
00:11:21,542 --> 00:11:23,618
Eh, it`s a little crooked.

146
00:11:23,752 --> 00:11:25,626
- Yeah. There you go.
- Weebo?

147
00:11:25,754 --> 00:11:27,747
- Mm-hmm?
- The wedding was not on my schedule.

148
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,413
- Mm, no?
- Why was that information deleted?

149
00:11:30,509 --> 00:11:33,926
Hmm. I don`t really know.

150
00:11:34,055 --> 00:11:36,213
- Do you have another virus?
- You know, now that you mention it,

151
00:11:36,307 --> 00:11:38,216
- I am feeling a little feverish.
- Really?

152
00:11:38,309 --> 00:11:40,219
Mm-hmm.

153
00:11:40,311 --> 00:11:42,269
You are a little hot. Say "ah."

154
00:11:42,355 --> 00:11:47,812
- Ah.
- Ah.

155
00:11:47,944 --> 00:11:50,862
Ah!

156
00:11:50,989 --> 00:11:53,445
Oh, yes!

157
00:11:54,827 --> 00:11:57,365
Hot. Cold. Hot. That`s it.

158
00:11:57,496 --> 00:11:59,454
The hydrocarbons have been
inhibiting the cooper pairs.

159
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,663
But if you go from hot
to cold very quickly,

160
00:12:01,792 --> 00:12:06,087
you get a conductive polymer
and you complete the metastable sphere.

161
00:12:06,172 --> 00:12:08,710
Behold! There it is.

162
00:12:08,842 --> 00:12:11,297
Now it`ll work. Yes!

163
00:12:11,386 --> 00:12:14,304
But, uh, w-what about
your wedding?

164
00:12:15,599 --> 00:12:18,054
Sorry, Sara.

165
00:12:23,065 --> 00:12:25,983
Should I call the church
and tell them you`ll be late?

166
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:35,488
Very good. Right.

167
00:12:41,543 --> 00:12:44,164
Very good. Ah.

168
00:12:44,254 --> 00:12:48,916
Flowing from the condenser
to the pressure reactor.

169
00:12:49,051 --> 00:12:50,925
Yes.

170
00:12:55,224 --> 00:12:57,430
Yes! Oh! lt`s ready.

171
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:04,888
Organic catalyst.

172
00:13:05,026 --> 00:13:06,900
The positive...

173
00:13:07,028 --> 00:13:10,896
and the negative.

174
00:13:11,032 --> 00:13:13,274
Little touch of electricity.

175
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:19,203
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

176
00:13:28,426 --> 00:13:31,047
Oh!

177
00:13:31,179 --> 00:13:33,848
Wow. What a bang.

178
00:13:33,931 --> 00:13:37,098
Yeah. Little touch
of electricity.

179
00:13:38,353 --> 00:13:40,595
That`s not helpful.

180
00:13:41,773 --> 00:13:43,647
Oh.

181
00:13:44,776 --> 00:13:47,730
Mmm. Mmm.

182
00:13:47,863 --> 00:13:52,988
- Oh, boy. This is not good.
- No, sir.
- Weebo?

183
00:13:53,118 --> 00:13:55,954
- What?
- Get a broom.
- That`ll help.

184
00:14:45,215 --> 00:14:47,124
Two years.

185
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,183
Wow.

186
00:16:28,324 --> 00:16:30,613
Oh.

187
00:16:30,743 --> 00:16:34,278
Oh, bless you. You have a cold.

188
00:16:34,414 --> 00:16:36,572
You should.
It`s 77 degrees Kelvin.

189
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:39,204
That`s very cold.

190
00:16:39,294 --> 00:16:41,915
Look. Come on.

191
00:16:42,047 --> 00:16:44,799
All right, uh,
let`s try and describe you.

192
00:16:44,925 --> 00:16:49,089
Uh, you`re an elastomer.
Yes, uh, um--

193
00:16:49,221 --> 00:16:51,095
Ooh! You`re highly viscous.

194
00:16:51,223 --> 00:16:53,097
But yet you can
phase-shift. Hoo!

195
00:16:53,225 --> 00:16:55,183
Well, uh, let`s see.

196
00:16:55,311 --> 00:16:57,767
You`re mouldable. Oh.

197
00:17:04,445 --> 00:17:06,319
It`s a little ticklish.

198
00:17:08,408 --> 00:17:10,864
Oh!

199
00:17:10,994 --> 00:17:14,659
You`re foldable.
You`re gullible.

200
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:17,459
Oh. All right. Let`s see.

201
00:17:17,543 --> 00:17:22,288
Oh, wait a minute. Okay. And--

202
00:17:22,423 --> 00:17:25,377
Ooh. You`re ductile.

203
00:17:29,639 --> 00:17:32,556
Oh! Oh. You`re elastic.

204
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:35,056
Let`s just see
how elastic you are. Okay.

205
00:17:48,742 --> 00:17:51,115
I`m the hackeysack king.

206
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:53,529
Hoo!

207
00:17:53,664 --> 00:17:56,535
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

208
00:17:56,667 --> 00:17:59,241
Hey, hey!
Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey!

209
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:05,422
Bravo! Encore!

210
00:18:05,552 --> 00:18:08,755
- Oh, boy. Uh, Weebo?
- Yes, sir?

211
00:18:08,889 --> 00:18:11,558
- Take a picture.
- Okay. Look this way. Smile!

212
00:18:20,526 --> 00:18:22,519
Yeow!

213
00:18:25,781 --> 00:18:27,691
Ow!

214
00:18:37,377 --> 00:18:39,535
- Weebo! lt`s amazing!
- Professor? Excuse me.

215
00:18:39,629 --> 00:18:42,796
- It`s miraculous! lt`s--
- Professor, it`s gone!

216
00:18:42,924 --> 00:18:46,376
It is! Oh! Oh!

217
00:18:48,931 --> 00:18:52,051
Professor, I think you gave it
a little too much free will.

218
00:18:53,436 --> 00:18:55,642
Oh, no.

219
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:05,061
There`s not a darn thing
to be afraid of, pal.

220
00:19:05,198 --> 00:19:07,570
How can anything
get in your window?

221
00:19:07,701 --> 00:19:09,574
It`s closed, okay?

222
00:19:09,703 --> 00:19:11,826
Whoa!

223
00:19:23,676 --> 00:19:25,254
Hey! Huh?

224
00:19:38,149 --> 00:19:40,438
Oh! Huh!

225
00:19:43,906 --> 00:19:47,109
- Whoa-oh!
- Yeah!

226
00:20:17,858 --> 00:20:19,566
Ha!

227
00:20:25,616 --> 00:20:28,653
Mmm! Whoa, Weebo! I got it!

228
00:20:28,786 --> 00:20:31,324
Great. Now what are you
gonna do with it?

229
00:20:31,456 --> 00:20:33,662
Oh! It has incredible inertia.

230
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,917
Mm, maybe it`s
just glad to see you.

231
00:20:37,045 --> 00:20:39,121
- Weebo?
- Yes?

232
00:20:39,214 --> 00:20:41,705
- Do you know what this is?
- Flying rubber?

233
00:20:41,842 --> 00:20:44,843
Yes. That`s what it is.

234
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:47,675
It`s flying rubber.

235
00:20:47,806 --> 00:20:50,179
It`s flubber!

236
00:20:52,228 --> 00:20:54,517
Ouch.

237
00:21:00,528 --> 00:21:03,019
- Thank you for waiting so long.
- Yes, ma`am.

238
00:21:10,539 --> 00:21:12,413
I`m sorry, Sara.

239
00:21:14,084 --> 00:21:16,207
Are you going to tell me,
"l told you so"?

240
00:21:16,295 --> 00:21:18,371
No, no.

241
00:21:18,505 --> 00:21:21,376
- I`m going to give you a ride home.
- Thank you.

242
00:21:25,763 --> 00:21:27,803
There you are.

243
00:21:27,932 --> 00:21:30,423
Careful. Watch your gown.

244
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,849
I`ve got it. Thank you.

245
00:21:39,569 --> 00:21:43,069
It`s perfectly safe, Weebo. It`s just
an ordinary radioactive isotope...

246
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:48,699
that Weber is now removing
from the lead containment unit.

247
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:52,286
Very good, Weber.

248
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:54,658
Then you place
the radioactive isotope...

249
00:21:54,794 --> 00:21:57,332
carefully behind
the sliding shutter.

250
00:21:59,299 --> 00:22:01,790
You see, the sliding shutter
works just like a camera.

251
00:22:01,926 --> 00:22:03,753
It regulates the flow
of gamma radiation.

252
00:22:03,845 --> 00:22:08,092
Instead of billions of random particles,
you have a precise stream of energy.

253
00:22:08,225 --> 00:22:13,812
Now we carefully place
the sliding shutter mechanism...

254
00:22:13,939 --> 00:22:16,477
underneath the flubber.

255
00:22:16,608 --> 00:22:19,100
And l`m burning up in here!
Weebo!

256
00:22:19,236 --> 00:22:21,110
Over here.

257
00:22:21,238 --> 00:22:24,275
The gamma radiation triggers a
metastable decay in the flubber itself.

258
00:22:24,367 --> 00:22:26,276
- Right.
- Which releases enormous
quantities of energy,

259
00:22:26,369 --> 00:22:28,278
- and that`s what propels the flubber.
- Of course.

260
00:22:28,371 --> 00:22:30,529
Now doing it this way,
I believe, is a lot more scientific...

261
00:22:30,665 --> 00:22:32,539
than dropping it
or kicking it...

262
00:22:32,667 --> 00:22:34,707
or bombarding it
with light bulb photon flashes.

263
00:22:34,836 --> 00:22:38,454
- Absolutely.
- I believe...

264
00:22:38,548 --> 00:22:41,300
by controlling
the gamma radiation flux,

265
00:22:41,385 --> 00:22:46,213
we can control the movement
of the flubber itself.

266
00:22:46,348 --> 00:22:48,970
- Cross your fingers, Weebo.
- Here`s hoping!
- Good luck.

267
00:22:54,023 --> 00:22:57,309
Oh, yes!

268
00:22:57,443 --> 00:22:59,732
It works!

269
00:23:03,742 --> 00:23:05,699
Descent, gradually.

270
00:23:08,663 --> 00:23:11,665
Back up again. Yeah!

271
00:23:16,338 --> 00:23:19,174
My wedding. Oh!

272
00:23:19,258 --> 00:23:21,334
- I`ve gotta go, Weebo.
- But you haven`t finished
the experiment yet.

273
00:23:21,469 --> 00:23:24,304
You`re just getting started.
You can`t just stop in the middle.

274
00:23:24,388 --> 00:23:27,010
The wedding. Oh, I can`t
miss this one, Weebo.

275
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:29,176
I`m aware of the time.
Thank you.

276
00:23:29,269 --> 00:23:31,938
But your days are wrong.
I`m getting married Friday, 6:30 p.m.

277
00:23:32,063 --> 00:23:35,682
- No. No, you`re not.
- Why not?

278
00:23:35,775 --> 00:23:38,777
Because you`re not
getting married, Phillip.

279
00:23:38,904 --> 00:23:41,858
- Yes, I am.
- You missed the wedding.

280
00:23:41,949 --> 00:23:45,365
It`s 6:30 in the morning.

281
00:23:45,494 --> 00:23:47,866
No. No.

282
00:23:47,997 --> 00:23:50,404
Yes. I`m sorry.

283
00:23:56,214 --> 00:23:58,705
- It is?
- Yeah.

284
00:24:01,177 --> 00:24:03,585
Sara.

285
00:24:31,126 --> 00:24:33,035
Sara?

286
00:24:36,715 --> 00:24:39,467
You have a lot of nerve
to show your face around here...

287
00:24:39,593 --> 00:24:42,428
after what you did to me
last night.

288
00:24:42,513 --> 00:24:45,264
Will you please let me explain?

289
00:24:45,391 --> 00:24:50,598
No. There`s nothing to explain.
You weren`t there.

290
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:53,440
For the third time you left me
standing at the altar.

291
00:24:55,568 --> 00:24:58,273
I`m sorry with all my heart.

292
00:24:58,363 --> 00:25:00,521
But please listen to me, Sara.
Please. You know me.

293
00:25:00,657 --> 00:25:03,444
You know how sometimes I can get
really fixated on an idea?

294
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:05,444
- I don`t want to hear it.
- Sara, you`ve got to hear it.

295
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:10,780
Sara, this is the reason
I didn`t make it last night.

296
00:25:12,503 --> 00:25:15,172
It`s flubber.

297
00:25:15,297 --> 00:25:17,835
Flubber! lt`s a metastable
compound, Sara.

298
00:25:17,967 --> 00:25:20,505
In layman`s terms, if you apply
a small amount of energy,

299
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:24,304
it liberates an enormous
quantity of energy.

300
00:25:24,432 --> 00:25:26,306
But the total effect
is transient, Sara.

301
00:25:26,434 --> 00:25:30,432
The moment you stop applying energy,
it returns to a quasi-plasmoid state.

302
00:25:30,522 --> 00:25:34,306
- Isn`t it remarkable, Sara?
- What`s remarkable, Phillip,

303
00:25:34,442 --> 00:25:36,316
is that I ever fell
in love with you.

304
00:25:36,445 --> 00:25:39,648
You broke my heart...

305
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,649
so that you could stay home
and make some green goo.

306
00:25:41,742 --> 00:25:43,984
Sara, it`s much more than that.

307
00:25:44,078 --> 00:25:47,162
Flubber could save this college.
Let me demonstrate.

308
00:25:47,248 --> 00:25:50,533
- No, no, no.
- Just give me one minute, okay?

309
00:25:52,879 --> 00:25:55,286
The flubber is placed
in my back pocket.

310
00:25:55,381 --> 00:25:58,169
When I exit this window,
I will fall to the ground.

311
00:25:58,259 --> 00:26:03,420
When I hit the ground, the flubber will
send me right back up unharmed. Watch.

312
00:26:11,315 --> 00:26:14,020
- Ta-ta, my love.
- Are you nuts?

313
00:26:14,151 --> 00:26:17,734
- I`ll be right back.
- Phillip!

314
00:26:17,863 --> 00:26:19,274
Ah!

315
00:26:21,868 --> 00:26:25,450
- Ouch.
- Phillip, are you hurt?

316
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,656
Just my pride.

317
00:26:27,749 --> 00:26:31,450
Well, if you think that
you are going to get my sympathy,
you are wasting your time.

318
00:26:31,586 --> 00:26:34,421
Ooh! We are finished!

319
00:26:36,049 --> 00:26:38,836
Sara.

320
00:26:38,927 --> 00:26:41,964
Oh!

321
00:26:57,614 --> 00:26:59,737
Junior`s home.

322
00:27:02,035 --> 00:27:06,448
Dad? Dad!

323
00:27:07,791 --> 00:27:09,665
Dad?

324
00:27:13,213 --> 00:27:17,543
Somebody in your organization
screwed up big time.

325
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:19,924
I got thrown off
the basketball team.

326
00:27:20,012 --> 00:27:25,683
I flunked chemistry.
I`m on, uh, academic probation.

327
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,681
- How did this happen?
- I`m supposed to get A`s.

328
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:31,684
- At least, that`s what I was told.
- The only reason...

329
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:34,224
I loaned this "jerknut"
college money...

330
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:38,862
was so he could get straight A`s
and go to Harvard Business School.

331
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:41,446
- This isn`t supposed to happen.
- Yes, sir.

332
00:27:41,535 --> 00:27:44,987
We talked to the, uh, that Brainard guy,
the chemistry professor.

333
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:47,792
Now, either he did not
understand us, or he forgot.

334
00:27:47,917 --> 00:27:50,372
The-The boy knew we were having
persuasion problems, sir.

335
00:27:50,503 --> 00:27:54,501
I have a science requirement,
you morons!

336
00:27:54,632 --> 00:27:56,708
Quiet.

337
00:27:56,843 --> 00:27:58,966
We`ll have to get the "F"
changed to an "A."

338
00:28:00,639 --> 00:28:04,304
It won`t work. This guy? He
doesn`t live in the real world.

339
00:28:04,434 --> 00:28:06,842
- He has principles.
- Get something on him...

340
00:28:06,979 --> 00:28:09,849
that we can use to force him
to change the kid`s grade.

341
00:28:09,982 --> 00:28:13,565
When a man says he has
principles, what he means is...

342
00:28:13,694 --> 00:28:16,363
he can`t be bought cheap.

343
00:28:40,889 --> 00:28:44,056
Hmm. Hmm.

344
00:28:50,274 --> 00:28:52,433
Adding 500 milligrams...

345
00:28:52,568 --> 00:28:55,938
crystallized flubber
to common hand cream.

346
00:28:56,072 --> 00:28:57,946
Stirring in solution.

347
00:29:00,201 --> 00:29:02,075
Hmm.

348
00:29:08,418 --> 00:29:11,585
Hmm. I just need one
spherical test subject.

349
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:16,543
Mm. Perfect.

350
00:29:17,678 --> 00:29:19,718
Yeah. Now, about two--

351
00:29:24,269 --> 00:29:27,223
Applying flubber
in a solution...

352
00:29:27,355 --> 00:29:30,890
externally to golf ball.

353
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:36,737
All right. Very good.

354
00:29:36,823 --> 00:29:40,074
Evenly over the entire surface.

355
00:29:40,202 --> 00:29:42,076
Kinetic test number one.

356
00:29:43,998 --> 00:29:46,323
Oh. Oh! Oh!

357
00:29:50,046 --> 00:29:52,454
Ooh! Ah!

358
00:29:58,638 --> 00:30:01,509
Are you all right?

359
00:30:01,641 --> 00:30:03,930
All right.

360
00:30:04,019 --> 00:30:07,435
Applying light coating
of flubber...

361
00:30:07,564 --> 00:30:09,604
to surface of bowling ball.

362
00:30:09,691 --> 00:30:11,601
All right.

363
00:30:11,735 --> 00:30:14,357
Oh. Very good.

364
00:30:16,032 --> 00:30:18,357
- Right in the head.
- That golf ball was really moving.

365
00:30:18,492 --> 00:30:20,366
- How`d he do that?
- I don`t know.

366
00:30:20,495 --> 00:30:23,449
Commencing kinetic energy
test number two.

367
00:30:23,581 --> 00:30:27,449
Controlling horizontal momentum.

368
00:30:27,585 --> 00:30:29,459
Commencing now.

369
00:30:32,007 --> 00:30:34,332
Hit the deck!

370
00:30:45,688 --> 00:30:48,559
This definitely has applications
in the field of sports.

371
00:30:48,691 --> 00:30:50,850
Ho, ho, ho! Yes!

372
00:30:57,534 --> 00:30:59,657
Oh!

373
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:11,539
What?

374
00:31:21,017 --> 00:31:22,891
Fluid flubber...

375
00:31:23,019 --> 00:31:26,353
with a convenient
spray applicator.

376
00:31:27,899 --> 00:31:29,892
It`s clogged. Hmm.

377
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:41,245
- You seen enough?
- Plenty.

378
00:31:43,499 --> 00:31:47,544
All right, after the bowling
ball hits, we break for the car.

379
00:31:49,046 --> 00:31:51,716
Oh, wait a minute.
You can adjust it.

380
00:31:55,553 --> 00:31:57,712
Go!

381
00:32:27,462 --> 00:32:29,371
Oh, damn! Oh!

382
00:32:31,216 --> 00:32:33,375
- Yes! Weebo?
- Yes, sir?

383
00:32:33,468 --> 00:32:35,710
- It`s gonna work.
- I hope so.

384
00:32:35,804 --> 00:32:38,176
Now, let me show you how.

385
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,684
I connected the accelerator
to a sliding shutter.

386
00:32:42,812 --> 00:32:45,766
If I press down on the accelerator,
it releases the gamma rays,

387
00:32:45,856 --> 00:32:47,814
and that increases the thrust.

388
00:32:47,942 --> 00:32:50,777
Ah. Listen to that baby chirp.

389
00:32:50,903 --> 00:32:54,736
Now, the steering wheel
controls lateral motion.

390
00:32:54,824 --> 00:32:56,864
- Mm-hmm.
- If you turn right,

391
00:32:56,993 --> 00:32:58,867
- Okay.
- it`ll steer right.

392
00:32:58,995 --> 00:33:02,162
- Ah! Turns right.
- Turn the wheel left, it steers left.

393
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:05,292
So, it functions a lot like
a normal automatic shift...

394
00:33:05,377 --> 00:33:07,666
- with drive, park, neutral, reverse.
- Yes, yes, yes, yes.

395
00:33:07,796 --> 00:33:10,632
- It`s that easy. See, Weebo?
- Professor!

396
00:33:10,716 --> 00:33:12,958
- Weebo?
- Help! Let me out!

397
00:33:13,094 --> 00:33:15,419
- Oh, Weebo!
- Professor!

398
00:33:15,513 --> 00:33:17,589
- Oh!
- What were you doing in there?

399
00:33:17,682 --> 00:33:20,967
- Flirting with the alternator.
- Hope you didn`t touch anything.

400
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:24,679
It`s not the time to play. We`re about
to make a major breakthrough.

401
00:33:24,814 --> 00:33:27,602
Okay, here we go.

402
00:33:27,692 --> 00:33:30,397
Yeah. I think we`re ready.

403
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:33,653
- Weebo?
- Yes?

404
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:37,608
What do you say
we take her for a ride?

405
00:33:37,703 --> 00:33:40,657
- Fly me to the moon!
- That`s it. That`s the spirit.

406
00:33:40,748 --> 00:33:43,951
We`ll fly over to Sara`s house,
park this baby on the roof,

407
00:33:44,043 --> 00:33:45,952
and then maybe she`s
gonna change her tune.

408
00:33:46,045 --> 00:33:48,619
You know, maybe you should
just go without me.

409
00:33:48,715 --> 00:33:51,336
- Why?
- Because I get carsick.

410
00:33:51,426 --> 00:33:53,465
- Oh, come on.
You`re not gonna blow chips.
- No?

411
00:33:53,553 --> 00:33:55,676
- You don`t have a stomach.
- I have a queasy gyro.

412
00:33:55,805 --> 00:33:59,934
Now get over it. This is not
about cars. This is about Sara.

413
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:04,010
- Now get in here.
- No!

414
00:34:04,106 --> 00:34:06,015
- Now.
- All right.

415
00:34:07,401 --> 00:34:10,687
Oh! We`re fine now.

416
00:34:10,779 --> 00:34:13,187
- Ah! Out into the world.
- Okay, here we go.

417
00:34:13,324 --> 00:34:16,907
Look at this! Let`s see
what this baby will do!

418
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,953
Oh! It works!

419
00:34:22,083 --> 00:34:24,040
- Yes, it does.
- I`m psyched!

420
00:34:24,127 --> 00:34:27,710
Oh, boy.

421
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:29,713
- You know what this means, Weebo?
- What?

422
00:34:29,841 --> 00:34:32,546
I`ll never have
to buy tyres again.

423
00:34:32,636 --> 00:34:35,092
Ah. Let`s see what`s
on the radio, Weebo.

424
00:34:35,222 --> 00:34:38,674
Ho! Latin!
Bam ba-bum, ba-bum, ba-bum

425
00:34:38,767 --> 00:34:42,053
Bum ba-bum ba-bum
Hey!

426
00:34:42,146 --> 00:34:44,103
Bum-bum be-bum bum

427
00:34:53,241 --> 00:34:55,732
Right turn.

428
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:58,401
Whoa! Yes!

429
00:34:58,497 --> 00:35:01,913
Huh? Huh? Oh!

430
00:35:04,628 --> 00:35:07,166
Ah! We`re fine.

431
00:35:09,884 --> 00:35:11,960
Whoa! Oh.

432
00:35:12,094 --> 00:35:16,507
- It`s all right. I saw it.
- I don`t think so.

433
00:35:16,641 --> 00:35:18,930
Weebo, there is
nothing to worry about.

434
00:35:21,354 --> 00:35:23,762
Oh-- Mayday!

435
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,520
Come on. Easy.

436
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:36,451
Oh! Sorry.
First-time flyer. Shh!

437
00:35:56,141 --> 00:35:58,893
I`m very sorry!

438
00:35:59,019 --> 00:36:02,602
Hang on, Weebo!
Oh! Ha, ha, ha! Oh!

439
00:36:02,689 --> 00:36:06,141
Whoa! Oh! Oh, Weebo!

440
00:36:06,276 --> 00:36:08,316
Oh, now, we`re cookin`!

441
00:36:08,404 --> 00:36:10,313
Whoa!

442
00:36:14,827 --> 00:36:19,240
Oh!

443
00:36:21,876 --> 00:36:23,750
Oh! Yes!

444
00:36:30,552 --> 00:36:33,008
Oh, Weebo. Come on up.

445
00:36:33,096 --> 00:36:35,552
Please. You`ve gotta see this.

446
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:40,184
Wow! ls this
what you call heaven?

447
00:36:40,271 --> 00:36:43,640
Almost. Look at it.

448
00:36:45,026 --> 00:36:47,861
The whole world below
and beyond.

449
00:36:47,987 --> 00:36:50,561
- It`s beautiful.
- The solitude up here.

450
00:36:50,698 --> 00:36:54,032
The stillness.

451
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,118
- The silence.
- Uh-oh.

452
00:37:02,753 --> 00:37:06,039
Silly me turned it off.
Turns right back on.

453
00:37:06,131 --> 00:37:08,967
The shutter`s jammed probably,
Weebo. We`re okay.

454
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:15,883
Start right up.
Oh, please turn over!

455
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:21,309
For the love of Newton,
turn over!

456
00:37:23,692 --> 00:37:25,768
Abandon ship!

457
00:37:27,028 --> 00:37:30,896
Oh!

458
00:37:30,991 --> 00:37:33,067
Yes!

459
00:37:40,292 --> 00:37:42,166
It`s such a pleasure
to spend time with you...

460
00:37:42,295 --> 00:37:44,501
without having Brainard
hovering above us.

461
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,504
Mmm.

462
00:37:46,632 --> 00:37:49,966
- More wine?
- No. No, thank you.

463
00:37:50,094 --> 00:37:52,004
I have to say good night.

464
00:37:52,138 --> 00:37:54,427
I have a busy,
busy day tomorrow.

465
00:37:58,478 --> 00:38:00,554
Mmm.

466
00:38:00,647 --> 00:38:03,814
Rutland would die to have you.

467
00:38:03,942 --> 00:38:07,146
We`d be together
with nothing but time.

468
00:38:13,744 --> 00:38:15,784
Sara?

469
00:38:20,001 --> 00:38:22,124
Mmm.

470
00:38:27,217 --> 00:38:29,423
I`m sorry, Wilson.

471
00:38:29,511 --> 00:38:33,841
Forget it. It`s okay.
We have lots of time.

472
00:38:33,974 --> 00:38:38,802
Listen, l`m-l`m driving up
on Thursday to Rutland for the game.

473
00:38:38,896 --> 00:38:42,265
- I`ll see you there.
- Should I make dinner reservations?

474
00:38:42,358 --> 00:38:45,063
Since Rutland is going
to lose, l`ll pay.

475
00:38:45,194 --> 00:38:48,361
All right. If your team wins,
you can buy me dinner.

476
00:38:48,489 --> 00:38:51,526
If your team loses, we go up to
the mountains for the weekend.

477
00:38:53,036 --> 00:38:57,912
- Mmm--
- Cad!

478
00:38:59,459 --> 00:39:03,160
- Do we have a bet?
- I`ll think about it.

479
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:10,253
I can`t lose. She`s mine!

480
00:39:10,388 --> 00:39:12,676
Sir lsaac.

481
00:39:16,269 --> 00:39:18,178
Out!

482
00:39:22,275 --> 00:39:24,897
All right.

483
00:39:25,028 --> 00:39:28,860
One more time. What happened?

484
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:31,945
He took a golf ball,
he rubbed this cream on it,

485
00:39:32,077 --> 00:39:35,612
and then the golf ball
took off and...

486
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:37,622
popped Smith in the head.

487
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,873
- Several times.
- Mm-hmm.

488
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:44,706
- I got hit with a bowling ball.
- Repeatedly.

489
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:48,210
- Were you drinking?
- No.

490
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:51,511
Two beers at dinner.
Wesson had a white wine.

491
00:39:51,598 --> 00:39:53,721
- With dinner.
- Right.

492
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:58,595
It`s this stuff
he`s got, sir. It`s--

493
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:01,897
I don`t know what it is. I don`t
know where it comes from, but...

494
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:09,616
it will give you
one heck of a headache.

495
00:40:09,742 --> 00:40:13,325
Oh, goodness.

496
00:40:14,956 --> 00:40:17,198
I-l wish I could
make you feel better.

497
00:40:17,292 --> 00:40:20,625
Hmm. So do l.

498
00:40:20,754 --> 00:40:24,004
Well, maybe l`m old-fashioned,
but I believe...

499
00:40:24,132 --> 00:40:26,421
a woman should love a man
for what he is,

500
00:40:26,551 --> 00:40:29,256
and not for what
she wants him to be.

501
00:40:30,556 --> 00:40:32,762
Thanks for the
sentiment, Weebo, but...

502
00:40:32,891 --> 00:40:36,724
this is really not an area you`re
qualified to offer perspective on.

503
00:40:36,812 --> 00:40:40,098
Well, I don`t have much of
a smile, but I do have a brain.

504
00:40:41,275 --> 00:40:43,766
I have to deal with this alone.

505
00:40:43,903 --> 00:40:45,777
It`s a human matter,

506
00:40:45,905 --> 00:40:47,981
not for computers.

507
00:40:48,116 --> 00:40:50,572
It`s for people.

508
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:53,780
- Good night, Weebo.
- Good night, Professor.

509
00:42:36,188 --> 00:42:38,062
Hmm.

510
00:42:54,916 --> 00:42:57,490
- I got it!
- Oh, no!

511
00:42:59,713 --> 00:43:02,917
I gotta turn this thing off.
This is so embarrassing.

512
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:06,419
Weebo, I just had
this amazing dream!

513
00:43:06,512 --> 00:43:09,003
- Weebo!
- Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry!

514
00:43:10,016 --> 00:43:13,183
Weebo! Weebo!

515
00:43:13,311 --> 00:43:15,849
- Weebo! Wake up!
- Mmm.

516
00:43:18,525 --> 00:43:22,523
- I`ve solved all our problems.
- I`m all ears.

517
00:43:22,654 --> 00:43:27,115
Flubber is going
to the basketball game.

518
00:43:27,201 --> 00:43:29,608
- Basketball?
- Yes!

519
00:44:02,571 --> 00:44:04,481
Testing, testing.

520
00:44:23,802 --> 00:44:26,174
Applying a thin layer
of fluid flubber...

521
00:44:26,263 --> 00:44:28,932
to synthetic leather surface
of basketball.

522
00:44:30,934 --> 00:44:33,058
Application complete.

523
00:44:49,829 --> 00:44:51,739
Wow!

524
00:44:55,168 --> 00:44:56,711
Oops.

525
00:44:59,423 --> 00:45:01,297
Two points.

526
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:18,562
Implementing plan "B."

527
00:45:18,693 --> 00:45:21,564
Very tight. Tight.

528
00:45:21,696 --> 00:45:24,532
And careful, careful,
careful, careful.

529
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,909
Secondary flubber experiment.

530
00:45:35,002 --> 00:45:37,328
Control elements: bungee cord,

531
00:45:37,463 --> 00:45:41,413
three-to-one elasticity ratio,
fifty-pound ballast.

532
00:45:41,509 --> 00:45:43,917
Commencing now.

533
00:45:44,012 --> 00:45:45,921
Wish me luck.

534
00:45:47,265 --> 00:45:50,800
Oh! Whoa!

535
00:45:52,604 --> 00:45:54,811
Yes!

536
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:57,146
Ha, ha!

537
00:45:57,276 --> 00:46:00,976
Whoa! I got it!

538
00:46:05,326 --> 00:46:08,695
Oh! Bungee! Bungee!

539
00:46:08,830 --> 00:46:10,703
Oh! Oh!

540
00:46:10,832 --> 00:46:13,157
Uh, help.

541
00:46:13,293 --> 00:46:15,451
Uh, yeow!

542
00:46:29,351 --> 00:46:31,261
It worked!

543
00:46:32,938 --> 00:46:35,061
Yes!

544
00:46:35,191 --> 00:46:37,065
End test.

545
00:46:45,368 --> 00:46:49,496
Did you fully fix the flubber
on each tack before we painted?

546
00:46:49,581 --> 00:46:52,452
Excuse me, Darth Vader,
but what did you say?

547
00:46:52,542 --> 00:46:56,540
Did you fully fix a 15%
flubber solution to each tack
before Weber started painting?

548
00:46:56,672 --> 00:46:59,542
- Yes, l`m positive.
- Excellent.

549
00:46:59,675 --> 00:47:02,000
And how long does it take
the paint to wear off?

550
00:47:02,136 --> 00:47:04,461
- Uh, 30 minutes.
- Be a little suspicious...

551
00:47:04,555 --> 00:47:06,512
if the flubber started
working immediately.

552
00:47:06,641 --> 00:47:10,686
- Uh, isn`t this cheating?
- No, it`s not cheating.
It`s equalizing.

553
00:47:10,812 --> 00:47:13,219
You`ve seen the team. They
should have their own telethon.

554
00:47:13,356 --> 00:47:15,515
Come on! We`ve got
to win this game.

555
00:47:15,650 --> 00:47:18,604
I`ve gotta do it to prove to
Sara that flubber really works.

556
00:47:18,737 --> 00:47:22,604
I`m gonna do it right under
Wilson Croft`s nose.

557
00:47:22,741 --> 00:47:24,615
Don`t fail me.

558
00:47:35,546 --> 00:47:37,171
- Weebo.
- Yes?

559
00:47:37,256 --> 00:47:39,498
- While l`m out, you`re in charge, okay?
- Okay.

560
00:47:39,592 --> 00:47:42,048
- No phone calls to Russia again.
- I think that was Weber.

561
00:47:42,136 --> 00:47:46,549
Oh! Make sure the flubber
stays in the tank.

562
00:47:46,683 --> 00:47:49,091
- Got it.
- Under no circumstances
are you to release it.

563
00:47:49,227 --> 00:47:51,101
- Of course.
- Because you know what would happen.

564
00:47:51,229 --> 00:47:54,729
- Ho, ho, ho.
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir, I understand.

565
00:47:54,858 --> 00:47:58,274
- Promise?
- Have no fear.

566
00:47:58,404 --> 00:48:01,358
That`s my girl.

567
00:48:01,449 --> 00:48:05,233
Go Medfield!

568
00:48:05,369 --> 00:48:07,611
Okay.

569
00:48:07,830 --> 00:48:10,915
Good evening, everybody,
and welcome to Rutland Arena...

570
00:48:11,042 --> 00:48:14,079
for the 86th meeting of the Rutland
Rangers and the Medfield Squirrels.

571
00:48:14,212 --> 00:48:16,418
Rutland, if they can just
stay awake, should be able...

572
00:48:16,506 --> 00:48:18,665
to steamroll the Squirrels
here tonight at the--

573
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,089
All right, Squirrels,

574
00:48:21,178 --> 00:48:24,381
Iisten up here now.

575
00:48:24,473 --> 00:48:28,886
Okay, Rutland may have us
in height and reach,

576
00:48:28,978 --> 00:48:31,350
weight and power,

577
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:33,639
agility, speed and talent.

578
00:48:33,774 --> 00:48:36,775
They have the advantage
on offence...

579
00:48:36,903 --> 00:48:39,145
and defence.

580
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:42,115
Sure, they`re-they`re
better coached,

581
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:44,193
better trained,

582
00:48:44,327 --> 00:48:49,618
and their will to win is
unmatched in the conference.

583
00:48:49,708 --> 00:48:52,377
They`re undefeated
in their last...

584
00:48:52,502 --> 00:48:56,417
one hundred and eight games.

585
00:48:56,507 --> 00:49:00,754
But that doesn`t mean we can`t
whip these guys. Right?

586
00:49:16,778 --> 00:49:18,985
- Yeah!
- Ohh!

587
00:49:22,492 --> 00:49:25,162
Rutland! Rangers!

588
00:49:25,287 --> 00:49:28,573
Rutland! Rangers!

589
00:49:41,471 --> 00:49:44,342
Okay, flubber, it`s time
that you and l...

590
00:49:44,432 --> 00:49:46,342
got to know each other.

591
00:49:48,061 --> 00:49:51,264
Ow!

592
00:49:55,402 --> 00:49:58,024
Another easy basket
for the Rutland Rangers.

593
00:49:58,113 --> 00:50:02,028
They have built up a commanding
lead in the first half.

594
00:50:08,875 --> 00:50:11,081
- Evening, Sara.
- Excuse me?

595
00:50:11,211 --> 00:50:13,536
What a coincidence.

596
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:21,298
Dunk it! Dunk it!

597
00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:23,387
Take it!

598
00:50:26,101 --> 00:50:28,059
Come on, you guys!
You gotta do--

599
00:50:28,187 --> 00:50:30,476
Not now, Ernie! Not now!

600
00:50:30,606 --> 00:50:32,480
Go Medfield!

601
00:50:34,735 --> 00:50:38,899
- Ow!
- Oh, sorry. Sorry, Wilson.

602
00:50:46,456 --> 00:50:48,579
See if you can get me
another ten grand on Rutland.

603
00:50:52,838 --> 00:50:55,922
- You got a problem, Bennett?
- You`re betting against my team?

604
00:50:56,050 --> 00:50:59,750
It`s not your team. They
threw you off, remember that?

605
00:51:04,350 --> 00:51:06,675
Ooh. Oh, baby.
That`s gotta hurt.

606
00:51:06,811 --> 00:51:09,646
He fouled him!
He threw his hip into that!

607
00:51:16,947 --> 00:51:20,897
Flubber? Flubber!
Where are you?

608
00:51:27,708 --> 00:51:30,199
Mambo

609
00:51:38,386 --> 00:51:40,295
Mambo!

610
00:51:42,223 --> 00:51:44,430
Yeah!

611
00:51:44,517 --> 00:51:49,643
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

612
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:52,852
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey!

613
00:53:20,953 --> 00:53:22,826
Yeah!

614
00:53:45,562 --> 00:53:47,436
Yeah!

615
00:53:48,982 --> 00:53:51,770
Welcome back to Rutland Arena
for half number two.

616
00:53:51,902 --> 00:53:55,105
The Medfield Squirrels tonight
are getting their nuts buried,

617
00:53:55,239 --> 00:53:57,564
trailing by 51 at intermission.

618
00:53:57,658 --> 00:54:02,735
If Coach Barker has any sense,
he has to be thinking forfeiture--

619
00:54:02,830 --> 00:54:05,701
...for half number two.

620
00:54:05,833 --> 00:54:07,873
Come on, boys.
Expect the unexpected.

621
00:54:08,002 --> 00:54:10,494
Dale. Come on now, son.
You can do it.

622
00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:13,880
Come on, Bruce. There we go.
Werner, be a flying squirrel!

623
00:54:14,009 --> 00:54:17,460
Bart, the impossible`s possible.
Come on, Lawrence!

624
00:54:17,596 --> 00:54:19,719
- Rodents rule!
- Loser!

625
00:54:27,523 --> 00:54:29,397
Show time.

626
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:34,112
Keep going! Open!

627
00:54:37,033 --> 00:54:38,907
Oh!

628
00:54:49,379 --> 00:54:51,917
- Yeah! Get `em!
- Come on!
- Defence, defence!

629
00:54:54,677 --> 00:54:58,176
- Come on!
- That`s pretty good.

630
00:54:58,264 --> 00:54:59,888
Yeah!

631
00:55:01,559 --> 00:55:05,177
Okay! Go! Beat them! Let`s go!

632
00:55:12,153 --> 00:55:14,858
Oh!

633
00:55:19,995 --> 00:55:22,202
- Yes! Yes!
- Gosh! We`ve never--

634
00:55:22,289 --> 00:55:26,702
Yeah! Did you see that?
Did you see that, Dad? Yes!

635
00:55:32,592 --> 00:55:34,501
What the--

636
00:55:38,723 --> 00:55:41,510
We did it!

637
00:55:41,601 --> 00:55:43,973
Wow! Wow!

638
00:55:44,104 --> 00:55:47,022
Hey, are you blind? They`re doin`
something illegal out there.

639
00:55:47,107 --> 00:55:50,559
Coach, nowhere in the rule book does
it say anything about jumpin` too high.

640
00:55:50,652 --> 00:55:54,271
Now sit down!

641
00:55:54,406 --> 00:55:57,111
Looks like a lonely weekend
in the mountains for you, Croft.

642
00:55:57,243 --> 00:55:59,235
Come on, Squirrels!

643
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:14,635
Yea!

644
00:56:14,761 --> 00:56:17,134
Did you see that, Croft?

645
00:56:23,812 --> 00:56:25,852
Down, down!

646
00:56:29,318 --> 00:56:31,276
Yes!

647
00:56:35,408 --> 00:56:37,282
Yeah, yeah!

648
00:56:44,668 --> 00:56:46,577
A tack.

649
00:56:53,385 --> 00:56:55,959
Oh. Dale!

650
00:56:56,055 --> 00:56:58,297
No!

651
00:56:58,432 --> 00:57:01,303
Dale! Not the tacks!

652
00:57:01,436 --> 00:57:04,306
- I don`t know.
- Okay, now, this game is not over yet.

653
00:57:04,439 --> 00:57:06,728
You just wanna steal the ball
and then score!

654
00:57:06,858 --> 00:57:08,767
Pardon me, boys.
Educator coming through.

655
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:12,110
Coach, I know very little about
basketball, but I do know chemistry.

656
00:57:12,197 --> 00:57:15,151
And l-l believe that Dale is having
a problem, not with motivations,

657
00:57:15,242 --> 00:57:17,994
but with some sort of adhesive buildup
on the bottom of his shoes.

658
00:57:18,078 --> 00:57:20,783
- Do you have any ethyl alcohol?
- What?

659
00:57:20,873 --> 00:57:23,660
- Excuse me. Hello, Dale.
- Coach.
- Oh, hello, Professor Brainard.

660
00:57:23,751 --> 00:57:25,909
- May I see your sole?
- Wh--

661
00:57:26,045 --> 00:57:29,496
- I mean, the bottom of your shoe.
- Oh, oh.

662
00:57:29,632 --> 00:57:33,760
Now, the game`s not over yet. Keep your
chin up and your potential energy high.

663
00:57:33,886 --> 00:57:36,175
`Cause you know why, Dale?

664
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:39,927
Son of a--

665
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:43,559
Get the ball.
Jump with all your soul.

666
00:57:43,688 --> 00:57:45,598
B-- But l`m
on this end, sir. I--

667
00:57:45,732 --> 00:57:47,725
Jump! Or l`ll flunk you.

668
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:50,351
- Uh-- What?
- You heard me.

669
00:57:50,487 --> 00:57:54,320
Jump, or l`ll flunk you out
of my department for good.

670
00:57:55,743 --> 00:57:57,652
Okay.

671
00:57:59,956 --> 00:58:02,032
I think that`s
a little harsh, but--

672
00:58:02,125 --> 00:58:05,375
- Jump!
- A-T-T-A-C-K!

673
00:58:05,503 --> 00:58:09,122
The Medfield Squirrels are trying
to complete this astonishing comeback.

674
00:58:09,257 --> 00:58:13,966
- Nice and patient, Rutland.
Plenty of time, baby.
- Rutland has the lead
with the clock winding down.

675
00:58:14,096 --> 00:58:16,551
These rodents have fought
their little hearts out tonight,

676
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:20,223
but it looks like the Squirrels
are gonna come up a couple
of nuts short of a bushel.

677
00:58:20,310 --> 00:58:23,228
Playing keep-away are the Rangers.
Here`s a wide-open "J" by Hatch.

678
00:58:23,314 --> 00:58:25,223
Jump, Dale! Jump!

679
00:58:26,984 --> 00:58:29,392
Jepner is soaring
into the air, makes the steal.

680
00:58:29,529 --> 00:58:33,573
Look at him go! Jepner, with wings
on his shoes, soaring to the other end!

681
00:58:33,658 --> 00:58:36,066
He`s all over it.
He dives. He`s through!

682
00:58:36,202 --> 00:58:40,070
And Medfield upsets Rutland
on an incredible play by Dale Jepner!

683
00:58:40,207 --> 00:58:42,246
- No!
- And the Squirrels are going nuts.

684
00:58:42,334 --> 00:58:44,742
- Yeah!
- We won!
- Oh, we did it!
- Foul!

685
00:58:44,878 --> 00:58:47,120
- We did it!
- Foul! Foul!

686
00:58:47,256 --> 00:58:50,921
Since when is it within the
rules for a player to accompany
the ball through the hoop?

687
00:58:51,051 --> 00:58:54,302
Oh, I don`t know. Come on.
I owe you dinner.

688
00:58:55,639 --> 00:58:58,261
- Sara?
- Good night, Phillip.

689
00:58:58,351 --> 00:59:00,343
Good night.

690
00:59:03,398 --> 00:59:05,936
Brainard had something
to do with this.

691
00:59:06,025 --> 00:59:09,893
It-lt`s the same stuff we saw
the other night over at his house.

692
00:59:09,988 --> 00:59:11,613
Right.

693
00:59:14,493 --> 00:59:18,621
I don`t know how, but l`m absolutely
certain your team cheated.

694
00:59:18,706 --> 00:59:20,994
Oh, you`re just being
a sore loser.

695
00:59:21,125 --> 00:59:25,419
Sara, m-m-may I speak
to you for a moment? Alone?

696
00:59:25,504 --> 00:59:28,078
What you have to say to her,
you can say to both of us,

697
00:59:28,174 --> 00:59:30,747
if you can remember.

698
00:59:30,843 --> 00:59:32,801
Sara?

699
00:59:33,930 --> 00:59:36,635
- Flubber.
- Flubber?

700
00:59:36,725 --> 00:59:39,394
Sounds like baby shampoo.

701
00:59:42,272 --> 00:59:44,431
Flubber is what won the game.

702
00:59:44,524 --> 00:59:46,731
That amazing aerial ballet...

703
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:49,398
was because I flubberized
the boys` shoes.

704
00:59:49,530 --> 00:59:52,815
A little on the bottom-- Whoo!

705
00:59:52,950 --> 00:59:56,284
You are remarkable.

706
00:59:59,707 --> 01:00:01,664
Sara?

707
01:00:01,793 --> 01:00:04,498
Good night, Phillip.

708
01:00:04,587 --> 01:00:07,125
Watch yourself.

709
01:00:08,633 --> 01:00:11,504
Now what do we have to do
to get you to take a hint?

710
01:00:11,636 --> 01:00:13,510
It`s over, Phillip. You lost.

711
01:00:13,639 --> 01:00:16,046
Go home. Play with your rubber.

712
01:00:45,672 --> 01:00:49,006
What kind of car does
that Brainard fellow drive?

713
01:00:49,093 --> 01:00:51,880
Old T-Bird. Why?

714
01:00:52,012 --> 01:00:55,512
- I just saw it.
- So?

715
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:58,007
It was flying.

716
01:00:59,645 --> 01:01:02,730
You heard me. Flying.

717
01:01:11,116 --> 01:01:13,524
- Hey, who won?
- We did.

718
01:01:14,912 --> 01:01:17,403
Um, Professor,

719
01:01:17,498 --> 01:01:19,787
why the long face?

720
01:01:21,919 --> 01:01:27,424
- I think you know why.
- Would it be a Sara issue?

721
01:01:29,343 --> 01:01:31,751
Wish I understood human beings.

722
01:01:33,181 --> 01:01:36,348
Wish I understood women.

723
01:01:36,476 --> 01:01:40,260
Wish I understood emotions and passions.
I wish I understood any of that.

724
01:01:40,397 --> 01:01:44,264
If I did, I wouldn`t have had to spend
my entire life in a laboratory...

725
01:01:44,401 --> 01:01:46,524
trying to figure out
how the world works.

726
01:01:46,653 --> 01:01:49,524
I would`ve been out in the world
trying to figure out why it works.

727
01:01:53,494 --> 01:01:55,570
I know I love her, Weebo.

728
01:01:57,748 --> 01:02:01,283
Every neuron in my limbic system
is saturated with phenylethylamine.

729
01:02:01,419 --> 01:02:05,464
That triggers euphoria,
elation, exhilaration.

730
01:02:05,590 --> 01:02:07,666
Truth is, Weebo,

731
01:02:07,801 --> 01:02:11,846
I`m not absent-minded because
l`m selfish or crazy or--

732
01:02:11,972 --> 01:02:14,926
or inconsiderate.

733
01:02:15,017 --> 01:02:17,472
I`m absent-minded because l`m
in love with Sara.

734
01:02:17,603 --> 01:02:19,477
Oh, Professor.

735
01:02:20,898 --> 01:02:23,471
That doesn`t matter any more,

736
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:27,482
`cause I don`t get
any more chances with her.

737
01:02:27,613 --> 01:02:31,825
That`s not true. There`s always another
chance. I mean, you never know, right?

738
01:02:31,951 --> 01:02:33,944
Probably just as well
that it`s over.

739
01:02:34,037 --> 01:02:37,620
- Why?
- She has to move on.

740
01:02:37,707 --> 01:02:40,377
- Oh.
- I`m not right for her.

741
01:02:40,502 --> 01:02:42,661
- But you knew that, didn`t you, Weebo?
- Huh?

742
01:02:42,796 --> 01:02:45,501
You never wanted me
to marry her.

743
01:02:46,842 --> 01:02:50,710
Well, you were right.
I wasn`t right for her.

744
01:02:50,846 --> 01:02:53,847
You`re the one for me, Weebo.

745
01:02:53,933 --> 01:02:55,926
Just the two of us.

746
01:02:57,061 --> 01:02:59,350
And flubber makes three.

747
01:03:00,940 --> 01:03:03,645
- Good night, Weeb.
- Good night.

748
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:07,194
Uh, Professor--

749
01:03:12,744 --> 01:03:14,784
And this is the God`s truth:

750
01:03:14,913 --> 01:03:17,665
I want him to have
what he wants,

751
01:03:17,750 --> 01:03:20,502
even if it means you
instead of me.

752
01:03:41,650 --> 01:03:43,559
Ooh!

753
01:03:55,373 --> 01:03:59,074
Sara? Sara, it`s me.

754
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:02,081
- Weebo?
- May I come in?

755
01:04:02,172 --> 01:04:04,745
Oh, l`m sorry
to wake you like this,

756
01:04:04,883 --> 01:04:09,047
but I can`t ring the doorbell.

757
01:04:09,137 --> 01:04:11,593
- Is everything okay with Phillip?
- Oh, yeah.

758
01:04:11,723 --> 01:04:14,475
It`s not
a conventional emergency.

759
01:04:14,601 --> 01:04:18,434
Oh, Phillip would be very angry
if he knew I left,

760
01:04:18,564 --> 01:04:20,853
but I have
to show you something.

761
01:04:20,983 --> 01:04:23,439
Do you have a minute?

762
01:04:23,527 --> 01:04:25,567
Listen.

763
01:04:25,655 --> 01:04:29,783
I know I love her, Weebo.

764
01:04:29,909 --> 01:04:33,444
Every neuron in my limbic system
is saturated with phenylethylamine.

765
01:04:33,580 --> 01:04:37,364
That triggers euphoria,
elation, exhilaration.

766
01:04:37,501 --> 01:04:40,704
Truth is, Weebo, l`m not absent-minded
because l`m selfish...

767
01:04:40,837 --> 01:04:44,538
or crazy or-- or inconsiderate.

768
01:04:46,010 --> 01:04:48,964
I`m absent-minded because l`m
in love with Sara.

769
01:04:49,096 --> 01:04:50,970
Oh.

770
01:04:56,521 --> 01:04:59,226
And this will be
our little secret.

771
01:05:11,370 --> 01:05:13,991
Phillip.

772
01:05:18,878 --> 01:05:20,787
Oh.

773
01:05:22,632 --> 01:05:25,633
- Sara?
- Uh-huh.

774
01:05:46,198 --> 01:05:49,484
This is it.
This is the solution.

775
01:05:49,577 --> 01:05:52,946
This is how we save the school.

776
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:55,916
That`s what l`ve been saying.
Flubber.

777
01:05:56,042 --> 01:05:58,331
- You saw what it did at the game.
- Yes.

778
01:05:58,419 --> 01:06:00,329
Imagine the line of shoes
we could develop.

779
01:06:00,421 --> 01:06:02,628
Oh, no, no, no, Phillip,
not shoes.

780
01:06:02,757 --> 01:06:04,797
No. Look.

781
01:06:04,926 --> 01:06:07,382
This. Flight.

782
01:06:08,597 --> 01:06:09,925
- Flight?
- Yes.

783
01:06:10,057 --> 01:06:12,215
- Oh, of course.
- A-Air travel.

784
01:06:12,309 --> 01:06:14,302
Oh, Sara! Air travel.

785
01:06:14,436 --> 01:06:16,228
- Yes.
- Oh.

786
01:06:16,355 --> 01:06:19,890
- We`d better sell this
to a car company.
- Oh, Phillip.

787
01:06:35,667 --> 01:06:38,158
- Hey!
- Dr Reynolds.

788
01:06:38,295 --> 01:06:41,830
Professor. It`s a pleasure
to finally meet you.

789
01:06:43,342 --> 01:06:45,750
I believe you know my son.

790
01:06:45,844 --> 01:06:48,762
He used to play basketball
for Medfield.

791
01:06:50,141 --> 01:06:52,714
Lovely old car.

792
01:06:52,810 --> 01:06:56,014
Mind if I take a look
under the hood?

793
01:06:56,147 --> 01:06:58,721
Yes, I do.

794
01:06:58,816 --> 01:07:03,526
And I don`t appreciate you gentlemen
letting yourselves onto my property.

795
01:07:03,655 --> 01:07:07,867
I expected something
more complex.

796
01:07:07,993 --> 01:07:11,742
There`s a lot of money
in your discovery.

797
01:07:11,830 --> 01:07:14,119
Perhaps we could make a deal.

798
01:07:15,918 --> 01:07:19,038
Any discovery I make will belong
to Medfield College.

799
01:07:19,171 --> 01:07:22,256
At the end of the term there isn`t
going to be a Medfield College.

800
01:07:22,341 --> 01:07:26,042
- We`ll see about that.
- You could make a lot of money.

801
01:07:28,264 --> 01:07:32,214
If we were interested in making money,
we wouldn`t have become teachers.

802
01:07:32,352 --> 01:07:35,139
You think you`ll be able to sell
it for what you owe me...

803
01:07:35,230 --> 01:07:37,187
by the end of the term?

804
01:07:37,315 --> 01:07:39,308
We-- We will.

805
01:07:39,443 --> 01:07:43,275
I`ll forget the debt right now.

806
01:07:43,364 --> 01:07:46,483
No, l`m not selling.

807
01:07:46,617 --> 01:07:50,152
When I leave,
I take my offer with me.

808
01:07:50,288 --> 01:07:53,454
We understand.

809
01:07:53,541 --> 01:07:55,450
Good luck.

810
01:07:58,755 --> 01:08:00,961
Come on.

811
01:08:01,049 --> 01:08:02,958
Watch your back, smart guy.

812
01:08:03,051 --> 01:08:05,210
Bad move, Professor.

813
01:08:18,234 --> 01:08:20,143
Good morning!

814
01:08:23,656 --> 01:08:25,696
Pardon me, Mr Seldon.

815
01:08:25,825 --> 01:08:28,696
Are you interested in seeing
a Phillip Brainard?

816
01:08:28,787 --> 01:08:33,413
- Who?
- He`s the college professor
you spoke to on the sixth...

817
01:08:33,542 --> 01:08:35,618
about a brand-new car design.

818
01:08:35,752 --> 01:08:38,956
Tell him l`m busy.
Thank him for the interest.

819
01:08:39,089 --> 01:08:42,209
- And send him a hat.
- Well, he`s here.

820
01:08:42,342 --> 01:08:46,008
He`s right outside.

821
01:09:04,074 --> 01:09:07,075
It`s one of the rarest looks
in watches you can actually own.

822
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:09,449
This watch we have here
is called the scarab.

823
01:09:09,580 --> 01:09:11,489
It has Swiss--

824
01:09:13,626 --> 01:09:15,998
Good night, Weber.

825
01:09:31,811 --> 01:09:34,100
What?

826
01:09:57,881 --> 01:09:59,957
One goon.

827
01:10:01,801 --> 01:10:04,637
Two goons.

828
01:10:28,037 --> 01:10:29,995
- Hey.
- What?

829
01:10:30,081 --> 01:10:33,248
- I think I found it.
- You found it, all right!

830
01:10:40,050 --> 01:10:43,502
- What was that?
- Take two.

831
01:11:01,156 --> 01:11:04,192
Knock, knock!

832
01:11:18,007 --> 01:11:19,881
Kiss me, big boy!

833
01:11:33,857 --> 01:11:36,728
Did you get it?

834
01:11:36,860 --> 01:11:38,734
Yeah.

835
01:11:50,750 --> 01:11:54,084
Oh, l-l`ve never seen
so many zeroes.

836
01:11:54,212 --> 01:11:57,248
When they saw us flying,
they couldn`t wait to write the cheque.

837
01:11:57,340 --> 01:12:00,010
This will save the school,
Phillip.

838
01:12:16,861 --> 01:12:18,770
Weebo?

839
01:12:23,993 --> 01:12:25,903
Weebo?

840
01:12:33,545 --> 01:12:36,250
They took the flubber.

841
01:12:36,340 --> 01:12:38,878
Weebo?

842
01:12:47,226 --> 01:12:49,515
- Weeb--
- Oh.

843
01:12:49,645 --> 01:12:52,315
Um, sh-she`s leaking
battery fluid.

844
01:12:54,025 --> 01:12:56,563
Weebo, it`s me.

845
01:13:00,323 --> 01:13:04,238
Do you have signal?
Do you have audio signal?

846
01:13:04,369 --> 01:13:07,323
Tracking. It`s me.
Professor Brainard.

847
01:13:07,414 --> 01:13:10,534
Focus. Weebo?

848
01:13:10,668 --> 01:13:13,159
Can you see me?

849
01:13:14,714 --> 01:13:17,584
She sees me.

850
01:13:19,635 --> 01:13:22,209
Weebo.

851
01:13:22,347 --> 01:13:25,597
It`s all right. I`ve-l`ve-- I need
to get some sort of extension cord,

852
01:13:25,725 --> 01:13:28,395
something so I can recharge her.

853
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:31,011
I`ve gotta-- I`ve gotta
download her, quick.

854
01:13:31,148 --> 01:13:33,187
Weebo?

855
01:13:33,275 --> 01:13:35,647
It`s all right. It`s okay.

856
01:13:35,736 --> 01:13:39,187
Weebo, can you hear me?

857
01:13:43,119 --> 01:13:45,823
It`s gonna be all right.

858
01:13:45,913 --> 01:13:49,863
It`s like that time you ran into
the wall when I first made you.

859
01:13:49,959 --> 01:13:52,533
We`ll get you upstairs,
onto AC and--

860
01:13:54,881 --> 01:13:57,039
She`s-She`s losing--

861
01:13:57,133 --> 01:14:01,712
She`s losing power.
It`s okay. It`s all right.

862
01:14:01,847 --> 01:14:04,053
We just gotta get you
to the docking station...

863
01:14:04,182 --> 01:14:06,887
till I can make repairs.

864
01:14:14,443 --> 01:14:16,317
Weebo?

865
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:23,072
Goodbye, my friend.

866
01:14:32,129 --> 01:14:35,083
Gone. I have no idea what--

867
01:14:36,425 --> 01:14:38,299
Goodbye.

868
01:15:00,742 --> 01:15:02,949
I don`t know what
to do with her.

869
01:15:05,831 --> 01:15:09,247
What happens to the soul
of a machine, Sara?

870
01:15:13,297 --> 01:15:15,835
Can you fix her?

871
01:15:15,967 --> 01:15:18,505
I can make repairs,

872
01:15:18,636 --> 01:15:22,088
but I can never bring back
the life it was she had.

873
01:15:22,181 --> 01:15:24,969
That`s gone.

874
01:15:25,101 --> 01:15:28,684
I never knew what it was to begin with.
It was some sort of glorious accident.

875
01:15:28,813 --> 01:15:33,808
I kept trying to recreate it
and isolate it and find out what it was.

876
01:15:33,902 --> 01:15:36,310
I never could.

877
01:15:37,948 --> 01:15:40,902
What was that word
she was displaying...

878
01:15:41,035 --> 01:15:43,704
on her screen at the end?

879
01:15:43,829 --> 01:15:46,403
Probably a file name.

880
01:15:46,541 --> 01:15:48,699
Why was she displaying it?

881
01:15:48,835 --> 01:15:52,370
She was damaged-- It`s, you know--
download-- random piece of information.

882
01:15:52,505 --> 01:15:54,664
- I don`t know.
- What was that word?

883
01:15:56,551 --> 01:15:59,007
Oh, can you remember?

884
01:15:59,137 --> 01:16:01,628
No, l--

885
01:16:01,723 --> 01:16:04,677
- Try.
- I am.

886
01:16:10,107 --> 01:16:12,183
It began with "S."

887
01:16:19,784 --> 01:16:23,996
Hello, Phillip. It`s me. Weebo.

888
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:26,750
If I was human, that is.

889
01:16:26,875 --> 01:16:30,659
If you`re watching this,
l`m no longer here.

890
01:16:32,255 --> 01:16:35,506
I hope my demise didn`t
cause you any undue distress.

891
01:16:36,885 --> 01:16:39,211
Phillip,

892
01:16:39,305 --> 01:16:43,219
a full and complete design
of me is in this file.

893
01:16:43,351 --> 01:16:46,720
You didn`t forget it.
I never showed it to you.

894
01:16:47,980 --> 01:16:50,602
I`ve made a few changes.

895
01:16:50,733 --> 01:16:53,604
I`ve removed a few
of my flaws...

896
01:16:55,030 --> 01:16:57,521
and added a little of you.

897
01:16:59,993 --> 01:17:03,243
I hope you that
you can love my daughter...

898
01:17:03,372 --> 01:17:05,578
as much as I loved you.

899
01:17:45,374 --> 01:17:46,785
Ooh.

900
01:17:55,343 --> 01:17:58,380
Surprise, surprise.

901
01:17:58,513 --> 01:18:01,598
Professor Brainard.
Dr Reynolds.

902
01:18:01,683 --> 01:18:04,435
Good evening. Sit down.

903
01:18:07,189 --> 01:18:09,348
You look, uh--

904
01:18:09,483 --> 01:18:13,433
- Weary.
- Yes. Weary.

905
01:18:13,529 --> 01:18:15,736
You came to repay your loan?

906
01:18:15,865 --> 01:18:20,492
- No.
- I know you didn`t. I was
just having a little fun.

907
01:18:20,578 --> 01:18:22,867
I`m here to sell you
the flubber.

908
01:18:22,997 --> 01:18:25,749
You been to your house recently?

909
01:18:25,876 --> 01:18:29,624
- Yes.
- Do I really need to buy it?

910
01:18:31,298 --> 01:18:33,504
Flubber`s
a very quixotic substance.

911
01:18:33,634 --> 01:18:38,011
It`s very difficult to handle.
Have you tried to do anything with it?

912
01:18:38,138 --> 01:18:41,923
My man is working on it.
It won`t be a problem.

913
01:18:42,059 --> 01:18:45,974
Well, I could make it
a lot easier for you.

914
01:18:46,063 --> 01:18:48,555
If you give us a 30-day
extension on the loan,

915
01:18:48,691 --> 01:18:50,649
I`ll tell you everything
I know...

916
01:18:50,735 --> 01:18:53,736
and make you
a great deal of flubber.

917
01:18:53,863 --> 01:18:55,940
I`ll give you the 30 days,

918
01:18:56,074 --> 01:18:59,574
and after that
you give me two years.

919
01:18:59,703 --> 01:19:03,202
Whatever you come up with
over the next two years is mine.

920
01:19:03,332 --> 01:19:05,371
That`s not fair!

921
01:19:05,459 --> 01:19:07,997
Shop somewhere else, lady.

922
01:19:08,087 --> 01:19:11,041
Sara, Sara. I`ll do it.

923
01:19:14,385 --> 01:19:19,806
- May I see the flubber?
- Would you like to show these
good people to the library?

924
01:20:01,143 --> 01:20:04,393
You`re going to enjoy this.
Professor?

925
01:20:06,190 --> 01:20:08,942
I got you a little help.

926
01:20:10,778 --> 01:20:16,117
- The lovebirds.
- Wilson. Shame on you.

927
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:19,819
- Welcome.
- So you finally gave up teaching.

928
01:20:19,954 --> 01:20:25,032
How could I pass up the opportunity
to transform the energy industry?

929
01:20:25,168 --> 01:20:28,833
Flubber. Very interesting, Phil.

930
01:20:28,964 --> 01:20:31,122
Too bad it`s so unstable.

931
01:20:31,258 --> 01:20:35,552
I was just looking over the formula.
Dangerous mix.

932
01:20:35,679 --> 01:20:38,799
You just have to know how to
deal with it, really. It just
takes a few simple precautions--

933
01:20:38,891 --> 01:20:40,931
Hey, hey. Hang on, "Einsteen."

934
01:20:41,018 --> 01:20:43,936
- Stein.
- Whatever.

935
01:20:46,524 --> 01:20:51,945
- What`s this?
- Well, it-it`s a hand cream that
acts as a separating agent.

936
01:20:52,030 --> 01:20:54,984
- Right.
- Um--

937
01:20:57,369 --> 01:21:00,323
It`s so I can handle
the flubber.

938
01:21:00,414 --> 01:21:02,821
- It`s okay.
- Thank you.

939
01:21:02,916 --> 01:21:07,413
She needs to assist me.
Rub it on your hands.

940
01:21:14,887 --> 01:21:17,129
It`s a, uh--

941
01:21:20,310 --> 01:21:22,433
squirt gun.

942
01:21:22,562 --> 01:21:27,687
- What`s it for?
- I use that to lower
the temperature of the tank.

943
01:21:27,818 --> 01:21:29,692
Let him have it.

944
01:21:32,281 --> 01:21:37,026
No, no. Give it to him.
N-No, no. Give it to him.

945
01:21:37,161 --> 01:21:39,699
W-- Stop that
and give it to him.

946
01:21:41,082 --> 01:21:43,999
Put-Put it in his hand
and give it to him.

947
01:21:44,085 --> 01:21:48,379
No, no, no, no, no.
Give the gun to him.

948
01:21:49,507 --> 01:21:52,081
Oh.

949
01:21:52,218 --> 01:21:54,211
- Thank you.
- You`re welcome.

950
01:22:19,414 --> 01:22:22,249
You okay? lt`s me.

951
01:22:27,756 --> 01:22:30,757
There you go.

952
01:22:30,884 --> 01:22:33,043
Oh. Shh.

953
01:22:40,728 --> 01:22:43,266
Do it for Weebo.

954
01:22:43,398 --> 01:22:45,604
Look out!

955
01:22:48,319 --> 01:22:50,111
Ooh.

956
01:22:56,161 --> 01:22:58,237
Get him!

957
01:23:03,711 --> 01:23:06,581
- Oh, dear.
- Sara? Going somewhere?

958
01:23:06,672 --> 01:23:08,581
Wilson.

959
01:23:10,801 --> 01:23:12,628
Ooh.

960
01:23:18,685 --> 01:23:21,390
Left, left, left,
right, right, left.

961
01:23:26,193 --> 01:23:28,316
- Sara!
- Huh?
- Grab her.

962
01:23:28,445 --> 01:23:30,817
- What?
- Jump!

963
01:23:30,906 --> 01:23:32,899
I`m coming, Sara!

964
01:23:33,033 --> 01:23:34,991
Yo!

965
01:23:43,127 --> 01:23:45,500
Ooh!

966
01:23:50,302 --> 01:23:52,460
Hey, Lumpy. Hmm?

967
01:23:52,554 --> 01:23:55,010
- Come on.
- Let`s go, smart guy.

968
01:24:02,982 --> 01:24:06,185
- Ow.
- Phillip, look out!

969
01:24:17,330 --> 01:24:19,204
Sara!

970
01:24:21,793 --> 01:24:24,165
- Get him.
- This one`s for Weebo.

971
01:24:37,101 --> 01:24:38,975
Ooh.

972
01:24:57,664 --> 01:24:59,574
Oh, Mommy--

973
01:25:12,597 --> 01:25:15,266
Wow.

974
01:25:24,401 --> 01:25:26,892
Oh.

975
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,873
Beautiful.

976
01:25:42,754 --> 01:25:45,838
For as much as these
two people have finally...

977
01:25:45,965 --> 01:25:48,587
consented together
in holy wedlock...

978
01:25:48,677 --> 01:25:53,137
and have witnessed the same
before God and this company,

979
01:25:53,265 --> 01:25:56,598
I pronounce, believe it or not,

980
01:25:56,685 --> 01:26:00,517
that they be
husband and wife together.

981
01:26:00,648 --> 01:26:03,898
- You may now kiss the video screen.
- Oh.

982
01:26:12,285 --> 01:26:14,242
Love you, Sara.

983
01:26:15,622 --> 01:26:17,496
I love you.

984
01:26:21,878 --> 01:26:27,086
I`ll meet you at the reception. I`m
almost done. It`s gonna be remarkable.

985
01:26:27,217 --> 01:26:29,424
Phillip, please be careful.

986
01:26:29,553 --> 01:26:33,136
Don`t worry. These chemicals
are completely compatible.

987
01:26:33,224 --> 01:26:37,767
There`s no chance
that anything could go wrong!

988
01:26:53,245 --> 01:26:57,706
Hey, pal. We`re 30,000 feet
up in the air.

989
01:26:57,791 --> 01:27:01,374
There`s no monsters or bad guys
way up here, okay?

990
01:27:01,503 --> 01:27:03,876
You can look out the window.

991
01:27:21,858 --> 01:27:23,898
Mom. Mom!

992
01:27:23,986 --> 01:27:27,568
Flubber`s gone. Get back here!

993
01:27:32,828 --> 01:27:35,402
When we get to the hotel,
I don`t care what you say,

994
01:27:35,539 --> 01:27:37,746
I`m not sharing a room with him.

995
01:27:37,875 --> 01:27:40,580
Look at him. He`s gross.
He bounces all the time.

996
01:27:40,712 --> 01:27:42,918
He squeaks. He phase-shifts.

997
01:27:43,006 --> 01:27:45,129
I mean, he`s a quasi-plasmoid.

998
01:27:45,258 --> 01:27:47,500
If it`s hot in Hawaii,
I hope he melts.

999
01:27:52,432 --> 01:27:54,425
Ow
