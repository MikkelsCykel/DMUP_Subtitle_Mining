1
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,419
I knew I shouldn't
have worn three-inch heels.

2
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:56,513
I kept sinking into the grass
during the eulogy.

3
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:59,389
Manny. There you are.

4
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:01,155
How you doing, sweetie?

5
00:01:02,662 --> 00:01:04,823
There's just so much to say.

6
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:08,130
Annie looked so gorgeous...

7
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:10,966
laid out with all those flowers
around her.

8
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:13,495
It just looked like
she was taking a nap.

9
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,508
We bought that dress together.

10
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:17,635
She said she didn't have
any place to wear it.

11
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:19,736
Where's Molly?

12
00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:21,906
She's probably in her room.
I better go.

13
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:23,347
Check, see how she's doing.

14
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:25,684
Doris, I can't believe you.

15
00:01:25,718 --> 00:01:27,208
Where's my head?

16
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,743
So what's the matter?

17
00:01:28,788 --> 00:01:31,256
Everybody on a hunger strike
or something?

18
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,759
Eve, I was just having
one of yourfamous cookies.

19
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:35,761
Fabulous. They're not too sweet.

20
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:37,763
Two cups sugarfor a wedding...

21
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:39,765
one cup for a funeral...

22
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:43,257
and today I used half a cup.
It seemed right.

23
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:45,498
Easy on that strudel, Harry.

24
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:54,942
Mollinchka.

25
00:01:59,652 --> 00:02:01,552
You try that apricot Bundt cake?

26
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:04,716
The only thing I haven't eaten
is the tablecloth.

27
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:05,724
Poor kid.

28
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:07,726
Thank goodness she's so young.

29
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,661
If she's lucky,
she won't remember.

30
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:15,492
Don't tell me I lost Harry.

31
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:17,298
Mollinchka.

32
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:20,306
What are you doing, my darling?

33
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:30,778
Come here.

34
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:36,154
I'll see you, Dad.

35
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:39,584
OK. Bus is leaving.

36
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:41,253
All right. Here we go.

37
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,354
All right. OK.

38
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:46,865
Sid, give me the duck.

39
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,868
Give me the duck. I'm sorry.

40
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:50,199
I just miss Annie already.

41
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:51,362
Shirl, please, huh?

42
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:54,862
OK, OK. I love you sweetie, OK?

43
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:56,375
Good-bye, princess.

44
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:58,400
You'll give us a call?

45
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:01,907
Hon, please. Take care, old man.

46
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:02,937
You'll call?

47
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:08,943
Say good-bye
to Grandma and Grandpa.

48
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:27,797
Don't you want to wear
the matching top?

49
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:41,987
Want me to sing you
a lullaby?

50
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:53,497
What was the song
that Mommy sang to you?

51
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:56,297
How does that go?

52
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:59,669
Want to teach me a lullaby
to sing to you every night?

53
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:04,109
Here's a fun one.

54
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:08,803
Oh, the coffee
that they give you

55
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:10,406
They say it's mighty fine

56
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,077
It's goodfor cuts and bruises

57
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:13,881
And tastes like iodine

58
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,651
Oh, I don't want no more
of army life

59
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,284
Gee, Mom, I wanna go

60
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:21,554
Gee...

61
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:38,138
We're going to be fine, Molly.

62
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:40,304
Justfine, you and me.

63
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:44,282
I'm glad to see
your smilingface.

64
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:47,775
I haven't gotten lamb chop
to smile all day.

65
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,380
Salisbury steak...

66
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:51,890
for madame...

67
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:54,984
and veal parmigiana for me.

68
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:58,688
There you go.
Look, Molly.

69
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:01,829
Tater tots.
Yourfaves.

70
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:04,428
Mmm. Very good, very good.

71
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:12,845
You want to get that?
I didn't think so.

72
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,780
And a sore throat.

73
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,357
Hey, hi, Sid.

74
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:29,917
I'm not ready
to come back to work quite yet.

75
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:32,931
I have some people
coming by tomorrow...

76
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:36,696
that might stay with Molly
so I can leave.

77
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:38,704
I start at eight o'clock.

78
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:41,206
I will have had my breakfast...

79
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,902
and I assume
the child will have had hers.

80
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:47,242
At noon, a brisk walk...

81
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,376
followed by two hours
of Bible study.

82
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:54,680
Where is the child?

83
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:59,453
lfeel like Sophia Loren
in "Houseboat..."

84
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:02,723
when she meets
the widowed Cary Grant...

85
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:05,822
and selflessly gives herself
to his family.

86
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:13,260
Did you see it?

87
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:15,274
I know what it's like...

88
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:18,300
to lose someone
close to your heart.

89
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:19,777
I understand.

90
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:23,248
Winnie and I,
we both understand.

91
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:36,260
I'm so tired.

92
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:37,853
And I'm not tired?

93
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:41,894
Kids.

94
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:43,401
Oh, I love kids.

95
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:46,269
I have a real way
with children.

96
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:54,807
And no windows!

97
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:56,144
I get very nervous.

98
00:06:56,182 --> 00:07:01,210
If I put my head down
between my legs, I'll be better.

99
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,688
I realize it's your decision...

100
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:06,283
but I also sing.

101
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:09,192
Won't you come home,
Bill Bailey?

102
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:11,628
Won't you come home?

103
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:15,794
I cried the whole day long

104
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:17,302
Kids love that.

105
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:19,304
Kids love me, Mr. Singer.

106
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:21,806
I walk into a room
full of kids...

107
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:23,809
they drift to me...

108
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:26,311
like a goddamn kid magnet.

109
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:29,777
Uh, let's see.

110
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:32,410
I'm not sure where to begin.

111
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,150
Well, Mr. Jones died...

112
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:40,125
and we never had any children...

113
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,626
and believe me...

114
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:45,427
I would treat
your little Molly...

115
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,933
with all the love
and tenderness...

116
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,696
I'd have given my own.

117
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:54,405
OK, sweetpea.

118
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,738
Let's see about making you
some breakfast.

119
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:01,547
What might be good?

120
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:04,182
What's the matter?

121
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:05,946
Cat got your tongue?

122
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:13,923
Jonesy's famous pancakes
will loosen you up.

123
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:21,823
Just making sure
we got all the makings.

124
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:43,613
Oh, boy. Aren't we havingfun?

125
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:07,279
It's for after work.

126
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,410
Thanks.

127
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:14,419
She's been playing
that little ditty all day.

128
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:17,388
Maybe you could
talk to her about that.

129
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:19,789
Her mother
was teaching her that.

130
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,720
Hide-and-seek noodle casserole.

131
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:27,129
Peekaboo.

132
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:30,827
This is just the first course.

133
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:33,161
Looks fabulous.

134
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:34,672
The other courses...

135
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:36,675
they're hidden
throughout the room.

136
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:39,177
I'm just kidding.

137
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:42,645
Chicken Marengo.

138
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:45,207
That looks fabulous.

139
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,843
Doesn't it, Mol?

140
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:50,579
I bet your wife
wasn't this good a cook.

141
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:52,113
You think? Huh?

142
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:59,323
No, it is perfectly
all right, Mr. Singer.

143
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:01,833
Kids sometimes go through
a very tough time.

144
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:02,834
Why don't you just...

145
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:05,132
No, I'm sorry. Excuse me.

146
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:06,729
Just...

147
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,239
Justfinish your...

148
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:31,057
What are you doing?

149
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:33,765
I'm doing everything
a wife does.

150
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:37,132
Shouldn't I be getting
everything a wife gets?

151
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:22,210
Hello, kid.

152
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:24,307
My name's Corrina.

153
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,817
I bet you're Molly.

154
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:30,847
I hear you don't like talking
much these days...

155
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,585
but that's all right with me...

156
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:35,594
because it makes my job
a lot easier.

157
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:44,764
Nice wheels.

158
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:52,076
When would you like me to start?

159
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:54,579
Why don't you have a seat here?

160
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:57,878
I thought we would talk a bit.

161
00:11:58,517 --> 00:11:59,814
Talk. All right.

162
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:02,082
How long have you lived
in the house?

163
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:04,589
Three years.
Do you have any references...

164
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:06,056
Have you had maids before?

165
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:08,583
My wife used to take care
of everything.

166
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:09,787
So you're a beginner.

167
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:11,592
Let's get some things straight.

168
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,995
Yes, let's.

169
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:15,262
Salary does not
include supplies...

170
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:17,769
Excuse me.
Did the agency explain to you...

171
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:20,169
that this is just an interview?

172
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:25,407
Look, Mr. Singer,
what shall we discuss?

173
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:27,878
Children. I was wondering...

174
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,904
if you had any experience
with children.

175
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:32,918
You know, I met your little girl
out there.

176
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:34,579
She's got your eyes.

177
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,383
Do you have any references?

178
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:39,552
Do you have a résumé
or anything?

179
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,054
Thanks.

180
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:48,659
"Professor Louise Gordon.

181
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:50,464
"Fisk University."

182
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,971
How long were you with her?

183
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:54,734
Four years.

184
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,708
What happened then?

185
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,075
I graduated.

186
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,917
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Mr. Singer.

187
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,179
That's OK.

188
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:09,687
Well, if you had some glue...

189
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:11,656
I'm really good at gluing.

190
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,658
I could just glue it.

191
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:16,661
I mean, I could just
snap this back together.

192
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:18,663
No. I'll take care of it.

193
00:13:18,697 --> 00:13:20,028
Thanks for coming by.

194
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:23,034
Mr. Singer,
I'm having a really bad day...

195
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:26,037
and I'm sure you know
what that's like.

196
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:28,301
I really need this job.

197
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:31,207
Thanks for coming by.
I'll let you know.

198
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:18,523
Where is my music?

199
00:14:18,557 --> 00:14:21,549
Not in the refrigerator,
that's for sure.

200
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:25,086
Iforgot.
You'll have to do a marketing.

201
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:27,564
We're going to need...
We'll need, um...

202
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,467
I noticed there's a list
started there.

203
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,308
Yeah, it's my wife's writing.

204
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:38,970
I haven't wanted to...

205
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:42,071
Well, I'll just add on
from there.

206
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:45,780
You and Corrina
are going to go shopping...

207
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:49,083
for some breakfast
and pick up some other things.

208
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:56,283
The keys to my wife's car
are on the dresser.

209
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:58,193
Do you know how to drive?

210
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:00,556
I'm an old pro.

211
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:25,423
I was just testing the brakes.

212
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:27,982
It'll do your heart good
to know they're fine.

213
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,395
I made a slight booboo...

214
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,488
which I hope you won't
tell yourfather about.

215
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:34,522
But you won't
because you don't talk.

216
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:37,535
You're the short, silent type,
aren't you?

217
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:38,866
Oh, here she comes.

218
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:43,100
A hip-hap-hoppy
good morning to you.

219
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:44,609
Welcome to Terry's Diner.

220
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:46,873
So glad you came that extra mile
for breakfast with a smile.

221
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:49,005
I'll be right there!

222
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:51,516
So, what'll it be for starters?

223
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:54,451
I need a cup
of your strongest coffee.

224
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:56,477
Would you like a hot cocoa?

225
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:58,217
Pecan waffles?

226
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:02,627
What about the Slim Starter?

227
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:04,754
Ladies, I ain't got all day.

228
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:09,066
Wilma, where's your boss?

229
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:10,796
He's inside.

230
00:16:10,836 --> 00:16:13,304
Why don't you slip
into the backseat.

231
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:15,637
I got to talk to my friend here.

232
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:17,642
I know what
you're going through.

233
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:19,644
I used to do this.
Come on in.

234
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:21,373
OK. Just a minute.

235
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:24,041
She's coming over the side.

236
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,140
You in?

237
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,620
All right. You all right?

238
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,621
Molly, I understand
that you don't want to talk.

239
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,424
I know you have your reasons.

240
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:40,432
But we have to figure out
a way to communicate...

241
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:43,924
so if I ask you something
and the answer is yes...

242
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:46,494
pat your nose like that.
Then I'll know.

243
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:49,507
If the answer is no,
don't do anything.

244
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:52,510
Do you want to have
the pecan waffles...

245
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:55,342
with lots and lots of syrup
and butter?

246
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:59,941
All right.
That's good, what you're doing.

247
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:02,453
Would you rather have
the Slim Starter...

248
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:03,955
with cottage cheese...

249
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:05,957
the hard-boiled egg,
and the tomato?

250
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:09,722
Honey, if it's a choice
between those pecan waffles...

251
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:11,229
and that stupid egg...

252
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:14,323
for God sakes,
pat your little nose.

253
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:18,396
Good try, Wilma.

254
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,552
Ah! She did it! She did it!

255
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:37,821
Mr. Potato Head.

256
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:41,418
Mr. Potato Head.

257
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:44,357
Mister...

258
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,023
Potato Head...

259
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,259
Was alone in his bed.

260
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:48,766
I love it.

261
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:49,995
I love it.

262
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:52,936
Mr. Potato Head,
the untold story.

263
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:55,940
Sid, I have
a great opening here.

264
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:57,441
I tried, uh...

265
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,804
I'm with you. Come on.

266
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:04,338
I know how hard it's been.

267
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:05,850
We're in this together, OK?

268
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:07,351
I appreciate that. Thanks.

269
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:08,819
Absolutely.

270
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:12,256
Imagine how hard
things would be...

271
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,259
if the job got shaky.

272
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:16,022
What do you mean?

273
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:17,528
Did someone say something?

274
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:19,121
- Absolutely not.
- Sid, tell me.

275
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:20,631
Once. Maybe a couple times.

276
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,634
It's always said
very affectionately...

277
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:24,135
at least to me.

278
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:27,138
I say the old Manny Singer's
going to be back.

279
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:28,867
They say when?
And I say any day now.

280
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:31,239
They say great.
It'll be your job, too.

281
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:34,643
It's all very positive feedback.

282
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,114
Sunglasses

283
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:41,347
Yeah, we bought some sunglasses

284
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:44,355
'Cause sunglasses

285
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:47,916
Protect our eyes from the sun

286
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,427
You look good.

287
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,326
Sunglasses

288
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:11,541
Anybody want some more?

289
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:15,686
Anybody want any?

290
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:17,746
No, no, no. It's good.

291
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:20,690
Just a little more spice
than we're used to.

292
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:25,396
It was just
to bring out the flavor.

293
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:28,695
It's good.
It's just, you know, a little...

294
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:30,998
Spicy. Yeah.

295
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:35,603
Ya-da da da da da

296
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:37,575
You can make him funny

297
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:39,076
Or you can make him sunny

298
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:42,512
He's Mr. Potato Head

299
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:44,175
Oh, yes, it's true he's lumpy

300
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:45,843
OK, he's kind of dumpy

301
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:47,545
He's not a French fry

302
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:50,817
He's the potato to buy

303
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:53,619
Did you like it?

304
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:55,718
You think my boss
is going to like it?

305
00:19:56,929 --> 00:20:01,298
Maybe the iambic pentameter's
off just a bit.

306
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:08,630
Yes, it's true he's lumpy

307
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:10,665
OK, he's kind of dumpy

308
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:16,580
Now, you thought
that was clunky, didn't you?

309
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,151
Just knew we were in sync.

310
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:22,949
lambic pentameter.

311
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:24,546
Where do you want it?

312
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:28,826
Sorry. I think you have
the wrong address.

313
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,556
Why don't I just talk
to Mrs. Singer?

314
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,899
She's, um...

315
00:20:42,774 --> 00:20:44,935
She's in the bathtub right now.

316
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:57,203
I bet if you're on
the inside of a maraca...

317
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:59,240
that's what it would sound like.

318
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:09,560
Excuse me, but I'm ticklish.

319
00:22:11,596 --> 00:22:12,756
Stop that!

320
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:20,571
Oh, wait.

321
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:37,955
I hate to impose...

322
00:22:39,157 --> 00:22:41,625
but could you give me
a little help?

323
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,992
I can't do this last one
on my own.

324
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:56,466
Ah! You know,
the first time I saw you...

325
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:58,442
I knew you had this magic.

326
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:01,640
Here's another one.
Give me a hand.

327
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:04,404
Well done.

328
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:07,077
I think your dad's
really going to like...

329
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:09,087
this present you picked out.

330
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:12,454
We have to emphasize
that you picked it out yourself.

331
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:19,764
Hey, Molly, it's time to eat.

332
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:22,426
Come on, and bring Lois.

333
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:25,925
Would you like to be
queen for a day?

334
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:28,838
What do you listen
to this garbage for?

335
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:30,842
Why are you watching this?

336
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:32,343
Queen for a day.

337
00:23:32,377 --> 00:23:35,346
I knew a guy in my neighborhood,
wanted to be queen for a day.

338
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:37,975
You know what happened to him?

339
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:41,682
Her husband was killed
in the Air Force.

340
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,051
She has three children.

341
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,919
She'd like a trained dog
to ease her mind.

342
00:23:44,956 --> 00:23:46,423
My husband's gone, too.

343
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:48,688
That doesn't make me a queen,
does it?

344
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:51,662
Ladies and gentlemen...

345
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:53,994
we've heard
from all of our contestants.

346
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:57,635
Is it going to be Lois?

347
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:59,694
Numberfive! Queen for a day!

348
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:02,263
Yes! Yes, Lois! Queen Lois!

349
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:09,347
All I askedfor was a dog...

350
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:11,178
and look what I'm getting.

351
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:13,684
I want to thank
everyone out there...

352
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:15,447
everyone
who made this possible...

353
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:22,222
Lois made a sissy on the couch.

354
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:02,152
You know what I think, Molly?

355
00:26:05,463 --> 00:26:09,957
I think your mom's looking down
at youfrom heaven right now.

356
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:13,593
And if you look
really closely...

357
00:26:13,638 --> 00:26:16,539
I'll bet you'll see
she's waving.

358
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:37,120
I really appreciate
everything you're doing here...

359
00:26:37,162 --> 00:26:40,063
and whatever you believe in
is fine.

360
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:42,566
OK, your heaven is fine for you.

361
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:45,570
Molly's mother was an atheist
and so am I.

362
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:46,832
I don't want you telling her...

363
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:48,998
she's somewhere she isn't, OK?

364
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:51,672
Yes, Mr. Singer.

365
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:55,737
I'll just continue to tell Molly
her mother's in the bathtub.

366
00:27:04,155 --> 00:27:07,124
Did you ever undress
in front of a dog?

367
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:15,962
What's the matter, sweetie?

368
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:17,593
Can't sleep?

369
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:21,471
Did you have a bad dream?

370
00:27:23,508 --> 00:27:25,738
You OK?

371
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:29,480
How about I break out
some graham crackers...

372
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:32,483
and we'll sit
and watch the late-late show...

373
00:27:32,517 --> 00:27:35,953
till youfall asleep, OK?

374
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:37,511
Don't hit your nose.

375
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:44,359
I'll go get the stuff.

376
00:27:47,532 --> 00:27:50,592
A recent report
from the Surgeon General...

377
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:52,603
links cigarette smoking
to lung cancer.

378
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:55,606
Statistics show that one
out of every ten male smokers...

379
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:59,007
will die from lung cancer.

380
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:00,443
Meanwhile,
in Washington today...

381
00:28:00,478 --> 00:28:02,946
President Eisenhower announced
that he'll...

382
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:04,949
Here you go, Mol.

383
00:28:04,983 --> 00:28:06,951
...fact-finding tour
to South America.

384
00:28:06,985 --> 00:28:10,421
The vice president will visit
Venezuela, Argentina...

385
00:28:13,491 --> 00:28:15,982
Molly, what... what are you doing?

386
00:28:19,497 --> 00:28:20,964
Molly, look...

387
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:23,092
Cigarettes are for adults.

388
00:28:23,134 --> 00:28:26,103
I'll get you
bubblegum cigarettes tomorrow.

389
00:28:27,972 --> 00:28:29,439
Molly, stop it!

390
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:31,601
Now, what's the matter?

391
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:09,009
I really feel
like I should stay.

392
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:10,605
Well, it's your house.

393
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:13,617
I just can't be late
for this meeting. l...

394
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:15,118
Then you better go.

395
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:22,960
You know what it is?

396
00:29:22,994 --> 00:29:25,963
Mr. Potato Head's
in from Trenton.

397
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:27,464
I can't be late.

398
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:28,966
Really? The Mr. P?

399
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,967
The one and only.

400
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:32,469
You better get
your heinie going.

401
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:34,972
Yeah. I'm gone. Bye.

402
00:29:37,008 --> 00:29:38,566
All right, well...

403
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:41,670
Bye. Thanks.

404
00:30:33,698 --> 00:30:36,690
You know what I discovered
about your dad?

405
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:40,204
He likes to eat cookies in bed.

406
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:41,899
Can you get that cornerfor me?

407
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,931
Just pull it down, right there...
The white one.

408
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:46,701
Thank you.

409
00:30:46,744 --> 00:30:49,713
Malamutes or whatever
they call those things...

410
00:30:49,747 --> 00:30:51,374
they look like little humps.

411
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:02,717
This is where my mommy sleeps.

412
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:12,525
You're right.

413
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:16,236
Your mommy used to sleep here.

414
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:19,402
When's she coming back?

415
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:28,814
You know, Molly, I...

416
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:34,684
She's not coming home...

417
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:37,024
because when you die...

418
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:40,929
the angels
take you up to heaven.

419
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:46,093
Well, then I want to die, too.

420
00:31:48,806 --> 00:31:52,037
Now, darling,
you don't want to die.

421
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:54,135
It's too soon.

422
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,445
Was I bad?

423
00:31:58,116 --> 00:32:03,053
No. People don't die
because you're bad.

424
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:06,454
They die
because it's their time.

425
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:07,981
Lots of things happen...

426
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:12,258
but no, you...
You were not bad at all.

427
00:32:12,297 --> 00:32:13,889
You're wonderful.

428
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:17,493
And think of all the people
who are here now who love you.

429
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:20,504
They'd be so sad and upset
if you went.

430
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:24,030
And your daddy loves you.
He really needs you, too.

431
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:30,003
But my dad doesn't think
she's in heaven.

432
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:34,508
Well, maybe deep down
inside he does...

433
00:32:34,552 --> 00:32:38,113
and he's just so jealous
of those angels...

434
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:41,353
who get to play
with your mommy every day...

435
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:44,520
he just can't bring himself
to say so.

436
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:47,531
'Cause he's hurting,
like you're hurting.

437
00:32:47,565 --> 00:32:50,534
And you're going to hurt
for a long time.

438
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:53,036
Every day it will get
a little bit better...

439
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:56,666
but you'll always miss
your mommy, and that's OK.

440
00:32:59,577 --> 00:33:01,340
You know the other thing?

441
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:04,576
How many of the thirty-one
flavors have you tasted?

442
00:33:06,684 --> 00:33:08,914
Chocolate and vanilla.

443
00:33:08,953 --> 00:33:11,478
Well, that's my point.
That is my point.

444
00:33:11,522 --> 00:33:14,719
No one should go anywhere
until they've tried...

445
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:16,886
mint on the rocks
and cherries jubilee

446
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:19,158
and bing bang cherry.

447
00:33:19,197 --> 00:33:21,461
So much for you to do.

448
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:36,012
I'm home!

449
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:37,514
Look, Daddy...

450
00:33:37,548 --> 00:33:40,984
I made you some pig knuckles.

451
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:47,257
Ohh, that's wonderful.

452
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:49,225
I'm so happy.

453
00:34:09,013 --> 00:34:11,982
Think someone's inviting you
to dinner.

454
00:34:12,016 --> 00:34:14,849
Thank you very much,
but maybe another time.

455
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:17,354
No, I'd like you
to join us, too.

456
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:19,782
Well, l...

457
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:21,451
Here, have a seat.

458
00:34:21,492 --> 00:34:23,983
I guess I don't have
much of a choice.

459
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:36,237
Oh, here. Have one of mine.

460
00:34:36,874 --> 00:34:38,739
I'll have one with you.

461
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:44,614
So pretty.

462
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:47,880
It's Erik Satie,
a French composer.

463
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:51,355
Yes, I know. He was twenty-two
when he wrote this.

464
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:53,357
Can you imagine
being so poised...

465
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:55,359
and having such boldness
in a composition...

466
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:57,418
when you're only twenty-two?

467
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,835
Can Corrina sleep over tonight?

468
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,536
She's got to get home
to her husband.

469
00:35:10,575 --> 00:35:13,203
No, she doesn't.
Her husband's gone.

470
00:35:16,347 --> 00:35:17,405
I'll get it.

471
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:20,076
No, no, I'll get it.
You're our guest.

472
00:35:24,021 --> 00:35:27,081
What happened
to Mr. Potato Head's wife?

473
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,491
Um, oh, she's around.

474
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:31,495
As a matter of fact...

475
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:34,430
here she is.
You want to split this?

476
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:35,796
- No, thank you.
- Sure?

477
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:36,993
Go ahead.

478
00:35:38,002 --> 00:35:41,267
Is tater tot
Mr. Potato Head's son?

479
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:43,000
That's funny, Molly.

480
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,498
Well, yeah,
he's theirfirstborn.

481
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:48,512
Thank you.

482
00:35:50,047 --> 00:35:52,379
Oh, boy!

483
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:54,384
I got it. Butterfingers.

484
00:35:54,418 --> 00:35:59,048
Corrina, did your husband die
like Mommy did?

485
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:02,992
No, baby.
Though it is hard to tell...

486
00:36:03,027 --> 00:36:05,461
with old Edward B. Washington.

487
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:07,794
He said he was going out
for cigarettes...

488
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,424
and never came back...

489
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:11,867
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

490
00:36:11,903 --> 00:36:13,370
That's... that's OK.

491
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:14,871
I'm sorry. I'll get it.

492
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:17,875
No, I'll get it. You just sit.

493
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:19,376
I'll take care of it.

494
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:24,473
Thank youfor inviting me
to dinner.

495
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:25,982
Thank you very much...

496
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:29,680
but I just made enough for two,
and I have to go.

497
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:40,154
You can make him funny

498
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:41,665
You can make him sunny

499
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:44,998
His name is Mr. Potato Head

500
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:55,011
There's something
I wanted to tell you guys...

501
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:57,344
that I thought
you'd get a big kick out of.

502
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:02,943
The other day,
my seven-year-old asks...

503
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:04,682
You're going to love this...

504
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:06,212
We all love kids.

505
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,125
Uh, she asked me...

506
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:12,095
is... is tater tots
Mr. Potato Head's son?

507
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:14,529
Illegitimate.

508
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:18,101
My wife would have loved that...

509
00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:20,695
um, the way kids' minds work.

510
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:23,707
That's the kind of thing
we'd talk aboutfor hours...

511
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:24,935
laughing.

512
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:28,910
She had this great laugh.

513
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,550
Sid, I'm sorry.

514
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,711
Stop it. Stop it.

515
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:38,449
They could see
where you were going with it.

516
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:40,650
I had a small stroke,
but they were fine.

517
00:37:40,691 --> 00:37:41,988
- You did?
- Stop it.

518
00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:43,653
That's not why I'm here.

519
00:37:43,694 --> 00:37:46,561
Sunday... Shirl
and the boss' new squeeze...

520
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:47,996
are throwing a party
at his place.

521
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:49,829
I can't Sunday. I have Molly.

522
00:37:49,867 --> 00:37:52,529
She'll understand.
Get a sitter, OK?

523
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:54,197
Sunday, get a sitter.

524
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:59,242
Work, work, work.
Talk, talk, talk.

525
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,676
That's not what we're here for.

526
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:02,110
Come on, Manny.

527
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:06,411
Don't thank me.
I'm selfish. I miss you.

528
00:38:06,517 --> 00:38:11,853
Somewhere

529
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:14,119
Over

530
00:38:14,158 --> 00:38:16,490
The rainbow

531
00:38:16,527 --> 00:38:18,757
Skies

532
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:22,562
Are blue

533
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:30,466
And the

534
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:33,966
Dreams that you dare

535
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:36,479
To dream

536
00:38:36,514 --> 00:38:41,315
Really do come true

537
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:45,983
Someday I'll wish

538
00:38:46,023 --> 00:38:48,958
Upon a star

539
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:53,589
And wake up
where the clouds are far

540
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:58,500
Behind me

541
00:38:58,536 --> 00:39:02,802
Where

542
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:07,368
Troubles melt like lemon drops

543
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:12,542
Away above the chimney tops

544
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:14,949
That's where

545
00:39:14,985 --> 00:39:16,782
You will

546
00:39:16,821 --> 00:39:19,449
Find

547
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:22,254
Me, yeah

548
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:26,753
Somewhere over the rainbow

549
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:29,425
Mama, Percy threw his bologna
on the floor.

550
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:31,264
I didn't throw it, itfell.

551
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:33,736
Percy, hold your sandwich
with two hands.

552
00:39:33,771 --> 00:39:35,966
That dog gets more bologna
than we do.

553
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:37,473
At choir practice today...

554
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:40,477
Carl Johnson laughed at me
when I was singing.

555
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:43,105
Said I had a double chin,
lookedfat.

556
00:39:43,147 --> 00:39:45,138
You ain'tfat. You're beautiful.

557
00:39:45,182 --> 00:39:48,310
Go a little easy
on that potato salad.

558
00:39:49,353 --> 00:39:51,321
Wait. Hello?

559
00:39:52,857 --> 00:39:55,325
I don't know. Is Percy here?

560
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:56,326
Right here.

561
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,827
Yes? Hold on, please.

562
00:39:57,862 --> 00:39:59,830
It's for you.

563
00:39:59,864 --> 00:40:02,492
Oh, yes, my lovely.

564
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:05,263
I will twist around...

565
00:40:05,302 --> 00:40:06,769
Sit down.

566
00:40:06,804 --> 00:40:08,066
I'm on the phone.

567
00:40:08,105 --> 00:40:12,667
I know, but I want you to sit
while you're on the phone.

568
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:13,938
You talked to Charlie today?

569
00:40:13,978 --> 00:40:16,970
Yeah, ten more paid off,
laid off.

570
00:40:17,014 --> 00:40:19,141
I'll get some new shifts.

571
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:20,650
Somebody will have to
watch Percy.

572
00:40:20,684 --> 00:40:23,380
I'll call Mrs. Hopkins
and clean some fancy houses.

573
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:26,686
Hey, b-b-b-baby,
that's... that's enough.

574
00:40:26,824 --> 00:40:28,189
Eat, enjoy. It's Sunday.

575
00:40:28,225 --> 00:40:30,193
You need some fattening up.

576
00:40:30,227 --> 00:40:31,524
How about some guacamole?

577
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:33,029
I made it. It's delicious.

578
00:40:33,063 --> 00:40:34,894
Look, two of my favorite people.

579
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:36,695
Jenny Davis, Manny Singer.

580
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:38,292
Manny Singer, Jenny Davis.

581
00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:41,494
How do you do?

582
00:40:43,641 --> 00:40:45,108
Oh, there's the doorbell.

583
00:40:45,142 --> 00:40:48,043
And where's Sid, you asked?
Sidney?

584
00:40:48,078 --> 00:40:51,047
Corrina,
look who's in the neighborhood.

585
00:40:51,081 --> 00:40:52,571
Hi-ho, everybody.

586
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:54,675
- Frank, how you doing?
- Good.

587
00:40:54,718 --> 00:40:57,186
Good, good, good. Corrina...

588
00:40:57,221 --> 00:40:59,086
I was thinking...

589
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:01,489
Did you do something different
with your hair?

590
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,825
I knew it. I knew it.

591
00:41:04,862 --> 00:41:07,160
And it looks
absolutely beautiful.

592
00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:18,675
I don't think I've ever had
such good guacamole.

593
00:41:18,709 --> 00:41:22,873
Really?
Well, you haven't tasted mine.

594
00:41:27,017 --> 00:41:28,177
Babaloo

595
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:29,550
Loo loo loo

596
00:41:29,587 --> 00:41:30,918
Halftime.

597
00:41:30,955 --> 00:41:31,922
Nap time.

598
00:41:31,956 --> 00:41:34,720
No more noise from you, Percy.

599
00:41:34,758 --> 00:41:38,125
You're not my mama.
You can't tell me what to do.

600
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:43,128
Good night.

601
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:47,432
Come on up, Percy.
Ain't you lonely there?

602
00:41:47,471 --> 00:41:50,201
Yuck! I don't want to sleep
with no girls.

603
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:55,878
Now, look, this is nice, huh?

604
00:41:55,913 --> 00:41:57,039
That's cute.

605
00:41:57,081 --> 00:41:58,548
You can'tfit in that.

606
00:41:58,582 --> 00:42:00,482
I can fit in that.

607
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,986
Have you seen
what's behind you recently?

608
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,488
Let me turn
to the maternity page.

609
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:06,990
Maternity? Come on, now.

610
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:08,889
This about where you are.

611
00:42:08,926 --> 00:42:10,484
You done had three kids.

612
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:11,995
If you'd kept that nickel...

613
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:13,997
between your knees
like mama said...

614
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:15,999
you'dfit in that tiny outfit.

615
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:17,500
You talk more stuff.

616
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:18,729
I know I do.

617
00:42:18,769 --> 00:42:20,737
- Listen, Corrina...
- What?

618
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:22,238
More importantly...

619
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:25,242
why you giving Anthony
such a hard time?

620
00:42:25,276 --> 00:42:27,244
Oh, please. Anthony. Anthony.

621
00:42:27,278 --> 00:42:29,246
That's who I'm talking about.

622
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,508
Why?

623
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:34,006
Because, in the words
of Gertrude Stein, girl...

624
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:36,952
"There is no there, there."

625
00:42:36,987 --> 00:42:39,785
Oh. And you think there is
in there?

626
00:42:39,823 --> 00:42:40,949
What?

627
00:42:40,991 --> 00:42:43,459
I don't care what yourfriend
Gertrude says...

628
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:44,961
there's more with Anthony...

629
00:42:44,995 --> 00:42:47,759
than there's ever going
to be in there. So there.

630
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:53,569
Relax. She's divorced,
feels the same way you do.

631
00:42:53,604 --> 00:42:54,969
Sid, it's too soon.

632
00:42:55,005 --> 00:42:56,973
To talk to a woman?

633
00:42:57,007 --> 00:42:59,441
She needs a ride home.
Shirl and I thought...

634
00:42:59,476 --> 00:43:01,910
Is this high school?
Sid, please.

635
00:43:01,946 --> 00:43:04,312
I know how youfeel.
I'm yourfriend...

636
00:43:04,348 --> 00:43:07,511
No, you don't.
You don't know how lfeel.

637
00:43:12,523 --> 00:43:14,991
I don't know how youfeel,
all right?

638
00:43:15,025 --> 00:43:17,493
I don't know
how youfeel at all.

639
00:43:17,528 --> 00:43:20,986
But the guys at work
have an idea how youfeel.

640
00:43:21,031 --> 00:43:22,999
They've got problems
of their own.

641
00:43:23,033 --> 00:43:24,500
The bottom line is...

642
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:26,503
you need someone to talk to.

643
00:43:26,537 --> 00:43:30,029
You have me, butfrankly,
I'm not thatfond of you.

644
00:43:33,177 --> 00:43:36,146
And... and all of a sudden
out of the blue...

645
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:39,980
Molly says, "Is tater tots
Mr. Potato Head's son?"

646
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:47,354
Oh, that is what
is called adorable.

647
00:43:48,225 --> 00:43:49,487
Oh, kids, huh?

648
00:43:49,526 --> 00:43:52,495
Yeah. Just the way they work.
They're...

649
00:43:52,529 --> 00:43:55,987
Where you on the night
of April thirty-first?

650
00:43:56,033 --> 00:43:58,501
How much money do you make?

651
00:43:58,535 --> 00:44:01,936
Are you just interested
in you-know-what?

652
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:03,098
Lewis!

653
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:04,471
Oh, gosh.

654
00:44:04,508 --> 00:44:06,976
Well, as Voltaire says...

655
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:14,049
And these are my boys.

656
00:44:14,084 --> 00:44:16,985
Manny, this is my son Lewis.

657
00:44:17,021 --> 00:44:18,147
Hi, Lewis.

658
00:44:18,188 --> 00:44:19,655
And this is Howard.

659
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:20,816
Hi, Howard.

660
00:44:20,858 --> 00:44:21,984
Hi, Manny.

661
00:44:22,026 --> 00:44:23,357
How are youfellas?

662
00:44:23,394 --> 00:44:27,421
If Molly is lookingfor some
playmates, give me a call.

663
00:44:28,465 --> 00:44:31,434
Come on, let's go.
Leave the briefcase.

664
00:44:40,911 --> 00:44:43,505
Over my head

665
00:44:43,547 --> 00:44:46,380
I hear music

666
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:49,011
Over my rainbow

667
00:44:49,053 --> 00:44:52,921
Over my rainbow

668
00:44:52,956 --> 00:44:56,016
I can hear music

669
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:57,186
Music...

670
00:44:57,227 --> 00:44:58,524
Hi, Daddy.

671
00:44:58,562 --> 00:44:59,790
Catch me.

672
00:45:08,005 --> 00:45:10,496
You look just like Mommy
when you smile.

673
00:45:12,009 --> 00:45:14,477
Can we play
like we did with Mommy...

674
00:45:14,511 --> 00:45:16,172
andfly to Kalamazoo?

675
00:45:18,615 --> 00:45:20,583
Daddy, you're supposed to say...

676
00:45:20,617 --> 00:45:23,745
"Make sure you get tickets
for three, not two."

677
00:45:25,522 --> 00:45:27,490
Um, Daddy can'tfly right now.

678
00:45:27,524 --> 00:45:29,492
I've had a really hard day.

679
00:45:29,526 --> 00:45:31,517
You just get ready for sleep.

680
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:42,471
Hey, Daddy-O.

681
00:45:42,506 --> 00:45:45,498
Every cat talks to God
in his own way...

682
00:45:45,542 --> 00:45:48,340
and God understands Chinese.

683
00:45:48,378 --> 00:45:52,337
So Corrina says don't be jealous
of the angels.

684
00:45:52,382 --> 00:45:54,373
Bo, Daddy, bo.

685
00:45:56,553 --> 00:45:59,021
What did Corrina say?

686
00:45:59,056 --> 00:46:02,856
Corrina said
you're jealous of the angels.

687
00:46:05,496 --> 00:46:07,464
Why?

688
00:46:07,498 --> 00:46:11,935
Because they get to spend
all that time with Mommy.

689
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:16,770
Molly, listen to me, OK?

690
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:20,977
Heaven...

691
00:46:21,011 --> 00:46:23,639
the angels and all of that...

692
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,148
It's just something
that people make up...

693
00:46:26,183 --> 00:46:28,447
so they won'tfeel sad anymore.

694
00:46:29,553 --> 00:46:32,750
Well, what's wrong with that?

695
00:46:37,528 --> 00:46:41,396
What color eyes did Mommy have?

696
00:46:41,431 --> 00:46:43,422
I can't remember.

697
00:46:46,537 --> 00:46:48,505
Let's talk about it later.

698
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:49,665
No, now.

699
00:46:49,706 --> 00:46:50,934
It's time for bed.

700
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:52,100
What'd she smell like?

701
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:54,610
Molly, I said
we'll talk about it later.

702
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:57,113
Liar. You don't even
remember her anymore.

703
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:58,671
Of course I do.

704
00:46:58,715 --> 00:47:00,114
No, you don't.

705
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:03,017
She's disappearing.
She's almost all gone.

706
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:13,796
No! I don't want to go!

707
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:15,298
What is the matter?

708
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:16,799
There's nothing to be afraid of.

709
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:18,825
You're not going to come back.

710
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:24,474
What did you say to me?

711
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:25,975
You're not coming back.

712
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:27,977
I'll be back at three.

713
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:29,706
You promise?

714
00:47:29,746 --> 00:47:31,771
Oh, yeah, I promise.

715
00:47:31,815 --> 00:47:33,282
Now, come on.

716
00:47:33,317 --> 00:47:35,285
Maybe they won't like me.

717
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:37,480
Maybe they won't like you?

718
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:38,988
Are you kidding?

719
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:40,489
Have you looked
in the mirror today?

720
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:43,049
That's the most likable
face in America.

721
00:47:43,093 --> 00:47:45,687
We're going about this
the wrong way.

722
00:47:45,729 --> 00:47:48,197
You have to think to yourself...

723
00:47:48,232 --> 00:47:50,097
"My name is Molly Singer...

724
00:47:50,133 --> 00:47:53,466
"and there's no one in the world
better than me."

725
00:47:53,503 --> 00:47:56,961
That's what you got
to say to yourself. Try it.

726
00:47:57,007 --> 00:47:58,338
"I am Molly Singer...

727
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:01,242
"and there's nobody in the world
better than me."

728
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:05,477
Now, walk right in there...

729
00:48:05,515 --> 00:48:07,847
say that as you're walking.

730
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:09,443
Go ahead.

731
00:48:09,486 --> 00:48:11,954
I am Molly Singer...

732
00:48:11,989 --> 00:48:15,015
and there's nobody in the world
better than me.

733
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:16,525
I am Molly Singer...

734
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,461
and there's nobody in the world
better than me.

735
00:48:24,001 --> 00:48:25,798
Chin up! Up!

736
00:48:25,836 --> 00:48:27,497
You're too young to have two.

737
00:48:29,206 --> 00:48:32,073
Goodfor you.

738
00:48:32,109 --> 00:48:34,441
Pinky. Oh.

739
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:39,974
Good morning.
I'm sorry I'm late.

740
00:48:40,017 --> 00:48:41,644
Oh, I'm sorry, too.

741
00:48:41,685 --> 00:48:45,143
Wouldn't it be the day
I need my windows washed?

742
00:48:45,188 --> 00:48:46,348
All of them.

743
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:47,982
All of them?

744
00:48:48,025 --> 00:48:50,493
What do you mean, all of them?

745
00:48:50,527 --> 00:48:52,995
Miss Warner,
you want all the windows done?

746
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:56,022
This is the day
I expect them to be done.

747
00:48:56,066 --> 00:48:58,500
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I'm late.

748
00:48:58,535 --> 00:49:01,436
Crazy woman. All those windows.

749
00:49:01,471 --> 00:49:03,098
She's standing there,
watching me.

750
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:04,607
He had his lunch already.

751
00:49:04,641 --> 00:49:07,109
I'm sorry. Go on. Don't be late.

752
00:49:07,144 --> 00:49:09,442
Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire!

753
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:15,242
Don't move...

754
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:17,116
at all.

755
00:49:33,003 --> 00:49:35,563
Who's hogging the black crayon?

756
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:39,465
You used it all up.

757
00:49:39,509 --> 00:49:40,976
That's notfair.

758
00:49:41,011 --> 00:49:43,479
My dad has a big beard.

759
00:49:43,513 --> 00:49:46,311
Huh. You didn't even
do it right.

760
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:48,181
Did so.

761
00:49:49,786 --> 00:49:51,276
She drew her maid...

762
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:53,050
not her mommy.

763
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:55,456
What a dodo head.

764
00:50:01,932 --> 00:50:03,399
I'm Molly Singer...

765
00:50:03,433 --> 00:50:06,630
and there's nobody in the world
better than me.

766
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:09,332
Nobody stupider than you.

767
00:50:09,373 --> 00:50:11,204
Give me that crayon.

768
00:50:26,723 --> 00:50:29,191
I think Ed Sullivan
should run for president...

769
00:50:29,226 --> 00:50:32,195
because he knows lots
of different kinds of people...

770
00:50:32,229 --> 00:50:34,197
and could help
keep world peace...

771
00:50:34,231 --> 00:50:36,665
because he's very good
with Russian acrobats.

772
00:50:44,408 --> 00:50:45,568
Topo Gigio.

773
00:50:46,743 --> 00:50:48,370
Honey, I'm late. I'm sorry.

774
00:50:48,412 --> 00:50:50,380
They couldn't balance
the cash register.

775
00:50:50,414 --> 00:50:51,381
But I'm not done.

776
00:50:51,415 --> 00:50:52,780
I'll hear the rest later.

777
00:51:06,863 --> 00:51:08,490
Sorry I'm late.

778
00:51:08,532 --> 00:51:09,999
I'll never be late again.

779
00:51:10,033 --> 00:51:12,501
Ooh, I will never be late again.

780
00:51:12,536 --> 00:51:14,003
You don't know what happened.

781
00:51:14,037 --> 00:51:16,505
As I was coming up
the street...

782
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:19,008
a band of elephants
stopped in the street...

783
00:51:19,042 --> 00:51:21,670
and I didn't know
what to do, so...

784
00:51:21,711 --> 00:51:24,680
Are you stuck on me
with Elmer's Glue?

785
00:51:24,714 --> 00:51:28,172
I guess I'm just going
to have to carry you.

786
00:51:29,219 --> 00:51:31,710
I can't get you off.

787
00:51:32,722 --> 00:51:34,189
Come on, kid.

788
00:51:41,064 --> 00:51:43,498
What a day I've had.

789
00:51:43,533 --> 00:51:46,593
Worked my tail off andfor what?

790
00:51:46,636 --> 00:51:48,069
I'm starving.

791
00:51:55,078 --> 00:51:56,545
Where are my cigarettes?

792
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:59,242
I just put a carton in there
this week.

793
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:00,681
I don't see them.

794
00:52:00,717 --> 00:52:03,185
I can't even offer you
one of mine...

795
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:05,415
since you've smoked them, too.

796
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:07,355
What is that supposed to mean?

797
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:09,756
If you're going to smoke
my cigarettes, tell me.

798
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:11,658
Fine. If you're gonna
smoke my cigarettes...

799
00:52:11,695 --> 00:52:13,094
I'd appreciate if you told me.

800
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:14,256
All right.

801
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:15,286
Great.

802
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,008
Molly, wake up. Wake up.

803
00:52:26,042 --> 00:52:27,771
She didn't turn around.

804
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:28,937
Who?

805
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:31,777
Mommy... She was on the hill.
I saw her...

806
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:33,282
and she didn't turn around.

807
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:34,806
She just kept walking.

808
00:52:34,851 --> 00:52:36,318
Molly, if I'd been there...

809
00:52:36,353 --> 00:52:38,821
You were there.
You couldn't stop her.

810
00:52:38,855 --> 00:52:41,323
Why couldn't you?
She walked through you.

811
00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:42,825
It's yourfault she's gone.

812
00:52:42,859 --> 00:52:44,190
You never talked about her.

813
00:52:44,227 --> 00:52:45,922
You made her disappear.

814
00:52:45,962 --> 00:52:48,430
It's all yourfault she's gone.

815
00:52:48,465 --> 00:52:49,932
I hate you!

816
00:52:51,968 --> 00:52:54,528
Molly, that's enough.

817
00:52:54,571 --> 00:52:56,129
It's OK.

818
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:57,538
But I'm just so...

819
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:02,378
You're just so mad.

820
00:53:02,412 --> 00:53:05,939
You're just so mad,
and you can be mad.

821
00:53:05,982 --> 00:53:08,075
Molly, listen. I'm mad, too.

822
00:53:08,118 --> 00:53:10,279
I'm mad at Mommy for leaving us.

823
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:14,279
I want to talk to Mommy
every day, and I can't.

824
00:53:14,324 --> 00:53:18,454
I want to bring Mommy
back to you, and I can't.

825
00:53:18,495 --> 00:53:21,487
I'm mad because she didn't
say good-bye.

826
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:24,159
I'm mad about that, too, Molly.

827
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:25,361
Me, too.

828
00:53:25,402 --> 00:53:27,870
I'm mad that she made you mad.

829
00:53:27,904 --> 00:53:29,929
She should have said good-bye.

830
00:53:29,973 --> 00:53:31,440
I'm really mad at her.

831
00:53:31,474 --> 00:53:35,467
I'm just... so... mad!

832
00:53:35,512 --> 00:53:37,503
Come on, this is all right.

833
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:40,311
You can come over here
and be mad.

834
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:41,840
Come on. Be mad.

835
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:42,852
Hit it.

836
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:44,683
Yeah, hit it again.

837
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:46,188
Yeah! Hit him again, Molly.

838
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:47,247
Hit him, hit him!

839
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:48,780
Stupid head!

840
00:53:48,825 --> 00:53:50,486
- Sock him again!
- It's notfair!

841
00:53:50,527 --> 00:53:51,824
Really mad at you!

842
00:53:51,861 --> 00:53:52,987
I'm...

843
00:53:53,029 --> 00:53:54,758
mad... too!

844
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:01,435
Isn't that "Peace, Piece"?

845
00:54:02,839 --> 00:54:05,967
My dad always listens to it.

846
00:54:06,009 --> 00:54:07,476
I love it.

847
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:09,978
When you listen to Bill Evans...

848
00:54:10,013 --> 00:54:11,981
it's as though you held up...

849
00:54:12,015 --> 00:54:14,313
a really
beautifully clear crystal...

850
00:54:14,351 --> 00:54:16,876
in front of a warm light.

851
00:54:18,288 --> 00:54:20,279
That's lovely. Who wrote that?

852
00:54:21,691 --> 00:54:22,885
I did.

853
00:54:25,195 --> 00:54:26,822
You're so...

854
00:54:26,863 --> 00:54:28,660
inside the music.

855
00:54:28,698 --> 00:54:32,259
The way you phrase things,
you could write poetry.

856
00:54:32,302 --> 00:54:33,826
I do.

857
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:35,667
I did.

858
00:54:35,705 --> 00:54:38,674
You know, I'd like to write
liner notes...

859
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:40,676
in the backs of the albums.

860
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:43,178
And I want to have
my own column...

861
00:54:43,213 --> 00:54:44,680
in High Hat magazine.

862
00:54:44,714 --> 00:54:47,012
"Listenin' Up"
with Corrina Washington.

863
00:54:48,485 --> 00:54:50,453
Not that it would, you know...

864
00:54:50,487 --> 00:54:52,512
take away my joy and love...

865
00:54:52,555 --> 00:54:56,855
at scrubbing wax buildup
from linoleum floors.

866
00:54:56,893 --> 00:54:58,292
Did you ever try?

867
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:00,786
What, scrubbing wax buildup?

868
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:04,288
No, no, no.
Liner notes and poetry.

869
00:55:04,334 --> 00:55:08,293
Basically,
they just let us play the music.

870
00:55:08,338 --> 00:55:11,330
They don't let us
write about it.

871
00:55:14,511 --> 00:55:16,502
This is really bad.

872
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:21,148
I wouldn't say it's really bad.

873
00:55:21,184 --> 00:55:22,173
I would.

874
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:25,917
You've got thirty seconds
to name five songs.

875
00:55:25,955 --> 00:55:27,286
Name allfive correctly...

876
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:28,985
and you win
fifteen-thousand dollars.

877
00:55:29,025 --> 00:55:31,994
You know how much money
I've won so far?

878
00:55:32,028 --> 00:55:33,495
Millions of dollars.

879
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:36,499
I've won about a half a billion.

880
00:55:36,533 --> 00:55:38,000
Half a billion?

881
00:55:38,034 --> 00:55:39,399
I'm good at this one.

882
00:55:39,436 --> 00:55:40,767
We'll see how good you are.

883
00:55:40,804 --> 00:55:42,669
Name this tune.

884
00:55:45,041 --> 00:55:47,168
"Turkey in the Straw."

885
00:55:48,211 --> 00:55:49,337
You know the name?

886
00:55:49,379 --> 00:55:50,846
"Turkey in the Straw."

887
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,348
I think I beat you by a hair.

888
00:55:53,383 --> 00:55:54,850
Tie. One-one.

889
00:55:54,884 --> 00:55:56,010
Tie?

890
00:55:56,052 --> 00:55:58,020
Go ahead. Side with yourfather.

891
00:55:58,054 --> 00:55:59,248
Molly's the judge.

892
00:56:01,658 --> 00:56:03,125
"Sailor's Turnpike."

893
00:56:03,159 --> 00:56:04,626
"Sailor's Turnpike?"

894
00:56:04,661 --> 00:56:05,787
Two-two.

895
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:07,126
Two-two? Listen.

896
00:56:07,163 --> 00:56:08,357
"Sailor's Hornpipe."

897
00:56:09,632 --> 00:56:11,759
"Sailor's Hornpipe."

898
00:56:11,801 --> 00:56:14,292
I wonder what happened
to that guy's head.

899
00:56:14,337 --> 00:56:17,306
She smacked him for giving
the wrong answer at home.

900
00:56:34,591 --> 00:56:36,422
Why you tipping in here?

901
00:56:37,427 --> 00:56:39,554
Why you lurking on the couch?

902
00:56:39,596 --> 00:56:41,063
You awfully late.

903
00:56:41,097 --> 00:56:43,065
Little girl had a nightmare.

904
00:56:43,099 --> 00:56:44,726
They paying you overtime?

905
00:56:44,768 --> 00:56:47,396
Jevina, it wasn't
that kind of night.

906
00:56:47,437 --> 00:56:50,565
Sister child, you need
to stop kidding yourself.

907
00:56:50,607 --> 00:56:52,575
Now you know
these white folks...

908
00:56:52,609 --> 00:56:54,577
going to pretend
you're part of theirfamily...

909
00:56:54,611 --> 00:56:58,103
so they can work you
and not pay youfor your time.

910
00:56:58,148 --> 00:57:00,343
Corrina,
you're working too hard...

911
00:57:00,383 --> 00:57:03,375
to be giving it away forfree.

912
00:57:04,888 --> 00:57:08,016
Giving what away forfree,
Jevina?

913
00:57:09,893 --> 00:57:11,861
My letter come today?

914
00:57:11,895 --> 00:57:14,693
Nope, not today.

915
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:22,029
The firstfew weeks...

916
00:57:22,071 --> 00:57:25,268
are always hardfor everyone.

917
00:57:25,308 --> 00:57:27,276
Come on.

918
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:30,143
Oh, now you're not even going
to talk to me?

919
00:57:32,582 --> 00:57:34,607
It's just not that bad.

920
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:38,519
Please don't make me
go to school. I can't!

921
00:57:42,692 --> 00:57:45,183
All right, don't cry. Don't cry.

922
00:57:47,397 --> 00:57:48,421
Come on.

923
00:57:51,534 --> 00:57:53,900
Thank you, Corrina.
Say good-bye, Sophia.

924
00:58:25,802 --> 00:58:27,360
Wow.

925
00:58:27,403 --> 00:58:29,496
Well, it's just a lightfever.

926
00:58:29,539 --> 00:58:33,031
I'm sure she'll be ready
to come back tomorrow.

927
00:58:33,076 --> 00:58:35,874
If you'd just
let Mrs. Rodgers know.

928
00:58:37,747 --> 00:58:39,715
All right, then. Thank you.

929
00:58:41,417 --> 00:58:42,850
All right, you.

930
00:58:42,886 --> 00:58:45,354
You get one day, and that's it.

931
00:58:45,388 --> 00:58:46,377
Got it?

932
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:50,416
Isn't itfun
to make things shiny?

933
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:53,486
I think the thrillfor me
is gone.

934
00:58:58,635 --> 00:59:02,401
After lunch, can we go swimming
in the park?

935
00:59:02,438 --> 00:59:04,998
That's not a park.
That's their backyard...

936
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:06,508
and no, we can't...

937
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:09,512
because we have way too much
work to do.

938
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:11,207
Oh, come on. Please?

939
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:14,111
- Please?
- No.

940
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:17,176
No, we simply can't, my dear.

941
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:19,188
We simply can't.

942
00:59:28,932 --> 00:59:30,729
Every time

943
00:59:30,767 --> 00:59:33,292
It rains, it rains

944
00:59:33,336 --> 00:59:36,169
Pennies from heaven

945
00:59:36,205 --> 00:59:37,866
Bring out more.

946
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:41,365
Don't you know
each cloud contains

947
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:42,708
Feel it, girl.

948
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:46,078
Pennies from heaven?

949
00:59:46,115 --> 00:59:50,211
Oh, lfeel Esther Williams
coming on.

950
00:59:53,122 --> 00:59:54,589
May I have this dance?

951
00:59:56,526 --> 00:59:59,495
Oh, every time

952
00:59:59,529 --> 01:00:02,225
It rains, it rains

953
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:06,668
Pennies from heaven

954
01:00:06,703 --> 01:00:10,571
Don't you know
each cloud contains

955
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:11,574
Feel it, girl.

956
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:13,906
Pennies from heaven?

957
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:16,104
Very nice.

958
01:00:16,145 --> 01:00:21,310
You'llfind
yourfortune fallin'

959
01:00:21,351 --> 01:00:25,515
All over town

960
01:00:25,555 --> 01:00:27,318
Be sure

961
01:00:27,357 --> 01:00:30,155
That your umbrella

962
01:00:30,193 --> 01:00:34,289
Is upside down

963
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:36,264
Pudding. Wooding. Tooding.

964
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:39,097
The problem is pudding
doesn't rhyme with anything.

965
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:40,500
It's like knockwurst.

966
01:00:40,536 --> 01:00:42,595
Please, just rhyme with Jell-O.

967
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:44,106
I'm not helping?

968
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:45,903
No. Jell-O.

969
01:00:45,942 --> 01:00:47,068
Fellow.

970
01:00:47,110 --> 01:00:49,578
For he's a jolly good Jell-O.

971
01:00:49,612 --> 01:00:50,772
Armadillo.

972
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:52,075
Armadillo.
ArmaJell-O.

973
01:00:52,115 --> 01:00:55,016
Hunks of Jell-O
that run across the road.

974
01:00:59,522 --> 01:01:02,218
Just... Oh, very Abraham Lincoln.

975
01:01:02,258 --> 01:01:04,283
Very Abraham Lincoln.

976
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:07,091
Yes. And little eyebrows
right there.

977
01:01:08,297 --> 01:01:11,664
Will I have chi-chis
like yours someday?

978
01:01:12,435 --> 01:01:13,959
Why do you call them
chi-chis?

979
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:15,231
Who told you that?

980
01:01:15,271 --> 01:01:17,034
My daddy calls them that.

981
01:01:17,073 --> 01:01:19,166
He calls them chi-chis?

982
01:01:19,208 --> 01:01:21,676
I've heard them called
a lot of things...

983
01:01:21,711 --> 01:01:24,475
Hooters, ta-tas,
but never chi-chis.

984
01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:31,416
Anybody home?

985
01:01:31,454 --> 01:01:33,581
Oh, oh, you're in there.

986
01:01:33,623 --> 01:01:37,081
Molly, I was thinking it's such
a beautiful night out...

987
01:01:37,126 --> 01:01:39,526
why don't you and I cook dinner
for Corrina tonight?

988
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:03,878
It's my favorite song.

989
01:02:06,422 --> 01:02:07,980
Mine, too.

990
01:02:10,259 --> 01:02:12,625
You know, Billie does
a better version of it.

991
01:02:12,662 --> 01:02:14,755
No one's better than Louis.

992
01:02:18,267 --> 01:02:20,098
Nice hat.

993
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:22,669
Now listen to this.

994
01:02:22,705 --> 01:02:25,401
He writes, "Basically,
Louis needs nobody but Louis.

995
01:02:25,441 --> 01:02:27,909
"He could stand
all alone in the Sahara...

996
01:02:27,944 --> 01:02:29,707
"singing selected excerpts...

997
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:31,737
"from the Tunis
telephone directory...

998
01:02:31,781 --> 01:02:34,079
"and we suspect
that he could make it...

999
01:02:34,117 --> 01:02:35,778
"for a week
withoutfood and water."

1000
01:02:35,818 --> 01:02:37,285
Who writes this garbage?

1001
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:39,447
Somebody named Bob, obviously.

1002
01:02:39,489 --> 01:02:42,515
I don't want youfilling up
on potato chips.

1003
01:02:42,558 --> 01:02:45,152
I know you want
thatfudge sundae later.

1004
01:02:45,194 --> 01:02:46,354
Please finish your milk.

1005
01:02:46,395 --> 01:02:47,521
But I hate milk.

1006
01:02:47,563 --> 01:02:48,689
Listen to your mother.

1007
01:02:48,731 --> 01:02:51,063
Somebody once wrote
that writing about jazz...

1008
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:53,068
is like dancing
about architecture.

1009
01:02:53,102 --> 01:02:55,570
This is exactly
what we're talking about.

1010
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:58,335
I couldn't write
something like this.

1011
01:02:58,374 --> 01:03:00,467
This... Who could write like this?

1012
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:01,772
Pudding.

1013
01:03:06,749 --> 01:03:08,614
Milk makes pudding

1014
01:03:09,652 --> 01:03:11,882
Pudding is gooding

1015
01:03:11,921 --> 01:03:13,889
You sound like a doorbell.

1016
01:03:13,923 --> 01:03:15,754
Pud-ding, pud-ding

1017
01:03:16,926 --> 01:03:19,292
Oh, have you ever
had a block?

1018
01:03:20,997 --> 01:03:22,487
All my life.

1019
01:03:38,381 --> 01:03:41,817
She has a very kindface.

1020
01:03:43,953 --> 01:03:45,818
She was...

1021
01:03:45,855 --> 01:03:47,083
kind.

1022
01:03:47,123 --> 01:03:50,456
She had a real sweetness
about her.

1023
01:03:55,164 --> 01:03:57,428
Didn't have much
of a sense of humor.

1024
01:04:00,102 --> 01:04:02,093
But she loved to laugh.

1025
01:04:08,744 --> 01:04:10,302
What about Edward B?

1026
01:04:12,615 --> 01:04:13,912
Edward B.

1027
01:04:18,788 --> 01:04:21,086
He was not kind...

1028
01:04:21,123 --> 01:04:24,092
but he did have
a good sense of humor.

1029
01:04:24,126 --> 01:04:26,651
Sometimes that's not enough.

1030
01:04:28,264 --> 01:04:31,256
You know,
I could really use a...

1031
01:04:32,301 --> 01:04:34,064
Me, too.

1032
01:04:37,807 --> 01:04:40,970
You say you don't
have time to cook

1033
01:04:41,010 --> 01:04:44,104
Come over here and take a look

1034
01:04:44,146 --> 01:04:45,875
At... bum, mmm.

1035
01:04:45,915 --> 01:04:47,280
Right. Right.

1036
01:04:47,316 --> 01:04:50,285
See, and I don't have
the middle here.

1037
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:51,718
I can't get it.

1038
01:04:51,754 --> 01:04:54,222
Then I have to end it
with pudding.

1039
01:04:54,257 --> 01:04:57,283
You say you don't
have time to cook

1040
01:04:57,326 --> 01:05:00,489
Come over here and take a look

1041
01:05:00,529 --> 01:05:04,158
It's smooth, it's...

1042
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:07,465
It's smooth, it's...

1043
01:05:07,503 --> 01:05:09,994
Ffff-ast.

1044
01:05:10,039 --> 01:05:11,597
It's smooth

1045
01:05:11,641 --> 01:05:13,609
It's... cool

1046
01:05:13,643 --> 01:05:16,510
It breaks the rules

1047
01:05:16,545 --> 01:05:18,172
Really?

1048
01:05:21,884 --> 01:05:23,010
Pudding

1049
01:05:23,052 --> 01:05:25,520
See? I'm stuck on this...

1050
01:05:25,554 --> 01:05:26,919
Puddin'

1051
01:05:26,956 --> 01:05:28,583
See? It's this pudding.

1052
01:05:28,624 --> 01:05:31,184
This pudding, like the doorbell.

1053
01:05:31,227 --> 01:05:32,751
You're right. It's a doorbell.

1054
01:05:32,795 --> 01:05:34,262
You... you did it.

1055
01:05:34,297 --> 01:05:35,764
You justfixed your problem.

1056
01:05:35,798 --> 01:05:38,596
You took the "g"
off the end of pudding.

1057
01:05:38,634 --> 01:05:41,194
Who says you shouldn't
have instant puddin'?

1058
01:05:41,237 --> 01:05:42,602
It could be that simple.

1059
01:05:42,638 --> 01:05:44,435
Who says you shouldn't

1060
01:05:44,473 --> 01:05:46,771
Have instant puddin'?

1061
01:07:02,585 --> 01:07:04,519
By the light

1062
01:07:04,553 --> 01:07:06,214
By the light, by the light

1063
01:07:06,255 --> 01:07:08,382
Of the silvery moon

1064
01:07:08,424 --> 01:07:10,551
Of the moon, of the moon

1065
01:07:10,593 --> 01:07:12,720
I want to spoon

1066
01:07:12,762 --> 01:07:13,956
Good boys.

1067
01:07:13,996 --> 01:07:16,396
To my honey I'll croon

1068
01:07:16,432 --> 01:07:18,229
Love's tune

1069
01:07:18,267 --> 01:07:19,757
Sing, Molly.

1070
01:07:19,802 --> 01:07:22,737
Honeymoon

1071
01:07:22,772 --> 01:07:25,605
Keep a-shining in June

1072
01:07:25,641 --> 01:07:30,101
Your silvery beams
will bring love's dreams

1073
01:07:30,146 --> 01:07:34,947
We'll be cuddling soon

1074
01:07:34,984 --> 01:07:39,853
By the silvery moon

1075
01:07:42,091 --> 01:07:43,149
Happy birthday.

1076
01:07:45,094 --> 01:07:47,654
Now make a wish. Make a wish.

1077
01:07:47,696 --> 01:07:48,890
Big wish.

1078
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:54,229
Oh, yay!

1079
01:07:54,270 --> 01:07:55,828
Got all of them.

1080
01:07:55,871 --> 01:07:57,839
Hey, look-it, Molly.

1081
01:07:57,873 --> 01:07:59,534
Happy birthday.

1082
01:07:59,575 --> 01:08:00,974
What is that?

1083
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:03,069
- Hula-hoops.
- Hula-hoop?

1084
01:08:03,112 --> 01:08:04,909
There you go.

1085
01:08:04,947 --> 01:08:07,916
Oh, you got to get
some oomph into it.

1086
01:08:07,950 --> 01:08:10,316
I'm a hooperfrom way back.

1087
01:08:13,289 --> 01:08:15,780
Wait. I have to show her...

1088
01:08:15,825 --> 01:08:18,350
'cause it don't mean a thing
if you ain't got that swing.

1089
01:08:18,394 --> 01:08:19,588
You remember that.

1090
01:09:16,552 --> 01:09:17,985
Come, come.

1091
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:19,487
Come, Mollinchka.

1092
01:09:19,522 --> 01:09:21,046
You're the birthday girl.

1093
01:09:21,090 --> 01:09:23,752
You get to choose
wherever you want to go.

1094
01:09:23,792 --> 01:09:26,090
Can Corrina come, too?

1095
01:09:26,128 --> 01:09:28,596
Oh, no, no.
Corrina's worked a long day.

1096
01:09:28,631 --> 01:09:31,225
I'm sure she wants to go home.

1097
01:09:33,068 --> 01:09:34,330
Mollinchka...

1098
01:09:34,370 --> 01:09:37,567
pick yourfavorite place
in the whole world.

1099
01:09:43,746 --> 01:09:47,238
I don't know
if I like this very much.

1100
01:10:00,362 --> 01:10:04,162
She should have cleaned this up
before we got here.

1101
01:10:05,534 --> 01:10:07,661
That's a novel idea.

1102
01:10:09,672 --> 01:10:11,230
Oh, my.

1103
01:10:12,241 --> 01:10:14,038
Well, let's get started.

1104
01:10:15,144 --> 01:10:16,805
Well, all right.

1105
01:10:59,288 --> 01:11:01,586
We deserve a break.

1106
01:11:01,624 --> 01:11:04,650
Molly, I hope that lady
has more parties.

1107
01:11:04,693 --> 01:11:06,593
These are some leftovers.

1108
01:11:10,699 --> 01:11:12,166
Yuck! A cream one.

1109
01:11:12,201 --> 01:11:14,499
I hate cream ones.

1110
01:11:14,536 --> 01:11:18,028
Give it here, Percy.
I don't mind cream ones.

1111
01:11:28,550 --> 01:11:31,348
Yuck. Coconut. I hate coconut.

1112
01:11:31,387 --> 01:11:34,185
Give it here, Percy.
I don't mind coconut.

1113
01:11:34,223 --> 01:11:36,714
You don't mind nothin', girl.

1114
01:11:38,894 --> 01:11:39,883
Look!

1115
01:11:42,865 --> 01:11:46,028
Buckwheat...
And he's wearin' diamonds.

1116
01:11:46,068 --> 01:11:48,366
Oh, yes, indeed.
He's rich, too...

1117
01:11:48,404 --> 01:11:50,872
and makes hundreds
of thousands of dollars.

1118
01:11:53,075 --> 01:11:56,044
Molly, I know you're pretending
you can't hear me...

1119
01:11:56,078 --> 01:11:58,046
but you're going back
to school tomorrow...

1120
01:11:58,080 --> 01:11:59,741
and that's that.

1121
01:12:01,183 --> 01:12:04,152
You say you don't
have time to cook

1122
01:12:04,186 --> 01:12:06,848
Come over here and take a look

1123
01:12:06,889 --> 01:12:10,325
It's smooth, it's cool,
it breaks the rules

1124
01:12:10,359 --> 01:12:13,157
Chocolate, cherry,
sweet strawberry

1125
01:12:13,195 --> 01:12:14,856
Who says you couldn't

1126
01:12:14,897 --> 01:12:16,159
Have instant puddin'

1127
01:12:16,198 --> 01:12:19,690
From J-E-L-L-O?

1128
01:12:48,764 --> 01:12:50,823
It's OK, it's OK.

1129
01:12:53,402 --> 01:12:56,200
I'm sorry I'm late.

1130
01:12:56,238 --> 01:12:59,366
Had to stop off
and get somethingfor you.

1131
01:13:02,511 --> 01:13:06,311
Um... I had a good day at work...

1132
01:13:06,348 --> 01:13:08,646
a real good day...

1133
01:13:08,684 --> 01:13:11,983
and I have you to thank for it.

1134
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:13,851
So...

1135
01:13:26,535 --> 01:13:28,594
I'm sure you could write
better liner notes.

1136
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:32,669
I was thinking...

1137
01:13:32,708 --> 01:13:34,835
why don't I take us
all outfor dinner...

1138
01:13:34,877 --> 01:13:36,310
celebrate?

1139
01:13:40,716 --> 01:13:42,684
How was school today, Mol?

1140
01:13:42,718 --> 01:13:44,549
Hard work.

1141
01:13:44,586 --> 01:13:46,611
What did you do?

1142
01:13:46,655 --> 01:13:49,886
I won the spelling bee.

1143
01:13:49,925 --> 01:13:51,358
You did?

1144
01:13:51,393 --> 01:13:54,453
Well, what do you say
we all go on out?

1145
01:13:54,496 --> 01:13:56,691
Did you hear that?
Molly won the spelling bee.

1146
01:13:56,732 --> 01:13:58,700
- I heard that.
- What was the word?

1147
01:14:02,704 --> 01:14:04,672
Vacuum.

1148
01:14:04,706 --> 01:14:07,675
Why don't we vacuum
ourselves into the car...

1149
01:14:07,709 --> 01:14:09,609
and get some dinner
because I'm starving.

1150
01:14:09,645 --> 01:14:11,374
Vacuum. That's a hard word.

1151
01:14:11,413 --> 01:14:12,710
How do you spell it?

1152
01:14:14,316 --> 01:14:16,113
H-O-O...

1153
01:14:16,151 --> 01:14:17,584
V-E-R.

1154
01:14:19,855 --> 01:14:20,822
Hoover.

1155
01:14:20,856 --> 01:14:23,086
She's so cute.

1156
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:24,990
For Molly Singer.

1157
01:14:29,364 --> 01:14:32,822
A major romance
is headed your way, young lady.

1158
01:14:32,868 --> 01:14:35,530
No. That one's yours, Daddy.

1159
01:14:44,379 --> 01:14:46,210
An angel justflew over.

1160
01:14:46,248 --> 01:14:47,442
Where?

1161
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:50,577
you can't see him, but whenever
people get really quiet...

1162
01:14:50,619 --> 01:14:51,984
at the same time at a table...

1163
01:14:52,020 --> 01:14:54,284
it means an angel's flying over.

1164
01:14:54,323 --> 01:14:55,585
Which reminds me.

1165
01:14:55,624 --> 01:14:58,787
I think I'm going to go pay
my water bill. Excuse me.

1166
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:02,354
Hey, ma'am...

1167
01:15:02,397 --> 01:15:04,763
my wife spilled tea
all over the table.

1168
01:15:06,835 --> 01:15:08,063
Hey, what's the matter with you?

1169
01:15:08,103 --> 01:15:09,934
You don't grab somebody
like that.

1170
01:15:09,972 --> 01:15:11,735
Does she look like a waitress?

1171
01:15:11,773 --> 01:15:13,536
I don't care
whose waitress she is!

1172
01:15:13,575 --> 01:15:15,770
She's not a waitress!

1173
01:15:15,811 --> 01:15:17,836
Saw him come in with his kid.

1174
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:20,007
Look at that.
Another nigger lover.

1175
01:15:20,048 --> 01:15:21,879
Sit down and clean it yourself.

1176
01:15:21,917 --> 01:15:23,077
Check, please.

1177
01:15:23,118 --> 01:15:26,178
Here now is one of the most
outstanding vocal groups...

1178
01:15:26,221 --> 01:15:27,882
in the country today...

1179
01:15:27,923 --> 01:15:31,256
Girl, when you going to wake up
and smell the coffee?

1180
01:15:31,293 --> 01:15:34,456
Don't you have
anything better to do?

1181
01:15:34,496 --> 01:15:36,760
Lonely man. Lost his wife.

1182
01:15:36,798 --> 01:15:38,925
Left with that poor little girl.

1183
01:15:38,967 --> 01:15:41,959
Now, honey,
I seen this coming a mile away.

1184
01:15:42,004 --> 01:15:43,528
I don't need a mother.

1185
01:15:43,572 --> 01:15:47,770
What you need is that nice
tall drink of water...

1186
01:15:47,809 --> 01:15:49,936
across the street, baby.

1187
01:15:49,978 --> 01:15:51,468
What's wrong,
Professor Washington?

1188
01:15:51,513 --> 01:15:53,879
Your own kind
ain't good enough for you?

1189
01:15:56,318 --> 01:15:58,445
And I thought we said...

1190
01:15:58,487 --> 01:16:00,717
you weren't going to buy
no more albums for a while.

1191
01:16:00,756 --> 01:16:01,882
I didn't.

1192
01:16:01,924 --> 01:16:05,724
Oh! He buying you presents now?

1193
01:16:05,761 --> 01:16:07,228
You know, Corrina...

1194
01:16:07,262 --> 01:16:09,230
you may have
yourfancy education...

1195
01:16:09,264 --> 01:16:13,223
and you got these fancy dresses
that you sew and everything...

1196
01:16:13,268 --> 01:16:14,462
That bothers you, doesn't it?

1197
01:16:14,503 --> 01:16:16,903
Don't do this.

1198
01:16:17,906 --> 01:16:20,170
That still don't make you smart.

1199
01:16:20,208 --> 01:16:22,676
What you come home to, baby?

1200
01:16:22,711 --> 01:16:24,804
Alone, every night.

1201
01:16:24,846 --> 01:16:26,609
When did this come?

1202
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:40,419
Doesn't even feel
like the other ones.

1203
01:16:40,462 --> 01:16:42,930
It's skinny. Look.

1204
01:16:48,370 --> 01:16:49,837
Read it slow.

1205
01:16:49,871 --> 01:16:51,168
Slow.

1206
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:01,371
"Dear Miss Washington...

1207
01:17:01,416 --> 01:17:04,715

Whitey.

1217
01:17:45,193 --> 01:17:47,286
Do you taste like chocolate?

1218
01:17:47,329 --> 01:17:50,560
I don't know.
Do you taste like vanilla?

1219
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:24,328
This little light of mine

1220

I'm gonna let it shine

I'm gonna let it shine

I'm gonna let it shine

Let it shine.

1228
01:18:44,519 --> 01:18:46,817
Oh, everybody

1229
01:18:46,855 --> 01:18:48,618
Now go

1230
01:18:48,657 --> 01:18:51,353
I'm a nigger lover.

1231
01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:54,521
Molly! What a mean thing to say.

1232
01:18:54,563 --> 01:18:57,031
You're not
my bestfriend anymore.

1233
01:18:57,065 --> 01:18:59,329
Well, I didn't know.

1234
01:18:59,367 --> 01:19:01,267
What's so mean about it?

1235
01:19:01,303 --> 01:19:03,703
I don't know. It just is.

1236
01:19:03,739 --> 01:19:06,799
It means you think you're better
than me, you honky.

1237
01:19:06,842 --> 01:19:09,811
But you just called me a donkey.

1238
01:19:09,845 --> 01:19:11,312
Not donkey, honky...

1239
01:19:11,346 --> 01:19:13,371
you white gringo womp...

1240
01:19:13,415 --> 01:19:15,440
hymie macaroni-face!

1241
01:19:15,484 --> 01:19:17,384
Shut up. She is not.

1242
01:19:17,419 --> 01:19:18,886
She's my bestfriend.

1243
01:19:20,388 --> 01:19:22,583
I'm going to let it shine

1244
01:19:22,624 --> 01:19:24,649
Oh, Jesus

1245
01:19:24,693 --> 01:19:26,786
This little light of mine

1246
01:19:26,828 --> 01:19:29,160
I'm going to let it shine

1247
01:19:29,197 --> 01:19:32,291
Let it shine, let it shine

1248
01:19:32,334 --> 01:19:33,824
Let it shine

1249
01:19:33,869 --> 01:19:35,029
God does not like ugly.

1250
01:19:35,070 --> 01:19:37,630
You're going back to school
tomorrow, and that's it.

1251
01:19:37,672 --> 01:19:40,766
But I don't want to go back.
I want to be with you.

1252
01:19:40,809 --> 01:19:42,777
You don't want to go where?

1253
01:19:48,350 --> 01:19:50,682
Back to Jenny's.

1254
01:19:50,719 --> 01:19:52,448
We'll talk about that later.

1255
01:19:52,487 --> 01:19:54,182
You know why?

1256
01:19:54,222 --> 01:19:55,689
Because, more importantly...

1257
01:19:55,724 --> 01:19:58,420
you are looking at the winner
of the new Mr. Bromide account!

1258
01:19:59,861 --> 01:20:04,821
Yay! It absorbs twenty-seven
times its weight in excess acid!

1259
01:20:04,866 --> 01:20:07,699
It's still unofficial, but...

1260
01:20:10,505 --> 01:20:14,100
I'd like to thank the people
who got me there.

1261
01:20:15,110 --> 01:20:16,441
Mademoiselle.

1262
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:20,142
Madame.

1263
01:20:26,454 --> 01:20:27,853
Must be the press.

1264
01:20:28,890 --> 01:20:30,357
You say you don't
have time to cook

1265
01:20:30,392 --> 01:20:32,383
Come over here
and take a look

1266
01:20:32,427 --> 01:20:35,863
It's smooth, it's cool,
it breaks the rules

1267
01:20:37,399 --> 01:20:39,060
Congratulations

1268
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:41,261
Manny Singer

1269
01:20:42,404 --> 01:20:46,363
Your mother just called me
with the fabulous news.

1270
01:20:46,408 --> 01:20:48,740
And I thought
we could toast Mr. Bromide...

1271
01:20:48,777 --> 01:20:51,473
with a little bubbly.

1272
01:20:53,748 --> 01:20:55,807
Aren't you proud of your daddy?

1273
01:20:55,851 --> 01:20:57,113
Oh, I got your nose!

1274
01:20:58,587 --> 01:21:00,487
Oh, this must be your girl.

1275
01:21:00,522 --> 01:21:02,615
Uh. Yeah, Corrina Washington...

1276
01:21:02,657 --> 01:21:04,124
this is Jenny Davis.

1277
01:21:04,159 --> 01:21:06,150
How very nice to meet you.

1278
01:21:06,194 --> 01:21:08,526
I hear you're a real wonder
with children.

1279
01:21:11,266 --> 01:21:13,700
Catrina, could you get us
an ice bucket and two glasses?

1280
01:21:13,735 --> 01:21:16,329
You know, uh, I'll do that.

1281
01:21:20,876 --> 01:21:23,344
Gosh, aren't those
lovely flowers?

1282
01:21:23,378 --> 01:21:26,142
Has anybody seen my cigarettes?

1283
01:21:26,181 --> 01:21:27,546
I just got you a carton.

1284
01:21:27,582 --> 01:21:30,346
I can't help it
if you're tearing through them.

1285
01:21:30,385 --> 01:21:31,545
You know...

1286
01:21:31,586 --> 01:21:34,555
the three of you
could go for a drive...

1287
01:21:34,589 --> 01:21:36,022
and maybe pick some up.

1288
01:21:36,057 --> 01:21:40,118
Or... this is what is called
a good time to quit.

1289
01:21:42,464 --> 01:21:44,398
You're so right.

1290
01:21:47,736 --> 01:21:48,930
Good night.

1291
01:21:50,405 --> 01:21:52,532
Something sure smells good.
I'll turn off the oven.

1292
01:22:03,351 --> 01:22:05,376
Well, I've never...

1293
01:22:06,354 --> 01:22:08,322
experienced another man...

1294
01:22:08,356 --> 01:22:10,586
except Douglas, and...

1295
01:22:17,732 --> 01:22:18,721
Excuse me.

1296
01:22:31,379 --> 01:22:32,346
Operator?

1297
01:22:32,380 --> 01:22:34,348
We're having trouble
on our line.

1298
01:22:34,382 --> 01:22:36,350
Can you dial the number again?

1299
01:22:36,384 --> 01:22:37,851
No one there.

1300
01:22:37,886 --> 01:22:39,353
But l...

1301
01:22:41,389 --> 01:22:42,856
Don't answer it.

1302
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:53,868
You recognize my voice.

1303
01:22:53,902 --> 01:22:55,870
What do you think you're doing?

1304
01:22:55,904 --> 01:22:59,135
Well, l... I can't sleep.

1305
01:23:00,642 --> 01:23:02,303
Good night, Molly!

1306
01:23:02,344 --> 01:23:04,778
Maybe our voices
are keeping her up.

1307
01:23:16,758 --> 01:23:18,020
You OK?

1308
01:23:27,369 --> 01:23:28,836
Boy, I tell you...

1309
01:23:28,870 --> 01:23:30,838
Louis could stand alone...

1310
01:23:30,872 --> 01:23:32,840
in the middle of the Sahara...

1311
01:23:32,874 --> 01:23:34,341
singing selected excerpts...

1312
01:23:34,376 --> 01:23:36,674
from the Tunis
telephone directory.

1313
01:23:39,347 --> 01:23:41,338
No, Louis is cool. He's cool.

1314
01:23:41,383 --> 01:23:43,351
But Billie Holiday's version...

1315
01:23:43,385 --> 01:23:45,683
It's just a bit tastier.

1316
01:23:55,397 --> 01:23:57,865
This is all very new... for me.

1317
01:23:57,899 --> 01:23:59,867
This is all very confusing.

1318
01:23:59,901 --> 01:24:02,233
I just don'tfeel
like I'm ready to get...

1319
01:24:02,270 --> 01:24:05,000
Oh, Manny, I know. I know.

1320
01:24:06,174 --> 01:24:10,873
I know how hard it is
to let yourself love again.

1321
01:24:10,912 --> 01:24:12,470
But...

1322
01:24:20,855 --> 01:24:22,948
Would you like a cigarette?

1323
01:24:22,991 --> 01:24:24,481
No. I don't smoke.

1324
01:24:24,526 --> 01:24:25,993
Maybe you should start.

1325
01:24:26,027 --> 01:24:27,927
Maybe you should get some sleep.

1326
01:24:27,962 --> 01:24:29,452
That's a pretty frock, Molly...

1327
01:24:29,497 --> 01:24:31,488
but it's a little late
for dress-up.

1328
01:24:35,470 --> 01:24:36,630
Excuse me.

1329
01:24:42,310 --> 01:24:44,505
You know what's going on here?

1330
01:24:44,546 --> 01:24:47,071
My dad's in the living room
with Jenny.

1331
01:24:47,115 --> 01:24:49,777
I don't want to hear it.
Go to sleep.

1332
01:24:49,818 --> 01:24:51,308
I can't go to sleep...

1333
01:24:51,352 --> 01:24:54,583
if I have to go back to school.
Please?

1334
01:24:54,622 --> 01:24:57,090
All right.
I'll think about it...

1335
01:24:57,125 --> 01:25:00,788
if you promise
to go right to sleep.

1336
01:25:00,829 --> 01:25:02,592
OK. I promise.

1337
01:25:03,598 --> 01:25:05,122
I love you.

1338
01:25:11,005 --> 01:25:14,031
I love you, too, Molly, OK?
Go to sleep now.

1339
01:25:14,075 --> 01:25:16,066
I'll sing you to sleep first,
though.

1340
01:25:16,111 --> 01:25:17,305
Molly, please...

1341
01:25:17,345 --> 01:25:20,644
Hush, little lady,
don't say a word

1342
01:25:20,682 --> 01:25:24,948
Molly's going to buy you
a mockingbird

1343
01:25:24,986 --> 01:25:28,319
If that mockingbird don't sing

1344
01:25:28,356 --> 01:25:32,292
Molly's going to buy you
a diamond ring

1345
01:25:32,327 --> 01:25:34,056
If that diamond ring don't shine

1346
01:25:34,095 --> 01:25:37,064
It's been a long time since
I've been serious about it...

1347
01:25:37,098 --> 01:25:39,293
but I still play a little piano.

1348
01:25:39,334 --> 01:25:40,699
I used to sing myself.

1349
01:25:40,735 --> 01:25:41,963
No kidding?

1350
01:25:43,004 --> 01:25:44,972
Bus driver
was twenty minutes late.

1351
01:25:45,006 --> 01:25:46,303
I have to talk to you.

1352
01:25:46,341 --> 01:25:48,309
Corrina.
Corrina, we need to tal...

1353
01:25:48,343 --> 01:25:51,312
Whether you like it or not,
I employ you.

1354
01:25:51,346 --> 01:25:52,813
Oh, yes, you did.

1355
01:25:52,847 --> 01:25:55,748
I meant to tell you
I'm giving you my notice.

1356
01:25:55,783 --> 01:25:56,909
What?

1357
01:25:56,951 --> 01:25:58,543
A week in advance,
which is fair.

1358
01:25:58,586 --> 01:26:00,213
Listen, about last night...

1359
01:26:00,255 --> 01:26:05,090
This is what is called
one week's notice, Mr. Singer.

1360
01:26:05,126 --> 01:26:06,320
Listen to me, please.

1361
01:26:06,361 --> 01:26:08,329
Jenny's a friend of mine.

1362
01:26:08,363 --> 01:26:11,423
I wasn't expecting her
to come over.

1363
01:26:12,834 --> 01:26:16,497
And what I really wanted
was you to stay.

1364
01:26:20,508 --> 01:26:23,443
l... I just wanted to apologize.

1365
01:26:23,478 --> 01:26:25,343
Well, thank you.

1366
01:26:25,380 --> 01:26:27,871
But let's get
one thing straight.

1367
01:26:27,916 --> 01:26:29,042
All right.

1368
01:26:29,083 --> 01:26:30,345
This is my job.

1369
01:26:30,385 --> 01:26:32,353
I work for you. Nine to five.

1370
01:26:32,387 --> 01:26:34,582
Time and a half for overtime.

1371
01:26:34,622 --> 01:26:36,317
No more. No less.

1372
01:26:36,357 --> 01:26:37,483
Absolutely.

1373
01:26:37,525 --> 01:26:38,685
Fine.

1374
01:26:43,398 --> 01:26:45,366
I'm really running late.

1375
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:48,858
I'll be home, um, aroundfive.

1376
01:26:48,903 --> 01:26:51,337
Will you just wait a minute?

1377
01:26:52,607 --> 01:26:56,566
Turn around. You have the thing
that's all messed up.

1378
01:27:28,343 --> 01:27:29,833
I tell you, Manfred...

1379
01:27:29,877 --> 01:27:31,845
I think she's spending
too much time...

1380
01:27:31,879 --> 01:27:33,278
with this Mrs. Washington.

1381
01:27:33,314 --> 01:27:35,339
Go. Tell me I'm wrong.

1382
01:27:35,383 --> 01:27:37,613
Give a look at your baby.

1383
01:27:42,557 --> 01:27:44,787
Am I blind,
or is she becoming a sh...

1384
01:27:44,826 --> 01:27:46,350
Ma, enough.

1385
01:27:46,394 --> 01:27:48,362
Kids are impressionable,
that's all.

1386
01:27:48,396 --> 01:27:51,365
Corrina's the best thing
that could have happened to her.

1387
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:54,593
Try the light.

1388
01:27:56,537 --> 01:27:57,629
Grandma...

1389
01:27:57,672 --> 01:28:00,300
you've got water spots
on your glasses.

1390
01:28:00,341 --> 01:28:02,901
Maybe you're using
the wrong soap.

1391
01:28:04,846 --> 01:28:08,805
Since when did you become
such an expert on cleaning?

1392
01:28:08,850 --> 01:28:10,818
Ah. Which reminds me...

1393
01:28:10,852 --> 01:28:13,412
did you see
how the crystal sparkled...

1394
01:28:13,454 --> 01:28:14,921
at Jenny's house?

1395
01:28:14,956 --> 01:28:17,447
Ma, please. Don't start.

1396
01:28:17,492 --> 01:28:18,618
Please?

1397
01:28:18,660 --> 01:28:20,890
Listen, Manny,
it wouldn't be so bad...

1398
01:28:20,928 --> 01:28:22,828
for yourfather to see you...

1399
01:28:22,864 --> 01:28:25,298
with a lovely new wife
while he's still here.

1400
01:28:25,333 --> 01:28:27,563
Ma, nobody's going anywhere.

1401
01:28:28,736 --> 01:28:32,137
You'll both be around to dance
at Molly's wedding.

1402
01:28:32,173 --> 01:28:34,698
Oy, Molly's wedding.

1403
01:28:36,744 --> 01:28:38,837
Look. Ha ha.

1404
01:28:42,383 --> 01:28:44,112
Show me an "A."

1405
01:28:50,425 --> 01:28:52,393
And a C-sharp.

1406
01:29:02,337 --> 01:29:04,737
That was beautiful, Harry.

1407
01:29:07,842 --> 01:29:10,310
Before you skedaddle, maestro...

1408
01:29:10,345 --> 01:29:12,313
could you spare a moment...

1409
01:29:12,347 --> 01:29:15,214
to fix the light
in the Frigidaire?

1410
01:29:18,853 --> 01:29:20,650
Ma, the light works fine.

1411
01:29:20,688 --> 01:29:23,589
So, are we going
to talk about it or what?

1412
01:29:23,624 --> 01:29:26,024
Grandpa, can you hear me?

1413
01:29:28,329 --> 01:29:31,298
Make Daddy marry Corrina, OK?

1414
01:29:38,573 --> 01:29:41,440
I told you, she's the best thing
in the worldfor Molly.

1415
01:29:41,476 --> 01:29:42,807
Look at her. She's glowing.

1416
01:29:42,844 --> 01:29:45,836
Manny, I wasn't born today.

1417
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:48,144
It's just
a tremendous relief to...

1418
01:29:48,182 --> 01:29:51,845
You were kissing Mrs. Washington
on your steps.

1419
01:29:51,886 --> 01:29:53,046
What?

1420
01:29:53,087 --> 01:29:56,523
I got a call
from your neighbor Mrs. Murphy.

1421
01:29:56,557 --> 01:29:58,024
This is sick.

1422
01:29:58,059 --> 01:29:59,526
This is really sick.

1423
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:01,221
Don't worry about Mrs. Murphy.

1424
01:30:01,262 --> 01:30:04,129
She's a small, unhappy woman
with bigfeet.

1425
01:30:04,165 --> 01:30:05,632
But that's the world.

1426
01:30:05,666 --> 01:30:09,898
It may not be a perfect world,
but it's the world we live in.

1427
01:30:09,937 --> 01:30:12,929
Listen to what
I'm telling you, Manfred.

1428
01:30:13,641 --> 01:30:17,839
Afish and a bird
can fall in love...

1429
01:30:17,879 --> 01:30:21,371
but where will they build
their nest?

1430
01:30:22,617 --> 01:30:23,811
It's flying!

1431
01:30:23,851 --> 01:30:25,318
There it is.

1432
01:30:25,353 --> 01:30:26,945
It's flying!

1433
01:31:02,223 --> 01:31:04,919
Look, guys. Look at that.

1434
01:31:06,694 --> 01:31:08,389
Here it is.

1435
01:31:10,031 --> 01:31:11,555
Here it is, here.

1436
01:31:11,599 --> 01:31:13,294
I'll get it. I'll get it!

1437
01:31:13,334 --> 01:31:15,165
In the tree?
In the sandbox.

1438
01:31:17,004 --> 01:31:18,471
In the sandbox.

1439
01:31:21,843 --> 01:31:23,174
What the...

1440
01:31:42,029 --> 01:31:43,963
This isn't a joke.

1441
01:31:45,366 --> 01:31:49,268
You have some explaining to do,
young lady.

1442
01:31:49,303 --> 01:31:52,431
Cigarettes cost money.
They're not your toys.

1443
01:31:52,473 --> 01:31:55,067
Now why did you do a thing
like that?

1444
01:31:55,109 --> 01:32:00,570
Corrina's husband went outfor
a pack of cigarettes and died.

1445
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:08,288
What are you saying?

1446
01:32:08,322 --> 01:32:09,789
They all die.

1447
01:32:09,824 --> 01:32:12,793
That's what the TV says.

1448
01:32:12,827 --> 01:32:16,524
Even the Surgery General
says it.

1449
01:32:23,838 --> 01:32:26,864
You have my promise...

1450
01:32:26,908 --> 01:32:31,971
that I will never,
ever, ever leave you...

1451
01:32:32,013 --> 01:32:33,810
ever.

1452
01:32:33,848 --> 01:32:35,315
Promise?

1453
01:32:35,349 --> 01:32:36,680
Because Mommy says...

1454
01:32:36,717 --> 01:32:40,448
it's bad to be
a breaker of promises.

1455
01:32:40,488 --> 01:32:42,581
Yeah, she did say that.

1456
01:32:44,358 --> 01:32:46,292
You see? We remember.

1457
01:32:50,865 --> 01:32:52,332
You know what?

1458
01:32:52,366 --> 01:32:56,166
If Mommy were here right now,
she'd be smiling.

1459
01:32:57,872 --> 01:33:01,137
She had the bluest,
bluest eyes...

1460
01:33:01,175 --> 01:33:02,574
just like yours.

1461
01:33:02,610 --> 01:33:04,771
Blue like mine?

1462
01:33:04,812 --> 01:33:06,780
Mm-hmm. And you know what else?

1463
01:33:08,316 --> 01:33:11,308
Yep. She smelled
just like you do.

1464
01:33:16,190 --> 01:33:17,316
What was that?

1465
01:33:17,358 --> 01:33:18,484
What?

1466
01:33:18,526 --> 01:33:20,187
Did you hear that?

1467
01:33:21,596 --> 01:33:23,291
Think it was a plane.

1468
01:33:23,331 --> 01:33:26,300
Who wants to take a trip
to Kalamazoo?

1469
01:33:26,334 --> 01:33:28,564
Make sure you get tickets
for three, not two!

1470
01:33:28,603 --> 01:33:30,764
Come here! Let's go fly.

1471
01:33:51,359 --> 01:33:52,849
Here you go.

1472
01:34:06,841 --> 01:34:08,308
I'll have this one.

1473
01:34:11,812 --> 01:34:13,302
I want chocolate!

1474
01:34:15,316 --> 01:34:17,181
Appreciate your patience.

1475
01:34:17,218 --> 01:34:20,415
They had to special order
the fabric from France.

1476
01:34:20,454 --> 01:34:23,787
Your wife had taste.

1477
01:34:23,824 --> 01:34:25,883
Yes, she did.

1478
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:29,796
Wasn't great with dimensions,
though.

1479
01:34:29,830 --> 01:34:31,798
Well, nobody's perfect.

1480
01:34:38,339 --> 01:34:41,308
One of the last things
my wife said to me...

1481
01:34:41,342 --> 01:34:44,311
was don'tforget
to pick up some almonds...

1482
01:34:44,345 --> 01:34:46,040
on the way home.

1483
01:34:48,349 --> 01:34:51,341
She said she had a coupon
for roasted.

1484
01:34:53,854 --> 01:34:55,321
But I was in a hurry...

1485
01:34:55,356 --> 01:34:57,415
and I didn't wait
till she found it.

1486
01:35:01,295 --> 01:35:03,786
I don't think
she was angry, Manny.

1487
01:35:05,299 --> 01:35:06,994
I think she understood.

1488
01:35:10,805 --> 01:35:12,773
Now, do you want to know...

1489
01:35:12,807 --> 01:35:15,275
the last thing I said
to my husband?

1490
01:35:16,777 --> 01:35:17,937
What?

1491
01:35:19,814 --> 01:35:22,339
Slow down.

1492
01:35:28,322 --> 01:35:30,620
Slow... down.

1493
01:35:46,340 --> 01:35:48,774
You have such an amazing smile.

1494
01:35:51,846 --> 01:35:53,143
Wanna dance?

1495
01:35:53,180 --> 01:35:54,306
What?

1496
01:35:54,348 --> 01:35:56,009
You want to dance?

1497
01:35:57,852 --> 01:35:58,876
Sure.

1498
01:36:00,788 --> 01:36:02,881
Been a while for me.

1499
01:37:08,789 --> 01:37:11,257
Look at the window.

1500
01:37:11,292 --> 01:37:12,281
What?

1501
01:37:14,295 --> 01:37:16,923
Take a look at the window.

1502
01:37:25,039 --> 01:37:26,836
I have to go.

1503
01:37:45,659 --> 01:37:48,992
I beg your pardon, madam,
but I have a giftfor you.

1504
01:37:49,029 --> 01:37:51,088
Now close your eyes.

1505
01:37:53,834 --> 01:37:55,301
Here you are.

1506
01:37:55,336 --> 01:37:57,304
I made this specialfor you...

1507
01:37:57,338 --> 01:37:59,806
in honor of you going back
to school tomorrow...

1508
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:01,740
so that you have a place...

1509
01:38:01,775 --> 01:38:03,743
to put all your papers,
poems, drawings...

1510
01:38:03,777 --> 01:38:06,245
and you can show them
to your dad.

1511
01:38:06,280 --> 01:38:07,440
Here.

1512
01:38:12,920 --> 01:38:15,252
I don't think anyone else
at your school...

1513
01:38:15,289 --> 01:38:16,881
has anything like this.

1514
01:38:30,804 --> 01:38:34,262
Did you notice that was Lois
on the cover there?

1515
01:38:34,308 --> 01:38:37,300
I just wanted
to point that out to you.

1516
01:38:43,350 --> 01:38:44,977
Yes, Gregory, what is it?

1517
01:38:45,019 --> 01:38:47,283
I was just wondering
when Molly Singer...

1518
01:38:47,321 --> 01:38:49,289
would be coming back to class.

1519
01:38:49,323 --> 01:38:51,621
She'll be back
as soon as she's all better.

1520
01:38:51,659 --> 01:38:55,288
That means that she'll be here
later today?

1521
01:38:55,329 --> 01:38:57,297
What makes you say that,
Gregory?

1522
01:38:57,331 --> 01:38:58,764
She's been very sick.

1523
01:39:05,773 --> 01:39:08,264
Hello, Mrs. Rodgers.
How are you?

1524
01:39:10,778 --> 01:39:12,075
What?

1525
01:39:21,655 --> 01:39:22,986
Where's Molly?

1526
01:39:23,023 --> 01:39:24,149
She's in the room.

1527
01:39:24,191 --> 01:39:26,625
How dare you keep her
out of school and not tell me.

1528
01:39:26,660 --> 01:39:28,025
There's an explanation.

1529
01:39:28,062 --> 01:39:30,030
There is no explanation.

1530
01:39:32,499 --> 01:39:34,899
She just wasn't ready.

1531
01:39:34,935 --> 01:39:36,266
Corrina, I trusted you.

1532
01:39:36,303 --> 01:39:38,771
She was not ready to go back.

1533
01:39:38,806 --> 01:39:40,273
She was not ready.

1534
01:39:40,307 --> 01:39:42,275
Corrina, you're not her mother.

1535
01:39:42,309 --> 01:39:44,140
That's not your decision.

1536
01:39:44,178 --> 01:39:47,944
How dare you lie to me, Corrina.

1537
01:39:52,820 --> 01:39:54,287
Just stay away.

1538
01:39:54,321 --> 01:39:55,879
You're fired, Corrina.

1539
01:40:18,746 --> 01:40:20,270
Why did you lie to me?

1540
01:40:23,851 --> 01:40:25,443
Why did you lie to me?

1541
01:40:31,358 --> 01:40:32,848
What are you doing?

1542
01:40:40,167 --> 01:40:42,567
Molly, you have to talk to me.

1543
01:40:45,139 --> 01:40:46,834
Go on. What happened?

1544
01:40:49,643 --> 01:40:50,632
Jesus!

1545
01:40:55,883 --> 01:40:58,852
Mom, this isn't a good time
right now.

1546
01:40:58,886 --> 01:41:01,320
Let me call you back later.

1547
01:41:04,324 --> 01:41:05,621
What?

1548
01:41:20,174 --> 01:41:21,300
Howard, here.

1549
01:41:21,341 --> 01:41:25,437
Why don't you take this piece
of cake over to Grandma.

1550
01:41:32,352 --> 01:41:34,820
Pardon me,
but could you slow down?

1551
01:41:34,855 --> 01:41:36,322
Mrs. Singer just hired me.

1552
01:41:36,356 --> 01:41:38,085
All the ashtrays emptied,
please...

1553
01:41:38,125 --> 01:41:40,093
and another pot of hot coffee.

1554
01:41:40,127 --> 01:41:41,116
Got it.

1555
01:41:42,129 --> 01:41:44,290
How are you? Where's the coffee?

1556
01:42:10,324 --> 01:42:11,791
Come on, Lois.

1557
01:42:11,825 --> 01:42:13,918
You got to eat.

1558
01:42:30,844 --> 01:42:33,278
You know, I can stay...

1559
01:42:33,313 --> 01:42:34,780
make a little dinner.

1560
01:42:35,816 --> 01:42:37,306
Untie him right now.

1561
01:42:37,351 --> 01:42:39,319
I'll clean up a little.

1562
01:42:39,353 --> 01:42:41,821
I can put Molly to bed.

1563
01:42:41,855 --> 01:42:44,824
You need me right now.

1564
01:42:44,858 --> 01:42:46,883
That's OK. I appreciate it.

1565
01:42:47,895 --> 01:42:49,328
All right. Well...

1566
01:42:49,363 --> 01:42:51,331
what are you doing with that?

1567
01:42:51,365 --> 01:42:53,333
I was going to surprise you...

1568
01:42:53,367 --> 01:42:54,834
and get it restored.

1569
01:42:54,868 --> 01:42:57,837
I bet I can get rid
of all these cracks.

1570
01:42:57,871 --> 01:42:59,338
I like the cracks.

1571
01:42:59,373 --> 01:43:01,273
No, you don't.

1572
01:43:01,308 --> 01:43:03,276
Yeah, I do. I like them a lot.

1573
01:43:03,310 --> 01:43:04,800
You are what is called...

1574
01:43:08,749 --> 01:43:09,909
Upset.

1575
01:43:15,822 --> 01:43:18,620
Well, perhaps you need
a little time.

1576
01:43:19,826 --> 01:43:21,293
We'll, um...

1577
01:43:21,328 --> 01:43:22,818
We'll talk later.

1578
01:43:29,836 --> 01:43:32,703
All right, boys.
Come on. Let's go now.

1579
01:43:32,739 --> 01:43:35,333
Come on. Right now.

1580
01:43:42,983 --> 01:43:44,848
Thanks for everything.

1581
01:43:55,295 --> 01:43:56,819
Uh-oh. He's back.

1582
01:43:56,863 --> 01:43:58,228
Come in the house, Percy.

1583
01:43:58,265 --> 01:43:59,391
Quick!

1584
01:44:18,318 --> 01:44:20,218
I should have called.

1585
01:44:23,323 --> 01:44:25,450
My father died...

1586
01:44:29,329 --> 01:44:32,696
and... it gets you to thinking...

1587
01:44:32,733 --> 01:44:35,395
about the people
that you love...

1588
01:44:35,435 --> 01:44:37,403
the things that you've done...

1589
01:44:37,437 --> 01:44:39,803
wish you hadn't done.

1590
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:43,708
Corrina,
your supper's getting cold.

1591
01:44:50,350 --> 01:44:52,318
I'm really sorry
about yourfather.

1592
01:44:52,352 --> 01:44:54,217
I liked him a lot.

1593
01:44:56,623 --> 01:44:57,885
I'm sorry.

1594
01:44:57,924 --> 01:45:02,190
I don't want the last words
I said to you to be...

1595
01:45:02,229 --> 01:45:03,924
It's all right.

1596
01:45:33,827 --> 01:45:35,260
You know...

1597
01:45:35,295 --> 01:45:37,320
I'm not very good at this.

1598
01:45:42,336 --> 01:45:45,032
Can you please
help me out here...

1599
01:45:46,340 --> 01:45:48,331
just this once?

1600
01:45:52,846 --> 01:45:54,837
Who are you talking to?

1601
01:46:00,787 --> 01:46:02,254
What's-his-name.

1602
01:46:02,289 --> 01:46:03,756
Oh, a new friend.

1603
01:46:09,296 --> 01:46:11,491
I made this for Molly.

1604
01:46:19,806 --> 01:46:22,707
Would you like
to give it to her yourself?

1605
01:46:28,315 --> 01:46:29,612
I might.

1606
01:46:29,649 --> 01:46:30,809
Good.

1607
01:46:33,186 --> 01:46:36,155
I just want to clear up
one thing.

1608
01:46:37,324 --> 01:46:38,313
Really clear.

1609
01:46:39,826 --> 01:46:42,294
So there's no mistake.

1610
01:46:42,329 --> 01:46:43,796
I quit.

1611
01:46:49,336 --> 01:46:52,305
You'll be happy to know
that I hired somebody else.

1612
01:46:52,339 --> 01:46:53,806
I think you'll like him.

1613
01:46:53,840 --> 01:46:55,398
- Did you check their references?
- Yeah.

1614
01:46:55,442 --> 01:46:57,808
Good, because you're no picnic.

1615
01:46:57,844 --> 01:46:59,175
I know.

1616
01:47:16,296 --> 01:47:18,093
I live in this neighborhood.

1617
01:47:19,399 --> 01:47:22,266
Come inside.
Come on. Come on.

1618
01:47:22,302 --> 01:47:23,462
Come on.

1619
01:47:29,309 --> 01:47:33,302
That's the funniest thing you
ever told me in your whole life.

1620
01:47:38,485 --> 01:47:40,976
This is Manny.

1621
01:47:45,325 --> 01:47:47,486
Hello, everybody.

1622
01:47:51,131 --> 01:47:53,099
- Good to meet you.
- Pleased to meet you.

1623
01:47:57,804 --> 01:47:59,772
Percy, get your jaw
off the table.

1624
01:47:59,806 --> 01:48:01,467
Pull up an extra seat.

1625
01:48:01,508 --> 01:48:03,669
Is this Mr. Puddin' Face?

1626
01:48:04,778 --> 01:48:07,508
Yes, this is the face himself.

1627
01:48:09,382 --> 01:48:10,872
Sit there.

1628
01:48:10,917 --> 01:48:13,215
Go ahead. Sit there.

1629
01:48:19,926 --> 01:48:21,393
What's your name?

1630
01:48:22,395 --> 01:48:23,760
Percy. Thank you, Percy.

1631
01:48:23,797 --> 01:48:24,923
You're welcome.

1632
01:48:24,965 --> 01:48:28,833
You know, you can eat
all my vegetables if you want.

1633

Shine, shine, shine

1634
01:48:32,405 --> 01:48:36,865
Let it shine

1635

Grandma, that's your part.

01:48:59,933 --> 01:49:02,697
Mollinchka, enough.

1641
01:49:07,874 --> 01:49:09,865
I'll sing it with you.

1642
01:49:11,711 --> 01:49:15,477
All down the road

1643
01:49:15,515 --> 01:49:18,643
Take it, Grandma.

1644
01:49:18,685 --> 01:49:22,348
All down the road

I'm going to let it shine

1646

I'm going to let it shine

1648
01:49:35,635 --> 01:49:39,628
All down the road

1649
01:49:39,673 --> 01:49:42,870
I'm going to let it shine

1650
01:49:42,909 --> 01:49:46,743
Let it shine, shine, shine

1651
