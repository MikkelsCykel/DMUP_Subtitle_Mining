00:00:05,246 --> 00:00:06,520
Hey, I got you something.

2
00:00:06,606 --> 00:00:08,198
Oh, what is it?

3
00:00:08,286 --> 00:00:10,322
It's something
I think you don't have.

4
00:00:10,406 --> 00:00:12,044
A history
of reliable boyfriends?

5
00:00:13,646 --> 00:00:15,796
No, it's--
Well, it's only, you know...

6
00:00:15,886 --> 00:00:16,955
- Open it later on.
- OK.

7
00:00:17,046 --> 00:00:18,604
Happy birthday.

8
00:00:18,686 --> 00:00:20,039
- Thank you.
- No.

9
00:00:23,406 --> 00:00:24,441
Oh.

10
00:00:42,806 --> 00:00:44,922
- Everyone, could I have
your attention?
- Oh, my God.

11
00:00:45,006 --> 00:00:48,715
Hey. Everyone,
your attention, please.

12
00:00:48,806 --> 00:00:50,876
Everyone, hi.

13
00:00:50,966 --> 00:00:51,921
Thank you for coming.

14
00:00:52,006 --> 00:00:53,485
- Really good to see you all.
- Thank you.

15
00:00:54,886 --> 00:00:55,875
As you all know,
we're here to celebrate...

16
00:00:55,966 --> 00:00:59,561
the birthday
of one Elizabeth Olivia O'Dell.

17
00:01:01,606 --> 00:01:03,722
Happy birthday.

18
00:01:03,806 --> 00:01:07,196
As many of you know, uh,
my passion in life is running.

19
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:09,440
In fact,
in a couple of days...

20
00:01:09,526 --> 00:01:11,915
I'll be completing another
marathon, thank you very much.

21
00:01:14,926 --> 00:01:17,963
Uh, now, success in running
requires a lot...

22
00:01:18,046 --> 00:01:20,560
of the same things
as success in love--

23
00:01:20,646 --> 00:01:23,035
passion, determination...

24
00:01:23,126 --> 00:01:25,765
and something I've needed
a lot of with Libby, stamina.

25
00:01:29,246 --> 00:01:30,759
That's just inappropriate,
isn't it?

26
00:01:30,846 --> 00:01:32,120
The long-winded point
I'm trying to make...

27
00:01:32,206 --> 00:01:35,721
is that both love and running
require heart...

28
00:01:35,806 --> 00:01:37,842
and Libby has...
truly, has more heart...

29
00:01:37,926 --> 00:01:39,757
than any other person
I've ever known.

30
00:01:39,846 --> 00:01:42,406
So happy birthday, sweetie.

31
00:01:44,286 --> 00:01:45,560
Thank you all.

32
00:01:50,406 --> 00:01:52,158
Oh, trainers!

33
00:01:52,966 --> 00:01:55,560
I'm sorry. Can l, uh,
just see this for a second?

34
00:01:55,646 --> 00:01:58,206
Now, what, um...
As most of you know...

35
00:01:58,286 --> 00:02:01,278
I usually run my races alone,
but I thought...

36
00:02:02,846 --> 00:02:05,155
I was wondering
if you would consider...

37
00:02:05,246 --> 00:02:06,520
becoming my partner?

38
00:02:12,606 --> 00:02:13,641
Oh, my.

39
00:02:15,006 --> 00:02:17,804
Libby, will you marry me?

40
00:02:30,326 --> 00:02:31,918
No, no, no, no.

41
00:02:33,246 --> 00:02:34,474
OK. Yes.

42
00:02:34,566 --> 00:02:36,079
- Yes?
- Yeah.

43
00:02:50,846 --> 00:02:52,040
So beautiful.

44
00:02:53,046 --> 00:02:54,445
Just beautiful.

45
00:02:55,206 --> 00:02:56,241
Thank you.

46
00:02:57,606 --> 00:02:58,721
Thank you, everybody.

47
00:03:01,246 --> 00:03:02,281
Crazy.

48
00:03:03,286 --> 00:03:04,321
What'd I miss?

49
00:03:07,766 --> 00:03:08,801
So...

50
00:03:10,646 --> 00:03:13,001
You bloody...poison.

51
00:03:14,446 --> 00:03:17,677
All right. You can stick it
up your ass...

52
00:03:17,766 --> 00:03:20,360
you big American prick.

53
00:03:21,366 --> 00:03:23,516
# Our love has changed #

54
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:29,079
- I don't mind they've decided.
- # It's not the same #

55
00:03:31,606 --> 00:03:34,279
# And the only way to say it #

56
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:37,918
# Is say it #

57
00:03:39,406 --> 00:03:40,885
# It's better #

58
00:03:44,126 --> 00:03:45,923
# I can't concede #

59
00:03:49,886 --> 00:03:52,320
# This way I feel #

60
00:03:54,646 --> 00:03:57,240
# For all the time
we spend together #

61
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:03,797
# Forever just gets better #

62
00:04:06,406 --> 00:04:09,443
# See, what I'm trying
to say is #

63
00:04:10,966 --> 00:04:15,323
# You make things better #

64
00:04:17,766 --> 00:04:21,441
# And no matter
what the day is #

65
00:04:22,526 --> 00:04:27,077
# With you here, it's better #

66
00:04:30,526 --> 00:04:32,596
# I'll stand by you #

67
00:04:36,406 --> 00:04:39,000
# If you stand by me #

68
00:04:41,006 --> 00:04:44,362
# I think it's time
that I reveal it #

69
00:04:45,526 --> 00:04:47,562
# 'Cause I believe it #

70
00:04:48,846 --> 00:04:50,962
# It's better #

71
00:04:53,086 --> 00:04:56,362
# See, what I'm tryin'
to say is #

72
00:04:57,606 --> 00:05:02,236
# You make things better #

73
00:05:12,606 --> 00:05:13,834
Dennis!

74
00:05:16,326 --> 00:05:18,078
So what do you think
we should do, Dennis?

75
00:05:19,406 --> 00:05:22,364
Jake got really upset when
I tried to explain it to him.

76
00:05:22,446 --> 00:05:26,678
So, I just wonder whether maybe
you could talk to him today?

77
00:05:31,606 --> 00:05:32,834
You know, just--
If he heard it from you...

78
00:05:32,926 --> 00:05:35,486
that you're always gonna be
his daddy, you know?

79
00:05:35,566 --> 00:05:37,284
I take it the diet's off.

80
00:05:39,766 --> 00:05:41,563
Dennis, are you even listening?

81
00:05:41,646 --> 00:05:42,635
Dennis!

82
00:05:42,726 --> 00:05:44,239
What? You want--
You want me to tell Jake...

83
00:05:44,326 --> 00:05:46,476
what a--what a--
what a perfect guy Whit is...

84
00:05:46,566 --> 00:05:47,840
and it's all gonna be
really perfect...

85
00:05:47,926 --> 00:05:49,405
in his new perfect life?

86
00:05:49,486 --> 00:05:51,761
No.
Not necessarily in those words.

87
00:05:51,846 --> 00:05:54,235
I cannot believe
you're gonna marry this guy.

88
00:05:54,326 --> 00:05:56,396
He pulled your engagement ring
out of a shoe.

89
00:05:56,486 --> 00:05:58,283
Please, Dennis,
you're the only one...

90
00:05:58,366 --> 00:06:00,402
who can help Jake
feel OK about this.

91
00:06:00,486 --> 00:06:02,602
Listen, if you wanna marry Whit,
that's fine, OK?

92
00:06:02,686 --> 00:06:04,597
You're a big girl, and you can
make your own mistakes, OK?

93
00:06:04,686 --> 00:06:06,165
But don't come down here
while I'm eating...

94
00:06:06,246 --> 00:06:08,202
my full English breakfast
with extra breakfast...

95
00:06:08,286 --> 00:06:09,958
and expect me to make things
easier for you, OK?

96
00:06:10,046 --> 00:06:11,798
Can I please get
some ketchup here?!

97
00:06:13,846 --> 00:06:15,120
I'm not gonna run.

98
00:06:15,206 --> 00:06:16,161
What?!

99
00:06:16,246 --> 00:06:17,679
I said I'm not running.

100
00:06:22,726 --> 00:06:24,125
What do you mean,
you're not running?

101
00:06:24,206 --> 00:06:26,276
I mean, I'm not running. I'm
not running a stupid marathon.

102
00:06:27,046 --> 00:06:28,525
Why? Because Libby's
getting married again?

103
00:06:28,606 --> 00:06:29,561
What did you think?

104
00:06:29,646 --> 00:06:31,045
She-- She's not gonna find
anybody better than you?

105
00:06:31,126 --> 00:06:32,161
Well, let me be the first
to tell you.

106
00:06:32,246 --> 00:06:33,759
You know, you're
not a tough act to follow.

107
00:06:33,846 --> 00:06:35,325
Oh, what?
You think I don't know that?

108
00:06:35,406 --> 00:06:37,397
I don't care any more!

109
00:06:38,086 --> 00:06:39,644
- What about me?
- What about you?

110
00:06:39,726 --> 00:06:41,444
I've got money on this!
A lot of money!

111
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,084
That is not my problem!

112
00:06:44,246 --> 00:06:45,281
Quit it!

113
00:06:45,366 --> 00:06:46,515
I'm not the quitter.

114
00:06:52,966 --> 00:06:54,479
- Let me go!
- Ow, my ear!

115
00:06:54,566 --> 00:06:55,840
- Let go!
- Ow!

116
00:07:06,126 --> 00:07:07,161
Oh, OK! Oh, all right!

117
00:07:07,246 --> 00:07:10,636
Oh, enough!
Just-- Just stop for a minute!

118
00:07:20,326 --> 00:07:22,123
# Every day,
I love you less and less #

119
00:07:23,366 --> 00:07:25,800
# I've got to get this feeling
off my chest #

120
00:07:25,886 --> 00:07:28,161
# The doctor says
all I need's pills and rest #

121
00:07:28,606 --> 00:07:30,597
# Since every day,
I love you less and less #

122
00:07:30,686 --> 00:07:32,278
# Unless, unless #

123
00:07:32,366 --> 00:07:33,560
- # I know, I feel it #
- Are you gonna run?

124
00:07:33,646 --> 00:07:34,601
# In my bones #
- No!

125
00:07:34,686 --> 00:07:35,880
# I'm sick, I'm tired #

126
00:07:35,966 --> 00:07:37,115
# Of staying in control #

127
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:40,357
- # Oh, yes, I feel
I race upon a wheel #
- Oh, God!

128
00:07:40,446 --> 00:07:42,960
- OK, OK, OK, OK.
- You'll run?

129
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:44,559
# Oh, yes, I'm stressed #

130
00:07:44,646 --> 00:07:45,965
# I'm sorry I digressed #

131
00:07:46,046 --> 00:07:48,685
# lmpressed,
you're dressed to SOS #

132
00:07:48,766 --> 00:07:50,643
# Oh-oh #

133
00:07:50,726 --> 00:07:53,240
- My balls!
- # And my parents love me #

134
00:07:53,326 --> 00:07:56,363
# Oh-oh #

135
00:07:56,446 --> 00:07:59,119
- # And my girlfriend loves me #
- That's it! Run away!

136
00:07:59,206 --> 00:08:00,719
That's what you always do!

137
00:08:01,686 --> 00:08:03,085
Run away!

138
00:08:04,846 --> 00:08:06,643
# Every day,
I love you less and less #

139
00:08:10,806 --> 00:08:12,319
Hey, what the--

140
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:14,764
- Hello, Dennis.
- What are you doing?

141
00:08:14,846 --> 00:08:15,801
Gordon called.

142
00:08:15,886 --> 00:08:17,842
He tells me
you're not running the marathon.

143
00:08:17,926 --> 00:08:19,325
- Yeah, but--
- But, what?

144
00:08:19,406 --> 00:08:20,680
Are you running or not?

145
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:21,721
- No, but--
- So there you go.

146
00:08:21,806 --> 00:08:22,955
- Wait--
- Sorry, Dennis.

147
00:08:23,046 --> 00:08:24,604
A bet's a bet. You're out.

148
00:08:25,246 --> 00:08:27,635
Mr Ghoshdashtidar?
Mr Ghoshdashtidar!

149
00:08:27,726 --> 00:08:29,045
- Who the hell are you?
- Oh, please, look.

150
00:08:29,126 --> 00:08:31,515
- I thought you were
a good man, Dennis.
- Yeah...

151
00:08:31,606 --> 00:08:34,757
A little screwed up here
in the head, OK.

152
00:08:34,846 --> 00:08:36,802
But Maya was right about you.
You are no good.

153
00:08:36,886 --> 00:08:38,319
- Look--
- Always running away...

154
00:08:38,406 --> 00:08:39,839
never running
in the right direction.

155
00:08:39,926 --> 00:08:40,881
Yeah, but, oh--

156
00:08:40,966 --> 00:08:43,480
I bought you
new running shoes, Dennis.

157
00:08:43,566 --> 00:08:46,000
The man said
they were the best you can buy.

158
00:08:46,086 --> 00:08:47,838
- Yes, but--
- "But, but, but!"

159
00:08:47,926 --> 00:08:50,918
Always "but"!
Always excuses with you!

160
00:08:51,006 --> 00:08:53,679
Always some reason
why it's not your fault!

161
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:57,202
I have news for you,
Dennis Doyle from downstairs.

162
00:08:57,886 --> 00:08:59,797
It's all your fault!

163
00:09:13,526 --> 00:09:14,754
- Hi.
- Hi.

164
00:09:16,246 --> 00:09:17,918
You-- You havin' a yard sale?

165
00:09:18,726 --> 00:09:20,762
No. Where's Libby?

166
00:09:20,846 --> 00:09:22,279
Uh, she's pickin' up Jake.

167
00:09:22,366 --> 00:09:25,802
I suppose, uh,
congratulations are in order.

168
00:09:25,886 --> 00:09:28,559
Oh, yeah. Well, thank you.

169
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:31,201
Best man won.

170
00:09:32,246 --> 00:09:35,044
Well, I wasn't really aware
it was a contest.

171
00:09:36,886 --> 00:09:39,161
Dennis! Dennis!
Is Jake with you?

172
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:40,201
No, why? I--

173
00:09:40,286 --> 00:09:41,514
Well, is he here, Whit?

174
00:09:41,606 --> 00:09:42,755
- I thought you were
picking him up.
- Jake!

175
00:09:42,846 --> 00:09:43,801
- Libby?
- Jake!

176
00:09:43,886 --> 00:09:44,955
Libby, what is--

177
00:09:45,046 --> 00:09:46,399
- What did you say to him?!
- l-- What are you--

178
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:47,635
I didn't say anything.
What do you mean?

179
00:09:47,726 --> 00:09:48,875
Well, he was at Emily's
and something happened.

180
00:09:48,966 --> 00:09:50,001
He just ran out.

181
00:09:50,086 --> 00:09:52,236
- What?
- He has run away, OK?

182
00:09:52,326 --> 00:09:53,679
Jake ran away!

183
00:09:58,246 --> 00:09:59,281
Jake!

184
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:01,801
Jake!

185
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:05,201
Gordon!

186
00:10:05,806 --> 00:10:06,841
Gordon!

187
00:10:08,126 --> 00:10:09,684
- Yes?
- Jake's run away.

188
00:10:09,766 --> 00:10:11,597
- What?
- He's run away!

189
00:10:11,686 --> 00:10:12,641
All right.
Well, wait a minute.

190
00:10:12,726 --> 00:10:14,478
Just calm down.
Think for a second.

191
00:10:14,566 --> 00:10:15,715
Where would he go?

192
00:10:56,046 --> 00:10:57,559
Hiya, snot-face.

193
00:11:16,406 --> 00:11:17,600
Yeah, he's fine.

194
00:11:18,606 --> 00:11:20,801
We'll be back in about
a half an hour, I guess.

195
00:11:20,886 --> 00:11:22,080
OK.

196
00:11:24,406 --> 00:11:25,634
Is she mad at me?

197
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:27,444
No, no.
She's just glad you're OK.

198
00:11:31,246 --> 00:11:32,804
Do you wanna tell me
what happened?

199
00:11:32,886 --> 00:11:35,684
Emily doesn't wanna be
my girlfriend any more.

200
00:11:35,766 --> 00:11:36,881
Why not?

201
00:11:36,966 --> 00:11:39,116
'Cause there's this other boy,
Robert...

202
00:11:39,206 --> 00:11:40,764
and he's got a ponytail...

203
00:11:40,846 --> 00:11:42,837
and she likes him now.

204
00:11:42,926 --> 00:11:44,757
What, she likes him
because he's got a ponytail?

205
00:11:44,846 --> 00:11:46,404
Uh-huh.

206
00:11:48,446 --> 00:11:49,720
Jake 'n Bake...

207
00:11:49,806 --> 00:11:51,034
as you get older,
you're gonna realize...

208
00:11:51,126 --> 00:11:53,321
there are a lot of things
that you don't like, OK?

209
00:11:53,406 --> 00:11:55,636
Things much worse than this.

210
00:11:55,726 --> 00:11:57,921
And when those things happen,
you can't just run away.

211
00:11:58,006 --> 00:11:59,837
Why not?

212
00:11:59,926 --> 00:12:02,156
Because it doesn't solve
the problem.

213
00:12:02,246 --> 00:12:03,235
You know,
when you start running...

214
00:12:03,326 --> 00:12:04,281
the problem's still there.

215
00:12:04,366 --> 00:12:06,880
You've got to stick at it,
and then figure out a way...

216
00:12:06,966 --> 00:12:09,878
to solve the problem, even if
it's really, really hard.

217
00:12:09,966 --> 00:12:11,843
Is that what you do, Dad?

218
00:12:15,446 --> 00:12:16,640
Dad?

219
00:12:19,246 --> 00:12:20,281
Dennis!

220
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:22,560
Dennis!

221
00:12:22,646 --> 00:12:23,681
Gordon!

222
00:12:26,406 --> 00:12:27,441
Gordon!

223
00:12:29,526 --> 00:12:31,118
- Found him?
- Yes.

224
00:12:31,206 --> 00:12:32,958
Good. You can't stay here.

225
00:12:33,726 --> 00:12:34,681
Gordon!

226
00:12:34,766 --> 00:12:35,721
What?!

227
00:12:35,806 --> 00:12:37,558
I'm running.

228
00:12:39,006 --> 00:12:40,325
Well, come on up then.

229
00:12:42,486 --> 00:12:44,522
Wow, these are great.
Where'd you get 'em?

230
00:12:44,606 --> 00:12:46,005
- Whit's place.
- Thanks.

231
00:12:46,086 --> 00:12:47,155
See, the trick is...

232
00:12:47,246 --> 00:12:49,521
you got to load up on carbs
the night before the race.

233
00:12:49,606 --> 00:12:50,561
I read it in Cosmo.

234
00:12:50,646 --> 00:12:51,635
How are the legs? Not too tight?

235
00:12:51,726 --> 00:12:53,159
No. No, they're fine.

236
00:12:53,246 --> 00:12:54,361
Have you got everyhing
you need?

237
00:12:54,446 --> 00:12:56,755
You know, your shoes,
your shorts, penis t-shirt?

238
00:12:56,846 --> 00:12:58,598
- Yes.
- Oh.

239
00:13:06,206 --> 00:13:07,605
I'm not really in the mood.

240
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:09,165
- It's for your nipples.
- What?

241
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:11,635
You run a 26-mile race,
a lot of friction...

242
00:13:11,726 --> 00:13:13,045
is generated from your shirt
to your nipples.

243
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:14,354
And the last thing you want
during a marathon...

244
00:13:14,446 --> 00:13:15,401
is nipple chafing.

245
00:13:15,486 --> 00:13:16,680
- Cosmo?
- Yeah.

246
00:13:16,766 --> 00:13:17,960
I'm not puttin' that
on my nipples, OK?

247
00:13:18,046 --> 00:13:19,923
And I'm not gonna eat this.
Let's just go to sleep.

248
00:13:20,006 --> 00:13:21,564
Well, at least,
let me make your bed for you.

249
00:13:24,766 --> 00:13:25,721
Anything else?

250
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:26,875
Have you got a pillow?

251
00:13:26,966 --> 00:13:29,116
- No.
- Well, then I guess I'm fine.

252
00:13:33,606 --> 00:13:35,517
Hey, what time
do you have to be up tomorrow?

253
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:38,564
Well, we should set the alarm
for about seven o'clock.

254
00:13:38,646 --> 00:13:40,238
- I don't have an alarm clock.
- Why not?

255
00:13:40,326 --> 00:13:42,157
I never need to be anywhere.

256
00:13:46,526 --> 00:13:47,845
The race starts at 9.00, OK?

257
00:13:47,926 --> 00:13:50,884
So we should leave here
no later than 8.00, OK?

258
00:13:50,966 --> 00:13:52,160
OK.

259
00:13:54,286 --> 00:13:55,401
Night.

260
00:13:55,486 --> 00:13:56,521
Love you.

261
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:04,121
A very good morning to you.

262
00:14:04,206 --> 00:14:06,003
It's a beautiful day
here in London...

263
00:14:06,086 --> 00:14:07,997
for the first
annual Nike River Run.

264
00:14:08,086 --> 00:14:10,281
We've had a very warm welcome
from the crowd...

265
00:14:10,366 --> 00:14:12,004
and we've got perfect conditions
for this race, Denise.

266
00:14:12,086 --> 00:14:13,485
We certainly have.

267
00:14:13,566 --> 00:14:15,716
26.2 miles
along the River Thames...

268
00:14:15,806 --> 00:14:17,842
10,000 runners
from all over the globe...

269
00:14:17,926 --> 00:14:19,757
and an amazing way
for many of these folks...

270
00:14:19,846 --> 00:14:22,360
to raise money for so many
worthwhile charities.

271
00:14:22,446 --> 00:14:23,674
And as we can see,
race officials...

272
00:14:23,766 --> 00:14:25,643
are already busy
at the starting line...

273
00:14:25,726 --> 00:14:28,194
with the start
less than an hour away.

274
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,958
- Taxi!
- # Keep on runnin' #

275
00:14:36,046 --> 00:14:37,365
Taxi!

276
00:14:37,446 --> 00:14:40,199
- # Keep on hidin' #
- Taxi!

277
00:14:40,286 --> 00:14:41,241
Wait!

278
00:14:41,326 --> 00:14:42,281
- Wait!
- # One fine day #

279
00:14:42,366 --> 00:14:43,560
# I'm gonna be the one #

280
00:14:43,646 --> 00:14:45,318
# To make you understand #

281
00:14:45,406 --> 00:14:46,634
- It's a wonderful course.
- # Oh, yeah #

282
00:14:46,726 --> 00:14:49,001
- They'll wind
around the Thames...
- # I'm gonna be your man #

283
00:14:49,766 --> 00:14:52,485
They'll cross over five bridges,
including Osney Bridge...

284
00:14:52,566 --> 00:14:53,965
Albert Bridge,
and the Millennium Bridge.

285
00:14:54,046 --> 00:14:55,843
OK, OK. So go at your
own pace today, all right?

286
00:14:55,926 --> 00:14:57,803
- Slow and steady.
- OK. Slow and steady.

287
00:14:59,366 --> 00:15:01,038
Yeah, they're challenging
the leaders we have here.

288
00:15:01,126 --> 00:15:03,594
One from Japan,
Hiyusha Shinuzu...

289
00:15:03,686 --> 00:15:06,154
and, of course, up there also,
is Sumi Yamata.

290
00:15:07,566 --> 00:15:08,601
Watch it!

291
00:15:09,406 --> 00:15:11,078
- ldiot!
- # Keep on runnin' #

292
00:15:12,846 --> 00:15:13,801
- # Runnin' from #
- The other way! Go back!

293
00:15:13,886 --> 00:15:15,319
- # My heart #
- No, we're not goin' back!

294
00:15:15,406 --> 00:15:17,158
Amongst the names
we should keep an eye on...

295
00:15:17,246 --> 00:15:18,315
are the men from Kenya.

296
00:15:18,406 --> 00:15:21,762
Always so strong, Wilson Deetay
and Collington Degwa...

297
00:15:21,846 --> 00:15:24,599
they always can be found
at front of the pack.

298
00:15:28,486 --> 00:15:29,441
This is as far
as I can get, mate.

299
00:15:29,526 --> 00:15:30,879
But I need to get to the start
of the race.

300
00:15:30,966 --> 00:15:33,400
Well, it's just over the bridge.
That's fifteen quid, mate.

301
00:15:33,486 --> 00:15:34,555
Have you got any money?

302
00:15:34,646 --> 00:15:36,364
Sir, we have
a slight liquidity problem.

303
00:15:36,446 --> 00:15:38,277
That is a shame.

304
00:15:40,526 --> 00:15:41,481
Uh, no. Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

305
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:43,477
Look, look. This is a 19...

306
00:15:43,566 --> 00:15:46,876
...40 Rolex 520 Perpetual
Oyster with a bubble back.

307
00:15:46,966 --> 00:15:47,921
That's not too shabby.

308
00:15:48,006 --> 00:15:48,961
Gordon,
you can't possibly give him--

309
00:15:49,046 --> 00:15:50,161
Hey, it's an investment.

310
00:15:51,406 --> 00:15:52,680
Gordon, thank you.

311
00:15:52,766 --> 00:15:53,881
I'll see you later then.

312
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:57,519
# Keep on runnin' #

313
00:15:57,606 --> 00:15:58,834
Hey, good luck!

314
00:15:58,926 --> 00:16:00,678
Now, typically,
the day would have started...

315
00:16:00,766 --> 00:16:02,836
at the crack of dawn
for most of these runners.

316
00:16:02,926 --> 00:16:04,200
They had a balanced breakfast...

317
00:16:04,286 --> 00:16:07,517
precise physical
and mental preparation.

318
00:16:07,606 --> 00:16:10,678
On a day like today,
to leave anything to chance...

319
00:16:10,766 --> 00:16:12,677
you'd either have
to be extremely naive...

320
00:16:12,766 --> 00:16:14,085
or a complete idiot.

321
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:16,475
# Everyone is talkin' about me #

322
00:16:21,806 --> 00:16:23,239
Over here. To me, to me.

323
00:16:24,726 --> 00:16:25,715
That's it. Be careful.

324
00:16:25,806 --> 00:16:26,875
That's an antique.

325
00:16:27,646 --> 00:16:29,637
- Did it start? Did it start?
- Not yet.

326
00:16:29,726 --> 00:16:30,875
- Turn it on.
- Here we go.

327
00:16:30,966 --> 00:16:32,240
What do we love
about these days...

328
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:34,476
is the sheer
mix of competitors.

329
00:16:34,566 --> 00:16:36,158
They come
in all shapes and sizes...

330
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:40,398
from the elite over there
to the--how should we put it--

331
00:16:40,486 --> 00:16:41,965
not so elite.

332
00:16:43,046 --> 00:16:44,320
That's Dennis!

333
00:16:46,446 --> 00:16:48,038
Look at that stretch.
Look at that.

334
00:16:49,566 --> 00:16:50,715
Double or nothing?

335
00:16:50,806 --> 00:16:51,761
Yeah, right.

336
00:16:51,846 --> 00:16:55,361
Just a few minutes to go now.
The warm-ups should be complete.

337
00:16:55,446 --> 00:16:58,677
It's time, if you have one,
for that pre-race ritual.

338
00:17:00,526 --> 00:17:02,721
Well, well, well.
You made it, huh?

339
00:17:02,806 --> 00:17:03,761
Yeah.

340
00:17:03,846 --> 00:17:05,359
Just wanna wish you luck
out there.

341
00:17:05,446 --> 00:17:08,006
You, too. How are your nipples?

342
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:10,481
Great.

343
00:17:20,366 --> 00:17:21,321
- More toast.
- Only a few moments...

344
00:17:21,406 --> 00:17:22,600
to go now,
and the officials are--

345
00:17:22,686 --> 00:17:24,642
Who do you want to win,
Daddy or Whit?

346
00:17:24,726 --> 00:17:27,559
- Who do you wanna win?
- Daddy, of course.

347
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:29,238
- If you're one
of the fun runners...
- What about you?

348
00:17:29,326 --> 00:17:31,556
- it's just about
completing the course.
- Eat your toast.

349
00:17:31,646 --> 00:17:33,682
And what a great turnout
we've got here today.

350
00:17:45,846 --> 00:17:47,040
Why am I always the tortoise?

351
00:17:47,126 --> 00:17:48,081
A bet's a bet.

352
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:49,121
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

353
00:17:49,206 --> 00:17:50,559
- Pardon me.
- All right.

354
00:17:52,486 --> 00:17:53,919
Well, Dennis, I gotta admit...

355
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:55,359
I didn't think
you'd make it this far.

356
00:17:56,046 --> 00:17:57,240
I mean, uh...

357
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,476
you don't exactly have
the best, uh, track record...

358
00:17:59,566 --> 00:18:00,555
now, do you?

359
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:02,523
Yeah, well that was then,
and this is now.

360
00:18:02,606 --> 00:18:03,641
No, Dennis.

361
00:18:05,846 --> 00:18:06,881
This is now.

362
00:18:12,806 --> 00:18:13,921
All right.

363
00:18:18,126 --> 00:18:19,605
Don't feel you have to keep up
with me.

364
00:18:19,686 --> 00:18:21,199
Well, don't feel
you have to keep up with me.

365
00:18:21,286 --> 00:18:23,083
Oh, yeah, that's the spirit.

366
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:24,519
And they're off, Chris.

367
00:18:24,606 --> 00:18:26,198
Yet another great marathon...

368
00:18:26,286 --> 00:18:28,004
getting under way
here in London.

369
00:18:29,206 --> 00:18:32,437
And having these great runners
go 26.2 miles...

370
00:18:32,526 --> 00:18:34,721
of crowded London streets...

371
00:18:34,806 --> 00:18:36,478
That was great, what you did
with Jake yesterday, by the way.

372
00:18:36,566 --> 00:18:37,521
Thanks.

373
00:18:37,606 --> 00:18:39,164
I know Libby
really appreciated it, too.

374
00:18:39,246 --> 00:18:40,201
Oh, I'm glad.

375
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:41,275
In fact,
she was so appreciative...

376
00:18:41,366 --> 00:18:43,038
we had a nice little jump
on the bed.

377
00:18:43,126 --> 00:18:44,559
- What?
- Have a good race.

378
00:18:55,966 --> 00:18:57,081
Isn't it enough?

379
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:58,121
What?

380
00:18:58,206 --> 00:19:00,595
You got the girl, all right?
Isn't it enough?

381
00:19:00,686 --> 00:19:01,960
I just think it's high time
you realize...

382
00:19:02,046 --> 00:19:03,559
that it's over, sir.

383
00:19:03,646 --> 00:19:05,045
Otherwise, it's gonna be
very tough for you...

384
00:19:05,126 --> 00:19:07,321
- when we move to Chicago.
- What?

385
00:19:07,406 --> 00:19:08,839
You better
slow down there, chief.

386
00:19:08,926 --> 00:19:10,154
You got a long way to go.

387
00:19:10,246 --> 00:19:13,602
- Yeah, well, so have you.
- Oh, yeah!

388
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:14,801
Yes, I like it.

389
00:19:14,886 --> 00:19:16,717
Run, fat boy, run!

390
00:19:21,046 --> 00:19:22,559
I can lose weight...

391
00:19:22,646 --> 00:19:24,477
but you'll always be
an asshole.

392
00:19:25,326 --> 00:19:26,441
Now, once again,
it's still being dominated...

393
00:19:26,526 --> 00:19:27,720
- by the Kenyans, Denise.
- Look at that.

394
00:19:27,806 --> 00:19:30,195
The runners are making their way
along the embankment.

395
00:19:30,286 --> 00:19:31,514
What a beautiful view of the...

396
00:19:38,046 --> 00:19:39,684
So, here we are
among the leaders of the moment.

397
00:19:39,766 --> 00:19:42,360
The pace is relatively relaxed
for the opening miles.

398
00:19:44,366 --> 00:19:45,435
Maybe a little too relaxed,
Chris.

399
00:19:45,526 --> 00:19:47,118
It looks like we've got
a couple of amateurs...

400
00:19:47,206 --> 00:19:48,241
coming up from the back.

401
00:19:52,366 --> 00:19:53,321
Mom!

402
00:19:53,406 --> 00:19:54,964
It looks like these two boys...

403
00:19:55,046 --> 00:19:56,877
are running a race
of their own here today.

404
00:19:56,966 --> 00:19:58,115
In fact,
they're causing quite a stir...

405
00:19:58,206 --> 00:19:59,275
among the serious runners.

406
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:00,958
Not something
you'd really expect...

407
00:20:01,046 --> 00:20:02,365
at this stage in the race.

408
00:20:02,446 --> 00:20:03,595
Oh. Sorry, sir.

409
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:05,321
There's a man down.

410
00:20:07,126 --> 00:20:08,161
Sorry.

411
00:20:09,326 --> 00:20:11,886
All eyes right now
are on these two runners.

412
00:20:11,966 --> 00:20:13,718
No, no, no, no, no.
What are you doing?

413
00:20:13,806 --> 00:20:16,081
- We hope to bring you
that information quickly.
- Slow down.

414
00:20:16,646 --> 00:20:17,601
But he looks good, doesn't he?

415
00:20:17,686 --> 00:20:18,835
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

416
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:21,042
...setting a new world record.

417
00:20:25,886 --> 00:20:26,841
What are you trying to prove?

418
00:20:26,926 --> 00:20:28,439
She doesn't
love you any more, man.

419
00:20:28,526 --> 00:20:29,675
I'm not doing this for Libby.

420
00:20:29,766 --> 00:20:30,755
Yeah, right.

421
00:20:30,846 --> 00:20:31,835
You're ridiculous, dude.

422
00:20:31,926 --> 00:20:34,235
What's the matter, Whit,
can't keep up?

423
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:44,201
Oh!

424
00:20:49,886 --> 00:20:51,001
Daddy!

425
00:20:51,086 --> 00:20:52,883
Dennis! I mean, Whit!

426
00:20:58,486 --> 00:20:59,680
It does look very serious.

427
00:20:59,766 --> 00:21:00,801
We're getting
some more information--

428
00:21:17,766 --> 00:21:19,757
Stay down! Stay down!

429
00:21:34,206 --> 00:21:35,525
Where do you think you're going?

430
00:21:35,606 --> 00:21:38,200
- I have to go help Dennis.
- Why?

431
00:21:38,286 --> 00:21:40,277
Because I am
the assistant coach.

432
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:42,961
Yes!

433
00:21:43,046 --> 00:21:45,321
He now leads
at the ten-mile mark.

434
00:21:48,526 --> 00:21:49,481
And that looks really painful.

435
00:21:49,566 --> 00:21:50,885
Looks like
this runner's race day...

436
00:21:50,966 --> 00:21:52,877
will be ending
at a Leeds hospital.

437
00:21:52,966 --> 00:21:54,240
Yeah, absolutely tragic--

438
00:21:54,326 --> 00:21:55,805
Mom, do something!

439
00:21:55,886 --> 00:21:57,319
- We certainly do.
Let's get back...
- Come on.

440
00:21:57,406 --> 00:21:58,725
to the leaders
in the female race.

441
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:08,761
Shit.

442
00:22:34,446 --> 00:22:36,164
Huh?

443
00:22:37,806 --> 00:22:40,366
Gordon, I think I speak
for everyone here...

444
00:22:40,446 --> 00:22:42,801
when I say, "Give me my money."

445
00:22:42,886 --> 00:22:44,604
Five grand, please.

446
00:22:47,086 --> 00:22:48,917
OK, here's the thing
about the money...

447
00:22:49,006 --> 00:22:50,041
and, actually,
it's kind of funny.

448
00:22:51,246 --> 00:22:52,998
Uh...I don't have it.

449
00:22:55,366 --> 00:22:56,594
Would you excuse us a moment?

450
00:23:01,526 --> 00:23:03,642
Hi. I'm looking
for a patient, Dennis Doyle.

451
00:23:03,726 --> 00:23:05,045
Are you family?

452
00:23:05,126 --> 00:23:06,639
- Yeah.
- Doyle?

453
00:23:06,726 --> 00:23:08,159
Yes, Dennis Doyle.

454
00:23:09,726 --> 00:23:10,875
Oh, I'm sorry,
we don't seem to have anyone...

455
00:23:10,966 --> 00:23:12,479
registered by that name.

456
00:23:12,566 --> 00:23:15,126
Are you sure?
He's a runner in the marathon.

457
00:23:15,206 --> 00:23:16,525
Oh, the runner. Oh, yeah.

458
00:23:16,606 --> 00:23:18,483
Well, he's just arrived.

459
00:23:18,566 --> 00:23:20,124
- Libby?
- Whit?

460
00:23:20,206 --> 00:23:21,400
How'd you know I was here?

461
00:23:21,486 --> 00:23:22,805
What are you doing here?

462
00:23:22,886 --> 00:23:24,956
Honey,
that psychopath tripped me.

463
00:23:25,046 --> 00:23:27,480
He tripped me.
I think I have ligament damage.

464
00:23:27,566 --> 00:23:29,079
Guys, can we-- Can we just--

465
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:31,396
Fellas, can we--
Look, I'm a patient, please.

466
00:23:31,486 --> 00:23:32,999
Just one-- Find me!

467
00:23:33,086 --> 00:23:34,565
Easy, easy! Ow!

468
00:23:34,646 --> 00:23:36,523
Vince, look, when I said
I didn't have the money...

469
00:23:36,606 --> 00:23:37,561
I meant
I didn't have the money here.

470
00:23:37,646 --> 00:23:39,637
- I can pay.
- Oh, you're gonna pay.

471
00:23:40,846 --> 00:23:43,758
No, wait. Look...Vincent.

472
00:23:43,846 --> 00:23:45,359
Wait-- Wait-- What?

473
00:23:45,446 --> 00:23:46,640
Wait. Wait a tick.

474
00:23:51,726 --> 00:23:53,956
Not so bloody fast, mate.

475
00:23:54,046 --> 00:23:55,274
Who the hell are you?

476
00:23:55,366 --> 00:23:56,924
Thanks a lot, Mr G!

477
00:23:57,006 --> 00:23:58,678
Your friend is a man of honour.

478
00:23:58,766 --> 00:23:59,721
What, Vincent?

479
00:23:59,806 --> 00:24:03,481
Yes, he said he's going to kick
shit out of you later instead.

480
00:24:03,566 --> 00:24:04,521
I don't understand.

481
00:24:04,606 --> 00:24:07,404
On the TV, they said
he was being brought here.

482
00:24:07,486 --> 00:24:08,839
One second.

483
00:24:08,926 --> 00:24:10,279
I could sue him.
You know that, right?

484
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:11,560
I could sue him
for everyhing he has...

485
00:24:11,646 --> 00:24:13,557
but, you know, seriously,
what am I gonna do...

486
00:24:13,646 --> 00:24:16,718
with some pizza boxes
and a Judas Priest t-shirt?

487
00:24:16,806 --> 00:24:18,398
Honey,
I'm sure it was an accident.

488
00:24:18,486 --> 00:24:20,044
Well, you weren't there, OK?

489
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:22,082
You didn't see it.
He was wild-eyed, all right?

490
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:24,316
He was frothing at the mouth
at one point.

491
00:24:24,406 --> 00:24:27,159
It was like running a marathon
with Cujo, OK?

492
00:24:27,246 --> 00:24:30,363
Jake, buddy,
can I control the bed, please?

493
00:24:30,446 --> 00:24:32,277
No, but you can watch me
control it.

494
00:24:34,766 --> 00:24:36,199
Libby? Where are you?

495
00:24:36,286 --> 00:24:37,514
- The hospital.
- Are you with him?

496
00:24:37,606 --> 00:24:38,561
No, he's not here.

497
00:24:38,646 --> 00:24:39,635
Well, what do you mean
he's not there?

498
00:24:39,726 --> 00:24:41,079
I mean, he's not here.

499
00:24:41,726 --> 00:24:43,159
Well,
where the hell is he then?

500
00:25:12,246 --> 00:25:14,806
All right.
It's still-- It's on.

501
00:25:14,886 --> 00:25:16,001
The race is still on.

502
00:25:16,846 --> 00:25:19,406
I can't believe
you let Gordon go, Vincent.

503
00:25:19,486 --> 00:25:20,601
- Yeah, but he said
he was gonna pay us...
- Back to the story.

504
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:22,517
- right, Vincent?
- The first images
are coming in...

505
00:25:22,606 --> 00:25:24,358
- from what looks
like a camera phone...
- Vincent?

506
00:25:24,446 --> 00:25:26,835
- Vincent?
- showing a lone,
mysterious runner.

507
00:25:26,926 --> 00:25:30,157
Uh, he's looking very badly
injured, I must say...

508
00:25:30,246 --> 00:25:32,157
and he's also causing
some major traffic--

509
00:25:33,886 --> 00:25:35,114
- Cab.
- Yeah, it's a Rolex.

510
00:25:35,206 --> 00:25:37,242
I'm not gonna sell it.
It's a family heirloom now.

511
00:25:38,246 --> 00:25:39,281
What!

512
00:25:40,686 --> 00:25:42,517
Wait! What are you doing?!

513
00:25:42,606 --> 00:25:45,120
- Step on it!
- You can't
just take a man's cab!

514
00:25:46,966 --> 00:25:47,921
All right!

515
00:25:48,006 --> 00:25:49,121
Hello, there...

516
00:25:49,206 --> 00:25:51,003
Dennis Doyle from downstairs!

517
00:25:51,086 --> 00:25:52,314
Who the hell are you?

518
00:25:53,606 --> 00:25:55,039
You beauty, come on!

519
00:25:56,326 --> 00:25:57,998
And as the sun
sets over London...

520
00:25:58,086 --> 00:25:59,644
we're still looking
into the identity...

521
00:25:59,726 --> 00:26:02,399
of that mysterious runner.

522
00:26:02,486 --> 00:26:04,875
Come on, Dennis,
you can do it! Come on!

523
00:26:04,966 --> 00:26:06,684
The only concrete thing
we do know...

524
00:26:06,766 --> 00:26:10,202
is that he's running
for erectile dysfunction.

525
00:26:12,046 --> 00:26:13,877
Good news, Mr Bloom.

526
00:26:13,966 --> 00:26:16,161
No rupture, no ligament damage.

527
00:26:16,246 --> 00:26:17,804
Oh, that's great.

528
00:26:17,886 --> 00:26:18,875
Jake, please?

529
00:26:18,966 --> 00:26:21,639
In fact,
there's no real damage anywhere.

530
00:26:22,526 --> 00:26:23,515
Are you sure, doctor?

531
00:26:23,606 --> 00:26:25,085
Jake, please.

532
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:27,236
It's, uh, like, uh...

533
00:26:27,326 --> 00:26:28,281
What is it you runners say?

534
00:26:28,366 --> 00:26:29,799
You hit the wall.

535
00:26:31,606 --> 00:26:33,244
No, no, that--
That's not possi--

536
00:26:35,046 --> 00:26:36,274
God damn it, will you stop...

537
00:26:36,366 --> 00:26:38,357
messin' around with the bed,
you little shit?!

538
00:26:39,886 --> 00:26:40,955
God.

539
00:26:47,206 --> 00:26:49,401
Good evening.
It's time for a sports update.

540
00:26:49,486 --> 00:26:51,204
Top story, the Nike River Run.

541
00:26:51,286 --> 00:26:53,083
We'll be chatting to the winner
a little bit later on...

542
00:26:53,166 --> 00:26:55,521
but first, we've had thousands
of e-mails and calls...

543
00:26:55,606 --> 00:26:57,164
about our mystery runner.

544
00:26:57,246 --> 00:26:58,884
Well, I can tell you now,
our TV crew...

545
00:26:58,966 --> 00:27:00,001
has just caught up with him.

546
00:27:00,086 --> 00:27:01,041
Excuse me. Sorry.

547
00:27:01,126 --> 00:27:02,275
Will you slow down, please?

548
00:27:08,086 --> 00:27:09,724
You hungry?
You wanna get a bite?

549
00:27:09,806 --> 00:27:11,558
Stop! Stop!

550
00:27:11,646 --> 00:27:12,874
Everyone out. Get out.

551
00:27:14,086 --> 00:27:15,121
- Come on!
- I'm goin'!

552
00:27:15,206 --> 00:27:16,321
Hey!

553
00:27:16,406 --> 00:27:17,555
Just go away!

554
00:27:18,406 --> 00:27:19,555
- Somebody trip him.
- Go away!

555
00:27:19,646 --> 00:27:20,874
Knock him over.

556
00:27:20,966 --> 00:27:22,718
No, invalid. Off-side.

557
00:27:23,526 --> 00:27:25,278
- Oh!
- Leave him alone! Get off him!

558
00:27:25,366 --> 00:27:27,038
I want my money now!

559
00:27:27,126 --> 00:27:28,639
Don't listen to them, Dennis!

560
00:27:28,726 --> 00:27:29,715
You are a winner!

561
00:27:29,806 --> 00:27:30,841
I want my money now!

562
00:27:30,926 --> 00:27:33,281
Stop it! I'm wearing helmet!

563
00:27:33,366 --> 00:27:34,321
Clear off!

564
00:27:34,406 --> 00:27:36,601
"The loneliness
of the long-distance runner"...

565
00:27:36,686 --> 00:27:39,837
a phrase epitomized by this man,
Dennis Doyle.

566
00:27:39,926 --> 00:27:41,564
For the last eleven miles,
he's been running...

567
00:27:41,646 --> 00:27:44,718
on what appears to be
a severely sprained ankle.

568
00:27:44,806 --> 00:27:47,878
What a testament to the power
of the human spirit.

569
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:49,399
Mr Doyle, how do you feel?

570
00:27:49,486 --> 00:27:50,805
How the fuck
do you think I feel?

571
00:27:50,886 --> 00:27:52,160
What an inspiration.

572
00:27:52,246 --> 00:27:54,840
We'll keep you updated
as this story progresses.

573
00:27:54,926 --> 00:27:56,757
- Get out of the bloody way!
- Sorry.

574
00:27:56,846 --> 00:27:58,882
- Well, what a remarkable day...
- Libby. Libby, I'm sorry...

575
00:27:58,966 --> 00:28:00,638
- we've had at
the marathon on the Thames...
- all right? I lost it. I--

576
00:28:00,726 --> 00:28:02,318
- with an event
dominated as ever...
- I wasn't thinking.

577
00:28:02,406 --> 00:28:04,078
- by the crowds
and the fun runners...
- I'm sorry.

578
00:28:04,166 --> 00:28:05,645
- Honey, can we just--
- but particularly by

579
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:06,681
- Jake, buddy...
- one man.

580
00:28:06,766 --> 00:28:07,721
would you mind just giving us...

581
00:28:07,806 --> 00:28:09,239
a little peace with the TV,
please?

582
00:28:09,726 --> 00:28:10,681
- Thank you.
- Go on, Dennis!

583
00:28:10,766 --> 00:28:11,721
The whole of London...

584
00:28:11,806 --> 00:28:14,001
Honey, can we
just talk about this, please?

585
00:28:17,246 --> 00:28:18,804
- Chin up!
- Keep it up, mate!

586
00:28:20,526 --> 00:28:22,005
Do you know, Mr Doyle, sir?

587
00:28:22,086 --> 00:28:23,041
Oh.

588
00:28:23,126 --> 00:28:24,844
I'm the assistant coach.

589
00:28:24,926 --> 00:28:26,484
Oh. Oh, really.
What's your name?

590
00:28:26,566 --> 00:28:29,638
- Uh, Mr Ghoshdashtidar.
- Gosh--

591
00:28:29,726 --> 00:28:30,681
- Ghosh...
- Gah--

592
00:28:30,766 --> 00:28:32,358
OK, just call me John.

593
00:28:33,606 --> 00:28:36,404
It was me who discovered
his potential.

594
00:28:40,806 --> 00:28:42,125
I can't breathe.

595
00:28:42,886 --> 00:28:44,080
My head's gonna explode.

596
00:28:44,166 --> 00:28:45,724
He's not gonna make it.

597
00:28:45,806 --> 00:28:47,364
I-- I have to stop.

598
00:28:47,446 --> 00:28:48,765
- I have to stop this.
- No.

599
00:28:48,846 --> 00:28:49,915
- I'm sorry.
- No, you can't.
What are you doing?

600
00:28:50,006 --> 00:28:51,155
You can't stop.
You're nearly there.

601
00:28:51,246 --> 00:28:52,645
What? How much further?

602
00:28:52,726 --> 00:28:55,957
It-- It's a little, tiny--
Nine miles.

603
00:28:59,086 --> 00:29:00,644
OK. OK.

604
00:29:15,526 --> 00:29:16,720
Oh, no.

605
00:29:17,726 --> 00:29:18,841
What?

606
00:29:20,206 --> 00:29:21,400
He's hit it.

607
00:29:40,086 --> 00:29:41,804
OK, baby,
let's get you to bed.

608
00:29:42,526 --> 00:29:43,481
Jakey.

609
00:29:43,566 --> 00:29:45,557
-...by the crowds
and the fun runners.
- Dennis.

610
00:29:45,646 --> 00:29:47,079
- For those of you
just joining us...
- Dennis?

611
00:29:47,166 --> 00:29:49,760
it looks like Dennis Doyle, a
clothing store security guard...

612
00:29:49,846 --> 00:29:51,757
running for the last ten
and three quarter hours...

613
00:29:51,846 --> 00:29:53,643
on basically one leg...

614
00:29:53,726 --> 00:29:57,162
is refusing to rest
until this race is run.

615
00:29:57,246 --> 00:29:59,237
Unbelievable!

616
00:30:27,686 --> 00:30:30,439
You've never finished anything
in your entire life, Dennis.

617
00:30:32,486 --> 00:30:34,716
All you're gonna
wanna do is give up.

618
00:30:34,806 --> 00:30:36,080
I'm not the quitter!

619
00:30:36,166 --> 00:30:38,122
That's exactly
what you're gonna do, Dennis.

620
00:30:38,206 --> 00:30:40,276
Go on, run away!
Run away!

621
00:30:40,366 --> 00:30:41,879
That's what you always do!

622
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:45,961
Dennis!

623
00:30:48,246 --> 00:30:49,281
Dennis!

624
00:30:52,646 --> 00:30:53,999
Dennis?

625
00:31:01,806 --> 00:31:03,205
Oh, I don't believe this.

626
00:31:03,286 --> 00:31:04,605
Yeah, boy, yes!

627
00:31:04,686 --> 00:31:06,165
He's still going!

628
00:31:06,246 --> 00:31:09,283
Go on, you beautiful man!

629
00:31:09,366 --> 00:31:11,243
Apologies there,
ladies and gentlemen, uh...

630
00:31:11,326 --> 00:31:13,886
but it's, uh, really rather hard
not to get caught up...

631
00:31:13,966 --> 00:31:15,285
in the drama of it all.

632
00:31:16,286 --> 00:31:19,198
Now let's take one more look
at how Dennis broke that ankle.

633
00:31:19,286 --> 00:31:20,321
And here it is.

634
00:31:20,406 --> 00:31:21,759
It appears
that the runner there...

635
00:31:21,846 --> 00:31:24,997
next to Mr Doyle
is involved in some way.

636
00:31:25,086 --> 00:31:28,635
In fact, if we look at it again
here...yes!

637
00:31:28,726 --> 00:31:30,796
He deliberately trips him!

638
00:31:30,886 --> 00:31:32,399
Bastard!

639
00:31:32,486 --> 00:31:33,714
Apologies again, uh...

640
00:31:33,806 --> 00:31:35,683
That didn't--
That's not what happened.

641
00:31:35,766 --> 00:31:37,199
That is--
That-- That didn't happen.

642
00:31:37,286 --> 00:31:38,844
I can't believe this.

643
00:31:38,926 --> 00:31:39,881
I don't believe it, either.

644
00:31:39,966 --> 00:31:40,921
I don't understand that.

645
00:31:41,006 --> 00:31:41,961
What is that?

646
00:31:42,046 --> 00:31:43,399
Honey. Honey...

647
00:31:43,486 --> 00:31:47,445
That angle makes it look, but--
He tripped me.

648
00:31:48,486 --> 00:31:50,283
He tripped me! Yes, he did!

649
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:52,960
- Go, Dennis!
- It's him! Dennis!

650
00:31:54,886 --> 00:31:56,114
Go, Dennis!

651
00:31:59,646 --> 00:32:00,920
I can't believe this.

652
00:32:01,006 --> 00:32:02,200
Come on, honey.

653
00:32:02,286 --> 00:32:03,605
Please, like I'm gonna do that.

654
00:32:04,246 --> 00:32:05,474
What are you--
Are you kidding me?

655
00:32:05,566 --> 00:32:06,681
Honey.

656
00:32:08,166 --> 00:32:09,315
All right, look,
I'm just-- I'm not--

657
00:32:09,406 --> 00:32:10,839
I'm not myself, OK?

658
00:32:11,966 --> 00:32:13,604
I haven't been myself
for a long time.

659
00:32:13,686 --> 00:32:15,119
Work has not been...

660
00:32:15,926 --> 00:32:17,723
It's, uh...

661
00:32:17,806 --> 00:32:18,761
It's just this city, you know?

662
00:32:18,846 --> 00:32:20,757
It's just--
It's really hard here for me.

663
00:32:20,846 --> 00:32:22,359
You know,
everyone's so polite here...

664
00:32:22,446 --> 00:32:24,402
and it's like the food and the--
and the--and the ca--

665
00:32:24,486 --> 00:32:25,805
I just don't-- I don't
know what happened to me.

666
00:32:25,886 --> 00:32:27,524
I don't know what--
It's just this place.

667
00:32:27,606 --> 00:32:28,675
It's this place, you know?

668
00:32:28,766 --> 00:32:31,599
And if we-- I just know it's
gonna be better once we move.

669
00:32:31,686 --> 00:32:33,199
- Move?
- To Chicago.

670
00:32:33,286 --> 00:32:34,480
What?

671
00:32:34,566 --> 00:32:35,715
Too soon?

672
00:32:35,806 --> 00:32:36,761
Oh!

673
00:32:36,846 --> 00:32:38,325
- Come on, Jake.
- Libby, wh--

674
00:32:38,406 --> 00:32:39,600
Where you goin'?
Where you goin'?

675
00:32:40,646 --> 00:32:42,477
Oh, you got to be kidding me.
Dennis?

676
00:32:42,566 --> 00:32:43,760
You can't be serious.

677
00:32:43,846 --> 00:32:46,644
The guy left you
at the altar pregnant.

678
00:32:48,446 --> 00:32:49,720
Nobody's perfect.

679
00:32:50,846 --> 00:32:51,801
Libby.

680
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:53,478
Libby! L--

681
00:32:53,566 --> 00:32:54,555
What a shithead.

682
00:32:54,646 --> 00:32:55,681
Jake.

683
00:32:56,966 --> 00:32:58,524
Hey. I know you feel bad.

684
00:32:58,606 --> 00:32:59,595
I know you're
in incredible pain...

685
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:01,995
but you are so close
to me going on holiday.

686
00:33:02,846 --> 00:33:03,881
Come on.

687
00:33:18,606 --> 00:33:21,074
Dennis! Dennis! Dennis!

688
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:24,238
Dennis! Dennis! Dennis!

689
00:33:24,326 --> 00:33:28,399
Dennis! Dennis! Dennis!

690
00:33:28,486 --> 00:33:31,080
As we draw tantalizingly
close to the finish line...

691
00:33:31,166 --> 00:33:32,804
here at St. Paul's Cathedral...

692
00:33:32,886 --> 00:33:35,241
it's safe to say,
it's been a very long day...

693
00:33:35,326 --> 00:33:37,078
for myself and my cameraman.

694
00:33:37,166 --> 00:33:39,919
It's been a very long day
for you watching at home...

695
00:33:40,006 --> 00:33:40,961
but for Dennis Doyle...

696
00:33:41,046 --> 00:33:43,514
it's been the single longest day
of his life.

697
00:33:57,806 --> 00:33:58,841
Come on, Dennis!

698
00:33:59,806 --> 00:34:00,841
Good work, Dennis!

699
00:34:04,926 --> 00:34:06,405
Hey! Move along!

700
00:34:06,486 --> 00:34:07,441
That's it. You're there.

701
00:34:07,526 --> 00:34:09,164
You're sixty feet.

702
00:34:09,246 --> 00:34:10,520
Fifty-- Fifty-eight feet.

703
00:34:11,526 --> 00:34:12,675
Call it fifty-six
and a half feet...

704
00:34:12,766 --> 00:34:13,721
and you're there. Come on.

705
00:34:13,806 --> 00:34:16,798
That's my man! My man!

706
00:34:25,166 --> 00:34:26,235
Come on, come on!

707
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:35,841
Dennis, come on.

708
00:34:37,926 --> 00:34:39,996
Stay down, you shamble of a man.

709
00:34:40,086 --> 00:34:41,201
Don't get up.

710
00:34:43,246 --> 00:34:44,281
Dennis!

711
00:34:45,206 --> 00:34:46,275
Dennis, come on, get up.

712
00:34:46,366 --> 00:34:47,845
Dennis, you're
at the finish line. Get up.

713
00:34:48,886 --> 00:34:50,478
Dennis, this looks bad.
People are talking.

714
00:34:50,566 --> 00:34:51,601
Get up.

715
00:35:05,086 --> 00:35:06,121
Hello, Dennis?

716
00:35:10,326 --> 00:35:12,203
- Dennis!
- Dad!

717
00:35:17,486 --> 00:35:19,716
Dennis!

718
00:35:19,806 --> 00:35:20,841
Dad!

719
00:35:37,286 --> 00:35:38,958
Go on! You've got it! Go on!

720
00:35:42,086 --> 00:35:44,156
Come on, Dennis! Yeah!

721
00:35:47,966 --> 00:35:49,001
Yeah!

722
00:35:53,406 --> 00:35:54,441
Dad!

723
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:57,554
That was a really stupid thing
you did out there today.

724
00:35:57,646 --> 00:35:59,398
Don't go to Chicago.

725
00:35:59,486 --> 00:36:00,999
Dad, you won!

726
00:36:05,286 --> 00:36:06,560
He's done it!

727
00:36:06,646 --> 00:36:08,284
He's actually done it!

728
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:09,435
This morning...

729
00:36:09,526 --> 00:36:12,882
Dennis Doyle was a humble
shop worker from North London!

730
00:36:12,966 --> 00:36:15,434
Tonight, he goes home a hero!

731
00:36:15,526 --> 00:36:17,244
Oh, yay.

732
00:36:17,326 --> 00:36:18,520
And look at that!

733
00:36:18,606 --> 00:36:19,721
- God damn it.
- This extraordinary man...

734
00:36:19,806 --> 00:36:21,637
collapses into the arms of--

735
00:36:21,726 --> 00:36:24,081
I think it's backwards here--
the woman he loves!

736
00:36:24,166 --> 00:36:26,555
And, look! He's got a son!

737
00:36:26,646 --> 00:36:28,602
I didn't know he had a son!

738
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,199
Did you know he had a son?

739
00:36:41,006 --> 00:36:42,724
- Hello, Dennis.
- Hey.

740
00:36:55,726 --> 00:36:57,205
- Hi.
- Hi.

741
00:36:57,286 --> 00:36:58,924
Jake, your dad's here!

742
00:36:59,006 --> 00:37:00,485
How's it goin'?

743
00:37:00,566 --> 00:37:01,794
- Pretty good.
- Good.

744
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,160
- You?
- Yeah.

745
00:37:03,246 --> 00:37:04,645
Yeah, not bad.

746
00:37:04,726 --> 00:37:05,795
You still running?

747
00:37:05,886 --> 00:37:07,763
Every day, hopefully
in the right direction.

748
00:37:11,366 --> 00:37:12,924
Yeah. So...

749
00:37:14,326 --> 00:37:18,114
Um, Libby,
I was thinkin', um...

750
00:37:20,486 --> 00:37:22,841
- Hi, Dad.
- Hey, you.

751
00:37:25,606 --> 00:37:26,561
Uh, it doesn't matter,
actually.

752
00:37:26,646 --> 00:37:27,840
I'll, um...

753
00:37:27,926 --> 00:37:29,120
I'll sp-- I'll ca--
I'll speak to you later.

754
00:37:29,206 --> 00:37:30,719
- OK.
- Say goodbye to your mom.

755
00:37:30,806 --> 00:37:31,875
Bye, Mom.

756
00:37:31,966 --> 00:37:32,921
Bye. I'll see you later.

757
00:37:33,006 --> 00:37:34,121
Bye.

758
00:37:44,086 --> 00:37:45,963
Libby, I was wondering,
would you like to go...

759
00:37:46,046 --> 00:37:47,877
and have some dinner
with me next week?

760
00:37:52,766 --> 00:37:53,721
You don't have to.
It's not, uh...

761
00:37:53,806 --> 00:37:54,955
Yeah.

762
00:37:55,046 --> 00:37:56,320
Uh...huh?

763
00:37:56,406 --> 00:37:57,885
I mean, wow.

764
00:37:57,966 --> 00:37:59,035
It'd be nice.

765
00:37:59,126 --> 00:38:00,923
Yeah. Well, it would be.

766
00:38:05,046 --> 00:38:06,764
I'll, um...
I'll give you a call.

767
00:38:06,846 --> 00:38:07,835
OK.

768
00:38:07,926 --> 00:38:09,359
Don't know why I did that.
It's just--

769
00:38:10,886 --> 00:38:12,160
OK. Ready?

770
00:38:12,246 --> 00:38:13,281
Yeah.

771
00:38:15,646 --> 00:38:17,398
Hello!

772
00:38:17,486 --> 00:38:18,965
Hello, Dennis!

773
00:38:20,526 --> 00:38:21,720
Mr G.

774
00:38:22,246 --> 00:38:24,123
- Hello, Jake.
- Hello.

775
00:38:24,206 --> 00:38:25,764
I was just doing my spin class.

776
00:38:25,846 --> 00:38:26,801
It's great fun, isn't it?

777
00:38:26,886 --> 00:38:29,241
Oh, it's an amazing workout!

778
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:36,884
Dad comin' up behind
the young contender.

779
00:38:36,966 --> 00:38:38,115
Come on! Jake!

780
00:38:38,206 --> 00:38:39,764
Oh, he takes the ball from Jake!

781
00:38:39,846 --> 00:38:42,155
He has the ball! He's clear!

782
00:38:42,246 --> 00:38:43,565
Dad! Pass it!

783
00:38:44,926 --> 00:38:45,881
Dad is clear!

784
00:38:45,966 --> 00:38:47,638
Give it!

785
00:38:47,726 --> 00:38:49,478
I'll give you one, too.

786
00:38:49,566 --> 00:38:51,557
OK, let's go. Good game.

787
00:38:51,646 --> 00:38:53,238
Jake to Mr G.

788
00:38:54,046 --> 00:38:55,445
Yeah, thank you very much.

789
00:38:55,526 --> 00:38:56,595
Take over, Mr G.

790
00:38:57,806 --> 00:38:58,955
There you go, Mr G.

791
00:38:59,806 --> 00:39:02,525
All right, I'm gonna--
Completely illegal move there.

792
00:39:02,606 --> 00:39:04,358
Picks up the player,
runs with him.

793
00:39:04,446 --> 00:39:05,765
Runs with him all the way.

794
00:39:05,846 --> 00:39:07,325
Dad, that's illegal!

795
00:39:11,966 --> 00:39:13,001
But that's not all.

796
00:39:13,686 --> 00:39:15,597
Because the guy,
he can't barely walk, OK...

797
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:17,597
Iet alone run,
but he keeps going...

798
00:39:17,686 --> 00:39:20,405
and twenty-five miles
on a shattered ankle.

799
00:39:20,486 --> 00:39:21,475
And you know how he did that?

800
00:39:21,566 --> 00:39:22,715
You know what he said
was the one thing...

801
00:39:22,806 --> 00:39:23,841
that kept him going?

802
00:39:24,966 --> 00:39:26,194
His trainer
never gave up on him.
