1
00:00:12,993 --> 00:00:18,916
All right, everyone! This... is a stickup!
Don't anybody move!

2
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:23,005
Now, empty that safe!

3
00:00:23,172 --> 00:00:26,009
Ooh-hoo-hoo! Money, money, money!

4
00:00:26,217 --> 00:00:28,387
Stop it! Stop it,
you mean, old potato!

5
00:00:28,638 --> 00:00:31,642
Quiet, Bo Peep,
or your sheep get run over!

6
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:33,602
Help! Baa!
Help us!

7
00:00:33,852 --> 00:00:40,527
Oh, no, not my sheep!
Somebody do something!

8
00:00:43,656 --> 00:00:46,451
Reach for the sky!

9
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,954
Oh, no! Sheriff Woody!

10
00:00:49,163 --> 00:00:51,749
I'm here to stop you,
One-Eyed Bart.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,378
Doh!
How'd you know it was me?

12
00:00:54,586 --> 00:00:56,172
Are you gonna
come quietly?

13
00:00:56,381 --> 00:01:00,928
You can't touch me, Sheriff!
I brought my attack dog
with the built-in force field

14
00:01:01,136 --> 00:01:04,808
Well, I brought my dinosaur
who eats force-field dogs.

15
00:01:05,016 --> 00:01:07,310
- Yipe, yipe, yipe, yipe!

16
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:16,698
You're going to jail, Bart!
Say good-bye to the wife and later tots.

17
00:01:20,577 --> 00:01:22,746
You saved the day again, Woody.

18
00:01:22,955 --> 00:01:25,583
You're my favorite deputy.

19
00:01:25,792 --> 00:01:29,964
# You've got a friend in me #

20
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:32,216
# You've got a friend in me #

21
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:34,219
Come on, let's
wrangle up the cattle.

22
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:37,557
# When the road looks
rough ahead #

23
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:41,020
# And you're miles and miles
from your nice, warm bed #

24
00:01:41,228 --> 00:01:45,483
- Round 'em up, cowboy!
- # Just remember
what your old pal said #

25
00:01:45,692 --> 00:01:48,069
# Boy, you've got
a friend in me #

26
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:51,741
- Yee-haw!
-# Yeah, you've got a friend in me #

27
00:01:51,949 --> 00:01:53,827
Hey, cowboy!

28
00:01:54,036 --> 00:01:58,207
# Some other folks might be
a little bit smarter than I am #

29
00:01:58,416 --> 00:02:00,293
-# Big and stronger too #

30
00:02:00,501 --> 00:02:02,296
- Come on, Woody.
-# Maybe #

31
00:02:02,463 --> 00:02:07,594
# But none of them will ever
love you the way I do #

32
00:02:07,802 --> 00:02:09,680
-# It's me and you, boy #

33
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:12,308
-# And as the years go by #
- Whoa!

34
00:02:12,475 --> 00:02:17,815
- Whoa!
-# Our friendship will never die #

35
00:02:18,024 --> 00:02:20,026
- Whoo!
-# You're gonna see #

36
00:02:20,193 --> 00:02:23,155
-# It's our destiny #

37
00:02:23,322 --> 00:02:26,701
-# You've got a friend in me #
- All right!

38
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:30,122
-# Yeah, you've got a friend in me #
- Score!

39
00:02:30,331 --> 00:02:33,668
-# You got a friend in me #
- Wow! Cool!

40
00:02:33,876 --> 00:02:37,005
- What do you think?
- Oh, this looks great, Mom!

41
00:02:37,214 --> 00:02:40,468
- Okay, birthday boy-
- We saw that at the store!
I asked you for it!

42
00:02:40,635 --> 00:02:42,429
- I hope I have enough places.
- Wow, look at that! That's so--

43
00:02:42,638 --> 00:02:45,557
- One, two- Four. Yeah,
I think that's gonna be enough.
- Oh, my gosh, you got--

44
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:47,852
- Could we leave this up till we move?
- Well, sure!

45
00:02:48,061 --> 00:02:50,355
- We can leave it up. Now go get Molly.
- Yeah!

46
00:02:50,564 --> 00:02:54,193
- Your friends are gonna
be here any minute.
- Okay. It's party time, Woody.

47
00:02:54,443 --> 00:02:57,739
- Yee...haw!

48
00:03:03,831 --> 00:03:07,877
Howdy, little lady.

49
00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:11,424
Somebody's poisoned
the water hole.

50
00:03:11,632 --> 00:03:14,677
- Come on, Molly.
Oh, you're getting heavy.

51
00:03:14,885 --> 00:03:19,350
- See you later, Woody.

52
00:03:24,982 --> 00:03:30,822
Pull my string!
The birthday party's today?

53
00:03:31,031 --> 00:03:36,455
Okay, everybody,
coast is clear!

54
00:03:38,665 --> 00:03:42,086
- Ages 3 and up. It's on my box.

55
00:03:42,295 --> 00:03:51,264
Ages 3 and up. I'm not supposed
to be baby-sitting Princess Drool.

56
00:03:57,522 --> 00:03:59,274
- Hey, Hamm.

57
00:03:59,524 --> 00:04:02,945
- Look, I'm Picasso!
- I don't get it.

58
00:04:03,154 --> 00:04:11,623
You uncultured swine! What're
you lookin' at, ya hockey puck?

59
00:04:12,123 --> 00:04:14,335
- Hey, Sarge, have you seen Slinky?
- Sir! No, sir!

60
00:04:14,502 --> 00:04:19,716
Okay. Hey, thank you. At ease.

61
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,845
Right here, Woody.
I'm red this time.

62
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:26,934
- No. S-Slink-
- Oh, well, all right.
You can be red if you want.

63
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:29,437
- N-Not now, Slink. I got some bad news.
- Bad news?

64
00:04:29,646 --> 00:04:31,940
Shh, shh, shh!

65
00:04:32,148 --> 00:04:34,985
- Just gather everyone up
for a staff meeting, and be happy.
- Got it.

66
00:04:35,194 --> 00:04:36,947
- Be happy!
- Ha, ha, ha, ha!

67
00:04:37,155 --> 00:04:40,910
- Staff meeting, everybody!
Snake, Robot, podium please.

68
00:04:41,119 --> 00:04:43,621
Hey.

69
00:04:44,956 --> 00:04:48,752
Hey, Etch. Draw!

70
00:04:49,044 --> 00:04:51,339
- Oh! Got me again.

71
00:04:51,548 --> 00:04:55,010
Etch, you've been working
on that draw. Fastest knobs in the west.

72
00:04:55,177 --> 00:04:57,931
Got a staff meeting, you guys.
Come on, let's go.

73
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,600
Now, where is that-- Oh.

74
00:05:00,851 --> 00:05:05,106
Hey, who moved my doodle pad
way over here?

75
00:05:05,314 --> 00:05:08,944
- How're you doin', Rex?
- Were you scared? Tell me honestly.

76
00:05:09,194 --> 00:05:11,364
I was close to being scared that time.

77
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,754
I'm going for fearsome here,
but I just don't feel it.

78
00:05:14,921 --> 00:05:17,131
I think I'm just
coming off as annoying.

79
00:05:17,341 --> 00:05:20,260
Owl Oh, hi, Bo. Hi.

80
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:23,390
I wanted to thank you, Woody,
for saving my flock.

81
00:05:23,598 --> 00:05:25,893
Oh, hey,
it was, uh, nothin'.

82
00:05:26,102 --> 00:05:31,233
What do you say I get someone else
to watch the sheep tonight?

83
00:05:31,441 --> 00:05:33,903
Oh, yeah!

84
00:05:34,153 --> 00:05:38,075
Remember, I'm just
a couple of blocks away.

85
00:05:38,325 --> 00:05:43,206
- Yodel-ay-hee-hoo!
- Come on, come on.
Smaller toys up front.

86
00:05:43,415 --> 00:05:47,586
Hey, Woody, come on.

87
00:05:48,422 --> 00:05:50,215
- Ahem!

88
00:05:50,382 --> 00:05:52,802
- Oh, thanks, Mike.

89
00:05:53,011 --> 00:05:55,514
- Okay- Whoa, whoa. Step back.

90
00:05:55,723 --> 00:05:58,142
- For crying out loud.
- Thank you.

91
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:01,146
- Hello? Check.
That better? Great.

92
00:06:01,354 --> 00:06:05,109
Everybody hear me? Up on the shelf,
can you hear me? Great.

93
00:06:05,318 --> 00:06:08,322
Okay. First item today:

94
00:06:08,572 --> 00:06:11,784
Uh... oh, yeah.
Has everyone picked a moving buddy?

95
00:06:11,993 --> 00:06:14,495
- What?
- Moving buddy? You can't be serious.

96
00:06:14,705 --> 00:06:16,790
I didn't know we were
supposed to have one already.

97
00:06:16,999 --> 00:06:19,294
- Do we have to hold hands?

98
00:06:19,502 --> 00:06:21,671
You guys think
this is a big joke.

99
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,216
We've only got one week
left before the move.

100
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:26,803
I don't want any toys left behind.
A moving buddy.

101
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:29,723
If you don't have one,
get one!

102
00:06:29,932 --> 00:06:32,852
All right, next.
Uh, oh, yes.

103
00:06:33,061 --> 00:06:36,190
Tuesday night's plastic corrosion
awareness meeting...

104
00:06:36,398 --> 00:06:38,693
was, I think,
a big success.

105
00:06:38,902 --> 00:06:41,822
And we wanna thank Mr. Spell
for putting that on for us.

106
00:06:42,031 --> 00:06:44,617
- Thank you, Mr. Spell.
- You're welcome.

107
00:06:44,825 --> 00:06:48,080
Okay. Uh, oh, yes.
One, uh, minor note here.

108
00:06:48,288 --> 00:06:51,209
Andy's birthday party
has been moved to today.

109
00:06:51,417 --> 00:06:53,504
- Wait a minute here!

110
00:06:53,712 --> 00:06:55,798
What do you mean the party's today?
His birthday's not till next week!

111
00:06:56,006 --> 00:06:58,510
What's goin' on down there?
Is his mom losin' her marbles?

112
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:02,348
Well, obviously she wanted to
have the party before the move.

113
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:05,602
- I'm not worried.
You shouldn't be worried.
- Of course Woody ain't worried.

114
00:07:05,811 --> 00:07:07,896
He's been Andy's favorite
since kindergarten.

115
00:07:08,106 --> 00:07:10,191
Hey, hey.
Come on, Potato Head.

116
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,654
If Woody says it's all right, then,
well, darn it, it's good enough for me.

117
00:07:13,821 --> 00:07:16,449
Woody has never
steered us wrong before.

118
00:07:16,658 --> 00:07:20,204
Come on, guys. Every Christmas
and birthday we go through this.

119
00:07:20,413 --> 00:07:23,207
But what if Andy gets
another dinosaur, a mean one?

120
00:07:23,417 --> 00:07:26,169
I just don't think I could take
that kind of rejection!

121
00:07:26,336 --> 00:07:28,548
Hey, listen,
no one's getting replaced.

122
00:07:28,756 --> 00:07:31,051
This is Andy
we're talking about.

123
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:37,726
It doesn't matter
how much we're played with.

124
00:07:37,934 --> 00:07:40,855
What matters is that we're here
for Andy when he needs us.

125
00:07:41,063 --> 00:07:42,941
That's what we're
made for, right?

126
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:46,821
Pardon me. I hate to break up the staff
meeting, but... they're here!

127
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:48,781
Birthday guests
at three o'clock!

128
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:51,076
- Stay calm, everyone!

129
00:07:51,285 --> 00:07:53,454
Hey!

130
00:07:53,662 --> 00:07:55,540
- Uh, meeting adjourned.

131
00:07:55,749 --> 00:07:58,085
Ho, boy! Will you take a look
at all those presents?

132
00:07:58,294 --> 00:08:02,466
I can't see a thing.

133
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:06,929
Yes, sir, we're next month's
garage sale fodder for sure.

134
00:08:07,092 --> 00:08:10,972
- Any dinosaur-shaped ones?
- Oh, for crying out loud.
They're all in boxes, you idiot.

135
00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:12,933
They're getting bigger.

136
00:08:13,142 --> 00:08:19,399
- Wait, there's a nice
little one over there.
- Hi!

137
00:08:19,607 --> 00:08:21,277
- Spell: trash can.
- We're doomed!

138
00:08:21,485 --> 00:08:23,070
All right! All right!

139
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:27,242
If I send out the troops,
will you all calm down?

140
00:08:27,452 --> 00:08:30,956
- Yes! Yes! We promise!
- Okay! Save your batteries.

141
00:08:31,165 --> 00:08:35,253
Very good, Woody.
That's using the old noodle.

142
00:08:35,462 --> 00:08:40,051
Sergeant, establish
a recon post downstairs. Code Red!

143
00:08:40,259 --> 00:08:42,637
- You know what to do.
- Yes, sir!

144
00:08:42,888 --> 00:08:45,265
All right, men.
You heard him. Code Red!

145
00:08:45,474 --> 00:08:48,519
Repeat, we are at Code Red.
Recon plan Charlie. Execute!

146
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:54,444
Let's move!
Move, move, move, move!

147
00:09:09,672 --> 00:09:12,092
- Yeah!

148
00:09:12,258 --> 00:09:14,970
- Okay, come on, kids.

149
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:23,856
Everyone in the living room.
It's almost time for the presents.

150
00:09:39,835 --> 00:09:41,921
All right, gangway, gangway.

151
00:09:42,088 --> 00:09:45,134
And this is
how we find out...

152
00:09:45,342 --> 00:09:50,348
- what is in those presents.

153
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:55,355
Okay, who's hungry?

154
00:09:55,564 --> 00:09:57,232
Here come the chips!

155
00:09:57,441 --> 00:09:59,652
I've got Cool Ranch
and barbecue! Ow!

156
00:09:59,819 --> 00:10:01,821
What in the world-- Oh!

157
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:04,742
- I thought I told him to pick these up.

158
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:07,871
Shouldn't they be there by now?
What's taking them so long?

159
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,000
Hey, these guys are professionals.
They're the best.

160
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:17,800
Come on!
They're not lying down on the job.

161
00:10:24,684 --> 00:10:26,644
G-G-Go on without me!
J-Just go!

162
00:10:26,853 --> 00:10:33,195
A good soldier never
leaves a man behind.

163
00:10:47,171 --> 00:10:49,256
- Okay, everybody, come on.

164
00:10:49,507 --> 00:10:52,302
Everybody settle down.
Now, kids. Everybody-

165
00:10:52,511 --> 00:10:56,391
You sit in a circle. No, Andy.
Andy, you sit in the middle there.

166
00:10:56,557 --> 00:11:00,646
- Good. And- Which present
are you gonna open first?

167
00:11:00,854 --> 00:11:03,566
- Mine!
- There they are.

168
00:11:03,775 --> 00:11:06,696
Come in,
Mother Bird. This is Alpha Bravo.

169
00:11:06,904 --> 00:11:09,408
- This is it! This is it!
Quiet, quiet, quiet!
- Come in, Mother Bird.

170
00:11:09,616 --> 00:11:12,328
Andy's opening the first present now.

171
00:11:12,537 --> 00:11:15,164
Mrs. Potato Head! Mrs. Potato Head!
Mrs. Potato Head!

172
00:11:15,331 --> 00:11:17,126
Hey, I can dream,
can't I?

173
00:11:17,334 --> 00:11:20,380
The bow's coming off.
He's ripping the wrapping paper.

174
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:22,757
It's a- It's-
It's a- a lunch box.

175
00:11:22,966 --> 00:11:25,052
- We've got a lunch box here.
- A lunch box?

176
00:11:25,261 --> 00:11:26,930
- Lunch box?
- For lunch.

177
00:11:27,139 --> 00:11:29,224
Okay, second present.
It appears to be--

178
00:11:29,433 --> 00:11:36,525
- Okay, it's bed sheets.
- Who invited that kid?

179
00:11:37,568 --> 00:11:39,863
Oh! Only one left.

180
00:11:40,071 --> 00:11:42,366
- Okay, we're on the last present now.
- Last present!

181
00:11:42,575 --> 00:11:44,785
It's a big one.
It's a--

182
00:11:44,994 --> 00:11:47,164
- It's a board game!
Repeat, Battleship!
- Whew!

183
00:11:47,372 --> 00:11:49,459
- Hallelujah!

184
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,419
- Yeah! All right!
- Hey, watch it!

185
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,422
Sorry there,
old spud head.

186
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:57,385
Mission accomplished. Well done, men.
Pack it up. We're goin' home.

187
00:11:57,594 --> 00:11:59,889
So did I tell ya?
Huh? Nothin' to worry about.

188
00:12:00,033 --> 00:12:03,246
I knew you were right all along, Woody.
Never doubted ya for a second.

189
00:12:03,496 --> 00:12:06,208
Wait a minute. Oh!

190
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:09,838
- What do we have here?
- Wait! Turn that thing back on!

191
00:12:10,046 --> 00:12:12,466
Come in, Mother Bird!
Come in, Mother Bird!

192
00:12:12,633 --> 00:12:14,635
Mom has pulled a surprise
present from the closet.

193
00:12:14,844 --> 00:12:17,347
Andy's opening it.
He's really excited about this one.

194
00:12:17,556 --> 00:12:19,851
- Mom, what is it?
- It's a huge package.

195
00:12:20,059 --> 00:12:22,563
Oh, get outta the-- One of the kids
is in the way. I can't see.

196
00:12:22,771 --> 00:12:25,774
- It's a--
- Wow!

197
00:12:26,026 --> 00:12:30,281
- It's a what? What is it?

198
00:12:30,489 --> 00:12:32,783
- Oh, no!
- Oh, ya big lizard!

199
00:12:32,993 --> 00:12:35,829
- Now we'll never know what it is!
- Way to go, Rex!

200
00:12:36,038 --> 00:12:38,416
- No, no! Turn him around!
Turn him around!
- He's puttin' 'em in backwa-

201
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:40,377
Here, you're
puttin' 'em in backwards!

202
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:44,049
Plus is positive, minus is negative!
Oh, let me!

203
00:12:44,257 --> 00:12:46,634
- Let's go to my room, guys!

204
00:12:46,886 --> 00:12:49,263
Red alert! Red alert!
Andy is coming upstairs!

205
00:12:49,472 --> 00:12:51,850
- There!
- Juvenile intrusion!

206
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,853
Repeat, resume
your positions now!

207
00:12:54,062 --> 00:12:55,855
Andy's coming! Everybody,
back to your places! Hurry!

208
00:12:56,022 --> 00:12:57,816
Get to your places!
Get to your places!

209
00:12:58,025 --> 00:13:00,528
- Where's my ear? Who's seen my ear?
Did you see my ear?

210
00:13:00,737 --> 00:13:06,994
Out of my way! Here I come!
Here I come!

211
00:13:14,003 --> 00:13:17,633
Hey, look,
its lasers light up. Take that, Zurg!

212
00:13:17,842 --> 00:13:20,553
Quick, make a space.
This is where the spaceship lands.

213
00:13:20,762 --> 00:13:23,683
And he does it like that.
And he does a karate chop action!

214
00:13:23,891 --> 00:13:30,149
Come on down, guys!
It's time for games!

215
00:13:41,122 --> 00:13:42,874
- What is it?
- Can you see it?

216
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:46,504
- What the heck is up there?
- Woody, who's up there with ya?

217
00:13:46,754 --> 00:13:48,715
- Woody?

218
00:13:48,924 --> 00:13:52,261
- What are you doing under the bed?
- Uh, nothin'. Uh, nothin'.

219
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:55,181
I'm sure Andy was just
a little excited, that's all.

220
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:57,685
Too much cake and ice cream,
I suppose. It's just a mistake!

221
00:13:57,893 --> 00:14:01,648
Well, that mistake is sitting
in your spot, Woody.

222
00:14:01,857 --> 00:14:04,777
Have you been replaced? -
What did I tell you earlier?

223
00:14:04,986 --> 00:14:07,364
No one is getting replaced

224
00:14:07,614 --> 00:14:10,618
Now, let's all be polite and give
whatever it is up there...

225
00:14:10,827 --> 00:14:16,250
a nice, big
Andy's-room welcome.

226
00:14:39,197 --> 00:14:41,283
- Buzz Lightyear to Star Command.

227
00:14:41,492 --> 00:14:43,786
Come in, Star Command.

228
00:14:43,994 --> 00:14:46,206
- Star Command, come
in. Do you read me?

229
00:14:46,414 --> 00:14:51,713
Why don't they answer?
My ship!

230
00:14:52,756 --> 00:14:55,968
Blast! This'll take
weeks to repair.

231
00:14:56,219 --> 00:14:59,098
Buzz Lightyear mission log,
stardate 4-0-7-2.

232
00:14:59,348 --> 00:15:02,560
My ship has run off course
en route to sector 12.

233
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:05,189
I've crash-landed
on a strange planet.

234
00:15:05,356 --> 00:15:09,528
The impact must've awoken me
from hypersleep.

235
00:15:09,778 --> 00:15:12,365
Terrain seems
a bit unstable.

236
00:15:12,573 --> 00:15:15,703
No readout yet
if the air is breathable.

237
00:15:15,911 --> 00:15:18,288
And there seems to be no sign
of intelligent life anywhere.

238
00:15:18,539 --> 00:15:20,291
- Hello!

239
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,920
Whoa! H-Hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

240
00:15:23,087 --> 00:15:25,506
- Did I frighten you? Didn't mean to.

241
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:28,135
- Sorry. Howdy. My name is Woody.

242
00:15:28,301 --> 00:15:32,390
And this is Andy's room.
That's all I wanted to say.

243
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:34,893
And also, there has been
a bit of a mix-up.

244
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:37,313
This is my spot, see,
the bed here.

245
00:15:37,522 --> 00:15:39,900
Local law enforcement.
It's about time you got here.

246
00:15:40,109 --> 00:15:42,903
I'm Buzz Lightyear, Space Ranger,
Universe Protection Unit.

247
00:15:43,155 --> 00:15:45,407
My ship has crash-landed
here by mistake.

248
00:15:45,657 --> 00:15:48,870
Yes, it is a mistake because,
you see, the bed here is my spot.

249
00:15:49,078 --> 00:15:51,373
I need to repair
my turbo boosters.

250
00:15:51,582 --> 00:15:53,877
Do you people still use fossil fuel, or
have you discovered crystallic fusion?

251
00:15:54,085 --> 00:15:56,713
- Well, let's see. We got double-A's.

252
00:15:56,881 --> 00:15:58,382
Watch yourself!
Halt! Who goes there?

253
00:15:58,549 --> 00:16:00,761
Don't shoot!
It's okay. Friends.

254
00:16:00,969 --> 00:16:04,724
- Do you know these life-forms?
- Yes! They're Andy's toys.

255
00:16:04,932 --> 00:16:07,018
All right, everyone,
you're clear to come up.

256
00:16:07,227 --> 00:16:09,938
I am Buzz Lightyear.
I come in peace.

257
00:16:10,147 --> 00:16:13,276
Oh, I'm so glad
you're not a dinosaur!

258
00:16:13,485 --> 00:16:15,780
Bye, bye. Thank you!

259
00:16:15,988 --> 00:16:18,784
Now, thank you all
for your kind welcome!

260
00:16:19,034 --> 00:16:21,621
- Say, what's that button do?
- I'll show you.

261
00:16:22,254 --> 00:16:24,965
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!
- Oh!

262
00:16:25,174 --> 00:16:27,385
Hey, Woody's got something like that.
His is a pull string.

263
00:16:27,552 --> 00:16:30,180
- Only it's--
- Only it sounds like a car ran over it.

264
00:16:30,388 --> 00:16:33,643
Oh, yeah, but not like this.
This is a quality sound system.

265
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:35,812
Probably all
copper wiring, huh?

266
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:38,857
So, uh, where you from?
Singapore? Hong Kong?

267
00:16:39,024 --> 00:16:44,989
Well, no. Actually, I-I'm stationed up
in the Gamma Quadrant of Sector Four.

268
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:47,492
As a member of the elite
Universe Protection Unit
of the Space Ranger Corps,

269
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:50,329
I protect the galaxy
from the threat of invasion...

270
00:16:50,496 --> 00:16:54,375
from the evil Emperor Zurg,
sworn enemy of the Galactic Alliance.

271
00:16:54,584 --> 00:16:57,087
Oh, really?
I'm from Playskool.

272
00:16:57,295 --> 00:17:00,215
And I'm from Mattel.
Well, I'm not really from Mattel.

273
00:17:00,424 --> 00:17:02,718
I'm actually from a smaller company that
was purchased in a leveraged buyout.

274
00:17:02,927 --> 00:17:05,429
You'd think they'd never seen
a new toy before.

275
00:17:05,638 --> 00:17:09,893
Well, sure. Look at him. He's got more
gadgets on him than a Swiss Army knife.

276
00:17:10,144 --> 00:17:12,522
- Ah, ah, ah, ah! Please be careful.

277
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:15,358
You don't want to be in the way
when my laser goes off.

278
00:17:15,525 --> 00:17:17,735
Hey, a laser! How come
you don't have a laser, Woody?

279
00:17:17,945 --> 00:17:20,865
It's not a laser! It's a-
It's a little light bulb that blinks.

280
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:22,533
- What's with him?
- Laser envy.

281
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:24,619
All right, that's enough!

282
00:17:24,828 --> 00:17:27,873
- Look, we're all very impressed
with Andy's new toy.
- Toy?

283
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:30,042
T-O-Y. Toy!

284
00:17:30,251 --> 00:17:34,130
Excuse me, l-l think the word
you're searching for is "Space Ranger."

285
00:17:34,297 --> 00:17:38,468
The word I'm searching for I can't say
because there's preschool toys present.

286
00:17:38,719 --> 00:17:39,970
Gettin' kinda tense,
aren't ya?

287
00:17:40,179 --> 00:17:43,600
Uh, Mr. Lightyear,
uh, now, I'm curious.

288
00:17:43,808 --> 00:17:46,102
What does a Space Ranger
actually do?

289
00:17:46,311 --> 00:17:48,189
He's not a Space Ranger!

290
00:17:48,397 --> 00:17:54,446
- He doesn't fight evil
or, or shoot lasers or fly!
- Excuse me.

291
00:17:54,654 --> 00:17:57,908
- Ooh!
- Oh, impressive wingspan! Very good!

292
00:17:58,074 --> 00:18:02,705
Oh, what? What?
These are plastic. He can't fly!

293
00:18:02,914 --> 00:18:06,335
They are a terillium-carbonic alloy,
and I can fly.

294
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:09,379
- No, you can't.
- Yes, lean.

295
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:11,341
- You can't.
- Can.

296
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:14,969
- Can't. Can't. Can't!
- I tell you, I could fly around
this room with my eyes closed!

297
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:19,391
- Okay, then, Mr. Light Beer, prove it.
- All right, then, I will.

298
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,855
Stand back, everyone!

299
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:33,533
To infinity and beyond!

300
00:18:58,479 --> 00:19:00,565
- Can!
- Whoa!

301
00:19:00,773 --> 00:19:03,986
- Oh, wow, you flew magnificently!

302
00:19:04,236 --> 00:19:08,282
- I found my movin' buddy.
- Thank you. Th-Thank you all. Thank you.

303
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:12,245
That wasn't flying!
That was... falling with style.

304
00:19:12,453 --> 00:19:15,457
Man, the dolls must really
go for you. Can you teach me that?

305
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:19,628
Golly bob howdy!
- Oh, shut up!

306
00:19:19,879 --> 00:19:22,757
You know, in a couple of days,
everything will be just
the way it was. They'll see.

307
00:19:23,008 --> 00:19:24,968
- They'll see.

308
00:19:25,177 --> 00:19:28,431
I'm still Andy's favorite toy.

309
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:31,434
# I was on top of the world
livin' high #

310
00:19:31,642 --> 00:19:35,397
- Whoa!
-# It was right in my pocket #

311
00:19:35,606 --> 00:19:38,025
# I was livin' the life #

312
00:19:38,193 --> 00:19:43,239
# Things were just the way
they should be #

313
00:19:43,406 --> 00:19:45,618
# When from out of the sky
like a bomb #

314
00:19:45,826 --> 00:19:50,332
# Comes some little punk
in a rocket #

315
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:53,668
# Now all of a sudden some
strange things are happening to m

316
00:19:53,835 --> 00:19:57,298
Buzz Lightyear
to the rescue!

317
00:19:57,507 --> 00:20:00,092
# Strange #

318
00:20:00,301 --> 00:20:04,389
# Things are happening to me #

319
00:20:04,598 --> 00:20:07,852

324
00:20:25,122 --> 00:20:29,210
# I had friends
I had lots of friends #

325
00:20:29,418 --> 00:20:32,256
# Now all my friends
are gone #

326
00:20:32,422 --> 00:20:37,846

the best I can #

327
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:41,933

329
00:20:44,562 --> 00:20:46,730
# But not anymore #

330
00:20:46,939 --> 00:20:49,317
# And I've lost the love
of the one #

331
00:20:49,568 --> 00:20:52,153
# Whom I adore #

332
00:20:52,362 --> 00:20:56,742
# Let me tell you 'bout it

333

-# Things #

343
00:21:34,523 --> 00:21:36,733
Finally!

344
00:21:36,941 --> 00:21:39,652
Hey, who's got my hat?

345
00:21:39,861 --> 00:21:42,571
Look, I'm Woody! Howdy, howdy, howdy!

346
00:21:42,779 --> 00:21:45,698
Ah-ha!Ah-ha, ha, ha!
Gimme that!

347
00:21:45,906 --> 00:21:48,617
Say there, Lizard and Stretchy Dog,
let me show you something.

348
00:21:48,825 --> 00:21:52,578
It looks as though I've been
accepted into your culture.

349
00:21:52,786 --> 00:21:55,623
- Your chief, Andy,
inscribed his name on me.
- Wow!

350
00:21:55,831 --> 00:21:58,416
With permanent ink too!

351
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:03,836
Well, I must get back
to repairing my ship.

352
00:22:04,045 --> 00:22:06,130
Don't let it
get to you, Woody.

353
00:22:06,339 --> 00:22:08,840
Uh... let what? I don't, uh-
What do you mean? Who?

354
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:11,675
I know Andy's
excited about Buzz.

355
00:22:11,842 --> 00:22:15,304
But you know he'll always have
a special place for you.

356
00:22:15,511 --> 00:22:19,057
- Yeah, like the attic.
- All right, that's it!

357
00:22:19,265 --> 00:22:22,392
- Hmm. Unidirectional bonding strip.

358
00:22:22,601 --> 00:22:24,894
Mr. Lightyear
wants more tape.

359
00:22:25,102 --> 00:22:26,771
Hmm?

360
00:22:26,979 --> 00:22:30,523
Listen, Light Snack,
you stay away from Andy.

361
00:22:30,732 --> 00:22:34,276
He's mine, and no one
is taking him away from me.

362
00:22:34,485 --> 00:22:39,988
- What are you talking about?
Where's that bonding strip?

363
00:22:40,197 --> 00:22:44,075
And another thing:
Stop with this spaceman thing!

364
00:22:44,283 --> 00:22:47,827
- It's getting on my nerves!
- Are you saying you wanna lodge
a complaint with Star Command?

365
00:22:48,036 --> 00:22:51,914
Oh-ho, okay! Ooh, well, so you wanna
do it the hard way, huh?

366
00:22:52,122 --> 00:23:00,337
- Don't even think about it, cowboy.
- Oh, yeah, tough guy?

367
00:23:05,883 --> 00:23:09,094
The air isn't...toxic.

368
00:23:09,302 --> 00:23:13,055
How dare you open a spaceman's helmet
on an uncharted planet!

369
00:23:13,264 --> 00:23:17,350
My eyeballs could've been
sucked from their sockets!

370
00:23:17,517 --> 00:23:21,603
You actually think
you're the Buzz Lightyear?

371
00:23:21,811 --> 00:23:24,730
Oh, all this time
I thought it was an act!

372
00:23:24,939 --> 00:23:27,941
Hey, guys, look!
It's the real Buzz Lightyear!

373
00:23:28,149 --> 00:23:29,942
You're mocking me,
aren't you?

374
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:33,903
Oh, no, no. No, no, no, no, no.
Buzz, look, an alien!

375
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:37,031
- Where?

376
00:23:41,325 --> 00:23:43,786
Yes!

377
00:23:44,328 --> 00:23:46,830
- Whoa!
- Uh-oh.

378
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:50,040
- It's Sid!
- Don't move!

379
00:23:50,291 --> 00:23:53,501
- I thought he was at summer camp.
- They must've kicked him out
early this year.

380
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:56,004
- Oh, no, not Sid!

381
00:23:56,212 --> 00:23:59,423
- Incoming!

382
00:24:00,257 --> 00:24:03,926
- Who is it this time?
- I--I can't--I can't tell.
Hey, where's Lenny?

383
00:24:04,135 --> 00:24:09,054
- Right here, Woody.
- Oh, no, I can't bear
to watch one of these again.

384
00:24:09,263 --> 00:24:12,182
Oh, no, it's a Combat Carl.

385
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:16,643
- What's going on?
- Nothing that concerns
you spacemen; just us toys.

386
00:24:16,852 --> 00:24:18,645
I'd better
take a look anyway.

387
00:24:18,854 --> 00:24:22,064
- Why is that soldier
strapped to an explosive device?

388
00:24:22,273 --> 00:24:24,566
That's why: Sid.

389
00:24:24,774 --> 00:24:27,694
- Hmm, sure is a hairy fellow.

390
00:24:27,902 --> 00:24:29,904
No, no, that's Scud,
you idiot.

391
00:24:30,112 --> 00:24:32,488
- That is Sid.

392
00:24:32,697 --> 00:24:35,616
- You mean that happy child?
- That ain't no happy child.

393
00:24:35,824 --> 00:24:41,120
He tortures toys,
just for fun!

394
00:24:42,413 --> 00:24:44,789
Well, then we've got
to do something.

395
00:24:44,998 --> 00:24:47,083
What are you doing?
Get down from there!

396
00:24:47,291 --> 00:24:50,127
- I'm gonna teach that boy a lesson.
- Yeah, sure. You go ahead.

397
00:24:50,294 --> 00:24:52,503
- Melt him with your scary laser.

398
00:24:52,712 --> 00:24:55,631
Be careful with that!
It's extremely dangerous.

399
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:58,342
He's lighting it!
He's lighting it! Hit the dirt!

400
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:01,677
- Lookout!

401
00:25:04,304 --> 00:25:07,723
- Yes! He's gone! He's history!

402
00:25:07,932 --> 00:25:11,059
- Whoo!
- I could've stopped him.

403
00:25:11,267 --> 00:25:14,270
Buzz, I would love
to see you try.

404
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:17,314
Of course, I'd love
to see you as a crater.

405
00:25:17,522 --> 00:25:20,650
- The sooner we move, the better.

406
00:25:20,858 --> 00:25:23,485
Yeah!

407
00:25:28,489 --> 00:25:32,659
To infinity and beyond!

408
00:25:32,867 --> 00:25:34,743
All this packing
makes me hungry.

409
00:25:34,952 --> 00:25:38,788
- What would you say to dinner
at, oh, Pizza Planet?
- Pizza Planet? Oh, cool!

410
00:25:38,996 --> 00:25:43,166
Go wash your hands,
and I'll get Molly ready.

411
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:46,085
- Can I bring some toys?
- You can bring one toy.

412
00:25:46,293 --> 00:25:50,672
- Just one?
- One toy?

413
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,590
- Hmm.

414
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:59,220
- Will Andy pick me?

415
00:26:00,596 --> 00:26:04,766
"Don't count on it"?

416
00:26:16,941 --> 00:26:19,443
Mmm!

417
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,489
Buzz! Oh, Buzz!
Buzz Lightyear.

418
00:26:25,698 --> 00:26:28,284
Buzz Lightyear,
thank goodness. We've got trouble!

419
00:26:28,492 --> 00:26:31,119
- Trouble? Where?
- Down there. Just down there.

420
00:26:31,327 --> 00:26:33,829
A helpless toy, it's-
it's trapped, Buzz!

421
00:26:34,037 --> 00:26:38,916
Then we've
no time to lose.

422
00:26:42,586 --> 00:26:45,838
- I don't see anything!
- Oh, he's there!
Just, just keep looking!

423
00:26:46,005 --> 00:26:50,175
- What kind of toy--

424
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:03,435
Oh! Whoa, whoa! Oh!

425
00:27:04,268 --> 00:27:06,687
- Buzz!

426
00:27:06,854 --> 00:27:08,771
Buzz!

427
00:27:08,938 --> 00:27:11,899
I don't see him in the driveway.

428
00:27:12,065 --> 00:27:17,111
- I think he bounced into Sid's yard!
- Oh! Buzz!

429
00:27:17,278 --> 00:27:21,448
Hey, everyone, R.C.'s trying to
say something. What is it, boy?

430
00:27:21,656 --> 00:27:24,909
- He's saying that this was no accident.
- What do you mean?

431
00:27:25,117 --> 00:27:28,578
- I mean Humpty-Dumpty
was pushed... by Woody!
- No!

432
00:27:28,745 --> 00:27:30,747
- What?
- Wait a minute.

433
00:27:30,954 --> 00:27:35,458
You--You don't think I meant
to knock Buzz out the window,
do you? Potato Head?

434
00:27:35,666 --> 00:27:38,461
- That's Mr. Potato Head to you,
you back-stabbing murderer!

435
00:27:38,668 --> 00:27:41,171
Now, it was an accident, guys.
Come on.

436
00:27:41,379 --> 00:27:43,464
Now, you, you
gotta believe me.

437
00:27:43,672 --> 00:27:46,591
We believe ya, Woody.
Right, Rex?

438
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:49,511
Well, yea- N-
I don't like confrontations!

439
00:27:49,719 --> 00:27:53,055
Where is your honor, dirt bag?
You are an absolute disgrace!

440
00:27:53,263 --> 00:27:54,931
You don't deserve to- Hey!

441
00:27:55,139 --> 00:27:58,059
You couldn't handle Buzz cutting
in on your playtime, could you, Woody?

442
00:27:58,266 --> 00:28:02,645
Didn't wanna face the fact that Buzz
just might be Andy's new favorite toy.

443
00:28:02,853 --> 00:28:06,397
So you got rid of him.
Well, what if Andy starts playing
with me more, Woody, huh?

444
00:28:06,606 --> 00:28:08,900
You gonna knock me
outta the window too?

445
00:28:09,108 --> 00:28:12,236
- I don't think we should
give him the chance.
- There he is, men.

446
00:28:12,444 --> 00:28:15,279
- Frag him!
- Let's string him up
by his pull string!

447
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:17,656
- I got dibs on his hat!
- Would you boys stop it!

448
00:28:17,864 --> 00:28:20,575
- Tackle him!
- No, no, no! W-W-Wait!
I can explain everything!

449
00:28:20,784 --> 00:28:23,911
Okay, Mom, be right down.
I've gotta get Buzz.

450
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:27,038
Retreat!

451
00:28:29,331 --> 00:28:32,459
Mom, do you know
where Buzz is?

452
00:28:32,668 --> 00:28:36,003
- No, I haven't seen him.
- Psst!

453
00:28:36,212 --> 00:28:38,421
Andy, I'm heading out the door!

454
00:28:37,738 --> 00:28:41,200
- But, Mom, I can't find him!
- Honey, just grab some other toy.
Now, come on!

455
00:28:41,409 --> 00:28:44,453
Oh, okay.

456
00:28:48,499 --> 00:28:51,753
I couldn't find my Buzz,
know I left him right there.

457
00:28:51,962 --> 00:28:58,593
Honey, I'm sure he's around
You'll find him.

458
00:29:08,103 --> 00:29:11,565
It's too short!
We need more monkeys!

459
00:29:11,773 --> 00:29:14,777
There aren't any more!
That's the whole barrel!

460
00:29:14,986 --> 00:29:18,031
Buzz, the monkeys
aren't working!

461
00:29:18,239 --> 00:29:22,076
We're formulating another plan!
Stay calm!

462
00:29:22,285 --> 00:29:26,664
Oh, where could he be?

463
00:29:36,257 --> 00:29:39,177
- Can I help pump the gas?
- Sure! I'll even let you drive.

464
00:29:39,386 --> 00:29:41,263
- Yeah?
- Yeah, when you're 16.

465
00:29:41,472 --> 00:29:43,432
- Yuk, yuk, yuk! Funny, Mom.

466
00:29:43,641 --> 00:29:50,230
Aw, great. How am I gonna convince
those guys it was an accident?

467
00:29:50,439 --> 00:29:53,025
Buzz!

468
00:29:53,567 --> 00:29:57,446
Buzz! Ha! You're alive!

469
00:29:57,655 --> 00:30:00,866
This is great!
Oh, I'm saved! I'm saved.

470
00:30:01,075 --> 00:30:03,911
Andy'll find you here;
he'll take us back to the room;

471
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:08,667
and then you can tell everyone
that this was all just a big mistake.

472
00:30:08,917 --> 00:30:11,711
Huh? Right?
Buddy?

473
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:15,173
I just want you to know that even
though you tried to terminate me,

474
00:30:15,382 --> 00:30:18,051
revenge is not an idea
we promote on my planet.

475
00:30:18,301 --> 00:30:22,013
- Oh. Well, that's good.
- But we're not on my planet, are we?

476
00:30:22,222 --> 00:30:24,849
- No.

477
00:30:29,855 --> 00:30:32,066
Okay, come on!

478
00:30:32,274 --> 00:30:36,737
You want a piece of me?

479
00:30:39,949 --> 00:30:42,702
- Owww!
- Buzz, Buzz,
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue.

480
00:30:42,868 --> 00:30:44,662
- Aah-ouch!
- Next stop.

481
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:47,581
- Pizza Planet! Yeah!

482
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:50,626
- Andy!

483
00:30:58,969 --> 00:31:02,180
Wh-- Doesn't he realize
that I'm not there?

484
00:31:02,389 --> 00:31:05,434
I'm lost!

485
00:31:05,726 --> 00:31:09,813
Oh, I'm a lost toy!

486
00:31:13,317 --> 00:31:15,527
Buzz Lightyear mission log.

487
00:31:15,736 --> 00:31:18,990
The local sheriff and I seem to be at
a huge refueling station of some sort.

488
00:31:19,198 --> 00:31:21,909
- You!

489
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:43,474
- According to my nava-computer, the-
- Shut up!

490
00:31:43,682 --> 00:31:46,935
- Just shut up, you idiot!
- Sheriff, this is no time to panic.

491
00:31:47,144 --> 00:31:50,481
This is the perfect time to panic.
I'm lost. Andy is gone.

492
00:31:50,648 --> 00:31:52,858
They're gonna move from their house
in two days, and it's all your fault!

493
00:31:53,067 --> 00:31:56,195
My-- My fault? If you hadn't pushed me
out of the window in the first place--

494
00:31:56,403 --> 00:31:58,280
Oh, yeah?
Well, if you...

495
00:31:58,489 --> 00:32:02,451
hadn't shown up in your stupid
little cardboard spaceship
and taken away everything...

496
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,745
- that was important to me-
- Don't talk to me about importance!

497
00:32:04,953 --> 00:32:07,457
Because of you the security
of this entire universe is in jeopardy!

498
00:32:07,666 --> 00:32:09,626
What? What are
you talkin' about?

499
00:32:09,876 --> 00:32:12,671
Right now, poised at
the edge of the galaxy, Emperor Zurg...

500
00:32:12,879 --> 00:32:14,965
has been secretly building
a weapon...

501
00:32:15,173 --> 00:32:17,467
with the destructive capacity
to annihilate an entire planet!

502
00:32:17,676 --> 00:32:21,638
I alone have information that reveals
this weapon's only weakness.

503
00:32:21,846 --> 00:32:24,140
And you, my friend,
are responsible...

504
00:32:24,349 --> 00:32:27,894
for delaying my rendezvous
with Star Command!

505
00:32:28,103 --> 00:32:31,231
You... are... a... toy!

506
00:32:31,439 --> 00:32:33,526
You aren't the real
Buzz Lightyear! You're a-

507
00:32:33,734 --> 00:32:38,322
You're an action figure!
You are a child's plaything!

508
00:32:38,531 --> 00:32:42,994
You are a sad, strange little man;
and you have my pity.

509
00:32:43,244 --> 00:32:47,415
- Farewell.
- Oh, yeah?
Well, good riddance, ya loony!

510
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:50,658
- "Rendezvous with Star Command."

511
00:32:50,867 --> 00:32:53,119
- I Driver] Hey, gas dude!
- You talkin' to me?

512
00:32:53,328 --> 00:32:56,373
- Yeah, man. Can you help me?
- Pizza Planet? Andy!

513
00:32:56,582 --> 00:32:59,585
- Do you know where
Cutting Boulevard is?
- Oh. no!

514
00:32:59,835 --> 00:33:02,713
I can't show my face
in that room without Buzz.

515
00:33:02,963 --> 00:33:05,758
- Buzz! Buzz, come back!
- Go away!

516
00:33:05,966 --> 00:33:09,221
No! Buzz, you gotta
come back! I--

517
00:33:09,429 --> 00:33:13,808
- I found a spaceship!

518
00:33:14,643 --> 00:33:18,480
It's a spaceship, Buzz!

519
00:33:18,688 --> 00:33:22,151
Come on, man, hurry up! Urn, like,
the pizzas are getting cold here!

520
00:33:22,318 --> 00:33:25,655
Uh, Cutting Boulevard, huh?
- Yeah, yeah. Which way?

521
00:33:25,905 --> 00:33:28,783
Now, you're sure this space freighter
will return to its port of origin...

522
00:33:29,033 --> 00:33:31,202
- once it jettisons its food supply?
- Uh-huh.

523
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:35,791
And when we get there, we'll be able
to find a way to transport you home.

524
00:33:35,999 --> 00:33:39,461
- Well, then, let's climb aboard.
- No, no, no, wait, Buzz! Buzz!

525
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:42,339
- Let's get in the back.
No one will see us there.
- Negative.

526
00:33:42,589 --> 00:33:44,883
There are no restraining
harnesses in the cargo area.

527
00:33:45,092 --> 00:33:47,178
- We'll be much safer in the cockpit.
- Yeah, bu-

528
00:33:47,345 --> 00:33:51,015
- Buzz! Buzz!
That's two lefts and a right, huh?

529
00:33:51,224 --> 00:33:54,143
- Thanks for the directions, okay?
- Yeah. And remember, kid-

530
00:33:54,352 --> 00:33:57,188
- Buzz!

531
00:34:08,117 --> 00:34:16,459
It's safer in the cockpit
than the cargo bay. What an idiot.

532
00:34:35,771 --> 00:34:38,149
Next shuttle liftoff is scheduled for...

533
00:34:38,357 --> 00:34:43,989
- T-minus 30 seconds and counting.

534
00:34:44,698 --> 00:34:46,783
You are clear to enter.

535
00:34:46,992 --> 00:34:50,037
Welcome to Pizza Planet.

536
00:34:50,245 --> 00:34:52,457
The white zone is for immediate pizza-

537
00:34:52,665 --> 00:34:54,417
- Sheriff!

538
00:34:54,626 --> 00:34:57,754
There you are.

539
00:34:57,962 --> 00:35:00,548
Now, the entrance is heavily guarded.
We need a way to get inside.

540
00:35:00,798 --> 00:35:03,384
- Great idea, Woody.

541
00:35:03,593 --> 00:35:06,305
I like your thinkin'.

542
00:35:06,513 --> 00:35:08,891
You are clear to enter.

543
00:35:09,141 --> 00:35:11,644
- Welcome to Pizza Planet.
- Now!

544
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:14,230
Quickly, Sheriff!
The air lock is closing.

545
00:35:14,438 --> 00:35:17,483
Jones, party
of five, your shuttle is now boarding-

546
00:35:17,691 --> 00:35:19,569
Hey, Mom, can we have some tokens?

547
00:35:19,778 --> 00:35:21,738
Ow! Watch
where you're going!

548
00:35:21,947 --> 00:35:24,658
Sorry.

549
00:35:29,037 --> 00:35:33,626
... nine, eight, seven, six,

550
00:35:33,834 --> 00:35:38,005
- five, four, three,

551
00:35:39,549 --> 00:35:45,305
What a spaceport!
Good work, Woody.

552
00:35:51,353 --> 00:35:54,273
Mom, can I play Black Hole?
Please, please, please?

553
00:35:54,481 --> 00:35:57,109
- Andy!
- Now, we need to find a ship
that's headed for Sector 12.

554
00:35:57,276 --> 00:35:59,279
Wait a minute.
No, no, no, Buzz! This way.

555
00:35:59,487 --> 00:36:02,824
- There's a special ship.
I just saw it.
- You mean it has hyperdrive?

556
00:36:03,032 --> 00:36:05,326
Hyperactive hyperdrive.

557
00:36:05,535 --> 00:36:08,663
- And Astro, uh, turf!

558
00:36:08,871 --> 00:36:11,500
- Where is it? I-I don't see the-
- Come on. That's it.

559
00:36:11,709 --> 00:36:14,712
Spaceship!

560
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,965
All right, Buzz,
get ready. And-

561
00:36:18,132 --> 00:36:21,802
- And the universe explodes!
- Okay, Buzz, when I say go,
we're gonna jump in the basket.

562
00:36:22,011 --> 00:36:24,639
Buzz!

563
00:36:24,806 --> 00:36:26,725
- No!
Hey, Mom, if I eat all my pizza,

564
00:36:26,892 --> 00:36:35,692
- can I have some alien slime?
- This cannot be happening to me.

565
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:42,867
- A stranger.
- From the outside.

566
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:46,829
- Ooh!
- Greetings. I am Buzz Lightyear.

567
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:53,078
- I come in peace.

568
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,829
Before your
space journey, re-energize yourself...

569
00:36:57,037 --> 00:37:00,996
with a slice of pepperoni,
now boarding at counter three.

570
00:37:01,204 --> 00:37:03,496
This is an intergalactic emergency.

571
00:37:03,705 --> 00:37:06,080
I need to commandeer
your vessel to Sector 12.

572
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:08,706
Who's in charge here?

573
00:37:08,914 --> 00:37:11,957
The claw!

574
00:37:14,124 --> 00:37:17,041
- The claw is our master.
- The claw chooses who
will go and who will stay.

575
00:37:17,249 --> 00:37:20,500
- This is ludicrous.
- Hey, bozo, you got a brain in there?

576
00:37:20,667 --> 00:37:24,042
- Take that!

577
00:37:24,334 --> 00:37:26,918
Oh, no! Sid!

578
00:37:27,167 --> 00:37:30,294
- Get down!

579
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:33,169
- What's gotten into you? I wa-
- You are the one that decided
to climb into this--

580
00:37:33,419 --> 00:37:38,004
Shh! The claw, it moves.

581
00:37:41,004 --> 00:37:43,088
have been chosen!

582
00:37:43,297 --> 00:37:47,047
Farewell, my friends.
I go on to a better place.

583
00:37:47,255 --> 00:37:50,089
Gotcha!

584
00:37:51,298 --> 00:37:56,007
A Buzz Lightyear?
No way!

585
00:38:09,343 --> 00:38:12,051
- Yes!

586
00:38:12,385 --> 00:38:15,094
Buzz! No!

587
00:38:15,261 --> 00:38:17,678
- Hey!

588
00:38:17,886 --> 00:38:20,178
- He has been chosen!

589
00:38:20,387 --> 00:38:22,262
- He must go.
- Hey!

590
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:29,264
- What are you doing? Stop it!
Stop it, you zealots!
- Do not fight the claw.

591
00:38:29,431 --> 00:38:34,140
All right!
Double prizes!

592
00:38:34,973 --> 00:38:39,765
Let's go home and... play.

593
00:38:51,727 --> 00:38:54,060
Sheriff, I can see
your dwelling from here.

594
00:38:54,269 --> 00:38:57,269
- You're almost home.
- Nirvana is coming.
The mystic portal awaits.

595
00:38:57,477 --> 00:39:00,061
Will you be quiet?
You guys don't get it, do you?

596
00:39:00,312 --> 00:39:03,729
Once we go into Sid's house,
we won't be coming out.

597
00:39:03,937 --> 00:39:06,438
- Whoa, Scud! Hey, boy!

598
00:39:06,646 --> 00:39:08,521
- Sit! Good boy.

599
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:11,980
- Hey, I got something for you, boy.
- Freeze!

600
00:39:12,147 --> 00:39:16,148
- Ready, set, now!

601
00:39:17,607 --> 00:39:19,857
Hannah!
Hey, Hannah!

602
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:22,191
- What?
- Did I get my package in the mail?

603
00:39:22,399 --> 00:39:24,649
- I don't know.
- What do you mean you don't know?

604
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:27,066
- I don't know!

605
00:39:27,275 --> 00:39:29,984
- Oh, no, Hannah! Look, Janie!
- What? Hey!

606
00:39:30,193 --> 00:39:32,067
- She's sick!
- No, she's not!

607
00:39:32,276 --> 00:39:35,610
- I'll have to perform
one of my operations.
- No!

608
00:39:35,818 --> 00:39:38,861
- No, not Sid's room. Not there.
- Hey, give it back!

609
00:39:39,069 --> 00:39:41,653
Bid! Bid!

610
00:39:41,861 --> 00:39:45,486
- Oh, no, we have
a sick patient here, Nurse.

611
00:39:45,737 --> 00:39:49,155
- Prepare the O. R., stat!

612
00:39:49,362 --> 00:39:53,030
Patient is... prepped.

613
00:39:53,197 --> 00:39:55,406
No one's ever attempted
a double bypass...

614
00:39:55,614 --> 00:39:57,823
brain transplant before.

615
00:39:57,989 --> 00:40:01,449
Now for the tricky part.
Pliers!

616
00:40:01,657 --> 00:40:04,158
I don't believe that man's
ever been to medical school.

617
00:40:04,365 --> 00:40:08,825
Doctor, you've done it!

618
00:40:09,867 --> 00:40:11,867
Hannah!

619
00:40:12,075 --> 00:40:16,743
- Janie's all better now.

620
00:40:18,452 --> 00:40:23,953
Whatever she says,
it's not true!

621
00:40:33,121 --> 00:40:38,623
We are gonna die.
I'm outta here!

622
00:40:39,998 --> 00:40:42,081
Locked.

623
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:48,750
- There's gotta be
another way outta here.

624
00:40:57,159 --> 00:41:01,825
Uh, Buzz?
W-Was that you?

625
00:41:10,029 --> 00:41:12,029
Hey, hi there,
little fella.

626
00:41:12,237 --> 00:41:18,901
Come out here.
Do you know a way outta here?

627
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:46,808
J-B-B-B-Bu- Buzz!

628
00:41:47,016 --> 00:41:50,889
B-B-B-B-Bu- Buzz!

629
00:41:58,262 --> 00:42:02,427
- They're cannibals.

630
00:42:02,843 --> 00:42:05,218
- Mayday, mayday.

631
00:42:05,467 --> 00:42:07,716
- Come in, Star Command.
Send reinforcements.

632
00:42:07,967 --> 00:42:10,424
Star Command, do you copy?

633
00:42:10,674 --> 00:42:13,048
- I've set my laser from stun to kill.

634
00:42:13,257 --> 00:42:19,088
Aw, great. Great. Yeah, and if anyone
attacks us, we can blink 'em to death.

635
00:42:19,296 --> 00:42:22,753
- Hey, you guys,
I think I found him!

636
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,252
- Buzz, is that you?

637
00:42:25,418 --> 00:42:27,626
Whiskers, will you
get outta here!

638
00:42:27,834 --> 00:42:30,625
- You're interfering
with the search and rescue!

639
00:42:30,875 --> 00:42:34,915
Look, they're home.

640
00:42:38,248 --> 00:42:40,538
Mom, have you seen Woody?

641
00:42:40,746 --> 00:42:43,371
- Where was the last place
you left him?
- Right here in the van.

642
00:42:43,578 --> 00:42:46,786
Oh, I'm sure he's there.
You're just not looking hard enough.

643
00:42:46,994 --> 00:42:48,785
He's not here, Mom.
Woody's gone.

644
00:42:48,952 --> 00:42:51,284
Woody's gone?

645
00:42:51,451 --> 00:42:53,534
Yeah, boy,
the weasel ran away.

646
00:42:53,783 --> 00:42:55,866
Huh? Huh?
I told you he was guilty.

647
00:42:56,074 --> 00:43:00,114
Who would've thought he was capable
of such atrocities?

648
00:43:00,322 --> 00:43:05,112
Oh, Slink,
hope he's okay.

649
00:43:07,403 --> 00:43:14,192
Oh, a survivor.
Where's the rebel base? Talk!

650
00:43:14,609 --> 00:43:18,358
I can see
your will is strong.

651
00:43:18,524 --> 00:43:24,605
Well, we have ways
of making you talk.

652
00:43:31,645 --> 00:43:35,310
Where are your rebel friends now?

653
00:43:35,518 --> 00:43:37,892
Sid, your Pop Tarts are ready!

654
00:43:38,142 --> 00:43:41,265
All right!

655
00:43:51,553 --> 00:43:53,761
Are you all right?
I'm proud of you, Sheriff.

656
00:43:53,928 --> 00:43:56,551
A lesser man would've talked
under such torture.

657
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:59,759
I sure hope
this isn't permanent.

658
00:44:00,009 --> 00:44:02,508
Still no word from Star Command.
We're not that far from the space port.

659
00:44:02,716 --> 00:44:05,507
The door. It's open!
We're free!

660
00:44:05,715 --> 00:44:09,880
- Woody, we don't know what's out there!
- I'll tell you wha-

661
00:44:10,089 --> 00:44:16,836
- They're gonna eat us, Buzz!
Do something quick!
- Shield your eyes.

662
00:44:17,086 --> 00:44:19,460
It's networking. I recharged it
before I left, l-lt should be good for--

663
00:44:19,668 --> 00:44:23,000
You idiot! You're a toy!
Use your karate chop action!

664
00:44:23,209 --> 00:44:26,749
- Get away! Hoo-cha!
- Hey! Hey! How're you
doin' that? Stop that.

665
00:44:26,957 --> 00:44:28,624
Back! Back,
you savages! Back!

666
00:44:28,831 --> 00:44:32,580
- Woody, stop it!
- Sorry, guys, but dinner's canceled!

667
00:44:32,789 --> 00:44:35,829
There's no place like home!
There's no place like home!

668
00:44:36,037 --> 00:44:41,118
- There's no place like home.

669
00:44:52,156 --> 00:44:54,656
Another stunt like that,
cowboy, you're gonna get us killed.

670
00:44:54,864 --> 00:45:00,487
- Don't tell me what to do.
- Shh!

671
00:45:16,106 --> 00:45:19,146
Yee-haw! Giddyap, pardner!

672
00:45:19,313 --> 00:45:25,061
- We got to get this wagon
train a-movin'!

673
00:45:25,269 --> 00:45:28,518
- Split up!

674
00:45:33,391 --> 00:45:35,890
Hmm?

675
00:45:48,594 --> 00:45:51,301
Calling Buzz Lightyear.
Come in, Buzz Lightyear.

676
00:45:51,509 --> 00:45:54,966
- This is Star Command.
Buzz Lightyear, do you read me?
- Star Command!

677
00:45:55,175 --> 00:45:57,549
Buzz Lightyear responding.
Read you loud and clear.

678
00:45:57,758 --> 00:45:59,924
Buzz Lightyear,
planet Earth needs your help.

679
00:46:00,173 --> 00:46:02,339
- On the way!
- Buzz Lightyear!

680
00:46:02,547 --> 00:46:06,504
The world's greatest superhero!
Now the world's greatest toy!

681
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:08,968
Buzz has it all!
Locking wrist communicator!

682
00:46:09,177 --> 00:46:11,801
- Calling Buzz Lightyear!
- Karate chop action!

683
00:46:11,968 --> 00:46:14,509
- Wow!
- Pulsating laser light!

684
00:46:14,676 --> 00:46:17,092
- Total annihilation!
- Multi-phase voice simulator!

685
00:46:17,301 --> 00:46:19,258
There's a secret
mission in uncharted space.

686
00:46:19,508 --> 00:46:22,216
There's
a secret mission in uncharted space.

687
00:46:22,383 --> 00:46:25,008
And best of all,
high pressure space wings!

688
00:46:25,216 --> 00:46:28,133
- To infinity and beyond!
- Not a flying toy.

689
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:30,840
Get your Buzz Lightyear action figure...

690
00:46:31,048 --> 00:46:33,424
- and save a galaxy near you!
- Buzz Lightyear!

691
00:46:33,673 --> 00:46:37,298
Available at all Al's Toy Barn outlets
in the Tri-county area.

692
00:46:37,506 --> 00:46:38,964
And welcome back...

693
00:46:39,173 --> 00:46:44,380
to the Point Richmond
Bowling Championship.

694
00:46:44,589 --> 00:46:48,672
# Out among the stars I sit #

695
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:52,838
# Way beyond the moon #

696
00:46:53,047 --> 00:46:57,504
# In my silver ship I sailed #

697
00:46:57,712 --> 00:47:01,670
# To a dream
that ended too soon #

698
00:47:01,879 --> 00:47:04,503
# Now I know exactly #

699
00:47:04,670 --> 00:47:08,045
-# Who I am and what I'm here for #

700
00:47:08,211 --> 00:47:13,335
You are a toy! You can't fly!

701
00:47:13,669 --> 00:47:18,334
# And I will go sailing #

702
00:47:19,376 --> 00:47:22,626
# No more #

703
00:47:26,251 --> 00:47:30,334
# But no, it can't be true #

704
00:47:30,542 --> 00:47:33,541
# I could fly if I wanted to #

705
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:36,166
# Like a bird in the sky #

706
00:47:36,333 --> 00:47:39,166
# If I believed I could fly #

707
00:47:39,374 --> 00:47:42,291
# Why, I'd fly #

708
00:47:42,498 --> 00:47:46,998
To infinity and beyond!

709
00:48:01,039 --> 00:48:04,704
# - Clearly, I. #

710
00:48:04,912 --> 00:48:08,954
# Will go sailing #

711
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:28,744
- Mom! Mom, have you seen
my Sally doll?

712
00:48:28,951 --> 00:48:32,076
What, dear? What was that?

713
00:48:32,285 --> 00:48:35,534
Never mind!

714
00:48:39,159 --> 00:48:41,450
Oof! Oof!

715
00:48:41,658 --> 00:48:44,366
Buzz, the coast is clear.
Buzz, where are you?

716
00:48:44,575 --> 00:48:48,033
There's a secret
mission, in uncharted space. Let's go.

717
00:48:48,199 --> 00:48:52,073
Really? That is so interesting.

718
00:48:52,282 --> 00:48:55,490
Would you like some tea,
Mrs. Nesbitt?

719
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:59,239
- Buzz!
- It's so nice you could join us
on such late notice.

720
00:48:59,489 --> 00:49:03,323
- Oh. no!
- What a lovely hat, Mrs. Nesbitt.

721
00:49:03,531 --> 00:49:05,739
It goes quite well
with your head

722
00:49:05,906 --> 00:49:08,864
Hannah! Oh, Hannah!

723
00:49:09,031 --> 00:49:11,738
Mom? Please excuse me, ladies.

724
00:49:11,988 --> 00:49:16,030
I'll be right back.

725
00:49:16,863 --> 00:49:20,195
What is it, Mom?
Mom, where are you?

726
00:49:20,404 --> 00:49:23,029
Buzz. Hey.
Buzz, are you okay?

727
00:49:23,195 --> 00:49:26,320
Gone!
It's all gone.

728
00:49:26,570 --> 00:49:29,278
All of it's gone.
Bye-bye. Whoo-whoo. See ya.

729
00:49:29,445 --> 00:49:33,111
- What happened to you?
- One minute you're defending
the whole galaxy.

730
00:49:33,319 --> 00:49:37,693
And suddenly you find
yourself suckin' down Darjeeling with...

731
00:49:37,902 --> 00:49:42,276
Marie Antoinette
and her little sister.

732
00:49:42,484 --> 00:49:44,568
I think you've had
enough tea for today.

733
00:49:44,776 --> 00:49:46,650
Let's get you
outta here, Buzz.

734
00:49:46,859 --> 00:49:49,650
Don't you get it?
You see the hat?

735
00:49:49,901 --> 00:49:57,066
- I am Mrs. Nesbitt! Ha-ha-ha-ha!
- Snap out of it, Buzz!

736
00:49:57,275 --> 00:50:00,524
- I-l-I'm sorry. I-
You're right.

737
00:50:00,691 --> 00:50:02,482
I am just a little depressed.
That's all.

738
00:50:02,690 --> 00:50:05,191
--I can get through this.

739
00:50:05,398 --> 00:50:07,273
- Oh, I'm a sham!
- Shh!

740
00:50:07,481 --> 00:50:08,939
- Look at me.
- Quiet, Buzz.

741
00:50:09,148 --> 00:50:11,523
I can't even
fly out of a window.

742
00:50:11,772 --> 00:50:16,023
The hat look good?
Tell me the hat look good.

743
00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:20,189
- The apron is a bit much.
-"Out the window"!
Buzz, you're a genius!

744
00:50:20,397 --> 00:50:22,272
- Come on, come on. This way.

745
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:25,396
Years of academy,
training, wasted!

746
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:27,480
Ha, ha. B-3.

747
00:50:27,688 --> 00:50:29,480
- Miss! G-6.
- Oh!

748
00:50:29,687 --> 00:50:31,937
- You sunk it. Are you peeking?
- Heh, heh!

749
00:50:32,187 --> 00:50:35,312
Oh, quit your whinin' and pay up.
No, no, not the ear.

750
00:50:35,479 --> 00:50:37,811
- Give me the nose. Come on.
- How about three out of five?

751
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:42,269
Hey, guys! Guys! Hey!

752
00:50:43,102 --> 00:50:45,186
- Son of a building block. It's Woody.
- He's in the psycho's bedroom.

753
00:50:45,394 --> 00:50:48,518
- Ha, ha! Hi!
- Everyone! It's Woody!

754
00:50:48,727 --> 00:50:50,185
- Woody?
- You're kidding!
- Woody?

755
00:50:50,393 --> 00:50:52,768
Ha! We're gonna
get outta here, Buzz.

756
00:50:53,018 --> 00:50:55,601
Buzz?

757
00:50:59,684 --> 00:51:01,350
- Hey, look!
- Woody!

758
00:51:01,517 --> 00:51:03,184
Oh, boy, am I glad
to see you guys.

759
00:51:03,434 --> 00:51:05,933
- I knew you'd come back, Woody.
- What are you doin' over there?

760
00:51:06,141 --> 00:51:08,391
It's a long story, Bo.
I'll explain later.

761
00:51:08,641 --> 00:51:10,391
Here! Catch this!

762
00:51:10,599 --> 00:51:11,515
Ha!

763
00:51:11,766 --> 00:51:14,016
- Whoa! I've got it, Woody.
- He got it, Woody.

764
00:51:14,265 --> 00:51:17,056
Good goin', Slick. Now just,
just tie it on to somethin'.

765
00:51:17,265 --> 00:51:19,973
- Wait, wait, wait, wait. I got
a better idea. How 'bout we don't?
- Hey!

766
00:51:20,182 --> 00:51:22,890
- Potato Head.
- Did you all take
stupid pills this morning?

767
00:51:23,098 --> 00:51:24,890
Have you forgotten
what he did to Buzz?

768
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:26,972
And now you wanna let him
back over here?

769
00:51:27,139 --> 00:51:31,305
No! No, no, no, no, no! You got it-
You got it all wrong, Potato Head.

770
00:51:31,555 --> 00:51:33,638
Buzz is fine. Buzz is right here.
He's with me!

771
00:51:33,805 --> 00:51:37,055
- You are a liar!
- No, I'm not. Buzz, come over here.

772
00:51:37,263 --> 00:51:41,637
Tell the nice boys that you're-
that you're not dead.

773
00:51:41,846 --> 00:51:44,845
Just a sec!

774
00:51:45,095 --> 00:51:48,928
Buzz, will you get up here
and give me a hand?

775
00:51:50,896 --> 00:51:53,601
That's very funny, Buzz.

776
00:51:53,809 --> 00:51:56,223
- This is serious!
- Hey, Woody! Where'd ya go?

777
00:51:56,388 --> 00:51:58,178
He's lying. Buzz ain't there.

778
00:51:58,386 --> 00:52:01,507
Oh! Hi, Buzz!

779
00:52:01,715 --> 00:52:04,711
Why don't you say hello
to the guys over there?

780
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:08,081
Hiya, fellas! To infinity and beyond!

781
00:52:08,290 --> 00:52:09,913
Hey, look!
It's Buzz!

782
00:52:10,162 --> 00:52:14,531
Hey, Buzz, let's show the guys
our new secret best friends handshake.

783
00:52:14,698 --> 00:52:16,488
Give me five, man!

784
00:52:16,695 --> 00:52:18,359
Something's screwy here.

785
00:52:18,568 --> 00:52:21,065
So you see we're friends now, guys.
Aren't we, Buzz?

786
00:52:21,273 --> 00:52:23,020
You bet. Give me a hug.

787
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:25,434
Ho-ho! Boy, I love you too.

788
00:52:25,641 --> 00:52:27,431
See? It is Buzz.

789
00:52:27,598 --> 00:52:30,136
- Now give back the lights, Potato Head.
- Wait just a minute.

790
00:52:30,303 --> 00:52:36,669
- What are you tryin' to pull?
- Nothing!

791
00:52:37,210 --> 00:52:38,957
- Oh, that is disgusting.
- Murderer!

792
00:52:39,166 --> 00:52:41,371
- No! No, no, no, no, no!
- You murdering dog!

793
00:52:41,579 --> 00:52:43,951
- It's not what you think. I swear!
- Save it for the jury.

794
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:46,032
I hope Sid pulls
your voice box out, ya creep.

795
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:48,528
No, no! No, no!
Don't leave! Don't leave!

796
00:52:46,827 --> 00:52:49,119
Ya gotta help us, please! You don't
know what it's like over here!

797
00:52:49,327 --> 00:52:51,202
Come on.
Let's get outta here.

798
00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:53,701
Go back to your lives, citizens.
Show's over.

799
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:55,868
Come back! Slink!

800
00:52:56,119 --> 00:53:00,285
Slink! Please!
Please! Listen to me!

801
00:53:00,494 --> 00:53:03,411
No! No! Come back!

802
00:53:03,619 --> 00:53:06,411
Slinky!

803
00:53:14,869 --> 00:53:17,453
Buzz! Go away!

804
00:53:17,661 --> 00:53:20,453
You disgusting freaks!
Aaah!

805
00:53:20,702 --> 00:53:27,245
All right, back!
Back, you cannibals! Aah! Oof!

806
00:53:27,453 --> 00:53:31,286
He is still alive, and you're
not gonna get him, you monsters!

807
00:53:31,537 --> 00:53:35,578
What are you doin'?

808
00:53:35,787 --> 00:53:40,495
Hey. Hey, they fixed you.

809
00:53:41,287 --> 00:53:43,287
But-- But they're cannibals.

810
00:53:43,495 --> 00:53:48,995
We saw them eat
those other toys.

811
00:53:54,121 --> 00:53:56,538
Uh, sorry, l-l-l thought
that you were gonna--

812
00:53:56,746 --> 00:53:59,121
You know, you know, eat my friend.

813
00:53:59,329 --> 00:54:01,204
Hey, no, no, wait, hey!

814
00:54:01,413 --> 00:54:03,080
- What's wrong?
- Sid?

815
00:54:03,946 --> 00:54:05,196
Not now, Mom! I'm busy!

816
00:54:05,404 --> 00:54:08,111
- Sid! Buzz, come on!
- You left that door open.

817
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:14,150
Get up! Use your legs! Fine!
Let Sid trash you, but don't blame me!

818
00:54:14,359 --> 00:54:17,482
It came!
It finally came!

819
00:54:17,690 --> 00:54:20,481
Ha, ha!

820
00:54:20,897 --> 00:54:24,479
"The Big One."

821
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:27,894
"Extremely dangerous.

822
00:54:28,102 --> 00:54:32,184
Keep out of reach of children."

823
00:54:32,351 --> 00:54:35,807
Cool!
What am I gonna blow?

824
00:54:36,015 --> 00:54:42,346
Man. Hey, where's
that wimpy cowboy doll?

825
00:54:52,758 --> 00:55:00,379
Yes. I've always wanted
to put a spaceman into orbit.

826
00:55:04,628 --> 00:55:06,293
- Heh, heh.

827
00:55:06,543 --> 00:55:09,541
Now. Yes.

828
00:55:13,498 --> 00:55:16,538
- Oh, no!

829
00:55:18,913 --> 00:55:21,827
Oh, man!

830
00:55:26,492 --> 00:55:28,283
Sid Phillips reporting.

831
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:30,574
Launch of the shuttle
has been delayed...

832
00:55:30,781 --> 00:55:33,364
due to adverse weather
conditions at the launch site.

833
00:55:33,614 --> 00:55:36,613
Tomorrow's forecast: sunny.

834
00:55:37,790 --> 00:55:41,244
Sweet dreams.

835
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:49,442
I looked everywhere, honey,
but all I could find was your hat.

836
00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:51,523
But what if we
leave them behind?

837
00:55:51,731 --> 00:56:02,552
Oh, don't worry, honey.
I'm sure we'll find Woody
and Buzz before we leave tomorrow.

838
00:56:04,341 --> 00:56:06,089
I need air!

839
00:56:06,296 --> 00:56:08,502
Why will you quit
movin' around?

840
00:56:08,669 --> 00:56:12,331
I'm sorry. It's just that I get-
I get so nervous before I travel.

841
00:56:12,539 --> 00:56:14,828
How did I get stuck
with you as a moving buddy?

842
00:56:15,036 --> 00:56:19,738
Everyone else was picked.

843
00:56:22,859 --> 00:56:24,607
Oh, Woody.

844
00:56:24,816 --> 00:56:31,807
If only you could see
how much Andy misses you.

845
00:56:42,293 --> 00:56:46,663
Psst. Psst! Hey, Buzz!

846
00:56:50,201 --> 00:56:52,614
Hey.

847
00:56:52,781 --> 00:56:57,816
Get over here and see if
you can get this toolbox off me.

848
00:56:57,982 --> 00:57:01,437
Oh, come on, Buzz, I--

849
00:57:01,644 --> 00:57:05,806
Buzz, I can't do this without you.
I need your help.

850
00:57:06,014 --> 00:57:10,301
I can't help.
I can't help anyone.

851
00:57:10,467 --> 00:57:13,588
Why, sure you can, Buzz.
You can get me outta here.

852
00:57:13,838 --> 00:57:16,627
Then I'll get that rocket off you,
and we'll make a break for Andy's house.

853
00:57:13,796 --> 00:57:16,925
Andy's house, Sid's house.
What's the difference?

854
00:57:17,134 --> 00:57:21,307
Oh, Buzz. You've had a big fall.
You must not be thinking clearly.

855
00:57:21,515 --> 00:57:24,645
No, Woody. For the first time
I am thinking clearly.

856
00:57:24,854 --> 00:57:28,400
You were right all along.
I'm not a Space Ranger.

857
00:57:28,609 --> 00:57:32,281
I'm just a toy, a stupid,
little, insignificant toy.

858
00:57:32,448 --> 00:57:34,242
Whoa, hey, wait a minute.

859
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:37,079
Bein' a toy is a lot better
than bein' a, a Space Ranger.

860
00:57:37,246 --> 00:57:39,166
- Yeah, right.
- No, it is.

861
00:57:39,333 --> 00:57:42,170
Look, over in that house is a kid
who thinks you are the greatest.

862
00:57:42,378 --> 00:57:45,424
And it's not because
you're a Space Ranger, pal.

863
00:57:45,591 --> 00:57:49,263
It's because you're a toy.
You are his toy.

864
00:57:49,472 --> 00:57:51,475
But why would Andy want me?

865
00:57:51,683 --> 00:57:55,940
Why would Andy want you? Look at you!
You're a Buzz Lightyear.

866
00:57:56,148 --> 00:57:59,069
Any other toy would give up
his moving parts just to be you.

867
00:57:59,277 --> 00:58:02,824
You've got wings.
You glow in the dark. You talk!

868
00:58:03,033 --> 00:58:06,287
Your helmet does
that, that, that whoosh thing.

869
00:58:06,454 --> 00:58:10,543
You are a cool toy.

870
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:16,319
As a matter of fact,
you're too cool.

871
00:58:16,527 --> 00:58:19,573
mean, I mean, what chance
does a toy like me have...

872
00:58:19,781 --> 00:58:22,912
against a Buzz Lightyear
action figure?

873
00:58:23,078 --> 00:58:25,582
All I can do is--

874
00:58:25,832 --> 00:58:30,088
There's a snake in my boots.

875
00:58:30,297 --> 00:58:32,175
Why would Andy ever want
to play with me...

876
00:58:32,383 --> 00:58:35,222
when he's got you?

877
00:58:35,430 --> 00:58:42,815
I'm the one that should be
strapped to that rocket.

878
00:59:02,553 --> 00:59:05,767
Listen, Buzz,
forget about me.

879
00:59:05,976 --> 00:59:12,235
You should get outta here
while you can.

880
00:59:19,537 --> 00:59:21,832
Buzz? What are you doin'?
I thought you were--

881
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:24,962
Come on, Sheriff. There's a kid
over in that house who needs us.

882
00:59:25,170 --> 00:59:26,965
Now let's get you out of this thing.

883
00:59:27,132 --> 00:59:29,218
Yes, sir!

884
00:59:29,468 --> 00:59:34,685
- Come on, Buzz. We can do it.

885
00:59:38,941 --> 00:59:40,819
Woody, it's the moving van.

886
00:59:41,028 --> 00:59:46,035
We gotta get outta here now.

887
00:59:47,996 --> 00:59:51,460
Come on, Buzz.

888
00:59:51,668 --> 00:59:54,255
All right.
Buzz!

889
00:59:54,582 --> 00:59:59,881
- Hey, I'm out!
- Almost there.

890
01:00:01,134 --> 01:00:04,680
I want to ride the pony.

891
01:00:04,888 --> 01:00:08,227
Phew. Woody?

892
01:00:09,186 --> 01:00:12,607
Woody? Are you all right?

893
01:00:12,816 --> 01:00:16,864
I'm fine. I'm okay.

894
01:00:26,169 --> 01:00:31,718
Oh, yeah!
Time for liftoff! Whoo!

895
01:00:32,344 --> 01:00:36,808
To infinity and beyond!

896
01:00:44,110 --> 01:00:46,822
- Aah! Back, back.

897
01:00:47,031 --> 01:00:49,117
- Down, down!

898
01:00:49,326 --> 01:00:54,541
- Okay, what do I do?
Come on, Woody. Think.

899
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:57,045
Guys!

900
01:00:57,253 --> 01:00:59,883
No, no, no, no! Wait!
Wait. Listen, please.

901
01:01:00,050 --> 01:01:04,055
There's a good toy down there, and he's
gonna be blown to bits in a few minutes.

902
01:01:04,222 --> 01:01:07,602
All because of me.
We've gotta save him.

903
01:01:07,811 --> 01:01:12,901
And, uh-
Bull need your help.

904
01:01:17,616 --> 01:01:21,955
Please. He's my friend.

905
01:01:22,206 --> 01:01:27,505
And he's the only one
I've got.

906
01:01:36,392 --> 01:01:40,857
Thank you.
Okay, I think I know what to do.

907
01:01:41,065 --> 01:01:43,360
We're gonna have
to break a few rules.

908
01:01:43,524 --> 01:01:49,574
But if it works,
it'll help everybody.

909
01:01:56,251 --> 01:02:00,090
- Houston to Mission Control.
Come in, Control.

910
01:02:00,340 --> 01:02:04,805
Launch pad is
being constructed.

911
01:02:05,014 --> 01:02:06,348
All right, listen up.

912
01:02:06,599 --> 01:02:09,311
need Pump Boy here,
Ducky here.

913
01:02:09,478 --> 01:02:13,151
- Legs, you're with Ducky.

914
01:02:13,359 --> 01:02:15,446
Roller Bob and I don't move
till we get the signal. Clear?

915
01:02:15,654 --> 01:02:19,744
- Okay. Let's move!

916
01:02:39,564 --> 01:02:43,110
Wind the frog.

917
01:03:03,557 --> 01:03:07,897
- Wait for the signal.

918
01:03:19,914 --> 01:03:22,501
- Go!

919
01:03:24,421 --> 01:03:27,843
- All right, let's go!

920
01:03:28,051 --> 01:03:29,929
I'll get it!

921
01:03:30,138 --> 01:03:32,307
Now!

922
01:03:32,558 --> 01:03:37,231
- I'm coming. I'm coming.

923
01:03:43,282 --> 01:03:46,119
- Scud!

924
01:03:48,831 --> 01:03:52,253
- Stupid dog.

925
01:03:57,260 --> 01:04:00,390
Lean back!

926
01:04:04,353 --> 01:04:09,278
Uh, Mission Control, is
the launch pad construction complete?

927
01:04:08,669 --> 01:04:11,175
Uh, roger. Rocket is now
secured to guide wire.

928
01:04:11,426 --> 01:04:14,434
We are currently obtaining
the ignition sticks.

929
01:04:14,642 --> 01:04:18,402
- Countdown will commence
momentarily. Standby.
- Let's go.

930
01:04:18,610 --> 01:04:22,913
Hey, Ma! Where are the matches?
Oh, wait. Here they are. Never mind

931
01:04:23,122 --> 01:04:25,503
- Woody! Great!
Help me outta this thing.
- Shh!

932
01:04:25,712 --> 01:04:28,009
- What?
- It's okay.

933
01:04:28,218 --> 01:04:30,725
Everything's under control.

934
01:04:30,933 --> 01:04:32,938
- Woody, what are you doing?
- Houston.

935
01:04:33,105 --> 01:04:37,408
All systems are go.
Requesting permission to launch--

936
01:04:37,617 --> 01:04:41,585
Hey? How'd you get out here?

937
01:04:41,794 --> 01:04:47,851
Oh, well. You and I
can have a cookout later.

938
01:04:48,060 --> 01:04:50,692
Houston, do we have
permission to launch?

939
01:04:50,858 --> 01:04:52,863
Uh, roger. Permission granted.

940
01:04:53,073 --> 01:04:57,668
You are confirmed
at "T" minus ten seconds.

941
01:04:57,876 --> 01:05:01,427
And counting.
Ten, nine,

942
01:05:01,636 --> 01:05:04,142
eight, seven, six,

943
01:05:04,351 --> 01:05:07,150
five, four, three, two,

944
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:11,870
- one!
Reach for the sky!

945
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:15,504
- Huh?
- This town ain't big enough
for the two of us.

946
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:21,202
- What?
- Somebody's poisoned the water hole.

947
01:05:21,411 --> 01:05:24,751
- It's busted.
- Who are you callin' busted, buster?

948
01:05:24,959 --> 01:05:26,837
- That's right.

949
01:05:27,046 --> 01:05:31,011
- I'm talking to you, Sid Phillips.

950
01:05:31,219 --> 01:05:36,646
- We don't like bein' blown up,
Sid, or smashed or ripped apart.
-"We"?

951
01:05:36,854 --> 01:05:39,149
That's right!
Your toys!

952
01:05:39,358 --> 01:05:41,445
Mama!

953
01:05:41,654 --> 01:05:43,740
Mama!

954
01:05:43,948 --> 01:05:47,205
Mama! Mama!

955
01:06:03,565 --> 01:06:05,652
Aaah!

956
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:07,613
Aaah!

957
01:06:07,863 --> 01:06:10,159
- Mama!

958
01:06:10,326 --> 01:06:15,669
From now on, you must take
good care of your toys!

959
01:06:15,877 --> 01:06:19,968
Because if you don't,
we'll find out, Sid.

960
01:06:20,135 --> 01:06:25,059
We toys can see
everything.

961
01:06:27,271 --> 01:06:29,525
So play nice.

962
01:06:29,775 --> 01:06:32,363
Aaah!

963
01:06:35,368 --> 01:06:39,542
Ha-ha! We did it!
We did it! Ha-ha! Yes!

964
01:06:39,792 --> 01:06:42,380
The toys!
The toys are alive!

965
01:06:42,657 --> 01:06:46,413
N-Nice toy.
Aaah!

966
01:06:46,621 --> 01:06:49,543
- What's wrong, Sid?

967
01:06:49,751 --> 01:06:52,380
- Don't you want to play with Sally?

968
01:06:52,547 --> 01:06:55,093
Nice work, fellows.
Good job.

969
01:06:55,260 --> 01:06:58,306
Comin' out of the ground, what a touch.
That was a stroke of genius.

970
01:06:58,515 --> 01:07:01,144
Woody.

971
01:07:01,352 --> 01:07:04,357
- Thanks.

972
01:07:04,774 --> 01:07:06,652
Everybody say, "Bye, house!"

973
01:07:06,861 --> 01:07:11,785
- Woody! The van!
- Bye, house.

974
01:07:11,952 --> 01:07:16,877
- We gotta run! Thanks, guys!

975
01:07:17,085 --> 01:07:20,007
- Quick!

976
01:07:23,136 --> 01:07:27,602
Just go.
I'll catch up.

977
01:07:40,038 --> 01:07:42,625
Aaah!

978
01:07:46,631 --> 01:07:49,511
Come on!

979
01:08:02,781 --> 01:08:04,534
- You can do it, Woody!

980
01:08:04,784 --> 01:08:09,166
I got it! Woo-hoo-hoo!

981
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:13,339
- I made it.

982
01:08:14,257 --> 01:08:18,722
Aaah! Get away,
you stupid dog! Down!

983
01:08:18,973 --> 01:08:21,476
- Down! Aah! Aah!
- Hold on, Woody!

984
01:08:21,685 --> 01:08:25,232
I can't do it.

985
01:08:25,942 --> 01:08:28,445
- Take care of Andy for me!

986
01:08:28,654 --> 01:08:31,159
- No!

987
01:08:31,367 --> 01:08:34,204
- Buzz!

988
01:08:59,410 --> 01:09:02,165
- Ow!
- Are we there already?
- Woody?

989
01:09:02,373 --> 01:09:03,500
- How did you-
- How'd he get here?

990
01:09:03,709 --> 01:09:04,877
- Where have you-
- What happened?

991
01:09:05,044 --> 01:09:06,338
- Ow!
- What's goin' on?

992
01:09:06,546 --> 01:09:10,511
- What's he takin'?
- Aha! There you are!

993
01:09:10,719 --> 01:09:14,350
- Hey. What's he doing?

994
01:09:14,559 --> 01:09:19,358
- Aah!
- He's at it again!

995
01:09:25,409 --> 01:09:28,455
Ha, ha, ha!

996
01:09:28,622 --> 01:09:32,921
- Get him!
- Come on!

997
01:09:37,386 --> 01:09:41,267
- Ah, ah, no, no!

998
01:09:43,353 --> 01:09:46,608
- No, no, no, no! Wait!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

999
01:09:46,775 --> 01:09:49,905
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1000
01:09:50,155 --> 01:09:54,955
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1001
01:09:55,122 --> 01:09:58,377
- Pig pile!

1002
01:10:07,766 --> 01:10:10,353
Aaah!

1003
01:10:18,950 --> 01:10:21,037
- Get outta that car!
- Move it!

1004
01:10:21,204 --> 01:10:23,207
Whew.

1005
01:10:23,415 --> 01:10:25,293
No! Please!
You don't understand!

1006
01:10:25,502 --> 01:10:27,380
Buzz is out there.
We gotta help him.

1007
01:10:27,589 --> 01:10:29,800
- No!
- Toss him overboard!

1008
01:10:30,009 --> 01:10:33,973
No, no, no!
Wait! Aah!

1009
01:10:34,182 --> 01:10:38,021
- Hooray!
- So long, Woody!

1010
01:10:38,231 --> 01:10:40,734
Aah!

1011
01:10:41,485 --> 01:10:44,156
Oh! Woody!

1012
01:10:44,406 --> 01:10:46,701
- Oh! Well, thanks for the ride.
- Lookout!

1013
01:10:46,868 --> 01:10:49,498
Aaah!

1014
01:10:51,292 --> 01:10:57,009
- Now let's catch up to that truck.

1015
01:10:59,721 --> 01:11:03,477
Guys! Guys! Woody's riding R.C.

1016
01:11:03,687 --> 01:11:08,902
- What?
- And Buzz is with him!

1017
01:11:09,112 --> 01:11:12,867
- It is Buzz!
Woody was telling the truth.

1018
01:11:13,076 --> 01:11:16,080
- What have we done?
- Great! Now I have guilt.

1019
01:11:16,290 --> 01:11:19,544
We're almost there!

1020
01:11:19,752 --> 01:11:23,508
Rocky, the ramp!

1021
01:11:29,268 --> 01:11:32,188
Lookout!

1022
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:37,155
Quick! Hold onto my tail!

1023
01:11:39,700 --> 01:11:44,583
- Attaboy, Slink!
- Oh! Woody!

1024
01:11:44,791 --> 01:11:45,960
Woody! Speed up!

1025
01:11:46,169 --> 01:11:48,255
- Speed up!
- The batteries!

1026
01:11:48,422 --> 01:11:49,799
They're runnin' out!

1027
01:11:50,008 --> 01:11:52,930
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1028
01:11:53,138 --> 01:11:56,268
Whoa! Aah!

1029
01:11:56,685 --> 01:12:00,650
# Hakuna Matata
What a wonderful phrase

1030
01:12:00,858 --> 01:12:03,696
- Aaah!

1031
01:12:06,492 --> 01:12:10,247
- I can't hold on much longer.
- Slink! Hang on!

1032
01:12:10,456 --> 01:12:14,128
- Aaah!
- Ouch!

1033
01:12:25,689 --> 01:12:28,401
Great!

1034
01:12:28,734 --> 01:12:30,905
Woody! The rocket!

1035
01:12:31,114 --> 01:12:34,159
The match! Yes!

1036
01:12:34,326 --> 01:12:37,999
Thank you, Sid!

1037
01:12:43,633 --> 01:12:45,803
No! No, no! No!

1038
01:12:46,012 --> 01:12:48,932
No! Oh, no!

1039
01:12:49,142 --> 01:12:52,521
No, no, no, no, no,

1040
01:12:52,731 --> 01:12:54,609
no!

1041
01:12:54,817 --> 01:12:57,195
No!

1042
01:13:05,542 --> 01:13:09,798
- Woody! What are you doing?
- Hold still, Buzz!

1043
01:13:10,007 --> 01:13:12,552
- Ha-ha! Ha-ha!
- You did it!

1044
01:13:12,762 --> 01:13:14,848
Next stop: Andy!

1045
01:13:15,015 --> 01:13:22,526
Wait a minute. I just lit a rocket.
Rockets explode!

1046
01:13:29,037 --> 01:13:32,166
I should have
held on longer.

1047
01:13:32,375 --> 01:13:35,713
Look! Look! It's Woody
and Buzz comin' up fast!

1048
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:38,635
Woody!

1049
01:13:45,729 --> 01:13:49,443
Aah! Take cover!

1050
01:13:54,785 --> 01:13:57,288
Aaah! This is the part
where we blow up!

1051
01:13:57,497 --> 01:14:00,627
Not today!

1052
01:14:05,217 --> 01:14:07,847
Aaah!

1053
01:14:10,642 --> 01:14:12,855
Hey, Buzz!
You're flyin'!

1054
01:14:13,063 --> 01:14:16,067
This isn't flying.
This is falling with style.

1055
01:14:16,277 --> 01:14:18,363
Ha-ha-ha!

1056
01:14:18,572 --> 01:14:23,037
To infinity and beyond!

1057
01:14:28,378 --> 01:14:31,300
Uh, Buzz,
we missed the truck.

1058
01:14:31,508 --> 01:14:36,850
We're not aiming
for the truck.

1059
01:14:39,228 --> 01:14:41,231
Hey, wow!

1060
01:14:41,094 --> 01:14:43,355
- What? What is it?
- Woody! Buzz!

1061
01:14:43,565 --> 01:14:46,622
- Oh, great, you found them.
Where were they?
- Here in the car!

1062
01:14:46,832 --> 01:14:54,580
See? Now, what'd I tell you?
Right where you left 'em.

1063
01:14:59,816 --> 01:15:07,898
- Which one can I open first?
- Let's let Molly open one.

1064
01:15:09,029 --> 01:15:10,705
Frankincense, this is Myrrh.

1065
01:15:10,914 --> 01:15:15,228
- Hey, heads up, everybody.
It's show time.
- Whoa! It's time!

1066
01:15:15,438 --> 01:15:18,453
Ohh! Oh, Bo.

1067
01:15:18,662 --> 01:15:20,882
There's got to be a less painful way
to get my attention.

1068
01:15:21,050 --> 01:15:24,107
Merry Christmas,
Sheriff.

1069
01:15:24,317 --> 01:15:26,746
- Say, isn't that mistletoe?
- Mm-hmm.

1070
01:15:26,956 --> 01:15:29,259
- Ooh!
- I Kissing Sounds, Bo Giggles]

1071
01:15:29,426 --> 01:15:31,646
Maybe Andy will get
another dinosaur.

1072
01:15:31,855 --> 01:15:36,253
Like a leaf eater. That way
I could play the, uh, dominant predator.

1073
01:15:36,462 --> 01:15:38,347
Quiet, everyone!
Quiet!

1074
01:15:38,557 --> 01:15:40,651
Molly's first
present is Mrs. Potato Head.

1075
01:15:40,860 --> 01:15:43,498
Repeat: a Mrs. Potato Head.

1076
01:15:43,708 --> 01:15:45,886
Way to go, Idaho!

1077
01:15:46,095 --> 01:15:50,493
Gee, I'd better shave.

1078
01:15:51,414 --> 01:15:53,718
- Come in, Frankincense.

1079
01:15:53,970 --> 01:15:55,603
Andy is now opening
his first present.

1080
01:15:55,813 --> 01:15:58,576
- It's-
- Buzz. Buzz Lightyear,

1081
01:15:58,744 --> 01:16:00,671
- I can't quite-
- you are not worried, are you?

1082
01:16:00,838 --> 01:16:02,764
- Me? No, no. Pfft.
- Make out-

1083
01:16:02,932 --> 01:16:05,152
No. No, no, no, no. Mm-mm.

1084
01:16:05,361 --> 01:16:07,329
A large box- It's- It's- It's-

1085
01:16:07,581 --> 01:16:09,968
- Are you?
- Now, Buzz,

1086
01:16:10,178 --> 01:16:14,659
what could Andy possibly get
that is worse than you?

1087
01:16:14,911 --> 01:16:16,879
Oh, what is it? What is it?

1088
01:16:17,089 --> 01:16:20,732
- Wow! A puppy!

1089
01:16:30,072 --> 01:16:34,050
# Ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo #

1090
01:16:34,260 --> 01:16:38,658
# You've got a friend in me #

1091
01:16:38,868 --> 01:16:43,056
# You've got a friend in me #

1092
01:16:43,265 --> 01:16:46,323
# When the road looks rough ahead #

1093
01:16:46,532 --> 01:16:51,306
# And you're miles and miles
from your nice, warm bed #

1094
01:16:51,558 --> 01:16:54,908
# You just remember
what your old pal said #

1095
01:16:55,118 --> 01:16:58,971
# Boy, you've got as friend in me #

1096
01:16:59,180 --> 01:17:04,919
# Yeah, you've got a friend in me #

1097
01:17:08,311 --> 01:17:12,374
# You've got a friend in me #

1098
01:17:12,583 --> 01:17:16,561
# You've got a friend in me #

1099
01:17:16,771 --> 01:17:20,750
-# You got troubles #
-# And I got 'em too #

1100
01:17:20,959 --> 01:17:24,938
# There isn't anything
I wouldn't do for you #

1101
01:17:25,148 --> 01:17:27,954
# If we stick together
we can see it through #

1102
01:17:28,205 --> 01:17:33,189
# 'Cause you've got a friend in me #

1103
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:37,503
# You've got a friend in me #

1104
01:17:37,712 --> 01:17:41,691
# Some other folks might be
a little bit smarter than I am #

1105
01:17:41,901 --> 01:17:46,801
# Bigger and stronger too #

1106
01:17:47,136 --> 01:17:51,659
# But none of them will ever
love you the way I do #

1107
01:17:51,827 --> 01:17:54,256
# It's me and you, boy #

1108
01:17:54,466 --> 01:17:57,816
# And as the years go by #

1109
01:17:58,026 --> 01:18:02,507
# Our friendship will never dies #

1110
01:18:02,758 --> 01:18:07,533
# You're gonna see it's our destiny #

1111
01:18:07,742 --> 01:18:11,427
# You've got a friend in me #

1112
01:18:11,637 --> 01:18:15,741
# You've got a friend in me #

1113
01:18:15,909 --> 01:18:21,060
# You've got a friend in me #
