You don't
know anything.

called the Police.

were all cut up,

She wasn't wearing
any clothes.

Why would
her clothes
be cut up?

that it was part
of his foreplay.

And then,
when they looked
into his records,

00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:28,465

that he'd been caught

why he did it,

feel better.

You know, he'd get

or something,

up things.

No.

Why did he kill
the women?

you could--

peel off the top layer
of their eyeball

139

so you could have

they saw.

00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,534
Maybe.

164
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:50,735
Maybe what?

165
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:58,475
Maybe you
should tie me up.

166
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,609
Or maybe
you should
just hold still.

167
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,483
Okay.

168
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:19,329
You want to get
in the back seat
with me?

169
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:25,803
Why not?

170
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:06,646
What's that for?

171
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:09,380
I don't know.

172
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:29,272
Is this
what you want?

173
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:31,809
I'd probably
get out of that.

174
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:33,961
[whimpers]

175
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,109
[in pain]
Oh!

176
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:49,544
[sigh]

177
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:51,486
Shit.

178
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:54,185
Shit!

179
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:55,556
Ow!

180
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:56,958
What's the matter?

181
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,087
Oh!

182
00:19:58,163 --> 00:19:59,425
What's wrong?

183
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:00,795
No, I just can't
do it like that.

184
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,959
Why?
What'd I do?

185
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,593
You don't even
kiss me.

186
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:07,503
You're just lying there,
like you want me
to rape you!

187
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:08,562
Okay.

188
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,732
You want me
to rape you?

189
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:15,141
I'll kiss you back.

190
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,114
And take
the gloves off.

191
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:42,232
You need
stitches for that.

192
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:44,673
It doesn't really hurt.

193
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:52,207
Not when--
you're kissing me.

194
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:38,189
Some serial killers
use objects when
they can't get it up.

195
00:21:38,263 --> 00:21:40,925
You know,
like they'll, uh,

196
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:47,165
they'll find bottles
[indistinct]

197
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:50,174
and all sorts
of things
out there.

198
00:21:57,049 --> 00:22:01,008
I don't want to talk
about serial
killers anymore.

199
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:22,738
[phone ringing
at other end]

200
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:25,333
(female voice)
91 1 operator,
may I assist you?

201
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:28,777
What's your
emergency? Hello?

202
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,508
91 1.

203
00:22:30,582 --> 00:22:34,780
There's a woman,

204
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:35,911
the woman
needs help.

205
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:37,386
Is she injured?

206
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:39,390
Her daughter
left her.

207
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:42,791
Is the woman
there with you?

208
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:45,489
Hello?

209
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:46,690
No.

210
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:48,323
Where is she?

211
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,389
Ma'am?

212
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:51,766
She's in the house--

213
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:53,464
where they found
the dead girl.

214
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:02,840
(female voice)
They finally approved
our proposal,

215
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:06,680
to post a missing
childrens' board
near Jenny's bench.

216
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:10,811
It's good, it's good.
It'll just be one more
way of spreading the word.

217
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:12,522
(young female voice)
Oh.

218
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:14,889
Pigtail shot, you know,
we've overdone that.

219
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,587
I'm gonna have
to rule that out.

220
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:18,686
Your father thinks
we should go
with the headband

221
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:22,359
but, l--l--I like
the Christmas tree.

222
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:24,095
Y eah.

223
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:28,265
We have used this shot
so many times,
you know, l--

224
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,864
maybe the pigtails.

225
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:32,739
[loud water from tap]

226
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:39,911
the black
and white is not--

227
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:43,580
doing it for me anymore,
I think the color
would be better.

228
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:48,786
So, I'm--I'm gonna,
yeah, I'm gonna
go with the color.

229
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,521
I don 't know.

230
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:53,496
Maybe we should go
with the age progression.

231
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:56,056
Whichever you think.

232
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:04,765
What do you think
it might look like
to move on?

233
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:08,142
Well, my mom,

234
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:11,273
and Dad
and me, we'd--

235
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:14,113
pack up all the stuff
from her room,

236
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:19,488
and we'd take
all the boxes
with the--

237
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:25,497
newspaper reports,
and the false leads,
and the posters, and--

238
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:31,469
we'd burn everything
in a big bonfire.

239
00:24:31,536 --> 00:24:37,532
And then we'd--cry
and hold one another.

240
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:40,203
and then we'd--

241
00:24:40,278 --> 00:24:43,111
fall asleep
for like--

242
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:46,912
a thousand years

243
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:48,646
and then,
in the morning,

244
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:57,651
we'd wake up and--
the sun would be
shining and--

245
00:24:57,729 --> 00:25:01,825
my mom would
go back into
the kitchen

246
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:07,998
and start making
breakfast and--

247
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:17,243
my dad would say,
"Go get ready for school"
and smile.

248
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:20,478
And--

249
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:22,782
everything would
be okay again.

250
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:28,724
[rain and thunder]

251
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:33,662
Well, not okay, but--
you got a chance to be.

252
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:40,894
She's been
gone for--

253
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:46,308
1 5 years.

254
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:49,006
It'll never be okay.

255
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:57,712
It'll never be over.

256
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:14,605
I'm heading out.

257
00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:16,072
Oh. Okay.

258
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:18,769
Murray wants to do
the Jane Doe
in the morning.

259
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:20,435
She's parked
in the deep freeze.

260
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:21,877
Do you mind
prepping her?

261
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:24,108
Sure.

262
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:30,317
My roommate and I are
having a little get together
tomorrow night.

263
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:33,289
Just a host dissertation,

264
00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:37,294
throw-your-computer
out-the-window
celebration kind of thing.

265
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:39,887
Um, if you feel like
stopping by--

266
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:44,425
I'll probably be
in the library
but, thanks.

267
00:26:44,502 --> 00:26:47,562
You could come
by afterwards.

268
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:51,006
I'll see.

269
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:54,170
Okay. Don't
work too hard.

270
00:28:25,503 --> 00:28:27,733
Hasn't your sister
been missing
a long time?

271
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:30,400
She was taken
from the state park
less than ten miles

272
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:33,603
from where this girl's
body was found.

273
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:36,010
Leah, with age-progressed
photos, though--

274
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:37,480
I know,
they're a guess.

275
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:40,040
This girl,
she has a birthmark
on her left hand

276
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:42,643
between her fingers,
same as Jenny.

277
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,245
I want Andy
to do the dentals.

278
00:28:46,591 --> 00:28:48,582
Okay.
All right.

279
00:28:50,295 --> 00:28:51,592
Who is this?

280
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:53,824
Detective sent this photo
as a possible match

281
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:56,059
for a Jane Doe
we have in the morgue.

282
00:28:59,437 --> 00:29:02,565
No. Those
aren't her eyes.

283
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,336
Her--her eyes--

284
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,877
her eyes
aren't that light.

285
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:09,505
She has a birthmark
on her left hand

286
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:12,106
between her fingers
just like Jenny.

287
00:29:12,183 --> 00:29:14,413
No--it's not Jenny.

288
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:16,977
I checked the report
and they can't find
any family.

289
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:19,956
Those are not
her eyes!

290
00:29:20,024 --> 00:29:21,457
It's her.

291
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:23,460
No.

292
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:34,036
[children shouting happily
and dog barking]

293
00:30:13,778 --> 00:30:16,770
Hard to believe
it's over.

294
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:19,408
Yeah, I know.

295
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:24,918
[loud party music]

296
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:41,437
You came.

297
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:42,837
Yeah.

298
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:44,033
All right!

299
00:30:44,108 --> 00:30:46,201
Um, want something
to drink?

300
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:49,542
A beer?
A soda?
Champagne?

301
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:51,775
Um,

302
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,078
champagne.

303
00:30:53,151 --> 00:30:55,142
All right.

304
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:02,548
So, why tonight?

305
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:05,494
I've been inviting
you to my parties
for three years.

306
00:31:05,563 --> 00:31:06,552
Have you?

307
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,765
I don't know
about you but,

308
00:31:10,835 --> 00:31:15,067
every now and then
I like to be around
somebody that's not dead.

309
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:17,198
Yeah, I guess.

310
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:18,572
So, how's it
going so far?

311
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:21,168
So far, so good.

312
00:31:21,246 --> 00:31:22,645
Excellent.

313
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,341
You're a lot
more talkative.

314
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:26,508
Right.

315
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:36,021
I'm on antidepressants.

316
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:38,562
Oh.

317
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:39,927
Oh, yeah?

318
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:43,195
Used to spend
most of my free time
in bed.

319
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:45,759
That could be nice.

320
00:31:45,837 --> 00:31:48,362
It can also be
kind of depressing.

321
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:52,637
Yeah, it's good
to get out of bed
every once in a while.

322
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:55,702
It's kind of hard
to make friends.

323
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,941
In bed?
Yeah.

00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,318
Yeah.

Oh!

Naw, it's nice.

I feel like
if I let go of you,
you're gonna run away.

331
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:48,458
Well, then
don't let go.

Hi.

335
00:33:29,273 --> 00:33:31,537
Stay.
Please?

336
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:34,100
Promise I'll
let you sleep.

337
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:36,772
Oh, no,
I can't,
I have to go.

338
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:39,373
I was getting
kind of sick
of you anyway.

339
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,145
Really?

340
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:43,551
No, just joking.

341
00:33:43,621 --> 00:33:46,089
I'm really glad
you came.

342
00:33:46,157 --> 00:33:48,148
So am l.

Are you?

344
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:52,930
Yeah.
I wanted to,
for a long time.

345
00:33:52,997 --> 00:33:57,559
Really? That's
good to know.

346
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:02,638
Okay, I have to go!
I gotta go.

347
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:05,509

Derek?

353
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:16,447
Hey you.
How you doing?

354
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:20,321
Good.
Good, actually.

355
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:23,189
Work must be
pretty boring
without me.

When you got
a minute.

357
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,727
What are you wearing?
That sexy--

358
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:28,595
I gotta go.
I'll call you back.

359
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:29,928
Wait!

360
00:34:33,504 --> 00:34:35,301
Did Andy
get the stuff?

361
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:37,500
It's not her.

362
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:40,305
Did he check
the films?

363
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:41,970
They were negative
for a match.

364
00:34:42,046 --> 00:34:45,277
I got a call this morning
from a Detective Graily.

365
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:47,249
They tracked down
the girl's mother

366
00:34:47,318 --> 00:34:50,014
and she's driving
down from Washington
to lD the body.

367
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:53,819
Well, that's--wrong.
It has to be,
I mean--

368
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:55,586
The woman's name
is Melora Kutcher,

369
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:58,026
and her daughter's
real name was
Krista Kutcher.

370
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,496
She faxed the detectives
a birth certificate
and a photo.

371
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:02,692
I'm sorry.

372
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,899
Hi, it's Leah,
leave a message.

Leah, it's me.
Are you around?

00:35:40,938 --> 00:35:44,738

You alive?

Okay, I'm just,
uh, trying you again.

378
00:35:54,018 --> 00:35:56,418
Just call me
back, okay?

379
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:58,546
Even if it's just
to tell me to--

380
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:02,059
you know,
leave you
the hell alone.

381
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:04,686
Just want to know
you're okay.

382
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:07,356
Okay.

383
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:15,567

He billed me $ 3, 000
for a a couple of researches.

384
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:22,136
He can't do that.
Jim gave me the name
of another investigator.

385
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:25,910
I wanna have
a memorial service
for Jenny.

386
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:27,450
What?

387
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:29,952
Jenny's dead
and I want to have
a memorial service.

388
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:34,188
Why would you
say that?

389
00:36:34,258 --> 00:36:35,782
Because it's true.

390
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,521
Honey, we
don't know that.

391
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:39,460
She isn't dead,
for all we know--

392
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,589
She's dead.

393
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:43,258
She didn't
run away.

394
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:46,030
She wasn't raised
in the woods
by wolves.

395
00:36:46,103 --> 00:36:47,866
She didn't hit her head
and forget her name

396
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:50,965
and where she lived,
and she's not staying
with some nice gypsies.

397
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:54,034
Some man took her,
and did horrible
things to her.

398
00:36:54,111 --> 00:36:57,080
And hid
her body so well,
that we'll never find her.

399
00:36:57,148 --> 00:36:59,207
And it doesn't matter
how many posters
we hang

400
00:36:59,283 --> 00:37:03,083
or petitions we sign
or which picture
we put near Jenny's bench,

401
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:04,917
because no one's
gonna recognize her,

402
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:07,549
because she's dead
and she's never
coming back!

403
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:10,719
If--she were dead,

404
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:13,457
don't you think
I wouldn't know it
in my heart?

405
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:17,661
I know she's alive,
I know she's out
there somewhere.

406
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:19,930
And the only way
I'm ever gonna
see her again,

407
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:22,165
is if we
never give up.

408
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,573
Someone out there
knows my baby,
they know her,

409
00:37:25,643 --> 00:37:28,077
they just don't know
we're looking for her.

410
00:37:28,145 --> 00:37:32,844
I will never
give up on her.

411
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:38,184
Just like I would
never give up on you!
Ever. Ever!

feel like driving.

Did you ever think
I might want to go
out sometime?

421
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,537
Did you ever
think about that?

422
00:39:40,611 --> 00:39:41,703
Yeah.

423
00:39:41,779 --> 00:39:43,178
But when I want
to go somewhere

424

you don't want to go
if I want to go.

I am a good dancer.

you never took me.

Don't be
like this.

I just want to know.

434

I'm not doing
this anymore.

to step in,

and do your business
while you are
out gallivanting,

when he comes
breathing down
your neck again?

working tomorrow.
He'll be here.

But not you.

I don't know.
Maybe.

I'll see you
later, okay?

No!

hate me so much?

I don't hate you.

452
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:18,505
Then why do you keep
trying to get away
from me all the time?

No, he doesn't,

how lucky he is.

00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:12,179
(female voice)
One message.
Message one.

481
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:16,022
Carl, it's Jim.
I can't come in today.
I really--

482
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:19,529
Message erased.
End of messages.

483
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:26,693
[beeps]

484
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,863
Y eah?

485
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:30,907
Somebody's stuff
is in there.

486
00:43:30,975 --> 00:43:34,467
Nope, it's listed
as an empty.

487
00:43:34,545 --> 00:43:38,413
Uhh, it's not.

488
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:45,721
Well, somebody
made a mistake.

489
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:47,814
Maybe you can just
give us another space.

490
00:43:47,891 --> 00:43:50,416
It's not supposed
to have power.

491
00:43:50,494 --> 00:43:52,291
Yeah, well--

492
00:43:52,363 --> 00:43:54,695
It's supposed
to be empty.
They keep a list.

493
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:02,935
(Man No. 1)
So, are we
moving this?

494
00:44:04,742 --> 00:44:06,300
Uh-uh.

495
00:44:06,377 --> 00:44:09,244
I'll get you
another space.

496
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:07,624
(male voice on TV)
It's better than
40 of these.

497
00:46:07,698 --> 00:46:13,034
(female voice on TV)
The Buggy Beamer Roach Trap
normally costs $ 49. 95.

498
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:14,536
But in this
special offer,

499
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:16,505
[louder]
we'll give two
Buggy Beamers

500
00:46:16,573 --> 00:46:19,007
for the low, low price
of only $ 19. 95.

501
00:46:19,076 --> 00:46:21,601
And if
you call now,

502
00:46:21,678 --> 00:46:25,444
we'll include two extra
disposable cartridges free.

503
00:46:25,516 --> 00:46:30,510
You get two Buggy Beamer
roach traps systems,
plus two extra cartridges.

504
00:46:30,587 --> 00:46:33,579
A $ 1 10 value
for only $ 19. 95.

505
00:46:33,657 --> 00:46:35,591
plus shipping
and handling.

506
00:46:35,659 --> 00:46:41,063
[male voice, indistinct,
on TV]

507
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:55,411
(male voice on TV)
What we were trying to do
is find out if there was

508
00:46:55,479 --> 00:47:00,940
anything that we failed
to accomplish in
our investigation.

509
00:47:01,018 --> 00:47:08,720
We have a pattern
that we feel that, uh,
identifies this individual.

510
00:47:08,792 --> 00:47:12,193
So we're missing
one link.

511
00:47:12,262 --> 00:47:17,723
Smith thinks he knows
someone who can find
that missing link.

512
00:47:17,801 --> 00:47:21,293
I should guess that
Nancy was available.

513
00:47:25,075 --> 00:47:27,441
In a case like this,
she can give us
some assistance.

514
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:30,002
Uh, could open
another door
for us.

515
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,412
I think it's worth
a shot.

516
00:47:32,482 --> 00:47:35,007
Would you contact
her for us?

517
00:47:35,085 --> 00:47:37,178
(male voice No. 2)
That'd be
no problem.

518
00:47:37,254 --> 00:47:41,122
We got the five
all torn up again.

519
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:46,727
I don't know
when they're ever
gonna finish that thing.

520
00:47:46,797 --> 00:47:49,664
It's been
more than a year.

521
00:47:49,733 --> 00:47:51,758
What happened
to your neck?

522
00:47:51,835 --> 00:47:55,464
Some guy in a bar,
tried to pick a fight.

523
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,302
You got
in a fight?

524
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:02,545
I'm done with it.

525
00:48:02,613 --> 00:48:05,081
Leaving me here
to rot while you're
out doing

526
00:48:05,148 --> 00:48:07,173
Mike only knows
what perverted thing

527
00:48:07,251 --> 00:48:10,618
with Mike only knows
what kind of slutty
gutter trash!

528
00:48:10,687 --> 00:48:13,781
Come home
all scratched up.

529
00:48:13,857 --> 00:48:15,848
You think
I don't know
what goes on?

530
00:48:15,926 --> 00:48:18,258
I've got my niece
in Tula vista.

531
00:48:18,328 --> 00:48:21,957
She says Steve
and the kids would be
happy to have me.

532
00:48:22,032 --> 00:48:23,431
Then you'll see
what it's like

533
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,434
when you have no one
to come home to.

534
00:48:25,502 --> 00:48:30,371
When you manage
to drag yourself back
to this "h" hole.

535
00:48:31,942 --> 00:48:33,910
I'm sorry.

536
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:42,147
So you went
to a bar.

537
00:48:42,219 --> 00:48:46,883
Well, mostly
I just drove around.

538
00:48:46,957 --> 00:48:48,549
Went to see Ray.

539
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:50,490
I called Ray.
He hadn't seen you!

540
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:53,393
Well, when you called,
I hadn't gotten there yet.

541
00:48:53,463 --> 00:48:56,432
Were you visiting
prostitutes again?

542
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,195
No!

543
00:48:58,268 --> 00:49:01,704
I'm not sticking by you
this time if the cops
come sniffing around.

544
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:06,937
I'm done with that filth.
Ya hear me?
I'm done with it!

545
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:11,071
You've been sniffing
around prostitutes,
wettin' your little noodle.

546
00:49:11,148 --> 00:49:12,672
Oh, shut up!

547
00:49:12,749 --> 00:49:15,582
You don't like it
when I talk dirty,
but what do you do?

548
00:49:15,652 --> 00:49:17,347
Huh?

549
00:49:17,421 --> 00:49:19,787
Sticking your thing
in anything that moves.

550
00:49:19,856 --> 00:49:21,448
Mind your
own business!

551
00:49:21,525 --> 00:49:25,052
You stop leaving me
here to mind yours
and I will!

552
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:28,097
- I see the scratches
on you!
- [door slams]

553
00:49:28,165 --> 00:49:30,895
I know what
you do!

554
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:31,189
(male voice)
A beautiful blue
Tanzanite Diamond ring.

555
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:36,987
Thank you.

556
00:51:47,404 --> 00:51:50,066
Do you know anything
about those dead girls?

557
00:51:51,374 --> 00:51:52,363
No.

558
00:51:57,681 --> 00:52:01,617
[light snoring]

559
00:55:32,262 --> 00:55:35,425
(female voice)
Well, it would have
been about, uh,

560
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:38,490
nineteen,

561
00:55:39,202 --> 00:55:43,832
ninety-three, I think, it was,
no, that's not right. Um,

562
00:55:43,907 --> 00:55:48,469
she was 1 6,

563
00:55:48,545 --> 00:55:52,743
she left home,
when she was 1 6.

564
00:55:52,816 --> 00:55:57,810
And that was
the last time--

565
00:55:57,887 --> 00:56:01,220
I wrote to her
and I left messages.

566
00:56:01,291 --> 00:56:03,191
When I had
a number.

567
00:56:05,095 --> 00:56:08,326
She was very angry.

568
00:56:08,398 --> 00:56:09,990
She made it
perfectly clear

569
00:56:10,066 --> 00:56:14,628
she didn't want me
or her stepfather

570
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:17,468
involved in her life.

571
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:21,032
Did you know
that she relocated
to Los Angeles?

572
00:56:21,111 --> 00:56:23,375
I thought she might--

573
00:56:23,446 --> 00:56:25,812
go to Hollywood.

574
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:27,577
She always spoke
about wanting to be

575
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:31,142
on Tv when
she was little.

576
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:35,555
But you don't expect--

577
00:56:35,625 --> 00:56:41,086
and they're just
dreams a child has.

578
00:56:41,164 --> 00:56:43,064
All right,
just hang in
for a minute?

579
00:57:07,323 --> 00:57:08,984
Oh.

580
00:57:14,397 --> 00:57:15,591
Oh.

581
00:57:20,837 --> 00:57:23,863
(police officer)
You gonna be around town
for another day?

582
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:27,205
I was going
to drive home--

583
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:29,074
tomorrow but
if you need me--

584
00:57:29,145 --> 00:57:32,979
Anything else we need,
we can probably take
care of it over the phone.

585
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:36,680
Okay.

586
00:57:45,195 --> 00:57:46,753
Okay.

587
00:58:09,586 --> 00:58:12,419
I--I was wondering
if, um,

588
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:18,282
if--if Krista Kutcher
lived here.

589
00:58:18,361 --> 00:58:20,488
She did.

590
00:58:22,265 --> 00:58:24,825
I was hoping
I could see
her room.

591
00:58:24,901 --> 00:58:29,668
Somebody's in there.

592
00:58:29,739 --> 00:58:32,207
See the girl over there
on the phone?

593
00:58:32,275 --> 00:58:36,143
If she wants
to show it to you,
by my guest.

594
00:58:36,212 --> 00:58:39,409
(girl in booth, weeping)
T ommy, just come
and get me.

595
00:58:39,482 --> 00:58:41,507
Who the fuck
was that?

596
00:58:41,584 --> 00:58:45,179
Go fuck
yourself, T ommy!

597
00:58:45,255 --> 00:58:46,654
Excuse me.

598
00:58:46,723 --> 00:58:47,712
Excuse me.

599
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:48,848
Do I know you?

600
00:58:48,925 --> 00:58:52,884
I'm sorry,
I just wanted, l--

601
00:58:52,962 --> 00:58:55,624
I spoke to the woman
inside the office.

602
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:59,759
I was wondering
if I could see
your room.

603
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:07,267
[clears throat]

604
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:23,188
Did you know the girl
who used to live here?

605
00:59:23,259 --> 00:59:24,419
Yeah, I knew her.

606
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:30,263
Were you friends?

607
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:32,062
We lived together.

608
01:00:14,677 --> 01:00:17,441
It was a nice picture.

609
01:00:17,513 --> 01:00:19,606
Yeah, she liked
that one.

610
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:35,188
What kind of things
do they make you do?

611
01:00:35,264 --> 01:00:36,788
What?

612
01:00:41,504 --> 01:00:43,199
The men
who pay you.

613
01:00:43,272 --> 01:00:45,968
You're asking me
what I do
on a date?

614
01:00:46,042 --> 01:00:48,476
When you get paid.

615
01:00:48,544 --> 01:00:50,774
Yeah, that's a date.

616
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:54,574
I don't know,
whatever they want.

617
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:56,118
Head, usually.

618
01:00:59,088 --> 01:01:00,521
How much
do they pay you?

619
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:02,683
You a reporter?

620
01:01:02,759 --> 01:01:04,590
You want to do
a story on me?

621
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:07,824
Let's see,
my mom's dead.
She was a junkie.

622
01:01:07,897 --> 01:01:09,831
She got shot
in the head
in a parking lot.

623
01:01:09,899 --> 01:01:11,332
My dad,
I never knew him.

624
01:01:11,401 --> 01:01:13,062
I grew up in East L.A.

625
01:01:13,136 --> 01:01:17,436
Now I suck off
assholes for cash.
What do you think about that?

626
01:01:19,709 --> 01:01:23,611
I think it's sad.

627
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,807
Yeah, well--

628
01:01:30,787 --> 01:01:33,085
Did Krista ever tell you
where she came from?

629
01:01:33,156 --> 01:01:38,093
A la--wa Washington,
some fucking place,
I don't remember.

630
01:01:38,161 --> 01:01:41,597
Did she tell you
why she ran away?

631
01:01:41,664 --> 01:01:45,225
She probably
wasn't happy.

632
01:01:45,301 --> 01:01:47,667
Did she tell
you why?

633
01:01:47,737 --> 01:01:51,798
Other than her stepfather
sticking his dick in her,
I don't think so.

634
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:55,640
She probably thought
"Fuck it, I might
as well get paid. "

635
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:57,976
Fucking mother
was too much
of a dishrag

636
01:01:58,047 --> 01:01:59,810
to do anything about it,
you know, typical.

637
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:02,180
The husband or the kids,
they always choose
the husband.

638
01:02:02,251 --> 01:02:03,582
Did she tell you that?

639
01:02:03,653 --> 01:02:04,984
What?

640
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:08,182
That her mother
knew and--

641
01:02:08,257 --> 01:02:09,315
chose him?

642
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:10,825
She probably
liked it, right?

643
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:12,360
It took some
of the load off.

644
01:02:12,428 --> 01:02:14,521
Like having
one of your kids
help with the laundry.

645
01:02:29,479 --> 01:02:30,571
You're her mom?

646
01:03:18,561 --> 01:03:22,657
I didn't know.

647
01:03:22,732 --> 01:03:24,723
Okay.

648
01:03:28,938 --> 01:03:32,738
I had no idea.

649
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:34,436
Well now you know.

650
01:03:37,313 --> 01:03:40,305
This has been really fun
and all but I gotta
get to work.

651
01:03:40,383 --> 01:03:43,352
Maybe I can take
you to lunch.

652
01:03:43,419 --> 01:03:46,115
I don't think so.

653
01:03:46,189 --> 01:03:49,750
I'll pay you.

654
01:03:50,259 --> 01:03:53,251
(hooker)
One time Krista
went totally straight.

655
01:03:53,362 --> 01:03:54,659
No drugs,
no hooking,

656
01:03:54,730 --> 01:03:56,322
she got a job
at a nail salon.

657
01:03:56,399 --> 01:03:58,094
She was like
a fucking Mormon.

658
01:03:58,167 --> 01:04:00,601
All she talked about
was how she wanted
to get her shit together

659
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:02,638
so that she could bring
her kid to live with us.

660
01:04:02,705 --> 01:04:06,266
And then, Del said
that she would have
to pay extra

661
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:10,108
so Krista had three jobs
and she was working,

662
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:13,376
she was doing more drugs
than ever because she
wanted to stay awake.

663
01:04:13,449 --> 01:04:16,748
So she wound up getting
nail polish on this
white lady's wedding ring.

664
01:04:16,819 --> 01:04:19,253
I'm sorry,
Krista had a child?

665
01:04:19,322 --> 01:04:21,813
Yeah, so then
she gets fired
from this nail place.

666
01:04:21,891 --> 01:04:25,224
and she goes on
this fucked up drug mix
like you wouldn't believe.

667
01:04:25,294 --> 01:04:27,421
I didn't hear from her
for like two weeks.

668
01:04:27,496 --> 01:04:29,896
Is it a girl
or a boy?

669
01:04:29,966 --> 01:04:32,161
A girl.

670
01:04:32,235 --> 01:04:34,032
Ashley.

671
01:04:34,103 --> 01:04:36,162
She was really
into that kid.

672
01:04:36,239 --> 01:04:38,901
Always sending her cards
and writing notes
and shit.

673
01:04:38,975 --> 01:04:41,068
Even though
the girl can't read.

674
01:04:41,143 --> 01:04:45,375
It was like she
didn't want her
to grow up hating her.

675
01:04:45,448 --> 01:04:48,110
Where is she?

676
01:04:48,184 --> 01:04:49,208
What?

677
01:04:49,285 --> 01:04:50,877
Where?
Where is she?

678
01:04:50,953 --> 01:04:53,012
[children shouting]

679
01:05:04,934 --> 01:05:08,961
[female voices
speaking Spanish]

680
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:26,448
Oh.

681
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:29,623
Hi.

682
01:05:29,692 --> 01:05:32,286
Hi.

683
01:05:32,361 --> 01:05:34,226
Come here.

684
01:05:36,198 --> 01:05:38,598
Hi, sweetheart.

685
01:05:38,668 --> 01:05:43,230
Ashley.

686
01:05:43,306 --> 01:05:45,638
Honey, look at me.

687
01:05:51,147 --> 01:05:52,614
She wants money.

688
01:06:00,723 --> 01:06:02,486
I only have 200.
Is that okay?

689
01:06:02,558 --> 01:06:04,287
Give it to her.

690
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:05,622
Here. T ake it.

691
01:06:15,338 --> 01:06:19,104
Hi, Ashley.
I'm your
momma's momma.

692
01:06:19,175 --> 01:06:24,613
Do you want
to come with
me, honey?

693
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:25,874
Okay.

694
01:06:25,948 --> 01:06:28,746
Maybe you can sit
in the back with her.

695
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:30,683
She really stinks.

696
01:06:30,753 --> 01:06:32,084
She needs a bath.

697
01:06:32,154 --> 01:06:33,849
Yeah, with a fucking
fire hose.

698
01:06:33,923 --> 01:06:35,857
Would you watch
your language, please?

699
01:06:35,925 --> 01:06:38,325
Shouldn't you
be using one
of those baby seats?

700
01:06:38,394 --> 01:06:41,363
That's why I'm asking you
to sit in the back with her.

701
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:43,091
You could get
in an accident.

702
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:44,928
You expect me
to catch her?

703
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:47,902
Would it be better
if I just left her here?

704
01:06:47,970 --> 01:06:49,301
Would that be better?

705
01:06:49,372 --> 01:06:51,772
Whatever, man,
I'm just saying.

706
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:54,002
I don't even know
how I would find
a car seat

707
01:06:54,076 --> 01:06:57,512
around here,
in this neighborhood.

708
01:06:59,515 --> 01:07:01,005
She's not my kid.

709
01:07:03,319 --> 01:07:04,513
I'll buy one tomorrow.

710
01:07:04,587 --> 01:07:07,647
So are you
gonna keep her?

711
01:07:14,096 --> 01:07:20,626
(grandmother)
 You are my sunshine
My only sunshine

712
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:26,767
You make me happy
When skies are gray

713
01:07:26,842 --> 01:07:29,834
You'll never know, dear

714
01:07:29,912 --> 01:07:32,574
How much I love you

715
01:07:32,648 --> 01:07:35,845
Shh. Shh. Shh.

716
01:07:39,655 --> 01:07:41,885
You gonna keep her?

717
01:07:44,593 --> 01:07:46,322
I just need to know.

718
01:07:46,395 --> 01:07:48,556
Are you?

719
01:07:48,631 --> 01:07:54,297
I guess that's something
that I have to discuss
with the father.

720
01:07:54,370 --> 01:07:55,735
Good luck.

721
01:07:55,805 --> 01:07:57,739
It could have been
a million guys.

722
01:07:59,942 --> 01:08:02,274
I would've taken her.

723
01:08:02,344 --> 01:08:05,074
I almost went
and got her.

724
01:08:08,751 --> 01:08:11,914
How am I supposed
to take care of her kid?

725
01:08:14,023 --> 01:08:16,617
If you decide
to take her, just--

726
01:08:18,327 --> 01:08:19,624
take care of her.

727
01:08:23,899 --> 01:08:25,594
Did you love
my daughter?

728
01:08:25,668 --> 01:08:30,298
She tried to give me
a necklace, and--

729
01:08:30,372 --> 01:08:33,773
I didn't take it.

730
01:08:33,843 --> 01:08:36,937
I wanted to,
and just couldn't.

731
01:08:51,827 --> 01:08:57,424
Shh. Shh.

732
01:09:17,119 --> 01:09:18,677
You could wait
a minute?

733
01:09:18,754 --> 01:09:20,847
Okay.

734
01:09:43,312 --> 01:09:48,181
She said it made her look
how she wanted to feel.

735
01:09:52,288 --> 01:09:53,755
I live alone now.

736
01:09:53,822 --> 01:09:57,849
And if you want it,
you could come
and stay with me.

737
01:09:57,927 --> 01:10:00,919
Get back
on your feet.

738
01:10:00,996 --> 01:10:03,021
There couldn't be
any drugs in my house

that's something
I just can't have but--

740
01:10:06,101 --> 01:10:09,730
if you want,
you're welcome
to stay.

741
01:10:09,805 --> 01:10:12,569
I don't think so.

742
01:10:18,914 --> 01:10:22,008
Wait.
Wait, wait!

743
01:10:38,634 --> 01:10:41,364
There is my address.

744
01:10:41,437 --> 01:10:44,668
Maybe, you could
write me some time.

745
01:10:46,375 --> 01:10:48,969
"Awapaho, Washington."

746
01:10:49,044 --> 01:10:52,070

something like that.

we'd go through
the Sears catalog

and pick out
what we wanted.

and I'm really excited
about this doll, right?

01:15:24,019 --> 01:15:28,353

that's too far from here.

953
01:24:37,372 --> 01:24:39,499
Is that where
you live?

954
01:24:39,574 --> 01:24:41,474
My daughter
lives there.

955
01:24:41,543 --> 01:24:45,479
Tomorrow's her birthday.
Actually, it's already today.

956
01:24:45,547 --> 01:24:48,948
She was born at 12: 13
in the morning.

957
01:24:49,017 --> 01:24:50,780
This,

958
01:24:50,852 --> 01:24:56,256
this was supposed
to be for her but, um,

959
01:24:56,324 --> 01:24:58,258
I kinda fucked it up.

960
01:25:00,929 --> 01:25:04,695
I have to make a stop.

961
01:25:04,766 --> 01:25:07,929
But then I could
probably take you
to Norwalk.

962
01:25:08,002 --> 01:25:10,266
Really?

963
01:25:10,338 --> 01:25:13,364
God!
This is so cool!

964
01:25:15,977 --> 01:25:18,571
Great, I could be there
when she wakes up.

965
01:25:18,646 --> 01:25:23,140
I could bring her
chocolate chip pancakes.

966
01:25:23,218 --> 01:25:26,779
Having your own kid,

967
01:25:26,855 --> 01:25:29,346
is a pretty amazing thing.

968
01:25:29,424 --> 01:25:33,451
You know,
her father was
a real fucking asshole.

969
01:25:33,528 --> 01:25:35,018
The whole time
she was in me

970
01:25:35,096 --> 01:25:37,690
I was afraid
she would come
out looking like him but,

971
01:25:37,765 --> 01:25:40,598
she didn't.

972
01:25:40,668 --> 01:25:43,136
She looked
just like me.

973
01:25:43,204 --> 01:25:45,069
A whole lot prettier.

974
01:26:10,231 --> 01:26:14,668
You are my sunshine

975
01:26:14,736 --> 01:26:19,764
My only sunshine

976
01:26:19,841 --> 01:26:25,939
You make me happy

977
01:26:26,014 --> 01:26:30,383
When skies are gray

978
01:26:30,451 --> 01:26:34,547
You'll never know, dear

979
01:26:34,622 --> 01:26:41,084
How much I love you

980
01:26:41,162 --> 01:26:44,029
Please don't take

981
01:26:44,098 --> 01:26:49,161
My sunshine away

982
01:26:49,237 --> 01:27:03,413
[sad music]

983
