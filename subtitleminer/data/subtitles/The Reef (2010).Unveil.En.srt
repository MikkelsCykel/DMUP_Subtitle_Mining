1
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Hey, hey! Hello, mate.

2
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,920
- Oh, it's good to see you.
- You too.

3
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,240
- How are you?
- Great.

4
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,880
Luke, this is my girlfriend, Suzie.
Suzie, Luke.

5
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,160
- Hi. It's so nice to meet you.
- And you know my sister Kate.

6
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,320
- Kate.
- Luke.

7
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,800
- Looking good.
- Thanks. I'll take that.

8
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,200
- Thank you.
- Let's go.

9
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,720
- Wow, you really bought a car?
- No.

10
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,560
After our sail, I've gotta deliver
the boat to Indonesia,

11
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,480
and the guy who's crewing for me
owns this.

12
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,360
- We're not keeping you from delivering?
- No, it's all good.

13
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,520
I can't believe you get to sail around
the world delivering boats for a living.

14
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,440
How fantastic.

15
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,560
Go introduce yourselves to Wazza.

16
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,800
The scruffy-looking one
fishing off a yacht.

17
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,960
- Cool.
- Great.

18
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,560
See you soon.

19
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,560
So how have you been?

20
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,800
Good. Good. You?

21
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,880
Yeah, good. I'm going to get
some spark plugs. You wanna come?

22
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,200
Sure.

23
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,880
- Shane.
- Hey.

24
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,960
- Is Lou here?
- Yeah, he's just out the back.

25
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,520
- Hey, Lou.
- Yeah, out here!

26
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,080
- It's pretty impressive.
- Yeah.

27
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,000
That's a mako, tiger, hammerhead.

28
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,880
And that one's a white pointer.

29
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,360
Where'd you get these?

30
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,360
- Out there.
- Here?

31
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,680
Yeah. Strange about
the white pointer, though.

32
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,600
People reckon
they don't usually come this far north.

33
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,080
Don't worry. What do they say?

34
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,960
You're more likely to die from
a bee sting than get killed by a shark.

35
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,480
- Wazza.
- Hey.

36
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,400
- Kate. Kate, Warren.
- Hi.

37
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,840
- Hi.
- How you going?

38
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,920
- Good.
- Welcome aboard.

39
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,160
- It's not bad.
- She's a bit scruffy, but she'll do.

40
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,360
I'll show you where you're sleeping.

41
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,040
This brings back memories.

42
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,680
- This is yours.
- Hey, so... I bought you something.

43
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,160
I wonder what this could be?

44
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,240
Thank you.

45
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,440
I really miss you.

46
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,880
- Sorry.
- It's OK.

47
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,960
- Is there someone else?
- No, there's nobody else. It's just...

48
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,920
You wanted a break
and now you're back.

49
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,720
Matt really wanted me to come,
and a holiday sounded like a good idea.

50
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,160
So that's what this is,
it's just a holiday?

51
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,800
Yeah, yeah, I'm here for a holiday.

52
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,560
OK. Good.

53
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,720
I've gotta go up.
Wanna catch the outgoing tide.

54
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,960
OK.

55
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,600
Oh, wow. Did you just catch that?

56
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,960
Yep. These waters are full of 'em.

57
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,880
- Cool.
- You in from Sydney?

58
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,840
Yeah, my brother and his girlfriend
are here from London.

59
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,560
And you're crewing with Luke
to Indonesia?

60
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,840
- Yeah.
- Have you crewed with him before?

61
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,520
No. No, this is the first time.
I usually work the fishing boats.

62
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,720
Thought I'd try something different.

63
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,440
- You've crewed with him, haven't you?
- How do you know that?

64
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,840
- He talks a bit about you.
- Oh.

65
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:25,000
Yeah, yeah, we sailed
the Mediterranean together.

66
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,080
Whoa! Looks like we're off.

67
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,600
So where are we heading?

68
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,760
Cygnet Reef. I wanna try and get there
by this afternoon.

69
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,200
Sounds great. What's there?

70
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,880
You'll see.

71
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,960
Hey, we're here.

72
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,760
- You good? See you.
- Bye!

73
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,960
Have fun!

74
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,800
See you soon.

75
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,200
Sorry.

76
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,840
- You all right?
- Yeah.

77
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,400
Come with me.

78
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,120
Wow.

79
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,960
Wow, wow.

80
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,000
- How was that?
- Amazing.

81
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,600
- Is this your favourite spot?
- Actually, I've never been here before.

82
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,400
- Wanna go for a bit of an explore?
- Yep.

83
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,840
No.

84
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,080
Oh.

85
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,240
Look what I found.

86
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,240
Beautiful.

87
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,280
What?

88
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,480
I don't know.

89
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,920
Is this just sex
or is it something else?

90
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,680
I don't know.

91
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,520
You know what I think?
I think you're scared.

92
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,480
- Scared?
- Mm-hm.

93
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:54,160
- Scared of what?
- Me.

94
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,240
You. Us.

95
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,920
No, that's not it.

96
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,360
What is it, then?

97
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,800
I don't know.

98
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,280
- Come on, Kate, what?
- I don't know.

99
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,880
One minute we're having a good time,
and now we're not.

100
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,560
- I'll tell you what I think.
- I don't really care what you think.

101
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,480
Hey, Luke, Kate!
There's something up with Warren.

102
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:30,360
Tide's dropping really fast.

103
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,800
We hit bottom.
Kate, can you keep an eye out?

104
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,240
- I think it's leaking.
- Eh?

105
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,080
- You're scraping.
- The tide's dropping really fast.

106
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,840
I tried the engine.
She won't start.

107
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,480
- OK, try now.
- Nothing.

108
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,720
- Now.
- No, nothing.

109
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,160
Jump on the anchor.
Katie, can you get the sail, please?

110
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,080
Yeah.

111
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,280
Channel's opened up!

112
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:10,080
OK, I think we're out of trouble.
Thanks, guys.

113
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,840
Hey, Waz,
take a look at that engine, yeah?

114
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,920
Katie, steer.

115
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,600
- Sure.
- Keep her straight, yeah?

116
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:23,760
- We'll just keep it straight.
- Yeah.

117
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,520
So, who wants a go?

118
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,920
- Suze?
- Me?

119
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,680
- Yeah, come on. Chance of a lifetime.
- Go on. Go on.

120
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,440
Two hands.

121
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,120
Good.

122
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,280
- Sailing.
- Hey!

123
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,480
Arr! Arr!

124
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,400
Hey. Thought I'd come up
and catch the morning.

125
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,240
It's gorgeous.

126
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,160
I'm really sorry about yesterday.

127
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,320
Yeah. Me too.

128
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,040
- It's tricky, isn't it?
- Yeah.

129
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,920
You don't have any doubts about us?

130
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,280
Plenty.

131
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:55,040
It's just, you know,
I really missed you.

132
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,160
I really missed you too.

133
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,600
- You hungry?
- Starving.

134
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,440
- Brekky?
- Yes, please.

135
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,240
Matt! Warren!

136
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,720
You all right? We've gotta
get out of here. It could go down.

137
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,680
Where's Matt? Matt? Matt?

138
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,000
Luke! Matt!

139
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,240
Oh, Suzie.

140
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,720
Mattie! Warren!

141
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,640
You all right?

142
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:24,360
I'm gonna go down and get Matt.
Hey, Warren, you gotta get out.

143
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,840
Come with me, right? Take a deep breath.

144
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,640
- Matt. Where's Matt?
- Matt? Where's Matt?

145
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,480
Matt! Mattie?

146
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,480
Here! I'm here.

147
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,400
It's stuck.

148
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,840
This way, this way, this way.

149
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,600
OK, follow me.

150
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,400
You all right? You OK?
Yeah? You OK?

151
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,080
- Let's get out of the water.
- Yeah. Yeah, sure.

152
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,680
- Gonna have to push him.
- Yeah, OK.

153
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,800
One, two, three!

154
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,520
Up you get.

155
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,000
All right, who's next?

156
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,440
- You got me?
- Come on.

157
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,440
OK, here we go. More hands.

158
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,800
- You all right, Suze?
- Yeah.

159
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,880
Fuck. Look at that.
Keel's been ripped off.

160
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,320
- You OK?
- It's OK. You all right?

161
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,480
Yeah.

162
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,320
- What happened?
- Don't know.

163
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,920
Must have hit something.

164
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,280
Reef. A whale.

165
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,760
The bulkheads are fucked.

166
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,280
OK, guys, I don't think
we should stay here.

167
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:16,440
There's a current.
We're drifting further out to sea.

168
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,200
The boat's fucked.
I don't think it's gonna stay afloat.

169
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:27,680
And when we do sink, we're in the water,
just further from land.

170
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,320
- It mightn't sink.
- Well, is there an EPIRB?

171
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,560
- What's an EPIRB?
- A distress beacon. Yeah, there is.

172
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:38,880
Yeah, but it's an old one, so you need
a plane to fly over to get a signal.

173
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,360
- We're not in a flight path.
- How do you know that?

174
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,000
Seen any planes in the last few days?

175
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,200
OK, I'm not saying we should
try and swim to the mainland,

176
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,080
but I reckon
we could make Turtle Is land.

177
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,000
No.

178
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,000
- What are you doing?
- Point the 12 at the sun.

179
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,480
Split the angle between the 12
and the hour hand. That's north.

180
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:36,040
So, we're here, right?

181
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,120
Turtle Is land is here.

182
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,120
Now, we weren't going straight there,
because there's a reef here.

183
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:45,040
But with the current, I reckon
if we swim north, we'll hit the island.

184
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:52,920
- How far would we have to swim?
- Uh... 10, 12 miles.

185
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,920
Good luck.
I've fished these waters, mate.

186
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,600
I know what's out there.
I'm not getting in that water.

187
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,240
What makes you think
they're not gonna come here?

188
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,920
There's all sorts of shit
starting to rot.

189
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:07,720
I don't wanna argue with you, mate,
honestly I don't. I just...

190
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,160
I'm not getting in the water.

191
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:19,880
All right, look, yeah,
there might be sharks, I don't know.

192
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,080
What I do know
is that there's land over there

193
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:26,320
and the longer we sit here,
the further we get away from it.

194
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,920
We either swim for it
and try and save ourselves,

195
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,840
while we've still got enough strength,

196
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,680
or we can stay here
and hope the boat doesn't sink

197
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,080
and that someone comes for us.

198
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:43,520
And they'd better come soon, because
otherwise we'll die of dehydration.

199
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,240
I'm not a great swimmer.
I don't think I could swim that far.

200
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,200
Yeah, no. Me neither.

201
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,080
OK.

202
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:02,200
All right. I'll go down below and see
what I can find to keep us afloat.

203
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,720
You need a hand?

204
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,440
Yeah, if you're in the water,
I'll pass out whatever I find, yeah?

205
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:24,000
- You OK?
- Yeah.

206
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,840
- Here goes.
- OK.

207
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,560
Luke! Luke!

208
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,480
Hey, Luke! Luke!

209
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:55,840
Luke, mate, can you hear me?

210
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:02,360
There's something in the water.
Hey! Luke, quickly, get out! It's close!

211
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,680
Get out now! Get out!

212
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:13,200
Luke, there's something
in the water! Could be a shark!

213
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,600
Luke, come on! Hurry up!

214
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,360
Get out! Luke!

215
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,480
Luke!

216
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,560
Luke!

217
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,280
Something broke the surface, over there.

218
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,920
- Well, what was it?
- I don't know, but it was big.

219
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,640
All right.
I've still got to find the EPIRB.

220
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,720
So unless you see a really big shark,
don't warn me.

221
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,920
See you soon.

222
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,240
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

223
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,440
Found it.

224
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,440
- You know how to kick it off?
- It's good, mate.

225
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,880
Yeah? OK, great.

226
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,720
Try that.

227
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,480
- For you.
- Thanks, mate.

228
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:20,320
- What? What's the matter?
- You'll look like a seal in that.

229
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,000
Sharks love seals.

230
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,960
Mate, you don't wanna come,
that's your business.

231
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,480
Don't go scaring everyone else,
all right?

232
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,120
Maybe we should wait.

233
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,760
OK, it's your choice.

234
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:49,560
Look, I know
this is a difficult decision,

235
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,640
but it's really easy
not to get found out here.

236
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:57,120
This boat's gonna sink
and it's gonna sink soon.

237
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,880
There's land over there and that's
where I think we should be going.

238
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,040
I'm going with Luke.

239
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,520
Me too.

240
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,960
That's yours.

241
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,480
Here you go. Take that. Yours.

242
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,760
- I'm not going.
- Hey?

243
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,960
I'm gonna stay here.

244
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,920
It's a better option
than staying on the boat.

245
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,800
What, swimming to an island
you can't see?

246
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,680
Kate...

247
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,640
OK.

248
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,360
- OK, that's for you.
- Thanks.

249
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,200
Are you sure about this?

250
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,760
Yeah?

251
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,760
- We'll send someone as soon as we can.
- OK.

252
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,080
- OK?
- Yep.

253
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,360
See you, mate.

254
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,280
See you soon.

255
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,200
Bye.

256
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,840
- See you back there.
- Definitely.

257
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,480
What are you doing?

258
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,000
You know he knows the ocean
more than any of us.

259
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,080
- Come on, Katie, come with us.
- I can't.

260
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,440
I just... I just can't.

261
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,440
- See you later, sis.
- Bye.

262
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,520
Yeah?

263
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,600
OK, let's go.

264
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:02,360
- You look after her for me, all right?
- I will, don't worry. We're good.

265
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,920
OK, so let's stick together.

266
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,480
We're gonna get tired,

267
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:43,280
but if we just stay at a steady pace,
we'll get there, yeah?

268
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:48,960
Apart from that, relax and enjoy.
It's a once in a lifetime.

269
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,600
Let's go.

270
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,280
Hey, guys!

271
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:52,400
- Not so much splashing.
- Did you see something?

272
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,360
- No.
- Hey! Hey, wait!

273
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,240
Wait! I'm gonna come with you!

274
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,600
Come on. Come with us.

275
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,760
- No.
- Are you sure?

276
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,560
Yeah, no, you go. I'll be right.

277
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,560
This is nuts.
I hope you're right about this.

278
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,320
You're not the only one.

279
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:05,440
Guys, don't worry, we'll make it.
We'll get there.

280
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,000
- Here, take this.
- Are you sure?

281
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,280
Yeah, it's all right.
We'll share this one.

282
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,760
Thanks.

283
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:15,000
Hey, guys. We're tired.

284
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,600
So we focus our energy, huh?

285
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:23,880
Imagine there's a guy with a huge rope
pulling us towards the island.

286
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:27,000
- Or towards my bed.
- Mm.

287
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,000
- There's always the last resort.
- What's that?

288
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:43,480
When I'm at the gym and I'm trying
to break through the pain barrier,

289
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,160
I imagine that I'm having sex.

290
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,440
While you're doing weights,
you're imagining you're screwing?

291
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,520
Notjust screwing.
There's foreplay as well.

292
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,200
Well, isn't there?

293
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,600
Not often.

294
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:07,040
Oh, come on!

295
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,120
Don't listen to her.

296
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,920
- Shit. What was that?
- What?

297
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,520
Oh!

298
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,120
What is it?

299
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,440
Can't see anything.

300
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,680
I think it's a school of small fish.

301
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,040
- What are they doing?
- I don't know.

302
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,560
OK, let's keep going.

303
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,480
Come on.

304
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,520
- What is it?
- Looks like a shell.

305
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:27,000
- It's a turtle shell.
- Yeah, I think you're right.

306
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,160
A turtle?

307
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,120
Hey, Matt.

308
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,520
Mattie.

309
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,880
Oh, fuck!

310
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,400
Let's get the fuck out of here.

311
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,280
Come on, Suze.

312
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,400
Hey, we can't stay here.

313
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,760
Come on.

314
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:25,000
I don't wanna stretch my legs out,
I really don't.

315
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,640
- OK, all right.
- I can't move.

316
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:31,240
It's all right. Listen, we've gotta go.
So do you want me to go behind you?

317
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,080
Come on, love.
I'll go behind you, OK?

318
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,320
I got you.

319
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,960
- You OK?
- Yeah.

320
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:58,040
- That was a big turtle.
- Fuck, yeah.

321
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:41,600
What was that?

322
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:46,640
- What?
- Over there, I saw something.

323
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,480
I can't see anything.

324
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:55,400
- Suzie, you're freaking me out.
- What's the matter?

325
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,600
- There's something here.
- We have to keep going.

326
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:00,840
- There's something following us.
- Suze, this is the ocean, OK?

327
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,560
There's a million things out here, bub.
We've gotta keep going.

328
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,880
We've gotta get going.

329
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:09,560
Come on. Gotta go, all right?

330
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,400
- It's all right.
- There!

331
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:17,320
- All right, Suze, listen...
- I'm sure I saw something and it's big!

332
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:21,400
- OK, so what did you see?
- I don't know. There! There, look.

333
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,080
I can't see anything.

334
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:45,360
Over there.

335
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:19,360
- Did you see something?
- Don't know. Maybe.

336
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,360
- I told you.
- What was it?

337
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:23,760
- Was it a shark?
- I don't know, OK?

338
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:27,440
Let's keep going.

339
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,440
- OK, it's a shark.
- How big?

340
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,920
It's big. It's all right. Come together.

341
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:03,160
I can't see it.

342
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:07,360
Get in together.

343
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:26,960
Can you see it?
Luke, can you see it?

344
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:29,560
I think it's gone.
I can't see it anywhere.

345
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:42,920
Let's go. Let's go.
We've gotta go this way.

346
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,960
This way.

347
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:19,960
It's OK, it's OK.
I can't see it. It's moved away.

348
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:24,080
It's OK. I can't see it. I can't see it.
You need to calm down.

349
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:28,480
I can't see it. It's OK.
It's OK. It's OK.

350
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:30,600
You have to stay calm.

351
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:20,720
Katie. Katie.

352
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:23,800
Katie. Katie. Katie.

353
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:30,000
Take some deep breaths with me.
Deep breaths. Come on.

354
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:33,160
You'll be all right. It's not gonna
get you. It's not gonna get you.

355
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:35,920
Take a deep breath.

356
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,840
It's gonna be all right.

357
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,400
Deep breath.

358
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:43,160
That's it. That's it.

359
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:19,640
Matt. Matt.

360
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:20,880
Hey, Mattie.

361
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:27,040
Matt.

362
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:37,800
Matt.

363
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:49,880
- Matt!
- Matt!

364
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:51,840
- Matt!
- Matthew!

365
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,720
Matt! Matt!

366
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:57,640
Matt! Mattie!

367
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:59,840
Matt!

368
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:05,080
There he is. Mattie!

369
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:10,160
No! Go! Go!

370
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:16,880
My fucking leg's gone!
No! Go! No!

371
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:21,120
My leg's gone. You gotta...
No, you gotta go!

372
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:23,240
- You gotta leave me!
- It's OK, it's OK.

373
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:26,240
- Swim. I'm useless to you.
- No, you're coming with us.

374
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:29,480
- Mattie, it's OK.
- He's gonna... He's gonna come back.

375
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:32,600
Mattie, Mattie, Look at me.
It's OK. Just stay with me.

376
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:37,280
- Quick, before he... before he...
- No, no, no. No, no, no.

377
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:39,760
Mattie. Mattie.

378
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:48,960
Matt. Mattie.

379
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:51,880
Matt. Matt, come on, come on.

380
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:56,080
Wake up. Wake up.
Please wake up. Wake up.

381
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:57,320
Wake up, wake up.

382
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:02,760
Come on. Mattie, wake up!

383
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:05,280
Wake up! Please wake up!

384
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:09,000
Wake up. Please.

385
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,600
Katie!

386
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,720
Katie, get out of there now!

387
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:19,600
Oh, God. I love you.

388
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,720
Katie!

389
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:26,240
- Come on!
- Oh, God. I love you.

390
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:12,080
Hey.

391
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:16,280
Come on.

392
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:18,400
Come on. Come on.

393
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:21,480
Come on.

394
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:02,000
- Did you say something?
- No.

395
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:05,240
- What?
- You said something.

396
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:19,320
It's gonna come back, isn't it?

397
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:24,880
Isn't it?

398
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:29,480
Didn't you say
we'd be there in three hours?

399
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,920
How are we gonna get there now?

400
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:36,000
We're lost in the middle of the ocean
in the middle of the fucking night!

401
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:39,440
- Suzie...
- We never should have listened to you.

402
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:41,800
We should have stayed on the boat
with Warren.

403
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,360
And now Matt's dead!
And soon we're gonna be too!

404
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:48,720
- We're fucked! We're so fucked!
- Suzie!

405
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:50,720
We're so...

406
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:58,520
I'm sorry about Matt.

407
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:03,920
And I'm sorry about all of this.

408
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:10,040
Luke, it's not your fault.

409
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:12,800
It's not your fault.

410
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,560
You didn't make us come with you.

411
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:22,240
It's all right.

412
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:26,320
It's all right. Hey.

413
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:29,840
It's all right.

414
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:36,080
What was that?

415
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:56,640
Oh, my God.
Come together. Come together.

416
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:02,200
Oh, my God!

417
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:05,040
I don't wanna die!
I don't wanna die!

418
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:07,600
Please! Help us!

419
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:11,520
Oh, God, somebody help us!

420
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:17,520
Hey.

421
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:24,600
- Hey.
- Look.

422
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:31,280
Oh. Hey.

423
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:34,520
Suze.

424
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:37,560
Look.

425
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:00,400
Whoo!

426
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:16,960
OK, be careful, huh? It's very sharp.

427
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:49,120
Oh, it's so good to be out of the water.

428
01:01:57,320 --> 01:02:01,280
It's not Turtle Is land, but it's land.

429
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:14,240
Let's keep going, then.

430
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,360
Yeah.

431
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:37,880
- Oh, I'm so sore.
- Me too.

432
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:11,560
What?

433
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:12,880
I don't know.

434
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:34,080
Get back.

435
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:44,880
Oh! It's a fucking dolphin.

436
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:11,320
Moving pretty fast.
The current must have picked up.

437
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:14,400
Finally the current is helping.

438
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:29,080
Is that the dolphin?

439
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:04,000
Suzie! Suzie!

440
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:08,400
Suzie!

441
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:19,560
Oh, fuck.

442
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:26,400
It's OK. Come on.

443
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:31,280
Come on.

444
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:56,240
Oh, my God.

445
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:00,640
Poor Suzie.

446
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:18,880
It's the same one, isn't it?

447
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:22,720
I think so.

448
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:25,320
It is. I know it is.

449
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:46,080
There's some more reef.
I think we should go.

450
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:36,560
Luke! Luke!

451
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:37,840
Luke!

452
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:41,160
Luke! Luke!

453
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:09,960
Come on. Come on.

454
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:12,120
Come on, Luke.

455
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:38,000
Come on. Come on, let's go.

456
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:40,560
I... No.

457
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:55,480
- You OK?
- Yeah.

458
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:12,120
My... My foot, it's bleeding.

459
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:17,680
Oh, shit.

460
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:34,480
Sorry.

461
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:47,040
Thanks.

462
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:50,200
It's OK.

463
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:54,240
I love you, Luke.

464
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:02,440
I love you too.

465
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:27,280
- You ready?
- No.

466
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:31,160
Me neither.

467
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:35,200
Let's go.

468
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,640
Swim. Fucking swim!

469
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:24,880
Come on, babe.

470
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:27,200
Come on.

471
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:30,760
Come on! Go!

472
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:32,520
Come on!

473
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:34,840
Go! Go!

474
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:46,400
Pull me up! Pull me up!

475
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:49,000
Take me! Take me!

476
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:50,400
Pull me up! Pull me up!

477
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:53,680
Come on. I can't!

478
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:57,280
- Come on! Come on!
