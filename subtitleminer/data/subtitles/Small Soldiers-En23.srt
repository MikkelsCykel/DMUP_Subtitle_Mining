{1490}{1572}GloboTech Industries, long recognized|as the worldwide leader...
{1574}{1656}...in high-tech weaponry,|is now reaching even higher.
{1658}{1717}Under the leadership of CEO, Gil Mars...
{1720}{1837}...GloboTech engineers are blazing the trail|into tomorrow"s most exciting sector.
{1845}{1904}Introducing advanced|battlefield technology...
{1906}{1972}...into consumerproducts|for the whole family.
{1974}{2068}For the first time, you and yours will enjoy|the same high quality standards...
{2070}{2173}...as demanded by the Defense Department,|atprivate sectorprices.
{2175}{2290}GloboTech, turning swords into plowshares|foryou and your family.
{2905}{2962}He's here. He's early.
{2965}{3035}He's not supposed to be here yet.|He said...
{3063}{3108}Slamfist optimal. Good. Check.
{3143}{3182}Chickens.
{3207}{3250}Let me help you with these.
{3275}{3305}Pretty exciting, huh?
{3307}{3389}I don't know. I think it's kind of sad.
{3392}{3470}Heartland Toys has a long tradition|of bringing joy to kids.
{3473}{3524}Gil Mars won't care about that.
{3526}{3573}He's just going to care about profits.
{3575}{3603}I think it sucks.
{3605}{3677}Welcome to Earth. You may not be|familiar with our customs...
{3680}{3749}...but things work like this down here,|in the real world.
{3751}{3794}Well, the real world sucks.
{3797}{3846}It does have its perks.
{3874}{3985}Gentlemen, I'm Ms. Kegel,|executive assistant to Mr. Mars.
{4046}{4116}Let me be the first to welcome you|to the GloboTech family.
{4118}{4252}Just as he's done with his computer,|telecommunications and food divisions...
{4255}{4349}...Mr. Mars intends to bring his own|personal touch to Heartland Play Systems.
{4366}{4392}Well, that's good.
{4491}{4526}All right.
{4546}{4574}These are...
{4602}{4639}Where's everybody else?
{4641}{4690}There is no longer any "everybody else".
{4692}{4741}Mr. Mars, it's an honor-
{4744}{4818}Cut the kiss-ass.|After I leave, I won't remember your name.
{4820}{4850}This is Irwin Wayfair.
{4863}{4937}I'm told you two are responsible for this.
{4940}{5020}Yes, sir. That's Flatchoo,|he's part of the Belch Brigade.
{5024}{5083}Actually, the whole line was Irwin's idea.
{5167}{5286}Once I did the marketing, it was the most|successful product in company history.
{5288}{5372}That's why I bought the place|and why you two are still onboard.
{5377}{5438}So, let's talk about the future.
{5597}{5697}Okay, these are Gorgonites. They...|Hi. How are you today?
{5699}{5725}I'm late.
{5742}{5818}Okay. I drew up some pictures.
{5822}{5873}That's a picture you can have.
{5921}{5997}All right, these are Gorgonites.
{6000}{6026}And this one.
{6029}{6119}This is Archer.|He's the grand, noble leader of...
{6131}{6192}Okay, and Troglokhan...
{6194}{6262}...the navigator who navigates.
{6267}{6370}Okay, they're monsters|from the land of Gorgon.
{6373}{6447}They've come to our world and are lost.|To return to Gorgon...
{6450}{6517}...they have to learn all about our world.
{6519}{6589}This way, kids can learn and do research-
{6591}{6646}Excuse me. Did you say "learn"?
{6658}{6693}Learn, yeah.
{6719}{6735}Next.
{6772}{6806}Mr. Mars...
{6834}{6898}...let me introduce you to...
{6951}{6987}...Major...
{7053}{7137}...Chip Hazard,|leader of the Commando Elite.
{7212}{7284}It's called multimedia, Irwin. Look into it.
{7366}{7421}The future is here.
{7432}{7487}A new age has dawned...
{7520}{7567}...for action!
{7745}{7825}The world"s most awesome|high-tech fighting force...
{7827}{7911}...is ready to battle for|the next millennium.
{7915}{7964}Chip Hazard, reporting for duty!
{7967}{8006}Wait. Hold on.
{8028}{8102}Hold on, hold on. Can they really do that?
{8112}{8169}- Do what?|- Punch out of the box.
{8190}{8210}No.
{8224}{8259}I didn't think so.
{8261}{8341}There's a disclaimer.|Legal says we're completely covered.
{8351}{8392}You know what I'm sick of?
{8407}{8487}Commercials showing trucks|popping up on Mount Rushmore...
{8490}{8541}...and parking on Abraham Lincoln's head.
{8544}{8630}And shampoo commercials that say|women can look like Claudia Schiffer...
{8633}{8694}...after one cycle of rinse and repeat.
{8703}{8764}What if these toys actually could talk?
{8766}{8846}What if they could walk?|What if they could actually kick ass?
{8857}{8879}Nick Nitro.
{8899}{8968}Toys that are so smart|when kids play with them...
{8970}{9003}...they play back.
{9005}{9091}Toys that actually do what they do|in the commercials.
{9107}{9152}That's an interesting idea.
{9154}{9201}Forget the "Batteries not included" crap.
{9203}{9260}Put in a lifetime GloboTech lithium cell.
{9262}{9338}They'll run forever.|That'll piss off the guys at Eveready.
{9377}{9478}How's this slogan? "The Commando Elite.|Anything else is just a toy. "
{9484}{9535}"Everything else is just a toy. "
{9539}{9588}That's good, too. Sure.
{9593}{9617}Sir?
{9642}{9736}You know, that kind of computing power|doesn't really seem feasible-
{9739}{9831}Irwin, we're part of GloboTech.|We can find the technology.
{9836}{9961}Our missiles can find a bastard 7,000 miles|away and stick a warhead up his ass.
{9965}{10055}This won't be a problem. They're soldiers.|What do soldiers need?
{10070}{10121}- Hats?|- Camouflage?
{10145}{10173}Ms. Kegel?
{10177}{10199}Enemies, sir.
{10202}{10299}Enemies. See, these hideous,|ugly freaks are the enemy...
{10301}{10365}...and our guys have to find them|and vaporize them.
{10375}{10441}No, they're not... Sir?
{10471}{10522}Don't you think that's a bit violent?
{10524}{10594}Exactly. So call it action, not violence.
{10598}{10653}Kids love action. It sells.
{10656}{10748}Besides, what are you worried about?|They're only toys.
{10823}{10925}I can't believe this. This is really wrong.
{10928}{11014}It's a total perversion of everything|I designed these Gorgonites to be!
{11017}{11076}Can it, Irwin. This is a golden opportunity.
{11078}{11149}If we pull this off,|Mars will be eating out of our hands.
{11151}{11186}By the way, gentlemen...
{11188}{11268}...Mr. Mars expects the product|ready for shipment in three months.
{11271}{11299}Three months?
{11302}{11384}No. It takes at least six months.
{11388}{11437}There's product testing and focus-
{11440}{11514}Three months is fine.|Tell Mr. Mars they'll be ready then.
{11516}{11549}All right, then.
{11563}{11602}These are your security cards.
{11604}{11696}They give you unlimited access|to all top-secret Globo technology.
{11703}{11820}And these are your individual,|secret passwords. Memorize them now.
{11898}{11930}Mine's "Gizmo. "
{11936}{11983}I said "secret. "
{12152}{12236}Password. Password.|What's my password?
{12364}{12392}Gizmo.
{12490}{12529}Let's find us some chips.
{12622}{12669}Some really good chips.
{12726}{12769}A lot of really good chips.
{12908}{12946}The X1000.
{12986}{13031}Hello, Mr. Chips.
{16071}{16155}This looks like a nice store.|Look at those toys.
{16157}{16237}Come on, Grandma.|This place never has anything good.
{16922}{16958}Hey, Alan.
{17012}{17055}How's the world treating you?
{17058}{17129}- You, Joe, are the highlight of my day.|- Jeez, tough break, kid.
{17143}{17215}- New truck?|- New owner. See?
{17291}{17361}Soon everything will be owned|by one giant corporation.
{17369}{17416}Then, it's good-bye microbreweries.
{17425}{17474}So, where's your dad? I got his order.
{17477}{17540}He's going out of town tonight|for a seminar.
{17548}{17601}Wait a second. He left you in charge?
{17606}{17672}I was as surprised as you.
{17674}{17768}I think he's starting to trust me again.|Or maybe he didn't have a choice.
{17794}{17835}What's the seminar?
{17841}{17913}"How to make a success|of your small business. "
{17923}{17966}I suggested torching the place.
{17968}{18070}Not a good idea. Arson forensics|nowadays are very sophisticated.
{18202}{18249}"Gorgonites and Commando Elite. "
{18284}{18310}What are those?
{18364}{18392}Let's find out.
{18617}{18649}Ten-hut!
{18677}{18741}Major Chip Hazard, reporting for duty, sir!
{18782}{18837}Wow. Voice activated. Not bad.
{18859}{18949}They move, they talk.|They got a built-in, two-way radio.
{18965}{19043}"Buy a second commando|and communicate with a friend. "
{19142}{19183}Halt! Who goes there?
{19203}{19285}Greetings. I am Archer,|emissary of the Gorgonites.
{19349}{19396}Awfully polite for a monster.
{19405}{19479}You never have to replace the battery.|That's a good thing.
{19519}{19607}Hey, Joe. Do you think you could|front me a set of these?
{19622}{19634}What?
{19644}{19711}Sort of lend them to me.|You got plenty in the truck.
{19759}{19812}That's Toy World's inventory|for the month.
{19814}{19859}This order's paid for.
{19861}{19904}I'll pay you back after I sell them.
{19906}{19959}What about your dad's policy, no war toys?
{19961}{20053}Don't worry about my dad.|By the time he gets back, they'll be sold.
{20055}{20104}And we'll have made some money for once.
{20155}{20191}I don't know.
{20214}{20265}You're saying that never in your career...
{20272}{20335}...has anything just fallen off|the back of the truck?
{20337}{20384}I don't like your tone.
{20387}{20405}Sorry.
{20415}{20445}It's too loud.
{20491}{20542}Okay, one whole set.
{20553}{20610}I'll lose the paperwork someplace.
{20614}{20692}- I had better not regret this.|- You won't. I swear.
{20695}{20746}And you've got to get them off the truck.
{20764}{20836}- I could getin trouble for this.|- No one will know.
{20840}{20926}They better not. These toys don"t go|on sale officially until Monday.
{20929}{21007}I could loose myjob.|I could loose my house.
{21413}{21464}Thanks, Joe. I owe you one.
{21479}{21514}You owe me twelve.
{21568}{21606}Good luck, kid.
{22061}{22097}Freeze!
{22647}{22696}I wanted to go to Toy World.
{22698}{22767}Life is full of disappointments.|Go look around.
{22801}{22875}His birthday's next week.|Mom said I had to take him shopping.
{22882}{22939}Great. What kind of stuff is he into?
{22961}{23051}Dinosaurs, mutants.|Anything that maims, kills or destroys.
{23065}{23093}I just got in-
{23096}{23178}You're Alan Abernathy.|You moved into the house behind mine.
{23191}{23229}I've heard about you.
{23233}{23272}- You have?|- Yeah.
{23303}{23360}How come I never see you after school?
{23380}{23416}I'm kind of stuck here.
{23423}{23466}What kind of toy store is this?
{23478}{23545}It's my dad. He thinks these toys are cool.
{23558}{23601}Too bad nobody else does.
{23629}{23705}The Commando Elite will rid the Earth|of the Gorgonites.
{23726}{23796}The Gorgonites are peaceful.|We mean no harm.
{23806}{23896}Gorgonite, you are a hideous freak.|You will be vaporized.
{23925}{23996}Civilian, declare your allegiance.
{24037}{24061}Cool.
{24077}{24124}I know what I want!
{24126}{24245}I want the soldier! They're walking|and fighting and they're so cool!
{24305}{24331}Where'd they go?
{24398}{24437}What about this one?
{24439}{24486}No, I want the other one.
{24495}{24554}Major Chip Hazard. He's the one.
{24557}{24600}- How much are these?|- A lot.
{24603}{24656}Mom and Dad won't buy you one of these.
{24659}{24739}Yes, they will.|They buy you those stupid Gwendy dolls.
{24748}{24789}All right, Timmy.
{24834}{24881}Save me one of the buff guys.
{24884}{24943}- And a monster, too.|- I don't think so, brat.
{24946}{25032}- I'll find it and hold it till tomorrow.|- How about the flame-thrower?
{25074}{25166}- When will I get that toy?|- Never, if you don't shut up.
{25243}{25286}Say "hi" once in a while.
{25850}{25917}- Meet death with honor, coward.|- There you are.
{26108}{26167}Congratulations. You're practically sold.
{26211}{26250}You, I'm not so sure about.
{26367}{26406}Troglokhan.
{26537}{26569}Punch-it.
{26646}{26693}Oh, man! Dad's ticket!
{26797}{26852}Okay, suitcase...
{26854}{26922}...briefcase, keys. Keys.|Where are my keys?
{26927}{26966}Right where you left them.
{26969}{27012}And where did I leave them?
{27090}{27149}What is wrong with me? What else?
{27152}{27197}Stuart, please, try to relax.
{27199}{27296}Remember why we moved here.|To get away from the stress.
{27307}{27354}To eliminate the stress.
{27362}{27398}To...
{27403}{27446}...exhale...
{27466}{27504}...the stress.
{27603}{27699}Mom! I know what I want for my birthday.|I want a Major Chip Hazard.
{27709}{27768}- Don't upset your father.|- Hi, Dad.
{27770}{27811}- Hi, sweetie.|- What's up?
{27815}{27866}- Al here was just telling me-|- Ed.
{27870}{27942}He was telling me the angle|of the Earth's tilt on its axis...
{27944}{28015}...relative to the orbit|of the transmission satellite...
{28017}{28099}...restricts the placement|for optimum reception.
{28120}{28153}Yeah.
{28158}{28230}In other words, this tree is in the way.
{28240}{28279}Right. Exactly.
{28307}{28358}No problema.
{28539}{28577}Knock that off!
{28579}{28673}Stuart, dish guy says the tree has to go.|You don't mind, do you?
{28676}{28725}- Yes, I mind!|- What?
{28735}{28846}I said, "yes, I mind!" What the hell|are you doing, Phil? This is my tree!
{28854}{28981}Happy to do the work. What are neighbors|for? Isn't the dish a beauty?
{28983}{29059}No. This tree is beautiful.
{29067}{29138}That dish is just one more piece|of techno-crap...
{29141}{29215}...to go along with the rest|of your stockpile of techno-crap!
{29219}{29309}You're already pulling so much juice,|you got us living in a cancer node.
{29313}{29368}There's never been|any conclusive data linking-
{29370}{29407}Give me that saw, Phil.
{29409}{29489}Stuart, come on.|Airplane now, vendetta later.
{29492}{29590}I'll check the zoning laws,|but I think they'll prove me right.
{29758}{29830}Hasn't he heard of the dishes|that go on top of your house?
{29832}{29873}Maybe they don't get as many channels.
{29876}{29911}He probably got a deal.
{29913}{29927}Dad!
{29980}{30035}Alan, you're supposed to be in the shop.
{30062}{30092}You forgot your ticket.
{30107}{30146}My ticket.
{30149}{30215}Thank you, son. Way to stay heads up.
{30218}{30267}Occasionally I do something right.
{30270}{30300}I'm out of here.
{30302}{30376}- Hurry but drive carefully.|- I'll call you when I get there.
{30389}{30428}Give me a smooch.
{30452}{30507}- Bye-bye. Bye, son.|- See you later, Dad.
{30899}{30971}- The door was locked when you left?|- Yes.
{30975}{31016}Did you empty the cash register?
{31019}{31091}Both quarters and all six pennies.|And I shut off the lights.
{31094}{31118}Just asking.
{31120}{31206}It's possible I make it through|the entire day without screwing up.
{31797}{31829}What the...
{31955}{32006}How the heck did you get in here?
{32278}{32362}What was it? Halt! Who goes there?
{32380}{32482}Greetings. I am Archer,|emissary of the Gorgonites.
{32502}{32538}Sure you are.
{32565}{32624}Beware. There will be no mercy.
{32628}{32664}Is that so?
{32672}{32731}Beware. There will be no mercy.
{32742}{32811}I'll be real careful. Thanks for the advice.
{32897}{32999}Greetings. I am Archer,|emissary of the Gorgonites.
{33011}{33049}What is your name?
{33063}{33139}I'm Alan. Now shut up.|I have to do my homework.
{33182}{33229}Greetings, Alan-now-shut-up.
{33261}{33295}What did you say?
{33356}{33403}You just said my name, didn't you?
{33508}{33538}Didn't you?
{34983}{35036}Commandos! Ten-hut!
{35099}{35150}Commando Elite, fall in!
{35507}{35543}Sound off, soldiers!
{35545}{35623}Butch Meathook, sniper.|Lethal from any distance, sir!
{35626}{35659}Good to have you aboard.
{35661}{35733}Nick Nitro. Demolition is my mission.
{35736}{35787}I served with your father.|He was a good man.
{35790}{35874}Brick Bazooka, artillery.|Ready to go full bore, sir!
{35876}{35906}Save it for the enemy.
{35909}{36001}Link Static, communications.|Awaiting orders, sir!
{36003}{36056}Double up on your rations, Sparky.
{36059}{36157}Kip Killagin, covert insurgent.|Sharp as a razor, sir!
{36160}{36209}Let me see that weapon.
{36253}{36308}Standard issue is insufficient.
{36311}{36370}All right, ladies, now listen good.
{36376}{36464}Our mission:|Destroy the Gorgonite enemy. Defeat him!
{36466}{36498}Yes, sir!
{36504}{36563}There will be no mercy.
{36575}{36682}Search the area and secure new arms.|Commandos, fall out!
{38506}{38555}Gorgon.
{39191}{39232}What the heck are you?
{39328}{39387}You're not like any toy I've ever seen.
{39425}{39474}Come on, speak up.
{39505}{39641}Greetings, Alan-now-shut-up.|I am Archer, emissary of the Gorgonites.
{39667}{39724}I think you're smarter|than you're letting on.
{39735}{39852}I bet you're smart enough to get my name|right. It's Alan. Just Alan. Got it?
{39889}{39928}Greetings, Alan.
{39934}{40006}I knew it. Walk to the end of the table.
{40083}{40116}Don't play dumb with me.
{40119}{40160}You know what I'm saying.
{40498}{40545}Alan, friend of Archer.
{40550}{40636}Defender of all Gorgonites.|Keeper of Encarta.
{40647}{40694}Keeper of Encarta?
{40741}{40788}You were using my computer?
{40813}{40885}If I find a virus in there,|you're headed for the microwave.
{40909}{40973}Beware. There will be no mercy.
{41012}{41047}Are you threatening me?
{41049}{41152}The Gorgonites must be free.|There will be no mercy.
{41319}{41442}Soldiers, no poor sap ever won a war|by dying for his country.
{41444}{41520}He won it by being all that he can be.
{41531}{41611}Damn the torpedoes or give me death!
{41615}{41691}Eternal vigilance is the price of duty.
{41693}{41789}And to the victors go the spoils.|So, remember...
{41791}{41881}...you are the best of the best|of the few and the proud!
{41885}{41942}So, ask not what your country|can do for you...
{41945}{42021}...only regret that you have|but one life to live.
{42037}{42109}The war against the Gorgonites|will be won!
{42157}{42239}Commando Elite, let the first shot be fired!
{42241}{42317}Search out the Gorgonites|and frag them all!
{42320}{42363}Attack!
{42393}{42429}Get him! Jump on him!
{42431}{42478}Plastic at twelve o"clock!
{42581}{42645}Archer, where are you, anyway?
{42745}{42811}I am in so much trouble.
{42831}{42884}There will be no mercy.
{42947}{42988}This is what you meant?
{43011}{43066}How could toys do this?
{43212}{43263}Alas, poor Troglokhan.
{43266}{43362}I'm sorry, Archer.|That's all the pieces I could find.
{43389}{43467}The Commando Elite|have destroyed Troglokhan.
{43475}{43563}What about the other Gorgonites?|And where are the Commandos?
{43764}{43842}Hi. We're closed. See the sign?
{43847}{43917}I'll be quick. I just came for Major Chip|and the monster.
{43919}{43964}I can't sell you them. Sorry.
{43966}{44029}But you're the only store that has them.
{44031}{44070}The toys are gone, all right?
{44086}{44125}Well, what about him?
{44181}{44253}Him. He's defective...
{44279}{44338}...and the rest were stolen.
{44342}{44381}That's too bad.
{44443}{44471}Alan...
{44474}{44513}...we must find the-
{44550}{44595}Oh, my God.
{44631}{44674}Who did this?
{44765}{44820}Are you pulling|some kind of insurance scam?
{44849}{44956}I swear, I did one thing wrong.|That's it! And I'm branded for life.
{44971}{45010}So, it is true.
{45036}{45141}I heard your parents moved here because|you got kicked out of ten different schools.
{45144}{45174}I did not.
{45182}{45216}No?
{45383}{45413}It was two.
{45416}{45452}Only two.
{45598}{45626}So...
{45658}{45697}...you need some help?
{45739}{45808}- Alan, can I talk now?|- No.
{45874}{45935}I can't believe they broke my dad's radio.
{45995}{46054}Do you ever watch that show,|Family of Five?
{46056}{46084}Sure.
{46087}{46119}You like it?
{46133}{46157}It's okay.
{46159}{46235}Thank God! Me, neither.|I hate it. It's so lame.
{46238}{46279}I'm sick of hearing it's so great.
{46282}{46335}I can't stand the parents. They're so nice.
{46338}{46422}- The worst. Where do these go?|- Over there.
{46477}{46545}I'm more of an X-Files guy myself.
{46554}{46605}"The truth is out there," Alan.
{46653}{46688}You like Led Zeppelin?
{46690}{46741}Yeah, they're the greatest.
{46759}{46800}They're my favorite band.
{46836}{46902}You're not like other girls.
{46917}{46951}I know.
{47132}{47220}I can't believe we've finished.|It took less time than I thought.
{47240}{47283}And the boat looks great.
{47289}{47359}It wasn't that messed up.|The mast was the hardest part.
{47361}{47397}He'll never know.
{47440}{47495}So, what did you do?
{47550}{47626}Come on, Alan.|I've heard the story ten times already.
{47630}{47696}Don't deny it. They say|you're a real terror.
{47703}{47767}Yeah, that's me, a real terror.
{47787}{47869}I did some graffiti, flooded|the faculty bathroom. Stuff like that.
{47874}{47942}My shrink told my parents|I was "acting out. "
{47956}{48020}I heard you called a bomb scare|on Parents' Day.
{48022}{48071}That's when I got caught.
{48073}{48105}Bummer.
{48119}{48160}I got put on probation for a while.
{48163}{48241}But that was a long time ago.|I'm a totally different person now.
{48260}{48284}Sure.
{48288}{48320}No, really.
{48324}{48362}Hey, Alan, how's it going?
{48407}{48431}Dad.
{48433}{48519}I was on my way home from the airport.|I thought I'd stop to say hello.
{48533}{48594}- And check up on me?|- And check up on you.
{48605}{48673}Of course. That's my job.|Me Dad, you son, right?
{48697}{48752}- This is Christy.|- Hi.

{48988}{49020}Really?
{49080}{49133}Then, how do you explain this?
{49138}{49197}I was dusting it and it fell over.
{49200}{49266}Dusting with what, a croquet mallet?
{49296}{49335}I should go.
{49337}{49390}I almost forgot my stuff.
{49484}{49525}Bye, Alan.
{49605}{49652}You go home, too. I'll close up.
{49658}{49750}- I can do it.|- Obviously you can't. Go home.
{50071}{50120}I'm really sorry about that.
{50122}{50216}I have parents, too.|If that's all he sees, you got off lucky.
{50228}{50279}- Here are your toys.|- Thanks.
{50336}{50412}What happened? I thought|you were coming by practice today.
{50415}{50470}Sorry. Something else came up.
{50480}{50564}I know you. You're the kid|who set his old school on fire, right?
{50572}{50619}Yeah, just to watch it burn.
{50630}{50658}Whatever.
{50668}{50760}We got a scrimmage with the JV.|Come on, you can cheer me on.
{50776}{50804}Great.
{50960}{50996}See you later.
{51096}{51126}Let's see...
{51196}{51232}What do I need?

{59913}{60016}These things go on sale Monday.|How did this kid get hold of them?
{60019}{60115}It's industrial espionage.|I got two words for you: Counter suit.
{60124}{60181}One word: Countersuit. Two words.
{60184}{60235}It's two words, Larry!
{60250}{60297}What if this kid's telling the truth?
{60300}{60378}We can't have toys out on the market|that may be dangerous.
{60383}{60453}How can they be dangerous?|Everything on them is standard.
{60455}{60525}The design is standard,|the materials are standard...
{60527}{60582}...the mechanicals are standard.|Even the...
{60590}{60614}Oh.

{60661}{60677}What?
{60680}{60737}- You just said, "Oh. "|- No, I said, "Oh. "
{60739}{60805}"Oh" like, "That's interesting"|or like, "We're screwed"?
{60807}{60860}No. I mean, hey, whoa, oh.
{60884}{60962}Forget the "Oh". I'll go to legal|to start on the countersuit.
{60965}{61003}The chips!
{61019}{61057}That's the "Oh. "
{61078}{61121}These microprocessing chips.
{61124}{61191}What do they do|and where did you get them from?
{61193}{61298}They microprocess. And they come from|the land of I Saved Your Job.
{61457}{61521}They were designed|for the Defense Department.
{61539}{61607}You put munitions chips in toys?

{62010}{62055}Where are you?
{62134}{62187}Beware. There will be no mercy.
{62251}{62323}We"re lost. We need to find our homeland.
{62329}{62361}Yeah, our homeland.
{62439}{62500}We"re in trouble. Please find us.
{62518}{62569}You"ve got to help us find Goron.
{62571}{62593}Goron?
{62596}{62639}It"s "Gorgon", moron.

{63497}{63567}I am Archer, emissary of the Gorgonites.
{63570}{63598}Archer?
{63627}{63703}Where are the rest of the Gorgonite scum?
{63711}{63775}We have ways of making you talk.
{63851}{63922}Make it easy on yourself.|Ifyou tell us, we"ll letyou go.
{63924}{63981}It will go easier foryou ifyou cooperate.
{63999}{64062}I am Archer, emissary of the Gorgonites.
{64064}{64136}All right. Let"s dispose of this garbage.

{65428}{65483}Alan, what the hell is going on here?
{65523}{65543}Medic!
{65546}{65595}Alan, your hand! What happened?
{65601}{65683}How did you cut your hand?|And what are you doing down here?
{65707}{65771}Mom, Dad, it's okay.
{65841}{65908}While you were gone,|I bought some soldier toys from Joe.
{65910}{65967}I figured I could sell them|before you got back.
{65969}{66039}And for once, I would have made|the store a little money.
{66041}{66109}I know it was the wrong thing to do.|I'm sorry.
{66133}{66172}There, I said it.
{66249}{66281}Okay.
{66305}{66401}I think it's very honest of you|to tell the truth.
{66415}{66520}So, you pawned my woodworking tools|so you could pay Joe?
{66523}{66593}No! I'm pretty sure the toys took them.
{66599}{66623}What?
{66632}{66662}The toys.
{66697}{66754}Are you trying to upset me?
{66756}{66832}I mean, are you deliberately making-
{66837}{66911}- What was the word? Projected-|- Aggression.
{66913}{66966}- Projected aggression-|- It's not aggression!
{66969}{67053}It's these toys!|It's like they're alive. Look.
{67105}{67156}Come on, Archer. Back me up here.
{67205}{67237}Say something.
{67259}{67314}Halt! Who goes there? Talk to me!
{67317}{67368}Alan, please.
{67389}{67467}I need to ask you this. Are you on crank?
{67472}{67492}No!
{67494}{67586}Then is it crystal meth, tar, smack?|We need to know!
{67588}{67658}No, I'm not on drugs! It's these soldiers!
{67661}{67710}All right, that's it! Stop it.
{67722}{67765}I mean, Alan...
{67774}{67806}...I am...
{67837}{67874}...at a loss.
{67975}{68043}You! Why didn't you say anything?
{68049}{68133}Shut up! Don"t talk to me! Not a word!
{68137}{68201}Wise guy. I should shred the bunch of you.
{68224}{68298}My dad thinks I'm insane.|Christy thinks I'm an idiot...
{68300}{68392}...and when Joe finds out|I can't pay him back, he'll break my legs.
{68405}{68460}The Gorgonites are not destroyed.
{68480}{68500}What?
{68505}{68634}Major Hazard seeks the location of the|Gorgonite scum. They are not destroyed.
{68655}{68743}'Cause if the Commandos destroyed them|they wouldn't be looking for them.
{68785}{68844}All right, where are they?
{68855}{68939}My Gorgonite brothers are doing|what the Gorgonites do best:
{68945}{68984}They are hiding.
{69201}{69238}Commando Elite, fall in!
{69241}{69288}Sir! Yes, sir!
{69325}{69407}We have met the enemy.|He is big. He is fast.
{69409}{69479}He has allied himself|with the Gorgonite scum.
{69485}{69587}The rules of engagement have changed.|Private Static!
{69619}{69647}Damn!
{69747}{69794}This place is a gold mine.
{69801}{69875}Holy smokes. Look at all this hardware.
{69905}{69956}Technological superiority.
{69962}{70005}Dibs on the chain saw.
{70190}{70227}Falling in, sir.
{70345}{70369}Out of the way.
{70458}{70561}It's only a flesh wound, sir.
{70573}{70638}Rest easy. You've done your job.
{70657}{70712}Did we win?
{70753}{70781}We will.
{70812}{70871}Nick Nitro's battery has run out.
{70877}{70973}But his memory will keep going|and going and going.
{70981}{71045}His death will be avenged.
{71153}{71235}Commandos, secure the perimeter!|Tap all communications!
{71241}{71313}Roll some armor! We got us a war to win.
{71316}{71388}If it launches, lacerates or detonates...
{71391}{71452}...I want it mobile and I want it lethal!
{71457}{71490}Sir! Yes, sir!
{71657}{71710}They're not in the storeroom,|they're not here.
{71713}{71772}Monsters shouldn't be hiding|but fighting Commandos.
{71775}{71807}We would lose.
{71813}{71872}It is what we were programmed to do.
{71875}{71959}Hide and lose?|Those are some great options.
{72008}{72076}If I was a Gorgonite, where would I be?
{72081}{72202}I'm hiding because I'm a loser.|I've got zero self-esteem...
{72211}{72260}...and my brain's the size of a peanut.
{72287}{72325}Where would I be?
{72701}{72754}This is so gross.
{72761}{72808}Hello. Is anybody in there?
{72954}{72980}Ocula.
{72993}{73069}- What was that?|- It's the Gorgonites.
{73121}{73153}Ocula.
{73181}{73247}Punch-it. Scratch-it.
{73264}{73328}Great to be back.|But seriously, what a dump.
{73333}{73365}Insaniac.
{73390}{73422}Are you a kid or oil painting?
{73465}{73541}Don't worry, Archer. We was hiding.
{73553}{73585}Slamfist.
{73627}{73659}Troglokhan?
{73713}{73741}We fixed him.
{73743}{73798}We tried to fix him.
{73827}{73859}My dad's radio.
{73862}{73934}Some assembly required.
{73967}{74070}So am I nuts? What"s going on here?|Give me a call, 1-800, talk to me.
{74073}{74101}Freaky.
{74129}{74165}Like Frankenstein.
{74207}{74301}At least you're all here.|Maybe Joe won't break my legs after all.
{74321}{74356}Access approved.
{74366}{74402}Let me get this straight.
{74404}{74511}You used my password to order surplus|military chips that might be dangerous?
{74591}{74630}It's okay.
{74633}{74709}That's supposed to happen.|See? Clean room.
{74721}{74785}Clean. Let's just go in.
{74809}{74837}You okay?
{74870}{74919}That's him. That's Ralph.
{74980}{75025}Who are you? You don't belong here.
{75027}{75107}I'm Larry Benson. You supplied|my division with some microchips.
{75110}{75174}Yes. Larry Benson.
{75193}{75312}The X1000. Worked out better|than you dreamed, didn't they?
{75330}{75387}Actually, there was a little problem.
{75416}{75463}Then it's with your software.
{75473}{75559}I don't think there's a problem|with the software, Ralph.
{75571}{75597}You don't?
{75625}{75699}The X1000 is a masterpiece.
{75731}{75780}Imagine a microchip...
{75782}{75883}...sophisticated enough to control|the guidance systems of ballistic missiles.
{75885}{75984}Imagine it can be used to instantly upgrade|any system it's plugged into.
{75993}{76112}Like a smart drug for machines.|Then, imagine it can learn.
{76129}{76201}What are you talking about?|Artificial intelligence?
{76205}{76252}No. Actual intelligence.
{76264}{76340}No wonder those philistines|at the Pentagon didn't appreciate it.
{76343}{76402}One flaw and they scrap the whole project.
{76422}{76479}So there is a flaw in the chips.
{76527}{76590}They're a little bit sensitive to EMP.
{76593}{76669}EMP? Electromagnetic pulse?
{76673}{76763}The kind generated|by the detonation of a nuclear device.
{76765}{76845}I doubt even the toy industry has become|quite that competitive.
{76855}{76958}They said, "Adequate shielding|wasn't cost effective. "
{76999}{77044}Did the Medici ever tell Michelangelo:
{77047}{77154}"Sorry, Mike, marble's not cost-effective.|Here's a bag of cement"? I think not!
{77194}{77222}Gesundheit.
{77233}{77261}Thank you.
{77265}{77341}There shouldn't be any problem,|just because the chips can learn.
{77347}{77462}Am I not being clear? They learn within|the boundaries of their programming.
{77465}{77551}Whatever the core programming,|the X1000 enhances it.
{77584}{77652}So, if you have a problem,|it's in your software.
{77770}{77846}Quick impression, Jimmy Cagney.|"Top of the world, Ma. "
{77928}{77979}Talk about hampering your career.
{77997}{78025}Grab him!
{78041}{78105}It looks so real, don't it?
{78137}{78169}Hit him.
{78219}{78257}Friend of yours?
{78421}{78474}What am I going to do with you guys?
{78505}{78572}Two hundred and twenty-one.|Two hundred and twenty-two.
{78597}{78640}There goes the record.
{78749}{78835}Not so close. You'll ruin your eye.
{79051}{79077}What are you looking at?
{79097}{79129}I dunno.
{79252}{79288}- Hello?|- Alan?
{79296}{79314}Christy?
{79339}{79377}Are you grounded?
{79379}{79430}No, my dad cooled off.
{79440}{79464}So, we did it.
{79473}{79569}Yeah, and the best part is,|I found all those lost toys.
{79585}{79617}You were really a big help.
{79631}{79663}Cool.
{79712}{79751}So, Alan, boxers or briefs?
{79753}{79794}Get those off your head.
{79801}{79840}Hey, what"s going on?
{79865}{79893}Nothing.
{79929}{80003}Listen, I was thinking maybe|we should celebrate sometime.
{80005}{80056}Go to a movie or something.
{80063}{80170}Alan, I only date older guys.|It's nothing personal.
{80239}{80321}What I mean is,|officially I"m going out with Brad.
{80323}{80411}What about unofficially? Or superficially?
{80427}{80546}There is one guy. But he"s kind of|a smart aleck and a bit of a troublemaker.
{80588}{80660}I"m sure he"d be willing|to give it all up foryou.
{80669}{80712}I know I would.
{80733}{80761}Alan.
{80966}{81007}It's party time!
{81203}{81246}One phat ride!
{81333}{81456}Transmission intercepted. The Gorgonites|are bivouacked at the enemy stronghold.
{81459}{81533}And the enemy has revealed|an age-old weakness.
{81536}{81626}I"m sure he"d be willing to give it all up|foryou. I know I would.
{81629}{81682}Put yourself in for a commendation.
{81712}{81771}Soldiers! We have|a window of opportunity.
{81774}{81860}We will exploit it, drown the enemy out|and crush the Gorgonites!
{81873}{81984}We must go behind enemy lines|to secure a hostage. Prepare to move out.
{81999}{82044}Hop it, jarheads!
{82137}{82217}I guess you guys are safe|as long as you stay here.
{82298}{82331}What are you looking for?
{82333}{82361}Gorgon.
{82390}{82437}This is a national park.
{82439}{82511}The Isle of Gorgon is our homeland.
{82517}{82568}Will you help us find it?
{82581}{82634}I don't think you will find it in there.
{82637}{82663}Alan...
{82669}{82761}...if Gorgon is not in that window,|is it in this one?
{82828}{82877}There's nothing in windows.
{82883}{82959}There's stuff outside them.
{82973}{83001}What stuff?
{83007}{83042}You know, outside.
{83045}{83100}Trees, power poles...
{83135}{83174}...Christy's house.
{83181}{83220}And beyond that?
{83249}{83286}The mall.
{83297}{83336}And beyond that?
{83341}{83373}The highway.
{83388}{83420}And beyond that?
{83441}{83492}About a million acres of farm.
{83515}{83556}And what's beyond that?
{83609}{83641}I don't know.
{83715}{83749}Gorgon.
{83820}{83902}Live, via satellite, 257 channels.
{83905}{83960}Closed captioning|for the hearing impaired...
{83962}{84069}...and Dolby stereo where available,|which is right here, right now!
{84109}{84189}What a great picture. It's perfect.
{84196}{84261}I don't know. It looks kind of fuzzy.
{84315}{84358}Let me try something else.
{84416}{84463}Oh, for pete's sake! Phil!
{84539}{84600}Maybe if I tweak the brightness a little.
{84605}{84697}No, it's the chroma.|The flesh tone's way off.
{84745}{84777}Now it's green.
{84780}{84812}Stand down, men.
{84827}{84880}We must neutralize these civilians.
{84882}{84923}I paid a lot. I don't want any ghosts.
{85234}{85260}Follow me.
{85364}{85399}It's a trap, sir.
{85434}{85460}Bring it here, soldier.
{85515}{85549}Chemical warfare.
{85581}{85624}Operation Sandman.
{85771}{85814}Fire when ready, Private.
{85925}{86001}Audie Murphy.|Our most decorated war hero.
{86128}{86187}I think World War ll was my favorite war.
{86319}{86387}No sign of the target, sir. Area is secured.
{86390}{86435}Don't worry. She'll be here.
{86678}{86721}This is where we'll engage the target.
{86723}{86793}Set up concealed positions|and prepare for ambush.
{86803}{86833}Oh, man.
{86844}{86905}I can't believe they got me the whole set.
{86921}{86960}Hold your fire, men.
{86962}{87048}Cool, you can talk.|You must be the leader.
{87080}{87150}Except one day, you get shot.
{87238}{87310}And this guy gets promoted...
{87318}{87382}...and now he's the leader. Yes!
{87387}{87426}It wasn't my idea, Major.
{87430}{87469}Commandos, attack!
{87479}{87518}Pile on the kid!
{87732}{87826}Son, you can be a prisoner or a casualty.|It's up to you.
{87829}{87868}Sir, over here.
{87871}{87916}Oh, man, I hate babysitting.
{87918}{87994}- What is it, soldier?|- Take a look, sir.
{88053}{88108}Bombshells, sir.
{88180}{88219}Fully posable.
{88284}{88339}Hello, dolly!
{88412}{88455}Sweet stuff!
{88464}{88498}Hubba-hubba.
{88537}{88565}R and R, sir?
{88568}{88619}Request a 3-day pass, sir.
{88622}{88741}Denied. Gentlemen, this is the new army.|Those are reinforcements.
{88754}{88834}Bring me the head of Nick Nitro. Move.
{89032}{89096}Soldier, your memory will live on.
{89184}{89208}Damn!
{89219}{89243}Criminy!
{89249}{89292}I think I'm gonna hurl.
{89363}{89416}A mind is a terrible thing to waste.
{90797}{90861}It's alive! It's alive!
{90939}{91042}Hi, there. Cannon Fodder Gwendy,|reporting for duty, sir.
{91062}{91105}Carry on, soldier.
{91216}{91271}I feel your pain.
{91805}{91829}Alan...
{91854}{91907}...the Commando Elite are in the trees.
{91929}{91984}They're not moving|because of the Commandos.
{91986}{92022}It's the wind.
{92042}{92068}See?
{92076}{92119}I see your hand.
{92127}{92199}The wind is blowing. You can feel it.
{92217}{92243}Feel?
{92255}{92339}Right. Plastic. Sorry.
{92367}{92435}It's kind of hard to describe.
{92443}{92508}Weather patterns, wind chill factor.
{92541}{92615}Just because you can't see it,|doesn't mean it doesn't exist.
{92649}{92673}See?
{92772}{92798}Wind.
{92907}{92952}Mom? Dad? I'm home.
{93012}{93042}They're asleep.
{93048}{93128}- You know what that means?|- They could wake up any second.
{93147}{93206}You know, you are such a major hottie.
{93227}{93291}And you are such a major sweet talker.
{93302}{93332}Good night.
{93752}{93854}My bike won't start. I got nowhere to go.|Can I come in?
{93879}{93914}No, that's not it.
{94620}{94684}Don't hate me because I'm beautiful.
{94856}{94897}Let's do something fun.
{94904}{94943}We'll all get facials.
{94952}{95003}Did I overpluck my eyebrows?
{95680}{95735}Now it's our turn to play with you.
{95792}{95835}Let's see if her head comes off.
{95976}{96002}Christy?
{96252}{96311}Look. A man. Alley-oop.
{96336}{96395}Such nice broad shoulders.|Do you work out?
{96411}{96454}What's your sign, big boy?
{96468}{96523}Makeovers are such a blast.
{96554}{96620}That haircut is so five minutes ago.
{96622}{96661}Are you dumping me?
{96710}{96734}Get off!
{96769}{96806}You! Maggot!
{96818}{96888}An officer and a gentleman|does not strike a lady.
{97428}{97466}Are you scared?
{97472}{97519}We're all scared.
{97561}{97629}You'd have to be crazy not to be scared.
{97784}{97812}What?
{97864}{97896}What do you see?
{97974}{98025}Ocula? Are you all right?
{98051}{98098}Settle down. You'll be okay.
{98319}{98360}"Surrender?"
{98416}{98438}Smile, girlie.
{98441}{98509}"Alan, I"m safe. I have not been harmed. "
{98528}{98548}Christy?
{98551}{98643}"I am making this statement of my|own free will and under no duress. "
{98646}{98718}- Yeah, right.|- Stick to the script. Read it as we wrote it.
{98736}{98770}Make itsnappy.
{98772}{98836}"I will be released safely and unharmed...
{98840}{98904}"... only if the following conditions are met:
{98914}{98978}"One: Surrender the Gorgonite scum. "
{99018}{99042}That"s it.
{99045}{99080}Faster, or we stick you.
{99082}{99125}Alan, you have to help.
{99132}{99179}Zoom in. Get those tears.
{99192}{99224}What else is on?
{99366}{99464}If Major Chip Hazard wants a war,|we'll give him a war.
{99512}{99542}Please, Alan, don"t do this.
{99545}{99596}- We"re afraid.|- We"re your friends.
{99604}{99655}- Have mercy.|- You are a traitor.
{99657}{99714}Hi. Welcome to the big cardboard box.
{99746}{99807}We"ll neversee Gorgon again.
{99809}{99883}- Alan seemed so nice.|- Why would he do this to us?
{99886}{99939}Three words, folks. Pu-ber-ty.
{100062}{100162}Enemy contact.|Advance with caution. Roll!
{100184}{100208}Sorry, sir.
{100220}{100308}How could you betray us? We"re free.
{100342}{100414}- Have mercy.|- The Commandos will kill us.
{100419}{100522}Gentlemen, it looks like they blinked.|Advance and envelop.
{100528}{100558}Sir! Yes, sir!
{100563}{100639}Alan, I"m feeling very insecure.
{100652}{100709}I"m allergic to cardboard. Pass it on.
{100946}{100985}Are you ready, Archer?
{101003}{101087}Alan, are you sure this is a good idea?
{101450}{101478}You traitor.
{101481}{101553}- We must be free.|- I don"t feel well.
{101556}{101624}Alan, don"t do it. You"ll be guilt-ridden.
{102243}{102317}My aunt was buried alive.|I"m very claustrophobic.
{102321}{102357}Rock and roll!
{102380}{102423}I love this job!
{102589}{102625}Are you all right?
{102748}{102803}All my make-up is cruelty-free.
{102856}{102892}You come here often?
{102896}{102960}Will you take me to the prom?
{103036}{103108}If you can't accessorize, pulverize.
{103305}{103344}You've been a bad boy.
{103352}{103424}Now you must be punished.
{103501}{103548}Watch out, girls. Hissy fit.
{103602}{103640}You're to die for.
{103653}{103714}Run! She's got a baton!
{103744}{103795}It's a baton death march.
{103818}{103867}She's gone postal!
{104012}{104061}Oh, I broke a nail.
{104067}{104114}I've always hated these things!
{104121}{104155}The humanity!
{104195}{104227}This is it, men.
{104595}{104687}Commandos, the enemy has deployed|a decoy target.
{104689}{104750}Return to primary positions.
{104774}{104813}This is fun!
{104919}{104958}You're killing me!
{105079}{105122}You rescued me.
{105189}{105213}Anytime.
{105278}{105316}Let's go get those creeps.
{105402}{105445}We have to wake my parents.
{105470}{105498}Open fire!
{105630}{105722}We have the enemy on the run.|Exploit and pursue.
{105922}{105987}- You've done this before.|- Once or twice.
{106204}{106234}Watch it.
{106252}{106282}You watch it.
{106398}{106433}We got to get help.
{106612}{106665}Anyone got a garage door opener?
{106970}{107015}Commandos, attack!
{107386}{107424}Time to plant the corn.
{107521}{107589}Expect no mercy, Gorgonite ally!
{107743}{107778}I'll get the bike.
{108170}{108221}Get on! Hurry!
{108535}{108578}Hot pursuit!
{109380}{109406}Interlock!
{109462}{109519}Right side, lock! Left side, lock!
{109591}{109627}Ramming speed!
{110013}{110049}Hold on!
{110631}{110667}They're toast.
{110823}{110870}You think I could drive home?
{110873}{110909}Good idea.
{111333}{111386}- Your kid kidnapped my daughter...|- Uh, oh.
{111388}{111488}...tied up my son and drugged me|and my wife. Marion is still tripping!
{111491}{111534}Time to hide again.
{111544}{111599}Not to mention the damage to my house.
{112241}{112282}We have lost the battle.
{112287}{112351}We will not lose the war.
{112367}{112395}That's the last of them.
{112511}{112609}I think that's all of Friday's delivery.|Why did they want it back?
{112611}{112664}You know the clowns|that make these decisions.
{112667}{112761}They don't care we're standing around|freezing, in the middle of the night...
{112763}{112816}...as long as everyone knows|who's in charge.
{113045}{113081}Corporations.
{113103}{113177}Right hand doesn't know|what the left hand is screwing up.
{113205}{113277}Greetings. You've been drafted.
{113294}{113312}Move!
{113324}{113377}Is this entire household insane?
{113391}{113471}He says that toy is alive|just because it moves a little.
{113476}{113564}What's next? The Blue Fairy|drops by with a talking cricket?
{113573}{113609}He's telling the truth!
{113638}{113683}He's brainwashed you, hasn't he?
{113697}{113812}Don't worry, honey. We'll get you|the best deprogrammer money can buy.
{113817}{113885}You can't change programming.
{113895}{113963}Look. Another one.
{113975}{114065}I told you they were hiding.|It's what they do.
{114088}{114147}That's it. Come on, Christy.
{114151}{114200}Timmy, Marion, we're out of here.
{114233}{114276}Don't be a stranger, Phil.
{114343}{114468}Yes, we're with Heartland Play Systems,|Consumer Satisfaction.
{114472}{114529}Is Alan Abernathy here?
{114531}{114574}That's Alan, right there.
{114588}{114672}How you doing? We understand|you acquired some of our fine products.
{114692}{114749}There's a chance they might be...
{114779}{114803}...defective.
{114805}{114868}But there's no reason to think|they could do any harm.
{114870}{114954}- There's reasons.|- There is a problem with the Commandos.
{114956}{115073}What problem? Bear in mind, you will be|called into court to support your claim.
{115109}{115170}- Your toys nearly killed my son!|- Stuart-
{115173}{115241}Don't say calm down!|Calm was killing me.
{115250}{115324}And you! You owe my son an apology!
{115347}{115427}Hey, Larry. Look. It's Archer.
{115455}{115481}Greetings.
{115483}{115563}I am Archer. Who are you?
{115573}{115637}I'm Irwin. I designed you...
{115643}{115679}...and all the Gorgonites.
{115681}{115715}He's the creator.
{115831}{115870}You're all here.
{115876}{115923}Everyone has to be somewhere.
{115929}{115984}That's true. My mom used to...
{116027}{116115}Making declarative statements?|Formulating inquiries?
{116193}{116238}Lights out.
{116303}{116362}Something's going on out there.
{116469}{116557}That's weird.|There's a Heartland truck outside.
{116873}{116928}- More Commandos?|- A lot more.
{116966}{117032}Dad, come see this for yourself.
{117043}{117075}Chip?
{117108}{117155}Dead Chip? The Chip we killed?
{117162}{117215}Maybe we didn't kill him enough.
{117241}{117280}Oh, my.
{117366}{117404}Commandos, fall out!
{117413}{117509}Secure the leftperimeter!|Secure the rightperimeter! Move out!
{117523}{117553}Sir, yes, sir!
{117557}{117606}Assault formation. Go!
{117703}{117767}If waris hell, let"s give them hell.
{117769}{117857}We didn"tstart this war,|but we"re damn sure going to end it.
{117888}{117931}I'm scared.
{117965}{118033}It'll be all right. They're not after you.
{118044}{118108}They just want to kill|the little monster people.
{118110}{118202}That's right. We're just caught up|in some stupid game.
{118210}{118269}Well, game over.
{118291}{118330}Mr. Fimple, wait.
{118334}{118362}No, Alan.
{118373}{118409}Let him go.
{118529}{118561}Archer.
{118567}{118633}The Gorgonites must lose.
{118736}{118768}Hi!
{118788}{118827}I'm Phil Fimple.
{118852}{118940}I'm here to negotiate the surrender of the...
{118949}{118981}...Gorgonzolas.
{118986}{119045}Here's our proposal: Take them!
{119049}{119115}He's selling us out.|He's an Arnold Benedict.
{119127}{119217}Take them apart, steal their batteries,|whatever it is you...
{119224}{119263}...people do.
{119391}{119442}Is that my JVC?
{119491}{119530}There will be no surrender!
{119533}{119627}There will be no mercy!|All Gorgonite scum must die!
{119658}{119709}Bomb them all the way back to preschool.
{119711}{119779}Recon estimates|Gorgonite scum strength at 16!
{119795}{119863}Sixteen? Where did they get sixteen from?
{119871}{119939}Seven Gorgonites and nine people.
{119988}{120035}Well, you heard our proposal.
{120038}{120081}Phil, get in here! Hurry!
{120093}{120157}These negotiations are over!
{120293}{120357}We are the Commando Elite.|Everything else...
{120365}{120403}...isjust a toy.
{120588}{120668}- What are they doing?|- Psychological warfare.
{120679}{120740}The Marines did this against Noriega.
{120779}{120811}Phil.
{120867}{120918}I love this song!
{121000}{121064}Fimple, turn that off!
{121149}{121202}Go, go!
{121313}{121356}Lock and load.
{121386}{121418}Nail them!
{121430}{121471}Open fire!
{121491}{121517}Get down!
{121772}{121804}Fimple.
{121899}{121923}Honey?
{121964}{122040}Stuart, Phil, barricade that window!|Alan, get back.
{122087}{122126}Get back!
{122266}{122305}Fire!
{122399}{122425}Wow.
{122428}{122460}Fire!
{122466}{122505}How are they-
{122529}{122623}Alan, put out the fires.|Nerds, side windows.
{122806}{122845}Marion, Timmy...
{122859}{122939}...the closet. Come on, come on. Hurry!
{123010}{123071}Just get in. Get down.
{123119}{123158}I have that coat.
{123165}{123185}Yes.
{123229}{123259}Frag 'em all!
{123350}{123380}I'll call the police!
{123382}{123446}Phil, Christy, push this back. Careful.
{123507}{123527}Fire!
{123608}{123632}Service.
{123677}{123718}Great balls of fire!
{123759}{123823}The phone's dead. Nice forehand, honey.
{123863}{123885}Incoming!
{123900}{123926}I'm hit!
{123966}{124002}More shells!
{124012}{124042}Take the house!
{124056}{124122}We have to stop them|before my wife gets tennis elbow.
{124129}{124213}An electromagnetic pulse would work.|That would fry the chips.
{124308}{124367}All we need now is a nuclear warhead.
{124377}{124430}I doubt I'll have one in the junk drawer.
{124443}{124476}Nuclear warhead?
{124478}{124581}The chips aren't shielded against an EMP.|A nuclear blast would wipe them out.
{124586}{124637}That's why the military never used them.
{124640}{124712}What kind of moron would put|military technology in toys?
{124714}{124757}That would be Gizmo over here.
{124858}{124954}Actually, any electrical device generates|a magnetic field, just not a big one.
{124965}{125008}We'll need a big one.
{125073}{125111}Fire in the hole!
{125330}{125381}Alan, the window.
{125417}{125517}"I don't know but I've been told|Gorgonite blood runs mighty cold. "
{125531}{125570}No, Alan.
{125658}{125701}Way to stay heads up.
{125759}{125824}Continue artillery barrage!
{125826}{125865}Take cover! Stay low!
{125883}{125957}There's a power pole back there|with two huge transformers.
{125960}{126031}Could we use those to create|the electromagnetic whatever?
{126035}{126082}We could get them to explode.
{126089}{126132}That would fry their chips, for sure.
{126172}{126219}You could connect the transformers.
{126221}{126303}We just need to put something metal|between them.
{126306}{126403}You get a nice power boost.|Right up until they overload and blow up.
{126417}{126445}It only happened once!
{126573}{126599}That's it.
{126769}{126803}This should work.
{126946}{127007}Forget it. You're not going out there.
{127010}{127061}- There's no time!|- It's too dangerous.
{127064}{127099}We've only got one chance!
{127103}{127146}You are my responsibility and-
{127159}{127227}Dad, there's no other way!
{127447}{127494}You have to trust me.
{127506}{127528}Wait.
{127576}{127611}It's dark in here.
{127614}{127650}It's night, genius.
{127652}{127767}I mean, power has to be going through|the transformers for them to overload.
{127834}{127916}The power's on at my house|and we've tons of crap to turn on.
{127918}{128029}We have to wedge the breakers|open in your fuse box. Come on, Larry.
{128034}{128073}I hate you, Irwin.
{128174}{128233}We have met the enemy and he is you!
{128401}{128469}I love the smell of polyurethane|in the morning.
{128577}{128636}Oh, my God. Phil, in here, in here.
{128674}{128706}It's locked.
{128813}{128841}Up, up, up.
{128888}{128922}Balcony's closed.
{128933}{128963}Down, down, down.
{128967}{129016}Descend and destroy.
{129120}{129206}Let me in. Damn it! Fimple, you freak!|Let me in!
{129247}{129331}All quiet on the Western front yard!
{129363}{129443}Go and turn on every piece|of electronic equipment in your house.
{129445}{129509}This one's for Nick Nitro!
{129624}{129669}Mess around with my kid, huh?
{129672}{129731}A broomstick. I'm scared.
{129734}{129762}Get him!
{129773}{129797}First blood!
{129826}{129879}Stick this in your pipe and smoke it!
{130028}{130060}All right, Dad!
{130102}{130138}We roasted them!
{130154}{130213}There they are. Nail 'em!
{130254}{130282}Not good.
{130294}{130366}Hey, kid! Don't you like 9-inch nails?
{130438}{130481}I got hit. I'm okay.
{130550}{130622}Gorgonites, we must help Alan.
{130638}{130710}But if we fight, we will lose.
{130719}{130783}Last time we fought,|I woke up with AMIFM.
{130785}{130832}War is nuts.|I know what I'm talking about.
{130835}{130894}We shouldn't fight. We should hide.
{130909}{130977}If we hide, we will still lose.
{130989}{131040}No more hiding.
{131069}{131107}Nail them to the wall!
{131215}{131249}Gorgonites, fight!
{131398}{131474}Sanctuary! Sanctuary!
{131665}{131687}Strike!
{131689}{131732}Retreat!
{131803}{131858}Meet my wife, the old ball and chain.
{131860}{131905}I love working in the round.
{131909}{131987}I'm knocking 'em dead.|You don't like stand-up? Then sit down!
{131990}{132053}Thank you and good night,|ladies and germs.
{132152}{132222}How do you work this? Wrong way.|That's better.
{132224}{132252}Alan?
{132369}{132407}You should go now.
{132417}{132464}Archer, listen.
{132474}{132564}When that thing explodes,|you'll be fried, too.
{132610}{132642}Go.
{132745}{132800}Take that!
{132866}{132899}Watch your back.
{132901}{132937}Thanks, Dad.
{133042}{133093}I'm watching your back, Alan.
{133415}{133458}What are you packing, Tiny?
{133462}{133513}Packing? I'm packing you!
{133677}{133746}It's not a prank call. It's not.
{133748}{133787}No, wait. It is!
{133798}{133900}So you'll send some cops|to come and arrest me? Don't hang up!
{133976}{134019}Do you know what you're doing?
{134037}{134073}Yeah.
{134738}{134760}Die!
{134887}{134936}Ain't war hell?
{135143}{135194}Thanks for the lift, Punch-it.
{135359}{135410}Mayday! Mayday! I'm hit!
{135471}{135530}I'm going down! Ejecting!
{135891}{135950}Expect no mercy.
{136541}{136579}Having fun yet?
{136741}{136823}Let's have a round and a round|of applause for Archer...
{136825}{136897}...emissary of the Gorgonites. You're up!
{137043}{137086}Major Chip Hazard.
{137103}{137158}Gorgonite scum!
{137163}{137235}Leave Alan alone. Your fight is with me.
{137239}{137286}You've got a lot of guts.
{137295}{137350}Let's see what they look like.
{137403}{137477}They're wires and metal,|the same as yours.
{137535}{137635}We're nothing alike.|You are programmed to lose.
{137704}{137753}I'm also programmed to learn.
{137791}{137863}Too bad you never learned to win.
{137939}{137986}School's out, loser.
{138170}{138209}Victory is ours!
{138212}{138257}Have I got a shock for you.
{138287}{138330}You stupid toy!
{138906}{138953}Run for it! Watch out!
{139310}{139342}Get on!
{139376}{139448}Is this going to be a pattern|for our relationship?
{139460}{139492}Relationship?
{139538}{139597}- This isn't dangerous, is it?|- Well-
{139890}{139926}It's dead!
{140102}{140132}Are you all right?
{140410}{140438}Medic!
{140475}{140530}There will be no mercy.
{140854}{140930}Situation is stabilizing.|Local law enforcement is under control.
{140932}{141010}It's just a matter of compensating|those involved.
{141254}{141318}The area is secure. Bring him in.
{141422}{141469}Who is that?
{141514}{141582}Oh, no. It's him.
{142133}{142169}How you doing, Joe?
{142182}{142235}- Would you do me a big favor?|- Anything, sir.
{142238}{142353}Move your truck with the giant GloboTech|logo before the news crews get here.
{142382}{142454}I don't know, Mr. Mars,|I may have trouble handling the gears.
{142460}{142556}What with the critical head injury|and emotional distress I've suffered lately.
{142606}{142651}- Thank you.|- Right away, sir!
{142656}{142713}Excuse me. You're not off the hook yet.
{142716}{142796}There's the matter of the massive damage|to my home, my garage...
{142799}{142862}...my audio-visual system-
{142868}{142911}- This is good.|- Bye-bye.
{142932}{143032}Excuse me, Mr. Whoever-You-Are.|What about our house?
{143087}{143138}What about the pain and the anguish-
{143142}{143189}- Humiliation.|- The humiliation.
{143194}{143262}I don't think even you|have enough money to pay for that.
{143272}{143327}Okay, maybe you do.
{143348}{143399}Hey, Alan. Keep your nose clean, kid.
{143402}{143461}I'll try. Listen...
{143490}{143541}...I just wanted to say I'm sorry.
{143584}{143616}Forget it.
{143663}{143702}Toys is hell.
{143722}{143837}Mr. Mars, I just wanted|to assure you that...
{143861}{143920}...I take full responsibility for this.
{143923}{143976}Yeah, right. Give me that.
{143993}{144040}What were we charging for these?
{144043}{144084}$79.95.
{144097}{144152}Add a few zeros|to the end of that number...
{144159}{144204}...and contact our military division.
{144219}{144311}I know some South American rebels|who will find these toys very entertaining.
{144345}{144396}Dad, you know my birthday?
{144429}{144484}I just want clothes.
{144496}{144528}Come on, Christy.
{144657}{144698}Any sign of the Gorgonites?
{144701}{144748}No, none of them.
{144779}{144815}Come on, Christy.
{144821}{144853}I better go.
{145093}{145177}Too bad. This would have made|a hell of a commercial.
{145969}{146001}Archer?
{146352}{146444}Archer, are you all right?|Halt! Who goes there?
{146472}{146552}Greetings. I am Archer,|emissary of the Gorgonites.
{146555}{146633}Greetings. I am Archer,|emissary of the Gorgonites.
{146663}{146728}Your chip got fried,|just like the Commandos'.
{146780}{146823}The Commandos are dead?
{146908}{146978}Gorgonites, we won.
{146984}{147023}We did?
{147028}{147092}Well, that's a pleasant surprise.
{147118}{147200}The satellite dish must have shielded|you guys. Pretty smart.
{147204}{147240}Smart? We were lucky.
{147242}{147285}I'm glad you made it, Archer.
{147288}{147352}I'm glad you made it, Alan.
{147412}{147461}Gorgonites, we are free!
{147470}{147525}Thank you, Alan, destroyer of Commandos.
{147528}{147556}We're free.
{147560}{147601}Free? What about the cover charge?
{147646}{147701}Let me get in first. I'm big.
{147705}{147791}I'll sit in the crow's nest.|Hey, there's a dead crow up here.
{147808}{147844}I'm kidding.
{147928}{147973}Are you sure you want to do this?
{147975}{148030}Yes, Alan. It is time.
{148048}{148112}Archer, I understand why, but...
{148128}{148216}...you may not find Gorgon.|It may not even-
{148232}{148343}Even if you can't see something,|it doesn't mean it isn't there.
{148536}{148585}Look, we're out to launch!
{148623}{148674}I'm seasick already.
{148688}{148716}Bye-bye, Alan.
{148718}{148800}Bye-bye, Alan. Nice knowing you.
{149532}{149618}Anybody from out of town here?|Where are you from, sir?
{149621}{149645}Gorgon.
{149647}{149750}What exit? Hello? Is this thing on?|Is this a boat or an oil painting?
{149764}{149836}I hope we don't hit an iceberg.
{157440}{157505}Nuclear warhead?|What are you talking about?
{157531}{157567}Was that too much?
{157683}{157738}I"ve never heard you say that before.
