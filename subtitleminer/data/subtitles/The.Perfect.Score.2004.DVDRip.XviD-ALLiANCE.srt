00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:12,513


2
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,142
<i>SAT.</i>

3
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:00,894
<i>Suck Ass Test.</i>

4
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,646
<i>That's what that stands for.</i>

5
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:05,649
This is the SAT I examination.

6
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:08,902
For the first section,
you have 30 minutes.

7
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:13,532
<i>Last year, 2 million kids
took the Suck Ass Test</i>

8
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:15,659
<i>in order to get into college.</i>

9
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:20,664
<i>Scores range from 500, you're going
to community college, riding a bus,</i>

10
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:25,002
<i>to 1 600, you're Ivy League,
driving a Porsche.</i>

11
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:27,421
<i>It's a standardized test.</i>

12
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:30,757
<i>Standardized, meaning
they see us all the same.</i>

13
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:32,843
<i>A kid...</i>

14
00:01:32,885 --> 00:01:34,803
<i>... is a kid...</i>

15
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,181
<i>... is a kid!</i>

16
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:40,893
<i>Take this kid, for instance.</i>

17
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:42,186
<i>Kyle.</i>

18
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:45,439
<i>He's a good guy, who knows
where he wants to go in life.</i>

19
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:49,651
<i>But for now, the SAT is standing
in the way of Kyle's dream.</i>

20
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:52,696
<i>It's telling him, "You're just..."</i>

21
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:56,325
Time.

22
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:04,875
<i>Then there's Anna,</i>

23
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:08,253
<i>the overachiever. You know the type.</i>

24
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:14,092
<i>A future Ph.D. with a nice A-S-S.</i>

25
00:02:14,927 --> 00:02:17,638
<i>Good deeds, good grades.</i>

26
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:20,390
<i>But the SAT doesn't care about that.</i>

27
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:22,309
<i>You could be the class brain,</i>

28
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:24,895
<i>a kid in the middle
or dumb as a post.</i>

29
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:27,105
<i>When you walk into this room,</i>

30
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:30,609
<i>it's not about who you are.</i>

31
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:36,073
<i>The SAT is about who you'll be.</i>

32
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:53,340
Well, I've seen worse.

33
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,717
I need a 1430.

34
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,052
I've applied to Cornell.

35
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,476
And what are your fallback schools?

36
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:07,187
I don't have any.

37
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:10,566
That's kind of risky, isn't it?

38
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:15,529
I mean, I'm looking at your file here,
and while your GPA is strong,

39
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:19,032
your PSAT score wasn't so great.

40
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:24,204
Don't you think that 1430 is...?
Is a little bit...?

41
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:27,499
When I was 7, I built
a log cabin out of Popsicle sticks.

42
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:32,462
You can go in the halls, and five out
of six kids are not gonna have a clue

43
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:34,840
what they wanna do
the rest of their lives.

44
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,219
But Mr. Dooling...I've known
since I was 7.

45
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,556
I want to be an architect.

46
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,185
As soon as I was
old enough to realize

47
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:50,147
there's one school that turns out
the greatest architects of our time,

48
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,399
I've wanted to go there.

49
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:55,402
Cornell University.

50
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:57,738
Cornell.

51
00:03:58,614 --> 00:04:00,657
You know the guy
who designed our bus barn?

52
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:04,828
He attended a community college
just down the street.

53
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:12,377
Dooling said you couldn't do it?

54
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:15,464
<i>That's Matty, Kyle's right-hand man.</i>

55
00:04:15,506 --> 00:04:19,343
<i>They say misery loves company.
Well, it really loves Matty.</i>

56
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:22,513
Dooling said the standardized
testing says I can't do it.

57
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:24,306
You're down to a 1 020?

58
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:27,100
Jesus, that's almost
as bad as me, man.

59
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:30,229
- What'd you tell your parents?
- What do you think?

60
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:34,608
We've never been so proud, son.

61
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,657
It's good. Look it.

62
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:44,451
Hundred and forty-three.
That's what I scored.

63
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:46,662
Remember, Mom?

64
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,000
Well, look at the positives.

65
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:54,920
At least one of us is going to college.

66
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:58,465
Hello, Maryland.

67
00:04:58,549 --> 00:05:01,635
<i>Matty's girlfriend, Sandy,
is a freshman at Maryland.</i>

68
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:06,890
<i>And he was now moments away
from hooking up with her in the fall.</i>

69
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:08,559
Open the letter, Matty.

70
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:10,519
Yeah, you're right.

71
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:14,106
Why should the fact that you're
screwed ruin my big day, huh?

72
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:20,988
Oh, shit!

73
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:27,244
"SAT score insufficient."

74
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:28,787
This shit ain't fair!

75
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:31,039
Sandy's gonna be crushed.

76
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:32,833
You even know
what SAT stands for?

77
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,043
Suck Ass Test?

78
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:39,214
Scholastic Aptitude Test.
Then they got rid of that altogether.

79
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:41,091
You know what it stands for now?

80
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:44,219
SAT.

81
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:46,388
What?

82
00:05:46,722 --> 00:05:49,474
SAT stands for SAT. That's it.

83
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:53,562
- That's fucked up.
- Yeah, I know.

84
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,275
Sever All Ties, SAT.

85
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:02,362
I may as well
sever all ties with Sandy.

86
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,365
There must be somebody
we can talk to.

87
00:06:05,908 --> 00:06:07,409
There's no one we can talk to?

88
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:10,954
Do you know how many kids wanna
go up and complain about their SATs?

89
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:14,500
I mean, if one goes up, they all go up.

90
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,252
What about her?

91
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:20,172
Unless your father owns the building...

92
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:30,807
- So we'll take the test again.
- Retest is in two weeks.

93
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:34,478
There's no time to get ready.
And even if there was,

94
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,396
what's gonna change?

95
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,482
I better call Sandy.

96
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:43,070
She's gonna love this.

97
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,782
<i>Yeah, Sandy's room.</i>

98
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,829
Some guy answered.

99
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:55,123
Roommate's boyfriend.

100
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:56,542
He said, "Sandy's room."

101
00:06:56,625 --> 00:07:00,170
- So?
- So her roommate's Pam.

102
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:02,798
He'd say, "Pam's room",
not "Sandy's room."

103
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:06,134
- Pam's room! Pam!
- All right. All right, Matty.

104
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:09,471
- You're wired. It's the Red Bull.
- No! No! No!

105
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:11,181
The SAT did this!

106
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,560
The SAT is pimping out my girlfriend!

107
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:18,105
Damn it!

108
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,568
We gotta do something, man.

109
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:24,987
They're messing
with the rest of our lives.

110
00:07:25,404 --> 00:07:28,407
Matty, the College Board made
millions of dollars last year.

111
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:31,451
- You think they give a shit about us?
- Just hear me out.

112
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:34,246
Because I'm not a dumb guy,
all right? I know things.

113
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:37,833
Ask me... Ask me who's got
the best pitching staff in baseball.

114
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:41,920
Or ask me... Ask me how to rebuild
a carburetor on a '71 Buick.

115
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:44,798
Ask me... Ask me what icing is,
for chrissakes.

116
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:47,009
- Make the point, Matty.
- The point is,

117
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,677
where the hell's that
on the test?

118
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:50,846
Because you learn
the rest in college.

119
00:07:51,013 --> 00:07:54,766
I show up for a job interview, there's
a science geek, there's a math nerd.

120
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,518
Who's gonna get the job?

121
00:07:56,602 --> 00:07:58,896
The guy who can throw down
at the water cooler,

122
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:00,564
who's heard
the new Ataris disk.

123
00:08:00,606 --> 00:08:04,318
The guy who yakked in your Cutlass
after the Radiohead show.

124
00:08:04,443 --> 00:08:07,446
Me! Me! That's me. I get the job.

125
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:09,114
I'm still seeing no point.

126
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:12,576
The point is that
they are not playing fair.

127
00:08:12,743 --> 00:08:14,494
Why should we?

128
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:17,915
We know where the answers are.
ETS.

129
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,418
Maybe we should borrow them.

130
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:27,341
You want to steal
the answers to the SAT?

131
00:08:27,925 --> 00:08:29,343
You have a talent, Kyle.

132
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:32,262
What you do with a pencil and paper,
I can't learn that.

133
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:34,515
They have a test
you're never gonna pass.

134
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:37,601
Kids struggle with the SAT.
That doesn't justify thievery.

135
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:39,645
No?

136
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:42,272
Did you see my dad's truck
when you drove up?

137
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:46,193
It's the one with the large crapper
on top of it.

138
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:48,946
It doesn't say
"Matthews' Septic" on it, Kyle.

139
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:52,282
It says "Matthews and Son's Septic"
on it.

140
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:56,161
Look, if I don't get into Maryland,
my life is shit.

141
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:57,788
Literally.

142
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:00,582
And it's not even my own shit.

143
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:04,670
Kyle. Dude, check this out.

144
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:07,214
Listen, listen.
Ready? Ready? Watch this.

145
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:21,812
Thank you, Princeton, New Jersey!

146
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:26,692
Think I did "Smoke on the Water."

147
00:09:28,652 --> 00:09:30,612
You hear that?

148
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:36,493
I'm worried about you, Kyle.
One day, you're gonna try to regain

149
00:09:36,535 --> 00:09:39,454
this lost youth of yours,
you're gonna go into a shit pit.

150
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:43,083
Is that what you're doing, living
at home, jamming with the dryer?

151
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:45,794
I don't live at home.
I live above the garage.

152
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:48,130
It's a whole separate dwelling!

153
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:51,800
I've got my own phone line.

154
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:53,510
Hey, honey.

155
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:57,222
You wanna help grade assignments?
We're teaching kids to bubble in.

156
00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:59,266
First-graders?

157
00:09:59,892 --> 00:10:02,644
Mom, most of these kids
can't even read yet.

158
00:10:02,978 --> 00:10:04,730
Well, I hate to say it,

159
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:08,901
but there's more money for the school
in bubbling in than reading these days.

160
00:10:10,194 --> 00:10:12,321
<i>Now he gets it.</i>

161
00:10:13,197 --> 00:10:15,657
<i>Just follow the money.</i>

162
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:18,994
<i>Standardized testing is taking over.</i>

163
00:10:18,994 --> 00:10:21,872
<i>And it starts long before high school.</i>

164
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:33,091
<i>Test scores go up,</i>

165
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:36,053
<i>the schools get more cash.</i>

166
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:40,057
<i>In some cases,
even teachers get paid.</i>

167
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:45,062
<i>It's enough to piss you off.</i>

168
00:10:45,354 --> 00:10:49,566
<i>I mean, when you get the feeling
that everything's slipping away,</i>

169
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,818
<i>that you're gonna be left behind,</i>

170
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:56,073
<i>desperate times call for
desperate measures.</i>

171
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:05,833
Hey, Matty, if you wanted
to borrow the answers...

172
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,001
... how would you do it?

173
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:10,629
The girl at ETS.

174
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:12,673
The one the guard let pass.

175
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:15,884
You recognize her?

176
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:19,680
Francesca Curtis.

177
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:22,224
The web-page girl?

178
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:26,937
<i>Francesca Curtis.</i>

179
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:30,482
<i>Talk about your forbidden fruit.</i>

180
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:48,917
Do you guys know the name of that
kid with the Percocet addiction?

181
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:53,088
No? No? No?

182
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:54,756
- I don't know.
- OK.

183
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:58,051
If you have something for my page,
you have to write it down

184
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:00,429
and slip it in my locker.
I'll get back to you.

185
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:01,638
No, we're not...

186
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:05,267
If you don't know where my locker is,
you're in over your heads.

187
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:07,394
Actually...

188
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:09,855
... we had something else in mind.

189
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:26,038
So you guys are gonna
steal the SAT answers?

190
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:29,500
You should. You should.

191
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:34,630
I mean, it's anti-girl, it's anti...a lot of
shit, but it definitely has girl issues.

192
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:36,798
It under-scores us
on the math and verbal.

193
00:12:36,882 --> 00:12:39,510
On top of that, the College Board
settled a complaint

194
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:43,430
that the PSAT had a testicle bias
for National Merit Scholarships.

195
00:12:43,514 --> 00:12:44,973
So you'll help us, then?

196
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:49,102
- No.
- Why not?

197
00:12:49,353 --> 00:12:51,980
Pacey, I don't think you
and Dawson can pull it off.

198
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:54,274
- Do you have a plan?
- We're working on it.

199
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,443
Oh, OK.

200
00:12:56,902 --> 00:12:58,820
- You're wasting my time.
- Wait.

201
00:12:58,904 --> 00:13:02,616
Don't you find it ridiculous that
from day one, they tell us to be unique,

202
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:05,744
to be individuals, then they
give us a standardized test

203
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:08,413
that makes us all one faceless herd?

204
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,961
<i>Desmond Rhodes, superstar!</i>

205
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:18,090
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.

206
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:22,886
A hundred million dollars a year,
60 million of that from girls. For what?

207
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:26,598
To pick up a few stones to throw
at a bully that doesn't fight fair?

208
00:13:26,765 --> 00:13:27,724
Look around this place.

209
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:29,977
How many of these girls
are gonna get screwed by this test?

210
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,396
What's that gonna do
to their self-esteem?

211
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:34,731
On top of everything else
they deal with.

212
00:13:35,107 --> 00:13:36,817
You're preaching to the converted.

213
00:13:37,109 --> 00:13:40,320
I know I am.
That's why we approached you.

214
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:41,738
We need your help.

215
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,912
What the hell. It sounds like fun.

216
00:13:51,123 --> 00:13:52,958
I told you.

217
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:03,594
<i>Desmond Rhodes, superstar!</i>

218
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:06,388
<i>Desmond Rhodes, all-city.</i>

219
00:14:06,388 --> 00:14:08,932
<i>But his grades are shitty.</i>

220
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:14,354
What do you think?

221
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:18,734
I look good in red. I was thinking more
of a Philadelphia 76er red, though.

222
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:21,403
Is that why you haven't
taken the SATs yet?

223
00:14:21,612 --> 00:14:24,281
- The pros?
- Maybe.

224
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:27,993
- May I speak honestly?
- Please, I wish you would.

225
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:34,625
Des, I want you
to come to St. John's.

226
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:37,211
Because the fact of the matter is,

227
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:40,005
your game is not ready.

228
00:14:40,631 --> 00:14:42,299
If you come with me,

229
00:14:42,633 --> 00:14:46,762
I'll do everything in my power
to get you to the NBA.

230
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:49,348
But if, God forbid, you don't make it,

231
00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:51,350
you're gonna have
a degree in one hand,

232
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:55,187
and you're gonna be
prepared for life after basketball.

233
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,940
Now, you see,
that's what I'm talking about.

234
00:14:59,775 --> 00:15:01,777
So where do we go from here?

235
00:15:01,777 --> 00:15:03,987
Well, that's up to you.

236
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:07,616
You know, your grade point average
is a little bit on the low end

237
00:15:07,783 --> 00:15:11,328
for us at St. John's,
but we can work with that.

238
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:17,125
What you need is, you need
900 or better on the SATs.

239
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:28,345
Hey, Matty, don't freak out, OK?

240
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:30,597
- About what?
- Just don't.

241
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:31,932
I won't. What's up?

242
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:35,853
What are you doing?

243
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:39,898
Remember the photographer
at the basketball game?

244
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:42,234
The girl on the base line?

245
00:15:54,163 --> 00:15:56,707
- You told Anna?
- You said you wouldn't freak out.

246
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:59,376
That was before I knew you
told the class brain.

247
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:01,378
Well, I'm sorry, Matty.

248
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:04,590
You ever think maybe
we're not the only ones in this boat?

249
00:16:04,715 --> 00:16:07,676
- What boat? It's Anna Ross.
- I know.

250
00:16:08,177 --> 00:16:10,637
What do you...? What...? What...?

251
00:16:10,846 --> 00:16:12,389
Well, what'd she say anyway?

252
00:16:12,431 --> 00:16:14,766
You know, I don't even know you,

253
00:16:14,892 --> 00:16:17,144
but even if I did,

254
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:21,148
what you're talking about is wrong.
It's cheating.

255
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:23,400
- It's a victimless crime.
- OK.

256
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:26,069
Hypothetical situation:

257
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:29,364
You're driving, it's late,

258
00:16:29,406 --> 00:16:31,825
you get to a red light
in the middle of nowhere.

259
00:16:31,909 --> 00:16:33,911
Do you run the light?

260
00:16:34,912 --> 00:16:36,580
You see? You don't.

261
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:38,665
You wait.

262
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:41,251
Because a victimless crime
is still a crime.

263
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:42,920
It isn't worth it.

264
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,171
Maybe it is.

265
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:46,715
Maybe I run it. It depends.

266
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:48,926
On what?

267
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:53,388
Am I trying to get
somewhere important?

268
00:16:55,933 --> 00:16:58,519
- So she's in?
- She said no.

269
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:00,854
Yeah, but she knows about it.

270
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,565
Oh, you like this girl?

271
00:17:03,941 --> 00:17:05,400
- Matty...
- No, no, no.

272
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:07,986
If you're trying to get
into her pants...

273
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:10,989
Matt, it wasn't like that.
I just got the feeling...

274
00:17:11,657 --> 00:17:14,117
Something tells me she needs this
as bad as we do.

275
00:17:14,952 --> 00:17:17,120
Oh, OK, something tells you.

276
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:20,582
Something tells you
just to walk up to Anna Ross

277
00:17:20,582 --> 00:17:24,253
and invite her to break into ETS
to steal the answers to the SAT?

278
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:27,548
Some inner voice signed off on this?

279
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:30,592
- Yeah, it did, all right, Matt?
- That is great, Kyle.

280
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:53,073
<i>Hey, that's me.</i>

281
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:20,893
Just because they keep getting
younger doesn't mean you will.

282
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,315
Oh, here she is!

283
00:18:26,607 --> 00:18:29,359
The game run late?
Anna's the yearbook photographer.

284
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:30,944
Yeah, yes. A little.

285
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:34,448
This is Tom Hackett, a friend who
might be able to help us with Brown.

286
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:36,408
Hi, Anna.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

287
00:18:36,867 --> 00:18:38,118
Hi.

288
00:18:38,452 --> 00:18:41,246
Well, come on, honey,
sit down. Let me get that.

289
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:42,748
It's just her camera gear.

290
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:47,085
- Here, sweetheart.
- So, great, great.

291
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:54,051
So, Anna, what types of things are you
interested in besides photography?

292
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:55,511
Tell him about the pledge drive
you coordinated. So wonderful.

293
00:18:55,719 --> 00:18:58,222
Tell him about the pledge drive
you coordinated. So wonderful.

294
00:18:58,263 --> 00:19:01,642
We asked students to sign
a pledge to refrain from drug use and...

295
00:19:01,767 --> 00:19:04,311
Yeah, it was very successful.

296
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,563
- That's great.
- She's also involved

297
00:19:07,189 --> 00:19:10,442
in several other
community-related projects...

298
00:19:18,242 --> 00:19:19,701
Hey, kiddo.

299
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:21,620
I think that went well.

300
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:24,164
Oh, guess we won.

301
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:26,625
Yep, they did.

302
00:19:27,376 --> 00:19:31,505
Your father and I have noticed
the effort you've put into this retest.

303
00:19:33,382 --> 00:19:34,842
What if I mess it up again?

304
00:19:35,092 --> 00:19:38,053
You won't. You're gonna do great.

305
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,348
We're really proud of you, honey.

306
00:19:54,903 --> 00:19:56,738
Hi, who's this?

307
00:19:57,406 --> 00:19:58,699
Cleo?

308
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:02,411
I think I dialed the wrong number,
but you sound familiar.

309
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:05,080
What's your Thursday
morning class?

310
00:20:05,914 --> 00:20:08,458
M.E. Lecture? Mine too.

311
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:10,669
Yeah.

312
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:13,046
Well, listen,
I won't keep you any longer,

313
00:20:13,422 --> 00:20:18,051
but before you go, my roommates
and I are having this discussion.

314
00:20:18,427 --> 00:20:20,304
Maybe you can help.

315
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:22,848
Yeah, what's the lowest SAT score
you ever heard

316
00:20:22,931 --> 00:20:25,267
of anyone who's gotten into Brown?

317
00:20:32,441 --> 00:20:34,484
Thanks.

318
00:20:44,912 --> 00:20:46,747
ETS has the entire top floor.

319
00:20:46,914 --> 00:20:48,415
Can you get us up there?

320
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:52,002
Well, probably, but then what?

321
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,380
I don't know. We're not
talking about a big heist.

322
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:57,841
It's as easy as getting in,
finding the answers,

323
00:20:57,925 --> 00:20:59,676
making a copy and getting out.

324
00:20:59,927 --> 00:21:02,513
We just gotta think of
the easiest way to do it.

325
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:16,318
You've assembled
a crack team, chief.

326
00:21:16,401 --> 00:21:17,945
Well, what was I supposed to do?

327
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:20,656
He knows everything.
He threatened to bust us.

328
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:22,991
So does Anna Ross,
but she's not here.

329
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:24,701
You told Anna Ross?

330
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:27,246
Yeah. He had a feeling about her.

331
00:21:27,704 --> 00:21:29,540
Hey, was it anywhere
near your crotch?

332
00:21:33,502 --> 00:21:35,212
Hey, guys.

333
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:37,756
I have an idea.

334
00:21:41,218 --> 00:21:43,387
The mailroom services
the entire building.

335
00:21:43,846 --> 00:21:46,390
They hire a lot of guys
straight out of high school.

336
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,268
They won't know you.
Just act like you own the place.

337
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:51,603
Yeah, easy for you to say. You do.

338
00:21:51,645 --> 00:21:53,897
You want to know what
we're up against or not?

339
00:21:54,648 --> 00:21:56,525
You'll be fine.

340
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,195
- Cornell still worth it?
- Yeah.

341
00:22:00,362 --> 00:22:02,573
- Sandy?
- Yeah.

342
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:04,658
- Good.
- Good.

343
00:22:04,867 --> 00:22:06,285
Because we're in it now.

344
00:22:24,428 --> 00:22:26,346
Can I help you?

345
00:22:27,639 --> 00:22:30,100
These are the new mailroom slaves.

346
00:22:30,142 --> 00:22:32,853
You guys forgot your badges.

347
00:22:33,145 --> 00:22:34,354
Losers!

348
00:22:34,646 --> 00:22:36,565
Let's go. Pay attention.

349
00:22:42,821 --> 00:22:44,656
Roy, what the hell
are you doing here?

350
00:22:44,823 --> 00:22:46,241
Other than bailing you out?

351
00:22:46,325 --> 00:22:48,118
How did you get in here?

352
00:22:48,327 --> 00:22:50,370
I'm the ghost, man.

353
00:22:50,829 --> 00:22:54,333
By the way, just so you know,
mail pickup

354
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:56,001
was this morning.

355
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:22,778
Waiting till the last minute, huh?

356
00:23:22,945 --> 00:23:24,279
Hey.

357
00:23:24,655 --> 00:23:26,949
- Hi.
- Take a look at that.

358
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,246
Nice. Thanks, eh.

359
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:38,168
You think you can help me with that?

360
00:23:38,168 --> 00:23:40,003
Photography?

361
00:23:40,963 --> 00:23:42,172
No, that.

362
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:49,388
- No. I can't.
- Come on, Anna. For me?

363
00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:52,975
You ever heard of the term
"stereotype vulnerability"?

364
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:55,936
It means that some students
do badly on the SAT

365
00:23:55,936 --> 00:23:58,105
only because they know
they're expected to.

366
00:23:58,438 --> 00:24:00,732
I'll tell you about
stereotype vulnerability.

367
00:24:00,941 --> 00:24:04,570
You mess up on the SAT, you gotta
live with it. Your parents, maybe.

368
00:24:04,945 --> 00:24:07,406
But if I do, I gotta read about it
in "USA Today".

369
00:24:07,447 --> 00:24:10,200
"Desmond Rhodes Is a Dumb-ass."

370
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,871
You know, just because I play ball,

371
00:24:14,163 --> 00:24:16,707
teachers have been letting me
slide through forever.

372
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:20,419
I'm not trying to say
it's their fault, because it's not.

373
00:24:21,086 --> 00:24:23,130
I did what I did.

374
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:26,216
If there's some way I could
just get around this one thing...

375
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,387
It all means more to me now.

376
00:24:30,762 --> 00:24:32,723
That's all I'm trying to say.

377
00:24:40,939 --> 00:24:42,774
Excuse me.

378
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,568
Who are you?

379
00:24:45,986 --> 00:24:48,947
Who am l? Who are you?

380
00:24:48,989 --> 00:24:50,699
This is my office.

381
00:24:51,992 --> 00:24:53,452
Yeah.

382
00:24:53,494 --> 00:24:55,746
I'm from the mailroom.

383
00:24:55,996 --> 00:24:58,957
Well, do you have something for me?

384
00:25:00,459 --> 00:25:01,877
Yeah.

385
00:25:02,878 --> 00:25:05,005
Well, could you give it to me?

386
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:07,508
Yes, I can.

387
00:25:11,136 --> 00:25:13,180
My bad.

388
00:25:13,722 --> 00:25:15,724
Let me get that for you.

389
00:25:20,395 --> 00:25:22,397
Anything else I can do for you

390
00:25:22,731 --> 00:25:25,400
while I'm down here?

391
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:37,871
Hey, hey. You.

392
00:25:37,871 --> 00:25:39,331
Yeah, copy room, right?

393
00:25:41,375 --> 00:25:43,961
- Right, right.
- Great.

394
00:25:44,044 --> 00:25:45,754
I need two copies of this on rush.

395
00:25:45,963 --> 00:25:47,881
One comes to me,
one goes to Ann Clark,

396
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:50,342
and the master goes to 51 0, got it?

397
00:25:51,635 --> 00:25:52,928
Sure.

398
00:25:53,428 --> 00:25:55,097
Great.

399
00:26:01,645 --> 00:26:03,564
Hey!

400
00:26:04,565 --> 00:26:06,859
- What are you doing?
- I'm casing the joint.

401
00:26:10,612 --> 00:26:12,281
Oh, thank you! Here.

402
00:26:12,614 --> 00:26:14,491
We take it,
they might get suspicious.

403
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,743
They can change it by next Saturday.

404
00:26:22,332 --> 00:26:24,293
- Copy it.
- Copy it.

405
00:26:27,004 --> 00:26:29,214
Say hello to your future, Matty.

406
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:47,983
Septic And Toilets, SAT.

407
00:26:48,233 --> 00:26:50,152
Come on, man, it was a good run.

408
00:26:50,736 --> 00:26:51,528
What run? There was no run.

409
00:26:51,528 --> 00:26:53,322
What run? There was no run.

410
00:26:53,614 --> 00:26:56,492
Yeah, well, whatever it was, it's over.

411
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:02,581
<i>Francesca was right.
We were screwed.</i>

412
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:07,461
Well, at least she
didn't bring the cops.

413
00:27:08,795 --> 00:27:10,923
<i>Or maybe not.</i>

414
00:27:15,802 --> 00:27:18,138
If I wanted to do
what we talked about...

415
00:27:19,806 --> 00:27:21,850
... will you need to know why?

416
00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:25,979
No, but I don't think that's
gonna be possible now.

417
00:27:29,316 --> 00:27:31,443
Hey, can I ask you something?

418
00:27:31,818 --> 00:27:33,820
Why'd you bail on your exam?

419
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,072
I didn't.

420
00:27:36,198 --> 00:27:39,326
I saw your answer sheet.
It was practically blank.

421
00:27:43,705 --> 00:27:46,750
I was doing fine at first.

422
00:27:47,209 --> 00:27:48,794
Then I came to a story question.

423
00:27:50,712 --> 00:27:53,757
<i>A woman boards a train
in New York at midnight.</i>

424
00:27:54,925 --> 00:27:57,010
Three hours later, a man also boards.

425
00:27:58,428 --> 00:28:00,931
<i>For some reason,
I couldn't get past it.</i>

426
00:28:00,931 --> 00:28:02,391
<i>Where was this woman going?</i>

427
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:04,935
<i>- Why was she alone?
- Time.</i>

428
00:28:05,435 --> 00:28:09,690
I know it probably sounds crazy,
but it just hit home for me, and I...

429
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:12,818
I wanted to be
on that train and just be...

430
00:28:12,943 --> 00:28:15,821
... gone, somewhere.

431
00:28:17,948 --> 00:28:20,617
I guess I just froze.

432
00:28:21,952 --> 00:28:23,412
When I got home,

433
00:28:23,954 --> 00:28:26,540
I realized how disappointed
my parents would be.

434
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:32,421
I need to do great on this test.

435
00:28:32,963 --> 00:28:35,340
Yeah. Well, like I said, it's...

436
00:28:35,465 --> 00:28:37,676
If it's money you want,
we can pay you.

437
00:28:37,968 --> 00:28:39,887
No, it's not money, it's...

438
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:41,221
"We"?

439
00:28:42,973 --> 00:28:45,267
Yeah, there's someone else
besides me.

440
00:28:46,476 --> 00:28:47,853
Please.

441
00:28:47,978 --> 00:28:49,813
Don't say no.

442
00:28:54,443 --> 00:28:56,028
Yes! Yes!

443
00:28:56,028 --> 00:28:57,237
- No!
- Come on, Matt.

444
00:28:57,529 --> 00:28:59,990
- What is wrong with you?
- It's one more person.

445
00:29:00,532 --> 00:29:02,493
It's Desmond Rhodes.

446
00:29:02,743 --> 00:29:04,244
Besides, I heard he was going pro.

447
00:29:04,244 --> 00:29:06,497
No, man. He's not strong
enough to be a four,

448
00:29:06,747 --> 00:29:08,457
not quick enough to be a three.

449
00:29:08,749 --> 00:29:12,669
Besides, he's got no left hand,
and his midrange game, it needs work.

450
00:29:12,961 --> 00:29:14,713
I don't see it.

451
00:29:16,548 --> 00:29:18,675
I mean, Anna Ross,
that's bad enough.

452
00:29:19,051 --> 00:29:21,595
But do you know how high-profile
Desmond Rhodes is?

453
00:29:21,595 --> 00:29:23,305
He knows about it,
and he wants in.

454
00:29:23,764 --> 00:29:25,766
Anna says he needs it
and we can trust him.

455
00:29:25,766 --> 00:29:27,226
Anna says he needs it.

456
00:29:27,267 --> 00:29:30,145
What are we,
a fricking soup kitchen?

457
00:29:32,272 --> 00:29:34,024
Which brings me to point number two.

458
00:29:34,274 --> 00:29:36,818
Last I heard,
we had no way of doing this.

459
00:29:38,779 --> 00:29:40,531
I've been thinking about that.

460
00:29:49,206 --> 00:29:50,624
- Hey.
- Hey.

461
00:29:50,624 --> 00:29:52,000
Was your father suspicious?

462
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:54,837
Oh, no, to be suspicious,
he'd have to be interested.

463
00:29:57,923 --> 00:29:59,925
There are security codes too.

464
00:29:59,925 --> 00:30:02,219
They've got to supply
the building owner

465
00:30:02,636 --> 00:30:04,596
with a copy, in case of an emergency.

466
00:30:04,847 --> 00:30:06,431
- Yeah, I can get them.
- OK.

467
00:30:07,641 --> 00:30:09,434
OK.

468
00:30:09,643 --> 00:30:11,979
- OK.
- I will see you Tuesday.

469
00:30:12,688 --> 00:30:14,940
OK, I'll see you Tuesday.

470
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,110
- Francesca.
- Yeah?

471
00:30:18,402 --> 00:30:19,987
That bad, huh?

472
00:30:20,404 --> 00:30:21,780
My father?

473
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:24,408
No, whatever. I mean, you know,

474
00:30:24,533 --> 00:30:26,535
poor-little-rich-girl thing is played out.

475
00:30:26,535 --> 00:30:29,037
It's like the oldest story
in the world, isn't it?

476
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:32,291
Not if it's your story.

477
00:30:38,005 --> 00:30:39,715
All right, I'll see you on Tuesday.

478
00:30:39,715 --> 00:30:42,259
- I will see you Tuesday.
- Bye.

479
00:30:44,595 --> 00:30:48,223
<i>And sometimes, it's that easy.</i>

480
00:30:52,603 --> 00:30:53,979
<i>Shit happens.</i>

481
00:30:54,104 --> 00:30:56,607
<i>People join the cause.</i>

482
00:31:02,112 --> 00:31:04,364
<i>And you find yourself moving
towards something</i>

483
00:31:04,615 --> 00:31:07,075
<i>you didn't plan on approaching.</i>

484
00:31:07,117 --> 00:31:09,203
<i>Only, by the time you're aware of it,</i>

485
00:31:09,411 --> 00:31:12,539
<i>the plans of one
become the plans of six.</i>

486
00:31:16,418 --> 00:31:20,339
<i>And the plans of six become one.</i>

487
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,013
We're eating.

488
00:31:30,057 --> 00:31:33,268
- Yeah.
- Bro, what's up?

489
00:31:34,228 --> 00:31:36,688
<i>- Who is this?
- It's Roy,</i>

490
00:31:36,688 --> 00:31:38,899
from the SAT thing.

491
00:31:39,191 --> 00:31:42,361
<i>- How did you get this number?
- I'm the ghost, man.</i>

492
00:31:42,569 --> 00:31:43,946
Give it to me.

493
00:31:47,449 --> 00:31:49,451
<i>- Who's calling, please?
- What?</i>

494
00:31:53,372 --> 00:31:55,791
It's... Roy.

495
00:31:55,874 --> 00:31:57,084
<i>Well, Roy,</i>

496
00:31:57,376 --> 00:32:00,754
this is our dinnertime. We don't
interrupt your dinnertime, do we?

497
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,759
<i>- I don't have dinnertime.
- Well, that's a shame.</i>

498
00:32:06,009 --> 00:32:08,262
Now, do you have some
business with my son?

499
00:32:09,054 --> 00:32:10,973
<i>Well, I am,</i>

500
00:32:11,139 --> 00:32:14,351
at this time, assisting him

501
00:32:14,726 --> 00:32:18,438
in his SAT exam preparation.

502
00:32:20,315 --> 00:32:22,276
And I was wondering

503
00:32:22,401 --> 00:32:28,448
if he could possibly
pick me up this evening,

504
00:32:28,907 --> 00:32:34,663
as I am currently
without transportation.

505
00:32:34,746 --> 00:32:36,498
Oh, SAT.

506
00:32:36,832 --> 00:32:38,625
Well, there's hope for you yet, Roy.

507
00:32:39,293 --> 00:32:41,044
<i>Why don't you give me that address.</i>

508
00:32:41,295 --> 00:32:43,755
I appreciate that, ma'am.

509
00:32:44,298 --> 00:32:45,883
And...

510
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:51,930
... may I say that you have
an attractive voice?

511
00:32:52,806 --> 00:32:54,016
<i>It's...</i>

512
00:32:54,099 --> 00:32:56,059
... very pleasant.

513
00:32:56,852 --> 00:32:58,729
<i>Young-sounding.</i>

514
00:32:59,354 --> 00:33:03,150
- The address, please.
- 4207 Triumph Street.

515
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:05,611
<i>- With a T.
- Triumph.</i>

516
00:33:06,028 --> 00:33:08,030
<i>- All right. He'll be there.
- Thanks.</i>

517
00:33:08,238 --> 00:33:10,199
<i>Thank you, Roy.</i>

518
00:33:10,324 --> 00:33:12,117
Oh, God.

519
00:33:12,951 --> 00:33:14,953
Be on time.

520
00:33:24,046 --> 00:33:26,340
Francesca, Tiffany.

521
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,300
- Tiffany, my daughter, Francesca.
- Hi.

522
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,013
- Peace.
- Peace.

523
00:33:34,598 --> 00:33:36,016
Oh, no.

524
00:33:36,725 --> 00:33:39,645
P-l-E-C-E. You.

525
00:33:41,104 --> 00:33:43,857
No. She was just kidding.

526
00:33:47,945 --> 00:33:49,446
Dog, cool.

527
00:33:50,447 --> 00:33:52,157
Socks.

528
00:33:58,956 --> 00:34:00,791
Sweet.

529
00:34:01,959 --> 00:34:04,044
What school gave you this?

530
00:34:06,463 --> 00:34:08,215
It's my uncle's ride, man.

531
00:34:08,465 --> 00:34:10,384
What school gave it to your uncle?

532
00:34:12,052 --> 00:34:14,012
Why do you call yourself "the ghost"?

533
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:18,183
At school, man,
I hear things and I see things,

534
00:34:18,183 --> 00:34:20,185
but nobody hears or sees me.

535
00:34:21,228 --> 00:34:22,479
You think?

536
00:34:22,729 --> 00:34:25,065
- I got your cell number, didn't l?
- So?

537
00:34:27,234 --> 00:34:28,902
You got mine?

538
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:34,783
This fool is crazy.

539
00:34:37,744 --> 00:34:39,913
Don't touch my shit.

540
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,501
Eight o'clock.

541
00:34:44,751 --> 00:34:46,753
You're positive your
brother's not there?

542
00:34:47,254 --> 00:34:49,548
We got the place to ourselves.
He promised.

543
00:34:49,756 --> 00:34:51,425
- You're sure?
- Yeah.

544
00:34:54,553 --> 00:34:56,471
Oh, shit!

545
00:34:57,556 --> 00:34:59,808
Oh, that's my brother. Hey.

546
00:35:03,437 --> 00:35:05,898
What's going on? Salute. Salute.

547
00:35:05,939 --> 00:35:07,691
Sorry, bro. Hope it comes out.

548
00:35:07,941 --> 00:35:09,735
- What's up?
- What the hell is this?

549
00:35:09,943 --> 00:35:11,904
You said we could have
the place tonight.

550
00:35:11,945 --> 00:35:15,949
Was that supposed to be tonight?
Because tonight is wine tasting...

551
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:18,577
Wine Tasting Tuesday.

552
00:35:18,952 --> 00:35:21,079
What's up?

553
00:35:22,956 --> 00:35:24,833
Oh, yeah.

554
00:35:25,459 --> 00:35:30,047
- Wow, what's this?
- Wine Tasting Tuesday.

555
00:35:30,047 --> 00:35:31,965
Nice.

556
00:35:32,549 --> 00:35:34,551
Look, Larry, Larry...

557
00:35:34,551 --> 00:35:36,303
You promised.

558
00:35:37,054 --> 00:35:42,017
Yeah, I know. But maybe we
can do it next Tuesday.

559
00:35:44,102 --> 00:35:46,396
All right, this is ETS.

560
00:35:47,731 --> 00:35:50,943
This is so cute,
this whole thing going...

561
00:35:52,236 --> 00:35:54,613
I'm sorry. It was a misunderstanding.

562
00:35:54,738 --> 00:35:56,782
Man, what the hell is she typing?

563
00:35:56,990 --> 00:36:00,077
- I'm just taking notes.
- All right, this is ETS.

564
00:36:00,828 --> 00:36:03,580
- Who took that photo?
- Anna took it.

565
00:36:07,209 --> 00:36:10,629
I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this.

566
00:36:10,754 --> 00:36:13,423
You look comfortable in
your Old Navy cotton pullover.

567
00:36:13,757 --> 00:36:15,717
You gotta get this look.

568
00:36:16,218 --> 00:36:17,636
- Did I do something?
- Yeah.

569
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:21,390
- You did, you got a 4.0 GPA.
- Francesca, just stop it, all right?

570
00:36:23,141 --> 00:36:25,644
Do you know what the fatal flaw
is for most heists?

571
00:36:26,812 --> 00:36:28,313
It's trusting the team.

572
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,984
So excuse me for being a bitch,
but why is the valedictorian here?

573
00:36:31,984 --> 00:36:34,319
I'm not the valedictorian. I'm second.

574
00:36:34,695 --> 00:36:36,280
That explains everything.

575
00:36:36,613 --> 00:36:39,032
Everyone has reasons.
We don't need to know them.

576
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:40,534
Really? I think we do.

577
00:36:40,742 --> 00:36:44,496
It's like "The Breakfast Club", where
they get stoned and make confessions.

578
00:36:44,705 --> 00:36:47,416
- Oh, sweet.
- Maybe we should.

579
00:36:47,666 --> 00:36:49,585
Maybe we should say
why we're here.

580
00:36:50,252 --> 00:36:52,963
- Kyle said we wouldn't have to, so...
- I think we do.

581
00:36:53,088 --> 00:36:55,257
So I'll start.

582
00:36:55,674 --> 00:36:58,635
I'm here to make new friends.
And for the wine, of course.

583
00:37:00,012 --> 00:37:01,263
How about you, superstar?

584
00:37:01,722 --> 00:37:03,473
I'm here because the SAT is racist.

585
00:37:05,058 --> 00:37:07,394
Well, that didn't take long,
now, did it?

586
00:37:07,561 --> 00:37:09,980
You don't think so?
Who created the test?

587
00:37:10,063 --> 00:37:12,524
Rich white guys.
Who has the highest scores?

588
00:37:12,566 --> 00:37:15,360
Asian chicks. Middle-class Asian girls

589
00:37:15,736 --> 00:37:18,113
who watch less than an hour
of television a day.

590
00:37:18,238 --> 00:37:22,201
They can't drive, but they can
take the shit out of the SAT.

591
00:37:22,743 --> 00:37:25,621
- Whatever. Why you here?
- Because I'm not smart enough

592
00:37:25,621 --> 00:37:28,457
to get the score I need,
as opposed to being a genius

593
00:37:28,624 --> 00:37:30,542
- who's screwed by the Man.
- Matty...

594
00:37:31,126 --> 00:37:32,920
It is. It's unfair to certain groups.

595
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,505
Like kiss-ass valedictorians.

596
00:37:34,671 --> 00:37:37,257
- I'm not the valedictorian.
- Right, you're second.

597
00:37:37,382 --> 00:37:39,927
All right! Enough, OK?

598
00:37:40,844 --> 00:37:44,181
This is the floor plan
for the regional ETS office tower.

599
00:37:44,181 --> 00:37:46,975
Here's the hardware schedule
with security-camera specs

600
00:37:47,309 --> 00:37:50,145
that are here, here, here and here.

601
00:37:50,354 --> 00:37:53,190
- It's fruity, and yet, woody.
- Roy!

602
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,776
Pay attention. Please.

603
00:37:56,610 --> 00:38:00,322
Francesca has the lock codes, and we
know where the test answers are filed.

604
00:38:00,489 --> 00:38:03,575
- Shit.
- If you guys think we can somehow...

605
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:07,329
- Yeah.
- Yo! This thing hemp?

606
00:38:07,371 --> 00:38:10,082
- This is never gonna work.
- lt'll be OK.

607
00:38:10,374 --> 00:38:11,834
Yeah, we're gonna be great.

608
00:38:12,251 --> 00:38:15,838
I mean, all-state's phone is
ringing off the hook here, and

609
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:17,881
Roy's trying to smoke
Larry's comforter.

610
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:22,386
Hey, Roy! Roy! I'm serious,
you're about out of here!

611
00:38:22,636 --> 00:38:25,013
Shit. Shit.

612
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:26,640
Need some help with that?

613
00:38:27,558 --> 00:38:30,727
No, not unless you can code
Visual Basic.

614
00:38:33,063 --> 00:38:34,439
Yeah.

615
00:38:39,069 --> 00:38:41,572
- What did you do?
- I don't know.

616
00:38:42,072 --> 00:38:44,908
Some shit with the dynamic variables.

617
00:38:46,577 --> 00:38:49,413
- So are we gonna do this, or what?
- Yeah, we are.

618
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:53,000
- Can you turn off the phone?
- You got a problem with me?

619
00:38:53,083 --> 00:38:55,460
I got a problem
with anybody putting us at risk.

620
00:38:55,586 --> 00:38:59,131
So you think it's me? Fine.
I don't need this shit, no way.

621
00:38:59,131 --> 00:39:00,757
Anna, you down with this?

622
00:39:01,341 --> 00:39:04,261
You guys see Desmond
on TV this weekend?

623
00:39:05,888 --> 00:39:08,056
Playing for St. John's.

624
00:39:09,433 --> 00:39:11,935
He took 25 and 10 off North Carolina.

625
00:39:15,063 --> 00:39:16,565
Matty, you saw it, right?

626
00:39:16,565 --> 00:39:19,818
You were at your apartment
with Sandy in Maryland.

627
00:39:21,653 --> 00:39:25,365
I missed it. I had a date.

628
00:39:25,657 --> 00:39:27,826
But my roommate at Brown
is a big sports fan,

629
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,871
- and she said it was great.
- You know what? It was.

630
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:34,124
I saw the whole thing
from my Cornell dorm room.

631
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:36,627
Roy, you had money on it.

632
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,463
Well, I hope you covered the spread.

633
00:39:39,463 --> 00:39:43,175
We can do this. We can all get
where each one of us wants to go,

634
00:39:43,342 --> 00:39:45,886
but we have got to trust each other.

635
00:39:47,346 --> 00:39:49,097
You talk a good game,

636
00:39:49,348 --> 00:39:52,059
but I think your mom's
gonna come in with snacks.

637
00:39:52,351 --> 00:39:56,563
This is serious.
Some of us got a lot to lose.

638
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,900
I think that we all have a lot to lose.

639
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,486
All right, fair enough.
Just hear me out.

640
00:40:02,486 --> 00:40:05,239
Anyone who doesn't
like the plan can walk.

641
00:40:12,746 --> 00:40:14,289
OK.

642
00:40:15,749 --> 00:40:17,209
All right.

643
00:40:19,002 --> 00:40:22,172
Friday afternoon, Francesca will
enter through the lobby.

644
00:40:24,091 --> 00:40:26,552
<i>The same as any other Friday.</i>

645
00:40:27,135 --> 00:40:31,223
<i>Then she'll make appointments
for me and Matty with her dad's firm.</i>

646
00:40:33,141 --> 00:40:35,269
What if he recognizes you?

647
00:40:36,228 --> 00:40:38,772
- He won't recognize me.
- Oh, he might.

648
00:40:42,818 --> 00:40:44,361
- Hey, get down!
- Freeze!

649
00:40:46,238 --> 00:40:47,447
Hands up!

650
00:40:49,032 --> 00:40:50,492
He won't recognize me.

651
00:40:51,034 --> 00:40:53,036
Once I'm up and in,
Matty's gonna sign in

652
00:40:53,036 --> 00:40:55,289
and join us in Francesca's
father's office.

653
00:40:59,042 --> 00:41:03,255
- Where am I gonna be?
- You're waiting in the woods nearby.

654
00:41:03,505 --> 00:41:05,215
With that big-ass crow?

655
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:15,267
- Alone?
- No, with Desmond and Anna.

656
00:41:18,478 --> 00:41:21,940
- Oh, Roy.
- Yeah, baby, you feel that?

657
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:32,451
- Give it to me.
- Who's your daddy now? Come on.

658
00:41:34,453 --> 00:41:36,371
Maybe we should all go together.

659
00:41:36,955 --> 00:41:38,248
We need you on the outside

660
00:41:38,457 --> 00:41:40,959
for when the night guard
makes his rounds.

661
00:41:40,959 --> 00:41:44,463
Their rotation isn't really precise,
and we're gonna have flashlights.

662
00:41:44,963 --> 00:41:46,965
So we'll watch out for the guards
to make sure you cut them off.

663
00:41:46,965 --> 00:41:48,342
Right. Exactly, exactly.

664
00:41:48,967 --> 00:41:50,969
Now, inside, Francesca's
gonna ask the guard

665
00:41:50,969 --> 00:41:53,263
to disconnect the alarm
on the rear door,

666
00:41:53,472 --> 00:41:58,143
saying she has boxes to unload from
her car, something she's done before.

667
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:02,564
Hold it right there.

668
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:36,014
Matty and I have 20 seconds
to get inside the stairwell

669
00:42:36,265 --> 00:42:39,852
<i>before the guard returns to his
desk and his security monitors.</i>

670
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,857
<i>We'll take the stairs to the roof
and wait for Francesca's keycard.</i>

671
00:42:46,191 --> 00:42:48,819
<i>From here, we're almost home.
We get in,</i>

672
00:42:49,069 --> 00:42:51,488
<i>we get the answers, and we get out.</i>

673
00:42:53,073 --> 00:42:56,535
Shortly after midnight, this is me.

674
00:42:59,788 --> 00:43:01,748
Twenty-five minutes
into Saturday morning,

675
00:43:01,748 --> 00:43:04,710
and a whole lot closer
to the rest of my life.

676
00:43:06,336 --> 00:43:08,630
Who's gonna join me?

677
00:43:13,302 --> 00:43:14,636
All right.

678
00:43:43,582 --> 00:43:45,209
You smoke?

679
00:43:46,585 --> 00:43:48,837
It makes kissing kind of nasty.

680
00:43:49,087 --> 00:43:51,507
Then we won't be kissing, huh?

681
00:43:53,091 --> 00:43:55,802
I know. I was just...

682
00:43:57,095 --> 00:43:59,097
Why are you here?

683
00:43:59,598 --> 00:44:01,350
I need the answers.

684
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:04,186
To join Sandy at Maryland.

685
00:44:06,104 --> 00:44:10,651
What's so great about her,
I mean, aside from being smoke-free?

686
00:44:11,902 --> 00:44:13,695
You wouldn't get it.

687
00:44:14,404 --> 00:44:16,782
- Try me.
- All right.

688
00:44:17,908 --> 00:44:20,452
I mean, it's like,
I don't get the best grades.

689
00:44:20,911 --> 00:44:23,789
I'm not really great at... anything.

690
00:44:23,872 --> 00:44:27,209
But here was something
that I was finally great at.

691
00:44:27,751 --> 00:44:30,170
I was great at being with Sandy.

692
00:44:31,338 --> 00:44:34,716
I could make her laugh, I could...

693
00:44:35,342 --> 00:44:37,427
... guess what she was thinking.

694
00:44:37,845 --> 00:44:40,639
And it was just...

695
00:44:41,849 --> 00:44:44,810
... great. It was great.

696
00:44:46,353 --> 00:44:47,604
And?

697
00:44:50,357 --> 00:44:54,820
And I just can't wait to be great again.

698
00:45:02,369 --> 00:45:03,620
<i>Give us the bank's money!</i>

699
00:45:03,954 --> 00:45:06,707
<i>Your money's federally-insured,
you're not gonna lose it.</i>

700
00:45:06,957 --> 00:45:09,168
<i>Think of your families.
Don't risk your life.</i>

701
00:45:09,459 --> 00:45:10,919
<i>Don't try and be a hero.</i>

702
00:45:10,961 --> 00:45:14,214
<i>Now I want you to sit on the floor,
put your hands on your head.</i>

703
00:45:29,062 --> 00:45:32,649
<i>And so the day arrives.
We had packed it,</i>

704
00:45:32,858 --> 00:45:38,614
<i>rolled it, smoked it.
Now it was time to ride the buzz.</i>

705
00:46:04,056 --> 00:46:05,390
<i>- Yeah.
- Hey. It's me.</i>

706
00:46:05,641 --> 00:46:07,851
Set your phone to vibrate,
call me back, OK?

707
00:46:12,022 --> 00:46:13,774
From here on out, we use re-dial.

708
00:46:14,024 --> 00:46:16,193
<i>- Tell Roy the same thing, OK?
- OK.</i>

709
00:46:18,445 --> 00:46:19,738
Thank you.

710
00:46:39,299 --> 00:46:42,302
Oh, shit. I forgot the bolt cutters.

711
00:46:42,469 --> 00:46:43,929
- What?
- Just kidding.

712
00:46:44,471 --> 00:46:46,390
That's funny.

713
00:46:53,981 --> 00:46:56,024
Here we go. Masks.

714
00:47:07,578 --> 00:47:10,664
- Did you bring your Floaties?
- It's all I could find.

715
00:47:43,906 --> 00:47:47,993
All right, we're here.
Answers are here.

716
00:47:48,410 --> 00:47:52,372
Keep your masks on till we get past
the security cameras. Just in case.

717
00:47:59,004 --> 00:48:02,049
- You walk much?
- My mask is fogged.

718
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,220
There's a camera around the corner,
on the right.

719
00:48:06,803 --> 00:48:10,807
- So stay low and tight to the wall.
- What do we do if it sees us?

720
00:48:10,807 --> 00:48:14,394
About three to six months
and a lot of community service.

721
00:48:21,193 --> 00:48:23,695
Don't worry. I'm not gonna
look at your underwear.

722
00:48:23,695 --> 00:48:25,697
Who says I'm wearing any?

723
00:48:41,004 --> 00:48:42,840
Matty, you OK?

724
00:48:43,006 --> 00:48:45,801
I can't see...
I can't see through this stupid mask!

725
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:49,137
Just come forward. Come forward.

726
00:48:49,263 --> 00:48:50,931
- OK.
- No, go 2 o'clock.

727
00:48:51,139 --> 00:48:53,350
Two o'clock.

728
00:48:53,559 --> 00:48:56,645
- This way, this way.
- Where?

729
00:48:57,145 --> 00:48:59,731
Grab my hand! Grab my hand!

730
00:49:04,528 --> 00:49:06,363
- Thanks.
- This way.

731
00:49:13,036 --> 00:49:17,040
- Nature calls.
- Yeah, it's something, isn't it?

732
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:20,294
No. Nature calls.

733
00:49:35,559 --> 00:49:37,728
Can I ask you a question?

734
00:49:40,063 --> 00:49:42,733
Why do you smoke pot?

735
00:49:46,570 --> 00:49:47,863
Something to do?

736
00:49:53,076 --> 00:49:54,745
Why do you bite your fingernails?

737
00:50:14,765 --> 00:50:17,643
This is it. Francesca?

738
00:50:20,354 --> 00:50:22,105
OK, OK.

739
00:50:22,231 --> 00:50:25,442
Ladies and gentlemen,
I present you with...

740
00:50:27,444 --> 00:50:29,446
... a serious waste of time.

741
00:50:29,446 --> 00:50:32,449
Why would you lock the door to this?

742
00:50:32,950 --> 00:50:35,202
This was it.

743
00:50:35,452 --> 00:50:38,956
Matty, I swear, this was it.
The answers went to 510 for filing.

744
00:50:38,956 --> 00:50:41,375
Well, "went to" doesn't help us,
now, does it?

745
00:50:43,961 --> 00:50:48,590
I had the answers in my hands.

746
00:50:53,971 --> 00:50:55,514
"One comes back to me."

747
00:50:56,181 --> 00:50:58,684
Kyle, what? Kyle?

748
00:50:59,184 --> 00:51:00,686
Shit!

749
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:04,690
- What are you doing?
- Stop.

750
00:51:16,869 --> 00:51:18,120
Who the hell was that?

751
00:51:18,370 --> 00:51:21,290
That's Bernie. He's the lobby guard
who hits on everybody.

752
00:51:21,874 --> 00:51:24,376
- Well, he's early.
- Where were you going?

753
00:51:24,376 --> 00:51:25,878
"One comes back to me."

754
00:51:26,378 --> 00:51:29,506
The guy I copied for said
the master goes to 51 0 for filing

755
00:51:29,882 --> 00:51:31,508
and "one comes back to me".

756
00:51:31,884 --> 00:51:37,556
- What, you wanna call him at home?
- I wanna find his office. 545.

757
00:51:42,186 --> 00:51:43,520
Roy, what time do you have?

758
00:51:44,688 --> 00:51:46,648
About that time.

759
00:51:47,691 --> 00:51:50,694
Yeah. Can you see the far side
of the building from here?

760
00:51:53,697 --> 00:51:56,533
I'm gonna go see if I can get
a better view.

761
00:52:28,982 --> 00:52:30,275
Shit.

762
00:52:41,495 --> 00:52:42,955
My phone!

763
00:52:43,330 --> 00:52:44,581
My phone.

764
00:52:48,919 --> 00:52:50,170
Shit.

765
00:53:02,182 --> 00:53:05,435
Roy! Roy, the guard.

766
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:10,149
- There's a problem with my phone.
- What problem?

767
00:53:12,693 --> 00:53:14,153
Phone!

768
00:53:18,782 --> 00:53:22,035
- Yeah.
- Shut off the lights. Shut off the lights.

769
00:53:32,921 --> 00:53:35,382
<i>- Yes?
- Sorry.</i>

770
00:53:35,924 --> 00:53:37,926
<i>All clear.</i>

771
00:53:37,926 --> 00:53:39,761
Tell Roy I'm kicking his ass.

772
00:53:48,604 --> 00:53:52,483
Hey, hey, I got it. It's office 545.

773
00:53:56,236 --> 00:53:59,198
Hey. Maybe it's in here.

774
00:54:09,374 --> 00:54:10,751
You know what this means.

775
00:54:14,087 --> 00:54:15,964
Hello.

776
00:54:20,093 --> 00:54:21,845
It's for you.

777
00:54:23,096 --> 00:54:24,348
Is it a chick?

778
00:54:28,602 --> 00:54:31,146
- Hello?
- Roy, we need your help.

779
00:54:34,107 --> 00:54:35,526
Who is this?

780
00:54:36,652 --> 00:54:38,862
It's Kyle, Roy.

781
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,701
<i>- Clyde's.
- Dave, it's Matty.</i>

782
00:54:44,701 --> 00:54:48,330
- Hey, Matty. What's up, man?
- I need some flowers delivered.

783
00:54:48,789 --> 00:54:51,041
- Tell him roses.
- Make it roses,

784
00:54:51,291 --> 00:54:54,378
and you think you could hook me up
with a bottle of champagne?

785
00:54:58,048 --> 00:55:00,592
<i>- Yeah, I think I could do that.
- All right, nice.</i>

786
00:55:00,926 --> 00:55:07,099
- And I need a card signed, "From..."
- "From your secret admirer."

787
00:55:07,516 --> 00:55:11,395
"From your secret admirer."
Here's the name and address.

788
00:55:14,022 --> 00:55:18,235
If you could do anything with your life,
and money was no object,

789
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:20,028
what would you do?

790
00:55:20,028 --> 00:55:21,238
Anything at all?

791
00:55:26,535 --> 00:55:28,662
When I was a kid,

792
00:55:29,037 --> 00:55:33,375
I used to play this video game
for hours, "Street Fighter 2".

793
00:55:35,043 --> 00:55:40,132
And I remember thinking, "You know,
people get paid to do this.

794
00:55:40,549 --> 00:55:43,969
"To think up the game
and to create the characters."

795
00:55:44,553 --> 00:55:48,056
Like there's this
one character, Blanka.

796
00:55:48,056 --> 00:55:53,187
He's, like, half-human and half-lizard,
who eats his opponents.

797
00:55:56,064 --> 00:56:00,986
Well, I mean, you know, he either
zaps them with lightning or he...

798
00:56:01,069 --> 00:56:03,238
... bites their faces off.

799
00:56:03,572 --> 00:56:05,574
It's pretty cool, huh?

800
00:56:06,074 --> 00:56:08,744
So you'd design video games.

801
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:13,582
No.

802
00:56:13,582 --> 00:56:15,876
I'd kind of like to be Blanka.

803
00:56:22,090 --> 00:56:24,760
I was thinking someday
I might wanna be an actor.

804
00:56:26,094 --> 00:56:29,848
As opposed to solving world hunger
or curing a terminal disease?

805
00:56:33,101 --> 00:56:37,523
- See what I mean?
- I would run a no-kill animal shelter.

806
00:56:37,606 --> 00:56:39,274
Or...

807
00:56:40,609 --> 00:56:42,778
I'd just be a mom.

808
00:56:44,112 --> 00:56:46,365
Not just a mother.

809
00:56:46,615 --> 00:56:49,409
I would be a real mom.

810
00:56:50,118 --> 00:56:52,913
You know, one who cared more
about the title of "parent"

811
00:56:53,121 --> 00:56:54,832
than the one on her business card.

812
00:56:58,126 --> 00:56:59,545
Or porn.

813
00:57:00,629 --> 00:57:03,590
Hey, guys, he's here. Dave's here.

814
00:57:13,851 --> 00:57:15,811
She opens up the door, you haul ass.

815
00:57:15,853 --> 00:57:17,855
- What do I do?
- You wait here with me.

816
00:57:17,855 --> 00:57:19,940
They only need Roy.

817
00:57:24,987 --> 00:57:27,030
All right, Flash, you ready?

818
00:57:31,493 --> 00:57:32,995
You need to get off that bong.

819
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:40,210
<i>- OK, I'm here.
- OK, wait.</i>

820
00:57:40,627 --> 00:57:42,921
Not yet. Wait for me.

821
00:57:47,092 --> 00:57:48,302
You sure they just need Roy?

822
00:57:48,594 --> 00:57:50,387
- Maybe we should go too.
- Just Roy.

823
00:57:58,562 --> 00:57:59,855
All right, Roy. Get ready.

824
00:58:03,567 --> 00:58:05,402
- You Bernie?
- Yeah.

825
00:58:05,569 --> 00:58:07,154
Delivery.

826
00:58:14,578 --> 00:58:16,622
- Go, go, go!
- Go, go, go!

827
00:58:22,377 --> 00:58:23,712
Go!

828
00:58:27,466 --> 00:58:29,009
Oh, hell, no!

829
00:58:31,970 --> 00:58:33,180
Shit...

830
00:58:54,993 --> 00:58:56,662
- Is he in?
- What the hell was that?

831
00:58:56,662 --> 00:59:00,374
<i>- Francesca, is he in?
- Yeah, he's in. Plus two.</i>

832
00:59:01,166 --> 00:59:02,668
What?

833
00:59:04,670 --> 00:59:07,214
Oh, man, not steps!

834
00:59:12,845 --> 00:59:16,139
We think the answers are in this
computer, but there's a password.

835
00:59:16,431 --> 00:59:18,767
- Is this the guy?
- Yeah.

836
00:59:47,379 --> 00:59:50,090
You're a filthy man, Arnie.

837
00:59:52,885 --> 00:59:56,180
- What do they call this thing?
- "Verification master".

838
01:00:05,647 --> 01:00:09,193
"Mercer County SAT exam
to be administered Fall 2004".

839
01:00:09,526 --> 01:00:13,155
Print one. Print one.
Print one, let's get out of here.

840
01:00:16,450 --> 01:00:20,329
You need three other passwords
and three other people to print.

841
01:00:21,163 --> 01:00:22,748
- Can't you figure it out?
- Sure.

842
01:00:22,956 --> 01:00:25,167
Just give me six months
and a ClA mainframe.

843
01:00:25,375 --> 01:00:27,461
Well, that was fun.

844
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:30,839
- The exam's right here.
- Yeah, you just need the answers.

845
01:00:32,424 --> 01:00:34,426
Exactly.

846
01:00:35,928 --> 01:00:40,432
Oh, I get it. Come on, team.
Makes perfect sense.

847
01:00:40,432 --> 01:00:43,310
We'll take the test now so we can
steal our own answers.

848
01:00:43,936 --> 01:00:46,939
Then we'll take the real test
with the stolen answers we were

849
01:00:46,939 --> 01:00:48,941
afraid would be wrong
in the first place.

850
01:00:49,441 --> 01:00:51,026
It's nice. It's really nice.

851
01:00:52,444 --> 01:00:55,948
- So who wants pancakes?
- Wait. Guys, the exam's right here.

852
01:00:56,448 --> 01:00:58,325
Maybe it was bigger than us
one-on-one,

853
01:00:58,450 --> 01:01:00,160
but it can't beat us all together.

854
01:01:00,452 --> 01:01:03,121
- Kyle, come on, man.
- Matty, just try this, OK?

855
01:01:03,747 --> 01:01:07,251
"lf it takes 1 5 people eight hours
to make 100 items,

856
01:01:07,376 --> 01:01:09,878
"how many hours will
it take six people,

857
01:01:09,878 --> 01:01:13,257
"working at the same rate,
to make half as many items?"

858
01:01:13,423 --> 01:01:14,925
Ten.

859
01:01:16,468 --> 01:01:18,178
Ten hours.

860
01:01:18,428 --> 01:01:19,680
D. Ten.

861
01:01:21,431 --> 01:01:23,517
She's second in the class.

862
01:01:25,310 --> 01:01:26,895
All right, all right, let's see.

863
01:01:26,895 --> 01:01:30,399
"A ten-quart mixture consists of
one part juice to nine parts water..."

864
01:01:30,816 --> 01:01:34,194
Jesus, what lightweight's
making this drink?

865
01:01:38,198 --> 01:01:41,243
"lf X quarts of juice and Y quarts
of water are added to make

866
01:01:41,702 --> 01:01:46,165
"a 27-quart mixture that consists of
one part juice to two parts water,

867
01:01:46,206 --> 01:01:47,958
"what is the value of X?"

868
01:01:49,418 --> 01:01:50,711
Nine.

869
01:01:52,045 --> 01:01:53,297
C is nine.

870
01:01:53,547 --> 01:01:59,678
No. It says, if X quarts of juice
are added, what is the value of X?

871
01:02:00,053 --> 01:02:05,058
We already have one part juice.
So nine minus one equals X.

872
01:02:05,058 --> 01:02:06,768
- Eight.
- Yeah.

873
01:02:07,728 --> 01:02:10,606
- D is eight.
- He's right. Sorry.

874
01:02:10,689 --> 01:02:13,567
No. Guys, don't be sorry.
That's two down.

875
01:02:13,650 --> 01:02:16,695
We can walk away right now,
but what are we walking away to?

876
01:02:17,154 --> 01:02:19,406
I say we trust each other
and try as a group.

877
01:02:19,656 --> 01:02:22,576
- He's right. We can do this.
- Unless we run out of time.

878
01:02:22,659 --> 01:02:25,662
So we split it up. Can you
access this from another computer?

879
01:02:25,662 --> 01:02:28,415
- As long as it's in this office.
- Done. All right.

880
01:02:28,665 --> 01:02:31,585
Someone's gotta take a crack
at verbal. Francesca?

881
01:02:31,919 --> 01:02:34,796
No, no. Me and words
are not so goodly.

882
01:02:34,922 --> 01:02:39,301
OK, Anna, you and I will do verbal.
Someone's gotta do math.

883
01:02:39,927 --> 01:02:41,637
I'll do it.

884
01:02:43,931 --> 01:02:45,557
You sure? It could be a little...

885
01:02:45,974 --> 01:02:48,727
Have you ever heard of the term,
"Kiss my ass"?

886
01:02:49,561 --> 01:02:52,397
Math doesn't scare me.
You just take care of the verbal.

887
01:02:53,065 --> 01:02:55,567
OK, who's helping Des?

888
01:02:55,567 --> 01:02:57,736
Well, I guess I can.

889
01:02:58,070 --> 01:03:00,489
But only with quadratic equations,

890
01:03:00,572 --> 01:03:04,368
coordinate geometry
and algebraic visualizations.

891
01:03:06,453 --> 01:03:08,330
- Well, if you want...
- Yeah.

892
01:03:08,455 --> 01:03:10,791
- Yeah.
- Hey.

893
01:03:10,958 --> 01:03:14,962
Well, Hasselhoff, it looks like you
and me. We'll watch the lobby.

894
01:03:30,519 --> 01:03:34,231
You don't have to wait there.
Guard's not due for a couple hours.

895
01:03:42,406 --> 01:03:45,284
You know, Sandy liked
this blue color.

896
01:03:47,327 --> 01:03:49,079
True Berry Blue.

897
01:03:49,830 --> 01:03:51,748
Not anymore.

898
01:03:52,791 --> 01:03:55,669
You said, "liked".
You said, "Sandy liked".

899
01:03:56,378 --> 01:03:58,589
Likes. Whatever.

900
01:04:00,299 --> 01:04:02,676
What's wrong,
she doesn't call anymore?

901
01:04:03,302 --> 01:04:05,470
No, she calls. She calls.

902
01:04:05,554 --> 01:04:08,599
Yeah, but not like before.

903
01:04:10,058 --> 01:04:11,268
She's busy.

904
01:04:14,354 --> 01:04:16,648
Matty, it's over.

905
01:04:18,734 --> 01:04:21,111
It's never gonna be like
the way it was.

906
01:04:25,032 --> 01:04:26,450
Don't...

907
01:04:27,034 --> 01:04:29,286
Look, you don't know
anything about it, OK?

908
01:04:29,411 --> 01:04:30,913
Well, I know it's not healthy.

909
01:04:31,413 --> 01:04:33,624
Yeah, and folding yourself up
into a web page

910
01:04:33,916 --> 01:04:36,877
because Daddy doesn't
love you enough is, huh?

911
01:04:45,010 --> 01:04:47,638
I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.

912
01:04:49,014 --> 01:04:50,891
Then why'd you say it?

913
01:04:55,103 --> 01:04:57,189
Because she doesn't call anymore.

914
01:05:08,909 --> 01:05:13,038
Remember when you said that you
were great at being Sandy's boyfriend?

915
01:05:13,413 --> 01:05:15,165
Well, you weren't.

916
01:05:17,042 --> 01:05:20,462
That's nice, Francesca.
Why don't you just rub it in a little...

917
01:05:24,675 --> 01:05:28,428
You weren't great at being
some girl's boyfriend, Matty.

918
01:05:28,679 --> 01:05:32,307
You just found someone who
let you be OK with yourself.

919
01:05:45,612 --> 01:05:49,908
- "X is to Y..."
- As this shit is to boring.

920
01:05:51,201 --> 01:05:53,620
What score do you need
on the test anyway?

921
01:05:53,704 --> 01:05:57,166
- A 900.
- And you're taking the math for us?

922
01:05:57,416 --> 01:06:01,170
I was afraid of the verbal, Roy. I can
ace the math and still not get a 900.

923
01:06:01,962 --> 01:06:03,338
So why don't you go pro?

924
01:06:04,506 --> 01:06:06,383
You don't know my mom, man.

925
01:06:06,508 --> 01:06:09,428
She all about college degrees.
She worked three jobs.

926
01:06:09,636 --> 01:06:12,556
If I blow my knee out in college,
all I got is credits.

927
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:17,603
If I blow my knee out in the NBA,
I got a four-year guaranteed contract.

928
01:06:17,603 --> 01:06:18,896
Millions.

929
01:06:19,104 --> 01:06:21,648
So, what does she say
when you tell her that?

930
01:06:24,776 --> 01:06:26,487
I can't.

931
01:06:29,490 --> 01:06:31,200
You just don't know my mom, man.

932
01:06:32,326 --> 01:06:34,328
All this because you
can't talk to your mom?

933
01:06:34,328 --> 01:06:36,830
- Can you talk to yours?
- My mom's dead.

934
01:06:40,375 --> 01:06:42,377
But if she wasn't...

935
01:06:48,008 --> 01:06:49,510
Yeah.

936
01:06:50,511 --> 01:06:52,346
I think I could talk to her.

937
01:06:55,390 --> 01:06:57,351
Let me get in there, huh?

938
01:07:05,943 --> 01:07:10,030
You know, a lot of people think
these questions are difficult.

939
01:07:10,948 --> 01:07:13,784
- Not me.
- No?

940
01:07:13,951 --> 01:07:15,494
No.

941
01:07:16,954 --> 01:07:19,414
These questions all have answers.

942
01:07:50,362 --> 01:07:52,573
- We good?
- Yeah.

943
01:07:52,865 --> 01:07:54,825
All right, let's get out of here.

944
01:08:00,122 --> 01:08:03,125
- Roy, what's in your bag?
- Nothing.

945
01:08:07,504 --> 01:08:09,298
I needed some school supplies.

946
01:08:10,007 --> 01:08:13,260
- Roy, you can't take this stuff.
- Why not?

947
01:08:13,510 --> 01:08:15,846
If anything's missing,
Francesca gets busted.

948
01:08:16,013 --> 01:08:18,390
- So?
- Why did you take the guy's photo?

949
01:08:18,515 --> 01:08:22,227
- Dude, his wife is hot. Look.
- Come on, I'll help him take it back.

950
01:08:22,895 --> 01:08:25,522
- We'll wait here.
- Anna and I will be on the roof.

951
01:08:31,403 --> 01:08:33,780
I can't believe it. This is so awesome.

952
01:08:34,281 --> 01:08:36,200
You got your answers.

953
01:08:36,867 --> 01:08:41,914
Yeah, that too, you know,
but it's all of it.

954
01:08:42,372 --> 01:08:44,333
We did it.

955
01:08:46,752 --> 01:08:49,796
We haven't done anything yet.
What's going on with you?

956
01:08:49,963 --> 01:08:52,716
I don't know. I'm having fun, I guess.

957
01:08:52,966 --> 01:08:55,719
I mean, I know how people see me.

958
01:08:56,970 --> 01:09:01,266
Like, one of those perfect girls
that everything always works out for.

959
01:09:02,476 --> 01:09:05,687
I just always wanted to punch
one of them in the face.

960
01:09:08,565 --> 01:09:13,946
I'm not a robot, you know?
I just haven't done very much. Yet.

961
01:09:14,071 --> 01:09:16,949
If it helps, there's a lot of stuff
I haven't done too.

962
01:09:17,366 --> 01:09:20,369
Yeah, but I've never
really done anything.

963
01:09:20,452 --> 01:09:23,205
I mean, I've never broken curfew,

964
01:09:23,455 --> 01:09:28,335
and I've never cut class,
and I've never...

965
01:09:29,461 --> 01:09:31,630
... made out on a rooftop.

966
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:53,110
- Shit.
- What's going on?

967
01:09:53,527 --> 01:09:56,071
- What happened?
- Someone's here.

968
01:09:59,741 --> 01:10:02,161
- Shit.
- All right, grab my hand.

969
01:10:02,494 --> 01:10:05,706
- We'll pull you up.
- Wait, wait, Francesca first. Hold on.

970
01:10:15,841 --> 01:10:18,719
- What's wrong?
- Francesca's not gonna make it.

971
01:10:20,888 --> 01:10:23,307
- We gotta go. We gotta go.
- This shit's wrong.

972
01:10:23,390 --> 01:10:26,310
- We're not gonna leave her.
- We don't have a choice.

973
01:10:26,894 --> 01:10:28,020
- Hell, no.
- I'll go.

974
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:31,190
If you don't get through the skylight,
we all get screwed.

975
01:10:31,523 --> 01:10:33,859
Francesca knew the risk,
so did you. Come on.

976
01:10:34,109 --> 01:10:36,487
- He's right, Des, come on.
- Come on.

977
01:10:37,196 --> 01:10:38,405
This shit is messed up.

978
01:10:40,866 --> 01:10:42,075
Come on.

979
01:10:48,207 --> 01:10:50,334
Come on, Roy, come on.

980
01:10:51,919 --> 01:10:53,879
Come on, come on, come on.

981
01:11:00,928 --> 01:11:02,262
Matt.

982
01:11:04,556 --> 01:11:07,851
- Matt, come on. Matty.
- I'm good.

983
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:11,814
What? Matt, come on.
Give me your hand.

984
01:11:12,064 --> 01:11:15,901
- I'm good, Kyle.
- Matt, what about Sandy?

985
01:11:20,030 --> 01:11:21,782
What about her?

986
01:11:30,499 --> 01:11:32,292
This one's on me.

987
01:11:40,384 --> 01:11:44,054
Hey, hold it right there.
Get your hands up.

988
01:11:57,192 --> 01:12:00,487
Kyle, we gotta go.

989
01:12:11,331 --> 01:12:16,128
- I can't do this. Guys, I can't do this.
- Kyle, Kyle. It's done.

990
01:12:23,343 --> 01:12:25,304
We're gonna use
the keycard to get out.

991
01:12:25,512 --> 01:12:27,431
Desmond and Roy go right.
We go left.

992
01:12:27,598 --> 01:12:30,934
Meet at the car. I'll bring copies of this
in the morning. Come on.

993
01:14:42,816 --> 01:14:44,651
So how'd it go?

994
01:14:44,818 --> 01:14:48,363
- Don't you sleep?
- Not tonight.

995
01:14:48,822 --> 01:14:50,866
Happened to you, kid?

996
01:14:51,325 --> 01:14:54,620
What happened to me?
What happened to you, Larry?

997
01:14:55,078 --> 01:14:57,080
You were supposed
to be my big brother.

998
01:14:57,080 --> 01:15:00,083
- What am I now, the walking dead?
- Well, yeah, pretty much.

999
01:15:00,542 --> 01:15:03,378
I mean, how do you think
Mom and Dad feel?

1000
01:15:03,378 --> 01:15:05,422
I don't know.
How do you think they feel?

1001
01:15:05,881 --> 01:15:08,175
Well, I don't know, Larry.
Not good, probably.

1002
01:15:08,467 --> 01:15:12,137
Let me ask you a question. If you
were a parent, which do you prefer:

1003
01:15:12,137 --> 01:15:15,891
A son who lives above the garage, or
a son who cheats his way into college?

1004
01:15:17,518 --> 01:15:20,979
Next time you pull a heist,
don't leave your plans on my bed, idiot.

1005
01:15:25,651 --> 01:15:27,736
Matty got arrested.

1006
01:15:34,451 --> 01:15:36,203
So, what do you think, fair trade?

1007
01:15:37,788 --> 01:15:39,790
I think that's a shitty thing to ask.

1008
01:15:42,668 --> 01:15:45,629
At least you're starting to sound
like my little brother.

1009
01:15:46,171 --> 01:15:48,674
Maybe he's actually
in there somewhere.

1010
01:15:49,883 --> 01:15:52,344
Is there anything
you don't know, Larry?

1011
01:15:54,012 --> 01:15:56,765
There is plenty I don't know.

1012
01:15:59,017 --> 01:16:01,145
But I'll tell you something
you don't know.

1013
01:16:02,813 --> 01:16:04,565
Did you know

1014
01:16:05,315 --> 01:16:10,571
that every Christmas after you go
to bed, Dad, Mom and I always sit up,

1015
01:16:10,821 --> 01:16:14,074
and we talk about how
proud we are of you?

1016
01:16:15,325 --> 01:16:20,080
How great it is to see this kid, right,
his whole future in front of him.

1017
01:16:20,330 --> 01:16:22,583
And how he deserves that...

1018
01:16:23,834 --> 01:16:27,004
... because he's a good guy
and he does the right thing.

1019
01:16:30,841 --> 01:16:33,260
Every Christmas for how long?

1020
01:16:34,344 --> 01:16:37,556
I don't know, ten years or something.

1021
01:16:38,849 --> 01:16:42,227
You don't think I would like to sit up
with my family on Christmas?

1022
01:16:42,853 --> 01:16:45,564
Yeah, but you'd just stress us out.

1023
01:16:50,652 --> 01:16:52,529
Good night, little brother.

1024
01:16:56,241 --> 01:17:00,204
- Word of advice.
- Why not?

1025
01:17:00,245 --> 01:17:04,041
Never take advice from anyone
who lives above a garage.

1026
01:17:36,406 --> 01:17:39,451
How long
since your mother passed, baby?

1027
01:17:44,456 --> 01:17:48,752
Nine years ago. I was 8.

1028
01:17:50,462 --> 01:17:52,506
That's a shame.

1029
01:17:53,465 --> 01:17:58,262
My son tells me
you encouraged him to talk to me.

1030
01:17:59,930 --> 01:18:05,644
You're a smart boy, Roy. So why are
you doing a stupid thing like drugs?

1031
01:18:08,772 --> 01:18:10,732
Something to do.

1032
01:18:13,068 --> 01:18:14,319
Something to do?

1033
01:18:16,029 --> 01:18:20,075
You know how they say, "Thank God
my mother's not alive to see this"?

1034
01:18:21,368 --> 01:18:23,412
- No.
- Well, somebody's mother is, Roy,

1035
01:18:23,412 --> 01:18:25,289
and I am not happy with this.

1036
01:18:26,415 --> 01:18:28,542
I'm sorry?

1037
01:18:28,917 --> 01:18:33,130
You get yourself a shower
and some clean clothes. We'll wait.

1038
01:18:33,255 --> 01:18:37,593
Fix you some breakfast
before the exam. OK?

1039
01:18:39,636 --> 01:18:43,056
I've been thinking about that, Mrs...

1040
01:18:43,891 --> 01:18:46,226
Desmond's mom.

1041
01:18:47,394 --> 01:18:48,937
I'm not taking that exam.

1042
01:18:50,397 --> 01:18:55,444
I mean, you know, let's face it,
I'm not going to college.

1043
01:18:56,236 --> 01:18:59,448
See, and even if I did,

1044
01:18:59,615 --> 01:19:04,912
I'd just be taking the place of someone
that really wanted to be there

1045
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:06,872
more than me.

1046
01:19:08,624 --> 01:19:10,626
You're a smart boy, Roy.

1047
01:19:10,626 --> 01:19:14,129
But there's a whole lot of dumb
dribbling out of your mouth right now.

1048
01:19:15,839 --> 01:19:20,344
Now, did you hear what I said
about a shower and clean clothes?

1049
01:19:22,262 --> 01:19:24,389
Yes. Yes, ma'am.

1050
01:19:25,265 --> 01:19:28,310
You'll find I don't like
to repeat myself.

1051
01:19:33,941 --> 01:19:37,986
- Get your ass up!
- Yes, ma'am.

1052
01:19:41,031 --> 01:19:42,574
Fool.

1053
01:19:43,784 --> 01:19:45,244
Damn.

1054
01:19:51,875 --> 01:19:55,504
Not everybody can pull it off,
but the dashing-criminal thing

1055
01:19:55,879 --> 01:19:59,132
- looks good on you.
- Yeah? Wait until you smell it.

1056
01:20:02,469 --> 01:20:04,555
You know what I was
thinking in there?

1057
01:20:04,805 --> 01:20:07,015
I need to work on being alone.

1058
01:20:19,695 --> 01:20:21,155
Or not.

1059
01:20:24,491 --> 01:20:26,451
Anyone ever tell you
you're a hell of a kisser?

1060
01:20:26,577 --> 01:20:29,496
- Yeah.
- Not as good as my cellmate, Ramn.

1061
01:20:29,955 --> 01:20:32,166
But it's not bad.

1062
01:20:32,457 --> 01:20:34,501
What about the exam?

1063
01:20:35,002 --> 01:20:36,295
Well, here's the thing.

1064
01:20:36,503 --> 01:20:41,508
After a night in jail with the worst
version of who you can be someday,

1065
01:20:41,508 --> 01:20:43,760
the SAT ain't nothing.

1066
01:20:45,512 --> 01:20:47,931
How about you?
You gonna be all right?

1067
01:20:49,933 --> 01:20:51,393
Yeah.

1068
01:20:52,436 --> 01:20:54,396
I think it's gonna be a nice day.

1069
01:21:08,577 --> 01:21:11,997
Sick And Twisted, SAT.

1070
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:14,458
Secretly A Tease.

1071
01:21:17,628 --> 01:21:21,006
I completely have lost touch
with who you are.

1072
01:21:21,131 --> 01:21:24,802
Unacceptable, Anna. You're out
all night doing God-knows-what

1073
01:21:24,802 --> 01:21:28,096
with God-knows-whom.
You're jeopardizing everything

1074
01:21:28,305 --> 01:21:31,558
that we've worked for on the eve
of the biggest day of your life.

1075
01:21:31,850 --> 01:21:34,269
This is the real world.
You remember that.

1076
01:21:34,353 --> 01:21:37,439
You feel pressured, deal with it.
Feel stressed, deal with it.

1077
01:21:37,856 --> 01:21:40,526
You do not stay out all night.
Do you hear me?

1078
01:21:40,859 --> 01:21:43,987
This is your last chance
to get into Brown.

1079
01:21:44,613 --> 01:21:48,617
Oh, you know what? That reminds me,
I'm not going to Brown.

1080
01:21:51,662 --> 01:21:53,622
Now you deal with it.

1081
01:22:12,266 --> 01:22:15,561
Wow. Check you out.

1082
01:22:17,771 --> 01:22:20,816
I just told my mom
I'm not going to Brown.

1083
01:22:23,110 --> 01:22:25,028
The guys at Brown
will be disappointed.

1084
01:22:25,487 --> 01:22:28,490
Hell, the girls at Brown
are gonna be disappointed.

1085
01:22:29,408 --> 01:22:30,909
If not Brown, where you gonna go?

1086
01:22:30,909 --> 01:22:35,247
I don't know.
Europe, maybe, then college.

1087
01:22:40,961 --> 01:22:42,504
What's up?

1088
01:22:45,048 --> 01:22:46,967
- No.
- Really?

1089
01:22:47,092 --> 01:22:50,846
I already nailed the math,
and plus, you don't know my mom.

1090
01:22:54,975 --> 01:22:59,605
- Roy?
- Shit, man, you don't know D's mom.

1091
01:23:03,775 --> 01:23:06,778
I wanted to go back and get you,
but Kyle said screw y'all.

1092
01:23:07,196 --> 01:23:08,572
Oh, yeah?

1093
01:23:09,364 --> 01:23:11,325
You look like a slut.

1094
01:23:13,619 --> 01:23:15,579
- I like it.
- Thank you.

1095
01:23:17,498 --> 01:23:20,626
- I'm sorry, man.
- Shut up, don't be.

1096
01:23:20,626 --> 01:23:22,085
Besides...

1097
01:23:23,629 --> 01:23:25,380
... it's not that bad.

1098
01:23:28,759 --> 01:23:31,970
- No, I don't need them.
- Come on, man, take them.

1099
01:23:31,970 --> 01:23:33,263
- I'm serious.
- Take them.

1100
01:23:33,305 --> 01:23:36,350
- No, I'm not taking the test again.
- Matt, you got arrested.

1101
01:23:36,934 --> 01:23:38,143
Hey!

1102
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:41,522
Unbelievable. Francesca?

1103
01:23:41,688 --> 01:23:43,774
- No.
- All right, guys, what is this?

1104
01:23:44,274 --> 01:23:48,529
What? I wasn't in it for the answers.
Besides, I got a 1460 last semester.

1105
01:23:49,238 --> 01:23:51,990
- You didn't tell us that.
- You didn't ask.

1106
01:23:53,826 --> 01:23:55,828
Wait. Does this mean
you're out, too, now?

1107
01:23:55,828 --> 01:23:59,039
- Do I look like I need answers?
- You look like you need a pimp.

1108
01:23:59,665 --> 01:24:02,501
Wait, wait. Are you telling
me that after all of this,

1109
01:24:02,501 --> 01:24:04,628
nobody's gonna even
use these answers?

1110
01:24:05,295 --> 01:24:06,839
You are, aren't you?

1111
01:24:10,759 --> 01:24:13,720
- No.
- Kyle, this is your dream, man.

1112
01:24:14,096 --> 01:24:19,810
Yeah, it is, but if they want to put a
number on that, then to hell with them.

1113
01:24:19,810 --> 01:24:21,228
I know who I am.

1114
01:24:22,312 --> 01:24:25,149
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1115
01:24:25,691 --> 01:24:28,861
When did you have this
little moment of clarity?

1116
01:24:29,319 --> 01:24:32,614
About the same time my jackass
best friend got arrested.

1117
01:24:36,577 --> 01:24:38,412
So all of this was for nothing?

1118
01:24:40,330 --> 01:24:42,332
I wouldn't call this nothing.

1119
01:24:51,341 --> 01:24:54,511
Man, screw this.

1120
01:25:12,279 --> 01:25:14,114
You have 30 minutes.

1121
01:25:15,324 --> 01:25:18,035
<i>OK, so I didn't cheat on the test.</i>

1122
01:25:18,327 --> 01:25:21,663
<i>But no way was I gonna
let those answers go to waste.</i>

1123
01:25:21,830 --> 01:25:28,212
<i>Next year at Harvard,
SAT stands for Stoned And Toasted.</i>

1124
01:25:31,423 --> 01:25:35,135
<i>Speaking of college,
Desmond kicked ass on the retest</i>

1125
01:25:35,427 --> 01:25:38,931
<i>and decided to play ball
at St. John's University.</i>

1126
01:25:39,431 --> 01:25:45,145
<i>His mom was happy. And trust me,
you want D's mom happy.</i>

1127
01:25:45,771 --> 01:25:50,317
<i>Matty survived probation and
some serious community service.</i>

1128
01:25:50,776 --> 01:25:54,029
<i>He once told me that he
might like to be an actor.</i>

1129
01:25:54,279 --> 01:25:56,990
<i>If not, then just happy.</i>

1130
01:25:57,241 --> 01:25:59,368
<i>He's working on both.</i>

1131
01:26:00,744 --> 01:26:03,455
<i>Francesca sold her first novel.</i>

1132
01:26:03,789 --> 01:26:08,544
<i>It's about six kids who conspire
to steal the SAT answers.</i>

1133
01:26:08,794 --> 01:26:13,173
<i>If they make a movie out of it,
I wonder who'll play me?</i>

1134
01:26:13,298 --> 01:26:15,843
<i>He better be hung like a horse.</i>

1135
01:26:16,301 --> 01:26:19,680
<i>Kyle did fine on his exam.
Anna crushed him.</i>

1136
01:26:20,139 --> 01:26:25,352
<i>He's in Syracuse, where his dream
of becoming an architect is still alive.</i>

1137
01:26:25,727 --> 01:26:29,106
<i>Anna went off to Europe and
eventually found her way to college</i>

1138
01:26:29,731 --> 01:26:31,233
<i>on her own terms.</i>

1139
01:26:31,233 --> 01:26:33,777
<i>Now, every other weekend
in New York,</i>

1140
01:26:34,236 --> 01:26:36,238
<i>when a woman boards a train
at midnight</i>

1141
01:26:36,238 --> 01:26:38,448
<i>and a man boards that same train,</i>

1142
01:26:39,241 --> 01:26:41,368
<i>now we know what happens.</i>

1143
01:26:41,743 --> 01:26:46,748
<i>Life happens. Romance. Adventure.</i>

1144
01:26:46,748 --> 01:26:49,960
<i>The stuff you won't find on a test.</i>

1145
01:26:50,377 --> 01:26:52,713
<i>I had the highest test score
in the county,</i>

1146
01:26:52,963 --> 01:26:57,217
<i>but that didn't exactly offset
my 0.0 GPA.</i>

1147
01:26:57,468 --> 01:27:02,973
<i>Eventually, I was forced,
I mean, encouraged, to get my GED.</i>

1148
01:27:04,141 --> 01:27:06,935
<i>I still spend most of my time
at home on video games.</i>

1149
01:27:07,144 --> 01:27:12,691
<i>In fact, the number-one-selling game
last year was created by me.</i>

1150
01:27:13,650 --> 01:27:17,946
<i>That's right, baby. Standardize this.</i>

1151
