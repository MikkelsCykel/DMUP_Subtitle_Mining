00:00:18,403 --> 00:00:22,490
I love love
I love being in love

2
00:00:22,574 --> 00:00:25,493
I don't care
what it does to me

3
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:30,915
Sing I love love
I love being in love

4
00:00:30,999 --> 00:00:34,502
I don't care
what it does to me

5
00:00:51,019 --> 00:00:54,939
I love love
I love being in love

6
00:00:55,106 --> 00:00:57,525
I don't care
what it does to me

7
00:00:57,609 --> 00:01:02,614
These pills are fine
to pass the time 'til I find my new drug

8
00:01:02,614 --> 00:01:03,698
We'll take our chances
we'll last a month

9
00:01:06,701 --> 00:01:10,789
We'll never speak again
How I love being in love

10
00:01:10,872 --> 00:01:12,374
May I help you?

11
00:01:12,457 --> 00:01:13,792
Huh? No.

12
00:01:14,626 --> 00:01:17,962
Thank you. Thank you very much.
I'm just browsing.

13
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:21,132
- Thank you.
- So let me guess.

14
00:01:21,174 --> 00:01:22,467
Big night tonight?

15
00:01:23,593 --> 00:01:24,636
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

16
00:01:24,636 --> 00:01:26,972
Yeah, actually. Actually, the biggest.

17
00:01:27,639 --> 00:01:28,640
- Really?
- Yeah.

18
00:01:28,723 --> 00:01:31,226
- Menage a trois?
- Pardon me?

19
00:01:31,309 --> 00:01:32,727
I'm kidding.

20
00:01:33,311 --> 00:01:35,897
Oh, a menage a trois.

21
00:01:36,815 --> 00:01:39,150
French for, "Who's that dude?"

22
00:01:41,653 --> 00:01:44,155
So you're looking
for something for your girl?

23
00:01:44,155 --> 00:01:45,991
Well, not just any girl, okay?

24
00:01:46,074 --> 00:01:50,328
The most...
The most beautiful and incredible

25
00:01:50,328 --> 00:01:52,247
and amazing and...

26
00:01:52,831 --> 00:01:55,500
Well, girl I've ever met.

27
00:01:56,751 --> 00:01:59,838
Okay. Well, if you have any questions,
my name is Claire.

28
00:01:59,921 --> 00:02:03,008
Okay. Actually, yeah.
Does this come in red?

29
00:02:03,758 --> 00:02:08,430
- I can check.
- Also, Claire, does it come any larger?

30
00:02:15,353 --> 00:02:16,980
Much, much larger.

31
00:02:24,863 --> 00:02:25,989
Oh, no.

32
00:02:31,828 --> 00:02:33,621
Hey. Is she in there?

33
00:02:33,705 --> 00:02:35,373
- Yeah, she's in there.
- Good.

34
00:02:35,457 --> 00:02:37,125
How do I look?

35
00:02:37,417 --> 00:02:39,377
I see your balls.

36
00:02:40,045 --> 00:02:44,049
Are you crazy?
Come here. Come here. Up here, up.

37
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:45,133
- What's the matter with you?
- What?

38
00:02:45,216 --> 00:02:46,551
This? This is the big idea?

39
00:02:46,635 --> 00:02:48,887
Yeah. Yeah. She's gonna love it.

40
00:02:48,928 --> 00:02:50,138
- She's gonna hate it.
- She's gonna love it.

41
00:02:50,221 --> 00:02:51,389
- No, she's gonna hate it.
- Love it.

42
00:02:51,389 --> 00:02:53,892
No, she's gonna hate it more than I hate it,
and I really hate it.

43
00:02:53,892 --> 00:02:56,311
You know what your problem is, Ted?
You just...

44
00:02:56,394 --> 00:02:58,396
You don't understand true love.

45
00:02:58,396 --> 00:02:59,648
Oh, and you do?

46
00:02:59,731 --> 00:03:02,484
I understand that there's a girl
that I love waiting for me in there.

47
00:03:02,567 --> 00:03:05,654
And you know what? She loves me, too.

48
00:03:06,154 --> 00:03:07,822
I still see balls.

49
00:03:17,499 --> 00:03:20,001
Can I get you a drink
while you wait for your friend?

50
00:03:24,422 --> 00:03:27,342
Hopefully, in a man's life,
you do this one time.

51
00:03:27,425 --> 00:03:30,512
Well, I want my one time
to be unforgettable.

52
00:03:30,595 --> 00:03:35,266
I want tonight to be a story Vanessa
and me will be telling our grandkids.

53
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:37,686
You almost done with that baby oil?

54
00:03:37,852 --> 00:03:39,437
Yeah. That's it.

55
00:03:39,521 --> 00:03:42,607
Get it in there. Soak those abs.

56
00:03:42,607 --> 00:03:45,694
- I'm gonna kill you.
- Thanks, buddy.

57
00:03:45,777 --> 00:03:47,278
- What's up, ladies?
- Oh, goodness.

58
00:03:49,114 --> 00:03:52,283
There you go, beautiful.
I brought you some c-rations on the house.

59
00:03:52,367 --> 00:03:53,785
Some what?

60
00:03:53,868 --> 00:03:57,956
Oh, sorry. That's Special Forces talk.

61
00:03:58,456 --> 00:04:01,042
Are you in the Special Forces?

62
00:04:01,126 --> 00:04:03,878
That's not something
I'm at liberty to discuss.

63
00:04:09,467 --> 00:04:12,220
Anderson, I sell cars.
My job is to close a deal.

64
00:04:12,304 --> 00:04:15,640
- Trust me. This is not gonna close a deal.
- Give me the ring, Ted.

65
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,559
No. I can't let you do this.

66
00:04:17,809 --> 00:04:19,227
- Give me the ring!
- No.

67
00:04:19,311 --> 00:04:20,395
- Give me the ring, now!
- No.

68
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:21,646
Give me the ring!

69
00:04:27,235 --> 00:04:30,739
Just give me the ring! I just want the ring!
I've got to propose!

70
00:04:30,822 --> 00:04:33,783
Okay. Hey, watch the wings!
Watch the wings!

71
00:04:35,869 --> 00:04:37,746
I'm not gonna lie to you, Vanessa.

72
00:04:38,413 --> 00:04:40,749
Special Ops,

73
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:43,001
it's a deadly game.

74
00:04:44,753 --> 00:04:47,589
But as a very brave person once remarked,

75
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:51,801
"Life is either daring or it's nothing. "

76
00:04:53,011 --> 00:04:55,764
Do you know who that brave person was?

77
00:04:56,264 --> 00:04:59,684
My personal hero, Helen Keller.

78
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:06,775
Helen Keller.

79
00:05:14,532 --> 00:05:18,370
Excuse me, Vanessa.
I think table 16 needs more garlic knots.

80
00:05:27,045 --> 00:05:31,216
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention, please?

81
00:05:32,384 --> 00:05:35,428
I am Cupid, god of love.

82
00:05:37,222 --> 00:05:38,431
Dear God!

83
00:05:39,391 --> 00:05:42,060
Shooter! Shooter! We got a shooter!

84
00:05:42,143 --> 00:05:44,562
Down! Everybody, down!

85
00:05:44,646 --> 00:05:46,231
Down! Down!

86
00:05:51,736 --> 00:05:52,988
Anderson!

87
00:05:53,071 --> 00:05:54,406
You know this perp?

88
00:05:54,489 --> 00:05:56,574
He's my boyfriend.

89
00:05:56,574 --> 00:05:58,660
I didn't know you had a boyfriend.

90
00:05:58,743 --> 00:06:01,246
Anderson, get up! Get up!

91
00:06:01,663 --> 00:06:04,082
You could have gotten yourself killed!

92
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,252
Vanessa, I...

93
00:06:08,837 --> 00:06:10,755
I wrote you a poem.

94
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:28,606
"I am Cupid, god of love

95
00:06:30,442 --> 00:06:32,694
"I come from skies far above

96
00:06:34,112 --> 00:06:36,114
"Bringing love to all I see

97
00:06:37,866 --> 00:06:40,035
"Now I have found some love for me"

98
00:06:40,535 --> 00:06:41,536
Fag.

99
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:46,458
"And so I get on bended knee

100
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:52,797
"To ask, Vanessa, will you marry me?"

101
00:07:04,309 --> 00:07:05,727
Vanessa?

102
00:07:07,312 --> 00:07:09,481
Oh, my God. She's...

103
00:07:10,231 --> 00:07:11,566
Nessy?

104
00:07:30,001 --> 00:07:34,506
I stopped to think about
the bad times that I've had

105
00:07:36,675 --> 00:07:40,011
It puts a smile on my face

106
00:07:43,765 --> 00:07:47,769
Curled up with nothing to do

107
00:07:50,105 --> 00:07:54,859
Why is the sun always out
when I'm feeling blue?

108
00:07:56,528 --> 00:08:01,449
It must be you
Oh, it must be you

109
00:08:03,201 --> 00:08:05,704
It must be you

110
00:08:05,954 --> 00:08:12,127
Oh, it must be you

111
00:08:16,965 --> 00:08:21,636
When I took
my first drink of alcohol

112
00:08:24,222 --> 00:08:28,643
I saw the Angel of Death
floating over us all

113
00:08:30,895 --> 00:08:35,233
With a smile on my face
I just wept

114
00:08:37,569 --> 00:08:42,073
How does a grown man laugh
in the face of death?

115
00:08:43,908 --> 00:08:49,497
It must be you
Oh, it must be you

116
00:10:28,096 --> 00:10:29,139
Hey, you hungry?

117
00:10:36,021 --> 00:10:38,690
Did I ever tell you what she smelled like?

118
00:10:38,815 --> 00:10:40,442
- What?
- Dew drops.

119
00:10:43,528 --> 00:10:46,531
- She was perfect.
- Nobody's perfect.

120
00:10:46,614 --> 00:10:50,869
Okay. Like, you know how most people
have wrinkly knees?

121
00:10:51,369 --> 00:10:54,039
Okay? Hers were perfectly smooth,
like billiard balls.

122
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:56,082
- You know what I used to call her?
- What?

123
00:10:56,124 --> 00:10:59,461
- Billiard ball knees.
- You know what might be fun?

124
00:10:59,544 --> 00:11:02,964
Not talking about your dead girlfriend.
Huh?

125
00:11:03,048 --> 00:11:05,216
I still see her sometimes.

126
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,052
- Here?
- Just forget it.

127
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,428
You know, I'd like to, Anderson,
I really would,

128
00:11:08,553 --> 00:11:09,763
but you won't shut up about it.

129
00:11:10,055 --> 00:11:12,807
She's been dead twice as long
as you knew her. Get over it.

130
00:11:12,891 --> 00:11:15,226
- I'm sorry, "Get over it"?
- Yeah.

131
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:17,729
How do you get over perfection?
How do you get over perfection?

132
00:11:17,812 --> 00:11:19,064
You look around.

133
00:11:19,064 --> 00:11:22,317
Maybe there's
another perfect somebody out there.

134
00:11:32,494 --> 00:11:33,828
Here we go.

135
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:38,416
Don't talk to him like that.
- Eat that goddamn spaghetti.

136
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,085
This is just what the therapist
was talking about.

137
00:11:40,168 --> 00:11:41,920
We're wasting enough money
on that therapist.

138
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,921
I don't believe you.

139
00:11:43,088 --> 00:11:44,756
Who wanted to come here? Not me.

140
00:11:46,174 --> 00:11:49,594
I am so sorry. What did you just do?

141
00:11:49,678 --> 00:11:50,929
What did you do?

142
00:11:51,763 --> 00:11:53,932
Satisfied? I looked around.

143
00:11:54,516 --> 00:11:55,517
I'm just saying,

144
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,686
don't throw your whole life away
'cause you killed your girlfriend.

145
00:11:57,769 --> 00:12:00,105
- Fiancee.
- Technically, she never said yes.

146
00:12:00,188 --> 00:12:02,273
Anyway, I don't know
if you're gonna find anyone else

147
00:12:02,357 --> 00:12:04,442
whose butt smells
like gumdrops or whatever,

148
00:12:04,442 --> 00:12:07,362
but I know you won't unless you try.

149
00:12:07,445 --> 00:12:10,031
So is that it? Is that it, huh?
You want me to try?

150
00:12:10,115 --> 00:12:11,783
One time. That's all I'm saying.

151
00:12:11,783 --> 00:12:14,703
- One time. I try, you get off my back.
- You have my solemn word.

152
00:12:14,786 --> 00:12:15,870
Fine.

153
00:12:16,287 --> 00:12:19,457
Fine, Ted. I'll try. I'll try.

154
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:22,544
Hey. Can I get you guys anything else?

155
00:12:23,628 --> 00:12:25,964
That's what I'm talking about.

156
00:12:27,382 --> 00:12:28,383
Back on the horse.

157
00:12:28,466 --> 00:12:31,303
Is there anything else I can get for you?

158
00:12:33,305 --> 00:12:34,973
Will you marry me?

159
00:12:36,808 --> 00:12:37,976
Excuse me?

160
00:12:37,976 --> 00:12:39,227
Will you marry me?

161
00:12:41,229 --> 00:12:44,649
Stuart, you're flapping...
All right. Pigs? Three little pigs?

162
00:12:44,983 --> 00:12:46,818
A banjo? And piggies?

163
00:12:47,736 --> 00:12:49,321
Deliverance!

164
00:12:49,988 --> 00:12:52,574
- Oh, my gosh! Like a machine.
- Oh, man.

165
00:12:52,657 --> 00:12:55,744
- Oh, my God. Oh, you guys are so fast.
- That was great.

166
00:12:56,077 --> 00:12:58,830
Okay. It's my turn,
and this is a really good one.

167
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:03,501
So I need you all to pay attention.
Especially you, mon amour.

168
00:13:03,501 --> 00:13:05,420
Give me the little hand.

169
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:08,673
- Isn't he the cutest thing ever?
- Hey, I resent that.

170
00:13:09,174 --> 00:13:11,092
Isn't it getting kind of late, you guys?

171
00:13:11,176 --> 00:13:13,345
Oh, what's the matter, Cinderella?

172
00:13:13,345 --> 00:13:16,431
You're not gonna turn into a pumpkin,
are you?

173
00:13:18,099 --> 00:13:21,019
Do I know how to push her buttons,
or what?

174
00:13:21,102 --> 00:13:23,021
I am pushing your buttons.

175
00:13:24,022 --> 00:13:28,360
Honey, do your charade, okay?
I have to get up early tomorrow.

176
00:13:28,443 --> 00:13:29,861
Aye, aye, Captain. Okay.

177
00:13:30,362 --> 00:13:31,863
Oh, wait. We can't do this...

178
00:13:32,947 --> 00:13:34,616
Incoming.

179
00:13:34,699 --> 00:13:37,369
Here we go. Last one.

180
00:13:42,457 --> 00:13:44,626
- Four words. First word.
- Four words. First word.

181
00:13:44,876 --> 00:13:46,795
- Me... Me...
- Shazam.

182
00:13:46,878 --> 00:13:50,048
William! William! Shorter. Willie. Will!

183
00:13:50,131 --> 00:13:51,549
- Will.
- Will. Okay.

184
00:13:51,549 --> 00:13:53,635
- Second word. It sounds like...
- Second word. Sounds like...

185
00:13:53,718 --> 00:13:55,887
- Rockette. Boot. Shoe.
- Shoe.

186
00:13:55,971 --> 00:13:57,222
You.

187
00:14:00,809 --> 00:14:02,227
Fourth word.

188
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:04,062
- Me, it's me again... Me?
- Me?

189
00:14:04,062 --> 00:14:05,480
- Oh, it is "Me. " Okay.
- Will you blank me?

190
00:14:05,563 --> 00:14:07,315
Hey, buddy, there's ladies present.

191
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:09,067
All right, well, you know,
that's just tasteless, Stuart,

192
00:14:09,067 --> 00:14:10,151
- for God's sake.
- Sorry.

193
00:14:10,235 --> 00:14:12,237
All right. Will you blank me?

194
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,738
Third word.

195
00:14:15,407 --> 00:14:16,658
Saunter.

196
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:20,412
- Marry?
- Stuart, he's proposing.

197
00:14:20,495 --> 00:14:23,248
Katie, will you marry me?

198
00:14:25,917 --> 00:14:28,086
Yes! Yes! She says yes!

199
00:14:29,087 --> 00:14:30,588
- Honey?
- Katie!

200
00:14:31,673 --> 00:14:32,674
Katie!

201
00:14:33,758 --> 00:14:34,676
Katie!

202
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:36,511
Honestly, Katherine,

203
00:14:36,594 --> 00:14:39,597
do you have any idea how embarrassing
that was for me last night?

204
00:14:39,597 --> 00:14:42,100
I didn't say no, Mom.
I just said I needed to think about it.

205
00:14:42,183 --> 00:14:43,601
What's there to think about?

206
00:14:43,685 --> 00:14:47,105
That boy is a catch, and he's crazy
about you. God knows why.

207
00:14:47,105 --> 00:14:50,108
Just tell me, what is it you want?
Because William is perfect.

208
00:14:50,191 --> 00:14:52,610
For one thing, he's just about
the most attractive orthodontist

209
00:14:52,694 --> 00:14:53,695
I think I've ever seen.

210
00:14:53,778 --> 00:14:55,113
And he's incredibly romantic.

211
00:14:55,113 --> 00:14:57,949
Mom, I know he's perfect.
I just need a little time.

212
00:14:57,949 --> 00:14:59,701
Will you talk to her, Stuart?

213
00:14:59,784 --> 00:15:01,453
Not to toot my own horn,

214
00:15:01,536 --> 00:15:03,788
but William reminds me a lot of me
when I was younger.

215
00:15:03,872 --> 00:15:05,457
Are you listening to your father?

216
00:15:05,457 --> 00:15:06,624
He is not my father.

217
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:09,294
This man is more of a father to you
than your father ever was,

218
00:15:09,377 --> 00:15:10,378
God rest his soul.

219
00:15:10,462 --> 00:15:13,548
- Dad is not dead.
- He's dead to me, the son of a bitch.

220
00:15:13,632 --> 00:15:15,884
- Don't talk about Dad that way!
- Don't you raise your voice to me!

221
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:18,637
- You're getting emotional, Lois.
- I am not getting emotional!

222
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,890
All right.
I am leaving this house in five minutes,

223
00:15:21,973 --> 00:15:25,810
and if you want to be on that bus,
I suggest you pull yourself together.

224
00:15:29,397 --> 00:15:31,483
Sometimes I wonder if you still love him.

225
00:15:31,566 --> 00:15:32,651
Who?

226
00:15:33,652 --> 00:15:36,571
- Dad.
- Are you crazy? Are you out of your mind?

227
00:15:36,655 --> 00:15:38,573
Well, you must have loved him once.

228
00:15:38,657 --> 00:15:43,244
Honey, I was 18 when I met your father
and about as dumb as a piece of ham.

229
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,998
What did I know about love?
All I knew was...

230
00:15:51,586 --> 00:15:54,589
He was the hottest thing
that I had ever seen.

231
00:15:55,423 --> 00:15:58,677
Oh, he looked like a panther,

232
00:16:00,345 --> 00:16:01,763
a sex panther.

233
00:16:04,182 --> 00:16:05,767
Sounds like love to me.

234
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:10,689
Well, there's a big difference between love
and mindless, animalistic, carnal lust.

235
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,692
And what do you have with Stuart?

236
00:16:14,776 --> 00:16:17,696
What I have with Stuart is what I want
for you and William.

237
00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:21,449
- A mature, stable relationship.
- But are you happy?

238
00:16:21,533 --> 00:16:24,619
Of course I'm happy. I'm very happy.

239
00:16:24,703 --> 00:16:26,538
Very, very happy.

240
00:16:27,205 --> 00:16:29,541
No, no. Very happy.

241
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:31,626
Very happy.

242
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:34,462
- I gotta go. The bus is here.
- All right.

243
00:16:40,552 --> 00:16:41,720
Very happy.

244
00:17:01,406 --> 00:17:04,826
There she is. There's my beautiful girl!

245
00:17:04,909 --> 00:17:07,495
Hey! Keep it down.

246
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:12,083
I will eat your head!
I will tear it off, shove it up your ass,

247
00:17:12,167 --> 00:17:15,587
pull it through your mouth,
brush my teeth with it, and then eat it!

248
00:17:15,587 --> 00:17:17,339
- I will eat it.
- Smitty!

249
00:17:17,422 --> 00:17:19,507
I'm not finished. Eat it!

250
00:17:21,509 --> 00:17:22,927
- Dad.
- What?

251
00:17:23,762 --> 00:17:26,097
- Apologize to him.
- Oh, come on.

252
00:17:26,181 --> 00:17:29,934
I'm serious, Dad. It's just rude. Now.

253
00:17:32,187 --> 00:17:33,772
Do it now, Dad.

254
00:17:36,858 --> 00:17:39,944
Hey, Dave. I'm sorry.

255
00:17:41,946 --> 00:17:43,448
Smitty, I'm working
on my appeal over here.

256
00:17:43,531 --> 00:17:45,784
I know, I know. I'm sorry.

257
00:17:48,286 --> 00:17:52,207
You see, that's why
I love you so much, Baby Bear.

258
00:17:52,332 --> 00:17:54,793
You got your mother's good heart.

259
00:17:57,212 --> 00:17:58,546
What's wrong?

260
00:17:58,588 --> 00:18:01,716
No, nothing.
William asked me to marry him.

261
00:18:01,967 --> 00:18:04,052
But that's good.
That's what you wanted, no?

262
00:18:04,177 --> 00:18:05,387
Yeah.

263
00:18:07,639 --> 00:18:08,640
No.

264
00:18:09,307 --> 00:18:12,143
Oh, Dad, I don't know. I just...

265
00:18:13,895 --> 00:18:17,816
I mean, how are you supposed to know
when you're with the right person?

266
00:18:18,483 --> 00:18:21,152
Just listen to your heart, Baby Bear.

267
00:18:22,487 --> 00:18:23,822
You'll know.

268
00:18:25,323 --> 00:18:28,493
Hey, do you know what I do
when I'm feeling blue?

269
00:18:28,576 --> 00:18:31,246
Yeah. You drink homemade toilet wine.

270
00:18:31,287 --> 00:18:32,497
No!

271
00:18:32,664 --> 00:18:36,793
Well, yeah.
But I also write in my gratitude journal.

272
00:18:36,835 --> 00:18:39,671
And every day, I write about the things
that I have to be grateful for,

273
00:18:39,796 --> 00:18:42,340
like you and your mother.

274
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,093
Oh, here.

275
00:18:46,094 --> 00:18:49,180
"December 25th, Christmas Day.

276
00:18:50,056 --> 00:18:54,019
"I am grateful that somebody finally
stabbed that cocksucker Rodriguez. "

277
00:18:54,394 --> 00:18:55,520
Dad.

278
00:18:59,858 --> 00:19:02,360
I'm gonna say yes.

279
00:19:02,444 --> 00:19:03,486
Yes!

280
00:19:03,528 --> 00:19:06,239
I mean, we get along so well, right?

281
00:19:06,281 --> 00:19:09,284
He's so funny. He cracks me up, you guys.

282
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:13,621
I'm gonna say yes.

283
00:19:13,705 --> 00:19:16,291
That's great. Right, Matador?

284
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:18,376
I think William is kind of a turd.

285
00:19:18,376 --> 00:19:20,545
- Really?
- Yeah.

286
00:19:20,962 --> 00:19:25,383
But he's like a turd
with a piece of candy in it.

287
00:19:31,139 --> 00:19:33,892
Marriage isn't in our blood.
We're circus folk.

288
00:19:34,059 --> 00:19:38,229
Gypsies roaming from big top to big top
on the open road.

289
00:19:39,314 --> 00:19:41,733
You guys have been working in the diner
since I've known you.

290
00:19:41,733 --> 00:19:44,903
Not in here, Katie. Not in here.

291
00:19:51,576 --> 00:19:54,871
Gentlemen, observe.

292
00:20:03,338 --> 00:20:05,757
Can I get you guys anything else?

293
00:20:06,758 --> 00:20:08,426
Will you marry me?

294
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:11,388
- Excuse me?
- Will you marry me?

295
00:20:12,597 --> 00:20:13,640
Seriously.

296
00:20:13,682 --> 00:20:17,519
Think about it.
What could possibly be more romantic

297
00:20:17,602 --> 00:20:20,605
than throwing away your entire life
and running off with some handsome,

298
00:20:20,689 --> 00:20:24,109
dark-haired stranger
you spotted across a restaurant?

299
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:31,032
I'm sorry. He's had a lot of syrup.

300
00:20:32,117 --> 00:20:34,953
- Okay.
- Okay, he's had a lot of syrup?

301
00:20:34,953 --> 00:20:36,454
Okay, I'll marry you.

302
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:40,875
What?

303
00:20:40,959 --> 00:20:42,877
Yes. Yes.

304
00:20:44,296 --> 00:20:45,630
I'll marry you!

305
00:20:46,339 --> 00:20:50,135
Jane! Jane! Will you cover for me?

306
00:20:50,135 --> 00:20:51,219
Where're you going?

307
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:55,807
I'm getting married! To this guy!

308
00:20:57,475 --> 00:20:59,811
Come on. Come on!

309
00:21:00,145 --> 00:21:02,480
Go. Get out of here. I got the bill.

310
00:21:11,656 --> 00:21:12,657
Oh!

311
00:21:13,825 --> 00:21:14,826
Anderson.

312
00:21:15,285 --> 00:21:16,953
- Katie.
- Katie. Hi.

313
00:21:23,335 --> 00:21:24,753
Two kisses.

314
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:29,758
Big rig. Watch this.

315
00:21:31,176 --> 00:21:33,345
Stick that arm up your ass!

316
00:21:46,566 --> 00:21:50,987
Got a brand new roof
above my head

317
00:21:52,113 --> 00:21:56,034
All the empty boxes
thrown away

318
00:21:57,285 --> 00:21:59,788
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah. Yeah.

319
00:22:00,372 --> 00:22:02,832
So years from now,
when we're celebrating

320
00:22:02,874 --> 00:22:05,377
our 37th wedding anniversary

321
00:22:06,962 --> 00:22:10,799
and one of our friends
asks us about our first date,

322
00:22:10,882 --> 00:22:13,051
is this what we'll talk about?

323
00:22:13,468 --> 00:22:16,388
I guess it is. Yeah. Okay.

324
00:22:16,721 --> 00:22:19,724
And... And then I'll tell them
the funny part.

325
00:22:20,058 --> 00:22:21,101
What's the funny part?

326
00:22:21,142 --> 00:22:24,354
That after we talked about it,
you stepped in dog shit.

327
00:22:26,731 --> 00:22:29,734
- Oh! I stepped in dog shit!
- Yeah.

328
00:22:29,818 --> 00:22:31,569
Why didn't you warn me?
You could have warned me.

329
00:22:31,653 --> 00:22:33,655
That would have ruined the story.

330
00:22:33,738 --> 00:22:36,408
Ah, man. Can I borrow your...

331
00:22:36,491 --> 00:22:37,826
Oh, God! Cut it out!

332
00:22:37,909 --> 00:22:39,327
Okay, careful, careful.

333
00:22:49,254 --> 00:22:51,589
I've never been up here before.

334
00:22:51,756 --> 00:22:57,095
Yeah, it's a cool place to come if you want
to get an old refrigerator filled with vomit.

335
00:22:57,595 --> 00:22:59,097
I was looking for one of those.

336
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:01,933
Yeah? Well, I think
it's two-for-one day, so...

337
00:23:04,769 --> 00:23:06,438
Look what I've got.

338
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,691
Tetanus?

339
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,115
- This is stupid.
- What?

340
00:23:17,615 --> 00:23:21,536
You know, this. Us sitting up here,
pretending we're doing something.

341
00:23:21,619 --> 00:23:22,620
It's just stupid.

342
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:24,205
It is, right?

343
00:23:24,289 --> 00:23:26,207
I mean, obviously
we're not getting married.

344
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:27,542
Obviously.

345
00:23:28,376 --> 00:23:31,880
- Strangers don't get married.
- Well, in some cultures they do.

346
00:23:32,297 --> 00:23:34,215
- They do?
- But not ours.

347
00:23:34,299 --> 00:23:36,801
Not ours.
Other cultures, far-away cultures.

348
00:23:37,052 --> 00:23:39,804
The Kalahari bushmen is one example.

349
00:23:39,804 --> 00:23:42,307
- And my parents did. They did.
- They did?

350
00:23:42,307 --> 00:23:43,808
My mom barely knew my dad,

351
00:23:43,808 --> 00:23:45,477
and she got pregnant with me,
and they eloped

352
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:48,396
to this weird little place
called The House of Wedded Bliss

353
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,481
in Atlantic City.

354
00:23:49,564 --> 00:23:50,732
The House of Wedded Bliss?

355
00:23:50,815 --> 00:23:52,400
Yeah.

356
00:23:53,068 --> 00:23:55,236
Doesn't that sound incredibly romantic?

357
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,906
Sounds like a bad Chinese takeout place.

358
00:24:01,326 --> 00:24:05,330
Yeah, well, I mean, just because they did,
doesn't mean that we are, right?

359
00:24:06,581 --> 00:24:10,251
You probably weren't even serious
when you asked.

360
00:24:10,335 --> 00:24:11,670
Were you?

361
00:24:12,837 --> 00:24:14,339
Of course not.

362
00:24:17,342 --> 00:24:20,679
You see, that's what I'm talking about.
I mean, this whole thing is just...

363
00:24:20,762 --> 00:24:21,763
It's stupid.

364
00:24:24,516 --> 00:24:25,767
- Wait.
- I'm sorry.

365
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:27,352
Wait, wait, wait. What's happening?

366
00:24:27,435 --> 00:24:29,020
I'm just such an idiot.

367
00:24:29,521 --> 00:24:30,855
Are you crying?

368
00:24:30,855 --> 00:24:32,857
- No.
- Why are you crying?

369
00:24:34,025 --> 00:24:36,027
I am not crying.

370
00:24:38,196 --> 00:24:40,448
It really looks like you're crying.

371
00:24:40,532 --> 00:24:42,367
Yeah, well, I'm crying now.

372
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:45,787
Are you satisfied, you asshole?

373
00:24:46,871 --> 00:24:48,540
Hey. Hey, hey.

374
00:24:48,707 --> 00:24:51,209
Hey. Hey, you.

375
00:24:52,043 --> 00:24:54,879
Hey! Hey.

376
00:25:00,719 --> 00:25:02,220
Are you okay?

377
00:25:03,972 --> 00:25:08,727
I can't remember the last time I did that.
I don't think I've ever done that.

378
00:25:09,311 --> 00:25:13,148
- Do you want a tissue?
- No, I'm fine. I feel incredible.

379
00:25:13,398 --> 00:25:14,399
Really?

380
00:25:15,317 --> 00:25:16,735
Why is that?

381
00:25:17,736 --> 00:25:20,905
- You sure you don't want a tissue?
- No, I'm fine.

382
00:25:21,573 --> 00:25:25,577
Anderson, when you asked me
to marry you,

383
00:25:26,411 --> 00:25:30,332
you probably picked the only girl
in the whole world that would say yes.

384
00:25:30,415 --> 00:25:33,251
I don't think that's a coincidence, do you?

385
00:25:34,252 --> 00:25:35,420
I don't know.

386
00:25:35,587 --> 00:25:38,006
- Do you believe in fate?
- No.

387
00:25:38,089 --> 00:25:41,760
Neither do I.
You see, this was meant to be.

388
00:25:42,344 --> 00:25:43,511
Will you marry me?

389
00:25:44,846 --> 00:25:47,432
You said yes?
- Yeah. Well, why not?

390
00:25:47,515 --> 00:25:51,853
You know, I think this is exactly
what I need to get my life back on track.

391
00:25:51,936 --> 00:25:53,772
I mean,
why can't two strangers get married?

392
00:25:53,855 --> 00:25:57,609
- I don't know. Because it's retarded?
- Look, you said it yourself.

393
00:25:57,692 --> 00:25:59,944
You said I need to get back out there
and meet people. Right? So...

394
00:26:00,028 --> 00:26:01,946
Yeah, meet! Meet! Not marry!

395
00:26:01,946 --> 00:26:04,866
Why can't you just date her for a while
like a normal human being?

396
00:26:04,949 --> 00:26:06,868
Look, don't worry. Okay? It's not...

397
00:26:06,951 --> 00:26:09,037
You know, it's not like
we're getting married today.

398
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,790
We talked about it,
and we decided to take things slow.

399
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:14,125
- So what's next?
- She's moving in with me.

400
00:26:14,125 --> 00:26:15,126
I gotta go.

401
00:26:17,128 --> 00:26:19,381
Okay. Well, good luck with that.

402
00:26:29,557 --> 00:26:32,143
I don't care
whether you hear this

403
00:26:32,227 --> 00:26:36,648
I don't care if I'm alone
here singing songs to myself

404
00:26:36,731 --> 00:26:40,735
There's nobody else around,
around

405
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:45,657
Meet you up
at the Indian part of the town

406
00:26:45,657 --> 00:26:49,661
The town's shut down,
the people left with their bags

407
00:26:49,661 --> 00:26:52,747
Their kids so there's not
a sound, a sound

408
00:26:54,582 --> 00:26:57,419
But I must get
from there to here

409
00:26:57,502 --> 00:27:02,090
There's a small voice crying
on the other side of the river from here

410
00:27:02,674 --> 00:27:05,510
It's too late
to phone her now

411
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,514
William, I have some weird news.
It's good news for me.

412
00:27:10,265 --> 00:27:14,853
I can't marry you.
I'll explain everything later. I'm so sorry.

413
00:27:14,853 --> 00:27:19,190
I love you... As a friend. Okay, bye.

414
00:27:19,774 --> 00:27:23,028
Just a minute
close your eyes

415
00:27:23,111 --> 00:27:27,782
If we settle
for this compromise I'll stay with you

416
00:27:27,866 --> 00:27:30,285
The river looks
so good tonight

417
00:27:30,368 --> 00:27:32,954
Can I leave a message for 99138?

418
00:27:33,038 --> 00:27:35,957
I don't know
what's with your friend

419
00:27:36,041 --> 00:27:38,126
Phone message, Smitty.

420
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:43,882
She said she'd had enough
of playing games

421
00:27:43,882 --> 00:27:45,634
It's from my daughter.
She's getting married.

422
00:27:45,717 --> 00:27:46,885
Oh, yeah?

423
00:27:46,885 --> 00:27:48,136
It's too bad you're not gonna be there

424
00:27:48,219 --> 00:27:50,472
to walk her down the aisle, big guy.

425
00:28:01,232 --> 00:28:03,568
- What is this?
- I'm getting married!

426
00:28:03,652 --> 00:28:06,154
- No, this.
- It's a diaphragm.

427
00:28:06,237 --> 00:28:09,574
I know what it is. Not in front of...
Please. Please.

428
00:28:09,658 --> 00:28:11,159
- It's her diaphragm.
- Stuart!

429
00:28:11,242 --> 00:28:12,827
- Damn it!
- Jeez.

430
00:28:13,578 --> 00:28:16,247
- Where are you going?
- I told you. I'm getting married.

431
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:21,920
- You said yes!
- Not to William.

432
00:28:22,003 --> 00:28:23,505
Not to William?

433
00:28:25,256 --> 00:28:27,926
His name's Anderson.
I met him a couple of hours ago.

434
00:28:27,926 --> 00:28:29,594
A couple of hours ago?

435
00:28:29,678 --> 00:28:32,597
What kind of... What about William?
What kind of name is Anderson?

436
00:28:32,597 --> 00:28:35,183
- Use your head here, Katie.
- He's black, isn't he?

437
00:28:36,434 --> 00:28:37,936
I have to go.

438
00:28:38,103 --> 00:28:39,688
Don't you think
you're being a little impulsive?

439
00:28:39,771 --> 00:28:44,609
Yes! That is exactly what I'm being.
And guess what? It feels great!

440
00:28:47,195 --> 00:28:49,197
- You ready?
- Oh, my God.

441
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,281
Hi.

442
00:28:50,448 --> 00:28:53,368
Hey, there, dude. You must be Anderson.

443
00:28:53,451 --> 00:28:54,452
- No.
- Matador.

444
00:28:54,536 --> 00:28:57,789
This is my friend, Matador.
He's just giving me a ride.

445
00:28:57,789 --> 00:28:59,624
I like your Jew hat.

446
00:29:07,632 --> 00:29:11,636
Bye, Mom. I'll bring him by
for you to meet him tomorrow!

447
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:40,498
- Can you see?
- No.

448
00:29:40,749 --> 00:29:43,418
No problem.
You know, this happens all the time.

449
00:30:18,203 --> 00:30:19,621
How can you see?

450
00:30:19,704 --> 00:30:23,041
Just be patient!
This will clear up in a second.

451
00:30:23,208 --> 00:30:24,876
Okay, slow down.

452
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:26,878
- What?
- Slow down.

453
00:30:40,225 --> 00:30:43,061
Oh, my! Oh, my!

454
00:30:43,812 --> 00:30:44,813
Oh, my!

455
00:30:46,064 --> 00:30:50,068
I killed that fellow.
I killed that fellow with my car!

456
00:30:54,072 --> 00:30:56,658
- Oh, my God, not again.
- Anderson?

457
00:30:58,743 --> 00:31:00,078
Vanessa?

458
00:31:03,331 --> 00:31:04,332
Anderson?

459
00:31:07,585 --> 00:31:08,837
Vanessa?

460
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:13,675
Am I dead?

461
00:31:14,509 --> 00:31:16,594
You're just unconscious.

462
00:31:16,678 --> 00:31:18,179
Does it hurt?

463
00:31:19,014 --> 00:31:20,181
Not really.

464
00:31:21,266 --> 00:31:22,267
Now does it hurt?

465
00:31:24,185 --> 00:31:25,353
You're getting married?

466
00:31:25,437 --> 00:31:29,024
No! No! No! We're not getting married.
We're just...

467
00:31:29,107 --> 00:31:30,775
We're just moving in together.

468
00:31:30,775 --> 00:31:32,277
I thought you loved me.

469
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:35,864
I do, Vanessa. I do.
I'll never love anybody but you.

470
00:31:37,532 --> 00:31:38,867
- Really?
- Yeah.

471
00:31:39,951 --> 00:31:41,286
Of course.

472
00:31:45,457 --> 00:31:46,958
Then dump her.

473
00:31:53,298 --> 00:31:55,550
Promise me, Anderson.

474
00:31:59,888 --> 00:32:01,306
I promise.

475
00:32:05,977 --> 00:32:08,146
Touch my lightsaber, Luke.

476
00:32:10,065 --> 00:32:11,399
Touch it!

477
00:32:12,734 --> 00:32:14,319
- What is that? What is that?
- It's just ice.

478
00:32:14,402 --> 00:32:15,403
Okay.

479
00:32:20,408 --> 00:32:21,660
Hello.

480
00:32:24,412 --> 00:32:27,916
Katie, would you like
to make the introductions?

481
00:32:31,086 --> 00:32:33,004
I hit you with my car.

482
00:32:33,338 --> 00:32:34,673
This is Matador.

483
00:32:34,756 --> 00:32:35,757
Matador.

484
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,427
Here. I got you a small gift.

485
00:32:40,512 --> 00:32:42,597
I didn't have time to wrap it.

486
00:32:43,932 --> 00:32:45,433
It's a Discman.

487
00:32:46,851 --> 00:32:48,603
This is my Discman.

488
00:32:49,688 --> 00:32:51,856
Did you take this from my drawer?

489
00:32:52,774 --> 00:32:53,858
Yes, I did.

490
00:32:56,194 --> 00:32:57,362
Okay.

491
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:01,866
Matador, could you do me a giant favor?

492
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:03,201
Yeah.

493
00:33:03,284 --> 00:33:08,206
Is there some way that you could not
press your balls into my shin?

494
00:33:10,458 --> 00:33:13,378
- Can do.
- Thank you. Thank you.

495
00:33:13,461 --> 00:33:14,963
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

496
00:33:16,798 --> 00:33:18,133
Are you okay?

497
00:33:18,216 --> 00:33:22,804
Well, I thought he was abrupt,
but I'll be fine.

498
00:33:28,727 --> 00:33:31,062
Yeah, I think... I think I'll be okay.

499
00:33:36,484 --> 00:33:37,736
Matador.

500
00:33:39,487 --> 00:33:42,240
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. Very good.

501
00:33:42,907 --> 00:33:43,825
Okay.

502
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,661
Take care, now.

503
00:33:46,828 --> 00:33:48,163
I will.

504
00:33:49,164 --> 00:33:50,665
He seems nice.

505
00:33:51,583 --> 00:33:54,753
- Does it hurt?
- No, it's fine.

506
00:33:54,836 --> 00:33:58,506
- You're so brave.
- Listen. Listen, Katie...

507
00:33:58,673 --> 00:34:01,259
- Hey, where's your bedroom?
- Bedroom?

508
00:34:01,343 --> 00:34:02,844
Yeah. I need to put this somewhere.

509
00:34:02,927 --> 00:34:05,513
- What's this?
- My clothes.

510
00:34:05,597 --> 00:34:08,266
- Your clothes?
- Yeah, you know, for wearing.

511
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:10,101
Oh, clothes.

512
00:34:10,185 --> 00:34:13,355
Right. I thought you said "cloves. " Cloves.

513
00:34:13,438 --> 00:34:16,024
And I was like,
"Cloves, that's a weird thing to pack. "

514
00:34:16,107 --> 00:34:19,194
Okay, yeah. You found the bedroom.

515
00:34:21,613 --> 00:34:24,282
So, yup. So this... This is the bedroom.
This is the bedroom.

516
00:34:24,282 --> 00:34:26,451
I should probably clean up a little.

517
00:34:26,534 --> 00:34:28,119
Good. Good.

518
00:34:28,203 --> 00:34:31,706
So listen, I was thinking about everything
and how great this is,

519
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:33,959
but it's all happening so fast,
and I was afraid

520
00:34:33,959 --> 00:34:36,294
that maybe you thought it
was happening too fast.

521
00:34:36,378 --> 00:34:37,796
That's what makes it so exciting.

522
00:34:37,879 --> 00:34:41,049
Exactly. Exactly.
That's what I was exactly going to say.

523
00:34:41,132 --> 00:34:42,801
Because personally,
I couldn't be more thrilled.

524
00:34:42,884 --> 00:34:44,219
Well, you seem really nervous.

525
00:34:44,302 --> 00:34:47,639
Really? No, no, no. I don't...
That's weird. I don't get nervous.

526
00:34:47,722 --> 00:34:51,393
I just express joy by sweating on occasion.

527
00:34:51,726 --> 00:34:53,812
- Who's Vanessa?
- Who?

528
00:34:53,895 --> 00:34:56,398
You said "Vanessa"
right before you passed out.

529
00:34:56,481 --> 00:34:58,984
- I did?
- Oh, is this her?

530
00:34:59,317 --> 00:35:02,487
No. No, that's not her.
I don't know who that is.

531
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:05,323
That's... That picture came with the frame.

532
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:07,492
But you're in the picture.

533
00:35:09,661 --> 00:35:12,330
Yeah, there I am, right there. I know.

534
00:35:12,497 --> 00:35:14,916
That's because I used to do
some modeling when I was younger.

535
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,584
- Really?
- Yes, I did.

536
00:35:16,668 --> 00:35:19,087
I did some picture frame modeling

537
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:20,672
back when that whole "regular guy" phase

538
00:35:20,755 --> 00:35:23,341
was sweeping the picture frame
modeling industry.

539
00:35:23,425 --> 00:35:25,343
- That is so cool.
- Yeah.

540
00:35:35,854 --> 00:35:37,856
The telephone's ringing.

541
00:35:42,861 --> 00:35:44,029
Should I get it?

542
00:35:44,029 --> 00:35:46,656
No. No, no, no.
It's my mom. I'll call her back.

543
00:35:46,698 --> 00:35:49,117
- Oh, should I say hi?
- That's okay.

544
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,620
No, really, it's weird.
I mean, I should say hi, right?

545
00:35:51,703 --> 00:35:54,539
No, no. That's... I got it. I got it.

546
00:35:54,539 --> 00:35:57,208
Hello, Mom? Hi. Hi!

547
00:35:57,959 --> 00:36:00,295
Oh, same old, same old.
How are you guys?

548
00:36:00,378 --> 00:36:02,631
If she wants to talk to me,
I'm here.

549
00:36:02,881 --> 00:36:06,301
Yeah, listen. No.
Everything is... Everything is...

550
00:36:06,384 --> 00:36:07,385
Everything is good.

551
00:36:08,053 --> 00:36:09,054
Okay, sweetie.

552
00:36:09,471 --> 00:36:10,472
Yeah.

553
00:36:10,555 --> 00:36:11,556
I gotta go, Mom. I love you.

554
00:36:11,723 --> 00:36:14,893
Yeah. Love you. See you tomorrow, then.

555
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:16,478
Okay. See you tomorrow.

556
00:36:17,896 --> 00:36:19,064
Bye-bye.

557
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,902
How's Anderson?

558
00:36:23,943 --> 00:36:27,322
Fine, I guess.
He says he has a surprise for us.

559
00:36:27,405 --> 00:36:29,491
He's coming over tomorrow.

560
00:36:30,075 --> 00:36:32,077
What's he doing tomorrow?

561
00:36:33,912 --> 00:36:35,080
Coming.

562
00:36:36,456 --> 00:36:37,916
He's what?

563
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,338
Coming.

564
00:36:47,509 --> 00:36:49,844
I can give you what you want

565
00:36:51,513 --> 00:36:52,681
I can make
your heart beat short

566
00:36:52,764 --> 00:36:54,265
I'm scared.

567
00:36:55,266 --> 00:36:57,602
Give me that, little girl.

568
00:36:57,936 --> 00:37:01,856
I'm just a little girl. I'm a little girl.

569
00:37:07,612 --> 00:37:11,032
- Anderson?
- Just a minute! Just a minute.

570
00:37:11,116 --> 00:37:14,369
I can be the sauce
you crave

571
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:18,373
I can spell
what you can't say

572
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:22,961
Chocolate flavored
love theme treat that treats you so mean

573
00:37:22,961 --> 00:37:25,714
Covering your
nights and days

574
00:37:26,881 --> 00:37:30,051
Let me give you
what you'd like

575
00:37:30,885 --> 00:37:33,888
I can make your mouth
run dry

576
00:37:34,723 --> 00:37:38,393
Drink me like a liquor,
c'mon and dip your dipper

577
00:37:38,476 --> 00:37:42,147
Show me
what you're here for, guy

578
00:37:45,525 --> 00:37:48,903
- Anderson? Anderson?
- Coming.

579
00:37:50,196 --> 00:37:51,156
Okay.

580
00:37:52,657 --> 00:37:57,662
Listen. Listen, Katie.
I think you're really neat. Okay, I do.

581
00:37:57,662 --> 00:38:00,123
But I just...

582
00:38:00,165 --> 00:38:04,044
I can't. I can't,
'cause I made a promise to somebody.

583
00:38:04,085 --> 00:38:05,086
And...

584
00:38:06,671 --> 00:38:10,008
"I think you're really neat"? God.

585
00:38:14,971 --> 00:38:20,435
What you want
I can give you what you want

586
00:38:22,604 --> 00:38:28,276
What you want
I can give you what you want

587
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,779
What you want
I can

588
00:38:30,945 --> 00:38:33,490
Oh, God! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry, sorry.

589
00:38:33,531 --> 00:38:35,575
No, Anderson. It's okay.

590
00:38:35,617 --> 00:38:36,701
Turn around.

591
00:38:44,626 --> 00:38:46,503
So what did your mom say?

592
00:38:46,544 --> 00:38:49,130
Oh, yeah. Well, she...

593
00:38:49,214 --> 00:38:54,344
I was thinking that we could go over there
and meet them before we...

594
00:38:54,386 --> 00:38:55,804
Get married?

595
00:38:56,554 --> 00:38:58,765
If you want to put a label on it.

596
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:02,143
Great, 'cause I told my mom
we'd go over to visit her tomorrow, too.

597
00:39:02,227 --> 00:39:04,980
Great. That's great.

598
00:39:05,021 --> 00:39:08,817
I was thinking we could take a bus over
to my folks' house.

599
00:39:08,942 --> 00:39:13,989
- I like buses.
- That's good. 'Cause it's a bus. It's a bus.

600
00:39:17,534 --> 00:39:18,743
Minty.

601
00:39:19,244 --> 00:39:23,164
Well, that's toothpaste for you.
That's just classic toothpaste.

602
00:39:26,584 --> 00:39:27,961
Oh, God!

603
00:39:28,211 --> 00:39:31,506
- It's in my eye! It hurts!
- I'm sorry. I swallowed some. Sorry.

604
00:39:31,589 --> 00:39:32,507
It's really burning.

605
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:34,342
Did you wanna go in...
The bathroom's right there.

606
00:39:34,426 --> 00:39:37,887
- Where?
- Yup, this way. Yes. Yeah, you got it.

607
00:39:38,638 --> 00:39:41,016
Maybe I should go out
and get some saline solution.

608
00:39:41,099 --> 00:39:42,434
No. I'm fine.

609
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:45,020
Yeah, but maybe I should go, you know,

610
00:39:45,103 --> 00:39:47,439
get some saline
or eye drops or something.

611
00:39:47,522 --> 00:39:48,940
No, really.

612
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,861
I'll go get some saline.

613
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:58,116
- Okay. Okay. Okay.
- Okay. Slow down. What's the problem?

614
00:39:58,199 --> 00:40:00,535
I think she wants to have sex with me.

615
00:40:00,785 --> 00:40:02,787
I'm gonna call 911.

616
00:40:02,912 --> 00:40:06,291
I'm so embarrassed.
I mean, I feel like such an idiot.

617
00:40:06,374 --> 00:40:09,794
- Maybe you just came on a little strong.
- Oh, God.

618
00:40:09,878 --> 00:40:12,297
A couple hours ago, she was moving in.

619
00:40:12,464 --> 00:40:13,715
All your problems were solved,

620
00:40:13,798 --> 00:40:15,800
rainbows were shooting out of your ass.
What happened?

621
00:40:16,134 --> 00:40:19,137
Nothing. Nothing. She's great. She's great.
It's just...

622
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:20,221
What?

623
00:40:20,347 --> 00:40:23,642
- What would Vanessa say? Huh?
- Oh, buddy.

624
00:40:23,767 --> 00:40:26,478
I was just trying to be spontaneous,
you know?

625
00:40:26,603 --> 00:40:28,438
He probably thinks I'm such a freak.

626
00:40:28,897 --> 00:40:31,399
No. Trust me. You're not a freak.

627
00:40:31,733 --> 00:40:36,488
Hold on. Help. Help. Help me.

628
00:40:36,571 --> 00:40:38,615
I've got to go. He's here.

629
00:40:40,492 --> 00:40:42,494
- Hi.
- Hi. Hi.

630
00:40:43,495 --> 00:40:46,748
They were out of saline,
so I got you some Q-tips

631
00:40:46,831 --> 00:40:49,000
and some zit cream.

632
00:40:49,417 --> 00:40:52,963
So you can do with that what you please.

633
00:40:54,589 --> 00:40:55,799
How's your head?

634
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,676
- Oh, sorry.
- No, it's okay.

635
00:41:02,263 --> 00:41:03,765
My eye is fine.

636
00:41:04,015 --> 00:41:05,850
Right. How's your eye?

637
00:41:08,061 --> 00:41:09,646
- It's fine.
- Good.

638
00:41:33,211 --> 00:41:34,296
Wow.

639
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,049
- Wowee.
- Wowee dowee doo.

640
00:41:40,885 --> 00:41:43,263
Doowee wowie booby.

641
00:41:46,558 --> 00:41:51,062
Well, I think we better get to bed.
I think it's time for...

642
00:41:51,146 --> 00:41:54,399
Not... I mean, not that kind of bed.
Not that kind of bed.

643
00:41:54,482 --> 00:41:57,235
I mean... I mean, like,
sleepy time. Sleepy bed.

644
00:41:57,861 --> 00:41:58,820
'Cause...

645
00:41:59,237 --> 00:42:02,282
'Cause I... You know.
'Cause your eye and my head and...

646
00:42:02,282 --> 00:42:03,742
Well, if we have
any more physical contact,

647
00:42:03,867 --> 00:42:06,244
I think one of us might actually die. So...

648
00:42:33,438 --> 00:42:36,608
So the weekend
came and went

649
00:42:36,775 --> 00:42:38,360
- I'm sorry. Sorry.
- It's all right.

650
00:42:38,443 --> 00:42:40,612
- Go back to sleep. I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

651
00:42:42,113 --> 00:42:47,285
Sunday afternoon's
a memory

652
00:42:49,621 --> 00:42:52,791
She was just lying there

653
00:42:53,208 --> 00:42:56,878
Sleeping softly in a chair

654
00:43:01,883 --> 00:43:02,884
Are you almost ready?

655
00:43:03,009 --> 00:43:05,303
I told Mom we'd be there in,
like, half an hour.

656
00:43:05,887 --> 00:43:07,806
She's gonna love you!

657
00:43:10,225 --> 00:43:11,643
Fourth word!

658
00:43:14,312 --> 00:43:17,732
You're holding hands.
You're holding hands.

659
00:43:17,816 --> 00:43:19,734
You're with friends. You're skip...

660
00:43:19,818 --> 00:43:22,070
Wizard of Oz! The Wizard of Oz!

661
00:43:25,573 --> 00:43:28,326
Diving? The Greg Louganis Story?

662
00:43:32,664 --> 00:43:34,165
Flashdance!

663
00:43:36,251 --> 00:43:37,669
Airplane!

664
00:43:40,171 --> 00:43:41,172
Him?

665
00:43:41,506 --> 00:43:43,258
Her? When a Man Loves a Woman!

666
00:43:43,341 --> 00:43:44,592
Sound of Music!

667
00:43:44,718 --> 00:43:45,927
Philadelphia!

668
00:43:46,011 --> 00:43:48,138
Deep Throat! Deep Throat!

669
00:43:48,179 --> 00:43:49,848
Oh, sorry.

670
00:43:50,473 --> 00:43:52,183
Okay. You know what?
You know what, dear?

671
00:43:52,183 --> 00:43:54,185
We give up. Why don't you just tell us?

672
00:43:55,687 --> 00:43:58,523
- That was The Apple Dumpling Gang.
- Oh.

673
00:44:03,778 --> 00:44:05,864
It's not an easy one. So...

674
00:44:07,407 --> 00:44:08,366
It was really good.

675
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:11,870
Thanks. Thanks. Thank you.
I'm sorry... Thanks.

676
00:44:11,953 --> 00:44:14,289
- You're so good. Yeah. It was hard.
- I thought it...

677
00:44:14,789 --> 00:44:16,875
- I thought it made sense.
- It was good.

678
00:44:16,958 --> 00:44:18,710
- It was a tough one, so...
- Yeah.

679
00:44:18,793 --> 00:44:23,548
And then a few years ago,
I was in a toy store and I had a thought.

680
00:44:24,382 --> 00:44:29,220
What if there was a line of stuffed animals
specifically for Jewish children?

681
00:44:30,055 --> 00:44:32,682
And that's when the Jewnicorn was born.

682
00:44:35,143 --> 00:44:36,353
Listen.

683
00:44:48,073 --> 00:44:50,492
Well, Anderson, what do you think?

684
00:44:52,786 --> 00:44:53,745
Wow.

685
00:44:55,497 --> 00:44:56,498
Wow.

686
00:44:58,249 --> 00:45:00,085
I think it's very...

687
00:45:05,924 --> 00:45:07,175
Specific.

688
00:45:09,177 --> 00:45:11,262
In a good way, of course.

689
00:45:11,346 --> 00:45:14,140
So, Anderson, what is it you do?

690
00:45:14,182 --> 00:45:16,768
Oh, Anderson's
between jobs right now, Mom.

691
00:45:16,851 --> 00:45:18,186
- Oh, he's between jobs?
- Yeah.

692
00:45:18,269 --> 00:45:19,270
I see.

693
00:45:19,896 --> 00:45:22,774
You know, maybe you'd like
to go downstairs to the basement

694
00:45:22,857 --> 00:45:25,610
and see where Stuart makes
all his little toys.

695
00:45:26,194 --> 00:45:28,113
- Mom, no. Why?
- Well, yeah. Yes, yeah.

696
00:45:28,196 --> 00:45:29,614
Oh, I think he'd be interested.

697
00:45:29,698 --> 00:45:32,200
Especially if you like googly eyes.

698
00:45:32,284 --> 00:45:34,536
- As a matter of fact, I do like googly eyes.
- Okay.

699
00:45:34,619 --> 00:45:37,289
That does it. Follow me, young man.

700
00:45:37,789 --> 00:45:40,125
Santa's not the only one with a workshop.

701
00:45:40,125 --> 00:45:42,961
- Wow.
- What do you think?

702
00:45:51,636 --> 00:45:53,638
- What is this?
- Jewla-Hoop.

703
00:45:54,638 --> 00:46:04,638
