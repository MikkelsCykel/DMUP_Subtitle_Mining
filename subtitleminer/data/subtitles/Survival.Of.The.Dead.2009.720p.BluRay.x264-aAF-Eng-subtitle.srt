<i> The last time I was done counting, </i>

2
00:00:26,513 --> 00:00:28,946
<i> was learned that 53 million
people died each year. </I>

3
00:00:29,627 --> 00:00:32,837
<i> 150 thousand each day and 107 every minute. </i>

4
00:00:33,542 --> 00:00:34,644
<i> That is in normal times. </i>

5
00:00:37,269 --> 00:00:40,083
<i> Now, every one of those dead
gets up and kills a person, </i>

6
00:00:40,913 --> 00:00:43,010
<i> and each of these is
up and kills again. </i>

7
00:00:43,839 --> 00:00:49,676

murder, mayhem, and we ...</i>

<i> guards .... </i>

00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:54,031

body counts, but ...</i>

10
00:00:54,491 --> 00:00:55,662
<i> ... this did not work. </i>

11
00:00:56,451 --> 00:00:57,988
<i> Bring him here. Move. </i>

12
00:00:58,533 --> 00:00:59,928
<i> dead returned to life. </i>

13
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:03,021
<i> We should fear them, but we did not. </i>

14
00:01:04,047 --> 00:01:06,655
<i> They were too easy 
kill, except when they were ...</i>

15
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:08,080
<i> ... your partners. </i>

16
00:01:16,903 --> 00:01:17,946
It's time.

17
00:01:25,554 --> 00:01:27,044
The command in this hole.

18
00:01:28,332 --> 00:01:30,666
You killed D.J. and
now he will kill again.

19
00:01:32,242 --> 00:01:33,172
The fucked up, Lou.

20
00:01:34,546 --> 00:01:35,754
You could not handle it,

21
00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:38,196
but you can do the right thing

22
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:49,899
I can not.

23
00:02:03,912 --> 00:02:04,768
No.

24
00:02:05,835 ---> 00:02:06,946
No.

25
00:02:29,534 --> 00:02:30,393
Everything is there.

26
00:02:30,429 --> 00:02:32,505
- What happens?
- This sucks.

27
00:02:32,702 --> 00:02:33,618
We heard gunshots.

28
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:34,916
I enlisted for this shit.

29
00:02:36,613 --> 00:02:37,638
You'd better streets.

30
00:02:39,972 --> 00:02:40,921
What the hell is it?

31
00:02:42,518 --> 00:02:43,333
Respond.

32
00:02:51,324 --> 00:02:54,040
Lou and I saw how
died elsewhere.

33
00:02:55,221 --> 00:02:56,416
We became assailants.

34
00:02:57,278 --> 00:02:58,637
Stopping people
on the road ...

35
00:02:59,011 --> 00:03:00,488
- Hello.
- ... taking what they had.

36
00:03:01,106 --> 00:03:05,607
- It's nice to see them.
- These were some boys who were filming ...

37
00:03:05,608 --> 00:03:06,650
... A documentary about themselves.

38
00:03:06,864 --> 00:03:09,096
- What about this camera?
- We're making a movie.

39
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:11,653
Ah, that is.

40
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:13,687
That damn movie annoyed me.

41
00:03:14,609 --> 00:03:16,543
- Millions of hits.
- Where is the star?

42
00:03:16,544 --> 00:03:17,954
I earned a very bad reputation ...

43
00:03:18,343 --> 00:03:20,326
- ... between all actors.
- Turn off the camera, son.

44
00:03:20,881 --> 00:03:23,210
I made a fortune with this.

45
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:25,547
Turn it off.

46
00:03:27,294 --> 00:03:29,136
We turned us against the world ...

47
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,833
- Now.
- ... or were looking for a world where ...

48
00:03:31,834 --> 00:03:32,877
... Not have "them."

49
00:03:38,123 --> 00:03:42,544
The Survival of the Dead

50
00:03:45,336 --> 00:03:48,821
PLUM ISLAND, NEAR THE COAST OF DELAWARE

51
00:04:00,509 --> 00:04:03,829
SIX DAYS AFTER THE
WALKING DEAD START

52
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,356
Well, that's another that does not
we will have to worry.

53
00:04:16,357 --> 00:04:17,246
Amen.

54
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:20,061
I would just say a
Amen to end all this.

55
00:04:20,252 --> 00:04:22,050
That too would like.

56
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:23,530
Are you with me then?

57
00:04:23,712 --> 00:04:24,396
- Yes
- Yes, Captain.

58
00:04:24,604 --> 00:04:25,241
You're right.

59
00:04:26,324 --> 00:04:27,023
I'm asking.

60
00:04:27,908 --> 00:04:28,904
Are you with me?

61
00:04:29,698 --> 00:04:31,948
You are being too
strict, as it always has been.

62
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:33,804
Being strict is the
curse of a father.

63
00:04:34,197 --> 00:04:35,670
Rather, the curse of a
daughter, if you ask me.

64
00:04:36,494 --> 00:04:37,341
What if I die?

65
00:04:37,998 --> 00:04:39,460
Would you enough
strict as to finish?

66
00:04:39,962 --> 00:04:42,287
- What if you die?
- Do not be so.

67
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:45,487
No, I'm serious. What
if you die and you get up and walk?

68
00:04:45,938 --> 00:04:48,155
Would we be enough
stringent as to kill again?

69
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:50,186
There would have to,
I shoot myself.

70
00:04:50,643 --> 00:04:51,889
Change a few things.

71
00:04:52,198 --> 00:04:53,452
Death does not change
a person's feelings.

72
00:04:53,995 --> 00:04:55,579
All you can do
is to remember dead

73
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,127
what used to be and
try to do the same.

74
00:04:58,173 --> 00:04:59,468
We go next.

75
00:05:00,856 --> 00:05:01,961
We were alone at home.

76
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,170
We listen to what happened later.

77
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,755
Patrick O'Flynn decided
that the living would

78
00:05:07,756 --> 00:05:10,122
better if the dead
stay dead.

79
00:05:11,338 --> 00:05:14,439
They made a detour around the island
trying to clean things up.

80
00:05:17,049 --> 00:05:18,667
Not everyone was on their side.

81
00:05:19,106 --> 00:05:19,689
Come on.

82
00:05:26,134 --> 00:05:31,231
The army warned that if someone is
forced to fend off an attack

83
00:05:31,232 --> 00:05:33,851
attack to ensure his brain.

84
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:35,275
Any news of the people?

85
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,561
No.

86
00:05:39,118 --> 00:05:41,640
I'm sitting waiting.

87
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:43,128
What, a miracle?

88
00:05:43,686 --> 00:05:47,072
Something has to happen, you
believe what the books say.

89
00:05:48,601 --> 00:05:50,126
Does it say what to do?

90
00:05:50,127 --> 00:05:50,877
I'll fix it.

91
00:05:52,265 --> 00:05:53,062
No scandals.

92
00:05:57,016 --> 00:05:57,838
I do not think anything happen.

93
00:06:07,493 --> 00:06:08,584
Patrick O'Flynn.

94
00:06:09,252 -> 00:06:10,195
Matthew Muldoon.

95
00:06:13,321 --> 00:06:15,001
I know that does not concern me, but ...

96
00:06:18,162 --> 00:06:19,339
Where are your children?

97
00:06:19,986 --> 00:06:20,757
Up there.

98
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:22,466
They're sleeping.

99
00:06:23,201 --> 00:06:26,966
You came to me because one of them had
had an accident a couple of days

100
00:06:27,489 --> 00:06:30,613
Yes, the girl he fell
the bike, so ...

101
00:06:31,163 --> 00:06:31,930
"And the child?

102
00:06:33,553 --> 00:06:37,014
- Why do you ask?
- I hit a car.

103
00:06:38,737 --> 00:06:42,093
Is the child either Matthew or not?

104
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,051
I believe what I say.

105
00:06:45,062 --> 00:06:49,013
- He is ...
- Maybe I should go to see for myself.

106
00:06:52,102 --> 00:06:53,061
It will not go up there.

107
00:06:53,635 --> 00:06:54,562
Beth, I have to do this.

108
00:06:54,885 --> 00:06:57,194
You do not have to do
this, enjoy it.

109
00:06:57,306 --> 00:06:59,029
No, I promise that it is not.

110
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:02,416
Do not want to get up there. I do not want
see what we have become your children. "

111
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,925
He has not become nothing.

112
00:07:04,782 --> 00:07:07,333
It remains only my son.

113
00:07:07,711 --> 00:07:08,669
Do not do that.

114
00:07:11,019 --> 00:07:11,665
Beth.

115
00:07:23,661 --> 00:07:24,708
Oh, my God.

116
00:07:25,573 --> 00:07:27,973
You are stupid. You could
have stopped this.

117
00:07:29,659 --> 00:07:31,697
I could've told the truth.

118
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:34,735
What will you do now? "You will be taken
up there and lie down in bed?

119
00:07:35,106 --> 00:07:37,586
No, I will have to do.

120
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:40,836
If you give me the means.

121
00:08:40,352 --> 00:08:41,348
Get rid of them.

122
00:08:57,133 --> 00:08:58,746
I will, I a.

123
00:09:00,076 --> 00:09:04,310
But I would give my soul
who can do it for me.

124
00:09:05,424 --> 00:09:06,746
Nobody is going to help.

125
00:09:07,489 --> 00:09:09,268
Not this time, not just children.

126
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:23,806
Been sufficient
deaths for a day.

127
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,601
It appears that your kids
I have heard.

128
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:34,075
I said that was enough deaths.

129
00:09:37,851 --> 00:09:40,657
These back belong
initially to O'Flynn.

130
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:43,081
Now, listen.

131
00:09:43,655 --> 00:09:45,455
I am seeking a safe place

132
00:09:45,456 --> 00:09:47,614
where men can
proud to live your life.

133
00:09:49,052 --> 00:09:50,406
We can keep it that way

134
00:09:51,462 --> 00:09:54,541
but only if we
what to do.

135
00:09:54,903 --> 00:09:58,360
Killing our species,
as if we belonged.

136
00:09:58,742 --> 00:10:00,611
Putting the dead sleep,

137
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,739
before we do so to us.

138
00:10:04,101 --> 00:10:05,028
I have faith.

139
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:08,333
Judgement Day will forgive me
and prove that I have reason.

140
00:10:08,805 --> 00:10:10,295
You're wrong, Muldoon.

141
00:10:14,283 --> 00:10:15,248
What will you do with them?

142
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:18,955
Son of Muldoon, my turn to save them.

143
00:10:18,956 --> 00:10:20,000
You can not save a
person who is already dead.

144
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,833
May not be dead.

145
00:10:23,129 --> 00:10:25,598
Maybe they have some kind
disease or something.

146
00:10:26,781 --> 00:10:28,479
Someone will find
the cure for this.

147
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:32,233
It might take 100 years, but
someone will find a cure.

148
00:10:34,061 --> 00:10:37,789
The only families who believe
in it are yours and mine.

149
00:10:38,766 --> 00:10:42,173
So far there has been no stranger.

150
00:10:43,155 --> 00:10:45,739
For me now are
strange, Patrick O'Flynn.

151
00:10:47,818 --> 00:10:48,771
and safe ...

152
00:10:52,062 --> 00:10:53,660
Is everything clear?

153
00:11:01,897 --> 00:11:04,883
Outside, everyone.

154
00:11:23,275 --> 00:11:24,525
What will happen to him?

155
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:27,803
If I'm not going to the opposite ...

156
00:11:29,574 --> 00:11:30,723
... I'll let you be killed himself.

157
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,355
Shamus.

158
00:11:35,323 --> 00:11:36,251
He is my father.

159
00:11:39,273 --> 00:11:41,725
I need to get rid of him.

160
00:11:43,665 --> 00:11:45,720
This island needs to get rid of him.

161
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,885
You can put in a pot.

162
00:12:04,987 --> 00:12:06,110
Who's coming with me?

163
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:08,946
I've been with you a long time, Captain.

164
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:10,299
So I'll keep at his side.

165
00:12:20,425 --> 00:12:21,285
Is that all?

166
00:12:21,637 --> 00:12:22,778
We like it here, Patrick.

167
00:12:23,191 --> 00:12:26,249
We believe the best way
overcome this is here in Plum.

168
00:12:29,318 --> 00:12:30,419
Come on, Janet.

169
00:12:31,776 --> 00:12:33,098
I like it here too, Dad.

170
00:12:34,602 --> 00:12:36,107
"You're leaving now?

171
00:12:36,873 --> 00:12:38,060
I'm not leaving.

172
00:12:39,374 --> 00:12:40,248
You're the one who does.

173
00:12:44,962 --> 00:12:48,653
If you continue to emerge
convicted, none survive.

174
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:11,271
THREE WEEKS LATER

175
00:13:21,555 --> 00:13:23,084
Why are zombies
good at oral sex?

176
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:25,676
Why zombies are good
in oral sex? I do not know.

177
00:13:26,054 --> 00:13:27,860
Because they eat any
thing he put forward.

178
00:13:30,736 --> 00:13:31,518
Did you like that?

179
00:13:37,906 --> 00:13:39,744
Why Zombies
politicians eat?

180
00:13:39,745 --> 00:13:40,327
I do not know.

181
00:13:40,328 --> 00:13:41,371
Professional courtesy.

182
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:49,499
- What?
- Anything is funny.

183
00:13:50,051 --> 00:13:52,245
There was no able to receive
no signal for several days

184
00:13:52,246 --> 00:13:53,157
so now I can.

185
00:13:53,223 --> 00:13:56,143
It sucks, people
wrong are those who die.

186
00:13:56,144 --> 00:13:58,643
Only fools are still alive.

187
00:13:59,603 --> 00:14:01,755
Dead heads, and call them now.

188
00:14:02,238 --> 00:14:03,812
The world is going crazy.

189
00:14:05,421 --> 00:14:06,609
Hi, mommy.

190
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:09,414
Forget it, okay? You're exciting.

191
00:14:09,832 --> 00:14:13,022
Can not stand me here
and not doing anything.

192
00:14:13,618 --> 00:14:14,662
Just give me 5 minutes.

193
00:14:14,769 --> 00:14:16,113
You'll change your life forever.

194
00:14:16,114 --> 00:14:19,233
I have no 5 minutes, man.
No one has lately.

195
00:14:19,701 --> 00:14:20,546
Too bad.

196
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:24,381
What is bad is that
if another bitch in this place.

197
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:37,718
I was walking around,
but no one there.

198
00:14:40,317 --> 00:14:41,113
Turn off that.

199
00:14:41,386 --> 00:14:42,394
That's funny.

200
00:14:42,587 --> 00:14:43,680
Shut it now.

201
00:14:44,251 --> 00:14:45,119
I heard something.

202
00:14:48,348 --> 00:14:49,850
Not far away, come on.

203
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:00,401
Check this out.

204
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:02,912
Perhaps there is money inside.

205
00:15:03,297 --> 00:15:04,809
The money does not make sense anymore.

206
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:07,477
Money always
will be money, my friend.

207
00:15:08,358 --> 00:15:09,940
If you have a lot of money
at the end of the world

208
00:15:10,578 --> 00:15:12,664
is possible that you can
buy a nice condo.

209
00:15:15,641 --> 00:15:16,757
Let's ambush.

210
00:15:17,161 --> 00:15:18,607
We will find four
positions from there.

211
00:15:19,158 --> 00:15:19,850
Make some noise.

212
00:15:20,054 --> 00:15:21,940
- Come on.
- Here.

213
00:15:24,353 --> 00:15:26,492
- After all he had.
- Do you leave it there?

214
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:30,016
I would stay, but did not.

215
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,712
- Certainly not.
- He almost gets your property.

216
00:15:33,341 --> 00:15:34,379
Who is she, your mom?

217
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,280
Shit.

218
00:15:38,374 --> 00:15:39,663
How many are you?

219
00:15:40,182 --> 00:15:41,692
They have enough weapons.

220
00:15:42,379 --> 00:15:43,739
Lay down arms.

221
00:15:44,396 --> 00:15:46,945
You'll have to force me
to lower, Mandrake.

222
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:51,112
Oh, shit.

223
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:53,879
Anything else you want
venture to sign up?

224
00:15:55,068 --> 00:15:56,034
That's good.

225
00:15:57,464 --> 00:15:59,370
I do not like shooting
people do not know.

226
00:15:59,641 --> 00:16:01,649
Oh, maybe we should know.

227
00:16:01,906 --> 00:16:03,724
Who the hell wants to meet you?

228
00:16:04,117 --> 00:16:06,479
- Two.
- Even I can tell you better than that.

229
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,923
- Three.
- Three is company, sir.

230
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:11,382
- Four.
- Four is a crowd.

231
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:12,334
Oh, shit.

232
00:16:15,206 --> 00:16:16,122
What the hell was that?

233
00:16:16,831 --> 00:16:17,473
Oh, that.

234
00:16:18,663 --> 00:16:20,366
That is something that we have fun.

235
00:16:20,982 --> 00:16:21,628
"Fun?

236
00:16:22,012 --> 00:16:23,091
There are zombies out there.

237
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:25,552
We were following.

238
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,708
Oh, God.

239
00:17:15,962 --> 00:17:16,878
Why did you do that?

240
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:19,147
They came after us, like I said.

241
00:17:19,148 --> 00:17:23,770
We were following
so we kill them.

242
00:17:24,399 --> 00:17:25,127
That's right.

243
00:17:25,483 --> 00:17:27,104
There are many ways to kill someone.

244
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:31,444
For example, if I shoot
in the head, I would use this.

245
00:17:32,293 --> 00:17:34,733
If I wanted to cut you in
bits would use this.

246
00:17:35,873 --> 00:17:37,801
Or you want to bust.

247
00:17:39,608 --> 00:17:41,556
If you would like esparcirte through the woods ...

248
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:43,977
... Would use one of these bad boys.

249
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:46,447
But you know one thing

250
00:17:46,705 --> 00:17:50,320
I do not want
do on a rainy day.

251
00:17:50,807 --> 00:17:52,169
It is likely that you do ...

252
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:01,344
Do not shoot, please. Not
I am one of them, I swear.

253
00:18:01,345 --> 00:18:03,220
Kenny, stop.

254
00:18:06,727 --> 00:18:08,376
Just coming up the road.

255
00:18:08,782 --> 00:18:10,842
Too crazy
around to walk alone.

256
00:18:11,436 --> 00:18:13,017
The bad people have bad people.

257
00:18:14,262 --> 00:18:15,335
Are not they yours?

258
00:18:16,602 --> 00:18:17,391
"People scoundrel?

259
00:18:17,873 --> 00:18:19,042
- No.
- Yes

260
00:18:21,377 --> 00:18:22,660
I'm not demanding.

261
00:18:24,755 --> 00:18:26,040
You have to finish your work.

262
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:34,825
You're dangerous, man.

263
00:18:35,164 --> 00:18:36,269
But not as much as me.

264
00:18:37,485 --> 00:18:39,255
You come with us, eh?

265
00:18:43,215 --> 00:18:44,193
Just give me a minute.

266
00:18:57,273 --> 00:18:58,170
What are you doing?

267
00:18:58,733 --> 00:19:01,328
- Did you steal their things?
- No, my stuff, they'd have been stolen.

268
00:19:06,648 --> 00:19:07,485
What do you think?

269
00:19:07,764 --> 00:19:08,986
Maybe we should take this.

270
00:19:09,341 --> 00:19:11,062
It is better to walk in Jeeps.

271
00:19:11,905 --> 00:19:12,889
I need the keys.

272
00:19:13,031 --> 00:19:15,014
One of those dead
the back there should have.

273
00:19:15,579 --> 00:19:16,586
Not anymore.

274
00:19:32,709 --> 00:19:33,984
It makes no sense.

275
00:19:34,554 --> 00:19:36,070
Who would be
stupid enough to

276
00:19:36,072 --> 00:19:37,684
leave a bundle of money
in the middle of nowhere?

277
00:19:37,823 --> 00:19:39,636
"Those guys looked like you geniuses?

278
00:19:43,606 --> 00:19:46,599
One million three hundred
thirty-three U.S. dollars.

279
00:19:47,124 --> 00:19:50,668
- Are you told?
- No, I knew what I had.

280
00:19:53,572 --> 00:19:55,070
Can you give us the key?

281
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:58,583
You can have this key.

282
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:00,402
To start the truck.

283
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,609
I meant that.

284
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:03,951
I think not.

285
00:20:10,096 --> 00:20:14,206
Well, we can not take the
things to this boy. Let's go.

286
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:15,575
Drive.

287
00:20:20,867 --> 00:20:22,471
Hey, Cisco wants to know where we go.

288
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,443
We have two options, "North or south?

289
00:20:26,015 --> 00:20:26,524
South.

290
00:20:27,586 --> 00:20:29,687
- Who made you king?
- Single suggest.

291
00:20:29,894 --> 00:20:30,732
Do not make any suggestion, OK?

292
00:20:30,733 --> 00:20:31,872
To the north, Cisco.

293
00:20:34,118 --> 00:20:35,174
Did you ask why I can?

294
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,923
Go North gives us a good
possibility of obtaining things.

295
00:20:40,622 --> 00:20:41,485
A nowhere.

296
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,559
We do not want anywhere.

297
00:20:43,052 --> 00:20:45,588
We want somewhere
where there is so much shit.

298
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:46,558
Like what?

299
00:20:47,623 --> 00:20:48,921
As an island.

300
00:20:49,573 --> 00:20:51,309
Where will we find an island?

301
00:20:51,507 --> 00:20:53,792
Let me see ... Maybe in the ocean?

302
00:20:54,134 --> 00:20:55,267
Do not get smart, kid.

303
00:20:55,561 --> 00:20:56,126
Sorry.

304
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:00,199
Have you ever heard
of Captain Courageous?

305
00:21:00,493 --> 00:21:01,066
Who?

306
00:21:01,258 --> 00:21:03,060
It is a type.

307
00:21:06,633 --> 00:21:07,670
Are you going to look on the computer?

308
00:21:08,055 --> 00:21:10,400
PC sucks.

309
00:21:10,806 --> 00:21:12,168
I think it's great, everything is there.

310
00:21:12,169 --> 00:21:14,901
That's not great, it is.

311
00:21:22,058 --> 00:21:24,703
Friends, I will
so that simple.

312
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,862
Who is the sailor?

313
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:36,991
... I know many who have
come up with many questions.

314
00:21:37,135 --> 00:21:38,233
They are cannibals.

315
00:21:38,407 --> 00:21:41,180
They can come and join us.

316
00:21:41,795 --> 00:21:42,885
Come to Plum.

317
00:21:43,339 --> 00:21:45,947
It is an island near
the coast of Delaware.

318
00:21:46,277 --> 00:21:47,545
Move out to our island.

319
00:21:47,836 --> 00:21:49,664
It has beautiful scenery
and a prodigious beach.

320
00:21:50,197 --> 00:21:52,737
If they come over here, we
I promise I will be welcome.

321
00:21:52,946 --> 00:21:56,766
It is a small place
small and under control.

322
00:21:57,275 --> 00:21:58,437
This sounds good.

323
00:21:58,662 --> 00:21:59,795
Think about it.

324
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,443
Come here.

325
00:22:03,693 --> 00:22:06,136
It is a trap,
What else can it be?

326
00:22:07,191 --> 00:22:09,284
So this type found
a place to escape.

327
00:22:09,285 --> 00:22:10,638
No zombies who fall behind.

328
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:13,848
Yes and if we find it, let's start
to call people to join us.

329
00:22:14,226 --> 00:22:16,618
All right. What can we lose?

330
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,442
I thought we agreed with
we were better on our own.

331
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,072
Thank God that is far, right?

332
00:22:23,494 --> 00:22:25,582
I do not want to enlist with anyone, Kenny.

333
00:22:27,419 --> 00:22:30,165
What we agreed on, man.

334
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:31,555
Shit.

335
00:22:31,901 --> 00:22:33,575
Shit. Shit. Shit.

336
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:41,844
That was not good.

337
00:22:41,949 --> 00:22:44,175
You should think about something else boy.

338
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:51,947
I never joined up with you
never did with me.

339
00:22:52,354 --> 00:22:53,948
We are together because we know.

340
00:22:54,571 --> 00:22:55,948
I get a shot of yours,

341
00:22:56,306 --> 00:22:57,578
you receive one of mine.

342
00:22:58,422 --> 00:23:00,138
No one will give me a bullet.

343
00:23:00,346 --> 00:23:04,540
Sergeant, the people of this island
is blessed by Uncle Sam.

344
00:23:05,688 --> 00:23:07,055
Maybe it's just ...

345
00:23:08,493 --> 00:23:09,995
... A smart thing.

346
00:23:10,669 --> 00:23:12,041
So where do we go? "North or South?

347
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:15,444
South.

348
00:23:17,155 --> 00:23:18,994
And find the path to the beach.

349
00:24:32,134 --> 00:24:33,673
Oh, I caught a big one.

350
00:25:18,641 --> 00:25:19,841
What the hell was that?

351
00:25:20,294 --> 00:25:21,320
Someone is coming, Captain.

352
00:25:45,934 --> 00:25:47,168
No one around here.

353
00:25:47,606 --> 00:25:49,068
When a place seems so empty.

354
00:25:49,795 --> 00:25:51,041
... It is not at all.

355
00:25:51,892 --> 00:25:52,624
Hello.

356
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:53,772
- Do you see what I mean?
- Nice truck.

357
00:25:55,573 --> 00:25:57,273
They must have a lot of money there.

358
00:25:57,791 --> 00:25:59,235
There's nothing here that we.

359
00:25:59,526 --> 00:26:00,804
We find this
truck on the road.

360
00:26:00,805 --> 00:26:01,849
Another person had already cleared.

361
00:26:02,178 --> 00:26:04,136
It's awful liar, Sgt.

362
00:26:04,554 --> 00:26:06,241
We want to get to Plum Island.

363
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,995
They have come to the wrong location.

364
00:26:08,381 --> 00:26:11,451
We only have one boat
with oars and a motor.

365
00:26:11,624 --> 00:26:12,985
How much you want for the boat motor?

366
00:26:13,173 --> 00:26:16,033
- How are you?
- How much for the other?

367
00:26:16,146 --> 00:26:18,028
- How are you?
- Shit.

368
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,406
They are just old-fashioned thieves.

369
00:26:20,442 --> 00:26:23,051
Attract people here
to steal what they have.

370
00:26:23,567 --> 00:26:25,783
We did well until
who showed you.

371
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:27,142
Dead.

372
00:26:30,356 --> 00:26:33,939
If you do not go now, I'll fly brains.

373
00:26:34,078 --> 00:26:37,129
While we are here,
you will not be able to do that.

374
00:26:40,855 --> 00:26:42,998
Why do not we go from here?

375
00:26:42,999 --> 00:26:46,614
Do not think of leaving here,
TNT road is mined.

376
00:26:46,643 --> 00:26:47,677
Damn.

377
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,645
You can be crazy, but
was not lying.

378
00:26:52,941 --> 00:26:53,732
What do we do?

379
00:26:56,003 --> 00:26:57,054
Yes, there it is.

380
00:26:58,956 --> 00:27:00,146
We can leave that.

381
00:27:00,413 --> 00:27:01,794
I just want the money.

382
00:27:01,846 --> 00:27:04,767
It has never been money,
it's about staying alive.

383
00:27:04,872 --> 00:27:07,966
This tank gives us
opportunity to stay alive.

384
00:27:08,053 --> 00:27:11,004
The truck may be our
savior, but are not on the water.

385
00:27:11,063 --> 00:27:12,473
Someone is going to have to go there ...

386
00:27:12,474 --> 00:27:13,900
... Or me, and turn on that boat.

387
00:27:14,187 --> 00:27:16,345
What if no light?
What if no fuel?

388
00:27:16,502 --> 00:27:20,273
We would have tremendous bad luck
Cisco, driving to the rim.

389
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:27,245
Cisco, I told you back.

390
00:27:27,357 --> 00:27:28,253
I know how to handle a boat.

391
00:27:28,536 --> 00:27:29,365
Do you know how to handle a boat?

392
00:27:29,611 --> 00:27:30,818
Yes, I can try.

393
00:27:31,103 --> 00:27:32,160
No need to try.

394
00:27:32,804 --> 00:27:36,062
Lord, the two and this woman.

395
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,104
Soon will I gain from this.

396
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:40,563
You have more chance to catch you
Ferry that kept pushing me to me.

397
00:27:40,601 --> 00:27:43,800
-5 Minutes dear.
- Yes, yes. Forever changed my life.

398
00:27:44,657 --> 00:27:45,976
Cisco, no.

399
00:27:52,146 --> 00:27:53,397
It is swimming to the ferry

400
00:27:53,398 --> 00:27:54,887
How did we get there?

401
00:27:55,237 --> 00:27:57,424
There must be something better than this truck.

402
00:28:02,192 --> 00:28:02,906
Shit.

403
00:28:22,899 --> 00:28:24,117
Let me see if I can.

404
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:32,306
I think I could get used to this.

405
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:36,008
Shit.

406
00:28:38,315 --> 00:28:40,332
Those damn things
are leaving the fund.

407
00:29:02,391 --> 00:29:03,309
Guys.

408
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:07,602
Guys.

409
00:29:11,106 --> 00:29:12,550
Shit. Get in the truck.

410
00:29:19,068 --> 00:29:19,638
Oh God.

411
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:24,278
He did, Captain.

412
00:30:19,826 --> 00:30:21,632
Come, take this. Toma.

413
00:30:21,924 --> 00:30:22,697
Toma.

414
00:30:40,831 --> 00:30:43,290
- How did you get here?
- Swimming, just like you.

415
00:30:43,977 --> 00:30:46,132
And your gun? It was wet, right?

416
00:30:46,389 --> 00:30:47,977
You should thank me.

417
00:30:49,626 --> 00:30:50,763
It is better to try now.

418
00:30:51,079 --> 00:30:53,128
Try it now, Cisco.
Do you want to do all the work?

419
00:31:01,417 --> 00:31:02,045
You never know.

420
00:31:02,828 --> 00:31:04,116
Sometimes fires and sometimes not.

421
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,613
You're awful cowboy, Pancho.

422
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:07,569
Come on, we have
try to get out of here.

423
00:31:12,564 --> 00:31:13,633
Okay.

424
00:31:16,742 --> 00:31:17,884
Okay.

425
00:31:21,628 --> 00:31:22,816
Turn on the telegraph.

426
00:31:23,587 --> 00:31:26,287
- What is the telegraph?
- That there, put it to the fullest.

427
00:31:32,375 --> 00:31:33,480
The boat moves, Captain.

428
00:31:34,594 --> 00:31:35,843
You should not have much fuel.

429
00:31:40,594 --> 00:31:42,807
Move the truck, Tomboy. Let
addressed.

430
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:45,988
Tomboy.

431
00:31:48,268 --> 00:31:49,368
Where the hell is Tomboy?

432
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:53,087
How can we get this truck
in a boat if nobody is driving?

433
00:31:54,977 --> 00:31:55,822
What do you think, boy?

434
00:32:15,747 --> 00:32:18,036
Jesus, what the hell was that?

435
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:27,219
I do not look at me. Begin
shoot these bastards.

436
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:46,596
Tawdry.

437
00:32:51,768 --> 00:32:52,384
I have you!

438
00:32:54,158 --> 00:32:56,507
I can not believe, no.

439
00:33:06,327 --> 00:33:07,158
Shit.

440
00:33:25,048 --> 00:33:28,763
My children, give them some
seconds before you blow them up.

441
00:33:37,132 --> 00:33:37,608
Thank you.

442
00:33:55,866 --> 00:33:57,011
Okay, I have you.

443
00:33:57,184 --> 00:33:57,889
Come on.

444
00:34:05,947 --> 00:34:06,923
You're looking at me.

445
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,961
If any of the
others would have left him drowning.

446
00:34:09,271 --> 00:34:10,934
In this case I am very lucky.

447
00:34:11,067 --> 00:34:13,726
- Where is Plum?
- This, to the east.

448
00:34:19,898 --> 00:34:21,308
The man says to the east.

449
00:34:21,910 --> 00:34:25,136
Towards the east? Thither
is the Atlantic Ocean.

450
00:34:25,467 --> 00:34:27,310
Yeah, well, hopefully
there is something in between.

451
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:38,143
Everything is ruined.

452
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:40,389
Except this.

453
00:34:48,258 --> 00:34:49,951
You remind me of my daughter.

454
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:52,596
Yes? Is she pretty?

455
00:34:52,868 --> 00:34:53,941
As it concerns me.

456
00:34:54,531 --> 00:34:56,922
Yes? Then it is a matter
so I would like to know.

457
00:34:58,102 --> 00:34:59,083
Oh, you're ...

458
00:34:59,084 --> 00:35:00,127
Oh, yes.

459
00:35:00,308 --> 00:35:01,162
I am ...

460
00:35:01,341 --> 00:35:03,235
- Any problem with that?
- None, none.

461
00:35:05,198 --> 00:35:05,614
You.

462
00:35:06,545 --> 00:35:07,590
I can not help this time.

463
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,912
My name is Patrick O'Flynn.

464
00:35:12,389 --> 00:35:15,039
Leave that tried to kill us.

465
00:35:15,334 --> 00:35:18,137
Well, there is always
resource that can be used.

466
00:35:18,905 --> 00:35:20,805
I could kill you right now
if you wanted.

467
00:35:21,365 --> 00:35:22,188
I also I can kill.

468
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:23,967
Yes, you could, could.

469
00:35:24,415 --> 00:35:26,975
I think just about
Who pulls the trigger first.

470
00:35:31,205 --> 00:35:32,192
Why I like him?

471
00:35:32,737 --> 00:35:36,254
Well, I have said this several times.

472
00:35:36,575 --> 00:35:38,194
We are all on the same side.

473
00:35:38,398 --> 00:35:39,536
The land of the living.

474
00:35:39,982 --> 00:35:42,016
- I'm on your side.
- Yes, but you are.

475
00:35:42,286 --> 00:35:43,628
Just do not know it yet.

476
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:51,743
First things first.

477
00:35:52,411 --> 00:35:55,815
We must ensure that there are no more
of these errant chick on this ship.

478
00:35:56,088 --> 00:35:58,912
I'm not in charge of
you all the time.

479
00:36:00,844 --> 00:36:01,493
Grab.

480
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,161
Want something to eat shit?

481
00:36:08,655 --> 00:36:09,604
Are you okay?

482
00:36:09,944 --> 00:36:11,539
Yes, yes, perfect.

483
00:36:14,156 --> 00:36:15,990
Do not bite when
were swimming, right?

484
00:36:16,129 --> 00:36:17,787
No, I do not bite.

485
00:36:18,027 --> 00:36:20,713
In fact, I ended up with one myself.

486
00:36:21,234 --> 00:36:23,475
One of those things
and I tried to catch me ...

487
00:36:24,956 --> 00:36:26,171
... Tore off one of his fingers.

488
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:28,248
Did you take blood?

489
00:36:28,974 --> 00:36:30,104
No, I do not.

490
00:36:30,992 --> 00:36:32,285
A little water, but ...

491
00:36:32,797 --> 00:36:36,503
... Blood, I do not.

492
00:36:36,851 --> 00:36:38,077
Tomboy, come hither.

493
00:36:38,802 --> 00:36:39,800
Come as quickly as possible.

494
00:37:11,768 --> 00:37:12,914
What we have here?

495
00:37:22,306 --> 00:37:24,026
This is dead in different ways.

496
00:37:24,674 --> 00:37:25,487
I have one here.

497
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,344
It has become intelligent.

498
00:37:57,613 --> 00:37:58,252
"Intelligent?

499
00:37:58,514 --> 00:38:00,216
That thing has reminded
how to start the car.

500
00:38:00,313 --> 00:38:02,342
Yes, but I do not give
Driving License.

501
00:38:06,179 --> 00:38:07,261
I think we've cleaned up.

502
00:38:16,317 --> 00:38:17,197
Thanks for your help.

503
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:23,415
Is there any gain
to kill dead people?

504
00:38:26,833 --> 00:38:29,426
That island that were selling.

505
00:38:29,621 --> 00:38:30,488
Have you been there?

506
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:33,779
Of course, it's a lovely place.

507
00:38:33,948 --> 00:38:34,918
Very charming.

508
00:38:36,187 --> 00:38:38,231
But I'm not welcome.

509
00:38:38,901 --> 00:38:39,783
Why? What did you do?

510
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,623
Nothing to deserve that.

511
00:38:44,654 --> 00:38:46,596
It was not a thief.

512
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:51,722
But these days there
nothing more than thieves who earn

513
00:38:51,723 --> 00:38:55,298
wages to be tremendous
intelligent in his profession.

514
00:38:56,201 --> 00:38:57,923
Never won a wage.

515
00:38:59,652 --> 00:39:02,566
I always did for fun.

516
00:39:03,011 --> 00:39:04,908
Thank God
never had Internet.

517
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:07,875
There are no good thieves.

518
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:15,722
I can not believe that we are ignoring
a guy who is devoted to kill zombies.

519
00:39:17,071 --> 00:39:17,890
Land in sight.

520
00:39:21,156 --> 00:39:21,992
Throw the anchor.

521
00:39:22,228 --> 00:39:24,002
Pull the anchor "? Are not we far away?

522
00:39:24,004 --> 00:39:27,432
Not here. No water
deep near Plum.

523
00:39:28,498 --> 00:39:30,441
Protect the Ferry is better.

524
00:39:31,331 --> 00:39:32,539
Nobody is going to see enter.

525
00:39:54,204 --> 00:39:55,620
Shit.

526
00:40:31,864 --> 00:40:32,440
What did I do?

527
00:40:33,363 --> 00:40:34,008
We gotta go.

528
00:40:34,102 --> 00:40:35,461
We need to get
before dawn.

529
00:40:41,508 --> 00:40:42,852
Enter illegally.

530
00:40:43,656 --> 00:40:44,696
Do not think it's good.

531
00:40:45,212 --> 00:40:47,153
It is better to take it
the wrong way.

532
00:40:47,701 --> 00:40:49,195
They do not like outsiders.

533
00:40:49,883 --> 00:40:51,021
You're not a stranger.

534
00:40:51,111 --> 00:40:53,112
Oh I'm worse, I'm sure.

535
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:54,460
Especially now.

536
00:40:54,974 --> 00:41:00,233
Veras, an unusual number of strangers have
Plum been arriving for weeks.

537
00:41:00,234 --> 00:41:01,778
in boats that I have provided.

538
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:02,881
Launch the network.

539
00:41:03,255 --> 00:41:04,064
Why do it?

540
00:41:04,125 --> 00:41:07,517
Has a gentleman to trouble
believed to be the owner of this place.

541
00:41:07,518 --> 00:41:10,838
And believe it or not, to help people
to find a better place to live.

542
00:41:11,417 --> 00:41:13,274
What happened between that gentleman and you?

543
00:41:14,748 --> 00:41:16,682
We had a little disagreement ...

544
00:41:17,486 --> 00:41:21,022
... About expanding or not
the cemetery of the island.

545
00:41:29,791 --> 00:41:30,817
Come to the front.

546
00:41:31,271 --> 00:41:33,613
Hey, it respects a little, old man.

547
00:41:34,065 --> 00:41:36,053
It's not you, is part of the River.

548
00:41:36,054 --> 00:41:38,342
I refer to this river.

549
00:41:38,849 --> 00:41:41,357
This part always
belonged to the O'Flynn.

550
00:41:41,563 --> 00:41:42,431
The other side ...

551
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:46,461
... Well, I'm sure you know
someone on the other side ... soon.

552
00:41:50,129 --> 00:41:52,196
This year the company expanded
a pest species.

553
00:41:53,324 --> 00:41:55,258
I hope my daughter is here.

554
00:41:55,259 --> 00:41:58,856
I had a kind of
disagreement before leaving.

555
00:41:59,565 --> 00:42:00,980
But she remains one O'Flynn.

556
00:42:01,393 --> 00:42:03,066
It seems that you had
disagreements with the whole world.

557
00:42:04,336 --> 00:42:04,581
Hey.

558
00:42:05,979 --> 00:42:08,356
If a place looks so empty it is likely
it is not at all, is not it?

559
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:11,724
See what I mean?

560
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:16,003
It's only the postman.

561
00:42:16,653 --> 00:42:18,058
It takes several days delivering the mail.

562
00:42:30,855 --> 00:42:31,518
Look.

563
00:42:36,849 --> 00:42:37,588
And there.

564
00:42:39,174 --> 00:42:40,439
See what happens?

565
00:42:40,711 --> 00:42:42,438
Keep them with you, he says.

566
00:42:42,849 --> 00:42:44,747
But in reality they are not.

567
00:42:45,036 --> 00:42:46,788
Not if you keep them chained.

568
00:42:49,355 --> 00:42:50,134
Those are them.

569
00:42:50,135 --> 00:42:50,862
Give me a gun.

570
00:42:52,754 --> 00:42:54,951
Shoot him the bastards.

571
00:42:57,710 --> 00:42:58,423
What bastards?

572
00:42:58,746 --> 00:43:01,038
- Who shot them?
- The Muldoon.

573
00:43:05,737 --> 00:43:07,274
There is only one up there.

574
00:43:08,154 --> 00:43:09,046
Kenny crouch.

575
00:43:09,549 --> 00:43:10,891
Oh, God.

576
00:43:15,037 --> 00:43:15,701
I have it.

577
00:43:16,166 --> 00:43:17,105
Shit.

578
00:43:24,601 --> 00:43:27,453
You said you would receive no
never a bullet from anyone.

579
00:43:29,031 --> 00:43:30,784
That is very easy to say.

580
00:43:33,522 --> 00:43:35,945
You're just an old-timer.

581
00:43:46,107 --> 00:43:46,690
Kenny.

582
00:43:49,884 --> 00:43:50,277
Hey.

583
00:43:52,805 --> 00:43:53,791
Shit, Kenny.

584
00:43:54,637 --> 00:43:55,774
No, no.

585
00:43:59,003 --> 00:44:00,559
Why do you dress?

586
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:04,191
I'm so sorry, man.

587
00:44:04,672 --> 00:44:05,657
I'm sorry.

588
00:44:06,577 --> 00:44:09,295
Why did you dress me?

589
00:44:10,579 --> 00:44:11,281
Damn.

590
00:44:15,408 --> 00:44:17,850
I had to do, you know it well.

591
00:44:17,851 --> 00:44:19,353
You son of a bitch.

592
00:44:33,672 --> 00:44:36,132
- She is beautiful.
- It's dead.

593
00:44:36,675 --> 00:44:37,460
It's my daughter.

594
00:44:39,616 --> 00:44:40,592
Is your daughter?

595
00:44:41,293 --> 00:44:42,065
It was.

596
00:44:42,945 --> 00:44:44,237
Can you hold, please?

597
00:44:54,512 --> 00:44:55,612
Hey, you're right.

598
00:44:56,431 --> 00:44:59,016
How will I be?
I got shot, for heaven's sake.

599
00:45:00,902 --> 00:45:03,043
Given the fact that you
fired, are you okay?

600
00:45:03,079 --> 00:45:04,072
Yes, I think.

601
00:45:04,695 --> 00:45:05,569
Mother of God.

602
00:45:05,921 --> 00:45:07,186
In my property.

603
00:45:09,038 --> 00:45:10,053
All this ...

604
00:45:11,552 --> 00:45:12,733
... Used to be mine.

605
00:45:14,824 --> 00:45:16,145
The land around us.

606
00:45:17,389 --> 00:45:18,285
Even the pine down there.

607
00:45:20,268 --> 00:45:22,050
and anything that was swimming in the river. "

608
00:45:23,363 --> 00:45:24,865
nothing happens on the river now.

609
00:45:28,109 --> 00:45:29,053
Many of them.

610
00:45:35,823 --> 00:45:38,593
These people were killed by
head and then shot them dead.

611
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,261
That woman did not have to be dead.

612
00:45:44,824 --> 00:45:46,433
He asked me not to send here.

613
00:45:46,504 --> 00:45:48,934
After you steal
his last $ 30.

614
00:45:50,541 --> 00:45:52,427
I put on a ship and sent it here.

615
00:45:55,352 --> 00:45:56,827
I never thought I would die.

616
00:46:03,433 --> 00:46:03,976
Bastard.

617
00:46:04,424 --> 00:46:06,345
I should not let it
away with it.

618
00:46:06,797 --> 00:46:07,268
That bastard.

619
00:46:07,448 --> 00:46:10,255
What bastard? Who is this guy?

620
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:12,714
Shamus Muldoon.

621
00:46:13,357 --> 00:46:15,946
We had quarrels
since we were kids.

622
00:46:17,409 --> 00:46:19,464
Does anyone give me more
bullets for this gun?

623
00:46:19,743 --> 00:46:20,597
What will you do?

624
00:46:20,782 --> 00:46:22,424
I have to shoot that son of a bitch.

625
00:46:25,194 --> 00:46:26,253
Not if I come first.

626
00:46:27,736 --> 00:46:29,430
My best friend is lying there dead.

627
00:46:29,804 --> 00:46:32,232
My shoulder seems to burn in
fire and there are plenty of

628
00:46:32,233 --> 00:46:35,067
innocent people dead because
someone decided to do so.

629
00:46:35,681 --> 00:46:38,307
If this someone is the Muldoon
which has been talking ...

630
00:46:40,708 --> 00:46:41,685
... I want a part of that.

631
00:46:43,267 --> 00:46:44,633
I knew we would be on the same side.

632
00:46:45,042 --> 00:46:45,903
Sooner or later.

633
00:46:46,232 --> 00:46:48,021
I'll get to some friends.

634
00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:48,986
I'll go with you.

635
00:46:48,987 --> 00:46:50,184
No, no use.

636
00:46:50,798 --> 00:46:52,847
I'll get some of my team.

637
00:46:53,385 --> 00:46:56,145
There is a cottage half a mile from here.

638
00:46:56,598 --> 00:46:59,365
Wait there, I'll go look
before nightfall.

639
00:46:59,682 --> 00:47:01,020
Bullets.

640
00:47:04,431 --> 00:47:05,641
This is good.

641
00:47:06,204 --> 00:47:06,749
Thank you.

642
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:09,892
I feel sorry for her daughter.

643
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:12,228
It serves no purpose.

644
00:47:37,682 --> 00:47:38,361
Shamus.

645
00:47:39,616 --> 00:47:45,357
Lem, Christ. What are you hiding
smelling like a raccoon in the trash?

646
00:47:45,987 --> 00:47:47,485
I was not snooping, Shamus.

647
00:47:48,879 --> 00:47:50,019
Mr. Chuck sent me.

648
00:47:50,111 --> 00:47:52,572
Stud says that is not right.
It is best to come see.

649
00:47:52,949 --> 00:47:59,308
Damn, what does a man do
to have a moment of peace on this island?

650
00:48:20,669 --> 00:48:21,671
Chuck, you're here.

651
00:48:22,135 --> 00:48:23,890
What else
thought I was going to be?

652
00:48:25,685 --> 00:48:28,598
Lem said you were
having problems.

653
00:48:28,905 --> 00:48:31,968
Oh, yes, I'm trying
prevent these types eat me.

654
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:37,724
A little more upset than usual.

655
00:48:38,119 --> 00:48:39,053
No sir.

656
00:48:51,084 --> 00:48:52,222
Not my hat.

657
00:48:58,208 --> 00:48:58,827
Damn.

658
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:07,455
No more than usual.

659
00:49:20,545 --> 00:49:22,390
They say he is the son of Timothy.

660
00:49:23,053 --> 00:49:23,984
Timothy Skyland.

661
00:49:24,862 --> 00:49:26,123
How long there?

662
00:49:28,265 --> 00:49:29,250
This is her third day.

663
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:31,565
I should have made some progress already.

664
00:49:31,602 --> 00:49:33,145
Puts his head around and bites everything.

665
00:49:33,484 --> 00:49:36,807
If I did not have a shot
head, resembles a man.

666
00:49:37,164 --> 00:49:40,509
But do not just do nothing
to eat that pig.

667
00:49:40,578 --> 00:49:43,022
Maybe not like pork.

668
00:49:47,208 --> 00:49:49,873
Lord, it is no disrespect ...

669
00:49:49,970 --> 00:49:52,707
... But we say we want
keep these people alive

670
00:49:52,708 --> 00:49:56,228
and lately we shooting
like mad dogs.

671
00:49:56,594 --> 00:49:58,498
I think it's necessary.

672
00:49:59,236 --> 00:50:01,150
What about those people?

673
00:50:01,689 --> 00:50:02,878
They are strangers.

674
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:04,140
Homeless.

675
00:50:05,333 --> 00:50:10,202
We have an obligation to protect
their souls, that's what we do.

676
00:50:10,444 --> 00:50:13,689
Protect what is yours,
that is mine, what belongs to everyone.

677
00:50:14,189 --> 00:50:17,923
I provide the security people.

678
00:50:19,696 --> 00:50:22,743
I hope you are the last
to question, Chuck.

679
00:50:23,765 --> 00:50:26,745
I helped you when you came out of the bottom.

680
00:50:27,108 --> 00:50:29,607
I left work in a place of respect.

681
00:50:29,813 --> 00:50:32,226
I have left to work this
ranch like yours.

682
00:50:32,274 --> 00:50:33,101
Not mine.

683
00:50:33,649 --> 00:50:34,681
It is not so easy.

684
00:50:35,283 --> 00:50:36,879
I've helped with everything he has done.

685
00:50:37,186 --> 00:50:40,642
Do not bother me when I
began to care for these stalls.

686
00:50:41,444 --> 00:50:43,878
But that was when the
barn was a barn.

687
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:46,892
Are you still with me, Chuck?

688
00:50:47,875 --> 00:50:49,502
Or do you want to go?

689
00:50:50,616 --> 00:50:51,634
I do not want to go.

690
00:50:55,291 --> 00:50:59,393
Lem, get rid of the boy
and brings home the pork.

691
00:50:59,796 --> 00:51:01,058
Let's make a good dinner.

692
00:51:01,658 --> 00:51:04,310
Go find another
dead head with Chuck.

693
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:06,578
That no other
those idiots you bring.

694
00:51:06,803 --> 00:51:08,027
All are fools.

695
00:51:08,786 --> 00:51:10,492
When a man dies
becomes stupid.

696
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:13,620
I have a dead woman in mind.

697
00:51:13,894 --> 00:51:18,272
One that is intelligent enough
to ride a horse across the island.

698
00:51:20,312 --> 00:51:22,004
You mean the daughter of Patrick O'Flynn.

699
00:51:22,172 --> 00:51:25,530
We must learn from it
to know how he did it.

700
00:51:26,149 --> 00:51:27,478
She could be the chosen one, Chuck.

701
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,525
It could be.

702
00:51:48,008 --> 00:51:49,590
The strange, right?

703
00:51:51,601 --> 00:51:53,026
Yes, it did not work.

704
00:51:53,764 --> 00:51:55,071
It seems that nothing works.

705
00:52:27,741 --> 00:52:28,629
Craps.

706
00:52:32,505 --> 00:52:33,185
Hey.

707
00:52:35,051 --> 00:52:36,170
"Medicine?

708
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:39,666
Thank you.

709
00:52:40,764 --> 00:52:42,803
I have a needle
Do you want the thing?

710
00:52:44,295 --> 00:52:45,498
I do not think that works.

711
00:52:47,412 --> 00:52:50,568
- You are a fool.
- I told you it was okay?

712
00:52:51,462 --> 00:52:52,501
Tremendous asshole.

713
00:52:53,883 --> 00:52:54,936
"Cisco?

714
00:52:59,393 --> 00:53:00,517
"Cisco?

715
00:53:15,646 --> 00:53:16,699
"Cisco?

716
00:53:24,021 --> 00:53:25,116
Cisco.

717
00:53:35,135 --> 00:53:38,222
The dead are everywhere.

718
00:53:38,545 --> 00:53:39,901
This is no different.

719
00:53:40,924 --> 00:53:41,765
I do not know, man.

720
00:53:43,335 --> 00:53:44,986
I do not know why we still here.

721
00:53:47,108 --> 00:53:47,758
Domination.

722
00:53:47,952 --> 00:53:48,690
"Doom?

723
00:53:48,691 --> 00:53:49,780
Domination.

724
00:53:50,275 --> 00:53:51,576
It reminds me of my birth.

725
00:53:52,149 --> 00:53:55,211
In the crap out of Alabama.

726
00:53:56,622 --> 00:53:57,536
In a small town.

727
00:53:58,394 --> 00:54:00,628
All the time people
was sniffing ...

728
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:05,623
... Wanting to know what
were doing every minute of the day.

729
00:54:07,695 --> 00:54:10,638
And to top it off you went out in the
newspaper columns.

730
00:54:11,067 --> 00:54:14,968
When things were you
well you threw the dog.

731
00:54:16,131 --> 00:54:17,810
I like small towns but

732
00:54:19,587 --> 00:54:21,681
small towns
are small people.

733
00:54:22,664 --> 00:54:24,293
But you are not a small person.

734
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:28,418
How tall, 6.2 feet, 6.3?

735
00:54:30,352 --> 00:54:32,990
6.1 half last time.

736
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:35,865
And I do not think there
finished growing yet.

737
00:54:36,586 --> 00:54:37,638
Who knows?

738
00:54:38,425 --> 00:54:40,051
Might become taller than you.

739
00:54:42,450 --> 00:54:43,451
Do you know, son?

740
00:54:46,438 --> 00:54:47,987
You'd better prepare for growth.

741
00:55:03,387 --> 00:55:04,001
Me.

742
00:55:09,195 --> 00:55:10,357
Cisco, Jesus.

743
00:55:10,737 --> 00:55:11,504
Leave me alone.

744
00:55:17,334 --> 00:55:18,904
- Cisco.
- Leave me alone.

745
00:55:26,084 --> 00:55:28,389
It's beautiful, right?

746
00:55:29,777 --> 00:55:30,975
It is a beautiful place to live.

747
00:55:33,015 --> 00:55:33,840
Not to die.

748
00:55:37,294 --> 00:55:39,628
You know what you're
happening, eh, darling?

749
00:55:41,088 --> 00:55:41,728
Yes.

750
00:55:41,999 --> 00:55:44,221
Then go back to the others.

751
00:55:45,728 --> 00:55:46,766
Just say goodbye.

752
00:55:47,196 --> 00:55:48,059
No, Cisco.

753
00:55:52,502 --> 00:55:54,662
Okay, if you want to watch.

754
00:55:54,989 --> 00:55:55,402
No.

755
00:55:56,465 --> 00:55:57,194
My God.

756
00:55:59,034 --> 00:56:00,138
You can not kill yourself.

757
00:56:00,514 --> 00:56:01,992
If you do, you'll burn in hell.

758
00:56:02,266 --> 00:56:03,972
That is something that your God does not forgive.

759
00:56:14,874 --> 00:56:16,243
Finally did, Cisco.

760
00:56:19,658 --> 00:56:21,347
I finally changed
life forever.

761
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:32,076
I'll never forget.

762
00:56:39,326 --> 00:56:40,261
Who the hell are you?

763
00:56:40,576 --> 00:56:41,589
Who the hell are you?

764
00:56:44,033 --> 00:56:44,877
Better than you I am.

765
00:56:45,529 --> 00:56:49,526
Apparently there is a person
you'll want to know.

766
00:56:49,805 --> 00:56:50,470
Lem.

767
00:56:50,998 --> 00:56:51,971
Come on.

768
00:56:51,985 --> 00:56:52,523
No.

769
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:54,970
No, fuck off.

770
00:57:02,964 --> 00:57:03,789
Are you all right.?

771
00:57:07,103 --> 00:57:08,560
I think I need to check this.

772
00:57:09,402 --> 00:57:12,011
Take the first-
aid that is there.

773
00:57:19,417 --> 00:57:20,509
Psamelo.

774
00:57:22,935 --> 00:57:23,707
Shit.

775
00:57:25,579 --> 00:57:26,283
According ...

776
00:57:30,739 --> 00:57:31,650
Damn.

777
00:57:39,511 --> 00:57:40,363
Okay.

778
00:57:46,583 --> 00:57:47,609
Shit.

779
00:57:48,471 --> 00:57:49,160
You forgot the gun.

780
00:57:50,316 --> 00:57:52,015
You're an idiot.

781
00:57:52,961 --> 00:57:53,876
Too high.

782
00:58:36,261 --> 00:58:37,022
Oh, Jesus.

783
00:58:42,985 --> 00:58:43,666
Patrick.

784
00:58:44,616 --> 00:58:46,269
William and I brought my son.

785
00:58:47,629 --> 00:58:51,562
We want to do what you said
we should from the outset.

786
00:58:51,736 --> 00:58:55,587
My Susan was murdered too.

787
00:58:55,659 --> 00:58:56,355
It was bad.

788
00:58:57,812 --> 00:58:58,832
Thanks for coming.

789
00:59:03,728 --> 00:59:04,415
Help!

790
00:59:08,173 --> 00:59:08,845
Bastards.

791
00:59:35,796 --> 00:59:36,876
She did not eat with us?

792
00:59:37,576 --> 00:59:39,261
Women and children have their place.

793
00:59:40,281 --> 00:59:41,922
The children quietly in their beds ...

794
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:43,611
... And women in the kitchen.

795
00:59:45,204 --> 00:59:46,644
Some people do not
would agree with that.

796
00:59:47,208 --> 00:59:48,431
How did you get here?

797
00:59:49,524 --> 00:59:50,150
On a boat.

798
00:59:50,650 --> 00:59:51,806
Did you come alone?

799
00:59:52,461 --> 00:59:53,209
Yes, yes.

800
00:59:53,774 --> 00:59:54,688
Well, it's funny.

801
00:59:55,423 --> 00:59:59,693
Because two of my rancheros
went to the other riverbank.

802
01:00:00,722 --> 01:00:01,885
Only one returned.

803
01:00:03,305 --> 01:00:05,357
He told me that they got
in a shootout with ...

804
01:00:06,456 --> 01:00:07,491
... 6 outsiders.

805
01:00:07,737 --> 01:00:08,723
One was a boy.

806
01:00:08,724 --> 01:00:10,410
4 were dressed like you.

807
01:00:10,928 --> 01:00:14,685
The number 6 was Patrick O'Flynn.

808
01:00:20,936 --> 01:00:23,775
I'm sure
I filled bastard

809
01:00:23,776 --> 01:00:26,813
bad head
thoughts about me.

810
01:00:28,361 --> 01:00:30,488
Well, I was born to be a Muldoon.

811
01:00:33,054 --> 01:00:36,004
At school, my
Muldoon was a teacher.

812
01:00:37,011 --> 01:00:39,394
The good man who brought me
the ranch was a Muldoon.

813
01:00:40,171 --> 01:00:43,970
My priest, which I have the
name, Father Shamus Muldoon.

814
01:00:44,210 --> 01:00:48,624
Please note that all persons
these pictures look a little evil.

815
01:00:48,846 --> 01:00:52,427
That's because all the pictures
were taken after death.

816
01:00:53,329 --> 01:00:57,031
We feel the need
keep them with us.

817
01:00:57,545 --> 01:00:59,967
Just as I am trying to do now.

818
01:01:01,397 --> 01:01:05,312
All I continue to pray for ...

819
01:01:06,247 --> 01:01:08,817
... Keep them with us.

820
01:01:11,190 --> 01:01:16,503
All my life I have led
by the word of the Good Lord.

821
01:01:18,337 --> 01:01:20,695
In their practices.

822
01:01:24,929 --> 01:01:29,629
Everything I do is what
he demands of us.

823
01:01:51,498 --> 01:01:54,097
I will try to urge you ...

824
01:01:56,790 --> 01:01:59,050
to help me exercise
what the Lord asks.

825
01:02:34,916 --> 01:02:37,032
Okay, okay.

826
01:02:38,707 --> 01:02:40,575
I have you, I have.

827
01:02:41,411 --> 01:02:42,508
Come here.

828
01:02:42,623 --> 01:02:43,462
All right.

829
01:02:43,827 --> 01:02:44,918
Okay, baby.

830
01:02:45,286 --> 01:02:46,116
All right.

831
01:02:48,311 --> 01:02:49,233
It's me, Jane.

832
01:02:49,664 --> 01:02:50,391
Me.

833
01:02:53,022 --> 01:02:53,753
Me.

834
01:02:57,110 --> 01:02:57,803
Guys.

835
01:02:58,247 --> 01:02:59,691
Guys, come here ...

836
01:03:00,425 --> 01:03:01,664
Come here.

837
01:03:11,267 --> 01:03:12,303
You're dreaming.

838
01:03:17,128 --> 01:03:17,818
Wake up.

839
01:03:20,501 --> 01:03:22,731
It's her, she is.

840
01:03:24,329 --> 01:03:26,036
You have to wake up.
Arise!

841
01:03:28,253 --> 01:03:29,272
They are two of them.

842
01:03:31,357 --> 01:03:32,640
The one saw was my twin sister.

843
01:03:34,697 --> 01:03:38,152
Jena and Jane, we called the two
Jenas whenever we traveled separately.

844
01:03:39,944 --> 01:03:43,441
Of course there must be more
easier now that Jane is dead.

845
01:03:48,534 --> 01:03:49,757
Where is he now?

846
01:03:50,436 --> 01:03:51,153
My father.

847
01:03:51,154 --> 01:03:51,990
He left.

848
01:03:52,777 --> 01:03:53,561
A little while ago.

849
01:03:54,083 --> 01:03:55,187
To do what?

850
01:03:55,529 --> 01:03:56,577
To meet some friends.

851
01:03:57,298 --> 01:03:58,265
Oh, my God.

852
01:04:02,107 --> 01:04:03,318
What happened to Cisco and a Tomboy?

853
01:04:03,354 --> 01:04:04,187
I do not know.

854
01:04:04,746 --> 01:04:06,059
I have not seen since ...

855
01:04:06,060 --> 01:04:07,220
My father is a liar.

856
01:04:09,261 --> 01:04:10,587
Maybe not a liar.

857
01:04:10,588 --> 01:04:14,451
but my father sees the world in a
one way, against Muldoon.

858
01:04:14,532 --> 01:04:17,385
Both would do whatever
to go to the opposite.

859
01:04:18,971 --> 01:04:20,484
Well, I'm from your old man.

860
01:04:21,152 --> 01:04:21,934
Why?

861
01:04:23,510 --> 01:04:24,536
For many reasons,

862
01:04:25,307 --> 01:04:26,266
should too.

863
01:04:26,996 --> 01:04:28,422
- What reasons?
-'s Your father.

864
01:04:28,598 --> 01:04:31,584
never, never was an appropriate parent ...

865
01:04:31,894 --> 01:04:34,448
and is now back with
you and all your weapons

866
01:04:34,449 --> 01:04:37,103
and is about to begin
World War III.

867
01:04:37,113 --> 01:04:37,948
Hello, daughter.

868
01:04:40,858 --> 01:04:41,773
Hi, Dad.

869
01:04:42,487 --> 01:04:44,007
You do not have to come with us.

870
01:04:45,538 --> 01:04:46,722
It has never been your fight.

871
01:04:52,246 --> 01:04:52,912
Come on.

872
01:04:53,356 --> 01:04:54,157
Right now?

873
01:04:54,242 --> 01:04:55,275
Right now.

874
01:04:55,622 --> 01:04:58,371
- We are waiting for Cisco.
- And Tomboy.

875
01:04:58,800 --> 01:04:59,825
Muldoon has.

876
01:05:00,715 --> 01:05:03,956
Not sure, but it could ensure
also has to that of Mexico.

877
01:05:05,394 --> 01:05:06,613
Are you sure you want to do this?

878
01:05:07,990 --> 01:05:10,477
There is no reason
to do otherwise. Come on.

879
01:05:13,131 --> 01:05:13,631
Dad.

880
01:05:15,914 --> 01:05:17,622
She is very good, huh?

881
01:05:18,426 --> 01:05:19,794
You are very young and I am very old.

882
01:05:19,795 --> 01:05:21,045
She has her trouble, boy.

883
01:05:21,623 --> 01:05:23,513
- We'll see.
- Dad, please.

884
01:05:23,722 --> 01:05:24,648
Come back, baby.

885
01:05:24,724 --> 01:05:27,443
You can not kill. It is the only
why you are still alive.

886
01:05:27,494 --> 01:05:28,014
What?

887
01:05:29,894 --> 01:05:31,715
Be right with you. James.

888
01:05:44,481 --> 01:05:45,704
I always wondered.

889
01:05:46,599 --> 01:05:48,910
Why do not you shoot me this
night when they had a chance?

890
01:05:49,237 --> 01:05:49,955
It was you.

891
01:05:50,572 --> 01:05:51,842
You spoke on my behalf.

892
01:05:52,029 --> 01:05:53,160
And why?

893
01:05:53,985 --> 01:05:56,576
Now you will die
Anyway he.

894
01:05:57,319 --> 01:06:02,409
Shamus Muldoon spat on
the floor that was sacred.

895
01:06:02,479 --> 01:06:06,242
I did 100 times.

896
01:06:06,505 --> 01:06:10,009
And I made the funeral
and I cut the wood and I

897
01:06:10,010 --> 01:06:14,073
bury your wife when
you did not want to see anyone.

898
01:06:15,089 --> 01:06:20,356
On the other hand was Jane, always
Jane was the one in your heart.

899
01:06:21,380 --> 01:06:25,542
She was the only girl in the house
and I the only one who had grown up.

900
01:06:27,350 --> 01:06:31,953
Listen to yourself, you're so
willed as I am.

901
01:06:32,765 --> 01:06:34,709
Of course I loved Jane.

902
01:06:35,363 --> 01:06:37,276
But you too I love you.

903
01:06:37,838 --> 01:06:41,907
Or maybe more, because you are another me.

904
01:06:44,525 --> 01:06:45,784
Return to the house, Janet.

905
01:06:46,051 --> 01:06:48,780
See you there after or not.

906
01:07:04,153 --> 01:07:06,259
Why should we stop
here? Let us cross the bridge.

907
01:07:07,712 --> 01:07:08,793
I have a hunch.

908
01:07:09,722 --> 01:07:11,384
I think there's someone here.

909
01:07:14,225 --> 01:07:16,403
We are waiting
right here, Patrick.

910
01:07:19,112 --> 01:07:19,980
Go away, kid.

911
01:07:20,457 --> 01:07:22,920
Go to the boat, takes the money
of safe and go to live.

912
01:07:28,012 --> 01:07:28,979
Remember this?

913
01:07:31,853 --> 01:07:32,790
Now, get out of here.

914
01:07:51,586 --> 01:07:53,438
Do not shoot, guys.

915
01:07:53,502 --> 01:07:57,566
Not necessary, it is good meat.

916
01:07:57,671 --> 01:08:00,273
I dead head by
and then I take care of the rest.

917
01:08:00,376 --> 01:08:02,685
Yes, and Muldoon kill your friend.

918
01:08:03,147 --> 01:08:03,680
No.

919
01:08:04,655 --> 01:08:06,073
I owe something to that girl.

920
01:08:11,876 --> 01:08:13,535
Lay down your guns, boys.

921
01:08:20,743 --> 01:08:21,957
"You look at me?

922
01:08:24,255 --> 01:08:25,644
Come across the bridge.

923
01:08:25,853 --> 01:08:28,791
All of you. Leave behind their weapons.

924
01:08:39,697 --> 01:08:41,370
Hurry.

925
01:09:00,572 --> 01:09:01,899
- Hey, you okay?
- Yes

926
01:09:02,173 --> 01:09:05,202
- Where is Cisco?
- Is in Heaven.

927
01:09:06,282 --> 01:09:08,414
Telling the Virgin Mary
you can change your life.

928
01:09:08,451 --> 01:09:10,389
This may interest you. Patrick.

929
01:09:10,499 --> 01:09:11,973
Look there.

930
01:09:16,642 --> 01:09:19,180
We tried this with
many dead heads.

931
01:09:19,814 --> 01:09:20,704
Lord.

932
01:09:20,705 --> 01:09:23,509
We have been fed
rabbits, hares, pigs.

933
01:09:24,041 --> 01:09:26,428
This time we
try something bigger.

934
01:09:27,096 --> 01:09:29,375
Because you are now here, Patrick,

935
01:09:29,776 --> 01:09:31,597
I thought maybe you could
to understand

936
01:09:31,598 --> 01:09:33,142
I've been trying to do.

937
01:09:33,916 --> 01:09:36,257
Trying to keep
the fallen with us.

938
01:09:36,539 --> 01:09:41,849
I could not do so unless
that may have something to eat.

939
01:09:42,154 --> 01:09:43,222
It is important ...

940
01:09:43,962 --> 01:09:46,784
... Not just for us
but for the rest of the world.

941
01:09:47,244 --> 01:09:50,870
God will send us all to
hell and the devil is possible

942
01:09:50,871 --> 01:09:54,254
we back again
if we do the right thing.

943
01:09:54,673 --> 01:09:58,348
Chuck, bring them out of the barn.

944
01:09:58,586 --> 01:10:00,166
Let them see what happens.

945
01:10:00,401 --> 01:10:02,524
Who knows? You may learn something.

946
01:10:05,499 --> 01:10:06,363
Guys.

947
01:10:12,343 --> 01:10:13,477
Oh, Christ.

948
01:10:27,303 --> 01:10:29,046
Look at this, Patrick.

949
01:10:29,615 --> 01:10:32,325
Your daughter will not take even a
bite of this animal.

950
01:10:32,548 --> 01:10:34,949
Admit that I have
right after all.

951
01:10:35,178 --> 01:10:36,694
That's what I always wanted.

952
01:10:37,039 --> 01:10:38,971
Admit that I have right ...

953
01:10:40,109 --> 01:10:41,178
.. and you're wrong.

954
01:10:41,786 --> 01:10:46,943
You have that and you and your kids can go.

955
01:10:48,173 --> 01:10:49,815
Thanks for the offer, Shamus,

956
01:10:51,773 --> 01:10:53,086
but I can not go.

957
01:10:54,854 --> 01:10:56,842
Not without having resolved
what brought me here.

958
01:10:57,787 --> 01:10:58,677
What?

959
01:10:59,110 --> 01:11:00,370
Well, first ...

960
01:11:01,083 --> 01:11:02,755
... I have not killed yet.

961
01:11:05,301 --> 01:11:06,969
I imagined a little different.

962
01:11:08,319 --> 01:11:09,687
Well, well.

963
01:11:10,064 --> 01:11:16,306
I will sit down to enjoy
eyes and see what happens.

964
01:11:55,218 --> 01:11:57,761
What would you do with a million dollars?

965
01:12:15,883 --> 01:12:19,230
My sister never will
do anything on that horse.

966
01:12:25,756 --> 01:12:26,504
What can we do?

967
01:12:27,408 --> 01:12:29,867
I brought this. The left thrown away.

968
01:12:30,616 --> 01:12:32,183
But I do not want to start a war.

969
01:12:32,528 --> 01:12:35,243
I do not want, I just want
have some answers.

970
01:12:36,966 --> 01:12:38,172
What happens there?

971
01:12:38,981 --> 01:12:40,170
It's me, Chuck.

972
01:12:45,864 --> 01:12:47,331
I brought up arms again.

973
01:12:48,545 --> 01:12:49,992
What did you do now?

974
01:12:50,318 --> 01:12:52,393
Now, we all have guns.

975
01:12:53,031 --> 01:12:56,054
The first to pull the trigger
will cause a river of blood.

976
01:12:56,189 --> 01:12:58,484
- Very fast.
- Let it go.

977
01:12:58,602 --> 01:12:59,151
No.

978
01:13:00,834 --> 01:13:02,009
I do not want to go.

979
01:13:03,595 --> 01:13:08,092
It looks like your father
determined to stay with me.

980
01:13:08,358 --> 01:13:11,844
As I have determined
stay here with him.

981
01:13:12,095 --> 01:13:13,781
Nobody here is going to kill anyone.

982
01:13:14,188 --> 01:13:15,469
With or without you.

983
01:13:24,970 --> 01:13:25,480
Hey.

984
01:13:26,818 --> 01:13:29,606
You will not want to
start shooting.

985
01:13:30,681 --> 01:13:31,903
We have this.

986
01:13:34,019 --> 01:13:34,695
Shit.

987
01:13:37,317 --> 01:13:40,278
Well, Mr. Muldoon

988
01:13:42,355 --> 01:13:44,371
Looks like someone is hiring me.

989
01:13:47,825 --> 01:13:48,395
Chuck.

990
01:13:50,459 --> 01:13:52,066
Chuck, where are the hell are you going?

991
01:13:53,058 --> 01:13:54,749
Nobody challenges me.

992
01:14:03,799 --> 01:14:04,942
She wants something.

993
01:14:06,311 --> 01:14:07,053
To me.

994
01:14:08,825 --> 01:14:09,827
She knows me.

995
01:14:12,902 --> 01:14:13,760
Jane.

996
01:14:34,570 --> 01:14:35,762
Bitch.

997
01:14:36,932 --> 01:14:39,435
Fucking bitch.

998
01:14:56,419 --> 01:14:57,961
I've been bitten, Dad.

999
01:14:59,042 --> 01:15:00,964
This is your fault, Muldoon.

1000
01:15:04,147 --> 01:15:05,810
He escapes, stupid.

1001
01:15:09,895 --> 01:15:10,786
Come, come, come.

1002
01:15:21,672 --> 01:15:23,058
You can not stop this.

1003
01:15:23,546 --> 01:15:25,082
I can kill now.

1004
01:15:27,753 --> 01:15:28,753
For nothing in this world.

1005
01:15:42,048 --> 01:15:42,899
Come to me.

1006
01:15:43,747 --> 01:15:44,732
Come to me.

1007
01:15:45,553 --> 01:15:46,396
This way.

1008
01:15:47,202 --> 01:15:48,216
Over here.

1009
01:15:48,901 --> 01:15:50,738
Come on. This is for you, Muldoon.

1010
01:15:57,954 --> 01:15:59,120
Son of a bitch.

1011
01:16:19,047 --> 01:16:20,296
Come on.

1012
01:16:23,936 --> 01:16:25,683
This is your fault, Muldoon.

1013
01:16:31,516 --> 01:16:32,820
Let's go, guys.

1014
01:19:05,931 --> 01:19:07,518
Stop already.

1015
01:19:09,390 --> 01:19:11,099
I've got one bullet, Muldoon.

1016
01:19:11,139 --> 01:19:12,705
Come on, I'm waiting.

1017
01:19:21,967 --> 01:19:23,496
I've got one too.

1018
01:19:24,273 --> 01:19:25,371
Say you were wrong.

1019
01:19:26,507 --> 01:19:28,597
Say you were wrong and
I've always been right.

1020
01:19:28,829 --> 01:19:29,227
Reasons?

1021
01:19:30,451 --> 01:19:32,969
Does any of this sounds good?

1022
01:19:33,784 --> 01:19:34,340
Dad.

1023
01:19:36,526 --> 01:19:38,438
I have seen all dying around me.

1024
01:19:39,974 --> 01:19:41,005
Now I'm dying.

1025
01:19:43,669 --> 01:19:45,670
I can not believe that you also die.

1026
01:19:51,021 --> 01:19:57,912
Shamus, I mean several
things about how I think.

1027
01:19:58,963 --> 01:20:02,475
Now if you'll excuse me, I
spend time with my daughter.

1028
01:20:08,423 --> 01:20:09,450
No.

1029
01:20:11,994 --> 01:20:13,173
Bastardo, Muldoon.

1030
01:20:48,501 --> 01:20:49,235
It's over.

1031
01:20:54,466 --> 01:20:55,147
Come on.

1032
01:20:55,909 --> 01:20:56,553
Move.

1033
01:21:16,211 --> 01:21:17,010
She did.

1034
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:42,469
I've got one bullet.

1035
01:21:46,916 --> 01:21:49,875
Wait, wait.

1036
01:21:51,284 --> 01:21:52,103
It happened.

1037
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:54,112
What happened?

1038
01:21:55,015 --> 01:21:56,203
My sister, she ...

1039
01:22:02,562 --> 01:22:04,260
She said I would not be
strict enough.

1040
01:22:05,324 --> 01:22:07,004
She was all I had.

1041
01:22:09,399 --> 01:22:09,992
I did.

1042
01:22:10,772 --> 01:22:11,757
Was it not so?

1043
01:22:12,908 --> 01:22:13,610
Are you okay?

1044
01:22:14,297 --> 01:22:18,595
Well, good luck.

1045
01:22:23,610 --> 01:22:24,208
Come on.

1046
01:22:29,667 --> 01:22:30,741
Here is a boat.

1047
01:22:39,346 --> 01:22:40,120
Look.

1048
01:22:40,735 --> 01:22:43,071
There is a world out there
and no money.

1049
01:22:43,073 --> 01:22:45,518
The reason why
came up here because

1050
01:22:45,519 --> 01:22:48,065
we thought we'd
than anywhere else.

1051
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:50,094
Although it can be.

1052
01:22:50,390 --> 01:22:52,804
What makes you think that there
end up like these idiots?

1053
01:22:53,656 --> 01:22:55,192
Yes, who knows?

1054
01:22:55,825 --> 01:22:58,450
You and I can finish
firing at one of these.

1055
01:22:58,632 --> 01:23:02,090
Yeah boy, that will
when you are done growing.
