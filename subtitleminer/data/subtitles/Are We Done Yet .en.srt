00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:51,188
You know, a lot has changed
in my life in the past year.

2
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:52,949
Suzanne and I got married...

3
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,993
...and her and the kids moved
into my apartment.

4
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:59,029
My very small apartment.

5
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:06,495
But that ain't all.

6
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:08,664
I decided to pursue my dream.

7
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:12,436
So I sold my sports shop
and started up a magazine.

8
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:15,604
You know what it is.
A sports magazine.

9
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:18,250
And these are the moments
that I cherish.

10
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:22,514
When everybody's asleep,
I got the whole place to myself...

11
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:25,453
...and now it's time to get to work.

12
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:49,172
So, Magic, how was it when you...?

13
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,681
How's your magazine coming?

14
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:53,912
Come here.

15
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:55,918
Kevin, what you doing up?
Trying to write.

16
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:58,523
I'm hungry.
Do you got Pop-Tarts?

17
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:00,582
You're always hungry.

18
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,888
And it's, "Do we got Pop-Tarts?"
We family now.

19
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:06,759
So, what's mine is yours,
and what's yours is mine.

20
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:10,027
-Understand?
-I understand I want Pop-Tarts.

21
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:16,104
Thanks, Nick.

22
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:20,870
Did you take my cell phone?

23
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:26,476
Mom, Kevin's stealing
my stuff again.

24
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:27,710
Nick, Coco's hungry.

25
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,720
Hey, you guys wanted the dog,
you gonna have to feed him.

26
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:31,914
Coco, breakfast!

27
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,787
-Good morning.
-Hey.

28
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:38,760
How's your writing
going this morning?

29
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:41,331
-Not too good.
-Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

30
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:44,800
Nick, there's something
we really need to talk about.

31
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:47,030
Hold that thought.
Hey! No! Wait a minute.

32
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:49,265
No! No! No!

33
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:50,736
Open this door.

34
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,434
I have to put on my makeup, Nick.

35
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:54,705
You're too young to wear makeup.

36
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:56,576
Now, I'm gonna count to three.

37
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:57,943
One.

38
00:06:58,117 --> 00:06:59,414
Two.

39
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:07,087
I'm almost 1 4, Nick.
You can't keep treating me Iike a child.

40
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,591
No, no. You're only 1 3.

41
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:11,229
And as your stepfather,
I have the God-given right...

42
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:12,830
...to treat you Iike a child.

43
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,761
Suzanne, do you see
what this girl got on?

44
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:17,299
I'm not in it.

45
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:21,167
Okay, okay, I am not dressing
Iike somebody's grandma.

46
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,901
After school, Ashley and I are going to
the mall for the Nordstrom sale.

47
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:28,470
No. No. Veto.
That ain't gonna happen.

48
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:29,808
I don't Iike that one bit.

49
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:32,041
You're too young
to be hanging out at the mall.

50
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:33,981
So go get dressed, granny.

51
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:36,053
Too young for the mall?

52
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:38,690
You're Iike a prison guard.

53
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:42,619
Yeah, well, welcome to AIcatraz.

54
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:51,134
So, Nick, you know,
the Lutskys are moving.

55
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:54,168
-So?
-Well, it's a three-bedroom.

56
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,968
Yeah, it's probably three times
as expensive too.

57
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,337
Hey!

58
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:05,411
Oh, you wanna be treated Iike a adult?
You can't even wrap a piece of pizza.

59
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:06,950
You said I was a child.

60
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:11,014
Nick, there's something that we really
need to talk about this morning.

61
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:14,716
I can't talk right now.
Look at me. I'm a mess.

62
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,151
Kevin.

63
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,493
Okay. Out. Both you guys. Out.

64
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,793
I got a presentation today
with my publisher.

65
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:26,962
-Let's go. I need to talk to your mother.
-You too, Coco. Get out. Go.

66
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:28,367
This place.

67
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:31,339
Coco, get down before
you knock something over.

68
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,349
And what were you trying to say?

69
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,256
Honey, I'm pregnant.

70
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:47,825
By who?

71
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:54,530
So you sold your half
of the shop to Marty?

72
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,429
He's gotta be happy
about that, huh?

73
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:58,627
Yeah, he is. But I am too, you know?

74
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:01,869
I'm starting a new chapter
in my Iife, my man.

75
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,406
I'm Iaunching a magazine.

76
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:06,204
That's great. You took a risk,
and you made it happen.

77
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,937
You got Magic. I'm proud of you.

78
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,146
Whoa, hey!

79
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:13,081
Who said anything about Magic?

80
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:14,544
You don't have him?

81
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,051
Officially, no.

82
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,622
But it's Iooking good.
It's Iooking real good.

83
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,588
Matter of fact, it's Iooking so good...

84
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:25,823
...pour me a shot, pour yourself a shot
and then pour one for my man Magic.

85
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:27,363
Let me ask you something, Nick.

86
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:29,592
If you don't have him,
why'd you sell the shop?

87
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,331
I need the money, Jimmy.

88
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:34,799
It's been cool, but it's kind of hard
having Suzanne and the kids...

89
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:37,238
...just crammed up
into my small place.

90
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:39,467
It's just time to move on up, man.

91
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:42,078
PIus, I didn't tell you,
I'm having a baby.

92
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,113
AII right. My man's having a baby.

93
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:46,808
-Yeah. Yeah. That's right.
-Hey, baby.

94
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:49,454
-Hey, hey, hey.
-I thought I'd find you here. Hi, Jimmy.

95
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:52,785
-How'd it go?
-It went great.

96
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,586
Check it out.

97
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:57,860
Hey.

98
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:02,025
This baby got two heads.

99
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:06,433
And four arms and four Iegs.
Nick, we're having twins.

100
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,636
Twins?

101
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,310
-Honey.
-Cut off, Nick.

102
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:18,313
Thanks, Jimmy.

103
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:27,958
I can't believe you're making us
move to the country.

104
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,721
This is like child abuse
of the worst kind.

105
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:34,058
Where's the mall?

106
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:36,428
What you need a mall for?
That's your problem now.

107
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:39,435
You need to get a Iittle fresh air
and open spaces. Try that.

108
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:43,234
Lindsey, please. Okay?
Everybody, just relax.

109
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:45,400
Yeah, just relax.

110
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:47,538
Here, sweetie. Have a juice.

111
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:52,643
-Oh, God--
-Kevin!

112
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:56,886
What's that smell?

113
00:10:58,224 --> 00:10:59,885
Smells Iike oxygen.

114
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:02,357
Mom, please tell me you're joking.

115
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:04,689
-Enough.
-I hope it's the right place.

116
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:08,265
Of course it's not.
Our old house is the right house.

117
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:10,459
This is the place, guys. Come on.

118
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,071
Let's have a positive
mental attitude, okay?

119
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:24,071
Nice floors.

120
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,945
I smell cookies.

121
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:31,021
Kevin, Kevin, you cannot just walk
around these people's house Iike that.

122
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:37,123
Oh, this the culprit right here.

123
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:39,655
God!

124
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:44,860
Oh, baby. Oh, honey.
Okay, cold water. Go. Cold water.

125
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:49,941
Oh, goodness gracious!
What happened in here?

126
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:52,703
Did you touch the stove?
Was it the stove?

127
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:55,438
I'II tell you what, gonna put
Tunisian hemp root on there.

128
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:56,706
Make it as good as new.

129
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,481
It's true, actually.
I'm so sorry about that.

130
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:03,986
It's fine. He's just being a big baby.

131
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:06,318
Name's Chuck Mitchell Jr.

132
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:10,189
I'm the Iocal real-estate guy
here in Newburg County and....

133
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:12,387
You....

134
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,159
I know just exactly who you are.

135
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:16,833
You're Nick.

136
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:19,762
There we go.

137
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:22,339
Note to self, the hand still hurts.

138
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:27,178
-And the radiant....
-Suzanne.

139
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,908
Oh, my G-O-D.

140
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,818
Suzanne's with child.

141
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:38,881
You old dog, you!

142
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:41,492
-Oh, well--
-Hold up.

143
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:44,288
It's okay. I'm a part-time midwife.

144
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:45,794
I actually studied...

145
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:48,991
...at the Natural Childbirth Center
in Lucerne, Switzerland.

146
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:53,203
They're twins, aren't they?

147
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:57,206
Yes, they are.
How did you know that?

148
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:01,746
Would you Iike to know the sexes?

149
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:04,946
No.

150
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:08,644
Matter of fact, we wanna
keep it a surprise, Chuck.

151
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:11,415
Oh, fair enough. Isn't that
every parent's prerogative?

152
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:18,189
But if I were you, I wouldn't be in any
big hurry to paint the nursery pink.

153
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:22,861
Oh, gosh. It's just a special time,
being in that delivery room.

154
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:26,070
Right. The man almost fainted
when our guppy had babies.

155
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:29,332
Now, you know that
that was a hard delivery for me.

156
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:33,968
AII that cloudy water and then those
Iittle things popping out one by one.

157
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:37,573
Honey?

158
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,217
Babe.

159
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:41,114
Honey.

160
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:48,459
Now, the place was built in 1 889
by H. Van Hackett himself...

161
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:50,652
...Iegendary architect
and perfectionist.

162
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,821
I'd Iike to tell you something
right up front:

163
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:57,526
In all my years in "the business"--
And there have been more than a few.

164
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:01,067
--I have never seen
a more sound home.

165
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,164
Structurally speaking.

166
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:06,273
Wait till you get a Ioad
of the second floor.

167
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:07,810
Baby, do you see this?

168
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,914
-It's okay, we'II fix it.
-Did you see this?

169
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:14,415
Now, she's got five bedrooms
and four bathrooms...

170
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:18,455
...so needless to say, there's plenty
of room for the whole fam.

171
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:23,823
I think we're gonna go ahead and put
Mom and Dad in the master bedroom.

172
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:26,260
-Five bedrooms, right?
-Five, baby. You feeling me?

173
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:27,421
I'm feeling you.

174
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:30,394
-This big enough for you, baby?
-It's beautiful.

175
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:33,868
And, of course, the master bathroom.

176
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,600
Oh, my God, baby, a claw-foot tub.

177
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:40,438
-I've always wanted one of these.
-Me too.

178
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:42,080
Pretty awesome, right?

179
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:46,844
-I Iike it.
-It's beautiful. And the double sinks!

180
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:51,550
Oh, my God.
Baby, Iook at the shower.

181
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:55,725
Oh, my God, honey, this is bigger
than our entire apartment.

182
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,760
I know.

183
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:00,161
What's in there, Chuck?

184
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:03,631
That is a private toilet.

185
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,907
Baby.

186
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,475
-Did you say private?
-Yes, sir.

187
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:15,113
Oh, my God.

188
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,412
How I Iook?

189
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:19,083
How do you feel?

190
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,343
I feel good.

191
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,510
Feeling good's good enough.

192
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,293
You be okay in there, Nick?

193
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,556
Just give me one minute.

194
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:42,974
So, now, Suzanne here tells me
that you're in the publishing game?

195
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:46,134
Oh, yeah, I did sell a magazine
to OmniHouse.

196
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:47,301
An entrepreneur.

197
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:50,710
A budding William Randolph Hearst
right here in our midst.

198
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:54,114
I don't really know who that is,
Chuck, but, hey, I guess so.

199
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,186
Modest too? They broke the mold.

200
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:58,721
I'II tell you what, Suze,
I'd hang on to this one.

201
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:01,519
Oh, yeah, he's a keeper, Chuck.

202
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,525
Oh, way to stick the Ianding, Kev-o.

203
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:15,701
The Hacketts, of course,
used this as a guest cottage.

204
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:19,105
But with just a "scootcharino" of work,
it could be easily converted...

205
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:22,304
...into the perfect creative nook for,
you know, a....

206
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,306
A publisher.

207
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:29,079
You know, I was thinking about
writing in that bathroom up there.

208
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:30,243
Oh, yeah?

209
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,516
-Oh, honey, this is so charming.
-This'II work too.

210
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,853
Just for a second, Nick,
just for a second, imagine....

211
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,362
Imagine watching
a blue-throated hummingbird...

212
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:43,695
...suckle the nectar from a fresh
hydrangea blossom...

213
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:46,337
...while you free your mind...

214
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:50,134
...to the creative impulses that have
made every publishing empire great.

215
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:53,574
This is not a dress rehearsal, Nick.

216
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:58,046
Live the dream, baby,
Iive the dream.

217
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:02,446
Would you guys Iike
to see a tremendous view?

218
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:04,418
Would you? Come on. Come on.

219
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:07,889
-It's the coup de grâce. You'II Iove it.
-Come on, baby.

220
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:11,190
You're gonna wanna get Iow
coming through this door.

221
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:14,355
The roof-- Think you'II find the roof
needs a Iittle bit of work...

222
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,229
...so please be careful.

223
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:24,404
The property includes
an apple orchard.

224
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:28,410
There's some wild blackberries
over here, some cedars.

225
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:32,243
And I don't even wanna tell you
about the view of the Iake from here.

226
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:33,407
Breathe.

227
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:38,784
Breathe, breathe in that rich,
fresh air, Mr. Publisher.

228
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:40,822
How about it?

229
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:45,089
Oh, not so incidentally, they just built
a brand-new school down the road.

230
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:46,288
Really?

231
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:49,628
Newburg is a really amazing place
to raise a family.

232
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:51,929
Oh, it's just so beautiful, Chuck.

233
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:55,301
Well, you should see it
in the middle of the winter...

234
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:58,466
...with a blanket of snow covering it.
It's pretty as a postcard.

235
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,679
Personally, I Iike to power-walk
through these woods.

236
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:06,474
Never mind the fact that, of course,
I used to do the walk competitively.

237
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:07,846
Really?

238
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:12,457
Yeah, I was an alternate
to the '94 Goodwill Games in Russia.

239
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:19,687
Like I say, she is a fixer-upper...

240
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:22,993
...but I happen to know the finest
contractor in these parts.

241
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:25,693
You give that gentleman
a call and....

242
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:28,066
One way to make your Iife
a whole Iot easier.

243
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:30,273
So, now, where do
we stand there, Nickster?

244
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:32,905
I don't know, Chuck.

245
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:36,673
I'm not really sure if this is
the right place for us, you know.

246
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:39,545
It's a Iittle high-priced
and you're a Iittle weird.

247
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:44,947
Oh, gosh, I actually scheduled
a couple back-to-back with you guys.

248
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:49,686
Larry, Bernice. Hello! Come in.
PIease, make yourself at home.

249
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:52,292
-Okay, Chuck. Thanks.
-Thank you.

250
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:53,658
I gotta go.

251
00:18:58,637 --> 00:18:59,626
So, what you think?

252
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:03,297
I don't know. I don't know.
Can we really afford this house?

253
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:04,498
Of course.

254
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:07,543
Baby, with the advance,
plus the money we saved on rent...

255
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:10,147
...we can buy this place
two times over.

256
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,146
And have money to fix it up.

257
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:13,818
And guess what.

258
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,419
I can do the fixing.

259
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:18,647
I can barely get you to change
a Iight bulb at the apartment.

260
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,725
So what? Look, Iook.
Take a Iook at this.

261
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:23,486
-A house is Iike a painting.
-Yeah.

262
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:27,120
You can't really buy with your head,
you gotta buy with your heart.

263
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:30,332
Yeah, honey, but we have to think
with our heads right now.

264
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:31,867
We gotta think about the kids.

265
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:34,938
We gotta think about
it's the middle of the school year...

266
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:40,443
...Lindsey has her friends and she just
met that nice boy in her math class.

267
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:43,214
There's plenty of stuff
around here for Lindsey to do...

268
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:45,077
...that have nothing to do with boys.

269
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,717
And Kevin, this is perfect!

270
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,078
Look at the nature.
Look at the wilderness.

271
00:19:49,254 --> 00:19:51,188
We got a blueberry tree, baby.

272
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:54,848
Are we talking about the same kid?
Kevin doesn't go outside for recess.

273
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:58,758
That's why he needs a place Iike this,
to toughen him up.

274
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:00,831
PIus, I can take him fishing.

275
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:02,395
Who's going fishing?

276
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:04,502
-Me.
-You fish?

277
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:05,967
Oh, I can fish, baby.

278
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:08,106
Oh, when's the Iast time
you went fishing?

279
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,774
Last time-- Matter of fact,
it was before I met you...

280
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:13,241
...Iast time I went fishing.

281
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:14,572
And....

282
00:20:14,846 --> 00:20:17,076
I don't know how to fish,
but I can Iearn.

283
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:19,709
And then I could teach him,
and we can bond.

284
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,853
-"We can bond."
-We'II become a true family.

285
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,488
-"A true family."
-Picture it.

286
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:26,653
What you think?

287
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:32,590
I think there are a Iot
of rooms in this house...

288
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:35,959
...that are gonna need breaking in.

289
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:39,297
Oh, yeah?
Well, what about the roof?

290
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:42,304
The roof isn't a bad place to start.

291
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:45,307
Well, come over here,
drop it Iike it's hot, girl.

292
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:47,301
Baby!

293
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:53,916
We'II take it.

294
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:12,131
Good boy.

295
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:14,865
Good boy.

296
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:20,676
-Where'd she go?
-She was just.... I don't know.

297
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:23,576
There.

298
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:27,417
What you doing?

299
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:47,163
Stop! Coco, stop!

300
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:51,361
Help!

301
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,978
Hey, honey, do you know
how this garbage disposal works?

302
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:11,782
Because I've tried every single one
of these switches.

303
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,218
What about this one?

304
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:18,958
See? Everything is working out
just Iike I promised, huh?

305
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:24,261
I can fix that.

306
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:26,629
Oh, you can fix that?

307
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:32,009
Hey, I hope we're not disturbing you.
I'm Mr. Rooney, this is Mrs. Rooney.

308
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:35,374
Oh, so formal.
PIease, call me Mrs. Rooney.

309
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:37,738
We wanted to be the first
to welcome you.

310
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,577
Oh, we sure did.

311
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,582
We are the first, aren't we?

312
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:43,042
You're the first.

313
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:44,479
Yes.

314
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:46,954
-That Iooks gross.
-Kevin.

315
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:49,423
That fish put this town on the map.

316
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:53,394
Oh, yeah. Sturgeon tastes
a Iot Iike chicken, only fishy.

317
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,361
-Nice.
-I think you're gonna enjoy it.

318
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:57,434
And even if you don't, it's dead.

319
00:23:58,136 --> 00:24:00,263
Did you wanna come inside
for something to drink?

320
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:02,539
Oh, that's so sweet.

321
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:05,870
But we don't really drink so early
in the day around these parts, but--

322
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:11,539
-Right. No.
-No, no, I meant, Iike, just a Iemonade.

323
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:20,949
Boy, get them fish.

324
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:24,052
Thank you. CIose the door.

325
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:26,690
-Welcome.
-For you.

326
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:28,992
Tastes Iike chicken.

327
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:35,773
Sturgeon, right?
Give me the fish, man.

328
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:38,569
Y'all get out of here
before I call the cops.

329
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:45,014
Hey, Nick.
I can't find Coco anywhere.

330
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:46,445
Give me that.

331
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:49,051
Don't worry about Coco,
he'II show up sooner or Iater.

332
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:51,815
There's a Iot of trees
to pee on out there.

333
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:56,694
What you want me to do?

334
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:00,722
Coco!

335
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:03,960
Where's that dog?

336
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:07,730
Maybe we should go back.
It's kind of scary out here.

337
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:09,965
Scary? Boy, it's beautiful out here.

338
00:25:10,141 --> 00:25:13,508
Look, you with the man. I was the man
in the city, and I'm the man out here.

339
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:16,704
Trust me, when you're with me,
there's nothing to be scared of.

340
00:25:19,417 --> 00:25:20,679
But that.

341
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:26,083
Run! Go! Go!

342
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:28,523
Can you hear me now?

343
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:31,355
Hello? Can you hear me now?

344
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:34,499
Off the phone, please. Here we are.

345
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:37,059
Oh, Iook at this.

346
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:39,770
-That's nice.
-Yeah.

347
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:42,429
And Iook at us.
One big, happy family.

348
00:25:42,607 --> 00:25:45,075
Yes, one big, happy family.

349
00:25:45,644 --> 00:25:47,771
Lindsey, would you Iike
to give thanks?

350
00:25:48,346 --> 00:25:49,813
Why, are we going home?

351
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:51,710
This is our home.

352
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:52,906
Our real home, Mom.

353
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:56,281
Where my friends are.
Where I can get cell phone reception.

354
00:25:56,454 --> 00:25:58,820
Lindsey,
put away the phone, please.

355
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:00,786
Kevin?

356
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:03,357
-I don't Iike this fish.
-Me neither.

357
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:06,859
But we're gonna be eating this
every day for the next six months...

358
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,498
...so get used to it.

359
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:11,898
Now, Lindsey. Grace.

360
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:15,801
Dear Lord, thank you for all the
blessings that you gave us.

361
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:18,173
Before they were taken away.

362
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:21,808
Like my friends,
cell phone reception--

363
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,242
Time-out, I got this.

364
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:24,915
PIease, honey.

365
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,984
Oh, patient and heavenly Father...

366
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:31,814
...who's probably 1 0 times
more patient and heavenly...

367
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:34,220
...than any stepfather
should have to be--

368
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:35,415
Baby.

369
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:36,891
--we give thanks.

370
00:26:37,629 --> 00:26:39,062
I know at times it seems Iike...

371
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:41,960
...we're nothing but a bunch of
back-talking sass mouths...

372
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:45,864
...who don't know when we got it good
in a nice, beautiful home.

373
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:52,266
At Ieast the table's strong.

374
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,606
I can fix that.

375
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:01,781
Honey, I think you should
just call the contractor.

376
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:06,049
Suzanne, the electrical parts
alone is a 30 percent markup.

377
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:08,158
And a contractor?

378
00:27:08,326 --> 00:27:10,794
You're talking about
1 25 bucks a hour.

379
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:22,295
Now do you want the number?

380
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,873
Contractor's here!

381
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:38,886
Coco! Oh, Coco.

382
00:27:39,257 --> 00:27:40,815
Coco, sit.

383
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:53,002
How did you do that?

384
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:55,571
That's German.
It's the Ianguage of discipline.

385
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:58,436
I was fortunate a couple of years back
to spend some time...

386
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:01,101
...and study with the friars
of New Skete.

387
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,940
Nick!

388
00:28:03,114 --> 00:28:05,378
I found Coco by the highway,
but it's no problem...

389
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:09,042
-...because he had his tags on.
-Chuck, what you doing here?

390
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:12,883
I got a message down at the office
that you were Iooking for a contractor?

391
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:15,860
But you're the Iocal real-estate guy.

392
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:17,961
Yes, I am.

393
00:28:18,163 --> 00:28:20,495
And I'm also the Iocal contractor.

394
00:28:20,665 --> 00:28:21,962
Do you Iove it?

395
00:28:27,272 --> 00:28:30,207
-What's that smell?
-Fifty pounds of fish.

396
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,343
Do you know the power
went out Iast night?

397
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:33,875
On it.

398
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:37,840
What you mean, "ruh-roh"?

399
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:42,009
Nick, when exactly
did you buy this home?

400
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,653
Are you serious?

401
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:45,687
You know exactly
when I bought this dump...

402
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:47,552
...because you the one sold it to us.

403
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,058
And that's what makes it
so very unpleasant for me...

404
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:53,254
...to have to tell you that your home's
electrical system is shot.

405
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:56,394
AII right, all right, all right.
FIag on the play.

406
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:59,298
Why didn't you tell us this
when you showed us the house?

407
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:03,701
Nick, in all fairness,
I did have my Realtor's cap on.

408
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:07,106
You know, might remember
that great blue blazer and the khakis.

409
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:09,644
My contractor's hat was safely
at home in the closet.

410
00:29:09,814 --> 00:29:11,941
They're two distinctly
different chapeaus...

411
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:15,347
...but they should have told you
when you had the place inspected.

412
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,051
How's it going, guys?

413
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:19,190
Nick didn't have
this dump inspected.

414
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:22,349
I had it inspected. It was inspected.

415
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:29,194
It was just inspected by me.

416
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:31,426
Honey, how could you not
hire an inspector?

417
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:34,128
We talked about this.
How could you be so irresponsible?

418
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:35,932
I trusted you on this.

419
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:39,372
-Don't blame me, it's his fault.
-Well, how is it Chuck's fault?

420
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:40,533
He Iied!

421
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:43,772
No, he didn't. You was just too cheap
to hire an inspector.

422
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,279
That's besides the point.

423
00:29:47,051 --> 00:29:48,643
They're kicking, aren't they?

424
00:29:48,853 --> 00:29:50,582
Feels Iike they're playing soccer.

425
00:29:50,755 --> 00:29:52,245
You okay?

426
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:58,528
They say that the move
was very traumatic for them...

427
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:01,392
...and that you shouldn't sleep
on your right side.

428
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:02,965
How do you know, Chuck?

429
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:05,034
I'm a baby whisperer.

430
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:06,534
A baby what?

431
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:12,842
AIso, they'd Iove it if you could Iay off
the Indian food. Curry is a no-no.

432
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:14,706
Oh, brother.

433
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:18,144
Unfortunately, you gotta upgrade
the main panel and pull all the wires.

434
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:19,840
That just sound Iike a bigger job.

435
00:30:20,018 --> 00:30:21,713
Oh, crap.

436
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:27,691
You got raccoons.

437
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:31,829
Oh, yeah. Raccoons
that Iike Corn Nuts.

438
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:36,600
Word to the wise, careful with those
raccoons. They're vicious.

439
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:37,992
Hey, hey, Chuck.

440
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:40,504
When it comes
to this electrical stuff....

441
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:43,706
How much this gonna cost me?

442
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:45,740
Oh, gosh, I don't know.
A home this size...

443
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:47,878
...you're Iooking at 8, 9.

444
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:49,877
-Hundred?
-Thousand.

445
00:30:50,448 --> 00:30:51,881
Get off my property.

446
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:56,213
I might fixed.

447
00:30:56,387 --> 00:30:58,252
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

448
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:01,791
Perfect.
That's what I'm talking about.

449
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,222
I'm professional.

450
00:31:03,394 --> 00:31:05,487
Thanks. Appreciate it, Serge.

451
00:31:05,663 --> 00:31:07,392
Come again.

452
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:15,395
Did you see that? Look and Iearn,
Iittle girl. 1 50 bucks. Painless.

453
00:31:15,573 --> 00:31:17,302
Are you sure it's safe?

454
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:19,272
Of course it's safe.

455
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:20,706
He said all we gotta do...

456
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:24,246
...is not use the microwave
and the toaster at the same time.

457
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:28,044
That's just common sense.

458
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:33,423
Eight thousand dollars.

459
00:31:33,591 --> 00:31:36,151
I knew that dude Chuck
was a crook the minute I met him.

460
00:31:36,327 --> 00:31:38,727
Oh, honey, I think
you're a Iittle bit stressed out...

461
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:42,162
...with the move and everything and,
you know...

462
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:45,200
...there's one thing
that we haven't been able to do...

463
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:46,997
...in this big old drafty mansion.

464
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:49,665
Insulation. That'II be perfect.

465
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:53,038
If we do that, we'II save
a Iot of money on heating bills.

466
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:56,544
Baby, I was actually thinking of
something else we could do...

467
00:31:56,714 --> 00:31:59,046
...to stay nice and warm.

468
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:01,545
Oh, I know what you're thinking.

469
00:32:04,188 --> 00:32:05,519
Honey, what was that?

470
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:07,123
The raccoon.

471
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:08,953
-He's on the roof?
-Yeah.

472
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:10,822
You gotta show him who's boss.

473
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:13,793
If you don't do that,
you'II never get rid of him.

474
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:16,864
Baby, but Chuck says they're vicious.

475
00:32:17,035 --> 00:32:18,593
Yeah, if you're a baby whisperer.

476
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:22,802
But me, I'm the man.

477
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:25,435
You are the man.

478
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,874
-You got my back?
-I got your back.

479
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:29,479
Watch this.

480
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:45,158
Is that my Corn Nuts?

481
00:32:46,397 --> 00:32:48,592
You should know
not to mess with a man's nuts.

482
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:50,893
Be prepared
to pay the ultimate price.

483
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:53,401
Honey. Honey, what are you
doing out there?

484
00:32:53,571 --> 00:32:54,799
Step back, baby.

485
00:32:55,773 --> 00:32:56,762
What you wanna do?

486
00:32:57,775 --> 00:32:59,174
Look, he ain't even running.

487
00:32:59,577 --> 00:33:01,704
He think he bad. You think you bad?

488
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:06,341
I've dealt with rats in the city
bigger than you, boy.

489
00:33:08,052 --> 00:33:10,919
Kids, go to bed. I got this.

490
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:15,088
-Baby!
-I got him!

491
00:33:21,966 --> 00:33:23,058
Did I get him?

492
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:26,735
-No.
-No.

493
00:33:29,073 --> 00:33:30,836
Sucker.

494
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:56,899
Nicholas J. Persons?

495
00:33:57,335 --> 00:34:01,066
-Chuck?
-Charles Mitchell. City inspector.

496
00:34:02,507 --> 00:34:04,600
We got a problem. Let's go.

497
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:07,240
What's with the badge, Chuck?

498
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:11,041
Look, I don't have time for
none of this, okay? So make it quick.

499
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:15,276
Sir, you can't just go around tapping
into other people's power supplies.

500
00:34:15,453 --> 00:34:17,444
It's dangerous, it's against the Iaw...

501
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:20,455
...and quite frankly, Mr. Persons,
it's rude.

502
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:22,584
What are you talking about?

503
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,125
I'm gonna go ahead and guess...

504
00:34:24,295 --> 00:34:27,264
...that that work wasn't done
by a Iicensed contractor.

505
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:30,230
You know, I didn't even know
they was gonna Ieave it Iike that.

506
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:33,632
You went ahead and availed yourself
to the cheap, unskilled Iabor pool...

507
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:35,932
...that congregates outside
the hardware store?

508
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:40,238
I know. Tell you what I'm gonna do.

509
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,675
For reference, I'm gonna
provide you with a Iist...

510
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:45,008
...of all the Iicensed,
bonded contractors...

511
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:47,845
...we have here in the Iocal vicinity.

512
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:54,191
I am also going to fine you $1 000
for breaking the Iaw.

513
00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:56,451
What? A thousand bucks?

514
00:34:56,627 --> 00:34:58,151
If you knew what you were doing...

515
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:01,526
...you'd be facing jail time,
so consider yourself Iucky.

516
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,797
We're shutting your power down
till further notice.

517
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:09,469
What am I supposed to do?
Build a windmill?

518
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:13,303
Well, that's not a bad idea, so Iong as
you contact the city zoning officer first.

519
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:15,469
Quality guy.
Would you Iike his card?

520
00:35:15,646 --> 00:35:16,806
-No.
-I'm out of here.

521
00:35:16,981 --> 00:35:20,439
Hey, wait a minute, Chuck.
Chuck, come on, man. It's me. Nick.

522
00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:23,811
Help me get my power back on.

523
00:35:23,988 --> 00:35:25,956
I'm the city inspector, Mr. Persons.

524
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,217
Restoring power's
a Iittle beyond my purview.

525
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:33,888
Okay, I know what this is. And I seen
this one before. What's it gonna take?

526
00:35:34,065 --> 00:35:37,796
You realize if I accepted that,
I'd have to arrest myself on the spot...

527
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,334
...and I'm not that guy.

528
00:35:40,037 --> 00:35:41,368
But you're a contractor.

529
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:44,201
But I'm not wearing
that hat right now.

530
00:35:46,844 --> 00:35:48,471
Well, you can put it on.

531
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:54,474
It's your Iucky day.
It happens to be in the car.

532
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:02,482
Oh, God. Oh, what,
they shut you down?

533
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:06,221
The heartless bureaucrats.
They're the worst.

534
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:08,755
Can you help me?

535
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:11,834
Well, restoring power's
not as easy as it sounds.

536
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,766
It just might take a couple days.

537
00:36:13,938 --> 00:36:17,374
A couple of days?
Man, I'm trying to Iaunch a magazine.

538
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:20,170
AII right? What am I supposed to do
without a computer?

539
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:22,169
We're gonna get your power
back on.

540
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:24,481
It's not even gonna be an issue.

541
00:36:24,649 --> 00:36:26,173
Trust me.

542
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:34,387
Here you go, honey.

543
00:36:35,593 --> 00:36:37,060
Your sandwich.

544
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,588
-What?
-Okay.

545
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:44,066
-Hey, Suzanne.
-Hey, Chuck. Come on in.

546
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:45,930
What smells good?
Are those sandwiches?

547
00:36:46,103 --> 00:36:48,230
Oh, yeah, sturgeon salad.
Would you Iike one?

548
00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:51,432
-I hate to impose.
-Oh, no, Chuck, anything for you.

549
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:54,578
Hey, hey, hey, man. What's with
all the racket? I'm trying to work.

550
00:36:54,745 --> 00:36:57,771
We had to saw off the breaker box.
I'd Iike some mustard on there.

551
00:36:57,949 --> 00:36:59,109
I'm a big mustard guy.

552
00:36:59,283 --> 00:37:02,650
But you should be good now.
We'II have you up and running in a jiff.

553
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:08,417
That's Magic Johnson. That's my guy.
That's my main man.

554
00:37:08,593 --> 00:37:10,891
Did I tell you
I was on the '86 Lakers?

555
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:13,326
-No.
-Yes, indeedy, sweetie.

556
00:37:13,664 --> 00:37:16,258
I had 38 seconds of playing time.

557
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:18,766
It was game two of the final
and "Big Game" James...

558
00:37:18,936 --> 00:37:22,838
...went down with a bad wheel,
so we're up by 20 and they put me in.

559
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:24,440
Check it out, Nicker.

560
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:26,702
Get ahold of the purple and gold.

561
00:37:29,513 --> 00:37:31,242
That's commitment, right?

562
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:34,851
When you do talk to the Magic Man,
tell him Chuck-dog said:

563
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:37,078
"Holler. That's what's up."

564
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:39,923
-"Holler."
-Thank you so much.

565
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:43,925
Anyway, the good news is we're
getting the power up and running.

566
00:37:47,331 --> 00:37:50,164
The bad news is you got dry rot.

567
00:37:50,334 --> 00:37:52,131
Dry what?

568
00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:55,136
Can I tell you something?
This is the most incredible sandwich.

569
00:37:55,306 --> 00:37:57,331
You know your way
around a sturgeon.

570
00:37:57,508 --> 00:38:00,272
Wait, wait, wait a minute.
Back to the dry rot.

571
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:01,433
How big is this?

572
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:05,139
Well, it could be considerable,
but y'all don't worry about a thing.

573
00:38:05,316 --> 00:38:07,682
I know the best dry-rot guys
in Newburg County.

574
00:38:09,253 --> 00:38:10,880
How's the guy situation out there?

575
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,883
Nothing at all.
No cuties, no nothing.

576
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:17,027
Girl, I feel sorry for you.

577
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,459
-I didn't wanna move here.
-I don't blame you.

578
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,461
Push. Push.

579
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:38,678
You should try
and get back here somehow.

580
00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:40,680
At least there are boys here.

581
00:38:40,851 --> 00:38:43,684
Are you still there? Linds? Hello?

582
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:46,550
Hello? Are you there?

583
00:38:46,724 --> 00:38:49,124
Yeah. I gotta go.

584
00:38:54,231 --> 00:38:56,893
Yup. You got the rot, brah.

585
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:02,665
-How you know?
-Nick.

586
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,034
-What?
-He's not aware.

587
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:09,111
Nick, the Pulu family has been in the
dry-rot business for three generations.

588
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,805
Hawaiians know the dry rot
better than the rest of us...

589
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:13,847
...because the island is so darn wet.

590
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:16,509
Well, then why do they call it dry rot?

591
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:19,121
That's a misnomer. Listen carefully.

592
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:22,851
Billy and George here,
they're highly skilled craftsmen...

593
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:27,589
...very much in demand,
but Danny, gosh, he's got a gift.

594
00:39:27,765 --> 00:39:33,567
He's an artist, and if he says you've
got the rot, you've got the rot, brah.

595
00:39:33,738 --> 00:39:39,973
Okay, say I got "the rot," brah.
I mean, can't we Iive with it?

596
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:43,272
Can you Iive with a wood-rotting
fungi that colonizes and spreads...

597
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:46,075
...to every timber in your home,
Ieading to a mold...

598
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:48,377
...which can produce
airborne pathogens...

599
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:50,816
...that might infect every member
of your family...

600
00:39:50,988 --> 00:39:53,786
...causing conjunctivitis,
hypersensitivity pneumonitis...

601
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:55,789
...and I'm not gonna Iie to you here...

602
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,861
...allergic bronchopulmonary
aspergillosis.

603
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:00,887
Oh, yeah. No problem.

604
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,828
No.

605
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,991
I think they should fix it now.

606
00:40:05,803 --> 00:40:09,466
You know, that is, because we don't
want it to spread and kill us all, right?

607
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,801
Don't you got clothes
to go put on or something?

608
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:13,568
-Ma.
-Go.

609
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:19,306
Right here, right here.

610
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:21,713
AII right, how much
is it gonna cost me?

611
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:24,086
-Tough to predict.
-It's Iike that.

612
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:28,586
Do what you gotta do, all right?
Do what you gotta do.

613
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,192
But you gotta put on these...

614
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:33,797
...because you're kind of fat and
I don't want you scuffing up my floors.

615
00:40:33,964 --> 00:40:35,363
Don't be a hick, Nick.

616
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:37,824
These guys are professionals.

617
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,661
Nice bootie.

618
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:44,439
-Talking about this.
-Give it up.

619
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:49,445
Yes, ma'am. I understand you guys
need all the questions.

620
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:51,638
I have them right here
in front of me...

621
00:40:51,816 --> 00:40:55,183
...but I'm in the process of
relocating offices....

622
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:57,320
Maybe I can fax them
to you Iater on today?

623
00:40:57,488 --> 00:40:59,718
Or tomorrow, the next day,
or the day after that.

624
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:03,519
-As long as we make our deadline.
-Okay, thanks. Tell Magic I said hey.

625
00:41:03,694 --> 00:41:04,683
-Will do.
-AII right.

626
00:41:04,862 --> 00:41:06,625
-Goodbye.
-Bye-bye.

627
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:11,495
Peek-a-brah.

628
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:13,125
What up, man?

629
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:15,704
Sorry to interrupt, Mr. P.
We just need you to Iook...

630
00:41:15,873 --> 00:41:18,034
...sign off on phase one
of the dry-rot repair.

631
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:20,302
Oh, okay. No problem.

632
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:22,241
Nice. Georgie, go Iong!

633
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:26,281
No, no, no. Georgie,
you don't have to go Iong.

634
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:28,884
I'II just meet y'all out front.

635
00:41:29,053 --> 00:41:31,180
So how many phases is it?

636
00:41:31,355 --> 00:41:33,016
Just two.

637
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:35,719
So you guys are halfway through.

638
00:41:35,893 --> 00:41:38,521
Oh, man, that's painless.

639
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,577
What is this?

640
00:41:57,748 --> 00:41:59,409
Phase one.

641
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:00,811
Phase one?

642
00:42:00,985 --> 00:42:02,077
Hey, Nickeroo.

643
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:04,886
You.

644
00:42:05,055 --> 00:42:06,079
Where you been, man?

645
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:08,623
Suzanne was feeling tired,
so I picked up Kev-o...

646
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:09,816
...and shot some hoop.

647
00:42:09,994 --> 00:42:11,393
What is wrong with you?

648
00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:14,463
Man, you know this boy got asthma.
He can't shoot no hoops.

649
00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:18,762
He cured it, just Iike that.
With something called the go...?

650
00:42:19,303 --> 00:42:20,429
Goji berries.

651
00:42:20,604 --> 00:42:22,834
-Listen.
-Check it out.

652
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:26,398
Inhale Iove.

653
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,804
Exhale inclusion.

654
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:33,746
It's a Iittle trick I picked up during a
fast with His Holiness in Dharamsala.

655
00:42:33,918 --> 00:42:35,476
And finish.

656
00:42:35,653 --> 00:42:38,486
Yeah, well, His Holiness
doesn't have to deal with his mother.

657
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:40,388
You keep your inhaler.

658
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:41,786
It was no bother.

659
00:42:41,959 --> 00:42:43,859
We had to stop
at Fred's hardware store...

660
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:46,895
...to pick up a new tankless
water heater. Your old one's shot.

661
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:51,125
Oh, so now you going out and buying
things without even asking me first.

662
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:55,995
I don't know what to tell you.
It's a tankless job.

663
00:42:57,107 --> 00:42:59,439
-I did not--
-Yes, he did.

664
00:43:01,045 --> 00:43:03,946
-Good one, Chuck.
-Good one, Chuck.

665
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:09,986
Oh, what a great kid. Holy moly,
does he have a terrific jump shot.

666
00:43:10,154 --> 00:43:12,452
Honest to goodness,
if he grows another six feet...

667
00:43:12,623 --> 00:43:13,988
...he's gonna be unstoppable.

668
00:43:14,158 --> 00:43:16,092
Hey, Nick. Look what Chuck got me.

669
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,818
-Isn't it awesome?
-Oh, yeah.

670
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:23,895
-Wait. Give me that.
-Fire! Fire! Fire!

671
00:43:24,068 --> 00:43:25,092
Give me this.

672
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:27,260
What'd be awesome
is if you was here...

673
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,838
...to keep these Iinebackers
from tearing up my house.

674
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:31,668
Dry rot is a tricky thing.

675
00:43:31,842 --> 00:43:34,868
You never really know
how much damage there is....

676
00:43:35,045 --> 00:43:36,876
Till you get into it.

677
00:43:37,047 --> 00:43:41,040
It's Iike I always say, it's gonna get
ugly before it gets pretty.

678
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:44,119
Let me tell you something.
We're gonna get your walls back up...

679
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:46,620
...and your home
is gonna be stronger for it.

680
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:50,556
It better be. If not, I'm holding you
personally responsible.

681
00:43:50,728 --> 00:43:53,822
So I want you to be the one
to keep your eye on this whole project.

682
00:43:53,998 --> 00:43:56,523
A very close eye.
Do you understand me?

683
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,497
CIose eyes.

684
00:43:58,669 --> 00:44:01,934
I hear you Ioud and clear...

685
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,798
...Nickeroo.

686
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:07,170
With the gun. What are you doing?

687
00:44:07,578 --> 00:44:09,637
And put on some booties.

688
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:17,077
It's Sunday morning, Nick. Isn't it so
nice to have the house to ourselves?

689
00:44:17,254 --> 00:44:18,744
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

690
00:44:23,727 --> 00:44:27,185
What? What is this?

691
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,803
Hey, hey, hey.

692
00:44:33,971 --> 00:44:35,905
-What's up, Nick?
-What you doing?

693
00:44:36,073 --> 00:44:38,007
You said keep a close eye
on the project.

694
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:40,439
So you going camping?

695
00:44:40,611 --> 00:44:43,910
That's crazy talk. I'm moving in.

696
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:47,749
Chuck, what about your wife?
Doesn't she want you home?

697
00:44:47,918 --> 00:44:49,977
I don't even want him home.
I know she don't.

698
00:44:50,154 --> 00:44:54,250
Don't worry about the missus. EIIie's
on tour over in China for three months.

699
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:57,386
Three months?

700
00:44:57,561 --> 00:44:59,756
Yeah. She's a country singer.

701
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:03,229
You wouldn't believe the way
the Chinese Iove their country music.

702
00:45:03,634 --> 00:45:05,397
But this ain't gonna take
three months.

703
00:45:05,569 --> 00:45:08,094
You're right. Could take Ionger.

704
00:45:08,405 --> 00:45:11,966
But don't worry about me.
You won't even know I'm here.

705
00:45:13,977 --> 00:45:17,174
What do you say? Let's get
out there before the sun gets too hot.

706
00:45:18,182 --> 00:45:20,412
-Get out where?
-Chuck's taking us fishing.

707
00:45:20,584 --> 00:45:22,779
The sturgeon are running.
It's gonna be fantastic.

708
00:45:22,953 --> 00:45:25,649
-You wanna come?
-Oh, Chuck, that is a great idea.

709
00:45:25,823 --> 00:45:27,984
No, no, I can't go fishing.
That's a bad idea.

710
00:45:28,158 --> 00:45:30,592
-Why?
-I got too much work to do.

711
00:45:30,761 --> 00:45:34,026
I gotta set traps in case
that raccoon comes back.

712
00:45:34,198 --> 00:45:36,462
You know those are
vicious animals, baby.

713
00:45:36,633 --> 00:45:38,931
Oh, come on, Nick.
The water's not that deep.

714
00:45:39,436 --> 00:45:40,494
I don't care about that.

715
00:45:40,671 --> 00:45:43,071
Wait a minute, Nick,
are you afraid of the water?

716
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,731
-Honey.
-No. That's ridiculous.

717
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:49,401
By "no" he means yes, and by
"ridiculous" he means terrified.

718
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:53,414
And he did promise
that he'd teach Kevin how to fish.

719
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:57,213
Okay. AII right. Fine.
I'II go fishing.

720
00:45:57,387 --> 00:45:59,014
Fine.

721
00:45:59,189 --> 00:46:00,554
-Yes!
-Thanks, Chuck.

722
00:46:00,724 --> 00:46:01,850
-Yes!
-Don't mention it.

723
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:12,600
I hate this. I'm gonna Iet y'all
know right now, I hate this.

724
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:15,637
-Come on.
-You know what? I--

725
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:19,507
I think I just swallowed a bug.

726
00:46:29,486 --> 00:46:30,475
Y'all see that?

727
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:32,645
Stop messing around, Nick.
Come on.

728
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:36,855
For real, I think we need a bigger boat.
I'm not playing.

729
00:46:37,027 --> 00:46:39,325
No, come on. Just take your rod...

730
00:46:40,531 --> 00:46:41,520
...and cast away.

731
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:44,293
Don't tell me nothing
about fishing, okay?

732
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:47,596
I was the king of Go Fish
in my neighborhood.

733
00:46:47,771 --> 00:46:49,739
This shouldn't be hard, just--

734
00:47:08,458 --> 00:47:10,050
I saw a shark down there.

735
00:47:10,227 --> 00:47:13,526
Oh, Nick, nice barrel roll.
Just real nice.

736
00:47:13,697 --> 00:47:16,461
That's it. I'm gone. I'm gone.

737
00:47:25,943 --> 00:47:27,604
-Hey, Nick?
-What?

738
00:47:27,778 --> 00:47:28,870
I'd be careful.

739
00:47:29,046 --> 00:47:32,982
Don't worry about me,
I'm on Iand now. I got this.

740
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:38,577
Help!

741
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:42,722
Help. Somebody.

742
00:47:47,965 --> 00:47:49,455
I gotta fire Chuck.

743
00:47:49,633 --> 00:47:51,464
Why, because he made you
go fishing?

744
00:47:51,768 --> 00:47:54,168
No, because he's tearing up
our house.

745
00:47:54,338 --> 00:47:57,739
Well, it's gonna get ugly
before it gets pretty, Nick.

746
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:01,845
Don't you start quoting him
Iike he's some kind of oracle...

747
00:48:02,012 --> 00:48:04,003
...because he's not. He's an idiot.

748
00:48:04,181 --> 00:48:06,240
He's sweet.

749
00:48:08,652 --> 00:48:10,210
What?

750
00:48:10,821 --> 00:48:11,981
Nothing.

751
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:17,660
Oh, Nick, I know, I know.
This has been so hard for everybody...

752
00:48:17,828 --> 00:48:20,729
...with this house,
and you're used to being a bachelor...

753
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:25,062
...and now you've got me and the kids
and the responsibilities of this house.

754
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:27,703
I know you're under
a Iot of pressure, honey.

755
00:48:28,772 --> 00:48:31,332
Oh, my goodness.
Come here. Feel this.

756
00:48:31,508 --> 00:48:33,601
Touch it, right here.

757
00:48:33,777 --> 00:48:34,937
Do you feel him?

758
00:48:37,681 --> 00:48:38,773
What is that, his butt?

759
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:40,246
I think so.

760
00:48:40,717 --> 00:48:42,981
Isn't that the coolest thing?

761
00:48:44,621 --> 00:48:46,145
Did you hear that?

762
00:48:46,323 --> 00:48:47,517
-Boy.
-Did you hear that?

763
00:48:47,691 --> 00:48:50,182
-Honey, is that the raccoon?
-No.

764
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:54,854
Raccoon made a scuffling sound.
That was more Iike a rustle.

765
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:02,138
I think it's in the chimney.

766
00:49:17,688 --> 00:49:19,315
I guess I showed him.

767
00:49:19,489 --> 00:49:20,717
Yeah.

768
00:49:21,425 --> 00:49:23,552
-Yeah.
-Yeah, baby.

769
00:49:23,727 --> 00:49:27,390
That's right. You might
wanna close that flue, though.

770
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:39,873
Leave me alone, man. Get back.

771
00:50:02,933 --> 00:50:05,163
Looks Iike we better put a cap
on that chimney.

772
00:50:05,769 --> 00:50:07,964
These guys will drive you batty.

773
00:50:09,206 --> 00:50:10,673
Night, neighbor.

774
00:50:11,141 --> 00:50:12,472
I'm sick of you.

775
00:50:21,551 --> 00:50:23,018
Chuck!

776
00:50:30,994 --> 00:50:31,983
What?

777
00:50:34,464 --> 00:50:36,193
-Hey, Chuck.
-Yeah?

778
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:37,890
What's going on
with my glass door?

779
00:50:38,068 --> 00:50:40,127
Frame rotted. Ripped it out,
ordered a new one.

780
00:50:40,303 --> 00:50:43,101
Triple-pane xenon-filled.
Pricey, yes...

781
00:50:43,273 --> 00:50:46,709
...but it'II probably pay for itself
in 1 5, 20 years max.

782
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:49,038
What's going on?
I need the water back.

783
00:50:49,946 --> 00:50:52,676
I'm guessing you didn't get
the memo.

784
00:50:52,849 --> 00:50:57,548
I posted it on the fridge Iate
Iast night. "Water off, 8 a.m. sharp."

785
00:50:57,721 --> 00:51:02,055
And I don't want you to spiral into
a worry tizzy about the H2O.

786
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:04,489
It turns out your water
is pure as driven snow.

787
00:51:04,661 --> 00:51:07,630
It's the pipes that are the problem.
They're completely corroded.

788
00:51:07,798 --> 00:51:08,787
You wanna show him?

789
00:51:10,267 --> 00:51:13,236
I pulled this disgusting piece of pipe
from under your house.

790
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:15,132
Can you see through that?

791
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:17,837
Yeah, I didn't think so.

792
00:51:18,008 --> 00:51:20,203
If that was your artery,
you'd be dead by now.

793
00:51:20,377 --> 00:51:23,346
Or one side of your body would be,
Iike, totally paralyzed.

794
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:27,980
Show him just exactly what
you plan to replace it with.

795
00:51:30,353 --> 00:51:31,752
This is 1 -inch copper piping.

796
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:34,982
I'm gonna use this for the verticals,
half-inch for the horizontals.

797
00:51:35,158 --> 00:51:38,321
Your water pressure's gonna be
hovering at around 1 50 psi...

798
00:51:38,495 --> 00:51:39,655
...give or take a psi.

799
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:41,321
Is that good?

800
00:51:43,967 --> 00:51:45,867
That is insane.

801
00:51:46,169 --> 00:51:49,138
Insane, huh?
Insane sounds expensive.

802
00:51:55,045 --> 00:51:56,637
Hey, Chuck, I Iike this guy.

803
00:51:56,813 --> 00:51:59,179
-He's the best. The best.
-He's funny.

804
00:51:59,349 --> 00:52:03,251
AII right, fellas,
Iet's go Iay some pipe.

805
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:12,425
Come on, fellas, this way.
Through the bedroom.

806
00:52:14,197 --> 00:52:16,597
So Chuck thinks we should try
the Bradley Method.

807
00:52:17,734 --> 00:52:19,429
What's the Bradley Method?

808
00:52:19,603 --> 00:52:21,730
It's natural childbirth.

809
00:52:21,905 --> 00:52:23,497
You know what else
he was telling me?

810
00:52:23,673 --> 00:52:25,834
We should actually consider
a home birth.

811
00:52:26,843 --> 00:52:30,210
Home birth? With doctors coming
all in the house and stuff?

812
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:32,041
-Yeah.
-I'm not sure.

813
00:52:32,215 --> 00:52:35,412
Okay. Well, you know,
we could always have a midwife.

814
00:52:35,685 --> 00:52:37,482
You mean Chuck?

815
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:39,053
He studied in Switzerland.

816
00:52:39,222 --> 00:52:41,247
-So?
-What do you mean, "so"?

817
00:52:41,424 --> 00:52:43,892
I don't want him
coming nowhere near you.

818
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:48,326
The thought of Chuck
just makes my stomach hurt.

819
00:52:49,966 --> 00:52:53,834
AII right. Well, I guess
we'II just have to talk about it Iater.

820
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:56,404
Good night.

821
00:52:56,573 --> 00:52:59,701
-Chuck.
-Nick.

822
00:53:06,316 --> 00:53:07,840
Chuck.

823
00:53:14,391 --> 00:53:15,881
Hey there, Iittle buddy.

824
00:53:16,593 --> 00:53:19,221
Chuck making
your stomach hurt too?

825
00:53:20,096 --> 00:53:22,724
Yeah, go ahead,
help yourself. It's okay.

826
00:53:22,899 --> 00:53:25,732
You seem Iike a nice guy.

827
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:28,697
Come to me.

828
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:34,939
Hey there, Iittle buddy.

829
00:53:36,313 --> 00:53:38,679
You wanna be my friend, don't you?

830
00:53:38,848 --> 00:53:40,873
Well, truth be told, I need a--

831
00:54:06,109 --> 00:54:07,098
Where is she?

832
00:54:07,277 --> 00:54:09,108
She went to a party
at Danny's house.

833
00:54:09,512 --> 00:54:10,774
Dry-rot Danny?

834
00:55:24,554 --> 00:55:27,022
Thanks for picking me up, man.

835
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:29,784
I remember sneaking out of
my bedroom when I was that age.

836
00:55:31,628 --> 00:55:34,062
Sweet, stolen kisses in the night.

837
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:36,994
-Sometimes more than kisses, right?
-Wrong.

838
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:40,330
-Right? Right?
-Wrong. Wrong.

839
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:45,137
Whatever they're doing,
I'm sure it's perfectly innocent.

840
00:55:45,308 --> 00:55:47,833
For goodness' sake,
she's almost grown up. She's 1 5.

841
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:50,775
She's only 1 3.
Practically a baby, man.

842
00:55:50,947 --> 00:55:53,916
I really don't wanna have this
conversation with you.

843
00:55:55,051 --> 00:55:56,313
Enough of this.

844
00:55:57,287 --> 00:56:00,484
Easy there, partner. That's my wife.

845
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:03,015
-That's your wife?
-Yeah.

846
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:05,491
-This is your wife?
-Right there.

847
00:56:15,338 --> 00:56:18,102
I Iove the way your family
treats you Iike an adult.

848
00:56:18,274 --> 00:56:22,142
Ever since Mom married Nick,
I've been treated Iike a kid.

849
00:56:22,612 --> 00:56:27,777
Well, you're way too
grown-up and pretty for that.

850
00:56:31,254 --> 00:56:33,188
-Lindsey.
-Nick?

851
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:38,289
You're busted. Now, get up,
because you're grounded.

852
00:56:38,461 --> 00:56:39,655
And you, you fired.

853
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:43,424
Whoa, whoa, whoa, brah.
Hang Ioose.

854
00:56:44,868 --> 00:56:50,738
Brah. You fired too. And your Iittle
brother. So hang Ioose with that, brah.

855
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:52,306
I hate you.

856
00:56:52,475 --> 00:56:56,536
Well, I'm not exactly your biggest fan
right now either. Go wait in the car.

857
00:56:56,713 --> 00:56:58,146
Chuck, Iet's go.

858
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:05,282
Chuck!

859
00:57:07,056 --> 00:57:08,489
Chuck!

860
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:10,620
Oh, Nick.

861
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:21,426
That was quite a night Iast night,
huh, Nick?

862
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:23,265
Hey, Linds-o.

863
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,374
Good morning, Lindsey.

864
00:57:26,176 --> 00:57:28,007
Lindsey. Good morning.

865
00:57:28,178 --> 00:57:30,043
Good morning.

866
00:57:31,347 --> 00:57:32,905
Looks Iike she's still mad at you.

867
00:57:33,082 --> 00:57:36,745
Yeah, well, this ain't
a popularity contest.

868
00:57:38,021 --> 00:57:39,511
Nick?

869
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:45,450
Chuck! Come here, man.

870
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:50,588
Need a hug?

871
00:57:50,767 --> 00:57:53,235
No, I don't need a hug.
I need my floors back.

872
00:57:53,703 --> 00:57:57,696
It's termites, Nick.
Straight up had to go.

873
00:58:05,248 --> 00:58:06,681
Want that hug now?

874
00:58:06,883 --> 00:58:09,477
I'm getting tired of this.

875
00:58:14,757 --> 00:58:16,588
You have one message.

876
00:58:16,759 --> 00:58:19,728
Mr. Persons,
love the magazine idea.

877
00:58:19,896 --> 00:58:22,956
But you are one month late
with the cover.

878
00:58:23,132 --> 00:58:25,191
I've stalled the board
as long as I can.

879
00:58:25,368 --> 00:58:26,960
Now it's my job on the line.

880
00:58:27,136 --> 00:58:31,266
So, Nick, if you can't get Magic,
we'll have to move on.

881
00:58:31,441 --> 00:58:34,604
Of course, that means refunding
your substantial cash advance.

882
00:58:34,777 --> 00:58:36,677
I know you understand.

883
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:39,610
Thanks, doll. Call me.

884
00:58:46,556 --> 00:58:51,289
And, wives, let's inhale,
taking in another deep breath.

885
00:58:51,461 --> 00:58:53,827
And give it away on sound.

886
00:58:56,799 --> 00:59:01,395
There we are.
And wives are now completely relaxed.

887
00:59:01,571 --> 00:59:02,697
What's going on here?

888
00:59:03,473 --> 00:59:04,462
Nick.

889
00:59:04,641 --> 00:59:06,768
We're doing a sympathetic
breathing and birth--

890
00:59:06,943 --> 00:59:08,035
Shut up.

891
00:59:08,778 --> 00:59:10,769
I can't believe you're doing this
with him.

892
00:59:10,947 --> 00:59:12,812
I can't believe you forgot
about our class.

893
00:59:12,982 --> 00:59:14,973
Inhaling and staying in the exercise.

894
00:59:15,151 --> 00:59:18,712
I'm trying to fix our house, which is
supposed to be Chuck's job.

895
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:21,083
Don't blame Chuck.
He's helping me right now.

896
00:59:21,257 --> 00:59:24,283
Big breath. Big breath.

897
00:59:26,663 --> 00:59:28,130
By rubbing all on you?

898
00:59:28,298 --> 00:59:30,528
No, Nick, by supporting me.

899
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:32,395
I support you.

900
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:34,002
I support her.

901
00:59:34,170 --> 00:59:37,936
I'm just trying to build our dream
house for us and the kids, that's all.

902
00:59:38,474 --> 00:59:42,433
Y'all just get back to relaxing.
Rub on the belly or something.

903
00:59:42,612 --> 00:59:47,413
You know, one of our mantras,
Nick, is that coupling is participation.

904
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:48,642
I know.

905
00:59:48,818 --> 00:59:50,809
What we're gonna do now
is take our hand...

906
00:59:50,987 --> 00:59:55,822
...and go in a circular motion
around and around....

907
00:59:55,992 --> 01:00:00,986
That's the baby's house,
be very gentle. Around.

908
01:00:01,164 --> 01:00:03,098
This may not be
the best time to tell you...

909
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:04,893
...your house needs
a new foundation.

910
01:00:05,068 --> 01:00:07,969
Don't Iet that interrupt the flow.

911
01:00:08,137 --> 01:00:12,005
-That's it! That's it!
-Nick!

912
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:16,010
Come on, Nick.

913
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:19,514
Somebody's having a bad day.
Now, be careful with that.

914
01:00:19,682 --> 01:00:23,049
That is New England mahogany trim!
I bent over backwards to get it for you.

915
01:00:23,219 --> 01:00:25,244
-What is up, Nick?
-This is what's up.

916
01:00:27,056 --> 01:00:28,648
-You played me!
-No.

917
01:00:28,825 --> 01:00:31,817
You knew this was a piece of junk
the minute you sold it to me.

918
01:00:31,995 --> 01:00:33,622
I knew the minute I met you...

919
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:36,822
...that this home was meant for you!
You just needed a Iittle push.

920
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,433
Well, here's my push.

921
01:00:40,870 --> 01:00:41,962
I should warn you, Nick.

922
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:45,801
I am trained in capoeira,
the Brazilian dance of war.

923
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:49,308
Yeah, I don't know karate,
but I know crazy.

924
01:00:55,351 --> 01:00:56,875
Oh, Nick!

925
01:01:00,189 --> 01:01:01,178
No!

926
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:06,390
That was a close one. Once it gets
going, man, is it hard to stop.

927
01:01:06,796 --> 01:01:09,890
Get off me. You are fired!

928
01:01:10,466 --> 01:01:14,334
What? Nick. Nickelback. Come on,
you can't blame me for all this.

929
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:18,099
No. I can. And I will. And I do!

930
01:01:18,274 --> 01:01:21,732
I blame you for everything, Chuck.
It's all your fault.

931
01:01:21,911 --> 01:01:25,938
I'm blaming you for the ozone Iayer,
global warming, the price on gas.

932
01:01:26,115 --> 01:01:27,480
It's all your fault.

933
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:32,451
So get off my property,
get out my face and get out my Iife.

934
01:01:32,622 --> 01:01:37,491
No, no, no, Nick. The good news here
is that all we need is some therapy.

935
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:41,096
Nick, we can work our way
through this, and guess what.

936
01:01:41,264 --> 01:01:44,563
I'm a Iicensed couples therapist.
I am.

937
01:01:44,734 --> 01:01:47,828
I see this tension happening
between contractors and clients...

938
01:01:48,004 --> 01:01:48,993
...all the time.

939
01:01:49,172 --> 01:01:51,003
It's the bread and butter
of my practice.

940
01:01:51,174 --> 01:01:53,233
But just admit this one thing to me.
One thing.

941
01:01:53,409 --> 01:01:54,740
What?

942
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:58,905
You never would've bought
this place if it hadn't been for me.

943
01:01:59,282 --> 01:02:00,510
Exactly.

944
01:02:00,683 --> 01:02:03,652
Why is that? I'II tell you why.
I'II tell you why that is.

945
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:06,986
Because I knew what you didn't.

946
01:02:07,457 --> 01:02:10,893
Yes, I knew there was
more work to be done here.

947
01:02:11,194 --> 01:02:13,594
But I also knew the value
of this place.

948
01:02:13,763 --> 01:02:15,390
I knew that when you were done...

949
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:17,829
...that this was gonna
be a home for your family...

950
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,936
...not some stinking house. I got them
up to here, they're a dime a dozen.

951
01:02:22,105 --> 01:02:24,767
But a home, a home, Nick.

952
01:02:25,608 --> 01:02:27,269
This is it.

953
01:02:27,443 --> 01:02:29,001
Your home.

954
01:02:29,812 --> 01:02:32,645
Does this Iook Iike a home to you?

955
01:02:35,551 --> 01:02:37,883
This is a mess!

956
01:02:38,054 --> 01:02:40,921
I need you out of here, right now.

957
01:02:41,791 --> 01:02:43,224
Well, if you--

958
01:02:43,392 --> 01:02:47,954
If you can't see the value of a home
as opposed to a house...

959
01:02:48,131 --> 01:02:51,362
...maybe I'm not your guy.

960
01:03:00,676 --> 01:03:01,768
Where y'all going?

961
01:03:02,178 --> 01:03:04,237
It's called Ioyalty, Mr. Persons.

962
01:03:04,413 --> 01:03:08,440
We work for Chuck.
And if he goes, we go.

963
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:10,245
Well, then go.

964
01:03:10,419 --> 01:03:13,980
I don't need none of you.
I can do it myself.

965
01:03:31,674 --> 01:03:33,904
I don't know what you
were thinking, Nick.

966
01:03:34,076 --> 01:03:37,637
You're gonna have to realize that
we're gonna have to hire Chuck back.

967
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:40,942
What? Oh, no, no.
That's never gonna happen, all right?

968
01:03:41,117 --> 01:03:42,482
Nobody takes me for a ride...

969
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:45,246
...so he's never stepping foot
in this house again.

970
01:03:45,421 --> 01:03:48,822
Chuck is caring, and he cares
about this family.

971
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:52,256
What he needs to do is move back
with his own family.

972
01:03:52,428 --> 01:03:55,920
It's not normal for a contractor
to Iive with his clients, Suzanne.

973
01:03:56,098 --> 01:03:59,124
I understand that, but it's been
fun having him around, Nick...

974
01:03:59,302 --> 01:04:00,929
...and he's great with the kids.

975
01:04:01,103 --> 01:04:05,506
No, he's not. He's the one tearing this
family apart, that's what he's doing.

976
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:08,610
He's the one tearing
this family apart?

977
01:04:09,212 --> 01:04:11,373
You're the one tearing
this family apart, Nick.

978
01:04:12,648 --> 01:04:14,309
-Me?
-Yes, you.

979
01:04:14,483 --> 01:04:17,543
With your insane obsession
with this house.

980
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:20,086
You don't have to worry
about that anymore.

981
01:04:20,256 --> 01:04:21,723
Got the perfect idea.

982
01:04:21,891 --> 01:04:23,916
This house is driving
everybody crazy...

983
01:04:24,093 --> 01:04:26,823
...so I say we just move on
and cut our Iosses.

984
01:04:26,996 --> 01:04:29,521
Oh, and where are we gonna go,
Nick, to your condo?

985
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:31,030
Anywhere but here.

986
01:04:32,902 --> 01:04:38,135
Nick. Nick. We cannot keep
uprooting our family Iike this.

987
01:04:38,307 --> 01:04:40,935
Who was the one crying
that we needed a bigger place?

988
01:04:41,110 --> 01:04:43,442
AII right? Now, I wouldn't
be stuck with this dump...

989
01:04:43,613 --> 01:04:46,707
...if it wasn't for you
and these ungrateful kids.

990
01:04:48,150 --> 01:04:49,378
Nick.

991
01:04:51,153 --> 01:04:52,780
Suzanne, I didn't mean that. Come--

992
01:04:52,955 --> 01:04:56,015
-Hold on. I didn't mean that.
-No. No. Don't touch me right now.

993
01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:58,785
I'm just under so much pressure.

994
01:04:58,961 --> 01:05:00,394
And I'm not under pressure?

995
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:04,294
I'm the one who's having babies
that I'm not even sure you want.

996
01:05:18,514 --> 01:05:20,641
I really think you're overreacting.

997
01:05:21,651 --> 01:05:24,950
I think we need to spend
some time apart, Nick.

998
01:05:26,088 --> 01:05:28,113
Come on, now.

999
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:32,352
When we first got here, these kids
were not happy about being here...

1000
01:05:32,528 --> 01:05:34,189
...but now they're vested in this.

1001
01:05:34,363 --> 01:05:37,924
So, what are we gonna do? Just take
that all away because it's difficult?

1002
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:39,829
Is that the thing you
wanna teach Kevin?

1003
01:05:40,002 --> 01:05:42,596
That when the going gets tough,
you just quit?

1004
01:05:43,739 --> 01:05:47,140
You should try putting that
on the cover of your magazine.

1005
01:05:48,411 --> 01:05:50,606
Look at you. I mean,
you quitting on me right now.

1006
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:54,511
I am not quitting,
I just need time to think.

1007
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:57,950
Suzanne.

1008
01:05:59,188 --> 01:06:01,247
Where you gonna go?

1009
01:06:08,431 --> 01:06:10,058
Oh, not you guys too?

1010
01:06:10,433 --> 01:06:11,957
Just cutting our Iosses.

1011
01:06:12,134 --> 01:06:13,624
Kevin, I know you understand.

1012
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:15,202
Not now, Nick, I'm busy.

1013
01:06:15,504 --> 01:06:17,836
Well, you're gonna thank me
when we out of here.

1014
01:06:18,307 --> 01:06:21,037
You city kids and you know it.

1015
01:06:22,611 --> 01:06:25,307
Coco, get in the house.

1016
01:06:26,882 --> 01:06:29,612
I said, get in the house,
you ignorant mutt.

1017
01:06:29,952 --> 01:06:31,647
Coco!

1018
01:06:37,426 --> 01:06:38,723
Coco.

1019
01:06:42,198 --> 01:06:44,029
I'm sorry.

1020
01:09:00,503 --> 01:09:02,095
What you doing?

1021
01:09:02,271 --> 01:09:06,037
Jason Winchell caught an 8-pound
bass and brought it to school.

1022
01:09:06,208 --> 01:09:08,005
Well, actually, just the head.

1023
01:09:08,410 --> 01:09:11,868
But it was so big, you could fit
your whole hand in its mouth.

1024
01:09:12,915 --> 01:09:14,678
Chuck was supposed
to take me fishing.

1025
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:17,580
That is, until you fired him.

1026
01:09:17,753 --> 01:09:20,620
You know what?
Why don't we just go now?

1027
01:09:21,590 --> 01:09:22,989
Really?

1028
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:24,990
Come on. Let's try it.

1029
01:09:32,201 --> 01:09:37,833
Hey. I know it's been kind of hard,
making the move and all.

1030
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:40,305
And I haven't actually been around.

1031
01:09:40,676 --> 01:09:43,509
Well, I've been around,
but I haven't been around, around.

1032
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:45,078
Know what I mean?

1033
01:09:45,247 --> 01:09:48,648
-Yeah.
-Well...

1034
01:09:48,817 --> 01:09:51,684
...I'm here to Iet you know
that all that's gonna change.

1035
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:54,516
Because FYI...

1036
01:09:54,857 --> 01:09:56,882
...I think you're a cool son.

1037
01:09:57,893 --> 01:09:59,588
Thanks.

1038
01:10:00,629 --> 01:10:02,062
And you're a cool dad.

1039
01:10:04,934 --> 01:10:06,333
Kevin!

1040
01:10:18,547 --> 01:10:19,673
What was that?

1041
01:10:19,848 --> 01:10:22,510
I don't know.
But he messed with the wrong kid.

1042
01:10:24,286 --> 01:10:25,878
Get him, Nick!

1043
01:10:41,403 --> 01:10:43,928
I got him! Stay back!

1044
01:10:44,106 --> 01:10:46,768
Yeah! You tell Jason Winchell
that the fish he caught...

1045
01:10:46,942 --> 01:10:50,571
...wasn't nothing but bait, baby!
Yeah!

1046
01:10:53,882 --> 01:10:56,476
Hey, hey. Hold up.

1047
01:10:56,652 --> 01:10:58,313
Forgetting something.

1048
01:10:58,487 --> 01:11:00,512
Lunch money.

1049
01:11:00,689 --> 01:11:03,021
Thanks. Bye.

1050
01:11:05,461 --> 01:11:08,294
-How's your mother?
-She's fine.

1051
01:11:09,164 --> 01:11:12,065
You're not gonna have
a heart attack out here, are you?

1052
01:11:12,601 --> 01:11:15,468
If I do, just pull my body
behind the shed.

1053
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:17,762
My pleasure.

1054
01:11:18,807 --> 01:11:20,707
Lindsey.

1055
01:11:20,876 --> 01:11:24,004
I know you're still mad at me,
but I'm trying to get it right.

1056
01:11:24,179 --> 01:11:28,138
It's a new family, a new house.
It's all new to me.

1057
01:11:28,317 --> 01:11:31,115
But I'II try to be
more understanding.

1058
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:35,246
Okay, okay, okay. I probably should've
handled the party a Iittle differently.

1059
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:39,886
I'm sorry, Nick.
I should've asked you.

1060
01:11:40,763 --> 01:11:42,822
Does this mean
I can see Danny again?

1061
01:11:43,799 --> 01:11:45,596
Don't push it.

1062
01:11:46,402 --> 01:11:48,666
Go ahead and make your bus.

1063
01:11:49,438 --> 01:11:52,498
-Good morning, Mr. Rooney.
-Hey, hi, sweetie.

1064
01:11:54,376 --> 01:11:58,676
Hey. This is for you.
Thought maybe you could use this.

1065
01:11:59,481 --> 01:12:00,573
How's the house coming?

1066
01:12:00,883 --> 01:12:02,214
It's coming.

1067
01:12:02,384 --> 01:12:03,908
Hey, how is Chuck doing?

1068
01:12:04,086 --> 01:12:05,348
Don't know and don't care.

1069
01:12:07,556 --> 01:12:10,218
Boy, I hope he's okay.
This is a tough time of year for him.

1070
01:12:10,592 --> 01:12:11,923
Oh, yeah? Why's that?

1071
01:12:12,094 --> 01:12:15,461
His wife. He Iost his wife a few years
back around this time of year.

1072
01:12:16,865 --> 01:12:18,332
You didn't know, did you?

1073
01:12:19,134 --> 01:12:21,694
Oh, yeah, she was
really something special.

1074
01:12:22,071 --> 01:12:24,005
He's never been the same since.

1075
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:26,903
She was his entire world.

1076
01:12:45,694 --> 01:12:48,322
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

1077
01:12:48,731 --> 01:12:50,358
I heard about EIIie.

1078
01:12:52,234 --> 01:12:53,792
Come in.

1079
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:15,585
Hey, I got a Iittle organic
herbal maté going here.

1080
01:13:15,758 --> 01:13:17,350
Thanks.

1081
01:13:18,494 --> 01:13:21,986
-Can I tell you something?
-Yeah, shoot.

1082
01:13:22,965 --> 01:13:25,433
When I was working on
your home with you...

1083
01:13:25,601 --> 01:13:27,193
...to me...

1084
01:13:27,970 --> 01:13:29,904
...it felt Iike family.

1085
01:13:30,072 --> 01:13:35,533
It felt Iike the special stuff,
you know? The stuff you hang on to.

1086
01:13:35,711 --> 01:13:38,771
Stuff that's gone missing
around here for quite some time.

1087
01:13:39,448 --> 01:13:40,847
It's funny, I....

1088
01:13:42,084 --> 01:13:44,609
I can't even go inside anymore.

1089
01:13:46,555 --> 01:13:48,420
Look, Nick...

1090
01:13:49,124 --> 01:13:51,422
...I know I screwed your Iife up.

1091
01:13:51,593 --> 01:13:56,155
And I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry,
you got no idea.

1092
01:13:56,331 --> 01:13:58,731
You didn't screw my Iife up.

1093
01:13:58,901 --> 01:14:00,630
I did.

1094
01:14:01,603 --> 01:14:04,128
And you'II always
be a part of my family.

1095
01:14:09,011 --> 01:14:11,741
I actually came over here
to make sure you was okay.

1096
01:14:12,114 --> 01:14:16,448
I was so upset about how things
were going over at your place, I just....

1097
01:14:16,618 --> 01:14:21,988
I went ahead and Iet Magic know that
you really, really need to speak to him.

1098
01:14:22,157 --> 01:14:26,093
Man, that's great. That's great, man.
I really need it.

1099
01:14:26,261 --> 01:14:29,355
While I was at it, I also happened
to have put my Realtor's cap on...

1100
01:14:29,531 --> 01:14:31,465
...and I made a couple
of phone calls.

1101
01:14:31,633 --> 01:14:33,931
I got a Russian banker
coming out here next Friday.

1102
01:14:34,102 --> 01:14:35,729
Just might be very motivated.

1103
01:14:35,904 --> 01:14:39,271
If you get the roof up on that place,
you might be able to flip it.

1104
01:14:39,441 --> 01:14:43,241
Get out from underneath
the whole thing.

1105
01:14:43,812 --> 01:14:46,042
Well, Iet me get the roof on.

1106
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:50,885
Do you have a nail gun with the
air compressor? The whole unit?

1107
01:14:51,053 --> 01:14:53,180
No. I'm old-school with it.

1108
01:14:53,355 --> 01:14:57,519
Oh, you're doing it old-school
between now and next Friday?

1109
01:14:58,060 --> 01:15:01,223
Maybe just borrow mine.
That'd be good.

1110
01:15:01,964 --> 01:15:05,365
Thanks, Chuck.
Thanks for everything.

1111
01:15:05,767 --> 01:15:07,257
You got it.

1112
01:15:37,499 --> 01:15:41,265
You can ground me Iater,
but right now, you need help.

1113
01:15:47,776 --> 01:15:51,576
Mr. P, the Iittle Pulu
has something to tell you.

1114
01:15:55,951 --> 01:15:57,145
I'm sorry about the party.

1115
01:15:57,719 --> 01:16:00,051
I should have never taken
Lindsey without asking you.

1116
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:02,080
You got that right.

1117
01:16:02,491 --> 01:16:04,721
And if it's all right with you...

1118
01:16:04,893 --> 01:16:07,555
...me and my brothers would
really Iike to finish this job.

1119
01:16:10,365 --> 01:16:14,699
Hey, fellas! I got some great news.
Tremendous news.

1120
01:16:14,870 --> 01:16:17,862
We are not just working
on a house anymore.

1121
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:21,305
From now on, we're committing
to finishing a home.

1122
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:25,107
You heard it, baby.
We're gonna finish Nick's home.

1123
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:27,043
Check that for dry rot.

1124
01:16:27,683 --> 01:16:30,743
You. I'm so darn proud
of you right now.

1125
01:16:30,919 --> 01:16:34,047
You're making me feel a Iittle
"Nickeladocious," I'm not gonna Iie.

1126
01:16:34,222 --> 01:16:37,817
I just wanna give you a hug on your
Nickelback, my old "Nickabocker."

1127
01:16:37,993 --> 01:16:39,824
My Nick at Nite.

1128
01:16:40,429 --> 01:16:41,862
Enough!

1129
01:16:42,864 --> 01:16:45,628
Well, you caught me just
in the "Nick o' time."

1130
01:16:46,568 --> 01:16:48,559
Is it a blessing or a curse?

1131
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:41,422
Go ahead, try it.

1132
01:17:44,926 --> 01:17:47,952
Let's go. Hey, hey, hey.

1133
01:17:56,805 --> 01:17:58,397
-Suzanne.
-Nick.

1134
01:17:58,573 --> 01:18:01,371
Now, before you say anything,
I need to get this out, okay?

1135
01:18:01,543 --> 01:18:04,842
-Okay.
-Now, you was right, and I was a fool.

1136
01:18:05,013 --> 01:18:06,913
The house is just a house...

1137
01:18:07,883 --> 01:18:10,443
...and it'd never be a home
without you and the kids and--

1138
01:18:10,619 --> 01:18:14,077
-Yes, baby, I get it.
-I'm almost finished.

1139
01:18:14,256 --> 01:18:17,885
Would you please consider forgiving
me and coming back home?

1140
01:18:18,293 --> 01:18:19,385
Babies.

1141
01:18:19,561 --> 01:18:22,325
Babies? You know, we can work
on that once you drop those two.

1142
01:18:22,497 --> 01:18:24,055
I don't think it's
a good idea to--

1143
01:18:24,232 --> 01:18:26,894
-Babies.
-Babies?

1144
01:18:27,235 --> 01:18:29,863
-Babies, Nick!
-Oh, babies!

1145
01:18:30,038 --> 01:18:32,905
Okay. Let me get you to the car.
Come on. Come on.

1146
01:18:33,075 --> 01:18:35,373
-Honey, how far is the hospital?
-About a half-hour.

1147
01:18:35,544 --> 01:18:37,034
Nick, we can't wait that Iong!

1148
01:18:37,212 --> 01:18:40,739
We gotta. That's where the doctors
and nurses and all the equipment--

1149
01:18:40,916 --> 01:18:44,113
-You're hurting my hand now.
-Honey, it is happening now!

1150
01:18:44,286 --> 01:18:45,651
-Now?
-Now!

1151
01:18:45,821 --> 01:18:48,312
Okay, kids, get them bags
in the house.

1152
01:18:48,490 --> 01:18:52,187
Look, your mom about to have what
she always wanted, a home birth.

1153
01:18:53,361 --> 01:18:56,524
Oh, Nick. I Iove the floors. Teak?

1154
01:18:56,698 --> 01:18:58,996
Oh, no. That's bubinga.

1155
01:19:01,770 --> 01:19:06,230
Nick, slow it down. I'm hot, honey.
I'm hot. Get it off.

1156
01:19:06,408 --> 01:19:07,966
Well, what now?

1157
01:19:08,143 --> 01:19:10,236
I don't know. I thought you knew.

1158
01:19:13,949 --> 01:19:15,678
What you trying to say, baby?

1159
01:19:15,851 --> 01:19:17,113
Chuck!

1160
01:19:17,285 --> 01:19:20,846
Chuck? I'II go this way!
I'II go this way!

1161
01:19:21,022 --> 01:19:23,183
Oh, Nick, I'm gonna kill you.

1162
01:19:23,358 --> 01:19:26,054
- For what?
-You did this to me.

1163
01:19:27,729 --> 01:19:30,357
Hello? Nickster, how we--?

1164
01:19:30,532 --> 01:19:32,124
You what?

1165
01:19:34,970 --> 01:19:40,772
Okay. Keep this Iine open.
Chuck is in the truck.

1166
01:19:52,287 --> 01:19:54,585
Oh, come on!

1167
01:20:01,163 --> 01:20:03,028
Okay.

1168
01:20:03,198 --> 01:20:05,428
Baby, is he on his way?

1169
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:07,500
That was him.
He's on his way. Don't worry.

1170
01:20:07,669 --> 01:20:09,534
-Everything gonna be fine.
-Are you sure?

1171
01:20:09,704 --> 01:20:11,638
Go wait for Chuck downstairs.

1172
01:20:19,314 --> 01:20:22,909
Hello? Nick? Chuck had
a Iittle trouble with the truck.

1173
01:20:23,084 --> 01:20:24,574
But don't worry, I'm on my way.

1174
01:20:24,753 --> 01:20:26,186
Man, just tell me what to do.

1175
01:20:26,354 --> 01:20:30,484
Okay, now, tell Suzanne to
stay calm, and to breathe.

1176
01:20:30,659 --> 01:20:32,718
Okay, you got to stay
calm and breathe.

1177
01:20:32,894 --> 01:20:34,418
-I'm breathing.
-She's breathing.

1178
01:20:34,596 --> 01:20:35,790
Now tell her to relax.

1179
01:20:35,964 --> 01:20:39,161
Maybe do the color imaging
we worked so very hard on.

1180
01:20:39,334 --> 01:20:40,892
Baby, relax!

1181
01:20:41,069 --> 01:20:42,161
Honey, I'm relaxing.

1182
01:20:42,337 --> 01:20:44,805
-Don't yell at me!
-Honey, I'm not yelling!

1183
01:20:44,973 --> 01:20:47,533
Keep her breathing, Nick.
Put Lindsey on the phone, please.

1184
01:20:47,876 --> 01:20:49,776
-He wants to talk to you.
-Why?

1185
01:20:51,146 --> 01:20:54,047
-Who knows? Here.
-Hey, Chuck.

1186
01:20:54,216 --> 01:20:56,184
I want you to Iisten very carefully.

1187
01:20:56,351 --> 01:20:57,978
I need you to grab me some things.

1188
01:20:58,153 --> 01:21:00,587
I need a bucket of hot water,
an oral thermometer...

1189
01:21:00,755 --> 01:21:04,748
...Iatex gloves, towels, a shoestring
and some jalapeño hot sauce.

1190
01:21:05,493 --> 01:21:07,256
Hot sauce?

1191
01:21:07,429 --> 01:21:09,363
Get that for me.
Put Nick on the phone.

1192
01:21:09,531 --> 01:21:11,396
-Okay, Chuck.
-I am almost there.

1193
01:21:11,566 --> 01:21:14,535
I want you to go into the bathroom
and get some hand sanitizer.

1194
01:21:14,703 --> 01:21:15,863
Don't tell me what to do.

1195
01:21:16,037 --> 01:21:19,063
I'm gonna go in the bathroom
and find the hand sanitizer.

1196
01:21:20,275 --> 01:21:21,572
Okay, got it. What now?

1197
01:21:21,743 --> 01:21:23,904
We're gonna use that
to sterilize your hands.

1198
01:21:24,079 --> 01:21:25,444
Why? I'm not touching nothing.

1199
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:26,939
Nick, you are.

1200
01:21:27,115 --> 01:21:30,141
Oh, God, they're coming! Honey?

1201
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:34,117
How far apart would you say
the contractions are?

1202
01:21:34,289 --> 01:21:36,757
Fast and furious, Chuck.
Fast and furious.

1203
01:21:36,925 --> 01:21:38,950
Pillow! I need a pillow.

1204
01:21:39,127 --> 01:21:40,492
Okay, game time, baby.

1205
01:21:40,662 --> 01:21:44,564
Go down there and see if
the first baby is crowning.

1206
01:21:44,733 --> 01:21:46,098
Come on, man, what that mean?

1207
01:21:46,268 --> 01:21:48,463
Can you see the baby?

1208
01:21:54,876 --> 01:21:56,741
Oh, God.

1209
01:21:56,912 --> 01:21:58,709
It's Iike the guppies all over again.

1210
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:00,609
-Honey?
-Chuck, he's down.

1211
01:22:00,782 --> 01:22:02,977
That's what the
jalapeño hot sauce is for.

1212
01:22:03,151 --> 01:22:05,312
Give him a Iittle dash of that.

1213
01:22:06,655 --> 01:22:08,122
Hold on.

1214
01:22:16,898 --> 01:22:17,887
He's back.

1215
01:22:18,066 --> 01:22:21,331
-Put your father back on the phone.
-Yeah.

1216
01:22:21,503 --> 01:22:25,234
I need you to go in there,
grab that baby's head, gently.

1217
01:22:25,407 --> 01:22:27,102
For God's sake, gently.

1218
01:22:27,509 --> 01:22:31,639
Give it a pull. Then take the
shoestring and tie off the cord.

1219
01:22:32,213 --> 01:22:37,412
-Hello? Hello?
-Hello? Hello?

1220
01:22:39,187 --> 01:22:42,179
I Iost him. Are you sure
you don't wanna try a hospital?

1221
01:22:43,892 --> 01:22:45,757
Guess that means no.

1222
01:22:45,927 --> 01:22:49,488
Oh, so close. I just missed
the state record. Let's--

1223
01:22:49,664 --> 01:22:51,825
-How's the patient doing here?
-Oh, Chuck.

1224
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,433
Let's go into our fun breathing.

1225
01:22:53,601 --> 01:22:56,161
Let's go into a deep, warm place,
and a quiet place.

1226
01:22:56,338 --> 01:22:58,636
Okay, quiet and deep.

1227
01:23:03,278 --> 01:23:05,269
Family, Iet's breathe together.

1228
01:23:06,848 --> 01:23:08,213
Now we're releasing on sound.

1229
01:23:11,386 --> 01:23:14,412
Nick, I can't take that noise.
I can't take that noise.

1230
01:23:14,589 --> 01:23:17,251
Hey, Iook, I'm having a baby.
I can't talk right now.

1231
01:23:17,425 --> 01:23:21,191
-Yo, Nick, it's Earvin Johnson.
-Magic?

1232
01:23:21,363 --> 01:23:23,263
Chuck Mitchell said you need
to talk to me.

1233
01:23:23,431 --> 01:23:26,025
Look, my wife having a baby
right now. We can't talk.

1234
01:23:26,201 --> 01:23:29,034
I remember when I had mine.

1235
01:23:30,438 --> 01:23:32,372
Yup. That's how I remembered it.

1236
01:23:32,540 --> 01:23:37,409
Tell Magic Chuck-dog said,
"Holler. Much respect. You the man."

1237
01:23:37,579 --> 01:23:41,037
Chuck-dog said,
"Much respect. You the man."

1238
01:23:41,216 --> 01:23:43,548
Tell Chuck-dog he's the man.

1239
01:23:44,586 --> 01:23:46,178
Yo, Chuck, he said you the man.

1240
01:23:46,354 --> 01:23:47,821
Oh, natch. That's so Magic.

1241
01:23:47,989 --> 01:23:51,186
Hey, man, what's up with the
Lakers, man? Y'all need a center.

1242
01:23:51,359 --> 01:23:52,883
He wants to talk to you, Chuck.

1243
01:23:53,061 --> 01:23:54,790
Roundy-round. Roundy-round.

1244
01:23:54,963 --> 01:23:56,260
Hello?

1245
01:23:56,431 --> 01:23:58,365
You got your hands full over there.

1246
01:23:58,533 --> 01:24:00,933
Ask Nick if he has
any more questions for me.

1247
01:24:01,102 --> 01:24:03,570
You have any questions
for the greatest point guard...

1248
01:24:03,738 --> 01:24:05,069
...in the history of the NBA?

1249
01:24:05,373 --> 01:24:08,467
Oh, yeah. In that '85 series
against the Celtics...

1250
01:24:08,643 --> 01:24:10,804
...was that a true crossover?
Because it Iooked--

1251
01:24:10,979 --> 01:24:12,412
Knock it off!

1252
01:24:12,580 --> 01:24:14,707
So gotta go. Bye, Buck.

1253
01:24:14,883 --> 01:24:17,374
-I need you, baby.
-Look, it's showtime now, okay?

1254
01:24:17,552 --> 01:24:21,989
-We got this. We got this. AII right?
-Okay. We got this. Okay.

1255
01:24:25,326 --> 01:24:27,521
Oh, God.

1256
01:24:31,166 --> 01:24:32,360
Told you it'd be beautiful.

1257
01:24:33,768 --> 01:24:38,705
Oh, before I forget, I got you
kind of a homewarming gift.

1258
01:24:40,542 --> 01:24:41,566
AII the best.

1259
01:24:43,445 --> 01:24:44,537
Yo, Chuck.

1260
01:24:46,781 --> 01:24:48,908
Thanks for coming back, man.

1261
01:24:49,384 --> 01:24:51,750
You kidding me?
I'm stuck on you, Nick.

1262
01:25:11,339 --> 01:25:12,738
And so it goes.

1263
01:25:12,907 --> 01:25:15,535
You know, sometimes life
throws you a changeup...

1264
01:25:15,710 --> 01:25:18,474
...and you've just got to adjust.

1265
01:25:21,683 --> 01:25:24,447
I never did finish
the sports magazine.

1266
01:25:24,619 --> 01:25:27,713
Instead, I started something
completely different.

1267
01:25:27,889 --> 01:25:31,017
A different magazine,
a lot closer to my heart...

1268
01:25:31,192 --> 01:25:33,592
...inspired by rebuilding this house.

1269
01:25:33,761 --> 01:25:36,821
It's called Are We Done Yet?

1270
01:25:36,998 --> 01:25:40,695
And that's the story on how
we built our dream house.

1271
01:25:43,371 --> 01:25:44,770
Thank you.

1272
01:25:48,076 --> 01:25:51,842
So I want to thank you all for coming.
Enjoy the party.
