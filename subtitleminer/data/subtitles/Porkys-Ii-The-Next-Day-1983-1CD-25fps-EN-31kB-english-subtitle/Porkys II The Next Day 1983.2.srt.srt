1
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,400
- They're for you.
- What am I gonna do with 'em?

2
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:10,800
We thought you'd like to wear one today.

3
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,200
Shit!

4
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,700
OK, here comes your night to remember!

5
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,000
Here she comes.

6
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,500
She's almost got it. She's almost got it!

7
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,400
She's got it!

8
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,400
Come on, shit for brains!

9
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:58,700
- What do you mean, break Pee Wee's cherry?
- If you're not cherry, you don't get Wendy.

10
00:02:58,735 --> 00:03:03,800
I'm cherry. You could put me on
top of a banana split, I'm so cherry.

11
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:34,200
Make it mine. Make it mine.

12
00:03:34,235 --> 00:03:36,100
Please make itmine.

13
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,300
I got laid!

14
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,900
I got laid. I tore her up.

15
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,600
She's ruined.

16
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,400
Where's stiffy? Stiffy!

17
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,600
Maybe it doesn't work
for a couple of days after you get laid.

18
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,600
Up, you big husky! Up!

19
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,800
Shit.

20
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,200
Marilyn Monroe.

21
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,600
Jayne Mansfield.

22
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,800
Shit!

23
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,050
Got a bad rash, Mom.

24
00:05:28,085 --> 00:05:30,400
Hurts like heck.

25
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,700
I don't think I'll ask.

26
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,600
- Hey, Casanova!
- Hey, stud, how does it feel?

27
00:06:05,635 --> 00:06:08,000
Listen, about this Shakespeare crap.

28
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:10,100
- Shakespeare crap?
- Stop!

29
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:15,600
- You're getting me in trouble with Mom.
- It's not my fault she's a drama teacher.

30
00:06:15,635 --> 00:06:20,100
Just because you don't mind looking like
a jerk, Mom thinks I shouldn't mind either.

31
00:06:20,135 --> 00:06:23,600
- Shakespeare's good for you.
- Shakespeare's ass sucks canal water.

32
00:06:23,635 --> 00:06:26,165
His ass sucks canal water.
That's very profound.

33
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,000
- He has a keen analytical mind.
- And a way with words.

34
00:06:29,035 --> 00:06:32,665
Hey, Pee Wee. How's it feel? Getting laid.

35
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:36,365
- Same as it always feels.
- Oh, I don't believe it.

36
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,400
What do you mean?
I got bodies laid all over South Florida.

37
00:06:39,435 --> 00:06:42,617
Morris, the last time you got
any action was with your fist.

38
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:45,800
You guys are jealous because
I ruined Wendy for everybody else.

39
00:06:45,835 --> 00:06:49,200
- Oh, no!
- Now that she's had me, what's left?

40
00:06:49,235 --> 00:06:51,600
Yeah, well, that's not what she told me.

41
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,800
- What did she tell you?
- Ask her, Pee Wee. Here she comes.

42
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,100
Yeah, I can hear her pantin' from here.

43
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:03,300
When they've been had by Pee Wee
Morris, they can't keep their hands off me.

44
00:07:03,335 --> 00:07:07,400
And watch out, cos when she sees me
you might get caught in the stampede.

45
00:07:07,435 --> 00:07:09,017
Watch this.

46
00:07:09,052 --> 00:07:10,600
Hi, boys.

47
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,165
- She's in a frenzy.
- She's rabid.

48
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,700
- She didn't know I was here.
- That's what she said about you last night.

49
00:07:17,735 --> 00:07:19,500
Oh, man. The girl's my slave.

50
00:07:19,535 --> 00:07:21,500
Wendy!

51
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,065
Hey, Wendy!

52
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:27,450
- Hey, baby. How's tricks?
- You talkin' to me?

53
00:07:27,485 --> 00:07:30,765
Well, yeah. I'm talkin' to you.
How you feelin'?

54
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,900
To tell you the truth, I'm a little horny.
I haven't had too much action lately.

55
00:07:34,935 --> 00:07:36,300
Is that so?

56
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,900
In fact, if I don't get next to a man soon,
I'm gonna be in real trouble.

57
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,000
You guys are as funny as a rubber crutch.

58
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,000
- Thanks a lot, kid.
- Oh, Pee Wee, come on. It's just a little joke.

59
00:07:48,035 --> 00:07:51,200
They made me do it.
They said they'd never let me see you again.

60
00:07:51,235 --> 00:07:54,465
If that happened,
I'd just have to go into a convent.

61
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:59,100
I mean, after you, where's a girl to go?
It's all downhill from here.

62
00:07:59,135 --> 00:08:02,900
- That's what I was tryin' to tell 'em.
- Well, you were right.

63
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,050
- When?
- How about lunchtime?

64
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:08,700
- OK.
- Gotta go. See you later.

65
00:08:08,735 --> 00:08:10,800
Bye.

66
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,300
Look closer. That is the world's
record shit-eatin' grin.

67
00:08:17,335 --> 00:08:20,365
- I don't know how you do it, Pee Wee.
- I'm an artist.

68
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:25,000
Michelangelo worked in stone.
Van Gogh worked in oil. I work in pussy.

69
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,550
- He works in pussy.
- At least he's consistent.

70
00:08:29,585 --> 00:08:32,500
- Let's get him.
- I think he needs some more.

71
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,100
I think he does.

72
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,300
Hey, Pee Wee!

73
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,900
If you got all this pussy lyin' around,
you should share with your buddies.

74
00:08:41,935 --> 00:08:44,900
- We share with you.
- Oh, yeah. Like Cherry Forever.

75
00:08:44,935 --> 00:08:47,765
A mere dalliance, my boy. A life experience.

76
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,400
We should all learn to run
from guys with machetes.

77
00:08:50,435 --> 00:08:52,265
As early in life as possible.

78
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,400
I think you should fix us up
with some ofyour stuff.

79
00:08:55,435 --> 00:08:58,365
- Sure, I'll fix you up.
- Yeah? When?

80
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,965
- Well, hell, any time.
- How about tomorrow night?

81
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,200
Tomorrow night? It might take me a couple
of days to line up some first-class stuff.

82
00:09:06,235 --> 00:09:09,500
I gotta talk 'em into goin' for
other guys. They're pretty loyal.

83
00:09:09,535 --> 00:09:12,800
- Oh, yeah. I can imagine.
- Of course they would be.

84
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,100
Shit.

85
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,500
Hi.

86
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,200
- You still suspended?
- Three more days.

87
00:09:30,235 --> 00:09:32,000
Shit.

88
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,665
You're right. 5:10 on the nose.

89
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,900
I told you.
She goes to the bathroom 5:10 every day.

90
00:09:44,935 --> 00:09:48,600
- Every day?
- Every day. 5:10 every day.

91
00:09:48,635 --> 00:09:50,665
You can set your watch by it.

92
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,800
- She's German, you know.
- Very interesting.

93
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:58,500
Yeah? What's so interesting about when
Miss Balbricker goes to the bathroom?

94
00:09:58,535 --> 00:10:01,400
A little experiment I got for zoology class.

95
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:03,500
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

96
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,365
- Hey, Stemrick!
- What do you want, Pee Wee?

97
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:19,150
- You get a lot of action, just like me.
- Yeah, I get my share.

98
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:22,900
I promised to set Turner and some
of the guys up with some pussy.

99
00:10:22,935 --> 00:10:24,865
I don't wanna give 'em my choice stuff.

100
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:28,300
- They're pretty inexperienced.
- Yeah, you don't wanna do that.

101
00:10:28,335 --> 00:10:31,200
So I wondered ifyou knew
a broad that's a real pushover.

102
00:10:31,235 --> 00:10:33,867
Somebody a real idiot could score with.

103
00:10:33,902 --> 00:10:36,500
Hell, man. That's easy. Wendy Williams.

104
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,965
- Hey, Stemrick.
- Yeah?

105
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,600
Your sister sucks rhinoceros dicks.

106
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,000
I wonder what he meant by that?

107
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,165
Hold the splits, girls.

108
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,200
Let's get ready
for the tongue exercise. Ready?

109
00:10:58,235 --> 00:11:01,600
All right. Up! Out! Right! Left! Down!

110
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,500
Hey, what the hell
did Pee Wee do to Stemrick?

111
00:11:06,535 --> 00:11:09,065
He's pissed as shit and lookin' for Pee Wee.

112
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:13,700
I think he asked Big John if he could
fix us up with his sister for a gangbang.

113
00:11:13,735 --> 00:11:18,300
Could be. He's desperate enough. Boys,
I think we got his ass in a sling this time.

114
00:11:18,335 --> 00:11:20,200
Yeah, well. Serves him right.

115
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,565
Hey, Billy?

116
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,800
- What kinda role you playin'?
- I'm playin' a couple of roles, actually.

117
00:11:28,835 --> 00:11:31,700
I'm doin' different scenes
from different plays.

118
00:11:31,735 --> 00:11:34,700
- What roles?
- Macbeth.

119
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,300
- I heard ofthat.
- Yeah.

120
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,000
What's the other role?

121
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:46,300
- Oberon.
- Oberon? Who's he?

122
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,500
He's sort of like a... forest ranger.

123
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,165
A forest ranger? In Shakespeare?

124
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:58,365
Yeah. He looks after the woods. You know.

125
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:02,100
- Looks after the woods?
- Yes. He runs around in the woods a lot.

126
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,500
- He sounds like a fairy to me.
- He's notjust a fairy.

127
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,200
He's the king ofthe fairies.

128
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:13,700
Oh, you mean like a really big fairy.

129
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,100
You guys are really funny.

130
00:12:17,135 --> 00:12:18,765
Hysterical.

131
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,150
Come on, guys. Let's get serious.
This is art here.

132
00:12:22,185 --> 00:12:25,500
- I think it's really admirable, Billy.
- I bet you do.

133
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,165
So.

134
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,700
So you're playin' a big fairy?

135
00:12:32,735 --> 00:12:34,765
Yeah.

136
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,800
Well, that's good casting.

137
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,500
Hey, Turner, suck my wand!

138
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,800
- Frank.
- What's up, Pee Wee?

139
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,100
You wanna get back at Turner
for that Cherry Forever gag?

140
00:12:59,135 --> 00:13:01,665
- You know I would. Why?
- I'll tell ya later.

141
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:05,300
We gotta find a broad who
they'll believe is ready for a gangbang.

142
00:13:05,335 --> 00:13:08,465
Someone who's like a door knob?
Everybody takes a turn?

143
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:12,300
- It's easy. Wendy Williams.
- Never mind her. Somebody else.

144
00:13:12,335 --> 00:13:16,100
- Somebody that they don't know.
- All right. Let me see.

145
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:20,900
This girl in the band, Big Edna, is supposed
to be hot. I heard, mind you. I wasn't there.

146
00:13:20,935 --> 00:13:24,800
I heard she was about to take on 20 guys
on the way home from the Daytona trip.

147
00:13:24,835 --> 00:13:27,800
Some ofthe fruitcakes in the band
didn't know what to do.

148
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,265
- It figures. Big Edna.
- I mean big. Six foot.

149
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:34,400
Listen, Pee Wee.
Take this over to that lab monitor for me.

150
00:13:34,435 --> 00:13:36,500
- Oh, yeah. Sure.
- Thanks.

151
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,200
Gee, that's very funny, Morris.

152
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,500
Pee Wee.

153
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,365
Pee Wee, it's not that bad.

154
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:53,200
Tell those guys the members ofyour harem
don't want to make it with a bunch ofjerks.

155
00:14:53,235 --> 00:14:56,200
- That's what you'd do, huh?
- I don't have a harem.

156
00:14:56,235 --> 00:14:58,200
Oh, that's not what I hear.

157
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,465
What'd you hear?

158
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,700
I was asking who's the biggest pushover
in school. You know what everybody said?

159
00:15:07,735 --> 00:15:09,700
- Wendy Williams?
- Right.

160
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,500
It can't be the first time
you've heard that stuff.

161
00:15:13,535 --> 00:15:15,717
- That's different.
- Why?

162
00:15:15,752 --> 00:15:17,900
Before, I wanted it to be true.

163
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,800
And I guess now I don't.

164
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,900
Well, that's good. Because it's not true.

165
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,200
- It isn't?
- No.

166
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:35,965
- You don't believe me?
- You went on the bus with me, just like that.

167
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,700
That's like the old joke "I wouldn't belong to
any club that would have me as a member. "

168
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,600
Pee Wee, don't you know why I did that?

169
00:15:44,635 --> 00:15:46,700
Yeah. The bet with Tommy.

170
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,200
I did it because I liked you

171
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,900
and because I wanted to.

172
00:15:53,935 --> 00:15:56,000
You did?

173
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:01,300
- You do it every time you want to?
- Yup. Every time I want to.

174
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,600
It's just that I've only wanted to three times.

175
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,000
Really?

176
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,965
Tommy - you knew that.

177
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,500
Some guy you don't know at summer camp.

178
00:16:16,535 --> 00:16:18,600
And you.

179
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,165
Well, why are all these assholes
talking about you like that?

180
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:29,200
Most guys are so desperate, they'll lie about
anybody to make themselves look like studs.

181
00:16:29,235 --> 00:16:33,400
Didn't you ever brag about some girl
you never really made it with?

182
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,800
Well, I can't believe they'd make all that up.

183
00:16:36,835 --> 00:16:38,900
You know how I got my reputation?

184
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,765
In the eighth grade.

185
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,900
I didn't know anything. I mean...

186
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:49,200
These guys tried to get me
to go skinny-dipping.

187
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:53,500
I didn't want to, but I didn't care
if they did so I watched.

188
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,500
I thought it was funny, you know.

189
00:16:56,535 --> 00:16:58,600
Flopping around.

190
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,465
Oh, God.

191
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,600
The next day in school, I was a slut.

192
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,400
I mean, the original mattress-back.

193
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,400
I got used to it.

194
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,500
What do they know about me?

195
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,100
I do what I want.
I don't care what anybody thinks.

196
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,300
Well... I mean, don't you care what I think?

197
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,600
I care.

198
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,400
But I can't tell you what to think.

199
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,600
I can only tell you the truth.

200
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,865
Oh, boy.

201
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,600
Well? We gonna be buddies?

202
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,400
First, I'm gonna have to get into shape.

203
00:17:51,435 --> 00:17:53,765
Yeah, why?

204
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:59,500
Cos I'm gonna kick the shit out ofthese guys!
I don't want 'em talkin' about my girl like that.

205
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,200
Come on, kids! Let's go.

206
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,600
- Shit.
- That's your cue.

207
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:16,000
We got somethin' cookin'
for your Cherry Forever revenge.

208
00:18:16,035 --> 00:18:18,365
Who's "we" and how
did you know about that?

209
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,100
"We" is Brian and me. And what do you
mean, how do I know? I look after my guy.

210
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:26,517
- We even know where to get the girl.
- Don't worry. I got a lead.

211
00:18:26,552 --> 00:18:29,900
- What's the plan?
- We're still workin' on it. I'll tell you tonight.

212
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,700
Big Edna?

213
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,200
- Hi. I'm Pee Wee Morris.
- I know.

214
00:18:59,235 --> 00:19:01,365
You do? Ah, well, that figures.

215
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:05,400
I heard you had a little problem
with the boys in the band the other night.

216
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,700
Edna, I have some guys that won't
let you down. You know what I mean?

217
00:19:10,735 --> 00:19:11,665
No.

218
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:15,800
Come on, Edna. A big girl like you takes
a lot of men to keep you satisfied, right?

219
00:19:15,835 --> 00:19:20,300
- What are you talking about?
- Come on, you know what I'm talkin' about!

220
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,200
- I don't.
- Edna, come here.

221
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,200
- I wonder what he's up to.
- Who knows.

222
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,600
- What do you think?
- No way.

223
00:19:31,635 --> 00:19:34,000
Gangbang?

224
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,000
Dirty, rotten, filthy little creep!

225
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,500
- Are you OK?
- I take it that was a no.

226
00:19:47,535 --> 00:19:50,365
- She's thinking it over.
- You're funny.

227
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,765
Look, don't worry about it.
We'll switch to plan B.

228
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:57,200
- Plan B? I don't even know what plan A was.
- Here's what we'll do.

229
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,800
Yet I will try the last.

230
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,100
Lay on, Macduff,

231
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,500
And damn'd be he
that first cries "Hold, enough!"

232
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,500
No, not you.

233
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,400
Shakespeare. The... play.

234
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:22,265
- I'm glad I don't have to eat these.
- You seen Billy around?

235
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:26,700
- Don't bug him, he's studying his role.
- He's studying, you ignorant oafs.

236
00:20:26,735 --> 00:20:30,800
- I got a role he can study.
- He's not ready for a role that big, yet.

237
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,400
Hey, Mickey!

238
00:20:33,435 --> 00:20:35,000
Suckers.

239
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,200
Hey, McCarty.

240
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,800
Can we have your autograph?

241
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:44,400
Look, you guys, when I become a big star
and I'm rubbing elbows with Ava Gardner,

242
00:20:44,435 --> 00:20:48,300
- you're the first people I intend to forget.
- That's Hollywood.

243
00:20:48,335 --> 00:20:51,565
"Gentle Puck, come hither. "
What the fuck's a puck?

244
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:57,100
It's a character. It's a friend of Oberon's.
He's like a... a little forest ranger.

245
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,100
- Puck? A little forest ranger?
- Yes.

246
00:21:00,135 --> 00:21:02,665
- Well, who plays that part?
- Pee Wee.

247
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:08,300
Oh. So Pee Wee plays the little fairy and
you play a big fairy. That's a lot offairies.

248
00:21:08,335 --> 00:21:11,065
You guys get to run around
the woods together?

249
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:15,800
You guys must be really proud ofyour
ignorance cos you show it off so much.

250
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,900
- John Henry.
- Yes, I know.

251
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,100
Tell Mrs Morris I'll take the part.

252
00:21:32,135 --> 00:21:34,700
I will. I'm glad.

253
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,065
- Is he in the show?
- Well, he is now.

254
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:46,865
- He's a Seminole.
- Observant, Tim. Real observant.

255
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:51,400
No, no, no. I just meant that...
some people might not care for that.

256
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,700
- Well, it's all right with me.
- Me too.

257
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,765
- We're gonna see the broad tonight?
- Right.

258
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:02,000
- Do you think they'll go for it?
- Ifyou keep your cool.

259
00:22:02,035 --> 00:22:05,200
- Just think of it as an acting lesson.
- Cool. Right.

260
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,700
- Tomorrow night at 11 o'clock.
- Right.

261
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,700
- It'll work, right? Graveyard Gloria, right?
- Right.

262
00:22:14,735 --> 00:22:16,700
- Cool, right?
- Right.

263
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,700
- You could be the biggest fairy of 'em all.
- Eat my shorts.

264
00:22:22,735 --> 00:22:25,665
Hey, you guys, how they hangin'?

265
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:30,900
Cut it out, for Christ's sake! I come here with
an offer of a lifetime and you act like children.

266
00:22:30,935 --> 00:22:34,900
- We're sorry. What's your offer?
- Forget it. Billy, let's go.

267
00:22:34,935 --> 00:22:37,665
You wanna sample the greatest ass
in five counties?

268
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:41,500
- What ass is this?
- Get this. By day, a mild-mannered librarian.

269
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,865
She looks like a buttoned-up icebox.

270
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:47,900
But you get her near a cemetery
and she'll ride you into the ground!

271
00:22:47,935 --> 00:22:51,765
I'm not kiddin'. They call her
"Graveyard Gloria, the fuck of death. "

272
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:55,865
I got it all lined up! You wanna act like
men for a change and take a shot at this?

273
00:22:55,900 --> 00:23:00,500
- I don't know. Do you wanna give her a shot?
- Yeah, but it might spoil it for the rest ofyou.

274
00:23:00,535 --> 00:23:03,100
Why not? She's gotta have
some curiosity value.

275
00:23:03,135 --> 00:23:05,165
I got it all worked out for you.

276
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,700
- How about you, McCarty?
- Oh, I just love graveyards.

277
00:23:08,735 --> 00:23:11,100
- But can't we rehearse first?
- Sure, Billy.

278
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,465
See you, Rock.

279
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,600
- Graveyard Gloria, my ass.
- I wonder where he dug her up?

280
00:23:17,635 --> 00:23:20,100
That's funny. Not as funny
as your face, but funny.

281
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:25,000
- The little booger's up to something.
- We're gonna have to keep an eye on him.

282
00:23:25,035 --> 00:23:28,000
How we gonna do that?
He's in rehearsal all day.

283
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,100
Well, Anthony, you always
wanted to be an actor.

284
00:23:32,135 --> 00:23:34,365
Me, an actor? No fuckin' way.

285
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,100
You gotta be kiddin'. It'll never happen.
Count on it.

286
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,865
Thanks for coming by, Anthony.

287
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:57,200
I just figured I'd... kinda like,
ask you a question.

288
00:23:57,235 --> 00:24:00,200
I mean, is this guy, like... Is he, like...

289
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,100
No.

290
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:09,200
How come he has to wear,
you know, clothes like this?

291
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,700
Well, he's pretending to be a girl.

292
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:16,000
Just pretending? OK.

293
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,500
Will you read Thisbe's speech on page 120?

294
00:24:19,535 --> 00:24:21,200
Yeah.

295
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:26,300
"O wall, full often
hast thou heard my moans. "

296
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,265
Pretty good, huh?

297
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:33,400
Anthony, can you get
your voice a little higher?

298
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,600
Well, he's pretending to be a girl.

299
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,200
"My cherry lips... "

300
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,200
A little higher, Anthony. Come on.

301
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,900
"And I like Helen, till the Fates me... "

302
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,365
This isn't gonna work.

303
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,400
I just got a naturally deep voice. You know.

304
00:24:58,435 --> 00:25:01,800
I just naturally got a man's voice.

305
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,400
Really neat disguise.

306
00:25:39,435 --> 00:25:41,400
Yeah!

307
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,400
I think I'm going to regret this.

308
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,400
Shit.

309
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,700
Graveyard Gloria?
Why not? Sounds like fun.

310
00:26:35,735 --> 00:26:37,900
- You got a deal.
- That's great.

311
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,065
Rex, shut up!

312
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,200
Gosh, he's so possessive.

313
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,800
- OK, Friday night. Good night.
- See you later, boys.

314
00:26:46,835 --> 00:26:49,800
- They're gonna shit. Definitely.
- Definitely.

315
00:26:49,835 --> 00:26:51,900
Oh, definitely.

316
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,600
- What do you want?
- Is Gloria in?

317
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,765
- Who wants her?
- We wanna talk some business.

318
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:15,000
- She ain't interested.
- We brought along a few friends of ours.

319
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,000
Oh, well...

320
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,100
Any friend ofyours is a friend of ours.

321
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,200
That is great. Nice, nice.

322
00:27:29,235 --> 00:27:31,100
Very good. Next!

323
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:42,400
Lovely! Oh, just wonderful.

324
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,100
Next!

325
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:50,000
All right, who's supposed to be next?
Let's move it.

326
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,100
Come on, folks. Let's get with it, please.

327
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,000
All right, who's supposed to be next?

328
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:04,500
- It's Pee Wee.
- Oh. I see.

329
00:28:04,535 --> 00:28:05,400
Pee Wee!

330
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:11,600
- I'm not comin' out.
- Pee Wee, get out here right now.

331
00:28:11,635 --> 00:28:14,700
All we need is a brief look at the costume.

332
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:16,265
No way.

333
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:21,600
Pee Wee, you get out here right now or you're
sitting out the rest ofthe baseball season.

334
00:28:21,635 --> 00:28:24,500
- Mom, I can't. Everybody'll laugh.
- Nobody will laugh.

335
00:28:24,535 --> 00:28:27,100
- Yes, they will.
- No, they won't.

336
00:28:27,135 --> 00:28:30,900
- Will anybody laugh?
- No.

337
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,700
Get the curtain.

338
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,700
It looks great, Pee Wee.

339
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,000
- Nice horn, buddy.
- Love your dress, Meat.

340
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,500
Nice tail.

341
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:59,200
Excellent, costumers.
Very good. Very creative.

342
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:03,700
- All right, let's get on with it.
- You're not gettin' on with anything.

343
00:29:03,735 --> 00:29:07,965
- I beg your pardon?
- Rise, flock, and follow.

344
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,600
Excuse me. This is a closed rehearsal.
We don't open for...

345
00:29:11,635 --> 00:29:14,565
This show is never gonna open.

346
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,165
Miss Balbricker.
To what do I owe this pleasure?

347
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:22,400
Oh, it's no pleasure, I assure you, Morris.
I'm here to lend support to Reverend Flavel.

348
00:29:22,435 --> 00:29:27,700
And I'm the spiritual leader ofthe
Righteous Flock, Reverend Bubba Flavel.

349
00:29:27,735 --> 00:29:30,365
Bubble Flavour?

350
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:34,400
Bubba Flavel, Mrs Morris.
Reverend Bubba Flavel.

351
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:39,265
- It is Mrs Morris, is it not?
- The last time I looked.

352
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:44,700
Would you put cow puckeys in
these children's mouths, Mrs Morris?

353
00:29:44,735 --> 00:29:46,700
What?

354
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,500
Or dog oogies?

355
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:53,700
Or pelican snot?

356
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:57,300
Excuse me, I am going to be ill.

357
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,400
This is Shakespeare. It is not filth.

358
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:07,000
Oh, yes. I know, that's the official position
of the academic community. However...

359
00:30:07,035 --> 00:30:09,900
Exactly what are you trying
to tell us, Reverend Flavel?

360
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:15,600
We're closing you down, Morris.
Closing you down.

361
00:30:15,635 --> 00:30:17,965
- On whose authority?
- God's.

362
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,700
- The Righteous Flock's.
- So sayeth the shepherd.

363
00:30:21,735 --> 00:30:23,800
So sayeth the flock.

364
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:27,600
If that's not good enough,
we'll go to the principal.

365
00:30:27,635 --> 00:30:29,900
Then let's do that, Miss Balbricker.

366
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:33,700
Let's just do that. Right now.

367
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,765
Mr Carter, there's a mob here to see you.

368
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:44,900
- Do they have an appointment, Betty?
- God always has an appointment!

369
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:57,000
Come on, Mr Carter.

370
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,500
Well, Reverend. What is the problem now?

371
00:31:04,535 --> 00:31:07,365
What is the problem?

372
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,865
The problem is fornication.

373
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,765
- So sayeth the shepherd.
- So sayeth the flock.

374
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:16,900
Sister Balbricker. Open your book.
You play the woman's part.

375
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Shakespeare is trash!
I'll give proof. Listen to this!

376
00:31:22,035 --> 00:31:25,165
"If I be waspish, best beware of my sting!"

377
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,800
"Who knows not
where a wasp does wear his sting?"

378
00:31:28,835 --> 00:31:31,565
Get this: "In his tail. "

379
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,865
- "In his tongue. "
- "Whose tongue?"

380
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:39,200
"Yours, ifyou talk oftails: And so, farewell. "

381
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:43,065
"What? With my tongue in your tail?"

382
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:46,550
Now, there's no mistaking
his intention. No, sir.

383
00:31:46,585 --> 00:31:49,792
He intends to put his tongue
in a woman's tail.

384
00:31:49,827 --> 00:31:53,000
What kind of man would do a thing like that?

385
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:58,000
Reverend, here is the Bible.
Now... Now, listen.

386
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,200
Just a moment. Listen.

387
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:05,000
"And my beloved put in his hand
by the hole ofthe door

388
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:08,000
and my bowels were moved for him. "

389
00:32:08,035 --> 00:32:09,765
Song of Solomon. Chapter 5.

390
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:14,600
- The devil can cite scripture for his purpose.
- He can cite Shakespeare too, Reverend.

391
00:32:14,635 --> 00:32:18,565
I have read Solomon and Job and Isaiah

392
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:23,200
and Jeremiah and Malachi
and Matthew and Mark and Luke and John.

393
00:32:23,235 --> 00:32:25,900
- And nowhere...
- He forgot Sneezy and Doc.

394
00:32:25,935 --> 00:32:28,400
Nowhere do I find the likes ofthis.

395
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,365
Midsummer Night's Dream. Act V. Scene I.

396
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:36,300
"The iron tongue of midnight
hath told twelve;

397
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:42,600
Lovers, to bed; 'tis almost fairy time. "

398
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:45,550
Good God! It's enough
to make a real man sick.

399
00:32:45,585 --> 00:32:48,200
- So sayeth the shepherd.
- So sayeth the flock.

400
00:32:48,235 --> 00:32:51,065
"And Abraham was 90 years old and nine

401
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:58,000
when he was circumcised in the flesh
of his foreskin. " Genesis 17.

402
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:04,000
A MidsummerNight's Dream. Act IV, scene I.

403
00:33:04,035 --> 00:33:06,265
"I could munch your good dry oats. "

404
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:09,465
- So sayeth the shepherd.
- So sayeth the flock.

405
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:14,000
"And thy navel is like a rounded
goblet which wanteth not liquor. "

406
00:33:14,035 --> 00:33:16,100
Solomon 7, verse 2.

407
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
And King Lear. Act IV. Scene VI.

408
00:33:21,035 --> 00:33:23,500
"Let copulation thrive!"

409
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:27,600
- So sayeth the shepherd.
- So sayeth the flock.

410
00:33:27,635 --> 00:33:30,400
"And when the Lord saw Leah was hated,

411
00:33:30,435 --> 00:33:32,500
he opened up her womb. "

412
00:33:32,535 --> 00:33:34,700
Genesis 24:31.

413
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:41,565
Vile! Blasphemous!

414
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,365
Intolerable! Shakespeare must go!

415
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:49,800
- So sayeth the shepherd.
- So sayeth the flock.

416
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,800
God damn you, you...

417
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,700
What sayeth you, Mr Carter?

418
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,500
Get the flock outta here!

419
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:15,000
All right, Mr Carter!

420
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,900
This means war.

421
00:34:24,935 --> 00:34:26,800
Holy war!

422
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,100
Flock, follow!

423
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,000
Thank you.

424
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,900
- Will you hurry up?
- Brian, who do I look like?

425
00:34:46,935 --> 00:34:49,465
One last time: Boris Karloff as the Mummy.

426
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:53,700
- Dead right. Dead ringer, huh?
- One more dead joke, you're dead.

427
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,900
Excuse me, girls.
Y'all know a good dermatologist?

428
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:04,500
- Let's go over it one more time.
- We pick 'em up. You introduce me.

429
00:35:04,535 --> 00:35:07,565
"Miss Gloria Tightass,
little Miss Prim and Proper. "

430
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:12,400
"Good evening, boys. It's swell to meet you. "
I figure she whispers, being from a library.

431
00:35:12,435 --> 00:35:15,800
Right. Good, but talk about books
or something. Keep 'em off guard.

432
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,665
Oh, yeah. Books.

433
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,865
Then we take the detour. You ask me why.

434
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:22,565
- When you hear the word "graveyard"...
- I get hot.

435
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:26,300
Really hot. Be convincing,
because they'll be lookin' for a trap.

436
00:35:26,335 --> 00:35:30,765
- You even gotta convince me.
- Lover, I will be convincing.

437
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:35,700
Oh, I want these guys so horny,
they'll do anything for it. Anything.

438
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:55,700
- What is the matter with you?
- It's the booze, man. It's deadly.

439
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:01,000
Wait a minute. I almost forgot my bottle.

440
00:36:01,035 --> 00:36:03,000
That would be a grave error.

441
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:08,565
So, Gloria,
have you read any good books lately?

442
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:12,100
- I read My Gun is Quick. Do you know it?
- Know it? He lives it.

443
00:36:12,135 --> 00:36:15,417
- Really? Are you a private eye?
- No, he's a private dick.

444
00:36:15,452 --> 00:36:18,665
- But not by choice.
- Turner, how about gobblin' myjoint?

445
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:23,000
- No, I never read that one, Meat.
- Me neither. It's not in the library yet.

446
00:36:23,035 --> 00:36:25,767
How come we've never
seen you at the library?

447
00:36:25,802 --> 00:36:28,465
- She works odd hours.
- Midnight till three.

448
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:32,900
That reminds me. I said I'd stop by the
cemetery to put flowers on Granddad's grave.

449
00:36:32,935 --> 00:36:34,817
The graveyard?

450
00:36:34,852 --> 00:36:36,700
Ooh, Pee Wee!

451
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,100
The worms crawl in

452
00:36:42,135 --> 00:36:43,665
The worms crawl out

453
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:48,800
The worms play pinochle on your snout

454
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:58,065
Hey, don't forget your flowers.

455
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:00,300
- Where are the rednecks?
- Over there.

456
00:37:00,335 --> 00:37:01,965
Where's Steve?

457
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,800
I think we oughta nail him
in his coffin and leave him overnight.

458
00:37:05,835 --> 00:37:09,000
Hey, listen. Listen to me.
I'm gonna go back to her and...

459
00:37:09,035 --> 00:37:11,817
- She's hot, man.
- That's what you said, Pee Wee.

460
00:37:11,852 --> 00:37:14,600
- But she's really hot!
- Pee Wee, I'm getting hot.

461
00:37:14,635 --> 00:37:18,300
I want all you guys - but especially you.

462
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,300
Go get her, Pee Wee.

463
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:25,365
I'm getting hot and I really mean it.

464
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,700
Let's you and I go do it
before the others get there.

465
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,600
Oh, shit!

466
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:36,565
- Bye, Pee Wee.
- Like shootin' fish in a barrel.

467
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:39,900
- Don't die till he gets all his clothes off.
- Right.

468
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,600
- He's going to shit.
- So am I.

469
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,600
Steve!

470
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,365
Shut up, man.

471
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:54,100
Listen, come on! The signal's been delayed.
Somethin' important came up.

472
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:57,300
- Be realistic when you die.
- Don't worry, sugar.

473
00:37:57,335 --> 00:37:58,900
- Go easy, Bill.
- Right.

474
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,500
OK. I'm ready.

475
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,765
Well...

476
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:09,500
I'm dying for it. But wait.

477
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,900
I want you to come... slowly.

478
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:19,465
Step by step... by step.

479
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,900
I wanna feel your arms around me.

480
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:29,400
Your lips on mine. Your hands on my body.

481
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,500
Oh, yes.

482
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,800
Touching, searching, feeling.

483
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:37,000
Oh, Pee Wee!

484
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,600
My God.

485
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,900
What's the matter? Don't you like me?

486
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,300
What?

487
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:07,400
I thought she was supposed
to be doing this realistic.

488
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,400
Holy shit!

489
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,100
Help, Tommy!

490
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,300
Help, Tommy, come here! Hurry!

491
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,700
We've got to act serious.

492
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,700
Tommy!

493
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:27,450
- What happened?
- I don't know.

494
00:39:27,485 --> 00:39:29,765
- Check her pulse.
- What pulse?

495
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,865
- What do you mean, what pulse?
- Is there a heartbeat?

496
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:36,500
- I don't think so.
- Of course there is! Otherwise she'd be...

497
00:39:36,535 --> 00:39:38,300
Dead.

498
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:43,400
Don't look, Pee Wee. Just don't look!

499
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,600
She can't be dead. Let me look.

500
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,600
- Dead as a fuckin' doornail.
- Oh, shit!

501
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,800
You got her too excited, Pee Wee.

502
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:02,800
- I think we should call the police.
- Police?! My mom's gonna kill me.

503
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:06,100
- We can't do that.
- Why not?

504
00:40:06,135 --> 00:40:08,100
- Pee Wee'll go to jail.
- Jail?

505
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:14,100
- What do you mean?
- This is coitus interruptus. In extremis.

506
00:40:14,135 --> 00:40:17,300
- That's a good point.
- But I didn't do anything, Tommy!

507
00:40:17,335 --> 00:40:19,065
The law doesn't look at it that way.

508
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:23,500
If a woman dies while you're boffing her,
you're considered an accomplice.

509
00:40:23,535 --> 00:40:26,265
- Oh, shit, Pee Wee.
- Oh, my God.

510
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:29,100
Look, Pee Wee. It really wasn't your fault.

511
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,465
She probably had a bad heart.

512
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:35,700
- Yeah, it could have happened to any of us.
- Yeah, especially you, Meat.

513
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:42,200
- So. What are we gonna do?
- William, there's only one thing to do.

514
00:40:42,235 --> 00:40:44,200
What's that, Thomas?

515
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,700
Bury her.

516
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,300
Yeah. We've gotta protect Pee Wee.

517
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,800
They might miss her down at the library.

518
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:59,400
I just suppose that's a chance
we're gonna have to take.

519
00:40:59,435 --> 00:41:02,500
- Absolutely right.
- Meat, you wanna grab that body?

520
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:08,300
- Watch your hands.
- What do you care? You're dead.

521
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:12,600
- She's gettin' stiff already.
- So are you, Meat.

522
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,700
- What is this?
- Nothin'.

523
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,800
- "Nothin"'?
- Who's in there?

524
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:45,700
- Nobody.
- "Nobody"?

525
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,865
It's Steve.

526
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:56,265
- It was ajoke.
- Ajoke?

527
00:41:56,300 --> 00:42:01,600
Good God, there's a woman lying dead over
there. And you're telling us it was ajoke?

528
00:42:01,635 --> 00:42:02,965
I didn't know!

529
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,465
We've put up with your pranks
for many years now.

530
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:10,850
But we never dreamed that you'd
have such little regard for human life.

531
00:42:10,885 --> 00:42:15,200
- We're disappointed. Bitterly disappointed.
- Well, God help you, Pee Wee.

532
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:19,300
- You're gonna have to live with this!
- Yeah. Amen.

533
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,800
But...

534
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,800
Oh, shit, Steve.

535
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,600
Goddammit, I'm talkin' to you!

536
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:36,365
What the fuck do you think you're doin'?

537
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:41,200
- It's the goddamn grave robbers again.
- I'm gonna blow their fuckin' heads off.

538
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:45,600
Come on, you guys. What's goin' on?

539
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:48,165
Holy shit!

540
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,900
Bye-bye, Pee Wee. See you later!

541
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,600
What are you guys doin'?

542
00:42:53,635 --> 00:42:55,400
Shit!

543
00:42:56,900 --> 00:43:00,200
- Bye, Pee Wee!
- See you around!

544
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:10,900
- Crazy little fuckers.
- Well, it's an easy ten bucks.

545
00:43:10,935 --> 00:43:12,900
That's right. Hand it over.

546
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,500
- Just kids.
- Yeah.

547
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,700
Remember the last time
we were on this road?

548
00:43:25,735 --> 00:43:27,700
Yeah. Couldn't forget that.

549
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,500
I really wanna hear this story.

550
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:49,700
Look out!

551
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,500
All right. That's it.

552
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,500
OK, OK. All right.

553
00:44:47,535 --> 00:44:49,500
All right, take it up.

554
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,800
This is gonna scare the shit out of 'em.

555
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
They gonna mess their trousers!

556
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:08,250
- Why are we doin' this?
- I don't know, Billy.

557
00:45:08,285 --> 00:45:11,065
- Brian, get the house lights, please.
- Sure.

558
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:15,200
Just pretend Reverend Flavel and
the county commissioners aren't out there.

559
00:45:15,235 --> 00:45:17,967
We'll do the scenes as we've rehearsed them.

560
00:45:18,002 --> 00:45:20,700
Now, don't worry about it. It's going to...

561
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,600
- What is it?
- These clowns.

562
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:39,000
What's this supposed to mean?

563
00:45:39,035 --> 00:45:40,100
Well...

564
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:44,000
They don't like John Henry
playing Romeo to Wendy's Juliet.

565
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:49,800
- I'll withdraw ifyou think it's best.
- Oh, no. We're not givin' in to this stuff.

566
00:45:49,835 --> 00:45:51,800
Hold on a second.

567
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,200
John Henry, certainly we're not going
to be intimidated by this stupidity.

568
00:45:57,235 --> 00:46:00,500
But, ultimately, the decision
isn't ours. It's yours.

569
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,100
Mrs Morris!

570
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:20,100
Oh, Mrs Morris. I'd like you to meet
His Honour Mayor John G Abernathy.

571
00:46:20,135 --> 00:46:23,217
- How do you do?
- How are you? Great school. Great.

572
00:46:23,252 --> 00:46:26,265
- Great school. My mother was a teacher.
- Really?

573
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:30,900
Have you met the other commissioners?
Commissioner Couch. Commissioner Hurley.

574
00:46:30,935 --> 00:46:32,665
- Bob Gebhardt.
- Pleased to meet you.

575
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:36,200
- Well, gentlemen, I hope you enjoy it.
- Not likely.

576
00:46:36,235 --> 00:46:38,365
I always admired the Bard myself.

577
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:42,565
I know several thousand voters
who don't share your view, Commissioner.

578
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:48,200
- That sounds like a threat, Reverend Flavel.
- The Lord doesn't have to threaten.

579
00:46:48,235 --> 00:46:50,165
You remember that, Reverend Flavel.

580
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:53,900
- Well, shall we start?
- Of course, sir.

581
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,500
Call me but love, and I'll be new baptised;

582
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:02,465
Henceforth I never will be Romeo.

583
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:04,400
What man art thou, that,
thus bescreened in night,

584
00:47:04,435 --> 00:47:07,200
So stumblest on my counsel?

585
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:11,500
By a name I know not
how to tell thee who I am:

586
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:17,400
My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
Because it is an enemy to thee.

587
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:20,065
My ears have not yet drunk...

588
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:23,400
- That kid's a Seminole.
- Yeah, probably.

589
00:47:23,435 --> 00:47:26,465
Are thou not Romeo, and a Montague?

590
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:29,865
If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.

591
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:34,800
Or ifthou think'st I be too quickly won,
I'll frown and be perverse and say thee nay.

592
00:47:34,835 --> 00:47:38,400
- Lady, by yonder blessed moon...
- O swear not by the moon...

593
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:43,700
That young man is not
of the American persuasion.

594
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:46,117
My bounty is as boundless as the sea,

595
00:47:46,152 --> 00:47:48,500
My love as deep; the more I give to thee,

596
00:47:48,535 --> 00:47:51,165
The more I have...

597
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,800
Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.

598
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:56,500
Good night, good night!
Parting is such sweet sorrow

599
00:47:56,535 --> 00:47:59,200
That I shall say good night till it be morrow.

600
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:13,565
- Well?
- Didn't we tell you?

601
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:19,465
I want the school board to cut offfunds
for this extravaganza immediately.

602
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:24,600
Well, we're not the school board. The school
board is an independently elected body.

603
00:48:24,635 --> 00:48:27,965
- We'll discuss it. I'll get back to you.
- This is ridiculous!

604
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:33,700
Hell's a lot hotter than Angel Beach,
Mr Carter. You'll get quite a tan.

605
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,800
I wouldn't worry too much about it.

606
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:45,165
- Who's that guy?
- Commissioner Gebhardt. A friend of Dad's.

607
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:49,300
- So what do you think?
- He's great. We got nothin' to worry about.

608
00:48:49,335 --> 00:48:51,900
- You know who's behind this.
- Yeah. Balbricker.

609
00:48:51,935 --> 00:48:54,200
Right. Now she gets hers.

610
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:58,600
Thomas! Hold it, Thomas!

611
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:08,565
- Billy.
- What's this?

612
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:11,500
- Blueprints.
- I know that. What are they of?

613
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:15,100
- Take a look.
- OK. There's the school.

614
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:19,465
OK. So this is the gym. So what?

615
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:23,250
- So we take this snake...
- Jesus Christ! What the hell you doin'?!

616
00:49:23,285 --> 00:49:26,965
- You don't like snakes?
- I hate snakes! You know I hate snakes.

617
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,000
- What are you gonna do? Kill her?
- It's just a rat snake. It's not poisonous.

618
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:30,700
That old black magic has me in its spell

619
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:36,665
That old black magic that you weave so well

620
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:40,800
- Are you sure this is the one, Billy?
- It's that one right there.

621
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:44,800
- You're sure?
- Yeah.

622
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,700
Here we go.

623
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:50,200
Aflame

624
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:53,165
With such a burning desire

625
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:56,500
That only your kiss, kiss, kiss

626
00:50:56,535 --> 00:50:59,100
Can put out the fire

627
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:04,000
- OK, Billy, gimme the snake.
- Give you the snake?

628
00:51:04,035 --> 00:51:06,665
Get your own fuckin' snake.

629
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:10,300
- I've got your snake right here.
- Here.

630
00:51:10,335 --> 00:51:15,217
Oh, you're the lover I have waited for

631
00:51:15,252 --> 00:51:20,976
The mate that fate had me created for

632
00:51:21,011 --> 00:51:26,700
And every time your lips meet mine

633
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,265
Get it outta here!

634
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:34,100
- Put him in the goddamn hole!
- I want you to meet a friend of mine.

635
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,600
OK, come on.

636
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:41,565
In a spin

637
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:44,300
Lovin' that spin I'm in

638
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:50,400
Under that old black magic called...

639
00:51:50,435 --> 00:51:53,965
Love

640
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,800
One more turn and we'll go.

641
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,600
What in the world...?

642
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:39,100
No, it can't be. I fired them.

643
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,300
Excuse me.

644
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,900
It's OK. Nothing to worry about.

645
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:08,300
Just a little rat snake.

646
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:11,100
No danger.

647
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:13,600
No problem, Coach. I'll let him go outside.

648
00:53:13,635 --> 00:53:16,100
Quick thinking, Turner. Good job, son.

649
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:19,400
Turner!

650
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:24,000
Beautiful.

651
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:26,200
- Hang on to that.
- Jesus!

652
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,665
Goddammit!

653
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:31,400
Turner, I'm gonna kill you! Goddammit.

654
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:39,100
That's it. You're not gonna surrender to him.

655
00:53:39,135 --> 00:53:41,500
No Seminole ever surrendered!

656
00:53:41,535 --> 00:53:43,500
Go on! That's it!

657
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:44,865
Go, go!

658
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:46,900
Oh, wait a minute. Wait!

659
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:51,200
That's good acting when you wanna
kill each other, but don't, huh?

660
00:53:51,235 --> 00:53:53,565
I think Hamlet's supposed to win this one.

661
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:55,900
- Sorry, I just got carried away.
- That's OK.

662
00:53:55,935 --> 00:53:57,800
Oh, Mrs Morris.

663
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:02,365
I must have a couple ofwords
with the students.

664
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:06,200
- We're in the middle of a rehearsal.
- It's very important.

665
00:54:06,235 --> 00:54:09,467
All right, folks.
Let's get up here, please. Quickly.

666
00:54:09,502 --> 00:54:12,700
Let's move it.
Folks, may we have your attention?

667
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:16,300
Mr Carter has a few words. Come on, now.

668
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:21,300
Thank you. I don't like to have to say this,
but I don't want you to be too distressed

669
00:54:21,335 --> 00:54:25,367
because I'm quite sure
it can be resolved perfectlyjustly.

670
00:54:25,402 --> 00:54:29,101
As you know, certain uninformed
factions have attempted

671
00:54:29,136 --> 00:54:32,800
to halt our production
of the scenes from Shakespeare.

672
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:37,100
They influenced the county commission
to address the school board,

673
00:54:37,135 --> 00:54:39,365
and they have been granted a hearing.

674
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:42,065
The superintendent of schools
has ordered me

675
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:45,900
to temporarily suspend
this production, pending that hearing.

676
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:49,500
I understand how you feel.
Now, please listen.

677
00:54:49,535 --> 00:54:51,800
That is what I am doing officially.

678
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:56,900
However, there's absolutely nothing
to prevent you on you own

679
00:54:56,935 --> 00:55:00,165
continuing to practice as a class project.

680
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:03,850
<i>I assure you, we're going
to do everything we possibly can</i>

681
00:55:03,885 --> 00:55:07,500
to put this "Evening with
Shakespeare" on the stage.

682
00:55:07,535 --> 00:55:09,900
Thank you, and what's the phrase?

683
00:55:09,935 --> 00:55:11,765
Break a leg!

684
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:14,500
- What a mess.
- Those bastards.

685
00:55:14,535 --> 00:55:15,600
It's ridiculous.

686
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:19,700
The commissioners are closing
Shakespeare because they think it's dirty?

687
00:55:19,735 --> 00:55:23,100
Those creeps watch skin flicks
every Saturday in the courthouse.

688
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:25,965
- You're kidding!
- Commissioner Mason was caught

689
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,400
exposing himselfto his Bible school
class and they hushed it up.

690
00:55:30,435 --> 00:55:33,300
- Oh, God. How did you know that?
- Everybody knows that.

691
00:55:33,335 --> 00:55:35,900
- Well, don't worry about it.
- What do you mean?

692
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:38,100
We got a friend in court, remember?

693
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:41,300
- Yeah, Commissioner...
- Geb-fart.

694
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:44,700
God, I love this. I just love it.

695
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:50,500
I can't tell you how great it makes me feel
to see you great American kids

696
00:55:50,535 --> 00:55:52,165
fighting for what you think is right.

697
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:56,200
And there's no question about
what's right here. This is ridiculous.

698
00:55:56,235 --> 00:55:59,917
- But how can he do this?
- Well, he hasn't done anything yet.

699
00:55:59,952 --> 00:56:03,465
All he's done is petitioned
the school board for a hearing.

700
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:07,100
- But they stopped the play.
- They haven't stopped anything yet.

701
00:56:07,135 --> 00:56:09,400
- You're still rehearsing.
- Yeah...

702
00:56:09,435 --> 00:56:10,365
Right.

703
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:15,800
You don't understand the politics behind this.
This is the way it's gonna work.

704
00:56:15,835 --> 00:56:19,200
As you know, we've got an election
coming up in a couple ofweeks.

705
00:56:19,235 --> 00:56:21,465
Flavel's got a few votes under his thumb,

706
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:24,500
enough to scare a couple
of my fellow commissioners.

707
00:56:24,535 --> 00:56:26,700
So, what's the easy thing to do?

708
00:56:26,735 --> 00:56:29,365
We make Flavel happy. So...

709
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:33,200
So the commission makes Flavel happy
by taking it to the school board.

710
00:56:33,235 --> 00:56:36,367
Right. Now the school board's
not up for reelection,

711
00:56:36,402 --> 00:56:40,001
so they turn the petition
down and you'll be happy.

712
00:56:40,036 --> 00:56:43,600
And the commission is
off the hook because... we tried.

713
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:48,600
So how'd you get
the commissioners to go along?

714
00:56:48,635 --> 00:56:50,600
Old-fashioned horse trading.

715
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:55,700
Some fellow commissioners have a rezoning
project on the line, and I'm the swing vote.

716
00:56:55,735 --> 00:57:00,700
I really don't give a damn ifthey get
their rezoning - but I can't let them know that.

717
00:57:00,735 --> 00:57:03,100
So I play hardball.

718
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:06,165
If they want my swing vote,
they have to help me.

719
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:10,600
It's like the hip bone connected to the
thigh bone, thigh bone to the ankle bone...

720
00:57:10,635 --> 00:57:15,400
- It sounds like dirty pool to me.
- Well...

721
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:20,065
Well, now, little fella. Our great
American system is built on compromise.

722
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:24,400
Everybody wants something. The trick is
to see that everybody gets a little piece.

723
00:57:24,435 --> 00:57:26,800
- You know what I mean?
- You bet he does.

724
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:30,700
Now, you've got my word on this.

725
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:35,300
I'm not gonna let some self-righteous
bullies deprive you ofyour play.

726
00:57:35,335 --> 00:57:38,100
Your principal is being notified right now

727
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:43,400
that the school board has okayed
the evening of Shakespeare.

728
00:57:43,435 --> 00:57:46,200
That's wonderful. Thank you very much.

729
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:50,300
Well, you gotta do somethin'
for the little guy.

730
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:54,000
Oh, Commissioner.
Your meeting in five minutes.

731
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:58,200
You kids go put on a hell of a play.

732
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:01,300
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

733
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:05,600
- Maybe I'll get invited to the opening night?
- Front row, center.

734
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:13,700
- Great guy.
- Yeah, he's swell!

735
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,765
What's that?

736
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:25,600
Reverend Flavel's petition
to stop the Shakespeare festival.

737
00:58:25,635 --> 00:58:28,100
- Five thousand signatures.
- Five thousand?

738
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:34,100
Yeah, and every one ofthem prepared to
vote against you ifthings don't go their way.

739
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:39,100
Set up a meeting with Flavel.

740
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,665
Right.

741
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:43,800
I thought so.

742
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:52,900
The Klan!

743
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,800
- What's goin' on? What happened?
- There's no need for you now.

744
00:59:03,835 --> 00:59:06,465
- Wait a minute. We're his friends.
- I'm his brother.

745
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:10,365
- You should have been here on time.
- My truck wouldn't start.

746
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:14,700
John's always waited for us to get here
before he came out to the road.

747
00:59:14,735 --> 00:59:18,400
Leave him alone. It was John's mistake.

748
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:24,500
- How badly is he hurt?
- Just his pride.

749
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:27,200
They tried to shave his head.

750
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:31,100
A white man's little joke.
But their day is coming.

751
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:35,065
Whoa, buddy.

752
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:37,600
Are you all right? You're sure, John?

753
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:42,700
- I wanna go.
- Let him go.

754
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:45,400
All right, go.

755
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:49,600
- That oughta stir 'em up.
- Yeah, they oughta turn tail now.

756
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:56,300
Look at them dirty redskins
attacking that poor, defenseless cross.

757
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:04,100
I will not yield,

758
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:07,700
To kiss the ground
beneath young Malcolm's feet.

759
01:00:07,735 --> 01:00:10,567
Though Birnam wood
be come to Dunsinane,

760
01:00:10,602 --> 01:00:13,400
And thou opposed,
being of no woman born,

761
01:00:13,435 --> 01:00:15,400
Yet I will try the last.

762
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:17,900
Lay on, Macduff.

763
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:25,900
And damned be he
that first cries "Hold, enough!"

764
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:02,800
- My sword broke.
- His sword broke!

765
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:05,600
- A sword!
- A sword!

766
01:01:05,635 --> 01:01:08,300
His kingdom for a sword!

767
01:01:08,335 --> 01:01:11,100
Get him a sword!

768
01:01:11,135 --> 01:01:12,900
A sword!

769
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:17,900
- I don't have a sword.
- What do you mean?

770
01:01:17,935 --> 01:01:21,600
- Just kill him.
- With what?

771
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:35,800
Billy, I got a sword.

772
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:12,800
Stab him.

773
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:20,300
Just kill me, John.

774
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:23,800
Aw, shit!

775
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:27,800
Stab!

776
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:30,700
Will you stab me? Just stick it in, John!

777
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:14,150
Now the hungry lion roars,
And the wolf behowls the moon;

778
01:03:14,185 --> 01:03:19,000
As this heavy ploughman snores,
All the weary task fordone.

779
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:23,665
Now the wasted brands do glow,

780
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:26,765
Whilst the screech owl, screeching loud,

781
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:30,200
Does put the wretch that lies in woe
To the remembrance of a shroud.

782
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:40,200
Flock! Follow.

783
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:46,465
Not a mouse
Shall disturb this hallowed house:

784
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:50,900
For I am sent with broom before,
To sweep the dust behind the door.

785
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:07,400
If we have unearned luck
So to 'scape the serpent's tongue,

786
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:11,400
We will make amends ere long;
Or else Puck...

787
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:25,100
- It's the cops!
- Whoa, what's this? What's goin' on here?

788
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:30,300
I am the principal and I will take care ofthis.

789
01:04:30,335 --> 01:04:32,765
Ladies and gentlemen, one moment, please.

790
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:36,665
These learned people, the Righteous Flock,
in their infinite wisdom,

791
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:42,400
have decreed that the works ofWilliam
Shakespeare, the pearl of English literature,

792
01:04:42,435 --> 01:04:48,100
are unfit to be performed by our students
and too indecent to be viewed by you.

793
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:53,700
However, my good friends, I assure you:

794
01:04:53,735 --> 01:04:55,900
we have not yet begun to fight.

795
01:04:57,700 --> 01:04:59,700
Thank you.

796
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:04,965
Good night,

797
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:08,300
and we'll see you all again... very soon.

798
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:17,600
- Who do you think you're talkin' to?
- A hypocrite.

799
01:05:17,635 --> 01:05:19,865
You care nothing about matters ofthe spirit.

800
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:23,000
You just wanna control
other people's lives, you fascist!

801
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:28,000
We have dealt with the filth. I can see we will
now have to deal with the purveyors offilth.

802
01:05:28,035 --> 01:05:31,465
- Hey, deal with this.
- You whelp of Satan!

803
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:35,600
No one speaks to me that way.
You better get a grip on yourself, boy.

804
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:45,465
Bye, Reverend.

805
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:48,600
Anthony, that wasn't entirely helpful.

806
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:54,400
Now, as I say, we have a warrant here

807
01:05:54,435 --> 01:05:57,165
charging the Angel Beach High drama club

808
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:01,100
with public presentation
of obscene material.

809
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:06,500
Of course, we have no need to press
this warrant. That was never our intent.

810
01:06:06,535 --> 01:06:08,965
These innocent children aren't to blame.

811
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,300
- Do you believe this guy?
- He's a deeply religious man!

812
01:06:12,335 --> 01:06:14,400
Yeah, and rich.

813
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:18,200
We were the voice cryin' in the wilderness.

814
01:06:18,235 --> 01:06:21,065
And we were heard by the mayor

815
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:26,100
and the God-fearin' members ofthe county
commission, who voted unanimously

816
01:06:26,135 --> 01:06:28,665
to bring this corruption to a halt.

817
01:06:28,700 --> 01:06:32,050
Does your warrant
apply to all plays by the drama club?

818
01:06:32,085 --> 01:06:35,400
My warrant applies
to all plays by any drama club...

819
01:06:35,435 --> 01:06:37,365
That lousy son of a bitch.

820
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:40,600
Gebhardt's leg bone got connected
to Flavel's foot bone.

821
01:06:40,635 --> 01:06:43,800
And they both got shoved up our asses.
I knew it.

822
01:06:43,835 --> 01:06:46,265
Fellow Americans! Fellow Americans...

823
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:49,700
The Righteous Flock denounces you.
You have no part in this.

824
01:06:49,735 --> 01:06:53,100
The God-fearin' members
of the Klan support this action.

825
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:57,700
The mixin' of nigger
and Injun blood must stop.

826
01:06:57,735 --> 01:07:00,400
- God, I think I'm gonna puke.
- Me too.

827
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:02,900
Go on, get out of here!

828
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:07,665
- The Righteous Flock denounces this...
- Sister, please!

829
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:13,900
Friends, tomorrow night there will be
a giant rally here at Angel Beach

830
01:07:13,935 --> 01:07:18,700
to announce future steps
we will take to preserve moral decency.

831
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:21,765
Amen! Amen, brother!

832
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:24,600
The Loyal Order ofthe Klan will be there!

833
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:29,700
- Here comes the son of a bitch.
- Pretend you understand why he did it.

834
01:07:29,735 --> 01:07:33,317
- What are you talkin' about?
- Just do it! I'll explain later.

835
01:07:33,352 --> 01:07:36,900
- This is exhausting!
- All tuckered out from playin' hardball?

836
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:42,900
I was afraid you were gonna misunderstand.
I had to make a tactical retreat.

837
01:07:42,935 --> 01:07:45,800
If I'd hung in there,
you'd have no friend in court.

838
01:07:46,100 --> 01:07:49,000
Friend in court? Gee, that has a familiar ring.

839
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:51,265
I said "retreat," not "surrender. "

840
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:54,600
He's a fanatic. Give him two weeks,
he's gonna bury himself.

841
01:07:54,635 --> 01:07:57,065
- Right after the election, hm?
- Yeah.

842
01:07:57,100 --> 01:08:01,150
Apparently you don't believe me,
but I was working in your best interests.

843
01:08:01,185 --> 01:08:05,200
Look, votes don't mean a thing to me
if I can't maintain my own integrity.

844
01:08:05,235 --> 01:08:07,800
Look, we understand.
It's not the end ofthe world.

845
01:08:07,835 --> 01:08:10,400
Everybody's just a little disappointed.

846
01:08:10,435 --> 01:08:12,465
I know. I understand.

847
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:16,900
Wendy, let me talk to you. I want to
explain what it is I'm trying to accomplish,

848
01:08:16,935 --> 01:08:20,400
- then you can relay it to the fellas. OK?
- OK.

849
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:23,765
I know what he's trying to accomplish.

850
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:27,500
Mrs Balbricker, be silent!
I have spoken on this matter.

851
01:08:27,535 --> 01:08:30,300
What is at stake justifies
anything we have to do.

852
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:34,200
Well, then, I won't be there. It's indecent.

853
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:38,200
Remember, he who is not
with me is against me.

854
01:08:38,235 --> 01:08:40,200
Bubba!

855
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:44,000
Tell us, Reverend.

856
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:48,800
Friends, it's OK. It's all right.
Don't forget tomorrow night.

857
01:08:55,100 --> 01:08:58,400
- This is more fun than puttin' on a play.
- Bite your tongue.

858
01:08:58,435 --> 01:09:01,100
OK, guys. What are we gonna do?

859
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:06,200
Well, I think for once we should
be thoughtful, mature and adult.

860
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:08,800
No, no. Tommy's right.

861
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:13,300
We got a problem. It's time we grew up
and we solved it in an adult manner.

862
01:09:13,335 --> 01:09:15,165
Right. Let's go right to the top.

863
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:20,300
What would Eisenhower do ifthe Russians
behaved as the Righteous Flock has?

864
01:09:20,335 --> 01:09:23,717
- Cut the fuckers' nuts off.
- Right.

865
01:09:23,752 --> 01:09:27,100
- Any more questions?
- Not a one.

866
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:30,700
- Let's get backstage for battle plans.
- Yeah.

867
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:36,565
- And him too!
- I don't like him.

868
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:39,600
- What did he have to say?
- Nothing much.

869
01:09:39,635 --> 01:09:42,500
- He's takin' me to dinner.
- Dinner?

870
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:46,200
He's takin' me to a nice,
discreet restaurant down in Miami.

871
01:09:46,235 --> 01:09:49,865
- What are you up to?
- Revenge. What are you up to?

872
01:09:49,900 --> 01:09:53,600
- Sounds good to me.
- Yeah, but this time no explosives.

873
01:09:53,635 --> 01:09:55,900
- I don't get it.
- Nobody tells me nothin'.

874
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Commissioner. Commissioner,
you're takin' that kid to dinner?

875
01:10:00,035 --> 01:10:02,465
Just gonna put another notch
in my six-shooter.

876
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:05,400
For God's sake, we have
an election in just over a week.

877
01:10:05,435 --> 01:10:08,300
Don't worry.
I'm takin' her all the way to Miami.

878
01:10:08,335 --> 01:10:11,065
But, Commissioner, she is only 17 years old.

879
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:14,100
Oh, yeah? Then I'll only put
half a notch in my gun.

880
01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:48,400
- I hope this is better than the last one.
- At least we can see this one.

881
01:10:48,435 --> 01:10:50,665
Wow! Look at that fancy costume!

882
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:54,450
That guy's wearing argyle socks.
Must be a high-budgetjob.

883
01:10:54,485 --> 01:10:58,200
This director must be
the Cecil B De Mille of pussy film.

884
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,065
Man, that woman is ugly.

885
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:03,300
Hose her down, boy! Hose her down.

886
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:06,800
Look at them tits.

887
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:11,000
Holy shit!
Look at the dick on that son of a bitch!

888
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:15,500
Mayor, that guy's dork is bigger than yours.

889
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:21,500
Hey, mayor! Ifyou had a cape like that,
you could give your secretary a flyin' fuck.

890
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:25,065
Look at thatsnatch!

891
01:11:25,100 --> 01:11:28,065
Did ReverendFlavelapprove ofthis one?

892
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:31,600
Approve ofit?
Are you shittin'me? He gave me this one!

893
01:11:34,900 --> 01:11:37,100
That stuff looks like diarrhea.

894
01:11:37,135 --> 01:11:39,200
Only worse.

895
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:44,700
And now for the grand experiment.

896
01:11:44,735 --> 01:11:46,800
Oh, no.

897
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:50,500
Wait a minute.
As you know, I am the barf inspector.

898
01:11:50,535 --> 01:11:53,517
I gotta make sure
it has exactly the right plop.

899
01:11:53,552 --> 01:11:56,500
Barf inspector comin' through!
Excuse me. Careful.

900
01:11:56,600 --> 01:12:00,500
- This couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
- X marks the spot. Let her rip!

901
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:08,500
- Right in the eye. OK, more corn.
- Corn. Corn.

902
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:26,550
Please, madame.
At La Fontana di Voglio, everyone waits.

903
01:12:26,585 --> 01:12:30,500
Please, to the back ofthe line.
Merci, thank you very much.

904
01:12:30,535 --> 01:12:32,617
- Ah, Monsieur Gebhardt.
- Alex.

905
01:12:32,652 --> 01:12:34,700
How good to see you, monsieur.

906
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:38,400
We are expecting a guest
this evening, I presume?

907
01:12:38,435 --> 01:12:40,365
You presume correctly.

908
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:44,465
And at what time is your sister arriving?
Or is it your cousin this time?

909
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:50,600
- Actually, this one's more like my niece.
- But of course, monsieur. Of course.

910
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:19,265
<i>- Is everything all set?
- All set.</i>

911
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:21,600
- This is gonna be good.
- Go get 'em, Billy.

912
01:13:21,635 --> 01:13:23,765
- Is my hood on straight?
- Can you see?

913
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:27,300
- Yeah.
- Then your hood's on straight, stupid!

914
01:13:27,335 --> 01:13:29,465
Everybody's a fuckin' comedian.

915
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:32,700
- They oughta be here soon.
- I'm goin' down the road.

916
01:13:32,735 --> 01:13:34,800
You be careful!

917
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:54,600
Where the hell are they? They sh...

918
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:57,300
OK, guys, be careful.

919
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:01,800
Where's Mickey?

920
01:14:05,700 --> 01:14:08,000
Where the hell is he?

921
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:12,765
- Hey, you Klan pricks!
- OK, guys. Let's go.

922
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:17,700
Yeah, you. Why don't you boys go on home
and choke your chicken and beat your kids?

923
01:14:17,735 --> 01:14:19,965
That's your speed.

924
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,765
Excuse me. Have you met my friend Meat?

925
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:28,100
Go screw your wives! You'll have to wake 'em
up and tell 'em what you're doin', though.

926
01:14:28,135 --> 01:14:32,000
Forget him. Let's get to the meetin'.

927
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:47,000
Hey, where you goin'? The rally's this way.

928
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:51,400
Shortcut.

929
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:06,600
What the hell is goin' on here?

930
01:15:12,900 --> 01:15:15,065
Evenin', boys.

931
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:17,200
- Howdy.
- Welcome, fellas.

932
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:20,300
We thought you might like to meet our friend.

933
01:15:20,335 --> 01:15:22,700
Say what?

934
01:15:25,300 --> 01:15:28,065
Yeah, I remember him.

935
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:31,600
You did a mighty fine job on him, Eustace!

936
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:35,500
The stingy little fucker wouldn't leave no tip.

937
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:40,400
Well, now, in lieu of a tip,
why don't we just return the favor?

938
01:15:40,700 --> 01:15:43,465
Louisville tit? What did he say?

939
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:46,800
- What did you say, boy?
- Why don't we give you a trim?

940
01:15:46,835 --> 01:15:50,200
Oh, you snotnoses are gonna give us a trim?

941
01:15:53,900 --> 01:15:57,300
- Us and a few of our friends.
- A few ofthese friends here.

942
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:06,700
Well, you better bring the army, boy.
Bring the whole fuckin' US cavalry.

943
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:10,000
Actually, we had something
slightly different in mind.

944
01:16:10,035 --> 01:16:12,100
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

945
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:21,000
Aw, shit! They're all fuckin' Indians.

946
01:16:23,900 --> 01:16:27,300
Aw, shit. Oh, that's a lot of Injuns.

947
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:33,500
They ain't happy. These Injuns ain't happy.

948
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,600
Well, now. Don't be shy.

949
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:39,100
Excuse me.

950
01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:41,665
Hi.

951
01:16:41,700 --> 01:16:43,865
In view ofyour status in the community,

952
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:47,300
we've imported a special
gentleman to give you your clip.

953
01:16:47,335 --> 01:16:49,800
- Allow me.
- I'd like you to meet Brian Schwartz.

954
01:16:49,835 --> 01:16:51,865
He's Jewish. He's our mohelfor the day.

955
01:16:51,900 --> 01:16:56,200
What, you may ask, is a mohel?
Good question. A mohel is a Jewish barber.

956
01:16:56,700 --> 01:16:59,600
- But not exactly.
- Ask him what a mohel is exactly.

957
01:16:59,635 --> 01:17:02,665
- Come on!
- Go on, ask him.

958
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:05,700
- What in hell's a mohel?
- I thought you would never ask.

959
01:17:05,735 --> 01:17:08,465
Do you remember when you had your bris?

960
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:11,365
Probably a barbecue and a bris in your case.

961
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:14,200
- Go on, ask him what a bris is.
- What in the fuck is a bris?

962
01:17:14,235 --> 01:17:17,165
Good question.
Well, a bris is a circumcision,

963
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:20,500
and a mohel is a man
who performs a bris or circumcision.

964
01:17:20,535 --> 01:17:24,000
And this instrument is a zemel.

965
01:17:24,300 --> 01:17:28,500
And a zemel is used
by a mohelto perform the bris.

966
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:32,300
- Would you hold that?
- Absolutely.

967
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:37,200
Now, this zemel has been used to chop
off literally hundreds offoreskins.

968
01:17:37,235 --> 01:17:38,765
- Hundreds.
- Amen.

969
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:42,300
What better to shave the heads
of a bunch of pricks like you?

970
01:17:43,100 --> 01:17:46,600
- The fuck you will!
- That's it.

971
01:17:54,700 --> 01:17:57,500
Sit down, Ansell. Sit down.

972
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:02,800
Line up, boys.

973
01:18:02,900 --> 01:18:05,665
Say, now. This is gettin'
out of hand here, boys.

974
01:18:05,700 --> 01:18:08,900
Let's talk this over, OK?
I tell you what we're gonna do.

975
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:12,165
We're gonna let you offthis time, OK?

976
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:16,600
You're gonna get out of here and we don't
wanna see you around here no more.

977
01:18:16,635 --> 01:18:19,100
- That a deal?
- Yeah, now that's fair, ain't it?

978
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:21,300
You gotta admit, that is fair.

979
01:18:21,900 --> 01:18:23,900
Nah.

980
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,365
Line up, boys.

981
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:30,000
We'll most certainly have
to retire this zemelafter this job.

982
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:05,500
- Madame, we'll wait.
- That will be grand.

983
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:23,000
You sly devil. I just can't stand it.

984
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:26,500
I'll have you know
I'm the guest of Big Bobby Gebhardt,

985
01:19:26,535 --> 01:19:29,265
County Commissioner of Seward County.

986
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:32,800
- You better take me to his table pronto.
- What is the problem?

987
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:36,465
I happen to be the guest
of Big Bob Gebhardt,

988
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:40,300
County Commissioner
of Seward County, and a very big deal.

989
01:19:40,335 --> 01:19:42,900
You better take me to his table pronto.

990
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:47,300
- Are you sure it's Commissioner Gebhardt?
- Move it, dildo breath!

991
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:52,000
Giddyup! Whoa, what an ass!

992
01:19:54,700 --> 01:19:58,465
Bobby! Oh, Bobby!

993
01:19:58,500 --> 01:20:02,400
Little Bobby Gebhardt, where are you?

994
01:20:02,700 --> 01:20:06,900
It's your little snatchy-poo!

995
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:11,900
What are you waitin' around for?
Roll 'em out! Git along, little dogies.

996
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:15,300
We're here, jackass!

997
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:20,400
Bobby. Baby.

998
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:24,900
Oh, my God.

999
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:35,750
What are you doin'? Are you crazy?

1000
01:20:35,785 --> 01:20:38,300
I'm crazy for you, you big horse.

1001
01:20:38,335 --> 01:20:40,300
I want a drink. Gar-con!

1002
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:44,400
Gar-con! What's the matter?
Don't you speak French?

1003
01:20:44,435 --> 01:20:45,665
Yeah. Oui, oui.

1004
01:20:45,700 --> 01:20:50,300
Well, get me a drink. It's my birthday today.

1005
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:52,600
I'm 17 today.

1006
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:56,000
Golly, 17!

1007
01:20:56,100 --> 01:20:57,800
Don't say 17.

1008
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:01,000
Sweet 17 and never been kissed.

1009
01:21:02,300 --> 01:21:04,700
That kid is 23. 20.

1010
01:21:04,735 --> 01:21:07,065
Where does the time go?

1011
01:21:07,100 --> 01:21:12,000
Why, do you realize
I was only 14 when we first met?

1012
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:15,200
I don't know her. Isn't this crazy?

1013
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:21,000
It was so romantic. I was a Brownie
in his wife's Girl Scout troop.

1014
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:24,800
- You swine!
- Gimme a Shirley Temple.

1015
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:32,165
It's my niece. She does it all the time.

1016
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:35,500
You should have seen her
last year at the Elks Club.

1017
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:40,900
Hey, what are you doin' with my boa?
Are you some kind of sickie? Pervert!

1018
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:45,665
Very cute. Well, I'm leaving.

1019
01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:48,000
Get out ofthat chair and I'll yell "rape. "

1020
01:21:48,035 --> 01:21:50,200
- You'll what?
- I'll yell "rape. "

1021
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,100
You're bluffing.

1022
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:03,600
Oh, Bobby, don't leave me.
I can't have our baby alone.

1023
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:11,400
My daughter's so funny. She's just wild.

1024
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:16,700
How's that grab you?
Now sit there and take your medicine.

1025
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:19,300
She never stops. She's so wicked.

1026
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:24,800
Yes, that's it. That's right, brother.

1027
01:22:24,835 --> 01:22:28,367
Let's all stand up for Jesus.

1028
01:22:28,402 --> 01:22:32,051
Till every foe is vanquished

1029
01:22:32,086 --> 01:22:36,093
And Christ is Lord indeed

1030
01:22:36,128 --> 01:22:40,100
Stand up, stand up for Jesus

1031
01:22:40,135 --> 01:22:44,217
Ye soldiers ofthe cross

1032
01:22:44,252 --> 01:22:48,426
Lift high his royal banner

1033
01:22:48,461 --> 01:22:52,730
It must not suffer loss

1034
01:22:52,765 --> 01:22:56,932
From victory unto victory

1035
01:22:56,967 --> 01:23:01,065
His army shall he lead

1036
01:23:01,100 --> 01:23:05,600
Till every foe is vanquished

1037
01:23:05,700 --> 01:23:10,265
And Christ is Lord indeed

1038
01:23:10,300 --> 01:23:14,400
Thank you, brothers,
for that inspirational hymn about Jesus.

1039
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:17,700
And now, friends, as I was say...

1040
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:28,000
As I was sayin'...

1041
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:41,200
Good Lord.

1042
01:23:45,900 --> 01:23:48,200
- Is this part ofthe show?
- I don't know.

1043
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:58,200
- What a bunch of assholes.
- Do you recognize any ofthem?

1044
01:23:58,235 --> 01:24:01,200
Hold it! Hold, I say.

1045
01:24:01,235 --> 01:24:03,300
Stand, I say.

1046
01:24:04,100 --> 01:24:08,500
Behold, the spawn of Satan.

1047
01:24:09,300 --> 01:24:12,400
The bowels of perdition.

1048
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:18,000
- Hear my words. I speak salvation.
- Right, get ready.

1049
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:21,000
- I speak redemption.
- Now!

1050
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,765
Verily I say this to thee.

1051
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:29,200
Holy shit!
Look at the dick on thatson ofa bitch!

1052
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:37,800
Mayor, thatguy's dork is bigger than yours.

1053
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:44,700
Hey, mayor!Ifyou hada cape like that,
you couldgive yoursecretarya flyin'fuck.

1054
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:49,400
- Look at thatsnatch!
- Oh, mother.

1055
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:56,500
- DidReverendFlavelapprove ofthis one?
- You scum!

1056
01:24:56,535 --> 01:25:00,600
Approve?
Hell, ReverendFlavelgave me this one!

1057
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:03,800
I can explain it to you. Let me tell you.

1058
01:25:08,900 --> 01:25:12,300
It's all right. I swear it's gonna be OK.

1059
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:15,800
It's the goddamn communist...

1060
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:22,600
Those sons of bitches...
You son of a bitch! You get out of here.

1061
01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:27,200
I told you to get out!
I tell ya, it's gonna be OK.

1062
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:30,400
Aw, shit!

1063
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:57,600
God, I needed that.

1064
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:03,365
Oh, don't worry.
Commissioner Gebhardt'll pay for it.

1065
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:06,600
He's county commissioner
of Seward County, for piss sakes.

1066
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:12,600
You don't think he's gonna stick ya
for a 50-cent drink, for piss sakes?

1067
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:15,700
Hey, waiter!

1068
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:25,400
Put shitface's drink here
on Commissioner Gebhardt's bill.

1069
01:26:26,100 --> 01:26:29,200
For piss sakes, he's up
for reelection in two weeks.

1070
01:26:29,235 --> 01:26:31,500
Do you think he needs this shit?

1071
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:37,900
- She's crazy.
- Your ass sucks canal water, buddy.

1072
01:26:39,700 --> 01:26:43,500
Oh, there's my Shirley Temple.

1073
01:26:43,535 --> 01:26:46,200
Hey, where's my cherry?

1074
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:48,900
Who got my cherry?

1075
01:26:49,300 --> 01:26:51,300
Bobby.

1076
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,800
Bobby, I lost my cherry.

1077
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:02,165
Bobby,

1078
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:05,800
did you get my cherry again?

1079
01:27:05,835 --> 01:27:08,165
You saucy little devil.

1080
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:11,500
You can't get a girl's cherry twice.

1081
01:27:11,535 --> 01:27:14,000
You sly goose.

1082
01:27:29,900 --> 01:27:32,400
Oh, my God.

1083
01:27:39,900 --> 01:27:42,400
Oh, Bobby.

1084
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:46,800
Bobby, I think I'm gonna be... sick.

1085
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,100
Don't be sick.

1086
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:52,900
Bobby, I am. I'm gonna be...

1087
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:58,900
Not the pool. No, not the pool.

1088
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:14,500
Back to Howard Johnson's.

1089
01:28:50,100 --> 01:28:52,900
Boy, it sure tastes better goin' down.

1090
01:28:54,900 --> 01:28:57,400
Well, I feel better now.

1091
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:00,600
Bye.

1092
01:29:00,900 --> 01:29:03,000
Oh, my bag.

1093
01:29:05,900 --> 01:29:08,300
Well, farewell!

1094
01:29:11,100 --> 01:29:13,200
Ben, what's goin' on?

1095
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:19,800
I will sue you!
You will not have a pot to piss in!

1096
01:29:19,835 --> 01:29:21,800
Look!

1097
01:29:29,300 --> 01:29:33,365
My tit! You broke my tit!

1098
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:36,900
I'm gonna sue you! Where are my lawyers?

1099
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:42,600
- Come on, boys. Pictures! I want pictures!
- Say "I'm ruined. "

1100
01:29:42,700 --> 01:29:46,700
- Oh, shit.
- Another one. More pictures. This is nice.

1101
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:55,250
Good luck in the election.
I'll see you at the polls.

1102
01:29:55,285 --> 01:29:58,300
This is the most disgusting display
I have ever seen.

1103
01:29:58,335 --> 01:30:00,800
What a dump! We're leaving.

1104
01:30:03,100 --> 01:30:05,250
We're offto see the Wizard

1105
01:30:05,285 --> 01:30:07,192
The wonderful Wizard of Oz

1106
01:30:07,227 --> 01:30:09,065
Because, because, because

1107
01:30:09,100 --> 01:30:11,000
Because ofthe wonderful things he does

1108
01:30:11,035 --> 01:30:12,000
We're offto see the Wizard...

1109
01:31:29,700 --> 01:31:34,300
- Good luck in the election, Commissioner.
- Let me discuss the issues with you.

1110
01:31:34,335 --> 01:31:37,100
- Commissioner Couch. Republican.
- Yeah.

1111
01:31:37,135 --> 01:31:38,900
Good luck in the elections.

1112
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:43,700
Wait! Wait, don't go. Stop!

1113
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:47,100
Don't go. Wait!

1114
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:49,300
Stop!

1115
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
April Fool!

1116
01:32:14,500 --> 01:32:19,700
What the hell are you hittin' me for?
Lady, I'm warnin' you. Don't hit me no more...

1117
01:32:22,200 --> 01:32:24,300
Well, I warned you.

1118
01:32:24,700 --> 01:32:29,200
Don't just lie there all spread-eagled
like that. It looks obscene.

1119
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:04,100
You are a disgrace to the profession.

1120
01:33:04,135 --> 01:33:06,600
You are... je ne sais quoi...

1121
01:33:06,635 --> 01:33:08,365
relieved of duty.

1122
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:13,100
I am the new mat re de La Fontana di Voglio.
