1
00:03:13,577 --> 00:03:17,414
Attila! Where are you, boy?
Did you get that rabbit?

2
00:03:17,539 --> 00:03:21,126
Did ya? l bet you did.
My mighty hunter.

3
00:03:21,251 --> 00:03:24,421
You vicious killer.
That's my dog.

4
00:03:24,546 --> 00:03:26,340
That's my beast.

5
00:03:26,465 --> 00:03:28,258
Come on. Gimme a kiss.

6
00:03:40,145 --> 00:03:44,358
Wait a minute.
Wait a damn minute.

7
00:03:44,483 --> 00:03:47,820
Attila!
And you call yourself security?

8
00:03:52,741 --> 00:03:55,160
Don't change the subject.

9
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,711
Love child
Love child

10
00:04:03,836 --> 00:04:06,922
Hey, George.
Born of poverty

11
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:09,300
You gonna just stand there,
or you gonna help me with these boxes?

12
00:04:09,425 --> 00:04:12,344
Now whattaya
got me carryin', huh?

13
00:04:12,469 --> 00:04:15,055
l got a deal on solar panels
and batteries.

14
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,267
Well, l told you l wasn't doing
any more improvements on the house.

15
00:04:18,392 --> 00:04:20,144
l'm sellin' this place someday.

16
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:21,729
Yeah, right.

17
00:04:21,854 --> 00:04:23,355
But l see you improved
the garden anyway.

18
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,774
Yeah, and that goddam rabbit
still got in there.

19
00:04:28,027 --> 00:04:30,654
l told you. He went
under your fence, George.

20
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:32,156
- He did not.
- He did too.

21
00:04:32,281 --> 00:04:36,702
Look, l put that fence a foot
and a half underneath the ground.

22
00:04:36,827 --> 00:04:39,121
Well, it's a mystery, George.

23
00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:41,707
Anyway, this solar outfit...

24
00:04:41,832 --> 00:04:43,959
is gonna save you money,
and it's free.

25
00:04:45,961 --> 00:04:47,796
So, happy birthday.

26
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:50,674
Thanks, Nate. Thank you.

27
00:04:54,386 --> 00:04:56,889
Who's gonna
put it together? Huh?

28
00:04:57,014 --> 00:04:58,932
Not me.

29
00:04:59,058 --> 00:05:00,809
lt comes with a manual
in three different languages.

30
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:04,104
- Forget it.
- Look, if it's a car, l can fix it.

31
00:05:04,229 --> 00:05:06,065
lt's in the garden,
l probably can grow it, but--

32
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:10,653
This is way out
of my neighbourhood.

33
00:05:10,778 --> 00:05:13,656
Hey, you, uh,
you bringin' a date tonight?

34
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:16,367
No. You?

35
00:05:16,492 --> 00:05:18,494
Well, l'm thinkin'
of askin' somebody.

36
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:21,330
When? Today?

37
00:05:21,455 --> 00:05:22,790
You don't give 'em
much notice, do ya?

38
00:05:22,915 --> 00:05:25,125
Well, you even
ask anybody? Huh?

39
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:29,088
Always ask Diana Ross,
but she never says yes to me.

40
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:33,467
- See ya.
- See ya later.

41
00:05:33,592 --> 00:05:36,887
But you're never, ever
gonna return

42
00:05:37,012 --> 00:05:40,516
To ease the fire
that within me burns

43
00:05:40,641 --> 00:05:44,311
lt keeps me cryin', baby,
for you

44
00:05:44,436 --> 00:05:48,023
Keeps me sighin', baby, for you

45
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:53,529
So won't you hurry
Come on, boy, see about me

46
00:05:53,654 --> 00:05:55,698
- Come see about me
- Hey, Bill!

47
00:05:55,823 --> 00:05:58,909
See about your baby
Come see about me

48
00:05:59,034 --> 00:06:01,245
Hey, George. George!
l forgot to tell you, man.

49
00:06:03,122 --> 00:06:06,041
Hold on. Hold on.

50
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,960
Doctor called.

51
00:06:08,085 --> 00:06:10,212
Banes, will you
let me figure it out?

52
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:16,218
At 10-- At 10:00. At 10:00.

53
00:06:21,557 --> 00:06:24,727
He want you que vayas
a su ventana at 10:00.

54
00:06:29,773 --> 00:06:32,234
- He wants you to look at his window.
- Oh, man!

55
00:06:41,702 --> 00:06:45,664
How ya doin', Lace?
You look great.

56
00:06:45,789 --> 00:06:48,417
Yeah. How are
the chairs sellin'?

57
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:50,461
l got one left.
l need four more.

58
00:06:52,254 --> 00:06:55,549
Wow. lt's going a lot better
than l expected.

59
00:06:55,674 --> 00:06:57,843
Yeah, well, you know,
people sit down a lot around here.

60
00:06:57,968 --> 00:06:59,053
Yeah.

61
00:06:59,178 --> 00:07:01,472
- Here, l can get these.
- No, l got it. Thanks.

62
00:07:01,597 --> 00:07:03,807
Well--

63
00:07:03,932 --> 00:07:05,017
l'll help ya.

64
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:09,772
Hey, uh, Lace-- There's a-- There's
a party tonight at the Elkhorn Bar.

65
00:07:09,897 --> 00:07:12,232
Why do they call it that?
There's no elk around here.

66
00:07:12,358 --> 00:07:14,360
Well, l don't know. They've just
always called it the Elkhorn.

67
00:07:14,485 --> 00:07:17,029
Why? They got some poor
elk's horn hanging over the bar?

68
00:07:17,154 --> 00:07:19,406
l don't think so.

69
00:07:19,531 --> 00:07:21,617
Anyway, it's
my birthday today, and...

70
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:23,869
there's a party tonight
at the Elkhorn.

71
00:07:23,994 --> 00:07:25,412
- l said that, didn't l?
- Yep.

72
00:07:25,537 --> 00:07:27,081
George!

73
00:07:27,206 --> 00:07:30,334
- Oh! l gotta look up here at 10:00.
- Why?

74
00:07:30,459 --> 00:07:32,336
Well, that's Doc Brunder's office.
Have you met him yet?

75
00:07:32,461 --> 00:07:36,298
- No. What does he want?
- l don't know.

76
00:07:36,423 --> 00:07:38,634
So, uh, hey, uh, you think, you think,
you could come to the party tonight?

77
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,761
No, l don't like to leave
my kids home alone at night.

78
00:07:40,886 --> 00:07:42,638
- Well, l, l know a good
baby-sitter. Tito's wife.
- l just live really far out.

79
00:07:42,763 --> 00:07:45,474
- You know, it's just really--
- You know Tito. Tito! Tito!

80
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,601
Hey, George.

81
00:07:47,726 --> 00:07:49,311
Hey, that's nice.

82
00:07:52,606 --> 00:07:55,359
Oh, God.

83
00:07:55,484 --> 00:07:58,988
- So, that's the doctor, huh?
- Yep, that's the doctor.

84
00:07:59,113 --> 00:08:00,489
Crazy doc.

85
00:08:02,908 --> 00:08:05,202
- Would you please come tonight?
- No, not tonight.

86
00:08:08,414 --> 00:08:10,624

87
00:08:10,749 --> 00:08:12,668
No, it's not you.

Well, then l'll keep askin'.

89
00:08:18,257 --> 00:08:21,552
Man, l would love to get

00:08:21,677 --> 00:08:23,762

91
00:08:31,145 --> 00:08:34,356
- He say, ''She sock it to ya.''

92
00:08:40,696 --> 00:08:43,782
Ooh, ooh

Oh, how l need ya

95
00:08:51,165 --> 00:08:52,833
- Hey, Nate, Nate!
- All you do is treat me bad

96
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:55,210
lt's a scandal,
you and Diana Ross.

97
00:08:55,336 --> 00:08:56,920
- l told the press.
- Oh, man!

98
00:08:57,046 --> 00:09:00,257
- Yep.
- She'd be so happy on my farm.

99
00:09:00,382 --> 00:09:02,092
- No stress.
- Oh, it's true.

100
00:09:02,217 --> 00:09:06,138
-No media. No press. Just-- Just heaven.
-Nothin'.

101
00:09:06,263 --> 00:09:07,598
Hey, you're not supposed
to be buyin' drinks tonight.

102
00:09:07,723 --> 00:09:08,641
Yeah.

103
00:09:08,766 --> 00:09:10,017
- Jimmy!
- Yo!

104
00:09:10,142 --> 00:09:12,061
George doesn't buy drinks tonight.
lt's his birthday.

105
00:09:12,186 --> 00:09:15,230
- Hey. For you.
- Hey, Doc. Hey, you made it.

106
00:09:15,356 --> 00:09:17,358
- Hey, Doc!
- How's everybody?

107
00:09:17,483 --> 00:09:19,360
- Hey, shh! Shh!
- Still breathing in and out?

108
00:09:19,485 --> 00:09:21,570
- Doc, you gotta--
you gotta try that cake.
- Hey, you guys.

109
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:24,865
-Tito's wife made it. lt is macho bueno.
-As usual.

110
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,700
Come on. Open it, George.
Open it.

111
00:09:26,825 --> 00:09:28,494
- Oh, Doc. Th-Thank you.
- Hey, Jimmy!

112
00:09:28,619 --> 00:09:30,579
- You're welcome.
- Yeah.

113
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:32,247
You're learning the moves, George,
but you've never played...

114
00:09:32,373 --> 00:09:35,084
against turmoil and confusion,
so here we go.

115
00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:37,753
l wish we could go back
to checkers. Maybe l could win.

116
00:09:37,878 --> 00:09:40,339
No, no, no, no, no. No, no.
You have potential, George.

117
00:09:40,464 --> 00:09:43,467
l always said, ''George Malley has
something extra to offer this world.''

118
00:09:43,592 --> 00:09:47,012
l said that the day l, uh,
circumcised you.

119
00:09:47,137 --> 00:09:50,516
- He says that every birthday.
- lt was a bad joke, l know.

120
00:09:50,641 --> 00:09:52,101
You know, you ruined my chance
of romance today...

121
00:09:52,226 --> 00:09:53,769
with that obscene stunt
in the window.

122
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:56,271
- lt was an outrage.
lt was a disgrace.
- lt was a criminal act.

123
00:09:56,397 --> 00:09:58,315
Okay, there was a beautiful girl
who walked right away from me.

124
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,608
lt was so embarrassing.

125
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:01,026
George, you talkin' about
the woman with the chairs?

126
00:10:01,151 --> 00:10:02,069
Yeah.

127
00:10:02,194 --> 00:10:03,988
Man, they are not
all that comfortable.

128
00:10:04,113 --> 00:10:06,448
Well, l think they're perfect.
You gotta learn how to sit in 'em.

129
00:10:06,573 --> 00:10:09,159
Ah, here you go.
On the house, everybody.

130
00:10:09,284 --> 00:10:10,494
- All right.
- Jimmy. Jimmy.

131
00:10:10,619 --> 00:10:12,079
There's no smoking section
in heaven.

132
00:10:12,204 --> 00:10:14,123
Ah, don't start, Doc.
Don't start.

133
00:10:14,248 --> 00:10:16,500
- George. George.
- Pass 'em out. Pass em' out.

134
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:22,298
- Hey, buddy.
- George.

135
00:10:22,423 --> 00:10:23,299
We love ya, man.

136
00:10:23,424 --> 00:10:24,842
- Y'all set?
- Yeah.

137
00:10:24,967 --> 00:10:28,345
Great. This is great.

138
00:10:28,554 --> 00:10:32,182
Tito, wait, wait, wait. Tito!

139
00:10:32,308 --> 00:10:34,977
Thanks for comin'
to my party, man.

140
00:10:35,102 --> 00:10:38,147
- Happy birthday, kid.
- Yup, happy birthday.

141
00:10:44,778 --> 00:10:46,155
Yup, happy birthday.

142
00:10:54,163 --> 00:10:56,498
Thirty-seven.

143
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:58,417
Thirty-seven.

144
00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:47,716
Anybody see that?
Th-Th-- There was that light--

145
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:51,303
- What kind of light?
- Th-Th-Th-There was a noise.
D-D-D-Did ya hear it?

146
00:11:51,428 --> 00:11:55,724
-No.
-Can we finish the game, George?

147
00:11:55,849 --> 00:12:00,854
Man, it, it, it was like, like, like, an
explosion, and, and, and it was a flash!

148
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:05,025
- Like a plane?
- No. lt was bigger than that.
lt wa-wa-wa-was farther away.

149
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:07,987
Oh, you mean,
like a star, George?

150
00:12:08,112 --> 00:12:10,239
Man, it knocked me off my feet.

151
00:12:10,364 --> 00:12:12,908
- You fell?
- Yeah, l fell. l was--

152
00:12:14,368 --> 00:12:16,620
The man's inebriated.

153
00:12:16,745 --> 00:12:19,039
- l warned you.
- l am not drunk, Nate.

154
00:12:19,164 --> 00:12:22,418
l'm taking your queen, George.
Now pay attention.

155
00:12:23,669 --> 00:12:25,671
lsn't that checkmate?

156
00:12:25,796 --> 00:12:29,091
That's checkmate, isn't it?

157
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:31,051
You mean he beat you?

158
00:12:31,176 --> 00:12:33,387
You let him win, Doc?
Birthday present?

159
00:12:33,512 --> 00:12:35,264
l didn't let him win anything.

160
00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:37,850
You're a little pissed off
about that, aren't ya?

161
00:12:37,975 --> 00:12:41,353
- Play another one?
- Y-Y-You can get your revenge
on me tomorrow, all right?

162
00:12:41,478 --> 00:12:43,355
- You feeling okay?
- Yep.

163
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,441
- Can you drive, George?
- Yeah, l'm all right.

164
00:12:45,566 --> 00:12:48,527
Hey, thanks, everybody.

165
00:12:48,652 --> 00:12:51,113
- Happy birthday, buddy.
- Happy birthday, George.

166
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:53,032
That was a good party.

167
00:13:10,341 --> 00:13:12,843
Oh, l can't sleep.

168
00:13:21,769 --> 00:13:22,936
That's it!

169
00:13:31,111 --> 00:13:33,364
- What?
- l figured it out.

170
00:13:33,489 --> 00:13:36,575
Jesus, George, what are you
doing calling me? lt's late.

171
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,952
l thought that farmers got up
when it was still dark?

172
00:13:39,078 --> 00:13:44,458
That's if you have cows.
l don't have any cows, George.

173
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:47,294
Now look. There's only one
explanation for that rabbit.

174
00:13:47,419 --> 00:13:48,712
What?

175
00:13:48,837 --> 00:13:50,798
You see, when l built
that fence higher and deeper,

176
00:13:50,923 --> 00:13:52,257
he was already in there.

177
00:13:52,383 --> 00:13:56,387
See, he was hiding.
l fenced him in.

178
00:13:56,512 --> 00:14:01,100
- There's only one thing l
can do now. Just let him out.
- Good night, George.

179
00:14:01,225 --> 00:14:02,685
Good night.

180
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:05,289
- Here's Roger.
- George, can l have my Bronco back?

181
00:15:05,414 --> 00:15:07,875
l don't have any cash right now,
but l need my car.

182
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,919
Well, l need some solar panels
installed on my roof.

183
00:15:11,045 --> 00:15:13,922
- l don't know
anything about solar.
- Well, Charlie Shipper does,

184
00:15:14,048 --> 00:15:16,425
and, uh, he needs a well
dug on his property.

185
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:19,762
You help him dig the well, he'll help me
with the panels, and l'll fix your car.

186
00:15:19,887 --> 00:15:22,473
Deal?

187
00:15:22,598 --> 00:15:24,350
Yeah, deal.

188
00:15:25,934 --> 00:15:28,979
l'll, uh, l'll call Charlie.

189
00:15:29,104 --> 00:15:31,899
Hi. l just called
about, uh, fixin' my brakes.

190
00:15:32,024 --> 00:15:33,859
Oh, yeah, yeah. l'll be right
with ya. Uh, Tito--

191
00:15:46,872 --> 00:15:50,459
- Come on.
- Tito, he speaks Spanish
better than l do now.

192
00:15:50,584 --> 00:15:53,379
Yeah, better than me too.

193
00:16:28,956 --> 00:16:32,126
All right. Where's the owner
and operator of this vehicle?

194
00:16:32,251 --> 00:16:35,421
- You a cop?
- Our mom's in the store.

195
00:16:35,546 --> 00:16:39,174
- Mm-hmm. You got the brake on, sport?
- His name's Al.

196
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,135
- And what's your name?
- Glory.

197
00:16:43,178 --> 00:16:45,681
Well, l'm George.
Pop the hood, Al.

198
00:16:47,975 --> 00:16:49,518
Why?

199
00:16:49,643 --> 00:16:51,186
You know how
to start this thing?

200
00:16:51,312 --> 00:16:52,521
Duh.

201
00:16:54,064 --> 00:16:56,483
Ah! Emergency
road service, ma'am.

202
00:16:56,608 --> 00:16:58,110
Your truck can't breathe
and your idle's too fast.

203
00:16:58,235 --> 00:17:00,946
Mmm, sorry. Gotta go.

204
00:17:01,071 --> 00:17:03,741
Where? You're not, uh,
leavin' town, are ya?

205
00:17:03,866 --> 00:17:05,909
No, just San Francisco,
for the day.

206
00:17:06,035 --> 00:17:08,954
Oh, l used to live there. Uh, a-a-ask,
ask me directions on where you're goin'.

207
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:11,206
As a matter of fact,
ask me anything at all.

208
00:17:11,332 --> 00:17:12,499
You could even ask me
to come along.

209
00:17:12,624 --> 00:17:14,543
l'd show you the sights,
hazards. Whattaya think?

210
00:17:14,668 --> 00:17:17,421
l think your idle's too fast.

211
00:17:17,546 --> 00:17:19,882
San Francisco, huh?
But you were born here, right?

212
00:17:20,007 --> 00:17:23,385
- How did you know l was born here?
- Just now, in the store. Someone said:

213
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:25,387
''l've known George Malley all my life,

214
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:29,475
and if he said he saw a UFO,
he saw one''.

215
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,435
l didn't say that.

216
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,772
- You saw one?
- But l didn't say what l saw.

217
00:17:34,897 --> 00:17:36,732
What'd it look like?

218
00:17:36,857 --> 00:17:38,692
Well, it could've been.

219
00:17:42,571 --> 00:17:43,906
That's 'mate, Doc.

220
00:17:44,031 --> 00:17:46,033
Wait, wait, wait! Wait, George!

221
00:17:46,158 --> 00:17:50,079
Now, what in the hell
is goin' on here? What?

222
00:17:50,204 --> 00:17:52,831
Look, you know, l don't know,
Doc. l-l-l really don't.

223
00:17:52,956 --> 00:17:56,251
Just lately l've been, been
seeing things so clearly, you know?

224
00:17:56,377 --> 00:18:00,005
And, uh, you know, uh,
l understand right away.

225
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:04,301
l concentrate. And books.
l can't stop feeding myself.

226
00:18:04,426 --> 00:18:07,096
l read two, two, three books a day.
lmagine that.

227
00:18:07,221 --> 00:18:12,893
And-And-And uh, you know, l can't stop
and l, l, can't sleep ever since the--

228
00:18:17,314 --> 00:18:20,109
l-l-- l gotta go.
Get back to work.

229
00:18:20,234 --> 00:18:23,112
Ever since the sighting.

230
00:18:23,237 --> 00:18:27,533
- Roger, it was a damn light!
- And a boom.

231
00:18:27,658 --> 00:18:29,076
Now, did you hear it?

232
00:18:29,201 --> 00:18:34,331
Well, no. Anybody?
About nine days ago, right outside here?

233
00:18:34,456 --> 00:18:38,585
Was that 12:00, George?

234
00:18:38,711 --> 00:18:41,255
George, come in for a physical, okay?

235
00:18:47,261 --> 00:18:51,473
George?
Two or three books a day?

236
00:18:51,598 --> 00:18:53,767
- At least.
- About what?

237
00:18:53,892 --> 00:18:57,604
About everything. You know,
all the things l've wanted
to know about and learn.

238
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:59,440
Like what?

239
00:18:59,565 --> 00:19:01,442
You tell me, Rog.

240
00:19:01,567 --> 00:19:04,486
l mean, what have you always wanted
to know about and learn? Hmm?

241
00:19:07,698 --> 00:19:09,825
Think about it.

242
00:19:20,169 --> 00:19:22,463
l'm waiting for ignition

243
00:19:22,588 --> 00:19:25,549
l'm looking for a spark

244
00:19:25,674 --> 00:19:30,763
Any chance collision
and l light up in the dark

245
00:19:30,888 --> 00:19:33,557
Such a mass of motion

246
00:19:33,682 --> 00:19:36,393
Do not know where it goes

247
00:19:36,518 --> 00:19:40,397
l move with the movement and

248
00:19:40,522 --> 00:19:41,732
l have the touch

249
00:19:46,695 --> 00:19:48,822
Any social occasion

250
00:19:48,947 --> 00:19:51,867
lt's hello, how do you do

251
00:19:51,992 --> 00:19:54,787
All those introductions

252
00:19:54,912 --> 00:19:57,331
l never miss my cue

253
00:19:57,456 --> 00:19:59,917
So before a question

254
00:20:00,042 --> 00:20:03,295
So before a doubt

255
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:06,548
My hand moves out and

256
00:20:06,674 --> 00:20:08,634
l have the touch

257
00:20:10,886 --> 00:20:16,100
Lonely, only
wanting contact with you

258
00:20:17,685 --> 00:20:20,145
Shake those hands

259
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:23,023
Shake those hands

260
00:20:23,148 --> 00:20:25,025
Shake hands

261
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,780
Shake hands

262
00:20:35,661 --> 00:20:37,663
l have the touch

263
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:44,169
CQ, this is W-B-6-Q-L-F
standing by.

264
00:20:44,295 --> 00:20:47,965
Searcher out of Harmon, California.
ls anybody in the void tonight?

265
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:52,386
l'm lookin' for Diana Ross, but l'll
accept any voice in the English tongue.

266
00:20:54,221 --> 00:20:55,764
ls that you, Diana?

267
00:20:57,391 --> 00:20:59,893
- Hey, George.
- Now look, Nate.

268
00:21:00,019 --> 00:21:03,314
You haven't sat until
you put your ass on one of
these home-made willow chairs. Okay?

269
00:21:03,439 --> 00:21:05,607
Now l bought you a pair
so you could put your feet up.

270
00:21:05,733 --> 00:21:10,279
Or, if you, uh, want a friend
to sit in there, if you decide
one day to invite someone over.

271
00:21:10,404 --> 00:21:11,697
Whattaya think?

272
00:21:13,824 --> 00:21:16,327
- l don't think they go, George
- Oh, what would you know?

273
00:21:16,452 --> 00:21:18,746
Looks like a swap meet
blew in here.

274
00:21:18,871 --> 00:21:22,291
Talk about needin' a woman's touch.
This is an emergency.

275
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:26,295
Hey, Nate. l've been workin'
on that solar kit you gave me.

276
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:30,924
l'm tellin' you, the whole field of
photovoltaics is, is just in babyland.

277
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:34,261
l mean, you know, th-the idea
that plants have been storing...

278
00:21:34,386 --> 00:21:37,765
and, and using the sun's energy
since the birth of the world.

279
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:40,476
l mean, photosynthesis is,
is a model for us,

280
00:21:40,601 --> 00:21:44,104
and, and we're just scratching
the surface of what we can do
with these silicon cells.

281
00:21:44,229 --> 00:21:46,732
l'm tellin' ya. What?

282
00:21:50,903 --> 00:21:52,363
What?

283
00:21:52,488 --> 00:21:55,616
You just talk so fast, George,
and, and you know so much stuff.

284
00:21:55,741 --> 00:22:00,079
l'm sorry.
l can't help it, Nate.

285
00:22:00,204 --> 00:22:02,164
lt's okay.

286
00:22:04,124 --> 00:22:07,211
- What is that?
- Oh, it's just computers
talking to computers.

287
00:22:07,336 --> 00:22:09,505
Shh. Leave it,
leave it, leave it.

288
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:12,049
Ah, come on. The Morse code's
goin' too fast for you to pick that out.

289
00:22:12,174 --> 00:22:14,635
No, no, no, no. lt's-- lt's--
l can hear it.

290
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,304
- Bull.
- No, l'll tell ya what it is.
A repeated pattern.

291
00:22:17,429 --> 00:22:19,348
They're looping a message.

292
00:22:19,473 --> 00:22:24,436
- ''Watering the golds F-Friday.''
- Yeah, yeah.

293
00:22:24,561 --> 00:22:27,815
Now who'd be sending a coded message
like that in simple Morse?

294
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:30,776
Oh, man, look. l pick up like
two different air force bases.

295
00:22:30,901 --> 00:22:32,736
l think we better
leave this one alone, George.

296
00:22:32,861 --> 00:22:35,447
Mm, no, no. This is
a different one. Listen, listen.

297
00:22:35,572 --> 00:22:38,993
This one's much denser, but it's still
a loop; it still repeats. Listen.

298
00:22:41,036 --> 00:22:42,746
- Seriously, l think we--
- Oh, l gotta record this.

299
00:22:42,871 --> 00:22:44,623
- l think we need to leave this alone.
- Hey, where's your--

300
00:22:44,748 --> 00:22:46,667
- No, no, no, no, no.
- What are you doin'?

301
00:22:46,792 --> 00:22:49,712
Well, l want to take it home
so l can break it down,
and then we can answer it.

302
00:22:49,837 --> 00:22:52,798
- Why?
- Because it gives me
something to do, Nate.

303
00:22:58,595 --> 00:23:01,181
l don't know if it's getting worse
or it's gettin' better, but--

304
00:23:01,307 --> 00:23:04,310
You know, l have 12 hours
in the night to kill, and l--

305
00:23:04,435 --> 00:23:09,064
When l get tired of reading,
l do crossword puzzles,
but they're all too simple.

306
00:23:09,189 --> 00:23:12,318
Too simple?

307
00:23:12,443 --> 00:23:15,529
And then everybody l know is asleep,
and l'm, l'm awake at night.

308
00:23:15,654 --> 00:23:18,198
ls there something, um,
something l could do?

309
00:23:18,324 --> 00:23:21,869
Hey! Why don't we
just go outside and box?

310
00:23:21,994 --> 00:23:25,205
l could split your lip again.
You'll-- Ya-- You'll feel a lot better.

311
00:23:25,331 --> 00:23:26,624
No!

312
00:23:28,459 --> 00:23:30,669
Hey, if you send a message,
would they get it?

313
00:23:30,794 --> 00:23:33,088
Yeah, sure. Um--

314
00:23:33,213 --> 00:23:34,965
Send this. Send them...

315
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:37,760
''Don't, uh-- Don't overwater
the golds.'' Say that.

316
00:23:37,885 --> 00:23:40,929
- Okay, fine. The golds?
- Marigolds.
- Oh, yeah.

317
00:23:41,055 --> 00:23:44,725
No, no, no. Say:
''Don't overwater the marigolds Friday.''

318
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:47,519
''Don't overwater...

319
00:23:47,645 --> 00:23:51,148
- the marigolds on Friday.''
- Right.

320
00:23:51,273 --> 00:23:53,567
- ''We'll be watching.''
- Yeah, yeah. We'll be watching.
- How does that sound?

321
00:23:53,692 --> 00:23:55,986
Oh, my God. This is cool.

322
00:24:35,234 --> 00:24:38,654
lt's okay, Attila. lt's nothing.
Static electricity, that's all.

323
00:24:38,779 --> 00:24:41,156
That's all it is.

324
00:24:42,783 --> 00:24:44,952
See, here. Here you go.

325
00:24:45,077 --> 00:24:48,372
Okay. All right. Okay.

326
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:57,673
Oh, God.

327
00:24:57,798 --> 00:25:00,884
Oh, God! Oh, man!

328
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:05,723
ls somebody trying
to tell me something? Huh?

329
00:25:08,684 --> 00:25:11,020
What?

330
00:25:21,989 --> 00:25:24,033
- Did ya pee in the cup?
- Yep.

331
00:25:24,158 --> 00:25:27,036
- Still having trouble sleeping?
- Yep. Any ideas?

332
00:25:29,663 --> 00:25:31,123
How long you been
feeling this way?

333
00:25:31,248 --> 00:25:33,042
You know how long
l've been feeling this way.

334
00:25:33,167 --> 00:25:38,005
Everybody does. lt's been
over a month since my birthday.

335
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:40,716
Notice anything else, or--

336
00:25:42,926 --> 00:25:46,096
- Yeah.
- What?

337
00:25:48,474 --> 00:25:52,311
- Well, watch your fountain pen there.
- Whattaya mean?

338
00:26:03,697 --> 00:26:05,658
- lt's telekinesis.
- Yeah.

339
00:26:07,701 --> 00:26:09,161
ls that okay?

340
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,248
Do it again. Do it again.

341
00:26:28,222 --> 00:26:32,935
You know, l consider myself
a rational man. A man of science.

342
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:38,899
You know, open to whatever.
But, uh, l feel like a child, George.

343
00:26:39,024 --> 00:26:41,694
- l feel scared.
- Me too.

344
00:26:45,572 --> 00:26:48,826
Well, whatever the reason is,
l promise you we'll find it. Okay?

345
00:26:50,619 --> 00:26:53,998
Now, let me see you
do that one more time.

346
00:27:02,715 --> 00:27:04,800
lt's a monster, George.

347
00:27:04,925 --> 00:27:09,805
Yep, yep. This old Frankenstein here
gets 90 miles to the gallon on methane,

348
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:13,684
and it's made from my garbage
and Nate's pig manure.

349
00:27:13,809 --> 00:27:17,021
- Special blend.
- Sure smells like it.

350
00:27:21,817 --> 00:27:23,736
See, Georgie.

351
00:27:25,612 --> 00:27:28,449
- Hello, Lace.
- Hey. These are a little bit different.

352
00:27:28,574 --> 00:27:32,328
- l used a little bit
of a wider branch on these.
- Yeah, they look great.

353
00:27:32,453 --> 00:27:33,495
George, are these yours?

354
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,664
Yeah, yeah. l've been
working on some, uh,

355
00:27:35,789 --> 00:27:37,499
special organic fertilizers.

356
00:27:37,625 --> 00:27:39,585
- Go ahead. Taste it.
- Mmm.

357
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:42,546
No, no, no. Bite into it
like a, like an apple.

358
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,344
You got some on your chin. Sorry.

359
00:27:51,347 --> 00:27:54,600
Maybe, uh, maybe
the kids would like some?

360
00:27:54,725 --> 00:27:57,019
- lt's great. Thanks.
- No, no, no. Wait. Wait.

361
00:27:57,144 --> 00:27:58,520
Let me pick some out for you.

362
00:27:58,646 --> 00:27:59,938
lf the kids like them, you know,

363
00:28:00,064 --> 00:28:02,608
y-y-you could make anything.

364
00:28:02,733 --> 00:28:04,693
You could make a sauce or a soup.

365
00:28:08,989 --> 00:28:10,532
George, l thought you were smart.

366
00:28:10,658 --> 00:28:12,618
Hey, what she got, anyway?

367
00:28:12,743 --> 00:28:15,204
Yeah, yeah,
besides uncomfortable chairs.

368
00:28:17,873 --> 00:28:22,252
My heart, amigos. My heart.

369
00:28:22,378 --> 00:28:24,713
Jump in, let's go

370
00:28:27,007 --> 00:28:30,052
Lay back, enjoy the show

371
00:28:31,011 --> 00:28:33,389
Jump in, let's go

372
00:28:35,182 --> 00:28:38,477
These are the days
when anything goes

373
00:28:38,602 --> 00:28:42,064
Every day is a winding road

374
00:28:44,525 --> 00:28:46,819
l get a little bit closer

375
00:28:46,944 --> 00:28:50,739
Every day is a faded sign

376
00:28:52,741 --> 00:28:54,910
- l get a little bit closer
- Hey, George! Where do you
think you're goin'?

377
00:28:55,035 --> 00:28:57,496
- To feelin' fine
- You guys going home?

378
00:28:57,621 --> 00:28:58,998
You want a ride?

379
00:28:59,123 --> 00:29:00,874
- Okay.
- Glory!

380
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,628
- Oh, what?
- Glory, come on.

381
00:29:04,753 --> 00:29:07,840
- Would you come on?
- All right.

382
00:29:07,965 --> 00:29:09,717
- Al!
- Okay.

383
00:29:09,842 --> 00:29:12,511
Hurry. Hurry up!

384
00:29:13,721 --> 00:29:15,389
Jump in, let's go

385
00:29:17,683 --> 00:29:20,936
These are the days
when anything goes

386
00:29:21,061 --> 00:29:26,692
Every day is a winding road
l'm feelin' fine

387
00:29:26,817 --> 00:29:29,445
- Are those for our mom?
- Yep.

388
00:29:31,322 --> 00:29:33,490
l thought flowers were for dates.

389
00:29:35,075 --> 00:29:38,287
- Don't get spooky, Al.
- Did she invite you?

390
00:29:40,998 --> 00:29:42,708
Hey, wait a minute!

391
00:29:42,833 --> 00:29:45,252
Blue. l don't have blue.

392
00:29:46,587 --> 00:29:49,923
Every day is a winding road

393
00:29:55,054 --> 00:29:57,640
- Every day is a winding road
- Oh, great.

394
00:30:08,275 --> 00:30:11,654
- You guys know the name
of this, uh, this flower?
- No.
- No.

395
00:30:11,779 --> 00:30:13,947
A Delphinium belladonna.

396
00:30:14,073 --> 00:30:16,325
That's the Ranunculaceae family.

397
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:17,951
l didn't always know
the names of flowers,

398
00:30:18,077 --> 00:30:21,914
but it seems, recently, that l can
pretty much name any flower l see.

399
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:26,251
- Mmm.
- Yeah. Like this one
is Lamonium Sabbatom.

400
00:30:26,377 --> 00:30:28,045
And, uh, this is the, uh--

401
00:30:30,297 --> 00:30:33,133
Doesn't make them
any prettier though.

402
00:30:34,259 --> 00:30:36,011
ls that a garbage bag tie?

403
00:30:36,136 --> 00:30:39,890
Yeah. l was improvising.

404
00:30:43,143 --> 00:30:44,979
Hey, now, that's a good idea.

405
00:30:55,072 --> 00:30:57,449
Ah, that's much better.

406
00:30:57,574 --> 00:30:58,701
Yep.

407
00:30:58,826 --> 00:31:00,244
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

408
00:31:04,123 --> 00:31:07,251
Every day is a winding road

409
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:11,922
Every day is a winding road

410
00:31:13,632 --> 00:31:15,592
My mom's around back!

411
00:31:16,927 --> 00:31:20,514
Every day is a winding road

412
00:31:20,639 --> 00:31:22,725
Lace?

413
00:31:23,976 --> 00:31:27,646
- Hi.
- Hi.

414
00:31:27,771 --> 00:31:29,773
Now, you didn't nearly
take enough tomatoes,

415
00:31:29,898 --> 00:31:32,901
and l'm very proud of them.

416
00:31:33,027 --> 00:31:36,780
Well, there you go. And, uh--

417
00:31:36,905 --> 00:31:39,241
l got you these.

418
00:31:39,366 --> 00:31:42,578
Well, that's every wildflower
from my, my house to your house.

419
00:31:42,703 --> 00:31:44,038
Your kids helped.

420
00:31:44,163 --> 00:31:46,415
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

421
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:49,835
- Hey, what are ya workin' on?
- Nah, nothin'.

422
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,004
Nothing.

423
00:31:52,129 --> 00:31:55,549
Wow, that's, that's really great work.
Look at this.

424
00:31:55,674 --> 00:31:59,178
- Beautiful.
- Ah, you want to, um, walk?

425
00:31:59,303 --> 00:32:01,388
Sure.

426
00:32:01,513 --> 00:32:04,933
- Shh.
- l-l-l gotta tell ya,
you know, you got great kids.

427
00:32:05,059 --> 00:32:08,354
Yeah, they are great kids, but you
don't really know that yet, George,

428
00:32:08,479 --> 00:32:11,649
because you don't know them,
and you don't know me.

429
00:32:11,774 --> 00:32:14,735
-Well, uh, l'm tryin' to get to know ya.
-l know.

430
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:17,321
l-- l really want to keep
my life very simple.

431
00:32:17,446 --> 00:32:19,948
Even predictable.
That's why l moved here.

432
00:32:21,909 --> 00:32:25,371
l don't like surprises,
and l don't like complications.

433
00:32:27,539 --> 00:32:29,124
What happened to you, Lace?

434
00:32:31,377 --> 00:32:32,962
Ah, l'm sorry.
Th-That's none of my business.

435
00:32:33,087 --> 00:32:34,838
- No, no. That's okay.
- l'm stupid.

436
00:32:34,964 --> 00:32:39,176
- l'm so sorry.
- So let me ask you something, George.

437
00:32:39,301 --> 00:32:42,721
When a man comes over with a basketful
of tomatoes, what is he expecting?

438
00:32:42,846 --> 00:32:47,810
- Dinner?
- No, no, no. Just hoping.

439
00:32:49,645 --> 00:32:51,563
Trifolium?

440
00:32:51,689 --> 00:32:55,818
Y-Y-You don't have any purple
in those flowers l got you, do ya?

441
00:32:55,943 --> 00:32:58,779
Whoa. D-D-Did ya feel that?

442
00:32:58,904 --> 00:33:00,656
Feel what?

443
00:33:00,781 --> 00:33:02,574
Whoa.

444
00:33:05,744 --> 00:33:07,663
W-W-Well, come here.
Come here. That's it.

445
00:33:07,788 --> 00:33:09,331
Okay.

446
00:33:09,456 --> 00:33:12,751
- Feel that. Right there.
- Feel what?

447
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:18,215
Oh, God. l think
l know what this is.

448
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,883
- What?
- C-C-Could l use your phone?

449
00:33:20,009 --> 00:33:23,137
Yeah.

450
00:33:23,262 --> 00:33:25,556
Okay, yeah.

451
00:33:25,681 --> 00:33:29,018
Just east of Harmon.
You know which one l'm talking about?

452
00:33:29,143 --> 00:33:31,812
No, l-l was told to call you,
and l'm telling you right now...

453
00:33:31,937 --> 00:33:33,772
that l picked up
on some activity.

454
00:33:35,149 --> 00:33:38,527
No, we didn't use
any instrumentation.

455
00:33:38,652 --> 00:33:42,031
No, l don't have a degree
and l haven't studied anywhere,
but l'm just tryin' t--

456
00:33:42,156 --> 00:33:46,243
Are you shutting me down here?
ls that what's going on?
Are you trying to shut me down?

457
00:33:46,368 --> 00:33:49,538
Look l'm just tryin' to tell you
that l felt the compression waves, okay?

458
00:33:49,663 --> 00:33:52,082
ULF. Ultra-low frequency waves.
Now, now, they have...

459
00:33:52,207 --> 00:33:54,585
the ability to make you
nauseous and dizzy. Am l right?

460
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:56,545
Okay, well, that's what l felt!

461
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:58,964
And-- And l'm tryin' to tell you
that, that l think that there--

462
00:34:00,841 --> 00:34:02,593
There's an earthquake coming.

463
00:34:04,845 --> 00:34:08,724
Um, listen, Al. Why don't you put
some masking tape on the cupboards?

464
00:34:08,849 --> 00:34:11,560
And, Glory, bring
the vases down and the china.

465
00:34:39,713 --> 00:34:41,298
This is good, Lace.

466
00:34:43,133 --> 00:34:47,388
- l think you're a good cook.
- No, l'm not.

467
00:34:47,513 --> 00:34:52,101
l only make two things pretty well.
Pork chops and, um, turkey.

468
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:57,356
Which is this?

469
00:35:01,068 --> 00:35:03,112
l'm just--

470
00:35:15,916 --> 00:35:18,460
Look!

471
00:35:25,092 --> 00:35:27,720
- Al.
- Hmm.

472
00:35:27,845 --> 00:35:29,680
- Oh, you.
- l was just joking.

473
00:35:29,805 --> 00:35:32,975
Oh, please.

474
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:35,269
Oh, you scared me.

475
00:35:37,521 --> 00:35:39,315
Not funny.

476
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:49,533
Thanks.

477
00:35:55,914 --> 00:35:59,585
- All right. Can l say it now?
- What's that?

478
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:01,962
- You've got great kids.
- Oh, thanks.

479
00:36:02,087 --> 00:36:04,131
- And l thank you for dinner.
- You're welcome.

480
00:36:04,256 --> 00:36:07,217
- And good night.
- Good night.

481
00:36:07,343 --> 00:36:09,219
Good night.

482
00:36:12,598 --> 00:36:15,726
- Shh. She's coming.
- Tell her.

483
00:36:15,851 --> 00:36:17,978
- No, you tell her.
- Shh.

484
00:36:18,103 --> 00:36:19,897
- Shh.
- Come on.

485
00:36:22,149 --> 00:36:24,526
- He's neat.
- Yeah, he's nice, isn't he?

486
00:36:24,652 --> 00:36:28,113
Yeah, but he thinks he saw a UFO and
he thinks he can predict earthquakes.

487
00:36:28,238 --> 00:36:30,074
There may be a warning here.

488
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:33,243
- But he never said
for sure it was a UFO.
- Yeah.

489
00:36:35,454 --> 00:36:37,581
Oh, Jesus! Doorway! Doorway!

490
00:36:45,255 --> 00:36:46,548
Let's get in the truck.
Get in the truck.

491
00:36:46,674 --> 00:36:49,093
- lt's over, Mom.
- l know it's over. Let's go. Now.

492
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:04,817
Did you feel it, huh?

493
00:37:04,942 --> 00:37:07,069
Did you get scared, huh?

494
00:37:07,194 --> 00:37:09,947
Do you realize
the possibilities of this, huh?

495
00:37:10,072 --> 00:37:11,907
Do you know what this means?

496
00:37:19,707 --> 00:37:23,043
You felt it, didn't you?

497
00:37:23,168 --> 00:37:24,837
- You did!
- What is going on, George?

498
00:37:24,962 --> 00:37:27,256
- Wasn't that amazing?
- Tell me what's happening.

499
00:37:27,381 --> 00:37:30,050
l don't know. l don't--
l don't know.

500
00:37:30,175 --> 00:37:32,428
l need the simple truth, George.

501
00:37:32,553 --> 00:37:36,098
This is the truth. W-W-W-What's
happening to me i-i-is the truth.

502
00:37:48,986 --> 00:37:50,779
Oh, no.

503
00:37:56,785 --> 00:37:58,120
Lace.

504
00:38:06,879 --> 00:38:10,883
l love those chairs, Lace.
l love them. l didn't--

505
00:38:12,301 --> 00:38:16,180
Y-You made them. Okay?
All right?

506
00:38:18,807 --> 00:38:20,643
l wanted to see you, okay?
l mean--

507
00:38:20,768 --> 00:38:22,978
Bring them back to the shop tomorrow.
l'll give you your money back.

508
00:38:23,103 --> 00:38:24,355
l don't want
my money back, Lace.

509
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,398
l just asked you
for one thing, George.

510
00:38:26,523 --> 00:38:29,818
The truth.
And you couldn't handle it.

511
00:38:51,548 --> 00:38:55,010
- George, haven't you called her yet?
- Never mind about that, will ya?

512
00:38:55,135 --> 00:38:56,595
N-N-Now this is the second one.
Gladiolus. Remember that.

513
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,347
How do you know
she's still mad at you?

514
00:38:58,472 --> 00:39:00,015
l know. Now, all right.

515
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:02,184
- Write her a note.
- No, no, no. l found this.

516
00:39:02,309 --> 00:39:04,228
Classic five-bed garden pattern. Here.

517
00:39:04,353 --> 00:39:06,939
Flowers. You should send
her flowers or candies.

518
00:39:07,064 --> 00:39:09,400
Yeah. Marigolds, gladiolus,
roses, etcetera.

519
00:39:09,525 --> 00:39:11,402
And l went to the library...

520
00:39:11,527 --> 00:39:15,114
and l looked up the missile silo pattern
at the Masterson Air Force Base,

521
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:17,533
and l made my, my own overlay.

522
00:39:17,658 --> 00:39:20,619
And here we go. There.

523
00:39:20,744 --> 00:39:23,831
- Yeah.
- See, that, that's their,
that's their garden.

524
00:39:23,956 --> 00:39:25,791
You see? Well, that's old stuff.

525
00:39:25,916 --> 00:39:27,543
lt's, uh, and it's, uh,
declassified.

526
00:39:27,668 --> 00:39:29,211
But now this stuff is trickier.

527
00:39:29,336 --> 00:39:32,548
This is, uh, trigraphs
and tetragraphs and ABBA class.

528
00:39:32,673 --> 00:39:33,799
- George--
- Yep?

529
00:39:33,924 --> 00:39:36,010
Why don't you just tell me
what you want me to send?

530
00:39:36,135 --> 00:39:39,054
All right. Send this.
Why don't you send this?

531
00:39:39,179 --> 00:39:41,807
''Mind your garden. Frost coming.
Luck on the Mozop.''

532
00:39:41,932 --> 00:39:43,600
Want to know what Mozop is?

533
00:39:43,726 --> 00:39:46,020
lt's okay.
lt's your game, George.

534
00:39:46,145 --> 00:39:48,272
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Have you sat in this chair yet?

535
00:39:48,397 --> 00:39:49,732
- lt's nice.
- Yeah, yeah.

536
00:39:49,857 --> 00:39:50,983
You should give her
a call right now.

537
00:39:51,108 --> 00:39:54,653
Naw. Let her cool off.

538
00:39:54,778 --> 00:39:57,239
l figure l'll give her 'bout a year.

539
00:39:58,741 --> 00:40:00,242
Pick up the phone and call her, George.

540
00:40:00,367 --> 00:40:02,244
Look who's talkin'.

541
00:40:02,369 --> 00:40:05,748
Diana Ross fan club, right? Have
you said ten words to a woman this year?

542
00:40:11,629 --> 00:40:16,258
- Ah, l'm sorry, Nate.
- Your transmission's finished, sir.

543
00:40:16,383 --> 00:40:19,762
l've just been going
through some things lately.

544
00:40:19,887 --> 00:40:21,847
Everybody's going through somethin'.

545
00:40:21,972 --> 00:40:25,934
l know, but, uh, this thing's
been hard for me to handle.

546
00:40:27,895 --> 00:40:29,229
Let me show you somethin'.

547
00:41:01,762 --> 00:41:03,806
You suppose they magnetized you?

548
00:41:03,931 --> 00:41:07,351
l don't know, buddy. l wish l did.

549
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:19,947
- What we got here?
- Doc, are we glad to see you.
You better hurry. This man--

550
00:41:23,575 --> 00:41:27,663
One of you go to the garbage and
bring me any food containers you find.

551
00:41:27,788 --> 00:41:32,626
Somebody else, go in the cabinets
and look for damaged or swollen cans.

552
00:41:32,751 --> 00:41:35,129
- Food poisoning.
- l think.

553
00:41:35,254 --> 00:41:37,589
Now what the hell is he saying?
Who speaks Spanish?

554
00:41:37,715 --> 00:41:40,175
That's Portuguese.
They just came in last week.

555
00:41:40,301 --> 00:41:41,927
Portuguese?

556
00:41:43,512 --> 00:41:46,849
He's trying to tell us
something about Berto.

557
00:41:46,974 --> 00:41:48,684
That's the little one.
lt's a little boy.

558
00:41:48,809 --> 00:41:50,686
All right, some of you
search around here for the kid.

559
00:41:50,811 --> 00:41:53,397
l'm gonna tell you right now,
he could be pretty darn sick.

560
00:41:53,522 --> 00:41:55,566
Now, Bonnie, wait. Uh--

561
00:41:55,691 --> 00:41:57,901
Get on the phone
and get George Malley over here.

562
00:41:58,027 --> 00:42:01,572
Tell him what's goin' on, and
tell him to stop at the library
for an English/Portuguese book.

563
00:42:01,697 --> 00:42:05,826
Tell him to find out how to ask
where a lost boy is.

564
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:08,245
- Got that?
- George Malley?

565
00:42:08,370 --> 00:42:10,664
You bet. George.

566
00:42:10,789 --> 00:42:12,249
Go on. Do it. Just go on. Go on!

567
00:42:19,506 --> 00:42:21,258
Don't you answer that?

568
00:42:21,383 --> 00:42:23,469
Not when l'm workin'.

569
00:42:23,594 --> 00:42:27,431
l've been farmin' all my life,
but this growth is amazing, George.

570
00:42:31,018 --> 00:42:35,064
-This is embarrassin'.
-You know, l wanna try this
fertilizer on your south 40.

571
00:42:35,189 --> 00:42:37,274
You just sprayed my boots.

572
00:42:37,399 --> 00:42:38,734
lt's the worst soil in the county.

573
00:42:38,859 --> 00:42:41,070
Can't even get weeds
to grow in that field.

574
00:42:41,195 --> 00:42:42,863
But l bet we can get corn
to grow in that field.

575
00:42:42,988 --> 00:42:46,241
You bet? You don't have
any money to bet.

576
00:42:46,367 --> 00:42:48,160
You spent all your money
on chairs, remember?

577
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:04,802
George Malley?

578
00:43:04,927 --> 00:43:08,263
- Yeah, l'm George Malley.
- l'm John Ringold.

579
00:43:08,389 --> 00:43:10,307
We talked on the phone the other day.

580
00:43:10,432 --> 00:43:11,600
- John Ringold?
- Yes.

581
00:43:11,725 --> 00:43:13,143
- From Berkeley?
- Yes.

582
00:43:13,268 --> 00:43:16,605
All right. Hi. Hey,
l'm glad you came by.

583
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:18,983
- Will your dog let me step out?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

584
00:43:19,108 --> 00:43:21,777
Well, he just has a thing
for seismologists.

585
00:43:21,902 --> 00:43:23,946
- Yeah, come on out.
- Thank you.

586
00:43:24,071 --> 00:43:25,656
Yeah, this is
my friend, Nate Pope.

587
00:43:25,781 --> 00:43:27,616
- How do?
- How do you do?

588
00:43:27,741 --> 00:43:29,493
W-W-Well, let me get you
a cold drink. Come on in.

589
00:43:29,618 --> 00:43:31,412
- From the university, huh?
- Yes.
- Uh-huh.

590
00:43:31,537 --> 00:43:33,497
And, uh, we are
very interested in how...

591
00:43:33,622 --> 00:43:36,500
you were able to predict
that earthquake, Mr Malley.

592
00:43:36,625 --> 00:43:38,585
Oh, that.

593
00:43:38,711 --> 00:43:42,006
You see, l, l, just picked up
the subsonic frequency waves, right?

594
00:43:42,131 --> 00:43:44,800
And, of course, l was standing
on the fault, so that made it easier.

595
00:43:44,925 --> 00:43:48,470
- W-W-What instrumentation did you use?
- Just me.

596
00:43:48,595 --> 00:43:51,682
lf you think that's somethin',
you should see him
move stuff with his brain.

597
00:43:51,807 --> 00:43:55,936
Nate, never mind that. You see,
l felt the ultra-low frequency waves,

598
00:43:56,061 --> 00:43:58,522
and they kind of made me
dizzy and nauseous, right?

599
00:43:58,647 --> 00:43:59,982
And that's how
l perceived all this.

600
00:44:00,107 --> 00:44:04,236
We've been studying quake prediction
for ten years.

601
00:44:04,361 --> 00:44:08,282
There's no record of any person
ever feeling the pre-quake activity.

602
00:44:08,407 --> 00:44:10,367
Now there is.

603
00:44:12,286 --> 00:44:15,664
We have some ULF equipment
in our labs.

604
00:44:15,789 --> 00:44:17,458
Could you come in
for an experiment?

605
00:44:17,583 --> 00:44:20,002
- Come to Berkeley?
- Yes.

606
00:44:20,127 --> 00:44:22,129
Yes.

607
00:44:22,254 --> 00:44:25,007
Well, my department would like
to interview you and clear this up.

608
00:44:25,132 --> 00:44:28,218
l-l-l would be-- l would be
so glad to come to Berkeley.

609
00:44:28,344 --> 00:44:31,305
Do you-- Do you think l could meet
w-w-with some other departments as well?

610
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:34,308
l-l-l have some experiments l'd,
l'd like to show you. Come with me.

611
00:44:36,143 --> 00:44:38,520
They're nice.

612
00:44:40,022 --> 00:44:42,149
All right. Well, uh, let's see.

613
00:44:42,274 --> 00:44:46,236
Um-- Oh, oh, yes.
Here. Okay, now look, um--

614
00:44:46,362 --> 00:44:49,490
l've taken solar panels, and
l've actually germinated the seeds...

615
00:44:49,615 --> 00:44:51,700
t-that made these,
these, these plants grow.

616
00:44:51,825 --> 00:44:53,619
l'm trying to change
the electromagnetic field, right?

617
00:44:53,744 --> 00:44:56,830
- Um, Mr Malley?
- l took, uh, incandescent lighting,

618
00:44:56,956 --> 00:44:58,290
- Mr Malley?
- and l turned it into sunlight,

619
00:44:58,415 --> 00:45:00,542
which actually made
these, these plants grow.

620
00:45:00,668 --> 00:45:02,795
- Mr Malley?
- Oh, now, look--

621
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:06,548
l-l took pig manure,
and l turned it into a f-fuel...

622
00:45:06,674 --> 00:45:08,258
which l-l believe
will actually run an automobile.

623
00:45:08,384 --> 00:45:10,511
All l'm interested in
is the earthquake.

624
00:45:10,636 --> 00:45:16,266
We need to know if
that was a fluke, a coincidence.

625
00:45:16,392 --> 00:45:19,019
A fluke?

626
00:45:19,144 --> 00:45:21,730
George, why don't you
move something with your mind?

627
00:45:24,066 --> 00:45:26,568
Maybe move his, uh,
something like that?

628
00:45:26,694 --> 00:45:29,738
- Look, Mr Ringold--
- Doctor.

629
00:45:29,863 --> 00:45:33,784
D-D-Doctor Ringold, uh,
l-l-- Look, l--

630
00:45:33,909 --> 00:45:36,787
l've got-- l've got my garden out there,
and t-t-that acts like a lab, right?

631
00:45:36,912 --> 00:45:39,081
And l, l got everything
that you see here, but l--

632
00:45:39,206 --> 00:45:41,417
- l really need to talk
to people like you, okay?
- Hey, George!

633
00:45:41,542 --> 00:45:44,628
- George, are you home?
- Please don't go, okay?

634
00:45:44,753 --> 00:45:47,256
- George, get out here!
- Please-- Just please don't go.

635
00:45:47,381 --> 00:45:50,134
Hey, George!

636
00:45:50,259 --> 00:45:52,553
George, Doc says,
you better come right now!

637
00:45:52,678 --> 00:45:53,762
What's the matter?

638
00:45:53,887 --> 00:45:56,015
Come on, man.
lt's an emergency!

639
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:58,225
You gotta learn how to talk Portuguese
on the way over there.

640
00:45:58,350 --> 00:46:00,811
l gotta go.

641
00:46:00,936 --> 00:46:04,231
Portuguese? Learn Portuguese?

642
00:46:05,524 --> 00:46:07,318
Why don't you go along, Professor?

643
00:46:25,878 --> 00:46:29,214
George, Doc's inside.
He thinks it's food poisoning.

644
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:31,884
Hey, George.

645
00:46:32,009 --> 00:46:36,305
- Hey, Doc. George is here.
- He's gonna be fine, George,
but his grandson is missing.

646
00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:38,766
Now, if they ate the same thing,
the boy could be a lot worse off.

647
00:46:38,891 --> 00:46:40,100
You brought the book?

648
00:46:40,225 --> 00:46:41,560
- Yeah, l have it.
- All right. Okay.

649
00:46:41,685 --> 00:46:43,771
Ask him where the boy is?

650
00:46:48,776 --> 00:46:50,527
He's in orchard.
He said he's in the orchard.

651
00:46:50,653 --> 00:46:51,862
All right. Okay.

652
00:47:00,663 --> 00:47:03,666
He said that they ate something bad,
and he thinks the b-- the boy is sick.

653
00:47:22,309 --> 00:47:24,937
Tito drove the truck
while l-l read the book.

654
00:47:25,062 --> 00:47:30,025
George Malley. You learned
the Portuguese language in 20 minutes?

655
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:32,945
Not all of it.

656
00:47:33,153 --> 00:47:36,031
- What are we lookin' for here, a kid?
- What's the kid's name?

657
00:47:36,156 --> 00:47:41,161
- lt's Alberto. Berto, Alberto, yeah.
- Alberto? Alberto.

658
00:47:41,287 --> 00:47:44,999
Now, let-- let's spread out
and comb these-- comb these trees.
Everybody, let's go.

659
00:47:45,124 --> 00:47:46,834
- Okay.
- Look real careful.
- Alberto!

660
00:47:46,959 --> 00:47:48,502
Call out his name.

661
00:47:48,627 --> 00:47:51,588
- Alberto!
- Alberto!
- Alberto!

662
00:47:51,714 --> 00:47:55,050
- Alberto!
- Alberto!
- Alberto!

663
00:47:55,175 --> 00:47:57,928
- Berto!
- Alberto!
- Alberto!

664
00:48:00,347 --> 00:48:04,810
- Where are you, kid?
- Alberto, where are you, fella?
We're comin'.

665
00:48:04,935 --> 00:48:06,895
- Alberto!
- Alberto!

666
00:48:10,024 --> 00:48:12,901
- Berto!
- Berto!

667
00:48:13,027 --> 00:48:15,070
No, nothin' over here!

668
00:48:52,149 --> 00:48:54,818
George, whatcha got!

669
00:48:54,943 --> 00:48:57,154
Huh? What?

670
00:48:57,279 --> 00:48:59,156
- He's not in the orchard.
- Huh?

671
00:48:59,281 --> 00:49:01,116
He's sick, Doc.

672
00:49:04,036 --> 00:49:07,081
- He's there.
- Where is he, George? Where?

673
00:49:07,206 --> 00:49:09,291
- Over here.
- Okay. Let's go.

674
00:49:12,461 --> 00:49:15,172
We're with you.
We're with you.

675
00:49:16,382 --> 00:49:18,133
What's goin' on?

676
00:49:31,188 --> 00:49:33,399
You okay, George?

677
00:49:33,524 --> 00:49:36,068
lt's not me. lt's him.

678
00:49:36,193 --> 00:49:39,029
Tell me where he is.

679
00:49:39,154 --> 00:49:42,825
l don't know. l don't know.

680
00:50:02,886 --> 00:50:04,513
Look! There's a ladder under there!

681
00:50:06,098 --> 00:50:08,350
Come on.

682
00:50:18,986 --> 00:50:21,530
He was right!

683
00:50:21,655 --> 00:50:23,532
He's up here!

684
00:50:23,657 --> 00:50:26,869
Doc! Better get up here fast.

685
00:50:26,994 --> 00:50:28,871
Good work, George.

686
00:50:41,884 --> 00:50:45,888
- So, is, uh, Wednesday
good for you? Say 2:00?
- Sure. Wednesday's good.

687
00:50:46,013 --> 00:50:48,557
-Should l send a car?
-No, no, John. l'll get there on my own.

688
00:50:48,682 --> 00:50:51,060
And, and l'll, l'll have somebody
from solar energy there.

689
00:50:51,185 --> 00:50:54,480
And, uh, anything else?

690
00:50:54,605 --> 00:50:58,108
Yeah, automotive. Hey, d-d-d-do you have
an agricultural school at Berkeley?

691
00:50:58,233 --> 00:51:01,487
- Yeah.
- Well, how 'bout for my fertilizer?

692
00:51:01,612 --> 00:51:03,405
l'll take care of it.

693
00:51:09,787 --> 00:51:11,246
Hey, George.

694
00:51:16,126 --> 00:51:18,379
That's the little boy's mom.

695
00:51:18,504 --> 00:51:20,547
She's the only one
who talks English, l think.

696
00:51:20,673 --> 00:51:22,967
Oh, it's too bad
she wasn't here earlier, huh?

697
00:51:23,092 --> 00:51:26,929
Yeah. But l guess
she had to look for work, man.

698
00:51:29,223 --> 00:51:31,100
l want you to meet
a very special guy.

699
00:51:31,225 --> 00:51:34,353
This is the-- This is the man
who, who found your son, okay?

700
00:51:34,478 --> 00:51:36,814
Very special.
This is George Malley.

701
00:51:36,939 --> 00:51:40,275
- This is Ella.
- Hello.

702
00:51:45,990 --> 00:51:48,492
- Thank you.
- lt's okay.

703
00:51:48,617 --> 00:51:52,162
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

704
00:51:52,288 --> 00:51:54,540
l'll take you
to the hospital, okay?

705
00:51:54,665 --> 00:51:56,292
Thanks, George.

706
00:51:59,545 --> 00:52:02,965
- Way to go, patron.
- Do you know what kind of work
she was looking for?

707
00:52:03,090 --> 00:52:05,926
Hmm, cook, l think they say.
Housekeeper.

708
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:09,513
You know somebody who's looking?

709
00:52:12,599 --> 00:52:15,227
- All right, Nate.
- Thanks, George.

710
00:52:15,352 --> 00:52:17,855
l found a housekeeper for you.
A Portuguese woman.

711
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:20,316
She cooks too.
l think she's perfect for you.

712
00:52:20,441 --> 00:52:22,318
l don't know if l could
eat Portuguese food, George.

713
00:52:22,443 --> 00:52:24,528
Well, she'll cook ya
anything you want, Nate,

714
00:52:24,653 --> 00:52:28,073
and she'll try to make sense of
that so-called house that you live in.

715
00:52:28,198 --> 00:52:31,076
- She speak English?
- Well, a bit, but, uh--

716
00:52:31,201 --> 00:52:33,370
That's what we're gonna do.
We're gonna work on your Portuguese.

717
00:52:33,495 --> 00:52:36,081
- Me?
- Yeah! You got a problem with that?

718
00:52:36,206 --> 00:52:39,460
No, no. lt's, uh-- l don't know
if that's gonna work, George.

719
00:52:39,585 --> 00:52:42,338
All right, Well, let's try it.
What do you wanna say?

720
00:52:43,922 --> 00:52:47,134
How 'bout, uh,
something like, um, um--

721
00:52:47,259 --> 00:52:50,763
- Can you come twice a week?
- Okay. Can you come twice a week?

722
00:52:50,888 --> 00:52:52,681
Okay. Can you come twice a week?

723
00:52:59,521 --> 00:53:01,774
That sounds complicated, George.

724
00:53:01,899 --> 00:53:05,986
Oh, no. You got your tape recorder, and,
and, uh, you'll learn it phonetically.

725
00:53:06,111 --> 00:53:08,447
No problem. What else?

726
00:53:08,572 --> 00:53:11,492
Uh, how much per day?

727
00:53:11,617 --> 00:53:14,495
How much per-- Oh, okay, good.
How much per day?

728
00:53:18,916 --> 00:53:22,044
- l like that one.
- Yeah? Yeah.
- That was nice. Okay. Okay.
- What else?

729
00:53:22,169 --> 00:53:26,340
Um, ah--
Can you start next week?

730
00:53:26,465 --> 00:53:29,510
- Perfect. Logical, right? Okay.
- Yeah. Yeah.

731
00:53:29,635 --> 00:53:31,178
Can you start next week?

732
00:53:34,682 --> 00:53:35,975
Beautiful language, huh?

733
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:38,227
- That's it?
- Yep. Work on those.

734
00:53:40,396 --> 00:53:43,649
You know, George,
l might be pretty good at Portuguese.

735
00:53:57,162 --> 00:54:02,251
No-- Oh, never mind.
We'll get used to 'em.

736
00:54:02,376 --> 00:54:04,962
lf you leave them alone,
they'll leave you alone.

737
00:54:05,087 --> 00:54:07,047
lt's a good arrangement.

738
00:54:07,172 --> 00:54:09,842
- What are we reading?
- This.

739
00:54:09,967 --> 00:54:11,844
What is this?
Where did you get this?

740
00:54:11,969 --> 00:54:16,807
- From me.
- This is not a good choice for bedtime.

741
00:54:16,932 --> 00:54:19,727
- Are you still mad at him?
- What's the difference?

742
00:54:19,852 --> 00:54:22,521
He's neat, and they say...

743
00:54:22,646 --> 00:54:25,190
he saved that boy's life
at the orchard.

744
00:54:25,316 --> 00:54:26,650
He's funny.

745
00:54:26,775 --> 00:54:29,445
We are funny enough.
We laugh all the time.

746
00:54:32,698 --> 00:54:35,993
Look, we're reading Black Beauty,
and we are not talking about men.

747
00:54:36,118 --> 00:54:39,872
l've got enough to worry about.
Too much.

748
00:54:39,997 --> 00:54:42,750
- What?
- Well, you guys, for one.

749
00:54:42,875 --> 00:54:44,627
We're not little any more.

750
00:54:44,752 --> 00:54:46,629
l know you're not
little any more, sweetie,

751
00:54:46,754 --> 00:54:50,633
but you think that George Malley
is safe, and you're afraid of coyotes.

752
00:54:50,758 --> 00:54:54,595
You've got it all backwards.
Here. Find our place.

753
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:57,222
Go brush your teeth.
l'll be right back.

754
00:54:57,348 --> 00:54:59,475
- Don't you have a report to do?
- Did it.

755
00:55:02,853 --> 00:55:06,440
''They're everywhere--''
Oh, Al. Do you really believe this?

756
00:55:06,565 --> 00:55:09,735
Yeah. There's been a lot of UFO people
coming into town...

757
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:14,114
since George saw what he saw.

758
00:55:14,239 --> 00:55:16,992
- The word's spreading, Ma.
- You just believe
what you wanna believe.

759
00:55:17,117 --> 00:55:19,411
Most people do.
You get over it.

760
00:55:23,582 --> 00:55:27,169
- Hey, l thought we were
getting ready for bed.
- No.

761
00:55:31,090 --> 00:55:35,636
- Stop talking about him, all right?
- Why do you hate him?

762
00:55:35,761 --> 00:55:38,681
- 'Cause l like him.
- Told you.

763
00:55:38,806 --> 00:55:40,724
Told you.

764
00:55:40,849 --> 00:55:44,687
But if he was sitting here with us
right now, wouldn't you be watching him,

765
00:55:44,812 --> 00:55:47,690
wondering, ''What's he thinking?''

766
00:55:47,815 --> 00:55:50,025
''When's he gonna leave?''

767
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:53,028
''ls he gonna leave?'' Hmm?

768
00:55:54,655 --> 00:55:56,490
We don't need that.

769
00:56:00,411 --> 00:56:02,204
lt's okay. Shh.

770
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:05,457
l heard he took 20 minutes.

771
00:56:05,582 --> 00:56:08,085
Twenty minutes, he read
the whole damn book, knew Portuguese.

772
00:56:08,210 --> 00:56:10,963
- You were there. He was too!
- And then he went
running around in the orchard.

773
00:56:11,088 --> 00:56:13,299
Shh. Here he comes. Here he comes.

774
00:56:16,135 --> 00:56:17,386
- Hey, George.
- Hello.

775
00:56:17,511 --> 00:56:21,640
- Hi.
- Hi.

776
00:56:21,765 --> 00:56:27,563
- So, George. How did you
feel that earthquake comin'?
- Voices tell ya?

777
00:56:27,688 --> 00:56:31,066
- Voices? Hell no.
- What else do you know, George?

778
00:56:32,651 --> 00:56:35,613
Well, l know you're on
the outs with Lisa again.

779
00:56:35,738 --> 00:56:37,823
- How did you know that?
- Well, 'cause when
she's livin' with you,

780
00:56:37,948 --> 00:56:39,950
she makes sure
your clothes match.

781
00:56:40,075 --> 00:56:41,910
Poor Banes.

782
00:56:42,036 --> 00:56:43,746
Do you get messages, George?

783
00:56:43,871 --> 00:56:46,415
Yeah, well, yeah, uh,
when Paulette delivers the mail l do.

784
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:48,834
But, uh, today
s-she was two hours late.

785
00:56:48,959 --> 00:56:51,086
l think we oughta
do something about that.

786
00:56:51,211 --> 00:56:53,213
Complain or somethin'.

787
00:56:53,339 --> 00:56:54,923
Earthquake, earthquake. Can we--

788
00:56:55,049 --> 00:56:56,800
Well, it-- You know, Jimmy,
it was just, uh--

789
00:56:56,925 --> 00:56:59,178
l was out by Ash Creek,
and l felt some vibrations. That's all.

790
00:56:59,303 --> 00:57:01,138
How'd you know where to find
the boy in that orchard?

791
00:57:01,263 --> 00:57:02,931
Well, l don't know, Bonnie.
l mean, come on.

792
00:57:03,057 --> 00:57:04,433
Do you know what's going to happen?

793
00:57:04,558 --> 00:57:05,517
Roger, come on!

794
00:57:05,643 --> 00:57:07,603
l'm sorry, l'm--

795
00:57:07,728 --> 00:57:10,189
They say at the library
you read four books a day now.

796
00:57:10,314 --> 00:57:12,399
Yeah, well, that was
last week and, uh--

797
00:57:17,071 --> 00:57:19,323
Ah, l-l better go.

798
00:57:19,448 --> 00:57:21,408
How many languages do you speak now?

799
00:57:21,533 --> 00:57:23,118
Excusez-moi, Jimmy.

800
00:57:23,243 --> 00:57:26,956
Huh? lf anything bad was
gonna happen, you'd tell us,

801
00:57:28,415 --> 00:57:30,626
won't ya?

802
00:57:30,751 --> 00:57:31,961
Hey!

803
00:57:35,756 --> 00:57:38,133
Uh-huh.

804
00:57:38,258 --> 00:57:41,387
- Okay. l'll be back. All right.
- All right.

805
00:57:41,512 --> 00:57:43,639
- Excuse me?
- Okay.

806
00:57:43,764 --> 00:57:45,557
Okay, thanks.

807
00:57:49,603 --> 00:57:51,397
- Hi, Lace.
- Hello.

808
00:57:57,486 --> 00:58:00,281
l'm sorry l lied to you
about the chairs.

809
00:58:02,408 --> 00:58:06,078
l-- l just wanted you to come
to my shop so, so you would talk to me,

810
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:12,251
instead of, um, instead of
always walking away from me.

811
00:58:12,376 --> 00:58:14,753
What do you want, George?

812
00:58:17,089 --> 00:58:18,966
l want you to come
to Berkeley with me.

813
00:58:19,091 --> 00:58:22,094
l-l-l've been invited
to talk to, uh, some scientists...

814
00:58:22,219 --> 00:58:25,306
about the earthquake thing
and about some of my, my experiments.

815
00:58:25,431 --> 00:58:28,475
You know, the, the fertilizer
and the solar panels and--

816
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:32,855
- That's really nice.
- l'm excited, but l--

817
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:35,858
l guess l'm scared too.

818
00:58:35,983 --> 00:58:39,278
- l sure would like you there with me.
- What for?

819
00:58:39,403 --> 00:58:44,283
Support. Confidence. A friend.

820
00:58:44,408 --> 00:58:48,120
You've got friends. You know
everyone in the whole area code.

821
00:58:48,245 --> 00:58:51,040
l don't know, you know,
since that orchard thing, it's--

822
00:58:51,165 --> 00:58:54,084
People are different now.
They're-- l don't like it.

823
00:58:54,209 --> 00:58:57,296
You know, the funny thing is,
is that you're probably the only one...

824
00:58:57,421 --> 00:59:00,633
that, that, that, that, that's mad at me
for a good reason.

825
00:59:05,387 --> 00:59:08,182
You're just trying to make up.

826
00:59:08,307 --> 00:59:12,353
Yes, l'm trying to make up with you,
l am tryin' to get a date with you,

827
00:59:12,478 --> 00:59:17,650
and l would love it if you stood
by me while all those scientists
and teachers asked me questions.

828
00:59:17,775 --> 00:59:20,486
You know, l-l-l spent
half of school in detention.

829
00:59:23,489 --> 00:59:25,240
When?

830
00:59:25,366 --> 00:59:28,202
- Wednesday.
- What time?

831
00:59:28,327 --> 00:59:33,666
- Leave about noon.
- l'll be outside your shop
at noon, if l'm coming.

832
00:59:33,791 --> 00:59:36,168
And if l'm not there--

833
00:59:36,293 --> 00:59:38,796
Okay.

834
00:59:38,921 --> 00:59:40,756
Thanks, Lace.

835
00:59:46,178 --> 00:59:51,684
Touch me in the morning

836
00:59:53,936 --> 00:59:57,356
Then just walk away

837
01:00:02,027 --> 01:00:07,491
- We don't have tomorrow
- Uh, one second.

838
01:00:07,616 --> 01:00:10,202
One second. Here l come.

839
01:00:17,126 --> 01:00:20,004
You are Mister Pope?

840
01:00:20,129 --> 01:00:23,048
You are Mister Pope?

841
01:00:23,173 --> 01:00:25,259
l am Michaela.

842
01:00:25,384 --> 01:00:29,013
M-Mich-Ella. Hmm.

843
01:00:29,138 --> 01:00:31,181
- You're Ella?
- Yes.

844
01:00:33,183 --> 01:00:35,728
Wow. Oh, l'm--
l'm sorry. Please.

845
01:00:35,853 --> 01:00:39,398
Oh. Um, maybe you need to--

846
01:00:39,523 --> 01:00:42,484
Yes, this is the place.

847
01:00:42,610 --> 01:00:46,238
- l cook too. You need cooking?
- Cookin', yeah.

848
01:00:46,363 --> 01:00:49,742
Good. Fine. Good.
Uh, how much you pay?

849
01:00:49,867 --> 01:00:50,993
Uh--

850
01:00:52,786 --> 01:00:54,580
Oh, wait, um--

851
01:00:56,290 --> 01:00:58,208
l-l-l s-s-speak
a little Portuguese.

852
01:01:07,301 --> 01:01:10,679
l don't know what you just said,
but it sounded great.

853
01:01:11,930 --> 01:01:13,432
- Um--
- Sorry.

854
01:01:13,557 --> 01:01:18,729
Okay. Uh, tomorrow
l come back. 9:00. Okay?

855
01:01:18,854 --> 01:01:21,190
l work, and we talk about money.

856
01:01:22,608 --> 01:01:24,443
No, wait.

857
01:01:30,616 --> 01:01:32,117
That's all l really know.

858
01:01:32,242 --> 01:01:34,328
That and, um--

859
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:44,672
ls that right?

860
01:01:47,049 --> 01:01:48,842
You're cute.

861
01:01:51,971 --> 01:01:53,931
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?
- Mm-hmm.

862
01:01:56,016 --> 01:01:58,102
Tomorrow, then.

863
01:02:07,194 --> 01:02:08,988
CQ. CQ?

864
01:02:11,448 --> 01:02:14,201
This is W-B-6-Q-L-F.

865
01:02:14,326 --> 01:02:18,289
Diana, if you can hear me,

866
01:02:18,414 --> 01:02:22,293
l know you'll understand this.

867
01:02:22,418 --> 01:02:23,711
l just met...

868
01:02:25,129 --> 01:02:27,673
an angel from Portugal.

869
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:33,762
Here. ln my house.

870
01:03:08,589 --> 01:03:11,133
You George Malley?

871
01:03:11,258 --> 01:03:13,552
Jack Hatch, FBl.

872
01:03:13,677 --> 01:03:17,681
Nate Pope sent a coded message
to Masterson Air Force Base.

873
01:03:17,806 --> 01:03:21,393
No, no, no, no.
Nate-- Nate Pope did not send
a coded message to the air force base.

874
01:03:21,518 --> 01:03:24,980
- l-l did.
- Well, who taught you
the cipher, Mr Malley?

875
01:03:25,105 --> 01:03:27,733
Nobody. l just broke,
broke the code.

876
01:03:27,858 --> 01:03:29,777
Who trained you?

877
01:03:29,902 --> 01:03:31,570
As l said, nobody, l--

878
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:35,074
Oh, man.

879
01:03:35,199 --> 01:03:36,533
Mm-hmm.

880
01:03:49,797 --> 01:03:50,923
Well?

881
01:03:58,555 --> 01:04:00,140
Can't do it.

882
01:04:00,265 --> 01:04:04,478
- You can do it, Mr Malley.
- Too complex.

883
01:04:09,525 --> 01:04:11,318
We're releasing Nathan Pope.

884
01:04:13,070 --> 01:04:16,407
lt's about time.
Can l talk to him?

885
01:04:16,532 --> 01:04:17,908
No.

886
01:04:19,868 --> 01:04:21,829
Try this one.

887
01:04:21,954 --> 01:04:25,332
You know, i-it was just
a game, okay? l mean, a game.

888
01:04:25,457 --> 01:04:29,211
You caused the cancellation
of a top secret training
exercise, Mr Malley.

889
01:04:29,336 --> 01:04:32,214
The scrapping of
an entire cipher system.

890
01:04:32,339 --> 01:04:35,676
You cost the government
a lot of money.

891
01:04:35,801 --> 01:04:38,178
So bill me.

892
01:04:50,941 --> 01:04:54,153
l think he's what
he says he is, a fluke.

893
01:04:54,278 --> 01:04:57,489
He's an independent,
playing some kind of genius games.

894
01:04:57,615 --> 01:04:59,992
l want him tested.

895
01:05:00,117 --> 01:05:02,328
- Can't keep holdin' him.
- Yes, we can.

896
01:05:02,453 --> 01:05:05,164
- He resisted arrest.
- No, he didn't.

897
01:05:05,289 --> 01:05:06,915
Yes, he did.

898
01:05:09,043 --> 01:05:10,502
Test him.

899
01:05:10,628 --> 01:05:13,922
All right, l'll start the questions,

900
01:05:14,048 --> 01:05:18,010
and l'll be timing your responses.

901
01:05:18,135 --> 01:05:21,013
And we'll be recording. Any questions?

902
01:05:21,138 --> 01:05:23,057
What's your first name?

903
01:05:23,182 --> 01:05:25,017
Uh, my first name is Bob.

904
01:05:27,227 --> 01:05:29,730
- Hi.
- Shoot, Bob.

905
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:31,523
Right.

906
01:05:31,649 --> 01:05:35,402
Name as many mammals
as you can in sixty seconds.

907
01:05:35,527 --> 01:05:37,404
Ready. Go.

908
01:05:37,529 --> 01:05:42,409
Hmm. Sixty seconds. Well, how would
you like that? How about alphabetical?

909
01:05:42,534 --> 01:05:44,286
Aardvark, baboon, caribou,

910
01:05:44,411 --> 01:05:47,289
dolphin, eohippus, fox,
gorilla, hyena, ibex, jackal,

911
01:05:47,414 --> 01:05:50,209
kangaroo, lion, marmoset,
Newfoundland, ocelot, panda,

912
01:05:50,334 --> 01:05:55,005
rat, sloth, tiger, unicorn,
varmint, whale, yak, zebra.

913
01:05:55,130 --> 01:05:58,926
Now, varmint is a stretch.
So is Newfoundland. That's a dog breed.

914
01:05:59,051 --> 01:06:01,095
Unicorn is mythical.
Eohippus is prehistoric.

915
01:06:01,220 --> 01:06:03,389
But you weren't being
very specific now, were you, Bob?

916
01:06:09,019 --> 01:06:11,271
Well,

917
01:06:11,397 --> 01:06:14,942
l'll-- l'll try to be more specific.

918
01:06:16,527 --> 01:06:18,445
- You ready for the next one?
- Shoot.

919
01:06:18,570 --> 01:06:24,076
Answer as quickly as you can.
How old is a person born in 1928?

920
01:06:24,201 --> 01:06:26,245
Man or woman?

921
01:06:28,372 --> 01:06:31,083
- Why?
- Specifics, Bob.

922
01:06:31,208 --> 01:06:34,086
Okay, one more time.

923
01:06:34,211 --> 01:06:37,423
How old is a man born in 1928?

924
01:06:37,548 --> 01:06:38,716
Still alive?

925
01:06:43,262 --> 01:06:47,099
lf a man is born in 1928,

926
01:06:47,224 --> 01:06:49,601
and he's still alive, how old is he?

927
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:50,936
What month?

928
01:06:52,938 --> 01:06:58,110
lf a man was born
October 3, 1928,

929
01:06:58,235 --> 01:07:00,279
and he's still alive, how old is he?

930
01:07:00,404 --> 01:07:04,033
- What time?
- 10:00.

931
01:07:04,158 --> 01:07:05,576
- P.M.
- Where?

932
01:07:05,701 --> 01:07:08,579
- Anywhere!
- Well, let's get specific, Bob.

933
01:07:08,704 --> 01:07:09,955
l mean, if the guy's still alive,

934
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:13,208
born in California,
October 3, 1928, 10:00 p.m.,

935
01:07:13,334 --> 01:07:15,961
he's 67 years, 9 months, 22 days,

936
01:07:16,086 --> 01:07:18,797
14 hours and-- and 12 minutes.

937
01:07:18,922 --> 01:07:21,967
lf he's born in New York,
he's three hours older now, isn't he?

938
01:07:38,859 --> 01:07:40,319
How do you do that?

939
01:07:43,113 --> 01:07:46,700
How do-- How do you
make that pencil move?

940
01:07:46,825 --> 01:07:49,078
ls that a trick pencil?

941
01:07:49,203 --> 01:07:52,247
No. l ask it to move.

942
01:07:52,373 --> 01:07:57,711
l mean, l could say that l will it,
but that would be more like a command.

943
01:07:57,836 --> 01:08:02,049
This is more like a collaboration,
a partnership.

944
01:08:02,174 --> 01:08:04,802
- Partnership?
- Mm-hmm.

945
01:08:04,927 --> 01:08:07,596
- With a pencil?
- Well, why not?

946
01:08:07,721 --> 01:08:10,516
We're all made up
of the same stuff, aren't we?

947
01:08:12,476 --> 01:08:16,605
- Wood?
- Energy, Bob.

948
01:08:16,730 --> 01:08:18,983
- You know, the little pieces.
- Right.

949
01:08:19,108 --> 01:08:23,279
l want to go home.
How the hell can l get home, Bob?

950
01:08:31,287 --> 01:08:33,539
l don't know. Sorry.

951
01:08:48,595 --> 01:08:49,722
Hey.

952
01:08:52,057 --> 01:08:55,436
- They say you haven't slept.
- Mmm.

953
01:08:55,561 --> 01:09:00,065
Who's that? My keepers?
l'm all right.

954
01:09:01,942 --> 01:09:04,278
You know, you're
a pretty gifted man, Mr Malley.

955
01:09:04,403 --> 01:09:08,532
No, no, really.
We were hopin'--

956
01:09:08,657 --> 01:09:10,242
Well, l was kind of hopin'...

957
01:09:10,367 --> 01:09:13,454
that you might find something
that you enjoy doin'.

958
01:09:13,579 --> 01:09:16,290
Something useful in our world.

959
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:19,126
- Your world?
- lntelligence.

960
01:09:19,251 --> 01:09:23,547
Ah, no, no, no, no.
lt's home for me, Jack.

961
01:09:23,672 --> 01:09:26,216
l'm jumpin' out
of my skin here.

962
01:09:26,342 --> 01:09:29,762
l mean, l want my life.
l want my life.

963
01:09:33,557 --> 01:09:36,769
- What do you want?
- lt's not what l want.

964
01:09:36,894 --> 01:09:39,605
What do they want?

965
01:09:39,730 --> 01:09:44,109
They want to feel safe.
They don't feel safe with you out there.

966
01:09:44,234 --> 01:09:49,615
W-W-W-Why would they? They've having me
break codes all night. Secret codes.

967
01:09:49,740 --> 01:09:53,285
l mean, there-- l shouldn't be listening
to a code from Britain to Saudi Arabia.

968
01:09:53,410 --> 01:09:57,122
l mean, these are our allies. lf-if you
guys are gonna accuse me of a crime...

969
01:09:57,247 --> 01:10:00,793
or keep me here, l'll tell the press.

970
01:10:00,918 --> 01:10:04,171
Or l'll call London or Riyadh.

971
01:10:04,296 --> 01:10:07,424
l know all the, uh,
capitals now, by the way.

972
01:10:07,549 --> 01:10:10,135
You can test me.

973
01:10:10,260 --> 01:10:14,640
My interest in Mr Malley has
to do with seismology and geology.

974
01:10:14,765 --> 01:10:17,559
lt has nothing to do
with security issues.

975
01:10:17,685 --> 01:10:19,478
Oh, l know,
but that's not the point.

976
01:10:19,603 --> 01:10:24,650
Mr Malley has been released
without charges, but he is
considered a security risk.

977
01:10:24,775 --> 01:10:27,319
l'll be frank with you.
He's an unknown quantity.

978
01:10:27,444 --> 01:10:30,489
And we'd feel better
for the time being...

979
01:10:30,614 --> 01:10:32,825
if he wasn't granted
any access to the institutions...

980
01:10:32,950 --> 01:10:35,327
where sensitive government projects
are in the works.

981
01:10:35,452 --> 01:10:38,831
- Access?
- Access even to personnel.

982
01:10:43,377 --> 01:10:45,254
- Lace?
- Ohh.

983
01:10:45,379 --> 01:10:47,172
lt's-- lt's me.

984
01:10:56,765 --> 01:10:58,517
- Hi.
- Hi.
- l'm sorry l didn't--

985
01:10:58,642 --> 01:11:01,312
l didn't come through the front door,
but l was so afraid l'd wake the kids.

986
01:11:01,437 --> 01:11:03,689
Oh, that's okay, that's okay.

987
01:11:03,814 --> 01:11:05,941
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

988
01:11:06,066 --> 01:11:08,569
l wanted to see ya.

989
01:11:08,694 --> 01:11:12,281
Nate told me about the FBl.
l'm so glad they let you go.

990
01:11:12,406 --> 01:11:17,202
Yeah, well, they had no choice, but
they, they are watching me so closely.

991
01:11:17,328 --> 01:11:19,204
l think l scare them.

992
01:11:22,499 --> 01:11:25,711
You scare me too.

993
01:11:25,836 --> 01:11:29,048
l do? Hmm.

994
01:11:34,511 --> 01:11:36,972
Listen, George, this is
getting really complicated.

995
01:11:37,097 --> 01:11:40,517
l just, uh-- l just don't know
what's going to happen next.

996
01:11:46,148 --> 01:11:48,776
l should probably
leave you alone, shouldn't l?

997
01:11:53,906 --> 01:11:55,491
l guess so.

998
01:12:05,167 --> 01:12:06,585
l'll see ya.

999
01:12:07,878 --> 01:12:09,213
Bye.

1000
01:12:24,603 --> 01:12:25,938
Hey.

1001
01:12:26,063 --> 01:12:28,440
- You want a beer, George?
- Yep.

1002
01:12:30,234 --> 01:12:33,404
Look, Nate--

1003
01:12:33,529 --> 01:12:36,824
l am really sorry
for what happened, okay?

1004
01:12:36,949 --> 01:12:40,286
l told them everything, George.

1005
01:12:40,411 --> 01:12:43,247
l told them
everything about you.

1006
01:12:43,372 --> 01:12:44,748
Everything.

1007
01:12:44,873 --> 01:12:47,459
Well, you know, that's
supposed to happen, okay?

1008
01:12:47,584 --> 01:12:50,796
- l mean, you know, it's, uh--
- You just think you're
not going to be so scared,

1009
01:12:50,921 --> 01:12:55,092
and you're sittin' there--
you don't know what's gonna happen,
then all of a sudden...

1010
01:12:55,217 --> 01:12:57,970
somethin' happens inside you, right?

1011
01:12:58,095 --> 01:13:00,097
And you don't know what it is, but--

1012
01:13:00,222 --> 01:13:03,017
lt's all right.
l-l-lt was my game, you know?

1013
01:13:09,523 --> 01:13:11,317
What'd they do to you, George?

1014
01:13:12,943 --> 01:13:15,946
They tested me.

1015
01:13:16,071 --> 01:13:18,449
What did they find out?

1016
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:24,955
- l'm pregnant. That's how it feels.
- How what feels?

1017
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:28,417
Yeah, you know, to be full of ideas
and you can't deliver, okay?

1018
01:13:28,542 --> 01:13:31,420
l mean, you know, you're ready
to break out and you can't deliver.

1019
01:13:31,545 --> 01:13:33,339
You know, uh, this professor,
he won't even talk to me.

1020
01:13:33,464 --> 01:13:35,924
He won't even talk to me.

1021
01:13:36,050 --> 01:13:38,636
- You're not going to Berkeley, George?
- Oh, come on. Me, at Berkeley?

1022
01:13:38,761 --> 01:13:42,890
- That's a thought, huh?
- l'm sorry, buddy.

1023
01:13:43,015 --> 01:13:44,892
You mean, inventions?
You got inventions?

1024
01:13:45,017 --> 01:13:49,021
No, no. ldeas, okay? l get a thousand
ideas a day, every d-damn minute. Okay?

1025
01:13:49,146 --> 01:13:53,525
l got big, big, ''holy cow''
kind of ideas and, and little
''what if'' ideas. All right?

1026
01:13:53,651 --> 01:13:55,736
Hey, l got ideas for you, Jimmy.
Look at this.

1027
01:13:55,861 --> 01:13:57,738
Look at this. Your parking lot--
it's laid out all wrong, okay?

1028
01:13:57,863 --> 01:13:59,865
Now, if you just
follow this, right,

1029
01:13:59,990 --> 01:14:03,160
you can put six more cars in and
nobody gets fender benders. All right?

1030
01:14:03,285 --> 01:14:07,706
Where's Paulette?
Where is she? Bonnie, here. Take this.
This is a new route for our mail. Okay?

1031
01:14:07,831 --> 01:14:09,917
Now, if she does this,
she can save an hour a day...

1032
01:14:10,042 --> 01:14:12,503
and everybody gets their mail
by 3:00. lmagine, 3:00.

1033
01:14:12,628 --> 01:14:15,255
Oh, and l got a ''holy shit'' idea too.
Look at this.

1034
01:14:15,381 --> 01:14:18,759
Now this may be the most efficient way
to store solar energy. Okay? Take it.

1035
01:14:18,884 --> 01:14:22,554
- Well, what am l gonna do with it?
- What the hell am l supposed
to do with it, huh?

1036
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:24,723
You know what that light was?
You know what that sound was?

1037
01:14:24,848 --> 01:14:26,684
-Tell us.
-l'm gonna tell you what it was.
-Well, tell us!

1038
01:14:26,809 --> 01:14:29,228
- lt was a damn alien.
- Don't say that.
You don't know what it was.

1039
01:14:29,353 --> 01:14:31,855
- l know what it is, Nate.
- You don't know what it was.
Don't say that.

1040
01:14:31,981 --> 01:14:34,441
- Well, tell us!
- lt's a goddam mistake,
is what it is!

1041
01:14:34,566 --> 01:14:39,697
Okay? lt was supposed
to happen to someone smart, someone
scientific, someone who's a leader.

1042
01:14:39,822 --> 01:14:42,408
But it didn't. lt happened
to me, George freakin' Malley.

1043
01:14:42,533 --> 01:14:44,743
Look at him. Now look at him. Look!

1044
01:14:51,333 --> 01:14:52,459
Jimmy?

1045
01:14:54,586 --> 01:14:56,505
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1046
01:14:58,465 --> 01:15:01,051
- l'm sorry.
- No, it's all right.

1047
01:15:01,176 --> 01:15:04,930
- l-l-l'll pay for it.
- All right.

1048
01:15:05,055 --> 01:15:09,101
Bonnie. Bonnie, please.
l-l-lt's ok--

1049
01:15:10,728 --> 01:15:12,021
Oh, man.

1050
01:15:24,199 --> 01:15:27,161
Mm-hmm.

1051
01:15:27,286 --> 01:15:28,746
Okay.

1052
01:15:28,871 --> 01:15:30,706
Who was that? Customer?

1053
01:15:33,083 --> 01:15:36,337
lt's Banes.
Says he can't work here no more.

1054
01:15:36,462 --> 01:15:38,714
Sorry.

1055
01:15:38,839 --> 01:15:41,133
Why didn't he talk to me?

1056
01:15:41,258 --> 01:15:43,344
- A little bit scared, l guess.
- Jesus Christ.

1057
01:15:43,469 --> 01:15:46,096
Look, George, it'll wear off.

1058
01:15:46,221 --> 01:15:48,849
They'll forget.
Their cars are gonna break down--

1059
01:15:48,974 --> 01:15:50,809
- Hi.
- Hey, Doc.

1060
01:15:50,934 --> 01:15:52,227
Hi.

1061
01:15:55,648 --> 01:15:57,566
- Energy vibrations. What is it?
- l don't know.

1062
01:15:57,691 --> 01:16:00,486
- T-- Telekinesis? What? What?
- Yeah, maybe. Uh, maybe, yeah.

1063
01:16:00,611 --> 01:16:01,904
You think it's gettin' out of hand?

1064
01:16:02,029 --> 01:16:03,697
Well, look, you know,
l was, l was mad, all right?

1065
01:16:03,822 --> 01:16:05,950
l was pissed off,
and l'm not mad now, okay?

1066
01:16:06,075 --> 01:16:10,204
Good. l'll sound the all-clear,
call off the paratroopers.

1067
01:16:10,329 --> 01:16:13,165
Jesus, George. Now, listen.

1068
01:16:13,290 --> 01:16:16,377
- You owe me a CAT scan.
l want more blood.
- Mm-hmm.

1069
01:16:16,502 --> 01:16:19,672
- Also, you look like hell.
- Ah, that's good.

1070
01:16:19,797 --> 01:16:21,674
Doc, what's the matter
with everybody?

1071
01:16:21,799 --> 01:16:23,634
They won't give me a chance
to explain anything.

1072
01:16:23,759 --> 01:16:25,094
l look at them--
l look at them, and they--

1073
01:16:25,219 --> 01:16:27,888
they look at me like
l'm a green bug or something.

1074
01:16:28,013 --> 01:16:30,224
- Give them some time, George.
- Now, look, l have an idea.

1075
01:16:30,349 --> 01:16:32,226
Now, you look at this.
Now, look at this.

1076
01:16:32,351 --> 01:16:35,562
Now, now, look at that. Now, l-l-l'm
a big deal at the Harmon Library.

1077
01:16:35,688 --> 01:16:38,524
l can, l can take up to 30 books
a night, okay, and l told them
l'd be part of this.

1078
01:16:38,649 --> 01:16:40,693
l said that l-l-l would put out
a table and...

1079
01:16:40,818 --> 01:16:42,861
- Your pressure is way up now.
- and l would sit there and
people could ask me questions.

1080
01:16:42,987 --> 01:16:45,197
You know, meet George Malley.
What do you think?

1081
01:16:45,322 --> 01:16:47,199
Uh, like a circus attraction.

1082
01:16:47,324 --> 01:16:48,826
Oh, God, Doc, please.

1083
01:16:48,951 --> 01:16:50,703
- Yeah.
- You know, l, uh--

1084
01:16:50,828 --> 01:16:52,830
You see, l c-c-can explain
to them once and for all.

1085
01:16:52,955 --> 01:16:54,707
l-l could share
my ideas with them,

1086
01:16:54,832 --> 01:16:56,709
you know, and then l-l-l
could get my life back together.

1087
01:16:56,834 --> 01:16:59,878
Come see me for that scan.
Take it easy on sugar and salt.

1088
01:17:00,004 --> 01:17:04,883
Okay? And do like l told you all your
life. Breathe in and out. Okay, George?

1089
01:17:05,009 --> 01:17:06,969
Yeah.

1090
01:18:30,469 --> 01:18:32,388
- Come on. Give it!
- No.

1091
01:18:32,513 --> 01:18:35,265
- Give it. Come on!
- No!
- You're not careful. You'll break it.

1092
01:18:35,391 --> 01:18:37,768
- Al, what do ya got there?
- Please, l just wanna look at it.

1093
01:18:43,983 --> 01:18:46,777
Hey. That's dangerous, sweetie.

1094
01:18:46,902 --> 01:18:49,655
- He bought it.
- What?

1095
01:18:49,780 --> 01:18:51,323
lt's a piece of
the mirror George broke.

1096
01:18:51,448 --> 01:18:52,825
Richard Smick is
selling them at school.

1097
01:18:52,950 --> 01:18:55,202
- Oh, you're kidding.
- lt's hot! Feel it.

1098
01:18:55,327 --> 01:18:57,288
lt's not hot.

1099
01:18:57,413 --> 01:19:00,499
Richard said the aliens probably
took George Malley away...

1100
01:19:00,624 --> 01:19:03,085
and put this man in his place.

1101
01:19:03,210 --> 01:19:06,130
- This man?
- Like he's not human.

1102
01:19:06,255 --> 01:19:08,757
That's really dumb,
and it's really mean.

1103
01:19:10,968 --> 01:19:15,597
Can't they just look in his eyes
and see who he is? Can't you?

1104
01:19:15,723 --> 01:19:19,435
Do you remember, when daddy left,
how people treated us differently?

1105
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:22,146
Even our so-called friends.

1106
01:19:24,106 --> 01:19:27,234
Remember how much it hurt?
You don't do that to people.

1107
01:19:30,821 --> 01:19:32,364
How much you pay for that?

1108
01:19:32,489 --> 01:19:36,118
- A quarter.
- A dollar.
- What's the truth, Al?

1109
01:19:36,243 --> 01:19:40,748
l paid a dollar.
l was gonna check it with my magnets.

1110
01:19:40,873 --> 01:19:42,041
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

1111
01:19:42,166 --> 01:19:44,793
Do you see something
really strange in there?

1112
01:19:44,918 --> 01:19:46,920
- What?
- What?

1113
01:19:47,046 --> 01:19:48,881
A sucker.

1114
01:19:50,841 --> 01:19:53,218
- No.
- You paid a dollar for nothing.

1115
01:19:53,344 --> 01:19:55,554
- You're a goner.
- Nice job, Al.

1116
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:17,576
Hmm.

1117
01:20:23,582 --> 01:20:26,460
Lace.

1118
01:20:26,585 --> 01:20:27,920
Hi.

1119
01:20:29,546 --> 01:20:30,798
Hi.

1120
01:20:32,049 --> 01:20:33,717
l just-- l just called you.

1121
01:20:33,842 --> 01:20:37,972
- You did?
- Mmm. Come in, come in.

1122
01:20:44,687 --> 01:20:47,398
l'm so, so glad you came.

1123
01:20:47,523 --> 01:20:49,608
Well, l was just--

1124
01:20:49,733 --> 01:20:52,444
W-Why-- Why were you calling?

1125
01:20:52,569 --> 01:20:55,447
l found some things out, Lace.

1126
01:20:55,572 --> 01:20:58,701
Things, uh, are coming clearer to me.

1127
01:20:58,826 --> 01:21:01,662
Or, at least,
they're, they're starting to.

1128
01:21:01,787 --> 01:21:04,623
- Things?
- Mmm.

1129
01:21:04,748 --> 01:21:06,959
l wanna talk to the people, Lace.

1130
01:21:07,084 --> 01:21:09,295
l-l don't want them to be scared of me
or, or frightened.

1131
01:21:09,420 --> 01:21:14,466
l-- l mean, l wanna,
l wanna tell them what l know.

1132
01:21:14,591 --> 01:21:17,428
So l've, l've decided
to speak at the library fair.

1133
01:21:19,221 --> 01:21:22,016
Do-- Do you think that
they'll listen to me?

1134
01:21:24,143 --> 01:21:27,479
What would they do, throw stones?

1135
01:21:29,815 --> 01:21:32,901
Oh, my God, please sit down.
l can't believe this.

1136
01:21:33,027 --> 01:21:35,362
Would you like something
to drink? A beer.

1137
01:21:35,487 --> 01:21:38,532
- No.
- What? What can l get you?

1138
01:21:41,118 --> 01:21:42,953
Scissors.

1139
01:21:43,078 --> 01:21:46,415
l can hear her heart beat

1140
01:21:46,540 --> 01:21:50,502
From a thousand miles

1141
01:21:50,628 --> 01:21:56,842
And the heavens open up
every time she smiles

1142
01:21:58,302 --> 01:22:04,725
And when l come to her
that is where l belong

1143
01:22:04,850 --> 01:22:11,857
And l'm runnin' through her
like a river song

1144
01:22:11,982 --> 01:22:18,989
She gives me love, love
love, love, crazy love

1145
01:22:19,114 --> 01:22:25,704
She gives me love, love
love, love, crazy love

1146
01:22:27,373 --> 01:22:34,546
She's got a fine sense of humour
when l'm feelin' low down

1147
01:22:34,672 --> 01:22:39,843
And l'm comin' to her
when the sun goes down

1148
01:22:41,720 --> 01:22:48,978
Take away my troubles
Oh, take away my grief

1149
01:22:49,103 --> 01:22:55,067
Take away my heartaches
in the night like a thief

1150
01:22:55,192 --> 01:23:02,366
She gives me love, love
love, love, crazy love

1151
01:23:02,491 --> 01:23:10,916
She gives me love, love
love, love, crazy love

1152
01:23:11,041 --> 01:23:15,587
And l need her in the daytime

1153
01:23:15,713 --> 01:23:18,590
l need her

1154
01:23:18,716 --> 01:23:22,761
And l need her in the night

1155
01:23:22,886 --> 01:23:25,264
l need her

1156
01:23:25,389 --> 01:23:30,811
And l wanna throw
my arms around her

1157
01:23:30,936 --> 01:23:33,272
- Have you done this before?
- And kiss and hug her
- Nope.

1158
01:23:33,397 --> 01:23:37,067
- Hmm.
- And kiss and hug her tight

1159
01:23:43,157 --> 01:23:47,077
- Up or down.
- When l'm returning
- Down.

1160
01:23:47,202 --> 01:23:50,164
From so far away

1161
01:23:50,289 --> 01:23:53,709
Give me some sweet lovin'

1162
01:23:53,834 --> 01:23:57,880
lt brightens up my day

1163
01:23:58,005 --> 01:24:00,591
And it makes me righteous

1164
01:24:00,716 --> 01:24:04,386
And it makes me whole

1165
01:24:04,511 --> 01:24:11,101
And it makes me mellow
right down to my soul

1166
01:24:11,226 --> 01:24:18,317
She gives me love, love
love, love, crazy love

1167
01:24:18,442 --> 01:24:26,075
She gives me love, love
love, love, crazy love

1168
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:28,661
ls it close enough?

1169
01:24:30,037 --> 01:24:31,330
You tell me.

1170
01:24:33,248 --> 01:24:37,169
You give me love
Give me love

1171
01:24:37,294 --> 01:24:40,339
- Crazy love
- Uh, it's pretty close.

1172
01:24:40,464 --> 01:24:47,388
Love, love, love,
love, crazy love

1173
01:24:47,513 --> 01:24:53,852
You give me love, love
love, love, crazy love

1174
01:24:57,690 --> 01:24:59,775
You're running away?

1175
01:25:03,445 --> 01:25:05,239
Are you comin' back?

1176
01:25:11,745 --> 01:25:12,871
Hmm.

1177
01:25:16,917 --> 01:25:18,711
Hope so.

1178
01:25:46,739 --> 01:25:48,574
- Okay, George?
- Huh-huh.

1179
01:25:58,083 --> 01:26:00,210
Oh, hi, Doc.

1180
01:26:00,336 --> 01:26:03,380
- Welcome.
- Do you improve your mind
with all this reading?

1181
01:26:03,505 --> 01:26:05,382
Yes, Doc.

1182
01:26:05,507 --> 01:26:07,551
Lady Chatterly's Lover?

1183
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:12,932
Yeah, well-- All right, well,
you know, that's kind of, uh--

1184
01:26:13,057 --> 01:26:16,101
that's kind of a code book for anyone
who, uh, wants to understand...

1185
01:26:16,226 --> 01:26:18,103
a woman's heart and mind.

1186
01:26:18,228 --> 01:26:22,274
- l read it twice.
- Ah, George, can you, uh--

1187
01:26:22,399 --> 01:26:25,611
can you name the presidents
forwards and backwards for these people?

1188
01:26:25,736 --> 01:26:29,281
No, but l can name some, uh, forward
presidents and some backward ones.

1189
01:26:31,492 --> 01:26:34,119
You know, l-l can really only tell you
what l've read in these books and, uh--

1190
01:26:34,244 --> 01:26:39,041
- He looks better.
- Yeah, yeah he does.
- you know, things l'm thinking about.

1191
01:26:39,166 --> 01:26:42,044
l seem to have an increased capacity
for, for learning right now.

1192
01:26:42,169 --> 01:26:46,966
- How do we know
you read all these books?
- Well, um, ask me something.

1193
01:26:47,091 --> 01:26:50,636
Uh, l'd be, l'll be glad to answer
any question that you have, or a--

1194
01:26:50,761 --> 01:26:55,432
How did you break that mirror, George,
without even touching it?

1195
01:26:55,557 --> 01:26:57,810
Now, l wanna talk
to you about that, Banes,

1196
01:26:57,935 --> 01:27:01,605
because l know, l know
you've been worried about it, and, um--

1197
01:27:01,730 --> 01:27:04,566
Okay, come here. Come here.
Everybody gather closely.

1198
01:27:04,692 --> 01:27:06,652
l'm gonna-- May l use your glasses?

1199
01:27:09,446 --> 01:27:11,073
What you're about to see
is not a trick.

1200
01:27:11,198 --> 01:27:14,868
Okay? lt-- lt's just, um--
Well l-l-let's call it
an experiment in energy.

1201
01:27:14,994 --> 01:27:16,954
- Oh!
- Cool.

1202
01:27:17,079 --> 01:27:18,831
- Well, everything there is...
- Are you getting this?

1203
01:27:18,956 --> 01:27:21,375
is made up of
some living energy, okay?

1204
01:27:21,500 --> 01:27:26,297
See, now, all this is is a-- is kind
of a dance, or a partnership between...

1205
01:27:26,422 --> 01:27:30,175
the energy coming from me
and the, uh, energy of the plastic.

1206
01:27:30,301 --> 01:27:33,345
- Now, now, tha-tha-that's it, see.
- Well, why can't we do it?

1207
01:27:33,470 --> 01:27:38,142
Well, focus, um, the clarity
of thought. l-l don't know.

1208
01:27:38,267 --> 01:27:39,560
M-May-Maybe you can, Banes.

1209
01:27:39,685 --> 01:27:41,604
What about the UFOs?
What are they?

1210
01:27:41,729 --> 01:27:45,441
- l don't know that either.
- Yes, you do. Yes, you do!

1211
01:27:45,566 --> 01:27:49,653
Um, this power began the night
that you saw the object in the sky?

1212
01:27:49,778 --> 01:27:51,071
T-T-That was a light.

1213
01:27:51,196 --> 01:27:53,282
Now, now, let me, let me
just finish this one thing.

1214
01:27:53,407 --> 01:27:55,492
Now, now, we were talking
about a partnership.

1215
01:27:55,618 --> 01:28:00,539
Now, do you, do you know what the
largest living organism in the world is?

1216
01:28:00,664 --> 01:28:05,085
Okay, it's a-- it's a grove of aspen
trees in Colorado. Acres of aspens.

1217
01:28:05,210 --> 01:28:07,713
Okay, now, they thought
they were disconnected, separate,

1218
01:28:07,838 --> 01:28:09,548
but indeed they found out
that they weren't,

1219
01:28:09,673 --> 01:28:13,177
that, that there was one giant organism
with the same root system.

1220
01:28:13,302 --> 01:28:16,347
What sort of light was it?

1221
01:28:16,472 --> 01:28:18,724
- Now, that-that's not unlike us.
- Answer the question!

1222
01:28:18,849 --> 01:28:21,060
- We, we think that we're disconnected,
- Why won't you tell us what
you know about the UFOs?

1223
01:28:21,185 --> 01:28:24,063
- Can you move a table?
- but, you know, we're--
- How did you feel
when you saw that light?

1224
01:28:24,188 --> 01:28:27,441
- l think you know more
than you're telling us.
- We're not. Now imagine--
imagine, if you will--

1225
01:28:27,566 --> 01:28:30,861
Have you seen the light since
the 28th, or any other activity?

1226
01:28:30,986 --> 01:28:33,572
- Are you hiding something?
- Hey, hey. Hey, come on!

1227
01:28:33,697 --> 01:28:36,075
- Just put your hands on my boy.
- lt was aliens. Admit it!

1228
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:38,369
- Move the glasses some more.
- Can you bend spoons?

1229
01:28:38,494 --> 01:28:40,746
- Now, we all know what you can do.
- Hey, leave George alone.

1230
01:28:40,871 --> 01:28:44,917
- Why won't you touch the boy?
- Please, he's dying. Just do it.

1231
01:28:45,042 --> 01:28:46,710
George! George!

1232
01:28:52,925 --> 01:28:56,345
George? George, can you see me?

1233
01:28:56,470 --> 01:28:59,223
George. George, are you okay?

1234
01:29:14,863 --> 01:29:16,907
Mr Malley? Are you all right?

1235
01:29:51,775 --> 01:29:55,487
- You look sorrowful.
- No.

1236
01:29:55,613 --> 01:29:59,700
What's the matter? Can't think
of any more tests to give me?

1237
01:29:59,825 --> 01:30:03,829
How did you, uh, manage to get
your pressure to come down?

1238
01:30:03,954 --> 01:30:06,790
Oh, l found my pace.

1239
01:30:06,915 --> 01:30:08,792
A simple thing, really.

1240
01:30:08,917 --> 01:30:12,338
- Hard to explain.
- What, you figure l'm too thick?

1241
01:30:12,463 --> 01:30:15,174
What l figure about you...

1242
01:30:15,299 --> 01:30:18,052
is that you're stalling.

1243
01:30:18,177 --> 01:30:22,306
l'm not stalling, no.
l'm-l'm waiting.

1244
01:30:22,431 --> 01:30:25,935
- For what?
- Reinforcements.

1245
01:30:33,525 --> 01:30:37,571
Well, you pick good people.

1246
01:30:37,696 --> 01:30:39,531
You bet.

1247
01:30:43,035 --> 01:30:44,870
See--

1248
01:30:46,163 --> 01:30:47,957
George. George.

1249
01:30:50,250 --> 01:30:53,504
There's a tumor in your brain...

1250
01:30:53,629 --> 01:30:55,589
that's spread out like a hand.

1251
01:30:55,714 --> 01:30:57,883
Threads of it, you know, everywhere.

1252
01:30:58,008 --> 01:31:01,011
But instead of dysfunction--
Now, here's the mystery, George.

1253
01:31:01,136 --> 01:31:05,182
lnstead of destroying
brain function,

1254
01:31:05,307 --> 01:31:09,853
so far it's been stimulating it,
and we can't understand that.

1255
01:31:09,979 --> 01:31:14,733
You have more area of active brain use
than anybody ever tested, ever,

1256
01:31:14,858 --> 01:31:17,069
b-because of those tentacles.

1257
01:31:17,194 --> 01:31:19,071
l mean, we've seen tumors
like this before.

1258
01:31:19,196 --> 01:31:27,121
lt's called astrocytoma, and
it explains, uh, the dizziness and...

1259
01:31:27,246 --> 01:31:29,748
the illusion of light.

1260
01:31:29,873 --> 01:31:33,252
But the way it's in there,
waking up areas of the brain,

1261
01:31:33,377 --> 01:31:35,170
it's a...

1262
01:31:37,881 --> 01:31:40,551
big mystery, so--

1263
01:31:41,802 --> 01:31:44,013
And it's killing me.

1264
01:31:44,138 --> 01:31:45,514
- Well, uh--
- For sure?

1265
01:31:49,810 --> 01:31:51,770
We got a call from
the best brain man in the country.

1266
01:31:51,895 --> 01:31:54,273
l mean, actually,
he's one of the best in the world.

1267
01:31:54,398 --> 01:31:58,277
- He's gonna study your tests
and then talk to you.
- Hmm.

1268
01:31:58,402 --> 01:32:02,948
But, uh, the blood flow
is in danger now,

1269
01:32:03,073 --> 01:32:06,035
and, uh, you're gonna
start to weaken, maybe...

1270
01:32:07,911 --> 01:32:10,456
black out.

1271
01:32:10,581 --> 01:32:16,378
We, we really don't know. lt's, it's--
But it's a damn lousy scenario, you see.

1272
01:32:21,008 --> 01:32:23,802
Let me sit down here a minute.

1273
01:32:28,599 --> 01:32:30,809
Goddam it.

1274
01:32:32,561 --> 01:32:34,647
Something happened
about 25 years ago...

1275
01:32:34,772 --> 01:32:37,316
when you broke your leg
and l set it, George.

1276
01:32:37,441 --> 01:32:40,235
l don't know what to call it,
but, uh,

1277
01:32:40,361 --> 01:32:44,865
somehow you got into
my heart more than most,

1278
01:32:44,990 --> 01:32:46,825
and for--

1279
01:32:50,496 --> 01:32:52,957
and for a man
who's never been a father,

1280
01:32:53,082 --> 01:32:55,167
l sure feel like
l'm losin' a son.

1281
01:32:56,752 --> 01:32:58,504
Yeah.

1282
01:33:00,506 --> 01:33:02,967
Georgie.

1283
01:33:03,092 --> 01:33:04,510
Yeah.

1284
01:33:10,307 --> 01:33:13,727
Can l do something for you,
George? Anything?

1285
01:33:13,852 --> 01:33:19,191
Yes. Next spring,
when you plant the south 40,

1286
01:33:19,316 --> 01:33:22,236
l want you to use
the new fertilizer.

1287
01:33:22,361 --> 01:33:24,697
- l want you to put corn in that field,
and l know what you're thinking--
- l can't put corn in there.

1288
01:33:24,822 --> 01:33:28,284
You're thinking that
it's too tough a crop, but it's not.

1289
01:33:28,409 --> 01:33:32,705
l'm telling you. You'll get
four to five years without rotation.

1290
01:33:32,830 --> 01:33:34,915
Now, trust me on this.

1291
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:36,875
Hey.

1292
01:33:39,128 --> 01:33:42,548
- l'm gonna wait outside.
- Okay.

1293
01:33:42,673 --> 01:33:44,925
Doc, you wanna come with me?

1294
01:33:45,050 --> 01:33:46,885
Yeah.

1295
01:33:49,888 --> 01:33:51,724
Bye, Doc.

1296
01:34:00,733 --> 01:34:05,571
Now, uh, he didn't say how long.

1297
01:34:09,408 --> 01:34:13,787
Days or weeks.
They don't-- They don't know.

1298
01:34:14,997 --> 01:34:16,790
l'm so sorry, Lace.

1299
01:34:20,294 --> 01:34:21,962
l know how you hate surprises.

1300
01:34:23,505 --> 01:34:26,133
l tried so hard not to love you.

1301
01:34:26,258 --> 01:34:28,218
- How'd you make out?
- Terrible.

1302
01:34:32,848 --> 01:34:37,186
Hey, would you, uh,
love me the rest of my life?

1303
01:34:37,311 --> 01:34:41,273
No, l'm gonna love you
for the rest of mine.

1304
01:35:06,090 --> 01:35:09,510
George Malley?
l'm Dr Wellin.

1305
01:35:11,345 --> 01:35:12,972
George, l'm recording this because...

1306
01:35:13,097 --> 01:35:17,059
l'm going to be asking you
some very important questions.

1307
01:35:17,184 --> 01:35:19,979
- You ready?
- Not another test?

1308
01:35:20,104 --> 01:35:23,274
No. No, no. No more tests.

1309
01:35:24,692 --> 01:35:27,194
A dialogue.

1310
01:35:27,319 --> 01:35:32,366
l'm going to ask for your permission for
my team to perform open brain surgery.

1311
01:35:32,491 --> 01:35:36,245
But l don't want you to answer
'til we've had our dialogue, all right?

1312
01:35:36,370 --> 01:35:39,081
Bu-But you s-s-said that
this tumor was inoperable.

1313
01:35:39,206 --> 01:35:43,544
l think the odds are very small,
say one in five hundred,

1314
01:35:43,669 --> 01:35:46,964
that we'd be able to remove enough
of the tumor to even prolong your life.

1315
01:35:47,089 --> 01:35:50,342
- Well, why, why--
- But, but what l want to explain is...

1316
01:35:50,467 --> 01:35:54,847
that this would not be
a lifesaving operation.

1317
01:35:54,972 --> 01:35:56,807
This would be--

1318
01:35:58,100 --> 01:36:00,102
Call it an expedition.

1319
01:36:01,854 --> 01:36:05,524
This would be
a voyage of discovery.

1320
01:36:05,649 --> 01:36:08,777
You're in a position to contribute
as much to our knowledge...

1321
01:36:08,902 --> 01:36:11,322
as any man or woman
who's come before you.

1322
01:36:14,116 --> 01:36:16,201
And if you were
to wait, and, uh,

1323
01:36:16,327 --> 01:36:19,913
do this operation after l'm done
with my brain, what, what would, uh--

1324
01:36:20,039 --> 01:36:23,959
lf that's what you want,
yes, an autopsy, that's all we'll do.

1325
01:36:24,084 --> 01:36:25,419
But it wouldn't be as useful?

1326
01:36:25,544 --> 01:36:30,049
The study of a living,
active brain would tell us volumes.

1327
01:36:30,174 --> 01:36:31,634
All right, so if you were
to do this operation,

1328
01:36:31,759 --> 01:36:35,137
wouldn't it most likely kill me
or at least shorten my life?

1329
01:36:35,262 --> 01:36:40,893
-George, l-l'm asking you to try
and see the larger picture.
-Mm-hmm.

1330
01:36:41,018 --> 01:36:46,065
To realize what you have to offer to us,
the ones you're leaving behind.

1331
01:36:46,190 --> 01:36:50,778
You could be
our greatest teacher, George. Hmm?

1332
01:36:50,903 --> 01:36:54,490
l can be your biographer,
in a sense.

1333
01:36:54,615 --> 01:36:57,284
l can present you to the world.

1334
01:36:57,409 --> 01:37:01,789
But that's not me.
That's just my brain. Do you understand?

1335
01:37:01,914 --> 01:37:06,168
Look, Doctor, you know,
l just might have something
to say in my last few hours.

1336
01:37:06,293 --> 01:37:08,837
l-l just might have
something to say.

1337
01:37:08,963 --> 01:37:11,632
What you're saying is that
l have something to teach,

1338
01:37:11,757 --> 01:37:15,177
and yet you're willing to end me
to study my brain under a microscope.

1339
01:37:15,302 --> 01:37:17,471
- N-Now, is that all l'm here for?
- What else?

1340
01:37:17,596 --> 01:37:19,682
- You're not a scholar or a think--
- l-l-l'll tell you what l am, okay?

1341
01:37:19,807 --> 01:37:21,350
l'll tell you what l think l am.

1342
01:37:21,475 --> 01:37:22,851
l think l'm what everybody can be.

1343
01:37:22,977 --> 01:37:24,770
Everyone with
a malignant, tentacled--

1344
01:37:24,895 --> 01:37:29,233
No, no, no, no. lt's-- lt's--
Tha-tha-that just helped me
get here, okay?

1345
01:37:29,358 --> 01:37:30,693
l mean, anybody can get here.

1346
01:37:30,818 --> 01:37:35,656
lt's-- l'm-- l'm
the possibility, all right?

1347
01:37:35,781 --> 01:37:38,534
l mean, l think you've got this
desperate grasp on, uh, technology...

1348
01:37:38,659 --> 01:37:42,913
and this grasp on science, and,
uh, you don't have a-a hand left
to grasp what's important.

1349
01:37:43,038 --> 01:37:44,915
- George. Now, George--
- lf l had to choose between
a tumor that got me here...

1350
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:48,460
and some flash of light from
an alien craft, l'd choose the tumor.

1351
01:37:48,585 --> 01:37:50,796
l would, because
it's here, within us.

1352
01:37:50,921 --> 01:37:53,549
What l'm talking about
is the human spirit.

1353
01:37:53,674 --> 01:37:58,387
That's the challenge. That's the voyage.
That's the expedition.

1354
01:38:01,974 --> 01:38:04,435
You need to go now.

1355
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:08,772
l need my rest,
and, uh, l wanna go home.

1356
01:38:28,125 --> 01:38:31,712
Hey, hey, hey. l tried to release
my patient. Now, what's going on?

1357
01:38:31,837 --> 01:38:33,255
- lt's done
- What's done?
- We didn't feel...

1358
01:38:33,380 --> 01:38:35,799
George Malley was
competent to make the decision.

1359
01:38:35,924 --> 01:38:37,801
He's a surgical patient now.

1360
01:38:37,927 --> 01:38:40,387
Oh, what did you tell the judge?
That you could save him?

1361
01:38:40,512 --> 01:38:42,514
l might prolong his life, yes.

1362
01:38:42,640 --> 01:38:43,933
Bullshit.

1363
01:38:44,058 --> 01:38:46,101
lf he were rational, he'd say yes.

1364
01:38:46,226 --> 01:38:47,895
You know he would.

1365
01:38:48,020 --> 01:38:50,147
Now l know why you guys wear masks.

1366
01:38:56,070 --> 01:38:58,572
Yeah, if it was light enough,
he could've been blowing
on it with his breath.

1367
01:38:58,697 --> 01:39:00,491
You know, he could
have had a string.

1368
01:39:00,616 --> 01:39:04,036
So thin, you know, like, uh, catgut.

1369
01:39:04,161 --> 01:39:07,289
l mean, he could've had it
on his finger and on the glasses
and he could have made it move that way.

1370
01:39:07,414 --> 01:39:11,418
Don't you think he, he could've
uh, thrown s-somethin'
at that mirror somehow?

1371
01:39:11,543 --> 01:39:13,796
- We-We just didn't see it?
- No way.

1372
01:39:13,921 --> 01:39:16,215
That quake could've
been a coincidence.

1373
01:39:16,340 --> 01:39:20,052
He just thought he knew stuff.
l mean s-s-- he just studied
harder on the Spanish.

1374
01:39:20,177 --> 01:39:22,596
That's all. lt's not like
he really knew stuff.

1375
01:39:22,721 --> 01:39:26,558
Just studied hard at chess
and made us think he was changin', but--

1376
01:39:26,684 --> 01:39:28,519
You know, he never
really changed at all.

1377
01:39:28,644 --> 01:39:30,187
Ain't that right, Doc?

1378
01:39:30,312 --> 01:39:33,607
l mean, he never
really got any smarter.

1379
01:39:33,732 --> 01:39:35,150
Doc?

1380
01:39:35,276 --> 01:39:37,403
Banes?

1381
01:39:38,612 --> 01:39:40,030
How's your lady love?

1382
01:39:42,157 --> 01:39:44,576
We, uh, we broke up.

1383
01:39:44,702 --> 01:39:47,913
Oh, really? That's too bad.

1384
01:39:48,038 --> 01:39:52,209
Yeah. Now, George, he's got a love at
his side, and she's stickin' with him.

1385
01:39:52,334 --> 01:39:56,046
You know why?
Because he bought her chairs.

1386
01:39:56,171 --> 01:39:59,258
That's pretty smart to me.

1387
01:39:59,383 --> 01:40:02,011
You ever buy Lisa's chairs?

1388
01:40:02,136 --> 01:40:04,888
God, Doc's really drunk tonight. God.

1389
01:40:05,014 --> 01:40:11,145
Every woman has her chairs, something
she needs to put herself into, Banes.

1390
01:40:11,270 --> 01:40:14,523
You ever figure out what
Lisa's chairs were and buy 'em?

1391
01:40:16,775 --> 01:40:19,528
Nope.

1392
01:40:19,653 --> 01:40:21,238
But you're right about one thing.

1393
01:40:21,363 --> 01:40:25,534
George never changed.
Never. No, never.

1394
01:40:29,246 --> 01:40:31,373
Doc's makin' no sense tonight.

1395
01:40:31,498 --> 01:40:33,542
Yeah. Maybe he
caught it from George.

1396
01:40:36,337 --> 01:40:38,505
- Now, goddam it, Doc!
- Why do you have to tear him down?

1397
01:40:38,631 --> 01:40:41,175
What are you so afraid of?
What have you got to lose?

1398
01:40:41,300 --> 01:40:44,511
He wasn't selling anything.
He didn't want anything from anybody!

1399
01:40:44,637 --> 01:40:48,933
He wanted nothing from nobody.
Nothing! Nothing!

1400
01:40:52,853 --> 01:40:56,315
And you people have to tear him down
so you can sleep better tonight?

1401
01:40:56,440 --> 01:41:01,612
So you can prove that the world is flat
and sleep better tonight. Am l right?

1402
01:41:09,036 --> 01:41:10,412
l'm right.

1403
01:41:15,709 --> 01:41:18,087
To hell with all of you.
To hell with every one of you.

1404
01:41:28,764 --> 01:41:31,976
Hey, George. How ya doin'?
There ya go.

1405
01:41:32,101 --> 01:41:33,769
- Drink up.
- All right.

1406
01:41:37,731 --> 01:41:40,359
Good job.

1407
01:41:40,484 --> 01:41:44,029
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't take
the pudding. That's the good part.

1408
01:41:44,154 --> 01:41:45,281
Hey, is Cal around?

1409
01:41:45,406 --> 01:41:46,865
Sure. You wanna see him?

1410
01:41:46,991 --> 01:41:49,285
- Yeah, thanks.
- Okay.

1411
01:42:15,978 --> 01:42:17,021
- Hey, dude.
- Hey, man.

1412
01:42:17,146 --> 01:42:18,188
- How's it goin'?
- All right.

1413
01:42:18,314 --> 01:42:19,565
Can you stay for a few minutes?

1414
01:42:19,690 --> 01:42:21,483
Sure.

1415
01:42:21,609 --> 01:42:24,445
- Saved you some pudding again.
- Oh, what a buddy.

1416
01:42:24,570 --> 01:42:26,363
l love this stuff.

1417
01:42:32,286 --> 01:42:33,579
Night, dude.

1418
01:42:48,636 --> 01:42:50,512
Hey, Doc. You seen him?

1419
01:42:50,638 --> 01:42:52,139
- Seen who? What?
- George Malley. He's out.

1420
01:42:52,264 --> 01:42:54,683
He sneaked out.
We're lookin' all over for him.

1421
01:42:54,808 --> 01:42:56,852
- He's out?
- Yeah, he flew the coop.

1422
01:42:56,977 --> 01:42:59,188
Nobody knows where he is.
l heard it on the radio.

1423
01:42:59,313 --> 01:43:02,608
Flew the coop. Those FBl guys are
gonna have me drivin' around all night.

1424
01:43:02,733 --> 01:43:04,109
lf l gonna be home late again--

1425
01:43:13,243 --> 01:43:15,871
l want you to take these
and give them to Doc.

1426
01:43:15,996 --> 01:43:18,832
These l'm taking with me
because l haven't finished them yet.

1427
01:43:18,958 --> 01:43:20,751
They're for Doctor Ringold.

1428
01:43:22,461 --> 01:43:23,629
This l wrote for you, Nate.

1429
01:43:23,754 --> 01:43:25,798
lt's-- lt's about soils, and, uh,

1430
01:43:25,923 --> 01:43:27,549
some of my own thoughts.

1431
01:43:27,675 --> 01:43:29,468
- Your thoughts?
- Yeah.

1432
01:43:31,178 --> 01:43:34,223
- l could drive you, George.
- No. No, Nate, it's too chancy.

1433
01:43:36,433 --> 01:43:38,352
You can make it, man.

1434
01:43:38,477 --> 01:43:40,271
- Nate.
- George.

1435
01:44:06,630 --> 01:44:08,090
L.

1436
01:44:12,553 --> 01:44:14,388
Oh.

1437
01:44:15,723 --> 01:44:16,890
Oh.

1438
01:44:30,613 --> 01:44:32,031
l'll get it.

1439
01:44:32,156 --> 01:44:33,949
Now you put the top on it.

1440
01:44:35,659 --> 01:44:37,077
Attaboy.

1441
01:44:41,123 --> 01:44:43,167
- Leave me alone.
- Do it, Al.

1442
01:44:48,881 --> 01:44:50,174
That tight enough?

1443
01:44:50,299 --> 01:44:52,593
Why don't you do it once more?

1444
01:44:54,595 --> 01:44:56,096
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

1445
01:45:02,853 --> 01:45:04,021
There you go.

1446
01:45:04,146 --> 01:45:06,273
Good. Now you fixed it.

1447
01:45:11,946 --> 01:45:13,197
What?

1448
01:45:15,574 --> 01:45:18,702
You came here to die, didn't you?

1449
01:45:23,916 --> 01:45:28,295
But l'm-- l like this place,
and, um, l love the people here.

1450
01:45:56,240 --> 01:46:01,954
You know, if, if we were to,
uh, to put this apple down...

1451
01:46:02,079 --> 01:46:07,167
and leave it, it would be spoiled
and gone within a few days.

1452
01:46:07,293 --> 01:46:12,548
But if we were to take
a bite of it like this,

1453
01:46:12,673 --> 01:46:15,509
it would become part of us,

1454
01:46:15,634 --> 01:46:17,595
and we could take it with us forever.

1455
01:46:38,157 --> 01:46:41,952
Al-- Everything...

1456
01:46:42,077 --> 01:46:46,290
is on its way to somewhere.

1457
01:46:46,415 --> 01:46:48,375
Everything.

1458
01:47:08,145 --> 01:47:10,105
That's a good bite.

1459
01:47:32,628 --> 01:47:34,463
Keep an eye out.

1460
01:47:44,139 --> 01:47:47,142
Have you seen George Malley,
Miss Pennamin?

1461
01:47:47,268 --> 01:47:48,852
What's the point?

1462
01:47:51,105 --> 01:47:53,482
Look, it's not my call.

1463
01:47:55,317 --> 01:47:57,987
l haven't seen him.

1464
01:48:17,756 --> 01:48:20,467
- You mind if l get in your truck?
- Why?

1465
01:48:34,690 --> 01:48:36,358
What's your first name?

1466
01:48:39,820 --> 01:48:41,697
Jack.

1467
01:48:41,822 --> 01:48:44,325
How would you want to die, Jack?

1468
01:48:55,502 --> 01:48:58,255
Come on. Let's go.

1469
01:49:12,895 --> 01:49:14,730
There you are.

1470
01:49:17,900 --> 01:49:19,109
l knew l'd find you here.

1471
01:49:21,862 --> 01:49:24,198
What are you working on?

1472
01:49:24,323 --> 01:49:29,078
Doctor Ringold's coming tomorrow,
and l just wanted to finish this up.

1473
01:49:29,203 --> 01:49:33,248
- Finish what?
- Ah, just some possibilities.

1474
01:49:34,583 --> 01:49:36,251
Hey, come sit by me.

1475
01:49:38,712 --> 01:49:39,880
Hmm?

1476
01:49:41,507 --> 01:49:42,925
You scared?

1477
01:49:43,050 --> 01:49:46,387
No.

1478
01:49:46,512 --> 01:49:48,430
l wish l knew what you feel.

1479
01:49:48,555 --> 01:49:53,560
Oh, you do.
You've always known it, Lace.

1480
01:49:53,686 --> 01:49:58,148
l'll show you. When your children
were babies, how did you hold them?

1481
01:50:02,945 --> 01:50:05,864
And if they had
a hard time sleeping,

1482
01:50:05,990 --> 01:50:08,993
and you had to rock them to sleep,
well, how did you do it?

1483
01:50:31,473 --> 01:50:33,142
See?

1484
01:50:36,812 --> 01:50:39,857
Hey, look what l made back there.

1485
01:50:41,859 --> 01:50:44,820
That looks like a bed.

1486
01:50:44,945 --> 01:50:46,864
Are you expecting to get lucky?

1487
01:50:46,989 --> 01:50:50,284
No, just hoping.

1488
01:50:59,084 --> 01:51:03,005
When the road gets dark

1489
01:51:05,466 --> 01:51:09,470
You can no longer see

1490
01:51:11,680 --> 01:51:16,352
Just let my love
throw a spark, baby

1491
01:51:18,354 --> 01:51:22,733
And have a little faith in me

1492
01:51:24,818 --> 01:51:29,531
And when the tears you cry

1493
01:51:31,408 --> 01:51:35,663
Are all you can believe

1494
01:51:37,247 --> 01:51:42,086
Just give these lovin' arms a try, baby

1495
01:51:43,837 --> 01:51:48,217
And have a little faith in me

1496
01:51:48,342 --> 01:51:53,889
Have a little faith in me

1497
01:51:55,099 --> 01:51:59,728
Have a little faith in me

1498
