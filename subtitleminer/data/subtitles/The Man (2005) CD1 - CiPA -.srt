00:00:17,784 --> 00:00:19,945
Hello, Detroit.

2
00:00:19,986 --> 00:00:23,649
What a pleasure
to be here.

3
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:34,663
Ladies and gentlemen,
we in the exciting field

4
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,726
of dental supply sales

5
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,965
are here in the Motor City
for a reason...

6
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:41,530
to provide quality,
precision tools

7
00:00:41,574 --> 00:00:43,542
to professionals

8
00:00:43,576 --> 00:00:46,636
who demand the very best.

9
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:49,443
Thank you.

10
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:51,643
Whoa-ho-ho,
thank you very much.

11
00:00:51,684 --> 00:00:53,447
Please be seated.

12
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:55,044
Oh.

13
00:00:57,257 --> 00:00:59,487
I was just
going over my speech.

14
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:01,858
You've been going
over it for two weeks.

15
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:04,557
Honey, you know your speech.
I know your speech.

16
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:07,031
- The kids know it.
- It's a big one, Susan.

17
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:10,002
It's a speech for every sales rep
in the Northeast United States.

18
00:01:10,036 --> 00:01:11,833
It is a big one.

19
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:15,602
You've done very well
for yourself, Andy Fiddler.

20
00:01:16,776 --> 00:01:21,304
Now get dressed.
Your plane leaves at 7:00.

21
00:01:21,347 --> 00:01:23,247
You know, Detroit's
quite a sports town, honey.

22
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:26,411
Maybe I'll bring you
back a Piston.

23
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:30,389
Do me a favor.
Just bring yourself back.

24
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:32,687
Detroit ain't Wisconsin.

25
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:37,791
# One, two,
three, four #

26
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:40,561
# I... yeah, yeah #

27
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:45,600
# I... yeah, yeah #

28
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:48,129
# Rah rah rah rah #

29
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:51,541
# I... yeah, yeah #

30
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:58,148
# I just want to celebrate
another day of living #

31
00:01:58,184 --> 00:02:01,278
# I just want to celebrate #

32
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:03,949
# Another day of life #

33
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,220
# Put my faith
in the people #

34
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:08,819
# But the people
let me down #

35
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:13,322
# So I turn the other way
and I carry on anyhow #

36
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:15,732
# That's why I'm telling you I just
wanna celebrate #

37
00:02:15,768 --> 00:02:18,498
# Yeah, yeah,
another day of living #

38
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:22,497
# Yeah, I just want
to celebrate #

39
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:25,067
# Another day of life #

40
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:27,102
# Had my hand
on a dollar bill #

41
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,775
# And the dollar bill
blew away #

42
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:34,378
# But the sun is shining down
on me, and it's here to stay #

43
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,820
# That's why I'm telling you
I just want to celebrate #

44
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:39,552
# Yeah, yeah,
another day of living #

45
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:42,152
# Yeah, I just want
to celebrate... #

46
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:45,631
- Dude! Hold up!
- # Another day of living #

47
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:48,600
# I just want to celebrate #

48
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:55,632
# Another day of life #

49
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,610
# Don't let it all
get you down, no no... #

50
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:17,824
60 AR-15s,

51
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:22,767
30 M-4s, 6,000 rounds
of 5-5-6 ammunition

52
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:25,362
and three dozen
M-16s, all of it stolen from the vault

53
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:28,033
in this building.

54
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:31,669
But that's not why I rolled you
out of bed at 5:00 a.m., Agent Vann.

55
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:34,475
You wanna tell me how your partner
winds up a speed bump

56
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:37,176
on the 94 Freeway?
I'll tell you how.

57
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:40,311
Your partner was
the inside man on the job.

58
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:42,480
Once they had the guns,
he became a loose end.

59
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:44,683
I'm gonna tell you
something else,

60
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:47,557
something I've learned in 20 years
with Internal Affairs...

61
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:50,893
if a cop's dirty, nine times out of 10,
his partner's dirty too.

62
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,865
Wouldn't surprise me
if you were the one who popped him.

63
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:59,970
You got a bug up
your ass about me?

64
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:05,335
Well, let's get it out
right now, right here, you and me.

65
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,137
No, huh?

66
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:10,843
So step off,
stop wasting my time.

67
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:12,714
You don't seem too upset
about your partner.

68
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:16,210
You want to charge me with not being
upset, go right ahead. Be my guest.

69
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,020
Hell, I'll write a full confession
about how I don't give a shit.

70
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:22,585
If he was dirty,
he got what he deserved.

71
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,064
I'm not finished
with you.

72
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:29,125
Well, I'm finished with you,
and let me tell you

73
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:31,659
what I learned
in all my years on the job...

74
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:34,229
Don't trust anyone.

75
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,174
That includes partners

76
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:39,406
and especially
Internal Affairs skid marks.

77
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,310
I'll be seeing you, Vann.

78
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:48,416
I tried to keep
I.A. Off your back.

79
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:54,526
Booty. Mmm,
don't get into this.

80
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,027
I'm already into this.

81
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:58,895
You know those weapons
will be out of the city within 24 hours.

82
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:01,195
Yeah, well, you can't
set up a buy in 24 hours.

83
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:04,397
- Watch me.
- Vann, nothing stupid.

84
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:06,462
Yes, Lieutenant.

85
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:16,706
Bye-bye, enjoy your stay.
Bye, hope you had a nice flight.

86
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:19,650
I had a wonderful flight, and I'm
wondering if you can do me a favor.

87
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:22,246
I was talking to one
of the stewardesses back there,

88
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:25,655
and we were discussing tongue scrapers.
I found one in my bag.

89
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:27,660
I'm wondering
if you can pass this along.

90
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:29,753
- I'm a dental supply salesman.
- Yes, I will.

91
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:31,388
Sir, you might
have to step aside.

92
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:33,160
Just tell her it's
daily tongue-scraping

93
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,962
and anti-bacterial
conditioning

94
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,094
which will assure her
the freshest breath.

95
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,018
See this right here?

96
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:56,954
This is a nickel-plated Ladysmith
nine Mary-Mary chrome inlay. Go on,

97
00:05:56,989 --> 00:06:00,516
- feel that.
- It's got a nice weight to it.

98
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,528
- Yeah, so do you, baby.
- What?

99
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:08,232
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, hold up... that's a cop car!

100
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:21,970
Get your ass off my car, Booty!

101
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:24,505
Come on!

102
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,644
Your ass is still
on my car, Booty!

103
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:33,819
Run faster, Booty!
Pump those arms! Get those knees up!

104
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,556
- Your form is all jacked up, dawg!
- What you want, man?

105
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:38,757
- I want to buy some guns!
- I don't know

106
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:41,460
- what you're talking about!
- I'm talking about a telephone pole.

107
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:43,093
What?

108
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:02,218
Why do we have
to do this every time?

109
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:05,019
It's these repetitive ass-whippings
that cause guys like me

110
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:07,491
- to burn out on the job.
- Du... ah-ha... ah!

111
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:10,189
Somebody wiped out
our vault last night. Who was it?

112
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:13,164
- How the hell should I know?
- I'm gonna check the front of my car.

113
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,760
If it smells like ass, I'm gonna
beat you like a runaway slave.

114
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:18,361
No no, all right,
all right, all right.

115
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:20,269
- All right what?
- Maybe I heard something.

116
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:22,365
Tell me what you heard.

117
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:24,706
Something about a lot
of merchandise in play. That's all.

118
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:27,713
Ooh. You know
how I can tell you're lying?

119
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:30,545
I can smell the bullshit
coming out of your mouth.

120
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:33,746
No, all right!
Maybe I know one of the guys, huh?

121
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:36,277
Well, hook me up.
Tell him you found a buyer.

122
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:38,085
Oh, man, he already got
a buyer. You're too late.

123
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:41,218
Tell him I'll double his price.
I can get 20 grand cash right now.

124
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,922
20 grand? Man, that'll only
get you a taste, dawg.

125
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:47,558
A taste is all I need.

126
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,263
Hook me up. Now.

127
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:06,118
- $38.50.
- That was very nice drive in, Mr., uh...

128
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,313
- is it Bedwetter?
- Bedwe-teer.

129
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:11,016
I see you're from
Turkey, Mr. Budweeder.

130
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:14,049
I've got $20, $40.
There you go. Keep the change.

131
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:18,154
I was in Turkey
recently, uh...

132
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:25,234
Santos,
what's cracking, dawg?

133
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:27,762
- Yo, I need 20 grand.
- Yeah, don't we all?

134
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:31,106
I need that in non-sequential
unmarked bills, and I'm in a hurry.

135
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:33,338
I'm not your
personal ATM, man.

136
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:35,370
Come on, Santos.

137
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:37,905
You know you're gonna give it up,
so cut the bullshit.

138
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,510
Hey, I don't have that kind
of cash down here right now.

139
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:44,455
Nuh-uh. See? You're lying. Now
I personally logged a million in cash

140
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:47,323
into that vault
right over there just last month

141
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,487
on a case we both
know hasn't gone to trial yet,

142
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,827
so you're still holding.

143
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:54,332
What happened
between us, Santos?

144
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,858
Where the love, dawg?

145
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:59,701
You realize it's my ass
if you come up short again.

146
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:02,139
It's just flash money.
I'll have it back this afternoon.

147
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:04,142
Come on, now go
and get that.

148
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:06,701
I'll have the paperwork
done by the time you get back.

149
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:10,944
All right, but I need
that money back here by 4:00.

150
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:12,473
You can trust me, man.

151
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:15,043
Come on now.
I'm in a hurry. Chop-chop.

152
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:17,180
Work that combination, baby.

153
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:25,190
Look, man, they'll give you a taste,
then they'll tell you

154
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,597
where to bring the money.
They don't want the goods and the cash

155
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:30,329
- in the same spot.
- Booty, I do this for a living.

156
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:32,963
Look, I don't know these guys.
They're from out of town.

157
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:35,997
What do you know, Booty?

158
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:42,375
This is the place, man.
He'll give you a gun and a phone now

159
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,576
and call you later
for the money.

160
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:46,608
Take the corner seat
at the counter

161
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:50,383
and be carrying a "USA Today."
A "USA Today," the newspaper.

162
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,983
Look, man, I did what
you asked me to do. I'm done with this.

163
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:55,255
You better hurry up, man.

164
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:57,228
By this time tomorrow,
the guns will be gone.

165
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:41,302
- You want a taste?
- Pardon me?

166
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,571
- There's your taste.
- That's my taste?

167
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:50,905
Wait for our call.

168
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,750
Hey!

169
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:10,124
What?

170
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,103
He's got a gun.

171
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:15,471
No no, this is not...
No no no, it's not my gun.

172
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,635
It's the man that
was sitting here he j... he just left.

173
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,838
Oh oh!
He's got a gun, man!

174
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,574
It's going back in the bag.
Back in the bag.

175
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:23,639
- Drop the gun!
- Ah!

176
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,810
- Drop the gun! Now!
- Yes.

177
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,876
- Yes, the gun's going down.
- Drop it!

178
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,412
The gun is going down.
Gun is down.

179
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:33,220
- Gun is down.
- Just shut up.

180
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:34,783
All right. Ah!

181
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:37,193
You picked the wrong day to pull
a stick-up, dickwad.

182
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:39,129
It's not my gun.
Some guy gave it to me.

183
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:41,156
- What guy?
- Some guy. He gave me a bag,

184
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,896
- and he said, "Taste it. Taste it."
- He said what?

185
00:11:43,936 --> 00:11:46,131
- Something about a taste.
- Tell me what he said,

186
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:48,538
exactly word for word
what he said.

187
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:51,270
He said, "That's your taste,"
but there was nothing to taste,

188
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,835
just a phone and a gun.
Look, I just went in for a cof...

189
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,871
- Oh shit. They think you're me.
- They think I'm black?

190
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,441
No, they don't think
you're... A.T.F.

191
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:01,316
You're coming with me.

192
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:03,480
What? I have done
nothing wrong!

193
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,923
- Well, Simon?
- It's coming.

194
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:18,834
All right, I got him.

195
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:21,635
"Fiddler, Andy.
Milwaukee, Wisconsin."

196
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:24,165
He's not federal, he's not
local, no law enforcement.

197
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:27,407
- No sheet. He's clean.
- Yeah, he's too clean.

198
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:30,142
- Screw him.
- No, wait a minute.

199
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:33,674
"Istanbul, Turkey.
Customs.

200
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:37,587
- Trafficking."
- Turkey? He do any time?

201
00:12:37,623 --> 00:12:40,922
- Interpol shows an outstanding warrant.
- He got away from the Turks?

202
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:45,158
No shit. This guy's gotta be
smarter than he looks, huh?

203
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:48,598
Well, he can't be
any dumber than he looks.

204
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:51,000
So what's this guy
look like?

205
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:55,666
Well, he, uh...
he had very good teeth.

206
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:58,541
- What does he look like?
- He looks good. He looks good.

207
00:12:58,577 --> 00:13:01,273
He had a very nice face,
very handsome face.

208
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:03,747
He was a very
attractive man.

209
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,614
N... not to me.

210
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:09,052
Uh, I mean, I am married
to a woman.

211
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:11,113
And even if I wasn't married,

212
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:13,250
I don't mean that kind of attractive.
Personally,

213
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:16,193
- he was not attractive to me.
- Describe him to me.

214
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:18,128
Short hair.
Short hair

215
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:20,826
which made his head
look smaller than it actually is,

216
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:24,461
and I only mention that because I've
been told my head is somewhat large,

217
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:27,097
and when I looked over at his,
it's like... you know when you look

218
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:31,041
through binoculars the wrong
way, it-it-it looks...

219
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:34,876
That's you.
Answer it!

220
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:36,313
Hello.

221
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:37,975
- Turk.
- Just a moment, please.

222
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:40,747
- Can you believe this?
- He wants to talk to the Turk.

223
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:42,276
- That's you.
- That's me?

224
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,414
- That's you.
- I'm the Turk?

225
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:46,583
Look at you.

226
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:51,062
This is the Turk.

227
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:53,929
Okay, listen, Turk.
When this phone rings, you answer it.

228
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:56,264
- You understand?
- Yes, I answer it.

229
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:58,532
- You and you alone. Are we clear?
- Me and me alone, right.

230
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:01,540
Great. Now listen, you put
the package in the trash can

231
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:06,443
on the northwest corner of Fort
and Woodward in five minutes.

232
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:08,844
- Hello.
- So what did he say?

233
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:11,315
Something about a package
and a trash can.

234
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,615
Look, I have nothing to do
with this. I'm here for a convention.

235
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:16,621
I don't give a shit.

236
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:19,123
Now what trash can?

237
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:22,286
Fort and Woodward.

238
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:24,091
Whoa!

239
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:43,106
Take this package,
put it in that trash can,

240
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:44,638
and you can go.

241
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:51,881
I should point out
to you, sir,

242
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:54,290
that I am taking
a mental picture of you

243
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:56,385
just in case there's...

244
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:58,794
any... trouble.

245
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:46,670
Hey, you know what?
Th-this... this is not for you.

246
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:48,407
Who's it for?

247
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,574
Well, it's... it's,
uh, for somebody else.

248
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,413
- Who?
- Just someone.

249
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,851
- Someone you don't know.
- Try me.

250
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:58,220
No, I'm not trying you.
This is not garbage, okay?

251
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:00,225
This is business,

252
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:03,524
so just please
don't touch it.

253
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:05,689
All right,
give me the bag.

254
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:09,690
- Give me the bag.
- Oh, Jesus.

255
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:11,760
It's not your bag.
See what he's doing?

256
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,398
- He took my bag.
- Who is this guy?

257
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,466
- This bag is mine! It's not his.
- Damn!

258
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:21,036
Okay okay.
What is the matter with you?

259
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,140
- Just let me go. All right.
- Get up. Get up!

260
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:26,151
- Get in the car. Get in the car!
- I think we should...

261
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:28,983
We should look
for another can.

262
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:36,720
What the hell is
the matter with you?

263
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:39,526
I ask you to do one thing,
and you screw it up.

264
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,268
- Hello.
- What the hell's the matter with you?

265
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:46,635
I ask you to do one thing,
and you screw it up.

266
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,003
Yes, well, this was
not planned well.

267
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,031
No no, listen, Turk.
You know what?

268
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:52,373
You just bring the package
to First and Bagley

269
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:54,538
and wait there.

270
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:59,074
So what did he say now?

271
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,018
Hey, get back here!

272
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,481
Excuse me.

273
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,115
Now you pay.

274
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:08,183
Get off my car!

275
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:14,463
Get down! Oh man,
he's got a gun! Ah!

276
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,695
Ouch!
Ouch! Ouch!

277
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:20,796
Ow! Oh! Ow!
Oh, boy! Oh!

278
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:24,002
Ah! Ah!
Ow ow ow ow!

279
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:30,776
9-1-1.
What's your emergency?

280
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:32,807
- Yes, hello, I've been shot.
- Can you give me a location?

281
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:35,615
- I don't know. Downtown.
- Where downtown, sir?

282
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:37,349
A man in a black car
kidnapped me.

283
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,050
Do you have
a license plate number?

284
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:41,150
Yes, just give me
a second.

285
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:46,562
"347DNB." Hurry.

286
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:48,065
I just called 9-1-1,

287
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,068
- and you are in serious trouble.
- Get up.

288
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:52,070
- You shot me.
- I grazed you.

289
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:53,935
Well, that's still
shooting me!

290
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:56,998
- Watch your ass.
- Ow ow ow ow!

291
00:17:58,177 --> 00:18:00,372
You could have
killed me back there.

292
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,471
If I wanted to kill you,
you'd be dead.

293
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:05,506
I wanted to graze you, you're grazed.
It was a training bullet.

294
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:09,851
Well, I'm bleeding, although you might
call it "training blood."

295
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:13,287
Here, use this.

296
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:15,850
Taco sauce?

297
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:17,862
Yes, it's a natural
antiseptic.

298
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:20,160
Sprinkle some of that on your ass
so you don't get an infection.

299
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:23,396
Yeah, well, I don't even
wanna know how you discovered that.

300
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:26,598
So what, you keep
this in your glove compartment and just

301
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:30,074
splash it on a salami sandwich
and then splash some on your behind?

302
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,100
Use it or don't use it.
It's your ass.

303
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:34,738
You got any guacamole in there?
I hear it makes a great cold compress.

304
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,078
- Just put it back!
- All right, I'll use it. I'll use it.

305
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:44,456
Don't you have
traffic to look at?

306
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,924
Oh, shit.
You gotta be kidding me.

307
00:18:57,569 --> 00:18:59,469
Get out of the vehicle
with your hands in the air!

308
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:02,770
Get out of the car
and show me your hands!

309
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,606
Turn around!
Hands on your head!

310
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,737
- No no no no no, I'm not with him.
- Your hands!

311
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:09,713
I don't know him!
He just...

312
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:11,545
he... he...
he kidnapped me.

313
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,813
He took me
against my will.

314
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:15,820
He... look. You see?

315
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:18,550
He wanted to put
taco sauce on my butt.

316
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,956
The guy is nuts.

317
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,756
Nuts.

318
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:24,659
- Hands!
- Run my plates!

319
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:26,664
You! Back in the car.

320
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:29,132
- Your hands!
- You wanna see my hands?

321
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,568
Here.

322
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:35,164
Federal agent.
Run my plates!

323
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:45,841
- The car is federal, sir. A.T.F.
- That's right.

324
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:47,909
Federal agent.

325
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:52,151
Federal prisoner.
Back in the car!

326
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,786
You are interfering
with a federal investigation.

327
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:58,625
Move your asses!

328
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:15,303
That was fun.

329
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:29,322
Give this to him
and walk away.

330
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:35,458
Hey. If you try
to run this time,

331
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,492
I'm gonna put a bullet
in part of the ass you really need.

332
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:01,387
Ooh-ooh! Oh!

333
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,872
So you like the merch?

334
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:19,169
- The merch?
- The merch.

335
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:21,475
Well, you know,
there are days

336
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:24,710
that I like it
and days that I don't.

337
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,548
It depends.
I'm on the fence.

338
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:31,852
- Do you like the merchandise, Turk?
- Yes, I do...

339
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,721
like the merchandise.

340
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:36,387
I, uh...
thanks for asking.

341
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:38,896
So there's gonna be
20 grand in there, right?

342
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:41,524
In the bag.
Come on.

343
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:56,813
Good.

344
00:21:56,848 --> 00:21:59,282
Good first step.
We'll be in touch.

345
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,809
And, uh,
one more thing, Turk...

346
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:03,878
No more fruitcake
stuff, okay?

347
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:07,585
- Sure.
- Good. Goodbye.

348
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:18,768
Get in the car.

349
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:21,238
- Why?
- I'm not done with you yet.

350
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:23,764
- You said I was done.
- I lied. I do that.

351
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:25,800
- Now get up. Get in the car.
- No.

352
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,506
Get up!

353
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:30,845
Hey... don't make me
chase you.

354
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:32,281
I'm tell...

355
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:34,182
- Hey!
- Stop!

356
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:35,652
Stop! Help me!

357
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:37,348
- Hey!
- Help!

358
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:39,414
You're under arrest.
Hands on the car.

359
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:41,653
On the car!

360
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:45,630
Who the hell
is this guy?

361
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:47,063
Run that.

362
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,503
He's international.

363
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,600
- Ow!
- Watch your head.

364
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:11,883
Okay, that's it.
I am writing a letter.

365
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:16,016
- Number 3.
- Number 3.

366
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:20,828
Three, step forward.
Three, that's you.

367
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:26,396
- That's him.
- You sure?

368
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:28,565
I'll never forget
that face.

369
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:30,973
- All right, thank you. You can go.
- Excuse me.

370
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:33,671
I'd like to speak
to whoever's in charge, please.

371
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:36,374
All right, number 3, stay.
The rest can go.

372
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,212
Thank you.

373
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,014
Boy, sometimes you
just have to speak up.

374
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:45,588
- Are you in charge here?
- Yes, I am.

375
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:48,491
Oh, boy, have I been waiting
to talk to you.

376
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:50,290
- Really?
- My name is Andy Fiddler.

377
00:23:50,328 --> 00:23:53,456
I'm in dental supply sales,
and believe you me,

378
00:23:53,498 --> 00:23:55,762
I never thought I'd be standing here
in a police station

379
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:58,599
- with a bullet wound in the keister.
- Hmm.

380
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:01,037
But I am extremely upset
with this man here,

381
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:03,597
and I must confess
with your whole operation in general,

382
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:07,339
because quite frankly,
I have nothing to do with any of this.

383
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:09,370
Well, that's not what
it looks like, Mr. Keister.

384
00:24:09,414 --> 00:24:11,439
The weapon you used
in the diner,

385
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:14,111
stolen from A.T.F.'s vault.

386
00:24:14,152 --> 00:24:16,120
The gun you're robbing
the cashier with.

387
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:18,179
Oh, no no no no.
No no, there's no robbing.

388
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:20,748
I'm not robbing.
You see, although I can certainly see

389
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:23,192
how you'd get
that impression.

390
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:27,722
We also got a red notice
from Interpol when we ran your name.

391
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:30,291
There's an outstanding
warrant for your arrest.

392
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:33,930
- What?
- Istanbul, Turkey ring any bells?

393
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:38,068
Oh. Oh, yes.

394
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:40,509
It does ring some bells,

395
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:44,072
and believe it or not, there is
a perfectly reasonable explanation

396
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:47,414
for that, and you will
find it very funny,

397
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:49,784
- 'cause it's quite a story.
- Tell it on the way.

398
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:53,587
- Place your left hand here.
- So I took the family to Europe

399
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:57,561
in the summer of '98, and one
of our stops was Istanbul, in Turkey...

400
00:24:57,596 --> 00:24:59,723
a must-see
if you've never been.

401
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:03,632
- Anyhoo, my wife has this thing about...
- Yo, Vann, phone call.

402
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:08,606
...Persian rugs.
Okay, I'm not a complainer,

403
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,074
but that officer
was very abusive.

404
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:13,737
I mean, not only was
he physically violent,

405
00:25:13,778 --> 00:25:17,009
but... but more disturbing to me,
he... he was just rude.

406
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:19,676
- Vann.
- Your daughter wants to know

407
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:21,845
if you're coming
to her recital tonight.

408
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:24,754
Oh you know,
I can't.

409
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:27,155
Uh, I'm in the middle
of something right now.

410
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:31,959
Um, I gotta go.
Would you tell her for me?

411
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:35,296
You need to tell her.

412
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,798
So when we got back
to the hotel,

413
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:45,332
we discovered
the rug is too big for the suitcase.

414
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,345
So we decided
to leave the rug at the hotel

415
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,506
to be sent to us
when we got back home.

416
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:51,140
Turn right.

417
00:25:51,182 --> 00:25:54,174
So we finally get home,
but we never got the rug.

418
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,847
Long story short,
we get a letter from the hotel

419
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:59,015
that said the rug had
been seized at Customs.

420
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:01,423
Now evidently
this rug had been stolen.

421
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:04,223
It was a 1,000-year-old
prayer rug,

422
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:07,197
and... and it was stolen,
but how was I to know?

423
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,861
I didn't know, and I'm the one
that's out $230.

424
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:13,462
Yeah, it was all very innocent,
as I'm sure

425
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:16,338
- you can now understand.
- I see.

426
00:26:16,374 --> 00:26:18,308
- Lock him up.
- What?

427
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:21,005
- Let's go.
- What?

428
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:22,570
- Let's go.
- Get him out of here!

429
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:24,275
What? Wait a minute.
Wait a minute!

430
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:25,943
- This way.
- I have done nothing wrong!

431
00:26:25,984 --> 00:26:29,147
- Come on. Move it.
- I have... I... I...

432
00:26:29,187 --> 00:26:31,849
I haven't...
I haven't done anything!

433
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:35,758
Yo, this is the number
to this phone.

434
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:37,785
I want you to put
a trace on it.

435
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:41,697
I want the owner and an address.
Call me when you got it.

436
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:43,724
Okay.

437
00:26:47,405 --> 00:26:50,465
Lieu, you looking
for me?

438
00:26:50,508 --> 00:26:52,942
Explain the Wisconsin kid.

439
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:56,436
I set up a buy with the bad guys,
he got in the middle of it,

440
00:26:56,481 --> 00:26:58,346
- now they think he's me.
- So you're telling me

441
00:26:58,383 --> 00:26:59,907
- the guns are still in play.
- Yeah.

442
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:02,010
- How do you know this isn't a setup?
- With this guy?

443
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:05,216
- Yeah, with this guy.
- Not with this guy.

444
00:27:05,256 --> 00:27:06,621
Okay, where is he?

445
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:09,422
He's in holding,
and he's gonna stay there.

446
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:12,453
Yes, Ma'am.

447
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:21,865
Shit.
They ate him already.

448
00:27:25,877 --> 00:27:28,471
Caucasian gentlemen.
Big glasses.

449
00:27:28,513 --> 00:27:32,574
Oh yeah, didn't have
the heart to put him in there.

450
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,922
Ah-ah!

451
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:42,916
Thank you.

452
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:45,521
- Come on.
- So, am I free to go now?

453
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:48,396
Go? Oh, hell no.
They're fixing a shit sandwich upstairs,

454
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:50,401
and you're
the mayonnaise.

455
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:52,426
Possession of a stolen weapon,

456
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:54,631
armed robbery and the Turkish
government wants

457
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,868
to have a little chat
with you before we're done.

458
00:27:56,908 --> 00:27:59,672
Okay, I want to talk
to an attorney.

459
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:01,975
I get one phone call,
and I want to call an attorney.

460
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:04,345
Let me lay your options
out for you here...

461
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:07,510
You can come with me
as a Suspect Who's Cooperating,

462
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:11,886
or you can stay here
and get married tonight.

463
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:18,718
- So what's it gonna be?
- Okay, just so we're clear...

464
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:22,598
I am not choosing
to go with you.

465
00:28:24,235 --> 00:28:26,499
I'm choosing
not to stay with them.

466
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,870
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

467
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:39,914
Lag escort, first-time
session.

468
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:41,418
Hang on.

469
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:49,885
This is one
screwed up crew.

470
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:53,728
All right, just so
there's no confusion, here's the deal...

471
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:55,733
You're in my world now,
not yours.

472
00:28:55,767 --> 00:29:00,295
And in my world, your responsibilities
begin and end with me.

473
00:29:00,338 --> 00:29:03,171
And what would those
responsibilities be?

474
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:05,199
Well, these guys think you wanna
buy guns from them.

475
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:07,211
I need you to meet 'em one more time
and set up a buy,

476
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:10,646
- so I can bust their ass.
- Okay, I am developing a slight phobia

477
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:13,412
about meeting these guys.
The whole meeting thing, quite frankly,

478
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:15,578
is getting irritating.
I have to be honest.

479
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,986
Look, I have done everything
you've asked me to do.

480
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:19,990
Why can't I go?

481
00:29:20,024 --> 00:29:21,992
What does any
of this have to do with me?

482
00:29:22,026 --> 00:29:24,927
Because every time
these guys meet somebody new,

483
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:27,659
they're on the lookout
for the Man.

484
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:30,998
And you most certainly
do not look like the Man.

485
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:34,596
Oh, I don't look
like the Man.

486
00:29:34,639 --> 00:29:37,938
Well, thank you, because
that clears up absolutely nothing.

487
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:40,069
Who... who is the Man?

488
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:42,841
The heat, the pig,
the po-po, 5-0,

489
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:45,714
the undercover agent
that's gonna bust their ass.

490
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:48,776
You're such a white bread son
of a bitch, these assholes trust you.

491
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:51,414
Well, you know,
people do trust me.

492
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:54,755
- That's not a compliment, shit stain.
- Okay, you know what?

493
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:58,024
Why do you swear so much?
Do you think it makes you sound tougher

494
00:29:58,062 --> 00:30:00,030
when you just swear
all the time?

495
00:30:00,064 --> 00:30:02,897
- Fuck you.
- Okay, that's good. That's really good.

496
00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:06,392
Really classy. You know,
I could go around all day saying,

497
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:08,769
"F-U. F this
and F that

498
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:11,071
and F-ing this,
you mother-F-er."

499
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:15,443
But I don't because there has
to be some civility in the world.

500
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:20,978
Incidentally, there is a trick
you can use to curb that habit.

501
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:24,455
Every time you feel like saying
the "F" word, just go ahead and say it,

502
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:27,754
and then add,
"Crying out loud."

503
00:30:27,792 --> 00:30:30,420
Fuck crying out loud.

504
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:33,396
Fuck crying out loud.
Fuck crying out loud.

505
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:35,991
And before you know it, you're saying,
"Oh, for crying out loud."

506
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:41,129
Let's see here.

507
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:44,403
- Oh, boy. Well...
- You did make her a promise.

508
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:46,171
You always break
your promises to her.

509
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:48,441
You want your daughter growing up
like you, not trusting anybody?

510
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:50,970
- That's not the point.
- It's exactly the point.

511
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:52,846
No, it's not.

512
00:30:52,884 --> 00:30:55,250
You promised her you'd be
at her recital tonight.

513
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:57,220
Something came up.

514
00:30:57,255 --> 00:31:00,554
You know, my little girl's a ballerina too,
and she's exactly your age.

515
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:02,184
- Really?
- Yeah,

516
00:31:02,227 --> 00:31:04,320
I help her
with her pirouettes all the time.

517
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:05,829
That's not
what this is about.

518
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,832
This is about
you not wanting to go

519
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,096
- because her stepdad's gonna be there.
- Oh.

520
00:31:10,134 --> 00:31:12,534
Is he dancing tonight, too?

521
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:14,435
And with the right
feet positioning...

522
00:31:14,472 --> 00:31:18,306
there you go,
okay. Well!

523
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:20,971
Yeah, that's good.

524
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:23,310
Daddy, can Andy come
with you tonight?

525
00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:25,509
Um...

526
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,211
Look, honey...

527
00:31:28,286 --> 00:31:31,346
Daddy can't come tonight.
I'm sorry.

528
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:35,155
But I promise I will be there
next time. I swear.

529
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:37,661
I'm gonna make it up to you.

530
00:31:37,695 --> 00:31:40,721
Oh, fuck...
crying out loud.

531
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:43,461
Hold on.

532
00:31:43,501 --> 00:31:46,527
Look, Daddy's
gotta go, okay?

533
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,567
Go ahead.
Goodbye.

534
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:03,383
It was very nice
meeting you, Kate.

535
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:06,390
- You too.
- So what you got?

536
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:08,824
- The owner of that phone?
- Yeah.

537
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:11,488
- It's Cortez. Manny Cortez.
- Who?

538
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:13,895
- Katie.
- Thanks.

539
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:18,693
Come inside,
sweetheart.

540
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:20,762
Hang on.

541
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:25,707
Cortez's is back elevator,
second floor.

542
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:30,540
Oh, shit.

543
00:32:30,581 --> 00:32:33,209
- Don't get up.
- You scared me, man.

544
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:35,116
What are you still
doing here, Cortez?

545
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:38,281
You were supposed to meet us
at the warehouse over three hours ago.

546
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:42,087
Do you mind?
I'm, uh...

547
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:44,356
I'm in the middle
of something here.

548
00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:46,420
I truly don't care.

549
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:50,230
Hey, look. There's too much heat
on those guns, all right?

550
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:53,101
I mean, you killed a cop.
That was not in the deal.

551
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:55,401
Yeah, well,
he became a problem.

552
00:32:56,574 --> 00:32:58,542
Listen, we got
the merchandise.

553
00:32:58,576 --> 00:33:00,544
You need
to pay us for it.

554
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:02,705
I'm out, all right?

555
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:06,683
- I cannot do shit with those guns.
- You know what, Cortez?

556
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:09,152
That's your problem.
You got the money or not?

557
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:11,655
Find another buyer,
all right?

558
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:13,884
And you know what?
I suggest you get out of town

559
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:15,552
as quickly as possible.

560
00:33:15,593 --> 00:33:19,791
Hey. Yo.
Close the door on your way out.

561
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,424
Sure.

562
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:29,765
Well, I guess that just leaves
the Turk.

563
00:33:29,807 --> 00:33:31,297
I guess so.

564
00:33:35,747 --> 00:33:37,738
Well, you've got
a very nice family.

565
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:40,012
You've just got
a wonderful daughter

566
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:42,246
- and a lovely wife.
- Ex-wife.

567
00:33:42,286 --> 00:33:44,686
Ex-wife, yes, well, she seems
like a very nice person.

568
00:33:44,722 --> 00:33:46,417
- Yeah.
- Yeah, so... so...

569
00:33:46,457 --> 00:33:47,981
so it just didn't work out, huh?

570
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,688
Well, whatever.

571
00:33:51,729 --> 00:33:53,697
- Would you like to see my family?
- No!

572
00:33:53,731 --> 00:33:55,722
Well, I would like
to see my family.

573
00:33:58,069 --> 00:34:00,799
This is my oldest...
Hannah, she's 12.

574
00:34:00,838 --> 00:34:03,466
I'm trying to get her interested
in the dental equipment game,

575
00:34:03,508 --> 00:34:08,002
but I guess at that age, you know,
it's just not cool yet.

576
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:11,140
This is my little
ballerina right here.

577
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:17,315
And this is my wife Susan,
holding our newest addition... Emily.

578
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:20,017
Just turned 2.
Already talking a mile a minute.

579
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:22,856
Just talk talk talk
talk talk talk talk talk talk talk

580
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,226
talk talk talk.
A regular little chatterbox.

581
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:28,198
- I wonder who she got that from.
- I think she got it from me.

582
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,757
- You think?
- Oh...

583
00:34:32,937 --> 00:34:37,397
Well, I am, uh... I'm sorry
about your... situation.

584
00:34:37,442 --> 00:34:39,376
What situation
would that be?

585
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,605
Well, you've got
people who love you,

586
00:34:41,646 --> 00:34:44,547
and yet you seem
like a very sad and lonely man.

587
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,550
- I'm not lonely.
- Well, I think you're lonely.

588
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:48,916
- I'm not lonely.
- Fine, you're not lonely. You're alone.

589
00:34:48,953 --> 00:34:51,581
Yes, I'm alone,
but I'm not lonely.

590
00:34:51,622 --> 00:34:53,590
It's two different things.

591
00:34:53,624 --> 00:34:57,651
Does the expression
"No man is an island" ring any bells?

592
00:34:57,695 --> 00:35:00,596
Does the expression
"Shut your ass up" ring any bells?

593
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:19,041
What now?

594
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:20,607
I have to go visit
a friend of mine.

595
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:22,949
- Can I go with you?
- No.

596
00:35:22,987 --> 00:35:25,182
Oh, well, I would
really like to go with you.

597
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:28,681
Look, everybody
in this neighborhood knows my ride.

598
00:35:28,726 --> 00:35:31,320
- Nobody messes with it.
- Okay.

599
00:35:53,117 --> 00:35:55,017
- # Big booty bitches, well... #
- Oh!

600
00:35:55,052 --> 00:35:57,452
# Like to dutch,
another one bites the dust... #

601
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:09,864
Cortez.

602
00:36:13,704 --> 00:36:16,264
Manny, where you at?

603
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:18,673
You hiding
under the bed again?

604
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:24,107
Woo! Manny.

605
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:38,822
- A.T.F.
- Yeah, this is Vann.

606
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:42,264
Would you send a bag wagon over
to Manny Cortez's place?

607
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,530
- The gun dealer?
- Yeah, he took the deluxe cruise

608
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:46,560
up shit's creek...

609
00:36:46,604 --> 00:36:49,596
compliments
of a.45 to the chest.

610
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:07,382
No.

611
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:14,524
Hey! Hey!

612
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:29,069
Good afternoon.
Out of the car.

613
00:37:31,682 --> 00:37:34,173
- Oh! Oh! Oh-ah!
- Whoa! What are you doing?

614
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:38,252
Ooh.

615
00:37:49,967 --> 00:37:52,868
- Oh!
- Hey!

616
00:37:52,903 --> 00:37:55,337
This was not a good idea.

617
00:37:55,373 --> 00:37:58,035
Oh boy! Oh!

618
00:38:01,078 --> 00:38:03,069
Oh!

619
00:38:18,162 --> 00:38:19,754
Oh!

620
00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:29,835
Drives pretty good.

621
00:38:33,244 --> 00:38:35,906
You idiot! Moron!

622
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:45,717
Well, you left the keys
in the ignition.

623
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:50,358
Not the smartest thing
to do for a policeman.

624
00:38:51,862 --> 00:38:54,990
This would be a good time
for you to be quiet.

625
00:38:55,032 --> 00:38:57,296
I know that's nearly
impossible for you,

626
00:38:57,335 --> 00:39:00,327
but if I hear the sound
of your voice right now,

627
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:03,602
I can't be responsible
for my actions.

628
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:08,442
So this would be
a very good time for you to shut up!

629
00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:25,118
I have a small question.

630
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:51,046
I still have a question,
and I think I'm entitled...

631
00:39:51,088 --> 00:39:52,851
What?

632
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,619
Do you have a plan?

633
00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:56,285
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

634
00:39:56,327 --> 00:39:59,194
If you fail to plan,
you plan to fail.

635
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:02,666
Just a little constructive
criticism, okay?

636
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,930
That's how two people
working together help ea...

637
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:07,699
Whoa whoa whoa whoa!
We're not working together,

638
00:40:08,699 --> 00:40:18,699
