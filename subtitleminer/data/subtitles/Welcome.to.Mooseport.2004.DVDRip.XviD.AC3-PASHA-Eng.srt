1
00:00:22,087 --> 00:00:24,999
<i>- How do you like this rain, Danny?</i>
<i>- I'm sick of it, Jim. </i>

2
00:00:25,247 --> 00:00:28,398
<i>Mr. Sunshine should be peeking</i>
<i>through those early morning clouds. </i>

3
00:00:28,567 --> 00:00:29,886
<i>Yeah. Promises, promises. </i>

4
00:00:30,047 --> 00:00:34,120
<i>Folks, we have a question for you. </i>
<i>First caller with the right answer wins:</i>

5
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:37,359
<i>An orthopedic tractor seat cushion</i>
<i>from Handy's Hardware. </i>

6
00:00:37,527 --> 00:00:39,677
<i>Okay, he was a recent</i>
<i>two-term president. </i>

7
00:00:39,887 --> 00:00:42,117
<i>- Of the Moose Lodge?</i>
<i>- No, no, little buddy. </i>

8
00:00:42,287 --> 00:00:46,280
<i>The ex-president of the United States!</i>
<i>Many say the most popular in history. </i>

9
00:00:46,487 --> 00:00:50,321
<i>- The first president divorced in office. </i>
<i>- And he's moving right here to... </i>

10
00:00:50,487 --> 00:00:52,398
<i>... Mooseport!</i>
<i>- Okay, we got a caller. </i>

11
00:00:54,047 --> 00:00:55,685
<i>- Can you name him?</i>
<i>- Eagle Cole?</i>

12
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:57,883
<i>- Monroe "Eagle" Cole!</i>
<i>- Monroe "Eagle" Cole!</i>

13
00:00:58,047 --> 00:00:59,958
<i>Congratulations, you're a winner. </i>

14
00:01:00,127 --> 00:01:02,357
- Morning, Handy.
- Morning, Kent. Looks good.

15
00:01:02,567 --> 00:01:05,479
- Yeah. Yeah. Morning, Harve.
- Morning, Kent.

16
00:01:05,647 --> 00:01:06,875
- Morning, Harve.
- Morning.

17
00:01:07,047 --> 00:01:08,560
- Morning, Harve.
- Morning, Morris.

18
00:01:08,727 --> 00:01:10,524
- Morning, Handy.
- Morning, Morris.

19
00:01:10,687 --> 00:01:13,121
- Morning, Reuben.
- Morning, Handy!

20
00:01:13,327 --> 00:01:15,522
- Morning, Stu, Morning, Fern.
- Morning, Handy.

21
00:01:17,647 --> 00:01:19,399
- New socks, Harve?
- Yeah.

22
00:01:19,607 --> 00:01:22,838
Yeah, I like them. I like them.
They go well with... each other.

23
00:01:23,047 --> 00:01:25,356
- Thanks.
- Morning, Handy.

24
00:01:25,527 --> 00:01:27,483
Hi, Mandy. I didn't see you there.

25
00:01:28,927 --> 00:01:30,883
Ready, boys? Get it together, now.

26
00:01:33,647 --> 00:01:35,956
Nice. Good job.

27
00:01:43,327 --> 00:01:46,046
- Morning.
- Morning, Irma.

28
00:01:54,647 --> 00:01:56,444
Come on, Plunger. There you go.

29
00:01:56,607 --> 00:01:58,245
- Hey, baby.
- Martha, good morning.

30
00:01:58,407 --> 00:02:00,318
6:30 is too damn early.

31
00:02:00,527 --> 00:02:04,361
It's not too early for Bruce, right?
Bruce doesn't care what time it is.

32
00:02:04,607 --> 00:02:07,963
- Bruce got a little morning breath going.
- Do you believe this?

33
00:02:08,127 --> 00:02:13,155
He decides to come a week early and
they expect us to get all that work done?

34
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:15,722
He's the president.
He usually gets what he wants.

35
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,645
We'll get it done.

36
00:02:17,807 --> 00:02:21,277
You know what I like about Bruce?
When he's here, my nose looks normal.

37
00:02:21,967 --> 00:02:24,765
Yeah, but his nose fits his face, boss.

38
00:02:25,727 --> 00:02:28,525
You're not funny, Bob. Let's go.

39
00:02:36,607 --> 00:02:38,518
- Hold, please.
- Hold on one second.

40
00:02:44,847 --> 00:02:46,803
Copy that. Go!

41
00:02:49,807 --> 00:02:51,399
Lucky bounce, Mr. President.

42
00:02:51,607 --> 00:02:55,043
Well, you know what they say:
I'd rather be lucky than good.

43
00:02:57,407 --> 00:02:59,637
Mr. President, what will you do next?

44
00:02:59,807 --> 00:03:02,765
Oh, so many offers, Chi Chi,
it's an embarrassment of riches.

45
00:03:03,007 --> 00:03:04,804
First, there's the Farewell World Tour.

46
00:03:04,967 --> 00:03:08,676
Chance for me to say goodbye and
thank you to all my wonderful friends.

47
00:03:08,927 --> 00:03:12,920
Writing my memoirs. And then I'm doing
something I haven't done in 26 years:

48
00:03:13,087 --> 00:03:16,682
Putting my feet up, reading a newspaper,
without interruptions.

49
00:03:16,927 --> 00:03:21,603
Sounds good. Settle back in that
beautiful place you have in Baltimore.

50
00:03:21,887 --> 00:03:23,559
Afraid the first lady got that one.

51
00:03:24,807 --> 00:03:27,162
- In the divorce.
- Oh, right.

52
00:03:27,327 --> 00:03:29,124
She got the best years of my life.

53
00:03:29,287 --> 00:03:31,926
But the one thing she won't get
is my title.

54
00:03:32,647 --> 00:03:33,921
To the house?

55
00:03:34,087 --> 00:03:36,362
No. The title "Mr. President. "

56
00:03:38,487 --> 00:03:43,163
Unless donkeys fly, they'll be calling me
Mr. President for the rest of my life.

57
00:03:43,327 --> 00:03:48,481
She can have Baltimore. I'm fine with my
lovely little summer place. Mooseport.

58
00:04:15,447 --> 00:04:18,280
<i>Four-Tango-X-ray. </i>
<i>Hold short of runway one-two. </i>

59
00:04:18,487 --> 00:04:22,196
<i>Sorry, Sally, we have the former</i>
<i>president of the United States on final. </i>

60
00:04:22,407 --> 00:04:24,602
<i>We've got orders to let him land first. </i>

61
00:04:24,767 --> 00:04:26,200
<i>- Hold short. </i>
- Damn it.

62
00:05:07,247 --> 00:05:10,239
Welcome to the Mooseport White House,
Mr. President.

63
00:05:11,567 --> 00:05:13,080
All secure.

64
00:05:13,807 --> 00:05:15,718
Home sweet home.

65
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:19,326
It gets more magnificent every year.

66
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:24,083
Take the dog for a pee, Grace.

67
00:05:26,847 --> 00:05:29,805
Oh, Jesus. It looks like
Tiger Woods' funeral.

68
00:05:30,047 --> 00:05:34,916
- There are these speaking engagements...
- I have to take a quick cabinet meeting.

69
00:05:41,687 --> 00:05:42,961
Get in there!

70
00:05:47,167 --> 00:05:50,557
Sir, sorry. Handy Harrison.
It's an honor to meet you, sir.

71
00:05:50,807 --> 00:05:52,604
- Get his weapon.
- Back off!

72
00:05:53,447 --> 00:05:56,041
- All right, sir?
- Fine. I didn't know a worker was here.

73
00:05:56,207 --> 00:05:58,357
- I'm a worker.
- I'm sure he's been checked out.

74
00:05:58,527 --> 00:06:01,564
- They checked me out.
- Yes. Everybody's been totally cleared.

75
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,877
I'll get out of here. Let me...

76
00:06:04,087 --> 00:06:06,965
- Boy, sorry.
- All clear.

77
00:06:07,127 --> 00:06:09,925
And I just want to say it's an honor
to work for you, really.

78
00:06:10,127 --> 00:06:11,685
- Thank you very much.
- All right.

79
00:06:13,567 --> 00:06:14,966
Well...

80
00:06:17,727 --> 00:06:19,399
...I did come in here for a reason.

81
00:06:19,767 --> 00:06:23,965
Oh, right! Sure.
Go right ahead. Yeah. Sorry.

82
00:06:26,127 --> 00:06:28,277
I'll get that. I'll fix all that.

83
00:06:28,767 --> 00:06:30,883
All that'll be fixed.

84
00:06:35,647 --> 00:06:37,160
President.

85
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,280
At last.

86
00:06:40,447 --> 00:06:42,722
Everyone, let's give the president
some privacy.

87
00:06:42,927 --> 00:06:46,363
- Right away.
- We can go over these offers anytime.

88
00:06:46,567 --> 00:06:48,444
Hold on! How's it coming?

89
00:06:48,607 --> 00:06:50,165
We're finalizing dates this week.

90
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:54,081
Twenty-six speaking engagements,
14 days, 120 thou per.

91
00:06:54,367 --> 00:06:55,641
And?

92
00:06:56,047 --> 00:06:57,480
Clinton got 100,000, sir.

93
00:06:57,647 --> 00:07:00,445
- And my autobiography?
- Random House is offering 14 mil.

94
00:07:00,727 --> 00:07:03,525
HarperCollins is at 13,
but is offering a better ghostwriter.

95
00:07:03,967 --> 00:07:05,719
- Here.
- Excellent. Keep working it.

96
00:07:05,927 --> 00:07:07,918
We're up to 147 honorary doctorates.

97
00:07:08,087 --> 00:07:10,885
Ninety-three offers to be on boards
of Fortune 500 companies.

98
00:07:11,087 --> 00:07:15,046
Soova Motors is offering $5 million to do
a car commercial to air only in Norway.

99
00:07:15,807 --> 00:07:18,685
And of course, the big enchilada.

100
00:07:20,287 --> 00:07:23,916
The Monroe "Eagle" Cole
Presidential Library.

101
00:07:24,647 --> 00:07:25,921
Oh, I like it.

102
00:07:26,327 --> 00:07:30,366
European rationalism interwoven
with American modernism.

103
00:07:30,527 --> 00:07:33,325
A metaphor of organic growth.

104
00:07:33,567 --> 00:07:37,321
A manmade mountain,
over which soars the eagle.

105
00:07:37,967 --> 00:07:40,925
It's fantastic.
Is it big enough?

106
00:07:41,087 --> 00:07:44,124
It's 40,000 square feet, sir.

107
00:07:44,327 --> 00:07:47,160
- And?
- Clinton's is 20,000, sir.

108
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:49,085
- Excellent.
- Mr. President...

109
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:52,478
...it's the former first lady, sir.
Shall I tell her you're out?

110
00:07:52,687 --> 00:07:54,279
No, no, no.

111
00:07:54,487 --> 00:07:56,205
You excuse me?

112
00:07:56,727 --> 00:07:58,524
Here he is, Mrs. Cole.

113
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:01,880
And the problem is...?

114
00:08:02,087 --> 00:08:05,397
As the man who has just gotten
the most lucrative speaking fees...

115
00:08:05,567 --> 00:08:08,604
...the biggest book deal,
the most board offers in history...

116
00:08:08,767 --> 00:08:10,086
...I would think you'd know.

117
00:08:10,247 --> 00:08:12,966
Come on, honey, you don't believe
all that nonsense, do you?

118
00:08:13,127 --> 00:08:15,721
No, Eagle, I believe it's just
the tip of the iceberg.

119
00:08:15,927 --> 00:08:17,565
Charlotte, lamb, we settled.

120
00:08:18,647 --> 00:08:21,559
Pioneers settle. We rested.

121
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:24,759
- Seven million. You're selling Mooseport.
<i>- Charlotte... </i>

122
00:08:24,967 --> 00:08:26,400
<i>It's a vacation home, Monroe. </i>

123
00:08:26,567 --> 00:08:28,603
You thieving, conniving, ungrateful...

124
00:08:28,767 --> 00:08:31,042
It's been a pleasure speaking with you,
Mrs. Cole.

125
00:08:31,207 --> 00:08:32,925
<i>- We'll call you back. </i>
- Yeah, you too.

126
00:08:33,087 --> 00:08:35,442
Try to talk some sense into him.

127
00:08:37,727 --> 00:08:39,877
- Seven million.
- It's a negotiation.

128
00:08:40,047 --> 00:08:42,436
You've handled dictators.
You've handled terrorists.

129
00:08:42,687 --> 00:08:45,076
Terrorists were easier. I swear to God.

130
00:08:49,007 --> 00:08:50,486
Breathe.

131
00:08:51,367 --> 00:08:54,040
Let the lawyers handle it. Breathe.

132
00:08:56,687 --> 00:08:58,040
Oh. I can...

133
00:08:58,527 --> 00:09:00,245
Oh, Grace, you're a miracle.

134
00:09:03,607 --> 00:09:05,438
Oh. Sorry.

135
00:09:05,647 --> 00:09:08,320
No, no, no. Come on in.
Can I help you?

136
00:09:08,527 --> 00:09:11,963
Yeah... Well, I don't mean to
disturb you. I'm all done in here.

137
00:09:13,327 --> 00:09:14,726
I mean, I'm done fixing it.

138
00:09:14,927 --> 00:09:18,715
That flushing you heard,
that's work-related, not personal.

139
00:09:22,447 --> 00:09:24,119
Hey, we're done.

140
00:09:25,567 --> 00:09:26,841
What...? Plunger!

141
00:09:28,407 --> 00:09:30,079
Plunger! Plunger, stop it!

142
00:09:31,367 --> 00:09:32,766
Come here!

143
00:09:35,087 --> 00:09:37,043
What are you doing, huh?

144
00:09:37,367 --> 00:09:39,323
Hey, you trying to get us both shot?

145
00:09:39,527 --> 00:09:43,202
How many times do I got to tell you?
Keep that thing in your... body.

146
00:09:43,407 --> 00:09:44,920
Bad dog.

147
00:09:46,767 --> 00:09:48,598
You let him do that in front of you?

148
00:09:48,807 --> 00:09:50,798
I don't have cable, man.

149
00:10:00,207 --> 00:10:02,675
Come on, boy. Come on.

150
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,679
Get them, get them.

151
00:10:11,087 --> 00:10:12,566
Sally?

152
00:10:14,927 --> 00:10:17,521
Spit it up, froggy. Thank you.

153
00:10:17,887 --> 00:10:20,606
Sally? You stay off her couch, Plunger.

154
00:10:20,767 --> 00:10:23,725
Sally? Sally? Hey, you up here?

155
00:10:23,927 --> 00:10:26,680
- Guess what?
- Downstairs.

156
00:10:27,007 --> 00:10:28,440
Guess what came?

157
00:10:28,647 --> 00:10:29,921
Jane Ellen's delivering.

158
00:10:30,127 --> 00:10:32,721
- Already? Wow. How's she doing?
- Here comes another one.

159
00:10:32,847 --> 00:10:34,121
She's up to sextuplets.

160
00:10:34,327 --> 00:10:36,079
Sextuplets?

161
00:10:36,607 --> 00:10:38,837
Seven, right? Six. Seven!

162
00:10:39,047 --> 00:10:40,639
No, six, six.

163
00:10:49,087 --> 00:10:50,884
Chester.

164
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,925
Aw, you did it, boy.

165
00:10:56,807 --> 00:10:59,719
Oh, boy. Oh, look at those paws.
It's going to be giant.

166
00:10:59,927 --> 00:11:01,519
I know.

167
00:11:09,247 --> 00:11:11,238
Hey, so guess who I saw today?

168
00:11:11,447 --> 00:11:12,766
- Who?
- Take a guess.

169
00:11:12,927 --> 00:11:14,326
- Handy.
- Come on.

170
00:11:14,487 --> 00:11:16,523
- Take one guess.
- The president.

171
00:11:17,847 --> 00:11:20,520
Oh, that's right because everybody
knows he's here.

172
00:11:20,727 --> 00:11:24,037
But not everybody gets a check
for 17,000 big ones.

173
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:27,199
- Really?
- Seventeen thousand.

174
00:11:27,407 --> 00:11:29,875
Man, you know what? I just...

175
00:11:30,847 --> 00:11:32,439
I think I'm finally ready.

176
00:11:37,567 --> 00:11:39,603
Where were those towels?

177
00:11:47,007 --> 00:11:48,679
You're ready?

178
00:11:49,247 --> 00:11:51,078
Yeah. Yeah.

179
00:11:52,127 --> 00:11:54,595
- Ready to...?
- To get the new truck.

180
00:11:54,807 --> 00:11:59,403
The big one. No more three trips to
the lumberyard for me. It'll be great.

181
00:11:59,647 --> 00:12:01,365
Dina, false alarm!

182
00:12:04,647 --> 00:12:06,000
I'll take him.

183
00:12:06,687 --> 00:12:08,439
I'm not sensing any enthusiasm.

184
00:12:08,607 --> 00:12:12,316
I'm thrilled about your
new truck. Really.

185
00:12:15,127 --> 00:12:18,881
You know what?
Tonight, after the party thing...

186
00:12:19,087 --> 00:12:21,555
...let's do something to celebrate.

187
00:12:21,767 --> 00:12:24,361
Let's just go out, me and you.
A little romantic dinner.

188
00:12:24,607 --> 00:12:27,440
- Sure.
- Yeah, it'll be great.

189
00:12:30,607 --> 00:12:33,724
Okay. All right.
Dina, say hi to Fred and the kids.

190
00:12:34,127 --> 00:12:36,641
All right. See you later.

191
00:12:36,847 --> 00:12:38,200
Plunger, let's go.

192
00:12:38,687 --> 00:12:43,317
Well, he needs a new truck so he can
load all that crap that he's full of.

193
00:12:58,967 --> 00:13:00,764
There he is!

194
00:13:07,207 --> 00:13:08,401
You look great, sir!

195
00:13:09,527 --> 00:13:11,165
Glad you're here, sir.

196
00:13:11,487 --> 00:13:13,682
- Good to see you, sir.
- Over here.

197
00:13:13,887 --> 00:13:15,684
Right here, Mr. President!

198
00:13:15,927 --> 00:13:17,838
We're happy to have you here, sir!

199
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:33,521
- Here we are.
- Martha, those look good.

200
00:13:33,727 --> 00:13:35,126
Morris! Morris!

201
00:13:35,927 --> 00:13:38,202
- What?
- He's here.

202
00:13:38,367 --> 00:13:40,801
Al, "Hail to the Chief".
"Hail to the Chief"!

203
00:13:45,887 --> 00:13:47,639
- Fifteen minutes.
- An hour.

204
00:13:47,847 --> 00:13:50,077
- Thirty.
- Forty-five and it's a deal.

205
00:13:59,847 --> 00:14:01,121
Sorry.

206
00:14:03,447 --> 00:14:06,359
Good evening.
I'd like to thank everybody for coming.

207
00:14:06,567 --> 00:14:09,684
Tonight is a very special night
for Mooseport.

208
00:14:09,847 --> 00:14:14,443
In the words of Hunt Langley, who put it
so eloquently in <i>The Moose Call</i>:

209
00:14:14,647 --> 00:14:17,036
"The Eagle has landed!"

210
00:14:19,087 --> 00:14:21,681
- How original.
- On behalf of the town council...

211
00:14:21,847 --> 00:14:25,556
...let's give a big Mooseport welcome
to our newest citizen...

212
00:14:25,807 --> 00:14:29,561
...Monroe "Eagle" Cole!

213
00:14:35,927 --> 00:14:37,724
Thank you. Thank you very much.

214
00:14:37,927 --> 00:14:41,522
As you all know, it's been over a year
since I vacationed up here.

215
00:14:41,687 --> 00:14:45,202
So first off, to the rumor
that I'm only here...

216
00:14:45,407 --> 00:14:49,366
...because I lost my Baltimore house
in my divorce...

217
00:14:50,087 --> 00:14:51,486
...absolutely true.

218
00:14:52,807 --> 00:14:54,638
I am a Mooseport resident.

219
00:14:54,847 --> 00:14:58,362
Even though I didn't get to meet many
of you when I was here as president...

220
00:14:58,567 --> 00:15:00,125
...I certainly hope to...

221
00:15:05,247 --> 00:15:06,805
I certainly would...

222
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:11,245
...hope to get to know you all
a lot better.

223
00:15:11,447 --> 00:15:15,122
Maybe we could hit a few birdies
or eagles...

224
00:15:16,087 --> 00:15:17,361
...at your local golf links.

225
00:15:17,527 --> 00:15:20,644
Anyway, since I'm not here
to ask for money...

226
00:15:22,647 --> 00:15:24,399
...I don't know what else to say...

227
00:15:24,567 --> 00:15:28,924
...except to thank you so much
for your hospitality...

228
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:31,519
...and see you around the burg.

229
00:15:36,167 --> 00:15:40,558
Thanks, Mr. President. That was great.
Can some of us talk with you privately?

230
00:15:40,727 --> 00:15:43,082
The president's time is limited. Sorry.

231
00:15:43,247 --> 00:15:46,000
This'll just take a second, sir.
It's kind of urgent.

232
00:15:46,167 --> 00:15:47,486
Certainly.

233
00:15:47,647 --> 00:15:49,365
- Right this way.
- Excuse me.

234
00:15:53,047 --> 00:15:56,244
Mr. President, I'm sorry the timing
isn't better...

235
00:15:56,447 --> 00:15:59,359
...but your arrival has coincided
with something of a crisis.

236
00:15:59,927 --> 00:16:03,044
Folks, I'm The Crisismeister.
Shall I call the Marines?

237
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:08,999
- Would you care to sit down, please?
- Thank you.

238
00:16:10,087 --> 00:16:15,161
Mr. President, Amos Harmon, our
beloved mayor of 24 years, passed away.

239
00:16:15,367 --> 00:16:16,641
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

240
00:16:16,807 --> 00:16:21,198
Anyway, sir, the town council met
an hour ago in an emergency session...

241
00:16:21,367 --> 00:16:23,005
...and voted unanimously...

242
00:16:23,207 --> 00:16:26,836
...to beseech you, sir,
to be our mayor.

243
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:29,679
Your mayor?

244
00:16:30,487 --> 00:16:32,364
Mayor.

245
00:16:34,527 --> 00:16:36,279
That's good.

246
00:16:36,767 --> 00:16:38,997
Yes, sir. You see, before he died...

247
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:41,840
...Mayor Harmon was running,
as always, unopposed.

248
00:16:42,007 --> 00:16:44,077
And with the filing deadline tomorrow...

249
00:16:44,247 --> 00:16:47,159
...we were having a dilly of a time
finding a replacement.

250
00:16:47,327 --> 00:16:50,239
Then Reuben here pipes up and says,
"Why not get the president?"

251
00:16:50,407 --> 00:16:52,159
I said, "Get the president!"

252
00:16:52,367 --> 00:16:56,406
In our 240-year history there would be
no greater honor bestowed on our town.

253
00:16:56,567 --> 00:16:59,798
To have as our mayor,
the most popular president in history.

254
00:16:59,967 --> 00:17:02,322
- Approval ratings in the 70s.
- Eighties, actually.

255
00:17:02,487 --> 00:17:03,806
- Eighty-five.
- Eighty-five.

256
00:17:04,007 --> 00:17:05,884
Eighty-five. Unbelievable.

257
00:17:06,087 --> 00:17:09,443
Mr. President, you simply must say yes.

258
00:17:09,687 --> 00:17:14,681
Well, folks, even though I'm not in the
Oval Office any longer, I do have plans.

259
00:17:15,887 --> 00:17:18,879
Sally, please. We're in the middle
of something here.

260
00:17:19,087 --> 00:17:21,043
Sorry. I was just...

261
00:17:22,047 --> 00:17:23,605
...getting my coat.
I'll come back.

262
00:17:24,527 --> 00:17:25,926
Hold on a second.

263
00:17:26,127 --> 00:17:27,640
- Sally, is it?
- Yes.

264
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:30,486
Sally, you seem like
an engaged citizen.

265
00:17:31,087 --> 00:17:33,078
What would you think about
my being mayor?

266
00:17:33,647 --> 00:17:36,559
- Mayor? Really?
- It was my idea!

267
00:17:39,127 --> 00:17:41,004
I think you should do it.

268
00:17:41,167 --> 00:17:45,206
And then maybe you could do
something about that landing situation.

269
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:48,923
- The landing situation.
- Yeah. I'm a veterinarian...

270
00:17:49,127 --> 00:17:52,722
...and I had a critically ill donkey
in my helicopter this morning...

271
00:17:53,327 --> 00:17:55,397
...and I almost lost her...

272
00:17:56,407 --> 00:17:59,763
...because the president
just had to land first.

273
00:17:59,927 --> 00:18:02,885
I'm sorry. I didn't realize.
Must've been a procedural thing.

274
00:18:03,087 --> 00:18:05,681
- Standard security protocol, sir.
- Standard security.

275
00:18:05,887 --> 00:18:08,799
Maybe if you were mayor
you could do something about that.

276
00:18:10,567 --> 00:18:13,798
Absolutely. Things like that
shouldn't happen.

277
00:18:14,007 --> 00:18:15,326
I appreciate your opinion.

278
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:18,963
- It's nice to meet you, Mr. President.
- Nice to meet you too, Sally.

279
00:18:20,687 --> 00:18:23,485
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

280
00:18:25,967 --> 00:18:28,879
- Well, Mr. President?
- I'm sorry, gentlemen, it's just...

281
00:18:29,047 --> 00:18:31,003
Hold on a second there, Bullard. Maybe...

282
00:18:31,207 --> 00:18:34,756
Excuse me, Mr. President. I suggest
that we give them an answer tomorrow.

283
00:18:34,927 --> 00:18:36,246
Gentlemen, he'll sleep on it.

284
00:18:37,327 --> 00:18:38,806
Yes, I'll sleep on it.

285
00:18:39,007 --> 00:18:41,362
So we'll hear from you
in the morning, sir?

286
00:18:41,527 --> 00:18:44,325
You have my word.
You have the Eagle's word.

287
00:18:45,047 --> 00:18:46,321
Thank you, Mr. President.

288
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:51,485
By God, that's just the way
he sounds on TV!

289
00:18:56,407 --> 00:18:59,604
Sorry. Connelly's septic tank
broke again.

290
00:18:59,807 --> 00:19:01,206
Stood up for a septic tank.

291
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:03,125
No. No, you look good.

292
00:19:03,287 --> 00:19:04,686
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

293
00:19:07,607 --> 00:19:09,040
- What?
- You stink!

294
00:19:09,207 --> 00:19:12,916
- Too much cologne? Yeah?
- No. Did you think about a shower?

295
00:19:13,127 --> 00:19:15,322
Yes, but then I would've been more late.

296
00:19:15,527 --> 00:19:17,597
And I didn't think it was bad.

297
00:19:17,807 --> 00:19:21,356
You know how you can't smell your
own smell? I think that's what it is.

298
00:19:21,567 --> 00:19:23,159
So is this thing over?

299
00:19:23,607 --> 00:19:25,359
It's over for me.

300
00:19:25,847 --> 00:19:27,485
You want to get something to eat?

301
00:19:27,687 --> 00:19:29,837
I'm not hungry. I think I'll go home.

302
00:19:30,047 --> 00:19:31,844
Wait. Come on. Is it that bad?

303
00:19:32,047 --> 00:19:34,481
I'll take a shower.
We can take a shower.

304
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,406
I already took a shower.

305
00:19:36,567 --> 00:19:38,364
Come on, Sally, what's the problem?

306
00:19:38,567 --> 00:19:40,523
I don't know. I'm just...

307
00:19:40,887 --> 00:19:43,117
You know, for the past six years...

308
00:19:44,607 --> 00:19:47,405
Today, when you said you were...

309
00:19:51,207 --> 00:19:54,483
I don't know, Handy. Why don't you
tell me what the problem is.

310
00:19:55,807 --> 00:19:59,925
- I don't have a problem.
- Well, that's the problem.

311
00:20:00,727 --> 00:20:03,036
- Well, what do you...?
- I'll see you tomorrow.

312
00:20:07,047 --> 00:20:09,163
I should have showered.

313
00:20:13,887 --> 00:20:15,684
- Good morning.
- Beautiful, Ramona.

314
00:20:15,927 --> 00:20:17,883
- Today's agenda, ma'am.
- Thank you, John.

315
00:20:18,087 --> 00:20:19,725
Perfect, Smitty.

316
00:20:20,007 --> 00:20:22,646
For God's sake,
save me from Mooseport, Rod.

317
00:20:23,127 --> 00:20:25,163
How about a job at the Pentagon?

318
00:20:25,327 --> 00:20:28,285
Gotta go.
Morning, Mr. President.

319
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:38,516
Good morning, good morning.
Oh, Smitty, thank you so much.

320
00:20:38,727 --> 00:20:40,080
What's on tap today?

321
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:41,880
Read the paper.

322
00:20:42,087 --> 00:20:43,839
Finally. Grace, you're wonderful.

323
00:20:44,007 --> 00:20:46,521
Then you can take that jog
you've been wanting to take.

324
00:20:46,727 --> 00:20:48,445
Fabulous.

325
00:20:49,527 --> 00:20:50,801
About that mayor thing...

326
00:20:50,967 --> 00:20:52,878
Don't worry, we'll take care of it.

327
00:20:53,047 --> 00:20:55,845
"While the president is flattered,
he respectfully declines.

328
00:20:56,087 --> 00:20:58,999
- His schedule precludes him... "
- Actually, I'm considering it.

329
00:21:00,167 --> 00:21:01,725
Sir?

330
00:21:01,887 --> 00:21:03,206
Yeah, why not?

331
00:21:03,367 --> 00:21:06,040
Largely ceremonial.
Any work involved, you can do.

332
00:21:06,247 --> 00:21:08,363
We run everything else
we're involved in.

333
00:21:08,527 --> 00:21:10,643
- Why not Mooseport?
- Well, sir...

334
00:21:10,847 --> 00:21:13,998
As your first move out of office
you become mayor?

335
00:21:14,207 --> 00:21:17,836
It's beneath you.
And from a P.R. Standpoint it's...

336
00:21:18,007 --> 00:21:19,406
Fantastic.

337
00:21:20,287 --> 00:21:22,596
"For the love of public service,
Eagle Cole...

338
00:21:22,767 --> 00:21:26,885
...the most beloved president since
Jack Kennedy, agrees to help. " Perfect.

339
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:29,443
Don't forget the Wicked Witch
of the West Wing.

340
00:21:29,607 --> 00:21:32,485
She can't claim this is a vacation
house if I'm mayor, can she?

341
00:21:32,647 --> 00:21:34,000
True.

342
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:37,239
Wait until the filing deadline
and then call with the good news.

343
00:21:37,407 --> 00:21:38,999
Yes, sir.

344
00:21:39,607 --> 00:21:42,644
There. We're going to run "Turdport. "

345
00:21:56,807 --> 00:22:00,083
Thank you very much, gentlemen.
I won't let Mooseport down.

346
00:22:00,287 --> 00:22:02,198
You have the Eagle's word. Okay?

347
00:22:02,567 --> 00:22:05,365
- Thank you, Mr. President. Goodbye.
<i>- Bye. </i>

348
00:22:05,527 --> 00:22:06,846
It was my idea!

349
00:22:07,007 --> 00:22:11,558
- Congratulations, Kent.
- Morris, you might want to read this.

350
00:22:13,687 --> 00:22:15,359
Holy crap!

351
00:22:16,047 --> 00:22:18,003
Thanks for meeting with us again, sir.

352
00:22:18,167 --> 00:22:21,523
When we talked last night,
nobody else had put in for mayor.

353
00:22:21,687 --> 00:22:24,599
Well, unbeknownst to us, Irma Brisker,
our town registrar...

354
00:22:24,807 --> 00:22:28,117
...took it upon herself to persuade
Harold Harrison...

355
00:22:28,327 --> 00:22:30,045
You may know him
as Handy Harrison.

356
00:22:30,247 --> 00:22:33,125
Runs the hardware store.
Doing construction work on your home.

357
00:22:33,367 --> 00:22:34,880
...to run for mayor as well.

358
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:38,363
Okay, then. You've got your mayor.
If he wants it, he can have it.

359
00:22:38,527 --> 00:22:40,757
It's a touch more complicated than that.

360
00:22:40,967 --> 00:22:42,241
What's complicated?

361
00:22:42,407 --> 00:22:46,525
It's just that... See, sir, it kind of got out
in the press that you're both in.

362
00:22:47,047 --> 00:22:48,958
- What press?
- Well...

363
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:52,204
When the deadline passed we called
Hunt Langley at <i>The Moose Call. </i>

364
00:22:52,367 --> 00:22:55,006
He said when this got around,
it would be national news.

365
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:58,517
Of course it'll be news.
Press'll say I'm trying to squash a bug.

366
00:22:58,727 --> 00:23:02,083
Rest assured, sir, not one of them
said anything like that.

367
00:23:02,287 --> 00:23:04,118
- Did they, Stu?
- None of them said that.

368
00:23:04,327 --> 00:23:07,046
A couple called it, "David and Goliath,"
but none said that.

369
00:23:07,247 --> 00:23:08,885
- What do you mean, "them"? Who?
- NBC.

370
00:23:09,127 --> 00:23:11,641
- CBS.
- FOX. It was really exciting.

371
00:23:13,087 --> 00:23:14,679
You telling me
the entire country...

372
00:23:14,847 --> 00:23:18,044
...thinks I'm running for mayor
against the man installing my toilet?

373
00:23:19,487 --> 00:23:21,762
But, sir, you said, "Eagle's word. "

374
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:23,605
Aw, hell!

375
00:23:27,727 --> 00:23:30,195
Stop eating the fertilizer.
Go on over there.

376
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:32,085
- Look, it's the president!
- He's here!

377
00:23:32,247 --> 00:23:34,203
Which car is he in?

378
00:23:35,487 --> 00:23:38,320
Company's coming.
And Bruce is out again.

379
00:23:38,487 --> 00:23:40,762
- What is this?
- That's Bruce the moose, sir.

380
00:23:40,967 --> 00:23:43,401
It's a rescued animal. Handy's pet.

381
00:23:43,567 --> 00:23:45,125
Shouldn't it be in a zoo?

382
00:23:50,967 --> 00:23:53,083
- Afternoon, Mr. President.
- Oh, hello, Handy.

383
00:23:53,287 --> 00:23:55,198
Is everything okay
with that water heater?

384
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:57,437
It's all fine.
I wondered if you had a minute.

385
00:23:57,647 --> 00:24:00,241
- I'm Bob. I'm working for you too.
- Bob, nice to see you.

386
00:24:00,407 --> 00:24:03,046
Sorry, Mr. President.
Bob, Martha and Irma.

387
00:24:03,207 --> 00:24:05,198
- Martha. Irma.
- Paint.

388
00:24:05,367 --> 00:24:06,766
- Pipes.
- Wood products.

389
00:24:06,927 --> 00:24:08,963
Like your last two
Cabinet appointments.

390
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:14,400
- Aren't you going to introduce me?
- Oh, sorry. This is Mandy.

391
00:24:14,727 --> 00:24:17,036
Mandy and Handy. How cute.

392
00:24:17,647 --> 00:24:20,081
Could we speak privately
for a moment?

393
00:24:20,247 --> 00:24:23,364
Yeah, sure. That's my office
right over there.

394
00:24:23,567 --> 00:24:24,886
Outstanding.

395
00:24:27,807 --> 00:24:31,163
Excuse me. I have a private meeting
with the president.

396
00:24:38,807 --> 00:24:41,196
Iguana on your left, sir.

397
00:24:45,927 --> 00:24:47,280
What a dump.

398
00:24:47,447 --> 00:24:49,756
Well, sir, this is it.

399
00:24:50,007 --> 00:24:51,918
Oh, it's cozy. Nice office.

400
00:24:52,087 --> 00:24:53,839
Thank you. How can I help you?

401
00:24:54,007 --> 00:24:56,965
Well, Handy, as I'm sure you know,
we've both put in for mayor.

402
00:24:57,167 --> 00:24:58,998
- No, I didn't know that.
- You didn't?

403
00:24:59,207 --> 00:25:02,358
I knew that I put in. I thought
I was just doing the town a favor.

404
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:04,717
I thought I was running all by myself.

405
00:25:04,887 --> 00:25:06,957
As you can see,
we have a bit of a situation.

406
00:25:07,167 --> 00:25:09,840
Yeah. We got a bit of a pickle here.

407
00:25:10,007 --> 00:25:13,363
Bit of a pickle, exactly. So I thought
that one of us should withdraw.

408
00:25:13,567 --> 00:25:15,364
I would be happy if it were me.

409
00:25:15,767 --> 00:25:19,919
Lord knows I have nothing left to prove,
much less being the mayor of anything.

410
00:25:20,087 --> 00:25:22,157
But I have a P.R. Problem.

411
00:25:22,367 --> 00:25:24,801
A P.R. Pro...? Is it serious?

412
00:25:25,007 --> 00:25:28,079
Well, it got out to the press
that I had given my word.

413
00:25:28,287 --> 00:25:30,164
- Oh, right.
- You know.

414
00:25:30,327 --> 00:25:32,079
"You have the Eagle's word. "

415
00:25:32,287 --> 00:25:35,085
- Right, like on TV.
- TV. Exactly.

416
00:25:35,287 --> 00:25:37,676
So... Well, look...

417
00:25:38,567 --> 00:25:41,365
...you're a golfer, right?
Are you any good?

418
00:25:41,527 --> 00:25:44,564
I get around. I'm like a 10 handicap,
maybe, on a good day.

419
00:25:44,767 --> 00:25:46,723
Ten? Me too.
We should play sometime.

420
00:25:46,927 --> 00:25:48,246
That would be an honor, sir.

421
00:25:48,407 --> 00:25:51,604
Well, if you're trying to make
a name for yourself in golf...

422
00:25:51,807 --> 00:25:53,604
...you wouldn't start off by...

423
00:25:54,967 --> 00:25:56,639
Nice shot.

424
00:25:57,127 --> 00:25:59,846
...challenging Tiger Woods.
No, you'd start small.

425
00:26:00,047 --> 00:26:02,277
Local tournaments. Same in politics.

426
00:26:02,447 --> 00:26:04,165
You don't start a political career...

427
00:26:04,327 --> 00:26:07,125
...running against the former
president of the United States.

428
00:26:07,287 --> 00:26:09,596
- Fine.
- Fine?

429
00:26:09,887 --> 00:26:13,243
It was a privilege to run.
It's a privilege to withdraw.

430
00:26:15,527 --> 00:26:17,165
- Well, it's settled.
- What's settled?

431
00:26:17,327 --> 00:26:20,364
It turns out we both put in for mayor,
so I just withdrew.

432
00:26:20,527 --> 00:26:23,166
- Chicken.
- I'm glad I helped with the P.R. Problem.

433
00:26:23,607 --> 00:26:26,360
Bruce is out of his pen again.
Did anybody happen to notice?

434
00:26:26,567 --> 00:26:29,206
No, he chewed through the rope.
Bob, put him back.

435
00:26:29,367 --> 00:26:31,119
I already did it.

436
00:26:32,167 --> 00:26:33,441
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

437
00:26:33,607 --> 00:26:36,041
Sally, the president.
We just had a meeting.

438
00:26:36,207 --> 00:26:38,198
We met last night,
when I was stood up.

439
00:26:39,847 --> 00:26:43,283
Look, I'm sorry if I was rude to you.
I'm really embarrassed.

440
00:26:43,447 --> 00:26:45,039
Rude? Don't be silly. No.

441
00:26:45,207 --> 00:26:48,165
In fact, what you said helped
convince me to be mayor.

442
00:26:48,327 --> 00:26:50,397
- Really?
- So you're gonna do it?

443
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:53,161
- You're going to be our mayor. Great.
- It is, isn't it?

444
00:26:53,367 --> 00:26:57,042
I'm so glad I ran into you.
You know, I've decided to get a dog.

445
00:26:57,247 --> 00:26:58,726
I thought you already had a dog.

446
00:26:58,967 --> 00:27:00,480
I do. A great animal.

447
00:27:00,727 --> 00:27:02,001
- A Shih Tzu.
- Westie.

448
00:27:02,167 --> 00:27:04,158
Westie needs a friend.

449
00:27:04,367 --> 00:27:08,326
And I thought if you were available,
let's say, tomorrow night, perhaps...

450
00:27:09,047 --> 00:27:12,084
...we could discuss it over dinner.
- Dinner?

451
00:27:13,687 --> 00:27:17,680
Yeah. I could really use your
professional advice on this.

452
00:27:17,887 --> 00:27:19,798
Really? My advice?

453
00:27:20,087 --> 00:27:22,965
Okay. Well, yeah. Dinner would be fine.

454
00:27:23,167 --> 00:27:26,716
Great. Looking forward to it. My people
will get in touch with your people.

455
00:27:26,927 --> 00:27:30,522
I don't have people,
but I could give you my number.

456
00:27:30,727 --> 00:27:34,197
Well, my people will get your number,
and we'll set up a time.

457
00:27:34,847 --> 00:27:38,157
And I'm sure whatever time we do set,
you'll be on time.

458
00:27:38,487 --> 00:27:41,320
Absolutely. Looking forward to it.

459
00:27:43,607 --> 00:27:44,926
See you on the links, sir.

460
00:27:45,727 --> 00:27:47,957
- And thanks again for being so helpful.
- Right.

461
00:27:50,607 --> 00:27:52,404
You mean rolling over.

462
00:27:59,207 --> 00:28:03,166
You know, Bruce is a baby.
Babies like to chew things, like rope.

463
00:28:07,687 --> 00:28:09,484
- Uh-oh.
- Okay.

464
00:28:14,047 --> 00:28:15,446
Sally...

465
00:28:15,607 --> 00:28:19,919
...is it me, or did you just
get asked out...

466
00:28:20,127 --> 00:28:21,560
...by that president guy?

467
00:28:22,487 --> 00:28:25,638
Yes, I think I did. Probably couldn't
chew through this, right?

468
00:28:26,327 --> 00:28:30,957
And is it me or did you just say yes
to the president guy?

469
00:28:32,367 --> 00:28:33,641
Yes, I think I did.

470
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:39,998
I'm sorry that I was late. But you can't
date the president because of that.

471
00:28:40,167 --> 00:28:43,364
- Do you really think that's the reason?
- Why, then?

472
00:28:44,287 --> 00:28:45,959
Why not?

473
00:28:47,007 --> 00:28:48,759
Here, use this.

474
00:28:55,527 --> 00:28:57,199
Shut up!

475
00:28:58,807 --> 00:29:02,402
Sally, I want to talk to you.
Sally, I want to talk! What...?

476
00:29:02,647 --> 00:29:05,286
Thank you very much.
It's very nice of you too.

477
00:29:05,487 --> 00:29:07,284
- Say goodbye, honey.
- It's Irene.

478
00:29:08,407 --> 00:29:10,363
Mr. President!

479
00:29:10,967 --> 00:29:12,958
Yes, Handy, what is it?

480
00:29:14,327 --> 00:29:16,602
- Mr. President!
- Thank you very much.

481
00:29:23,647 --> 00:29:26,480
I can't do it, sir.
I can't drop out of the mayor race.

482
00:29:27,607 --> 00:29:29,086
Excuse me?

483
00:29:29,247 --> 00:29:32,876
I don't have the Eagle thing like you,
but I'm a man of my word too.

484
00:29:33,087 --> 00:29:36,477
And every man's word's important.
Isn't that true?

485
00:29:36,687 --> 00:29:38,325
Does he want money? What is it?

486
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:42,566
If you stay in this race then I'm sure
you're going to slaughter me...

487
00:29:43,367 --> 00:29:46,916
...but I'm running for
the mayor of Mooseport.

488
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,004
Is he losing his mind?

489
00:30:03,007 --> 00:30:04,281
What just happened?

490
00:30:04,447 --> 00:30:06,324
You're running against the president.

491
00:30:06,487 --> 00:30:09,365
And your girlfriend's dating him.
Mm-hm.

492
00:30:10,407 --> 00:30:12,238
I repeat, "Mm-hm. "

493
00:30:14,327 --> 00:30:15,965
<i>Larry, the president has no comment. </i>

494
00:30:16,447 --> 00:30:18,324
No, no comment. Thank you.

495
00:30:18,887 --> 00:30:21,685
That's all the networks, <i>60 Minutes</i>,
and Larry King.

496
00:30:22,167 --> 00:30:25,443
The handyman's girlfriend?
Why didn't you tell me?

497
00:30:25,647 --> 00:30:28,719
- I'm gonna look like an idiot.
- I tried to tell you, remember?

498
00:30:28,927 --> 00:30:30,360
Why didn't you try harder?

499
00:30:30,567 --> 00:30:34,242
What am I supposed to do now,
apologize? Back down?

500
00:30:34,487 --> 00:30:35,806
You wanna call Bert Langdon?

501
00:30:36,007 --> 00:30:38,805
For what? I don't need
a campaign manager for this.

502
00:30:39,607 --> 00:30:41,120
Hello...

503
00:30:41,447 --> 00:30:42,800
One second. Mr. President?

504
00:30:43,287 --> 00:30:45,323
Bert Langdon on line one.

505
00:30:48,127 --> 00:30:50,960
Bert. What a coincidence.
What's shaking?

506
00:30:51,327 --> 00:30:53,318
<i>That's what I was going to ask you. </i>

507
00:30:53,487 --> 00:30:55,000
It's deader than Nixon down here.

508
00:30:55,167 --> 00:30:58,159
I'd be happy to roll up my sleeves
and come up there if you want.

509
00:30:58,367 --> 00:31:01,040
I'm running against my plumber.
Something I don't know?

510
00:31:01,207 --> 00:31:02,640
You watching FOX news?

511
00:31:04,167 --> 00:31:05,805
<i>The results are quite interesting. </i>

512
00:31:06,007 --> 00:31:10,523
<i>The poll is preliminary, but it does</i>
<i>show Harrison with surprising strength. </i>

513
00:31:10,687 --> 00:31:13,599
<i>There's an eight-percent margin</i>
<i>of error and it's still early... </i>

514
00:31:13,767 --> 00:31:16,156
<i>... but it looks to be very close. </i>

515
00:31:16,327 --> 00:31:19,319
<i>Seems to me the president's got himself</i>
<i>in a bit of a horse race. </i>

516
00:31:19,767 --> 00:31:21,359
Eagle, you with me?

517
00:31:21,567 --> 00:31:23,444
<i>Don't you mean, "moose race"?</i>

518
00:31:23,607 --> 00:31:24,881
<i>Eagle!</i>

519
00:31:28,207 --> 00:31:31,119
- There she is.
- That's her right there.

520
00:31:31,887 --> 00:31:33,639
Miss Mannis? Are you Dr. Sally Mannis?

521
00:31:33,807 --> 00:31:35,638
- Yeah.
- A question about Handy Harrison.

522
00:31:35,847 --> 00:31:38,236
You've been seeing Mr. Harrison
for six years?

523
00:31:38,447 --> 00:31:40,438
- And now you're dating the president?
- No.

524
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:43,485
I'm not dating the president.
It's one date.

525
00:31:43,647 --> 00:31:45,444
I'm not even sure you'd call it a date.

526
00:31:45,647 --> 00:31:47,842
Wouldn't call it a date.
What would you call it?

527
00:31:48,007 --> 00:31:49,360
A couple more questions.

528
00:31:49,567 --> 00:31:51,285
When did he ask you out?

529
00:31:51,527 --> 00:31:54,564
- Have you and the president had sex yet?
- For God's sakes.

530
00:31:55,487 --> 00:31:57,159
Come on. Come on. Let's go.

531
00:31:59,207 --> 00:32:00,481
Think about it, Handy.

532
00:32:00,647 --> 00:32:04,037
For our mayor, we could have
the president of the United States.

533
00:32:04,247 --> 00:32:07,125
- What are you trying to do to us?
- You know he's gonna win.

534
00:32:07,287 --> 00:32:10,085
- Drop out, you bastard!
- Thank you, Reuben.

535
00:32:10,327 --> 00:32:13,364
And you better keep an eye
on your speedometer, Harrison.

536
00:32:13,567 --> 00:32:15,285
Handy! Handy!
Handy! Handy!

537
00:32:15,447 --> 00:32:18,041
What's this? Come on.
What's going on?

538
00:32:18,207 --> 00:32:21,040
What's it look like?
You're campaigning.

539
00:32:22,007 --> 00:32:23,998
Hey, guys. Come on.

540
00:32:24,247 --> 00:32:26,477
Hey, Handy. Do you like it?

541
00:32:26,647 --> 00:32:28,478
That's... Yeah.

542
00:32:28,647 --> 00:32:31,036
Guys, thank you.
And the moose hat and everything.

543
00:32:31,287 --> 00:32:33,517
But, Irma, we discussed this.

544
00:32:33,687 --> 00:32:36,076
I'm not campaigning. I'm not.

545
00:32:43,647 --> 00:32:45,956
- What?
- Do you care about Sally or not?

546
00:32:47,207 --> 00:32:51,997
Look, her going out with him
is just a casual...

547
00:32:53,167 --> 00:32:55,761
Call it postmenopausal intuition...

548
00:32:55,927 --> 00:32:57,326
...but just my opinion...

549
00:32:57,527 --> 00:33:00,803
...lose this election, lose Sally.

550
00:33:01,007 --> 00:33:04,158
It won't go anywhere.
He's, like, 20 years older than me.

551
00:33:04,367 --> 00:33:06,961
- He's the president.
- So?

552
00:33:07,127 --> 00:33:09,721
Power takes 10 years off a man, Handy.

553
00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:11,798
Rich, another 10.

554
00:33:12,007 --> 00:33:15,158
By the time you figure he's in great
shape and you're not...

555
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:17,283
...he's younger than you are.

556
00:33:18,887 --> 00:33:22,084
So you want to campaign or not?

557
00:33:25,887 --> 00:33:27,366
"Better shape. "

558
00:33:28,407 --> 00:33:30,443
I know I can kick your ass.

559
00:33:30,807 --> 00:33:33,116
Up and running.
So how do we kick this off, Bert?

560
00:33:33,327 --> 00:33:36,797
Top priority, obviously,
is to keep him presidential.

561
00:33:37,007 --> 00:33:39,237
Just pound these moose worshipers...

562
00:33:39,447 --> 00:33:43,201
...with what his unbelievable experience
can bring to them.

563
00:33:43,407 --> 00:33:45,398
If they think about it
for half a second...

564
00:33:45,567 --> 00:33:50,277
...Harrison can't bring even a fraction
of what he brings. Whatever he is.

565
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:52,125
And what exactly is he?

566
00:33:52,287 --> 00:33:53,561
Preliminary research says...

567
00:33:53,767 --> 00:33:59,046
...that he is something that actually
we've never faced before, Mr. President.

568
00:33:59,207 --> 00:34:02,438
- And that is...?
- He's a genuinely honest man, sir.

569
00:34:02,687 --> 00:34:06,566
Oh, come on, Grace. All that means
is he's never run for public office.

570
00:34:08,687 --> 00:34:09,961
What do you got, Bert?

571
00:34:10,127 --> 00:34:12,595
FBI, CIA, nothing.

572
00:34:13,207 --> 00:34:15,437
But this turned up in the local paper.

573
00:34:15,607 --> 00:34:17,484
And that's it?

574
00:34:17,687 --> 00:34:21,646
That's it. We're running against
the pie-eating champ.

575
00:34:23,967 --> 00:34:25,286
And think about this:

576
00:34:25,487 --> 00:34:28,320
He runs for mayor, but only
when he thinks he's unopposed.

577
00:34:28,487 --> 00:34:32,958
He dates the same woman for six years,
but he never pops the question.

578
00:34:34,087 --> 00:34:35,839
What's wrong with this picture?

579
00:34:36,607 --> 00:34:39,679
He won't take risks.
He won't make a commitment.

580
00:34:40,127 --> 00:34:43,517
Any man who won't make a commitment
shouldn't be mayor of anything.

581
00:34:43,727 --> 00:34:47,163
- That's good. How do we get that out?
- Whisper campaign at first.

582
00:34:47,367 --> 00:34:48,641
Then radio.

583
00:34:48,807 --> 00:34:53,164
Eventually we'll have to have TV spots.
Shouldn't get too expensive, but...

584
00:34:54,567 --> 00:34:58,560
Sir, I'm sure you don't wanna hear this.
But would the easiest thing be...?

585
00:34:58,767 --> 00:35:00,519
Should we discuss a withdrawal?

586
00:35:00,767 --> 00:35:02,439
Withdrawal?

587
00:35:02,687 --> 00:35:05,599
Grace, he's the Eagle.

588
00:35:05,807 --> 00:35:09,959
Eagle Cole has never run away
from anything in his life!

589
00:35:10,207 --> 00:35:12,801
- Not to mention the effect on finances.
- Finances?

590
00:35:12,927 --> 00:35:15,964
Book deals, corporate boards,
library fundraising.

591
00:35:16,207 --> 00:35:18,118
You quit or lose to a plumber...

592
00:35:18,287 --> 00:35:21,006
...we can kiss the deals goodbye
before you say Roto-Rooter.

593
00:35:21,647 --> 00:35:24,366
This is not about Mooseport.
It's about winning.

594
00:35:24,567 --> 00:35:27,240
It's about spending 3 million dollars
to protect 20.

595
00:35:27,407 --> 00:35:29,682
Maybe I should commit
to that speaking tour.

596
00:35:31,167 --> 00:35:32,282
L... I, uh...

597
00:35:33,167 --> 00:35:34,680
I had to cancel that, sir.

598
00:35:34,847 --> 00:35:36,678
You what?

599
00:35:36,887 --> 00:35:40,436
It seemed obvious. It was right
in the middle of the campaign and...

600
00:35:40,647 --> 00:35:42,285
That was millions of dollars.

601
00:35:42,487 --> 00:35:45,604
Well, sir, there is still that offer
from the Soova Motors people.

602
00:35:45,767 --> 00:35:48,645
The ex-president of the United States
can't do car commercials.

603
00:35:48,847 --> 00:35:50,838
But have you seen the car? Look.

604
00:35:51,047 --> 00:35:53,959
It's snappy styling, snappy president.

605
00:35:54,207 --> 00:35:55,845
- And smooth handling...
- Bullard.

606
00:35:56,047 --> 00:35:58,197
...leather interior.
- Bullard, get out.

607
00:35:58,367 --> 00:36:00,597
- Get out. Get out.
- I'll handle the money, Eagle.

608
00:36:00,767 --> 00:36:03,645
I'm sure that with the library pledges,
something will turn up.

609
00:36:03,807 --> 00:36:05,240
May I stay now, sir?

610
00:36:06,007 --> 00:36:07,804
Go in the corner, out of my eyeline.

611
00:36:07,967 --> 00:36:09,559
Thank you, sir.

612
00:36:12,247 --> 00:36:14,886
- I can still see you.
- Yes, sir.

613
00:36:16,687 --> 00:36:20,760
What about the girl? What about this
Sally-Handy, Sally-Eagle wank-off?

614
00:36:20,927 --> 00:36:22,360
He'll have to cancel the date.

615
00:36:22,527 --> 00:36:24,643
Whoa, no, he can't cancel the date.

616
00:36:24,847 --> 00:36:27,805
You said it, Bert.
The Eagle doesn't back down.

617
00:36:28,447 --> 00:36:31,837
You clear up what I didn't know
and when I didn't know it, I'll be fine.

618
00:36:32,047 --> 00:36:34,242
- Should I draft a press release?
- Yeah.

619
00:36:34,447 --> 00:36:36,517
Oh! Oh, no. No.

620
00:36:38,047 --> 00:36:40,641
Call the press, have them over here
in the morning.

621
00:36:40,847 --> 00:36:43,725
And then get Handy Harrison
here to fix the toilet.

622
00:36:44,167 --> 00:36:46,317
You see where I'm going with this?

623
00:36:46,487 --> 00:36:48,523
I see it, Mr. President. I'm on it.

624
00:36:48,727 --> 00:36:50,365
Let's get to work.

625
00:36:53,767 --> 00:36:55,120
He's coming in.

626
00:36:56,447 --> 00:36:58,677
Let's go. Let's go. Move on through.

627
00:36:58,847 --> 00:37:02,157
- Oh, boy.
- Looks like an ambush.

628
00:37:03,007 --> 00:37:04,759
Oh, boy.

629
00:37:12,447 --> 00:37:14,358
Folks, I need a word with Mr. Harrison.

630
00:37:14,527 --> 00:37:16,358
- Morning, Handy.
- Morning, Mr. President.

631
00:37:16,527 --> 00:37:18,757
- You got toilet trouble, right?
- Yeah.

632
00:37:18,967 --> 00:37:22,243
Handy, I want to make it clear
that when I asked Miss Mannis out...

633
00:37:22,447 --> 00:37:25,120
...I had no idea that you two
had a relationship.

634
00:37:25,327 --> 00:37:29,161
And though I find it reprehensible for a
man to interfere in an ongoing romance...

635
00:37:29,407 --> 00:37:30,886
Me too.

636
00:37:31,047 --> 00:37:35,325
I also believe that a woman's heart
is hers and hers alone to give.

637
00:37:36,767 --> 00:37:38,200
Yeah. That's a good point.

638
00:37:38,887 --> 00:37:43,756
So I asked Sally out in ignorance
and she agreed to go.

639
00:37:44,287 --> 00:37:46,198
And until she tells me to stand down...

640
00:37:47,487 --> 00:37:49,717
...I intend to see her. Fair?

641
00:37:50,247 --> 00:37:51,726
Call him a horndog.

642
00:37:51,927 --> 00:37:53,406
Did she say "a horndog?"

643
00:37:53,607 --> 00:37:55,120
Well...

644
00:37:55,767 --> 00:37:59,806
...if it's okay with you, sir,
I'd like to chew on that a bit.

645
00:38:02,327 --> 00:38:04,795
Okay, you chew on that...

646
00:38:06,047 --> 00:38:11,075
...and if you find you can't swallow it,
I'll give you the Heimlich maneuver.

647
00:38:12,927 --> 00:38:14,280
Come and fix these toilets.

648
00:38:14,527 --> 00:38:18,918
- So are we going to see a date?
- I don't know what you'll see.

649
00:38:19,127 --> 00:38:20,845
Thank you so much. Thank you.

650
00:38:22,287 --> 00:38:25,484
- I feel great. Do we have any ice cream?
- Absolutely, sir.

651
00:38:25,647 --> 00:38:28,241
And I think we found a way to solve
your money problems.

652
00:38:28,367 --> 00:38:29,720
- Really?
- Yes.

653
00:38:38,047 --> 00:38:40,436
- Voil.
- That's it?

654
00:38:40,767 --> 00:38:44,965
Nothing to it. You save 3 million
dollars and look: Still beautiful.

655
00:38:45,167 --> 00:38:46,839
Excellent. Excellent.

656
00:38:47,047 --> 00:38:48,639
Don't even miss it.

657
00:38:51,167 --> 00:38:54,443
- Everybody, let's get back to work.
- Right away, sir.

658
00:38:55,687 --> 00:38:58,042
Son of a bitch.

659
00:39:00,487 --> 00:39:02,000
Sally!

660
00:39:07,327 --> 00:39:10,285
Plunger, you stay off of the couch.
Hello?

661
00:39:11,607 --> 00:39:14,440
Hey. Hey, it's me. What's up?

662
00:39:15,447 --> 00:39:18,439
What are you doing? Want to go do
something? See a movie?

663
00:39:18,607 --> 00:39:20,643
You know I have plans tonight.

664
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:23,801
That's right.
That's right.

665
00:39:23,967 --> 00:39:27,642
I forgot tonight's your date with
the president of the United States.

666
00:39:30,007 --> 00:39:31,645
You see this?

667
00:39:33,527 --> 00:39:36,724
"Local vet finds romance
with past president. "

668
00:39:37,127 --> 00:39:38,924
Where'd they get that picture?

669
00:39:39,487 --> 00:39:42,559
Well, there it is next to
the president on the front page.

670
00:39:42,767 --> 00:39:46,680
So, what about later? I mean, you know,
he must go to bed at 8:30. Right?

671
00:39:46,847 --> 00:39:50,123
So there's supposed to be a meteor
shower at 11:00. That could be cool.

672
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:51,686
It'll have to be another time.

673
00:39:53,407 --> 00:39:57,480
All right. It's not gonna happen for 240
years, but okay, I'll pencil that in.

674
00:39:57,727 --> 00:40:00,321
You gotta...
You gotta tighten these.

675
00:40:01,127 --> 00:40:05,166
If you're doing all this to get me
jealous, it's worked, okay?

676
00:40:05,407 --> 00:40:07,238
So could you stop it? Please?

677
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:09,358
Can you just cancel the date...

678
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:11,763
...with the president?

679
00:40:13,927 --> 00:40:16,999
So that's Wednesday. Then Thursday.

680
00:40:17,247 --> 00:40:19,078
Come in, come in, come in.

681
00:40:19,287 --> 00:40:20,561
Thank you, sir.

682
00:40:20,727 --> 00:40:24,845
Thursday I thought that you could
interview some of the ghostwriters.

683
00:40:25,007 --> 00:40:27,521
- Great, great, great.
- Where are you taking her?

684
00:40:27,887 --> 00:40:31,038
The Pig and the Whistle.
The only steakhouse in town.

685
00:40:31,247 --> 00:40:34,364
Supposed to be quiet, intimate.
Do you know it?

686
00:40:34,567 --> 00:40:36,444
Pig 'N' Whistle. No.

687
00:40:36,647 --> 00:40:39,241
What do I eat?
I mean, what do I talk about?

688
00:40:39,447 --> 00:40:41,324
Do I have anything in common with her?

689
00:40:41,567 --> 00:40:44,798
She's a veterinarian. Why don't you
talk about mad cow disease.

690
00:40:45,727 --> 00:40:48,560
- Don't, by the way, order meat.
- Why not?

691
00:40:48,727 --> 00:40:52,322
I'm guessing, but she may not appreciate
your wolfing down the animal...

692
00:40:52,487 --> 00:40:54,125
...she spent all day trying to save.

693
00:40:55,567 --> 00:40:56,841
Good point.

694
00:40:58,127 --> 00:40:59,480
Come on.

695
00:40:59,647 --> 00:41:02,115
Well, what?
Do you really actually like this guy?

696
00:41:02,687 --> 00:41:04,917
He wants to talk to me about dogs.

697
00:41:05,127 --> 00:41:08,483
- So why you all dressed up then?
- Because he's the president.

698
00:41:08,687 --> 00:41:12,475
Well, then why are you wearing
black underwear?

699
00:41:18,207 --> 00:41:19,845
Were you looking up my dress?

700
00:41:22,887 --> 00:41:24,559
Yeah, I was.

701
00:41:26,287 --> 00:41:28,084
Get over yourself.
I hardly touched you.

702
00:41:28,247 --> 00:41:32,479
How many times do I gotta tell you how
strong you are? You knuckled my bone.

703
00:41:34,367 --> 00:41:36,961
Listen, explain to me
the underwear choice, all right?

704
00:41:37,167 --> 00:41:41,763
I don't believe this. What difference does
it make what color my underwear is?

705
00:41:41,967 --> 00:41:44,765
It's an unconscious indicator...

706
00:41:44,967 --> 00:41:47,401
...of your subconscious intentions.

707
00:41:52,087 --> 00:41:53,486
How you feel about the pink?

708
00:41:54,047 --> 00:41:55,639
- No.
- No.

709
00:41:56,007 --> 00:41:57,918
- What about these?
- No.

710
00:41:58,367 --> 00:42:00,119
- These?
- All right...

711
00:42:00,327 --> 00:42:01,999
- Do you like any of these?
- I don't.

712
00:42:02,487 --> 00:42:04,318
We're going to Sears tomorrow.

713
00:42:05,407 --> 00:42:08,604
- Remember these?
- Yeah. That, we're locking up, okay?

714
00:42:09,407 --> 00:42:10,840
Or you know what?

715
00:42:11,007 --> 00:42:14,044
I could always go with none.
I wonder what that would indicate.

716
00:42:15,807 --> 00:42:18,526
Sally. Sally! Put some pants on!

717
00:42:20,927 --> 00:42:23,077
Hello? Handy's Hardware.

718
00:42:23,287 --> 00:42:24,561
Hello, Pig 'N' Whistle.

719
00:42:24,767 --> 00:42:26,280
<i>No, this is Handy's Hardware. </i>

720
00:42:26,527 --> 00:42:29,564
Good. I'd like to confirm
a reservation, please.

721
00:42:29,727 --> 00:42:32,321
- You have the wrong number.
<i>- Yes, I know. </i>

722
00:42:32,487 --> 00:42:34,603
For President Monroe Cole.

723
00:42:34,807 --> 00:42:37,480
<i>- Strictly confidential, of course. </i>
- Confidential?

724
00:42:37,687 --> 00:42:40,281
<i>Eight o 'clock. For two, yes?</i>

725
00:42:40,487 --> 00:42:42,603
Well, I'll be buggered by a bear.

726
00:42:42,807 --> 00:42:45,082
Yes, you will.
Look forward to seeing you there.

727
00:42:49,007 --> 00:42:50,998
This feels wrong and pushy.

728
00:42:51,167 --> 00:42:54,239
And him making her
his booty poodle isn't?

729
00:42:54,407 --> 00:42:57,001
You have to stop saying that. Please.

730
00:42:58,607 --> 00:43:00,837
Thank you. To new friends.

731
00:43:02,367 --> 00:43:05,245
- Lots of them.
- This way, Mr. President!

732
00:43:05,607 --> 00:43:07,006
Sorry about the gaggle.

733
00:43:07,207 --> 00:43:09,402
I just can't believe
they hound you like this.

734
00:43:09,607 --> 00:43:12,246
You get used to it.
They're kind of like pigeons.

735
00:43:12,407 --> 00:43:15,205
You throw them a crumb
once in a while and... Hello.

736
00:43:15,647 --> 00:43:18,115
- Thank you, sir.
- Hi, Mom.

737
00:43:18,447 --> 00:43:19,960
Out with the president.

738
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:25,041
That's great.

739
00:43:25,487 --> 00:43:26,761
Are we ready yet?

740
00:43:27,487 --> 00:43:30,718
I hope you're hungry.
I could eat a horse. Radish.

741
00:43:31,847 --> 00:43:33,565
Horseradish.

742
00:43:33,727 --> 00:43:35,638
- Sally?
- I'm not sure yet.

743
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:37,286
You go first, Mr. President.

744
00:43:37,487 --> 00:43:40,923
- Monroe, please.
- Monroe.

745
00:43:41,207 --> 00:43:42,686
So much to choose from here.

746
00:43:44,807 --> 00:43:46,081
I'll have the baked potato.

747
00:43:46,287 --> 00:43:48,278
- All right.
- Sour cream and butter...

748
00:43:48,447 --> 00:43:50,199
...and Baco Bits. Vegetarian...

749
00:43:51,247 --> 00:43:52,521
...Baco Bits.

750
00:43:52,687 --> 00:43:56,362
I'll have the endive salad
and a T-bone.

751
00:43:58,047 --> 00:44:00,277
- Sometimes you just want a steak, right?
- Yeah.

752
00:44:01,927 --> 00:44:03,724
No turning back. Get in there.

753
00:44:03,887 --> 00:44:05,843
- Harrison. Hold on a minute.
- What's wrong?

754
00:44:06,007 --> 00:44:07,486
Why can't we go in?

755
00:44:08,487 --> 00:44:09,761
- All right.
- Go on.

756
00:44:09,927 --> 00:44:11,724
- Okay. All right.
- What's going on?

757
00:44:12,687 --> 00:44:14,200
Hi.

758
00:44:14,367 --> 00:44:17,245
Sorry, everybody.
Sorry to interrupt. I was just...

759
00:44:17,447 --> 00:44:20,166
I want to let everybody know
that I'll be running for mayor.

760
00:44:20,327 --> 00:44:24,957
And I'd appreciate your votes. So I'll
hand these out and get out of your way.

761
00:44:25,127 --> 00:44:27,118
- Here you go.
- I'm voting for the president.

762
00:44:28,127 --> 00:44:31,403
Hi. Well, good evening, folks.
It's a nice night, isn't it?

763
00:44:31,647 --> 00:44:34,923
Running for mayor. Hey, you got yours?
Hi. Hi, Shelly.

764
00:44:36,247 --> 00:44:38,283
Want to remind people
I'm running for mayor.

765
00:44:38,647 --> 00:44:40,365
Yeah, we heard you before.

766
00:44:40,567 --> 00:44:43,957
Instead of interrupting our dinner,
why don't you two have a debate?

767
00:44:44,127 --> 00:44:47,005
- Debate?
- Yeah. Have a debate.

768
00:44:47,207 --> 00:44:49,880
No, I'm not going to bother
the president with that.

769
00:44:50,087 --> 00:44:52,601
Oh, no, no, a debate's fine by me.

770
00:44:52,807 --> 00:44:55,162
- There, you see?
- Now?

771
00:44:55,327 --> 00:44:58,444
Well, now is not the time
or place, Handy.

772
00:44:59,247 --> 00:45:00,965
But let's say the town hall...

773
00:45:01,127 --> 00:45:02,924
...Tuesday night.
- That's a great idea.

774
00:45:03,327 --> 00:45:06,444
- All right, well, I'll think about it.
- Of course he will.

775
00:45:06,647 --> 00:45:08,046
Tuesday, town hall. Great.

776
00:45:08,487 --> 00:45:10,398
Okay. All right. You're on.

777
00:45:10,567 --> 00:45:13,764
Okay, why don't we let everybody
get back to their dinner.

778
00:45:14,847 --> 00:45:16,758
All right. I'm gonna go in the bar.

779
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:19,999
Maybe there's people that are drunk
enough to vote for me in there.

780
00:45:21,127 --> 00:45:22,845
Good idea.

781
00:45:25,807 --> 00:45:28,480
- What are you mentioning a debate?
- You'll be fine.

782
00:45:28,687 --> 00:45:31,360
- I can't even talk to you.
- You'll be fine. Oh, come on.

783
00:45:31,567 --> 00:45:33,637
- I'm gonna stay. You go.
- Hand these out.

784
00:45:33,887 --> 00:45:37,562
Take the truck home, all right?
Put some gas in it.

785
00:45:38,047 --> 00:45:40,641
Hi, everybody. Sorry to interrupt.

786
00:45:44,487 --> 00:45:46,796
- Everything all right?
- Yes.

787
00:45:47,967 --> 00:45:49,719
Would you excuse me for one minute?

788
00:45:49,887 --> 00:45:51,639
- Yeah, certainly.
- Don't get up.

789
00:45:59,487 --> 00:46:02,763
Handy, get the hell out of here.

790
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:04,838
Sally, I have the right to campaign.

791
00:46:05,047 --> 00:46:07,800
Campaign?
You're making a fool of yourself.

792
00:46:08,767 --> 00:46:10,917
Well, welcome to politics.

793
00:46:12,607 --> 00:46:13,881
Discreetly. Discreetly.

794
00:46:17,967 --> 00:46:19,685
What's in it?

795
00:46:20,007 --> 00:46:21,326
They're...

796
00:46:21,687 --> 00:46:23,518
- It's beyond me, sir.
- What?

797
00:46:23,727 --> 00:46:25,240
- Should I get it to the FBI?
- Yes.

798
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:27,602
No. No, no. Here she comes.

799
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:30,359
Mr. President!

800
00:46:30,527 --> 00:46:32,040
Watch your step, Mr. President.

801
00:46:32,287 --> 00:46:36,599
- It's going well, don't you think?
- Mr. President, sir, I've been thinking.

802
00:46:36,807 --> 00:46:38,843
- I suggest a handshake, sir.
- What?

803
00:46:39,007 --> 00:46:40,963
It's a first date. I think a handshake...

804
00:46:41,167 --> 00:46:45,479
Grace, Grace. I'm doing great here.
I think you're underestimating me.

805
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:48,597
Mr. President, are you gonna
see her again?

806
00:46:50,687 --> 00:46:53,076
- Thank you.
- Sally. Over here. How'd the date go?

807
00:46:53,607 --> 00:46:56,041
Have you officially dumped Handy,
Miss Mannis?

808
00:46:56,247 --> 00:46:58,203
Whoa! Was that a meteor?

809
00:46:58,367 --> 00:47:00,756
It's supposed to be a shower tonight.

810
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:03,639
Maybe it's a good omen.

811
00:47:05,567 --> 00:47:08,161
I just want to apologize again
for Handy.

812
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:11,564
I certainly did not tell him
where we were going tonight.

813
00:47:11,767 --> 00:47:13,564
I understand totally.

814
00:47:14,847 --> 00:47:17,441
Well, good night.

815
00:47:22,247 --> 00:47:23,600
I...

816
00:47:27,247 --> 00:47:29,886
- Yes!
- Just a handshake?

817
00:47:34,167 --> 00:47:35,839
A little rusty there, Mr. President?

818
00:47:37,167 --> 00:47:40,762
Mr. President, crash and burn, man!

819
00:47:43,647 --> 00:47:45,080
<i>Okay, here it is again. </i>

820
00:47:45,287 --> 00:47:48,962
<i>The president goes in for the kiss. </i>
<i>Out comes her hand. </i>

821
00:47:49,167 --> 00:47:51,522
<i>And no thank you, Mr. President. </i>

822
00:47:51,967 --> 00:47:56,677
- Yeah! Let's get this guy another beer.
<i>- Here's Jaycee with some local opinion. </i>

823
00:47:56,887 --> 00:48:00,436
<i>- Here's some people. What do you think?</i>
- Oh, wait. Guys, guys, guys.

824
00:48:00,607 --> 00:48:02,996
<i>He was pushed. </i>
<i>He missed all her signals. </i>

825
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:04,760
<i>And you, sir?</i>

826
00:48:04,967 --> 00:48:07,561
<i>The president? Loser. </i>

827
00:48:07,727 --> 00:48:11,242
- That's me!
<i>- Quite a mixed bag of reaction. </i>

828
00:48:11,447 --> 00:48:12,960
<i>The president got vetoed. </i>

829
00:48:13,167 --> 00:48:14,520
<i>Can you believe it?</i>

830
00:48:14,727 --> 00:48:16,922
<i>Definitely the "Cole" shoulder. </i>

831
00:48:17,447 --> 00:48:19,597
- Cole shoulder.
<i>- The president lost that one. </i>

832
00:48:20,087 --> 00:48:22,282
<i>Do I hear lame duck?</i>

833
00:48:22,567 --> 00:48:24,922
Turn it off. All right? Just turn it off!

834
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:27,840
- Come on, turn it off. Turn it off.
- Here, Mr. President.

835
00:48:28,047 --> 00:48:29,400
There. It's off.

836
00:48:30,287 --> 00:48:31,800
Well, how do we fix this?

837
00:48:31,967 --> 00:48:35,357
We don't. We concentrate on substance.
We get rid of this debate.

838
00:48:35,567 --> 00:48:36,886
What's wrong with a debate?

839
00:48:37,047 --> 00:48:40,039
Putting him on the stage with you
gives him credibility, Eagle.

840
00:48:40,287 --> 00:48:43,006
And he can be funny, sir.
Funny is your weakness.

841
00:48:46,127 --> 00:48:47,799
Not weakness.

842
00:48:48,447 --> 00:48:50,563
Lesser strength.

843
00:48:50,767 --> 00:48:52,439
Oh, get out.

844
00:48:54,687 --> 00:48:57,326
- Out of your eyeline? Or the room...
- Just get out! Out!

845
00:48:58,367 --> 00:49:00,198
Dyer, Cloud, break his leg.

846
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:02,519
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

847
00:49:03,847 --> 00:49:05,599
They know I'm kidding, don't they?

848
00:49:06,807 --> 00:49:09,605
I'm kidding! I'm just kidding!

849
00:49:09,967 --> 00:49:13,243
<i>She didn't kiss the president</i>
<i>of the United States. </i>

850
00:49:13,407 --> 00:49:16,922
Sally! Sally! Sal!

851
00:49:17,967 --> 00:49:20,037
I'm coming. Stay there.

852
00:49:20,287 --> 00:49:22,642
Froggy. Green boy.

853
00:49:37,167 --> 00:49:38,441
Sally!

854
00:49:38,687 --> 00:49:40,917
Sally! Come on!

855
00:49:41,407 --> 00:49:43,204
The frog is empty.

856
00:49:44,927 --> 00:49:46,963
There's nothing in it...

857
00:49:47,647 --> 00:49:48,966
...except frog.

858
00:49:59,527 --> 00:50:01,916
Got a rock particle in my eye now.

859
00:50:02,127 --> 00:50:05,244
My eye hurts. I need a hug.

860
00:50:06,047 --> 00:50:07,685
Sally, just...

861
00:50:09,247 --> 00:50:11,317
For a little bit, we're gonna talk.

862
00:50:16,967 --> 00:50:20,596
This was a joke.
It was a bad joke.

863
00:50:22,887 --> 00:50:25,401
It's a little bit funny.

864
00:50:26,207 --> 00:50:28,596
Go to sleep, and maybe...

865
00:50:28,767 --> 00:50:31,201
Maybe we'll meet in our dreams.

866
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:36,483
Like you can connect a Nintendo
from one player to the next player.

867
00:50:38,847 --> 00:50:41,315
I'm blowing you a kiss.
It's by the window.

868
00:50:41,567 --> 00:50:44,286
And you... Tomorrow, get it,
when you wake up.

869
00:50:44,447 --> 00:50:47,086
You brush your teeth
and then you go get it.

870
00:50:48,927 --> 00:50:51,521
All right. I'm going home.

871
00:50:51,687 --> 00:50:53,518
I hurt my eye.

872
00:50:55,647 --> 00:50:58,525
Home. Feed my doggie.

873
00:51:08,287 --> 00:51:10,118
Testing. Can y'all hear me?

874
00:51:10,367 --> 00:51:12,597
- Sally!
- Hey, Dina.

875
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:20,805
Would you stop sweating.

876
00:51:21,007 --> 00:51:23,316
It goes with hyperventilating.

877
00:51:26,687 --> 00:51:30,839
We're all set, Eagle. You'll be stage
right, showing your best side.

878
00:51:31,047 --> 00:51:33,641
Talking points, issue cheat sheets.

879
00:51:33,847 --> 00:51:36,520
Wherever possible, tell them
about your experience.

880
00:51:36,767 --> 00:51:39,964
Demonstrate all the resources
that you can bring to Mooseport.

881
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:44,840
I'm not afraid of you.

882
00:51:47,607 --> 00:51:49,723
- I can't feel my feet.
- Your feet are fine.

883
00:51:49,927 --> 00:51:52,600
- I can't feel them.
- Don't be a weenie. Now, shape up.

884
00:51:52,967 --> 00:51:54,844
- Is my hair sticking up?
- Turn around.

885
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:56,599
Put it down already.

886
00:51:56,767 --> 00:51:58,917
- There you go.
- Shut your eyes, baby.

887
00:51:59,167 --> 00:52:00,998
Stop it! Stop it!

888
00:52:01,727 --> 00:52:05,640
Look at it, Handy. Motels are full.
Stores are packed.

889
00:52:05,887 --> 00:52:09,721
Do you realize that this is Mooseport's
first traffic jam since... Ever!

890
00:52:09,927 --> 00:52:11,645
We gotta have a second debate.

891
00:52:11,847 --> 00:52:13,565
- No!
- Mr. President! Hey, y'all!

892
00:52:13,727 --> 00:52:15,683
My nose is making a whistling noise.

893
00:52:33,967 --> 00:52:35,480
Sorry.

894
00:52:36,887 --> 00:52:38,764
My fellow Americans...

895
00:52:38,967 --> 00:52:42,755
...welcome to the first of two televised
mayoral debates.

896
00:52:42,927 --> 00:52:45,157
In the grand old Mooseport tradition...

897
00:52:45,367 --> 00:52:47,164
...a game of Rock Paper Scissors...

898
00:52:47,367 --> 00:52:50,086
...will determine who'll answer
questions first. Gentlemen.

899
00:52:50,247 --> 00:52:52,044
- There you go.
- Show them how it's done.

900
00:52:52,207 --> 00:52:53,640
Handy. Mr. President.

901
00:52:53,807 --> 00:52:55,320
Eagle!

902
00:52:55,487 --> 00:52:56,761
You know the rules.

903
00:52:57,647 --> 00:53:01,162
Rock. Paper. Scissors. Okay?

904
00:53:01,327 --> 00:53:03,921
- On the count of three.
- Go get them, Eagle!

905
00:53:04,087 --> 00:53:06,442
One, two, three.

906
00:53:07,687 --> 00:53:10,042
Rock, rock. Tie. Go again.

907
00:53:11,367 --> 00:53:13,517
- Pick paper!
- I'd choose scissors!

908
00:53:14,767 --> 00:53:17,361
- Come on, focus.
- Good luck, Mr. President!

909
00:53:18,127 --> 00:53:19,765
One, two, three.

910
00:53:19,927 --> 00:53:21,485
Oh, paper, paper. Tie. Go again.

911
00:53:24,487 --> 00:53:25,840
Rock!

912
00:53:36,367 --> 00:53:38,005
Come on, focus!

913
00:53:38,607 --> 00:53:41,201
One, two, three.

914
00:53:42,727 --> 00:53:44,638
Oh, come on!

915
00:53:45,007 --> 00:53:48,556
Rock breaks scissors.
The president wins!

916
00:53:52,447 --> 00:53:55,200
I am now prepared to entertain
questions from the floor.

917
00:53:55,367 --> 00:53:56,641
- I got one!
- Clay?

918
00:53:58,727 --> 00:54:00,843
Some of them environment people...

919
00:54:01,007 --> 00:54:05,319
...have taken to calling
Ned Barker's pond a wetlands.

920
00:54:05,487 --> 00:54:09,480
Now, I've been fishing there for
30 years. What's gonna happen?

921
00:54:09,647 --> 00:54:11,558
- What's gonna happen?
- Good question.

922
00:54:12,687 --> 00:54:16,566
Clay, I was the most environmentally
conscious president...

923
00:54:16,767 --> 00:54:18,041
...since Teddy Roosevelt.

924
00:54:18,247 --> 00:54:24,356
Human population won't threaten wildlife
in this area for 200 years, if ever.

925
00:54:24,527 --> 00:54:26,518
So go right on fishing in that pond...

926
00:54:26,687 --> 00:54:29,804
...and if anybody tries to stop you,
you send them to me, all right?

927
00:54:31,647 --> 00:54:34,286
Right on, Mr. President!

928
00:54:36,007 --> 00:54:37,679
Handy.

929
00:54:40,887 --> 00:54:42,605
Come on, Handy. Come on.

930
00:54:46,287 --> 00:54:48,084
That's well-put, Mr. President.

931
00:54:51,127 --> 00:54:52,924
It sounds good to me.

932
00:55:00,207 --> 00:55:01,765
Handy, come on.

933
00:55:02,767 --> 00:55:04,041
My turn! My turn!

934
00:55:04,207 --> 00:55:06,596
- Morris! Over here!
- Francis?

935
00:55:07,727 --> 00:55:12,596
For 10 years now, we have needed a
stop sign front of Lucy Decker's house.

936
00:55:12,847 --> 00:55:17,477
And she has done everything except
burn down city hall to stop it.

937
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:20,684
If elected, what will you do about it?

938
00:55:21,967 --> 00:55:25,846
First off, I would convene a commission
to study the problem.

939
00:55:26,047 --> 00:55:29,596
I would appoint a blue-ribbon panel
of traffic specialists...

940
00:55:29,767 --> 00:55:33,203
...right-of-way attorneys,
and the Army Corps of Engineers...

941
00:55:33,407 --> 00:55:36,524
...to assess the situation
and make recommendations.

942
00:55:36,727 --> 00:55:41,084
I would spare no effort to make
our streets the safest in the world.

943
00:55:44,727 --> 00:55:45,955
Get him, Eagle!

944
00:55:47,007 --> 00:55:50,204
- Handy, your turn.
- Gotta go for it!

945
00:55:51,727 --> 00:55:53,797
That's well-put, Mr. President.

946
00:56:01,007 --> 00:56:02,998
Lucy, let me ask you,
what's the problem?

947
00:56:03,207 --> 00:56:04,845
Car headlights.

948
00:56:05,047 --> 00:56:09,199
Ten years ago they tried a stop sign,
and when cars on Bay Street stopped...

949
00:56:09,407 --> 00:56:11,875
...their headlights stopped right
on my headboard.

950
00:56:13,447 --> 00:56:16,120
- Have you tried curtains?
- Excuse me?

951
00:56:16,327 --> 00:56:19,160
You know, blackout curtains
for your windows.

952
00:56:19,367 --> 00:56:21,483
You'd probably sleep better anyway.

953
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:25,166
Well, I'd try that.
Nobody ever suggested that.

954
00:56:25,327 --> 00:56:28,205
Well, you come by the store
and we'll help you out.

955
00:56:29,487 --> 00:56:33,799
- I'll do that.
- That's it, Handy. You tell them!

956
00:56:40,487 --> 00:56:43,240
- Dad! Dad!
- Mandy Gutman.

957
00:56:43,927 --> 00:56:46,680
Dad, this is a question for Handy.
Is that okay?

958
00:56:46,887 --> 00:56:48,843
If the president has no objection.

959
00:56:49,007 --> 00:56:51,441
I reserve the right to respond,
but no objection.

960
00:56:51,807 --> 00:56:53,445
Okay, Mandy.

961
00:56:54,127 --> 00:56:58,598
Handy, I was just wondering,
now that Sally is dating the president...

962
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:04,516
...does that mean that
you're available?

963
00:57:05,007 --> 00:57:08,682
People, can we keep the questioning
to the subject of the election?

964
00:57:08,887 --> 00:57:10,605
I think Joe had a question...

965
00:57:10,887 --> 00:57:13,879
Actually, Morris, I'd like to address
the issue, if I might.

966
00:57:14,087 --> 00:57:16,282
Thank you.
Thanks, Mandy, for that question.

967
00:57:17,447 --> 00:57:19,039
Sally...

968
00:57:19,567 --> 00:57:22,684
...I know I might not be
the best boyfriend, but...

969
00:57:24,047 --> 00:57:26,163
Look, I thought we had
a good thing going here.

970
00:57:27,647 --> 00:57:30,241
You gotta know how much
I care about you, right?

971
00:57:32,487 --> 00:57:35,285
Why do you think I got mad about
the underwear and the president?

972
00:57:35,447 --> 00:57:37,961
- Tell us about the underwear!
- Was it a thong?

973
00:57:38,607 --> 00:57:42,600
No, no, no. It's just...
It's color. It's a color thing.

974
00:57:44,167 --> 00:57:47,637
Sally, what's the deal?
Are you going out with him or me?

975
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:51,316
Go for the Eagle!

976
00:57:51,527 --> 00:57:53,722
Sally, pick the president!

977
00:57:54,087 --> 00:57:56,885
<i>- Eagle! Eagle! Eagle!</i>
- Stop it!

978
00:57:57,487 --> 00:57:58,761
Stop it!

979
00:57:59,967 --> 00:58:02,561
Come on, Sally, choose Handy!

980
00:58:02,767 --> 00:58:04,041
Which one's it gonna be?

981
00:58:06,767 --> 00:58:08,280
Sally.

982
00:58:11,407 --> 00:58:13,284
Excuse me. Excuse me.

983
00:58:18,207 --> 00:58:20,926
Sally. Sally!

984
00:58:21,527 --> 00:58:22,926
- Sally.
- Are you crazy?

985
00:58:23,087 --> 00:58:26,443
- You didn't answer the phone.
- I can't believe you did that.

986
00:58:26,647 --> 00:58:28,080
What I said means nothing?

987
00:58:28,287 --> 00:58:30,881
You mentioned my underwear
in front of the whole town.

988
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:33,157
The whole country.
That's how much I care.

989
00:58:33,327 --> 00:58:35,557
- You didn't answer the question.
- What question?

990
00:58:35,727 --> 00:58:37,001
Is it me or him?

991
00:58:37,167 --> 00:58:41,365
Is it me or your new truck? Don't try
to make this about me. It's about you.

992
00:58:41,567 --> 00:58:43,956
How? How is that about me? How...?

993
00:58:47,687 --> 00:58:49,484
Man, she pushed you right down.

994
00:58:49,687 --> 00:58:51,757
Yeah, she's stronger than me.

995
00:58:52,447 --> 00:58:56,201
<i>- It's not about me, it's about you. </i>
<i>- How? How is it about me?</i>

996
00:58:57,647 --> 00:58:59,399
<i>Well, you heard it here first. </i>

997
00:58:59,567 --> 00:59:03,321
<i>It looks like Sally is going to cast</i>
<i>her ballot in favor of the president. </i>

998
00:59:03,567 --> 00:59:06,445
<i>I'm Christy Adams, TVNN News. </i>

999
00:59:06,847 --> 00:59:08,917
Yeah, baby, you're going down.

1000
00:59:09,487 --> 00:59:12,718
So, what do you think?
Should I set up another date, or what?

1001
00:59:12,927 --> 00:59:14,918
- Why not?
- Excuse me.

1002
00:59:15,407 --> 00:59:16,920
Grace?

1003
00:59:17,967 --> 00:59:20,765
- Well, what's her problem?
- Maybe she saw the numbers.

1004
00:59:22,127 --> 00:59:25,278
You may have done well with the girl,
but the debate was a disaster.

1005
00:59:25,447 --> 00:59:27,199
What're you talking about?
Lmpossible.

1006
00:59:27,367 --> 00:59:30,279
It's a small town, Eagle.
The rules are different here.

1007
00:59:32,407 --> 00:59:35,080
Well, you guys are the hotshots.
Brainstorm.

1008
00:59:36,647 --> 00:59:38,126
Well?

1009
00:59:39,247 --> 00:59:40,919
Sir...

1010
00:59:41,087 --> 00:59:42,998
- Excuse me, Mr. President?
- Yes?

1011
00:59:43,407 --> 00:59:46,205
- We could eliminate him.
- What?

1012
00:59:46,727 --> 00:59:50,515
You wanna make it look like an accident,
but maybe his brakes could go out.

1013
00:59:50,887 --> 00:59:53,481
- Oh, my God.
- Or he could slip on a oil slick.

1014
00:59:53,647 --> 00:59:55,558
What, are you insane?

1015
00:59:55,767 --> 00:59:58,725
No, sir. I was...
I was just brainstorming.

1016
01:00:00,527 --> 01:00:02,279
Did I misunderstand the question?

1017
01:00:02,447 --> 01:00:04,358
Thank God you guys are on our side.

1018
01:00:04,527 --> 01:00:06,006
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

1019
01:00:13,047 --> 01:00:14,719
Hello.

1020
01:00:15,527 --> 01:00:18,758
Small town politics. Oh, boy.

1021
01:00:26,927 --> 01:00:29,157
- I like three sugars.
- You only need one.

1022
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:31,876
- I like three.
- Three's unhealthy.

1023
01:00:32,447 --> 01:00:34,199
- What's eating you?
- Eating me?

1024
01:00:34,407 --> 01:00:35,886
Yes. Somehow you seem irked.

1025
01:00:36,087 --> 01:00:38,840
- Irked? Really?
- Irked. Really.

1026
01:00:39,047 --> 01:00:41,800
Well, actually I am a little irked,
now that you mention it.

1027
01:00:43,607 --> 01:00:45,757
- Would you like to know why?
- Absolutely.

1028
01:00:45,927 --> 01:00:49,920
Sit down there, Grace,
and just tell me all about it, okay?

1029
01:00:51,607 --> 01:00:53,199
Well...

1030
01:00:53,567 --> 01:00:57,082
...when you...
When we first came to live here, I...

1031
01:00:57,327 --> 01:01:00,239
- Excuse me, Mr. President.
- Could we have a minute here, please?

1032
01:01:00,407 --> 01:01:02,682
Sorry, Eagle, we have an emergency.

1033
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:04,838
Unless somebody's dying,
I don't wanna hear.

1034
01:01:05,047 --> 01:01:08,084
It's Charlotte. She's coming here.

1035
01:01:08,447 --> 01:01:10,802
Howdy. Handy for mayor.

1036
01:01:11,247 --> 01:01:14,125
- Vote for Handy. That's right.
- Go to court.

1037
01:01:14,287 --> 01:01:17,006
Get a restraining order.
We got to do something about this.

1038
01:01:17,167 --> 01:01:18,441
The sure way, sir...

1039
01:01:18,607 --> 01:01:20,882
Dyer, this is too smart for her.

1040
01:01:21,047 --> 01:01:24,403
Who thought of this?
It was him, wasn't it? Yeah.

1041
01:01:24,567 --> 01:01:26,922
- Grace, I'll handle this.
- Yes, sir.

1042
01:01:28,887 --> 01:01:30,684
Vote for Handy.

1043
01:01:30,887 --> 01:01:32,366
I had dignity once.

1044
01:01:33,367 --> 01:01:35,483
Does anybody remember that?

1045
01:01:44,047 --> 01:01:45,719
Did Handy put you up to this?

1046
01:01:46,327 --> 01:01:48,921
Hello, Monroe. What brought you here?

1047
01:01:49,087 --> 01:01:51,555
Charlotte, hon, could we talk
in private, please?

1048
01:01:51,727 --> 01:01:54,195
This is as private as I got for 20 years.
What is it?

1049
01:01:54,407 --> 01:01:56,363
Sweetie, if we could just talk alone.

1050
01:01:56,527 --> 01:01:58,597
- Handy for mayor.
- We can work something out.

1051
01:01:58,767 --> 01:02:01,440
Honeybunch, can we go inside, please?

1052
01:02:02,047 --> 01:02:05,403
- Fine.
- Why do you think she's here, sir?

1053
01:02:06,327 --> 01:02:07,726
That ought to do it.

1054
01:02:07,927 --> 01:02:10,760
President's coming.
Better hide the payroll benefits.

1055
01:02:11,367 --> 01:02:14,325
- Charlotte, step into my office.
- Yes, dear.

1056
01:02:18,007 --> 01:02:21,795
Married couples have a shorthand,
Monroe. Ours is 9 million dollars.

1057
01:02:22,007 --> 01:02:24,521
- Nine? I don't have it!
- Twenty-five years.

1058
01:02:24,727 --> 01:02:28,197
A quarter of a century I endured,
and now you're pleading poverty?

1059
01:02:28,367 --> 01:02:31,404
You took the house, the boat.
You took everything but my title!

1060
01:02:32,127 --> 01:02:34,800
Hello, this is former
first lady Charlotte Cole.

1061
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:39,876
I spent 25 years with Monroe Cole,
which is why I'm supporting Harrison.

1062
01:02:40,047 --> 01:02:43,278
Yes, you heard me.
I'm supporting Handy Harrison.

1063
01:02:43,727 --> 01:02:45,285
Eagle?

1064
01:02:50,087 --> 01:02:52,123
Have I gotten through
to you, lambkins?

1065
01:02:54,287 --> 01:02:56,755
I never thought you'd stoop
this low, Harrison.

1066
01:02:57,287 --> 01:03:00,006
I thought this was a fair fight
between two honorable men...

1067
01:03:00,167 --> 01:03:03,239
...but I see I'm up against somebody
who doesn't play by the rules.

1068
01:03:03,567 --> 01:03:06,001
- Have you no sense of decency?
- I'm sorry.

1069
01:03:06,167 --> 01:03:09,045
Talk about hitting below the belt.
Bringing in a man's ex-wife.

1070
01:03:09,247 --> 01:03:12,125
You're showing your true colors,
aren't you?

1071
01:03:13,967 --> 01:03:16,003
I had nothing to do with it!

1072
01:03:16,767 --> 01:03:19,759
- Watch your back.
- That's it. I've had it.

1073
01:03:20,207 --> 01:03:22,926
I want them both. I want you
to think about a way to do it.

1074
01:03:23,087 --> 01:03:24,600
- Coming through.
- Sir.

1075
01:03:24,767 --> 01:03:26,803
- Is he...? Is he serious?
- No! No! No!

1076
01:03:26,967 --> 01:03:28,764
Mr. President, you want a fair fight?

1077
01:03:29,447 --> 01:03:32,564
You just called me dishonorable, sir,
and I'm not.

1078
01:03:32,767 --> 01:03:34,997
So if it's a fair fight you want...

1079
01:03:35,727 --> 01:03:37,240
...just you and me...

1080
01:03:38,007 --> 01:03:39,599
...I think I know the place.

1081
01:03:46,927 --> 01:03:48,201
You're on.

1082
01:03:50,807 --> 01:03:52,559
What are we doing here, Harrison?

1083
01:03:52,927 --> 01:03:54,440
What are the stakes?

1084
01:03:54,607 --> 01:03:56,086
Mayor?

1085
01:03:56,287 --> 01:03:58,755
No, sir. Sally.

1086
01:03:59,647 --> 01:04:01,160
Loser backs off of Sally.

1087
01:04:01,607 --> 01:04:03,563
- We're both 10 handicaps, sir.
- Sir.

1088
01:04:04,047 --> 01:04:06,277
- Fair fight.
- You're on.

1089
01:04:06,487 --> 01:04:08,796
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Show me the way.

1090
01:04:09,327 --> 01:04:12,524
Sir, there's something I'd like to
discuss with you about your game...

1091
01:04:13,487 --> 01:04:15,000
Eyeline.

1092
01:04:18,607 --> 01:04:20,723
- Nice shot.
- Thank you.

1093
01:04:20,887 --> 01:04:23,003
- A little bit left.
- Right where I was aiming.

1094
01:04:23,247 --> 01:04:24,726
I might drive the green.

1095
01:04:31,447 --> 01:04:34,041
Hello! Wait for me!

1096
01:04:36,367 --> 01:04:41,077
- What are you doing here?
- Just making sure a fair fight's fair.

1097
01:04:41,287 --> 01:04:43,357
Call them out, Mr. Dyer.

1098
01:04:43,767 --> 01:04:45,200
I'm, uh, sorry, ma'am?

1099
01:04:51,687 --> 01:04:53,325
Cloud!

1100
01:04:53,487 --> 01:04:55,079
You and your men come on out!

1101
01:04:56,567 --> 01:04:57,886
Oh, shit.

1102
01:04:58,287 --> 01:05:00,881
Come on! I know you're there!

1103
01:05:04,127 --> 01:05:07,915
- All right, come on out.
- Everyone onto the fairway.

1104
01:05:13,927 --> 01:05:16,600
We're securing the perimeter,
Mrs. Cole!

1105
01:05:16,807 --> 01:05:19,480
Secure it from there, okay?

1106
01:05:19,727 --> 01:05:21,126
Yes, ma'am.

1107
01:05:22,927 --> 01:05:24,201
Stay in position.

1108
01:05:24,607 --> 01:05:27,246
Hit away, lambkins.

1109
01:05:38,127 --> 01:05:40,243
Wait! Wait! Wait for the bounce.

1110
01:05:44,847 --> 01:05:46,963
Damn. Take a mulligan.

1111
01:05:47,167 --> 01:05:49,840
We're playing for a woman, sir.
There's no mulligans.

1112
01:05:50,047 --> 01:05:52,720
Wha...? What do I do?

1113
01:05:52,887 --> 01:05:54,605
You've never hit a ball
out of bounds?

1114
01:05:54,767 --> 01:05:56,200
Not since I was governor.

1115
01:05:56,367 --> 01:05:59,723
You hit another one from here,
shooting three.

1116
01:05:59,887 --> 01:06:01,718
- Three?
- Three.

1117
01:06:02,327 --> 01:06:04,318
One, two...

1118
01:06:04,847 --> 01:06:06,644
...shooting three.

1119
01:06:10,287 --> 01:06:12,642
- Excuse me, Mr. President?
- What?

1120
01:06:13,007 --> 01:06:14,679
You can't beat him, sir.

1121
01:06:15,007 --> 01:06:17,237
What? We're the same handicap.

1122
01:06:17,487 --> 01:06:21,002
- Well, your handicap is augmented.
- What are you trying to say?

1123
01:06:21,487 --> 01:06:23,398
It was really Miss Sutherland's idea.

1124
01:06:23,607 --> 01:06:26,644
She had Dyer and Cloud
and occasionally me...

1125
01:06:26,847 --> 01:06:30,965
...we helped you with lucky bounces
and scorecard fudging.

1126
01:06:31,727 --> 01:06:33,604
And you can't beat him, sir.

1127
01:06:34,047 --> 01:06:35,844
Is there a problem?

1128
01:06:36,727 --> 01:06:38,126
No.

1129
01:06:41,367 --> 01:06:42,925
No problem.

1130
01:06:52,247 --> 01:06:55,523
- That one's in.
- Didn't quite get it on the green.

1131
01:06:57,167 --> 01:06:59,362
I'll take it.

1132
01:06:59,527 --> 01:07:01,279
You two have helped enough.

1133
01:07:08,527 --> 01:07:10,245
Hi, Peggy. Can I get a black coffee?

1134
01:07:10,407 --> 01:07:11,999
Sure.

1135
01:07:13,207 --> 01:07:15,243
- Hello.
- Hello.

1136
01:07:16,287 --> 01:07:18,755
- Here you are, dear.
- Thanks.

1137
01:07:20,767 --> 01:07:23,725
So I hear they're golfing for mayor.

1138
01:07:24,127 --> 01:07:25,606
Actually...

1139
01:07:25,847 --> 01:07:27,883
...they're golfing for you.

1140
01:07:28,367 --> 01:07:30,437
- No.
- Yeah.

1141
01:07:30,767 --> 01:07:32,120
No.

1142
01:07:33,927 --> 01:07:35,565
Could I make this an Irish coffee?

1143
01:07:36,047 --> 01:07:37,799
This okay?

1144
01:08:05,607 --> 01:08:08,440
Oh, that's five.

1145
01:08:14,087 --> 01:08:16,681
- That was a gimme.
- No, no, no. There are no gimmes.

1146
01:08:16,887 --> 01:08:18,366
It was inside the leather.

1147
01:08:18,567 --> 01:08:19,966
You gotta get it in the hole.

1148
01:08:26,927 --> 01:08:28,519
I'll take a seven.

1149
01:08:28,887 --> 01:08:30,764
Actually, it's 15.

1150
01:08:31,407 --> 01:08:35,002
- Fifteen? No way.
- Yes way.

1151
01:08:35,167 --> 01:08:37,681
- The president is right. It's seven.
- Yeah, it's seven.

1152
01:08:37,847 --> 01:08:40,122
Well, let's count them.
One, out of bounds.

1153
01:08:40,367 --> 01:08:41,846
<i>Two, back on the tee. </i>

1154
01:08:42,047 --> 01:08:43,719
<i>Three, in the rough. </i>

1155
01:08:43,887 --> 01:08:45,161
Four, in the sand.

1156
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:48,277
<i>Five, you missed completely. </i>

1157
01:08:49,807 --> 01:08:52,685
<i>Six, almost out of the sand,</i>
<i>but still in it. </i>

1158
01:08:54,287 --> 01:08:56,596
<i>Seven, finally, out of the sand... </i>

1159
01:08:56,847 --> 01:08:58,200
<i>... into that sand. </i>

1160
01:08:59,527 --> 01:09:01,040
Eight, out of the sand...

1161
01:09:01,247 --> 01:09:04,762
<i>... into the rough. That's when you</i>
<i>threw your club at the tree. </i>

1162
01:09:07,247 --> 01:09:09,317
<i>Nine, you almost hit me. </i>

1163
01:09:09,527 --> 01:09:11,563
<i>Ten, you did hit me. </i>

1164
01:09:14,967 --> 01:09:16,719
Eleven, on the green.

1165
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:19,236
Twelve, you putt to six feet
past the hole.

1166
01:09:19,407 --> 01:09:22,922
That's when you said that curse
that I've never heard before.

1167
01:09:23,087 --> 01:09:25,521
Thirteen, you putt to one foot
from the hole.

1168
01:09:25,727 --> 01:09:27,319
<i>Fourteen, you missed the putt. </i>

1169
01:09:27,527 --> 01:09:30,166
<i>You said, "That's a gimme. "</i>
<i>I said, "There are no gimmes. "</i>

1170
01:09:30,327 --> 01:09:33,080
Fifteen, in the hole.

1171
01:09:34,607 --> 01:09:35,960
Fifteen.

1172
01:09:37,087 --> 01:09:39,726
That was so close.

1173
01:09:40,007 --> 01:09:41,281
All right.

1174
01:09:41,447 --> 01:09:45,406
Now, through the sugars.

1175
01:09:45,647 --> 01:09:49,196
And then around the saucer...

1176
01:09:49,407 --> 01:09:52,365
...and through the ketchup tunnel.

1177
01:09:52,527 --> 01:09:55,485
And the winner gets Morris Gutman.

1178
01:09:55,687 --> 01:09:58,326
- Married.
- Oh, right. Kent.

1179
01:10:00,607 --> 01:10:03,326
Are you trying to get me
to throw the match?

1180
01:10:04,127 --> 01:10:05,446
Reuben.

1181
01:10:05,607 --> 01:10:06,960
- Who? Who's Reuben?
- Reuben.

1182
01:10:07,167 --> 01:10:09,203
"I said, 'Get the president! '"

1183
01:10:10,767 --> 01:10:14,919
That's a great idea.
The winner gets Reuben.

1184
01:10:15,167 --> 01:10:16,646
Ready?

1185
01:10:23,887 --> 01:10:26,242
- Oh, my God.
- That must mean a do over.

1186
01:10:27,407 --> 01:10:28,840
Okay, Handy.

1187
01:10:29,007 --> 01:10:31,043
You're up about a million strokes.

1188
01:10:31,247 --> 01:10:34,125
It's the last hole.
How about double or nothing?

1189
01:10:34,327 --> 01:10:36,238
What's double? What's nothing?

1190
01:10:36,447 --> 01:10:41,601
Well, nothing is we're even.
Tie. Status quo.

1191
01:10:42,127 --> 01:10:45,676
Double would be I back off Sally,
drop out of the mayor's race.

1192
01:10:46,687 --> 01:10:49,997
You got it. Okay. Go ahead. You hit.

1193
01:10:50,207 --> 01:10:51,765
But, you know...

1194
01:10:52,127 --> 01:10:55,119
...if I'm going to risk all that...

1195
01:10:56,487 --> 01:10:59,081
...you got to give me something.
You got to...

1196
01:10:59,247 --> 01:11:02,205
- Oh, I don't know...
- What?

1197
01:11:02,847 --> 01:11:05,645
- One throw.
- Throw?

1198
01:11:05,807 --> 01:11:08,924
Yeah, I get one throw because
I can't play you even.

1199
01:11:09,127 --> 01:11:11,322
You got local knowledge here.
You're killing me.

1200
01:11:11,487 --> 01:11:14,160
He can't throw either. Bury him.

1201
01:11:15,687 --> 01:11:21,159
Okay. You get one throw,
but if we tie, I win.

1202
01:11:21,327 --> 01:11:24,956
Well, you drive a hard bargain,
but okay.

1203
01:11:34,927 --> 01:11:36,485
Yeah, baby.

1204
01:11:37,047 --> 01:11:39,117
There's the old form back.

1205
01:11:51,967 --> 01:11:53,286
What?

1206
01:11:53,607 --> 01:11:55,484
Hey, what are you doing?

1207
01:11:55,927 --> 01:11:58,282
Hey! What's that?

1208
01:11:59,847 --> 01:12:02,236
I said one throw.
I didn't say whose ball.

1209
01:12:05,527 --> 01:12:07,119
You're out of bounds.

1210
01:12:07,287 --> 01:12:09,164
Click, click, click.

1211
01:12:13,487 --> 01:12:15,125
Morning, sir. Everything all right?

1212
01:12:15,327 --> 01:12:19,718
Oh, just dandy.
I'm a 10 handicap and I shot a 142.

1213
01:12:19,927 --> 01:12:23,397
We have to have a serious talk
about my handicap, Miss Sutherland.

1214
01:12:23,607 --> 01:12:27,077
- Now, Mr. President?
- Later.

1215
01:12:27,247 --> 01:12:29,966
I heard you broke even.
At least you didn't lose.

1216
01:12:30,167 --> 01:12:32,283
The most humiliating round of my life.

1217
01:12:32,487 --> 01:12:35,126
Time to take the gloves off, Bert.
Let's bury this guy.

1218
01:12:35,287 --> 01:12:37,323
Well, sir, he's clean as a whistle.

1219
01:12:37,487 --> 01:12:42,003
Oh, come on. Surely he did something.
Knocked up a local? Grew marijuana?

1220
01:12:42,207 --> 01:12:44,084
Hell, I grew marijuana.

1221
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:47,723
We'll find dirt, Eagle,
even if we have to make it up.

1222
01:12:47,927 --> 01:12:50,521
- Exactly.
- I don't believe this.

1223
01:12:50,887 --> 01:12:52,400
What?

1224
01:12:53,807 --> 01:12:55,638
Mr. President...

1225
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:58,037
...I'm giving my notice.
- Your notice?

1226
01:12:58,247 --> 01:13:00,442
Yes, I can't work here any longer.

1227
01:13:00,687 --> 01:13:04,043
Are you drunk, for God's sakes?
We've been together 15 years.

1228
01:13:04,247 --> 01:13:08,843
Yes, exactly. And in all that time,
you have never once gone negative...

1229
01:13:09,007 --> 01:13:10,645
...at least not first.

1230
01:13:10,847 --> 01:13:15,318
And you have never, ever stooped
to threats or harassment.

1231
01:13:15,527 --> 01:13:18,405
Grace, he brought in Charlotte.
Charlotte.

1232
01:13:18,567 --> 01:13:20,239
If that's not harassment, what is?

1233
01:13:20,447 --> 01:13:26,363
Mr. President, you have two days,
two hours and 21 minutes...

1234
01:13:26,567 --> 01:13:28,364
...until this election is over...

1235
01:13:28,567 --> 01:13:31,206
...and then I'm gone.

1236
01:13:34,887 --> 01:13:36,206
What's that?

1237
01:13:36,687 --> 01:13:39,281
- I think she quit, sir.
- Not that. That.

1238
01:13:40,527 --> 01:13:42,165
Oh, this? It's the new poll.

1239
01:13:42,367 --> 01:13:44,198
- Five points.
- Five?

1240
01:13:44,847 --> 01:13:47,077
- Down.
- What's the sample size?

1241
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:50,039
Come on, Bert, what's the sample size?

1242
01:13:51,407 --> 01:13:55,161
- Everybody.
- Everybody? This is a disaster!

1243
01:13:55,327 --> 01:13:57,966
Not to pile on, but I'm worried
about the book deals too.

1244
01:13:58,127 --> 01:14:01,278
Crap! It's like some
mythic Greek puzzle.

1245
01:14:01,487 --> 01:14:04,763
The riddle of the handyman.
Somewhere, the answer.

1246
01:14:04,967 --> 01:14:06,764
Sir, let's not panic. This isn't over.

1247
01:14:06,967 --> 01:14:08,685
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1248
01:14:08,967 --> 01:14:11,322
- What's wrong with us?
- What?

1249
01:14:11,527 --> 01:14:13,677
I'll give it to him. It's that simple.

1250
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:15,479
Wait, you don't mean quit.

1251
01:14:15,687 --> 01:14:17,166
You can't quit, Eagle.

1252
01:14:17,327 --> 01:14:19,238
I wouldn't quit.
That's the beauty of it.

1253
01:14:19,447 --> 01:14:22,757
I'll say how qualified he is.
How he's the best man for the job.

1254
01:14:22,927 --> 01:14:25,805
And tonight at the debate,
I'll throw him my support.

1255
01:14:25,967 --> 01:14:27,559
If I win, I win. But if I lose...

1256
01:14:27,727 --> 01:14:31,766
...it's because I made the most
magnanimous gesture in political history.

1257
01:14:31,967 --> 01:14:34,242
And people took my advice.

1258
01:14:34,927 --> 01:14:37,316
- It's brilliant, sir.
- Thank you.

1259
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:40,357
And then I'd get the girl...

1260
01:14:41,087 --> 01:14:44,079
- Sally.
- Sally. Right.

1261
01:14:49,647 --> 01:14:52,366
Sally. Hey, hi. I'm here.

1262
01:14:54,367 --> 01:14:56,358
I'm getting ready for the debate.

1263
01:14:56,527 --> 01:14:59,519
- Want to come in?
- No, I'm gonna get going.

1264
01:15:00,367 --> 01:15:02,756
- See you.
- Hold it. What's going on?

1265
01:15:04,367 --> 01:15:05,686
What's all this stuff?

1266
01:15:06,047 --> 01:15:07,719
Oh.
I, um...

1267
01:15:09,087 --> 01:15:13,285
I won Reuben in a putting contest so I
have to make room for some of his stuff.

1268
01:15:13,487 --> 01:15:16,206
- You what?
- I know.

1269
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:21,158
I mean, can you imagine someone
actually playing golf to win a person?

1270
01:15:23,407 --> 01:15:25,637
No. Don't insult me
by trying to defend this...

1271
01:15:25,807 --> 01:15:28,924
...because if I let myself dwell on it,
I'm gonna just lose it.

1272
01:15:29,127 --> 01:15:32,199
- But Sally, it wasn't... Easy.
- I said, no.

1273
01:15:32,367 --> 01:15:35,882
I just want to settle this amicably, okay?
There's your stuff.

1274
01:15:36,047 --> 01:15:39,881
My stuff? Hold on. Hold on.
This is yours.

1275
01:15:41,887 --> 01:15:44,606
Remember? From me.

1276
01:15:44,967 --> 01:15:46,525
Christmas.

1277
01:15:47,607 --> 01:15:50,644
Don't you remember?
That was the year the power went out.

1278
01:15:50,847 --> 01:15:54,806
We had that big snowstorm,
and we were so frustrated.

1279
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:57,646
We couldn't turn this on and watch it.

1280
01:15:58,887 --> 01:16:02,323
And the power came back,
and we turned it on.

1281
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:05,878
And you looked so beautiful...

1282
01:16:06,767 --> 01:16:08,598
...by the light of it.

1283
01:16:09,167 --> 01:16:10,725
And then we...

1284
01:16:11,927 --> 01:16:13,645
...you know...

1285
01:16:14,167 --> 01:16:15,441
...by the light of it.

1286
01:16:16,607 --> 01:16:18,404
I remember.

1287
01:16:20,167 --> 01:16:22,283
And then we stayed up all night
and talked.

1288
01:16:22,487 --> 01:16:24,205
Yeah. Yeah.

1289
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:27,558
Do you remember what
we talked about?

1290
01:16:32,607 --> 01:16:34,279
The future.

1291
01:16:35,127 --> 01:16:37,561
We talked about the future, Handy.

1292
01:16:44,047 --> 01:16:45,924
Sally, wait.

1293
01:16:47,687 --> 01:16:49,518
I don't want to wait anymore.

1294
01:16:50,927 --> 01:16:53,316
- Good luck at the debate.
- Are you coming?

1295
01:17:01,767 --> 01:17:03,439
She's not coming.

1296
01:17:19,567 --> 01:17:22,604
All right, guys, that's it.
We go in two minutes.

1297
01:17:25,247 --> 01:17:27,966
Two minutes, Mr. President.
Excuse me, sir.

1298
01:17:28,167 --> 01:17:30,965
I'm shaking. I can't go to
the bathroom, I'll pee all over.

1299
01:17:31,127 --> 01:17:33,402
- Relax, honey.
- I'm not ready for this.

1300
01:17:33,647 --> 01:17:35,000
Two minutes, Handy.

1301
01:17:35,207 --> 01:17:39,883
Be on your toes. Be sharp. You may have
won the first debate, but he's a python.

1302
01:17:40,047 --> 01:17:42,641
Gentlemen, I believe we're ready.

1303
01:17:43,287 --> 01:17:44,561
It's starting!

1304
01:17:44,727 --> 01:17:49,005
<i>Live from the seaport town of</i>
<i>Mooseport, Maine: The mayoral debates. </i>

1305
01:17:49,167 --> 01:17:53,797
<i>With your candidates: Monroe "Eagle"</i>
<i>Cole and Harold "Handy" Harrison. </i>

1306
01:17:54,007 --> 01:17:57,363
<i>We take you now to your moderator,</i>
<i>Avery Hightower. </i>

1307
01:17:59,967 --> 01:18:02,959
<i>Good evening, I'm Avery Hightower. </i>

1308
01:18:05,407 --> 01:18:07,398
I am honored to moderate...

1309
01:18:07,607 --> 01:18:12,522
...the second and final
Mooseport mayoral debate.

1310
01:18:15,407 --> 01:18:19,559
As is tradition, we will start with
a game of Rock Paper Scissors.

1311
01:18:19,727 --> 01:18:21,797
Handy, not scissors.

1312
01:18:22,287 --> 01:18:23,879
Gentlemen.

1313
01:18:26,607 --> 01:18:31,283
Mr. Hightower, could I...? I'd like to
make a statement first, if that's okay.

1314
01:18:32,047 --> 01:18:35,403
- Mr. President?
- That's fine. I have a statement also.

1315
01:18:35,767 --> 01:18:38,281
- Just... Okay? Thank you.
- All right. Yes. Gentlemen.

1316
01:18:41,207 --> 01:18:42,720
Hey. Hi, everybody.

1317
01:18:44,167 --> 01:18:46,317
I just want to say one thing.

1318
01:18:46,767 --> 01:18:50,919
I'm a little embarrassed about the way
I've been running my campaign.

1319
01:18:53,367 --> 01:18:59,715
An election, it shouldn't be about
personalities, you know? Or golf.

1320
01:19:01,367 --> 01:19:02,641
Or who we're dating.

1321
01:19:04,887 --> 01:19:07,685
<i>Sally, if you're watching this... </i>

1322
01:19:08,647 --> 01:19:12,322
<i>... I was wrong to bring</i>
<i>our relationship into this. </i>

1323
01:19:13,327 --> 01:19:14,601
<i>I'm sorry. </i>

1324
01:19:15,567 --> 01:19:19,526
<i>I guess I did it again. I just brought</i>
<i>our relationship into it again. </i>

1325
01:19:20,727 --> 01:19:23,958
<i>So I'm sorry for that too. </i>

1326
01:19:24,167 --> 01:19:25,805
I guess what I want to say is...

1327
01:19:26,447 --> 01:19:28,597
...an election should be about the town.

1328
01:19:28,847 --> 01:19:30,997
It should be about what we need...

1329
01:19:31,207 --> 01:19:34,040
...and how we can work together
to get things done.

1330
01:19:34,367 --> 01:19:37,120
The president can do
great things for us.

1331
01:19:37,967 --> 01:19:39,400
- Son of a...
- Bitch.

1332
01:19:39,567 --> 01:19:43,401
Having him as a mayor, it's an opportunity
that we can't pass up, folks.

1333
01:19:43,607 --> 01:19:45,199
Yeah, that's right!

1334
01:19:45,687 --> 01:19:47,279
Tomorrow morning...

1335
01:19:47,447 --> 01:19:49,517
...I'm going to the polls...

1336
01:19:49,767 --> 01:19:52,565
...and I'm casting my vote
for the president...

1337
01:19:52,767 --> 01:19:54,564
...Monroe Cole...

1338
01:19:54,967 --> 01:19:57,561
...for the mayor of Mooseport.

1339
01:20:03,127 --> 01:20:04,719
Son of a bitch.

1340
01:20:06,967 --> 01:20:08,719
Ladies and gentlemen...

1341
01:20:09,367 --> 01:20:12,996
...what you've just seen
is a selfless act.

1342
01:20:15,447 --> 01:20:19,725
Handy Harrison is Mooseport.

1343
01:20:21,967 --> 01:20:23,878
He is Mooseport.

1344
01:20:24,767 --> 01:20:26,166
<i>He knows its problems. </i>

1345
01:20:26,607 --> 01:20:28,325
He knows its pulse.

1346
01:20:28,767 --> 01:20:30,280
He knows its plumbing.

1347
01:20:31,847 --> 01:20:34,361
As only a person who lives here can.

1348
01:20:34,607 --> 01:20:36,165
So tomorrow morning...

1349
01:20:38,087 --> 01:20:41,477
...I'm going to the polls,
and I'm walking into that booth...

1350
01:20:41,887 --> 01:20:44,879
...and opening that ballot,
that simple piece of paper...

1351
01:20:45,087 --> 01:20:48,636
...that our forefathers gave
their lives to secure...

1352
01:20:49,967 --> 01:20:52,561
...and I'm casting my vote
for Harrison.

1353
01:20:52,847 --> 01:20:55,077
Harold "Handy" Harrison.
Let's hear it.

1354
01:21:03,927 --> 01:21:05,406
Man, he's good.

1355
01:21:11,407 --> 01:21:14,922
What you've just seen, ladies and
gentlemen, is politics at its finest.

1356
01:21:15,127 --> 01:21:17,083
Politics as it should be.

1357
01:21:18,647 --> 01:21:19,921
You did good.

1358
01:21:20,447 --> 01:21:21,721
Harrison.

1359
01:21:21,887 --> 01:21:23,639
That was something, Mr. President.

1360
01:21:23,847 --> 01:21:27,283
You son of a bitch! You knew I was
gonna do that, so you did it first!

1361
01:21:27,487 --> 01:21:29,637
- I didn't. How could I know?
- You bugged me!

1362
01:21:29,807 --> 01:21:32,037
What we have witnessed,
on this rare night...

1363
01:21:32,247 --> 01:21:35,478
Bugged you? What are you
talking about? I'm not doing anything.

1364
01:21:35,687 --> 01:21:37,678
...is a show of decency...
- Let me go!

1365
01:21:37,887 --> 01:21:41,243
...a show of inclusiveness...
- Get your hands off of him!

1366
01:21:41,447 --> 01:21:43,722
...a show of mutual respect.

1367
01:21:43,927 --> 01:21:45,565
Gentlemen! Gentlemen! Gentlemen!

1368
01:21:45,727 --> 01:21:47,001
Let go of me!

1369
01:21:47,167 --> 01:21:50,443
It's time to follow their example.
It's time...

1370
01:21:51,767 --> 01:21:53,359
Let go of him!

1371
01:21:55,447 --> 01:21:58,598
Mr. President, are you okay?
I'll get it off, Mr. President.

1372
01:22:00,967 --> 01:22:02,241
Get it off me!

1373
01:22:02,567 --> 01:22:06,037
<i>- Danny, you see that debate last night?</i>
<i>- Did I? Was anybody hurt?</i>

1374
01:22:06,287 --> 01:22:09,040
<i>Miraculously not. </i>
<i>Only minor bruises and abrasions. </i>

1375
01:22:09,247 --> 01:22:10,919
<i>Any idea what the heck happened?</i>

1376
01:22:11,127 --> 01:22:13,641
<i>- They're saying it was a freak accident. </i>
<i>- Very freaky. </i>

1377
01:22:13,847 --> 01:22:15,997
<i>Apparently the stage rigging snapped... </i>

1378
01:22:16,207 --> 01:22:18,801
<i>... and fell on the candidates</i>
<i>while they shook hands. </i>

1379
01:22:18,927 --> 01:22:20,519
<i>Wow. Well, you know what we say:</i>

1380
01:22:20,687 --> 01:22:21,961
<i>It's Mooseport. </i>

1381
01:22:22,167 --> 01:22:23,964
Polls open in 20 minutes,
Mr. President.

1382
01:22:24,127 --> 01:22:26,800
<i>- How about a little music to vote by. </i>
<i>- Good idea. </i>

1383
01:22:33,727 --> 01:22:35,797
- Morning, sir.
- Morning, Mr. President.

1384
01:22:44,207 --> 01:22:47,005
Cloud, pull over here, will you?

1385
01:22:57,207 --> 01:22:58,765
How's your nose?

1386
01:23:00,647 --> 01:23:03,957
It's okay. How's your lip
and your back?

1387
01:23:04,847 --> 01:23:06,963
It's just the lip...

1388
01:23:07,327 --> 01:23:08,885
...and it's fine.

1389
01:23:09,647 --> 01:23:13,765
Well, I just assumed your back hurt,
because, you know...

1390
01:23:14,127 --> 01:23:15,401
...Irma jumping on it.

1391
01:23:23,087 --> 01:23:24,679
Well...

1392
01:23:25,407 --> 01:23:26,886
...see you at the poll.

1393
01:23:27,367 --> 01:23:28,641
You want to hit a few?

1394
01:23:30,367 --> 01:23:32,085
What, just hit them in the water?

1395
01:23:32,287 --> 01:23:33,959
Yeah. It's...

1396
01:23:34,247 --> 01:23:35,999
Martha's into scuba...

1397
01:23:36,167 --> 01:23:39,443
...and in the spring she puts on
a wetsuit and she goes and gets them.

1398
01:23:39,887 --> 01:23:43,084
Somehow or another I can't picture
Martha in a wetsuit.

1399
01:23:43,287 --> 01:23:46,279
Yeah, well, you're lucky.
I can't not picture her.

1400
01:23:47,567 --> 01:23:48,841
All right.

1401
01:23:58,047 --> 01:24:01,562
Oh! You topped,
pulled and hooked it all in one.

1402
01:24:03,127 --> 01:24:07,678
Here. Let me show you. Mr. President,
you've shaken a lot of hands.

1403
01:24:09,927 --> 01:24:11,406
Shake hands with the club.

1404
01:24:11,567 --> 01:24:14,001
- Like this?
- Yes. Now, just look at the ball...

1405
01:24:15,047 --> 01:24:18,039
...and picture like it's
the former first lady.

1406
01:24:18,687 --> 01:24:20,040
Just whack it.

1407
01:24:22,527 --> 01:24:24,199
You bloodsucking vampire!

1408
01:24:27,327 --> 01:24:29,079
You two had issues.

1409
01:24:29,287 --> 01:24:31,005
Oh, Jesus.

1410
01:24:33,367 --> 01:24:35,039
So...

1411
01:24:35,887 --> 01:24:37,684
...how come you didn't ask her?

1412
01:24:37,887 --> 01:24:39,764
- Ask her what?
- You know.

1413
01:24:43,967 --> 01:24:45,798
I don't know. I probably should've.

1414
01:24:47,407 --> 01:24:48,681
Scared, I guess.

1415
01:24:49,167 --> 01:24:53,479
Well, marriage is a scary thing.
I'd be the first one to tell you that.

1416
01:24:53,647 --> 01:24:55,365
But once in a while...

1417
01:24:56,247 --> 01:24:58,477
...there comes along that special girl.

1418
01:24:58,687 --> 01:25:02,600
Well, no, I mean, that's just it.
I mean, she is special.

1419
01:25:03,887 --> 01:25:06,765
I just figured, eventually...

1420
01:25:07,647 --> 01:25:09,603
...she'll find somebody else.

1421
01:25:10,487 --> 01:25:15,356
And, you know, you always hope
that next guy will be some loser...

1422
01:25:17,247 --> 01:25:19,078
...not the president.

1423
01:25:22,927 --> 01:25:24,201
Handy...

1424
01:25:24,367 --> 01:25:28,042
...on the 16th hole of our match,
you laid up.

1425
01:25:28,407 --> 01:25:30,204
Yeah. I remember, I did.

1426
01:25:30,447 --> 01:25:33,484
- But you played it safe.
- So? You ended up in the water.

1427
01:25:33,647 --> 01:25:38,562
I never would've been president of
the United States if I'd have laid up.

1428
01:25:49,807 --> 01:25:52,401
Sometimes you just gotta
go for the green.

1429
01:25:55,247 --> 01:25:57,078
Let's go vote.

1430
01:26:01,127 --> 01:26:02,640
- Out of the way!
- Here he is!

1431
01:26:02,847 --> 01:26:05,600
Hank, get them out of the way!
Hold them back!

1432
01:26:06,647 --> 01:26:09,161
Mr. President! Over here,
we have some questions.

1433
01:26:10,967 --> 01:26:13,083
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

1434
01:26:13,487 --> 01:26:16,399
Please step back. No comments
today. There'll be no questions.

1435
01:26:16,607 --> 01:26:19,883
There'll be chances to get wonderful
photos as soon as he's ready.

1436
01:26:20,087 --> 01:26:21,156
Please, one picture!

1437
01:26:23,047 --> 01:26:25,356
Mr. President, over there.

1438
01:26:26,887 --> 01:26:28,036
The pageantry of...

1439
01:26:28,487 --> 01:26:29,476
...democracy.

1440
01:26:29,687 --> 01:26:32,281
That's why we... That's why
we love Mooseport so much.

1441
01:26:35,727 --> 01:26:37,558
Once a politician...

1442
01:26:43,847 --> 01:26:45,644
...always a politician.

1443
01:26:46,447 --> 01:26:47,846
<i>It's 10 minutes past the hour... </i>

1444
01:26:48,007 --> 01:26:51,556
<i>... and there are 20 minutes left before</i>
<i>the polls close in Mooseport, Maine. </i>

1445
01:26:51,727 --> 01:26:56,676
<i>With the former president's campaign</i>
<i>spending millions on advertising... </i>

1446
01:26:56,847 --> 01:27:01,477
<i>... it's amazing that Handy's grass-roots</i>
<i>campaign still has them neck and neck. </i>

1447
01:27:01,687 --> 01:27:05,157
It was so beautiful.

1448
01:27:15,727 --> 01:27:17,001
Hello.

1449
01:27:18,167 --> 01:27:19,885
Spectacular, isn't it?

1450
01:27:20,047 --> 01:27:22,800
- I was thinking about...
- For once, don't talk, please.

1451
01:27:23,007 --> 01:27:26,761
- What?
- Just listen. Okay? Can you do that?

1452
01:27:29,047 --> 01:27:32,722
A long while back my mom
asked me what I saw in you.

1453
01:27:32,927 --> 01:27:37,000
You probably find it hard to believe
that anybody could ask such a thing...

1454
01:27:37,167 --> 01:27:38,759
...but she did.

1455
01:27:40,607 --> 01:27:43,804
"I see a man I admire," I told her.

1456
01:27:44,007 --> 01:27:48,364
"A flawed man, certainly,
but a man with principles. "

1457
01:27:49,647 --> 01:27:51,717
Since this Handy thing...

1458
01:27:53,007 --> 01:27:58,604
...I've seen a man who only cares
about ego and power.

1459
01:27:58,767 --> 01:28:01,804
A man who will stoop to anything...

1460
01:28:01,967 --> 01:28:04,356
...to win a position
he doesn't even want...

1461
01:28:04,567 --> 01:28:07,400
...from someone he probably
shouldn't even beat.

1462
01:28:07,607 --> 01:28:11,998
And it angers me. And it upsets me.

1463
01:28:12,167 --> 01:28:14,761
- Oh, and mostly it just makes me sad.
- Grace...

1464
01:28:14,887 --> 01:28:18,800
Because you used to be
better than that, Monroe.

1465
01:28:19,007 --> 01:28:20,520
You really were.

1466
01:28:30,887 --> 01:28:33,959
And that is no handshake,
you son of a bitch.

1467
01:28:46,327 --> 01:28:47,601
Sugar, Mr. President?

1468
01:28:48,367 --> 01:28:49,959
Oh, three, please.

1469
01:28:50,167 --> 01:28:52,920
No, no, no. One.

1470
01:28:53,407 --> 01:28:55,238
- Morning, Mr. President.
- Good morning.

1471
01:28:55,887 --> 01:28:58,082
- Where's Grace?
- I don't know, sir.

1472
01:28:58,247 --> 01:28:59,521
Could you find her, please?

1473
01:28:59,687 --> 01:29:01,962
Yes, sir. Let's go.

1474
01:29:04,327 --> 01:29:08,718
We gotta get moving. They want you
down in town for the announcement.

1475
01:29:08,927 --> 01:29:12,681
Announcement? I can't expose myself
to that without knowing who won.

1476
01:29:12,887 --> 01:29:15,276
They won't tell me, Eagle.
I've done everything...

1477
01:29:15,487 --> 01:29:18,957
...short of bribing them with a year's
supply of beer and night crawlers...

1478
01:29:19,167 --> 01:29:21,362
...but I'll get down there
and work on it.

1479
01:29:21,767 --> 01:29:25,521
Get on that toga and get down
to that circus, Eagle. Please, sir.

1480
01:29:28,007 --> 01:29:29,645
Sally...

1481
01:29:31,607 --> 01:29:33,518
Handy, you back here?

1482
01:29:35,927 --> 01:29:37,645
- It's time, man.
- Yeah, I know.

1483
01:29:37,847 --> 01:29:40,884
Come on. Don't you want to find out
if you won? Or lost? Badly?

1484
01:29:41,047 --> 01:29:42,958
- Yeah. Go ahead.
- No, I'll wait for you.

1485
01:29:43,127 --> 01:29:44,606
- I'll meet you there.
- I want to.

1486
01:29:44,807 --> 01:29:46,399
- No, go.
- You're my ride, man.

1487
01:29:46,887 --> 01:29:49,276
- Come on.
- Okay. All right. Let's go. Come on.

1488
01:29:58,047 --> 01:30:02,723
In a few moments, former President Cole
and Handy Harrison are due to arrive.

1489
01:30:02,967 --> 01:30:06,642
Will big politics and big money carry
the day? Or will the little man prevail?

1490
01:30:06,807 --> 01:30:09,162
- We shall soon see.
- Testing. Testing.

1491
01:30:09,327 --> 01:30:10,965
We're just about ready to start.

1492
01:30:11,127 --> 01:30:13,880
And I think I see the president
coming now!

1493
01:30:18,087 --> 01:30:19,964
Oh, there's Handy.

1494
01:30:20,887 --> 01:30:22,957
- Hey, did you see Sally?
- No.

1495
01:30:23,567 --> 01:30:25,842
When you see her,
just let me know, okay?

1496
01:30:26,047 --> 01:30:28,766
Mr. President, Handy,
please come up here, okay?

1497
01:30:28,967 --> 01:30:33,836
Sir, the yellow speech is if you win.
The blue one is if you...

1498
01:30:34,807 --> 01:30:37,002
Should I get out of your eyeline, sir?

1499
01:30:38,487 --> 01:30:39,840
Come on, Bullard.

1500
01:30:40,807 --> 01:30:42,763
- How you doing?
- How you doing?

1501
01:30:53,807 --> 01:30:55,684
Handy, you're the man!

1502
01:30:56,727 --> 01:31:00,003
In the 240-year history
of our fair Mooseport...

1503
01:31:00,207 --> 01:31:03,916
...there has never been
a more exciting mayoral race.

1504
01:31:06,647 --> 01:31:09,320
Mr. President. Handy.

1505
01:31:09,887 --> 01:31:13,596
My fellow citizens,
the new mayor of Mooseport is...

1506
01:31:17,127 --> 01:31:19,561
...Monroe Cole!

1507
01:31:25,007 --> 01:31:26,804
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1508
01:31:30,007 --> 01:31:34,046
As I'm sure you all know, this was
Mooseport's largest election turnout ever.

1509
01:31:34,247 --> 01:31:38,365
- How big a margin?
- Real tight. But the win's the thing.

1510
01:31:38,567 --> 01:31:41,843
- It was so close.
- Well, that's something, right?

1511
01:31:42,047 --> 01:31:46,563
In the end, the president won
by one vote!

1512
01:31:46,767 --> 01:31:48,485
You won by one vote.

1513
01:31:48,687 --> 01:31:51,440
One vote? Oh, my God.

1514
01:31:51,647 --> 01:31:54,480
It doesn't get any closer.

1515
01:31:54,727 --> 01:31:56,240
Ladies and gentlemen...

1516
01:31:56,407 --> 01:31:59,479
- One vote.
... the 23rd mayor of Mooseport:

1517
01:32:00,247 --> 01:32:02,203
Monroe "Eagle" Cole!

1518
01:32:05,527 --> 01:32:07,040
Thank you, Morris.

1519
01:32:08,807 --> 01:32:10,445
Thank you, everybody.

1520
01:32:11,487 --> 01:32:13,284
Ladies and gentlemen...

1521
01:32:13,487 --> 01:32:19,926
...once again, the great
American electoral process has...

1522
01:32:27,927 --> 01:32:30,316
Folks, you know...

1523
01:32:31,207 --> 01:32:34,677
...a little while ago, a person
who has been with me for years...

1524
01:32:34,887 --> 01:32:37,606
...a person who I trust
like no one else...

1525
01:32:37,807 --> 01:32:41,038
...reminded me of my principles...

1526
01:32:41,367 --> 01:32:44,757
...shook some sense into me.
So I have a confession to make.

1527
01:32:44,967 --> 01:32:46,798
I said...

1528
01:32:47,607 --> 01:32:51,839
...that I would vote for Handy.
I didn't. I voted for myself.

1529
01:32:56,887 --> 01:32:59,003
So my first act as mayor...

1530
01:32:59,207 --> 01:33:02,961
...is to turn the job over to the
rightful winner, Handy Harrison.

1531
01:33:03,167 --> 01:33:05,840
Handy, come on over here.
Let's hear it for Handy.

1532
01:33:10,567 --> 01:33:13,206
- All right!
- Come on.

1533
01:33:14,487 --> 01:33:15,761
Mr. President...

1534
01:33:15,967 --> 01:33:17,446
Attaboy, Handy!

1535
01:33:17,927 --> 01:33:20,885
Folks, I have a confession
to make also.

1536
01:33:24,887 --> 01:33:27,117
- I voted for myself too.
- What?

1537
01:33:28,967 --> 01:33:31,720
You won this thing fair and square,
Mr. President.

1538
01:33:33,167 --> 01:33:37,843
So my first act as mayor is to turn the
job back over to the rightful winner...

1539
01:33:38,007 --> 01:33:39,838
...Mr. Monroe Cole!

1540
01:33:44,967 --> 01:33:46,480
There's no beating you, is there?

1541
01:33:47,927 --> 01:33:49,724
Not on this one, sir.

1542
01:33:50,487 --> 01:33:51,761
All right, I accept.

1543
01:33:57,767 --> 01:33:59,200
No, he won.

1544
01:33:59,927 --> 01:34:02,521
Tell HarperCollins Random House
is back up to 20 mil.

1545
01:34:02,727 --> 01:34:05,366
Yes, please do.

1546
01:34:05,807 --> 01:34:08,082
And tell them to send me half.

1547
01:34:08,727 --> 01:34:10,524
See you in D.C.

1548
01:34:16,407 --> 01:34:19,558
- Any sign of her?
- Agent Cloud found her at the airport.

1549
01:34:19,767 --> 01:34:22,486
- Airport? Come on, let's get moving.
- You got it.

1550
01:34:24,567 --> 01:34:27,798
Look, Sally...
I don't know...

1551
01:34:28,887 --> 01:34:31,321
- Hey, Handy, nice try.
- Thank you.

1552
01:34:31,527 --> 01:34:34,200
- Hi, Handy.
- Hi, Sophie. Hi.

1553
01:34:37,247 --> 01:34:39,078
Look, Sally...

1554
01:34:39,967 --> 01:34:41,480
...how you doing?

1555
01:34:42,287 --> 01:34:44,676
God, just do it.

1556
01:34:45,207 --> 01:34:48,085
- Just do it.
- Handy, I just saw what you did!

1557
01:34:48,287 --> 01:34:50,960
- I couldn't believe it!
- Thank you, Reuben.

1558
01:34:51,167 --> 01:34:53,442
I voted for you!

1559
01:34:53,687 --> 01:34:55,962
Oh, well, you don't even like me. Sorry.

1560
01:35:01,847 --> 01:35:03,565
What?

1561
01:35:05,207 --> 01:35:06,959
No.

1562
01:35:07,847 --> 01:35:10,520
Please, please, please. No!

1563
01:35:12,007 --> 01:35:14,123
Oh! Nice!

1564
01:35:23,087 --> 01:35:24,361
Ladies and gentlemen...

1565
01:35:24,527 --> 01:35:28,645
...Trans Capital flight 27 to Dulles
has been delayed.

1566
01:35:28,847 --> 01:35:32,157
Please bear with us and we'll let
you know as soon as we know.

1567
01:35:32,367 --> 01:35:34,085
- Oh, man.
- Grace?

1568
01:35:36,407 --> 01:35:37,681
- Grace?
- Here, Mr. President.

1569
01:35:41,687 --> 01:35:44,645
- What are you doing here?
- I gave my notice, remember?

1570
01:35:44,847 --> 01:35:46,485
Oh, Grace. Come back.

1571
01:35:46,647 --> 01:35:47,966
No.

1572
01:35:51,527 --> 01:35:53,995
- No.
- Grace...

1573
01:35:54,927 --> 01:35:56,360
...look at me.

1574
01:35:56,527 --> 01:36:00,725
I'll never have more than one sugar in
my coffee ever again, if you'll have me.

1575
01:36:02,407 --> 01:36:03,681
And no salt.

1576
01:36:05,567 --> 01:36:09,845
The former president of the United
States is down on his knees.

1577
01:36:20,087 --> 01:36:22,282
And that's no handshake, either.

1578
01:36:23,447 --> 01:36:25,722
- I'll go down on my knees again.
- No, no.

1579
01:36:28,007 --> 01:36:30,396
You certainly took your time.

1580
01:36:30,647 --> 01:36:32,319
What if my plane had left?

1581
01:36:32,527 --> 01:36:34,245
Oh, you haven't heard.

1582
01:36:34,447 --> 01:36:36,324
I'm the mayor now.

1583
01:36:38,167 --> 01:36:39,646
This is Cloud. Clear the flight.

1584
01:36:39,807 --> 01:36:42,526
Turns out I have a little bit of pull
at this airport now.

1585
01:36:43,367 --> 01:36:48,122
Flight 27 passengers,
we've now been cleared for takeoff.

1586
01:36:48,407 --> 01:36:51,001
Congratulations, Mr. President.

1587
01:36:51,247 --> 01:36:55,286
That would be,
"Congratulations, Mr. Mayor. "

1588
01:36:56,847 --> 01:36:58,121
Congratulations, Mr. Mayor.

1589
01:36:58,967 --> 01:37:00,525
Great.

1590
01:37:03,127 --> 01:37:04,879
Congratulations, Mr. Mayor.

1591
01:37:05,327 --> 01:37:06,646
Come on.

1592
01:37:10,807 --> 01:37:12,718
Are you doing the plumbing
for the town?

1593
01:37:13,327 --> 01:37:14,965
No. I came to see you.

1594
01:37:15,287 --> 01:37:18,359
- Through the drain?
- Just one second.

1595
01:37:21,847 --> 01:37:23,439
Look, Sally...

1596
01:37:24,087 --> 01:37:26,317
...I was gonna prepare
this whole speech.

1597
01:37:26,527 --> 01:37:28,040
What?

1598
01:37:32,327 --> 01:37:34,477
I was gonna prepare
this whole speech.

1599
01:37:34,687 --> 01:37:37,918
But I think it's better if I
just say this out of the moment.

1600
01:37:38,127 --> 01:37:39,446
All right.

1601
01:37:39,967 --> 01:37:41,605
The truth is, you're beautiful.

1602
01:37:41,807 --> 01:37:44,640
And you're smart and wonderful.

1603
01:37:46,967 --> 01:37:48,525
And I'm not...

1604
01:37:49,047 --> 01:37:50,321
- I'm not.
- Handy, I...

1605
01:37:50,487 --> 01:37:53,524
Hang on, because I'm
in the moment now.

1606
01:37:53,767 --> 01:37:58,761
This whole thing, it's made me
take a pretty hard look at myself.

1607
01:37:59,047 --> 01:38:01,766
And I'm not smart
and I'm not beautiful.

1608
01:38:02,807 --> 01:38:06,163
But hell, I just beat the most
popular president in history.

1609
01:38:06,327 --> 01:38:07,885
So...

1610
01:38:08,847 --> 01:38:11,042
...maybe I'm okay.
- Almost.

1611
01:38:11,847 --> 01:38:13,519
You almost beat him.

1612
01:38:13,727 --> 01:38:16,924
Sally, between me and you,
just our little secret...

1613
01:38:17,127 --> 01:38:18,446
...I beat him.

1614
01:38:18,607 --> 01:38:22,395
Do you think I'd have voted for myself
after I told the whole town I wouldn't?

1615
01:38:23,127 --> 01:38:24,401
You gave it away?

1616
01:38:25,487 --> 01:38:29,275
- Why?
- Because he needs it, I don't.

1617
01:38:33,167 --> 01:38:34,998
I only need you.

1618
01:38:36,167 --> 01:38:37,646
And that's...

1619
01:38:38,087 --> 01:38:39,884
That's my speech.

1620
01:38:40,487 --> 01:38:42,000
Oh, Handy.

1621
01:38:44,287 --> 01:38:45,686
Hold on. I got...

1622
01:38:45,847 --> 01:38:47,326
I got you something.

1623
01:38:47,847 --> 01:38:49,246
- Dirt?
- No.

1624
01:38:50,407 --> 01:38:52,363
It's dirty, but...

1625
01:38:53,887 --> 01:38:55,605
Look, I don't know how you feel.

1626
01:39:04,087 --> 01:39:06,885
- Is that a "yes" kiss?
- Yes.

1627
01:39:08,647 --> 01:39:09,921
It's dirty now, but it's...

1628
01:39:10,087 --> 01:39:12,237
- It's really... It's beautiful.
- It's beautiful.

1629
01:39:12,407 --> 01:39:16,400
It's big and... That's not just one
diamond, there's diamonds on the side.

1630
01:39:16,607 --> 01:39:18,325
It's diamonds and mud.

1631
01:39:18,487 --> 01:39:22,560
Did I say in the speech...? I forgot the
whole part about how much I love you.

1632
01:39:22,727 --> 01:39:25,639
I didn't say it, but... Yes, I didn't...
You know, there's no...

1633
01:39:25,807 --> 01:39:28,958
I didn't make a word thing out of it,
but you can't even measure it.

1634
01:39:29,127 --> 01:39:31,516
It's like... Like, if you take the sun...

1635
01:39:31,767 --> 01:39:34,235
You can take the heat
from that sun and you...

1636
01:39:34,407 --> 01:39:39,435
If you put all of that
in a love container, you...

1637
01:39:40,527 --> 01:39:42,643
- Got it. Yes.
- You get it?

1638
01:39:42,807 --> 01:39:46,516
But you said yes anyway. So this
is all extra. It's like a bonus to it.

1639
01:39:46,887 --> 01:39:49,276
- My heart's beating fast.
- Let's go.

1640
01:39:49,487 --> 01:39:51,205
Plunger, come on. Come on.

1641
01:39:51,367 --> 01:39:52,641
How'd it get in the sewer?

1642
01:39:52,807 --> 01:39:56,243
Oh, that's... You know,
things just happen to me. Yeah.

1643
01:39:56,447 --> 01:39:58,836
Did I happen to notice
you're wearing a thong?

1644
01:40:01,607 --> 01:40:03,598
My God! Are you okay?

1645
01:40:04,287 --> 01:40:07,120
- You did it again.
- I barely touched you.

1646
01:40:07,287 --> 01:40:12,077
If this marriage is gonna work, you have
to realize how strong you are, okay?

1647
01:40:12,247 --> 01:40:14,124
You're stronger than me. Accept it.

1648
01:40:14,287 --> 01:40:15,925
- I'm not stronger than you.
- You are.

1649
01:40:16,087 --> 01:40:17,406
- I'm a girl.
- That's right.

1650
01:40:17,567 --> 01:40:20,718
So it hurts physically and emotionally.
Come on, boys.

1651
01:40:21,087 --> 01:40:23,442
What about this? Bow on my head.

1652
01:40:23,607 --> 01:40:25,802
A bow on your... In white, I'd buy it.

1653
01:40:25,967 --> 01:40:27,685
- I'm serious.
- I like that neckline.

1654
01:40:27,847 --> 01:40:29,644
Excuse me, ladies.

1655
01:40:29,807 --> 01:40:32,401
- Is Handy around?
- Handy?

1656
01:40:32,567 --> 01:40:34,444
You've got company.

1657
01:40:38,167 --> 01:40:41,239
- How you doing?
- Congratulations, Handy.

1658
01:40:41,447 --> 01:40:45,076
You almost beat the most popular
president in history.

1659
01:40:45,287 --> 01:40:48,165
- Thank you. No hard feelings, right?
- Are you kidding?

1660
01:40:48,367 --> 01:40:51,996
Let me cut to the chase.
What are you doing in about two years?

1661
01:40:52,207 --> 01:40:55,643
- What do you mean?
- How does "Governor Harrison" sound?

1662
01:40:55,847 --> 01:40:57,439
Governor?

1663
01:40:59,447 --> 01:41:01,199
Yeah, no. Thank you.

1664
01:41:01,407 --> 01:41:03,284
We've got a real possibility here.

1665
01:41:04,007 --> 01:41:08,558
Thank you. I appreciate that you're
thinking about me and everything...

1666
01:41:08,967 --> 01:41:11,356
...but I'm kind of happy
right where I am.

1667
01:41:11,567 --> 01:41:14,843
Well, I'll respect that. Okay.

1668
01:41:15,287 --> 01:41:17,039
Have a good day.

1669
01:41:19,607 --> 01:41:21,359
Hey, hold on one second.

1670
01:41:22,167 --> 01:41:23,441
Let me just ask you.

1671
01:41:24,087 --> 01:41:25,884
Can a governor...

1672
01:41:26,047 --> 01:41:28,083
...kind of tell a mayor what to do?

1673
01:41:29,287 --> 01:41:30,959
Oh, yeah.

1674
01:41:35,927 --> 01:41:38,521
What...? I thought I... I told you...

1675
01:45:58,567 --> 01:46:00,558
