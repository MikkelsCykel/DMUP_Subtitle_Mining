STEPHANIE: We've0 days to get the money.
JIMMY: ''We''?

If you want to live here,
you got to start chipping in.

Where's Greg's settlement cheque?
Get the money from him.

636
00:41:24,318 --> 00:41:25,277
I can't.

He's going to ask me and Lily
to move away with him.

I can't freak him out--

Mum, stop living
your life like this!

If you cared about Lily, you'd get
a job and quit fucking around.

641
00:41:39,832 --> 00:41:42,084
I got to go. I'll be late for work.

Why does Manny give me
so much shit all the time?

655
00:42:49,688 --> 00:42:51,898
Maybe because
you give him reason to.

Stick to the plan, man.

657

I left you the car.

666
00:43:30,017 --> 00:43:31,810
Was it 'cause I said I was pregnant?

667

Those white boys are
more like busters on serious shit.
