1
00:01:18,567 --> 00:01:20,124
Where are they?

2
00:01:20,606 --> 00:01:23,961
Talk, you unreconstructed whelp
of a whore!

3
00:01:24,445 --> 00:01:25,923
Where they headed?

4
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:29,597
Your screams ain't gonna save your flesh.

5
00:01:30,163 --> 00:01:31,959
Only your tongue is, boy.

6
00:01:32,042 --> 00:01:33,872
Now, where are they headed?

7
00:01:46,477 --> 00:01:47,750
Lump. I.O.

8
00:01:55,354 --> 00:01:57,991
Sweet summer rain.

9
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,503
Like God's own mercy.

10
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:07,098
Your two friends have abandoned you,
Pete.

11
00:02:07,909 --> 00:02:10,217
They don't seem to care about your hide.

12
00:02:15,226 --> 00:02:16,261
Okay.

13
00:02:21,743 --> 00:02:23,859
Stairway to heaven, Pete.

14
00:02:27,222 --> 00:02:29,097
We shall all meet, by and by.

15
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,178
Goddamn it!

16
00:02:33,699 --> 00:02:35,451
God forgive me!

17
00:02:48,974 --> 00:02:51,964
Believe me, Delmar,
he would've wanted us to press on.

18
00:02:52,053 --> 00:02:54,088
Pete, rest his soul...

19
00:02:54,612 --> 00:02:57,079
...was one sour-assed son of a bitch
and not given...

20
00:02:57,171 --> 00:02:58,922
...to acts of pointless sentimentality.

21
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:02,125
It just don't seem right,
diggin' up that treasure without him.

22
00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:04,847
Maybe it was for the best
that he was squished.

23
00:03:05,967 --> 00:03:08,002
He was barely a sentient being.

24
00:03:09,126 --> 00:03:12,834
As soon as we get ourselves cleaned up,
get a little smell'um in our hair...

25
00:03:12,925 --> 00:03:16,359
...we're going to feel 100 percent better
about ourselves and...

26
00:03:17,043 --> 00:03:18,476
...about life in general.

27
00:03:20,003 --> 00:03:22,232
We must be near Parchman Farm.

28
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,069
Sorry sons of bitches.

29
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,998
Seems like a year ago
we bust off the farm.

30
00:03:38,275 --> 00:03:39,833
Pete got a brother?

31
00:03:40,474 --> 00:03:41,907
Not that I'm aware of.

32
00:03:45,753 --> 00:03:47,470
Heat must be gettin' to me.

33
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:57,825
"Though the storm
and its furies rage today"

34
00:03:59,508 --> 00:04:03,135
"Crushing hope that we cherish so dear"

35
00:04:04,026 --> 00:04:07,620
"The cloud and storm
will in time pass away"

36
00:04:09,224 --> 00:04:12,693
"And the sun again will shine
bright and clear"

37
00:04:14,782 --> 00:04:19,376
"Keep on the sunny side
always on the sunny side"

38
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:22,337
"Keep on the sunny side of life"

39
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:25,813
"It will help us every day"

40
00:04:25,978 --> 00:04:28,286
"It will brighten all the way"

41
00:04:28,376 --> 00:04:31,890
"If you keep on the sunny side of life"

42
00:04:33,255 --> 00:04:36,928
"If you keep on the sunny side of life"

43
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:41,404
That was wonderful.

44
00:04:43,771 --> 00:04:46,568
Now, I know,
the Sunny Siders would agree with me...

45
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:49,243
...when I say
that the greatstate of Mississippi...

46
00:04:49,329 --> 00:04:52,638
...can not afford four more years
of Pappy O' Daniel.

47
00:04:53,328 --> 00:04:55,795
Four more years of cronyism!

48
00:04:56,086 --> 00:05:00,601
Nepotism! Rascalism!
And service to the interests.

49
00:05:03,483 --> 00:05:05,917
Now, the choice, she is clear.

50
00:05:06,282 --> 00:05:09,433
Pappy O'Daniel, slave of the interests.

51
00:05:10,241 --> 00:05:13,199
Homer Stokes, servant of the little man.

52
00:05:13,441 --> 00:05:15,954
Ain't that right, little fella?
- He ain't lyin'.

53
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:17,552
And ladies and gentlemen...

54
00:05:17,638 --> 00:05:19,594
...the little man has admonished me...

55
00:05:19,678 --> 00:05:24,386
...to grasp the broom of reform
and sweep this state clean.

56
00:05:25,156 --> 00:05:28,431
It's gonna be:
"Back to the flour mill, Pappy."

57
00:05:28,515 --> 00:05:30,744
The interests can take care of themselves.

58
00:05:30,834 --> 00:05:34,223
Come Tuesday,
we're gonna sweep the rascals out.

59
00:05:36,352 --> 00:05:39,582
Clean government, yours for the asking.

60
00:05:42,589 --> 00:05:45,148
Now, the Little Wharvey Gals.

61
00:05:46,468 --> 00:05:50,459
"Wharvey Gals"?
Did he just say "Little Wharvey Gals"?

62
00:05:51,826 --> 00:05:54,544
Come here, girls,
what are you gonna sing for us?

63
00:05:54,865 --> 00:05:55,979
In the Highways.

64
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,258
In the Highways.

65
00:05:57,344 --> 00:05:58,743
Goddamn it all.

66
00:05:58,823 --> 00:06:00,142
You know them gals?

67
00:06:00,223 --> 00:06:04,692
"In the highways, in the hedges"

68
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,771
"In the highways, in the hedges"

69
00:06:11,979 --> 00:06:14,889
"I'll be somewhere workin' for my Lord"

70
00:06:16,017 --> 00:06:20,134
"I'll be somewhere workin'"

71
00:06:20,215 --> 00:06:23,251
"I'll be somewhere workin' for my Lord"

72
00:06:24,334 --> 00:06:28,325
"I'll be somewhere workin'"

73
00:06:28,412 --> 00:06:31,369
"I'll be somewhere workin' for my Lord"

74
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,881
Girls.
- Daddy!

75
00:06:40,488 --> 00:06:41,363
Daddy?

76
00:06:41,448 --> 00:06:42,597
He ain't our daddy.

77
00:06:42,688 --> 00:06:45,564
Hell, I ain't! What's this Wharvey Gals?
Your name's McGill.

78
00:06:45,646 --> 00:06:47,875
No, sir, not since you got hit by that train.

79
00:06:47,965 --> 00:06:50,035
What are you sayin'?
I wasn't hit by a train.

80
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:51,842
Mama says you was hit by a train.

81
00:06:51,924 --> 00:06:53,481
Blooey.
- Nothin' left.

82
00:06:53,563 --> 00:06:55,553
Just a grease spot on the L&N.

83
00:06:55,643 --> 00:06:57,712
Damn it, I wasn't hit by any train.

84
00:06:57,802 --> 00:07:00,235
That's right,
now Mama's got us back to Wharvey.

85
00:07:00,321 --> 00:07:01,639
That's her maiden name.

86
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,358
You got a maiden name, Daddy?

87
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:05,157
No, Daddy don't have a maiden name--

88
00:07:05,239 --> 00:07:06,592
That's your misfortune.

89
00:07:06,678 --> 00:07:09,112
That's right,
and now Mama's got a new beau.

90
00:07:09,198 --> 00:07:10,676
He's a suitor.

91
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:12,514
Yeah, I heard about that.

92
00:07:12,596 --> 00:07:14,745
Mama says he's bona fide.

93
00:07:17,154 --> 00:07:18,348
He give her a ring?

94
00:07:18,434 --> 00:07:19,912
Yes, sir, a big one.

95
00:07:19,993 --> 00:07:22,109
Gotta gem.
- Mama checked it.

96
00:07:22,193 --> 00:07:23,386
It's bona fide.

97
00:07:23,472 --> 00:07:25,268
He's a suitor.
- What's his name?

98
00:07:25,351 --> 00:07:27,102
Vernon T. Waldrip.

99
00:07:27,191 --> 00:07:28,942
Uncle Vernon.
- Until tomorrow.

100
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,781
Then he's gonna be Daddy.

101
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:34,464
I am the only daddy you got!
I'm the damn paterfamilias.

102
00:07:34,548 --> 00:07:36,697
But you ain't bona fide.

103
00:07:39,946 --> 00:07:41,174
Where's your mama?

104
00:07:41,266 --> 00:07:42,698
She's at the Five 'n' Dime.

105
00:07:42,785 --> 00:07:44,218
Buyin' nipples.

106
00:08:00,178 --> 00:08:02,452
Daddy!
- Hello, sugar.

107
00:08:04,297 --> 00:08:06,127
How's my little girl?

108
00:08:08,015 --> 00:08:10,245
Who the hell is that?
- Starla Wharvey.

109
00:08:10,455 --> 00:08:13,491
Starla McGill, you mean.
How come you never told me about her?

110
00:08:13,574 --> 00:08:15,210
Because you was hit by a train.

111
00:08:15,293 --> 00:08:17,806
Why are you tellin' our gals
I was hit by a train?

112
00:08:17,892 --> 00:08:20,086
Many respectable people
have been hit by trains.

113
00:08:20,171 --> 00:08:22,638
Judge Hobby, over in Cookeville,
was hit by a train.

114
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,209
What was I to tell them?

115
00:08:24,289 --> 00:08:27,598
That you were sent to the penal farm
and I divorced you from shame?

116
00:08:27,689 --> 00:08:31,964
I take your point. But it leaves me in a
awkward position vis-à-vis my progeny.

117
00:08:32,047 --> 00:08:36,516
Hello, Penny.
This gentleman bothering you?

118
00:08:39,204 --> 00:08:40,353
You Waldrip?

119
00:08:41,403 --> 00:08:42,995
That's right.

120
00:08:56,038 --> 00:08:58,107
You been using my hair treatment?

121
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:00,269
Your hair treatment?

122
00:09:00,356 --> 00:09:01,550
Excuse me.

123
00:09:05,034 --> 00:09:08,946
I got news for you, in case
you hadn't noticed. I wasn't hit by a train.

124
00:09:09,193 --> 00:09:12,070
And I have traveled many a weary mile...

125
00:09:12,312 --> 00:09:15,986
...to be back with my wife
and my six daughters.

126
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,102
Seven, Daddy.

127
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:21,180
That ain't your daddy.
Your daddy was hit by a train.

128
00:09:21,268 --> 00:09:23,384
Penny, you stop that.
- No, you stop it.

129
00:09:23,468 --> 00:09:27,823
Vernon, here, has got a job, prospects.
He's bona fide. What are you?

130
00:09:27,906 --> 00:09:31,419
I'll tell you what I am,
I'm the paterfamilias.

131
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:34,540
And you can't marry him.
- I can, I am, and I will.

132
00:09:34,743 --> 00:09:37,495
Tomorrow.
I got to think about the Wharvey gals.

133
00:09:37,582 --> 00:09:39,094
They look to me for answers.

134
00:09:39,182 --> 00:09:42,138
Vernon can support them
and buy them lessons on the clarinet.

135
00:09:42,221 --> 00:09:45,337
Only good thing you ever did for them
was get hit by that train.

136
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:50,295
Why, you lyin' unconstant, succubus.

137
00:09:52,017 --> 00:09:55,008
You can't swear at my fiancée.
- Yeah?

138
00:09:55,696 --> 00:09:58,528
Well, you can't marry my wife.

139
00:10:19,887 --> 00:10:21,638
Who is that man?

140
00:10:22,806 --> 00:10:24,875
He's not my husband.

141
00:10:25,445 --> 00:10:29,675
Just a drifter, I guess.
Just some no-account drifter.

142
00:10:33,482 --> 00:10:35,472
And stay out of the Woolworths.

143
00:10:41,239 --> 00:10:43,468
Say, I'll bet she does imitations, too.

144
00:10:43,598 --> 00:10:46,907
Deceitful, two-faced, she-woman.

145
00:10:47,956 --> 00:10:49,628
Never trust a female, Delmar.

146
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:51,194
Remember that one precept...

147
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:53,834
...and your time with me
will not have been ill-spent.

148
00:10:53,915 --> 00:10:54,949
Okay, Everett.

149
00:10:55,153 --> 00:10:58,906
"Hit by a train."
Truth means nothin' to a woman, Delmar.

150
00:10:59,432 --> 00:11:02,389
Triumph of the subjective.
You ever been with a woman?

151
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,988
Well....

152
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:09,541
I gotta get the family farm back
before I can start thinkin' about that.

153
00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:12,700
That's right, if then. Believe me, Delmar.

154
00:11:12,788 --> 00:11:14,902
Woman is the most fiendish
instrument...

155
00:11:14,986 --> 00:11:17,704
...of torture ever devised
to be devil the days of man.

156
00:11:19,265 --> 00:11:22,017
Everett, I never figured you
for a paterfamilias.

157
00:11:22,863 --> 00:11:25,297
Yes. I've spread my seed.

158
00:11:26,503 --> 00:11:27,935
Look what it's....

159
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,132
What the hell is going on?

160
00:12:30,278 --> 00:12:33,189
Okay, boys. Enjoy your picture show.

161
00:12:44,873 --> 00:12:49,023
Do not seek the treasure.

162
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:56,860
Do not seek the treasure.

163
00:12:58,509 --> 00:13:00,418
It's a bushwhack.

164
00:13:00,828 --> 00:13:03,021
They're fixin' an ambush.

165
00:13:03,586 --> 00:13:06,782
Do not seek the treasure.

166
00:13:12,903 --> 00:13:17,578
We thought you was a toad.

167
00:13:22,059 --> 00:13:28,656
We thought you was a toad.

168
00:13:31,096 --> 00:13:34,929
Do not seek the treasure.

169
00:13:35,455 --> 00:13:37,603
Quiet there! Watch the picture!

170
00:13:43,691 --> 00:13:47,444
I signed that bill.
I signed a dozen of those agriculture bills.

171
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:50,477
Everyone knows I'm a friend of the farmer.

172
00:13:50,848 --> 00:13:53,487
What have I got to do,
start diddlin' the livestock?

173
00:13:53,647 --> 00:13:57,003
We can't do that, Daddy.
We might offend our constituency.

174
00:13:57,126 --> 00:14:00,640
We ain't got a constituency.
Stokes has got a constituency!

175
00:14:02,524 --> 00:14:06,879
Well, it's a well-run campaign.
Midget and broom and whatnot.

176
00:14:06,963 --> 00:14:09,430
Devil his due.
- Hell of an organization.

177
00:14:09,921 --> 00:14:12,116
Say, I got an idea.

178
00:14:12,201 --> 00:14:13,394
What's that, Junior?

179
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,755
We could hire us a little fella
even smaller than Stokes's.

180
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:19,308
You slope-shouldered sack of nuts!

181
00:14:19,518 --> 00:14:22,156
We'd look like a bunch
of Johnny-come-latelies.

182
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:23,989
Braggin' on our own midget.

183
00:14:24,077 --> 00:14:25,713
Don't matter how stumpy.

184
00:14:25,796 --> 00:14:27,706
That's the goddamn problem, right there.

185
00:14:27,796 --> 00:14:30,592
People think this Stokes
has got fresh ideas.

186
00:14:30,674 --> 00:14:32,664
He's au courant and we're the past.

187
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:36,108
It's a problem of....
- Perception.

188
00:14:36,192 --> 00:14:37,909
The reason he's pullin' our pants down.

189
00:14:37,992 --> 00:14:40,424
Gonna paddle a little behind.
- Ain't gonna paddle.

190
00:14:40,511 --> 00:14:41,659
Gonna kick it, real hard.

191
00:14:41,751 --> 00:14:43,467
No, I believe he's gonna paddle it.

192
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,540
That's not a proper description.

193
00:14:45,629 --> 00:14:47,858
Well, that's how I'd characterize it.

194
00:14:48,067 --> 00:14:50,534
I believe it's more of a kickin' situation.

195
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,493
God forgive me...

196
00:15:10,579 --> 00:15:14,729
...l could not gaze upon that far shore.

197
00:15:15,937 --> 00:15:17,256
Pete.

198
00:15:18,336 --> 00:15:19,655
Hold still.

199
00:15:19,736 --> 00:15:22,568
Can't stand much longer.

200
00:15:24,294 --> 00:15:26,205
It was a moment of weakness.

201
00:15:26,294 --> 00:15:28,284
Quit babblin'. We got to skedaddle.

202
00:15:28,373 --> 00:15:30,124
That's all I got.

203
00:15:30,772 --> 00:15:33,763
They lured me out for a bathe,
then they dunked me...

204
00:15:34,011 --> 00:15:37,400
...and trussed me up like a hog.
And turned me in for the bounty.

205
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:40,242
Should have guessed it,
typical womanly behavior.

206
00:15:40,328 --> 00:15:42,682
Just lucky we left
before they came back for us.

207
00:15:42,767 --> 00:15:46,395
We didn't abandon you, Pete.
We just thought you was a toad.

208
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:49,359
No, they never did turn me into a toad.

209
00:15:49,445 --> 00:15:51,355
Well, that was our mistake, then.

210
00:15:51,804 --> 00:15:54,601
And we was beat up by a Bible salesman...

211
00:15:54,683 --> 00:15:56,753
...and banished from Woolworths.

212
00:15:57,322 --> 00:16:00,472
I don't know, Everett,
was it the one branch or all of them?

213
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,835
Well, I ain't had it easy either, boys.

214
00:16:04,319 --> 00:16:06,514
Frankly, well, I...

215
00:16:08,758 --> 00:16:11,066
...spilled my guts about the treasure.

216
00:16:14,555 --> 00:16:17,433
I'm awful sorry I betrayed you fellas.

217
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:20,902
Must be my Hogwallop blood.

218
00:16:22,952 --> 00:16:24,749
That's all right, Pete.

219
00:16:24,912 --> 00:16:27,664
Awful white of you
to take it like that, Everett.

220
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:33,496
I feel wretched,
spoilin' your play for $1.2 million.

221
00:16:34,709 --> 00:16:36,538
It's been eatin' at my guts.

222
00:16:38,187 --> 00:16:39,665
That's all right.

223
00:16:41,546 --> 00:16:44,378
You boys are true friends.

224
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:48,334
You my boon companions.

225
00:16:49,743 --> 00:16:52,938
Pete, I don't want you
to beat yourself up about this.

226
00:16:53,141 --> 00:16:55,530
I can't help it, but that's...

227
00:16:56,021 --> 00:16:58,453
...a wonderful thing to say.

228
00:17:08,256 --> 00:17:09,893
Fact of the matter is...

229
00:17:13,014 --> 00:17:16,527
...damn it, there ain't no treasure.

230
00:17:20,012 --> 00:17:22,161
Fact of the matter is there never was.

231
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:28,122
So where's all the money
from the armored-car job?

232
00:17:29,608 --> 00:17:31,757
I never knocked over no armored car.

233
00:17:33,126 --> 00:17:36,004
I was sent up for practicing law
without a license.

234
00:17:36,325 --> 00:17:38,714
But....
- Damn it, I had to bust out.

235
00:17:38,805 --> 00:17:42,113
My wife wrote me she was gettin' married.
I gotta stop it.

236
00:17:43,243 --> 00:17:45,836
I had two weeks left of my sentence.

237
00:17:45,922 --> 00:17:48,719
I couldn't wait two weeks,
she's getting married tomorrow.

238
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:51,314
With my added time for the escape...

239
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:56,355
...I don't get out now until 1987.

240
00:17:56,838 --> 00:17:58,509
Now, I am sorry about that.

241
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:02,664
I'll be 84 years old.

242
00:18:04,235 --> 00:18:07,544
I guess they'll tack on 50 years for me, too.

243
00:18:07,794 --> 00:18:10,704
Boys, we was chained together.

244
00:18:10,793 --> 00:18:14,307
I had to tell you something.
Bustin' out alone was not an option.

245
00:18:15,391 --> 00:18:16,380
Sorry.

246
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:19,421
84 years old.

247
00:18:21,109 --> 00:18:23,622
Well, I'll only be 82.

248
00:18:24,308 --> 00:18:27,379
You ruined my life.

249
00:18:27,466 --> 00:18:30,139
You ruined my life.

250
00:18:30,226 --> 00:18:32,136
I do apologize about that, Pete.

251
00:18:32,225 --> 00:18:36,819
84 years old. I'll be gummin' pabulum.

252
00:18:42,341 --> 00:18:44,410
Now, boys. Boys.

253
00:20:17,986 --> 00:20:19,816
It's Tommy. They got Tommy.

254
00:20:20,145 --> 00:20:21,623
Oh, my God.

255
00:20:23,743 --> 00:20:25,176
The noose.

256
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:30,296
Sweet Jesus, we got to save him.

257
00:20:45,575 --> 00:20:46,724
A color guard.

258
00:21:12,325 --> 00:21:13,440
Brothers!

259
00:21:15,564 --> 00:21:19,919
Brothers! We are forgathered here...

260
00:21:20,763 --> 00:21:24,595
...to preserve our hallowed culture
and heritage...

261
00:21:25,361 --> 00:21:26,873
...from intrusion...

262
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,749
...inclusion and dilution...

263
00:21:31,199 --> 00:21:33,553
...of color, of creed...

264
00:21:34,117 --> 00:21:36,391
...and of our old-time religion.

265
00:21:36,716 --> 00:21:40,185
We aim to pull evil up by the root...

266
00:21:40,955 --> 00:21:43,787
...before it chokes out the flower...

267
00:21:44,074 --> 00:21:46,029
...of our culture and heritage.

268
00:21:46,953 --> 00:21:47,988
And our women.

269
00:21:48,072 --> 00:21:50,631
Let's not forget those ladies, y'all.

270
00:21:50,831 --> 00:21:53,106
Looking to us for protection...

271
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:57,627
...from Darkies, from Jews, from Papists...

272
00:21:58,469 --> 00:22:03,177
...and from all those smart-ass folks
say we come descended from monkeys.

273
00:22:04,466 --> 00:22:06,775
That's not my culture and heritage.

274
00:22:07,465 --> 00:22:10,262
Is that your culture and heritage?
- No.

275
00:22:12,303 --> 00:22:16,136
So, we gonna hang us a Negra.

276
00:22:29,577 --> 00:22:32,454
I ain't never harmed you.
Neither of you gentlemen.

277
00:22:55,287 --> 00:22:57,118
I never harmed nobody.

278
00:23:03,164 --> 00:23:05,473
We've come to rescue you.

279
00:23:06,163 --> 00:23:10,280
That's mighty kind of you, but I don't think
nothing is gonna save me now.

280
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:13,157
The Devil's come to collect his due.

281
00:23:14,681 --> 00:23:18,069
Don't be crazy, Tommy,
you don't wanna get hanged.

282
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:20,988
No, I don't reckon I do...

283
00:23:21,678 --> 00:23:24,270
...but that's the way
it seems to be workin' out.

284
00:23:25,877 --> 00:23:27,867
Listen, Tommy, I got a plan.

285
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,589
That color guard is colored.

286
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,981
Who made them the color guard?

287
00:23:45,908 --> 00:23:47,137
Run, boys!

288
00:23:54,186 --> 00:23:55,618
No, son.

289
00:23:58,064 --> 00:24:00,293
Can't let that flag touch the ground.

290
00:24:26,014 --> 00:24:28,163
Get your hand off me, I can do this myself.

291
00:24:28,253 --> 00:24:30,687
Get away.
I didn't tell you to sit over here.

292
00:24:30,772 --> 00:24:33,763
I'm saying we should hire this man away.
- That's a good idea.

293
00:24:33,851 --> 00:24:35,647
Great idea.
- Can't beat 'em, join 'em.

294
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:38,641
Have him join us, run our campaign,
instead of that egghead's.

295
00:24:38,729 --> 00:24:40,560
Enticements of power, wealth, et cetera.

296
00:24:40,689 --> 00:24:42,804
No one says no to Pappy O'Daniel.

297
00:24:42,887 --> 00:24:45,116
Oh, gracious, no,
not with his blandishments.

298
00:24:45,207 --> 00:24:47,800
Powers of persuasion.
- What's his name again?

299
00:24:47,965 --> 00:24:49,603
Campaign manager?
- Yes.

300
00:24:49,685 --> 00:24:51,481
Waldrip.
- Vernon Waldrip.

301
00:24:51,565 --> 00:24:52,963
Vernon T. Waldrip.

302
00:25:00,841 --> 00:25:02,479
It's an invitation-only affair.

303
00:25:02,561 --> 00:25:04,755
We'll have to sneak in
at the service entrance.

304
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,716
Hold on. Wait a minute.

305
00:25:06,999 --> 00:25:09,387
Who elected you leader of this outfit?

306
00:25:09,518 --> 00:25:11,428
Since we've been following your lead...

307
00:25:11,517 --> 00:25:13,235
...we've got nothing but trouble.

308
00:25:13,316 --> 00:25:16,068
I got this close to being strung up...

309
00:25:16,195 --> 00:25:19,231
...and consumed in a fire,
and whipped no end...

310
00:25:19,315 --> 00:25:21,269
...and sun-stroked, and soggied.

311
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:24,623
And turned into a frog.
- He wasn't turned into a frog.

312
00:25:25,512 --> 00:25:27,389
Almost loved up though.

313
00:25:28,831 --> 00:25:30,707
So you're against me now, too.

314
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:34,301
Is that how it is, boys?

315
00:25:36,787 --> 00:25:41,177
The whole world,
and God almighty, and now you.

316
00:25:45,265 --> 00:25:46,698
Guess I deserve it.

317
00:25:49,304 --> 00:25:53,090
Boys, I know that I made
some tactical mistakes...

318
00:25:54,741 --> 00:25:56,537
...but if you just stick with me.

319
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:59,692
I got a plan, believe me, boys,
we can fix this thing.

320
00:25:59,859 --> 00:26:02,850
And I can get my wife back
and we can get out of here.

321
00:26:06,137 --> 00:26:08,969
Goddamn disgrace!

322
00:26:09,296 --> 00:26:11,525
Made a travesty of the entire evening.

323
00:26:12,015 --> 00:26:15,484
Oh, what I wouldn't give
to get ahold of those agitators.

324
00:26:15,893 --> 00:26:19,407
I mean, whoever heard of such behavior?
Even amongst the colored.

325
00:26:19,492 --> 00:26:22,801
Or mulattos, maybe. I suspect
some miscegenation in the heritage.

326
00:26:22,891 --> 00:26:26,723
How else you gonna explain it?
Using the Confederate flag as a missile.

327
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:30,244
No one's ever gonna believe
we're a real band.

328
00:26:30,328 --> 00:26:33,239
This'll work. I need to get close enough
to talk to her.

329
00:26:33,327 --> 00:26:36,443
Coming with us has more future
than marrying a guy named Waldrip.

330
00:26:36,525 --> 00:26:38,992
I'm goddamn bona fide.
I've got the answers.

331
00:26:39,365 --> 00:26:41,161
Everett, my beard itches.

332
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:57,194
In the Jailhouse Now, fellas.
Neighborhood of B.

333
00:27:09,993 --> 00:27:11,312
It's me.

334
00:27:12,352 --> 00:27:12,989
No.

335
00:27:16,391 --> 00:27:19,188
"I had a friend named rambling Bob"

336
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:22,383
"He use to steal, gamble and rob"

337
00:27:22,629 --> 00:27:26,382
"He thought he was
the smartest guy around"

338
00:27:28,946 --> 00:27:30,265
"Well, I found out"

339
00:27:30,346 --> 00:27:34,417
We're leaving the state,
pursuing opportunities in another venue.

340
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:36,012
I've got big plans.

341
00:27:36,104 --> 00:27:39,618
Not minstrelsy. This here's just a dodge.
I'm gonna be a dentist.

342
00:27:39,862 --> 00:27:42,295
I know this guy
who will print me up a license.

343
00:27:44,061 --> 00:27:46,369
"He's in the jailhouse now"

344
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:50,451
"Well, I told him once or twice"

345
00:27:51,218 --> 00:27:54,572
"Stop playing cards and shooting dice"

346
00:27:55,217 --> 00:27:57,604
"He's in the jailhouse now"

347
00:28:17,688 --> 00:28:20,043
"Bob liked to play his poker"

348
00:28:22,007 --> 00:28:24,236
Well, that is an improper suggestion.

349
00:28:24,806 --> 00:28:28,513
I can't switch sides
in the middle of a campaign.

350
00:28:29,324 --> 00:28:32,997
Especially to work for a man
who lacks moral fiber.

351
00:28:33,083 --> 00:28:36,358
Moral fiber!
You pasty-faced son of a bitch.

352
00:28:36,441 --> 00:28:37,874
I invented moral fiber.

353
00:28:37,961 --> 00:28:41,508
Pappy O'Daniel was displaying rectitude
and high-mindedness while that...

354
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:44,396
...egghead you work for
was still messin' his drawers.

355
00:28:45,918 --> 00:28:47,033
Go away.

356
00:28:47,118 --> 00:28:49,425
I wanna be
what you want me to be, honey.

357
00:28:49,516 --> 00:28:51,905
I want you and the gals to come with me.

358
00:28:53,275 --> 00:28:56,710
"Started playing cards and shooting dice"

359
00:28:57,994 --> 00:29:00,029
What you doing here, Pappy?

360
00:29:00,593 --> 00:29:02,946
I guess someone let on
we was giving out liquor.

361
00:29:03,031 --> 00:29:05,783
You'll be laughing out the other side
of your face come November.

362
00:29:05,871 --> 00:29:09,782
Pappy O'Daniel will be laughing then.
- Not out the other side of his face, though.

363
00:29:09,869 --> 00:29:11,746
No. Just the regular side.

364
00:29:24,583 --> 00:29:26,574
They're my daughters too, Penny.

365
00:29:27,303 --> 00:29:28,530
Ain't you ever heard--

366
00:29:28,622 --> 00:29:30,771
"In constant sorrow"

367
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:34,255
"All through his days"

368
00:29:47,575 --> 00:29:52,852
"I'm a man of constant sorrow"

369
00:29:54,572 --> 00:29:57,927
"I've seen trouble all my days"

370
00:29:58,012 --> 00:30:00,205
It's the Soggy Bottom Boys!

371
00:30:00,331 --> 00:30:05,960
"I bid farewell to old Kentucky"

372
00:30:07,128 --> 00:30:11,006
"The place where I was born and raised"

373
00:30:12,126 --> 00:30:16,277
"The place where he was born and raised"

374
00:30:37,477 --> 00:30:39,910
Holy Moly! These boys are a hit.

375
00:30:40,196 --> 00:30:42,425
But, Pappy, they are integrated.

376
00:30:43,075 --> 00:30:44,666
Wait a minute.

377
00:30:45,354 --> 00:30:47,821
Well, I guess folks don't mind integration.

378
00:30:47,992 --> 00:30:51,348
You're miscegenated.
All you boys is miscegenated.

379
00:30:52,071 --> 00:30:53,743
Give me a microphone.

380
00:30:56,189 --> 00:30:58,225
These boys is not white.

381
00:30:58,589 --> 00:31:01,864
These boys is not white.
Hell, they ain't even old-timey.

382
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:04,463
I happen to know, ladies and gentlemen...

383
00:31:04,546 --> 00:31:07,504
...that this band of miscreants here,
this very evening...

384
00:31:07,706 --> 00:31:11,219
...interfered with a lynch mob,
in the performance of its duties.

385
00:31:12,903 --> 00:31:14,336
It's true.

386
00:31:14,423 --> 00:31:19,415
See, I belong to a certain secret society,
I don't believe I got to mention its name.

387
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,894
Let 'em play, I wanna hear them sing.

388
00:31:24,259 --> 00:31:25,817
And these boys here...

389
00:31:25,938 --> 00:31:29,373
...they trampled all over
our venerated observances and rituals.

390
00:31:29,457 --> 00:31:32,209
Now, this here music is over.

391
00:31:37,495 --> 00:31:39,052
Listen to me.

392
00:31:39,653 --> 00:31:43,009
These boys desecrated a fiery cross.

393
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:50,044
And they're convicts, folks.
Fugitives escaped off the farm.

394
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:53,804
Now, folks, these boys have
got to be remanded to the authorities.

395
00:31:54,248 --> 00:31:57,842
Criminals! And I have it
from the highest authority...

396
00:31:57,927 --> 00:32:01,521
...that Negra sold his soul to the Devil.

397
00:32:03,125 --> 00:32:05,513
Now wait a minute, folks. It's true.

398
00:32:10,282 --> 00:32:12,750
Is you is, oris you ain't my constituency?

399
00:32:13,961 --> 00:32:16,758
Is you is, oris you ain't my constituency?

400
00:32:20,479 --> 00:32:21,957
Is you is--

401
00:32:22,718 --> 00:32:26,026
Is you is or is you ain't my constituency?

402
00:32:28,636 --> 00:32:29,909
No! It's over now.

403
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:46,542
This is not necessary. Come on.

404
00:32:59,624 --> 00:33:05,970
"It's fare thee well, my own true lover"

405
00:33:06,581 --> 00:33:10,778
"I never expect to see you again"

406
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:18,853
"For I'm bound to ride
that northern railroad"

407
00:33:20,056 --> 00:33:24,411
"Perhaps I'll die upon that train"

408
00:33:25,614 --> 00:33:29,845
"Perhaps he'll die upon that train"

409
00:33:30,613 --> 00:33:32,921
Goddamn! Opportunity knocks.

410
00:33:34,291 --> 00:33:35,690
Get out of my way!

411
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:39,003
"I'm just a stranger"

412
00:33:39,369 --> 00:33:43,566
"A face you'll never see no more"

413
00:33:45,647 --> 00:33:52,244
"But there is one promise thatis given"

414
00:33:52,725 --> 00:33:57,035
"I'll meet you on God's golden shore"

415
00:33:58,123 --> 00:34:02,592
"He'll meet you on God's golden shore"

416
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:05,396
That's fine.

417
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:11,988
Ladies and gentleman...

418
00:34:12,477 --> 00:34:14,467
...here and listenin' at home.

419
00:34:15,116 --> 00:34:17,185
The great state of Mississippi...

420
00:34:18,235 --> 00:34:20,111
...Pappy O'Daniel, Governor...

421
00:34:20,274 --> 00:34:24,505
...wants to thank the Soggy Bottom Boys
for that wonderful performance.

422
00:34:29,071 --> 00:34:32,540
Now, it looks like
the only man in this great state...

423
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:34,187
...who ain't a music lover...

424
00:34:34,269 --> 00:34:38,420
...is my esteemed opponent
in the upcomin', Homer Stokes.

425
00:34:38,947 --> 00:34:41,858
Well, there ain't no accounting for taste.

426
00:34:41,946 --> 00:34:46,860
Its ounded to me like he was harborin'
a grudge against the Soggy Bottom Boys...

427
00:34:46,984 --> 00:34:49,497
...on account of their rough
and rowdy past.

428
00:34:51,543 --> 00:34:56,376
Looks like Homer Stokes is the kind of fella
who wants to cast the first stone.

429
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:01,573
Well, I'm with you folks,
I'm a forgive-and-forget Christian.

430
00:35:02,338 --> 00:35:03,487
And I say:

431
00:35:03,618 --> 00:35:07,974
If their rambunctiousness
and misdemeanoring is behind them....

432
00:35:08,656 --> 00:35:10,168
It is, ain't it, boys?

433
00:35:11,096 --> 00:35:12,164
Yes, sir, it is.

434
00:35:12,255 --> 00:35:16,167
Well, I say, by the power vested in me...

435
00:35:16,374 --> 00:35:19,205
...these boys is hereby pardoned.

436
00:35:23,491 --> 00:35:24,639
Furthermore...

437
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:28,408
...in the second
Pappy O'Daniel administration...

438
00:35:28,649 --> 00:35:31,924
...these boys is gonna be my brain trust.

439
00:35:36,686 --> 00:35:38,562
What does that mean, Everett?

440
00:35:38,925 --> 00:35:42,633
Delmar, it means you and me and Pete
and Tommy are gonna be the...

441
00:35:42,804 --> 00:35:45,192
...power behind the throne, so to speak.

442
00:35:45,603 --> 00:35:46,955
Okay.

443
00:35:47,322 --> 00:35:51,359
So without further ado,
and by way of endorsin' my candidacy...

444
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:56,078
...the Soggy Bottom Boys
is gonna lead us all in a chorus of:

445
00:35:56,159 --> 00:35:58,149
You Are My Sunshine.

446
00:35:59,078 --> 00:36:00,556
Ain't ya, boys?

447
00:36:01,556 --> 00:36:03,308
Governor, it's one of our favorites.

448
00:36:03,397 --> 00:36:06,432
Son, you're gonna go far.

449
00:36:07,634 --> 00:36:11,989
"You are my sunshine, my only sunshine"

450
00:36:12,752 --> 00:36:17,063
"You make me happy when skies are gray"

451
00:36:17,911 --> 00:36:22,346
"You'll never know, dear
how much I love you"

452
00:36:23,188 --> 00:36:27,465
"Please don't take my sunshine away"

453
00:36:31,426 --> 00:36:34,575
I guess Vernon T. Waldrip
is gonna be goin' on relief.

454
00:36:35,344 --> 00:36:37,983
Maybe I can throw
a little patronage his way.

455
00:36:38,183 --> 00:36:41,140
Get him a job diggin' ditches
or roundin' up stray dogs.

456
00:36:41,222 --> 00:36:43,655
So is the marriage off then, Miss Wharvey?

457
00:36:43,741 --> 00:36:47,049
McGill. No, the marriage will take place
as planned.

458
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,530
Little change of cast.

459
00:36:49,619 --> 00:36:52,178
Me and the little lady
are gonna pick up the pieces...

460
00:36:52,258 --> 00:36:54,851
...and retie the knot,
metaphorically speaking.

461
00:36:55,057 --> 00:36:57,012
You boys are invited of course.

462
00:36:57,496 --> 00:36:59,134
Hell, you're the best men.

463
00:36:59,215 --> 00:37:00,773
Already got the rings.

464
00:37:01,895 --> 00:37:05,522
Where's your ring, honey?
- I ain't worn it since our divorce.

465
00:37:05,613 --> 00:37:09,127
Must be in the roll-top in our old cabin.
Never thought I'd need it.

466
00:37:09,211 --> 00:37:11,645
Vernon bought one, encrusted with jewels.

467
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:14,237
Now's the time to buy it off him, cheap.

468
00:37:15,329 --> 00:37:18,286
We ain't getting married with his ring.
You said you'd changed.

469
00:37:18,368 --> 00:37:21,518
Yours is just an old pewter thing.
- There ain't gonna be no weddin'.

470
00:37:21,607 --> 00:37:23,358
It's just a symbol.
- No weddin'.

471
00:37:23,446 --> 00:37:25,164
We'll go fetch it with ya, Everett.

472
00:37:25,245 --> 00:37:28,078
Shut up, Delmar. It's just a symbol....

473
00:37:28,165 --> 00:37:30,598
I've spoken my piece and counted to three.

474
00:37:31,843 --> 00:37:33,355
She counted to three.

475
00:37:33,882 --> 00:37:38,352
Goddamn it.
She counted to three. Son of a bitch!

476
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,995
You have any idea how far that cabin is?

477
00:37:57,354 --> 00:37:58,309
George?

478
00:37:58,793 --> 00:38:04,741
Hello. Well, these men finally caught up
with the criminal of the century.

479
00:38:04,831 --> 00:38:07,139
Looks like the chair for George Nelson.

480
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:12,499
Gonna electrify me.
I'm gonna go off like a Roman candle!

481
00:38:13,428 --> 00:38:16,897
20,000 volts chasing a rabbit
through yours truly.

482
00:38:16,987 --> 00:38:20,456
Goddamn, I'm gonna suck all the power
right out of the state.

483
00:38:20,785 --> 00:38:23,253
Gonna shoot sparks
outta the top of my head...

484
00:38:23,344 --> 00:38:25,380
...and lightnin' from my fingertips.

485
00:38:25,503 --> 00:38:29,700
I'm George Nelson,
and I'm feelin' 10 feet tall!

486
00:38:29,822 --> 00:38:32,857
Looks like George
is right back on top again.

487
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,091
Cow-killer!

488
00:38:48,055 --> 00:38:51,808
Well, at least you boys
get to see the ancestral manse.

489
00:38:52,614 --> 00:38:56,890
The home where I spent many happy days
in the bosom of my family.

490
00:38:56,972 --> 00:38:58,610
Refugium, if you will.

491
00:38:58,731 --> 00:39:03,008
With a mighty oak tree out front
and a happy little tire swing.

492
00:39:08,128 --> 00:39:10,277
Where's the happy little tire swing?

493
00:39:13,286 --> 00:39:15,037
End of the road, boys.

494
00:39:16,685 --> 00:39:18,083
Now wait a minute.

495
00:39:18,284 --> 00:39:22,833
It's had its twists and turns.
Now it deposits you here.

496
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:24,471
Now wait a minute.

497
00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:29,429
You have eluded fate
and you have eluded me for the last time.

498
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,752
Tie their hands, boys.

499
00:39:31,879 --> 00:39:33,232
You can't do this, now.

500
00:39:33,318 --> 00:39:35,626
Didn't know you'd be bringin' a friend.

501
00:39:36,157 --> 00:39:38,227
He'll just have to wait his turn.

502
00:39:38,557 --> 00:39:40,114
Share one of your graves.

503
00:39:40,196 --> 00:39:43,585
You can't do this, we just got pardoned
by the Governor himself.

504
00:39:43,675 --> 00:39:45,551
It went out on the radio.

505
00:39:46,714 --> 00:39:48,112
Is that right?

506
00:39:50,473 --> 00:39:52,508
Well, we ain't got a radio.

507
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:56,988
God have mercy.

508
00:40:01,948 --> 00:40:09,579
"You got to go to the lonesome valley"

509
00:40:19,861 --> 00:40:21,260
It ain't fittin'.

510
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:24,207
It ain't the law.
- The law?

511
00:40:26,139 --> 00:40:29,095
The law is a human institution.

512
00:40:29,298 --> 00:40:36,008
"Nobody else can go there for you"

513
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:39,653
Perhaps you should start
making your prayers.

514
00:40:52,449 --> 00:40:54,484
Oh, my God, Everett.

515
00:40:56,408 --> 00:40:59,285
Tommy, I'm sorry we got you into this.

516
00:40:59,647 --> 00:41:00,840
Good Lord...

517
00:41:02,286 --> 00:41:04,037
...what do we do?

518
00:41:13,841 --> 00:41:14,830
Lord...

519
00:41:16,241 --> 00:41:19,436
...please look down
and recognize us poor sinners.

520
00:41:22,518 --> 00:41:26,192
Please Lord,
I just want to see my daughters again.

521
00:41:28,595 --> 00:41:31,234
I've been separated from my family
for so long.

522
00:41:32,755 --> 00:41:35,631
I know I've been guilty
of pride and sharp dealin'.

523
00:41:35,953 --> 00:41:38,262
I'm sorry that I turned my back on you.

524
00:41:39,392 --> 00:41:43,065
Forgive me, and help us, Lord.

525
00:41:44,629 --> 00:41:46,143
For the sake of my family.

526
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:47,821
For Tommy's sake.

527
00:41:48,148 --> 00:41:49,740
For Delmar's and Pete's.

528
00:41:53,226 --> 00:41:55,262
Let me see my daughters again.

529
00:41:57,386 --> 00:41:59,739
Help us, please.

530
00:44:09,617 --> 00:44:12,254
A miracle! It was a miracle!

531
00:44:12,335 --> 00:44:15,485
Don't be ignorant. I told you
they were going to flood this valley.

532
00:44:15,574 --> 00:44:18,804
No, that ain't it.
- We prayed to God and he pitied us.

533
00:44:18,893 --> 00:44:20,485
Well, it never fails.

534
00:44:20,573 --> 00:44:23,927
Once again you two hayseeds are showin'
how much you want for intellect.

535
00:44:24,011 --> 00:44:27,207
There's a perfectly scientific explanation
for what just happened.

536
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:30,281
That ain't the tune you was singing
back there at the gallows.

537
00:44:30,368 --> 00:44:33,598
Well, any human being
will cast about in a moment of stress.

538
00:44:34,768 --> 00:44:38,917
The fact is, they're flooding this valley
so they can hydro-electric the whole state.

539
00:44:39,005 --> 00:44:41,360
Yes, sir, the South is going to change.

540
00:44:41,925 --> 00:44:45,233
Everything's gonna be put on electricity
and run on a payin' basis.

541
00:44:45,323 --> 00:44:49,474
Out with the old spiritual mumbo-jumbo,
the superstitions and backward ways.

542
00:44:49,562 --> 00:44:51,597
We'll see a brave new world where they...

543
00:44:51,681 --> 00:44:54,592
...run everybody a wire
and hook us up to a grid.

544
00:44:54,759 --> 00:44:56,875
Yes, sir, a veritable age of reason...

545
00:44:56,999 --> 00:45:00,353
...like the one they had in France,
and not a moment too soon.

546
00:45:05,676 --> 00:45:07,711
Not a moment too soon.

547
00:45:09,554 --> 00:45:11,032
Hey, there's Tommy.

548
00:45:11,394 --> 00:45:13,270
Tommy, what you riding there?

549
00:45:17,072 --> 00:45:18,390
Roll-top desk.

550
00:45:27,547 --> 00:45:30,060
"All's well that ends well"
so the poet says.

551
00:45:30,146 --> 00:45:31,465
That's right, honey.

552
00:45:31,546 --> 00:45:34,343
I don't mind telling you
that I'm awful pleased...

553
00:45:34,425 --> 00:45:37,063
...my adventuring days
have come to an end.

554
00:45:37,224 --> 00:45:39,691
Time for this old boy to enjoy some repose.

555
00:45:40,023 --> 00:45:41,296
That's good, honey.

556
00:45:41,382 --> 00:45:43,498
You were right about that ring, too.

557
00:45:43,742 --> 00:45:46,494
Any other wedding band wouldn't do.

558
00:45:47,021 --> 00:45:48,772
This here was foreordained.

559
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:51,817
Fate was smilin' on me
and you just have to have confidence--

560
00:45:52,298 --> 00:45:53,492
That's not my ring.

561
00:45:53,938 --> 00:45:56,132
Not your ring?
- That's one of Aunt Hurlene's.

562
00:45:56,217 --> 00:45:59,173
You said it was in the roll-top desk.
- I said I thought so.

563
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:01,052
No, you said--
- Or under the mattress...

564
00:46:01,135 --> 00:46:04,809
...or in my chiffonier. I don't know.

565
00:46:04,894 --> 00:46:07,851
Well, I'm sorry, honey.
- We need that ring.

566
00:46:08,052 --> 00:46:11,521
Well, that ring is at the bottom
of a pretty darn big lake.

567
00:46:12,011 --> 00:46:14,649
A 9,000 hectare lake.
- I don't care if it's 90,000.

568
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:17,084
That lake was not my doin'.
- Well, of course not--

569
00:46:17,169 --> 00:46:19,318
I counted to three.
- Honey....

570
00:46:20,128 --> 00:46:22,880
Findin' one little ring
in the middle of all that water...

571
00:46:22,967 --> 00:46:25,560
...is one hell of a heroic task.

572
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:36,560
