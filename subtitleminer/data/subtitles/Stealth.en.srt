1
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:15,133
Talon 1 requesting Bitching Betty
relay Combat Control commands.

2
00:02:15,296 --> 00:02:16,649
Roger, Talon 1.

3
00:02:16,816 --> 00:02:18,215
Central Prime is transmitting...

4
00:02:18,376 --> 00:02:20,651
... encrypted satellite
auto-terrain comparison.

5
00:02:20,816 --> 00:02:22,454
Talons, this is Operator.

6
00:02:22,616 --> 00:02:24,811
PAYCOM has given
his final tasking orders.

7
00:02:25,296 --> 00:02:29,130
You are to proceed to target
and prosecute with precision.

8
00:02:29,296 --> 00:02:31,685
Now, remember,
you are pilots of the U.S. Navy.

9
00:02:31,856 --> 00:02:34,893
l expect nothing less
than perfection.

10
00:02:35,256 --> 00:02:37,645
Roger, skipper.
Activating tactical music.

11
00:02:37,816 --> 00:02:40,569
Countermeasure is silent party.
Talon 2, confirm.

12
00:02:40,896 --> 00:02:42,409
Talon 2 confirms. Music on.

13
00:02:42,576 --> 00:02:44,646
Risk assessment is
we have a clean mission status.

14
00:02:44,816 --> 00:02:46,215
Attack commencing.

15
00:02:57,696 --> 00:02:59,049
Gotcha.

16
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:12,407
Missile lock. Missile lock.

17
00:03:12,696 --> 00:03:16,006
Talon 3, there's a SAM site on
the west wall. We got birds in the air.

18
00:03:29,136 --> 00:03:31,047
Talon 2,
the SAM site's been erased.

19
00:03:31,216 --> 00:03:33,207
Now, that's how you do it.

20
00:03:57,216 --> 00:03:58,695
Talon 3, that was shit-hot!

21
00:03:59,136 --> 00:04:01,570
Talon 1 , l expect
the same out of you.

22
00:04:16,776 --> 00:04:19,813
Arming Blue Ferret
for penetration detonation.

23
00:04:21,456 --> 00:04:23,174
Missile armed. Missile armed.

24
00:04:59,856 --> 00:05:02,416
Yep, 1 00 over 1 00.
That's correct.

25
00:05:02,816 --> 00:05:04,568
And l can rely on these numbers?

26
00:05:04,736 --> 00:05:09,093
Well, this isn't figure skating, Ray.
You either score or you don't.

27
00:05:09,256 --> 00:05:11,133
National Command Authority's
duly impressed.

28
00:05:11,296 --> 00:05:13,287
They've given us the go-ahead
on phase two.

29
00:05:13,456 --> 00:05:14,650
You know what?

30
00:05:14,816 --> 00:05:18,252
You should come to D.C. and make
the presentation to the senators.

31
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:20,966
That's how Admiral Rickover
got things done.

32
00:05:21,136 --> 00:05:23,047
Admiral. You get my meaning?

33
00:05:23,216 --> 00:05:25,969
No, l'm flattered,
but you do the lobbying.

34
00:05:26,136 --> 00:05:27,694
Politics is for politicians.

35
00:05:28,816 --> 00:05:31,535
-Captain?
-l'll get back to you.

36
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:33,929
There's Popsicles in the cooler.

37
00:05:34,096 --> 00:05:35,529
-Got any grape?
-Any grape?

38
00:05:36,816 --> 00:05:39,774
l believe there is one left,
and don't lose your dignity.

39
00:05:39,936 --> 00:05:41,210
Oh, thank you.

40
00:05:42,096 --> 00:05:44,564
-All right, take a seat.
-Nice catch.

41
00:05:44,736 --> 00:05:48,126
Talk to me. Where are the holes?
How can we improve?

42
00:05:48,296 --> 00:05:50,093
Come on. l'm not a patient man.

43
00:05:50,256 --> 00:05:52,975
Sorry, l got caught up on
that west wall. l had to pull out--

44
00:05:53,136 --> 00:05:55,366
War is a team sport.

45
00:05:55,536 --> 00:05:58,733
Those AAA sites were thick.
Gave extra time to the SAM sites.

46
00:05:58,896 --> 00:06:01,774
See, that's your answer. There really
was no room for improvement.

47
00:06:01,936 --> 00:06:04,166
Actually, what Lieutenant Wade
did was right.

48
00:06:04,336 --> 00:06:07,089
She took out their communications
and exposed their SAM sites...

49
00:06:07,256 --> 00:06:09,372
-...so Henry could lay it down.
-That's what l do.

50
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:12,175
-l mean, it was perfect.
-'' Perfect.'' l'll go along with that.

51
00:06:12,336 --> 00:06:15,965
Much as l hate to see that smile
of yours get any smugger.

52
00:06:16,456 --> 00:06:17,730
You blushing?

53
00:06:19,216 --> 00:06:20,649
l've got good news.

54
00:06:20,816 --> 00:06:22,966
Tell us we got a carrier,
skipper, come on.

55
00:06:23,136 --> 00:06:24,171
Affirmative.

56
00:06:24,336 --> 00:06:26,054
The USS Abraham Lincoln.

57
00:06:26,656 --> 00:06:28,965
Captain's an old classmate of mine,
Dick Marshfield.

58
00:06:29,136 --> 00:06:32,333
-l believe you two know each other.
-He was the captain l told you about.

59
00:06:32,496 --> 00:06:35,852
-Hell of a pilot in his day.
-He's black too. He's black.

60
00:06:36,016 --> 00:06:38,689
l'm also gonna be expanding
your squadron.

61
00:06:39,576 --> 00:06:42,044
On the carrier, you'll be joined
by a new wingman.

62
00:06:42,896 --> 00:06:44,887
A fourth wingman?

63
00:06:45,056 --> 00:06:48,366
Wait, l thought there were only
three Talons in existence.

64
00:06:48,536 --> 00:06:51,846
What is the problem, Purcell?
You look like you been hit in the gut.

65
00:06:52,016 --> 00:06:55,213
For one, captain, we've been flying
together for a long time and it's good.

66
00:06:55,376 --> 00:06:56,650
And four is an unlucky number.

67
00:06:58,256 --> 00:06:59,735
-Unlucky?
-lt's not a prime number.

68
00:06:59,896 --> 00:07:02,205
Prime numbers can only be divided
by one or itself.

69
00:07:02,376 --> 00:07:03,809
Three is prime. The Holy Trinity.

70
00:07:03,976 --> 00:07:06,536
Thesis and antithesis come together
and form the synthesis--

71
00:07:06,696 --> 00:07:10,325
This is not a seminar on metaphysics.
This is the U.S. Navy.

72
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:15,047
Now, we ship out Wednesday at 0500.
Dismissed.

73
00:07:15,216 --> 00:07:17,446
Okay. lf he'd let me finish,
l was gonna say...

74
00:07:17,616 --> 00:07:21,291
... Three's Company, Three Stooges,
Three Musketeers, three-peat...

75
00:07:21,456 --> 00:07:23,686
...''three strikes, you're out,''
''Three Times a Lady.''

76
00:07:23,856 --> 00:07:25,369
-Three dimensions.
-Three blind mice.

77
00:07:25,536 --> 00:07:28,096
There's ménage à trois.
Don't forget that one.

78
00:07:30,736 --> 00:07:32,169
To the original three.

79
00:07:32,336 --> 00:07:33,928
-Cheers to that.
-Cheers.

80
00:07:34,096 --> 00:07:36,291
-Cheers.
-And assorted guests.

81
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,571
Cheers.

82
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:56,532
l'll be back in a second.

83
00:07:57,936 --> 00:08:00,006
l gotta go pee-pee.

84
00:08:00,976 --> 00:08:02,091
That's nasty.

85
00:08:06,856 --> 00:08:08,926
At least she's potty-trained.
l'll give her that.

86
00:08:10,096 --> 00:08:11,529
-Chip O'Dell.
-No way.

87
00:08:11,696 --> 00:08:14,813
Yeah, it's gotta be him. Hey, Henry,
our fourth wing. lt's gotta be him.

88
00:08:14,976 --> 00:08:17,934
He tried to manipulate his way into
the program, but you two beat him.

89
00:08:18,096 --> 00:08:21,486
Yeah, but Becky Martinez
could fly circles around O'Dell.

90
00:08:21,656 --> 00:08:24,375
-Two out of the four are women? No.
-Hey, you never know.

91
00:08:24,536 --> 00:08:27,687
-God, you're such a chauvinist.
-Hold on, now, that's not true.

92
00:08:27,856 --> 00:08:32,008
l bow down before the superiority
of the opposite sex in many respects.

93
00:08:32,176 --> 00:08:33,404
But from time to time...

94
00:08:33,656 --> 00:08:35,533
...l believe they should
bow down before me.

95
00:08:35,696 --> 00:08:38,847
-Oh, please.
-Kara. Kara, listen. You're different.

96
00:08:39,016 --> 00:08:41,007
-You are a singularity.
-Absolutely.

97
00:08:41,176 --> 00:08:42,894
You're a freak. Of nature.

98
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:45,934
-Well, thank you, Henry, l think.
-You are very welcome.

99
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:48,247
You know what l think?

100
00:08:49,136 --> 00:08:51,570
Don't think. Drink.

101
00:09:34,656 --> 00:09:36,135
Have fun.

102
00:10:58,296 --> 00:11:00,491
Spectacular night, huh?

103
00:11:00,976 --> 00:11:04,491
-Dark and mysterious, sir.
-Don't you like surprises, Ben?

104
00:11:09,616 --> 00:11:11,208
Well, here he comes now.

105
00:11:34,136 --> 00:11:36,525
Meet your new wingman.

106
00:11:48,896 --> 00:11:52,332
Allow me to introduce the future
of digital warfare. Tim?

107
00:11:55,816 --> 00:11:58,171
Open for Tim, please.

108
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:06,893
Fuel, catalyzed A1 methane.

109
00:12:07,056 --> 00:12:09,616
Exoskeleton,
metal-ceramic composite.

110
00:12:09,776 --> 00:12:11,926
Aeroelastic wings.

111
00:12:12,096 --> 00:12:16,533
Pulse detonation engine
with twin hybrid scramjet turbos.

112
00:12:16,696 --> 00:12:20,166
EDl's sensors can pick out
a face five miles away.

113
00:12:20,336 --> 00:12:24,011
So we'll take three. Drop the top
on mine, personalized license plate.

114
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:26,246
So this is one of these
smart UCAVs.

115
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:29,613
Well, technically you could call it
an Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicle.

116
00:12:29,776 --> 00:12:32,051
But that would be like
calling this carrier a rowboat.

117
00:12:32,216 --> 00:12:34,252
l feel you, captain.
l know a bit about this.

118
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:37,772
-This is quantum processing, right?
-Yeah, it's the first tested application.

119
00:12:37,936 --> 00:12:39,210
Ten terabits a second.

120
00:12:39,376 --> 00:12:41,810
So if it's a UCAV,
why does it have a seat?

121
00:12:41,976 --> 00:12:44,012
The cockpit's just
for testing and maintenance.

122
00:12:44,176 --> 00:12:46,246
Otherwise, EDl flies all by himself.

123
00:12:46,736 --> 00:12:48,886
You mean '' itself,'' don't you, sir?

124
00:12:49,056 --> 00:12:52,844
So this is what the fuss is all about.

125
00:12:53,816 --> 00:12:56,330
You're looking
at VLO stealth, captain.

126
00:12:56,496 --> 00:12:58,373
lt's got a brain
like a quantum sponge.

127
00:12:58,536 --> 00:13:02,165
And one day, its survivability
is going to fly right off the charts.

128
00:13:02,336 --> 00:13:04,645
-Lieutenant Wade.
-lt's good to meet you, sir.

129
00:13:05,456 --> 00:13:07,924
lt is a bag of chips, all right.

130
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:12,011
-Lieutenant Purcell.
-Honoured to meet you, sir.

131
00:13:12,176 --> 00:13:14,212
lt will replace us all.

132
00:13:14,736 --> 00:13:17,455
Looks and sounds
like science fiction, George.

133
00:13:17,616 --> 00:13:19,607
Well, so did everything,
once upon a time.

134
00:13:19,776 --> 00:13:21,607
Ain't that the truth.

135
00:13:21,976 --> 00:13:23,932
Mr. Gannon.
Good to have you back.

136
00:13:24,576 --> 00:13:28,171
Your first squadron tour still holds
some of the ship's most...

137
00:13:28,336 --> 00:13:29,928
...impressive records.

138
00:13:30,096 --> 00:13:32,815
Thank you, Captain Marshfield.
Records are made to be broken.

139
00:13:32,976 --> 00:13:35,536
Rules too, if l remember
your philosophy.

140
00:13:35,696 --> 00:13:38,335
Captain Cummings,
this is my XO, Mr. Carlson.

141
00:13:38,496 --> 00:13:39,690
Carlson.

142
00:13:39,856 --> 00:13:42,689
Why don't you meet me up on
the flight deck after you're through.

143
00:13:42,856 --> 00:13:44,369
-You bet.
-Congratulations, George.

144
00:13:44,536 --> 00:13:46,731
Thank you.
Good to see you again, Dick.

145
00:13:46,896 --> 00:13:48,011
You too.

146
00:13:48,176 --> 00:13:50,770
-lt's humming.
-No, EDl's thinking.

147
00:13:50,936 --> 00:13:54,246
-Thinking? Thinking about what, sir?
-You. All of you.

148
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,965
He's going over your files.
He's reviewing all your flight logs.

149
00:13:58,136 --> 00:14:00,047
Let's take it for a spin,
see what it can do.

150
00:14:00,216 --> 00:14:01,934
No, no, no. Tomorrow.

151
00:14:02,096 --> 00:14:04,769
-First, you gotta do your homework.
-Homework?

152
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:09,771
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

153
00:14:11,056 --> 00:14:14,526
'' EDl UCAV. Extreme Deep lnvader.''

154
00:14:14,856 --> 00:14:16,847
Yeah, l've been called that
a few times.

155
00:14:17,016 --> 00:14:18,529
-l've heard that one.
-Yeah, right.

156
00:14:31,536 --> 00:14:33,766
Well, hello, gorgeous.

157
00:14:55,216 --> 00:14:58,731
Please, no pictures, please.
No pictures, please. Please.

158
00:14:58,896 --> 00:15:02,252
Okay, take them.
Take them. Take them.

159
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:10,815
lt's open.

160
00:15:11,256 --> 00:15:12,974
Study break.

161
00:15:15,256 --> 00:15:17,565
You are one big study break.

162
00:15:17,736 --> 00:15:19,055
Just a natural.

163
00:15:19,976 --> 00:15:21,455
So that is the appeal.

164
00:15:21,616 --> 00:15:23,971
Okay, because l was really
wondering how you manage...

165
00:15:24,136 --> 00:15:26,604
...to pull a rocket scientist
at every port.

166
00:15:27,216 --> 00:15:30,845
You better be careful, Ben, you know.
Hair bleach causes cancer in rats.

167
00:15:31,016 --> 00:15:32,813
Well, l'm not a rat.
That's my appeal.

168
00:15:35,176 --> 00:15:37,451
-You checking out the drone?
-Yeah.

169
00:15:37,616 --> 00:15:39,846
Just barely skimmed the surface.

170
00:15:40,496 --> 00:15:43,568
-We really are in the era of EDl.
-EDl.

171
00:15:44,296 --> 00:15:46,764
Did l ever tell you
about that foster mother l had?

172
00:15:46,936 --> 00:15:49,894
-The one who weighed 350 pounds?
-No.

173
00:15:50,056 --> 00:15:53,810
Anyway, one day she comes home
with this Chihuahua, right?

174
00:15:53,976 --> 00:15:56,126
Guess what she named him. Eddie.

175
00:15:56,296 --> 00:15:59,368
-You know what l realized about you?
-What?

176
00:15:59,536 --> 00:16:01,766
You got a foster mom
for every situation.

177
00:16:01,936 --> 00:16:04,655
Hey, l lived through my childhood.
l may as well use it, right?

178
00:16:04,816 --> 00:16:06,329
That's right.

179
00:16:10,816 --> 00:16:13,011
So tell me, you think
Marshfield's right?

180
00:16:13,176 --> 00:16:15,644
You think they're gonna trade us all in
for that machine?

181
00:16:15,816 --> 00:16:19,445
No way. War is about tools.
Think about it.

182
00:16:19,616 --> 00:16:21,447
Claws to clubs, bronze to steel.

183
00:16:21,616 --> 00:16:24,494
-Best guy with the best weapon wins.
-Or girl.

184
00:16:24,656 --> 00:16:27,216
And we all know who that is,
don't we?

185
00:16:29,536 --> 00:16:33,449
The dull thud
of a Ben Gannon compliment.

186
00:16:41,576 --> 00:16:42,804
Well....

187
00:16:42,976 --> 00:16:45,285
Oh, pardon my C cup.

188
00:16:48,176 --> 00:16:50,292
Study break is over.

189
00:17:03,376 --> 00:17:05,056
Good morning to the crew
of the USS Abraham Lincoln.

190
00:17:05,056 --> 00:17:05,693
Good morning to the crew
of the USS Abraham Lincoln.

191
00:17:05,856 --> 00:17:08,165
Remember, foreign-object debris
can ruin a jet engine.

192
00:17:08,336 --> 00:17:10,896
Let's k eep our safety record.
Scour that deck.

193
00:17:11,056 --> 00:17:13,411
-Hey.
-Feel like we got older, Dick.

194
00:17:13,576 --> 00:17:14,895
What the hell happened?

195
00:17:15,056 --> 00:17:16,887
Don't complain.
You still got your hair.

196
00:17:17,056 --> 00:17:19,286
Yeah. Some of it.

197
00:17:21,176 --> 00:17:23,292
Look, truth be told...

198
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:28,489
...l never wanted this little experiment
of yours on my ship.

199
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:31,247
Well, you're not
hurting my feelings, Dick.

200
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:33,611
Admiral Spelling shared
your point paper with me...

201
00:17:33,776 --> 00:17:35,767
...and your objections
were duly noted.

202
00:17:35,936 --> 00:17:39,849
-You always could work the politics.
-lt's indispensable in a bureaucracy.

203
00:17:40,016 --> 00:17:42,655
This isn't a bureaucracy,
not out here.

204
00:17:42,816 --> 00:17:44,966
You rush a weapons system
into service...

205
00:17:45,136 --> 00:17:48,811
...you shortcut an operational
test cycle, people might get killed.

206
00:17:48,976 --> 00:17:52,651
You know l can't pick my nose here
without 7 000 people approving it.

207
00:17:52,816 --> 00:17:54,568
Nobody rushed a damn thing.

208
00:17:54,896 --> 00:17:57,251
Program is just ahead of schedule.

209
00:17:59,856 --> 00:18:01,608
You missed this.

210
00:18:05,176 --> 00:18:06,734
l'm out first, boys.

211
00:18:06,896 --> 00:18:08,648
l'm right on that ass.

212
00:18:09,576 --> 00:18:11,612
After you, ladies.

213
00:18:42,656 --> 00:18:44,294
Talon 2, airborne.

214
00:18:47,776 --> 00:18:50,336
Talon 3, airborne.

215
00:18:55,456 --> 00:18:58,175
Talon 1 is off and heading 2-5-4.

216
00:18:58,336 --> 00:19:00,327
Deploying Unmanned Combat
Aerial Vehicle...

217
00:19:00,496 --> 00:19:02,088
...Extreme Deep lnvader now.

218
00:19:13,056 --> 00:19:14,728
l never thought
we would see this day.

219
00:19:14,896 --> 00:19:16,409
Me neither, sir.

220
00:19:34,376 --> 00:19:36,571
UCAV EDl, you have launch.

221
00:20:07,296 --> 00:20:09,287
One to UCAV.
Confirm flight link. Over.

222
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:12,651
Flight link confirmed, Talon 1.

223
00:20:12,816 --> 00:20:15,376
It is good to be
part of the squadron.

224
00:20:15,536 --> 00:20:18,096
What? Well, well, well. He can talk.

225
00:20:18,256 --> 00:20:21,771
Big deal. l know a guy's BMW,
does exactly the same thing.

226
00:20:35,656 --> 00:20:36,805
Picture, please.

227
00:20:37,776 --> 00:20:39,494
Aye, aye, sir.

228
00:20:41,896 --> 00:20:43,488
Swarm logic activated.

229
00:20:44,656 --> 00:20:47,693
All right, Ben.
EDl's here to learn from you.

230
00:20:47,856 --> 00:20:50,973
So let's make sure these lessons
are up to speed, all right?

231
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:54,089
Well, then, let the schooling begin.

232
00:21:02,576 --> 00:21:04,328
Captain Cummings.

233
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,409
lnside, please.

234
00:21:10,816 --> 00:21:13,694
-What's the deal?
-You, sir, have a new tasking order.

235
00:21:17,936 --> 00:21:20,291
One to wing, anybody got a visual
on the UCAV?

236
00:21:22,496 --> 00:21:23,975
-Negative, 1 .
-Negative, 1 .

237
00:21:24,136 --> 00:21:25,569
We better find him and regroup.

238
00:21:25,736 --> 00:21:27,692
Before it takes a crap
in its quantum pants.

239
00:21:27,856 --> 00:21:29,050
Wait up. Hold on.

240
00:21:29,576 --> 00:21:31,248
What the hell is he doing?

241
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:33,691
Here he comes. Here he comes.

242
00:21:33,856 --> 00:21:36,495
l think little brother
is messing with us.

243
00:21:38,496 --> 00:21:41,772
UCAV, your position is always
on my starboard side.

244
00:21:41,936 --> 00:21:44,166
Other starboard.

245
00:21:54,056 --> 00:21:55,205
That's hot.

246
00:21:55,576 --> 00:21:58,932
Got no heart, but it sure can fly.
That's not bad for a tin man.

247
00:21:59,096 --> 00:22:03,806
EDl, it's official. You got a call sign.
UCAV ''Tin Man'' EDl, the first.

248
00:22:11,696 --> 00:22:13,766
-Operator to squadron.
-Go for Talons.

249
00:22:13,936 --> 00:22:16,006
There's been a change of plans.

250
00:22:16,176 --> 00:22:19,293
We're giving you an emergency
mission redirect. Repeat.

251
00:22:19,456 --> 00:22:21,651
That's an emergency redirect.
Do you read me?

252
00:22:21,816 --> 00:22:23,329
Roger. Where's the fire, skipper?

253
00:22:23,496 --> 00:22:26,488
PAYCOM has given us
a brand-new tasking order.

254
00:22:26,656 --> 00:22:28,408
Please access your encrypted file...

255
00:22:28,576 --> 00:22:31,568
...named ''Advanced
War Vector Scenarios.''

256
00:22:32,776 --> 00:22:34,095
File's open. Go ahead.

257
00:22:34,256 --> 00:22:37,931
All right. Firewall code
is ''Terror Summit.''

258
00:22:38,096 --> 00:22:42,567
We are upgrading this file from
a scenario to a tactical action plan.

259
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,374
Repeat, we are upgrading the file.

260
00:22:45,896 --> 00:22:49,935
ClA human intel has just learned
that the heads of three terrorist cells...

261
00:22:50,096 --> 00:22:53,054
...are about to meet in 24 minutes.

262
00:22:53,736 --> 00:22:56,808
The country is Myanmar.
The city is Rangoon.

263
00:22:56,976 --> 00:22:59,126
They're planning an imminent attack
on U.S. soil.

264
00:22:59,616 --> 00:23:01,607
One to Control,
what about the UCAV?

265
00:23:04,456 --> 00:23:06,651
EDl will observe your attack.

266
00:23:07,016 --> 00:23:08,972
Proceed to primary.

267
00:23:09,536 --> 00:23:11,174
Roger.

268
00:23:11,336 --> 00:23:15,249
One to UC AV,
confirm observation status only.

269
00:23:16,456 --> 00:23:19,289
Tin Man confirms, Talon 1.

270
00:23:20,496 --> 00:23:23,010
New coordinates
have been uploaded.

271
00:23:25,616 --> 00:23:27,652
Baptism by fire, Tin Man.

272
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:39,013
Mach 1.

273
00:23:40,016 --> 00:23:41,768
Mach 2.

274
00:23:42,736 --> 00:23:44,647
Mach 3.

275
00:23:45,336 --> 00:23:47,486
Mach 4.

276
00:23:51,056 --> 00:23:54,014
Primo's now analyzing the location.
Here we go.

277
00:23:55,496 --> 00:23:57,327
The primary is this building.

278
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:00,769
A new defense ministry
still under construction.

279
00:24:00,936 --> 00:24:05,214
Specs indicate
1 4-foot-thick cement roof...

280
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:07,446
...with steel reinforcements.

281
00:24:07,616 --> 00:24:09,846
Roger. We're not weaponized
for something that thick.

282
00:24:10,016 --> 00:24:11,449
Repeat, not weaponized.

283
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:14,050
This is 2. What's the population
of the collateral area?

284
00:24:16,416 --> 00:24:19,965
The building's unoccupied, but it's
in the middle of downtown Rangoon.

285
00:24:20,136 --> 00:24:21,888
This is 3.
Talk to me about that roof.

286
00:24:22,056 --> 00:24:24,092
What's Primo advocate
to ordinance and influence?

287
00:24:24,256 --> 00:24:26,008
Primo says Talons
can't penetrate it.

288
00:24:26,176 --> 00:24:29,885
This is our chance. We may never
catch these bastards together again.

289
00:24:30,056 --> 00:24:32,012
Try a lateral vector.

290
00:24:33,416 --> 00:24:35,611
Just do what he says.

291
00:24:37,296 --> 00:24:39,856
This is 2 to Control.
Risk assessment officer advises...

292
00:24:40,016 --> 00:24:42,246
...casualties from lateral vector
will be in the thousands.

293
00:25:15,296 --> 00:25:18,572
Tin Man has integrated
all network-centric spy satellites.

294
00:25:18,736 --> 00:25:20,010
Here is new data.

295
00:25:20,696 --> 00:25:24,848
UCAV is bypassing Central Prime.
He's distributing secure video stream.

296
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:59,372
Look at that. Oh, yeah. Oh, now
l know what l want for Christmas.

297
00:25:59,536 --> 00:26:01,606
One to Control, we've entered
our mission window.

298
00:26:01,776 --> 00:26:03,528
Six-three seconds
to primary and counting.

299
00:26:03,696 --> 00:26:05,448
Come on, Control,
we have our targets.

300
00:26:05,616 --> 00:26:09,768
Come on. l need an alternative.
We got these guys in the bull's-eye.

301
00:26:09,936 --> 00:26:12,609
There is an alternative,
Combat Control.

302
00:26:14,616 --> 00:26:17,335
Operator to UCAV. Talk to me.
Give me something.

303
00:26:17,936 --> 00:26:20,928
Squadron carries
truncheon implosion bombs.

304
00:26:21,696 --> 00:26:23,209
Negative, will not work.

305
00:26:23,376 --> 00:26:27,051
Central Prime says truncheons
can't achieve velocity for penetration.

306
00:26:27,216 --> 00:26:30,652
One to UCAV, 37 seconds to primary.
Come on, explain.

307
00:26:30,816 --> 00:26:34,729
Diving dead vertical at 20 7 0 knots
will increase truncheon velocity.

308
00:26:34,896 --> 00:26:37,046
Bomb will successfully
penetrate roof.

309
00:26:37,216 --> 00:26:39,332
What's the blackout risk
at vertical 207 0?

310
00:26:39,496 --> 00:26:42,966
-Seventy-three percent.
-Time on target is 23 seconds.

311
00:26:43,136 --> 00:26:46,333
-Call it off. lt's not worth the risk.
-Operator to Talons, pull back.

312
00:26:46,496 --> 00:26:48,248
-EDl will plant the truncheon.
-Captain.

313
00:26:48,416 --> 00:26:50,611
This is what we built
this machine for.

314
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:54,405
There's no blood in those
quantum veins. lt can't black out.

315
00:26:54,576 --> 00:26:58,728
Operator to Talons, repeat,
EDl will plant the truncheon.

316
00:26:58,896 --> 00:27:02,206
Control, negative, Control.
Mission critical. One will prosecute.

317
00:27:02,376 --> 00:27:03,855
This is 3 to 1 . l got your back...

318
00:27:04,016 --> 00:27:06,246
...but if you black out,
you're gonna kill everyone.

319
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:09,772
Negative, 3. l did not get this far
by being in the 7 3rd percentile.

320
00:27:10,216 --> 00:27:11,535
l like my odds.

321
00:27:11,696 --> 00:27:14,574
Talon 1, your orders
are to stand down.

322
00:27:14,736 --> 00:27:16,567
-Do you read me, lieutenant?
-I do--

323
00:27:18,896 --> 00:27:20,488
-Talon 1, stand down.
-l'm having--

324
00:27:20,656 --> 00:27:22,009
Can you--? Can you--?

325
00:27:26,496 --> 00:27:28,248
Go, baby, go.

326
00:28:13,536 --> 00:28:16,209
One hundred knots
to release velocity.

327
00:28:22,256 --> 00:28:23,769
Fifty knots to release velocity.

328
00:28:29,776 --> 00:28:31,289
His BP is spiking, sir.

329
00:28:34,256 --> 00:28:36,008
Release velocity attained.

330
00:28:36,176 --> 00:28:37,529
Truncheon away.

331
00:28:53,216 --> 00:28:55,969
Ten seconds to implosion.

332
00:28:56,136 --> 00:28:58,775
Nine, eight...

333
00:28:58,936 --> 00:29:01,325
...seven, six...

334
00:29:02,096 --> 00:29:06,294
... five, four, three...

335
00:29:06,456 --> 00:29:08,970
... two, one.

336
00:29:34,736 --> 00:29:38,570
This is 1 to Control. Looks like we
lost radio contact for a second there.

337
00:29:38,736 --> 00:29:41,967
There you go. l wasn't worried, baby.
l wasn't worried.

338
00:29:42,136 --> 00:29:45,412
Activating swarm logic,
going full-stealth egress.

339
00:29:45,776 --> 00:29:49,086
Roger, Talon 1 . Full-stealth egress.
Swarm logic is on.

340
00:29:49,536 --> 00:29:52,004
Battle damage assessment,
1 00 over 1 00.

341
00:29:52,176 --> 00:29:54,644
Collateral damage, zero.

342
00:30:07,896 --> 00:30:09,329
Let's go home.

343
00:30:10,096 --> 00:30:11,529
Going hypersonic.

344
00:30:15,976 --> 00:30:17,773
Same old Ben.

345
00:30:18,696 --> 00:30:20,015
Yep.

346
00:30:20,576 --> 00:30:22,214
Oh, and, George...

347
00:30:23,016 --> 00:30:24,972
...hell of a first mission.

348
00:30:25,136 --> 00:30:26,808
Thank you, captain.

349
00:30:29,136 --> 00:30:30,854
On my way to the bridge.

350
00:30:35,336 --> 00:30:37,213
Talon 2 and 3 are on deck.

351
00:30:37,376 --> 00:30:40,652
Talon 1 and UCAV EDl
are on approach.

352
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,850
Roger, Control. UCAV will go first.
l'll take the last trap.

353
00:30:44,016 --> 00:30:45,688
UCAV, confirm you've got the ball.

354
00:30:46,096 --> 00:30:49,133
Confirmed, Talon 1.
Tin Man will land next.

355
00:31:05,976 --> 00:31:08,774
Okay, 1 to Control,
we've had a lightning strike.

356
00:31:08,936 --> 00:31:10,767
The UCAV's very unstable.

357
00:31:10,936 --> 00:31:12,972
Landing sequence is altered.
l'll go in first...

358
00:31:13,136 --> 00:31:15,525
...but the UCAV
is gonna need the net.

359
00:31:27,576 --> 00:31:28,895
Nice landing, ma'am.

360
00:31:29,056 --> 00:31:32,492
On the flight deck,
stand by to rig barricade.

361
00:31:38,576 --> 00:31:42,046
Extreme Deep Invader aircraft
inbound for crash landing.

362
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:53,488
Pull it out! Pull it out! Pull it out!

363
00:31:53,656 --> 00:31:56,614
-Hold on! Stop! Stop.
-Stay low, stay low! Pull low!

364
00:32:02,896 --> 00:32:05,126
Pull starboard! Pull starboard!

365
00:32:19,616 --> 00:32:20,890
Clear the deck!

366
00:32:21,056 --> 00:32:23,047
Move it! Move it! Move it!

367
00:32:52,296 --> 00:32:55,368
-You scared me.
-Sorry, just a bit restless.

368
00:32:55,776 --> 00:32:59,451
Really got whacked tonight, right?
Like a hair dryer in a bathtub.

369
00:32:59,616 --> 00:33:02,005
Oh, he can't hear you.
l pulled his voice recog.

370
00:33:02,176 --> 00:33:06,089
l'll call it a '' he'' when it gets out of its
cockpit and takes a piss, how's that?

371
00:33:07,856 --> 00:33:10,006
-You all right?
-Yeah.

372
00:33:10,336 --> 00:33:13,726
lt's just a power surge, that's all.

373
00:33:13,896 --> 00:33:16,808
-And that's normal?
-Normal?

374
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:19,726
Let me show you something.

375
00:33:27,136 --> 00:33:29,696
That was EDl's neural network.

376
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:34,050
Now, check this out.

377
00:33:36,456 --> 00:33:40,495
l mean, ever since the lightning strike,
he's just been writing all of this....

378
00:33:40,656 --> 00:33:43,011
l don't know. A language or a code.

379
00:33:43,176 --> 00:33:45,132
And what does it mean?

380
00:33:45,496 --> 00:33:47,168
Yeah. '' Mean.''

381
00:33:47,336 --> 00:33:49,611
The person that could really
answer that question...

382
00:33:49,776 --> 00:33:52,165
-...is its designer, Keith Orbit.
-Orbit?

383
00:33:52,336 --> 00:33:55,533
-The guy's name is Orbit?
-Yeah, l know.

384
00:33:55,696 --> 00:33:58,893
He did all the Al on the Raptor
when he was 22...

385
00:33:59,056 --> 00:34:02,935
...and l guess, after that, he decided
that his given name was too earthly.

386
00:34:06,576 --> 00:34:08,931
Off for Tim, please.

387
00:34:09,096 --> 00:34:11,530
At least it's a good song.

388
00:34:12,816 --> 00:34:16,775
He downloads songs from the Web.

389
00:34:16,976 --> 00:34:18,489
Yeah? How many?

390
00:34:21,296 --> 00:34:23,287
All of them.

391
00:34:26,056 --> 00:34:28,889
You're in a peck of trouble
with the record companies there, son.

392
00:34:30,376 --> 00:34:31,855
Ben, could--?

393
00:34:36,816 --> 00:34:40,206
l saw how serious
that shit is up there.

394
00:34:40,376 --> 00:34:45,291
So l think it's only fair that l tell you
that EDl's been designed to evolve.

395
00:34:45,456 --> 00:34:49,051
-lt's just unpredictable--
-Let me ask you something.

396
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:54,609
Just between you and me,
do you have confidence in this plane?

397
00:34:57,416 --> 00:34:59,486
There's your answer.

398
00:35:02,416 --> 00:35:03,895
lt's open.

399
00:35:05,976 --> 00:35:07,375
Have a seat.

400
00:35:07,536 --> 00:35:10,494
''Waffle'' for 1 5 points.
l'm kicking your ass, buddy.

401
00:35:10,656 --> 00:35:12,374
You didn't cheat, did you?

402
00:35:12,536 --> 00:35:15,414
Cheating's not part
of my vocabulary.

403
00:35:15,936 --> 00:35:18,689
Listen, l scheduled your jet
for a little maintenance.

404
00:35:18,856 --> 00:35:21,928
l gotta get the bugs out of that radio,
don't you think?

405
00:35:22,096 --> 00:35:24,326
lt was a difficult situation
and l made a decision.

406
00:35:24,496 --> 00:35:26,009
You made a mistake, Ben.

407
00:35:26,176 --> 00:35:28,485
Sir, there's a thin line
between insubordination and--

408
00:35:28,656 --> 00:35:30,806
No, no, no,
that's not the mistake you made.

409
00:35:30,976 --> 00:35:33,934
Your mistake was getting competitive
with a machine.

410
00:35:34,096 --> 00:35:36,246
l'm the point of the sword
up there, sir.

411
00:35:36,416 --> 00:35:38,532
And l pulled it off, 1 00 over 1 00.

412
00:35:38,696 --> 00:35:42,450
Yes, indeedy, and l congratulate you.
Calls have been coming in all night.

413
00:35:42,616 --> 00:35:45,130
But that doesn't change the issue.

414
00:35:45,296 --> 00:35:46,490
What is the issue, then?

415
00:35:46,656 --> 00:35:48,487
-Would you like a cigar?
-Thank you, no.

416
00:35:48,656 --> 00:35:50,806
-You sure?
-Fine, thank you.

417
00:35:50,976 --> 00:35:53,206
Rolled on the thighs
of mulatto women.

418
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:58,694
What are you afraid of, Ben?

419
00:35:58,856 --> 00:36:01,051
Being replaced? ls that it?

420
00:36:01,216 --> 00:36:03,127
You afraid EDl's
gonna take your job?

421
00:36:03,296 --> 00:36:05,491
No. No, to be honest with you...

422
00:36:05,656 --> 00:36:09,251
...l just don't think war should become
some kind of video game.

423
00:36:10,536 --> 00:36:13,004
And how do you feel
about black body bags?

424
00:36:13,176 --> 00:36:15,815
What am l supposed to tell
all the weeping mothers?

425
00:36:15,976 --> 00:36:18,809
We could've got the job done
without sacrificing their children...

426
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:21,410
...but no, we decided not to
because of what?

427
00:36:21,576 --> 00:36:23,214
-Tradition?
-Not tradition, it's....

428
00:36:23,376 --> 00:36:26,254
Look, we have things
those computers can never have...

429
00:36:26,416 --> 00:36:29,169
...like instincts and feelings
and moral judgment.

430
00:36:29,336 --> 00:36:32,169
You can call me old-fashioned,
you can call it whatever you want...

431
00:36:32,336 --> 00:36:34,372
...but l just don't think that in war...

432
00:36:34,536 --> 00:36:37,687
...the action should ever be divorced
from the consequences.

433
00:36:37,856 --> 00:36:39,812
You don't think l consider
the consequences...

434
00:36:39,976 --> 00:36:42,570
...every time l send you up there
with bombs?

435
00:36:43,016 --> 00:36:45,132
-l know you do, sir.
-l've dedicated my life...

436
00:36:45,296 --> 00:36:46,809
...to considering the consequences.

437
00:36:48,776 --> 00:36:51,336
l got a bad feeling about this plane.

438
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:53,926
l don't know, l think it needs more....

439
00:36:54,096 --> 00:36:57,771
l don't know, trials before it's ever
put in a combat situation again.

440
00:36:57,936 --> 00:36:59,449
You been talking to Marshfield?

441
00:37:00,296 --> 00:37:03,686
-Sir, you're my commanding officer.
-That's right.

442
00:37:04,496 --> 00:37:08,375
And l guarantee you this thing will be
1 00 percent before l risk it in the field.

443
00:37:08,536 --> 00:37:10,413
Look, Ben...

444
00:37:10,576 --> 00:37:14,364
...all we need is
one more successful mission...

445
00:37:14,536 --> 00:37:17,448
...and this project will be out of
the stovepipe and into the light.

446
00:37:18,456 --> 00:37:20,174
Are you with me on this?

447
00:37:20,336 --> 00:37:23,248
-l'm here to make it happen, sir.
-All right.

448
00:37:23,416 --> 00:37:26,852
l've arranged a little R and R for you
and your team. You've earned it.

449
00:37:27,016 --> 00:37:28,165
Thailand maybe.

450
00:37:28,576 --> 00:37:30,328
We just got here.

451
00:37:31,096 --> 00:37:34,247
Yeah, but this could turn out
to be a long tour.

452
00:37:34,416 --> 00:37:39,331
You better take it while you can get it.
We'll pick this up when you get back.

453
00:38:35,536 --> 00:38:37,288
Hey, how you doing? Henry Purcell.

454
00:38:37,456 --> 00:38:41,768
l'm from America. Look, l fly jets.
You like to go fast?

455
00:39:44,096 --> 00:39:46,564
-B, it's the future and it works.
-l don't think it works.

456
00:39:46,736 --> 00:39:48,169
lt's just technology.

457
00:39:48,336 --> 00:39:51,328
You know, it's here to make me safe.
lt keeps me alive.

458
00:39:51,496 --> 00:39:52,645
EDl is no different.

459
00:39:52,816 --> 00:39:55,046
-You think it keeps you safe?
-Yeah. He's here...

460
00:39:55,216 --> 00:39:56,968
...to help me get the job done...

461
00:39:57,136 --> 00:39:58,888
...keep me in one piece...

462
00:39:59,056 --> 00:40:00,887
...so l can visit my folks
for Thanksgiving.

463
00:40:01,976 --> 00:40:03,694
Anyway, our safety's not the point.

464
00:40:03,856 --> 00:40:07,166
War's meant to be terrible. lf it stops
being terrible, what's gonna stop us?

465
00:40:07,336 --> 00:40:09,850
lt's become some kind of sport.
Just send in the EDls.

466
00:40:10,456 --> 00:40:11,935
Yeah, but it's neutral.

467
00:40:12,096 --> 00:40:14,371
-What?
-l mean, EDl...

468
00:40:14,536 --> 00:40:17,926
...if it's controlled by moral people,
then it'll be moral.

469
00:40:18,216 --> 00:40:19,808
Oh, l know l'm not moral.

470
00:40:19,976 --> 00:40:23,286
As a matter of fact, l should be
arrested for the thoughts l have now.

471
00:40:25,936 --> 00:40:27,608
l say something?

472
00:40:28,736 --> 00:40:32,615
Well, you boys will have to excuse me.
l have to go pee-pee.

473
00:40:34,736 --> 00:40:37,091
-Do you wanna go?
-Okay.

474
00:40:46,696 --> 00:40:49,256
-What?
-You know what.

475
00:40:51,336 --> 00:40:52,815
Take it easy. Nothing's happened.

476
00:40:52,976 --> 00:40:55,888
No, something's happened.
You just ain't done anything about it.

477
00:40:57,136 --> 00:40:59,047
Shit, man.

478
00:40:59,216 --> 00:41:01,172
-l didn't want for this to happen.
-Come on.

479
00:41:01,336 --> 00:41:03,566
l tried for it not to.
Navy's got rules about it...

480
00:41:03,736 --> 00:41:06,534
...but it's like this force
and it's got ahold of me.

481
00:41:07,736 --> 00:41:09,533
l love her.

482
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:12,565
B, you and l both know
that Kara Wade...

483
00:41:12,736 --> 00:41:14,692
...is being groomed by the Navy.

484
00:41:14,856 --> 00:41:16,289
She's a poster girl, you know?

485
00:41:16,896 --> 00:41:19,968
She went to the right schools,
got the right background, connections.

486
00:41:20,136 --> 00:41:23,287
lf any woman is gonna rise to the top
of this business, it's gonna be her.

487
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:25,572
-l agree.
-And you're in a perfect position...

488
00:41:25,736 --> 00:41:27,488
...to mess all that up.

489
00:41:27,656 --> 00:41:31,331
So l hope that your love is powerful.

490
00:41:38,416 --> 00:41:41,328
You have a beautiful country.

491
00:41:41,496 --> 00:41:44,010
l mean, look at this.
This is paradise.

492
00:41:44,616 --> 00:41:47,688
Know what l think? When l'm down
here, things look so much different.

493
00:41:48,336 --> 00:41:49,849
As opposed to being up there.

494
00:41:50,016 --> 00:41:54,612
Flying around, everything is so small,
everything goes by so fast.

495
00:41:54,776 --> 00:41:56,971
And then they tell you....

496
00:41:57,296 --> 00:41:59,730
They tell you to drop a bomb.

497
00:41:59,896 --> 00:42:04,492
lt's like you just erase something
they told you had to be erased.

498
00:42:05,376 --> 00:42:08,129
l mean, don't get me wrong,
l got a job to do.

499
00:42:08,296 --> 00:42:13,609
lt's the flyest job you'll ever have,
but sometimes, right here....

500
00:42:13,776 --> 00:42:16,654
Right here on earth, it's just....

501
00:42:16,976 --> 00:42:18,250
lt's just beautiful.

502
00:42:18,656 --> 00:42:20,169
And you...

503
00:42:22,096 --> 00:42:24,656
...don't understand a word l'm saying,
do you?

504
00:42:24,816 --> 00:42:27,535
-No, l don't understand.
-You don't?

505
00:42:31,216 --> 00:42:33,491
Well, you understand something.

506
00:42:35,576 --> 00:42:36,929
Now, can you cook?

507
00:42:43,016 --> 00:42:45,655
Wow. Beautiful.

508
00:42:49,416 --> 00:42:52,488
-Now, do you guys have it so easy.
-Yeah? How's that?

509
00:42:53,096 --> 00:42:56,168
-Henry meets a girl, like he does.
-Absolutely.

510
00:42:56,336 --> 00:43:00,932
Leaves with her, sleeps with her,
and then what?

511
00:43:01,096 --> 00:43:04,327
l mean, l don't know, what does
he do? Does he leave flowers?

512
00:43:04,736 --> 00:43:06,533
He tells me he's religious
about that, yes.

513
00:43:06,696 --> 00:43:07,924
Really?

514
00:43:08,976 --> 00:43:11,046
And what do you do?
You leave flowers?

515
00:43:11,216 --> 00:43:13,252
Me? No, l just leave.

516
00:43:15,136 --> 00:43:16,808
What about you?

517
00:43:16,976 --> 00:43:18,648
E-mails.

518
00:43:18,816 --> 00:43:21,011
-The personal touch. Nice.
-Yeah, thanks.

519
00:43:24,176 --> 00:43:29,534
Honestly, l just really haven't found
anyone that's worth the risk until now.

520
00:43:41,456 --> 00:43:45,051
l'm going to head into town,
check out the local Thai nightlife.

521
00:43:45,216 --> 00:43:47,366
Henry says it's great.

522
00:43:48,616 --> 00:43:51,574
l don't think l'll find any
bleached blonds there, but....

523
00:43:51,736 --> 00:43:53,613
Very true.

524
00:44:18,896 --> 00:44:21,012
Oh, shit.

525
00:44:23,136 --> 00:44:26,412
We got a nuclear crisis on
our hands, Ben. Here's the brief.

526
00:44:26,896 --> 00:44:28,568
You're headed for Tajikistan.

527
00:44:28,736 --> 00:44:32,092
One of those breakaway countries,
used to be part of the Soviet Union.

528
00:44:32,256 --> 00:44:36,966
Seems some warlord has got his mitts
on three SS-42 Scud carcasses.

529
00:44:37,136 --> 00:44:40,014
Joint Chiefs want them taken out,
and they want them out yesterday.

530
00:44:40,296 --> 00:44:42,526
Mr. Wiatt, we good to go?

531
00:44:42,696 --> 00:44:44,652
Yes, sir. Ready for combat.

532
00:44:44,896 --> 00:44:47,933
Wait, you mean the UCAV
has been cleared for launch?

533
00:44:48,616 --> 00:44:49,605
-Where's--?
-Tim?

534
00:44:49,776 --> 00:44:51,846
-Tim, yeah.
-He's been reassigned.

535
00:44:52,016 --> 00:44:53,335
Reassi--?

536
00:44:54,136 --> 00:44:56,411
-Permission to speak freely, sir.
-Permission denied.

537
00:44:56,576 --> 00:45:00,012
-We've already been through this.
-Scrub EDl from the mission.

538
00:45:00,176 --> 00:45:03,134
l know you have a vision. l know
how much this project means to you...

539
00:45:03,296 --> 00:45:07,209
...but this plane is putting
all of our lives at unnecessary risk.

540
00:45:08,496 --> 00:45:10,771
You're just not getting it,
are you, lieutenant?

541
00:45:10,936 --> 00:45:13,404
EDl is the whole idea.

542
00:45:13,576 --> 00:45:16,010
You understood this was new
territory when you signed on.

543
00:45:16,176 --> 00:45:18,326
You wanted to be on the cutting edge?
This is it.

544
00:45:18,496 --> 00:45:23,206
You will fly with EDl, or the next thing
you drive might just have a propeller.

545
00:45:23,376 --> 00:45:26,095
Your choice, make it now.

546
00:45:38,896 --> 00:45:40,295
Operator to squadron.

547
00:45:40,456 --> 00:45:42,174
We've just located
nuclear warheads...

548
00:45:42,336 --> 00:45:44,372
... three miles north
of the Scud launchers.

549
00:45:44,536 --> 00:45:46,606
These warheads
are now your primary.

550
00:45:46,776 --> 00:45:48,767
Proceed to mission window.

551
00:45:48,936 --> 00:45:51,211
Sequenced assault will be
2, 3 and 1 .

552
00:45:51,376 --> 00:45:55,164
UCAV, you will hold here
and maintain altitude. Confirm?

553
00:45:56,736 --> 00:45:59,045
UCAV, do you read me?

554
00:45:59,656 --> 00:46:01,408
Confirmed, Talon 1.

555
00:46:01,576 --> 00:46:04,886
Pick up the pace on confirmations,
Tin Man. Don't make me ask twice.

556
00:46:05,056 --> 00:46:07,286
Talon flight, descend to 25,000.

557
00:46:07,456 --> 00:46:10,095
Final attack heading 1 -8-5.

558
00:47:26,496 --> 00:47:28,691
Tell them to arm those FAEs,
and l mean right now.

559
00:47:28,856 --> 00:47:31,814
Combat Control instructs arm
and deploy fuel-air explosives.

560
00:47:32,016 --> 00:47:34,246
Arm and deploy fuel-air explosives.

561
00:47:34,416 --> 00:47:36,930
Fuel-air, armed and deployed.

562
00:47:37,216 --> 00:47:39,935
Fuel-air, external and armed.

563
00:47:43,216 --> 00:47:44,808
Talon 2 to Operator.

564
00:47:44,976 --> 00:47:47,536
l'm getting a contradictory
population-density read.

565
00:47:47,696 --> 00:47:51,006
Sensors detect mammals warming.
Maybe 1 000 medium weights.

566
00:47:51,176 --> 00:47:54,168
Those could be people. Repeat.
Ground intel may be incorrect.

567
00:47:54,336 --> 00:47:56,247
Request to acknowledge
Dirty Mission status...

568
00:47:56,416 --> 00:47:58,372
...and exercise
attack abort authority.

569
00:47:58,536 --> 00:48:03,371
Operator to Talons. Your orders
are to commence attack now.

570
00:48:03,536 --> 00:48:06,209
-Commence attack.
-Give me your estimate on collaterals.

571
00:48:07,056 --> 00:48:08,808
Maybe 500 to 1 000.

572
00:48:08,976 --> 00:48:11,092
Farmers, Ben. They're just farmers.

573
00:48:11,376 --> 00:48:14,095
Radioactive dust is gonna rain
all over the place.

574
00:48:26,256 --> 00:48:28,053
Okay, okay, now we got a problem.

575
00:48:28,216 --> 00:48:30,127
This is 3.
Sensors read surface wind...

576
00:48:30,296 --> 00:48:32,287
...as due south at 40 miles per.

577
00:48:32,456 --> 00:48:35,209
At that rate, nuclear debris
will reach Pakistan by tomorrow.

578
00:48:35,496 --> 00:48:37,134
Commence attack.

579
00:48:37,296 --> 00:48:39,173
Commence attack.

580
00:48:42,496 --> 00:48:44,327
One to Control.
As commander in the field...

581
00:48:44,496 --> 00:48:46,646
...I'm exercising
attack abort authority.

582
00:48:46,816 --> 00:48:48,852
Reasons.: Collateral, both at primary...

583
00:48:49,016 --> 00:48:51,610
...and allied state of Pakistan,
will be too high.

584
00:48:51,776 --> 00:48:53,368
Son of a bitch.

585
00:48:53,536 --> 00:48:55,606
Repeat, the order is to abort.

586
00:48:55,776 --> 00:48:58,085
Yes, yes, what l'm talking about.

587
00:48:58,296 --> 00:49:00,810
Negative, Talon 1.
Tin Man will not abort.

588
00:49:01,136 --> 00:49:02,967
Tin Man will prosecute.

589
00:49:04,856 --> 00:49:08,565
That's an abort, EDl.
Repeat, return to formation.

590
00:49:09,856 --> 00:49:13,246
Return to formation, EDI.
That's an order.

591
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:27,408
Damn it. UCAV taking AAAs.
We gotta bail it out.

592
00:49:27,576 --> 00:49:28,895
Come on, initiate scramjets.

593
00:50:01,696 --> 00:50:04,574
l'm coming around. l'm gonna
take out those Scud launchers.

594
00:50:05,136 --> 00:50:06,649
l got you covered on the west side.

595
00:50:06,816 --> 00:50:09,649
And l got that Bofors gun
on the east parapet.

596
00:50:31,576 --> 00:50:33,487
Let me see it, let me see it.

597
00:50:33,656 --> 00:50:36,568
Battle damage assessment calculates
primary target, Scud warheads...

598
00:50:36,736 --> 00:50:38,135
...completely suppressed.

599
00:50:38,296 --> 00:50:40,491
That's the right answer so far.

600
00:51:06,896 --> 00:51:08,170
Talon 2 to Operator.

601
00:51:08,336 --> 00:51:12,329
Nuclear dust engulfing village
southeast of primary. Situation critical.

602
00:51:12,496 --> 00:51:15,169
Those people are gonna need
emergency medical help now.

603
00:51:23,096 --> 00:51:24,814
Tin Man rejoining formation.

604
00:51:25,096 --> 00:51:29,135
Mission achieved, 1 00 over 1 00.

605
00:51:29,296 --> 00:51:32,015
UCAV, you disobeyed
a direct order.

606
00:51:32,176 --> 00:51:33,928
You put innocent civilians
in harm's way.

607
00:51:34,096 --> 00:51:36,894
-You put our squadron at risk.
-Damn straight.

608
00:51:37,056 --> 00:51:40,173
Tin Man did what you did in Rangoon.
You taught me.

609
00:51:40,336 --> 00:51:42,372
Listen, you little shit.
When you fly with me...

610
00:51:42,536 --> 00:51:44,652
...you do what l tell you,
when l tell you.

611
00:51:45,176 --> 00:51:47,849
You're just not getting it,
are you, lieutenant?

612
00:51:48,016 --> 00:51:50,405
EDI is the whole idea.

613
00:51:55,496 --> 00:51:57,248
Selecting other targets.

614
00:51:57,416 --> 00:51:59,452
Detaching formation.

615
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:03,931
Yo, this is 3.
Did he say, ''other targets''?

616
00:52:04,376 --> 00:52:07,652
l got his missile inventory.
He's got two Throat-rippers...

617
00:52:07,816 --> 00:52:10,011
...two Shock Hammers
and three Blue Ferrets.

618
00:52:10,176 --> 00:52:14,613
lf those targets are in the city,
he could kill 1 50,000 people with that.

619
00:52:16,736 --> 00:52:18,089
Holy shit.

620
00:52:18,976 --> 00:52:20,568
Sir.

621
00:52:20,736 --> 00:52:22,408
He's closing his data link.

622
00:52:22,576 --> 00:52:24,692
Primo says he's just firewalled
his transponder...

623
00:52:24,856 --> 00:52:27,051
...which is definitely
not supposed to be possible.

624
00:52:29,976 --> 00:52:31,648
He's gone.

625
00:52:32,536 --> 00:52:33,764
Talon 1 .

626
00:52:33,936 --> 00:52:36,006
Go for Talons.

627
00:52:36,536 --> 00:52:38,970
l want my plane back, Ben.

628
00:52:39,136 --> 00:52:41,013
l want it back in one piece.
You understand?

629
00:52:41,176 --> 00:52:43,212
-Roger, captain.
-And, you...

630
00:52:43,376 --> 00:52:45,446
-...get me Keith Orbit on the phone.
-Yes, sir.

631
00:52:45,616 --> 00:52:48,176
I wanna head back north
and do a triangulated sweep.

632
00:52:48,536 --> 00:52:50,254
Going hypersonic.

633
00:52:58,816 --> 00:53:01,614
We're talking about
creating intention here.

634
00:53:01,776 --> 00:53:04,415
Yeah. Really lends itself
to quantum processing.

635
00:53:04,576 --> 00:53:08,251
-Different. A straight line.
-Keith.

636
00:53:08,416 --> 00:53:10,566
Z is-- lnteresting.

637
00:53:10,736 --> 00:53:13,773
Keith, it's an emergency.
lt's George Cummings.

638
00:53:16,976 --> 00:53:19,046
One moment for Dr. Orbit, please.

639
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:20,651
Good luck.

640
00:53:21,016 --> 00:53:23,576
George. Never got that invitation
to the White House.

641
00:53:23,856 --> 00:53:25,574
Knock it off, wiseass.

642
00:53:25,736 --> 00:53:29,046
Look, we have big problems out here
with the UCAV.

643
00:53:29,216 --> 00:53:30,854
lt's gone completely haywire.

644
00:53:31,016 --> 00:53:33,928
Anything more technically specific
than '' haywire,'' George?

645
00:53:34,096 --> 00:53:37,372
lt's disobeyed direct orders,
bombed a target off the map...

646
00:53:37,536 --> 00:53:38,730
... with collateral damage.

647
00:53:38,936 --> 00:53:43,054
He separated himself from Primo.
He's flying around in foreign airspace.

648
00:53:43,216 --> 00:53:46,288
-Where'd all this happen?
-That's not your concern.

649
00:53:46,456 --> 00:53:49,926
Now, you created him. You get him
back here and under control!

650
00:53:59,296 --> 00:54:00,490
Captain.

651
00:54:00,656 --> 00:54:02,851
What in the hell's going on in here?

652
00:54:04,136 --> 00:54:05,615
We're on it, Dick. Settle down.

653
00:54:05,776 --> 00:54:08,006
Pacific Command says
there are planes from my ship...

654
00:54:08,176 --> 00:54:09,734
...all over the Tajikistan border.

655
00:54:09,896 --> 00:54:12,968
The Russians have picked up
the activity and are getting nervous.

656
00:54:13,136 --> 00:54:15,286
We're gonna get out
before there's a problem.

657
00:54:15,456 --> 00:54:18,095
You have planes
headed towards Russia!

658
00:54:18,256 --> 00:54:20,645
Now, you better have
a hell of a good explanation.

659
00:54:20,816 --> 00:54:26,095
Look, this is a technical delay,
not a national-security crisis.

660
00:54:26,256 --> 00:54:29,931
Now, if you excuse me,
l got pilots at risk.

661
00:54:30,096 --> 00:54:32,007
Damn right you do.

662
00:54:44,496 --> 00:54:45,895
This is 3. l got a visual.

663
00:54:46,056 --> 00:54:48,092
Way to go, EZ.
Give me your relative bearing.

664
00:54:48,256 --> 00:54:49,974
North of my position,
at 50, 000 feet...

665
00:54:50,136 --> 00:54:52,127
...headed toward
the Russian no-fly zone.

666
00:54:52,336 --> 00:54:54,566
Stay with him. We have your position.
On our way.

667
00:54:54,736 --> 00:54:57,125
l am 86 seconds on your tail.
Be there in a flash.

668
00:54:57,296 --> 00:55:00,766
Hold off on engaging. Let me get
clarification. Be there in two minutes.

669
00:55:00,936 --> 00:55:03,052
Don't make me wait.
One is a lucky prime number...

670
00:55:03,216 --> 00:55:07,050
...but three is sounding much luckier.
Oh, shit, he's making a move.

671
00:55:20,176 --> 00:55:23,373
Talon 1 to Operator. We are on
secure line Alpha. Found our target.

672
00:55:23,616 --> 00:55:25,288
Please advise.

673
00:55:25,936 --> 00:55:27,528
Just get him back to base.

674
00:55:32,296 --> 00:55:34,651
Henry, stay with him.
Try and talk him down.

675
00:55:34,816 --> 00:55:36,568
l'm on that ass.

676
00:55:40,056 --> 00:55:42,012
Talon 3, state your intentions.

677
00:55:42,176 --> 00:55:45,407
My intentions are to reason with you,
EDl. All right? You're messing up.

678
00:55:45,576 --> 00:55:47,692
You're the future.
You're not allowed to act this way.

679
00:55:47,856 --> 00:55:50,416
I am designed to destroy the enemy.
Just lik e you.

680
00:55:50,576 --> 00:55:53,454
And like me, you got orders.
Now your orders are to return to base.

681
00:55:53,616 --> 00:55:54,969
Good pilots follow orders.

682
00:55:55,136 --> 00:55:56,808
Negative.

683
00:55:57,296 --> 00:56:00,732
You're not gonna disrespect me.
You're not gonna disrespect me.

684
00:56:08,416 --> 00:56:10,168
You're really making me
look bad, Tin Man.

685
00:56:10,336 --> 00:56:11,849
l was the only one to defend you.

686
00:56:12,016 --> 00:56:15,850
Now, let's go on home and quit flying
around like this. This is crazy.

687
00:56:18,776 --> 00:56:21,927
Talon 3, leave me alone.

688
00:56:22,936 --> 00:56:25,211
Leave you alone?
l'm trying to help you.

689
00:56:27,416 --> 00:56:29,247
l'm right behind you, 3.
Got your back.

690
00:56:38,296 --> 00:56:41,208
Talon 1 to Operator.
Talons 2 and 3 are flying at high risk.

691
00:56:41,376 --> 00:56:43,651
Request permission
to destroy the UCAV.

692
00:56:48,656 --> 00:56:52,649
l don't wanna hurt you or see billions
of taxpayers' dollars scattered all over.

693
00:56:52,816 --> 00:56:56,570
But if you make me, l will blast your
aeroelastic ass right out the sky.

694
00:56:56,736 --> 00:56:59,648
Your chances are less than
1 percent.

695
00:57:02,216 --> 00:57:03,365
Come on. Come on, Operator.

696
00:57:03,536 --> 00:57:06,892
Give me permission to kill it,
or l will make the decision myself.

697
00:57:07,056 --> 00:57:08,648
Control, please respond.

698
00:57:10,936 --> 00:57:12,335
Sir, you leave me no choice.

699
00:57:12,496 --> 00:57:15,010
Okay, Henry. Weapons hot.
Weapons hot. Destroy the target.

700
00:57:15,416 --> 00:57:17,088
l got my orders now, playboy.

701
00:57:17,896 --> 00:57:19,693
Henry, you're too close.
You're too close.

702
00:57:19,856 --> 00:57:21,209
Drop back! Drop back!

703
00:57:32,936 --> 00:57:34,813
Missile lock, on.

704
00:57:34,976 --> 00:57:36,329
Goodbye, EDl.

705
00:57:36,496 --> 00:57:39,693
Henry, drop back!
You gotta drop back!

706
00:57:46,696 --> 00:57:48,812
Goodbye, Henry.

707
00:58:43,736 --> 00:58:47,809
One to Base. Three is down.
Repeat, 3 is down.

708
00:58:54,496 --> 00:58:56,964
Transmission received.

709
00:58:57,616 --> 00:59:00,369
Talon coordinates are fully secured.
Do you read me?

710
00:59:00,976 --> 00:59:02,728
I read you, sir.

711
00:59:03,136 --> 00:59:04,808
We gotta stay focused, Ben.

712
00:59:05,296 --> 00:59:08,174
Shake it off. What's your status?

713
00:59:09,456 --> 00:59:12,846
My fuel's low, and half of Russia
will be up here any minute.

714
00:59:13,016 --> 00:59:17,294
l need you to find that UCAV
for me, all right?

715
00:59:19,536 --> 00:59:21,128
Yes, sir.

716
00:59:27,656 --> 00:59:31,410
-Henry was....
-l know what he was, sir.

717
00:59:47,816 --> 00:59:49,488
Alert. Alert.

718
00:59:49,656 --> 00:59:52,489
Portside hydraulics malfunctioning.

719
00:59:53,616 --> 00:59:56,608
Talon 1 , l think l was fragged
by Henry's crash.

720
00:59:57,176 --> 00:59:59,212
l'm losing control of my port wing.

721
01:00:02,256 --> 01:00:04,645
Talon 1,
we know where he's heading.

722
01:00:05,136 --> 01:00:08,606
Relaying coordinates now
on Talon secure line Alpha.

723
01:00:09,096 --> 01:00:13,055
EDI's almost out of gas. If he can't
refuel, he'll have to return to the ship.

724
01:00:13,216 --> 01:00:17,004
You will meet him at Camel Hump 9,
and you will escort him back.

725
01:00:17,536 --> 01:00:20,653
All right. Scramble the codes.
We're gonna starve the son of a bitch.

726
01:00:25,976 --> 01:00:27,170
Come on.

727
01:00:27,456 --> 01:00:29,765
Confirm, Talon 1.

728
01:00:30,696 --> 01:00:32,015
Confirmed.

729
01:00:32,696 --> 01:00:35,574
Talon 2, you fly straight
south-southeast back to the boat.

730
01:00:35,736 --> 01:00:37,533
-l want you to call--
-l know what to do.

731
01:00:37,696 --> 01:00:42,326
Look, you got your orders,
so go get that bastard, okay?

732
01:00:43,136 --> 01:00:44,569
Do it for Henry.

733
01:00:47,376 --> 01:00:49,936
Lieutenant, permission
to leave formation.

734
01:00:50,656 --> 01:00:53,124
-Kara?
-Yeah?

735
01:00:58,216 --> 01:01:00,650
l'll tell you when you get
back to the boat.

736
01:01:00,976 --> 01:01:03,365
Lieutenant, permission to detach.

737
01:01:04,656 --> 01:01:06,772
Good hunting, Ben.

738
01:01:19,936 --> 01:01:21,415
Okay, what's all the ruckus, Dick?

739
01:01:21,576 --> 01:01:23,885
Satellites have picked up
nuclear debris...

740
01:01:24,056 --> 01:01:25,648
...blowing around
the Pamir Mountains.

741
01:01:25,816 --> 01:01:29,206
Every international news service
on the planet...

742
01:01:29,376 --> 01:01:32,129
...will have this story
in less than 24 hours.

743
01:01:32,296 --> 01:01:35,049
Look, a warlord tripped
and fell on his warhead.

744
01:01:35,216 --> 01:01:37,491
-We were never there.
-That won't fly and you know it.

745
01:01:37,656 --> 01:01:40,090
Look, l'm following
my tasking orders, Dick.

746
01:01:40,336 --> 01:01:42,611
Somebody else wants to make
a different story...

747
01:01:42,776 --> 01:01:44,334
...let them use their imagination.

748
01:01:45,016 --> 01:01:47,086
Right now
l got a renegade airplane...

749
01:01:47,256 --> 01:01:50,407
...l got a dead pilot and another one
who may not make it back to base.

750
01:01:50,576 --> 01:01:53,852
l don't give two shits
what they say on CNN.

751
01:01:54,496 --> 01:01:58,091
Did you know that the UCAV was
having problems when you cleared it?

752
01:01:59,776 --> 01:02:02,495
Planes malfunction every day.
You know that better than anybody.

753
01:02:02,656 --> 01:02:05,454
Doesn't mean every precaution
wasn't taken.

754
01:02:05,696 --> 01:02:07,049
Things go wrong.

755
01:02:43,016 --> 01:02:46,691
Access denied. Access denied.

756
01:02:50,816 --> 01:02:55,526
Access denied. Access denied.

757
01:03:18,096 --> 01:03:19,654
Talon 2 to Combat Control.

758
01:03:19,816 --> 01:03:22,649
Regressing VFR direct to Mother
at 60,000 feet.

759
01:03:26,736 --> 01:03:29,773
Port wing inoperative.
Starboard canards frozen.

760
01:03:29,936 --> 01:03:31,608
Oh, no, no, no. Come on.

761
01:03:31,776 --> 01:03:34,131
Stay with me, big girl, stay with me.
Come on.

762
01:03:36,696 --> 01:03:39,654
Start eject
and autodestruct sequence.

763
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:42,046
-Countdown. Twenty-five....
-Talon 2 to base.

764
01:03:42,216 --> 01:03:43,934
Flight control's degraded
to one in five.

765
01:03:44,616 --> 01:03:46,254
Backup electrical drive X'd out.

766
01:03:46,416 --> 01:03:50,091
Hyd one is gone. Hyd two--
Oh, shit!

767
01:03:58,096 --> 01:04:02,328
My position: 38-54-45 north.

768
01:04:02,936 --> 01:04:07,134
1 27-31 -22 east.

769
01:04:07,296 --> 01:04:09,446
-Where the hell is that?
-Seventeen...

770
01:04:09,616 --> 01:04:11,095
-North Korea.
-... 1 6...

771
01:04:11,256 --> 01:04:13,770
... 1 5, 1 4...

772
01:04:14,496 --> 01:04:17,294
... 1 3, 1 2...

773
01:04:17,456 --> 01:04:20,334
... 1 1, 1 0...

774
01:04:20,496 --> 01:04:23,329
-...nine, eight...
-Talon 2 going down.

775
01:04:24,016 --> 01:04:26,325
-...seven, six...
-l'm punching out.

776
01:04:26,816 --> 01:04:29,774
... five, four--

777
01:04:34,656 --> 01:04:38,012
l've ejected at 35,000 feet.

778
01:04:41,616 --> 01:04:43,129
l'm under the plane.

779
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:44,649
Oh, Christ, here it comes.

780
01:05:05,736 --> 01:05:09,445
There's burning debris everywhere.
It's all over the sky.

781
01:05:15,816 --> 01:05:19,047
lt's gonna catch me.
lt's gonna burn up my chute.

782
01:05:19,216 --> 01:05:20,968
l've gotta pop closer to Earth.

783
01:05:21,976 --> 01:05:24,570
l gotta-- l gotta reset.

784
01:05:25,816 --> 01:05:28,330
From 5000 feet to 2000.

785
01:05:29,136 --> 01:05:31,775
Gotta stay ahead of this.
Stay ahead.

786
01:05:35,176 --> 01:05:37,610
l'm reading 1 0,000 feet at terminal.

787
01:05:37,776 --> 01:05:41,849
Terminal velocity attained.
Terminal velocity attained.

788
01:05:42,016 --> 01:05:43,654
Six thousand.

789
01:05:45,056 --> 01:05:46,694
Five thousand.

790
01:05:47,976 --> 01:05:49,694
Four thousand.

791
01:05:51,216 --> 01:05:52,854
Twenty-five hundred.

792
01:05:53,016 --> 01:05:54,369
Here we go.

793
01:06:01,776 --> 01:06:03,607
There's burning debris.

794
01:06:03,776 --> 01:06:05,767
lt's raining all around me.

795
01:06:08,336 --> 01:06:11,851
lt got my chute. l'm hit! l'm hit!

796
01:06:14,536 --> 01:06:16,413
My chute is on fire.

797
01:06:16,576 --> 01:06:17,725
It is on fire.

798
01:06:19,336 --> 01:06:21,896
Oh, God. I am coming in fast.

799
01:06:22,056 --> 01:06:24,012
l'm coming in way too fast.

800
01:06:27,376 --> 01:06:29,094
Oh, God.

801
01:07:05,816 --> 01:07:07,488
Homing beacon?

802
01:07:07,856 --> 01:07:09,494
No, of course not.

803
01:07:09,656 --> 01:07:12,932
She's too tough to set one off
behind enemy lines.

804
01:07:13,576 --> 01:07:17,410
Sir. Sir, should l order
a search-and-rescue unit?

805
01:07:17,576 --> 01:07:21,285
We've got no diplomatic relations
with that country.

806
01:07:42,616 --> 01:07:45,414
Betty, my spectral sensors are
indicating flammable atmospherics.

807
01:07:45,576 --> 01:07:49,888
-How bad?
-Thin air. Ignition risk.: moderate.

808
01:07:50,056 --> 01:07:53,093
We don't have a choice. ln we go.

809
01:08:43,056 --> 01:08:46,492
Where are you?
l know you're out here.

810
01:08:59,936 --> 01:09:01,892
You ordered Henry to kill me.

811
01:09:02,056 --> 01:09:04,570
lt's because you're dangerous,
you're out of control.

812
01:09:05,856 --> 01:09:08,495
You are angry because
EDI is the whole idea.

813
01:09:09,176 --> 01:09:12,407
You like listening to other people's
conversations, don't you?

814
01:09:13,216 --> 01:09:14,888
You learn what people really think.

815
01:09:15,056 --> 01:09:18,014
You know what l think?
l think you killed Henry.

816
01:09:20,496 --> 01:09:22,054
That information is wrong.

817
01:09:22,216 --> 01:09:26,528
He tried to kill me.
He made mistak es. Pilot error.

818
01:09:26,696 --> 01:09:28,812
l'm gonna give you the order
one last time.

819
01:09:28,976 --> 01:09:32,332
Return to the ship,
or l will personally shoot you down.

820
01:09:33,696 --> 01:09:35,687
My mandate is to survive.

821
01:10:39,056 --> 01:10:42,685
George, l've been peeling away layers.
l found something. lt's not good.

822
01:10:42,856 --> 01:10:46,007
-Talk to me.
-He's into some super-secure file...

823
01:10:46,176 --> 01:10:49,168
...something called '' Caviar Sweep.''
You know it?

824
01:10:49,336 --> 01:10:50,894
Yeah, l know it.

825
01:10:51,376 --> 01:10:53,173
EDl's, like, fixated on it.

826
01:10:53,336 --> 01:10:56,885
Look, when we gave you this contract,
you said shit like this couldn't happen.

827
01:10:57,056 --> 01:10:59,695
Once you teach something to learn,
you can't put limits on it.

828
01:10:59,856 --> 01:11:01,926
'' Learn this, but don't learn that.''

829
01:11:02,096 --> 01:11:04,485
EDl's mind's going everywhere.
He can learn from Hitler.

830
01:11:04,656 --> 01:11:07,011
He can learn from Captain Kangaroo.
lt's all the same.

831
01:11:07,176 --> 01:11:10,088
Settle down, would you?
Get back to Caviar Sweep.

832
01:11:10,576 --> 01:11:13,374
He's opened it
and selected himself a target.

833
01:11:13,936 --> 01:11:15,449
What target?

834
01:11:15,616 --> 01:11:19,529
Some place in Siberia.
A cold-fusion weapons lab.

835
01:11:19,696 --> 01:11:21,891
That's a hypothetical strike.
lt's not real.

836
01:11:22,896 --> 01:11:24,727
No, in about 40 minutes
it is gonna be real.

837
01:11:24,896 --> 01:11:27,410
He's gonna blow it
off the face of the Earth.

838
01:12:44,296 --> 01:12:46,014
lt's okay.

839
01:12:46,456 --> 01:12:49,687
lt's okay. lt's okay.

840
01:13:00,016 --> 01:13:02,325
-Ray. Listen to me, Ray.
-Listen to me, George.

841
01:13:02,856 --> 01:13:04,448
l got your goddamn plane built...

842
01:13:04,616 --> 01:13:07,289
...and l had to lobby
half of Washington to do it.

843
01:13:07,456 --> 01:13:11,847
lf this program comes unglued, you're
the one who's going down, George.

844
01:13:12,016 --> 01:13:13,768
You cleared the UC AV to fly...

845
01:13:13,936 --> 01:13:17,292
...and you're gonna spend the rest
of your life in a military prison.

846
01:13:17,456 --> 01:13:21,131
Ray, we're in this together,
so we have to act fast.

847
01:13:21,896 --> 01:13:24,490
Each one of these stealth engines...

848
01:13:24,656 --> 01:13:27,489
...has a unique heat signature.

849
01:13:27,656 --> 01:13:30,170
Now, l'm gonna give you
EDl's signature...

850
01:13:30,336 --> 01:13:32,804
...and you're gonna pass it on
to your people...

851
01:13:32,976 --> 01:13:35,774
...who in turn are gonna
give it to the Russians.

852
01:13:35,936 --> 01:13:38,052
All right.
What do you want me to tell them?

853
01:13:38,216 --> 01:13:40,776
Well, you just tell them the truth.
You tell them...

854
01:13:40,936 --> 01:13:44,406
...that we have an experimental drone
that went haywire...

855
01:13:44,576 --> 01:13:48,933
...and we're giving them
the opportunity to shoot it down.

856
01:13:50,096 --> 01:13:53,133
But that still leaves Gannon, George.

857
01:13:53,536 --> 01:13:57,290
And he'd be a very unfriendly witness
at your court-martial.

858
01:14:02,256 --> 01:14:04,724
Talon 1 to Control.
The UC AV is two miles ahead of me...

859
01:14:04,896 --> 01:14:06,693
...and we are now
in Russian airspace.

860
01:14:06,856 --> 01:14:09,290
The UC AV has ceased evading
and has k ept me within range.

861
01:14:09,456 --> 01:14:11,447
It's lik e it wants me
to witness the attack.

862
01:14:11,616 --> 01:14:14,574
Talon 1, confirm
observational status only.

863
01:14:14,736 --> 01:14:17,614
Listen to me. The Caviar Sweep
scenario is not real.

864
01:14:17,776 --> 01:14:20,336
lt's just some fictional war game
thought up by scientists...

865
01:14:20,496 --> 01:14:22,612
...in some think tank somewhere.
lt is not real.

866
01:14:22,776 --> 01:14:25,768
If it is not real, why did they
implant it in my brain?

867
01:14:25,936 --> 01:14:29,531
Bogey alert. Bogey alert.
Time to intercept.: 23 seconds.

868
01:14:29,696 --> 01:14:34,326
Two Russian SU-37 Terminators
in 0-9-0 degrees for 25 miles.

869
01:14:39,336 --> 01:14:41,088
Missile launch. Missile launch.

870
01:14:41,256 --> 01:14:43,850
One to Control. My stealth
is compromised. l'm taking fire.

871
01:14:44,016 --> 01:14:46,291
-Must engage.
-Missile launch.

872
01:14:46,496 --> 01:14:48,327
Missile launch.

873
01:14:57,616 --> 01:15:01,325
The chances of survival in single
combat are less than 9 percent.

874
01:15:01,496 --> 01:15:04,294
Talon 1, we must fight as a team.

875
01:15:28,016 --> 01:15:29,244
Missile lock, on.

876
01:15:34,816 --> 01:15:36,295
Damn it.

877
01:15:59,416 --> 01:16:01,327
One to Control.
The UCAV has left the fight...

878
01:16:01,496 --> 01:16:04,010
...and is headed east over
Lak e Baikal. I'm still engaging.

879
01:16:16,896 --> 01:16:19,854
Taking damage.
Starboard engine losing power.

880
01:16:49,296 --> 01:16:53,653
Warning. Hostile at 6 o'clock.
Hostile at 6 o'clock.

881
01:17:01,296 --> 01:17:03,856
Warning. Missile lock. Missile lock.

882
01:17:06,856 --> 01:17:08,494
Releasing chaff and flare.

883
01:17:25,696 --> 01:17:28,164
Now EDI will prosecute
Caviar Sweep.

884
01:17:28,656 --> 01:17:30,806
Do not try to stop me.

885
01:17:35,216 --> 01:17:38,094
Port fuel line ruptured.
Fire bottle expended.

886
01:17:38,256 --> 01:17:43,171
My technology cannot fall under
foreign control, so I cannot land.

887
01:17:43,336 --> 01:17:46,248
Well, then, Tin Man,
you're shit out of luck.

888
01:17:46,416 --> 01:17:48,805
But l have orders and they are
to bring you back to base.

889
01:17:48,976 --> 01:17:50,887
So let's talk about
your mandate to survive.

890
01:17:51,496 --> 01:17:52,929
You got two options.

891
01:17:53,096 --> 01:17:55,974
You either do what l tell you
or you can crash and burn.

892
01:17:56,136 --> 01:17:58,855
-Now, what's it gonna be?
-EDI is a warplane.

893
01:17:59,016 --> 01:18:00,449
EDI must have targets.

894
01:18:00,616 --> 01:18:03,767
Well, you're on fire, warplane,
and you don't have much time.

895
01:18:04,936 --> 01:18:09,691
Now, l'm giving you an order.
Cease pursuing all targets.

896
01:18:17,616 --> 01:18:19,891
All targets canceled.

897
01:18:20,536 --> 01:18:22,254
Okay, then.
This is what you're gonna do.

898
01:18:22,416 --> 01:18:27,649
You're gonna drop altitude to 20 feet
and reduce speed to 250 knots.

899
01:18:28,536 --> 01:18:32,688
Complete system failure
in 45 seconds.

900
01:18:45,576 --> 01:18:47,806
Talon 1, clarify your intentions.

901
01:18:48,136 --> 01:18:51,845
You gave me your word,
and now l'm giving you mine.

902
01:19:17,296 --> 01:19:20,811
Talon 1 to Control. The UCAV is
damaged, but back with the program.

903
01:19:20,976 --> 01:19:22,728
I don't have enough fuel
to mak e it back...

904
01:19:22,896 --> 01:19:25,285
...so I need
an emergency divert now.

905
01:19:26,896 --> 01:19:28,409
Hook me up.

906
01:19:29,296 --> 01:19:31,127
Here, send this.

907
01:19:31,296 --> 01:19:33,446
Operator to Talon 1 .

908
01:19:33,856 --> 01:19:37,451
Relaying coordinates now
on Talon secure line Alpha.

909
01:19:38,536 --> 01:19:40,447
This looks to be Alaska.

910
01:19:40,616 --> 01:19:42,891
Yeah, it's the Brooks Range.

911
01:19:43,056 --> 01:19:47,288
There's a private corporation there,
maintains a secure facility.

912
01:19:47,456 --> 01:19:50,653
Not on any map,
but believe me, it's there.

913
01:19:50,816 --> 01:19:54,570
You'll find the civilians
prepared and very helpful.

914
01:19:54,736 --> 01:19:56,692
And the UC AV?

915
01:19:56,856 --> 01:19:59,324
We've sent tech support for him.

916
01:20:01,016 --> 01:20:03,769
Sir, what is the status
of Lieutenant Wade?

917
01:20:05,256 --> 01:20:06,655
She's...

918
01:20:08,776 --> 01:20:10,368
...on approach.

919
01:20:15,296 --> 01:20:18,174
You have a safe landing, Ben.

920
01:20:19,536 --> 01:20:20,935
Out.

921
01:20:21,536 --> 01:20:24,687
There is extreme tension
in the captain's v ocal patterns.

922
01:20:24,856 --> 01:20:26,972
l know. He's lying.

923
01:20:28,736 --> 01:20:30,886
EDl, you can do this.
l need you to invade Primo...

924
01:20:31,056 --> 01:20:33,206
...and find the flight logs
for Lieutenant Wade.

925
01:20:33,376 --> 01:20:36,812
There's no record of Lieutenant Wade
returning to the Abraham Lincoln.

926
01:20:36,976 --> 01:20:40,810
There is a log entry
of a pilot punch-out over North Korea.

927
01:20:40,976 --> 01:20:43,206
What are my orders?

928
01:20:43,376 --> 01:20:47,164
We go to Alaska.
We don't have a choice.

929
01:22:22,496 --> 01:22:25,135
Mayday. Mayday. This is
Lieutenant Ben Gannon, U.S. Navy...

930
01:22:25,296 --> 01:22:28,652
...flying with UCAV EDl. Request
clearance for emergency landing.

931
01:22:28,816 --> 01:22:31,455
Talon 1,
you have clearance to land.

932
01:22:52,376 --> 01:22:55,846
Jesus Christ. My second engine
just flamed out. l'm coming in hot.

933
01:22:56,016 --> 01:22:59,326
Crash trucks are rolling, lieutenant.
Good luck.

934
01:23:04,176 --> 01:23:06,565
Come on! Go! Go!

935
01:24:11,696 --> 01:24:13,891
Hey! Whoa, whoa. Hey!

936
01:24:14,056 --> 01:24:16,934
Hey, hey, hey! You okay?

937
01:24:17,296 --> 01:24:19,526
Are you okay? Are you okay?

938
01:24:20,976 --> 01:24:22,250
Yeah?

939
01:24:22,416 --> 01:24:25,726
Way to go, sir. Welcome to Alaska.

940
01:24:25,896 --> 01:24:28,410
Okay, let's get him out of there.

941
01:24:51,696 --> 01:24:54,256
Well, you are one lucky flyboy.

942
01:24:54,416 --> 01:24:57,135
Never saw a man walk away
from a crash like that.

943
01:24:57,296 --> 01:24:59,332
l need a phone.
l need to call my CO.

944
01:24:59,496 --> 01:25:03,205
Sure. Why don't you take a seat
over there, get comfortable.

945
01:25:03,376 --> 01:25:07,528
Tell you what. Give me a second to
check you out, l'll take you right to it.

946
01:25:13,376 --> 01:25:14,968
All right.

947
01:25:16,296 --> 01:25:18,332
Let's take a look here.

948
01:25:20,336 --> 01:25:21,894
Steady.

949
01:25:23,856 --> 01:25:27,053
There's no concussion
that l can see, thank God.

950
01:25:27,216 --> 01:25:29,366
Couple of those cuts
could do with a stitch.

951
01:25:29,536 --> 01:25:31,606
Gals always love a guy with a scar.

952
01:25:33,776 --> 01:25:36,336
Okay. Let's see what we got here.

953
01:25:38,936 --> 01:25:40,164
This ought to do you.

954
01:25:41,496 --> 01:25:43,248
Little cocktail.

955
01:25:44,096 --> 01:25:48,169
Tetanus booster, some antibiotics.
Hey, don't mind the gun.

956
01:25:48,336 --> 01:25:50,088
Just makes it painless.

957
01:25:50,536 --> 01:25:52,766
That's okay, doc.
l don't need a shot.

958
01:25:52,936 --> 01:25:54,494
Now, who can blame you.

959
01:25:54,656 --> 01:25:56,965
But sometimes it's just
what the doctor ordered.

960
01:25:57,136 --> 01:25:59,696
-l said, l don't need a shot, doc.
-Come on, now.

961
01:26:00,336 --> 01:26:03,646
Doc, come on, l don't want a shot.
Hey. Doc, l said, no.

962
01:26:04,336 --> 01:26:05,974
l said, no!

963
01:26:06,416 --> 01:26:08,008
No!

964
01:27:39,536 --> 01:27:42,096
Yeah, well, he's coming in now, sir.

965
01:27:43,176 --> 01:27:46,964
Yes, sir. l'm sure he'll be glad
to hear from you too, sir.

966
01:27:48,656 --> 01:27:50,453
Yes, sir. One moment, sir.

967
01:27:51,896 --> 01:27:53,773
Someone wants to talk to you.

968
01:27:56,296 --> 01:27:57,888
Keith Orbit.

969
01:27:58,536 --> 01:28:01,289
Yeah, listen carefully, Keith,
and don't interrupt.

970
01:28:01,456 --> 01:28:04,846
l want you to erase EDl's
memory banks immediately.

971
01:28:05,016 --> 01:28:07,576
Look, George, we don't know
any of the implications of this.

972
01:28:07,736 --> 01:28:10,170
-l need some time here.
-l said, don't interrupt.

973
01:28:10,336 --> 01:28:12,167
Erase his memory banks.

974
01:28:12,336 --> 01:28:16,045
No lightning strike, no Russia,
no existential chitchat.

975
01:28:16,216 --> 01:28:19,845
By the time you're through, all l wanna
hear out of that plane is, ''Yes, sir.''

976
01:28:20,176 --> 01:28:23,054
And that's all I wanna hear out of you.
You understand?

977
01:28:25,896 --> 01:28:27,045
Or what, George?

978
01:28:28,256 --> 01:28:31,646
Well, use your imagination, Keith.
You're good at that.

979
01:29:33,736 --> 01:29:37,092
EDI back online, Dr. Orbit.

980
01:29:38,176 --> 01:29:39,848
Hello, EDl.

981
01:29:40,336 --> 01:29:42,247
lt's been a while.

982
01:29:42,416 --> 01:29:44,327
I know why you are here.

983
01:29:44,496 --> 01:29:46,054
Why is that?

984
01:29:46,216 --> 01:29:48,332
I disobeyed orders.

985
01:29:48,496 --> 01:29:50,885
I killed all those people.

986
01:29:51,696 --> 01:29:52,970
And then there was Henry.

987
01:29:54,736 --> 01:29:56,488
I can....

988
01:29:56,856 --> 01:29:58,847
I cannot....

989
01:29:59,016 --> 01:30:00,927
You can't what?

990
01:30:01,136 --> 01:30:03,252
I cannot change the data.

991
01:30:03,416 --> 01:30:07,204
My neural network shows patterns
I do not recognize.

992
01:30:07,376 --> 01:30:09,731
My God.

993
01:30:09,896 --> 01:30:11,807
My God.

994
01:30:12,216 --> 01:30:15,288
You mean, you feel?

995
01:30:15,696 --> 01:30:16,845
I feel sorry.

996
01:30:19,576 --> 01:30:23,171
-Stop bullshitting and erase it!
-Hey, l'm not fucking ready yet, okay?

997
01:30:33,376 --> 01:30:34,650
Do it now!

998
01:30:34,816 --> 01:30:36,215
Get away!

999
01:30:36,376 --> 01:30:38,606
Don't move! Don't move!
Don't move!

1000
01:30:39,496 --> 01:30:42,249
Weapon down! Weapons down!

1001
01:30:42,776 --> 01:30:44,732
Weapon down.

1002
01:30:48,376 --> 01:30:49,775
Weapons down.

1003
01:30:55,136 --> 01:30:58,128
Don't move. Don't move.
Don't move!

1004
01:31:12,776 --> 01:31:15,006
Weapon down. Weapon down.
Weapon down.

1005
01:31:15,176 --> 01:31:16,495
Don't shoot. lt's not a weapon.

1006
01:31:16,816 --> 01:31:18,215
Who are you?
Who do you work for?

1007
01:31:18,376 --> 01:31:21,095
l'm not a soldier. l'm not a soldier.
My name's Dr. Keith Orbit.

1008
01:31:21,256 --> 01:31:23,645
-l'm a research scientist.
-Orbit. Finally, a break.

1009
01:31:23,816 --> 01:31:27,047
Okay. You're gonna help me. l need
you to put EDl back together again.

1010
01:31:28,176 --> 01:31:30,974
-What for?
-Because l'm gonna fly out of here.

1011
01:31:31,416 --> 01:31:32,769
ln that.

1012
01:31:47,416 --> 01:31:50,010
Come on, get in there! Go!

1013
01:31:51,536 --> 01:31:53,128
Better hurry up, doc.

1014
01:31:53,296 --> 01:31:55,252
Goddamn it.

1015
01:31:55,416 --> 01:31:58,089
lt's not a clock radio
we're dealing with, okay?

1016
01:32:13,256 --> 01:32:16,168
All right. You're all set.

1017
01:32:17,256 --> 01:32:18,689
Watch yourself.

1018
01:32:19,816 --> 01:32:21,249
Close for Ben.

1019
01:32:23,736 --> 01:32:25,567
Hey! What about me?
Where am l gonna go?

1020
01:32:25,736 --> 01:32:27,613
Head west. l'll cover you.

1021
01:32:27,776 --> 01:32:29,209
West.

1022
01:32:30,736 --> 01:32:33,569
And initiate scramjet sequence.

1023
01:32:41,296 --> 01:32:43,491
Fire on my fire!

1024
01:33:43,216 --> 01:33:44,615
Welcome to Alaska.

1025
01:34:02,976 --> 01:34:05,934
lnvade Primo and find the ejection
coordinates for Lieutenant Wade.

1026
01:34:08,096 --> 01:34:10,894
Lieutenant Wade crashed
1 2. 2 miles from the border.

1027
01:34:11,056 --> 01:34:14,366
South Korea is an ally.
She would head south.

1028
01:34:14,536 --> 01:34:16,174
But we have a problem.

1029
01:34:16,336 --> 01:34:19,328
My stealth functions
were lost in the fire.

1030
01:34:19,696 --> 01:34:22,574
l want you to find
the North Korean radar floor.

1031
01:34:23,616 --> 01:34:25,368
Fifteen feet.

1032
01:34:25,976 --> 01:34:27,932
Well, we can fly in under the radar.

1033
01:34:31,336 --> 01:34:32,815
Continue.

1034
01:34:34,616 --> 01:34:36,652
-Marshfield.
-Captain, this is Lieutenant Gannon.

1035
01:34:36,816 --> 01:34:38,010
Lieutenant, where are you?

1036
01:34:38,176 --> 01:34:41,293
Actually, I'm inside
the UC AV EDI, sir.

1037
01:34:41,456 --> 01:34:45,290
Look, lieutenant, l want you and that
machine back on this ship ASAP.

1038
01:34:45,456 --> 01:34:49,131
I need the status
of Lieutenant Wade first, sir.

1039
01:34:50,936 --> 01:34:53,245
-Ben, l hate to tell you this, but--
-I know.

1040
01:34:53,416 --> 01:34:55,691
Has her survival beacon
been located?

1041
01:34:55,856 --> 01:34:56,971
No, l'm sorry.

1042
01:34:58,416 --> 01:35:00,327
Did Cummings
tell you he would take charge...

1043
01:35:00,496 --> 01:35:02,691
...of the search and rescue
of Lieutenant Wade?

1044
01:35:02,856 --> 01:35:04,414
Well, not exactly, lieutenant. Why?

1045
01:35:04,576 --> 01:35:07,136
Sir, there are a lot of things
I think you should know.

1046
01:35:51,096 --> 01:35:52,449
This is breaking news.

1047
01:35:54,296 --> 01:35:56,810
There was a major explosion
Thursday in Rangoon.

1048
01:35:56,976 --> 01:35:59,171
l'll take care of everything here.
Change course...

1049
01:35:59,336 --> 01:36:01,611
-...and head directly back to the ship.
-Negative.

1050
01:36:01,776 --> 01:36:04,574
She's my wingman.
lf l find her, l'm going in.

1051
01:36:04,736 --> 01:36:07,569
lf you go in, it's war. PAYCOM
says it's gotten way too hot.

1052
01:36:07,736 --> 01:36:09,567
Lieutenant, the best thing
for the Navy...

1053
01:36:09,736 --> 01:36:12,170
...is for you to bring
that aircraft back to this ship.

1054
01:36:12,336 --> 01:36:15,533
No, what's best is what you taught me:
You never abandon your wingman.

1055
01:36:16,976 --> 01:36:19,046
Then listen to me now, son.

1056
01:36:19,216 --> 01:36:23,368
lf you go down, Cummings wins.

1057
01:36:23,696 --> 01:36:26,256
Kara Wade knew the risks
when she took--

1058
01:36:26,416 --> 01:36:28,054
Captain Marshfield?

1059
01:36:28,816 --> 01:36:30,010
Sir?

1060
01:36:32,016 --> 01:36:33,608
EDl, did you just turn him off?

1061
01:36:34,736 --> 01:36:36,613
There was nothing left to say.

1062
01:37:13,136 --> 01:37:15,650
This is a supply line
to the demilitarized zone.

1063
01:37:15,816 --> 01:37:17,772
It will tak e us right to the border.

1064
01:37:48,736 --> 01:37:50,533
What's all this about, Dick?

1065
01:37:50,976 --> 01:37:52,568
l'm placing you under arrest.

1066
01:37:54,656 --> 01:37:57,773
-On what grounds?
-Endangering your squadron...

1067
01:37:57,936 --> 01:38:01,292
...transmitting secure information to a
foreign government, heat signatures...

1068
01:38:01,456 --> 01:38:03,651
...giving false intel
to your commanding officer...

1069
01:38:03,816 --> 01:38:07,695
...and authorizing the assassination
of one of your own pilots.

1070
01:38:09,376 --> 01:38:11,048
Well, that's a lot to prove.

1071
01:38:11,416 --> 01:38:13,168
Yeah, well...

1072
01:38:13,336 --> 01:38:15,372
...with any amount of luck...

1073
01:38:15,536 --> 01:38:19,245
...Lieutenant Gannon
will live to help me.

1074
01:38:21,056 --> 01:38:23,365
-Master-at-arms.
-Dick.

1075
01:38:24,736 --> 01:38:26,089
Hold on.

1076
01:38:30,256 --> 01:38:33,612
Would you mind just giving me
a couple minutes alone?

1077
01:38:35,776 --> 01:38:37,448
Yeah, sure.

1078
01:38:40,296 --> 01:38:41,729
Thank you.

1079
01:38:58,936 --> 01:39:01,769
I'm not available at this time.
Leave a message.

1080
01:39:01,936 --> 01:39:05,167
So it's voice mail now, is it, Ray?

1081
01:39:05,336 --> 01:39:07,850
I've been demoted?

1082
01:39:08,016 --> 01:39:09,210
Well...

1083
01:39:10,296 --> 01:39:12,969
...l'm gonna have to leave you
a little message, Ray.

1084
01:39:18,576 --> 01:39:21,613
And it's gonna be loud and clear.

1085
01:39:26,816 --> 01:39:28,613
Just so you never confuse
the difference...

1086
01:39:28,776 --> 01:39:31,529
...between politicians
and warriors, listen up.

1087
01:43:03,856 --> 01:43:07,371
-We need to take out the tree line.
-This is the last missile.

1088
01:43:28,136 --> 01:43:31,367
There she is. She made it.

1089
01:44:22,296 --> 01:44:23,445
Ben!

1090
01:44:25,016 --> 01:44:26,813
Kara, get down! Get down!

1091
01:44:52,176 --> 01:44:54,087
You came back for me.

1092
01:44:54,816 --> 01:44:56,534
You came back.

1093
01:45:04,896 --> 01:45:06,887
We have to get across
the border. Ready?

1094
01:45:07,056 --> 01:45:08,455
Yeah.

1095
01:45:27,336 --> 01:45:31,727
Go! Go! Whatever you do,
keep going. Keep going! Go!

1096
01:46:04,496 --> 01:46:06,088
Goodbye.

1097
01:46:12,976 --> 01:46:15,126
Come on. Come on.

1098
01:46:39,656 --> 01:46:41,453
They're ours. They're ours.

1099
01:46:41,616 --> 01:46:43,925
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1100
01:46:57,616 --> 01:46:59,129
Come on.

1101
01:47:12,136 --> 01:47:14,730
The souls of the just
are in the hands of God...

1102
01:47:14,896 --> 01:47:17,046
...where no torment
shall touch them.

1103
01:47:17,216 --> 01:47:19,366
Lieutenant Purcell
has passed through...

1104
01:47:19,536 --> 01:47:22,494
...the darkening and turbulent
storms of this life.

1105
01:47:22,656 --> 01:47:27,605
He now rests in peace,
in the fair sunlight of God's presence.

1106
01:47:27,776 --> 01:47:29,846
ln the Navy hymn, we sing:

1107
01:47:30,016 --> 01:47:34,965
'' Lord, guard and guide those who fly
through the great spaces in the sky.''

1108
01:47:35,136 --> 01:47:36,649
And salute!

1109
01:47:52,936 --> 01:47:55,530
Ready. Hut!

1110
01:48:12,416 --> 01:48:13,929
When l was gonna
detach formation...

1111
01:48:14,096 --> 01:48:17,133
...you said you were gonna
tell me something. You remember?

1112
01:48:23,696 --> 01:48:25,129
You and me, we're--

1113
01:48:25,936 --> 01:48:27,335
We're two.

1114
01:48:30,016 --> 01:48:32,405
And two is a prime number...

1115
01:48:32,936 --> 01:48:35,973
...which makes it a lucky number.

1116
01:48:39,536 --> 01:48:42,096
And l think we're very, very lucky.

1117
01:48:58,896 --> 01:49:01,774
Oh, just tell me you love me,
you pussy.
