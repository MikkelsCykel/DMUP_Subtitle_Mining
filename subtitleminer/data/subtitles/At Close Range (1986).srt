Hey, brad! Brad.

He took our money.

00:04:54,444 --> 00:04:56,945
We- We just wanted
a bottle of j.D.,

4
00:04:56,946 --> 00:05:00,450
And he said he'd go in and get it
for us if we gave him the money.

5
00:05:02,452 --> 00:05:05,955
How much money? How much? Five dollars.
He bought himself a bottle of gin.

6
00:05:12,328 --> 00:05:15,715
- Did you take their money?
- Yeah, i took five dollars.

7
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:19,218
I was gonna give this to them, but they're
smart-Ass kids, and now they're not getting it.

8
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:22,722
You'll give it back now? No,
i'm not gonna give it back.

9
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:24,974
You're not gonna
give it back to them?

10
00:05:24,975 --> 00:05:27,226
No, i'm not 'cause
this kid's an asshole.

11
00:05:27,227 --> 00:05:29,227
Which one?
The big one.

12
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:31,230
That's my brother. Yeah.
That's your brother?

13
00:05:31,231 --> 00:05:33,232
Take care of him.
He's too young to drink.

14
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:35,233
Give him the money back.

15
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:37,737
I'm not giving him the money back,
and what are you gonna do about it?

16
00:05:37,738 --> 00:05:39,739
Fuck you
and fuck them.

17
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:46,245
That's what i thought.
Brad?

18
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:55,253
Do you?

19
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:57,256
Get off the car,

20
00:06:00,376 --> 00:06:02,378
You wanna play?

21
00:06:03,379 --> 00:06:05,882
All right.
I can play.

22
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:19,645
Come on. Get off.
All right, kid.

23
00:06:19,896 --> 00:06:22,648
You asked for it.

24
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:25,401
Faster. Come on.

25
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:27,653
Whoa.

26
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,168
Get off,

27
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:54,313
All right, kid, come on.
Get off of the car.

28
00:06:57,817 --> 00:07:01,320
- What do you want?
- The five.

29
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:07,827
Now get off the car,
all right?

30
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,332
Now what do you want?

31
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,835
- The gin.
- I gave you the five.

32
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:22,341
Hey, man, you know,
we got your license plates.

33
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,882
Now will you
get off the car?

34
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:35,388
You're weird, kid.
You know that?

35
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,402
That was
fucking great, man.

36
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:54,407
I liked it. Drink your
gin, get in the truck.

37
00:07:54,408 --> 00:07:57,410
Don't you want
some of this?

38
00:07:57,411 --> 00:07:59,412
Come on, man.

39
00:08:00,997 --> 00:08:04,125
Nice move, man.

40
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:10,756
Hi.

41
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:13,259
Hello.

42
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,762
Is this your friend?

43
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:18,764
Yeah, jill.

44
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:22,268
Jill. Hi, jill.

45
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:24,270
Hi.

46
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:27,273
You got a name?

47
00:08:27,274 --> 00:08:30,775
Brad?

48
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:33,779
You don't sound so sure.

49
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:42,287
Oh, i'm terry.

50
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:44,790
Terry. Hi.

You have
a really nice smile.

52
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,803
Thanks.

53
00:09:14,203 --> 00:09:16,205
Terry doesn't take drugs.

54
00:09:17,206 --> 00:09:19,207
What are they?

55
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:23,212
I don't really know.
They make things stronger.

56
00:09:23,213 --> 00:09:25,714
What is that
supposed to mean?

57
00:09:25,715 --> 00:09:30,219
Whatever you feel, it
makes you feel it stronger.

58
00:09:45,234 --> 00:09:47,236
Brad!

59
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:49,989
Just get her phone number
and come on.

60
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:52,358
Just get
her phone number.

61
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:54,859
Who's that?

62
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,863
My brother and his partner.
I gotta drive them, i guess.

63
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:04,370
Will i see you
down here again?

64
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:08,374
I don't know.

65
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:12,878
Well, where

00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:20,386
Well, i guess i could be

68
00:10:20,387 --> 00:10:22,887
All right.

Ooh-Hoo.

00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:43,793
Did you tell her

74
00:10:44,293 --> 00:10:46,295
J&j&j&j&

75
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,981
The toyota sr-5.

76
00:11:06,982 --> 00:11:08,984
The truck that feels
like a sports car.

77
00:11:09,485 --> 00:11:12,112

Hey, brad.

80
00:11:19,862 --> 00:11:23,866
You're always trying to go out
with those real pretty women.

81
00:11:25,368 --> 00:11:27,370
All they got
is a cunt.

82
00:11:28,871 --> 00:11:30,872
They're all the same.

83
00:11:30,873 --> 00:11:35,378
They tell you they want you
to- To talk nice...

84
00:11:35,878 --> 00:11:38,130
and act nice.

85
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:40,258
Hello!
Yeah, come on in.

86
00:11:40,259 --> 00:11:42,385
All they got is
a goddamned cunt.

87
00:11:58,617 --> 00:12:00,618
What you doing?

88
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:03,989
My truck's
all fucked up.

89
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:08,560
Is she home?

90
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,630
No. No.

91
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:15,634
Now who's that?

92
00:12:22,758 --> 00:12:24,760
I wanna give her
some money.

93
00:12:24,761 --> 00:12:27,262
Goddamn.
Huh?

94
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:29,765
I said,
"she could sure use it."

95
00:12:29,766 --> 00:12:32,268
So, what do you think,
a hundred?

96
00:12:32,768 --> 00:12:35,771
Two, three? What?

97
00:12:38,774 --> 00:12:42,278
Brad.
Yeah.

98
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:44,279
Tommy?

99
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,782
No.

100
00:12:46,783 --> 00:12:48,784
Ah.

101
00:12:50,286 --> 00:12:52,288
See ya.

102
00:12:57,793 --> 00:12:59,795
How old are you now,
anyway?

103
00:12:59,796 --> 00:13:02,264
Old enough.

104
00:13:02,765 --> 00:13:04,266
Damn.

105
00:13:29,124 --> 00:13:31,126
Do you know
where he's living at?

106
00:13:31,627 --> 00:13:34,246
I don't care.

107
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:40,753
He's up in homeville.

108
00:13:50,179 --> 00:13:51,680
Little brad...

109
00:13:53,682 --> 00:13:55,684
don't even think
about it.

110
00:15:08,223 --> 00:15:10,225
Is that my beer
you're drinking?

111
00:15:10,726 --> 00:15:14,229
There's a colt 45.
You can't afford it.

112
00:15:16,732 --> 00:15:19,234
You know, that shit you guys are
smoking is gonna rot your brains,

113
00:15:19,235 --> 00:15:21,737
But i guess in your case, that
ain't no damage done, is it?

114
00:15:40,623 --> 00:15:44,125
Why don't you get a
job, boy? I tried that.

115
00:15:44,126 --> 00:15:47,630
You quit as soon as you paid off that
damn truck, didn't you? That's right.

116
00:15:47,631 --> 00:15:50,132
We ain't all got it so lucky
around here, you know?

117
00:15:50,599 --> 00:15:52,601
You see your mom in there. She's gotta work
in the morning. Your grandma's gotta work.

118
00:15:53,102 --> 00:15:56,055
But more important, i gotta work
tomorrow, and i need some sleep.

119
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:59,525
You turn that damn thing on again,
and i'll beat the jesus out of you.

120
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:04,029
There ain't no jesus
in me.

121
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:07,533
Go to bed, tommy.

122
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:12,537
Look, ernie.
This here is my house.

123
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:16,542
You lived here four years. Before that
rising sun, six, before that, jennersville.

124
00:16:16,543 --> 00:16:19,044
You've been five months with her.
You don't ever tell me what to do.

125
00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:23,165
Ernie. Ernie!

126
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:26,168
All right, enough.

127
00:16:26,169 --> 00:16:28,170
You little son of a-

128
00:17:14,216 --> 00:17:18,187
Yeah, homeville. Number for
bradford whitewood sr., please.

129
00:17:22,191 --> 00:17:25,694
I guess you must have heard
about me or something.

130
00:17:27,196 --> 00:17:29,197
I guess.

131
00:17:29,198 --> 00:17:31,200
What'd you hear?

132
00:17:33,202 --> 00:17:34,703
I heard you was a thief.

133
00:17:35,204 --> 00:17:37,205
What do you think
about that?

134
00:17:37,206 --> 00:17:40,208
Looks like you make
pretty good money at it.

135
00:17:40,209 --> 00:17:43,212
Well, to some folks, i'm just
the devil in blue suede shoes.

136
00:17:43,213 --> 00:17:45,214
Don't you believe it, okay?

137
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:47,215
Okay.

138
00:17:47,216 --> 00:17:50,218
I never stole
nothing, hear?

139
00:17:50,219 --> 00:17:52,221
Yeah. Don't you worry about
getting a speeding ticket?

140
00:17:52,721 --> 00:17:55,224
Kid, you look a thousand
miles any direction...

141
00:17:55,225 --> 00:17:58,226
from tennessee
to toronto,

142
00:17:58,227 --> 00:18:00,228
I go back roads
just about anyplace.

143
00:18:00,229 --> 00:18:03,732
Never touch the interstate.
Never see one goddamn cop.

144
00:18:03,733 --> 00:18:05,734
Besides, this ain't fast.

145
00:18:13,242 --> 00:18:15,244
Hello?

146
00:18:17,746 --> 00:18:19,748
That's my son.

147
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,253
It's brad.

148
00:18:24,753 --> 00:18:26,755
He'll be staying

A few weeks.

00:18:46,775 --> 00:18:49,761
They're sort of
part of the family.

155
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:54,283
And, uh,

157
00:18:56,786 --> 00:18:58,787
Hi, brad jr.

158
00:18:59,288 --> 00:19:01,907
Mary sue's about five
years older than you.

159
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:07,796
- You're own family.
- We're late.

160
00:19:17,806 --> 00:19:21,310
Mary sue, show him
that room we got.

161
00:19:21,311 --> 00:19:23,312
Hell, he's cute.

162
00:19:25,315 --> 00:19:27,316
See you tomorrow.

163
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:42,080
I didn't know
you had a son, brad.

164
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:44,582
Got two.
Sort of.

165
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:49,087
Old braddy went to prison. Julie started
dickin' some grease monkey from willerton.

166
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:52,090
Nine months later,
out popped tommy.

167
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:57,095
What exactly
are you saying?

168
00:19:57,596 --> 00:20:01,099
Nothing. Nothing.
I didn't say nothing.

169
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,101
Just one thing here.

170
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:06,605
You don't say nothing
against the family.

171
00:20:06,606 --> 00:20:09,106
Okay.

172
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:11,610
Let's go to work.

173
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:16,615
So, uh, where'd
they go, anyway?

174
00:20:31,747 --> 00:20:34,750
One's coming.

175
00:20:38,387 --> 00:20:39,888
Okay, i hear it.

176
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,023
Patch, what's that car?

177
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:38,030
Brad.

178
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:43,785
Brad, we lost our lookout. Yo.

179
00:21:44,286 --> 00:21:45,904
I think your brother's out there
pinching hubcaps or something.

180
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:48,540
I'll stay
where i can hear you.

181
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:11,930
- Hundreds?
- Twenties.

182
00:22:36,338 --> 00:22:39,341
You remind me of a guy
i knew in high school.

183
00:22:41,343 --> 00:22:44,346
Only he was
a real doofus.

184
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:50,352
Go for a ride?

185
00:22:50,353 --> 00:22:52,353
Sure.

186
00:22:52,354 --> 00:22:56,858
Gimme that foot.
Gimme those little piggies.

187
00:22:56,859 --> 00:22:58,860
Mmm.

188
00:23:04,366 --> 00:23:06,368
Time to do some laundry.

189
00:23:29,391 --> 00:23:31,393
Kid, you like pussy?

190
00:23:31,893 --> 00:23:34,395
Yeah.
Smart boy.

191
00:23:34,396 --> 00:23:36,898
What's the sexiest thing you ever
thought of in your whole life?

192
00:23:37,399 --> 00:23:38,900
Excuse me. Can i help you? Yeah.

193
00:23:39,401 --> 00:23:42,404
You got- You got, what,
$5,500 on that car?

194
00:23:43,772 --> 00:23:47,275
I'll give you five...
cash.

195
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,496
Do i drive her out?

196
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:23,028
What are we doing here?

197
00:24:23,029 --> 00:24:25,030
Laundry.

198
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:34,539
You know that truck of mine's
gone punk dead.

199
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:38,543
I could sure use a slick
car sometime. Maybe.

200
00:24:38,544 --> 00:24:42,047
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Yeah.

201
00:24:42,048 --> 00:24:44,549
I just bought
this car...

202
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:46,551
for 5,500.

203
00:24:46,552 --> 00:24:48,552
It's a cherry.

204
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:52,174
- Would you give me 46 for her?
- Why are you selling it?

205
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:55,427
I don't like the radio.

206
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:21,786
You're kidding.
No.

207
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:25,790
Mom said, "that's my son.
Nobody touches my son."

208
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:28,293
And she threw his suitcase
down the stairs.

209
00:25:28,294 --> 00:25:30,295
I wish i'd seen that.

210
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:36,300
Brad, when are you
gonna come home?

211
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:38,803
I don't know. I'm hoping
dad might give me something.

212
00:25:39,304 --> 00:25:41,306
Yeah? What?

213
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:48,313
Hey, jill. Jill.
Hey, terry's friend.

214
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:28,163
Hi. Hi.

215
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:31,416
You scared the hell out of me. Sorry.

216
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:33,801
Well, thanks
for coming out.

217
00:27:33,802 --> 00:27:36,054
I can only stay
a minute.

218
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:39,057
Oh, well,
your friend, jill,

219
00:27:39,557 --> 00:27:41,559
Didn't know if you wanted
to come out at all.

220
00:27:41,926 --> 00:27:43,678
Jill.

221
00:27:50,819 --> 00:27:52,821
So, you do
remember me, huh?

222
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:56,825
- Sure.
- You were supposed to meet me, you know, that night.

223
00:27:56,826 --> 00:27:59,327
I know. My mother
wouldn't let me out.

224
00:27:59,694 --> 00:28:04,198
And then i tried to sneak out,
and she caught me.

225
00:28:04,199 --> 00:28:08,703
Really? Yeah. She
grounded me for two weeks.

226
00:28:10,705 --> 00:28:13,091
She says until i'm 17,
i can only go out-

227
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:17,712
- You're only 16?
- Yeah, so?

228
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:23,468
I thought about
your smile a lot.

229
00:28:23,718 --> 00:28:27,222
I thought about you too.

230
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:34,479
Jill says
your last name's whitewood?

231
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,481
Yeah.

232
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:40,984
Your father's
got kind of a rep.

233
00:28:40,985 --> 00:28:44,805
Well, yeah. Don't believe
everything you hear.

234
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:48,625
- Terry.
- Oh, shit. I gotta go.

235
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:54,132
Wait a minute. Jill didn't
give me your number or anything.

236
00:28:54,133 --> 00:28:57,134
555-6239.

237
00:28:57,135 --> 00:29:00,137
555-6239.
Three-Nine.

238
00:29:00,138 --> 00:29:02,140
Yeah, okay. Wait. Don't go yet.

239
00:29:02,141 --> 00:29:04,392
Um-
Terry?

240
00:29:04,393 --> 00:29:06,644
I gotta go.

241
00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:20,158
Bye.

242
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:25,130
Ha!

243
00:29:34,589 --> 00:29:38,092
Hey, patch, how come you
don't go out with them anymore?

244
00:29:40,094 --> 00:29:42,096
The other guys.

245
00:29:43,598 --> 00:29:46,100
'Cause your daddy's
a dickface.

246
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:49,220
Don't want me
having no money.

247
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:52,222
Don't want me
having no fun.

248
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:55,226
One day, i'm
gonna have my own empire.

249
00:29:56,728 --> 00:29:59,229
I'm gonna steal
everything.

250
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:02,232
- Wanna help me?
- I don't know.

251
00:30:02,233 --> 00:30:05,737
Sure you can. You ever
steal a police car?

252
00:30:05,987 --> 00:30:09,374
No.

253
00:30:09,375 --> 00:30:11,375
Me neither.

254
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:14,379
Hey, we could steal a whole
lot of stuff, you and me.

255
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:18,883
There's no sense sitting around a
dump like this, wasting our time.

256
00:30:18,884 --> 00:30:21,886
I heard that. I mean, there's
a world out there waiting.

257
00:30:21,887 --> 00:30:23,887
Tell you what.

258
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:27,892
Let's you and me
go in the next room...

259
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:32,397
and start sniffing
some ideas.

260
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:34,399
Let's go.

261
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:41,523
"Ideas" is
my middle name.

262
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:54,285
What do you think?

263
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:56,421
It's fuckin' beautiful.

264
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:58,923
It's a piece of shit,
but it's yours.

265
00:31:00,925 --> 00:31:04,428
Is it legal?
Yes, it's legal.

266
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:06,931
There's parts on it
borrowed, but...

267
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:11,435
registration's clean.

268
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:13,937
Don't never say
i done nothing for you.

269
00:31:13,938 --> 00:31:17,308
Just don't know
if i could ever pay you back.

270
00:31:23,314 --> 00:31:26,317
Try this.
Stay clear of my brother.

271
00:31:26,318 --> 00:31:28,820
Which one?

272
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,823
You know damn well,
boy.

273
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:38,796
Okay. It's a good way for me to make some
money, you know? It's something i can do.

274
00:31:39,297 --> 00:31:41,549
You two jackasses,
you'll both end up in jail.

275
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:43,800
Then, you teach me.
You show me what to do.

276
00:31:43,801 --> 00:31:47,805
If i'm gonna learn, i should learn
right, from you. I got no time.

277
00:31:48,306 --> 00:31:50,558
Just to show me?

278
00:31:51,059 --> 00:31:52,543
Don't seem right.

279
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:56,014
Come on, dad.
I get some guys together.

280
00:31:56,015 --> 00:31:58,016
I don't know.
We'll see.

281
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:06,274
You better go on home.

282
00:32:06,275 --> 00:32:09,152
To your mother's.
Yeah.

283
00:32:09,153 --> 00:32:12,030
I don't know why, but...

284
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:15,533
you make mary sue
awful skittish.

285
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:53,571
Five. I'm going to bed.

286
00:32:53,572 --> 00:32:55,572
Ten, eleven,
two, three- Wait!

287
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:59,577
Wait, wait. Julie,
wait. You've got- Mom.

288
00:32:59,578 --> 00:33:03,081
Okay, she left.
Hold on. Six, seven.

289
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:06,084
Six plus five... is eleven. Is 11.

290
00:33:06,085 --> 00:33:08,086
One, two, three, four...

291
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:11,089
five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten, eleven.

292
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:14,091
My property.
No problem.

293
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:16,344
Now we're gonna split
her property up.

294
00:33:16,345 --> 00:33:18,722
I'll take boardwalk and park place. No.

295
00:33:18,723 --> 00:33:21,098
You can take-
No, i want boardwalk.

296
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:24,102
No, see, grandma,
if you take this property,

297
00:33:24,602 --> 00:33:27,797
You'll have a hotel on each, and
there's better odds of landing on it.

298
00:33:27,798 --> 00:33:30,992
No, i want boardwalk. 'Cause there's
three of them and there's only-

299
00:33:38,499 --> 00:33:41,501
Big brad, you know,

300
00:33:41,502 --> 00:33:45,506
When i married him, he had
the biggest eyes you ever saw,

301
00:33:45,507 --> 00:33:48,009
And he courted me
like a regular gentleman.

302
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:51,512
With flowers
and everything.

303
00:33:53,514 --> 00:33:56,017
Good night,
little brad.

304
00:33:56,018 --> 00:33:58,019
Good night.

305
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:13,984
Hey, brad.
Are you awake?

306
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:17,488
There's a girl on the phone.

307
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:39,644
I'd better get you home before
your mother starts to worry.

308
00:34:42,146 --> 00:34:44,148
It's nice to meet you.
Likewise.

309
00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:46,517
Good-Bye.

310
00:35:08,506 --> 00:35:10,508
What's he like?

311
00:35:13,511 --> 00:35:15,513
Who?

312
00:36:02,226 --> 00:36:05,229
J&j&j&j&

313
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:07,849
Find one there.

314
00:36:09,851 --> 00:36:11,853
Find one right there.

315
00:36:12,854 --> 00:36:14,856
Back in there too.

316
00:36:17,742 --> 00:36:19,993
How can you tell?

317
00:36:19,994 --> 00:36:23,497
Size of the lawn,
size of the stroke.

318
00:36:24,498 --> 00:36:27,434
Regular mower cuts
about a foot wide.

319
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:30,371
Good tractor
do you three or four.

320
00:36:31,873 --> 00:36:34,876
See, most people
that drive through here,

321
00:36:34,877 --> 00:36:37,377
They see farms,

322
00:36:37,378 --> 00:36:40,881
Houses and fields
and shit.

323
00:36:40,882 --> 00:36:43,384
I see money. Everywhere
i go i see money.

324
00:36:43,885 --> 00:36:48,389
I see things that can move. Anything
can move, it's got my name written on it.

325
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:51,893
"Brad whitewood, please hold
for the delivery."

326
00:36:53,394 --> 00:36:59,149
- My name too.
- Yeah, little bastard.

327
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:04,288
Oh, wait, i forgot.
You's the bastard, ain't ya?

328
00:37:04,538 --> 00:37:07,408
Hey.

329
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:10,543
I didn't mean
nothing by it.

330
00:37:10,544 --> 00:37:13,547
I swear i didn't mean
nothing by it.

331
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:22,807
One day, you know what?
You know what i'm gonna do?

332
00:37:25,426 --> 00:37:27,812
Give you guys a present.

333
00:37:39,941 --> 00:37:42,944
What do you think
of that?

334
00:37:43,077 --> 00:37:45,079
Looks like
a pretty nice gun.

335
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:48,082
Fuckin' a-Plus,
it's a nice gun.

336
00:37:48,083 --> 00:37:52,119
It's 350, retail.

337
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:59,427
I got a good price on mine.
Real good. Wanna touch it?

338
00:37:59,428 --> 00:38:01,429
Can i?
Is that all right?

339
00:38:08,436 --> 00:38:11,973
- Do you like it?
- I like it a lot.

340
00:38:11,974 --> 00:38:13,975
You can't have it.
It's mine.

341
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:28,121
I already
give you a car.

342
00:38:28,122 --> 00:38:32,126
That don't mean nothing. I
gotta see something in you.

343
00:38:32,127 --> 00:38:36,113
I gotta see you got
something... right here...

344
00:38:37,131 --> 00:38:40,050
between the legs,

345
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:43,036
Then i'll give you
a real present.

346
00:38:43,037 --> 00:38:45,556
You wanna
see we got something?

347
00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:49,560
We'll show you something. We'll
show you something tonight.

348
00:38:49,561 --> 00:38:52,930
Yeah? Hey, brad.

349
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:56,817
How's it going?

350
00:38:58,436 --> 00:39:01,939
- These your new recruits?
- These are my sons, lester.

351
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:04,442
Oh, well,

352
00:39:04,942 --> 00:39:08,446
You boys have
a very interesting family.

353
00:39:08,696 --> 00:39:11,197
Get out of my face,
lester.

354
00:39:11,198 --> 00:39:14,702
For instance, remember when
we stole those muskets...

355
00:39:14,703 --> 00:39:16,804
from the
revolutionary war museum?

356
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:20,791
Of course, dickie conked out
that, uh, janitor, making it...

357
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:23,044
grand larceny,
aggravated assault.

358
00:39:23,045 --> 00:39:25,296
But it was a good time,
right, brad?

359
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:30,800
Oh, yeah, you're smart.

360
00:39:30,801 --> 00:39:34,304
You don't wanna talk to me.
Come on, brad.

361
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:38,359
I wanna work with you again.
I need some of that action.

362
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:41,361
Why, so you can tell
the cops?

363
00:39:41,362 --> 00:39:45,366
Cops? Ain't so
bad. Just doing their job.

364
00:39:45,866 --> 00:39:48,869
Just kidding.

365
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:56,293
Okay, i know.
I'm going.

366
00:39:56,794 --> 00:40:00,297
I'm going. I'm gone.

367
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:08,756
The boy ain't got the life
expectancy of a housefly.

368
00:40:20,768 --> 00:40:23,270
J&j&j&j&

369
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:01,859
Like this one time, patch goes
into this jewelry store, right?

370
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:04,360
He asks to see
this $500 watch.

371
00:41:04,361 --> 00:41:06,171
So, the lady,
she shows it to him, all right,

372
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:07,982
But she don't wanna take
her paws off it.

373
00:41:08,482 --> 00:41:10,984
He's tuggin' one direction,
she's tuggin' the other direction.

374
00:41:10,985 --> 00:41:14,989
Finally, pulls up his sleeve, he
goes, "lady, mine's worth a thousand.

375
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:16,991
Why the hell
would i want yours?"

376
00:41:17,374 --> 00:41:21,245
This makes sense to her, right? So,
she takes her hands off the thing.

377
00:41:21,246 --> 00:41:23,747
He grabs the son of a bitch and
hightails it out of the store.

378
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:27,251
Shit! Something's coming.

379
00:41:57,031 --> 00:41:59,533
J&j& oh, what a feeling j&j&

380
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:02,919
J&j& don't stop j&j&
j&j& oh, what a feeling j&j&

381
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:06,423
J&j& tomorrow, tomorrow j&j& j&j&
oh, oh, oh, oh, what a feeling j&j&

382
00:42:06,924 --> 00:42:09,927
J&j& toyota j&j&j&j&

383
00:42:27,761 --> 00:42:30,314
J&j&j&j&

384
00:42:44,328 --> 00:42:47,831
Hurry up! We gotta get this
stuff to a truck stop before dawn.

385
00:42:47,832 --> 00:42:50,584
Yo, brad! Yo!

386
00:42:50,585 --> 00:42:53,336
Telephone!
All right.

387
00:42:53,337 --> 00:42:57,341
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty,
kitty. You're one to talk. Hey!

388
00:43:03,347 --> 00:43:05,849
Make it spicy, rose.

389
00:43:11,355 --> 00:43:13,357
Yo, what you got?

390
00:43:13,741 --> 00:43:15,743
Shot.
Say again.

391
00:43:16,243 --> 00:43:18,746
Shot. I got shot, man.
Birdshot in the face.

392
00:43:19,246 --> 00:43:22,249
Bad?
Well, it hurts.

393
00:43:24,752 --> 00:43:27,755
- Get any tractors?
- No.

394
00:43:30,257 --> 00:43:34,762
- Go on home, then.
- I can't. Not with my face like this.

395
00:43:35,262 --> 00:43:38,265
You can't go to my place
if that's what you're asking.

396
00:43:38,766 --> 00:43:41,268
Mary sue, me, we're here,
we're helping out... late.

397
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:45,271
Be at it all night.

398
00:43:45,272 --> 00:43:48,275
Can i come
where you're at?

399
00:43:49,777 --> 00:43:51,779
You got a woman...

400
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:54,782
someplace.

401
00:44:35,989 --> 00:44:39,443
I want you both downstairs
with your clothes on in five minutes.

402
00:44:39,943 --> 00:44:41,945
Do you hear me, terry?

403
00:45:22,736 --> 00:45:24,738
Whoo!

404
00:47:08,475 --> 00:47:10,477
Sorry.

405
00:47:19,019 --> 00:47:21,021
Hey.

406
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:26,777
Wake up.

407
00:47:37,287 --> 00:47:41,825
You know, i know my mom.
She's not gonna sit there.

408
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:46,263
She's gonna call the cops
after me.

409
00:47:55,255 --> 00:47:57,307
I mean,
what are we gonna do?

410
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:02,696
We got $18 left.

411
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:09,486
I'm gonna have to
go home.

412
00:48:23,550 --> 00:48:25,535
Listen.

413
00:48:29,056 --> 00:48:32,625
If we can sometime,

414
00:48:32,626 --> 00:48:35,311
You wanna go somewhere?

415
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:37,381
Get our own place
together?

416
00:48:40,634 --> 00:48:42,853
Okay.

417
00:48:44,354 --> 00:48:46,356
You mean it?

418
00:48:47,357 --> 00:48:49,076
Sure.

419
00:48:51,478 --> 00:48:53,530
I mean it.
Okay.

420
00:48:54,581 --> 00:48:57,684
It might take a little while,
but i can do it.

421
00:48:59,703 --> 00:49:01,871
How?

422
00:49:01,872 --> 00:49:04,675
Don't worry about it.
I'll take care of it.

423
00:49:04,676 --> 00:49:06,677
I worry about it.

424
00:49:11,665 --> 00:49:16,603

was the most beautiful woman
you guys ever seen in your life.

429
00:49:39,994 --> 00:49:44,497
Mm-Hmm. Beautiful? She was a hooker.

430
00:49:44,498 --> 00:49:50,504
She wasn't a hooker.
She was a... architect.

431
00:49:50,505 --> 00:49:52,505
J&j& oh, boogie j&j&

Listen, terry? That's patch. Yeah.

What'd you hear?

00:52:03,887 --> 00:52:05,889
Different things.

Dad, we wanna talk to you

00:52:26,543 --> 00:52:30,046
We wanna get a place like that.
It's gonna cost some real money.

474
00:52:31,548 --> 00:52:33,550
So, i wanna join up
with you guys.

475
00:52:35,302 --> 00:52:37,304
Just temporarily.

476
00:52:54,821 --> 00:52:56,822
Fine. Fine.

477
00:52:56,823 --> 00:52:59,325
You don't have to
let him in.

478
00:52:59,326 --> 00:53:02,329
But you know,
he's better than you.

479
00:53:22,966 --> 00:53:25,468
Would you excuse us?

480
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:28,972
It's all right.

481
00:53:36,730 --> 00:53:39,732
That's not right.

482
00:53:39,733 --> 00:53:43,236
You wanna talk to me?
You talk to me in private.

483
00:53:43,237 --> 00:53:46,740
I'll tell you something.
That girl is trouble.

484
00:53:46,741 --> 00:53:49,241
She's nice, she's young,
big mouth.

485
00:53:49,242 --> 00:53:52,746
You stick with us. You stick by
me. You can see this is a group.

486
00:53:52,747 --> 00:53:54,748
You know,
you don't violate that.

487
00:53:57,250 --> 00:53:59,251
Take her home.

488
00:53:59,252 --> 00:54:02,638
Don't ever do that again.

489
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:06,142
Okay? Don't worry about it.
It's okay.

490
00:54:06,143 --> 00:54:08,144
And look.

491
00:54:11,648 --> 00:54:13,650
Everything
will work out fine.

492
00:54:14,651 --> 00:54:16,653
Yeah.

493
00:54:18,154 --> 00:54:20,657
Okay.

494
00:54:21,157 --> 00:54:22,659
Sorry.

495
00:54:39,426 --> 00:54:41,928
Go ahead.
What else?

496
00:54:43,430 --> 00:54:46,933
Well, this group of guys,
whatever you call it...

497
00:54:48,435 --> 00:54:51,938
goes all over the country, huh? Yeah.

498
00:54:51,939 --> 00:54:54,941
And it's organized?

499
00:54:54,942 --> 00:54:57,943
Organized?
Yeah.

500
00:54:57,944 --> 00:55:00,447
Enough.
It's just guys, you know.

501
00:55:00,947 --> 00:55:03,949
I know guys,
and tony pine knows some.

502
00:55:03,950 --> 00:55:05,952
Boyd, my brothers,
everybody knows some people.

503
00:55:05,953 --> 00:55:08,455
These people
know people.

504
00:55:08,456 --> 00:55:10,956
Before you know it,

505
00:55:10,957 --> 00:55:12,959
You know everybody you gotta
know to get the job done.

506
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:14,961
That's it.

507
00:55:16,463 --> 00:55:18,464
How do you keep cops
off your ass?

508
00:55:18,465 --> 00:55:21,968
I got a friend
who reads the police memos.

509
00:55:21,969 --> 00:55:25,471
For instance, they
just got this report...

510
00:55:25,472 --> 00:55:29,476
there's more tractors stolen in
maryland, delaware, pennsylvania-

511
00:55:29,477 --> 00:55:32,979
That's us- Than all the
other 47 states together.

512
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:36,483
Makes the cops around here
kinda peppy, so...

513
00:55:36,484 --> 00:55:38,985
we lay off tractors
for a while.

514
00:55:38,986 --> 00:55:40,987
Anything else?

515
00:55:43,606 --> 00:55:47,077
Why are you letting me ask you
all this? 'Cause you gotta know.

516
00:55:47,577 --> 00:55:50,080
I gotta make sure you walk
into this with your eyes wide...

517
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:53,083
and know what you're doing
and who you're with.

518
00:55:55,085 --> 00:55:57,587
Especially, you know,
it's a family situation.

519
00:56:05,428 --> 00:56:07,430
You go out with us
once or twice.

520
00:56:07,431 --> 00:56:09,431
See how it is,
then you decide.

521
00:56:09,432 --> 00:56:13,937
If you still want it-
'Cause if you do, that's it.

522
00:56:15,438 --> 00:56:18,441
It's blood.
Don't break it.

523
00:56:40,576 --> 00:56:43,579
Don't want none.
Here you go, dickie.

524
00:57:31,994 --> 00:57:34,813
The caretaker's light
just went on.

525
00:57:34,814 --> 00:57:37,633
Okay, don't move at all!
Don't move.

526
00:57:56,152 --> 00:57:58,654
Good.
Good goin', kid.

527
00:58:03,125 --> 00:58:05,127
Bye-Bye.

528
00:58:06,629 --> 00:58:08,815
Go, go, go!

529
00:58:08,915 --> 00:58:11,918
You know
what? I've been thinking.

530
00:58:11,919 --> 00:58:14,920
I oughta sign up
at the university.

531
00:58:14,921 --> 00:58:16,923
Hey, that's a real good idea,
patch. That's real swift.

532
00:58:17,423 --> 00:58:21,677
No, no, no, no, no. Take
one of them art courses.

533
00:58:21,678 --> 00:58:25,056
We go into a joint like that,
must be t-T-Trillions-

534
00:58:25,057 --> 00:58:28,434
Hundreds of trillions of dollars
hanging on the wall.

535
00:58:28,568 --> 00:58:31,070
And we're too dumb
to know which ones to take.

536
00:58:31,571 --> 00:58:34,574
Take the ugly ones. Uglier
they are, more they're worth.

537
00:58:34,575 --> 00:58:36,576
That's right.

538
00:58:44,584 --> 00:58:47,086
What? You showed me something tonight.

539
00:58:47,587 --> 00:58:49,589
What?
My own blood.

540
00:58:50,089 --> 00:58:51,958
Am i right?

541
00:58:55,845 --> 00:58:59,849

01:00:56,466 --> 01:00:58,968
And we want you to feel

You can't

573
01:01:48,435 --> 01:01:51,437
You used to be a member

589
01:02:44,990 --> 01:02:47,992
I don't know. Guess you're
just a real good friend.

590
01:02:47,993 --> 01:02:52,998
I don't feel
too good. I drank too much.

591

Better pull over.
Pull over by this tree.

Hey, it's a steady job.

01:06:43,063 --> 01:06:45,064
Yeah.
Hurry up.

629
01:06:51,570 --> 01:06:53,572
Goin' out tonight.

630
01:06:55,574 --> 01:06:57,576
Be by around midnight.

631
01:07:06,085 --> 01:07:09,588
What's the damage? Twenty-Five? Forty.

632
01:07:09,589 --> 01:07:11,841
Yeah?
Forty.

633
01:07:11,842 --> 01:07:14,093
You a born thief.

634
01:07:25,104 --> 01:07:27,606
You crazy.
You know, you crazy.

635
01:07:33,612 --> 01:07:36,615
Lookin' good,
julie whitewood!

636
01:07:36,616 --> 01:07:39,118
Tired old bag of shit.

637
01:07:42,121 --> 01:07:44,123
You like that car?
You wanna sit in that car?

638
01:07:44,124 --> 01:07:47,126
Is it all right?
Go on, sit in it.

639
01:07:47,626 --> 01:07:49,628
All right.

640
01:07:54,133 --> 01:07:57,136
I'm not goin' out tonight.

641
01:07:57,636 --> 01:08:01,140
What?
I'm not gonna go out anymore.

642
01:08:08,013 --> 01:08:11,516
You wanna live
in a dump like this?

643
01:08:11,517 --> 01:08:15,019
Workin' ten hours a day
in a cannery?

644
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:20,025
I thought you were like me.
I thought you wanted something.

645
01:08:20,026 --> 01:08:22,994
A car,

646
01:08:22,995 --> 01:08:26,498
Nice girl sittin' in your lap,
money in your pocket.

647
01:08:26,999 --> 01:08:29,001
You said i could go out
and then decide, right?

648
01:08:29,501 --> 01:08:32,003
You scared?

649
01:08:32,004 --> 01:08:35,007
I got somethin' else.
Somethin' or somebody?

650
01:08:35,507 --> 01:08:40,011
Yeah, terry and i
are gettin' outta here.

651
01:08:40,012 --> 01:08:42,514
Where you gonna go? What are you
gonna do when you get where you go?

652
01:08:42,515 --> 01:08:44,883
I got some ideas.

653
01:08:48,387 --> 01:08:51,389
How you gonna pay?

654
01:08:51,390 --> 01:08:53,892
Apartment, food, clothes.

655
01:08:54,393 --> 01:08:56,395
All that.
I'll find something.

656
01:08:58,397 --> 01:09:02,651
You'll find shit! All
you know is how to steal.

657
01:09:02,652 --> 01:09:06,905
You're too fuckin' dumb
to do that by yourself.

658
01:09:06,906 --> 01:09:10,409
Oh, you think so?
I know so.

659
01:09:10,909 --> 01:09:14,413
You'll come back, crawlin' back to
me, "daddy, daddy, give me somethin'."

660
01:09:14,414 --> 01:09:17,166
Well, we'll see. We'll
see. Yeah, we'll see, yep.

661
01:09:40,155 --> 01:09:42,241
What's the matter?

662
01:09:47,779 --> 01:09:51,783
Tell me about your uncle.

663
01:09:52,284 --> 01:09:56,788
Your uncle. Will he
really take us?

664
01:09:57,289 --> 01:09:58,790
Sure.

665
01:10:01,793 --> 01:10:04,846
What's it like there?
What does it look like?

666
01:10:11,853 --> 01:10:14,856
It's called
the big sky country,

667
01:10:14,857 --> 01:10:17,859
'Cause the land goes on forever,

668
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:22,364
Lookin' out 20 miles one way,
50 in the other.

669
01:10:24,666 --> 01:10:26,767
And they got jobs there too.

670
01:10:26,768 --> 01:10:30,739
My cousin's husband, rollie,
he's got a job in billings,

671
01:10:30,740 --> 01:10:34,743
And he's about as dumb
as a dog or something.

672
01:10:37,246 --> 01:10:39,748
You know what else they got?

673
01:10:40,249 --> 01:10:43,802
My cousin- She's just two years
older than me, and she's got a baby.

674
01:10:47,422 --> 01:10:50,926
It's got little tiny feet
and little hands,

675
01:10:51,426 --> 01:10:53,428
And it laughs already.

676
01:10:53,929 --> 01:10:56,949
It probably talks now, but when
i was there, it was just laughing.

677
01:10:56,950 --> 01:10:58,750
It was so tiny.

678
01:11:05,190 --> 01:11:07,192
I guess i love you, huh?

679
01:11:26,511 --> 01:11:29,014
So,

680
01:11:29,514 --> 01:11:31,516
What do you think?

681
01:11:32,517 --> 01:11:37,506
I don't know.
It- It seems-

682
01:11:37,507 --> 01:11:39,524
It's a little big.

683
01:11:40,525 --> 01:11:43,027
Who cares if it's
a fucked-Up idea?

684
01:11:43,028 --> 01:11:46,531
If we get away with it, we score big,
right? Look, it's not a fucked-Up idea.

685
01:11:46,532 --> 01:11:50,535
All we have to do is get in and
out of there as fast as possible.

686
01:11:54,539 --> 01:11:56,541
Okay?

687
01:11:58,543 --> 01:12:00,796
Okay.

688
01:12:23,819 --> 01:12:26,821
Ahh!

689
01:12:26,822 --> 01:12:29,824
Ah, come on, there's a car!

690
01:12:29,825 --> 01:12:32,326
Oh, shit. Somebody's
coming. Come on, let's go.

691
01:12:32,327 --> 01:12:35,330
Tommy, come on, help tim get
these ramps. Get the crowbar.

692
01:12:35,331 --> 01:12:37,833
Where the fuck is it?
Aggie! Come on!

693
01:12:38,083 --> 01:12:41,586
- Get a load of this, man.
- Come on, the car!

694
01:12:41,587 --> 01:12:43,588
I gotta have her!
Let's go!

695
01:12:48,710 --> 01:12:51,213
Come on!
Isn't she beautiful?

696
01:12:52,714 --> 01:12:56,218
Let go, man! Get in!
Close the door and shut it!

697
01:13:02,724 --> 01:13:04,726
Fuck it! Come on!

698
01:13:24,246 --> 01:13:27,249
Now i want you to climb down
from there very slowly. Fuck!

699
01:13:58,163 --> 01:14:00,664
Okay, bailed out:

700
01:14:00,665 --> 01:14:06,588
Essex, milton,
smithson and whitewood, t.

701
01:14:10,592 --> 01:14:12,594
Go on.

702
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:08,682
You here to shut this down?

703
01:15:08,683 --> 01:15:11,686
Maybe next week. What
do you want, whitewood?

704
01:15:11,687 --> 01:15:14,189
I put 500 on that gray one.

705
01:15:14,190 --> 01:15:16,691
Ho, ho,
that's a shrewd bet.

706
01:15:19,194 --> 01:15:22,196
What's my son sayin'?
Nothin'.

707
01:15:22,197 --> 01:15:26,201
Yeah? But they haven't
really started on him yet.

708
01:15:27,702 --> 01:15:31,206
What about the f.B.I.?
They really bring 'em in?

709
01:15:31,207 --> 01:15:33,207
Mm-Hmm, last month.

710
01:15:33,208 --> 01:15:35,710
Grand jury?
Mm-Hmm. Mm-Hmm.

711
01:15:37,212 --> 01:15:40,215
What they got?
Not much so far.

712
01:15:40,216 --> 01:15:43,218
I'm sure they'll
find something.

713
01:15:43,718 --> 01:15:45,220
Maybe a body
or two, hmm?

714
01:15:49,724 --> 01:15:53,728
Can i make a donation?
A political somethin'?

715
01:15:53,729 --> 01:15:57,732
No, not now.
It's too hot.

716
01:15:57,733 --> 01:16:01,736
Oh, your bird lost.
So he did.

717
01:16:09,628 --> 01:16:12,130
Maybe next week, hmm? If
they don't get anything more.

718
01:16:12,131 --> 01:16:14,883
Yeah?
Yeah, we'll see.

719
01:16:14,884 --> 01:16:17,636
If they do... get more?

720
01:16:41,242 --> 01:16:44,496
Hi, is mr. Whitewood here?
M- My name's terry.

721
01:16:46,448 --> 01:16:48,450
It's okay.

722
01:16:54,956 --> 01:16:56,958
Thanks.

723
01:17:02,714 --> 01:17:07,217
Um, i was planning
to go see brad,

724
01:17:07,218 --> 01:17:11,723
And, uh, his mother can't go till
the weekend 'cause she's working.

725
01:17:11,724 --> 01:17:15,226
So i was wondering
if-If you're planning to go.

726
01:17:20,231 --> 01:17:22,734
Maybe.

727
01:17:23,234 --> 01:17:25,737
Well, if you do go,

728
01:17:26,237 --> 01:17:30,241
Um, do you mind
if i go with you?

729
01:17:30,242 --> 01:17:32,243
I don't see why not.

730
01:17:32,744 --> 01:17:36,748
You've done a lot for my boy. I hope so.

731
01:17:39,751 --> 01:17:42,754
You changed him.
Thank you.

732
01:17:45,256 --> 01:17:49,260
What i don't get is why
they let everybody else out,

733
01:17:49,261 --> 01:17:51,763
And they set
brad's bail so high.

734
01:17:54,265 --> 01:17:56,266
I don't get it.

735
01:17:56,267 --> 01:18:00,271
They figure,
if he's in there long enough,

736
01:18:00,272 --> 01:18:04,275
We'll know what he's saying. About what?

737
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:11,282
Oh.

738
01:18:15,870 --> 01:18:19,874
Mm.

739
01:18:22,010 --> 01:18:24,462
You want some corn flakes?

740
01:18:25,964 --> 01:18:27,965
No, thanks.

741
01:18:33,104 --> 01:18:35,607
You scared, kid?
Of what?

742
01:18:36,107 --> 01:18:38,609
A bunch of tractor thieves?

743
01:18:38,610 --> 01:18:42,614
What do you owe those guys?
What'd they ever do for you?

744
01:18:43,114 --> 01:18:45,116
What'd your father
ever do for you?

745
01:18:46,618 --> 01:18:49,621
I don't talk
against my family.

746
01:18:55,660 --> 01:18:57,662
Hello?

747
01:19:15,930 --> 01:19:21,436
Uh, look, uh,
do me a favor.

748
01:19:21,437 --> 01:19:25,439
That's 12,000 cash.

749
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:28,443
Tell brad that- He don't want it.

750
01:19:30,078 --> 01:19:32,079
Let him decide.

751
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:34,115
I said he don't want it.

752
01:19:37,285 --> 01:19:39,788
- Wow, that's a really nice cake.
- Has it got a file in it?

753
01:19:40,288 --> 01:19:42,791
Yeah.

754
01:19:44,793 --> 01:19:47,795
I didn't-
I didn't even know you-

755
01:19:47,796 --> 01:19:49,798
I didn't know you guys
knew each other really.

756
01:19:50,298 --> 01:19:53,802
Lucas?
Oh, yeah.

757
01:19:54,302 --> 01:19:57,806
Only one in the whole kiddie gang
knows his ass from a pitchfork.

758
01:19:57,807 --> 01:20:00,308
I'm kinda takin' him
under my wing.

759
01:20:01,810 --> 01:20:03,812
Yeah.

760
01:20:06,815 --> 01:20:09,818
How you doin'?
Nervous, i bet.

761
01:20:11,319 --> 01:20:14,823
I'm okay. Ever been
inside a jail before?

762
01:20:15,073 --> 01:20:17,074
No. No way.

763
01:20:17,075 --> 01:20:19,577
It's nasty, i'll tell ya. It
gives me the jimmies every time.

764
01:20:20,078 --> 01:20:22,580
Oh, yeah.

765
01:20:26,084 --> 01:20:29,586
Want some? What is it? Bourbon?

766
01:20:29,587 --> 01:20:32,590
It's just rye. You're
welcome to it, if you want.

767
01:20:32,591 --> 01:20:35,093
Oh, yeah. I heard that. It's good stuff.

768
01:20:35,593 --> 01:20:37,595
That'll really- It's
not a bad idea, really-

769
01:20:38,096 --> 01:20:42,100
Get a little juiced before you get
in there. Get some system goin'.

770
01:20:47,105 --> 01:20:49,607
See, the thing is, it's
gonna be worst of all on you.

771
01:20:49,608 --> 01:20:52,609
Why's that?

772
01:20:52,610 --> 01:20:56,364
Bein' a girl.
Bein'- Bein' a cute girl.

773
01:20:56,365 --> 01:21:00,117
Yeah, bein' real cute
and bein' a girl.

774
01:21:00,118 --> 01:21:05,123
All them other convicts and the perverts
and such, be givin' you a real long look.

775
01:21:05,124 --> 01:21:09,127
Oh, they be lookin' at
you all over. That's right.

776
01:21:10,628 --> 01:21:13,130
Convicts stare.

777
01:21:13,131 --> 01:21:15,133
Aren't you gonna protect me?
Can't.

778
01:21:15,134 --> 01:21:17,135
Sure.
Not from their eyes.

779
01:21:17,635 --> 01:21:19,137
Don't worry about it.

780
01:21:22,640 --> 01:21:25,643
Another sip of
that, you won't feel nothin'.

781
01:21:27,145 --> 01:21:29,147
Go on.

782
01:21:35,153 --> 01:21:38,156
Just go on.
That's good stuff, huh?

783
01:21:38,157 --> 01:21:40,658
Drink it.
Yeah.

784
01:21:56,674 --> 01:21:59,677
I am okay. Come on. Just leave it there.

785
01:22:01,679 --> 01:22:04,681
Whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

786
01:22:04,682 --> 01:22:08,686
Come on. Come on. What? You touched me.

787
01:22:08,687 --> 01:22:10,688
Okay.

788
01:22:13,191 --> 01:22:15,692
Come on.

789
01:22:15,693 --> 01:22:18,695
I wanna go-

790
01:22:18,696 --> 01:22:20,698
I wanna go see brad.
I don't wanna go in there.

791
01:22:20,699 --> 01:22:23,201
Screw brad.

792
01:22:23,202 --> 01:22:25,203
No.

793
01:22:30,208 --> 01:22:33,210
What are
you doing? Where's lucas?

794
01:22:33,211 --> 01:22:38,216
Made a mistake. To let a woman rule
his business- That is a mistake.

795
01:22:38,217 --> 01:22:40,468
What do you mean?

796
01:22:40,969 --> 01:22:43,971
Where the fuck-

797
01:22:43,972 --> 01:22:49,476
I wanna get out of this fucking
place. You scared yet? Hmm?

798
01:22:49,477 --> 01:22:51,980
Here, drink that down. You got
that pill? What is this place?

799
01:22:51,981 --> 01:22:54,983
Where is it? Where is it?
Let me see it. Right.

800
01:22:54,984 --> 01:22:57,485
Drink it down.
You scared yet?

801
01:22:57,486 --> 01:22:58,986
Mm.

802
01:22:58,987 --> 01:23:01,989
You oughta be.
I'm not scared of you.

803
01:23:01,990 --> 01:23:06,493
You scared yet? No? Look, we
gotta get something straight now.

804
01:23:06,494 --> 01:23:09,998
Oh, no, you're not goin' anywhere.
We gotta get somethin' straight.

805
01:23:09,999 --> 01:23:13,001
You ain't gonna see my son.

806
01:23:13,501 --> 01:23:17,004
Okay?
You give me your word.

807
01:23:17,005 --> 01:23:20,008
I gotta hear it.
I gotta believe it.

808
01:23:21,509 --> 01:23:24,011
I love brad.
Well, that's your mistake.

809
01:23:24,012 --> 01:23:28,015
I love him! That's a
mistake. It's over. That's it.

810
01:23:28,016 --> 01:23:31,769
You know too much, you think too
much, you talk too much. That's it.

811
01:23:31,770 --> 01:23:35,398
Okay? Where you goin'? Where you
goin'? Where the fuck you goin'?

812
01:23:35,399 --> 01:23:39,027
Come here. Let me tell you
something. Let me tell you something.

813
01:23:41,779 --> 01:23:44,665
- The answer's no.
- I ain't askin'.

814
01:23:50,671 --> 01:23:52,673
The answer is no.

815
01:23:55,176 --> 01:23:58,429
By the time i'm through with
you, you won't wanna see him.

816
01:23:58,430 --> 01:24:01,681
He won't wanna touch you. Do
you understand? Get off me!

817
01:24:01,682 --> 01:24:05,186
You understand? He won't wanna
fuckin' touch you. Get off me!

818
01:24:05,303 --> 01:24:07,305
You understand now?

819
01:25:14,839 --> 01:25:18,459
- Well?
- Sit down.

820
01:25:18,843 --> 01:25:23,848
Ma'am? Ma'am!

821
01:25:27,101 --> 01:25:30,605
Yes? Is there a thomas whitewood here?

822
01:25:32,974 --> 01:25:35,610
Are you thomas whitewood?

823
01:25:37,111 --> 01:25:40,114
What about it?
I need you to sign this.

824
01:25:45,620 --> 01:25:48,122
Please, just sign it.

825
01:25:51,125 --> 01:25:53,127
What is this?

826
01:25:56,631 --> 01:25:58,633
Uh-
Thank you.

827
01:26:06,641 --> 01:26:09,644
Somebody gave your name
to the grand jury.

828
01:26:09,645 --> 01:26:12,146
All right, you motherfucker!

829
01:26:25,026 --> 01:26:28,029
Motherfucker!

830
01:26:28,030 --> 01:26:31,032
Scum!
Motherfucker!

831
01:27:17,295 --> 01:27:20,298
Hell, man, don't
worry about no subpoena.

832
01:27:20,299 --> 01:27:22,799
They got nothing on you.

833
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:27,304
Yeah. Gee, i sure hope not.

834
01:27:27,305 --> 01:27:31,809
They're just fishin'
for somethin' or other.

835
01:27:31,810 --> 01:27:36,314
Now, where the
hell is this tractor, anyhow?

836
01:27:36,315 --> 01:27:38,316
Patch?
Up a ways.

837
01:27:38,683 --> 01:27:41,184
This is one hell of a...

838
01:27:41,185 --> 01:27:46,190
Jesus h. Christ kind of a place
to go find some tractor.

839
01:27:46,191 --> 01:27:49,694
We only found it,
'cause last year, dickie,

840
01:27:50,194 --> 01:27:52,196
He poached for deer
up in these woods.

841
01:27:52,697 --> 01:27:56,701
A white deer.
Right over in there.

842
01:28:03,624 --> 01:28:05,126
Now what's that?

843
01:28:09,880 --> 01:28:12,883
Damn, i thought he was gonna
back right into his grave.

844
01:28:42,413 --> 01:28:45,916
You know, aggie,
i like that ring you got.

845
01:28:45,917 --> 01:28:49,419
What'd it cost?
Beats me.

846
01:28:49,420 --> 01:28:54,425
Is that a real sapphire? Wouldn't you like to know?

847
01:28:56,927 --> 01:28:58,929
Yeah, i would.

848
01:29:03,434 --> 01:29:05,436
Is that a real gun?

849
01:29:33,547 --> 01:29:36,050
Come on, right over here!
Get your tickets right here!

850
01:29:36,051 --> 01:29:39,053
Get your tickets here!
Hubba, hubba, hubba!

851
01:29:43,057 --> 01:29:46,060
Come on, give me
one of those tickets!

852
01:30:05,663 --> 01:30:07,665
Ever been out west, tommy?

853
01:30:07,666 --> 01:30:10,200
No.

854
01:30:10,201 --> 01:30:15,205
Ever heard a coyote?
No.

855
01:30:15,206 --> 01:30:18,259
They make this sound like,
whoo, whoo, whoo.

856
01:30:20,311 --> 01:30:23,230
Coyote bitch gets in heat,

857
01:30:23,231 --> 01:30:25,732
First thing she does,

858
01:30:25,733 --> 01:30:28,219
She'd take care
of the males.

859
01:30:29,220 --> 01:30:32,739
Then she head toward town.

860
01:30:32,740 --> 01:30:35,726
All the neighborhood dogs,
they smell her.

861
01:30:35,727 --> 01:30:40,247
They go crazy.
They follow her.

862
01:30:42,950 --> 01:30:46,120
She lures them
out onto the desert.

863
01:30:46,121 --> 01:30:48,355
She get the dog
out there...

864
01:30:49,373 --> 01:30:51,875
alone.

865
01:30:51,876 --> 01:30:54,378
All the other coyote
come along.

866
01:30:54,379 --> 01:30:56,880
They circle round.

867
01:30:56,881 --> 01:30:59,934
They kill that dog.
Eat it.

868
01:31:02,603 --> 01:31:04,604
Tommy,

869
01:31:04,605 --> 01:31:10,110
If you was to go up in front of
that grand jury, what would you say?

870
01:31:10,111 --> 01:31:12,213
Nothin'.

871
01:31:14,782 --> 01:31:17,785
- Dad.
- Liar!

872
01:32:05,616 --> 01:32:09,620
That's our deal. You let me outta here
right now, or i don't say one more word.

873
01:32:09,753 --> 01:32:14,257
Can't do it. Your father's
hiding three kids already.

874
01:32:14,258 --> 01:32:17,761
Besides, the only thing you've talked
about so far are tractor thefts.

875
01:32:17,762 --> 01:32:19,763
Why should we think you have
anything else to tell us?

876
01:32:21,682 --> 01:32:23,934
Have you guys ever heard
of lester peralsky?

877
01:32:31,058 --> 01:32:34,562
Ma, terry and i are leaving'.
We're gettin' outta here.

878
01:32:34,563 --> 01:32:37,565
You'd be goin' where?

879
01:32:38,065 --> 01:32:40,067
I got relatives in-
Far away.

880
01:32:41,569 --> 01:32:43,954
Do you have any money
we can borrow?

881
01:32:45,456 --> 01:32:47,458
Not really.

882
01:32:47,958 --> 01:32:50,961
Well, i-I have a little bit.

883
01:32:50,962 --> 01:32:53,463
Great.

884
01:32:53,464 --> 01:32:58,969
Say, brad junior, have you
heard anything from tommy? No.

885
01:32:59,970 --> 01:33:02,973
I don't even wanna
think about tommy.

886
01:33:04,475 --> 01:33:06,476
What is that
supposed to mean?

887
01:33:06,477 --> 01:33:10,481
Just itself.
Don't think about him.

888
01:33:29,199 --> 01:33:32,069
How about this?

889
01:33:32,070 --> 01:33:34,705
Let's tie him to a tree...

890
01:33:34,706 --> 01:33:37,341
in the back of the woods...

891
01:33:37,808 --> 01:33:40,243
and just stare at him
for a while.

892
01:33:40,244 --> 01:33:44,381
No!
But can't you just see it?

893
01:33:44,382 --> 01:33:48,851
He's tied to a tree...
naked.

894
01:33:48,852 --> 01:33:52,856
And we could give him
like a lollipop or somethin'...

895
01:33:53,357 --> 01:33:56,844
or a can of budweiser.
Shut up!

896
01:33:59,313 --> 01:34:02,816
Suppose that
little girl is with him?

897
01:34:02,817 --> 01:34:05,319
Then bye-Bye girl.

898
01:34:06,286 --> 01:34:10,741
That's too bad.
She was real cute.

899
01:34:13,160 --> 01:34:17,665
Might be better, uh,
if it was at night.

900
01:34:20,167 --> 01:34:22,169
Right?

901
01:34:27,675 --> 01:34:30,177
I don't want no part of this. Boyd?

902
01:34:32,680 --> 01:34:35,683
You got the soul
of a pig,

903
01:34:37,151 --> 01:34:39,153
A stuck pig.

904
01:34:40,637 --> 01:34:43,640
Sooey.
Sooey, sooey.

905
01:34:47,611 --> 01:34:49,613
I don't care.

906
01:34:51,115 --> 01:34:54,118
I'm not touchin' this one.

907
01:34:54,119 --> 01:34:56,120
Okay.

908
01:35:06,264 --> 01:35:08,265
Well?

909
01:35:31,872 --> 01:35:34,992
You can hang it up where you're
going to. I mean, if you want to.

910
01:35:35,459 --> 01:35:37,411
Thanks.

911
01:35:49,173 --> 01:35:51,675
Gotta go. Brad!

912
01:35:54,678 --> 01:35:57,181
It's something
over 400.

913
01:35:57,182 --> 01:35:59,183
Thanks a lot.

914
01:35:59,683 --> 01:36:02,186
I guess
it's a rainy day.

915
01:36:02,187 --> 01:36:04,188
Thanks, grandma.

916
01:36:11,695 --> 01:36:13,697
Take care of terry now.
I will.

917
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:18,202
Good-Bye.
Bye.

918
01:37:15,092 --> 01:37:18,095
How's it coming?
It's almost there.

919
01:37:19,596 --> 01:37:22,599
It could wait till morning.

920
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:25,227
No. Your mother'll
be back in the morning.

921
01:37:25,228 --> 01:37:29,294
Farther we are away,
it'll be a lot better.

922
01:37:29,295 --> 01:37:33,360
J&j& you don't have to say
what i wanna do j&j&

923
01:37:33,361 --> 01:37:35,863

925
01:37:53,680 --> 01:37:57,683

at play memories of a pepsi day j&j&

926
01:37:57,684 --> 01:38:01,688
J&j& come on, come on and have a pepsi day

928
01:38:48,485 --> 01:38:51,488
Oh, i forgot

929
01:38:53,857 --> 01:38:54,858
Oh, no!

930
01:41:07,824 --> 01:41:10,327
Hey, dad.

931
01:41:16,983 --> 01:41:19,535
Let ya outta the stir?

932
01:41:19,536 --> 01:41:23,055

933
01:41:23,056 --> 01:41:26,009
and now i'm just runnin'
where they can't find me.

934
01:41:26,010 --> 01:41:28,995
That's good.

935
01:41:29,513 --> 01:41:31,515
Where nobody can find me.

936
01:41:31,516 --> 01:41:34,518
Good.

937
01:41:36,019 --> 01:41:38,021
You got a beer?

938
01:41:40,023 --> 01:41:42,526
Yeah, sure.

939
01:41:52,702 --> 01:41:54,704
