THE LADY KILLERS

2
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:14,725
The earth

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,475
Is in a blaze

4
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,105
The world

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,440
Is in a maze

6
00:00:26,695 --> 00:00:29,820
The way

7
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:33,160
Of life today

8
00:00:33,865 --> 00:00:37,080
Is strange and odd

9
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,375
What happened?

10
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:45,420
Across the sea

11
00:00:45,505 --> 00:00:48,715
May come

12
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,220
To you and me

13
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,805
Whoa, come

14
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:00,810
Let us go back

15
00:01:00,855 --> 00:01:02,645
To God

16
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,400
Go back

17
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,065
- To God
- Oh, come on

18
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,069
Let's go back to God

19
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:12,990
- Let us go back
- Let's go back to God

20
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:16,493
- Come on
- Let's go back to God

21
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:20,122
- Let us go back
- Let's go back to God

22
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:23,458
- I know the way
- Let's go back to God

23
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:27,337
- Without my Lord
- Let's go back to God

24
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:31,175
- It's mighty hard
- Let's go back to God

25
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:34,678
- Whoa, yeah
- Let's go back to God

26
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:38,307
- That I know the path
- Let's go back to God

27
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:42,394
- Wander path, yeah
- Let's go back to God

28
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:45,480
- Left his mark
- Let's go back to God

29
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:49,193
- Of hallowed troughs
- Let's go back to God

30
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:53,280
- Come on, yes
- Let's go back to God

31
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:56,450
- Let us go back
- Let's go back to God

32
00:01:56,533 --> 00:02:01,038
- Go back to God
- Come, let us go back

33
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,123
To God

34
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:33,946
Uh!

35
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:36,865
Oh,
Afternoon, Mrs, Munson,

36
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:38,784
Afternoon, Sheriff,

37
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:42,162
- You know the Funthes boy?
- Um,

38
00:02:42,246 --> 00:02:43,413
Mackatee Funthes?

39
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:45,958
Oh, no, not him,
Weemack,

40
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:49,002
- Mackatee's eldest,
- Oh, yeah,

41
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:52,214
- I don't believe I do,
- Well, he's a good boy and all,

42
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:56,301
but he done gone down to the Costco
in Pascagoula and got himself a blaster,

43
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:59,221
- What?
- And he been playing that music,

44
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:01,265
- Well, if you want, you know, I could,
- Loud!

45
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:04,726
- Well, I could go talk to him if you,
- "Left My Wallet in El Segundo,"

46
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:06,895
- He left his wallet?
- Hippity-hop music!

47
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:09,231
You know, they calls it hippity-hop music,

48
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:12,401
but it don't make me
want to go hippity-hop,

49
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:13,944
Hm,

50
00:03:13,986 --> 00:03:16,738
And Othar don't like that music neither,

51
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:23,495
- It's been disturbin' Othar then, has it?
- Well, how could it help but do?

52
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:26,373
"Left My Wallet in El Segundo"!

53
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:30,043
And, Sheriff, do you know what they call
colored folks in them songs?

54
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:32,754
Have you got any idea?

55
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:36,258
- No, ma'am, I don't think,
- Niggers!

56
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,386
I don't even want to say the word,
Now, I won't say it twice,

57
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:42,431
- I can tell you that, I say it one time,
- Yes, ma'am,

58
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,349
, in the course of swearin'
down my complaint,

59
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:45,726
- Yes'm,
- Niggers!

60
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:52,232
2000 years after Jesus!
30 years after Martin Luther King!

61
00:03:52,316 --> 00:03:54,401
The age of Montel!

62
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:55,944
Sweet lord of mercy,

63
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:58,405
Is that where we at?

64
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:01,325
Weemack down to Pascagoula
and gettin' himself

65
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:05,287
a big ol' thumpety stereo
so he can listen to that trash!

66
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:08,540
- Sheriff, you got to help that boy,
- You want me to help him?

67
00:04:08,624 --> 00:04:12,044
Extend that helpin' hand,
Show an interest,

68
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:14,880
- Well, we're here to help,
- Well, God bless you for that,

69
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:17,216
You don't want to be tried
and found wantin',

70
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:19,051
- No, ma'am,
- No, many, many done

71
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:24,264
tunkalow parzen, Sheriff,
Many, many done tunkalow parzen,

72
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:26,058
Many what, ma'am?

73
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:30,479
You been tried and found wantin'!
You don't want that writin' on the wall,

74
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,314
Oh, no, ma'am,
Don't want that on the wall,

75
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,942
- Feast of Balthazar,
- Yeah, that sounds good,

76
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:40,155
The apostle John said, "Behold,
there's a stranger in our midst,

77
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:43,325
- , come to destroy us,"
- Yes, ma'am,

78
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:49,998
Come, let us go back...

79
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,502
...to God
go back

80
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:58,423
- Oh, come on
- Let's go back to God

81
00:04:58,507 --> 00:05:02,135
- Let us go back
- Let's go back to God

82
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:06,223
- Come on
- Let's go back to God

83
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,393
- Let us go back
- Let's go back to God

84
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:13,188
- Come on, yes!
- Let's go back to God

85
00:05:13,272 --> 00:05:15,774
- Let us go back
- Let's go back

86
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:20,737
- To God
- Go back to God

87
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:24,074
Do you need somethin' to eat, angel?

88
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:30,122
Othar, I went and complained
about Weemack today,

89
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:33,125
Don't know if it'll do any good,

90
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:37,045
That boy hangin' by a thread,
Over the pit,

91
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:42,885
Fiery pit!
"Left My Wallet in El Segundo,"

92
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:45,846
Ooh!

93
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:50,475
67 years of life,

94
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:53,937
46 years of marriage,

95
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:58,275
You mean to tell me you never once
suffered from piles?

96
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,361
Well, it's the human condition,

97
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:03,697
Most humans, anyhow,

98
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:08,744
Like that ballplayer said,
"The world's got two kind of folks,"

99
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:13,373
"Them that's got the piles
and them that's goin' get 'em,"

100
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:16,251
But you always was healthy as a ox,

101
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:20,088
Passed on 'fore you could get the piles,

102
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:23,509
Ooh, thank the Lord you never was sick,

103
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:29,806
I just want to pass away
nice and peaceful,

104
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:34,436
Go to sleep one night, wake up
in the glory land! Whoo!

105
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:57,376
Pickles!

106
00:06:59,837 --> 00:07:03,799
- Go fetch Pickles!
- Pickles?

107
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:09,179
Oh, he's up that tree again!
You'd better shimmy on up,

108
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:11,974
Well, I do apologize, madam, but,

109
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:14,977
won't the feline eventually tire
of his lonely perch

110
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:17,938
and, pining for his master's affection,
return on his own initiative?

111
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:24,361
Uh, the point being,
must we actually ascend the tree?

112
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,114
Look, I don't want no doubletalk,

113
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:30,075
Now, if you not gon' fetch him,
I guess I gotta call the police,

114
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,828
- Police?
- And they not goin' be happy,

115
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:37,374
Every time they have to fetch him,
they swear they'll never do it no more,

116
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:41,003
No need to call the authorities, madam,

117
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:43,839
I did this often as a child,

118
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:47,384
I was a positive lemur,
Here, kitty!

119
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,888
- Oh, don't upset him now!
- I wouldn't think of it, madam,

120
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:55,851
Harmless little Felix domesticus,

121
00:07:55,893 --> 00:07:59,104
Here, Kitty,
Come to G, H,

122
00:07:59,188 --> 00:08:04,359
Come, come,
Here, kitty, Here, kitty,

123
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:06,069
Come, come, come,
No, no, no,

124
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:07,988
That's not how Sheriff Wyner do it,

125
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:09,865
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
Come, come, come,

126
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,827
Come to the professor,

127
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:17,623
Yes, Y,
Ah!

128
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:29,426
Uh, thank you, madam,
for your act of kindness,

129
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:32,095
- Well, you let him out,
- I certainly did,

130
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:34,848
and for that I apologize no end,

131
00:08:34,932 --> 00:08:39,311
Allow me to present myself,
um, formally,

132
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:42,814
Goldthwait Higginson Dorr, Ph, D,

133
00:08:44,316 --> 00:08:45,984
Like Elmer?

134
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:48,362
- I beg your pardon, ma'am?
- Fudd,

135
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:55,369
No, no, Ph, D, is a mark of
academic attainment

136
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:59,373
bestowed, in my case, in recognition of
my mastery of the antique languages

137
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:00,749
of Latin and Greek,

138
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:04,294
I also hold a number of other advanced
degrees, including the baccalaureate

139
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:07,214
from a school in Paris, France,
called the Sorbonne,

140
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:11,593
Sore bone,
Well, that fits,

141
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:14,513
You ever study at Bob Jones University?

142
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:16,098
I have not had that privilege,

143
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:19,852
Oh, that's a Bible school,
Only the finest in the country,

144
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:22,354
- I send 'em $5 every month,
- That is very generous,

145
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:25,440
- I'm on the mailin' list! I'm a Angel,
- Are you? Yes,

146
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:28,861
Oh, they list my name in
the newsletter every issue,

147
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:32,072
- Do they?
- Oh, I got the literature right over here,

148
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:34,908
- if you'd like to examine it,
- Perhaps when my head has

149
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:38,203
recovered from its, uh,
uh, buffeting,

150
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:41,290
Mrs, Munson, are you at all curious

151
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:46,128
as to why I darkened your door,
as the expression would have it,

152
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:49,798
on this lovely, lovely
camellia-scented morn?

153
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,676
Well, I was wonderin' till
you let Pickles out,

154
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,179
- I quite understand,
- Then in all the excitement,

155
00:09:55,262 --> 00:10:01,226
The fact is, I saw the sign in your window
advertising a room to let?

156
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:04,188
And there are no other such signs
among the houses

157
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:08,400
- on this charming, charming street,
- Yeah, I got a room,

158
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:12,487
$15 a week,
I'm lookin' for a quiet tenant,

159
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:17,242
Madam, you are addressing
a man who is quiet

160
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:23,916
and yet not quiet,
If I may offer a riddle,

161
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:29,254
I am currently on sabbatical from
the institution where I teach,

162
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:31,715
the University of Mississippi
at Hattiesburg,

163
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:35,344
I am takin' a year off to
indulge my passion,

164
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:37,304
and I do not believe that is
too strong a word,

165
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:40,182
for the music of the Renaissance,

166
00:10:40,224 --> 00:10:44,311
I perform in, and have the honor of
directing, a period-instrument ensemble

167
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:47,439
that performs at Renaissance Fairs
and other cultural for a

168
00:10:47,523 --> 00:10:49,691
throughout central and southern
Mississippi,

169
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:55,572
We perform on the instruments for which
the music was originally composed,

170
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:58,534
Now, wait a minute,
You got some kind of band?

171
00:10:58,742 --> 00:11:05,249
Oh, no, The word "band" would be,
in this context, something of a misnomer,

172
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:09,086
Though we do play together,
hence the word "ensemble",

173
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,922
the nature of the music is such that,

174
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:16,343
well, one would hesitate to apply
the epithet "band"

175
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:20,013
- with connotations of janglin' rhythms,
- So y'all ain't playin' no hippity-hop?

176
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:24,768
"I Left My Wallet in El Segundo",
Songs with the titles spelled all funny?

177
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:34,611
Oh, no, no, We play music that has been
composed to the greater glory of God,

178
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:40,242
Devotional music,
Church music,

179
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:41,743
Gospel music?

180
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:45,164
Well, inspired by the gospel, certainly,

181
00:11:45,247 --> 00:11:48,709
The vintage, of course,
is no more recent than the Rococo,

182
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:52,462
Rococo, huh?
Well, I guess that'd be OK,

183
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:57,092
But I don't propose to inflict
our rehearsals on you,

184
00:11:57,176 --> 00:12:02,347
May I inquire,
do you have a root cellar?

185
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:08,187
Ah, Yes,

186
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:13,150
Yes, yes,

187
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:16,278
This looks promising,

188
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,487
A little dank, ain't it?

189
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:21,116
Indeed,
That only improves the acoustics,

190
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,918
Marvelous,

191
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:35,422
Yes, Ah!

192
00:12:35,506 --> 00:12:39,426
Oh, these earthen walls
are ideal for baffling

193
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:45,015
the higher registers of the, uh,
lute or sackbut,

194
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:52,314
That is why so much music
of the cinquecento was played in crypts

195
00:12:52,356 --> 00:12:55,943
and catacombs, This is ideal,
This is perfect, This is more than perfect,

196
00:12:56,026 --> 00:13:01,490
- I can scarcely contain my glee,
- Oh, you containin' it OK,

197
00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:08,789
You gotta peel this shit out, man,
Sometimes it stick to the bottom,

198
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:12,251
Hey, this shit smells like piles,

199
00:13:12,334 --> 00:13:14,378
You wouldn't even believe this, man,
Even out here on the casino floor

200
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:17,381
you gonna find goddamn
mercy pads, Tucks,

201
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:20,175
I don't know what the fuck people be
doin' here while they gamblin',

202
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:24,388
Man, I ain't peelin' no funky shit
with my human hands,

203
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:26,974
That ain't nothin' but a prescription
for diseases and viruses

204
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:29,226
- and shit attackin' your fuckin' insides,
- Oh, well, shit, you gotta do it,

205
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:30,978
'cause Mr, Gudge checks everything,

206
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:34,398
This tunnel leads back onto the land
for all the people that work for Mannex,

207
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:37,734
Mannex Corporation, They own
the Bandit Queen, three other boats,

208
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:40,487
Now, this is where they think on their
corporate shit, Gudge and them,

209
00:13:40,696 --> 00:13:45,200
I mean, the light's as ugly as all hell,
but, shit, ain't as many Tucks,

210
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:49,413
- Let me in, motherfucker!
- What's the password?

211
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:51,498
Kiss my ass!

212
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:00,424
Now, this is where they count
the dough, Now, if you try to take any of it,

213
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:05,095
Elron over there'll shoot yo' ass,
Goddamn!

214
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:07,389
Dawg, this is a motherfuckin' pigsty, man!

215
00:14:07,431 --> 00:14:09,725
You are a squeakyass,
motherfuckin' pig!

216
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:13,061
Man, look at your ass,
You got Cocoa Krispies on your uniform,

217
00:14:13,145 --> 00:14:15,397
Got breakfast there, and you still eatin'
goddamn lunch, man,

218
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:19,401
I swear to God, if that ass was nickels,
you'd be a motherfuckin' millionaire,

219
00:14:19,443 --> 00:14:22,404
Spread out, boy, Look at you,
You a disgraceful fucka!

220
00:14:22,446 --> 00:14:25,240
You is a fat motherfucker, man!
I swear,

221
00:14:25,282 --> 00:14:27,409
Hey, Mr, Gudge, uh,

222
00:14:27,451 --> 00:14:28,827
- How you doin' this mornin'?
- I'm doin' fine,

223
00:14:28,911 --> 00:14:31,914
- All right,
- So, how's the new man?

224
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:34,041
Oh, shit, he a cleanin' motherfucker, man,

225
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:37,002
- Is that a fact?
- What's up, my nigga?

226
00:14:46,178 --> 00:14:49,765
Cut! Cut, cut, cut!

227
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:53,810
Goddamn it, his canteen fell off,
Props!

228
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:57,689
- The goddamn thing's canteen fell off,
- OK, We're prepared for that,

229
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:01,109
Mountain, put Otto into the apparatus,

230
00:15:06,657 --> 00:15:10,035
- What the hell is this?
- World War I vintage gas mask,

231
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:13,455
It's authentic, Strapped on,
of course, so it can't fall off,

232
00:15:13,497 --> 00:15:16,250
Now, the animal is free to be
as active as he wants,

233
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,836
It doesn't inhibit his movement
in any way, and,

234
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:21,296
, I think it really sells the whole
doughboy thing,

235
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:23,882
- It looks like a fucking joke,
- Uh, you're absolutely right,

236
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:26,385
The gas mask is a whimsical concept,

237
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:28,554
How the hell does it eat when it gets to
the Nibbles Ready-to-Eat?

238
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:31,306
- Well, you're absolutely right,
- Don't let the clients see this,

239
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,267
- Or that Humane fucker,
- No, of course not,

240
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,977
They'll just shut the fuckin' spot down,
Pancake, They'll shut,

241
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,019
, shut the fuckin' spot down, OK?

242
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:38,313
Put the goddamn canteen back on
the dog, That says he's a soldier!

243
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:41,483
Dented tin canteen,
All right? Strap it to his fucking collar!

244
00:15:41,692 --> 00:15:44,403
Easiest thing in the world,
I-I just thought,

245
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:45,737
What?

246
00:15:45,821 --> 00:15:49,366
, but you're right, A canteen's much better,
Good concept, Let's go with that,

247
00:15:53,287 --> 00:15:56,999
- What's he doing?
- Well, he's, uh,

248
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,293
- Just breathe normally, Otto,
- The fucking dog can't breathe,

249
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:02,129
Oh, no, he can breathe,
Eh, eh, that thing is,

250
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:05,132
- Just breathe normally, Otto,
- The fuckin' dog can't breathe,

251
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:06,675
The fuckin' dog cannot breathe!

252
00:16:06,717 --> 00:16:08,719
OK? Get the fu,
Get that fuckin' thing off of him,

253
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:11,346
Of course,
Easiest thing in the world,

254
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:13,265
I don't have my Leatherman, Mountain,
give me your Leatherman, Chop, chop!

255
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:15,350
Chitra! Make sure that Humane fucker
doesn't come over here, OK?

256
00:16:15,434 --> 00:16:17,102
Distract him,
He'll shit if he sees this,

257
00:16:17,186 --> 00:16:20,939
There we go,
Mountain, have electric run me a stinger,

258
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:24,151
Don't give up on me, Otto!
Mountain, I need two live leads!

259
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:25,861
Uh, eh, but, Garth, the gennie's
a hundred yards away,

260
00:16:25,903 --> 00:16:28,864
Goddamn it, Otto's gonna have irreversible
brain damage in about 30 seconds,

261
00:16:28,906 --> 00:16:31,533
Here we go, OK, kiss of life,

262
00:16:31,575 --> 00:16:34,369
Otto is fuckin' dead!
What the fuck are you doing?!

263
00:16:34,453 --> 00:16:36,413
Otto is fuckin' dead!

264
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:42,878
Set! 320! 320! Hut!

265
00:16:57,476 --> 00:17:01,813
L-left, 90-tiger, x-slant,
On one, Ready? Break!

266
00:17:01,897 --> 00:17:04,233
Hut!

267
00:17:12,991 --> 00:17:15,619
Split left, 6, Z-go,

268
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:18,956
- You the man, Hey, butthead!
- Huh?

269
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,375
- You the man!
- Me the man?

270
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,961
On one,
Ready? Break!

271
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:28,674
390! 390! Hut!

272
00:17:49,194 --> 00:17:52,197
Oh, no!

273
00:17:52,281 --> 00:17:56,660
Hudson! Get your ass off the field!
Get your ass off the field!

274
00:17:56,743 --> 00:18:00,289
Goddamn it! Hudson,
get your ass out of my game!

275
00:18:00,372 --> 00:18:02,624
You couldn't catch a cold!

276
00:18:22,603 --> 00:18:25,063
A'ight, Dragon Lady,
we want that fuckin' money,

277
00:18:25,147 --> 00:18:26,899
We want that doughnut money,

278
00:18:32,446 --> 00:18:34,323
- Oh! OK, papa-san,

279
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:35,657

00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:37,534
We ain't fuckin' around, Mr, Hi-Ho,

281
00:18:37,618 --> 00:18:39,411
Look, this fuckin' thing,
it ain't that complicated,

282
00:18:39,495 --> 00:18:41,955
You give us all the fuckin' money,
you won't get shot in the head,

283
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:44,416
A'ight?
You got three seconds,

284
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:50,672
You, You got three fucking seconds,

285
00:18:50,714 --> 00:18:53,634
- We want that doughnut money!
- I'm a count uno, and two and,

286
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:03,310
His fingers are way the fuck up my nose!

287
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:08,440
Get your fingers out my man's nose!

288
00:19:08,524 --> 00:19:11,151
Cafe?

289
00:19:11,235 --> 00:19:13,946
Ah!

290
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:18,116
Aah!

291
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:27,626
- Let it shine on
- All night

292
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:30,420
- Let it shine on
- Come on, now, let your

293
00:19:30,629 --> 00:19:32,923
- Light from the lighthouse
- Let it

294
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:34,424
Shine on me

295
00:19:34,633 --> 00:19:36,385
- Oh, let it
- Shine on

296
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:38,762
- Come on, let it
- Shine on

297
00:19:38,846 --> 00:19:41,890
- I need you to let your
- Light from the lighthouse

298
00:19:41,974 --> 00:19:43,851
Let it shine on me

299
00:19:43,934 --> 00:19:46,520
- Let it shine on me
- Shine on

300
00:19:46,687 --> 00:19:49,106
- Let it shine on me
- Shine on

301
00:19:49,273 --> 00:19:50,774
- Let it shine on me
- Shine on

302
00:19:50,858 --> 00:19:53,569
- You got to let it shine on me
- Shine on

303
00:19:53,652 --> 00:19:55,779
- When you're walkin' in darkness
- Shine on

304
00:19:55,863 --> 00:19:58,073
- You gotta let it shine
- Shine on

305
00:19:58,115 --> 00:20:02,452
If you want to see the light
You gotta let it shine

306
00:20:02,661 --> 00:20:04,413
You've got to let it shine

307
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:07,749
You've got to let it shine
Whoo!

308
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:12,087
Come on, shine, yes!
Come on, shine

309
00:20:12,171 --> 00:20:13,922
Come on, shine

310
00:20:14,006 --> 00:20:16,967
You've got to come on
and let it shine

311
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:23,223
Yeah, help me let it shine

312
00:20:23,307 --> 00:20:26,393
Let it shine

313
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:29,062
Shine!

314
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:32,107
Oh, yeah

315
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:34,526
- Hey, let it shine
- Shine on

316
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:36,737
- Let it shine
- Shine on

317
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,281
- Let it shine
- Shine on

318
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:42,159
Let the light from the lighthouse

319
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:44,286
Shine,

320
00:20:44,328 --> 00:20:45,996
On,

321
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,206
Me,!

322
00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:50,751
Let it shine on me
Yeah!

323
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:13,023
I know you all remember that when
Moses came down the mountain

324
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:17,903
carrying the Word of God,
come down that Sinai peak,

325
00:21:17,986 --> 00:21:20,656
- he caught them Israelites red-handed,
- Yes!

326
00:21:20,739 --> 00:21:22,950
What'd he catch 'em doin'?

327
00:21:23,033 --> 00:21:24,868
He caught 'em worshippin'

328
00:21:24,952 --> 00:21:26,829
- a golden calf,
- Yes!

329
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:28,831
He caught 'em worshippin'

330
00:21:28,872 --> 00:21:30,499
a false god,

331
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:34,920
He caught them Israelites in decline,

332
00:21:35,003 --> 00:21:36,296
In decline!

333
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:39,174
What did Moses do when he saw those,

334
00:21:39,216 --> 00:21:41,510
declinin', backslidin',
never-mindin' sinners?

335
00:21:41,552 --> 00:21:43,262
What did he do?

336
00:21:43,345 --> 00:21:47,432
Mosses smote those sinners
in his wrath! Yes, he did!

337
00:21:47,516 --> 00:21:50,227
Y'all know what "smote" is?

338
00:21:50,894 --> 00:21:53,272
I smite, you smite, he smites,
we done smote!

339
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:59,444
To smite is to go upside the head!

340
00:21:59,528 --> 00:22:02,781
Because sometimes, brothers and sisters,
that's the only way!

341
00:22:02,865 --> 00:22:04,825
The only way,

342
00:22:04,908 --> 00:22:09,538
To smite is to remind
we got to stop that decline

343
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:13,458
and scramble back up to the face
of the Almighty God!

344
00:22:13,709 --> 00:22:16,211
- Amen!
- Instead of worshippin'

345
00:22:16,295 --> 00:22:20,924
that golden calf, that earthly trash
on that garbage island,

346
00:22:21,008 --> 00:22:25,470
That garbage island in the shadowland,
wa-a-ay,

347
00:22:29,266 --> 00:22:31,018
way outside the Kingdom of God!

348
00:22:31,101 --> 00:22:34,354
That garbage island,
where scavenger birds feast

349
00:22:34,438 --> 00:22:39,902
on the bones of the backslidin' damned!

350
00:22:39,985 --> 00:22:43,864
And so,
let us pray,

351
00:22:54,374 --> 00:22:59,087
My dear lady, I do so hope this is not
an inopportune time for our first practice,

352
00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:00,297
Somebody die?

353
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:03,133
I beg your pardon? Oh!

354
00:23:03,217 --> 00:23:06,720
No, no, no,
No, I'm not bereaved,

355
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:11,225
Though it is so kind of you to inquire,
The hearse is simply a vehicle

356
00:23:11,308 --> 00:23:14,561
commodious enough to accommodate
all the members of our ensemble,

357
00:23:14,645 --> 00:23:20,275
And, of course, our instruments contrived
in an age ignorant of miniaturization,

358
00:23:20,317 --> 00:23:23,111
Allow me to introduce my friends,
my colleagues,

359
00:23:23,153 --> 00:23:25,030
these devoted and passionate musicians,

360
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:27,282
Ain't no smokin' in this house,

361
00:23:27,324 --> 00:23:29,701
Oh,
Sorry,

362
00:23:49,221 --> 00:23:53,141
What do you think, General?
Present any problems?

363
00:23:57,437 --> 00:24:03,652
Good then, Gentlemen, why don't we
crowd around and go over the plan?

364
00:24:07,531 --> 00:24:13,537
Gentlemen, this is the Bandit Queen,
Gambling den, Cash cow,

365
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:17,916
Sodom of the Mississippi Delta
and the focus of our little exercise,

366
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,835
Here is Orchard Street,

367
00:24:19,918 --> 00:24:21,795
Here is the residence of Marva Munson,

368
00:24:21,879 --> 00:24:24,464
the charming lady whom you all met
moments ago,

369
00:24:24,715 --> 00:24:26,341
Gentlemen, I'm sure you're all aware

370
00:24:26,383 --> 00:24:29,845
that the Solons of the state of
Mississippi, to wit, its legislature,

371
00:24:29,928 --> 00:24:32,389
have decreed that no gaming
establishment shall be erected

372
00:24:32,472 --> 00:24:34,808
within its borders upon dry land,

373
00:24:34,892 --> 00:24:38,020
They may, however, legally float,

374
00:24:38,061 --> 00:24:42,274
While the gambling activity is restricted
to these riverboats, no such restrictions

375
00:24:42,357 --> 00:24:45,319
apply to the functions ancillary
to this cash-besotted business,

376
00:24:45,402 --> 00:24:47,988
The casino's offices, locker rooms,

377
00:24:48,071 --> 00:24:51,200
facilities to cook and clean, and,
most importantly, its counting houses,

378
00:24:51,283 --> 00:24:57,080
the reinforced, secret,
super-secure repositories of the lucre,

379
00:24:57,164 --> 00:25:01,293
may all be situated, wherever,

380
00:25:01,376 --> 00:25:06,340
- Gawain, where is "wherever"?
- Say what?

381
00:25:07,758 --> 00:25:10,135
- Where's the money?
- Oh,

382
00:25:10,219 --> 00:25:12,930
OK, look,
At the end of every shift,

383
00:25:13,013 --> 00:25:17,226
pit boss brings the cash down to
the hold of the ship in a locked cashbox,

384
00:25:17,267 --> 00:25:21,313
and once a day all the cash is moved
down to the countin' room,

385
00:25:23,106 --> 00:25:25,400
And where is the counting room?

386
00:25:25,442 --> 00:25:30,239
Uh, it be right there in that square
where you pointin',

387
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:33,992
And what,
to flog a horse that if not dead

388
00:25:34,076 --> 00:25:39,498
is at this point in mortal danger of expiring,
does this little square represent?

389
00:25:40,499 --> 00:25:43,001
Offices, Underground,

390
00:25:43,085 --> 00:25:47,422
Ha!
Underground!

391
00:25:47,464 --> 00:25:50,259
Underground,

392
00:25:50,342 --> 00:25:52,469
During the casino's hours of operation,

393
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:55,222
the door to this counting room
is fiercely guarded,

394
00:25:55,305 --> 00:25:57,850
The door itself is of redoubtable
Pittsburgh steel,

395
00:25:57,933 --> 00:26:01,395
When the casino closes this entire
underground complex is locked up,

396
00:26:01,645 --> 00:26:05,858
and the armed guard
retreats to the casino's main entrance,

397
00:26:05,941 --> 00:26:10,904
There, then, far from the guard,
reposes the money,

398
00:26:10,988 --> 00:26:17,619
behind a five-inch-thick steel portal, yes,
But the walls,

399
00:26:17,661 --> 00:26:21,540
the walls are but humble masonry

400
00:26:21,623 --> 00:26:26,837
behind which is only the soft,
loamy soil deposited over centuries

401
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:30,382
by the Old Man,
the meanderin' Mississippi,

402
00:26:30,465 --> 00:26:37,014
as it fanned its way back and forth across
the great alluvial plain, leaving earth,

403
00:26:38,682 --> 00:26:42,019
This earth,

404
00:26:42,102 --> 00:26:46,106
The General here, whose
curriculum vitae comprehends

405
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:49,902
massive tunnelin' experience through
the soil of his native French Indochina,

406
00:26:49,985 --> 00:26:53,655
shall be directin'
our little old tunnelin' operation,

407
00:26:53,739 --> 00:26:58,160
Garth Pancake, though a master of none,
is a jack of all those trades

408
00:26:58,202 --> 00:26:59,995
corollary to our aim,

409
00:27:00,078 --> 00:27:02,331
He will be doin' such fabricatin'
and demolition work

410
00:27:02,414 --> 00:27:06,043
- as our little caper shall require,
- Happy to be on board,

411
00:27:06,126 --> 00:27:09,630
Gawain is our proverbial "inside man,"

412
00:27:09,713 --> 00:27:14,426
He has managed to secure himself a berth
on the custodial staff of the Bandit Queen,

413
00:27:14,676 --> 00:27:18,639
- Damn skippy!
- And this brings us to Lump,

414
00:27:19,515 --> 00:27:23,435
To look at Lump, you might wonder
what specialized expertise

415
00:27:23,644 --> 00:27:27,689
could he possibly offer
our merry little old band of miscreants,

416
00:27:27,731 --> 00:27:31,109
Well, gentlemen,
in a project of such risks,

417
00:27:31,193 --> 00:27:36,657
it is imperative to enlist the services of a
hooligan, a goon, an ape, a physical brute,

418
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:42,955
Someone who will be our security,
our battering ram, our blunt instrument,

419
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:46,250
And, on our behalf,
I wish him a warm Mississippi welcome,

420
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:48,168
- Fuckin' A,
- Whassup, my nigga?

421
00:27:48,252 --> 00:27:51,380
Well, gentlemen, here you are,

422
00:27:51,463 --> 00:27:54,299
Men of different backgrounds
and differing talents,

423
00:27:54,383 --> 00:27:56,218
Men with, in fact,
but two things in common:

424
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:59,721
One, you all saw fit to answer my
advertisement in the Memphis Scimitar,

425
00:27:59,763 --> 00:28:01,765
and two, you're all going to be,
in consequence,

426
00:28:01,849 --> 00:28:04,852
very, very, incredibly, rich,

427
00:28:04,935 --> 00:28:07,896
Let us revel in our adventure, gentlemen,

428
00:28:07,938 --> 00:28:11,316
Let us make beautiful music together,

429
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,486
and, by all means,
let us keep this to ourselves,

430
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:19,783
What we say in this root cellar,
let it stay in this root cellar,

431
00:28:19,867 --> 00:28:23,495
There's no "l" in "team",

432
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:17,674
Trouble in and trouble out

433
00:29:17,758 --> 00:29:19,885
Trouble's wwhat this wworld's about

434
00:29:19,968 --> 00:29:23,347
Troubles of this world
the Devil's in this world

435
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:25,432
Trouble in, trouble out

436
00:29:25,516 --> 00:29:27,768
Trouble's wwhat this wworld's about

437
00:29:27,851 --> 00:29:31,021
Troubles of this world
the Devil's in this world

438
00:29:31,104 --> 00:29:35,150
You up the river without a paddle
in a lot of trouble

439
00:29:35,234 --> 00:29:39,196
Without a doubt you going under
running out of bubbles

440
00:29:39,238 --> 00:29:42,866
Pass me the body bag
watch me dump 'em

441
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:46,745
It ain't nothing for you
to get squashed like a pumpkin

442
00:29:46,829 --> 00:29:50,457
I try so hard and play my cards
afraid to fall, I ain't involved

443
00:29:50,541 --> 00:29:52,251
I gotta call
I'm much appalled

444
00:29:52,334 --> 00:29:54,253
I came to O Z
and broke the laws

445
00:29:54,336 --> 00:29:56,004
Bring on the casket
ain't too glad

446
00:29:56,088 --> 00:29:58,340
'Cause dirty hazard
wrapped in plastic

447
00:30:42,718 --> 00:30:46,096
It's OK, Don't stop on account of me,

448
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:48,390
No, No, no, no, no,
Not at all, madam,

449
00:30:48,473 --> 00:30:50,726
Not at all, We were about to
take a break anyway,

450
00:30:50,767 --> 00:30:55,022
The glissandi on this particular piece
are technically very, very demanding,

451
00:30:55,105 --> 00:30:58,817
and I'm sure we would all welcome
a moment of R and R,

452
00:30:58,901 --> 00:31:01,737
Well, I just thought
maybe you'd like to see,

453
00:31:01,778 --> 00:31:05,157
What have you gotten into, honey?
Why you sweating like that?

454
00:31:06,116 --> 00:31:08,535
Uh, Uh,

455
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,164
Uh, eh, 'cause, 'cause,
That boy right there?

456
00:31:12,247 --> 00:31:15,417
He plays one bitch barrel
full of a sackbut!

457
00:31:15,459 --> 00:31:17,002
- Ain't that right, Lump?
- Uh-huh,

458
00:31:17,085 --> 00:31:19,129
I'm tellin' you, he can tear it up,
Right, Lump?

459
00:31:19,213 --> 00:31:22,466
Ain't nobody play the sackbut
like Lump right there, He,

460
00:31:22,716 --> 00:31:23,383
Hoo-hoo-hoo!

461
00:31:23,467 --> 00:31:26,178
Don't be shy, Lump,
Don't be shy, Lump, that boy, he go,

462
00:31:26,261 --> 00:31:28,722
at it like it was some pussy!

463
00:31:28,805 --> 00:31:30,516
- Oh, shit!
- Mind your mouth!

464
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:35,354
This is a Christian house, boy,
No hippity-hop language in here,

465
00:31:35,437 --> 00:31:39,024
- Sometime it's the only way,
- Now listen, you ain't gonna hit me,

466
00:31:39,107 --> 00:31:43,570
I'm tryin' to help you, boy, better yourself!

467
00:31:43,654 --> 00:31:46,073
And so you should, madam,
So you should,

468
00:31:46,156 --> 00:31:49,743
Gawain is so far transported

469
00:31:49,827 --> 00:31:53,163
by his love of the music of
the early Renaissance,

470
00:31:53,247 --> 00:31:56,250
Don't make me no never-mind,
he transported!

471
00:31:56,333 --> 00:31:57,793
- I understand,
- You been smokin'?

472
00:31:57,876 --> 00:32:01,129
Oh, certainly not, ma'am,
I understand your indignation, ma'am,

473
00:32:01,171 --> 00:32:03,465
And I was offering an explanation,
not an excuse,

474
00:32:03,674 --> 00:32:04,466
- I myself am,
- Hey, hey, hey,

475
00:32:04,508 --> 00:32:06,468
, don't be explainin' me, dawg!

476
00:32:06,677 --> 00:32:09,012
You can't read
my motherfuckin' mind, man!

477
00:32:09,096 --> 00:32:12,808
You might got yo' Ph, D,
but I got my GED!

478
00:32:12,891 --> 00:32:15,310
- Yes,
- Nigga!

479
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:21,942
A fiery lad, but then youth is fiery,

480
00:32:22,025 --> 00:32:26,572
A fact often remarked upon
by the poets of the Romantic era,

481
00:32:26,655 --> 00:32:29,491
My youth, I was in church,
I wasn't walkin' around fiery,

482
00:32:29,533 --> 00:32:32,578
Youth ain't no excuse for nothin',

483
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:40,294
Anyhow, I just came to show you the fife,
Othar's fife, Burned his own,

484
00:32:40,377 --> 00:32:44,089
I thought maybe, you bein'
a man of music, you'd be interested,

485
00:32:44,173 --> 00:32:46,925
Oh, indeed I am,

486
00:32:47,009 --> 00:32:49,636
Cut it himself and burned his holes,

487
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:52,806
The Israelites called it a khalil,

488
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:57,603
Yeah, you can read all about it in
the Bible, Ain't nothin' new under the sun,

489
00:32:57,686 --> 00:32:59,354
Indeed not,

490
00:33:03,901 --> 00:33:07,779
Gone these 20 years,

491
00:33:07,863 --> 00:33:10,574
He was some kind of man,

492
00:33:15,078 --> 00:33:18,499
Blowed the khalil,

493
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:28,383
I don't suppose Othar ever turned his hand

494
00:33:28,467 --> 00:33:34,640
or, or turned his lip
to blowing the shofar?

495
00:33:37,476 --> 00:33:43,482
The ceremonial ram's horn
sounded by the priests of the Hebrews,

496
00:33:43,565 --> 00:33:49,029
No, I don't know nothin' about that,
Othar never blowed no shofar!

497
00:33:49,112 --> 00:33:52,074
- Of course not,
- Not to the extent of my knowledge,

498
00:33:52,115 --> 00:33:55,786
The khalil was good enough
for my Othar,

499
00:33:57,454 --> 00:33:59,832
He was some kind of man,

500
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:05,212
Some kind of man,

501
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:10,551
Oh, goddamn! Come on, girl,
let me get one little peek,

502
00:34:10,634 --> 00:34:12,427
Don't be cruel,
Come on, just one butt cheek,

503
00:34:12,678 --> 00:34:14,680
Pull that ass out and make it clap,

504
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:19,101
Aw, just 'cause I'm dressed like a janitor,
don't mean you gotta do me dirty,

505
00:34:19,142 --> 00:34:22,145
This muthafucka's hit the jackpot,
Come on, girl,

506
00:34:22,187 --> 00:34:23,772
Come over here and blow on these dice,

507
00:34:23,856 --> 00:34:26,108
You know, I'm a seven on the roll now,
but I'm a 10 the hard way,

508
00:34:26,191 --> 00:34:27,651
and I ain't just talkin' crap,

509
00:34:30,904 --> 00:34:34,783
Mr, Gudge, she had a ass
that could pull a bus,

510
00:34:34,825 --> 00:34:38,287
I mean, Gudge, it was more than an ass,
it was literature,

511
00:34:38,328 --> 00:34:42,374
Yeah, I don't care how big her ass was,
MacSam, You're fired,

512
00:34:42,457 --> 00:34:43,417
You say what?

513
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,753
There is no fraternizing with customers
on the Bandit Queen,

514
00:34:46,837 --> 00:34:48,881
- Clean out your locker,
- But, Mr, Gudge, I wasn't fraterniz,

515
00:34:48,964 --> 00:34:50,424
I said get outta here,
You're fired,

516
00:34:50,507 --> 00:34:54,094
You can't fire me!
I'll sue your ass!

517
00:34:54,178 --> 00:34:56,054
Sue me?
For what?

518
00:34:56,138 --> 00:34:58,307
For fuckin' punitive damages, man!

519
00:34:58,348 --> 00:34:59,474
- Punitive damages,
- Yeah,

520
00:34:59,683 --> 00:35:01,685
Punitive damages,
You goddamn skippy!

521
00:35:01,768 --> 00:35:05,272
- Punitive damages,
- I see why you firin' me, Mr, Gudge,

522
00:35:05,355 --> 00:35:09,151
Yeah, it's simple and plain,
You firin' me 'cause I'm black,

523
00:35:11,737 --> 00:35:15,657
MacSam, everybody
on the custodial staff is black,

524
00:35:15,741 --> 00:35:17,743
Your replacement is gonna be black,

525
00:35:17,826 --> 00:35:20,204
His replacement, no doubt, will be black!

526
00:35:21,413 --> 00:35:24,166
Well, the fuckin' judge is goin' be black,
muthafucka,

527
00:35:24,249 --> 00:35:25,250
- Oh,
- And you?

528
00:35:25,334 --> 00:35:27,669
- You gon' stand tall before the man,
- Oh,

529
00:35:27,711 --> 00:35:29,213
And your replacement's gonna be black,

530
00:35:29,296 --> 00:35:31,465
- muthafucka!
- Thank you,

531
00:35:33,467 --> 00:35:35,677
Oh, my,

532
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:37,471
Oh, my, my, my,
my, my, my, my,

533
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:39,014
This is a severe setback,

534
00:35:39,056 --> 00:35:41,683
I am distraught,
I'm more than distraught,

535
00:35:41,725 --> 00:35:43,685
I am devastated,

536
00:35:43,727 --> 00:35:47,397
I-I'm beside myself,
I'm at a positive loss for words,

537
00:35:47,481 --> 00:35:51,193
- You still talkin' OK, though,
- Have you all decided?

538
00:35:51,235 --> 00:35:56,490
Madam, we must have waffles,
We must all have waffles forthwith,

539
00:35:56,573 --> 00:35:58,784
We must all think,
We must all have waffles

540
00:35:58,867 --> 00:36:02,204
and think, each and every one of us,
to the very best of his ability,

541
00:36:02,287 --> 00:36:05,833
Perhaps if you apologized to the man
and gave him flowers,

542
00:36:05,916 --> 00:36:08,085
Or perhaps a fruit basket

543
00:36:08,168 --> 00:36:11,964
with a card depicting a misty seascape
and inscribed with a sentiment,

544
00:36:12,047 --> 00:36:15,384
I ain't apologizin' to that muthafucka,
He fired me 'cause I'm black!

545
00:36:15,425 --> 00:36:18,679
He can't do that, You could sue him,
Open and shut case,

546
00:36:18,762 --> 00:36:20,722
- Fuckin' A,
- Surely a chocolate assortment

547
00:36:20,764 --> 00:36:24,518
has been known to melt the heart
of even the hardest misanthrope,

548
00:36:24,601 --> 00:36:26,895
That man ain't rollin' over
for no fucking candy bar,

549
00:36:26,937 --> 00:36:29,731
Uh, we've had a bit of a setback
on the tunneling front, too,

550
00:36:29,773 --> 00:36:33,902
- We've run into a pretty large rock,
- Rock!

551
00:36:35,696 --> 00:36:40,450
- Very bad, Very bad,
- Oh, my,

552
00:36:42,077 --> 00:36:45,914
Seems that the poet was right,

553
00:36:45,998 --> 00:36:49,001
Troubles never singly come,

554
00:36:49,084 --> 00:36:51,003
Oh, no, we can get through the rock,
No worries there,

555
00:36:51,086 --> 00:36:53,463
Easiest thing in the world,
Why, we just blow right through it,

556
00:36:53,714 --> 00:36:56,967
I got a pyro license,
Just, uh, bore a hole in the rock

557
00:36:57,050 --> 00:37:01,013
and pack in a little plastique,
Igneous blows pretty good,

558
00:37:01,096 --> 00:37:02,389
- And then we could,
- Hello, Garth,

559
00:37:02,472 --> 00:37:04,892
- Am I ordering the primer cord?
- Yes, Mountain,

560
00:37:04,975 --> 00:37:08,729
We were just talking about that,
and some plastique,

561
00:37:08,812 --> 00:37:11,648
- What the fuck is this?
- Oh, this is Mountain Girl,

562
00:37:11,732 --> 00:37:14,860
Mountain is my right hand,
She helps me out with ordnance,

563
00:37:14,943 --> 00:37:17,905
- Helps me with, damn near everything,
- Hey,

564
00:37:18,822 --> 00:37:21,909
You brought yo' bitch to the Waffle Hut?

565
00:37:21,992 --> 00:37:26,538
I must confess myself
to be puzzled as well,

566
00:37:26,622 --> 00:37:30,417
I thought it was understood that
when it came to our little enterprise,

567
00:37:30,501 --> 00:37:32,794
"mum" was the word,

568
00:37:32,878 --> 00:37:35,255
Of course, I understand that,
but this is Mountain Girl,

569
00:37:35,339 --> 00:37:37,508
I don't keep secrets from Mountain,

570
00:37:37,591 --> 00:37:40,469
That's not how you maintain a loving,
caring relationship,

571
00:37:41,178 --> 00:37:44,306
You brought yo' bitch to the Waffle Hut!

572
00:37:44,348 --> 00:37:49,269
The man brought his bitch,
to the Waffle Hut!

573
00:37:49,353 --> 00:37:52,773
All right, look, you, I will thank you
to stop referring to Mountain that way,

574
00:37:52,856 --> 00:37:54,525
She is the other half of my life,

575
00:37:54,608 --> 00:37:59,655
Everybody lookin' at me like I'm some kind
of fuck-up for losin' a sorry-ass job,

576
00:37:59,738 --> 00:38:03,408
and this muthafucka brings his bitch

577
00:38:03,659 --> 00:38:06,161
- to the muthafuckin' Waffle Hut!
- Son-of-a-bitch punk!

578
00:38:06,245 --> 00:38:08,831
- Shut your goddamn mouth!
- You better raise the fuck up, fucka!

579
00:38:08,872 --> 00:38:10,374
- Gentlemen, please,
- Back the fuck up!

580
00:38:10,415 --> 00:38:11,875
You gon' back that shit the fuck up!

581
00:38:11,959 --> 00:38:14,670
- Gentlemen, please,
- What?! What?!

582
00:38:14,753 --> 00:38:19,049
Please, gentlemen, this behavior does you
no credit in the eyes of your colleagues,

583
00:38:19,132 --> 00:38:23,220
nor in those of the other patrons
of this Waffle Hut,

584
00:38:23,303 --> 00:38:25,222
Little punk,

585
00:38:25,305 --> 00:38:28,016
Oh, look at this,
I got blueberry syrup on my safari jacket!

586
00:38:28,058 --> 00:38:32,646
Gentlemen, I propose that we consider
the matter of this woman,

587
00:38:32,729 --> 00:38:35,315
- Mountain Water,
- Mountain Girl,

588
00:38:35,399 --> 00:38:40,154
I'm so very sorry, I propose
that we consider this matter closed,

589
00:38:40,237 --> 00:38:44,950
And we shall choose to trust her
since we have no choice,

590
00:38:45,033 --> 00:38:48,537
and since she shall share only
in Mr, Pancake 's portion of the booty,

591
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:51,165
Of course,
Wouldn't have it any other way,

592
00:38:51,248 --> 00:38:53,458
- Yeah, you damn right you won't,
- Up yours, punk,

593
00:38:53,667 --> 00:38:56,378
- Oh, fuck you and the Swiss Miss,
- The matter of disposing

594
00:38:56,461 --> 00:38:59,590
- of our igneous impediment is also,
- C-Coach, Coach,

595
00:38:59,673 --> 00:39:02,926
- C-C-Coach, I,
- , closed, Settled,

596
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:08,015
That leaves us only with the question
of Gawain retrieving his job,

597
00:39:08,098 --> 00:39:10,350
- Coach, I,
- Yes, Lump?

598
00:39:10,434 --> 00:39:12,394
Couldn't we just bribe the guy?

599
00:39:29,453 --> 00:39:34,166
You are a readin' fool,
aren't you, Mr, Dorr?

600
00:39:35,959 --> 00:39:38,754
Yes, I must confess,

601
00:39:38,795 --> 00:39:41,381
I often find myself more at home
in these ancient volumes

602
00:39:41,465 --> 00:39:46,261
than I do in the hustle-bustle
of the modern world,

603
00:39:46,345 --> 00:39:52,100
To me, paradoxically, the literature
of the so-called "dead tongues"

604
00:39:52,142 --> 00:39:56,396
holds more currency
than this morning's newspaper,

605
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,609
In these books, in these volumes,

606
00:40:00,692 --> 00:40:05,280
there is the accumulated wisdom
of mankind, which succors me

607
00:40:05,364 --> 00:40:10,452
when the day is hard
and the night lonely and long,

608
00:40:12,496 --> 00:40:16,291
The wisdom of mankind, huh?

609
00:40:16,333 --> 00:40:19,294
- What about the wisdom of the Lord?
- Oh,

610
00:40:19,336 --> 00:40:25,926
Yes, yes, The Good Book, mm,
I have found reward in its pages,

611
00:40:26,009 --> 00:40:32,015
But, to me, there are other
good books as well,

612
00:40:33,517 --> 00:40:41,483
Heavy volumes of antiquity freighted
with the insights of man's glorious age,

613
00:40:41,692 --> 00:40:50,409
And then, of course, I just love, love, love
the works of Mr, Edgar Allan Poe,

614
00:40:50,492 --> 00:40:53,453
Oh, I know who he was,
Kinda spooky,

615
00:40:53,537 --> 00:40:56,123
No, madam, no, no,

616
00:40:56,206 --> 00:40:59,501
Not of this world, it's true,

617
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:05,465
He, he lived in a dream,
An ancient dream,

618
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,597
"Helen,

619
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:16,393
Thy beauty is to me

620
00:41:16,476 --> 00:41:21,398
Like those Nicean barks of yore,

621
00:41:21,481 --> 00:41:26,695
That gently, o'er a perfumed sea,

622
00:41:26,737 --> 00:41:30,407
The weary, wayward wanderer bore

623
00:41:30,491 --> 00:41:34,703
To his own native shore,"

624
00:41:40,501 --> 00:41:42,794
Who was Helen?

625
00:41:42,878 --> 00:41:48,217
- Some kinda whore of Babylon?
- One doesn't know who Helen was,

626
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:53,514
but I picture her as being very, very,

627
00:41:53,722 --> 00:41:57,601
extremely,

628
00:41:57,684 --> 00:41:59,311
pale,

629
00:42:05,442 --> 00:42:09,363
Mrs, Munson, I have been trying

630
00:42:09,446 --> 00:42:14,243
to figure out some way of
expressin' my gratitude to you

631
00:42:14,326 --> 00:42:20,457
for takin' in this weary, wayward wanderer,

632
00:42:21,416 --> 00:42:25,379
It's just a little old present,
Why, it's hardly anything at all,

633
00:42:25,462 --> 00:42:30,008
Oh, why, Mr, Dorr!
You are a gallant man,

634
00:42:30,092 --> 00:42:32,052
Oh, madam, I blush, I melt,
No,

635
00:42:32,135 --> 00:42:34,429
I just happened to hear
of this gospel concert tomorrow night,

636
00:42:34,471 --> 00:42:36,598
"The Mighty, Mighty Clouds of Joy",

637
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,601
and I thought you and a friend
from church perhaps would,?

638
00:42:39,643 --> 00:42:43,188
- Yes, I have a widow lady friend,
- The concert is up in Memphis,

639
00:42:43,272 --> 00:42:46,900
so I have arranged a car service
to transport you thither,

640
00:42:48,735 --> 00:42:50,028
Ah?

641
00:42:50,112 --> 00:42:53,282
Why, Sheriff Wyner!
How you doin'?

642
00:42:53,365 --> 00:42:54,408
Good evenin', Mrs, Munson,

643
00:42:54,491 --> 00:42:58,120
I just stopped by here to let you know
I did have a talk with Weemack,

644
00:42:58,162 --> 00:43:00,914
and he told me he's gonna comply
with your request

645
00:43:00,998 --> 00:43:02,291
in keepin' that music down
and neighborly,

646
00:43:02,374 --> 00:43:04,376
So you just go and have yourself
a pleasant evenin',

647
00:43:04,459 --> 00:43:06,420
Wait a minute,
I got somebody that I want you to meet,

648
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:09,590
Uh, ma'am, you know what? I'm,
I'm a little pressed for time,

649
00:43:09,673 --> 00:43:11,633
You got a gang of bank robbers
youse chasin'?

650
00:43:11,717 --> 00:43:13,760
Come on in here and say hello,

651
00:43:13,844 --> 00:43:16,471
Yeah, we was in here, havin' tea and,

652
00:43:21,685 --> 00:43:23,937
Huh!

653
00:43:24,021 --> 00:43:27,524
Bussed his own dishes,
You can always tell a gentleman,

654
00:43:27,608 --> 00:43:30,986
- Somebody was in here, ma'am?
- Yeah, with me and Othar,

655
00:43:31,069 --> 00:43:33,363
Well, you know what?
Maybe I'll catch him the next time,

656
00:43:33,447 --> 00:43:35,949
Oh, come on up to his room
with me and say hello,

657
00:43:36,033 --> 00:43:37,910
I got a family,
My wife got dinner on the table,

658
00:43:37,993 --> 00:43:39,912
I really have to be goin',

659
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:48,504
- Oh, my, He is neat!
- Yes, ma'am, he very neat,

660
00:43:48,712 --> 00:43:54,051
He probably went down to the cellar
to play with his friends,

661
00:43:54,134 --> 00:43:56,678
Ma'am, I really got to be goin' now,

662
00:43:56,762 --> 00:44:00,098
- What,?
- Ma'am, I really need to be gettin' back,

663
00:44:02,059 --> 00:44:05,020
Mrs, Munson, don't,
You don't have to,

664
00:44:05,062 --> 00:44:06,063
Mrs, Munson?

665
00:44:06,104 --> 00:44:09,650
Why, Professor!

666
00:44:09,733 --> 00:44:14,279
What in the world are you doin'
havin' tea down there?

667
00:44:14,363 --> 00:44:15,739
Uh, Mrs, Munson?

668
00:44:15,823 --> 00:44:17,491
Oh, Lord Jesus,

669
00:44:25,666 --> 00:44:28,919
- Mrs, Munson?
- Land of Goshen, child!

670
00:44:29,002 --> 00:44:33,131
- Come on out from under there!
- Mrs, Munson, my pager just went off,

671
00:44:33,215 --> 00:44:38,053
I got to go,
I'll meet you and your friend later,

672
00:44:41,765 --> 00:44:44,268
That was refreshing,

673
00:44:44,351 --> 00:44:45,394
Y'all have a good evenin' now!

674
00:44:45,477 --> 00:44:48,772
As you know, we academics are
inordinately fond of wedgin' ourselves

675
00:44:48,856 --> 00:44:50,941
into confined spaces,

676
00:44:51,024 --> 00:44:55,404
At Yale, the students will see how many
of their number they can enclose

677
00:44:55,487 --> 00:44:57,823
in a telephone booth,
At Harvard, a broom closet,

678
00:44:57,906 --> 00:45:00,367
Oh! Hope I didn't spill my tea,

679
00:45:01,869 --> 00:45:04,705
Well, what the hell is this?

680
00:45:06,081 --> 00:45:08,417
I guess it's just my way of sayin', um,

681
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:14,673
Oh, well, goddamn it, Mr, Gudge,
Look here, I,

682
00:45:14,756 --> 00:45:16,717
I don't know what it's like
walkin' in your shoes,

683
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,844
You know, with you bein'
a tight-ass and all,

684
00:45:18,927 --> 00:45:23,098
And I'm pretty sure you don't know
what it's like walkin' in my shoes,

685
00:45:23,182 --> 00:45:26,226
See, Mr, Gudge,
there's the custodian, right?

686
00:45:26,310 --> 00:45:29,396
And then there's the man
inside the custodian,

687
00:45:29,479 --> 00:45:32,274
And that's the motherfucker
we got a problem with,

688
00:45:32,316 --> 00:45:34,735
See, 'cause that man,
he got needs, Mr, Gudge,

689
00:45:34,818 --> 00:45:38,197
and normally those needs
gotta do with women with big asses,

690
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:42,451
I guess my point bein' is
I realize I'm a bunkie junkie,

691
00:45:42,493 --> 00:45:46,914
But if you woulda seen the kettle drums
on this girl, Mr, Gudge, whew!

692
00:45:46,997 --> 00:45:50,876
Well, we all human,

693
00:45:50,959 --> 00:45:55,547
This apology buys you
a one-week probationary period,

694
00:45:56,256 --> 00:45:57,674
Thank you, Mr, Gudge,

695
00:45:57,758 --> 00:45:59,968
Stay away from the customers,
MacSam,

696
00:46:10,896 --> 00:46:13,732
This drill bit's getting awfully hot,

697
00:46:13,816 --> 00:46:19,905
Gawain, maybe you could fill a Hudson
sprayer and spritz it down while I drill,

698
00:46:19,988 --> 00:46:24,952
Fuck you, I ain't your motherfuckin'
house nigger, I'm the inside man,

699
00:46:25,035 --> 00:46:26,954
All right, look, are you gonna have
a bug up your ass

700
00:46:27,037 --> 00:46:28,497
for the rest of the time we
work together?

701
00:46:28,539 --> 00:46:31,458
- I'll get the sprayer,
- Oh, no, no, No,

702
00:46:31,542 --> 00:46:34,378
Me and this gentleman here
have to get square,

703
00:46:34,461 --> 00:46:37,214
Let me tell you somethin', MacSam,

704
00:46:37,297 --> 00:46:39,675
I'm gonna tell you about
how I came down to Mississippi,

705
00:46:39,716 --> 00:46:45,389
I wasn't born here, you know,
I'm from Scranton, Pennsylvania,

706
00:46:45,472 --> 00:46:46,473
What the fuck?

707
00:46:48,851 --> 00:46:53,480
Scranton, Pennsylvania,
Came down here in 1964, Greyhound bus,

708
00:46:53,564 --> 00:46:55,315
With the Freedom Riders,

709
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:59,194
Do you know who
the Freedom Riders were, MacSam?

710
00:46:59,236 --> 00:47:00,821
No, and I don't give a fuck,

711
00:47:00,904 --> 00:47:03,198
Just tell me when the fuck
they gonna leave, Damn!

712
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,200
The Freedom Riders,
my fine young man,

713
00:47:05,242 --> 00:47:07,786
were a group of concerned liberals
from up north,

714
00:47:07,870 --> 00:47:11,331
all working together,
just like we are here,

715
00:47:11,415 --> 00:47:13,792
Involved citizens who came down here

716
00:47:13,876 --> 00:47:17,421
so that local black folk
could have their civil liberties,

717
00:47:17,504 --> 00:47:20,465
So that people like you
could have the vote,

718
00:47:26,096 --> 00:47:29,558
- You know what, man?
- What, brother?

719
00:47:29,641 --> 00:47:33,270
- I don't vote, So fuck you,
- You little fuckin' ingrate,

720
00:47:33,353 --> 00:47:35,856
- And the bus you rode in on, jackass!
- Let's step outside, MacSam!

721
00:47:35,939 --> 00:47:37,524
Fuck the outside!
Come on! What?!

722
00:47:37,608 --> 00:47:39,443
(knocking)

723
00:47:42,279 --> 00:47:45,824
My friend Mrs, Funthes is here,
so I'm about to go out,

724
00:47:45,908 --> 00:47:49,036
Just thought I'd leave y'all
with some cinnamon cookies,

725
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:51,914
Why, that is lovely,

726
00:47:51,997 --> 00:47:54,541
Ooh, y'all sound good!

727
00:47:54,625 --> 00:47:58,378
(chuckles) Maybe you could come by
the church one Sunday,

728
00:47:58,462 --> 00:48:01,340
- give us a recital,
- Why, how kind of you!

729
00:48:01,423 --> 00:48:05,260
Our music, however, is, uh,
well, how shall I put this?

730
00:48:05,344 --> 00:48:08,013
Uh, a bit Roman in its outlook,

731
00:48:08,096 --> 00:48:11,350
Uh, many of our pieces were
commissioned by the Holy See,

732
00:48:11,433 --> 00:48:13,685
Oh, I see, all right,

733
00:48:13,769 --> 00:48:17,356
but we don't make no big
whoop-dee-do about denomination,

734
00:48:18,065 --> 00:48:22,277
Everybody welcome at our church,
Yeah, we had a Methodist come in,

735
00:48:22,361 --> 00:48:28,242
Episcopalian, Back in the '60s,
we had a Jew come in!

736
00:48:28,325 --> 00:48:31,745
- He had a guitar,
- (chucking) A Jew with a guitar,

737
00:48:31,829 --> 00:48:36,124
If you will excuse me one moment, madam,
I shall, uh, I shall see you out,

738
00:48:36,166 --> 00:48:39,795
If you gentlemen can labor harmoniously
in the course of my absence,

739
00:48:39,878 --> 00:48:41,922
perhaps upon my return
we shall be prepared to explode

740
00:48:42,005 --> 00:48:44,216
that vexin' old piece of igneous,

741
00:48:45,843 --> 00:48:49,972
Oh, Professor!
This is Mrs, Funthes,

742
00:48:50,013 --> 00:48:52,724
Enchant, Mrs, Funthes, Allow me,

743
00:48:52,808 --> 00:48:56,770
Rosalie, this is Professor
G, H, Dorr, Ph, D,

744
00:48:57,688 --> 00:49:00,399
Oh, my, That's an awful lot of letters,

745
00:49:00,482 --> 00:49:01,942
Oh, well, no,

746
00:49:02,025 --> 00:49:06,947
Of course, in my youth,
I was known simply as Goldthwait,

747
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:07,865
Uh-huh,

748
00:49:07,948 --> 00:49:09,783
All right, safety meeting,

749
00:49:09,867 --> 00:49:12,870
Let's listen up, General,
can you hand me the primer cord?

750
00:49:12,953 --> 00:49:16,248
Before we set the charge,
we will run through our procedure,

751
00:49:16,331 --> 00:49:20,419
I have earplugs for whoever wants them,
Just wedge those right in your ears,

752
00:49:20,627 --> 00:49:23,046
Now, here we have,
Not yet, Lump,

753
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:25,424
- Oh,
- Now, primer cord,

754
00:49:25,674 --> 00:49:28,927
Gelatinite, C-4,

755
00:49:29,011 --> 00:49:32,681
Time comes, we pack the hole
in the rock with the C-4

756
00:49:32,764 --> 00:49:36,810
and insert two leads: A and B,

757
00:49:36,935 --> 00:49:39,646
I remember my father sayin' to me -

758
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:41,940
and it's one of the few memories
I retain of the man

759
00:49:42,024 --> 00:49:45,694
from one of his visits home,
and how I do cherish it -

760
00:49:45,777 --> 00:49:53,202
he said to me, "Goldthwait,
you are not formed as other boys,"

761
00:49:53,285 --> 00:49:54,661
He a man of learnin'?

762
00:49:54,745 --> 00:49:58,207
This is the same procedure we will
be using when we collapse the tunnel

763
00:49:58,290 --> 00:50:02,252
after entering the casino vault
and returning to the root cellar,

764
00:50:02,336 --> 00:50:06,215
He was a self-educated man,
Didn't have a career as such,

765
00:50:06,298 --> 00:50:09,384
but the government did recognize
the breadth of his readin'

766
00:50:09,468 --> 00:50:14,056
by makin' him librarian
of the state nervous hospital in Meridian,

767
00:50:14,097 --> 00:50:17,976
where he was a distinguished inmate,

768
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:23,690
Once these materials are combined
only the professionals may handle them,

769
00:50:23,774 --> 00:50:27,402
That means me or the General,

770
00:50:27,486 --> 00:50:30,364
Separately they are harmless,
completely inert,

771
00:50:30,447 --> 00:50:34,034
Why, you could light this stuff on fire,
hit it with a ham,

772
00:50:34,117 --> 00:50:36,245
(explosion)

773
00:50:39,289 --> 00:50:44,086
What in the name of
heavens was that?

774
00:50:44,127 --> 00:50:48,423
Well, um, I'm quite certain there's
absolutely no reason to be alarmed,

775
00:50:48,507 --> 00:50:52,511
Why, I'm not even absolutely certain
I heard anything at all,

776
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:54,346
Didn't hear nothin'?!

777
00:50:54,429 --> 00:50:56,932
Well, something perhaps,

778
00:50:57,015 --> 00:51:01,061
Nothing that need discompose us
was the sense I was tryin' to convey,

779
00:51:01,144 --> 00:51:05,065
Now, Mrs, Munson, I will not have you
missin' your musical recital, Off you go!

780
00:51:05,149 --> 00:51:08,402
I shall call the gas company,
or the water company,

781
00:51:08,485 --> 00:51:13,407
Whatever subterranean utility
is implicated in this contretemps,

782
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:19,079
I shall see to the matter,
as only a highly educated classicist could,

783
00:51:27,087 --> 00:51:32,009
Blood! Blood, Professor, blood!
Blood, blood, blood!

784
00:51:32,092 --> 00:51:34,761
(Pancake) It's nothin' to make a fuss about,
It's perfectly all right,

785
00:51:34,845 --> 00:51:37,472
Jackass! You better get yo' ass back
down there and find that shit, dipshit!

786
00:51:37,556 --> 00:51:40,142
- Really, I'm perfectly all right,
- Perfectly all right?

787
00:51:40,225 --> 00:51:42,978
Jackass, you just blew
your goddamn finger off!

788
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:45,606
The muthafucka down there
flappin' the fuck around!

789
00:51:45,689 --> 00:51:47,483
You better get yo' ass
back down there and find it!

790
00:51:47,733 --> 00:51:50,235
I'm tellin' you right now, nubbie,
I ain't pickin' up your goddamn finger!

791
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:52,279
I gather there was a premature detonation,

792
00:51:52,362 --> 00:51:54,698
Would you tell this muthafucka
he can sew this shit back on?!

793
00:51:54,781 --> 00:51:57,284
It's like that dude whose wife cut
his dick off, threw it on the freeway?

794
00:51:57,367 --> 00:51:58,952
She just called Triple A,

795
00:51:59,036 --> 00:52:01,288
they towed the dick
and sewed the muthafucka back on!

796
00:52:01,371 --> 00:52:04,082
Listen up! Jackass,
I saw the muthafucka in a porno!

797
00:52:04,166 --> 00:52:06,460
The thang still worked!
It looked like a chewed-up frank,

798
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:07,961
but that little muthafucka
be workin' that muthafucka!

799
00:52:08,045 --> 00:52:12,257
It's mangly, but he be fuckin' the bitch
all kind of ways with a twisted dick!

800
00:52:12,341 --> 00:52:15,385
Oh! Your fuckin' finger just moved!
The muthafucka movin' slow now!

801
00:52:15,469 --> 00:52:19,264
I'm not gettin' that shit,
Fuck that! You're on your own there!

802
00:52:19,348 --> 00:52:23,810
They usin' the house
to practice music, of the Rococo,

803
00:52:27,064 --> 00:52:30,150
I propose we get our fallen comrade
to the hospital,

804
00:52:30,234 --> 00:52:34,029
The General will follow when
he manages to recover the severed digit,

805
00:52:34,071 --> 00:52:38,408
No, no, really, I'm perfectly all right,
I don't know what all the fuss is about,

806
00:52:39,243 --> 00:52:43,413
- Good news! Good news!
- Pickles! Go get him!

807
00:52:43,497 --> 00:52:45,707
The house is in apple-pie order,

808
00:52:45,749 --> 00:52:48,877
though we do have to get
medical attention for Mr, Pancake,

809
00:52:48,961 --> 00:52:52,881
who, durin' the disturbance, pinched
his finger in the valve of his sackbut,

810
00:52:52,965 --> 00:52:54,424
You let the cat out!

811
00:52:54,508 --> 00:52:59,513
Wha,? The General is even now
exercisin' every effort in retrievin'

812
00:52:59,596 --> 00:53:01,932
your mischievous little Pickles,
Please, go on,

813
00:53:02,015 --> 00:53:06,395
Go on and enjoy the concert!
Driver! Au revoir, mesdames,

814
00:53:18,782 --> 00:53:22,327
(Dorr) Despite our setback,
we find ourselves on schedule

815
00:53:22,411 --> 00:53:27,332
to penetrate the vault here this afternoon,
while Mrs, Munson is at church,

816
00:53:27,416 --> 00:53:31,378
havin' blasted that little old rock to pieces
durin' Mrs, Munson's choir practice,

817
00:53:31,461 --> 00:53:35,507
Garth, can you run us through the
game plan for what remains of our tunnel?

818
00:53:35,591 --> 00:53:39,678
Of course, Why, it's child's play now,
Easiest thing in the world,

819
00:53:39,761 --> 00:53:43,432
Only a couple of feet
separate us from the vault,

820
00:53:43,473 --> 00:53:46,977
Just the usual spadework
until we get to the masonry of the vault,

821
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:48,395
and then we just drill through,

822
00:53:48,479 --> 00:53:53,150
And will you be able to wield the drill
with your maimed extremity?

823
00:53:53,233 --> 00:53:57,070
Oh, well, yeah, I should think so,
Yeah, it's, uh, it's only one finger,

824
00:53:57,154 --> 00:54:02,367
Inhibits me in doing finer work of course,
I'll always have to live with that,

825
00:54:02,451 --> 00:54:04,369
(clears throat)

826
00:54:04,453 --> 00:54:06,914
Maybe - I'm just thinkin' out loud here -

827
00:54:06,997 --> 00:54:11,043
maybe, since as you say
there will be problems later,

828
00:54:11,126 --> 00:54:14,963
maybe - and I actually mentioned this
to Mountain Girl, she agrees with me,

829
00:54:15,047 --> 00:54:19,968
so it's not just one person's opinion -
maybe, uh,

830
00:54:20,052 --> 00:54:25,390
I should get a little extra compensation
for the accident,

831
00:54:29,269 --> 00:54:32,481
Somewhat larger share,

832
00:54:33,857 --> 00:54:36,777
Why, if this was any other line of work,
I'd be getting workman's comp,

833
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:39,404
Wouldn't I?
Might even have a pretty good lawsuit,

834
00:54:39,488 --> 00:54:43,283
Wait, so you gonna sue yourself
for blowing your own goddamn finger off?

835
00:54:43,367 --> 00:54:46,078
- Well, now that is simply asinine,
- Yes, but you see, Garth,

836
00:54:46,161 --> 00:54:50,082
this is not what you just called
"some other line of work,"

837
00:54:50,165 --> 00:54:51,416
Yeah, no, no, no, but if it were,

838
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:53,669
This is a criminal enterprise,
not to put too fine a point on it,

839
00:54:53,752 --> 00:54:56,964
entailing any manner of risk
not involved in honest labor,

840
00:54:57,047 --> 00:54:58,674
Governmental regulations
and civic safeguards

841
00:54:58,757 --> 00:55:02,719
cannot be assumed to apply
to antisocial pursuits,

842
00:55:02,803 --> 00:55:06,682
- Yeah, but he lost his finger,
- We don't give a fuck!

843
00:55:06,765 --> 00:55:10,018
That fool could blow his goddamn dick off,
it don't make no nevermind to us!

844
00:55:10,102 --> 00:55:13,063
We not payin' this jackass for goin' around
blowin' off goddamn body parts!

845
00:55:13,147 --> 00:55:14,982
Get yo' fuckin' head out yo' ass, man!

846
00:55:15,065 --> 00:55:16,650
Look you, there is no call for,

847
00:55:16,733 --> 00:55:18,443
No extra share!

848
00:55:22,322 --> 00:55:25,367
OK, Majority rules,

849
00:55:25,450 --> 00:55:29,121
Like I say, it was just a trial balloon,
Hand's not so bad really,

850
00:55:29,204 --> 00:55:30,164
I even get some phantom feeling,

851
00:55:30,205 --> 00:55:32,374
Yeah, you pull on your prick,
you get some phantom feelin',

852
00:55:32,457 --> 00:55:33,417
- Fuck you,
- Fuck you,

853
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:35,836
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you, nubbie!

854
00:55:35,919 --> 00:55:37,796
Well, now that that matter is settled,

855
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:41,258
why don't we synchronize our watches
before Gawain reports to work,

856
00:55:41,341 --> 00:55:45,220
In 20 seconds, it will be exactly 12:16,

857
00:55:45,304 --> 00:55:48,182
- Fifteen,
- What, it'll be 12:15?

858
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:52,478
No, 15 seconds, Well, 11 seconds now,
itll be 12:16,

859
00:55:52,686 --> 00:55:56,398
- Eight, seven,
- Professor? Prof,?

860
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:57,733
- , six,
- Professor?

861
00:55:57,816 --> 00:56:00,027
, five,
Yes, Lump!

862
00:56:00,110 --> 00:56:02,404
I don't have a watch,

863
00:56:04,406 --> 00:56:09,786
There'll be no more
weepin' and wailin'

864
00:56:09,870 --> 00:56:13,749
No more weepin' and wailin'

865
00:56:13,957 --> 00:56:17,836
No more weepin' and wailin'

866
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:21,632
Home to live with God
Oh,

867
00:56:21,715 --> 00:56:26,136
Soon I will be done
with the troubles of this world

868
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:29,097
Troubles of this world
Troubles of this world

869
00:56:29,181 --> 00:56:33,310
Oh, soon I will be done
with the troubles of this world

870
00:56:33,393 --> 00:56:37,439
I'm goin' home to live with God

871
00:56:37,523 --> 00:56:41,443
Soon I will be done
with the troubles of this world

872
00:56:41,652 --> 00:56:43,403
Troubles of this world
Troubles of this world

873
00:56:43,487 --> 00:56:45,739
Troubles of this world

874
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:49,409
Soon I will be done
with the troubles of this world

875
00:56:49,493 --> 00:56:53,413
I'm goin' home to live with God

876
00:56:53,497 --> 00:56:57,835
Well, soon I will be done
with the troubles of this world

877
00:56:57,918 --> 00:57:02,130
Troubles of this world
Troubles of this, great God!

878
00:57:02,214 --> 00:57:05,050
Soon I will be done
with the troubles of this world

879
00:57:05,133 --> 00:57:09,471
I'm goin' home to live with God

880
00:57:09,555 --> 00:57:14,309
Well, I'm goin' up to see King Jesus
Hey, hey, yeah!

881
00:57:14,393 --> 00:57:16,854
I'm gonna shake His loving hand

882
00:57:16,937 --> 00:57:21,358
I'm gonna tell Him all about my trouble

883
00:57:21,441 --> 00:57:26,029
As I'm travelin' through this land!

884
00:57:26,113 --> 00:57:29,324
Oh, soon I will be done

885
00:57:29,408 --> 00:57:32,035
Troubles of this world

886
00:57:33,871 --> 00:57:37,708
Yeah, soon I will be done

887
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:41,336
I'm goin' home to live with God

888
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:47,384
Yeah, soon I will be done
with the troubles of this world

889
00:57:47,467 --> 00:57:49,261
Troubles of this world

890
00:57:49,344 --> 00:57:53,265
Yeah, soon I will be done
with the troubles, yeah

891
00:57:53,348 --> 00:57:59,146
I'm goin' home to live with God

892
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,277
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

893
00:58:06,695 --> 00:58:09,198
Ain't that somethin'!

894
00:58:14,203 --> 00:58:16,163
(moans)

895
00:58:19,875 --> 00:58:22,211
- I, B, S,
- You be what?

896
00:58:23,378 --> 00:58:26,840
Irritable Bowel Syndrome!
Is there a men's room down here?

897
00:58:26,924 --> 00:58:29,092
Oh, come on, You shouldn't be usin'
the men's room now!

898
00:58:29,176 --> 00:58:31,303
Or a lady's room, (sniffs) Quickly,
I, B, S,

899
00:58:31,386 --> 00:58:33,305
If you knew you had the runs,
why didn't you shit back at the house?

900
00:58:33,388 --> 00:58:34,348
Quickly!

901
00:58:34,431 --> 00:58:36,767
We don't want Elron finding
your stinkin' ass on the crapper!

902
00:58:36,850 --> 00:58:39,937
No choice,
It's a medical condition, Quickly!

903
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:43,023
You one disgustin' individual,
you know that?

904
00:58:43,106 --> 00:58:45,734
Come on,
Follow me,

905
00:58:46,777 --> 00:58:48,445
(toilet flushes)

906
00:58:53,784 --> 00:58:55,244
I feel 30 pounds lighter,

907
00:58:55,285 --> 00:58:59,248
- Come the fuck on with your stinkass,
- Thank you for being so understanding,

908
00:58:59,331 --> 00:59:02,584
Not everyone is, of course, which is why
the biggest challenge of I, B, S,

909
00:59:02,668 --> 00:59:05,295
is educating the public,

910
00:59:05,379 --> 00:59:09,883
Afflicts over two million people,
yet most of us have never heard of it,

911
00:59:09,967 --> 00:59:13,178
And it strikes without regard to age,
gender or race,

912
00:59:13,262 --> 00:59:15,305
Oh, fuck, man,
I don't wanna hear about this shit,

913
00:59:15,389 --> 00:59:18,183
Well, that's exactly the kind
of attitude we're fighting,

914
00:59:18,267 --> 00:59:21,603
I guess I never told you that's how
Mountain Girl and I met,

915
00:59:21,645 --> 00:59:25,149
They had an I, B, S, weekend
at Grossinger's up in the Catskills,

916
00:59:25,232 --> 00:59:27,276
Of course, the tourist business
there has suffered

917
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:29,611
with the demise of the Borscht Belt,

918
00:59:29,653 --> 00:59:33,365
so they have various promotions,
mixers, so on,

919
00:59:33,448 --> 00:59:38,745
This was a weekend for Irritable Bowel
singles to meet and support each other

920
00:59:38,829 --> 00:59:40,372
- and share stories,
- Man, look here,

921
00:59:40,455 --> 00:59:42,124
I don't want to hear
a single one of them stories, OK?

922
00:59:42,166 --> 00:59:45,085
- Now, some of them are very moving,
- Not one fucking story!

923
00:59:45,169 --> 00:59:50,174
- Look, I didn't choose to have I, B, S,
- Man, shut the fuck up!

924
00:59:50,257 --> 00:59:54,344
There's no cure, you know,
Only control, Lifelong condition,

925
00:59:54,428 --> 00:59:57,139
Yeah, you know what?
Bein' an asshole's a lifelong condition, too,

926
00:59:57,222 --> 00:59:59,183
Just drop the fuckin' tools,

927
00:59:59,266 --> 01:00:01,768
I'm not complaining,
I did meet Mountain Girl,

928
01:00:01,852 --> 01:00:03,353
Man, get back in the fuckin' hole!

929
01:00:04,730 --> 01:00:09,776
Oh! (laughs) Marvel, Marvelous, Marv,
This way! This way, gentlemen!

930
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:14,990
Oh! Excellent! Excellent,
Flawless, flawless, Thumbs up,

931
01:00:19,578 --> 01:00:23,624
Can't stop shittin',
Can't stop talkin' about shittin',

932
01:00:28,295 --> 01:00:32,591
Gentlemen, to we few, We who have
shared each other's company,

933
01:00:32,674 --> 01:00:35,344
each other's cares, each other's joys,

934
01:00:35,427 --> 01:00:37,971
and who shall now reap the fruits
of our communal efforts,

935
01:00:38,055 --> 01:00:40,766
shoulder to shoulder,
from each according to his abilities,

936
01:00:40,849 --> 01:00:42,142
so forth and whatnot,

937
01:00:42,226 --> 01:00:44,978
We have had our little differences
along the way,

938
01:00:45,062 --> 01:00:49,358
but I'd like to think that they've only
made us value one another all the more,

939
01:00:49,399 --> 01:00:51,485
Each of us coming to understand
and appreciate

940
01:00:51,568 --> 01:00:56,990
the other's unique qualities
and potencies and, yes, foibles,

941
01:00:58,116 --> 01:01:03,247
I suggest that we shall
look back upon this little caper one day,

942
01:01:03,330 --> 01:01:10,170
one distant day,
grandchildren dandled upon our knee,

943
01:01:10,254 --> 01:01:15,175
and perhaps a tear will form
and we shall say,

944
01:01:15,259 --> 01:01:20,305
"Well, with wit and grit
and no small amount of courage,

945
01:01:20,389 --> 01:01:24,726
we accomplished something on that day,

946
01:01:24,768 --> 01:01:30,399
a feat of derring-do,
an enterprise not ignoble,"

947
01:01:30,482 --> 01:01:35,737
We merry band, unbound
by the constraints of society

948
01:01:35,779 --> 01:01:39,491
and the prejudices of the common ruck,

949
01:01:39,575 --> 01:01:43,620
We happy few,

950
01:01:43,704 --> 01:01:47,332
- Gentlemen, to us!
- (all) To us!

951
01:01:49,126 --> 01:01:50,711
(laughter)

952
01:01:55,507 --> 01:01:57,509
Charge shoulda gone off already,

953
01:01:57,718 --> 01:01:59,428
I do beg your pardon?

954
01:01:59,511 --> 01:02:03,390
The charge to collapse the tunnel,
I set it for eight minutes,

955
01:02:03,473 --> 01:02:08,020
Well, that much time and more
has certainly elapsed,

956
01:02:10,772 --> 01:02:14,318
I need not remind you,
it is of the essence of this plan

957
01:02:14,401 --> 01:02:17,070
that the money should appear to have
simply vanished without a trace,

958
01:02:17,154 --> 01:02:19,948
- spirited away, as it were, by ghosts,
- Of course,

959
01:02:20,032 --> 01:02:22,784
The conundrum of the undisturbed,
yet empty vault,

960
01:02:22,868 --> 01:02:25,704
the unsolvable riddle
of the sealed yet violated sanctum,

961
01:02:25,787 --> 01:02:26,997
is of the utmost importance,

962
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:30,417
not only to make our caper
more intellectually satisfying,

963
01:02:30,501 --> 01:02:33,128
it is exigent as a matter of practical fact,

964
01:02:33,212 --> 01:02:38,884
I remind you that if any tunnel
is ever found leading to this house,

965
01:02:39,927 --> 01:02:44,681
the owner knows all your names,

966
01:03:12,251 --> 01:03:14,670
(stomach rumbling)

967
01:03:31,186 --> 01:03:33,480
(alarm)

968
01:03:41,029 --> 01:03:44,241
("Trouble of This World")

969
01:04:01,008 --> 01:04:02,426
(rumbling)

970
01:04:21,862 --> 01:04:24,698
You just fart?

971
01:04:24,740 --> 01:04:27,284
(laughing)

972
01:04:36,668 --> 01:04:41,757
Nope, nope, I'm fine,
Perfectly all right! Not a problem!

973
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:44,259
There's no hole left,

974
01:04:44,301 --> 01:04:46,720
Professor!

975
01:04:47,763 --> 01:04:49,556
I'm surprised!

976
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:58,440
Well, uh, properly speaking, madam,
we are surprised, You are taken aback,

977
01:04:58,482 --> 01:05:00,734
Though I do acknowledge
that the sense that you intend

978
01:05:00,776 --> 01:05:05,489
is gaining increasing currency
through its use, yes,

979
01:05:05,572 --> 01:05:08,867
You have returned from
your devotions betimes,

980
01:05:08,951 --> 01:05:10,410
I had to make tea,

981
01:05:10,494 --> 01:05:14,998
I want to talk to you, Professor,
so don't you be leavin'!

982
01:05:15,082 --> 01:05:21,088
And you! I told you I don't want
any smokin' in this house!

983
01:05:21,171 --> 01:05:23,632
(doorbell rings)

984
01:05:26,927 --> 01:05:28,929
(sighs)

985
01:05:30,722 --> 01:05:32,808
Oh, come on in!

986
01:05:32,891 --> 01:05:35,102
How you doin'?

987
01:05:35,144 --> 01:05:37,187
(chattering)

988
01:05:47,698 --> 01:05:50,617
Tea, ladies,

989
01:06:02,754 --> 01:06:04,840
Now, I don't know what
you boys been up to,

990
01:06:04,923 --> 01:06:09,261
but I know mischief when I see it,
Now, I want an explanation, but first,

991
01:06:09,344 --> 01:06:12,931
I want you to get your fannies up here
with all y'all's period instruments,

992
01:06:13,015 --> 01:06:19,271
Now, I been tellin' the ladies about your
music, and they want to hear you play,

993
01:06:33,035 --> 01:06:36,455
- Professor?
- Yes, Lump?

994
01:06:36,705 --> 01:06:40,626
I can't really play the buttsack,

995
01:06:42,377 --> 01:06:44,254
(chattering stops)

996
01:06:44,338 --> 01:06:48,175
Madam, or rather, mesdames,

997
01:06:48,217 --> 01:06:51,136
you must accept our apologies
for not bein' able to perform,

998
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:53,305
for, as you see, we are shorthanded,

999
01:06:53,388 --> 01:06:56,016
Gawain is still at work,

1000
01:06:56,058 --> 01:06:58,977
and we could no more play
with one part tacit

1001
01:06:59,061 --> 01:07:02,815
than a horse could canter shy one leg,

1002
01:07:06,235 --> 01:07:09,363
Perhaps I could offer,

1003
01:07:09,404 --> 01:07:15,994
as a poor but ready substitute,
a brief poetic recital,

1004
01:07:16,078 --> 01:07:22,042
Though I do not pretend
to any great oratorical skills, (laughs)

1005
01:07:22,084 --> 01:07:25,629
I would be happy to present,
with your ladies' permission,

1006
01:07:26,588 --> 01:07:31,844
verse from the unquiet mind
of Mr, Edgar Allan Poe,

1007
01:07:39,434 --> 01:07:45,023
"Ladies, thy beauty is to me

1008
01:07:45,107 --> 01:07:48,777
Like those Nicean barks of yore,

1009
01:07:48,819 --> 01:07:57,119
That gently, o'er a perfumed sea,
The weary, wayward wanderer bore

1010
01:07:57,161 --> 01:08:00,873
To his own native shore,"

1011
01:08:00,956 --> 01:08:03,750
- (ladies sigh)
- My, my, my,

1012
01:08:04,209 --> 01:08:08,672
"On desperate seas long wont to roam,

1013
01:08:08,755 --> 01:08:15,137
Thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face,

1014
01:08:16,722 --> 01:08:20,350
Thy Naiad airs have brought me home

1015
01:08:20,434 --> 01:08:27,065
To the glory that was Greece
And the grandeur that was Rome,"

1016
01:08:28,025 --> 01:08:29,943
(tea lady #1) Glory hallelujah,

1017
01:08:29,985 --> 01:08:31,445
(all) Amen!

1018
01:08:37,659 --> 01:08:38,702
Hm?

1019
01:08:38,785 --> 01:08:42,289
(Dorr) Bye-bye, ladies,
It was, it was my pleasure,

1020
01:08:42,372 --> 01:08:45,876
- (tea lady #1) We have to do this again,
- (tea lady #2) Yes, we do got to,

1021
01:08:45,959 --> 01:08:48,837
Such a pleasure,
Safe home, Safe home,

1022
01:08:48,879 --> 01:08:50,380
(Mrs. Munson chuckles)

1023
01:08:50,464 --> 01:08:53,383
- Now I want to know what's goin' on,
- Oh, indeed, indeed,

1024
01:08:53,467 --> 01:08:56,762
The thirst for knowledge
is a very commendable thing,

1025
01:08:57,304 --> 01:09:02,768
Though I do believe that when you hear
the explanation you shall laugh riotously,

1026
01:09:02,851 --> 01:09:07,439
slappin' your knee and perhaps even
wipin' away a giddy tear,

1027
01:09:07,523 --> 01:09:09,733
relieved of your former concern,

1028
01:09:09,817 --> 01:09:13,403
Lump here is an avid collector
of Indian arrowheads,

1029
01:09:13,612 --> 01:09:18,033
and having found one
simply lying on your cellar floor -

1030
01:09:18,075 --> 01:09:20,327
- a particularly rare artifact
of the Natchez tribe? -

1031
01:09:20,369 --> 01:09:21,245
Nats, what?

1032
01:09:21,328 --> 01:09:25,582
He enlisted the entire ensemble in
an all-out effort to sift through the subsoil

1033
01:09:25,666 --> 01:09:27,334
in search of others,

1034
01:09:27,376 --> 01:09:30,921
And apparently, in doing so,
we hit a mother lode of natural gas,

1035
01:09:31,004 --> 01:09:34,675
I myself became acutely aware
of the smell of "rotten eggs,"

1036
01:09:34,716 --> 01:09:37,845
And it was just at this inopportune moment

1037
01:09:37,886 --> 01:09:42,432
that the General here
violated the cardinal rule of this house

1038
01:09:42,641 --> 01:09:47,563
- and lit himself a cigarette,
- So sorry,

1039
01:09:50,232 --> 01:09:53,610
Well, what about all that money?

1040
01:09:53,694 --> 01:09:54,695
Ah,

1041
01:09:55,988 --> 01:10:00,325
The money,
Well, the money is Mr, Pancake's,

1042
01:10:00,409 --> 01:10:03,996
- (clears throat) That's right,
- Who only just remortgaged his home

1043
01:10:04,079 --> 01:10:07,124
in order to raise the money
for a surgical procedure

1044
01:10:07,207 --> 01:10:11,044
that will correct the wandering eye
of his common-law wife, Mountain Water,

1045
01:10:11,086 --> 01:10:18,677
who suffers from astigmia, strabismus
and a general curdling of the vitreous jelly,

1046
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:24,099
Mr, Pancake is an ardent foe
of the Federal Reserve,

1047
01:10:24,183 --> 01:10:26,977
and is, in fact, one of those eccentrics
one often reads about

1048
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:29,021
hoardin' his entire life savings,

1049
01:10:29,104 --> 01:10:35,486
in Mr, Pancake 's case, in a Hefty bag
that is his constant companion,

1050
01:10:35,569 --> 01:10:41,408
- The Steel Sak,
- Don't trust the banks, Never have,

1051
01:10:50,292 --> 01:10:52,169
It don't smell right to me,

1052
01:10:52,252 --> 01:10:55,464
- I'm callin' Sheriff Wyner,
- No! Madam!

1053
01:10:55,506 --> 01:10:57,216
Please, please,
Madam!

1054
01:10:57,299 --> 01:11:00,052
No, no, I beg of,
Yes! Yes!

1055
01:11:00,135 --> 01:11:02,846
It is a lie!
It is a fantastic tale!

1056
01:11:02,930 --> 01:11:06,058
You have us dead to rights,
but, madam, please, please, please

1057
01:11:06,141 --> 01:11:10,187
allow me to tell you the truth in private,

1058
01:11:13,482 --> 01:11:15,651
Madam,

1059
01:11:19,112 --> 01:11:24,243
Madam, we are not musicians
of the late Renaissance,

1060
01:11:24,326 --> 01:11:27,496
Nor of the early, nor mid period,

1061
01:11:28,163 --> 01:11:32,376
We are, in fact,

1062
01:11:32,459 --> 01:11:34,628
criminals,

1063
01:11:34,670 --> 01:11:37,381
Desperate men, Mrs, Munson,

1064
01:11:37,464 --> 01:11:45,389
We have tunneled into the nearby offices
of the Bandit Queen gambling emporium

1065
01:11:45,472 --> 01:11:49,768
- and relieved it of its treasure,
- Lord have mercy,

1066
01:11:49,852 --> 01:11:51,019
It is true,

1067
01:11:51,103 --> 01:11:54,106
The Bandit Queen is a den of iniquity,

1068
01:11:54,189 --> 01:11:58,443
a painted harlot luring people into sin
by exciting the vice of greed

1069
01:11:58,527 --> 01:12:01,405
with her promise of easy winnings,
Oh, yes,

1070
01:12:01,488 --> 01:12:04,408
Her gains are ill-gotten,

1071
01:12:05,075 --> 01:12:12,666
But, I offer no excuses - save one,

1072
01:12:12,708 --> 01:12:17,087
We men have each pledged
one half of our share of the booty

1073
01:12:17,171 --> 01:12:18,922
to a charitable institution,

1074
01:12:19,006 --> 01:12:21,508
In compensation for the use of your home,

1075
01:12:21,550 --> 01:12:28,640
we had planned to donate a full share
to Bob Jones University,

1076
01:12:28,724 --> 01:12:33,145
without burdening you with guilty
knowledge by informing you of same,

1077
01:12:33,228 --> 01:12:37,065
But now you have wrested
the information from me,

1078
01:12:37,107 --> 01:12:40,527
There you have it,
It is on your table, Mrs, Munson,

1079
01:12:40,569 --> 01:12:44,156
The "awful truth,"

1080
01:12:44,239 --> 01:12:49,244
- Stolen money,
- But find the victim, Mrs, Munson,

1081
01:12:49,328 --> 01:12:53,415
I challenge you, Even the casino itself,
that riparian Gomorrah,

1082
01:12:53,499 --> 01:12:55,459
shall suffer no harm,

1083
01:12:55,542 --> 01:12:58,629
It has an insurance company,

1084
01:12:58,712 --> 01:13:04,092
A financial behemoth that will
cheerfully replenish its depleted vaults,

1085
01:13:04,134 --> 01:13:05,677
That is its function,

1086
01:13:05,761 --> 01:13:11,058
And that insurance company has tens
and tens of thousands of policyholders,

1087
01:13:11,099 --> 01:13:13,393
So that, We have done the calculations,
Mrs, Munson,

1088
01:13:13,435 --> 01:13:16,688
So that at the end of the day,
at the final reckoning,

1089
01:13:16,772 --> 01:13:22,152
each and every one of those policyholders
shall have contributed one penny,

1090
01:13:22,236 --> 01:13:28,242
One, single, solitary cent
to the satisfaction of this claim,

1091
01:13:28,283 --> 01:13:32,579
- One penny?
- One penny, Think of it, Mrs, Munson,

1092
01:13:32,621 --> 01:13:37,626
One penny from those thousands
upon thousands of people

1093
01:13:37,709 --> 01:13:44,132
so that Bob Jones University
can continue on its mission,

1094
01:13:44,174 --> 01:13:46,760
Why, I have no doubt that,
were those policy holders made aware

1095
01:13:46,844 --> 01:13:50,097
of the existence of that august institution,
each and every one of them

1096
01:13:50,139 --> 01:13:55,018
would have volunteered some token
amount for the furtherance of its aims,

1097
01:13:55,102 --> 01:13:57,020
Well, that's prob'ly true,

1098
01:13:57,104 --> 01:14:03,360
Sadly, the criminal stain
is upon my soul,

1099
01:14:03,443 --> 01:14:08,532
but the benefit shall accrue
to any number of worthy causes

1100
01:14:08,615 --> 01:14:13,954
as long, that is, as the secret
stays with us,

1101
01:14:16,456 --> 01:14:19,376
Well,

1102
01:14:19,459 --> 01:14:23,463
I can't hardly see the harm in it,

1103
01:14:24,464 --> 01:14:26,466
- One penny?
- (mouthing) One penny,

1104
01:14:38,437 --> 01:14:40,772
- I'm sorry,
- Excuse me?

1105
01:14:40,856 --> 01:14:44,276
No, I'm sorry, it's wrong, and don't you
be leadin' me into temptation,

1106
01:14:44,359 --> 01:14:47,446
- No, no, madam, I must strenuously,
- I'm sorry, it's just plain wrong,

1107
01:14:47,529 --> 01:14:48,780
- Stealin'!
- No, madam,

1108
01:14:48,864 --> 01:14:51,366
- I know your intentions was good,
- No, they weren't!

1109
01:14:51,450 --> 01:14:54,369
And I won't call the police
if you give back the money

1110
01:14:54,411 --> 01:14:56,288
and y'all go to church with me
next Sunday,

1111
01:14:56,371 --> 01:15:01,043
And engage in divine worship?!

1112
01:15:01,084 --> 01:15:04,087
I've made up my mind,

1113
01:15:04,171 --> 01:15:09,676
Now, you can doubletalk all you want,
It's church or the county jail,

1114
01:15:09,718 --> 01:15:13,388
Think it over,
I gotta feed the cat,

1115
01:15:23,232 --> 01:15:25,651
(plucks strings)

1116
01:15:31,406 --> 01:15:34,368
- Motherfuck!
- Yes,

1117
01:15:34,451 --> 01:15:37,955
Unfortunately, Mrs, Munson
has rather complicated the situation,

1118
01:15:38,038 --> 01:15:40,457
Yeah, well, I know how to decomplicate it,

1119
01:15:40,666 --> 01:15:45,587
You bust a cap in that old bitch's head,
everything be simple,

1120
01:15:48,131 --> 01:15:52,386
Not easy to do,
Many reasons,

1121
01:15:52,427 --> 01:15:56,348
Practical ones:
Quiet neighborhood, sleepy town,

1122
01:15:56,431 --> 01:15:59,393
Reasons of moral repugnance:
A harmless woman,

1123
01:15:59,476 --> 01:16:02,229
a deed conceived
and executed in cold blood,

1124
01:16:02,271 --> 01:16:05,691
Oh, no, Gawain,
would that it were simple,

1125
01:16:05,774 --> 01:16:09,194
Well, fuck, man! What we gonna do?
Give the money back and go to church?

1126
01:16:11,071 --> 01:16:14,449
I shudder,
I quake,

1127
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:17,744
You, sir, are a Buddhist,

1128
01:16:17,786 --> 01:16:20,247
Is there not a "middle" way?

1129
01:16:25,627 --> 01:16:29,256
Must float like a leaf on the river of life,

1130
01:16:30,924 --> 01:16:33,177
, and kill old lady,

1131
01:16:35,846 --> 01:16:38,807
Yes, yes, I suppose you are right,

1132
01:16:38,849 --> 01:16:42,936
It is the active nature of the crime,
though, that so abhors,

1133
01:16:42,978 --> 01:16:45,355
The squeezing of the trigger,
the plunging of the knife,

1134
01:16:47,983 --> 01:16:50,986
But, let us think a moment,

1135
01:16:51,069 --> 01:16:54,364
What other tools do we have at hand?

1136
01:16:54,448 --> 01:16:56,408
We have the cellar,

1137
01:16:56,492 --> 01:16:58,827
We have the cavity,

1138
01:16:58,869 --> 01:17:03,248
We have masonry and trowel,

1139
01:17:03,332 --> 01:17:09,963
Perhaps we could simply, immure her,

1140
01:17:10,005 --> 01:17:13,467
Sure, Easiest thing in the world, I can
whip up a little mortar in a snow saucer,

1141
01:17:13,509 --> 01:17:16,345
Lay the bricks,
Anchor in some chains,

1142
01:17:16,428 --> 01:17:18,138
Mountain Girl could outsource
the manacles,

1143
01:17:18,180 --> 01:17:21,642
Ah, gentlemen, gentlemen,
we delude ourselves,

1144
01:17:21,683 --> 01:17:25,646
No, shortest and painless is best,

1145
01:17:26,355 --> 01:17:32,903
Gawain's gun, retort muffled
by a pillow, into the brain,

1146
01:17:32,986 --> 01:17:34,488
(claps)
The affair of an instant,

1147
01:17:35,656 --> 01:17:40,994
The only question is
who wields the weapon?

1148
01:17:41,662 --> 01:17:45,833
I believe it is traditional
in such circumstances to draw straws,

1149
01:17:46,583 --> 01:17:49,628
Fair enough,
Here you go, Lump,

1150
01:17:50,879 --> 01:17:54,174
I'm thinkin', though,
that since I lost a finger -

1151
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:58,554
- and I mean literally lost it
'cause of that fuckin' cat -

1152
01:17:58,595 --> 01:18:01,974
maybe I should be
excused from this thing,

1153
01:18:02,057 --> 01:18:04,017
Hard for me to squeeze a trigger anyway,

1154
01:18:04,059 --> 01:18:06,311
You one whiny muthafucka,

1155
01:18:06,395 --> 01:18:09,606
I'll come over there and squeeze your
fuckin' nutsack, you keep that bullshit up,

1156
01:18:09,690 --> 01:18:11,108
Shut up, punk!

1157
01:18:11,191 --> 01:18:13,026
- I'll kick your goddamn ass, sweet-legs!
- Gentlemen!

1158
01:18:13,068 --> 01:18:15,696
No special pleading,
No exceptions,

1159
01:18:15,737 --> 01:18:19,366
It is of the nature of the situation
we would all prefer to be excused,

1160
01:18:20,450 --> 01:18:22,786
Well, OK, it was just a trial balloon,

1161
01:19:01,116 --> 01:19:06,079
Long straw, You all see it,
All that fuss for nothin', punk,

1162
01:19:06,121 --> 01:19:08,123
Fuck you,

1163
01:19:22,304 --> 01:19:23,430
Motherfuck!

1164
01:19:23,472 --> 01:19:26,308
Lord, I'm troubled

1165
01:19:26,475 --> 01:19:30,103
Lord, I'm troubled

1166
01:19:30,145 --> 01:19:35,359
Lord, I'm troubled
Oh, Lord, by my soul

1167
01:19:35,442 --> 01:19:43,158
My Lord, but when
I get up in the Kingdom, Lord

1168
01:19:43,951 --> 01:19:48,330
I wont be troubled no more

1169
01:19:48,413 --> 01:19:54,378
- Oh, Lord, I'm troubled
- Lord, I'm troubled

1170
01:19:54,461 --> 01:19:57,965
Lord, I'm troubled

1171
01:19:58,048 --> 01:20:01,844
- (TV) Oh, would you like a hot cross bun?
- No, just an explanation.

1172
01:20:01,885 --> 01:20:03,220
Coming up!

1173
01:20:03,303 --> 01:20:06,265
- Ouisie, I'll take some cocoa.
- Hi, George.

1174
01:20:06,348 --> 01:20:07,391
What's goin' on?

1175
01:20:07,474 --> 01:20:11,186
George!
How did they get in here?!

1176
01:20:11,270 --> 01:20:13,689
(raucous laughter)

1177
01:20:16,483 --> 01:20:19,278
- What you got there, Gawain?
- Why, nothin', Mama,

1178
01:20:19,361 --> 01:20:23,073
Nothin', my ass!
You got a dog there!

1179
01:20:23,157 --> 01:20:27,286
- No, Mama,
- A filthy, noisy little pest of a puppy dog

1180
01:20:27,369 --> 01:20:30,330
- gonna shit all over the house!
- He won't shit in the house, Mama,

1181
01:20:30,414 --> 01:20:33,000
I'm gonna train him, I promise,
I'll train him real good!

1182
01:20:33,083 --> 01:20:35,210
I'm gonna train you real good!

1183
01:20:35,294 --> 01:20:39,256
You wait till your daddy get home,
He gonna lay into you proper!

1184
01:20:39,339 --> 01:20:41,967
No, Mama! Please, Mama! I love you!

1185
01:20:42,050 --> 01:20:43,927
Your daddy gonna kick yo' ass!

1186
01:20:44,011 --> 01:20:46,180
Mama's whuppin' Gawain's ass!

1187
01:20:46,263 --> 01:20:48,474
Ain't you gonna use the strap, Mama?

1188
01:20:48,557 --> 01:20:52,561
I love you, Mama,
I'm sorry, Mama, I love you,

1189
01:20:52,644 --> 01:20:56,356
Yeah, I'll wipe the dog's ass
and everything, Mama,

1190
01:20:58,525 --> 01:21:00,444
I'll train him to shit in the toilet, Mama,

1191
01:21:00,527 --> 01:21:04,448
- I'll wipe his ass and everything, Mama,
- What you doin'?

1192
01:21:04,698 --> 01:21:07,326
What you doin' with my pillow?

1193
01:21:07,409 --> 01:21:08,452
Nothin', ma'am,
I just came down to get a,

1194
01:21:08,702 --> 01:21:10,913
- Ugh!
- I'm displeased with you!

1195
01:21:10,996 --> 01:21:12,789
- Yeah, but,
- Fine colored boy like you

1196
01:21:12,873 --> 01:21:15,918
- fallin' in with that trash downstairs!
- Ugh!

1197
01:21:16,001 --> 01:21:19,838
Now, I know your mama
taught you better than that!

1198
01:21:23,759 --> 01:21:27,805
I can't do it,
She remind me of my mama,

1199
01:21:27,888 --> 01:21:30,557
- Look, man,
- Why, this is most irregular,

1200
01:21:30,599 --> 01:21:32,851
, y'all muthafuckas
just gonna have to draw straws again,

1201
01:21:32,935 --> 01:21:36,021
Wait a minute, You've got to accept
your responsibilities, young man,

1202
01:21:36,104 --> 01:21:37,523
and shoot that old lady,

1203
01:21:37,606 --> 01:21:40,067
Hey, man, fuck you
and your irritated bowel!

1204
01:21:40,108 --> 01:21:41,318
Must shoot,

1205
01:21:41,401 --> 01:21:42,778
Now, look here,
it's the easiest thing in the world,

1206
01:21:42,861 --> 01:21:46,907
Just pretend her head's a casaba melon
and the gun is a melon baller,

1207
01:21:46,949 --> 01:21:49,368
What the fuck are you talkin' about?
A melon baller?

1208
01:21:49,451 --> 01:21:52,412
- Look, man, you do it,
- Oh, this is most irregular,

1209
01:21:52,496 --> 01:21:56,291
Now, look, with equal rights
comes equal responsibility,

1210
01:21:56,375 --> 01:21:59,211
I'm afraid Mr, Pancake is correct,
We cannot draw straws again,

1211
01:21:59,294 --> 01:22:04,049
The exercise would lose all credibility
if you show the loser can simply beg off,

1212
01:22:04,133 --> 01:22:05,968
Must shoot,

1213
01:22:07,344 --> 01:22:10,806
Hey, look, man,
she's just an old colored lady to you,

1214
01:22:10,889 --> 01:22:12,349
Come on, man, you do it,

1215
01:22:12,432 --> 01:22:17,354
- Why, you sniveling little coward,
- What did you say to me?

1216
01:22:17,437 --> 01:22:20,524
- Sniveling little coward,
- You whiny muthafucka,

1217
01:22:20,607 --> 01:22:23,777
I will come up yo' stankin',
irritated asshole with this gun

1218
01:22:23,819 --> 01:22:25,737
and give you a lead colonic,
muthafucka!

1219
01:22:25,821 --> 01:22:28,157
You think you scare me,
you mewling punk?

1220
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:32,077
You don't scare me, Bull Connor
and all his dogs didn't scare me!

1221
01:22:32,161 --> 01:22:34,246
Now, be a man,

1222
01:22:34,329 --> 01:22:38,000
You fuck!
You ain't no fuckin' man!

1223
01:22:38,083 --> 01:22:40,377
- Oh, my, this is most distressin',
- Be a man!

1224
01:22:40,460 --> 01:22:43,672
You ain't no fuckin' man!
Fuckin' a 60-year-old with pigtails!

1225
01:22:43,755 --> 01:22:47,509
Why, you bastard punk!
Mountain Girl is 53!

1226
01:22:47,676 --> 01:22:50,095
- She could ride your ass to jelly!
- Oh, yeah?!

1227
01:22:50,179 --> 01:22:51,680
(both grunting)

1228
01:22:51,763 --> 01:22:52,890
- Gentlemen, please!
- I seen Virginia hams

1229
01:22:52,973 --> 01:22:55,976
I'd rather stick my dick in
than that big ol' white chick!

1230
01:22:56,018 --> 01:22:57,436
(gunshot)

1231
01:23:03,442 --> 01:23:04,651
Oh, my God,

1232
01:23:04,693 --> 01:23:07,446
Oh, no,

1233
01:23:07,779 --> 01:23:08,906
Oh, my,

1234
01:23:09,865 --> 01:23:14,453
- I think he's hit,
- (Lump) Oh, no,

1235
01:23:17,331 --> 01:23:20,459
I'll just check the carotid artery,

1236
01:23:24,588 --> 01:23:27,508
- That's a negative,
- Is he dead, Professor?

1237
01:23:27,549 --> 01:23:30,302
Oh, sure he's dead, Lump,
I just checked his carotid artery,

1238
01:23:30,385 --> 01:23:32,971
(Dorr) Well, this is most irregular,

1239
01:23:34,389 --> 01:23:36,475
We shall need a Hefty bag,

1240
01:23:44,817 --> 01:23:46,777
She is in the kitchen,

1241
01:23:46,860 --> 01:23:52,366
You steal out with the carcass
while I dazzle her with conversation,

1242
01:23:56,995 --> 01:24:03,627
My dear Mrs, Munson, I have outlined
your position with my colleagues,

1243
01:24:03,710 --> 01:24:08,090
and I now return to you
to render our collective verdict,

1244
01:24:08,132 --> 01:24:13,387
There was much spirited discussion
and an atmosphere of frank give-and-take,

1245
01:24:13,428 --> 01:24:15,889
Some of our number
were initially appalled at your proposal

1246
01:24:15,931 --> 01:24:19,059
that we simply return the money,
Some were more receptive,

1247
01:24:19,101 --> 01:24:21,478
I don't care if they was receptive or not!

1248
01:24:21,562 --> 01:24:24,356
And that attitude, madam,
was a factor in our discussions,

1249
01:24:24,439 --> 01:24:28,360
To a man, I must say
they were devastated at the prospect

1250
01:24:28,443 --> 01:24:31,113
of not being able to contribute
to their respective charities,

1251
01:24:31,155 --> 01:24:33,240
- Well, that is a shame,
- Indeed,

1252
01:24:33,323 --> 01:24:37,286
but at the end of the day,
your position prevailed,

1253
01:24:37,369 --> 01:24:41,123
So we have decided to return the money,
every last cent of it,

1254
01:24:41,206 --> 01:24:45,043
and attend Sunday services, rather than
spend the remainder of our days

1255
01:24:45,127 --> 01:24:47,379
wastin' away at the Mississippi
Men's Correctional Facility,

1256
01:24:47,462 --> 01:24:48,463
(thud)

1257
01:24:48,672 --> 01:24:51,967
Though that was the original
preference of some,

1258
01:24:58,098 --> 01:25:00,434
(grunts)

1259
01:25:31,673 --> 01:25:34,176
You are not assistin' with the cadaver,

1260
01:25:34,843 --> 01:25:36,470
Oh, no need,

1261
01:25:36,512 --> 01:25:38,972
Just chuck it off the bridge,
Easiest thing in the world,

1262
01:25:39,014 --> 01:25:41,391
- I'm just cleanin' up here,
- (door shuts)

1263
01:25:41,475 --> 01:25:45,145
Oh! That's them,
Back already,

1264
01:25:45,187 --> 01:25:47,815
I'll just go dump these in the hearse,

1265
01:25:47,898 --> 01:25:51,485
Yeah, easiest thing in the world,

1266
01:26:07,751 --> 01:26:08,752
General!

1267
01:26:10,420 --> 01:26:12,548
No extra share, huh?

1268
01:26:18,053 --> 01:26:20,430
(grunts/stomach rumbling)

1269
01:26:35,737 --> 01:26:38,115
- Mountain?
- Garth?

1270
01:26:38,198 --> 01:26:39,783
(gasps)

1271
01:26:41,660 --> 01:26:45,164
- I, B, S, dear?
- (choking)

1272
01:26:47,416 --> 01:26:51,253
Oh, come

1273
01:26:51,295 --> 01:26:54,214
Let us go back

1274
01:26:55,424 --> 01:26:56,758
To God

1275
01:26:56,842 --> 01:27:01,138
- Go back to God
- Oh, come on

1276
01:27:01,221 --> 01:27:05,726
- Let's go back to God
- Let us go back

1277
01:27:05,767 --> 01:27:08,687
- Let's go back to God
- Come on

1278
01:27:08,770 --> 01:27:11,398
Let's go back to God

1279
01:27:11,607 --> 01:27:13,108
Get Garth,

1280
01:27:15,068 --> 01:27:19,198
Let us go back

1281
01:27:19,281 --> 01:27:20,824
To God

1282
01:27:20,908 --> 01:27:25,412
Go back to God

1283
01:27:39,009 --> 01:27:44,389
Excellent, I believe, at last,
we have the right man for the job,

1284
01:27:44,473 --> 01:27:47,768
(snoring)

1285
01:27:47,810 --> 01:27:50,479
("Weeping Mary")

1286
01:28:27,099 --> 01:28:29,685
(continues snoring)

1287
01:28:35,023 --> 01:28:41,321
They crucified the Savior

1288
01:28:42,489 --> 01:28:49,580
They crucified the Savior

1289
01:28:49,663 --> 01:28:56,628
They crucified the Savior

1290
01:28:56,712 --> 01:29:01,133
And nailed Him to the cross

1291
01:29:01,216 --> 01:29:03,093
(song continues)

1292
01:29:08,223 --> 01:29:10,517
(clock cuckoos)

1293
01:29:24,740 --> 01:29:26,325
(cat screeches)

1294
01:29:48,931 --> 01:29:50,682
(thunderclaps)

1295
01:29:50,766 --> 01:29:56,438
The old woman is a more formidable
antagonist than one had imagined,

1296
01:29:56,688 --> 01:29:59,024
(foghorn blowws)

1297
01:30:04,780 --> 01:30:07,157
(grunts)

1298
01:30:18,210 --> 01:30:20,754
Now, Lump,

1299
01:30:21,463 --> 01:30:25,425
it falls to you to finish the job,

1300
01:30:26,552 --> 01:30:29,888
- The comedy must end,
- You know,

1301
01:30:29,972 --> 01:30:35,602
- I've been doin' some thinkin', Professor,
- Oh, dear,

1302
01:30:35,644 --> 01:30:38,522
Maybe we should be goin' to church,
Maybe she is right,

1303
01:30:38,605 --> 01:30:42,734
Ooh, dear, Lump,
I feared those would be your words,

1304
01:30:42,818 --> 01:30:46,405
Not that I don't appreciate you giving
the matter the benefit of your thought,

1305
01:30:46,488 --> 01:30:50,409
but recall, my dear boy,
our respective functions in this enterprise,

1306
01:30:50,492 --> 01:30:55,414
I am a professor, The professor,
as you yourself so often say, The thinker,

1307
01:30:55,497 --> 01:30:57,875
Trained, in fact, in the arts of cogitation,

1308
01:30:57,958 --> 01:31:01,170
You, Lump, are the goon,
the hooligan, the dumb brute,

1309
01:31:01,253 --> 01:31:03,755
whose actions must be directed
by a higher intelligence,

1310
01:31:03,839 --> 01:31:05,299
Yeah, I know, but,

1311
01:31:05,340 --> 01:31:08,177
Ah, ah, ah! No buts, dear boy,
Do not repeat the error of thinkin',

1312
01:31:08,218 --> 01:31:14,558
Now is the moment of praxis,
Now, Lump, you must act,

1313
01:31:17,102 --> 01:31:21,648
Well, I can't do it, Professor,
A nice old lady like that,

1314
01:31:21,690 --> 01:31:24,860
Think of the riches, Lump,
that you and I alone shall divide,

1315
01:31:24,943 --> 01:31:26,069
Yeah, I know, but,

1316
01:31:26,153 --> 01:31:29,948
And reflect also that if you decline to act,
thus forcin' me to do so,

1317
01:31:30,032 --> 01:31:32,367
you shall no longer have
any entitlement to the money,

1318
01:31:32,451 --> 01:31:36,413
Your offices shall have been nugatory,

1319
01:31:36,497 --> 01:31:39,208
You mean you're gonna kill her?

1320
01:31:40,042 --> 01:31:43,462
Of course, yes,
My hand shall be forced,

1321
01:31:44,463 --> 01:31:46,757
I can't allow you to do that, Professor,

1322
01:31:48,967 --> 01:31:52,721
You,

1323
01:31:52,763 --> 01:31:54,723
allow?

1324
01:31:55,849 --> 01:31:57,267
Not allow?

1325
01:31:59,937 --> 01:32:02,314
What presumption!

1326
01:32:02,397 --> 01:32:04,650
You stupid boy!

1327
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:10,906
You very, very, extremely stupid boy,

1328
01:32:10,989 --> 01:32:13,116
Oh, yeah?

1329
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:16,119
Who looks stupid now?

1330
01:32:24,211 --> 01:32:25,379
No bullets?

1331
01:32:33,095 --> 01:32:37,057
Perhaps it had to be thus,

1332
01:32:39,226 --> 01:32:42,855
"Lo! In yon brilliant window-niche

1333
01:32:42,938 --> 01:32:45,983
How statue-like I see thee stand,"

1334
01:32:50,988 --> 01:32:53,574
A raven,

1335
01:33:02,541 --> 01:33:05,127
The agate lamp within thy hand!"

1336
01:33:06,462 --> 01:33:13,343
"Ah, Psyche, from the regions which

1337
01:33:13,427 --> 01:33:15,929
Are Holy Land!"

1338
01:34:23,622 --> 01:34:26,416
Professor?

1339
01:34:28,669 --> 01:34:32,965
Couldn't face the music,

1340
01:34:38,637 --> 01:34:42,808
I appreciate that, but we don't know
what to do, Tried that, too,

1341
01:34:42,891 --> 01:34:44,351
Oh,

1342
01:34:45,227 --> 01:34:48,856
- Uh, Mrs, Munson,
- Gotta make a statement, Sheriff,

1343
01:34:48,897 --> 01:34:51,358
Ma'am, could it possibly wait?
We're kinda busy down here today,

1344
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:56,238
Oh, well, I suppose it could wait,
but it's about that casino money,

1345
01:34:58,740 --> 01:35:01,869
Let me call you back,
You know somethin' about it?

1346
01:35:01,910 --> 01:35:04,496
Somethin'? Everything!
I got it at home,

1347
01:35:05,455 --> 01:35:09,418
- You got what at home?
- The money! $1,6 million dollars,

1348
01:35:09,459 --> 01:35:12,838
- It's down in my root cellar,
- How did it get there, Marva?

1349
01:35:12,921 --> 01:35:16,216
Well, a bunch of desperate men
stole it and put it there, that's how!

1350
01:35:16,258 --> 01:35:20,137
See, they was musicians
of the Renaissance period,

1351
01:35:20,220 --> 01:35:22,890
(chuckles) Turned out
they really couldn't play,

1352
01:35:22,931 --> 01:35:26,977
but they could recite poems
that'd break your heart,

1353
01:35:27,060 --> 01:35:30,814
- The ringleader spoke in dead tongues,
- Does he now?

1354
01:35:30,898 --> 01:35:32,733
Oh, I tried to get you to see him,

1355
01:35:32,774 --> 01:35:34,610
- That night,
- Yes, ma'am,

1356
01:35:34,693 --> 01:35:37,446
I had to holler at 'em
about stealin' all that money,

1357
01:35:38,280 --> 01:35:40,407
And I guess I made 'em feel real bad,

1358
01:35:40,449 --> 01:35:45,162
'cause they just picked up and left
without takin' the money!

1359
01:35:45,245 --> 01:35:49,041
And they let Pickles out!

1360
01:35:49,124 --> 01:35:51,001
So you want us to come over
and fetch him,

1361
01:35:51,084 --> 01:35:53,003
Oh, no, no, he's back,

1362
01:35:53,086 --> 01:35:55,964
What you want me to do with the money?

1363
01:35:59,718 --> 01:36:03,222
You keep it!
Why don't you keep it?

1364
01:36:04,431 --> 01:36:07,726
- Keep it?
- Go on and keep it, Miss Marva,

1365
01:36:10,813 --> 01:36:12,648
Well,

1366
01:36:13,649 --> 01:36:17,361
It is just a penny off of everybody's policy,

1367
01:36:21,907 --> 01:36:24,993
- Could,?

1368
01:36:25,077 --> 01:36:27,579
- You don't suppose I could,?
- Yes, ma'am?

1369
01:36:29,748 --> 01:36:33,210
Could I just give it all
to Bob Jones University?

1370
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:42,970
Yeah, That'd be nice,

1371
01:36:44,680 --> 01:36:48,725
Give it all to 'em!
That's a good idea!

1372
01:36:55,107 --> 01:36:59,194
As long as everybody knows,

How you doin'?

1375
