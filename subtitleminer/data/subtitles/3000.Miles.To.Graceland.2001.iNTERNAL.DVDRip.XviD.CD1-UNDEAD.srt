1
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,502
Nice car.

2
00:03:19,048 --> 00:03:20,879
Sweet!

3
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,456
Nice.

4
00:03:34,864 --> 00:03:36,764
You little maggot!

5
00:03:38,268 --> 00:03:40,600
- You get back here!
- What are you doing?

6
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:41,694
This your kid?

7
00:03:41,771 --> 00:03:45,138
Take a look at his hand.
You'll find the valve caps to my '59 Caddy.

8
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:46,800
Is that true, Jesse?

9
00:03:48,578 --> 00:03:52,912
How many times have I told you
to stop stealing parts off people's cars!

10
00:03:53,716 --> 00:03:55,684
Go on inside. Go!

11
00:04:01,457 --> 00:04:03,288
I'm really sorry about this.

12
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,751
You know how kids can be.

13
00:04:05,929 --> 00:04:07,624
That's all right. No harm done.

14
00:04:08,698 --> 00:04:11,064
Where are you from?
I've never seen you before.

15
00:04:11,134 --> 00:04:12,965
Just sort of passing through.

16
00:04:13,536 --> 00:04:17,199
I remember saying that very same thing.
That was about four years ago.

17
00:04:17,273 --> 00:04:18,331
You from L.A.?

18
00:04:18,408 --> 00:04:20,433
No, ma'am. Jersey City, mostly.

19
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:23,178
What's with this "ma'am" stuff?

20
00:04:23,947 --> 00:04:25,778
Am I looking that old already?

21
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:27,281
No, ma'am.

22
00:04:27,917 --> 00:04:30,511
- There you go again.
- I'm just playing around.

23
00:04:31,721 --> 00:04:33,279
I'm Cybil Waingrow.

24
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:35,821
Very nice name.

25
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,028
That's Cybil with a "C,"
not Sybil with an "S."

26
00:04:40,096 --> 00:04:41,222
Really?

27
00:04:41,631 --> 00:04:44,464
It's a pleasure to meet you, Cybil,
with or without a "C."

28
00:04:45,301 --> 00:04:47,428
It's nice to meet you. You drink coffee?

29
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:48,794
That's a start.

30
00:04:49,172 --> 00:04:50,264
You got any money?

31
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:58,169
Wow! Jersey's, like,
3,000 miles from here.

32
00:04:58,448 --> 00:05:00,643
Mom, can I have a Coke or something?

33
00:05:01,017 --> 00:05:02,609
Can't you see I'm talking?

34
00:05:02,685 --> 00:05:03,879
Mom, why can't...

35
00:05:03,953 --> 00:05:06,183
Sweetie, I didn't bring my purse with me.

36
00:05:08,658 --> 00:05:10,751
Hey, hang on a second.

37
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:13,050
Here.

38
00:05:13,997 --> 00:05:16,227
Go get yourself whatever you want.

39
00:05:16,532 --> 00:05:18,898
Wow, $5. Thanks, mister.

40
00:05:22,171 --> 00:05:23,968
- Hey, Dorth.
- Yeah, Jesse?

41
00:05:24,807 --> 00:05:25,796
You like kids?

42
00:05:26,175 --> 00:05:29,235
I'm not much the fathering type,
to tell you the truth.

43
00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:34,006
Austin, my ex, named him after
Jesse James, the bank robber.

44
00:05:34,117 --> 00:05:36,415
- Hell of a role model.
- That's what I said.

45
00:05:36,486 --> 00:05:37,885
I have $5.

46
00:05:38,621 --> 00:05:40,179
Where is Daddy now?

47
00:05:40,323 --> 00:05:41,790
I don't know.

48
00:05:41,858 --> 00:05:45,419
It's hard to keep track when you
write them and they don't write you back.

49
00:05:47,997 --> 00:05:49,487
Who cares, anyhow?

50
00:05:49,999 --> 00:05:51,227
Not me.

51
00:05:51,501 --> 00:05:53,560
Wow! You must think
I'm some cheap date.

52
00:05:54,203 --> 00:05:57,798
No, sir. I don't know how
you city folks work.

53
00:05:58,307 --> 00:06:02,710
But here, it takes a lot more than
a cup of coffee and a plate of chow...

54
00:06:02,912 --> 00:06:05,574
...to get a sophisticated woman like me
into the sack.

55
00:06:07,884 --> 00:06:09,112
That's for damn sure.

56
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:13,689
You do make that cigarette look good.

57
00:06:13,756 --> 00:06:16,190
- You make that dress look good.
- You're so sweet.

58
00:07:15,485 --> 00:07:20,149
Do I owe you anything? You know, like...

59
00:07:22,492 --> 00:07:24,790
I didn't mean to offend, I just...

60
00:07:25,995 --> 00:07:28,793
I haven't been with a woman
in a really long time, okay?

61
00:07:29,565 --> 00:07:31,089
- Right.
- I'm serious.

62
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:34,332
Like five-and-a-half-year serious,
you know what I mean?

63
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:36,060
Oh, my God!

64
00:07:36,939 --> 00:07:39,100
You just got out!

65
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:42,400
I'm sorry.

66
00:07:42,778 --> 00:07:45,212
Well, I guess we're even.

67
00:07:47,817 --> 00:07:48,875
Wait a minute.

68
00:07:48,951 --> 00:07:52,148
Michael, you don't offer a woman money
if it's been nice.

69
00:07:52,455 --> 00:07:55,390
You give her flowers or chocolate
or something.

70
00:07:55,858 --> 00:07:57,348
You know what I mean?

71
00:08:14,844 --> 00:08:15,708
Hey, Murph!

72
00:08:24,787 --> 00:08:26,721
This must be our singer.

73
00:08:27,123 --> 00:08:30,217
Yeah, because we know you can't sing.

74
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:32,758
Yeah, but I play a mean guitar.

75
00:08:35,398 --> 00:08:36,558
Mike.

76
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,333
Hey, man. You're looking...

77
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:41,960
- Yeah!
- You look good.

78
00:08:42,405 --> 00:08:44,600
- You feel good?
- Yeah.

79
00:08:46,008 --> 00:08:48,408
- Enjoying your freedom?
- Ain't free yet.

80
00:08:49,045 --> 00:08:51,912
Come on, it's a whole lot better
than that cage we shared.

81
00:08:51,981 --> 00:08:54,541
Big sky, lots of space.

82
00:08:54,717 --> 00:08:56,241
Not enough water.

83
00:08:58,154 --> 00:09:01,453
"Not enough water."
It'll always be something with you, Mike.

84
00:09:01,524 --> 00:09:03,355
Well, you know me.

85
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:07,626
Who's the kid?

86
00:09:09,065 --> 00:09:10,293
I don't know.

87
00:09:12,001 --> 00:09:13,696
Looks like he knows you.

88
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:19,036
Just because that kid is packing heat,
doesn't make him my partner.

89
00:09:19,442 --> 00:09:20,966
That's right.

90
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,571
I'm your partner.

91
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:28,572
Ready to play?

92
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,710
Always ready to play, Murph.

93
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:39,222
What's up, Michael?

94
00:09:39,295 --> 00:09:40,922
These your new girlfriends?

95
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,726
What's happening, man?

96
00:09:46,369 --> 00:09:47,358
Franklin.

97
00:09:48,471 --> 00:09:49,836
Get in the back.

98
00:09:54,577 --> 00:09:56,909
- Move over, Gus.
- I got window.

99
00:09:56,979 --> 00:09:59,914
Great, so I get bitch. That's nice.

100
00:10:06,622 --> 00:10:07,452
What's up?

101
00:10:09,258 --> 00:10:11,249
- Hey, kid.
- Yeah.

102
00:10:12,228 --> 00:10:14,287
You ever shoot anybody with them things?

103
00:10:17,733 --> 00:10:19,325
Didn't think so.

104
00:10:27,276 --> 00:10:28,436
Hey, Murphy.

105
00:10:28,577 --> 00:10:31,876
What's the smartest thing
ever come out of a bitch's mouth?

106
00:10:33,182 --> 00:10:35,377
- What?
- Einstein's cock!

107
00:10:42,091 --> 00:10:43,319
That's a good one.

108
00:10:47,797 --> 00:10:49,287
What are you so quiet about?

109
00:10:50,433 --> 00:10:52,060
I told you, I hate the desert.

110
00:10:52,668 --> 00:10:54,659
Yeah, I know, for the second time now.

111
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:55,965
Check it out!

112
00:10:56,205 --> 00:10:57,832
Deathmatch 3000.

113
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:00,501
In the red corner, Frank Sinatra.

114
00:11:00,676 --> 00:11:03,736
And in the blue corner, Elvis Presley.

115
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:06,848
I'm not talking about no cartoon shit.
The real deal!

116
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,781
Real cats scrapping it out!

117
00:11:08,884 --> 00:11:10,146
Who's going down?

118
00:11:10,219 --> 00:11:14,883
The Chairman of the Board and
the King are looking mighty mean tonight.

119
00:11:14,957 --> 00:11:18,415
I'll tell you, the King lands one
right in the Chairman's nuts!

120
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:20,687
- Hot tamale!
- There it is, baby.

121
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,127
But the King slips!

122
00:11:22,198 --> 00:11:26,157
He goes down and Ol' Blue Eyes goes in
for the Italian Necktie!

123
00:11:27,403 --> 00:11:28,995
The King is down!

124
00:11:29,171 --> 00:11:31,264
The King is down! No!

125
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,238
Fuck, man! Let me know
when you're going to do that.

126
00:11:37,313 --> 00:11:39,042
Who said "the King is down"?

127
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,475
- Let it go.
- Did I say something to you?

128
00:11:44,854 --> 00:11:46,549
Then shut the fuck up.

129
00:11:48,491 --> 00:11:49,958
Who said "the King is down"?

130
00:11:50,025 --> 00:11:52,516
- We were just having a little fun.
- I know.

131
00:11:53,162 --> 00:11:54,288
So, who said it?

132
00:11:54,363 --> 00:11:55,955
I said it, Murphy.

133
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:59,567
Don't say it any fucking more.

134
00:11:59,668 --> 00:12:02,603
- It was just a joke.
- Well, it wasn't fucking funny.

135
00:12:05,007 --> 00:12:05,974
Sinatra.

136
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:10,410
Fuck Sinatra. Nobody fucks with the King
and nobody ever says he's down.

137
00:12:11,247 --> 00:12:14,148
Hey, Murphy, we all love the King.

138
00:12:15,451 --> 00:12:19,182
That's right.
Elvis would beat Sinatra's ass!

139
00:12:20,189 --> 00:12:21,554
That's fucking right.

140
00:12:21,624 --> 00:12:24,559
What's the best thing
about dating homeless girls?

141
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,158
You can drop them off anywhere.

142
00:12:45,881 --> 00:12:47,075
Let me out!

143
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:49,710
Damn, my ass is all sweaty.

144
00:12:52,421 --> 00:12:53,581
Murph.

145
00:12:53,923 --> 00:12:55,550
Good to see you, Jack.

146
00:12:57,827 --> 00:12:59,454
Really good to see you.

147
00:12:59,628 --> 00:13:01,562
- Michael.
- Jack, how are you doing?

148
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,427
How does it feel to be out?

149
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,464
- You know how it feels.
- Yes, I do.

150
00:13:07,169 --> 00:13:09,660
- You got them?
- Inside.

151
00:13:11,307 --> 00:13:12,672
Hey, Franklin.

152
00:13:16,579 --> 00:13:20,015
Stop. You're killing me, man.
You're killing me.

153
00:13:20,282 --> 00:13:22,375
Pretty loose group you got there.

154
00:13:26,755 --> 00:13:29,019
- Don't shoot me!
- Dance, motherfucker!

155
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:31,757
- They dialed in?
- They're good on stage.

156
00:13:31,994 --> 00:13:33,791
It's going to be some show!

157
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:38,895
The snakeskin is mine.

158
00:13:39,768 --> 00:13:41,861
- I got that one.
- That's mine.

159
00:13:50,646 --> 00:13:51,840
Hey, Michael.

160
00:13:52,548 --> 00:13:54,277
It's good to see you.

161
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:56,477
- You want to come in?
- No, I can't.

162
00:13:57,019 --> 00:13:59,214
Really, I just wanted to ask you...

163
00:14:00,823 --> 00:14:03,053
Well, maybe for a second or two.

164
00:14:06,161 --> 00:14:08,322
You haven't seen my wallet,
by any chance?

165
00:14:08,397 --> 00:14:09,489
Your wallet?

166
00:14:09,565 --> 00:14:12,728
I had it yesterday when I paid the check
at the coffee shop.

167
00:14:12,801 --> 00:14:15,497
I was just backtracking my steps.

168
00:14:15,571 --> 00:14:17,402
Well, I haven't seen it.

169
00:14:18,707 --> 00:14:20,504
Jesse, get back here!

170
00:14:20,843 --> 00:14:22,811
Did you take this man's wallet?

171
00:14:22,878 --> 00:14:24,743
Don't shut that door on me!

172
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,175
Don't lock it.

173
00:14:29,718 --> 00:14:31,549
He does this all the time. Sorry.

174
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:34,919
Would you hand me that little stepladder
over there, please?

175
00:14:37,426 --> 00:14:38,723
Thank you.

176
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:45,296
He's like a ferret. Takes anything
he can get his hands on and hides it all...

177
00:14:46,168 --> 00:14:47,601
...up...

178
00:14:47,903 --> 00:14:48,961
...here.

179
00:14:55,377 --> 00:14:57,106
Sorry about this.

180
00:14:58,681 --> 00:15:00,080
There was...

181
00:15:00,282 --> 00:15:01,146
Money?

182
00:15:01,216 --> 00:15:03,150
$460, yeah.

183
00:15:17,032 --> 00:15:18,431
Is this it?

184
00:15:20,202 --> 00:15:21,328
Just about.

185
00:15:21,403 --> 00:15:22,927
Sorry for all the trouble.

186
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,768
He really isn't a bad kid.

187
00:15:27,309 --> 00:15:29,140
I'm sure he's an angel.

188
00:15:34,216 --> 00:15:35,444
Wait a minute.

189
00:15:36,085 --> 00:15:38,781
- I can get your money back.
- It's okay. It's just...

190
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:40,185
...$20.

191
00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:41,686
How about...

192
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:45,384
...I'll pay it back to you
with another cup of coffee?

193
00:17:09,545 --> 00:17:11,274
Time to go to work, baby.

194
00:17:13,148 --> 00:17:14,308
Let's do it.

195
00:18:30,659 --> 00:18:33,287
<i>Here we are</i>
<i>at the Riviera Hotel and Casino...</i>

196
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,421
<i>...and it's International Elvis Week.</i>

197
00:18:58,487 --> 00:19:00,352
I don't know what the big deal is.

198
00:19:00,422 --> 00:19:02,947
That porker has been dead
for 20 years now.

199
00:19:03,192 --> 00:19:04,523
He was a god.

200
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:06,921
And second, he ain't dead.

201
00:19:07,196 --> 00:19:09,426
We've gone from Rat Pack to Fat Pack.

202
00:19:45,234 --> 00:19:46,223
Murphy.

203
00:19:47,903 --> 00:19:49,700
Long time no see.

204
00:19:49,805 --> 00:19:50,863
Back off.

205
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,067
Watch yourself, son.

206
00:19:56,511 --> 00:19:58,240
That's no way to treat your friends.

207
00:19:58,313 --> 00:20:01,248
I never met you in my life.
Be smart and take a fucking walk.

208
00:20:01,316 --> 00:20:04,012
Hey, man, now come on, don't be cruel.

209
00:20:42,724 --> 00:20:43,986
Would you?

210
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:49,589
Thank you.

211
00:21:16,224 --> 00:21:17,851
Honey, doesn't he look marvelous?

212
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:22,720
We think you look just marvelous!

213
00:21:23,832 --> 00:21:25,299
Thank you, ma'am.

214
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:27,028
Thank you very much.

215
00:21:32,007 --> 00:21:33,099
Sorry.

216
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,733
What's the problem?

217
00:21:59,935 --> 00:22:02,028
Emergency stop on nine.

218
00:22:05,374 --> 00:22:07,035
Probably some couple screwing again.

219
00:22:10,045 --> 00:22:11,307
Do we have visual?

220
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:14,349
No. Sir, the camera in car eight is down.

221
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:18,284
Switch to override. Bring it down for
a security check. Have security waiting.

222
00:22:40,842 --> 00:22:43,208
All right, everybody stay cool.

223
00:22:44,379 --> 00:22:46,370
Back up.

224
00:23:00,362 --> 00:23:02,523
White is light, red is dead.

225
00:23:13,075 --> 00:23:16,044
I'm only going to say this once.
Who is listening?

226
00:23:16,111 --> 00:23:17,408
I am.

227
00:23:33,562 --> 00:23:35,086
In the corner, now.

228
00:23:35,964 --> 00:23:39,798
Get on your knees, put your heads
on the ground. What's your problem?

229
00:23:39,868 --> 00:23:41,335
What's your problem?

230
00:23:42,104 --> 00:23:43,594
He's deaf!

231
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:47,301
Well, you're not.
Put his head on the fucking ground.

232
00:23:52,314 --> 00:23:54,714
$50s and $100s, no cellophane.

233
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,287
Holy shit!

234
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,490
Main booth, scramble security.

235
00:24:03,558 --> 00:24:05,253
Call Vegas P.D. We need backup.

236
00:24:06,628 --> 00:24:08,220
- Shut up.
- Shut up!

237
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:10,457
Let's go. Come on, Gus.

238
00:24:12,334 --> 00:24:13,824
Come on, Gus!

239
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:16,501
Let's go, Gus.

240
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:19,238
That's enough!

241
00:24:21,309 --> 00:24:24,574
They're coming out. Do not engage
on floor, direct them to B-41.

242
00:24:24,646 --> 00:24:26,273
<i>Intercept there. B-4-1.</i>

243
00:24:34,189 --> 00:24:35,588
They're at Registration.

244
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,327
<i>Vegas P.D. en route.</i>

245
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,034
Right at VIP.

246
00:24:49,171 --> 00:24:51,139
Let me know if they follow, Hanson.

247
00:24:52,274 --> 00:24:53,741
<i>Station 3, where are you?</i>

248
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:58,572
They're coming.

249
00:25:00,348 --> 00:25:01,679
Nothing'll happen here.

250
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:03,440
Left at dollar slots.

251
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:07,611
Relax, Gus.

252
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:09,181
They're moving us.

253
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,119
Anyone gets between us and Michael,
it's on.

254
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:27,870
They're in B-41.

255
00:25:37,586 --> 00:25:39,611
Freeze! Hold it right there.

256
00:25:44,693 --> 00:25:46,524
Everyone we got, now, scramble!

257
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,230
Go!

258
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:56,103
Give me the fucking camera!

259
00:26:45,153 --> 00:26:46,245
Missed me, bitch!

260
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:58,088
Come on!

261
00:27:58,493 --> 00:28:01,621
Let's go! Franklin, let's go!

262
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:21,107
Come on!

263
00:28:27,489 --> 00:28:28,922
Knock them down, Michael!

264
00:28:44,372 --> 00:28:45,304
Let's go!

265
00:28:46,708 --> 00:28:48,198
Freeze! Vegas P.D.!

266
00:29:01,623 --> 00:29:02,521
Get the gun!

267
00:29:12,567 --> 00:29:14,398
Take us up, Mike!

268
00:29:16,438 --> 00:29:17,632
Franklin is hit!

269
00:29:19,908 --> 00:29:22,433
Franklin, come on! You'll make it!

270
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,920
Fifteen, one to go!

271
00:29:35,056 --> 00:29:36,045
Clear!

272
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:43,853
Where the hell is he?

273
00:29:44,966 --> 00:29:46,695
Christ, Murph, what's the deal?

274
00:29:46,935 --> 00:29:48,129
Fuck!

275
00:29:48,336 --> 00:29:49,496
He'll be here.

276
00:29:49,838 --> 00:29:51,897
"Just slip out the back, Jack

277
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:54,331
"Make a new plan, Stan

278
00:29:54,509 --> 00:29:56,500
"You don't need to be coy, Roy

279
00:29:56,611 --> 00:29:58,579
"Just listen to me

280
00:29:59,481 --> 00:30:03,440
"Hop on the bus, Gus
You don't need to discuss much

281
00:30:03,952 --> 00:30:09,015
"Just drop off the key, Lee
And set yourself free"

282
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,635
Helicopter!

283
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:06,671
Let's go!

284
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:34,469
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>Elvis has left the building!</i>

285
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:43,244
Hang in there!

286
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:46,185
- You're going to make it!
- You're going to be okay, Franklin!

287
00:31:52,627 --> 00:31:53,525
I'm dying!

288
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,729
- Put pressure on it!
- I'm dying, man!

289
00:31:58,533 --> 00:31:59,795
I won't make it!

290
00:32:01,069 --> 00:32:01,899
Hang on!

291
00:32:02,437 --> 00:32:03,927
Help me!

292
00:32:26,227 --> 00:32:27,455
Is he gonna make it?

293
00:32:35,637 --> 00:32:36,661
Fuck him.

294
00:33:51,579 --> 00:33:52,568
How you doing?

295
00:34:37,125 --> 00:34:38,990
Where is the pisser?

296
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,355
- Nice place you got here.
- A real shit hole.

297
00:34:54,275 --> 00:34:55,537
Gus, give me a hand.

298
00:34:59,781 --> 00:35:01,078
Oh, yeah.

299
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:03,480
That's a lot of money.

300
00:35:39,987 --> 00:35:41,750
$3.2 million.

301
00:35:41,823 --> 00:35:44,451
$3.2 million?

302
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:47,020
That's a beautiful thing.

303
00:35:47,094 --> 00:35:48,959
Less Jack's 10 percent.

304
00:35:50,832 --> 00:35:51,662
Right.

305
00:35:52,867 --> 00:35:53,526
Damn.

306
00:35:54,769 --> 00:35:57,101
That's a lot of money
just to fly a helicopter.

307
00:35:57,171 --> 00:35:59,833
Would you rather we used
a hot air balloon?

308
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:01,730
No.

309
00:36:01,809 --> 00:36:05,245
Or maybe hang gliders?
Would you rather we used hang gliders?

310
00:36:05,313 --> 00:36:07,304
I don't know what a hang glider is.

311
00:36:07,381 --> 00:36:10,578
I doubt you know how to fly
a fucking helicopter, either.

312
00:36:10,885 --> 00:36:14,048
If you ask me, $320,000 is well worth it.

313
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:17,016
Besides, Jack has
taken care of a lot of shit...

314
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:19,184
...you don't know anything about.

315
00:36:20,228 --> 00:36:21,786
All right. Back to business.

316
00:36:24,332 --> 00:36:26,129
Where is Franklin's pile?

317
00:36:27,668 --> 00:36:29,135
What are you talking about?

318
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:31,661
Franklin. Anybody remember him?

319
00:36:34,041 --> 00:36:35,770
I was there. Franklin is dead.

320
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:38,740
Right. So, where is Franklin's pile?

321
00:36:40,681 --> 00:36:43,707
Well, Murph, we don't make him a pile.
We split up four ways.

322
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:46,518
Wrong. Franklin's pile
does not get split up.

323
00:36:51,092 --> 00:36:52,821
Sure, I'm good with that.

324
00:36:53,227 --> 00:36:56,663
Bullshit!
Who gets the remaining 15 percent, then?

325
00:36:56,764 --> 00:36:59,062
- Let me guess.
- It was my deal, Hanson.

326
00:36:59,734 --> 00:37:03,795
No, I want that 15 percent
split up four ways.

327
00:37:04,672 --> 00:37:06,572
- You want?
- Yeah, I want.

328
00:37:08,409 --> 00:37:10,741
Well, I could give a flying fuck
what you want.

329
00:37:11,379 --> 00:37:13,404
A deal is a deal.

330
00:37:13,848 --> 00:37:15,577
Let me put it this way.

331
00:37:16,083 --> 00:37:19,541
That fucking deal died with Franklin.
Now, it's time to make a new deal.

332
00:37:21,789 --> 00:37:24,155
That's a commitment, Hanson.
I'll give you that.

333
00:37:25,092 --> 00:37:28,823
Fuck it. We shot everybody in the casino,
let's start shooting each other.

334
00:37:30,631 --> 00:37:34,761
Come on, you guys, let's just settle down,
all right? We don't need this.

335
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:38,097
Gus is right. Let's just keep this simple.

336
00:37:38,205 --> 00:37:42,505
I'll take my 15 percent, plus 25 percent
of Franklin's end, and I'll take it now.

337
00:37:42,576 --> 00:37:45,136
- I'm not letting that happen.
- Why the hell not?

338
00:37:45,212 --> 00:37:48,010
Because that would change the plan,
and when plans change...

339
00:37:48,082 --> 00:37:49,481
...things get fucked up!

340
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:53,008
- You'll have to learn to be more flexible.
- The plan stays!

341
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:55,781
We have an arrangement in Twin Falls...

342
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:59,223
...where we'll get 70 cents on the dollar.
We'll keep that arrangement.

343
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,554
All of us.

344
00:38:00,628 --> 00:38:04,724
After that, I'm over the border into Canada
and you can all get on Michael's boat...

345
00:38:04,799 --> 00:38:05,993
...for all I care.

346
00:38:06,067 --> 00:38:08,865
No. Nobody gets on my boat but me.

347
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:10,430
Right.

348
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:11,596
Whatever.

349
00:38:11,672 --> 00:38:15,005
If anyone goes before then,
there's a chance you'll spend the money.

350
00:38:15,076 --> 00:38:17,203
You spend the money, you'll get popped.

351
00:38:17,278 --> 00:38:19,246
And the chances are you'll talk.

352
00:38:19,313 --> 00:38:21,747
Either way, I'm not taking that chance.

353
00:38:22,183 --> 00:38:26,483
Murph, I've been doing this a long time
and I've never dropped dime on anybody.

354
00:38:26,587 --> 00:38:30,250
Want to keep blowing smoke in my face,
or you want me to blow your head off?

355
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:41,532
You go do whatever it is you got to do
in Twin Falls or wherever.

356
00:38:41,602 --> 00:38:43,069
That's your criminal right.

357
00:38:43,471 --> 00:38:44,995
Me, I'm staying right here.

358
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:48,166
You both have hot sheets.
Instead of traveling with you...

359
00:38:48,476 --> 00:38:51,877
...I should be putting as much distance
from you as humanly possible.

360
00:38:51,946 --> 00:38:54,881
Traveling with you fucks
is the weakest part of the plan.

361
00:38:54,949 --> 00:38:59,010
But since we don't trust each other,
we'll travel north together as a group.

362
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:02,578
So, try to think of us as the Osmonds,
only we don't fucking get along.

363
00:39:07,161 --> 00:39:09,755
Gentlemen, as far as I'm concerned,
this job is done.

364
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:12,162
I'm cashing out.
Just give me my fucking money.

365
00:39:13,034 --> 00:39:14,365
Is that an order?

366
00:39:14,568 --> 00:39:17,162
No, come on, that wasn't an order.

367
00:39:17,238 --> 00:39:19,229
I mean, technically it wasn't.

368
00:39:19,306 --> 00:39:22,002
- What about you, Gus?
- What?

369
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:24,540
You think this is your fucking money?

370
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:28,378
No, no. This is my money.
That's your money.

371
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:30,039
Michael.

372
00:39:30,651 --> 00:39:32,949
I just want to get on the move, Murph.

373
00:39:34,188 --> 00:39:37,453
Makes you the only fucking pig
in the room, Hanson.

374
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:57,004
You make me laugh, you know?

375
00:39:57,078 --> 00:39:59,911
I can't imagine what goes through
that sick mind of yours.

376
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:03,416
Sometimes I actually think you believe
you're the King himself.

377
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:06,817
What is it with those side burns?
I glued mine on for the job.

378
00:40:06,887 --> 00:40:09,219
For you, it's an actual lifestyle choice.

379
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:10,780
- Shut up.
- I'm serious!

380
00:40:10,858 --> 00:40:11,847
Shut up.

381
00:40:12,259 --> 00:40:13,556
It's fucking sad, man.

382
00:40:14,695 --> 00:40:17,391
Nevertheless, I do know the golden rule.

383
00:40:17,631 --> 00:40:19,121
And what's that, sweetheart?

384
00:40:21,302 --> 00:40:22,291
Fuck the gold.

385
00:40:28,442 --> 00:40:30,171
He who has the nickel plating...

386
00:40:30,244 --> 00:40:31,677
...makes the rules.

387
00:40:31,745 --> 00:40:32,837
You shot him!

388
00:40:32,913 --> 00:40:36,508
That's right, Gus.
Now, I'm going to kill him.

389
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:39,445
Sweetheart.

390
00:40:48,329 --> 00:40:49,626
Wrap him up.

391
00:40:53,167 --> 00:40:54,327
Wrap him up.

392
00:40:57,404 --> 00:40:58,837
Wrap him up!

393
00:41:06,013 --> 00:41:07,310
Fuck!

394
00:41:08,015 --> 00:41:09,573
- Anybody?
- No.

395
00:41:11,652 --> 00:41:14,951
We need some towels!
He's bleeding all over the place.

396
00:41:25,666 --> 00:41:26,792
Hey, Murph.

397
00:41:27,468 --> 00:41:29,959
How are we going to
split up the money now?

398
00:42:26,193 --> 00:42:29,162
Hey, this boy is heavy.

399
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:33,494
I think he had one too many peanut butter
and fried banana sandwiches.

400
00:43:01,428 --> 00:43:02,417
God!

401
00:43:44,271 --> 00:43:46,000
Need a ride, fella?

402
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:47,696
Thanks.

403
00:43:58,485 --> 00:43:59,474
Fuck!

404
00:44:31,318 --> 00:44:35,254
<i>A raid as wild and as daring as</i>
<i>anything seen on the American landscape.</i>

405
00:44:35,823 --> 00:44:40,157
<i>The Riviera Hotel and Casino</i>
<i>exploded today in a shower of gunfire...</i>

406
00:44:40,227 --> 00:44:43,094
<i>...during the International Elvis Convention.</i>

407
00:44:45,966 --> 00:44:47,194
Where's Jesse?

408
00:44:48,836 --> 00:44:50,599
Come here, you little shit!

409
00:44:50,671 --> 00:44:51,968
What the hell...

410
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:56,769
Where is it? Where is that damn money?

411
00:44:56,844 --> 00:45:00,803
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I'm calling the cops right now.

412
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:26,201
<i>911 operator. Please state your name</i>
<i>and location of the emergency.</i>

413
00:45:26,273 --> 00:45:27,433
Yes, hello.

414
00:45:27,674 --> 00:45:28,663
<i>Hello?</i>

415
00:45:31,078 --> 00:45:32,739
<i>This is the 911 operator.</i>

416
00:45:35,549 --> 00:45:36,948
<i>Hello, ma'am?</i>

417
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:39,145
<i>Ma'am?</i>

418
00:45:40,788 --> 00:45:43,052
I thought you might change your mind.

419
00:45:45,092 --> 00:45:46,719
Where did you get that?

420
00:45:52,132 --> 00:45:56,501
You're the one. The casino in Vegas.
It's all over the news.

421
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:57,868
That's you.

422
00:46:04,445 --> 00:46:06,538
- Get over there and sit down.
- Go.

423
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:22,358
That's $100,000 in there.

424
00:46:22,930 --> 00:46:24,864
Just for you to keep your mouth shut.

425
00:46:27,134 --> 00:46:29,602
You don't have to pay me off,
I won't tell anybody.

426
00:46:34,141 --> 00:46:35,733
No, you're not.

427
00:46:37,344 --> 00:46:39,073
All I need is a couple of days.

428
00:46:39,146 --> 00:46:41,979
After that, you can do
whatever the hell you want.

429
00:46:44,985 --> 00:46:46,418
Everything is understood?

430
00:46:47,788 --> 00:46:48,812
I got it.

431
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,380
Well.

432
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:00,359
Hey, Elvis.

433
00:47:03,871 --> 00:47:06,772
Is there any chance that
I might be able to see you again?

434
00:47:08,642 --> 00:47:10,007
Sorry, Cybil.

435
00:47:10,444 --> 00:47:12,275
Are you 100 percent sure of that?

436
00:47:12,679 --> 00:47:14,442
Yeah, 100,000 percent.

437
00:47:35,369 --> 00:47:37,337
- I need your car.
- What?

438
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:40,372
Yeah, the old Valiant out there.
Where are the keys?

439
00:47:40,474 --> 00:47:42,305
I'm not giving that to you.

440
00:47:42,409 --> 00:47:45,276
Yeah, you are.
Because I just gave you $100,000 for it.

441
00:47:45,846 --> 00:47:48,144
I don't care how much you just gave me.

442
00:47:48,215 --> 00:47:50,547
Anyway, it's not my car.
It's my grandmother's.

443
00:47:51,518 --> 00:47:54,248
- You either give me the keys right now...
- Or what?

444
00:47:54,321 --> 00:47:55,754
You're going to kill us?

445
00:47:55,989 --> 00:47:58,389
You know, there is a simple solution here.

446
00:47:58,458 --> 00:48:00,449
Yeah, there is.

447
00:48:01,361 --> 00:48:02,794
You can take us with you.

448
00:48:04,264 --> 00:48:05,458
What?

449
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:07,391
Why not? Where are you going?

450
00:48:08,168 --> 00:48:09,726
I haven't got time for this.

451
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:11,998
You got three seconds to get me
those keys...

452
00:48:12,072 --> 00:48:15,007
...or I'll splatter cherry pie
on that wall behind you and...

453
00:48:15,075 --> 00:48:17,566
...I'm dead serious about that. One, two...

454
00:48:18,278 --> 00:48:20,041
Stop pointing that gun at my mom.

455
00:48:27,254 --> 00:48:28,619
Who's there?

456
00:48:29,089 --> 00:48:31,785
It's the police.
Can you open the door, please?

457
00:48:35,662 --> 00:48:37,289
Mom, money!

458
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:40,960
Sit down.

459
00:48:42,769 --> 00:48:44,293
Sit down!

460
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,439
Mom, get the door.

461
00:48:51,578 --> 00:48:53,011
Can I help you?

462
00:48:53,113 --> 00:48:56,913
Evening. We received
an emergency 911 call from this room.

463
00:48:57,084 --> 00:48:58,312
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

464
00:48:58,385 --> 00:49:01,149
The call was disconnected.
We were in the neighborhood.

465
00:49:01,221 --> 00:49:02,586
Everything okay?

466
00:49:03,156 --> 00:49:05,681
Yeah, it's fine.
We were just fixing to leave.

467
00:49:05,759 --> 00:49:07,351
Can we come in, ma'am?

468
00:49:08,428 --> 00:49:09,520
Of course you can.

469
00:49:09,930 --> 00:49:14,230
<i>...Elvis impersonators made it up the</i>
<i>elevator and to the roof where they were...</i>

470
00:49:14,301 --> 00:49:17,270
<i>...taken by helicopter,</i>
<i>we don't know where.</i>

471
00:49:18,939 --> 00:49:20,839
Are you the man of the house?

472
00:49:22,275 --> 00:49:23,765
We just got engaged.

473
00:49:25,112 --> 00:49:28,047
- Congratulations.
- Thank you. We're really excited about it.

474
00:49:28,115 --> 00:49:30,310
We're about to go on a trip
to the Grand Canyon.

475
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:33,251
- Jesse, why don't you go get your stuff?
- Okay.

476
00:49:35,322 --> 00:49:37,256
Well, I'll be right back.

477
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:43,719
So, which of you is
the one who dialed 911?

478
00:49:53,473 --> 00:49:54,735
I'm sorry.

479
00:49:54,808 --> 00:49:59,006
I was trying to dial 411 for information
and I dialed 9 by mistake.

480
00:50:01,348 --> 00:50:03,441
Well, I guess we're all set here.

481
00:50:03,817 --> 00:50:06,047
- We'll be on our way.
- So are we.

482
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:07,481
Come on.

483
00:50:09,656 --> 00:50:12,147
Ma'am, can I give you a hand
with your bag?

484
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:17,096
If you wouldn't mind. It's really heavy.
We got a lot of schoolbooks.

485
00:50:17,164 --> 00:50:18,859
It would be my pleasure.

486
00:50:21,001 --> 00:50:22,525
We'll be right there.

487
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:28,571
Come on.

488
00:50:39,753 --> 00:50:41,084
Bye-bye!

489
00:51:09,082 --> 00:51:11,016
You guys are federal marshals?

490
00:51:11,284 --> 00:51:14,276
If we're not,
we'd better give these fuckers back.

491
00:51:14,755 --> 00:51:16,086
Good morning.

492
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:19,053
Not for them it isn't.

493
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:21,725
'Morning. Vegas Homicide.

494
00:51:21,895 --> 00:51:23,226
What do you got, Vegas?

495
00:51:25,098 --> 00:51:26,531
No IDs.

496
00:51:26,867 --> 00:51:30,166
Looks like this one was digging,
trying to bury the one in the sheet.

497
00:51:30,237 --> 00:51:33,138
Someone drilled them from the front.
Double taps to the heart.

498
00:51:33,206 --> 00:51:36,073
Three spent .45 casings,
probably more in the sand.

499
00:51:36,977 --> 00:51:39,138
And this is interesting.

500
00:51:39,579 --> 00:51:41,547
.45 slug, slightly deformed.

501
00:51:43,683 --> 00:51:44,945
Vest.

502
00:52:14,447 --> 00:52:16,142
Tell me something, Cybil.

503
00:52:16,249 --> 00:52:18,717
How did that money get up there
in that ceiling?

504
00:52:18,785 --> 00:52:21,083
What do you mean? Jesse put it up there.

505
00:52:21,154 --> 00:52:24,021
It's a little heavy for him
to get up there all by himself.

506
00:52:24,424 --> 00:52:25,652
You're so paranoid.

507
00:52:25,725 --> 00:52:28,819
Yeah, I'm paranoid, because I think
you tried to steal my money.

508
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:33,495
You don't deserve the money, anyway.
You're just an amateur.

509
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:37,264
If you're such a pro, you know stealing it
wouldn't have done you any good.

510
00:52:37,337 --> 00:52:39,897
The money is marked,
Miss I-Got-It-All-Figured-Out.

511
00:52:39,973 --> 00:52:42,100
- You're lying.
- Am I?

512
00:52:42,175 --> 00:52:44,405
The news said the money was untraceable.

513
00:52:44,477 --> 00:52:46,342
- The news?
- And the news doesn't lie.

514
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:47,937
I'm sure they said that.

515
00:52:48,014 --> 00:52:51,882
That way, when the idiots who stole it
try to spend it, they get caught.

516
00:52:51,952 --> 00:52:54,318
You want to know why, Cybil with a "C"?

517
00:52:54,454 --> 00:52:57,719
Because they were dumb shits
and they listened to the news.

518
00:52:59,659 --> 00:53:02,127
- I never thought about it that way.
- I guess not.

519
00:53:10,637 --> 00:53:15,006
All right, here we go. I'm pulling off here.
I can't drive anymore. I got to sleep.

520
00:53:51,878 --> 00:53:53,072
Can I help you?

521
00:53:54,281 --> 00:53:56,181
Can you pump gas?

522
00:53:57,250 --> 00:54:00,219
Good, because nobody does anymore.
Fill it up.

523
00:54:02,222 --> 00:54:04,190
You all be cool now.

524
00:54:07,894 --> 00:54:09,589
Man, what happened to your nose?

525
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:11,319
What happened to your hair?

526
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:15,461
We just came from another interrogation.

527
00:54:15,535 --> 00:54:18,629
Which reminds me.
Quig, why do they call it a head-butt?

528
00:54:18,738 --> 00:54:22,504
It's not like I knocked that prick out
by slamming my forehead into his ass.

529
00:54:23,209 --> 00:54:24,301
Yeah, that's true.

530
00:54:26,313 --> 00:54:28,338
I would have come forward sooner...

531
00:54:28,415 --> 00:54:31,043
...but I was busy getting my beak mended.

532
00:54:31,151 --> 00:54:33,711
I heard about the robbery after the surgery.

533
00:54:33,787 --> 00:54:36,415
I put two and two together and here I am,
in the flesh.

534
00:54:36,489 --> 00:54:39,253
- I'll tell you what I told them other guys.
- Which is what?

535
00:54:40,193 --> 00:54:41,353
<i>I knew one of them.</i>

536
00:54:41,428 --> 00:54:43,589
<i>You're certain of that?</i>

537
00:54:43,930 --> 00:54:46,228
<i>He's a real crazy motherfucker, too.</i>

538
00:54:46,733 --> 00:54:47,961
<i>He was...</i>

539
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:50,002
<i>...sinister, you know?</i>

540
00:54:50,637 --> 00:54:53,299
<i>Some creepy, freaky, level 9 type shit.</i>

541
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:55,800
<i>Dark.</i>

542
00:54:56,009 --> 00:54:59,706
<i>Kind that's liable to shove a little snake</i>
<i>up the coochies of women.</i>

543
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:02,578
<i>Yeah, you better watch out for that one.</i>

544
00:55:02,649 --> 00:55:05,914
<i>Wherever he go, trouble bound to follow.</i>

545
00:55:08,121 --> 00:55:10,851
Oh, my God! Is he dead?

546
00:55:13,126 --> 00:55:15,185
Jumper cables might help.

547
00:55:15,595 --> 00:55:16,926
Did it hurt?

548
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:20,331
That's a funny question.

549
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,799
Well, did it?

550
00:55:22,002 --> 00:55:24,027
I think maybe the first one did.

551
00:55:24,704 --> 00:55:26,865
I could call the cops, you know.

552
00:55:29,542 --> 00:55:30,975
You could try.

553
00:55:42,956 --> 00:55:44,082
Allow me.

554
00:55:50,997 --> 00:55:52,862
Need some spot welding done?

555
00:55:52,932 --> 00:55:54,729
This guy you seem to know so well:

556
00:55:54,801 --> 00:55:58,897
- He's a real Elvis impersonator?
- No.

557
00:55:58,972 --> 00:56:02,100
- What does that mean?
- Remember when the King died in '77?

558
00:56:02,175 --> 00:56:04,109
Jesus, was it '77?

559
00:56:04,411 --> 00:56:07,505
He had a clause in his will
which stated that Lisa Marie...

560
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:10,447
...along with any illegitimate child
he may have fathered...

561
00:56:10,517 --> 00:56:13,418
...be entitled to his entire estate.
Naturally, I came forward.

562
00:56:15,976 --> 00:56:18,376
- Naturally.
- That's when I first met him.

563
00:56:18,511 --> 00:56:19,944
Did "him" have a name?

564
00:56:20,013 --> 00:56:21,810
Yeah! Murphy.

565
00:56:22,282 --> 00:56:23,544
Thomas Murphy.

566
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:28,378
Where are you headed?

567
00:56:30,824 --> 00:56:32,155
Can I come?

568
00:56:42,435 --> 00:56:43,732
Can I?

569
00:56:44,732 --> 00:56:54,732
