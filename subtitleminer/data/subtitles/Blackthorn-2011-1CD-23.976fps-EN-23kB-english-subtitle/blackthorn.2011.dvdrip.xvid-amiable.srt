1
00:01:28,907 --> 00:01:30,367
Dear Ryan,

2
00:01:30,826 --> 00:01:34,288
I reckon you're feeling lonely
now that your mother is gone.

3
00:01:34,454 --> 00:01:36,790
You're too young
for something like this.

4
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:42,379
She must've told you about me, and
I never stopped thinking about you.

5
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:45,591
Even though I've never seen you,
I bet my best memories

6
00:01:45,757 --> 00:01:48,719
I'd recognize you
in the blackest night.

7
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:52,806
These past years
have been hard on us all.

8
00:01:52,973 --> 00:01:55,225
Very few of us are still around.

9
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,272
The land where I live now
is a good one, quiet people,

10
00:02:00,564 --> 00:02:02,649
peaceful for the most part.

11
00:02:03,442 --> 00:02:05,235
But it's not home.

12
00:02:06,028 --> 00:02:08,614
That's why it's time for me
to come back...

13
00:02:10,198 --> 00:02:13,327
You'll burn this letter after you read
it, like your mother would've done,

14
00:02:13,493 --> 00:02:14,995
and wait for me.

15
00:02:16,204 --> 00:02:17,623
Much love,

16
00:02:18,498 --> 00:02:20,292
your uncle.

17
00:03:10,842 --> 00:03:13,136
I can't come tomorrow.

18
00:03:18,684 --> 00:03:22,229
We need you to pay us
for this week's work.

19
00:03:23,272 --> 00:03:26,483
And for the seeds too.
You never paid for them.

20
00:03:27,484 --> 00:03:30,445
You know where the money is.
Just take it.

21
00:03:30,696 --> 00:03:31,530
No.

22
00:03:31,822 --> 00:03:33,615
You're the boss.

23
00:03:33,782 --> 00:03:35,867
You have to give it to me.

24
00:03:36,034 --> 00:03:39,121
I can't take it.
That would be wrong.

25
00:03:40,163 --> 00:03:41,999
I'm not your wife.

26
00:03:44,501 --> 00:03:45,586
Sure.

27
00:03:49,172 --> 00:03:51,258
You're right, Yana.

28
00:03:53,594 --> 00:03:54,928
You're right.

29
00:04:01,727 --> 00:04:03,145
I have rain gear.

30
00:04:06,648 --> 00:04:09,026
Mr. James, you're going away,
aren't you?

31
00:04:09,818 --> 00:04:13,906
My mom says all gringos leave
once they have lots of money.

32
00:04:14,531 --> 00:04:17,826
You're a gringo,
but you don't have that much money.

33
00:04:19,328 --> 00:04:22,915
I'll have enough
after selling the horses.

34
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:26,919
Take care, Yana.

35
00:04:27,085 --> 00:04:29,796
I'll see you
when I'm back from Potosi.

36
00:04:30,005 --> 00:04:32,382
Then I'll leave for good.

37
00:05:03,538 --> 00:05:04,915
There ain't no grave

38
00:05:05,624 --> 00:05:07,960
can hold my body down.

39
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:13,590
There ain't no grave
can hold my body down.

40
00:05:16,176 --> 00:05:18,720
When I hear that trumpet sound

41
00:05:18,971 --> 00:05:21,431
I'm gonna rise
right out of the ground.

42
00:05:21,598 --> 00:05:22,724
Ain't no grave

43
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,936
can hold my body down.

44
00:05:28,146 --> 00:05:30,691
Well, I look way down the river

45
00:05:31,441 --> 00:05:33,527
And what do you think I see?

46
00:05:34,361 --> 00:05:36,780
I see a band of angels

47
00:05:37,322 --> 00:05:39,533
And they're coming after me.

48
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,617
There ain't no grave

49
00:05:41,868 --> 00:05:44,204
can hold my body down.

50
00:05:45,914 --> 00:05:49,918
There ain't no grave
can hold my body down.

51
00:05:52,421 --> 00:05:54,756
Well, look down yonder, Gabriel,

52
00:05:55,382 --> 00:05:58,343
Put your feet on the land
and see.

53
00:05:59,011 --> 00:06:01,888
But Gabriel,
don't you blow your horn

54
00:06:02,055 --> 00:06:03,640
Until you hear from me.

55
00:06:03,807 --> 00:06:05,726
There ain't no grave

56
00:06:05,976 --> 00:06:08,353
can hold my body down.

57
00:06:10,022 --> 00:06:14,026
There ain't no grave
can hold my body down.

58
00:06:25,787 --> 00:06:27,122
Take care of him.

59
00:07:15,963 --> 00:07:17,714
I'm withdrawing all mymoney.

60
00:07:18,465 --> 00:07:20,717
In dollars, please.

61
00:07:35,065 --> 00:07:36,483
Mr. Blackthorn,

62
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:38,694
have we done anything to upset you?

63
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:41,154
You know, there is just one thing.

64
00:07:41,697 --> 00:07:45,867
I can't remember ever being
so well received in a bank before.

65
00:07:46,285 --> 00:07:47,619
Good day.

66
00:08:21,361 --> 00:08:23,822
Your whisky, sir. American.

67
00:08:23,989 --> 00:08:25,115
Here. Thanks.

68
00:08:26,909 --> 00:08:28,994
Americans are creatures of habit.

69
00:08:29,161 --> 00:08:32,247
They have excellent Scotch here,
French cognac...

70
00:08:32,414 --> 00:08:36,084
But Mr. Blackthorn here likes
to stick with his old gringo whisky.

71
00:08:36,251 --> 00:08:38,795
Yeah, it just seems to haunt me,
you know.

72
00:08:40,088 --> 00:08:41,256
To a fine sale.

73
00:08:41,423 --> 00:08:42,090
Thank you.

74
00:08:42,674 --> 00:08:45,636
You have quite a talent
for breeding horses.

75
00:08:45,802 --> 00:08:48,305
Those horses will be the envy
of many men around here.

76
00:08:48,472 --> 00:08:51,058
But you'd think that here,
in Bolivia,

77
00:08:51,224 --> 00:08:55,395
with so many bloody Indians, it
would be simple to find good horses.

78
00:08:56,021 --> 00:08:58,482
Indians got nothing to do with it.

79
00:08:59,024 --> 00:09:02,527
The terrain's too rugged here
for good horses. Too high.

80
00:09:06,114 --> 00:09:10,077
I was wondering if maybe you all would
like to play a few rounds of cards.

81
00:09:11,078 --> 00:09:12,246
What you think?

82
00:09:12,412 --> 00:09:14,581
Yes, we're in.

83
00:09:14,748 --> 00:09:17,918
I miss a good card game
out on the ranch.

84
00:09:18,585 --> 00:09:21,755
Ain't nothing but a goddamned bunch
of Indians out there, you know.

85
00:09:21,922 --> 00:09:25,634
There's no civilized folk,
like yourselves.

86
00:11:06,818 --> 00:11:07,903
Easy.

87
00:11:09,488 --> 00:11:11,782
Don't leave me now, Cinco.

88
00:11:15,535 --> 00:11:16,787
Easy, buddy.

89
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:22,167
Easy, buddy.

90
00:11:22,334 --> 00:11:23,377
Don't move!

91
00:11:26,338 --> 00:11:27,798
Come here, horse.

92
00:11:28,215 --> 00:11:29,299
That's it.

93
00:11:52,781 --> 00:11:54,575
Goddamnit!

94
00:12:01,373 --> 00:12:03,875
- I'm out of bullets.
- Get up.

95
00:12:47,502 --> 00:12:48,503
Please.

96
00:12:50,422 --> 00:12:52,215
I'm freezing.

97
00:12:52,674 --> 00:12:53,634
Are you Chilean?

98
00:12:56,261 --> 00:12:57,471
Spanish.

99
00:12:58,096 --> 00:12:59,848
Conquistador!

100
00:13:00,557 --> 00:13:02,059
I just came here to work.

101
00:13:07,356 --> 00:13:08,857
Are you going to kill me?

102
00:13:09,024 --> 00:13:10,359
So you speak English.

103
00:13:13,612 --> 00:13:15,864
You got any idea
where in the world we are?

104
00:13:16,823 --> 00:13:18,784
We're in the middle of nowhere.

105
00:13:19,493 --> 00:13:22,120
My entire future
ran off with that horse.

106
00:13:22,663 --> 00:13:25,582
Everything I've got.
6.000 dollars to get me back home.

107
00:13:25,832 --> 00:13:27,668
Horse alone's worth 500.

108
00:13:27,834 --> 00:13:31,004
Now I've got your miserable life
on my hands...

109
00:13:31,171 --> 00:13:32,589
Ain't worth a nickel.

110
00:13:32,756 --> 00:13:34,383
I'm sorry.

111
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:37,219
I thought you were after me.

112
00:13:37,678 --> 00:13:40,847
Please, I just want
to live a little longer.

113
00:13:41,014 --> 00:13:41,932
You do, huh?

114
00:13:53,652 --> 00:13:55,195
Be my guest.

115
00:14:09,293 --> 00:14:10,544
Eat.

116
00:14:10,752 --> 00:14:13,297
Eat, you flea-ridden coward.

117
00:14:14,172 --> 00:14:16,258
It was just a little jump.

118
00:14:17,134 --> 00:14:18,594
"The best horses..."

119
00:14:19,469 --> 00:14:20,721
Filthy hag!

120
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,224
I'll run you all the way

121
00:14:24,391 --> 00:14:25,851
from here to El Paso!

122
00:14:34,526 --> 00:14:35,986
Oh, shit.

123
00:14:38,363 --> 00:14:39,156
Come on.

124
00:14:46,038 --> 00:14:46,705
Fuck!

125
00:14:52,711 --> 00:14:54,922
What the hell are you doing, Butch?

126
00:14:56,214 --> 00:14:59,468
- Not the best place to rest.
- It has a nice view.

127
00:15:14,524 --> 00:15:16,068
She's handy.

128
00:15:16,526 --> 00:15:17,653
You teach her?

129
00:15:18,153 --> 00:15:21,281
I don't think
anybody ever taught her anything.

130
00:15:21,448 --> 00:15:24,076
And it's about time
you learned her name.

131
00:15:28,288 --> 00:15:31,500
Kid, I think it's time for us to go.

132
00:15:31,667 --> 00:15:33,752
Don't worry, those were the last.

133
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:35,462
You're not listening.

134
00:15:36,088 --> 00:15:38,548
I mean go as in leave.

135
00:15:38,924 --> 00:15:41,426
Go to South America. Now.

136
00:15:47,641 --> 00:15:49,559
Butch wants to leave.

137
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:51,603
Go to South America.

138
00:15:52,604 --> 00:15:53,897
And he wants me to go with him.

139
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,900
Why you tellin' me?

140
00:15:57,067 --> 00:15:59,486
I think it might be a good idea.

141
00:16:00,737 --> 00:16:02,072
The three of us.

142
00:16:02,948 --> 00:16:04,241
That's all.

143
00:16:08,954 --> 00:16:10,956
It's a great idea.

144
00:16:53,332 --> 00:16:55,751
You're pushing your luck, son.

145
00:16:58,045 --> 00:16:59,254
Please.

146
00:17:00,672 --> 00:17:03,133
They've been following me for days.

147
00:17:04,468 --> 00:17:05,802
I need your help.

148
00:17:44,091 --> 00:17:46,718
Alright, now you can be on your way.

149
00:17:48,053 --> 00:17:52,099
Taypi is only about 15 miles away down
the tracks here, so you just follow it.

150
00:17:52,266 --> 00:17:55,227
Even if I make it,
they'll catch me.

151
00:17:55,394 --> 00:17:56,853
And they'll kill me.

152
00:17:57,479 --> 00:17:59,606
Well, good for them,
whoever they are.

153
00:18:00,107 --> 00:18:02,776
I'm not gonna repeat myself,
you son of a bitch!

154
00:18:02,943 --> 00:18:04,570
Get up and get down the tracks!

155
00:18:06,029 --> 00:18:09,992
Please. Have pity and help me.

156
00:18:12,995 --> 00:18:14,454
I can give you your money back.

157
00:18:16,456 --> 00:18:19,710
I have the money, but it's hidden.

158
00:18:19,876 --> 00:18:21,878
That's why they're after me.

159
00:18:25,215 --> 00:18:28,218
You'd better not be playing me,
you bastard!

160
00:18:32,889 --> 00:18:35,809
It's two or three days
on horseback from here.

161
00:18:36,226 --> 00:18:37,853
An abandoned mine.

162
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:40,022
I'm an engineer.

163
00:18:40,272 --> 00:18:43,609
I worked at the tin mines.
That's why I came over from Spain.

164
00:18:44,443 --> 00:18:47,446
When we get there, I'll give you
your money back. I promise.

165
00:18:49,114 --> 00:18:50,657
That's not good enough.

166
00:18:53,994 --> 00:18:55,954
I stole from the mine
I was working in,

167
00:18:56,288 --> 00:18:57,331
in Oruro.

168
00:18:57,497 --> 00:19:00,292
Those mines are well-guarded.
PatiÃ±o owns all that.

169
00:19:02,336 --> 00:19:03,420
Yeah.

170
00:19:04,755 --> 00:19:07,299
You stole from SimÃ³n PatiÃ±o?

171
00:19:09,009 --> 00:19:11,303
You're planting high cotton, boy.

172
00:19:13,055 --> 00:19:14,056
Can I have a drink?

173
00:19:20,479 --> 00:19:22,105
PatiÃ±o, huh?

174
00:19:25,734 --> 00:19:26,818
Yes.

175
00:19:27,152 --> 00:19:28,820
I robbed the Suyana Mine.

176
00:19:28,987 --> 00:19:30,239
PatiÃ±o... You know him?

177
00:19:30,405 --> 00:19:34,576
I know snakes, no matter
what hole they crawl out of.

178
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:43,293
- How many's following you?
- I don't know.

179
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,046
A dozen maybe, I'm not sure.

180
00:19:46,213 --> 00:19:47,756
How far back are they?

181
00:19:47,923 --> 00:19:49,675
A day or two.

182
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,303
Not anymore.

183
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:26,253
Who are you?

184
00:20:27,379 --> 00:20:29,256
My name is Eduardo.

185
00:20:29,965 --> 00:20:33,051
How much money did you steal, Eduardo?

186
00:20:33,343 --> 00:20:34,928
Not much. Just enough to...

187
00:20:35,095 --> 00:20:38,223
Nobody steals "not much" from
the richest man on the continent.

188
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:40,267
How much did you steal?

189
00:20:41,018 --> 00:20:43,312
10,000 pounds sterling.

190
00:20:43,937 --> 00:20:46,690
50,000 American dollars,
more or less.

191
00:20:46,857 --> 00:20:49,109
Well, that's 25,000 for me, then.

192
00:20:49,276 --> 00:20:50,986
But you said 6,000.

193
00:20:51,361 --> 00:20:52,446
Look,

194
00:20:52,613 --> 00:20:56,700
the only reason that you're alive
is that you might have some money.

195
00:20:56,992 --> 00:20:58,285
Now you owe me half!

196
00:20:58,452 --> 00:21:01,955
You owe me for every step I take without
a horse, every hour I go without water

197
00:21:02,331 --> 00:21:06,501
and you also owe me for not shooting
your sorry ass the first time I saw you!

198
00:21:06,752 --> 00:21:08,629
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.

199
00:21:08,795 --> 00:21:11,131
Now shut the fuck up
and just follow me.

200
00:21:29,066 --> 00:21:30,525
Fuck!

201
00:21:30,943 --> 00:21:33,362
Four days without a hat.

202
00:21:33,987 --> 00:21:36,740
This plateau sun is killing me.

203
00:21:38,325 --> 00:21:40,535
Meet me at the cantina.

204
00:21:45,874 --> 00:21:47,334
Keeper.

205
00:21:48,335 --> 00:21:49,795
We only have chicha.

206
00:21:49,962 --> 00:21:52,381
No. I want a pitcher of water.

207
00:21:52,547 --> 00:21:54,049
There's only chicha.

208
00:21:54,508 --> 00:21:55,759
Yeah...

209
00:22:01,473 --> 00:22:03,183
Two Bolivianos.

210
00:22:26,999 --> 00:22:28,709
Give me a drink.

211
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:32,087
And I want
two boxes of ammunition too.

212
00:22:32,254 --> 00:22:33,171
The same as yours.

213
00:22:33,338 --> 00:22:34,840
- I only have one.
- Okay.

214
00:22:36,049 --> 00:22:37,009
Thanks.

215
00:22:40,846 --> 00:22:43,432
I bought us a couple of mules.
That's all there is around here.

216
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:45,058
At least buy me a drink.

217
00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:47,227
You'll soon be rich.

218
00:22:48,979 --> 00:22:50,022
Nice pistol.

219
00:22:58,989 --> 00:23:00,449
I should thank you.

220
00:23:00,616 --> 00:23:02,075
I could have died.

221
00:23:02,534 --> 00:23:04,411
The plateau is like hell.

222
00:23:04,578 --> 00:23:05,829
You got no business
judging this land.

223
00:23:06,163 --> 00:23:08,624
And I'm not helping you either.

224
00:23:09,041 --> 00:23:11,376
I'm just trying to get back
what's mine.

225
00:23:12,336 --> 00:23:13,337
Okay.

226
00:23:15,672 --> 00:23:18,383
- So, what do we do now?
- Drink.

227
00:23:18,675 --> 00:23:21,803
- Okay. We agree on something.
- In silence.

228
00:23:29,811 --> 00:23:32,022
Will you get your ass up!

229
00:23:32,189 --> 00:23:35,067
I've got a couple mules here.
Let's get mounted.

230
00:23:39,112 --> 00:23:40,364
Come on!

231
00:23:42,157 --> 00:23:43,867
I'm ready when you are.

232
00:23:49,998 --> 00:23:51,083
Thank you.

233
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:53,919
If that money doesn't exist,
I'm going to kill you.

234
00:23:54,086 --> 00:23:56,797
And take my sweet time
doing it too.

235
00:24:09,393 --> 00:24:11,478
Shouldn't we move faster?

236
00:24:12,813 --> 00:24:16,942
Last time you moved faster you killed
your horse, don't you remember?

237
00:24:17,651 --> 00:24:19,486
I wouldn't say
I killed my horse.

238
00:24:19,653 --> 00:24:22,155
You wouldn't, huh?
What would you say?

239
00:24:22,739 --> 00:24:24,950
Hey, who do you think you are?

240
00:24:25,617 --> 00:24:28,453
We could get shot any minute now
and you're acting like...

241
00:24:28,996 --> 00:24:30,664
What? Come on.

242
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:34,126
Enough already!
Go to hell, man!

243
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:37,212
Go to fucking hell!

244
00:25:18,378 --> 00:25:20,631
The last miner left 8 years ago.

245
00:25:20,797 --> 00:25:24,009
There were 10,000 people
living here at one point.

246
00:25:24,426 --> 00:25:27,930
PatiÃ±o was convinced he could
bleed a little more out of it.

247
00:25:28,263 --> 00:25:30,057
So, when I came over from Spain,

248
00:25:30,224 --> 00:25:34,394
he sent me here and had me
searching six months. For nothing.

249
00:25:35,896 --> 00:25:38,982
I know this mine
like I dug it myself.

250
00:25:39,274 --> 00:25:40,609
You'd better.

251
00:25:50,702 --> 00:25:53,622
Are you going to kill me
when you get the money?

252
00:25:54,539 --> 00:25:56,792
Come on, let's get this over with.

253
00:25:58,752 --> 00:25:59,836
Wait.

254
00:26:03,966 --> 00:26:06,760
I have no reason to trust you either.

255
00:26:07,261 --> 00:26:09,930
There's a lot of money at stake.

256
00:26:10,389 --> 00:26:12,099
Where did you get that antique?

257
00:26:12,266 --> 00:26:14,184
I'm not so bad with Bolivian women.

258
00:26:16,436 --> 00:26:18,522
So, are you going to shoot me now?

259
00:26:21,108 --> 00:26:23,360
No, I don't want to.

260
00:26:24,486 --> 00:26:28,073
We've been together for days
and I don't even know your name.

261
00:26:28,865 --> 00:26:30,784
I can't trust
someone with no name.

262
00:26:30,951 --> 00:26:32,869
Well, you ought to trust me.

263
00:26:34,329 --> 00:26:37,374
I saved your life
a couple of times, didn't I?

264
00:26:38,083 --> 00:26:40,419
Besides, I'm not your problem.

265
00:26:40,794 --> 00:26:42,212
That's your problem over there.

266
00:26:42,921 --> 00:26:43,755
What?

267
00:26:44,131 --> 00:26:45,465
That dust.

268
00:26:50,304 --> 00:26:53,432
Those could be several
of your friends at full gallop.

269
00:26:56,894 --> 00:26:58,270
You're empty, son.

270
00:27:00,355 --> 00:27:01,523
You're a son of a bitch.

271
00:27:03,317 --> 00:27:04,484
Yeah.

272
00:27:05,611 --> 00:27:09,323
You should hear
what they called me back in Wyoming.

273
00:27:28,592 --> 00:27:30,052
We're close.

274
00:27:30,469 --> 00:27:33,472
Next gallery to the left.
Watch your head.

275
00:27:35,265 --> 00:27:37,976
When did you find out
I had the other revolver?

276
00:27:38,143 --> 00:27:40,145
About ten minutes ago.

277
00:27:49,196 --> 00:27:51,031
Giddy up, son! Bring the light!

278
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,575
I'm not a goddamn mole!

279
00:28:06,588 --> 00:28:08,215
It's all here.

280
00:28:09,216 --> 00:28:10,550
I'm willing to split it now.

281
00:28:10,717 --> 00:28:12,886
- What's to split?
- Sorry?

282
00:28:13,053 --> 00:28:15,347
There's nothing to split.
It's useless in here.

283
00:28:15,514 --> 00:28:17,724
I mean, if you make it out of here
alive, it might be worth something.

284
00:28:17,891 --> 00:28:21,270
But right now all you got
is your stupid gun and your lamp.

285
00:28:22,396 --> 00:28:23,897
How the hell do we get out of here?

286
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:26,817
- Just follow me.
- Yeah, that's what I've been doing.

287
00:28:26,984 --> 00:28:27,818
Come on!

288
00:28:27,985 --> 00:28:30,737
The mine has lots of ways
out to the mountain.

289
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:44,334
Now what, Mr. Engineer?

290
00:28:46,169 --> 00:28:48,964
Shoot the lights!
Leave them blind!

291
00:28:49,798 --> 00:28:52,092
Okay, here's your gun back.

292
00:28:55,429 --> 00:28:56,847
- Ready?
- Ready.

293
00:29:13,447 --> 00:29:15,490
Goddamned Spaniard!

294
00:29:15,782 --> 00:29:17,117
You call this a way out?

295
00:29:17,284 --> 00:29:20,162
I could find my way out of Hell
easier than this.

296
00:29:20,913 --> 00:29:22,456
Thanks to this way out,

297
00:29:22,623 --> 00:29:26,501
it'll be impossible for them
to pick up our trail again, old man.

298
00:29:29,546 --> 00:29:31,465
Where the hell are we?

299
00:29:45,103 --> 00:29:46,897
- We're safe.
- Safe?

300
00:29:47,064 --> 00:29:50,150
You stole 50,000 dollars.
You ain't gonna be safe for long.

301
00:29:50,317 --> 00:29:52,236
Well, I guess
I'll have to live with that.

302
00:29:52,778 --> 00:29:54,196
But I feel good.

303
00:29:54,363 --> 00:29:56,156
I feel better than ever.

304
00:30:06,875 --> 00:30:09,127
My name's James Blackthorn.

305
00:30:09,294 --> 00:30:11,171
Utah, United States.

306
00:30:11,338 --> 00:30:14,633
Eduardo Apodaca.
From Madrid, Spain.

307
00:30:17,052 --> 00:30:20,889
Rosario is not too far from here.
We can buy some cheap horses over there.

308
00:30:21,139 --> 00:30:23,559
I got me a little ranch
somewhere around here.

309
00:30:23,725 --> 00:30:25,644
We can get some rest up there.

310
00:30:28,939 --> 00:30:31,233
Sometimes it's beautiful...

311
00:30:31,858 --> 00:30:33,610
It is that.

312
00:30:44,371 --> 00:30:47,749
You kept me waiting for an hour
for that?

313
00:30:47,916 --> 00:30:48,834
You in a hurry?

314
00:30:49,376 --> 00:30:52,212
Sometimes, this is like having
a little friend along with you.

315
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:56,091
- Maybe even better.
- Yeah.

316
00:30:57,467 --> 00:31:01,638
Well, my name it is Sam Hall,
Sam Hall

317
00:31:03,932 --> 00:31:07,644
My name it is Sam Hall,
Sam Hall

318
00:31:08,729 --> 00:31:11,356
My name it is Sam Hall

319
00:31:11,565 --> 00:31:14,026
and I hate you, one and all

320
00:31:14,192 --> 00:31:16,361
And I hate you, one and all

321
00:31:16,528 --> 00:31:18,780
Damn your eyes!

322
00:31:19,656 --> 00:31:23,660
To the gallows I must go,
I must go

323
00:31:24,786 --> 00:31:28,957
To the gallows I must go,
I must go

324
00:31:30,667 --> 00:31:32,920
To the gallows I must go,

325
00:31:33,086 --> 00:31:35,714
while you critters down below

326
00:31:35,881 --> 00:31:38,467
Yell out: "Sam, I told you so"

327
00:31:38,634 --> 00:31:41,094
Well, damn your eyes!

328
00:31:41,887 --> 00:31:46,016
Now the preacher he did come,
he did come

329
00:31:47,142 --> 00:31:50,145
Yes, the preacher he did come,
he did come

330
00:31:52,147 --> 00:31:54,441
The preacher he did come

331
00:31:54,608 --> 00:31:56,735
and he preached till Kingdom come

332
00:31:56,902 --> 00:32:01,114
Well, you can kiss my bloody bum
Damn his eyes!

333
00:32:02,574 --> 00:32:06,203
My name is Samu-el,
Samu-el

334
00:32:07,955 --> 00:32:11,208
My name is Samu-el,
Samu-el

335
00:32:13,293 --> 00:32:15,629
My name is Samu-el,

336
00:32:15,796 --> 00:32:18,715
I'll see you all in Hell

337
00:32:18,882 --> 00:32:21,260
An' I'll see you all in Hell

338
00:32:21,426 --> 00:32:23,345
Damn your eyes...

339
00:32:35,607 --> 00:32:38,694
You're rich, right?
I mean, your family.

340
00:32:39,528 --> 00:32:42,656
Well, I guess it depends
on whom you compare me to.

341
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,950
Poor people.

342
00:32:46,743 --> 00:32:50,455
In that case, I reckon
you could say I grew up comfortably.

343
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:54,543
Never rode with a gentleman before.

344
00:32:56,086 --> 00:32:58,171
Never thought I would.

345
00:33:00,841 --> 00:33:03,719
Friendship is the most valuable
thing a man can have.

346
00:33:05,053 --> 00:33:08,932
It's worth more than money,
land, horses or cattle.

347
00:33:10,475 --> 00:33:14,396
It might be the only thing you
never forget. And it lasts forever.

348
00:33:15,606 --> 00:33:18,859
Your father believed that.
Your mother did too.

349
00:33:35,918 --> 00:33:38,295
You just have to hold
the cards steady.

350
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:44,384
Rattlesnake bites are your thing,
not mosquitoes.

351
00:33:47,054 --> 00:33:50,057
Etta bought these suits
so we could wear them, Butch.

352
00:33:50,224 --> 00:33:53,101
Now get up off your sorry ass
and come downstairs with us.

353
00:33:53,268 --> 00:33:56,813
Argentinians know plenty,
but not about poker.

354
00:33:57,147 --> 00:33:59,441
Not about poker, my friend.

355
00:34:00,317 --> 00:34:01,902
You two are...

356
00:34:03,737 --> 00:34:04,905
you're quite a sight.

357
00:34:06,156 --> 00:34:08,784
All the more reason
for you to join us.

358
00:34:09,368 --> 00:34:10,827
Go on, get out of here, damn it.

359
00:34:10,994 --> 00:34:12,454
I need some sleep.

360
00:34:12,913 --> 00:34:14,581
Bring me up someting to drink.

361
00:34:14,748 --> 00:34:16,208
And watch yourselves.

362
00:34:16,375 --> 00:34:17,501
Come on, Butch...

363
00:34:17,668 --> 00:34:20,712
Ain't nobody
been chasing us for a long time.

364
00:34:23,423 --> 00:34:27,594
"Ain't nobody
been chasing us for a long time."

365
00:34:27,761 --> 00:34:30,013
- Damn your eyes.
- Shut up.

366
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:34,184
We'd have been long gone three days ago
if it hadn't been for your mosquito bite.

367
00:34:35,269 --> 00:34:37,604
I can't even pronounce
the name of this damn place.

368
00:34:37,771 --> 00:34:39,773
San Juan.

369
00:34:40,649 --> 00:34:42,109
Anyways...

370
00:34:42,734 --> 00:34:45,153
And why the hell
haven't they put cuffs on us?

371
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:48,532
They probably
don't have any handcuffs.

372
00:34:49,992 --> 00:34:51,785
This is humiliating.

373
00:34:51,952 --> 00:34:53,787
You don't say.

374
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:02,004
Right, here we go.

375
00:35:03,505 --> 00:35:04,673
Sir,

376
00:35:05,507 --> 00:35:08,427
there's your gringo bandits.
One's sick.

377
00:35:12,764 --> 00:35:15,517
Sorry to hear
you've not been too well.

378
00:35:15,684 --> 00:35:18,770
It's just an insect bite,
Mr. MacKinley. Nothing serious.

379
00:35:18,937 --> 00:35:20,314
Yes, these places...

380
00:35:20,898 --> 00:35:25,027
You never know
what'll be the next damn insect

381
00:35:25,193 --> 00:35:27,487
or vermin
to rip a piece off of you.

382
00:35:29,448 --> 00:35:30,699
Look.

383
00:35:31,491 --> 00:35:34,453
Snake bite,
two years ago at Chaco.

384
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:37,039
There's a saying around here:
"Dos pasitos".

385
00:35:37,331 --> 00:35:38,874
"Two steps".

386
00:35:39,041 --> 00:35:41,335
They say that by the third step
you're dead.

387
00:35:44,087 --> 00:35:45,547
I got lucky.

388
00:35:47,549 --> 00:35:48,884
This one

389
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:53,555
was last winter in Atacama.

390
00:35:53,722 --> 00:35:57,517
A scorpion the size of a clock.
I could hardly walk for two months.

391
00:35:57,935 --> 00:35:59,645
Then I was left with this lump.

392
00:36:01,897 --> 00:36:05,859
But I'm sure I'm not telling you
a damn thing you don't know yourselves.

393
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,654
We've all been in the same places.

394
00:36:09,154 --> 00:36:11,615
It was about time
we met face to face.

395
00:36:13,367 --> 00:36:15,535
- Finally.
- Go to hell, MacKinley.

396
00:36:16,161 --> 00:36:17,746
Let's get it over with.

397
00:36:17,913 --> 00:36:19,706
I can't wait.

398
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:23,168
Open. It's the sheriff.

399
00:36:28,382 --> 00:36:29,633
Mr. Albion MacKinley,

400
00:36:30,425 --> 00:36:33,011
may I introduce Miss Etta Place.

401
00:36:36,557 --> 00:36:38,559
Well, well, MacKinley.

402
00:36:39,643 --> 00:36:41,395
You're a gentleman.

403
00:36:41,937 --> 00:36:44,273
I thought all Pinkerton men

404
00:36:44,439 --> 00:36:46,358
were bloodthirsty thugs

405
00:36:46,817 --> 00:36:48,860
sold to the highest bidder.

406
00:36:49,653 --> 00:36:51,738
- You gonna run in your underwear?
- What?

407
00:37:10,465 --> 00:37:13,886
I have a gift for you.

408
00:37:20,142 --> 00:37:22,728
It's a gringo machine.

409
00:37:22,895 --> 00:37:24,813
Silver is best used
for other things.

410
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,523
I don't understand that time.

411
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:28,483
Yeah, me neither.

412
00:37:29,776 --> 00:37:31,570
Don't do that! It's mine!

413
00:37:36,742 --> 00:37:38,118
Keep it.

414
00:37:38,744 --> 00:37:40,954
It's something
to remember me by.

415
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:42,831
Cheers.

416
00:37:43,832 --> 00:37:44,833
Cheers.

417
00:37:45,709 --> 00:37:47,294
To the two of you.

418
00:37:50,923 --> 00:37:53,383
I'm going to go. It's dark out.

419
00:37:55,761 --> 00:37:57,137
Yana,

420
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:02,142
you know I'm going back
to my country tomorrow.

421
00:38:02,434 --> 00:38:03,936
For good.

422
00:38:04,102 --> 00:38:06,563
Spend the night here, please.

423
00:38:08,482 --> 00:38:09,441
I can't.

424
00:38:10,192 --> 00:38:13,737
My family's waiting for me.
It's dark out.

425
00:38:15,781 --> 00:38:16,907
Sure.

426
00:38:24,623 --> 00:38:26,833
I have rain gear.

427
00:38:29,586 --> 00:38:31,380
- No?
- No.

428
00:38:42,391 --> 00:38:45,519
Goodbye, Mr. James.
Take care of yourself.

429
00:39:10,794 --> 00:39:12,588
What about all this?

430
00:39:14,506 --> 00:39:15,757
This?

431
00:39:15,966 --> 00:39:17,593
It's just a place.

432
00:39:19,386 --> 00:39:22,264
Yana and her family'll make
good use of it.

433
00:39:22,431 --> 00:39:24,391
They live off the land.

434
00:39:26,768 --> 00:39:27,936
More?

435
00:39:37,863 --> 00:39:41,408
About two months ago
I got a letter from San Francisco.

436
00:39:41,575 --> 00:39:45,537
A woman I'd loved very much

437
00:39:45,829 --> 00:39:48,290
died of tuberculosis.

438
00:39:49,249 --> 00:39:50,918
Left an only kid,

439
00:39:51,084 --> 00:39:53,712
a son I've never seen before.

440
00:39:57,424 --> 00:39:59,051
So I figured

441
00:40:03,639 --> 00:40:07,267
now might be a good time
to go back and pay him a visit.

442
00:40:07,434 --> 00:40:09,561
Keep each other company.

443
00:40:11,396 --> 00:40:15,359
Sometimes I think there's only
two moments in a man's life.

444
00:40:15,734 --> 00:40:19,404
One's when he leaves home.
The other one's when he returns.

445
00:40:19,947 --> 00:40:22,616
Everything else
is just in the middle.

446
00:40:24,243 --> 00:40:28,163
Well, it looks like we'll be headed
in different directions, won't we?

447
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:08,495
Mr. James?

448
00:41:10,789 --> 00:41:11,707
Yana?

449
00:41:52,289 --> 00:41:53,081
Good morning.

450
00:41:55,334 --> 00:41:56,710
What do you want?

451
00:41:57,210 --> 00:41:59,922
We found your horse
in the desert four days ago.

452
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:03,759
Where is he?

453
00:42:04,051 --> 00:42:05,052
He's dead.

454
00:42:05,219 --> 00:42:07,888
But we have your blankets
and your money.

455
00:42:10,724 --> 00:42:12,059
So?

456
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:15,437
Where's your friend
the Spaniard?

457
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:22,986
What friend?

458
00:42:23,153 --> 00:42:24,446
Fucking gringo!

459
00:45:34,553 --> 00:45:35,846
That's enough.

460
00:45:43,145 --> 00:45:45,939
All right,
let's get this over with. Go.

461
00:45:52,529 --> 00:45:53,447
Shit!

462
00:46:02,247 --> 00:46:04,583
Here, you might need to use this.

463
00:46:33,487 --> 00:46:35,155
Thanks for that.

464
00:46:45,290 --> 00:46:47,000
They're smart.

465
00:46:47,167 --> 00:46:49,628
Someone must have told them
we were together,

466
00:46:49,795 --> 00:46:53,090
so they sent two women
so we wouldn't suspect.

467
00:46:53,590 --> 00:46:57,511
When they realize they are not
coming back, they will come after us.

468
00:47:56,194 --> 00:47:57,988
He's waiting outside?

469
00:47:58,614 --> 00:47:59,698
Yeah.

470
00:48:01,450 --> 00:48:03,452
It's a long trip.

471
00:48:04,786 --> 00:48:06,580
If I made it here,
I can make it back.

472
00:48:10,375 --> 00:48:12,002
We all can.

473
00:48:15,297 --> 00:48:18,717
He'll forgive you.
You know what he's like.

474
00:48:18,967 --> 00:48:20,427
Nothing to forgive, Butch.

475
00:48:20,761 --> 00:48:22,554
I'm not walking out on you.

476
00:48:23,472 --> 00:48:25,891
I'm just defending what's ours.

477
00:48:40,197 --> 00:48:41,740
Come with me.

478
00:48:42,783 --> 00:48:45,285
Come on.
You're not young anymore.

479
00:48:48,038 --> 00:48:50,791
Truth be told, we're still losing.

480
00:48:51,959 --> 00:48:54,336
You'd never have any peace.

481
00:49:03,929 --> 00:49:05,389
I love you both.

482
00:49:08,684 --> 00:49:09,726
Tell him.

483
00:49:14,856 --> 00:49:15,482
Wait!

484
00:49:15,774 --> 00:49:17,359
What will you name it?

485
00:49:18,527 --> 00:49:19,528
Ryan.

486
00:49:41,842 --> 00:49:43,343
She'll come back.

487
00:49:43,802 --> 00:49:45,387
I know it.

488
00:49:46,263 --> 00:49:47,764
Of course.

489
00:49:49,099 --> 00:49:51,560
Who could stay away
from all this?

490
00:49:55,397 --> 00:49:58,483
If the world
from you withhold

491
00:49:58,692 --> 00:50:01,820
of its silver and its gold,

492
00:50:02,279 --> 00:50:06,408
And you have to get along
with meager fare,

493
00:50:07,951 --> 00:50:10,871
Just remember, in His Word,

494
00:50:11,038 --> 00:50:13,916
how He feeds the little bird;

495
00:50:14,082 --> 00:50:18,253
Take your burden to the Lord
and leave it there.

496
00:50:20,088 --> 00:50:21,840
Leave it there,

497
00:50:22,925 --> 00:50:24,968
oh, leave it there.

498
00:50:26,345 --> 00:50:29,223
Take your burden to the Lord

499
00:50:29,765 --> 00:50:31,308
and leave it there.

500
00:50:34,228 --> 00:50:36,563
The Uyuni Salt Flats.

501
00:50:39,066 --> 00:50:40,943
There's nothing more beautiful.

502
00:50:42,152 --> 00:50:43,946
It's like a sweet death.

503
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:48,450
It's gonna be tough, but it's
the only way over those mountains.

504
00:50:49,034 --> 00:50:53,163
On the other side, I can catch me
a boat back home from Chile or Peru.

505
00:51:01,213 --> 00:51:02,839
Come on over here, son.

506
00:51:05,175 --> 00:51:06,343
Get down.

507
00:51:11,306 --> 00:51:12,891
Drop your pants.

508
00:51:13,433 --> 00:51:14,601
Are you nuts?

509
00:51:14,768 --> 00:51:17,729
If we don't heal
those saddle wounds, you can't ride.

510
00:51:17,896 --> 00:51:19,356
You're gonna die out here.

511
00:51:19,773 --> 00:51:21,441
Come on, turn around.

512
00:51:26,530 --> 00:51:27,823
You ready?

513
00:51:28,574 --> 00:51:31,034
This might sting a little bit.

514
00:51:39,585 --> 00:51:40,919
There you go.

515
00:51:41,336 --> 00:51:42,337
Fuck!

516
00:51:45,924 --> 00:51:49,177
Your ass is softer
than a bookkeeper's.

517
00:51:51,013 --> 00:51:52,180
Are you okay?

518
00:51:53,307 --> 00:51:54,308
Yeah.

519
00:51:58,312 --> 00:52:01,398
It's been a long time
since I've been out here.

520
00:52:03,901 --> 00:52:05,777
I like these places.

521
00:52:06,111 --> 00:52:07,988
They can't be used.

522
00:52:08,196 --> 00:52:09,364
They got no owners.

523
00:52:09,531 --> 00:52:10,741
But they will.

524
00:52:10,949 --> 00:52:12,284
That's how life works.

525
00:52:12,451 --> 00:52:15,203
I hope I'm dead when that day comes.

526
00:52:17,956 --> 00:52:19,124
James.

527
00:52:20,918 --> 00:52:22,336
I wanted to say...

528
00:52:22,502 --> 00:52:25,172
All that happened about Yana and...

529
00:52:26,757 --> 00:52:29,468
I knew the risks
as well as you, going in.

530
00:52:30,552 --> 00:52:32,638
There's nothing to say.

531
00:52:35,974 --> 00:52:37,893
Maybe we should
shelter up down there.

532
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:39,603
It's gonna freeze tonight.

533
00:52:41,772 --> 00:52:45,025
These horses aren't gonna
last long at this altitude.

534
00:52:45,234 --> 00:52:46,860
No air, no water...

535
00:52:49,655 --> 00:52:51,740
What did you do in your country?

536
00:52:55,911 --> 00:52:58,372
I think you got
a pretty good idea, don't you?

537
00:53:03,961 --> 00:53:08,048
We covered more than six states,
back in the day.

538
00:53:11,343 --> 00:53:13,929
Some of 'em bigger
than this whole country.

539
00:53:15,764 --> 00:53:18,058
Of course things
were different back then.

540
00:53:18,225 --> 00:53:20,269
There was room for everybody.

541
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:27,109
Then the railroad came in,
and big ranchers.

542
00:53:27,442 --> 00:53:29,194
Everything changed.

543
00:53:31,405 --> 00:53:33,949
It turned into a kind of a war.

544
00:53:35,158 --> 00:53:37,786
We ended up
on the losing end of the stick.

545
00:53:38,412 --> 00:53:39,705
And why Bolivia?

546
00:53:39,871 --> 00:53:43,959
It was far, far away.

547
00:53:45,335 --> 00:53:47,588
- Far away from what?
- Everything.

548
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:49,798
See, one day...

549
00:53:52,384 --> 00:53:54,136
I woke up and...

550
00:53:56,013 --> 00:53:57,222
found myself alone.

551
00:53:57,848 --> 00:54:01,852
Seemed like everybody I knew
was either dead or in jail.

552
00:54:02,352 --> 00:54:05,022
They thought I was dead too.
So I just...

553
00:54:05,188 --> 00:54:07,566
did what any good dead person
would do.

554
00:54:07,774 --> 00:54:09,651
I went off
and raised me some horses.

555
00:54:11,278 --> 00:54:15,032
Twenty years!
That's a big change.

556
00:54:15,866 --> 00:54:17,534
Quiet times.

557
00:54:19,244 --> 00:54:23,415
I am too long in the tooth
to go off and be what I used to be,

558
00:54:23,582 --> 00:54:26,335
just an ordinary old bandit.

559
00:54:27,878 --> 00:54:30,172
You should have become
a rancher, too.

560
00:54:30,339 --> 00:54:33,592
You'd be rich now,
instead of being here with me.

561
00:54:34,676 --> 00:54:35,427
Rich?

562
00:54:37,221 --> 00:54:39,181
I've been my own man.

563
00:54:39,890 --> 00:54:41,600
Ain't nothing richer than that.

564
00:54:43,477 --> 00:54:45,437
Had some good friends, too.

565
00:54:54,112 --> 00:54:55,572
They don't sleep.

566
00:54:57,991 --> 00:55:01,453
Sure you killed a few
not so friendly in those days, huh?

567
00:55:01,912 --> 00:55:04,498
Me? I've never had to kill nobody.

568
00:55:04,957 --> 00:55:06,458
So far.

569
00:55:06,792 --> 00:55:08,627
Come on,
let's get these horses saddled up.

570
00:55:34,027 --> 00:55:36,363
They must be very well paid.

571
00:55:36,655 --> 00:55:39,700
I've never seen anybody
take so much punishment.

572
00:55:40,450 --> 00:55:42,744
We should never have tried
to cross the salt flats.

573
00:55:42,911 --> 00:55:44,037
It's the only way.

574
00:55:44,204 --> 00:55:47,040
Otherwise they'd have surrounded us
and we wouldn't even see it coming.

575
00:55:47,207 --> 00:55:50,377
This way,
all they can do is track us

576
00:55:50,752 --> 00:55:53,380
and see whose horses die first.

577
00:56:29,458 --> 00:56:31,752
Get the rifle and water.
Come on!

578
00:56:32,002 --> 00:56:33,086
Mount up!

579
00:56:40,469 --> 00:56:42,304
Come on! Let's go!

580
00:57:25,889 --> 00:57:27,432
Three men on horseback.

581
00:57:28,350 --> 00:57:30,644
We still have a few minutes.

582
00:57:32,854 --> 00:57:35,649
- We stand a chance here, right?
- I don't know.

583
00:57:39,611 --> 00:57:40,946
James.

584
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:42,906
I'm glad I'm with you.

585
00:57:43,073 --> 00:57:47,202
You know, before I met you,
damn the day,

586
00:57:47,578 --> 00:57:51,290
I thought if I was gonna die of old age,
I might as well go back home to do it.

587
00:57:51,456 --> 00:57:52,416
But, Hell,

588
00:57:53,083 --> 00:57:55,878
this seems like as good a day
as any to die.

589
00:57:56,044 --> 00:57:58,881
- We're not gonna die, old man.
- Of course not, son.

590
00:57:59,047 --> 00:58:00,674
Nobody ever does.

591
00:58:00,966 --> 00:58:02,175
Just in case,

592
00:58:02,342 --> 00:58:05,345
we ought to bury this money before
PatiÃ±o gets his hands on it again.

593
00:58:06,305 --> 00:58:08,599
It is too late.
They're too close.

594
00:58:15,105 --> 00:58:17,941
They're gonna surround us.
They know we're here.

595
00:58:29,077 --> 00:58:30,871
Oh my God.

596
00:58:37,961 --> 00:58:39,671
What are we gonna do?

597
00:59:04,821 --> 00:59:06,490
All right, look.

598
00:59:07,032 --> 00:59:09,409
You take the good horse,
and the money.

599
00:59:09,576 --> 00:59:12,287
Head South-East,
you follow that mountain range.

600
00:59:12,537 --> 00:59:14,331
If you're lucky,
you'll wind up in Tupiza.

601
00:59:14,498 --> 00:59:15,123
What?

602
00:59:15,290 --> 00:59:17,584
I'm gonna take the other horse
and head South-West.

603
00:59:17,751 --> 00:59:20,212
Their horses have to be wiped out
by now. I'll meet you down there.

604
00:59:20,379 --> 00:59:22,422
- But...
- It's the only way to do it, splitting up.

605
00:59:22,589 --> 00:59:25,592
- They'll kill us!
- This desert'll kill you before they do.

606
00:59:27,219 --> 00:59:28,845
I don't want to be by myself.

607
00:59:29,012 --> 00:59:31,431
Your horse'll make it,
don't worry.

608
00:59:34,601 --> 00:59:37,521
Just remember: Southeast.

609
00:59:37,688 --> 00:59:40,732
And don't buy one of those goddam
mansions full of flowers, all right?

610
00:59:40,899 --> 00:59:42,568
You spend that money quick.

611
00:59:42,734 --> 00:59:43,652
But...

612
00:59:45,654 --> 00:59:46,989
Shit!

613
01:01:03,315 --> 01:01:04,358
Don't move.

614
01:01:07,152 --> 01:01:08,695
Don't move!

615
01:01:19,831 --> 01:01:21,875
Drop the gun, you son of a bitch.

616
01:03:06,855 --> 01:03:09,441
How many times did we go out

617
01:03:10,108 --> 01:03:12,694
hunting together, myfriend?

618
01:03:16,406 --> 01:03:17,449
Fucking Spaniard!

619
01:05:47,474 --> 01:05:48,934
Get on, Sundance.

620
01:05:54,147 --> 01:05:55,399
Ain't nobody following us.

621
01:05:56,316 --> 01:05:58,610
They think we're back
at the corral.

622
01:05:59,444 --> 01:06:01,154
The bullet's still inside.

623
01:06:03,365 --> 01:06:05,951
You think the Chilean
and the Yankee will make it?

624
01:06:06,118 --> 01:06:09,246
Or when they find their bodies,
they'll think they're us.

625
01:06:09,413 --> 01:06:10,539
Then, we're free.

626
01:06:11,957 --> 01:06:13,584
I like being dead.

627
01:06:13,750 --> 01:06:15,419
Hell, if I had only known sooner...

628
01:06:16,253 --> 01:06:17,838
Give me your hand, Sundance.

629
01:06:19,214 --> 01:06:22,467
I should've gone
with Etta and the boy.

630
01:06:23,677 --> 01:06:25,012
A son.

631
01:06:25,304 --> 01:06:29,266
That's more than a lot of people have
to say for themselves, don't you think?

632
01:06:31,727 --> 01:06:34,104
What makes you think
he's yours, you desert dog?

633
01:06:34,271 --> 01:06:35,772
It doesn't matter.

634
01:06:36,732 --> 01:06:38,066
He'll still be my son.

635
01:06:39,943 --> 01:06:41,403
Let's head for the mountains, Butch.

636
01:06:41,820 --> 01:06:44,364
We'll cross those mountains
and go home.

637
01:06:46,074 --> 01:06:48,076
Damn Bolivian Army.

638
01:06:48,702 --> 01:06:51,121
Worst aim I've ever seen.

639
01:07:22,444 --> 01:07:24,655
Goddamn little doctor!

640
01:07:25,155 --> 01:07:27,324
I told you I'll pay you.

641
01:07:27,491 --> 01:07:29,159
I was just fine in the bar!

642
01:07:29,326 --> 01:07:31,411
That's not why I called for you.

643
01:07:31,578 --> 01:07:33,956
Mr. Mackinley,
come in, come in.

644
01:07:38,919 --> 01:07:41,630
When you worked
for the Pinkertons,

645
01:07:41,797 --> 01:07:45,509
you came here to Bolivia
chasing bandits, right?

646
01:07:45,884 --> 01:07:47,636
Well, that's excellent!

647
01:07:47,886 --> 01:07:49,846
I found my memory!

648
01:07:50,013 --> 01:07:54,017
And it turns out it's
a goddamn Bolivian quack.

649
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:58,313
If I remember right,
you always said

650
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:02,526
the men they killed in San Vicente
weren't your bandits.

651
01:08:03,485 --> 01:08:06,947
Well, you might have been right.

652
01:08:08,907 --> 01:08:10,075
But...

653
01:08:10,325 --> 01:08:12,744
You're not too drunk, are you?

654
01:08:12,911 --> 01:08:14,621
Fuck off.

655
01:08:15,038 --> 01:08:16,331
Well,

656
01:08:16,623 --> 01:08:20,419
now we're going to see
if you were right or not.

657
01:08:21,670 --> 01:08:22,754
Look.

658
01:08:44,568 --> 01:08:46,236
Sweet Jesus.

659
01:08:49,197 --> 01:08:51,950
Sweet suffering Jesus, it's him.

660
01:08:52,117 --> 01:08:53,911
It's him, isn't it?

661
01:08:54,244 --> 01:08:55,287
Yes.

662
01:08:56,205 --> 01:08:58,373
Robert Leroy Parker.

663
01:08:59,374 --> 01:09:00,584
Butch Cassidy.

664
01:09:00,751 --> 01:09:03,879
All of them will apologize to me.

665
01:09:05,255 --> 01:09:07,132
All those bastards.

666
01:09:08,008 --> 01:09:09,301
What's he got?

667
01:09:09,843 --> 01:09:11,386
A bullet wound,

668
01:09:11,553 --> 01:09:14,681
dehydration and fatigue.

669
01:09:15,724 --> 01:09:17,517
He just needs to rest.

670
01:09:20,854 --> 01:09:22,731
Rest...

671
01:10:03,146 --> 01:10:05,023
Here we are.

672
01:10:12,531 --> 01:10:14,157
You and me.

673
01:10:30,215 --> 01:10:31,508
Water!

674
01:10:41,393 --> 01:10:43,729
You're in poor shape.

675
01:10:44,104 --> 01:10:47,357
Even worse than the last time
we saw each other.

676
01:10:49,943 --> 01:10:52,738
What the fuck are you doing
in Bolivia?

677
01:10:53,572 --> 01:10:55,866
Haven't you got
anything better to do?

678
01:10:56,033 --> 01:10:57,409
And where is my pistol?

679
01:11:02,497 --> 01:11:04,208
What should I call you?

680
01:11:05,918 --> 01:11:09,213
I've been going under Blackthorn.
Does it matter?

681
01:11:09,379 --> 01:11:10,547
It matters.

682
01:11:11,048 --> 01:11:12,925
Of course it does.

683
01:11:17,804 --> 01:11:19,806
I never believed
that you were dead, you know.

684
01:11:27,564 --> 01:11:29,650
Strange world.

685
01:11:30,567 --> 01:11:33,362
Wouldn't you agree, Mr. Blackthorn?

686
01:11:51,797 --> 01:11:54,550
I'm what they call
an honorary consul.

687
01:11:55,259 --> 01:11:56,760
89 dollars a month.

688
01:11:56,927 --> 01:12:01,098
A one-bedroom house
with a bed too small for my taste.

689
01:12:02,808 --> 01:12:06,979
I just greet the few North Americans
that show up around here.

690
01:12:08,063 --> 01:12:10,065
Gold diggers,
people buying wool,

691
01:12:10,232 --> 01:12:12,276
drunkards,
an occasional runaway.

692
01:12:12,484 --> 01:12:14,736
Not many people.

693
01:12:16,655 --> 01:12:18,907
The last one came by...

694
01:12:20,701 --> 01:12:22,828
two winters past.

695
01:12:24,288 --> 01:12:26,957
I spend the rest of time
looking out the window.

696
01:12:28,709 --> 01:12:31,044
Sad story.
Not much of a life.

697
01:12:31,211 --> 01:12:32,754
No, it's not.

698
01:12:32,921 --> 01:12:35,716
But I couldn't aspire
to much more...

699
01:12:38,176 --> 01:12:39,386
Until today.

700
01:12:41,179 --> 01:12:45,350
Last night I thought
everything could change for me.

701
01:12:46,894 --> 01:12:49,813
I could even buy a huge bed

702
01:12:49,980 --> 01:12:51,732
and travel home on it,

703
01:12:51,899 --> 01:12:54,860
smiling and waving

704
01:12:55,068 --> 01:12:56,570
as I passed.

705
01:12:59,948 --> 01:13:03,535
But, Mr. Blackthorn,

706
01:13:04,077 --> 01:13:07,623
these past few hours at your side

707
01:13:07,956 --> 01:13:10,959
have reminded me of many things.

708
01:13:11,793 --> 01:13:13,670
The fatigue.

709
01:13:13,837 --> 01:13:16,840
The years of pursuit...

710
01:13:18,592 --> 01:13:21,094
Carrying out one's duty is,

711
01:13:22,346 --> 01:13:23,889
believe me,

712
01:13:25,140 --> 01:13:27,059
exhausting.

713
01:13:29,937 --> 01:13:33,607
Here, in this godforsaken village,

714
01:13:34,316 --> 01:13:36,485
I finally found some rest.

715
01:13:38,070 --> 01:13:39,738
A stupid, but

716
01:13:40,489 --> 01:13:42,449
well deserved rest.

717
01:13:43,242 --> 01:13:44,660
Yeah.

718
01:13:46,370 --> 01:13:49,373
I guess we can't be blamed
for growing older.

719
01:13:49,915 --> 01:13:52,417
We're too old to keep on playing.

720
01:13:53,377 --> 01:13:55,170
Never was a game with me.

721
01:13:55,337 --> 01:13:57,047
Of course it was.

722
01:13:57,673 --> 01:14:00,592
An absurd, deadly game.

723
01:14:01,385 --> 01:14:03,595
You never understood.
Doesn't matter.

724
01:14:04,137 --> 01:14:07,057
Of course I understood.
I was part of the game.

725
01:14:07,641 --> 01:14:09,434
But this time...

726
01:14:09,685 --> 01:14:11,228
There's no handcuffs either.

727
01:14:11,395 --> 01:14:13,105
This time you're on your own.

728
01:14:14,481 --> 01:14:16,733
No one will come to the rescue.

729
01:14:18,652 --> 01:14:20,821
Do whatever you need to do.

730
01:14:37,754 --> 01:14:38,881
Take it.

731
01:14:40,591 --> 01:14:44,261
Consider it
a way to continue resting.

732
01:14:53,312 --> 01:14:56,356
An Army battalion
is on its way here.

733
01:14:56,523 --> 01:14:58,150
I sent for them.

734
01:14:58,317 --> 01:15:01,320
This is the most important thing
to have happened around here since...

735
01:15:01,862 --> 01:15:03,947
Well, since your death.

736
01:15:07,117 --> 01:15:10,078
I'll get you to a safe place.
You'll leave

737
01:15:11,747 --> 01:15:13,498
and you'll never come back.

738
01:15:15,584 --> 01:15:18,795
Things will still be the same.

739
01:15:22,799 --> 01:15:25,552
You're a right pain in the ass,
Cassidy.

740
01:15:25,928 --> 01:15:29,890
A right fucking pain in the ass!

741
01:15:33,936 --> 01:15:35,395
We're here.

742
01:15:46,573 --> 01:15:48,283
There's food and chicha in here.

743
01:15:48,492 --> 01:15:49,534
Thanks.

744
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:54,748
I know what you are, sir.

745
01:15:56,166 --> 01:15:58,168
Please, don't steal from me.

746
01:16:02,673 --> 01:16:04,049
IvÃ¡n...

747
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:07,135
You won't say anything,
will you?

748
01:16:07,302 --> 01:16:10,430
No, sir. You're my guest.

749
01:17:31,678 --> 01:17:32,971
Dear Ryan,

750
01:17:33,722 --> 01:17:36,850
I have enough money now for us
to start a brand new life.

751
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:38,977
Maybe horses, ranching...

752
01:17:39,645 --> 01:17:42,147
I've met an old friend
of your father and mother's,

753
01:17:42,314 --> 01:17:43,815
he remembers them often.

754
01:17:44,233 --> 01:17:47,819
They were one of a kind. There's
not much blood like yours left.

755
01:17:48,695 --> 01:17:50,489
I'm on my way back.

756
01:17:50,948 --> 01:17:53,742
I don't know how long it will take,
not more than two months.

757
01:17:54,201 --> 01:17:56,912
With love, your Uncle Butch.

758
01:17:59,790 --> 01:18:01,375
I was just writing about you.

759
01:18:03,168 --> 01:18:05,254
I should have left you
at the damn clinic.

760
01:18:06,171 --> 01:18:08,340
Eduardo Apodaca

761
01:18:08,882 --> 01:18:11,385
- is a friend of yours?
- Have you seen him? Where is he?

762
01:18:11,552 --> 01:18:13,262
He's heading West
through the canyons.

763
01:18:13,428 --> 01:18:14,846
He was in Tupiza,

764
01:18:15,013 --> 01:18:19,184
but made himself scarce when he saw
the uproar caused by your resurrection.

765
01:18:19,977 --> 01:18:21,186
I haven't betrayed you,

766
01:18:21,979 --> 01:18:23,522
but my help stops here.

767
01:18:24,273 --> 01:18:26,483
What the hell are you talking about?

768
01:18:30,404 --> 01:18:31,780
Damn chicha.

769
01:18:33,282 --> 01:18:34,616
Is it money you're after?

770
01:18:35,409 --> 01:18:38,328
You can stick
your dirty money where it fits.

771
01:18:38,745 --> 01:18:42,583
You were better off dead, Cassidy.
And I hope you soon will be.

772
01:18:44,042 --> 01:18:45,836
I'll drink until I forget this.

773
01:18:46,211 --> 01:18:47,838
But for you,

774
01:18:48,422 --> 01:18:51,675
all the liquor in this shitty
world wouldn't be enough.

775
01:18:54,595 --> 01:18:57,806
In my day, the outlaws
would have robbed banks!

776
01:18:57,973 --> 01:18:59,850
And the Union Pacific!

777
01:19:00,267 --> 01:19:03,770
They would never have stolen
from the mining families, no sir!

778
01:19:04,104 --> 01:19:07,482
Mining families? You better
get off the bottle, MacKinley!

779
01:19:07,649 --> 01:19:10,110
- You're losing your Irish mind.
- Go to Hell!

780
01:19:10,319 --> 01:19:12,029
He never stole
from the miner families.

781
01:19:12,571 --> 01:19:15,657
It's PatiÃ±o, the Suyana Mine.

782
01:19:16,241 --> 01:19:17,367
You believe that?

783
01:19:18,285 --> 01:19:20,787
He tricked you
and into believing that?

784
01:19:20,954 --> 01:19:23,457
Jesus, I almost pity you.

785
01:19:24,333 --> 01:19:26,752
Your Spanish friend
didn't work for PatiÃ±o.

786
01:19:26,919 --> 01:19:28,295
He worked for the miners.

787
01:19:28,712 --> 01:19:30,255
The mine is theirs.

788
01:19:30,422 --> 01:19:32,674
They took it from PatiÃ±o
two years ago.

789
01:19:32,841 --> 01:19:37,012
What rock were you hiding under?
The whole country was talking about it!

790
01:19:38,180 --> 01:19:40,515
The miners rebelled
against the owners.

791
01:19:40,682 --> 01:19:43,143
Overdue wages, murders...
The usual.

792
01:19:43,310 --> 01:19:46,688
There was a huge battle.
A lot of miners got killed.

793
01:19:48,023 --> 01:19:50,734
Then Justice stepped in and,

794
01:19:50,943 --> 01:19:52,486
this country is full of surprises,

795
01:19:52,986 --> 01:19:55,113
they decided
in favor of the miners.

796
01:19:55,572 --> 01:19:59,159
They awarded ownership of the
mine to the surviving families.

797
01:19:59,535 --> 01:20:01,411
This is no coincidence,
of course.

798
01:20:01,954 --> 01:20:03,914
The mine was almost empty.

799
01:20:04,748 --> 01:20:08,794
Even the Spanish engineer who worked
for PatiÃ±o stood up for them.

800
01:20:09,711 --> 01:20:12,339
Poor fools,
they trusted a Spaniard!

801
01:20:17,636 --> 01:20:20,556
There are times
when you'd prefer to be dead,

802
01:20:21,598 --> 01:20:23,392
don't you agree?

803
01:20:27,896 --> 01:20:31,024
Goodbye and good riddance,
Mr. Blackthorn.

804
01:21:35,631 --> 01:21:36,590
Here you go, sir.

805
01:21:41,970 --> 01:21:44,890
We'll catch him.
He can't be far away.

806
01:21:46,558 --> 01:21:48,894
Or what do you think, Mackinley?

807
01:21:59,154 --> 01:22:00,280
No.

808
01:22:01,156 --> 01:22:02,241
It's not him.

809
01:22:02,407 --> 01:22:04,660
It's not the one
who escaped from the clinic.

810
01:22:04,826 --> 01:22:06,620
Cassidy died years ago.

811
01:22:06,787 --> 01:22:10,207
Are you crazy, Mackinley?
You recognized him yourself!

812
01:22:10,624 --> 01:22:12,084
It wasn't him.

813
01:22:13,043 --> 01:22:14,419
Of course it's him!

814
01:22:14,586 --> 01:22:18,215
This is the man I left
in my clinic, with you.

815
01:22:18,382 --> 01:22:20,968
You're a fucking sentimentalist.

816
01:22:25,055 --> 01:22:26,682
Mackinley.

817
01:22:29,810 --> 01:22:32,729
We're going to see
if you're right or not.

818
01:22:33,939 --> 01:22:35,649
We'll leave at dawn.

819
01:22:36,191 --> 01:22:37,776
And you're coming with us.

820
01:24:45,070 --> 01:24:46,947
Come on. Let's go, Kid.

821
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:54,413
Shit.

822
01:24:59,501 --> 01:25:03,255
- You'll get my suit dirty.
- It'll help keep you warm.

823
01:25:12,264 --> 01:25:15,559
Everybody will think we're dead,
and look at us!

824
01:25:16,268 --> 01:25:17,936
Strong as trees.

825
01:25:19,813 --> 01:25:21,982
Snow covered trees.

826
01:25:25,277 --> 01:25:26,612
Bolivia...

827
01:25:28,947 --> 01:25:30,490
Goddamnit, Bolivia.

828
01:25:32,701 --> 01:25:35,287
I always knew you'd be the last.

829
01:25:37,331 --> 01:25:39,416
Everybody's dead and you...

830
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:42,669
You're all alone now.

831
01:25:43,420 --> 01:25:45,422
So far from home.

832
01:25:47,341 --> 01:25:49,218
My poor friend.

833
01:25:54,181 --> 01:25:55,432
Okay...

834
01:25:56,725 --> 01:25:58,060
Do it.

835
01:26:03,106 --> 01:26:04,983
Now is a good time.

836
01:26:07,236 --> 01:26:08,362
Do it.

837
01:27:03,625 --> 01:27:05,002
James.

838
01:27:08,505 --> 01:27:10,299
Or should I say Butch?

839
01:27:11,049 --> 01:27:13,302
Mr. Butch Cassidy, himself!

840
01:27:14,386 --> 01:27:15,512
I knew it.

841
01:27:16,221 --> 01:27:18,056
That explains so many things.

842
01:27:18,390 --> 01:27:19,641
You know what?

843
01:27:19,892 --> 01:27:23,353
In Tupiza everyone was shouting

844
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:26,273
that the famous gringo outlaw
was alive.

845
01:27:26,440 --> 01:27:28,567
And me buying new clothes!

846
01:27:29,276 --> 01:27:30,861
Can you imagine?

847
01:27:32,237 --> 01:27:33,238
Take it easy.

848
01:27:33,405 --> 01:27:35,282
They must have lost a lot of time.

849
01:27:45,209 --> 01:27:47,669
So... Here we are.

850
01:27:48,378 --> 01:27:51,924
Just a few hours from freedom
and the good life.

851
01:27:54,051 --> 01:27:54,843
Are you okay?

852
01:27:55,719 --> 01:27:58,347
You can't think
I abandoned you, right?

853
01:27:58,513 --> 01:28:01,558
I just couldn't stay there
with so much going on.

854
01:28:01,725 --> 01:28:03,810
And I knew you'd turn up.

855
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:09,066
That mine didn't belong to PatiÃ±o.

856
01:28:23,997 --> 01:28:25,916
And your name
is not James Blackthorn.

857
01:28:28,210 --> 01:28:31,046
Well, we all have our secrets.

858
01:28:31,213 --> 01:28:34,007
But now all the cards
are on the table.

859
01:28:36,176 --> 01:28:38,804
No, you're right.
It wasn't his any longer.

860
01:28:38,971 --> 01:28:40,305
So what?

861
01:28:41,598 --> 01:28:43,058
It had different owners.

862
01:28:43,433 --> 01:28:45,310
Owners, anyway.

863
01:28:46,645 --> 01:28:48,772
50,000 dollars, James.

864
01:28:49,106 --> 01:28:51,149
That's no lie.
Come on!

865
01:28:51,316 --> 01:28:52,234
Let's go!

866
01:28:52,401 --> 01:28:56,196
Look, there are your mountains.
We're almost there.

867
01:28:56,572 --> 01:28:59,283
I'll be your gang now.
You and me, James...

868
01:28:59,449 --> 01:29:00,492
You and me!

869
01:29:00,659 --> 01:29:03,203
You said it yourself:
You were dead,

870
01:29:03,370 --> 01:29:05,706
breeding horses in that old house.

871
01:29:05,873 --> 01:29:09,543
Now you have money
and you have it all. Your name.

872
01:29:09,710 --> 01:29:12,254
Your life!
You're a damn legend

873
01:29:12,421 --> 01:29:13,964
and here you are.

874
01:29:14,631 --> 01:29:16,216
Here you are!

875
01:29:17,801 --> 01:29:19,219
Here I am.

876
01:29:29,605 --> 01:29:31,189
Have you gone crazy?

877
01:29:32,399 --> 01:29:34,192
Motherfucker!

878
01:29:35,193 --> 01:29:36,486
They'll be here shortly.

879
01:29:36,987 --> 01:29:39,948
- This time they've got the Army with them.
- But you shoot me!

880
01:29:41,241 --> 01:29:42,367
Son of a bitch!

881
01:29:49,291 --> 01:29:51,084
Is it the money?

882
01:29:52,127 --> 01:29:54,463
How can you, bastard!

883
01:29:54,796 --> 01:29:57,424
You never did see
the difference, did you?

884
01:30:02,387 --> 01:30:05,641
For the Indians?
For a bunch of miners?

885
01:30:05,807 --> 01:30:08,685
For them?
And what about me?

886
01:30:09,645 --> 01:30:11,521
I'm your friend!

887
01:30:11,980 --> 01:30:14,900
I gave you everything!
Everything!

888
01:30:15,150 --> 01:30:17,277
I saved your life!

889
01:30:17,486 --> 01:30:20,072
I gave you your name back!
I did!

890
01:30:20,239 --> 01:30:23,492
Difference?
What's the fucking difference?

891
01:30:23,659 --> 01:30:25,494
What's the fucking difference?

892
01:30:40,551 --> 01:30:44,179
Are you going to leave me
like this, you son of a bitch?

893
01:30:45,681 --> 01:30:47,266
Are you?

894
01:30:50,102 --> 01:30:51,186
Okay.

895
01:30:51,562 --> 01:30:52,688
Okay!

896
01:30:54,606 --> 01:30:56,191
Give the money back to them.

897
01:30:56,358 --> 01:30:58,026
Give the money back to them,

898
01:30:58,193 --> 01:31:00,487
but don't leave me here, please.

899
01:31:04,074 --> 01:31:05,325
Please.

900
01:31:15,794 --> 01:31:17,796
Damn you, Butch Cassidy!

901
01:31:18,630 --> 01:31:20,215
Damn you!

902
01:31:20,883 --> 01:31:22,885
I could have killed you!

903
01:31:23,385 --> 01:31:25,637
I could have killed you

904
01:31:26,555 --> 01:31:28,599
and I didn't.

905
01:31:32,686 --> 01:31:34,730
But they'll do it for me!

906
01:31:35,147 --> 01:31:36,773
They'll track you down

907
01:31:37,190 --> 01:31:39,943
and kill you like a dog!

908
01:31:47,451 --> 01:31:50,287
Don't leave me here, please.

909
01:32:06,929 --> 01:32:10,557
To the gallows I must go,

910
01:32:11,433 --> 01:32:13,352
I must go.

911
01:32:15,771 --> 01:32:19,149
To the gallows I must go.

912
01:32:31,203 --> 01:32:34,665
To the gallows I must go.

913
01:32:48,512 --> 01:32:49,972
Bolivia.

914
01:32:50,347 --> 01:32:53,976
Damnit! Bolivia.

915
01:33:22,045 --> 01:33:24,298
I'm just a poor

916
01:33:26,174 --> 01:33:28,594
wayfaring stranger,

917
01:33:30,679 --> 01:33:33,307
While traveling

918
01:33:34,266 --> 01:33:36,852
through this world below.

919
01:33:38,812 --> 01:33:41,106
Yet there's no sickness,

920
01:33:42,107 --> 01:33:44,526
no toil, nor danger,

921
01:33:46,737 --> 01:33:49,323
In that bright land

922
01:33:50,616 --> 01:33:52,534
to which I go.

923
01:33:52,701 --> 01:33:54,244
We're not done yet.

924
01:33:54,578 --> 01:33:55,829
We'll continue.

925
01:33:55,996 --> 01:33:57,956
I'm going there

926
01:33:58,665 --> 01:34:00,751
to see my father,

927
01:34:02,836 --> 01:34:05,088
I'm goin' there

928
01:34:06,590 --> 01:34:09,426
no more to roam.

929
01:34:10,761 --> 01:34:12,221
I'm just going

930
01:34:15,015 --> 01:34:16,934
over Jordan.

931
01:34:19,519 --> 01:34:21,396
I'm just going

932
01:34:23,315 --> 01:34:25,108
over home.

933
01:34:26,985 --> 01:34:29,446
I'm just going

934
01:34:30,864 --> 01:34:32,199
over Jordan.

935
01:34:34,785 --> 01:34:37,079
I'm just going

936
01:34:38,830 --> 01:34:42,167
over home.

937
01:34:50,759 --> 01:34:52,719
You know what, Mackinley?

938
01:34:53,804 --> 01:34:57,683
This place is famous
for how easy it is to get lost.

939
01:34:58,976 --> 01:35:01,019
You helped the gringo.

940
01:35:03,272 --> 01:35:05,649
We'll take your horse.

941
01:35:07,317 --> 01:35:11,280
So pray the God of the Mountains
spares your life.
