1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,354
But cancer or madness
contort reality.

2
00:00:03,754 --> 00:00:07,154
The possibility I'm talking
about pierces reality.

3
00:00:09,054 --> 00:00:11,354
I'm unable to say it, maybe.

4
00:00:12,054 --> 00:00:15,854
Maybe it's impossible to say,
maybe I'm too stupid.

5
00:00:17,754 --> 00:00:19,554
You're looking at me as if you...

6
00:00:20,654 --> 00:00:23,664
You're looking at me as if to tell me
that I need you to fill me up,

7
00:00:23,665 --> 00:00:25,137
as if I'm an empty space.

8
00:00:25,754 --> 00:00:28,454
Well, I love you too,
but what makes me go on

9
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:31,354
is to know he'll return,
and I'll make him suffer, and...

10
00:00:31,754 --> 00:00:33,354
And I'll hurt him, and...

11
00:00:33,754 --> 00:00:35,154
I'm betraying him, but...

12
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:37,454
this brings me small rewards.

13
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,552
Well... But yet, I...

14
00:00:40,587 --> 00:00:44,754
I can't exist by myself
because I'm afraid of myself.

15
00:00:44,954 --> 00:00:47,254
Because I'm the maker of my own evil.

16
00:00:48,745 --> 00:00:49,644
Because...

17
00:00:51,881 --> 00:00:53,090
Because I'm...

18
00:00:58,254 --> 00:01:01,254
Goodness is only some kind
of reflection upon evil.

19
00:01:01,754 --> 00:01:03,054
That's the way it is.

20
00:01:24,954 --> 00:01:26,154
What are you doing?!

21
00:01:26,254 --> 00:01:29,254
I'm sorting out his things
to take to the laundry.

22
00:01:36,854 --> 00:01:40,554
I can do it myself.
-But it's my job!

23
00:01:41,104 --> 00:01:43,154
Very kind of...
-I'm better at it!

24
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:46,654
Maybe you could do it
when Bob is at home.

25
00:02:04,054 --> 00:02:08,636
It's getting... so difficult
for you, isn't it? You're not as...

26
00:02:09,654 --> 00:02:12,633
You're not as strong or as sure of
yourself as you thought you were,

27
00:02:12,634 --> 00:02:16,319
so you keep coming back.
You must be...

28
00:02:16,754 --> 00:02:20,615
You must be...
torn apart.

29
00:02:25,753 --> 00:02:29,098
I can...
I can think more clearly now.

30
00:02:31,346 --> 00:02:32,376
I guess ...

31
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:35,254
I guess when you're there...

32
00:02:36,454 --> 00:02:38,454
you want to be home,
and when you're home...

33
00:02:40,554 --> 00:02:42,054
you want to be there.

34
00:02:48,354 --> 00:02:51,054
If what you have there
is so strong for you,

35
00:02:51,354 --> 00:02:53,354
if it's what you never had,

36
00:02:53,854 --> 00:02:55,854
stick to it. Keep it.

37
00:03:00,654 --> 00:03:03,354
It's very quiet here when you're,
when you're out.

38
00:03:06,354 --> 00:03:10,454
It was very quiet
when you weren't here!

39
00:03:12,754 --> 00:03:15,554
Come over here,
let's just see if we can

40
00:03:15,754 --> 00:03:18,254
sit together peacefully, still.

41
00:03:33,554 --> 00:03:35,154
Is it the same there?
-No!

42
00:03:37,554 --> 00:03:38,954
Can you tell me now?

43
00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:44,154
I messed everything up.
Even Bob.

44
00:03:44,354 --> 00:03:47,054
I've been a cheat, a liar,

45
00:03:47,354 --> 00:03:50,154
completely alone, wounded.

46
00:03:51,154 --> 00:03:53,854
And you think I'm immoral shit.

47
00:03:53,954 --> 00:03:57,052
I think so too but not

48
00:03:57,454 --> 00:03:59,654
the... same reasons...

49
00:04:09,054 --> 00:04:12,054
I feel nothing for no-one!

50
00:04:17,354 --> 00:04:21,154
It's as if the two sisters
were too exhausted to fight anymore.

51
00:04:21,654 --> 00:04:24,854
You know these women
wrestling in an arena of mud,

52
00:04:25,354 --> 00:04:28,074
with their hands locked
at each other's throats.

53
00:04:28,075 --> 00:04:30,876
Each waiting to see
who'll die first.

54
00:04:31,654 --> 00:04:34,054
And both staring at me.

55
00:09:07,754 --> 00:09:11,054
What I miscarried there
was Sister Faith.

56
00:09:11,654 --> 00:09:14,854
And what was left is Sister Chance.

57
00:09:16,054 --> 00:09:19,354
So I had to take care of my Faith,

58
00:09:19,754 --> 00:09:21,754
to protect it.

59
00:09:23,154 --> 00:09:24,854
That's what you're doing there?

60
00:09:25,863 --> 00:09:27,225
Yes.

61
00:09:34,254 --> 00:09:35,754
You look uglier.

62
00:09:37,554 --> 00:09:38,754
You've hardened.

63
00:09:39,054 --> 00:09:40,954
For the first time, you look...

64
00:09:42,654 --> 00:09:44,254
vulgar, to me.

65
00:09:57,954 --> 00:09:59,654
I remember when I was a kid...

66
00:10:01,354 --> 00:10:04,254
Have you ever seen a dying dog,
you know, one of those old

67
00:10:04,454 --> 00:10:08,454
dogs that comes to die under the,
under the porch of the house?

68
00:10:09,354 --> 00:10:10,754
At the last moment...

69
00:10:10,854 --> 00:10:14,054
It... yelps.

70
00:10:14,954 --> 00:10:16,154
In terror.

71
00:10:17,654 --> 00:10:19,954
As if it's seen something real.

72
00:10:25,054 --> 00:10:27,069
I want you to take off
the ring and the wristwatch

73
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:29,118
I gave you last time I came home.

74
00:10:42,354 --> 00:10:44,154
Don't forget to give him his yoghurt.

75
00:10:44,706 --> 00:10:45,334
No.

76
00:10:48,354 --> 00:10:49,454
I have to go!

77
00:10:51,204 --> 00:10:55,154
If I threw myself at your feet and
yelped, would you still walk over me?

78
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:56,154
Yes.

79
00:11:03,054 --> 00:11:06,154
Hello, this is Anna's husband speaking.
-Anna's not here.

80
00:11:06,354 --> 00:11:09,254
I don't have the slightest idea
what's happening to her.

81
00:11:09,429 --> 00:11:11,454
Do you love your son?
-Sir!

82
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,454
Tell him that I love him too.

83
00:11:13,754 --> 00:11:16,754
I love everybody and everything.
I accept everything,

84
00:11:16,854 --> 00:11:20,354
I have become wise,
and profound, and good.

85
00:11:20,454 --> 00:11:23,354
Do you want to talk to him?
We're just having coffee.

86
00:11:23,854 --> 00:11:25,154
No, I don't want to talk to him, I...

87
00:11:26,054 --> 00:11:29,154
I don't want your coffee to get cold,
either, I certainly love your coffee.

88
00:11:29,254 --> 00:11:31,254
Just tell Heinrich
that Anna's address

89
00:11:31,354 --> 00:11:33,454
is Sebastianstrasse 87.

90
00:11:34,154 --> 00:11:35,154
First floor.

91
00:11:35,454 --> 00:11:37,554
Five, six, seven, sky!

92
00:11:38,481 --> 00:11:41,048
Eight, seven,
six, five, four, three...

93
00:11:41,154 --> 00:11:45,092
Madam teacher, my apologies
for being late. -No, it's alright.

94
00:11:47,054 --> 00:11:49,954
Anyway, we were waiting for you.
Thank you.

95
00:11:50,554 --> 00:11:51,854
And goodbye, Bob.

96
00:12:16,254 --> 00:12:17,354
what is it?

97
00:12:18,454 --> 00:12:19,554
My name.

98
00:12:54,954 --> 00:12:57,854
I respected your wish to be alone,
I thought you needed the time,

99
00:12:57,954 --> 00:12:59,654
but now it's time enough.

100
00:13:01,729 --> 00:13:03,904
Besides, what are you doing here, anyway?

101
00:13:05,454 --> 00:13:06,754
Don't resist me.

102
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:09,254
You know I'm stronger than you.

103
00:13:10,654 --> 00:13:13,354
I'm the only one in your life
who has rights on you.

104
00:13:13,654 --> 00:13:15,554
Because I don't claim any.

105
00:13:22,854 --> 00:13:24,354
I brought it from India.

106
00:13:25,665 --> 00:13:29,454
You know, this is what the French
poet Michaux was writing about.

107
00:13:30,754 --> 00:13:32,254
I kept it for you.

108
00:13:33,454 --> 00:13:34,554
With this,

109
00:13:35,154 --> 00:13:38,554
love opens to absolutely
unknown horizons.

110
00:13:40,954 --> 00:13:43,154
Absolutely unknown...

111
00:13:48,554 --> 00:13:51,354
We are made to swim
in the center of the stream.

112
00:13:51,854 --> 00:13:53,754
Not to wait on the dry banks.

113
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:59,554
Yes ... exactly.

114
00:13:59,854 --> 00:14:01,754
I showed you the door to God.

115
00:14:03,154 --> 00:14:06,583
And this door is always open.
Come.

116
00:14:47,854 --> 00:14:49,004
Is this a joke?

117
00:15:03,254 --> 00:15:04,304
What is it?

118
00:15:29,574 --> 00:15:30,783
Anna!

119
00:15:38,454 --> 00:15:40,254
These must be removed.

120
00:15:41,154 --> 00:15:43,454
They are beginning to smell.

121
00:15:50,954 --> 00:15:52,254
This can't be true.

122
00:15:52,554 --> 00:15:55,154
I've got to keep this
place clean and well.

123
00:15:56,054 --> 00:15:59,154
Oh my God!
-Are you going to help me,

124
00:15:59,155 --> 00:16:00,462
Heinrich?

125
00:16:01,854 --> 00:16:05,854
You are no different
from anyone else.

126
00:16:06,654 --> 00:16:08,854
We are all the same.

127
00:16:10,154 --> 00:16:11,754
But in different words.

128
00:16:12,254 --> 00:16:14,354
In different bodies.

129
00:16:15,254 --> 00:16:17,254
Different versions.

130
00:16:17,954 --> 00:16:19,354
Like insects!

131
00:16:20,254 --> 00:16:21,354
Meat!

132
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:47,354
Calling all ambulances and
fire engines to the site of the crash.

133
00:17:47,854 --> 00:17:49,554
And two trucks!

134
00:17:55,554 --> 00:17:56,554
Where?

135
00:17:58,254 --> 00:17:59,654
Can you answer the door, Bob?

136
00:18:01,704 --> 00:18:03,054
Now listen, Heinrich.

137
00:18:03,454 --> 00:18:05,054
Just stay where you are.

138
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,154
At the bar at the corner?

139
00:18:09,804 --> 00:18:11,154
Bleed for a while.

140
00:18:11,654 --> 00:18:13,454
I'll be there as soon as I can.

141
00:18:13,451 --> 00:18:15,519
My son took the car.

142
00:18:16,147 --> 00:18:17,521
An automatic one...

143
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:19,854
Can you look after Bob
till I get back? -What is it?

144
00:18:23,954 --> 00:18:25,754
It's Mommy calling me.

145
00:21:59,454 --> 00:22:02,954
No, not, not here.
Go to the toilet.

146
00:22:07,554 --> 00:22:08,754
Need a Tampax?

147
00:22:08,854 --> 00:22:11,454
How can you joke
while I'm so hurt?

148
00:22:12,154 --> 00:22:14,954
There are corpses in there.
At least two bodies.

149
00:22:15,354 --> 00:22:18,254
I thought she was pulling
my leg, but no, there's blood.

150
00:22:18,354 --> 00:22:22,454
She cuts them. A monster,
a joke, but it was alive.

151
00:22:22,554 --> 00:22:23,954
You're drunk, Heinrich.

152
00:22:24,054 --> 00:22:27,954
She cuts us to pieces, Mark!
-Maybe she just didn't want to see you.

153
00:22:28,054 --> 00:22:31,454
Don't joke, I am not joking!
-Alright, I'm not joking.

154
00:22:31,554 --> 00:22:33,254
So what do you want?
-Don't you understand?

155
00:22:33,354 --> 00:22:34,654
She's killing people.

156
00:22:34,754 --> 00:22:38,054
I understand she's killing people,
so why do you call me and not the police?

157
00:22:38,154 --> 00:22:40,454
She is sick, Mark,
doesn't that mean anything to you?

158
00:22:40,554 --> 00:22:43,454
There are dead bodies there!
-I don't believe you.

159
00:22:43,854 --> 00:22:46,754
Maybe you're stoned
on some shit you suck on.

160
00:22:47,054 --> 00:22:48,754
Some mushroom you gobble?

161
00:22:49,354 --> 00:22:51,154
Perhaps you did it to yourself.

162
00:22:51,754 --> 00:22:53,750
Maybe you're learning how to suffer.

163
00:22:53,751 --> 00:22:56,754
Now that would be an achievement!
-I feel for people!

164
00:22:56,854 --> 00:22:59,354
You talk for people,
you take their wives.

165
00:22:59,554 --> 00:23:01,354
I take what I want!

166
00:23:02,554 --> 00:23:04,454
And I'm at peace with myself.

167
00:23:05,054 --> 00:23:07,154
Nobody saw me come in, nobody.

168
00:23:07,654 --> 00:23:10,654
I called you because we have
to do something to help her.

169
00:23:10,754 --> 00:23:11,754
What?

170
00:23:11,854 --> 00:23:14,354
It isn't normal,
it wasn't even human.

171
00:23:14,654 --> 00:23:15,354
It was ...

172
00:23:15,629 --> 00:23:16,654
Divine?

173
00:23:17,254 --> 00:23:21,454
Perhaps you met God a moment
ago, and you didn't even realize it.

174
00:23:22,154 --> 00:23:24,454
Now, you believe in God,
don't you? Certainly.

175
00:23:24,854 --> 00:23:27,454
That great incomprehensible God

176
00:23:27,554 --> 00:23:30,754
whom you reached through
fucking, or dope.

177
00:23:32,154 --> 00:23:33,854
Am I right?
-Look, Mark.

178
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:37,254
That woman is crazy.
We have to do something.

179
00:23:37,554 --> 00:23:38,454
We?

180
00:23:39,254 --> 00:23:42,554
I'm not going to do anything.
-I can't leave it this way,

181
00:23:42,654 --> 00:23:44,654
it's Anna, it's murder!

182
00:23:44,754 --> 00:23:46,754
You are not a man, Mark,
you're a woman.

183
00:23:46,831 --> 00:23:50,631
Alright, if you don't intend to do
anything and want to keep me silent,

184
00:23:50,632 --> 00:23:51,632
you will have to pay.

185
00:23:51,654 --> 00:23:54,754
You have money, I know it.
You have to get me out of here,

186
00:23:54,854 --> 00:23:57,654
and send me on a long trip
to restore my harmony!

187
00:23:57,754 --> 00:23:58,954
I deserve it!

188
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:01,354
If you had only seen what I saw!

189
00:25:16,454 --> 00:25:19,454
Heinrich, help me out
of here, I'm sick!

190
00:25:20,054 --> 00:25:22,554
I'm the one who is wounded,
not you!

191
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:24,054
Please!

192
00:26:53,354 --> 00:26:55,854
God's light avenge them!

193
00:26:56,354 --> 00:26:58,054
Giving it out clean,

194
00:26:58,354 --> 00:27:00,754
and getting it back dirty!

195
00:29:25,254 --> 00:29:27,254
Do you believe in God?

196
00:29:29,793 --> 00:29:30,892
God?

197
00:29:31,954 --> 00:29:33,354
It's in me.

198
00:29:57,854 --> 00:29:59,354
Take me.

199
00:30:43,954 --> 00:30:45,847
Did Margit see it?
-Yes.

200
00:30:45,854 --> 00:30:49,154
That's why you killed her?
-She tried to take it away from me.

201
00:30:49,254 --> 00:30:53,654
Is this Faith that helped us?
-It needs to be protected.

202
00:30:53,804 --> 00:30:55,354
Like a child?
-Yes.

203
00:30:58,154 --> 00:30:59,354
You know, for me,

204
00:31:00,204 --> 00:31:03,854
God is still under the porch,
where the dog died.

205
00:31:05,554 --> 00:31:07,754
And on the branch of the Eucalyptus tree

206
00:31:08,554 --> 00:31:10,112
where I'd lie for hours,

207
00:31:10,621 --> 00:31:14,958
and watch how the clouds
change the color of the grass below.

208
00:31:16,554 --> 00:31:17,754
I need money.

209
00:31:18,154 --> 00:31:19,754
I had to leave there.

210
00:31:20,854 --> 00:31:22,254
Oh, I've cleaned all the mess,

211
00:31:22,554 --> 00:31:24,354
I washed the floor,
I made the bed.

212
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:26,113
I didn't know where to go.

213
00:31:26,354 --> 00:31:27,804
It became so unsafe there,

214
00:31:27,805 --> 00:31:30,791
people couldn't stop
trying to take it away from me.

215
00:31:30,943 --> 00:31:31,943
Okay.

216
00:31:32,654 --> 00:31:34,254
Now, leave me the car.

217
00:31:35,154 --> 00:31:38,254
Take Margit's keys and
go to her place and wait there.

218
00:31:39,354 --> 00:31:40,954
Can you drive a motorbike?

219
00:31:42,354 --> 00:31:43,754
Heinrich taught me.

220
00:31:43,954 --> 00:31:46,654
It's outside. Now, I'll take
care of Bob and everything.

221
00:31:46,754 --> 00:31:49,354
I'll go to the bank on Monday
and take the money out.

222
00:31:50,454 --> 00:31:53,992
If Bob wakes up,
tell him...

223
00:31:54,654 --> 00:31:55,754
I will.

224
00:32:08,654 --> 00:32:10,854
It's only me. Go to sleep.

225
00:32:12,354 --> 00:32:15,254
I have to go.
Please close the door.

226
00:32:16,054 --> 00:32:18,254
Because it's here with you?
-Yes!

227
00:33:38,254 --> 00:33:40,054
I'm sorry to disturb you, but...
-Yes?

228
00:33:40,254 --> 00:33:43,954
You understand that it is very late,
and Heinrich hasn't called me yet.

229
00:33:44,554 --> 00:33:48,154
He calls me every night so I won't
worry about when he comes home.

230
00:33:48,348 --> 00:33:49,389
Maybe ...

231
00:33:50,454 --> 00:33:52,354
Maybe he just forgot your number.

232
00:33:52,454 --> 00:33:54,154
No, you don't understand.

233
00:33:54,554 --> 00:33:57,754
Mothers always feel it
when their sons are in trouble.

234
00:33:58,554 --> 00:33:59,954
Are you worried ...

235
00:34:01,054 --> 00:34:04,354
Are you worried that he's not there
having sex with my wife?

236
00:34:04,454 --> 00:34:05,954
They should come here.

237
00:34:06,054 --> 00:34:09,154
I've put clean sheets on the bed,
and they could have dinner.

238
00:34:10,254 --> 00:34:12,354
Are you quite sure you know
who you're talking to?

239
00:34:12,454 --> 00:34:13,754
I am.

240
00:34:14,454 --> 00:34:16,354
I went there.
-Where?

241
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:18,454
I was worried, you understand.

242
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:21,854
There isn't any apartment there
under the address you gave me.

243
00:34:21,954 --> 00:34:26,454
There's only a smoking hole that the
police won't allow anybody to come near.

244
00:34:26,854 --> 00:34:30,554
So I went to a bar at the corner,
to call home, to find out

245
00:34:31,554 --> 00:34:33,654
if Heinrich had returned.

246
00:34:34,354 --> 00:34:35,254
Yes?

247
00:34:35,354 --> 00:34:37,754
And Heinrich was there.

248
00:34:38,954 --> 00:34:40,710
Nobody could identify him.

249
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:41,853
Yes?

250
00:34:41,854 --> 00:34:44,254
I recognized his body,
of course.

251
00:34:44,454 --> 00:34:47,654
Did you... identify it
for the police?

252
00:34:47,754 --> 00:34:52,454
No, it was only Heinrich's body.
But his soul was not there.

253
00:34:56,054 --> 00:34:58,854
Perhaps he and the soul
had parted company before.

254
00:34:58,954 --> 00:35:00,954
You don't know what
you're talking about.

255
00:35:01,354 --> 00:35:04,854
No, no, you're quite right. I don't
have any idea what I'm talking about.

256
00:35:04,954 --> 00:35:08,454
He must have seemed to you
better and more beautiful than you.

257
00:35:08,954 --> 00:35:12,254
When Anna met him,
she immediately worshipped his soul.

258
00:35:12,454 --> 00:35:14,554
And you sent him there.

259
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:16,954
Now, listen to me.

260
00:35:17,754 --> 00:35:22,454
I recognize Heinrich's
superiority in every way.

261
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:24,654
I was... proud

262
00:35:25,354 --> 00:35:27,054
that Anna accepted him.

263
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:30,554
Now, Anna...
has gone missing.

264
00:35:31,275 --> 00:35:34,954
AAnd... I'm here,
all alone, you understand?

265
00:35:35,554 --> 00:35:36,954
With our little son.

266
00:35:37,554 --> 00:35:39,954
Now, I must find her,
maybe it's her fault.

267
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:43,854
I'll find her, and I'll force her
to tell me what she's done.

268
00:35:44,454 --> 00:35:45,854
With Heinrich's soul.

269
00:35:47,554 --> 00:35:49,154
And then I'll come to you.

270
00:35:50,254 --> 00:35:51,354
And tell you.

271
00:36:19,454 --> 00:36:21,654
Won't you come up?
-I'm in a rush.

272
00:36:21,904 --> 00:36:24,355
Is it your wife?
-Here.

273
00:36:25,354 --> 00:36:28,137
Will you promise me something?
-Yes?

274
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:31,554
Whatever it is?

275
00:36:34,854 --> 00:36:35,954
I promise.

276
00:38:34,754 --> 00:38:36,054
Almost.

277
00:38:55,524 --> 00:38:57,496
Almost.
-Yes.

278
00:39:18,954 --> 00:39:20,354
Heinrich's dead.

279
00:39:21,754 --> 00:39:24,163
Isn't he?
-Yes.

280
00:39:25,754 --> 00:39:29,570
And you found Anna?
-Yes.

281
00:39:39,954 --> 00:39:42,254
You come like the Angel of Death.

282
00:39:43,454 --> 00:39:44,854
The one who kills.

283
00:39:45,354 --> 00:39:48,554
I have thought about killing him.
-And now?

284
00:39:50,354 --> 00:39:51,654
And now I don't know.

285
00:39:53,854 --> 00:39:56,954
Did you see anything
that made you change your mind?

286
00:39:57,254 --> 00:39:59,654
I don't know what I saw,
but Heinrich saw it too.

287
00:39:59,854 --> 00:40:02,054
And you came to tell me
that you don't know...

288
00:40:03,154 --> 00:40:04,954
where Heinrich's soul is?

289
00:40:06,854 --> 00:40:07,754
Yes.

290
00:40:09,254 --> 00:40:11,154
I can see it in your face.

291
00:40:13,654 --> 00:40:17,954
It would be good to think that the
soul lives separately from the body.

292
00:40:19,154 --> 00:40:22,654
That the soul lives forever,
and the body only for a time.

293
00:40:24,254 --> 00:40:25,654
But it isn't so.

294
00:40:28,754 --> 00:40:30,854
I don't know anymore.
-I do.

295
00:40:36,754 --> 00:40:40,654
I have to be
on my son's side.

296
00:40:41,654 --> 00:40:43,554
Even if he's made you unhappy.

297
00:40:45,854 --> 00:40:48,554
I know all there is
to know about him.

298
00:40:50,954 --> 00:40:54,758
That I love him.
-Yes.

299
00:40:55,754 --> 00:40:58,254
I was wondering
which is worse:

300
00:40:59,954 --> 00:41:01,854
Take away someone's wife,

301
00:41:02,854 --> 00:41:04,154
hurt a child,

302
00:41:06,254 --> 00:41:07,354
or to kill?

303
00:41:12,554 --> 00:41:15,254
He also had a wife
and a child.

304
00:41:17,154 --> 00:41:18,654
I used to like her.

305
00:41:19,254 --> 00:41:20,954
I liked your Anna too.

306
00:41:22,654 --> 00:41:24,554
I had to like both of them.

307
00:41:26,154 --> 00:41:27,954
Since they loved him.

308
00:41:29,254 --> 00:41:31,454
The world is only what it is.

309
00:41:44,254 --> 00:41:46,954
Murderous.
If we are the best of it.

310
00:41:49,554 --> 00:41:51,954
You don't have to worry about me.

311
00:41:55,854 --> 00:41:57,554
I don't want to be here.

312
00:41:59,604 --> 00:42:02,854
If Heinrich is not around anymore.

313
00:43:03,454 --> 00:43:06,154
That dog didn't die of old age.

314
00:43:06,954 --> 00:43:09,054
What about you, Mark?

315
00:43:13,454 --> 00:43:16,554
Our man won't confide
or deal with your successor,

316
00:43:16,704 --> 00:43:17,754
he wants you.

317
00:43:18,154 --> 00:43:20,754
In fact, Mark,
there is no successor.

318
00:43:20,979 --> 00:43:23,029
We can take care of drowning dogs,

319
00:43:23,129 --> 00:43:25,654
but please help us take care
of the drowning world!

320
00:43:25,754 --> 00:43:28,854
Don't you think it's uneconomical
to waste yourself on dogs?

321
00:43:29,154 --> 00:43:31,054
Even dogs you love?

322
00:43:32,254 --> 00:43:34,454
I met a man who loved everything.

323
00:43:36,054 --> 00:43:38,154
And he died in a flood of shit.

324
00:43:38,254 --> 00:43:40,454
We know.
That's just details.

325
00:43:41,754 --> 00:43:43,254
When I was a boy ...

326
00:43:44,154 --> 00:43:46,754
I had a dog
and his name was Louie.

327
00:43:47,054 --> 00:43:49,454
When he crawled
under the porch to die,

328
00:43:50,354 --> 00:43:52,554
I stayed there with him.
-So what?

329
00:43:55,754 --> 00:43:58,054
I wanted to see what it was

330
00:43:59,054 --> 00:44:00,954
that made him crawl under there.

331
00:44:01,954 --> 00:44:03,854
Nobody's a boy anymore.

332
00:44:04,054 --> 00:44:05,554
Must we prove it?

333
00:44:49,654 --> 00:44:52,854
Back up, then full speed,
and crash into the police car.

334
00:44:54,154 --> 00:44:55,454
My pleasure, sir.

335
00:45:18,654 --> 00:45:19,854
Anna, the car!

336
00:48:03,554 --> 00:48:04,554
Anna!

337
00:48:05,604 --> 00:48:07,554
Run away, go!

338
00:48:19,654 --> 00:48:21,654
How could you find me?

339
00:48:23,554 --> 00:48:25,354
How could I not?

340
00:48:43,654 --> 00:48:45,454
I wanted to show it to you.

341
00:48:46,154 --> 00:48:47,854
It is finished now.

342
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:56,395
Oh yes.

343
00:50:32,354 --> 00:50:35,054
So hard to live with it,
eh, Brother?

344
00:50:55,554 --> 00:50:57,054
Is there a way out?

345
00:51:00,554 --> 00:51:02,997
Will you help me?
-Yes.

346
00:51:05,954 --> 00:51:07,154
Take it.

347
00:51:10,454 --> 00:51:11,554
Shoot them.

348
00:51:26,354 --> 00:51:28,954
How do you want
to finish it?

349
00:51:56,904 --> 00:51:58,454
Would you open it, please?

350
00:52:00,229 --> 00:52:01,554
Why not, Bob?

351
00:52:02,254 --> 00:52:03,754
It could be your father.

352
00:52:04,354 --> 00:52:07,354
Don't open.
-Oh, but I want to.

353
00:52:08,629 --> 00:52:10,379
Don't open.
-But I want to!

354
00:52:10,479 --> 00:52:11,554
Don't open!

355
00:52:17,254 --> 00:52:19,054
Please, don't open!

356
00:52:20,054 --> 00:52:30,054
