00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:38,089
Oh, yeah.

2
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:48,634
Tiptoe, hello.

3
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:51,676
Pow!

4
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:04,614
Shit!

5
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:12,957
Shit!

6
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:25,601
Breathe beauty in,

7
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:28,045
breathe nasty out.

8
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:31,016
Beauty in...

9
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:34,042
nasty out.

10
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,124
Ah.

11
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,888
My head is bleeding?

12
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:46,389
Damn!

13
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,029
"Pacific Crest"...

14
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:52,731
What am I doing here?

15
00:02:58,278 --> 00:03:01,645
Who hit you?

16
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:06,076
I can't remember
a thing.

17
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:08,917
What's your name?

18
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:12,422
What is your name?

19
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,858
Why can't you
remember anything, huh?

20
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:18,694
Happy birthday, G...

21
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:21,393
Gggh...

22
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:24,297
Hello, this is...

23
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,275
It's okay, rela... okay,
I... I oughta have a wallet.

24
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,302
I'm missing my wallet!
Should have some ID.

25
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:36,076
What's this?

26
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:38,413
"Storage check. "

27
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:42,284
Who are you, man?

28
00:03:58,104 --> 00:04:00,937
Come on. Come on, man.

29
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:04,603
No! No no no.

30
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:07,306
Shit.

31
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,747
What the hell is this?

32
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:15,413
Holy shit!
No way!

33
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:24,961
Wait a minute.
This is a lot of money, man.

34
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:27,432
This ain't right,
this ain't right.

35
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:34,729
Hello, front desk.

36
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,503
Eh, um...

37
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:38,908
- Hello?
- It-it...

38
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,276
- Sir?
- It-it...

39
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:41,644
- Hello?
- Bye.

40
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:44,411
Hel...

41
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,559
Refill minibar?

42
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:04,502
- What?
- Refill minibar?

43
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:06,869
- Refill the minibar?
- Yes.

44
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:08,703
No, man...
some other time.

45
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:17,542
Help!

46
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,813
Police!

47
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:30,890
Hello.

48
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:47,872
Let's go!
Go!

49
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:51,782
Go! Go! Go! Go!

50
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:54,582
Go! Go! Go!

51
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,384
Go! Go!

52
00:05:57,423 --> 00:06:00,392
- God, ma'am, I'm sorry.
- Ssh!

53
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:02,018
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- Shhh...

54
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:04,086
Hmm?

55
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:09,792
Bye.

56
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:20,468
- Jake? Jake!
- Huh?

57
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:23,141
You know me?

58
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:26,208
- Are you kidding?
- No, I'm not kidding.

59
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:28,345
Hey, what happened
to your head?

60
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:34,491
- I gotta go.
- Whoa! Whoa whoa whoa.

61
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:36,757
Just relax, you're
gonna be fine.

62
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:38,593
I'm here to help you.

63
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:41,430
Over here.

64
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:44,129
Hmm?

65
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:47,402
Roger, Dispatch...

66
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:51,336
Come on.

67
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:54,312
- Huh?
- Let's go!

68
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:55,712
Okay.

69
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:58,707
In the car.

70
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:12,063
Wait wait wait
wait wait wait.

71
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,589
What the hell is going on
and who are you anyway?

72
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:17,000
You really don't know
who I am?

73
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:19,732
No. I mean,
I have no damn idea

74
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,603
- who you are.
- You don't remember anything?

75
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:24,371
I think that's been
established, okay? L...

76
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,105
What were you
doing at the hotel?

77
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:27,806
I came to pick you up.

78
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:32,643
- You called me.
- I did?

79
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:34,949
Wh... what was I doing
at the hotel?

80
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:37,717
I don't know. What were you
doing at the hotel, Jake?

81
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:44,321
You really have
no idea who I am?

82
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:48,026
No, I have no idea!

83
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:51,093
What are you doing?

84
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,435
Are you crying?

85
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,101
Don... don't cry.
Why are you crying?

86
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:59,600
I can't believe you don't
remember your own wife.

87
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,544
Wife?
I'm married?

88
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,074
To a white woman?

89
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:08,712
Yes, to a white woman!

90
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:10,779
Look, okay, a'ight, look look
look, calm down,

91
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,848
don't cry, okay?
Don't cry, um...

92
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:15,053
um uh uh,
whatever your name is.

93
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:17,460
Diane.
My name is Diane.

94
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,364
Of course. I call you "Dynamite,"
"Di Baby," "Di Baby. "

95
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:23,163
No no. You don't call me that.
You call me Diane.

96
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:25,932
Of course I call you "Diane. "
There's no... okay, Diane.

97
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:28,338
Don't cry, baby,
all right? It's okay.

98
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:30,842
Everything's o... come over here
and give your man a big kiss.

99
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:35,844
We are definitely
married

100
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:37,907
'cause that's
some bullshit. Ow.

101
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,544
Jake, we are gonna have
to get you all fixed up.

102
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:42,781
Yeah, why don't we do that?
Get me fixed up.

103
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,258
I need a doctor to check out
Jake immediately.

104
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:50,092
Right, he's had
an injury.

105
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:52,563
I'm bringing
my husband home.

106
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:55,999
Yes. Yes,
to the country house.

107
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:59,334
- A dead FBI agent and 250 Gs...
- Yes. We're gonna be there shortly,

108
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,999
...and I'm married!
- So get the staff ready, okay?

109
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,099
It's been a hell
of a morning.

110
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:07,204
Yes, sir. Did you notice
if your window...

111
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,408
Tell me something.

112
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:12,576
The attendant said he saw
someone leave the room.

113
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:14,279
Any description?

114
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,787
He was black.

115
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:17,254
Oh, well, now that
you solved the case,

116
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,225
- could you tell me what happened?
- I don't know.

117
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:22,625
That's all you can say?
That man was part of your team.

118
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:24,391
Look, I know.

119
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,421
Find out who this room
is registered under.

120
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:27,898
It wasn't registered
to anyone.

121
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:30,232
- What, they just let themselves in?
- Apparently.

122
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:33,432
How could you not know what one
of your agents was doing up here?

123
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:36,134
Look, with... with... with
all due respect, all he did was phone.

124
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:38,609
He left me a message saying
that he'd come up with a lead,

125
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:40,134
but he wasn't
on a secure line and...

126
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:42,773
- And?
- And then that... that's it.

127
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:46,273
He said he was gonna call me later
and that's the last I heard from him.

128
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,384
I want you to search every
surveillance tape in the hotel.

129
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:54,223
Whoever did this has to have
been seen leaving the building.

130
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:57,894
I'm on it.

131
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:15,611
Oh, what's all this?

132
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:17,479
This is where
we live.

133
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:20,815
Wait wait wait... you're trying
to tell me I got it like this?

134
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:24,084
- That's what I said, baby.
- This is where I live

135
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:27,149
and ain't none of my cousins
or nothing living all up in here?

136
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:29,286
All these cars is mine,

137
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:31,728
all that lawn is me,

138
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:34,528
and all this house
is mine?

139
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:37,263
Well, that is,
until you die...

140
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,294
then it's all mine.

141
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:42,307
My mama know
about you?

142
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:44,468
Come on, baby.

143
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,478
Come on.

144
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:51,216
Yoo-hoo,
Daddy's home.

145
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,887
Hey hey, what are
you doing, man?

146
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:58,082
Sorry, sir. I was trying
to take your briefcase.

147
00:10:58,124 --> 00:10:59,853
That's all you're gonna be
doing, is trying.

148
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:01,792
You ain't taking no
briefcase around here...

149
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:04,421
Jake! Simon's
our butler.

150
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:07,159
- Our butler?
- Oh...

151
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:10,396
my husband's having
slight memory problem.

152
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:13,371
- Memory problem, sir?
- Yes, memory problems.

153
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:16,864
Look, Simon, I can't
remember a thing right now,

154
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:20,276
but don't you worry, all right?
I'm just going to settle in

155
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:23,975
and try to get all this to work
for me, you know what I'm saying?

156
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:27,445
Now you're gonna leave me
hanging. Okay.

157
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:29,681
- Very good, sir.
- Thank you, Simon.

158
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:31,553
Thank you, madam.

159
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,785
So, uh...

160
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:37,318
what is it that I do
around here all day?

161
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:41,356
- You don't really have to do much.
- Why is that?

162
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,664
Honey, you're rich!

163
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,501
- I'm rich?
- Hmm.

164
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,099
I'm rich... I guess you don't
have to do much if you rich.

165
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:52,042
In that case, I ain't doing
nothing for the rest of the day.

166
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:55,309
As a matter of fact, I ain't gonna do
a damn thing tomorrow, either.

167
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:58,578
Except remember.
Right, angel?

168
00:11:58,617 --> 00:12:01,745
Yeah. Where
the bedroom?

169
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:05,555
Mmm?

170
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:07,559
Wait a minute...

171
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:09,891
I'm rich,
I got a big house,

172
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:11,920
married
to a white woman.

173
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:14,125
Am I Lionel Richie?

174
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:18,862
Whoo...

175
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,566
this is
all right, huh!

176
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:25,338
- So this is my bedroom?
- Our bedroom.

177
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:27,106
Yeah.

178
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:28,807
And this is my chair?

179
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:30,713
You know, it could
use some plastic,

180
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,843
and these curtains...
these, uh...

181
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:34,352
All yours.

182
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:36,684
I mean, they
don't seem like me.

183
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:38,622
I mean, they real frilly.

184
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:41,182
Well, that's because
I picked them out.

185
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:43,354
Oh, sorry, babe.

186
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:45,260
You have
exquisite taste.

187
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:46,525
Thank you.

188
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:49,898
- So those are my trophies?
- Mm-hmm.

189
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,869
So I'm karate man, huh?

190
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:09,851
Who are all
these white people?

191
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:12,858
That's my family, Jake.
Don't you recognize anyone?

192
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:15,827
Why am I not
in the picture?

193
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:19,695
- You took it, remember?
- I took it.

194
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:22,758
Of course, I took it,
I took it.

195
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,667
I mean, what are you,
Creole?

196
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:27,331
- That's right, baby.
- That's what I thought.

197
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:29,705
Them red beans
and rice is working!

198
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:32,142
Doctor Soames, madam.

199
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:34,544
- Oh, the good doctor.
- Hello.

200
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:37,071
This is Dr. Soames.
He's gonna examine you

201
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:39,744
and make you
all better.

202
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:41,582
Ahem. Good.

203
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,713
Good, 'cause I need
to remember something.

204
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:46,691
Like, first of all, where is
the bathroom around here?

205
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:49,853
- Right through that door, sir.
- Cool.

206
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:51,556
I'm gonna be ready
for the examination

207
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:54,725
in a couple of minutes...
or a half hour.

208
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:56,564
You got any magazines?

209
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:58,900
Of course.
Here they are.

210
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:04,901
- Where's my "Jet"?
- "Jet," sir?

211
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:08,038
Yeah, the small, little magazine,
like a pamphlet...

212
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,775
a lot of pictures,
"Beauty of the Week"...

213
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:11,715
for people that like to read,
but not too much.

214
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,275
I'll get one immediately.
Anything else, sir?

215
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,086
- I got a craving for Skittles.
- Skittles, sir?

216
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:21,286
Yeah, man, I love those
little bite-size, chewy candies...

217
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:24,387
They're delicious!
They get stuck in your teeth, though.

218
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,864
- Right away, sir.
- Good.

219
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:29,800
Oh, and if you
don't mind,

220
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:31,769
can you pick me up
some frozen Tater Tots?

221
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:33,237
Right away, sir.

222
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:36,605
This may be asking
for too much...

223
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:39,975
but two birthday balloons
and a pony?

224
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:42,276
And a Spiderman kite?

225
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:44,612
Spiderman kite, sir.

226
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,618
And get yourself
something nice.

227
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:49,120
You know, maybe... maybe get some
color contacts or something.

228
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:51,520
- Thank you, sir.
- It'd look nice with your outfit.

229
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:54,817
Thank you.

230
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:58,887
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, nice.

231
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:02,926
Oh hell, no.

232
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:06,494
I know I wear
no pink underwear.

233
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:08,529
Uh-uh... no,
this ain't right.

234
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,599
That ain't right.

235
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:18,711
Okay. Now, show me
the lobby.

236
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:25,651
There it is...
that's it, right there.

237
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:30,254
- Okay, I'm gonna need the master tape.
- Right.

238
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:36,031
- Okay, that does it.
- Your Skittles, sir.

239
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:39,526
That's what I'm talking
about, right there!

240
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:45,803
- Can I have a word, Diane?
- I'll be right back.

241
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:49,336
- Mm-hmm. Have a Skittle, brother.
- No thank you, sir.

242
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:52,043
Come on, man,
taste the rainbow.

243
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,611
- Good, ain't they?
- Mmm.

244
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:59,123
Mm?
Mm-hmm, yeah.

245
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:01,126
Here...

246
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,526
here's the "Jet"
Beauty of the Week. Fine.

247
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:05,860
- There's a sister.
- Lovely.

248
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:09,390
Says this girl's hobby
is slapboxing and archery.

249
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:11,528
Fascinating.

250
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:15,336
- Those my golf clubs?
- Yes, sir.

251
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:19,071
Well, let's fire
them puppies up.

252
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:21,079
Yeah. Ha.

253
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:27,073
Okay.
Here we go.

254
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:38,386
That would be
a slice, sir.

255
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:39,954
Slice of what?
Pizza?

256
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,899
- Son of a bitch!
- Uh-oh. Sorry.

257
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:47,371
Here we go.
Here we go...

258
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:49,033
What on earth
is he doing?

259
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:51,042
One wing of his brain
has shut down.

260
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:53,237
Some recent events,
recent acquaintances

261
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:55,041
have been
temporarily lost.

262
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,480
He still knows how to eat
with a fork, drive a car,

263
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,507
go to the bathroom...
and play golf.

264
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:00,711
Swing, batter!

265
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:12,192
Usually, the recovery
transpires in waves

266
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:14,563
or flashes over a
three-to-five day period.

267
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,262
Any number of things
can trigger his recovery...

268
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:19,896
a person's face, a certain
smell, a familiar sound.

269
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:23,237
We don't have five days.
How do we speed it up?

270
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:27,075
Arousal sometimes
can do it.

271
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:39,654
Oh my.

272
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:42,057
Whew, well...

273
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:44,255
That's about
enough of this.

274
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:49,766
Simon, I think
I'll take a little nap.

275
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:26,834
- Jake?
- Oh! Whoo!

276
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:28,464
Are you feeling
better?

277
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:30,338
Hell yeah!

278
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,536
I mean...

279
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:34,478
but I think I'm gonna have
the good doctor come back

280
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:36,105
and take my
blood pressure again.

281
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:37,979
Why?

282
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:40,985
'Cause of these?

283
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:44,546
You bought them
for me.

284
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:48,152
Remember?

285
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:09,471
Oh, yeah.

286
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:15,319
Still can't believe
that you don't remember me.

287
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:18,755
Well, big Jake can't
remember shit right now,

288
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:21,588
but little Jake is
screaming, "I'm home!"

289
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:23,595
Oh, come on.

290
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:26,757
Think hard.

291
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:29,494
Yeah, try and
remember something.

292
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:32,368
Anything.

293
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:35,931
Come on,
for me, baby.

294
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:38,704
Ooh! Like what?

295
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:41,713
Like...

296
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:45,044
the computer chip
you had at the hotel.

297
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,880
Computer chip?
I don't...

298
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:49,410
You went there
to return it,

299
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:51,081
- remember?
- Well, computer chip,

300
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:54,058
potato chip, chocolate chip... I don't
know what you're talking about.

301
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:56,617
I'm just so happy I'm
married to a freak!

302
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:59,722
Come on, baby.

303
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:03,196
Give me one memory.

304
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:06,204
Okay, baby, talk and
blow now, talk and blow.

305
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:08,172
Okay, a memory...
sure sure. Um...

306
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:12,268
Oh, yeah. I remember,
uh uh, combat.

307
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:14,370
Really?

308
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:17,473
Uh, oh, some place
called "Digital Arts. "

309
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:20,781
- Keep it coming, baby.
- No, you keep it coming. Come here.

310
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:22,582
- I wanna tell you something.
- Hmm?

311
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:30,655
You know what? You wait here,
I'll be right back.

312
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:33,130
Where are you going?

313
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:35,258
Did I cross the line?

314
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,530
Don't take too long!

315
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,730
Little Jake
can't be alone right now.

316
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:43,138
- That's it. I'm not going any further.
- Fine.

317
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:45,336
- Plan B then?
- Yes, do it.

318
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:49,410
What's in it?

319
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:52,110
It's a hot mix of speed
and sodium pentothal.

320
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,777
Will it make him talk?

321
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:56,481
Oh, he'll talk, all right.
But I have to tell you,

322
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:59,081
there is a chance that it could
cause his brain to scramble

323
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:01,752
- and send him into cardiac arrest.
- Cardiac arrest?

324
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:04,819
Hopefully, you'll get what you
need before his heart explodes.

325
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:06,728
Shit!

326
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,545
Whoa.

327
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:28,815
Help me.

328
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:34,491
Yes!

329
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:41,726
Damn, that was smooth.

330
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:43,564
# Get 'em up,
put 'em up #

331
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:45,627
# HP, KG,
light 'em up... #

332
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:47,969
#... All the ladies
got you going crazy #

333
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:49,940
# All the fellas
getting that gravy #

334
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,966
# Get 'em up,
keep 'em high #

335
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:54,843
# Once again, it's on
'cause everything is live #

336
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,507
# Live at the PJs #

337
00:21:56,548 --> 00:21:59,108
# But it's the nine-nine
independent Mo Treader Hot's way #

338
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,119
# Yeah, if you're looking for
the boogie, you're looking for me #

339
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,747
# Everybody wanna party
with the R.O.C. #

340
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:06,257
Gotta see what this
is all about.

341
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:11,863
Ah, man, the cops are still here!
Damn!

342
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:14,888
Huh?

343
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:17,265
Tulip Tour?

344
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:21,201
Okay. Hmm, what is that?

345
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:30,845
I'll take these.

346
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:03,774
Uh, excuse.

347
00:23:03,815 --> 00:23:05,840
- Oh, yes sir.
- I have a...

348
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:09,183
how do you say?
Ticket for you to find something

349
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:12,190
- I... I would not lose.
- Oh, of course.

350
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:18,055
There you go.

351
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:20,121
This is it?

352
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:23,158
So you're Dutch?

353
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:25,192
Of course, yeah.

354
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,797
You have never heard
of Dutch chocolate?

355
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:32,338
Ricola!

356
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,613
Hold the door,
hold the door.

357
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:58,661
Klompen Dancers!

358
00:23:58,703 --> 00:24:01,171
Ladies and gentlemen,

359
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:04,664
the Klompen Dancers.

360
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:30,834
Oh-hh...

361
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:15,403
Shake it.

362
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:18,977
# Hey! #

363
00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:23,980
# Hey! #

364
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,819
- # Hey! #
- # Hey! #

365
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:28,118
# Hey! #

366
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:45,404
Hey!
You're great!

367
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,403
# Hey! #

368
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:56,285
# Hey! #

369
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:57,845
Klompen Dancers!

370
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:22,278
"Digital Arts
Research Technologies. "

371
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:24,612
Yes!

372
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:28,949
An address... "1221
Casshern Avenue. " Oh, yeah.

373
00:27:36,254 --> 00:27:37,915
What the...

374
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:42,518
It must be a message.

375
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:08,051
You giving me
a signal?

376
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:10,452
Maybe.

377
00:28:10,488 --> 00:28:12,115
Are you Hotbuns69?

378
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:14,057
What?

379
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:16,287
I'm Sweatyandready...

380
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:17,954
from the chat room.

381
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:21,363
Oh hell, no. No, you got
the wrong surfer, buddy.

382
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:24,266
Too bad.
Your loss, Mandingo.

383
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:26,770
- Weirdo.
- Hey, I work out.

384
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:29,365
Do you work out?
Go, Brown Sugar, dance it up!

385
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:55,656
Okay.

386
00:28:55,700 --> 00:29:00,034
A'ight... who am I?

387
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:06,402
I'm wealthy,
got a phat crib.

388
00:29:06,444 --> 00:29:09,140
Oh, yeah. Yeah yeah
yeah, got a hot wife...

389
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,011
hot hottie.

390
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:12,346
Diane.

391
00:29:12,383 --> 00:29:15,819
My underwear's too small.
I don't wear no pink thong.

392
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:18,015
I know I don't wear
a pink thong.

393
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:22,516
Love Skittles.

394
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,755
Especially
the green ones.

395
00:29:24,796 --> 00:29:28,197
I wonder what
that means.

396
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:30,997
Wow.

397
00:29:32,537 --> 00:29:33,799
# Well #

398
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:35,829
- # Who's that lady? #
- Hmm.

399
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:38,035
# Who's that lady? #

400
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:41,603
# Sexy lady,
who's that lady? #

401
00:29:41,646 --> 00:29:44,945
# Beautiful lady,
who's that lady? #

402
00:29:44,983 --> 00:29:48,680
# Real fine lady,
who's that lady? #

403
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,621
Hey hey hey!

404
00:29:51,656 --> 00:29:53,647
Damn, what is this, your first
day on the job?

405
00:29:53,691 --> 00:29:55,818
Oh, you wanna play?

406
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,090
Hey hey hey,
hey hey hey!

407
00:29:58,129 --> 00:29:59,687
You're making
the willy chilly.

408
00:29:59,731 --> 00:30:01,961
Why haven't you
called me?

409
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,231
Lady... miss,
ma'am...

410
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:09,331
- I have been busy.
- Oh, you have been busy?

411
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:11,137
Too damn busy
for your Boo?

412
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:13,644
Damn, I got
a Boo too?

413
00:30:13,678 --> 00:30:16,044
- Oh, you are gonna get it!
- That's... stop it.

414
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,843
Gina, stop!

415
00:30:17,882 --> 00:30:19,713
Oh, so now it's coming
back to you.

416
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:22,879
No, I just read your
name tag, crazy waitress lady.

417
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:24,013
What the hell is wrong
with you?

418
00:30:24,055 --> 00:30:26,319
You... attack all
your customers?

419
00:30:26,357 --> 00:30:28,723
Look, I've already
been traumatized.

420
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,990
What the hell
happened to your head?

421
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:34,021
Ehh... besides you
trying to smack me,

422
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:35,999
I... I got hit
with something.

423
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:37,433
Ow, ah, ah-hh.

424
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:38,696
Toast up, Gina.

425
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:43,596
- A'ight, I'll be right back.
- Yeah.

426
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:47,708
And...

427
00:30:47,745 --> 00:30:49,838
"fine ass girlfriend. "

428
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:54,613
Crazy, but fine.

429
00:31:05,129 --> 00:31:07,427
Hey, Gina,

430
00:31:07,465 --> 00:31:10,093
that building across the
street means something to me.

431
00:31:10,134 --> 00:31:12,068
That's where you do
your business, fool.

432
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:14,264
I do? Like,
is that my company?

433
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:17,706
- Your company.
- Yeah, like, do I own that place?

434
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:20,677
- Why are you messing with me?
- I'm not messing with you.

435
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:24,204
Otherwise, how would I know
that this place only has three exits?

436
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:27,218
Or that that woman eats a
short-stack of blueberry pancakes

437
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:29,413
every morning without syrup?
How would I know that?

438
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:31,820
That this guy drinks two cups of
coffee, then steals the sugar packets

439
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:33,824
when no one's looking?

440
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:37,659
Oscar, put the
Sweet'N Low down... now!

441
00:31:37,695 --> 00:31:39,890
Gina! Gina.
Look,

442
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:41,899
some strange stuff has
been happening to me.

443
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:43,958
There's only one
explanation... am I...?

444
00:31:44,002 --> 00:31:45,435
- A fool?
- No.

445
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:46,960
- Seriously!
- What...

446
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:50,031
Look, Gina,
am I a secret agent,

447
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:52,065
- you know, licensed to kill...
- Shh shh shh.

448
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,475
Shh.

449
00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:55,172
We shouldn't even be
talking about this.

450
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:59,149
Of course, I mean, this place
could be bugged. Sure.

451
00:31:59,183 --> 00:32:00,946
Go ahead,
tell me more.

452
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:03,146
- You're a killer.
- A killer...

453
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:06,281
like... like Green Beret,
Navy Seal, Army Ranger?

454
00:32:06,324 --> 00:32:07,951
No, you're in
a class by yourself.

455
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:10,756
- By myself.
- You've got a code name...

456
00:32:10,795 --> 00:32:12,854
"The Cleaner. "

457
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:14,797
The Cleaner.

458
00:32:14,832 --> 00:32:17,858
Listen, the government
calls you in to mop up.

459
00:32:17,902 --> 00:32:20,234
Okay, I see where
they going with this...

460
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:22,262
The Cleaner
mops up trouble.

461
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:27,006
Gina, how many men
have these hands killed?

462
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:29,479
Oh, they've taken out
a lot of trash.

463
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:31,641
Of course... keeping the world
safe from human debris.

464
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:34,709
- Destroyed millions of germs.
- Germ warfare.

465
00:32:34,752 --> 00:32:36,686
Cleaned countless
toilet seats!

466
00:32:36,721 --> 00:32:39,189
"Cleaned countless
toilet sea... "

467
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:42,021
- What?
- You're a janitor, dumbass.

468
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:45,029
- No.
- I don't have time for this.

469
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:47,190
No no no no,
I am special ops!

470
00:32:47,231 --> 00:32:49,131
Try special "mops. "

471
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:52,034
"Broom Raider"!
Let me break it down for you...

472
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:54,698
you're a janitor.
You work at Digital Arts.

473
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:58,702
Huh? Nah.

474
00:32:58,743 --> 00:33:00,404
No no no no no no.

475
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:01,912
- You had to see me yesterday.
- Check, please.

476
00:33:01,946 --> 00:33:03,846
- Oh, one second.
- I'm, like, flipping off balconies,

477
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:06,475
I cannonballed onto a truck
and landed like a cat.

478
00:33:07,952 --> 00:33:10,079
I was like James Bond
on Red Bull.

479
00:33:10,121 --> 00:33:13,887
Jake, you know people can do
incredible things when they're scared.

480
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:16,018
Scared? Who said anything
about being scared?

481
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:18,494
- Ain't nobody scared.
- Eggs still up, Gina!

482
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:19,655
Boo!

483
00:33:19,697 --> 00:33:22,222
Scramble this, Charlie.

484
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:25,360
There he is. I know the back
of that head any damn where.

485
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:27,564
Hey, and with
your church clothes on.

486
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:29,937
Where the hell
have you been, Jake?

487
00:33:29,974 --> 00:33:33,000
- I know you guys, right?
- Yeah, I'm your daddy.

488
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:34,705
Come on, Jake,
don't play dumb.

489
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:36,680
He not playing.
Look at his face.

490
00:33:36,714 --> 00:33:38,579
What's going on?
Y'all... y'all mad at me?

491
00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:40,584
I've been in shit water
all morning.

492
00:33:40,618 --> 00:33:43,815
- I'm mad at everybody!
- So I really am a janitor.

493
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:47,052
Yeah, you. But me,
I got bigger dreams.

494
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:49,889
I'm a rapper inside.
I'm about to explode.

495
00:33:49,927 --> 00:33:52,589
Come on, the "Clean
Dirty Doo"?

496
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:55,428
# It's all about doo-doo,
they're trying to flush me #

497
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:57,934
# I ain't diarrhea
so you can't rush me #

498
00:33:57,969 --> 00:34:00,961
# It's doo-doo! Listen to me closely,
wiping me like paper #

499
00:34:01,005 --> 00:34:02,939
# Can't throw me around,
can't flush me! #

500
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:04,942
Excuse me, guys.

501
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:08,412
# We're rolling money like toilet paper,
money like toilet paper, yeah... #

502
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:10,437
I went from ballin'
to not-at-all-in'.

503
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:12,949
- A couple of coffees here.
- Gina,

504
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:15,248
I feel like
I'm losing my mind.

505
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:17,948
Now, I think
you're my friend.

506
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:21,789
- Can you help me? Please?
- Sure.

507
00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:23,794
Show me where I live.

508
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:27,628
- Can we leave now?
- Okay.

509
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:30,065
Jake, I need you
for the video.

510
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:31,568
Jake?

511
00:34:57,829 --> 00:35:00,354
Good morning,
Digital Arts.

512
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:05,762
Good morning.

513
00:35:05,803 --> 00:35:08,863
- He's waiting for you, Diane.
- Thank you.

514
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:13,605
- What happened?
- I told you...

515
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:16,442
I took him to your house,
got him to trust me,

516
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:20,110
- but he didn't remember anything.
- You really believe that?

517
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:22,176
Yes, he believed
I was his wife.

518
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:25,656
So where do we stand?

519
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:28,818
We've got a janitor out there
that's breached our security

520
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:31,124
with company property
and has absolutely

521
00:35:31,162 --> 00:35:32,823
no memory
of any of it.

522
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:36,960
Really? A janitor is really
putting you through all this trouble.

523
00:35:38,002 --> 00:35:39,833
We have Jake's
place covered.

524
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:43,170
We're tracking Riley down and
we've issued a warrant for his arrest.

525
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:46,699
My buyers expect
the product by Monday.

526
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:48,541
I'm handling it.

527
00:35:54,018 --> 00:35:56,213
Here we are.

528
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:59,553
No! That's my crib?

529
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:01,114
You should've seen
where I lived yesterday.

530
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,923
It was on a whole
'nother level!

531
00:36:04,962 --> 00:36:07,260
Cops!

532
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:09,493
- I gotta take you somewhere familiar.
- Oh, I believe

533
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:11,729
I'm there right now.

534
00:36:14,272 --> 00:36:15,204
# I'll kill you
with my plunger #

535
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:16,900
# I'll pull your heart
with my plunger #

536
00:36:18,709 --> 00:36:20,336
# You ain't never
seen a plung... #

537
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:22,676
Oh-oh. Hey hey hey,
don't come in here now.

538
00:36:22,713 --> 00:36:24,112
I'm cleaning, okay?

539
00:36:24,148 --> 00:36:26,173
Oh, no, you look like
you gotta go bad.

540
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:27,707
Do not use
that last stall.

541
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:30,016
I need to talk
to you about uh...

542
00:36:30,054 --> 00:36:31,487
- Jake Rodgers.
- Oh, Jake?

543
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:33,046
- Yes.
- Jake is my man!

544
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:34,580
Yeah, we got big plans!

545
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:37,526
- What sort of plans?
- He's gonna manage me.

546
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:40,030
It's me, Ronnie, the Dirty
Clean Rapper... me.

547
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:41,793
It's a metaphor, see?
Can you feel me?

548
00:36:41,832 --> 00:36:43,231
Shut up!

549
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:46,361
Tell me about Jake Rodgers.
Is he really a janitor?

550
00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:49,339
Uh, not a good one. Otherwise
he'd be here now, right?

551
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:52,240
I wouldn't be here by myself,
cleaning up this whole bathroom.

552
00:36:52,276 --> 00:36:54,244
So he could be doing
something else?

553
00:36:54,278 --> 00:36:55,870
Right?

554
00:36:55,913 --> 00:36:58,438
We all could be doing
something on the side.

555
00:36:58,482 --> 00:37:00,450
On the side?

556
00:37:00,484 --> 00:37:02,509
You're asking a whole lot
of questions,

557
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:05,113
um... agent...

558
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:07,021
- Sir.
- Sir.

559
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:09,253
- Uh-huh.
- You want me to call you "sir" now?

560
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:11,420
Like "mass-sir,"
like I'm a slave?

561
00:37:11,462 --> 00:37:13,794
And even though I don't like
the way Jake cleans up around here,

562
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:15,458
I'm not a snitch
nor a rat...

563
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:16,864
either one of them
put together...

564
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:19,631
I'm not a snat or a rit!
Okay?

565
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:25,099
You done hit the wrong
janitor! Come on!

566
00:37:25,142 --> 00:37:27,110
Oh.

567
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:30,943
So you're gonna
shoot me?

568
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:32,313
I was thinking about it.

569
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:37,216
Shoot me.

570
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,223
Shoot me... you gonna
shoot me in the bathroom.

571
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:40,781
That's what I've
been waiting on.

572
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:43,794
This is my street credibility
right here! I ain't been shot yet!

573
00:37:43,828 --> 00:37:45,193
That's why I ain't
sellin' no albums!

574
00:37:45,229 --> 00:37:47,322
What was I thinking?
That's why I'm not sellin' no albums.

575
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:49,333
If I die, I'm Tupac.
If I live, I'm 50 Cent.

576
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:52,165
What if I end up somewhere
in the middle, like in a coma?

577
00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:54,899
Yeah! I can write all my rhymes
in a coma, just...

578
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,839
"beep... "
"How does he do it?"

579
00:37:56,874 --> 00:37:58,432
And writing to the beat
of the... "beep... "

580
00:37:58,476 --> 00:38:00,410
And every now and then
I can show a little struggle

581
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:02,002
and come out...
and go back in.

582
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:04,139
Oh, man, selling records
and laying down!

583
00:38:04,181 --> 00:38:06,274
Oh, shoot me, shoot me
in the shoulder.

584
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:08,308
Come on...
the top part.

585
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:11,253
No, shoot me in my side,
like right here.

586
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:12,950
Dude, like, shoot
a piece of fat off.

587
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:15,959
You know what I mean?
No, man, that'll hurt.

588
00:38:15,993 --> 00:38:19,190
I know... shoot me in my ass.

589
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,219
In my ass!

590
00:38:20,264 --> 00:38:22,425
'Cause that will be
like what the police do anyway...

591
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:24,957
shooting brothers in the backside.
And at the end of my concert

592
00:38:25,002 --> 00:38:27,232
I can pull my pants down
and show my ass

593
00:38:27,271 --> 00:38:29,068
like... "This is what y'all
did to me, America!"

594
00:38:29,106 --> 00:38:31,233
Shoot me in the ass!
Gotta be in the ass.

595
00:38:31,275 --> 00:38:33,140
Shoot me right there!
Give me another pocket!

596
00:38:33,177 --> 00:38:34,872
Put it in
my ass, come on!

597
00:38:34,912 --> 00:38:37,176
Come on! Shoot me
in the ass, come on!

598
00:38:37,214 --> 00:38:38,875
Shoot me in the ass,
right in the middle.

599
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:41,646
Come on, put it in my ass!
Put it in my ass!

600
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:43,551
Put it in my ass! I can take it...

601
00:38:43,587 --> 00:38:46,556
Put it in my ass! Put it in my ass!
Come on!

602
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:48,683
Right here, in the ass!

603
00:38:48,726 --> 00:38:50,353
You know, I...

604
00:38:50,394 --> 00:38:53,830
I don't even
know you anymore.

605
00:38:53,864 --> 00:38:55,855
Oh, damn.

606
00:39:10,414 --> 00:39:12,746
All right, here we are.

607
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:17,319
Damn, girl, you kind
of a slob, ain't you?

608
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,448
Are you always
on the job?

609
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:22,254
You've been having
a rummage sale?

610
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:23,885
You know you're too cute
to be living like this, right?

611
00:39:23,928 --> 00:39:25,088
Oh, this is
your cell phone.

612
00:39:25,129 --> 00:39:27,859
- This is my cell phone?
- Check the call log.

613
00:39:27,898 --> 00:39:29,092
Maybe it'll help you
remember something.

614
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:30,293
Good good good good.

615
00:39:30,334 --> 00:39:32,097
This will prove I know
what I'm talking about.

616
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:36,197
I'm sure all the numbers in here
are classified... CIA, everything.

617
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,435
All right, recent calls, here we go...

618
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:41,604
Papa John's,
Papa John's,

619
00:39:41,645 --> 00:39:45,979
Quiznos,
El Pollo Loco,

620
00:39:46,016 --> 00:39:49,247
uh...
Crazy Chicken.

621
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:52,414
Spies gotta eat,
right?

622
00:39:52,456 --> 00:39:56,324
Right. This is your
work shirt. Explain this.

623
00:39:58,262 --> 00:40:02,062
Yeah. You know, it is obvious
that I'm undercover as a janitor.

624
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:04,829
- Undercover?
- Look,

625
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:07,997
you are a waitress,
all right?

626
00:40:08,038 --> 00:40:10,063
So this may be
over your head,

627
00:40:10,107 --> 00:40:13,907
but is there's some serious,
serious super-spy stuff going on here.

628
00:40:13,944 --> 00:40:17,107
- This is what I do!
- Okay, super-spy,

629
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:20,174
- let's take a look at this.
- Ow!

630
00:40:20,217 --> 00:40:22,777
Such a baby.

631
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,788
You know...

632
00:40:24,822 --> 00:40:27,450
you really could use
a janitor in your life.

633
00:40:27,491 --> 00:40:30,483
Look at this mess...

634
00:40:34,064 --> 00:40:35,395
Oh, man.

635
00:40:40,404 --> 00:40:41,803
Riley gave you those.

636
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:46,467
- Who's Riley?
- You don't remember your friend Riley?

637
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:48,535
He's an exec
at Digital Arts.

638
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:50,547
Well why would he give me
these games?

639
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:52,947
You're a freak
for video games, Jake.

640
00:40:52,983 --> 00:40:54,974
Digital Arts manufactures them.

641
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:57,419
You even gave Riley ideas on
how to make them better.

642
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,548
- I did?
- Mm-hmm.

643
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:01,217
Hmm.

644
00:41:01,258 --> 00:41:02,919
You came in here a few
days ago in a big hurry.

645
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,587
You said it wasn't safe
to go back to your place.

646
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:06,619
You said a whole lot of stuff
is gonna make sense to me soon.

647
00:41:06,664 --> 00:41:08,325
- Do you remember any of this?
- Ack!

648
00:41:08,365 --> 00:41:10,560
Sorry.

649
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:13,502
I remember alcohol stings
like a bitch. Damn!

650
00:41:13,537 --> 00:41:16,301
You said, "We're gonna get away for
the weekend, maybe go on a vacation,"

651
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,808
- remember?
- You and I?

652
00:41:18,843 --> 00:41:21,004
Where... where, like,
like the Bahamas?

653
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:23,707
I can see that...
a couple of mai tais,

654
00:41:23,747 --> 00:41:27,183
- maybe a little coconut oil.
- Mm-hmm.

655
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:30,610
Hey, Gina,

656
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:33,452
how long have I been
uh, you know,

657
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:36,324
- hittin' it?
- "Hittin' it"?

658
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,590
Trust me, you ain't
hit nothing yet.

659
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:40,756
You would remember
hittin' Mama.

660
00:41:40,798 --> 00:41:42,959
- What kind of girl you think I am?
- Well, damn,

661
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,401
if I could remember what kind
of woman you are, I would remember

662
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:48,962
what kind of man I am. Then I would
know why my clothes are over here

663
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:50,234
and I ain't hittin' it.

664
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:52,208
Hey, you have left your
super-spy watch on the sink.

665
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:54,108
Hey hey hey,
don't touch that.

666
00:41:54,144 --> 00:41:55,873
This is government-issued,
I'm sure.

667
00:41:55,913 --> 00:41:59,349
You push the wrong button
on this thing and boom!

668
00:41:59,383 --> 00:42:01,248
Pah! Goodbye,
New Guinea.

669
00:42:01,285 --> 00:42:04,254
You know, Jake, I've got a bad feeling...
I think we need to get out of here.

670
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:10,620
- Hey, Gina?
- Mm-hmm?

671
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:14,188
This may not be a good time
to bring this up because, uh,

672
00:42:14,231 --> 00:42:16,631
well, it involves
another woman.

673
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:18,965
Another what?

674
00:42:19,003 --> 00:42:21,733
- Another woman.
- Oh, I heard you!

675
00:42:21,772 --> 00:42:23,763
What about
this other woman?

676
00:42:23,807 --> 00:42:26,275
Okay, all right, she told
me her name was Diane.

677
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:28,608
The "who-what-and-why"
of Diane right now!

678
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:30,910
Well, I met her at the hotel
yesterday and then she took me

679
00:42:30,948 --> 00:42:32,939
- to this big-ass estate.
- Mm-hmm.

680
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:36,441
And then she had
a doctor check me out.

681
00:42:36,487 --> 00:42:37,920
That's it?

682
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:41,917
- Then her clothes came off.
- What?

683
00:42:41,959 --> 00:42:44,325
- I'm gonna smack you.
- Would...

684
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:45,692
Would you stop... hold on
just a second, okay?

685
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:48,823
It wasn't like she was naked, okay?
She had on some lingerie.

686
00:42:48,866 --> 00:42:50,925
- Ah...
- you know? Little cool,

687
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:54,426
little pink thing, you know,
with the glittery lotion, you know?

688
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:57,932
Damn it.

689
00:42:57,975 --> 00:43:00,910
It wasn't like
it was dirty.

690
00:43:00,945 --> 00:43:02,310
She was my wife!

691
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:04,644
Your wife?
She was your wife?

692
00:43:04,682 --> 00:43:07,480
Okay, quit it with
the haymakers.

693
00:43:07,518 --> 00:43:08,917
Thank you.

694
00:43:08,953 --> 00:43:10,818
- Hmm.
- That's what she told me, all right?

695
00:43:10,854 --> 00:43:13,379
I didn't believe her, though,
because in my subconscious mind

696
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:16,655
there was a voice saying, "Jake,
don't do this, man.

697
00:43:16,694 --> 00:43:19,686
There's somebody out there
that loves you more than your wife. "

698
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:24,190
- You expect me to believe that?
- Yeah.

699
00:43:24,234 --> 00:43:28,000
You know she tried to kill me,
right?

700
00:43:30,674 --> 00:43:34,235
- Come on.
- Shit!

701
00:43:36,246 --> 00:43:38,680
Roger that.

702
00:43:51,228 --> 00:43:53,696
No luck duplicating
the chip?

703
00:43:53,731 --> 00:43:55,892
Not by Monday.

704
00:43:57,234 --> 00:43:59,794
Know what I've got
in my hand? Security footage

705
00:43:59,837 --> 00:44:02,704
showing Jake Rodgers leaving
the Pacific Crest Hotel.

706
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:05,300
And you know who else
is on it?

707
00:44:05,342 --> 00:44:08,709
You're just lucky that I got
this before any other agent saw it.

708
00:44:08,746 --> 00:44:10,475
You're lucky
you're still here.

709
00:44:10,514 --> 00:44:11,879
Hey, I'm not
your employee.

710
00:44:11,915 --> 00:44:15,976
I'm not your head of security
that you're dating on the side.

711
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,851
You get the chip,
I set up the buyers

712
00:44:17,888 --> 00:44:19,913
and I keep the rest of
the FBI off your case.

713
00:44:19,957 --> 00:44:22,289
So far, I've kept
my end of the deal.

714
00:44:24,695 --> 00:44:27,664
A janitor can't outrun
a citywide manhunt.

715
00:44:27,698 --> 00:44:30,030
What if he's not?

716
00:44:30,067 --> 00:44:31,830
Not what?

717
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:33,666
A janitor? What if he's
not just a janitor?

718
00:44:33,704 --> 00:44:35,501
What if he's an
undercover agent?

719
00:44:35,539 --> 00:44:37,598
You said you knew all of the FBI
assigned to this case.

720
00:44:37,641 --> 00:44:40,132
If he's not CIA, NSA,
or Military Intelligence,

721
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:41,769
they're not gonna tell us
they're on our turf.

722
00:44:41,812 --> 00:44:44,178
They're gonna want that
bust for themselves, right?

723
00:44:44,214 --> 00:44:46,205
- You're serious?
- Yeah, it happens all the time.

724
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:49,549
- Parallel investigations.
- I questioned him up close, okay?

725
00:44:49,586 --> 00:44:52,987
There's no way
this guy is faking.

726
00:44:54,458 --> 00:44:56,983
Maybe he played you.

727
00:44:58,328 --> 00:45:01,957
Or he is hurt... did lose his memory,
but he's running on instinct.

728
00:45:01,999 --> 00:45:06,402
What better cover to infiltrate
your company than a janitor?

729
00:45:06,437 --> 00:45:10,237
Janitors go anywhere, everywhere,
nobody pays any attention to them.

730
00:45:10,274 --> 00:45:12,208
They're hired help.

731
00:45:12,242 --> 00:45:15,370
They are the only people who have
key cards to every room in the building.

732
00:45:15,412 --> 00:45:17,277
Total access.

733
00:45:17,314 --> 00:45:21,216
Janitors work after hours, after
everyone else has gone home.

734
00:45:21,251 --> 00:45:24,015
If I was looking
for the perfect cover,

735
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:25,487
that'd be it.

736
00:45:29,493 --> 00:45:31,654
He started work here
a year and a half ago.

737
00:45:31,695 --> 00:45:34,721
That's when we started
developing the X-1 chip.

738
00:45:34,765 --> 00:45:36,960
No, it's coincidence.

739
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,093
A lot of
coincidences.

740
00:45:39,136 --> 00:45:41,764
A spy pretending
he is a janitor

741
00:45:41,805 --> 00:45:44,171
or a spy who thinks
he's a janitor,

742
00:45:44,208 --> 00:45:47,609
either way he's a lot more
dangerous than we ever anticipated.

743
00:45:47,644 --> 00:45:50,807
It doesn't matter.
I want the chip,

744
00:45:50,848 --> 00:45:52,577
then I want him dead.

745
00:45:53,951 --> 00:45:57,443
Yes.
Where?

746
00:45:57,488 --> 00:45:59,752
Stay on him.

747
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:02,122
A lead on Riley.

748
00:46:22,479 --> 00:46:23,946
Shut up, you idiot!

749
00:46:23,981 --> 00:46:26,643
- Did you get him?
- Hey,

750
00:46:26,683 --> 00:46:29,174
I'm just trying to make
sure things are tight...

751
00:46:29,219 --> 00:46:32,211
protecting you,
show you some love.

752
00:46:32,256 --> 00:46:34,520
That's what I do.

753
00:46:35,926 --> 00:46:40,625
And I'm, uh, also good
at a few other things.

754
00:46:40,664 --> 00:46:43,997
Oh, hell no. You
are still in cheaters' jail.

755
00:46:44,034 --> 00:46:46,127
Look, you need to tell me
what's going on here.

756
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:48,536
All right.

757
00:46:48,572 --> 00:46:51,063
All right,
all right, all right.

758
00:46:51,108 --> 00:46:54,043
I found this briefcase
at the hotel yesterday.

759
00:46:54,077 --> 00:46:56,136
- It's full of money.
- How much money?

760
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:59,240
Well, minus a double
mochaccino,

761
00:46:59,283 --> 00:47:00,716
and a couple
of lottery tickets...

762
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:03,379
about $250,000.

763
00:47:05,088 --> 00:47:07,147
Oh my, dog,
you nicked this cash

764
00:47:07,191 --> 00:47:09,523
for a mochaccino and
a couple of Quick Picks?

765
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:13,360
Eh... still think
I'm a janitor?

766
00:47:15,699 --> 00:47:19,191
Look, Diane mentioned
something about a computer chip.

767
00:47:19,236 --> 00:47:21,033
And I think they
think I have it.

768
00:47:21,071 --> 00:47:22,698
Maybe that's what
they want.

769
00:47:22,739 --> 00:47:24,866
Well, if they want it,
they can have it!

770
00:47:24,908 --> 00:47:27,741
I just don't wanna end up
like the dead guy at the hotel.

771
00:47:27,778 --> 00:47:29,439
Dead guy?

772
00:47:29,479 --> 00:47:31,970
You didn't mention anything
to me about a dead guy.

773
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:35,576
It's not the best icebreaker...
"How you doing, Miss Waitress Lady?

774
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:38,087
I just woke up
next to a dead FBI agent.

775
00:47:38,121 --> 00:47:40,521
- What's your special?
- FBI?

776
00:47:40,557 --> 00:47:42,889
Jake, this is serious.
You're in a lot of trouble.

777
00:47:42,926 --> 00:47:45,451
- You need to tell me everything.
- That's it.

778
00:47:45,495 --> 00:47:48,259
I mean, that's
all I know.

779
00:47:48,298 --> 00:47:52,894
We need to get you back to your
place... that'll help you remember.

780
00:47:52,936 --> 00:47:54,767
I'm gonna change.

781
00:47:54,805 --> 00:47:57,296
I'll be right back.

782
00:48:15,192 --> 00:48:17,251
Who is Riley?

783
00:48:18,962 --> 00:48:21,760
Diane...

784
00:48:21,798 --> 00:48:24,995
freaking wife!
Gina...

785
00:48:27,204 --> 00:48:30,264
fine-ass girlfriend
saying I ain't hit it.

786
00:48:30,307 --> 00:48:32,298
Question mark.

787
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:35,942
Computer chip.

788
00:48:37,447 --> 00:48:41,281
Digital Arts,
Digital Arts...

789
00:48:45,722 --> 00:48:48,748
Quiznos, Quiznos...

790
00:48:48,792 --> 00:48:50,851
must be a code...

791
00:48:56,533 --> 00:49:00,469
Be careful of The Rat.
We're in his territory now.

792
00:49:11,148 --> 00:49:13,378
Prepare to die,
Colonel Bowman.

793
00:49:19,256 --> 00:49:21,247
This ain't
what you want!

794
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:28,994
Yeah.

795
00:49:29,032 --> 00:49:31,023
Gina,

796
00:49:31,068 --> 00:49:32,865
- I remembered something.
- What?

797
00:49:32,903 --> 00:49:35,531
I am definitely
not a janitor.

798
00:49:35,572 --> 00:49:38,006
I'm some kind of bad-ass
Special Forces,

799
00:49:38,041 --> 00:49:40,908
like...
like Black Rambo.

800
00:49:40,944 --> 00:49:43,276
Okay, "Blambo",
what else?

801
00:49:44,348 --> 00:49:46,179
I'm a colonel.

802
00:49:51,388 --> 00:49:53,856
- Hello?
- Where have you been?

803
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:55,881
- Who's this?
- It's Riley.

804
00:49:55,926 --> 00:49:58,053
- Who do you think it is?
- Riley?

805
00:49:58,095 --> 00:50:01,895
Listen, you were right about
everything. Don't trust anyone.

806
00:50:01,932 --> 00:50:03,797
You meet me at the airport
as fast as you can,

807
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:06,064
SEATAC terminal number one
and come alone.

808
00:50:08,472 --> 00:50:10,303
Janitor, my ass.

809
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:13,241
- Who was that?
- Get your stuff, let's go.

810
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:36,697
Okay, now he thinks I'm coming
alone so I need you to sit tight.

811
00:50:36,733 --> 00:50:40,669
- But I wanna help.
- You wanna help, you...

812
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:44,105
look, I don't know how
to say this. Gina,

813
00:50:44,141 --> 00:50:46,609
you're just a waitress,
I'm the agent.

814
00:50:46,643 --> 00:50:49,237
If I wanna know what
the soup of the day is, I'll ask you.

815
00:50:50,247 --> 00:50:51,839
But until then I need
you to sit in the car

816
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:54,112
and just wait for me, okay?
It's dangerous in there.

817
00:50:54,151 --> 00:50:56,813
- But, Boo...
- No no no. No no no no.

818
00:50:56,853 --> 00:50:58,684
Don't "but Boo" me
right now.

819
00:51:00,524 --> 00:51:03,152
Stay in your lane,
okay?

820
00:51:04,194 --> 00:51:06,321
Oh.

821
00:51:06,363 --> 00:51:08,228
...your baggage
unattended.

822
00:51:08,265 --> 00:51:12,326
All your personal items must
remain with you at all times.

823
00:51:18,809 --> 00:51:20,936
This is the last call
for boarding

824
00:51:20,977 --> 00:51:25,073
for flight #486, nonstop
service from Seattle to Phoenix...

825
00:51:25,115 --> 00:51:27,447
- Hey, Jake.
- Hey.

826
00:51:27,484 --> 00:51:30,146
- Hey.
- You're Riley, right?

827
00:51:30,187 --> 00:51:33,020
Of course.
What is wrong with you?

828
00:51:33,056 --> 00:51:36,958
- I got hit in the head.
- Where's the X-1, Jake?

829
00:51:36,993 --> 00:51:39,484
- The computer chip?
- Yes yes. Where is it?

830
00:51:39,529 --> 00:51:41,759
Everybody is looking
for this thing.

831
00:51:41,798 --> 00:51:44,926
So that's why
I was at the hotel?

832
00:51:44,968 --> 00:51:47,163
- You aren't kidding, are you?
- No.

833
00:51:47,204 --> 00:51:49,729
- I can't remember shit.
- You went to talk to the Bureau.

834
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:53,174
You went to meet with the FBl...
you remember that?

835
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:55,508
I promise, man.
I, I-I, I don't know.

836
00:51:55,545 --> 00:51:58,639
The last thing that you said was
that you were headed to Boca Raton.

837
00:51:59,649 --> 00:52:01,514
Go! Go go go.

838
00:52:07,557 --> 00:52:08,854
Hi, honey.

839
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:11,020
- Move it.
- Don't do it. Stop.

840
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:13,222
Let's go.

841
00:52:13,263 --> 00:52:15,288
Get your hands off.

842
00:52:15,332 --> 00:52:18,392
- Hi, baby. I tried to call you.
- In the car.

843
00:52:18,435 --> 00:52:20,369
L... put...
uh, hey... stop!

844
00:52:20,403 --> 00:52:21,461
Get your hands off me.

845
00:52:21,505 --> 00:52:23,063
- Look, this ain't what you want...
- Get in!

846
00:52:46,696 --> 00:52:48,789
Hey hey...

847
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:50,663
- you don't have to push me.
- Move.

848
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:53,567
- Hey hey hey. Come on, man.
- Jake,

849
00:52:53,603 --> 00:52:56,470
you might not believe this,
but I'm here to help you.

850
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:59,373
I'm telling you, this is
your last chance.

851
00:52:59,409 --> 00:53:02,037
Obviously, our marriage
is not based

852
00:53:02,078 --> 00:53:04,046
on trust and
communication.

853
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:06,344
Jake, we're not
really married.

854
00:53:06,383 --> 00:53:07,680
What?

855
00:53:07,717 --> 00:53:10,880
- No.
- Look, you took something.

856
00:53:10,921 --> 00:53:13,913
Give it to me or I can't
help you anymore.

857
00:53:13,957 --> 00:53:17,256
You call this help?
You call this help?

858
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:23,359
Who are you supposed
to be, more help?

859
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,459
You don't
recognize me?

860
00:53:25,502 --> 00:53:28,062
- You don't know who I am?
- Hell, no.

861
00:53:28,104 --> 00:53:30,231
He still doesn't
remember anything.

862
00:53:30,273 --> 00:53:32,571
Or maybe his memory is
back and he's just faking it.

863
00:53:32,609 --> 00:53:36,136
No way you can bullshit
5cc of sodium pentothal.

864
00:53:36,179 --> 00:53:37,168
Stick him.

865
00:53:38,348 --> 00:53:41,146
Oh, ooh-ooh.
No no no no.

866
00:53:43,653 --> 00:53:45,587
Come on and get it.

867
00:53:47,624 --> 00:53:50,320
Aye, you got me.

868
00:53:51,528 --> 00:53:53,928
This drug is only
effective for a few moments.

869
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:57,764
Start to question him.

870
00:53:57,801 --> 00:54:00,292
Jake? Jake!

871
00:54:00,337 --> 00:54:02,669
Whoo-whoo.

872
00:54:02,706 --> 00:54:04,606
Where did you hide
the chip?

873
00:54:04,641 --> 00:54:09,010
Oh, I hid the chip in...
in my treasure chest,

874
00:54:09,045 --> 00:54:13,539
under the castle,
with my pet dragon, Gus.

875
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:15,949
You'll like Gus.
He breathes fire.

876
00:54:15,986 --> 00:54:18,955
You gotta
be more specific.

877
00:54:18,989 --> 00:54:20,820
- Hello.
- Now Jake,

878
00:54:20,857 --> 00:54:22,984
you got a secret and you're
gonna feel a whole lot better

879
00:54:23,026 --> 00:54:26,018
if you just give it up and just tell us
what we wanna know. Come on.

880
00:54:26,062 --> 00:54:27,529
I have a secret?

881
00:54:27,564 --> 00:54:29,759
I know I have
a secret, I...

882
00:54:29,799 --> 00:54:33,496
I admit it, I admit it.
But you gotta admit it too.

883
00:54:33,536 --> 00:54:35,367
Martha Stewart's hot.

884
00:54:35,405 --> 00:54:37,703
- She's hot.
- We don't wanna hear this, Jake!

885
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:40,266
I don't wanna hear this!
I want the truth!

886
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:42,676
Just tell me
the truth!

887
00:54:42,712 --> 00:54:45,545
Whoo, the truth is...

888
00:54:45,582 --> 00:54:47,812
your breath smells like ass.

889
00:54:47,851 --> 00:54:52,481
Whew!
Funky time!

890
00:54:58,995 --> 00:55:01,987
Okay, that's it.
Shut him up.

891
00:55:05,702 --> 00:55:08,500
What the hell is that?

892
00:55:08,538 --> 00:55:12,440
He's having a reaction to the drug.
You gave him too much.

893
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:18,079
Hey!

894
00:55:18,114 --> 00:55:19,979
Don't!
Don't kill him.

895
00:55:20,016 --> 00:55:22,780
- What are you looking at? Go get him!
- Run!

896
00:55:40,036 --> 00:55:42,300
- Yeah yeah.
- This way.

897
00:55:45,208 --> 00:55:47,802
- Boy, am I glad to see you!
- Are you all right?

898
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:49,539
- Yeah.
- Hang on.

899
00:55:56,419 --> 00:55:57,886
Sweet Jesus!

900
00:55:59,923 --> 00:56:01,618
Damn, they're shooting.

901
00:56:12,936 --> 00:56:16,133
Get d... get out!

902
00:56:16,172 --> 00:56:17,901
Grab the wheel!

903
00:56:17,941 --> 00:56:19,431
Hyah!

904
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:23,273
Hey hey hey.

905
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:32,053
Damn, girl!

906
00:56:34,758 --> 00:56:36,783
You got skills.

907
00:56:47,937 --> 00:56:49,768
So I take it you're not
just a waitress?

908
00:56:49,806 --> 00:56:51,296
I'm a federal agent, Jake.

909
00:56:51,341 --> 00:56:53,070
Federal agent?
Why didn't you tell me?

910
00:56:53,109 --> 00:56:55,100
You're on a strictly
need-to-know basis...

911
00:56:55,145 --> 00:56:57,409
like the soup of
the day, super-spy.

912
00:56:57,447 --> 00:56:59,312
Okay.

913
00:56:59,349 --> 00:57:01,909
The man that shot at you back there,
his name is Richard Shaw.

914
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:03,851
So wait... wait,
you know him?

915
00:57:03,887 --> 00:57:07,823
Yes, unfortunately
he's with the FBI too.

916
00:57:07,857 --> 00:57:10,985
- Crane here.
- Martin, we have a situation here.

917
00:57:11,027 --> 00:57:15,521
Uh-huh. I just had a very
disturbing conversation with Shaw.

918
00:57:15,565 --> 00:57:17,396
Now, you need to turn yourself
in immediately.

919
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:19,402
You don't understand.
Shaw has turned.

920
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:21,131
That's exactly what
he said about you.

921
00:57:21,171 --> 00:57:24,163
Just tell me exactly where you are.
We'll straighten this whole thing out.

922
00:57:24,207 --> 00:57:27,108
- I can't do that, Martin.
- Gina?

923
00:57:27,143 --> 00:57:28,371
Gina!

924
00:57:28,411 --> 00:57:30,311
Shaw got to Crane.
We're on our own.

925
00:57:30,346 --> 00:57:32,541
Whoa whoa whoa, what does
this mean, "We're on our own"?

926
00:57:32,582 --> 00:57:34,777
- I've been working undercover, Jake.
- Damn.

927
00:57:34,818 --> 00:57:37,981
We discovered that by altering the
encoded chip in the X-1 video game,

928
00:57:38,021 --> 00:57:40,182
classified information can be
transferred undetected.

929
00:57:40,223 --> 00:57:44,683
Damn! Espionage.
That's what it is.

930
00:57:44,727 --> 00:57:47,491
Someone at Digital Arts wants to
sell the chip on the black market.

931
00:57:47,530 --> 00:57:49,157
You get the picture.
I was assigned to you.

932
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:51,531
You were assigned to me? For what?
Why would you be assigned to me?

933
00:57:51,568 --> 00:57:53,968
- Because you have the chip, Jake!
- I have the chip.

934
00:57:54,003 --> 00:57:55,994
I have the chip.

935
00:57:56,039 --> 00:57:58,303
- Riley, did you check out the chip?
- Yeah, I checked it out.

936
00:57:58,341 --> 00:57:59,808
You were right, Jake...

937
00:57:59,843 --> 00:58:01,708
the processor chip for
our new gaming console, the X-1,

938
00:58:01,744 --> 00:58:04,736
it's got another chip
engraved inside its circuitry.

939
00:58:04,781 --> 00:58:07,147
Somebody's been
developing a spy chip

940
00:58:07,183 --> 00:58:09,242
using our gaming
research as a cover.

941
00:58:09,285 --> 00:58:12,345
You just change around a couple
of polarities, you go from video games

942
00:58:12,388 --> 00:58:14,822
to making unbreakable
codes, you understand?

943
00:58:14,858 --> 00:58:18,350
The CIA, NSA... nobody
could break these encryptions.

944
00:58:18,394 --> 00:58:20,385
So if somebody can get
ahold of this thing...

945
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:22,364
they could smuggle in
anything, plan an attack,

946
00:58:22,398 --> 00:58:24,025
and we couldn't even
track 'em down!

947
00:58:24,067 --> 00:58:27,298
We gotta stop 'em, Jake.

948
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:33,632
Of course. Of course
I have the chip.

949
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:36,042
That's what this operation
is all about!

950
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:39,048
And you must be a support-level
agent assigned to assist me

951
00:58:39,082 --> 00:58:40,709
in this thing.

952
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:44,413
Also, I guess it's a good
time to tell you, Gina...

953
00:58:44,454 --> 00:58:47,082
My real name is Colonel Bowman.
Welcome aboard.

954
00:58:47,123 --> 00:58:49,921
I got some bad news
for you, Colonel.

955
00:58:51,828 --> 00:58:53,921
I'm running errands
for you now?

956
00:58:53,963 --> 00:58:56,898
What do you need, a PowerBook,
an AC adaptor or something?

957
00:58:56,933 --> 00:58:58,730
You're not
gonna like this.

958
00:59:00,069 --> 00:59:02,594
Here's your
Colonel Bowman.

959
00:59:03,606 --> 00:59:06,268
It's your favorite game.

960
00:59:06,309 --> 00:59:08,641
Okay okay, so maybe
I got the name wrong,

961
00:59:08,678 --> 00:59:11,374
but explain
these skills, huh?

962
00:59:14,417 --> 00:59:17,284
You learned the moves from
the video game, Jake.

963
00:59:21,925 --> 00:59:23,984
It's just
coincidence.

964
00:59:24,027 --> 00:59:27,326
- Be careful of The Rat.
- I mean that don't prove nothing, Gina.

965
00:59:27,363 --> 00:59:29,888
- This ain't what you want.
- Okay? I'm a master!

966
00:59:29,933 --> 00:59:32,333
It takes years of training
to do what I do.

967
00:59:32,368 --> 00:59:35,303
Jake, you leave me
no choice.

968
00:59:35,338 --> 00:59:38,171
We had you
under surveillance.

969
00:59:38,207 --> 00:59:40,801
Wait, what?

970
00:59:40,843 --> 00:59:44,074
Y'all were looking in my house?
That ain't right.

971
00:59:44,113 --> 00:59:46,980
We caught you in one of your
training sessions.

972
00:59:47,016 --> 00:59:49,644
You were spying on
a spy? Damn!

973
00:59:49,686 --> 00:59:51,176
Oh, it gets worse.

974
00:59:55,792 --> 00:59:57,089
Okay, will you
turn that off?

975
00:59:57,126 --> 00:59:58,787
Not pretty.

976
00:59:58,828 --> 01:00:02,025
Ha-aa, this ain't
what you want.

977
01:00:02,065 --> 01:00:03,930
Turn the thing off.
Turn it off.

978
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:06,231
- Turn... turn this thing off.
- Okay, okay.

979
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:07,566
Let's go.

980
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:08,866
All right, but we're
going back your place.

981
01:00:08,905 --> 01:00:11,066
Prepare to die,
Colonel Bowman.

982
01:00:39,268 --> 01:00:41,736
Wow, what a dump!

983
01:00:41,771 --> 01:00:43,739
This is your place.
Does it look familiar?

984
01:00:43,773 --> 01:00:45,764
This my place?

985
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:48,333
Huh? No.

986
01:00:48,378 --> 01:00:50,278
Hey, Gina.

987
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:55,175
Since you're really FBI, I guess
you never really were my Boo, huh?

988
01:00:55,218 --> 01:00:57,812
Sorry.

989
01:00:57,854 --> 01:01:00,482
Hmm, you acting jealous,

990
01:01:00,523 --> 01:01:02,548
you... you were just
faking that too, right?

991
01:01:02,592 --> 01:01:06,426
Jake, let's just say you made
it easy for me to keep my cover.

992
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:10,026
Another place,
another time.

993
01:01:10,066 --> 01:01:11,431
Hey, you never know.

994
01:01:12,635 --> 01:01:15,570
- Did I treat you right?
- Always.

995
01:01:15,605 --> 01:01:18,904
# Am I the lover
that I think I am? #

996
01:01:19,909 --> 01:01:22,377
You're sweet.
You make me laugh.

997
01:01:22,412 --> 01:01:26,007
- And we love to eat together.
- I took you ice-skating?

998
01:01:26,049 --> 01:01:28,347
Yeah, you're
pretty romantic.

999
01:01:28,384 --> 01:01:31,353
Look how cute you are
in those tights.

1000
01:01:31,387 --> 01:01:34,220
Yeah, but I couldn't get
a extra large?

1001
01:01:34,257 --> 01:01:37,624
- Hey, you've got messages.
- Yeah?

1002
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:40,185
Hey, Jake, it's Steve,
from Quiznos. Bad news...

1003
01:01:40,229 --> 01:01:42,129
someone jacked our bread truck.
No worries, bro.

1004
01:01:42,165 --> 01:01:45,066
Your sandwich will be delivered
as usual. Just how you like 'em...

1005
01:01:45,101 --> 01:01:46,466
triple oven-baked...

1006
01:01:46,502 --> 01:01:48,902
"Spies gotta eat. "

1007
01:01:48,938 --> 01:01:51,202
That's
what I'm saying.

1008
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:53,834
- That's what I'm saying.
- Jake, it's Riley.

1009
01:01:53,876 --> 01:01:55,776
Sector Seven
is just not working yet.

1010
01:01:55,812 --> 01:01:58,645
You can't kill the man in the
black coat before the eagle strikes.

1011
01:01:58,681 --> 01:02:01,582
I need more help with this. I hope your
friends at the agency don't mind.

1012
01:02:01,617 --> 01:02:03,676
You see? You see, that's
what I'm talking about.

1013
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,620
That's some real
spy talk right there.

1014
01:02:05,655 --> 01:02:07,589
- I knew it, I knew it.
- It's Riley.

1015
01:02:07,623 --> 01:02:08,749
- Mm-hmm.
- You're right.

1016
01:02:08,791 --> 01:02:09,917
Hauck must be in on this.

1017
01:02:09,959 --> 01:02:13,451
When you meet the FBI,
remember: No names, no IDs.

1018
01:02:13,496 --> 01:02:16,954
Only contact me on my cell.
You gotta come through on this.

1019
01:02:16,999 --> 01:02:19,832
From here on out
you're "The Cleaner. "

1020
01:02:21,137 --> 01:02:24,265
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah, I did, actually.

1021
01:02:24,307 --> 01:02:27,071
I'm "The Cleaner,"
I'm "The Cleaner"!

1022
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:30,978
I knew it!
I told you!

1023
01:02:31,013 --> 01:02:32,844
It's Riley again.
Did you leave town?

1024
01:02:32,882 --> 01:02:35,680
You mentioned Boca Raton.
Where are you, Jake?

1025
01:02:35,718 --> 01:02:38,949
- Boca Raton?
- Were you planning a trip there?

1026
01:02:38,988 --> 01:02:41,548
No! No.

1027
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:45,152
Boca Raton is a city
north of Miami in Florida.

1028
01:02:45,194 --> 01:02:46,923
Nothing.

1029
01:02:46,963 --> 01:02:48,988
Boca Raton...
"the mouth of the rat. "

1030
01:02:49,031 --> 01:02:52,967
- Huh?
- Spanish for "mouth of the rat. "

1031
01:02:53,002 --> 01:02:55,766
"Mouth of the rat. "

1032
01:02:55,805 --> 01:02:57,773
Mouth of The Rat...
yes!

1033
01:02:57,807 --> 01:03:00,605
- I know where the chip is!
- You know where the chip is?

1034
01:03:00,643 --> 01:03:02,508
That's what I'm saying.

1035
01:03:02,545 --> 01:03:05,309
- You're sure?
- Yes, yes! I'm positive! Come on!

1036
01:03:18,561 --> 01:03:20,529
- What?
- Would you put th...

1037
01:03:20,563 --> 01:03:22,087
- bac... those are mine!
- Stop it!

1038
01:03:22,131 --> 01:03:23,621
Look, I don't wanna be noticed.

1039
01:03:23,666 --> 01:03:27,033
Well, I guarantee you're gonna
get noticed in that getup.

1040
01:03:27,069 --> 01:03:29,663
Look, would you
put those back?

1041
01:03:29,705 --> 01:03:31,400
The plan is we get in,
we get out. It's simple.

1042
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:32,930
Maybe you're right.

1043
01:03:32,975 --> 01:03:36,240
I mean it is after hours.
Nobody'll recognize me.

1044
01:03:48,357 --> 01:03:51,349
Hey, can you open
the gate?

1045
01:03:51,394 --> 01:03:54,329
Well, if it isn't
Mr. Jake Rodgers.

1046
01:03:54,363 --> 01:03:56,024
You know everybody
is looking for you?

1047
01:03:56,065 --> 01:03:59,694
I could get $75 for turning you in.
What's going on?

1048
01:03:59,735 --> 01:04:03,102
I know, baby, okay? But right
now, I need you to let me in.

1049
01:04:03,139 --> 01:04:06,540
Baby, I know you didn't
just call me "baby"!

1050
01:04:06,576 --> 01:04:09,841
How about calling me "Jacuzzi"?
How about that, Jake?

1051
01:04:09,879 --> 01:04:11,779
Why would
I call you that?

1052
01:04:11,814 --> 01:04:14,214
'Cause it's my name.

1053
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:16,241
- It's French.
- French?

1054
01:04:16,285 --> 01:04:18,845
- You don't know nothing about that.
- Look, okay, whatever.

1055
01:04:18,888 --> 01:04:21,083
Jacuzzi, would you open
the gate, please?

1056
01:04:21,123 --> 01:04:23,557
No! You didn't even
remember my name.

1057
01:04:23,593 --> 01:04:26,858
I guess you also forgot how you
was all up on a sister

1058
01:04:26,896 --> 01:04:29,126
at the Christmas party?
Just all up in through here.

1059
01:04:29,165 --> 01:04:33,226
No no, I wasn't with you
at no company Christmas party.

1060
01:04:33,269 --> 01:04:34,896
What? Okay, hold on.

1061
01:04:34,937 --> 01:04:36,404
Hold on, hold on,
hold on, hold on.

1062
01:04:36,439 --> 01:04:39,408
Oh! What? Bam!

1063
01:04:39,442 --> 01:04:40,807
But uh...

1064
01:04:41,844 --> 01:04:43,436
Huh-uh.
What the hell!

1065
01:04:43,479 --> 01:04:45,572
- Hmm?
- No!

1066
01:04:45,615 --> 01:04:47,674
Is that a goat?

1067
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:49,241
Whoo!

1068
01:04:49,285 --> 01:04:52,379
Are we in the manger?
Okay, wait, hold on.

1069
01:04:52,421 --> 01:04:54,446
Is it all coming back
to you now?

1070
01:04:54,490 --> 01:04:56,924
Damn, do everybody
got pictures of me?

1071
01:04:56,959 --> 01:05:00,486
You promised me dinner,
Jake, and I want it.

1072
01:05:00,529 --> 01:05:03,327
- Look, fine.
- And I don't want no damn nine-piece.

1073
01:05:03,366 --> 01:05:06,267
I wanna go to a nice restaurant
where they got the salad bar

1074
01:05:06,302 --> 01:05:09,237
- and free refills.
- Okay, free refills, you got it, okay?

1075
01:05:09,272 --> 01:05:11,900
But right now, I'm gonna
have to ask you

1076
01:05:11,941 --> 01:05:14,239
- to get in the trunk.
- What?

1077
01:05:14,277 --> 01:05:16,302
Look, this is for your benefit
so you don't get fired

1078
01:05:16,345 --> 01:05:18,074
or nothing, okay,
from your job. Get in the trunk.

1079
01:05:18,114 --> 01:05:19,945
No, I ain't getting
in no trunk.

1080
01:05:19,982 --> 01:05:21,472
- Get in the trunk.
- No!

1081
01:05:21,517 --> 01:05:24,384
Get in the trunk.

1082
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:26,650
You went with Asian?

1083
01:05:31,027 --> 01:05:34,292
- Hello, Riley.
- Hello.

1084
01:05:34,330 --> 01:05:37,163
So tell us... what was
your meeting with Jake about?

1085
01:05:37,199 --> 01:05:40,032
Oh, we were discussing how
to get you behind bars.

1086
01:05:41,304 --> 01:05:42,771
What happened to you?

1087
01:05:42,805 --> 01:05:45,296
You used to be
a real team player.

1088
01:05:45,341 --> 01:05:49,869
Well, that was when the team
made video games, not weapons.

1089
01:05:53,215 --> 01:05:55,740
You shouldn't have
called the FBI.

1090
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:58,618
At the time I didn't know
that you'd bought a few agents.

1091
01:05:58,654 --> 01:06:01,020
One less, thanks
to your friend Jake.

1092
01:06:01,057 --> 01:06:03,116
What? What are you
talking about?

1093
01:06:03,159 --> 01:06:06,686
Eric, I think you should
take a look at this.

1094
01:06:11,334 --> 01:06:13,165
Shh!

1095
01:06:15,905 --> 01:06:17,395
It's this way.

1096
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:18,668
How do you know?

1097
01:06:18,708 --> 01:06:20,608
I just do.

1098
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:22,577
Bad memory and
an attitude.

1099
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:36,749
Okay, this is it.

1100
01:06:45,935 --> 01:06:48,028
Colonel Bowman's
revenge.

1101
01:06:49,805 --> 01:06:51,773
Remember...
we get in, we get out.

1102
01:06:51,807 --> 01:06:52,967
Okay.

1103
01:06:57,046 --> 01:07:01,312
This is the motion capture stage
for the game designers.

1104
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:04,046
I remember
sneaking in here.

1105
01:07:04,086 --> 01:07:05,212
Check this out.

1106
01:07:06,355 --> 01:07:08,255
This is it.
This is the throne

1107
01:07:08,290 --> 01:07:10,155
of the drug lord,
code name "The Rat. "

1108
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:12,319
I knew it! I knew
all this stuff was real!

1109
01:07:12,361 --> 01:07:13,419
So now what?

1110
01:07:13,462 --> 01:07:16,363
"Boca Raton," baby.
You said it yourself...

1111
01:07:16,399 --> 01:07:19,800
"the mouth of the rat. "

1112
01:07:19,835 --> 01:07:21,598
I hid the X-1
right here.

1113
01:07:26,008 --> 01:07:28,499
- The chip!
- How do you like me now?

1114
01:07:28,544 --> 01:07:31,638
- You did it!
- That's right, I did it.

1115
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:33,978
Okay, come on.
Let's get out of here.

1116
01:07:35,618 --> 01:07:37,677
So nice of you to come,
Mr. Rodgers.

1117
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:39,244
So nice of you to come,
Mr. Rodgers.

1118
01:07:39,288 --> 01:07:40,619
So nice of you to come,
Mr. Rodgers.

1119
01:07:40,656 --> 01:07:42,920
Thanks for calling the FBI
on such an important matter.

1120
01:07:42,958 --> 01:07:45,188
Anything I can do
to help my country.

1121
01:07:45,227 --> 01:07:47,286
You fellas
got some ID?

1122
01:07:49,031 --> 01:07:51,261
You're a cautious man.
That's good.

1123
01:07:53,469 --> 01:07:55,232
Now hand over the chip.

1124
01:07:55,271 --> 01:07:56,761
Got a little something
for me?

1125
01:07:56,806 --> 01:07:58,398
Here it is...

1126
01:07:58,441 --> 01:08:00,306
$1/4-million
in thanks.

1127
01:08:00,342 --> 01:08:02,640
Obviously, this is
just between us.

1128
01:08:02,678 --> 01:08:05,670
It seems a little more
than a thank you.

1129
01:08:05,714 --> 01:08:07,511
Seems like a payoff.

1130
01:08:07,550 --> 01:08:09,484
I was just testing you.

1131
01:08:09,518 --> 01:08:10,985
Something's not right here.

1132
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:12,487
Don't get too clever,
janitor.

1133
01:08:12,521 --> 01:08:15,581
Give us the chip
and take your gift.

1134
01:08:15,624 --> 01:08:18,821
I got a feeling
if I give you this chip

1135
01:08:18,861 --> 01:08:21,056
I ain't getting no gift.
Am I right?

1136
01:08:21,097 --> 01:08:23,258
I ain't leaving
this room either, am I?

1137
01:08:23,299 --> 01:08:25,733
Ah.

1138
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:27,497
Man, I ain't got
the chip with me.

1139
01:08:27,536 --> 01:08:29,265
I mean, do I look
like a sucker?

1140
01:08:29,305 --> 01:08:31,296
I mean, do you think
I'm gonna come into a strange room

1141
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:32,500
with the thing
in my pocket?

1142
01:08:32,541 --> 01:08:34,008
No, man!

1143
01:08:50,493 --> 01:08:52,461
Okay, yeah.

1144
01:08:52,495 --> 01:08:54,190
Yeah, I remember
everything now.

1145
01:08:54,230 --> 01:08:55,788
Y'all in some shit.

1146
01:08:55,831 --> 01:08:58,163
Yeah, you... I'm gonna
take my right elbow

1147
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:01,192
and hit you in the
Adam's apple, knock it out.

1148
01:09:01,237 --> 01:09:04,070
Then you... I'm gonna
kick you with my size-12 shoe...

1149
01:09:07,243 --> 01:09:09,711
And then you... I'm gonna
hit you with him!

1150
01:09:09,745 --> 01:09:12,236
And there ain't gonna be
a damn thing you can do about it,

1151
01:09:12,281 --> 01:09:15,114
because I'm with the CIA! Ha!

1152
01:09:19,121 --> 01:09:22,750
Jake, what are you
talking about? The CIA?

1153
01:09:22,791 --> 01:09:25,123
You said it on the answering
machine... I'm with the Agency.

1154
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:28,995
The Agency for
Custodial Professionals.

1155
01:09:29,031 --> 01:09:31,966
Jake, you're a janitor!

1156
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:33,025
Wha...?

1157
01:09:40,743 --> 01:09:42,040
Uh-oh.

1158
01:09:42,077 --> 01:09:43,635
We're gonna die!

1159
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:44,976
Run!

1160
01:09:45,981 --> 01:09:47,278
Shoot!

1161
01:09:54,924 --> 01:09:55,982
Argh!

1162
01:09:59,762 --> 01:10:02,663
How are we supposed
to get in and get out now?

1163
01:10:02,698 --> 01:10:04,461
Hey, wh... wh...

1164
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:08,693
We're trapped, Gina.

1165
01:10:09,872 --> 01:10:11,897
They got us!
They got us!

1166
01:10:16,779 --> 01:10:19,009
So I'm just a janitor.

1167
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:21,573
I don't fight crime,
I fight grime!

1168
01:10:22,785 --> 01:10:24,946
I get it, I get it.

1169
01:10:30,192 --> 01:10:32,717
I'm running out
of bullets.

1170
01:10:32,761 --> 01:10:34,956
We should just give up.

1171
01:10:34,997 --> 01:10:36,988
Hey, we give up!
We're coming out!

1172
01:10:40,803 --> 01:10:43,772
Jake, I need you to pull yourself
together right now, okay?

1173
01:10:43,806 --> 01:10:45,501
Okay.
All right, all right.

1174
01:10:47,610 --> 01:10:50,374
- I need your help!
- Oh!

1175
01:10:50,412 --> 01:10:51,970
Okay.

1176
01:10:56,819 --> 01:10:58,116
Okay.

1177
01:11:04,860 --> 01:11:07,294
This ain't
what you want!

1178
01:11:24,413 --> 01:11:26,643
I'm out.

1179
01:11:34,023 --> 01:11:35,752
Go!

1180
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:47,191
I knew it was a weapon.

1181
01:11:49,538 --> 01:11:51,335
What are you doing?
Jake?

1182
01:11:51,373 --> 01:11:54,274
Come on.
Come on, let's go.

1183
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:56,369
You, go!

1184
01:11:57,413 --> 01:12:00,041
Go on!

1185
01:12:07,022 --> 01:12:09,547
Ooh.

1186
01:12:09,591 --> 01:12:10,888
Wow.

1187
01:12:12,394 --> 01:12:14,225
Go on, go!

1188
01:12:19,435 --> 01:12:20,868
Oh.

1189
01:12:21,870 --> 01:12:23,360
Jake!

1190
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:27,265
- Come on!
- Go go! Go go go go!

1191
01:12:45,060 --> 01:12:46,891
Give it up, Jake.
You can't win.

1192
01:12:48,430 --> 01:12:50,159
You're just a janitor.

1193
01:12:57,272 --> 01:12:59,570
Yahh! Yeah, you're
being mopped by The Cleaner!

1194
01:13:05,647 --> 01:13:10,209
- Huh.
- Damn, he hit me!

1195
01:13:10,252 --> 01:13:12,550
Stop right there,
Mr. Hauck!

1196
01:13:12,588 --> 01:13:14,385
Do you know who I am?

1197
01:13:14,423 --> 01:13:17,119
Yes, sir.
We're just doing our job.

1198
01:13:17,159 --> 01:13:18,649
Too bad.

1199
01:13:23,432 --> 01:13:24,922
Huh?

1200
01:13:26,668 --> 01:13:28,693
- Ooh!
- Damn, girl.

1201
01:13:37,579 --> 01:13:39,012
Get 'em, girl!

1202
01:13:45,521 --> 01:13:46,852
Oh, shit.

1203
01:13:54,163 --> 01:13:55,425
How do you like that?

1204
01:14:15,017 --> 01:14:16,348
You all right?

1205
01:14:17,519 --> 01:14:20,249
Hand over the chip,
mop boy.

1206
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:22,348
Mop boy?
This ain't what you want.

1207
01:14:29,965 --> 01:14:32,729
And that's for wearing
pink underwear,

1208
01:14:32,768 --> 01:14:34,531
you freak.

1209
01:14:34,570 --> 01:14:37,038
Come on.

1210
01:14:37,072 --> 01:14:38,562
Oh.

1211
01:14:38,607 --> 01:14:39,938
You all right?

1212
01:14:39,975 --> 01:14:42,239
Oh, Jake,
that was amazing.

1213
01:14:42,277 --> 01:14:46,145
Well, people do some
pretty incredible things

1214
01:14:46,181 --> 01:14:47,978
when they're scared
out of their minds.

1215
01:14:49,818 --> 01:14:51,615
Don't make me laugh.
It hurts.

1216
01:14:51,653 --> 01:14:52,847
Am I bleeding?

1217
01:14:52,888 --> 01:14:54,651
No.

1218
01:14:54,690 --> 01:14:55,884
He... he hit me
in the mouth.

1219
01:14:55,924 --> 01:14:58,620
I wish I had
my nunchucks. Yeah.

1220
01:14:58,660 --> 01:15:00,958
Get out of my way.

1221
01:15:04,266 --> 01:15:06,826
...stomach.
He hit me, and it kind of hurt.

1222
01:15:06,869 --> 01:15:08,200
- Yeah, but then you came back.
- Then I'm... bow!

1223
01:15:08,237 --> 01:15:09,602
He was on me...

1224
01:15:09,638 --> 01:15:12,539
There he is.
Jake!

1225
01:15:12,574 --> 01:15:14,041
- Hey-hey!
- Good work.

1226
01:15:14,076 --> 01:15:16,601
- Yeah, man.
- I'm never gonna forget this.

1227
01:15:16,645 --> 01:15:18,112
Hey, I'm just
happy to help.

1228
01:15:18,146 --> 01:15:19,875
So you two were working
together all along?

1229
01:15:19,915 --> 01:15:21,678
Well, Jake discovered the X-1,
he came to me,

1230
01:15:21,717 --> 01:15:23,776
and together we planned
how to flush these guys out.

1231
01:15:23,819 --> 01:15:25,309
Gina...

1232
01:15:25,354 --> 01:15:27,447
I never should have
doubted you.

1233
01:15:27,489 --> 01:15:29,889
- Nice work.
- Thank you, sir.

1234
01:15:29,925 --> 01:15:32,416
I couldn't have done it
without Jake Rodgers.

1235
01:15:32,461 --> 01:15:34,326
This is my boss,
Martin Crane.

1236
01:15:34,363 --> 01:15:35,990
So you're "the" Jake?

1237
01:15:36,031 --> 01:15:37,589
Jake Rodgers.
How are you?

1238
01:15:37,633 --> 01:15:38,930
The Bureau thanks you.

1239
01:15:38,967 --> 01:15:41,231
Well, everybody except
for Shaw, right?

1240
01:15:41,270 --> 01:15:44,034
Listen, we could use
a good man like you.

1241
01:15:44,072 --> 01:15:46,131
How would you like
to join our training program?

1242
01:15:46,174 --> 01:15:48,142
What? Me?

1243
01:15:50,178 --> 01:15:51,645
The FBI?

1244
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:53,807
Like, with... with the whole
badge and everything?

1245
01:15:53,849 --> 01:15:55,680
I don't know.
L...

1246
01:15:57,052 --> 01:15:59,350
No, sir,

1247
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:01,754
I'm gonna stick
with the Agency.

1248
01:16:01,790 --> 01:16:03,883
Somebody's gotta
keep this place clean.

1249
01:16:03,926 --> 01:16:05,860
It's what I do.

1250
01:16:05,894 --> 01:16:09,193
Jake, I don't think that needs
to concern you anymore.

1251
01:16:09,231 --> 01:16:11,893
I trusted you
and you came through.

1252
01:16:11,934 --> 01:16:13,424
I got a little surprise
for you.

1253
01:16:13,468 --> 01:16:15,561
What are you talking about?
Don't do this, man.

1254
01:16:15,604 --> 01:16:16,901
I don't like
surprises.

1255
01:16:18,473 --> 01:16:20,202
Where do you think
you're going?

1256
01:16:20,242 --> 01:16:22,608
You again?

1257
01:16:26,315 --> 01:16:28,476
Wow.

1258
01:16:30,686 --> 01:16:33,211
Two ladies fighting
over a janitor.

1259
01:16:38,660 --> 01:16:41,128
- #... Far as I know,
you're a freak #

1260
01:16:41,163 --> 01:16:43,324
# Look nasty girl that shake
her ass to the beat #

1261
01:16:43,365 --> 01:16:45,959
- # To the beat, phat phat
skee skee... #

1262
01:16:46,001 --> 01:16:48,060
# 'Cause I'm ready for the girl,
but she don't come cheap #

1263
01:16:48,103 --> 01:16:49,798
# Aha, far as I know,
you're a freak... #

1264
01:16:57,145 --> 01:17:00,137
Come on, get up.
Had enough?

1265
01:17:01,149 --> 01:17:03,515
- Jake. Jake!
- Huh?

1266
01:17:03,552 --> 01:17:05,213
Are you just gonna
stand there and watch?

1267
01:17:05,253 --> 01:17:07,312
Hell yeah!

1268
01:17:08,857 --> 01:17:10,757
Okay.
Don't blink.

1269
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:28,633
Hey, babe, I don't think
we're gonna make it.

1270
01:17:30,579 --> 01:17:31,876
And you...

1271
01:17:31,913 --> 01:17:35,144
you can use some hot cocoa
and a nap. Come on.

1272
01:17:35,183 --> 01:17:37,515
Easy.

1273
01:17:44,626 --> 01:17:45,923
You!

1274
01:17:45,961 --> 01:17:48,828
Hey hey, Jacuzzi.

1275
01:17:48,864 --> 01:17:50,525
Do you have any idea

1276
01:17:50,565 --> 01:17:52,590
what being locked in
a trunk for eight hours

1277
01:17:52,634 --> 01:17:54,363
does to a black
woman's hair?

1278
01:17:54,403 --> 01:17:55,836
I'm guessing
not good, right?

1279
01:17:55,871 --> 01:17:57,429
Mmm, you guess right.

1280
01:17:57,472 --> 01:18:01,568
A sister is not happy if her hair
is nappy, all right?

1281
01:18:01,610 --> 01:18:03,805
You owe me a visit
to my stylist Kiki

1282
01:18:03,845 --> 01:18:06,245
over at the salon called
"Hair This. " Why?

1283
01:18:06,281 --> 01:18:08,044
'Cause a sister needs
to get her hair did.

1284
01:18:08,083 --> 01:18:09,778
I want some highlights,

1285
01:18:09,818 --> 01:18:11,547
and I'm thinking
the highlights

1286
01:18:11,586 --> 01:18:13,952
make a sister look
a little more Latin.

1287
01:18:13,989 --> 01:18:16,423
- Eh?
- Latin?

1288
01:18:16,458 --> 01:18:18,221
Ah!

1289
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:20,558
Okay, you got it.
You know, yes, definitely.

1290
01:18:20,595 --> 01:18:21,721
All right.

1291
01:18:21,763 --> 01:18:23,731
Do you salsa?

1292
01:18:23,765 --> 01:18:25,562
Ooh, he cute.
Uh!

1293
01:18:28,804 --> 01:18:30,465
What's up, fellas?

1294
01:18:30,505 --> 01:18:32,132
There he is.
There he is...

1295
01:18:32,174 --> 01:18:33,766
Look, before you get
started, man...

1296
01:18:33,809 --> 01:18:37,040
...Mr. Big Hotshot
Video Game Maker.

1297
01:18:37,079 --> 01:18:39,411
I can't believe you gave up
your mop for this suit.

1298
01:18:39,448 --> 01:18:42,542
Look, fellas, this was
a really hard decision.

1299
01:18:42,584 --> 01:18:45,052
I mean, not really,
but if... for real...

1300
01:18:45,087 --> 01:18:47,180
but I'll make us
some good games and...

1301
01:18:47,222 --> 01:18:48,849
G- g-games? I got game ideas.
I've been holding them in.

1302
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:50,152
I'm gonna let 'em out.

1303
01:18:50,192 --> 01:18:52,285
What... what about the one...
"The Deadbeat Daddies. "

1304
01:18:52,327 --> 01:18:55,228
The objective of the game is to avoid
your baby mama... her legal team...

1305
01:18:55,263 --> 01:18:57,254
you gotta keep switching
your social security number,

1306
01:18:57,299 --> 01:18:59,859
and they can't get a DNA sample.
They take you on them talk shows about...

1307
01:18:59,901 --> 01:19:02,233
"Look at his face, look at his eyes,
look how much they look alike. "

1308
01:19:02,270 --> 01:19:03,931
"Look how much they look alike. "
That's how the game gonna say it...

1309
01:19:03,972 --> 01:19:05,337
"Look how much they look alike. "

1310
01:19:05,373 --> 01:19:07,466
- And you gotta avoid all that.
- That's good, man, that's good.

1311
01:19:07,509 --> 01:19:08,840
I heard it was based
on a true story, too.

1312
01:19:08,877 --> 01:19:10,606
- Ronnie, I'm gonna have to go, man.
- Whoa, wait, whoa whoa,

1313
01:19:10,645 --> 01:19:12,476
one more... what about the mad
janitor versus the co-worker

1314
01:19:12,514 --> 01:19:14,641
with the promotion? Yeah. I'll
t... I'll track you down and...

1315
01:19:14,683 --> 01:19:16,207
I mean, he... in the game...
will track you down...

1316
01:19:16,251 --> 01:19:17,980
- Hey, look...
... and he take care of you,

1317
01:19:18,019 --> 01:19:19,111
and... and... and... and...
and take you out.

1318
01:19:19,154 --> 01:19:20,553
I'm... I w...
I'm gonna call you, okay?

1319
01:19:20,589 --> 01:19:21,715
Wait, I got, like,
10 more.

1320
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:23,748
Just don't forget
where you came from.

1321
01:19:23,792 --> 01:19:25,987
Yeah, because the broom
don't wait on nobody, baby.

1322
01:19:26,027 --> 01:19:28,325
You understand?
This is mop life, mop life!

1323
01:19:28,363 --> 01:19:29,921
So sweep on!

1324
01:19:29,965 --> 01:19:31,626
You think he liked
my ideas?

1325
01:19:31,666 --> 01:19:33,463
Oh, yeah yeah.

1326
01:19:38,673 --> 01:19:41,301
Hey.
How's the game?

1327
01:19:41,343 --> 01:19:42,810
Eh, working on it.

1328
01:19:42,844 --> 01:19:45,005
Level five's too damn easy,
but, uh, we're tweaking it.

1329
01:19:45,046 --> 01:19:47,276
Okay, we'll bring that up
at Thursday's meeting.

1330
01:19:47,315 --> 01:19:49,180
Thanks a lot, boss.

1331
01:19:49,217 --> 01:19:50,946
I appreciate everything
you've done for me.

1332
01:19:52,254 --> 01:19:53,585
How about a raise?

1333
01:19:53,622 --> 01:19:55,283
No.

1334
01:19:55,323 --> 01:19:56,790
Oh.

1335
01:19:56,825 --> 01:19:59,817
Just checking. I didn't
think you was going to...

1336
01:19:59,861 --> 01:20:01,260
Mmm?

1337
01:20:03,131 --> 01:20:04,860
Hey, Jake,
what's up?

1338
01:20:06,468 --> 01:20:09,369
Hey, what are you
doing here?

1339
01:20:09,404 --> 01:20:11,167
Surprise!

1340
01:20:11,206 --> 01:20:12,969
This is nice. Thank you.

1341
01:20:13,008 --> 01:20:14,737
That's beautiful.
Oh, wow.

1342
01:20:14,776 --> 01:20:17,404
"'The Cleaner'
Saves the Day! Love, Gina. "

1343
01:20:17,445 --> 01:20:20,243
That's right,
with the help of his

1344
01:20:20,282 --> 01:20:24,150
waitress-slash-agent-
slash-almost-Boo.

1345
01:20:26,021 --> 01:20:27,989
How about...

1346
01:20:28,023 --> 01:20:30,856
almost-getting-closer-Boo?

1347
01:20:30,892 --> 01:20:33,520
Oh, really? I thought you
just would have forgot about me.

1348
01:20:33,562 --> 01:20:36,224
How could I forget
about you?

1349
01:20:37,599 --> 01:20:40,864
Technically, this is
another time, another place.

1350
01:20:40,902 --> 01:20:44,429
True.
What are you thinking?

1351
01:20:45,574 --> 01:20:47,337
Dinner and ice skating?

1352
01:20:47,375 --> 01:20:49,434
Ice skating?
On no!

1353
01:20:49,477 --> 01:20:52,503
You are not getting me into
those tight pants again.

1354
01:20:52,547 --> 01:20:54,981
I was thinking more like
moonlight under the stars

1355
01:20:55,016 --> 01:20:56,483
in the Bahamas.

1356
01:20:56,518 --> 01:20:58,179
Sounds pretty romantic.

1357
01:20:58,220 --> 01:20:59,687
First class all the way.

1358
01:20:59,721 --> 01:21:01,712
Sounds expensive.

1359
01:21:02,724 --> 01:21:04,885
Why don't you
let me worry about that?

1360
01:21:06,127 --> 01:21:08,755
- Okay.
- Come on.

1361
01:21:08,797 --> 01:21:12,893
The waitress and
the janitor take on the world.

1362
01:21:12,934 --> 01:21:14,993
That's right.

1363
01:21:15,036 --> 01:21:16,799
Uh... hold on.

1364
01:21:23,011 --> 01:21:25,275
A spy's gotta eat,
right?

1365
01:21:26,314 --> 01:21:29,078
Eh? Let's spend
some of this money.

1366
01:21:29,117 --> 01:21:30,744
Ow!

1367
01:21:30,785 --> 01:21:33,345
Ooh! Ooh!

1368
01:21:35,090 --> 01:21:36,182
13 Baker 3, mark!

1369
01:21:36,224 --> 01:21:39,125
Oh, if you don't mind,

1370
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:41,788
could you pick me up
a little box of kittens

1371
01:21:41,830 --> 01:21:43,730
and a rainbow Afro?

1372
01:21:43,765 --> 01:21:46,290
And if you could get my eighth-grade
schoolteacher on the phone...

1373
01:21:46,334 --> 01:21:47,801
I'd really like
to talk to her.

1374
01:21:47,836 --> 01:21:50,304
One other thing...
some brown shoe polish

1375
01:21:50,338 --> 01:21:52,670
with a little sponge tip.
That's the kind I like.

1376
01:21:52,707 --> 01:21:56,143
And a Simon and Garfunkel album...
just the... just the album cover.

1377
01:21:56,177 --> 01:21:57,508
I don't need
the actual album.

1378
01:21:57,545 --> 01:21:59,672
I mean, if it's no trouble. You
can get yourself something nice,

1379
01:21:59,714 --> 01:22:01,045
maybe some
animal crackers or something.

1380
01:22:01,082 --> 01:22:02,379
Maybe, like, a little sparkly...

1381
01:22:02,417 --> 01:22:05,784
a little spinning hat or something
with little... little helicopters on top.

1382
01:22:08,156 --> 01:22:10,056
I'm sorry, Oprah,

1383
01:22:10,091 --> 01:22:12,525
I can't take you
to the Grammys, okay?

1384
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:14,118
You know why?

1385
01:22:14,162 --> 01:22:16,460
'Cause I need
a dirty girl.

1386
01:22:16,498 --> 01:22:18,898
Give me that. Stop!

1387
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:21,129
Okay? That causes shrinkage.

1388
01:22:21,169 --> 01:22:23,160
Keep the freezie
off the deezie.

1389
01:22:23,204 --> 01:22:24,796
Enough with the ice
on the dice.

1390
01:22:24,839 --> 01:22:27,307
You gotta be real dirty.
Can you be dirty?

1391
01:22:27,342 --> 01:22:28,707
Can you be dingy?

1392
01:22:28,743 --> 01:22:30,802
Can you not brush
your teeth for me?

1393
01:22:30,845 --> 01:22:33,245
I have a computer chick
in my hotel?

1394
01:22:33,281 --> 01:22:34,578
You have the hottest...

1395
01:22:34,616 --> 01:22:37,141
- computer chick ever.
- Computer chick in your hotel ever!

1396
01:22:37,185 --> 01:22:38,675
Nobody... nobody's...

1397
01:22:41,156 --> 01:22:43,420
...but I can't even go in
to pretend to give him a kiss?

1398
01:22:43,458 --> 01:22:46,291
Nyah!

1399
01:22:46,328 --> 01:22:48,455
You want me to take
your temperature?

1400
01:22:51,232 --> 01:22:53,200
That's right.
All the dirty girls, make noise!

1401
01:22:53,234 --> 01:22:56,533
"Please, Dirty Clean Rapper,
be with me!"

1402
01:22:56,571 --> 01:22:58,129
L... I'll think about it.

1403
01:22:58,173 --> 01:22:59,572
Here we go.

1404
01:23:00,775 --> 01:23:04,506
Ow! Ooh! Yeah!

1405
01:23:04,546 --> 01:23:06,013
- Lower.
- Do you think that's...

1406
01:23:06,047 --> 01:23:08,379
Hey, lady! Take these.

1407
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:11,874
I'm going to still
tell your wife.

1408
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:14,184
Your breath smells
like sauted ass.

1409
01:23:14,222 --> 01:23:15,450
...like trash date.

1410
01:23:16,524 --> 01:23:18,515
...smells like hot garbage.

1411
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:20,187
Eww!

1412
01:23:20,228 --> 01:23:21,889
I got two words for you...

1413
01:23:21,930 --> 01:23:23,659
Al-toids!

1414
01:23:23,698 --> 01:23:27,134
Lady, get your junk
in the trunk!

1415
01:23:27,168 --> 01:23:28,863
Are you the girl
from "Charlie's Angels"?

1416
01:23:31,206 --> 01:23:32,503
That's all I need.

1417
01:23:43,718 --> 01:23:46,482
# Everybody, bounce
if you know what I'm doin' #

1418
01:23:46,521 --> 01:23:48,955
# Get 'em up,
get 'em up, put 'em up #

1419
01:23:48,990 --> 01:23:51,117
# HP, KG, light 'em up #

1420
01:23:51,159 --> 01:23:53,127
# All the ladies got you
going crazy #

1421
01:23:53,161 --> 01:23:55,561
# All the fellas
gettin' that gravy #

1422
01:23:55,597 --> 01:23:57,394
# Get 'em up, keep 'em high #

1423
01:23:57,432 --> 01:24:00,299
# Once again, it's on
'cause everything is live #

1424
01:24:00,335 --> 01:24:01,893
# Live at the PJs #

1425
01:24:01,936 --> 01:24:04,302
# But it's the nine-nine independent
Mo Treader Hot's way #

1426
01:24:04,339 --> 01:24:06,432
# Yeah, if you're looking for
the boogie, you're looking for me #

1427
01:24:06,474 --> 01:24:08,601
# Everybody wanna party
with the R.O.C. #

1428
01:24:08,643 --> 01:24:11,271
# 'Cause, uh, we could
get tipsy, get busy #

1429
01:24:11,312 --> 01:24:13,610
# Hands up against me,
tell me that you with me #

1430
01:24:13,648 --> 01:24:15,809
# Ladies on the floor...
hands in the sky #

1431
01:24:15,850 --> 01:24:17,841
# Keep 'em up high,
keeping the party live #

1432
01:24:17,886 --> 01:24:20,184
# Baby, we don't stop,
baby, we don't quit #

1433
01:24:20,221 --> 01:24:22,416
# Now get a little closer,
come on, that's it #

1434
01:24:22,457 --> 01:24:24,550
# Making more and more hits,
everybody know #

1435
01:24:24,592 --> 01:24:26,719
# I keep 'em out of control
wherever I go #

1436
01:24:26,761 --> 01:24:28,319
# Now let me
hear you say "Ho... " #

1437
01:24:33,268 --> 01:24:35,259
# Look, baby #

1438
01:24:35,303 --> 01:24:38,534
# I'm sorry
I can't stay longer #

1439
01:24:38,573 --> 01:24:41,736
# I gotta do it, baby,
I gotta do it to you #

1440
01:24:41,776 --> 01:24:43,471
# I gotta go go #

1441
01:24:43,511 --> 01:24:45,376
# When time's on my tail,
better bail #

1442
01:24:45,413 --> 01:24:46,846
# It's either that
or go to jail #

1443
01:24:46,881 --> 01:24:48,405
# Professional,
so I leave no trail #

1444
01:24:48,450 --> 01:24:49,974
# They wanna see me
locked up in a cell #

1445
01:24:50,018 --> 01:24:51,451
# Run run run
from the ghetto bird #

1446
01:24:51,486 --> 01:24:53,147
# The whole precinct
on high alert #

1447
01:24:53,188 --> 01:24:54,849
# Tryin' to give me time
that I don't deserve #

1448
01:24:54,889 --> 01:24:56,254
# But my breakthrough
is full of dirt #

1449
01:24:56,291 --> 01:24:57,781
# Gotta go,
so I'm jumpin' fences #

1450
01:24:57,826 --> 01:24:59,521
# Being followed
by Doberman pinschers #

1451
01:24:59,561 --> 01:25:01,051
# Being watched
by TV, lasers #

1452
01:25:01,096 --> 01:25:02,563
# Gotta think quick
like a game of Tetris #

1453
01:25:02,597 --> 01:25:04,997
# You wanna catch the menace,
but I don't think I'ma let this #

1454
01:25:05,033 --> 01:25:06,694
# I'ma steal me a Lexus,
put pedal to the metal #

1455
01:25:06,734 --> 01:25:07,996
# So I'm gone
in 60 seconds #

1456
01:25:08,036 --> 01:25:09,503
# They wanna see me
locked up... #
