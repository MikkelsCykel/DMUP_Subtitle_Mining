1
00:01:31,377 --> 00:01:33,618
Joseph, you're a genius.

2
00:01:33,713 --> 00:01:36,819
That's my job. I'm a surgeon.

3
00:01:36,916 --> 00:01:38,896
But I'm no genius.

4
00:01:38,952 --> 00:01:40,761
Oh, my God.
It's Mitch.

5
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,561
I was just telling
your uncle here he's a genius.

6
00:01:42,722 --> 00:01:43,826
Now he's arguing with me.

7
00:01:44,123 --> 00:01:46,933
Well, you know us doctors,
very famous for our humility.

8
00:01:46,993 --> 00:01:50,440
- How you feeling?
- Like a man who can't wait to tee off.

9
00:01:50,496 --> 00:01:51,839
How long till I can
start playing again?

10
00:01:51,931 --> 00:01:54,741
Well, let's see how you heal first.
Could be four to six weeks,

11
00:01:54,801 --> 00:01:56,644
Really? That long?

12
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:57,908
We only want to
do this once.

13
00:01:59,572 --> 00:02:00,573
Okay.

14
00:02:00,807 --> 00:02:02,115
That's good.

15
00:02:02,175 --> 00:02:03,483
It was great to see
Ellie and the baby.

16
00:02:03,576 --> 00:02:04,748
When are they heading
back to New York?

17
00:02:04,811 --> 00:02:07,758
Beth and Grace are taking them
to the airport right now.

18
00:02:07,814 --> 00:02:10,124
Bet Beth hates to see them go.

19
00:02:10,183 --> 00:02:11,457
She's fine.

20
00:02:13,086 --> 00:02:16,499
Ethan, Ethan, we must say good-bye.

21
00:02:16,589 --> 00:02:19,092
I know it's gonna be hard, but.

22
00:02:20,426 --> 00:02:22,702
We just gotta suck it up
and not let our emotions get the best of us.

23
00:02:22,795 --> 00:02:25,435
Is that okay?
Is that okay with you?

24
00:02:25,498 --> 00:02:27,603
Because I know you're
thinking hard.

25
00:02:28,034 --> 00:02:30,708
Well, when you finish your thesis,
you should come to New York.

26
00:02:30,803 --> 00:02:32,180
We'll invite Jeff’s friend for dinner.

27
00:02:32,271 --> 00:02:33,375
I don't think he's my type.

28
00:02:33,806 --> 00:02:35,945
You haven't even met him.

29
00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:38,985
- Could you cover your mouth?
- Sorry.

30
00:02:39,045 --> 00:02:40,820
Maybe you're right.

31
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,053
All right, Mom, you gotta hand him over.

32
00:02:43,149 --> 00:02:44,287
Give Grandma a kiss.

33
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,852
Give Mi-Mi a kiss good-bye.

34
00:02:45,952 --> 00:02:48,660
Give Mi-Mi kisses.

35
00:02:48,721 --> 00:02:49,859
- No...
- Hey, buddy.

36
00:02:49,956 --> 00:02:52,197
Now, call me if it looks like
he's about to take his first step.

37
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:53,235
I'll fly to New York.

38
00:02:53,326 --> 00:02:55,465
Okay, we'll keep him off
the floor till you get there.

39
00:02:55,528 --> 00:02:57,132
- All right, honey. Bye-bye, love.
- I love you.

40
00:02:58,131 --> 00:03:00,907
How can a person not cover
his mouth when he sneezes,

41
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,138
especially around a baby?

42
00:03:02,201 --> 00:03:04,044
Yeah, especially around you.

43
00:03:04,137 --> 00:03:05,878
Babies are exhausting.

44
00:03:05,972 --> 00:03:07,974
It's different when they're yours.

45
00:03:09,642 --> 00:03:11,815
You're great with Ethan.

46
00:03:11,878 --> 00:03:13,255
Were you that patient with us?

47
00:03:13,346 --> 00:03:15,053
Still am.

48
00:03:15,148 --> 00:03:17,059
What did I do with my keys? There.

49
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:20,495
Do you think he'll remember us
next time he sees us?

50
00:03:25,825 --> 00:03:28,032
- God, I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

51
00:03:28,094 --> 00:03:30,199
- That's okay, honey.
- He won't forget you.

52
00:03:30,263 --> 00:03:32,834
- I know. I know. I know.
- I'm sorry. I'm an idiot.

53
00:03:32,899 --> 00:03:34,845
No, you're not an idiot.

54
00:03:36,436 --> 00:03:39,076
Oh, God.

55
00:03:39,172 --> 00:03:40,173
Please.

56
00:03:41,374 --> 00:03:42,375
Hi, Dad.

57
00:03:43,342 --> 00:03:44,343
I thought I called your mom.

58
00:03:45,211 --> 00:03:47,020
You did. She's busy.

59
00:03:47,847 --> 00:03:49,087
<i>Did they get off all right?</i>

60
00:03:49,182 --> 00:03:50,889
They're on the plane.

61
00:03:51,184 --> 00:03:53,755
Ask Mom if she remembered
to pick up my stuff at the cleaners.

62
00:03:54,053 --> 00:03:55,225
Did you get Dad's stuff?

63
00:03:56,355 --> 00:03:57,698
Yes, she did.

64
00:03:57,757 --> 00:03:59,293
<i>Put her on.
I have to ask her something.</i>

65
00:04:00,693 --> 00:04:01,694
She'll call you back.

66
00:04:03,763 --> 00:04:06,539
Well, she can't.
I'm going into surgery.

67
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,280
Wait a minute. She's upset.

68
00:04:09,368 --> 00:04:11,541
Of course. Is she crying?

69
00:04:12,371 --> 00:04:14,282
A little, we all cried.

70
00:04:15,475 --> 00:04:16,977
Okay, you can do this.

71
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:19,617
Tell her to please calm down.

72
00:04:22,482 --> 00:04:23,756
Okay.

73
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:25,620
Thank you, sweetie.

74
00:04:25,751 --> 00:04:26,786
- I'll drive.
- No.

75
00:04:26,886 --> 00:04:27,921
Okay.

76
00:04:36,395 --> 00:04:38,272
Dad can be kind of
a prick sometimes.

77
00:04:38,397 --> 00:04:39,432
He thinks I overreact.

78
00:04:39,499 --> 00:04:42,139
When you do what he does,
you gotta have a thick skin.

79
00:04:42,235 --> 00:04:43,839
Honey, he's not a prick.

80
00:04:43,936 --> 00:04:45,643
You always defend him.

81
00:04:50,409 --> 00:04:51,479
Oh, my God.

82
00:04:57,082 --> 00:04:58,322
- Turn around!
- What?

83
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,327
- Oh, my God!
- What? We're on the freeway.

84
00:05:00,418 --> 00:05:01,658
We got to go back,
I saw something.

85
00:05:01,753 --> 00:05:02,788
What... Like a body?

86
00:05:02,988 --> 00:05:04,331
- Take that exit right there!
- I'm taking it!

87
00:05:04,422 --> 00:05:06,333
- God, take it easy, Miss Daisy.
- Turn around!

88
00:05:06,424 --> 00:05:08,768
I can't turn around.
We're on the freeway!

89
00:05:12,197 --> 00:05:13,642
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

90
00:05:13,698 --> 00:05:15,006
Mom, are you sure about this?

91
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,704
Get out on this side.

92
00:05:16,801 --> 00:05:18,041
No shit.

93
00:05:28,947 --> 00:05:30,119
Here.

94
00:05:44,296 --> 00:05:46,071
Hey! Hey, fella!

95
00:05:46,965 --> 00:05:49,002
Here, boy.

96
00:05:49,067 --> 00:05:50,171
Hey!

97
00:05:55,207 --> 00:05:56,709
- Don't touch him!
- Okay.

98
00:05:56,808 --> 00:05:58,185
He's filthy.

99
00:05:58,577 --> 00:06:00,853
- He could have rabies.
- I know.

100
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:03,390
- It's okay.
- Why isn't he standing up?

101
00:06:03,481 --> 00:06:04,755
Is this like one of those
subway accidents,

102
00:06:04,849 --> 00:06:07,420
where you lift him up
and all his guts fall out?

103
00:06:07,986 --> 00:06:10,193
Honey, he's terrified.

104
00:06:10,255 --> 00:06:12,030
What can we feed him
to make friends?

105
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:14,097
I know. All right, I got it.

106
00:06:14,359 --> 00:06:16,566
Yes, hello, 9-1-1?

107
00:06:16,661 --> 00:06:19,437
Listen, this isn't
a life-and-death emergency, exactly.

108
00:06:19,531 --> 00:06:21,408
No one has a gun or anything.

109
00:06:21,499 --> 00:06:23,069
No, I said no gun!

110
00:06:23,335 --> 00:06:25,076
- I got it!
- Hello?

111
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:26,171
- Here we go!
- Hello?

112
00:06:26,238 --> 00:06:27,581
- Damn it.
- Look, look, look, look.

113
00:06:27,672 --> 00:06:30,676
Ethan loves these.
He loves these.

114
00:06:30,742 --> 00:06:31,846
I think you will too.

115
00:06:32,944 --> 00:06:34,184
Watch it!

116
00:06:36,848 --> 00:06:38,691
Hey, buddy. That's a boy.

117
00:06:40,218 --> 00:06:41,595
Good boy!

118
00:06:41,686 --> 00:06:43,893
There. Oh, my God, he took it.

119
00:06:43,955 --> 00:06:45,059
9-1-1?

120
00:06:45,223 --> 00:06:49,535
Thank God, I am on I-70
near Chambers Road.

121
00:06:49,594 --> 00:06:52,302
And this is a life-and-death
emergency.

122
00:06:54,866 --> 00:06:56,573
Never mind. We're cool.

123
00:06:56,635 --> 00:06:58,308
Mom, look.

124
00:07:02,974 --> 00:07:05,386
We're just not allowed
to deal with animals of an unknown threat.

125
00:07:05,443 --> 00:07:06,478
I mean, this...

126
00:07:06,578 --> 00:07:07,784
- Durley.
- Yeah?

127
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:09,449
- We gotta go.
- What do you mean?

128
00:07:09,547 --> 00:07:11,151
I talked to Animal Control.

129
00:07:11,249 --> 00:07:13,160
They'll be here sometime
in the next two hours.

130
00:07:13,251 --> 00:07:15,390
Two hours!
That's all you're gonna do for us?

131
00:07:15,453 --> 00:07:18,297
Well, no, in this circumstance,

132
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:20,563
we are authorized to
put the animal down.

133
00:07:22,661 --> 00:07:24,663
I think you'd better go.

134
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,740
I'm sorry, folks.
Them's the rules.

135
00:07:27,799 --> 00:07:29,107
Good luck.

136
00:07:33,238 --> 00:07:34,273
Do you think we
can move him?

137
00:07:34,339 --> 00:07:35,682
You mean, touch him?

138
00:07:35,774 --> 00:07:38,277
This is one of those rare occasions
when I wish I had a man I could call.

139
00:07:38,576 --> 00:07:39,577
Me too.

140
00:07:41,146 --> 00:07:44,753
Honey, there really are
a lot of great men out there.

141
00:07:44,816 --> 00:07:46,295
You have to make some effort.

142
00:07:46,351 --> 00:07:48,991
Mom, let's keep our eye on the ball.

143
00:07:49,087 --> 00:07:50,430
How are we supposed to move him?

144
00:07:51,923 --> 00:07:52,993
Where is it?

145
00:07:54,492 --> 00:07:55,994
Yeah. Yeah.

146
00:07:56,828 --> 00:07:58,171
Okay.

147
00:08:03,935 --> 00:08:05,642
Here is a giraffe.

148
00:08:07,605 --> 00:08:11,109
What kind of assholes left you
out here all alone, huh?

149
00:08:12,977 --> 00:08:15,116
Silk. Good idea.

150
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,853
Good boy. Good boy.

151
00:08:16,948 --> 00:08:20,191
Now, nobody's gonna hurt you.
Get ready for him to go crazy.

152
00:08:20,285 --> 00:08:22,128
Just get ready. Here we go.

153
00:08:22,721 --> 00:08:24,325
There you go. Okay.

154
00:08:24,389 --> 00:08:27,165
Okay. There you go.

155
00:08:27,225 --> 00:08:28,670
Now, here we go. Okay.

156
00:08:28,727 --> 00:08:30,536
Come on. Come on, darling.

157
00:08:30,628 --> 00:08:31,663
- Come on, boy.
- Come on.

158
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:33,209
- Take a right.
- Look! No broken bones!

159
00:08:33,298 --> 00:08:34,800
Look at that! Yeah.

160
00:08:35,133 --> 00:08:36,703
It's gonna be so warm in there.

161
00:08:36,801 --> 00:08:41,341
Now, on the count of three,
we're gonna throw this shirt over his head

162
00:08:41,406 --> 00:08:42,544
and lift him in, okay?

163
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,211
Don't you want to use
one of Dad's suits to protect the seat?

164
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:47,551
Pay attention.

165
00:08:47,645 --> 00:08:48,919
Ready?

166
00:08:49,013 --> 00:08:50,583
Okay!

167
00:08:50,682 --> 00:08:53,492
One, two...

168
00:08:54,319 --> 00:08:55,525
There.

169
00:08:58,089 --> 00:08:59,432
Three.

170
00:09:03,528 --> 00:09:04,905
Thank you.

171
00:09:06,931 --> 00:09:08,911
Hello, I'm Dr. Bhoola.

172
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,537
So, Mrs. Winter, you saved this dog's life?

173
00:09:11,603 --> 00:09:13,378
I don't know about that.

174
00:09:13,438 --> 00:09:15,714
Not many people would have stopped
in this weather.

175
00:09:15,774 --> 00:09:17,219
You must have
a dog of your own.

176
00:09:17,275 --> 00:09:18,345
No, no.

177
00:09:18,543 --> 00:09:19,681
Then you must be a dog person.

178
00:09:20,178 --> 00:09:21,680
Well, I don't know.

179
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,890
How about you?
Are you a dog person?

180
00:09:29,187 --> 00:09:31,633
Yeah, I can't keep my hands off 'em.

181
00:09:36,795 --> 00:09:38,866
Well, there's no chip in him.

182
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:40,534
There's no way to trace the owner.

183
00:09:40,598 --> 00:09:41,599
He's a little nicked up.

184
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,703
He has a cut on his muzzle,
a few hot spots.

185
00:09:44,769 --> 00:09:47,409
We'll get the blood panel back tomorrow.
But if I had to guess,

186
00:09:47,472 --> 00:09:51,978
there's nothing wrong with this dog
a few good meals and a bath won't fix.

187
00:09:52,076 --> 00:09:53,111
That's great.

188
00:09:54,312 --> 00:09:56,383
I hope one of you
will take him home.

189
00:09:58,049 --> 00:10:00,120
I just can't.

190
00:10:00,218 --> 00:10:03,290
I have my thesis,
and it's time-consuming,

191
00:10:03,388 --> 00:10:04,799
and I don't even know
why I'm doing it.

192
00:10:04,889 --> 00:10:05,993
It just goes on and on.

193
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:09,738
And I can't have pets
in my building, so...

194
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:15,906
Mrs. Winter?

195
00:10:16,234 --> 00:10:18,805
Me? No, no, no.

196
00:10:18,903 --> 00:10:22,009
No, the last thing my husband
wants right now is a dog, so...

197
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,586
That's too bad.

198
00:10:24,642 --> 00:10:27,521
His teeth are worn down,
if you'd just like to have a look.

199
00:10:27,612 --> 00:10:29,489
Yeah? No.

200
00:10:29,581 --> 00:10:33,461
Yeah, it looks like he was left alone a lot
and spent his time chewing on a chain.

201
00:10:33,952 --> 00:10:35,158
He's about seven.

202
00:10:35,253 --> 00:10:39,258
And the chances of a dog like him
being adopted from the shelter are minimal.

203
00:10:39,824 --> 00:10:41,633
So in about a week,

204
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,103
he's likely to be put down.

205
00:10:46,598 --> 00:10:47,770
Mom?

206
00:11:05,116 --> 00:11:06,891
- Good dog.
- Beth?

207
00:11:07,819 --> 00:11:08,889
Hi, honey.

208
00:11:08,987 --> 00:11:10,295
Dad, we're in here.

209
00:11:11,356 --> 00:11:12,835
Hello.

210
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:16,401
Hey, it's okay, boy. It's okay.

211
00:11:16,694 --> 00:11:18,901
Stay calm. Stay calm.

212
00:11:19,297 --> 00:11:21,208
You know, I think he's just startled by you.

213
00:11:21,466 --> 00:11:22,536
That's all. Easy.

214
00:11:22,967 --> 00:11:24,708
Hey! No!

215
00:11:26,237 --> 00:11:27,307
No barking!

216
00:11:29,974 --> 00:11:31,885
What's going on?
Whose dog is this?

217
00:11:31,976 --> 00:11:33,683
Mom's. She saved his life.

218
00:11:33,745 --> 00:11:35,816
He's not mine.
I'm just gonna find him a home.

219
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,058
Why is he here?

220
00:11:37,148 --> 00:11:39,059
I just couldn't let them
take him to the pound.

221
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,220
So what I'm gonna do is,

222
00:11:40,318 --> 00:11:42,058
I'm gonna call
a few rescue societies tomorrow,

223
00:11:42,152 --> 00:11:43,358
and somebody's going to want him.

224
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,932
Yeah, but not us, right?

225
00:11:45,022 --> 00:11:47,093
We're not getting a dog, right?

226
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:49,534
I think you should keep him. I'll help.

227
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,934
You're at school.

228
00:11:51,028 --> 00:11:53,030
She's not gonna come back
every morning and walk a dog,

229
00:11:53,096 --> 00:11:54,871
- and neither am I.
- I wouldn't mind doing that.

230
00:11:55,165 --> 00:11:56,235
Beth, I don't want a dog.

231
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:57,903
I told you, I'm gonna find him a home.

232
00:11:58,001 --> 00:11:59,446
Yeah, I know you.

233
00:11:59,536 --> 00:12:00,674
And what's that supposed to mean?

234
00:12:00,938 --> 00:12:03,077
- That was Dr. Bhoola.
- Who?

235
00:12:03,173 --> 00:12:04,880
The veterinarian.
He's gonna stop by.

236
00:12:04,942 --> 00:12:06,387
What is he...
He's coming here now?

237
00:12:06,443 --> 00:12:08,787
Yeah, he has some
medicine or something.

238
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:11,689
I'm gonna use your shower,
'cause it's filthy in here.

239
00:12:12,683 --> 00:12:13,889
The veterinarian makes house calls?

240
00:12:14,284 --> 00:12:15,957
He's very attractive.

241
00:12:19,723 --> 00:12:21,134
Did you see that?

242
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:23,802
- He's an amazing dog.
- I know.

243
00:12:25,028 --> 00:12:27,634
- You did a great thing by picking him up.
- I couldn't leave him.

244
00:12:27,731 --> 00:12:29,369
A lot of people just don't care.

245
00:12:29,433 --> 00:12:31,709
Joseph, I want you
to meet Dr. Bhoola.

246
00:12:31,768 --> 00:12:32,769
Sam, please.

247
00:12:32,869 --> 00:12:34,871
- It's nice to meet you, Dr. Winter.
- And you.

248
00:12:36,273 --> 00:12:37,479
Is this enough paper?

249
00:12:37,574 --> 00:12:38,814
Yeah, that's great.

250
00:12:38,909 --> 00:12:40,388
You don't want to get this stuff
on the floor.

251
00:12:40,444 --> 00:12:42,549
Come on, buddy.

252
00:12:42,613 --> 00:12:44,115
Okay, so...

253
00:12:46,149 --> 00:12:47,594
There's the irritation, right there.

254
00:12:47,651 --> 00:12:50,564
So you give it a little spritz, like so.

255
00:12:51,888 --> 00:12:53,993
- What are you naming him?
- Freeway.

256
00:12:54,391 --> 00:12:55,961
You've named him?

257
00:12:56,059 --> 00:12:59,268
Freeway, I bet you didn't think
you were going to a spa today, did you?

258
00:12:59,329 --> 00:13:00,569
Looks like you lucked out, buddy.

259
00:13:00,631 --> 00:13:01,803
Well, we're not keeping him.

260
00:13:02,566 --> 00:13:04,307
So says the pharaoh.

261
00:13:04,401 --> 00:13:06,608
If you keep him,
you'll be getting a great dog.

262
00:13:07,004 --> 00:13:09,075
Well, thanks for coming by.

263
00:13:09,139 --> 00:13:11,745
I hope my patients don't hear
that you make house calls.

264
00:13:11,908 --> 00:13:13,114
Do you think I could
take him for a walk?

265
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:15,014
Yeah, let's see how
he does on a leash.

266
00:13:15,979 --> 00:13:17,356
I'll go with you, if you like.

267
00:13:17,447 --> 00:13:19,950
That'd be great. I'll get my coat.

268
00:13:21,418 --> 00:13:22,624
Would you like to come?

269
00:13:22,686 --> 00:13:25,667
No, no, not at all. No.
I'm going to clean that bathroom.

270
00:13:25,756 --> 00:13:27,167
- Okay.
- Okay.

271
00:13:27,257 --> 00:13:28,292
Come, Freeway.

272
00:13:28,592 --> 00:13:29,935
Let's go.

273
00:13:31,528 --> 00:13:33,007
Come on, boy.

274
00:13:33,864 --> 00:13:36,276
- Should I go with them?
- God, no.

275
00:13:39,002 --> 00:13:40,276
Come on.

276
00:13:48,812 --> 00:13:49,984
Come on.

277
00:13:52,349 --> 00:13:54,386
Hey, wait for us! Freeway!

278
00:13:55,886 --> 00:13:58,457
Hey, where do you
think you're going, huh?

279
00:13:58,522 --> 00:13:59,626
Hurry up, honey.

280
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:01,692
I'm here. I'm behind you.

281
00:14:02,893 --> 00:14:04,463
Look what I found. Look at that.

282
00:14:04,528 --> 00:14:06,565
Yeah. Come on.

283
00:14:07,898 --> 00:14:09,639
How did you two meet?

284
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,202
- Don't ask.
- Don't... yeah.

285
00:14:11,301 --> 00:14:12,541
- No.
- I don't want to talk about it.

286
00:14:12,636 --> 00:14:14,547
- Why not?
- Let's just say.

287
00:14:14,638 --> 00:14:16,311
Well, it was embarrassing.

288
00:14:16,473 --> 00:14:17,679
There you go.

289
00:14:29,853 --> 00:14:31,890
That's his choice.

290
00:14:31,988 --> 00:14:34,594
He can get as many
opinions as he wants.

291
00:14:38,995 --> 00:14:40,372
Morning!

292
00:15:21,772 --> 00:15:24,252
Carmen, I'm out of basil.
Can you save me?

293
00:15:24,307 --> 00:15:27,117
There's extra in the shelf
behind the spice rack.

294
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:28,883
Good.

295
00:15:32,215 --> 00:15:33,768
- Carmen, we can't find
the big ladder.

296
00:15:33,769 --> 00:15:35,321
- Don't talk to me, I
have to get this right.

297
00:15:38,255 --> 00:15:39,791
The ladder.

298
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:43,269
In the shed, left side,
under the tarp.

299
00:15:43,794 --> 00:15:46,240
- The ceremony is starting
- Okay.

300
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:36,054
Aunt Grace is so pretty!

301
00:16:55,232 --> 00:16:56,336
Dad.

302
00:17:05,342 --> 00:17:06,343
<i>Namaste.</i>

303
00:17:06,409 --> 00:17:08,150
Welcome, everyone. I'm Todd.

304
00:17:08,812 --> 00:17:11,918
Grace and Sam have foolishly asked me
to officiate today.

305
00:17:13,683 --> 00:17:16,892
I recently was ordained
on the Internet, about last Wednesday,

306
00:17:16,987 --> 00:17:19,263
so feel confident,
I know what I'm doing.

307
00:17:30,901 --> 00:17:33,745
If the disk is massively herniated,
it's either got to be a laminectomy

308
00:17:33,837 --> 00:17:35,544
or it'd be microdiscectomy.

309
00:17:35,605 --> 00:17:37,380
It's unavoidable.

310
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,750
Have Ruthie send the MRI up here,
would you?

311
00:17:39,843 --> 00:17:40,844
- Right now.
- Come on, Ethan.

312
00:17:40,911 --> 00:17:42,447
I'll see you Monday.

313
00:17:42,545 --> 00:17:45,082
Dad, everyone's leaving.
Grandma's waiting.

314
00:17:45,181 --> 00:17:47,024
We have to go. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

315
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:50,587
Listen, I know he calls your mother "Mi-Mi,"
but does he have to call me "Pee-Pee"?

316
00:17:50,687 --> 00:17:53,759
He's trying to say "Poppy. "
He just can't say it yet,

317
00:17:53,857 --> 00:17:55,632
We're working on it,
though, right? Poppy?

318
00:17:55,725 --> 00:17:56,965
You're doing a great job with him.

319
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,097
Thank you.
Did you see Sam playing with him?

320
00:17:59,195 --> 00:18:00,936
I think he's going to be
a pretty amazing father.

321
00:18:01,031 --> 00:18:03,102
- Yeah. Hope so.
- Hope so,

322
00:18:03,199 --> 00:18:05,941
Speaking of amazing,
you girls looked amazing today.

323
00:18:06,036 --> 00:18:08,277
I've never seen
Gracie look so happy

324
00:18:08,371 --> 00:18:09,577
Yeah.

325
00:18:09,706 --> 00:18:10,776
Bride.

326
00:18:10,874 --> 00:18:12,114
- Hi!
- Here's the pretty bride.

327
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:13,152
Hi, honey.

328
00:18:13,243 --> 00:18:15,814
- All right, we're loading up.
- Okay,

329
00:18:16,313 --> 00:18:20,056
Gracie, you know, it's not too late
if you want to change your mind.

330
00:18:20,116 --> 00:18:22,221
Maybe after the honeymoon.
I want to see Bora-Bora.

331
00:18:22,585 --> 00:18:25,327
Fine. Just don't sleep with him.

332
00:18:25,422 --> 00:18:29,302
Dad, you know how when your daughter
asks for something on her wedding day,

333
00:18:29,391 --> 00:18:30,631
you have to do it?

334
00:18:30,726 --> 00:18:32,797
What, is that from The Godfather?

335
00:18:32,895 --> 00:18:36,104
These next few weeks may be hard on Mom.

336
00:18:36,165 --> 00:18:37,769
I'm sure, she'll be fine.

337
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:39,642
Will you make an effort?

338
00:18:39,735 --> 00:18:41,408
Well, I always do.

339
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:43,006
More?

340
00:18:43,105 --> 00:18:45,585
Will you try harder?

341
00:18:45,641 --> 00:18:47,143
<i>Promise?</i>

342
00:18:47,242 --> 00:18:48,915
Of course I will.

343
00:18:50,446 --> 00:18:51,857
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye.

344
00:18:51,947 --> 00:18:54,120
- Get home safe.
- Thanks.

345
00:18:54,183 --> 00:18:55,685
So why didn't Joseph invite me
to stay tonight

346
00:18:55,784 --> 00:18:56,819
since you're going to be here?

347
00:18:56,919 --> 00:18:58,091
Did you want to stay?

348
00:18:58,153 --> 00:19:01,430
No, I can't sleep in this altitude.

349
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:03,868
Where's your new boyfriend?
I want to say good-bye.

350
00:19:03,959 --> 00:19:06,769
- Really?
- I'm right here, darling girl.

351
00:19:07,963 --> 00:19:09,965
Let go of me, you sexy minx.

352
00:19:10,032 --> 00:19:13,536
We don't want everybody
to know, do we?

353
00:19:13,635 --> 00:19:15,046
Muriel, it's a delight.

354
00:19:15,137 --> 00:19:17,549
I should have known
Penny's mom would be a fox.

355
00:19:17,639 --> 00:19:19,209
Stop it, please.

356
00:19:19,308 --> 00:19:20,844
Mom? Mom?

357
00:19:20,943 --> 00:19:23,617
I can't sit in the back. I'll get carsick.

358
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,352
Especially on these horrible roads
you've got here.

359
00:19:25,447 --> 00:19:27,358
I know, Mom.
That's why I'm putting you in the front.

360
00:19:27,449 --> 00:19:28,792
I'll probably get sick anyway.

361
00:19:29,518 --> 00:19:31,191
Well, that's the spirit, Mom.

362
00:19:31,286 --> 00:19:33,493
Here, you know,
that's why I gave you that Tigan,

363
00:19:33,555 --> 00:19:35,466
to help with the carsickness.

364
00:19:35,557 --> 00:19:37,298
I didn't take it.

365
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:39,669
I don't know what's in that stuff.

366
00:19:39,728 --> 00:19:42,538
You know what's best for you, Mom.

367
00:19:42,631 --> 00:19:44,008
Bye.

368
00:19:47,469 --> 00:19:50,678
Jeff, thanks for sacrificing your sanity
for the good of the family.

369
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:52,477
No problem. I'll get her to the airport.

370
00:19:53,575 --> 00:19:55,486
Sam, you got a lot to live up to.

371
00:19:55,644 --> 00:19:56,816
Wait till you get to know my family.

372
00:19:57,813 --> 00:19:59,156
- Say it? Say it?
- Bye, Ethan.

373
00:19:59,548 --> 00:20:01,391
- Say "Poppy "
- Poppy

374
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:03,830
- Pee-Pee.
- We're trying!

375
00:20:03,886 --> 00:20:05,559
That'll do. Love you.

376
00:20:05,654 --> 00:20:07,224
- Bye, I love you.
- Bye.

377
00:20:07,322 --> 00:20:09,063
I love you! See you soon!

378
00:20:09,158 --> 00:20:10,102
- Bye-bye!
- Bye, Mom.

379
00:20:10,192 --> 00:20:11,330
Bye!

380
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:17,677
You shouldn't have told
her we were staying.

381
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,048
Bye!

382
00:20:33,282 --> 00:20:34,886
- Bye!
- Bye!

383
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,190
Bye-bye!

384
00:20:38,187 --> 00:20:40,360
Have a wonderful lime!

385
00:20:40,722 --> 00:20:42,565
Bye!

386
00:20:42,624 --> 00:20:43,967
It was really nice, actually.

387
00:20:44,393 --> 00:20:46,600
Everybody was in a good mood.

388
00:20:46,695 --> 00:20:49,539
No, Penny didn't say anything.

389
00:20:49,598 --> 00:20:51,874
Violet, no one was insulted.
Don't worry about it.

390
00:20:51,934 --> 00:20:56,076
I told them it was important
for you to be at your thing. it's fine.

391
00:20:56,138 --> 00:20:57,549
<i>Russell?</i>

392
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:02,488
No one will mistake him
for a rocket scientist.

393
00:21:02,578 --> 00:21:06,424
Except for my grandmother, who loved him.

394
00:21:06,482 --> 00:21:08,985
Kind of wish she'd marry him.

395
00:21:09,084 --> 00:21:10,995
Okay.

396
00:21:11,086 --> 00:21:12,656
Yeah, go ahead.

397
00:21:12,754 --> 00:21:14,961
All right. I love you.

398
00:21:15,057 --> 00:21:16,092
Hi.

399
00:21:16,158 --> 00:21:17,330
Why didn't your wife come?

400
00:21:17,426 --> 00:21:20,066
I'm not married. You're Carmen, right?

401
00:21:20,562 --> 00:21:23,304
I'm Bryan. I'm Joseph and Beth's nephew.

402
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,107
So, what, you live here?
You take care of this place?

403
00:21:27,903 --> 00:21:29,314
Caretaker a hard job?

404
00:21:29,404 --> 00:21:32,146
My other two jobs are harder.

405
00:21:32,674 --> 00:21:33,744
What's going on with your neck?

406
00:21:34,143 --> 00:21:35,588
It's killing me.

407
00:21:35,644 --> 00:21:37,590
- Maybe I can help.
- Are you a masseur?

408
00:21:38,147 --> 00:21:39,592
No, I'm a surgeon.

409
00:21:40,349 --> 00:21:41,987
Maybe you can help me slit my throat.

410
00:21:42,251 --> 00:21:45,027
Wow, tough day.
Wait, let me get it. I got it.

411
00:21:48,323 --> 00:21:50,360
All right, where to?

412
00:21:50,459 --> 00:21:52,336
- Out there.
- Okay.

413
00:21:54,096 --> 00:21:56,542
You guys really rocked. You didn't rock.

414
00:21:56,632 --> 00:21:59,272
You were blue grassing. I'm sorry.

415
00:21:59,334 --> 00:22:01,678
- Had a good time.
- Thank you. Okay.

416
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:03,181
Oh, God.

417
00:22:04,206 --> 00:22:06,186
Sweetie. Hello, sweetie.

418
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,385
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

419
00:22:13,482 --> 00:22:16,190
We've unloaded both girls.

420
00:22:16,285 --> 00:22:17,821
That just leaves Freeway.

421
00:22:17,886 --> 00:22:19,559
No, he's not going anywhere.

422
00:22:19,655 --> 00:22:21,066
He's a real mama's boy.

423
00:22:21,156 --> 00:22:24,694
What do you think about Russell?

424
00:22:24,793 --> 00:22:27,000
Penny has outdone herself this time.

425
00:22:27,062 --> 00:22:28,370
I don't know. It could be serious.

426
00:22:28,463 --> 00:22:29,840
She said she wanted to tell us something.

427
00:22:29,898 --> 00:22:32,572
Maybe they're getting married.

428
00:22:32,668 --> 00:22:34,011
- To that idiot?
- Hey...

429
00:22:34,069 --> 00:22:35,480
Come on.

430
00:22:35,537 --> 00:22:38,746
He's got the personality
of a used car salesman.

431
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,081
Penny is a bright woman.

432
00:22:41,176 --> 00:22:42,814
He charmed your mother at the reception.

433
00:22:43,312 --> 00:22:44,985
Exactly my point.

434
00:23:16,178 --> 00:23:18,715
Russell, Penny tells me
you're in demolition.

435
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,623
Twenty-two years, eight in London.

436
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:22,418
Really? I love London.

437
00:23:22,517 --> 00:23:24,724
Greatest city in the world,
aside from Omaha.

438
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,260
We should all go there.

439
00:23:26,922 --> 00:23:28,094
Well...

440
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:30,033
So you're no longer in demolition?

441
00:23:30,692 --> 00:23:32,729
- What happened?
- The business blew up.

442
00:23:35,264 --> 00:23:37,369
Completely collapsed. Demolished.

443
00:23:38,433 --> 00:23:39,571
What are you doing now?

444
00:23:39,701 --> 00:23:41,874
You know,
I got something pretty good brewin'.

445
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:46,416
I'm so glad you sat us with,
you know, Sam's parents.

446
00:23:46,875 --> 00:23:49,617
Was that Pramilla's sister in the pink sari?

447
00:23:49,711 --> 00:23:51,384
I know. Gorgeous.

448
00:23:51,446 --> 00:23:54,154
What have you got "brewin'"?

449
00:23:55,384 --> 00:23:57,125
Well, we don't want
to steal your thunder today,

450
00:23:57,219 --> 00:24:00,428
you know, 'cause that was
one heck of a wedding you put on,

451
00:24:00,889 --> 00:24:04,132
but since you're family
I gotta spill the beans.

452
00:24:04,226 --> 00:24:07,298
No, I thought we'd wait until tomorrow.

453
00:24:07,396 --> 00:24:08,807
We're opening an English pub.

454
00:24:12,067 --> 00:24:13,512
Where... Who's opening a pub?

455
00:24:15,237 --> 00:24:16,272
In England, is that.

456
00:24:16,672 --> 00:24:19,346
In Omaha! Me and Penny.

457
00:24:19,441 --> 00:24:20,511
I'm sorry. What?

458
00:24:20,609 --> 00:24:23,488
Wait a minute. Penny.
You're not leaving the newspaper?

459
00:24:23,578 --> 00:24:27,287
Well, [was about to be laid off,
and so I took the buyout.

460
00:24:27,349 --> 00:24:28,987
At least they'll pay me for a year.

461
00:24:29,084 --> 00:24:30,290
How could you not tell me this?

462
00:24:30,352 --> 00:24:32,298
Do you know there's not one English pub
in Omaha?

463
00:24:32,354 --> 00:24:35,096
If you want bangers and mash,
you got to go all the way to Des Moines.

464
00:24:35,691 --> 00:24:37,500
Really? Who's financing this?

465
00:24:37,592 --> 00:24:40,129
You know, finally, you'll be able
to get a decent pint in Nebraska,

466
00:24:40,195 --> 00:24:42,698
and fish and chips, I mean, the real thing,

467
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:44,800
in newspaper, soaked with grease.

468
00:24:44,866 --> 00:24:45,867
And...

469
00:24:45,967 --> 00:24:47,344
- Excuse me.
- I'm sorry.

470
00:24:47,436 --> 00:24:49,006
No, it's okay. Don't worry.

471
00:24:49,771 --> 00:24:51,876
This is genius, if I do say so myself.

472
00:24:51,973 --> 00:24:53,850
It'll be the only place in the Midwest,
that I know of,

473
00:24:53,942 --> 00:24:55,615
where you can have... Are you ready?

474
00:24:55,677 --> 00:24:57,122
Warm beer.

475
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:00,451
Wow. Warm beer.

476
00:25:00,515 --> 00:25:01,516
Yeah.

477
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:04,290
Where's the money coming from?

478
00:25:04,353 --> 00:25:05,559
Bottom-line guy, Bryan.

479
00:25:05,654 --> 00:25:07,133
You got that from your mother.

480
00:25:07,189 --> 00:25:08,293
First thing Penny asked me.

481
00:25:08,357 --> 00:25:09,358
Good. What'd you tell her?

482
00:25:09,458 --> 00:25:12,029
Well, I got some money saved,
and I sold my condo.

483
00:25:12,127 --> 00:25:15,904
And I got a friend whose brother
wants to put up half the money,

484
00:25:15,997 --> 00:25:17,237
after we raise the first half.

485
00:25:17,332 --> 00:25:19,868
And, you know,
we're talking to other investors.

486
00:25:19,967 --> 00:25:22,504
Okay, what are you contributing to this?

487
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:24,880
Not one cent, if Russell has his way.

488
00:25:25,172 --> 00:25:27,482
- Nothing?
- That's right. Nothing.

489
00:25:28,209 --> 00:25:30,211
Look, I mean, of course,

490
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:35,821
we may dip into my buyout
until we have some cash flow.

491
00:25:44,658 --> 00:25:46,501
And Russell's moving in,
so we won't have that expense.

492
00:25:47,194 --> 00:25:48,502
Penny's enrolled in a bartending class.

493
00:25:49,997 --> 00:25:51,499
Mom.

494
00:25:52,099 --> 00:25:56,275
We want to give all of you the opportunity
to get in on the ground floor.

495
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:58,714
How would you like to all be par!- owners

496
00:25:58,773 --> 00:26:00,343
of the Partridge and the Plough?

497
00:26:05,579 --> 00:26:07,388
Mom, are you serious?

498
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:11,193
Yeah?

499
00:26:11,685 --> 00:26:14,894
Wait, wait. He's canceling on me

500
00:26:14,955 --> 00:26:16,593
so that he can have
the surgery done by Ed Ritter?

501
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:18,101
Does he know I trained Ed Ritten?

502
00:26:18,392 --> 00:26:20,372
Ruthie, tell me his exact words.

503
00:26:23,197 --> 00:26:25,108
Really?

504
00:26:25,199 --> 00:26:27,440
"Surgeons reach their peak at 45"?

505
00:26:27,535 --> 00:26:29,037
Who told him that?

506
00:26:35,109 --> 00:26:36,281
Freeway! Shit!

507
00:26:36,377 --> 00:26:39,221
I got to go, Ruthie. I'll see you Monday.

508
00:26:41,649 --> 00:26:44,630
Freeway!

509
00:26:47,721 --> 00:26:49,223
Freeway!

510
00:26:53,394 --> 00:26:54,896
Hi, Ellie called.

511
00:26:54,962 --> 00:26:56,305
They got your mother on her plane.

512
00:26:56,397 --> 00:26:58,809
And you know what? Ethan asked about you.

513
00:26:58,899 --> 00:27:01,607
You know what he said? He is so cute.

514
00:27:01,669 --> 00:27:03,808
He said, "Where's Pee-Pee?"

515
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:10,115
Honey, what are we going to do
about the Partridge and the Plough?

516
00:27:10,578 --> 00:27:11,989
- What are we going to do about Russell?
- I don't know.

517
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:13,114
Has Freeway been in here?

518
00:27:13,447 --> 00:27:14,790
I thought he was with you.

519
00:27:15,249 --> 00:27:17,422
He was, but he took off on me.

520
00:27:17,818 --> 00:27:19,957
What? Wait a minute. Where's the dog?

521
00:27:20,588 --> 00:27:21,532
I told you. He took off.

522
00:27:21,622 --> 00:27:22,999
When was this?

523
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:24,125
About 20 minutes ago.

524
00:27:24,325 --> 00:27:25,861
He chased a deer and wouldn't come back.

525
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,031
Did you use the whistle?

526
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:29,163
I whistled.

527
00:27:29,263 --> 00:27:31,766
I didn't have the whistle, per se.

528
00:27:31,832 --> 00:27:34,210
You were on the phone, right?

529
00:27:34,301 --> 00:27:35,336
It was an emergency.

530
00:27:35,436 --> 00:27:36,608
God.

531
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:38,775
He's probably right outside.

532
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,046
Freeway! Come on, boy!

533
00:27:44,445 --> 00:27:46,686
Freeway!

534
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:50,227
Where are you, sweetheart?

535
00:27:50,317 --> 00:27:53,696
You lost the dog
while you were talking on the phone!

536
00:27:55,656 --> 00:27:56,794
Freeway!

537
00:27:57,958 --> 00:28:00,199
He's not lost, believe me.

538
00:28:01,462 --> 00:28:02,839
Freeway!

539
00:28:04,331 --> 00:28:06,140
- He knows how to get home.
- Freeway!

540
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,975
Is something wrong?

541
00:28:08,969 --> 00:28:09,970
The dog's run off.

542
00:28:10,571 --> 00:28:12,346
Shit. We'll be right there.

543
00:28:12,406 --> 00:28:13,714
Yeah, be right there.

544
00:28:14,375 --> 00:28:17,652
Dogs find their way across the country
all the time. Haven't you read that?

545
00:28:18,979 --> 00:28:20,652
Freeway!

546
00:28:20,714 --> 00:28:21,920
<i>Is Freeway missing?</i>

547
00:28:22,016 --> 00:28:24,929
Yes, we've got to spread out
and search before it's too dark.

548
00:28:25,019 --> 00:28:26,225
I'll get the keys.

549
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,095
- Freeway!
- You're panicking.

550
00:28:28,188 --> 00:28:30,225
Don't you know how much
that dog means to me?

551
00:28:30,324 --> 00:28:33,237
Yes, of course I do. I like him too.
I'm just not obsessed with him.

552
00:28:33,327 --> 00:28:35,398
How could you be,
when you're obsessed with yourself?

553
00:28:35,996 --> 00:28:38,203
- Where'd you see him last?
- On the back trail.

554
00:28:38,265 --> 00:28:39,744
- Wait, the dog's gone?
- Yeah'

555
00:28:39,833 --> 00:28:40,903
Come on, let's go.

556
00:28:41,001 --> 00:28:42,344
I'm with you. Where should we start looking?

557
00:28:42,403 --> 00:28:43,848
Okay, we'll go this way.

558
00:28:44,038 --> 00:28:46,075
I'm gonna go out to the road
and look around.

559
00:28:46,674 --> 00:28:48,051
I got a light. I'll come with you.

560
00:28:49,443 --> 00:28:51,719
Wait, wait, wait, wait! Use your whistle!

561
00:28:52,746 --> 00:28:53,918
Hi!

562
00:28:54,014 --> 00:28:55,357
Okay.

563
00:28:59,186 --> 00:29:00,597
Here, boy!

564
00:29:00,688 --> 00:29:02,258
- Careful.
- Shoot.

565
00:29:02,356 --> 00:29:04,768
Bryan thinks I should have my knee scoped.

566
00:29:04,858 --> 00:29:07,304
Yeah, I've been begging you
to do that for years,

567
00:29:07,394 --> 00:29:10,637
You can't fix a torn meniscus
with herbal enemas.

568
00:29:11,198 --> 00:29:15,613
You know, Bryan's much more open
to Eastern approaches.

569
00:29:15,703 --> 00:29:19,480
And it's colonics, not enemas.

570
00:29:19,573 --> 00:29:23,578
You should try one.
It might dislodge that enormous bug.

571
00:29:23,811 --> 00:29:26,291
- What?
- You're so negative about Russell.

572
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:29,054
Don't you think we've given
the pub a lot of thought?

573
00:29:29,149 --> 00:29:30,822
The Pig and the Poke? No.

574
00:29:30,918 --> 00:29:32,625
What are you doing with this guy?

575
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,791
Just because
your first husband was a genius

576
00:29:34,888 --> 00:29:37,630
and he turned out to be a dick
doesn't mean you can never trust

577
00:29:37,725 --> 00:29:39,136
another man with half a brain.

578
00:29:39,226 --> 00:29:40,830
You're the dumb one.

579
00:29:40,928 --> 00:29:43,272
Have you ever heard
of emotional intelligence?

580
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:46,573
You know, Russell makes you
look like a five-year-old.

581
00:29:46,667 --> 00:29:49,648
Plus, he's the most generous lover
I've ever known.

582
00:29:49,737 --> 00:29:52,013
Stop. Spare me that image.

583
00:29:54,174 --> 00:29:57,621
Freeway, come back,
you son of a bitch bastard!

584
00:30:00,447 --> 00:30:02,256
Your girlfriend,
she didn't come to the wedding.

585
00:30:02,616 --> 00:30:04,596
Doesn't she like Grace?

586
00:30:04,652 --> 00:30:07,826
Violet likes Grace just fine.
She had to go on a retreat with her firm.

587
00:30:07,921 --> 00:30:09,264
A retreat?

588
00:30:09,323 --> 00:30:12,429
Yeah, they all go away somewhere
and talk about IPOs, government regulations.

589
00:30:12,493 --> 00:30:14,973
- To avoid the regulations?
- Yeah.

590
00:30:15,029 --> 00:30:18,306
No, how to comply with them, sort of.

591
00:30:18,365 --> 00:30:21,642
Anyway, it's my mother
that is hard on Violet.

592
00:30:21,702 --> 00:30:24,876
She says you can't trust a woman
who wears four inch heels all the time.

593
00:30:24,972 --> 00:30:26,713
All the time?

594
00:30:26,807 --> 00:30:28,218
She looks good in them.

595
00:30:29,109 --> 00:30:30,952
My mother says, "What's she selling?"

596
00:30:33,981 --> 00:30:36,120
I have an idea. Wait.

597
00:30:43,891 --> 00:30:45,893
- Come on, boy.
- Hey, buddy!

598
00:30:45,993 --> 00:30:48,337
I'm just so pissed
he didn't take the whistle.

599
00:30:48,395 --> 00:30:50,705
Joseph's got a lot on his mind
with the wedding

600
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:52,641
and then our news
about the Partridge and the Plough.

601
00:30:52,866 --> 00:30:55,244
Trust me, he wasn't thinking about you
or the wedding.

602
00:30:55,335 --> 00:30:57,246
If you want his attention,
herniate your disk.

603
00:30:57,337 --> 00:31:00,216
- Hey, buddy!
- Hey, guys, stop talking about Joseph!

604
00:31:00,307 --> 00:31:01,877
We can hear you!

605
00:31:01,975 --> 00:31:03,852
We could use a little help here.

606
00:31:03,911 --> 00:31:05,982
- Wait a second.
- Her knee, her knee.

607
00:31:06,046 --> 00:31:07,650
- Get some ice on this
- Don't. Your back...

608
00:31:07,815 --> 00:31:10,159
- It's nothing. It's nothing.
- This way.

609
00:31:10,217 --> 00:31:12,823
- What did you do...
- Honey, it's my knee.

610
00:31:13,687 --> 00:31:15,667
What are you looking at?

611
00:31:24,031 --> 00:31:25,203
It's 10:00,

612
00:31:25,265 --> 00:31:29,577
and you are deep
in Possum's Burrow on KGO-FM.

613
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:33,174
Coming up, we have Blue
by the Living Sisters.

614
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:45,796
Hello, big bear!

615
00:31:45,886 --> 00:31:47,695
Oh, my God.

616
00:31:47,755 --> 00:31:49,029
Woof!

617
00:31:49,256 --> 00:31:50,462
Possum!

618
00:31:53,193 --> 00:31:54,604
Wow.

619
00:31:54,695 --> 00:31:58,768
You know, I had a dream last night
that you were gonna come down here.

620
00:31:58,866 --> 00:32:00,402
I need a favor.

621
00:32:00,467 --> 00:32:02,140
Anything, darling.

622
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:05,372
What's this, fresh meat?

623
00:32:05,706 --> 00:32:07,048
I'm Bryan.

624
00:32:09,041 --> 00:32:11,043
Bryan.

625
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:13,386
Are you ready to have your heart broke, man?

626
00:32:15,248 --> 00:32:16,488
She's legendary.

627
00:32:16,582 --> 00:32:19,426
Possum, my boss lost her dog.

628
00:32:22,255 --> 00:32:23,598
I'm on it.

629
00:32:24,423 --> 00:32:27,495
<i>All right, everybody,
I got a friend who needs our help.</i>

630
00:32:27,593 --> 00:32:29,231
<i>She's looking for a lost dog,</i>

631
00:32:29,662 --> 00:32:31,903
big brown-white mutt,

632
00:32:31,964 --> 00:32:33,910
means about as much to his people as...

633
00:32:34,233 --> 00:32:36,406
<i>Carmen means to me.</i>

634
00:32:36,469 --> 00:32:38,312
Get to the point, Possum.

635
00:32:38,404 --> 00:32:40,179
<i>Dog's name is Freeway.</i>

636
00:32:40,273 --> 00:32:43,743
<i>So everybody step outside
and give a big shout-out for Freeway.</i>

637
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:46,689
<i>There's a cash reward, if that matters.</i>

638
00:32:48,915 --> 00:32:50,087
Here you go.

639
00:32:50,149 --> 00:32:52,686
Now, you need to keep that elevated.

640
00:32:52,785 --> 00:32:54,458
And I want you to take these.

641
00:32:55,288 --> 00:32:56,323
What are they?

642
00:32:56,422 --> 00:32:59,767
It's a mild anti-inflammatory
and a muscle relaxant

643
00:33:00,493 --> 00:33:01,836
They're organic.

644
00:33:01,928 --> 00:33:04,272
Made from the hearts of endangered species.

645
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:07,311
You know I don't take chemicals
into my body.

646
00:33:07,366 --> 00:33:09,141
You want to be laid up here
by yourself tomorrow

647
00:33:09,202 --> 00:33:12,012
while we're all out looking for the dog?

648
00:33:22,515 --> 00:33:23,823
Say, "Aah. "

649
00:33:27,053 --> 00:33:28,396
Thank you.

650
00:33:30,456 --> 00:33:31,628
<i>New remember, everybody,</i>

651
00:33:31,791 --> 00:33:34,135
<i>if you see Freeway, call this number...</i>

652
00:33:34,994 --> 00:33:36,496
<i>He dedicated Searching to you.</i>

653
00:33:36,796 --> 00:33:38,139
Which one?

654
00:33:38,664 --> 00:33:39,665
Erykah Badu.

655
00:33:41,334 --> 00:33:42,335
Nice.

656
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:00,758
It's gonna be fine.
He'll probably show up in the morning.

657
00:34:00,853 --> 00:34:03,834
He's out there with coyotes
and bears and porcupines.

658
00:34:04,156 --> 00:34:06,158
But he's a dog. He can take care of himself.

659
00:34:06,325 --> 00:34:08,327
But he has no wilderness experience.

660
00:34:11,497 --> 00:34:12,999
Beth, I think you're overreacting.

661
00:34:13,065 --> 00:34:17,343
I think you're under-reacting,
for somebody who actually lost the dog.

662
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:20,717
You know, I'm so sick of you
judging my feelings all the time!

663
00:34:20,773 --> 00:34:22,377
Wouldn't want to be sleeping
with her tonight.

664
00:34:23,542 --> 00:34:25,579
They are out of alignment.

665
00:34:34,854 --> 00:34:37,767
No, the dog is definitely not black.

666
00:34:38,724 --> 00:34:41,705
No, I do not want to come and check him out.

667
00:34:43,596 --> 00:34:45,269
Possum had to mention my name.

668
00:34:45,631 --> 00:34:47,372
Well, maybe we'll find him at the shelter.

669
00:34:47,433 --> 00:34:48,707
It's a wasted trip.

670
00:34:49,201 --> 00:34:50,805
Freeway is not there.

671
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:52,074
How do you know?

672
00:34:53,739 --> 00:34:54,877
I know things.

673
00:34:55,541 --> 00:34:56,884
You know things?

674
00:34:56,943 --> 00:34:58,115
Like, what do you know?

675
00:34:59,612 --> 00:35:02,058
I know Russell would like to be your friend.

676
00:35:03,582 --> 00:35:06,563
Well, yeah, of course he would. He's
trying to close the deal with my mother.

677
00:35:07,987 --> 00:35:11,730
And I know you were glad
Violet did not come to the wedding.

678
00:35:19,231 --> 00:35:20,767
Excuse me. We've lost our dog.

679
00:35:20,833 --> 00:35:22,835
Is there a report we can fill out?

680
00:35:24,236 --> 00:35:25,738
Well, how long's the dog been missing?

681
00:35:26,272 --> 00:35:27,410
Since last night.

682
00:35:28,908 --> 00:35:31,912
Well, old Pipe here,
he'll take off for three days

683
00:35:31,978 --> 00:35:34,652
anytime some bitch goes into heat.

684
00:35:34,747 --> 00:35:37,250
He can smell 'em from five miles out.

685
00:35:38,484 --> 00:35:40,964
That's really fascinating.
Our dog is neutered.

686
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,293
Yeah, could you put word out
to your deputies?

687
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:46,033
You'd have to talk to
the Sheriff about that.

688
00:35:46,926 --> 00:35:48,098
And how could we reach him?

689
00:35:49,128 --> 00:35:51,039
- The Sheriff?
- Yeah!

690
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:54,434
He's probably fishing down by Slater's.

691
00:36:09,648 --> 00:36:10,786
Hey, what's going on?

692
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:13,194
This is where I found Django.

693
00:36:13,285 --> 00:36:14,491
Django died last year.

694
00:36:14,553 --> 00:36:16,032
Your dog?

695
00:36:16,122 --> 00:36:18,500
And spirit-mate.

696
00:36:18,557 --> 00:36:19,831
Passed over in my arms.

697
00:36:20,793 --> 00:36:22,295
I'm sorry.

698
00:36:22,628 --> 00:36:23,971
He was 24 years old.

699
00:36:25,464 --> 00:36:28,138
It's unusual for a dog to live that long.

700
00:36:32,171 --> 00:36:33,377
What?

701
00:36:43,682 --> 00:36:45,423
Good-bye, little boy.

702
00:36:45,518 --> 00:36:47,725
I know.

703
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:50,494
Good-bye, beautiful boy.

704
00:36:50,556 --> 00:36:53,400
I know someone will come for you.

705
00:36:53,492 --> 00:36:55,563
A spirit-mate?

706
00:36:55,661 --> 00:36:57,732
No. He's waiting for a man.

707
00:36:59,598 --> 00:37:01,271
Joseph, you're a doctor.

708
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,407
Is it my imagination,

709
00:37:03,502 --> 00:37:06,608
or does your dick shrink
when you get older?

710
00:37:08,007 --> 00:37:09,077
When you say "your dick"...

711
00:37:09,175 --> 00:37:12,384
No, mature dicks, in general, dicks.

712
00:37:15,047 --> 00:37:16,754
I think I see him.

713
00:37:23,689 --> 00:37:25,362
Hey! Sheriff!

714
00:37:26,926 --> 00:37:29,600
- Joseph Winter. Could we talk?
- Who?

715
00:37:30,396 --> 00:37:32,034
Joseph Winter.

716
00:37:32,698 --> 00:37:35,702
Well, look, tomorrow's Monday.

717
00:37:35,768 --> 00:37:37,611
I'll be in the office all day, Joe.

718
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:40,908
Yeah, no, I understand.
I'm sorry about that, but it's an emergency.

719
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:46,713
You're the doctor, right? Who's that?

720
00:37:47,379 --> 00:37:49,723
- Future brother-in-law.
- Nobody.

721
00:37:50,716 --> 00:37:52,389
Well, what's the emergency, Joe?

722
00:37:52,918 --> 00:37:54,556
We lost our dog.

723
00:37:55,321 --> 00:37:58,461
Yeah, actually, they call me Joseph,

724
00:37:58,557 --> 00:38:00,298
which I prefer.

725
00:38:00,392 --> 00:38:03,430
His wife talked to your deputy,
but she didn't get too far.

726
00:38:03,496 --> 00:38:06,409
Yeah, that'd be Chaz.
He wants my job, you know,

727
00:38:06,465 --> 00:38:09,674
if it didn't interfere with ski season
or hunting season

728
00:38:09,768 --> 00:38:11,145
or getting drunk season.

729
00:38:11,237 --> 00:38:12,773
What kind of dog did you lose?

730
00:38:13,339 --> 00:38:15,148
A mutt. My wife rescued him.

731
00:38:15,241 --> 00:38:16,447
A what?

732
00:38:16,509 --> 00:38:17,920
A mutt!

733
00:38:19,478 --> 00:38:20,980
Look, let me come over there,

734
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,582
and you can talk to me
on my good ear, okay?

735
00:38:23,315 --> 00:38:24,953
This is my day off!

736
00:38:25,017 --> 00:38:27,122
Yeah, yeah, I realize that.

737
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:33,832
This all happened on the freeway, did it?
In the snow?

738
00:38:34,593 --> 00:38:35,970
In January.

739
00:38:36,996 --> 00:38:39,670
Well, your wife must have some brass balls
I'm telling you.

740
00:38:40,266 --> 00:38:43,179
And your daughter,
she married the veterinarian, did she?

741
00:38:43,269 --> 00:38:45,112
Yesterday, at our place.

742
00:38:45,604 --> 00:38:47,277
Well, congratulations.

743
00:38:47,339 --> 00:38:49,114
Thank you.

744
00:38:49,175 --> 00:38:50,950
Hope they're happy.

745
00:38:52,678 --> 00:38:54,282
What is it? Where does it hurt?

746
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,449
Kidney stone.

747
00:38:56,514 --> 00:38:58,187
Okay, let's get you to a clinic.

748
00:38:58,283 --> 00:39:00,160
No, I can move. I can...

749
00:39:01,286 --> 00:39:02,890
Okay, you get this side.

750
00:39:02,987 --> 00:39:03,988
Okay.

751
00:39:04,155 --> 00:39:05,862
I can make it! I can make it I can make it.

752
00:39:05,957 --> 00:39:07,527
Don't get hung up on the hook here.

753
00:39:07,959 --> 00:39:09,529
Come on, boy. Come on.

754
00:39:09,627 --> 00:39:11,038
- Bring my dogs.
- Come on. I got 'em.

755
00:39:11,129 --> 00:39:12,472
- Bring my dogs!
- I will.

756
00:39:14,465 --> 00:39:16,308
Gettin' old really sucks, Joe.

757
00:39:16,868 --> 00:39:19,007
You're not old. What are you, 60?

758
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:20,879
63.

759
00:39:20,972 --> 00:39:23,748
My fifth goddamn stone.

760
00:39:23,841 --> 00:39:25,252
Maybe this one will pass quickly.

761
00:39:26,144 --> 00:39:29,489
Maybe it'll be over in time
for my colonoscopy next week.

762
00:39:30,248 --> 00:39:32,091
You wouldn't want to miss that.

763
00:39:32,483 --> 00:39:33,553
You're a doctor.

764
00:39:33,651 --> 00:39:36,188
Why don't you come up
with a better way to do that?

765
00:39:36,254 --> 00:39:37,426
I'd make a fortune.

766
00:39:39,057 --> 00:39:40,400
I don't want to be insulting,

767
00:39:40,491 --> 00:39:42,903
but just... Man, you just...

768
00:39:44,762 --> 00:39:46,605
What's your PSA?

769
00:39:46,698 --> 00:39:48,268
1.2.

770
00:39:48,366 --> 00:39:49,868
You're lucky.

771
00:39:51,836 --> 00:39:54,043
How's your good cholesterol?

772
00:39:54,105 --> 00:39:55,516
I only have bad.

773
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,849
What kind of doctor are you?

774
00:39:57,909 --> 00:39:59,513
Spine surgeon.

775
00:40:01,112 --> 00:40:04,389
When do they start
pushing you out of that deal?

776
00:40:07,852 --> 00:40:09,354
- Let's boogie, Joe.
- Okay.

777
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:10,421
Clinic!

778
00:40:10,521 --> 00:40:11,591
- Got you.
- Hammer down.

779
00:40:20,098 --> 00:40:21,543
Hey.

780
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,440
Come on, Beth, let's go inside.

781
00:40:24,102 --> 00:40:25,706
Come on.

782
00:40:31,876 --> 00:40:32,980
It's getting chilly.

783
00:40:33,444 --> 00:40:34,889
Well, the dog.

784
00:40:41,052 --> 00:40:43,054
There's a place for you if you're hungry.

785
00:40:43,221 --> 00:40:44,996
Beth, you should eat something.

786
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:51,563
Freeway is gonna show up, Beth.

787
00:40:53,665 --> 00:40:55,338
He has the microchip. He has the collar.

788
00:40:55,433 --> 00:40:56,605
We've got flyers everywhere.

789
00:40:56,901 --> 00:40:58,744
It's about the only thing
playing on the radio.

790
00:40:59,003 --> 00:41:02,075
They're getting complaints from people
who'd like to hear a little music.

791
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,642
We've done everything we can.

792
00:41:03,741 --> 00:41:05,652
Someone will find him and call.

793
00:41:06,277 --> 00:41:07,984
Let's talk about tomorrow.

794
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:09,649
My first appointments at 11:00

795
00:41:09,747 --> 00:41:12,193
and Bryan has rounds starting at noon.

796
00:41:12,283 --> 00:41:13,762
So that means Beth, Bryan and I

797
00:41:13,918 --> 00:41:16,660
have to leave for the airport
no later than 6:30.

798
00:41:16,754 --> 00:41:19,860
Penny, Carmen can drive you guys
to the airport later on.

799
00:41:19,957 --> 00:41:21,027
I'm not leaving.

800
00:41:24,495 --> 00:41:26,099
Honey, what are you gonna do?

801
00:41:26,264 --> 00:41:28,301
You can't walk around all day
calling his name.

802
00:41:28,533 --> 00:41:29,671
I'm up for another day.

803
00:41:29,934 --> 00:41:31,436
We're not leaving Beth up here alone.

804
00:41:31,602 --> 00:41:34,481
I'm not saying to leave Beth alone.

805
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:36,619
Look, I think that's great.

806
00:41:36,674 --> 00:41:38,984
If you guys feel you can stay, that's cool.

807
00:41:39,043 --> 00:41:40,522
That's fine. Yeah.

808
00:41:40,611 --> 00:41:42,682
It's very nice of you.

809
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,782
The world goes on, though. Bryan and I,

810
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:48,297
we do have responsibilities to get back to.

811
00:41:49,987 --> 00:41:51,364
I'm trying to be realistic.

812
00:41:51,456 --> 00:41:54,403
What, that makes me the insensitive clod?

813
00:41:54,492 --> 00:41:55,869
Yes,

814
00:41:56,461 --> 00:41:58,065
Would you be leaving if I were missing?

815
00:41:58,529 --> 00:42:00,736
That's ridiculous. It's nothing like that.

816
00:42:00,865 --> 00:42:03,004
- Would you?
- I'm not even gonna dignify that.

817
00:42:03,468 --> 00:42:06,074
- Dignify it.
- Beth, everything is a crisis with you.

818
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:07,843
There's no sense of proportion.

819
00:42:08,339 --> 00:42:09,647
You just don't get it, do you?

820
00:42:10,141 --> 00:42:12,314
What? What is it I don't get?

821
00:42:12,377 --> 00:42:14,880
We haven't lost a person. We've lost a dog.

822
00:42:14,979 --> 00:42:15,980
Love is love.

823
00:42:16,481 --> 00:42:18,188
It doesn't matter if it's a dog.

824
00:42:18,549 --> 00:42:20,688
Yeah, I know you love the dog
You don't think I've noticed

825
00:42:20,752 --> 00:42:22,390
that you care more about him
than you do about me?

826
00:42:22,487 --> 00:42:25,058
Jesus, Joseph, I don't believe
you're making this about you.

827
00:42:25,156 --> 00:42:26,191
Mom.

828
00:42:28,059 --> 00:42:29,197
When I rescued Freeway,

829
00:42:30,528 --> 00:42:33,099
I made a promise to him and to myself

830
00:42:33,197 --> 00:42:35,438
that I was gonna take care of him.

831
00:42:35,533 --> 00:42:37,672
He'd suffered enough already,

832
00:42:37,735 --> 00:42:39,681
and I wanted to make it up to him.

833
00:42:39,737 --> 00:42:42,047
But now I've let him down.

834
00:42:42,407 --> 00:42:43,784
How? How have you let him down?

835
00:42:44,175 --> 00:42:46,018
I never should have let you take him out.

836
00:42:47,211 --> 00:42:49,555
I have walked that dog 100 times.

837
00:42:49,714 --> 00:42:53,389
I know.
On a leash, around the block, in the city,

838
00:42:53,451 --> 00:42:54,930
while you were talking on your phone.

839
00:42:55,019 --> 00:42:57,021
I thought Freeway was our dog.

840
00:42:57,422 --> 00:42:59,026
You never paid attention to him.

841
00:42:59,424 --> 00:43:01,028
You know more about your patients

842
00:43:01,092 --> 00:43:02,730
than you do about your own family.

843
00:43:03,628 --> 00:43:05,767
I'm not having this conversation now.

844
00:43:05,863 --> 00:43:07,035
You're irrational.

845
00:43:07,098 --> 00:43:10,272
I would have had that whistle,

846
00:43:10,368 --> 00:43:12,245
and he would have come back to me.

847
00:43:12,303 --> 00:43:13,907
But now he's gone.

848
00:43:13,971 --> 00:43:16,474
And for all I know,
he may be suffering somewhere.

849
00:43:16,574 --> 00:43:19,214
He's probably terrified.
I don't know. He may be dead.

850
00:43:20,778 --> 00:43:22,155
He's not dead.

851
00:43:23,247 --> 00:43:25,557
- Freeway is alive.
- What?

852
00:43:26,117 --> 00:43:27,289
What are you talking about?

853
00:43:29,487 --> 00:43:31,330
I am certain he's alive.

854
00:43:31,422 --> 00:43:33,766
You're certain?

855
00:43:33,825 --> 00:43:37,068
I never told you this, but I find things.

856
00:43:38,463 --> 00:43:39,464
What kind of things?

857
00:43:39,964 --> 00:43:41,944
Missing things. Sometimes living things.

858
00:43:41,999 --> 00:43:43,069
You mean like a detective?

859
00:43:43,301 --> 00:43:45,508
My great-great-grandmother was
Madame Luminitsa.

860
00:43:45,603 --> 00:43:46,741
You've probably heard of her.

861
00:43:51,108 --> 00:43:52,519
I am of the Romany people.

862
00:43:52,777 --> 00:43:53,983
Gypsies?

863
00:43:54,078 --> 00:43:55,421
On my mother's side.

864
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:57,118
My father is a yogi.

865
00:43:57,181 --> 00:43:59,422
The women in my family, they have a gift.

866
00:43:59,984 --> 00:44:01,122
We see things.

867
00:44:02,753 --> 00:44:04,198
You find it hard to believe.

868
00:44:04,288 --> 00:44:05,596
<i>Gadje always do.</i>

869
00:44:05,756 --> 00:44:07,099
But I can help you find Freeway.

870
00:44:07,692 --> 00:44:08,830
<i>Gadje?</i>

871
00:44:09,427 --> 00:44:10,701
How?

872
00:44:16,501 --> 00:44:20,210
When I realized Django was my spirit-mate,

873
00:44:20,304 --> 00:44:22,511
the animal world became visible to me.

874
00:44:22,607 --> 00:44:24,211
As opposed to the vegetable
and mineral worlds?

875
00:44:24,308 --> 00:44:25,685
Now, who's Django?

876
00:44:26,143 --> 00:44:28,180
That was Carmen's dog. He lived to be 24.

877
00:44:28,946 --> 00:44:31,517
It was then that the gift blossomed in me.

878
00:44:31,616 --> 00:44:33,687
My third eye truly opened.

879
00:44:33,784 --> 00:44:35,695
What Django felt, I felt.

880
00:44:35,786 --> 00:44:38,960
I traveled through the world with him,
seeing what he saw.

881
00:44:39,023 --> 00:44:40,127
And what did he see?

882
00:44:40,525 --> 00:44:42,801
He saw things for what they are.

883
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:44,498
He was connected to the prana.

884
00:44:45,029 --> 00:44:46,133
<i>The prana.</i>

885
00:44:46,197 --> 00:44:48,404
Shut up, Joseph. You're such a tight ass.

886
00:44:48,499 --> 00:44:50,137
Do you have to be so one-dimensional?

887
00:44:50,301 --> 00:44:52,406
Excuse me for living in this dimension.

888
00:44:52,503 --> 00:44:53,573
Carmen.

889
00:44:54,005 --> 00:44:55,313
Do you see him? is he all right?

890
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:56,917
Beth, are you kidding me?

891
00:44:57,708 --> 00:44:59,244
Can you see what he sees?

892
00:45:01,412 --> 00:45:03,323
- Yes.
- What do you see?

893
00:45:04,215 --> 00:45:05,319
I see trees

894
00:45:06,050 --> 00:45:09,998
and a shed with construction equipment in it
and mountains.

895
00:45:12,089 --> 00:45:14,330
Wow. That really pinpoints it.

896
00:45:15,493 --> 00:45:17,166
I see a redheaded woman.

897
00:45:17,662 --> 00:45:19,767
What, Freeway's looking
at a redheaded woman?

898
00:45:19,997 --> 00:45:21,704
She may have fed him.

899
00:45:21,766 --> 00:45:23,871
He had some kind of interaction with her.

900
00:45:24,435 --> 00:45:25,573
What should we do?

901
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:27,240
Yeah.

902
00:45:27,338 --> 00:45:29,443
Go to bed.

903
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:31,918
What, are you closing for the night?

904
00:45:32,009 --> 00:45:34,546
In the morning,
everything will be much clearer.

905
00:45:34,612 --> 00:45:37,218
I need rest. And so do you.

906
00:45:40,685 --> 00:45:42,028
Wail,

907
00:45:52,028 --> 00:45:54,599
How long are we supposed to wait?

908
00:45:57,567 --> 00:45:59,638
This is Freeway's hair.

909
00:46:02,572 --> 00:46:05,052
Keep this close to your heart.

910
00:46:06,543 --> 00:46:08,045
Freeway will feel our concern.

911
00:46:08,111 --> 00:46:09,556
Are we supposed to sleep with this?

912
00:46:09,713 --> 00:46:10,748
Makes sense to me.

913
00:46:13,817 --> 00:46:15,797
Could I have mine in a baggie?

914
00:46:15,885 --> 00:46:17,455
- Sure.
- Thanks.

915
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:26,564
Carmen, why are you getting her hopes up?

916
00:46:28,064 --> 00:46:29,634
Gypsy trick.

917
00:46:29,733 --> 00:46:31,474
So you're leaving in the morning,
aren't you?

918
00:46:31,568 --> 00:46:32,638
I have to. I'd stay if I could.

919
00:46:32,902 --> 00:46:34,108
Violet is expecting you.

920
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:36,912
No, not Violet. I have patients to see.

921
00:46:39,409 --> 00:46:41,150
My people have a saying.

922
00:46:41,244 --> 00:46:43,121
"Those who don't push the caravan
from the muck

923
00:46:43,179 --> 00:46:44,749
"become one with the muck,"

924
00:46:46,249 --> 00:46:48,855
Thank you. That's very understanding.

925
00:46:52,622 --> 00:46:54,101
Good-bye.

926
00:47:01,698 --> 00:47:02,699
Beth, what are you doing?

927
00:47:02,799 --> 00:47:05,507
I'm looking for those night-vision glasses
I got you for Christmas,

928
00:47:05,602 --> 00:47:07,172
They're probably still in the same box.

929
00:47:07,270 --> 00:47:08,840
Beth, you have to get some rest.

930
00:47:08,938 --> 00:47:11,282
You heard Miss Luminitska.

931
00:47:11,341 --> 00:47:12,376
Let me get you a Xanax.

932
00:47:12,475 --> 00:47:13,545
You think it's impossible

933
00:47:13,643 --> 00:47:15,623
Carmen might actually know
something you don't?

934
00:47:15,812 --> 00:47:17,723
About Freeway? Doubtful.

935
00:47:17,814 --> 00:47:19,020
Unless she kidnapped him.

936
00:47:19,282 --> 00:47:21,694
She's given me hope. Maybe she has a gift.
And unlike you,

937
00:47:21,785 --> 00:47:24,129
I don't think
I know everything about everything.

938
00:47:24,487 --> 00:47:27,366
Why are you turning on me?
I didn't commit a crime.

939
00:47:27,624 --> 00:47:30,161
There are a few pivotal moments
in a person's life,

940
00:47:30,226 --> 00:47:33,173
where one reacts
exactly right or completely wrong.

941
00:47:33,797 --> 00:47:35,708
I forgot the whistle.

942
00:47:36,032 --> 00:47:37,807
But that's not what I'm talking about.

943
00:47:38,702 --> 00:47:42,013
This is a difficult time for you.
For both of us.

944
00:47:42,072 --> 00:47:44,518
And especially for a woman,

945
00:47:44,574 --> 00:47:46,645
there are physical changes
that affect everything.

946
00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:48,815
Tell me about being a woman.

947
00:47:49,479 --> 00:47:52,551
I think that the anger you're feeling
is not actually about me. It's hormonal.

948
00:47:52,849 --> 00:47:55,227
No, it's not menopause.

949
00:47:55,318 --> 00:47:57,320
It actually is about you.

950
00:48:12,836 --> 00:48:14,838
Zee men in my family have a gift.

951
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:21,686
They find things
that no one else can find, Gadje.

952
00:48:24,914 --> 00:48:25,915
Gadje.

953
00:50:03,279 --> 00:50:04,815
- Hello?
- Dad'

954
00:50:04,881 --> 00:50:08,192
Grace. Gracie, you surprised me.

955
00:50:08,284 --> 00:50:11,322
<i>- What do you mean?
- Well, it's 5:00 in the morning here.</i>

956
00:50:11,387 --> 00:50:12,866
- It is?
- Yeah.

957
00:50:12,956 --> 00:50:16,563
<i>Oh, God, you're right.
I counted wrong. Go back to sleep.</i>

958
00:50:16,659 --> 00:50:19,139
No, no, no, no. I was up.

959
00:50:19,195 --> 00:50:20,538
Tell me about Bora-Bora.

960
00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:21,734
<i>Amazing.</i>

961
00:50:21,998 --> 00:50:23,909
You've got to come here someday.

962
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,071
Dad, Sam and I can't stop talking
about the wedding.

963
00:50:26,169 --> 00:50:27,842
It was just what we hoped.

964
00:50:27,904 --> 00:50:29,906
And I know you didn't want Freeway
in the ceremony,

965
00:50:30,006 --> 00:50:32,384
but you have to admit, it was sweet.

966
00:50:32,475 --> 00:50:33,579
<i>How's Mom?</i>

967
00:50:33,676 --> 00:50:35,883
She's great. She's fine.

968
00:50:35,979 --> 00:50:39,552
<i>Really? Is she doing okay? No big letdown?</i>

969
00:50:39,649 --> 00:50:42,721
She's relieved
that Sam took you off our hands.

970
00:50:43,653 --> 00:50:45,257
When are you going back?

971
00:50:45,421 --> 00:50:46,593
<i>Later on.</i>

972
00:50:46,890 --> 00:50:49,427
<i>Okay, well, we're going to dinner,
but! want to talk to Mom.</i>

973
00:50:49,525 --> 00:50:50,731
Call her when you wake up.

974
00:50:50,827 --> 00:50:53,171
<i>- Okay, give her a hug for me.
- Sure.</i>

975
00:50:53,863 --> 00:50:57,276
And give Freeway some of that salmon
that fell on the floor' He's earned it.

976
00:50:57,433 --> 00:51:00,414
You got it, cookie. You just have fun.

977
00:51:00,503 --> 00:51:02,540
<i>Okay, love you.</i>

978
00:51:02,605 --> 00:51:04,414
I love you. Bye.

979
00:51:52,455 --> 00:51:53,627
Hello?

980
00:51:56,659 --> 00:51:58,070
I thought so.

981
00:52:01,631 --> 00:52:03,133
Thanks.

982
00:52:03,232 --> 00:52:04,734
This is good.

983
00:52:04,801 --> 00:52:06,280
I was picturing a waterfall.

984
00:52:06,336 --> 00:52:08,839
Now a hiker saw a dog
above Bear Creek Falls.

985
00:52:15,011 --> 00:52:16,422
There's a reason you stayed,

986
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:18,991
but it's not the one you think.

987
00:52:19,082 --> 00:52:21,619
No, I stayed to help find the dog.

988
00:52:22,251 --> 00:52:23,491
Good.

989
00:52:23,586 --> 00:52:26,123
Russell will need your help
finding the redheaded woman.

990
00:52:26,990 --> 00:52:28,936
I'm supposed to find the redheaded woman?

991
00:52:28,992 --> 00:52:31,370
Yes, it will take both of you to do it.

992
00:52:31,461 --> 00:52:34,634
Okay. Where are we supposed to look?

993
00:52:34,696 --> 00:52:37,370
I'm seeing a green house.

994
00:52:37,866 --> 00:52:40,312
No, yellow. It's unclear.

995
00:52:41,770 --> 00:52:44,216
- On a street named for a tree.
- Okay.

996
00:52:44,506 --> 00:52:46,611
A tree.
Well, yeah, I'm gonna head up to Bear Creek.

997
00:52:46,775 --> 00:52:47,845
Yeah, I'm gonna go with you.

998
00:52:47,943 --> 00:52:49,115
Well, not with that knee.

999
00:52:49,211 --> 00:52:51,316
No, you, please, come with me.
I need your help,

1000
00:52:52,647 --> 00:52:53,682
Well, I could go with Beth.

1001
00:52:56,284 --> 00:52:57,627
Or I could stick with Russell.

1002
00:52:58,286 --> 00:52:59,287
I don't mind going alone.

1003
00:52:59,454 --> 00:53:00,626
No.

1004
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:13,140
Hey, Joseph.

1005
00:53:22,177 --> 00:53:23,815
Freeway!

1006
00:53:32,821 --> 00:53:34,926
I don't understand
why you're not talking to me.

1007
00:53:35,590 --> 00:53:38,764
I came back
because I wanted to be here for you.

1008
00:53:41,663 --> 00:53:43,040
I understand searching for Freeway.

1009
00:53:43,098 --> 00:53:45,339
But this Carmen crap?

1010
00:53:45,834 --> 00:53:47,336
It's voodoo.

1011
00:53:48,603 --> 00:53:51,243
But if another day of searching
is gonna make you feel better,

1012
00:53:51,339 --> 00:53:52,841
I'm here to support you.

1013
00:53:52,908 --> 00:53:56,287
Could we just not talk for a while?

1014
00:53:56,378 --> 00:53:57,379
I don't need to talk.

1015
00:54:02,084 --> 00:54:03,927
I think it's good for two people

1016
00:54:04,019 --> 00:54:06,898
to have quiet time together,

1017
00:54:06,955 --> 00:54:11,131
to heal, to smooth out the feathers
or whatever.

1018
00:54:20,035 --> 00:54:21,378
Grace called.

1019
00:54:21,436 --> 00:54:22,608
- What?
- Yeah.

1020
00:54:22,704 --> 00:54:24,377
- When?
- This morning. You were sleeping.

1021
00:54:25,207 --> 00:54:26,914
You didn't tell her about Freeway, did you?

1022
00:54:27,042 --> 00:54:28,077
Of course not.

1023
00:54:28,243 --> 00:54:30,985
- What did she say?
- They're having a great time.

1024
00:54:31,079 --> 00:54:32,558
They loved the wedding.

1025
00:54:33,949 --> 00:54:35,155
Anything else?

1026
00:54:35,417 --> 00:54:36,657
She asked how you're doing.

1027
00:54:37,285 --> 00:54:38,992
Excuse me. Sorry.

1028
00:54:39,654 --> 00:54:41,292
Oh, hey!

1029
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:43,470
You didn't happen
to see a dog up there, did you?

1030
00:54:43,558 --> 00:54:45,401
- Yeah.
- You did?

1031
00:54:47,562 --> 00:54:49,098
Like that?

1032
00:54:49,731 --> 00:54:51,267
Yeah, could be.

1033
00:54:52,634 --> 00:54:54,807
Where exactly does this trail go?

1034
00:54:54,903 --> 00:54:57,577
It heads up towards Purgatory,
then loops back.

1035
00:54:57,639 --> 00:54:59,448
- Come on.
- It loops back? How is it?

1036
00:54:59,641 --> 00:55:00,813
It's radical.

1037
00:55:10,819 --> 00:55:12,298
Do you think you'll ever get married?

1038
00:55:12,354 --> 00:55:14,857
Perhaps.

1039
00:55:14,956 --> 00:55:16,993
I'm sure you have no trouble attracting men.

1040
00:55:17,092 --> 00:55:19,971
They swarm like flies,
but who wants a fly?

1041
00:55:22,531 --> 00:55:25,137
I'm a passionate woman.
It's not easy to find a man

1042
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,180
who can keep up with me sexually.

1043
00:55:27,269 --> 00:55:29,340
- Yeah, it's tough for women like us.
- Yeah.

1044
00:55:29,437 --> 00:55:32,543
There was one, But he was a pickpocket.

1045
00:55:32,641 --> 00:55:35,019
My family would not tolerate that.

1046
00:55:35,110 --> 00:55:37,886
- No, of course not.
- It's not steady work.

1047
00:55:39,881 --> 00:55:42,191
Russell is very cheerful.

1048
00:55:42,284 --> 00:55:43,786
Can he keep up with you?

1049
00:55:44,719 --> 00:55:47,063
Why do you think he's so cheerful?

1050
00:56:10,212 --> 00:56:11,247
Do you want me to get that?

1051
00:56:12,314 --> 00:56:13,588
I got it.

1052
00:56:14,983 --> 00:56:16,189
Okay.

1053
00:56:16,651 --> 00:56:19,495
<i>- Yeah?
- What are you doing?</i>

1054
00:56:19,554 --> 00:56:21,693
Right now?

1055
00:56:21,823 --> 00:56:23,393
We're way the hell up toward Purgatory.

1056
00:56:24,092 --> 00:56:25,571
Where's that?

1057
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:27,662
<i>Above Bear Creek.</i>

1058
00:56:28,396 --> 00:56:31,104
Yeah, we met a guy who saw a dog.

1059
00:56:31,833 --> 00:56:34,109
Okay, you sound
like you're having a heart attack.

1060
00:56:34,202 --> 00:56:35,408
- Let me talk to Beth.
- Hold on.

1061
00:56:36,037 --> 00:56:37,380
- Beth.
- What?

1062
00:56:37,439 --> 00:56:39,282
- Penny, for you.
- Okay.

1063
00:56:40,675 --> 00:56:43,053
- Hi, Penny.
- He sounds terrible.

1064
00:56:44,012 --> 00:56:46,583
No matter what you're feeling,
don't kill him.

1065
00:56:46,681 --> 00:56:47,682
<i>Where are you, anyway?</i>

1066
00:56:48,083 --> 00:56:50,120
I'm underneath the gondola.

1067
00:56:50,218 --> 00:56:53,597
Carmen had a vision
about porta-potties and took off.

1068
00:56:53,688 --> 00:56:55,190
I think she's coming back.

1069
00:56:55,257 --> 00:56:56,861
<i>Don't worry,
I'll check in with you in an hour.</i>

1070
00:57:00,762 --> 00:57:02,264
Don't drink that so fast.

1071
00:57:02,564 --> 00:57:03,736
That's drinking too much.

1072
00:57:04,199 --> 00:57:05,769
God, really.

1073
00:57:07,736 --> 00:57:08,874
Careful.

1074
00:57:09,204 --> 00:57:10,547
I love this.

1075
00:57:10,605 --> 00:57:13,779
We're on the job, like those cop partners.

1076
00:57:13,875 --> 00:57:15,650
I'm the grizzled old guy,
and you're the young kid

1077
00:57:15,744 --> 00:57:17,382
who thinks he knows everything.

1078
00:57:17,445 --> 00:57:20,449
You mean the one the older one resents
cause the younger one's actually smarter?

1079
00:57:20,548 --> 00:57:23,051
Yeah, until you save my life.

1080
00:57:23,118 --> 00:57:24,426
You know, Carmen said there was...

1081
00:57:24,486 --> 00:57:26,295
The house was either yellow or green.

1082
00:57:26,388 --> 00:57:27,731
I don't know. Maybe she's confused.

1083
00:57:27,789 --> 00:57:30,235
Yeah, maybe she's really a Gypsy.

1084
00:57:31,293 --> 00:57:32,795
You think she's faking?

1085
00:57:32,894 --> 00:57:35,898
Beautiful women get away with a lot of shit.

1086
00:57:37,899 --> 00:57:39,242
Hello?

1087
00:57:39,934 --> 00:57:41,072
Carmen?

1088
00:57:41,670 --> 00:57:43,513
I am not sure about the color of the house.

1089
00:57:43,605 --> 00:57:45,141
I'm getting mixed messages.

1090
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:46,617
Something about blue.

1091
00:57:47,175 --> 00:57:48,245
Blue, okay.

1092
00:57:48,476 --> 00:57:50,319
Don't lose faith.

1093
00:57:50,412 --> 00:57:51,686
Hello? Carmen?

1094
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:54,317
- What?
- She's getting mixed messages,

1095
00:57:54,416 --> 00:57:55,793
something about blue.

1096
00:57:55,850 --> 00:58:01,266
Okay.

1097
00:58:02,023 --> 00:58:04,936
God, maybe we should have just taken...
I don't know, the other trail.

1098
00:58:05,026 --> 00:58:06,528
- The one that went up? No, no, no.
- No, because...

1099
00:58:06,628 --> 00:58:08,005
If we'd done that,
we'd be sleeping out here tonight.

1100
00:58:08,096 --> 00:58:09,336
No, we've got to get down.

1101
00:58:09,431 --> 00:58:10,603
But we don't know where we are,

1102
00:58:10,665 --> 00:58:12,702
so maybe we should backtrack or...
I don't know.

1103
00:58:12,801 --> 00:58:14,109
No, no, no, no, no.

1104
00:58:14,169 --> 00:58:16,274
Dear, we've been out here
for about five hours.

1105
00:58:16,638 --> 00:58:17,844
- Yeah.
- It'll take at least that long

1106
00:58:17,939 --> 00:58:19,441
to get back by backtracking.

1107
00:58:19,507 --> 00:58:21,282
- How do you know?
- It's almost 4:00 now. it's gonna be dark

1108
00:58:21,343 --> 00:58:22,879
- in a couple of hours...
- I know it's gonna be dark,

1109
00:58:22,977 --> 00:58:25,514
but how do you know this is going down
and not just deeper into the woods?

1110
00:58:25,613 --> 00:58:27,684
- We're following the creek.
- I think we should call someone.

1111
00:58:27,782 --> 00:58:29,227
Creeks always run downhill.

1112
00:58:29,317 --> 00:58:30,853
I think we should call someone.

1113
00:58:30,952 --> 00:58:32,397
What? And say what?

1114
00:58:32,487 --> 00:58:34,296
- And say that we're lost.
- We're not lost.

1115
00:58:34,356 --> 00:58:35,528
- Oh, God.
- Honey, look, look.

1116
00:58:35,623 --> 00:58:37,034
- See over there?
- What? Yeah.

1117
00:58:37,125 --> 00:58:38,468
There. That's Mount Wilson.

1118
00:58:38,526 --> 00:58:41,302
Yeah, which means what?
You can see Mount Wilson from Utah.

1119
00:58:41,363 --> 00:58:43,001
Oh, shit.

1120
00:58:43,498 --> 00:58:45,341
My battery is way down.

1121
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:46,902
Please, come on, come on.

1122
00:58:47,135 --> 00:58:49,547
- What are you gonna say?
- Well, I'm just gonna tell them

1123
00:58:49,637 --> 00:58:51,173
that if they haven't
heard from us in an hour,

1124
00:58:51,239 --> 00:58:52,479
they should call Search and Rescue.

1125
00:58:52,841 --> 00:58:54,912
That's embarrassing. You're panicking.

1126
00:58:55,310 --> 00:58:56,755
- Penny!
- Hi.

1127
00:58:56,978 --> 00:58:59,254
<i>Penny, oh, God. Thank God.
No, I'm so happy.</i>

1128
00:58:59,347 --> 00:59:01,520
<i>Listen, I just didn't think
this phone was gonna work.</i>

1129
00:59:01,883 --> 00:59:04,489
<i>- Where are you guys?
- I don't know. I think we're lost.</i>

1130
00:59:04,552 --> 00:59:06,862
<i>Listen, if you don't hear
from us in an hour...</i>

1131
00:59:07,889 --> 00:59:08,993
Penny?

1132
00:59:09,057 --> 00:59:10,400
Penny? Oh, shoot!

1133
00:59:10,525 --> 00:59:11,833
Beth?

1134
00:59:12,093 --> 00:59:13,367
Beth?

1135
00:59:14,329 --> 00:59:15,399
Lost...

1136
00:59:15,864 --> 00:59:18,071
The phone is dead, honey.
Can you please turn yours on, quick?

1137
00:59:18,933 --> 00:59:20,207
Shoot.

1138
00:59:22,069 --> 00:59:24,379
Damn. It's already on.
I forgot to turn it off.

1139
00:59:27,107 --> 00:59:29,348
- Yeah?
- Joseph, what happened?

1140
00:59:29,510 --> 00:59:31,080
<i>Penny, listen, listen,
I've got to talk fast.</i>

1141
00:59:31,345 --> 00:59:34,451
There's no reason to panic,
but we got Mount Wilson on our left,

1142
00:59:34,548 --> 00:59:36,789
and we started out from Bear Creek,
so that means that right now,

1143
00:59:36,884 --> 00:59:39,626
we are somewhere between those two...
Penny?

1144
00:59:40,354 --> 00:59:41,765
Joseph?

1145
00:59:42,089 --> 00:59:43,193
Joseph!

1146
00:59:43,757 --> 00:59:47,136
Shit, shit,

1147
00:59:47,227 --> 00:59:48,467
shit!

1148
00:59:48,562 --> 00:59:50,235
You're panicking.

1149
00:59:51,765 --> 00:59:55,076
What made her call right then,
right when we were talking about her?

1150
00:59:55,135 --> 00:59:57,137
Gypsy shit.

1151
00:59:57,237 --> 00:59:58,807
It's weird.

1152
01:00:06,713 --> 01:00:08,283
Hi. How are you?

1153
01:00:08,382 --> 01:00:10,157
Did Hector send you guys?

1154
01:00:10,651 --> 01:00:12,631
No, no, we lost our dog.

1155
01:00:12,719 --> 01:00:15,131
And we heard you might
have seen him, you know?

1156
01:00:15,622 --> 01:00:17,568
Blue, behave. Blue.

1157
01:00:18,926 --> 01:00:22,100
I seen this poster,
but I don't recall seeing Freeway his self.

1158
01:00:22,162 --> 01:00:24,301
Let me think. You know what?

1159
01:00:24,398 --> 01:00:26,435
Ever heard of Christus Bonheur?

1160
01:00:26,834 --> 01:00:28,074
No, ma'am.

1161
01:00:28,302 --> 01:00:30,748
Your dad's a charmer. Watch and learn.

1162
01:00:30,904 --> 01:00:31,974
Yes, ma'am.

1163
01:00:32,773 --> 01:00:35,083
I could tell you two was father and son
right away.

1164
01:00:35,142 --> 01:00:36,587
You're so much alike.

1165
01:00:36,643 --> 01:00:39,146
- Christus...
- Christus Bonheur,

1166
01:00:39,246 --> 01:00:41,783
a stone-cold psycho, if you want to know.

1167
01:00:41,849 --> 01:00:45,160
That degenerate's always got a bunch
of loose dogs hanging around.

1168
01:00:45,252 --> 01:00:48,028
Seen him in town the other day,
which is unusual.

1169
01:00:48,121 --> 01:00:49,600
Now, where could we find him, ma'am?

1170
01:00:49,656 --> 01:00:53,001
He's got a filthy shack halfway to nowhere.

1171
01:00:53,093 --> 01:00:56,666
You know where you turn off
North Fork to Rattlesnake Trail?

1172
01:00:56,763 --> 01:00:58,436
Up behind 17 Heifers?

1173
01:00:58,499 --> 01:01:00,536
17 Heifers? Yeah, I know where that is.

1174
01:01:00,634 --> 01:01:02,705
Much obliged, ma'am.

1175
01:01:02,803 --> 01:01:04,009
Blue.

1176
01:01:04,104 --> 01:01:05,344
All right, thank you, ma'am.

1177
01:01:05,439 --> 01:01:06,975
Hey, if you hit Squirrel Head,
you gone too far.

1178
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:08,178
Okay.

1179
01:01:10,177 --> 01:01:12,384
All right.
You know how to lay on the charm, Russell.

1180
01:01:12,479 --> 01:01:14,823
I just all of a sudden had a
Southern accent.

1181
01:01:27,661 --> 01:01:29,402
Did you ever hear of floaters?

1182
01:01:29,496 --> 01:01:30,702
Yeah, in your eye?

1183
01:01:30,797 --> 01:01:32,333
I never heard of them till last week.

1184
01:01:32,399 --> 01:01:34,140
Now I got 'em for the rest of my life.

1185
01:01:34,201 --> 01:01:36,704
It's no big deal. Older people get them.

1186
01:01:36,803 --> 01:01:38,407
It's fine. Your brain will adjust.

1187
01:01:38,505 --> 01:01:41,349
You won't even notice them.

1188
01:01:41,408 --> 01:01:43,718
You know, I'm not sure
this is such a good idea.

1189
01:01:43,810 --> 01:01:45,483
You think maybe we should
get a deputy or something?

1190
01:01:45,546 --> 01:01:50,495
No, we're just gonna go up there
and talk to old Christus, man-to-man.

1191
01:01:50,551 --> 01:01:52,553
You mean, stone-cold-psycho-to-man?

1192
01:01:52,653 --> 01:01:54,564
Well, my experience...

1193
01:01:54,655 --> 01:01:56,498
And I've been around quite a bit, Bryan...

1194
01:01:56,557 --> 01:01:58,730
Is that most people don't want trouble.

1195
01:01:58,825 --> 01:02:01,829
In fact, old Christus will probably be happy
to have some company.

1196
01:02:01,995 --> 01:02:02,996
Maybe.

1197
01:02:04,197 --> 01:02:06,541
My father left us for one of his students,

1198
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:08,876
never lifted a finger for Penny or me.

1199
01:02:08,936 --> 01:02:11,246
And the guy is an ethics professor.

1200
01:02:11,338 --> 01:02:14,012
Hadn't been for Joseph,
I couldn't have gone to medical school.

1201
01:02:14,074 --> 01:02:16,452
I bet you wish
your mom was dating a millionaire, huh?

1202
01:02:16,543 --> 01:02:19,285
Not a millionaire, Russell, okay?
Just someone who's making a living.

1203
01:02:19,379 --> 01:02:21,518
I mean, Mom worked hard
for that buyout money.

1204
01:02:21,582 --> 01:02:23,459
She shouldn't have to support you with it.

1205
01:02:23,550 --> 01:02:26,724
What happens if the Pigeon and the Truck
doesn't make any money, huh?

1206
01:02:26,787 --> 01:02:28,460
Do you actually know anyone
who likes warm beer?

1207
01:02:28,855 --> 01:02:30,266
It'll all work out. I'll Always.

1208
01:02:30,357 --> 01:02:31,427
No, it doesn't!

1209
01:02:31,525 --> 01:02:34,062
I love your mother,
and I'm gonna take care of her.

1210
01:02:34,127 --> 01:02:37,540
And I've been working since I was 15
so I can always find a job.

1211
01:02:37,598 --> 01:02:39,407
And the pub is gonna do just great,

1212
01:02:39,466 --> 01:02:40,968
but you shouldn't feel
any pressure to buy in.

1213
01:02:41,401 --> 01:02:42,436
Well, I don't.

1214
01:02:42,536 --> 01:02:45,278
Yeah, well, I think everybody who invests
is gonna make a lot of money.

1215
01:02:45,372 --> 01:02:48,376
Why? Why? 'Cause anything's possible?

1216
01:02:48,809 --> 01:02:51,380
That's my motto. Anything's possible.

1217
01:02:53,213 --> 01:02:54,556
Snake!

1218
01:02:56,883 --> 01:02:59,295
He's leaving. Don't piss him off.

1219
01:03:07,961 --> 01:03:09,736
You got to relax.

1220
01:03:22,909 --> 01:03:25,753
We've got no flashlight.
We've got no clothes. We've got nothing.

1221
01:03:25,812 --> 01:03:27,416
It was hot and sunny when we left.

1222
01:03:28,081 --> 01:03:29,958
You said we were only gonna be gone
a couple of hours...

1223
01:03:30,017 --> 01:03:33,089
Right, it's my fault.
Look, we both screwed up, okay?

1224
01:03:33,153 --> 01:03:35,656
Why can't you ever admit
you've made a mistake?

1225
01:03:35,756 --> 01:03:39,363
No, I guess it's genetically impossible,
given your father.

1226
01:03:39,459 --> 01:03:42,338
- I'm not like him.
- Well, then name one mistake you've made.

1227
01:03:42,429 --> 01:03:44,170
Besides coming out here with you?

1228
01:03:44,264 --> 01:03:46,301
I don't think in terms of mistakes.

1229
01:03:46,366 --> 01:03:49,609
I take responsibility for everything.
That's what doctors do.

1230
01:03:49,770 --> 01:03:51,374
That's right. I forgot. You're a doctor.

1231
01:03:51,471 --> 01:03:53,178
You hadn't mentioned
it in the last eight minutes.

1232
01:03:53,273 --> 01:03:55,514
Here we go. "Doctors think they're gods

1233
01:03:55,609 --> 01:03:58,021
"Doctors are self-absorbed egomaniacs. "

1234
01:03:58,111 --> 01:04:00,352
- And full of shit.
- Doctors are full of shit?

1235
01:04:00,447 --> 01:04:04,156
No, I am not talking about doctors.
I am talking about you.

1236
01:04:06,553 --> 01:04:09,659
Have I ever put my work
before you or the girls?

1237
01:04:13,293 --> 01:04:16,206
Okay, sometimes.

1238
01:04:16,296 --> 01:04:21,245
When I'm doing surgery on someone's spine
to relieve them of a life of pain,

1239
01:04:21,334 --> 01:04:24,213
I have put my work first.

1240
01:04:24,304 --> 01:04:26,648
The girls always understood,
and they never complained.

1241
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:28,815
Were we living in the same house?

1242
01:04:34,981 --> 01:04:36,983
- You see Freeway?
- No.

1243
01:04:39,486 --> 01:04:40,931
Wait, wait. The dogs are coming.

1244
01:04:41,054 --> 01:04:42,590
They're right there.

1245
01:04:42,923 --> 01:04:44,493
Stand slowly.

1246
01:04:46,093 --> 01:04:47,231
Don't move too fast.

1247
01:04:47,828 --> 01:04:49,239
- Hey, buddies!
- Hi, buddies.

1248
01:04:49,329 --> 01:04:51,240
- Hey-
- Hi, guys.

1249
01:04:51,331 --> 01:04:53,777
- Beautiful. What a sweetheart.
- Yep.

1250
01:05:11,184 --> 01:05:12,458
Shut Up!

1251
01:05:13,854 --> 01:05:16,300
Mr. Bonheur, I'm Bryan. This is Russell.

1252
01:05:16,389 --> 01:05:18,926
Yeah, we don't mean to bother you,
but we're looking for a dog.

1253
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:20,429
These is my dogs.

1254
01:05:20,527 --> 01:05:22,302
And a handsome bunch they are, too.

1255
01:05:22,395 --> 01:05:25,774
Yeah, we thought maybe our dog
had wandered up here and fallen in love.

1256
01:05:25,866 --> 01:05:28,813
- He didn't.
- Okay, well, we knew we'd be intruding,

1257
01:05:28,902 --> 01:05:32,076
so we got you a little something

1258
01:05:32,139 --> 01:05:34,779
in the hopes that you might show us around.

1259
01:05:34,875 --> 01:05:36,115
Now, we didn't know what you drink,

1260
01:05:36,209 --> 01:05:39,713
but most men enjoy
a good scotch whiskey, so...

1261
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:40,952
Get off my land.

1262
01:05:42,048 --> 01:05:43,618
It's not a single malt,

1263
01:05:43,717 --> 01:05:47,290
because people who drink that
don't do it for the taste.

1264
01:05:47,387 --> 01:05:49,765
They do it to make a statement
about who they are.

1265
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:51,894
But for you, sir, that is not an issue.

1266
01:06:00,467 --> 01:06:01,912
Shut Up!

1267
01:06:15,481 --> 01:06:17,757
Now get the hell out of here.

1268
01:06:22,421 --> 01:06:23,764
Hold it, ass-wipe.

1269
01:06:23,823 --> 01:06:25,268
Don't make me get out my shotgun.

1270
01:06:27,026 --> 01:06:29,370
Don't make me get out my Glock.

1271
01:06:34,033 --> 01:06:35,273
Freeway!

1272
01:06:37,336 --> 01:06:39,282
- Get off me!
- Jeez, you stink!

1273
01:06:39,471 --> 01:06:40,950
Freeway!

1274
01:06:43,375 --> 01:06:44,786
Shit.

1275
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:52,190
There are two things
that I won't allow in my pub,

1276
01:06:52,284 --> 01:06:54,321
and that's a troublemaker
and a man who stinks.

1277
01:06:58,557 --> 01:07:00,696
So if you're ever in Omaha,

1278
01:07:00,793 --> 01:07:02,966
you stay away
from the Partridge and the Plough!

1279
01:07:08,868 --> 01:07:11,041
I don't think
I can be this close to you much longer.

1280
01:07:11,136 --> 01:07:12,547
Shut Up!

1281
01:07:17,076 --> 01:07:18,384
Russell!

1282
01:07:20,012 --> 01:07:21,150
Let's go! Come on!

1283
01:07:46,038 --> 01:07:47,540
Shit. Russell?

1284
01:07:49,675 --> 01:07:51,348
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1285
01:07:56,582 --> 01:07:57,686
Get me to a shower.

1286
01:07:59,218 --> 01:08:00,595
Come on.

1287
01:08:02,254 --> 01:08:04,734
Man, figures the son of a bitch
went to Harvard.

1288
01:08:04,790 --> 01:08:08,294
They always got to let you know
about it too, don't they?

1289
01:08:18,270 --> 01:08:19,305
Look at that.

1290
01:08:19,405 --> 01:08:20,782
- Look at that.
- Holy shit.

1291
01:08:20,873 --> 01:08:22,443
What are they?

1292
01:08:22,541 --> 01:08:24,714
Those are rams, and they can be nasty.

1293
01:08:24,777 --> 01:08:26,279
But aren't they goats? Goats are small.

1294
01:08:26,378 --> 01:08:28,119
- No, they're sheep.
- Do they bite?

1295
01:08:28,213 --> 01:08:29,624
- No, they ram.
- Oh, my God.

1296
01:08:29,715 --> 01:08:30,989
But they can be controlled.

1297
01:08:31,150 --> 01:08:32,720
Little dogs control them just by yapping.

1298
01:08:32,952 --> 01:08:34,260
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.

1299
01:08:34,386 --> 01:08:35,797
I'll scare them off. You go back and hide.

1300
01:08:36,055 --> 01:08:37,227
- Right now?
- Stay hidden, yes.

1301
01:08:37,289 --> 01:08:38,427
- Okay, but are you all right?
- I'll be fine.

1302
01:08:38,490 --> 01:08:39,560
Okay, all right.

1303
01:08:40,159 --> 01:08:42,105
Oh, God! Be careful!

1304
01:08:42,161 --> 01:08:43,435
I'll take care of it.

1305
01:08:47,599 --> 01:08:49,101
Go away!

1306
01:08:49,168 --> 01:08:50,909
Hey, go on with you! Go!

1307
01:08:51,503 --> 01:08:52,675
Go back!

1308
01:08:54,406 --> 01:08:55,942
Go back to your friends!

1309
01:08:56,342 --> 01:08:57,343
Flock!

1310
01:08:57,443 --> 01:08:58,854
Flock! Go back to your flock!

1311
01:08:59,278 --> 01:09:00,313
Go back!

1312
01:09:00,412 --> 01:09:01,447
Are they leaving?

1313
01:09:01,981 --> 01:09:03,085
Not yet.

1314
01:09:13,092 --> 01:09:14,366
Honey, did it work?

1315
01:09:15,794 --> 01:09:17,501
- Honey?
- Oh, shit!

1316
01:09:17,596 --> 01:09:19,007
No!

1317
01:09:19,098 --> 01:09:20,475
Oh, careful!

1318
01:09:29,675 --> 01:09:31,211
Thank God you're all right!

1319
01:09:31,310 --> 01:09:32,880
Of course we're okay.

1320
01:09:32,978 --> 01:09:34,218
Hi, sweetheart.

1321
01:09:35,114 --> 01:09:36,684
Oh, my God. What happened?

1322
01:09:36,782 --> 01:09:38,728
It's a long story. What's wrong?

1323
01:09:38,817 --> 01:09:40,524
Beth and Joseph are lost.

1324
01:09:40,619 --> 01:09:43,031
Search and Rescue is looking for them.

1325
01:09:43,122 --> 01:09:45,659
I'm sure Beth and Joseph are fine.

1326
01:09:45,724 --> 01:09:47,829
- Was I right about these two?
- Yes.

1327
01:09:47,893 --> 01:09:49,463
Beth and Joseph are cold and wet,

1328
01:09:49,528 --> 01:09:51,804
but they'll be back here shortly.

1329
01:09:51,864 --> 01:09:53,036
I made soup. Go in.

1330
01:09:53,132 --> 01:09:54,975
- Thank you.
- Get some.

1331
01:09:55,801 --> 01:09:58,145
I know. I'll tell you about it.

1332
01:10:07,046 --> 01:10:09,890
Hold on! Let's head back up!

1333
01:10:09,982 --> 01:10:12,360
We got to be well past the rams by now!

1334
01:10:13,185 --> 01:10:15,859
All right. Honey, watch your step.

1335
01:10:15,988 --> 01:10:17,695
It's slippery here!

1336
01:10:17,756 --> 01:10:19,326
Hold on!

1337
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:21,337
Will you slow down a little bit?

1338
01:10:21,827 --> 01:10:23,033
Oh, God.

1339
01:10:23,095 --> 01:10:25,006
- I don't want to lose you.
- No.

1340
01:10:31,837 --> 01:10:34,181
Let's head back up! Back to the trail!

1341
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:35,912
Okay. But, here, wait.

1342
01:10:36,008 --> 01:10:38,511
Just grab hold of this branch right here
before you step!

1343
01:10:38,577 --> 01:10:39,885
Right this way.

1344
01:10:39,945 --> 01:10:41,447
Right here!

1345
01:10:42,848 --> 01:10:45,124
Okay, okay, okay. Yeah, yeah.

1346
01:10:54,026 --> 01:10:56,370
Oh, God! No, Joseph, are you okay?

1347
01:10:57,629 --> 01:10:59,040
Where are you?

1348
01:11:00,532 --> 01:11:01,738
God!

1349
01:11:04,303 --> 01:11:05,748
Joseph, I'm coming!

1350
01:11:09,475 --> 01:11:11,045
Joe! I'm coming!

1351
01:11:11,910 --> 01:11:14,220
What is it? What's wrong?

1352
01:11:14,546 --> 01:11:15,786
Tell me!

1353
01:11:16,748 --> 01:11:18,056
I'm sorry!

1354
01:11:18,584 --> 01:11:20,461
My shoulder.

1355
01:11:20,652 --> 01:11:22,996
- You're gonna have to put it back.
- Put it back?

1356
01:11:23,088 --> 01:11:24,567
- It's dislocated.
- What?

1357
01:11:24,623 --> 01:11:27,331
You have to put the humerus
back into the glenoid socket.

1358
01:11:27,426 --> 01:11:29,099
No, no, no, really, I cannot do that.

1359
01:11:29,161 --> 01:11:30,902
Let's just get you to the hospital,
all right?

1360
01:11:30,963 --> 01:11:34,911
No, you have to do it now,
before the muscles tighten.

1361
01:11:34,967 --> 01:11:37,914
All right, just, what about your arm?

1362
01:11:37,970 --> 01:11:41,008
What if it ruins it?
What if you never operate again, Joe?

1363
01:11:41,106 --> 01:11:42,346
- Honey...
- You can do it.

1364
01:11:42,441 --> 01:11:44,978
You just have to do exactly what I say.

1365
01:11:45,077 --> 01:11:46,351
- All right?
- Yes'

1366
01:11:46,445 --> 01:11:48,356
First, get me sitting.

1367
01:11:49,448 --> 01:11:50,791
Okay.

1368
01:11:51,450 --> 01:11:53,088
All right, honey.

1369
01:11:57,322 --> 01:12:01,634
All right, now I need you to bend this arm

1370
01:12:01,693 --> 01:12:03,832
until it's in a right angle.

1371
01:12:03,929 --> 01:12:05,465
Are you sure about this?

1372
01:12:05,531 --> 01:12:09,536
Now, pay attention.
I'm going to help you, all right?

1373
01:12:09,635 --> 01:12:13,048
Now hold one hand there.

1374
01:12:13,505 --> 01:12:17,453
Lift into the right angle
with the other hand, all right?

1375
01:12:17,509 --> 01:12:19,352
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1376
01:12:19,444 --> 01:12:22,015
Beth, I want you to ignore me

1377
01:12:22,114 --> 01:12:25,186
no matter how much I scream, all right?

1378
01:12:25,284 --> 01:12:26,285
Ignore your screams?

1379
01:12:26,351 --> 01:12:28,957
Yes, yes. Just go ahead.

1380
01:12:29,021 --> 01:12:30,659
- Okay.
- All right.

1381
01:12:32,658 --> 01:12:35,298
- Stop, stop! You're killing me!
- Okay, okay! I'm sorry!

1382
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:37,567
- I told you to ignore me!
- I know!

1383
01:12:37,663 --> 01:12:40,473
So ignore when you say stop, right?

1384
01:12:40,532 --> 01:12:42,739
Yes, ignore me. Keep going.

1385
01:12:42,834 --> 01:12:45,644
- All right, I'm going!
- All right, that's it, That a girl!

1386
01:12:45,704 --> 01:12:47,411
Okay, okay, okay, okay,
all right, all right.

1387
01:12:47,506 --> 01:12:49,713
There. Now, now, yes, {got it.

1388
01:12:49,808 --> 01:12:52,755
All right, now I want you to push the arm

1389
01:12:52,844 --> 01:12:55,825
into my side, okay,
till it's flush with my body.

1390
01:12:55,914 --> 01:12:57,552
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

1391
01:12:57,649 --> 01:12:59,650
Shit, Shit, shit, shit!

1392
01:12:59,717 --> 01:13:02,323
- There?
- Yeah.

1393
01:13:02,386 --> 01:13:03,831
That's good. That's good.

1394
01:13:03,888 --> 01:13:06,892
- All right, Is it back in?
- No.

1395
01:13:06,991 --> 01:13:08,436
Now is the hard part.

1396
01:13:08,526 --> 01:13:10,767
That wasn't the hard part?

1397
01:13:10,861 --> 01:13:13,398
Honey, take my wrist here.

1398
01:13:13,497 --> 01:13:17,502
Rotate the arm
away from my body until I say stop.

1399
01:13:17,568 --> 01:13:19,070
Wail,

1400
01:13:19,170 --> 01:13:21,707
So ignore...
Don't ignore you what you say this time?

1401
01:13:21,772 --> 01:13:23,615
No, yes. Yes, don't... Don't ignore.

1402
01:13:23,708 --> 01:13:25,051
Yes, I understand. I understand.

1403
01:13:25,109 --> 01:13:26,918
- Okay, here we go.
- Go.

1404
01:13:28,846 --> 01:13:30,917
- Yes?
- Stop, all right.

1405
01:13:31,015 --> 01:13:32,892
- Okay, stop.
- All right.

1406
01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:37,023
Now you're going to put my arm

1407
01:13:37,088 --> 01:13:39,932
back in the socket, all right?

1408
01:13:40,024 --> 01:13:42,436
<i>So what do... I'm gonna do that.</i>

1409
01:13:42,526 --> 01:13:44,199
- Yeah. Good girl.
- Just tell me what it is, exactly.

1410
01:13:44,262 --> 01:13:45,866
- I want you to put all your weight...
- I'm gonna put...

1411
01:13:45,930 --> 01:13:47,204
Yeah, yeah.

1412
01:13:47,265 --> 01:13:48,608
- Put all your weight...
- I'm trying, yes.

1413
01:13:48,699 --> 01:13:52,272
...In the crook of my arm,
Push down. Lean in to me.

1414
01:13:52,370 --> 01:13:53,974
It's gonna take all you've got, all right?

1415
01:13:54,071 --> 01:13:55,277
- But you can do it.
- Yes, I can.

1416
01:13:55,373 --> 01:13:56,613
All right, until it pops back in.

1417
01:13:56,707 --> 01:13:57,742
Okay, Joe.

1418
01:13:57,808 --> 01:14:00,288
Now lean. Go ahead. Go.

1419
01:14:03,981 --> 01:14:05,619
Is that.

1420
01:14:05,716 --> 01:14:07,127
I got it, Joe?

1421
01:14:07,218 --> 01:14:10,597
That was it, wasn't it?
Okay, hon, I got it, right?

1422
01:14:11,489 --> 01:14:13,560
Joe, honey, Joe?

1423
01:14:13,624 --> 01:14:14,830
Oh, my God, Joe.

1424
01:14:16,093 --> 01:14:17,401
Joe?

1425
01:14:18,829 --> 01:14:20,331
That worked.

1426
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:25,273
- How are you doing?
- I'm fine.

1427
01:14:26,137 --> 01:14:27,639
- Really?
- Sure.

1428
01:14:28,306 --> 01:14:29,580
Are you cold?

1429
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:31,244
No, no, I'm fine.

1430
01:14:31,909 --> 01:14:33,513
Are you worried?

1431
01:14:34,445 --> 01:14:35,822
A little.

1432
01:14:37,081 --> 01:14:38,287
You?

1433
01:14:40,017 --> 01:14:42,122
As you know, I'm a doctor.

1434
01:14:49,794 --> 01:14:51,432
Is that a house?

1435
01:14:55,466 --> 01:14:57,844
It is. Yeah.

1436
01:14:58,169 --> 01:14:59,614
Okay, honey.

1437
01:15:00,271 --> 01:15:01,443
Hello?

1438
01:15:01,772 --> 01:15:03,342
- Hello!
- Hello!

1439
01:15:04,875 --> 01:15:06,218
It's nice in there.

1440
01:15:06,444 --> 01:15:07,821
It looks like a good place.

1441
01:15:07,878 --> 01:15:09,516
Please! Hello!

1442
01:15:09,613 --> 01:15:11,889
Hello! Help! Help!

1443
01:15:12,149 --> 01:15:13,992
Okay, okay. I got it.

1444
01:15:14,652 --> 01:15:15,722
Should I do that?

1445
01:15:15,820 --> 01:15:17,458
- Should I really do this?
- Yeah.

1446
01:15:17,655 --> 01:15:18,963
Okay.

1447
01:15:21,659 --> 01:15:24,196
Okay, honey, okay, this is a bigger rock.

1448
01:15:24,295 --> 01:15:25,467
I think this should do it.

1449
01:15:30,301 --> 01:15:31,473
Back off! Back away!

1450
01:15:31,802 --> 01:15:34,646
I'd tell you to watch out for flying glass,

1451
01:15:34,805 --> 01:15:36,648
if I thought there'd be any.

1452
01:15:37,975 --> 01:15:39,045
Never mind!

1453
01:15:39,977 --> 01:15:41,422
I can't believe it!

1454
01:15:41,512 --> 01:15:43,924
I can't believe that I'm not strong enough
to break a window.

1455
01:15:44,014 --> 01:15:45,391
No, no, you're strong enough.

1456
01:15:45,483 --> 01:15:47,224
I think this has to be tempered glass
that's why...

1457
01:15:47,318 --> 01:15:49,491
What is it?
Are all the windows here tempered?

1458
01:15:50,154 --> 01:15:53,067
So wait a second now. Wait.
Okay, should I do this?

1459
01:15:53,157 --> 01:15:55,034
Yeah, but be careful. Watch your hand.

1460
01:15:55,092 --> 01:15:56,537
Okay, here I go!

1461
01:15:57,862 --> 01:15:59,034
- Oh, God.
- Hello?

1462
01:15:59,096 --> 01:16:02,236
- Careful of your hand!
- Okay, okay, all right.

1463
01:16:02,333 --> 01:16:05,439
Oh, my God, honey. Are you all right?

1464
01:16:05,536 --> 01:16:07,015
All right, now...

1465
01:16:08,205 --> 01:16:09,912
Oh, my God. Hello?

1466
01:16:10,608 --> 01:16:11,780
Hello?

1467
01:16:11,876 --> 01:16:13,355
Oh, my God.

1468
01:16:15,946 --> 01:16:16,947
Hello?

1469
01:16:33,097 --> 01:16:34,474
Nothing, nothing, nothing.

1470
01:16:37,535 --> 01:16:39,037
Okay.

1471
01:16:40,237 --> 01:16:41,545
I like their wine.

1472
01:16:41,605 --> 01:16:44,643
Yeah, it's pretty good.
Let's keep the label.

1473
01:16:45,443 --> 01:16:46,717
Should we?

1474
01:16:54,885 --> 01:16:56,125
Okay?

1475
01:16:56,220 --> 01:16:57,392
Yeah?

1476
01:16:59,557 --> 01:17:00,729
Delicious.

1477
01:17:00,791 --> 01:17:02,634
- How come we never have these?
- We have.

1478
01:17:02,726 --> 01:17:04,262
Really? I have no recollection.

1479
01:17:04,328 --> 01:17:05,602
That's because you're in shock.

1480
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:06,801
Your shoulder, honey.

1481
01:17:07,231 --> 01:17:09,336
- I know we haven't...
- Oh, my God!

1482
01:17:10,801 --> 01:17:12,747
Lower that weapon, deputy dog.

1483
01:17:15,339 --> 01:17:17,114
I had a feeling it'd be you guys.

1484
01:17:17,174 --> 01:17:19,814
You know the whole damn county
has been out looking for you?

1485
01:17:20,311 --> 01:17:21,449
How did you find us?

1486
01:17:21,946 --> 01:17:23,687
Silent alarm.

1487
01:17:23,781 --> 01:17:25,158
Would you let me through?

1488
01:17:25,249 --> 01:17:26,592
Damn it. God.

1489
01:17:28,419 --> 01:17:30,262
We got 'em! We got.

1490
01:17:30,321 --> 01:17:32,323
No, they look great.
They're in their pajamas.

1491
01:17:32,923 --> 01:17:34,163
Are you guys Okay?

1492
01:17:34,258 --> 01:17:35,635
Yeah, they're okay. Yeah, okay.

1493
01:17:35,693 --> 01:17:37,969
No, I have to go. Yeah, I'll tell 'em!

1494
01:17:38,028 --> 01:17:39,302
You scared the shit out of us.

1495
01:17:42,099 --> 01:17:44,340
- Buddy...
- No, no, don't touch him. No.

1496
01:17:44,435 --> 01:17:45,880
You know, he fell down.

1497
01:17:45,970 --> 01:17:47,347
Poor guy

1498
01:17:47,438 --> 01:17:48,781
He hurt his shoulder.

1499
01:17:49,173 --> 01:17:50,675
Well...

1500
01:19:08,519 --> 01:19:10,021
Okay, here we go.

1501
01:19:12,723 --> 01:19:14,031
Look at that.

1502
01:19:14,124 --> 01:19:15,797
French toast.

1503
01:19:18,295 --> 01:19:19,603
Clear!

1504
01:19:20,864 --> 01:19:22,400
Nourishment. That's what we need.

1505
01:19:22,466 --> 01:19:23,945
And a side of Lipitor, please.

1506
01:19:24,034 --> 01:19:25,274
Come on. Eat, Beth, eat.

1507
01:19:25,369 --> 01:19:26,609
- I can't...
- Last day.

1508
01:19:27,371 --> 01:19:29,476
Last day, right, your last day.

1509
01:19:29,873 --> 01:19:31,648
Sweetie, we've got to get back.

1510
01:19:32,376 --> 01:19:34,253
You guys have been
more than generous already.

1511
01:19:34,545 --> 01:19:36,320
We all have to get back to our lives.

1512
01:19:36,413 --> 01:19:37,824
I think we're gonna find Freeway today.

1513
01:19:38,215 --> 01:19:39,250
I don't know. Maybe.

1514
01:19:39,316 --> 01:19:40,920
Well, honey, you found him once.

1515
01:19:41,452 --> 01:19:43,830
Yeah, but that storm last night,
it was just so bad.

1516
01:19:44,254 --> 01:19:46,427
So what's the plan?
Carmen, what do you got for us?

1517
01:19:47,790 --> 01:19:49,292
Only one thing.

1518
01:19:50,393 --> 01:19:51,736
When I put the bacon in this pan,

1519
01:19:51,794 --> 01:19:54,673
I saw Freeway come out
of Lawson's Hill at Pioneer's Turn.

1520
01:19:54,764 --> 01:19:56,107
He wanted to cross the highway.

1521
01:19:56,165 --> 01:19:57,405
Cut the crap.

1522
01:19:57,467 --> 01:19:58,639
Beth.

1523
01:19:58,735 --> 01:20:01,511
Your visions sent us
all over hell yesterday.

1524
01:20:01,738 --> 01:20:02,910
Joseph got hurl.

1525
01:20:02,972 --> 01:20:05,475
And what about Bryan and Russell
risking their lives

1526
01:20:05,575 --> 01:20:08,818
because of some ridiculous
redheaded woman who knew nothing.

1527
01:20:08,911 --> 01:20:10,413
Not one thing you've said has been right.

1528
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:11,515
Some were close.

1529
01:20:11,848 --> 01:20:13,327
I understand you don't believe me.

1530
01:20:13,416 --> 01:20:16,295
But you must believe
Freeway is out there somewhere.

1531
01:20:16,352 --> 01:20:17,490
Is this a Gypsy thing,

1532
01:20:17,587 --> 01:20:19,965
manipulating people
when they're at their most vulnerable?

1533
01:20:20,356 --> 01:20:22,700
- Come on, Beth. She's trying to help.
- Don't defend me'

1534
01:20:22,792 --> 01:20:24,271
You have to stay focused.

1535
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:26,135
The moment you lose hope

1536
01:20:26,195 --> 01:20:29,142
is the moment your chances
of getting him back disappear.

1537
01:20:30,099 --> 01:20:32,170
- You have to have hope.
- That's all we've got.

1538
01:20:32,268 --> 01:20:33,679
That's all you need.

1539
01:20:33,770 --> 01:20:37,843
Don't you think Freeway wants to find you
as much as you want to find him?

1540
01:20:38,107 --> 01:20:39,484
I hope he's better at it than we are.

1541
01:20:39,609 --> 01:20:43,147
We can't get discouraged, guys.
We got to stay positive.

1542
01:20:47,350 --> 01:20:48,454
Hi? Hello?

1543
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:50,631
Carol.

1544
01:20:50,687 --> 01:20:52,860
No, we haven't found him.

1545
01:20:55,024 --> 01:20:56,332
<i>Where?</i>

1546
01:20:56,392 --> 01:20:57,564
The gas station?

1547
01:20:59,495 --> 01:21:00,667
That's near Pioneer Turn.

1548
01:21:00,830 --> 01:21:04,243
Oh, my God, okay. So, 10 minutes ago?

1549
01:21:04,834 --> 01:21:07,314
You saw him in the frying pan?

1550
01:21:07,403 --> 01:21:09,542
You are one freaky caretaker.

1551
01:21:09,639 --> 01:21:13,678
Listen, I lost a pair of really nice
horn-rimmed reading glasses last February.

1552
01:21:13,743 --> 01:21:15,552
Maybe you could check the French toast?

1553
01:21:15,645 --> 01:21:17,215
Just get the whistles! Grab a whistle!

1554
01:21:17,313 --> 01:21:19,759
Thank you, Carol.
Thank you so much for calling, really.

1555
01:21:19,849 --> 01:21:21,328
Oh, my God.

1556
01:21:21,918 --> 01:21:24,728
Carmen, oh, look. 1 really... I'm sorry.

1557
01:21:39,902 --> 01:21:42,041
Let's go up to Pioneer Turn.

1558
01:21:45,341 --> 01:21:47,617
Sorry, bumpy.

1559
01:21:50,079 --> 01:21:52,559
Mom called last night
when everyone was lost in the storm.

1560
01:21:52,615 --> 01:21:54,219
I told her you were hiking.

1561
01:21:54,283 --> 01:21:56,058
I'll call her today.

1562
01:21:56,119 --> 01:21:58,429
Did she say anything about the wedding?

1563
01:21:58,521 --> 01:22:00,558
She thought it was lovely.

1564
01:22:01,624 --> 01:22:03,467
She said the food gave her gout.

1565
01:22:03,559 --> 01:22:04,765
That's your mother.

1566
01:22:04,861 --> 01:22:06,534
- Hey, she's your grandmother.
- Meaning what?

1567
01:22:06,796 --> 01:22:09,640
Meaning the dark side is
strong in all of us.

1568
01:22:09,732 --> 01:22:10,904
By the way, Joseph,

1569
01:22:10,967 --> 01:22:12,708
it's your turn to go to Phoenix.

1570
01:22:13,069 --> 01:22:14,571
Don't I get credit for the wedding?

1571
01:22:14,637 --> 01:22:18,483
No, because you put her at my table
with Sam's parents.

1572
01:22:18,574 --> 01:22:21,714
She asked Numendra
what he was in his last life.

1573
01:22:22,311 --> 01:22:23,915
All right, Mom.
I will go with you next time.

1574
01:22:23,980 --> 01:22:25,755
Nobody should have to go
through that alone.

1575
01:22:25,815 --> 01:22:27,158
Thank you.

1576
01:22:27,250 --> 01:22:28,957
Russell offered to go with me.

1577
01:22:29,051 --> 01:22:30,394
He's good with difficult people.

1578
01:22:30,953 --> 01:22:32,398
I've noticed.

1579
01:22:32,455 --> 01:22:33,900
The guy's pretty fearless.

1580
01:22:44,467 --> 01:22:45,946
No luck.

1581
01:22:46,602 --> 01:22:48,013
You want to come with me?

1582
01:22:49,005 --> 01:22:51,849
You take a knife
and you cut into people's backs.

1583
01:22:51,941 --> 01:22:53,249
How can you do that?

1584
01:22:53,309 --> 01:22:54,515
They're asleep.

1585
01:22:54,610 --> 01:22:56,419
That must take large cojones.

1586
01:22:57,079 --> 01:22:58,649
Well, they trained me to do it.

1587
01:22:58,748 --> 01:23:01,194
But, yes, I have large cojones.

1588
01:23:03,586 --> 01:23:05,623
How long did it take?

1589
01:23:05,688 --> 01:23:08,965
It's four years of medical school,
five-year residency,

1590
01:23:09,025 --> 01:23:11,767
- and a two-year fellowship.
- Eleven years?

1591
01:23:12,028 --> 01:23:13,837
Yeah, after college.

1592
01:23:14,330 --> 01:23:15,673
What?

1593
01:23:16,766 --> 01:23:19,178
When did they start calling you doctor?

1594
01:23:20,870 --> 01:23:23,510
About 10 years ago, after med school.

1595
01:23:24,607 --> 01:23:26,951
Maybe I should call you doctor.

1596
01:23:39,222 --> 01:23:41,862
I just hate
the thought of leaving Beth up here alone.

1597
01:23:42,191 --> 01:23:45,365
Hold her,
come home for a few days, recharge,

1598
01:23:45,461 --> 01:23:46,872
and we'll come back on the weekend.

1599
01:23:46,963 --> 01:23:49,034
She's afraid the search
will end if she leaves.

1600
01:23:49,131 --> 01:23:50,701
But everyone's on the lookout.

1601
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:52,370
If he's out there, somebody will spot him.

1602
01:23:52,468 --> 01:23:53,913
If he's out there.

1603
01:23:58,040 --> 01:24:00,714
Okay, I'll go home with you tomorrow.

1604
01:24:00,810 --> 01:24:01,914
I will.

1605
01:24:02,912 --> 01:24:04,220
Anyway.

1606
01:24:05,982 --> 01:24:07,222
Hi, sweetie.

1607
01:24:07,316 --> 01:24:09,694
We're just having coffee
before we head out again.

1608
01:24:09,752 --> 01:24:11,698
Okay, look, Carmen says, don't give up hope.

1609
01:24:11,754 --> 01:24:12,892
Wait, I'm gonna put you on the speaker.

1610
01:24:13,256 --> 01:24:14,394
Okay.

1611
01:24:15,191 --> 01:24:17,171
Okay. We're all here.

1612
01:24:17,693 --> 01:24:20,230
Carmen says Freeway
really wants to come in,

1613
01:24:20,329 --> 01:24:21,831
but he's got to hear a friendly voice.

1614
01:24:22,765 --> 01:24:25,245
<i>Okay, what... Don't laugh. Wait a second.</i>

1615
01:24:25,902 --> 01:24:27,745
- Okay.
- So...

1616
01:24:28,371 --> 01:24:30,851
Carmen has a strong feeling
about a basketball court.

1617
01:24:31,607 --> 01:24:33,018
Okay, okay.

1618
01:24:33,509 --> 01:24:36,217
Now, there are two basketball courts
in town. We're going to the high school.

1619
01:24:36,279 --> 01:24:37,883
Can you guys cover the one in Town Park?

1620
01:24:37,947 --> 01:24:40,951
- Town Park.
- Town Park, okay, okay.

1621
01:24:41,050 --> 01:24:42,859
- All right, we're going to Town Pam.
- Town Park.

1622
01:24:53,863 --> 01:24:57,367
He's been gone two days,
so if you see a dog like this...

1623
01:24:57,566 --> 01:25:00,604
Okay, well, no, your hands are full.

1624
01:25:00,703 --> 01:25:02,273
Okay, well, thanks anyway. I appreciate it.

1625
01:25:02,371 --> 01:25:03,782
- Thank you so much.
- Okay, bye-bye, guys.

1626
01:25:03,873 --> 01:25:05,910
- Have a good picnic now.
- Smells good.

1627
01:25:05,975 --> 01:25:07,477
Come on, darling.

1628
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:19,331
Freeway!

1629
01:25:19,922 --> 01:25:21,765
Freeway, come on in!

1630
01:25:27,830 --> 01:25:29,810
I can hardly remember the wedding.

1631
01:25:30,232 --> 01:25:32,337
- Everyone loved it.
- They did?

1632
01:25:32,835 --> 01:25:34,644
Especially my mother. It gave her gout.

1633
01:25:37,239 --> 01:25:40,584
I'll bet you remember
how beautiful Grace looked.

1634
01:25:40,643 --> 01:25:41,986
Yeah, and Ellie.

1635
01:25:42,078 --> 01:25:44,251
Ellie, too.

1636
01:25:44,313 --> 01:25:46,315
We're gonna have another doctor
in the family.

1637
01:25:46,415 --> 01:25:47,519
Wow.

1638
01:25:47,616 --> 01:25:50,187
Ethan could use a cousin.

1639
01:25:50,286 --> 01:25:51,594
They should get right on that.

1640
01:25:51,654 --> 01:25:53,327
Yeah, so to speak.

1641
01:25:53,422 --> 01:25:56,767
I told Grace to throw away her pills
two months ago.

1642
01:26:00,629 --> 01:26:03,007
I'm sorry I forgot the dog whistle.

1643
01:26:05,167 --> 01:26:07,306
That wasn't it.

1644
01:26:07,370 --> 01:26:09,179
No, I know.

1645
01:26:09,271 --> 01:26:11,444
I'm gonna try to be better.

1646
01:26:12,942 --> 01:26:14,819
<i>I can't promise you I'll be much different.</i>

1647
01:26:14,877 --> 01:26:17,289
It may be a little late for that.

1648
01:26:18,280 --> 01:26:20,556
I'm gonna try to calm down.

1649
01:26:21,851 --> 01:26:23,694
You can't help it.

1650
01:26:24,553 --> 01:26:26,055
It's a jolt finding ourselves like this.

1651
01:26:27,123 --> 01:26:28,227
Like what?

1652
01:26:29,158 --> 01:26:30,159
Not young.

1653
01:26:31,293 --> 01:26:32,363
Oh, my God.

1654
01:26:32,461 --> 01:26:36,374
Have you noticed the ages
of the people in the obits?

1655
01:26:36,464 --> 01:26:39,502
- It's not funny.
- No, it is funny.

1656
01:26:39,634 --> 01:26:43,047
I was thinking,
maybe we ought to invest in the pub.

1657
01:26:43,138 --> 01:26:45,379
Yeah, I was thinking that, too.

1658
01:26:45,473 --> 01:26:48,477
The Partridge and the Plough?

1659
01:26:48,543 --> 01:26:50,523
It's growing on me.

1660
01:26:50,578 --> 01:26:53,320
Doesn't mean I'm gonna drink warm beer.

1661
01:26:55,717 --> 01:26:57,424
- Here, Freeway!
- Hey, buddy!

1662
01:26:57,519 --> 01:26:59,556
Come on! Come on, Freeway!

1663
01:27:03,391 --> 01:27:06,031
- Careful, baby. Careful.
- No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

1664
01:27:06,094 --> 01:27:08,005
I'm fine. I'm fine.

1665
01:27:08,063 --> 01:27:10,907
I was so scared last night.

1666
01:27:10,999 --> 01:27:13,912
Everybody I care about
was out in that storm.

1667
01:27:14,002 --> 01:27:15,777
We all made it.

1668
01:27:18,573 --> 01:27:21,611
I'm never letting you out of my sight again.

1669
01:27:23,411 --> 01:27:25,049
Get used to it.

1670
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:27,450
Get used to it.

1671
01:27:31,419 --> 01:27:33,695
You would make a fine husband.

1672
01:27:33,855 --> 01:27:36,802
- For you?
- No. Not for me.

1673
01:27:36,891 --> 01:27:38,928
<i>Why not?</i>

1674
01:27:39,027 --> 01:27:40,301
It would never work.

1675
01:27:40,395 --> 01:27:42,068
I could see the whole thing.

1676
01:27:42,130 --> 01:27:43,200
Tell me.

1677
01:27:45,633 --> 01:27:49,103
The wedding would be very strange
but funny.

1678
01:27:50,138 --> 01:27:53,711
We would have to keep an eye
on my father around Penny,

1679
01:27:53,775 --> 01:27:55,914
My mother would disapprove of everything,

1680
01:27:55,977 --> 01:27:57,650
but Russell will melt her heart.

1681
01:27:57,745 --> 01:27:59,053
Yeah.

1682
01:28:00,582 --> 01:28:02,619
The sex will be fantastic.

1683
01:28:03,718 --> 01:28:06,790
You will have no problem
keeping up with me.

1684
01:28:07,989 --> 01:28:10,299
You've got good hands.

1685
01:28:10,391 --> 01:28:12,598
They will make me want to devour you.

1686
01:28:14,429 --> 01:28:16,272
Okay, this is all really good.

1687
01:28:16,331 --> 01:28:17,571
What's the problem?

1688
01:28:20,768 --> 01:28:23,908
You will take me to your world
of hospitals and cocktail parties.

1689
01:28:23,972 --> 01:28:26,145
You will introduce me
to all your educated friends,

1690
01:28:26,241 --> 01:28:27,845
and they will think,

1691
01:28:27,942 --> 01:28:30,582
"Bryan has let his dick make this decision,"

1692
01:28:35,450 --> 01:28:37,930
I will know what they're thinking

1693
01:28:38,353 --> 01:28:40,833
but that will not bother me.

1694
01:28:40,922 --> 01:28:44,529
What will bother me
is being in the wrong place.

1695
01:28:44,626 --> 01:28:47,334
You and I will become out of alignment.

1696
01:28:48,496 --> 01:28:50,100
Disaster will follow.

1697
01:28:55,270 --> 01:28:56,647
Tell me about the sex again.

1698
01:29:13,988 --> 01:29:15,296
What?

1699
01:29:18,893 --> 01:29:20,236
- Okay.
- Vision?

1700
01:29:23,831 --> 01:29:27,040
I was thinking,
in case one of us drops dead,

1701
01:29:27,135 --> 01:29:29,046
we shouldn't leave anything unsaid.

1702
01:29:29,137 --> 01:29:33,882
I don't want to be in cardiac arrest
thinking I forgot to tell you something.

1703
01:29:33,975 --> 01:29:36,148
Okay, go ahead.

1704
01:29:36,211 --> 01:29:37,417
Okay.

1705
01:29:39,914 --> 01:29:42,053
The girls were really lucky

1706
01:29:42,150 --> 01:29:44,596
when they got you for a mother.

1707
01:29:44,686 --> 01:29:49,931
While it's true that every so often,
you get on my nerves,

1708
01:29:50,024 --> 01:29:53,665
I just want to say
that the things that bug me about you

1709
01:29:53,728 --> 01:29:56,766
have never meant anything
compared with how much I love you.

1710
01:30:03,338 --> 01:30:04,749
Your turn.

1711
01:30:08,109 --> 01:30:09,179
Hey, GUYS.

1712
01:30:10,378 --> 01:30:12,016
We've reached a conclusion.

1713
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:13,388
This is nuts.

1714
01:30:13,448 --> 01:30:16,588
We've spent three days running around
on the word of a Gypsy psychic.

1715
01:30:16,718 --> 01:30:17,958
Alleged Gypsy psychic.

1716
01:30:18,052 --> 01:30:20,191
Well, it's all we had to go on,
so why not?

1717
01:30:20,555 --> 01:30:23,934
I know. I'm tired of it. I am.
I'm tired of it, too.

1718
01:30:28,196 --> 01:30:29,539
Hello?

1719
01:30:33,868 --> 01:30:35,279
Okay.

1720
01:30:37,105 --> 01:30:39,244
Carmen's had another vision.

1721
01:30:39,307 --> 01:30:41,617
9:30, Freeway,

1722
01:30:41,709 --> 01:30:44,383
between the ice cream parlor and the church.

1723
01:30:44,445 --> 01:30:46,118
- Can we do this?
- Let's go.

1724
01:30:46,214 --> 01:30:47,591
Thank you.

1725
01:30:47,649 --> 01:30:49,060
Okay, okay.

1726
01:30:54,822 --> 01:30:57,132
I really thought he'd be there.

1727
01:30:58,326 --> 01:31:00,738
What dog goes to church at 9:30?

1728
01:31:38,466 --> 01:31:40,707
He didn't say where he was going?

1729
01:31:40,802 --> 01:31:42,543
Sneaked out before I woke up.

1730
01:31:45,773 --> 01:31:47,980
And he just took your car?

1731
01:31:48,943 --> 01:31:50,445
Stole it.

1732
01:31:51,045 --> 01:31:52,786
Well, don't worry, He won't get far.

1733
01:31:53,548 --> 01:31:55,289
I got his plane ticket right here.

1734
01:32:01,456 --> 01:32:02,560
You all right?

1735
01:32:04,826 --> 01:32:06,305
No, I got it. I got it.

1736
01:32:06,361 --> 01:32:08,204
Here's Bryan now.

1737
01:32:08,296 --> 01:32:10,173
Hi, honey, You made it.

1738
01:32:12,467 --> 01:32:14,970
- Hey, Bryan.
- Thanks for everything.

1739
01:32:17,171 --> 01:32:19,310
- There he is.
- He's got a dog!

1740
01:32:19,374 --> 01:32:21,513
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, my God.

1741
01:32:21,576 --> 01:32:25,251
- I wasn't sure I'd make it.
- Oh, look.

1742
01:32:25,346 --> 01:32:26,484
You're one lucky dog.

1743
01:32:28,416 --> 01:32:30,327
- Carmen, thank you.
- Don't worry. Bye.

1744
01:32:30,385 --> 01:32:33,366
- I will keep looking.
- I'll see you on the plane.

1745
01:32:33,421 --> 01:32:35,025
Sorry about the car.

1746
01:32:35,089 --> 01:32:37,729
But I had to get to Norwood.

1747
01:32:37,825 --> 01:32:40,897
It was supposed to be his last day.

1748
01:32:40,995 --> 01:32:43,737
And you were right.
He was waiting for a man.

1749
01:32:43,831 --> 01:32:44,935
But I think he's your dog.

1750
01:32:48,870 --> 01:32:50,907
He doesn't have a name.

1751
01:32:51,005 --> 01:32:53,417
What do you think? Django junior?

1752
01:32:53,508 --> 01:32:55,681
I think I will call him DOC.

1753
01:33:15,930 --> 01:33:19,275
<i>It's gonna be a little bumpy
till we get over the mountains.</i>

1754
01:33:19,867 --> 01:33:22,279
I will never forgive you for this.

1755
01:33:22,370 --> 01:33:23,974
This isn't even a real airport.

1756
01:33:34,748 --> 01:33:36,728
There he is! Freeway!

1757
01:33:36,783 --> 01:33:39,059
He's down there! Oh, my God! I can see him!

1758
01:33:39,386 --> 01:33:41,957
- You see him? - Yes, he's down there.
We've got to go back.

1759
01:33:42,088 --> 01:33:43,761
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna tell them!

1760
01:33:43,824 --> 01:33:45,667
No, no, no.
They're not gonna tum the plane around

1761
01:33:45,759 --> 01:33:47,898
because you think you saw a dog.
They'll have you arrested!

1762
01:33:48,161 --> 01:33:51,005
Joseph, I saw him.

1763
01:33:51,565 --> 01:33:52,566
What? You saw Freeway?

1764
01:33:52,933 --> 01:33:54,503
You saw Freeway!

1765
01:34:01,141 --> 01:34:02,176
Oh. my God!

1766
01:34:04,911 --> 01:34:07,414
I knew it! We're crashing! We're crashing!

1767
01:34:08,248 --> 01:34:09,420
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, God.

1768
01:34:10,250 --> 01:34:11,490
Wait, are you okay?

1769
01:34:14,621 --> 01:34:16,328
- Don't overdo it.
- Good plan, right?

1770
01:34:16,423 --> 01:34:17,800
Okay. I got it.

1771
01:34:18,158 --> 01:34:20,001
On three. One, two...

1772
01:34:26,633 --> 01:34:28,044
Oh, God! Help us!

1773
01:34:28,134 --> 01:34:29,442
Oh, please, help him!

1774
01:34:31,605 --> 01:34:32,811
Hurry, please!

1775
01:34:32,873 --> 01:34:34,375
I got it! I got it!

1776
01:34:34,474 --> 01:34:36,112
Hold him. I got him.

1777
01:34:36,176 --> 01:34:37,382
It's a hijacking!

1778
01:34:37,611 --> 01:34:39,284
What the hell is going on back there?

1779
01:34:39,513 --> 01:34:41,823
Something happened to my friend!

1780
01:34:43,216 --> 01:34:44,559
Shut Up!

1781
01:34:45,685 --> 01:34:46,993
I don't know.

1782
01:34:47,053 --> 01:34:48,828
- It's the appendix.
- Or it could be a kidney stone!

1783
01:34:48,889 --> 01:34:50,664
Are we gonna die? Tell me the truth!

1784
01:34:50,724 --> 01:34:52,965
No, ma'am, I've got a passenger in distress.

1785
01:34:53,326 --> 01:34:54,999
We have to get this man
to a hospital immediately.

1786
01:34:55,061 --> 01:34:56,369
Turn this plane around right now.

1787
01:34:56,463 --> 01:34:58,067
- Are you a doctor?
- Yes!

1788
01:35:43,677 --> 01:35:45,452
Look down. Look down.

1789
01:35:45,545 --> 01:35:47,582
Watch your stairs. There we go.

1790
01:35:47,681 --> 01:35:49,217
Watch your stairs.

1791
01:35:49,282 --> 01:35:51,023
There you go. Nice, deep breaths.

1792
01:35:54,854 --> 01:35:56,856
Okay, guys, yeah. Thanks.

1793
01:36:03,897 --> 01:36:05,774
All right, here we go.

1794
01:36:20,046 --> 01:36:22,287
Arm around me. Arm around me.
Come on. Come on.

1795
01:36:22,382 --> 01:36:23,827
What's the problem here?

1796
01:36:24,050 --> 01:36:26,428
This one said
that one's appendix was bursting.

1797
01:36:26,486 --> 01:36:30,059
No, no, I said I thought it was his appendix,
but now I think more it's a kidney stone,

1798
01:36:30,490 --> 01:36:31,628
You a doctor?

1799
01:36:31,725 --> 01:36:32,931
Yeah, yeah. Well.

1800
01:36:33,293 --> 01:36:34,636
You in a lot of pain, Joe?

1801
01:36:34,728 --> 01:36:38,107
Well, no question it hurls.
Or rather, it was hurting.

1802
01:36:38,164 --> 01:36:40,110
I feel you, brother.
Let's get you to the clinic.

1803
01:36:40,166 --> 01:36:42,806
Okay, okay, yeah. Thank you.

1804
01:36:44,838 --> 01:36:46,647
Watch your head now.

1805
01:36:53,780 --> 01:36:56,090
Nice work. What do we do now?

1806
01:37:03,990 --> 01:37:06,527
Here! Right here is where I saw him!

1807
01:37:08,628 --> 01:37:09,971
Okay, stop!

1808
01:37:10,030 --> 01:37:11,771
No, no, Beth!

1809
01:37:12,365 --> 01:37:13,503
Come on!

1810
01:37:14,868 --> 01:37:16,370
Freeway!

1811
01:37:19,606 --> 01:37:21,176
Here, Freeway!

1812
01:37:21,274 --> 01:37:22,685
- Freeway...
- Freeway!

1813
01:37:22,776 --> 01:37:24,517
Come on, Freeway!

1814
01:37:33,353 --> 01:37:35,390
- Freeway?
- Here, Freeway!

1815
01:37:36,656 --> 01:37:38,135
There! Right there! There they are!

1816
01:37:38,191 --> 01:37:41,695
Here's good. Yeah, thanks a million,
Sheriff. We'll never forget this.

1817
01:37:41,795 --> 01:37:43,172
Hope it doesn't cause you any problems.

1818
01:37:43,296 --> 01:37:45,742
No one's ever gonna know about it.

1819
01:37:49,803 --> 01:37:51,578
Hey, Carmen, wait up!

1820
01:37:59,312 --> 01:38:02,486
Freeway!

1821
01:38:03,650 --> 01:38:05,357
- Carmen?
- Bryan?

1822
01:38:08,088 --> 01:38:09,533
Freeway?

1823
01:38:10,724 --> 01:38:12,397
Come on, Freeway.

1824
01:38:13,827 --> 01:38:14,897
Freeway!

1825
01:38:15,595 --> 01:38:16,869
You see him?

1826
01:38:16,930 --> 01:38:18,273
I don't know.

1827
01:38:27,173 --> 01:38:28,618
Freeway!

1828
01:38:43,056 --> 01:38:44,967
Freeway!

1829
01:38:57,904 --> 01:38:58,905
Freeway!

1830
01:39:04,377 --> 01:39:07,324
Freeway!

1831
01:39:10,316 --> 01:39:11,727
Freeway!

1832
01:39:16,556 --> 01:39:17,899
Freeway!

1833
01:39:19,392 --> 01:39:21,099
Hello, Look at you.

1834
01:39:29,402 --> 01:39:31,575
Freeway, you're back!

1835
01:39:32,772 --> 01:39:33,944
I missed you.

1836
01:39:35,575 --> 01:39:36,576
Thank God.

1837
01:39:43,983 --> 01:39:45,656
<i>- Gracie?
- Dad!</i>

1838
01:39:45,752 --> 01:39:47,254
<i>Are you guys still in the mountains?</i>

1839
01:39:47,320 --> 01:39:49,163
<i>What's going on?</i>

1840
01:39:49,255 --> 01:39:52,668
Well, you know, we're having so much fun.

1841
01:39:52,759 --> 01:39:56,798
<i>I'm so glad you guys
took a few days to unwind.</i>

1842
01:39:56,863 --> 01:39:58,433
<i>We've been having the best time.</i>

1843
01:39:59,199 --> 01:40:00,542
<i>I love being married.</i>

1844
01:40:02,035 --> 01:40:03,514
<i>Dad, how's Freeway?</i>

1845
01:40:03,603 --> 01:40:05,514
Freeway?

1846
01:40:05,605 --> 01:40:07,278
Freeway's fine.

1847
01:40:08,174 --> 01:40:09,517
You're back!

1848
01:40:09,609 --> 01:40:11,520
You're back, I knew it, I knew it.

1849
01:40:11,611 --> 01:40:13,612
Beth, I'm so happy for you.

1850
01:43:37,215 --> 01:43:38,489
Shut up!
