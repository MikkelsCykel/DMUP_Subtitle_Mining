00:00:55,854 --> 00:00:58,186
Um, so, anyway...

2
00:00:58,257 --> 00:01:00,782
thank you all so much
for being here and...

3
00:01:00,859 --> 00:01:04,351
<i>uh, let's eat some cake.</i>

4
00:01:15,407 --> 00:01:17,398
<i>Careful!</i>

5
00:01:20,045 --> 00:01:22,605
<i>- Ben, you're gonna drop me.
- I am gonna drop you.</i>

6
00:01:22,681 --> 00:01:25,673
God.

7
00:01:31,056 --> 00:01:34,048
- Mmm, stay just like that.
- Ben-

8
00:01:34,126 --> 00:01:37,618
<i>- Enough with the pictures!
- Come on!</i>

9
00:01:37,696 --> 00:01:40,529
You look beautiful!
They should be preserved for all of time.

10
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:42,863
This is what I get
for marrying a photographer.

11
00:01:45,437 --> 00:01:50,170
What are you doing
so far away from me?

12
00:01:50,242 --> 00:01:53,734
The most beautiful blushing bride
in all of Brooklyn.

13
00:01:53,812 --> 00:01:55,746
Oh.

14
00:01:58,717 --> 00:02:00,878
You have been wonderful
about this whole thing.

15
00:02:00,953 --> 00:02:03,547
- Yes, I have been wonderful.
- Yes, you have.

16
00:02:03,622 --> 00:02:05,556
I promise you, I will make it fun.

17
00:02:05,624 --> 00:02:08,286
Just think, the first stamp
in your new passport is gonna beJapan.

18
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,921
- How cool is that?
- That is cool. That is really cool.

19
00:02:14,032 --> 00:02:17,365
Well, the car will
be here in an hour.

20
00:02:17,436 --> 00:02:21,202
You better hurry up if you're gonna
get this thing consummated.

21
00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:43,146
God, look at that.

22
00:03:43,222 --> 00:03:47,158
- Mmm, it's beautiful, huh?
- It's gorgeous!

23
00:03:47,226 --> 00:03:49,194
Real quick. Get in the picture.

24
00:03:49,261 --> 00:03:52,924
Uh-oh.

25
00:04:17,623 --> 00:04:19,557
Ben.

26
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,052
Baby, I'm sorry.
Can you check the map?

27
00:04:23,128 --> 00:04:24,720
I am so lost. I think-

28
00:04:24,796 --> 00:04:27,629
- Sorry to wake you up.
- Mmm, it's okay.

29
00:04:33,805 --> 00:04:36,239
<i>Did you cross a bridge?</i>

30
00:04:36,308 --> 00:04:40,039
- What was the last thing that you passed?
- Uh, this intersection about-

31
00:05:28,126 --> 00:05:31,095
Jane. Jane?

32
00:05:31,163 --> 00:05:32,892
Jane, honey, are you okay?

33
00:05:32,964 --> 00:05:34,898
There was a girl.
We hit a girl.

34
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:42,330
<i>- There was a girl on the road.
- Okay. Okay.</i>

35
00:05:42,407 --> 00:05:44,967
I think she might be dead.

36
00:05:45,043 --> 00:05:47,477
- Jesus Christ.
- There's nothing here, Jane.

37
00:05:47,546 --> 00:05:51,073
- Oh, I might've killed someone.
- Janie, there's nothin' here.

38
00:05:51,149 --> 00:05:53,743
She could be covered in the snow.
Ben, we have to find her.

39
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:57,414
- Janie, there's no blood. There's nothing here.
- We have to find her.

40
00:05:57,489 --> 00:05:59,889
Let me get you back in the car.
It is freezing out here.

41
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:02,017
I'm gonna call the police.
I'll get us some help.

42
00:06:24,082 --> 00:06:26,016
- They can't just leave.
- Honey-

43
00:06:26,084 --> 00:06:29,884
They searched the woods.
They called the hospitals. There's nothing.

44
00:06:29,955 --> 00:06:32,822
They think we hit an animal.
You're absolutely positive that it was a girl?

45
00:06:32,891 --> 00:06:34,984
Ben, she was standing right here.

46
00:06:36,228 --> 00:06:39,664
Okay. Look, there's nothing else
we can do tonight.

47
00:06:39,731 --> 00:06:43,667
So can we please, please just go?

48
00:06:53,145 --> 00:06:56,114
Oh, man.

49
00:07:03,288 --> 00:07:06,553
Oh, man.

50
00:07:07,626 --> 00:07:09,560
I think I tweaked somethin'
back there.

51
00:07:15,133 --> 00:07:17,499
We did everything we could, Jane.

52
00:07:17,569 --> 00:07:21,972
<i>Look, we've only got a couple of days
before I start work. Let's try and enjoy it.</i>

53
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:25,066
What do you say
I make us some green tea?

54
00:07:25,143 --> 00:07:27,475
And then we can sleep for a year.

55
00:07:27,546 --> 00:07:29,480
<i>Maybe two.</i>

56
00:07:29,548 --> 00:07:31,709
Yeah.

57
00:07:50,936 --> 00:07:54,497
<i>Janie, I forgot how beautiful
the light is out here.</i>

58
00:07:54,573 --> 00:07:58,236
We have got-
To start taking some pictures.

59
00:08:01,646 --> 00:08:06,015
What would a girl have been doing in the
middle of the road wearing a dress like that?

60
00:08:06,084 --> 00:08:09,781
<i>Jane, honey,
we have talked about this.</i>

61
00:08:09,855 --> 00:08:12,915
If there was a girl- If-

62
00:08:12,991 --> 00:08:15,391
Then somebody must have stopped
and got her some help.

63
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:18,452
- I know. I just- I can't-
- Jane, please.

64
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:20,464
Stop being so dramatic about this.

65
00:08:20,532 --> 00:08:22,466
If there was a girl,
I promise you...

66
00:08:22,534 --> 00:08:26,061
she is somewhere right now sitting in bed,
eating ice cream and having her cast signed.

67
00:08:26,137 --> 00:08:28,901
Come with me, and let's take some photographs.

68
00:08:31,176 --> 00:08:35,135
- Baby, do they even have ice cream in Japan?
- Yes, they do.

69
00:08:35,213 --> 00:08:37,238
- But... it's fish flavored.
- Oh, okay.

70
00:08:37,315 --> 00:08:42,048
Right- No, no. Right-
Perfect. One second.

71
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,317
- Ben, it's really cold.
- I know. I'm comin'.

72
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,551
Okay, okay.
First, one for Mom.

73
00:08:47,626 --> 00:08:49,218
<i>A family portrait.</i>

74
00:08:50,729 --> 00:08:52,390
Can I press the button?

75
00:08:52,464 --> 00:08:53,988
- You wanna press the button?
- I wanna press the button.

76
00:08:56,067 --> 00:08:59,036
<i>- That's why they pay me the big bucks.
- Jane is cold.</i>

77
00:08:59,104 --> 00:09:02,096
<i>- Jane's cold.
- We should definitely, definitely warm Jane up.</i>

78
00:09:26,031 --> 00:09:27,020
<i>Ben-san!</i>

79
00:09:29,668 --> 00:09:32,159
Yoko.

80
00:09:38,176 --> 00:09:40,872
Yoko.

81
00:09:40,946 --> 00:09:42,208
- Oh.
- Hi.

82
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,043
Wife?

83
00:09:44,115 --> 00:09:46,879
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

84
00:09:46,952 --> 00:09:49,785
- And congratulations on the job.
- Thank you.

85
00:09:49,854 --> 00:09:51,788
<i>Ben-san!</i>

86
00:09:51,856 --> 00:09:53,847
- See ya.
- Bruno! Look at you!

87
00:09:53,925 --> 00:09:56,621
- Oh!
- Two years!

88
00:09:56,695 --> 00:09:58,629
- Like you never left.
- Maybe I shouldn't have.

89
00:09:58,697 --> 00:10:00,995
Oh, come on. Come on.
This must beJane.

90
00:10:01,066 --> 00:10:03,193
Uh, yes. Bruno, Jane.
Jane, Bruno.

91
00:10:03,268 --> 00:10:05,202
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

92
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:08,034
- Sorry I couldn't make it, but-
- Oh, Ben's told me so much about you.

93
00:10:08,106 --> 00:10:10,666
Oh, hopefully the good stuff.

94
00:10:10,742 --> 00:10:13,404
And I'm sorry we cut short
your honeymoon.

95
00:10:13,478 --> 00:10:15,969
In fact, I got the client
upstairs waiting.

96
00:10:16,047 --> 00:10:18,277
- Oh, don't worry about me. Go.
- Okay.

97
00:10:19,884 --> 00:10:22,648
<i>- Good luck.
- I'm sorry I'm late, man. The traffic was a killer.</i>

98
00:10:22,721 --> 00:10:25,189
<i>Don't worry about it.
You're the genius photographer.</i>

99
00:10:25,256 --> 00:10:28,692
<i>That's why I brought you out here.</i>

100
00:10:32,764 --> 00:10:36,200
We finalized the last of the models.
Did you get the Polaroids we sent over?

101
00:10:36,267 --> 00:10:38,997
I did get the Polaroids. There's a couple
I'd like to meet in person.

102
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:41,061
- Yeah, I bet there is.
- Oh, come on.

103
00:10:41,139 --> 00:10:43,471
Talk to Adam about that tomorrow.

104
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:45,771
Now, the clients are eager to get going.

105
00:10:45,844 --> 00:10:49,712
And I think I should mention they are
very pleased with our choice of photographer.

106
00:10:49,781 --> 00:10:51,908
- You ready?
- Ready.

107
00:11:12,103 --> 00:11:16,597
So, it's a loft conversion, but it's much nicer
on the inside. No, no. Let me get that.

108
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:22,374
All the comforts of home.

109
00:11:22,447 --> 00:11:24,438
Right this way.

110
00:11:26,518 --> 00:11:30,386
<i>Ah. Here is the photo studio.</i>

111
00:11:30,455 --> 00:11:32,389
<i>Come on in.</i>

112
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:41,394
Hi! Pleasure to meet you.

113
00:11:41,466 --> 00:11:44,799
Yes, this is your assistant.
Ben Shaw, Seiko Nakamura.

114
00:11:44,869 --> 00:11:47,838
And this is Ben's wife, Jane.

115
00:11:47,906 --> 00:11:50,101
- Hi, it's nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

116
00:11:50,175 --> 00:11:52,234
<i>- Does this work?
- Yeah.</i>

117
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,676
Let me show you
the darkroom over here...

118
00:11:54,746 --> 00:11:56,771
for the black-and-white prints.

119
00:12:00,552 --> 00:12:03,544
Yeah? Will it work?

120
00:12:03,621 --> 00:12:06,351
<i>- It's good?
- Yeah, yeah. Better than good.</i>

121
00:12:06,424 --> 00:12:09,518
Good. All right. Well, let's head upstairs,
and we'll check out the rest.

122
00:12:09,594 --> 00:12:13,621
<i>- People live here?
- Well, yours is the only actual completed unit.</i>

123
00:12:13,698 --> 00:12:16,098
So, you guys'll have
the whole place to yourselves.

124
00:12:16,167 --> 00:12:17,930
Be good for a couple
of newlyweds, huh?

125
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:30,179
We had, uh, most of this stuff
from another shoot.

126
00:12:30,248 --> 00:12:33,308
<i>- Figured they wouldn't miss it.
- You always were a sneaky bastard.</i>

127
00:12:34,619 --> 00:12:36,610
<i>I had, uh, Seiko rent the rest.</i>

128
00:12:37,856 --> 00:12:40,654
<i>- Not so bad, right?
- Are you kidding? It's great.</i>

129
00:12:42,827 --> 00:12:44,761
Look at this place.

130
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,201
<i>- Our stuff.
- I gotta get back to the office.</i>

131
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:54,101
Man, you set us up here.

132
00:12:54,172 --> 00:12:56,163
I want you to know
I really appreciate this job.

133
00:12:56,241 --> 00:12:59,369
Come on. You make me look good,
you being here.

134
00:12:59,444 --> 00:13:03,505
Besides, it'll just be like old times.

135
00:13:03,581 --> 00:13:06,880
<i>- Don't forget. Dinner with Adam.
- Sounds good to me.</i>

136
00:13:06,951 --> 00:13:08,475
All right. Good night.

137
00:13:10,255 --> 00:13:12,655
<i>It's huge!</i>

138
00:13:12,724 --> 00:13:16,888
- My God!
- And it's all ours!

139
00:13:16,961 --> 00:13:19,361
I mean, Janie,
did you see this view ofTokyo?

140
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:21,227
<i>I wish I'd brought up my camera.</i>

141
00:13:21,299 --> 00:13:25,258
<i>Well, too bad there is nothing else
that we could do...</i>

142
00:13:26,604 --> 00:13:28,970
up here.

143
00:13:36,981 --> 00:13:40,178
Mr. Ben Shaw.

144
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:45,984
<i>#All these things I say #</i>

145
00:13:47,192 --> 00:13:51,094
<i># The way you make me feel #</i>

146
00:13:51,162 --> 00:13:54,131
<i>#All these things I say #</i>

147
00:13:54,199 --> 00:13:56,224
<i># You are #</i>

148
00:13:56,301 --> 00:13:59,236
<i># Good to me #</i>

149
00:13:59,304 --> 00:14:01,272
<i># You are #</i>

150
00:14:01,339 --> 00:14:04,206
<i># Good to me #</i>

151
00:14:04,275 --> 00:14:05,742
<i># You are #</i>

152
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:08,108
<i># Good to me #</i>

153
00:15:01,933 --> 00:15:04,265
You gotta get that looked at, honey.

154
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,133
What's this?

155
00:15:11,209 --> 00:15:13,177
Just a little surprise.

156
00:15:14,712 --> 00:15:17,112
It's the honeymoon photographs.
I gave Bruno the film last night.

157
00:15:17,181 --> 00:15:20,014
Seiko just dropped them off.

158
00:15:22,053 --> 00:15:23,953
Oh, God, I look hideous.

159
00:15:26,524 --> 00:15:28,287
What's this?

160
00:15:30,561 --> 00:15:32,791
I don't know.
Reflection, maybe?

161
00:15:32,864 --> 00:15:35,230
Or it could just be
a bad frame on the roll.

162
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,326
- No, it's in a couple of'em.
- Really? Hmm.

163
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:42,828
Maybe I misloaded the film.

164
00:15:42,907 --> 00:15:46,035
Well, if that's the case,
then we'll just have to reshoot.

165
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:47,338
Mmm.

166
00:15:47,412 --> 00:15:50,313
Enjoy your first day in Tokyo.

167
00:16:34,926 --> 00:16:37,690
<i>Open your eyes. Just like that.</i>

168

00:16:40,264 --> 00:16:42,232
<i>Just like that.
Eyes to me.</i>

170

Just like that.
Eyes to me.

171
00:16:44,302 --> 00:16:47,396
Can you drop your hand off the bottle
just a little- Right there. Perfect.

172
00:16:47,472 --> 00:16:48,939
<i>Hold that. Last couple.</i>

173
00:16:50,608 --> 00:16:53,975
Lovely. Uh, perfect.

174
00:16:54,045 --> 00:16:57,105
Okay. Can you bring your hand down
just a little bit on the bottle?

175
00:16:57,181 --> 00:16:58,910
A little more, more, more.
Okay. Right there, perfect.

176
00:16:58,983 --> 00:17:00,883
<i>Hold that.
Last couple frames.</i>

177
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:10,293
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

178
00:17:10,361 --> 00:17:14,058
Can you show me how to get to-
I'm looking for, uh-

179

<i>Super Lucky!</i>

00:18:01,746 --> 00:18:03,680
Sorry. Sorry.

181
00:18:11,889 --> 00:18:13,083
- Hey.
- Hi.

182
00:18:13,157 --> 00:18:15,091
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

183
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:18,026
- How was your first day in Tokyo?
- Uh, it was, um-

184
00:18:18,096 --> 00:18:20,360
- Mmm.
- Good. Rainy.

185
00:18:20,431 --> 00:18:23,366
Yeah, you're soaked.
Let's get you out of this.

186
00:18:23,434 --> 00:18:27,461
- Thank you.
- Megan called. She's sending over the photos from the wedding.

187
00:18:27,538 --> 00:18:29,699
Oh, that's nice.
I should give her a call.

188
00:18:29,774 --> 00:18:33,403
You could,
but it's 3:00 a. m. In New York.

189
00:18:33,478 --> 00:18:35,946
- Yesterday.
- Oh. Mmm.

190
00:18:36,013 --> 00:18:38,379
- How was your day?
- It's... the office.

191
00:18:38,449 --> 00:18:41,247
This'll only take a second.
Thank you.

192

<i>- Moshi moshi.
- So, where'd you go?</i>

193
00:18:44,522 --> 00:18:48,185

- Can I see your pictures?

194
00:18:48,259 --> 00:18:51,057
Sure. They're just tourist shots.

Oh, God.

196

What?

197
00:19:03,107 --> 00:19:05,541
Spirit photos.

198

Hold on.
You know wh-what these are?

199
00:19:10,414 --> 00:19:14,111
Yeah. My ex-boyfriend works
at a spirit photography magazine.

200
00:19:14,185 --> 00:19:17,848
- There are whole magazines?
- Yeah.

201
00:19:17,922 --> 00:19:21,619
Any in English?

202
00:19:21,692 --> 00:19:24,593
Um, I can introduce you tomorrow, uh,
after the photo shoot.

203
00:19:24,662 --> 00:19:26,687
- Come on. It'll be fun.
- Um-

204
00:19:26,764 --> 00:19:28,891
That's cute.
You girls have a date.

205
00:19:28,966 --> 00:19:32,561
- Uh-Well, I guess so.
- Great.

206
00:19:39,477 --> 00:19:41,741

- Lovely to meet you.
- It's a pleasure to meet you.

- I got your cane right here.

00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:08,961
So, what do you do when you're not
traveling the world with this guy?

215
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,474
Actually, I just became certified
to teach sixth-grade English.

216
00:20:11,542 --> 00:20:13,635
Really?
Well, that must be pretty fulfilling.

00:20:13,711 --> 00:20:17,238
No, I-

218
00:20:21,219 --> 00:20:24,655
<i>So, hey, Bru, you remember that Russian
hostess from the other night?</i>

219
00:20:24,722 --> 00:20:26,587
- No.
- Yeah, I called her.

220
00:20:26,657 --> 00:20:29,888
She's comin' in
for an audition on Wednesday.

221
00:20:29,961 --> 00:20:32,156
- Unbelievable, this guy.
- Some things never change.

222
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:35,324
Hey, it's my job.

- Um-

225
00:20:39,837 --> 00:20:43,364
I, um, I rep models.

226

Um, and I got this guy all the girls
he's workin' with the next two weeks.

Ah. You guys make quite the team,

228
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,307
<i>- Certainly did.

00:21:09,634 --> 00:21:11,568
Perfect. Okay. Hold that.

Okay. That's enough color.
Let's shoot some black-and-white.

237
00:21:26,784 --> 00:21:30,720
See, uh, right up there? That's my office,
right up there in the corner.

<i>- That's your office?
- Clear frame, please. Bruno!</i>

- Be plenty of time for that later.

240
00:21:35,626 --> 00:21:37,856
<i>All right.</i>

- What?

244
00:22:05,856 --> 00:22:07,517
What did you just say to me?

245
00:22:07,591 --> 00:22:08,956
Nothing.

246
00:22:13,197 --> 00:22:16,030
Okay. Here we go.

247
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,261
Uh, Sandra, can you

- Ritsuo?

255
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:27,633
Sorry. L- I was wondering if you could
tell me where you get your photos from.

256
00:23:27,705 --> 00:23:31,141
- Oh, he's a fake.
- Oh. Shh.

257
00:23:32,843 --> 00:23:36,973
Look. Our readers want to see scary photos.
And real ones are hard to find.

258
00:23:37,047 --> 00:23:39,811
So, it's not a big deal.

259
00:23:39,884 --> 00:23:41,818
Right, so none of this is real.

260
00:23:43,454 --> 00:23:47,618
I didn't say that. Look, I started
this magazine three years ago.

261
00:23:50,261 --> 00:23:53,492
<i>And this is the first photo
we ever published.</i>

262
00:23:55,699 --> 00:23:58,065
That's me in the photo.

263
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:02,130
It was taken after my mother
had passed away.

264
00:24:08,712 --> 00:24:10,646
It's real.

265
00:24:10,714 --> 00:24:13,512
But that's just one picture.

266
00:24:16,554 --> 00:24:19,921
Come on.
I want to show you something.

267

<i>We didn't fake these.</i>

268
00:24:58,028 --> 00:25:02,727
<i>You know, spirit photography
has been around since the 1800s-</i>

269
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,234
<i>as long as photography itself.</i>

270
00:25:05,302 --> 00:25:09,568
All across the world,
these images have always appeared...

271
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:12,200
<i>connecting us with the unseen.</i>

272
00:25:14,979 --> 00:25:18,471
<i>And I think they're trying
to tell us something.</i>

273
00:25:18,549 --> 00:25:20,244
Like what?

274
00:25:20,317 --> 00:25:22,376
Well, depends on the people
and the pictures.

275
00:25:24,255 --> 00:25:26,450
<i>Unrequited love.</i>

276
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:30,085
<i>Maybe you've had an unfinished business
with a dead relative.</i>

277
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:34,824
<i>Could be your father,
mother, children.</i>

278
00:25:34,899 --> 00:25:38,835
<i>- I've seen pictures where
living people have appeared.</i>

279
00:25:41,672 --> 00:25:44,573
I think it's a case of strong emotions
making themselves heard.

280
00:25:47,311 --> 00:25:50,405
<i>- Like a message.
- Yes.</i>

281
00:25:50,481 --> 00:25:55,441
<i>Think about it. Why all that effort
if you don't have something to say?</i>

282
00:26:19,043 --> 00:26:24,811
<i>You know, if you're interested,
wejust did a big story on a local medium.</i>

283
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:28,184
What?

284
00:26:29,186 --> 00:26:31,677
He's a powerful spiritualist.

285
00:26:31,755 --> 00:26:35,282
We had him take a look
at a bunch of photos. Here.

286
00:26:37,027 --> 00:26:41,691
Does this mean that you can't tell
which ones are real or which ones are fakes?

287
00:26:41,765 --> 00:26:44,734
I know that you can't fake a Polaroid.
There's no negative.

288
00:26:48,238 --> 00:26:50,729
You load the film,
you push a shutter.

289
00:26:52,543 --> 00:26:55,842
And out comes a photo.
How are you gonna fake that?

290
00:26:55,913 --> 00:27:00,373
<i>Maybe you should take a picture of your girlfriend.
My spirit doesn't really like her.</i>

291
00:27:00,451 --> 00:27:03,215
Well, then maybe I should
take pictures of you.

292
00:27:07,124 --> 00:27:09,251
<i>Hey, where are you going with that?</i>

304
00:30:14,444 --> 00:30:18,107
I need to get back.
Please, somebody help!

00:30:34,431 --> 00:30:36,524
<i>They looked. It's on the negatives.</i>

307
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,898
<i>Then why didn't we
see anything in the Polaroids?</i>

308
00:30:38,969 --> 00:30:41,267
<i>Then they must have damaged it
at the lab!</i>

309
00:30:45,709 --> 00:30:50,578
- Just tell me this is not my fault.
- Hey.

310
00:30:52,115 --> 00:30:54,140
What's going on?

311
00:30:55,452 --> 00:30:57,647
The film from today's shoot
is ruined.

312
00:31:00,023 --> 00:31:02,321
Okay, I'm gonna go.

313
00:31:04,628 --> 00:31:06,562
- Bye, Jane.
- Bye.

314
00:31:16,206 --> 00:31:18,868
How bad is it?
Can you reshoot?

315
00:31:18,942 --> 00:31:22,241
No. Not without blowing the budget
and the schedule.

316
00:31:22,312 --> 00:31:24,280
- That's if they'd even let me.
- It was a mistake.

317
00:31:24,348 --> 00:31:26,942
- These things happen.
- Yes, it was.

318
00:31:27,017 --> 00:31:30,282
<i>A very embarrassing,
very expensive mistake.</i>

319
00:31:37,527 --> 00:31:39,461
<i>We've seen this before.</i>

320
00:31:39,529 --> 00:31:41,326
Like the pictures from the cabin.

321
00:31:42,833 --> 00:31:44,767
Well, it makes sense.
It's the same camera.

322
00:31:44,835 --> 00:31:47,633
It must've got
banged up in the crash.

323
00:31:47,704 --> 00:31:49,797
And, uh, somethin' got in the body,
or there's a light leak.

324
00:31:49,873 --> 00:31:51,898
I don't know. But I'm lucky
I didn't get fired today.

325
00:31:51,975 --> 00:31:55,342
- If it wasn't for Bruno-
- I saw her.

326
00:31:57,014 --> 00:31:59,005
<i>Who?</i>

327
00:31:59,082 --> 00:32:02,176
The girl from the road.

328
00:32:04,121 --> 00:32:07,852
She followed us to Tokyo.

329
00:32:07,925 --> 00:32:09,984
Well, great, great.
That means she's okay.

330
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:14,997
No, she's- She's not-
She's not okay, Ben. Christ, she-

331
00:32:18,101 --> 00:32:20,092
I think she's dead.

332
00:32:24,107 --> 00:32:26,769
Janie.

333
00:32:26,843 --> 00:32:29,607
Janie, look. I know that this
has been difficult for you.

334
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:33,548
- And it's completely understandable given-
- I know. I know. I know.

335
00:32:33,617 --> 00:32:38,247
I know what it sounds like.
I know it sounds crazy. But just think about it.

336
00:32:39,489 --> 00:32:44,517
Ben, have you seen
or felt anything strange?

337
00:32:44,594 --> 00:32:46,687
Anything at all.
Anything since the crash.

338
00:32:46,763 --> 00:32:49,357
Jane, I haven't seen any ghosts.

339
00:32:49,433 --> 00:32:52,425
- Don't be like that.
- But that's what this is about, right?

340
00:32:52,502 --> 00:32:54,993
I mean, that's what you're saying.
Listen to yourself.

341
00:32:55,072 --> 00:32:57,267
Do you hear what
you're saying, Jane? Ghosts?

342
00:32:57,341 --> 00:33:00,469
I mean, look. I wish I could
quit my job. I do.

343
00:33:00,544 --> 00:33:04,275
I wish I could spend every moment
of every day with you, but I can't.

344
00:33:04,348 --> 00:33:06,509
- I have to work.
- I've never asked you to hold my hand.

345
00:33:06,583 --> 00:33:08,608
- I've never asked you-
- But, Jane, that's what this is about!

346
00:33:08,685 --> 00:33:11,552
Now, come on!
Today is just not the day. I'm sorry.

347
00:33:11,621 --> 00:33:14,715
I'm sorry, Jane, but, Jesus,
I'm just not your fucking father.

348
00:33:22,032 --> 00:33:23,966
God.

349
00:34:48,118 --> 00:34:51,144
I see no sign of serious injury.

350
00:34:51,221 --> 00:34:54,315
I can give you something for the pain.

351
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:59,717
Honey, I'm really sorry about last night.

352
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:06,686
That's probably the agency.

353
00:36:06,763 --> 00:36:10,199
<i>I'll be right back.</i>

354
00:36:10,267 --> 00:36:13,600
<i>- Moshi moshi.
- Hi. It's me.</i>

355
00:36:15,872 --> 00:36:19,364
Hey, let's not fight anymore.
I'm sorry about the whole thing.

356
00:36:19,442 --> 00:36:22,275
Well, I was thinking
I'd make you dinner.

357
00:36:30,086 --> 00:36:32,577
Ben? Are you there?

358
00:37:16,933 --> 00:37:20,334
<i>No! God!</i>

359
00:37:29,512 --> 00:37:30,809
Ben!

360
00:37:49,232 --> 00:37:51,359
Ben?

361
00:38:12,055 --> 00:38:14,683
Ben?

362
00:38:19,896 --> 00:38:23,764
I'm so sorry.
Honey, I'm so sorry.

363
00:38:25,568 --> 00:38:28,503
You saw her.

364
00:38:28,571 --> 00:38:32,234
I think maybe the stress is gettin' to me.

365
00:38:32,309 --> 00:38:34,607
But you saw the girl.

366
00:38:39,916 --> 00:38:42,009
Seiko took me
to meet her ex-boyfriend.

367
00:38:44,087 --> 00:38:47,887
He told me that emotional energy
can be communicated on film.

368
00:38:49,192 --> 00:38:51,126
I know. I know.

369
00:38:51,194 --> 00:38:53,992
But all of your ruined photos?

370
00:38:54,064 --> 00:38:58,967
Everything that's happened-
I think it's that girl from the road.

371
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:03,567
She's angry at me
for what I did to her.

372
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,232
There's a man that people go to...

373
00:39:05,308 --> 00:39:07,742
to... cleanse their spirits.

374
00:39:07,811 --> 00:39:11,372
I think he should take a look at our pictures.

375
00:39:11,448 --> 00:39:14,542
- Jane, a fortuneteller?
- Please. I need you.

376
00:39:15,552 --> 00:39:17,713
What can it hurt?

377
00:39:28,565 --> 00:39:30,829
We can go in.

378
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:34,768
We saw your article.

379
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:40,006
Well, we wanted to know.
What are these?

380
00:39:45,515 --> 00:39:47,608
What are you?

381
00:39:47,684 --> 00:39:49,413
Not the skin.

382
00:39:49,486 --> 00:39:53,115
This is not us.

383
00:39:54,391 --> 00:39:57,019
We are spirit.

384
00:39:59,396 --> 00:40:02,524
Just alive.
The spirit is energy.

385
00:40:04,768 --> 00:40:07,032
When the body dies, the flesh rots.

386
00:40:07,103 --> 00:40:09,594
The spirit leaves,
but the energy remains.

387
00:40:11,808 --> 00:40:14,538
<i>Light is energy.</i>

388
00:40:14,611 --> 00:40:16,602
The camera catches light.

389
00:40:18,014 --> 00:40:20,642
That's how this works.

390
00:40:22,252 --> 00:40:25,653
But what makes them appear?

391
00:40:29,125 --> 00:40:30,786
Passion twists the spirit.

392
00:40:31,795 --> 00:40:36,994
Too much desire...
or love... or hate.

393
00:40:39,369 --> 00:40:43,829
The spirit becomes...
locked to the body.

394
00:40:46,176 --> 00:40:48,110
Trapped in death.

395
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:55,044
Mr. Murase, we had an accident.

396
00:41:40,263 --> 00:41:42,197
- He's talkin' crazy.
- Wait, what is he saying?

397
00:41:42,265 --> 00:41:44,426
<i>- He's saying we're on our own.
- I think he's trying to help us.</i>

398
00:41:44,501 --> 00:41:46,196
<i>We're leaving. Come on!</i>

399
00:41:46,269 --> 00:41:48,066
Sorry.

400
00:41:48,137 --> 00:41:50,264
He said there's nothin' he can do.

401
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:52,501
But why? Did he say anything
that can help us?

402
00:41:52,575 --> 00:41:56,568
The guy's a fake, a scam artist, okay?
We're wasting our time here.

403
00:41:56,646 --> 00:42:00,377
<i>Seiko. Hey, it's me.</i>

404
00:42:02,552 --> 00:42:03,985
Hey, everybody.
I'm sorry I'm late.

405
00:42:04,053 --> 00:42:07,147
I cannot talk about this right now.
Can we talk about it later?

406
00:42:07,223 --> 00:42:10,283
Okay? Later.
Sorry, everybody.

407
00:42:55,438 --> 00:42:57,372
<i>T.G.K.</i>

408
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,170
Seiko?

409
00:43:00,243 --> 00:43:03,542
Do you guys have a-a Polaroid camera
that I could borrow?

410
00:45:39,502 --> 00:45:41,436
Where are you?

411
00:47:19,702 --> 00:47:21,932
<i>See you tomorrow at 8::00.</i>

412
00:47:22,004 --> 00:47:24,632
- See you tomorrow. Thanks for your help today.
- My pleasure.

413
00:47:50,499 --> 00:47:52,433
Oh!

414
00:48:04,947 --> 00:48:07,780
Hey, I'm still in here!

415
00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:10,410
Hello!

416
00:48:13,623 --> 00:48:17,354
Jane? Is that you?

417
00:48:17,426 --> 00:48:19,417
Shit.

418
00:48:19,495 --> 00:48:22,259
Look, this isn't funny anymore!
Turn on the lights.

419
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:33,204
Hello?

420
00:48:53,562 --> 00:48:57,658
Who's there?
Who's there?

421
00:48:57,733 --> 00:48:59,462
Hey!

422
00:49:12,315 --> 00:49:14,977
You know who she is.

423
00:49:25,161 --> 00:49:27,152
Megumi was a translator.

424
00:49:27,229 --> 00:49:29,197
Good. Excuse me, miss.

425
00:49:29,265 --> 00:49:34,328
<i>Could you come forward a little bit
andjust tuck in? All right.</i>

426
00:49:34,403 --> 00:49:37,031
<i>I don't think she'd ever
had a serious relationship before.</i>

427
00:49:40,443 --> 00:49:44,038
<i>Me, us, herjob-</i>

428
00:49:44,113 --> 00:49:47,344
<i>they meant freedom
from her home life.</i>

429
00:49:47,416 --> 00:49:50,408
<i>- Her father was very traditional.
He didn't approve.</i>

430
00:49:50,486 --> 00:49:54,718
<i>- This is for you.
- She wanted to spend more and more time at my place.</i>

431
00:49:54,790 --> 00:49:59,352
<i>Oh, my God.
You really shouldn't have done this.</i>

432
00:49:59,428 --> 00:50:02,761
Her father died suddenly.
He'd been sick for a while.

433
00:50:05,234 --> 00:50:10,262
<i>- After that, she was different. Needy.
- Ben.</i>

434
00:50:10,339 --> 00:50:12,273
<i>I knew she was suffering,
but there was nothing I could do.</i>

435
00:50:12,341 --> 00:50:16,437
I just wasn't falling in love with her.
She sensed it.

436
00:50:16,512 --> 00:50:19,709
- It only made her more intense, obsessive.
- Ben.

437
00:50:19,782 --> 00:50:23,718
<i>Maybe I didn't understand
what our relationship meant to her...</i>

438
00:50:23,786 --> 00:50:26,311
<i>how much it cost her.</i>

439
00:50:26,389 --> 00:50:30,826
She was dangerous, Jane.
She was going to hurt someone- herself.

440
00:50:30,893 --> 00:50:33,123
- Don't leave me!
- Put that- Put it down!

441
00:50:33,195 --> 00:50:35,595
- This has got to stop. It has to stop.
- No!

442
00:50:35,664 --> 00:50:37,825
I can't do this anymore.

443
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:39,663
<i>She wouldn't listen to me.</i>

444
00:50:39,735 --> 00:50:43,171
<i>She wouldn't leave me alone.</i>

445
00:50:43,239 --> 00:50:46,106
<i>She followed me everywhere.</i>

446
00:50:46,175 --> 00:50:49,576
<i>- Bruno and Adam said they'd talk to her.
- And?</i>

447
00:50:49,645 --> 00:50:55,140
And they told her to stop,
that it was over.

448
00:50:55,217 --> 00:50:58,311
That it was over,
that she was making a fool of herself.

449
00:50:58,387 --> 00:51:00,947
<i>After that, I never saw her again.</i>

450
00:51:01,023 --> 00:51:02,991
You just pushed her away.

451
00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:06,085
<i>- Janie, look, I know I didn't handle this well.
- But what was she doing there?</i>

452
00:51:06,162 --> 00:51:08,926
<i>- Why was she on that road?
- I don't know.</i>

453
00:51:08,998 --> 00:51:10,932
I don't know.
She must have been following me.

454
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,867
<i>I know I should've told you...</i>

455
00:51:13,936 --> 00:51:16,427
but that's just not the easiest thing
to tell your new wife.

456
00:51:16,505 --> 00:51:19,440
But now,
Christ, this whole thing-

457
00:51:21,010 --> 00:51:24,104
It's just so crazy.

458
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:26,273
Maybe we should get out of here.

459
00:51:26,348 --> 00:51:29,181
Just go back to New York.
What do you think?

460
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:33,147
Really? Well, what about the shoot?

461
00:51:33,222 --> 00:51:35,156
Screw the job.
I can get another job.

462
00:51:35,224 --> 00:51:37,215
But I will not risk you.

463
00:51:41,931 --> 00:51:43,922
Yes.

464
00:51:54,577 --> 00:51:57,637
- Hello?
- Hey, man, am I waking you?

465
00:51:57,713 --> 00:52:00,238
No, no. I'm just watching TV.

466
00:52:00,316 --> 00:52:03,046
- What's goin' on?
- I've been thinking about Megumi.

467
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:06,111
<i>You know what ever happened to her?</i>

468
00:52:07,356 --> 00:52:10,052
You know, it's funny.
I saw her the other day.

469
00:52:10,126 --> 00:52:12,185
What? Are you sure?

470
00:52:12,261 --> 00:52:14,252
<i>- Yeah.
- What did she say?</i>

471
00:52:14,330 --> 00:52:17,231
Nothing. She was just on the street.

472
00:52:17,299 --> 00:52:20,029
She was pointing at me,
and I just went the other way.

473
00:52:20,102 --> 00:52:22,036
She kind of creeps me out, man.

474
00:52:22,104 --> 00:52:26,336
<i>- But you were absolutely certain it was her.
- Yeah.</i>

475
00:52:26,408 --> 00:52:28,342
<i>Who are you talking to?</i>

476
00:52:28,410 --> 00:52:30,844
<i>Uh, it's nobody, hon.
I'll be right there.</i>

477
00:52:30,913 --> 00:52:33,609
Bruno, I'm sorry, man.
Can I call you in the morning?

478
00:52:33,682 --> 00:52:36,014
Okay.

479
00:52:47,296 --> 00:52:49,230
If I'd have known
this was necessary...

480
00:52:49,298 --> 00:52:51,323
I would've worn something
a little nicer.

481
00:52:53,469 --> 00:52:56,267
That's gonna be just fine.

482
00:53:06,415 --> 00:53:08,645
I'm a little bit nervous.

483
00:53:08,717 --> 00:53:11,652
Oh, just pretend I'm a customer
at your restaurant.

484
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:15,121
<i>Ha. I don't usually wait tables
in my underwear.</i>

485
00:53:16,692 --> 00:53:19,058
There's always a first time
for everything.

486
00:53:24,033 --> 00:53:26,024
You've gotta be kidding me.

487
00:53:26,101 --> 00:53:30,003
You wanna be a fashion model.
Your test photos need a little bit of fashion.

488
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:46,788
Nice.

489
00:53:50,492 --> 00:53:53,290
- Giddyap, cowboy.
- I will.

490
00:53:58,367 --> 00:54:02,303
Look, I'm not gonna keep posing
if you're not gonna take the picture.

491
00:54:02,371 --> 00:54:04,771
Um, I'm gonna keep
taking the pictures.

492
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:07,308
Um, let's move to the stairs, yeah?
Come on.

493
00:54:07,376 --> 00:54:09,970
All right.

494
00:54:14,917 --> 00:54:17,852
You are seriously beautiful.

495
00:54:43,345 --> 00:54:46,405
It's Bruno.

496
00:54:46,482 --> 00:54:50,111
- Hey, man. Uh-
- There's been an accident.

497
00:54:50,185 --> 00:54:53,416
- It's, uh, Adam.
- Oh, God. What kind of accident?

498
00:54:53,489 --> 00:54:56,617
They don't know. Um-
They don't know.

499
00:54:56,692 --> 00:54:58,683
Where are they keeping him?
We'll come right now.

500
00:54:58,761 --> 00:55:03,061
- He's in a hospital in Shinjuku.
- Okay. See you there.

501
00:55:34,997 --> 00:55:39,058
- Bruno should've been here.
- Try him again.

502
00:55:56,151 --> 00:55:58,881
Hello?

503
00:55:58,954 --> 00:56:03,948
Bruno. Look, man,
we really need you down here.

504
00:56:04,026 --> 00:56:06,017
Adam didn't make it.

505
00:56:27,950 --> 00:56:30,111
Bruno?

506
00:56:33,455 --> 00:56:35,389
Bruno.

507
00:56:49,571 --> 00:56:52,096
Bruno?

508
00:56:52,174 --> 00:56:54,108
<i>Bruno.</i>

509
00:57:31,079 --> 00:57:33,013
Bruno?

510
00:57:48,964 --> 00:57:51,228
<i>Bruno?</i>

511
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:53,200
Bruno. Stop.

512
00:57:53,268 --> 00:57:56,999
<i>- Bruno! Bruno!
- No! No!</i>

513
00:57:57,072 --> 00:58:01,600
Bruno! Bruno!

514
00:58:23,165 --> 00:58:25,429
He was cutting up photos.

515
00:58:26,835 --> 00:58:28,826
<i>It's not a coincidence.</i>

516
00:58:32,107 --> 00:58:34,041
<i>I know.</i>

517
00:58:35,644 --> 00:58:37,635
She killed them.

518
00:58:37,713 --> 00:58:40,238
<i>She killed my friends.</i>

519
00:58:40,315 --> 00:58:42,613
<i>- Why them? We're the ones who hit her.
- I don't know.</i>

520
00:58:42,684 --> 00:58:45,949
And we can't stay here.

521
00:58:55,697 --> 00:58:57,631
It must be from Megan.

522
00:59:06,174 --> 00:59:09,075
Okay. I got the tickets.
We can change them at the counter.

523
00:59:09,144 --> 00:59:11,078
<i>We're not going anywhere.</i>

524
00:59:26,028 --> 00:59:28,826
These pictures were taken
before the crash.

525
00:59:28,897 --> 00:59:32,492
- How can she possibly-
- This isn't about the crash.

526
00:59:32,568 --> 00:59:34,593
She was with us before we got here.

527
00:59:34,670 --> 00:59:37,571
<i>She's been with us all along.</i>

528
00:59:41,176 --> 00:59:43,770
The medium said that spirits
are tied to the flesh.

529
00:59:45,013 --> 00:59:46,947
Even in death.

530
00:59:49,117 --> 00:59:51,108
Ben, we have to find her.

531
00:59:57,693 --> 01:00:01,527
<i>Megumi had a house a few hours
outside of Tokyo. We can start there.</i>

532
01:00:38,266 --> 01:00:40,257
<i>Hello?</i>

533
01:00:42,337 --> 01:00:44,328
<i>Is anyone there?</i>

534
01:01:36,224 --> 01:01:39,318
Come on. She's not here.
Let's go.

535
01:01:39,394 --> 01:01:41,328
<i>Wait.</i>

536
01:01:41,396 --> 01:01:43,455
Did you hear that?

537
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:54,638
<i>Ben.</i>

538
01:02:04,386 --> 01:02:06,115
Come on.

539
01:02:36,017 --> 01:02:38,008
Megumi?

540
01:02:54,536 --> 01:02:57,300
Megumi?

541
01:03:01,610 --> 01:03:03,544
<i>Megumi.</i>

542
01:03:21,563 --> 01:03:23,963
<i>Police said Megumi's funeral will be tomorrow.</i>

543
01:03:24,032 --> 01:03:25,966
<i>She'll be cremated.</i>

544
01:03:26,034 --> 01:03:28,025
<i>And then we can go home.</i>

545
01:05:26,788 --> 01:05:29,689
Jane! Jane.

546
01:05:29,758 --> 01:05:31,749
What's the matter?

547
01:05:31,826 --> 01:05:34,226
Ben?

548
01:05:37,432 --> 01:05:39,366
Ben, what is it, baby?

549
01:05:41,303 --> 01:05:44,830
- I had a dream. I had a dream.
- Oh.

550
01:05:44,906 --> 01:05:47,306
- Was it a bad dream?
- Just a dream.

551
01:08:13,021 --> 01:08:14,511
Ben?

552
01:08:14,589 --> 01:08:17,922
Ben? Ben!

553
01:08:19,027 --> 01:08:20,494
Ben!

554
01:08:22,931 --> 01:08:24,296
Ben, it's- Ben!

555
01:08:27,068 --> 01:08:29,628
Ben! Ben! Stop! No!

556
01:08:29,704 --> 01:08:32,332
Please! Ben! Ben!

557
01:08:32,407 --> 01:08:34,375
Oh, my God! Oh!

558
01:08:34,442 --> 01:08:36,933
Ben?

559
01:08:37,011 --> 01:08:39,002
Ben?

560
01:08:42,484 --> 01:08:46,181
Get out! Leave us alone!

561
01:08:46,254 --> 01:08:49,417
Do you hear me?

562
01:08:53,661 --> 01:08:56,027
Aaah! Help me!

563
01:09:05,273 --> 01:09:08,106
Oh, God! He left you
because he never loved you!

564
01:09:14,749 --> 01:09:17,047
Ben!

565
01:09:32,433 --> 01:09:35,061
Oh!

566
01:09:37,505 --> 01:09:39,735
Oh! I got you.

567
01:11:08,830 --> 01:11:10,821
- Have a safe flight.
- Thank you.

568
01:11:16,070 --> 01:11:18,004
- Bye.
- Take care.

569
01:17:06,988 --> 01:17:08,580
Hey. I'm back.

570
01:17:09,757 --> 01:17:13,386
<i>Janie? I got the cheesecake.</i>

571
01:17:16,530 --> 01:17:18,555
What's goin' on?

572
01:17:28,943 --> 01:17:30,934
Where did you get those?

573
01:17:35,850 --> 01:17:37,909
Stop.

574
01:17:43,090 --> 01:17:47,049
- I said stop, Jane.
- What happened?

575
01:17:47,128 --> 01:17:50,359
What did you do to that girl?

576
01:17:51,799 --> 01:17:55,132
- Honey, it's not what you-
- What did you do to her?

577
01:17:58,806 --> 01:18:02,936
Baby, you don't know
what it was like.

578
01:18:03,010 --> 01:18:04,875
She was crazy.

579
01:18:04,945 --> 01:18:08,312
<i>Janie, I didn't know what to do.
She wouldn't stop.</i>

580
01:18:08,382 --> 01:18:11,317
<i>Adam said he had some pills.</i>

581
01:18:11,385 --> 01:18:14,479
<i>Uh, like sleeping pills.
Just a little bit stronger.</i>

582
01:18:17,458 --> 01:18:20,450
One drink.
I just wanted to say that I'm sorry.

583
01:18:25,833 --> 01:18:27,926
<i>- Kanpai.
- Kanpai.</i>

584
01:18:37,144 --> 01:18:39,942
All we were gonna do
is take pictures.

585
01:18:40,014 --> 01:18:42,744
Then, if she wouldn't stop,
I could use them against her.

586
01:18:42,817 --> 01:18:46,014
<i>I could show them to people at work,
show them to her mother.</i>

587
01:18:49,256 --> 01:18:52,225
It sounded okay
when we talked about it.

588
01:18:52,293 --> 01:18:54,921
<i>- Ben.
- Come on.</i>

589
01:18:54,995 --> 01:18:59,659
- Just let me get a light.
- Come on. What are you waiting for?

590
01:18:59,734 --> 01:19:02,202
<i>- Ben?
- Come on, man! Take the picture.</i>

591
01:19:02,269 --> 01:19:05,363
<i>- Don't leave us hangin'here.
- Ben?</i>

592
01:19:05,439 --> 01:19:07,168
<i>- Ben?
- Hey, hey, hey. Easy.</i>

593
01:19:07,241 --> 01:19:10,142
<i>- It's all right.
- It's fun. Don't worry about it.</i>

594
01:19:10,211 --> 01:19:13,942
Hey, it's okay.
Yeah, don't worry about it. It's fine.

595
01:19:14,014 --> 01:19:17,279
<i>You kiss a cheek too.</i>

596
01:19:17,351 --> 01:19:19,649
- Ben.
- That look good?

597
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:23,212
<i>No, no, no, no. We're good.
We're good right here.</i>

598
01:19:23,290 --> 01:19:26,851
<i>Great pills.</i>

599
01:19:26,927 --> 01:19:28,724
<i>Did you get this?</i>

600
01:19:28,796 --> 01:19:30,559
Come on.
Where you goin'?

601
01:19:30,631 --> 01:19:34,192
- Ben. Ben!
- Where you goin', man? Come on.

602
01:19:34,268 --> 01:19:37,294
Let's do it on the floor.

603
01:19:37,371 --> 01:19:39,498
- Yeah, you got her?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

604
01:19:43,444 --> 01:19:45,674
She's strong.

605
01:19:48,716 --> 01:19:51,207
<i>- Aah! That's a girl.
- Adam, hold her down.</i>

606
01:19:51,285 --> 01:19:53,219
<i>Ben!</i>

607
01:19:53,287 --> 01:19:55,187
<i>Don't struggle!</i>

608
01:20:01,128 --> 01:20:03,392
Janie, I know it was wrong.

609
01:20:03,464 --> 01:20:06,763
I know I should've done something.
But I didn't touch that girl.

610
01:20:06,834 --> 01:20:10,361
<i>- What?
- I didn't touch her. I just took the pictures.</i>

611
01:20:10,437 --> 01:20:14,430
- It was Adam and Bruno who took that thing way too far.
- That's why she killed them!

612
01:20:15,609 --> 01:20:17,668
But not me.

613
01:20:19,079 --> 01:20:21,070
It was a warning.

614
01:20:22,783 --> 01:20:26,184
<i>She wanted me to see
the man that she knew.</i>

615
01:20:26,253 --> 01:20:28,585
She was trying to help me.

616
01:20:28,656 --> 01:20:31,420
- Jane, I'm a different person.
- How?

617
01:20:31,492 --> 01:20:36,361
How does forgetting something like that
make you a different man?

618
01:20:36,430 --> 01:20:41,299
- Jane.
- And the sick thing is, you could.

619
01:20:42,703 --> 01:20:44,694
You could live with this.

620
01:20:44,772 --> 01:20:46,706
Janie. Jane!

621
01:20:46,774 --> 01:20:49,402
<i>You don't understand.
The woman was crazy.</i>

622
01:20:49,476 --> 01:20:51,239
Let's just take a deep breath here.

623
01:20:51,312 --> 01:20:54,213
Let's just take a moment. Wait.

624
01:20:54,281 --> 01:20:57,773
- I said wait, goddamn it!
- Wait for what?

625
01:20:57,852 --> 01:21:00,753
What can you say
that will change anything?

626
01:21:02,189 --> 01:21:04,384
I gotta go. I need-

627
01:21:04,458 --> 01:21:06,449
I need time to think.

628
01:21:07,962 --> 01:21:10,089
<i>No, I don't.</i>

629
01:21:13,267 --> 01:21:16,100
I won't spend my life with you.

630
01:21:16,170 --> 01:21:18,104
Jane. Jane, don't leave me.

631
01:21:18,706 --> 01:21:21,402
Don't leave me!

632
01:21:21,475 --> 01:21:24,239
<i>Jane! Don't leave me with her!</i>

633
01:21:27,481 --> 01:21:29,676
This is what you wanted, right?

634
01:21:33,087 --> 01:21:34,748
You and me.

635
01:21:37,758 --> 01:21:39,589
Together forever.

636
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,865
Where are you?

637
01:21:49,036 --> 01:21:51,027
Where are you?

638
01:21:52,072 --> 01:21:54,632
She's gone.

639
01:21:54,708 --> 01:21:57,472
This is what you wanted, isn't it?
Isn't it?

640
01:22:17,097 --> 01:22:18,655
<i>Honey, you gotta get that looked at.</i>

641
01:22:18,732 --> 01:22:21,360
<i>I think I tweaked
something back there.</i>

642
01:22:21,435 --> 01:22:24,461
<i>- Look at you. You look like an old man.
- I know, I know.</i>

643
01:22:29,143 --> 01:22:32,078
<i>She's been with us all along.</i>

644
01:22:42,823 --> 01:22:46,418
Get off! Get off of me!

645
01:23:48,155 --> 01:23:50,623
You'll never win.

646
01:24:08,409 --> 01:24:10,400
Fuck.

647
01:26:50,604 --> 01:26:54,267
