1
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,703
Where do I begin?

2
00:03:06,998 --> 00:03:11,374
I guess with the idea that sometimes
things happen that we don't understand.

3
00:03:12,183 --> 00:03:14,638
Maybe we shouldn't try to.

4
00:03:16,119 --> 00:03:20,593
My dad had been assigned to inspect
the military southern sector of the EPA.

5
00:03:20,663 --> 00:03:25,301
My stepmother, my half-brother and I
spent two months on the road with him.

6
00:03:25,528 --> 00:03:30,133
It's hard being in a car with a 6-year-old
and the woman who replaced your mom.

7
00:03:31,897 --> 00:03:34,548
But nobody asked me what I wanted
to do that summer.

8
00:03:35,834 --> 00:03:38,223
I guess things do happen for a reason...

9
00:03:38,714 --> 00:03:41,202
...even if you don't like what that reason is.

10
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,212
Come on.

11
00:04:13,151 --> 00:04:14,428
Fill it up.

12
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:18,359
- You got a rest room?
- It ain't great, but we've got one.

13
00:04:18,431 --> 00:04:20,887
- Not the "big old fat" part.
- Which part?

14
00:04:21,056 --> 00:04:22,965
- Can I have a soda?
- No.

15
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,244
- I see you're from Washington, D.C.
- That's right.

16
00:04:25,313 --> 00:04:26,720
Long way from home.

17
00:04:47,235 --> 00:04:49,145
You're bad. You're bad.

18
00:04:51,428 --> 00:04:52,638
You're scared.

19
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:53,689
Good.

20
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,010
They're out there.

21
00:04:59,109 --> 00:05:00,451
They're everywhere!

22
00:05:00,517 --> 00:05:02,273
They get you when you sleep.

23
00:05:02,789 --> 00:05:04,961
They get you when you sleep, you hear?

24
00:05:05,318 --> 00:05:07,522
Get out, or you'll be next!

25
00:05:09,126 --> 00:05:10,687
Dad! Dad!

26
00:05:11,782 --> 00:05:13,539
There's a psycho in there!

27
00:05:13,607 --> 00:05:15,516
- In the bathroom?
- He's got a knife!

28
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:19,428
Sweetheart?

29
00:05:19,496 --> 00:05:22,431
Maybe you should let him go in first.
He's got a gun.

30
00:05:23,241 --> 00:05:25,696
Maybe you'd better come back here, honey.

31
00:05:31,274 --> 00:05:32,703
There's nothing here.

32
00:05:34,282 --> 00:05:35,940
There's no one in there.

33
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:38,595
You okay?

34
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,040
No one's there?

35
00:05:41,194 --> 00:05:42,885
Marti, are you okay?

36
00:05:44,972 --> 00:05:49,063
Are you all right? What did he want?
Maybe we should file a police report.

37
00:05:50,987 --> 00:05:53,060
"They get you when you sleep."

38
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:55,563
I remember thinking he was crazy...

39
00:05:55,629 --> 00:05:59,306
...but I also remember thinking
we spend half our lives asleep.

40
00:06:04,237 --> 00:06:05,514
'Morning, sir.

41
00:06:05,838 --> 00:06:08,140
I'm Steve Malone. I'm with the EPA.

42
00:06:08,207 --> 00:06:10,094
General Platt's expecting us.

43
00:06:10,702 --> 00:06:11,848
One moment.

44
00:06:21,136 --> 00:06:23,308
Follow the signs to Sector C.

45
00:07:01,653 --> 00:07:02,668
I got it.

46
00:07:03,765 --> 00:07:06,766
Fifty-nine. There are three doors,
so it should be...

47
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,969
Let's see. It's this...

48
00:07:10,038 --> 00:07:12,111
How'd you know that?

49
00:07:12,183 --> 00:07:15,053
He's so smart. This kid of ours is so smart.

50
00:07:15,576 --> 00:07:17,616
How'd you know it was that door?

51
00:07:17,784 --> 00:07:19,311
Tie your shoelaces.

52
00:07:20,856 --> 00:07:21,936
I'll do it.

53
00:07:22,072 --> 00:07:24,178
Are you sure this is the right door?

54
00:07:32,025 --> 00:07:33,236
This is it?

55
00:07:36,474 --> 00:07:37,685
Great.

56
00:07:40,219 --> 00:07:42,837
Andy, come on. Help me unload the car.

57
00:07:49,724 --> 00:07:53,020
Come on, I'm going to get there
before you do.

58
00:08:27,329 --> 00:08:28,923
Andy, honey, slow down.

59
00:08:28,993 --> 00:08:30,685
There are only two bedrooms.

60
00:08:30,849 --> 00:08:33,338
You've got to share with your brother then.

61
00:08:36,354 --> 00:08:38,907
Steve, can you give me a hand up here?

62
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:41,497
Don't work too hard.

63
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:07,709
If we'd known what was waiting for us,
we would've run.

64
00:09:08,838 --> 00:09:10,977
But, in the end, it had to happen.

65
00:09:12,167 --> 00:09:14,022
And so it began.

66
00:09:19,656 --> 00:09:22,111
- This is a restricted area, miss.
- What?

67
00:09:26,185 --> 00:09:28,902
You shouldn't be here
without security clearance.

68
00:09:35,498 --> 00:09:36,447
What's up?

69
00:09:37,963 --> 00:09:39,337
Get in the car.

70
00:10:02,222 --> 00:10:03,499
I'm Jenn.

71
00:10:03,662 --> 00:10:04,556
Marti.

72
00:10:04,622 --> 00:10:06,149
Thanks for picking me up.

73
00:10:06,223 --> 00:10:08,045
No problem. They're dicks.

74
00:10:08,206 --> 00:10:09,962
What was that all about?

75
00:10:10,126 --> 00:10:13,804
God knows. They always have
a bug up their ass. Ignore them.

76
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:17,258
So what heinous misfortune
brings you here?

77
00:10:17,424 --> 00:10:20,937
A month in hell with my dad and his wife.
He's with the EPA.

78
00:10:21,104 --> 00:10:23,919
EPA, cool! Hippies saving the planet.

79
00:10:25,681 --> 00:10:27,110
Look at those goons.

80
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:30,479
They actually volunteered for this crap.
Can you believe it?

81
00:10:31,442 --> 00:10:33,352
What are you doing here?

82
00:10:33,746 --> 00:10:34,793
Not much.

83
00:10:34,931 --> 00:10:36,622
My dad runs the place.

84
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:38,385
He does?

85
00:10:43,027 --> 00:10:45,002
Mom? There's somebody here.

86
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,717
Look at this shit.

87
00:11:17,783 --> 00:11:19,791
This is why my dad's an insomniac.

88
00:11:20,088 --> 00:11:22,991
He's afraid she'll burn the house down
in her sleep.

89
00:11:25,273 --> 00:11:27,728
Mom, this is Marti. Marti, my mom.

90
00:11:31,129 --> 00:11:32,788
Vodka. Want some?

91
00:11:34,555 --> 00:11:38,450
Mom's an alcoholic.
The experts say that means I'll be one too.

92
00:11:40,859 --> 00:11:42,714
Let's go. Come on.

93
00:11:42,971 --> 00:11:45,110
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Platt.

94
00:12:16,224 --> 00:12:18,941
And I don't know what's wrong
with the kids.

95
00:12:19,008 --> 00:12:22,838
They treat me like I'm some stranger
rather than their father.

96
00:12:28,162 --> 00:12:29,722
Why are you here?

97
00:12:30,113 --> 00:12:31,291
What do you want?

98
00:12:53,061 --> 00:12:55,581
You're young, but you're old.

99
00:12:56,389 --> 00:12:59,586
Steve, you're going to get a mucho kiss.

100
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,798
Time for your mucho.

101
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:11,296
Carol doesn't like mucho kisses.

102
00:13:16,808 --> 00:13:18,663
- Hi, honey.
- Did we wake you?

103
00:13:18,728 --> 00:13:20,005
- Sorry.
- What's wrong?

104
00:13:20,073 --> 00:13:21,447
I had a nightmare.

105
00:13:21,608 --> 00:13:24,544
Come here. I'll give you a kiss
and a big hug.

106
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:26,660
A bad dream can't hurt you.

107
00:13:26,729 --> 00:13:29,064
Everybody has bad dreams, honey.

108
00:13:29,354 --> 00:13:30,499
It's okay.

109
00:13:30,634 --> 00:13:33,668
It's okay. Come on,
I'll take you back to bed.

110
00:13:36,075 --> 00:13:37,700
What the hell was that?

111
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:04,901
Have you ever been in the military?

112
00:14:04,974 --> 00:14:05,957
No, General.

113
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:10,439
Then you know absolutely nothing about
biological and chemical warfare, do you?

114
00:14:20,497 --> 00:14:22,155
It seems to me...

115
00:14:22,353 --> 00:14:25,702
...that it'd be a lot more dangerous
to move this stuff around...

116
00:14:25,841 --> 00:14:28,111
...than to leave it where it is.

117
00:14:28,178 --> 00:14:31,953
If these chemicals are safely stored,
you have nothing to worry about.

118
00:14:32,498 --> 00:14:34,637
I have nothing to worry about?

119
00:14:34,834 --> 00:14:36,078
Explain that.

120
00:14:43,284 --> 00:14:44,745
Come in here, Captain.

121
00:14:48,149 --> 00:14:49,076
Yes, sir.

122
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:53,069
Escort Dr. Malone around the base.
Show him what he needs to see.

123
00:14:53,205 --> 00:14:55,540
Let him take samples and run tests.

124
00:14:55,701 --> 00:14:58,800
Then do whatever you have to
to expedite his departure.

125
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:22,098
Mr. Malone?

126
00:15:26,202 --> 00:15:27,696
Good afternoon, sir.

127
00:15:27,866 --> 00:15:29,240
- Can I help you?
- Yeah.

128
00:15:29,306 --> 00:15:32,568
Can you give us some space?
I want to talk to him.

129
00:15:37,819 --> 00:15:40,089
I'm Major Collins,
head of the base medical corps.

130
00:15:40,187 --> 00:15:41,300
Hold on.

131
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,299
I wanted to meet you...

132
00:15:46,364 --> 00:15:49,529
...and extend my cooperation
to you personally.

133
00:15:49,885 --> 00:15:51,129
Thank you.

134
00:15:53,821 --> 00:15:57,978
I'm very interested in the effects exposure
to these chemicals can have on people.

135
00:15:58,141 --> 00:15:59,319
Effects?

136
00:16:00,446 --> 00:16:04,341
You got a lot of chemicals on this base.
They're all pretty toxic.

137
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:07,293
Effects? Physically,
they could be devastating.

138
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:10,587
Not physically. I'm referring
to psychological effects.

139
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:12,345
I'm not following you.

140
00:16:12,511 --> 00:16:15,381
Can they affect brain patterns?

141
00:16:15,776 --> 00:16:18,908
Can they interfere with
chemo-neurological processes?

142
00:16:19,072 --> 00:16:21,342
Can they foster psychoses, paranoias...

143
00:16:21,696 --> 00:16:23,223
...narcophobias?

144
00:16:23,617 --> 00:16:26,334
I'm a chemist, not a psychiatrist.

145
00:16:26,497 --> 00:16:27,675
I don't know.

146
00:16:28,034 --> 00:16:29,212
Simply...

147
00:16:30,018 --> 00:16:32,506
...can they alter one's view of reality?

148
00:16:33,314 --> 00:16:34,656
Let me be frank.

149
00:16:35,555 --> 00:16:37,726
I'm seeing people at the infirmary...

150
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,581
...who are exhibiting...

151
00:16:39,715 --> 00:16:42,585
...extreme delusional fixations.

152
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:44,733
People...

153
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,325
...afraid to sleep.

154
00:16:47,876 --> 00:16:49,731
People afraid to...

155
00:16:50,917 --> 00:16:53,634
...deal with family members.
Afraid of them.

156
00:16:54,341 --> 00:16:55,551
Exhibiting...

157
00:16:56,102 --> 00:16:58,241
...paranoia about others...

158
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,547
...about other people's identities.

159
00:17:01,542 --> 00:17:03,299
People afraid of themselves.

160
00:17:06,535 --> 00:17:09,797
Suddenly, I got a camp full
of very displaced people.

161
00:17:10,856 --> 00:17:14,434
I don't know what you're seeing,
but it's not the PCBs.

162
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:17,469
That phenomenon is not
part of the symptomology.

163
00:17:19,881 --> 00:17:22,369
Keep me up to date on your research.

164
00:17:24,105 --> 00:17:26,112
I'm worried about these... people.

165
00:17:32,523 --> 00:17:34,279
Better take a vacation, Doc.

166
00:17:45,004 --> 00:17:47,241
We have equipment for Dr. Malone.

167
00:17:49,645 --> 00:17:50,757
Come in.

168
00:18:42,835 --> 00:18:44,429
What are you doing in there?

169
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,093
Delivering the boxes.

170
00:18:46,388 --> 00:18:47,730
Are you through?

171
00:18:56,054 --> 00:18:57,232
Good.

172
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:01,324
Very good.

173
00:19:05,014 --> 00:19:06,160
Good work.

174
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:09,745
Very good work.

175
00:19:17,881 --> 00:19:19,255
Very good.

176
00:19:22,042 --> 00:19:23,798
Okay, all done?

177
00:19:25,945 --> 00:19:28,663
Everyone hold your picture up.

178
00:19:31,258 --> 00:19:32,403
Very good.

179
00:19:35,355 --> 00:19:36,599
Good.

180
00:19:37,275 --> 00:19:38,584
Very good.

181
00:20:38,659 --> 00:20:40,831
"When it's over, let's do it again."

182
00:20:45,476 --> 00:20:46,970
Hey, little man!

183
00:20:48,741 --> 00:20:50,268
Hey, little man!

184
00:20:57,062 --> 00:20:59,134
- What are you doing?
- Running away.

185
00:20:59,302 --> 00:21:00,829
What are you running from?

186
00:21:00,902 --> 00:21:02,277
The bad people.

187
00:21:02,918 --> 00:21:04,413
The bad people?

188
00:21:05,223 --> 00:21:06,882
Come, we'll take you home.

189
00:21:10,984 --> 00:21:12,894
- Your folks in the military?
- No.

190
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,717
Sector C, Petey.

191
00:21:48,844 --> 00:21:50,252
There's my bike!

192
00:21:50,317 --> 00:21:52,739
That's your bike? Okay, pull it over.

193
00:22:07,728 --> 00:22:09,321
Sure this is the house?

194
00:22:13,488 --> 00:22:14,918
What's going on?

195
00:22:15,728 --> 00:22:17,157
Found him wandering around.

196
00:22:17,233 --> 00:22:18,760
We figured he was lost.

197
00:22:21,553 --> 00:22:23,211
You should be in day care.

198
00:22:23,313 --> 00:22:24,906
I hate that place.

199
00:22:25,329 --> 00:22:26,312
What happened?

200
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:28,296
They all had the same pictures.

201
00:22:29,234 --> 00:22:31,722
They tried to make me go to sleep.

202
00:22:32,114 --> 00:22:34,504
Tried to make me go to sleep.

203
00:22:36,851 --> 00:22:38,891
Sorry to have troubled you.

204
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:40,363
No trouble.

205
00:22:40,435 --> 00:22:42,028
What're you doing home?

206
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,173
Are you an MP, or something?

207
00:22:44,852 --> 00:22:46,925
No, I'm a chopper pilot.

208
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:50,026
Thanks for bringing him home.

209
00:22:51,573 --> 00:22:53,232
Maybe I'll see you around.

210
00:22:54,358 --> 00:22:55,154
Where?

211
00:22:58,934 --> 00:23:01,968
Top Gun? It's on Route 8.
It's the only club around.

212
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,268
Name's Tim.

213
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:07,316
Marti.

214
00:23:11,416 --> 00:23:13,009
- No problem at all.
- Thanks.

215
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,192
Take care.

216
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,495
- Thank you.
- No problem.

217
00:23:17,561 --> 00:23:18,771
Appreciate it.

218
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,531
Thanks very much.

219
00:23:20,921 --> 00:23:22,448
All right. Take care.

220
00:23:22,522 --> 00:23:24,595
- Say, "Thank you."
- Thank you.

221
00:23:29,082 --> 00:23:32,760
What's this about, "The kids don't
like me?" How could they not?

222
00:23:32,923 --> 00:23:35,640
He's the new kid.
It's his first day at school.

223
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:39,027
The faster he goes back,
the faster he'll make friends.

224
00:23:50,525 --> 00:23:51,801
- Hi.
- Hey, chick.

225
00:23:52,061 --> 00:23:53,884
Get your coat. Let's go.

226
00:23:54,877 --> 00:23:55,990
Where are we going?

227
00:23:56,062 --> 00:23:58,615
Out. Anywhere. Anywhere but here.

228
00:24:00,446 --> 00:24:02,519
Jenn Platt, Carol.

229
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:07,478
I'm sorry, I didn't realize you knew...
Steve!

230
00:24:07,648 --> 00:24:09,753
Marti has a friend here. Want anything?

231
00:24:09,824 --> 00:24:11,864
- We don't have much.
- I'm fine.

232
00:24:11,936 --> 00:24:13,660
We have milk, orange juice...

233
00:24:13,921 --> 00:24:15,514
I could make lemonade. Or tea.

234
00:24:15,585 --> 00:24:16,763
We have mint.

235
00:24:16,864 --> 00:24:19,199
- Jenn Platt. Nice to meet you.
- Steve Malone.

236
00:24:19,265 --> 00:24:20,214
Popcorn?

237
00:24:20,769 --> 00:24:22,777
- I'm fine.
- Did you say "Platt"?

238
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:24,541
Yes, the general's daughter.

239
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:27,741
I came by to take Marti
and show her around.

240
00:24:29,027 --> 00:24:29,975
Where?

241
00:24:30,787 --> 00:24:33,089
The base. The rec center.

242
00:24:34,051 --> 00:24:36,124
When are you planning to be home?

243
00:24:36,771 --> 00:24:37,819
12:00?

244
00:24:43,332 --> 00:24:44,379
Done! Let's go.

245
00:24:44,772 --> 00:24:48,668
But do be home by 12:00. That's all I ask.
Just be home by 12:00.

246
00:24:48,805 --> 00:24:49,820
Nice meeting you.

247
00:24:49,894 --> 00:24:52,545
That's a really interesting outfit
you've got on.

248
00:24:56,518 --> 00:24:58,275
- Here?
- This is it.

249
00:24:59,495 --> 00:25:01,186
I don't have any ID.

250
00:25:01,734 --> 00:25:04,550
Don't get your panties in a bunch.
Just come.

251
00:25:17,097 --> 00:25:19,486
Oh, man, where is everybody?

252
00:25:21,033 --> 00:25:22,691
Hey, ladies.

253
00:25:22,953 --> 00:25:24,546
You want to dance?

254
00:25:24,778 --> 00:25:25,988
Lambada?

255
00:25:30,794 --> 00:25:32,289
Look who's here.

256
00:25:32,459 --> 00:25:34,368
I don't believe my eyes. Jenn.

257
00:25:34,443 --> 00:25:37,258
Where is everybody?
Word get out that you'd be here?

258
00:25:37,419 --> 00:25:39,362
They heard your old man was coming.

259
00:25:39,436 --> 00:25:41,508
Yeah, to court-martial your ass.

260
00:25:41,676 --> 00:25:44,066
- This is Pete and...
- Marti.

261
00:25:44,621 --> 00:25:46,050
You know each other?

262
00:25:46,381 --> 00:25:47,755
We met earlier.

263
00:25:47,981 --> 00:25:50,315
When? You just got here yesterday.

264
00:25:52,302 --> 00:25:53,993
What do I do to get a drink here?

265
00:25:54,062 --> 00:25:55,972
You want a drink? Have a drink.

266
00:25:56,142 --> 00:25:57,190
Come here.

267
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:00,075
You can have anything.

268
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:01,353
You know that.

269
00:26:05,263 --> 00:26:06,572
This is romantic.

270
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,748
Now what?

271
00:26:07,823 --> 00:26:09,995
Let me dazzle you with my stick work.

272
00:26:10,064 --> 00:26:11,274
Or not.

273
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,263
I mean, let's play some pool.

274
00:26:13,904 --> 00:26:15,311
All right, let's go.

275
00:26:22,802 --> 00:26:23,750
Sit down.

276
00:26:27,282 --> 00:26:28,395
How are you?

277
00:26:29,043 --> 00:26:30,058
Good.

278
00:26:30,451 --> 00:26:31,760
How's your brother?

279
00:26:32,979 --> 00:26:34,736
He's kind of weirded out.

280
00:26:36,564 --> 00:26:38,058
Can I get you a drink?

281
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,635
Yeah. I'll have whatever he's having.

282
00:26:43,668 --> 00:26:45,097
Yeah, right.

283
00:26:45,172 --> 00:26:47,987
Hey, Melissa,
can I get a couple of beers, please?

284
00:26:48,629 --> 00:26:50,058
Andy's a nice kid.

285
00:26:51,766 --> 00:26:53,042
Do you want him?

286
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:54,867
Do I want him?

287
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,076
Shit!

288
00:27:09,528 --> 00:27:10,705
What's wrong?

289
00:27:10,872 --> 00:27:12,399
- I know that guy.
- What guy?

290
00:27:12,472 --> 00:27:13,421
He scared me.

291
00:27:16,153 --> 00:27:17,680
What'd you do to her?

292
00:27:19,481 --> 00:27:20,975
What are you talking about?

293
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:24,144
In the gas station.

294
00:27:26,651 --> 00:27:28,953
Your girlfriend's had too much to drink.

295
00:27:29,275 --> 00:27:31,031
You should take her home.

296
00:27:34,172 --> 00:27:35,284
Oh, Tim.

297
00:27:35,611 --> 00:27:36,888
It's okay.

298
00:27:40,732 --> 00:27:42,488
Guess I made a mistake.

299
00:27:50,813 --> 00:27:53,366
I was 7 when she died.

300
00:27:54,878 --> 00:27:57,431
I didn't expect my dad to marry again.

301
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:00,246
Stupid, huh?

302
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:04,730
You must really miss her.

303
00:28:05,375 --> 00:28:07,034
What was your mother like?

304
00:28:08,352 --> 00:28:11,069
You always remember the good things
about people.

305
00:28:17,761 --> 00:28:19,038
I miss her.

306
00:28:26,242 --> 00:28:28,064
Did you ever play, "I Never"?

307
00:28:28,258 --> 00:28:29,306
What's that?

308
00:28:29,378 --> 00:28:31,004
You put your hands up...

309
00:28:31,203 --> 00:28:35,426
...and the object is to make the other guy
drop all his fingers down.

310
00:28:36,099 --> 00:28:38,336
So, if I were to say...

311
00:28:39,044 --> 00:28:40,954
..."I've never been to Mars"...

312
00:28:41,029 --> 00:28:44,509
...then neither of us put our fingers down,
'cause we haven't been there.

313
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:47,745
But if you said, "I never wore a dress"...

314
00:28:48,485 --> 00:28:51,202
...then I'd have to put a finger down.
Get it?

315
00:28:51,942 --> 00:28:53,764
- Okay, go ahead.
- You start.

316
00:28:55,558 --> 00:28:57,860
I've never eaten Brussels sprouts.

317
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,138
I've never been in a helicopter.

318
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:15,008
I've never tried to give
my kid brother away.

319
00:29:18,569 --> 00:29:20,195
I've never shot anyone.

320
00:29:30,955 --> 00:29:31,784
When?

321
00:29:32,907 --> 00:29:33,922
Kuwait.

322
00:29:51,982 --> 00:29:53,892
I never hide my feelings.

323
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:39,449
- What's the matter?
- It's Mommy!

324
00:32:39,556 --> 00:32:42,306
- What about Mommy?
- Her head came off. She's dead!

325
00:32:42,373 --> 00:32:45,407
- There's Mommy, right there.
- She's not my mommy!

326
00:32:45,573 --> 00:32:47,810
- What happened?
- He had a bad dream.

327
00:32:49,094 --> 00:32:51,396
It's okay. I'll put you to bed.

328
00:32:51,558 --> 00:32:53,566
No! That isn't my mommy!

329
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,487
Wait!

330
00:33:03,719 --> 00:33:04,668
Wait!

331
00:33:11,721 --> 00:33:13,379
Take your brother inside.

332
00:33:13,577 --> 00:33:15,399
Take him inside. Do it.

333
00:33:19,081 --> 00:33:21,253
- Are you aware she's underage?
- No, sir.

334
00:33:21,322 --> 00:33:24,137
You aware you're giving booze
to an underage girl?

335
00:33:24,394 --> 00:33:25,823
You weren't aware of that?

336
00:33:25,898 --> 00:33:27,491
- No, sir.
- No?

337
00:33:28,395 --> 00:33:29,922
- That's funny?
- No, sir.

338
00:33:30,027 --> 00:33:31,850
Don't come here anymore.

339
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:35,808
Come on.

340
00:33:42,124 --> 00:33:43,750
I'm not lying, Marti!

341
00:33:43,981 --> 00:33:45,738
Nobody said you were.

342
00:33:45,998 --> 00:33:48,332
I had nightmares when I was your age.

343
00:33:48,397 --> 00:33:49,991
They go away all by themselves.

344
00:33:50,286 --> 00:33:51,977
She's not Mommy, Marti.

345
00:33:52,686 --> 00:33:55,621
She is your mommy. She loves you a lot.

346
00:33:56,174 --> 00:33:57,636
My mommy died.

347
00:34:00,367 --> 00:34:03,237
- I don't want to talk. I'm angry.
- Dad, please.

348
00:34:03,407 --> 00:34:06,125
I can't trust you.
You're drunk and an hour late.

349
00:34:06,288 --> 00:34:07,881
I'm not drunk.

350
00:34:07,952 --> 00:34:09,578
And you've known him 100 years...

351
00:34:09,649 --> 00:34:13,097
I had one lousy beer and came home
half an hour late!

352
00:34:13,425 --> 00:34:15,814
Big deal! I'm not a fucking 10-year-old!

353
00:34:15,922 --> 00:34:18,704
Don't use that language.
You don't talk that way to me.

354
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:21,258
Why? It's the only time you'll listen.

355
00:34:21,554 --> 00:34:23,856
- That's not true.
- Bullshit!

356
00:34:24,147 --> 00:34:26,383
You never listen to me. Why do I bother?

357
00:34:26,451 --> 00:34:27,312
Wait.

358
00:34:27,411 --> 00:34:29,320
Wait! Wait!

359
00:35:38,652 --> 00:35:41,041
Would you stop kicking the table, please?

360
00:35:44,958 --> 00:35:45,973
Thank you.

361
00:36:05,377 --> 00:36:07,351
I can't wait until I'm 18.

362
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,982
Why? Think you won't be my daughter?

363
00:36:11,105 --> 00:36:12,796
I'll still be your daughter.

364
00:36:13,058 --> 00:36:15,130
I just won't have to listen to you.

365
00:36:15,393 --> 00:36:17,117
You don't listen to me now.

366
00:36:19,298 --> 00:36:23,008
If you want to go so bad,
you don't have to wait until you're 18.

367
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:25,857
Just go now.

368
00:36:29,283 --> 00:36:30,876
You'd like that.

369
00:36:32,067 --> 00:36:33,977
Then it'd just be you three.

370
00:36:49,446 --> 00:36:52,861
Want to go back to day care,
or stay home with Mommy?

371
00:36:57,319 --> 00:36:58,781
My mommy's dead.

372
00:37:39,917 --> 00:37:41,194
Okay. Come down.

373
00:37:50,542 --> 00:37:53,226
Be very careful with that stuff.
It's very toxic.

374
00:37:54,126 --> 00:37:55,075
Watch out!

375
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:12,394
Get an ambulance and a clean-up crew.

376
00:38:13,841 --> 00:38:15,751
Get back. We'll take care of him.

377
00:38:15,826 --> 00:38:18,859
What the hell's the matter with you?
Get an ambulance!

378
00:38:20,786 --> 00:38:22,380
Jesus, what is that?

379
00:38:23,123 --> 00:38:24,017
Nothing.

380
00:38:24,083 --> 00:38:25,196
Shit!

381
00:38:56,599 --> 00:38:57,941
Is Jenn here?

382
00:38:58,552 --> 00:38:59,828
Come on up.

383
00:39:13,754 --> 00:39:14,866
Try this.

384
00:39:16,762 --> 00:39:17,809
Taste it.

385
00:39:20,027 --> 00:39:21,783
- It's water.
- That's right.

386
00:39:21,979 --> 00:39:24,150
There's always vodka in this glass.

387
00:39:24,955 --> 00:39:27,126
Maybe she went on the wagon.

388
00:39:27,675 --> 00:39:30,610
If she were on the wagon,
she'd be climbing the walls.

389
00:39:32,124 --> 00:39:33,466
I'm leaving now.

390
00:39:33,756 --> 00:39:35,131
Where are you going?

391
00:39:35,741 --> 00:39:38,229
We're playing bridge at the Smythe's.

392
00:39:43,389 --> 00:39:44,404
What?

393
00:39:44,701 --> 00:39:46,524
She doesn't know how to play bridge.

394
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:01,949
Sir, there's been an accident
in the storage warehouse.

395
00:40:02,112 --> 00:40:04,982
Initial reports indicate camp personnel
have been injured.

396
00:40:05,216 --> 00:40:08,729
We're preparing a written summary.
I'll have it for you in an hour.

397
00:40:09,057 --> 00:40:10,584
Thank you, Captain.

398
00:40:49,319 --> 00:40:51,010
I took it off the suit fibers.

399
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:55,073
I ran the entire herbicide screen.
I still don't know what it is.

400
00:40:55,239 --> 00:40:59,298
I'll send you the sample tomorrow.
Give it the full GCMS.

401
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:04,350
I'm telling you, I've never seen anything
like this in my life.

402
00:41:04,456 --> 00:41:05,252
Ever.

403
00:41:05,448 --> 00:41:09,191
It scares me. It's not blood.
I don't know what the hell it is.

404
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:11,077
Run a protocol...

405
00:41:11,146 --> 00:41:13,055
...and get back to me quickly.

406
00:41:38,765 --> 00:41:40,521
I want to go home.

407
00:41:41,325 --> 00:41:44,904
Dad promised as soon as he's done
with his tests, we'll leave.

408
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:49,543
It's going to be okay.

409
00:41:51,086 --> 00:41:53,388
It happens when you sleep.

410
00:41:56,751 --> 00:41:57,799
What does?

411
00:41:57,967 --> 00:41:59,244
You die.

412
00:42:00,208 --> 00:42:01,485
Tub's full.

413
00:42:05,873 --> 00:42:07,946
Hurry, it's going to overflow.

414
00:42:25,811 --> 00:42:27,240
Get in bed.

415
00:42:31,252 --> 00:42:33,488
I said, get in bed.

416
00:42:40,373 --> 00:42:41,551
Night-night.

417
00:43:49,663 --> 00:43:51,256
Is your back sore?

418
00:43:52,543 --> 00:43:54,366
Want me to give you a massage?

419
00:43:54,687 --> 00:43:56,094
Yeah, lie down.

420
00:44:01,024 --> 00:44:02,366
Lie down.

421
00:44:07,745 --> 00:44:09,655
Marti's really mad at me.

422
00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:12,057
She'll get over it.

423
00:44:12,225 --> 00:44:13,371
You'll see.

424
00:44:13,826 --> 00:44:15,485
Wake up in the morning...

425
00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:17,239
...be another day.

426
00:44:17,890 --> 00:44:19,800
Be like none of it happened.

427
00:44:20,291 --> 00:44:21,818
She'll be okay.

428
00:44:23,651 --> 00:44:25,080
It'll be over.

429
00:44:27,491 --> 00:44:28,921
I love you.

430
00:44:29,892 --> 00:44:31,747
I love you too.

431
00:44:33,029 --> 00:44:34,305
Just let go.

432
00:47:43,134 --> 00:47:45,207
Daddy! No! Wake up!

433
00:48:12,578 --> 00:48:14,269
Wake up! Wake up!

434
00:48:16,002 --> 00:48:18,108
Wake him up! Get him dressed!

435
00:48:19,203 --> 00:48:21,145
759, Sector C.

436
00:48:22,979 --> 00:48:25,151
We got to go! We got to go right now!

437
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:28,090
- Listen to me.
- You don't understand! We got to go!

438
00:48:28,836 --> 00:48:30,691
Go where?

439
00:48:30,789 --> 00:48:32,698
Go! What're you talking about?

440
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:34,843
Steve, this is important.

441
00:48:35,525 --> 00:48:37,314
Go where?

442
00:48:40,422 --> 00:48:43,040
That's right. Go where?

443
00:48:43,686 --> 00:48:45,442
Are you listening?

444
00:48:46,087 --> 00:48:49,284
What happened in your room
is not an isolated incident.

445
00:48:49,542 --> 00:48:51,812
It is happening everywhere.

446
00:48:51,879 --> 00:48:53,537
- What?
- Where would we run?

447
00:48:54,568 --> 00:48:56,226
Where are you going to go?

448
00:48:56,488 --> 00:48:58,146
Where are you going to run?

449
00:48:58,504 --> 00:49:00,228
Where are you going to hide?

450
00:49:00,584 --> 00:49:01,861
Nowhere.

451
00:49:01,928 --> 00:49:04,863
Because there's no one like you left.

452
00:49:06,537 --> 00:49:07,486
That's right.

453
00:49:09,386 --> 00:49:10,564
Oh, God.

454
00:49:11,306 --> 00:49:14,241
That's right. That's good.
You're listening now.

455
00:49:15,466 --> 00:49:17,703
Now I know you're frightened, Steve.

456
00:49:18,346 --> 00:49:20,583
I know you're scared. That's okay.

457
00:49:20,811 --> 00:49:23,016
I understand that you're confused.

458
00:49:23,084 --> 00:49:25,473
Let me tell you something, Steve.

459
00:49:25,612 --> 00:49:28,744
All that anger, all that fear and confusion...

460
00:49:29,068 --> 00:49:31,785
...it's going to melt away.
It's going to go away.

461
00:49:32,173 --> 00:49:35,686
It's going to go away. Go to sleep.
Wake up. It's very simple.

462
00:49:35,821 --> 00:49:38,342
In the morning, you'll feel wonderful.

463
00:49:38,669 --> 00:49:42,085
- We'll be together. We're connected.
- What's happening?

464
00:49:42,190 --> 00:49:43,336
We're together.

465
00:49:43,407 --> 00:49:45,382
Your fear. That's good. Let it go.

466
00:49:48,687 --> 00:49:51,076
Get away from me!
Get away from my kids!

467
00:50:33,236 --> 00:50:34,666
This way!

468
00:50:35,797 --> 00:50:37,554
Go on, we'll cover you!

469
00:50:37,622 --> 00:50:39,215
Move it out, mister!

470
00:50:45,943 --> 00:50:47,470
What's all that noise?

471
00:50:52,599 --> 00:50:54,487
Petey, those are gunshots.

472
00:51:04,441 --> 00:51:06,514
Pete, where the fuck are you?

473
00:51:15,386 --> 00:51:16,913
What's going on?

474
00:51:19,643 --> 00:51:21,137
Sit down, Timbo.

475
00:51:22,267 --> 00:51:24,090
What the hell's going on?

476
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:27,125
Hey, Justin.

477
00:51:28,124 --> 00:51:29,651
Go to sleep, Timbo.

478
00:51:30,204 --> 00:51:31,830
What is this, a joke?

479
00:51:32,669 --> 00:51:34,130
Just go back to bed.

480
00:51:34,685 --> 00:51:36,245
What's with the needle?

481
00:51:37,150 --> 00:51:38,426
What is this?

482
00:51:39,710 --> 00:51:41,052
What're you doing?

483
00:51:44,479 --> 00:51:46,519
I told you to go to bed, didn't I?

484
00:52:25,156 --> 00:52:26,749
Take my watch.

485
00:52:28,133 --> 00:52:30,271
I gotta try to find us some help.

486
00:52:31,013 --> 00:52:32,835
Be back in a couple of hours.

487
00:52:35,814 --> 00:52:37,243
You'll be okay.

488
00:52:37,894 --> 00:52:39,323
You'll be okay.

489
00:52:39,494 --> 00:52:41,349
Do what your sister tells you.

490
00:52:41,414 --> 00:52:42,909
Where are you going?

491
00:52:43,078 --> 00:52:45,315
To find us a way out of here.

492
00:52:46,535 --> 00:52:48,445
Just be very quiet, okay?

493
00:52:56,456 --> 00:52:58,114
Don't worry, sweetheart.

494
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:00,677
I won't let anything happen to you.

495
00:54:04,465 --> 00:54:06,123
I need an outside line.

496
00:54:07,666 --> 00:54:11,015
Sorry, Major Collins,
all the lines are busy at present.

497
00:54:11,186 --> 00:54:14,601
Stay where you are.
I'll keep trying and call you back.

498
00:54:14,930 --> 00:54:16,840
How do you know my name?

499
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:19,726
I didn't tell you my name!

500
00:54:19,891 --> 00:54:22,161
How the hell do you know my name?

501
00:54:35,893 --> 00:54:36,940
Major.

502
00:54:41,974 --> 00:54:42,835
Back!

503
00:54:43,734 --> 00:54:45,327
It's me. It's Steve Malone.

504
00:54:45,398 --> 00:54:46,675
Remember me?

505
00:54:48,151 --> 00:54:49,974
I know who you are. You...

506
00:54:50,071 --> 00:54:51,981
...stay... back.

507
00:54:52,471 --> 00:54:53,966
You gotta help me.

508
00:54:54,392 --> 00:54:56,247
No time left. My kids are in danger.

509
00:54:56,312 --> 00:54:57,588
My wife is...

510
00:54:58,392 --> 00:54:59,985
Do you have a car?

511
00:55:05,657 --> 00:55:06,934
Please. Come on.

512
00:55:07,002 --> 00:55:08,911
It's too late to run.

513
00:55:09,178 --> 00:55:10,422
It's too late!

514
00:55:11,707 --> 00:55:13,267
They've taken the base!

515
00:55:13,979 --> 00:55:17,908
All we can do is wait
until they come and then...

516
00:55:18,139 --> 00:55:19,349
The keys.

517
00:55:19,996 --> 00:55:21,272
The keys.

518
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:23,253
They'll follow you.

519
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:27,634
They'll follow you.

520
00:55:29,629 --> 00:55:30,806
That's how they work.

521
00:55:31,421 --> 00:55:34,040
We gotta stand up and fight back now!

522
00:55:36,637 --> 00:55:38,132
I've got a gun for you.

523
00:55:38,782 --> 00:55:40,473
I've got a gun for you too.

524
00:55:41,246 --> 00:55:42,675
We'll give them hell!

525
00:55:42,943 --> 00:55:44,569
We'll give them hell.

526
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:48,316
We'll show them what the human race
is really made of.

527
00:55:53,728 --> 00:55:54,676
Want some?

528
00:55:54,752 --> 00:55:56,924
Stay with me, Doctor. We have to go.

529
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:58,261
Now.

530
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:04,475
You can't sleep. You gotta make sure
you don't sleep.

531
00:56:17,475 --> 00:56:18,423
Come on.

532
00:56:20,324 --> 00:56:21,404
Please.

533
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:23,489
Please.

534
00:56:28,325 --> 00:56:29,852
The head cabbage.

535
00:56:31,525 --> 00:56:33,500
Well, well, well, well, well.

536
00:56:35,046 --> 00:56:36,704
Be realistic, Major.

537
00:56:38,086 --> 00:56:39,362
Put it down.

538
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:43,364
Not before I unload a few
into you onion-heads.

539
00:56:43,527 --> 00:56:45,415
Relax, Major. Take it easy.

540
00:56:46,023 --> 00:56:47,616
You disappoint me.

541
00:56:48,647 --> 00:56:50,786
You're a man of medicine.

542
00:56:50,952 --> 00:56:54,084
You're supposed to preserve life,
not take it.

543
00:56:54,248 --> 00:56:55,590
You bastard!

544
00:56:56,713 --> 00:56:58,535
You call what you are "life"?

545
00:56:59,753 --> 00:57:01,182
I know who you are!

546
00:57:01,449 --> 00:57:03,359
- I know who you are!
- Do you?

547
00:57:06,954 --> 00:57:08,383
Amphetamines.

548
00:57:08,490 --> 00:57:12,004
I know what happens when you bastards
catch somebody sleeping.

549
00:57:12,394 --> 00:57:13,507
Want a few?

550
00:57:14,955 --> 00:57:17,060
Look what your fear has done to you.

551
00:57:18,092 --> 00:57:19,499
Can't you see?

552
00:57:19,916 --> 00:57:22,251
When all things are conformed...

553
00:57:22,572 --> 00:57:25,507
...there'll be no more disputes.
No conflicts.

554
00:57:25,996 --> 00:57:27,425
No more problems.

555
00:57:27,693 --> 00:57:30,727
Abandon yourself and join us.
There are hundreds...

556
00:57:30,893 --> 00:57:33,032
...even thousands of us here.

557
00:57:33,198 --> 00:57:35,980
We've traveled light years
throughout the universe...

558
00:57:36,078 --> 00:57:38,631
...always surviving, growing stronger.

559
00:57:38,798 --> 00:57:40,708
Because we've learned...

560
00:57:41,135 --> 00:57:43,371
...it's the race that's important...

561
00:57:43,855 --> 00:57:45,262
...not the individual.

562
00:57:46,415 --> 00:57:48,717
The individual's always important.

563
00:57:48,976 --> 00:57:52,293
- Only unity guarantees survival.
- So you must join us.

564
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:55,434
- The human race is doomed.
- Accept it.

565
00:57:55,664 --> 00:57:56,941
It's a better way.

566
00:57:57,009 --> 00:57:59,497
- Stay back!
- It's a matter of survival.

567
00:57:59,697 --> 00:58:03,046
Stay back! Stay back!
I'm warning you to stay back!

568
00:58:03,441 --> 00:58:04,489
Doctor...

569
00:58:05,457 --> 00:58:07,280
...put the gun down.

570
00:58:10,162 --> 00:58:12,017
You'll never get my soul.

571
00:58:14,003 --> 00:58:14,896
Never.

572
00:58:23,924 --> 00:58:26,477
"Nobody likes us

573
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:29,294
"Everybody hates us

574
00:58:29,845 --> 00:58:32,398
"Going to the garden...

575
00:58:32,565 --> 00:58:34,475
"...to get worms

576
00:58:36,278 --> 00:58:40,108
"Long, thin, slimy ones

577
00:58:40,278 --> 00:58:42,831
"...short, fat, juicy ones...

578
00:58:44,503 --> 00:58:48,366
"...itsy-bitsy, fuzzy worms

579
00:58:51,704 --> 00:58:54,159
"First, you bite the head off

580
00:58:55,065 --> 00:58:57,618
"Then you suck the juice out

581
00:58:58,489 --> 00:59:01,359
"Then you throw the rest away"

582
00:59:13,211 --> 00:59:14,488
Everybody okay?

583
00:59:14,875 --> 00:59:16,948
I found us a way out of here.

584
00:59:58,401 --> 01:00:00,288
Dad, they're everywhere!

585
01:00:09,026 --> 01:00:10,455
Where are we going?

586
01:00:11,523 --> 01:00:13,760
I know what I'm doing. Don't worry.

587
01:00:16,932 --> 01:00:18,939
Just don't show any emotion.

588
01:00:19,171 --> 01:00:20,765
They can be fooled.

589
01:00:42,566 --> 01:00:44,127
I know where I'm going.

590
01:00:45,927 --> 01:00:47,968
I know exactly what I'm doing.

591
01:00:57,737 --> 01:00:59,111
Where are you going?

592
01:01:03,145 --> 01:01:03,974
Stop!

593
01:01:04,170 --> 01:01:06,025
Let go! Let go!

594
01:01:07,019 --> 01:01:08,448
Shit! Shit!

595
01:01:08,650 --> 01:01:11,301
Don't make me hurt you. Just calm down.

596
01:01:13,195 --> 01:01:14,143
What's going on?

597
01:01:14,219 --> 01:01:15,364
Let her go!

598
01:01:16,235 --> 01:01:17,283
Leave her alone!

599
01:01:17,964 --> 01:01:19,371
Shoot him! Shoot him!

600
01:01:19,436 --> 01:01:21,705
- What's happening?
- He's not my father!

601
01:01:22,092 --> 01:01:23,237
It's not him!

602
01:01:23,372 --> 01:01:24,485
Shoot him!

603
01:01:24,556 --> 01:01:28,069
- Just back up. Back up. Put it away.
- Don't listen!

604
01:01:28,557 --> 01:01:30,859
- Shoot him!
- What do you mean?

605
01:01:30,925 --> 01:01:31,852
Stay back.

606
01:01:31,918 --> 01:01:34,471
It's not my dad! He killed my father.

607
01:01:35,117 --> 01:01:37,092
- Put it away.
- It's not my dad!

608
01:01:37,358 --> 01:01:39,595
- They killed my father!
- Just relax...

609
01:01:39,663 --> 01:01:41,573
- Shoot him!
...and put it away.

610
01:01:42,639 --> 01:01:44,068
What are you doing?

611
01:02:16,627 --> 01:02:18,154
Marti, let's go.

612
01:02:26,709 --> 01:02:27,986
Come on, Marti!

613
01:03:14,908 --> 01:03:15,988
There's my chopper.

614
01:03:16,347 --> 01:03:18,486
It's too dangerous, so I'm going alone.

615
01:03:18,652 --> 01:03:20,660
Watch for me. I'll land it over here.

616
01:03:20,732 --> 01:03:23,034
Be ready to make your move
when I touch down.

617
01:03:27,229 --> 01:03:29,052
We'll get out of here.

618
01:03:31,134 --> 01:03:33,305
Ready for that ride I promised you?

619
01:03:35,070 --> 01:03:36,150
All right.

620
01:03:38,174 --> 01:03:39,997
Just act like one of them.

621
01:03:41,535 --> 01:03:43,194
Be careful.

622
01:04:18,820 --> 01:04:20,708
Nobody believed me.

623
01:04:46,376 --> 01:04:48,384
I figured you'd try a bird.

624
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:51,709
What do you mean?

625
01:04:53,289 --> 01:04:55,144
You know what I mean.

626
01:04:56,745 --> 01:04:58,720
Now we're all the same, Petey.

627
01:05:00,585 --> 01:05:02,408
So what are you running from?

628
01:05:02,986 --> 01:05:04,328
Who's running?

629
01:05:04,810 --> 01:05:06,152
I've got orders.

630
01:05:17,067 --> 01:05:19,140
We're all one happy family now.

631
01:05:22,284 --> 01:05:23,212
Happy?

632
01:05:25,741 --> 01:05:26,952
What's that?

633
01:05:29,901 --> 01:05:32,171
You're wasting my time, Lieutenant.

634
01:05:32,525 --> 01:05:34,697
They're waiting for light support.

635
01:05:37,070 --> 01:05:38,445
Hey, Timbo...

636
01:05:38,959 --> 01:05:40,486
...just so you know...

637
01:05:42,831 --> 01:05:44,740
...I fucked your girlfriend.

638
01:05:54,352 --> 01:05:56,076
Okay, let him at the bird.

639
01:06:34,582 --> 01:06:36,851
- What are you doing?
- No! Don't!

640
01:06:40,119 --> 01:06:41,942
You're making a mistake!

641
01:10:47,033 --> 01:10:47,981
Don't!

642
01:10:53,017 --> 01:10:53,965
Please.

643
01:11:01,274 --> 01:11:02,168
Wake up!

644
01:11:02,234 --> 01:11:03,183
Wake up!

645
01:11:06,394 --> 01:11:08,369
Try and wake up! Come on!

646
01:11:21,756 --> 01:11:23,283
Camp Perry, Ohio.

647
01:11:29,758 --> 01:11:31,481
West Point, New York.

648
01:11:34,975 --> 01:11:36,666
Fort Knox, Kentucky.

649
01:11:46,561 --> 01:11:48,186
You can do this, Marti.

650
01:11:49,377 --> 01:11:51,766
You're doing fine. Just walk with me.

651
01:11:52,257 --> 01:11:54,297
Fort Monroe, Virginia.

652
01:11:58,722 --> 01:12:00,795
Fort Bliss, Texas.

653
01:12:04,002 --> 01:12:07,036
Where's Andy, Tim?
He's got to be in there.

654
01:12:09,187 --> 01:12:10,617
I didn't see him.

655
01:12:10,787 --> 01:12:12,216
He wasn't in there.

656
01:12:32,806 --> 01:12:34,716
My chopper's right up there.

657
01:12:37,991 --> 01:12:40,163
I'm not leaving without my brother.

658
01:12:40,743 --> 01:12:43,045
We'll get help, then come back for him.

659
01:12:46,793 --> 01:12:49,662
Do what you want,
but I'm not leaving without him.

660
01:12:57,546 --> 01:13:00,164
Didn't I tell you this place
was a freak show?

661
01:13:06,667 --> 01:13:08,074
Where are you going?

662
01:13:11,371 --> 01:13:12,648
We got work to do.

663
01:13:14,572 --> 01:13:16,645
I saw Andy. He's looking for you.

664
01:13:23,117 --> 01:13:24,295
Where?

665
01:13:49,201 --> 01:13:52,550
Marti, don't leave me!
Marti, wait, don't go!

666
01:13:54,514 --> 01:13:56,270
Don't leave me here!

667
01:14:11,859 --> 01:14:13,550
Go! Go!

668
01:14:32,599 --> 01:14:35,119
Andy, don't! What are you doing? No!

669
01:14:36,919 --> 01:14:38,348
Get him off me!

670
01:14:38,583 --> 01:14:40,241
Andy, what are you doing?

671
01:14:45,849 --> 01:14:47,376
Throw him out!

672
01:14:48,825 --> 01:14:50,167
Throw him out!

673
01:14:51,321 --> 01:14:53,460
He's not your brother!

674
01:14:54,009 --> 01:14:55,536
Throw him out!

675
01:15:35,967 --> 01:15:37,560
Should we go after them?

676
01:15:37,631 --> 01:15:40,185
Let them go. No one'll believe them.

677
01:16:16,164 --> 01:16:17,441
I'm sorry, Marti.

678
01:16:59,434 --> 01:17:01,769
They said nobody would believe us.

679
01:17:02,347 --> 01:17:04,900
Who could believe such a crazy story?

680
01:17:05,771 --> 01:17:08,073
I could hardly believe it myself.

681
01:17:13,132 --> 01:17:15,521
They had destroyed everyone I loved.

682
01:17:17,229 --> 01:17:18,276
Our reaction...

683
01:17:18,413 --> 01:17:19,908
...was only human.

684
01:17:30,670 --> 01:17:33,933
Revenge, hate, remorse, despair, pity...

685
01:17:34,927 --> 01:17:36,586
...and, most of all, fear.

686
01:17:36,687 --> 01:17:40,365
I remember feeling all those things
as I watched the bombs explode.

687
01:17:53,809 --> 01:17:55,719
How I hated them.

688
01:18:46,137 --> 01:18:48,592
Army helo-1, this is Atlanta Ground.

689
01:18:48,921 --> 01:18:51,158
You're onscreen with clearance to land.

690
01:18:51,449 --> 01:18:53,904
Runway 2-7, taxiway alpha.

691
01:18:54,362 --> 01:18:56,337
Hover taxi via east-west parallel.

692
01:18:56,570 --> 01:18:58,904
Ground crew standing by
at Army guard ramp.

693
01:18:59,163 --> 01:19:00,657
Roger that, Atlanta.

694
01:19:00,827 --> 01:19:04,122
This is High-Bird 1 1. Two-mile final.
We're coming in.

695
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:40,953
They get you when you sleep...

696
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:44,953
...but you can only stay awake so long.

697
01:19:57,922 --> 01:19:59,832
Where will you go?

698
01:20:00,738 --> 01:20:02,648
Where will you run?

699
01:20:03,779 --> 01:20:05,852
Where will you hide?

700
01:20:06,819 --> 01:20:08,249
Nowhere.

701
01:20:08,932 --> 01:20:10,754
Because there's no one...

702
01:20:11,108 --> 01:20:12,286
...like you...

703
01:20:12,516 --> 01:20:13,465
...left.

704
01:20:14,465 --> 01:20:24,465
