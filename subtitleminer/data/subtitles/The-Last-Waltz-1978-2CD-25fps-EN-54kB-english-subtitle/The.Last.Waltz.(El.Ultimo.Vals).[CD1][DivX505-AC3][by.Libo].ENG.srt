' But a Yankee laid him in his grave

471
00:48:04,282 --> 00:48:07,797
' And I swear by the mud below my feet

472
00:48:07,882 --> 00:48:14,994
' You can't raise a Caine back up
when he's in defeat

473
00:48:15,403 --> 00:48:20,352
' The night they drove old Dixie down

474
00:48:21,123 --> 00:48:23,398
' When all the bells were ringing

475
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:28,159
' The night they drove old Dixie down

476
00:48:28,963 --> 00:48:30,874
' And all the people were singing

477
00:48:30,963 --> 00:48:34,876
' They went la la-la la la-la laaa

478
00:48:35,363 --> 00:48:39,038
' La la-la la la-la la-la laaa

479
00:48:46,963 --> 00:48:51,912
' The night they drove
old Dixie down, down

480
00:48:52,683 --> 00:48:54,594
' The bells were ringing

481
00:48:54,683 --> 00:48:59,234
' The night they drove old Dixie down

482
00:49:00,003 --> 00:49:01,994
' And all the people were singing

483
00:49:02,083 --> 00:49:06,077
' They went la la-la la la-la laaa

484
00:49:06,484 --> 00:49:09,920
' La la-la la la-la la-la laaa

485
00:49:30,124 --> 00:49:32,797
A dream come true.

486
00:49:32,884 --> 00:49:34,875
Fascinating. Scary.

487
00:49:37,124 --> 00:49:40,082
Kind of hard to take the first time.

488
00:49:40,164 --> 00:49:45,443
You have to go there about two or three
times before you can fall in love with it.

489
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:47,515
But that happens eventually.

490
00:49:48,444 --> 00:49:52,483
We stayed at the Times Square Hotel
on 42nd Street.

491
00:49:53,044 --> 00:49:54,921
The title of the hotel,

492
00:49:55,004 --> 00:49:59,317
it sounded like it was conveniently
located in midtown Manhattan.

493
00:49:59,405 --> 00:50:03,762
What did we know? We came out
of the hotel after checking in,

494
00:50:03,845 --> 00:50:06,484
and you think "It's great
to be back in New York."

495
00:50:06,565 --> 00:50:09,079
Movie theatres for ever.

496
00:50:09,165 --> 00:50:13,283
All these friendly women
walking up and down the street.

497
00:50:13,645 --> 00:50:16,284
It was... It was great.

498
00:50:16,365 --> 00:50:20,244
Yeah, New York, it was an adult portion.
It was an adult dose.

499
00:50:21,525 --> 00:50:25,757
So it took a couple of trips to get into it.

500
00:50:26,685 --> 00:50:30,803
You just go in the first time and you get
your ass kicked and you take off.

501
00:50:30,885 --> 00:50:35,800
As soon as it heals up,
you come back and you try it again.

502
00:50:35,885 --> 00:50:38,683
Eventually, you fall right in love with it.

503
00:50:40,085 --> 00:50:46,035
Roulette Records was in the middle
of this mythical place, Tin Pan Alley.

504
00:50:46,125 --> 00:50:48,434
The songwriting capital of the worid.

505
00:50:48,525 --> 00:50:51,563
And we met some of
the greatest songwriters ever.

506
00:50:51,646 --> 00:50:56,595
Rock-and-roll songwriters. Doc Pomus.
Mort Shuman. Lieber and Stoller.

507
00:50:56,686 --> 00:50:59,439
They were all then.
Carole King. Neil Diamond.

508
00:50:59,926 --> 00:51:05,637
At the time it wasn't fair that a songwriter
was the low man on the totem pole.

509
00:51:05,726 --> 00:51:08,763
But then, these people...

510
00:51:08,846 --> 00:51:10,837
And here come the '60s,

511
00:51:10,926 --> 00:51:14,555
with change and revolution
and war and assassinations,

512
00:51:14,646 --> 00:51:18,036
and a whole other frame of mind
coming along.

513
00:51:18,126 --> 00:51:23,996
And these songwriters were expressing
the feelings of people in the street.

514
00:51:24,366 --> 00:51:28,723
In a way, it was kind of the beginning
of the end of Tin Pan Alley.

515
00:51:29,646 --> 00:51:31,477
(' "Dry Your Eyes")

516
00:51:38,406 --> 00:51:40,795
' Dry your eyes

517
00:51:40,886 --> 00:51:42,877
' Take your song out

518
00:51:43,806 --> 00:51:46,321
' It's a newborn afternoon

' Dry your eyes

522
00:52:02,047 --> 00:52:04,277
' And play it slowly

523
00:52:04,367 --> 00:52:07,837
' Just like you're marching off to war

524
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:13,160
' Sing it like you always wanted

525
00:52:14,407 --> 00:52:17,558
' Like you sung it once before

526
00:52:20,727 --> 00:52:24,117
' And from the centre of the circle

527
00:52:25,767 --> 00:52:28,884

00:52:47,608 --> 00:52:51,965

00:52:56,528 --> 00:53:00,885

' And we never let it go

535
00:53:07,568 --> 00:53:11,163
' And it was more than being holy

536
00:53:12,128 --> 00:53:15,325
' Though it was less than being free

537
00:53:16,448 --> 00:53:20,521
' And if you can't recall the reason

538
00:53:20,928 --> 00:53:24,716
' Can you hear the people sing?

539
00:53:27,568 --> 00:53:31,687
' Right through the lightning
and the thunder

540
00:53:32,129 --> 00:53:35,360
' To the dark side of the moon

541
00:53:36,489 --> 00:53:40,448
' To that distant falling ángel

542
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:44,524
' That descended much too soon

00:53:45,129 --> 00:53:46,960

(Robertson) Neil Diamond!

553
00:54:31,490 --> 00:54:34,482
Thanks very much.

554
00:54:39,450 --> 00:54:42,089
(Scorsese)
When you started playing as The Band,

555
00:54:42,170 --> 00:54:44,843
you shied away from publicity a lot.

556
00:54:44,930 --> 00:54:47,125
Talk about that a little.

557
00:54:47,210 --> 00:54:52,409
That was just part of a lifestyle
that we got to love in Woodstock.

558
00:54:52,490 --> 00:54:57,280
We got to like it, you know,
just being able to chop wood

559
00:54:57,370 --> 00:55:00,089
or hit your thumb with a hammer.

560
00:55:00,410 --> 00:55:06,121
We'd be concerned with fixing
a tape recorder, fixing a screen door.

561
00:55:06,210 --> 00:55:08,804
Stuff like that.
And getting the songs together.

562
00:55:09,130 --> 00:55:11,519
We always seemed
to get a whole lot more done

563
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:14,522
when we didn't have
a lot of company around.

564
00:55:15,530 --> 00:55:17,566
We were more productive.

565
00:55:17,650 --> 00:55:21,849
And as soon as company came,
of course, we'd start having fun.

566
00:55:23,251 --> 00:55:25,811
You know what happens
when you have too much fun.

567
00:55:29,171 --> 00:55:33,403
Something we've kind of evaded
around here, but I'll ask it now.

568
00:55:33,491 --> 00:55:36,722
- What about women and the road?
- I love 'em.

569
00:55:36,811 --> 00:55:39,803
That's probably why
we've been on the road.

570
00:55:40,851 --> 00:55:44,241
- That's it.
- Not that I don't like the music.

571
00:55:50,051 --> 00:55:52,884
I thought you weren't supposed
to talk about it too much.

572
00:55:52,971 --> 00:55:56,008
- No, I guess we're not.
- I thought we were supposed to...

573
00:55:56,091 --> 00:56:00,323
pan away from that sort of stuff,
get into something else.

574
00:56:00,651 --> 00:56:03,802
Since the beginning,
since we started playing together,

575
00:56:03,891 --> 00:56:07,884
just like we've all grown just a little bit,
so have the women.

576
00:56:09,571 --> 00:56:12,689
- You know? And it's amazing.
- That's right. That's good.

577
00:56:12,772 --> 00:56:14,763
I just wanna break even.
