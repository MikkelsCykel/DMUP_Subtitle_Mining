00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,440
- Package for Robert Garfield.
- Yeah.

2
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,000
- Sign here.
- Thanks.

<i>Whenever it wants, the past can come
kicking the door down.</i>

4
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,560
<i>And you never know
where it's gonna take you.</i>

5
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,640
<i>All you can do is hope
it's a place you wanna go.</i>

6
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:07,280
<i>You've reached the Garfield family.
Jill and the boys are away.</i>

7
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,920
<i>You can reach them on their cells.</i>

8
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:15,840
<i>I'll be on the road for a few days.
Be back Tuesday.</i>

00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,400
On behalf of the president
of the United States

10
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,680
I present this flag

11
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,280
for the honorable
service rendered

12
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,920
by your husband,
Major John Sullivan.

13
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,040
- Hey, Sully!
- Hey!

14
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,720
Bobby, I decided what I wanna be.
A magician.

15
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:43,120
- I'll pull rabbits out of a hat.
- Rabbits will shit in your hat.

16
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,520
But I'd be a cool bastard.
Admit it.

17
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:02,880
There's cake at the Veterans Hall.
Of course you're all welcome.

18
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,480
- Mr. Garfield.
- Mr. Oliver.

19
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:11,480
- Thanks for sending the glove.
- Been Sully's lawyer forever.

20
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:16,800
Couldn't see why a baseball glove
had to go through probate.

21
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,880
- You and Sully were kids together?
- Yeah, there were three of us.

22
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,840
Me and Sully, and a girl named Carol.

23
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,840
- Carol Gerber?
- That's right.

24
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,520
I'm hoping she'll be here.

25
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,080
You didn't hear about Carol?

26
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,640
No.

27
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,040
I'm afraid she's dead.

28
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,680
I'm so sorry.

29
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,840
<i>This street is where it all happened.</i>

30
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,640
<i>It's not much now.</i>

31
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,680
<i>Why do we always expect home
will stay the same?</i>

32
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,280
<i>Nothing else does.</i>

33
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:56,640
<i>It's funny how when you're a kid,
a day can last forever.</i>

34
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:02,800
<i>Now, all these years
seem just like a blink.</i>

35
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,480
<i>Bobby? Bobby-o?</i>

36
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,040
Time to get a wiggle on.

37
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,560
Wake up, Bobby.

38
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,240
Hey, wait for me!

39
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,840
Come on, Johnny.

40
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,360
Happy birthday, Mr. Eleven. Ta-da!

41
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,280
Oh, wow. Library card.

42
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:27,800
A grownup's library card,
if you please.

43
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,960
Thanks, Mom.

44
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,920
- Is...?
- Don't.

45
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:37,080
Don't you think I wanted to get you
a bike? I can't afford it.

46
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:41,400
Know how that makes me feel?
Your father didn't leave us well-off.

47
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,600
He did leave us three months'
unpaid rent

48
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,440
a life insurance policy that lapsed
before he died.

49
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,000
He left a rather large stack
of unpaid bills

50
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,360
which I managed to take care of.

51
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,160
People understand our situation.

52
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,440
Mr. Biderman is a good example

53
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,840
but it has not been easy.
Do you get that?

54
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:07,480
Your father never met
an inside straight he didn't like.

55
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,960
- What's an inside straight?
- Never you mind, Bobby-o.

56
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:16,720
Don't let me catch you playing cards.
I've had enough of that.

57
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,840
Come on, then.

58
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,000
That must be the new
upstairs apartment tenant.

59
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,800
I don't trust people who move their
things in paper bags. It's slutty.

60
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,680
- He has suitcases.
- Yes, but they don't match, do they?

61
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,520
Oh, hello, folks. I'm Ted Brautigan.

62
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,520
I'll be living upstairs.

63
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,560
I'm Elizabeth Garfield.
This is my son, Robert.

64
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,320
<i>Nice to meet you, Mr. Brattigan.
Tempus fugit.</i>

65
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,440
It's Brautigan,
but Ted is fine with me.

66
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,280
It's nice to meet you.
I hope you like it here.

67
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,400
Thank you, Robert.

68
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,320
Birthday boy!

69
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,640
Carol, it's hard enough
being friends without that.

70
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,680
You loved it. Here.

71
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,640
- Is this gonna be gushy?
- I don't know.

72
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,040
Better not be.

73
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,760
Whoa.

74
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,720
- Just like it.
- Yeah, that's great.

75
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,120
- Thanks.
- Sure.

76
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,400
- Didn't get the bike, did you?
- No big deal. Mom can't afford it.

77
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,840
She buys new dresses.

78
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:32,560
She has to look nice for the office.
Are you coming?

79
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,760
- Yeah.
- Come on.

80
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,560
- Hey, Sully!
- Hey!

81
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,440
- Get the bike?
- No.

82
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:53,880
Well, I got nothing for you.
But happy birthday!

83
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,680
Hang on! Wait for me!

84
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,480
- What's an inside straight?
- Something to do with gambling.

85
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:37,560
Poker. You draw a middle card.
It's dumb, strictly for suckers.

86
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,960
<i>This neighborhood
is getting terribly run-down.</i>

87
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,720
<i>I think I'll have to move.</i>

88
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,240
<i>- Yeah?
- Is that how we answer the phone?</i>

89
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:02,600
Hi, Mom. I'm sorry. I was just excited
about dinner and all.

90
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:07,120
Mr. Biderman has to work late
and needs me to do the same.

91
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,040
So birthday dinner
at the Colony is off.

92
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,240
<i>Okay, Mom.</i>

93
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,080
There are leftovers.
I'll be home to tuck you in.

94
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,120
Oh, make sure to turn
off the gas ring

95
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,480
<i>when you're done with the stove.</i>

96
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,000
- I know.
- See you soon.

97
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,360
Evening, Robert.

98
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,360
Or should I say Bobby?

99
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,320
Oh, Mr. Brautigan. Hi.

100
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,240
It's Ted.

101
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:55,280
Sorry. Ted'll be hard for me,
but I'll try.

102
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,720
You going out later?

103
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,480
I was supposed to have
a birthday dinner.

104
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,960
Mom had to stay at work,
even though she didn't want to.

105
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,120
Are you a rich man then

106
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,680
from your birthday gifts?

107
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,520
A library card?

108
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,640
No, an adult library card. Oh, my.

109
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,440
All the master storytellers
waiting for you.

110
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,000
You know why she picked it?
Because it was free.

111
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,720
That doesn't matter.
Don't you give up on this card.

112
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,640
Because books can be solid gold.

113
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,320
The great ones have gotten us
through the nights for centuries.

114
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:48,440
Give a writer an hour to hook you.
If he can't, find someone else.

115
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,280
Think you can try that?

116
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,320
If I don't have anything else to do.

117
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,120
Fair enough. Don't be afraid.

118
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,280
"A Tale of Two Cities" ends
with a beheading, great stuff.

119
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:07,640
"Lost Horizon", magic and places
unknown. Can't beat that.

120
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,400
Where'd you live before
you came here, Mr...? Ted?

121
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:16,280
Some other place
that wasn't as nice as this.

122
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,680
You lived here long?

123
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,400
Yes, sir. Since my dad died.

124
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:26,480
- When was that sad day?
- When I was 5.

125
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,000
Six years, huh?

126
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,280
You must know everything happening
on this street.

127
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:39,360
Sure do. Because nothing happens
on this street.

128
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,360
- Six years.
- That's just a blink.

129
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,480
Someday you'll agree.

130
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:52,440
You know, Ben Jonson called time
"the old bald cheater".

131
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,680
What?

132
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,640
Ben Jonson called time
"the old bald cheater".

133
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,360
I like that.

134
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,640
I think I do too. Who's Ben Jonson?

135
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,160
He's an English writer,
dead these many years.

136
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,680
Brilliant, but foolish about money.

137
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,600
And given to flatulence.

138
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:17,280
What's flatulence?

139
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:27,600
Yeah, kids always think
farts are funny.

140
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,720
Might have a job for you.
Have to think about it first.

141
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,280
Really?

142
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:40,360
Yeah. If it works out,
you might get that bike.

143
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,960
How'd you know I wanted a bike?

144
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,440
All kids want bikes.

145
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,760
Hey, Mom. I took another look
at that bike.

146
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,320
It's a Phantom, 26-incher. Real swell.

147
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,640
No, perfect. Perfect is more like it.

148
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,400
Start saving those pennies.

149
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,440
Ted? It's me.

150
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,680
Hi, kid. Come in.

151
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,480
Thanks for making the skyward journey.

152
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,280
An icy root beer awaits you as reward.

153
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,720
The colder, the better.

154
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:49,640
One feels them first at the back
of one's eyes.

155
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,800
Feels what?

156
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:58,280
One feels them first
at the back of one's eyes.

157
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,640
Yeah.

158
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,680
Hey, I did like you said.

159
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,080
- What?
- I gave him a couple of hours.

160
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,400
Oh, yeah. "Lost Horizon".
What do you think?

161
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,360
Better than the "Hardy Boys".

162
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,560
Yeah, sure is.

163
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,680
Tell me, Bobby, how'd you like
to make a dollar a week?

164
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,080
Would I ever?!

165
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,840
Well, my eyes are beginning
to fail me

166
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:33,960
and if you will read me
the "Harwich Journal" every day

167
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,160
headline stuff, sports,
comics, want ads

168
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:42,120
I'll give you said dollar.
What do you say?

169
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,680
What else?

170
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,080
What do you mean?

171
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,280
There's got to be more
to it than that.

172
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,640
Yeah, there is.

173
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,520
So, what's the real job?

174
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,720
Keep your eyes open.

175
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,920
- For what?
- Low men.

176
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,720
That's right, Bobby.

177
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:09,360
I use the term "low"
in the Dickensian sense

178
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,480
meaning dangerous. Men who stop
at nothing to get what they want.

179
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,920
Your real job will simply be

180
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,680
to walk around the area

181
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:24,040
and if you see them
or find evidence on them

182
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,120
you'll alert me immediately.

183
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:31,160
Okay. And why are they hot
on your trail?

184
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:39,480
A certain something I have.
Let's leave it at that.

185
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,160
What do they look like?

186
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:49,160
Well, they wear dark clothes,
dark hats.

187
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,400
They're kind of anonymous

188
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,520
but you can recognize their cars

189
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:58,320
Ioud and flashy.

190
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,840
When they move, they move in packs

191
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,040
like animals closing
in on the kill.

192
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,600
And they cast long shadows.

193
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,280
Oh, what a world.

194
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,320
They're not cops, are they?

195
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,800
Or secret agents?

196
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:30,040
Are you asking me if I'm a bad guy
or a commie spy?

197
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,400
I've scamped my share of fines

198
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,280
and if there were library police

199
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,080
I'd be one of their
10 most wanted.

200
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:44,280
But I never robbed a bank
or stole a military secret.

201
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,280
So who are they?

202
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,920
They're thugs, relentless

203
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,480
when they're after something.

204
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,160
- Like this something you have?
- That's right.

205
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,400
And what they want is me,
back under their control.

206
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,720
Look out. When they're closing in

207
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,040
they leave strange signs in code

208
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,440
in obvious places
like telephone poles

209
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:16,840
posters and notices
for lost pets and lost dogs.

210
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,400
If I knew what they'd do,
they'd never catch me.

211
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:26,120
- What do I do if I see them?
- Run and tell me what you've seen.

212
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,560
Remember when I asked if you knew
what was going on around here?

213
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:35,720
- Sure.
- That's why you're my man, kiddo.

214
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,440
Don't worry,
I won't let the bogeymen get you.

215
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:48,080
- Bobby?
- She can't know what you're thinking.

216
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:53,600
You think she can,
and that's a mother's power.

217
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,280
Mrs. Garfield.

218
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,520
Well, it's very cozy in here.

219
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,440
Mom, Ted... I mean, Mr. Brautigan

220
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:09,000
he's gonna pay me a dollar a week
to read him the paper.

221
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,640
Well, that's very generous.

222
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,280
Do you always have boys read to you,
Mr. Brattigan?

223
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,680
It's Brautigan, ma'am.

224
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,560
And, yes, I need someone to do it.

225
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,600
My eyes aren't what they used to be
since I retired.

226
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,240
And what did you do before that?

227
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,960
I worked up north. Various places.

228
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:39,440
Well, come along, Bobby.
Time and tide wait for no man.

229
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:43,360
- Bye, Mr. Brautigan.
- Bobby.

230
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,320
Mom, guess what Mr. Brautigan...

231
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,920
- Something doesn't make sense.
- What?

232
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:04,560
Why would a man his age wanna
spend time with a kid?

233
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,560
I don't know.

234
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,280
I do know that he said
I must be some lucky kid

235
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,480
to have a mom who'd let me

236
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,800
have a grownup library card
for my birthday.

237
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,160
I don't know. I trust him

238
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,400
about as far as I could
sling a piano.

239
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:28,560
That's right, spoil it for me.
You never want me to get that bike.

240
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,560
I do, and I wish I could've
gotten it for you.

241
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:35,600
But your father didn't exactly
leave us well-off.

242
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,960
It's only reading.

243
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,360
All right, what's the harm?

244
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,480
Yes, yes, yes!

245
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:51,640
But only on the porch,
mind, in the fresh air.

246
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,360
Okay.

247
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,200
- Bye, Bobby.
- Bye, Carol.

248
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,000
Sorry I'm late. I forgot the time.

249
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,800
That's all right.

250
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:21,480
We're all time's captives,
hostages to eternity.

251
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,640
Ben Jonson?

252
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,800
No, Boris Pasternak.

253
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:30,440
He was a Russian
of no account, I think.

254
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,840
What's going on in the world?
Something scurrilous.

255
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,280
"Vice President Richard M. Nixon

256
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,520
after having won
the Republican nomination

257
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,880
on the first ballot,
confers with Henry Cabot Lodge..."

258
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:49,400
- We're going for ice cream.
- Can't. Earning my daily bread.

259
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:54,560
- Afternoon, Mrs. Gerber. Carol.
- Hi, Ted.

260
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:59,440
I never, ever saw a girl
as special as Carol Gerber.

261
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,000
There's millions.

262
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,560
Oh, yeah?

263
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,760
- Have you kissed her yet?
- Yuck!

264
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,960
- Well, you will, I promise you.
- Stay away.

265
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,920
You will. It will be the kiss
by which all others

266
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:20,840
in your life will be judged,
and found wanting.

267
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,120
Are you done?

268
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:28,560
Yeah. Come on, read to me. Go on.

269
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:33,560
- Come back here and do your job.
- Okay.

270
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,280
But you will kiss her.

271
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,880
Oh, my God!

272
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,000
Nice going.

273
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:03,440
Get in! Get in, Bobby!

274
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,880
Come on. Come on, Sully.

275
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,160
Sully!

276
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:39,800
"FBI announces new measures
to combat Red infiltrators."

277
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,840
- Hey, Bobby.
- Yeah?

278
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:47,000
Tell me what Dale Arden's wearing
in "Flash Gordon".

279
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:50,120
What is it with you and her?

280
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:55,720
When I was younger I thought
she was a real hotsie-totsie.

281
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:00,120
Okay, before comics,
we've got sports, baseball.

282
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:04,360
"Maury Wills on the way
to break Ty Cobb's record."

283
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,280
I saw Cobb.

284
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:10,120
My dad saw Babe Ruth.
He saw him point for the home run.

285
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:13,480
Against the Cubs.
He told me all about it.

286
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:17,640
He tell you of Nagurski's
comeback game?

287
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,840
I know he saw it, though.
Were you there?

288
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:27,040
- Yeah.
- You and Dad were at the same place.

289
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,680
You know about Nagurski?

290
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,560
He was my dad's hero, that's all.

291
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,320
The greatest football player ever.
He came to Chicago

292
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,560
played eight years
to make the Bears champions.

293
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:43,440
Then he retired.
When he was old, six years retired

294
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,960
the Bears brought him back.

295
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,920
Last game of the season,
they played

296
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,320
the Cardinals, sworn enemies.

297
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,680
The Bears had to beat
the Cardinals to win.

298
00:25:55,920 --> 00:26:01,960
Nagurski wasn't supposed to play.
Third-string fullback.

299
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,680
In the first half
the starter went down.

300
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:08,280
- The second half there was a pileup.
- Oh, no.

301
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,880
If your dad was here
he'd say he was frightened.

302
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:16,720
- He was just so scared.
- But why? Nagurski was in the game.

303
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,440
I was scared too. We all were.

304
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,960
We wanted a miracle, you see, Bobby.

305
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,880
We wanted him the way he was,
the old Nagurski.

306
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,640
We wanted him the way he was
in the old days.

307
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:36,240
Did he do good?
I don't wanna hear this if he didn't.

308
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,640
The quarterback gave him the ball

309
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,280
and Nagurski ran slowly
up to the line

310
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,720
and the Cardinals crushed him.

311
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,520
But somehow

312
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:53,600
somehow, he gained a few yards.

313
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,320
Next play, the same.

314
00:26:55,560 --> 00:27:00,360
They just kept giving the ball
to the old man

315
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:07,200
and the Bears began to move down
the field, five yards, seven more.

316
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:12,360
If he could score for us,
we'd be champions again.

317
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:17,960
Go on, Ted! You can't stop!

318
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,360
Ted!

319
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:28,400
Come on. I gotta know
what happened.

320
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,160
Come on.

321
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,600
You know what your dad did then?

322
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,800
No, what did my father do?

323
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:42,560
We were all screaming. We couldn't
believe what was happening.

324
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,320
My God, what was it? Go on.

325
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:50,600
It was our miracle, you see,
because he was crawling.

326
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:54,160
Bronko Nagurski was crawling
toward the goal line

327
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:58,240
and they did everything
they could to stop him.

328
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,360
But nothing could stop him.

329
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:06,360
Yeah, that's right, Bobby.
Not on that day.

330
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,640
Not when your dad and I
saw the miracle

331
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:13,720
when the old man brought us home.

332
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,520
He scored. He scored for us.

333
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,400
We were champions again.

334
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,240
I just knew he would.

335
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:34,240
Then he was gone again,
back to the North where he came from.

336
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:37,560
Bronko Nagurski.

337
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:41,960
Bobby? Bobby-o!

338
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,000
- Ted?
- Yeah?

339
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,880
Well, I know the low men
don't exist

340
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,400
but if they started
driving around here

341
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,880
and the signs started
appearing on the poles...

342
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,920
Well, we both know
that couldn't happen.

343
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:18,280
But if it did

344
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,760
would you have to go away?

345
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,680
It wouldn't be safe
for me here.

346
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,400
And wishing cannot make it so.

347
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,440
Bobby!

348
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:00,200
Bobby? This Ted of yours

349
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,920
did he say where he's from?

350
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:08,520
Someplace not as nice as here,
I think.

351
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:13,800
Well, that doesn't tell us much,
does it?

352
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:18,760
- Anything else?
- Nope.

353
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,680
Bobby?

354
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:32,160
- Does he...?
- What?

355
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:38,120
Nothing.

356
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,560
You'll tell me if anything
unusual happens?

357
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,200
Hello?

358
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,160
Hi.

359
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,680
You promised.

360
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:55,080
I really need the...

361
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,720
Who was that?

362
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:01,920
Nothing, honey.
Just a wrong number.

363
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,560
Son of a bitch!

364
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,480
- I know it's you!
- Your mom says she's almost ready.

365
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,040
- Think Ted would come?
- To the fair?

366
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:42,200
- Don't you think we should ask?
- I guess.

367
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:46,600
- You do it. I'll get Sully.
- Okay.

368
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:52,560
- Do you like being beaten by a girl?
- Hey, no fair.

369
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:06,160
- Mr. Biderman needs me to go in.
- On Saturday?

370
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:10,400
- Some people have to work for money.
- Mom, you promised.

371
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,800
These are just Kools.
Read the advertising:

372
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:18,120
"Kools. They cool the throat."
They're hardly cigarettes at all.

373
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,640
- Mom?
- What?

374
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,840
Can I have money for the rides?

375
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,680
You never stop, do you?
Aren't you earning money now?

376
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,960
For the bike.

377
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:33,640
If you want to spend it on rides with
your girlfriend, that's your business.

378
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:55,880
Ted? It's me.
You wanna come to the fair?

379
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,320
Ted?

380
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:22,920
Is everything okay?

381
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,840
Ted, wake up.

382
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,880
Ted, you have to help me.

383
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,760
Ted, I don't know what to do.

384
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,880
They draw west now.

385
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,720
Who? Jesus, Ted, please.

386
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:52,160
They draw west now,
but they may be back.

387
00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:00,520
Ted, please.
You can't die on me.

388
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,360
Please...

389
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,480
Oh, my God.

390
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:12,280
What just happened?

391
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,480
I went off again, didn't I?

392
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:21,160
- You mean, like at the fridge?
- Yeah.

393
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:25,400
No, way worse.

394
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,680
I thought you were having a fit.

395
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,440
It's all right.

396
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:34,600
If it happens again,
don't touch me.

397
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,560
Nobody should touch me,
that's all.

398
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,840
Sorry.

399
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:46,400
- Is it safe to leave you alone?
- Yeah.

400
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:51,160
It's okay.

401
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,920
Okay.

402
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,560
Mrs. Gerber's taking us to the fair.

403
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,960
Carol and I thought you
might like to come.

404
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:11,840
Thank you, Bobby,
but I think just now, it's not wise.

405
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:15,560
- Okay.
- Okay.

406
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:25,080
The cigarettes are on the table.

407
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:28,480
Thanks, kiddo.

408
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,480
What's so funny?

409
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:36,800
You run along now. Enjoy yourself.
Don't fall out of anything.

410
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,840
Yes! That one.

411
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,160
No!

412
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,680
Yes!

413
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,120
What are you gonna name it?

414
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:30,360
All right. Step right up!
Hey, who feels lucky?

415
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,800
Find the queen of hearts and win.

416
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,640
- It already happened!
- Just once.

417
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,520
Easy peas-y Japanese-y.

418
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,760
Just find the queen of hearts.

419
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,880
- Put down your bet. I'll do it again.
- A quarter.

420
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,360
See, a jack.

421
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:53,080
We got the king and we got the queen.
Tell me where she lands.

422
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:00,320
- Fortune awaits you.
- That one there.

423
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,800
- Yes!
- Genius.

424
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:05,600
- I told you!
- Wait. Double and add a half-dollar.

425
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,400
Okay.

426
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,760
That one there.

427
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,800
- Heartbreak.
- That's enough. I have to stop.

428
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,440
- I can spot his moves.
- I better give up then.

429
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:30,760
- Just a quarter.
- One, okay.

430
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:35,800
Up and down, all around.
In and out, all about.

431
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,360
Now they're back

432
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,200
side by side.

433
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:44,160
Tell me, mister.
Where's she hide?

434
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,840
It's on the right.

435
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:50,600
No. It's the one on the left.
Right there.

436
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,120
- Okay, enough.
- There she is.

437
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,560
- Bobby was right.
- A prodigy, huh?

438
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:01,040
- Why don't you win it back?
- I could, but I can't play for money.

439
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,200
A boast-y boy.

440
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:05,360
Says he can win,
but afraid to back it up.

441
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:09,040
I could have my money back.
Come on. Beat him.

442
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:13,400
- I can't. Your mother won't be happy.
- Beat him, come on.

443
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:16,760
My mom's never happy.
It's all I got.

444
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:23,440
This is the move that stunned
the sheik of Araby. Behold.

445
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:35,120
This one here, in the middle.

446
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,840
- All right!
- That's it!

447
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,000
A lucky guess.

448
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:48,680
Double your bet.
That way we all go home happy.

449
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,800
Fine.

450
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,080
This one is five years of my life.

451
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,880
This one here.

452
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:46,440
Nobody ever beat that shuffle.

453
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:51,720
Well, mister,
is it or isn't it?

454
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,960
- Yes, that's it! Okay.
- All right!

455
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:01,120
- It was a fluke.
- You bet it was a fluke.

456
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,440
Now beat it, kid.

457
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:09,760
Okay, gang, let's go. That's enough.
Come on, Bobby.

458
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,000
Step right up!
We had a winner!

459
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:17,400
It's easy as can be.
Easy peas-y Japanese-y!

460
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,000
Yes, yes.

461
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,520
Don't be afraid.

462
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:42,720
When we swung out, I was afraid
we would fall to our doom.

463
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,760
We're as safe as can be.

464
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:51,400
What do you think you're doing?

465
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:55,760
Well, I thought you wanted me to.

466
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,280
I just wasn't ready, that's all.

467
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,360
Okay.

468
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:07,920
- Bobby, do it again.
- I better not. You'll tell.

469
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:13,360
No, it'll be our secret.
Hurry, before we go down.

470
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:20,360
Bobby, I'm dying here.

471
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:42,280
Thank you.
That was the nicest thing.

472
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:46,160
It'll be the kiss by which
all others will be judged.

473
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,840
What?

474
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:52,280
Sounded better when Ted said it.

475
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:15,480
You knew, didn't you, where
the queen of hearts was?

476
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:19,320
I could tell what was
going on in his head.

477
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:23,440
Every thought he had, I knew,
and he couldn't fool me.

478
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:27,680
Can you tell what's in Sully's head?

479
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,680
Sully's head's always empty.

480
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,880
Oh, yeah? Maybe I'm thinking
of getting a new glove.

481
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:38,200
You are?
Well, what about that one?

482
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:41,200
- Want it?
- Are you kidding? I love it!

483
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,080
- Then, Bobby, it's yours.
- It is?

484
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:47,920
I'll leave it to you in my will.

485
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:53,480
- Sully, you just love doing that!
- I got you again.

486
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,440
You know, when you're young

487
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:59,440
you have moments
of such happiness

488
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:03,920
you think you're living
in someplace magical

489
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,040
like Atlantis must have been.

490
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:12,240
- Carol, I owe you $75. It's your turn.
- Okay.

491
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,120
- Here, give me $25 back.
- Twenty-five.

492
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:17,040
- Here. $22.
- Okay. Wait, no!

493
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:21,600
- No! Hold on.
- Oh, yeah. No.

494
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:24,840
Then we grow up

495
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,000
and our hearts break in two.

496
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,640
- Yes! I own it!
- Wait, no!

497
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:35,200
- No, I do.
- He does.

498
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,400
- Come on.
- Hang on.

499
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
What is it?

500
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,320
I wonder what it means.

501
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:06,000
It means somebody lost their pet,
goofball. Come on.

502
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,680
Yeah, but maybe it's a secret code.

503
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:10,600
What are you talking about?

504
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:13,520
- Fairy. I'll take that!
- I'm not a fairy!

505
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,480
- Don't talk to them!
- How are your tits?

506
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:21,080
- Go away!
- Grow up, Harry Doolin!

507
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:25,120
The Lone Ranger.

508
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:35,320
<i>- Hi-ho, Silver!
- Bobby, how was school?</i>

509
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:37,600
- Good.
- You'll never guess.

510
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:41,760
Don... Mr. Biderman
has invited me to a seminar

511
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,480
on the weekend.
"Real Estate in the '60s."

512
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:51,640
Mr. Cushman and Mr. Dean are going,
but I was amazed he asked me.

513
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:53,720
Bobby?

514
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:57,720
I so want to be an agent.
This is a big chance for me.

515
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,560
Great, when is it?

516
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,840
Friday. Just for two nights.

517
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:05,560
- You can't go to your girlfriend's.
- She's not my girl...

518
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,320
Whatever. You can't stay there

519
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:11,800
so I'm gonna ask
Sully's mother to put you up.

520
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,920
That won't work.

521
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,960
But it has to.

522
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,960
They're gonna visit his grandma.

523
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:24,040
Just my luck.
Just my rotten luck.

524
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:33,480
Why don't you ask your friend
to come down for a cup of tea?

525
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:36,360
Okay.

526
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:44,440
I'm sorry, Mrs. Garfield, but no.

527
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:48,280
I wouldn't be much of
a babysitter for Bobby.

528
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:52,400
But I've never been invited
to a real seminar before.

529
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:56,880
You could sleep on the couch,
and you could go to the diner

530
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:01,560
and maybe even take in a movie.

531
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:06,440
I'll tell you what.
If Bobby wants me to, I will.

532
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,600
Bobby?

533
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,880
How come you get to have
all the fun?

534
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:17,680
Don't you want me to better myself?

535
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:23,000
Yeah, but what about me?
I never get what I want.

536
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:25,200
Who knows?

537
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:31,880
Maybe I'll get a raise after this.
Who knows what I can afford then?

538
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:38,040
I guess, if it's only a weekend.

539
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,160
- Thank you.
- Good.

540
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:25,160
- Have you ever heard of privacy?
- Sorry.

541
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:28,720
Wait, you can't just leave.

542
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:34,280
- What do I do, then?
- Tell me, how do I look?

543
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,080
You look like my mom.

544
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:40,600
The dress!

545
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:43,200
Wow!

546
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:46,360
Be an angel.

547
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:53,280
- Guess it must have cost a ton.
- Don't you start on that.

548
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,520
"And in this reporter's opinion

549
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:36,560
the Haywood-Albini fight
could tarnish a sterling record."

550
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,600
I'd back Hollywood Haywood any day.

551
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:43,320
Ted, you listening?

552
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:47,280
Their senses grow keener.

553
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:55,120
Hey, kiddo, you're too young to smoke.

554
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:57,080
So how long this time?

555
00:48:57,320 --> 00:49:01,280
Breaking records left and right.

556
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:05,040
Well, they're coming closer.

557
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:08,760
They're doing a good job
of hiding from me.

558
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,920
- Haven't seen a single thing yet.
- Good.

559
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:16,560
I've been wrong before.

560
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,920
So go on about the fight.

561
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:22,480
Okay. So this old guy, Albini

562
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:27,080
he's gonna take on Hollywood
Haywood tomorrow in New York.

563
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:32,360
- Sounds like Albini's gonna get beat.
- It sure does.

564
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,320
Well, I might place a bet.

565
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:37,880
We may go into town
after your mother leaves.

566
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:41,640
Get a bite to eat.
See a movie.

567
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:45,280
Ever hear of "Village of the Damned"?

568
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:51,880
It's about evil little kids
taken over by alien forces.

569
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:57,240
There you go.

570
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:11,200
What's up?

571
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:15,400
Oh, no, your bike.

572
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:21,200
Stay right there, Bobby.

573
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:46,400
<i>Thank you.</i>

574
00:50:56,840 --> 00:51:00,440
Hey, Gerber Baby!

575
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:04,160
- Still with your fairy?
- Yeah.

576
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:05,760
Come on, let's go home.

577
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,600
- Where you going?
- This isn't funny!

578
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:11,360
It's a riot, Gerber Baby.

579
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:13,040
Hey, lay off her!

580
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,600
Hey, the little guy's a hero.

581
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:19,320
Stop me, fairy.
Be a man.

582
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:21,480
I asked how your tits were.

583
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:23,320
I wanna feel for myself.

584
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:25,360
Get away from me!

585
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:27,480
Leave her alone!

586
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:29,560
She's just a Gerber Baby.

587
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:31,520
- Bastard!
- Hey, guys?

588
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:35,920
- Let's beat this queer up.
- Yeah.

589
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:49,280
- Ted, go home.
- We're all going home, Bobby.

590
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:52,720
Who's that, your fairy godfather?

591
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:56,840
Richie O'Rourke, Willie Shearman,
and Harry Doolin.

592
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:00,360
The unholy trio of St. Gabe's.

593
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:01,800
How do you know us?

594
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:06,120
Come over here.
Find out what I know.

595
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:18,920
You're going to apologize.

596
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:22,680
- I don't think so.
- Shall I tell you why?

597
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:26,120
Because I know your dark secret.

598
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:30,920
- And I will tell the world.
- I got no secret.

599
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:36,480
You like calling people queer
and fairy and such words?

600
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:39,520
Look in my eyes, Harry Doolin.

601
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:42,920
Tell me what you see.

602
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:50,000
Do you see someone in your mother's
clothes when he thinks no one is looking?

603
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:53,480
Tell the whole, wide world.

604
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:57,360
Now say, "I'm sorry, Carol."

605
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:04,000
I'm sorry, Carol.

606
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:13,120
- What did he say?
- Yeah, what?

607
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:16,160
Nothing.

608
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:19,880
Thank you, kind sir.

609
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:21,760
What did you say to him?

610
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,920
Just intellectual chitchat
among men of goodwill.

611
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,800
- Ted?
- Yes, sweet Carol?

612
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:35,920
- You're a very strange person.
- Tell no one.

613
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:38,560
All right, here we go. Come on!

614
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:39,760
Settle down.

615
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,400
Sully's got the ball!

616
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:43,720
- Oh, no!
- Oh, touchdown!

617
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,160
- Get in.
- All right.

618
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:48,360
- Get the dog!
- Come on!

619
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:53,160
- And away we go!
- Bye!

620
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:59,240
- Bye! See you.
- Have a good trip. See you.

621
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:24,120
Oh, my gosh. The low men.

622
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:31,000
Where's the little lady?

623
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:35,280
There he is. On time.
Give me a little kiss.

624
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:38,320
Get the bags, dear.

625
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:41,040
- Good afternoon.
- You look great.

626
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,920
- How are you?
- Fine.

627
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:45,520
- Here, I'll take that.
- Thank you.

628
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:50,080
- Need a hand with those, sport?
- Nope.

629
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,880
A real helpful kid there.

630
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:54,480
He's a good boy.

631
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:55,640
I'm sure he is.

632
00:54:55,880 --> 00:55:00,360
- What a beautiful day.
- Yes, it is.

633
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,200
- Mr. Cushman, Mr. Dean.
- Liz.

634
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:09,600
- Good day for a drive.
- Yes, isn't it?

635
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:12,600
Women.

636
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:16,120
Always have to bring the farm.

637
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:19,520
Well, you know what they say.

638
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:24,160
Can't live with them, can't live
without them, can't shoot them

639
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:27,720
outside of Montana.

640
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:41,160
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

641
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:45,560
But if you do, name it after me.

642
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:01,400
I trust him about as far
as I can sling a piano.

643
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:05,720
Yeah, I'm worried for my mom.

644
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:11,120
I'm worried for us all.

645
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:16,400
- So scary!
- Oh, I know!

646
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,480
- What now?
- Had enough to eat?

647
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:21,840
Are you kidding,
after those hot dogs?

648
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:24,920
So, what do they call
this part of town?

649
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:29,800
I've heard it referred to
as "down there".

650
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:32,360
You see, every city
has a place where

651
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:36,080
your last name doesn't matter.

652
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:40,800
Wine comes in a paper sack,
and you can buy anything

653
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:44,520
if you've got cash in your pocket.

654
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:47,320
Hey, come on.

655
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:51,160
- Stay close now.
- Don't worry about that.

656
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:56,160
You shouldn't be in a place like this,
but I can't leave you here. So

657
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,400
let's go.

658
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:02,720
Hollywood Haywood versus Eddie Albini,
tomorrow night, New York.

659
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:04,640
I've got money to burn.

660
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:07,720
What do you say?

661
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:11,920
Not one step.

662
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:26,000
<i>Making good on that promise,
look how he piles into Freon.</i>

663
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:36,400
Hey, kid.

664
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:38,520
What's your name?

665
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:40,880
Bobby. Bobby Garfield.

666
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:42,800
Been in before?

667
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:44,880
No, ma'am.

668
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:48,080
You look familiar.

669
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,440
Did I know your father?

670
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:56,280
My father's dead.
He died years ago.

671
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:57,680
Was he Bobby too?

672
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:01,000
Bobby Garfield. Yes, ma'am.

673
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:03,120
He was just like me.

674
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:05,160
Yeah, he was a good customer.

675
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:07,320
I liked him.

676
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:08,920
Yeah, he used to

677
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:13,680
stop in for a beer now and then.

678
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:17,360
Like on Mondays, when it's just
dead in here

679
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:21,680
and in no time flat
we were all laughing.

680
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:25,400
Yeah, not a mean bone in his body.

681
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:27,560
He was generous too.

682
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:30,920
Not too many like that in here.

683
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:34,520
He'd never buy a drunk a drink.
I admired that.

684
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:38,480
He also never met an inside
straight he didn't like.

685
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:40,680
Who told you that?

686
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:42,800
I remember the big losers.

687
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:45,320
Most nights he walked out of here

688
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:49,720
with a little more
than he came in with.

689
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:55,000
Yeah, he was a hell of a card player,
Bobby was.

690
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:03,080
Keep that, if you want.

691
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:06,800
He's handsome, don't you think?

692
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:10,760
You've got that to look forward to.

693
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:13,640
You got a girlfriend?

694
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:15,480
Yes, ma'am.

695
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17,160
Pretty?

696
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:19,760
Yes, ma'am. Her name's Carol.

697
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,560
She's a real hotsie-totsie.

698
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:26,880
A what?

699
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:28,640
Let's go. Taxi's waiting.

700
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:31,800
My dad came here!
He didn't lose our money.

701
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:35,200
He was generous and funny
and people liked him!

702
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:37,320
- Good.
- Isn't that a thing?

703
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:40,320
Yeah. Lucky for us
we came in here, I'd say.

704
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:43,880
Yes, it is a wonderful thing.

705
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:47,720
- How much did you bet?
- All I've got. $200 on Albini.

706
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:52,800
- You think Albini can beat Haywood?
- I think he can knock him out.

707
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:54,400
I bet 10-to-1 odds.

708
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:57,680
- Do you know anything about boxing?
- Nothing.

709
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:59,440
149 Broad Street.

710
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:01,000
It'll be on the radio.

711
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:03,080
We'll listen tomorrow night.

712
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:04,560
I hope you're right.

713
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:08,200
- Oh, no. Here they come! Get down!
- What is it?

714
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:12,400
Take your mind away! Don't be scared.
Think of something else.

715
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:13,680
- How?
- Carol.

716
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:17,800
Think of Carol. Don't let her go.
Think of a happy memory.

717
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:19,320
<i>Take your mind away!</i>

718
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:23,880
<i>Think of a happy memory.
Don't let her go.</i>

719
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:08,080
Good night, kiddo. I'm proud of you.

720
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:11,520
I'm sorry I didn't believe you
about the low men.

721
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:14,520
I know.

722
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:19,760
Ted, my father never bought
a drunk a drink.

723
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,560
What does that mean, exactly?

724
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:28,400
It means he was a good man.
He was honest.

725
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:31,600
And he never added
to the troubles of the world.

726
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:34,520
Okay?

727
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:38,600
- Good night.
- Good night.

728
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:49,160
<i>There's the bell.
Haywood coming out</i>

729
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:51,640
<i>throwing punches, running in.</i>

730
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:53,960
<i>Now attacking Albini at will.</i>

731
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:58,720
<i>Albini, arms hanging like weights,
occasionally throwing a weak punch.</i>

732
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:01,160
<i>The punches are flying! Hollywood...</i>

733
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:02,720
<i>Oh, my goodness!</i>

734
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:07,440
<i>Out of nowhere, a right by Albini
hits Hollywood to the head</i>

735
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:08,640
<i>and to the mat!</i>

736
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:11,680
<i>They're counting him out. 8... 9... 10!</i>

737
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:13,080
<i>Oh, my goodness!</i>

738
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:16,760
<i>One of the most improbable finishes
to a fight, ever!</i>

739
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,160
<i>Albini has beat Hollywood Haywood!</i>

740
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:23,600
<i>This one has got to be reviewed!</i>

741
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:25,360
Wow.

742
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:30,880
You just won 2000 bucks.

743
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:33,880
Hello?

744
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:35,480
Mrs. Garfield.

745
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:37,360
Yes, fine. I'll get him.

746
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:39,320
Bobby? It's your mother.

747
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:42,320
Okay.

748
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,560
<i>- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, honey.</i>

749
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:48,640
<i>- Have you missed me?
- Of course I have.</i>

750
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:51,560
But I'm trying not to be too sad.

751
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:53,400
Oh, good.

752
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:55,880
<i>- Brush your teeth.
- I did.</i>

753
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:57,400
Good boy.

754
01:02:57,640 --> 01:03:01,920
I can't chat all night. There's
a cocktail party for us delegates

755
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:05,440
down in the ballroom and I'm...

756
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:06,880
Are you there?

757
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:10,560
<i>I dropped the phone.
I love you, Bobby!</i>

758
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:13,440
Don...!

759
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:21,400
That's funny.

760
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:25,760
Got cut off.

761
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:37,720
That 2000...

762
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:43,120
- It's traveling money, isn't it?
- Yeah, it is.

763
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:50,240
I lied to you. I didn't tell you
about the lost pet sign I saw.

764
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:52,920
I know.

765
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:55,360
When will you leave?

766
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:57,920
Tomorrow, when your mother gets back.

767
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:02,040
Collect my winnings from Len Files
at the Corner Pocket

768
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:04,760
then go.

769
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:08,800
Will I ever see you again?

770
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:11,720
No.

771
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:15,560
And wishing can't make it so.

772
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:26,040
I don't want you to go.

773
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:31,520
It's all for the best, kiddo.

774
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:35,160
It's all for the best.

775
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:01,800
"In yet another startling
development in Washington

776
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:06,680
J. Edgar Hoover, the director of
the Federal Bureau of Investigation

777
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:10,920
today issued a statement denying
the Bureau was involved

778
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:17,040
in recruiting psychics
in the battle against Communism."

779
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:27,400
That's really what all this is about,
isn't it, Ted?

780
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:35,240
Want a root beer?

781
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:40,760
That's the only good thing about you
going. I can't stand that stuff.

782
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,480
Yeah, I know.

783
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:47,960
- Do you know everything?
- Nope.

784
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:51,400
So what happens when you touch people?

785
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:57,240
I pass on a kind of window
into other people's minds.

786
01:05:57,320 --> 01:06:00,320
Is that why they want you?
This window?

787
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:04,640
Yeah. I know certain things,
see certain things.

788
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:08,320
Some see it as a gift,
but to me it's always been a burden.

789
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:11,400
What I see has a value for some.

790
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:13,840
Maybe I escaped them this time.

791
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:16,360
Thanks.

792
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:18,040
Cheers.

793
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:21,200
To good health.

794
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:24,120
Oh, well.

795
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:27,800
We're all just passing through, kiddo.

796
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:31,760
Just passing through, that's all.

797
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:35,640
Tell Carol I'd like to
say goodbye to her.

798
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:38,400
Sure.

799
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:46,080
- Hey, Bobby!
- Yeah?

800
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:50,080
I think you should go find her now.

801
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:52,920
Okay.

802
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:26,560
- Hey, Bobby.
- Is Carol home?

803
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:28,960
No, she went to the ravine
to read

804
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:32,240
<i>by the tree.</i>

805
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,840
You don't scare me, Bobby Garfield.

806
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:03,760
If it isn't the Gerber Baby.

807
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:09,840
No! Please!

808
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:13,040
Harry?

809
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:30,800
Carol! Carol!

810
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:49,960
Is everything okay?

811
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:53,200
He hit me, Bobby. He hit me hard.

812
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:55,000
It's okay.

813
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:57,440
- I'll go get help!
- No, please!

814
01:08:57,680 --> 01:09:00,120
Don't leave me alone.
He might come back.

815
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:01,400
It'll be okay.

816
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:03,000
Can you walk?

817
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:04,120
I don't know.

818
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:08,600
- Just try, okay?
- Maybe, I don't know.

819
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:11,840
It'll be okay.

820
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:16,440
It's okay.
Here, try and stand up, okay?

821
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:28,320
You have to get on my back, okay?

822
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:33,480
- Bobby, I can't!
- Yes, you can.

823
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:34,680
You can.

824
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:39,760
You have to think about
something else, okay?

825
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:41,920
Here, get on my back.

826
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:45,400
Remember at school how we
rode piggyback at recess?

827
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:49,600
- Yeah.
- This is just like that, okay?

828
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:15,400
<i>- Bronko Nagurski.
- Nagurski.</i>

829
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:22,840
<i>Ten yards</i>

830
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:26,920
<i>seven yards...</i>

831
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:33,960
<i>Nothing could stop him.</i>

832
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:05,320
Ted!

833
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:07,960
Help.

834
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:09,800
I think her arm's broken.

835
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:13,600
Come on, Carol. It's all right.

836
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:28,480
It's all right.

837
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:29,920
My arm.

838
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:33,840
Bobby, take her hand, all right?

839
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:36,920
Oh, yes.

840
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:40,120
One great, big boy
against one little girl.

841
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:44,920
He's probably so afraid of you.
Thought you had the heart of a lion.

842
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:47,080
He hurt me, Ted.

843
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:49,880
I know. Believe me, I know.

844
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:54,400
Now listen. I've got to look
at your shoulder. Understand?

845
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:57,400
I don't want to hurt you.

846
01:11:57,640 --> 01:11:59,520
Oh, my.

847
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:01,520
He broke my arm.

848
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:04,600
No, I think it's just dislocated.

849
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:08,080
And I think I can fix it.

850
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:11,760
Are you a doctor, Ted?

851
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,840
No, I'm not a doctor.

852
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:16,520
But as you noted, I'm very strange.

853
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:18,960
So who knows what I can do?

854
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:22,920
Do you have the heart of a lion?

855
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:27,440
Just close your eyes
and try to relax.

856
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:31,280
Bobby, give me your belt.

857
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:34,640
Now, Carol, do you know
what pain does?

858
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:37,800
It rises and travels up the body.

859
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:39,800
That's it. Thank you.

860
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:41,600
Listen to me, Carol.

861
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:43,680
Just listen and relax.

862
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:46,600
I want you to bite down hard
on the belt.

863
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:51,800
You're going to bite down
on Bobby's belt and catch the pain.

864
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:53,640
Now relax.

865
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:55,480
Close your eyes.

866
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:57,160
Keep them closed.

867
01:12:57,400 --> 01:13:00,160
You're safe. Just breathe in.

868
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:03,600
Breathe out. That's it.
There's no pain.

869
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:07,760
Just listen to my voice.

870
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:11,320
I can sense them
closing in on me, Bobby.

871
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:14,720
I know. There's signs everywhere.

872
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:16,320
Here we go.

873
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:20,680
Bite down hard and catch... Here we go.

874
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:24,400
All right.

875
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:25,560
There.

876
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:27,480
Ted?

877
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:30,480
It doesn't hurt anymore.

878
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:33,360
You do have the heart of a lion.

879
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:35,280
You did well, kiddo.

880
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:38,400
What the hell is going on in here?

881
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:40,440
Mom, what happened to you?

882
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:45,320
- Take your hands off that little girl!
- Mom, he didn't do anything bad!

883
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:47,800
How dare you touch her!

884
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:49,640
He didn't hurt her!

885
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:52,400
I brought her so Ted could help her!

886
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:56,280
Go to your room!
And you! You are going to jail!

887
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:59,920
What happened to you
didn't happen to her.

888
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:02,920
- Why's her blouse open?
- Her shoulder's hurt!

889
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:04,840
I said, go to your room!

890
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:08,520
What Bobby said was true!

891
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:12,040
Let's clean you up in the bathroom.

892
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:14,520
He carried me up the hill.

893
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:16,920
Ted took my pain away.

894
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:19,360
Don't you touch her!

895
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:21,520
Go in the bathroom.

896
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:24,920
I'm calling the police
to tell them everything.

897
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:28,440
Tell them what happened to you.

898
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:31,120
You weren't there. You couldn't know.

899
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:32,760
I know.

900
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:36,480
I know you didn't realize
the seminar would involve that.

901
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:42,160
And I know he's growing up
while your mind is on other things.

902
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:50,760
I'm taking that child home. And you
better not be here when I get back.

903
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:59,640
- Be careful.
- I'll be fine, don't worry.

904
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:02,000
Where will you go till it's dark?

905
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:07,280
The diner near the Corner Pocket,
I guess. Pick up my winnings later.

906
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:09,960
I want to go with you.

907
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:12,480
Bobby, come inside, please.

908
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:15,840
Do as she says, kiddo.

909
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:01,200
<i>Yes, is this</i>

910
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:04,840
<i>Housatonic-5837?</i>

911
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:07,920
Yes, well, I have some information
for you

912
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:10,840
about Brautigan.

913
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:14,400
You can find him at
the Corner Pocket tonight

914
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:16,720
in Bridgeport.

915
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:19,640
Yes. Now, there's a reward...?

916
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:20,800
Hello?

917
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:23,560
Hello...

918
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:29,800
Bastards.

919
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:02,160
<i>When your mother writes "bad"</i>

920
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:07,480
under a mental picture of someone,
she writes it in ink.

921
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:13,640
I mean, I knew that, but
I didn't think she'd betray me.

922
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:20,680
See, I need the money to survive

923
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:24,440
and I can't go back
to the Corner Pocket.

924
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:27,920
And I need time to think

925
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:31,400
and there isn't any.

926
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:40,120
Here's what you do.

927
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:41,880
Write a note for me.

928
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:43,720
A note?

929
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:46,320
Yeah, to the Corner Pocket.

930
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:49,880
I'll get you your money.

931
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:53,400
I'm not sure this is a good idea.

932
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:56,680
Ted, take my hands.

933
01:17:56,720 --> 01:18:02,480
Don't worry. I won't let
the bogeymen get you.

934
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:37,160
<i>Hello?</i>

935
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:40,640
<i>Can I help you?</i>

936
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:44,640
It's about Brautigan.
He took the train. I saw him go.

937
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:47,160
<i>Stay out of this, kid.</i>

938
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:51,200
<i>Brautigan's our business.</i>

939
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:55,760
Don't hurt him.

940
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:59,400
Please don't hurt him.

941
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:03,040
<i>Go home, Bobby.</i>

942
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:54,000
Ted, I got the money!

943
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:07,640
Ted!

944
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:27,680
I wouldn't have missed a minute!

945
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:30,760
Not a single minute!

946
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:34,680
Not for the whole world!

947
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,520
Where have you been?
I've been worried!

948
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:03,840
I'm all safe and sound.

949
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:07,680
Do you have any idea
what you just put me through?

950
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:12,200
You only think about yourself!

951
01:22:12,440 --> 01:22:13,960
- Bobby...
- Ted's gone.

952
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:16,880
I'll never see him again.

953
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:19,960
So you got everything you wanted.
Happy?

954
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:22,600
There's no money. I don't have a job.

955
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:26,040
There's plenty of money now!

956
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:29,360
See how great it worked out,
turning him in?

957
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:31,840
I did it for you. For your own...

958
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:36,920
You lie! You always lie.

959
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:42,360
My father was a good man
and people liked him.

960
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:45,120
Everyone liked him except you.

961
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:47,840
You never liked me either.

962
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:52,960
Then I find a grownup friend
of my own, and you know what?

963
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:55,960
I loved him.

964
01:22:56,120 --> 01:23:01,640
You didn't just betray him;
you betrayed both of us.

965
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:12,960
Bobby?

966
01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:23,960
<i>Ted got it right.</i>

967
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:28,120
<i>It isn't all Atlantis.</i>

968
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:31,200
<i>My mother got a job outside of Boston.</i>

969
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:34,760
<i>And I was upset, of course,
but one thing...</i>

970
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,920
<i>I wasn't afraid.</i>

971
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:40,520
<i>I had Ted to thank for that.</i>

972
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:43,720
Hey, get out of here.
This is my place now.

973
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:46,280
You can't. This is everybody's park.

974
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:49,600
Yes, I can.

975
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:53,400
Little Bobby Garfield.

976
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:58,080
Where's your fairy godfather
when you need him?

977
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:22,640
That was for the Gerber Baby!

978
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:14,400
Do you need any help?

979
01:25:14,640 --> 01:25:17,520
I'm fine.

980
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:41,280
Do you think you could ever
see your way to forgiving me?

981
01:25:44,160 --> 01:25:47,960
I'm working on it, Mom.

982
01:26:15,240 --> 01:26:18,600
Carol, we're leaving now.

983
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:21,720
Oh, no.

984
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:24,440
Here. It's where I'll be
in Massachusetts.

985
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:27,560
- Will you write to me?
- Of course.

986
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:30,160
I'll write to you.

987
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:33,280
I'll probably be homesick.

988
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:37,160
I'll never forget you.

989
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:45,880
Was it you who beat up Harry Doolin?

990
01:26:46,440 --> 01:26:48,400
Good.

991
01:26:48,640 --> 01:26:51,120
Good.

992
01:27:00,160 --> 01:27:03,760
- Carol, wait.
- I can't. Not now.

993
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:08,720
- But l...
- I love you too, Bobby Garfield.

994
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:12,760
But I have to go make the salad.

995
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:23,840
<i>9:35, 25 minutes before 10
on WKMD</i>

996
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:28,800
<i>serving up the biggest hits
with the Platters.</i>

997
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:36,960
So, what are we gonna do?

998
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:42,520
The best we can, Mom.
The best we can.

999
01:27:43,640 --> 01:27:46,000
Well, time and tide wait for no man.

1000
01:27:46,240 --> 01:27:49,120
Ben Jonson called time
"the old bald cheater".

1001
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:52,160
- Who was Ben Jonson?
- An English writer.

1002
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:55,680
Foolish about money,
and given to flatulence.

1003
01:27:55,920 --> 01:27:59,080
Flatulence?

1004
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:02,920
Bobby Garfield!

1005
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:33,920
Hey!
I don't think you should be in there.

1006
01:28:34,160 --> 01:28:36,160
It's not safe.

1007
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:40,640
I used to live here when I was a kid.

1008
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:47,920
- Have you lived here long?
- Only my whole life.

1009
01:28:48,160 --> 01:28:52,480
Oh, wait a minute! Wait, wait, wait.

1010
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:57,360
Was your mother

1011
01:28:57,760 --> 01:29:00,480
was she...?

1012
01:29:00,720 --> 01:29:04,440
Was she Carol, Carol Gerber?

1013
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:10,440
- My mom's dead. She died years ago.
- I was sorry to hear that.

1014
01:29:12,040 --> 01:29:16,520
We never kept in touch
like we said we would.

1015
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:21,560
My God.

1016
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:25,240
You're the boy on the Ferris wheel?

1017
01:29:25,480 --> 01:29:31,840
- Mom told me about that.
- She promised she'd never tell anyone.

1018
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:36,360
She said you were beautiful.

1019
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:41,360
One of us was.

1020
01:30:13,720 --> 01:30:18,080
You can keep that, if you want.

1021
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:22,440
I'm Bobby.

1022
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:27,360
- Molly.
- Molly.

1023
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:35,520
She had the heart of a lion.

1024
01:31:13,880 --> 01:31:17,240
<i>I never heard from
Ted Brautigan again.</i>

1025
01:31:17,480 --> 01:31:21,520
<i>Not that I didn't think of him.
I always have</i>

1026
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:24,800
<i>and always will.</i>

1027
01:31:25,160 --> 01:31:30,880
<i>Because that summer was the last
of my childhood.</i>

1028
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:35,280
<i>And though I never again saw
what people were thinking</i>

1029
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:40,280
<i>there was an enduring gift
that he left me.</i>

1030
01:31:40,520 --> 01:31:45,280
<i>What Ted did was open my eyes</i>

1031
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:49,240
<i>and let the future in.</i>

1032
01:31:50,040 --> 01:31:53,760
<i>I wouldn't have missed a minute of it.</i>

1033
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:57,400
<i>Not for all the world.</i>

1034
01:31:58,400 --> 01:32:08,400
