1
00:00:42,408 --> 00:00:44,408
Bruja.

2
00:00:49,148 --> 00:00:51,148
Bruja.

3
00:00:53,452 --> 00:00:55,943
Bruja.

4
00:00:56,688 --> 00:01:00,419
Bruja.

5
00:01:05,197 --> 00:01:07,197
Please don't hurt me.

6
00:02:24,576 --> 00:02:26,879
Oh shit. Thanks. I
didn't even see that.

7
00:02:26,979 --> 00:02:28,979
Neither did I.

8
00:02:29,781 --> 00:02:35,287
People saw, seeing is believing.
But for me, that's not entirely true.

9
00:02:35,387 --> 00:02:38,123
I lost my sight when
I was five years old.

10
00:02:38,223 --> 00:02:40,125
Those memories of
what I have seen...

11
00:02:40,225 --> 00:02:42,116
Have faded so much, I doubt that

12
00:02:42,216 --> 00:02:44,229
I'd even recognize
myself anymore.

13
00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:46,865
Now I see using my other senses.

14
00:02:46,965 --> 00:02:49,368
I can smell the rain before it drops.

15
00:02:49,468 --> 00:02:51,003
But I can't watch it fall.

16
00:02:51,103 --> 00:02:53,338
I can feel the sun on my face.

17
00:02:53,438 --> 00:02:55,374
But I can't see it rise or set.

18
00:02:55,474 --> 00:02:57,876
I want to see the world
like everyone else.

19
00:02:57,976 --> 00:03:01,377
To see the sun, the
rain. And music...

20
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,960
I bet music looks beautiful.

21
00:04:00,472 --> 00:04:03,192
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

22
00:04:06,578 --> 00:04:08,578
Taste's good.

23
00:04:08,847 --> 00:04:10,115
Happy Birthday.

24
00:04:10,215 --> 00:04:12,215
Thank you.

25
00:04:15,487 --> 00:04:16,688
Evening Miss Wells.

26
00:04:16,788 --> 00:04:18,788
Hi Miguel, thank you.

27
00:04:18,957 --> 00:04:20,957
You're welcome.

28
00:04:21,393 --> 00:04:22,661
Lilies?

29
00:04:22,761 --> 00:04:23,829
New just this morning.

30
00:04:23,929 --> 00:04:25,834
Myself, I prefer roses.

31
00:04:25,934 --> 00:04:29,334
But you're the first
one that's noticed.

32
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,670
Nervous about tomorrow.

33
00:04:33,805 --> 00:04:35,805
No.

34
00:04:38,343 --> 00:04:42,848
Actually... I've never been
so scared in my entire life.

35
00:04:42,948 --> 00:04:46,089
Listen, the night
before my mother's...

36
00:04:46,189 --> 00:04:49,674
surgery, she drank
two glasses of sherry.

37
00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:52,658
Steady as a rock the next day.

38
00:04:52,758 --> 00:04:56,216
- Thank you. Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

39
00:05:13,078 --> 00:05:15,647
This is Doctor Haskin's office
calling from County general...

40
00:05:15,747 --> 00:05:17,393
...your procedure is
still on schedule...

41
00:05:17,493 --> 00:05:18,850
for tomorrow. Be sure to arrive...

42
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:23,222
...at the hospital four hours before
for pre-op. Thank you.

43
00:05:23,322 --> 00:05:27,926
Hi sweetie, it's your sister.
My flight gets in at 5 am...

44
00:05:28,026 --> 00:05:29,861
The whole crew's got a lay over...

45
00:05:29,961 --> 00:05:32,358
...so I'll find someone
to give me a ride...

46
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:33,799
straight to the hospital.

47
00:05:33,899 --> 00:05:35,534
I love you Sydney.

48
00:05:35,634 --> 00:05:38,034
Can't wait to see you. Bye.

49
00:05:51,216 --> 00:05:53,275
12:10 AM

50
00:07:22,441 --> 00:07:23,475
Hello?

51
00:07:23,575 --> 00:07:25,575
Shh...

52
00:07:25,644 --> 00:07:27,145
Martha will hear you.

53
00:07:27,245 --> 00:07:28,780
She's on from 12 'til 6

54
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,683
And she takes away my M&M's
if I get out of bed.

55
00:07:31,783 --> 00:07:33,251
I'm Alicia.

56
00:07:33,351 --> 00:07:35,354
I'm holding out my hand to shake.

57
00:07:35,454 --> 00:07:36,788
I'm Sydney.

58
00:07:36,888 --> 00:07:38,888
I know, Sydney Wells.

59
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:42,861
I kinda read your chart.
You're the cornea transplant.

60
00:07:42,961 --> 00:07:44,129
How old are you?

61
00:07:44,229 --> 00:07:48,432
9 and 1/2. There's this
like... golf ball thing...

62
00:07:48,532 --> 00:07:50,068
inside my head?

63
00:07:50,168 --> 00:07:51,169
It made me so dizzy...

64
00:07:51,269 --> 00:07:52,756
...I couldn't ride my bike.

65
00:07:52,856 --> 00:07:55,140
So the doctor's are
trying to get it out.

66
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,708
When do you get to see?

67
00:07:56,808 --> 00:07:58,610
Pretty soon I think.

68
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,345
Good. I'll come back.

69
00:08:00,445 --> 00:08:03,590
- And you can take a look at me.
- Okay.

70
00:08:04,783 --> 00:08:06,783
Bye, nice to meet you.

71
00:08:07,152 --> 00:08:09,152
Bye.

72
00:08:16,561 --> 00:08:19,398
I'm starting to lose the feeling
in my fingers.

73
00:08:19,498 --> 00:08:21,498
Me too.

74
00:08:23,902 --> 00:08:27,030
Ok, if you'll excuse me please.

75
00:08:29,307 --> 00:08:31,307
All right...

76
00:08:32,544 --> 00:08:35,247
All right, Sydney.
I'm going to take the bandages off.

77
00:08:35,347 --> 00:08:36,047
Okay.

78
00:08:36,147 --> 00:08:38,147
- ...you ready?
- Yeah.

79
00:08:50,395 --> 00:08:52,395
That's one.

80
00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:01,570
That's two... Okay, now I'm going...

81
00:09:01,806 --> 00:09:05,469
...to help you open your eyes.
Very slowly.

82
00:09:06,044 --> 00:09:08,044
Okay.

83
00:09:11,216 --> 00:09:13,216
Slowly, slowly, slowly.

84
00:09:20,325 --> 00:09:22,960
Okay, now tell me what you see.

85
00:09:31,469 --> 00:09:33,469
I can't...

86
00:09:34,372 --> 00:09:36,837
I'm going to hold up my hand.

87
00:09:37,142 --> 00:09:41,562
And I want you to tell me
how many fingers I have up.

88
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,849
Five. Those are fingers.

89
00:09:43,949 --> 00:09:45,949
Yes they are.

90
00:09:46,251 --> 00:09:48,251
All right, here we go.

91
00:09:50,188 --> 00:09:51,490
All of them?

92
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:54,218
Yes. Very good.

93
00:09:57,095 --> 00:09:58,930
- Sydney...
- Yeah?

94
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:03,399
I want you to try and reach out
and grab my hand.

95
00:10:04,569 --> 00:10:06,569
Okay?

96
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:14,045
Okay, it's okay.

97
00:10:14,145 --> 00:10:17,290
Not everybody can
do this right away.

98
00:10:27,392 --> 00:10:30,282
It burns a little. Is that normal?

99
00:10:30,729 --> 00:10:33,024
Yes, it's perfectly normal.

100
00:10:33,064 --> 00:10:34,132
Very good.

101
00:10:34,232 --> 00:10:36,232
Thank you.

102
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:41,070
Am I how you pictured?

103
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:48,437
I don't know, you're really blurry.

104
00:10:51,616 --> 00:10:53,818
I wish mom and dad were here
to see this.

105
00:10:53,918 --> 00:10:55,918
Yeah.

106
00:10:56,855 --> 00:10:59,410
I think I wanted
this more than you,

107
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:01,510
Sydney.

108
00:11:03,161 --> 00:11:05,161
Not when you were 12.

109
00:11:06,231 --> 00:11:11,586
I waited for this for 15 years.
I thought I'd feel a sense of...

110
00:11:12,037 --> 00:11:13,638
It's sort of like...

111
00:11:13,738 --> 00:11:16,571
It's not your fault. Hey...

112
00:11:20,845 --> 00:11:22,845
It's not your fault.

113
00:11:26,484 --> 00:11:28,484
I'm sorry...

114
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:32,215
You just need time.
You'll see.

115
00:11:39,264 --> 00:11:41,264
Goodnight. I love you.

116
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:43,399
I love you too.

117
00:11:59,851 --> 00:12:01,851
Sydney?

118
00:12:02,353 --> 00:12:06,756
Can you see me?
Don't feel bad if you can't.

119
00:12:08,693 --> 00:12:10,328
What's that on your head?

120
00:12:10,428 --> 00:12:13,531
It's a bandana,
my grandpa gave it to me.

121
00:12:13,631 --> 00:12:15,533
You know maybe tomorrow
we can take a walk...

122
00:12:15,633 --> 00:12:18,169
And I can show you
the park outside.

123
00:12:18,269 --> 00:12:19,104
The palm trees...

124
00:12:19,204 --> 00:12:20,271
Alicia.

125
00:12:20,371 --> 00:12:21,373
Oh, coming...

126
00:12:21,473 --> 00:12:23,473
Sasquatch, I got to go.

127
00:12:24,109 --> 00:12:26,109
Bye.

128
00:12:49,801 --> 00:12:53,862
Please... I don't want to go...

129
00:13:03,081 --> 00:13:05,081
Mrs. Hillman?

130
00:13:16,494 --> 00:13:18,494
Mrs. Hillman?

131
00:13:21,366 --> 00:13:23,366
Mrs. Hillman.

132
00:13:27,972 --> 00:13:30,097
Where are you taking her?

133
00:14:02,307 --> 00:14:04,307
Mrs. Hillman?

134
00:14:26,998 --> 00:14:29,123
Where are you taking her?

135
00:15:02,734 --> 00:15:07,671
I'm freezing... I'm freezing...

136
00:15:09,274 --> 00:15:11,274
Freezing...

137
00:15:11,342 --> 00:15:13,342
Freezing...

138
00:15:13,611 --> 00:15:16,603
I'm freezing.

139
00:15:44,042 --> 00:15:46,042
Where's Mrs. Hillman.

140
00:15:46,311 --> 00:15:49,796
Oh, I'm sorry.
She passed away last night.

141
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:04,319
Everything is just perfect.
You are recovering quite nicely.

142
00:16:05,396 --> 00:16:07,031
And the tearing stopped?

143
00:16:07,131 --> 00:16:09,131
I think so, yeah.

144
00:16:09,167 --> 00:16:11,167
Good.

145
00:16:14,772 --> 00:16:16,897
So whose eyes were these?

146
00:16:17,075 --> 00:16:18,142
Excuse me?

147
00:16:18,242 --> 00:16:20,011
My donor?

148
00:16:20,111 --> 00:16:21,846
I'm afraid I can't help you with that,
Sydney.

149
00:16:21,946 --> 00:16:23,648
These are your eyes now,
and they're working.

150
00:16:23,748 --> 00:16:25,850
It shouldn't matter
where they came from?

151
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,585
Does that hurt

152
00:16:27,685 --> 00:16:29,685
A little?

153
00:16:29,921 --> 00:16:31,921
Okay.

154
00:16:33,558 --> 00:16:36,561
When will I be able
to see more clearly?

155
00:16:36,661 --> 00:16:40,398
Well it varies with each patient.
Couple of days, couple of weeks.

156
00:16:40,498 --> 00:16:43,167
But your vision itself
isn't the issue.

157
00:16:43,267 --> 00:16:45,177
Since you've been blind so long,

158
00:16:45,277 --> 00:16:47,739
I'm going to refer
you to a specialist...

159
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,174
...Paul Faulkner, he'll help you.

160
00:16:50,274 --> 00:16:52,545
It's okay, I got it.

161
00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:57,237
All right, have a nice
day off tomorrow.

162
00:16:57,515 --> 00:16:59,515
Thanks Sydney.

163
00:18:22,266 --> 00:18:23,735
Hi.

164
00:18:23,835 --> 00:18:25,835
Hey.

165
00:18:26,671 --> 00:18:29,440
Are you ready to
be my tour guide?

166
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,875
You're leaving?

167
00:18:30,975 --> 00:18:32,950
Yeah, I'm afraid
they've had enough of...

168
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:34,679
me here. This is my sister, Helen.

169
00:18:34,779 --> 00:18:35,813
Helen, this is Alicia.

170
00:18:35,913 --> 00:18:37,081
Hi. Hi.

171
00:18:37,181 --> 00:18:39,217
Hey, can we get a
picture together?

172
00:18:39,317 --> 00:18:40,051
Of course.

173
00:18:40,151 --> 00:18:42,191
- Here, I'll do it.
- Okay.

174
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:52,957
I know you're scared,
Sydney, don't be.

175
00:18:53,431 --> 00:18:56,662
The world, it's really beautiful.

176
00:18:57,602 --> 00:18:59,602
Okay, smile.

177
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:08,103
My carry-on's in the trunk,

178
00:19:08,346 --> 00:19:11,406
And clean, go to
some art galleries.

179
00:19:12,283 --> 00:19:14,519
Is it too much for you. Should we...

180
00:19:14,619 --> 00:19:16,320
...pull over or something,
just say the word, okay.

181
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,906
No, no. We can talk everyday,

182
00:19:18,006 --> 00:19:19,757
you can come over
and check on me.

183
00:19:19,857 --> 00:19:23,276
I just... think I really
need to do this...

184
00:19:23,376 --> 00:19:24,629
on my own, okay?

185
00:19:24,729 --> 00:19:26,729
Okay. I understand.

186
00:19:37,008 --> 00:19:38,609
Got some new lamps
for your place.

187
00:19:38,709 --> 00:19:39,577
Oh, thanks.

188
00:19:39,677 --> 00:19:41,677
I put them in.

189
00:19:41,879 --> 00:19:44,279
- Here, I'll do it.
- Okay.

190
00:19:51,923 --> 00:19:53,923
Surprise.

191
00:19:59,163 --> 00:20:01,499
This is too soon I know,
I don't know what I was thinking.

192
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:03,568
No, no, it's okay. It's okay.

193
00:20:03,668 --> 00:20:06,000
Do I know any of you?

194
00:20:06,337 --> 00:20:07,438
Welcome home.

195
00:20:07,538 --> 00:20:09,273
Oh hi Jim.

196
00:20:09,373 --> 00:20:11,242
How are you doing?
Great to see you.

197
00:20:11,342 --> 00:20:12,410
Nice to see you too.

198
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:15,479
Sydney, it's Bret. Welcome home.

199
00:20:16,147 --> 00:20:18,683
Hey Syd it's me,
Alex, from upstairs.

200
00:20:18,783 --> 00:20:21,503
Oh Alex... Wow, nice to see you.

201
00:20:22,253 --> 00:20:23,955
It's your cousin, Sarah.

202
00:20:24,055 --> 00:20:27,855
Oh Sarah, it's been so long.

203
00:20:28,459 --> 00:20:29,293
I'm so happy.

204
00:20:29,393 --> 00:20:31,393
Recognize my voice.

205
00:20:32,263 --> 00:20:33,331
Oh, hi Cynthia.

206
00:20:33,431 --> 00:20:34,665
How'd you know it was me?

207
00:20:34,765 --> 00:20:36,734
How could I not, Cynthia.

208
00:20:36,834 --> 00:20:38,269
What's up girl?

209
00:20:38,369 --> 00:20:40,369
Oh, Richard.

210
00:20:43,241 --> 00:20:46,972
So, this is what bald looks like.

211
00:20:47,745 --> 00:20:49,940
Hey Sydney. How are you?

212
00:20:50,147 --> 00:20:50,915
- Miguel.
- Yeah.

213
00:20:51,015 --> 00:20:52,850
- How are you?
- you look good.

214
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:54,950
It's Amanda.

215
00:21:11,669 --> 00:21:12,276
Hey, are you okay,

216
00:21:12,376 --> 00:21:13,604
do you need some
water or anything.

217
00:21:13,704 --> 00:21:16,799
Yeah, I'm going to
go to the kitchen,

218
00:21:16,899 --> 00:21:19,874
why don't you stay with the guests.

219
00:23:20,431 --> 00:23:22,431
1:06AM...

220
00:23:38,249 --> 00:23:39,417
- Hi.
- Hi.

221
00:23:39,517 --> 00:23:42,953
Sorry I'm late. That's Henry.

222
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:47,425
I'm Paul.

223
00:23:47,525 --> 00:23:49,525
Sydney.

224
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:54,530
Have a seat.

225
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:10,147
You damaged your corneas
when you were 5?

226
00:24:10,247 --> 00:24:13,551
Yeah, my sister and I
were playing with firecrackers.

227
00:24:13,651 --> 00:24:16,087
I tried a transplant when I was 12...

228
00:24:16,187 --> 00:24:17,722
But I rejected them.

229
00:24:17,822 --> 00:24:20,362
Stem cell research
changed the game.

230
00:24:20,462 --> 00:24:22,426
Is that why you tried again?

231
00:24:22,526 --> 00:24:25,726
No, my sister was
really the one that...

232
00:24:25,826 --> 00:24:28,206
kept up with all that stuff.

233
00:24:33,637 --> 00:24:36,347
These are Doctor
Haskin's test results.

234
00:24:36,447 --> 00:24:39,510
There's nothing physically
wrong with you...

235
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:42,413
The operation went flawlessly.
But you're probably in for a shock.

236
00:24:42,513 --> 00:24:43,280
Why?

237
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:46,303
You already filter
information from sound,

238
00:24:46,403 --> 00:24:48,052
smell, touch. But now...

239
00:24:48,152 --> 00:24:51,410
...you're going to be
assaulted by a million...

240
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:53,924
things you never
even knew existed.

241
00:24:54,024 --> 00:24:56,788
A whole new level of confusion.

242
00:24:57,094 --> 00:24:59,756
Do I look here, or
here. Is that bright...

243
00:24:59,856 --> 00:25:02,066
thing important or this dark one...

244
00:25:02,166 --> 00:25:04,311
...moving towards
me or away from me.

245
00:25:04,411 --> 00:25:05,369
Dangerous or not?

246
00:25:05,469 --> 00:25:09,607
As long as your eyes are open
there's just too many distractions,

247
00:25:09,707 --> 00:25:11,542
I mean, how do you concentrate.

248
00:25:11,642 --> 00:25:14,145
I'm talking to you, and you're...

249
00:25:14,245 --> 00:25:16,601
...looking at that
woman. And you're...

250
00:25:16,701 --> 00:25:18,749
thinking is she going to eat that.

251
00:25:18,849 --> 00:25:21,352
That's a pineapple by the way.
You cut it open...

252
00:25:21,452 --> 00:25:23,452
I like pineapple.

253
00:25:24,922 --> 00:25:28,067
Anyway, because you
can see people...

254
00:25:28,158 --> 00:25:30,261
...you're going to expect people
to do things you can't do.

255
00:25:30,361 --> 00:25:32,530
Read signs, recognize
body language.

256
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:36,367
Recognize facial expressions.
Get out of their way.

257
00:25:36,467 --> 00:25:39,570
Your eyes will want to dominate
how you perceive the world.

258
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:42,106
But you can't fully
trust them. Not yet.

259
00:25:42,206 --> 00:25:44,075
In the next few weeks,
I'm going to help you...

260
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:45,676
see the world like it really is, okay?

261
00:25:45,776 --> 00:25:48,563
A lot of it is going to be difficult,

262
00:25:48,663 --> 00:25:51,449
but the main thing
is to be prepared.

263
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:53,844
And that's where I come in.

264
00:25:54,018 --> 00:25:56,483
Okay? We're in this together.

265
00:27:30,381 --> 00:27:32,381
Oh, you scared me.

266
00:27:45,829 --> 00:27:46,931
Hey...

267
00:27:47,031 --> 00:27:49,496
Have you seen my report card?

268
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Your report card?

269
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:56,407
Do you live here sweetie?

270
00:27:56,507 --> 00:28:01,672
My Father will be so mad at me.
Have you seen my report card?

271
00:28:45,289 --> 00:28:47,124
I'm sorry.

272
00:28:47,224 --> 00:28:49,224
Let's take five.

273
00:28:49,626 --> 00:28:53,366
I'm sorry.
I don't know what's wrong with me.

274
00:28:53,697 --> 00:28:55,499
Relax.

275
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:57,639
You're pushing too hard.

276
00:29:10,814 --> 00:29:12,669
You know when I first
went to London...

277
00:29:12,769 --> 00:29:14,184
to work with the Philharmonic.

278
00:29:14,284 --> 00:29:19,214
I was so nervous. In Prague,
I was a big fish. In London...

279
00:29:19,523 --> 00:29:21,523
...one of the hundreds.

280
00:29:22,326 --> 00:29:24,876
But you did so well in London.

281
00:29:25,129 --> 00:29:27,831
I never thought I would be ready.

282
00:29:27,931 --> 00:29:32,959
But when it was time to go on,
everything faded away...

283
00:29:33,337 --> 00:29:35,973
It was just me and the music,
face to face.

284
00:29:36,073 --> 00:29:39,133
I wasted so much
time being worried.

285
00:29:39,343 --> 00:29:42,488
But there was nothing
to worry about.

286
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:47,178
And now our spring
concert series...

287
00:29:48,786 --> 00:29:50,254
...is almost upon us. Sydney?

288
00:29:50,354 --> 00:29:51,455
Will you be ready?

289
00:29:51,555 --> 00:29:53,765
We're all counting on you.

290
00:29:55,459 --> 00:29:56,860
I'll be ready.

291
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,796
I'm sure you'll be.

292
00:29:58,896 --> 00:30:00,497
Number 42.

293
00:30:00,597 --> 00:30:04,897
42, that's us. You sit
tight, I'll get it.

294
00:30:05,102 --> 00:30:05,969
Thanks.

295
00:30:06,069 --> 00:30:08,069
42?

296
00:30:10,707 --> 00:30:14,022
Oh I ordered a salad.
Can you change it?

297
00:30:14,144 --> 00:30:16,144
Yes.

298
00:30:18,015 --> 00:30:21,330
You think I'm just
going to let you go?

299
00:30:21,585 --> 00:30:23,854
You think I'm not
going to do something.

300
00:30:23,954 --> 00:30:25,954
That's it, right?

301
00:30:29,293 --> 00:30:30,928
I'm gonna do it.

302
00:30:31,028 --> 00:30:32,329
I'm sorry?

303
00:30:32,429 --> 00:30:35,149
I told you I was going to do it.

304
00:30:39,536 --> 00:30:41,536
Don't go.

305
00:31:01,792 --> 00:31:04,682
There was a woman,
she came at me.

306
00:31:06,063 --> 00:31:09,260
What woman? What woman?

307
00:31:11,468 --> 00:31:15,293
Christ's sake,
get a hold of yourself, please.

308
00:31:16,139 --> 00:31:18,139
Sorry.

309
00:31:18,342 --> 00:31:20,342
I'm sorry.

310
00:31:22,012 --> 00:31:23,280
I apologize.

311
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,380
It's all right.

312
00:33:34,011 --> 00:33:37,410
Well, from the latest results,

313
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:41,713
there's nothing
wrong with your eyes.

314
00:33:44,287 --> 00:33:46,018
Well maybe there's
something wrong...

315
00:33:46,118 --> 00:33:46,790
with the tests.

316
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:50,494
Tests only gauge the fact that
you gave no abnormal responses.

317
00:33:50,594 --> 00:33:51,709
Creative ones, yeah,

318
00:33:51,809 --> 00:33:54,264
the kind that artists
and musicians give...

319
00:33:54,364 --> 00:33:57,434
...but the last I checked,
you are a musician.

320
00:33:57,534 --> 00:34:01,338
I'm sure other musicians don't see
what I've been seeing.

321
00:34:01,438 --> 00:34:03,438
Come with me.

322
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:05,041
I'm not an idiot,

323
00:34:05,141 --> 00:34:07,277
I understand what
you're telling me.

324
00:34:07,377 --> 00:34:08,670
My brain is having to relearn...

325
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:10,147
how to decode the
world around me.

326
00:34:10,247 --> 00:34:11,829
But that's very different from me...

327
00:34:11,929 --> 00:34:13,784
seeing things, that
don't seem to be real.

328
00:34:13,884 --> 00:34:14,484
How...

329
00:34:14,584 --> 00:34:17,485
Look, you're real...

330
00:34:18,188 --> 00:34:19,823
Okay...

331
00:34:19,923 --> 00:34:21,923
You're here.

332
00:34:22,492 --> 00:34:26,326
My perspective and
focus is off, but...

333
00:34:26,596 --> 00:34:29,895
You're real. I can see you.

334
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:38,530
We see what we look
at. But the way that...

335
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:41,078
we see things is affected
by what we know...

336
00:34:41,178 --> 00:34:41,945
And there's a lot around you...

337
00:34:42,045 --> 00:34:43,347
That you can't make sense of yet.

338
00:34:43,447 --> 00:34:48,976
What are you saying to me?
You think, I'm making this up?

339
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,723
You think I want this
happening to me?

340
00:34:52,823 --> 00:34:54,253
I think you're not
going to be able to...

341
00:34:54,353 --> 00:34:55,025
push through this...

342
00:34:55,125 --> 00:34:56,460
I think you were better off before...

343
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:00,056
All special, well you
just discovered...

344
00:35:00,156 --> 00:35:02,499
you're like the rest of us.

345
00:35:02,799 --> 00:35:04,799
Stop it.

346
00:35:05,869 --> 00:35:08,164
You know when we first met.

347
00:35:09,339 --> 00:35:12,399
I didn't think you
were such an ass.

348
00:35:13,076 --> 00:35:15,712
That's because
you didn't know how to spot one.

349
00:35:15,812 --> 00:35:17,147
See...

350
00:35:17,247 --> 00:35:19,247
Progress.

351
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:29,410
Have a good evening Mrs. Chueng.

352
00:35:31,027 --> 00:35:36,124
Ahh, Miss Wells. Your
new TV is here...

353
00:35:36,366 --> 00:35:37,745
...my buddy from
the cable company...

354
00:35:37,845 --> 00:35:38,335
hooked you up.

355
00:35:38,435 --> 00:35:39,336
Thank you Miguel.

356
00:35:39,436 --> 00:35:41,671
And welcome
to the 200 channel universe.

357
00:35:41,771 --> 00:35:42,672
Thanks.

358
00:35:42,772 --> 00:35:44,772
- Bye.
- Good night.

359
00:38:12,689 --> 00:38:14,891
Hi, this is Helen,
I'm out of town until Saturday...

360
00:38:14,991 --> 00:38:18,795
...so if you need to contact me,
do so after the beep.

361
00:38:18,895 --> 00:38:22,228
Hey, it's Syd. Please call me.

362
00:38:36,579 --> 00:38:38,579
What are you doing.

363
00:38:55,031 --> 00:38:59,468
Call 911. Somebody call 911.

364
00:39:04,974 --> 00:39:06,974
She's not breathing.

365
00:40:56,786 --> 00:40:57,505
Hi, you've reached...

366
00:40:57,605 --> 00:40:59,055
the cell phone of
Doctor Paul Faulkner...

367
00:40:59,155 --> 00:41:01,725
...leave a message after the beep.

368
00:41:01,825 --> 00:41:09,322
Hi Paul, it's Sydney.
I'm at a Chinese Restaurant...

369
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:12,744
...at the corner of
4th and Figueroa.

370
00:41:14,971 --> 00:41:17,351
Something's happening to me.

371
00:41:19,542 --> 00:41:24,707
I need you to come, please.

372
00:41:44,667 --> 00:41:46,667
Excuse me.

373
00:43:42,151 --> 00:43:46,884
Sydney, Sydney. It's
me. It's me. It's me.

374
00:43:52,528 --> 00:43:54,528
This place...

375
00:43:55,798 --> 00:44:00,132
No, no, no. I was just here...

376
00:44:00,403 --> 00:44:01,104
I was just here.

377
00:44:01,204 --> 00:44:02,972
What are you talking about?

378
00:44:03,072 --> 00:44:04,240
This place...

379
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:06,338
There was a fire in
here, there was a fire...

380
00:44:06,438 --> 00:44:08,344
in here weeks ago, five
people were killed.

381
00:44:08,444 --> 00:44:10,480
It was in the newspapers,
it was all over the press...

382
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:13,708
- I was just here...
- Hey...

383
00:44:16,386 --> 00:44:17,487
What's wrong?

384
00:44:17,587 --> 00:44:20,723
Everything's wrong.
Everything's wrong.

385
00:44:20,823 --> 00:44:23,026
My apartment keeps changing.

386
00:44:23,126 --> 00:44:25,595
It was filled with smoke and
I was attacked...

387
00:44:25,695 --> 00:44:26,863
What do you mean
you were attacked.

388
00:44:26,963 --> 00:44:28,247
...by this man... He
was on fire then...

389
00:44:28,347 --> 00:44:29,465
he was gone.
Everything was gone...

390
00:44:29,565 --> 00:44:30,751
So I had to get out of there.

391
00:44:30,851 --> 00:44:32,335
And I was walking
down the street...

392
00:44:32,435 --> 00:44:33,469
And...

393
00:44:33,569 --> 00:44:38,174
...this woman walks through me.
She walked right through me.

394
00:44:38,274 --> 00:44:41,377
And I saw the shadow...
I saw it before...

395
00:44:41,477 --> 00:44:45,387
...at the hospital.
It's some kind of escort...

396
00:44:45,415 --> 00:44:48,815
That takes people away when
they're dead.

397
00:44:49,218 --> 00:44:52,946
There's something so
angry about them.

398
00:44:53,046 --> 00:44:55,680
They don't want to be seen.

399
00:44:57,660 --> 00:44:59,329
And then, this...

400
00:44:59,429 --> 00:45:00,763
I see people...

401
00:45:00,863 --> 00:45:02,903
...like nothing's wrong.

402
00:45:03,066 --> 00:45:04,267
When they...

403
00:45:04,367 --> 00:45:06,302
...don't seem to see me.

404
00:45:06,402 --> 00:45:07,503
Sydney, listen to me.

405
00:45:07,603 --> 00:45:09,472
I'm seeing things that aren't real.

406
00:45:09,572 --> 00:45:12,575
I'm seeing things
that I shouldn't see.

407
00:45:12,675 --> 00:45:15,820
I'm dreaming things,
I've never seen.

408
00:45:16,813 --> 00:45:19,849
This surgery was supposed to
make me normal.

409
00:45:19,949 --> 00:45:24,784
Sydney... Your eyes
are not the problem.

410
00:45:25,354 --> 00:45:27,822
These eyes are not my eyes.

411
00:45:28,257 --> 00:45:29,258
Yes, they are.

412
00:45:29,358 --> 00:45:33,385
- No, they're not.
- Yes, they are.

413
00:45:33,663 --> 00:45:34,964
Listen to me.

414
00:45:35,064 --> 00:45:37,266
You've got a disorder, all right.

415
00:45:37,366 --> 00:45:40,436
We've got to teach your brain
how to separate out...

416
00:45:40,536 --> 00:45:42,705
...these ghost images
from the real thing.

417
00:45:42,805 --> 00:45:47,480
You're not listening to me.
I'm not seeing ghost images.

418
00:45:49,278 --> 00:45:50,179
I see...

419
00:45:50,279 --> 00:45:52,279
What? Dead people?

420
00:45:52,348 --> 00:45:54,651
Rooms that change...
Phantom escorts...

421
00:45:54,751 --> 00:45:59,851
Whatever it is that you
believe you're seeing, it's not real.

422
00:46:01,758 --> 00:46:03,758
It's not.

423
00:46:05,595 --> 00:46:07,595
It's not real.

424
00:46:07,864 --> 00:46:09,864
You don't believe me.

425
00:46:12,001 --> 00:46:13,536
I want to help you.

426
00:46:13,636 --> 00:46:15,636
How can you?

427
00:46:15,705 --> 00:46:18,850
How can you, if you
don't believe me.

428
00:46:55,278 --> 00:46:57,278
You gettin' on or what?

429
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:53,136
It's not real...

430
00:47:53,236 --> 00:47:55,236
It's not real...

431
00:48:01,277 --> 00:48:02,445
It's not real...

432
00:48:02,545 --> 00:48:04,147
It's not real...

433
00:48:04,247 --> 00:48:08,684
It's not real...

434
00:48:10,786 --> 00:48:16,520
It's not real...

435
00:48:49,158 --> 00:48:51,160
Have you seen my report card?

436
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:52,562
Have you seen my report card?

437
00:48:52,662 --> 00:48:55,028
No. I already told you.

438
00:48:56,032 --> 00:48:57,733
Have you seen my report card?

439
00:48:57,833 --> 00:48:59,833
Stop asking me.

440
00:49:04,573 --> 00:49:06,573
No.

441
00:49:07,677 --> 00:49:09,677
No.

442
00:49:35,438 --> 00:49:37,903
Have you seen my report card?

443
00:50:39,001 --> 00:50:40,625
It's your sister Helen,

444
00:50:40,725 --> 00:50:43,806
I'm on my way to the
airport. Are you okay?

445
00:50:43,906 --> 00:50:47,476
Will you call me, on my cell,
okay. Please.

446
00:50:58,921 --> 00:51:02,015
You're scaring me
sweetie, pick up.

447
00:51:03,426 --> 00:51:06,134
Okay I'm going to call
someone, I'm going to...

448
00:51:06,234 --> 00:51:08,531
call someone unless
you pick up, Sydney.

449
00:51:08,631 --> 00:51:10,631
Sydney?

450
00:51:13,235 --> 00:51:14,804
Miss Wells.

451
00:51:14,904 --> 00:51:18,032
Sydney? It's Paul,
are you in there?

452
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:21,995
The doorman's going to let me in,
all right?

453
00:51:41,163 --> 00:51:42,531
Will you give us a minute.

454
00:51:42,631 --> 00:51:44,631
Sure.

455
00:51:54,243 --> 00:51:56,713
Your sister called, she said...

456
00:51:56,813 --> 00:52:00,043
you hadn't answered
the phone in days.

457
00:52:15,531 --> 00:52:16,966
What is this?

458
00:52:17,066 --> 00:52:19,361
You want to be blind again?

459
00:52:20,002 --> 00:52:20,770
At least do it right.

460
00:52:20,870 --> 00:52:22,709
When you were blind,
you had a life, you...

461
00:52:22,809 --> 00:52:24,473
were engaged in a
world. You had a job,

462
00:52:24,573 --> 00:52:25,841
what is this?

463
00:52:25,941 --> 00:52:29,036
You get scared and
you just drop out.

464
00:52:29,136 --> 00:52:32,791
Run back to your room,
turn off the lights.

465
00:53:01,610 --> 00:53:03,079
What now?

466
00:53:03,179 --> 00:53:05,115
I'm going to take you
to the hospital and...

467
00:53:05,215 --> 00:53:06,215
get this cut sewn up.

468
00:53:06,315 --> 00:53:08,315
Is it really necessary?

469
00:53:08,350 --> 00:53:12,377
Yeah.

470
00:53:31,473 --> 00:53:34,076
I think you should keep her here
over night,

471
00:53:34,176 --> 00:53:36,471
here's my telephone number.

472
00:53:51,093 --> 00:53:55,757
Sydney Wells? You're back?

473
00:53:57,833 --> 00:53:59,833
Alicia?

474
00:54:00,502 --> 00:54:02,138
What are you doing in here?

475
00:54:02,238 --> 00:54:04,507
The golf ball's gone, Sydney Wells.

476
00:54:04,607 --> 00:54:06,475
- What?
- I have to go now.

477
00:54:06,575 --> 00:54:08,575
Wait. Hang on.

478
00:54:09,311 --> 00:54:11,311
Alicia?

479
00:54:22,191 --> 00:54:25,183
I know you're scared, don't be.

480
00:54:25,527 --> 00:54:28,757
Because the world
really is beautiful.

481
00:54:34,603 --> 00:54:35,905
No.

482
00:54:36,005 --> 00:54:38,005
No. Alicia.

483
00:54:38,941 --> 00:54:40,941
Don't go with him.

484
00:54:41,877 --> 00:54:43,877
Alicia.

485
00:54:44,313 --> 00:54:46,313
Alicia.

486
00:55:34,897 --> 00:55:36,897
How are you?

487
00:55:42,371 --> 00:55:43,505
Whatever's happening...

488
00:55:43,605 --> 00:55:46,665
There's nothing that can't be fixed.

489
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:52,915
Morning.

490
00:55:53,015 --> 00:55:54,216
Morning.

491
00:55:54,316 --> 00:55:55,150
How's the hand.

492
00:55:55,250 --> 00:55:57,250
It's fine.

493
00:55:59,388 --> 00:56:01,991
Alicia's mother wanted
you to have this.

494
00:56:02,091 --> 00:56:03,859
Said, she talked about
you all the time.

495
00:56:03,959 --> 00:56:07,189
She was smiling up
until the very end.

496
00:56:14,236 --> 00:56:16,236
Who is she?

497
00:56:17,039 --> 00:56:18,474
That's you, Sydney.

498
00:56:18,574 --> 00:56:20,376
That's not me.

499
00:56:20,476 --> 00:56:21,277
Of course it is...

500
00:56:21,377 --> 00:56:23,417
...who else would it be.

501
00:56:42,264 --> 00:56:43,966
Sydney...

502
00:56:44,066 --> 00:56:46,066
What are you doing?

503
00:56:50,539 --> 00:56:54,999
Sydney, you're scaring me.

504
00:57:05,954 --> 00:57:07,954
What do you see?

505
00:57:14,763 --> 00:57:17,433
Cellular memory,
based on the theory that all...

506
00:57:17,533 --> 00:57:19,135
...living tissues have
the capacity to...

507
00:57:19,235 --> 00:57:20,235
remember...

508
00:57:20,335 --> 00:57:23,806
...cellular memory explains
how energy and information...

509
00:57:23,906 --> 00:57:26,842
...from a donor's tissue
can transfer consciously...

510
00:57:26,942 --> 00:57:29,445
...or unconsciously
to the recipient.

511
00:57:29,545 --> 00:57:32,181
Recently, recipients of
organ transplants...

512
00:57:32,281 --> 00:57:35,250
...have begun to report
episodes of newfound memories...

513
00:57:35,350 --> 00:57:37,753
...thoughts, emotions
and characteristics...

514
00:57:37,853 --> 00:57:42,018
...that are often associated to
the original donor

515
00:57:42,090 --> 00:57:43,092
Paul.

516
00:57:43,192 --> 00:57:44,927
Sydney, I can't talk right now,
I have to go to a meeting.

517
00:57:45,027 --> 00:57:47,896
Listen. There's no history of
schizophrenia in my family.

518
00:57:47,996 --> 00:57:50,050
I've never suffered from
any mental condition,

519
00:57:50,150 --> 00:57:51,700
not depression,
migraines, nothing.

520
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:55,504
So, for argument's sake
Let's just pretend I'm not crazy.

521
00:57:55,604 --> 00:57:57,673
All right, walk with me then.

522
00:57:57,773 --> 00:57:59,196
There have been cases
of transplant...

523
00:57:59,296 --> 00:58:00,642
recipients who've
actually showed...

524
00:58:00,742 --> 00:58:01,810
...characteristics of the donor.

525
00:58:01,910 --> 00:58:03,612
Right. Cellular Memory.

526
00:58:03,712 --> 00:58:05,686
There was a liver
transplant patient...

527
00:58:05,786 --> 00:58:06,982
in Kentucky last year...

528
00:58:07,082 --> 00:58:09,585
...that almost immediately felt
the urge to pick up smoking.

529
00:58:09,685 --> 00:58:10,919
A health nut all her life.

530
00:58:11,019 --> 00:58:12,454
The donor was a chain smoker.

531
00:58:12,554 --> 00:58:14,156
Down to the same brand.

532
00:58:14,256 --> 00:58:15,707
And a few years ago this
little girl helped...

533
00:58:15,807 --> 00:58:17,192
the police solve the
murder of the person...

534
00:58:17,292 --> 00:58:18,127
she got her heart from.

535
00:58:18,227 --> 00:58:20,245
She kept having
visions of the crime.

536
00:58:20,345 --> 00:58:22,531
There's some kind of
chemical... It's...

537
00:58:22,631 --> 00:58:23,632
Peptides.

538
00:58:23,732 --> 00:58:25,033
It's how the mind
and body communicate.

539
00:58:25,133 --> 00:58:27,264
So it's not too big a leap
to suggest memories...

540
00:58:27,364 --> 00:58:29,138
can be accessed from
these organs, too...

541
00:58:29,238 --> 00:58:31,173
No, because corneas aren't
a major organ,

542
00:58:31,273 --> 00:58:32,474
it's like changing the
windshield of a car.

543
00:58:32,574 --> 00:58:35,889
But there's still a
chance isn't there?

544
00:58:36,945 --> 00:58:40,073
I... I need that chance.

545
00:58:41,383 --> 00:58:44,119
I need to find out
who the donor was.

546
00:58:44,219 --> 00:58:46,889
I see her in the mirror every day.

547
00:58:46,989 --> 00:58:49,624
I have to find out who she was.

548
00:58:52,861 --> 00:58:55,666
That is confidential information.

549
00:58:55,697 --> 00:59:00,999
You can't ask me to do that.
I could lose my license.

550
00:59:03,105 --> 00:59:05,105
Your license...

551
00:59:06,742 --> 00:59:08,310
Well by all means...

552
00:59:08,410 --> 00:59:10,620
...hold onto that license.

553
00:59:35,871 --> 00:59:37,871
Sydney?

554
00:59:39,942 --> 00:59:41,942
Sydney, come on.

555
00:59:50,686 --> 00:59:52,221
Thank you.

556
00:59:52,321 --> 00:59:54,321
What floor?

557
01:00:14,610 --> 01:00:16,610
Excuse me.

558
01:00:16,745 --> 01:00:18,745
Sorry.

559
01:00:19,915 --> 01:00:21,915
Thank you.

560
01:00:31,693 --> 01:00:33,693
He's here, isn't he

561
01:00:35,197 --> 01:00:37,197
My Tomi.

562
01:00:42,371 --> 01:00:44,371
What was that about?

563
01:00:48,310 --> 01:00:50,310
Who's Tomi?

564
01:00:52,381 --> 01:00:54,381
Her son.

565
01:00:54,416 --> 01:00:56,416
Where was he?

566
01:00:57,319 --> 01:00:59,319
He's dead.

567
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:27,240
Who are you?

568
01:02:29,711 --> 01:02:31,711
What do you want?

569
01:02:34,883 --> 01:02:36,883
I want to help you...

570
01:02:37,319 --> 01:02:38,387
...but how can I...

571
01:02:38,487 --> 01:02:40,527
...if you won't tell me.

572
01:03:30,739 --> 01:03:34,197
Sydney, are you okay?

573
01:03:34,643 --> 01:03:36,144
Sydney, open up.

574
01:03:36,244 --> 01:03:38,046
Open up.

575
01:03:38,146 --> 01:03:40,146
Sydney, open up.

576
01:03:41,116 --> 01:03:42,451
What the Hell is going on.

577
01:03:42,551 --> 01:03:43,518
I need to find out who she is.

578
01:03:43,618 --> 01:03:45,618
- Who?
- My donor.

579
01:03:45,654 --> 01:03:47,255
Her eyes, my eyes.

580
01:03:47,355 --> 01:03:48,557
I've seen what she saw.

581
01:03:48,657 --> 01:03:50,058
I'm seeing what killed her.

582
01:03:50,158 --> 01:03:51,193
Sydney, please...

583
01:03:51,293 --> 01:03:52,694
Helen, don't.

584
01:03:52,794 --> 01:03:53,794
I love you,

585
01:03:53,894 --> 01:03:55,797
but there's no way
you can help me.

586
01:03:55,897 --> 01:03:57,232
You're not making sense.

587
01:03:57,332 --> 01:04:00,420
It's all happening to
me. Everything that...

588
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:03,038
happened to her, is
happening to me.

589
01:04:03,138 --> 01:04:05,688
Until I find out who she is...

590
01:04:06,975 --> 01:04:11,225
And what she wants...
it's going to keep happening.

591
01:04:25,627 --> 01:04:27,627
County General please.

592
01:04:28,630 --> 01:04:30,630
Hey, hey, hey.

593
01:04:42,677 --> 01:04:44,179
The only...

594
01:04:44,279 --> 01:04:47,048
...cornea transplant that
matches the date of your surgery...

595
01:04:47,148 --> 01:04:51,278
...came from a Clinica Saint Javier,
Los Llanos.

596
01:04:51,620 --> 01:04:53,915
Your donor was from Mexico.

597
01:04:56,224 --> 01:04:58,224
Do you get car sick?

598
01:04:58,260 --> 01:04:59,694
Why?

599
01:04:59,794 --> 01:05:01,794
It's a 15 hour drive.

600
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:14,240
Thank you.

601
01:05:26,588 --> 01:05:29,758
The file says your donor was
Anna Christina Martinez.

602
01:05:29,858 --> 01:05:33,161
One living relative, mother.
Worked in a ceramics factory.

603
01:05:33,261 --> 01:05:35,981
Hopefully we can track her down.

604
01:05:39,901 --> 01:05:42,791
So what made you
change your mind?

605
01:05:42,837 --> 01:05:44,837
About what?

606
01:05:45,507 --> 01:05:47,776
About coming down here with me?

607
01:05:47,876 --> 01:05:51,446
Can't you just let me sabotage
my career in peace.

608
01:05:51,546 --> 01:05:56,476
I was just wondering why
you changed your mind, that's all.

609
01:05:57,419 --> 01:05:59,884
Is it because you believe me?

610
01:06:22,677 --> 01:06:24,677
Paul, stop the car.

611
01:06:31,353 --> 01:06:32,954
What do you see?

612
01:06:33,054 --> 01:06:36,539
There was a fire here.
I keep seeing fire.

613
01:06:50,872 --> 01:06:53,507
Hey, maybe they know something.

614
01:06:59,748 --> 01:07:01,748
Hola chico. - Hola.

615
01:07:12,060 --> 01:07:15,664
All the doors were locked,
and nobody could get out.

616
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:20,600
He lost a brother.

617
01:07:20,835 --> 01:07:22,835
How did it happen?

618
01:07:29,544 --> 01:07:32,264
He says something about a witch.

619
01:08:27,602 --> 01:08:29,204
You see that, bruja?

620
01:08:29,304 --> 01:08:32,865
Yeah, actually I've seen it before.

621
01:08:35,176 --> 01:08:37,176
That means, witch.

622
01:08:56,931 --> 01:08:59,067
I don't think anyone's here.

623
01:09:06,374 --> 01:09:08,243
Hola.

624
01:09:08,343 --> 01:09:10,078
Hola, Senor Martinez.

625
01:09:10,178 --> 01:09:11,880
No. I work here.

626
01:09:11,980 --> 01:09:14,644
Is someone from the
Martinez family here,

627
01:09:14,744 --> 01:09:16,084
that we can speak to?

628
01:09:16,184 --> 01:09:19,839
Senora Martinez is here,
but she is resting.

629
01:09:20,021 --> 01:09:23,616
Oh well we could
wait, it's important.

630
01:09:24,692 --> 01:09:26,327
Emilio.

631
01:09:26,427 --> 01:09:29,021
Come in...

632
01:09:30,532 --> 01:09:32,532
- Come in.
- Thank you.

633
01:09:40,808 --> 01:09:43,868
Please don't be
long, She's not well

634
01:09:52,587 --> 01:09:53,955
Mrs. Martinez...

635
01:09:54,055 --> 01:09:55,369
My name is Sydney Wells.

636
01:09:55,469 --> 01:09:57,692
And this is my friend
Dr. Paul Faulkner.

637
01:09:57,792 --> 01:09:59,792
What do you want?

638
01:10:02,864 --> 01:10:06,601
Well we would like to talk to you
about your daughter.

639
01:10:06,701 --> 01:10:08,536
I was wondering about...

640
01:10:08,636 --> 01:10:10,636
...how she died.

641
01:10:11,239 --> 01:10:13,608
What business is this of yours.

642
01:10:13,708 --> 01:10:15,043
It's hard to explain...

643
01:10:15,143 --> 01:10:20,979
...see I have a connection.
With your daughter.

644
01:10:46,274 --> 01:10:48,274
You have her eyes.

645
01:10:57,118 --> 01:10:59,587
I'm sorry for how I
look, there was...

646
01:10:59,687 --> 01:11:02,917
...a fire in the factory where I work.

647
01:11:03,024 --> 01:11:04,959
Did your daughter die in the fire?

648
01:11:05,059 --> 01:11:09,120
No. But many others did.

649
01:11:09,564 --> 01:11:13,735
If they had listened to Anna,
they would have been saved.

650
01:11:13,835 --> 01:11:15,503
What do you mean by that?

651
01:11:15,603 --> 01:11:17,603
It doesn't matter now.

652
01:11:19,941 --> 01:11:26,369
Did Anna ever see things
she couldn't explain.

653
01:11:27,982 --> 01:11:29,982
Do you see things?

654
01:11:33,388 --> 01:11:34,989
Things that are not real.

655
01:11:35,089 --> 01:11:37,089
Yeah...

656
01:11:37,358 --> 01:11:41,262
It's a terrible thing to see
the spiritual world, isn't it?

657
01:11:41,362 --> 01:11:42,764
The souls destined...

658
01:11:42,864 --> 01:11:47,235
...to repeat their death, everyday,
unable to find peace.

659
01:11:47,335 --> 01:11:49,335
Yeah...

660
01:11:49,570 --> 01:11:51,570
Anna was always alone.

661
01:11:51,773 --> 01:11:54,509
People around here,
they were always afraid of her.

662
01:11:54,609 --> 01:11:55,977
They would blame her.

663
01:11:56,077 --> 01:11:58,202
Why would they blame her?

664
01:12:03,351 --> 01:12:05,820
One time when she was a little girl.

665
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:09,190
She would sit in front of
the person's house and she...

666
01:12:09,290 --> 01:12:12,782
...would just cry. And soon after...

667
01:12:13,094 --> 01:12:15,563
...somebody in that
house, would die.

668
01:12:15,663 --> 01:12:17,365
I know that she wasn't
doing these things...

669
01:12:17,465 --> 01:12:19,467
...she wasn't bringing
death to anyone.

670
01:12:19,567 --> 01:12:22,229
But she could just...

671
01:12:22,570 --> 01:12:24,570
...see death.

672
01:12:25,506 --> 01:12:28,409
This is a small town.
Many superstitions.

673
01:12:28,509 --> 01:12:29,877
Bruja.

674
01:12:29,977 --> 01:12:31,813
The graffiti outside.

675
01:12:31,913 --> 01:12:35,689
As if they have nothing
better to do all day...

676
01:12:35,789 --> 01:12:37,829
than cover your house...

677
01:12:41,356 --> 01:12:43,481
- Call an ambulance.
- What?

678
01:12:43,825 --> 01:12:45,825
Call an ambulance.

679
01:12:49,630 --> 01:12:51,766
Every night... Every night...

680
01:12:51,866 --> 01:12:54,002
...she does it again, and again.

681
01:12:54,102 --> 01:12:55,670
Please, save her...

682
01:12:55,770 --> 01:12:59,103
Save her... Save her... Save her...

683
01:12:59,307 --> 01:13:00,008
What happened.

684
01:13:00,108 --> 01:13:02,110
She's having a heart attack.
We got to get her to a hospital.

685
01:13:02,210 --> 01:13:04,505
Help me put her in the car.

686
01:13:04,512 --> 01:13:05,713
You ready, got her?

687
01:13:05,813 --> 01:13:09,298
- Where's your keys.
- My right hand pocket.

688
01:13:10,885 --> 01:13:12,053
Open the door.

689
01:13:12,153 --> 01:13:14,155
All right, bring her around.

690
01:13:14,255 --> 01:13:15,523
Set her on the seat.

691
01:13:15,623 --> 01:13:17,792
Go around to the other side.
Pull her in head first.

692
01:13:17,892 --> 01:13:20,094
Will you hold her legs for me?

693
01:13:20,194 --> 01:13:22,194
I got it.

694
01:13:22,463 --> 01:13:23,231
Please...

695
01:13:23,331 --> 01:13:25,400
All right, all right, close it.
Close the door.

696
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:30,090
Emilio, you take the keys,
you drive, you know the way.

697
01:13:30,405 --> 01:13:32,430
Come on.

698
01:13:32,673 --> 01:13:33,474
I need to stay here.

699
01:13:33,574 --> 01:13:34,409
What?

700
01:13:34,509 --> 01:13:35,877
I'm fine, just go.

701
01:13:35,977 --> 01:13:38,867
We'll be quick, don't go anywhere.

702
01:14:53,988 --> 01:14:58,254
All right, Anna. I'm here.

703
01:14:58,826 --> 01:15:01,121
What do you want me to see?

704
01:15:47,441 --> 01:15:51,639
Mama.

705
01:16:38,726 --> 01:16:40,161
Bruja.

706
01:16:40,261 --> 01:16:41,462
Bruja.

707
01:16:41,562 --> 01:16:43,562
Bruja. Bruja.

708
01:17:00,281 --> 01:17:02,281
Paul?

709
01:17:05,853 --> 01:17:07,853
Paul, is that you?

710
01:17:56,671 --> 01:17:58,671
Anna?

711
01:18:01,342 --> 01:18:09,374
Anna...

712
01:18:13,220 --> 01:18:15,220
Please help me.

713
01:18:26,434 --> 01:18:28,766
No. No. No.

714
01:18:29,070 --> 01:18:30,605
No. No.

715
01:18:30,705 --> 01:18:32,705
No. No.

716
01:18:35,443 --> 01:18:39,971
No.

717
01:18:47,955 --> 01:18:50,014
Come on. Come on.

718
01:18:50,091 --> 01:18:53,219
Come on. Come on.

719
01:18:53,561 --> 01:18:56,197
What am I supposed to do. Please.

720
01:18:56,297 --> 01:18:57,832
Tell me.

721
01:18:57,932 --> 01:18:59,798
Your mother asked
me to save you,

722
01:18:59,898 --> 01:19:01,068
but I don't know how.

723
01:19:01,168 --> 01:19:05,758
What am I supposed to do?
I don't know what to do here.

724
01:19:10,344 --> 01:19:12,344
What?

725
01:19:13,814 --> 01:19:16,109
What do you want from me...

726
01:19:17,785 --> 01:19:19,785
...tell me.

727
01:19:22,923 --> 01:19:32,321
I believe you...
I see what you saw...

728
01:19:32,666 --> 01:19:36,397
I know what you went through.

729
01:19:42,176 --> 01:19:44,235
It was never your fault.

730
01:20:27,555 --> 01:20:29,555
How's Mrs. Martinez?

731
01:20:29,957 --> 01:20:31,957
She didn't make it.

732
01:21:03,390 --> 01:21:05,390
Thank you.

733
01:21:37,658 --> 01:21:39,953
Hey buddy, what's going on?

734
01:21:40,861 --> 01:21:43,631
Some high-speed chase down
the American side...

735
01:21:43,731 --> 01:21:46,867
...has the whole border shut down.
Nearly an hour now.

736
01:21:46,967 --> 01:21:49,436
Might as well make
yourself comfortable.

737
01:21:49,536 --> 01:21:51,936
Great. Thanks.

738
01:22:00,514 --> 01:22:02,514
How long was I out?

739
01:22:02,549 --> 01:22:04,549
Not very long.

740
01:22:05,352 --> 01:22:07,352
Oh, it's freezing.

741
01:22:09,890 --> 01:22:11,890
What's going on?

742
01:22:12,059 --> 01:22:13,327
There's some kind of...

743
01:22:13,427 --> 01:22:15,389
...chase on the other
side of the border,

744
01:22:15,489 --> 01:22:16,764
we could be here all night.

745
01:22:16,864 --> 01:22:18,864
Really?

746
01:22:19,466 --> 01:22:21,466
Wanna play a game?

747
01:22:42,723 --> 01:22:44,723
Mommy.

748
01:22:55,436 --> 01:22:58,439
All right, come on,
let's get back in the car.

749
01:22:58,539 --> 01:22:59,687
Come on, you're scaring
the little girl,

750
01:22:59,787 --> 01:23:00,007
let's go.

751
01:23:00,107 --> 01:23:02,107
Wait.

752
01:23:02,576 --> 01:23:04,111
Look at her,
you're scaring the Hell out of her.

753
01:23:04,211 --> 01:23:07,526
Let's get back in the car, now.
Come on.

754
01:23:08,582 --> 01:23:10,582
What?

755
01:23:14,321 --> 01:23:16,321
Oh God.

756
01:23:19,460 --> 01:23:21,460
Sydney.

757
01:23:23,430 --> 01:23:25,430
Sydney.

758
01:23:25,466 --> 01:23:27,466
Sydney.

759
01:23:32,806 --> 01:23:36,376
Sorry man, are you all
right? All right...

760
01:23:37,978 --> 01:23:40,581
I see the shadows.
They're everywhere.

761
01:23:40,681 --> 01:23:43,061
Excuse me. Excuse me please.

762
01:23:43,150 --> 01:23:43,918
Open up.

763
01:23:44,018 --> 01:23:45,152
Open up please.

764
01:23:45,252 --> 01:23:45,853
What is going on.

765
01:23:45,953 --> 01:23:47,988
There's going to be a accident,
we don't have a lot of time.

766
01:23:48,088 --> 01:23:50,728
Please, just let me
talk to the driver,

767
01:23:50,828 --> 01:23:52,828
okay.

768
01:24:07,241 --> 01:24:09,241
Oh my God.

769
01:24:18,052 --> 01:24:21,322
Don't you understand.
This is what she wanted me to see.

770
01:24:21,422 --> 01:24:24,658
Everything I dreamed wasn't from
Anna's life, it was from this...

771
01:24:24,758 --> 01:24:26,850
Right now. She let me see
that this was going...

772
01:24:26,950 --> 01:24:28,729
to happen, so I wouldn't
end up like her.

773
01:24:28,829 --> 01:24:31,719
She wants me to
save these people.

774
01:24:32,900 --> 01:24:34,635
That's what she wants me to do.

775
01:24:34,735 --> 01:24:38,645
You have to believe me.
You have to believe me.

776
01:24:53,720 --> 01:24:55,889
You need to get off this bus.

777
01:24:55,989 --> 01:24:58,964
Everyone needs to get off this bus.

778
01:24:59,393 --> 01:25:02,113
All of you. You can't stay here.

779
01:25:04,064 --> 01:25:06,433
Everyone has got to
get off this bus.

780
01:25:06,533 --> 01:25:08,002
You need to get off
this bus, right now.

781
01:25:08,102 --> 01:25:08,869
Is it like a terrorist thing?

782
01:25:08,969 --> 01:25:09,903
- Yes.
- Get up...

783
01:25:10,003 --> 01:25:10,904
That's exactly...
...what it is.

784
01:25:11,004 --> 01:25:12,106
There's a bomb on the bus.

785
01:25:12,206 --> 01:25:16,768
There's a bomb. Run. Move it.

786
01:25:18,378 --> 01:25:21,973
Run, come on, get out of the car.

787
01:25:22,249 --> 01:25:25,116
Come on, get out.

788
01:25:25,419 --> 01:25:28,115
In the car... Run. Go.

789
01:25:28,589 --> 01:25:35,188
Out of your car.

790
01:25:37,030 --> 01:25:39,157
Wait here, sweetie.

791
01:25:46,640 --> 01:25:47,641
Mom.

792
01:25:47,741 --> 01:25:49,176
Run. There's a bomb.

793
01:25:49,276 --> 01:25:51,506
Run, get out of your cars.

794
01:25:53,881 --> 01:25:56,050
Get those people out
of there right now.

795
01:25:56,150 --> 01:25:57,251
Get out of the car.

796
01:25:57,351 --> 01:26:00,666
Come on, you got to
get out of the car.

797
01:26:06,493 --> 01:26:08,493
Come on.

798
01:26:09,463 --> 01:26:11,624
Go, go, go.

799
01:26:15,302 --> 01:26:17,302
Help me. Mom.

800
01:26:17,638 --> 01:26:19,306
Hey. Hey. Hey. Are you all right?

801
01:26:19,406 --> 01:26:21,956
Get my daughter. She's inside.

802
01:26:25,312 --> 01:26:26,246
Open the door.

803
01:26:26,346 --> 01:26:28,346
How. Please.

804
01:26:28,782 --> 01:26:30,782
Help me.

805
01:26:33,687 --> 01:26:34,822
Help.

806
01:26:34,922 --> 01:26:36,922
- Paul.
- Help.

807
01:26:37,791 --> 01:26:40,375
Stand back, I'm going
to break the window.

808
01:26:40,475 --> 01:26:41,428
Close your eyes.

809
01:26:41,528 --> 01:26:43,528
Stand back.

810
01:26:43,597 --> 01:26:45,597
- Hurry.
- Stand back.

811
01:26:49,269 --> 01:26:51,269
Come here, honey.

812
01:26:53,373 --> 01:26:55,373
Paul, let's go

813
01:26:56,810 --> 01:26:59,244
Hurry up. Run.

814
01:26:59,646 --> 01:27:01,646
Come on. Run. Run. Ru

815
01:27:43,457 --> 01:27:45,457
You saved them Sydney.

816
01:27:46,093 --> 01:27:48,093
You saved them Sydney.

817
01:27:49,363 --> 01:27:51,363
You saved them...

818
01:27:59,906 --> 01:28:04,666
Some say, seeing is believing.
Now I know what they mean.

819
01:28:04,845 --> 01:28:07,609
Anna Christina tried
to prevent death.

820
01:28:07,709 --> 01:28:10,918
But she was ultimately
powerless to stop it.

821
01:28:11,018 --> 01:28:14,843
Anna and I shared both a blessing
and a curse.

822
01:28:28,969 --> 01:28:33,729
I know, now, I don't need eyes
to see what truly matters.

823
01:28:33,807 --> 01:28:36,381
The gift of Anna's
sight made me see...

824
01:28:36,481 --> 01:28:37,844
what I was afraid to.

825
01:28:37,944 --> 01:28:38,745
To use...

826
01:28:38,845 --> 01:28:40,796
...that vision to not
only save myself...

827
01:28:40,896 --> 01:28:41,481
and others...

01:28:41,581 --> 01:28:43,617
But to give Anna the peace...

829
01:28:43,717 --> 01:28:46,437
...that she never found in life.
