00:00:54,347 --> 00:00:55,655
Where are you?

2
00:00:58,123 --> 00:00:59,431
Oh, yeah.
All right, all right, later.

3
00:01:00,555 --> 00:01:01,765
You all right, Alisa?

4
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:03,423
You girls coming
to my party, yeah?

5
00:01:03,626 --> 00:01:05,054
It's gonna be wicked,
everyone's gonna be there.

6
00:01:10,377 --> 00:01:13,224
So, I was, like, Listen, yeah, brush
your teeth after you lick me out...

7
00:01:13,225 --> 00:01:14,888
don't try and kiss me,
you get me?

8
00:01:14,888 --> 00:01:16,775
- That's proper grimy.
- I know, proper ghetto.

9
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,006
Moony's buff, you know.

10
00:01:19,784 --> 00:01:22,434
- Have you got a spare cigarette?
- No, I'm giving up.

11
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,922
Shaneek and Carleen are over there.
They're watching us.

12
00:01:26,055 --> 00:01:28,159
Did you finish the coursework
for them?

13
00:01:28,294 --> 00:01:29,373
No.

14
00:01:29,638 --> 00:01:30,914
Katie!

15
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,884
You girls gotta come to my party.
It's gonna be heavy.

16
00:01:35,045 --> 00:01:37,248
- Who's gonna be there?
- Everyone's coming.

17
00:01:37,413 --> 00:01:39,900
Mum and dad are away,
so anything goes.

18
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:41,409
Anything.

19
00:01:41,892 --> 00:01:43,452
- Please come.
- Safe, yeah?

20
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,889
Hey, pussyhole,
seen Claire around?

21
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:56,759
You like this,
isn't it, Charlotte?

22
00:01:56,898 --> 00:01:59,548
Why you calling me that?
You know my name's Claire.

23
00:02:00,258 --> 00:02:03,770
So that if anyone else hears, they don't
think that you're, you know, Sam's girl.

24
00:02:04,737 --> 00:02:07,671
- You scared of him, Jay?
- Of Sam? No.

25
00:02:18,143 --> 00:02:20,215
All right, girls.
Wanna come to my party?

26
00:02:20,734 --> 00:02:23,603
Are you gonna come? Surely your mum
can low you, it's Friday night.

27
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:26,106
I don't know,
I'm not feeling too good.

28
00:02:26,301 --> 00:02:27,794
And I ain't got nothing to wear.

29
00:02:27,965 --> 00:02:31,229
Okay, if I score some money to get us
something to wear, will you come?

30
00:02:31,229 --> 00:02:33,716
- Where you gonna get that much money?
- Don't watch that.

31
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:36,881
What go on, bitch?

32
00:02:37,052 --> 00:02:38,644
- You seen Claire anywhere?
- No.

33
00:02:38,748 --> 00:02:40,635
- What?
- No.

34
00:02:41,403 --> 00:02:44,053
What the fuck you looking at,
you fat bitch? You know me?

35
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,223
Have you seen Claire?

36
00:02:46,874 --> 00:02:49,328
Can't we kick, man?
I'm not your fucking security guard.

37
00:03:17,174 --> 00:03:19,955
- Yes, Moony.
- Yo, Trife.

38
00:03:20,149 --> 00:03:22,482
- Where you been, man?
- I had a couple things to do, man.

39
00:03:22,773 --> 00:03:25,707
What's wrong with these batty holes,
man. Always fucking playing football.

40
00:03:25,941 --> 00:03:27,915
Come in the class,
stinking it up afterwards.

41
00:03:28,117 --> 00:03:29,905
Hey, just light the zoot, man.

42
00:03:31,828 --> 00:03:33,737
Come on, Becky.
Let's go.

43
00:03:36,691 --> 00:03:40,039
You know what? Them two girls
over there are fucking weird, blood.

44
00:03:40,243 --> 00:03:42,992
I know. What the fuck
she's looking at, man?

45
00:03:43,346 --> 00:03:44,938
How can you make her watch you
like that, blood?

46
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:46,858
See me now, if that was me,
I wouldn't have it.

47
00:03:47,058 --> 00:03:49,512
You should spark
in her fucking face.

48
00:03:49,713 --> 00:03:52,079
Yeah, you watch.
I'm gonna mash her up.

49
00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:54,575
- Hey, come on, let's go, Jay.
- All right, man.

50
00:03:55,601 --> 00:03:57,520
- Ring me tonight, yeah?
- Yeah, yeah, course I will.

51
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,218
- Come on.
- Yes, man, there...

52
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,137
- and that Claire's pussy is live, man.
- You're gonna be late.

53
00:04:01,551 --> 00:04:03,623
Let's get inside
before the second bell.

54
00:04:06,703 --> 00:04:07,782
Come on.

55
00:04:08,335 --> 00:04:10,156
Oi, Alisa's looking tit, boy.

56
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,593
Why you split up with her?

57
00:04:11,662 --> 00:04:13,571
I don't know, man.
I dashed it, isn't it?

58
00:04:13,838 --> 00:04:15,877
She just... I don't know.

59
00:04:16,077 --> 00:04:18,051
- Boy, you're a fool, Trife man.
- Hey, fuck off, man.

60
00:04:18,253 --> 00:04:20,521
You're brave, blood...
I would never leave that, man.

61
00:04:20,653 --> 00:04:24,198
- I'd fuck that everyday.
- Everyday, blood, standard.

62
00:04:24,396 --> 00:04:27,112
- What you talking about?
- Rub them titties all night, blood.

63
00:04:27,595 --> 00:04:30,758
What you uniform pussyholes know about
titties and pussy and all them thing?

64
00:04:30,955 --> 00:04:34,566
And what you doing chatting about Alisa?
I fucked that girl a few weeks ago, blood.

65
00:04:34,762 --> 00:04:36,932
Everyday for a week
when she's supposed to be your girl.

66
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,313
Think you're so bad, isn't it?

67
00:04:45,545 --> 00:04:48,741
What did I tell you before, huh?
When I call you, you must come.

68
00:04:50,664 --> 00:04:52,703
Beat her, Shaneek star.

69
00:04:53,671 --> 00:04:56,517
- What did I tell you your name was?
- Big bird.

70
00:04:57,927 --> 00:05:00,065
Leave me alone, please.

71
00:05:00,263 --> 00:05:01,440
Get up.

72
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:03,900
Fucked her hard, blood,
you understand me?

73
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,662
Bareback, no rubber smutting.
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?

74
00:05:05,893 --> 00:05:09,056
- What you gonna do, man?
- Leave us alone, blood, man.

75
00:05:09,285 --> 00:05:11,324
Who the fuck you talking to?
Hold this fool.

76
00:05:11,525 --> 00:05:13,051
Low it, man, low it,
low it, low it, man.

77
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,179
What you got for me, blood?

78
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,488
- Got nothing, blood, man.
- What you got for me?

79
00:05:15,716 --> 00:05:17,027
- Who you talking to?
- Got nothing man.

80
00:05:17,028 --> 00:05:18,653
- Don't answer me back, bruv.
- Got nothing, man.

81
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:20,542
Fuck you talking to, blood?

82
00:05:20,739 --> 00:05:23,127
- Yeah, Tribal two.
- Hi, that's my sister's, blood, man.

83
00:05:23,811 --> 00:05:25,337
Hey, leave him, blood.
Who told you to pick him up?

84
00:05:26,338 --> 00:05:27,679
What you doing?

85
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:32,506
No-one fucking likes you,
virgin fool.

86
00:05:33,313 --> 00:05:36,661
Didn't she tell you before?
Don't answer her back.

87
00:05:37,057 --> 00:05:39,260
So what are you?
Slag then?

88
00:05:39,553 --> 00:05:42,651
Go on, bitch,
tell everybody you're a virgin.

89
00:05:42,848 --> 00:05:44,058
What?

90
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:48,435
Pick up my ring
and tell everyone you're a virgin.

91
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,099
Pick it up, man!

92
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:54,549
Well?

93
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:56,796
I'm a virgin.

94
00:05:57,502 --> 00:06:00,061
You know what, blood. Hug him up like
the fucking batty hole you are.

95
00:06:00,062 --> 00:06:01,239
Hug him up, blood!

96
00:06:07,388 --> 00:06:08,948
Hey, what you doing, man?

97
00:06:09,436 --> 00:06:11,955
What, you can't fuck with mans
your own age? You gotta trouble us?

98
00:06:12,188 --> 00:06:13,649
Who the fuck you talking to?

99
00:06:13,851 --> 00:06:15,127
Hey, where you going, blood?
Where you going?

100
00:06:15,227 --> 00:06:16,339
Where you going?
Where?

101
00:06:20,858 --> 00:06:22,166
Fucking idiot.

102
00:06:26,938 --> 00:06:28,726
- Smack her up.
- Beat her up, Shaneek. Beat her!

103
00:06:31,161 --> 00:06:33,561
Look at her just fucking
sitting there. Fool.

104
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:36,757
Go on, fuck off
and clean your duty self up, man.

105
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:41,622
And none of you lot better say nothing
or else you'll get the same...

106
00:06:41,623 --> 00:06:43,597
as that bitch did
with her virgin self.

107
00:06:43,991 --> 00:06:45,135
She ain't no virgin.

108
00:06:45,623 --> 00:06:47,183
How the fuck would you know?

109
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,076
Because me and her fucked
the day I turned you down.

110
00:07:03,092 --> 00:07:06,157
- Is there gonna be girls there, though?
- Yeah, Jay, everyone's coming.

111
00:07:06,227 --> 00:07:08,114
Hey, don't be on no hype,
you know.

112
00:07:08,211 --> 00:07:09,192
Trife.

113
00:07:09,459 --> 00:07:11,634
- You reaching that?
- I don't know, man.

114
00:07:11,635 --> 00:07:12,530
- Hey, what are you...
- Billy.

115
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:14,290
- Go on.
- What, you out of here, yeah?

116
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:15,922
- Safe.
- Bless, man.

117
00:07:15,922 --> 00:07:18,310
Laters, Jay, man.
All right, Moon.

118
00:07:19,794 --> 00:07:21,070
Hey, hey, wait up, wait up.

119
00:07:25,905 --> 00:07:27,465
Don't say anything.
Hang on a minute.

120
00:07:28,912 --> 00:07:30,438
- You all right?
- Yeah.

121
00:07:31,408 --> 00:07:33,796
- Look, why aren't you speaking to me?
- I am, man.

122
00:07:33,936 --> 00:07:36,357
You ain't chatted to me in, like,
three weeks.

123
00:07:37,455 --> 00:07:39,112
I've been doing
better things, isn't?

124
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:41,829
- I need to speak to you about something.
- Come on, Alisa.

125
00:07:42,286 --> 00:07:43,234
Call me later, yeah?

126
00:08:10,954 --> 00:08:12,295
Listen, hear what, right.

127
00:08:12,586 --> 00:08:15,814
If you say anything to your fucking dad,
I'll kill you, you understand?

128
00:08:18,025 --> 00:08:20,926
I can make things so easy for you,
you know that?

129
00:08:27,975 --> 00:08:29,535
- Hi, poppet.
- Hey.

130
00:08:42,533 --> 00:08:44,354
Who's that boy you were with?

131
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,434
I thought maybe
it was the one from before.

132
00:08:46,629 --> 00:08:49,923
No, I fell.
He was helping me up.

133
00:08:50,212 --> 00:08:54,237
Oh, right. Only I saw him giving you
a peck on the cheek.

134
00:08:55,491 --> 00:08:57,563
- I thought maybe it was him.
- No.

135
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:01,630
How was biology?

136
00:09:03,106 --> 00:09:04,316
Katie?

137
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:07,416
Katie, what the hell's happened
to your face? Look at me.

138
00:09:07,617 --> 00:09:08,696
I fell.

139
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:12,437
You all right?

140
00:09:16,032 --> 00:09:18,006
Hello?
Yeah, I'm Dan Fineal.

141
00:09:19,295 --> 00:09:22,261
Yeah, Arthur. No, you were supposed
to be there two hours ago, mate.

142
00:09:26,655 --> 00:09:27,669
Trevor.

143
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,037
Get in.

144
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:39,606
School finish at four.
Why you take so long?

145
00:09:39,869 --> 00:09:41,526
I had to chat to one girl,
isn't it?

146
00:09:42,236 --> 00:09:44,886
This here is Andreas.

147
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,203
Nice to meet you, bruv.

148
00:09:46,204 --> 00:09:49,367
- This is my nephew Trevor.
- Trife.

149
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,046
You have the thing?

150
00:10:04,505 --> 00:10:05,519
You see...

151
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:08,917
if you don't drill
the replica good...

152
00:10:09,272 --> 00:10:12,206
the bullet won't leave and pop!

153
00:10:14,167 --> 00:10:15,443
Is it okay?

154
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:19,181
The last boy used to do this
for me, was shit.

155
00:10:20,183 --> 00:10:22,157
Guns always used to blow up.

156
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,527
But this looks good.

157
00:10:24,726 --> 00:10:26,929
But I will have to test it.
Saying?

158
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:31,988
So, listen, come see me
when you finish school tomorrow...

159
00:10:31,988 --> 00:10:34,158
and we can discuss business,
all right?

160
00:10:34,324 --> 00:10:35,600
- Cool.
- Yeah.

161
00:10:37,876 --> 00:10:39,436
Now get out.

162
00:10:44,979 --> 00:10:47,531
Me just a joke with you.

163
00:10:47,762 --> 00:10:49,103
Me see you tomorrow, yeah?

164
00:10:49,426 --> 00:10:51,564
- Don't be late, you know.
- I won't, I won't.

165
00:10:52,945 --> 00:10:54,984
- Later.
- All right, Trevor.

166
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:57,198
My little gun driller.

167
00:10:59,376 --> 00:11:00,652
Hi, Katie.

168
00:11:03,088 --> 00:11:04,516
- Hi, love.
- Hi.

169
00:11:07,055 --> 00:11:09,443
- Is she okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, she's fine.

170
00:11:09,743 --> 00:11:11,749
Oh, that.
She fell over at school.

171
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:14,126
Christ, Arthur's really fucked up
my day.

172
00:11:21,165 --> 00:11:22,593
Under the seat.

173
00:11:38,762 --> 00:11:39,841
Oh, shit.

174
00:11:40,554 --> 00:11:44,263
Curtis, I've forgotten the change, man.
I've left it back at my place.

175
00:11:45,354 --> 00:11:47,458
I'm really sorry. I'll bring it round
to yours later, yeah?

176
00:11:49,929 --> 00:11:53,540
Fuck it, I fuck, I fucked up. Look,
take it back, we'll sort it out tomorrow.

177
00:11:54,248 --> 00:11:56,451
Cool. Cool.

178
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:58,692
You sure?

179
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:00,320
Go on.

180
00:12:01,544 --> 00:12:02,885
Cool. Cheers, man.

181
00:12:07,847 --> 00:12:10,334
- See you tomorrow.
- Cool, man. Cheers.

182
00:12:12,421 --> 00:12:14,180
I think she's being bullied
at school.

183
00:12:14,181 --> 00:12:16,351
- Did she say that?
- No. But...

184
00:12:16,453 --> 00:12:18,340
Well, don't worry about it.
She's a bright kid, she'd tell us.

185
00:12:18,532 --> 00:12:19,709
Have you seen
my address book anywhere?

186
00:12:19,844 --> 00:12:21,632
Don't worry about it?
What sort of thing is that to say?

187
00:12:21,828 --> 00:12:23,867
Aren't you worried about
your own daughter?

188
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,052
Have you asked her?

189
00:12:27,235 --> 00:12:28,925
There you go.
She's fine.

190
00:14:15,155 --> 00:14:17,522
Lenny, could you get your sister
to turn that shit off, please.

191
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,653
- It's been playing for ages.
- Doesn't bother me.

192
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:22,637
Fine.

193
00:14:22,802 --> 00:14:24,711
Katie! Katie!

194
00:14:25,362 --> 00:14:27,728
Katie! Katie!

195
00:14:29,265 --> 00:14:30,344
Kat¡e!

196
00:14:48,303 --> 00:14:51,918
We are number one for h¡p-hop
and ¡n London.

197
00:14:51,918 --> 00:14:57,284
And around the country, Sky D¡g¡tal,
Telewest and D¡g¡tal DAB Rad¡o.

198
00:14:57,549 --> 00:15:01,672
B¡lly-Bob Thornton,
Angel¡na Jol¡e's ex-husband...

199
00:15:01,868 --> 00:15:05,347
has sa¡d that she's not
that good ¡n bed.

200
00:15:05,547 --> 00:15:07,040
Hey, mum, I got it, yeah.

201
00:15:09,324 --> 00:15:11,876
- What go on, coz?
- Yes, blood.

202
00:15:12,075 --> 00:15:14,376
- What's happening, man?
- Like the trim still, man.

203
00:15:14,571 --> 00:15:17,570
- Hey, what you want, though?
- Hey, come say hello to my mum, blood.

204
00:15:18,506 --> 00:15:20,839
- Morning, Jason.
- Morning, Mrs. Hector.

205
00:15:21,034 --> 00:15:24,830
I hope you two boys use this day
to remember that poor girl...

206
00:15:25,065 --> 00:15:26,974
and not for foolishness.

207
00:15:27,753 --> 00:15:29,214
- Yes, mum.
- Course, Mrs. Hector.

208
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:30,659
Go on.

209
00:15:32,808 --> 00:15:34,433
That's right, blood,
do what your mum says.

210
00:15:34,503 --> 00:15:36,063
Shut up, man.

211
00:15:36,487 --> 00:15:39,072
Yeah, blood...
school called here this morning.

212
00:15:40,102 --> 00:15:42,654
Told my mum the whole year
had the day off.

213
00:15:43,942 --> 00:15:46,243
- This is proper sad, man.
- I know, man.

214
00:15:46,502 --> 00:15:49,501
I was just about to leave my yard,
like had my uniform on and everything.

215
00:15:49,733 --> 00:15:52,579
Listen, blood, Sam and them girls
always picking on her.

216
00:15:52,836 --> 00:15:54,628
Yeah, but Sam
troubles us too, blood...

217
00:15:54,629 --> 00:15:56,603
and we ain't committing suicide
over it, are we?

218
00:15:57,124 --> 00:15:59,327
If anyone should fucking die,
it's him man.

219
00:15:59,524 --> 00:16:02,109
Can't believe someone
I pressed is dead.

220
00:16:02,307 --> 00:16:03,419
So why didn't you tell me
then, man?

221
00:16:03,523 --> 00:16:05,464
She asked me
not to say nothing, isn't it.

222
00:16:05,571 --> 00:16:07,392
Thought people would call her
sket and thing.

223
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:10,202
Plus her dad caught us...
Hey, you got a zoot?

224
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:13,598
No, I got a roll up, though.
Jacked it off my mum.

225
00:16:14,178 --> 00:16:15,519
Spark that, man.

226
00:16:23,136 --> 00:16:24,412
Blood, weird thing is, though...

227
00:16:25,311 --> 00:16:27,350
her dad came by late last night.

228
00:16:28,063 --> 00:16:30,233
That's how I found out
she was dead.

229
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:34,587
In her suicide note, she said
something about Sam troubling her.

230
00:16:35,326 --> 00:16:37,398
- But I was always nice to her.
- A note?

231
00:16:39,101 --> 00:16:40,245
Well, did she mention me?

232
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:44,060
I never see you chat to her
anyway, man.

233
00:16:44,061 --> 00:16:45,467
Blood, don't watch
what I do, man.

234
00:16:45,533 --> 00:16:47,605
You ain't always with me, and
you never knew I pressed her either.

235
00:16:47,804 --> 00:16:50,779
You come like some secret agent
or something, man.

236
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,208
Let me have two draw
of that, man.

237
00:16:52,795 --> 00:16:55,347
Hey, listen bell Moony.
I wanna duck out quick.

238
00:16:56,475 --> 00:16:57,816
The whole day?

239
00:16:59,387 --> 00:17:00,815
Don't lie, blood.

240
00:17:01,723 --> 00:17:04,439
Yeah, I'll have
to take a cab still.

241
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:07,224
Moons, just hurry up though, man.
All right, bless.

242
00:17:09,881 --> 00:17:11,920
- Hey, blood, you see Katie, yeah?
- Yeah.

243
00:17:12,633 --> 00:17:14,574
Do you reckon
she would have banged me, like?

244
00:17:14,776 --> 00:17:15,986
No, man.

245
00:17:16,216 --> 00:17:17,622
Why not?

246
00:17:18,392 --> 00:17:19,383
I think I'm buff.

247
00:17:19,384 --> 00:17:21,936
Blood, I beg you,
play the fucking game, man.

248
00:17:26,423 --> 00:17:27,633
Oh, fuck's sake.

249
00:17:32,661 --> 00:17:33,675
Hello?

250
00:17:34,133 --> 00:17:36,139
- Yeah, who's that?
- It's me.

251
00:17:37,237 --> 00:17:38,829
You didn't call me.

252
00:17:39,316 --> 00:17:41,770
Did you hear?
Sad, isn't it?

253
00:17:43,348 --> 00:17:46,576
- Look, what are you doing today?
- Gonna jam with Moons and Jay.

254
00:17:47,219 --> 00:17:51,047
Might go up West End later.
Gotta check my uncle, why?

255
00:17:52,115 --> 00:17:54,929
- No, just tell me now, man.
- I'd rather see you.

256
00:17:55,218 --> 00:17:57,224
You don't need to see me,
you ain't my girl no more. What is it?

257
00:18:00,689 --> 00:18:02,097
What the fuck do you mean
you're pregnant?

258
00:18:02,098 --> 00:18:03,473
Oh, my days!

259
00:18:03,473 --> 00:18:05,414
You can't be fucking pregnant. I thought
you'd get the morning after pill?

260
00:18:05,648 --> 00:18:07,851
It's not just up
to the girls, you know.

261
00:18:09,584 --> 00:18:10,827
Yeah, of course I'm sure.

262
00:18:12,496 --> 00:18:14,437
I've been taking tests all week.

263
00:18:15,855 --> 00:18:17,065
Look...

264
00:18:18,351 --> 00:18:19,495
I want us to get back together.

265
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:22,342
Later, fuck that.
After you fucked Sam a few weeks ago?

266
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:24,680
Yeah, he told me he bare backed you.
That's even worse man.

267
00:18:24,845 --> 00:18:26,732
- You never knew I knew that, did you?
- But we do know!

268
00:18:26,957 --> 00:18:28,385
Hey, and don't bother trying
to explain, man.

269
00:18:28,461 --> 00:18:30,315
You know what,
for all I know the baby's his.

270
00:18:30,444 --> 00:18:32,298
Fact now that I think of it,
I know it is, and you know it too.

271
00:18:32,493 --> 00:18:34,402
Yeah, blood, she's loose, man.
Cut her off, man.

272
00:18:34,636 --> 00:18:36,839
What?
I slept with Katie last year.

273
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,307
Me and you weren't even together,
so fuck off!

274
00:18:39,308 --> 00:18:41,990
Standard, blood. You get me. I told you
about that girl, man, she's a sket.

275
00:18:43,659 --> 00:18:46,528
Pregnant, though.
It's a bit deep, still.

276
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:50,373
- So what you gonna do?
- I don't know, man.

277
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:52,063
Fuck it, it can't be mine.

278
00:18:53,162 --> 00:18:54,983
I just don't need
this shit today.

279
00:18:55,369 --> 00:18:58,150
So what, can man's come
and reach your uncle with you, blood?

280
00:18:59,529 --> 00:19:02,211
No, I think he wants
to see me alone, still.

281
00:19:04,008 --> 00:19:05,436
So, what did he say?

282
00:19:06,088 --> 00:19:07,745
He said he's going out.

283
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:10,885
And that fucking Sam told him
we slept together.

284
00:19:11,143 --> 00:19:12,703
So why didn't you tell him
what happened?

285
00:19:12,774 --> 00:19:14,431
He didn't give me
a fucking chance.

286
00:19:15,494 --> 00:19:18,079
You know what, yeah,
fuck him and this fucking baby.

287
00:19:20,294 --> 00:19:22,148
- All right, girls?
- Mum, don't you knock?

288
00:19:22,341 --> 00:19:23,769
Oi, none of your lip.

289
00:19:24,165 --> 00:19:26,750
I know you're upset,
but that's no reason to be cheeky.

290
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:29,052
- Do you want a drink, Becky?
- No, thanks.

291
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:31,520
Right, I'm off to work.
Lis, I want you back by midnight.

292
00:19:31,716 --> 00:19:33,603
- Oh, mum!
- One, then, on the dot.

293
00:19:33,859 --> 00:19:35,842
And if you think you can't get back here
call your dad and he'll pick you up.

294
00:19:35,843 --> 00:19:38,013
- All right?
- Okay.

295
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:39,897
Alis...

296
00:19:42,946 --> 00:19:45,880
I know you're upset, but there's
nothing you could have done.

297
00:19:46,241 --> 00:19:48,379
Now, I'm sad for
that other girl's parents...

298
00:19:49,505 --> 00:19:52,090
but all that really matters
is that you're all right.

299
00:19:52,288 --> 00:19:54,043
Are you all right?

300
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:56,637
I'm...

301
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:01,398
I'm fine.

302
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,308
Good.
See you later, darling.

303
00:20:06,111 --> 00:20:07,866
- I love you, Lis.
- Love you.

304
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:12,564
Yo, D. Guess what, man,
I got the day off school.

305
00:20:12,766 --> 00:20:14,805
And I'm going to that party
tonight as well.

306
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:17,724
Yeah, I know.
Your school belled a while ago.

307
00:20:17,981 --> 00:20:19,125
Hi, Lenny.

308
00:20:20,061 --> 00:20:22,133
I'm sorry about your sister, bro.

309
00:20:22,876 --> 00:20:24,763
Tell your mate Trevor
I said thank you.

310
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:27,697
See you.

311
00:20:28,731 --> 00:20:30,486
So, you gonna help me or what?

312
00:20:32,795 --> 00:20:33,688
Yeah.

313
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:38,096
I still can't believe
Katie killed herself.

314
00:20:39,577 --> 00:20:41,332
So, what do you wanna do?

315
00:20:42,425 --> 00:20:43,766
You know what...

316
00:20:44,025 --> 00:20:45,551
I wanna get fucked up.

317
00:20:45,753 --> 00:20:47,923
I wanna go shopping for tonight,
that'll make me feel better.

318
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,508
And if Trife don't want me,
I'm sure someone else will.

319
00:20:50,712 --> 00:20:52,566
I meant about the baby.

320
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:54,263
Lose it, if I'm lucky.

321
00:20:54,264 --> 00:20:56,342
Well, at least
you're thinking straight.

322
00:20:56,343 --> 00:20:58,166
We've got the whole day off,
we might as well do something...

323
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:59,766
constructive with ourselves.

324
00:20:59,767 --> 00:21:01,806
I know where we can score
some wicked draw.

325
00:21:04,277 --> 00:21:06,415
I'd get so fat if I kept this.

326
00:21:08,949 --> 00:21:10,061
Taxi!

327
00:21:11,444 --> 00:21:12,425
What the fuck, man?

328
00:21:21,715 --> 00:21:23,885
What's fucking taking him
so long, man?

329
00:21:27,474 --> 00:21:28,455
Taxi!

330
00:21:28,722 --> 00:21:30,183
Fuck off!

331
00:21:30,641 --> 00:21:31,917
Fucking hell, man!

332
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:33,323
Come on.

333
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:36,073
Fuck, man.

334
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,470
Look at this girl's pussy. Looks like
her guts are hanging out and shit.

335
00:21:43,471 --> 00:21:46,950
Man, that's nasty, man.
I hate that shit, ugly pussy.

336
00:21:47,215 --> 00:21:49,353
- Still poke it, though.
- No, that's not for me, star.

337
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:52,102
I won't fuck no girl, yeah,
unless she's got a DV?

338
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:53,673
DV?

339
00:21:53,967 --> 00:21:56,846
Designer vagina, man.
Neat tucked in lips and shit.

340
00:21:56,846 --> 00:21:58,023
It's the way forward, blood.

341
00:21:59,085 --> 00:22:01,189
So, who's this guy again?

342
00:22:01,581 --> 00:22:04,780
Rupert. I met him at some rave.
He gives me weed and shit for free.

343
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:06,406
Is it? Safe.

344
00:22:13,835 --> 00:22:15,143
Finally.

345
00:22:16,683 --> 00:22:17,730
Let's roll, man.

346
00:22:19,979 --> 00:22:22,117
Yes, Jay, what's cooking, bruv?

347
00:22:22,346 --> 00:22:24,865
- Yeah, like the trim, rude boy.
- Bye, mum.

348
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:29,703
- What took you so fucking long, man?
- There weren't no cabs, isn't it.

349
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,039
I've been hav¡ng a good week, actually.
Come on ¡n.

350
00:22:40,423 --> 00:22:43,389
So, Rebecca,
who's your lovely friend?

351
00:22:43,655 --> 00:22:46,524
- I'm Alisa.
- Alisa? What a pretty name.

352
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:48,806
Ladies, this is my friend
Hamish.

353
00:22:49,286 --> 00:22:50,049
Hi.

354
00:22:50,214 --> 00:22:53,529
Go and take a seat on the sofa, take
your coats off, make yourselves at home.

355
00:22:57,221 --> 00:22:58,431
How much do you want this time?

356
00:22:58,725 --> 00:23:01,626
- As much as you wanna give.
- Not a problem.

357
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:06,430
But I want some E's today
and maybe some coke.

358
00:23:06,755 --> 00:23:09,983
The weed I can do for free, but,
coke and E's is gonna cost.

359
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:15,003
I haven't got no money on me.

360
00:23:16,162 --> 00:23:18,049
Who needs money?

361
00:23:37,471 --> 00:23:40,405
- Get your knickers off then.
- In your fucking dreams.

362
00:23:40,798 --> 00:23:43,164
- What, you're not gonna let me fuck you?
- No.

363
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:46,491
- What about a blow-job then?
- Fuck off.

364
00:23:46,686 --> 00:23:49,336
- Wank?
- Keep talking and you'll get a smack.

365
00:23:49,853 --> 00:23:52,023
Oh, come on, Al,
we'll make dollars when we sell it.

366
00:23:52,221 --> 00:23:53,365
Do you wanna shop or what?

367
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:56,441
- Yeah, but...
- Stop being such a boring bitch then.

368
00:24:00,635 --> 00:24:02,773
But I'm not gonna suck it, okay?

369
00:24:11,322 --> 00:24:12,728
What is that?

370
00:24:21,112 --> 00:24:23,500
- How old are you?
- I'm old enough, blood.

371
00:24:23,736 --> 00:24:25,775
"Blood", you're too young
to buy these beers.

372
00:24:26,007 --> 00:24:29,006
- What? Oh, shut up, man.
- Oi, come back.

373
00:24:29,815 --> 00:24:32,684
- Come back!
- Come back or what, man? Shut your mouth.

374
00:24:33,494 --> 00:24:35,468
- I'll have you arrested!
- You ain't gonna do shit, man.

375
00:24:35,606 --> 00:24:36,565
- Get out of my shop.
- What?

376
00:24:36,566 --> 00:24:38,549
- You're banned!
- Man, I'll leave when I wanna leave, man.

377
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:39,694
What? Come.

378
00:24:40,309 --> 00:24:42,545
- Dickhead.
- Fuck off.

379
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:45,487
Bastard!

380
00:24:46,804 --> 00:24:49,902
I ain't fucking with her no more, man,
after she got banged by Sam.

381
00:24:50,164 --> 00:24:52,552
Fuck that, you get me?
She's any girl to me now. Fuck her.

382
00:24:52,756 --> 00:24:56,203
Bloods, I wouldn't care whose baby
it is, yeah, but I'd still bang that.

383
00:24:58,322 --> 00:24:59,730
Hey, bloods, where's yours?

384
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:01,490
Had to dash it at that guy,
isn't it, man.

385
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:03,180
- He was shook, though.
- You're a bad man.

386
00:25:03,377 --> 00:25:04,456
Let's dust, man.

387
00:25:04,626 --> 00:25:06,349
I ain't standing on the corner like
a fucking rent boy all day.

388
00:25:06,609 --> 00:25:09,161
- So what, which way are we going, bruv?
- Let's roll this way, isn't it.

389
00:25:13,296 --> 00:25:15,815
What's wrong, man?
What are you looking at?

390
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,926
Sam lives over there.

391
00:25:19,376 --> 00:25:21,895
- You wanna get your GameBoy back?
- Yeah.

392
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:25,838
Yeah that, I'm on that, man,
let's do it. Come, come.

393
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:27,693
Let's not be stupid, man.

394
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:32,491
- So, what are we gonna do?
- Sam's gonna be at school, blood, yeah?

395
00:25:32,685 --> 00:25:34,029
Only our year's got the day off.

396
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,181
We'll just go up there,
say we're his friends...

397
00:25:35,181 --> 00:25:36,972
and we're picking it up,
isn't it? Simple.

398
00:25:36,972 --> 00:25:40,011
Or, we ding the bell,
get through the main door...

399
00:25:40,012 --> 00:25:41,675
and boot down his fucking
front door, isn't it.

400
00:25:41,676 --> 00:25:44,140
No, man.
That's some police shit.

401
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:45,579
Look, blood, there's three
of us alie...

402
00:25:45,579 --> 00:25:47,912
we'll just go up there, yeah,
ask for it back.

403
00:25:48,076 --> 00:25:50,246
And if he's gets brave, blood, we'll
handle it at school together, isn't it.

404
00:25:50,379 --> 00:25:51,840
- Standard, let's roll.
- But he rolls deep, man!

405
00:25:52,107 --> 00:25:54,245
- Hey, fuck it, man, let's do it.
- Oh, shit.

406
00:26:03,817 --> 00:26:06,336
What the fuck is he doing at home,
man? He's gonna kill us.

407
00:26:06,536 --> 00:26:09,252
- Hey, don't worry, man, he's gone.
- What if he comes back, though, like?

408
00:26:09,448 --> 00:26:10,974
He won't, man. What's wrong with you?
What you scared for, man?

409
00:26:11,112 --> 00:26:13,021
I'm not, man.
I think we should just duck, man.

410
00:26:13,224 --> 00:26:15,078
- Just shut up, man, you're scared.
- I'm not.

411
00:26:17,959 --> 00:26:19,452
- Hello.
- Hi.

412
00:26:19,847 --> 00:26:22,716
We're Sam's friends. We've just come
here to pick something up.

413
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:25,884
Sam's not here.
He's just gone to the shop for me.

414
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:28,670
Yeah, we saw him downstairs, he told
us to come up and wait for him.

415
00:26:28,869 --> 00:26:30,461
He just left, right?

416
00:26:37,476 --> 00:26:39,002
Hey, that must be his room.

417
00:26:43,299 --> 00:26:45,818
- That's where your GameBoy is.
- Is that my GameBoy, bloods?

418
00:26:47,458 --> 00:26:48,864
Oh shit, shit, oh shit.

419
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:50,747
What if he comes back now?

420
00:26:50,946 --> 00:26:52,352
What the fuck
are you lot doing here?

421
00:26:52,578 --> 00:26:55,163
Sam jacked my sister's GameBoy,
yeah, I'm just here to take it back.

422
00:26:55,361 --> 00:26:57,531
- Hold this boy.
- Hey, Moons, hold him. Hold him, man.

423
00:26:57,793 --> 00:27:00,126
He told me he bought that,
he's such an arsehole.

424
00:27:00,513 --> 00:27:01,504
Yo, what's out there?

425
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:03,674
Balcony, where he stashes
his weed and shit.

426
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,723
Come and take this boy
outside, man.

427
00:27:05,951 --> 00:27:07,357
If he's such an arsehole,
why are you with him?

428
00:27:07,583 --> 00:27:10,332
I don't know, he's older,
more mature.

429
00:27:11,007 --> 00:27:12,533
Then why you cheat him?

430
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:16,445
- Blood, you can't take his weed, man.
- Fuck that, man.

431
00:27:16,446 --> 00:27:18,616
- Hey, Jay, man, we got him.
- Just give me one minute, man.

432
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,749
I don't even know
why you're with that boy, man.

433
00:27:22,749 --> 00:27:24,821
Look...
you could be my girlfriend.

434
00:27:25,565 --> 00:27:29,426
It's just, he sa¡d ¡f I leave h¡m,
he'll tell everyone I was a sh¡t fuck.

435
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:33,332
No, no, I know you're not shit,
I bet you're cold in bed, man.

436
00:27:33,531 --> 00:27:34,643
I don't know...

437
00:27:34,843 --> 00:27:37,274
He says I'm not that good
and I've only slept with him, so...

438
00:27:37,275 --> 00:27:38,811
Yeah, well, let me be the judge
of that then, isn't it.

439
00:27:38,811 --> 00:27:39,792
What?

440
00:27:40,314 --> 00:27:43,662
- What, has he got any rubbers in here?
- Yeah, in that drawer. Why?

441
00:27:43,929 --> 00:27:46,895
Not now, Jay, man, his mum said
he only went down the road.

442
00:27:50,744 --> 00:27:53,645
- Maybe you lot should go.
- You know what, don't watch that, man.

443
00:28:03,095 --> 00:28:05,396
Oh, no, no, no, low it, man.

444
00:28:07,255 --> 00:28:08,945
- I'm sorry, yeah, this don't normally...
- It's okay.

445
00:28:09,142 --> 00:28:12,437
It's because you're so buff,
yeah, and like you're good, man.

446
00:28:12,437 --> 00:28:16,788
In fact, yeah, you should leave
that pussyhole and be my girlfriend.

447
00:28:16,789 --> 00:28:19,891
- What do you think, yeah?
- What if he beats me up or something?

448
00:28:19,892 --> 00:28:21,615
No, he ain't gonna do that.
Look, you know what, darling.

449
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,819
- Come with me. Come.
- Are you done?

450
00:28:24,532 --> 00:28:26,189
- One minute.
- You fucking know about it.

451
00:28:27,283 --> 00:28:29,331
You let the side down!

452
00:28:29,331 --> 00:28:31,346
What's up, man? You don't even know
about sex live, man.

453
00:28:31,347 --> 00:28:33,550
What the fuck you lot doing
in my yard?

454
00:28:34,866 --> 00:28:37,385
Look, blood, you took
my GameBoy, man, I just...

455
00:28:37,585 --> 00:28:40,486
Are you dizzy, blood? You're gonna
come up here like you're bad.

456
00:28:40,689 --> 00:28:42,695
You see, yeah,
I'm gonna fuck you up, blood.

457
00:28:42,897 --> 00:28:46,311
And you, see, you, Claire, I'm gonna
shove this bat so far up your pussy...

458
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,748
Shit.

459
00:28:48,016 --> 00:28:49,739
Hey, fuck you, you fucking prick.

460
00:28:50,032 --> 00:28:52,235
- Fucking idiot!
- Hold on, hold on, man.

461
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,672
Oh, shit!

462
00:28:59,118 --> 00:29:00,775
Come on, lets go.

463
00:29:03,949 --> 00:29:05,323
Run, blood!

464
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:29,955
I can't believe
what you lot just done.

465
00:29:30,154 --> 00:29:31,560
Hey, fuck him, man,
he deserved it.

466
00:29:31,658 --> 00:29:33,926
Hey, you know
he fucked Alisa, isn't it?

467
00:29:34,154 --> 00:29:35,298
No, I didn't.

468
00:29:36,073 --> 00:29:37,512
Sam's gonna kill me.

469
00:29:37,513 --> 00:29:39,334
He ain't gonna do shit to you, man.
You know why?

470
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:40,956
Because you're my girl now,
you get me?

471
00:29:41,225 --> 00:29:43,428
Yeah, man, let him come, man.
You see my uncle I'm checking today?

472
00:29:43,655 --> 00:29:46,621
He's a proper bad man. And if Sam
thinks about doing anything...

473
00:29:46,887 --> 00:29:48,413
my uncle will murk him
on the spot, standard.

474
00:29:48,615 --> 00:29:50,753
You keep talking about your uncle
that's gonna do this and that, yeah?

475
00:29:50,982 --> 00:29:52,356
But we ain't even met him, man.
I mean, what...

476
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:54,021
are you sure my man
even exists, like?

477
00:29:54,022 --> 00:29:55,749
He comes like the invisible man
or something, blood.

478
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,854
- Yeah. Hollow Man, rude boy.
- I'll slap you, you know that, Moons?

479
00:29:58,117 --> 00:30:00,353
Just wait till we need him
and he'll be here.

480
00:30:00,613 --> 00:30:03,263
If he's there, I'm there. I'll jook
some up, blood. I don't business.

481
00:30:03,493 --> 00:30:05,183
Shut up, Moons man,
you ain't gonna do shit, man.

482
00:30:06,981 --> 00:30:09,444
I can't believe you swallowed
that guy's spunk.

483
00:30:09,444 --> 00:30:12,259
I hate it, it tastes like
salty egg whites.

484
00:30:12,259 --> 00:30:14,429
Yuk, but what
if he's got something?

485
00:30:14,691 --> 00:30:17,794
You can't catch nothing like that.
All the acids in your stomach kill it.

486
00:30:17,795 --> 00:30:20,031
- Did you like wanking that guy?
- No.

487
00:30:20,258 --> 00:30:21,719
Was you wet?

488
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:23,992
- Yeah, a little bit.
- A little bit?

489
00:30:24,194 --> 00:30:27,390
- Yeah, but his thing's so small, man.
- I bet you was mad wet, I was.

490
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:29,217
Well then, why didn't you
just fuck that Rupert friend...

491
00:30:29,217 --> 00:30:30,427
and I wouldn't have had
to wank him.

492
00:30:30,657 --> 00:30:33,820
You just said you liked it.
Anyway only my man gets the pussy.

493
00:30:34,017 --> 00:30:36,121
Unlike you, obviously.
You sure you know whose baby it is?

494
00:30:36,191 --> 00:30:38,492
- Don't try it, Becky.
- Yeah, well, I couldn't have that in me.

495
00:30:38,687 --> 00:30:40,791
If I was you, I'd want to rip it out
with a coat-hanger.

496
00:31:17,369 --> 00:31:19,888
- Fucking hell, man!
- What, blood?

497
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:22,457
Didn't I tell them no onions?

498
00:31:22,457 --> 00:31:24,398
Yeah, you did, man,
you did say no onions, blood, man.

499
00:31:28,632 --> 00:31:30,455
Didn't I say no onions?

500
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:31,567
Fool.

501
00:31:51,861 --> 00:31:54,420
- Oi, what's going on?
- We got money, relax yourself.

502
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,881
Drive, man.

503
00:31:56,116 --> 00:31:57,676
So, what, are me and you on
or what now?

504
00:31:57,908 --> 00:32:00,395
- Yeah, yeah, I'm your girl.
- Yeah?

505
00:32:01,715 --> 00:32:02,991
Yeah.
Come here.

506
00:32:06,099 --> 00:32:08,882
Well, I gotta go home.
I'll see you tonight, yeah?

507
00:32:08,882 --> 00:32:10,670
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
all right, take care, yeah.

508
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:37,644
Coke head baby.

509
00:32:38,861 --> 00:32:41,132
Whatever, man,
it'll be gone soon.

510
00:32:41,133 --> 00:32:43,020
God, I ain't changing
no fucking nappies for it.

511
00:32:44,108 --> 00:32:46,344
Look, yeah, there's an abortion clinic
number here, do you wanna bell it?

512
00:32:46,573 --> 00:32:49,703
Not now, man. Not today.
Look, can I use your toilet?

513
00:32:49,836 --> 00:32:51,690
Are you gonna do a shit?
Because if you are, then, no.

514
00:32:51,916 --> 00:32:54,152
That's loose, man, I don't do that
in other people's houses.

515
00:32:54,379 --> 00:32:57,225
Well, hurry up, we need to get
the money for the garms.

516
00:33:39,748 --> 00:33:41,820
Yeah, she's banged up, babes.
Yeah.

517
00:33:43,267 --> 00:33:44,695
All right, see you soon.

518
00:33:46,467 --> 00:33:48,539
- Who was that?
- My man.

519
00:33:53,922 --> 00:33:56,604
- Listen, lads, where you off to?
- Oxford Street, man.

520
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:58,775
Well, why don't you walk?
It's only down the road.

521
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:00,193
Because we wanted
to catch a cab, man.

522
00:34:00,193 --> 00:34:02,014
Why don't you shut your mouth
and mind your own business, blood?

523
00:34:02,209 --> 00:34:04,347
Well, to be honest might have
to drop you off at Marble Arch...

524
00:34:04,577 --> 00:34:07,925
- because the traffic's...
- What's wrong with you?

525
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:10,589
Yeah, man, yeah, Tr¡fe
and them two l¡ttle pussyholes.

526
00:34:11,744 --> 00:34:14,045
Yeah, man, yeah. No, no, don't reach,
don't reach, I'm cool, yeah.

527
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,158
Listen I swear down, blood,
if I see them before you see...

528
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,533
I'm gonna bang them up.
I'm gonna bang them up.

529
00:34:17,759 --> 00:34:19,668
I'm gonna bust their heads,
do you understand me?

530
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:22,422
Listen, if you eye them, yeah if you
see them, you just ding me, yeah.

531
00:34:33,725 --> 00:34:36,732
- Can we go and get something to eat?
- No, I don't wanna look fat for Mark.

532
00:34:36,732 --> 00:34:39,698
- But I'm starving, though.
- We'll get a pizza when we get to his.

533
00:34:52,666 --> 00:34:54,520
- Cheers, mate.
- That's nine pound twenty, mate.

534
00:34:55,033 --> 00:34:58,065
You know what, mate, I got passed
by five black cabs today.

535
00:34:58,265 --> 00:35:00,304
- Well, that ain't my fault, mate.
- Just because I'm black.

536
00:35:00,536 --> 00:35:03,437
Ain't that ironic, though, like?
Black cab don't take black man.

537
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:06,007
- So, what's your point?
- My point is that...

538
00:35:06,008 --> 00:35:07,829
it becomes a vicious circle.

539
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:10,029
- Well, what's that mean?
- It means...

540
00:35:11,767 --> 00:35:13,457
Come back!

541
00:35:15,158 --> 00:35:17,546
- Come on.
- You little black bastard!

542
00:35:49,617 --> 00:35:51,591
Now I'm hungry.

543
00:35:52,177 --> 00:35:54,249
Why did you bring me here again?

544
00:35:54,864 --> 00:35:57,765
We give him some dope and he gives us
money for our dresses.

545
00:35:57,968 --> 00:35:58,982
Can we get it and go, please,
because I'm really tired...

546
00:35:59,088 --> 00:36:00,909
of listening to you two fuck.
Look...

547
00:36:01,295 --> 00:36:03,945
I didn't know he was gonna be so old.

548
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:05,997
He's twenty-eight. He's an actor.

549
00:36:06,542 --> 00:36:08,614
That's almost twice our age.

550
00:36:08,814 --> 00:36:11,366
I know, but he thinks I'm eighteen,
though, so...

551
00:36:13,677 --> 00:36:15,465
You were good, baby.

552
00:36:17,741 --> 00:36:19,819
You lot want anything else?

553
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:20,867
No.

554
00:36:27,211 --> 00:36:28,682
Hang on, hang on,
I thought she was pregnant?

555
00:36:28,683 --> 00:36:30,570
Yeah, she is right now,
but she's getting rid of it.

556
00:36:30,986 --> 00:36:33,407
- Go on, Lis, it's good.
- Okay.

557
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:37,732
So how much do you want for all this?
Three hundred?

558
00:36:38,538 --> 00:36:39,399
Yeah.

559
00:36:40,105 --> 00:36:42,046
All right, I'll go get it.

560
00:36:45,288 --> 00:36:46,781
Right, I'll be back
in a minute, yeah?

561
00:36:51,624 --> 00:36:54,078
So, you like what you see, huh?

562
00:36:54,759 --> 00:36:55,838
No.

563
00:36:56,263 --> 00:36:57,986
So what do you
come upstairs for then?

564
00:36:58,311 --> 00:37:01,539
- I wanted to see if she was all right.
- She was fucking great.

565
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:04,000
- I bet you are as well.
- Fuck off!

566
00:37:04,741 --> 00:37:05,755
You're sick.

567
00:37:06,086 --> 00:37:08,671
- You know she's only fifteen?
- Yeah, of course I do.

568
00:37:08,869 --> 00:37:10,690
I found her student card.

569
00:37:10,885 --> 00:37:12,794
She thinks
it's her little secret.

570
00:37:15,012 --> 00:37:16,800
Do you know
what my little secret is?

571
00:37:17,892 --> 00:37:19,549
Go on, have a guess.

572
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:21,503
I'm a fucking bastard.

573
00:37:25,475 --> 00:37:28,027
You know, I've never fucked
a pregnant girl before...

574
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:30,591
but, with you,
I think I'd make the exception.

575
00:37:30,818 --> 00:37:32,410
How about you fuck yourself?

576
00:37:33,218 --> 00:37:35,999
You should take the chance
while you can, you little slag.

577
00:37:36,161 --> 00:37:38,331
- What did you just call me?
- I called you a fucking little slag...

578
00:37:38,465 --> 00:37:41,055
because you're fifteen years old
and you're pregnant.

579
00:37:41,056 --> 00:37:43,422
Probably some little black fellow
who hasn't hung around.

580
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,374
But that's cool,
because I like you.

581
00:37:50,175 --> 00:37:52,062
So when you've decided
to dump it...

582
00:37:52,734 --> 00:37:54,643
why don't you come back
and see me?

583
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:56,541
You won't have to get jealous of me
fucking your mate...

584
00:37:56,542 --> 00:37:58,429
because I'll probably
fuck you too.

585
00:38:02,077 --> 00:38:03,091
You know...

586
00:38:03,325 --> 00:38:06,074
- you're not right about everything.
- What's that, then?

587
00:38:06,876 --> 00:38:08,664
You're not a bastard...

588
00:38:11,995 --> 00:38:13,238
you're a cunt.

589
00:38:17,563 --> 00:38:20,432
Right, ready for round two, baby?

590
00:38:37,144 --> 00:38:39,248
Boy! This shop is heavy.

591
00:38:39,671 --> 00:38:42,092
Good afternoon, sirs.
Can I help you?

592
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:45,522
- Yeah. Where are your hats, rude girl?
- Downstairs, sir.

593
00:38:53,173 --> 00:38:54,928
- It's here?
- It's over there.

594
00:38:55,669 --> 00:38:57,010
This is what you want, isn't?

595
00:38:58,389 --> 00:38:59,730
What do you think?

596
00:39:06,228 --> 00:39:07,951
You know what,
blood fuck that guard, man.

597
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,107
You know what,
can we kick, man?

598
00:39:09,107 --> 00:39:10,994
I'm sure they've got better stuff
down the road anyway.

599
00:39:23,601 --> 00:39:24,713
Hey!

600
00:39:24,976 --> 00:39:26,382
Wait.

601
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,800
Come on, come on.
Come with me. Come on.

602
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,745
Get the fuck off me, man!
What you doing?

603
00:39:32,975 --> 00:39:34,318
- You're in a lot of trouble, mate.
- For what?

604
00:39:34,319 --> 00:39:36,904
- Stealing that hat.
- I had it on when I come in, man.

605
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:39,949
- What's he taken?
- The cap.

606
00:39:40,078 --> 00:39:41,582
He had it on
when we came in, bro.

607
00:39:41,582 --> 00:39:43,174
Hey, pipe down, please.
And I'm not your bro.

608
00:39:43,438 --> 00:39:45,293
Oi, fuck off, blood, about pipe down.
Get off me, man!

609
00:39:45,293 --> 00:39:46,950
Listen, I told you,
I fucking had that when I come in.

610
00:39:47,181 --> 00:39:48,871
- Don't swear at me.
- And what the fuck you gonna do?

611
00:39:49,101 --> 00:39:50,412
You better watch it,
the police have been called.

612
00:39:50,413 --> 00:39:51,874
Hey, call them, man.
I don't give a fuck.

613
00:39:52,108 --> 00:39:53,548
I'll tell them, too.
I had the hat when I come in.

614
00:39:53,548 --> 00:39:54,475
Hey, check your cameras, man.

615
00:39:54,476 --> 00:39:56,012
Nisha, would you call
the police, please.

616
00:39:56,012 --> 00:39:58,662
This young man has taken this hat
and is now causing a commotion.

617
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:00,615
- Is that all he's taken?
- Yeah.

618
00:40:00,843 --> 00:40:02,849
But he was wearing that cap
when he came in.

619
00:40:03,018 --> 00:40:05,066
- Are you sure?
- Yes, because I greeted him.

620
00:40:05,067 --> 00:40:06,211
Thank you!

621
00:40:06,443 --> 00:40:08,417
- I'm not sure that he was.
- I am sure. Sorry.

622
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:10,853
Move out the fucking way
and let us out, man! Yo, blood.

623
00:40:11,018 --> 00:40:14,050
- Are you gonna fucking apologise, coz?
- Just leave, please.

624
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,850
- Hey, hold up, man.
- What?

625
00:40:19,944 --> 00:40:23,107
Do you know what?
You want your hat so much, take it.

626
00:40:25,095 --> 00:40:26,436
Fucking prick!

627
00:40:30,246 --> 00:40:33,474
I'm stinging. Were you watching?
I bet you could hear, isn't it?

628
00:40:35,462 --> 00:40:37,949
So, three hundred squids, yeah, babes.
We'll split it down the mids.

629
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:40,702
You got shoes, right?
We can't be looking like no tramps.

630
00:40:40,933 --> 00:40:41,540
Yeah.

631
00:40:41,541 --> 00:40:43,428
You are looking forward
to tonight, yeah?

632
00:40:43,493 --> 00:40:44,804
I don't know, yeah, probably.

633
00:40:44,804 --> 00:40:46,691
What's the matter, then?
You look like someone just...

634
00:40:46,884 --> 00:40:50,560
Exactly. Look,
I've been thinking about stuff.

635
00:40:51,363 --> 00:40:53,751
Me like this,
Katie killing herself.

636
00:40:54,179 --> 00:40:57,080
I mean, that is why
we got the day off.

637
00:40:57,251 --> 00:40:59,105
I don't know, maybe
we shouldn't go to the party.

638
00:40:59,298 --> 00:41:00,353
What?

639
00:41:00,354 --> 00:41:03,648
I don't know.
It's like, it's weird. It's strange.

640
00:41:03,874 --> 00:41:07,451
She was so tall and pretty...
I wish I was that tall.

641
00:41:09,377 --> 00:41:11,896
You know, I reckon
she could have been a model.

642
00:41:12,417 --> 00:41:14,208
I knew she was troubled, but...

643
00:41:14,208 --> 00:41:16,831
I never thought it was that bad
that she'd have to kill herself.

644
00:41:16,832 --> 00:41:18,904
Well, it's done now.
Nothing we can do.

645
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:22,228
- I could have stuck up for her.
- So why didn't you?

646
00:41:22,431 --> 00:41:23,294
I don't know.

647
00:41:23,294 --> 00:41:26,013
Well, she's dead now.
Get over it. I am.

648
00:41:26,014 --> 00:41:28,734
Don't you ever think about anything
but yourself?

649
00:41:28,734 --> 00:41:31,483
Yeah.
Clothes, shoes, money, sex.

650
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:34,011
Wait, sex involves me
though, don't it?

651
00:41:34,749 --> 00:41:36,690
Do you think Moony likes me?

652
00:41:36,893 --> 00:41:38,714
- I don't know.
- He's so fine.

653
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:40,860
I won't fuck him
unless he eats me out.

654
00:41:40,861 --> 00:41:43,260
- Do you think he will?
- I don't know.

655
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:44,852
So when you gonna get rid
of this baby?

656
00:41:46,235 --> 00:41:47,958
- Lis?
- Just leave it, Becky, yeah?

657
00:41:55,450 --> 00:41:58,864
Saint Martin Girls.
What you lot saying?

658
00:41:59,129 --> 00:42:01,998
Oi, do you hear about that big bird
girl that committed suicide?

659
00:42:02,201 --> 00:42:03,345
Proper sensitive, isn't it?

660
00:42:03,608 --> 00:42:06,673
She got so upset.
We was only joking with her.

661
00:42:06,936 --> 00:42:08,823
- Didn't look like a joke.
- Lis, shush.

662
00:42:09,016 --> 00:42:12,244
She just got a bit feisty, that's all.
She needed a little bit of slapping.

663
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:15,788
But we was only playing with her.
We never meant her to slit her wrists.

664
00:42:16,631 --> 00:42:19,532
- She hung herself.
- Whatever. She's dead.

665
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:23,538
- Because of you.
- What?

666
00:42:23,734 --> 00:42:25,493
She killed herself because you
and your friends bullied her...

667
00:42:25,493 --> 00:42:26,986
till she couldn't take it
no more.

668
00:42:27,413 --> 00:42:29,268
- You killed her.
- Shut up, you sket.

669
00:42:29,269 --> 00:42:30,577
- You killed her.
- Fucking shut up.

670
00:42:30,773 --> 00:42:31,700
You killed her.

671
00:42:31,925 --> 00:42:34,346
Listen, right, if you don't fucking
shut up, you're gonna join her.

672
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:37,034
Look she don't mean it, yeah. Please,
don't beat us up. She's pregnant.

673
00:42:38,708 --> 00:42:40,649
You're that girl
that Sam fucked.

674
00:42:40,851 --> 00:42:43,370
Wait till I tell everyone
about this ho.

675
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:44,754
You know what?
Yeah, tell them.

676
00:42:44,755 --> 00:42:47,504
Tell them Alisa's pregnant
and she's keeping the fucking baby.

677
00:42:47,858 --> 00:42:50,191
- What?
- I ain't scared of you.

678
00:42:50,514 --> 00:42:52,684
If you're gonna do something
to me, then do it.

679
00:42:54,993 --> 00:42:56,072
Go on.

680
00:42:57,008 --> 00:42:59,909
I got bigger things to worry about
than what you can do to me.

681
00:43:13,166 --> 00:43:14,442
What's the matter?

682
00:43:16,078 --> 00:43:18,695
- You should bang her up, star.
- I should, shouldn't I?

683
00:43:22,029 --> 00:43:24,395
What the fuck were you thinking,
Alisa? They could have beat us up.

684
00:43:24,588 --> 00:43:26,114
- So?
- You're so selfish.

685
00:43:26,349 --> 00:43:28,737
What if my face got scarred
or something?

686
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:30,827
And what the fuck are you talking about
"keeping the baby"?

687
00:43:30,892 --> 00:43:31,851
You're not gonna have
an abortion now?

688
00:43:31,852 --> 00:43:34,917
- Just leave it, Becky.
- So, what, are you like pro-life now?

689
00:43:35,083 --> 00:43:37,253
No, but a girl we both
knew just died...

690
00:43:37,451 --> 00:43:39,272
and I didn't do anything
to stop it.

691
00:43:39,371 --> 00:43:42,217
- But I can do something about this.
- So, okay...

692
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:43,489
what about school?

693
00:43:43,722 --> 00:43:45,609
What if you'd have got raped?
Would you have an abortion then?

694
00:43:45,801 --> 00:43:48,037
- I don't know. Yeah, probably.
- You have to get rid of it.

695
00:43:48,201 --> 00:43:50,753
- Who's gonna help you?
- I don't need any help.

696
00:43:53,673 --> 00:43:56,225
- You all right?
- Yeah, it's morning sickness.

697
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:00,388
- It's not morning though.
- Look, I need to speak to Trife.

698
00:44:00,583 --> 00:44:04,128
Let's go and buy our garms.
And then we'll find him, okay? Come on.

699
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:12,291
Curtis lives up there.

700
00:44:15,077 --> 00:44:17,313
- What, is that it?
- I think so.

701
00:44:18,692 --> 00:44:19,836
You think so?

702
00:44:21,156 --> 00:44:22,879
You think...
you think so?

703
00:44:25,059 --> 00:44:27,480
Do you think I've got time
for what people think now, Del?

704
00:44:27,747 --> 00:44:29,885
- Is this the place, bro?
- Yes, it's the place.

705
00:44:30,499 --> 00:44:32,767
But you gotta do this
on your own, bruv.

706
00:44:33,027 --> 00:44:34,881
I'll wait for you back at mine.

707
00:44:35,138 --> 00:44:38,236
- You're gonna go now, is it?
- I can't be seen here, man.

708
00:44:44,768 --> 00:44:46,229
What would you do, man?

709
00:44:46,465 --> 00:44:47,926
What would you do, man?

710
00:45:03,197 --> 00:45:05,946
- That was a forty five pound hat, bloods.
- So?

711
00:45:06,301 --> 00:45:08,210
You could've give it to me
for tonight, like.

712
00:45:08,477 --> 00:45:11,029
Blood, it wouldn't have fit
your big African head anyway, man.

713
00:45:11,869 --> 00:45:13,112
Oh my days!

714
00:45:13,884 --> 00:45:16,475
You man, you man, you man,
check that gash over there, blood.

715
00:45:16,476 --> 00:45:19,541
- Shit, check the back of, rude boy.
- She's bathing as well, you know.

716
00:45:19,612 --> 00:45:22,458
See, that's what I want, blood.
I want a rich bitch like that.

717
00:45:22,651 --> 00:45:24,560
Yeah, so, so what, who's on it?
Me, yeah?

718
00:45:24,634 --> 00:45:26,772
No, blood, that's me, man.
I saw her first, isn't it?

719
00:45:26,842 --> 00:45:28,270
My size.

720
00:45:29,146 --> 00:45:30,672
My size.
Hey, darling, I'm...

721
00:45:31,609 --> 00:45:33,615
Hey, girl,
I'm talking to you, man.

722
00:45:34,010 --> 00:45:35,798
I'm chatting to you!

723
00:45:37,721 --> 00:45:39,662
I don't think she's on it.

724
00:45:40,664 --> 00:45:42,768
Blood, can't chat to a girl
like that, man.

725
00:45:42,968 --> 00:45:44,560
You think you're nang, blood? Why
don't you show him how to do it, then?

726
00:45:44,823 --> 00:45:46,284
Fuck it.
Let's duck, man.

727
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:49,778
He don't wanna check for that
because he's still on Alisa, isn't it?

728
00:45:51,223 --> 00:45:53,524
Man, I'll show you now
I can chat to that girl, man.

729
00:45:53,942 --> 00:45:55,403
Go on then.

730
00:45:58,390 --> 00:46:01,738
- Why is he always on our hype, man?
- He thinks he's big, man.

731
00:46:02,325 --> 00:46:04,779
- Hey, can I help you?
- Do you work here?

732
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:06,889
No, sorry,
just making conversation.

733
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:09,834
I wouldn't buy
these trainers, though.

734
00:46:10,228 --> 00:46:12,780
- Seriously, I wouldn't.
- Why not?

735
00:46:13,043 --> 00:46:14,610
Well, the front always comes off.

736
00:46:14,611 --> 00:46:16,879
Plus, those are the old ones.
New ones are upstairs.

737
00:46:19,506 --> 00:46:20,749
Trevor.

738
00:46:23,282 --> 00:46:24,110
Stella.

739
00:46:29,649 --> 00:46:32,812
- Want a zoot, blood?
- Yeah. Come, we get out of here, man.

740
00:46:33,776 --> 00:46:35,280
You know I could have got
the number though, isn't it?

741
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,134
- So could I, blood.
- I don't think so, blood.

742
00:46:37,935 --> 00:46:40,389
You look smart...
What do you do?

743
00:46:40,623 --> 00:46:44,005
Smart. That's a new one.
What... like smartly dressed?

744
00:46:44,271 --> 00:46:46,856
- No, clever, intelligent.
- Thank you.

745
00:46:48,974 --> 00:46:50,184
I'm an architect.

746
00:46:51,213 --> 00:46:53,100
Rings? You married?

747
00:46:54,445 --> 00:46:55,851
Yeah, my...

748
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:58,281
husband's been away
a while.

749
00:46:58,604 --> 00:47:01,058
If I was your husband,
I'd never leave you.

750
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:03,266
And I don't need Viagra,
you know.

751
00:47:03,435 --> 00:47:04,579
Thank you...

752
00:47:05,451 --> 00:47:06,977
that's useful to know.

753
00:47:08,363 --> 00:47:10,337
Don't you get lonely
by yourself?

754
00:47:11,595 --> 00:47:12,707
Yeah.

755
00:47:13,835 --> 00:47:15,143
Yeah. I do.

756
00:47:16,873 --> 00:47:19,425
Actually, sometimes I could use
a bit of company.

757
00:47:19,690 --> 00:47:22,023
- I'd keep you company.
- I bet you would.

758
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:28,741
- How old are you?
- How old are you?

759
00:47:29,288 --> 00:47:30,781
Twenty-six. You?

760
00:47:31,015 --> 00:47:33,796
- I'm twenty-three.
- You're not twenty-three.

761
00:47:34,055 --> 00:47:36,094
All right, I'm twenty-two,
but I'm mature, man.

762
00:47:36,295 --> 00:47:38,847
- Twenty-two? Really?
- All right, I'm twenty, I swear.

763
00:47:40,134 --> 00:47:42,213
It's not like I'm trying it on
or anything.

764
00:47:42,214 --> 00:47:43,457
Good.

765
00:47:45,285 --> 00:47:47,423
Because I wouldn't want
to disappoint you.

766
00:47:59,652 --> 00:48:01,315
My girl puts onion in my burger.

767
00:48:01,315 --> 00:48:02,786
But, blood, man, you shouldn't have
thrown it, though, isn't it?

768
00:48:02,787 --> 00:48:04,001
She didn't do what I asked.

769
00:48:04,002 --> 00:48:05,250
You should have gave
the burger to me, blood, man.

770
00:48:05,251 --> 00:48:09,079
- Man, I don't like onions.
- Hey, what happened, man?

771
00:48:09,314 --> 00:48:11,931
She's a cock tease, man. She's on it,
and then she ducked, isn't it?

772
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:14,649
That's a bit weird. White girls
usually fuck you for a browns.

773
00:48:14,849 --> 00:48:16,831
- I knew you wouldn't get that, rude boy.
- Standard.

774
00:48:16,832 --> 00:48:20,028
Shut up, man. I'm still gonna bang
that when I go see her.

775
00:48:20,224 --> 00:48:22,143
How are you gonna bang her, blood
and go see her when she kicked out.

776
00:48:22,144 --> 00:48:24,159
Are you stupid or something?

777
00:48:24,159 --> 00:48:25,206
No.

778
00:48:25,439 --> 00:48:27,031
I got this,
and I'm gonna bring it to her.

779
00:48:27,263 --> 00:48:28,062
Hey, blood, hold him,
hold him, hold him.

780
00:48:28,063 --> 00:48:29,982
Jay, I beg you, pass it back, man.
Hey, Moons, Moons, Moons. Hey, Jay.

781
00:48:29,983 --> 00:48:32,917
Blood, she got plenty dollars in here,
you know. And she's a...

782
00:48:35,998 --> 00:48:37,819
Boy! What the fuck are you doing, man?
Where are you going?

783
00:48:38,046 --> 00:48:39,677
- Leave it. Leave it out, he's a youth.
- Or what, coz?

784
00:48:39,677 --> 00:48:42,196
Or else I'll bust you in your head
you fucking white pussyhole!

785
00:48:42,269 --> 00:48:43,861
What? Blood, you think because
I'm white, I won't knock you out?

786
00:48:44,093 --> 00:48:45,401
Is that right, blood?
Yo, let me take my hat off.

787
00:48:45,628 --> 00:48:46,936
How about white boy,
skinhead nutter, mate?

788
00:48:47,164 --> 00:48:48,854
Does that work better for you,
dickhead?

789
00:48:51,547 --> 00:48:52,724
Oi.

790
00:48:58,170 --> 00:49:00,144
- Shit.
- That's really good though, cousin.

791
00:49:02,362 --> 00:49:03,823
What, man,
you think that scares me?

792
00:49:05,433 --> 00:49:06,861
Man, you don't even know me.

793
00:49:08,281 --> 00:49:09,906
Low it low it, come on, come on.

794
00:49:10,136 --> 00:49:12,274
Just get out of here, man.
You men got murked, like.

795
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:19,413
- What the fuck is wrong with you, man?
- What are you talking about?

796
00:49:19,607 --> 00:49:22,126
You! Starting fights
in the middle of the street, man.

797
00:49:22,295 --> 00:49:23,254
I was backing you up, blood.

798
00:49:23,255 --> 00:49:24,716
That's not what
I'm talking about, blood.

799
00:49:24,919 --> 00:49:26,674
If we plan something together,
that's cool.

800
00:49:26,870 --> 00:49:28,373
But that was under control
until you started, man.

801
00:49:28,374 --> 00:49:30,070
You can't just start arms house
in the middle of the street.

802
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:31,989
- What's wrong with you, blood?
- Just cool it, Jay, man.

803
00:49:31,990 --> 00:49:33,909
All right, man.
So where's the purse?

804
00:49:33,909 --> 00:49:36,461
Wait, blood. I told you, yeah,
I want the fucking cards, isn't it.

805
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:38,131
No, man, who fucking took it?
Give me the purse!

806
00:49:38,132 --> 00:49:39,244
Blood, man, you want,
you want the cards, yeah?

807
00:49:39,477 --> 00:49:40,687
- Yes, I want the fucking cards.
- You want the cards.

808
00:49:40,884 --> 00:49:42,410
- Hey, Moons. Moons.
- Hey, blood, don't fuck about.

809
00:49:42,676 --> 00:49:44,301
So what, you can share
your girl with Sam...

810
00:49:44,468 --> 00:49:45,492
and you can't even share
the purse with us, blood.

811
00:49:45,492 --> 00:49:47,052
You fucking prick.

812
00:49:48,307 --> 00:49:50,194
- Get the fuck off me!
- Fuck is wrong with you, blood?

813
00:49:50,354 --> 00:49:51,815
We're gonna split that or not?
All right, that's what it's got to?

814
00:49:52,051 --> 00:49:55,399
You know what, take your fucking
purse, you like it so much.

815
00:49:55,666 --> 00:49:56,843
You're a dickhead, man.

816
00:49:56,946 --> 00:49:58,669
Hey, blood,
don't take it out on us...

817
00:49:58,961 --> 00:50:00,815
because your girl
got pressed by next man.

818
00:50:01,169 --> 00:50:02,832
If you was somebody else, I would have
stabbed your claret, rude boy!

819
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:05,352
Stab me then, blood!
My uncle'll kill you!

820
00:50:05,552 --> 00:50:08,169
You and your fucking uncle, man!
If my man's even real.

821
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,788
You know what, blood, if he is real,
yeah, you better go to him, isn't it?

822
00:50:10,863 --> 00:50:13,448
Because, blood, you ain't got no-one
no more, man. You ain't got Alisa.

823
00:50:13,647 --> 00:50:15,173
You ain't got that sket no more.

824
00:50:15,407 --> 00:50:18,057
And we ain't backing you no more.
Come, Moons, man.

825
00:50:18,254 --> 00:50:22,214
Hey, who the fuck you chatting to, man?
Without me, you two ain't shit!

826
00:50:22,414 --> 00:50:24,235
And Alisa, I can have her if I want,
but I don't need her.

827
00:50:24,430 --> 00:50:26,157
I don't need pussyhole friends
like you, either.

828
00:50:26,158 --> 00:50:27,913
Yeah, you keep telling
yourself that, blood.

829
00:50:28,109 --> 00:50:31,628
Remember, we might call you Trife
but your name's Trevor.

830
00:50:31,628 --> 00:50:33,896
- Remember that, blood.
- Come, we jet, blood.

831
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:05,857
Claire, honey,
Sam's here to see you.

832
00:51:08,391 --> 00:51:10,114
Thanks, Mrs. Parkinson.

833
00:51:10,439 --> 00:51:12,380
I'll leave you kids to it.

834
00:51:17,990 --> 00:51:19,396
- Where are they?
- Who?

835
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:22,909
Don't try to boy me off,
them three little pussyholes.

836
00:51:23,141 --> 00:51:24,253
I don't know.

837
00:51:25,284 --> 00:51:27,388
I'm only gonna ask you this
one more time.

838
00:51:27,588 --> 00:51:29,376
- Where are they?
- I don't know.

839
00:51:29,604 --> 00:51:30,748
Jeez.

840
00:51:32,707 --> 00:51:34,690
Listen, yeah.
My mum nearly broke her arm.

841
00:51:34,691 --> 00:51:36,959
You better start talking,
or I'm gonna bang you up, you hear me?

842
00:51:37,154 --> 00:51:40,536
When we get to school, I'm gonna tell
everyone what a rubbish fuck you are.

843
00:51:40,738 --> 00:51:43,519
And how bad you smell.
If you know what I'm saying.

844
00:51:43,746 --> 00:51:46,265
Please, don't, I really don't know
where they are.

845
00:51:46,465 --> 00:51:49,497
All I know is that they're going to
that party tonight.

846
00:51:50,721 --> 00:51:52,444
That's where they're gonna be.

847
00:51:53,984 --> 00:51:55,893
So why weren't I invited?

848
00:51:56,064 --> 00:51:58,649
Because no-one
that's going likes you.

849
00:52:01,695 --> 00:52:04,345
Sam, stop, please.
I'm sorry.

850
00:52:05,246 --> 00:52:05,911
Claire?

851
00:52:06,687 --> 00:52:08,093
Claire, baby, are you all right?

852
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:11,226
Yeah, mum, I'm fine.

853
00:52:12,221 --> 00:52:14,609
Me and Sam are just talking.

854
00:52:14,781 --> 00:52:15,412
Okay.

855
00:52:16,157 --> 00:52:18,011
Use a condom,
sweetheart.

856
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:21,148
That brings me
to my next question.

857
00:52:22,236 --> 00:52:23,577
Whose girl are you?

858
00:52:23,931 --> 00:52:25,752
Because I don't even know
why I bother with you.

859
00:52:26,011 --> 00:52:29,658
You're ugly, you're a shit fuck, and
you're with me, like sixth-form top boy.

860
00:52:29,659 --> 00:52:32,528
If it weren't for me,
who would even look at you?

861
00:52:32,762 --> 00:52:33,939
I don't know.

862
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:38,266
- Why did you sleep with Alisa?
- Why'd you fuck that fucking Jay?

863
00:52:38,266 --> 00:52:40,175
In my drum as well!

864
00:52:40,569 --> 00:52:42,226
I don't know. I'm sorry.

865
00:52:43,224 --> 00:52:44,717
It's all right, it's all right.

866
00:52:45,785 --> 00:52:49,428
It's just... I do everything you want,
whenever you want me to.

867
00:52:49,656 --> 00:52:52,971
So why are you mean to me
and all that? I don't understand.

868
00:52:55,895 --> 00:52:57,171
Come here.

869
00:53:28,690 --> 00:53:31,820
Okay, so Plaza, yeah?
In an hour.

870
00:53:32,049 --> 00:53:34,121
- All right, then. Bye.
- Right, see you then. Bye.

871
00:53:39,888 --> 00:53:41,349
Come fuck on, man.

872
00:53:43,568 --> 00:53:47,145
Look, what you need is
some retail therapy, yeah?

873
00:53:47,407 --> 00:53:50,221
Alisa says to meet her in the cafe thing
downstairs in one hour.

874
00:53:50,383 --> 00:53:52,366
What, did you tell her
that Trife ain't here?

875
00:53:52,367 --> 00:53:53,315
No.

876
00:53:53,550 --> 00:53:54,574
Are you a fool or something,
blood?

877
00:53:54,574 --> 00:53:56,749
You don't think she really wants
to chat to you, do you?

878
00:53:56,750 --> 00:53:57,764
I don't know.

879
00:53:57,966 --> 00:54:00,781
You know, fuck it isn't it, I'll tell her,
I'll give her a piece of my mind, man.

880
00:54:00,781 --> 00:54:01,708
You get me?

881
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:09,121
Oh my God, that dress looks dark
on you. Is that the one you want?

882
00:54:09,324 --> 00:54:10,665
Yeah, I think so.

883
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:12,801
Well, I got all these.
I can't make my mind up.

884
00:54:13,036 --> 00:54:14,410
We are gonna be the hottest girls
there tonight.

885
00:54:14,507 --> 00:54:16,513
Everyone else is gonna look like
tramps compared to us.

886
00:54:16,747 --> 00:54:19,466
Hi, madam, can I help?
Is that the dress you like?

887
00:54:19,466 --> 00:54:20,807
- Yeah.
- It looks great on you.

888
00:54:21,034 --> 00:54:23,530
Well, if you pull your
hair back like this...

889
00:54:23,530 --> 00:54:25,634
it will accentuate
your fabulous figure.

890
00:54:25,962 --> 00:54:27,717
- Thank you.
- Nice figure?

891
00:54:27,913 --> 00:54:29,512
Not for long.
She's knocked up.

892
00:54:29,512 --> 00:54:32,031
Congratulations.
My wife is pregnant.

893
00:54:32,456 --> 00:54:35,270
- Wife? I thought you were a batty man.
- Excuse me?

894
00:54:35,592 --> 00:54:37,152
- Ain't you gay?
- No.

895
00:54:37,384 --> 00:54:39,488
- There's nothing wrong with it.
- I know, I'm just saying.

896
00:54:39,719 --> 00:54:41,693
- All right, calm down, Yankee.
- I'm Canadian.

897
00:54:41,895 --> 00:54:44,065
- Same thing.
- Excuse me, how much is this one?

898
00:54:44,551 --> 00:54:46,689
This one is a hundred
and thirty pounds.

899
00:54:48,198 --> 00:54:49,310
Becks?

900
00:54:57,733 --> 00:54:59,325
Well, I want this one.
How much is it?

901
00:55:03,684 --> 00:55:05,788
This one is two hundred
and ten pounds.

902
00:55:06,755 --> 00:55:09,721
Lis, can you not find another one?
I really want this one.

903
00:55:09,891 --> 00:55:12,224
- We've got three hundred between us.
- Yeah, and you said you'd split it.

904
00:55:12,418 --> 00:55:14,043
Look, who got the money?

905
00:55:14,242 --> 00:55:16,958
I'm doing you a favour
in the first place by getting you one.

906
00:55:17,057 --> 00:55:18,976
Come on, soon you'll have
a big fat belly anyway.

907
00:55:18,977 --> 00:55:20,405
You won't be able to wear it.

908
00:55:20,641 --> 00:55:23,422
You've still got ninety quid.
I'm sure you can get something nice.

909
00:55:23,616 --> 00:55:24,512
Don't worry, honey.

910
00:55:24,513 --> 00:55:27,000
I'll find you something to make
you look even more fabulous.

911
00:56:40,277 --> 00:56:42,164
- Trevor?
- Yeah.

912
00:56:42,932 --> 00:56:44,208
He'll be with you in a sec.

913
00:56:46,101 --> 00:56:47,988
You're a handsome one,
aren't you?

914
00:57:03,953 --> 00:57:05,065
Trevor.

915
00:57:05,969 --> 00:57:08,718
- What happen?
- You told me to reach.

916
00:57:09,521 --> 00:57:11,309
Debbie look after you?

917
00:57:12,048 --> 00:57:13,095
Yeah.

918
00:57:18,351 --> 00:57:19,495
Come.

919
00:57:20,399 --> 00:57:23,081
Me like the work you did
on that thing.

920
00:57:25,870 --> 00:57:26,884
This...

921
00:57:28,238 --> 00:57:29,579
is for you.

922
00:57:33,294 --> 00:57:34,635
See, I told you I would, man.

923
00:57:34,829 --> 00:57:35,980
If you want me to do
anything else, I'm...

924
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:37,954
Just cool yourself, man.

925
00:57:46,315 --> 00:57:47,776
What's that?

926
00:57:48,747 --> 00:57:50,088
Heroin.

927
00:57:51,723 --> 00:57:54,275
- You want some?
- I'm cool, man.

928
00:57:55,370 --> 00:57:56,482
Go on...

929
00:57:58,346 --> 00:57:59,622
take some.

930
00:58:12,455 --> 00:58:14,112
You grow fast, man.

931
00:58:15,655 --> 00:58:16,898
Anyway...

932
00:58:18,343 --> 00:58:20,098
me like the work
you did on the gun.

933
00:58:20,166 --> 00:58:22,653
- It's easy, I can...
- Don't speak, just listen.

934
00:58:27,205 --> 00:58:28,186
You know...

935
00:58:29,189 --> 00:58:32,003
all you need in this world
is money...

936
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:36,055
and if you know how to get it,
you laughing.

937
00:58:36,868 --> 00:58:39,617
- You seen that nice TV in my front room?
- Yeah.

938
00:58:39,811 --> 00:58:43,388
You got one? No? But you'd like one,
of course you would.

939
00:58:43,778 --> 00:58:46,199
Curtis, I've got Keith
on the phone. He wants you to...

940
00:58:46,434 --> 00:58:48,572
Tell him that I talk to my nephew.
Tell him wait.

941
00:58:48,802 --> 00:58:51,038
But he's already on the phone.
He says he's...

942
00:58:51,617 --> 00:58:53,504
Me said tell him wait.

943
00:59:02,176 --> 00:59:03,124
Anyway...

944
00:59:06,015 --> 00:59:10,422
why you don't come work for,
with me?

945
00:59:11,391 --> 00:59:14,554
Trust me, I want to, man.
Fucking had enough of everything else.

946
00:59:16,606 --> 00:59:19,452
- So, what do you want me to do?
- Just a few little things.

947
00:59:19,645 --> 00:59:21,586
That sounds like something
you can do?

948
00:59:22,301 --> 00:59:24,569
Sounds live, man.
I'm there.

949
00:59:24,764 --> 00:59:26,454
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

950
00:59:26,684 --> 00:59:29,400
Me did sell the last
of the bad guns to some youth.

951
00:59:29,532 --> 00:59:32,433
Me have more of the replicas
for you to drill in the back.

952
00:59:32,635 --> 00:59:34,009
In the meantime...

953
00:59:36,507 --> 00:59:40,303
you did so well with this one
that me think you should have it.

954
01:00:03,031 --> 01:00:04,623
- So where is he?
- I told you.

955
01:00:05,143 --> 01:00:07,957
When he switched, yeah,
we just kicked out and left him, man.

956
01:00:08,214 --> 01:00:10,482
And don't bother trying to call him,
because his phone's off.

957
01:00:10,677 --> 01:00:11,953
Look, I really need
to speak to him.

958
01:00:12,149 --> 01:00:13,523
Listen up, everybody.

959
01:00:14,741 --> 01:00:15,853
Me say listen up.

960
01:00:17,877 --> 01:00:20,265
This is my nephew Trevor.

961
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:24,488
Real family member that will be joining
our family from now on...

962
01:00:24,659 --> 01:00:27,408
so, treat him nice.

963
01:00:27,699 --> 01:00:28,909
What going on, bro?

964
01:00:32,531 --> 01:00:35,213
What's up with this baby shit, man?
Is this true or something?

965
01:00:35,442 --> 01:00:37,383
Of course it's true.
Who's gonna lie about being pregnant?

966
01:00:37,553 --> 01:00:39,919
- Nuff people, man.
- Well, I'm not lying.

967
01:00:40,114 --> 01:00:41,265
All you do is lie.

968
01:00:41,265 --> 01:00:43,408
And now you've been caught out, you're
trying to drag Trife back into this.

969
01:00:43,408 --> 01:00:44,836
Try and fuck up his life,
isn't it?

970
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:46,763
Look, I think I should be speaking
to him about this, not you.

971
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:48,421
You are talking to me.

972
01:00:48,624 --> 01:00:50,314
And what exactly
are you gonna say to him?

973
01:00:50,383 --> 01:00:53,065
"I'm sorry, Trife I fucked another guy
while I was with you."

974
01:00:53,167 --> 01:00:54,926
Because it don't matter
because he knows now.

975
01:00:54,927 --> 01:00:56,333
I'm gonna tell him the truth.

976
01:00:58,958 --> 01:01:00,299
Listen, Trevor.

977
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:04,326
Come, I want you to handle
something for me.

978
01:01:10,093 --> 01:01:11,718
You're bad, isn't it?

979
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:17,665
You behave yourselves, yeah?

980
01:01:23,691 --> 01:01:25,119
Anything?

981
01:01:25,770 --> 01:01:29,566
You see, this is the reason
me want you to come work for me.

982
01:01:29,962 --> 01:01:31,816
- Curtis.
- Shut up!

983
01:01:32,329 --> 01:01:34,150
You see this fucker?

984
01:01:34,345 --> 01:01:37,094
Him take my property,
but my money never come back.

985
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:42,341
Where the fuck is my money,
nigger?

986
01:01:42,632 --> 01:01:44,420
I can get it for you, man.

987
01:01:45,159 --> 01:01:48,166
It's at my place. I told you
I was gonna bring it round later today.

988
01:01:48,166 --> 01:01:49,572
Hey, shut your mouth, blood.

989
01:01:49,799 --> 01:01:52,100
If he wanted it when you decided to
bring it and not when he asked for it...

990
01:01:52,295 --> 01:01:55,011
you wouldn't be tied
to a fucking table, would you?

991
01:02:00,421 --> 01:02:01,947
What are you waiting for?

992
01:02:05,989 --> 01:02:08,541
I'm sorry.
Please, I'm sorry.

993
01:02:08,740 --> 01:02:10,114
You know what, boy?

994
01:02:10,403 --> 01:02:12,704
I want you
to get my money today.

995
01:02:12,899 --> 01:02:14,175
- I will.
- But before you go...

996
01:02:14,435 --> 01:02:17,882
I'm gonna make sure you remember
that you don't fuck with Curtis.

997
01:02:23,522 --> 01:02:24,536
Trevor...

998
01:02:27,745 --> 01:02:31,093
I want you to carve a C from the corner
of him eye to the corner of him mouth.

999
01:02:34,016 --> 01:02:35,390
- Me?
- Yes...

1000
01:02:35,648 --> 01:02:36,792
you.

1001
01:02:44,190 --> 01:02:47,637
I want you
to carve a blood clotline...

1002
01:02:48,222 --> 01:02:50,709
from here to here.

1003
01:02:53,213 --> 01:02:55,219
Carve the fucking line.

1004
01:03:02,075 --> 01:03:04,049
No, let him.

1005
01:03:05,019 --> 01:03:06,033
Cut him.

1006
01:03:06,651 --> 01:03:07,599
Man.

1007
01:03:08,059 --> 01:03:10,065
Man, please!

1008
01:03:10,426 --> 01:03:11,538
Please!

1009
01:03:14,554 --> 01:03:15,633
No.

1010
01:03:22,873 --> 01:03:23,701
No!

1011
01:03:46,869 --> 01:03:48,210
Good.

1012
01:03:51,829 --> 01:03:53,650
Trevor... come.

1013
01:03:54,292 --> 01:03:55,469
Come here.

1014
01:03:56,628 --> 01:03:57,129
Trevor!

1015
01:04:07,858 --> 01:04:09,101
Please.

1016
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:29,166
The best thing you
could do right now is fuck off...

1017
01:04:29,166 --> 01:04:30,987
and get an abortion of Sam's baby.

1018
01:04:31,150 --> 01:04:33,386
Because he don't want you,
and Trife don't want you either.

1019
01:04:34,158 --> 01:04:35,237
What, has he said that?

1020
01:04:35,437 --> 01:04:38,436
- Who wants a sket like you?
- Has he told you he don't want me.

1021
01:04:39,118 --> 01:04:40,873
Yeah.
Now fuck off, isn't it.

1022
01:04:46,092 --> 01:04:48,360
What's up with your girlfriend,
though? Fucking Sam.

1023
01:04:48,524 --> 01:04:50,945
No wonder Trife dashed her, man,
she's a fucking ho like.

1024
01:04:51,051 --> 01:04:53,155
I know.
I couldn't be like that.

1025
01:04:53,355 --> 01:04:55,558
Only give my things
to special mans like you.

1026
01:04:55,787 --> 01:04:57,128
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1027
01:04:57,418 --> 01:04:58,595
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1028
01:04:58,794 --> 01:05:00,386
Becks, can we go?

1029
01:05:00,906 --> 01:05:03,807
- Where, to the party?
- No, I just wanna go home.

1030
01:05:04,266 --> 01:05:05,956
Well, I'm not ready.

1031
01:05:06,729 --> 01:05:09,663
- Becky, please, can we just go?
- Look, go if you wanna go.

1032
01:05:09,896 --> 01:05:13,278
Don't come to the party tonight, be a
boring cow. I'm staying with this lot.

1033
01:05:16,744 --> 01:05:18,816
You know what,
just do what you want, yeah?

1034
01:05:22,374 --> 01:05:23,388
Fat cunt.

1035
01:07:03,063 --> 01:07:04,623
I fucked that g¡rl
a few weeks ago, blood.

1036
01:07:05,016 --> 01:07:07,437
Every day for a week
when she's supposed to be your girl.

1037
01:07:07,639 --> 01:07:08,620
Why aren't you speaking to me?

1038
01:08:28,778 --> 01:08:30,665
So this party, where is it?

1039
01:08:30,987 --> 01:08:33,059
You're not still gonna go,
are you?

1040
01:08:33,738 --> 01:08:36,737
You saw what they done to my mum.
Where is it?

1041
01:08:39,305 --> 01:08:40,798
Nice invite.

1042
01:08:41,033 --> 01:08:43,203
- I don't think you should go.
- Why not?

1043
01:08:43,432 --> 01:08:46,911
I just think this thing with them lot
should stop or someone's gonna get hurt.

1044
01:08:47,144 --> 01:08:49,412
Your mum's all right
and you got me.

1045
01:08:49,607 --> 01:08:52,224
Stay here tonight,
we can fuck all night.

1046
01:08:52,872 --> 01:08:54,432
Promise me you'll stay.

1047
01:08:57,798 --> 01:08:59,358
All right, I promise.

1048
01:08:59,591 --> 01:09:02,307
I just wanna go home and check on
my mum, make sure she's all right.

1049
01:09:04,134 --> 01:09:06,816
- Cool. I'll see you later.
- Yeah, I'll see you later.

1050
01:09:13,636 --> 01:09:14,617
Alisa!

1051
01:09:15,332 --> 01:09:16,346
Alisa!

1052
01:09:16,708 --> 01:09:18,496
Wait. Alisa!

1053
01:09:22,051 --> 01:09:25,214
- What you doing?
- I'm going home. I only live over there.

1054
01:09:26,370 --> 01:09:28,224
- Your hand's bleeding, are you okay?
- Oh, shit.

1055
01:09:28,418 --> 01:09:29,595
Yeah, yeah.

1056
01:09:33,313 --> 01:09:35,319
- Have you been crying?
- No.

1057
01:09:37,088 --> 01:09:38,549
You look like you have.

1058
01:09:40,352 --> 01:09:42,239
Are you coming to Blake's party?

1059
01:09:42,464 --> 01:09:43,990
Oh, no, I'm really n
in the mood.

1060
01:09:44,927 --> 01:09:46,650
Come on, come with us.

1061
01:09:46,943 --> 01:09:48,120
I don't know.

1062
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:50,685
You look like you need to be around
some friends to cheer yourself up.

1063
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:51,579
Yeah.

1064
01:09:51,775 --> 01:09:55,222
I promise I'll do anything I can
to get you smiling again.

1065
01:09:55,550 --> 01:09:57,043
And how are you gonna do that?

1066
01:10:02,236 --> 01:10:03,642
Come on, come with me.

1067
01:10:04,828 --> 01:10:07,163
Okay. Let me just go home
and get changed, yeah?

1068
01:10:07,164 --> 01:10:09,913
But I'm only gonna come, like,
if I can hang out with you.

1069
01:10:29,337 --> 01:10:31,540
H¡, th¡s ¡s Al¡sa.
Please, leave...

1070
01:11:01,588 --> 01:11:05,449
Trife... enter, my friend.
While the parents are away and what not.

1071
01:11:06,036 --> 01:11:08,140
Want some of this?
It's Cuban.

1072
01:11:11,699 --> 01:11:12,909
Where's Alisa?

1073
01:11:13,266 --> 01:11:15,720
She's inside.
I think she went into the garden.

1074
01:12:07,786 --> 01:12:08,833
Bruv...

1075
01:12:09,674 --> 01:12:11,167
blood, sorry, man.

1076
01:12:11,402 --> 01:12:12,612
I'll see you later.

1077
01:12:12,874 --> 01:12:14,182
Sorry, bruv.

1078
01:12:16,297 --> 01:12:18,784
- What you doing?
- So, what, he's your man now?

1079
01:12:18,985 --> 01:12:21,951
No, but at least he's been nice to me
today. Look, what do you want?

1080
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:24,672
I wanted to say hello, isn't it.

1081
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:27,010
- Hello.
- How you doing?

1082
01:12:27,527 --> 01:12:29,574
If you wanna say something to me,
then say it and leave me alone.

1083
01:12:29,575 --> 01:12:31,843
- Hey, what happened to your hand?
- I got it cut.

1084
01:12:31,942 --> 01:12:33,829
- Are you all right?
- It's fine.

1085
01:12:34,598 --> 01:12:36,288
No, are you all right?

1086
01:12:39,493 --> 01:12:42,492
- So what do you do today?
- Nothing that would interest you.

1087
01:12:45,157 --> 01:12:47,906
Look, Lis, can we go somewhere
a bit more private, please?

1088
01:13:09,089 --> 01:13:10,368
So, what, where is he, then?

1089
01:13:10,368 --> 01:13:12,255
I don't know, I just saw him
come out here.

1090
01:13:12,768 --> 01:13:13,919
I'm going back in, man. This is...

1091
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:16,024
I don't know why
I come to your party, man.

1092
01:13:19,231 --> 01:13:22,808
- So what time you staying till?
- Cool, baby, we just got here, like.

1093
01:13:23,039 --> 01:13:26,005
True, it'll probably
get better later.

1094
01:13:26,206 --> 01:13:27,838
Would be better
if Blake weren't such a chief.

1095
01:13:27,838 --> 01:13:28,950
Look at him trying
to friends up Jay.

1096
01:13:29,213 --> 01:13:32,627
I mean... I'd consider this
a success, wouldn't you?

1097
01:13:35,005 --> 01:13:37,044
Jay, did I mention
how sharp you look.

1098
01:13:38,684 --> 01:13:40,145
Go away, Blake.

1099
01:13:44,699 --> 01:13:47,480
I know you tried to speak to me earlier
and I didn't want to listen...

1100
01:13:48,443 --> 01:13:50,352
but I wanna talk to you now.

1101
01:13:50,554 --> 01:13:54,001
Look, don't worry about your little
life, Trevor, I don't need your help.

1102
01:13:55,002 --> 01:13:57,390
And I'm sorry you had to hear
what you heard from Sam...

1103
01:13:57,594 --> 01:13:58,804
and I understand
that you don't want me...

1104
01:13:58,873 --> 01:14:00,727
but I thought you ought to know
that I never slept with...

1105
01:14:00,921 --> 01:14:05,230
All right. I know you never meant
to hurt me and blah, blah...

1106
01:14:05,688 --> 01:14:07,384
but before you carry on there's some
things I need to get off my head...

1107
01:14:07,384 --> 01:14:09,079
and if I don't,
I'm just gonna forget.

1108
01:14:09,079 --> 01:14:10,671
- Look, Trevor, you don't...
- Wait...

1109
01:14:14,743 --> 01:14:16,652
I'm on that, boy.

1110
01:14:17,174 --> 01:14:19,562
Excuse me, you came with me.

1111
01:14:19,831 --> 01:14:22,896
No, there's a difference.
You came with me.

1112
01:14:23,925 --> 01:14:26,095
But don't worry, though,
babes, like...

1113
01:14:26,165 --> 01:14:28,019
there's enough Moonies
to go around, isn't it, like.

1114
01:14:28,181 --> 01:14:29,424
So safe, yeah?

1115
01:14:29,877 --> 01:14:31,632
Yeah, Danielle,
what's going on then, man?

1116
01:14:31,860 --> 01:14:33,648
I see you at school the other day.
I wanted to come and talk to you...

1117
01:14:33,844 --> 01:14:35,370
but you're always with
your friends, man.

1118
01:14:35,540 --> 01:14:37,481
- You can still come up to me.
- No, but I don't like...

1119
01:14:37,715 --> 01:14:38,991
Please.

1120
01:14:40,691 --> 01:14:42,829
Danielle, I'm gonna come
chat to you in a sec, yeah?

1121
01:14:43,122 --> 01:14:45,128
So, with both your little buddies
doing there own thing...

1122
01:14:45,202 --> 01:14:47,056
is there anything
that you wanna do?

1123
01:14:47,410 --> 01:14:48,620
Like what?

1124
01:14:48,754 --> 01:14:50,062
Like me.

1125
01:14:50,322 --> 01:14:51,401
What?

1126
01:14:51,729 --> 01:14:53,670
Do you want to fuck me?

1127
01:14:55,025 --> 01:14:56,453
No, not really, I got a girl.

1128
01:14:56,624 --> 01:14:58,249
So? I won't tell her.

1129
01:14:58,704 --> 01:15:00,012
I thought you liked Moony?

1130
01:15:00,112 --> 01:15:02,118
No, I like you.

1131
01:15:02,575 --> 01:15:04,135
He's a bit of a fool.

1132
01:15:04,336 --> 01:15:05,612
That's one of my best friends
you're talking about down there.

1133
01:15:05,679 --> 01:15:07,533
Look, do you wanna fuck or not?

1134
01:15:09,294 --> 01:15:13,417
You can put it in my arse as well.
It hurts, but I don't mind.

1135
01:15:13,966 --> 01:15:16,332
No, low it, man.
Hey, Danielle.

1136
01:15:22,061 --> 01:15:23,205
What I wanted to say ¡s th¡s.

1137
01:15:23,692 --> 01:15:25,895
I know we were only going out
for a couple of months...

1138
01:15:26,924 --> 01:15:31,146
but it was fun, dred. You made me feel
like feel good, you get me?

1139
01:15:31,627 --> 01:15:35,172
I mean, not just sex. I mean, your
things feel good and everything, but...

1140
01:15:36,778 --> 01:15:38,021
you.

1141
01:15:39,978 --> 01:15:41,025
It was you.

1142
01:15:41,642 --> 01:15:45,219
But I didn't know what to do when you
started wanting hugs and that in school.

1143
01:15:45,417 --> 01:15:48,645
I started thinking about what the boys
would think and them stupidness there.

1144
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:52,705
When I broke up with you,
I realised I was stupid.

1145
01:15:53,480 --> 01:15:55,901
I told everyone, "I ain't going back
out with her", but...

1146
01:15:56,808 --> 01:15:58,116
I wanted to.

1147
01:16:00,967 --> 01:16:04,101
When I found out you fucked Sam,
it hurt me.

1148
01:16:04,102 --> 01:16:05,923
- Look, Trevor...
- Wait.

1149
01:16:08,774 --> 01:16:10,148
That hurt me.

1150
01:16:11,429 --> 01:16:13,403
That's why I said
what I said today.

1151
01:16:15,237 --> 01:16:16,862
I've seen some shit today...

1152
01:16:18,949 --> 01:16:21,053
makes me think about life.

1153
01:16:22,532 --> 01:16:25,248
You're one of the best things
in mine.

1154
01:16:27,779 --> 01:16:30,233
So even though
it's some next man's baby...

1155
01:16:32,162 --> 01:16:33,754
I wanna be with you.

1156
01:16:34,882 --> 01:16:36,823
And I wanna look after
you both.

1157
01:16:36,993 --> 01:16:38,814
I wanna change for you.

1158
01:16:40,897 --> 01:16:42,107
Because...

1159
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:48,763
I love you.

1160
01:16:51,775 --> 01:16:53,790
Why you laughing?
I said I love you.

1161
01:16:53,791 --> 01:16:56,823
- Trevor, I never slept with Sam.
- What?

1162
01:16:56,927 --> 01:16:58,487
I've been trying to tell you.

1163
01:16:58,942 --> 01:17:01,565
He lied. He told everyone
I went to his house.

1164
01:17:01,566 --> 01:17:02,525
He said I might as well go...

1165
01:17:02,526 --> 01:17:04,183
because he was gonna
tell everyone he fucked me, but...

1166
01:17:05,053 --> 01:17:07,092
I never, I swear.

1167
01:17:07,837 --> 01:17:09,178
So, the baby...

1168
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:12,979
You're the only one I've slept with.
It's yours.

1169
01:17:15,484 --> 01:17:17,174
- What's wrong?
- Shit.

1170
01:17:18,235 --> 01:17:21,267
- My mum's gonna kill me, man.
- Mine too.

1171
01:17:37,913 --> 01:17:41,076
Listen, listen, we're gonna work, yeah?
We'll stay together forever.

1172
01:17:42,263 --> 01:17:43,823
I'm not sure we will...

1173
01:17:44,151 --> 01:17:47,314
but we're gonna have this baby,
so, we should try.

1174
01:17:50,550 --> 01:17:52,273
Yeah, pussyhole, what now?

1175
01:17:52,470 --> 01:17:54,062
- You think you're a man? Get up.
- Sam don't!

1176
01:17:54,294 --> 01:17:57,043
No... you think you're bad?
You wanna act like a big man?

1177
01:17:57,493 --> 01:17:59,859
I'm gonna beat you
like a fucking big man!

1178
01:18:00,117 --> 01:18:04,207
Where's your two boys? Because you
three pussyholes are finished tonight!

1179
01:18:06,452 --> 01:18:08,147
We can work something out,
I swear to you.

1180
01:18:08,148 --> 01:18:09,172
Fuck...

1181
01:18:09,172 --> 01:18:12,270
- Sam, man, fucking hell, what you doing?
- Shut the fuck up!

1182
01:18:20,914 --> 01:18:24,874
Moony! Jay, look, Sam's beating up
Trife outside, right now!

1183
01:18:26,961 --> 01:18:30,384
- So, what, are you gonna back us or what?
- No, he's your mate, blood.

1184
01:18:30,385 --> 01:18:31,148
You pussy!

1185
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:32,933
You must have lost
your fucking mind fucking with me.

1186
01:18:33,168 --> 01:18:34,858
We can work something, I swear to you.
Hey, Jay, don't, man.

1187
01:18:34,928 --> 01:18:36,782
Hey, blood,
get the fuck off him, man.

1188
01:18:41,999 --> 01:18:42,892
I'm sorry.

1189
01:18:43,727 --> 01:18:45,450
Come on then... Come, come.

1190
01:18:45,678 --> 01:18:46,921
Hey, low it, man, low it.

1191
01:18:49,134 --> 01:18:50,627
Yeah, you are.

1192
01:18:54,637 --> 01:18:57,865
You wanna disrespect my mum?
You wanna fuck my girl?

1193
01:19:05,419 --> 01:19:07,906
You're not fucking real,
blood, you hear me?

1194
01:19:08,650 --> 01:19:10,275
Stay down!

1195
01:19:10,507 --> 01:19:11,935
All you fucking pussyholes, yeah.

1196
01:19:12,010 --> 01:19:13,864
Any of you fuck with me, this is what
you get, you understand, blood?

1197
01:19:14,058 --> 01:19:15,999
Just leave us alone, Sam.

1198
01:19:16,298 --> 01:19:18,185
Everyone knows
you never fucked me.

1199
01:19:18,409 --> 01:19:20,415
What are you gonna do,
beat us all up?

1200
01:19:20,649 --> 01:19:22,056
Who'd wanna fuck you anyway?
Look at you.

1201
01:19:22,057 --> 01:19:24,325

Get down on your fucking knees now.
Put your head on the stone. Fucking cry!

Sam says he's gonna fucking kill me,

1236
01:21:49,171 --> 01:21:51,210
I'm not even... fuck...

Anything's better than here.
And it fucking goes on, you cunt.

She was fucking fifteen, man.

- She was fucking fifteen.

1240
01:21:59,633 --> 01:22:02,479
Give me one fucking good reason why
I shouldn't fucking blow your head off.

1241

You give me one.
Why you shouldn't die.

Give me one fucking reason

1243
01:22:09,584 --> 01:22:11,077
Because he's not worth it.

Baby, baby, it's really bad!

He's stopped breathing! What?
Man, where's the doctor?
