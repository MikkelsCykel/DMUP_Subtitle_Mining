1
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:18,490
Keep her straight...
level.

2
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:20,770
It's your first time up, so
don't do anything interesting.

3
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:22,771
- Who me?
- Yeah, you.

4
00:01:22,852 --> 00:01:24,851
Remember, she stalls out
at about 100.

5
00:01:24,971 --> 00:01:28,212
Keep the air speed up,
otherwise you'll be drifting all over.

6
00:01:28,292 --> 00:01:31,933
- If the ailerons start to shimmy...
- I've flown a plane or two.

7
00:01:32,053 --> 00:01:35,252
Not like this one.
This one's a handful.

8
00:01:35,373 --> 00:01:38,374
You sneeze and you'll end up
upside down in a field.

9
00:01:39,934 --> 00:01:43,134
- That's fresh paint, damn it!
- Do you want me to crash?

10
00:01:43,254 --> 00:01:46,775
Gum ain't gonna keep
your butt in the air.

11
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:53,697
Treat her nice, Clifford. She's gonna
take us all the way to the nationals.

12
00:01:55,297 --> 00:01:58,098
- Let's make some history.
- Yeah.

13
00:02:00,858 --> 00:02:03,938
Crank her up, Goose!

14
00:02:06,699 --> 00:02:10,259
- Make her hot!
- Hot and brakes.

15
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:02,440
Watch this, Peevy!

16
00:04:14,163 --> 00:04:16,843
National air race
is our next stop!

17
00:04:42,329 --> 00:04:44,769
You tryin' to save ammo?
Nail 'em!

18
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:47,849
I can't get a clean shot. Wish that
black-and-white would get out of the way.

19
00:04:55,651 --> 00:04:58,691
Careful what
you wish for.

20
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:39,379
This is the 3rd car
in a month. Hoover'll be spittin' nails.

21
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:41,300
The heck with Hoover!

22
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:59,382
- Outta my way. I can't see.
- Keep drivin'!

23
00:05:59,502 --> 00:06:02,143
Quit movin'. You're
ruining my shot!

24
00:06:02,263 --> 00:06:04,463
Get back.
Get...

25
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:23,067
Let's go, Lenny.
We can't get caught with...

26
00:06:23,787 --> 00:06:26,107
Lousy feds!

27
00:06:34,909 --> 00:06:37,229
Somethin' ain't right.

28
00:06:43,351 --> 00:06:45,471
Sorry, Lenny.

29
00:06:59,914 --> 00:07:01,634
He's gettin' away.

30
00:07:23,118 --> 00:07:24,998
Get it off!

31
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:27,838
- Get him out!
- Peevy!

32
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,600
Hit the latch!
Hurry!

33
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,680
Get the hell
outta there!

34
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,960
Where you goin'?
Cliff!

35
00:07:38,361 --> 00:07:40,561
You all right?
You okay?

36
00:07:47,882 --> 00:07:50,764
Well... that's
the end of that!

37
00:07:52,203 --> 00:07:55,485
- All right, get it outta here.
- Wait a minute.

38
00:07:55,564 --> 00:07:58,164
You chase crooks
across our runway,

39
00:07:58,284 --> 00:08:00,245
crash into my pilot,
and it's our fault?

40
00:08:00,365 --> 00:08:03,526
No offence, pops, but we
got more important things...

41
00:08:03,607 --> 00:08:06,006
- than get all sweaty about whose fault it was.
- Listen, buddy,

42
00:08:06,126 --> 00:08:08,927
building that plane took three years
and every cent we had.

43
00:08:09,007 --> 00:08:11,207
File a claim with Uncle Sam.
You could get lucky.

44
00:08:11,287 --> 00:08:15,447
And wait six months... a year?
We made a livin' with that plane.

45
00:08:15,567 --> 00:08:18,368
Well maybe it's time
to get a real job.

46
00:08:20,329 --> 00:08:24,249
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Relax! Relax!

47
00:08:24,369 --> 00:08:26,289
You got that one
free, kid.

48
00:08:26,409 --> 00:08:28,890
- One more and you'll be eatin' soft food for a month!
- Yeah?

49
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,011
- Relax.
- That fly boy hangs one...

50
00:08:31,091 --> 00:08:33,051
on my kisser and
you let him waltz?

51
00:08:33,171 --> 00:08:36,252
Maybe you
had it comin'.

52
00:08:38,331 --> 00:08:41,453
- We need a word with the patient.
- In private.

53
00:08:44,334 --> 00:08:47,013
Your buddy's getting fitted
for a pine overcoat.

54
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:51,775
If you make it to County General,
Alcatraz is your new digs.

55
00:08:51,896 --> 00:08:54,096
Spit it out, Wilmer.
Where's the package?

56
00:08:54,175 --> 00:08:57,656
Blown to hell.

57
00:08:57,776 --> 00:09:00,216
Why don't you
go look for it?

58
00:09:00,336 --> 00:09:04,497
- Get him outta here.
- Hey, Fitch?

59
00:09:07,498 --> 00:09:11,058
Take a look at this.

60
00:09:12,538 --> 00:09:15,219
That must be the gizmo, all right.

61
00:09:15,339 --> 00:09:17,259
Okay, button it up.

62
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:20,780
- Call 'im, Wooly.
- Why me? I called last time.

63
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:24,220
But he likes you.

64
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:29,262
There's no mistake
about that, Wooly?

65
00:09:29,342 --> 00:09:32,623
- I'm afraid not. We got what's left of it.
- I see.

66
00:09:32,702 --> 00:09:35,542
- It was damn sloppy.
- It could've been worse. We got the gizmo.

67
00:09:35,664 --> 00:09:39,703
- Yes, it could have.
- We'll take it down to headquarters.

68
00:09:39,783 --> 00:09:42,744
Was that Wolinski?

69
00:09:42,824 --> 00:09:46,425
They chased it to an
airstrip in the valley.

70
00:09:46,504 --> 00:09:49,306
There was a wreck
on the runway.

71
00:09:49,385 --> 00:09:52,066
The X-3 was destroyed.

72
00:09:52,185 --> 00:09:54,427
Better lost than
in the wrong hands.

73
00:09:54,547 --> 00:09:59,667
- How soon can you rebuild it?
- Rebuild it?

74
00:09:59,788 --> 00:10:01,667
Not a chance.

75
00:10:01,787 --> 00:10:05,308
My people in Washington will have
something to say about that.

76
00:10:05,429 --> 00:10:09,469
Your people in Washington want to turn
anything that flies into a weapon.

77
00:10:09,589 --> 00:10:11,509
Apparently someone else
had the same idea.

78
00:10:11,629 --> 00:10:14,710
I'm afraid
we must insist.

79
00:10:14,789 --> 00:10:17,070
I don't work
for the government.

80
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:20,391
I cooperate
at my discretion.

81
00:10:20,512 --> 00:10:23,311
Two of my best pilots were
killed during the test phase.

82
00:10:23,392 --> 00:10:26,753
God knows how many more men
would have died if it had flown.

83
00:10:26,873 --> 00:10:30,352
No, gentlemen.

84
00:10:30,433 --> 00:10:33,073
I'm sorry I ever dreamed
the damn thing up.

85
00:10:34,194 --> 00:10:37,155
Sir, I wish
you'd reconsider.

86
00:10:37,274 --> 00:10:39,875
What do we tell
the president?

87
00:10:39,996 --> 00:10:44,315
Tell him
the dream is over.

88
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:48,317
Tell him
Howard Hughes said so.

89
00:10:49,796 --> 00:10:52,557
What's this 300 gallons here?

90
00:10:52,677 --> 00:10:54,758
We don't burn that much fuel
in two years!

91
00:10:54,878 --> 00:10:59,039
You burned it in two seconds when my
fuel truck went up. It's all itemized.

92
00:10:59,119 --> 00:11:01,879
I didn't blow up your truck.
The guy in the car did.

93
00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:04,000
After bouncing
off you.

94
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,560
Pilots are responsible
for a safe landing.

95
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,881
Where we gonna get this kind of dough?
We've gotta sell the Gee Bee for scrap!

96
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:13,400
I'm sorry. I hate to
kick you when you're down.

97
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,642
But business is business.
I'm out of pocket here.

98
00:11:17,762 --> 00:11:21,202
Of course, I could always
use the old clown act.

99
00:11:21,322 --> 00:11:23,922
We don't do the clown act
no more.

100
00:11:24,043 --> 00:11:25,924
Peevy, it's worth
fifteen bucks a shot.

101
00:11:26,004 --> 00:11:29,524
10 bucks a shot;
5 bucks goes toward your bill.

102
00:11:29,645 --> 00:11:33,244
Think it over. See it my way
or see me in court.

103
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:36,045
The clown suit is
in the storeroom.

104
00:11:36,165 --> 00:11:39,527
First show's at nine.
Don't be late.

105
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:44,086
Lousy nickel-nurser.

106
00:11:44,207 --> 00:11:46,847
Clown act!

107
00:11:46,927 --> 00:11:50,527
Good thinkin', Clifford!
You just set us back four years.

108
00:11:50,607 --> 00:11:54,169
Plus which "Miss Mabel" here
is a flying coffin.

109
00:11:54,289 --> 00:11:57,489
She never let us down before.
I'll go real easy on her.

110
00:11:57,609 --> 00:12:02,010
Number five piston is shot,
nothing left but spit and wire.

111
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:03,850
I could fly a shoe box
if it had wings, Peev.

112
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,211
- Ouch!
- What's the matter?

113
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:09,611
There's somethin'
under this seat.

114
00:12:14,012 --> 00:12:16,893
That's my
duffel bag.

115
00:12:17,013 --> 00:12:20,613
- What've you got in there?
- I don't know, but it's heavy.

116
00:12:20,694 --> 00:12:23,894
- Peev, clean that table off.
- All right.

117
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,176
Open her up.

118
00:12:42,218 --> 00:12:46,058
Oh, my!
What've we got here?

119
00:12:46,138 --> 00:12:47,979
Take the bag.

120
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:57,100
- That's a piece of work, isn't it?
- Yeah.

121
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,460
What do you suppose it is,
a bomb or somethin'?

122
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:01,541
Too complex
to be a bomb.

123
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,302
I don't see
any moving parts.

124
00:13:04,422 --> 00:13:06,542
I wouldn't touch that
if I were you.

125
00:13:31,547 --> 00:13:33,907
- The housing's still cool.
- Huh.

126
00:13:33,987 --> 00:13:38,069
Runs on alcohol.

127
00:13:38,188 --> 00:13:40,509
What's the damn thing for?

128
00:13:40,629 --> 00:13:43,189
- Hold it, Peev.
- Huh?

129
00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:45,109
Hold it!

130
00:14:08,673 --> 00:14:10,514
Tip her over. Tip her over.

131
00:14:10,593 --> 00:14:12,435
- Easy, easy!
- I got it.

132
00:14:14,115 --> 00:14:17,115
Watch it.

133
00:14:23,397 --> 00:14:26,437
What's goin' on, Sinclair?
Lenny is dead.

134
00:14:26,557 --> 00:14:29,437
Wilmer's wrapped up like
a mummy in County General.

135
00:14:29,518 --> 00:14:33,398
You didn't
play straight with me.

136
00:14:34,758 --> 00:14:37,719
I'm sorry about your boys,
Eddie... truly.

137
00:14:37,798 --> 00:14:42,240
- What went wrong?
- It's the feds that went wrong.

138
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,920
This was supposed to be a simple
snatch-and-grab. What the hell is going on?

139
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,320
I didn't say
it'd be simple.

140
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,642
Snatch-and-grab is what
you're supposed to be good at.

141
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:54,082
That's what I pay you for.

142
00:14:54,202 --> 00:14:56,124
Now where's the package?

143
00:14:56,243 --> 00:14:58,123
Nothing's gonna happen
until you tell me...

144
00:14:58,243 --> 00:15:00,764
why this merchandise is
so important to the feds.

145
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:07,804
Send me a cheque.

146
00:15:07,925 --> 00:15:11,206
- Let's get out of here, boys.
- It's a rocket.

147
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:16,086
A rocket?

148
00:15:18,246 --> 00:15:21,567
Yeah...
Like in the comic books.

149
00:15:24,127 --> 00:15:27,409
- What happened to it?
- I don't know.

150
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:30,129
Wilmer knows. He's in
the hospital surrounded by cops.

151
00:15:30,249 --> 00:15:32,849
- In a couple of days...
- We don't have a couple of days.

152
00:15:32,969 --> 00:15:38,091
What room's Wilmer in?

153
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:42,371
Mr Movie Star!

154
00:15:42,451 --> 00:15:46,091
He's gonna walk in with a smile
on his face and a handful of posies.

155
00:15:46,212 --> 00:15:49,053
He's gonna charm
the feds to death.

156
00:15:53,493 --> 00:15:55,573
That's not exactly
what I had in mind.

157
00:15:55,693 --> 00:15:58,333
Who cares what
you had in mind?

158
00:15:58,414 --> 00:16:01,494
You don't need
my services any more.

159
00:16:01,615 --> 00:16:03,855
You can take it from here.
I'll tell you what.

160
00:16:03,975 --> 00:16:06,896
You pay me what you owe me
'cause you're half lunatic.

161
00:16:09,376 --> 00:16:11,257
Yes, shoot!

162
00:16:11,377 --> 00:16:16,457
I want that rocket, Eddie, not
next week, not tomorrow... now.

163
00:16:16,577 --> 00:16:18,978
We have a deal?

164
00:16:27,099 --> 00:16:31,340
You bring me that rocket
and I'll double your price.

165
00:16:40,102 --> 00:16:44,142
You'll triple my price.

166
00:16:51,024 --> 00:16:54,545
What's a movie star
need a rocket for anyway?

167
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:03,186
Bloody amateurs!

168
00:17:25,751 --> 00:17:27,591
Yes.

169
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:31,391
Lothar,
I've got another job for you...

170
00:17:31,512 --> 00:17:34,192
a condolence call.

171
00:17:43,673 --> 00:17:46,673
Come on, Peev.

172
00:17:55,315 --> 00:17:58,677
Here goes.

173
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:13,359
Well, I'm lookin' at it
but I don't believe it.

174
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,682
- Peevy... the stake!
- Get down!

175
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,722
That thing'll
cut you in half.

176
00:18:34,682 --> 00:18:37,244
We lost it.

177
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:39,604
I told you I should have
tested it myself.

178
00:18:39,684 --> 00:18:44,366
Yeah, you'd be halfway
to Kansas by now, chowder head!

179
00:19:07,289 --> 00:19:10,290
Turn her off!
Turn her off!

180
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:15,290
That must've woke up
the whole valley.

181
00:19:15,371 --> 00:19:17,211
Pick her up.
Let's get out of here.

182
00:19:21,173 --> 00:19:24,933
- Peevy, you'd pay to see a man fly, wouldn't you?
- Ha!

183
00:19:25,052 --> 00:19:28,933
- You've gotta be outta your mind.
- I'm talkin' about making real money.

184
00:19:29,013 --> 00:19:33,014
Not just 10 bucks a show but enough to get
us back on our feet and into the nationals.

185
00:19:33,134 --> 00:19:37,095
Are your eyes painted on? This thing is
like strapping nitroglycerine to your back.

186
00:19:37,215 --> 00:19:40,295
- The feds are mixed up in this.
- I don't want to keep it.

187
00:19:40,376 --> 00:19:42,615
I just want to borrow it
for a while.

188
00:19:42,696 --> 00:19:45,777
When you borrow something and don't
tell nobody, they call that stealing.

189
00:19:45,896 --> 00:19:49,698
As soon as we can afford
a new plane, we'll give it back.

190
00:19:49,817 --> 00:19:52,497
Did you see what
this thing did back there?

191
00:19:52,617 --> 00:19:56,579
You're always telling me what
a genius you are! Fix it.

192
00:19:58,619 --> 00:20:00,498
We're gonna need
one hell of a lawyer.

193
00:20:05,261 --> 00:20:08,781
I think we're gonna
need a helmet.

194
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:11,622
# You're a
sweet little headache #

195
00:20:11,701 --> 00:20:15,502
# But you are
lots of fun #

196
00:20:15,622 --> 00:20:18,583
Whose is it?

197
00:20:18,703 --> 00:20:21,023
Yours.

198
00:20:36,946 --> 00:20:38,786
'Evening, Miss Pye.

199
00:20:38,866 --> 00:20:41,746
You know my rules;
no gentlemen after 6:00 p. m.

200
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:45,548
- Well, I'm no gentleman.
- You can say that again.

201
00:20:47,028 --> 00:20:48,829
- Hello.
- Hi.

202
00:20:48,948 --> 00:20:51,468
- Good night, Mrs Pye.
- Have a good time.

203
00:20:51,549 --> 00:20:54,549
If he tries anything, deck him.
Don't forget the curfew.

204
00:20:54,669 --> 00:20:59,150
- I lock up at 11:00 sharp.
- Yes, warden.

205
00:20:59,271 --> 00:21:01,750
Guess what?
I think I got the part.

206
00:21:01,871 --> 00:21:04,071
- That's great.
- I won't know for sure 'til tomorrow,

207
00:21:04,152 --> 00:21:06,512
but the director said he
liked my reading the best.

208
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:09,673
- You have lines this time.
- Just one.

209
00:21:09,752 --> 00:21:12,793
- But it's to Neville Sinclair.
- Okay!

210
00:21:12,913 --> 00:21:15,033
Let's hear it.

211
00:21:15,154 --> 00:21:17,193
"Oh, my prince.

212
00:21:17,273 --> 00:21:21,434
Would that you'd
drink of my lips as deeply. "

213
00:21:21,554 --> 00:21:24,275
And then he kisses you?

214
00:21:24,355 --> 00:21:27,235
No. He's too busy
killing someone.

215
00:21:27,355 --> 00:21:30,315
- Now you tell me.
- What?

216
00:21:30,396 --> 00:21:33,237
The maiden voyage.
How'd she fly?

217
00:21:33,316 --> 00:21:36,797
She flew great.
Landing had a few bumps.

218
00:21:36,917 --> 00:21:40,118
We'd better scram if we're
gonna catch this Cagney movie.

219
00:21:40,197 --> 00:21:42,199
Uh-uh-uh.
It's my turn to pick.

220
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:44,119
Uh-oh.

221
00:21:44,199 --> 00:21:46,039
There's a new
Neville Sinclair movie.

222
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:48,119
Oh, Jen, you know
Cagney's better.

223
00:21:48,199 --> 00:21:51,159
You won't catch Cagney
lounging around his penthouse,

224
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,920
walking poodles in the park,
or doing any of...

225
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,601
Or getting shot down
behind enemy lines?

226
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,960
- What are you talking about?
- The movie,

227
00:21:59,042 --> 00:22:01,082
"Wings of Honour. "

228
00:22:01,203 --> 00:22:03,643
- Neville Sinclair?
- Uh-huh.

229
00:22:03,762 --> 00:22:05,563
Oh, brother.

230
00:22:05,683 --> 00:22:07,883
This I gotta see.

231
00:22:08,004 --> 00:22:12,244
Hitler assures the western powers he is
not massing troops at the Czech border.

232
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:14,445
Here comes the Fuehrer's latest
symbol of German progress,

233
00:22:14,525 --> 00:22:17,725
the airship "Luxembourg,"
beginning its American tour...

234
00:22:17,845 --> 00:22:19,845
- to promote world peace.
- World peace!

235
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:21,846
What he means is
a piece of the world!

236
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:23,806
Excuse me.

237
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:26,927
...on the first stop
of their goodwill tour.

238
00:22:27,006 --> 00:22:30,968
- Their last goodwill tour buried half of Europe.
- Shh.

239
00:22:31,047 --> 00:22:33,448
Though filled with
explosive hydrogen...

240
00:22:33,568 --> 00:22:37,489
Your Gee Bee could fly
circles around that thing.

241
00:22:39,328 --> 00:22:42,448
After the short visit, it was
into the clouds to continue a journey...

242
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:45,050
that will carry the "Luxembourg"
to Chicago, St. Louis,

243
00:22:45,171 --> 00:22:48,090
across the Rockies...
and finally to Los Angeles.

244
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:50,611
Look us up, boys,
when you get to Hollywood.

245
00:23:37,861 --> 00:23:41,579
Who's there?
Who is it?

246
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:45,942
- What do you want?
- Where is it?

247
00:23:46,062 --> 00:23:49,421
- Where's what?
- The rocket.

248
00:23:49,541 --> 00:23:52,102
I don't answer to nobody
but Eddie Valentine.

249
00:23:55,022 --> 00:23:57,064
Okay, okay!
Ease off!

250
00:23:57,142 --> 00:24:00,344
I pulled a switch. I got
the package stashed real good.

251
00:24:00,464 --> 00:24:03,624
It's at the airfield, hangar 3.
It's in some old plane.

252
00:24:21,508 --> 00:24:24,108
- Hey, open this door.
- Are you okay?

253
00:24:25,548 --> 00:24:28,430
What is it? What happened?

254
00:24:47,312 --> 00:24:49,873
And then,

255
00:24:49,993 --> 00:24:51,913
get this, fellas,
at the end of the movie...

256
00:24:51,993 --> 00:24:54,834
he flies over enemy trenches
and drops a bottle of champagne.

257
00:24:54,955 --> 00:24:58,755
And let me guess. It hits the general
and we win the war.

258
00:24:58,876 --> 00:25:00,795
It was symbolic.
He was being chivalrous.

259
00:25:00,915 --> 00:25:03,276
Where'd he
get the champagne?

260
00:25:03,356 --> 00:25:07,637
- They didn't have liquor stores at the front, did they?
- Not that I recall.

261
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,677
It doesn't matter where he got it.

262
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:12,358
That's not the point.
It's just...

263
00:25:12,478 --> 00:25:14,998
Forget it.

264
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:19,159
Malcolm,
the wheel came off.

265
00:25:19,239 --> 00:25:22,679
Oh, let me see,
princess.

266
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,521
Sure, we'll fix her up.

267
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,841
Did I ever tell you about the time
I got shot down by the Red Baron?

268
00:25:30,521 --> 00:25:33,161
No?

269
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:36,282
There I was flying over
the Ardennes on patrol...

270
00:25:36,402 --> 00:25:39,482
when he comes screaming
out of the sun, guns blazing.

271
00:25:39,562 --> 00:25:43,203
And then, smack!

272
00:25:45,363 --> 00:25:48,844
- Bull's-eye, ace.
- I'm sorry, Jenny.

273
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:51,004
It's okay, Malcolm.

274
00:25:51,084 --> 00:25:54,886
Thanks, Cliff.

275
00:25:56,445 --> 00:25:58,246
You know, Cliff,

276
00:25:58,366 --> 00:26:02,487
it wouldn't hurt to try someplace new...
away from the airfield.

277
00:26:02,568 --> 00:26:05,888
Like where? The Copa?
The Brown Derby?

278
00:26:05,968 --> 00:26:07,967
Why not the South Seas Club
while you're dreamin'.

279
00:26:08,087 --> 00:26:10,808
Okay, how 'bout this.

280
00:26:10,888 --> 00:26:13,248
We'll go have a real night
on the town...

281
00:26:13,369 --> 00:26:15,368
after you win
the nationals.

282
00:26:15,489 --> 00:26:19,010
Yeah, swell,
after I win the nationals.

283
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:21,810
You gonna fly
in the nationals after all?

284
00:26:21,931 --> 00:26:24,411
Glad to hear it after
that landing today.

285
00:26:24,492 --> 00:26:28,291
How about a warm-up, Malcolm?

286
00:26:28,371 --> 00:26:30,372
You said there were
a few bumps.

287
00:26:30,452 --> 00:26:34,373
Boy, I'll say. She folded like a kite
when she hit the runway.

288
00:26:34,452 --> 00:26:37,733
We thought Cliffie's number
was up, with the fire and all.

289
00:26:43,654 --> 00:26:45,574
I was gonna tell ya.

290
00:26:47,695 --> 00:26:49,735
I didn't want to ruin
your evening.

291
00:26:49,815 --> 00:26:53,177
It's very thoughtful of you.
You'd rather make a fool of me?

292
00:26:54,775 --> 00:26:56,617
I'm sorry.

293
00:26:56,697 --> 00:26:59,778
I don't want you
to be sorry.

294
00:26:59,858 --> 00:27:03,938
I want you to stop treating me
like... a stranger.

295
00:27:04,058 --> 00:27:06,739
When something goes wrong,
I should be the first to know.

296
00:27:06,859 --> 00:27:09,579
I shouldn't be
the last.

297
00:27:09,699 --> 00:27:12,580
Everyone knows because
they were at the airfield.

298
00:27:14,499 --> 00:27:16,740
I had an audition.

299
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,661
It was important to me.

300
00:27:18,781 --> 00:27:20,902
I understand.

301
00:27:21,021 --> 00:27:22,982
Just like the last time
when I flew the regionals.

302
00:27:23,102 --> 00:27:26,383
You got a big part. You stood
behind Myrna Loy with a bowl of grapes.

303
00:27:28,943 --> 00:27:32,264
Good night, Millie.
Thank you for the soup.

304
00:27:33,583 --> 00:27:36,023
Well,

305
00:27:36,144 --> 00:27:38,344
go after her,
you dope.

306
00:27:41,145 --> 00:27:42,986
Jenny!

307
00:27:50,268 --> 00:27:53,028
Cliff,
I, uh...

308
00:27:53,108 --> 00:27:57,428
- I'm sorry, I really stuck...
- Malcolm, it's okay.

309
00:27:57,548 --> 00:27:59,828
It's not your fault.

310
00:28:18,311 --> 00:28:21,953
- Did you have a good time?
- Yeah.

311
00:28:22,073 --> 00:28:24,954
Go ahead and stick that
welding torch in my ear.

312
00:28:25,074 --> 00:28:28,194
We'll call it the end
of a perfect day.

313
00:28:30,315 --> 00:28:33,836
What're you two
scrappin' about this time?

314
00:28:33,916 --> 00:28:35,755
I don't know, Peev.

315
00:28:35,835 --> 00:28:37,995
I just can't figure
this girl out.

316
00:28:38,076 --> 00:28:40,916
She hangs around with
this Hollywood crowd all day,

317
00:28:40,997 --> 00:28:43,597
talkin' about movie stars
and nightclubs...

318
00:28:43,676 --> 00:28:45,837
That's her work. She don't care
about them phoney-baloneys.

319
00:28:45,917 --> 00:28:47,758
She cares about you.

320
00:28:47,837 --> 00:28:50,997
I want her to think
I'm makin' something of myself,

321
00:28:51,117 --> 00:28:53,759
Not that I'm just
an out-of-work pilot.

322
00:28:53,879 --> 00:28:56,079
You got a good thing
goin' with that girl.

323
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:58,080
If she flies the coop,
I'm tellin' you...

324
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,560
it's gonna be
your fault.

325
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,280
What do you know
about women, Peev?

326
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:08,361
You haven't had a date
since 1932.

327
00:29:08,482 --> 00:29:11,043
Flora Maxwell.

328
00:29:11,162 --> 00:29:15,282
There was no point
in datin' nobody after her.

329
00:29:46,849 --> 00:29:48,889
He's got to be kidding!

330
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,970
Ha, ha, ha.

331
00:30:04,051 --> 00:30:07,453
What? Kill me as I stand?
I thought you were a sporting man.

332
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:11,933
True. I'd hate to stain my
legend on a villain such as you.

333
00:30:19,815 --> 00:30:23,175
Prepare to die that we may learn
the identity of the Laughing Bandit.

334
00:30:24,056 --> 00:30:27,136
Why wait?

335
00:30:27,256 --> 00:30:29,777
Good heavens!
It's Sir Reginald!

336
00:30:29,896 --> 00:30:32,698
None other!

337
00:30:41,979 --> 00:30:44,379
Oh, my prince,

338
00:30:44,459 --> 00:30:47,019
would that you'd drink
of my lips as deeply.

339
00:30:47,139 --> 00:30:51,981
Cut! Cut! Cut!
Back to first positions.

340
00:30:55,821 --> 00:30:58,783
Good lord! How many times
are we gonna have to do this?

341
00:30:58,863 --> 00:31:02,662
Sweetheart, acting is acting
like you're not acting.

342
00:31:02,782 --> 00:31:06,903
- So act... but don't act like you're acting.
- All right.

343
00:31:09,904 --> 00:31:13,985
Is she a block of wood!
Your audition was better.

344
00:31:14,065 --> 00:31:18,025
Everybody's was better! Does it matter
when you're the producer's niece?

345
00:31:18,145 --> 00:31:21,187
She gets a scene with Neville Sinclair
and we play scenery.

346
00:31:21,266 --> 00:31:24,586
- I love Hollywood.
- Everybody, positions.

347
00:31:24,666 --> 00:31:27,187
Let's try to get it
right this time.

348
00:31:27,308 --> 00:31:30,507
"Laughing Bandit,"
scene 114, take 28.

349
00:31:30,588 --> 00:31:32,947
And... action!

350
00:31:33,068 --> 00:31:35,829
Ha-ha-ha.

351
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:41,510
What?
Kill me as I stand?

352
00:31:41,589 --> 00:31:43,510
I thought you were
a sporting man.

353
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:47,631
I'd hate to stain my legend
on a villain such as you.

354
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:53,112
Prepare to die that we may learn
the identity of the Laughing Bandit.

355
00:31:53,232 --> 00:31:56,913
- Why wait?
- It's Sir Reginald!

356
00:31:59,393 --> 00:32:01,673
None other.

357
00:32:05,074 --> 00:32:09,195
Oh, my prince, would that
you'd drink of my lips as deeply.

358
00:32:25,398 --> 00:32:28,118
Excuse me. I'm looking
for Jenny Blake.

359
00:32:28,238 --> 00:32:31,319
Oh, Jenny...
Jenny Blake.

360
00:32:31,439 --> 00:32:35,560
Does anyone know
a Jenny Blake?

361
00:32:35,641 --> 00:32:37,121
Cut.

362
00:32:37,241 --> 00:32:39,161
- I hope he's okay.
- Where's Mr Sinclair?

363
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,441
Give us a hand
with this flat.

364
00:32:41,562 --> 00:32:46,122
- You okay, Mr Sinclair?
- I'm fine.

365
00:32:46,203 --> 00:32:50,202
Never let it be said Neville Sinclair
failed to bring down the house.

366
00:32:50,322 --> 00:32:54,004
Somebody call the nurse!
Charlie's been stabbed!

367
00:32:55,563 --> 00:32:57,405
Charlie!

368
00:32:57,525 --> 00:32:59,445
Charlie.

369
00:32:59,565 --> 00:33:02,285
Forgive me, Charlie.
I had no idea.

370
00:33:02,365 --> 00:33:05,205
Did you think I was
stealing the scene?

371
00:33:05,285 --> 00:33:07,645
Don't talk.
Don't even move.

372
00:33:07,765 --> 00:33:11,007
Get my car and driver.
Get him to The Queen of Angels.

373
00:33:11,127 --> 00:33:14,007
Gladys, ride with him. I'll have
my personal physician meet you.

374
00:33:14,127 --> 00:33:16,488
Victor, come here.

375
00:33:16,609 --> 00:33:19,928
This is supposed to be
a closed set... no visitors!

376
00:33:20,048 --> 00:33:23,449
I want that... Jenny
banned from the lot.

377
00:33:26,569 --> 00:33:28,410
Jenny, I said I'm sorry.

378
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:31,490
- I just want to patch things up.
- You're off to a great start.

379
00:33:31,611 --> 00:33:35,091
Something really big has happened
and I want you to be the first to know.

380
00:33:35,172 --> 00:33:37,531
Me and Peevy
found something...

381
00:33:37,612 --> 00:33:39,772
that's gonna get us
back on our feet.

382
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:43,213
- What do you mean, found something?
- It's an engine...

383
00:33:43,333 --> 00:33:45,653
But you strap it to your back...

384
00:33:45,734 --> 00:33:48,334
and it makes you fly
without wings.

385
00:33:48,454 --> 00:33:52,294
You knocked down half
the castle to tell me about an engine?

386
00:33:52,414 --> 00:33:54,775
You're always saying
you're the last to know.

387
00:33:54,854 --> 00:33:57,855
Cliff, I meant
the important things.

388
00:33:57,935 --> 00:34:00,616
- This is important.
- So is this acting job.

389
00:34:00,736 --> 00:34:03,176
- Acting?
- Yes, acting.

390
00:34:03,297 --> 00:34:05,816
Honey, you're walking
through the scenery.

391
00:34:05,897 --> 00:34:08,057
That's not fair.
This is a good job.

392
00:34:08,137 --> 00:34:10,178
The director thinks
I'm talented.

393
00:34:10,258 --> 00:34:12,258
What's this?

394
00:34:12,339 --> 00:34:14,659
Pay voucher. The director
wants you off the picture.

395
00:34:14,779 --> 00:34:17,980
- You know this is a closed set.
- I have to go.

396
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:20,740
Come on. You know
what a closed set means?

397
00:34:33,062 --> 00:34:35,021
Hey!

398
00:34:57,266 --> 00:35:01,188
- Where's that girl I told you to fire?
- I fired her.

399
00:35:10,709 --> 00:35:13,270
Hello.
I'm Neville Sinclair.

400
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:17,390
- You must be...
- Jenny Blake.

401
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:22,351
I... I'd hate
to think...

402
00:35:22,471 --> 00:35:26,392
that I may have been... I'm responsible
for your having been dismissed.

403
00:35:26,512 --> 00:35:30,633
- Will you stay?
- But it's... really my fault.

404
00:35:30,713 --> 00:35:35,594
Have you read for the part
of the Saxon princess?

405
00:35:35,674 --> 00:35:37,553
No.

406
00:35:37,674 --> 00:35:40,714
I think you might be
wonderful in the role.

407
00:35:40,794 --> 00:35:44,276
I'll see that you do. Perhaps
we could discuss it over dinner.

408
00:35:44,396 --> 00:35:48,076
I've got a table at the South Seas Club
if you're not too bored with the club.

409
00:35:48,196 --> 00:35:52,236
- I'd love to Mr...
- Neville.

410
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:54,478
- Neville.
- Tonight then.

411
00:35:54,558 --> 00:35:59,318
Let's get all the
atmosphere over here.

412
00:36:02,398 --> 00:36:07,279
Ladies in waiting?
We're waiting! Let's go.

413
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,960
Ladies and gentlemen,

414
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:15,121
the Travelair Mystery Ship
has taken over the lead.

415
00:36:15,241 --> 00:36:18,722
We have clocked him at
192 miles per hour.

416
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:22,002
Programmes!
Five cents!

417
00:36:22,083 --> 00:36:25,003
- Here you are.
- Malcolm.

418
00:36:25,083 --> 00:36:27,884
- I sold seven.
- Good. Here's more.

419
00:36:27,964 --> 00:36:30,164
Programmes!
Programmes!

420
00:36:30,244 --> 00:36:33,484
As you can see,
Miss Los Angeles is trailing badly.

421
00:36:33,563 --> 00:36:35,445
She was down with some
mechanical problems...

422
00:36:35,525 --> 00:36:39,445
- and she may be in trouble.
- Park it away from the runway.

423
00:36:39,525 --> 00:36:41,966
- What's wrong with that kid? I told him 9:00.
- He'll be here.

424
00:36:42,045 --> 00:36:44,326
If he ain't in the air
in 5 minutes, find a new hangar.

425
00:36:44,446 --> 00:36:47,807
Howard in the Great Lakes Biplane...

426
00:36:47,928 --> 00:36:51,168
is really pouring it on...
runnin' 3rd but movin'!

427
00:36:51,287 --> 00:36:53,488
This could end up
in a three-way heat.

428
00:36:53,567 --> 00:36:57,489
I know what Wilmer told Sinclair's goon,
but the rocket ain't in hangar three.

429
00:36:57,569 --> 00:37:00,849
There's an old plane
but the only thing in it was this.

430
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:04,530
- That's it?
- We searched this place from hell to breakfast.

431
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:07,771
I want you to start over.
Turn it inside out, upside down.

432
00:37:07,891 --> 00:37:10,331
Keep your eyes open
for this dame.

433
00:37:10,451 --> 00:37:13,653
She might be the one who knows
where this guy is who found our package.

434
00:37:13,772 --> 00:37:15,893
Okay, Eddie.
Let's go.

435
00:37:25,814 --> 00:37:29,415
To dazzle you
with an exhibition of skills...

436
00:37:29,535 --> 00:37:32,735
is Cliff Secord, the Fearless Freep.
And there he goes!

437
00:37:44,138 --> 00:37:45,978
That's not
the routine!

438
00:37:46,057 --> 00:37:48,579
What the hell is
Secord trying to pull?

439
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:53,620
- I'm two minutes late. Who'd you put up in Miss Mabel?
- Five cents!

440
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:57,900
- Get your programme!
- That's gotta be Malcolm.

441
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:01,662
Flag that biplane
down now!

442
00:38:04,342 --> 00:38:07,741
He hasn't been behind the stick
in 25 years. What's he doin'?

443
00:38:07,861 --> 00:38:11,983
Tryin' to save your job. If he drifts into
those race lanes he's gonna kill somebody.

444
00:38:16,223 --> 00:38:17,905
Oh, no.

445
00:38:21,865 --> 00:38:23,745
The rocket's in
the tool chest?

446
00:38:23,825 --> 00:38:26,226
Yeah, why?

447
00:38:34,187 --> 00:38:36,908
We have an emergency.

448
00:38:37,028 --> 00:38:39,748
We have an emergency!
Please clear the field.

449
00:38:39,869 --> 00:38:42,348
- Please clear...
- You outta your mind?

450
00:38:44,109 --> 00:38:48,070
Ladies and gentlemen,
we had you fooled for a minute.

451
00:38:48,189 --> 00:38:50,431
But it's all part
of the show.

452
00:38:56,472 --> 00:38:59,511
Stay in your seats.

453
00:38:59,631 --> 00:39:02,952
- What are you doin'?
- What's it look like? Give me a hand.

454
00:39:03,072 --> 00:39:05,353
No, Cliff, no!
We haven't tested it enough.

455
00:39:05,433 --> 00:39:09,194
- Look what she did to...
- Cut it out! I'm scared enough as it is.

456
00:39:13,034 --> 00:39:16,955
I reworked the throttle, so just
squeeze her like a gas pedal.

457
00:39:17,036 --> 00:39:20,956
- If you want to stop, mash down hard and let go.
- Okay.

458
00:39:21,035 --> 00:39:23,796
- Anything else?
- Yeah.

459
00:39:25,517 --> 00:39:27,598
A little luck.

460
00:39:32,557 --> 00:39:35,118
- How do I look?
- Like a hood ornament.

461
00:39:58,723 --> 00:40:00,842
Look at that!

462
00:40:00,962 --> 00:40:05,124
- Tell me you're gettin' this.
- I don't know what it is, but I'm gettin' it.

463
00:40:09,604 --> 00:40:12,565
- Malcolm!
- Aaah!

464
00:40:17,366 --> 00:40:21,167
Malcolm?

465
00:40:21,247 --> 00:40:24,689
Malcolm,
wake up.

466
00:40:24,768 --> 00:40:28,368
It's me, Cliff.
Wake up! Come on!

467
00:40:29,409 --> 00:40:33,009
Ohh! Whoa!

468
00:40:34,609 --> 00:40:38,131
Don't worry, folks.
It's all part of the show.

469
00:40:51,013 --> 00:40:53,413
Oh, nooo!

470
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:05,494
Malcolm, wake up.

471
00:41:05,614 --> 00:41:07,616
Wake up!

472
00:41:09,056 --> 00:41:11,256
Get up!
Get out of here.

473
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:23,859
It's all part of the show.

474
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:39,061
Ohhh!
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

475
00:41:39,222 --> 00:41:41,822
He's going west!
He's going west!

476
00:41:41,942 --> 00:41:45,222
Go, go, go! Get out of the way!

477
00:41:50,744 --> 00:41:54,063
- Get off the phone!
- You heard me... a flying man!

478
00:41:54,144 --> 00:41:58,264
- Hold the front page!
- I said... a rocket man!

479
00:42:17,509 --> 00:42:19,909
Oh, no!

480
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:29,311
Whoa! Aaah!

481
00:42:31,032 --> 00:42:33,952
Whoa!

482
00:42:41,473 --> 00:42:43,273
Watch it!

483
00:42:48,354 --> 00:42:50,075
Big gopher.

484
00:42:51,596 --> 00:42:53,675
Oh, no!

485
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:18,640
- Cliff!
- Huh?

486
00:43:28,121 --> 00:43:30,562
I like it!

487
00:43:30,642 --> 00:43:32,682
What in the hell
is the matter with you?

488
00:43:32,803 --> 00:43:34,923
Are you trying
to kill yourself?

489
00:43:35,044 --> 00:43:38,484
We don't know how long this thing
stays up, how much fuel's in her...

490
00:43:38,603 --> 00:43:42,485
If you wanna look around you gotta use
your eyeballs. This thing's got a rudder.

491
00:43:42,605 --> 00:43:45,805
If you turn your head,
you change course. Hear what I'm sayin'?

492
00:43:45,885 --> 00:43:49,805
You banged that up good. I don't know
if I'm gonna be able to fix that.

493
00:43:49,925 --> 00:43:52,846
Peevy, you can
fix anything.

494
00:43:52,927 --> 00:43:56,968
Well... uh-oh! We got company.
Must be the news boys.

495
00:43:57,048 --> 00:44:00,088
- You put on quite a show.
- They can't find out who we are.

496
00:44:00,208 --> 00:44:02,048
Whoever owns this is
gonna want it back...

497
00:44:02,168 --> 00:44:04,208
and I'm just gettin'
the hang of it.

498
00:44:09,969 --> 00:44:11,809
- Put it in neutral.
- What?

499
00:44:11,889 --> 00:44:15,850
Put it in neutral!
You steer, I'll push.

500
00:44:32,534 --> 00:44:35,893
Get in the car.

501
00:44:36,014 --> 00:44:38,094
How 'bout
some background on the flyin' man?

502
00:44:38,214 --> 00:44:40,055
- Yeah, give it to us.
- What's his name?

503
00:44:40,175 --> 00:44:43,097
Sorry, boys. It's a trade secret...
all part of the mystery.

504
00:44:43,216 --> 00:44:45,457
- Why don't you call him Rocket Boy?
- That's lousy!

505
00:44:45,577 --> 00:44:48,457
- What about Rocket Man?
- That's worse.

506
00:44:48,537 --> 00:44:50,697
- What about Missile Man?
- That stinks.

507
00:44:50,777 --> 00:44:52,537
Come on, Bigelow,
give us a better name.

508
00:44:52,657 --> 00:44:55,338
How about
Rocketeer?

509
00:44:55,418 --> 00:44:58,699
- Bingo!
- That'll work. Rocketeer it is.

510
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:00,940
Extra, extra!
Man flies without plane!

511
00:45:01,019 --> 00:45:02,900
Extra!
Read all about it!

512
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:05,860
- It's so romantic.
- Bet he's handsome.

513
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:08,060
I wish he'd
rescue me.

514
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:10,101
Extra, extra!

515
00:45:11,581 --> 00:45:16,542
Ready on the set.
Let's go. Let's shoot.

516
00:45:16,662 --> 00:45:20,142
Congratulations, gentlemen.

517
00:45:20,222 --> 00:45:22,624
Thanks to the diligence
of the FBI,

518
00:45:22,744 --> 00:45:25,664
this vacuum cleaner
will not fall into the wrong hands.

519
00:45:34,146 --> 00:45:37,466
Mr Bigelow, FBI.
We'd like a word with you.

520
00:45:49,269 --> 00:45:53,149
- Must be the maid's day off.
- Somebody's been lookin' for something.

521
00:46:01,031 --> 00:46:04,911
Give me some light.

522
00:46:09,312 --> 00:46:11,112
Mother of mercy!

523
00:46:11,232 --> 00:46:13,313
He's been
folded in half.

524
00:46:13,393 --> 00:46:16,913
Looks like he was
writin' something.

525
00:46:21,995 --> 00:46:26,115
1635...

526
00:46:26,235 --> 00:46:29,115
Palm Terrace.

527
00:46:35,077 --> 00:46:38,238
If the vertical thrust
is 1-28 inches per second...

528
00:46:38,317 --> 00:46:41,957
Cliff?

529
00:47:03,281 --> 00:47:06,923
What do you want?

530
00:47:07,043 --> 00:47:09,523
- What are you doin' here? Get out of here.
- Peevy!

531
00:47:11,843 --> 00:47:14,884
Cliff, get me out!

532
00:47:15,004 --> 00:47:17,924
Peevy!

533
00:47:28,366 --> 00:47:31,047
Aaah!

534
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:34,968
Slats, Murphy,
come with us.

535
00:47:36,047 --> 00:47:37,968
Murph, wait here
for the high sign.

536
00:47:39,689 --> 00:47:41,648
Where is it?

537
00:47:43,769 --> 00:47:46,131
Where's what?

538
00:47:46,249 --> 00:47:49,610
The rocket!

539
00:47:51,411 --> 00:47:54,331
Sure you got
the right house?

540
00:47:54,451 --> 00:47:58,292
Secord, Peabody!
Open up! FBI.

541
00:48:02,293 --> 00:48:04,093
Get down!

542
00:48:05,014 --> 00:48:06,894
Let 'em have it, boys.

543
00:48:14,255 --> 00:48:16,695
Cliff?
Cliff!

544
00:48:19,255 --> 00:48:21,695
Cliff?

545
00:48:21,816 --> 00:48:24,176
- Clifford!
- Peevy!

546
00:49:14,786 --> 00:49:17,907
- Hello, Neville.
- Hello, Clark.

547
00:49:21,548 --> 00:49:24,468
# When they begin #

548
00:49:24,588 --> 00:49:27,669
# The beguine #

549
00:49:27,789 --> 00:49:30,069
# It brings back
the sound #

550
00:49:30,189 --> 00:49:33,590
# Of music so tender #

551
00:49:33,711 --> 00:49:39,751
# It brings back the night
of tropical splendour #

552
00:49:39,871 --> 00:49:42,911
# It brings back
a memory #

553
00:49:43,032 --> 00:49:45,913
# And a dream #

554
00:49:46,033 --> 00:49:49,593
Neville...
you old scalawag!

555
00:49:50,993 --> 00:49:52,753
Hello, Bill.
How are you?

556
00:49:52,833 --> 00:49:56,353
Fallen off any
chandeliers lately?

557
00:49:56,474 --> 00:49:58,674
Let me introduce you.
Miss Jenny Blake,

558
00:49:58,755 --> 00:50:00,874
- Mr W. C. Fields.
- Charmed, my dear,

559
00:50:03,035 --> 00:50:04,836
doubly-charmed.

560
00:50:04,956 --> 00:50:10,197
- Jenny... what a euphonious appellation.
- Jenny...

561
00:50:10,277 --> 00:50:14,477
Excuse me for a moment.
I won't be long. Bill, look after her.

562
00:50:14,597 --> 00:50:17,917
I thought you'd
never ask. Scram.

563
00:50:17,998 --> 00:50:22,239
My little kumquat,
I'm fully prepared...

564
00:50:22,318 --> 00:50:24,279
to listen to
your life story.

565
00:50:24,359 --> 00:50:26,679
Okay, I'll
tell him.

566
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:29,921
Spanish Johnny... he's checking
on the diner where the flyers hang out.

567
00:50:30,041 --> 00:50:32,321
All right, Stevie.
Make me a Bromo, will you?

568
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:35,562
What do you want?

569
00:50:35,682 --> 00:50:37,682
Everything okay?
We treatin' you good?

570
00:50:37,801 --> 00:50:39,602
Get to the point.
I'm busy.

571
00:50:39,722 --> 00:50:41,922
- Have you found the rocket?
- Busy, huh?

572
00:50:42,002 --> 00:50:44,043
My guys are tearing up the
town looking for that rocket...

573
00:50:44,162 --> 00:50:46,124
and you're busy...
romancin' some dame.

574
00:50:46,244 --> 00:50:49,443
- That dame... happens to be Secord's girlfriend.
- Good.

575
00:50:49,564 --> 00:50:51,525
She'll tell us
where Secord is.

576
00:50:51,645 --> 00:50:55,325
My boys'll get the truth
out of her in two minutes.

577
00:50:55,405 --> 00:50:59,806
Valentine... we're gonna do
what I think is necessary.

578
00:50:59,886 --> 00:51:03,246
And that includes breakin'
one of my men in half?

579
00:51:03,366 --> 00:51:07,048
Next time you go after one of my men,
I'll kill you.

580
00:51:07,128 --> 00:51:10,569
Don't threaten me.
Just do your job.

581
00:51:10,648 --> 00:51:13,768
Hey, Sinclair,
if the feds get me...

582
00:51:13,849 --> 00:51:17,568
I'm takin' you with me.
I'm gonna tell 'em everything.

583
00:51:17,649 --> 00:51:19,809
Who do you think
they'd believe?

584
00:51:19,890 --> 00:51:23,571
A cheap crook or the number 3
box-office star in America?

585
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:26,090
Number 3 jerk!

586
00:51:31,852 --> 00:51:35,533
The helmeted mystery
man disappeared into the hills...

587
00:51:35,653 --> 00:51:39,293
moments after the rescue
and has not identified himself.

588
00:51:39,373 --> 00:51:42,694
But air circus owner, Otis Bigelow,
promises his bird man will return.

589
00:51:42,814 --> 00:51:46,094
Los Angeles is buzzing.
Who is the Rocketeer?

590
00:51:46,215 --> 00:51:49,415
Now, back to our programme
of dance band favourites.

591
00:51:52,256 --> 00:51:56,815
Okay.
Here's the plan.

592
00:51:56,936 --> 00:51:59,937
We call the FBI...
get rid of this thing.

593
00:52:00,017 --> 00:52:02,057
The FBI's gonna
lock us up.

594
00:52:02,177 --> 00:52:05,177
They think we were shooting at them. What
do you think was going on at the house?

595
00:52:05,298 --> 00:52:09,459
House? We don't got a house.
We got a gazebo.

596
00:52:09,579 --> 00:52:12,580
Between the FBI and
that King Kong gentleman,

597
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:15,301
we're gonna get ourselves
killed over this thing.

598
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:18,340
Peevy?

599
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:20,581
Open up.

600
00:52:22,261 --> 00:52:25,341
We just come from the airfield.
It's Bigelow.

601
00:52:25,462 --> 00:52:28,183
- What about him?
- His office is crawling with cops.

602
00:52:28,303 --> 00:52:30,903
Somebody tore up his place
like they were looking for something.

603
00:52:31,023 --> 00:52:33,424
- Yeah, so?
- They killed him.

604
00:52:33,504 --> 00:52:37,584
Cliff,
what's going on?

605
00:52:37,704 --> 00:52:39,505
I'll make the call.

606
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:14,791
FBI, Los Angeles.
Agent Morris speaking.

607
00:53:14,911 --> 00:53:17,271
Hello?

608
00:53:17,351 --> 00:53:20,431
- I'll be home soon, honey.
- Who is this?

609
00:53:20,552 --> 00:53:23,193
- I love you too.
- Okay, wise guy.

610
00:53:28,113 --> 00:53:30,274
What can I do
for you gents?

611
00:53:30,394 --> 00:53:35,034
Madam, we're looking for a pilot
by the name of Cliff Secord.

612
00:53:35,115 --> 00:53:38,317
Does anybody here
know him?

613
00:53:38,437 --> 00:53:40,676
Haven't seen him
around.

614
00:53:40,796 --> 00:53:44,037
We need a flier
for a real special job.

615
00:53:44,117 --> 00:53:46,117
There's a lot of lettuce
in this.

616
00:53:46,197 --> 00:53:50,717
What do you say...
we lay out a finder's fee?

617
00:53:50,798 --> 00:53:53,037
How 'bout it, dad?

618
00:53:53,157 --> 00:53:55,238
Secord!
Oh, yeah, I know him.

619
00:53:55,358 --> 00:53:57,479
Short fella,
gimpy leg.

620
00:53:57,559 --> 00:53:59,639
Didn't he move
to Cincinnati?

621
00:53:59,759 --> 00:54:02,640
Cincinnati.

622
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:08,801
How 'bout you, bub?
You know this Secord?

623
00:54:08,882 --> 00:54:12,282
If you boys aren't ordering,
I'm gonna ask you to leave.

624
00:54:12,402 --> 00:54:14,762
We'll order!
Let's see.

625
00:54:16,642 --> 00:54:19,562
How 'bout those pies?
They look good, huh, boys?

626
00:54:19,683 --> 00:54:23,124
Mmm! Betcha
they're home-made.

627
00:54:27,404 --> 00:54:29,525
Don't interrupt
his meal.

628
00:54:29,645 --> 00:54:32,206
Yeah, I like coffee
with my pie.

629
00:54:33,166 --> 00:54:35,366
You know, it's funny.

630
00:54:35,446 --> 00:54:37,807
I don't like music
while I'm digesting.

631
00:54:40,568 --> 00:54:45,168
Listen, friend,
we don't know where he is.

632
00:54:45,248 --> 00:54:48,609
Okay, pop, maybe we
can refresh your memory.

633
00:54:50,890 --> 00:54:53,930
Come on.
Follow me.

634
00:54:56,730 --> 00:54:58,650
Take a good look...

635
00:54:58,770 --> 00:55:00,930
'cause you're next.

636
00:55:01,050 --> 00:55:05,171
- Talk, dad, or get a facial.
- Drop dead, you weasel.

637
00:55:05,251 --> 00:55:08,772
- I don't know where the hell he is.
- Yeah?

638
00:55:08,892 --> 00:55:11,133
Leave him alone!

639
00:55:11,253 --> 00:55:13,653
Naughty boy.

640
00:55:13,773 --> 00:55:17,254
Please leave him alone.
Stop!

641
00:55:17,374 --> 00:55:19,255
Startin' to smoke, old timer.

642
00:55:19,334 --> 00:55:20,974
Hold it.

643
00:55:29,136 --> 00:55:32,377
Jenny.
Lookie here, boys.

644
00:55:32,497 --> 00:55:34,217
Lady Luck...

645
00:55:34,338 --> 00:55:37,217
left her phone number.

646
00:55:38,978 --> 00:55:41,739
Mine!

647
00:55:42,698 --> 00:55:44,899
- Hello?
- Hello.

648
00:55:45,019 --> 00:55:47,460
This is the florist.

649
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:49,981
I've got a lovely bouquet
of flowers for Jenny.

650
00:55:50,101 --> 00:55:52,220
Who sent her flowers?

651
00:55:52,301 --> 00:55:54,461
Cliff Secord.

652
00:55:54,541 --> 00:55:56,982
- Oh, is that right?
- That's right.

653
00:55:57,061 --> 00:55:58,902
Well, he's too late.

654
00:55:58,981 --> 00:56:02,342
She's gone to the South Seas
Club with Mr Neville Sinclair.

655
00:56:03,783 --> 00:56:06,184
Hello?

656
00:56:06,303 --> 00:56:07,944
Hello?

657
00:56:08,063 --> 00:56:09,864
Come here.

658
00:56:12,504 --> 00:56:16,825
- You're not gonna believe this. Guess where the dish went.
- Where?

659
00:56:16,906 --> 00:56:19,346
With the limey to
the South Seas Club.

660
00:56:19,425 --> 00:56:22,306
Do you think fancy-pants
is pullin' a fast one on Eddie?

661
00:56:22,426 --> 00:56:25,427
I don't know,
but I don't like this.

662
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:28,507
Jeff, you and Mikey stay and
watch who walks into this joint.

663
00:56:28,626 --> 00:56:30,828
- Boys, been a pleasure.
- I'll call from the club.

664
00:56:30,948 --> 00:56:33,629
All right, Johnny.
We'll take care of it.

665
00:56:33,748 --> 00:56:36,069
Everybody,

666
00:56:36,189 --> 00:56:40,030
relax and take it easy.
We're gonna be here a while.

667
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:43,310
Mom, how 'bout
a fresh pot of coffee?

668
00:56:46,831 --> 00:56:49,151
Swell outfit, dad.

669
00:56:54,232 --> 00:56:56,833
Hey!

670
00:56:56,913 --> 00:56:58,833
Here's Mr Ketchup Bottle!

671
00:57:04,394 --> 00:57:06,955
Hey, that's quite
a dish you got there.

672
00:57:07,075 --> 00:57:09,915
Wait a minute.
That's Lady Luck!

673
00:57:09,995 --> 00:57:12,155
Get the gun!

674
00:57:12,235 --> 00:57:14,435
I got it.

675
00:57:19,636 --> 00:57:22,317
I'm sorry about all this.
I'll fix everything.

676
00:57:22,437 --> 00:57:26,038
Clifford,
what's the deal? Are you nuts?

677
00:57:28,078 --> 00:57:30,038
Cliff, no!
Not again.

678
00:57:30,159 --> 00:57:32,760
Peevy, half the city
is looking for us.

679
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:36,119
- I can fly to that nightclub in five minutes.
- Take a cab.

680
00:57:36,239 --> 00:57:39,640
The only place this is going is back
to the feds. We had an agreement!

681
00:57:39,761 --> 00:57:42,641
Look!
Peev, I'm sorry.

682
00:57:42,761 --> 00:57:45,601
I should've listened to you,
but Jenny's in trouble.

683
00:57:45,681 --> 00:57:48,523
That girl means more
to me than...

684
00:57:48,603 --> 00:57:50,923
I love her, Peev.

685
00:57:51,003 --> 00:57:54,724
- Does she know that?
- She's gonna find out.

686
00:57:54,803 --> 00:57:57,684
Promise me when she's safe
this thing goes back!

687
00:57:57,804 --> 00:58:01,124
You got my word.
I'm sorry I laid eyes on this.

688
00:58:02,406 --> 00:58:04,525
You might want this.

689
00:58:04,645 --> 00:58:07,245
I'll meet you
back here.

690
00:58:07,326 --> 00:58:10,287
Hold it, you're leaking
like a sieve.

691
00:58:10,366 --> 00:58:13,886
If you'd hit that button,
we'd be all over the map.

692
00:58:14,006 --> 00:58:15,887
- Can you fix it?
- If I had a couple of hours.

693
00:58:15,967 --> 00:58:20,247
We don't have a couple of minutes!
We need something quick.

694
00:58:21,808 --> 00:58:24,408
Let's see if our luck's
still holdin'.

695
00:58:24,528 --> 00:58:26,130
Go on!

696
00:58:26,210 --> 00:58:29,609
- Peevy, stand clear.
- What was that?

697
00:58:39,652 --> 00:58:41,612
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

698
00:58:43,013 --> 00:58:44,852
It's so elegant.

699
00:58:44,972 --> 00:58:48,613
You make it so.
Here's to you...

700
00:58:50,534 --> 00:58:54,014
and to the extraordinary way
your face catches the light.

701
00:59:02,535 --> 00:59:04,536
You must let me have
this dance.

702
00:59:04,615 --> 00:59:07,097
There's no music.

703
00:59:07,176 --> 00:59:09,458
Really?

704
00:59:13,658 --> 00:59:15,498
I hear music.

705
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:27,261
That's Neville Sinclair.

706
00:59:48,865 --> 00:59:50,945
One day, Jenny,

707
00:59:51,065 --> 00:59:54,225
a man will look into
those eyes and he'll drown...

708
00:59:54,346 --> 00:59:57,306
and never be saved.

709
01:01:37,925 --> 01:01:41,486
# When you're alone #

710
01:01:41,606 --> 01:01:45,007
# Who cares
for starlit skies #

711
01:01:45,127 --> 01:01:49,247
# When you're alone
the magic moonlight dies #

712
01:01:49,327 --> 01:01:51,888
Hey.

713
01:01:54,807 --> 01:01:57,968
- Is it something I said?
- No, it's nothing.

714
01:01:58,090 --> 01:02:01,129
Oh, Jenny, I know
that look all too well.

715
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:04,810
- Is it your boyfriend?
- I'm sorry, Neville.

716
01:02:04,930 --> 01:02:08,170
It's just that Cliff and I
talked about coming here.

717
01:02:08,250 --> 01:02:11,372
Tell me about him.

718
01:02:11,451 --> 01:02:14,852
At least give me a chance
to know the competition.

719
01:02:14,932 --> 01:02:16,772
Well...

720
01:02:16,852 --> 01:02:19,572
he's a little rough
around the edges.

721
01:02:19,692 --> 01:02:21,773
He can be thoughtless
sometimes.

722
01:02:21,893 --> 01:02:25,734
And then he can be the
sweetest guy in the world.

723
01:02:25,814 --> 01:02:29,454
He gave me these little
oranges when we first met.

724
01:02:29,534 --> 01:02:32,375
- How nice.
- My family has a small farm.

725
01:02:32,495 --> 01:02:36,576
- Cliff was coming through, dusting the groves.
- He's a flier?

726
01:02:36,696 --> 01:02:39,296
Yeah. He flies
racing planes like this one.

727
01:02:39,416 --> 01:02:41,697
At least he did
until yesterday.

728
01:02:41,817 --> 01:02:44,178
- He was almost killed.
- What happened?

729
01:02:44,298 --> 01:02:48,898
We didn't order anything.
Go on.

730
01:02:49,018 --> 01:02:52,659
Yes, sir.
A fan of yours sent some soup over.

731
01:02:52,779 --> 01:02:55,580
You were saying?

732
01:02:55,700 --> 01:02:57,660
It was very silly.

733
01:02:57,780 --> 01:02:59,980
He completely
missed the runway.

734
01:03:00,061 --> 01:03:03,021
I don't know why the
real pilots let him fly.

735
01:03:03,101 --> 01:03:06,422
I see. At least I'm feeling
better about the competition.

736
01:03:09,382 --> 01:03:11,863
Have you
worked here long?

737
01:03:11,983 --> 01:03:16,183
Oh, yes.
I waited on you last time.

738
01:03:16,263 --> 01:03:18,864
So... um...

739
01:03:22,744 --> 01:03:25,065
where is he now?

740
01:03:25,185 --> 01:03:28,665
He's probably hatching
some harebrained scheme.

741
01:03:28,785 --> 01:03:31,506
Now he has an engine.
You strap it on...

742
01:03:31,586 --> 01:03:33,427
I'm sorry.

743
01:03:33,507 --> 01:03:35,267
- You idiot!
- How clumsy of me.

744
01:03:35,387 --> 01:03:38,788
Go and get something
to clean this up.

745
01:03:38,909 --> 01:03:43,269
- I'm sorry, Jenny.
- Will you just excuse me for a minute?

746
01:03:43,389 --> 01:03:46,629
- Please stay. Sit down.
- I'll be right back.

747
01:03:57,152 --> 01:03:59,592
Are you out of your mind?
What are you doing here?

748
01:03:59,712 --> 01:04:02,232
- Listen to me.
- You're jealous.

749
01:04:02,312 --> 01:04:05,713
I'm not jealous!
Jenny, Bigelow's been murdered.

750
01:04:05,832 --> 01:04:07,594
Murdered?

751
01:04:07,714 --> 01:04:09,673
Remember the rocket
we found?

752
01:04:09,794 --> 01:04:12,674
The people that are looking for it
murdered Bigelow to get to me.

753
01:04:12,754 --> 01:04:16,994
Now they're after you. They have
your picture, the one from the Gee Bee.

754
01:04:17,074 --> 01:04:21,396
Jenny, prepare yourself
for a shock.

755
01:04:21,516 --> 01:04:23,876
I'm the Rocketeer.

756
01:04:23,996 --> 01:04:27,836
- The rocka-who? - For cryin' out
loud! Haven't you read the papers?

757
01:04:27,916 --> 01:04:31,397
- No, I've been working.
- It's them!

758
01:04:31,476 --> 01:04:33,477
The guys
with the snapshot.

759
01:04:33,557 --> 01:04:35,677
You gotta get out
of here.

760
01:04:35,757 --> 01:04:38,279
Get in a cab,
go to your mom's in Redlands...

761
01:04:38,398 --> 01:04:40,800
and stay there
until you hear from me.

762
01:04:40,879 --> 01:04:44,800
Give me one good reason
why I should believe this?

763
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:50,280
If anything ever happened
to you, I'd go out of my mind.

764
01:04:51,961 --> 01:04:53,802
Oh.

765
01:05:17,325 --> 01:05:21,646
Go on, get out of here.
And don't let them see you.

766
01:05:43,410 --> 01:05:45,211
Thank you.

767
01:05:54,854 --> 01:05:57,653
Taxi!

768
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:10,616
That's him.
Now go get him!

769
01:06:10,736 --> 01:06:12,696
Cutting in.

770
01:06:15,776 --> 01:06:18,257
Thank you!

771
01:06:39,901 --> 01:06:42,901
He's in the laundry room.

772
01:06:47,623 --> 01:06:50,583
Hit it!

773
01:06:55,384 --> 01:06:57,625
The laundry chute!
Get him! Get him!

774
01:07:15,427 --> 01:07:17,788
- It's the flying man.
- It's the Rocketeer.

775
01:07:41,753 --> 01:07:45,034
- Lock the doors. We'll trap him like a fly.
- Right.

776
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:21,960
He's heading
for the door.

777
01:08:45,205 --> 01:08:48,045
Get the rocket!

778
01:09:13,969 --> 01:09:17,611
Don't go, Jenny.
Our evening's just begun.

779
01:11:09,712 --> 01:11:12,032
Welcome
to my home.

780
01:11:15,393 --> 01:11:17,193
Here.

781
01:11:27,115 --> 01:11:29,436
It's the chloroform.

782
01:11:29,515 --> 01:11:33,036
The effects will pass
in a moment.

783
01:11:36,036 --> 01:11:38,836
Do you have to drug all
your women to seduce them?

784
01:11:38,956 --> 01:11:42,838
You're part of this.
You kidnapped me.

785
01:11:42,958 --> 01:11:48,039
Against my will, believe me.
I'm as much a victim as you.

786
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:52,959
They're blackmailing me.
These are ruthless men.

787
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:55,040
Neville, I'm scared.

788
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:59,082
Oh, there, there.
Don't be frightened.

789
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:03,562
Tonight
when we danced,

790
01:12:03,642 --> 01:12:07,442
I felt something
move inside me.

791
01:12:07,562 --> 01:12:10,323
I felt it tear loose
and take flight.

792
01:12:10,443 --> 01:12:13,363
You said that
to Greta Garbo...

793
01:12:13,483 --> 01:12:15,723
in "Napoleon's Mistress. "

794
01:12:15,803 --> 01:12:20,085
You'd have been a fantastic
Lady Catharine.

795
01:12:20,205 --> 01:12:25,085
If you'd put yourself...
completely into my hands,

796
01:12:25,206 --> 01:12:29,807
I could teach you, mould you
into a leading lady;

797
01:12:29,886 --> 01:12:33,807
clay... in the hands
of the master sculptor.

798
01:12:33,887 --> 01:12:37,168
"Moonlight on Broadway. "
Carole Lombard.

799
01:12:37,248 --> 01:12:40,167
The scene on the top
of the Empire State Building.

800
01:12:40,248 --> 01:12:42,729
Yes.

801
01:12:42,809 --> 01:12:46,489
You can't be comfortable
in that gown.

802
01:13:07,373 --> 01:13:09,894
They're beautiful.

803
01:13:24,096 --> 01:13:26,778
What am I doing?

804
01:13:26,898 --> 01:13:29,417
You kidnapped me.

805
01:13:29,537 --> 01:13:31,738
I'm so confused.

806
01:13:31,858 --> 01:13:34,298
I don't know
what to think.

807
01:13:36,818 --> 01:13:38,940
Do you want me
to try this on?

808
01:13:39,019 --> 01:13:41,660
Desperately.

809
01:13:51,542 --> 01:13:53,342
Neville?

810
01:13:53,462 --> 01:13:55,942
Could you come in here,
please?

811
01:13:59,744 --> 01:14:02,504
Can you help me?

812
01:14:16,905 --> 01:14:20,827
I finally played a scene
with Neville Sinclair.

813
01:15:43,283 --> 01:15:46,243
Hello? Hello!
Can anyone hear me?

814
01:15:46,322 --> 01:15:49,043
This is an emergency.
Can you hear me?

815
01:15:49,164 --> 01:15:52,524
Sinclair?
Sind sie das?

816
01:15:52,644 --> 01:15:56,645
Warum rufen sie an?

817
01:15:56,725 --> 01:15:59,805
My God!

818
01:15:59,925 --> 01:16:03,167
Neville Sinclair is a...

819
01:16:06,688 --> 01:16:08,647
A what?

820
01:16:08,727 --> 01:16:10,927
Spy?

821
01:16:11,007 --> 01:16:13,689
Saboteur?

822
01:16:13,808 --> 01:16:16,569
A fascist?

823
01:16:16,689 --> 01:16:19,129
All of the above.

824
01:16:19,249 --> 01:16:22,130
Lothar.

825
01:16:48,895 --> 01:16:50,735
Millie?

826
01:16:59,096 --> 01:17:01,177
Peevy!

827
01:17:03,577 --> 01:17:05,337
Hey, Peev?

828
01:17:05,458 --> 01:17:07,178
Hey, Cliff!

829
01:17:07,338 --> 01:17:09,138
Aaah!

830
01:17:10,178 --> 01:17:11,739
Are you okay?

831
01:17:11,859 --> 01:17:16,860
- Patsy, you scared the livin'... heck outta me.
- Sorry.

832
01:17:22,581 --> 01:17:25,261
- Peev?
- Wrong. This Secord?

833
01:17:25,380 --> 01:17:29,302
- Wanna talk to your girlfriend?
- She's safe out of town.

834
01:17:29,422 --> 01:17:31,503
- Cliff?
- Jenny, where are you?

835
01:17:31,582 --> 01:17:34,384
That's enough. Just to let
you know we're serious.

836
01:17:34,464 --> 01:17:36,824
You wanna see your girlfriend,
bring us the rocket.

837
01:17:36,944 --> 01:17:40,224
Write this down. Griffith Observatory,
4 a. m., by the statues.

838
01:17:40,344 --> 01:17:43,505
Come alone or we're gonna
have to kill the girl.

839
01:17:51,426 --> 01:17:53,267
What's happening?

840
01:17:53,346 --> 01:17:55,347
- What are they doing to Jenny?
- Quiet!

841
01:17:55,467 --> 01:17:58,067
I gotta think.

842
01:18:00,989 --> 01:18:03,069
Patsy, I'm sorry.

843
01:18:03,189 --> 01:18:05,509
I didn't mean
to yell at ya.

844
01:18:05,629 --> 01:18:08,949
Remember the guy
who saved Malcolm today?

845
01:18:09,029 --> 01:18:13,191
- The Rocketeer?
- He's gonna help me find Jenny.

846
01:18:13,311 --> 01:18:15,791
Freeze!
FBI.

847
01:18:21,632 --> 01:18:23,913
Remember me?

848
01:18:26,753 --> 01:18:31,073
All I did was bypass the pressure valve
and that solved your throttle problem.

849
01:18:31,194 --> 01:18:35,075
But adding a rudder to the helmet...
that was ingenious.

850
01:18:35,193 --> 01:18:38,475
Nothin' to it, Howard.
Just basic aviation.

851
01:18:38,596 --> 01:18:40,995
We're gonna make
your life miserable.

852
01:18:41,115 --> 01:18:43,117
Good to see you, son.

853
01:18:43,236 --> 01:18:46,236
- You too, pal.
- This is all he had on him.

854
01:18:46,316 --> 01:18:48,957
There's no sign
of the rocket.

855
01:18:49,038 --> 01:18:51,998
He must've ditched it,
but he ain't talkin'.

856
01:18:56,599 --> 01:18:59,079
Wooly, take off
the handcuffs.

857
01:19:02,519 --> 01:19:06,601
- You know who I am?
- What pilot doesn't, Mr Hughes?

858
01:19:06,721 --> 01:19:09,761
I designed the Cirrus X-3,
the rocket pack.

859
01:19:09,842 --> 01:19:12,202
It was stolen
from my factory.

860
01:19:12,282 --> 01:19:15,082
I didn't take it.

861
01:19:15,162 --> 01:19:19,043
I told him everything and he
believed it. Give the man his rocket.

862
01:19:19,122 --> 01:19:22,884
- I can't. Not yet.
- We agreed to give it back...

863
01:19:22,964 --> 01:19:25,524
to its rightful owner.
That's him.

864
01:19:25,644 --> 01:19:28,204
I don't think
you know the game you're playing.

865
01:19:28,284 --> 01:19:30,445
Go ahead, roll it.

866
01:19:35,126 --> 01:19:39,247
The German prototype had
the same problem as our first design.

867
01:19:39,368 --> 01:19:42,847
The combustion chamber
would overheat and explode.

868
01:19:42,966 --> 01:19:44,808
My boys figured it out:

869
01:19:44,888 --> 01:19:48,208
A double-walled chamber
into which the fuel is pumped,

870
01:19:48,289 --> 01:19:50,489
cool the chamber and preheat
the fuel at the same time.

871
01:19:50,609 --> 01:19:53,010
The German experiment
didn't seem...

872
01:19:53,130 --> 01:19:55,410
like much
to worry about.

873
01:19:55,490 --> 01:19:58,171
But when we got our hands
on this next film,

874
01:19:58,291 --> 01:20:00,290
we realized the scope
of their plan.

875
01:20:00,410 --> 01:20:04,091
Keep watching, kid.
It cost a man's life...

876
01:20:04,211 --> 01:20:06,651
to get this
out of Germany.

877
01:20:59,661 --> 01:21:02,422
Where's my rocket pack,
Secord?

878
01:21:02,542 --> 01:21:05,583
You gotta let me use it
one more time.

879
01:21:05,664 --> 01:21:07,544
I'm tired of
square dancing with you.

880
01:21:07,623 --> 01:21:11,664
I could slap you with grand theft,
espionage, and that's my short list.

881
01:21:11,744 --> 01:21:15,144
- Wooly, give me the cuffs.
- They got my girl.

882
01:21:15,265 --> 01:21:19,465
- Oh, God, Cliff, no!
- They set up a rendezvous to swap Jenny for the rocket.

883
01:21:19,585 --> 01:21:22,385
I understand how you feel,
but let us handle this.

884
01:21:22,466 --> 01:21:24,586
I gotta go alone or
they're gonna kill her.

885
01:21:24,706 --> 01:21:28,746
I'll give you your rocket
back tomorrow. I swear.

886
01:21:28,866 --> 01:21:30,747
Those guys are
playing for keeps.

887
01:21:30,867 --> 01:21:32,987
- I can handle Valentine.
- The Valentine gang is hired muscle.

888
01:21:33,107 --> 01:21:36,068
They're working
for a Nazi agent,

889
01:21:36,188 --> 01:21:39,069
someone we think is highly
placed in Hollywood society,

890
01:21:39,149 --> 01:21:43,230
someone our intrepid G-men
have been unable to identify.

891
01:21:43,310 --> 01:21:46,870
- Neville Sinclair. It's Neville Sinclair!
- What?

892
01:21:46,951 --> 01:21:49,470
- Come on!
- It makes perfect sense.

893
01:21:49,590 --> 01:21:53,392
That's why he was bossing Eddie's men
and why he has Jenny.

894
01:21:53,512 --> 01:21:57,431
Nice try. We're taking him
downtown and locking him up.

895
01:21:57,513 --> 01:22:01,153
We'll take it from here.
Let's go, kid.

896
01:22:05,074 --> 01:22:07,314
No guns!

897
01:22:22,117 --> 01:22:25,078
The son-of-a-bitch
will fly.

898
01:22:55,644 --> 01:22:59,324
- Here. Put this on.
- I'd rather freeze.

899
01:22:59,444 --> 01:23:03,405
You're right.
I prefer you like that.

900
01:23:10,366 --> 01:23:13,166
Cheer up, Eddie. You're about to
make yourself a fortune.

901
01:23:13,247 --> 01:23:17,088
That's good 'cause I got a club
to repair and an ulcer to plug.

902
01:23:17,208 --> 01:23:20,767
Hey, boss!
Here he comes.

903
01:24:05,576 --> 01:24:07,817
Jenny, you okay?

904
01:24:07,937 --> 01:24:10,177
She's fine!

905
01:24:10,297 --> 01:24:13,178
I wasn't talkin' to you.

906
01:24:14,337 --> 01:24:17,979
Take the rocket off...
carefully.

907
01:24:23,779 --> 01:24:26,060
First you let her go.

908
01:24:37,863 --> 01:24:40,263
The rocket, Secord!

909
01:24:44,102 --> 01:24:47,664
Come on, kid, hand it over
so we can all go home.

910
01:24:47,784 --> 01:24:50,825
What's it like working for
a Nazi, Eddie?

911
01:24:50,945 --> 01:24:55,466
He pay you in dollars
or Deutsche Marks?

912
01:24:55,586 --> 01:24:58,706
- What's he talking about?
- I got it straight from the feds.

913
01:24:58,826 --> 01:25:01,106
Nazi spy ring, flying commandos,
the works.

914
01:25:03,066 --> 01:25:06,628
Kid's been flying
where the air is too thin.

915
01:25:06,748 --> 01:25:10,468
Ask him about the secret room
and the Germans on the radio.

916
01:25:10,589 --> 01:25:13,829
- Relax, Frankenstein. You ain't bullet proof.
- Talk fast, Sinclair.

917
01:25:13,949 --> 01:25:16,309
- You tell him, Eddie.
- Shut up!

918
01:25:18,070 --> 01:25:20,510
Come on, Eddie,
I'm paying you well.

919
01:25:20,590 --> 01:25:22,910
Does it matter
who I work for?

920
01:25:22,991 --> 01:25:26,592
It matters to me.

921
01:25:26,672 --> 01:25:30,032
I may not make an honest buck,
but I'm 100% American.

922
01:25:30,152 --> 01:25:32,672
And I don't work
for no two-bit Nazi.

923
01:25:32,753 --> 01:25:35,793
Let her go.

924
01:25:41,675 --> 01:25:43,475
Sturmabteilung!

925
01:25:43,595 --> 01:25:45,875
Angreifen!

926
01:25:45,995 --> 01:25:48,475
Los, los!
Achtung!

927
01:25:58,798 --> 01:26:00,677
It's your move, Eddie.

928
01:26:33,804 --> 01:26:37,764
- Ergreif die rakete. Schnell!
- Jawohl!

929
01:26:37,844 --> 01:26:40,885
Haltet sie in schach.

930
01:26:41,005 --> 01:26:43,886
Goodbye, Eddie.

931
01:26:46,926 --> 01:26:48,686
Happy Valentine's Day.

932
01:26:54,088 --> 01:26:56,848
This is the FBI!
Throw down your guns.

933
01:26:56,968 --> 01:26:58,370
- Shoot him!
- No!

934
01:27:05,850 --> 01:27:08,531
Lousy krauts!
Let 'em have it!

935
01:27:17,052 --> 01:27:18,852
Careful.
He's got the girl!

936
01:27:18,972 --> 01:27:22,893
Watch out for that Zeppelin.
It's full of hydrogen.

937
01:27:22,972 --> 01:27:25,293
One bad shot,
we'll all fry.

938
01:27:33,136 --> 01:27:37,015
Come on, boys.
We got 'em on the run.

939
01:27:42,937 --> 01:27:44,937
Aaah!

940
01:27:58,339 --> 01:28:01,460
- Mein herr...
- Get this ship out of range.

941
01:28:01,540 --> 01:28:03,901
- Schnell!
- Klar.

942
01:28:03,981 --> 01:28:06,022
Sie haben die rakete nicht?
Antworten sie mir!

943
01:28:06,141 --> 01:28:07,901
Where's the rocket?

944
01:28:07,981 --> 01:28:10,061
We've got the girl.

945
01:28:10,181 --> 01:28:12,863
The rocket
will come to us.

946
01:28:50,670 --> 01:28:53,670
We're losing 'em.

947
01:28:56,391 --> 01:28:58,591
Maybe not.
Look!

948
01:28:58,672 --> 01:29:01,912
Up on the dome.
It's him!

949
01:29:02,032 --> 01:29:04,712
It's the Rocketeer.

950
01:29:09,713 --> 01:29:11,914
Go get 'em, kid.

951
01:29:50,521 --> 01:29:53,360
- Stimmt was nicht?
- Das ruder.

952
01:29:53,441 --> 01:29:57,041
- Irgendwas ist los mit dem ruder hier.
- Lieber gott!

953
01:29:57,161 --> 01:29:59,602
Also was?
Wo ist er?

954
01:29:59,682 --> 01:30:01,522
Spinnst du, Sinclair?
Was ist mit dem fraeulein da?

955
01:30:01,602 --> 01:30:03,963
Halt die fresse!

956
01:30:04,043 --> 01:30:07,603
Du ignorierst mich.
Ich habe meine stelle.

957
01:30:55,612 --> 01:30:57,813
Do not worry,
Herr Sinclair.

958
01:30:57,932 --> 01:31:00,214
My pilot is the
finest in Germany.

959
01:31:00,334 --> 01:31:03,054
We are in capable hands.
He will not let us down.

960
01:31:05,494 --> 01:31:08,336
Nooo!

961
01:31:15,376 --> 01:31:18,537
Lothar.

962
01:31:21,338 --> 01:31:23,578
Das ist deine schuld!

963
01:31:23,658 --> 01:31:27,178
We are losing altitude.
We must drop some weight.

964
01:31:27,298 --> 01:31:30,579
You, you...
actor!

965
01:31:35,341 --> 01:31:38,140
For the fatherland.

966
01:31:38,221 --> 01:31:39,741
Ja.

967
01:31:39,821 --> 01:31:42,021
Komm!

968
01:31:43,062 --> 01:31:45,822
Beeil dich!
Da oben ist der mann.

969
01:31:45,903 --> 01:31:48,303
- Los!
- Ja.

970
01:31:51,783 --> 01:31:54,104
Herr Sinclair...

971
01:32:01,865 --> 01:32:05,146
I've had a bellyful of you
and your cheap heroics.

972
01:32:05,226 --> 01:32:09,667
Hand over the rocket or I'll
blow her brains... all over the cabin.

973
01:32:09,787 --> 01:32:12,467
Don't give it to him.
Cliff, you can't!

974
01:32:12,587 --> 01:32:14,747
I have to.

975
01:32:16,267 --> 01:32:18,188
Herr kapitaen!

976
01:32:23,110 --> 01:32:25,910
Slide it.

977
01:32:37,751 --> 01:32:40,552
If she moves,
kill her.

978
01:32:51,314 --> 01:32:53,994
Oww!
Aaah!

979
01:32:56,474 --> 01:32:58,316
Where's your stuntman?

980
01:33:01,916 --> 01:33:03,837
I do my own stunts.

981
01:33:46,845 --> 01:33:48,685
Stop!

982
01:33:50,845 --> 01:33:53,845
No! No!

983
01:34:05,168 --> 01:34:09,048
For God's sakes, Sinclair.
Help us get these flames out.

984
01:34:09,168 --> 01:34:14,010
Goodbye, Jenny.
I wish I could take you with me.

985
01:34:14,129 --> 01:34:16,931
Everything about you
is a lie.

986
01:34:17,051 --> 01:34:21,531
It wasn't lies, Jenny.
It was acting.

987
01:34:30,533 --> 01:34:33,732
I'll miss Hollywood.

988
01:34:33,852 --> 01:34:37,254
I don't think so.

989
01:34:45,976 --> 01:34:48,096
Aaah!

990
01:35:01,018 --> 01:35:05,699
Jenny, this thing's full of hydrogen.
When the fire hits...

991
01:35:05,818 --> 01:35:08,339
I love you, Cliff.

992
01:35:35,945 --> 01:35:38,225
Run, Jenny!

993
01:35:41,385 --> 01:35:44,867
Steady as she goes, Howard.
We're only gonna get one pass.

994
01:36:01,070 --> 01:36:04,391
- Drop the ladder.
- Right.

995
01:36:07,510 --> 01:36:10,031
Jump for it, Clifford!

996
01:36:13,591 --> 01:36:16,752
Let's get outta here!

997
01:36:39,836 --> 01:36:42,956
- Hi, Millie.
- Morning, how you doing?

998
01:36:43,037 --> 01:36:45,357
Morning, boys.

999
01:36:47,439 --> 01:36:49,919
"Film fans were saddened
by the news...

1000
01:36:50,040 --> 01:36:53,599
"that actor Neville Sinclair
was killed in the tragedy...

1001
01:36:53,719 --> 01:36:56,439
when flaming debris fell on
his touring car. "

1002
01:36:56,559 --> 01:36:58,720
That's terrible.
That was a nice car.

1003
01:36:58,841 --> 01:37:03,362
You look awful blue for a guy
who pretty much saved the world.

1004
01:37:03,482 --> 01:37:05,802
I got the cracked ribs
to prove it.

1005
01:37:07,642 --> 01:37:09,682
You got me.

1006
01:37:37,487 --> 01:37:39,928
She's a beauty, Mr Hughes.

1007
01:37:40,047 --> 01:37:41,848
Isn't she?

1008
01:37:41,968 --> 01:37:45,049
In another month, she'll
be ready for the nationals.

1009
01:37:46,529 --> 01:37:50,329
- Miss Blake, will you excuse us for just a moment?
- Of course.

1010
01:37:57,051 --> 01:38:00,611
I've been meaning to ask you,
what was it like strapping...

1011
01:38:00,732 --> 01:38:03,932
that thing to your back and
flying like a bat out of hell?

1012
01:38:07,014 --> 01:38:11,134
It was the closest I'll ever
get to heaven, Mr Hughes.

1013
01:38:11,254 --> 01:38:14,175
Well...
maybe not.

1014
01:38:21,856 --> 01:38:24,296
See you around,
Rocketeer.

1015
01:38:25,417 --> 01:38:29,297
Oh... don't ever
fly her without this.

1016
01:38:56,143 --> 01:38:57,942
Isn't it pretty?

1017
01:38:58,063 --> 01:39:00,063
I didn't even get
a chance to thank him.

1018
01:39:00,142 --> 01:39:04,304
You don't have to, son.
He saw the look on your face.

1019
01:39:04,424 --> 01:39:06,265
Cliff,

1020
01:39:06,385 --> 01:39:08,504
I have something
for you too.

1021
01:39:08,625 --> 01:39:12,305
Actually...
it's for Peevy.

1022
01:39:14,545 --> 01:39:16,987
Oh, no!

1023
01:39:17,107 --> 01:39:20,707
What was that line again?
"Oh, my prince... "

1024
01:39:20,787 --> 01:39:23,628
- "would that you'd drink of my lips... "
- Thanks.

1025
01:39:23,709 --> 01:39:26,348
I don't mind
if I do.

1026
01:39:28,909 --> 01:39:31,629
Clifford, take a look
at this here.

1027
01:39:31,749 --> 01:39:34,349
I bet if we increase
the manifold pressure...

1028
01:39:34,430 --> 01:39:36,910
and switch the
fuel-to-air ratio...

1029
01:39:36,991 --> 01:39:39,591
just favouring the fuel...

1030
01:39:41,191 --> 01:39:44,111
Hey, Goose!
You wanna take a look?

1031
01:39:50,872 --> 01:39:53,672
Rocketeer
to the rescue!
