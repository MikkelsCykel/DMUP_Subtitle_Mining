1
00:00:18,718 --> 00:00:21,016
Some fairy tales are true.

2
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:25,046
Most other stories we make up
to help us deal with real life.

3
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:27,457
It all depends
on your point of view.

4
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,825
But here are the facts.

5
00:00:29,896 --> 00:00:33,024
There was once a princess
who lived in a castle

6
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:36,227
high above the streets
of an enchanted kingdom.

7
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:38,703
The king and queen
were long gone.

8
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:40,797
But they left her
with their treasure

9
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,900
so that she could stay
a princess forever.

10
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:46,673
On the eve
of her 22nd birthday.

11
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:49,237
A great celebration
was planned.

12
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:54,118
Molly's machine.
Speak your piece.

13
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:58,421
Oh. Birthday girl.
Pick up. Pick up. Pick up.

14
00:00:58,491 --> 00:01:01,221
Huey and I
are just sitting here waiting.

15
00:01:01,294 --> 00:01:04,388
- You better be on your way.
- Money down she's still asleep.

16
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:06,489
Molly. Wake up!

17
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:11,401
Molly's machine.
Speak your piece.

18
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:13,666
Hey. Molly. It's Justin here.

19
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,937
Callin' from the studio
to wish you a happy birthday...

20
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:20,468
Give me five more minutes,
baby, and I'll rock your world.

21
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:21,912
Love ya!

22
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:36,683
You can't turn the hallway
into a greenhouse, Miss Gunn.

23
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:38,747
Good evening, Mr. McConkey.

24
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,055
Please say hello
to your wife for me.

25
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:43,687
Bye. Have a nice night!

26
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:46,755
I've alerted the management
company about this.

27
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,206
Oh, my.

28
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:02,511
I put the flowers upstairs for you,
but this is out of hand.

29
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:03,913
Got a girl, Tony?

30
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:07,079
Not one that could fit
into this dental floss.

31
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:10,054
Be a darling and send all this stuff
to the Salvation Army!

32
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:12,148
You're the greatest, Tony!

33
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:34,304
- Molly?
- Hey, Ingrid, it's me.

34
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,042
- Where the hell are you?
- I'm sorry. I passed out.

35
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:40,313
- I was watching TV.
- That was a premeditated nap.

36
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,377
You did this to me on purpose.

37
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:44,616
You're my best friend
in the whole universe.

38
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:46,750
How could you possibly think
a thing like this?

39
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:49,021
It's like stabbing me in the heart.
Thank you!

40
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:50,494
Forget it. Okay?

41
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:53,088
I didn't want to tell you.
But our little night out has grown.

42
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,498
Huey and I are here
with a few of your closest friends

43
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,559
waiting to wish you a...

44
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,202
Happy birthday?

45
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:01,365
Happy birthday.

46
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:08,437
I tried calling you from home.

47
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:10,709
The girly to end all girlies
is in the house.

48
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:12,182
Happy birthday, Molly.

49
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:14,920
- We got you, Molly!
- We got you, didn't we?

50
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,980
You did. I thought it was
gonna be just us guys going out.

51
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:20,651
Hell, no! What kind of friends
you think we are?

52
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:23,218
Look at this.
This here is a party, right?

53
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:26,997
You're 22?

54
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:29,933
I just turned 19
and I thought I'd kill myself.

55
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:32,767
You look good, though.
Buy you a drink?

56
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:33,999
No, thanks.

57
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:37,736
I wanna connect the dots, baby.
Look at the babes, Molly.

58
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:40,836
They're, like, beautiful
and natural and sexy, right?

59
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:43,211
Beauty like that is universal.

60
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,410
They really do look young, huh?

61
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:48,113
The thing I love about women
is that you are willing

62
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:50,849
to accept each other
for who you are.

63
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,084
There you are, sweetie.

64
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:55,957
You remember Julie and Holly
from the MOMA Junior Committee?

65
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:59,294
Happy birthday.
I love your solid hair scrunchy.

66
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:01,162
- Thanks.
- Issey Miyake?

67
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:02,963
Home Depot.

68
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:07,871
You can get Botox injections
for that forehead wrinkle.

69
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:11,569
Face Factory.
No appointment necessary.

70
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,482
Why would I have
a worry wrinkle?

71
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:25,956
Why would you think
anyone would care?

72
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:29,889
Excuse me?

73
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:33,693
I had shoes like yours once,
when I was five.

74
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:41,535
That was what,
like three days ago?

75
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:43,666
Try three years.

76
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:45,768
Excuse me, Thumbelina,

77
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:49,508
but you're still a little underage
to be clubbing, aren't you?

78
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:52,813
You're a little overage to be
wearing a lampshade in your hair.

79
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:54,853
Bright idea?

80
00:05:58,224 --> 00:06:00,419
You brought your own
personal soap?

81
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,928
You want to pick up
bacterial meningitis or polio,

82
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:05,987
you go ahead
and be my guest.

83
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:08,056
Whatever diseases
you're already carrying

84
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:10,659
probably make those
sound like a joke, anyway.

85
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:14,173
There you are. I finally found
your little monster butt.

86
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,332
Come here!

87
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:17,740
I know you have trouble
reading something as simple

88
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:21,302
as a sign on the door, Gooey Huey,
so let me help you.

89
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:25,374
This is the ladies' room.

90
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:28,147
- Really? What's your excuse?
- Give me my purse.

91
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,781
My boss' kid.
They can't keep a nanny.

92
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:32,722
They fired their
third one this month today.

93
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:35,158
She had dirty fingernails.
It was her or me.

94
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,820
- That hurts.
- Where's my purse?

95
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,090
In my hand.

96
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,631
- Ing, am I hideous?
- What?

97
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:45,603
As my best friend,
it is your duty not to lie to me.

98
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:48,606
Please tell me,
am I turning into a hideous hag?

99
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:50,972
You can have any guy here
with the snap of a finger.

100
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:52,510
What's gotten into you?

101
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:03,446
Oh, my God.

102
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:06,253
Molly, let me show you something.
Come here.

103
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:09,761
- Sit down.
- Great. You again.

104
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:12,161
I want to thank you all
for having me here.

105
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:15,860
I've heard there's a birthday tonight.
Where's that birthday girl?

106
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:23,506
All right.
This one's for you.

107
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:30,509
The lights beam
down from the stars

108
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:33,780
And it takes my breath away

109
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:38,153
And the tears of glee
in my heart

110
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:41,125
End up voicing words to say

111
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:44,061
All I feel is invested in this...

112
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,462
Oh, my God.
Who is that?

113
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:48,363
That's my boy Neal Fox.

114
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:50,629
I found him playing
at a dive in the Village.

115
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:52,193
He's smokin'.

116
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:54,262
Can I have him
for my birthday?

117
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:57,571
No, Molly, I brought him here
so Roma could check him out.

118
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:00,134
Besides, he's 100% girly free.

119
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:03,910
He's celibate, like Morrissey.
He's all about the music.

120
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:07,783
You wouldn't know real music
if Mozart hit you on the head.

121
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:09,515
Quiet, the both of you.

122
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:15,221
Quiet? This place is so loud,
it is giving me a migraine.

123
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:17,353
My call of love

124
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:21,389
Then she'll rise with love...

125
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:22,627
Mom!

126
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:25,432
No, your mom's over there
talkin' to my man Nas.

127
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,666
We been tryin'
to sign him for months.

128
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:31,801
- Could you please keep it down?
- Mom, I wanna go home now!

129
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,287
- Night, Molls.
- Bye.

130
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,982
- Good night, Molly!
- Bye!

131
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:49,084
- I finished my new record and...
- That's great, Duncan.

132
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:52,096
- Nice to see you. Where is he?
...give me your two cents.

133
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,425
Huey said this guy
is practically a monk.

134
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:58,663
What the hell
are you trying to prove?

135
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:03,032
The only reason you're looking
at this guy is because you can't have him.

136
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:05,669
He's a rock 'n' roll
poet sex god.

137
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:07,736
You'll toss him in a week.

138
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:11,374
No, Ing, this one's different.

139
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,213
I can feel it.

140
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:14,685
That was good.

141
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:17,086
Kid, I haven't heard
blue-eyed soul like that

142
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:19,454
since Jeff Buckley's record.

143
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:21,186
See what I'm sayin'?

144
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,490
What did I tell you, Roma?
He's smokin', right?

145
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,895
- You did good, Huey.
- I need eight hours, Mom.

146
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:28,490
If I don't get eight hours,
my immune system crashes.

147
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,059
Record something more up-tempo
I can get on the radio.

148
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:33,128
- Let's go.
- Work it out with Huey.

149
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:34,433
Go...

150
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:37,198
That's what I'm talkin' about.
She gets it.

151
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:39,267
I get it.
You don't get it.

152
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:41,643
- Wait...
- Neal, you need to get it.

153
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:43,705
I think we got ourselves
a Grammy!

154
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:48,109
I hate that...

155
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:51,020
Kids! Always hogging
your attention.

156
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:54,225
- Hi.
- Hi. Birthday girl.

157
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:56,557
- Yeah, happy birthday.
- Thank you.

158
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:58,620
Is this demo thing for real?

159
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:01,690
She's about to sign you!
I can feel it in my bones.

160
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:05,066
Rocket to the moon, baby.
Rocket to the moon.

161
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,665
Oh, my.

162
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:16,310
Are you really
Tommy Gunn's daughter?

163
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:18,513
Seriously?

164
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:22,446
Can you hold my purse, please?

165
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:24,079
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

166
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,554
Jesus!

167
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:38,629
I guess there is
a certain family resemblance.

168
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:41,434
- His guitars are in there?
- You wanna come see?

169
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:42,496
Yeah.

170
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:52,449
Can you just wait here
just one second, please?

171
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:53,883
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

172
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,900
Right.

173
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:23,574
Welcome
to Le Chateau Chez Molly.

174
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:31,014
Nice.

175
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:35,691
What on God's earth is that?

176
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:37,786
- Mu.
- Don't you mean oink?

177
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,593
No, "Mu" means "pork" in Thai.

178
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:43,499
He was going to be my curry dinner
one night in Bangkok,

179
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:45,503
but we fell in love.

180
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:47,801
If you wait here,

181
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:51,274
I will fix us some
bonbonnieres confiseries.

182
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:57,741
Oh, my God.

183
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:02,652
Looks like you found it
on your own.

184
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,053
I can't believe it!

185
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:07,248
This is it.

186
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:10,989
This is the acoustic Muddy Waters
gave Tommy Gunn.

187
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,827
- He played it at Budokan.
- Summer of '8.

188
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,730
Daddy's little girl

189
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:16,927
That's you.

190
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:19,698
Paints the world
with her magic wand

191
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:21,433
Please don't sing that song.

192
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:24,203
"Molly Smiles."
He opened the showwith it.

193
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:26,437
For me

194
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:29,174
And then he
and my mom died.

195
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:36,478
Listen, I didn't mean to...

196
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:39,149
Okay. Yeah.

197
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:43,820
So what's next?

198
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,264
How about dessert?

199
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:53,335
Am I gonna be able
to pronounce it?

200
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:54,736
I don't know.

201
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:59,174
Can you say..."Pez"?

202
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:03,038
I'm just not supposed
to act impulsively, you know?

203
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:05,515
Part of my whole sobriety thing.

204
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:08,348
Made a vow,
haven't broken it yet.

205
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:11,022
Pez.

206
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:16,592
I haven't had a drink
in 224 days.

207
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:22,126
I'm also not supposed to have
romantic relationships my first year.

208
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,531
Pez.

209
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:31,170
It's called
the Law of Contrary Behavior.

210
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:33,734
If I want a drink,
I don't have one.

211
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:37,010
If I want to skip a gig,
I force myself to go.

212
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:40,609
If I meet a girl
and I want her to come over...

213
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:43,351
...I send her home.

214
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,148
Pez.

215
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:58,263
Those are vows
I haven't broken.

216
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:15,419
Ships crossing like ghosts
in the night

217
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:19,719
Night names,
unremembered faces in sight

218
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:24,729
Took what we can
in need to survive

219
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:29,060
Oh, my God, I love it!

220
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:31,193
It's the most
lyrically advanced thing I've done.

221
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,500
No, purple means
rock 'n' roll royalty,

222
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:36,063
and it picks up
the highlights in your eyes.

223
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:40,437
You're too hot for those
earth tones you've been wearing.

224
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:44,073
What about the song?
Is it too fast, too slow, what?

225
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:50,577
It's kind of like the same thing
over and over again.

226
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:54,319
Is there, like, a hook
or a good chorus or something?

227
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,883
- A hook?
- Yeah.

228
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:58,452
- I don't do hooks.
- Okay.

229
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:01,623
I'm not a sell-out. I don't
wear purple and I don't do hooks.

230
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:05,067
I said okay, okay?

231
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:13,810
Names... names unremembered,
faces in sight

232
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:25,380
Molly. I thought you were dead.

233
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:28,858
- Neal's in the other room.
- That guy is still there?

234
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,795
You always do this.
When are you gonna grow up?

235
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:33,855
He's never going to leave.

236
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:37,232
All he does is mope
and play these loser songs.

237
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:39,801
Help me, please.

238
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:42,705
I don't know how to get rid of this guy
without breaking his heart.

239
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:47,206
Hold.
Just a minute!

240
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,146
Oh, my God,
I'm being totally suffocated.

241
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:53,740
Yeah?

242
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:56,845
Can you take those off?

243
00:15:57,856 --> 00:16:00,017
Ing, I'll call you.

244
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:06,253
Baby... I'm not a love machine.

245
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:08,823
No, my boxers...
can I have them back, please?

246
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:15,595
Thanks.

247
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:17,941
What's going on?

248
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:21,377
- Listen, I've got to go.
- Go?

249
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:24,909
Go where, go?

250
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,645
Home, Molly.

251
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:29,654
The place where I live,
where I have a life,

252
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:33,123
where I do my laundry,
get sleep, try to make music.

253
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:35,092
Why can't you
make music here?

254
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,151
This is a world gone mad,

255
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:39,322
like I've stepped
through the looking-glass.

256
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:42,128
There's a week's worth of leftovers,
a month of laundry.

257
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:44,635
- Look at this place.
- We'll call maid service.

258
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:48,935
You call maid service.
I've got to rejoin the human race.

259
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,202
No!

260
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:54,205
I don't understand.

261
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:58,443
Listen, I just feel
like I'm suffocating.

262
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:01,509
- I need some air.
- We can open the windows.

263
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:05,250
It's not about the windows.
I need my shirt back.

264
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:09,889
Damn! I forgot
to get new strings.

265
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:12,396
I have, like,
five gigs this week

266
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:15,365
and I have not done
a single thing.

267
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:19,632
I have got to get to work.
I'll call you later, I swear.

268
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,510
Oh, my God.

269
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:36,076
This place is beyond
its normal grotesque.

270
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:37,782
It's post-nuclear.

271
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:42,787
Ninety-eight messages?

272
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:46,126
Molly, your machine
has 98 messages on it.

273
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:48,428
Write them down for me,
will you?

274
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:53,431
He's gone.
I have no life.

275
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,103
What?

276
00:17:58,177 --> 00:18:00,577
"Of course you have a life."

277
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:03,304
"I don't need to tell you that."

278
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:05,373
That's what you're
supposed to say to me.

279
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:06,475
Sorry.

280
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:10,079
As your best friend,
it's my duty not to lie to you.

281
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:12,885
Besides,
you wanted him gone, remember?

282
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,823
I did?

283
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:17,792
What are all these
final notices?

284
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:19,694
I'm gonna call him.

285
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,995
I think now is
a good time to call him.

286
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:25,401
Would you hand me the phone?
I'm gonna call him right now.

287
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:29,869
Focus for one second.

288
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:33,935
Your electric has been canceled
and so has your gas.

289
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:36,071
Who pays your bills?

290
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:38,310
Bob.

291
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:40,984
Bob who?

292
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:43,647
I don't know.
My parents' guy Bob.

293
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,258
Your phone's dead.

294
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,195
These rooms...

295
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,827
...sound so empty
without the sound of his music.

296
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:03,468
Bob's number
has been disconnected.

297
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:05,602
Oh, God.

298
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:08,510
I'm sure it's little consolation,
but you're not the only one

299
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,480
who got taken, Miss Gunn.

300
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:13,245
Bob Kopalski had ten clients,

301
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:16,947
assets equaling over $100 million,
when he disappeared.

302
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:19,252
You're telling us
that none of it's insured?

303
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:23,021
What a disaster.
Thank God for the residuals.

304
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:28,089
Actually, Kopalski took such heavy
advances on the royalty income

305
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,136
that by the time
the account recoups,

306
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:33,467
Miss Gunn will be
on Social Security.

307
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:36,440
Where does someone disappear
with $100 million?

308
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:39,568
The best we can guess
is South America.

309
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:41,135
Can't you just sue?

310
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:45,013
My God,
how could he do this to her?

311
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:48,610
He'll be back.
They always come back.

312
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:52,179
If he does, he'll be looking
out the back of an FBI van

313
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:54,487
on his way
to a long prison term.

314
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:58,553
It'll be years
before you see a dime, if ever.

315
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:05,060
Mr. Feldman, as a lawyer,

316
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:07,401
may I please ask your advice

317
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:12,967
as per what to do in the meantime
as far as, you know, money?

318
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:15,837
Get a job?

319
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:19,883
"Dear prospective employer,

320
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,653
"although I've had
no previous employment, ever,

321
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,951
"the following is a partial
but significant list

322
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:28,959
of personal recommendations,
including contact information."

323
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:32,558
The Dalai Lama, Tibet?

324
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:35,964
900-thread count
Egyptian cotton.

325
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:40,364
No man can resist
Egyptian cotton.

326
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:43,340
Tibet is a country, Molly,
not contact information.

327
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,898
Why not add "earth"

328
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:47,172
in case someone
needs to know where Tibet is?

329
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,975
This is not a resume.

330
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:51,311
It shows I'm a people person.

331
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:54,842
Focus on the interview.

332
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,911
Hello.
Pleasure to meet you.

333
00:20:56,989 --> 00:21:00,083
I will work overtime, weekends,
holidays, Yom Kippur, Christmas.

334
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:03,252
- You name it, I will be here.
- I'm sure that won't be necessary.

335
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:05,694
Ingrid says you guys met
at Darlington?

336
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:08,597
I was valedictorian there
two years in a row.

337
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:10,965
That's so neat.

338
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:14,431
Tell me, what is the price
on a set of these?

339
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:17,566
$1,369 plus tax.

340
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:20,942
You're in denial.
You're broke, remember?

341
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:25,074
Trish, hon, tell me, do employees
get a discount around here?

342
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:29,177
Ten percent, and some employees
are among our best customers.

343
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:36,552
I'll take them.
Ing, this is the greatest job ever.

344
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:47,333
- Who is it?
- It's Molly!

345
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:50,466
I was just out shopping
in the neighborhood.

346
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:53,943
- At midnight?
- It's the city that never sleeps.

347
00:21:57,749 --> 00:22:00,877
You can't do this.
I have to be at the studio at 9:00.

348
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:03,682
- I can't act like a kid anymore.
- Really?

349
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:07,418
Neal, I haven't seen sheets
like this since the third grade.

350
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,291
Rocket ships?

351
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:13,763
You wouldn't have my jacket in there?
It's like my lucky jacket.

352
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:17,268
I never get onstage without it.
I left it behind the other day.

353
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,963
No.

354
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:22,803
I guess you're gonna have to
come over and look for it.

355
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:25,308
I can't disappear
from the world again.

356
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:29,313
I can't lose myself in this obsessive-
compulsive irrational behavior.

357
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,017
Feel.

358
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:38,588
- Excuse me?
- Feel.

359
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,850
Egyptian cotton...

360
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:46,887
...900-thread count.

361
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:50,758
All right, I'll tell you what.

362
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:54,169
Maybe we can, like,
date, okay?

363
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:55,228
Okay.

364
00:22:55,307 --> 00:23:00,074
But it's gonna have to be
a mature adult relationship with...

365
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:02,841
- alarm clocks in the morning...
- I love alarm clocks.

366
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:05,075
...and work during the day.

367
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:08,347
We eat with silverware,
knives and forks...

368
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:10,987
...drink out of glasses...

369
00:23:11,623 --> 00:23:13,215
...do the dishes.

370
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:16,417
Is it bedtime yet?

371
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,425
Molly, wake up.

372
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:31,065
I'm sorry.

373
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,769
It's not going to work out.

374
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:37,741
You spent all night at that guy's
house doing God knows what,

375
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:39,841
then you come here
and crash at work.

376
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:43,684
I can't believe you did this to me
after all the strings I pulled.

377
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:46,417
I know that I'm
an undeserving creep,

378
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:48,823
but can we please
talk about it over lunch?

379
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:52,091
No! Our lunch date is canceled.
You can't afford lunch.

380
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:56,362
Fine, see if I care.
I'll live off of water and sunshine.

381
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,096
You won't have to.

382
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:01,230
Once again your main man
is gonna come through for ya.

383
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,743
You're gonna get me
a record deal.

384
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:07,369
Not exactly.

385
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:21,782
- Hi!
- Oh, my God.

386
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,657
You're my new nanny?

387
00:24:23,728 --> 00:24:25,855
- Hi, Laraine.
- It's Ray.

388
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:28,560
Nobody calls me Laraine.

389
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:31,193
Okay, Ray, I'm Molly.

390
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:33,260
We met at my birthday party,
remember?

391
00:24:33,338 --> 00:24:34,498
You're late.

392
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:36,097
By, like, a second.

393
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:39,800
By three and a half minutes.

394
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:45,339
I have to take my Aciphex
by 4:26, and it's... 4:18 right now.

395
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:48,978
- We'll take it when we get home.
- That's when I take my Colitin.

396
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:53,454
The agency must really be
getting desperate.

397
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:56,821
I actually am uniquely qualified
for this position,

398
00:24:56,895 --> 00:24:58,726
having spent so many years

399
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:01,231
developing my skills
as a people person.

400
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:12,233
Mission accomplished?

401
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:14,107
Fruit punch?

402
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,613
Why don't you
just drink cyanide?

403
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:18,239
At least it's quick.

404
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:23,947
Damn.

405
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:26,850
Hang your coat up in there.

406
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:22,239
What is this, The Shining?

407
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:44,960
- Who is that?
- Nobody.

408
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:49,472
- What's wrong with him?
- None of your b-i business.

409
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:50,940
Shoes!

410
00:27:02,687 --> 00:27:04,746
This is your room?

411
00:27:04,823 --> 00:27:07,291
There's no fooling you,
is there?

412
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:10,524
It's so...

413
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:17,159
...orderly.

414
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:22,229
These are so neat!

415
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,400
I remember when there were
only four models.

416
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:27,411
I can't believe this.
She's beautiful.

417
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,947
- Look at these legs.
- That's Plieing Polly.

418
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:32,040
Put her back!

419
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:37,779
How cool is this?

420
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:39,881
Look at this little tea set!

421
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:46,829
You don't touch that unless
I happen to invite you to tea.

422
00:27:46,898 --> 00:27:48,923
Look at these cute little scones.

423
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,991
Get away from there.

424
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:55,267
Well, I say, Lady Sassafras,
would you like some creme fraiche

425
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,900
to go with
your darling pastries?

426
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:05,809
You just got your germy drool
over my plastic scone, you freako.

427
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:14,722
Kid, have you ever been
to a shrink?

428
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:16,158
Since I was three.

429
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:19,352
What?

430
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:22,867
Good afternoon. Miss Ray.
Dinner is ready.

431
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:27,605
There's just nothing
like good help.

432
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:38,508
You missed a spot.

433
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:43,246
Isn't doing the dishes what the maid
is supposed to be for?

434
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:45,653
She doesn't know how to dry
without leaving spots.

435
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,386
You don't know how to dry
without destroying the environment.

436
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,621
For every roll
of paper towels you waste,

437
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:52,686
a tree in the rain forest dies.

438
00:28:52,764 --> 00:28:54,254
I'm gonna die of botulism

439
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:56,994
from the germs on that gunky
towel, you tree-Ioving hippie.

440
00:28:57,068 --> 00:29:01,368
At least I don't prefer tofu
to normal hamburgers.

441
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:04,670
I'm not the one who's gonna get
mad cow disease and go nuts,

442
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:07,610
though you don't seem to have
a brain to fry in the first place.

443
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:11,706
Maybe not, but at least I'm not
holding the germ-infested towel.

444
00:29:14,986 --> 00:29:16,112
Give me that plate.

445
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:18,178
No, sorry.
You might infect it.

446
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:22,556
Why don't you get your plastic
baggie and dig up some penicillin?

447
00:29:22,627 --> 00:29:24,094
- No!
- Come on.

448
00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:26,392
- Give me the plate!
- You want it?

449
00:29:26,464 --> 00:29:27,658
How bad do you want it?

450
00:29:31,803 --> 00:29:33,464
Get a broom.

451
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:36,166
You get a frickin' broom.

452
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:40,773
When you work for me,
you leave when I say you can leave.

453
00:29:40,845 --> 00:29:43,473
For your information,
I do not work for you.

454
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:45,379
I am employed by your mother.

455
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:48,044
Yeah?
Take a look around.

456
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:50,110
Do you see her anywhere?

457
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:53,646
News flash... you're not gonna

458
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:56,057
unless you make an appointment
with her assistant

459
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:59,119
or hang around her bedroom door
at 3:00 in the morning.

460
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:04,225
In the meantime,
you're workin' for me.

461
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:06,497
Is that so?

462
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:11,933
News flash, Mussolini...

463
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:14,868
I quit!

464
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:16,846
Swinging door.

465
00:30:20,451 --> 00:30:23,614
- Are you all right, Miss Gunn?
- Just great.

466
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:33,554
Baby!

467
00:30:34,265 --> 00:30:37,701
Baby, what are you doing outside
all by yourself?

468
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:43,136
How did you get locked out?

469
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,668
Mama's had a day.

470
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:59,517
I've lived here for 20 years.
How can you do this?

471
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:01,525
Aside from that...

472
00:31:03,127 --> 00:31:05,288
This is a family building,
Miss Gunn.

473
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:08,298
I suggest you find somewhere
you'd be more welcome.

474
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:10,300
Like Los Angeles.

475
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:12,359
You will be allowed back
into your apartment

476
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:15,736
only so long as you are accompanied
by a management representative

477
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:18,332
and only long enough
to gather your belongings.

478
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:21,742
That is, those personal belongings
we don't insist on holding

479
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:25,909
as collateral for the rent
and utilities you owe.

480
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:29,476
You are otherwise barred
from the premises.

481
00:31:58,383 --> 00:32:00,442
I know this is
a big change for you,

482
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:03,146
but it'll feel like home
in no time at all.

483
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:07,021
This is the bedroom...
my bedroom, of course...

484
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:10,026
but there's plenty
of drawer space if you need it.

485
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:12,927
I can't believe those creeps
would throw a destitute woman

486
00:32:12,997 --> 00:32:14,487
into the street.

487
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:16,556
Chivalry is so dead.

488
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:19,797
This is the bathroom.
I hung up your towels for you.

489
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:21,998
I've been here
a thousand times.

490
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:23,563
You know the kitchen.

491
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:27,133
Julie and Holly come over
Thursdays for our weekly bake fest.

492
00:32:27,211 --> 00:32:30,476
Mondays, Penny and Ethel come
so we can do yoga with Rajiiv

493
00:32:30,548 --> 00:32:32,413
right here in the living room.

494
00:32:32,483 --> 00:32:36,510
But this is going to be
a problem.

495
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:41,251
Ing, don't you think it's weird
that Neal hasn't called me?

496
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:43,988
No, but I think it's weird
that you're wearing his jacket.

497
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:46,587
I told you just bring
the essentials, Molly.

498
00:32:46,664 --> 00:32:49,064
You can't keep all this stuff.

499
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:52,193
And he definitely has to go.

500
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,800
Mu, what are we gonna do?

501
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:01,970
Downsize, Molly.
Purify.

502
00:33:02,046 --> 00:33:04,173
Streamline,
find your center.

503
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:05,715
You're right, Ing.

504
00:33:05,783 --> 00:33:08,775
We're gonna get you the best
housewarming present ever.

505
00:33:08,853 --> 00:33:10,013
Don't be silly.

506
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:13,455
It's gonna be hard enough on you
coming up with half the rent.

507
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:33,236
Wonderful, girls.

508
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:35,905
Tomorrowwe start rehearsing
for next month's recital,

509
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:38,005
but I think we still have
five minutes.

510
00:33:38,082 --> 00:33:40,812
How about a little freestyle?

511
00:33:47,992 --> 00:33:51,018
You sure looked great
out there.

512
00:33:54,098 --> 00:33:57,158
I just, you know...

513
00:33:57,235 --> 00:33:59,931
Yelling at you
the other day and all...

514
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:03,498
I'm sorry.

515
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:06,909
What are you doing here?

516
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:09,970
I called Roma, your mom...

517
00:34:11,015 --> 00:34:15,418
...and she said that if you said
that it was okay,

518
00:34:15,486 --> 00:34:17,477
I could have my job back?

519
00:34:24,262 --> 00:34:26,162
You're on probation.

520
00:34:32,036 --> 00:34:34,266
Act your age,
not your shoe size.

521
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:36,738
How come you left
dance class so early?

522
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:39,572
That freestyle at the end
looked like so much fun.

523
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:43,205
Freestyle is for moronic little kids
and hippie freaks.

524
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:45,078
It's fun.

525
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:47,879
Fundamentals
are the building blocks of fun.

526
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:49,078
Says who?

527
00:34:49,153 --> 00:34:53,590
Mikhail Baryshnikov,
who I'm sure you've never heard of.

528
00:34:53,658 --> 00:34:56,991
Ballet is about precision,
discipline, and poise.

529
00:34:57,061 --> 00:34:59,052
They made us take ballet
at Darlington.

530
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:02,395
I couldn't wait to get out there
and make up all my own moves.

531
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:04,196
Figures.
Such a sloppy doofus.

532
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:06,759
Figures. You're such
a pill-popping little tyrant.

533
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,433
Don't ever do that
to me again.

534
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:11,600
- You're hurting me.
- You hurt me.

535
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:12,870
Take it back.

536
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:16,079
Take it back.

537
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:18,206
Fine.

538
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:22,148
I take it back.

539
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:25,388
It's a good thing you did.

540
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:28,186
Otherwise you wouldn't
have gotten your surprise.

541
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:30,892
Surprise.

542
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:33,590
I really hate surprises,
and I sincerely doubt

543
00:35:33,664 --> 00:35:36,963
there's anything you could give me
that I don't already have.

544
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:39,195
There's no harm
in trying, is there?

545
00:35:47,612 --> 00:35:49,273
Ray, are you all right?

546
00:35:52,683 --> 00:35:56,175
My glands are swollen.
I'm having an allergic reaction.

547
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:58,245
My immune system
is crashing.

548
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:01,086
Mu stayed with you
one measly little night.

549
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,421
Come on.

550
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:06,058
And that's all
he's gonna be staying.

551
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:09,224
Wasn't it fun, though,
sneaking him in and out for his walk?

552
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:12,531
It was like a real, live adventure.
You know you had fun.

553
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:14,366
I'm not a swineherd, kook.

554
00:36:14,438 --> 00:36:16,303
Excuse me.
How much is this putter?

555
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:19,400
This putter is not for sale.
Sorry. This is a mistake.

556
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:22,037
- You don't golf.
- Tiger gave this to me.

557
00:36:22,113 --> 00:36:24,547
Essentials, remember?
You've got to get rid of this junk.

558
00:36:24,615 --> 00:36:25,809
It's essential.

559
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,479
- Twenty dollars.
- Ten.

560
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:30,680
Sold.

561
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:33,417
Can I talk to you for a second?
Come through here.

562
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:36,949
Do me a favor, all right?
Watch your step.

563
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:39,888
This is Kelli.
Kelli, this is Molly.

564
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:41,158
Pleasure to meet you.

565
00:36:41,232 --> 00:36:43,894
Looks almost as good on her
as it does on you, doesn't it?

566
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:48,234
Gooey! Looks like Mu isn't
the only pig you hang out with.

567
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:49,967
Go away!

568
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:52,805
It must be really hard
getting rid of all this neat stuff.

569
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:55,311
No, I'm actually loving it.

570
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:57,370
- Really?
- It's very refreshing.

571
00:36:57,448 --> 00:36:59,780
Everybody, once in their life,
should do this

572
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:04,514
and slough off all the bad...
Wait!

573
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:07,786
Sorry. This is... mine.

574
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:11,225
- No, I just bought it.
- How much did you pay?

575
00:37:11,295 --> 00:37:13,456
- Thirty dollars.
- My friend Rosella gave it to me.

576
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:15,999
I'll give you 50. 75!

577
00:37:16,767 --> 00:37:18,098
Enough!

578
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:20,160
We're downsizing, remember?

579
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:23,833
Sloughing off the excess
to find our center.

580
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,603
You want this, Molly.

581
00:37:25,676 --> 00:37:28,372
Close your eyes
and repeat after me.

582
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:30,510
I want this.

583
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:43,191
Miss Gunn?

584
00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:48,020
We're ready to pack this room up
for storage, ma'am.

585
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,801
Can I have just
five more minutes, please?

586
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:54,565
- Okay, sure.
- Thank you.

587
00:38:08,552 --> 00:38:10,019
Is that you?

588
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:19,323
Dad's a rock star?

589
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:21,393
Was.

590
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:23,833
He's dead.

591
00:38:24,568 --> 00:38:27,901
Bet this stuff
is worth a bundle.

592
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:30,566
I can't just sell it, Ray.

593
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:33,667
It's my parents' stuff.

594
00:38:34,745 --> 00:38:39,011
No, you're gonna box it up so it
can lay in storage gathering dust.

595
00:38:40,518 --> 00:38:42,679
God, you're pathetic.

596
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:49,792
That man in the library
in your house...

597
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:55,022
...nurse said he's in a coma
from a massive stroke.

598
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,161
That's your father, huh?

599
00:38:59,103 --> 00:39:00,695
Was.

600
00:39:00,771 --> 00:39:02,830
He's a vegetable now.

601
00:39:02,907 --> 00:39:05,137
Soon he'll be nothing.

602
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:08,202
That's kind of harsh.

603
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:12,608
It's a harsh world.

604
00:39:17,788 --> 00:39:19,779
Watch where you're going!

605
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:37,430
Neal, I really hate talking
to your machine.

606
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:38,998
Where are you?

607
00:39:39,076 --> 00:39:41,442
I'm still holding on
to your jacket for you.

608
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:43,912
I know you've been going crazy
trying to reach me,

609
00:39:43,981 --> 00:39:47,439
but I've been
in a transition right now.

610
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:50,078
I'm, like, Miss Proletariat now.

611
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:54,454
Mop the floors, spank the brat,
pick up the paycheck on Friday.

612
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:57,221
I am a woman.
How about you?

613
00:39:57,294 --> 00:39:58,886
Shit!

614
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:07,727
Get under the tail.

615
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:09,898
I'm not putting my hand
under his heinie.

616
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:11,669
Do you want him
to stay here or not?

617
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:14,643
Oh, God!
Oh, my God!

618
00:40:14,712 --> 00:40:16,771
I'll get him!

619
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,215
Very good.
Now come out of plough.

620
00:40:22,286 --> 00:40:24,447
Very nice.
Breathing. Good.

621
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:27,889
Pull up under. Very nice.
Molly, out of plough.

622
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:29,949
Come on, Molly.
Let's go.

623
00:40:30,027 --> 00:40:33,929
Could you please help me?
This is starting to hurt.

624
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:35,590
Oh, my God.

625
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:37,258
73... beautiful.

626
00:40:37,334 --> 00:40:38,562
74,

627
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:40,001
75... very good.

628
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,367
76,

629
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:42,565
77...

630
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,403
Let me put a few more on.

631
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:46,238
Ing, here we go.

632
00:40:47,344 --> 00:40:48,606
Waist.

633
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:52,845
Molly, you get to be in charge
of the chocolate chip cookies.

634
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:55,078
They're already mixed,
so all you have to do

635
00:40:55,152 --> 00:40:57,245
is put them in the oven
and time them.

636
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:01,085
Salmonella.

637
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:08,688
You're letting her do this?

638
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:10,734
Relax, girls.
It's just cookie mix.

639
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:12,928
How badly
can she screw it up?

640
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:14,595
Put it out now!
Put it out!

641
00:41:14,672 --> 00:41:16,867
I'm trying!

642
00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:27,713
Oh, gosh!
This is Neal's jacket!

643
00:41:28,919 --> 00:41:30,853
- Put it out!
- Get it out!

644
00:41:30,921 --> 00:41:33,913
Take it back!

645
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:36,255
- Oh, my God!
- Take it back now!

646
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,625
What are you doing, Ray?

647
00:41:41,198 --> 00:41:43,325
Have you gone mad?

648
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,995
There is never, ever an excuse
for hitting another person.

649
00:41:47,071 --> 00:41:48,129
What's going on?

650
00:41:48,205 --> 00:41:51,140
She was laughing at me
because her "au pair"

651
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:54,541
said that my new nanny
was a slutbag whore.

652
00:41:59,049 --> 00:42:00,516
Go!

653
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:24,735
I'm sorry.
Sorry.

654
00:42:32,683 --> 00:42:34,014
You've reached Ingrid.

655
00:42:34,084 --> 00:42:36,382
Please leave your number
and the time of your call.

656
00:42:36,453 --> 00:42:38,216
Be specific.

657
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:40,849
Hi. It's Neal calling for Molly.

658
00:42:40,925 --> 00:42:42,916
I hope this is
the right number.

659
00:42:48,261 --> 00:42:50,252
I love Ingrid
with all my heart

660
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:53,128
and all her cute
Martha Stewart-wannabe friends,

661
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,668
but it's a real estrogen-fest
over there.

662
00:42:55,736 --> 00:42:59,866
A girl needs a testosterone injection
every once in a while.

663
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:01,965
Not that I think
of you that way.

664
00:43:02,042 --> 00:43:04,033
You're super-sensitive.

665
00:43:04,111 --> 00:43:05,601
Don't be a silly goose.

666
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:07,874
Please let me
patronize the arts.

667
00:43:07,948 --> 00:43:09,882
Well, actually...

668
00:43:11,418 --> 00:43:13,409
I just signed a deal
with Schleine Records.

669
00:43:14,588 --> 00:43:16,954
Oh, my God.
What?

670
00:43:17,023 --> 00:43:21,357
Oh, my God!
Neal, that's incredible!

671
00:43:21,428 --> 00:43:24,727
That's amazing!
Why didn't you say anything?

672
00:43:25,265 --> 00:43:27,563
I would have, but this is
the first time tonight

673
00:43:27,634 --> 00:43:29,363
I've managed
to get a word in edgewise.

674
00:43:29,436 --> 00:43:30,494
I...

675
00:43:35,108 --> 00:43:37,338
So how did you seal the deal?

676
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:41,904
Ships crossing like ghosts
in the night

677
00:43:41,982 --> 00:43:45,645
Names unremembered.
Faces in sight

678
00:43:45,719 --> 00:43:49,712
Take what we can
in need to survive

679
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:53,385
I know this one.
This is the deep one.

680
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:57,453
Words exchanging kisses
in view

681
00:43:57,531 --> 00:44:03,265
Leave me scarred.
Feeling confused

682
00:44:04,171 --> 00:44:07,402
I'll see what unfolds

683
00:44:07,474 --> 00:44:09,374
Don't hide what I need

684
00:44:09,442 --> 00:44:13,344
Girl. Now. I love you so

685
00:44:16,416 --> 00:44:18,850
Sheets of Egyptian cotton

686
00:44:20,387 --> 00:44:22,787
Sheets of Egyptian cotton

687
00:44:24,257 --> 00:44:26,521
Sheets of Egyptian cotton

688
00:44:28,028 --> 00:44:30,326
Sheets of Egyptian cot...

689
00:44:30,397 --> 00:44:32,422
I guess I looked
deep down inside

690
00:44:32,499 --> 00:44:35,229
and... found that inner hook.

691
00:44:35,302 --> 00:44:37,293
You certainly did...

692
00:44:37,971 --> 00:44:40,565
...and that calls for...

693
00:44:41,641 --> 00:44:44,906
...an outer hook to go with it.

694
00:44:48,849 --> 00:44:51,943
- What's that?
- Your lucky jacket.

695
00:44:53,453 --> 00:44:54,715
My lucky...

696
00:44:56,957 --> 00:44:59,892
- What have you done to it?
- A few minor improvements.

697
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,325
- Improvements?
- Yeah.

698
00:45:01,394 --> 00:45:03,692
- You mutilated it!
- No, I fixed it.

699
00:45:03,763 --> 00:45:07,426
Look how great this is. I told you
purple was your magic color.

700
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,092
We have to talk.

701
00:45:09,169 --> 00:45:11,899
Those are the four
most hateful words in English.

702
00:45:11,972 --> 00:45:13,906
I can't see you anymore.

703
00:45:13,974 --> 00:45:16,670
- I'm sorry about the jacket.
- It's not about the jacket.

704
00:45:16,743 --> 00:45:19,109
I just can't see you.

705
00:45:19,846 --> 00:45:21,040
That's all.

706
00:45:21,114 --> 00:45:24,777
Right. You just do
the rock star's daughter

707
00:45:24,851 --> 00:45:27,251
so you can tell
your pop star-wannabe mates,

708
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:29,982
then ride off into the sunset
with your crummy guitar...

709
00:45:30,056 --> 00:45:33,184
It's not like that.
I'm just not in a place...
