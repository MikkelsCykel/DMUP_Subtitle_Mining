1
00:02:07,667 --> 00:02:11,963
- How about a tall cool one?
- Can't serve you nothin' before noon.

2
00:02:12,088 --> 00:02:15,800
Get you a beer right down there.
They got air conditioning.

3
00:02:16,009 --> 00:02:18,303
But it's a hot spot.

4
00:02:21,139 --> 00:02:24,976
50, 70, 75, 80 out of a hundred.

5
00:02:25,143 --> 00:02:27,187
Thank you.

6
00:04:03,491 --> 00:04:08,913
I appreciate all your help but I'm
just not sure if that's what I'm lookin' for.

7
00:04:12,876 --> 00:04:17,922
You're not payin' for a lot of things you
don't need. No power steerin' or nothin'.

8
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:21,676
I think it's about in your price range.

9
00:04:21,801 --> 00:04:23,386
Yes, sir.

10
00:04:23,511 --> 00:04:26,723
- Why don't you just give me a call?
- OK, then.

11
00:04:30,268 --> 00:04:32,312
- It's a hot day, isn't it?
- It sure is.

12
00:04:32,437 --> 00:04:35,273
- What's your name?
- I'm Mr Haynes.

13
00:04:35,398 --> 00:04:40,111
Mr Haynes. Harry Madox. I noticed you
walkin' away from this new car here.

14
00:04:40,236 --> 00:04:42,781
- Are you interested in a new car?
- Yes, I am.

15
00:04:42,947 --> 00:04:47,577
You obviously know automobiles because
we've had this one come back to us twice.

16
00:04:47,702 --> 00:04:49,788
But I got one here I wanna show you.

17
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:59,464
This is the same car that I drive. I have not
had one minute's hard time with this car.

18
00:04:59,631 --> 00:05:03,635
Come in here. Jump right in there
and see how that baby feels. Hop in.

19
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,763
Yes, sir, the stylin'
on this car is tremendous.

20
00:05:07,764 --> 00:05:10,433
Who the hell is that guy out there?

21
00:05:10,558 --> 00:05:13,061
Darned if I know.

22
00:05:13,186 --> 00:05:15,855
I gotta git. I'm late for Little League.

23
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:18,692
- I like the headroom.
- Isn't that something?

24
00:05:18,817 --> 00:05:21,152
It's like this car was made
for a cowboy hat.

25
00:05:21,277 --> 00:05:24,531
Let me run inside and see
what kind of deal I can work for you.

26
00:05:24,656 --> 00:05:26,700
I'll just wait right here.

27
00:05:29,828 --> 00:05:32,664
Wave your hands around
and talk like you own the place.

28
00:05:32,789 --> 00:05:36,126
I do own this place.
What the hell do you think you're doing?

29
00:05:36,251 --> 00:05:38,712
- Sellin' a car.
- Like hell you are.

30
00:05:41,256 --> 00:05:43,299
I just did.

31
00:05:47,804 --> 00:05:50,682
I got $100 off your down payment.

32
00:05:50,807 --> 00:05:54,019
The price is gonna have
to stay the same, partner.

33
00:05:54,144 --> 00:05:57,355
But I want you to look at
that low monthly payment.

34
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:02,902
- That's the best you can do?
- You're not gonna beat that anywhere.

35
00:06:03,028 --> 00:06:06,072
- We got a deal.
- All right, you old rascal, you.

36
00:06:06,197 --> 00:06:11,077
I'll tell you what. I believe you've got
the finest automobile we've got on the lot.

37
00:06:11,202 --> 00:06:13,788
I believe it's my personal favourite.

38
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:27,260
# Gotta find my baby

39
00:06:27,385 --> 00:06:31,723
# Or my heart is gonna break

40
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:43,318
unit five, I got a report
from unit six. They say they're sufferin'.

41
00:06:43,443 --> 00:06:49,407
They got lane number one.
You and Elmer take lane three and four.

42
00:06:49,532 --> 00:06:52,952
Well, I would assume then
that the truck is in lane two.

43
00:06:53,078 --> 00:06:55,372
So that's a roger. Keep me in mind.

44
00:07:21,106 --> 00:07:23,024
I'm expected.

45
00:07:24,234 --> 00:07:28,154
- Where do I park this thing?
- It's good, right where you're at.

46
00:07:33,201 --> 00:07:35,453
I'm Gulick. I'm the other salesman.

47
00:07:36,621 --> 00:07:39,082
You must be Mr Madox.

48
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:42,419
Harry.

49
00:07:42,711 --> 00:07:45,588
- How's business?
- Pretty fair.

50
00:07:47,298 --> 00:07:52,262
Tyre kickers couldn't have much trouble
finding the place, that's for sure.

51
00:07:55,473 --> 00:07:57,517
Shouldn't chew that stuff.

52
00:07:59,144 --> 00:08:01,187
It's bad for you.

53
00:08:18,997 --> 00:08:23,001
Madox, I want you to go out
with Miss Harper this morning.

54
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:26,296
Who's Miss Harper? And go where?

55
00:08:26,421 --> 00:08:31,426
There's a repo out in the county.
Deadbeat by the name of Sutton.

56
00:08:31,551 --> 00:08:33,636
And don't take any guff.

57
00:08:35,555 --> 00:08:40,602
I'm tired of chasing that son of a bitch
all over, the first day of every month.

58
00:08:40,727 --> 00:08:46,775
Sorry, nothin' doin'. Our deal
was for straight commission, remember?

59
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,527
What the fuck are you talkin' about?

60
00:08:49,652 --> 00:08:52,489
I don't make any money
running errands for you.

61
00:08:52,655 --> 00:08:56,576
- Maybe you won't like this job.
- Maybe I won't.

62
00:08:57,077 --> 00:08:58,953
Mr Harshaw?

63
00:08:59,079 --> 00:09:00,163
Gloria.

64
00:09:02,582 --> 00:09:05,210
Gloria Harper. This is Madox.

65
00:09:05,335 --> 00:09:11,132
Mr Harshaw,
maybe I could just talk to Mr Sutton?

66
00:09:11,257 --> 00:09:13,718
I've always managed to collect before.

67
00:09:13,885 --> 00:09:19,140
Forget it. You've got better things to do for
me than run that SOB down every month.

68
00:09:20,266 --> 00:09:22,560
- I just thought...
- Dammit, Gloria.

69
00:09:22,686 --> 00:09:25,980
Who's runnin' this place?
Get the hell outta here.

70
00:09:26,106 --> 00:09:29,651
- I'll get Lon to drive you.
- I'll take her.

71
00:09:30,235 --> 00:09:34,364
Oh. I thought you were sufferin'
from too full a schedule.

72
00:09:37,575 --> 00:09:39,995
It cleared up.

73
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,331
Why don't you make up your mind
who you're workin' for?

74
00:09:43,456 --> 00:09:47,711
- This is a business, not a club!
- Where's the green LTD?

75
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:18,533
Think we ought to come in like this
when he's not here?

76
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,912
Probably not.

77
00:10:51,566 --> 00:10:53,610
The man married?

78
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:58,323
I don't think so.

79
00:10:59,783 --> 00:11:04,996
He... He gets his drinkin' water
from a spring down behind the house.

80
00:11:05,163 --> 00:11:07,832
I'm just gonna go down
to see if he's there.

81
00:11:07,957 --> 00:11:11,044
- I'll go with you.
- It's OK.

82
00:11:11,169 --> 00:11:14,047
I'm OK. You can just wait here.

83
00:11:37,362 --> 00:11:40,990
- We can come back later.
- Oh, no, I found him.

84
00:11:41,116 --> 00:11:44,285
He was down at the spring.

85
00:11:44,411 --> 00:11:47,497
And he paid me. Both payments.

86
00:11:49,749 --> 00:11:51,793
Must be a fast talker.

87
00:11:53,169 --> 00:11:55,296
Glad I don't owe you any money.

88
00:12:10,395 --> 00:12:14,065
Hey! You folks lookin' for me?

89
00:12:20,071 --> 00:12:22,741
I need to talk to you...

90
00:12:22,866 --> 00:12:25,076
Well, surely, Miss Harper.

91
00:12:25,201 --> 00:12:30,498
A man of my type always enjoys talkin'
to a woman of your evident quality.

92
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:34,669
- Sutton?
- The same. The very same.

93
00:12:36,087 --> 00:12:40,884
Miss Harper, ain't you gonna introduce
me to your gentleman acquaintance?

94
00:12:43,136 --> 00:12:45,180
No.

95
00:12:45,305 --> 00:12:47,557
Another time, perhaps.

96
00:12:49,976 --> 00:12:52,020
Please.

97
00:12:59,235 --> 00:13:03,114
I'll take care of this thing. I always do.

98
00:13:12,123 --> 00:13:14,167
I think I can live with that.

99
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,974
Sure you folks won't stay for lunch?

100
00:13:42,028 --> 00:13:44,072
Another time.

101
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:10,765
Wow.

102
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:14,519
That was about as much fun
as kissin' a passed-out drunk.

103
00:14:19,566 --> 00:14:22,402
I guess I just don't have Sutton's charm.

104
00:14:22,527 --> 00:14:26,031
You liked him so much you had
to go back and talk to him twice.

105
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:30,910
- Once at the spring...
- All right, I lied about it.

106
00:14:32,495 --> 00:14:35,915
Now can you just leave me be?

107
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:46,885
Sutton a relative of yours?

108
00:14:52,223 --> 00:14:55,685
OK, kid. Maybe I got it wrong.

109
00:14:58,646 --> 00:15:00,690
Maybe I got it wrong.

110
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:12,869
I hope that's not that sleazy hotel I'm in.
Forgot to get my suit insured.

111
00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:24,673
Come on. Move it on through.

112
00:15:32,055 --> 00:15:33,306
Gloria...

113
00:15:33,431 --> 00:15:36,434
- Miss Harper.
- It's my baby, Harry. Remember?

114
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,571
Did you get that car?

115
00:15:49,614 --> 00:15:52,575
No. The guy paid Miss Harper.

116
00:15:53,284 --> 00:15:58,665
Gloria! You'll just have to do the whole
damn thing over again next month.

117
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:01,543
I hope not, Mr Harshaw.

118
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:05,380
What was the fire down there? The gin?

119
00:16:08,591 --> 00:16:10,885
No. Hamburger joint this side of it.

120
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:13,930
Maybe I'll go take a look.

121
00:16:14,055 --> 00:16:16,474
How about hangin' around
while I go to lunch?

122
00:16:16,599 --> 00:16:19,686
Sure. As soon as I get back from mine.

123
00:16:23,314 --> 00:16:25,942
I suppose now you wanna go to lunch?

124
00:16:26,067 --> 00:16:28,695
- What the hell did I do?
- Just watch it.

125
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:50,902
Mr Julian? Mr Julian?

126
00:17:51,027 --> 00:17:54,197
Where the fire, Mr Julian? Where the fire?

127
00:17:54,906 --> 00:17:57,117
- Mr Julian?
- Nobody here, Dad.

128
00:17:57,784 --> 00:18:00,870
Mr Julian must be. He always here.

129
00:18:01,913 --> 00:18:03,873
Damned if I see him.

130
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:08,420
I hear the hook and ladder
and all the people toin' and froin',

131
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,673
but I can't discover the fire.

132
00:18:12,173 --> 00:18:16,344
- You say you know where the fire is at?
- A hamburger shack down the street.

133
00:18:18,346 --> 00:18:20,890
Thank you, sir.

134
00:18:34,112 --> 00:18:36,740
Well, I hope I didn't keep you waiting.

135
00:18:37,615 --> 00:18:43,038
I guess I have to learn how not
to take a crap when the sirens go off.

136
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:48,752
All my boys are at the fire.
All volunteer firemen.

137
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:51,796
Used to have a woman worked here

138
00:18:52,797 --> 00:18:55,633
but... she quit.

139
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:00,388
Damn.

140
00:19:01,097 --> 00:19:04,601
I have got to get
that surveillance equipment working.

141
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:09,314
We hooked it up for the insurance, but
the damn thing never has worked right.

142
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:13,610
Jesus Christ!
Lucky you wasn't a bank robber.

143
00:19:19,115 --> 00:19:21,117
What could I do for you?

144
00:19:21,868 --> 00:19:24,496
I'd like to open an account.

145
00:19:25,413 --> 00:19:27,457
Of course.

146
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:30,460
Of course.

147
00:19:32,253 --> 00:19:37,509
Always happy
to welcome a new customer.

148
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:42,514
Let me find a pen to write with here.

149
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,225
A pencil will do.

150
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:52,399
Now, was that checking or... savings?

151
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:41,406
Took your time, didn't you?
I'm going to lunch.

152
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:46,036
Why don't you give Gulick
a hand with that car out there?

153
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:48,121
The hell with that.

154
00:20:48,246 --> 00:20:52,792
What the hell is the matter with you?
You got a grudge against the worid?

155
00:20:53,793 --> 00:20:56,796
Nope. I'm a car salesman.

156
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:02,719
When I want a job cleanin' cars,
I'll get one.

157
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:06,389
That may be a lot sooner than you think,
the rate you're going.

158
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:09,017
What are you, anyway? 35? 36? Huh?

159
00:21:10,518 --> 00:21:12,228
Around there.

160
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:15,315
Well, you sure as hell
haven't set the worid on fire so far,

161
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,276
or you wouldn't be
hangin' around a place like this.

162
00:21:18,401 --> 00:21:20,445
Yeah, but I got ambition.

163
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:25,867
I figure if I stick around selling jalopies
for another 30, 40 years,

164
00:21:25,992 --> 00:21:30,038
somebody'll give me a testimonial
and a $40 watch.

165
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:30,890
You wanna watch that stuff with Harshaw.
He's a good man, but got a temper.

166
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,851
Is that a fact?

167
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:35,020
Course, maybe he's got a reason.

168
00:23:13,224 --> 00:23:15,310
Hi. Can I help you?

169
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:17,896
I was just lookin' for George.

170
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,691
- George?
- Mr Harshaw.

171
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:26,655
I'm his wife.
You must be the new salesman.

172
00:23:26,821 --> 00:23:29,491
Madox. Harry Madox.

173
00:23:29,824 --> 00:23:33,286
Sorry, Mrs Harshaw,
but your husband's gone to lunch.

174
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:36,748
Oh, damn.

175
00:23:39,542 --> 00:23:42,003
Is there something I can help you with?

176
00:23:42,128 --> 00:23:45,632
Well, I hate to ask you.
I mean, you're workin' and all.

177
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:48,468
I'm not hurtin' myself.

178
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:51,846
Well, if you really wouldn't mind,

179
00:23:51,971 --> 00:23:54,849
I've got some papers and clothes
that need unloadin'.

180
00:23:54,974 --> 00:23:56,851
Sure. I'd be glad to.

181
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:02,148
Well, get in.

182
00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:28,717
I have a pair of shoes like those.

183
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:31,761
I ought to wear 'em more often.

184
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:35,306
They seem to be more effective
than I remembered.

185
00:24:58,246 --> 00:25:03,001
It's awfully nice of you, especially since
George shouldn't carry heavy things.

186
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:07,589
- Why not?
- He didn't tell you? About his heart?

187
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:10,425
He's had two attacks already.

188
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:13,803
The doctor says he's got
to cut back on everything.

189
00:25:13,928 --> 00:25:18,433
- That's why he hired you.
- No, he didn't tell me.

190
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:23,938
Well, George never did like
to go admittin' certain kinds of reality.

191
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:29,444
- Ain't you gonna put 'em down?
- What?

192
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:33,615
Mustn't know your own strength. Here.

193
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:10,819
- So what you gonna do in our town?
- Whatever there is to do.

194
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:17,283
Well, there are only two things
to do around here.

195
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:23,581
- Have you got a TV?
- Nope.

196
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:26,376
Well, now you're down to one.

197
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:32,257
Lots of luck.

198
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:30,857
- Good morning to ya, Lon.
- Howdy, bud.

199
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:33,860
What are you
in such a good mood about?

200
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:36,363
Lon, it takes a lot of money to be free.

201
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:41,326
And I'm gonna sell one of these to
the first sucker that walks in here today.

202
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:43,536
- You are, are you?
- Yes, sir.

203
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:47,749
Well, now. How do you
reckon to accomplish that?

204
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:49,918
Sheer willpower.

205
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:53,963
In this life, you gotta take what you want.

206
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:58,510
You damn sure can't stand around
and wait for somebody to give it to you.

207
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:02,013
"Gotta take what you want."
That's good. I like that.

208
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:06,893
- You know what I always say?
- What's that?

209
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:10,689
Look before you leap.

210
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:20,865
Mr Harshaw's gone for the weekend.
Huntin'. Said he needed the rest.

211
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:24,577
Yeah, and I got a notion from what.
I met her yesterday.

212
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:27,831
Mr Harshaw met her in a real small town.

213
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,709
Huntin' trip, I think it was.

214
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:35,130
He always said
that she just sort of happened.

215
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:37,257
Mm-hm.

216
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:42,345
The smart thing would've been to get out
and let her happen to somebody else.

217
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:54,190
- Harshaw Motors.
- Mr Madox?

218
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:58,445
This is Mrs Harshaw.

219
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:06,870
I hate to be a pest, but I was wonderin' if
I could ask you a teensy-weensy favour?

220
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:11,041
Well, sure, Mrs Harshaw.
What do you need?

221
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:17,005
- Mr Harshaw's cap.
- What?

222
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,940
Hi.

223
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:20,485
Well, come on in.

224
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:25,407
The least I can do is buy you a drink.

225
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:38,503
Sorry the place is such a mess.

226
00:30:39,713 --> 00:30:41,548
I gave the girl the weekend off.

227
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:53,143
Oh.

228
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:01,651
That one thought he was stalkin' George.

229
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:04,529
Did he ever get a surprise!

230
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:10,952
Bang, bang.

231
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:16,249
I hope you like mai tais.

232
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:32,098
So...

233
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,601
How are you standing the excitement?

234
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:39,856
Maybe it picks up on Saturday night.

235
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:44,861
Yeah, it does. They show two vampire
operas at the movies instead of one.

236
00:31:45,362 --> 00:31:47,364
I could buy a TV.

237
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:51,368
Or you could join the Ladies Club
and collect trash.

238
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:53,828
Now there's a hot pastime.

239
00:31:56,373 --> 00:31:59,417
I doubt if I could pass
the credentials committee.

240
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:02,379
Not if you approached 'em one at a time.

241
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:06,174
You'd be lucky if you ever
got your credentials back.

242
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,974
Which one lives over there?

243
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:18,520
Mrs Gross.

244
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:20,855
She's the one with the binoculars.

245
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:25,360
What do you think of the view?

246
00:32:30,991 --> 00:32:33,034
Better all the time.

247
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:38,540
That's where the pool was gonna go.

248
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:41,209
George said I could have one
if I was good.

249
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:45,922
But... he said his family hadn't had one

250
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:49,634
and what was good enough for them
was good enough for us.

251
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:56,850
I meant to ask you... about findin' me.

252
00:32:58,268 --> 00:33:00,478
Did I give you the right directions?

253
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:05,025
I could find it in the dark.

254
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,903
You sure?

255
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:20,832
I think you'd better leave.

256
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:24,586
Like hell.

257
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:27,088
I thought you said
you lived in a small town.

258
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:30,300
Then you'd know that bitch over there
watched you arrive.

259
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:33,345
And she's watchin' right now
for you to leave.

260
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,898
Who cares?

261
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:47,317
I do.

262
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:01,081
Bad boy.

263
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:05,502
Bad, bad boy.

264
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:14,052
I'm going to bed. You can let yourself out.

265
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:21,685
- How much?
- A dollar.

266
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:25,313
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

267
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:41,496
I need a double order
of grits and some more toast.

268
00:34:43,707 --> 00:34:45,375
What you reading?

269
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,752
Oh! Oh, nothing. It's...

270
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:51,881
it's just... silly.

271
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:57,137
Would you...

272
00:34:57,262 --> 00:35:00,223
Would you like a soda? Yeah, a soda.

273
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:04,602
- You don't want a soda.
- Yes, I do.

274
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:13,486
Yes, I do. What could be nicer on a hot
afternoon than a tall, clean, cool soda?

275
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:19,034
All right.

276
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:34,841
"He was a stranger in town.
A rough man, mocking, sometimes cruel."

277
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:38,803
"But Miriam saw past the tough facade
to the bitter wounds that made him

278
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:42,474
- hide his true self from the worid."
- I told you it was silly.

279
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:46,227
Oh, Junior, better not read that stuff.
It's bad for you.

280
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:58,073
I'm sorry about the other day.

281
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:02,160
I must've had the book open
to the wrong place.

282
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:04,329
Oh, please.

283
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:10,543
I realised later what it must've looked like.

284
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:17,342
My life's just been a succession of jams
over floozies of one kind or another.

285
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:20,387
I forget how to treat a real lady.

286
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,600
What do you say
we forget about the whole thing?

287
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:27,769
Start over. Make friends.

288
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:36,778
How about tonight? Wanna go for a ride?

289
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:42,534
Hey, look... I have to get back.

290
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:46,871
I'll drive you.

291
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:51,459
- It's just walking distance.
- I'll walk you.

292
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:55,880
She's a wonderful woman,
the woman who raised me.

293
00:36:57,007 --> 00:36:59,759
She's always takin' people in.

294
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:03,054
Always feedin' the whole neighbourhood.

295
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:06,016
She had a daughter,
a little bit older than me.

296
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:08,727
She was my best friend
in the whole worid.

297
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:11,813
"Was"?

298
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:13,982
Yeah, she died.

299
00:37:15,025 --> 00:37:17,360
It was a bad time.

300
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:19,946
Spunky. Hey!

301
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:22,115
Look who's waitin' here!

302
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:37,255
- You're very pretty.
- Oh, I'm just ordinary.

303
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:40,425
Ordinary?

304
00:39:16,563 --> 00:39:18,606
Well...

305
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:24,863
Well, what?

306
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:29,159
Well, don't you ever knock?

307
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,247
Only when I'm not expected.

308
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:39,461
You were expected all right.

309
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:52,701
That was pretty ballsy of you, Harry.

310
00:40:52,826 --> 00:40:54,953
Just comin' in my house like that.

311
00:40:58,206 --> 00:41:02,836
What would you have done
if I'd have screamed?

312
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:07,716
But you didn't scream, did you?

313
00:41:10,844 --> 00:41:13,138
Why don't you pour me another drink?

314
00:41:15,765 --> 00:41:18,309
There isn't any.

315
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,520
The hell there ain't.

316
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,609
What happened to it, I wonder.

317
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:29,863
Maybe it leaks.

318
00:41:31,072 --> 00:41:33,116
You know, Harry.

319
00:41:34,117 --> 00:41:36,661
We're a lot alike, you and me.

320
00:41:39,164 --> 00:41:45,879
Cos we got these hard, hard outsides.

321
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:51,051
- But inside...
- We're hard, hard, hard.

322
00:41:54,763 --> 00:41:56,806
Harry?

323
00:41:58,058 --> 00:42:00,101
Do you think I'm fat?

324
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:04,981
Of course not.

325
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:07,817
Well, you sure as hell oughta know.

326
00:42:17,994 --> 00:42:20,288
I don't know what the hell I'm doin' here.

327
00:42:21,915 --> 00:42:24,668
You seemed to like it at the time.

328
00:42:27,462 --> 00:42:31,299
What's my batting average
always been for stayin' out of trouble

329
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:33,718
when it's baited with this much tramp?

330
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:38,640
Even zero.

331
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:43,812
- You're insultin'.
- You'll live.

332
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:52,237
I don't mind a little insult now and then.

333
00:42:53,989 --> 00:42:57,492
Long as I'm sure it's just a little love play.

334
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:00,495
It isn't.

335
00:43:19,848 --> 00:43:22,475
- Where you going, Harry?
- Nuts.

336
00:44:38,218 --> 00:44:40,679
# Knocked out of my brain

337
00:44:41,638 --> 00:44:43,932
# Since I fell for you

338
00:44:45,433 --> 00:44:48,770
# Now I've come down

339
00:44:48,895 --> 00:44:50,855
# With the heartbreak blues

340
00:44:52,315 --> 00:44:54,776
# It's gonna take a doctor

341
00:44:55,777 --> 00:44:58,029
# With a special degree

342
00:44:59,322 --> 00:45:01,658
# Cos I need a love doctor

343
00:45:02,575 --> 00:45:05,036
# I'm your Love MD

344
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:27,183
Recognise these?

345
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:30,311
The shoes, I mean.

346
00:45:31,938 --> 00:45:34,858
I always wanted to be
put up on a pedestal.

347
00:45:36,026 --> 00:45:38,069
You are crazy.

348
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:40,757
What about your husband?

349
00:46:41,591 --> 00:46:43,301
Oh...

350
00:46:43,426 --> 00:46:46,054
I take my opportunities where I find 'em.

351
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:52,268
Wanna look at mine?

352
00:46:55,397 --> 00:46:59,442
You can come up real close
and get a real good look.

353
00:47:38,398 --> 00:47:41,901
That was more fun
than eatin' cotton candy barefoot.

354
00:47:45,113 --> 00:47:47,532
It's late. I gotta go.

355
00:47:49,492 --> 00:47:51,536
Is it late, Harry?

356
00:47:58,585 --> 00:48:00,628
Oh, God.

357
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,084
Got a light?

358
00:50:21,227 --> 00:50:24,272
Hey! Home for lunch, back at two.

359
00:50:30,612 --> 00:50:33,448
Now, y'all come over here. Come on!

360
00:50:33,657 --> 00:50:35,909
This one here is my personal favourite.

361
00:50:36,034 --> 00:50:40,664
Never mind this door bein' open.
I'm just airin' out the back seat.

362
00:50:43,333 --> 00:50:47,545
Climb up in there and have a look at
the size of that seat. It's absolutely huge.

363
00:50:56,888 --> 00:51:00,725
You could have half a dozen
kids in there. You'd lose half of 'em.

364
00:51:01,017 --> 00:51:03,186
Don't you love a big seat? I know I do.

365
00:51:28,253 --> 00:51:30,714
Lon, I'm gonna go check out the fire.

366
00:53:55,775 --> 00:53:58,445
I'll give you the combination number.

367
00:53:58,570 --> 00:54:00,613
Just don't kill me.

368
00:54:00,864 --> 00:54:05,201
It's 397... 6557.

369
00:54:05,327 --> 00:54:08,163
There's plenty in there.

370
00:54:08,288 --> 00:54:10,957
357...

371
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:15,045
395...

372
00:54:15,378 --> 00:54:19,424
3957...

373
00:55:12,894 --> 00:55:15,480
Mr Julian! That you?

374
00:55:16,356 --> 00:55:18,400
Mr Julian!

375
00:55:20,485 --> 00:55:22,529
Mr Julian? You in there?

376
00:55:28,201 --> 00:55:30,745
You in there, Mr Julian?

377
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:54,144
Mr Julian?

378
00:56:17,751 --> 00:56:20,420
Can y'all please just keep your distance?

379
00:56:29,721 --> 00:56:32,432
- Give him a hand with the hose!
- I got it!

380
00:56:34,434 --> 00:56:36,811
Hey! Help!

381
00:56:38,313 --> 00:56:40,774
Help! Help!

382
00:56:43,026 --> 00:56:45,695
Oh, God! Somebody help me!

383
00:56:51,576 --> 00:56:53,411
Fuck.

384
00:56:53,536 --> 00:56:55,580
Hose me down! Hose me down!

385
00:57:03,588 --> 00:57:05,632
Who the hell is he?

386
00:58:40,393 --> 00:58:44,313
Are you all right, Mort?
He didn't hurt you?

387
00:59:54,967 --> 00:59:58,805
And in thee shall all families
of the earth be blessed.

388
00:59:58,971 --> 01:00:02,642
He was driven to part from all men.

389
01:00:02,767 --> 01:00:08,231
So Abram departed, as the Lord had
spoken unto him; and Lot went with him:

390
01:00:08,731 --> 01:00:11,234
And Abram was 70 and five...
