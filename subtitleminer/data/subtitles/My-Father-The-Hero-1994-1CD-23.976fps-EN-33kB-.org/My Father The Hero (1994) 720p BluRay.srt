00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,505
We did France in '<i>8</i>9.
Or was that ltaly?

159
00:13:39,637 --> 00:13:41,843
Spain.
The place was crawling with bulls.

160
00:13:41,973 --> 00:13:44,464
Everywhere l looked,
there was a big bull.

161
00:13:45,727 --> 00:13:49,855
Yeah, well, whatever. Anyway, we got
first class seats for coach prices.

162
00:13:49,982 --> 00:13:53,185
The room was half price.
Free breakfast, too.

163
00:13:53,319 --> 00:13:55,727
Oh, fascinating. Excuse me.

164

Au revoir, Andre.

165
00:13:58,825 --> 00:14:00,533
Au revoir.

166
00:14:23,728 --> 00:14:26,932
- Who was that?
- Pablo. You scared him off.

167
00:14:27,065 --> 00:14:28,441
l can see he's the shy type.

168

169
00:14:30,986 --> 00:14:33,193
And who's thatHis parole officer?

170
00:14:34,782 --> 00:14:36,822
l'm going to the beach.

171
00:14:37,952 --> 00:14:40,278
- See ya.
- What's that?

172
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:43,415
- What are you wearing?
- My bathing suit.

173
00:14:43,542 --> 00:14:45,167
- The whole thing?
- You don't like it?

174
00:14:45,294 --> 00:14:47,868
Are you sure you didn't leave
part of it in the box?

175
00:14:48,005 --> 00:14:50,331
Get real, Andre.
Everybody's wearing them.

176
00:14:51,301 --> 00:14:53,175
Everyone's staring at you.

177
00:14:53,303 --> 00:14:55,095
No, everyone's staring at you.

179

And l insist you loosen up,
Andre, dear.

Now, <i>she's</i> French.

181

Ouch!

182

Pablo's playing at a party tomorrow
and he's invited me.

183
00:15:08,779 --> 00:15:11,448
- We can go after supper.
- Daddy, you're not invited.

184
00:15:11,574 --> 00:15:14,777
- Well, l'm inviting me.
- l can't show up with my father.

185
00:15:14,911 --> 00:15:17,580
Then you can't go. l don't want you
going out with that boy.

186
00:15:17,706 --> 00:15:20,031
- l'm not going out with him.
- l said no!

187
00:15:20,167 --> 00:15:21,626
WhyBecause he's black?

188
00:15:21,752 --> 00:15:23,994
Not because he's black.
Because you're 14.

189
00:15:24,129 --> 00:15:25,624
Fourteen and a half.

190
00:15:25,756 --> 00:15:27,796
- Besides, he's a musician.
- So?

191
00:15:27,925 --> 00:15:31,840
So you can't date a musician
until all the other men are dead.

192
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:35,175
Stop overdoing this father stuff,
it's not impressing me.

193
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,803
l'm not doing it to impress you.

194
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,806
You can't make up for being gone
five years in two weeks.

195
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,430
- l've been around.
- You could have fooled me.

Nicole!

197

This beach is private property.

198
00:16:58,903 --> 00:17:02,853

- l walked here.

199
00:17:02,991 --> 00:17:04,900
You <i>walked</i> hereThat was stupid.

200
00:17:05,035 --> 00:17:08,120
A young kid like yourself
walking under those cliffs.

201
00:17:08,247 --> 00:17:11,948
A kidPlease! l'm 1 <i>8</i>.

202
00:17:12,084 --> 00:17:13,283
Ha!

203
00:17:13,419 --> 00:17:15,079
Well, be careful, 1 <i>8</i>-year-old,

204
00:17:15,213 --> 00:17:18,582
because high tide comes in at 3:1 5,
and you'll be stuck out here.

205
00:17:19,426 --> 00:17:21,170
Do you live here or something?

206
00:17:21,303 --> 00:17:23,343
My parents have a house
down the beach.

207
00:17:23,472 --> 00:17:25,512
Are you here with your parents?

208
00:17:27,644 --> 00:17:29,518
A friend.

209
00:17:30,564 --> 00:17:33,020
Well, good luck walking back.

210
00:17:35,569 --> 00:17:37,443
She walked here! Shhhh!

211
00:17:50,127 --> 00:17:53,378
- Did you have a nice day?
- Yeah, great.

212
00:17:57,886 --> 00:18:00,377
Once the Europeans unite
in the Common Market,

213
00:18:00,514 --> 00:18:03,302
they'll be facing off against
the Americans. Watch out!

214
00:18:03,434 --> 00:18:04,465
Oh, yeah. Watch out.

215
00:18:04,602 --> 00:18:08,102
What both sides really want is access
to the Russian markets. Think of it.

216
00:18:08,231 --> 00:18:11,351
250 million customers, presto,
like that!

217
00:18:11,485 --> 00:18:16,443
All anxious to spend their roubles
on Reeboks and cappuccino machines.

218
00:18:16,574 --> 00:18:18,531
Think of it! Ah, there is Nicole.

219

Nicole, this is Raymond.
Raymond, Nicole.

How's it goingNice day, huh?

221
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:26,872
Raymond is from New York, too.

224
00:18:31,549 --> 00:18:34,219
Good school.
Outstanding humanities programme.

l'm into economics myself, aiming for
Harvard Business School. Get my MBA,

Andre, what are your thoughts
on the Maastricht Treaty?

231
00:18:58,663 --> 00:19:00,288
l know France has been behind it,

232
00:19:00,415 --> 00:19:03,452
but now the socialists are out
on their butts, do you think...

233
00:19:03,585 --> 00:19:07,797
Well, if France drops out, then
Germany would get that much stronger.

234
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,340
- l'm dying.

to distract you, so l'll do my best.

- No, she's in Paris.

Ah!
Lovely city, Paris. So romantic.

245

Yeah. Yeah, he's my boyfriend.

Nicole!

311
00:24:25,907 --> 00:24:27,070
<i>..living hell.</i>

312
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,035
- <i>What happened when you were 17?</i>
- Nicole!

313
00:24:30,162 --> 00:24:31,989
<i>That's when I went to live</i>
<i>with Dwayne.</i>

314
00:24:32,122 --> 00:24:34,495
<i>My mother's a prostitute</i>
<i>and my father's doing time</i>

315
00:24:34,625 --> 00:24:35,621
<i>for armed robbery.</i>

316
00:24:35,751 --> 00:24:37,661
<i>I'd have done anything</i>
<i>to get out of there.</i>

317
00:24:37,795 --> 00:24:40,251
- Nicole!
- What?

318
00:24:41,049 --> 00:24:42,627
Come here and look.

319
00:24:42,759 --> 00:24:44,799
- Look at what?
- The moon.

320
00:24:44,928 --> 00:24:47,799
- What about it?
- lt's rising.

321
00:24:47,932 --> 00:24:48,928
Great.

322
00:24:49,058 --> 00:24:52,225
- <i>..learned to sniff model glue.</i>
- lt's magnificent!

323
00:24:52,353 --> 00:24:56,102
Turn that off
and come here and look at it.

324
00:24:56,233 --> 00:24:58,272
ln a minute.

325
00:24:58,402 --> 00:24:59,813
Hurry up.

326
00:24:59,945 --> 00:25:01,985
Hold on, it's not going anywhere.

327
00:25:02,114 --> 00:25:07,406
Get out here and look at
the goddamn moon. lt's glorious.

328
00:25:12,167 --> 00:25:14,207
[TV off]

329
00:25:15,129 --> 00:25:18,830
lt's not like l've never seen
the moon before.

330
00:25:19,843 --> 00:25:21,882
Where is it?

331
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:24,928
lt'll be out again in a minute.

332
00:25:28,978 --> 00:25:31,765
- Where are you going?
- For a walk.

333
00:25:41,325 --> 00:25:43,199
lt's pretty, isn't it?

334
00:25:43,327 --> 00:25:45,237
- Hi.
- What are you doing?

335
00:25:45,371 --> 00:25:46,949
Going for a walk. You?

336
00:25:47,082 --> 00:25:51,127
- l was on my way home.
- Want some company?

337
00:25:51,253 --> 00:25:52,712
Sure.

338
00:25:52,838 --> 00:25:55,080
<i>I miss you, Andre,</i>

339
00:25:55,216 --> 00:26:01,670
<i>but I've decided I can't go on</i>
<i>feeling that you're not there for me.</i>

340
00:26:01,807 --> 00:26:05,721
<i>I need more, or maybe less.</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>

341
00:26:05,853 --> 00:26:08,344
<i>I need an answer, that's all.</i>

342
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:19,030
So, he's like your sugar daddy?

343
00:26:20,035 --> 00:26:22,075
Yeah, sort of.

344
00:26:22,955 --> 00:26:24,995
- He saved me.
- From what?

345
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:28,909
From my boyfriend Dwayne.
From a life on the streets.

346
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:34,039
When l met Andre, l was a runaway.
l was into dope pretty bad.

347
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:36,886
ReallyYou were?

348
00:26:37,013 --> 00:26:40,465
Well, l started with the easy stuff.
You know, like sniffing glue.

349
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,270
Stuff like that.
Then l went to the hard stuff.

350
00:26:44,563 --> 00:26:47,399
l was stealing to support my habit
and l got busted.

351
00:26:49,152 --> 00:26:52,853
That's when Andre found me.
He turned my life around.

352
00:26:54,157 --> 00:26:56,483
So, he's like a father to you?

353
00:26:56,618 --> 00:26:58,279
You could say that, yeah.

354
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,540
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

355
00:27:05,879 --> 00:27:07,670
Have you met any nice men yet?

356
00:27:07,798 --> 00:27:10,087
Besides youNo.

357
00:27:10,217 --> 00:27:13,633
- What about them?
- Oh, them?

358
00:27:13,763 --> 00:27:16,883
The men that God forgot?
l'm not interested.

359
00:27:17,016 --> 00:27:19,555
You're very attractive, you know.

360
00:27:20,729 --> 00:27:23,220
lf l were not already spoken for...

361
00:27:23,357 --> 00:27:26,275
And how is the person
who's speaking for you?

362
00:27:27,069 --> 00:27:30,653
lsabel?
She's angry at me for some reason.

363
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:34,732
Then she disappears because
she said she can't think in Paris.

364
00:27:34,912 --> 00:27:37,118
What does she mean,
she can't think in Paris?

365
00:27:37,247 --> 00:27:38,872
Descartes thought in Paris.

366
00:27:38,999 --> 00:27:43,413
So did Rousseau and Jean Paul Sartre.
lt was good enough for them.

367
00:27:43,546 --> 00:27:46,666
She probably just needs
to get away from you for a while.

368
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,876
l don't understand women.

369
00:27:49,011 --> 00:27:52,095
So, what is it about us
that you don't understand?

370
00:27:52,223 --> 00:27:54,679
Everything. Everything!

371
00:27:54,809 --> 00:27:56,802
l don't understand
my ex-wife or my lover,

372
00:27:56,936 --> 00:28:01,266
and l especially do not understand
my daughter. She hates me.

373
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,816
Don't be silly. Niki idolises you.

374
00:28:06,697 --> 00:28:10,696
My father?
He's in prison for armed robbery.

375
00:28:10,827 --> 00:28:14,825
He knocked off a liquor store, shot
the owner, took customers hostage.

376
00:28:14,957 --> 00:28:17,626
He drove through five states
before they caught him.

377
00:28:17,751 --> 00:28:22,248
- So, has Niki ever been in love?
- Nicoleln loveOf course not.

378
00:28:22,382 --> 00:28:25,253
What does she know about love?
She's too young.

379
00:28:25,385 --> 00:28:28,303
She doesn't know anything about men,
you know.

380
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:30,423
She thinks
love is like some fairy tale.

381
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:33,642
My mother's a prostitute.
She ran off with her pimp.

382
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:36,059
So, what's this guy Andre like?

383
00:28:37,023 --> 00:28:39,479
Most of the time, he's really nice.

384
00:28:39,609 --> 00:28:43,774
He has a pretty bad temper, though.
And he gets jealous real easy.

385
00:28:43,906 --> 00:28:46,113
He was in jail, too.

386
00:28:47,368 --> 00:28:48,697
You're kidding me!

387
00:28:49,287 --> 00:28:53,155
Who am l to criticiseWithout Andre,
l don't know where l'd be right now.

388
00:28:53,292 --> 00:28:55,331
l probably wouldn't even be alive.

389
00:28:57,087 --> 00:28:59,045
[sighs]

390
00:29:00,258 --> 00:29:02,298
That's him.

391
00:29:03,678 --> 00:29:05,885
- Hello.
- Hello, yourself!

392
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:15,682
Well, l'll be seeing you.

393
00:29:15,859 --> 00:29:20,486
- lf he ever hurts you...
- AndreHe would never hurt me.

394
00:29:21,991 --> 00:29:25,490
Niki, you don't understand men like
him. Prison is a really tough place.

395
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:28,289
lt was a minimum security prison.

396
00:29:28,414 --> 00:29:29,529
Well, still...

397
00:29:29,666 --> 00:29:31,825
l should go.
l don't want to get him upset.

398
00:29:36,298 --> 00:29:38,505
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

399
00:30:37,576 --> 00:30:39,569
Good night, Daddy.

400
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:52,380
Good night, Nicole.

401
00:30:56,264 --> 00:30:59,680
He's totally taking advantage of her.
She's only 16 years old.

402
00:30:59,809 --> 00:31:02,846
l can't believe that guy tells people
she's his daughter.

403
00:31:02,979 --> 00:31:07,393
l know. She's terrified of him.
She says she isn't, but she is.

404
00:31:07,526 --> 00:31:10,148
That's going to be the easiest score
you'll ever have.

405
00:31:10,279 --> 00:31:11,690
What do you mean?

406
00:31:11,823 --> 00:31:15,157
She's not like going out with
one of the staff girls here.

407
00:31:15,285 --> 00:31:19,366
lf she sleeps with a guy that age,
she'll fall for a guy like you, easy.

408
00:31:19,498 --> 00:31:20,957
You think so?

409
00:31:21,083 --> 00:31:24,499
Trust me. This girl's experienced.
She expects that from a guy.

410
00:31:24,629 --> 00:31:26,669
Hi!

411
00:31:28,675 --> 00:31:30,964
l would like to go water skiing
with my daughter.

412
00:31:31,094 --> 00:31:32,340
- Right.
- Sure!

413
00:31:32,471 --> 00:31:35,009
- This is Nicole, my daughter.
- Niki.

414
00:31:35,141 --> 00:31:36,884
- Say hello to...?
- Ben.

415
00:31:37,018 --> 00:31:38,845
- Hi.
- l'm Tom.

416
00:31:38,978 --> 00:31:40,686
Hi, Tom.

417
00:31:43,233 --> 00:31:45,273
Did you have any problems
about last night?

418
00:31:45,402 --> 00:31:47,027
No, he didn't even notice l was gone.

419
00:31:47,154 --> 00:31:49,194
Let me help you.

420
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:53,073
Give me that!

421
00:31:53,203 --> 00:31:55,990
l know what you were doing!
Come on, sweetheart.

422
00:32:05,967 --> 00:32:07,461
Watch how l do it, Nicole.

423
00:32:11,432 --> 00:32:13,471
What are we waiting for?

424
00:32:13,768 --> 00:32:15,807
Go. Go!

425
00:32:27,366 --> 00:32:29,940
Wonderful! But maybe a little slower.

426
00:32:34,166 --> 00:32:36,871
Watch out!
You're going to break his neck.

427
00:32:37,002 --> 00:32:41,047
- Would that be so bad?
- Slow down. The water is rough.

428
00:32:42,717 --> 00:32:44,757
l can fix that.

429
00:32:53,145 --> 00:32:55,850
Stop! Stop! Go back!

430
00:32:56,774 --> 00:32:58,732
Go back. Turn back. lt's too narrow.

431
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,319
Stop!

432
00:33:03,741 --> 00:33:06,446
- Watch where you're going.
- l'm not going to hurt the bastard.

433
00:33:06,577 --> 00:33:08,617
He's not a bastard.

434
00:33:09,747 --> 00:33:11,621
Arrrrgh!

435
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:26,671
Andre, get down!

436
00:33:30,521 --> 00:33:33,439
Are you crazySlow down.

437
00:33:34,817 --> 00:33:36,857
Watch out!

438
00:33:40,574 --> 00:33:42,614
Hey! [indistinct oath]

439
00:33:43,953 --> 00:33:46,242
l don't understand
what you see in that guy.

440
00:33:46,372 --> 00:33:49,159
What do you mean?
You don't know him at all.

441
00:33:49,292 --> 00:33:51,332
Aaaargh!

442
00:33:57,134 --> 00:34:00,385
What are you doingMy God, no!

443
00:34:00,513 --> 00:34:02,969
- He's not a dirty old man.
- Oh, yes, he is.

444
00:34:03,099 --> 00:34:04,475
- No, he's not.
- He is, too.

445
00:34:05,352 --> 00:34:09,302
- Hey! Andy!
- Ride 'em, cowboy!

446
00:34:10,941 --> 00:34:14,311
Slow down! [cursing in French]

447
00:34:14,862 --> 00:34:17,104
- Mel'm judgemental?
- Yeah, you.

448
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,696
l'm just trying to show you
what's going on here.

449
00:34:19,826 --> 00:34:21,534
WhatWhat's going on here?

450
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:23,365
Oh, no!

451
00:34:32,549 --> 00:34:33,924
You idiot!

452
00:34:34,051 --> 00:34:36,090
Excuse me!

453
00:34:45,772 --> 00:34:48,098
He shouldn't be taking advantage
of a girl like you.

454
00:34:48,233 --> 00:34:52,362
He's not. And besides, l'm not
a girl. You don't understand.

455
00:34:52,613 --> 00:34:56,612
Slow down! Slow down!

456
00:34:57,118 --> 00:34:58,577
Slow down.

457
00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:07,664
Nice skiing there, Andy.

458
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,176
- That's not funny.
- You wanted me to slow down.

459
00:35:15,306 --> 00:35:17,512
Oh, my God, this is insane.

460
00:35:19,268 --> 00:35:21,475
What are you doing?

461
00:35:21,604 --> 00:35:23,644
[foghorn]
Go!

462
00:35:24,065 --> 00:35:26,557
Go! Go!

463
00:35:26,693 --> 00:35:28,567
Allez! Allez!

464
00:35:28,696 --> 00:35:31,187
Go! Go!

465
00:35:31,324 --> 00:35:33,530
You really are a child!
You know that?

466
00:36:00,899 --> 00:36:02,975

636
00:47:50,490 --> 00:47:54,073
You don't understand what he's like

Come here.

Nicole,

675
00:49:54,713 --> 00:49:58,083
- You don't love me any more!
- How can you say that?

676

lt's true, you don't.

677
00:49:59,886 --> 00:50:02,258
You're going to marry lsabel
and live with her.

678
00:50:02,389 --> 00:50:04,927
You'll have other kids
and you won't need me.

679
00:50:05,058 --> 00:50:07,135
- l will always need you.
- No, you won't.

680

681
00:50:09,438 --> 00:50:10,981
l won't be your daughter any more.

682
00:50:11,107 --> 00:50:13,859
You'll just disappear again
and forget about me.

683
00:50:13,985 --> 00:50:16,477
When have l ever forgotten about you?
Tell me when.

684
00:50:16,613 --> 00:50:19,780
My thirteenth birthday.
You forgot about me then.

685
00:50:21,744 --> 00:50:24,414
You were in New York with her.
With lsabel.

686
00:50:24,539 --> 00:50:26,745
How did you know she was with me?

687
00:50:26,875 --> 00:50:29,081
You were supposed to come
to my birthday party.

688
00:50:29,211 --> 00:50:31,250
Mom said you couldn't
'cause you were sick.

689
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:34,915
l was worried about you,
so l made soup for you.

690
00:50:36,093 --> 00:50:38,133
A soup! Oh!

691
00:50:39,264 --> 00:50:40,758
You did?

692
00:50:40,891 --> 00:50:44,177
l took it down to the hotel by
myself, but you weren't in your room,

693
00:50:44,311 --> 00:50:47,597
so l waited for you in the lobby
all afternoon.

694
00:50:47,732 --> 00:50:51,564
And then l saw you and her coming off
the elevator and you weren't sick.

695
00:50:51,694 --> 00:50:53,189
Oh!

696
00:50:53,321 --> 00:50:56,406
Nicole. My God.
Why didn't you tell me this?

697
00:50:56,533 --> 00:50:58,193
lt'll get even worse now.

698
00:50:58,327 --> 00:51:00,154
You've never been there for me.

699
00:51:00,287 --> 00:51:03,242
You'll marry lsabel
and forget l existed.

700
00:51:03,374 --> 00:51:05,082
Oh, Nicole. Oh, God, Nicole.

forget you. How could l?

l love you
more than anything in the world.

704
00:51:15,388 --> 00:51:17,381
You are
the most precious thing to me.

705
00:51:19,267 --> 00:51:21,640

00:55:50,490 --> 00:55:53,989
l mean, look at yourself.
You're old enough to be her father.

778
00:55:56,204 --> 00:55:58,244
The truth is cruel.

779
00:55:58,373 --> 00:56:00,165
ls that what you came to tell me?

780
00:56:00,292 --> 00:56:02,332
l came to tell you
she's leaving you.

781
00:56:02,461 --> 00:56:04,703
And where is she going?

782
00:56:04,839 --> 00:56:06,713
She's going to stay at my house.

783
00:56:06,841 --> 00:56:09,759
My parents said it's OK. Then
she's gonna go back to New York,

784
00:56:09,886 --> 00:56:13,338
and we're gonna find her a place
to live until she finishes school.

785
00:56:13,474 --> 00:56:14,754
What about her parents?

786
00:56:14,892 --> 00:56:19,056
She told me her father's doing time
for armed robbery.

787
00:56:19,189 --> 00:56:22,475
Uh, right. l keep forgetting that.

788
00:56:24,236 --> 00:56:26,359
- And her mother?
- She's a prostitute.

789
00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:30,445
- l bet she ran away with her pimp.
- Yeah. She told you?

790
00:56:30,576 --> 00:56:32,653
Wild guess.

791
00:56:32,787 --> 00:56:35,788
lt's gonna be tough, but l'll be
there to help her through it.

792
00:56:37,376 --> 00:56:40,294
- How do l fit in?
- You don't. She's finished with you.

793
00:56:40,421 --> 00:56:42,627
Oh. You drive a hard bargain.

794
00:56:44,384 --> 00:56:46,792
What makes you think
l'm going to give her up?

795
00:56:46,928 --> 00:56:49,051
From what she's told me about you,

796
00:56:49,181 --> 00:56:52,515
in spite of everything, deep down,
she thinks you're an OK guy.

797
00:56:52,768 --> 00:56:56,220
- l'm touched.
- ln your own way you love her.

798
00:56:57,231 --> 00:56:59,770
Yes, l do.
ln my own way, very much so.

799
00:57:02,654 --> 00:57:05,572
But what about youDo you love her?

800
00:57:06,367 --> 00:57:08,407
ln your own way, of course?

801
00:57:11,289 --> 00:57:13,329
Yes, l do.

802
00:57:13,458 --> 00:57:16,993
l want to take care of her. Make
sure nothing else bad happens to her.

803
00:57:18,839 --> 00:57:21,330
What does Nicole think about
these plans of yours?

804
00:57:23,636 --> 00:57:29,260
- l haven't discussed them with her.
- NoWell, l suggest you do.

805
00:57:29,393 --> 00:57:31,432
After all, she has a say in this.

806
00:57:32,897 --> 00:57:34,272
Well, yeah, l know that.

807
00:57:34,398 --> 00:57:37,565
Good. Then, wait here.
She should be back soon.

808
00:57:37,694 --> 00:57:42,072
l'll go along with whatever
she decides. l'm going for a swim.

809
00:57:58,259 --> 00:58:00,584
Good to see you. How's it going?

810
00:58:09,521 --> 00:58:12,641
Thanks a lot. l was stuck
in that closet for half an hour.

811
00:58:12,775 --> 00:58:14,934
He finally went out
and l pretended to come in.

812
00:58:15,069 --> 00:58:17,311
Ah. How did it go?

813
00:58:17,447 --> 00:58:20,117
He's impressed by you.
He thinks you're a great guy.

814
00:58:20,242 --> 00:58:22,947
- What a relief!
- l told him l'm staying with you.

815
00:58:24,038 --> 00:58:25,117
lsn't he jealous?

816
00:58:25,247 --> 00:58:27,324
l told him
there's nothing to be jealous of.

817
00:58:27,458 --> 00:58:31,408
That there's nothing between us
any more because of...

818
00:58:31,546 --> 00:58:34,298
Promise you won't get mad?

819
00:58:34,424 --> 00:58:36,916
Why do l get so frightened
every time you ask me that?

820
00:58:37,052 --> 00:58:39,010
Because of your heart.

821
00:58:39,138 --> 00:58:41,178
My heartWhat about my heart?

822
00:58:41,307 --> 00:58:44,261
- l told him you were dying.
- l'm <i>dying</i> now?

823
00:58:44,394 --> 00:58:48,606
Daddy! l told him l had to stay
with you for your final days.

824
00:58:48,732 --> 00:58:51,354
My final days?
What's the matter with you?

825
00:58:51,485 --> 00:58:55,566
When l start lying, l can't stop.
lt's kind of addictive.

826
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:59,743
- What am l dying of?
- A disease you caught in Africa.

827
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:03,239
- When was l in Africa?
- During the Hundred Years War.

828
00:59:03,374 --> 00:59:06,992
The Hundred Years War
was in the Middle Ages, in Europe.

829
00:59:08,713 --> 00:59:10,338
He didn't seem to notice.

830
00:59:10,465 --> 00:59:12,505
Why not the Crusades?

831
00:59:25,941 --> 00:59:29,773
You think l'm stupid. Why didn't you
tell me you wanted to stay with him,

832
00:59:29,904 --> 00:59:32,193
instead of making up some stupid lie?

833
00:59:32,323 --> 00:59:34,861
- What are you talking about?
- Andre is not sick.

834
00:59:35,034 --> 00:59:36,445
He is, too, sick.

835
00:59:36,578 --> 00:59:39,864
Then how come he's out there
riding a jet ski like some crazy man?

836
00:59:41,625 --> 00:59:45,077
- You don't understand anything.
- What don't l understand?

837
00:59:45,212 --> 00:59:47,039
That's how his disease works.

838
00:59:47,173 --> 00:59:48,371
One day he's healthy.

839
00:59:48,508 --> 00:59:52,043
The next, he's like a limp doll,
lying around the house drooling.

840
00:59:52,179 --> 00:59:55,299
Last night, he...
Last night, he... he...

841
00:59:55,432 --> 00:59:57,342
He what?

842
00:59:57,476 --> 00:59:59,968
He fell asleep in the tub
and almost drowned.

843
01:00:00,104 --> 01:00:02,144
Sometimes you really are a child.

844
01:00:04,109 --> 01:00:06,149
Slump down a little more.

845
01:00:07,112 --> 01:00:09,235
- Like this?
- More.

846
01:00:11,325 --> 01:00:12,950
OK, now lean over.

847
01:00:13,077 --> 01:00:14,655
- [moans]
- Better.

848
01:00:14,787 --> 01:00:16,994
Can you believe he called me a liar?

849
01:00:17,123 --> 01:00:19,163
Oh, the nerve!

850
01:00:19,293 --> 01:00:23,338
- You don't look sick enough.
- l feel sick, believe me.

851
01:00:23,464 --> 01:00:25,836
- Oh, what's that?
- Sweat. You have a fever.

852
01:00:25,967 --> 01:00:29,383
Stop. You're soaking me.
How long must l do this?

853
01:00:29,512 --> 01:00:33,096
- Not much longer, Daddy. Please.
- [Ben] Niki?

854
01:00:33,225 --> 01:00:35,265
[moans]

855
01:00:35,394 --> 01:00:37,885
Don't overdo it.
Remember, you're a tough guy.

856
01:00:38,022 --> 01:00:39,849
Yeah, l'm a tough guy.

857
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:41,896
- Hi.
- Hi.

858
01:00:42,026 --> 01:00:43,189
Hello.

859
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:46,487
- Aren't you feeling well?
- Fine. Argh!

860
01:00:46,615 --> 01:00:49,782
- What is it?
- Nothing. Let's go.

861
01:00:49,910 --> 01:00:52,199
[groans] Just an old war wound.

862
01:00:52,330 --> 01:00:54,655
- A war wound?
- A piece of shrapnel.

863
01:00:54,791 --> 01:00:57,329
From a landmine
planted by revolutionaries.

864
01:00:57,461 --> 01:01:02,538
Blew a hole in my intestine
the size of a grapefruit.

865
01:01:02,675 --> 01:01:04,798
[moans]

866
01:01:06,638 --> 01:01:12,474
lt really hurt. A witch doctor
treated me. The wound never healed.

867
01:01:14,396 --> 01:01:17,563
Those were the days.
Memories, memories!

868
01:01:18,276 --> 01:01:20,518
- Let's go.
- Well, wait, wait, wait.

869
01:01:20,653 --> 01:01:23,026
l feel terrible
just leaving you here like this.

870
01:01:23,156 --> 01:01:25,482
Maybe we should stay
and have dinner together.

871
01:01:25,617 --> 01:01:26,993
- Oh, yes.
[Nicole] No!

872
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:30,571
No, no.
No, l already ordered some broth.

873
01:01:30,706 --> 01:01:34,407
l eat that, throw up
and watch some TV. No, you go.

874
01:01:35,378 --> 01:01:38,333
You two go, have fun.
Don't worry about me.

875
01:01:40,384 --> 01:01:41,713
[moans]

876
01:01:42,762 --> 01:01:44,801
[screams]

877
01:01:54,441 --> 01:01:58,487
l feel so bad for him, laying there
all by himself in that little room.

878
01:01:58,613 --> 01:02:02,563
- He likes it like that.
- He's had an amazing life.

879
01:02:02,701 --> 01:02:05,655
Yeah, it's more amazing
every day.

880
01:02:07,790 --> 01:02:11,491
lsabel, l've been thinking
about what you said.

881
01:02:11,627 --> 01:02:14,333
But l have been distracted by things
here.

882
01:02:14,464 --> 01:02:16,706
Nicole thinks
she's in love with a boy.

883
01:02:17,926 --> 01:02:20,382
A nice boy.

884
01:02:20,513 --> 01:02:23,798
l feel like smashing his head against
the wall every time l see him,

885
01:02:23,933 --> 01:02:26,305
but he's a very nice boy.

886
01:02:27,562 --> 01:02:31,940
<i>She's made up some ridiculous story</i>
<i>which, oh no, I can't explain it now.</i>

887
01:02:32,943 --> 01:02:36,811
<i>I wish you would answer the phone.</i>
<i>I need your advice.</i>

888
01:02:38,449 --> 01:02:40,738
<i>Isabel, do you hear me?</i>

889
01:02:41,995 --> 01:02:44,533
<i>I need you.</i>

890
01:02:59,682 --> 01:03:00,678
[knocks]

891
01:03:01,475 --> 01:03:06,434
- Niki said you weren't feeling well.
- l'm dying! Didn't she tell you?

892
01:03:06,564 --> 01:03:09,138
l'm sorry.
l thought we were going to the dance.

893
01:03:09,276 --> 01:03:11,269
l waited for you,
but you never showed up.

894
01:03:11,403 --> 01:03:14,191
l wasn't there for you either.
ls that what you're saying?

895
01:03:14,323 --> 01:03:15,866
What?

896
01:03:15,992 --> 01:03:19,942
l'm not there for Nicole, for lsabel,
for you, l am never there!

897
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:24,078
Wherever l am, l am never there!
Where l am?

898
01:03:24,793 --> 01:03:29,539
What l am doing so wrongl wish
all of you would leave me alone.

899
01:03:32,469 --> 01:03:33,465
Diana!

900
01:03:34,346 --> 01:03:36,303
Diana! Diana!

901
01:03:36,431 --> 01:03:39,302
Diana, wait! Diana, please wait.

902
01:03:42,146 --> 01:03:43,178
Diana!

903
01:03:43,314 --> 01:03:46,315
So this is what he does for exercise.

904
01:03:47,277 --> 01:03:48,771
Wait! Let me explain, Diana.

905
01:03:48,904 --> 01:03:50,184
Oh, merde!

906
01:03:51,824 --> 01:03:53,864
There <i>is</i> a God!

907
01:03:55,703 --> 01:03:57,743
You look so funny.

908
01:04:01,835 --> 01:04:03,875
Animal!

909
01:04:04,004 --> 01:04:07,005
Look how they stare at me!
The pariah.

910
01:04:07,133 --> 01:04:09,920
They should know what a good father
you've been to Niki.

911
01:04:10,053 --> 01:04:12,046
- You think l am?
- Yes, l do.

912
01:04:12,180 --> 01:04:15,181
Oh, that's good to hear.
Sometimes l am not sure.

913
01:04:16,769 --> 01:04:20,897
l don't know if a good father would
keep up the lie for his daughter.

914
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:26,144
No, l can't pretend any more.
l'm going to tell him the truth.

915
01:04:26,279 --> 01:04:30,278
The KGB was on our tail.
We were doomed, for sure.

916
01:04:30,409 --> 01:04:33,196
The railroad
was our only chance of escape.

917
01:04:33,329 --> 01:04:37,956
Our train was sliding down the icy
tracks of the Ural mountains.

918
01:04:38,084 --> 01:04:41,454
Suddenly,
in front of us was a boulder.

919
01:04:41,588 --> 01:04:45,800
- And the engineer swerved.
- Trains don't swerve.

920
01:04:45,926 --> 01:04:48,928
l wish
someone had told the engineer that.

921
01:04:49,055 --> 01:04:52,259
- Hi.
- Ben came to see how l was feeling.

922
01:04:52,392 --> 01:04:54,634
- lsn't it nice of him?
- Charming.

923
01:04:54,770 --> 01:04:57,854
Andre was telling me about his
years in Russia. Unbelievable!

924
01:04:57,982 --> 01:04:59,559
Yeah, they are.

925
01:04:59,692 --> 01:05:03,026
Sweetheart, would you mind
getting us a couple of beers?

926
01:05:06,074 --> 01:05:09,408
Did l tell you about the time l swam
in the Yangtze with Chairman Mao?

927
01:05:10,746 --> 01:05:12,656
No, but Niki mentioned Mount Everest.

928
01:05:12,790 --> 01:05:15,460

01:18:25,225 --> 01:18:29,009
- They make my heart soar.
- They make my heart soar.

1083
01:18:30,523 --> 01:18:33,477
- Why should l believe you?
- Because it's true, you idiot.

1084
01:18:33,609 --> 01:18:35,483
Because it's true, you idiot!

1085
01:18:36,446 --> 01:18:38,605

- Sorry.

1086
01:18:38,740 --> 01:18:42,988

- l know l haven't been perfect.

1087
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:45,327
l know l haven't been perfect.

1088
01:18:45,456 --> 01:18:47,994
- But who is?
- But who is?

1089
01:18:48,126 --> 01:18:51,910
- Forgive me, please.
- Forgive me. Please.

1090
01:18:53,465 --> 01:18:55,007
Why should l?

1091
01:18:55,134 --> 01:18:57,839
Because l cannot imagine my world
without you in it.

1092
01:18:57,970 --> 01:19:02,300
Because... l cannot imagine my world
without you in it.

1093
01:19:03,393 --> 01:19:06,893
- And...

He's smiling. l think he's buying it.

1097
01:19:17,784 --> 01:19:19,576
Ah...

1098
01:19:22,206 --> 01:19:24,163
Maybe l'll see you
at the dance later.

1099
01:19:26,461 --> 01:19:28,418
OK. Later.

1100
01:19:34,929 --> 01:19:37,218
- Let's go.
- Do you think it worked?

1101
01:19:37,348 --> 01:19:39,388
Oh, we'll see, we'll see.

1102
01:19:44,690 --> 01:19:46,979
Where did you come up
with that stuff, anyway?

1103
01:19:47,109 --> 01:19:48,438
What stuff?

1104
01:19:48,569 --> 01:19:53,730
Your eyes, your hands, you make
my heart soar. lt was so lame.

1105
01:20:01,166 --> 01:20:02,661
Nicole, please.

1106
01:20:02,793 --> 01:20:04,833

1109
01:20:23,483 --> 01:20:26,734
Beautiful. Glorious. Enchanting.

1110
01:20:27,738 --> 01:20:29,565
That's better.

1111
01:20:29,740 --> 01:20:32,944
lsland boy, you know my heart
is still in the Caribbean

1112

lsland boy,
l still hear my girlfriend say hey

1113
01:20:37,332 --> 01:20:41,662
Come back home
to the land of the balmy beaches

1114
01:20:41,796 --> 01:20:45,628
Where you heart has always been
since the very first day

1115
01:20:45,758 --> 01:20:49,922
l hear cowbells and the drums
on New Year's morning

1116
01:20:50,055 --> 01:20:54,302
And l smell hibiscus
in the tropic skies above

1117
01:20:54,435 --> 01:20:58,303
Look at the boats,
and the conchfish at dawning

1118
01:20:58,439 --> 01:21:00,231
l know that it's Nassau...

1119
01:21:00,358 --> 01:21:03,313
Bonsoir. Vous paraissez tres
constipée, ce soir.

1120
01:21:08,284 --> 01:21:11,071
- What did he say?
- Who cares?

1121
01:21:11,204 --> 01:21:13,410
Hey, hey, hey, Andy!

1122
01:21:13,540 --> 01:21:15,248
We got a question for you.

1123
01:21:15,375 --> 01:21:17,831
OK, you're in France
and you want French toast.

1124
01:21:17,961 --> 01:21:20,453
Do you say toast,
or do you have to say French toast?

1125
01:21:20,589 --> 01:21:21,965
How would he know?

1126
01:21:22,091 --> 01:21:25,959
Me donnez votre addresse, parce que
si par malchance je vais à Scranton,

1127
01:21:26,096 --> 01:21:28,468
j'ai merais bein eviter votre rue.

1128
01:21:28,598 --> 01:21:31,350
Whoa! Vive la France!

1129
01:21:34,355 --> 01:21:36,514
Hey! Hi, guys. Hello, how are you?

1130
01:21:42,155 --> 01:21:44,528
Daddy, he's not... He's not here.

1131
01:21:44,658 --> 01:21:46,817
Give him time, darling.
Give him time.

1132
01:21:47,787 --> 01:21:50,076
But l'll die if l don't see him.

1133
01:21:50,206 --> 01:21:51,617
Andre, Niki, hi!

1134
01:21:51,749 --> 01:21:55,534
This is Gina. Her father's
an economics professor at Stanford.

1135
01:21:55,879 --> 01:21:59,046
- lnternational finance.
- Nice to meet you, Gina.

1136
01:21:59,174 --> 01:22:02,674
- Pretty good, huh?
- Yeah, you make a perfect couple.

1137
01:22:02,804 --> 01:22:04,761
Go off and have boring children.

1138
01:22:25,704 --> 01:22:28,955
Many nights l sit here

1139
01:22:29,792 --> 01:22:33,873
- With memories by the score
- He's not coming.

1140
01:22:34,005 --> 01:22:36,045
Come on, let's dance, huh?

1141
01:22:36,633 --> 01:22:40,299
Thinking of the days l spent

1142
01:22:40,429 --> 01:22:45,222
With the girl l still adore

1143
01:22:45,352 --> 01:22:51,022
So l'm going back to see her...

1144
01:22:51,150 --> 01:22:55,065
- Daddy, what if he doesn't come?
- Then he doesn't deserve you.

1145
01:22:58,825 --> 01:23:00,865
You're the greatest, Daddy.

1146
01:23:00,994 --> 01:23:04,494
And you were right. This was
the best vacation l've ever had.

1147
01:23:05,541 --> 01:23:07,035
Me, too.

1148
01:23:07,168 --> 01:23:09,208
..and sun

1149
01:23:16,762 --> 01:23:20,381
Once l had a notion

1150
01:23:20,516 --> 01:23:25,428
About this Nassau girl

1151
01:23:25,564 --> 01:23:27,106
Daddy, he's here.

1152
01:23:27,232 --> 01:23:31,729
l put my thoughts in motion

1153
01:23:31,862 --> 01:23:36,359
And found my heart in a whirl

1154
01:23:36,492 --> 01:23:37,524
l see.

1155
01:23:37,660 --> 01:23:41,362
So l'm going back to see her

1156
01:23:41,498 --> 01:23:42,779
Go on.

1157
01:23:42,916 --> 01:23:48,291
Before my days are done

1158
01:23:48,423 --> 01:23:51,958
Going back to see her

1159
01:23:52,093 --> 01:23:55,048
ln the land

1160
01:23:55,180 --> 01:24:02,429
Of the sea and sun

1161
01:24:10,447 --> 01:24:14,113
Ever since l left her

1162
01:24:15,787 --> 01:24:19,737
Nothing has been the same

1163
01:24:21,084 --> 01:24:24,869
?l think l'll go and find her

1164
01:24:25,006 --> 01:24:30,463
l'm going back to give her my name

1165
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:36,307
Oh, many nights l sit here

1166
01:24:36,435 --> 01:24:41,311
With memories by the score

1167
01:24:43,151 --> 01:24:46,900
Thinking of the days l've spent

1168
01:24:47,030 --> 01:24:51,859
With the girl l still adore

1169
01:24:51,994 --> 01:24:57,072
Yes, l'm going back to see her

1170
01:24:57,918 --> 01:25:03,339
Before my days are done

1171
01:25:03,466 --> 01:25:07,678
Going back to see her

1172
01:25:07,804 --> 01:25:15,183
ln the land of the sea and sun

1173
01:25:15,312 --> 01:25:17,471
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>if I'd call it a vacation,</i>

1174
01:25:17,606 --> 01:25:20,561
<i>but it was the most incredible</i>
<i>ten days in my life.</i>

1175
01:25:21,486 --> 01:25:25,436
l think Nicole has taught me
more than l could ever teach her.

1176
01:25:25,574 --> 01:25:29,275
l have thought about what you said,
and l have made a decision.

1177
01:25:30,454 --> 01:25:33,456
<i>I want to marry you.</i>
<i>That is, if you want to marry me.</i>

1178
01:25:36,544 --> 01:25:37,825
Andre?

1179
01:25:37,963 --> 01:25:39,457
- <i>Isabel?</i>
- Yes.

1180
01:25:39,590 --> 01:25:44,715

day. Were you listening just now?

1181
01:25:45,555 --> 01:25:48,342
- Yes.
- What did you hear?

1182
01:25:48,850 --> 01:25:51,851
l heard you ask me to marry you.

1183
01:25:52,604 --> 01:25:54,431
Good. There is something else, too.

ls there?

1185
01:26:00,530 --> 01:26:03,816
l want to have a child with you.
So what do you say?

1186
01:26:04,952 --> 01:26:08,403
l say, you're getting very demanding
all of a sudden.

1187
01:26:08,539 --> 01:26:10,496
ls there anything else you want?

1188
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,788
Yes. Make sure it's a girl.

1189
01:26:45,706 --> 01:26:50,167
<i>Oh, Father, please believe in me</i>

1194
01:27:16,866 --> 01:27:21,445
<i>Just for this moment,</i>

<i>I need to know you're there for me</i>

<i>That you are ready to let me go</i>

1198
