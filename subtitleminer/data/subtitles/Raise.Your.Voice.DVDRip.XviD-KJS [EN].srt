Jeremiah was a bullfrog...   
     Bullfrog

2
00:00:42,408 --> 00:00:44,103
Was a good friend
of mine

3
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:45,805
Was a good
friend of mine

4
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:48,542
Never understood
a single word he said

5
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:52,018
But I helped him drink his wine   
     Oh my, my

6
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,020
Yes, he always had
some mighty fine wine

7
00:00:54,055 --> 00:00:55,215
So fine

All the boys and girls   
     All the boys and girls

10
00:01:02,064 --> 00:01:05,295
Joy to the fishes
in the deep blue sea

11
00:01:05,334 --> 00:01:08,326
Joy to you and me

12
00:01:08,372 --> 00:01:11,933
If I were the king of the world   
     King of the world

13
00:01:11,975 --> 00:01:15,069
I tell you what I'd do   
     I tell you what I'd do

14
00:01:15,113 --> 00:01:18,344
I'd throw away the cars
and the bars and the wars

15
00:01:18,383 --> 00:01:21,477
And make sweet love to you   
     Sweet love

00:01:59,998 --> 00:02:00,930
Big ending!

00:02:00,966 --> 00:02:06,996
Joy to you and me!

31
00:02:12,011 --> 00:02:13,979
Have a very pleasant
summer everyone.

32
00:02:14,014 --> 00:02:16,073
Ms. Fletcher, rehearsal tomorrow
at 4:00.

33
00:02:16,116 --> 00:02:18,812
Oh, and I did send in that
recommendation you requested.

34
00:02:18,852 --> 00:02:20,649
Oh, thank you,
Mr. Holcombe. Bye.

35
00:02:20,688 --> 00:02:22,815
Are you actually
going tomorrow?

36
00:02:22,857 --> 00:02:24,848
Call me a dork,
but I love choir practice.

37
00:02:24,893 --> 00:02:26,417
And I don't want
to let him down.

38
00:02:26,461 --> 00:02:28,429
All right, last day!

39
00:02:28,464 --> 00:02:30,125
Hey, Terri, hey, Terri.
  Hey, Matthew.

40
00:02:30,165 --> 00:02:32,133
Hey.

41
00:02:32,167 --> 00:02:34,465
I, uh, I got the concert tickets
that you wanted.

42
00:02:34,504 --> 00:02:36,028
Oh, um,
I've got the money.

43
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:38,040
Awesome.
  There you go.

44
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:39,336
So, um,

45
00:02:39,376 --> 00:02:41,367
I'll see you
at rehearsal then.

46
00:02:41,412 --> 00:02:43,903
Okay, cool.
See you then.

47
00:02:46,851 --> 00:02:49,786
Okay.

48
00:02:49,821 --> 00:02:51,345
Oh my God!

49
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:53,358
He's going to spend
the whole next month

50
00:02:53,392 --> 00:02:55,360
hoping he didn't just
get you pregnant.

51
00:02:55,395 --> 00:02:57,761
Oh, shut up.
He's so nice.

52
00:02:57,797 --> 00:03:00,357
Play it loud

53
00:03:01,368 --> 00:03:04,769
Play it loud

54
00:03:04,805 --> 00:03:07,569
Raise your voice

55
00:03:07,609 --> 00:03:12,137
Shout it out

56
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,274
We weren't the first

57
00:03:15,318 --> 00:03:19,812
But we're
holding our own...

58
00:03:19,855 --> 00:03:22,517
As hordes of
summer starved teenagers

59
00:03:22,559 --> 00:03:25,790
descend on unsuspecting
Flagstaff, Arizona,

60
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:28,297
Iet's see what these two
poised young women

61
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,426
have to say about
the last day of school!

62
00:03:30,468 --> 00:03:34,268
I'm outta here, Riverdale!
  Yeah, school's out, baby!

63
00:03:34,306 --> 00:03:37,332
All right.
The camera loves you.

64
00:03:37,376 --> 00:03:39,469
So, Lauren, what are
you doing tonight?

65
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:41,138
Paul, stop hitting
on my friend.

66
00:03:41,181 --> 00:03:43,081
Whatever you're
doing tonight.

67
00:03:43,116 --> 00:03:45,141
Lauren, stop hitting
on my brother. Ugh!

68
00:03:45,185 --> 00:03:46,675
Hey, would you tell Mom
I'll be late?

69
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,483
But it's your graduation
barbecue.

70
00:03:48,522 --> 00:03:52,049
I've got places to go, people to see.
Just save me a burnt burger.

71
00:03:52,093 --> 00:03:54,084
Will you give me a ride home?
  Sure.

72
00:03:54,128 --> 00:03:56,392
Play it loud

73
00:03:57,666 --> 00:04:00,658
Play it loud

74
00:04:00,702 --> 00:04:04,331
Raise your voice

75
00:04:04,374 --> 00:04:07,935
Shout it out

76
00:04:07,978 --> 00:04:10,469
Play it loud

77
00:04:11,482 --> 00:04:14,940
Play it loud

78
00:04:14,986 --> 00:04:18,319
Raise your voice

79
00:04:18,356 --> 00:04:22,087
Shout it out

80
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:25,564
Play it loud

81
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,566
Play it loud...

82
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,568
Thanks, Lauren.
  Anytime.

83
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:32,299
Hey, I'll call you tomorrow.
  Okay, have fun tonight.

84
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:35,433
Play it loud.

85
00:04:39,514 --> 00:04:42,347
So, Terri Boo berry,
what are you up to this summer?

86
00:04:42,384 --> 00:04:44,318
I'm singing in choir.
  Cool.

87
00:04:44,353 --> 00:04:47,083
Yeah, and, um, I'm working
at the restaurant again.

88
00:04:47,122 --> 00:04:49,022
Wow, what fun.
  Yeah.

89
00:04:49,059 --> 00:04:52,517
But mostly, I really want to get into
this music summer program in August.

90
00:04:52,562 --> 00:04:55,929
Really, which one?
  Some music thing in L.A.

91
00:04:55,966 --> 00:04:59,663
Dad! Come on! It's not
just some music thing in L.A.

92
00:04:59,703 --> 00:05:02,001
It's Bristol Hillman
Music Conservatory.

93
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,508
Only the best summer music
program on the West Coast,

94
00:05:04,543 --> 00:05:07,034
maybe even in the whole country.
  Terri, don't start.

95
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:10,446
But Dad, this is
so important to me.

96
00:05:10,483 --> 00:05:12,883
Plus, I already sent
in my application and I sent a CD

97
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:15,854
because Mom said I could.
  That's it! You're not going!

98
00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:20,383
Simon, don't be so closed minded.
  Nina, please.

99
00:05:23,131 --> 00:05:26,032
Terri...

100
00:05:26,067 --> 00:05:28,763
Where've you been?
  Hanging out with some of the guys.

101
00:05:28,804 --> 00:05:32,467
Saying goodbye, that stuff.
Hey, Aunt Nina!

102
00:05:32,508 --> 00:05:34,840
Happy graduation.
  Thanks.

103
00:05:34,877 --> 00:05:36,742
Here.
  Oh here, I'll take it in.

104
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,771
Hey, what's wrong?

105
00:05:38,815 --> 00:05:42,774
Terri just wants to go
to this great music program in L.A.

106
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:47,018
and your Dad's being his usual
squash any good idea self.

107
00:05:47,058 --> 00:05:50,494
Nina, the prettiest girls
from all the high schools go to L.A.

108
00:05:50,529 --> 00:05:52,360
You know what happens
to most of them?

109
00:05:52,397 --> 00:05:55,389
Dad, you don't think Terri's special?
  Paul, seriously.

110
00:05:55,434 --> 00:05:58,130
I think she's the most special
human being on the planet.

111
00:05:58,171 --> 00:06:00,139
She's my girl.

112
00:06:00,173 --> 00:06:01,834
That's why she's
not going to L.A.

113
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:04,435
She's 16, for God's sakes.
What's wrong with you people?

114
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:07,379
Hundreds of people
apply for this.

115
00:06:07,414 --> 00:06:10,611
If she gets in, it's proof she belongs
there, but you get that, right?

116
00:06:10,652 --> 00:06:13,120
Look, when I was your age,
I thought I knew everything too.

117
00:06:13,155 --> 00:06:15,521
But I've seen a lot more of the world
than you have, Paul.

118
00:06:15,557 --> 00:06:17,787
What parts of the world
have you seen, Dad?

119
00:06:17,827 --> 00:06:20,125
The back and front
of your dad's restaurant?

120
00:06:20,163 --> 00:06:21,892
Okay, okay.
Paul, that's enough.

121
00:06:21,931 --> 00:06:24,525
Well, just because you're stuck
here, you want everyone stuck with you.

122
00:06:24,568 --> 00:06:26,593
You better watch your mouth
or you're gonna get grounded.

123
00:06:26,637 --> 00:06:30,733
All right, listen.
Can we please stop fighting?

124
00:06:30,775 --> 00:06:34,472
It's a graduation party.
We're suppose to be celebrating here.

125
00:06:34,512 --> 00:06:36,480
All right?

126
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:40,278
I can't get
these damn coals to light.

127
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,446
Oh, well here, try this.
  What are you doing?

128
00:06:42,488 --> 00:06:46,117
God. Stop. That's it!
You're grounded! Get in the house.

129
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:48,957
I just love our family get-togethers.
  Uh, I'll be back.

130
00:06:48,995 --> 00:06:51,361
Always have.

131
00:07:05,281 --> 00:07:07,681
So...

132
00:07:07,717 --> 00:07:12,211
I never got a chance to tell you
congratulations on Arizona State.

133
00:07:12,256 --> 00:07:16,090
Thanks.
At least I'm getting outta here.

134
00:07:16,126 --> 00:07:19,960
Aunt Nina, if Terri gets
into that music program,

135
00:07:19,998 --> 00:07:21,863
you gotta make sure
she goes.

136
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,028
She'll suffocate staying here.
  Yeah, I know.

137
00:07:25,071 --> 00:07:27,164
I was thinking
the same thing.

138
00:07:30,744 --> 00:07:33,679
So you're on my side?

139
00:07:33,714 --> 00:07:35,705
Always.

140
00:07:38,019 --> 00:07:39,509
Hey.

141
00:07:39,554 --> 00:07:41,044
What's going on?

142
00:07:41,089 --> 00:07:42,716
Nothing.
  Nothing.

143
00:07:42,757 --> 00:07:44,384
Yeah, right.

144
00:07:47,663 --> 00:07:50,689
There's a light in me

145
00:07:50,734 --> 00:07:53,862
And it's shining bright

146
00:07:53,903 --> 00:07:59,136
I can almost
touch the sky...

147
00:07:59,176 --> 00:08:00,939
The sky.

148
00:08:00,978 --> 00:08:06,075
You're the reason
I believe...

149
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:07,983
Hello, annoying.

150
00:08:09,855 --> 00:08:11,755
Hey! Easy on the hardware.

151
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:14,919
What are you doing?
Filming America's most boring teenagers?

152
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,299
And I feel so strong...

153
00:08:28,743 --> 00:08:31,041
Ladies and gentlemen,

154
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,981
tonight on "The Fletcher Experience,"
we have a special treat.

155
00:08:34,016 --> 00:08:37,076
It's my sincere pleasure to present
to you the distinctive vocal stylings

156
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:40,316
of the one, the only,
Terri Fletcher!

157
00:08:40,357 --> 00:08:42,882
Oh, well, Paul, that is
so very kind of you. Thank you.

158
00:08:42,926 --> 00:08:45,451
This next song
I wrote for my fans.

159
00:08:45,496 --> 00:08:49,057
Something's got
ahold of me

160
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,365
But I will follow
where you go

161
00:08:52,404 --> 00:08:56,738
One more mile to Jericho

162
00:08:56,775 --> 00:08:58,766
The walls will tumble

163
00:08:58,812 --> 00:09:00,837
The walls will tumble

164
00:09:02,549 --> 00:09:05,074
The music fills the space

165
00:09:05,119 --> 00:09:08,782
And it takes the pain away

166
00:09:08,823 --> 00:09:13,089
And I know
it's gonna be all right.

167
00:09:14,463 --> 00:09:17,159
When you're sad and lonely

168
00:09:17,199 --> 00:09:19,997
Tell Him what you want

169
00:09:20,036 --> 00:09:23,665
Hold Him up and tell Him
what you want.

170
00:09:25,709 --> 00:09:28,872
'Cause I just can't wait
till you write me

171
00:09:28,912 --> 00:09:31,210
You're coming around   
     Around

172
00:09:33,084 --> 00:09:37,350
Now I'm walking
on sunshine, whoa oh

173
00:09:37,389 --> 00:09:41,519
And don't it feel good, hey!   
     Oh, yeah, now

174
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,790
And don't it feel good...

175
00:09:43,829 --> 00:09:46,093
Oh

176
00:10:06,556 --> 00:10:08,990
Hey, what are you
doing here?

177
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,789
Um, uh...

178
00:10:11,829 --> 00:10:15,526
With all the stuff
that went on this afternoon

179
00:10:15,566 --> 00:10:18,034
I almost forgot to give you
your graduation present.

180
00:10:18,068 --> 00:10:21,697
Three Days Grace?
  Yes.

181
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:24,072
Oh my God! When?

182
00:10:24,109 --> 00:10:26,373
It's tonight.

183
00:10:26,412 --> 00:10:29,677
Oh, no.

184
00:10:29,715 --> 00:10:31,683
Didn't you hear
I was grounded?

185
00:10:31,717 --> 00:10:35,585
Paul. Come on.
It's not like you never break the rules.

186
00:10:35,622 --> 00:10:39,149
If you don't go,
I can't go either.

187
00:10:39,194 --> 00:10:41,924
Please.
It's Three Days Grace.

188
00:10:41,963 --> 00:10:44,989
Side window? Should we go?
  Side window.

189
00:10:45,033 --> 00:10:46,625
All right.

190
00:10:48,771 --> 00:10:50,762
Quiet, quiet!

191
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:03,944
I can't believe
you sprung me.

192
00:11:03,988 --> 00:11:05,580
This is a first.

193
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:09,321
Well, who know when we'll ever
break the law again, right?

194
00:11:09,361 --> 00:11:12,489
I'm not, uh, staying
in Flagstaff Terri.

195
00:11:12,532 --> 00:11:14,363
I lined up a job
in Phoenix

196
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,335
and I'm going straight to Arizona State.
I'm not coming back.

197
00:11:19,106 --> 00:11:21,506
Just like that?
I mean...

198
00:11:21,542 --> 00:11:24,136
It's time.

199
00:11:24,178 --> 00:11:27,045
Dad and l...

200
00:11:27,082 --> 00:11:28,879
need...

201
00:11:28,917 --> 00:11:31,283
It's just time.

202
00:11:31,319 --> 00:11:33,378
The only thing I feel bad
about is leaving you here.

203
00:11:33,422 --> 00:11:36,653
No. You don't have to worry about me.
We get along okay.

204
00:11:36,692 --> 00:11:39,252
Yeah, that's what
worries me.

205
00:11:39,296 --> 00:11:41,958
It's more than getting along, Terri.
You please them.

206
00:11:41,999 --> 00:11:45,935
You're like a Stepford daughter out
of a mail order magazine.

207
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:49,462
Is that
a form of flattery?

208
00:11:49,507 --> 00:11:51,304
After Dad slammed you
on Bristol Hillman,

209
00:11:51,342 --> 00:11:52,741
you're going to tell me
that didn't hurt?

210
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:56,111
No, it totally hurt.
  Then make a scene!

211
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:59,413
Break something! Scream!
I... something.

212
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:01,852
Huh huh. Tantrums were
never my thing.

213
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:04,254
Terri, you've got the best
voice I've ever heard,

214
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:08,159
but if you hang with the "World
According to Simon Fletcher" any longer,

215
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:11,187
you're going
to be doing "Cats" at the Y at 40.

216
00:12:11,232 --> 00:12:14,030
And that would suck.

217
00:12:14,069 --> 00:12:15,798
That would suck.

218
00:12:15,837 --> 00:12:17,862
Home!

219
00:12:17,906 --> 00:12:22,570
This house
is not a home...

220
00:12:22,612 --> 00:12:27,549
Oh my God!
     This house is not a home.

221
00:12:36,261 --> 00:12:38,821
What's up, Flagstaff?
How you guys doing, all right?

222
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,668
Yeah.

223
00:12:57,719 --> 00:13:02,782
You said
we'd never get this far

224
00:13:02,825 --> 00:13:05,316
You said your words   
     Words

225
00:13:05,361 --> 00:13:07,591
We played our parts

226
00:13:07,631 --> 00:13:11,658
Said your two cents
now it's my turn

227
00:13:11,701 --> 00:13:15,535
So sit down, shut up,
are you ready?

228
00:13:15,573 --> 00:13:20,476
So you think you know

229
00:13:20,512 --> 00:13:23,310
How this story goes...   
  Little help?

230
00:13:23,348 --> 00:13:25,873
Are you ready for this?   
  Paul, don't   oh my God.

231
00:13:25,917 --> 00:13:27,782
Sit down!

232
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,481
Are you ready for this?

233
00:13:29,522 --> 00:13:31,990
Shut up!

234
00:13:32,025 --> 00:13:34,152
Are you ready for this?

235
00:13:34,194 --> 00:13:36,424
Stand up!

236
00:13:36,463 --> 00:13:38,795
Are you ready for this?

237
00:13:38,832 --> 00:13:40,732
This game

238
00:13:40,769 --> 00:13:42,760
Are you ready?

239
00:13:46,341 --> 00:13:48,775
Are you ready?

240
00:13:54,618 --> 00:13:57,086
Are you ready for this?

241
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,088
Sit down

242
00:13:59,122 --> 00:14:01,522
Are you ready for this?

243
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:03,584
Shut up

244
00:14:03,628 --> 00:14:06,096
Are you ready for this?

245
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:08,826
Stand straight!

246
00:14:08,867 --> 00:14:11,233
Are you ready?

247
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:13,135
Paul, Look out!

248
00:14:19,012 --> 00:14:23,005
Are you ready for this?

249
00:15:00,826 --> 00:15:03,090
Oh! Thank God.

250
00:15:13,641 --> 00:15:15,939
Paul?

251
00:15:17,379 --> 00:15:19,370
No.

252
00:15:25,255 --> 00:15:27,155
Healing nicely.

253
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:29,181
Still got that headache?

254
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:35,363
Can you tell me
your birthday?

255
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,368
April 20th.

256
00:15:37,402 --> 00:15:39,597
Let's let Terri
get the next one.

257
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:41,606
Tell me what month it is.

258
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:45,310
June.
  What's wrong with her?

259
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:46,436
Why can't she speak?

260
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:49,607
Terri, tell me what month
it is out loud.

261
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:52,118
It's June.

262
00:15:52,152 --> 00:15:54,120
That's good.

263
00:15:54,154 --> 00:15:56,145
Now follow this light
with your eyes.

264
00:16:02,965 --> 00:16:05,957
Doc, stop!
Whatever you're doing, just stop.

265
00:16:33,633 --> 00:16:36,466
I wish I was older.

266
00:16:36,503 --> 00:16:39,597
I'm so afraid I'll say something stupid
and make it worse.

267
00:17:38,074 --> 00:17:40,042
Hey, Aunt Nina.

268
00:17:40,076 --> 00:17:43,068
Hi, Terri Boo berry.

269
00:17:43,113 --> 00:17:44,842
Honey.

270
00:17:44,882 --> 00:17:48,477
Why was this in the trash?
  You got in.

271
00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:51,113
Congratulations.

272
00:17:51,156 --> 00:17:54,091
Paul would be so proud of you.
  Mom, what are you doing?

273
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:56,093
If Paul were here,
he would just get

274
00:17:56,127 --> 00:17:58,322
in another screaming fight
with Dad about it.

275
00:17:58,364 --> 00:18:00,491
Okay. Everything
is different now.

276
00:18:00,533 --> 00:18:04,094
Do you still want to go?
  I don't want to sing anymore.

277
00:18:04,137 --> 00:18:07,573
I don't believe that,
Terri.

278
00:18:10,244 --> 00:18:13,042
Why don't you let me
handle your Dad about this.

279
00:18:15,917 --> 00:18:19,045
I think Terri should come visit me.
  Hmm.

280
00:18:19,088 --> 00:18:21,454
Simon, I really think
she needs to get away

281
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:24,516
and I'd like her to come to Palm Desert
for the month of August.

282
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:28,361
A month with you,
alone in the desert? Are you nuts?

283
00:18:29,432 --> 00:18:31,491
It is alone, isn't it?

284
00:18:31,535 --> 00:18:34,663
I'm between guys right now.
So yes, I'm alone.

285
00:18:34,705 --> 00:18:37,173
Yeah, for the moment.

286
00:18:38,377 --> 00:18:40,368
Well who's going to help me
in the restaurant?

287
00:18:40,412 --> 00:18:42,505
Oh, is that really what
you want to say, Simon?

288
00:18:42,547 --> 00:18:45,175
"Who's gonna help me
with the restaurant?"

289
00:18:49,355 --> 00:18:52,153
Aunt Nina,
who said that you could do that?

290
00:18:52,192 --> 00:18:54,353
I've never lied
to my father before.

291
00:18:54,395 --> 00:18:56,761
Terri, I just think
this is your life.

292
00:18:56,797 --> 00:18:58,731
You deserve
the chance to live it.

293
00:18:58,767 --> 00:19:00,758
Then why
does it feel so wrong?

294
00:19:02,303 --> 00:19:04,271
There's something
about your dad

295
00:19:04,306 --> 00:19:06,069
that I don't think
you know.

296
00:19:06,108 --> 00:19:10,374
He and his friend David both got
football scholarships to UCLA.

297
00:19:10,413 --> 00:19:11,607
Really?

298
00:19:11,648 --> 00:19:13,775
And when graduation
rolled around,

299
00:19:13,817 --> 00:19:16,115
our family restaurant
was doing good,

300
00:19:16,153 --> 00:19:18,485
but our parents weren't.

301
00:19:18,523 --> 00:19:21,117
Neither of us
wanted the restaurant,

302
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:24,287
but your Dad felt he had
no choice but to take it.

303
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:28,129
And, uh, his friend David
went on to UCLA.

304
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,658
And he got caught up
in the L.A. scene

305
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:33,296
and he's been messed up
ever since.

306
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:35,307
But I know

307
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:37,673
that if your Dad had taken
that scholarship,

308
00:19:37,711 --> 00:19:41,010
he would have made it.

309
00:19:41,048 --> 00:19:44,074
So, what does that
have to do with me?

310
00:19:44,118 --> 00:19:46,279
I don't know.
Everything?

311
00:19:47,689 --> 00:19:50,487
But it's
your decision, Terri.

312
00:20:54,132 --> 00:20:57,158
He would have wanted
you to have this, honey.

313
00:20:57,202 --> 00:21:00,933
Paul would have wanted
you to have this.

314
00:21:00,973 --> 00:21:04,704
I shouldn't
have snuck him out.

315
00:21:04,744 --> 00:21:06,234
Oh, honey,
it's not your fault,

316
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:11,741
it's not your fault.
  I feel so bad all the time.

317
00:21:11,785 --> 00:21:13,776
No.

318
00:21:14,923 --> 00:21:17,915
I can't do this.

319
00:21:17,959 --> 00:21:20,427
I can't go.
I can't lie to Dad.

320
00:21:20,462 --> 00:21:22,760
It's just too soon.

321
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:24,766
Honey...

322
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,325
I will tell Dad that you're
really not at Nina's

323
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:29,338
when the time
is right.

324
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:32,136
And he's gonna be
mad at first.

325
00:21:32,176 --> 00:21:36,272
But he's gonna realize
it was the right thing to do.

326
00:21:36,314 --> 00:21:39,875
You sure it's the right thing to do?
  No.

327
00:21:39,918 --> 00:21:43,183
I'm not sure
of anything.

328
00:21:43,222 --> 00:21:45,588
I just want
you to be happy.

329
00:21:53,734 --> 00:21:55,702
Okay.

330
00:21:55,736 --> 00:21:57,328
I'll do it.

331
00:21:57,371 --> 00:21:59,965
Okay.

332
00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:17,456
Are you guys
gonna be okay?

333
00:22:17,494 --> 00:22:19,792
Yeah.
  Yeah. We'll be fine.

334
00:22:19,831 --> 00:22:21,799
Uh, I'm taking her
to the train station.

335
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:24,028
And, uh, Nina will pick her up
on the other end.

336
00:22:24,068 --> 00:22:28,061
We'll be fine.
  Here you go. This is for you.

337
00:22:30,709 --> 00:22:32,404
Dad.

338
00:22:32,444 --> 00:22:35,470
I don't want Nina to pay
for everything, and uh...

339
00:22:35,515 --> 00:22:37,779
You wanna come home early,
you call us, okay?

340
00:22:37,817 --> 00:22:40,251
Okay. I love you.

341
00:22:42,123 --> 00:22:44,114
Me too.

342
00:22:46,728 --> 00:22:49,128
Call me, okay?
  Okay.

343
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:14,254
I want you
to take this.

344
00:23:14,293 --> 00:23:16,284
You just call us
whenever you want.

345
00:23:16,329 --> 00:23:18,559
And make sure you conference
Aunt Nina in when you do,

346
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:20,531
'cause you know your father,
he's gonna want to talk to her

347
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:23,035
every once in a while. Okay?
  Got it, Mom.

348
00:23:27,075 --> 00:23:30,272
I love you.
  I love you.

349
00:23:30,311 --> 00:23:34,771
Lift off, here I am,
here I go

350
00:23:34,817 --> 00:23:37,809
Stand back,
I'm in control

351
00:23:37,853 --> 00:23:41,482
I'm outta this world,
about to take off

352
00:23:41,524 --> 00:23:45,790
And when I reach the stars,
I still won't stop

353
00:23:45,829 --> 00:23:49,287
'Cause I'm about to rocket....   
  Hey!

354
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:53,463
Now it's five, four,
three, two, one, lift off

355
00:23:56,208 --> 00:23:57,937
Lift off

356
00:23:59,277 --> 00:24:02,542
Lift off...   
  Ow.

357
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:06,716
I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it.
  Thank you.

358
00:24:06,753 --> 00:24:08,744
Sure.

359
00:24:13,327 --> 00:24:15,318
Where did
my jacket go?

360
00:24:17,432 --> 00:24:20,401
Welcome to L.A., baby.
Hop in.

361
00:24:20,435 --> 00:24:21,959
It's gone.

362
00:24:22,004 --> 00:24:24,336
Lift off,
hey you

363
00:24:24,373 --> 00:24:26,534
Get used to my face

364
00:24:26,575 --> 00:24:29,840
I'll be taking
over this place

365
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,939
'Cause the ride has been

366
00:24:31,982 --> 00:24:34,473
A little off track

367
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:37,488
From now on
I'm on the straightest path

368
00:24:37,522 --> 00:24:40,753
Got that look in my eye

369
00:24:40,793 --> 00:24:44,058
Got my head in the sky,
bye bye

370
00:24:44,096 --> 00:24:46,064
I'm outta this world

371
00:24:46,098 --> 00:24:48,066
About to take off

372
00:24:48,101 --> 00:24:51,502
And when I reach the stars,
I still won't stop

373
00:24:55,776 --> 00:24:59,610
'Cause I'm about to rocket
all the way to the top

374
00:24:59,647 --> 00:25:02,616
Now it's five, four,
three, two, one

375
00:25:02,651 --> 00:25:04,881
Lift off.

376
00:25:17,167 --> 00:25:20,432
Oh, come on.

377
00:25:20,471 --> 00:25:21,938
Hello?

378
00:25:21,973 --> 00:25:24,441
Hey! Is anyone there?

379
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:29,043
Oh hh  
you've got to be kidding me.

380
00:25:29,081 --> 00:25:30,708
Hello!

381
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,420
Sorry, full up.

382
00:25:36,456 --> 00:25:38,651
Hey!

383
00:25:43,698 --> 00:25:46,189
Look. Are you going to make
a habit out of this?

384
00:25:46,234 --> 00:25:48,202
Okay. It's late
and I'm tired

385
00:25:48,237 --> 00:25:50,296
and all I want to do
is get up to my dorm. Okay?

386
00:25:50,339 --> 00:25:52,000
What's the password?

387
00:25:56,613 --> 00:25:59,411
Okay. I think we started off
on the wrong foot.

388
00:25:59,449 --> 00:26:01,679
I'm Terri.
  Jay.

389
00:26:08,793 --> 00:26:11,261
It's "monkeys"
by the way.

390
00:26:11,296 --> 00:26:13,287
The password.
  Mm hm.

391
00:26:14,766 --> 00:26:18,395
What room?
  Um...

392
00:26:18,437 --> 00:26:19,802
31 5.

393
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:21,807
Jay.
There you are.

394
00:26:21,842 --> 00:26:25,141
Send you out for a snack
and you bring home a stray. Shame.

395
00:26:25,178 --> 00:26:28,511
Mmm.
Hey. I'm Terri.

396
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:31,610
Uh huh.
  I'll catch you later.

397
00:26:31,653 --> 00:26:33,644
Bye.

398
00:26:33,688 --> 00:26:36,851
You know what?
I think I've got it from here. Thanks.

399
00:26:36,892 --> 00:26:39,019
See ya.
  Whew.

400
00:26:42,699 --> 00:26:45,031
What?
  What was that about? What did I say?

401
00:26:45,068 --> 00:26:48,333
I'm seriously...
  315.

402
00:26:48,371 --> 00:26:50,362
Oh.

403
00:26:52,343 --> 00:26:54,334
Sorry.
I'm so sorry.

404
00:26:57,916 --> 00:27:01,113
Hey. I'm Terri,
your new roommate.

405
00:27:01,153 --> 00:27:05,146
Great. And I thought
I had this place to myself.

406
00:27:05,191 --> 00:27:07,853
Now turn out the damn light!
  Sorry.

407
00:27:37,061 --> 00:27:39,552
Oh my gosh.

408
00:27:44,069 --> 00:27:48,165
Okay. Okay.

409
00:27:59,286 --> 00:28:01,151
Terri?
  Hey. It's me.

410
00:28:01,188 --> 00:28:04,589
Oh, thank God, Terri.
Your dad's called twice already.

411
00:28:04,626 --> 00:28:06,594
Well, the train was late

412
00:28:06,628 --> 00:28:08,789
and my jacket got stolen
and the cab driver was a total jerk.

413
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:10,388
Are you okay?

414
00:28:10,433 --> 00:28:12,367
I'm fine. Let's just conference
Dad in, okay?

415
00:28:12,402 --> 00:28:14,768
Okay.
Here goes nothing.

416
00:28:14,804 --> 00:28:16,772
Okay.

417
00:28:16,807 --> 00:28:18,707
Here we go.

418
00:28:18,742 --> 00:28:20,733
Hey. Are you there?

419
00:28:20,778 --> 00:28:22,370
Yeah.
I'm still here.

420
00:28:22,413 --> 00:28:24,881
Theresa, is that you?
  Hey, yeah, Dad. It's me.

421
00:28:24,916 --> 00:28:26,747
Is Mom there too?
  Yeah, yeah.

422
00:28:26,785 --> 00:28:28,150
She's just
getting on the exchange

423
00:28:28,186 --> 00:28:29,949
Hey, honey!
  What took you so long?

424
00:28:29,989 --> 00:28:32,514
We've been waiting
for you to call for like four hours.

425
00:28:32,558 --> 00:28:34,651
We're sorry, Simon.
Her train was late.

426
00:28:34,694 --> 00:28:36,662
Oh. Well.

427
00:28:36,697 --> 00:28:39,962
What are you two ladies going
to do on your first big night?

428
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,525
We're watching television.
  We're just eating dinner.

429
00:28:42,569 --> 00:28:44,662
What?
  Eating dinner.

430
00:28:44,706 --> 00:28:47,106
We're watching television.
  Which is it?

431
00:28:47,141 --> 00:28:49,939
We're eating dinner
while we're watching television.

432
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,240
Right.

433
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,975
I thought you didn't have
a television, Nina.

434
00:28:53,015 --> 00:28:55,347
I thought that was against
your artistic sensibilities.

435
00:28:55,384 --> 00:28:59,343
Oh, well, I l   I finally
gave in. Sue me.

436
00:28:59,389 --> 00:29:02,222
Uh uh, it's okay as long as you're safe.
Are you safe, honey?

437
00:29:02,258 --> 00:29:04,988
Yeah. I'm fine.
I'm just totally wiped out.

438
00:29:05,029 --> 00:29:06,997
Now you get some rest.
Call us tomorrow.

439
00:29:07,031 --> 00:29:08,794
And Nina?
  Yes?

440
00:29:08,833 --> 00:29:10,596
Don't corrupt my baby.

441
00:29:10,635 --> 00:29:12,296
She's too much
like you already.

442
00:29:12,337 --> 00:29:15,067
Don't worry, Simon.
I'll have her tattooed, with blue hair,

443
00:29:15,107 --> 00:29:17,769
and married to a rapper in no time.
Nighty night.

444
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:20,540
Good night, Nina.
Night, Theresa.

445
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,878
Good night, Mom.
Good night, Dad. I love you.

446
00:29:22,915 --> 00:29:24,906
Bye bye.
I love you.

447
00:29:29,022 --> 00:29:31,923
I think that worked.
I think I did it.

448
00:29:39,468 --> 00:29:41,493
Well, Paul,

449
00:29:41,537 --> 00:29:43,528
I'm here.

450
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:48,336
I hope you're happy.

451
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:13,329
Hi.

452
00:30:14,742 --> 00:30:17,905
I'm Terri, your roommate.
  Yeah. Denise.

453
00:30:17,946 --> 00:30:19,243
Okay, everyone.
Take a seat.

454
00:30:19,281 --> 00:30:21,681
Let's be seated.

455
00:31:26,258 --> 00:31:28,624
In case you bought
that old saw

456
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,525
that those who can't do,
teach.

457
00:31:30,562 --> 00:31:34,089
These talented musicians
beside me are your teachers.

458
00:31:34,133 --> 00:31:37,125
But I'd prefer you
to think of them as your guides.

459
00:31:37,169 --> 00:31:40,400
Hello, and welcome to Bristol Hillman's
summer music program.

460
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,067
I'd like to start
by reminding you

461
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:45,044
of the large number
of talented students who applied

462
00:31:45,078 --> 00:31:46,909
but did not get in.

463
00:31:46,948 --> 00:31:48,245
Now,

464
00:31:48,283 --> 00:31:52,151
this summer is not just about
learning your craft.

465
00:31:52,187 --> 00:31:53,313
It's about

466
00:31:53,355 --> 00:31:55,084
testing your limits.

467
00:31:55,124 --> 00:31:57,922
Experimenting.
New experiences. It's about

468
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,588
building up and rocking
the foundation of that

469
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:03,861
which will give you
your own individual voice.

470
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,595
Now, some basics.

471
00:32:05,636 --> 00:32:08,799
We have a strict 10:00 curfew,
11 :00 on the weekends.

472
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:13,708
Possession of banned substances
will mean immediate dismissal.

473
00:32:13,745 --> 00:32:15,042
Hmm.
This is L.A., people.

474
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:18,447
Use some common sense.
Travel in pairs.

475
00:32:18,483 --> 00:32:21,111
Lastly, the scholarship.

476
00:32:21,154 --> 00:32:23,622
Three weeks from now,
on the last day of the program,

477
00:32:23,656 --> 00:32:25,556
we will have
final performances

478
00:32:25,592 --> 00:32:27,355
where you show us
what you've got.

479
00:32:27,394 --> 00:32:30,227
Now a lucky student will win a $10,000
academic scholarship

480
00:32:30,264 --> 00:32:33,392
for music study.
That's pretty good, huh?

481
00:32:33,435 --> 00:32:36,233
So, work hard.

482
00:32:36,271 --> 00:32:38,762
Have fun.

483
00:32:38,807 --> 00:32:41,139
Get lost.

484
00:32:43,479 --> 00:32:45,379
Later.

485
00:32:45,414 --> 00:32:47,143
Okay.

486
00:32:47,184 --> 00:32:49,812
I gave her three chances.
The chances have come and gone.

487
00:32:49,853 --> 00:32:51,411
Send her back
where she came from.

488
00:32:51,455 --> 00:32:53,480
I don't care!

489
00:32:53,524 --> 00:32:56,789
People, grab a seat.
My name is Mr. Torvald.

490
00:32:56,828 --> 00:32:59,888
You are my class
and we have three weeks

491
00:32:59,932 --> 00:33:02,833
to learn an incredibly
complex choral piece.

492
00:33:02,868 --> 00:33:04,733
It ain't ever gonna happen,

493
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:07,500
but let's give it the ol'
college try, shall we?

494
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:10,134
There are five solos
in the ensemble.

495
00:33:10,176 --> 00:33:13,737
Only five people will perform solos
in front of this class.

496
00:33:13,781 --> 00:33:16,306
And I will hand them out
in two weeks

497
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:19,717
based on participation,
exercises

498
00:33:19,755 --> 00:33:20,983
and je nai sais quoi.

499
00:33:21,023 --> 00:33:23,116
If you're not French,
that means,

500
00:33:23,158 --> 00:33:25,126
"Ooh!"

501
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,287
I will also split you up
into groups of four.

502
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:29,298
Yes, I still count
on my fingers.

503
00:33:29,332 --> 00:33:31,766
One for each part
in the obnoxiously difficult

504
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:34,395
contrapuntal harmony
at the end of the book.

505
00:33:34,438 --> 00:33:36,406
This piece is gonna
drive you nuts.

506
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:39,603
But when you nail it,
it feels good.

507
00:33:39,644 --> 00:33:41,134
You.

508
00:33:41,179 --> 00:33:42,271
You. You.

509
00:33:42,313 --> 00:33:45,305
You. Group one!

510
00:34:03,204 --> 00:34:04,865
Hey, Jay!
Nice hook.

511
00:34:04,906 --> 00:34:06,897
Jump in and pick it up.

512
00:34:16,486 --> 00:34:19,683
Ooh ooh ooh, Ooh ooh ooh,
yeah...

513
00:34:19,722 --> 00:34:24,216
Ooh ooh ooh,
ooh ooh ooh...

514
00:34:24,261 --> 00:34:25,922
Ooh ooh ooh,
ooh ooh ooh

515
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:31,532
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh

516
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,094
Ooh ooh ooh

517
00:34:33,138 --> 00:34:35,572
Ooh ooh ooh, yeah

518
00:34:35,608 --> 00:34:38,975
Ooh ooh ooh...

519
00:34:39,011 --> 00:34:41,002
Hey.
Is anybody sitting here?

520
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:45,241
Ooh ooh ooh...

521
00:34:47,422 --> 00:34:49,549
Yeah...

522
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,824
Yeah, baby...

523
00:34:54,864 --> 00:34:58,527
Hey, baby
ta da da da da...

524
00:34:58,567 --> 00:35:02,526
Ta da da da da dee

525
00:35:02,572 --> 00:35:04,199
Ooh ooh ooh

526
00:35:04,241 --> 00:35:06,300
Ooh ooh ooh, yeah

527
00:35:06,343 --> 00:35:08,334
Ooh ooh ooh

528
00:35:13,251 --> 00:35:15,219
Yeah, ooh ooh ooh

529
00:35:15,254 --> 00:35:17,552
Ooh ooh ooh,
ooh ooh

530
00:35:17,589 --> 00:35:20,558
Ooh hh...

531
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:35,374
How many of you
can identify this note?

532
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,274
You there.
What is the note?

533
00:35:46,422 --> 00:35:49,186
A "B?"
  B flat!

534
00:35:49,226 --> 00:35:53,253
The ability to know any note when
you hear it is great asset.

535
00:35:53,297 --> 00:35:58,200
Those of you who don't have it must work
that much harder.

536
00:35:58,236 --> 00:36:00,500
Is the same with your
ability to read music.

537
00:36:00,538 --> 00:36:02,165
Your opportunities
are expanded.

538
00:36:02,208 --> 00:36:03,869
If you look
at a piece of music,

539
00:36:03,909 --> 00:36:06,275
see how the notes
are arranged on the page

540
00:36:06,312 --> 00:36:08,803
and hear exactly
what it is,

541
00:36:08,848 --> 00:36:10,645
each note in your head.

542
00:36:10,684 --> 00:36:13,278
This is something you will
learn to do this summer

543
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,720
in your individual studies
with me.

544
00:36:24,266 --> 00:36:27,235
I'm so sorry. That was me.
Are you okay?

545
00:36:27,269 --> 00:36:29,635
Yeah, I'm   I'm fine.
I'm sorry. That was my fault.

546
00:36:29,672 --> 00:36:31,902
I was in the way.
  No, it's good. It was my fault.

547
00:36:31,941 --> 00:36:33,932
I should really learn to stand.
  Okay.

548
00:36:39,883 --> 00:36:41,942
Awesome.

549
00:36:51,964 --> 00:36:54,296
She doesn't even know.

550
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,274
Hey. How's it going?
  Couldn't be better.

551
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,988
Should I ask for a single?

552
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:16,185
Am I bothering you that much?
  Hey. Hold up.

553
00:37:16,226 --> 00:37:19,354
I mean, I just get the feeling that
I'm some kinda pain in your butt.

554
00:37:19,396 --> 00:37:21,387
Look, it's not even
like that, all right?

555
00:37:21,431 --> 00:37:23,399
I'm here
for that scholarship.

556
00:37:23,434 --> 00:37:27,097
I'm just about hardcore focus.
  Well it seems really personal.

557
00:37:27,138 --> 00:37:30,198
Oh, please.
I'm not even trying to hear that.

558
00:37:30,242 --> 00:37:32,710
Look, we're all up against
each other for that money.

559
00:37:32,744 --> 00:37:35,577
So I just gotta be able
to do my thing

560
00:37:35,615 --> 00:37:39,210
and not get caught up
in any personalities.

561
00:37:39,252 --> 00:37:42,085
I don't really mean
nothing by it.

562
00:37:42,121 --> 00:37:44,817
So, we cool?

563
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:49,759
Yeah. We're cool.
  Cool.

564
00:37:56,806 --> 00:37:59,900
Hey, Mr. Torvald.
  Hey, Robin.

565
00:37:59,942 --> 00:38:03,469
I wanted to let you know that I tried
those exercises you gave me last summer

566
00:38:03,513 --> 00:38:06,505
and they really helped.
I just wanted to say thank you so much.

567
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:08,780
My pleasure.

568
00:38:08,819 --> 00:38:11,617
Oh, and I'll have you know
that I'm gunning for those solos.

569
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:14,454
Well, I'll keep an eye out for you.
  Thank you, Mr. Torvald.

570
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:19,657
For the Lord God
Omnipotent reigneth

571
00:38:19,698 --> 00:38:21,962
Hallelujah,
hallelujah

572
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,366
Hallelujah, hallelujah

573
00:38:24,404 --> 00:38:29,967
For the Lord God
Omnipotent reigneth

574
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:32,137
Hallelujah,
hallelujah

575
00:38:32,179 --> 00:38:36,240
Hallelujah, Hallelujah.   
  Ouch and cut.

576
00:38:36,284 --> 00:38:38,275
Sorry, that was me.
  Yeah, we know.

577
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,880
And you are?
  Terri Fletcher.

578
00:38:40,922 --> 00:38:43,356
Thought I recognized you.

579
00:38:43,393 --> 00:38:45,452
The girl from the DVD.

580
00:38:45,495 --> 00:38:47,463
Terri Fletcher,
the thing is

581
00:38:47,497 --> 00:38:49,556
the theme emerges
from the harmony.

582
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,194
Give me you hand.
Whack!

583
00:38:52,236 --> 00:38:55,467
None of you follow it directly.
Capice?

584
00:38:55,506 --> 00:38:57,337
Good job, Robin.
Whoo ee!

585
00:38:57,375 --> 00:38:59,343
Okay, let's do it again.

586
00:38:59,377 --> 00:39:01,277
One, two, three, four.

587
00:39:01,312 --> 00:39:06,477
For the Lord God
Omnipotent reigneth

588
00:39:06,519 --> 00:39:09,579
Hallelujah,
hallelujah, hallelujah.

589
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:30,278
Oh.

590
00:39:30,313 --> 00:39:33,009
Sorry, Mr. Wesson.
I was   I forgot my books at the

591
00:39:33,049 --> 00:39:35,017
Is your time
that was wasted.

592
00:39:35,051 --> 00:39:37,019
Please go to the stand.

593
00:39:42,993 --> 00:39:45,223
Please sight read
the first page.

594
00:39:49,968 --> 00:39:52,266
Ca? Ca...

595
00:39:57,778 --> 00:39:58,972
Support.

596
00:39:59,012 --> 00:40:02,277
Support with your diaphragm.

597
00:40:10,826 --> 00:40:13,294
Air goes in.
Diaphragm goes out.

598
00:40:13,329 --> 00:40:16,492
Is okay to look fat.

599
00:40:54,075 --> 00:40:57,340
Sorry.

600
00:41:20,205 --> 00:41:22,196
Hey.
  What's up?

601
00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:33,587
She doesn't,
she doesn't know

602
00:41:33,621 --> 00:41:35,680
She doesn't  
she doesn't, she doesn't

603
00:41:35,723 --> 00:41:37,714
She doesn't even know,
know, know

604
00:41:40,796 --> 00:41:44,357
She   she doesn't
even know, know, know, know

605
00:41:49,372 --> 00:41:51,363
Oh!

606
00:41:55,379 --> 00:41:57,904
Thanks anyways.

607
00:42:40,031 --> 00:42:42,556
You're a serious weirdo.
You know that?

608
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,625
It isn't lucky
unless it's face up.

609
00:42:44,669 --> 00:42:47,229
But now it's just a penny
that thinks it's lucky, but it isn't.

610
00:42:47,272 --> 00:42:49,740
Well now it can be lucky
for someone else.

611
00:42:51,376 --> 00:42:53,844
Besides, haven't you ever heard
of making your own luck?

612
00:42:57,550 --> 00:43:00,542
Well, what do you know?
A lucky penny.

613
00:43:11,332 --> 00:43:13,300
So, an Englishman in L.A.

614
00:43:13,335 --> 00:43:16,998
Yeah, my parents put an ocean between
them after the nastiest divorce ever.

615
00:43:17,039 --> 00:43:18,973
No joke, people study it.

616
00:43:20,944 --> 00:43:23,344
So, how can you have
a sense of humor about that?

617
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:25,348
My music became
like a religion.

618
00:43:25,382 --> 00:43:27,373
It kept me sane.

619
00:43:28,786 --> 00:43:32,244
So, music is your
higher power.

620
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:34,781
Pretty much.
I mean, look at this.

621
00:43:34,827 --> 00:43:36,818
This city.
All these people.

622
00:43:36,862 --> 00:43:39,831
All this life
and music.

623
00:43:39,866 --> 00:43:42,096
I'm gonna make music
for them.

624
00:43:42,135 --> 00:43:44,695
I can't think
of a better way to spend my life.

625
00:43:49,076 --> 00:43:51,044
Are you missing home?

626
00:43:51,078 --> 00:43:53,342
A little bit.

627
00:43:53,381 --> 00:43:56,179
I don't know. It's just been really
tough lately.

628
00:43:56,218 --> 00:43:58,186
Come on.

629
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:00,882
I just gave you my
"E! True Hollywood Story."

630
00:44:00,923 --> 00:44:03,221
You gotta
give me something.

631
00:44:03,259 --> 00:44:05,284
Um.

632
00:44:05,328 --> 00:44:07,296
Me and my brother
were in a car accident

633
00:44:07,331 --> 00:44:10,960
on the day of his graduation.
And, um,

634
00:44:11,001 --> 00:44:13,401
some drunk driver ran
through a red light and

635
00:44:13,438 --> 00:44:15,736
Hey, Terri!
Come here.

636
00:44:15,774 --> 00:44:17,799
Uh, look, Terri,
I've gotta go.

637
00:44:17,842 --> 00:44:19,810
I've gotta meet
somebody.

638
00:44:19,845 --> 00:44:21,836
Look, say hi
to Denise for me.

639
00:44:24,984 --> 00:44:28,385
Hey.
  Hey, was that Jay running off?

640
00:44:28,421 --> 00:44:30,753
Yeah.
  Figures. What, was he macking on you?

641
00:44:30,791 --> 00:44:32,759
Not that I could tell.

642
00:44:32,793 --> 00:44:35,159
Well, count your blessings,
'cause I know his game.

643
00:44:35,196 --> 00:44:36,925
He likes to hit
on nice girls.

644
00:44:36,964 --> 00:44:39,330
And baby, you  
you got a lock on that one.

645
00:44:39,367 --> 00:44:41,335
What?
  I mean, look at you.

646
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:44,066
Look at your hair, your clothes,
the way you talk.

647
00:44:44,106 --> 00:44:46,506
You're like some kinda
retro Brady Buncher.

648
00:44:46,542 --> 00:44:48,976
Shoot, I'm not even
trying to hear that.

649
00:44:51,014 --> 00:44:53,005
Okay, that was cute.
My bad.

650
00:44:56,187 --> 00:44:58,212
I didn't know
you could do this.

651
00:44:58,255 --> 00:45:01,156
Yeah. My teachers are always harping
about how it's bad for me.

652
00:45:01,193 --> 00:45:04,594
You know, how I'm gonna lose my ear.
But I just like how it sounds in here.

653
00:45:35,866 --> 00:45:38,300
Hello.
  Oh hi, honey.

654
00:45:38,335 --> 00:45:40,303
Um, Dad wants
to talk to you.

655
00:45:40,337 --> 00:45:43,864
Um, Simon, pick up.

656
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:46,206
Hey, sweetheart.

657
00:45:46,244 --> 00:45:48,212
How's it going?
Hanging in there?

658
00:45:48,247 --> 00:45:50,977
Yeah, everything's good.
  Sure do miss you.

659
00:45:51,016 --> 00:45:53,041
I miss you too, Dad.

660
00:45:55,655 --> 00:45:59,318
What was that? Sounded like a siren.
  Uh, no, no. It's nothing.

661
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:01,919
Well, it didn't sound like nothing.
It sounded pretty close.

662
00:46:03,831 --> 00:46:06,629
The neighbors are out of town
and their alarm keeps going off

663
00:46:06,667 --> 00:46:08,635
so, I'm gonna go talk
to the police, okay?

664
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:11,298
I'll call you back. All right, bye.
  Okay, bye, honey.

665
00:46:11,339 --> 00:46:13,534
Uh, what, Terri, wait.

666
00:46:13,575 --> 00:46:15,634
Terri?

667
00:46:15,678 --> 00:46:18,806
I'm gonna lose it.

668
00:46:19,115 --> 00:46:20,639
King of Kings

669
00:46:20,683 --> 00:46:22,810
Forever and ever

670
00:46:22,853 --> 00:46:24,821
Hallelujah, hallelujah

671
00:46:24,855 --> 00:46:26,823
And Lord of Lords

672
00:46:26,857 --> 00:46:28,825
Forever and ever

673
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:30,828
Hallelujah, hallelujah   
  Yes.

674
00:46:30,862 --> 00:46:32,489
King of Kings

675
00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:34,498
Forever and ever

676
00:46:34,533 --> 00:46:36,501
Hallelujah, hallelujah

677
00:46:36,535 --> 00:46:38,526
And Lord of Lords...

678
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:41,937
I can never get that note.
I can't believe this.

679
00:46:41,975 --> 00:46:46,378
I can.
  Problem, ladies?

680
00:46:46,413 --> 00:46:49,541
Yeah, I think that some of us maybe need
to practice this

681
00:46:49,583 --> 00:46:52,518
a little bit more outside of class.
  Meow!

682
00:46:52,553 --> 00:46:54,350
Why don't you let me
worry about that, hmm?

683
00:46:54,388 --> 00:46:56,618
Okay, that's it.
Done for the day.

684
00:46:56,658 --> 00:46:59,593
Go on.
Get outta here.

685
00:46:59,628 --> 00:47:01,926
Ms. Fletcher.

686
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,298
Okay, I give up.

687
00:47:06,336 --> 00:47:08,804
What did you do
with the girl on the DVD?

688
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:10,602
Excuse me?

689
00:47:10,641 --> 00:47:13,701
The lively, funny, talented girl,
what did you do with her?

690
00:47:13,744 --> 00:47:16,804
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

691
00:47:16,848 --> 00:47:18,748
I sent my songs on a CD.

692
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:22,116
No, there was also a DVD.

693
00:47:22,154 --> 00:47:24,486
It came in late.
We almost didn't see it.

694
00:47:24,523 --> 00:47:26,821
But it's a big part
of the reason why you are here.

695
00:47:26,859 --> 00:47:28,827
Sit down.
Be comfortable.

696
00:47:28,862 --> 00:47:30,887
Okay, Mr. Torvald.
I did not send it.

697
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:32,592
I really have no idea
what you're talking about.

698
00:47:32,632 --> 00:47:34,224
No? Well.

699
00:47:34,267 --> 00:47:37,828
Let me introduce you
to one interesting, fascinating lady.

700
00:47:37,872 --> 00:47:39,840
Maybe you'll be inspired.

701
00:47:39,874 --> 00:47:41,865
I know we were.

702
00:47:47,316 --> 00:47:51,252
Terri's my sister. And, uh, she's my
favorite person in the whole world.

703
00:47:51,287 --> 00:47:54,415
She like a challenge.
She thrives when she's pushed.

704
00:47:54,457 --> 00:47:56,448
And the people
who can do that,

705
00:47:56,494 --> 00:47:58,519
they don't live
in Flagstaff.

706
00:47:58,562 --> 00:48:00,757
Terri deserves a chance
to learn from the best.

707
00:48:00,798 --> 00:48:03,289
She's already good.

708
00:48:03,335 --> 00:48:05,303
But she could be great.

709
00:48:24,059 --> 00:48:26,550
If you let her in,
you won't be disappointed.

710
00:48:36,506 --> 00:48:39,202
Hey, Terri?

711
00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:42,201
Terri!

712
00:48:47,552 --> 00:48:50,350
Terri.
Are you okay?

713
00:48:50,389 --> 00:48:52,857
Please. It's probably just some
weirdo misfit thing.

714
00:49:12,481 --> 00:49:14,176
No.

715
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:27,127
The show's over.
Okay, you can go now.

716
00:49:27,164 --> 00:49:30,531
Look, whatever it is,
you can't leave.

717
00:49:32,303 --> 00:49:37,138
It's copping out.
  What are you doing here?

718
00:49:37,176 --> 00:49:39,337
Same as everybody else.

719
00:49:39,378 --> 00:49:42,245
The music thing.
Ducking a summer job.

720
00:49:42,281 --> 00:49:44,977
I mean here in my doorway.

721
00:49:45,018 --> 00:49:47,248
Look, come on.
Let's just get outta here.

722
00:49:48,989 --> 00:49:50,923
Come on.
Let's just go.

723
00:49:50,958 --> 00:49:53,085
The bag isn't walking away.

724
00:49:54,128 --> 00:49:55,891
How do I know you won't?

725
00:50:04,206 --> 00:50:06,367
I was sitting
right next to him.

726
00:50:06,408 --> 00:50:09,002
And he died and I didn't.
You know?

727
00:50:09,044 --> 00:50:12,480
And I don't know why.

728
00:50:12,515 --> 00:50:15,814
But I miss him.

729
00:50:15,852 --> 00:50:19,379
The second I start to feel
like I'm enjoying myself,

730
00:50:19,423 --> 00:50:21,391
this voice comes
inside my head and...

731
00:50:21,425 --> 00:50:23,256
it's like,

732
00:50:23,294 --> 00:50:27,390
"How can you be having
a good time when Paul is dead?"

733
00:50:27,432 --> 00:50:30,560
You can't blame
yourself like that.

734
00:50:30,603 --> 00:50:32,662
You don't understand.

735
00:50:32,705 --> 00:50:34,673
It was my fault.

736
00:50:34,707 --> 00:50:37,699
I got him to sneak out.

737
00:50:37,745 --> 00:50:41,704
I shouldn't
have risked it.

738
00:50:41,749 --> 00:50:44,513
Look, Terri.
Some idiot ran a red light.

739
00:50:44,552 --> 00:50:47,077
It was bad luck.

740
00:50:47,122 --> 00:50:50,956
Messed up timing.
That's all.

741
00:50:50,993 --> 00:50:53,655
You weren't there.

742
00:50:56,265 --> 00:51:00,929
Look, I can't imagine
what you're going through.

743
00:51:00,971 --> 00:51:02,939
But I do know
from experience

744
00:51:02,973 --> 00:51:06,374
backing down can
become a way of life.

745
00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:08,378
Don't leave.

746
00:51:08,412 --> 00:51:11,347
Screw the pressure.
Screw the scholarship.

747
00:51:11,383 --> 00:51:13,874
I mean, do your own thing
on your own terms.

748
00:51:13,919 --> 00:51:15,887
And get what
you came here for.

749
00:51:15,921 --> 00:51:18,549
That's what counts.
  But Jay, I'm lying to people.

750
00:51:18,591 --> 00:51:20,559
I mean, I had to lie
to get here.

751
00:51:20,593 --> 00:51:23,061
So what.
You got here.

752
00:51:23,096 --> 00:51:25,894
It's not
suppose to be easy.

753
00:51:25,933 --> 00:51:30,233
You're here because you did
what you had to do.

754
00:51:30,271 --> 00:51:33,399
Why do you care
so much?

755
00:51:33,441 --> 00:51:35,432
I don't know.

756
00:51:41,450 --> 00:51:44,578
I like you.

757
00:51:44,621 --> 00:51:49,422
And Robin fits
into that, how?

758
00:51:49,459 --> 00:51:51,586
We met here
last year and...

759
00:51:51,629 --> 00:51:54,097
we had a thing
for a while.

760
00:51:54,132 --> 00:51:56,600
That's all over.

761
00:51:56,634 --> 00:51:59,102
Does she know that?

762
00:51:59,138 --> 00:52:01,106
Yeah, well...

763
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:03,108
some people hang on

764
00:52:03,142 --> 00:52:05,133
when they should
just let go.

765
00:52:17,925 --> 00:52:20,393
La la la la 
la la la la

766
00:52:20,429 --> 00:52:22,522
La la la la

767
00:52:22,564 --> 00:52:24,862
La la la la

768
00:52:25,969 --> 00:52:27,960
La la.

769
00:52:28,972 --> 00:52:30,439
Thank you.

770
00:52:30,473 --> 00:52:32,839
Okay, I'm not doing this
to torture you people.

771
00:52:32,877 --> 00:52:34,845
Just think of this
as a midterm worth,

772
00:52:34,879 --> 00:52:37,347
oh, half your grade.
Ms. Fletcher?

773
00:52:37,381 --> 00:52:39,372
Please?

774
00:52:41,953 --> 00:52:45,787
La la la la la

775
00:52:45,825 --> 00:52:49,921
La la 
la la la

776
00:52:49,962 --> 00:52:53,227
La la la la la...

777
00:52:53,267 --> 00:52:55,861
La la la la la la

778
00:52:55,903 --> 00:52:58,997
Ha ho

779
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:01,600
O o o o

780
00:53:01,643 --> 00:53:03,634
O a a a a a

781
00:53:03,678 --> 00:53:06,772
O o o o o o

782
00:53:06,815 --> 00:53:09,841
Hey a a a
yeah e a

783
00:53:14,257 --> 00:53:16,225
Yeah!
That was great.

784
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:20,622
All right, you take the top
of the fourth.

785
00:53:20,665 --> 00:53:23,156
Awesome.
  I was talking to Terri. Bing!

786
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,964
Okay, let's take
the third part from the top.

787
00:53:26,004 --> 00:53:28,029
Is everybody ready?

788
00:53:28,073 --> 00:53:30,234
One, two, three, four

789
00:53:30,275 --> 00:53:34,075
Hallelujah,
hallelujah

790
00:53:34,113 --> 00:53:36,013
Hallelujah, hallelujah

791
00:53:36,049 --> 00:53:37,676
Hallelujah.

792
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:41,611
Hey.

793
00:53:43,290 --> 00:53:45,258
What's this?

794
00:53:45,292 --> 00:53:47,590
I think maybe Giordanni
is not for you.

795
00:53:47,629 --> 00:53:51,224
We try something
else, hmm?

796
00:53:51,266 --> 00:53:53,962
You know, I appreciate
the thought, Mr. Wesson,

797
00:53:54,003 --> 00:53:57,439
but, you know, I'd really like to stick
to the old one.

798
00:53:57,473 --> 00:54:00,465
I'm feeling much better today
and I wanna see if I can keep it up.

799
00:54:07,819 --> 00:54:09,719
Thanks.

800
00:54:35,984 --> 00:54:37,975
Hmm.

801
00:54:46,330 --> 00:54:49,424
You and me

802
00:54:49,466 --> 00:54:53,766
Can't you see

803
00:54:53,805 --> 00:54:57,798
How our hearts are one?

804
00:55:04,917 --> 00:55:06,145
Wha

805
00:55:06,185 --> 00:55:08,380
What are you doing here?
  Oh, uh...

806
00:55:08,422 --> 00:55:10,390
just...

807
00:55:10,424 --> 00:55:12,585
the door was open.
I just heard you playing.

808
00:55:15,029 --> 00:55:16,997
Oh, don't stop.

809
00:55:17,031 --> 00:55:18,999
No, it's, um,
it's okay.

810
00:55:19,033 --> 00:55:20,864
I was, um,
I was finished anyway.

811
00:55:20,903 --> 00:55:23,531
Whatever.

812
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:26,508
Terri, wait.

813
00:55:26,542 --> 00:55:29,773
I'm sorry, I'm just...

814
00:55:29,813 --> 00:55:32,213
a bit weird
when I'm writing.

815
00:55:32,248 --> 00:55:35,012
Why?
  Well...

816
00:55:35,052 --> 00:55:37,520
I it's just my lyrics.
They're really lame.

817
00:55:37,555 --> 00:55:39,523
I mean, when I sing them.

818
00:55:39,557 --> 00:55:41,684
And I want them to mean
so much more, but

819
00:55:41,726 --> 00:55:43,717
Well, I've been writing songs
since I was a kid.

820
00:55:43,762 --> 00:55:45,753
But my arrangements
sound like

821
00:55:45,797 --> 00:55:49,631
some cheesy Saturday morning
cartoon or something.

822
00:55:49,669 --> 00:55:53,435
Play something for me.
  Oh, um.

823
00:55:53,473 --> 00:55:56,340
It's not ready yet.
  Come on, whatever happened to that...

824
00:55:56,376 --> 00:55:59,539
"You've got to do your own thing
on your own terms"

825
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:01,309
junk that you gave
me the other day?

826
00:56:01,349 --> 00:56:03,180
Come on.

827
00:56:03,218 --> 00:56:05,209
Okay.

828
00:56:07,256 --> 00:56:10,885
You and me
can't you see

829
00:56:10,926 --> 00:56:13,861
How our hearts
are one?

830
00:56:13,897 --> 00:56:15,990
Please believe

831
00:56:16,032 --> 00:56:19,399
And don't deceive

832
00:56:19,436 --> 00:56:23,463
Now our journey's
just begun

833
00:56:23,508 --> 00:56:26,306
The sunlight
in your hair

834
00:56:26,344 --> 00:56:29,575
Makes my heart jump
in the air...

835
00:56:31,617 --> 00:56:33,778
Come on.
  Okay, wait.

836
00:56:35,155 --> 00:56:37,180
I like the music a lot.

837
00:56:37,223 --> 00:56:39,282
Yeah?
  Okay? But what about this?

838
00:56:41,061 --> 00:56:42,790
Yeah, I like that.
  Okay?

839
00:56:42,830 --> 00:56:44,855
It's very cool.

840
00:56:45,132 --> 00:56:47,794
When it comes to rap,
you don't even write your stuff

841
00:56:47,836 --> 00:56:50,100
Yeah you make tracks
but I make twice as much.

842
00:56:50,138 --> 00:56:53,596
Oh, spring, when a young
man's fancy turns to love.

843
00:56:53,642 --> 00:56:56,270
Did you guys see that?
  What?

844
00:56:56,312 --> 00:56:58,837
Oh, it's weird 'cause
there's a hole in my chest

845
00:56:58,881 --> 00:57:01,042
where my heart used to be
'cause someone else

846
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:05,544
yanked it out and she doesn't even
friggin' care that she did it.

847
00:57:05,589 --> 00:57:08,114
Are you talking about the girl in
the black sweatshirt?

848
00:57:08,159 --> 00:57:10,320
Dude, she's the hottest
player here.

849
00:57:10,361 --> 00:57:12,625
I heard her in the practice
rooms and she's flawless.

850
00:57:12,664 --> 00:57:16,259
Well, she looked at me
and I just...

851
00:57:17,970 --> 00:57:20,768
oh, man, snap.

852
00:57:20,806 --> 00:57:23,240
Friend, you're hooked.
  Hopelessly.

853
00:57:23,276 --> 00:57:26,677
Have you ever even talked to her?
  No, I'm working on that.

854
00:57:26,713 --> 00:57:28,704
See, the problem is she won't give
me the time of day.

855
00:57:28,749 --> 00:57:31,912
Well, why don't l
introduce you guys?

856
00:57:31,953 --> 00:57:34,183
What if I told you
you were the coolest girl ever?

857
00:57:34,222 --> 00:57:36,417
Jay, I like this girl.
You know how to pick them.

858
00:57:36,458 --> 00:57:40,019
I've always said that, haven't l, Jay?
  Yeah, he has always said that.

859
00:57:40,062 --> 00:57:41,825
Kiwi seal of approval.

860
00:57:53,644 --> 00:57:57,080
Hi.

861
00:57:57,115 --> 00:57:59,276
Hey, I'm Terri.

862
00:57:59,317 --> 00:58:00,807
Sorry to bother you.

863
00:58:02,154 --> 00:58:04,486
Your name?

864
00:58:04,523 --> 00:58:06,855
Sloane.

865
00:58:06,892 --> 00:58:11,386
I   I know we don't have
any classes together or anything, but...

866
00:58:11,431 --> 00:58:13,661
um, I just thought
that I'd introduce myself.

867
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:16,225
Okay.

868
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,408
Okay, so there's
this guy, right?

869
00:58:21,442 --> 00:58:24,900
And, um, he's really nice
and his name's Kiwi

870
00:58:24,947 --> 00:58:27,814
and he kinda has a crush on you.
So we were wondering

871
00:58:27,850 --> 00:58:30,512
if you wanted to come
hang out with us on Saturday night?

872
00:58:30,553 --> 00:58:33,750
Kiwi's a weird name.

873
00:58:33,790 --> 00:58:37,419
Why would he have a crush on me?
That's stupid.

874
00:58:39,230 --> 00:58:42,461
Um, I mean, sometimes there's just
nothing you can do about it.

875
00:58:44,102 --> 00:58:46,502
Well, anyway, um, we're gonna meet
in the lobby at 7::00

876
00:58:46,538 --> 00:58:49,905
and, um, we're gonna grab
a bite to eat, okay?

877
00:58:53,479 --> 00:58:55,447
I guess.

878
00:58:55,482 --> 00:58:57,245
Great.

879
00:59:03,925 --> 00:59:06,393
Okay.

880
00:59:06,428 --> 00:59:08,658
Really good.

881
00:59:14,403 --> 00:59:17,395
It's kinda weird talking.
Okay, you think and throw it at.

882
00:59:17,441 --> 00:59:19,409
But then, yeah.
  You're in.

883
00:59:19,443 --> 00:59:22,901
You beautiful
little petunia.

884
00:59:22,947 --> 00:59:26,314
You   ah! Ah, sacre bleu! Ah!
  I got you, man.

885
00:59:26,351 --> 00:59:28,410
Okay, girl.
So talk to me

886
00:59:28,453 --> 00:59:30,421
Now it's you and Jay?

887
00:59:30,456 --> 00:59:32,424
Yeah, kind of.

888
00:59:32,458 --> 00:59:34,426
I mean,
he's really cool.

889
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:36,428
And what about Robin,
Ms. Thing?

890
00:59:36,463 --> 00:59:39,159
He says they're over.
  Yeah, right.

891
00:59:39,199 --> 00:59:41,167
That's really cute.
  Oh, you like this?

892
00:59:41,201 --> 00:59:42,225
Yeah.

893
00:59:42,268 --> 00:59:43,929
My mom, she runs this funky
little clothing shop.

894
00:59:43,971 --> 00:59:47,134
She's got great taste.
  Really?

895
00:59:47,174 --> 00:59:49,165
Yeah, I just wish business
was better though, you know?

896
00:59:49,210 --> 00:59:52,577
I mean, even with me working part-time
bagging groceries, and you know,

897
00:59:52,614 --> 00:59:54,582
doing what I can
street performing,

898
00:59:54,616 --> 00:59:57,084
we still had crazy trouble
scrapping up the tuition.

899
00:59:57,120 --> 01:00:00,453
I mean, why do you think I'm stressing
that scholarship?

900
01:00:00,490 --> 01:00:02,458
Hey, come here
for a second.

901
01:00:02,492 --> 01:00:04,460
I want you to see
what this looks like.

902
01:00:04,495 --> 01:00:06,986
Really?
  Yeah, come on.

903
01:00:07,030 --> 01:00:08,998
You forced me.

904
01:00:09,032 --> 01:00:12,661
Oh yeah, that's fresh.
  Oh, do I look like I'm going clubbing?

905
01:00:24,885 --> 01:00:26,750
Oh my God.

906
01:00:32,026 --> 01:00:33,891
Hey, Aunt Nina.
  Terri, thank God I reached you!

907
01:00:33,928 --> 01:00:35,896
Your dad called,
I did my thing.

908
01:00:35,930 --> 01:00:39,491
I think he smells a rat.
I don't know how, I don't know why.

909
01:00:39,535 --> 01:00:42,436
But your mother just called
and said he is on his way here, now!

910
01:00:42,471 --> 01:00:45,497
I'll stall him as best I can but is
there any way you can just get here?

911
01:00:45,542 --> 01:00:48,033
Oh my God.
We're dead.

912
01:00:49,078 --> 01:00:51,069
I'm dead.

913
01:00:52,783 --> 01:00:53,772
Hey, Jay!

914
01:01:06,999 --> 01:01:08,967
Okay, thanks.
  Good luck, Terri.

915
01:01:09,001 --> 01:01:11,526
I'll see you
tomorrow night, all right?

916
01:01:11,572 --> 01:01:14,564
The desert train is now
boarding on platform 12.

917
01:01:27,122 --> 01:01:31,081
We're getting a little break
from the 100 plus temperatures

918
01:01:31,127 --> 01:01:33,322
here in the greater
Palm Springs area.

919
01:01:33,363 --> 01:01:36,127
Wind's out of the northeast
at six miles per hour.

920
01:02:14,677 --> 01:02:17,145
Hey.
  Hey, Nina.

921
01:02:17,179 --> 01:02:19,147
Where is she?

922
01:02:19,182 --> 01:02:20,979
Ah, well, um...

923
01:02:21,018 --> 01:02:23,748
there's something
I wanted to talk to you about, Simon.

924
01:02:23,787 --> 01:02:26,483
Oh yeah.
  Yeah, um

925
01:02:26,524 --> 01:02:28,515
Daddy!

926
01:02:31,697 --> 01:02:35,030
I missed you.
  Oh, I missed you too.

927
01:02:39,372 --> 01:02:42,000
I need a drink.

928
01:02:46,047 --> 01:02:48,777
Sorry.

929
01:02:48,816 --> 01:02:51,683
They're not coming, man.
I'm telling you.

930
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:53,483
They're not showing up.
  No way. Look,

931
01:02:53,522 --> 01:02:55,251
women are always
fashionably late.

932
01:02:55,290 --> 01:02:59,693
They'll be here.
  Okay, they'll be here.

933
01:02:59,729 --> 01:03:01,697
Dude.
  Thanks, man.

934
01:03:01,731 --> 01:03:03,722
No, no, no, dude.

935
01:03:06,503 --> 01:03:07,834
Damn it.

936
01:03:07,871 --> 01:03:10,533
No, no, wait, wait, wait!
Don't walk away.

937
01:03:10,574 --> 01:03:13,771
Hey, you guys,
I'm sorry I'm late.

938
01:03:14,846 --> 01:03:17,474
Hey, Sloane,
you look great.

939
01:03:17,515 --> 01:03:19,176
Yeah.

940
01:03:19,218 --> 01:03:20,549
Come on, let's go.

941
01:03:22,021 --> 01:03:24,251
Um, I think
you should   cool.

942
01:03:24,290 --> 01:03:27,350
No, seriously. I had to pretend to my
dad like I had been there

943
01:03:27,394 --> 01:03:30,124
the whole entire time, and meanwhile
my aunt was remodeling her house,

944
01:03:30,163 --> 01:03:33,132
so when I went to go find the bathroom,
I walked into a closet.

945
01:03:33,167 --> 01:03:35,067
No way.
  Yes way.

946
01:03:35,103 --> 01:03:37,936
Yeah, you know, we all
thought you were like some

947
01:03:37,972 --> 01:03:40,532
goody-two shoes,
but you're like a fugitive from the law.

948
01:03:42,144 --> 01:03:44,408
Speaking of which, fugitive,
where are you leading us to?

949
01:03:44,446 --> 01:03:46,141
You'll see.

950
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:04,233
She's good.
  Beyond, man.

951
01:04:06,172 --> 01:04:08,606
This one, okay?

952
01:04:16,016 --> 01:04:19,816
You got a smile
so bright

953
01:04:19,854 --> 01:04:23,221
You know you could
have been a candle

954
01:04:23,258 --> 01:04:26,091
I'm holding
you so tight...

955
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:29,998
Come on you guys.
Come on.

956
01:04:30,032 --> 01:04:32,000
She's not serious.
  Come on.

957
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:34,901
No, no, no.
     The way you swept me off my feet

958
01:04:34,938 --> 01:04:38,601
You know you could
have been some perfume

959
01:04:38,642 --> 01:04:43,875
Well you could have been
anything that you wanted to

960
01:04:43,915 --> 01:04:46,577
And I could tell

961
01:04:46,618 --> 01:04:48,586
The way you do
the things you do

962
01:04:48,620 --> 01:04:50,588
The way you do
the things you do

963
01:04:50,622 --> 01:04:52,146
The way you do the things
you do

964
01:04:52,191 --> 01:04:54,591
The way you do
the things you do

965
01:04:54,627 --> 01:04:58,119
And as pretty as you are

966
01:04:58,164 --> 01:05:00,928
You know you could
have been a flower...

967
01:05:46,052 --> 01:05:48,577
I like to come up here
sometimes to think.

968
01:05:48,623 --> 01:05:52,684
This is really cool.

969
01:05:52,727 --> 01:05:54,718
I love it up here.

970
01:05:54,763 --> 01:05:56,754
Wish I had a place
to think like this.

971
01:05:56,799 --> 01:05:58,926
Well, you play
your cards right,

972
01:05:58,967 --> 01:06:01,026
maybe I'll share
with you.

973
01:06:01,070 --> 01:06:03,038
Maybe?
  Maybe.

974
01:06:03,072 --> 01:06:06,667
Depends on what you
come up here to think about.

975
01:06:06,710 --> 01:06:08,701
Stuff.

976
01:06:11,515 --> 01:06:13,483
My dreams.

977
01:06:13,518 --> 01:06:16,248
Music.
The future.

978
01:06:16,288 --> 01:06:18,620
If I have one.

979
01:06:26,867 --> 01:06:28,858
Come on.

980
01:06:46,222 --> 01:06:48,190
Too fast?

981
01:06:48,225 --> 01:06:50,193
Not ready.

982
01:06:50,227 --> 01:06:53,560
Well... cool.

983
01:06:53,597 --> 01:06:55,792
I mean I like you.

984
01:06:55,833 --> 01:06:57,596
A lot.

985
01:06:57,635 --> 01:07:00,069
Yeah, I like you too.

986
01:07:05,177 --> 01:07:07,975
I was thinking of that song
we were working on the other day.

987
01:07:08,014 --> 01:07:09,481
Um hmm.

988
01:07:09,515 --> 01:07:12,814
I think we should do it for our final
performance piece.

989
01:07:12,852 --> 01:07:14,251
You sing.
I'll play.

990
01:07:14,288 --> 01:07:16,415
We could split
the scholarship

991
01:07:16,457 --> 01:07:19,688
and we could write something
really meaningful.

992
01:07:21,529 --> 01:07:23,588
Okay?
  Deal.

993
01:07:26,868 --> 01:07:30,326
Do you want
to try that again?

994
01:07:30,373 --> 01:07:32,364
What?

995
01:07:59,572 --> 01:08:02,302
Something in the way
you throw your hair

996
01:08:02,343 --> 01:08:04,641
Back over your shoulder

997
01:08:04,679 --> 01:08:07,477
Something in the way
you smile

998
01:08:07,515 --> 01:08:09,483
When you're looking
my way

999
01:08:09,518 --> 01:08:11,486
I've got no concerns

1000
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:14,512
The days are long
and the nights get colder

1001
01:08:14,556 --> 01:08:17,992
Because it's this
I've got to try

1002
01:08:18,027 --> 01:08:19,654
On you, honey

1003
01:08:19,696 --> 01:08:22,324
I ain't never wishin'
for the change

1004
01:08:22,366 --> 01:08:24,197
In my condition

1005
01:08:24,234 --> 01:08:25,963
I'm not rich
but I know

1006
01:08:26,003 --> 01:08:28,995
That the sun
will shine for me

1007
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:30,701
Ride with me

1008
01:08:30,742 --> 01:08:35,111
Won't you take
a ride with me?

1009
01:08:37,516 --> 01:08:40,110
Let's go, let's go!
  Hey, it's open mic night, guys.

1010
01:08:44,958 --> 01:08:46,949
Boo!
  You suck!

1011
01:08:49,897 --> 01:08:51,865
Tough crowd.

1012
01:08:51,899 --> 01:08:53,867
Yeah.
  Tell me about it.

1013
01:08:53,901 --> 01:08:56,267
I'm gonna go see if we can get onto
the list to perform.

1014
01:08:56,305 --> 01:08:58,273
What?
Jay, no.

1015
01:08:58,307 --> 01:09:00,673
Hey look, we can
practice forever, but sooner or later

1016
01:09:00,709 --> 01:09:02,677
we're gonna
have to do it.

1017
01:09:02,712 --> 01:09:05,112
We gotta get out of here.

1018
01:09:05,148 --> 01:09:08,743
Hey ey.

1019
01:09:08,786 --> 01:09:10,754
All right,
all right.

1020
01:09:10,788 --> 01:09:12,756
Stanley Wilson,
ladies and gentlemen.

1021
01:09:12,790 --> 01:09:14,758
Let's give a big hand
to Stanley Wilson.

1022
01:09:14,792 --> 01:09:16,760
Why are you here?!
  You suck, man!

1023
01:09:16,795 --> 01:09:18,763
Good job.

1024
01:09:18,797 --> 01:09:20,958
I'm so nervous.
  Well, look, just

1025
01:09:20,999 --> 01:09:23,331
picture the audience naked.

1026
01:09:23,369 --> 01:09:25,496
Okay, bad idea.

1027
01:09:25,538 --> 01:09:28,302
All right, next up,
we have Terri and Jay.

1028
01:09:28,341 --> 01:09:30,775
Now, it is their first time
here at the Blue Moon,

1029
01:09:30,811 --> 01:09:33,609
so let's give them a warm welcome.
Terri and Jay, everyone.

1030
01:09:47,229 --> 01:09:50,687
There's a light in me

1031
01:09:50,734 --> 01:09:52,702
And

1032
01:09:52,736 --> 01:09:55,261
Let me start over.
  Come on, sing something!

1033
01:09:55,305 --> 01:09:58,365
There's a light in me

1034
01:09:58,409 --> 01:10:01,310
Hey, turn around.
     And it's shine

1035
01:10:02,881 --> 01:10:04,815
Look, it's okay.
Turn around.

1036
01:10:06,885 --> 01:10:08,876
Sorry.

1037
01:10:12,058 --> 01:10:15,516
There's a light in me

1038
01:10:15,562 --> 01:10:19,828
And it's shine  
shine

1039
01:10:19,867 --> 01:10:22,233
I can't help

1040
01:10:30,046 --> 01:10:33,106
Paul!

1041
01:10:38,789 --> 01:10:40,757
Terri! Terri!

1042
01:10:40,791 --> 01:10:42,759
Terri, wait, wait!

1043
01:10:42,793 --> 01:10:45,921
Are you okay?
  I'm fine.

1044
01:10:45,964 --> 01:10:49,263
I saw  
I just wasn't ready.

1045
01:10:51,770 --> 01:10:54,330
I   I was gonna wait.

1046
01:10:54,373 --> 01:10:55,397
But, um,

1047
01:10:55,441 --> 01:10:58,535
this is for you.

1048
01:10:58,578 --> 01:11:00,569
Paul's cross.

1049
01:11:35,020 --> 01:11:39,923
The kingdom
of this world

1050
01:11:39,959 --> 01:11:42,928
He is become

1051
01:11:42,962 --> 01:11:46,090
The kingdom of our Lord

1052
01:11:46,133 --> 01:11:48,101
And of His Christ...

1053
01:11:48,135 --> 01:11:51,935
And of His Christ.

1054
01:11:51,973 --> 01:11:54,806
Good. Nice.

1055
01:11:54,842 --> 01:11:57,276
Improving.
We've got 10 minutes left.

1056
01:11:57,313 --> 01:11:59,577
I want to run the third section.
Has anybody seen Terri?

1057
01:11:59,615 --> 01:12:02,607
I can sing the part, Mr. Torvald, I know
it backwards and forwards.

1058
01:12:02,651 --> 01:12:05,586
It's Terri's solo,
so lets wait for her.

1059
01:12:05,622 --> 01:12:08,614
But she's not even here. And it's not
like she can sing it anyway.

1060
01:12:08,658 --> 01:12:11,422
Terri's worked hard for it.
She deserves it.

1061
01:12:11,462 --> 01:12:14,920
No, I deserve this part!

1062
01:12:14,966 --> 01:12:16,558
Stop it. Jeez.

1063
01:12:18,470 --> 01:12:20,461
Ha ha.

1064
01:12:21,540 --> 01:12:24,236
Well I guess you have
a new favorite now!

1065
01:12:27,614 --> 01:12:30,242
Hey.

1066
01:12:30,283 --> 01:12:32,251
Come on.

1067
01:12:32,286 --> 01:12:34,277
Whoa, whoa.
What's wrong?

1068
01:12:38,627 --> 01:12:40,857
I don't understand.

1069
01:12:40,895 --> 01:12:43,830
I don't   I don't see how things can
just go from being so great

1070
01:12:43,865 --> 01:12:46,629
one summer to turn
to such crap the next.

1071
01:12:50,373 --> 01:12:52,364
I'm sorry, Robin.

1072
01:12:53,644 --> 01:12:55,805
Can we talk?

1073
01:12:55,846 --> 01:12:58,610
I mean, privately?

1074
01:13:03,655 --> 01:13:07,557
Hey, Mr. Torvald.
I'm sorry I missed class.

1075
01:13:07,593 --> 01:13:09,561
Well, that's okay.

1076
01:13:09,595 --> 01:13:11,859
Are you feeling better?

1077
01:13:11,898 --> 01:13:15,231
What?
  If you missed my class,

1078
01:13:15,268 --> 01:13:17,327
you must be deathly ill.

1079
01:13:17,370 --> 01:13:20,203
It's too bad because we were gonna
work on your solo today.

1080
01:13:23,344 --> 01:13:26,211
I'm not ready for a solo.
  Yes, you are.

1081
01:13:26,248 --> 01:13:29,513
Don't you even know how much you've
improved since you've been here?

1082
01:13:29,551 --> 01:13:32,179
Okay, but there are much better singers
here, Mr. Torvald.

1083
01:13:32,221 --> 01:13:34,189
I'll be the judge of that.

1084
01:13:34,223 --> 01:13:36,191
We'll try it again tomorrow.

1085
01:13:36,225 --> 01:13:38,386
Look, Terri,

1086
01:13:38,429 --> 01:13:41,364
there's people in the class who are
desperate to do this solo,

1087
01:13:41,398 --> 01:13:44,196
so if you don't care
about the work,

1088
01:13:44,234 --> 01:13:46,225
what have you
been doing here?

1089
01:13:49,674 --> 01:13:53,110
This is so humiliating.
You're suppose to be with me.

1090
01:13:53,145 --> 01:13:55,204
Look, just

1091
01:13:55,247 --> 01:13:57,238
take it easy.

1092
01:13:59,953 --> 01:14:02,251
Worse things
have happened, right?

1093
01:14:02,289 --> 01:14:04,257
Yeah, all the time.

1094
01:14:04,291 --> 01:14:06,259
Just not to me.

1095
01:14:06,294 --> 01:14:09,661
I always get my way.

1096
01:14:12,601 --> 01:14:15,331
Is that a bad thing to say?
  Well, maybe a little, yeah.

1097
01:14:16,772 --> 01:14:19,036
But I thought you liked bad.

1098
01:14:20,844 --> 01:14:22,812
Maybe a little bad?

1099
01:14:22,846 --> 01:14:26,338
Come on, we got along
really well last summer, didn't we?

1100
01:14:26,384 --> 01:14:28,352
People change, Robin.

1101
01:14:28,386 --> 01:14:30,684
I'm not the same person
I was last summer.

1102
01:14:30,721 --> 01:14:32,689
Neither are you.

1103
01:14:32,724 --> 01:14:34,692
I don't know.

1104
01:14:34,726 --> 01:14:37,559
I think we can be those two people
again. Don't you?

1105
01:14:44,904 --> 01:14:46,337
Hey, have you seen Jay?

1106
01:14:46,373 --> 01:14:48,398
Uh, heading to the practice room,
I think.

1107
01:14:50,144 --> 01:14:52,237
I think I know the problem.

1108
01:14:54,249 --> 01:14:56,513
I'm bad.

1109
01:14:58,086 --> 01:15:00,554
But I can be better.

1110
01:15:10,934 --> 01:15:12,663
Terri, wait!
Terri!

1111
01:15:15,106 --> 01:15:17,074
Terri!
Terri, wait!

1112
01:15:17,108 --> 01:15:18,405
Terri!

1113
01:15:18,443 --> 01:15:21,241
Wait.
  Jerk!

1114
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:23,714
Terri!

1115
01:15:23,749 --> 01:15:27,947
Jay?
  Stay away from me! Terri!

1116
01:15:38,632 --> 01:15:40,623
Stupid.

1117
01:15:57,721 --> 01:16:01,817
I don't know your face

1118
01:16:01,860 --> 01:16:04,658
No more

1119
01:16:06,432 --> 01:16:09,560
Or feel the touch

1120
01:16:09,602 --> 01:16:12,594
That I adore

1121
01:16:16,610 --> 01:16:20,205
I don't know your face

1122
01:16:20,248 --> 01:16:23,615
No more

1123
01:16:24,619 --> 01:16:28,077
It's just a place

1124
01:16:28,123 --> 01:16:31,183
I'm looking for...

1125
01:16:33,696 --> 01:16:36,426
Terri, come on, please.
  She doesn't want to talk to you.

1126
01:16:36,466 --> 01:16:38,991
Just back off.

1127
01:16:39,035 --> 01:16:42,835
We might as well
be living

1128
01:16:42,873 --> 01:16:46,434
In another town

1129
01:16:46,477 --> 01:16:49,605
We might as well

1130
01:16:49,648 --> 01:16:53,607
We might
as well

1131
01:16:53,653 --> 01:16:56,315
We might as well

1132
01:16:56,355 --> 01:17:02,851
Be strangers...

1133
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:13,403
Be strangers

1134
01:17:15,377 --> 01:17:18,744
For all I know

1135
01:17:18,781 --> 01:17:23,411
Of you now

1136
01:17:25,121 --> 01:17:27,851
For all I know.

1137
01:17:30,127 --> 01:17:33,528
Aw, hey.
You okay?

1138
01:17:33,564 --> 01:17:37,193
It's nothing.

1139
01:17:37,235 --> 01:17:39,203
I'm sorry if I was hard
on you the other day.

1140
01:17:39,237 --> 01:17:42,104
I just want you to know
that I'm here for you

1141
01:17:42,141 --> 01:17:45,167
if you need anything.
If you want to talk. Anything.

1142
01:17:46,646 --> 01:17:48,637
Okay?

1143
01:17:53,654 --> 01:17:56,282
Have you ever lost anyone?

1144
01:17:56,324 --> 01:17:58,383
Yeah.

1145
01:17:59,661 --> 01:18:01,561
I just can't let this go.

1146
01:18:01,597 --> 01:18:03,565
Well, you're an artist

1147
01:18:03,599 --> 01:18:05,897
and artists
feel things differently

1148
01:18:05,935 --> 01:18:08,563
than regular people.

1149
01:18:08,605 --> 01:18:11,403
Look at Patsy Cline or

1150
01:18:11,441 --> 01:18:13,875
Billie Holiday.
You could hear it in their voice.

1151
01:18:13,910 --> 01:18:16,401
Or,

1152
01:18:16,447 --> 01:18:19,575
Vincent van Gogh. Cut off his ear,
but hey, he could paint.

1153
01:18:19,617 --> 01:18:22,085
Vincent van Gogh
killed himself.

1154
01:18:22,121 --> 01:18:24,521
That's right.
That's a bad example.

1155
01:18:26,291 --> 01:18:28,418
Hey, I'm a music teacher,
not a shrink.

1156
01:18:28,461 --> 01:18:31,089
What do you want?

1157
01:18:31,131 --> 01:18:33,258
I guess...

1158
01:18:33,299 --> 01:18:37,429
what I'm trying to say
is artists convey emotion.

1159
01:18:37,471 --> 01:18:41,567
They make an audience feel
what they're feeling.

1160
01:18:41,610 --> 01:18:43,805
You know, that's
what it's all about, right?

1161
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:47,048
You just have to find a way

1162
01:18:47,082 --> 01:18:49,050
to take what's in here

1163
01:18:49,085 --> 01:18:51,918
and put it in here.

1164
01:18:58,796 --> 01:19:01,321
What the hell. Who is it?

1165
01:19:01,366 --> 01:19:04,096
It's Jay.
Let me in!

1166
01:19:04,135 --> 01:19:06,467
Go away, you jackass!
  No, no, no!

1167
01:19:06,504 --> 01:19:09,064
I just   please, I just want
to talk to Terri, okay?

1168
01:19:09,108 --> 01:19:11,736
Just let me in.
  He sounds drunk.

1169
01:19:11,777 --> 01:19:13,745
Uh, you think?

1170
01:19:13,779 --> 01:19:16,077
Hey, girl,
do not open that door.

1171
01:19:16,116 --> 01:19:18,641
Okay, I'm gonna make
him leave, all right?

1172
01:19:18,685 --> 01:19:20,653
Jay, you have to leave now.

1173
01:19:20,687 --> 01:19:22,154
Wait, wait, wait.
  Okay?

1174
01:19:22,190 --> 01:19:24,624
No!
  Ow!

1175
01:19:24,659 --> 01:19:27,958
That hurt a lot.

1176
01:19:27,995 --> 01:19:30,259
Shh.
  No, it's not what you think.

1177
01:19:30,299 --> 01:19:31,766
What's going on?!

1178
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:33,768
I saw you kissing her, okay?
  No, no.

1179
01:19:33,802 --> 01:19:35,895
Shut up!
  You shut up!

1180
01:19:35,939 --> 01:19:37,907
Come on, Terri.
  I'm trying to sleep.

1181
01:19:37,941 --> 01:19:40,967
Sh   I wasn't kissing her.
She was   she was kissing me.

1182
01:19:41,010 --> 01:19:43,103
Oh no. He didn't even try
to go there, please.

1183
01:19:43,147 --> 01:19:45,115
I'm sure that makes
a lot of sense, Jay,

1184
01:19:45,149 --> 01:19:47,117
when you're drunk.
  Terri,

1185
01:19:47,151 --> 01:19:49,119
I don't care about her.

1186
01:19:49,154 --> 01:19:52,123
I care about you.
  Boy, who you trying to play?

1187
01:19:52,157 --> 01:19:55,558
Terri?
  Denise, just chill out, all right?

1188
01:19:55,595 --> 01:19:58,120
Look, Terri,

1189
01:19:58,164 --> 01:20:00,132
I care about you.

1190
01:20:00,166 --> 01:20:03,135
You know I do.
  Why would you do that?

1191
01:20:03,170 --> 01:20:05,161
Why would you drink?

1192
01:20:08,175 --> 01:20:11,201
Because, because I'm  
I'm worthless.

1193
01:20:11,246 --> 01:20:14,977
You know what? Don't even try and give
me that self pity thing, okay?

1194
01:20:15,016 --> 01:20:16,950
Terri, look.
Y'all need to relocate.

1195
01:20:16,986 --> 01:20:19,716
Okay, well, I'm never going to get him
past the night guard, so you

1196
01:20:19,755 --> 01:20:21,780
I'll be fine. I'll just  
  You have

1197
01:20:21,824 --> 01:20:24,349
You have to help me
get him up to the roof.

1198
01:20:24,394 --> 01:20:26,225
This is too much
drama for me.

1199
01:20:26,263 --> 01:20:28,231
Shh hh.
  I'm fine.

1200
01:20:28,265 --> 01:20:30,597
You're not fine, okay?

1201
01:20:30,635 --> 01:20:32,603
Oh wow!

1202
01:20:32,637 --> 01:20:36,334
I love this roof!
It's so cool.

1203
01:20:36,375 --> 01:20:39,003
Whoo!
  Oh, his breath is nasty.

1204
01:20:39,044 --> 01:20:41,012
Oh!

1205
01:20:41,046 --> 01:20:43,014
I'm spinning.

1206
01:20:43,049 --> 01:20:45,517
Help him!

1207
01:20:45,552 --> 01:20:47,520
Oh my God.

1208
01:20:47,554 --> 01:20:49,522
I'm out.

1209
01:20:49,557 --> 01:20:51,525
Thank you.

1210
01:20:51,559 --> 01:20:54,528
What did you do?
  I don't feel so good.

1211
01:20:54,562 --> 01:20:55,961
I'm sure you don't.

1212
01:20:55,997 --> 01:20:59,694
In a moment

1213
01:20:59,734 --> 01:21:03,295
Everything can change

1214
01:21:03,339 --> 01:21:07,366
Feel the wind
on your shoulder

1215
01:21:07,410 --> 01:21:09,708
For a minute

1216
01:21:09,746 --> 01:21:13,238
All the world can wait

1217
01:21:13,283 --> 01:21:17,652
Let go of your yesterday   
  Wake up.

1218
01:21:17,689 --> 01:21:20,317
Can you hear it calling?

1219
01:21:20,358 --> 01:21:23,156
Can you feel it
in your soul?

1220
01:21:23,195 --> 01:21:26,653
Can you trust this longing   
  Wake up, it's a new day.

1221
01:21:26,699 --> 01:21:28,997
And take control?

1222
01:21:29,034 --> 01:21:31,161
Fly

1223
01:21:31,204 --> 01:21:33,331
Open up the part of you

1224
01:21:33,373 --> 01:21:37,275
'Cause it's your time

1225
01:21:37,311 --> 01:21:42,146
Time to fly...

1226
01:21:46,388 --> 01:21:49,186
I'm really sorry.

1227
01:21:49,224 --> 01:21:51,692
Save it.
You're not forgiven yet.

1228
01:21:51,728 --> 01:21:54,458
Come on, let's go.

1229
01:22:01,071 --> 01:22:03,631
In a moment

1230
01:22:03,675 --> 01:22:07,509
Everything can change.

1231
01:22:07,545 --> 01:22:10,673
Frances!
Do you have the car keys?

1232
01:22:11,684 --> 01:22:13,743
Frances?

1233
01:22:13,786 --> 01:22:15,913
Car keys?

1234
01:22:32,074 --> 01:22:33,701
Frances?

1235
01:22:33,742 --> 01:22:37,303
So I wrote some new lyrics
and now all we have to do is practice,

1236
01:22:37,347 --> 01:22:39,212
so we can pull this off.
  Right.

1237
01:22:43,453 --> 01:22:45,148
Here's the music.

1238
01:22:47,124 --> 01:22:48,955
Okay, well,
let's start here.

1239
01:22:48,993 --> 01:22:51,393
I wanna work on the bridge.
  Okay.

1240
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:59,366
It doesn't matter
what people say

1241
01:22:59,405 --> 01:23:03,569
And it doesn't matter
how long it takes

1242
01:23:03,609 --> 01:23:08,706
Believe in yourself
and you'll fly

1243
01:23:08,749 --> 01:23:10,842
Okay.

1244
01:23:10,885 --> 01:23:14,514
It's not   let's, um, go again
and try it a little faster.

1245
01:23:14,556 --> 01:23:16,581
Okay.
  Okay.

1246
01:23:16,624 --> 01:23:18,285
It doesn't

1247
01:23:21,197 --> 01:23:23,358
Stop.

1248
01:23:23,399 --> 01:23:25,060
Okay, for real this time.
Let's go.

1249
01:23:28,505 --> 01:23:32,305
It doesn't matter
what people say

1250
01:23:33,945 --> 01:23:35,572
It sounded fine
the first time.

1251
01:23:35,613 --> 01:23:38,275
Okay, but "fine" is not going to win us
the scholarship.

1252
01:23:38,317 --> 01:23:39,909
Okay, it's gotta be right.

1253
01:23:39,952 --> 01:23:41,852
And I'm not gonna give up
until I nail it.

1254
01:23:41,887 --> 01:23:43,912
It'll drive me nuts.

1255
01:23:45,425 --> 01:23:48,087
It doesn't matter  
it doesn't matter

1256
01:23:48,128 --> 01:23:51,723
It doesn't matter
how long it takes

1257
01:23:51,766 --> 01:23:57,068
Believe in yourself
and you'll fly high.

1258
01:23:57,104 --> 01:23:59,572
What?
You did what?

1259
01:23:59,608 --> 01:24:01,473
She got accepted, Simon.

1260
01:24:01,510 --> 01:24:03,478
Out of all the applicants
in America,

1261
01:24:03,512 --> 01:24:06,003
our Terri got in.

1262
01:24:06,049 --> 01:24:08,643
You mean she's been there
this whole time?

1263
01:24:08,684 --> 01:24:10,652
Did you hear me?
  You   you lied to me?

1264
01:24:10,686 --> 01:24:12,813
Did you hear? Our daughter...
  You and Nina?

1265
01:24:12,856 --> 01:24:14,790
got into the best
music school in the country.

1266
01:24:14,825 --> 01:24:18,454
All of you lied to me.
All of you.

1267
01:24:20,365 --> 01:24:23,198
But Terri wanted to go.

1268
01:24:23,234 --> 01:24:25,202
Paul wanted her to go.

1269
01:24:25,237 --> 01:24:26,704
Paul!

1270
01:24:28,340 --> 01:24:30,934
Terri's singing again.
Why doesn't this matter to you?

1271
01:24:30,976 --> 01:24:34,810
What in God's name
is wrong with you, Frances?

1272
01:24:34,848 --> 01:24:38,181
What's wrong with me?

1273
01:24:38,219 --> 01:24:40,016
We just lost our son.

1274
01:24:40,054 --> 01:24:44,286
We were losing the only
child we have left.

1275
01:24:44,325 --> 01:24:46,316
I'm not gonna let
that happen.

1276
01:24:46,361 --> 01:24:48,352
That's my point.

1277
01:24:48,397 --> 01:24:51,696
She's just a child.
She's our child.

1278
01:24:51,734 --> 01:24:53,725
And how can I protect her
if she's not here?

1279
01:24:55,505 --> 01:24:57,700
I want her home.

1280
01:24:57,740 --> 01:24:59,731
I want her home now.

1281
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:52,264
Will you shut up in here?!

1282
01:25:52,304 --> 01:25:55,933
You are the loudest,
noisiest, rudest jerk on the planet!

1283
01:26:41,427 --> 01:26:43,122
Oh, ow!
  Sorry.

1284
01:27:09,692 --> 01:27:11,683
Thank you.

1285
01:27:13,430 --> 01:27:15,125
Thank you and welcome.

1286
01:27:15,165 --> 01:27:17,599
Well, it's time to bring
things to a close.

1287
01:27:17,635 --> 01:27:21,002
It's been great fun and we have even
more in store for you.

1288
01:27:21,039 --> 01:27:24,133
Today we have a full slate
of final performances.

1289
01:27:24,175 --> 01:27:27,269
And some of our performers
will be backed up by members

1290
01:27:27,313 --> 01:27:29,645
of the Bristol Hillman
House Band.

1291
01:27:29,682 --> 01:27:31,809
Oh my God!

1292
01:27:31,851 --> 01:27:34,319
What?
  I don't have Paul's necklace.

1293
01:27:34,354 --> 01:27:37,346
No, I can't do this
without him.

1294
01:27:37,391 --> 01:27:41,054
Terri? Terri, wait.
  No, uh, don't worry. I'll be back.

1295
01:27:41,095 --> 01:27:44,724
And give a hand to our first performer,
Miss Robin Childers.

1296
01:27:46,601 --> 01:27:49,729
All right!
  Yeah!

1297
01:27:58,615 --> 01:28:01,914
Let your body move
on the dance floor

1298
01:28:01,952 --> 01:28:05,820
Feel the rhythm
as your body gets warm...

1299
01:28:08,093 --> 01:28:10,618
Dad?
  Pack your things, Terri.

1300
01:28:10,662 --> 01:28:12,186
Let's go home.
  Daddy, no!

1301
01:28:12,230 --> 01:28:14,095
Not a word, Theresa.
Just do it.

1302
01:28:14,133 --> 01:28:17,000
Your mother's waiting
downstairs.

1303
01:28:19,072 --> 01:28:20,869
Uh   uh

1304
01:28:20,908 --> 01:28:22,603
Just as you head
is spinning

1305
01:28:22,643 --> 01:28:26,636
As you slowly start
to lose control.

1306
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:31,482
Go, Robin!

1307
01:28:35,324 --> 01:28:37,758
Thank you.
Great performance!

1308
01:28:37,793 --> 01:28:40,785
Our next performer
is Mr. Engelbert Wilson.

1309
01:28:40,831 --> 01:28:43,299
Engelbert?

1310
01:28:43,333 --> 01:28:45,324
Come on out, boy!

1311
01:28:45,369 --> 01:28:47,860
Kiwi!

1312
01:28:47,905 --> 01:28:50,339
Did you hear what I said?
Pack your things.

1313
01:28:50,375 --> 01:28:53,867
Dad, you know what? You did this to Paul
and now you're doing this to me.

1314
01:28:53,911 --> 01:28:55,742
Don't you dare
bring Paul into this.

1315
01:28:55,781 --> 01:28:57,681
Okay, well, I'm not gonna
let you hold me back.

1316
01:28:57,716 --> 01:29:00,776
You lied to me, Terri.
  And I'm sorry about that.

1317
01:29:00,819 --> 01:29:02,616
But I did what
I had to do.

1318
01:29:02,655 --> 01:29:06,853
Okay, you don't listen
to anybody, and we're all afraid of you.

1319
01:29:13,134 --> 01:29:15,364
She doesn't even know!

1320
01:29:23,846 --> 01:29:26,007
She wants the creature
from outer space

1321
01:29:29,086 --> 01:29:30,713
Gentlemen

1322
01:29:40,832 --> 01:29:42,493
Time is running out.

1323
01:29:42,535 --> 01:29:44,833
Dad...

1324
01:29:46,172 --> 01:29:49,141
this place is the scariest,
hardest

1325
01:29:49,176 --> 01:29:51,838
best thing that has ever
happened to me,

1326
01:29:51,878 --> 01:29:53,505
no matter
how I got here.

1327
01:29:53,547 --> 01:29:55,947
We'll discuss it at home.

1328
01:30:11,801 --> 01:30:13,962
I'm not leaving.

1329
01:30:14,003 --> 01:30:16,801
Okay, I did this

1330
01:30:16,841 --> 01:30:19,105
and I did this for me and I'm gonna
finish it for me.

1331
01:30:21,111 --> 01:30:22,976
You can take me home
if you want to, Dad.

1332
01:30:24,683 --> 01:30:26,844
But I'm performing
any minute now,

1333
01:30:26,885 --> 01:30:30,412
and it would mean the world to me if you
and Mom were there to support me.

1334
01:30:32,325 --> 01:30:34,486
I worked so hard here.

1335
01:30:34,527 --> 01:30:36,654
And I'm really good.

1336
01:30:36,697 --> 01:30:38,688
I want you to hear me.

1337
01:30:38,732 --> 01:30:40,324
Please, Dad.

1338
01:30:41,702 --> 01:30:46,162
Please, let me stay.

1339
01:31:24,518 --> 01:31:26,713
All right, Denise!
  Yes!

1340
01:31:28,055 --> 01:31:32,685
Yes, that was
wonderful, Denise.

1341
01:31:35,230 --> 01:31:37,221
Nice job, Denise!
  Thanks.

1342
01:31:37,266 --> 01:31:38,733
You were great, girl!

1343
01:31:39,035 --> 01:31:41,094
And now last,
but not least,

1344
01:31:41,137 --> 01:31:44,197
Theresa Fletcher
and Jay Corgan.

1345
01:31:57,356 --> 01:32:00,382
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm sorry to announce

1346
01:32:32,496 --> 01:32:35,090
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is my sincere pleasure

1347
01:32:35,132 --> 01:32:38,124
to present to you the distinctive vocal
stylings of the one,

1348
01:32:38,169 --> 01:32:41,400
the only,
Terri Fletcher!

1349
01:32:47,780 --> 01:32:49,771
Um

1350
01:32:52,285 --> 01:32:54,549
this song Jay
and I wrote together,

1351
01:32:54,588 --> 01:32:56,556
and, um, I would
like to dedicate it

1352
01:32:56,590 --> 01:32:58,854
to my brother,
Paul Fletcher.

1353
01:33:14,577 --> 01:33:18,206
I found myself today

1354
01:33:18,249 --> 01:33:24,017
Oh I found myself
and ran away

1355
01:33:27,092 --> 01:33:30,425
But something
pulled me back

1356
01:33:30,463 --> 01:33:36,231
The voice of reason,
I forgot I had

1357
01:33:36,269 --> 01:33:40,729
All I know
is you're not here to say

1358
01:33:40,774 --> 01:33:43,743
What you always
used to say

1359
01:33:43,777 --> 01:33:50,205
But it's written
in the sky tonight

1360
01:33:50,251 --> 01:33:53,778
So I won't give up

1361
01:33:53,823 --> 01:33:56,986
No, I won't break down

1362
01:33:57,026 --> 01:34:02,521
Sooner than it seems
life turns around

1363
01:34:02,566 --> 01:34:09,165
And I will be strong
even if it all goes wrong

1364
01:34:09,207 --> 01:34:15,510
When I'm standing in the dark,
I'll still believe

1365
01:34:15,547 --> 01:34:21,179
Someone's watching over me

1366
01:34:23,723 --> 01:34:27,022
I've seen
that bright light

1367
01:34:27,061 --> 01:34:32,727
And it's shining
on my destiny

1368
01:34:32,768 --> 01:34:39,674
Shining all the time,
and I won't be afraid

1369
01:34:39,709 --> 01:34:45,705
To follow everywhere
it's taking me

1370
01:34:45,749 --> 01:34:50,345
All I know
is yesterday is gone

1371
01:34:50,387 --> 01:34:53,720
And right now
I belong

1372
01:34:53,758 --> 01:34:59,458
To this moment,
to my dreams

1373
01:34:59,498 --> 01:35:02,558
So I won't give up

1374
01:35:02,601 --> 01:35:05,934
No, I won't break down

1375
01:35:05,972 --> 01:35:12,377
Sooner then it seems
life turns around

1376
01:35:12,413 --> 01:35:18,545
And I will be strong
even if it all goes wrong

1377
01:35:18,587 --> 01:35:25,356
When I'm standing in the dark,
I'll still believe

1378
01:35:25,395 --> 01:35:29,991
Someone's watching over me

1379
01:35:30,033 --> 01:35:33,093
It doesn't matter
what people say

1380
01:35:33,137 --> 01:35:36,163
And it doesn't matter
how long it takes

1381
01:35:36,207 --> 01:35:42,305
Believe in yourself
and you'll fly high

1382
01:35:42,347 --> 01:35:45,475
And it only matters
how true you are

1383
01:35:45,518 --> 01:35:52,424
Be true to yourself
and follow your heart

1384
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:56,354
So I won't give up

1385
01:35:56,396 --> 01:35:59,661
No, I won't break down

1386
01:35:59,701 --> 01:36:06,197
Sooner than it seems
life turns around

1387
01:36:06,242 --> 01:36:11,976
And I will be strong
even if it all goes wrong

1388
01:36:12,014 --> 01:36:18,613
When I'm standing in the dark,
I'll still believe

1389
01:36:18,655 --> 01:36:21,852
That I won't give up

1390
01:36:21,893 --> 01:36:24,919
No, I won't break down

1391
01:36:24,962 --> 01:36:31,197
Sooner than it seems
life turns around

1392
01:36:31,236 --> 01:36:37,334
And I will be strong
even when it all goes wrong

1393
01:36:37,377 --> 01:36:43,475
When I'm standing in the dark,
I'll still believe

1394
01:36:43,517 --> 01:36:47,544
That someone's
watching over

1395
01:36:47,589 --> 01:36:50,251
Someone's
watching over

1396
01:36:50,292 --> 01:36:55,628
Someone's
watching over me

1397
01:36:55,665 --> 01:36:59,658
Oh yeah,
oh, oh

1398
01:36:59,703 --> 01:37:02,831
Oh, o oh

1399
01:37:02,873 --> 01:37:06,400
Oh, oh...

1400
01:37:06,444 --> 01:37:09,379
Oh, oh

1401
01:37:09,414 --> 01:37:11,939
Oh, o oh

1402
01:37:11,983 --> 01:37:15,384
Oh, oh...

1403
01:37:15,421 --> 01:37:18,720
Oh, oh

1404
01:37:18,757 --> 01:37:23,990
Someone's watching over me.

1405
01:37:40,416 --> 01:37:42,247
Way to go, Terri!

1406
01:37:57,335 --> 01:37:59,826
You did it! You were awesome!
  We did it!

1407
01:37:59,872 --> 01:38:02,636
Nothing will ever top
what I just felt.

1408
01:38:02,875 --> 01:38:04,502
We got it.
  We got it?

1409
01:38:04,543 --> 01:38:06,204
Are you sure?
All right.

1410
01:38:11,351 --> 01:38:14,411
Each year we present
a $10,000 academic scholarship

1411
01:38:14,455 --> 01:38:18,448
in Music Studies to an outstanding
student in the summer music program.

1412
01:38:18,493 --> 01:38:21,587
This year's program
was better than most,

1413
01:38:21,630 --> 01:38:23,928
full of talented,
hardworking students.

1414
01:38:23,966 --> 01:38:26,560
It's a shame we only have
one scholarship to give.

1415
01:38:26,602 --> 01:38:30,299
So without further ado,
the board of directors

1416
01:38:30,340 --> 01:38:32,535
of the Bristol Hillman
Music Conservatory

1417
01:38:32,575 --> 01:38:36,841
is pleased to present
this scholarship to...

1418
01:38:38,949 --> 01:38:41,008
Denise Gilmore.

1419
01:39:24,602 --> 01:39:29,062
Oh honey! You were so wonderful!
  Oh, thank you!

1420
01:39:29,108 --> 01:39:32,134
Truly amazing, but then again,
it's in the genes.

1421
01:39:32,177 --> 01:39:34,805
Aunt Nina, thank you
for everything.

1422
01:39:37,217 --> 01:39:39,447
I wish you would
have won that scholarship.

1423
01:39:39,486 --> 01:39:41,317
No, Mom, it doesn't
even matter.

1424
01:39:41,355 --> 01:39:43,016
I just   I got to be up there,
you know?

1425
01:39:43,057 --> 01:39:45,582
Yeah.
  You um...

1426
01:39:46,627 --> 01:39:48,356
you were great, Terri.
Really.

1427
01:39:49,397 --> 01:39:51,160
Thank you, Dad.

1428
01:39:51,199 --> 01:39:53,895
Let me talk to you
for a second alone, all right?

1429
01:40:01,178 --> 01:40:02,611
I uh

1430
01:40:02,646 --> 01:40:04,443
I just want to tell
you I was wrong.

1431
01:40:04,481 --> 01:40:06,381
No, you know what, Dad?
I should have never

1432
01:40:06,416 --> 01:40:08,008
Just let me talk, please.

1433
01:40:10,188 --> 01:40:11,985
I just   I was wrong.

1434
01:40:12,023 --> 01:40:15,151
I can just be, uh, pretty hardheaded
sometimes, you know?

1435
01:40:15,194 --> 01:40:18,721
Anyway, I just wanted
to tell you that, uh...

1436
01:40:20,299 --> 01:40:22,927
it was probably the proudest
moment of my life

1437
01:40:22,969 --> 01:40:25,460
seeing you up there.

1438
01:40:27,340 --> 01:40:29,535
I just wish Paul
could have seen it.

1439
01:40:31,712 --> 01:40:33,179
Me too.

1440
01:40:42,792 --> 01:40:44,225
Hi.

1441
01:40:44,260 --> 01:40:46,785
The Fletchers have
an amazing daughter.

1442
01:40:46,829 --> 01:40:48,660
Thank you.
  Awesome.

1443
01:40:48,699 --> 01:40:51,259
We hope, uh, we see
her next year.

1444
01:40:53,204 --> 01:40:54,967
Well, you just might.

1445
01:40:55,006 --> 01:40:56,871
Good.

1446
01:41:05,527 --> 01:41:07,722
Hey, Terri.
Come on!

1447
01:41:18,404 --> 01:41:22,397
In this place
that has no name

1448
01:41:22,419 --> 01:41:25,149
I can't remember
why I came

1449
01:41:26,402 --> 01:41:29,701
And then I hear
you whispering

1450
01:41:29,721 --> 01:41:33,657
One more mile
to Jericho

1451
01:41:33,669 --> 01:41:36,797
Nothing is ever
what it seems

1452
01:41:36,822 --> 01:41:41,259
When you live
inside your dreams

1453
01:41:41,269 --> 01:41:45,797
The walls will tumble,
the walls will tumble

1454
01:41:45,817 --> 01:41:49,617
But I'm not
going to cry

1455
01:41:49,633 --> 01:41:53,933
My heart won't crumble,
my heart won't crumble

1456
01:41:53,948 --> 01:41:58,749
If we ever say goodbye

1457
01:42:05,995 --> 01:42:09,795
Everybody gets the joke

1458
01:42:09,812 --> 01:42:12,940
Where's the fire?
Where's the smoke?

1459
01:42:13,927 --> 01:42:17,192
Money, love and jealousy

1460
01:42:17,213 --> 01:42:21,013
Something's got
ahold of me

1461
01:42:21,030 --> 01:42:25,399
But I will follow
where you go

1462
01:42:25,410 --> 01:42:28,902
One more mile to Jericho

1463
01:42:28,928 --> 01:42:33,831
The walls will tumble,
the walls will tumble

1464
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:36,741
But I'm not gonna cry

1465
01:42:36,761 --> 01:42:41,789
My heart won't crumble,
my heart won't crumble

1466
01:42:41,805 --> 01:42:47,209
If we ever say goodbye

1467
01:42:48,243 --> 01:42:52,179
Goodbye now

1468
01:42:52,193 --> 01:42:56,152
Goodbye

1469
01:42:57,735 --> 01:43:01,466
One more mile,
one more kiss

1470
01:43:01,486 --> 01:43:05,149
One more word,
one more wish

1471
01:43:12,969 --> 01:43:17,406
The walls will tumble,
the walls will tumble

1472
01:43:17,416 --> 01:43:20,874
But I'm not gonna cry

1473
01:43:20,900 --> 01:43:25,200
My heart won't crumble,
my heart won't crumble

1474
01:43:25,215 --> 01:43:28,707
If we ever say goodbye

1475
01:43:28,733 --> 01:43:33,102
The walls will tumble,
the walls will tumble

1476
01:43:33,114 --> 01:43:36,515
But I'm not gonna cry

1477
01:43:36,532 --> 01:43:41,367
My heart won't crumble,
my heart won't crumble

1478
01:43:41,377 --> 01:43:45,473
If we ever say goodbye

1479
01:43:45,493 --> 01:43:48,792
My heart won't crumble,
my heart won't crumble

1480
01:43:48,812 --> 01:43:54,478
If we ever say goodbye

1481
01:43:54,486 --> 01:43:57,046
My heart won't crumble,
my heart won't crumble

1482
01:43:57,076 --> 01:44:01,843
If we ever say goodbye

1483
01:44:01,855 --> 01:44:05,222
My heart won't crumble,
my heart won't crumble

1484
01:44:05,240 --> 01:44:09,609
If we ever say goodbye

1485
01:44:09,620 --> 01:44:13,420
My heart won't crumble,
my heart won't crumble

1486
01:44:13,438 --> 01:44:18,432
If we ever say goodbye.

1487
01:44:19,432 --> 01:44:29,432
